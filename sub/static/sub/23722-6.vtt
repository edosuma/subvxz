Why were you defending them?

- to teach them rather than just...
- Yes.

- And I also said...
- ...fucking kicking them out,

a crime, it was unacceptable.

(BAG UNZIPS)
- Oh.

24:47.051 --> 24:48.384
- (BAG ZIPS)
- See you next class.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.485
Mm-hmm.

24:51.822 --> 24:54.789
Um, there's also a sauna downstairs,

24:54.825 --> 24:57.392
and you also should be sleeping too, Dad,

24:57.428 --> 24:58.893
which by the way...

24:58.929 --> 25:01.029
Ah. It's been a rough couple of nights,

25:01.064 --> 25:02.431
but it's nothing.

25:02.466 --> 25:05.267
I want it on the record, though,
despite appearances,

25:05.302 --> 25:07.502
- I was once an athlete.
- (LAUGHS)

25:07.537 --> 25:11.105
Yeah. And I was once
a great finger painter.

25:11.141 --> 25:12.263
Wait. Really?

25:12.299 --> 25:14.542
Yeah, I lettered at wide receiver

25:14.577 --> 25:16.076
my junior year of high school,

25:16.112 --> 25:18.146
played some varsity basketball, too.

25:18.181 --> 25:19.480
No college ball?

25:19.516 --> 25:22.216
No. I was recruited some, but no.

25:23.352 --> 25:24.548
MICHAEL: Why not?

25:26.054 --> 25:27.354
Well, I, uh...

25:28.690 --> 25:31.724
I found out my brother,
Archie, was dead...

25:32.561 --> 25:35.962
the summer before my senior year.

25:35.997 --> 25:38.898
He'd been MIA for a long time,

25:38.933 --> 25:41.400
but they found him, and, uh...

25:42.870 --> 25:44.637
Yeah, they found him...

25:44.672 --> 25:48.073
not far from where we would
find you, eventually.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.410
They recovered his body near my village?

25:51.445 --> 25:54.079
- GREG: Yeah.
- I never knew that.

25:56.184 --> 25:58.416
I guess I was...

25:58.451 --> 26:03.321
chasing some of Archie's
high school records, and...

26:05.258 --> 26:07.392
I didn't want them after that.

26:08.728 --> 26:12.697
It seemed... unimportant,
you know? So I quit.

26:14.733 --> 26:16.600
I'm sorry. I... I...

26:16.635 --> 26:20.237
It never occurred to me
how deeply the war had...

26:20.272 --> 26:23.006
- Dad, I'm so sorry.
- I had... I had no idea.

26:26.512 --> 26:28.245
Ah. Anyway...

26:30.082 --> 26:31.581
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

26:32.717 --> 26:36.085
Listen, we got to get going.
We have class in a half hour.

26:38.489 --> 26:41.591
Oh. Wait. Um... actually...

26:43.428 --> 26:46.862
This is the foreword.
I'm sorry it took so long.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.931
I just wanted to get it right.

26:49.966 --> 26:52.601
Oh. Thanks, Dad.

26:55.477 --> 26:57.410
Yeah. I hope you like it.

26:57.807 --> 27:00.908
(TRAFFIC SOUNDS)

27:07.350 --> 27:13.354
For example, Rockland Elementary,
which is overwhelmingly white,

27:13.389 --> 27:17.725
had recently begun an initiative
to teach Civil Rights history.

27:18.961 --> 27:21.328
But... it backfired.

27:21.364 --> 27:24.830
The white kids started bullying
some of the younger black kids

27:24.866 --> 27:26.499
into riding in the back of the bus.

27:26.534 --> 27:27.800
They Rosa Parks'ed 'em.

27:27.835 --> 27:30.870
And by the sixth grade,
those same black kids

27:30.905 --> 27:33.506
were using the back of
the bus as a place of...

27:34.409 --> 27:36.442
power, control...

27:36.478 --> 27:38.478
and sometimes revenge.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.446
And by the time that I got there to talk

27:41.482 --> 27:43.515
to these kids, black and white...

27:43.550 --> 27:46.117
half of them had forgotten
where it all started.

27:46.153 --> 27:47.653
It had just curdled...

27:47.688 --> 27:50.355
until they were asked to see it

27:50.391 --> 27:53.825
from each other's side,
really see it, you know?

27:56.029 --> 27:58.529
(SIGHS) Excellent.

27:59.499 --> 28:01.064
I love it. I'm sold.

28:01.100 --> 28:02.767
Uh, well, wait. Um...

28:03.803 --> 28:06.036
We... We have to build
from the ground level,

28:06.071 --> 28:07.938
you know, teacher education,

28:07.973 --> 28:10.675
neighborhood-specific
cross-cultural immersion,

28:10.710 --> 28:12.889
conflict resolution programming.

28:12.914 --> 28:14.653
I said, "Sold." You going
to talk me out of it?

28:14.688 --> 28:17.578
Well, you need to know this,
so I can justify the budget.

28:17.603 --> 28:18.639
What's the budget?

28:23.722 --> 28:26.823
- It's right...
- Oh.

28:28.159 --> 28:30.426
Right there.

28:30.461 --> 28:33.595
Um, right... 865 annually

28:33.631 --> 28:36.565
for three salaried program specialists,

28:36.600 --> 28:40.168
besides myself, for, uh, support staff,

28:40.204 --> 28:43.205
- uh, office space...
- Denied.

28:44.742 --> 28:47.075
You're thinking too small.
Forget ground level.

28:47.110 --> 28:50.678
How about we design a pilot
program for the entire state?

28:50.714 --> 28:54.915
Let's figure out how we can prove
this model to the whole country.

28:54.951 --> 28:57.318
Refigure your budget
with some more zeros,

28:57.354 --> 28:59.821
get a new staffing count,
and in six months,

28:59.856 --> 29:04.225
we'll be pitching this thing
to three more states. Deal?

29:05.894 --> 29:08.027
This is your office, by the way.

29:08.063 --> 29:10.230
See you tomorrow morning.

29:14.737 --> 29:17.604
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

29:21.509 --> 29:23.942
How often do you think
about killing somebody?

29:25.480 --> 29:28.947
Uh, not that much. Bi-monthly?

29:28.983 --> 29:31.450
How detailed? Like, what's your method?

29:31.486 --> 29:34.353
(CHUCKLES) I think just
beating them to death.

29:34.389 --> 29:37.956
I've never been in a fight though,
so I doubt it'd play out that well.

29:37.992 --> 29:40.191
I think about it a lot,

29:40.226 --> 29:42.627
like once a day.

29:42.662 --> 29:44.061
And I don't even have
to be mad about anything.

29:44.097 --> 29:47.399
Like, I thought about throwing you
in front of a car the other day.

29:47.434 --> 29:48.633
Okay.

29:49.703 --> 29:51.335
- I got to go.
- Wait. Why?

29:51.371 --> 29:53.137
I don't... I don't want
to kill you right now.

29:53.172 --> 29:54.606
I'm going to Friday noon prayer.

29:54.641 --> 29:56.607
I missed last week, and I'm already late.

29:56.642 --> 29:59.309
- Can I come?
- Why are you mopey?

29:59.344 --> 30:01.412
I told Ramon.

30:01.447 --> 30:05.382
Ah. Okay, come on,
but you can't wear that.

30:09.388 --> 30:11.121
- Have a good night. He was great today.
- Oh great.

30:11.156 --> 30:14.156
Oh, Ms. Collins, hi.
I'll grab Hailey for you.

30:14.191 --> 30:16.258
Hailey, Mommy's here!

30:16.294 --> 30:19.328
ASHLEY: What's the matter, baby?
What's wrong?

30:21.666 --> 30:23.198
Baby, you don't want to tell Mommy?

30:23.234 --> 30:25.301
Mommy, are we poopy?

30:25.336 --> 30:27.670
What? Did someone call you poopy?

30:27.705 --> 30:29.271
Chloe did.

30:30.674 --> 30:31.940
Why would she say that?

30:31.975 --> 30:34.409
Because I'm brown.

30:34.445 --> 30:36.277
Oh my God.

30:36.313 --> 30:38.346
You're poopy too.

30:40.116 --> 30:42.317
Honey, can you point out Chloe to Mommy?

30:45.456 --> 30:46.554
That's a new coat?

30:46.589 --> 30:47.988
WOMAN: Yes, it is.

30:48.023 --> 30:51.325
Have a seat, baby. Listen. Look at Mommy.

30:52.194 --> 30:54.090
You're not poopy, okay?

30:54.519 --> 30:57.163
I want you to put everything in your
backpack. I'm going to be right back.

30:57.198 --> 30:58.799
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:06.207 --> 31:08.541
Just perfect. Jacket cost me a fortune.

31:08.577 --> 31:10.577
- Just send me an e-mail. Great.
- I will. I will definitely.

- Thank you so much.
- Okay.

- Hi. Chloe's mom?
- Yes.

Hi, I'm Hailey's mom, Ashley.

Hailey, Hailey. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

31:18.453 --> 31:21.353
You are... you are Malcolm's wife.

31:21.388 --> 31:23.121
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

31:23.156 --> 31:24.351
- Mmm.
- Babette Gibson.

31:24.387 --> 31:26.157
Good to meet you, Babette. Hi, Chloe.

31:26.193 --> 31:28.694
- Hi.
- Hi. Uh, can we... can we talk?

31:28.729 --> 31:31.229
Oh. Sure. Yeah, of course.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.831
Can you play for just one more second?
Mm-hmm.

31:32.867 --> 31:35.501
Yes? Okay, I'll be there
in a second. Yeah?

31:35.536 --> 31:39.269
What's going on?
So, Hailey is really upset.

31:39.305 --> 31:43.608
Apparently Chloe told her that she
is poopy because she is brown.

31:43.643 --> 31:44.976
- Oh my God.
- Right.

31:45.011 --> 31:48.412
Yeah, so I was hoping that you could
talk to Chloe about it and maybe...

31:48.447 --> 31:50.748
Oh, Chloe would never say
something like that.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.365
- Excuse me?
- No. Never.

31:52.401 --> 31:55.118
She would never ever
say something like that.

31:55.153 --> 31:59.188
I... It must have been somebody else.
I am so sorry. That is...

31:59.224 --> 32:02.125
Well, Mrs. Gibson, Hailey doesn't
make things like this up,

32:02.160 --> 32:05.862
and I've never even heard her use
the word "poopy" before, so...

32:05.898 --> 32:07.296
Yeah, but Chloe simply never would.

32:07.332 --> 32:09.799
I mean, I've never heard her
use the word either.

32:09.835 --> 32:12.067
Yeah. I am so sorry.

32:12.102 --> 32:15.404
I mean, my... my brother-in-law
is Indian, and...

32:15.439 --> 32:18.073
- What... I don't...
- And the word "poopy"?

32:18.108 --> 32:20.609
"Poopy." No. I'm so sorry.

32:20.645 --> 32:23.546
I'm... I... look. (CHUCKLES) I get it.

32:23.581 --> 32:26.515
Talking about skin color
can be really uncomfortable.

32:26.551 --> 32:28.316
(LAUGHS) Are you really going to...

32:28.352 --> 32:30.919
Let's... No, you're not. (LAUGHING)

32:32.722 --> 32:35.657
- No, you're not. Are you serious?
- Yes.

32:35.692 --> 32:40.227
(LAUGHS) Mrs. Malcolm, listen. Listen.

32:40.263 --> 32:43.631
We teach our children that there
is no such thing as skin color.

32:43.667 --> 32:44.933
- Mmm.
- Right?

32:44.968 --> 32:48.835
- We're all just people, so.
- Mmm.

32:48.871 --> 32:51.204
And truthfully,
when your daughter, Hailey,

32:51.239 --> 32:53.206
called my Chloe a carrot head,

32:53.241 --> 32:54.860
- last month...
- Mmm.

32:55.415 --> 32:57.477
That happened, so I didn't come running

32:57.512 --> 32:59.713
to you and your husband and accuse you

32:59.748 --> 33:04.450
of... all this with the
poopies and you know.

33:04.485 --> 33:07.352
Chloe! My love, we're going to go.

33:07.388 --> 33:10.656
I am so sorry about that. Yeah. Oh. Oh.

33:10.692 --> 33:13.425
So sorry. Oh God.

33:15.597 --> 33:18.831
- That's awful. I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. It is. It is.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.431
- See you tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.

33:20.467 --> 33:22.200

was going to be like...

33:32.512 --> 33:34.087
Looks like a store.

33:34.122 --> 33:36.847
Yeah, we had a minaret
and a big sign for the front

33:36.882 --> 33:38.315
that said "Chock full of Muslims,"

33:38.350 --> 33:40.217
but then we decided against it.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.819
Hilarious.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.321
