WEBVTT

00:02.051 --> 00:04.216
Max, can you watch my tables
while I run to the restroom?

00:04.336 --> 00:05.452
I already am.

00:05.454 --> 00:06.903
I've been watching model girl

00:06.905 --> 00:09.589
pretend she's eating for 30 minutes.

00:09.591 --> 00:10.791
Oh, she's nice.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.693
She always tips
on what she would've eaten.

00:15.880 --> 00:16.964
Guess what, everyone?

00:16.966 --> 00:18.432
I have a secret.

00:18.434 --> 00:19.933
You're a woman trapped in a man's body?

00:19.935 --> 00:21.184
No.

00:21.186 --> 00:22.970
You're a man trapped in a woman's body?

00:22.972 --> 00:24.521
You're a little boy

00:24.523 --> 00:25.973
trapped in a little girl's body?

00:25.975 --> 00:28.358
I am a man in a man's body.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.728
We're not talking about your night life.

00:31.730 --> 00:34.314
I have discovered something when going over

00:34.316 --> 00:35.932
the employee applications.

00:35.934 --> 00:39.236
Okay, perhaps I never worked
at the Waldorf Astoria,

00:39.238 --> 00:43.106
but I did work with this guy,
Waldorf, in Astoria.

00:43.108 --> 00:46.126
It's not you. Tomorrow is Caroline's birthday.

00:46.128 --> 00:48.161
Why wouldn't I know that?

00:48.163 --> 00:50.330
She tells me everything about her life.

00:50.332 --> 00:51.748
I know so much about her cycle,

00:51.750 --> 00:54.668
I'm feeling pressure to impregnate her.

00:54.670 --> 00:57.421
I can do that for you.

00:57.423 --> 00:58.672
It's weird.

00:58.674 --> 01:00.791
Why wouldn't she want
to celebrate her birthday?

01:00.793 --> 01:02.125
She celebrates everything.

01:02.127 --> 01:04.010
Heads up, everybody.

01:04.013 --> 01:05.929
I just refilled the paper towels.

01:05.931 --> 01:10.867
Who's a team player? What, what?

01:10.753 --> 01:11.986
# ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:14.707 --> 01:16.454
# ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh #

01:25.722 --> 01:27.089
Max.

01:27.091 --> 01:28.724
You know what we have to do.

01:28.726 --> 01:31.160
Aw, man. I knew this day would come.

01:31.162 --> 01:36.148
All right, what's the least
amount I can do to keep my job?

01:36.150 --> 01:38.767
Just tell me when it's over.

01:38.769 --> 01:40.519
And when it starts.

01:40.521 --> 01:43.555
It's time to talk about Caroline's birthday.

01:43.557 --> 01:45.107
You have to throw her a party.

01:45.109 --> 01:46.608
I'd rather you just

01:46.610 --> 01:49.912
have your tiny way with me.

01:49.914 --> 01:52.531
I don't like birthdays.
I don't even know when mine is.

01:52.533 --> 01:56.785
My mom narrowed it down
to a two-week window in June.

01:58.371 --> 02:00.673
But you are Caroline's BFF.

02:00.675 --> 02:03.625
And it is BFF's job
to throw friend a party.

02:03.627 --> 02:04.710
Han, I don't have enough money

02:04.712 --> 02:06.011
to throw a party.

02:06.013 --> 02:09.247
I don't even have enough money
to throw a baseball.

02:09.249 --> 02:11.133
You have money. You be her BFF.

02:11.135 --> 02:14.436
I already have a BFF-- Jamarcus.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.055
And my last birthday,

02:16.057 --> 02:18.474
he threw me a sick surprise party.

02:18.476 --> 02:21.393
You must think BFF stands
for "barely freaking friends",

02:21.395 --> 02:23.028
because there's no way you're down

02:23.030 --> 02:24.563
with someone named Jamarcus.

02:24.565 --> 02:25.647
Oh, really?

02:25.649 --> 02:29.935
Then why did we exchange
ATM pin numbers?

02:29.937 --> 02:32.771
Oh...

02:32.773 --> 02:35.541
I'll just crop that, and we'll be good to go.

02:35.543 --> 02:38.777
Max, Edwin's ready to show us
the design for our new website.

02:38.779 --> 02:40.329
Come see it.

02:40.331 --> 02:42.664
Dude, you and the webmaster
have been talking "business"

02:42.666 --> 02:44.282
every day for a week.

02:44.284 --> 02:45.501
Is something going on there?

02:45.503 --> 02:48.303
Shouldn't the web be mastered by now?

02:48.305 --> 02:50.339
It's strictly business.

02:50.341 --> 02:52.508
All right, but it's costing us $200.

02:52.510 --> 02:54.977
Might as well get something out of it.

02:54.979 --> 02:59.631
Maybe let him browse your Yahoo?

02:59.633 --> 03:01.900
Looks like he might have
a big ol' hard drive

03:01.902 --> 03:04.787
with a lot of ram.

03:04.789 --> 03:07.773
Yeah, he's cute, but I don't
want a relationship right now.

03:07.775 --> 03:09.408
And I don't do one-night stands.

03:09.410 --> 03:11.810
All right, so don't stand. Lay down.

03:11.812 --> 03:13.112
That's not me--

03:13.114 --> 03:15.313
the next morning,
doing the walk of shame.

03:15.315 --> 03:18.200
I always see those girls
with their messed-up sex hair,

03:18.202 --> 03:20.152
carrying their heels,
clutching their coats

03:20.154 --> 03:21.486
to hide last night's outfit.

03:21.488 --> 03:23.822
Going into Kinko's to use Google maps

03:23.824 --> 03:26.508
so you can figure out where you are.

03:26.510 --> 03:31.880
You really put the "ho" in "Kinko."

03:31.882 --> 03:34.016
Oh. Sorry, Sophie.

03:34.018 --> 03:34.967
We're closed.

03:34.969 --> 03:36.435
Oh, no. I'll be quick.

03:36.437 --> 03:38.353
I just want a cupcake to go.

03:38.473 --> 03:42.191
I'm on my way to 24 hour fitness.

03:42.193 --> 03:47.446
Ja, and I put it on the cupcake
holder on the treadmill.

03:49.867 --> 03:53.118
Uh, Max,
my town car is parked out front

03:53.120 --> 03:55.454
and I was wondering
if you wanted me to wait

03:55.456 --> 03:58.123
for you and Caroline to give you
a ride back to our building.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.458
Oh, no. It's okay.

03:59.460 --> 04:00.742
We still have to clean up
and take the garbage out.

04:00.744 --> 04:02.127
Oh.

04:06.299 --> 04:11.369
Oh, looks like the garbage
is taking itself out.

04:11.371 --> 04:14.506
The game continues.

04:14.508 --> 04:15.808
Here is my number.

04:15.810 --> 04:17.341
I invite you to call me

04:17.344 --> 04:19.478
when you realize what a catch I am.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.364
Or any time you are drunk and willing.

04:22.366 --> 04:25.684
Max, I'm going to need the doggy bag as well.

04:25.686 --> 04:27.436
Not for the cupcake.

04:27.438 --> 04:30.689
To puke in.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.560
So I'll get this finalized,

04:35.562 --> 04:37.229
and then I'll stop
by the diner tomorrow

04:37.231 --> 04:39.915
so you can sign off on
the layout before we go live.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.583
This is so exciting.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.735
Oh, wait, Edwin. Shoot.

04:43.737 --> 04:45.621
I forgot to show you
the new pricing chart.

04:45.623 --> 04:47.289
It's cool, I can draft it up right now

04:47.291 --> 04:48.573
and upload it when I get home.

04:48.575 --> 04:50.876
Yeah, webmaster. You work pretty fast.

04:50.878 --> 04:53.378
But I bet you can work slow, too.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.631
And really fast again.

04:55.633 --> 04:57.266
I can be done in a minute.

04:57.268 --> 04:59.101
Ooh, not what you want to hear.

04:59.103 --> 05:00.686
Max.

05:00.688 --> 05:02.604
It's fine. We can wait.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.106
You know what? You stay here.

05:04.108 --> 05:06.608
I have to go to the store
and pick up stuff for your--

05:06.610 --> 05:08.060
my what?

05:08.062 --> 05:12.781
Your cupcake business that
you're making me do with you.

05:12.783 --> 05:13.932
Get home safe.

05:13.934 --> 05:15.951
Um, hey, where do you live, Edwin?

05:15.953 --> 05:17.069
Hell's kitchen.

05:17.071 --> 05:18.237
Oh, cool.

05:18.239 --> 05:19.571
You're going to want
to take the "c" down,

05:19.573 --> 05:21.240
transfer to the "l,"
and if you get lost,

05:21.242 --> 05:23.408
there's a Kinko's on 6th and 14th.

05:23.410 --> 05:26.862
That's embarrassing. Max was just trying to--

05:26.864 --> 05:28.947
yeah, I work on complicated web programs.

05:28.949 --> 05:31.333
I think I cracked that code.

05:31.335 --> 05:32.801
She wants us to hook up.

05:32.803 --> 05:35.120
Yeah. I'm sorry.

05:35.122 --> 05:36.288
Why are you sorry?

05:36.290 --> 05:39.958
That's all I've been thinking about.

05:50.820 --> 05:53.989
Yum, yum.

05:53.991 --> 05:56.808
Oh, my God.

05:56.810 --> 05:59.361
They are so hot.

06:10.489 --> 06:13.175
Don't give me that look.

06:24.938 --> 06:26.021
Oleg.

06:26.023 --> 06:27.306
Caroline.

06:27.308 --> 06:28.857
What are you doing here?

06:28.859 --> 06:30.559
What are you doing here?

06:30.561 --> 06:33.395
I live here, and I'm just coming out

06:33.397 --> 06:35.013
from going to get coffee.

06:35.015 --> 06:37.699
It was delicious.
I drank every bit of it.

06:37.701 --> 06:40.118
Outside. That's why I don't have a cup.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.188
But you're wearing
the same outfit from last night.

06:43.190 --> 06:46.074
You're wearing the same outfit
from last night.

06:46.076 --> 06:48.460
And you have messed-up sex hair.

06:48.462 --> 06:51.129
You have messed-up sex hair.

06:51.131 --> 06:53.382
Webmaster?

06:53.384 --> 06:55.400
Sophie?

06:55.402 --> 06:58.503
She called me up and we made hand love.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.372
But I thought Sophie hated you.

07:00.374 --> 07:04.209
Well, she doesn't hate my hand.

07:04.211 --> 07:05.894
But you cannot tell anyone.

07:05.896 --> 07:07.429
That was her one condition.

07:07.431 --> 07:09.514
That and a copy
of my recent blood tests

07:09.516 --> 07:11.600
signed by a medical professional.

07:11.602 --> 07:12.717
Deal.

07:12.719 --> 07:14.403
And you can't tell
anyone about me, either.

07:14.405 --> 07:15.320
Especially Max.

07:15.322 --> 07:16.772
I'd never hear the end of it.

07:16.774 --> 07:17.739
Deal.

07:17.741 --> 07:18.740
Pinky swear?

07:18.742 --> 07:19.891
Actually, never mind.

07:19.893 --> 07:21.026
I don't know where
your fingers have been.

07:21.028 --> 07:24.696
I just told you where they've been.

07:28.399 --> 07:29.666
Max

07:29.786 --> 07:32.488
I'm so excited for this party.

07:32.490 --> 07:36.825
I wore my loose clothing
so I can dance all night.

07:36.827 --> 07:39.295
God, I cannot take this party pressure.

07:39.297 --> 07:40.329
I'm just going to go in the back

07:40.331 --> 07:42.915
and run a can opener across my wrist.

07:42.917 --> 07:45.417
Oh, Max. I'm sure you did a great job.

07:45.419 --> 07:47.920
You know, as long as you have a DJ,

07:47.922 --> 07:50.890
some champagne, and a psychic.

07:50.892 --> 07:53.709
No, no, and no.

07:53.711 --> 07:55.644
I got some balloons, a hummus tray,

07:55.646 --> 07:56.979
and possibly Earl.

07:56.981 --> 07:59.131
He still hasn't confirmed.

07:59.133 --> 08:00.215
Oh.

08:00.217 --> 08:01.650
You don't need psychic to know

08:01.652 --> 08:05.154
that this is going to be
a horrible, horrible party.

08:05.156 --> 08:07.439
Well, thank God
Caroline has new boy toy.

08:07.441 --> 08:09.391
She might not mind as much.

08:09.393 --> 08:10.943
What are you talking about?

08:10.945 --> 08:14.280
Yeah, I saw them kissing in
front of the diner last night.

08:14.282 --> 08:18.284
Yeah, I sat there
and watched for an hour.

08:19.503 --> 08:23.005
They were really going at it,
hot and heavy.

08:23.007 --> 08:27.293
You know, like the Showtime
network in the good old days.

08:27.295 --> 08:28.410
Oh, great.

08:28.412 --> 08:30.212
Now I have to invite him
to the party, too?

08:30.214 --> 08:32.431
I only got a six-pack of Capri Suns,

08:32.433 --> 08:34.799
so people are going to have to share.

08:34.802 --> 08:36.852
Congratulations, it's official.

08:36.854 --> 08:38.304
Our website is now live.

08:38.306 --> 08:40.188
Congratulations, it's official.

08:40.191 --> 08:43.225
You're a whore.

08:43.227 --> 08:46.779
I hear you got
your Kinko's card punched.

08:46.781 --> 08:48.063
What?

08:48.065 --> 08:49.198
Don't "what" me.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.951
I know you hooked up
with the webmaster.

08:51.953 --> 08:53.235
Pick up.

08:53.237 --> 08:55.437
Oleg, you told Max?

08:55.439 --> 08:57.456
What's happening?

08:57.458 --> 08:58.490
Our deal's off.

08:58.492 --> 09:00.993
Oleg had sex with Sophie last night.

09:00.995 --> 09:02.294
No...

09:02.296 --> 09:05.881
It wasn't sex. Just hand stuff.

09:05.883 --> 09:07.666
Yeah, and nothing above the waist.

09:07.668 --> 09:11.053
I'm a lady.

09:11.055 --> 09:15.674
I got all hot and bothered
watching Caroline and big Han.

09:15.676 --> 09:19.178
Okay...

09:19.180 --> 09:22.047
You know, I really think
this is between Caroline and me.

09:22.049 --> 09:24.984
You mean between Caroline,
you, and your strippers.

09:24.986 --> 09:26.402
Strippers?

09:26.404 --> 09:28.737
I have seen this man in a strip club.

09:28.739 --> 09:31.323
Han, you were in a strip club?

09:31.325 --> 09:34.493
Earl took me.

09:40.149 --> 09:41.033
Damn it, Han.

09:41.035 --> 09:42.201
You're going to sell me out

09:42.203 --> 09:46.171
after I spotted you $100 in ones.

09:46.173 --> 09:49.792
You went to Spreaders without me?

09:49.794 --> 09:52.711
Why would you take Han to a strip club?

09:52.713 --> 09:56.164
Yeah, is his lap even big enough for a dance?

09:56.166 --> 09:58.384
Earl, I'm so disappointed in you.

09:58.386 --> 10:00.886
That's it. I'm not going to your party.

10:00.888 --> 10:01.937
What party?

10:01.939 --> 10:03.188
Damn it, Earl!

10:03.190 --> 10:05.774
It's supposed to be
a surprise for her birthday.

10:05.776 --> 10:07.843
Who told you it was my birthday?

10:07.845 --> 10:09.028
Han.

10:09.030 --> 10:10.562
Damn it, Han!

10:10.564 --> 10:12.281
I didn't want a party

10:12.283 --> 10:14.116
and I don't want to celebrate
my birthday this year.

10:14.118 --> 10:15.451
Well, too bad,

10:15.453 --> 10:18.404
because your BFF is throwing you
a big blow-out.

10:18.406 --> 10:20.906
Oh, Max. Now I feel bad.

10:20.908 --> 10:24.743
You feel bad now, wait till you see the party.

10:28.664 --> 10:32.500
Caroline's birthday. Woot, woot.

10:32.502 --> 10:35.803
Thanks, but you don't have
to say that after everything.

10:35.805 --> 10:38.840
Max...

10:38.842 --> 10:41.125
I know you had limited budget,

10:41.127 --> 10:43.311
but music is free.

10:43.313 --> 10:47.765
Yeah, well, I'm a douche.

10:47.767 --> 10:51.319
Speech!

10:51.321 --> 10:54.355
Speech!

10:54.357 --> 10:58.058
I can't carry this party much longer.

10:59.728 --> 11:01.228
Okay, I'd like to say something.

11:01.230 --> 11:02.280
Wait, wait.

11:02.282 --> 11:04.732
Can't we wait till we cut the cake?

11:04.734 --> 11:06.066
Cake?

11:06.068 --> 11:08.336
People are still doing that?

11:08.338 --> 11:12.840
Yes. Our livelihood depends on it.

11:12.842 --> 11:15.426
There's only one party as bad as this one.

11:15.428 --> 11:20.598
That's the Donner Party.

11:22.101 --> 11:27.205
And even they had better food.

11:27.207 --> 11:30.725
I'd like to say happy birthday
to a very pretty lady

11:30.727 --> 11:32.643
who I just had the pleasure of meeting,

11:32.645 --> 11:35.329
and I think I'm going
to be seeing a lot more of her.

11:35.331 --> 11:36.697
Aw.

11:36.699 --> 11:38.766
I'll go get us some more drinks.

11:38.768 --> 11:40.100
Okay.

11:40.102 --> 11:42.787
Get rid of him.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.238
What?

11:44.240 --> 11:45.406
It was a one-time thing.

11:45.408 --> 11:47.458
I thought you weren't that kind of girl.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.109
I realized it had almost been a year

11:49.111 --> 11:50.711
since I had sex, and I decided

11:50.713 --> 11:52.997
I rather not be that kind of girl.

11:52.999 --> 11:54.248
But I don't want a relationship.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.134
Hey, I get it. Hit it and quit it.

11:56.136 --> 11:57.718
# hit it, don't babysit it #

11:57.720 --> 12:00.221
Max, please.

12:00.223 --> 12:01.172
Fine.

12:01.174 --> 12:02.223
How am I going to make him go away?

12:02.225 --> 12:03.341
It's not going to take a lot

12:03.343 --> 12:05.626
to convince someone
to leave this party.

12:05.628 --> 12:09.397
I'd like to ask everyone
to raise their cocktail,

12:09.399 --> 12:10.348
but I can't.

12:10.350 --> 12:14.685
So raise your Capri to the sun...

12:16.471 --> 12:20.681
For a very special lady who I'm
sure I will be seeing more of.

12:27.749 --> 12:31.502
Get rid of him. It was a one-time thing.

12:32.505 --> 12:35.423
So was that the worst party
you've ever been to?

12:35.425 --> 12:38.826
That was the worst party
anyone's ever been to.

12:38.828 --> 12:42.663
So with the webmaster, how was the sex?

12:42.665 --> 12:44.432
Pretty good.

12:44.434 --> 12:45.600
But then he did that thing

12:45.602 --> 12:47.469
where he pretended
he was going to choke me.

12:47.471 --> 12:49.354
When did guys start doing that?

12:49.356 --> 12:50.305
I don't know,

12:50.307 --> 12:51.606
but if I knew that was his thing,

12:51.608 --> 12:53.508
I would've asked him
to choke me at the party.

12:53.510 --> 12:54.943
How did you get rid of him?

12:54.945 --> 12:56.978
What did you say?
Did you let him down gently?

12:56.980 --> 12:59.064
No, I told him to hit the pike.

12:59.066 --> 13:01.149
It's a one-night stand. Guys get that.

13:01.151 --> 13:03.818
So that's it? He wasn't upset?

13:03.820 --> 13:05.904
Guys don't care.

13:05.906 --> 13:08.623
One-night stands-- they come, they go.

13:08.625 --> 13:09.690
Literally.

13:09.692 --> 13:11.960
But what if he wants to see me again?

13:11.962 --> 13:12.994
Relax.

13:12.996 --> 13:14.462
It is not going
to come back to haunt you.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.414
Unless you start feeling an itch...

13:16.416 --> 13:18.299
Or a kick.

13:18.301 --> 13:19.801
Well, thanks for dumping him.

13:19.803 --> 13:21.002
And for the...

13:21.004 --> 13:23.922
I'm going to go ahead
and call it a party.

13:23.924 --> 13:25.724
I knew you wouldn't want me

13:25.726 --> 13:27.392
to use any of the cupcake money,

13:27.394 --> 13:28.560
and I was broke.

13:28.562 --> 13:30.562
So I guess I am your BFF--

13:30.564 --> 13:33.064
your broke friend forever.

13:33.066 --> 13:35.350
Max, it really doesn't matter
what you would've done.

13:35.352 --> 13:37.102
The only thing
I really wanted for my birthday

13:37.104 --> 13:38.486
was to see my father.

13:38.488 --> 13:41.556
And he's in prison,
so that didn't happen.

13:41.558 --> 13:44.826
I may not be a good BFF,

13:44.828 --> 13:46.111
I may not throw a great party,

13:46.113 --> 13:50.081
but I do know where
to find a free bus to prison.

13:50.083 --> 13:53.067
Hey, everybody.
We got a birthday girl onboard.

13:53.069 --> 13:56.171
Sit yo ass back down!

13:56.173 --> 13:59.591
See? Now we got a party.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.213
This is nice getting out of the city.

14:07.215 --> 14:09.463
Kind of reminds me
of the ride to the Hamptons.

14:09.465 --> 14:10.596
Yo.

14:10.598 --> 14:13.534
This your first time on the bangbus?

14:13.536 --> 14:18.249
We call it the bangbus because
everybody here gonna get banged.

14:18.251 --> 14:20.253
And in addition 'cause we're on a bus.

14:20.255 --> 14:21.615
Hmm, makes sense.

14:21.617 --> 14:22.934
Hey, I'm Shonda.

14:22.937 --> 14:24.686
I'm Max. This is Caroline.

14:24.688 --> 14:27.806
So you're all going for,
like, conjugal visits?

14:27.808 --> 14:29.169
Pretty fancy term for getting

14:29.171 --> 14:31.583
shawshanked on a three-legged cot.

14:31.585 --> 14:34.532
Shawshanked. I like her.

14:34.534 --> 14:35.485
I like your hair.

14:35.487 --> 14:38.095
Did you just get back from Cancun?

14:38.097 --> 14:39.465
No, no.

14:39.466 --> 14:41.321
I saved up,
and I got these done for my man.

14:41.323 --> 14:43.205
He says they make me

14:43.209 --> 14:45.056
look like Alicia Keys meets Ed Norton

14:45.058 --> 14:46.677
in <i>American History X.</i>

14:46.679 --> 14:47.979
How sweet.

14:47.981 --> 14:49.752
Ah, yo. What's your man in for?

14:49.754 --> 14:53.269
My man's in for possession
of a sweet, sweet ass.

14:53.271 --> 14:55.897
He makes that joke every time.

14:55.899 --> 14:58.607
He's not my man, actually. He's my dad.

14:58.609 --> 14:59.939
Oh, so you're a freak.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.825
That's all right. I don't judge.

15:01.827 --> 15:05.824
You see a name tag
on me that says "Judy"?

15:05.826 --> 15:07.510
Oh, look. We just passed a Carvel.

15:07.512 --> 15:09.284
What's a Carvel?

15:09.286 --> 15:11.038
Carvel ice cream.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.697
You know,
Fudgie the Whale, Cookie Puss.

15:12.699 --> 15:14.585
Come on, how could you not know Carvel?

15:14.587 --> 15:15.816
They have them everywhere.

15:15.818 --> 15:16.785
Oh, wait.

15:16.787 --> 15:18.696
Is that that white trash ice cream?

15:18.699 --> 15:20.011
How dare you!

15:20.013 --> 15:22.056
It is not white trash.

15:22.058 --> 15:23.485
And I wouldn't be so high and mighty.

15:23.487 --> 15:26.075
You're on a free bangbus to a prison.

15:26.078 --> 15:27.096
I'm sorry.

15:27.098 --> 15:28.272
I didn't realize you had such

15:28.274 --> 15:30.311
a strong emotional connection
to ice cream.

15:30.313 --> 15:34.494
Not to the ice cream. The ice cream cake.

15:34.496 --> 15:37.460
When I was ten, I asked my mom
for a birthday party.

15:37.463 --> 15:39.100
She said yes but then flaked out

15:39.102 --> 15:40.616
and forgot to call anyone.

15:40.619 --> 15:42.010
I'm starting to understand why

15:42.012 --> 15:43.584
you don't like birthday parties.

15:43.586 --> 15:45.705
So after I waited on the porch for an hour,

15:45.707 --> 15:47.160
I'll stole 20 bucks from her purse,

15:47.162 --> 15:48.494
thumbed it out to Carvel,

15:48.496 --> 15:49.966
and bought myself
a Fudgie the Whale cake.

15:49.968 --> 15:52.608
Ate the whole thing
with a pink plastic spoon,

15:52.610 --> 15:55.597
and it was way better than
any party ever could have been.

15:55.599 --> 15:57.112
I heard that.

15:57.114 --> 15:58.888
There ain't nothing better
than Fudgie the Whale.

15:58.890 --> 16:00.310
I love the chocolate crunchies.

16:00.311 --> 16:05.254
Bitch, everybody love
the damn chocolate crunchies!

16:08.628 --> 16:10.450
Hey, Shonda. Who are you here to see?

16:10.452 --> 16:12.485
Who's available?

16:12.487 --> 16:17.035
I'm just cracking wise.
You know I'm here to see Squirm.

16:17.037 --> 16:18.512
Search her.

16:18.514 --> 16:21.927
Damn. Is it my turn again?

16:21.929 --> 16:23.292
Next.

16:23.294 --> 16:25.605
We're not on that list. We didn't call ahead.

16:25.607 --> 16:27.205
Leave it to me.

16:27.207 --> 16:29.568
I've gotten into every club
I've ever wanted to get into.

16:29.570 --> 16:31.780
Hi. Caroline Channing plus one.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.701
I don't see you on the list.

16:33.703 --> 16:35.229
Really? That's weird.

16:35.231 --> 16:37.692
We should be on the list.
We're always on the list.

16:37.694 --> 16:39.038
Max, we're not on the list.

16:39.040 --> 16:44.478
We're not? I'm going to kill my assistant.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.171
Oh, I know.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.242
It might be under Deangelo Jefferson.

16:49.244 --> 16:51.344
Come on, girls. Don't waste my time.

16:51.346 --> 16:53.831
I'd like to see a manager.

16:56.079 --> 16:57.410
There's no manager.

16:57.412 --> 16:59.516
It's a prison.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.029
Well, then who runs this place?

17:02.031 --> 17:07.397
Well, the Aryan brotherhood
is getting pretty strong.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.583
This is such amateur hour.

17:09.585 --> 17:11.502
Give me 50 bucks for the door guy.

17:11.505 --> 17:13.522
Are you seriously trying to bribe

17:13.525 --> 17:17.217
an officer of the law
while inside a prison?

17:17.219 --> 17:19.070
That's a federal offense.

17:19.073 --> 17:21.021
Is it?

17:21.023 --> 17:23.747
Probably.

17:23.748 --> 17:25.872
Look, I should have you thrown
out for even suggesting it.

17:25.874 --> 17:27.501
We do not accept bribes.

17:27.502 --> 17:28.807
Okay, fine.

17:28.809 --> 17:30.989
I'll let you take
your sweet time searching me

17:30.991 --> 17:33.435
on the way in.

17:33.437 --> 17:35.644
These two are clear to go through.

17:35.646 --> 17:38.254
Max, you can't do that for me.

17:38.256 --> 17:40.636
It's really for me. It's been a while.

17:40.638 --> 17:43.989
Woot, woot.

17:45.102 --> 17:47.263
I'm so excited to see my father

17:47.265 --> 17:48.625
after all this time.

17:48.627 --> 17:50.087
How do I look?

17:50.089 --> 17:51.400
You look good. How do I look?

17:51.402 --> 17:54.225
Do I still have
that freshly felt-up glow?

17:54.227 --> 17:57.216
Well, that ginger over there
thinks you look good.

17:57.218 --> 17:59.045
He's full-on staring at you.

17:59.047 --> 18:00.972
Well, I should hope so.

18:00.974 --> 18:03.091
If you can't get a dude
in prison to check you out,

18:03.093 --> 18:05.328
it's time for a makeover.

18:05.330 --> 18:09.554
No, he's looking
and nodding like he knows you.

18:12.808 --> 18:14.517
Never seen him before in my life.

18:14.519 --> 18:15.831
Max?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.658
Max Black?

18:17.660 --> 18:19.670
It's me, Irish.

18:19.672 --> 18:21.930
I don't know, dude.
I think you got the wrong girl.

18:21.932 --> 18:24.074
Max, I could never forget that face.

18:24.076 --> 18:28.147
Trust me, you've never seen me before.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.924
Oh, damn!

18:29.926 --> 18:31.504
Oh, my God!

18:31.506 --> 18:33.166
That's you.

18:33.168 --> 18:34.795
So you do remember.

18:34.797 --> 18:36.290
Of course.

18:36.292 --> 18:39.282
Get rid of him.
It was a one-night stand.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.257
See, they do come back to haunt you.

18:41.259 --> 18:42.605
Shirt on.

18:42.608 --> 18:44.300
Max, can you believe it?

18:44.302 --> 18:46.046
Of all the prisons in all the world,

18:46.048 --> 18:47.391
you walked into mine.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.703
It's kismet.

18:48.705 --> 18:51.447
I got rid of yours. You get rid of mine.

18:51.449 --> 18:54.389
Listen, Irish. It was a one-time thing.

18:54.391 --> 18:56.100
You're a guy. You get that.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.094
How could you say it's a one-time thing?

18:58.096 --> 18:59.458
I love you.

18:59.460 --> 19:02.864
I blew up that chipotle for you.

19:02.866 --> 19:04.875
Listen, I appreciate the ink,

19:04.877 --> 19:06.653
but I don't really believe in love,

19:06.655 --> 19:07.982
and truth be told,

19:07.985 --> 19:10.110
I'm not even a fan of Mexican food.

19:10.112 --> 19:12.304
Caroline Channing. This table.

19:12.306 --> 19:14.166
Max, we have to go. My dad's coming.

19:14.168 --> 19:15.828
Okay. Nice to see you, Irish.

19:15.830 --> 19:17.540
Your body looks sick.

19:17.542 --> 19:18.851
Max, hold on.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.512
I'm not going to tell you again to back up.

19:20.515 --> 19:21.993
Max, I'm not going to lose you twice.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.397
I said, back up!

19:23.399 --> 19:24.652
Don't tell me to back up.

19:24.654 --> 19:26.014
That's the love of my life.

19:26.016 --> 19:27.462
Come on, dude. Hit the pike.

19:27.463 --> 19:28.897
Calm down.

19:28.842 --> 19:30.045
Don't tell me to calm down!

19:34.342 --> 19:36.336
Visiting hours are over! Everybody out!

19:36.338 --> 19:38.280
No, no, no, wait! I can't leave.

19:38.283 --> 19:41.092
Damn!

19:41.094 --> 19:42.621
Oh, wait. There's my father.

19:42.623 --> 19:44.050
I can see him, he's just coming in.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.182
Oh, daddy. Daddy...
Hi!

19:47.923 --> 19:50.083
Well, thank you very much, ladies.

19:50.085 --> 19:53.356
My man was barely in
when I got pulled out.

19:53.358 --> 19:57.030
I would like to apologize to everyone

19:57.032 --> 19:59.673
for taking the bang out of the bus,

19:59.675 --> 20:01.550
but in my own defense,

20:01.552 --> 20:04.224
everyone here knows a little
something about crazy guys.

20:04.226 --> 20:06.734
Sit yo ass back down!

20:06.736 --> 20:09.260
Max, sit down before you start another riot.

20:09.262 --> 20:10.872
I'm sorry. I blew it.

20:10.874 --> 20:12.666
I screwed up your chance
to see your father.

20:12.668 --> 20:14.014
I screwed up your party.

20:14.016 --> 20:16.522
I even screwed up the
easiest birthday thing to do,

20:16.524 --> 20:17.869
like get a cake.

20:17.871 --> 20:19.679
I'm a terrible BFF.

20:19.681 --> 20:21.093
It's okay.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.740
Really, it's fine.

20:22.742 --> 20:24.100
With the year I'm having,

20:24.102 --> 20:26.093
it's not like you could've
made everything better

20:26.096 --> 20:27.442
just by getting me a cake.

20:27.444 --> 20:31.228
Well, no. Not just any cake.

20:34.507 --> 20:36.399
Just as good as I remember it.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.076
Best 40 bucks we ever spent.

20:39.078 --> 20:41.269
And this birthday turned out
to be all right.

20:41.271 --> 20:42.985
I did get what I wanted.

20:42.987 --> 20:44.378
I got see my father.

20:44.381 --> 20:46.937
It was only for a second,
but I saw him.

20:46.939 --> 20:49.315
And he saw me. So thank you.

20:49.317 --> 20:52.522
Yeah, and I got to see Irish.

20:52.524 --> 20:55.081
Think he might be
the one that got away.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.175
Well, the one that got put away.

20:57.177 --> 20:59.420
You know, you and I are better than BFFs.

20:59.422 --> 21:01.114
We're BBFs.

21:01.116 --> 21:04.902
Bangbus friends.
