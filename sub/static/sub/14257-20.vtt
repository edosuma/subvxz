DEFEAT ME, THEN, ATTACK.

01:23.157 --> 01:26.600
WE SHALL SEE HOW WELL
THE PUPILS HAVE LEARNED
THEIR LESSONS.

01:26.601 --> 01:28.974
YOU GOT TO ADMIRE
HIS ENTHUSIASM.

01:28.975 --> 01:30.613
YEAH. LET'S DO IT.

01:33.288 --> 01:35.628
COWABUNGA!

01:40.009 --> 01:42.549
NOT ONE OF YOU
BROKE THROUGH MY DEFENSE.

01:42.550 --> 01:44.455
WHAT IS YOUR EXCUSE,
STUDENTS?

01:44.456 --> 01:48.033
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN FEELING
KIND OF DOWN LATELY.

01:48.034 --> 01:50.407
AND I'VE BEEN FEELING
BOXED IN.

01:50.408 --> 01:52.713
NOW THAT YOU
PIN US DOWN TO IT,

01:52.714 --> 01:56.425
I THINK WE NEED
A VACATION, MASTER.

01:56.426 --> 01:57.929
A VACATION?

01:57.930 --> 01:59.434
FOR SURE,

01:59.435 --> 02:02.343
WE'RE TOTALLY
TUCKERED OUT TURTLES.

02:02.344 --> 02:05.118
HMM, YOUR LACK
OF FIGHTING SKILLS

02:05.119 --> 02:06.556
HAS CONVINCED ME.

02:06.557 --> 02:08.830
PERHAPS YOU DO NEED
A VACATION.

02:08.830 --> 02:10.368
ALL RIGHT!

02:10.369 --> 02:13.745
MALIBU BEACH,
HERE WE COME!

02:13.746 --> 02:16.921
UH-UH,
THE SMITHSONIAN
MUSEUM.

02:16.922 --> 02:19.428
I SAY
THE WAR MUSEUM.

02:19.429 --> 02:21.835
LAS VEGAS IS
WHERE THE ACTION IS.

02:21.836 --> 02:23.441
LAS VEGAS?

02:23.442 --> 02:24.511
YEAH, COME ON!

02:25.682 --> 02:27.620
YOU MAY HAVE
YOUR VACATION...

02:27.621 --> 02:29.860
IF YOU CAN AGREE
ON WHERE TO SPEND IT.

02:29.861 --> 02:32.368
I KNEW THERE WAS
A CATCH TO IT.

02:59.319 --> 03:00.822
AFTERNOON, MA'AM.

03:00.823 --> 03:04.099
LOVELY DAY TO SIT
IN THE PARK, ISN'T IT?

03:04.100 --> 03:06.172
IT CERTAINLY IS,
OFFICER.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.890
SO THIS
IS PLANET EARTH.

03:22.891 --> 03:25.631
HMM. NOW, LET'S SEE
WHAT THE TRAVEL GUIDE

03:25.632 --> 03:28.440
HAS TO SAY ABOUT
THIS STRANGE PLACE.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.981
"DON'T DRINK
THE H2O."

03:30.982 --> 03:31.984
YES.

03:31.985 --> 03:34.425
"TIP ALL WAITERS 15%

03:34.426 --> 03:37.668

03:37.669 --> 03:40.075
OH, HELLO, THERE.

03:40.076 --> 03:43.051

A CUTE PET YOU HAVE.

YOU ARE.

03:51.044 --> 03:54.821
OH, MY. AN EARTHLING
AUTHORITY FIGURE.

03:54.822 --> 03:59.602
WAIT TILL THE FOLKS
BACK ON POLARIS
SEE THIS ONE.

03:59.603 --> 04:01.609
THEY'LL NEVER
BELIEVE IT.

04:14.549 --> 04:17.255
OOH, SO MANY
PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.035

PLENTY OF VIDEOTAPE.

04:22.105 --> 04:24.478

BUSINESS CALLS TO MAKE.

04:41.732 --> 04:43.871
I'M TRYING,
MR. THOMPSON,

04:43.872 --> 04:46.747
BUT PEOPLE'S THINGS
KEEP ON DISAPPEARING.

04:46.748 --> 04:48.418
DO IT! DO IT!
DO IT!

04:48.419 --> 04:51.728
OR THE NEXT THING
THAT DISAPPEARS
WILL BE YOUR JOB.

04:51.729 --> 04:53.467
GOOD GOING, IRMA.

04:53.468 --> 04:56.743

THE OLD MAN OFF.

04:56.744 --> 04:59.117

05:02.630 --> 05:04.835
CITY HALL

05:04.836 --> 05:07.877
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF WISE GUY?

05:09.083 --> 05:11.589
YES, MR. MAYOR.

05:11.590 --> 05:13.160
RIGHT AWAY, MR. MAYOR.

05:13.161 --> 05:15.769
UH...WRONG NUMBER.

05:17.174 --> 05:20.584
DID YOU HEAR THAT, IRMA?
CITY HALL IS MISSING.

05:20.585 --> 05:23.559
NOW, THIS SOUNDS
LIKE A BIG STORY.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.532
APRIL! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

05:25.533 --> 05:27.773
TO TAKE SOME PICTURES

05:27.774 --> 05:30.112
WHILE THERE'S SOMETHING
TO TAKE PICTURES OF.

05:31.351 --> 05:32.821
<i>Man, on TV: NUMEROUS
TOURIST ATTRACTIONS</i>

05:32.822 --> 05:34.459

05:42.752 --> 05:44.256
VANISHING
TOURIST ATTRACTIONS

05:44.257 --> 05:47.199
CAN ONLY MEAN
ONE THING--

05:47.200 --> 05:50.474
A VISIT BY
THE POLARISOIDS.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.247
THE POLARISOIDS?

05:52.248 --> 05:55.223
THE MOST
OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS

05:55.224 --> 05:57.396
IN THE ENTIRE GALAXY.

05:57.397 --> 05:59.201
THEY HAVE CAMERAS

05:59.202 --> 06:02.913
THAT DON'T
JUST TAKE PICTURES
OF THEIR VACATIONS,

06:02.914 --> 06:05.487
IT TAKES
THEIR ENTIRE VACATIONS

06:05.488 --> 06:07.996
BACK WITH THEM
TO POLARIS.

06:07.997 --> 06:12.008
HMM, WE MIGHT MAKE USE
OF THEIR VISIT, KRANG.

06:12.009 --> 06:13.512
MEANING WHAT?

06:13.513 --> 06:16.321
MEANING WITH
A POLARISOID CAMERA,

06:16.322 --> 06:20.199
WE COULD CAPTURE
THE TURTLES
IN A FLASH.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.008
OOH, EXCELLENT IDEA.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.948
I'M GLAD I THOUGHT OF IT.

06:24.949 --> 06:29.628
FIND THE POLARISOID
AND BRING ME THAT CAMERA.

06:29.629 --> 06:32.705
ROCK STEADY, BEBOP,
COME WITH ME.

06:32.706 --> 06:35.780
WE'RE GOING
POLARISOID HUNTING.

06:44.441 --> 06:46.613
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.118
THERE'S NO STORY HERE.

06:48.119 --> 06:50.225
THOSE PEOPLE LOOK JUST
LIKE ORDINARY TOURISTS.

06:53.368 --> 06:56.176
OH, POOR,
TIMID EARTHLINGS.

06:56.177 --> 06:58.282
THEY MUST BE
CAMERA SHY.

06:58.283 --> 07:01.927
WOW! TALK ABOUT
SOMEBODY
FROM OUT OF TOWN.

07:01.928 --> 07:03.633
I WONDER IF THERE'S
ANY CONNECTION

07:03.634 --> 07:06.107
BETWEEN THAT ALIEN
AND THINGS
DISAPPEARING.

07:06.108 --> 07:11.089
HMM, THE NEBULANS MUST
BE FREQUENT VISITORS
TO THIS PLANET.

07:11.090 --> 07:13.931
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY PUT UP
A STATUE OF ONE?

07:15.804 --> 07:19.414
HOT DOGS! GET
YOUR HOT DOGS HERE!

07:19.415 --> 07:21.086
GET 'EM WHILE
THEY'RE RED HOT!

07:21.087 --> 07:24.395
OH, NO! IT'S SHREDDER!

07:24.396 --> 07:27.171
I'D BETTER LET THE TURTLES
KNOW ABOUT THIS.

07:27.172 --> 07:29.578
APRIL TO TURTLES.
COME IN, TURTLES.

07:32.288 --> 07:35.463
I STILL SAY WE OUGHT
TO SPEND OUR VACATION

07:35.464 --> 07:37.035
SOAKING UP CULTURE.

07:37.036 --> 07:40.646
OH, I'D RATHER SOAK
UP SOME RAYS
AT MALIBU.

07:40.647 --> 07:44.156
COME IN, TURTLES!
IT'S AN EMERGENCY!

07:44.157 --> 07:45.995
YES, APRIL, WHAT IS IT?

07:45.996 --> 07:47.868
YOU'LL LIKE THIS.

07:47.869 --> 07:50.910
IT'S A TYPICAL
EARTH NOSH.

07:50.911 --> 07:53.852
OOH, YES,
IT IS RATHER TASTY.

07:53.853 --> 07:56.026
I'M AT FOUNTAIN SQUARE,

07:56.027 --> 07:57.664
AND SO IS SHREDDER! HURRY!

07:57.665 --> 08:00.774
DID YOU SAY SHREDDER?
WE'RE ON OUR WAY!

08:03.684 --> 08:06.559
SAY, WHY DON'T I TAKE
A PICTURE OF YOU

08:06.560 --> 08:09.868
POSING WITH A COUPLE
OF TYPICAL EARTHLINGS?

08:09.869 --> 08:13.178
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE
A FEW HANDY.

08:13.179 --> 08:14.683
HI, THERE.

08:14.684 --> 08:16.489
WELCOME TO OUR
FRIENDLY PLANET.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.461
OOH, GOOD IDEA.

08:18.462 --> 08:22.908
I NEVER GET PICTURES
OF MYSELF ON VACATION.

08:22.909 --> 08:25.717
WAIT TILL THE FOLKS
BACK HOME SEE THIS ONE.

08:25.718 --> 08:28.492
THEY'LL BE PINK
WITH ENVY.

08:28.493 --> 08:29.963
SAY CHEESE.

08:29.964 --> 08:31.769
CHEESE!

08:35.147 --> 08:36.650
EVERYONE DISAPPEARED!

08:36.652 --> 08:38.422
SO THAT'S
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

08:38.423 --> 08:39.525
TO THE BUILDINGS.

08:39.527 --> 08:41.466
THE CAMERA WORKS!

08:41.467 --> 08:45.176
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FIND
THOSE BLASTED TURTLES.

08:47.385 --> 08:50.559
AH, MY WISH IS GRANTED.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.800
SURRENDER, SHREDDER.

08:52.801 --> 08:55.475
YEAH, DUDE.
YOU'RE OUTNUMBERED.

08:55.476 --> 08:56.578
GET THE PICTURE?

08:56.579 --> 08:59.687
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I INTEND TO DO.

09:05.641 --> 09:09.317
SMILE, TURTLES,
YOU'RE ON
VANISHING CAMERA.

09:09.318 --> 09:12.126
I'VE GOT TO
DO SOMETHING.

09:16.105 --> 09:18.612
I GIVE HIM A 4.8
ON THAT DIVE.

09:18.613 --> 09:20.719
EVERYBODY INTO THE POOL!

09:21.723 --> 09:24.363
<i>SURF'S UP, COMPADRES!</i>

09:26.638 --> 09:29.814

09:29.815 --> 09:33.258

09:33.259 --> 09:35.197
WHAT INCSO, YOU WANTAGE
FOR WATER GAMES, HUH?

09:35.198 --> 09:38.038
TAKE THIS, YOU
WRETCHED REPTILES.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.789
TRY AGAIN, CREEPOLA!

09:45.295 --> 09:47.701
YOU'RE ALL WASHED UP,

09:47.702 --> 09:49.139
NOT QUITE.

09:52.985 --> 09:54.756
<i>AU REVOIR, MUTANTS,</i>

09:54.757 --> 09:57.732
TILL WE MEET AGAIN.

09:57.733 --> 10:00.674
AHA!
THE ALIEN CAMERA.

10:00.675 --> 10:03.182
GIVE IT UP, SHREDDER.
SURRENDER!

10:03.183 --> 10:04.519
NOT ON YOUR LIFE.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.462
I PREFER TO CAPTURE
THE MOMENT FOREVER.

10:08.967 --> 10:11.541
BLAST! IT MUST BE
OUT OF VIDEOTAPE!

10:11.542 --> 10:13.814
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
OVEREXPOSED YOURSELF,

10:13.815 --> 10:14.817
RUSTBRAIN.

10:14.818 --> 10:17.326
YEAH. WHY NOT COME ALONG
PEACEFULLY?

10:17.327 --> 10:21.171
AS USUAL, I HAVE
A BETTER IDEA.

10:22.777 --> 10:24.648
I CAN'T SEE!

10:26.120 --> 10:27.691
HE'S GONE.

10:27.692 --> 10:28.827
BUMMER, DUDES.

10:28.828 --> 10:32.338
I HATE PEOPLE
WHO SMOKE AND RUN.

10:32.339 --> 10:34.879
SHREDDER'S GOT
THAT ALIEN CAMERA!

10:34.880 --> 10:37.788
AND ALL THOSE
FAMOUS LANDMARKS
ARE TRAPPED INSIDE IT!

10:37.789 --> 10:40.296
GREAT. MAYBE HE'LL TAKE
A SELF-PORTRAIT.

10:40.297 --> 10:42.368
AT LEAST HE LEFT ME
MY OWN CAMERA.

10:42.369 --> 10:45.144
SO IT SHOULDN'T
BEAUTIFUL TOTAL
WASTE, FELLAS.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.983
HOW ABOUT
AN INTERVIEW
WITH THE TURTLES?

10:48.489 --> 10:49.491
SORRY, APRIL.

10:49.492 --> 10:51.396
YEAH, THEY'RE PLAYING
OUR SONG.

10:51.397 --> 10:53.937
WHOA, TIME FOR US TO BOOGIE.

10:57.450 --> 11:00.993
I BETTER GET THIS
VIDEOTAPE TO CHANNEL 6.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.333
I WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT BACK THE TURTLES

11:03.334 --> 11:05.071

11:05.072 --> 11:08.148

REMEMBER THEM
ALWAYS THAT WAY.

13:02.733 --> 13:06.410
THE HECK IT WAS! THAT WAS
THE ALIEN'S VIDEO!

13:06.411 --> 13:09.486
WHICH MEANS
THAT APRIL'S
GOT HIS CAMERA!

13:09.487 --> 13:12.763
TURTLES, YOU MUST RECOVER
THAT ALIEN CAMERA

13:12.764 --> 13:15.505
BEFORE SHREDDER DISCOVERS
WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

13:15.506 --> 13:16.943
YOU'RE RIGHT,
MASTER.

13:16.944 --> 13:19.584
LET'S GO,
FELLAS!

13:19.585 --> 13:21.356
THEY HAVE MUCH COURAGE,

13:21.357 --> 13:23.930
BUT NOT THE BEST
OF TABLE MANNERS.

13:28.011 --> 13:30.216
WELL, VERNON,
WHAT DID YOU
THINK OF MY TAPE?

13:30.217 --> 13:33.493
OLD TV HORROR SHOWS
ARE NOT NEWS, APRIL.

13:33.494 --> 13:35.499
OLD TV HORROR SHOWS?

13:35.500 --> 13:37.538
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:38.744 --> 13:40.013
WHAT?

13:40.014 --> 13:43.023
HEY, WHO TURNED ON
THE LIGHT?

13:43.024 --> 13:44.059
SHREDDER!

13:44.060 --> 13:46.433
I HAVE COME
FOR MY CAMERA.

13:48.172 --> 13:50.244
NOW, BE GOOD ENOUGH
TO HAND IT OVER.

13:50.245 --> 13:53.554
YOUR CAMERA?
THIS IS MY CAMERA!

13:53.555 --> 13:56.229
I SAID HAND IT OVER!

13:56.230 --> 13:57.867
MY TIME IS VALUABLE!

14:00.644 --> 14:02.081
WHAT'S THAT?

14:02.082 --> 14:06.159
IT'S A GREAT BIG DOG, DUDE.
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

14:08.669 --> 14:10.741
OH, I COULD DO
A BIRDIE, TOO.

14:10.742 --> 14:12.847
WANNA SEE? HERE--
TWEET, TWEET!

14:14.687 --> 14:17.026
IDIOTIC
SHADOW TRICKS!

14:17.027 --> 14:20.404
TURTLES,
FIGHT WITH HONOR!

14:27.727 --> 14:30.400
ROLL CAMERAS! HA HA!

14:30.401 --> 14:33.176
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY THAT.

14:33.177 --> 14:34.580
WHAT?
WHAT?

14:37.088 --> 14:38.993
YOU'D BETTER
SURRENDER, SHREDDER.

14:38.994 --> 14:43.073
YOU CAN'T STOP
ALL FOUR OF US.
RIGHT, TURTLES?

14:43.074 --> 14:44.778
RIGHT.
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

14:44.779 --> 14:48.423
WHAT ACTION!
I'VE GOT TO GET
THIS ON TAPE!

14:48.424 --> 14:52.000
APRIL, DON'T USE
THAT CAMERA!

14:52.001 --> 14:53.706
DON'T!

15:01.764 --> 15:03.268
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:03.269 --> 15:05.308
THEY ALL
JUST DISAPPEARED.

15:05.309 --> 15:08.484
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRITTEN ON THIS THING.

15:08.485 --> 15:10.490
"MADE IN
ALPHA CENTAURI"?

15:10.491 --> 15:12.329
IT'S THE ALIEN CAMERA!

15:12.330 --> 15:14.000
APRIL CALLING SPLINTER!

15:14.001 --> 15:17.010
COME IN, SPLINTER!
OH, PLEASE COME IN!

15:24.300 --> 15:26.272
MOST EXCELLENT
RIDE, DUDES.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.478
WHERE ARE WE?
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

15:28.479 --> 15:30.987
I HATE TO SAY IT,

15:30.988 --> 15:33.226
BUT WE'RE
INSIDE THE CAMERA.

15:33.227 --> 15:36.403
OH, SWELL.
WE'VE BEEN SHUTTER MUGGED.

15:36.404 --> 15:38.509
<i>ADIOS, REPTILES!</i>

15:38.510 --> 15:41.385
SHREDDER'S
GETTING AWAY!
AFTER HIM!

15:46.134 --> 15:49.777
THIS DUDE TOOK PICTURES
OF EVERYTHING!

15:49.778 --> 15:51.884
SHRED-HEAD
OVERBOARD!

15:55.495 --> 15:57.702
TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE.

16:01.548 --> 16:03.553
WAY TO GO,
DONATELLO!

16:03.554 --> 16:05.124
I'LL BET YOU PITCH

16:05.125 --> 16:07.766
A RADICAL ROUND
OF HORSE SHOES.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.039
WE'VE GOT YOU
THIS TIME, SHREDDER.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.045
THERE'S
NO WAY OUT.

16:12.046 --> 16:14.252
HERE, BOSS!
GRAB HOLD OF THIS!

16:15.791 --> 16:19.802
FAREWELL, MUTANTS.
OR HAVE I ALREADY
SAID THAT?

16:19.803 --> 16:21.140
AFTER HIM, GUYS!

16:21.141 --> 16:25.486
WHAT GOES UP--
WELL, YOU KNOW

16:34.214 --> 16:36.320
THIS GUY SURE TOOK
SOME WEIRD PHOTOS.

16:36.321 --> 16:37.825
YOU OK, DONATELLO?

16:37.826 --> 16:40.332
YOU LOOK
KIND OF WEIRD.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.602
YEAH, I'M OK.

16:41.603 --> 16:45.849
SEEING THAT MANHOLE
JUST MADE ME
KIND OF HOMESICK.

16:48.893 --> 16:52.134
GREETINGS,
PRIMITIVE LIFE FORMS!

16:52.135 --> 16:54.074
HE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

16:54.075 --> 16:55.478
LISTEN MISTER,

16:55.479 --> 16:57.217
YOU'VE GOT TO LET
ALL YOUR PICTURES

16:57.218 --> 16:59.323
RETURN
TO THE REAL WORLD.

16:59.324 --> 17:02.332
YOU'VE GOT
INNOCENT PEOPLE
TRAPPED IN HERE.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.470
NOT TO MENTION
INNOCENT
TURTLES.

17:03.471 --> 17:05.809
BUT I'M A TOURIST.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.816
I'M SUPPOSED
TO TAKE PICTURES.

17:09.622 --> 17:11.426
A SUBWAY TRAIN!

17:11.428 --> 17:14.202
OH, IS THAT WHAT
THAT THING IS?

17:16.544 --> 17:18.983
BETTER MAKE TRACKS,
DUDES!

17:27.712 --> 17:32.424
I WISH I HADN'T EATEN
THAT PIZZA BEFORE WE LEFT.

17:38.912 --> 17:40.751
STOP! STOP, I SAY!

17:40.752 --> 17:43.258
YOU'RE EXCEEDING
THE SPEED LIMIT!

17:45.132 --> 17:47.772
COWABUNGA!

17:55.463 --> 17:58.972
OH, NO. WE'RE BACK
IN THE SUBWAY.

17:58.973 --> 18:01.948
LET ME OFF
AT THE 39th PRECINCT,
WILL YOU?

18:01.949 --> 18:04.824
IT'S SHREDDER
AND THE TWO
DEAD HEADS.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.943
UH-OH. WE'RE
GOING TO CRASH!

18:17.598 --> 18:21.575
THANKS FOR THE LIFT.
I'LL WALK THE REST
OF THE WAY.

18:27.929 --> 18:31.806
WHOA! YOU CAN SEE
THE OCEAN FROM HERE!

18:31.807 --> 18:33.311
THAT'S A THRILL
AND A HALF.

18:36.021 --> 18:38.661
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, APRIL?
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES?

18:38.662 --> 18:40.098
I DON'T KNOW.

18:40.099 --> 18:43.041
I JUST TOOK
THEIR PICTURE
WITH THIS CAMERA,

18:43.042 --> 18:44.713
AND POOF!
THEY DISAPPEARED.

18:44.714 --> 18:46.652
WE HAVE ONE CHANCE.

18:46.653 --> 18:48.592
QUICKLY,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

18:52.070 --> 18:54.576
WELL, AT LEAST
WE GAVE SHREDDER THE SLIP.

18:54.577 --> 18:58.087
I WOULDN'T
BE SO SURE.

18:58.088 --> 19:00.094
GIVE MY REGARDS
TO BROADWAY

19:00.095 --> 19:02.033
WHEN YOU HIT IT.

19:10.058 --> 19:14.537
DID YOU TAKE A PICTURE
OF A PIZZA PARLOR?

19:14.538 --> 19:16.443
I'VE GOT A MAJOR CASE
OF THE MUNCHIES.

19:16.444 --> 19:19.118
GIVE UP, TURTLES.
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE.

19:19.119 --> 19:21.058
WHY FIGHT, SHREDDER?

19:21.059 --> 19:24.067
YOU'RE TRAPPED
INSIDE THE CAMERA
JUST LIKE US.

19:24.068 --> 19:28.915
OUR ENTIRE UNIVERSE
IS JUST A VIDEO
CASSETTE.

19:28.916 --> 19:30.854
ATTACK!

19:30.855 --> 19:32.693
WITH PLEASURE, BOSS.

19:34.633 --> 19:37.240
I KNOW. YOU VISITED
THE WAR MUSEUM.

19:37.241 --> 19:39.982
HEY, IT WAS
FREE ADMISSION.

19:46.503 --> 19:48.709
THIS IS WHERE
WE EDIT ALL OUR TAPES.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.848
I PRAY
WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.299
I MUST
TRY SOMETHING.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.405
STAND BACK, APRIL.

20:17.197 --> 20:21.208
MASTER SPLINTER,
AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

20:21.209 --> 20:22.345
WHERE IS
MICHELANGELO?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.352
SURF'S UP!

20:24.353 --> 20:26.223
COWABUNGA!

20:33.848 --> 20:37.725
MAYBE FROM NOW ON
I'LL JUST BUY
PICTURE POSTCARDS.

20:37.726 --> 20:40.066
AN EXCELLENT IDEA,
MY FRIEND.

20:40.067 --> 20:43.643
OH, APRIL!

20:43.644 --> 20:45.650
UH-OH! IT'S MY BOSS!

20:45.651 --> 20:47.723
QUICKLY, TURTLES!
THIS WAY!

20:50.533 --> 20:53.574
APRIL, WHAT
IS GOING ON HERE?

20:53.575 --> 20:56.951
CHIEF, YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME IF I TOLD YA.

21:00.095 --> 21:02.902
I TRUST YOU ENJOYED
YOUR VACATION
ON OUR PLANET?

21:02.903 --> 21:06.179
WELL, EARTH MAY BE
A NICE PLACE TO LIVE,

21:06.180 --> 21:08.820
BUT I SURE WOULDN'T
WANT TO VISIT HERE.

21:19.087 --> 21:20.590
SPEAKING OF VACATIONS,

21:20.591 --> 21:23.265
HAVE YOU TURTLES DECIDED
WHERE YOU WISH TO GO?

21:23.266 --> 21:26.040
ACTUALLY, I THINK
WE'VE DECIDED

21:26.041 --> 21:28.614
THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE HOME, MASTER.

21:28.615 --> 21:31.290
YEAH. THAT SEWER'S STARTING
TO LOOK REALLY INVITING.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.296
EXACTAMUNDO!

21:33.297 --> 21:36.673
LIKE, WHO NEEDS
TOURISTS ANYWAY?
