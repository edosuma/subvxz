02:14.342 --> 02:15.426

02:15.510 --> 02:19.639
It should, but since I don't understand
exactly what it's doing, I can't be sure.

-Oh, not alone. We should do it together.

What happened was awful.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.625
But it isn't his fault.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.212
He shouldn't blame himself
for his father's death.

02:52.922 --> 02:53.840
What's hard for Will

02:53.965 --> 02:57.552
is that all the things
that were broken between them...

02:58.678 --> 03:00.597

It's much more intense
than when I visit with any of you.

It's more physical.

03:34.631 --> 03:38.635

It's a pleasure. It's an honor.

-He's Pablo?
-He's Pablo?

24:18.540 --> 24:19.457
I am.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.042
The deal was inked yesterday.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.586
We're...

24:24.671 --> 24:26.590
That's right, kid.
In your Hollywood debut,

24:26.673 --> 24:27.966
you will be falling in love

24:28.049 --> 24:30.010
with three-time
Academy Award-winning actor

24:30.093 --> 24:31.511
Blake Huntington.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.347
Why do you care so much
about those things?

24:34.431 --> 24:36.474
I'm guessing he already told you
what he did with his.

24:37.517 --> 24:38.560
Of course I did.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.730
Mr. Huntington,
we're huge fans of your work.

24:41.813 --> 24:42.939
Huge. Like--

24:43.023 --> 24:46.109
Like The Glass Blower
is a postmodern masterpiece.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.778
I teach it to my university students
back home.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.198
Thank you. Thank you, that's very kind.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.700

don't embarrass the man.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.702

24:56.203 --> 24:57.913
-She's my agent.
-Oh.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.247
Daniela Velázquez.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.917
But you can call me Dani.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.043
Nice to meet you.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.921
And he's my boyfriend, Hernando Fuentes.

25:06.004 --> 25:09.507
Oh, yeah, from your, uh, São Paulo speech.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.551
You watched the speech?

25:12.135 --> 25:13.845
I did. And when I heard
you were meeting for this,

25:13.929 --> 25:15.680
I also screened The Passion of the Sinner.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.266
Really?

25:19.684 --> 25:21.144
Yeah, I enjoyed it immensely.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.272
I thought it offered real insight
on the interdependence of identity

25:24.356 --> 25:27.234
by rejecting the standard male narratives
of sovereignty.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.444
I've said the same thing.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.741
"And he judged of others by himself,
not believing in what he saw,

25:34.824 --> 25:38.161
but was convinced that every man
had his real, most interesting life...

25:38.245 --> 25:41.164
...under the cover of secrecy
and the dark of night."

25:42.123 --> 25:43.166
The Lady and the Dog.

I thought if you were going

33:57.076 --> 33:58.911
you should know a few things about me.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.125
Once, a Kikuyu woman...

34:05.501 --> 34:07.503
and a Luo man
fell in love with each other.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.507
They were urged by both of their families

34:11.591 --> 34:14.552
not to marry outside the tribal boundary,
but...

34:16.637 --> 34:22.226
love is a bridge and not a wall,
if we let it be.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.730
They became husband and wife.

34:27.356 --> 34:30.068
At first, they lived
with my father's family in Ahero,

34:30.151 --> 34:34.530
but I'm afraid the Luo village found
a hundred ways to make the new bride

34:34.614 --> 34:36.240
feel as if she was a trespasser.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.826
So, when I was only a few months old,

34:39.535 --> 34:42.205
my parents went to live in the village
that my mother was born.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.334
Now it was my father's turn to be made
to feel like he was an outsider

34:46.417 --> 34:47.335
who did not belong.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.129
My parents had to leave their homes...

34:51.297 --> 34:53.132
to find a city where no one knew them.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.969
The same prejudice that drove them away...

34:58.596 --> 35:01.140
was also responsible
for taking my father's life

35:01.224 --> 35:03.726
when a political difference
became a tribal war.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.611
I share this story because
you have heard many rumors about me...

35:15.822 --> 35:18.574

we'll rip your hands off at the wrist.

42:33.968 --> 42:39.598
Meaning, I've got plans, Van Damn.
Big plans.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.189
Now get the fuck out of my new car.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.867
Capheus! Ohh!

42:58.951 --> 43:00.744
It's okay, Mama. It's okay.

43:01.620 --> 43:04.290
-Oh, I was so scared.
-It's okay. I'm okay.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.833
Ow!

43:05.916 --> 43:08.877
Oh, my God. What happened?

43:08.961 --> 43:10.129
I'm okay. I'm okay.

43:16.385 --> 43:20.681
What you said on that stage
was good for people to hear.

43:22.057 --> 43:24.101
You were amazing.

43:25.894 --> 43:28.188
I want to grow up so I can vote for you.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.732
[laughter]

43:29.815 --> 43:31.275
After what happened...

43:33.193 --> 43:35.112
I don't think anyone's
going to vote for me.

43:36.280 --> 43:39.617
I wouldn't be so sure, Capheus.
People heard you out there.

43:39.700 --> 43:43.329
And they know the violence was caused
by Mandiba's men.

43:43.412 --> 43:47.875
He's right. Before those demonstrators,
you could feel the excitement.

43:47.958 --> 43:51.211
-It was more than just excitement.
-They loved what you said.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.797
They did. And I did, too.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.967
I think everyone at the park
felt the exact same thing.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.595
That there was a chance,
maybe even a last chance,

43:59.678 --> 44:02.097
for a future that doesn't look
exactly like our past.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.933
Yeah. That's true.

44:55.025 --> 44:56.485
Tonight's the gala.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.867
Will you try to stop me?

45:04.701 --> 45:06.370
Do you want me to stop you?

45:12.459 --> 45:15.421
Every cop knows there are times
where the only choice you have left...

45:16.672 --> 45:18.298
is to defend yourself.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.691
I missed my cop.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.777
He missed you.

46:36.376 --> 46:37.628
Welcome home.

47:35.352 --> 47:37.479
[applause]

48:07.676 --> 48:09.678
The security is very perimeter-based.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.098
If Sun's right,
he gives some kind of address,

48:13.181 --> 48:14.516
we should make our move just after that.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.978
How do we get him out of the building?

48:18.604 --> 48:20.314
Looks like the garage
is our only viable exit.

48:20.397 --> 48:21.356
Got it.

48:21.440 --> 48:24.443
-[Nomi] We need building schematics.
-[Bug] On it.

48:24.526 --> 48:26.987
-And then?
-We get him to tell the truth.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.823
A coerced confession
isn't admissible evidence.

48:29.906 --> 48:31.116
We trick him.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.869
What if we can't get him
out of the building?

48:35.912 --> 48:38.624
He'll keep coming after her,
because as long as she's alive,

48:38.707 --> 48:39.958
someone will know what he has done.

48:40.834 --> 48:41.752
One way or another...

48:44.463 --> 48:45.464
we end it.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.473
We take everything that matters...

48:55.932 --> 48:57.643
we push all of it into this...

49:06.151 --> 49:07.569
and we fight for it.
