01:15.992 --> 01:19.826
I remember you as a noisy little
fellow, son. All of a sudden, you get quiet.

01:19.896 --> 01:22.956
Is your book of answers lost,
or are you waiting for your lawyer?

01:23.032 --> 01:25.500
Maybe you don't think
murder looks good on you.

01:25.568 --> 01:28.162
- Maybe I didn't do it.
- Maybe he didn't do it.

01:28.238 --> 01:30.672
Look, Marlowe, we're arraigning you.

01:30.740 --> 01:33.231
We don't like you, but it ain't personal.

01:33.309 --> 01:35.470
We just follow a routine after a killing.

01:35.545 --> 01:36.637
Where's Randall?

01:36.713 --> 01:38.977
He asked us to talk to you, if that's okay.

01:39.048 --> 01:41.380
- Is he holding the kid?
- I wouldn't know.

01:41.451 --> 01:43.817
- Is she all right?
- I wouldn't know that either.

01:43.887 --> 01:46.253
- Where did you see her last?
- I forget.

01:56.933 --> 02:00.300
- How do you feel?
- Like a duck in a shooting gallery.

02:00.436 --> 02:02.529
- Cigarette?
- Yeah. Thanks.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.981
Want to make a statement?

02:14.150 --> 02:17.608
Boys tell me I did a couple of murders.
Anything in it?

02:18.788 --> 02:20.881
You got a rope under my ears?

02:21.024 --> 02:23.083
I think you better let me have it.

02:23.159 --> 02:26.492
I'll have to hold it on you,
but I think you better let me have it.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.191
Okay, Dowling. Bring in your notebook.

02:33.102 --> 02:34.160
We're all set.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.102
- The works?
- Yeah.

02:36.673 --> 02:39.198
Some of it you know. If I misquote you...

02:39.275 --> 02:42.335
Let's get it on the record,
from the beginning.

02:42.445 --> 02:44.072
With Malloy, then.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.948
It was about 7:00. Anyway, it was dark.

02:48.017 --> 02:50.986
- Why were you at the office that late?
- I'm a homing pigeon.

02:51.054 --> 02:54.490
I always come back to the stinking coop
no matter how late it is.

02:54.557 --> 02:56.923
I'd been peeking
under old Sunday sections...

02:56.993 --> 03:01.123
for a barber named Dominic
whose wife wanted him back. I forget why.

03:01.197 --> 03:05.531
I only took the job because my bank
account was trying to crawl under a duck.

03:05.802 --> 03:07.633
And I never found him.

03:08.571 --> 03:11.938
I just found out all over again
how big this city is.

03:12.308 --> 03:13.639
<i>My feet hurt.</i>

03:13.710 --> 03:16.406
<i>And my mind</i>
<i>felt like a plumber's handkerchief.</i>

03:16.479 --> 03:18.572
<i>The office bottle hadn't sparked me up...</i>

03:18.648 --> 03:22.982
<i>so I'd taken out my little black book</i>
<i>and decided to go grouse hunting.</i>

03:23.653 --> 03:27.020
<i>Nothing like soft shoulders</i>
<i>to improve my morale.</i>

03:29.292 --> 03:32.921
<i>The soft shoulders had a date,</i>
<i>but she thought she could fix that...</i>

03:32.996 --> 03:35.464
<i>and was going to check right back.</i>

03:36.599 --> 03:40.865
<i>There's something about the dead silence</i>
<i>of an office building at night...</i>

03:40.937 --> 03:42.495
<i>Not quite real.</i>

03:42.906 --> 03:47.240
<i>The traffic down below was something</i>
<i>that didn't have anything to do with me.</i>

04:00.256 --> 04:02.884
I seen your name
on the blackboard downstairs.

04:03.726 --> 04:04.818
Yeah?

04:06.296 --> 04:08.161
I come up to see you.

04:11.034 --> 04:12.831
You're a private eye?

04:13.703 --> 04:15.170
That's right.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.839
I'd like you to look for somebody.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.644
I'm closed up, pal. Come around
tomorrow, and we'll talk about it.

04:25.715 --> 04:28.206
I looked for her where she worked...

04:28.751 --> 04:30.184
but I've been out of touch.

04:30.253 --> 04:31.777
Okay. Tomorrow.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.688
I'd like to show you where she worked.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.338
Okay. You show me where she worked.

04:51.107 --> 04:52.335
This way.

04:55.611 --> 04:58.478
<i>The joint looked like trouble,</i>
<i>but that didn't bother me.</i>

04:58.548 --> 04:59.810
<i>Nothing bothered me.</i>

04:59.882 --> 05:03.318
<i>The two twenties felt nice and snug</i>
<i>against my appendix.</i>

05:04.053 --> 05:07.989
<i>I tried to picture him in love</i>
<i>with somebody, but it didn't work.</i>

05:08.057 --> 05:09.922
They changed it a lot.

05:10.460 --> 05:13.588
There was a stage where she worked,
and some booths.

05:14.263 --> 05:16.697
Pink flowers was in the slatwork.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.464
She was cute as lace pants.

05:20.703 --> 05:22.068
A redhead.

05:23.806 --> 05:26.001
Eight years since I seen her.

05:26.542 --> 05:29.978
Six she didn't write,
but she'll have a reason.

05:30.313 --> 05:32.543
- What's she do, sing?
- Yeah.

05:33.616 --> 05:36.380
Let's you and me go up
and nibble a couple.

05:54.871 --> 05:55.929
Boss.

06:09.185 --> 06:11.983
- Whiskey. Call yours.
- Whiskey.

06:12.488 --> 06:14.012
You never heard of Velma?

06:14.090 --> 06:16.354
Look, Joe, I'm sorry about your girl.

06:16.426 --> 06:18.860
And I know how you feel,
but she ain't here.

06:18.928 --> 06:21.260
No girl's been here
since I owned this place.

06:21.330 --> 06:23.025
No show. No noise.

06:23.399 --> 06:25.833
I got a reputation for no trouble.

06:31.407 --> 06:33.238
She used to work here.

06:34.844 --> 06:36.311
You ask him about Velma.

06:36.379 --> 06:39.075
We've been over all that. Drink up, Joe.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.988
You remember Velma?

06:52.061 --> 06:54.962
I'll have to request
you don't bother the customers.

06:55.431 --> 06:59.026
So far you rate me polite?
I don't bother you none.

07:15.084 --> 07:18.053
Some guys has the wrong ideas
when to get fancy.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.349
Whiskey.

07:21.424 --> 07:24.951
Come on. Eight years is a lot of gin.
They don't remember Velma.

07:25.027 --> 07:29.396
- Who asked you to stick your face in?
- You did. Remember me?

07:29.866 --> 07:32.630
I'm the guy who came in with you, chunky.

07:32.735 --> 07:35.966
Moose. The name is Moose.
On account of I'm large.

07:36.372 --> 07:39.364
- Moose Malloy. You heard of me, maybe?
- Maybe.

07:41.511 --> 07:43.342
They changed it a lot.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.037
There was a stage
where she worked and some booths.

07:46.115 --> 07:47.639
You said that.

07:48.918 --> 07:50.943
I'm beginning not to like it here.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.394
- Maybe I told you too much.
- No.

08:07.303 --> 08:09.498
- We was to be married.
- What happened?

08:09.572 --> 08:12.234
Where do you figure I've been away
those eight years?

08:12.308 --> 08:14.037
Catching butterflies.

08:14.110 --> 08:16.840
I put away a few grand before I went up.

08:17.113 --> 08:21.049
- You been in the caboose ever?
- Just a couple of overnight stops.

08:21.350 --> 08:23.580
Okay. You find Velma.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.147
- She got a last name?
- Velma. Velma Valento.

08:30.226 --> 08:33.991
- How will I get in touch with you?
- I get in touch with you.

08:39.168 --> 08:41.864
<i>I spent a buck in another bar</i>
<i>for some history.</i>

08:42.238 --> 08:44.729
<i>Mike Florian ran the joint until 1939.</i>

08:44.807 --> 08:47.537
<i>He died in 1940</i>
<i>in the middle of a glass of beer.</i>

08:48.010 --> 08:50.035
<i>His wife Jessie finished it for him.</i>

08:50.112 --> 08:52.603
<i>Tracing her was easy. I could do that.</i>

08:52.682 --> 08:55.446
<i>A bright third grader</i>
<i>could have done it, but not Malloy.</i>

08:55.518 --> 08:57.110
<i>He needed a private detective.</i>

08:58.521 --> 09:02.252
<i>She was a charming middle-aged lady</i>
<i>with a face like a bucket of mud.</i>

09:02.325 --> 09:05.021
<i>I gave her a drink.</i>
<i>She was a gal who'd take a drink...</i>

09:05.094 --> 09:07.324
<i>if she had to knock you down</i>
<i>to get the bottle.</i>

09:07.396 --> 09:10.991
That liquor's been keeping
the right company all right.

09:13.135 --> 09:17.162
Just hold it careful, mister.
This ain't no time to drop anything.

09:21.911 --> 09:23.902
What was it we was talking about?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.346
The red-headed girl named Velma Valento.

09:26.415 --> 09:29.475
Used to work in your husband's place
on Central Avenue.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.177
Who was it you said you was, mister?

09:34.056 --> 09:35.216
There.

09:38.894 --> 09:40.384
A private cop.

09:40.529 --> 09:42.690
You didn't say that, mister...

09:43.666 --> 09:45.998
but I knew you wasn't no regular cop.

09:46.068 --> 09:48.559
No regular cop
ever bought a drink of that stuff.

09:48.638 --> 09:50.503
Do you remember Velma?

09:50.873 --> 09:53.205
- Who was that, copper?
- Velma.

09:54.810 --> 09:57.745
No. I don't seem to right off.

09:59.715 --> 10:01.910
What was it you said you wanted her for?

10:01.984 --> 10:04.248
I'm tracing her for a client of mine.

10:07.490 --> 10:10.618
I shouldn't ought to sit here
and bother with you...

10:10.693 --> 10:13.560
but when I like a guy
and he buys me a drink...

10:13.629 --> 10:15.620
the ceiling is the limit.

10:18.167 --> 10:21.864
Hold on to your chair
and don't step on no snakes.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.762
I got an idea.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.445
No peeking.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.447
Them is all Mike left me,
them and his old clothes.

11:14.857 --> 11:16.415
Publicity, that is.

11:16.492 --> 11:19.290
But them dolls didn't never get
in the papers...

11:19.362 --> 11:22.820
at least not in connection with the place,
they didn't.

11:41.350 --> 11:44.080
Why did you hide this picture of Velma?
Why did you hide it?

11:44.153 --> 11:45.882
Give it to me!

11:48.391 --> 11:49.722
She's dead.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.256
She was a nice kid...

11:53.496 --> 11:54.827
but she's dead.

11:55.030 --> 11:58.557
- Moose will be sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. Won't he, though?

12:01.137 --> 12:04.004
Yeah, he's out. He's out,
and he's looking for his girl.

12:04.073 --> 12:06.234
Why did you hide her picture?

12:06.575 --> 12:09.510
I don't know anybody
by the name of Moose, copper.

12:09.578 --> 12:11.375
Beat it!

12:13.416 --> 12:17.546
I don't know anybody
by the name of Moose.

12:54.890 --> 12:57.381
<i>Suddenly, she wasn't drunk anymore.</i>

12:57.860 --> 13:00.590
<i>Her hand was steady, and she was cool...</i>

13:01.430 --> 13:05.025
<i>like somebody making</i>
<i>funeral arrangements for a murder...</i>

13:05.601 --> 13:07.296
<i>not yet committed.</i>

13:14.143 --> 13:15.576
Hello, sweetheart.

13:15.644 --> 13:17.703
I let in a guy a couple hours ago.

13:17.780 --> 13:20.214
He said it was important. Okay?

13:20.282 --> 13:23.251
He's in love and in a big hurry.
He'll get over that.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.877
- Cute little fella, isn't he?
- Yeah.

13:28.157 --> 13:29.920
- Sober?
- Yeah.

13:32.294 --> 13:33.784
He smells real nice.

13:50.279 --> 13:51.473
Mr. Marlowe?

13:53.949 --> 13:56.679
I took the liberty
of waiting here, Mr. Marlowe.

13:58.220 --> 14:01.018
The attendant gave me the impression
I could expect you soon.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.921
Who put in the pitch for me, Mr. Marriott?

14:02.992 --> 14:05.790
- I beg your pardon?
- How did you get my name?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.029
As a matter of fact...

14:08.097 --> 14:11.294
I decided to employ a private investigator
only today.

14:11.367 --> 14:14.598
This being Saturday afternoon,
I failed to reach anyone by phone...

14:14.670 --> 14:17.230
and was somewhat at a loss as to...

14:18.073 --> 14:21.804
The directory listed several in this
neighborhood, so I took a chance...

14:21.877 --> 14:23.845
I'm in a clutch at the moment.

14:24.079 --> 14:26.775
I'm pretty busy.
I couldn't take on anything big.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.339
What's the job?

14:34.023 --> 14:37.584
I'll require your services
for just a few hours this evening.

14:37.660 --> 14:40.629
I'm meeting some men
shortly after midnight.

14:40.696 --> 14:42.823
I'm paying them some money.

14:42.898 --> 14:45.492
You better get your flaps down,
or you'll take off.

14:45.568 --> 14:46.899
What's the deal, blackmail?

14:46.969 --> 14:50.666
I'm not in the habit
of giving people grounds for blackmail.

14:51.173 --> 14:54.142
I've simply agreed to serve
as bearer of the money.

14:54.209 --> 14:57.144
- How much and what for?
- I can't go into that.

14:57.513 --> 15:00.607
You just want me to go along
and hold your hand?

15:00.916 --> 15:02.816
I'm afraid I don't like your manner.

15:02.885 --> 15:05.820
I've had complaints about it.
But it keeps getting worse.

15:05.888 --> 15:08.254
How much are you offering me
for doing nothing?

15:08.324 --> 15:11.191
I really hadn't gotten around
to thinking about it.

15:11.260 --> 15:14.787
You suppose you can get around
to thinking about it now?

15:14.897 --> 15:17.832
How would you like
a swift punch on the nose?

15:20.069 --> 15:22.867
I tremble at the thought of such violence.

15:28.143 --> 15:30.737
I'm offering $100
for a few hours of your time.

15:30.813 --> 15:33.805
If that isn't enough, say so.
There's no risk.

15:34.083 --> 15:37.052
Some jewels were taken
from a friend in a holdup.

15:37.119 --> 15:39.679
- I'm buying them back.
- Where and when?

15:40.255 --> 15:44.521
The arrangements specify that I drive
to a secluded canyon above the beach...

15:44.593 --> 15:45.582
Wait a minute.

15:45.661 --> 15:49.028
You drive to a nice, dark petting spot,
hiding me in the backseat...

15:49.098 --> 15:51.566
- to buy back jewelry for a lady...
- I didn't say that.

15:51.634 --> 15:56.298
...and what you get will be a package
you won't be allowed to open at all.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.239
There's nothing to prevent them
from double-crossing you.

15:59.308 --> 16:01.503
I certainly couldn't do anything to stop it.

16:01.577 --> 16:05.604
Every move's planned. They aren't figuring
on roughing you up if you play ball.

16:05.681 --> 16:09.242
But they wouldn't like you being twins.
One of us might get hurt.

16:09.351 --> 16:12.718
I'm afraid I can't do anything
for you, Mr. Marriott.

16:14.256 --> 16:17.555
But I'll take your $100
and tag along for the ride.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.498
<i>I carry the shopping money, too,</i>
<i>and I do the driving.</i>

16:36.045 --> 16:37.273
<i>We were watched.</i>

16:37.346 --> 16:40.440
<i>I didn't see anything.</i>
<i>I felt it in my stomach.</i>

16:41.216 --> 16:43.241
<i>I was a toad on a wet rock.</i>

16:43.452 --> 16:45.716
<i>A snake was looking</i>
<i>at the back of my neck.</i>

16:45.788 --> 16:49.417
- There should be some white posts soon.
- Pull your head in.

16:51.393 --> 16:55.090
A path there goes down into the hollow
where we're to wait.

16:56.398 --> 16:58.263
Check: White posts.

17:05.641 --> 17:08.734
You sit tight.
I'll go down and have a look-see.

18:36.565 --> 18:39.557
Looks like a tryout
to see if you obey orders.

18:53.982 --> 18:56.849
<i>I caught the blackjack right behind my ear.</i>

18:56.919 --> 18:59.183
<i>A black pool opened up at my feet.</i>

18:59.254 --> 19:02.314
<i>I dived in. It had no bottom.</i>

19:03.792 --> 19:06.955
<i>I felt pretty good... like an amputated leg.</i>

19:25.247 --> 19:27.340
Are you all right? What happened?

20:08.023 --> 20:10.116
<i>He was doubled up on his face...</i>

20:10.192 --> 20:14.424
<i>in that bag-of-old-clothes position</i>
<i>that always means the same thing:</i>

20:14.963 --> 20:17.454
<i>He had been killed by an amateur...</i>

20:17.799 --> 20:21.462
<i>or by somebody who wanted it</i>
<i>to look like an amateur job.</i>

20:22.437 --> 20:25.895
<i>Nobody else would hit a man</i>
<i>that many times with a sap.</i>

20:34.182 --> 20:36.742
The oftener you go over it,
the sillier it sounds.

20:36.818 --> 20:41.778
You know nothing about Marriott, how
much money he had, or what it was for.

20:41.857 --> 20:44.553
Trusting soul, wasn't he?
Letting you carry the payoff.

20:44.626 --> 20:47.754
Sorry I don't have it.
After I beat Marriott's brains out...

20:47.829 --> 20:51.765
and just before I hit myself on the back
of the head, I hid it under a bush.

20:52.467 --> 20:56.801
Supposing a jewel outfit got the idea
of using a detective as a utility man...

20:56.872 --> 20:58.601
for contacts and payoffs.

20:58.774 --> 21:00.935
Suppose they ran out of uses for him.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.705
They might try
to hang a murder around his neck.

21:03.779 --> 21:04.939
Great.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.608
Now I'm a finger for a heist mob.
Also I'm Jack the Ripper.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.709
Look, I try to be helpful.

21:10.786 --> 21:14.085
I get up off the nice cold ground
and walk five miles to a phone...

21:14.156 --> 21:15.987
right after having my head treated.

21:16.058 --> 21:19.425
I lead you to the body instead of
letting you find it next Christmas.

21:19.494 --> 21:21.621
I tell you all I know, four times!

21:21.797 --> 21:24.265
It sounds screwy. All right, it is screwy.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.926
Sometimes I'm not smart,
but it's all I know.

21:27.269 --> 21:29.533
I'm tired of listening to your bum guesses.

21:29.604 --> 21:31.401
Either book me or let me go home.

21:31.473 --> 21:34.340
Getting personal,
I don't like looking at you, either.

21:34.409 --> 21:37.606
I don't like sitting here.
I'd much rather be home in bed, too.

21:37.679 --> 21:41.479
I'd rather dig eggshells out of garbage
cans than pry information out of you.

21:41.550 --> 21:45.281
- I get it. You don't like me.
- No. I never have, and I never will.

21:45.354 --> 21:47.720
You're a not a detective,
you're a slot machine.

21:47.789 --> 21:50.053
You'd slit your own throat for six bits.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.355
- Now, look...
- All I want from you is silence.

21:52.427 --> 21:55.396
One false move, and you'll be locked up
as a material witness.

21:55.464 --> 21:59.696
It's that kind of a case, with the witnesses
gagged and the papers crying for news?

21:59.768 --> 22:01.759
I'll get them their murderer.

22:01.837 --> 22:05.466
You'll get him about the time
you get your third set of teeth.

22:05.540 --> 22:07.974
Okay. Go on home to bed.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.641
Stick to your story if you want.
Play it dumb, play it any way...

22:11.713 --> 22:13.578
but stay out of my way.

22:13.715 --> 22:15.979
And stay out of the way of Marriott's pals.

22:16.051 --> 22:19.612
I've been after these boys for a long time,
and I'm close. I'll get them.

22:19.688 --> 22:20.882
So watch your step...

22:20.956 --> 22:25.017
or I may have to pick you up
in the same basket with Jules Amthor.

22:26.528 --> 22:27.620
Yeah?

22:29.364 --> 22:32.697
- Is Amthor mixed up in this?
- So you know him, then?

22:33.135 --> 22:35.695
I know lots of people in this town...

22:35.837 --> 22:39.534
but I never heard of Jules Amthor.
It's a bad guess.

22:45.414 --> 22:48.850
Business is getting better. And prettier.

22:54.222 --> 22:57.123
Mr. Marlowe, I'm Miss Allison, <i>The Post.</i>

22:57.926 --> 23:00.918
The police aren't being helpful
on the Marriott case. I wonder...

23:00.996 --> 23:02.554
How did you know about me?

23:02.631 --> 23:06.226
I have friends at the City Hall, naturally.
That's my business.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.235
I'd just get you in a lot of trouble.

23:08.303 --> 23:12.000
Did Marriott tell you
who owned the jade he was buying back?

23:12.674 --> 23:16.075
They'll never know where I heard it,
but if I know something...

23:16.144 --> 23:19.443
I'll be in a much better
bargaining position down there.

23:19.514 --> 23:22.244
Come in, Miss Allison. Have a seat.

23:23.919 --> 23:28.185
No, I wasn't told who owned the jade.
Didn't seem to be any of my business.

23:28.256 --> 23:32.215
- Had you known Marriott some time?
- A couple of weeks. Why?

23:32.561 --> 23:36.657
Did you have any theories about what
happened, or was supposed to happen?

23:36.731 --> 23:38.358
One or two.

23:38.433 --> 23:41.596
- You do your own typing, Miss Allison?
- Why, yes.

23:42.537 --> 23:44.596
I'm not always this brilliant, Miss...

23:45.774 --> 23:46.934
Miss Grayle.

23:47.809 --> 23:49.470
But I'm improving.

23:49.711 --> 23:52.441
What do you do besides playing reporter?

23:56.284 --> 23:59.276
You're a hot rock anyway.
I should toss you to the cops.

23:59.354 --> 24:03.290
All I could tell them last night was that
Marriott was buying back some jewelry.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.656
You'd impress them
with that line about the jade.

24:05.727 --> 24:08.992
Have you ever known a Velma Valento,
Miss Grayle, a singer?

24:09.097 --> 24:12.294
It was another case, anyway.
I was just hoping...

24:14.603 --> 24:19.097
Did your friends at City Hall
tell you about the jade, too?

24:19.941 --> 24:22.842
- Who does it belong to?
- What's your interest in it?

24:23.678 --> 24:26.772
We won't get anyplace
answering questions with more questions.

24:26.848 --> 24:29.282
- I'll take my answer first.
- Okay.

24:29.985 --> 24:32.476
I'm interested in the jade,
now that I know about it...

24:32.554 --> 24:36.251
because I'd like to know who besides me
might have killed Marriott.

24:36.324 --> 24:39.384
He gave me $100
to take care of him and I didn't.

24:39.461 --> 24:42.089
I'm a small businessman
in a messy business...

24:42.164 --> 24:44.155
but I like to follow through on a sale.

24:44.232 --> 24:47.030
The jade belongs to my father.
Now unlock the door.

24:47.102 --> 24:49.161
I got it from Marriott it belonged to a lady.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.262
My father happens to be married.

24:52.274 --> 24:54.401
Yes, of course he would be.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.603
Then your mother was wearing it
the night of the holdup?

24:58.680 --> 25:00.443
She's not my mother.

25:02.484 --> 25:05.044
Which one sent you here to feel me out?

25:05.554 --> 25:07.454
It was my own brilliant idea.

25:10.592 --> 25:14.824
Before I see the police,
I think I'll have a talk with your father...

25:14.896 --> 25:16.796
and your father's wife.

25:17.866 --> 25:18.890
Open the door.

25:24.539 --> 25:28.839
<i>It was a nice little front yard.</i>
<i>Cozy, okay for the average family...</i>

25:28.910 --> 25:31.606
<i>only you'd need a compass</i>
<i>to go to the mailbox.</i>

25:31.780 --> 25:35.716
<i>The house was all right, too,</i>
<i>but it wasn't as big as Buckingham Palace.</i>

25:36.117 --> 25:38.915
<i>I had to wait</i>
<i>while she sold me to the old folks.</i>

25:38.987 --> 25:41.512
It was like waiting to buy a crypt
in a mausoleum.

25:41.590 --> 25:42.989
Mr. Marlowe.

25:53.668 --> 25:54.999
Mr. Marlowe, Father.

25:55.070 --> 25:56.537
- How do you do?
- How are you?

25:56.605 --> 25:58.129
It's good of you to come.

25:58.206 --> 25:59.696
This is Mrs. Grayle.

26:04.779 --> 26:07.543
Are you familiar with jade, Mr. Marlowe?

26:11.386 --> 26:13.115
What do you know about jade?

26:13.188 --> 26:15.713
It's green, isn't it?

26:16.057 --> 26:17.820
Yeah. No, thanks.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.619
Jade, Mr. Marlowe...

26:19.694 --> 26:23.255
is not sufficiently known
or appreciated in this country.

26:24.032 --> 26:26.193
The great rulers of the East, however...

26:26.268 --> 26:27.701
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

26:27.769 --> 26:32.763
The great rulers of the East have treated it
with a reverence accorded no other stone.

26:33.375 --> 26:36.538
They've spent years
searching for a single piece.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.909
Fei-ts'ui jade, in which I, as a collector...

26:40.148 --> 26:44.847
am particularly interested,
is extremely valuable.

26:46.354 --> 26:49.118
I'm afraid,
like most old men with a hobby...

26:49.190 --> 26:51.283
I'm inclined to be a bit of a bore.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.451
Keep going.

26:52.694 --> 26:56.460
But since my daughter
has brought you into this matter...

26:56.931 --> 26:58.523
injudiciously perhaps...

26:58.600 --> 27:00.830
I was already in it up to my eyebrows.

27:00.902 --> 27:05.236
I take it the whatchamacallit you lost
was this stuff, fei-ts'ui?

27:05.507 --> 27:07.907
A necklace, Mr. Marlowe.

27:08.443 --> 27:12.243
A necklace. 60 beads
of about six carats each.

27:12.314 --> 27:15.215
- Worth how much?
- That's difficult to say.

27:15.417 --> 27:19.114
The Chinese government
had a somewhat larger necklace...

27:19.621 --> 27:23.352
which once brought as much as $125,000.

27:24.959 --> 27:29.259
You were about to ask, Mr. Marlowe,
why I should be so reckless...

27:29.331 --> 27:32.732
as to go out in the evening
wearing an irreplaceable necklace.

27:34.169 --> 27:35.932
Something like that.

27:37.339 --> 27:39.466
It's unanswerable. I shouldn't have.

27:39.541 --> 27:41.771
I never should have worn it out.

27:42.377 --> 27:44.174
Where was the stickup?

27:44.346 --> 27:48.339
If you'll excuse me,
I'm feeling a little tired.

27:48.983 --> 27:52.885
But Mrs. Grayle will tell you
anything else you want to know.

27:53.021 --> 27:54.545
Goodbye, sir.

27:58.827 --> 28:02.126
We're naturally anxious
to locate the necklace, Mr. Marlowe.

28:02.197 --> 28:05.064
I only hope it can be managed
without any publicity.

28:05.133 --> 28:06.361
Yeah. So do I.

28:08.303 --> 28:11.466
Let's dispense
with the polite drinking, shall we?

28:13.007 --> 28:15.703
- Would you mind...
- No. Not at all.

28:16.478 --> 28:19.038
I didn't think
there were enough murders these days...

28:19.114 --> 28:22.379
to make detecting very attractive
to a young man.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.812
I stir up trouble on the side.

28:24.986 --> 28:27.147
How much money
was in Marriott's envelope?

28:27.222 --> 28:28.280
$8,000.

28:28.356 --> 28:30.290
- Cheap at the price.
- Dirt cheap.

28:30.358 --> 28:33.293
We guessed
they didn't know its real value.

28:34.529 --> 28:37.657
Who knew you'd be wearing the necklace
this particular night?

28:37.732 --> 28:40.428
My maid, perhaps,
but she's had a hundred chances.

28:40.502 --> 28:42.299
- Besides, I trust her.
- Why?

28:43.004 --> 28:45.370
I don't know. I trust some people.

28:45.874 --> 28:48.468
- I trust you.
- Did you trust Marriott?

28:48.943 --> 28:52.401
Not in some things. In others, yes.
There are degrees.

28:54.416 --> 28:56.884
I thought detectives were heavy drinkers.

28:57.318 --> 28:58.979
Some of them are.

28:59.287 --> 29:02.120
Some of them just encourage
other people to drink.

29:02.757 --> 29:05.920
- Shall I tell you about the holdup?
- It might help.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.758
Lin and I had been out dancing.
He was bringing me home.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.321
- Where were you stopped?
- Near here.

29:11.733 --> 29:13.530
Does it matter a lot?

29:14.068 --> 29:15.865
Not too much at the moment.

29:15.937 --> 29:18.030
How many other Marriotts are there:

29:18.106 --> 29:20.438
Pretty guys who take you dancing?

29:20.909 --> 29:22.740
I'm very fond of my husband.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.775
Only his two-step's getting a little stiff.

29:26.147 --> 29:27.739
Do you know a Jules Amthor?

29:27.816 --> 29:30.410
- I've heard Lin speak of him. Why?
- I don't know.

29:30.485 --> 29:34.080
The cops told me to leave him alone.
That makes me want to look him up.

29:34.155 --> 29:37.784
- Is he a bad boy?
- A lot of Lin's friends are, I'm afraid.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.392
Lin was rather a heel himself...

29:41.162 --> 29:43.062
but he was a nice heel.

29:43.865 --> 29:47.198
The papers didn't say much
except that he wasn't shot.

29:47.602 --> 29:50.093
- How...
- With a sap, only good.

29:50.605 --> 29:53.267
If an elephant had stepped
on his head, same effect.

29:53.341 --> 29:54.706
How awful.

29:55.543 --> 30:00.446
I feel so responsible now,
but it seemed quite simple to buy it back.

30:00.815 --> 30:01.975
I don't understand.

30:02.050 --> 30:05.747
I've tried to put it together
with the holdup, but I can't.

30:06.821 --> 30:09.619
You know, there was something peculiar
about the holdup.

30:09.691 --> 30:13.320
They gave me back one of my rings.
Rather a good one, too.

30:14.596 --> 30:17.087
- What's Amthor's racket?
- I'm not sure.

30:17.165 --> 30:20.862
Some sort of psychic consultant.
A quack, probably.

30:21.636 --> 30:25.800
You see, Lin fancied himself a sculptor,
but he was mixed up about it.

30:25.874 --> 30:28.069
That's why he went to him originally.

30:28.142 --> 30:31.543
He couldn't get started for fear of failure.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.349
I wonder if he'd take my case.

30:45.326 --> 30:47.419
- Who was that?
- Ann.

30:49.464 --> 30:51.022
Strange child.

30:57.972 --> 30:59.803
You will help me, won't you?

30:59.908 --> 31:03.537
Is this for love, or are you paying me
something in money?

31:05.213 --> 31:08.046
I never hired a detective before.
What are the rates?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.947
As much as the traffic will bear.

31:10.018 --> 31:12.452
- When can you start?
- I've already started.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.817
How do I find Amthor?

31:13.888 --> 31:17.517
I'll see if I can smoke him out for you.
He's quite inaccessible.

31:17.825 --> 31:20.487
- Yes?
- Mr. Amthor is here, Mrs. Grayle.

31:20.895 --> 31:22.328
Show him in.

31:23.565 --> 31:28.059
Don't look so judicial.
He really is inaccessible.

31:28.136 --> 31:32.129
I hadn't the faintest idea he was coming.
I haven't seen him in months.

31:35.176 --> 31:36.871
How do you spend your evenings?

31:36.945 --> 31:39.436
Recently, I've been playing
Button Button with the cops.

31:39.514 --> 31:42.381
- And then where do you go?
- I'm in the book.

31:43.017 --> 31:44.917
Let's see what's on his mind.

31:45.486 --> 31:46.851
I'm sorry.

31:48.222 --> 31:50.213
This is Mr. Marlowe. Mr. Amthor.

31:50.291 --> 31:53.283
Mr. Marlowe's a private detective.
He was with Lin when...

31:53.361 --> 31:56.228
I was hired as a bodyguard
and bungled the job.

31:56.297 --> 31:58.527
Now I'm investigating myself.

31:58.633 --> 32:02.433
You must forgive me
for not coming sooner. It's such a shock.

32:02.670 --> 32:05.230
These things are so difficult to believe.

32:05.306 --> 32:08.139
Close friend, someone you know so well...

32:08.610 --> 32:11.773
- What could have happened?
- I've got a couple of notions.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.780
When could you help me work them out?

32:13.848 --> 32:16.510
I wouldn't make a good detective,
Mr. Marlowe, and l...

32:16.584 --> 32:18.745
I know. You are inaccessible.

32:19.854 --> 32:22.015
In what way do you think I could help you?

32:22.090 --> 32:25.423
I spent last night with the police.
It was their idea.

32:25.860 --> 32:29.125
They took it for granted
that if I'd known Marriott, I knew you, too.

32:29.197 --> 32:32.166
They told me not to get too close to you,
said you'd bite.

32:32.233 --> 32:34.258
You look harmless to me.

32:34.335 --> 32:36.565
I'd be glad to arrange an interview if...

32:36.638 --> 32:39.334
Just leave the number with Mrs. Grayle.

32:40.942 --> 32:44.935
Don't go to any special trouble.
I'll bring my own crystal ball.

32:54.489 --> 32:57.890
- How do you get out of this funhouse?
- This way, sir.

33:03.498 --> 33:04.692
Come in.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.561
It's on the bed.

33:11.939 --> 33:14.840
This is six weeks
since you sent your laundry out.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.706
You must be in love.

33:16.944 --> 33:18.878
Bring it back tomorrow.

33:30.458 --> 33:33.552
You've got a nice build
for a private detective.

33:34.062 --> 33:35.689
It gets me around.

33:36.197 --> 33:38.995
How does one get to be
a private detective?

33:39.600 --> 33:42.330
You don't mind my sizing you up a little?

33:42.570 --> 33:45.095
Most are ex-cops.
I worked for the D.A., got fired.

33:45.173 --> 33:48.301
- Not for incompetence, surely.
- For talking back.

33:48.676 --> 33:52.874
I had an interesting childhood, too, but
you didn't drop in to get a biography.

33:52.947 --> 33:55.882
I thought you'd like to know
what Amthor said...

33:55.983 --> 33:57.883
and I wanted to make it official.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.182
Shall we call this a retainer?

34:04.192 --> 34:06.456
Yeah, let's call it a retainer.

34:06.761 --> 34:09.059
If the cops get to you, you sent for me.

34:09.130 --> 34:12.065
I didn't want to take the case.
You talked me into it.

34:12.132 --> 34:15.000
- You hired me.
- Do they have to know about me?

34:15.536 --> 34:17.128
Would that bother you?

34:17.405 --> 34:19.304
We live pretty much by ourselves.

34:19.373 --> 34:22.934
And my husband has a morbid fear
of any kind of publicity.

34:23.110 --> 34:24.635
He's not very strong.

34:24.978 --> 34:27.539
I'll manage it. How did it go with Amthor?

34:27.681 --> 34:29.842
I'm stubborn. I don't like being rushed.

34:29.917 --> 34:34.353
I figured, the way you're dressed,
you're on the town, stopped by here to...

34:34.655 --> 34:37.748
I was hoping
you'd buy me a drink somewhere...

34:38.059 --> 34:40.425
or don't you ever relax
when you're on a case?

34:40.495 --> 34:42.621
Not in public. It's too crowded.

34:42.697 --> 34:44.527
Do you like the Coconut Beach Club?

34:44.599 --> 34:47.159
Never been there. I'm the drive-in type.

34:47.235 --> 34:49.328
The lights would be flattering to you.

34:49.402 --> 34:51.928
They might even mellow you a little.

34:52.607 --> 34:56.007
It's the sort of place
where you have to wear a shirt.

34:56.944 --> 34:58.605
Be right with you.

35:28.743 --> 35:32.804
- I think I'll put some powder my nose.
- You've already got powder on it.

35:45.693 --> 35:47.092
Mr. Marlowe.

35:47.728 --> 35:48.956
Look...

35:49.964 --> 35:52.558
I like you, but I'm too old to play games.

35:52.633 --> 35:56.194
If you're jealous of your stepmother,
we can talk about that tomorrow.

35:56.270 --> 35:59.467
She'll be here soon, and I don't want
you two tangling in public.

35:59.540 --> 36:02.100
There's no danger.
You're being sidetracked.

36:02.176 --> 36:03.643
Helen's gone by now.

36:03.711 --> 36:06.578
- What do you mean sidetracked?
- You'll find out.

36:06.647 --> 36:09.013
I'm just staying long enough
to speak my piece.

36:09.217 --> 36:12.653
Tell me, are you a member of a
syndicate with international contacts...

36:12.720 --> 36:15.211
or do you get all your information
by eavesdropping?

36:15.289 --> 36:18.383
- What did she ask you to do?
- You missed that part?

36:18.659 --> 36:21.287
She wanted me to kiss her
and find her jade necklace.

36:21.362 --> 36:24.195
I may have the order wrong,
but that's the general idea.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.733
You said you were a businessman.
All right.

36:26.801 --> 36:29.702
Whatever she was willing to pay you,
I'll up it.

36:29.871 --> 36:32.897
Just stay away from her.
Forget the whole thing.

36:33.774 --> 36:36.641
What's the matter?
What are you looking at me like that for?

36:36.711 --> 36:38.303
I don't know.

36:39.146 --> 36:42.741
Surely I'm not corrupting you.
You've been bought off before.

36:42.817 --> 36:45.718
I seem to remember you
from one of my dreams.

36:45.786 --> 36:49.244
- One of the better ones.
- Would it be worth $1,000?

36:54.996 --> 36:55.985
Well?

36:58.633 --> 37:01.067
Stick around. I'll be right back.

37:10.678 --> 37:11.736
Ditch the babe.

37:11.812 --> 37:14.906
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want me to have a love life?

37:14.982 --> 37:16.040
Ditch the babe.

37:16.117 --> 37:19.086
Look, I'm a big boy now.
I blow my own nose and everything.

37:19.153 --> 37:21.849
You hired me. Now stop following me,
or I'll get mad.

37:21.923 --> 37:25.086
- Ditch the babe. I'd like you to meet a guy.
- Take it easy.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.491
Soon gangrene will set in, in those fingers.

37:27.561 --> 37:30.029
- I'd like you to meet a guy.
- Okay.

38:00.194 --> 38:03.027
You do go for the showgirl type,
don't you, sonny?

38:04.799 --> 38:08.496
- Cute, huh?
- Come on. I'd like you to meet a guy.

38:53.080 --> 38:57.039
What's the matter with going up the front
way? Your friend behind in his rent?

39:01.122 --> 39:02.111
Come on.

39:05.993 --> 39:09.292
That's just part of my clothes.
I hardly ever shoot anybody.

39:49.837 --> 39:54.774
On clear days, Mr. Marlowe, you can see
the ships in the harbor at San Pedro.

39:56.544 --> 39:58.876
I trust you brought your crystal ball.

40:04.685 --> 40:05.947
I don't get it.

40:06.020 --> 40:08.989
You mean there are some things
you do not understand?

40:09.423 --> 40:13.587
I've always credited the private detective
with a high degree of omniscience.

40:13.861 --> 40:16.227
Or is that only true in rental fiction?

40:16.597 --> 40:17.928
I'd like you to ask him now.

40:17.998 --> 40:20.091
- Don't be impatient.
- Ask me what?

40:20.234 --> 40:23.067
- Can't you do your own asking?
- Take it easy, big boy.

40:23.137 --> 40:26.004
The boss wants a nice, quiet talk
with your friend.

40:32.113 --> 40:35.640
I believe you wanted to discuss
my relationship with the police.

40:36.150 --> 40:39.381
I usually come in through the front door,
big as life.

40:39.987 --> 40:42.785
I merely wanted to take you
on the wing, so to speak.

40:42.857 --> 40:46.623
An old psychological trick.
It helps us get closer to the real man.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.594
Where did you pick up Malloy?

40:50.197 --> 40:51.391
My dear Mr. Marlowe...

40:51.465 --> 40:55.731
I notice in you an unpleasant tendency
toward abrupt transitions.

40:56.237 --> 40:58.068
A characteristic of your generation.

40:58.139 --> 41:01.700
In this case, I must ask you
to follow some sort of logical progression.

41:01.775 --> 41:03.675
Now, about the police...

41:04.545 --> 41:07.412
Maybe they got something on you
or they're trying to get it.

41:07.481 --> 41:10.450
I didn't expect you to tell me which.
I was just baiting you.

41:10.518 --> 41:12.986
It's an old psychological trick, grandpa.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.522
What's your racket?

41:17.758 --> 41:20.659
I am in a very sensitive profession.

41:21.595 --> 41:22.892
I am a quack.

41:23.931 --> 41:27.367
Which is to say, I'm ahead of my time
in the field of psychic treatment.

41:27.434 --> 41:30.562
Naturally, certain elements
would like to show me in a bad light.

41:30.638 --> 41:33.402
It's entirely possible
they have discussed me with the police.

41:34.542 --> 41:35.770
That is it.

41:37.144 --> 41:41.308
Sorry if I've upset your theories about me,
which must be more elaborate, but...

41:41.382 --> 41:44.510
My theory's pretty simple.
It goes like this:

41:44.952 --> 41:48.115
Marriott was a blackmailer of women.
He was good.

41:48.289 --> 41:51.884
Women liked him around. His interest
in clothes and jewelry came easy.

41:53.194 --> 41:57.153
But he wasn't the whole works. Somebody
told him which women to cultivate...

41:57.231 --> 41:59.631
so he could load them with ice,
go out dancing...

41:59.700 --> 42:02.931
then slip to the phone
and tell the boys where to operate.

42:04.438 --> 42:08.067
And that is your picture
of Marriott and me?

42:10.077 --> 42:14.207
I am slightly disgusted
and very disappointed.

42:17.418 --> 42:20.319
Don't look now,
but Gussie the gun collector is back.

42:20.387 --> 42:22.787
I am very disappointed in you.

42:23.257 --> 42:27.489
Your thinking is untidy,
like most so-called thinking today.

42:27.561 --> 42:28.858
You depress me.

42:30.030 --> 42:32.191
Suppose your theory were correct...

42:32.700 --> 42:34.861
I would have Mrs. Grayle's jade now,
wouldn't I?

42:34.935 --> 42:38.098
- Unless something went wrong.
- What could have gone wrong?

42:38.172 --> 42:42.199
Marriott could have lost his nerve
and rung in a private dick.

42:42.810 --> 42:45.779
Take a private dick who'd risk his neck
for $100.

42:45.846 --> 42:47.473
He might get ambitious.

42:47.548 --> 42:51.279
He might figure an expensive necklace
would be nice to have in the bank.

42:51.352 --> 42:53.718
This hypothetical detective of yours...

42:54.188 --> 42:57.783
he might be willing to part
with the necklace for a consideration.

42:58.025 --> 42:59.652
Could be, if he had it.

42:59.893 --> 43:01.588
How big a consideration?

43:02.129 --> 43:05.428
It would be difficult to discuss that
until he produced the necklace.

43:05.499 --> 43:08.525
He might be bluffing,
hoping to gain information.

43:08.602 --> 43:13.437
In which case, a great thinker might try
to shake something out of him.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.570
You wouldn't suggest that?

43:18.012 --> 43:21.277
Only if you wanted
to wear your face backwards for a while.

43:23.083 --> 43:26.143
No need for us to be
at each other's throats, Mr. Marlowe.

43:26.220 --> 43:28.518
There's really no need for subterfuge.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.456
I want that jade.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.383
I'm prepared to buy it from you
if you have it...

43:33.460 --> 43:35.018
or if you can get it.

43:35.262 --> 43:37.162
Supposing I haven't got it...

43:37.431 --> 43:39.695
or supposing I don't want to sell...

43:43.604 --> 43:45.538
You get him to tell you yet?

43:46.273 --> 43:48.434
He refuses to tell me where she is.

43:49.310 --> 43:51.335
I gave you some dough to find Velma.

43:51.412 --> 43:54.939
- I don't like you not telling where she is.
- Who says I got her?

43:56.917 --> 44:00.444
- I don't like nobody to kid with me.
- He's lying. He knows where she is.

44:00.521 --> 44:02.819
Take it easy. We'll get it out of him.

44:06.260 --> 44:09.161
How'd you get mixed up with these guys?
What's the connection?

44:09.229 --> 44:11.026
He's okay. He tells me about you.

44:11.098 --> 44:13.293
If he tells you I know where Velma is,
he's nuts.

44:13.367 --> 44:15.301
He just picked you up to do his dirty work.

44:15.369 --> 44:18.827
He's after jewelry. He thinks I've got it.
Ask him about Velma.

44:18.972 --> 44:21.600
- I paid you to find her.
- Keep your shirt on.

44:21.675 --> 44:24.371
- Where you got her?
- I haven't got her, you nitwit.

44:24.445 --> 44:26.777
Where's the necklace?
Tell me and I'll stop him.

44:26.847 --> 44:29.975
You shouldn't have done that.
You shouldn't have hit me.

44:36.790 --> 44:38.519
Let him breathe a little.

44:39.993 --> 44:42.359
- Where's the necklace?
- I haven't got it.

44:42.429 --> 44:44.158
All right. A little more.

44:47.034 --> 44:49.525
Let him go. He's tame.

44:55.943 --> 44:59.401
I could teach you, but to what purpose?

44:59.813 --> 45:02.748
A dirty, stupid little man
in a dirty, stupid world.

45:02.816 --> 45:05.546
One spot of brightness on you,
and you'd still be that.

45:05.619 --> 45:06.881
Isn't that so?

45:12.526 --> 45:16.121
I'm glad you hit me. It helps.

45:16.930 --> 45:18.522
Helps me a great deal.

45:26.340 --> 45:29.798
<i>The black pool opened up at my feet again,</i>
<i>and I dived in.</i>

45:31.378 --> 45:33.710
<i>Next thing I remember,</i>
<i>I was going somewhere.</i>

45:33.781 --> 45:36.045
<i>It was not my idea.</i>

45:37.251 --> 45:40.709
<i>The rest of it was a crazy,</i>
<i>coked-up dream.</i>

45:40.854 --> 45:42.788
<i>I had never been there before.</i>

45:49.630 --> 45:51.495
<i>Where's the necklace?</i>

46:11.251 --> 46:12.980
<i>You shouldn't have hit me.</i>

46:59.666 --> 47:03.432
<i>The window was open,</i>
<i>but the smoke didn't move.</i>

47:04.037 --> 47:07.564
<i>It was a gray web, woven by 1,000 spiders.</i>

47:08.475 --> 47:11.342
<i>I wondered how they got them</i>
<i>to work together.</i>

47:18.585 --> 47:19.916
Help!

47:26.293 --> 47:28.227
What strikes you funny, pally?

47:30.864 --> 47:34.095
- The smoke.
- The smoke strikes you funny?

47:39.172 --> 47:42.630
- Where am I?
- You like also to know where you're at.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.433
Anything else, pally?

47:45.379 --> 47:47.040
The doors are too small.

47:49.616 --> 47:51.174
The stairs are made of dough.

47:51.251 --> 47:55.153
I think this guy's nuts.
Do you think he's nuts?

47:56.623 --> 47:58.113
Skip it.

47:59.326 --> 48:04.059
- I think I'll take myself a nap again.
- Better make it just that, pally.

48:24.484 --> 48:26.281
<i>My throat felt sore...</i>

48:26.353 --> 48:29.481
<i>but the fingers feeling it</i>
<i>didn't feel anything.</i>

48:29.856 --> 48:33.553
<i>They were just a bunch of bananas</i>
<i>that looked like fingers.</i>

48:40.968 --> 48:43.493
<i>I wondered what I was shot full of.</i>

48:43.704 --> 48:47.470
<i>Something to keep me quiet</i>
<i>or something to make me talk.</i>

48:48.442 --> 48:49.841
<i>Maybe both.</i>

48:56.383 --> 49:00.319
<i>Okay, Marlowe, I said to myself,</i>
<i>you're a tough guy.</i>

49:00.387 --> 49:04.323
<i>You've been sapped twice, choked,</i>
<i>beaten silly with a gun...</i>

49:04.591 --> 49:08.789
<i>shot in the arm until you're</i>
<i>as crazy as a couple of waltzing mice.</i>

49:08.962 --> 49:11.487
<i>Now let's see you</i>
<i>do something really tough...</i>

49:11.565 --> 49:13.658
<i>like putting your pants on.</i>

49:43.030 --> 49:46.659
<i>Okay, you cuckoo, walk and talk.</i>

49:46.867 --> 49:49.461
<i>What about? Anything. Everything.</i>

49:49.903 --> 49:53.839
<i>Just talk and keep walking.</i>
<i>You're getting out of here.</i>

49:54.708 --> 49:57.006
<i>That's a beautiful bed.</i>

49:57.077 --> 49:58.305
<i>Stay off it!</i>

50:00.847 --> 50:01.973
<i>Walk!</i>

50:12.659 --> 50:15.127
<i>I walked. I don't know how long.</i>

50:15.529 --> 50:17.394
<i>I didn't have a watch.</i>

50:17.464 --> 50:20.763
<i>They don't make that kind of time</i>
<i>in watches, anyway.</i>

50:29.576 --> 50:31.908
<i>I was ready to talk to somebody.</i>

51:10.751 --> 51:12.776
Help! Help!

51:20.527 --> 51:23.052
That'll quiet your nerves, pally.

52:42.642 --> 52:44.974
The buzzer won't
buy you anything tonight, doc.

52:45.045 --> 52:47.445
I just gave nursey a sleeping tablet.

52:53.887 --> 52:57.618
For three days, you've been
a sick man, sir, a very sick man.

52:58.291 --> 53:01.158
I cannot recommend
your being up and about.

53:05.432 --> 53:08.367
I had a nightmare. A lot of crazy things.

53:08.969 --> 53:10.197
I slept.

53:10.470 --> 53:12.631
I woke up,
and the room was full of smoke.

53:12.706 --> 53:16.767
I was a sick man.
Instead of pink snakes, I got smoke.

53:17.911 --> 53:21.074
Here I am, all cured.

53:22.415 --> 53:26.351
- What were you saying?
- I made no remark.

53:26.419 --> 53:28.011
Remarks want you to make them.

53:28.088 --> 53:31.080
They got their tongues hanging out
waiting to be said.

53:31.157 --> 53:32.920
I'm Dr. Sonderborg.

53:33.393 --> 53:36.089
You've been suffering
from narcotic poisoning.

53:36.196 --> 53:39.324
On account of you pumped me
full of this poisoning, doc?

53:39.399 --> 53:42.596
Speak up, Dr. Jekyll!
I'm in a wild mood tonight!

53:43.270 --> 53:47.798
I want to go dance in the foam.
I hear the banshees calling.

53:48.441 --> 53:50.773
I haven't shot a man in a week.

53:51.311 --> 53:55.304
You very nearly died, sir.
I had to give you digitalis.

53:55.949 --> 54:00.477
Also a little something to make me talk?
What was I supposed to talk about?

54:00.687 --> 54:02.882
Maybe about a jade necklace
I haven't got?

54:02.956 --> 54:06.084
Was I good telling you
about what I don't have?

54:06.493 --> 54:11.362
Did the customers like me?
Or will Amthor be disappointed in you?

54:13.566 --> 54:15.693
Never disappoint Mr. Amthor.

54:17.037 --> 54:18.698
It depresses him.

54:23.376 --> 54:25.606
You're not well, Mr. Marlowe.

54:26.479 --> 54:30.848
You may collapse at any time.
I must insist upon you going back to bed.

54:31.384 --> 54:33.181
Please give me this.

54:37.390 --> 54:39.187
Now the gun, please.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.389
The gun, please.

54:44.197 --> 54:45.960
I strongly advise...

54:47.334 --> 54:49.928
Tie a ribbon on the one
to the front door, doc.

54:50.003 --> 54:53.461
When you got a gun, people are
supposed to do what you tell them.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.566
I'm afraid you're going
to faint, Mr. Marlowe.

54:56.910 --> 54:58.673
Tie a ribbon on it!

55:09.956 --> 55:12.823
The girls must have a great time with you.

55:35.281 --> 55:37.749
- I'm booked, captain.
- Look, pal, l...

55:37.817 --> 55:39.614
I'm booked, captain.

55:59.272 --> 56:02.901
You ain't in good shape.
You shouldn't ought to fight with me.

56:02.976 --> 56:05.376
- I'll murder you.
- I don't like fighting.

56:05.445 --> 56:09.677
- Maybe you were just making love to me.
- I like you to keep looking for Velma.

56:10.683 --> 56:13.311
You're nuts. You're crazy as a rabbit.

56:14.020 --> 56:17.649
- He sent after me.
- Who? The smart thinker Amthor?

56:18.825 --> 56:22.192
- He was kidding with me.
- He was kidding the pants off of you, son.

56:22.262 --> 56:26.130
He was waving a fish in front of your nose,
so you wouldn't find your gal.

56:26.199 --> 56:30.659
Nobody's supposed to find her.
I think he's got other plans for her.

56:32.605 --> 56:37.406
- You ain't in good shape. I better help you.
- Then get me a cab, you dopey ape.

56:41.915 --> 56:44.509
- Listen!
- I'd like you to take my friend.

56:44.584 --> 56:49.180
Look, I got a fare and I'm on waiting time.
Can't you see the flag is down?

56:52.592 --> 56:55.288
- I'd like you to take my friend.
- Sure.

57:00.100 --> 57:02.159
<i>I said something wrong there. I knew it.</i>

57:02.235 --> 57:04.703
<i>The big stir-bug was</i>
<i>too anxious to get rid of me.</i>

57:04.771 --> 57:06.295
<i>His brain was working.</i>

57:06.372 --> 57:10.832
<i>I don't know what happened to it,</i>
<i>but it was working... at the wrong time.</i>

57:12.078 --> 57:14.842
<i>I wanted to sleep</i>
<i>a couple of hundred years...</i>

57:14.914 --> 57:16.142
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

57:16.216 --> 57:18.548
<i>Nulty was watching my apartment.</i>

57:19.452 --> 57:23.650
<i>So I decided to call on Ann</i>
<i>to find out why she was living alone...</i>

57:24.057 --> 57:26.150
<i>and if she really liked it.</i>

57:46.012 --> 57:49.470
- What do you want?
- Black coffee, eggs, and a scotch and soda.

57:49.549 --> 57:51.642
- Go away.
- Excuse me.

57:58.158 --> 58:00.183
This is a nice place.

58:06.666 --> 58:09.897
But why?
Isn't there room for you in the palace?

58:09.969 --> 58:12.403
An old ballroom or something
you could sleep in?

58:12.472 --> 58:14.804
Or don't you like it out there?

58:19.612 --> 58:22.046
I'm all broke up with cops, honey.

58:22.448 --> 58:25.178
They're hanging all over my place
and at the office.

58:25.251 --> 58:28.778
They may just want to chat,
but I'm not ready for them yet.

58:28.922 --> 58:32.949
- I'll have to live here a couple of days.
- You're drunk. Get out.

58:33.593 --> 58:35.584
That's no way to talk to your loved one...

58:35.662 --> 58:38.529
when he comes home to you
from the brink of the grave.

58:38.598 --> 58:42.329
Helen fixed me a blind date with Amthor
and a couple of his whipping boys.

58:42.402 --> 58:47.237
- What happened? Are you all right?
- He gave me a cute time for three days.

58:47.473 --> 58:50.271
I don't think I'm supposed to be alive...

58:51.244 --> 58:53.439
- Say that again.
- Say what again?

58:53.513 --> 58:55.504
The last thing you said.

58:55.715 --> 58:58.650
I said, "What happened?
Are you all right?"

59:01.621 --> 59:03.316
What's the matter?

59:05.191 --> 59:08.957
Why do you keep looking at me
as if I had a hole in my head?

59:09.629 --> 59:12.826
What were you doing in the canyon
the night Marriott was killed?

59:12.899 --> 59:14.594
I just remember how it happened.

59:14.667 --> 59:17.465
I was lying on my face
because I'd been banged on the head.

59:17.537 --> 59:21.132
Somebody threw a flashlight on me
and asked me, was I all right.

59:21.207 --> 59:24.768
And then she said, "What happened?"
Yeah, it was a girl.

59:25.378 --> 59:29.178
A girl with red hair, a crooked nose,
and a nice figure.

59:29.816 --> 59:32.580
- I didn't kill Marriott.
- You weren't just taking a hike.

59:32.652 --> 59:34.813
You found out
something would happen out there.

59:34.887 --> 59:37.879
Knowing you, I'd say you overheard
Marriott and Helen...

59:37.957 --> 59:40.425
making some sort of arrangements
about the jade.

59:41.527 --> 59:43.654
You knew they had been holding hands.

59:43.730 --> 59:45.561
- You didn't like that.
- I didn't kill him.

59:45.632 --> 59:48.795
You don't like anybody
that has anything to do with Helen.

59:48.868 --> 59:51.496
- Are you trying to reform her?
- I hate her!

59:51.571 --> 59:52.970
That doesn't make sense.

59:53.039 --> 59:57.066
I hate her, but she's married to my father
and she means a great deal to him.

59:57.143 --> 01:00:00.374
I'm fond of my father.
It's more than being fond...

01:00:00.647 --> 01:00:04.947
It's not something you'd understand,
because it doesn't involve money.

01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:08.247
I just don't want anything to hurt him.

01:00:08.488 --> 01:00:10.422
A guy playing around with his wife...

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:12.390
a guy like Marriott: That would hurt him.

01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:15.518
If he killed Marriott, you'd protect him.
It's been done before.

01:00:15.595 --> 01:00:19.053
- There's no age limit on jealous husbands.
- Not Father!

01:00:19.265 --> 01:00:21.460
I don't buy it, either... yet.

01:00:22.635 --> 01:00:26.503
I was just trying it on for size.
A lot of things still don't fit.

01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:31.742
I don't know how you showed up at my
office the next day, making like a reporter.

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:42.180
- Whose handwriting is this?
- I found it on Marriott.

01:00:42.255 --> 01:00:45.782
You went through his pockets?
That took a strong stomach.

01:00:45.858 --> 01:00:48.656
- How'd you like to work for me?
- I'm flattered.

01:00:49.028 --> 01:00:51.826
I'm also tired of you.
And I've got a date. Go home.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:56.130
I can't. There's a little bundle
on my doorstep named Nulty...

01:00:56.202 --> 01:00:58.568
who's playing at not looking like a cop.

01:00:58.638 --> 01:01:00.401
But he's terrible at it.

01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:02.865
Get rid of him.

01:01:02.942 --> 01:01:06.105
Tell him you decided
to have a quiet little supper here with me.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:14.048
- Yes?
- I'd like a word with your boyfriend.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.384
- Well, I really don't...
- Come in, Lieutenant.

01:01:16.456 --> 01:01:17.616
Excuse me.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.158
Thanks to you guys,
my love life's going to pieces.

01:01:20.226 --> 01:01:22.626
I've been looking for you for three days.
Let's go.

01:01:22.695 --> 01:01:26.153
We were sitting down to soft-boiled eggs
and scotch. You wouldn't join us?

01:01:26.232 --> 01:01:28.564
The last time I saw you,
I gave you good advice.

01:01:28.634 --> 01:01:32.570
- I guess it didn't take.
- I didn't bother your little pal Amthor.

01:01:32.638 --> 01:01:35.038
I didn't get around to it. He got to me.

01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:39.307
- He gave me quite a party.
- How did it go?

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.405
What'll it buy me? This is straight.

01:01:43.683 --> 01:01:45.947
You'd like to get Amthor,
I'd like to help you.

01:01:46.018 --> 01:01:49.249
He annoyed me a little.
Let you have it cheap.

01:01:50.156 --> 01:01:52.147
I just get to finish my dinner.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.196
- Okay.
- Come in, Nulty. Make yourself at home.

01:01:59.399 --> 01:02:01.128
Amthor's a tough cookie.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.862
He works some complicated
jewelry routine on gals...

01:02:03.936 --> 01:02:06.370
who come to him
with broken-down libidos.

01:02:06.439 --> 01:02:10.500
- I think Marriott was his contact man.
- Let's get to the new part.

01:02:10.743 --> 01:02:13.769
The jewelry Marriott was buying back
was a jade necklace...

01:02:13.846 --> 01:02:17.577
belonging to one of Amthor's patients,
worth about $100,000.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:22.849
Marriott might've been crossing Amthor.
Anyway, he fumbled the ball.

01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:26.221
- It's a lot of theory. Let's go.
- Amthor figured I picked it up.

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:30.285
He figured wrong. I disappointed him.
I didn't have the jewelry and I didn't talk.

01:02:30.363 --> 01:02:33.423
But he has a little rest home
where you learn to talk.

01:02:34.133 --> 01:02:37.660
It's operated by a guy
who calls himself Dr. Sonderborg.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.528
He's a whiz with a hypo.
It's at 23rd and Descanso.

01:02:45.945 --> 01:02:50.405
- Who owns this jade?
- I told you. One of Amthor's patients.

01:02:50.483 --> 01:02:53.748
- By the name of?
- I don't know.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:57.049
Sorry to bother you, Miss Grayle.

01:02:57.123 --> 01:03:00.456
When were you out last
to your father's place in Brentwood?

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:03.324
Not for several days. Is something wrong?

01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:08.758
I'm buying your information this time.
Don't make a habit of helping me.

01:03:08.835 --> 01:03:11.599
I might get grateful and lock you up.

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:19.208
- How could he know about me?
- I don't know.

01:03:19.345 --> 01:03:22.746
That's what happens when a cop
goes to college. He gets too smart.

01:03:22.815 --> 01:03:26.182
Fix your face.
We're on our way to Buckingham Palace.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.985
What is it?

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.683
It's funny.
About every third day, I get hungry.

01:03:31.757 --> 01:03:34.385
Always have to stop and eat something.

01:03:43.836 --> 01:03:46.270
You haven't got a razor, have you?

01:03:46.339 --> 01:03:50.503
Never mind. I'll have to stop at my place,
anyway. This suit's beginning to crawl.

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:53.670
I think I've got another one
under the mattress.

01:03:55.314 --> 01:03:59.751
- I'm a little beat for this kind of work.
- You know, I think you're nuts.

01:04:00.119 --> 01:04:03.816
You go barging around
without a clear idea of what you're doing.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:06.791
Everybody bats you down,
smacks you over the head...

01:04:06.993 --> 01:04:08.426
fills you full of stuff...

01:04:08.494 --> 01:04:11.691
and you keep right on hitting
between tackle and end.

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:14.858
I don't think you even know
which side you're on.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:19.530
I don't know which side anybody's on.
I don't even know who's playing today.

01:04:19.705 --> 01:04:22.401
Whatever's happening,
you must believe in Father.

01:04:22.475 --> 01:04:24.602
- He's no match for anybody.
- Take it easy.

01:04:24.677 --> 01:04:27.976
Randall probably picked up a scent
leading from Marriott to Helen.

01:04:28.047 --> 01:04:31.847
He may not have reached your father.
Anyway, we'll know soon.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:35.417
Skip the water and make that with scotch.
Save time.

01:04:51.704 --> 01:04:53.797
He must be in his workshop.

01:05:05.117 --> 01:05:06.311
Father.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:11.684
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know. I was frightened.

01:05:12.558 --> 01:05:15.254
- I am frightened.
- The police been here?

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:18.653
- Yes. What's it all about?
- We don't know yet.

01:05:19.065 --> 01:05:20.555
Did they talk to your wife?

01:05:20.633 --> 01:05:24.364
No. She's not been here
since yesterday morning. I thought...

01:05:25.237 --> 01:05:28.502
- Has she been with you?
- What did they have to say?

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:32.368
They seemed interested principally
in our beach house.

01:05:32.445 --> 01:05:35.903
It was rented to Mr. Marriott
indirectly through my bank.

01:05:35.982 --> 01:05:38.348
That probably held up Randall
a couple of days.

01:05:38.417 --> 01:05:41.580
- Okay. Let's have a look at it.
- Don't go to the beach house.

01:05:41.654 --> 01:05:44.248
- Yeah, why not?
- Because it must stop.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:48.350
- The whole thing's gone too far.
- Or maybe it's coming too close?

01:05:48.794 --> 01:05:53.663
I don't say you killed Marriott, but you
could've for a good, old-fashioned motive.

01:05:53.733 --> 01:05:56.463
Look, pop, the cops are moving now.
They're mad.

01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:58.332
They're going to tag somebody.

01:05:58.404 --> 01:06:01.237
As long as I'm on the payroll,
let's understand each other.

01:06:01.307 --> 01:06:03.138
I don't work by push buttons.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:06.144
I stop and I go
but I've got to have reasons.

01:06:07.313 --> 01:06:09.076
Forgive me, Mr. Marlowe.

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:12.242
Forgive me, please.

01:06:13.986 --> 01:06:17.683
It's unnecessary for me to say
I'm an old man. You can see that.

01:06:17.757 --> 01:06:21.215
I only have two interests in life:
My jade and my wife.

01:06:21.861 --> 01:06:24.261
And, of course, my daughter here.

01:06:25.464 --> 01:06:27.864
But my wife's the most important.

01:06:28.334 --> 01:06:31.201
- Do you find her beautiful?
- Why not?

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:34.171
She is beautiful, isn't she? And desirable.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.300
Maybe you think it's improper for an
old man to have a young, desirable wife.

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.808
I've played a little game with myself.

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:47.108
I pretended that she would have
become my wife...

01:06:47.186 --> 01:06:50.087
even if I'd been unable to give her wealth.

01:06:50.656 --> 01:06:52.214
I've enjoyed pretending that.

01:06:52.291 --> 01:06:55.954
It's given me great happiness.
Pride, of course.

01:06:58.564 --> 01:07:02.125
But now I'm losing her. I don't know why.

01:07:02.201 --> 01:07:05.637
I don't understand what's happened.
But I'm losing her.

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:08.903
Ironic that it should be
because of my jade.

01:07:08.974 --> 01:07:11.306
Because of that, a man has died.

01:07:11.677 --> 01:07:16.080
A paltry, foppish man of no consequence,
who's better dead.

01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:19.909
Nevertheless, he's dead
because of my necklace.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.585
I don't know why. But it must stop.

01:07:25.024 --> 01:07:27.754
It must stop, Mr. Marlowe! It must stop!

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.397
What do you want me to do about it?

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:39.632
You must go no further.
The matter must be closed.

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:41.633
I'll pay you well.

01:07:43.075 --> 01:07:46.738
Now this is beginning to make sense
in a screwy sort of way.

01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:50.839
I get dragged in, get money shoved at me.
I get pushed out, get money shoved at me.

01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:53.544
Everybody pushes me in,
everybody pushes me out.

01:07:53.619 --> 01:07:55.917
Nobody wants me to do anything.

01:07:58.224 --> 01:08:00.419
Okay. Put a check in the mail.

01:08:01.761 --> 01:08:06.323
I cost a lot not to do anything.
I get restless. Throw in a trip to Mexico.

01:08:08.067 --> 01:08:10.160
I'll be right back, Father.

01:08:19.812 --> 01:08:23.270
- Have you got a key to the beach house?
- But you said...

01:08:23.381 --> 01:08:27.648
I bowed out. I stopped. He thinks it's over.
That doesn't stop anything.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.554
These things don't work like that.
Okay, so I go hide under the covers.

01:08:31.624 --> 01:08:35.151
Do the police stop?
Does Helen stop? Do you stop?

01:08:35.895 --> 01:08:38.295
- What do you mean, "Does Helen stop?"
- I don't know.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:40.491
If I always knew what I meant,
I'd be a genius.

01:08:40.566 --> 01:08:44.434
But I know this. A cancer doesn't
stop growing just because you ask it to.

01:08:44.502 --> 01:08:49.236
You're vicious. You take some
horrible sort of satisfaction...

01:08:49.308 --> 01:08:51.435
in seeing people torn apart!

01:08:51.777 --> 01:08:54.746
They're headed for it, anyway.
You're headed for it.

01:08:54.814 --> 01:08:57.180
What you're hanging on to will smack you.

01:08:57.249 --> 01:09:00.343
If I fold now, it smacks you later.
I stick, it smacks you sooner.

01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:03.252
But cleaner.
Maybe that's why I'm sticking.

01:09:03.956 --> 01:09:08.221
I don't know, I'd stick anyway.
Because a guy who hired me got killed.

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:12.725
I don't want my kids to think
I had to hit a guy 20 times to kill him.

01:09:13.098 --> 01:09:16.261
I could bust in,
but a key would make it simpler.

01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:20.002
You drive.

01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:46.386
- Is that you?
- Is what me?

01:09:47.066 --> 01:09:49.158
That nice, expensive smell.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:53.502
Quite a lad.

01:10:22.201 --> 01:10:24.294
- Someone's been here.
- Sure.

01:10:26.972 --> 01:10:29.873
That's the first thing Randall does
after a man's murdered.

01:10:29.942 --> 01:10:31.603
Mess up his house.

01:10:36.715 --> 01:10:37.807
Here.

01:10:43.088 --> 01:10:45.386
- Does that prove something?
- No.

01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:48.722
Might have found my name
in the classified section.

01:10:48.794 --> 01:10:50.318
That's what he said he did.

01:10:50.396 --> 01:10:52.864
Or maybe somebody phoned him
and told him about me.

01:10:52.932 --> 01:10:56.459
But you didn't have anything to do
with all this until he came to see you.

01:10:56.535 --> 01:10:58.935
- Or did you?
- I don't know.

01:11:00.372 --> 01:11:03.739
There are a lot of things I don't know.
Some things I'll never know.

01:11:03.809 --> 01:11:06.972
- The only man who can tell me is dead.
- Marriott?

01:11:07.313 --> 01:11:09.804
Yeah. All I can do is keep guessing.

01:11:10.783 --> 01:11:13.650
Let's get out of here
and go guess someplace else.

01:11:13.719 --> 01:11:15.619
All I can do about you is guess.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:20.523
You've only told me you went to the
canyon because you like your father.

01:11:20.592 --> 01:11:22.958
I could guess
you thought he might kill Marriott.

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:26.725
But when you found me out there
in the dirt, you thought I was your father.

01:11:26.799 --> 01:11:30.860
- Please, let's go. I'm awfully tired.
- Okay.

01:11:32.004 --> 01:11:34.529
You know, that's a cute nose,
even if it is crooked.

01:11:34.606 --> 01:11:37.973
It isn't really crooked. It has a bump
where I got hit by a baseball.

01:11:38.043 --> 01:11:39.237
Right there.

01:11:39.311 --> 01:11:42.508
I was playing shortstop
for the 7th grade, and...

01:11:48.587 --> 01:11:50.612
I'm a pretty good guesser.

01:11:51.457 --> 01:11:53.948
Your father really loves Helen.
I can see that.

01:11:54.026 --> 01:11:55.891
Marriott did hurt him.

01:11:56.128 --> 01:11:59.393
When I appeared, you were afraid
I might become another Marriott...

01:11:59.465 --> 01:12:01.160
so you tried to buy me off.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:04.667
That didn't work,
and I began to suspect your father.

01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:09.239
A real tough guesser might say
that when he couldn't buy me off either...

01:12:09.308 --> 01:12:11.503
you decided to be nice to me.

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:14.910
I don't always guess right.
I may be wrong.

01:12:19.318 --> 01:12:21.183
- I think I am wrong.
- Sometimes I hate men.

01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:23.619
All men: Old men, young men...

01:12:24.256 --> 01:12:26.724
beautiful young men who use rose water...

01:12:27.159 --> 01:12:30.060
and almost-heels
who are private detectives!

01:12:33.465 --> 01:12:36.400
I'm sorry, darling. I couldn't help laughing.

01:12:36.635 --> 01:12:39.035
You should know by now
that men play rough.

01:12:39.104 --> 01:12:43.370
They soften you up, throw you off guard,
and then belt you one.

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:48.273
That was a dirty trick. But maybe
it'll teach you not to overplay a good hand.

01:12:48.347 --> 01:12:51.214
It's not that she doesn't like you.
She hates men.

01:12:51.283 --> 01:12:55.276
That was only the first half of the speech.
The rest of it goes like this:

01:12:55.354 --> 01:12:59.154
I hate their women, too,
especially the big-league blondes.

01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:02.658
Beautiful, expensive babes
who know what they've got.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:06.761
All bubble bath and dewy morning
and moonlight...

01:13:07.599 --> 01:13:10.659
and inside, blue-steel cold!

01:13:11.236 --> 01:13:13.932
Cold like that, only not that clean.

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:17.172
Your slip shows, dear.

01:13:23.916 --> 01:13:27.545
Father's worried.
I'll tell him you're here and all right.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.919
- How long have you been here?
- Since yesterday...

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:35.050
Smart. The cops won't be back.
It's a good place to hide.

01:13:35.127 --> 01:13:37.823
You're good at throwing lambs
to the wolves, aren't you?

01:13:37.896 --> 01:13:40.888
Or did you just happen to leave
before the cops dropped in?

01:13:40.966 --> 01:13:45.027
Look, I'd like to get a few things straight.
You hired me to get your necklace.

01:13:45.104 --> 01:13:48.505
You were going to help me, so you
stand me up in a crummy rum joint...

01:13:48.574 --> 01:13:51.702
and tell Amthor pick me up
and shake the necklace out of me.

01:13:51.777 --> 01:13:55.144
- I'm sorry. I thought you had it.
- What gave you that idea?

01:13:55.214 --> 01:13:58.047
Please don't blame me.
You could've had it.

01:13:59.952 --> 01:14:03.479
- Was it bad?
- It almost made me mad.

01:14:03.956 --> 01:14:06.254
How long have you really known Amthor?

01:14:06.558 --> 01:14:09.049
- I don't lie very well, do I?
- Well?

01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:13.061
It's a long story and not very pretty.

01:14:13.132 --> 01:14:15.965
I got lots of time, and I'm not squeamish.

01:14:25.944 --> 01:14:27.969
Amthor is blackmailing me.

01:14:30.215 --> 01:14:33.082
I more or less figured that.
How does it work?

01:14:33.152 --> 01:14:36.849
My husband is 65. He's in love with me.

01:14:37.256 --> 01:14:41.158
I'm fond of him. I'm grateful.
He's been understanding, but...

01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:45.590
I've gone out with other men.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:53.137
- I find men very attractive.
- I imagine they meet you halfway.

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:58.373
When I first knew Marriott, I didn't realize
how close he was to Amthor.

01:14:58.443 --> 01:15:02.243
And it took me a while
to discover just how insidious Amthor is...

01:15:02.848 --> 01:15:05.510
- because he did me a lot of good.
- What kind of good?

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:09.987
He treated my centers of speech.
Really, there's something to it.

01:15:10.055 --> 01:15:14.287
- I have a psychological impediment.
- He did a swell job.

01:15:14.893 --> 01:15:16.918
You talk as good as I do now.

01:15:16.995 --> 01:15:20.692
His system is partly mumbo-jumbo
and partly the real thing.

01:15:20.899 --> 01:15:24.596
He flatters you. He gets into your past.

01:15:24.836 --> 01:15:26.827
You talk and talk and...

01:15:28.674 --> 01:15:32.974
That's the awful way he works:
Uncovering a basis for blackmail.

01:15:33.912 --> 01:15:36.244
Finally, he asked for the jade.

01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:39.576
I agreed. I had no choice.
He knew too much about me.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.182
He threatened to go to my husband.

01:15:42.254 --> 01:15:44.222
Sounds like quite a past.

01:15:45.424 --> 01:15:48.359
A younger man
than my husband might accept it...

01:15:48.427 --> 01:15:51.521
or get drunk or divorce me...

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.264
but he's not young.

01:15:53.365 --> 01:15:55.424
I think it would kill him.

01:16:00.105 --> 01:16:02.596
I couldn't risk it, so I agreed.

01:16:02.674 --> 01:16:05.768
Before I could turn the jade
over to Amthor, it was stolen.

01:16:05.844 --> 01:16:07.607
The man who took it made it clear...

01:16:07.679 --> 01:16:11.274
that if I called the police,
my husband would know everything.

01:16:12.517 --> 01:16:15.315
That makes it an outfit
that knew Amthor's methods...

01:16:15.387 --> 01:16:18.288
or an outfit tipped off
by somebody close to him.

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:21.222
Somebody who knew what he knew.

01:16:21.526 --> 01:16:23.687
- Could've been Marriott.
- I think it was.

01:16:23.762 --> 01:16:28.358
If he had thought Amthor suspected him,
he might have taken you for protection.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:30.324
- Could be.
- I'm sure of it.

01:16:30.402 --> 01:16:32.870
I'm sure Amthor decided
to kill him out there.

01:16:32.938 --> 01:16:36.305
He may even have counted on you
taking the blame.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:38.643
It's rough, but I'll buy it up to there.

01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:42.646
He'd hand your past to your husband
on a platter if you didn't fork over the jade.

01:16:42.714 --> 01:16:46.582
You decided to play ball, but the jade
was stolen with Marriott's help.

01:16:46.985 --> 01:16:49.818
Amthor caught on and killed him.
What happens now?

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:53.222
I want you to help me kill Amthor.

01:16:57.362 --> 01:17:00.058
It's the only way I'll ever have peace.

01:17:00.132 --> 01:17:02.657
Once these things get started,
they go on and on.

01:17:02.734 --> 01:17:05.259
He'll never be satisfied
even if he gets the jade.

01:17:05.337 --> 01:17:08.534
Why me? Because I'm handy
and know how to use a gun?

01:17:08.607 --> 01:17:10.438
Or just because I wear pants?

01:17:10.509 --> 01:17:13.774
Don't say that. Please, I need you so.

01:17:14.513 --> 01:17:15.810
I'm lost.

01:17:16.348 --> 01:17:19.044
I haven't been good, nor halfway good.

01:17:19.351 --> 01:17:22.718
I haven't even been very smart,
but I need help...

01:17:23.322 --> 01:17:24.812
and peace.

01:17:27.092 --> 01:17:28.491
I need you.

01:17:33.532 --> 01:17:36.092
All right. Got anything worked out?

01:17:36.168 --> 01:17:37.965
But I can't find him.

01:17:38.036 --> 01:17:41.267
That's probably my fault.
The cops had a half nelson on me.

01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:44.366
I tossed them Sonderborg.
Amthor may have skipped.

01:17:44.443 --> 01:17:47.810
Even if we find him, we've got to be good
to sell a butcher a steak.

01:17:47.879 --> 01:17:49.403
He works at this stuff.

01:17:49.481 --> 01:17:50.743
Make it simple.

01:17:50.816 --> 01:17:53.444
Tell him you're ready to sell,
that you've got the jade.

01:17:53.518 --> 01:17:54.815
Have I?

01:17:54.886 --> 01:17:56.820
He won't expect you to have it on you.

01:17:56.888 --> 01:18:00.346
He'll need time to get the money.
You name a spot to meet later.

01:18:00.425 --> 01:18:01.619
- For instance?
- Here.

01:18:01.693 --> 01:18:05.424
- What if he sends a stooge?
- We don't play that way. We just wait.

01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:07.429
Okay, he comes. Then what?

01:18:07.833 --> 01:18:09.164
That's my part.

01:18:09.234 --> 01:18:11.930
- All right. I'll dig him up.
- In the morning.

01:18:12.003 --> 01:18:14.836
I'd better get a little work done
before daylight.

01:18:16.408 --> 01:18:18.000
You're wonderful.

01:18:18.577 --> 01:18:21.512
How would you like
not having to earn a living?

01:18:22.314 --> 01:18:25.181
Wouldn't bother me. Got any ideas?

01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:27.778
When will you be back?

01:18:27.853 --> 01:18:30.321
He's slippery. It may not be easy.

01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:32.980
I better not come out till tomorrow night.

01:18:54.579 --> 01:18:56.342
<i>I went in the way I knew about.</i>

01:18:56.415 --> 01:18:58.007
<i>It was simpler...</i>

01:18:58.083 --> 01:19:01.610
<i>and I had a psychological trick</i>
<i>to try out on foxy grandpa.</i>

01:19:02.187 --> 01:19:04.712
<i>I thought it would give him a bang.</i>

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:07.317
<i>I thought it would kill him.</i>

01:19:46.965 --> 01:19:49.661
<i>He wasn't hurt much.</i>
<i>He was just snapped...</i>

01:19:49.734 --> 01:19:52.396
<i>the way a pretty girl</i>
<i>would snap a stalk of celery.</i>

01:19:52.904 --> 01:19:55.668
<i>Only, for this job,</i>
<i>you'd have to be a big man...</i>

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.731
<i>with a big pair of hands.</i>

01:20:36.114 --> 01:20:39.174
I got to find her now. I got to go away.

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:41.219
Sounds like a good idea.

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.183
You might get unpopular
with the police here, breaking guys' necks.

01:20:46.424 --> 01:20:49.916
I know you didn't mean to kill him.
You just shook him too hard.

01:20:49.995 --> 01:20:53.931
You don't know your own strength.
Relax, or I won't be able to help you.

01:20:53.999 --> 01:20:56.433
- You find her?
- Is that your girl?

01:20:58.837 --> 01:21:00.202
That's your girl, isn't it?

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:03.605
That's Velma. It says,
"Always, Velma," doesn't it?

01:21:04.142 --> 01:21:05.769
I don't like nobody to kid with me.

01:21:05.844 --> 01:21:08.404
Nobody's kidding with you.
Somebody's kidding with me.

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:11.413
I thought it was a phony.
I had to make sure.

01:21:11.483 --> 01:21:14.213
That was meant to nip up anybody
who was looking for Velma.

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:17.346
She wasn't like that.
I'll tell you how she was.

01:21:17.889 --> 01:21:18.878
Cute.

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:22.085
Okay, she was as cute as a cap pistol.
She's still cute!

01:21:22.327 --> 01:21:24.795
Do you want to see her
before you go away?

01:21:25.497 --> 01:21:26.987
You mean you find her now?

01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:29.533
Yeah, I find her. Just now.

01:21:29.668 --> 01:21:32.296
- She's okay?
- Depends on what you got in mind.

01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:34.770
- She's doing all right?
- That depends, too.

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.240
Did you tip the johns off on her?

01:21:37.609 --> 01:21:40.476
I wouldn't want Velma to serve no stretch.

01:21:41.246 --> 01:21:44.238
What stretch?
You two mixed up in something together?

01:21:44.549 --> 01:21:46.517
You tipped the johns off. They got her.

01:21:46.585 --> 01:21:48.382
Listen to me, and stop dancing with me.

01:21:48.453 --> 01:21:51.115
The johns haven't got her.
She's got herself.

01:21:52.257 --> 01:21:54.122
She wants to talk to you.

01:21:54.726 --> 01:21:57.752
Of course, things have changed a little
in eight years.

01:21:57.829 --> 01:21:59.854
- Okay.
- Tomorrow.

01:22:02.133 --> 01:22:04.727
I'd like to pay you some more
for finding her.

01:22:08.106 --> 01:22:09.368
Skip it.

01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:12.503
Here. Grab yourself a hamburger
and lay low.

01:22:12.577 --> 01:22:15.205
See you here tomorrow
as soon as it gets dark.

01:22:29.327 --> 01:22:31.124
- You got that?
- Yeah.

01:22:31.496 --> 01:22:34.693
- What do you do?
- I wait here. Then I come up.

01:22:34.766 --> 01:22:36.290
When do you come up?

01:22:37.135 --> 01:22:38.625
You open the window.

01:22:38.937 --> 01:22:41.531
I open the curtains. You'll see the light.

01:22:41.606 --> 01:22:44.666
I've got to get set, so don't jump the gun.
Don't move.

01:22:44.743 --> 01:22:46.608
I'll leave the door open.

01:22:48.947 --> 01:22:52.439
<i>That was like lighting a stick of dynamite</i>
<i>and telling it not to go off.</i>

01:22:52.517 --> 01:22:54.348
<i>But I had to know one more thing.</i>

01:22:54.419 --> 01:22:56.546
<i>I had to know how the jade figured.</i>

01:23:30.221 --> 01:23:31.654
You're trembling.

01:23:31.723 --> 01:23:34.248
I was afraid something had happened.

01:23:34.726 --> 01:23:35.954
Did you find Amthor?

01:23:36.027 --> 01:23:38.552
He's gone undercover.
He'll be here around 12:00.

01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:41.064
Let's get set. What's the program?

01:23:41.299 --> 01:23:43.767
Pull the curtains and turn on the lights.

01:24:10.195 --> 01:24:13.062
You told Amthor
you'd have it for him, didn't you?

01:24:18.837 --> 01:24:20.532
Don't you like it?

01:24:21.406 --> 01:24:22.873
I don't know.

01:24:23.074 --> 01:24:26.134
I've never seen a necklace
worth $100,000 before.

01:24:28.179 --> 01:24:29.271
Where'd you get it?

01:24:29.347 --> 01:24:31.872
Lower left-hand drawer
of my dressing table.

01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:33.440
It was never stolen?

01:24:34.619 --> 01:24:36.746
There wasn't any holdup?

01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:38.755
You faked the whole thing.

01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:42.485
I wasn't going to let him get it.
It would have just whetted his appetite.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.755
I'm not going to let him get it now.

01:24:45.029 --> 01:24:47.896
We'll just let him look at it.
He'll start quibbling...

01:24:47.966 --> 01:24:50.594
Last time, he tossed his gun at me.
Maybe he'll shoot it.

01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:52.363
He'll never get that far.

01:24:52.437 --> 01:24:54.268
Let's not talk about it now.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:57.502
It's really quite simple.
And then this is yours.

01:24:58.409 --> 01:25:01.845
You're much too nice
to be a grubby detective all your life.

01:25:03.615 --> 01:25:06.482
You told Marriott
this thing had been stolen. Why?

01:25:06.618 --> 01:25:10.611
It had to look real. They had to believe
it actually had been stolen.

01:25:10.688 --> 01:25:12.815
I had to pretend to buy it back.

01:25:12.891 --> 01:25:15.553
- Marriott fell for that?
- Yes. Why not?

01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:20.889
I didn't really like him.

01:25:21.132 --> 01:25:22.724
He wasn't any good.

01:25:23.168 --> 01:25:26.137
But remembering
does something to my stomach.

01:25:26.337 --> 01:25:28.532
You still think Amthor killed him?

01:25:28.773 --> 01:25:30.138
Who else?

01:25:31.843 --> 01:25:33.003
You.

01:25:33.812 --> 01:25:34.904
No.

01:25:36.881 --> 01:25:38.872
No, you can't mean that.

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:45.147
Why?

01:25:45.256 --> 01:25:47.417
I think the picture was a little different.

01:25:47.492 --> 01:25:51.690
Marriott was scared because he'd agreed
to help you kill a nosy detective...

01:25:52.463 --> 01:25:54.693
the one Mrs. Florian phoned him about.

01:25:54.766 --> 01:25:56.961
He had to help you to protect his interest.

01:25:57.035 --> 01:25:58.263
You knew that.

01:25:58.336 --> 01:26:00.827
You belonged to him, and to Amthor...

01:26:00.905 --> 01:26:04.033
and to Mrs. Florian, in her modest way.
You supported them.

01:26:04.642 --> 01:26:06.769
They didn't want me cutting in, either.

01:26:06.845 --> 01:26:10.281
You wouldn't be worth blackmailing
if I'd found you for Moose.

01:26:10.615 --> 01:26:12.276
He might even have hurt you.

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:15.148
And if Marriott hadn't been scared silly...

01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:19.213
he'd have realized you were pushing
us both in the corner. Nifty thinking.

01:26:19.757 --> 01:26:22.624
One of us would get out of the car.
Didn't matter which.

01:26:22.694 --> 01:26:25.094
Either way, you had us separated.

01:26:25.363 --> 01:26:28.764
Then you'd tag us one at a time
and get Amthor later.

01:26:33.872 --> 01:26:36.500
It might have worked, too,
if it hadn't been for Ann.

01:26:36.574 --> 01:26:40.476
But my head's pretty hard, and killing
a man with a sap is no work for a lady.

01:26:40.545 --> 01:26:42.069
Please don't!

01:26:42.547 --> 01:26:44.071
It's all true.

01:26:44.215 --> 01:26:47.446
Suddenly, I was trapped.
Everybody was closing in on me.

01:26:47.518 --> 01:26:51.147
- I didn't know what I was doing!
- You almost did it anyway.

01:26:51.222 --> 01:26:54.885
- I almost ended up as dead as Marriott.
- I didn't know what you'd do!

01:26:54.959 --> 01:26:56.824
I can't go back now.

01:26:57.395 --> 01:27:00.330
I'm so close to peace, so close.

01:27:00.999 --> 01:27:02.523
Just Amthor.

01:27:03.167 --> 01:27:05.226
But I can't face it alone.

01:27:05.737 --> 01:27:07.568
Don't desert me now.

01:27:07.939 --> 01:27:10.407
Sorry. It won't work twice.

01:27:13.778 --> 01:27:16.474
It's a good technique,
but it won't work twice.

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.946
I don't count the first time,
eight years ago.

01:27:19.017 --> 01:27:21.747
You were just learning.
Moose was in love with you.

01:27:21.819 --> 01:27:23.844
I don't know what you talked him into.

01:27:23.922 --> 01:27:26.447
Was it murder or something serious?

01:27:27.825 --> 01:27:31.352
You almost had me, sister,
because you almost told me the truth.

01:27:31.462 --> 01:27:35.626
Sure, Amthor's blackmailing you,
but you didn't give me the right reason.

01:27:35.867 --> 01:27:38.802
It wasn't just men.
Pop understood the men.

01:27:39.437 --> 01:27:42.133
That was part of the setup:
An understanding grandpa.

01:27:43.308 --> 01:27:45.105
It was the clink coming up.

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:47.804
It's no good understanding the clink.

01:27:48.012 --> 01:27:50.378
You still don't get silk sheets.

01:27:50.782 --> 01:27:52.147
Don't do that.

01:27:53.651 --> 01:27:56.415
I've kept forgetting to tell you...

01:27:56.487 --> 01:27:59.456
that you shouldn't kiss a girl
when you're wearing that gun.

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:01.287
It leaves a bruise.

01:28:02.193 --> 01:28:03.592
I'll try to remember that.

01:28:03.661 --> 01:28:05.151
I could like you.

01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:07.964
I could like you a lot.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:11.095
It's too bad it has to be like this.

01:28:14.839 --> 01:28:15.965
Don't move.

01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:19.471
Come in.

01:28:24.415 --> 01:28:27.578
Your sense of timing, dear,
gets worse and worse.

01:28:27.819 --> 01:28:31.186
I'm to blame. I insisted on coming.
I was worried.

01:28:31.255 --> 01:28:35.282
Why didn't you tell me
you were in such serious trouble?

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.884
I wanted to spare you.

01:28:36.961 --> 01:28:39.691
I might have been able
to help prevent all this.

01:28:40.999 --> 01:28:42.933
Now, of course, it's too late.

01:28:43.868 --> 01:28:45.392
Mr. Amthor's coming.

01:28:46.504 --> 01:28:49.632
I think, perhaps, you'd better do it quickly.

01:28:54.679 --> 01:28:56.169
Get his gun.

01:28:58.016 --> 01:29:02.715
This'll be the first time I've killed anyone
I knew so little and liked so well.

01:29:03.921 --> 01:29:05.513
What's your first name?

01:29:05.656 --> 01:29:07.123
Philip, for short.

01:29:08.359 --> 01:29:11.157
Philip Marlowe. A name for a duke.

01:29:12.230 --> 01:29:14.095
And you're just a nice mug.

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:18.558
I've got a name for a duchess:
Mrs. Lewin Lockridge Grayle.

01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:21.228
Just a couple of mugs.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.571
We could have got along.

01:29:24.642 --> 01:29:28.373
What's stopping us now?
I can handle Moose. He's in love with you.

01:29:28.446 --> 01:29:31.438
He broke Amthor's neck
because he's in love with you.

01:29:36.387 --> 01:29:37.752
Then that leaves only you.

01:29:37.822 --> 01:29:40.382
I don't want to do anything
about you now. I know enough.

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:42.153
You know too much.

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.150
It's gone too far...

01:29:45.897 --> 01:29:47.296
and I'm so tired.

01:30:09.454 --> 01:30:11.046
Let's have the police.

01:30:12.190 --> 01:30:14.488
Don't you realize he saved your life?

01:30:14.559 --> 01:30:17.221
Why must he suffer for that?
Why must he suffer more?

01:30:17.295 --> 01:30:19.661
The cops like to solve murders
done with my gun.

01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:21.630
She's dead. Isn't that enough?

01:30:21.699 --> 01:30:23.530
She was evil, all evil.

01:30:23.601 --> 01:30:26.399
What difference can it possibly make
who killed her?

01:30:31.976 --> 01:30:34.706
You don't call me. I hear it, so I come up.

01:30:38.583 --> 01:30:40.710
I'd like to talk to Velma now.

01:30:41.552 --> 01:30:43.952
It didn't work out
the way I planned, Moose.

01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:47.514
You got a refund coming.

01:30:59.804 --> 01:31:01.829
She ain't hardly changed.

01:31:02.673 --> 01:31:04.436
Just like always...

01:31:05.476 --> 01:31:07.171
only more fancy.

01:31:08.179 --> 01:31:12.081
Cute as lace pants... always.

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:16.744
I wasn't going to bother her none
if she done all right.

01:31:17.388 --> 01:31:19.618
It was the only thing I could do.

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:22.719
You must try and understand.

01:31:23.794 --> 01:31:25.489
I couldn't let her go.

01:31:26.264 --> 01:31:27.925
I loved her too much.

01:31:28.933 --> 01:31:30.867
You shouldn't have killed her.

01:31:32.003 --> 01:31:35.336
- You shouldn't have killed Velma.
- Moose, listen to me!

01:31:50.555 --> 01:31:54.616
<i>That old black pit opened up again,</i>
<i>right on schedule.</i>

01:31:54.892 --> 01:31:57.417
<i>It was blacker than the others, and deeper.</i>

01:31:57.728 --> 01:31:59.753
<i>I didn't expect to hit bottom.</i>

01:32:00.164 --> 01:32:02.359
<i>I thought I was full of lead.</i>

01:32:04.068 --> 01:32:05.660
That's all I know.

01:32:06.103 --> 01:32:09.129
On account of I don't see so well
with my eyeballs scorched.

01:32:10.208 --> 01:32:13.609
I heard the shots. I didn't fire them.
Don't know who got hit.

01:32:15.746 --> 01:32:18.408
It wasn't the kid, was it? It wasn't Ann?

01:32:19.684 --> 01:32:20.810
Randall!

01:32:20.885 --> 01:32:22.910
He'll be back in a minute.

01:32:24.355 --> 01:32:26.983
How soon do I get
to take these wrappings off, Nulty?

01:32:27.058 --> 01:32:29.788
A couple months, if you live that long.

01:32:39.036 --> 01:32:41.971
- You mean I'm sprung?
- Get out of here and out of my hair.

01:32:42.039 --> 01:32:44.269
I'll have the statement
for you to sign tomorrow.

01:32:44.342 --> 01:32:45.832
Who backed me up?

01:32:47.812 --> 01:32:49.643
Who got shot? I heard three.

01:32:49.714 --> 01:32:51.011
- Malloy.
- Dead?

01:32:51.082 --> 01:32:52.811
Yeah. And Grayle.

01:32:52.883 --> 01:32:55.511
He didn't go down right away.
They fought for the gun.

01:32:55.586 --> 01:32:57.713
Grayle got the third slug himself.

01:32:58.856 --> 01:33:00.380
The kid's okay, then.

01:33:01.626 --> 01:33:04.595
She thought it over
and came around to back me up, right?

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:06.095
I didn't say.

01:33:06.731 --> 01:33:08.221
She here now?

01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:12.261
No. Okay, Nulty. See that he gets home.

01:33:13.738 --> 01:33:15.706
You give going-away presents here?

01:33:15.773 --> 01:33:18.298
That's yours.
She gave it to you, didn't she?

01:33:18.876 --> 01:33:21.242
She was going to,
but I didn't finish the job.

01:33:21.312 --> 01:33:24.213
Anyway, I tried it on.
It's wrong for my complexion.

01:33:24.715 --> 01:33:26.808
What am I supposed to do with it?

01:33:26.884 --> 01:33:29.717
Give it to your girlfriend.
Give it back to China.

01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:32.220
Strangle yourself with it! I don't care.

01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:37.389
What do you know about that redhead,
pitching for me.

01:33:37.728 --> 01:33:40.822
- How'd she take it about the old man?
- I wouldn't know.

01:33:42.633 --> 01:33:44.066
Cute figure, huh?

01:33:45.236 --> 01:33:48.034
- I didn't notice.
- You must be low on vitamins.

01:33:51.442 --> 01:33:54.411
- She had more than a figure, too.
- Watch your step.

01:33:55.313 --> 01:33:57.713
Not a beautiful face, but a good face.

01:33:57.782 --> 01:33:59.807
A face like a Sunday school picnic.

01:33:59.884 --> 01:34:03.513
- You know what kind of a face that is?
- I wouldn't know.

01:34:04.555 --> 01:34:07.023
It's too bad I had to push her around.

01:34:07.358 --> 01:34:10.259
I wonder how she figured me.
Not much, probably.

01:34:10.961 --> 01:34:13.589
Maybe she thought
I liked that blonde chewing on my face.

01:34:13.664 --> 01:34:15.427
Probably thought there was more.

01:34:16.834 --> 01:34:18.358
I'd like to tell her.

01:34:18.703 --> 01:34:21.433
No, there wouldn't be
much percentage in that, would there?

01:34:21.505 --> 01:34:24.167
I wouldn't know. Hey, cab.

01:34:28.012 --> 01:34:29.639
Watch your head.

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:33.281
- 1800 South Kingsley.
- Right.

01:34:50.468 --> 01:34:53.232
She made swell coffee, anyway.

01:34:54.438 --> 01:34:55.564
Nulty.

01:34:56.507 --> 01:34:59.032
I haven't kissed anybody in a long time.

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:01.738
Would it be all right if I kissed you, Nulty?

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:24.101
English

01:35:25.305 --> 01:35:31.902
