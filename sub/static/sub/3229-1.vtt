<i>Dad.</i>

01:09.760 --> 01:12.161
<i>I've gone to the city.</i>

01:12.320 --> 01:15.403
<i>Please don't come for me.</i>

01:15.560 --> 01:20.327
There's a curfew here.
Just... just keep them safe.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.004
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:26.600 --> 01:28.329
<i>I love you.</i>

01:35.840 --> 01:38.923
<i>You are listening to NPR.
I'm host, David Newborn,</i>

01:39.080 --> 01:42.880
<i>and this is Global Position.
Now for today's top headlines.</i>

01:43.080 --> 01:45.128
<i>Months after the initial
worldwide outbreak,</i>

01:45.280 --> 01:47.726
<i>national and local governments
are beginning to suppress</i>

01:47.920 --> 01:50.241
<i>the necroambulis virus epidemic.</i>

01:50.400 --> 01:54.485
<i>The Department of Agriculture has found
no solution for infected, dying crops.</i>

01:54.640 --> 01:57.803
<i>Agriculture Officials are encouraging
farmers to burn their crops</i>

01:57.960 --> 02:00.964
<i>in a desperate attempt to destroy
what may be preventing growth.</i>

02:03.640 --> 02:05.927
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

02:06.080 --> 02:08.048
<i>Curfew is at 8:00.</i>

02:14.080 --> 02:15.520
<i>While citizens of inner cities</i>

02:15.640 --> 02:17.847
<i>and metropolitan areas
remain hardest hit,</i>

02:18.000 --> 02:19.889
<i>through quick response and quarantine,</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:22.247
<i>weekly infections reports
have dropped 30%.</i>

02:29.160 --> 02:32.243
<i>Cleanup and martial law
are still in effect.</i>

02:32.400 --> 02:34.971
<i>Medical officials,
along with the CDC,</i>

02:35.120 --> 02:37.771
<i>have been tight-lipped
about a cure or vaccine.</i>

02:43.520 --> 02:46.967
<i>As for the infected,
scientists are now suggesting</i>

02:47.120 --> 02:50.010
<i>that an elevated sense of smell
is the telltale sign</i>

02:50.160 --> 02:53.767
<i>of what's being referred to
as "the turn."</i>

03:42.760 --> 03:45.570
Check this one for infection.
Look at that skin.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.290
Yeah, we caught another, 10-4.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.842
- Curfew-breaker. See if infected, over.
- Get her here.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.410
<i>Doctors with stage
three patients are reminded</i>

04:18.560 --> 04:22.246
<i>quarantine pickup is at 1700 hours.</i>

04:31.120 --> 04:32.849
Sir? You shouldn't be in here.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.168
This is the shelter
for the infected. It's dangerous.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.209
But my daughter is here.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.370
- What's her name?
- Maggie.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.205
Marguerite.
Marguerite Vogel.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.522
Marguerite Vogel...

04:56.000 --> 04:57.684
Mr. Vogel?

04:58.880 --> 05:01.451
Your daughter's bite wound
was very severe.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.961
Now, we may know a lot about this,

05:06.120 --> 05:08.646
except that we can't stop this yet.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.730
She's probably going to show
more signs of aggression.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.881
She's gonna lose her appetite,
and then she's gonna get it back again.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.209
Look at me.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.966
When that happens,
take her to quarantine.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.841
I wouldn't normally release
someone with her type infection.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.082
I'm doing this
as a favor for Vern.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.129
Quarantine is eight weeks in.

05:34.280 --> 05:37.648
Say your goodbyes and
get her straight to Blaire.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.041
I'll send all the necessary
paperwork to Vern.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.522
He'll follow up and answer
any questions you have.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.044
Good luck, Mr. Vogel.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.686
Dad? Dad!

06:18.200 --> 06:21.682
- I'm sorry.
- I've been searching everywhere for you.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.320
I'm sorry.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.204
What did he say?

06:40.920 --> 06:42.331
The doctor?

06:46.320 --> 06:48.129
Vern helped us get you out.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.924
Stop picking at it!

07:08.320 --> 07:10.049
- Where are you going?
- Inside.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.204
- Mag.
- I'll be fine.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.563
Hello?

08:30.120 --> 08:31.724
Hello?

09:33.400 --> 09:37.405
Maggie? Maggie?
Get in the truck!

09:37.560 --> 09:41.451
- What's wrong?
- Just do it right now. Come on. Go.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.361
Mom! Daddy's home!

11:00.680 --> 11:03.729
Slow down, honey! Oh!

11:03.880 --> 11:06.087
- Did you pack your bag?
- Mm-hm.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.005
- Is Pretty Pony going?
- Mm...

11:09.160 --> 11:12.243
You're not taking Pretty Pony?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.162
- Got everything you need?
- Yeah.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.726
Daddy!

11:33.920 --> 11:37.481
We missed you.

11:37.640 --> 11:41.201
- It's so good to see you.
- Hey. Hey, Moll.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.408
What happened to your arm?

11:43.560 --> 11:45.005
Oh, uh...

11:47.040 --> 11:49.407
I just got hurt.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.443
I scratched mine,

11:52.600 --> 11:55.171
but Mommy fixed it.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.761
- Who fixed yours?
- Uh, the doctors.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.651
Is that where you were?

12:00.800 --> 12:03.770
Yeah. it took
a while for them to fix it.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.405
I missed you.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.766
Dad said you were sick...

12:59.960 --> 13:02.770
but you're dying, huh?

13:04.120 --> 13:05.849
Bobby...

13:09.480 --> 13:11.881
A few kids at my school
got infected.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.169
I knew one of them. Steven.

13:16.880 --> 13:21.841
I didn't like him much,
but... I don't think he deserved to die.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.445
Does it hurt?

13:29.600 --> 13:33.446
No. Not anymore.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.768
Why do we have to stay
with Aunt Linda?

13:48.240 --> 13:50.208
Because I'm contagious.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.121
Mom's afraid we'll get it.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.728
Just because she loves you.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.570
Hey. Go on,
and be nice to Molly.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.683
Bobby?

14:11.840 --> 14:16.243
- I missed you, kiddo.
- Missed you, too.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.769
Ready?

14:53.840 --> 14:56.081
<i>They tell us that
patients have days left</i>

14:56.240 --> 14:59.961
<i>before what
they're considering the final stage.</i>

15:00.120 --> 15:04.967
<i>And stay tuned at the top of the hour.
We'll be in conversation...</i>

15:05.120 --> 15:08.567
Why don't you get settled
and help me with the dishes?

16:11.240 --> 16:13.402
Caroline is fixing us
something to eat.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.847
I'm not hungry.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.808
Allie called a few times.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.883
Two weeks?

16:56.920 --> 17:00.208
You spent two weeks
out there looking for me?

17:06.280 --> 17:07.724
Yeah.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.767
I made a promise to your mother...

17:15.920 --> 17:17.843
that I would protect you.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.089
Yeah, but...
what about you guys?

17:25.240 --> 17:29.802
- What if I hurt you?
- Don't worry.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.884
Caroline and I,
we know the precautions.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.731
You shouldn't
have brought me back.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.404
You have to eat something.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.605
For me.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.086
I'll try.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.841
Maggie?
Where are your bandages?

18:30.400 --> 18:32.562
I'm so glad I came down.

18:40.360 --> 18:44.001
I know, I know. I...

18:44.160 --> 18:46.686
I just can't look at it.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.764
I can't see it, knowing what's
going to happen to her.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.083
I just can't do it, Wade. I'm...

18:53.240 --> 18:54.924
I'm Sorry.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.881
I just don't understand. I...

19:15.040 --> 19:18.010
I keep asking Him and asking Him,

19:18.160 --> 19:21.881
but... He's not giving me any answers.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.850
Wade?

20:09.440 --> 20:11.807
<i>- You've reached Fred and...
- Ken.</i>

20:11.960 --> 20:14.122
<i>And we're out on the farm.</i>

20:14.280 --> 20:16.681
<i>Leave us a message
and we'll get back to you.</i>

20:16.840 --> 20:18.968
<i>Oh, that was awful.</i>

20:19.120 --> 20:21.043
<i>That was pretty funny, though.</i>

21:54.520 --> 21:57.400
<i>What do you
think about the schools opening up?</i>

21:57.480 --> 21:59.164
<i>No, you need to stop pretending</i>

21:59.320 --> 22:00.890
<i>bad things ain't happening out there.</i>

22:01.040 --> 22:02.201
<i>Bad things?</i>

22:25.280 --> 22:28.284
<i>Well now,
as the government sanction...</i>

22:29.440 --> 22:32.762
<i>...people are ID 'ed in the system
and sent home with families.</i>

22:32.920 --> 22:35.280
<i>They even have forced appointments
with their local doctors,</i>

22:35.320 --> 22:37.891
<i>who report back
to the hospitals in the cities.</i>

22:38.080 --> 22:39.680
<i>And if they violate their allotted time,</i>

22:39.760 --> 22:41.171
<i>the authorities come to get them.</i>

22:41.320 --> 22:43.800
<i>And how long does it take to turn?</i>

22:43.960 --> 22:45.644
<i>How long is that allotted time?</i>

22:45.840 --> 22:48.241
<i>They say six to eight weeks
for any one person to turn.</i>

22:48.400 --> 22:52.200
<i>But, well, we know it's different
depending on who you are.</i>

22:52.360 --> 22:53.964
<i>And what if someone turned early?</i>

22:54.120 --> 22:56.964
<i>I mean, how many people
they gonna hurt...</i>

23:04.520 --> 23:06.170
Maggie!

23:08.360 --> 23:10.408
No. No.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.131
<i>You don't
do that and then leave.</i>

23:13.280 --> 23:15.240
<i>You don't send half of them
home to their families</i>

23:15.360 --> 23:16.691
<i>and hope they come back to be killed.</i>

23:16.840 --> 23:18.171
<i>You just kill them. That's all.</i>

23:20.360 --> 23:23.125
Mag! Are you okay?

23:25.480 --> 23:28.051
Your finger!

23:30.920 --> 23:33.321
Come on, I've got you.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.210
Here, sweetie. Sit down.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.123
- Caroline?
- Let's see what I have.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.201
I'll call our doctor.

23:59.280 --> 24:03.365
Yes, it's Mrs. Vogel.
Caroline Vogel.

24:03.520 --> 24:07.320
Yes, I'm... I'm calling
about my stepdaughter.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.004
It's urgent.

24:26.440 --> 24:30.411
It's an emergency.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.250
Get behind me.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.449
Nathan.

25:54.600 --> 25:58.161
No, don't!
Please, Dad. No. Please!

25:58.320 --> 26:02.086
Go home. Just go home.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.084
Please, say something.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.689
Nathan, please.

27:19.840 --> 27:23.287
I asked him to say something.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.125
Maggie used to babysit for her.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.887
It had to be done.
Ain't nobody fighting that.

27:30.080 --> 27:34.529
Bonnie was wrong
for what she done.

27:34.680 --> 27:35.966
Was she?

27:36.120 --> 27:39.169
She kept them in the house
and didn't notify anybody.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.051
She should have brought
them into quarantine.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.567
We had damn near the
whole station out there.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.245
Now we can't
even find Bonnie.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.690
Look, Wade.
When the time comes...

27:55.840 --> 27:58.923
- Now, Ray...
- I know.

27:59.080 --> 28:03.881
I know what you're thinking,
but... it's for the best.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.080
You think about what those
two could have done today

28:06.200 --> 28:08.931
if you hadn't have been out there.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.760
Quarantine rules apply
to everybody, Wade.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.531
- I mean, wake up! Look at the...
- Holt!

28:13.680 --> 28:15.284
Go call the trucks down from Owensboro.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.522
Tell them we've got
two bodies to clean up.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.487
Holt.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.407
Unbelievable.

28:26.600 --> 28:31.401
Now, Ray, you and I,
we go back a long ways.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.329
You've always done us right,

28:34.520 --> 28:37.842
especially after Sarah's passing.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.367
But I swear to God,

28:40.520 --> 28:43.490
if you, him, or anyone else
come out here for her...

28:43.640 --> 28:46.007
She's my daughter, Ray.

28:52.800 --> 28:57.044
Trucks will be down here
in the morning, pick up the remains.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.481
Wade...

29:07.680 --> 29:10.365
Think about what
you had to do today,

29:10.560 --> 29:13.245
what you might have
to do in the future.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.369
How is she?

29:42.840 --> 29:45.320
She asleep?

29:45.480 --> 29:48.529
Her finger is gone.
She made sure of that.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.404
I got it all bandaged up,

29:50.600 --> 29:54.924
but she's still refusing
to go to the doctor.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.242
I figured that.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.923
What did Ray say?

30:02.080 --> 30:05.562
He said that Bonnie
kept them locked up for a while.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.609
Too long.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.245
I killed them both.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.449
No. You, uh...

30:14.600 --> 30:16.648
They'd already moved on.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.686
- There was something in their eyes.
- Wade.

30:21.880 --> 30:25.487
You can't do this to yourself.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.405
Bonnie should have taken them in.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.368
And what about Mag?

30:34.680 --> 30:36.489
What happens when she gets close?

30:36.640 --> 30:39.928
Don't think about that right now.

30:40.080 --> 30:44.688
Just... just...

30:46.920 --> 30:50.288
Let's enjoy the time we have with her.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.531
- What is it?
- Shh.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.324
Wade?

31:32.880 --> 31:34.564
Stay here.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.689
Bonnie?

32:06.320 --> 32:08.049
It's late.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.164
How's Mag?

32:20.120 --> 32:22.600
About as good as she can be.

32:30.400 --> 32:34.086
Doctors gave us
all these special rules

32:34.240 --> 32:38.086
and papers for children
with her condition.

32:39.800 --> 32:43.247
"Lock subject in room at night.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.489
"Avoid touching subject
without gloves."

32:46.640 --> 32:49.689
Never once said her name.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.320
Julia.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.727
She's just four.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.201
She was scared.

33:04.360 --> 33:07.921
She slept with us most nights
as it was, so we'd...

33:10.320 --> 33:12.800
We'd take turns
with her through nights.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.082
She got worse.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.571
One night Nathan went in,

33:23.720 --> 33:27.441
didn't wake me for my turn.
Next morning, door was locked.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.730
Locked himself in with her.

33:32.880 --> 33:37.044
I pounded and pounded
on that damn door,

33:37.240 --> 33:40.767
cried till I couldn't no more.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.766
Still, never answered.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.562
But he knew.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.688
He knew what he was doing.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.971
Take me to where they're at.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.723
Dad!
There's someone on the phone.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.088
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Vogel?</i>

39:47.280 --> 39:50.409
- Yes?
<i>- Yes. Hello, sir. This is Mr. Garmen</i>

39:50.560 --> 39:53.291
<i>from the quarantine unit
of St. Mary's Hospital.</i>

39:53.440 --> 39:56.649
<i>We're calling to inform you that
we've scheduled a follow up appointment</i>

39:56.800 --> 39:59.804
<i>with Dr. Vern Kaplan to track
your daughter's progress</i>

40:00.000 --> 40:02.321
<i>in advance of quarantine.</i>

40:05.840 --> 40:09.083
Tomorrow we're
gonna go and see Vern about your finger.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.767
No arguments.
You hear me?

40:43.840 --> 40:46.730
James, Carrie,
get over here.

40:46.920 --> 40:49.207
Right now!

40:49.360 --> 40:51.442
Come here, sit by Mama.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.522
Wade.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.331
- Vern.
- Maggie.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.682
Take a deep breath for me.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.444
Let it out.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.647
Lungs are clear.

41:32.840 --> 41:36.049
Scans show that the asthma
has receded already,

41:36.200 --> 41:38.806
and your heartbeat
is abnormally strong.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.406
That's a good sign.

41:43.720 --> 41:47.566
Now... let's have a look at your arm.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.364
Looks like the origin site
is spreading.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.811
Maggie, what happened here?

42:05.000 --> 42:08.561
- She broke it.
- I cut it off.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.404
Why would you
do such a thing?

42:10.560 --> 42:13.370
What good's a finger
if your arm's falling off?

42:13.520 --> 42:16.285
Maggie, your arm
is not going to fall off.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.920
Now, there's a lot we don't
know about this thing,

42:19.080 --> 42:23.802
but this decay, it'll stop.

42:23.960 --> 42:28.329
Your arm is yours to keep.
You got me?

42:28.520 --> 42:30.648
I'm gonna take
a sample, okay?

42:32.560 --> 42:34.688
Allie's been asking about you.

42:34.840 --> 42:39.050
Said she tried
to call a few times.

42:39.240 --> 42:42.210
I know she'd love
to hear from you, so...

42:42.360 --> 42:45.330
give her a call, okay?

42:45.480 --> 42:47.050
Doctor's orders.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.481
All right, all done.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.048
All we gotta do now
is put a dressing on it.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.363
I'll have Judy come in
and take care of that.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.563
There you are.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.361
She's strong,

43:49.560 --> 43:51.449
but from what I've seen,

43:51.600 --> 43:53.489
it's progressing fast in her.

43:53.640 --> 43:58.487
Pretty soon,
she ain't gonna want any food.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.246
She's gonna want something more.

44:01.400 --> 44:05.325
Skin will start smelling like meat.

44:05.480 --> 44:08.450
When it finally happens,
you're gonna have a few choices.

44:09.640 --> 44:13.281
One, take her to quarantine.

44:13.440 --> 44:16.171
I'm not gonna do that.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.243
I wasn't suggesting it.

44:18.400 --> 44:21.051
My report will say
she's progressing slow,

44:21.200 --> 44:23.407
so it'll buy you some time.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.609
Option two:

44:26.760 --> 44:30.048
We give her the cocktail
they'd give her in quarantine.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.601
At least this way she'd be
with you when she takes it,

44:32.760 --> 44:36.367
and not a bunch of strangers
or other infected people.

44:37.640 --> 44:41.850
But you know how she doesn't
feel anything right now?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.844
She will feel this.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.449
Reports say that it's painful.

44:49.600 --> 44:50.886
Extremely.

44:51.080 --> 44:54.129
All the way up till the end.

44:55.880 --> 44:57.689
What's option three?

44:59.840 --> 45:02.161
Make it quick.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.882
<i>♪ I bounce my baby on my knee ♪</i>

45:41.040 --> 45:43.691
<i>♪ And see her laughing
back at me ♪</i>

45:43.880 --> 45:46.451
<i>♪ Makes living sweet
as it can be ♪</i>

45:46.600 --> 45:48.523
<i>♪ My little Maggie ♪</i>

45:48.720 --> 45:51.007
<i>♪ To see her try
to dance and sing ♪</i>

45:51.160 --> 45:53.561
<i>♪ Oh, man,
she's into everything ♪</i>

45:53.720 --> 45:58.681
<i>♪ Must find a rocking horse
to bring my little Maggie be ♪</i>

45:58.840 --> 46:00.046
<i>♪ Now do you ever ♪</i>

46:15.480 --> 46:17.448
Caroline, the food is delicious.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.241
Oh...
Ah, the stove is shot. I...

46:21.400 --> 46:23.801
Some of it's really...

46:27.920 --> 46:31.447
You think this is funny? Hm?

46:31.640 --> 46:36.282
Well, no dessert for either of you.

46:36.480 --> 46:39.211
Is that a threat
or a stay of execution?

47:03.320 --> 47:06.688
Why do you even still
have this piece of crap?

47:06.880 --> 47:08.882
Well, because I trust
this piece of crap.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.128
You know,
Caroline had four cars now,

47:13.280 --> 47:16.090
- and they all broke down.
- Yeah, I know.

47:16.240 --> 47:18.686
I had to pick her up the last time.

47:18.840 --> 47:21.571
What did you pick her up in?

47:21.720 --> 47:23.165
You see?

47:28.920 --> 47:30.331
What are you reading there?

47:30.480 --> 47:33.484
Uh, it's called
"Morning Light of the Past."

47:33.640 --> 47:36.120
It was in one of Mom's boxes.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.329
It's like really, really weird.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.524
Your mother was a bookworm.

47:47.160 --> 47:49.970
Until today, I still don't
know what she saw in me...

47:52.240 --> 47:54.163
because she had everything.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.721
She was smart, beautiful,

47:56.880 --> 47:59.645
- and she had those long legs.
- Okay. Okay, Dad. Thank you.

47:59.800 --> 48:03.441
- That's enough.
- What? I mean, I'm just saying.

48:03.600 --> 48:07.366
I mean, the whole time we dated,
she always pushed books on me.

48:07.520 --> 48:09.727
She always
wanted me to read more.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.922
And I just didn't have
the time with the farm and all.

48:16.120 --> 48:19.647
- You read to me all the time.
- Only because she made me.

48:19.800 --> 48:24.442
I remember just
before you were born...

48:26.000 --> 48:28.446
and I bought a whole bunch of books.

48:28.600 --> 48:31.285
And your mother had
a hell of a green thumb.

48:31.440 --> 48:33.681
And there was this one book

48:33.840 --> 48:36.525
that I read to you
over and over.

48:36.720 --> 48:40.327
It was called "A Daisy's Journey."

48:40.520 --> 48:43.444
That's actually how you got your name.

48:43.600 --> 48:48.481
- There's a Marguerite in it?
- And your mother loved those flowers.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.768
She just loved them.

48:53.320 --> 48:56.324
And she was so strong.

48:56.480 --> 48:59.131
I mean, every time
she needed to fight back,

48:59.280 --> 49:01.567
she did.

49:01.720 --> 49:05.441
You have a lot of your mother in you.
You know that?

49:14.400 --> 49:18.962
You know, maybe
it was the, um, truck.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.527
What?

49:23.760 --> 49:26.240
Why Mom loved you.

49:28.840 --> 49:33.050
Well, that's for sure.

49:33.240 --> 49:35.083
My truck.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.851
<i>No!</i>

49:44.000 --> 49:46.162
<i>No!</i>

49:48.760 --> 49:52.048
No! No!

51:10.080 --> 51:13.448
Maggie? Allie's here.

51:18.040 --> 51:21.726
Hey. Oh my God.
There she is!

51:21.880 --> 51:24.326
Shut up.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.720
- Oh...
- Hi!

51:25.880 --> 51:27.723
Where have you been?

51:27.880 --> 51:30.850
Oh. Well, I haven't
been feeling too well.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:32.920 --> 51:35.127
Well, how are you feeling right now?

51:35.320 --> 51:38.051
- Uh, right now?
- Yeah.

51:38.240 --> 51:40.527
Um... why?

51:40.680 --> 51:43.968
Okay. All right. Trent and Candace
and a few other people

51:44.160 --> 51:46.288
are going out to the reservoir tonight.

51:46.440 --> 51:51.287
I know it's not like
a super fun trip to KC or whatever,

51:51.440 --> 51:54.330
but school starts soon
and I doubt our parents

51:54.480 --> 51:57.165
are gonna let us out
much further than that.

51:57.320 --> 52:01.245
- Trent's going?
- Yeah. Did you hear?

52:01.400 --> 52:05.086
Yeah. How's he doing?

52:05.240 --> 52:08.369
I don't know. I mean,
he seems all right,

52:08.560 --> 52:10.767
but don't take my word for it.

52:10.920 --> 52:13.161
You should come see for yourself.

52:13.320 --> 52:15.766
Right.

52:15.920 --> 52:20.130
Come on. Everybody misses you.
They wanna see you.

52:20.320 --> 52:21.890
I miss you,

52:22.040 --> 52:24.407
and I'm not going without you. Okay?

52:24.560 --> 52:28.770
Hey, uh, hold on real quick.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.605
- What?
- Here.

52:31.760 --> 52:36.482
I found it on the couch the other day
and threw it on this old thing.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.371
I figured you might wanna wear it.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.927
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.

52:47.080 --> 52:50.926
Go, get out of here
before Allie explodes.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.411
Yeah, I know, right?
We are late.

52:52.600 --> 52:56.969
And you have a nice
young man waiting for you.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.770
Is it gonna be like
this all night?

52:58.920 --> 53:00.729
- Um, yes.
- Oh God!

53:00.880 --> 53:03.247
- Yes, it actually is.
- Take me now.

53:45.960 --> 53:47.724
Oh, here we go!

53:47.880 --> 53:49.245
- Hey! How are you?
- Hey.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.801
- Hey!
- Hi. Long time no see!

54:05.160 --> 54:07.128
<i>I don't get why they're
opening up the school so soon.</i>

54:07.280 --> 54:10.762
- Gotta get back to normal.
- Normal?

54:10.920 --> 54:13.082
What's normal about all of this?

54:13.240 --> 54:15.208
Now, we have teachers missing.

54:15.360 --> 54:17.124
Still have a bunch of infected people.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.281
No offense. Not you guys.

54:20.480 --> 54:23.370
But like the Andersons. You know?

54:23.520 --> 54:26.763
- How many more are like that?
- What happened?

54:26.920 --> 54:28.922
She had them locked up in a room.

54:29.080 --> 54:32.971
Didn't tell anybody.

54:33.160 --> 54:36.323
And they got out,
and Mag's dad found her.

54:36.480 --> 54:39.245
Holy shit, Mag.
What'd your dad do?

54:39.400 --> 54:41.926
Look, does it matter?
They're dead.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.969
Point is, she screwed up.

54:44.120 --> 54:48.523
I mean, how many other people
have people locked away? You know?

54:48.720 --> 54:50.722
What should Bonnie have done?

54:50.880 --> 54:53.121
What would you do?

54:53.280 --> 54:56.887
What should my dad
do to me? Quarantine?

54:57.040 --> 54:59.805
Do you know
what it's like there?

55:02.040 --> 55:04.850
My uncle works
at the hospital in KC.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.924
He said that they tell
people everything's nice.

55:08.080 --> 55:11.926
That they'll...
They'll hold your hand until the end,

55:12.120 --> 55:14.885
but they don't.

55:15.080 --> 55:18.084
They throw you in a big room
with everyone else.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.720
They don't separate the phases.

55:20.920 --> 55:23.491
Everyone's all bunched up together,

55:23.640 --> 55:27.804
people eating people,

55:27.960 --> 55:31.089
and they don't care.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.480
So what would you do?

55:35.360 --> 55:37.727
You know what I would do to me?

55:40.480 --> 55:42.164
I'd put a gun right here.

55:44.480 --> 55:45.606
Bang.

56:00.160 --> 56:02.447
Mason's a dick.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.680
He's just afraid.

56:06.880 --> 56:09.531
Yeah, but he's still a dick.

56:16.880 --> 56:19.850
You know he stayed over
the night before I got bit?

56:22.640 --> 56:27.202
Played video games
and got into all of Dad's beer.

56:27.400 --> 56:31.200
And when he found out, he put me
to work in the field the next morning.

56:33.480 --> 56:36.723
She looked really bad, Mag.

56:38.400 --> 56:42.200
I don't know why I went
over to her, but I did.

56:42.360 --> 56:45.091
Felt bad, I guess.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.602
I told her to stay there,

56:50.800 --> 56:54.486
but when I turned around
to call for Dad...

56:57.200 --> 56:59.123
she bit me.

57:01.280 --> 57:04.284
I could see it in her eyes.

57:04.480 --> 57:07.006
She regretted it.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.640
Probably didn't even know she did it.

57:12.040 --> 57:13.849
Then Dad showed up.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.322
He shot her in the chest
and in the head.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.969
I'm sorry.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.122
It's not your fault.

57:29.280 --> 57:33.842
No. No. I mean...

57:34.000 --> 57:35.889
about us.

57:37.240 --> 57:40.084
I figured I'd done something wrong.

57:40.240 --> 57:44.564
No. I was just...

57:44.720 --> 57:46.802
scared, I guess.

57:46.960 --> 57:49.884
Yeah. Me, too.

57:53.240 --> 57:56.289
I missed you.

57:56.440 --> 57:58.283
I missed you, too.

58:11.160 --> 58:13.766
I missed that.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.729
So did I.

58:41.960 --> 58:44.850
Well...

58:45.040 --> 58:47.611
Thanks.

58:47.760 --> 58:51.082
Yeah. I'm gonna see you
again this weekend, right?

58:51.240 --> 58:54.289
Yeah. I promise.

58:56.600 --> 58:59.206
Okay. Well, I'm going to hold you to it.

58:59.360 --> 59:01.408
Yeah, when don't you?

59:10.840 --> 59:13.730
Hey, wait. Wait.

59:15.880 --> 59:18.087
I love you, okay?

59:20.360 --> 59:22.522
I love you, too.

59:29.680 --> 59:32.081
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Okay.

59:56.520 --> 59:58.409
Dad?

59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.370
Hey.
There's no need to shout.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.409
He's downstairs.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:08.441
- Here. Let me see.
- Not too close.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.364
I'll be fine.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.807
Do you smell that?

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.806
No.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.363
Are you sure?
It smells like food.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:33.248
It's probably your father
cooking up something you shouldn't have.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.807
I'll get the drops.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.441
Wade?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.926
Caroline?
You find the drops?

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.084
No! No. Hold on a sec.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.162
Oh, hey, did you find them?

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.241
Thanks.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.847
So, what was Dad cooking?

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.088
- Caroline?
- Oh, uh...

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.006
Nothing. Hm... Nothing.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.567
Maggie? Phone!

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.370
Hello?

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.602
Trent?

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.085
What?

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.408
Trent.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.801
Please.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.207
Just open the door.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.049
Please.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.491
What are you doing in here?

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.047
Just let me talk to him.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.246
Trent?

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.609
Maggie.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.284
I can't open the door.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.569
I smelled him, Mag.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.841
I can't go to quarantine.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.761
<i>We're ready for
the extraction and will confirm with you</i>

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.446
<i>- that we are en route.</i>
- Easy, gentlemen. Easy.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.400
<i>Go ahead with the extraction.</i>

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.927
Your uncle said
he would take care of you!

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.890
- He said it wouldn't be like the others.
- I won't go!

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.286
Look, I know
that you're scared.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.370
I am, too.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.601
But you are so strong.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.404
I've always seen that in you.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.889
Just... just let me in!

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.963
This is the police.
We are entering the home!

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.681
Let's go.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.848
Get away from the door,
Maggie.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.044
Maggie? Please?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.125
You need to open the door!

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.566
Come on, son.
It's time.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.202
Trent?
Just open the door.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.890
Step back, son.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:00.962
Dad? Please? Dad, please!

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.690
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Listen.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.002
- It's gonna be okay! Trent!
- Maggie!

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.607
It's gonna be okay!

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.281
Go home, Maggie.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.851
Just go home.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.841
Dais? Maggie!

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.568
Wade? Oh!

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.122
Maggie!

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.362
Wade!

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.042
Wade!
We have to take her in!

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.202
- No! No! No!
- We have to take her in now!

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:43.850
No!

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.281
Look at me. Look at me.

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:59.609
Good, Daisy baby.
That's good.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.764
Now tell me.
What happened?

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.763
- Hey, come on.
- Don't!

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.845
I'm not moving!
I'm not moving.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.849
He was afraid of me.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.281
I didn't know it.
I didn't know it.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:16.011
I swear, I didn't know it.
I didn't know it.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.970
What was?
What was afraid of you?

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.125
The fox. The fox.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.401
I heard...
I heard it and then I...

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.366
And then I caught it in the trap,
and it smelled...

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.326
I couldn't stop.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.841
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.571
Daddy, I just wanted to help it!

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.645
Daddy, I just wanted to help it!
I'm sorry!

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.849
Don't.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.690
I'm sorry.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.250
It's okay.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.570
It's okay.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.568
Wade, please,

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.610
just call them.
It's time now.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.205
She has to go in.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.808
What if it was Molly?

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.885
Or Bobby?

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.085
After everything
that we've been through,

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.322
you still think it's about that?

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.165
I've loved her like she was my own,

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.368
but she's not her anymore.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.323
- Wade, please.
- Don't.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.246
I'm chewing so loud.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.841
She was afraid of me,
wasn't she?

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.329
When did she leave?

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.409
Yesterday.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.325
I don't feel well.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.084
You got enough firewood there?

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.766
Well, if you'd get
the power turned back on again,

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.127
I wouldn't have
to do this everyday.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.601
Well, you know
that's not my department.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.285
So, why are you here?

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.530
Need to talk to you about Mag.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.444
The time's come, Wade.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.123
Can we see her?

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.569
- This is bullshit.
- Holt.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.371
No. She's well beyond the time.
She needs to be in quarantine.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.285
We've got an entire town to protect!

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.930
I'm going to the house, Wade.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:37.244
You know she needs
to be in quarantine.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.606
Wade...

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.650
Get out of my way.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.690
Now, come on, boys.
We don't need this.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.401
Wade, just...

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.961
let us take a look at her.
All right?

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.566
You're not gonna take her in.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.481
Wade!

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.322
Wade!

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480
Stop!

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.410
Stop it!

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.251
Leave us alone.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.885
Maggie?

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.328
Maggie, you tell me you're doing okay,
and we'll leave. All right?

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.530
Ray,
