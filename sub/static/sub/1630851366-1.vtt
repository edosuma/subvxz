WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:04.437
It's been a while.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.072
I've missed you.

00:06.139 --> 00:08.108
Well, I've missed the jungle,
and I've missed the ocean,

00:08.174 --> 00:10.877
but mostly, I've missed
our time together.

00:10.944 --> 00:14.347
<i>Survivor</i> started out as this
tiny little social experiment,

00:14.414 --> 00:17.751
and it has evolved into one
of the most mentally draining,

00:17.817 --> 00:20.787
physically challenging
and socially complicated games

00:20.854 --> 00:22.522
ever seen on television.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.158
And you've been there
every step of the way,

00:25.225 --> 00:27.260
which is why we thought
it would be fun this season

00:27.327 --> 00:29.396
to invite you inside the game
a little more,

00:29.462 --> 00:31.164
make you coconspirators.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.532
So, at times, you'll know

00:32.599 --> 00:34.634
what's happening
before the players know.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.737
You can play along,
second-guess, like this.

00:37.804 --> 00:40.440
It's a new advantage,
the Beware Advantage.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.842
This advantage comes with risk.

00:42.909 --> 00:45.578
So, if you want this,
you better be sure.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.614
What would you do
if you found it?

00:47.680 --> 00:49.916
I'm gonna hide this
at the Yase tribe camp.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.185
The other two tribes
will have one as well.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.920
We just want
to have fun this season,

00:53.987 --> 00:57.157
so we're gonna lean into
the best kind of<i> Survivor</i> fun,

00:57.223 --> 00:58.925
the dangerous Kind.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.527
Plus, we're gonna
increase the pace.

01:00.593 --> 01:02.228
These players will go 26 days,

01:02.295 --> 01:04.164
which means they have to hit
the ground running

01:04.230 --> 01:07.734
because there will be nowhere
to hide and no time to hide.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.703
Plus, small tribes, no rice,

01:10.770 --> 01:12.439
penalties for losing,

01:12.505 --> 01:14.441
and you've got to earn
everything.

01:14.507 --> 01:18.711
And even then,
the unexpected dangerous twist

01:18.778 --> 01:20.547
can take it all away.

01:20.613 --> 01:21.981
What do you want from me?

01:22.048 --> 01:25.151
We're just trying to evolve
the experiment a little more

01:25.218 --> 01:27.887
and see how it goes,
and we'll do it together.

01:27.954 --> 01:31.524

what that number feels like.

Oh, my gosh,

06:18.111 --> 06:19.679

06:19.746 --> 06:21.447
and it got taken away

06:21.514 --> 06:23.149

06:25.718 --> 06:27.153
that they're never

with my boyfriend,

07:31.284 --> 07:33.119

07:33.186 --> 07:35.354

or creating a family with you.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.497
Well, thank you
for the family experience,

07:49.402 --> 07:50.670
-makes this show...

...is for families like yours.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.506

07:53.573 --> 07:55.174
-Yeah.
-PROBST: All right.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.643
Now, as we all know,
we are in the midst

07:57.710 --> 08:01.080
of one of the most powerful,
still evolving periods of time

08:01.147 --> 08:03.883

go through in our lives.

or may not really have,

that you want to talk about it,

08:13.759 --> 08:14.760
talk about it.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.828
Who knows?
We might learn something.

08:15.895 --> 08:16.996
In fact, I'll start because

08:17.063 --> 08:18.965
I need your guidance
on something.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.667
For 20 years,
I have used one phrase

08:21.734 --> 08:23.636
to call people in
for challenges.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.339
ALL:
Come on in, guys.

08:26.405 --> 08:27.406
-(laughter)
-PROBST: "Come on in, guys."

08:27.473 --> 08:28.507
Yeah.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.109
Love saying it--
it's part of the show--

08:30.176 --> 08:32.044
but I, too, want
to be of the moment.

08:32.111 --> 08:35.214
So my question to you
to decide for us,

08:35.281 --> 08:37.183
in the context of<i> Survivor,</i>

08:37.250 --> 08:39.185
is a word like "guys" okay,

08:39.252 --> 08:41.187
or is it time
to retire that word?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.356
What do you think?

08:43.422 --> 08:45.258
I personally think
"guys" is okay.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.560
It's part of, you know--
"Come in, guys"

08:47.627 --> 08:49.695
is, like, such a signature
expression, and, you know,

08:49.762 --> 08:52.398
I as a woman, as a queer woman,
do not feel excluded by "guys."

08:52.465 --> 08:54.734
Hmm. Yeah.
Does anybody disagree?

08:56.068 --> 08:58.738
-No.
-We feel okay keeping "guys"?

08:58.804 --> 09:00.172
"Guys" is good.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.842
Okay, mark it down--
discussed and decided.

09:02.909 --> 09:05.778
-(laughter)
-All right, tribe names.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.680

09:13.519 --> 09:15.955
-Yase!
-(whooping)

09:16.022 --> 09:17.723
-And Ua, wearing green.
-Ua! Yeah!

09:17.790 --> 09:18.925
-Ua!
-Yeah.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.493
PROBST:
I'm gonna tell you up front,

09:20.559 --> 09:22.895
this season is going to be
more difficult than ever to win,

09:22.962 --> 09:24.830
and here are
a few of the reasons.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.066
It's going to be
a shorter season,

09:27.133 --> 09:32.071
which means an already fast pace
will be relentless.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.840
There will be no time to breathe
and nowhere to hide.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.444
You are also starting
with very meager supplies.

09:38.511 --> 09:42.181
One pot, one machete, one flint.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.582
That's it.

09:43.649 --> 09:47.253
No rice, no food source, and...

09:47.320 --> 09:52.358
gameplay that I promise you
has never been so dangerous.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.926
-Ooh!
-(whooping)

09:53.993 --> 09:56.562
PROBST:
When you look at your box,
you see a four and a one,

09:56.629 --> 09:59.265
my suggestion is
drop the four, keep the one.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.500
This is a new era of<i> Survivor.</i>

10:01.567 --> 10:05.905
Let's get to your first test
as brand-new tribes.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.641
On this boat, scattered,

10:08.708 --> 10:12.778
<i>18 color-coded paddles,</i>
<i>six for each tribe.</i>

10:12.845 --> 10:14.246
<i>On my go, you got to get</i>

10:14.313 --> 10:16.716
<i>your six paddles</i>
<i>and your six tribe members</i>

10:16.782 --> 10:19.185
<i>off this barge</i>
<i>and onto your raft.</i>

10:19.251 --> 10:21.988
<i>Then you're gonna paddle out</i>
<i>and around a buoy</i>

10:22.054 --> 10:24.357
<i>and race back to where</i>

10:24.423 --> 10:26.325
<i>you'll see a flint</i>
<i>dangling from a pole.</i>

10:26.392 --> 10:28.728
<i>The first tribe to get the flint</i>

10:28.794 --> 10:31.130
earns those meager supplies--
pot, machete, flint.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.733
The other two tribes
will leave here with nothing.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.503
You'll have to go back to camp
and try to earn them again,

10:37.570 --> 10:39.905
wasting valuable
shelter-building time.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.541
I wish you all good luck.
And go!

10:43.809 --> 10:46.245
<i>Survivor</i> 41 is on!

10:47.747 --> 10:50.016
Opening moments.
You don't know each other,

10:50.082 --> 10:51.417
you've not said a word,

10:51.484 --> 10:52.952
but you've got to quickly
figure out

10:53.019 --> 10:55.187
how to work together.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.157
You are looking for six
of your tribe-colored paddles.

10:58.224 --> 10:59.792
They're not gonna be easy
to get to.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.228
If there are knots,
you got to untie them.

11:02.294 --> 11:04.630
If there's something on top
of it, you got to get it off.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.032
ABRAHAM:
I got two.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.934
PROBST:
All you need is six
of your paddles

11:09.001 --> 11:12.671
and your six tribe members
off the barge and on your raft.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.407
Somebody get in the water
for blue!

11:17.176 --> 11:18.277
Here's another blue!

11:21.814 --> 11:24.383
PROBST:
Doing a nice job there
gathering all their paddles,

11:24.450 --> 11:26.819
and now they're
tossing them over.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.521
Great strategy.

11:29.688 --> 11:32.258
"Do they have all six?"
is the question.

11:32.324 --> 11:35.728
VOCE: No, no, no, no!
One, two, three, four, five.

11:35.795 --> 11:36.996
-There's one more yellow.
-One more.

11:37.063 --> 11:38.164
One more yellow.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.668
Ua has their sixth.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.003
Blue, we got six.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.271
Blue, we got six. Come on.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.506
PROBST:
Who's gonna get all six paddles

11:47.573 --> 11:49.208
and get to their boat first?

11:50.943 --> 11:53.846
Danny's in the water.
Genie's in the water.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.618
Brad getting ready to leap.

12:04.423 --> 12:05.991
Nice entry.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.995
All the paddles
were in the same spot,

12:10.062 --> 12:12.264
so it's interesting
that one tribe is struggling.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.166
-Nothing up here. I promise.
-VOCE: Okay.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.069
-TIFFANY: We have 'em?
-ABRAHAM: No, we're missing one.

12:18.437 --> 12:20.806
PROBST:
They were all in six groups.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.241
What happened?

12:22.308 --> 12:23.709
Hold it. Hold it.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.044
Ready. Go, go!

12:25.111 --> 12:28.948
Luvu has all six paddles
and all six players,

12:29.014 --> 12:30.950
and they are heading out.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.218

in the front and the back.

for Yase.

12:57.743 --> 13:00.045
-Go, go!

to be... not moving.

out to that buoy.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.358
One, two, three.

13:12.424 --> 13:13.792
PROBST:
Ua now in the water.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.362
They have got a very good pace
out of the gate.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.797
-Press it hard! Press it hard!
-(grunting)

13:18.864 --> 13:22.501

Ua now with a really nice
group effort.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.904
Ua now starting
to pull in the lead.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.439
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Luvu is
going backwards.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.842
Luvu got out to a fast start,
and literally,

13:29.909 --> 13:31.877
it is if they are anchored
in the water.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.412
One, two, three. Row.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.880
We're not moving, guys.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.617

It's now Ua pulling away.

13:39.618 --> 13:41.820

of paddling together

of the biggest embarrassments

for Yase right now.

to green and blue.

waiting for you back at camp.

earn them another way.

those words to me,

46:16.840 --> 46:19.443
<i>I didn't have to keep up</i>
<i>with my lie</i>

46:19.510 --> 46:21.245
<i>and, you know, remember</i>
<i>the little things</i>

46:21.311 --> 46:23.313
<i>I changed and tweaked.</i>

46:23.380 --> 46:25.516
So, I always find it
interesting that people love

46:25.582 --> 46:29.086
to lie about these, you know,
risk/reward scenarios.

46:30.087 --> 46:32.456
<i>BRAD: You got a big bag</i>
<i>of rice in the bag?</i>

46:32.523 --> 46:33.991
-JD: No, I wish.
-(laughs)

46:34.057 --> 46:35.759
But, like, if y'all really want
to check, like, here's my bag.

46:35.826 --> 46:37.427
-Go through the bag.
-BRAD: Oh, no, no, no, no.

46:37.494 --> 46:39.163
RICARD:
Oh, honey, I'm going through it.

46:39.229 --> 46:40.831
I will...
I will literally, like,

46:40.898 --> 46:43.233
nothing in here,
and I will take my pants off.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.903
<i>I sit everybody down,</i>
<i>and I'm like,</i>

46:45.969 --> 46:47.905
"I have a story to tell."

46:47.971 --> 46:49.673
From the beginning,
get on the boat.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.642
You know, we're cruising,
and I'm like, mmm,

46:51.708 --> 46:53.477
and my hair's, like,
flowing through the wind

46:53.544 --> 46:54.978
and I think I look amazing.

46:55.045 --> 46:57.848
I look over, and then there's
two people in different boats

46:57.915 --> 47:00.050
whose hair looks
even more amazing.

47:00.117 --> 47:02.085
And we jump out the boat,
and we're like, "Oh, what's up?"

47:02.152 --> 47:04.288
And, like, we're all stoked
to meet each other.

47:05.355 --> 47:08.225
So, we have to do this trek,

47:08.292 --> 47:11.962
probably a little over an hour,
and I-I led the way.

47:12.029 --> 47:16.767
And so, yeah, but that's not
the end of it. Um...

47:17.768 --> 47:20.070
There is this ship's wheel,
right?

47:20.137 --> 47:23.774
Xander and Danny both had
the same thing,

47:23.840 --> 47:27.844
and if one of us hits...
if one of us turns it

47:27.911 --> 47:30.047
and it says "risk your vote"

47:30.113 --> 47:33.650
and two people turn it
and say "protect your vote,"

47:33.717 --> 47:35.285
someone gets an extra vote.

47:35.352 --> 47:38.989
But if two people
risk their vote,

47:39.056 --> 47:41.758
then they lose their vote
at the next Tribal Council.

47:41.825 --> 47:43.760
If you lose a vote,
like, you're screwed.

47:43.827 --> 47:46.330
-SHAN: So, what did you do?
-I protected my vote.

47:46.396 --> 47:48.298
I didn't want to be the person

47:48.365 --> 47:51.001
to just screw everything up,
you know, for myself.

47:51.068 --> 47:52.869
I told them that
I protected my vote,

47:52.936 --> 47:55.572
<i>and I gave them so much</i>
<i>information that I don't think</i>

47:55.639 --> 47:59.543
I left room for them to believe
I was leaving anything out.

47:59.610 --> 48:02.779
And I feel like everybody's
still getting to know each other

48:02.846 --> 48:05.449

48:05.515 --> 48:07.985
it's-it's in that blurry
gray area so far.

-RICARD: And the reality is

49:24.194 --> 49:25.562
there was so much going on--

49:25.629 --> 49:27.698
there's so much commotion,
cameras, my hair is messed up,

49:27.764 --> 49:29.266
I'm half crying--

49:29.333 --> 49:32.102
I don't have the capacity to do

changing it to something else.

49:42.212 --> 49:44.214
I just don't really
agree with it.

49:44.281 --> 49:48.852
Reality is<i> Survivor</i> has changed
over the last 21 years,

49:48.919 --> 49:50.787
and those changes
have allowed all of us,

49:50.854 --> 49:53.390

Black people, Asian people,

49:53.457 --> 49:55.692

49:55.759 --> 49:58.295
PROBST:
Yeah. It's a great point,
and I got to say,

49:58.362 --> 49:59.930
I love that you thought
about it more.

49:59.996 --> 50:02.499
I love that you had the courage
inside a million-dollar game

50:02.566 --> 50:05.702
in which standing up anytime
is risky

50:05.769 --> 50:08.338
to bring it up again,
because I'm with you.

50:08.405 --> 50:09.906
I want to change it.

50:09.973 --> 50:12.509
I'm glad that was the last time
I will ever say it.

50:12.576 --> 50:15.011
And realizing in this moment

50:15.078 --> 50:17.714
somebody right now
is on social media saying,

50:17.781 --> 50:19.116
"Oh, he caved,"

50:19.182 --> 50:21.118

50:29.092 --> 50:30.660
Okay.

50:30.727 --> 50:33.263
I want to tell you about
a new twist at Tribal Council.

50:33.330 --> 50:35.832
Gonna complicate the game
a little more.

50:35.899 --> 50:36.933
(sighing)

50:37.000 --> 50:38.869
If you go to Tribal Council

50:38.935 --> 50:40.804
and you fear you are in danger

50:40.871 --> 50:43.940
but you don't have an advantage,
you don't have an idol,

50:44.007 --> 50:46.410
this is
the Shot in the Dark die.

50:46.476 --> 50:48.145
Here's how
the Shot in the Dark works.

50:48.211 --> 50:52.416
<i>This die gives you the power</i>
<i>to decide not to vote</i>

50:52.482 --> 50:54.684
<i>but instead reach into a bag</i>

50:54.751 --> 50:57.521
<i>and draw for</i>
<i>a one-in-six shot at safety</i>

50:57.587 --> 50:59.689
<i>that night at Tribal Council.</i>

51:00.690 --> 51:03.126
Low odds. It's like 17%.

51:03.193 --> 51:05.896
But if you need a Hail Mary,
this will give it to you.

51:05.962 --> 51:07.764
Comes with a big invoice--
you can't vote--

51:07.831 --> 51:09.366
but if you think
you're in trouble,

51:09.433 --> 51:10.734
what does your vote matter
anyway?

51:10.801 --> 51:14.104
And this decision
will happen in private,

51:14.171 --> 51:15.705
in the voting booth,

51:15.772 --> 51:18.642
so nobody will know
what you've done

51:18.708 --> 51:22.345
until just before
I read the votes.

51:22.412 --> 51:25.215
Very new complication
to the strategy.

51:25.282 --> 51:26.850
There's one in here
for each of you.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.885
You can take these back
to your camp.

51:28.952 --> 51:30.520

In the tribe stage of the game,

51:45.168 --> 51:47.704
this is what you want,
because if this is at your camp,

51:47.771 --> 51:49.239

55:38.301 --> 55:40.770
PROBST:
Luvu once again not sure
what they're doing.

55:40.837 --> 55:42.338
One, two, three!

55:42.405 --> 55:43.940
PROBST:
Ua finishes the first level.

55:44.007 --> 55:46.910
-(grunting)
-Everybody working hard.

55:46.976 --> 55:49.145
Yase finishes the first level.

55:50.146 --> 55:52.082
Luvu trying to get back
into this now.

55:52.148 --> 55:53.183
(grunting)

55:53.249 --> 55:54.784
One, two, three!

55:54.851 --> 55:57.587
PROBST:
Ua in the lead, now starting
on that second level.

55:57.654 --> 55:59.856
Luvu still all the way back
at the first.

55:59.923 --> 56:02.258
One, two, three. (grunts)

56:02.325 --> 56:06.196
That sled is very heavy,
but you can do it.

56:06.262 --> 56:08.598
-Come on, let's go, Genie.
-(grunting)

56:08.665 --> 56:11.201
PROBST:
Ua's almost at the top.

56:12.168 --> 56:14.571
LUVU TRIBE:
One, two, three!

56:17.173 --> 56:18.808
PROBST:
Ua's first up.

56:18.875 --> 56:21.244
Now two people doing the puzzle.

56:21.311 --> 56:22.645
(grunting, shouting)

56:22.712 --> 56:25.482
Yase, Luvu still working
to get to the top.

56:25.548 --> 56:26.716
EVVIE:
This is it, Abraham.

56:26.783 --> 56:29.719
Pulling for Yase,

56:29.786 --> 56:31.755
and Luvu is fighting
to stay in this.

56:31.821 --> 56:33.757
-One, two, three!
-(grunting)

56:33.823 --> 56:35.458
PROBST:
And now Luvu's starting
to close the gap.

56:35.525 --> 56:38.128
We got a big advantage.
Come on, let's go.

56:38.194 --> 56:40.263
(indistinct shouting)

56:40.330 --> 56:43.266
-One, two, three.
-PROBST: These are very heavy,

56:43.333 --> 56:46.703
especially after two and a half
very taxing days.

56:46.770 --> 56:48.905
-Two, three!
-PROBST: To pull
a lot of weight.

56:48.972 --> 56:51.107
Yase very close. One big tug.

56:51.174 --> 56:52.842
-LIANA: Yase, together.
-EVVIE: One...

56:52.909 --> 56:54.377
YASE TRIBE:
One, two, three!

56:54.444 --> 56:55.578
-(grunting)
-Go!

56:55.645 --> 56:57.480
One, two, three!

56:57.547 --> 56:58.615
(grunting)

56:58.681 --> 57:00.216
Yase, you've done it!

57:00.283 --> 57:02.652
-Get it all the way in!
-Come on, come on. Keep going!

57:02.719 --> 57:05.255
PROBST:
Here comes Luvu.
You're back in it!

57:05.321 --> 57:07.924
That's how to dig,
Luvu, right there.

57:07.991 --> 57:10.560
You are back right in this.
Two people on the puzzle.

57:10.627 --> 57:14.764
-Good job, good job.
-PROBST: Exhausted bodies
everywhere.

57:14.831 --> 57:17.000
This is<i> Survivor</i> 41.

57:17.066 --> 57:18.434
Just breathe.

57:18.501 --> 57:21.337
You are birthing a new era
of this game right now.

57:21.404 --> 57:23.339
-You guys got it.
-You got this, guys.
We are so in it.

57:23.406 --> 57:25.875
-RICARD: We're still in this.
-Just look. It's okay.

57:25.942 --> 57:28.044
We have time. You got this.

57:28.111 --> 57:29.913
They're double-sided.
They're double-sided.

57:29.979 --> 57:33.016
-Don't worry.
-Good. There you go.
There you go. Let's go!

57:33.082 --> 57:34.884
Yeah, Shan!

57:34.951 --> 57:37.253
PROBST: Shan and Sara getting
a lot of early momentum.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.522
Yeah, baby! Whoo!

57:39.589 --> 57:41.224
-Yes!
-PROBST: Right now it is Ua,

57:41.291 --> 57:45.461
and then Yase and Luvu
fighting for second.

57:45.528 --> 57:49.899
Unfortunately, today, second is
no different from third.

57:49.966 --> 57:51.434
You're both last.

57:51.501 --> 57:52.735
JD:
Yeah, get it in there!

57:52.802 --> 57:53.970
There you go!

57:54.037 --> 57:57.106
Wow, Ua continues to rip
through this puzzle.

57:57.173 --> 57:58.441
You got it, you got it!

57:58.508 --> 57:59.843
Luvu was in trouble early,

57:59.909 --> 58:02.812
and they're trying
to get back in it now.

58:02.879 --> 58:04.781
Erika trying to fit that piece,
and it's done!

58:04.848 --> 58:06.649
It's now Yase in last place.

58:06.716 --> 58:08.251
Turn that around flat.

58:08.318 --> 58:09.252
PROBST:
Again.

58:09.319 --> 58:10.353
-Yes!
-Nice.

58:10.420 --> 58:12.655
Another piece by Deshawn.

58:12.722 --> 58:15.725
Luvu is in this now.
We got a challenge.

58:15.792 --> 58:17.360
Another piece for Ua.

58:17.427 --> 58:19.262
They're trying
to hold on to that lead,

58:19.329 --> 58:21.731
-but Luvu is right
on their tail.
-NASEER: Yes, yes! Here we go!

58:21.798 --> 58:23.700
-On-on the long part.
-HEATHER: Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

58:23.766 --> 58:26.436
PROBST:
Yase has made
very little progress.

58:26.502 --> 58:28.171
We're missing a piece.

58:28.238 --> 58:29.639
Keep working till you find that.

58:29.706 --> 58:31.074
You can do it. Yeah.

58:31.140 --> 58:32.375
It is now Luvu in the lead.

58:32.442 --> 58:33.810
-Yes!
-Yes!

58:33.877 --> 58:37.614
Luvu had to go all the way back
because of an error,

58:37.680 --> 58:40.383
and Luvu is now in first place.

58:40.450 --> 58:42.118
SARA:
Where's the...

58:42.185 --> 58:44.754
-BRAD: That's not it.
-GENIE: You got this.
You got this.

58:44.821 --> 58:46.589
PROBST:
What a comeback this would be.

58:46.656 --> 58:47.690
(whooping)

58:49.859 --> 58:52.629
PROBST:
And Ua just discovers

58:52.695 --> 58:55.098
they had not emptied
all of their pieces.

58:55.164 --> 58:56.966
They were still in the bag.

58:57.033 --> 58:58.868
An impossible way
to solve a puzzle.

58:58.935 --> 59:00.003
HEATHER:
Yes, yes, yes!

59:00.069 --> 59:01.137
PROBST:
Wow.

59:01.204 --> 59:03.072
That's that adrenaline
causing panic,

59:03.139 --> 59:04.774
causing a mistake,

59:04.841 --> 59:07.677
which leads to a visit
to Tribal Council

59:07.744 --> 59:10.313
as Luvu is closer and closer.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.782
Ua, now that they have
all their pieces,

59:12.849 --> 59:15.618
they're actually starting
to get back into this.

59:15.685 --> 59:17.253
It makes you wonder
what would've happened

59:17.320 --> 59:19.289
if they had 'em all
from the beginning.

59:19.355 --> 59:21.491
Deshawn with
the next to last piece.

59:21.557 --> 59:23.593
Erika for the win.

59:23.660 --> 59:25.495
(cheering, exclaiming)

59:25.561 --> 59:27.263
-And they've got it!
-(cheering)

59:27.330 --> 59:31.534
Luvu wins first immunity
challenge of<i> Survivor</i> 41...

59:31.601 --> 59:33.036
(excited chatter)

59:33.102 --> 59:36.205
...sending Ua and Yase
to Tribal Council.

59:36.272 --> 59:38.775
(excited chatter,
cheering continue)

59:40.076 --> 59:42.946
(cheering)

59:48.818 --> 59:50.620
Luvu.

59:50.687 --> 59:52.388
Congratulations.

59:52.455 --> 59:55.792
Tribe immunity is yours.

59:55.858 --> 59:57.994
All six of you are safe.

59:58.061 --> 59:59.362
Nobody going home.

59:59.429 --> 1:00:00.730
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

1:00:00.797 --> 1:00:02.265
Enjoy the night off.

1:00:02.332 --> 1:00:03.399
-Congratulations.
-(whooping)

1:00:03.466 --> 1:00:04.600
Thank you.

1:00:06.169 --> 1:00:08.871
Ua, Yase, different story.

1:00:08.938 --> 1:00:11.507
Tribal Council tonight,
somebody will be voted out.

1:00:11.574 --> 1:00:13.910
Before you go,
I need your flint.

1:00:17.046 --> 1:00:20.249
Sorry for you. Sorry for you.

1:00:20.316 --> 1:00:22.018
Thank you.

All right, grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

1:00:26.422 --> 1:00:28.157
See you tonight

at them, so...

1:01:13.403 --> 1:01:14.771
LIANA:
No, seriously, I'm so sorry.

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:16.406
-You kicked ass.

sorry about?

-Are you kidding?
-LIANA: No, I...

I'm sorry.

<i>LIANA:</i>
<i>The first immunity challenge</i>

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:30.153

<i>but me and Tiffany want</i>
<i>to take out Abraham</i>

1:01:33.890 --> 1:01:36.259

1:01:36.325 --> 1:01:37.960

Mm-hmm, but... okay, but this

<i>-ABRAHAM: Tiffany.</i>

1:02:00.917 --> 1:02:02.852
I look at the first
challenge we did.

1:02:02.919 --> 1:02:05.221
We jumped off the boat.
Who was where?

-Yeah.

1:02:06.589 --> 1:02:09.058

-VOCE: Yeah.

<i>The physical demand</i>

that has been put on us

1:02:19.902 --> 1:02:23.539
<i>And so, looking at it,</i>
<i>having strength</i>

1:02:23.606 --> 1:02:25.942
is an asset
while we can still preserve it.

-XANDER: No.

1:02:27.844 --> 1:02:30.146

of how to execute my job.

1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:40.056

it's gonna make us stronger.

"I don't think you make
any sense when you talk,"

1:11:56.845 --> 1:11:58.781

I know what I bring."

he might be reading it right.

1:12:02.685 --> 1:12:04.253

1:12:14.596 --> 1:12:16.865
and we definitely don't want
to get down to four.

1:12:16.932 --> 1:12:18.467
So, I mean,
I think challenge strength

1:12:18.534 --> 1:12:19.802
is extremely important.

1:12:19.868 --> 1:12:22.104
PROBST:
Voce, the Shot in the Dark.

1:12:22.171 --> 1:12:24.006
New twist.

1:12:24.073 --> 1:12:26.141
Walk up there to vote,
nobody knows if you're

1:12:26.208 --> 1:12:28.077
going to vote,
play your Shot in the Dark.

1:12:28.143 --> 1:12:30.012
They don't know
what you're gonna do.

1:12:30.079 --> 1:12:33.515
But it could mess everything up
if you draw that 17% shot

1:12:33.582 --> 1:12:35.184
and you're safe.

1:12:35.250 --> 1:12:36.952
16.7.

1:12:37.019 --> 1:12:38.287
Thank you.

1:12:38.353 --> 1:12:40.622
-(laughter)
-I love that.

1:12:40.689 --> 1:12:42.624
I'm just glad I got close at 17.

1:12:42.691 --> 1:12:44.126
I was guessing.

1:12:44.193 --> 1:12:48.363
So, Mr. Math Expert, at 16.7%,

1:12:48.430 --> 1:12:50.833
how does the Shot in the Dark
change the game?

1:12:50.899 --> 1:12:53.569
Yeah, I think the idea of it
is terrifying

1:12:53.635 --> 1:12:57.573
because if I'm in danger,
I'm gonna take that shot.

1:12:57.639 --> 1:13:00.542
But at the end of the day, if
you think through it logically,

1:13:00.609 --> 1:13:03.779
I don't think it's actually
as scary as what it is.

1:13:03.846 --> 1:13:05.614
Liana, that is
the kind of answer that,

1:13:05.681 --> 1:13:07.883
if somebody said it to me,
I would think,

1:13:07.950 --> 1:13:09.818
"I should probably take
my Shot in the Dark.

1:13:09.885 --> 1:13:13.155
That sounds like they're trying
to get me off the scent."

1:13:13.222 --> 1:13:15.924
Yeah, if you are somebody
that feels like you are

1:13:15.991 --> 1:13:18.494
on the minority,
you get this sliver of power,

1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:20.496
and so that can cause
a ton of chaos,

1:13:20.562 --> 1:13:22.731
you know, whether that be
a revote or somebody that's

1:13:22.798 --> 1:13:25.534
top dog in the majority alliance
is suddenly gone.

1:13:25.601 --> 1:13:27.936
Like, it can completely
stir up the game.

1:13:28.003 --> 1:13:29.705
PROBST:
Xander, how will tonight's vote,

1:13:29.772 --> 1:13:32.341
if it goes the way
you think it's gonna go,

1:13:32.407 --> 1:13:34.376
make this tribe better?

1:13:34.443 --> 1:13:37.379
I think that this tribe has
gotten a bitter taste of loss,

1:13:37.446 --> 1:13:39.715
and maybe the other tribes
see us as something less,

1:13:39.782 --> 1:13:42.751
but I want to be able
to show them

1:13:42.818 --> 1:13:44.653
that we're not a David tribe.

1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:46.155
This is a strong tribe

1:13:46.221 --> 1:13:48.056
that works together
really, really well.

1:13:48.123 --> 1:13:50.425
Somebody from the David tribe
won that season.

1:13:50.492 --> 1:13:52.694
-Right.
-That's true.

1:13:52.761 --> 1:13:54.797
-PROBST: Evvie,
how about for you?
-EVVIE: As everyone's saying,

1:13:54.863 --> 1:13:56.465
we're really cohesive as it is,

1:13:56.532 --> 1:13:59.668
and I really think that we'll
leave here even more cohesive.

1:13:59.735 --> 1:14:02.204
If we leave this Tribal
strong as a tribe,

1:14:02.271 --> 1:14:04.506
able to do everything
we got to do around camp,

1:14:04.573 --> 1:14:06.809
able to win in challenges,
we'll be so much better off

1:14:06.875 --> 1:14:09.845
for the later part of this game
when we, like, critically

1:14:09.912 --> 1:14:13.248
will need each other,
you know, just as we do now.

1:14:13.315 --> 1:14:15.250

It's time to vote?

Jeff, we would trade you
a machete

1:17:46.828 --> 1:17:48.463
and our last pot if you'd just

1:17:48.530 --> 1:17:50.365
kind of let us stay

I'm sorry to disappoint you.

1:17:52.134 --> 1:17:53.769
-(laughter)
-So, Shan,

1:17:53.835 --> 1:17:56.038
yesterday,
one person from your tribe

1:17:56.104 --> 1:17:57.839
had to leave the tribe,
get on a boat.

1:17:57.906 --> 1:18:00.542
What are you thinking when you
have to make that decision?

1:18:00.609 --> 1:18:04.546
Oh, well, like he said,
we are a very namaste tribe.

1:18:04.613 --> 1:18:06.581
And so we're like,
"Let's get democratic,"

1:18:06.648 --> 1:18:08.183
and we pulled rocks and...

1:18:08.250 --> 1:18:11.453
JD knew that if he came
back here without any rice,

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:12.988
we're gonna know
you have an item,

1:18:13.055 --> 1:18:14.289
we're gonna vote you out.

1:18:14.356 --> 1:18:16.625
And that's why I said,
"Check my bag,"

1:18:16.691 --> 1:18:19.761
at the very start--
'cause I did tell them

1:18:19.828 --> 1:18:21.196
that I had a chance
to get an advantage,

1:18:21.263 --> 1:18:22.631
and I told them
exactly what it was.

1:18:22.697 --> 1:18:26.234
And to risk my vote
on the first vote?

1:18:26.301 --> 1:18:28.370
I didn't think
that was very smart.

1:18:28.437 --> 1:18:31.573
And so I told them my decision
to protect my vote, so...

1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:33.208
SARA:
You do have to be skeptical

1:18:33.275 --> 1:18:35.744
when someone shows back up
with nothing in their hands

1:18:35.811 --> 1:18:37.379
when typically
something like this,

1:18:37.446 --> 1:18:39.081
they have an opportunity
to get something.

1:18:39.147 --> 1:18:40.982
You're taking the word
of someone you don't know.

1:18:41.049 --> 1:18:43.185
-And I'm not saying
I don't believe him...
-JD: Yeah, yeah.

1:18:43.251 --> 1:18:44.786
...but I'm just saying
you have to have

1:18:44.853 --> 1:18:47.089
some skepticism in this game.

1:18:47.155 --> 1:18:48.824
PROBST:
Let's talk about
today's challenge.

1:18:48.890 --> 1:18:50.725
Looked to me, Sara,
that it came down

1:18:50.792 --> 1:18:52.627
to one piece that was missing,

1:18:52.694 --> 1:18:54.830
but it was a piece you needed
in order to continue.

1:18:54.896 --> 1:18:56.765
What happened?
How'd you discover it?

1:18:56.832 --> 1:19:00.635
Yeah, so we got, like, a pretty
good start on that puzzle.

1:19:00.702 --> 1:19:03.371
Those pieces were
flying together at first and...

1:19:03.438 --> 1:19:05.040
-You were in the lead.
-Yeah, we were in the lead,

1:19:05.107 --> 1:19:07.609
and that one piece
connected the side

1:19:07.676 --> 1:19:08.910
to the rest of the puzzle.

1:19:08.977 --> 1:19:11.346
And, like, that's a mistake,

1:19:11.413 --> 1:19:13.281
and that could have
been avoided.

1:19:13.348 --> 1:19:15.383
In<i> Survivor</i> season 41,

1:19:15.450 --> 1:19:17.853
there is no room
for mistakes like that.

1:19:17.919 --> 1:19:19.387
You know, we just...
we're learning that this is

1:19:19.454 --> 1:19:21.456
-a new era for real.
-GENIE: And also the fact that,

1:19:21.523 --> 1:19:24.259
like, there's only one immunity,
uh, you know,

1:19:24.326 --> 1:19:26.027
like, to-to win? Like...

1:19:26.094 --> 1:19:28.230
-What is that, Jeff? I mean...
-GENIE: We. I mean...

1:19:28.296 --> 1:19:30.398
-(laughter)
-SARA: Namaste.

1:19:30.465 --> 1:19:33.535
PROBST:
That is why<i> Survivor</i> is
so compelling,

1:19:33.602 --> 1:19:35.971
and the stakes are high
when you're on a tribe of six.

1:19:36.037 --> 1:19:37.906
So regardless whether
it's Sara and Shan's fault

1:19:37.973 --> 1:19:39.708
or they get credit
for stepping up doesn't matter.

1:19:39.774 --> 1:19:41.009
Somebody's going home.

1:19:41.076 --> 1:19:42.711
JD, what kind of criteria

1:19:42.777 --> 1:19:44.746
starts kicking in for you,
in terms of...

1:19:44.813 --> 1:19:47.983
What do you want to be
after tonight's vote?

1:19:48.049 --> 1:19:50.986
Right, your-your mindset
fluctuates

1:19:51.052 --> 1:19:53.255
because if you feel as though
you're on the bottom,

1:19:53.321 --> 1:19:55.657
like, my criteria is very low,

1:19:55.724 --> 1:19:58.593
but if you are
kind of running things

1:19:58.660 --> 1:20:00.462
and you got
the best relationships,

1:20:00.529 --> 1:20:02.164
now you have a little leeway.

1:20:02.230 --> 1:20:04.166
You can choose
who you want to go home.

1:20:04.232 --> 1:20:06.668
And so I think...
I think everybody

1:20:06.735 --> 1:20:08.203
talked to everybody
at one point,

1:20:08.270 --> 1:20:10.238
and-and I also think that...

1:20:10.305 --> 1:20:11.673
-Does that concern you at all?
-JD: Yeah.

1:20:11.740 --> 1:20:14.209
Yeah, that's terrifying
right there.

1:20:14.276 --> 1:20:15.577
Maybe some plans are changing.

1:20:15.644 --> 1:20:17.179
And that's what
I was about to say,

1:20:17.245 --> 1:20:19.014
was that I think everybody's
name was thrown out

1:20:19.080 --> 1:20:20.482
at least one time.

1:20:20.549 --> 1:20:23.685
Okay, but mine was thrown out
to my face multiple times.

1:20:23.752 --> 1:20:26.388
So, out of everyone here,
Brad comes over

1:20:26.454 --> 1:20:30.025
and says, "Well, we think
it's got to be Sara or Shan."

1:20:30.091 --> 1:20:31.860
Like, you know, we got to stay
strong, and it's like...

1:20:31.927 --> 1:20:34.229
Are we about to make this
a live Tribal?

1:20:34.296 --> 1:20:35.697
-SARA: I mean...
-JD: I'm down.

1:20:35.764 --> 1:20:37.933
Like, we're already whispering
over here, and I thought...

1:20:37.999 --> 1:20:39.868
I've heard that I'm
on the block tonight, and I...

1:20:39.935 --> 1:20:41.603
BRAD: I just threw up
two names because,

1:20:41.670 --> 1:20:43.939
though that was the puzzle, what
Jeff was talking about earlier.

1:20:44.005 --> 1:20:45.407
I get it.

1:20:45.473 --> 1:20:47.375
"Okay, those two are on the
block." You know what I mean?

1:20:47.442 --> 1:20:49.978
And I-I try to...

1:20:50.045 --> 1:20:51.813
play that straight, but...

1:20:53.548 --> 1:20:55.383
GENIE:
I-I mean, it was...

1:20:55.450 --> 1:20:58.386
-No matter whose name...
-Yeah, this is, uh...

1:20:58.453 --> 1:20:59.888
JD:
Let's get it started.

1:21:02.724 --> 1:21:04.993
RICARD: So the point I was
trying to make earlier, though,

1:21:05.060 --> 1:21:07.128
the puzzle piece,
that's old-school.

1:21:07.195 --> 1:21:09.397
We blame the people
who messed up, made one mistake.

1:21:09.464 --> 1:21:12.267
But we need to work
with people we can trust.

RICARD: Maybe think about
future challenges.

1:21:15.537 --> 1:21:17.339
Maybe names you throw out

1:21:17.405 --> 1:21:19.541
and the paranoia you cause,
that's what I'm more

when you see on TV,

1:21:55.076 --> 1:21:57.012
you hear the conversations,
right?

1:21:57.078 --> 1:21:59.481
But, like, once again,

1:21:59.547 --> 1:22:02.017
I'm hearing different things
than what I was back at camp.

1:22:02.083 --> 1:22:05.954
So either now or then,
people were feeding me bull.

1:22:06.021 --> 1:22:07.722
-Mm-hmm.
-JD: Now I have to decipher

1:22:07.789 --> 1:22:10.058
whether or not
what they said then was true

1:22:10.125 --> 1:22:11.559
or what they say now is true.

1:22:11.626 --> 1:22:13.695
I don't quite understand
the paranoia, man.

1:22:13.762 --> 1:22:15.297
-JD: From me?
-BRAD: Yeah.

1:22:15.363 --> 1:22:16.731

1:22:16.798 --> 1:22:18.733
-I thought we were cool.

Jeff, can all of us put our die

1:22:27.842 --> 1:22:29.277
Absolutely.

1:22:33.415 --> 1:22:36.217
-Do you have it close?
-I already put it in my pocket.

Jeff, tonight's gonna be a...

1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:41.690
a Saturday night at Las Vegas,
maybe, up there.
