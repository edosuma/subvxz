00:13.063 --> 00:14.587
What's her name?

00:16.065 --> 00:19.797
Whoever you're thinking about,
your girlfriend or whatever.

00:22.238 --> 00:24.638
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Yeah?

00:27.043 --> 00:29.068
What's in the bag?

00:29.245 --> 00:30.610
Oh, is it a pizza?

00:30.780 --> 00:33.681
Because I could really go
for a mushroom pizza.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.650
Yeah, it's a mushroom pizza.

00:37.053 --> 00:38.645
Awesome.

00:44.327 --> 00:46.625
You're not married, are you?

00:46.796 --> 00:48.730
Not that it's any of my business.

00:48.898 --> 00:51.366
You never know about people.

00:52.335 --> 00:54.326
My name isn't Amber, by the way.

00:54.504 --> 00:56.267
Obviously.

00:56.439 --> 00:58.134
That's just for the club.

01:00.376 --> 01:02.401
Wanna know my real name or what?

01:02.579 --> 01:05.513
Yes, I do. Very much.

01:06.015 --> 01:07.915
Loraine.

01:08.218 --> 01:12.120
Ready for this? Loraine Daisy.

01:12.355 --> 01:15.722
All my sisters have flowers
for middle names.

01:16.259 --> 01:19.228
My mom couldn't even
spell Loraine right.

01:31.107 --> 01:32.438
What's...?

01:39.949 --> 01:41.780
- What is it?
- I don't know.

01:42.952 --> 01:45.386
- What is it?
- Oh, God, what's happening?

01:48.758 --> 01:50.521
It'll be over in a second. Hold on.

02:05.942 --> 02:09.002
I want you to get up.
Try and get up. Try and get up.

02:09.179 --> 02:11.079
Everything okay?

02:11.247 --> 02:13.010
You need a lift to the hospital?
I got a van.

02:13.183 --> 02:14.775
Thanks, I'll take her. I'll take her.

02:25.829 --> 02:27.421
What's happening to me?

02:49.652 --> 02:51.620
Don't leave me!

02:54.424 --> 02:56.221
Okay, everything's gonna be fine.

02:56.392 --> 02:58.087
- How'd you get here?
- All right?

02:58.261 --> 03:01.094
- Let's get her to Operating Room 2.
- Take a deep breath.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.664
- How many months are you?
- How many months what?

03:03.833 --> 03:06.666
- Pregnant.
- I'm not... I'm not pregnant.

03:06.836 --> 03:08.667
Hold her down. We gotta strap her in.

03:10.206 --> 03:12.197
We gotta cut this baby out now, doctor.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.275
No time for anesthetic.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.708
BP's 60, pulse is thready.

03:22.151 --> 03:23.379
What the hell was that?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.712
- We lost her heartbeat.
- Go for the baby.

03:25.889 --> 03:27.447
- Give me a scalpel.
- Scalpel.

03:31.227 --> 03:33.559
- Are you getting anything?
- All right, come on.

03:35.064 --> 03:36.292
That's good.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.831
On two.

04:19.809 --> 04:22.437
Thank you all
for convening at this late hour.

04:22.612 --> 04:25.172
Forty-three minutes ago,
we were alerted to an incident

04:25.348 --> 04:27.111
at Wallace Bromley Medical Center.

04:27.283 --> 04:31.185
While the details are still coming in,
it appears to be another anomaly...

04:31.354 --> 04:35.120
...whose mysteries and origins
remain the sole purpose of this committee.

04:35.491 --> 04:37.959
I've called you together tonight
to introduce you to my team...

04:38.594 --> 04:41.825
...who I've tasked to assist us
in our investigation of these events.

04:41.998 --> 04:44.466
Hopefully, they'll have more success
than our last.

04:46.069 --> 04:47.434
Walter Bishop...

04:47.603 --> 04:51.471
...dubbed by his contemporaries
as the successor to Albert Einstein.

04:51.641 --> 04:55.099
Worked for the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency from the late '70s...

04:55.278 --> 04:58.941
Until he was committed to the St. Claire's
Mental Institution for manslaughter.

04:59.115 --> 05:02.243
- He was never convicted of that crime.
- But in one of your own reports...

05:02.418 --> 05:04.682
...you theorized
that Bishop's previous work...

05:04.854 --> 05:08.017
...may itself be the root
of all these unexplained phenomena.

05:08.191 --> 05:11.058
Given that he's been
hugging a padded cell for 17 years...

05:11.227 --> 05:13.593
...I think we can probably exclude him
as a suspect.

05:13.930 --> 05:17.331
However, his knowledge makes him
uniquely qualified to assist our efforts...

05:17.500 --> 05:19.934
...while he remains
in the legal custody of his son, Peter.

05:20.103 --> 05:21.764
Yes, Peter Bishop...

05:21.938 --> 05:25.965
...whose history of questionable
business practices verge on fraud.

05:26.142 --> 05:28.736
Yet you propose giving him
access to information...

05:28.911 --> 05:31.607
...that if made public
would cause mass panic.

05:31.781 --> 05:34.272
Nothing we could tell him
that he can't learn from his father...

05:34.450 --> 05:35.940
...or deduce himself with a 190 IQ.

05:36.119 --> 05:38.781
What were you thinking
when you recruited Olivia Dunham?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.855
An FBI agent
who had an illicit affair with her partner...

05:44.027 --> 05:45.824
...a man who turned out to be a traitor.

05:45.995 --> 05:49.055
I was thinking that a woman
who didn't hesitate to follow evidence...

05:49.232 --> 05:52.793
...and expose the man she loved at the cost
of great personal pain and embarrassment...

05:52.969 --> 05:55.938
...must surely be worthy of our trust.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.639
I love you.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.631
Who? Who are you working for?

06:30.273 --> 06:32.104
- Hello?
- Wake up.

06:32.275 --> 06:34.300
There's something you need to see.

06:34.477 --> 06:38.106
Well, waking up is not gonna be a problem,
but thank you for the gentle nudge.

06:38.281 --> 06:39.407
Pick up the others...

06:39.582 --> 06:42.244
...and meet me in 30 minutes
at the Bromley Medical Center.

06:43.786 --> 06:45.481
Well, good morning to you too.

06:50.526 --> 06:52.858
- You're kidding me, right?
- Your phone was off the hook.

06:53.029 --> 06:55.054
It's because I didn't wanna
get woken up.

06:55.231 --> 06:56.459
You need to get your father.

06:56.632 --> 06:58.395
Apparently, there's something
we need to see.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.360
- And this something...?
- It can't wait.

07:02.705 --> 07:05.037
Okay. Walter?

07:05.208 --> 07:07.267
Hey, Walter, come on. We gotta...

07:07.510 --> 07:09.137
Walter?

07:10.146 --> 07:12.876
Aw, come on.

07:14.083 --> 07:17.348
Tell me you're not in the closet.

07:19.722 --> 07:22.282
What the hell
are you doing in there again?

07:22.458 --> 07:27.486
Where I've been for the past 17 years,
it was a mental hospital.

07:27.663 --> 07:31.190
St. Claire's. I'm the one
that got you out of that place, remember?

07:33.436 --> 07:36.371
There was a patient there. Carlos.

07:37.740 --> 07:43.110
He would sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"
every night.

07:43.679 --> 07:46.170
Funny how difficult it is to sleep
without that song.

07:46.349 --> 07:48.214
That's nice.

07:48.484 --> 07:49.746
We gotta go, Walter.

07:53.923 --> 07:56.221
Hey, I got here fast as we could.

07:57.426 --> 07:59.223
Twenty-seven minutes. Nicely done.

08:01.130 --> 08:04.759
Peter Bishop? I'm Phillip Broyles,
Department of Homeland Security.

08:04.934 --> 08:06.799
Thank you for agreeing to work with us.

08:06.969 --> 08:08.994
Just to be clear,
I haven't agreed to anything.

08:09.172 --> 08:11.766
I'm just here as the babysitter.
My father is the one you want.

08:12.308 --> 08:14.276
Nice to meet you, anyway.

08:14.443 --> 08:16.911
- Is he coming out?
- Well, that's unclear.

08:17.079 --> 08:20.276
He's currently in the car
fiddling around with the seat warmer.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.250
Dr. Bishop, hello.
I appreciate you coming out tonight.

08:29.058 --> 08:31.925
I've never seen a feature like this before.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.722
It warms your ass. It's wonderful.

08:35.898 --> 08:36.922
Have you tried it?

08:38.067 --> 08:40.193
Seventeen past midnight,
a woman, pregnant to term...

08:40.369 --> 08:42.462
...was found alone outside the hospital.

08:42.638 --> 08:45.266
She collapsed,
suffering severe abdominal pain.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.672
She's a Jane Doe.

08:47.843 --> 08:51.006
Prints and DNA are being run now.
Should have her ID'd by sundown.

08:51.180 --> 08:54.946
At 12:24, less than two minutes
after she was pronounced dead...

08:55.117 --> 08:56.550
...Ms. Doe became a mother.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.045
Did the baby survive?

08:58.221 --> 09:01.281
The newborn was convulsing,
screaming in obvious pain.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.651
They placed it in a bassinet...

09:02.825 --> 09:05.350
...were in the process
of transferring it to an Intensive Care...

09:05.528 --> 09:09.965
...when they realized what was happening.
It was growing. Before their eyes.

09:10.132 --> 09:13.693
Growing? You mean,
they could see it getting larger?

09:14.303 --> 09:15.497
That's right.

09:15.671 --> 09:17.229
So where's the baby now?

09:21.143 --> 09:22.201
Walter.

09:22.378 --> 09:26.212
It remained alive for nearly half an hour,
finally dying from natural causes.

09:26.382 --> 09:29.112
Natural causes? I don't understand.

09:29.285 --> 09:34.086
What they realized is that the child
wasn't just growing, it was aging.

09:35.858 --> 09:38.827
Uh, okay, hold on a sec.
It's 4 a.m., so I'm a little foggy...

09:38.995 --> 09:43.659
...but we're supposed to believe
that Grandpa here was born four hours ago?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.630
Were there any calls or tips?

09:45.801 --> 09:47.860
Security cameras see
how the pregnant woman got here?

09:48.037 --> 09:50.369
Did she drive herself
or was she dropped off?

09:50.539 --> 09:52.404
We're checking those now.

09:52.575 --> 09:55.669
Dr. Bishop, any idea
how something like this might happen?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.109
I think you're probably expecting
a bit much, Mr. Broyles.

09:58.281 --> 09:59.543
Celermitosis.

09:59.715 --> 10:02.775
Disabling, reversing cell-cycle inhibitors.

10:02.952 --> 10:09.187
Activating them, turning Cip/Kip
and INK4a/ ARFs into catalysts.

10:09.492 --> 10:14.088
Ninety-two percent of Caucasian newborns
have blue eyes.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.862
Yours were green.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.398
To understand what happened here...

10:18.567 --> 10:21.297
...I'll need to run extensive tests,
get these bodies to a lab.

10:21.771 --> 10:24.239
Therefore, of course,
I'll need a lab immediately.

10:24.407 --> 10:26.466
Doctor, you have one.

10:27.476 --> 10:30.673
Your old lab at Harvard,
we reopened it for you.

10:30.846 --> 10:31.972
Do you not remember that?

10:32.581 --> 10:34.139
No.

10:35.651 --> 10:37.551
No, but that's fantastic news.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.781
All right, let's assume for a second
that bundle of joy here is for real.

10:41.957 --> 10:43.288
What are we doing here?

10:45.795 --> 10:47.524
A series of events has occurred...

10:47.697 --> 10:51.292
Continues to occur.
- That has us and other agencies on alert.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.367
These events appear to be
scientific in nature...

10:53.536 --> 10:56.767
...and suggest a larger strategy,
a coordinated effort.

10:56.939 --> 10:58.531
It's being referred to as "the Pattern."

10:59.041 --> 11:01.305
Mr. Broyles,
I consider myself a fairly intelligent guy...

11:02.678 --> 11:04.270
...but I'm not following.
- Hello?

11:04.447 --> 11:06.438
Inexplicable and frightening things
are happening...

11:06.615 --> 11:08.173
...and there's a connection somehow.

11:08.351 --> 11:10.342
- Just a second.
- That much I understand.

11:10.519 --> 11:11.952
I got Henning on the phone.

11:12.121 --> 11:14.612
The hospital got a call from a guest
at the Scarlet Red Motel...

11:14.790 --> 11:17.088
...checking to see
if the pregnant woman was doing okay.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.283
Was she staying there?

11:18.461 --> 11:20.520
Yes, with a Caucasian male,
20s, brown hair...

11:20.696 --> 11:23.164
...but there's no description of him
or the car he was driving.

11:23.332 --> 11:26.529
Call the motel. Make sure they don't
touch anything. They shouldn't even go in.

11:26.702 --> 11:29.865
I already called and you're good to go.
The motel room is empty and locked.

11:30.039 --> 11:33.998
Dr. Bishop? I may need you
to take samples from the motel room.

11:34.176 --> 11:35.837
I need you to come with me.

11:38.314 --> 11:40.111
- Walter.
- Do you see what I'm doing here?

11:40.282 --> 11:41.544
Hey. Relax.

11:41.717 --> 11:44.777
I can't figure this out
with a girl buzzing in my ear.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.388
I am trying to put these pieces together,
like a puzzle.

11:47.556 --> 11:50.354
How this happened,
how he happened to her. I'm working.

11:50.526 --> 11:52.255
Come on, Olivia.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.951
I can do this.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.759
My limited stint at MIT
did teach me something.

12:20.689 --> 12:22.657
"Loraine Daisy Alcott."

12:23.058 --> 12:24.355
Loraine Daisy.

12:24.927 --> 12:26.155
That's just sad.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.920
One R.

12:30.900 --> 12:35.234
Hey. I think I actually
got something to sample in here.

12:43.212 --> 12:45.840
It's some kind of orange gel.

12:50.753 --> 12:53.085
Sorry about my father.

12:54.623 --> 12:57.251
He always was a little myopic.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.924
Her things were left behind, but not his.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.762
Checking the thread count?

13:07.169 --> 13:08.431
Yes.

13:10.773 --> 13:12.934
- Open the cabinet.
- Why?

13:13.108 --> 13:14.871
There are gonna be sheets in there.

13:19.615 --> 13:22.049
Okay, how'd you do that?

13:24.320 --> 13:27.153
Hey. Car's right here.

13:28.257 --> 13:30.316
Olivia. What's going on?

13:30.493 --> 13:32.791
That's what he would do.
He'd go to motels ahead of time...

13:32.962 --> 13:35.453
...to replace the sheets
with leak-proof, medical-grade linen...

13:35.631 --> 13:37.189
...so he wouldn't leave blood evidence.

13:37.366 --> 13:40.028
- Who?
- I know who was in that room.

13:40.202 --> 13:42.898
The killer, I know his profile.
It was a case that John and I worked.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.337
Serial murders in New Jersey and New York
and we never caught him.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.939
You can't beat yourself up because you
didn't catch the bastard on your first try.

13:50.112 --> 13:52.171
I feel like I've been asleep
for the last year.

13:52.381 --> 13:54.178
Every case that John and I
worked together...

13:54.350 --> 13:57.114
...I have to go back
and try and find whatever I missed.

13:58.721 --> 14:00.712
Okay, then tell me.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.482
How'd the killer do it?

14:11.700 --> 14:12.997
When I joined the FBI...

14:13.168 --> 14:16.331
...this was one of the cases
John and I investigated together.

14:16.505 --> 14:19.599
Each time, he'd kill five young women
within a few days.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.709
He'd pick them up,
take them to motels...

14:21.877 --> 14:24.471
...and then he'd give them
a muscle paralyzer.

14:24.647 --> 14:27.207
They'd be wide awake
but unable to move.

14:27.383 --> 14:30.250
He'd make an incision here,
along their gums.

14:30.419 --> 14:33.115
And then he'd pull their mouths open
up to their eyes.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.916
Okay. That's enough. You can stop...

14:35.090 --> 14:38.685
He'd go through their nasal cavity
and remove a piece of their brain.

14:38.861 --> 14:41.694
And all of this connects
to Magic Old-Man Baby...

14:41.897 --> 14:43.694
...and the pregnant woman how?

14:43.866 --> 14:45.595
I don't know.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.098
But there's a connection somewhere.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.670
The muscle paralyzer he used
was bright orange.

14:51.373 --> 14:53.841
So if that's our sample,
then I'm telling you, this is our guy.

14:54.443 --> 14:56.035
Which...

14:56.879 --> 14:59.177
...means he's gonna kill again.

15:25.207 --> 15:26.697
I'm Stacey.

15:31.847 --> 15:35.578
Memorial services for Agent Scott
are being planned for late next week.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.685
I know everybody's heard
a lot of things...

15:37.853 --> 15:40.720
...surrounding the circumstances
of his death...

15:40.923 --> 15:42.914
...but I just wanna be clear:

15:43.359 --> 15:45.725
John Scott was one of us.

15:45.894 --> 15:48.624
And we will pay him the respect
of considering him innocent...

15:48.797 --> 15:52.699
...until the inquiry can establish
the full facts of the matter.

15:53.969 --> 15:55.903
Now, as far as any contacts...

15:56.071 --> 15:58.539
...our official word right now
is "no comment."

15:59.441 --> 16:01.102
Dismissed.

16:01.410 --> 16:02.638
What are you doing here?

16:03.012 --> 16:04.912
- I left you a message.
- You know, I got it.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.275
You wanna open up
a 12-year-old serial case.

16:07.449 --> 16:08.609
The brain surgeon.

16:08.784 --> 16:10.274
I don't think he retired.

16:10.452 --> 16:13.216
How long is Broyles gonna have you
on special assignment?

16:16.358 --> 16:19.054
The hell are you working on, anyway?

16:19.928 --> 16:22.362
You knew, didn't you?

16:22.698 --> 16:23.756
About me and John?

16:23.932 --> 16:26.765
I'd like to think that I have
some powers of deduction.

16:27.369 --> 16:29.428
I took advantage of our friendship.

16:29.605 --> 16:31.971
You kept quiet
even though you didn't approve.

16:32.141 --> 16:34.132
Hadn't seen you that happy
in a long time.

16:36.145 --> 16:40.411
- Look, Olivia, you have nothing to prove.
- Yeah, I do.

16:41.083 --> 16:45.247
I have to live with the fact that
I didn't see him for who he really was.

16:45.921 --> 16:50.585
I have to live with the feeling
that whatever awful things he did...

16:50.759 --> 16:51.919
...I should've stopped them.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.118
Livvy, you can nev...

16:53.295 --> 16:56.196
Mostly, I just wanna take a shower
from the inside out.

16:59.301 --> 17:01.667
I'll get you the case files.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.027
So I started working there
a couple weeks ago.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.939
It's a lot better
than the one in Providence.

17:38.107 --> 17:40.871
That place is a total dive.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.412
Heh, most guys bring me to a hotel.

17:45.547 --> 17:47.481
Wow.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.744
Look at this place.

17:52.755 --> 17:56.213
Those windows have
a really great view of the bridge.

17:59.595 --> 18:02.393
I don't care about the bridge.

18:04.366 --> 18:06.527
What do you like?

18:07.870 --> 18:09.337
I like the bridge.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.204
Go check it out.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.869
Humph.

19:08.297 --> 19:09.559
Hello?

19:10.365 --> 19:12.265
Over here.

19:13.268 --> 19:15.065
Over here.

19:19.341 --> 19:20.672
What are you doing?

19:22.311 --> 19:24.643
I'm doing two things at once:

19:24.813 --> 19:27.577
I'm waiting for you
and I'm doing her a favor.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.683
You were supposed to be doing
extensive testing.

19:30.452 --> 19:33.785
Our 80-year-old man-baby.
Remember that?

19:34.256 --> 19:35.280
Done.

19:35.457 --> 19:39.086
Tests complete. You underestimate me.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.158
Which I suppose I deserve.

19:43.031 --> 19:44.726
But...

19:45.100 --> 19:47.568
...wonderful news all round.

19:47.736 --> 19:52.070
DNA results confirm my suspicions
that the woman was impregnated...

19:52.241 --> 19:54.675
...by a man
who is the result of experiments...

19:54.843 --> 19:59.780
...identical to those conducted by me
in this very lab around 30 years ago.

19:59.948 --> 20:03.611
- So you know how this happened.
- No. No idea.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.117
Uh, the specifics elude me completely.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.188
So then what's this wonderful news?

20:08.357 --> 20:10.188
Because I remembered something else.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.894
I remembered where I parked my car.

20:14.429 --> 20:15.589
Really?

20:15.764 --> 20:19.495
You remember where
you parked your car 17 years ago.

20:26.708 --> 20:31.042
Three, one, four, one, five, nine.

20:32.781 --> 20:34.009
Pi to six digits.

20:38.086 --> 20:40.987
I can't fathom that it's still here.
Look at it.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.881
This is your car?

20:44.593 --> 20:45.651
Of course it is.

20:46.194 --> 20:48.958
So, what, you got cars stuffed with papers
all over town?

20:49.164 --> 20:50.961
Not just cars.

20:51.133 --> 20:54.034
You have no idea
where I've hidden things.

21:00.075 --> 21:01.474
Friend of yours?

21:01.643 --> 21:04.168
Oh. I certainly hope not.

21:08.050 --> 21:11.178
Come on, boy. We need to get
these file boxes back to the lab.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.720
You may be able to reanimate
dead guinea pigs or whatever...

21:14.890 --> 21:18.724
...but I can bring anything mechanical
back from the dead.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.286
- This is the last of them.
- Nope.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.892
No. Hello, I'm Dr. Walter Bishop.

21:57.366 --> 22:00.494
Yes, Dr. Bishop, we've met.
I'm Junior Agent Astrid Farnsworth.

22:00.969 --> 22:02.766
Third time's the charm.

22:02.938 --> 22:06.430
You know, we'd be a lot more help to you
if you told us what we were looking for.

22:06.608 --> 22:07.632
My research.

22:07.809 --> 22:12.473
Sella turcica, diaphragma sellae,
the dural folds of the pituitary fossa...

22:12.647 --> 22:16.378
...in which the pituitary gland sits,
situated in the sphenoid bone...

22:16.551 --> 22:18.451
Did you just say "pituitary gland"?

22:19.888 --> 22:20.912
Did I?

22:21.089 --> 22:22.579
Well, that's how he killed.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.625
He'd perform surgery on his victims,
remove the pituitary gland...

22:25.794 --> 22:27.853
...before he overdosed them
with anesthesia.

22:31.033 --> 22:34.025
Look for anything with "pituitary" in it.

22:34.202 --> 22:35.692
I'm sorry, I don't get it.

22:35.871 --> 22:38.271
I mean, what's the link
to what happened at the hospital?

22:38.440 --> 22:41.375
Advanced rapid aging,
like the disease called progeria...

22:41.543 --> 22:46.640
...can be induced artificially
by manipulating the pituitary gland.

22:46.815 --> 22:50.114
P. Pituitary, P. P. Mm...

22:50.285 --> 22:52.515
All the hormones in the human body
that control growth...

22:52.687 --> 22:56.987
...which is aging, really, are in the brain,
and the pituitary gland is the boss.

22:57.159 --> 23:02.563
- Pinot. Pinto. Penny. Oh. Ha, yes, penny.
- Progeria.

23:02.731 --> 23:06.724
Case file by Dr. Penrose.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.501
Yes, Penrose. Penrose.

23:09.671 --> 23:12.868
I remember him.
A former colleague of mine.

23:13.041 --> 23:17.842
Although he suffered from severe
pseudofolliculitis nuchae.

23:18.013 --> 23:19.810
- Razor burn.
- He'll know.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.972
We ran experiments on rapid growth.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.243
Obviously, someone
has made a breakthrough...

23:24.419 --> 23:26.683
...and Penrose could lead us
to that person.

23:26.855 --> 23:28.322
Dr. Claus Penrose.

23:29.858 --> 23:33.259
He moved to the East Coast
two years ago.

23:33.895 --> 23:36.227
He's a professor at Boston College.

23:38.533 --> 23:40.660
- Agent Francis.
- Charlie, it's me.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.565
Dunham. What's up?

23:42.737 --> 23:45.137
I need a cross-check
of recent unsolved homicides.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.366
See if any bodies have turned up
with a missing pituitary gland.

23:48.543 --> 23:52.377
- Oh, you say the sweetest things.
- Only to you, Charlie.

23:52.547 --> 23:54.742
I'll get somebody on it.

24:47.435 --> 24:49.164
- Dr. Penrose.
- Yes?

24:49.604 --> 24:51.572
Agent Dunham, FBI.

24:53.175 --> 24:54.437
Can we ask you a few questions?

24:56.645 --> 24:58.169
Do you drink tea?

24:59.381 --> 25:00.643
The body you see there...

25:00.815 --> 25:03.340
...was photographed
only hours after being born.

25:05.520 --> 25:08.853
- Where's the mother?
- She died during childbirth.

25:09.024 --> 25:12.357
When she was admitted,
she claimed she wasn't even pregnant.

25:12.527 --> 25:15.223
You worked with Dr. Bishop,
manipulating growth hormones...

25:15.397 --> 25:16.694
...at the end of the Vietnam War.

25:17.566 --> 25:19.033
Yes.

25:19.201 --> 25:21.669
So, what can I do for you?

25:22.137 --> 25:26.130
In the years since,
have you shared your research with anyone?

25:26.308 --> 25:31.268
- I must tell you both, our work was...
- Highly theoretical?

25:31.780 --> 25:36.080
Yes, but I was going to say that,
more than anything...

25:36.251 --> 25:38.481
...it was wrong.

25:40.422 --> 25:42.822
I resigned from the employ
of the United States government...

25:42.991 --> 25:45.221
...after only one year.

25:45.393 --> 25:46.883
When I refused to continue...

25:47.062 --> 25:52.227
...I was harassed,
threatened with deportation.

25:52.834 --> 25:54.267
Didn't feel like the America...

25:54.436 --> 25:59.840
...I remembered from when I was a boy.

26:01.910 --> 26:07.246
Which is why, as sorry as I was to hear
about Dr. Bishop's incarceration...

26:07.415 --> 26:10.851
...I believe it was the best thing
that could ever happen to humanity.

26:12.754 --> 26:17.214
No one in power
should ever learn what he knows.

26:21.696 --> 26:25.655
Forgive me for sounding uncooperative,
Agent Dunham...

26:26.134 --> 26:30.002
...but my work to which you are referring
ended years ago.

26:30.171 --> 26:35.006
Since then,
I've done all I can to forget it.

26:36.978 --> 26:39.276
- What do you think?
- I think you know what I think.

26:39.447 --> 26:42.541
- Yeah, he meant what he said.
- He's not telling us everything.

26:44.886 --> 26:45.910
Dunham.

26:46.087 --> 26:48.180
Sudbury Police has a blond, female victim.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.881
"Surgical incision
along her upper gum line.

26:51.059 --> 26:54.051
The central endocrine gland
has been removed."

26:54.229 --> 26:55.253
This count?

26:55.430 --> 26:58.024
- Can you get the body brought to the lab?
- Will do.

27:04.639 --> 27:08.302
Astrid called. She said you have news.

27:10.445 --> 27:11.912
You're right.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.811
The pituitary gland
has indeed been removed...

27:15.984 --> 27:19.044
...and I may be able to posit
an hypothesis as to why.

27:20.155 --> 27:23.750
Years ago, when I worked
with the Defense Department...

27:23.925 --> 27:28.988
...we were tasked with a program
designed to cultivate soldiers.

27:29.264 --> 27:30.788
"Cultivate"?

27:30.965 --> 27:34.059
Quite literally. Grow them.

27:34.369 --> 27:36.064
It was highly theoretical, of course.

27:36.237 --> 27:38.432
Female eggs
were to be fertilized in a lab...

27:38.606 --> 27:41.404
...and given a cocktail
of growth hormones.

27:41.576 --> 27:45.342
If perfected, a baby was born
and within three years...

27:45.513 --> 27:48.414
...aged to the equivalent
of a 21-year-old male.

27:48.583 --> 27:51.882
A soldier in prime condition.

27:52.854 --> 27:56.085
You're telling me you developed a way
to grow soldiers. People.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.281
Theoretically.

27:57.459 --> 28:00.121
The only problem was
how to slow the aging process...

28:00.295 --> 28:03.662
...once the subject had reached
the desired physical age.

28:03.865 --> 28:06.732
Once started,
we couldn't turn the aging off.

28:06.901 --> 28:10.701
So you think now, what, that the killer
somehow continued your work?

28:10.872 --> 28:14.069
Not exactly. But I believe that someone
has made a breakthrough.

28:14.242 --> 28:17.336
That the killer is the product:

28:17.512 --> 28:21.778
A test-tube human
afflicted with rapid aging.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.783
To slow the process,
he must extract the hormones...

28:24.953 --> 28:28.480
...from the pituitary glands
of his victims to treat himself.

28:28.656 --> 28:29.953
To stay young.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.920
- Then the pregnant woman at the hospital...
- She was an accident.

28:34.095 --> 28:36.154
And the killer's condition
was passed on to the baby.

28:36.331 --> 28:38.492
Even condoms
are not 100 percent effective.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.463
You two should be aware of this.

28:41.369 --> 28:44.998
That night, he was going to kill her,
but first they fornicated.

28:45.173 --> 28:47.869
- Had intercourse. Sex.
- Okay. We got it.

28:48.042 --> 28:52.843
She became pregnant, but the pregnancy
became horribly accelerated.

28:53.014 --> 28:55.812
Someone must've heard her scream.
He couldn't go through with his plan.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.008
He couldn't kill her.

28:57.185 --> 29:01.087
Which is why he didn't kill this girl
at a motel, because he was scared.

29:02.056 --> 29:05.753
And if his m.o. has changed,
then we have nothing.

29:05.927 --> 29:08.225
No, we have to go back
and start again from the beginning.

29:08.396 --> 29:11.058
- No, this is okay. We're making progress.
- Why don't you tell her...

29:11.232 --> 29:13.325
...that everything's going to be okay?

29:15.470 --> 29:17.335
I thought you had a way with women.

29:25.947 --> 29:27.778
Christopher!

29:32.320 --> 29:34.584
The FBI came to see me today.

29:36.324 --> 29:37.518
I know what happened.

29:37.692 --> 29:39.216
You got that woman pregnant.

29:44.799 --> 29:46.858
Son, we have to be so careful.

29:47.368 --> 29:48.392
I know.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.506
How's the pain?

29:52.874 --> 29:54.842
Getting worse.

29:55.276 --> 29:57.801
Yes. Well, we're almost there.

29:57.979 --> 30:01.847
You just need to get one more
and you'll be okay again.

30:07.288 --> 30:11.156
Yes, yes, yes.

30:11.326 --> 30:12.554
Something on your mind?

30:12.727 --> 30:17.824
Oh, please. The term "on your mind"
vexes me with its depictive inaccuracy.

30:17.999 --> 30:20.797
Oh, stop.
Would you just talk like a person?

30:20.969 --> 30:23.130
- What are you thinking?
- Jules Verne.

30:23.304 --> 30:25.397
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
Jules Verne?

30:25.573 --> 30:27.666
Yes. Although I was referring...

30:27.842 --> 30:31.573
...to his lesser-known masterwork
The Kip Brothers...

30:31.746 --> 30:36.513
...in which he posited
that the last image seen in life...

30:36.684 --> 30:39.050
...right at the moment of death...

30:39.220 --> 30:42.212
...is permanently imprinted
on the retina of the eye.

30:42.390 --> 30:46.451
Also a work of fiction,
which is a small but critical distinction.

30:50.632 --> 30:53.795
When was it
you lost your imagination, son?

30:57.739 --> 30:59.798
All right, you wanna play? Let's play.

31:00.408 --> 31:03.172
The only way that we could see
what she saw, even in theory...

31:03.344 --> 31:05.278
...is if we could recover
the electric impulses...

31:05.446 --> 31:07.937
...that were traveling along her optic nerve,
which we can't.

31:08.116 --> 31:13.349
Ah! But we're in luck.
This woman was given a muscle relaxant.

31:14.255 --> 31:16.655
The drug would've frozen
her neural pathways...

31:16.824 --> 31:21.090
...at the moment of death,
and the last images she saw with it.

31:21.262 --> 31:24.231
Okay, assuming we're actually having
this conversation...

31:24.399 --> 31:26.663
...we would still need a...

31:26.968 --> 31:29.869
I don't know, but we'd need something
that could translate what she saw...

31:30.038 --> 31:33.474
Something that could translate
from her eyes to a monitor.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.236
A TV screen.

31:48.590 --> 31:50.080
Hey.

31:58.099 --> 32:02.695
- I'm sorry about the lab. I don't usually...
- What?

32:02.870 --> 32:04.098
Lose control.

32:05.974 --> 32:08.442
To tell you the truth,
it was kind of a relief.

32:08.610 --> 32:10.908
You've been so together,
with everything that's going on...

32:11.079 --> 32:13.570
...I was starting to develop
an inferiority complex.

32:16.985 --> 32:19.954
Knowing that Walter's work
is responsible for all those murders...

32:21.789 --> 32:24.656
I just want you to know
that you're not alone here.

32:29.597 --> 32:32.964
Listen, heh, I can't believe
that I'm about to propose this...

32:33.134 --> 32:38.731
...but I think we've actually figured out
a way to track down that psycho.

32:39.941 --> 32:42.808
- How?
- Well, we need a piece of equipment.

32:42.977 --> 32:46.936
It's a laser-optic hardware.
Very crazy and very, very hard to find...

32:47.115 --> 32:51.381
...but as it turns out,
only one company has the patent.

32:55.256 --> 32:58.555
Sorry for the delay.
Ms. Sharp will be right with you.

33:01.629 --> 33:04.962
I have reservations about
asking Massive Dynamic for a favor.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.292
The corporate mind
always looks for quid pro quo.

33:10.772 --> 33:12.797
Can I ask you a question?

33:13.207 --> 33:14.765
Of course.

33:15.943 --> 33:20.505
Before he died, Agent Scott suggested
that this was more than a coincidence...

33:20.682 --> 33:23.116
...that you recruited me
for this assignment.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.683
Agent Dunham...

33:28.089 --> 33:32.253
...do you mind if I ask you a personal
question about you and Agent Scott?

33:38.232 --> 33:42.032
The very last time you were intimate...

33:45.239 --> 33:46.297
...were you safe?

33:50.344 --> 33:52.175
You weren't, were you?

34:00.955 --> 34:02.820
Agent Dunham?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.387
Ms. Sharp will see you now.

34:07.995 --> 34:10.020
I hope the ride was comfortable.

34:10.498 --> 34:12.795
I'm not a big fan of airplanes myself.

34:12.967 --> 34:16.266
I mean, despite the obvious intellectual
understanding of their safety.

34:16.437 --> 34:18.803
My hand still get sweaty on takeoff.

34:19.407 --> 34:21.534
Thank you again for your cooperation.
We're very...

34:21.708 --> 34:24.473
No need to thank me.
You know, I've been thinking of you.

34:24.645 --> 34:27.045
Meaning to thank you
for being a woman of your word...

34:27.215 --> 34:30.184
...and keeping Massive Dynamic
out of the press.

34:30.685 --> 34:33.176
I also wanted to say...

34:33.353 --> 34:36.687
...you have my sincere condolences
on the loss of Agent Scott.

34:38.559 --> 34:40.322
And what do you know
about Agent Scott?

34:41.228 --> 34:44.164
I know that he was your partner.

34:45.233 --> 34:48.498
I've lost people close to me.
I know how hard that can be.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.795
Not to mention the rumor
about what he was involved with.

34:52.974 --> 34:57.070
And, of course, the joy of being a female
in a traditionally male line of work.

34:57.245 --> 34:59.110
I mean, no doubt
some of your male colleagues...

34:59.280 --> 35:02.716
...are assuming that you two
were intimate.

35:05.653 --> 35:07.086
Ah.

35:13.261 --> 35:15.889
The electronic-pulse camera.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.863
Travel safely, Agent Dunham.

35:39.821 --> 35:41.288
We ready?

35:41.455 --> 35:43.320
Dear, the lights.

35:45.059 --> 35:49.758
Goggles, all of you.
Do not look directly into the light.

35:49.931 --> 35:52.365
And we're really
gonna be able to see her last image?

35:52.533 --> 35:55.696
Faith. Never a bad thing to have.

37:00.101 --> 37:02.797
This is taking too long.
If he's picked up another victim...

37:02.970 --> 37:04.801
Impatient. You always were.

37:04.972 --> 37:07.668
As if you ever knew me well enough
to make a statement like that.

37:08.042 --> 37:11.637
Ha. You're a smart boy,
but there is much you don't know.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.906
- Did you see that?
- What was that?

37:16.651 --> 37:18.016
Wait, wait. What was that?

37:19.453 --> 37:22.581
- Can you focus?
- It's not a slide projector.

37:23.724 --> 37:26.352
- Wait. Astrid, can you flip it over?
- Yes.

37:30.598 --> 37:32.463
That's a bridge.

37:33.234 --> 37:35.327
I know that bridge.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.403
I used to live in Dighton. That's, um...

37:37.571 --> 37:39.869
That's Sargent Bridge.
That's in Stoughton.

37:40.041 --> 37:42.771
- What's in Stoughton?
- A warehouse district.

37:42.944 --> 37:45.435
This would be
one of the last images she saw?

37:45.613 --> 37:46.773
In theory, yes.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.945
Where would she have to have been
to see that angle of the bridge?

37:50.117 --> 37:52.779
Pull up NRO online,
image-mapping database.

37:57.591 --> 37:58.785
Okay, match the angles.

38:01.896 --> 38:02.920
Wait, stop.

38:03.965 --> 38:07.298
That's it. Pull out to aerial view
and triangulate.

38:09.136 --> 38:11.297
It looks like
she's in this warehouse district.

38:11.472 --> 38:13.997
The 1600 block of Bond Street.

38:14.175 --> 38:18.578
I want satellite images of that area
for the last 24 hours.

38:21.582 --> 38:25.416
Street sweeper on the access road
at 8:05 p.m.

38:25.586 --> 38:28.111
I got nothing between 6 and 7:45 p.m.

38:28.289 --> 38:30.314
What are we looking for, exactly?

38:30.491 --> 38:32.118
She died in one of these buildings.

38:32.293 --> 38:37.788
I've got a gray sedan
parked outside Unit 17 at 8:05 a.m.

38:37.999 --> 38:39.990
I've got the same vehicle
eight hours later.

38:40.167 --> 38:42.260
That's the estimated time of death
of our last victim.

38:42.436 --> 38:44.301
If you get anything more specific,
call me.

38:44.472 --> 38:46.167
You got it.

38:47.975 --> 38:52.105
It worked, Peter. Hear that? Worked.

38:58.686 --> 39:02.315
- So Lessing, Borrow, Belmont...
- Hold on.

39:02.490 --> 39:04.856
Did you say Borrow?
Did we pass Borrow already?

39:06.894 --> 39:08.486
There.

39:22.743 --> 39:25.644
- Stay there.
- That's just not gonna happen.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.141
FBI. Put your hands up.

39:58.579 --> 40:00.911
I said, put your hands up.

40:02.049 --> 40:03.073
She's alive.

40:04.185 --> 40:05.550
Is there anyone else here?

40:08.055 --> 40:09.682
- You have your phone?
- Yeah.

40:09.857 --> 40:13.486
Dial 17224, ask for Charlie Francis.

40:13.661 --> 40:17.495
Tell him we need field assist.
Tell him to ping the GPS for the location.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.860
Safety's on the right.
Do not let him move.

40:26.407 --> 40:27.601
Freeze!

40:38.018 --> 40:39.747
Hey, hey! Back off.

40:46.560 --> 40:50.052
Hello? It's Peter.

40:51.966 --> 40:53.399
Just making popcorn.

40:53.567 --> 40:55.091
I'm with a woman in her mid-20s.

40:55.269 --> 40:58.397
She is going into cardiac arrest
due to an overdose of anesthesia.

40:59.907 --> 41:02.239
- Her heart just stopped.
- Do you have any cocaine?

41:02.409 --> 41:05.071
Cocaine? No, I don't have any cocaine.

41:05.246 --> 41:08.272
Oh, that's too bad.
You'll have to shock her heart.

41:08.449 --> 41:10.041
Yeah, I know that.

41:10.217 --> 41:12.447
Unfortunately, I don't have a defibrillator.

41:29.003 --> 41:30.766
- Hey, you still there?
- Mm.

41:30.938 --> 41:34.339
What is the optimal voltage
for cardiac resuscitation?

41:34.508 --> 41:36.237
Try 200 volts.

41:56.130 --> 41:57.757
All right, here goes.

42:03.871 --> 42:06.101
- It's not working.
- Well, you'll have to crank it.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.078
Hey, it worked.

42:15.249 --> 42:16.807
Good work, son. Good work.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.013
Hey. Ha, ha.

42:22.189 --> 42:23.520
You're gonna be okay.

43:03.631 --> 43:04.655
He...

43:04.832 --> 43:07.164
He should have let me die...

43:07.334 --> 43:09.632
...a long time ago.

43:11.372 --> 43:13.101
I was...

43:16.176 --> 43:18.770
I was an experiment.

43:19.947 --> 43:21.471
Someone...

43:21.649 --> 43:24.015
Someone paid him.

43:24.184 --> 43:27.381
The man I call my father.

43:27.755 --> 43:30.815
He should have let me die.

43:31.091 --> 43:33.559
That was his mistake.

43:33.961 --> 43:38.261
But he was blinded because he loved me.

43:39.433 --> 43:43.699
He loved me.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.602
He...

44:05.125 --> 44:06.615
Thank you again for your help.

44:06.827 --> 44:09.227
That's what I'm here for.
I hope it served you well.

44:10.497 --> 44:12.226
I'd ask you
what you wanted the camera for...

44:12.399 --> 44:14.424
...but I respect your confidentiality.

44:14.935 --> 44:16.596
Well, we're grateful for your help.

44:16.770 --> 44:19.398
Seems you're settling well
into your new position.

44:19.873 --> 44:22.501
- Excuse me?
- I don't think a woman of your talents...

44:22.676 --> 44:24.075
...should be in public service.

44:24.244 --> 44:25.506
Oh?

44:25.679 --> 44:26.703
And where should I be?

44:27.214 --> 44:29.944
- Here. At Massive Dynamic.
- You're offering me a job?

44:30.117 --> 44:33.416
Phillip Broyles is a good man
and his record speaks for itself.

44:33.587 --> 44:36.988
I'm sure you got into law enforcement
because you wanted to make a difference.

44:37.424 --> 44:39.153
So consider this:

44:39.326 --> 44:43.786
Massive Dynamic is one of the 10 largest
economic entities in the world.

44:43.964 --> 44:47.627
Our weapons technologies shape
the Defense Department's strategies.

44:47.801 --> 44:51.635
Our investments sway the markets
and make or break presidential elections.

44:51.805 --> 44:54.137
Overseas, we have responsibilities...

44:54.308 --> 44:57.038
...traditionally sacred to the state:

44:57.211 --> 44:59.179
The right to direct private armies.

44:59.346 --> 45:01.712
To manage global affairs
into stable equilibrium.

45:01.882 --> 45:04.942
- You're serious.
- Yes, I am.

45:06.286 --> 45:10.689
Not to mention I believe a position here
would speed your effort to find answers.

45:11.191 --> 45:14.922
- You're referring to the Pattern?
- Among other things.

45:21.235 --> 45:22.361
Penrose took a hit.

45:24.304 --> 45:25.999
Forensics tracked a 2-mile spatter trail...

45:26.173 --> 45:27.902
...leading from the warehouse
out to Route 1.

45:28.642 --> 45:31.907
Local P.D. is on the lookout and I've ordered
checkpoints along the interstates.

45:32.079 --> 45:34.707
But nothing so far. He's still out there.

45:35.549 --> 45:36.573
Listen.

45:39.052 --> 45:42.783
Every aspect of these investigations
is strictly classified.

45:42.956 --> 45:44.150
All of it.

45:44.324 --> 45:46.792
- You understand that?
- Of course.

45:46.960 --> 45:50.418
Certain private individuals have been
granted clearance regarding the Pattern.

45:50.597 --> 45:53.896
Including Nina Sharp.
But that clearance is limited.

45:54.067 --> 45:57.525
I understand. Sure. But...

45:57.771 --> 45:59.932
I'm not clear on what you're getting at.

46:00.107 --> 46:02.769
When you were with her,
did she share anything with you?

46:02.943 --> 46:05.935
Did she mention the Pattern?
Did she comment or ask you anything...

46:06.113 --> 46:08.673
...about the details of your investigation?

46:08.849 --> 46:10.282
Yeah, she did.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.247
She said you were a good man.

46:16.323 --> 46:18.086
And that was it?

46:22.563 --> 46:24.087
She offered me a job.

46:25.632 --> 46:27.122
And what did you say to that?

46:30.804 --> 46:33.796
I told her you were gonna
give me a raise.

46:36.543 --> 46:38.943
"I acknowledge
that by signing this document...

46:39.112 --> 46:43.276
...I waive my constitutional right
against unreasonable search and seizure."

46:43.450 --> 46:45.577
- I'm not signing this.
- I, however, will.

46:45.752 --> 46:47.947
Well, of course you will.
What have you got to lose?

46:48.121 --> 46:50.351
You're already committed
to a mental institution.

46:50.524 --> 46:51.616
You have to sign it too.

46:51.792 --> 46:54.022
I'm not signing my rights away
to the federal government.

46:54.194 --> 46:55.957
I already got enough trouble in my life.

46:58.332 --> 46:59.924
Peter told me...

47:00.100 --> 47:02.660
...about my former colleague and his son.

47:04.004 --> 47:07.269
It's one of the inherent pitfalls
of being a scientist.

47:08.075 --> 47:11.909
Trying to maintain that distinction...

47:13.113 --> 47:16.276
...between God's domain and our own.

47:19.486 --> 47:21.852
Sometimes I forget myself.

47:22.389 --> 47:24.414
But then, you already know that.

47:28.629 --> 47:30.529
What do you mean?

47:32.432 --> 47:34.400
If you've read my file...

47:34.568 --> 47:36.263
...then you know the truth...

47:36.436 --> 47:38.961
...about Peter's medical history.

47:40.173 --> 47:43.904
- I've been meaning to ask you...
- Walter.

47:44.912 --> 47:48.245
There was no mention
of any medical history.

47:48.415 --> 47:50.110
Just his birthday.

47:51.451 --> 47:52.475
Oh.

47:55.756 --> 48:00.022
Okay, I was going to ask you
to keep it between just the two of us...

48:00.193 --> 48:02.559
...but I suppose, then, there's no need.

48:09.102 --> 48:13.232
Zero. One. One.

48:13.407 --> 48:18.071
Two. Three. Eight.

48:18.245 --> 48:23.273
Thirteen. Twenty-one. Thirty-four.

48:23.450 --> 48:25.941
- Fifty-five.
- Hey!

48:26.119 --> 48:27.814
Walter.

48:28.255 --> 48:30.246
You're awake, Peter?

48:30.924 --> 48:31.948
Me too.

48:32.893 --> 48:36.590
I was trying to lull myself to sleep.

48:36.930 --> 48:40.730
Yeah, I'm... I'm aware of that.

48:40.901 --> 48:43.062
I can hear you.

48:43.236 --> 48:46.103
- You think you could do that in your head?
- Wasn't I?

48:47.708 --> 48:50.302
I thought I was. Sorry.

48:50.477 --> 48:54.811
That's okay.
Just try and keep it down, all right?
