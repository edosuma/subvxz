00:05.130 --> 00:06.750
My name is Bridget.

00:06.790 --> 00:08.340
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.380 --> 00:10.960
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw,

00:11.010 --> 00:12.920
and we'll
protect you.
<b></b>
You don't get it.

00:12.970 --> 00:16.220
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:16.260 --> 00:18.510
I ran to my sister,
Siobhan, for help.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.020
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:21.060 --> 00:22.020
It was so easy.

00:22.060 --> 00:23.390
I saw a way out,

00:23.440 --> 00:26.480
and I took it.
They all think that I'm her.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.730
I had just found out
that I was pregnant...

00:28.770 --> 00:30.280
with our baby.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.280
Then let's expose Bridget
and get your life back.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.900
SIOBHAN: Bridget's getting
too close to the truth.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.700
I'm gonna have to
go back to Paris.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.780
This whole thing was your idea:

00:37.820 --> 00:40.370
the fake assault, the lawsuit.

00:40.410 --> 00:42.290
Point to the douchebag when
they ask you who did it.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.960
I still can't believe
we pulled this off.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.040
Who wants to toast
to being millionaires?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.460
JULIET:
And now it's falling apart.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.840
CARPENTER:
Her share of the money is gone?

00:48.880 --> 00:50.800
Tell me everything you know,
Juliet, right now.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.010
You have to help me.

00:54.420 --> 00:55.510
It's all right, sweetie.

01:08.860 --> 01:13.030
Madame Farrell,
have you been feeling
a lot of movement?

01:13.070 --> 01:15.570
Yeah. It's hard to believe
a baby can kick that much.

01:15.610 --> 01:17.660
Mm. Well, your
physical was good.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.780
HcG levels a bit high.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.910
Is that something
I should be concerned about?

01:22.950 --> 01:24.830
Not necessarily.
Tell me,

01:24.870 --> 01:27.920
who was
your previous OB-GYN?

01:27.960 --> 01:30.040
Uh, Dr. Roux. In the 16th.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.420
I didn't care for him,
so I came to you.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.800
And your first
ultrasound was

01:33.840 --> 01:35.340
at 5 weeks?

01:35.380 --> 01:36.720
Yes, that's correct.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.260
It appears Dr. Roux
wasn't very thorough.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.300
He should've
caught this,

01:41.350 --> 01:42.970
even at 5 weeks.

01:43.010 --> 01:43.970
Caught what?

01:46.100 --> 01:47.230
You're having twins.

01:58.450 --> 02:01.450
And on and on.
I mean, come on.

02:01.490 --> 02:03.160
Greer and Jeff spend
one weekend in Napa,

02:03.200 --> 02:04.410
and all of a sudden,
everything's about

02:04.450 --> 02:06.910
the "subtle oakiness"
of the cabernet?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.290
I think they're getting
a little bit "oaky."

02:08.330 --> 02:10.380
They're just being
enthusiastic.

02:10.420 --> 02:14.210
I get enthusiasm,
just not about wine.

02:14.250 --> 02:17.630
Oh, yeah?
About what?

02:17.670 --> 02:19.180
Other things.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.180
[woman screaming in distance]

02:23.850 --> 02:25.810
[screaming]

02:32.020 --> 02:33.690
"Summer Camp Slasher."

02:33.730 --> 02:35.440
This is my favorite!

02:35.480 --> 02:37.360
So I've recently learned.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.780
The surprises just keep coming
with you, don't they?

02:42.950 --> 02:44.330
What is all this?

02:44.370 --> 02:45.830
Well, we've been putting off
so many things

02:45.870 --> 02:47.120
because of the
recent insanity.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.200
I thought we could
at least have

02:48.250 --> 02:51.080
that movie night
we talked about.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.670
Are you sure you're OK
with the movie?

02:52.710 --> 02:54.130
It's not exactly
my cup of tea,

02:54.170 --> 02:57.090
but it beats
another viewing
of "The Notebook."

02:57.130 --> 02:58.130
Want some candy?

02:58.170 --> 02:59.550
Yes, please.

02:59.590 --> 03:00.840
Oh, you're gonna
love this.

03:00.880 --> 03:01.840
This is genius.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.600
[screaming]

03:10.350 --> 03:11.480
This isn't candy.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.020
A couple of months ago,

03:13.060 --> 03:18.320
you said it was one of your
most...romantic memories.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.940
Seventh grade,

03:19.990 --> 03:22.910
you and Timmy McPenkow sneaking
into a midnight screening

03:22.950 --> 03:25.450
of "Summer Camp Slasher."

03:25.490 --> 03:26.830
And he gave you...

03:26.870 --> 03:29.500
A candy ring.
[chuckles]

03:29.540 --> 03:31.750
It's getting harder
to find ways to impress you,

03:31.790 --> 03:35.500
so I thought I'd recycle one
from your past.

03:35.540 --> 03:39.670
I have a confession to make.

03:39.710 --> 03:40.720
That wasn't me.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.180
It was my sister's story;
I know it's stupid.

03:45.220 --> 03:49.560
I just...I was so envious,
I pretended it was me.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.350
Well...it's you now.

03:56.900 --> 04:00.070
You don't have
to pretend anymore.

04:00.110 --> 04:03.200
You know, I've been working up
to this for a long time.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.200
If circumstances hadn't
conspired against me,

04:05.240 --> 04:06.370
I'd have done this
months ago.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.040
Siobhan...

04:13.160 --> 04:14.040
will you marry me?

04:17.960 --> 04:20.550
Again?

04:20.590 --> 04:21.550
Yes.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.350
Oh, Doctor, excuse me.

04:31.390 --> 04:32.520
There seems to be a mistake.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.690
These dates are off
by a few weeks.

04:34.730 --> 04:36.440
I conceived in mid-August.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.980
I can assure you our estimate is
accurate to within a day or two.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.610
[quietly]:
How am I gonna tell him?

04:46.660 --> 04:47.620
Tell who?

04:50.910 --> 04:52.750
Pardon me if this is
too forward,

04:52.790 --> 04:55.870
but are you worried your husband
is not the father?

04:57.500 --> 04:58.840
I'm worried he is.

05:15.180 --> 05:18.100
You guys do get that
you're already married, right?

05:18.150 --> 05:21.860
[both chuckle]

05:21.900 --> 05:24.780
Well, what do you think?

05:24.820 --> 05:25.780
I think...

05:28.200 --> 05:29.660
...old people are weird.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.870
But you're also really cute.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.500
So you just wanted to know
that I'm cool with it?

05:39.540 --> 05:40.790
Well, that and...

05:40.840 --> 05:42.300
Actually, we were hoping

05:42.340 --> 05:44.460
that you would be part
of the wedding.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.600
I don't know what to say.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.970
Your first wedding...

05:52.010 --> 05:54.930
I wanted you there;
we both did.

05:54.970 --> 05:55.930
It was very
complicated.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.270
Your mother...
Dad,

05:57.310 --> 05:58.310
it's OK.

06:01.770 --> 06:04.070
So, like, a bridesmaid?

06:04.110 --> 06:07.490
Actually, I was thinking
more like maid of honor?

06:09.660 --> 06:11.120
[phone rings]

06:11.160 --> 06:12.120
Sorry.

06:15.540 --> 06:18.870
Uh, sure. I should take this.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.920
We had her attention
for about a minute.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.500
but I'd say
that went well.

06:26.170 --> 06:28.130
[both chuckle]

06:30.680 --> 06:31.890
What is it?

06:31.930 --> 06:33.430
We need to talk

06:33.470 --> 06:34.760
about Tessa's accident.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.060
You call that an "accident?"

06:36.100 --> 06:37.230
Look, you believe
what you want, Juliet,

06:37.270 --> 06:38.480
but I just got paid

06:38.520 --> 06:40.690
a not-so-friendly visit
by the NYPD, OK?

06:40.730 --> 06:42.980
It seems I'm a suspect
in Tessa's beating.

06:43.020 --> 06:44.480
She accused me
of sexual assault,

06:44.520 --> 06:46.400
so in their eyes,
I have motive.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.990
If I find out you had anything
to do with tipping them off...

06:49.030 --> 06:52.030
or if you even think about
accusing me in the future...

06:52.070 --> 06:53.950
you'll be sorry.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.240
[line disconnects]

06:55.280 --> 06:56.620
[typing]

06:56.660 --> 06:59.250
It's just your
word-processing software.

06:59.290 --> 07:00.540
Easy fix.

07:00.580 --> 07:03.080
I should go back
to typewriters.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.460
All I need to get you
up and running

07:04.500 --> 07:06.250
is the activation code.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.710
You keep
the original packaging?

07:07.760 --> 07:10.170
Mm, yeah. It's upstairs.
I'll go get it.

07:38.580 --> 07:40.290
Siobhan's office.

07:40.330 --> 07:41.330
[door shuts]

07:49.710 --> 07:51.380
I couldn't find the key,

07:51.420 --> 07:54.090
but Henry paid to have your
sister's office cleared out.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.470
He what?

07:55.510 --> 07:58.510
I found the receipt
for the movers in his bag.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.140
Henry cleaned out the office

08:01.180 --> 08:03.900
where some mystery woman
was spying on me.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.810
All of which
is probably connected

08:05.860 --> 08:07.860
to the attempt
on Siobhan's life?

08:07.900 --> 08:10.740
And now a threat to yours.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.860
WOMAN: Mrs. Martin?
You all set in there?

08:12.900 --> 08:14.950
Um, just a second.

08:14.990 --> 08:15.950
Where are you?

08:18.330 --> 08:20.450
Running an errand.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.000
Malcolm, I realize
that this is major.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.710
I'm just right in
the middle of something.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.500
So I'm gonna call you back
in, like, 10 minutes. OK, bye.

08:33.010 --> 08:35.180
It's absolutely
stunning.

08:35.220 --> 08:36.300
Even more beautiful

08:36.340 --> 08:38.680
than the last one,
if I do say so.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.060
Helps that you don't
look a day older

08:40.100 --> 08:42.680
than when I fitted you
for your first wedding.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.890
You said you wanted
to change it up,

08:43.940 --> 08:47.310
but Reem Acra is a classic.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.570
Surely white roses are
still your favorite?

08:50.610 --> 08:52.400
And I know you said
"hair down,"

08:52.440 --> 08:56.030
but don't you think
for this dress...

08:56.070 --> 08:58.820
your signature style
works best?

08:58.870 --> 08:59.830
Like I said,

08:59.870 --> 09:02.080
you look exactly
the same.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.710
No.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.210
What's the matter?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.880
This isn't the dress.
I'm sorry.

09:11.920 --> 09:12.960
OK.

09:15.510 --> 09:18.760
I'm not the same woman who
married Andrew 6 years ago.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.100
If I'm gonna marry him again,
he has to know that.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.230
Well, I'm very happy
for the two of you.

09:29.270 --> 09:31.610
That was almost
convincing.

09:31.650 --> 09:36.200
We both know Siobhan and I
haven't always gotten along.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.360
But I have to admit,
at least recently,

09:38.410 --> 09:41.280
she seems to have
made you very happy.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.790
Congratulations.

09:42.830 --> 09:43.910
Thank you.

[text alert tone plays]

CLAUDINE: Whatcha doing?

10:01.930 --> 10:03.430
Just updating
some drivers

10:03.470 --> 10:06.020
on Ms. Charles' computer.

10:06.060 --> 10:07.020
Did you hear about the wedding?

10:09.440 --> 10:11.060
What wedding?

10:11.110 --> 10:13.440
Andrew and Siobhan's.
They're renewing their vows.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.690
Claudine, if we paid you

10:14.730 --> 10:16.360
to gossip, you'd
be a millionaire.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.700
What are you doing
at my computer?

10:21.740 --> 10:22.830
Just routine maintenance.

10:26.790 --> 10:27.790
All done.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.430
[typing]

10:42.470 --> 10:44.560
What are you up to,
Malcolm Ward?

10:46.930 --> 10:48.640
[knocking]

10:52.520 --> 10:54.520
[sighs]

10:54.570 --> 10:57.030
Why did you clean out
my office?

10:57.070 --> 11:00.070
I went by the other day
and all my stuff was gone.

11:00.110 --> 11:02.950
No notice. No idea
where my stuff went.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.870
It's my office.
I have a right to know.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.410
It's not your office.

11:10.540 --> 11:14.420
It's our office, Siobhan.
You remember?

11:16.210 --> 11:18.460
I mean, it was mine
long before I lent it to you.

11:18.510 --> 11:19.510
We shared it.

11:19.550 --> 11:20.510
Of course.

11:20.550 --> 11:22.220
But it didn't really seem

11:22.260 --> 11:27.140
fair for me to be paying rent
on a office that only you used,

11:27.180 --> 11:28.810
especially after we split.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.480
OK.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.320
But I'm also missing
a key and a keychain.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.690
Mm.

11:37.730 --> 11:38.900
You mean...

11:38.940 --> 11:39.940
...like this?

11:43.660 --> 11:46.910
You...you remember this day.

11:46.950 --> 11:50.160
You took me to that store
to have these made.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.040
Matching key chains,
because you were always

11:52.080 --> 11:53.920
so sentimental.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.750
And eager to blow
Andrew's money.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.550
Now, I...

11:58.590 --> 12:02.930
I still have mine, so it's not
my problem if you lost yours.

12:02.970 --> 12:04.050
Fine.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.640
But I want my stuff.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.680
Your stuff is in storage.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.770
Getting it back to you?

12:09.810 --> 12:11.730
It's not really my priority.

12:16.810 --> 12:18.320
CATHERINE:
I know that you're upset, angel,

12:18.360 --> 12:21.610
but that is perfectly good
arugula you're wasting.

12:21.650 --> 12:23.780
I'm just scared.

12:23.820 --> 12:25.530
Tessa was attacked

12:25.570 --> 12:28.950
right after I told Mr. Carpenter
that she was becoming a problem.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.580
And I think he did it,

12:30.620 --> 12:32.540
Mom, and now
he's calling me,

12:32.580 --> 12:34.790
and he's
threatening me...

12:34.830 --> 12:36.130
Listen, Juliet.

12:36.170 --> 12:37.460
This Carpenter guy?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.170
He's just a pawn.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.880
I had you use him to get
our plan off the ground.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.090
And it worked:
you have your trust fund back.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.340
Yeah.

12:44.380 --> 12:46.640
Except for the part
that Carpenter has,

12:46.680 --> 12:49.390
and the other part that
he just stole from Tessa.

12:49.430 --> 12:50.930
Mom...

12:50.970 --> 12:52.730
if you had seen her face...

12:56.060 --> 12:57.650
Was it really worth it?

12:59.570 --> 13:02.530
Not to mention everything
that I put Daddy through...

13:02.570 --> 13:03.780
[sighs]

13:03.820 --> 13:06.450
You know, if things
are so bad here...

13:06.490 --> 13:08.200
why don't we just go?

13:08.240 --> 13:10.870
Pick a place on the map.
Any place.

13:10.910 --> 13:12.830
OK? We'll take the money,
we'll leave,

13:12.870 --> 13:15.370
and you won't have to worry
about any of this, ever again.

13:15.410 --> 13:17.170
I can't just leave.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.920
Why not? We have enough money.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.710
It's just not a good time.

13:20.750 --> 13:24.550
Siobhan and Dad are doing
like this vow renewal thing.

13:24.590 --> 13:26.430
They're what?

13:26.470 --> 13:28.050
It's like a remarriage?

13:28.090 --> 13:30.510
It's totally cheeseball,
I know.

13:30.550 --> 13:31.890
It's just
Siobhan asked me

13:31.930 --> 13:33.850
to be the maid of honor
and I said yes.

13:35.980 --> 13:36.940
Are you mad?

13:40.560 --> 13:41.520
Why would I be?

13:42.940 --> 13:44.190
But if we are
staying in town,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.740
this Carpenter guy
has to be dealt with.

13:46.780 --> 13:49.070
I'm gonna talk to him,
and get him to back off.

13:49.110 --> 13:50.950
No, Mom...
Don't worry.

13:50.990 --> 13:53.990
I know you wanted to keep my
involvement a secret from him.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.250
I will be discreet.

13:55.290 --> 13:56.750
No. It's not that.

13:58.330 --> 14:01.380
He's dangerous.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.590
I can take care of myself.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.180
[knocking on door]

14:16.140 --> 14:18.440
Hey, you've got some nerve
calling Juliet, huh?

14:18.480 --> 14:20.730
Intimidating her?
Threatening her?

14:20.770 --> 14:24.020
Well, hear this: you are gonna
stop harassing my daughter...

14:25.400 --> 14:27.700
And start harassing me.

14:32.410 --> 14:34.540
Bridget.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.000
Malcolm?

14:37.040 --> 14:39.580
Housekeeper let me up.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.580
What is it?

14:41.630 --> 14:44.250
You can't marry Andrew.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.090
[sighs]

14:46.130 --> 14:48.090
I was going to tell you.

14:48.130 --> 14:50.340
I just...

14:50.380 --> 14:51.890
I knew what you would say.

14:51.930 --> 14:53.720
And you're right.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.220
But Malcolm, I love him
and I want to marry him.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.890
I just have to find the way
to tell him the truth.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.140
And I will...

14:59.180 --> 15:02.690
Bridget, you can't
marry Andrew...

15:02.730 --> 15:04.320
...because he's a crook.

15:11.570 --> 15:12.660
What? Excuse me?

15:12.700 --> 15:13.660
Remember how I told you

15:13.700 --> 15:15.240
I was staying
in New York

15:15.280 --> 15:18.370
'cause Andrew's offer
was too good to refuse?

15:18.410 --> 15:19.370
Yeah?

15:19.410 --> 15:20.920
I lied.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.710
I stayed because I knew
there was something shady

15:22.750 --> 15:23.920
going on in his company.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.460
What are you talking about?

15:25.500 --> 15:28.010
I talked to one of Andrew's
prospective investors.

15:28.050 --> 15:30.260
Martin/Charles is probably
just in a winning streak.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.590
It happens.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.760
But winning streaks
don't last forever.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.550
When they go on
too long, well...

15:35.600 --> 15:37.100
that's when
you gotta wonder.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.720
He took one look at the
fund's growth projections

15:38.770 --> 15:40.940
and said they were
"too good to be true."

15:40.980 --> 15:43.560
You talked to one person.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.980
What about Henry?

15:45.020 --> 15:47.110
He pulled his money
from the fund in a hurry.

15:47.150 --> 15:48.530
He called Andrew
a crook to his face.

15:48.570 --> 15:50.150
Wait, now you're
taking Henry's word?

15:50.190 --> 15:51.740
He knows something we don't.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.200
Closing my account had nothing
to do with Martin/Charles.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.620
In fact, if I had
any doubts,

15:56.660 --> 15:57.910
would I have just
had my father-in-law

15:57.950 --> 16:00.750
invest in that fund?

16:00.790 --> 16:02.620
Even today, he was
trying to downplay it.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.630
Claimed that if he knew
there was something screwy

16:04.670 --> 16:06.670
going on there, why would
he let his father-in-law

16:06.710 --> 16:08.210
invest in the fund?
But I don't believe him.

16:08.250 --> 16:11.170
Gemma's father
invested in Martin/Charles?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.340
Yeah. Why?

16:15.260 --> 16:18.180
It's not a big deal.
I just...

16:18.220 --> 16:20.470
thought Andrew had
backed off that.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.430
I saw something on
Olivia's computer today.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.150
I think it might have
something to do with all this.

16:25.190 --> 16:26.860
Based on what?

16:26.900 --> 16:29.110
It's a hunch, Bridget.

16:29.150 --> 16:32.280
So you don't have proof
of any kind.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.030
And you pick today,
after Andrew proposes,

16:35.070 --> 16:38.240
to come to me with these
baseless accusations? What...?

16:38.280 --> 16:40.740
After all that Andrew's
done for you, really?

16:40.790 --> 16:42.830
"After all
he's done for me"?

16:42.870 --> 16:44.580
He gave me a job, Bridget.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.880
A job I'm more
than qualified for.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.500
So what is it?
He hasn't done enough?

16:49.550 --> 16:51.670
I'm not Andrew's
charity case.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.170
You keep acting
like I'm lucky

16:53.220 --> 16:54.760
you're letting me
stick around.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.010
But haven't you noticed

16:56.050 --> 16:58.850
the only reason
I'm here is for you?

16:58.890 --> 17:01.060
I didn't mean it like that,
Malcolm, it...

17:01.100 --> 17:04.060
Wait...come on,
please don't go like this!

17:04.100 --> 17:05.480
[sighs]

17:05.520 --> 17:06.980
HENRY: Yeah, she didn't know
what to believe,

17:07.020 --> 17:09.190
which I played
to our advantage.

17:09.230 --> 17:12.070
Quite skillfully,
if I may say so myself.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.110
I'm glad you're enjoying this.

17:15.150 --> 17:16.820
Hey. I'm just
paying her back

17:16.860 --> 17:19.580
for everything
she put me through.

17:19.620 --> 17:21.080
And Malcolm?

17:21.120 --> 17:23.950
Malcolm is definitely fishing
at Martin/Charles.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.540
But, as far as I can tell,

17:25.580 --> 17:28.880
Bridget is in the dark about
what is going on over there.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.420
Did she find my box of
Martin/Charles paperwork?

17:30.460 --> 17:32.090
I doubt it.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.840
If she'd found those papers,
she would have taken them.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.630
And you still have them?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.640
Yeah. I got the box right here.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.970
Good. Hold on to them.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.560
How was the doctor's?

17:46.310 --> 17:49.610
Uh...overwhelming.

17:49.650 --> 17:50.770
You gotta give me
more than that.

17:50.810 --> 17:53.030
I want to talk
about our baby, Shiv.

17:56.150 --> 17:58.410
Henry...

17:58.450 --> 18:01.030
it's not our baby.

18:04.330 --> 18:07.580
It's...babies.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.330
Wait. You mean...

18:09.370 --> 18:10.330
It's twins.

18:13.130 --> 18:14.510
W...Wow.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.880
Twins!

18:18.930 --> 18:21.350
Again! I'm...I'm two-for-two!

18:21.390 --> 18:23.350
[Henry laughs]

18:31.270 --> 18:33.020
After everything that
I've done for her,

18:33.070 --> 18:37.360
she still chooses Andrew
and the Ice Princess over me.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.030
Little brat.

18:40.070 --> 18:41.910
But at least I have you now.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.290
But I meant what I said.

18:48.330 --> 18:50.710
Hey, you have to
back off Juliet.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.500
'Cause bothering her
is not part of the plan.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.250
Yeah. Well, she's still
got it in her head that

18:54.290 --> 18:57.090
I'm the one who attacked Tessa.

18:57.130 --> 18:58.670
I mean, it's unfortunate
Tessa was dumb enough

18:58.720 --> 19:00.130
to flash her money
around East Harlem,

19:00.180 --> 19:03.050
begging to get robbed,
but it's not my fault.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.060
I just don't want Juliet
messing things up for us.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.100
Oh, trust me.

19:10.140 --> 19:13.190
If I tell Juliet
to keep quiet...

19:13.230 --> 19:15.900
Juliet will keep quiet.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.240
Hey.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.490
How was the fitting?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.250
It was good.

19:28.290 --> 19:30.330
I think I'm going to
keep looking, though.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.620
That's fine by me.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.540
As long as everything
is perfect for you.

19:33.580 --> 19:35.840
Now, not to kill
the mood with logistics,

19:35.880 --> 19:37.420
but we should firm up a date.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.630
Have you had a chance
to look at your calendar yet?

19:39.670 --> 19:41.470
Not yet.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.590
How was work?

19:43.640 --> 19:46.140
Fine. Normal.

19:46.180 --> 19:48.600
Olivia still pressuring you
to land Arbogast?

19:51.480 --> 19:54.730
We did land Arbogast.

19:54.770 --> 19:57.440
I know how you felt about it,
so I backed off--

19:57.480 --> 19:59.320
as I said I would--

19:59.360 --> 20:02.360
but Olivia somehow
worked her magic on him.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.490
How so?

20:04.530 --> 20:06.910
Olivia's always felt that
the rules don't apply to her.

20:06.950 --> 20:09.870
Part of the reason why
she's so good at her job.

20:09.910 --> 20:12.290
[sighs]

20:12.330 --> 20:15.170
Half the time I don't know how
she accomplishes what she does,

20:15.210 --> 20:17.500
and I probably don't
want to know, either.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.880
MALCOLM: Thanks.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.800
I screwed up installing
some drivers this morning,

20:24.840 --> 20:28.720
and I want to fix it
before Olivia notices.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.640
I promise, I'll be quick.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.390
Just don't forget
your other promise.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.600
Next week.

20:34.650 --> 20:35.600
Dinner and a movie.

20:38.980 --> 20:39.940
[door closes]

20:46.700 --> 20:48.660
[typing]

21:02.970 --> 21:04.420
OLIVIA:
Mr. Ward.

21:04.470 --> 21:05.470
Gentlemen.

21:07.590 --> 21:09.260
SECURITY GUARD:
Sir...

21:09.300 --> 21:10.350
You need to come with us.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.310
Fired right there,
on the spot.
<b></b>
For what?

21:19.360 --> 21:21.980
For stealing this.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.240
Guards that frisked me
didn't check my shoe.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.450
This graph is just a mock-up.

21:28.490 --> 21:30.160
I'm not using actual data.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.080
Look what happens when
I run it through this algorithm

21:32.120 --> 21:33.500
I stole off Olivia's computer.

21:36.290 --> 21:37.620
It's the same data.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.210
But the algorithm
manipulates the data

21:39.250 --> 21:41.250
to create the illusion
of market volatility.

21:43.920 --> 21:44.920
Confused?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.260
Impressed.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.430
You are good at this.

21:48.470 --> 21:49.680
Returns this stable?

21:49.720 --> 21:51.510
They're literally impossible.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.850
This algorithm's only function
is to hide phony data.

21:55.730 --> 21:57.140
So...this is the proof

21:57.190 --> 21:59.310
that there's something
fishy at the company.

21:59.350 --> 22:00.810
Not quite.

22:00.860 --> 22:02.400
That they have this
program strongly suggests

22:02.440 --> 22:04.570
they have phony data to hide.

22:04.610 --> 22:07.900
But I don't have the
actual data to prove it.

22:07.950 --> 22:10.370
And now that you're fired...

22:10.410 --> 22:11.830
[sighs]

22:11.870 --> 22:14.080
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you, Malcolm.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.580
When you first came to me
with your suspicions,

22:15.620 --> 22:19.290
it was...it was just
more than I could handle.

22:19.330 --> 22:21.170
But you were right.

22:21.210 --> 22:24.090
I mean, you've done nothing
but look out for me.

22:24.130 --> 22:25.380
If you say
there's something up,

22:25.420 --> 22:29.340
then there's definitely
something up.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.590
But I still don't think

22:30.640 --> 22:32.680
Andrew's the one behind it.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.180
It has to be Olivia.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.930
She's the one cutthroat enough
to land Arbogast,

22:35.970 --> 22:37.310
she's the one
that fired you...

22:37.350 --> 22:39.850
And she's the only one
using the algorithm.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.810
Before I broke into
Olivia's computer,

22:41.860 --> 22:43.860

We'll reach Nassau at 9:00,
then a charter to the Caymans,

24:53.780 --> 24:56.360
I was getting
your engagement ring sized,

so I went digging.

Andrew thought I was
being a bit harsh,

I caught him red-handed,

36:33.810 --> 36:35.150
The tears were a nice touch.

36:35.190 --> 36:36.440
TESSA: Well, it's easy to cry

36:36.480 --> 36:39.030
when there's this much
cash involved.

36:39.070 --> 36:41.610
To getting your
trust fund back, huh?

36:41.650 --> 36:42.610
Then let's celebrate.

36:42.650 --> 36:43.610
JULIET: Thanks.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.670
Hey. Let's go inside.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.050
OK, so when I went
to Pratt Street

37:05.090 --> 37:07.140
a few months ago,
it was abandoned.

37:07.180 --> 37:10.100
And I know Siobhan had her
suspicions about that place,

37:10.140 --> 37:12.850
but if she had those papers,
then she was getting close.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.480
Really close.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.730
At about the same time,
the accountants

37:15.770 --> 37:17.560
suddenly relocate
to Long Island?

37:17.610 --> 37:20.230
You're saying Olivia knew
Siobhan was onto her?

37:20.270 --> 37:22.780
It's a theory.

37:22.820 --> 37:25.910
What I'm about to say--
it's no theory.

37:25.950 --> 37:27.530
A fund the size
of Martin/Charles'

37:27.570 --> 37:29.490
using an accounting firm
that small?

37:29.530 --> 37:31.990
An accounting firm
in Hempstead of all places?

37:32.040 --> 37:33.700
There's no reason
to use such a small firm

37:33.750 --> 37:35.210
for such an important task...

37:35.250 --> 37:37.250
unless you're paying them
to clean the books

37:37.290 --> 37:40.090
and keep quiet about it.

37:40.130 --> 37:41.670
I've done
some research.

37:41.710 --> 37:43.880
Only one precedent
comes to mind.

37:43.920 --> 37:47.300
Big fund; tiny, shady
accountancy upstate.

37:47.340 --> 37:48.930
Bernie Madoff.

37:50.300 --> 37:53.060
Martin/Charles
is running a Ponzi scheme.

38:03.570 --> 38:05.280
What do you want?

38:05.320 --> 38:08.410
I just needed to
see my baby girl.

38:08.450 --> 38:09.410
I did what you said.

38:09.450 --> 38:11.030
I didn't tell.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.740
[sighs]
Thank you.

38:13.790 --> 38:15.000
Funny thing is,

38:15.040 --> 38:17.920
your little text
actually came in handy.

38:17.960 --> 38:18.920
How?

38:18.960 --> 38:20.380
Doesn't matter.

38:20.420 --> 38:22.630
What matters
is that you will never hear

38:22.670 --> 38:24.800
from that man ever again.

38:26.300 --> 38:27.630
What do you mean?

38:27.680 --> 38:29.390
Let's just say that he got
what he deserved

38:29.430 --> 38:32.890
for hurting Tessa.

38:32.930 --> 38:35.270
OK.

38:35.310 --> 38:36.640
What about Daddy?

38:36.680 --> 38:37.850
The money.

38:37.890 --> 38:39.100
Oh, angel,
he's the one who took

38:39.150 --> 38:41.110
your trust fund away
in the first place.

38:42.610 --> 38:43.940
You think
he's hurting?

38:43.980 --> 38:45.320
Pinching pennies
for this wedding?

38:45.360 --> 38:46.440
Like Siobhan
would allow that.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.200
Mom.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.950
The trust fund that your dad
said he was holding

38:49.990 --> 38:53.450
until your 25th birthday--
he still has it.

38:53.490 --> 38:54.700
So, if he really is
so hard up,

38:54.740 --> 38:56.370
he can always dip
into that.

38:57.410 --> 38:58.750
You get the settlement.

38:58.790 --> 39:00.580
He gets the trust fund.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.290
Everybody wins.

39:04.630 --> 39:05.590
Mm.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.180
From here on in,
everyone is going to be OK.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.730
So long as we
keep our secret a secret.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.810
Can you...keep our secret?

39:26.690 --> 39:28.360
That's my girl.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.330
[text alert tone plays]

39:56.600 --> 39:58.640
Andrew.

39:58.680 --> 39:59.640
We need to talk.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.730
I want to marry you...

40:04.770 --> 40:06.570
with all my heart.

40:08.400 --> 40:12.660
I just don't want it
to be like last time.

40:12.700 --> 40:17.160
I want it to be
like the first time.

40:17.200 --> 40:20.080
And to do that,
it can't be rushed.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.750
Can you understand?

40:26.630 --> 40:27.590
I can try.

40:32.260 --> 40:33.680
There's something else.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.310
[knocking]

40:47.360 --> 40:50.360
I paid you to rough the girl up,
not to beat her to a pulp.

40:56.950 --> 41:00.120
This is a lot to hear.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.500
You've worked
with Olivia forever,

41:01.540 --> 41:02.660
and to find out
that she's been

41:02.710 --> 41:06.170
betraying you
all this time...

41:06.210 --> 41:07.540
But I want you
to know that,

41:07.590 --> 41:09.000
however big
a mess this is,

41:09.040 --> 41:11.630
whatever it takes
to clean it up,

41:11.670 --> 41:13.760
I'll stand by you.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.590
We'll get
through this together.

41:19.970 --> 41:20.930
Siobhan.

41:25.270 --> 41:28.110
The Ponzi scheme
wasn't Olivia's idea.

41:31.820 --> 41:32.900
It was mine.
