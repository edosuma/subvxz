02:22.809 --> 02:24.893
You can't smoke here.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.187
What, even outside?

02:27.438 --> 02:29.648
Not even inside.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.069
Uh, well...
Pardon me, Mr. Ballinger.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.405
Or may I call you ...

02:36.823 --> 02:38.824
Maestro?

02:45.415 --> 02:49.543
- May I ask how your holiday is going?
- Very well, thank you.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.212
You've been coming here long?

02:53.590 --> 02:56.341
I've been coming here for about twenty years.

02:57.051 --> 03:00.846
I used to come with my wife
and now I keep coming on my own.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.849
Why... why Switzerland, Maestro?

03:03.975 --> 03:07.686
Well, it's close to Italy,
and after London and New York ...

03:07.729 --> 03:09.605
... I was director at the Venice orchestra.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.857
- Of course!
- For twenty-four years.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.859
Silly of me!

03:14.569 --> 03:16.945
And are you still directing
or composing, Maestro?

03:17.363 --> 03:19.448
No. I'm retired.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.245
Maestro, as I indicated you
In my letter, I work ...

03:25.371 --> 03:27.998
... For the Entitlements and Events
Office at the Buckingham Palace.

03:28.249 --> 03:32.002
- You work for the Queen?
- In a sense, yes.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.713
Good. I find Monarchies
so endearing.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.758
If I may, Maestro ...

03:38.092 --> 03:40.886
Why exactly do You find
the monarchy endearing?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.263
Well, because it's so vulnerable.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.600
You eliminate one person ...

03:46.893 --> 03:48.852
... And all of a sudden ...

03:49.020 --> 03:51.480
... The whole world changes.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.027
Like in a marriage.

03:58.363 --> 04:02.991
Maestro, Her Majesty The Queen
would be honoured to confer ..

04:03.034 --> 04:05.410
... The knighthood upon You
this coming June.

04:05.495 --> 04:09.915
- Good. - Her Majesty The Queen will be
de-lighted to learn you've accepted.

04:10.041 --> 04:15.170
Her Majesty The Queen has never been
de-lighted at anything.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.422
Well... What is more

04:17.798 --> 04:21.385
Your investiture,
just so happens to coincide ...

04:21.427 --> 04:24.554
... With the birthday of His Royal
Highness the Prince Philip.

04:24.681 --> 04:28.892
And the queen would very much like
to give him a concert by the BBC orchestra.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.144
I donâ€™t conduct any more.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.274
- I'm sure you have not
forgotten how it's done. - No.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.776
I haven't forgotten
how it's done.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.696
Prince Philip and the Queen
will be simply ecstatic ...

04:40.905 --> 04:43.949
... To hear you conduct your famous
"Simple Songs".

04:46.327 --> 04:50.455
I wil not conduct
my "Simple Songs".

04:51.165 --> 04:53.083
Why not?

04:53.459 --> 04:55.961
Personal reasons.

04:57.213 --> 05:00.340
The great soprano Sumi Jo
has agreed to sing.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.050
Sumi Jo won't do.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.595
Tell me which soprano will do
and you should have her.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.933
No one will do.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.884
Very well.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.970
I shall relay our conversation
to the Queen.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.352
Good day, Maestro.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.036
Do you see that?

06:11.913 --> 06:14.039
Is that him?

06:14.165 --> 06:15.749
Why yes...

06:16.000 --> 06:18.502
It is! God!

06:20.546 --> 06:22.547
Angela!

07:49.594 --> 07:52.220
Melanie! Melanie!

09:02.041 --> 09:05.168
I was thinking today how You
and I have the same problem.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.964
- Is that so? - We've been
misunderstood our whole lives ...

09:09.090 --> 09:15.345
... because we are allowed ourselves
to give in just once to a little levity.

09:15.471 --> 09:18.723
Levity is an
irresistible temptation.

09:21.686 --> 09:26.231
I worked with all the great
European and American directors...

09:27.483 --> 09:31.111
... But I'll be remembered
forever for "Mister Q".

09:31.696 --> 09:34.322
For a fucking robot.

09:34.490 --> 09:39.119
I had to wear suit of armour
that weighted two hundred pounds.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.745
You couldn't even see my face.

09:40.871 --> 09:44.124
But every five minutes somebody
has to come up and remind me ...

09:44.250 --> 09:46.209
... I did "Mister Q".

09:46.502 --> 09:51.089
The same way they remind You
that You did the "Simple Songs".

09:52.508 --> 09:54.342
And they forget ...

09:54.635 --> 09:57.971
That you also composed
"The Black Prism" ...

09:58.764 --> 10:01.516
... "Life of Hadrian" and all the rest.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.103
Because levity also ...

10:05.271 --> 10:07.230
A perversion.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.235
What are you doing in Europe?

10:13.237 --> 10:17.032
I'm doing a new film in Germany.
Starting in a month.

10:17.783 --> 10:22.162
- I am developing the role.
- Is it a light-hearted role?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.289
That depends on your point of view.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.791
And is all going well?

10:30.296 --> 10:31.796
We'll see.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.384
Well, it's late for me.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.136
Not for me.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.679
Good night.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.116
Did You take a piss today?

11:42.118 --> 11:43.702
Twice.

11:45.121 --> 11:49.749
- Four drops. You?
- Same. More or less.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.751
More? Or less?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.212
Less.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.843
Look how beautiful they are.

12:00.570 --> 12:01.640
Beautiful

12:02.000 --> 12:05.140
If you only knew how moving it is
to see them working on the script.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.975
They're so passionate.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.227
You see these two?

12:10.604 --> 12:13.898
They are falling in love
but they don't know it yet.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.026
- And how do you know?
- I know because I know ...

12:17.361 --> 12:20.155
... Everything there is
to know about love.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.116
Maybe you'll have to give me
some lessons ... one day.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.285
It's late now.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.650
- Have you heard the latest?
- No.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.669
Joyce Owens, Miss Universe,
is coming to stay.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.298
Apparently, one of her prizes is
a free week in our hotel.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.300
Yeah, I heard.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.428
But It seems more like a punishment
than a prize to me.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.805
How's the script coming?

12:46.015 --> 12:47.682
It's going to be masterpiece.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.810
And my testament.

12:51.812 --> 12:55.273
And Brenda is going to be
an unforgettable leading lady.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.567
We came upon a title today:

12:58.694 --> 13:00.779
"Life's last day."

13:01.155 --> 13:02.697
What do you think?

13:03.073 --> 13:05.450
that's good, good.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.453
I'm going to get some sleep.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.581
Good night!

13:12.917 --> 13:15.210
Good night.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.560
That guy who levitates is out here.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.313
I've been coming here for years.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.065
He has never levitated.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.696
So, where did You decide to go?

15:07.656 --> 15:11.034
We're going to Polynesia
for two weeks.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.536
- Julian might go overboard
as usual. - Good.

15:13.704 --> 15:17.040
You're going to be be glad to have the room
to yourself now. I've just been at your way.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.709
Not at all. You've kept me company.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.961
Mick is working ...

15:22.212 --> 15:24.464
- And I get bored.
- You're not gonna be bored for a minute ...

15:24.715 --> 15:28.301
... Because I have arranged the full service
for you: You're going to have

15:28.344 --> 15:33.097
a massage, sauna, check ups
with the doctor every single day.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.059
To help you get back in shape.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.354
At my age, getting in shape
is merely a waste of time.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.189
And I will get even more bored.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.983
You are victim of your own
apathies, Daddy.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.070
Why don't you guys go to Venice
one of these days?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.948
You could bring flowers to Mommy.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.583
I've been meaning to tell you...

16:00.751 --> 16:03.836
The French have emailed me
every single day. They ...

16:04.838 --> 16:07.882
Insist that you write your
memoires. What should I do?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.845
Let them insist.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.360
I'm going to call you
as soon as I get there.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.907
Bye Daddy.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.867
Have fun!

16:38.038 --> 16:40.873
Would you mind turning
on your back, please?

17:14.950 --> 17:17.285
After pain come pleasure.

17:17.327 --> 17:20.329
And then ... pain again.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.840
- How is it going, Mr. Ballinger?
- It's going.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.468
I don't know where, but it's going.

17:41.310 --> 17:45.104
My daughter says I'm apathetic.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.733
You see ... Is it that obvious?

17:51.236 --> 17:54.238
You've been watching too many movies,
you idiot, you've forgotten what life is about.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.865
- Exactly!
- Well, movies are life!

17:55.991 --> 17:57.366
All you know how to do is criticize

17:57.493 --> 17:59.077
If you only has some inspiration
for once ...

17:59.328 --> 18:00.745
Exactly!

18:00.871 --> 18:03.122
Inspiration! Didn't they teach at the film
school that inspiration does not exist?

18:03.248 --> 18:05.124
Inspiration is a lie.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.336
There is no such thing as inspiration.
Only fermentation.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.879
- Exactly.
- Inspiration exists, all right ...

18:10.005 --> 18:12.256
You just don't recognise it
because you have zero talent.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.384
- Exactly.
- What the fuck are you doing?

18:15.511 --> 18:17.637
- Agreeing with everyone?
- Yeah, of course!

18:17.888 --> 18:19.889
I am timid and insecure.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.642
My parents never gave me
any encouragement.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.227
I never had a girlfriend ...

18:24.394 --> 18:27.355
And I have some serious doubts
about my sexual orientation.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.524
Stop! It'll not go into move.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.776
Well I has polio.

18:32.027 --> 18:35.279
Don't you dare to accuse me of having
no talent again, you idiot.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.907
Now there is not the time for fermentation.
You talentless parasite!

18:38.117 --> 18:40.743
That's enough, you're really
getting on my nerves.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.662
We have to come up with an ending.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.414
And you waste your time
talking Philosophy and Big Ideas.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.500
He is on his deathbed ...

18:47.918 --> 18:49.669
He can barely talk ...

18:50.420 --> 18:52.421
He whispers to his wife:

18:53.048 --> 18:54.799
"Don't cry, honey."

18:55.134 --> 19:00.513
"You know, I've always found women
who weep frivolent and repulsive. "

19:00.556 --> 19:03.057
- Nice!
- That's a totally asinine idea.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.809
What else?

19:23.078 --> 19:24.954
You won't fool me!

19:25.831 --> 19:28.833
I know that you can't levitate.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.379
That's everything?

20:20.886 --> 20:23.137
Don't you need anything?

20:33.649 --> 20:36.150
- What do you need band-aids for?
- I don't.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.737
I'm doing it out of solidarity
with you.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.657
Ah, fuck you.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.998
You pay.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.418
Do you remember Gilda?

20:55.671 --> 20:58.130
- The film?
- No, Gilda Black.

20:58.173 --> 21:01.300
The girl that we were both
in love with.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.636
Gilda Black?

21:03.679 --> 21:07.014
What are you ...
Have to remind me up for?

21:07.182 --> 21:09.308
That was a hundred years ago.

21:10.435 --> 21:13.187
To me it seems like yesterday.

21:14.314 --> 21:18.651
I would have given twenty years of my life
to have slept with her.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.070
Well, that would've been
a pretty stupid thing.

21:21.154 --> 21:24.073
Guilda Black wasn't worth
twenty years of life.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.284
She wasn't worth a single day.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.787
How do you know?

21:30.956 --> 21:32.790
Did you sleep with her?

21:33.041 --> 21:35.084
What? What did you say?

21:35.335 --> 21:37.086
You heard me.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.547
Sixty years ago you swore
you never slept with her ...

21:39.589 --> 21:41.966
... out of respect of my love for her.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.593
Now you've changed your tune.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.848
Look...

21:49.099 --> 21:52.226
- I have something to confess.
- Fine, go ahead!

21:52.728 --> 21:54.437
The real tragedy ...

21:54.563 --> 21:57.481
And, believe me, it really is a tragedy ...

21:57.858 --> 22:01.861
Is that I can't even remember
if I slept with Gilda Black.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.948
- Are you serious?
- I swear.

22:09.578 --> 22:13.998
I'm wondering what happens
to your memory over time.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.627
I can't remember my family.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.005
I don't remember...

22:21.340 --> 22:24.133
Their faces or how they talked.

22:26.511 --> 22:30.264
Last night I was watching Lena
while she was asleep.

22:30.515 --> 22:33.642
And I was thinking about
all the thousands of little things ...

22:33.769 --> 22:37.271
... That I done for her as her father.

22:37.856 --> 22:42.651
And I done them deliberately
so that she would remember them ...

22:42.736 --> 22:44.904
... When she grows up.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.114
But in time ...

22:47.407 --> 22:49.909
... She won't remember a single thing.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.998
Tremendous effort, Mick,
you know.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.045
Tremendous efforts, Mick.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.131
With a modest result.

25:19.809 --> 25:23.312
They're going to talk tonight, mostly.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.191
I will bet you thirty Swiss francs ...

25:27.776 --> 25:30.152
... They don't say a word
the entire dinner.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.697
I'm so sure they are going to talk.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.785
- I'll raise you to fifty.
- Done.

25:45.085 --> 25:48.295
Including the last few days, err ...

25:48.338 --> 25:53.842
... You owe me 250 Swiss francs.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.866
Today?

26:18.201 --> 26:20.619
Not today. You?

26:23.957 --> 26:25.499
Nothing.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.753
Let's hope we take a piss tomorrow.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.797
That's great, Nick.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.550
I'm glad you liked
the second draft.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.510
Sure, we will work some more
on the ending.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.554
I'll talk to Brenda,
everything is all set.

27:21.181 --> 27:25.059
She can't wait. When is she ever going
to get a part like this at her age, come on!

27:25.310 --> 27:29.688
If it's okay with you, I'd like to start
scouting locations next month

27:29.814 --> 27:31.774
- Perfect. Bye!
- Yeah.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.943
What happened to you?

27:35.278 --> 27:38.072
You look like you've been to a funeral.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.450
Your son...

27:41.660 --> 27:44.328
- Has left my daughter.
- Fuck!

27:44.412 --> 27:47.581
- What are you talking about?
- They were boarding a plane to Polynesia.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.417
And right there, in the tunnel
he stops ...

27:50.460 --> 27:55.339
... And tells her that he's fallen
in love with another woman.

27:56.841 --> 28:00.344
Nothing like being in the tunnel
to make you feel you are in the tunnel.

28:00.428 --> 28:04.348
How fond! You're quite a magician
of metaphor.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.850
And he took this other woman
on vacation?

28:06.976 --> 28:10.187
At least he had the good taste
not to do so. At least

28:10.230 --> 28:11.730
And Lena?

28:11.856 --> 28:13.982
Lena is in her room.
Crying her eyes out.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.486
I've never seen anyone crying
that much in my life.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.489
I read somewhere that tear ducts
can produce tears for three days ...

28:20.573 --> 28:23.242
... Without stop.
- Yeah, I heard that too.

28:23.326 --> 28:26.328
- Yep.
- It was in that BBC documentary.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.580
He's on his deathbed
and he says to her:

28:28.623 --> 28:32.876
"Let's watch one more final
BBC documentary together, darling. "

28:33.002 --> 28:34.086
Okay, guys, knock it off.

28:34.129 --> 28:37.756
I'm not sure that's true, though.
About the tear ducts. I read that ...

28:37.882 --> 28:39.466
... Somewhere in the popular magazine ...

28:39.509 --> 28:42.386
... And they tend to exaggerate.
Better for sales.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.889
- I think you're getting off the mark.
- I think you're right.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.517
Julian is such a shit!

28:48.727 --> 28:53.021
- Just like his mother. Remember? - Yeah.
- I'm going to call my shithead son.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.650
What are you gonna do? Try and convince him
to get back with Lena? It's hopeless.

28:56.776 --> 29:00.988
Julian, this is your father. Even though,
at this point, based on the evidences ...

29:01.030 --> 29:03.157
... I'm not so sure
you're my son.

29:34.522 --> 29:38.317
How are you always
so sure...

29:38.401 --> 29:40.319
... They aren't going to speak?

29:40.945 --> 29:43.405
I know something about them.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.949
- The waiter told me.
- What?

29:46.075 --> 29:49.077
- I'm not going to tell you.
- Tell me right this minute.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.206
Besides, I can always get the waiter
to tell me too ... With a bribe.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.792
All right, I'll tell you.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.336
They are mute.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.839
You little shit!

30:01.049 --> 30:03.217
Give me back my money! All of it!

30:03.426 --> 30:05.344
You're so gullible!

30:05.470 --> 30:07.721
It was a joke.
They are not mute.

30:18.107 --> 30:20.192
What the hell is going on?

30:20.235 --> 30:22.444
Well, that's really rather banal, Dad.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.738
I fell in love with
another woman.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.866
- It was all of eighteen, right?
- No, Dad, she is not eighteen.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.743
She is thirty. Reasonable age.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.746
Well, however old she is,
You've really fucked up.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.206
That is your opinion.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.125
Lena is
an extraordinary woman.

30:37.210 --> 30:40.504
- At this point, of course, you've realized that
she is completely wasted on you. - Perhaps.

30:40.588 --> 30:44.132
- She is far too intelligent for you.
- Why did you make me come here?

30:44.217 --> 30:47.386
- I'm not about to change my mind.
- That's what they all say at the beginning.

30:47.470 --> 30:50.764
Then eventually they wind up begging
their spouse to take them back.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.852
Mom left you.
She never begged you to take her back.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.107
What did I tell you?

31:00.149 --> 31:02.734
You see now where he gets this from,
this asshole?

31:02.777 --> 31:07.406
- Well, are we allowed to know who this whore
that you've fallen in love with? - Me.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.659
I am the woman Julian
lost his head for.

31:10.785 --> 31:13.537
Ad we're going to get married
as soon as his divorce is finalized.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.290
And who the fuck are you?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.792
I'm Paloma Faith.

31:19.252 --> 31:22.296
And I'm not a whore ...
I'm the singer.

31:22.922 --> 31:26.300
Excuse me, miss ...
Do you mind giving us a moment alone?

31:27.927 --> 31:30.804
Okay, but not for too long.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.308
Forgive me, Julian.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.810
But I'm really trying to understand ...

31:37.437 --> 31:40.898
Lena is a beautiful woman,
a dream.

31:40.940 --> 31:47.070
And this one here is the most
insignificant woman on the face of the planet.

31:47.530 --> 31:50.032
What the fuck do you see in her?

31:51.951 --> 31:55.412
- You really want to know?
- Yes, Julian, I really want to know.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.716
She is really good in bed.

32:12.680 --> 32:17.059
- So who is this bitch?
- Her name is Paloma Faith.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.855
- And what does she do?
- The most obscene job in the world.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.107
She is a prostitute?

32:24.233 --> 32:26.485
Worse. She is a pop star.

32:27.236 --> 32:29.071
Pop star...

32:29.864 --> 32:32.240
What was that the Julian said about her?

32:33.076 --> 32:34.993
I've already told you.

32:35.078 --> 32:38.455
No you didn't. All you did was you babbled
incomprehensibly. You didn't tell me.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.708
No. It was Julian who did bubbling.
He was not right in the head.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.878
Doesn't seem that way to me!

32:45.129 --> 32:47.631
He must've made twenty decisions
in two hours ...

32:49.008 --> 32:51.969
He moved out,
He found an apartment ...

32:52.011 --> 32:54.638
... He spoke on the phone
with a divorce lawyer.

32:54.889 --> 32:57.599
It does not really seem
like a confused man to me.

32:57.767 --> 33:00.644
You keep on saying to me that
this woman is ugly and insignificant.

33:00.853 --> 33:04.523
So what is it
that Julian sees in her that...

33:04.774 --> 33:06.650
He didn't see in me?

33:07.902 --> 33:09.653
Now. How should I know?

33:09.737 --> 33:12.489
Because you said that Mick
asked him!

33:13.783 --> 33:16.284
- Did I?
- Yes. Yes, that's what you said.

33:16.369 --> 33:19.913
- So I wanna know what was Julians response.
- I don't remember.

33:20.039 --> 33:23.041
Oh God,
You're really pissing me of now, Daddy.

33:23.126 --> 33:26.628
You remember perfectly well
you are a horrible liar.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.296
I swear...

33:28.381 --> 33:31.299
He was just mumbling some idiocy.

33:31.426 --> 33:36.888
If you don't tell me I swear I am
going to scream right here and now.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.641
I want to know what he said.

33:40.268 --> 33:45.439
What the fuck does this bitch have,
at least according to Julian, that I don't?

33:45.565 --> 33:47.816
I want to know.
I want to know what he said!

33:49.902 --> 33:51.653
He said...

33:51.946 --> 33:53.655
Yes...

33:56.576 --> 33:58.452
She was good in bed.

34:09.464 --> 34:12.049
You didn't have to tell me that.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.648
Believe me, Lena.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.776
I can understand you.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.613
Really, I can.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.745
You can understand me?

35:24.664 --> 35:26.540
Like hell you can!

35:27.917 --> 35:30.293
Mommy would've been able
to understand me.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.630
Mommy found herself in the same situation ...

35:33.923 --> 35:37.801
... I'm in now with you not once,
but dozens of times ...

35:37.885 --> 35:39.928
She was pretending not to know.

35:40.555 --> 35:44.808
You had a stream of women,
but she just kept going ...

35:45.810 --> 35:48.937
... Not just for us children,
but above all for you.

35:49.063 --> 35:51.690
She loved you
and so she forgave you.

35:52.441 --> 35:55.569
No matter what happened,
she still wanted to be with you.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.657
But who were you? Who?

36:02.326 --> 36:05.036
It's what I've always asked myself.

36:05.079 --> 36:09.958
You never gave anything ...
not to her, not to me, nothing.

36:10.793 --> 36:15.088
You gave everything to your music.
Music, music, music!

36:15.173 --> 36:19.426
There was nothing else in your life.
Only music and arrogance.

36:19.594 --> 36:23.722
Never a caress, never a hug,
never a kiss, nothing.

36:24.682 --> 36:27.726
You never knew anything
about your children.

36:27.852 --> 36:31.479
You never knew if we were happy,
if we were suffering. Nothing.

36:32.315 --> 36:35.442
Everything was on Mommy's shoulders.

36:35.484 --> 36:40.113
At home the only thing you would say
to her were the two words: "Quiet, Melanie."

36:40.239 --> 36:43.491
And Mom would explain to us:
"Quiet, Daddy is composing".

36:43.618 --> 36:46.203
"Quiet, Daddy is resting,
he has a concert tonight. "

36:46.370 --> 36:48.371
"Quiet, Daddy is on the phone
with someone important. "

36:48.497 --> 36:52.375
"Quiet, Daddy has Stravinsky
coming to the house later tonight".

36:52.501 --> 36:56.379
He wanted to be a Stravinsky, but
he never had a single drop of his genius.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.506
"Quiet, Melanie!"

36:58.591 --> 37:01.134
Were the only two things
you knew how to say.

37:01.844 --> 37:03.970
You didn't know the first thing
about my mother!

37:04.138 --> 37:06.389
You never bothered to
take care of her.

37:06.849 --> 37:10.644
And even now, you haven't brought
her flowers for ten years.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.647
And that letter!

37:14.899 --> 37:18.360
Do you think Mommy
never read it? Well, you're wrong.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.154
She found it and she read it
and I've read it too.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.990
But you probably don't even
remember that letter. But we do.

37:24.242 --> 37:28.036
The letter we found in which you
professed your love for another man.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.289
Mommy had to enjoy
that humiliation too.

37:31.374 --> 37:35.794
"My necessary experimentation
in sexual matters" as you put it.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.796
So your musical experimentation
wasn't enough for you.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.799
No! You had to experiment
in homosexuality too!

37:41.175 --> 37:45.011
You didn't give a fuck about
all the anguish you've caused her.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.305
So don't you come telling me
that you can understand ...

37:47.431 --> 37:50.517
Because you don't understand
a fucking thing.

39:39.668 --> 39:42.128
Gracias.

40:04.944 --> 40:09.406
Stop telling me what to do!
If I want to bite my nail, I will!

41:39.663 --> 41:43.750
This morning I did this
big, powerful piss.

41:44.293 --> 41:47.420
I was so happy!
I haven't been so happy in a long time.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.048
Good. I am happy for you.

41:50.257 --> 41:52.509
No, it's only a joke, Mick. I mean it ...

41:52.551 --> 41:54.761
You know, it wasn't like that...

41:54.803 --> 41:58.806
You do not joke about these things, Fred.
The prostate is serious.

41:58.891 --> 42:01.309
You are always fall for my jokes, Mick.

42:01.393 --> 42:06.314
You've been believing
my every word for sixty years.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.816
I invent stories, Fred.

42:09.068 --> 42:12.445
I have to believe in everything
in order to make things up.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.964
Do you remember the other day?

42:31.215 --> 42:33.925
When you told me you don't remember
your parents any more?

42:34.176 --> 42:35.301
No, I don't remember.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.970
Of course you do.

42:37.054 --> 42:41.474
You made me realize that not only
I do not remember my parents any more ...

42:41.559 --> 42:46.229
... But my childhood, for example,
I do not remember a thing about it.

42:46.730 --> 42:50.733
- There is only one thing I still remember.
- What?

42:51.610 --> 42:55.822
The precise moment when I
learned how to ride a bike.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.199
And this morning ...

42:58.325 --> 43:00.243
As if by magic ...

43:02.496 --> 43:04.998
I remembered the moment right after ...

43:05.124 --> 43:07.083
When you fell off?

43:09.878 --> 43:13.756
- How the fuck did you know?
- Well, that happens to everybody.

43:13.841 --> 43:17.760
You learn something, you're happy
and then ... you forget to brake.

44:22.284 --> 44:25.578
- How is the work on the role going?
- Pretty well.

44:25.704 --> 44:30.333
- Actually, I've come up with some
interesting details. - Fine.

44:30.459 --> 44:34.337
Maybe the problem is that Julian and I
never had children.

44:34.963 --> 44:36.798
I don't know what the problem is ...

44:37.091 --> 44:39.967
But I'm not going to try and
cheer you up by lying...

44:40.219 --> 44:42.095
Or talk about things
I never knew about.

44:43.472 --> 44:45.306
You were right...

44:45.349 --> 44:47.684
Music is all I understand.

44:47.851 --> 44:48.976
Did you know why?

44:49.228 --> 44:53.481
Because you don't need words,
only experience to understand it.

44:53.732 --> 44:55.608
It just is.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.612
Your mother would've
understood you.

45:00.322 --> 45:02.240
I can't.

45:02.324 --> 45:04.701
But your mother is not here.

47:03.570 --> 47:05.613
What happened?

47:13.747 --> 47:16.249
Daddy, I have to tell you something.
It's ...

47:17.960 --> 47:19.585
... Personal.

47:20.712 --> 47:22.255
Tell me, Lena.

47:25.384 --> 47:27.343
Julian is an ass. Because ...

47:30.722 --> 47:32.974
... I'm really good in bed.

47:33.517 --> 47:35.268
I know.

47:37.771 --> 47:39.480
What do you mean "you know"?

47:39.773 --> 47:41.774
You're my daughter.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.402
And, in all modesty ...

47:44.486 --> 47:47.113
I was a wonder between the sheets.

47:48.782 --> 47:50.533
It's true!

48:25.569 --> 48:29.822
- Do you know who composed the piece
that you are practising? - No, who?

48:29.948 --> 48:32.700
- Me.
- I don't believe you.

48:33.201 --> 48:34.201
What's it called?

48:34.328 --> 48:37.663
- "Simple Song number 3"
- And what's the composers name?

48:38.081 --> 48:40.082
Fred Ballinger.

48:43.086 --> 48:46.088
- And you? What's your name?
- Fred Ballinger.

48:47.049 --> 48:49.675
You can check at the front desk.
I am staying here.

48:50.302 --> 48:52.845
- Incredible!
- Yeah, it's incredible.

48:53.221 --> 48:55.556
My teacher makes me play it.

48:55.599 --> 48:58.476
He says it's a perfect piece
to start with.

48:58.560 --> 49:02.980
- Yes, well he is right. It is very simple.
- It's not only simple.

49:03.607 --> 49:06.609
- Oh really?
- It's also really beautiful.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.571
Yes, it is beautiful.

49:11.073 --> 49:13.866
I composed it while I still loved.

49:22.250 --> 49:26.712
May I do something while you
still playing? Keep playing.

49:32.010 --> 49:33.970
There.

49:37.849 --> 49:40.226
Daddy, where you been?

49:40.394 --> 49:42.269
This man has been here
for over an hour.

49:42.521 --> 49:45.523
- He says he is the Queen emissary.
- Shit!

49:45.649 --> 49:48.734
I told him to make himself
comfortable in our room.

49:49.403 --> 49:51.153
Be nice!

49:52.155 --> 49:55.408
I was just wondering ...
If we could maybe ...

49:55.909 --> 49:59.120
- Head out on the terrace?
- No, it's too cold.

49:59.538 --> 50:01.872
But you can smoke those in here,
if you like.

50:02.165 --> 50:04.291
- Are you serious?
- Yes, yes.

50:04.376 --> 50:06.293
The hotel manager
is a music lover.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.546
And I get a very little privileges.

50:08.630 --> 50:10.881
You have no idea...

50:11.425 --> 50:13.551
The most pleasure this gives me.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.763
- Are you feeling tense?
- Awful.

50:21.518 --> 50:23.561
There you go!

50:23.645 --> 50:27.189
We don't have much time
so I'll skip the formalities.

50:27.399 --> 50:31.694
But I'm having the thorough cleansing
of my intestines.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.071
Bloody hell!

50:35.699 --> 50:39.201
Right, I was unable
to convince the queen.

50:39.453 --> 50:42.038
I relayed your reticence
about the "Songs" to her.

50:42.205 --> 50:44.957
I proposed
an alternative repertoire.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.835
An alternative musician,
an alternative evening.

50:47.961 --> 50:49.545
She does not want alternatives.

50:49.588 --> 50:51.797
She want you and only you and
only your "Simple Songs".

50:51.840 --> 50:54.216
She says it's all  that
Prince Philip listens to.

50:54.342 --> 50:58.095
Well, I don't want to be rude
but it's impossible.

50:59.431 --> 51:01.223
- Why?
- I told you.

51:01.349 --> 51:04.351
Last time we met ...
personal reasons.

51:05.979 --> 51:09.106
Is there no way to resolve
these "personal reasons"?

51:09.316 --> 51:11.484
Unfortunately, no.

51:13.445 --> 51:15.571
I am begging you, Maestro.

51:15.614 --> 51:19.617
I have a difficult job.  I simply have to
return to London with a positive answer.

51:19.868 --> 51:22.995
And my answer is ... negative.

51:24.372 --> 51:28.751
I don't understand...
What exactly doesn't work?

51:28.835 --> 51:30.503
Is it the date?

51:30.587 --> 51:34.256
Is it the location? Is it the orchestra?
Is it the soprano? Is it the Queen?

51:34.382 --> 51:38.761
Please don't insist.
Personal reasons.

51:38.887 --> 51:42.348
But what are these bloody
"personal reasons"?

51:42.390 --> 51:45.893
"Personal" means
I am not obliged to answer.

51:46.394 --> 51:49.772
Let's see if we can resolve
these personal problems. I mean ...

51:49.856 --> 51:52.108
What is it that's wrong?

51:52.400 --> 51:54.527
The soprano.

51:55.737 --> 51:59.657
- We'll get a different one then. Not a problem...
- It wouldn't make any difference.

51:59.741 --> 52:01.784
What, even Sumi Jo?
She is absolute best.

52:02.119 --> 52:06.997
I mean, she already expressed her enthusiasm
as to being directed by you! She's ecstatic!

52:07.040 --> 52:09.500
I am not interested.

52:10.127 --> 52:11.669
What is it you have against her?

52:11.795 --> 52:13.754
Nothing! I've never even met her.

52:13.880 --> 52:17.508
- You've never even met her? So what ...
- That's enough!

52:26.393 --> 52:28.269
I'm sorry...

52:28.562 --> 52:32.314
I just do not understand.
What exactly is the problem?

52:32.524 --> 52:36.443
The problem is that I composed
the "Simple Songs" for my wife.

52:36.653 --> 52:39.071
And only she
has ever performed them.

52:39.447 --> 52:41.907
And only she
has recorded them.

52:41.950 --> 52:46.078
And as long as I live,
she will be the only one to sing them.

52:46.663 --> 52:48.706
The problem is, dear sir ...

52:51.042 --> 52:54.545
... My wife can't sing any more.

53:02.470 --> 53:04.597
Have you understand?

53:05.182 --> 53:06.807
Do you?

53:07.976 --> 53:10.352
Yes, I do understand.

53:10.604 --> 53:13.189
I beg you a pardon, Maestro.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.698
Lena?

53:25.202 --> 53:26.702
Yes...?

53:27.454 --> 53:29.997
Stop crying.

53:30.749 --> 53:32.499
Please.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.628
OK.

54:12.290 --> 54:15.542
I'm going to give you
a different type of massage.

54:16.419 --> 54:18.295
Because you are stressed.

54:19.798 --> 54:21.882
No, to be precise ...

54:22.300 --> 54:23.884
You are not stressed.

54:24.177 --> 54:26.303
You are emotional.

54:27.013 --> 54:29.890
You understand everything
with your hands, don't you?

54:30.308 --> 54:33.686
We can understand all sorts of things
by touching.

54:35.939 --> 54:39.525
Who knows why people
are so afraid of touching?

54:40.694 --> 54:46.573
Maybe it's because they think it has
something to do with pleasure.

54:50.328 --> 54:53.664
That's just another good reason
for touching instead of talking.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.586
Don't you like to talk?

55:03.466 --> 55:05.676
I never have anything to say.

55:22.986 --> 55:25.487
Come, look.

55:29.117 --> 55:32.244
Now, listen.
Do you see that mountain over there?

55:33.496 --> 55:37.374
- Yes. It looks very close.
- Exactly.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.710
This is what you see
when you're young.

55:40.128 --> 55:42.379
Everything seems really close.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.256
And that's the future.

55:44.966 --> 55:46.842
And now...

55:52.390 --> 55:55.017
And that's what you see
when you're old.

55:55.101 --> 55:57.895
Everything seems really far away.

55:58.229 --> 56:00.147
That's the past.

56:12.035 --> 56:13.035
Brenda ...

56:13.411 --> 56:14.787
Can't wait to get started.

56:15.163 --> 56:19.666
And I am so proud of having
written this screenplay with you.

56:19.793 --> 56:22.044
I made twenty films,
but they all irrelevant.

56:22.170 --> 56:23.796
This is the only film ...

56:24.047 --> 56:26.173
That means anything to me.

56:26.299 --> 56:30.636
It's my sentimental, intellectual
and moral testament.

56:30.678 --> 56:33.180
So, let's toast to the completion
of the third draft ...

56:33.431 --> 56:35.557
Of ... "Life's last day."

56:35.683 --> 56:37.643
What about the ending, Mick?

56:38.686 --> 56:40.437
The ending?

56:40.814 --> 56:42.940
We'll come up with one sooner or later.

56:43.691 --> 56:45.818
Cheers!

56:51.699 --> 56:54.827
- Hello, Fred Ballinger.
- Hi.

56:55.453 --> 56:58.080
I wanted to tell you that
I checked at the front desk ...

56:58.164 --> 57:00.666
- And you're really Fred Ballinger.
- Good.

57:00.708 --> 57:03.669
I am glad to see you've put
your mind at rest on that score.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.213
There is something else
I wanted to tell you too.

57:06.464 --> 57:08.549
You go right ahead.

57:08.716 --> 57:12.428
I wanted to tell you that ever since you have
corrected the position of my elbow ...

57:13.096 --> 57:15.973
... I play better,
the sounds comes more natural.

57:16.057 --> 57:18.434
Good! You know why?

57:19.102 --> 57:21.103
Because you're left-handed.

57:21.354 --> 57:24.356
And all left-handed people
are irregular.

57:25.483 --> 57:29.445
- So an irregular position helps.
- I'm sorry.

57:31.614 --> 57:35.367
I am left-handed too.

57:39.873 --> 57:43.709
Christ! The whole world knows
you are left-handed.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.716
Thank you.

58:46.523 --> 58:48.148
I am Luca.

58:49.776 --> 58:51.818
Luca Moroder.

58:53.571 --> 58:55.447
Hello.

58:56.032 --> 58:57.574
I am a mountaineer.

58:58.701 --> 59:00.077
And I teach climbing.

59:00.203 --> 59:04.289
- I give lessons here at the hotel.
- Oh ... - And you?

59:05.708 --> 59:07.709
What do you do?

59:08.169 --> 59:09.795
I have two jobs.

59:09.963 --> 59:14.550
I'm a daughter and I also
an assistant to my father.

59:16.344 --> 59:19.179
- Two jobs ...
- Yeah...

59:26.354 --> 59:28.981
This is a Forerunner 620.

59:30.108 --> 59:32.734
It has a colour touch display.

59:32.986 --> 59:35.487
It can estimate
VO2max ...

59:35.613 --> 59:40.117
... The  maximum rate of oxygen consumption
during maximum excursion.

59:40.201 --> 59:42.828
I would like to give one to my cousin
for a Christmas.

59:43.371 --> 59:45.622
We always go climbing together.

59:47.375 --> 59:48.959
He was supposed to be here too ...

59:49.002 --> 59:51.962
But he slipped in the bathtub
and broke his femur.

59:53.006 --> 59:56.258
Bathtubs are more
dangerous than Everest.

59:57.135 --> 59:59.094
How true!

59:59.762 --> 01:00:03.640
Do you know what I found once
on the K2 summit?

01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:07.978
No. What?

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:11.857
A bedside table.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:15.527
- That's not true.
- Yes it is.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:18.155
I opened the drawer.

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:21.742
But it was empty.

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:27.998
It is an amazing feeling -
climbing, you know?

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:31.543
A real sense of freedom.

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.920
All I feel is fear.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:39.301
That is an amazing feeling too,
you know?

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:46.058
So who is the most talented actress
you've ever worked with, Mr. Boyle?

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:49.770
Brenda Morel,
without a doubt. A genius!

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.814
She couldn't have read more
than two books in her life ...

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.442
And one of them was
an autobiography ...

01:00:55.526 --> 01:00:57.527
... Written by a ghost writer, naturally.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.822
- A genius, in what sense?
- If you know how to steal ...

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:04.951
... You do not need training.
Stealing becomes your education.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.828
That's how Brenda is.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.081
Even when, thanks to my films,
she became a diva ...

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.416
... She never forgotten
where she was from.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.585
The street was her real home.

01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:16.088
And that's where she stayed, stealing ...

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:18.298
Everything.

01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:21.593
Which is how she created such
unforgettable characters.

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.845
And won two Oscars.

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:30.495
Climb on my shoulders.

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:42.132
Okay.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.426
Now, as we climb ...

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:47.554
Look down.

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:51.808
See how beautiful
the world is from up here.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:01.193
So the French called again.

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:05.197
They really want to do that book
with you, your memoirs.

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.949
But they want the whole picture:
they want your Life, your work...

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:11.536
- What should I say?
- Tell them ...

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.335
Tell them what?

01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:22.464
To forget me!

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:27.594
Tell them that I'm retired.
I'm done ...

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:32.974
- ... with work and with life.
- Cut the crap!

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.102
Your music convene ...

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:38.730
... Surprising new emotions.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.858
Emotions can be overrated too, Mick.

01:03:45.738 --> 01:03:49.741
These shows are really pathetic.
All that's missing is a mime.

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:54.246
- We usually get one of those
by the end of the season as well. - Good.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.763
Excuse me Mr. Tree,
Miss Universe is here.

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:22.023
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.776
I am huge fan of yours.

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:27.737
I mean, I'm literally went crazy
when you played "Mr. Q".

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:32.617
I never miss robot movies.
But that one is - my favourite.

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:34.411
Thank you.

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:39.541
Do you ever watch any kinds of films
other than robot movies?

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:41.918
Of course!

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:45.422
I've got my whole life ahead of me
and I want to be an actress.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:49.885
I don't want to just rely
on my beauty.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:55.432
Well, do you study?
Or you just watch reality TV?

01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:03.815
I appreciate the irony ...

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.777
... But when it is deranged and poisoned
it is a train of its force ...

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:12.324
... And it reveals something else.

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:15.535
What?

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:18.288
Frustration.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:21.833
I am frustrated, Miss Universe?

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.961
I am happy I took part
in "Miss Universe" pageant.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:28.340
Are you happy you've played "Mister Q"?

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:49.444
She is not at all stupid,
Miss Universe.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.488
Not at all!

01:06:47.294 --> 01:06:49.295
I saw you in a film once.

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:53.883
So you like "Mister Q" as well?

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.761
No.

01:06:56.929 --> 01:07:00.807
I saw you in that film that you've
played a father who never knew his son.

01:07:00.891 --> 01:07:04.769
And he meets him for the first time in a highway
diner when his son is already 14 years.

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:08.440
Nobody saw that movie!

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:11.651
There was that dialogue that I really liked.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:15.280
When your son says:
"Why weren't you a father to me?"

01:07:15.322 --> 01:07:17.157
And you say:

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.701
"I didn't think I was up to it."

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:23.038
At that moment I understood
some really important.

01:07:24.331 --> 01:07:25.415
What?

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.334
That no one in the world
feels up to it.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:31.671
So there is no reason
to worry.

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.299
Bye. See you at the hotel.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:45.560
- What do you do all day, Fred?
- They tell me that I am apathetic.

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:47.479
So, I don't do anything.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:49.939
Don't you miss your work?

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:52.108
Not at all.

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.486
I worked far too much anyway.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:59.074
- So what do you miss?
- I miss my wife.

01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:01.076
My wife Melanie.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.123
I read on Wikipedia ...

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.501
... That you hanged out with Stravinsky ...

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:12.337
- For a while when you were young.
- Yes, I did.

01:08:12.379 --> 01:08:14.214
What was he like?

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:17.591
He was very ... classy ....

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.261
Classy? That's all?

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.850
Be generous with me, Fred.
I need a generous friend.

01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:28.603
Tell me about Stravinsky.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.729
He once said that

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.899
"Intellectuals have no taste."

01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:37.028
From that moment on I did
everything I could ...

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.281
... not to become an intellectual.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.908
And I succeeded.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.372
And you? What do you miss?

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:51.501
Nothing ...
It's very luckily.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.296
Come on
Be generous with me, Jimmy.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:00.760
What I miss I discovered ...

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.555
... Four months ago
while reading Novalis.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.683
You've read Novalis?

01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:09.644
Even the actors from California ...

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:14.566
... When they're not getting drunk, selling
coke and hanging out with anorexic models ...

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.776
... occasionally read Novalis.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.571
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:23.658
I'm just an old man
with prejudices.

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.578
And what does Novalis say?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.457
"I'm always going home."

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:36.296
"Always going to my father's house."

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.763
What are you thinking about?

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:34.354
The future.

01:11:46.927 --> 01:11:51.180
He is on his deathbed
and murmurs to her:

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:53.850
"I should've devoted myself to you ..."

01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:56.352
"..and to Our Love ..."

01:11:56.478 --> 01:12:02.233
"..instead of wasting my life trying to
become the king of the insurance policies. "

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:09.449
Maybe he says something banal to her:

01:12:10.075 --> 01:12:11.993
Real simple. Like:

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.746
"Take care of yourself."

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:23.129
No, we have to stay with
the physical pain right until the end.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.507
How about he says:

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.262
"Not even morphine
can help me now. "

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:37.226
What if he focuses on some
insignificant detail?

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:40.229
If he said something like:

01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:45.985
"I wonder whatever happened to that
key ring you gave me 25 years ago! "

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:48.654
"The one that the shaped
Like a horseshoe."

01:12:50.407 --> 01:12:56.871
No. He, doesn't say anything
on his deathbed.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.752
She's the one who talks.

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:05.922
Brenda.

01:13:07.674 --> 01:13:09.675
She says:

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:14.806
"I lost so much time
because of you, Michael. "

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:20.812
"I lost the best years
of my life."

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.310
Good morning.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.939
I have never told you
how sorry I am about...

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:30.441
... How things ended
between you and Julian.

01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:34.695
I mean, I want to apologize
for his behaviour.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.156
You don't have to apologize,
It's not your fault.

01:15:41.161 --> 01:15:42.954
Let's face it.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.290
As a father, I could've done more.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.335
Let's face it, Julian
picked up the scent.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.421
I've started to smell that too.

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:58.094
- What scent?
- Scent of freedom.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.931
Oh, right. I know this scent.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:07.061
Daddy didn't really say anything
to you about the Queen?

01:16:07.604 --> 01:16:12.441
About how she has asked him to conduct
the "Simple Songs" in London and how he said "No"?

01:16:12.484 --> 01:16:16.612
- He didn't tell me a thing.
- Gosh, you guys have got a strange friendship.

01:16:17.322 --> 01:16:20.700
Strange? No, it's not strange.
It's a good friendship.

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:24.954
And in a good friendships
you only tell each other the good things.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:28.249
He must've thought the Queen's
concert wasn't one of them.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:32.003
You know, he said the reason he can't
conduct the "Simple Songs" ...

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:35.590
... Was because my Mother was the only
on Earth who could sing them.

01:16:35.632 --> 01:16:40.386
- He said that? - He said that to the
Queen's emissary.

01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:45.266
It took him eighty years
to finally say something romantic ...

01:16:45.517 --> 01:16:48.519
And he goes and says that
to the Queen's emissary.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:57.403
Sometimes when I sleep at night
he watches me.

01:16:57.487 --> 01:17:01.657
And last night, he stroke my cheek
for the first time in my life.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:04.910
Only I wasn't asleep,
I was pretending to be asleep.

01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:13.669
Parents know when their children
are pretending to be asleep.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.801
It's years, since you went
to see Melanie.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.637
Why don't you go?

01:17:23.013 --> 01:17:25.431
Venice is so close.

01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:29.435
Don't you agree?

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:35.066
- There is something that is keeps
getting into my head. - What?

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:41.197
What it would've been like
to have slept with Gilda Black!

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:48.329
Yeah! I wonder too.

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:54.960
Liar!

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:20.569
You know what's the difference
between you and me?

01:18:21.446 --> 01:18:23.364
What.

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.991
Ultimately ...

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:29.620
... I never liked life
well enough.

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:53.144
Brenda wanted to play
Eva Braun a hundred years ago.

01:18:53.770 --> 01:18:55.604
She spent six months
working on her role.

01:18:55.647 --> 01:18:59.400
I have been studying all the
hotel guests for a weeks now.

01:18:59.776 --> 01:19:04.280
I've been meticulously observing
you, Fred, Lena ...

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.492
The Russians, the Arabs,
the young and the old.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.620
And I have finally come
to a conclusion ...

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:15.791
... I have to choose.

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:18.919
I have to choose what is really
worth telling.

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.630
The Horror or Desire?

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.675
And I chose the Desire.

01:19:25.635 --> 01:19:28.512
You, each one of you ...

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.391
... You opened my eyes.

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:38.564
You made me see that I should not be wasting
my time on the senselessness of Horror.

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:43.068
It came to this,
I can't play Hitler.

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:46.447
I want to tell about your Desire,
my Desire.

01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:49.450
So pure, so impossible,
so immoral ...

01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:52.703
... But it doesn't matter
because that's what makes us alive.

01:22:03.543 --> 01:22:05.085
Who is she?

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.921
God!

01:22:07.797 --> 01:22:10.049
What do you mean
"Who is she"?

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:13.218
Miss Universe.

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:17.056
But she looks all different.

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:20.309
Unrecognisable.

01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:23.812
She's been transformed.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.857
From watching all those
robot movies.

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:30.069
Excuse me, Mr. Boyle.

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:32.988
There is someone here
to see you.

01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:37.743
Can't you see we are enjoying ...

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:41.205
... The last great idillia
of our lives?

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:45.000
Well, who was
the pretender there?

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.753
Brenda Morel.

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:51.256
Brenda Morel?

01:22:52.008 --> 01:22:53.759
Here?

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:08.273
What the hell is this?
It looks like an accident.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:11.276
It's called "Alpine prison".

01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:13.487
By a local artist.

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:19.493
- Human beings really know how to be
pathetic when try to, don't they? - Yes.

01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:25.040
Brenda!

01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:29.920
What a fabulous, marvellous
surprise!

01:23:30.922 --> 01:23:32.881
Hi, Mick.

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:39.680
You look fabulous, Brenda.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.808
The very picture of radiance
has the sex appeal.

01:23:42.934 --> 01:23:47.187
You're getting mixed up with the
last millennium, Mick.

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.567
What? You're not going to
just wait any longer?

01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:53.819
We just finished
the latest version, you know?

01:23:53.903 --> 01:23:56.196
We were having trouble
with the last scene ...

01:23:56.281 --> 01:24:00.325
But then, yesterday, eureka!
It came to us!

01:24:00.785 --> 01:24:03.662
So now that you are here in the flesh ...

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.706
We can hand it to you.

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:08.709
But didn't you tell to me
you're going to be in Los Angeles?

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:12.337
What are you doing in Europe?
Brenda?

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:16.341
How many years we've known each other, Mick?

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:20.095
Jesus, you put me on the spot!

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.307
- Let me count ...
- 53 years.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:28.353
- How many films have we done together?
- Nine, ten ... - Eleven.

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:33.692
So after 53 years of friendship
and eleven films together ...

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:37.446
... You don't think I am going to start
to bullshit you now, do you? You of all people...

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:40.616
No, I don't ...
I wouldn't deserve that.

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.993
That's right ... you don't deserve it.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:45.871
You deserve me to call
spade "a spade".

01:24:46.706 --> 01:24:50.626
Which is why I dragged
my ass here from L.A.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:54.004
- To talk to you in person.
- Look, Brenda ...

01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:59.009
If it's about the scene 21
Where you described as "ugly ..."

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:01.095
"..feeble, pale shadow of your
former beauty "...

01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:05.474
...Please, realize that's just
a poetic license.

01:25:05.725 --> 01:25:08.268
I want you to be extraordinary.

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:11.855
You still preserve intact ...

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:14.149
And you have to...

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:17.653
That mystery with that a look
you've had when you first became a diva.

01:25:17.737 --> 01:25:19.530
Stop licking my ass, Mick.

01:25:19.906 --> 01:25:22.533
It just breaks my balls even more.

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:26.286
Especially, given what have I come to tell you.

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:29.039
Why? What have you come to tell me?

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.545
I'm not going to be in the movie, Mick.

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.552
What?

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:45.556
They offered me a TV series in
the Mexico with three-year contract.

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:49.434
An alcoholic grandmother who suffered
a serious stroke.

01:25:50.186 --> 01:25:54.189
A character has got real balls,
but with the money ...

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:57.276
... I can pay for Jack's
drug rehab ...

01:25:57.318 --> 01:26:00.070
... I can pay off the debts of my
idiotic future ex-husband ...

01:26:00.196 --> 01:26:03.574
And I'll still have enough money left over
to buy a house in Miami ...

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.451
... Which is something
I wanted to do for 14 years.

01:26:06.911 --> 01:26:09.163
That's why I've come to tell you this.

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.046
But this is cinema, Brenda!

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:20.799
That's just television.
And television is shit.

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:23.719
No, and television is the future, Mick ...

01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:26.972
In fact, to tell the truth, it's also the present.

01:26:30.476 --> 01:26:33.812
Look, let's be frank.

01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:37.316
Because nobody ever speaks frankly
in this fucking film world.

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.610
You're going on eighty ...

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:43.697
... And like most of your colleagues,
you're getting worse with age.

01:26:46.117 --> 01:26:51.246
You know... The last three films
you've done were shit, Mick.

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:54.625
I'm telling you, according to me
and according to everybody ...

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:58.212
- They were real shit!
- How dare you?

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:02.007
How dare you?

01:27:05.136 --> 01:27:09.014
So you want to be frank? Do you?

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:12.267
53 years ago, if it weren't for me ...

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:15.229
... You'd still been crouching
under sub-producers desks.

01:27:15.271 --> 01:27:20.359
I pulled you out from under
those big fat producers underpants ...

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:22.486
... I made you an actress.

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:28.283
You little shit.

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:32.913
I was just fine inside those
producers underpants.

01:27:33.539 --> 01:27:38.001
You know why?
Because I wanted to be there.

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:42.798
I don't owe anybody anything.
I did it myself.

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:45.050
- Really?
- I paid my dues.

01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:47.928
I've gotten into the Actor's Studio
and nobody pulled any strings for me.

01:27:48.054 --> 01:27:51.306
I supported myself washing
toilets all over Brooklyn.

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:53.642
My mother went into debt for me.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:57.020
And in Hollywood ...

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:01.149
... When I walked through
that front door ...

01:28:01.192 --> 01:28:03.902
... I was all by my fucking self.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.320
Marilyn ...

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:08.949
... Rita, Grace they'd all shit their pants
when they saw me coming.

01:28:09.158 --> 01:28:12.703
It's all written down in my autobiography.
Don't tell me you haven't read it?

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:17.332
Unfortunately I have.
Except you didn't write it.

01:28:18.334 --> 01:28:22.337
- And it's a piece of shit.
- The real shit is your film, Mick.

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:25.465
I understand cinema, you know I do.

01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:27.551
You're the one who doesn't
understand it any more.

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:30.554
Because you're old, you're tired ...

01:28:30.596 --> 01:28:32.723
You don't know how
to see the world any more, Mick.

01:28:33.057 --> 01:28:38.186
All you know how to see is your own death,
which is waiting right around the corner for you.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.731
Your career is over.

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:44.109
I'm just telling you flat out
because I love you.

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:47.863
Nobody is interested
in this ...

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:50.365
"Testament" of yours?
Is that what you call it? A "Testament"?

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.618
And you'll risk nullyfiyng all the
beautiful films you have ever done.

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:56.121
Which is unforgivable, Mick.

01:28:57.206 --> 01:28:59.750
It's only because of me
they letting you do this movie.

01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:03.503
So, If I pull out,
I'm saving your life ...

01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:06.715
And your dignity!

01:29:08.634 --> 01:29:10.719
You are ingrate.

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:15.223
An ingrate and an idiot.

01:29:15.641 --> 01:29:18.018
Which is why you've got ahead.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:28.403
You're right, Mick.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:32.783
You're exactly right.

01:29:46.005 --> 01:29:47.756
Okay.

01:29:49.425 --> 01:29:53.428
- I'm going to make this movie without you.
- Oh, come on, Mick ...

01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:56.390
Life goes on!

01:29:56.432 --> 01:29:59.267
Even without all that
cinema bullshit!

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:43.103
You know how many actresses
I worked with in my career?

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.565
... Lots, I guess.

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:48.358
More than 50.

01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:52.237
I launched more than 50 actresses.

01:30:54.365 --> 01:30:57.451
And they've always been grateful to me.

01:31:01.372 --> 01:31:03.999
I'm a great women's director.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.835
"That way, Frank ..."

01:31:08.212 --> 01:31:10.755
"That way you'll never forget me."

01:31:13.009 --> 01:31:16.511
- Do you remember, Mr. Boyle?
- Sure, I remember.

01:31:17.763 --> 01:31:21.016
I remember everything
I ever shot.

01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:26.980
Mr. Boyle you're not a great
women's director.

01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:31.026
You're a great director.

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:33.904
Period.

01:32:00.389 --> 01:32:03.308
Okay, I've made up my mind.

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:07.896
I went to the ATM.

01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:14.069
And what do you want to do?

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.949
Go for a walk.

01:32:53.484 --> 01:32:56.444
Would you like to try climbing?

01:32:56.737 --> 01:33:00.490
You know, I can make a man
go wild in bed if I want.

01:33:05.871 --> 01:33:08.957
Come on kids,
What's with the long faces?

01:33:09.208 --> 01:33:11.501
Hitches, the lease,
the shooting ...

01:33:11.627 --> 01:33:14.504
There are constants in our line of work.
Get used to it!

01:33:14.630 --> 01:33:16.506
I've already talked to the producer.

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:20.844
Just the question of coming up with
another actress and the shooting starts.

01:33:21.387 --> 01:33:23.888
Just a matter of waiting
a few more months.

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:26.641
What a bitch that Brenda Morel is!

01:33:27.518 --> 01:33:30.228
Don't talk like that about Brenda Morel.

01:33:30.396 --> 01:33:34.149
- Goes where the wind blows.
- Which is what we all do.

01:33:35.526 --> 01:33:37.611
And that's what you all will do ...

01:33:38.779 --> 01:33:41.740
... In order to survive in this jungle.

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:46.870
It's not true ...

01:33:47.496 --> 01:33:51.791
... That she came to Europe especially
to meet with you, Mick.

01:33:52.168 --> 01:33:54.669
I read that she's
going to Cannes to some...

01:33:55.546 --> 01:33:57.922
... Charity ball at the film festival.

01:33:58.424 --> 01:34:02.052
Now let's not get caught up
in all this truth now.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:07.140
Remember that fiction
is our passion.

01:34:08.059 --> 01:34:12.312
Your film Testament is worth a whole lot more
than one more TV series, Mick.

01:34:12.438 --> 01:34:14.814
My film Testament?

01:34:15.274 --> 01:34:19.194
Let's... Let's be rational here.
Let's not over-read things.

01:34:20.571 --> 01:34:23.323
Most of the men done
not only without the Testament...

01:34:23.449 --> 01:34:25.200
... But without anyone
even noticing.

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:30.038
- Many men are not great artists
like you. - It doesn't make any difference!

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:32.832
Men, artists, animals, plants ...

01:34:39.715 --> 01:34:42.342
We all just extras.

01:35:13.624 --> 01:35:15.750
Mick!

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:18.753
How am I supposed to say
this line, Mick?

01:35:19.004 --> 01:35:20.588
I don't get it.

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:22.757
How do you want it, Mick?

01:35:22.967 --> 01:35:25.135
Sincere or smug, wicked?

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:28.513
And my walk? How is my
character supposed to move?

01:35:34.645 --> 01:35:36.521
Perhaps you do not know, James ...

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:40.650
... That I never even stepped foot
on a yacht that is less than 20 feet.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:44.279
My guys, where did you hide my
lilac slippers?

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:46.406
Enough already!

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:49.117
Prince, I am the owner of six castles
and twenty carriages.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.120
But there is only one thing
I can declare with certainty:

01:35:52.288 --> 01:35:54.622
Life is so tiresome.

01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:59.419
If you suffer from a psychiatric pain ...

01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:03.548
... being a police officer in L.A.
is a real drag.

01:36:06.802 --> 01:36:08.261
Oh, Albert ...

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:12.640
If only you knew how much it has costed
me to guard my virginity ...

01:36:12.683 --> 01:36:16.060
... All these years ...
Until today.

01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:18.772
Until I met you!

01:36:19.565 --> 01:36:22.192
Psi-gamma reactor is malfunctioning.

01:36:22.318 --> 01:36:26.696
Earth will explode in 5, 4, 3 ...

01:36:26.906 --> 01:36:28.656
2, 1 ...

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:32.410
Okay, you win ...

01:36:32.536 --> 01:36:34.078
... I'll go to bed with you ...

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.207
... On one condition.

01:36:37.333 --> 01:36:39.918
That you don't come.

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:42.086
That way, Frank ...

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:47.550
- That way you'll never forget me.
- Where did you hide my lilac slippers?

01:37:51.657 --> 01:37:54.659
So you... spoked to the producer?

01:37:55.786 --> 01:37:59.622
II've been in this business too long
not to know that without Brenda ...

01:37:59.665 --> 01:38:01.666
... This film is never going to be made.

01:38:08.757 --> 01:38:10.925
Melanie is so beautiful in that picture.

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:12.802
You are right.

01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:15.138
She is beautiful.

01:38:17.933 --> 01:38:21.185
You know, I've come to understand
something Fred.

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.939
The people are either
beautiful or ugly.

01:38:25.274 --> 01:38:28.192
The ones in-between are merely cute.

01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:34.532
So... Another vacation almost over.

01:38:38.203 --> 01:38:39.704
What will you do next, Fred?

01:38:39.955 --> 01:38:42.081
What am I supposed to do!

01:38:42.833 --> 01:38:44.709
I'll go home.

01:38:44.835 --> 01:38:47.045
The usual routine.

01:38:48.714 --> 01:38:50.298
Not me.

01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:55.219
I don't do routine.

01:38:57.723 --> 01:38:59.849
I know what I am going to do, Fred?

01:39:02.561 --> 01:39:05.730
I'm going to start another film.

01:39:07.816 --> 01:39:10.818
You say that emotions
are overrated.

01:39:11.862 --> 01:39:14.238
But that's bullshit.

01:39:15.741 --> 01:39:18.743
Emotions are all
what we've got.

01:40:13.632 --> 01:40:17.260
No! Leave me!

01:40:22.933 --> 01:40:25.309
I have to get off this plane!

01:40:25.436 --> 01:40:29.939
- Mick! Forgive me!
- Please, ma'am!

01:40:30.816 --> 01:40:33.526
You fucking bitch,
You let me off!

01:41:10.689 --> 01:41:13.733
I know I should not land here.

01:41:18.447 --> 01:41:22.617
Mick Boyle used to come by
pretty often for a chat.

01:41:22.701 --> 01:41:25.870
Why did you called me, Doctor?
Did you want to tell me something?

01:41:25.996 --> 01:41:30.124
I have the results of all the check-ups
you've been doing during your holidays.

01:41:30.375 --> 01:41:32.210
And what did they say?

01:41:32.377 --> 01:41:35.588
You're as healthy as a horse,
Mr. Ballinger.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.261
My ... prostate at least?

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:44.263
Your  prostate?

01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:48.893
You've never had a problem
with your prostate.

01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:52.396
And if you haven't had
any problems so far ...

01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:55.900
You certainly not going to start
having them now.

01:41:58.529 --> 01:42:00.113
So ...

01:42:00.155 --> 01:42:05.493
I've grown old without understanding
how I got here.

01:42:07.037 --> 01:42:09.664
Do you know what
awaits you outside of here?

01:42:11.416 --> 01:42:12.917
No. What?

01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:15.545
Youth.

01:42:29.893 --> 01:42:31.561
Anyway...

01:42:34.565 --> 01:42:38.192
Did he ever say anything
about Gilda Black?

01:42:38.318 --> 01:42:40.695
He never talked about
anything else.

01:42:43.073 --> 01:42:45.283
Was she his girlfriend?

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.579
Girlfriend is ... way to much.

01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:54.458
The only thing that ever happened
was one time ...

01:42:55.210 --> 01:42:57.211
... When they were kids ...

01:42:58.213 --> 01:43:02.341
... They held hands and
walked together for a few yards ...

01:43:02.467 --> 01:43:04.177
... In some park.

01:43:05.971 --> 01:43:07.597
He used to call it:

01:43:07.723 --> 01:43:10.933
"The moment I learned
to ride a bike. "

01:43:14.104 --> 01:43:17.982
- Didn't he ever tell you about it?
- No.

01:43:20.736 --> 01:43:23.112
We only ever told each other ...

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:25.865
... The good things.

01:44:11.036 --> 01:44:13.412
Fuck!

01:44:57.708 --> 01:44:59.667
I waited till the...

01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:03.838
... Visiting hours
to come and see you.

01:45:08.343 --> 01:45:10.469
They don't know, Melanie.

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:14.724
Children, don't know
their parents ordeals.

01:45:15.684 --> 01:45:20.229
Sure, they know certain details,
striking elements.

01:45:20.939 --> 01:45:23.065
And they know
what they need to know ...

01:45:23.358 --> 01:45:26.610
... To be on one side or the other.

01:45:29.072 --> 01:45:32.825
They don't know that I trembled ...

01:45:33.577 --> 01:45:37.747
... The first time
I ever saw you on stage.

01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:43.753
All the orchestra behind my back
were laughing at my falling in love.

01:45:43.879 --> 01:45:46.505
And my unexpected fragility.

01:45:49.092 --> 01:45:53.137
They don't know that you sold
of your mother's jewellery ...

01:45:53.263 --> 01:45:56.140
... In order to help me
with my second piece ...

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:59.352
... When everyone else
was turning me down ...

01:45:59.394 --> 01:46:04.273
... Calling me "presumptuous",
"inelegant" musician.

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:08.152
They don't know...

01:46:08.403 --> 01:46:10.780
... That you too,
and you were right ...

01:46:11.490 --> 01:46:19.038
... That you thought I was a presumptuous,
inelegant musician at that time.

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:23.042
And you cried so hard.

01:46:23.668 --> 01:46:25.544
Not because you sold
you mother's jewellery ...

01:46:25.754 --> 01:46:28.881
... But because you sold
your mother.

01:46:32.928 --> 01:46:36.180
They don't know that
we were together ...

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:38.766
...You and I...

01:46:38.809 --> 01:46:43.938
... Despite all the exhaustion,
and the pain, and hardship.

01:46:47.192 --> 01:46:49.318
Melanie ...

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.822
They must never know ...

01:46:53.532 --> 01:46:55.533
... That you and I ...

01:46:56.034 --> 01:46:58.285
...despite everything...

01:47:00.288 --> 01:47:02.456
... Liked to think of ourselves ...

01:47:03.458 --> 01:47:05.918
... As a simple song.
