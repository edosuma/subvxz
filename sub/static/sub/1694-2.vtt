WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:02.332
To the left we have
our brand-new

00:02.866 --> 00:05.679
Enoch and Margaret Thompson
Pediatric Annex.

00:05.713 --> 00:07.849
- Please.
- Oh!

00:07.883 --> 00:10.756
Her baby's death, it could
easily have been prevented.

00:10.791 --> 00:13.030
Starting soon, I will be
accepting cash directly.

00:13.064 --> 00:14.834
<i>I have a middleman.</i>
<i>He'll be in touch.</i>

00:14.868 --> 00:16.335
We got company.

00:16.370 --> 00:19.478
You don't tell me when
the boss comes around?

00:21.182 --> 00:22.949
You and me, we had
our little fracas.

00:22.983 --> 00:25.086
Got off on the wombly
foot is all.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.057
- But we copacetic now.
- Sweet as Cracker Jack.

00:28.091 --> 00:29.827
Everything you do
is because I paid for it.

00:29.861 --> 00:31.997
Don't pretend you don't enjoy
playing the benefactor.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.134
You made me a benefactor
by giving that land away.

00:34.168 --> 00:38.138
I'm Lillian Kent,
but you can call me Billie.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.642
Already New Year's back home.

00:40.676 --> 00:43.113
Give my best to Katy.

00:44.517 --> 00:46.586
I want to welcome
Samuel to our table.

00:46.620 --> 00:49.791
Thank you, Mrs. White
and Mr. White.

00:49.826 --> 00:52.495
Effective immediately,
I'll be exporting exclusively

00:52.529 --> 00:53.529
<i>to Mr. Rothstein.</i>

00:53.565 --> 00:55.667
This is a business
decision, Mr. Rosetti.

00:55.702 --> 00:57.736
I need 500 cases of rum.

00:57.771 --> 01:00.608
You're making
my decision very easy.

01:00.642 --> 01:02.010
You'll plead guilty.

01:02.044 --> 01:04.914
<i>You'll do two years at the most.</i>

04:05.833 --> 04:08.566
How, big chief.
Which way to the Little Big Horn?

04:08.601 --> 04:11.596
He sends you?

04:11.630 --> 04:13.996
Sharp as ever.
No luggage, right?

04:25.373 --> 04:26.894
Very rustic here.

04:26.928 --> 04:29.251
They ever let you out?

04:29.285 --> 04:31.408
Fresh air?

04:33.827 --> 04:37.412
Okay, long ride. Don't want
to cover everything at once.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.537
I can't drive if we hold hands.

04:43.571 --> 04:45.628
Let me ask you
something, Mickey.

04:47.191 --> 04:50.705
How the fuck
are you still alive?

04:50.739 --> 04:53.424
'Cause I'm valuable.
I bring people together.

04:53.458 --> 04:54.953
They appreciate that.

04:54.987 --> 04:56.977
You're a backstabbing shit.

04:57.012 --> 04:58.601
No wonder we get along.

05:00.326 --> 05:02.949
Look, Eli, things have changed.

05:02.984 --> 05:06.964
Nucky... hard man
to get to these days.

05:07.032 --> 05:09.222
Can't just walk in
and put your feet up.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.574
A lot of hoops.

05:11.608 --> 05:15.822
And the Munya thing...
that did not help.

05:15.856 --> 05:17.579
What thing?

05:17.613 --> 05:20.832
Oh, just someone
shot his face off.

05:20.866 --> 05:23.417
But who?

05:23.452 --> 05:26.604
Why?
Big question mark.

05:28.101 --> 05:30.620
So nobody just walks in.

05:30.654 --> 05:33.806
But he told me,
"Go fetch my brother.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.329
Get him set up."

05:35.364 --> 05:37.654
What the fuck are you
babbling about?

05:37.688 --> 05:39.745
You...

05:39.779 --> 05:41.769
work for me.

05:41.803 --> 05:43.693
Doing what?

05:43.727 --> 05:47.040
Well, that's my decision,
ain't it?

05:50.193 --> 05:52.317
Eli.

05:57.561 --> 06:01.140
Come on, now.
Don't be a jaboney.

06:02.965 --> 06:05.556
What are you gonna do?

06:05.590 --> 06:08.242
There's no one else
coming for you.

06:44.144 --> 06:46.301
Got you some joe.

06:49.388 --> 06:52.702
Hot enough?
'Cause I... no?

06:53.765 --> 06:55.855
Okay, fine.

06:57.619 --> 06:59.609
So what are we doing, boss?

06:59.638 --> 07:01.995
Another night?

07:02.029 --> 07:04.553
Back to New York?

07:04.587 --> 07:06.672
I mean, I'm just asking.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.967
They got nice little
pastries in there, too.

07:33.824 --> 07:36.376
Can't get too much
of a head start, can you?

07:51.688 --> 07:53.715
Help you, sir?

07:55.007 --> 07:56.569
We're here, right?

07:56.637 --> 07:58.160
<i>Tabor Heights.</i>

07:58.194 --> 08:00.880
- Atlantic City is here.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

08:00.915 --> 08:02.875
New York is here.

08:02.909 --> 08:05.401
And this...

08:05.469 --> 08:07.059
That's the ocean.

08:07.093 --> 08:09.917
And one inch equals 10 miles.

08:09.985 --> 08:11.911
The scale.

08:11.945 --> 08:13.741
How's that?

08:13.770 --> 08:16.468
The scale of the map.

08:16.503 --> 08:18.174
That's what it's called?

08:18.209 --> 08:19.744
Usually.

08:19.781 --> 08:21.956
Sometimes it's not called that?

08:23.195 --> 08:26.365
No, pretty much
always the scale.

08:30.237 --> 08:31.772
A lot of traffic.

08:31.806 --> 08:34.140
Yeah, the truck route to New York.

08:34.174 --> 08:36.342
It's almost seven inches.

08:36.378 --> 08:38.080
Huh?

08:38.114 --> 08:39.551
Oh, right.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.187
Good business?

08:41.222 --> 08:43.089
Till they finish
that new highway,

08:43.123 --> 08:45.057
we're the last gas
till Staten Island.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.127
What's he got in there?

08:49.162 --> 08:50.829
- The truck?
- Yeah.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.098
I... fish?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.500
Says fish.
Could be something else.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.970
That come off the ocean, right?

08:58.004 --> 09:00.039
I wouldn't have
a clue about that.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.874
Who would?

09:01.908 --> 09:03.709
Sorry?

09:05.746 --> 09:09.149
Who would have a clue?

09:11.319 --> 09:12.853
The sheriff, maybe?

09:12.887 --> 09:14.555
He keeps an eye on things.

09:14.589 --> 09:16.991
Sheriff.

09:17.025 --> 09:20.262
He's what, on a horse
or something?

09:20.296 --> 09:22.664
No, he's got a Chevrolet.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.268
I'm supposed to pump gas.

09:30.306 --> 09:32.607
- Hey.
- Sir?

09:32.641 --> 09:36.512
What's a decent place
for chow around here?

09:38.248 --> 09:41.283
Blood pouring out of her.

09:41.318 --> 09:44.419
- Really?
- And she staring right at me,

09:44.420 --> 09:45.720
close as you are now.

09:45.721 --> 09:47.522
I didn't know what to do.

09:47.556 --> 09:48.723
What could you do?

09:48.758 --> 09:50.325
At least she was in
the hospital.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.128
- Yes.
- <i>If that has to happen.</i>

09:53.162 --> 09:54.897
Did she try and take
care of it herself?

09:54.931 --> 09:56.965
- I mean, you hear about...
- It wasn't that.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.568
It was an infection
from raw milk.

09:59.603 --> 10:01.603
- My God.
- She didn't know.

10:01.638 --> 10:04.205
She didn't know
the first thing about it.

10:07.176 --> 10:08.777
It's pasteurized.

10:10.412 --> 10:12.647
The Irish fellow, ma'am.

10:13.382 --> 10:15.650
Visitors are announced
by name, Philip.

10:15.684 --> 10:17.751
He's not really
visiting, is he?

10:17.786 --> 10:20.087
<i>Come in, Mr. Sleater.</i>

10:21.556 --> 10:23.857
Thanks.
Ladies.

10:23.892 --> 10:25.393
You know Miss Predock.

10:25.427 --> 10:27.061
You were at the New Year's do.

10:27.129 --> 10:29.297
You don't remember me.

10:29.331 --> 10:31.732
Mr. Sleater's
quite observant.

10:31.767 --> 10:34.969
And Mrs. Thompson aims
to keep me on my toes.

10:38.606 --> 10:40.040
I'm going to freshen up.

10:40.075 --> 10:42.777
- And whenever you're ready, we'll...
- Thank you.

10:49.818 --> 10:51.619
If there was a household
account at the bank,

10:51.620 --> 10:52.687
you'd be spared the trip.

10:52.688 --> 10:54.822
This is how he wants
to manage it.

10:54.823 --> 10:56.591
Will you be speaking
with him today?

10:56.625 --> 10:58.025
I can get him word.

10:58.060 --> 11:01.696
He has the St. Gregory award from
the diocese for our generosity.

11:01.730 --> 11:03.164
The bishop presents it.

11:03.198 --> 11:04.732
Quite the honor.

11:04.799 --> 11:06.867
<i>Can't very well be turned down</i>

11:06.902 --> 11:09.436
and it's awkward
if he doesn't attend.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.339
I can make some excuse,
but they need an answer, so...

11:12.373 --> 11:14.474
I'll see he's told.

11:16.177 --> 11:18.444
Good girl.

11:18.479 --> 11:20.279
- Emily's thriving?
- Well.

11:20.314 --> 11:23.215
- Never as bad as the worst.
- Ah.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.084
So your mom said that, too.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.888
And yourself?

11:28.922 --> 11:31.657
Plenty to keep me occupied.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.626
You're planning for the spring?

11:33.660 --> 11:35.828
The hospital grounds.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.665
I have business
there, actually.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.834
I can give you a lift
if you'd like.

11:41.869 --> 11:45.104
Cornelia's driving me.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.972
All taken care of, then.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.418
<i>Let me go.</i>

11:59.452 --> 12:00.886
<i>Let me go.</i>
<i>It's leaking.</i>

12:00.920 --> 12:03.221
- <i>I don't care.</i>
- <i>Stop it.</i>

12:03.256 --> 12:05.557
- <i>Stop it! I'm ticklish!</i>
- <i>Stay here.</i>

12:05.592 --> 12:07.292
- <i>Stop!</i>
- <i>I'm not doing anything.</i>

12:07.327 --> 12:09.961
- <i>It's gonna overflow.</i>
- <i>I don't care.</i>

12:09.996 --> 12:12.297
- <i>What are you do...?</i>
- <i>Stop.</i>

12:12.365 --> 12:14.399
<i>Fine, fine.</i>

12:20.607 --> 12:23.175
Don't move.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.143
You look like
a White Rock Girl.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.746
That's sweet.
Now make yourself useful

12:27.781 --> 12:29.915
<i>and fetch a dish towel.</i>

12:34.621 --> 12:37.422
You're gonna take this and you're
gonna pour it down the tub.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.958
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.927
You got it?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.936
Hello?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.605
Oh, it's you.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.041
<i>No, I can't right now.</i>

12:55.075 --> 12:57.610
Because I'm pickling
some peppers, silly.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.379
Yeah, I bet you would.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.290
Think she ever gets laid?

13:12.325 --> 13:13.992
Who?

13:14.060 --> 13:16.061
<i>The White Rock Girl.</i>

13:16.095 --> 13:18.463
I'm sure she has her admirers.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.232
Yeah, but think about it.

13:20.266 --> 13:24.236
Those little wings would
get crushed in a second.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.037
Unless...

13:26.072 --> 13:28.072
She likes to be on top.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.909
Maybe she uses them to hover.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.544
It'd be like screwing
a hummingbird.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.048
<i>Screwing a hummingbird.</i>

13:38.317 --> 13:42.186
♪ She flits, she flies ♪

13:42.220 --> 13:44.722
♪ She twirls in the air ♪

13:44.756 --> 13:47.091
♪ My little hummingbird ♪

13:47.126 --> 13:48.927
<i>♪ She's my joy ♪</i>

13:48.961 --> 13:51.263
<i>♪ My laughter ♪</i>

13:51.297 --> 13:55.334

13:55.368 --> 13:58.204
<i>♪ But, Jesus Christ, fellas ♪</i>

13:58.238 --> 14:00.841
♪ She's too small
to fuck. ♪

14:03.444 --> 14:06.279
Hey, you know,
maybe I could have

14:06.314 --> 14:08.749
one of the boys work
that number out for me.

14:08.783 --> 14:12.052
<i>Not so blue, obviously.</i>

14:12.086 --> 14:14.388
<i>Billie Kent,</i>

14:14.422 --> 14:16.357
<i>The Little Hummingbird.</i>

14:16.424 --> 14:19.493
And the gag is,

14:19.528 --> 14:23.330
every time a good-looking
fella gets close to me...

14:26.935 --> 14:29.169
What's got into you?

14:29.203 --> 14:31.238
Hmm?

14:32.907 --> 14:35.976
You're not getting
gloomy, are you, Gus?

14:37.478 --> 14:40.147
Hey, didn't we
just have some fun?

14:47.788 --> 14:50.824
I have to meet a man
at the Hotel Astor.

14:52.093 --> 14:53.927
Very mysterious.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.395
I'll see you later?

14:55.430 --> 14:56.997
Why else am I in New York?

14:57.032 --> 14:58.699
Such a good liar.

14:58.733 --> 15:00.768
And I'm going
to call your landlord.

15:00.802 --> 15:03.537
- Don't.
- You have a flood in here.

15:03.572 --> 15:07.041
I just hate to bother
Mr. Rothstein.

15:07.075 --> 15:10.311
Whereas I love
to bother Mr. Rothstein.

15:10.346 --> 15:12.480
Well, then,

15:12.515 --> 15:16.318
might as well tell him the whole
place could use a coat of paint.

15:29.932 --> 15:32.967
I don't want to interrupt
your work, sir.

15:33.001 --> 15:36.136
What time we open up,
Mr. Purnsley?

15:36.171 --> 15:39.406
<i>Club don't serve a whiskey</i>
<i>before 10:00 PM.</i>

15:39.440 --> 15:42.409
<i>Maybe you come back</i>
<i>around then.</i>

15:42.476 --> 15:44.911
Got that professor
up from Kansas City.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.981
He beat that old girl
something fierce.

15:53.321 --> 15:55.455
How you doing in school,
Master Samuel?

15:57.525 --> 15:59.359
<i>I'm working hard.</i>

15:59.393 --> 16:01.695
Graduate in two
and a half years.

16:01.729 --> 16:04.064
Be a doctor.

16:04.098 --> 16:06.533
<i>Bet your parents must be proud.</i>

16:06.567 --> 16:09.169
They own that boardinghouse
over on Mediterranean

16:09.203 --> 16:11.638
with the nice rooms
for respectable folk.

16:13.074 --> 16:15.809
They have always held you
in high regard.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.713
What you come to say, son?

16:19.780 --> 16:22.849
I think Maybelle is a
wonderful, young woman, sir.

16:22.917 --> 16:25.185
Thank her mama for that.

16:25.219 --> 16:28.621
My feelings for her
are deep and sincere.

16:30.324 --> 16:33.225
I intend to make a place
for myself in this world.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.462
<i>I would like Maybelle</i>
<i>by my side as I do.</i>

16:36.496 --> 16:39.064
You talk to Maybelle
about this?

16:39.099 --> 16:42.934
I thought it most proper
for me to speak to you first.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.907
A doctor, huh?

16:58.084 --> 17:00.251
How 'bout you doctor me?

17:00.286 --> 17:02.453
Is something bothering you?

17:02.488 --> 17:04.623
I don't know.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.892
I ain't no doctor, am I?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.665
I didn't bring
any of my instruments.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.434
But if you'll allow me...

17:16.803 --> 17:19.104
I find it easier to measure
the pulse here.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.687
Breathe.

17:42.963 --> 17:44.964
Okay.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.966
Open your mouth for me, please.

17:48.001 --> 17:49.968
Ahh.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.304
Ahh.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.574
May I have your hands, sir?

18:00.579 --> 18:03.047
You have a mineral deficiency.

18:04.716 --> 18:07.318
These white spots on the nails.

18:07.352 --> 18:09.420
Is it bad?

18:09.454 --> 18:12.222
You might eat more
leafy vegetables.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.926
Go in the back and tell Augusta

18:14.960 --> 18:17.762
<i>to fix up</i>
<i>a big plate of greens.</i>

18:22.568 --> 18:24.502
Am I suitable,
Mr. White?

18:27.506 --> 18:30.608
Welcome to the family, son.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.461
<i>Mrs. Shearer?</i>

18:49.495 --> 18:51.596
<i>I'm sure you don't remember me.</i>

18:51.664 --> 18:53.765
I'm Margaret Thompson.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.268
I was visiting here when you...

18:56.302 --> 18:58.236
had your difficulty.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.407
I lost a little one.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.910
Yes, I'm sorry.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.544
How are you feeling now?

19:06.578 --> 19:10.982
Well, I can't be lazing about
in bed days on end.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.384
You lost quite a lot of blood.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.185
You're a nurse?

19:15.220 --> 19:18.021
I'm with a group that's
trying to find better ways

19:18.056 --> 19:20.490
for the hospital to look
after our patients.

19:20.525 --> 19:22.292
I don't have complaints.

19:22.326 --> 19:24.394
All the sisters
were nice mostly.

19:24.428 --> 19:26.563
And Dr. Cheever?

19:26.597 --> 19:29.600
<i>Did he offer any advice</i>

19:29.634 --> 19:32.803
about how to tend
to yourself in future?

19:32.838 --> 19:34.238
I don't need him telling me,

19:34.273 --> 19:36.975
not after bringing nine
into this world.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.512
Five that lived.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.917
I have two of my own,
a son and daughter.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.952
Mr. Shearer was set
on another boy

19:47.986 --> 19:50.521
after three girls in a row.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.092
What does your husband do?

19:54.126 --> 19:57.695
We'll pay the bill, ma'am.
I promise you that.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.363
That's not why I asked.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.365
<i>Then why do you need to know?</i>

20:01.399 --> 20:04.968
I'm simply trying to get a sense
of what your life is like.

20:05.002 --> 20:06.703
Well, no disrespect,

20:06.738 --> 20:10.674
but I don't see that being
any business of yours.

20:20.184 --> 20:22.318
Hello?

20:28.693 --> 20:30.795
Hello?

20:47.180 --> 20:49.615
<i>In the bowl.</i>

20:49.649 --> 20:53.152
<i>Just put the money in the bowl.</i>

21:00.495 --> 21:02.429
I'm not doing that.

21:02.463 --> 21:05.231
<i>I'd appreciate it if you did.</i>

21:12.672 --> 21:15.974
$40,000 and I don't know
who I'm giving it to?

21:16.008 --> 21:19.477
Man: <i>It's the entire essence</i>
<i>of the system.</i>

21:19.545 --> 21:21.679
I'm leaving.

21:38.898 --> 21:42.000
Forgive my informal appearance.

21:42.034 --> 21:45.103
It is unconscionably
warm in here.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.839
You are?

21:46.873 --> 21:50.176
<i>My general preference</i>
<i>is to remain anonymous.</i>

21:50.210 --> 21:53.446
But... Gaston Bullock Means.

21:53.481 --> 21:57.150
Special Investigator, United
States Department of Justice.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.754
Where is Jess Smith?

22:00.789 --> 22:04.692
Jess Smith is
conspicuously absent.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.327
How is that an answer?

22:07.362 --> 22:09.462
The client enters.

22:09.497 --> 22:11.664
The payment is placed
in the bowl.

22:11.699 --> 22:14.600
The client leaves.
Who has seen whom?

22:14.634 --> 22:16.902
No one has seen anybody.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.672
And the Republic
survives another day.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.374
This is your idea?

22:22.408 --> 22:26.712
<i>It has the twin virtues</i>
<i>of simplicity and mystery.</i>

22:26.746 --> 22:28.714
It strikes me as idiotic.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.983
<i>Well, that is your prerogative.</i>

22:31.017 --> 22:34.687
Mr. Thompson, did you not
make prior arrangements

22:34.721 --> 22:37.356
with Messrs. Smith
and Daugherty in regards

22:37.391 --> 22:40.292
to certain services
and protections?

22:41.662 --> 22:44.163
<i>And were you not given</i>
<i>exact instructions</i>

22:44.197 --> 22:48.033
<i>as to where and when this</i>
<i>transaction would take place?</i>

22:48.068 --> 22:49.635
I was.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.204
And are we not now both

22:52.239 --> 22:55.674
growing older on
a brisk winter's day

22:55.709 --> 22:58.110
in the great port of New York,

22:58.145 --> 23:02.548
eager to see where
fate leads us next?

23:12.060 --> 23:14.662
What is going on
with Smith and Daugherty?

23:16.398 --> 23:20.635
My understanding is that they
are no more than close friends,

23:20.670 --> 23:23.072
base rumors to the contrary.

23:24.775 --> 23:26.509
That's not what I meant.

23:26.543 --> 23:29.378
I know what you meant.

23:29.412 --> 23:33.482
But that would be
another conversation

23:33.517 --> 23:35.151
in a different room.

23:35.185 --> 23:37.920
What would that cost?

23:39.490 --> 23:42.258
How would you judge
a man you could buy

23:42.292 --> 23:44.627
within five minutes
of meeting him?

23:44.695 --> 23:47.030
I wouldn't trust him
for a second.

23:47.064 --> 23:50.066
Well, then, we are face to face

23:50.101 --> 23:52.169
with paradox.

23:58.677 --> 24:01.879
Consider me an admirer,
Mr. Thompson.

24:01.913 --> 24:04.148
Ordinary men avoid trouble.

24:04.183 --> 24:08.452
Extraordinary men turn it
to their advantage.

24:08.487 --> 24:11.055
You and I have that in common.

24:21.033 --> 24:22.967
<i>Hello?</i>

24:27.606 --> 24:29.706
<i>Hello?</i>

24:49.192 --> 24:51.027
Would you do me the favor

24:51.061 --> 24:53.997
of waiting till
Mr. Remus leaves

24:54.031 --> 24:56.332
and then exit by that door?

24:56.367 --> 24:58.568
Thank you.

24:58.602 --> 25:01.204
Oh, and regards
to Mr. Rothstein.

25:01.239 --> 25:03.574
I believe you're
seeing him later.

25:07.912 --> 25:10.414
Come in.

25:13.619 --> 25:15.153
Am I interrupting?

25:15.187 --> 25:17.656
Why would I say
"come in" if you were?

25:26.299 --> 25:29.401
You tried to tell me
something the other day.

25:29.435 --> 25:31.803
I'm afraid I wasn't
very receptive.

25:31.837 --> 25:33.071
And?

25:33.106 --> 25:36.208
And it's been bothering me.

25:36.242 --> 25:38.243
I've looked in
on Mrs. Shearer.

25:38.277 --> 25:40.946
The E. Coli case.

25:40.980 --> 25:44.249
Yes, the E. Coli case.

25:45.217 --> 25:47.485
What's your impression?

25:47.553 --> 25:49.821
She's rather a difficult
person, frankly.

25:49.855 --> 25:52.823
Perhaps she's wary
of well-meaning strangers.

25:52.858 --> 25:56.494
Have I done something
to offend you?

25:56.529 --> 25:58.529
Why do you ask?

25:58.564 --> 26:01.032
You just might find it
useful to be a bit warmer.

26:01.066 --> 26:02.233
Because you're on the board?

26:02.267 --> 26:04.435
<i>I meant with people in general.</i>

26:04.503 --> 26:06.638
How do you know how I am
with people in general?

26:06.672 --> 26:08.940
Let's say I'm forming
an impression.

26:08.974 --> 26:10.675
Perhaps your perception

26:10.709 --> 26:12.944
regarding
my supposed brusqueness

26:12.978 --> 26:14.546
comes out of a sense
of frustration.

26:14.580 --> 26:17.081
Whose?
Mine?

26:17.116 --> 26:19.317
- I'm frustrated?
- Are you?

26:19.351 --> 26:21.219
You have a maddening way.

26:21.253 --> 26:24.488
Perhaps it has something to do with the
care we offer women like Mrs. Shearer.

26:24.522 --> 26:26.423
- Or don't.
- You're doing it again.

26:26.458 --> 26:28.559
- <i>Doing what?</i>
- Blaming me for something.

26:28.593 --> 26:29.994
What would I be
blaming you for?

26:30.028 --> 26:32.063
I haven't the slightest idea.

26:32.097 --> 26:34.398
Then I'm really not sure
what this conversation is about.

26:50.549 --> 26:52.784
You gave me quite a severe
lecture the other day

26:52.818 --> 26:55.753
and I'm here to see if there's
something I might do about it.

26:55.787 --> 26:57.605
I don't know what cause
you have to resent me.

26:57.606 --> 26:58.623
I don't have any...

26:58.657 --> 27:00.324
Although I'm fairly
certain it has to do

27:00.359 --> 27:02.827
with your assumption that I am
rich, spoiled, and indifferent.

27:02.861 --> 27:04.596
- You...
- <i>I'm not finished.</i>

27:04.630 --> 27:08.466
If you have a proposal for helping
the women who come to this hospital,

27:08.500 --> 27:11.836
instead of simply a bad habit
of flinging pointed barbs

27:11.870 --> 27:14.772
at people you dislike and
feeling pleased with yourself,

27:14.806 --> 27:16.841
then I would very much
like to hear it.

27:19.945 --> 27:22.112
It's a Catholic hospital.

27:22.147 --> 27:25.549
You knew that when you
spoke to me last time.

27:26.885 --> 27:29.053
How do you propose
to persuade Dr. Landau?

27:29.087 --> 27:32.189
I don't propose
to persuade him at all.

27:32.224 --> 27:35.092
- <i>May I ask exactly what...</i>
- You may not.

27:35.994 --> 27:37.661
Anything else?

27:37.696 --> 27:40.731
Yes. Please refrain
from smoking that pipe

27:40.766 --> 27:42.099
or buy better tobacco.

27:42.134 --> 27:44.568
Whatever you stuff
in there is appalling.

27:46.738 --> 27:48.940
We filled up.
What are we hanging around for?

27:48.974 --> 27:50.842
I run a tight operation, Eli.

27:50.876 --> 27:54.145
I don't need any guff from
the fellas that work for me.

27:54.213 --> 27:56.281
I don't work for you.

27:57.584 --> 27:59.785
I hear there are
opportunities out west.

27:59.819 --> 28:02.121
Hop a rail.
Godspeed.

28:02.155 --> 28:03.389
Look,

28:03.423 --> 28:06.792
<i>I just want to go home,</i>
<i>see June and the kids.</i>

28:06.826 --> 28:09.294
That you will,
after we do this.

28:09.328 --> 28:12.930
You kept me waiting, Victor.

28:14.866 --> 28:16.834
I have a town to patrol.

28:16.868 --> 28:20.070
Those Methodists
keeping you up at night?

28:20.138 --> 28:23.140
I find trouble around here
comes from the outside.

28:23.175 --> 28:25.443
Well, we got a convoy
coming through tomorrow night.

28:25.477 --> 28:27.445
We don't want
no trouble neither.

28:29.982 --> 28:31.783
The other half?

28:31.818 --> 28:35.020
With the convoy,
same as always.

28:35.054 --> 28:36.855
You know Nucky's good for it.

28:36.890 --> 28:39.025
Tank yourselves up
and head on through.

28:39.059 --> 28:41.694
I don't want to see any of
your boys lounge around Main,

28:41.728 --> 28:43.662
near the beaches,
or the coast road.

28:43.697 --> 28:45.064
You head on through.

28:45.098 --> 28:48.433
What if they need to pray?

28:49.935 --> 28:51.502
Something on your mind?

28:51.537 --> 28:53.971
You don't remember me?

28:54.006 --> 28:56.173
You were up and down
this shore 10 years ago

28:56.208 --> 28:58.742
looking for any job
with a badge.

28:59.911 --> 29:02.846
Well, I found one.

29:04.348 --> 29:06.917
Tomorrow night,
fill up your trucks

29:06.951 --> 29:08.585
and move on through.

29:12.890 --> 29:16.793
You take care now,
Sheriff Thompson.

29:21.466 --> 29:23.234
What was it like?

29:23.268 --> 29:25.103
Just a little roadhouse
off campus.

29:25.137 --> 29:26.971
And you played piano there?

29:27.005 --> 29:29.908
It's not so much a piano as it
is a packing crate with keys,

29:29.975 --> 29:31.376
but yes.

29:31.410 --> 29:33.878
And you do that King and
Carter number, don't you?

29:33.912 --> 29:36.748
Maybelle Anne,
jazz is the devil's music.

29:36.782 --> 29:39.884
And no self-respecting negro
would go near it.

29:46.026 --> 29:47.826
Oh, Father.

29:47.861 --> 29:49.895
Are we called to dinner?

29:49.929 --> 29:52.465
Lester, I need
to talk to your sister.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.266
Go down and help set up.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.268
Yes, sir.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.606
I'll give you those
Claude McKay poems.

30:00.641 --> 30:02.876
- They're worth a look.
- Okay.

30:11.219 --> 30:13.354
Your beau came to see me today.

30:13.388 --> 30:15.657
I know.

30:15.691 --> 30:18.226
He called here afterwards.

30:18.260 --> 30:20.862
Your mom ain't saying nothing.

30:20.896 --> 30:22.931
<i>I haven't told her.</i>

30:25.068 --> 30:28.603
Samuel's awful sweet, isn't he?

30:28.638 --> 30:30.539
Very respectful.

30:33.609 --> 30:35.844
He's going to be a good doctor.

30:37.180 --> 30:39.114
Good husband, too.

30:40.550 --> 30:43.418
How old were you
when you married Mama?

30:47.323 --> 30:49.491
Going on 26.

30:49.525 --> 30:51.960
And when you saw her,

30:51.995 --> 30:53.896
you knew.

30:53.930 --> 30:56.732
<i>I knew she wouldn't</i>
<i>give me the time of day.</i>

30:56.767 --> 30:59.201
I knew her daddy
tell everybody he meet

30:59.236 --> 31:02.671
that I be half Apache
and such and a no-account

31:02.705 --> 31:05.107
all 'cause I come up
from Texas,

31:05.142 --> 31:07.510
worked the storefront
for old Oscar Boneau.

31:07.544 --> 31:09.278
What changed Grandpa's mind?

31:10.847 --> 31:13.449
He run into some problems,
so I help him out.

31:13.483 --> 31:16.285
- <i>How?</i>
- Don't matter how.

31:16.319 --> 31:18.053
<i>He see he could count on me.</i>

31:18.088 --> 31:20.055
<i>I be on the side of the family.</i>

31:21.758 --> 31:24.359
Now this man of yours
gonna be a doctor.

31:24.394 --> 31:26.695
That's good for us...

31:26.763 --> 31:28.330
for this family.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.999
- What about me?
- Ain't you part of it?

31:31.033 --> 31:32.868
<i>Daddy, I don't want</i>
<i>to just move</i>

31:32.902 --> 31:35.437
from this house
into someone else's.

31:35.471 --> 31:37.038
It's gonna be your house.

31:37.106 --> 31:38.607
You and husband.

31:38.641 --> 31:40.375
<i>And your little ones.</i>

31:40.409 --> 31:42.043
I'm not ready for that.

31:42.078 --> 31:43.811
Oh, girl, it ain't gonna
happen right away.

31:43.845 --> 31:45.313
<i>I'm never gonna be ready.</i>

31:45.347 --> 31:48.983
Not with Samuel.

31:51.053 --> 31:53.421
Your mama work for this.

31:55.023 --> 31:57.792
Work all her days
to raise you for this.

31:57.826 --> 32:00.461
- She married you.
- What that mean?

32:02.731 --> 32:04.799
You're interesting.

32:06.469 --> 32:08.670
How did you help Grandpa?

32:08.704 --> 32:11.740
I won't tell.

32:11.774 --> 32:13.909
Did you get rid of someone?

32:13.943 --> 32:17.045
Think me and you having
some kind of discussion?

32:17.079 --> 32:19.481
It's my life, Daddy.

32:19.515 --> 32:23.018
And how you
gonna live it? Huh?

32:23.052 --> 32:24.952
What, back seat of a car,

32:24.986 --> 32:28.088
swagger buck with a pistol,
wife two county over?

32:28.123 --> 32:30.057
Why not?

32:30.092 --> 32:31.859
I'll write a poem about it.

32:31.894 --> 32:34.796
<i>Them people can't even</i>
<i>sign they own name.</i>

32:34.831 --> 32:37.665
And your life,
your life belong...

32:37.700 --> 32:39.834
Mama says dinner.

32:45.308 --> 32:47.376
You marrying that boy.

32:54.818 --> 32:56.986
So tomorrow morning,
8:00 sharp.

32:57.021 --> 32:59.690
Big shipment for Rothstein.

32:59.758 --> 33:01.825
Go fuck yourself.

33:04.596 --> 33:06.530
You have a nice night, too.

33:17.577 --> 33:20.144
- Bri?
- Hi, Pop.

33:20.179 --> 33:22.180
Look at you.

33:23.950 --> 33:27.218
- Daddy!
- Oh!

33:27.253 --> 33:29.120
Who are all these beauties

33:29.154 --> 33:32.290
and these handsome young men?

33:32.358 --> 33:34.425
Hey, Edith.

33:37.263 --> 33:38.630
Someone too big for a hug?

33:38.697 --> 33:40.598
Welcome home, Dad.

33:40.633 --> 33:42.467
Where'd you get that grip?

33:42.501 --> 33:45.570
- I don't know.
- He's been working in a lumberyard.

33:45.604 --> 33:47.505
Nobody told me that.

33:47.540 --> 33:50.041
June: <i>You had enough</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

34:10.995 --> 34:13.196
Evening, everybody.

34:14.532 --> 34:16.933
Cold out there, huh?

34:16.967 --> 34:18.935
Miss.

34:21.139 --> 34:22.371
What's good?

34:22.406 --> 34:24.706
Oh, everything.
It's all made here.

34:27.812 --> 34:31.047
Spaghetti and meatballs.

34:31.081 --> 34:33.149
Tell me about that.

34:33.184 --> 34:35.885
It's like a noodle.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.887
Mm-hmm.

34:37.955 --> 34:40.223
And it's covered
in a red sauce.

34:40.257 --> 34:42.659
But you could have it
with butter instead.

34:42.693 --> 34:47.163
And balls of meat like this.

34:47.197 --> 34:50.399
Sounds delicious.
I'll have that.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.434
With the butter or the sauce?

34:52.467 --> 34:54.235
The sauce.

34:54.270 --> 34:56.304
Make it two.

34:56.338 --> 34:58.573
And you know what
I'd like with that?

34:58.607 --> 35:01.008
Just a little wine, hmm?

35:01.043 --> 35:02.943
Oh.

35:02.978 --> 35:05.312
We don't have that.
It's against the law.

35:05.346 --> 35:08.648
Still, in the back,
inside the cupboard...

35:09.650 --> 35:12.051
behind the sody-pop.

35:12.086 --> 35:13.820
<i>You know what's good here?</i>

35:13.854 --> 35:16.256
<i>The coffee.</i>

35:16.290 --> 35:19.159
Brew it fresh
every half-hour.

35:19.193 --> 35:20.927
Best thing
on a night like this.

35:22.964 --> 35:26.099
Okay.
Thank you.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.002
We'll have spaghetti
and coffee.

35:29.036 --> 35:31.304
Keep you nice and warm
on the road.

35:31.339 --> 35:34.340
No driving tonight.

35:34.375 --> 35:36.075
Staying in Tabor Heights?

35:37.577 --> 35:39.445
We're over at
the Kinneret Lodge.

35:39.479 --> 35:41.914
Not much going on here
this time of year.

35:41.948 --> 35:45.685
Asbury Park, Atlantic City,
that's where the action is.

35:45.719 --> 35:47.920
That's 60 miles.

35:47.954 --> 35:50.189
Or you could head
back to New York.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.494
How you know
we're from New York?

35:55.528 --> 35:57.896
Call it a hunch.

36:19.588 --> 36:21.456
Better than Mama's, huh?

36:28.064 --> 36:30.198
What do you know about
this Means fella?

36:30.232 --> 36:33.267
He's a colorful personality.

36:33.302 --> 36:36.036
I don't need to get wrapped up
in Harry Daugherty's mess.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.638
<i>Do you?</i>

36:37.672 --> 36:39.873
The protection is valuable.

36:39.908 --> 36:43.977
The cost is insignificant overall.

36:44.011 --> 36:45.979
They're collecting money
in a fishbowl.

36:46.013 --> 36:48.748
I'd never advise
against caution,

36:48.783 --> 36:52.218
considering the ongoing
volatility in the marketplace.

36:53.887 --> 36:57.490
If you're poking around Manny
Horvitz, why don't you just say so?

36:58.992 --> 37:00.960
Do you have a suspect?

37:00.994 --> 37:03.062
Waxey Gordon comes to mind.

37:03.097 --> 37:05.064
- Naturally.
- But it's not Waxey,

37:05.098 --> 37:07.366
because Waxey would
have to clear it with you,

37:07.400 --> 37:10.235
and you would have said no because
you're in business with me.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.904
That could be what
I want you to think.

37:11.938 --> 37:14.873
It could, but I doubt it.

37:14.908 --> 37:17.342
How can you be sure?

37:17.376 --> 37:19.177
<i>Because if you were</i>
<i>trying to be obvious,</i>

37:19.211 --> 37:21.879
<i>you'd never be that obvious.</i>

37:21.914 --> 37:24.949
This is why I enjoy
our conversations.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.223
But I do hope you're paying
equally close attention

37:32.257 --> 37:34.492
to our arrangement.

37:34.526 --> 37:37.094
There's a shipment
going out tonight.

37:39.598 --> 37:41.699
We agreed on the fourth.

37:41.734 --> 37:43.634
That's tonight.

37:45.804 --> 37:48.706
It's tomorrow, Mr. Thompson.

37:51.176 --> 37:54.077
Of course it is.
My mistake.

37:55.379 --> 37:57.480
Well,

37:57.515 --> 38:01.117
a man's allowed to enjoy
himself every now and then.

38:02.452 --> 38:04.420
I've got people
on top of it, Arnold.

38:04.454 --> 38:06.389
That's why I pay them.

38:06.423 --> 38:08.792
As long as they have calendars.

38:12.263 --> 38:15.466
Your radiators leak.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.002
West 57th Street.

38:19.805 --> 38:21.906
Miss Kent's building.

38:21.941 --> 38:23.174
<i>You own it.</i>

38:23.209 --> 38:26.144
You might want to protect
your investment.

38:26.178 --> 38:28.479
Are you looking to rent?

38:28.547 --> 38:30.816
East of the park
would suit you better.

38:30.884 --> 38:33.318
What are you implying?

38:33.352 --> 38:35.721
She's a charming

38:35.755 --> 38:38.490
and vivacious young woman.

38:54.309 --> 38:56.077
- Prudence.
- <i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

38:56.111 --> 38:58.279
Mr. Thompson has
a morning suit.

38:58.313 --> 39:00.581
The striped trousers
and cutaway jacket.

39:00.616 --> 39:02.317
Do you know where it is?

39:02.351 --> 39:04.219
No, but I'm sure I can find it.

39:04.253 --> 39:06.689
Check that it's sound
and have it cleaned.

39:06.757 --> 39:09.125
He's going to need it
when he meets the bishop.

39:09.159 --> 39:12.395
Oh, did you not
get the message, ma'am?

39:12.429 --> 39:13.896
What message?

39:13.930 --> 39:17.833
Mr. Thompson, he left word that he
won't be attending the ceremony.

39:19.737 --> 39:22.205
Clean the suit anyway.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.541
I'm afraid he's mistaken.

40:14.426 --> 40:15.893
Will.

40:15.927 --> 40:17.795
<i>Hi, Pop.</i>

40:17.829 --> 40:20.964
I was up.
Didn't want to wake your mother.

40:20.999 --> 40:24.568
- What are you doing?
- Going to work.

40:24.602 --> 40:26.570
Nothing for breakfast?

40:26.604 --> 40:28.739
There's coffee
and donuts at the yard.

40:30.442 --> 40:32.376
Not enough for a growing boy.

40:32.411 --> 40:34.946
I'll be okay.

40:37.416 --> 40:39.918
Look, uh....

40:41.220 --> 40:43.722
what you done here

40:43.757 --> 40:46.158
for your mom, brothers,
and sisters...

40:47.494 --> 40:49.495
I'm proud of you.

40:49.562 --> 40:52.264
It's nothing, Pop.

40:52.298 --> 40:54.833
I'm home now.

40:54.867 --> 40:57.002
And I'm gonna, you know,

40:57.036 --> 40:59.971
get back on the horse.

41:00.039 --> 41:02.507
So you don't have
to do this anymore.

41:02.575 --> 41:04.243
I'm pretty used to it.

41:04.277 --> 41:07.412
You should be in school.
You got your mother's brains.

41:07.447 --> 41:08.780
I've been learning plenty.

41:08.814 --> 41:11.516
<i>No, science, math.</i>

41:11.550 --> 41:14.419
Hey.

41:14.453 --> 41:16.721
I read Shakespeare.

41:16.756 --> 41:19.457
Can you beat that?

41:19.492 --> 41:22.327
Thine old pop.

41:26.499 --> 41:30.469
That's the boss.
He picks me up.

41:44.785 --> 41:46.954
Happy two birthdays ago.

41:48.824 --> 41:50.925
Pretty keen.

41:52.494 --> 41:54.362
I got to go, Pop.

42:02.873 --> 42:06.309
Keep it moving, fellas.
Everything ready to go by sundown.

42:08.712 --> 42:10.980
Fit a whole 'nother
row up there.

42:17.955 --> 42:20.189
Big shipment tonight, huh?

42:21.591 --> 42:24.427
Nothing gets past you.

42:24.461 --> 42:26.429
Where's it headed?

42:26.463 --> 42:28.064
Maybe you don't understand
the principle.

42:28.098 --> 42:31.467
We pay you prohees
not to ask questions.

42:31.501 --> 42:33.803
I haven't been paid yet.

42:36.806 --> 42:38.674
You know what's goofy?

42:38.708 --> 42:40.943
Cash business like this,

42:40.977 --> 42:43.478
come the end of the day...

42:45.581 --> 42:47.915
I still got empty pockets.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.595
I found him
hanging around outside.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.269
8:00 AM I said.

43:09.303 --> 43:11.572
I'm here now.

43:28.255 --> 43:29.187
No, but I don't get it.

43:29.356 --> 43:31.691
I'm dressed
as a hummingbird, Vi.

43:31.726 --> 43:33.794
And every time
she gets near a fella...

43:33.828 --> 43:35.395
But how do the wings move?

43:35.430 --> 43:37.464
That is someone else's problem.

43:37.498 --> 43:39.433
But let's say...

43:39.501 --> 43:41.502
let's say I get it into
the Passing Show this year.

43:41.537 --> 43:44.906
You're going to be in that show
and everyone's going to love you,

43:44.940 --> 43:46.875
but what'll happen to me?

43:46.909 --> 43:49.778
- Well, you, maybe...
- Hummingbird's best friend.

43:49.812 --> 43:51.513
Sure!

43:51.547 --> 43:53.582
<i>We could have a whole routine.</i>

43:53.616 --> 43:57.018
They leave the nest and, um...

43:57.053 --> 43:59.821
Wind up in a speak
where they finish off

43:59.855 --> 44:02.991
a whole bottle of nectar
and comedy ensues.

44:03.025 --> 44:05.593
When do we start?

44:05.627 --> 44:07.495
I'll talk to Lee
Shubert tomorrow.

44:07.563 --> 44:09.030
You know Lee Shubert?

44:09.064 --> 44:10.932
- <i>Oh, buzz-buzz, Vi.</i>
- What?

44:10.966 --> 44:14.802
Close your mouth.
Something might fly in.

44:15.938 --> 44:17.706
Right back.

44:17.740 --> 44:21.509
Don't drink
everything without me.

44:21.544 --> 44:23.912
I had walking pneumonia
last summer.

44:23.946 --> 44:25.747
She sat with me every day.

44:25.782 --> 44:27.583
Bought groceries.
Made soup.

44:27.617 --> 44:29.051
So you have to be nice to her.

44:29.085 --> 44:31.687
You have to.

44:31.721 --> 44:34.690
I don't
usually drink stuff this good

44:34.724 --> 44:36.659
because, well, a lot
of the guys, you know,

44:36.693 --> 44:38.961
they dress real slick
and flash a big bankroll,

44:38.995 --> 44:41.196
<i>but, brother,</i>
<i>they watch the meter.</i>

44:41.231 --> 44:43.031
<i>And then you find</i>
<i>yourself at 4:00 AM</i>

44:43.065 --> 44:45.033
<i>in some god-awful</i>
<i>apartment in Yorkville</i>

44:45.068 --> 44:47.102
<i>looking for your stockings.</i>

44:48.872 --> 44:50.906
I wasn't suggesting that you...

44:50.941 --> 44:53.409
Don't concern yourself.

44:53.443 --> 44:56.145
Guess who I just ran into.

44:56.179 --> 44:58.281
<i>His Great Satanic Majesty,</i>

44:58.315 --> 45:01.084
- the Spider of Wall Street.
- No.

45:01.118 --> 45:03.686
Oh, he's not so bad.

45:03.721 --> 45:05.388
That is not what
you said last month.

45:05.423 --> 45:07.324
People change their minds.

45:07.358 --> 45:09.459
I got a letter yesterday
from that vicious,

45:09.494 --> 45:12.629
dried-up bitch in Muncie...
oops, I mean my mother.

45:12.664 --> 45:15.299
Sends me a story
cut out from "Collier's."

45:15.333 --> 45:16.800
<i>Guess what it's called.</i>

45:18.470 --> 45:20.771
- I can't imagine.
- Me neither.

45:20.805 --> 45:23.841
"Sad Nights of a Showgirl."

45:27.078 --> 45:30.113
Why is that funny?

45:31.682 --> 45:33.716
Your attention, please.

45:34.952 --> 45:37.453
Thank you.

45:37.487 --> 45:40.122
This convoy is headed
north for New York City.

45:40.156 --> 45:41.990
We're making exactly two stops.

45:42.025 --> 45:44.893
The first will be the Standard Oil
station in Tabor Heights, New Jersey,

45:44.927 --> 45:46.327
to refill with petrol.

45:46.362 --> 45:48.863
The next will be the Rothmere
Storage Corporation,

45:48.897 --> 45:52.367
62 Imlay Street
in the borough of Brooklyn.

45:52.401 --> 45:54.435
Two men in every cab.
Second man will be armed.

45:54.469 --> 45:58.005
If you're arrested,
you know nothing.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.108
Any questions?

46:03.778 --> 46:05.846
Then those that are done,
line up for your pay.

46:21.896 --> 46:23.764
Back in town.

46:24.966 --> 46:28.402
Turns out they let you go
if you ask polite.

46:29.838 --> 46:32.005
I'll tell Mr. Thompson
you're situated.

46:32.040 --> 46:34.475
You're the golden boy now, huh?

46:34.509 --> 46:37.845
I see things run smoothly, aye.

46:45.420 --> 46:48.055
Extra 50 for the trip
to New York.

46:49.558 --> 46:52.894
I didn't come for a handout.

46:52.928 --> 46:55.263
Suit yourself.

46:55.297 --> 46:58.099
Anyway,

46:58.133 --> 47:00.134
I don't have a piece.

47:42.679 --> 47:44.513
Why don't you drink?

47:45.715 --> 47:47.482
I'm drinking.

47:47.517 --> 47:49.384
I'm having fun.

47:51.754 --> 47:53.688
It's why people come here.

47:55.091 --> 47:56.725
If you don't
want to marry me...

47:56.759 --> 47:59.461
Speak up.
Yell.

47:59.495 --> 48:02.031
Yell. Yell!
Can't you do that?

48:02.065 --> 48:05.067
I said, if you don't want...

48:06.270 --> 48:08.437
if you don't
want to marry me...

48:09.906 --> 48:11.840
then why don't you just
come out and say it?

48:11.875 --> 48:14.977
Pardon me. Can you watch
what you're doing, sir?

48:15.011 --> 48:17.313
You watch this.

48:18.682 --> 48:21.250
Samuel!

48:34.898 --> 48:36.799
<i>Daddy!</i>

48:38.134 --> 48:40.603
Keep playing.

48:40.637 --> 48:43.606
Chalky: <i>What in the hell</i>
<i>you doing here?</i>

48:57.521 --> 48:59.722
You okay to walk?

49:05.195 --> 49:08.264
Then walk.
Take her with you.

49:12.002 --> 49:13.236
That man needs help.

49:13.271 --> 49:16.339
You ain't gonna
be giving it to him.

49:23.814 --> 49:25.816
Look at me, girl.

49:27.318 --> 49:30.621
Look at me!

49:30.656 --> 49:33.658
You interested now?

49:36.762 --> 49:39.096
<i>Am I interesting now?</i>

50:09.694 --> 50:11.361
Pumps are locked.

50:11.396 --> 50:13.664
What are we doing?

50:13.698 --> 50:15.032
You tell me.

50:15.066 --> 50:17.668
Sickles ain't here.
Let's just blow through.

50:17.702 --> 50:20.137
Don't you need gas?

50:20.172 --> 50:21.806
Find it up the line.

50:21.840 --> 50:24.075
I'll not take eight lorries
on an Easter egg hunt

50:24.109 --> 50:26.911
and risk getting
stranded along the way.

50:26.945 --> 50:29.880
Forward or back?
I'm freezing my nuts off.

50:47.334 --> 50:49.468
Probably a key inside.

50:52.372 --> 50:55.542
- That's private property.
- Jesus, Victor, buy a watch already.

50:55.576 --> 50:57.911
- <i>And unlock the pumps.</i>
- What's in those trucks?

50:59.848 --> 51:01.382
Same as always.

51:01.416 --> 51:03.284
Well, if it's liquor,
there's a problem.

51:03.318 --> 51:04.452
Since when?

51:04.486 --> 51:06.521
<i>Since he read the Constitution.</i>

51:08.391 --> 51:11.025
They passed a whole amendment.

51:11.060 --> 51:14.095
What brings you here,
Mr. Rosetti?

51:14.129 --> 51:15.930
Who?

51:15.964 --> 51:19.233
I called you by your name.

51:19.268 --> 51:21.702
<i>I think you got me mixed up.</i>

51:21.737 --> 51:24.639
No, I'm, uh...

51:24.673 --> 51:27.876
D.L. Collingsworth.

51:27.944 --> 51:30.578
Proprietor.

51:30.612 --> 51:32.012
Really?

51:32.047 --> 51:36.183
Yeah, we go way back
around here.

51:36.217 --> 51:39.619
Slept with George Washington
and everything.

51:39.654 --> 51:41.655
Eight trucks, huh?

51:41.689 --> 51:43.423
A lot of gasoline.

51:43.458 --> 51:45.892
So?
We're good for it.

51:45.926 --> 51:48.828
Sure, only thing,

51:48.862 --> 51:51.131
we don't got any.

51:52.566 --> 51:53.767
You've no fuel?

51:53.801 --> 51:56.369
And here it is,
a filling station.

51:59.606 --> 52:01.107
That makes me chuckle.

52:01.141 --> 52:04.777
We'll gas up, we'll pay
you, and we'll drive on.

52:04.811 --> 52:06.912
What's that?

52:08.381 --> 52:10.683
A gun?

52:12.485 --> 52:13.986
I got a gun.

52:16.990 --> 52:19.692
I got a gun,

52:19.726 --> 52:21.961
he got a gun,

52:21.995 --> 52:24.463
he got a gun.

52:25.599 --> 52:27.766
Everybody got guns.

52:39.646 --> 52:42.248
Fellas,

52:42.282 --> 52:44.383
you ain't gonna make
New York tonight.

52:44.418 --> 52:47.253
<i>You're gonna run out of gas.</i>

52:50.790 --> 52:53.325
You think Mr. Thompson
won't hear about this?

52:54.594 --> 52:56.861
What was I supposed to do?

52:56.895 --> 52:59.130
Tell Nucky

52:59.164 --> 53:02.600
old Pop Collingsworth
says hello.

53:04.836 --> 53:06.937
Are you trying
to asphyxiate us?

53:07.005 --> 53:09.339
Here we go.

53:12.510 --> 53:13.911
All in the same pan?

53:13.945 --> 53:16.180
Old hobo trick.
Sit down.

53:38.770 --> 53:40.337
You know how to sling 'em.

53:40.372 --> 53:42.773
Had a lot of practice.

53:42.808 --> 53:43.941
Like fun you did.

53:43.975 --> 53:46.577
Cooked for my brother,
sister, my ma,

53:46.611 --> 53:48.546
just to give her a day off.

53:48.580 --> 53:49.981
Watched them eat.

53:50.015 --> 53:52.484
Made sure they'd finish
every scrap.

53:53.586 --> 53:55.154
What about you?

53:55.188 --> 53:57.990
Well, see, I'd only
steal enough for three.

53:59.460 --> 54:01.027
Wasn't Chaplin in that one?

54:03.898 --> 54:05.933
Don't.

54:17.345 --> 54:21.014
Know what I'd like
more than anything else?

54:22.350 --> 54:23.951
What?

54:23.985 --> 54:27.588
For people to be honest
about what they want,

54:27.622 --> 54:29.290
no matter what.

54:30.525 --> 54:33.794
Sounds a little dangerous.

54:33.862 --> 54:36.497
It's dangerous anyway.

54:39.534 --> 54:41.302
I'll bite.

54:41.336 --> 54:44.405
What do you want?

54:47.041 --> 54:50.844
I want

54:50.878 --> 54:53.112
everything to run

54:53.146 --> 54:55.714
all by itself.

54:55.749 --> 54:58.317
Then what would you do?

54:58.351 --> 55:00.753
Stay here.

55:00.787 --> 55:02.588
Forever...

55:04.790 --> 55:06.858
if I could.

55:09.428 --> 55:11.529
Oh, Gus.

55:15.201 --> 55:17.568
You know you can't.

55:28.147 --> 55:31.116
Who's calling?

55:31.150 --> 55:33.619
I said I'd never tell.

55:37.892 --> 55:40.260
And you said you'd never ask.

56:14.931 --> 56:17.000
You reach him?

56:18.369 --> 56:21.071
So, now what?

56:23.741 --> 56:26.476
How many would you
say back there?

56:26.511 --> 56:29.146
I counted 12.

56:29.180 --> 56:31.115
Maybe more.

56:31.149 --> 56:33.984
You trust these men
in a gun battle?

56:37.555 --> 56:39.390
Not for a second.

56:40.725 --> 56:44.061
Arnold Rothstein expects
to get what he pays for.

56:45.530 --> 56:48.032
He won't be getting it tonight.

56:59.547 --> 57:03.317
What's your pleasure, boss?

57:07.589 --> 57:09.089
Turn these rigs around.

57:09.124 --> 57:11.224
We're heading back
