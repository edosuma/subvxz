00:03.671 --> 00:09.217
Dr. Lee, call 4142.
Dr. Lee, 4142.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.353
Will it be much longer?

00:20.479 --> 00:22.355
We'll call you when we're ready.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.940
I've been waiting almost an hour.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.818
We'll call you when we're ready.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.069
I'm sorry.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.458
Saw him make
quite a throw yesterday.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.878
There's a liner to left field
coming to third base's right.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.672
Laskowski is up.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.507
The throw on the way to the plate.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.759
So she's really coming back?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.511
Who's coming back?

00:53.637 --> 00:55.930
You don't know her.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.600
You give her a raise?
Increase her benefits?

00:59.727 --> 01:03.020
Don't have TiVo on this thing.
Can't rewind. Shut up.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.149
You lower her hours?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.025
You don't even know her.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.737
Who is this guy?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.280
He's a patient.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.865
He's examining me.

01:13.991 --> 01:17.201
He's gotta go back to work as soon as
I'm done with the examination.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.704
Guess I do, too.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.622
It's gotta be something.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.041
I mean, she didn't come back
because she likes you.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.671
Wait a minute.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.216
She did come back
because she likes you.

01:33.469 --> 01:35.803
You dog. You slept with her.

01:35.929 --> 01:36.888
Keep talking.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.932
I'll finish your exam
with a prostate check.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.435
I've agreed to take her on one date.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.895
What?

01:44.062 --> 01:45.563
So, you into this girl?

01:45.689 --> 01:46.981
- Yes.
- No.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.066
She's not giving me any choice.

01:49.193 --> 01:52.779
Wait. She's making you do her?

01:53.822 --> 01:54.781
Date her.

01:54.907 --> 01:59.076
Young ingenue doctor, falling in love
with gruff, older mentor.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.789
Her sweet, gentle nature
bringing him to a closer,

02:02.915 --> 02:05.374
fuller understanding
of his wounded heart.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.751
Do her

02:08.295 --> 02:09.837
or you're gay.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.090
For God's sakes.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.553
Grow up. Or learn to harmonize.

02:20.432 --> 02:22.266
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.269
Who the hell walks around
with an open urine sample?

02:25.395 --> 02:28.022
I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't...

02:34.822 --> 02:36.781
You think that was
a bit of an over-reaction?

02:36.907 --> 02:39.784
Well, he peed on me. I'm not into that.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.411
It's apple juice.

02:42.538 --> 02:44.413
Now go find that guy and apologize.

02:44.540 --> 02:48.376
One more patient complaint,
and you're looking at a suspension.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.389
I forgive you for ruining my jacket.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.227
Look, you seem
like a regular kind of guy,

03:06.353 --> 03:08.855
not the type to get
another regular guy into trouble.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.189
Am I right?

03:13.527 --> 03:16.195
20 bucks cash if you'll stop crying.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.824
Forgive me. Yell at me.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.951
Just give me something
I can work with, okay?

03:36.425 --> 03:39.218
Game's over.
You two make nice?

03:39.344 --> 03:41.929
Get a wheelchair.
Gotta get this guy into the ER.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.432
What happened? Right pupil's blown.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.684
Holy... You gave the guy a stroke?

04:23.430 --> 04:26.182
So the bear wipes himself
with the rabbit.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.101
Lame.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.146
Hey.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.230
Yo.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.357
What are you doing here?

04:34.483 --> 04:35.441
I work here.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.985
What? Here, here? In this office?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.487
House practically begged me
to come back.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.405
Please tell me you took him
to the cleaners.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.324
Same lousy salary.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.408
Then why'd you do it?

04:44.534 --> 04:47.495
Because this is
the happiest place on earth.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.832
21-year-old male comes in
with grinding of the teeth.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.919
And House gives him a stroke.
Totally blew out his pupil.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.837
You scared a guy into stroking out?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.589
Does that surprise anyone here?

04:58.715 --> 05:00.967
Blown pupils usually means
brain stem edema.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.844
Sure, but since he's not dead
or in a coma,

05:03.971 --> 05:06.138
I'm going with stroke
to the optic nerve.

05:06.264 --> 05:09.600
CT scan shows two things.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.644
Ischemia, death of brain tissue.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.146
Means there's been some damage,
hopefully not permanent.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.356
And?

05:15.482 --> 05:16.524
And that's it.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.151
There's nothing there to tell us
what the underlying cause is.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.736
Gotta do an MRI.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.863
You're looking at
the wrong part of the scan.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.199
I'm looking at the brain.
What else is there?

05:25.283 --> 05:26.993
The jaw.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.953
The jaw tells us why he stroked?

05:29.079 --> 05:31.914
No, the jaw tells us
why we can't do an MRI.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.959
Unless we want his jawbone
flying across the room.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.545
Metal plate.
He's had major reconstruction,

05:37.671 --> 05:40.840
and there's no way we're removing it,
so we're forced to be clever.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.967
Angiogram to rule out vasculitis,

05:43.093 --> 05:46.846
EMG for peripheral neuropathy,
tox screen to eliminate drugs

05:46.972 --> 05:49.348
and echo to rule out cardiac emboli.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.812
Dr. Cameron, I'd appreciate you keeping

05:54.938 --> 05:57.815
the terms of your new contract
to yourself.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.943
Don't want everyone
clamoring for the same perks.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.449
What perks?

06:06.575 --> 06:07.575
Nothing you'd be interested in.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.160
So it's not money, then?

06:09.327 --> 06:10.911
Office space, insurance, parking?

06:11.038 --> 06:12.955
Anything he could offer you,
we'd be interested in.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.583
He agreed to go on a date with me.

06:16.251 --> 06:20.713
A date? Date, dinner-and-a-movie
naked-and-sweaty date?

06:20.839 --> 06:22.923
He only committed to the first two.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.676
He's so... He's so old.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.303
And you're so young.

06:27.929 --> 06:28.929
It's a big mistake.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.097
It's my boss.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.850
I'm allowed to sexually harass my boss.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.852
I'll arrange for the EMG.
You want to set up the angiogram?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.270
And you can get the blood samples,

06:36.354 --> 06:38.355
patient history, patient consent.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.945
Like watching an accident
about to happen.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.163
Morning.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.415
Harvey, I'm Dr. Foreman.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.167
I'm here to discuss your case.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.963
I'm Annette. I'm Harvey's friend.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.799
Nice to meet you.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.594
I need your next of kin. You didn't
fill that out on your intake form.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.305
Harvey's parents are dead.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.016
They died two years ago in a car crash.

07:14.726 --> 07:18.145
I see. So, Harvey,
you have any siblings?

07:18.271 --> 07:21.941
No. And no grandparents
or uncles or aunts.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.821
Annette, I don't want to
have to ask you to leave.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.531
I want her to stay.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.409
Well, she can stay. You do the talking.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.002
Why'd you come
to the clinic this morning?

07:42.921 --> 07:46.507
About six months ago,
I started grinding my...

07:49.386 --> 07:51.637
You know, in your mouth.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.597
You chew with them.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.933
Teeth.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.769
Harvey's experiencing
a little nominal aphasia.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.895
Hmm.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.355
You know,
when you can't remember nouns.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.441
Yeah, I think I know
what nominal aphasia is.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.111
Have you had any treatment
for the teeth grinding?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.988
I went to...

08:09.114 --> 08:12.658
You know, they do that thing
with the sharp pointy things.

08:12.784 --> 08:13.993
Needles? Someone took your blood?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.452
No. They make you breathe.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.620
Pulmonologist?

08:16.746 --> 08:18.455
No. She had this...

08:19.124 --> 08:21.792
She had that electrical machine.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.335
He saw an acupuncturist.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.587
Mmm-hmm.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.509
Do you know what the acupuncturist did?

08:30.635 --> 08:32.178
She diagnosed liver chi stagnation

08:32.304 --> 08:34.346
and sent Harvey to a Shen balancer.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.891
He referred him to a homeopathic
doctor,

08:37.017 --> 08:38.434
who sent him to a chiropractor.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.602
Naturally.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.770
Well, the chiropractor thought it might
be food sensitivity

08:41.897 --> 08:43.314
and sent Harvey to a naturopath.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.275
The naturopath sent me back to the...

08:46.401 --> 08:47.776
Back to the acupuncturist.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.069
Yes.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.364
Okay. Well, we'll need
to see the records

08:52.490 --> 08:54.992
of all of those practitioners.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.160
Okay.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.369
Thank you.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.710
Everything set for the angiogram?

09:04.836 --> 09:07.963
Cameron's got the EMG first.
Who's that?

09:09.090 --> 09:11.133
Harvey's guru.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.301
That's what she called herself?

09:13.511 --> 09:15.304
That's what she acted like.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.986
Hi. I'm having vaginal pain.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.741
Pleasure to meet you.

09:35.867 --> 09:40.788
My OB/GYN died recently.
He's a nice man.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.456
Warm hands.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.750
Not anymore.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.461
So, does it hurt when you tinkle?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.797
Yeah, that's when it's worst.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.469
You have some vaginal tearing.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.221
No sign of bruising.

09:57.347 --> 10:00.057
No indication of trauma, forced entry.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.894
Ramona, you naughty girl.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.273
Either you've got yourself
an 18-year-old boyfriend,

10:07.399 --> 10:10.109
or an 80-year-old
with some little blue pills.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.653
Myron thought he'd just try them out.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.862
Lucky you.

10:15.031 --> 10:15.990
I guess.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.285
You'd prefer it if Myron
was a little droopier?

10:19.411 --> 10:20.828
Maybe a little.

10:20.954 --> 10:26.834
We used to hold hands or read together
or watch Jeopardy!

10:27.877 --> 10:30.879
I haven't seen Jeopardy!
in almost a month.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.758
Have you talked to him about this?

10:34.884 --> 10:38.387
You try talking a 73-year-old
out of sex.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.180
With all these male enhancements,

10:40.307 --> 10:42.224
the pressure to put out's incredible.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.768
It's worse than high school.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.478
He doesn't get what he wants from me,

10:46.604 --> 10:49.565
he'll get it from Connie
in the corner condo.

10:49.691 --> 10:53.235
She's dying her hair red.
Major-league slut.

10:58.074 --> 11:02.453
Here's a prescription for vaginal
estrogen suppositories.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.580
It'll help with the lubrication.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.373
Thank you.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.127
Maybe you could give Myron
a prescription,

11:10.253 --> 11:12.755
something weaker than he's got now.

11:12.881 --> 11:16.133
Tell him it's better for his heart.
He'd buy that.

11:16.259 --> 11:19.303
You can't tell him the truth,
so you want me to lie to him?

11:19.429 --> 11:20.763
Would you?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.181
Close your legs.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.021
Nerves stimulate muscles
to move

11:29.147 --> 11:31.899
by creating a small electrical current.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.360
The machine will measure that.

11:35.403 --> 11:39.782
And I will insert this needle into
various muscles and ask you to flex.

11:40.658 --> 11:44.411
Sometimes it can be painful.
Let me know. I can pull back.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.662
No.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.332
I mean, it's okay.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.461
Okay. Put your arm out to the side.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.262
You all right?

12:02.389 --> 12:03.514
I'm good.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.683
You don't have to stop.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.021
Raise your arm over your head.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.118
The EMG was clean.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.330
Based on this history, it's either
toxic herbs from the homeopath,

12:28.456 --> 12:31.667
spinal damage from the chiropractor,
infection from a needle

12:31.793 --> 12:35.421
that the acupuncturist accidentally
let sit in eye of newt,

12:35.547 --> 12:37.381
or the Shen balancer.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.758
What the hell is a Shen,
and how come it's lopsided?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.803
The only abnormal test result we found
was on the echo report.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.888
Mitral valve prolapse.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.891
Hang up a shingle
and condemn the narrowness

12:48.017 --> 12:49.351
and greed of Western medicine.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.311
You can make a damn fine living.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.896
Clots form on the faulty valve,

12:53.022 --> 12:54.857
get sent to the brain, voila, stroke.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.025
Of course, no harm, no foul.

12:57.152 --> 13:00.821
It's just taking a few bucks
from superstitious idiots, right?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.825
Could also be an aneurysm
due to trauma.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.786
Trauma? From what?
The chiropractic treatments?

13:07.912 --> 13:10.330
It's bacterial endocarditis,
an infected valve.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.457
We should do blood cultures.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.959
Except the six months that he had
with these charlatans

13:14.085 --> 13:16.128
might have been better spent going to
someone who looks at things

13:16.254 --> 13:17.880
that exist in the real world,

13:18.006 --> 13:20.007
but that's just
me being all narrow again.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.260
I noticed a small bruit when I listened
to Harvey's left carotid.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.304
You could hear that if he had
an aneurysm from trauma.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.347
An aneurysm would have shown
on the angiogram.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.224
No, not necessarily.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.187
Hmm...

13:33.313 --> 13:34.897
Quite a dilemma.

13:35.982 --> 13:40.694
Oh, great pool-hall oracle,
grant me guidance.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.321
Do we go with Foreman's theory,

13:42.447 --> 13:44.823
which is at least marginally supported
by medical test results,

13:44.949 --> 13:46.909
or Chase's theory, that is completely

13:47.035 --> 13:49.870
unsupported by medical evidence?
What to do?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.747
The guy obviously broke his jaw
somehow.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.082
Who knows what other trauma
he's suffered?

13:54.209 --> 13:55.876
We should do the angiogram again.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.962
And all signs point to...

13:59.964 --> 14:03.258
Sorry, Chase. The gods have spoken.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.386
Start Harvey on blood thinners
and antibiotics.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.890
Wow. Yeah, I get it. House is adorable.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.684
I just want to hold him
and never let go.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.734
My God! What the hell are you doing?

14:20.860 --> 14:21.944
She's choking him.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.238
Foreman, stop. Let her go.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.572
She was trying to kill him.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.823
No. No, she wasn't.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.408
His vitals seem okay.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.077
Please, don't hurt her.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.540
What the hell is going on in here?

14:37.168 --> 14:39.378
She's a dominatrix.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.005
Right, Annette?

14:53.476 --> 14:55.769
The patient asked you
to strangle him?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.230
Harvey is an asphyxiophiliac.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.857
He likes to be strangled or smothered.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.693
That's just sick.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.945
Well, that's an intriguing
legal opinion.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.697
Geez. What kind of a lawyer is he?

15:06.823 --> 15:08.657
You want a legal opinion?
Call the cops.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.742
I was careful. I watched the monitors.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.786
Made sure his O2 sats were over 90.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.871
I would never hurt him.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.081
Then what was the point?

15:16.207 --> 15:17.708
Harvey was upset.

15:17.834 --> 15:22.004
He needed to calm down, to feel
in control by being controlled.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.714
Uh...

15:26.968 --> 15:29.177
He pays you for this?

15:29.304 --> 15:32.431
In return, he does my taxes
and cleans my house.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.602
We're not done here. We have to talk.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.812
Call the cops.
Bar her from the hospital.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.731
Force her to pierce your nipples.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.025
Not really medical decisions.

15:45.111 --> 15:49.615
It was a long time ago. I was seeing
this woman, a banker,

15:49.741 --> 15:53.827
and turns out, she liked to be burned.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.830
You actually dated someone
who likes to get burned?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.416
Yeah, why would you want to be
in a relationship with someone

15:59.542 --> 16:01.752
that's so obviously
only gonna lead to pain?

16:01.878 --> 16:02.878
Shut up.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.796
It was a weird scene.
I observed...

16:04.922 --> 16:08.300
Chase, did you know about this woman,
what she does?

16:08.426 --> 16:10.927
I met her at some parties, yeah.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.055
I wouldn't have tortured you if I knew
you liked it.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.932
Well, here's a phrase to remember.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.142
"Hey, this guy might have been

16:17.268 --> 16:18.935
"pounded on the head
one too many times."

16:19.062 --> 16:21.605
I said I thought it was
a trauma-induced aneurysm.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.523
Yeah. Could have carried
a tad more weight

16:23.650 --> 16:25.984
if you'd mentioned
the liking-pain thing.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.320
You're on my naughty list. Sorry.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.946
No leather stethoscope this Christmas.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.031
I'm not...

16:31.157 --> 16:32.157
I assume you never started him

16:32.283 --> 16:33.867
on antibiotics and blood thinners

16:33.993 --> 16:36.411
before Mistress Ilsa's
rude interruption.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.871
That was probably a good thing.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.332
Start him on antibiotics
and blood thinners.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.417
You still think
Chase is wrong?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.586
No, he's probably right.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.923
Then we should schedule him
for vascular surgery.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.384
Go into the carotids,
find the aneurysm, repair it.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.427
If we put him on blood thinners,
he might bleed out.

16:52.553 --> 16:56.723
But if Foreman's right about it
being bacterial endocarditis and...

16:57.308 --> 16:59.518
I think Chase is right.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.979
Okay. If Foreman used to be right
about it being blood clots

17:03.106 --> 17:04.773
and we take the surgery route,

17:04.899 --> 17:06.274
then we'll probably kill the guy,

17:06.401 --> 17:07.943
so start him on blood thinners,

17:08.069 --> 17:10.445
and if he has another stroke,
then we'll schedule the surgery.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.571
Yeah?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.115
You Dr. House?

17:13.616 --> 17:16.410
I have a feeling I'm gonna regret this,
but yes.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.580
Ramona said I should come to you
for my refill.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.960
You know, the wood's beginning
to droop.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.633
She said you'd probably want
to talk to me first.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.926
She lied.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.303
Here you go.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.472
Thanks.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.266
Always happy to make people happy.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.517
Good-bye.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.940
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.066
Much more of what?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.359
Sex.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.695
You don't want more sex?

17:52.029 --> 17:54.740
My golf swing is all messed up.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.993
Hey, here's a radical thought.
Talk to her.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.453
The truth?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.121
Sounds crazy when you put it like that.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.373
Ramona's got a big appetite.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.083
If I don't perform...

18:06.461 --> 18:08.503
I don't want to lose her.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.134
You got a pharmacy around here?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.594
In the hospital?

18:15.720 --> 18:18.305
Could be. Let's see if we can find it.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.608
Got any blue pills?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.944
You're looking for ED medication?

18:33.070 --> 18:34.905
Well, that's one example
of a blue pill.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.782
Name six others.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.074
There's a brand of acetaminophen...

18:38.201 --> 18:39.993
Perfect. Fill her up.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.707
Dr. House.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.959
Little busy here.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.922
I heard about Dr. Cameron's conditions
for coming back to work.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.757
It's purely business.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.634
I'll make sure you get the receipt.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.969
Well, I think it's a good thing.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.513
What happened
in your last relationship,

18:59.639 --> 19:02.933
it's no reason to wall yourself off
from people forever.

19:03.059 --> 19:06.019
Five years of self-pity
is probably enough.

19:06.145 --> 19:10.065
Wow. You've certainly given me
a lot to think about.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.983
If only I was as open as you.

19:12.109 --> 19:12.901
Well...

19:13.027 --> 19:16.112
Actually, it was your blouse
I was talking about.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.199
Bear in mind, Cameron's probably

19:19.325 --> 19:21.743
the only female who could tolerate you.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.538
Wear the sky-blue shirt.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.540
It almost makes you look nice.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.255
They said she couldn't come back
into the hospital.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.924
They won't let me see her.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.134
Harvey, you're lucky
she wasn't arrested.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.888
What were you thinking,
doing that at a hospital?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.974
Squeeze my fingers.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.267
I was scared.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.019
I'll need you to squeeze
with both hands.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.104
I am.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.441
Weakness in his right arm
and hand.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.236
Harvey's having mini-strokes. The blood
thinners aren't making a difference.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.280
Stop the treatment.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.907
Sorry. We tried your way.
You could not have been wronger.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.450
I said Chase was probably right.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.577
Oh, yeah.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.787
We've all got perfect 20/20 hindsight.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.080
Get a hold of May in Vascular.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.542
See if his surgical dance card is free
for tomorrow.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.921
About tomorrow night.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.298
You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.758
I didn't see any reason to.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.845
Where are we going? I want to make sure
I dress appropriately.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.806
That would be army boots and T-shirt.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.934
It's the county paint-ball tourney.
First prize is 50 bucks.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.686
I'll split it with you
if you hold your end up.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.479
I'm not sure that was the deal.

20:31.606 --> 20:35.191
Relax. I made a reservation
at Café Spoleto.

20:35.318 --> 20:39.029
Regarding wardrobe, are you too young
to remember spandex?

20:40.865 --> 20:42.908
I'll figure something out.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.788
The surgery will repair the damaged
blood vessels in your neck,

20:48.915 --> 20:50.832
and your strokes will stop.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.293
All this is because
of the strangulation?

20:53.461 --> 20:55.879
More like strangulations.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.218
My parents were right.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.513
I'm a loser.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.973
I don't know...

21:07.141 --> 21:08.600
I don't know what to do. I need to...

21:08.726 --> 21:09.893
Harvey, calm down.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.311
I need to talk to Annette.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.146
You can do this on your own.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.314
Surgery's the...

21:14.440 --> 21:15.565
She hates me.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.985
I've been calling. I've been calling,

21:19.153 --> 21:21.112
and she's not picking up.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.405
Harvey, you don't need her...

21:22.531 --> 21:26.993
I can't.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.174
Harvey, you will do what I say.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.009
I don't want surgery.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.804
Sign the consent. Sign it!

21:46.097 --> 21:48.431
I can't do anything.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.518
No surgery. No surgery!

21:52.770 --> 21:54.104
No surgery!

21:57.441 --> 21:58.692
We could give him
antidepressants.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.026
See if he changes his mind.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.779
I already did. Mashed them up
in his applesauce.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.072
It'll lighten him up soon enough.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.491
Someone should just tell him to do it.

22:06.617 --> 22:07.617
Way faster.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.536
So, it's forgery, also illegal.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.204
And I already tried.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.372
Not you.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.001
Where's a good dominatrix
when you need one?

22:16.544 --> 22:18.211
Annette's barred from the hospital.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.755
If you get caught,
Cuddy's got a hairbrush,

22:20.881 --> 22:22.799
and believe me,
she knows how to use it.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.518
They let you come back.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.439
Not because you deserve it.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.149
You've been bad.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.861
You will have the surgery.
Do you understand?

22:44.739 --> 22:45.947
No.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.908
Do not laugh at me.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.118
You will respect me.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.162
Where do you get off
telling me what to do?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.914
Get out of my room,
you bag-faced witch.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.375
Is this a part of their deal?

22:57.501 --> 22:58.960
This isn't like him.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.297
Something's wrong.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.298
Get out!

23:03.424 --> 23:08.178
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

23:08.304 --> 23:10.305
Emotional swings.
He's having another stroke.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.890
Harvey!

23:13.434 --> 23:16.144
He's crashing.
Can we get a cart in here?

23:23.986 --> 23:27.155
So what's that? Two strokes
you've scared this guy into?

23:27.281 --> 23:32.035
Yeah. It's making me question my view
of myself as a people person.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.245
Now you want to do surgery on him
without his consent?

23:34.371 --> 23:37.207
The kid's in a coma.
He needs the surgery.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.334
He said no. We can't do it.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.629
Emergent situation.
We invoke heroic measures.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.005
You need a court order.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.673
Great. Where do I get me one of them?

23:45.800 --> 23:46.925
Do I need to lawyer-up?

23:47.051 --> 23:49.928
I'll need to show the judge
an affidavit from next of kin.

23:50.054 --> 23:53.306
They might have a problem signing
anything, seeing as how they're dead.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.432
He'll want proof.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.101
Like what, Dad's hand?

23:56.227 --> 23:57.811
I don't even know where they're buried.

23:57.937 --> 24:02.357
Bring me a published obit or a death
certificate, and we'll run with it.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.484
I don't want you
to mess up your clothes.

24:07.738 --> 24:08.780
His parents were accountants.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.365
Maybe there's an obit
in the trade papers.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.492
Guy lives in Market Town. I don't know
if he grew up there,

24:12.618 --> 24:13.910
but we could check
the local funeral homes.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.204
Great, and when your searches
turn up nothing,

24:16.330 --> 24:17.872
you should try and find
where they live.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.374
He said they were dead.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.918
Accountants are usually pretty good
with money,

24:22.044 --> 24:24.796
so how come he lives in a slum
like Market Town?

24:24.922 --> 24:26.965
Maybe they were bad accountants.

24:27.091 --> 24:30.176
Two bad accountants from the Pacific
Rim? The odds are astronomical.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.761
Maybe Harvey burned through
their money.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.764
Or maybe they cut him off when they
found out about his proclivities.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.975
That'd be my bet. Go to his apartment.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.893
See if you can find his folks.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.146
Number, address, something.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.029
Hey. Can I talk to you?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.198
Sure.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.996
Look. Cameron's a friend.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.122
This whole dating...

24:59.248 --> 25:00.582
Time's up. Thanks for playing.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.042
Hey, I've been on the scene
more than you recently.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.294
Way ahead of you.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.755
I got a case of malt liquor
stashed in the trunk.

25:07.882 --> 25:09.924
Mr. Marvin Gaye on the CD.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.968
We are gonna get all the way down.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.720
Now move.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.931
Come on. You're not into her.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.433
Most guys who aren't interested in

25:18.559 --> 25:20.810
a woman try to sugarcoat it, be nice.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.937
Oh, you know me too well.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.397
That's what I'm saying.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.359
I think you should go
with your instincts here. Be a jerk.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.653
I'm missing my soap for this?

25:30.779 --> 25:32.906
Women love to be right.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.534
You gotta leave them feeling superior,
like they dodged a bullet,

25:36.660 --> 25:38.912
but if you're nice, she'll blame
herself...

25:39.038 --> 25:41.497
And fall for me even more.

25:41.624 --> 25:45.001
The love doctor has made an art
out of breaking up with women

25:45.127 --> 25:48.087
'cause you're convinced that the loss
of you would be too devastating

25:48.214 --> 25:49.464
for any woman to handle.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.928
Yeah. I'm the one
with the serious ego problem here.

25:56.180 --> 26:00.016
I'm just saying, some relationships
aren't meant to happen.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.906
Harvey's school registration.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.282
Permanent home address?

26:16.408 --> 26:17.825
Emergency contacts?

26:18.786 --> 26:20.370
Annette Raines.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.790
Mistress Annette.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.878
You had to extort a date out of House.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.506
You don't think that's a bad sign?

26:32.341 --> 26:33.633
Cameron?

26:34.051 --> 26:35.969
High-school yearbook.

26:37.346 --> 26:40.139
Think this might give us a clue,
Sherlock?

26:43.310 --> 26:45.270
House isn't gonna hand you anything.

26:45.396 --> 26:48.231
You want him, you gotta take him.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.899
Jump him.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.485
Harvey, H-A-R-V-E-Y.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.487
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you. Okay.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.531
Yes. Harvey Park.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.952
Great. We've been looking for you.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.955
I'm calling from the
Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.332
Harvey's here, and it's rather...

27:07.459 --> 27:08.626
He hung up.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.961
You tell him why you were calling?

27:10.087 --> 27:11.754
I didn't get a chance. Call back.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.131
I'll do it.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.177
Let the master show you how it's done.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.183
Mr. Park, this is Dr. House calling

27:24.310 --> 27:26.936
from Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching
Hospital in New Jersey.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.604
Your son Harvey is dead.

27:28.731 --> 27:30.440
We need you to identify the body.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.068
Yes. I'm sorry. It's the law.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.155
Okay.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.868
There's a real art
to delivering bad news.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.703
They're gonna show up at the morgue.

27:43.829 --> 27:47.040
Be sure and let me know
when Cuddy starts screaming.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.879
You lied to them!

27:53.005 --> 27:55.006
He told us our son was dead.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.009
It's only a white lie.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.095
Technically, all I did was call them
a little early.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.765
Trust me. He'll be dead real soon.

28:03.891 --> 28:07.018
Actually,
I saved you some rush-hour traffic.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.561
I'm calling our lawyer.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.231
Fine. Just as soon as you've signed
the surgery consent.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.151
I have a pen.

28:20.115 --> 28:24.535
Marilyn Park for Mark Lerner.
Yes, I'll hold.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.080
Harvey's your son.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.957
I'm sure you still care about him.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.126
He humiliated us.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.422
Everybody we know knows
about his perversion.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.259
But you don't get off on embarrassment
the way your son does.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.428
My guess, maybe it skips a generation.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.013
How much money would it take
to compensate...

28:44.139 --> 28:48.017
Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute,
but here's the thing.

28:48.894 --> 28:52.063
Humiliation comes
in all kinds of packages.

28:52.189 --> 28:56.943
People finding out that your son's
a perv, that's pretty high up there.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.780
People finding out that you'd rather
let your son die

29:00.906 --> 29:03.157
than sign a piece of paper.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.618
Where does that rank?

29:05.744 --> 29:08.079
And trust me,
if I have to paste up a sign

29:08.205 --> 29:09.956
in every nail salon and dumpling shop

29:10.082 --> 29:12.333
in Pennsylvania,
I'll make sure they know.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.562
Your son will be in surgery first thing
in the morning.

29:35.816 --> 29:39.026
Dumplings. That was a cheap shot.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.910
Hi. Are you...

29:48.620 --> 29:50.121
Can we talk?

29:51.290 --> 29:54.083
Gee, I wonder
what this is gonna be about.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.171
I just want to make sure
no one gets hurt.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.505
I will be fine.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.549
Everybody's acting like I'm going out
with Jack the Ripper.

30:01.675 --> 30:04.343
Oh. It's...
It's not you I'm worried about.

30:09.141 --> 30:13.102
It's been a long time
since he opened up to someone, and I...

30:13.812 --> 30:15.813
You better be absolutely sure
you want this,

30:15.939 --> 30:19.525
because if he opens up again
and gets hurt,

30:21.570 --> 30:24.864
I don't think there's gonna be
a next time.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.783
You're worried
I'm gonna break his heart?

30:39.296 --> 30:42.131
The wide side's too short.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.259
You're gonna look like Lou Costello.

30:47.221 --> 30:49.222
This is a mistake.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.892
I don't know how to have
casual conversation.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.936
You think you're talking
about one thing,

30:55.062 --> 30:57.730
and either you are,
and it's incredibly boring,

30:57.856 --> 31:02.109
or you're not because there's a
subtext, and you need a decoder ring.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.695
Open doors for her.
Help her with her chair.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.113
I have been on a date.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.157
Not since disco died.

31:08.867 --> 31:13.579
Comment on her shoes, her earrings,
and then move on to DHA.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.501
Her dreams, hopes and aspirations.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.711
Trust me. Panty peeler.

31:22.256 --> 31:24.757
And if you need condoms, I've got some.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.050
Did your wife give them to you?

31:26.176 --> 31:30.137
Drug rep. They've got antibiotics
built in somehow.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.224
I should cancel.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.977
I've got a patient in surgery
tomorrow morning.

31:36.103 --> 31:39.438
And if you were a surgeon,
that would actually matter.

31:40.857 --> 31:44.318
That's a good idea. Settle your nerves.
Get me a beer, too.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.736
No beer.

31:46.697 --> 31:49.031
You're gonna eat before dinner?

31:57.874 --> 32:00.001
This is pretty lame, right?

32:03.672 --> 32:05.548
I think she likes lame.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.385
It's beautiful.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.431
And you look very handsome.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.600
Thank you.

32:17.394 --> 32:19.353
I've always loved this restaurant.

32:19.479 --> 32:24.275
Yeah. It's changed a lot
since the last time I was here.

32:24.401 --> 32:26.444
Used to be a strip joint.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.116
Nice earrings.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.952
My mom's. Thank you.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.997
Nice shoes.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.499
Comfortable?

32:42.336 --> 32:45.421
I'm not expecting you
to be someone you're not.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.716
We're in a restaurant.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.092
We're dressed up. We're eating.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.219
Without small talk, what is there?

33:08.695 --> 33:12.073
According to Freud,
and I'm paraphrasing,

33:12.199 --> 33:13.449
the instinct of love toward an object

33:13.575 --> 33:15.826
demands a mastery to obtain it,

33:15.952 --> 33:17.995
and if a person feels
they can't control the object,

33:18.121 --> 33:19.413
or feel threatened by it,

33:19.539 --> 33:21.957
they act negatively toward it,

33:22.084 --> 33:24.960
like an eighth-grade boy
punching a girl.

33:25.879 --> 33:29.215
I treat you like garbage,
so I must really like you.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.137
Given your Freudian theory,
what does it mean

33:35.263 --> 33:37.390
if I start being nice to you?

33:37.808 --> 33:39.725
That you're getting in touch
with your feelings.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.562
So there's absolutely nothing I can do

33:43.689 --> 33:45.815
to make you think
that I don't like you?

33:46.149 --> 33:47.817
Sorry, no.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.951
I have one evening with you,
one chance,

33:57.077 --> 34:00.121
and I don't want to waste it
talking about what wines you like

34:00.247 --> 34:02.289
or what movies you hate.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.671
I want to know how you feel

34:10.757 --> 34:12.216
about me.

34:19.224 --> 34:23.728
You live under the delusion that you
can fix everything that isn't perfect.

34:24.104 --> 34:27.565
That's why you married a man
who was dying of cancer.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.402
You don't love, you need.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.614
And now that your husband is dead,

34:35.741 --> 34:39.076
you're looking
for your new charity case.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.871
That's why you're going out with me.

34:41.997 --> 34:45.958
I'm twice your age.
I'm not great-looking.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.669
I'm not charming. I'm not even nice.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.215
What I am is what you need.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.052
I'm damaged.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.656
Warm saline.

35:26.249 --> 35:29.001
Came in late. Good time last night?

35:29.127 --> 35:30.377
How's the surgery going?

35:30.504 --> 35:32.254
Harvey's doing fine so far.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.464
How'd the night go?

35:33.590 --> 35:35.216
It was fine. How was your evening?

35:37.177 --> 35:40.346
She had the ravioli.
I had the puttanesca.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.182
Yes, I really want to know
about the quality of the food.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.892
Either something very good happened

35:45.018 --> 35:47.102
or something very bad. Which is it?

35:47.229 --> 35:50.022
Well, I did have a little indigestion
afterwards.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.857
Maybe it was the garlic bread.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.276
Or the wine.
Something made my eyes puffy.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.029
Yeah. Crying in your pillow
can do that.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.280
It was the wine.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.991
We had a nice candid conversation.

36:01.952 --> 36:04.245
Nothing deep, mostly small talk.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.704
I'm sure.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.790
Took your advice.
Complimented her shoes.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.500
That's 15 minutes of chat right there.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.210
No snide comments?

36:11.336 --> 36:14.129
I guess, when we talked about you guys.

36:17.217 --> 36:18.759
Just answer one question.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.095
You two gonna do dinner again?

36:21.930 --> 36:23.514
I don't think so.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.976
I don't know.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.395
Hey, kids. You were wrong.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.314
No aneurysm, no nothing.
This guy's clean.

36:33.483 --> 36:37.111
Which means we've got no idea
what's causing the strokes.

36:37.237 --> 36:38.863
He's had two more post-op.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.155
We won't know the extent of the damage

36:40.282 --> 36:41.198
until he comes out of the coma.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.533
If he comes out.

36:42.659 --> 36:45.953
Maybe we should go back
to the blood thinners. Up the dosage.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.247
If it's not clots, a loading dose
of blood thinners

36:48.373 --> 36:50.666
is gonna make him bleed
out of his ears.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.084
Then he won't be able to hear.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.381
Nobody home. Leave a message.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.174
This is important.

37:01.845 --> 37:05.097
Chase, Cameron,
get another angiogram and echo.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.473
You better get a full body scan.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.977
If it is clots, it'd be good to know
where they are.

37:15.275 --> 37:18.110
Sorry about that. Guy dying.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.612
Those pills you gave Myron?

37:19.738 --> 37:21.363
They're not working.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.450
Well, good to see you've got the
correct perspective on the thing.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.037
Well, the old ones, I mean,
made me feel like a tree, you know?

37:28.163 --> 37:29.163
Nice visual.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.874
But the new ones,
I might as well be eating candy.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.334
Candy wouldn't take away
your headaches.

37:33.460 --> 37:34.877
What?

37:35.003 --> 37:37.880
You came to me and told me
that you were having too much sex.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.131
I never did.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.174
You too, sequoia.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.550
Well, no, that's not true.

37:41.718 --> 37:42.927
I know everybody lies,

37:43.053 --> 37:45.054
but you'd think that after a certain
amount of time together,

37:45.180 --> 37:47.264
you wouldn't be trying so hard.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.810
Your rings don't match.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.479
Why would they?

37:53.605 --> 37:57.149
The style is one thing,
but one silver, one gold?

37:57.233 --> 37:58.067
How long have you guys been married?

37:58.193 --> 37:59.151
Fifty-five years.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.486
Forty-nine years.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.823
Damn it. You're having an affair.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.743
Did you really say you wanted
to have less sex?

38:07.869 --> 38:09.286
Well, less.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.622
If I wanted none,
I'd stay home with Esther.

38:11.748 --> 38:13.666
I just need a little rest.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.877
You guys aren't the victims of the
little blue pills, you're the problem.

38:17.003 --> 38:17.836
I'm sorry.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.046
Me, too.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.256
I should just have told you how I felt.

38:21.383 --> 38:22.383
Aw.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.721
Oh, welcome to hell.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.195
Hey, how about the pills?

38:43.321 --> 38:46.156
Looks like you guys are good to go
drug-free for a while.

38:48.201 --> 38:52.162
Dr. Chase, these breath mints
you've been popping since yesterday,

38:52.288 --> 38:54.039
are they a new fetish?

38:54.165 --> 38:55.916
I found them at Harvey's.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.334
What? I just took two boxes.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.877
The guy's got a whole drawer of them.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.838
And you didn't find that interesting?

39:00.964 --> 39:03.799
Well, there's lots of interesting stuff
in his place.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.135
The mints weren't high up on the list.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.594
Wrong.

39:22.569 --> 39:25.154
Chase, get your nose in here.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.197
If you're trying to humiliate me,
I told you...

39:27.323 --> 39:29.366
Come on. Just put your face
in his mouth.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.375
Rich, wouldn't you say?

39:38.501 --> 39:40.169
Smells like old vomit.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.380
Number-one sign of fulminating
osteomyelitis.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.340
Infection of the jaw?

39:45.467 --> 39:47.134
Probably from the original break.

39:47.260 --> 39:49.094
Never healed properly.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.972
Infected tissue from the jaw
breaks off,

39:52.348 --> 39:54.683
blocks blood flow to the brain.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.687
And life just isn't worth living
without blood.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.065
It was hidden from the scans
by the metal plate.

40:01.191 --> 40:04.151
And an infection in the jaw is unlikely
to show up in blood tests.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.986
So how do we confirm?

40:06.112 --> 40:07.279
Like this.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.253
Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus.

40:26.674 --> 40:29.051
We're gonna remove the jaw.

40:29.177 --> 40:32.179
Anybody got a buzz saw?
Okay, call a surgeon.

41:03.753 --> 41:06.380
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.300
How's tricks, Annette?

41:14.973 --> 41:17.391
I just wanted to see if he was okay.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.268
I'll leave.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.062
It's okay. I came to talk to you both.

41:23.356 --> 41:25.107
Like I tell all my patients,

41:25.233 --> 41:28.152
you've simply got to say
no to strangulation.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.323
Me, I'm a freak.
I get off on not being in pain.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.619
That and chocolate-covered
marshmallow bunnies.

41:37.745 --> 41:39.454
He's not a freak.

41:39.581 --> 41:42.291
Yeah, he is, a little.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.626
But it's gotta stop,

41:45.336 --> 41:46.795
or he'll die.

41:48.590 --> 41:50.299
It's not about pain.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.635
It's about being open

41:54.345 --> 41:58.223
and completely vulnerable
to another person.

42:00.393 --> 42:03.854
If you can learn to be
that deeply trusting,

42:05.690 --> 42:07.357
it changes you.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.701
Well, lock him in a cage.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.704
That should be fine, medically.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.292
Dr. House?

42:29.214 --> 42:31.340
Were my parents here?

42:34.719 --> 42:36.720
Did they come to see me?
