CHILD PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT
BERLIN - CHARLOTTENBURG

00:40.499 --> 00:43.627
- Maybe it was beginner's luck.
- It wasn't luck.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.338
Somethings wrong with him.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.675
Theo, please take
a good look at the cards.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.804
Okay?

00:58.141 --> 01:00.978
- How are things at your new school?
- Good.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.230
- Have you made any friends?
- No.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.402
Telephone.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.240
Sheep.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.077
<i>When I was seven,
I realized my brain</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:20.414
<i>never forgets
anything it's ever heard or seen.</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:23.250
<i>They call it "photographic memory".</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:26.795
<i>In other words, my head is a chip card</i>

01:26.962 --> 01:29.381
<i>with unlimited memory capacity.</i>

01:30.007 --> 01:31.800
<i>Unfortunately, there are drawbacks</i>

01:32.050 --> 01:34.845
<i>to your brain not having
a "delete" function.</i>

01:39.891 --> 01:41.184
<i>My boy!</i>

01:41.768 --> 01:43.562
<i>Apart from the sex with my mother,</i>

01:43.812 --> 01:46.440
<i>my father was always
my greatest role model.</i>

01:46.607 --> 01:49.818
<i>He was Captain
of the Border Protection Group 10.</i>

01:53.030 --> 01:54.740
Congratulations, Erwin.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.871
Will you join the BPG 10
and chase the bad guys, too?

02:01.038 --> 02:05.125
Our Theo is too sensitive for that.
He's going to be a bookworm.

02:09.086 --> 02:13.467
I looked into the pros and cons
of whether we should be friends.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.760
Point nine...

02:14.926 --> 02:19.681
<i>Experts say that gifted people
tend to be socially awkward.</i>

02:20.390 --> 02:24.102
<i>To be honest, I never thought
I'd be able to impress women.</i>

02:24.728 --> 02:29.316
Point eleven: By studying with me,
you'd improve in most subjects.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.069
Especially in natural sciences,

02:32.235 --> 02:35.572
where your grades
leave a lotto be desired.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.116
- Who is this guy?
- I have no idea.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.286
<i>And I was right.</i>

02:41.536 --> 02:45.082
It's unacceptable
to walk out on this conversation!

02:45.207 --> 02:47.125
That was only point twelve!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.129
<i>The happiest day of my life?</i>

02:51.380 --> 02:53.298
Police Officer Candidate Theo Ransoff.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.551
<i>My swearing-in ceremony at the BPG 10.</i>

02:56.718 --> 02:58.887
<i>I was one of
the intellectual high-flyers,</i>

02:59.137 --> 03:01.515
<i>and I'd finally made my father happy.</i>

03:01.682 --> 03:04.726
<i>This was a moment
of immense joy for me.</i>

03:15.237 --> 03:18.031
We are the perfect combination
of superior intellect

03:18.198 --> 03:20.450
and absolute body control.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.543
<i>My superiors
recognized my true strengths</i>

03:29.793 --> 03:32.963
<i>and assigned me
to the beating heart of the unit.</i>

03:35.424 --> 03:36.508
<i>The armory.</i>

03:36.758 --> 03:40.345
<i>To account for,
record and keep tight control</i>

03:40.595 --> 03:42.639
<i>over the entire inventory.</i>

03:42.889 --> 03:45.684
<i>But even sophisticated systems
have a weakness.</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:48.353
<i>Ours is called...</i>

03:48.979 --> 03:50.981
<i>Luke Steiner.</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:54.985
<i>49, divorced.</i>

03:55.152 --> 03:56.862
<i>43 missions.</i>

03:57.070 --> 03:58.655
<i>And 29 warning notices.</i>

04:01.408 --> 04:05.454
<i>He's the most successful officer
the BPG 10 ever had.</i>

04:06.329 --> 04:07.789
<i>And also the oldest.</i>

04:12.502 --> 04:15.839
That weapon wasn't properly signed out
by the previous user.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.341
That means I can't let you take it.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.518
- Is something wrong?
- Know who you remind me of?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.146
My aunt Helga.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.067
Rules only make sense
if we all stick to them.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.862
Exactly what Helga would've said.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.531
You even look a bit like her.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.122
And this doesn't belong here!

04:49.998 --> 04:53.293
<i>There's an armed robbery
in progress at a museum downtown.</i>

04:53.543 --> 04:56.797
There are hostages.
The exhibits are church treasures,

04:57.005 --> 05:00.592
which are not only sacred,
but also damn expensive!

05:00.842 --> 05:04.763
The government promised the Pope
we'd do everything possible

05:04.930 --> 05:06.097
to secure the relics.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.683
That means
we are not to damage anything.

05:08.850 --> 05:13.063
If there's even a scratch on anything,
you'll be on patrol duty tomorrow.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.272
Questions?

05:14.564 --> 05:17.192
My name is, A, not Helga!

05:17.442 --> 05:19.694
And I am, B, not a woman!

05:19.945 --> 05:21.863
And, C, since the day I was born,

05:22.072 --> 05:26.368
my penis has been much bigger
than the German average!

05:26.618 --> 05:28.161
So there!

05:31.790 --> 05:34.167
Glad we're all clear on that.
Come on, guys!

05:34.459 --> 05:35.919
Get into the vehicles.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.092
Bring everything back in good condition.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.435
Good luck, boys.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.006
Don't let them provoke you.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.283
I'll take over.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.415
All units get in position.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.546
- He's doing something.
- I see it.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.590
They're coming out.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.470
They've got a child. It's a girl!

07:16.937 --> 07:19.397
We don't understand what you're saying!

07:21.358 --> 07:23.610
We want a helicopter.
You have 30 minutes.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.487
30 minutes.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.989
One minute more and... boom!

07:29.866 --> 07:32.202
Stand down. Let's stay calm.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.913
Do you all copy? Steiner?

07:36.164 --> 07:38.333
Has anyone seen Steiner?

07:46.841 --> 07:49.844
Steiner, I forbid you
from entering the crime scene!

07:55.266 --> 07:56.726
He's crazy.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.862
Steiner, de-escalate the situation.
De-escalate at once!

08:15.245 --> 08:16.913
What are they shooting at?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.501
Steiner, retreat immediately.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.545
<i>If I hear one more shot,
one single shot...</i>

08:31.594 --> 08:35.640
I know he thinks I'm ridiculous, but
couldn't he ignore me like the others?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.018
Don't take it personally.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.230
Steiner's a bully.
Typical foster home child.

08:43.063 --> 08:46.985
His mother left them when he was young.
His father beat him and drank.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.654
When he went to beat his sister,

08:49.821 --> 08:52.490
Steiner knocked him outwith a bottle.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.325
He was seven at the time.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.162
Poor boy. He was only seven.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.957
He found out early
that talking doesn't bring much.

09:05.420 --> 09:09.215
What's with the lights?
I need lights in there!

09:18.725 --> 09:20.143
Kalle. Where are you?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.937
- Boss, the Vatican.
- The Vati-what?

09:23.188 --> 09:25.315
The Vatican.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.734
- I'm not there.
- They can hear you.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.578
- Drop it.
- It was all just for fun.

09:40.121 --> 09:43.333
- The power's back.
- "The power's back"?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.753
- Turn on the damn lights then!
- Turn on the lights.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.965
Turn on the lights!

09:52.258 --> 09:54.260
We're going home now, okay?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.724
The operation was a success.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.070
BPG 1 O HEADQUARTERS

10:12.278 --> 10:13.988
A success? Really?

10:14.155 --> 10:19.369
You destroyed a historical, unique
church window worth 11.6 million euros!

10:19.536 --> 10:22.747
11.6 million?
It wasn't even double-glazed.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.709
You also disobeyed
the explicit orders of your superior.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.130
And that would be me.
I'm your damn superior!

10:30.380 --> 10:34.092
I saved a child.
And eleven other hostages, too.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.636
- Pure luck.
- Luck had nothing to do with it.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.057
I can't believe it.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.059
Hey!

10:43.226 --> 10:45.937
I had to wait five years
for the car you're leaning on!

10:46.187 --> 10:49.399
Its bulletproof windows
laugh in the face of AK-47s.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.944
If there's a scratch on it,
you're going to the pound.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.906
- Why the pound?
- No one would pick him there either.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.744
Here.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.789
BPG 10 SHOOTS VATICAN

11:04.956 --> 11:06.541
See what you've done?

11:08.376 --> 11:12.005
Your luck will run out at some point
and I'll have to attend your funeral.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.300
If you keep smoking like that,
I'll be attending yours.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.843
You are hilarious.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.388
- Good day. I have a parcel for...
- Get out!

11:21.890 --> 11:23.641
I had to meet with the mayor.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.979
I had to kiss every ass
from here to the Chancellor's Office!

11:28.271 --> 11:29.522
Tic Tao?

11:29.814 --> 11:32.192
The Interior Secretary wants you fired.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.069
- And you said "no".
- No.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.740
I said "yes".

11:39.866 --> 11:43.661
With a big smile on my face
and a warm, fuzzy feeling.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.081
Again?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.626
Yes, in case
there's an opening in the task force.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.378
It's the 16th time in three months.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.298
It couldn't have been that many.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.425
You will report here.

11:57.675 --> 12:01.554
You can come back when you prove to me
that you've come to your senses.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.848
And now say, "Thanks, Mother".

12:04.015 --> 12:06.684
- I'm not a night watchman.
- You are as of today.

12:27.997 --> 12:33.336
I have 15 applications from you
to join the task force. And now this?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.755
- Is it really the 16th?
- In three months.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.930
- You're a big fan of Steiner, right?
- Well...

12:45.431 --> 12:47.183
Let's just say 'colleague'.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.520
Know what? It's your lucky day.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.898
I have the perfect job for you.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.905
BELLEVUE PALACE, BERLIN

13:01.739 --> 13:03.992
SIDE ENTRANCE

13:15.253 --> 13:17.046
Mr. Steiner...

13:17.213 --> 13:21.551
What a unique opportunity, guarding
our Head of State's headquarters!

13:21.718 --> 13:25.638
- Guarding the door to the stairwell.
- And willing to sacrifice our lives.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.765
Why don't we just work in silence?

13:28.308 --> 13:31.227
- Stay quiet and concentrate.
- Sure.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.022
Staying quiet and concentrating
is my thing.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.649
As quiet and silent as a ninja.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.947
Where are you going?
We need to stand guard!

13:43.114 --> 13:46.451
- To take a dump.
- That's what the lunch break is for!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.331
I think you're lost.

14:33.581 --> 14:38.002
We can't leave our posts
without the case officer's permission.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.004
I need to take a dump, Helga.

14:40.254 --> 14:43.383
Permission can be granted
in writing or orally.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.803
Or with your partner's consent,
and that would be me.

14:47.053 --> 14:51.224
We're not partners. I'm in the BPG 10.
You're a girl in a poncho.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.185
- Now close the door.
- I'm not a girl.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.898
- The door is closed.
- From the outside.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.921
<i>...a stroke of luck for German history.</i>

15:22.171 --> 15:25.550
<i>Our country's aim was...</i>

15:25.716 --> 15:28.177
So, how was your first day?

15:28.386 --> 15:31.806
It was great.
My partner and I clicked right away.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.016
We trust each other blindly.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.399
Have you met the President yet?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.735
He's guarding
the entrance to the garage.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.696
To the stairwell.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.490
Theo got more points
on the aptitude test than you did.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.578
Ten-finger typing
doesn't guarantee he'll join the unit.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.747
You could invite
your new friend over for dinner.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.792
I don't think he's into canapés.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.422
- I'm so proud of you.
- Where's the remote?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.592
Thanks, Mom.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.845
- Inge?
- Back there, on the left.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.860
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:45.338 --> 16:49.467
- You still haven't unpacked.
- I have. These are my girlfriend's.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.304
Oh! The blonde inflatable one?

16:53.513 --> 16:57.517
She's hot and doesn't complain
when I come home late.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.312
She'll soon realize
her new guy only cares about one thing.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.105
His job, his job and his job.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.441
Everything else comes much later.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.903
- I thought you'd be bringing Ella.
- She's with friends.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.239
It's past eight.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.700
They're around the corner,
eating kebabs.

17:14.867 --> 17:19.955
What a relief! They say kebabs are great
for preventing unwanted pregnancies.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.208
She's on the pill.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.212
She's on the pill?
Since when is she on the pill?

17:26.378 --> 17:27.755
And Why?

17:28.005 --> 17:32.218
For a few months now. Do me a favor
and stop acting so panicky.

17:32.385 --> 17:36.222
We're talking about contraception,
not crack or ecstasy.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.309
- Here.
- What am I getting her this time?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.978
Suede boots.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.357
This is the last time
I get your present for her.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.820
I've nothing to worry about.
You'll never change.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.114
It's a good thing we both never change.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.492
That's why separating
was such a great idea.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.122
Don't forget to call tomorrow.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.832
Good night, Hanna.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.676
Good night, Daddy.

18:21.017 --> 18:24.895
- You're not wearing your helmet.
- It's enough if one of us looks stupid.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.649
- The top button should be done up.
- Would you shut up?

18:28.816 --> 18:33.321
- You're violating regulations.
- Which I'm sure you know by heart.

18:33.529 --> 18:37.783
Paragraph 9, section 3: Alcohol abuse
can lead to disciplinary problems,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.202
resulting in
the removal from official duties,

18:40.369 --> 18:43.331
or the loss of entitlement to pension.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.541
So you're also funny without alcohol.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.211
- I'm not funny.
- You don't say!

19:09.398 --> 19:11.025
Who's that chick?

19:11.233 --> 19:13.235
The honorable Mascha Tatjana Butkina.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.447
Daughter of the Moldovan President
Semjon Michailovitsch Butkin

19:16.697 --> 19:19.492
and his wife Viktorija Elena Butkina.

19:19.742 --> 19:22.828
She went to the best schools
in England, Germany and Switzerland,

19:22.995 --> 19:27.208
and she's revered by everyone
who hopes for political change.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.127
Baby, you can suck from my straw.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.971
Excuse me, could you tell me
where I can get rid of this?

19:42.515 --> 19:44.809
I can never find a trash can
in these palaces.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.561
There's a waste
separation system in place

19:47.812 --> 19:51.440
in the utility room, which can be used
by staff and guests at any time.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.318
I thank you on behalf
of all guests and staff.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.028
Thank you.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.826
I'm a great admirer of your work.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.953
You speak Romanian!

20:04.787 --> 20:05.705
A little.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.127
Duty calls.
It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr...

20:12.837 --> 20:14.255
Eheo.Eheo.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.925
- Eheo,
- A real pleasure, Eheo.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.094
I'm Mascha.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.602
- Mascha!
- You were very kind to me.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.980
That doesn't happen often.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.690
Thank you.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.067
You're welcome.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.196
Great conversation.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.574
That's how love goes.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.535
It can strike like lightning.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.620
Mascha and I are one and the same.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.248
I should ask her out to dinner.
Something classy.

20:49.498 --> 20:53.919
With candles, and decorative plants
and gondolas. Yes, gondolas.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.630
- She won't go outwith you.
- Why not?

20:56.881 --> 21:00.176
Because she's a girl.
Girls can sniff out virgins.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.346
- I'm an Aries.
- Man, I'm not talking about star signs.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.728
Just so you know,
I've already had intercourse.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.730
Oral, vaginal and anal!

21:14.023 --> 21:15.316
Does your butt hurt now?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.360
Welcome to Bellevue Palace.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.781
I won't stand for such insinuations.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.992
I'm a highly skilled agent.
This is hardcore police work.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.745
- It's okay, Helga!
- Good evening.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.834
Excuse me. Do you have a tissue?

21:34.084 --> 21:36.545
My nose is bleeding.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.676
That's disgusting.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.264
What about my tissue?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.602
Here. Use this, okay?

21:53.229 --> 21:54.605
Come on, let's go.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.071
<i>Happy birthday!
I was about to call.</i>

22:02.238 --> 22:04.323
<i>Dad'?
- What is it?</i>

22:04.573 --> 22:06.450
Why are you dressed like that?

22:07.493 --> 22:11.205
<i>I've been promoted.
I look after the President now.</i>

22:11.330 --> 22:13.791
No one
will take you seriously like that.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.877
<i>Did you like the boots?
I picked them out myself.</i>

22:17.169 --> 22:19.213
No, you didn't. Mom did, as always.

22:19.380 --> 22:23.050
I just wanted to make sure
my favorite daughter got the right ones.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.804
- You could've <i>stopped</i> by.
- We'll celebrate later. Just us two.

22:27.096 --> 22:30.224
By the way,
your mom said something about the pill.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.769
<i>- She was joking, right?
- Everyone is taking it, okay?</i>

22:33.978 --> 22:34.937
<i>What?</i>

22:35.187 --> 22:37.648
I didn't want to be
the only one not on it.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.150
<i>Aren't you too young for that?</i>

22:40.442 --> 22:41.819
It's none of your business.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.655
<i>How dare you talk to me like that?
I'm your dad!</i>

22:44.780 --> 22:47.533
Funny you only remember that
when you're mad.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.910
<i>Now, you listen to me, missy...</i>

22:51.120 --> 22:54.290
- What's with the chopper?
- What chopper?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.667
<i>- The one</i> behind you.
<i>- Don't change the subject.</i>

22:56.834 --> 22:59.670
- I'm not done yet.
- No, Dad. We're so done here.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.673
Wow.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.383
Ella?

23:05.759 --> 23:07.887
Your dad looks after the President?

23:08.095 --> 23:10.097
- Is he a bodyguard?
- A bodyguard?

23:10.347 --> 23:13.142
No, he's in some kind of special unit.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.521
What's wrong?

23:18.105 --> 23:22.401
- But he knows about us, right?
- Of course! He's chill.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.492
I can't believe it.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.075
Hands up! Surrender!
I'm a police officer.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.709
- Help!
- Mascha?

24:21.877 --> 24:23.253
Help!

24:28.008 --> 24:29.593
Mascha, I'm coming!

24:38.185 --> 24:39.561
Do something!

24:39.812 --> 24:41.605
What do they want from me?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.273
They'll kill me!

24:44.400 --> 24:47.027
Save the President's daughter!

24:56.203 --> 24:57.830
Mr. Steiner! My glasses!

24:59.873 --> 25:01.458
Excuse me.

25:05.879 --> 25:09.550
Mr. Steiner! Don't panic.
I've calculated your position of fall.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.719
I'll catch you!

25:11.969 --> 25:13.095
Mr. Steiner!

25:16.932 --> 25:18.183
We got you!

25:22.646 --> 25:26.442
Sorry. I lost my glasses,
and dust always gives me pink eye.

25:29.778 --> 25:30.946
Fuck.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.865
This isn't a "fuck".

25:33.490 --> 25:36.952
This isn't even fuck's
ugly, fat older sister.

25:37.244 --> 25:40.831
This is a massive fuck tornado

25:40.998 --> 25:44.084
which hit me
right in the kisser at full-force!

25:44.793 --> 25:45.794
Here.

25:47.087 --> 25:52.593
<i>16 million, or you can scrape
the President's daughter off the wall.</i>

25:52.760 --> 25:54.303
<i>Or whatever's left of her.</i>

25:56.513 --> 25:57.598
Mascha...

25:57.765 --> 25:59.767
<i>You were very kind to me.</i>

26:01.727 --> 26:07.066
27 million clicks. That's 27 million
people who are laughing at our unit.

26:08.025 --> 26:10.861
I think I speak
for both of us when I say

26:11.111 --> 26:13.989
we'll start
the investigation immediately.

26:15.032 --> 26:18.035
- That's so nice of you.
- It goes without saying.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.206
You know what? You're both off the case.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.127
But we haven't even started yet.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.548
You're both suspended!
Period. Done. Finito.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.258
Get out!

26:37.471 --> 26:38.972
Steiner!

26:40.849 --> 26:45.687
If I find out that this mess
was even a tiny bit your fault,

26:45.854 --> 26:47.189
then I'll crucify you.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.483
I'll make a cross out of old crates

26:49.650 --> 26:52.444
and nail you to it
as a warning to everyone else!

26:52.611 --> 26:55.405
Your days as Cowboy Steiner
are now over!

27:05.874 --> 27:08.585
I can't be suspended.
Not on my second day.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.838
What will I tell my parents?

27:11.755 --> 27:14.091
Thanks for making me lose my job.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.427
- I'm sorry, Mr. Steiner.
- You're a disgrace to the unit.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.767
Is everything Okay?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.603
Helga?

27:29.815 --> 27:31.066
Helga!

27:34.278 --> 27:36.321
Everything's going to be okay.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.615
You're just hyperventilating.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.742
No crying now.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.873
Blow.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.002
That's good.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.753
Breathe in.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.841
And blow.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.885
Yes.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.097
Keep blowing.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.811
Is this an unused condom?

28:08.061 --> 28:10.105
It was, until last night.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.742
Hey! It's nothing personal.

28:22.826 --> 28:25.245
Boss, the Interior Secretary.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.208
She should powder her nose
or send her husband a smiley.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.793
She should wait like everyone else!

28:32.461 --> 28:34.588
I'm afraid she doesn't have the time.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.715
The opposition demands your resignation

28:36.882 --> 28:40.552
and now wants to tear open
your old, wrinkly ass more than ever.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.805
As for the smileys,
she refrains from such acts.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.350
She's happily divorced,
just like your wife.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.477
Of course, Madam Secretary.

28:49.603 --> 28:53.148
- What's the plan?
<i>- I'll</i> find the girl and get my job back.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.691
- How exactly?
- As always.

28:54.858 --> 28:58.403
I'll beat someone up
until they tell me what I need to know.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.530
- Awesome. I'll come with you.
- Nope.

29:00.697 --> 29:03.784
- Yes, it's my duty as your partner.
- We're not partners.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.703
We have to save Mascha.
She expects us to.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.955
Well, me.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.166
She doesn't even know your real name.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.542
I'm used to that.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.586
Go back to your computer.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.381
I'm the only witness.

29:17.673 --> 29:21.134
They were masked.
You didn't even see their faces.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.512
One has a scar behind his right ear,

29:23.762 --> 29:26.682
a silver earring
with Celtic symbols on the left ear,

29:26.807 --> 29:28.892
black suede sneakers
with nylon supports,

29:29.184 --> 29:33.230
a digital men's quartz watch,
as well as a tattoo on the lower arm,

29:33.438 --> 29:35.315
of a snake with an open mouth.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.734
How do you know all that?

29:38.193 --> 29:39.861
Photographic memory.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.239
A freak of nature,
but I'm freakishly good.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.617
Hey! Do I speak French?

29:49.079 --> 29:51.623
Hey! Don't you ever shut up?

29:52.291 --> 29:55.544
Okay. You drive.
I'm a very experienced passenger.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.508
Hey! Don't touch it.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.512
Very well, but in that case
I might have to tell

30:05.679 --> 30:09.057
the Federal Criminal Police Chief
to check your phone.

30:09.349 --> 30:13.228
I'm quite certain
that your last private call

30:13.395 --> 30:16.023
was made at the same time
as the abduction.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.525
You miserable little rat.

30:19.526 --> 30:22.070
Rats are highly intelligent animals.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.329
I'll be quiet.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.883
<i>Welcome to McDonald's.
How may I help you?</i>

30:43.133 --> 30:46.178
A Big Mac, large fries
with mayo and a coffee.

30:46.428 --> 30:48.305
- Would that be all?
- No.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.724
First off, good day.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.352
I'd like a double cheeseburger,

30:53.518 --> 30:56.772
but no onions or pickles,

30:56.897 --> 31:00.108
with tomato instead,
double mustard sauce

31:00.567 --> 31:03.070
and no ketchup.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.988
- What?
- No ketchup.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.657
<i>Double cheese
doesn't come with tomato.</i>

31:07.908 --> 31:11.870
Which burger comes with tomato,
but without pickles or onion?

31:11.995 --> 31:15.040
<i>The Hamburger Royal TS
comes without pickles.</i>

31:15.707 --> 31:19.586
No. Then I'll have a vanilla milkshake
with a dash of strawberry.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.713
<i>- Thank you'.
- Hurry up, man!</i>

31:23.507 --> 31:26.009
- Hurry up, man!
- You're taking forever!

31:26.760 --> 31:31.223
Mr. Steiner, we need to come up with
a code to use in an emergency.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.684
What do you think?
A code word. Like a safe word...

31:34.851 --> 31:37.354
Listen up, Helga.
I'll only say this once.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.731
You're nothing more than a witness.

31:39.981 --> 31:44.486
If you see, hear or remember anything,
then you'll tell me.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.906
- If not, keep quiet.
- I really need to breathe now.

31:48.532 --> 31:51.159
And we won't be having
any shitty code words,

31:51.326 --> 31:56.373
just because all you know about police
work comes from the "idiot's Handbook".

31:57.707 --> 32:01.044
- I was top of my class.
- We also have hot dogs.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.550
Hot dog.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.010
We'll take two hot dogs.

32:09.803 --> 32:11.596
"Hot dog", Mr. Steiner.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.349
It's easy to recall.
And it's not too long.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.476
And everyone likes sausages.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.312
Unless you're a vegetarian.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.573
So, where to now?

32:30.615 --> 32:33.535
EMBASSY OF MOLDOVA

32:38.123 --> 32:41.293
- That's the embassy of Moldova.
- Yeah, now I see it.

32:41.543 --> 32:44.045
We're suspended.
We shouldn't be near the embassy.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.090
I need binoculars
in order to see anything.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.302
We're far, far away from any embassy.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.262
Give me those!

32:54.973 --> 32:57.934
- Give me... Give me those!
- Hands off.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.896
- It's for your own safety.
- Let go!

33:01.104 --> 33:03.190
I'll smash your head with them.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.986
Who do we have here?

33:12.365 --> 33:14.701
Steiner, you're not supposed to be here.

33:14.951 --> 33:18.455
Or do I need to tell Hanna
you're in trouble again?

33:18.622 --> 33:22.542
Oh, didn't she tell you?
What a chatterbox I am.

33:22.751 --> 33:26.588
We went out a couple of times.
You know, I always liked your Hanna.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.509
- We can talk better now, can't we?
- What did you just say?

33:30.759 --> 33:33.887
- That I went outwith your Hanna.
- Before that?

33:34.137 --> 33:36.306
That you and your buddy should piss off.

33:36.556 --> 33:37.807
Steiner, stop it!

33:38.058 --> 33:39.726
Let me go, you asshole!

33:49.694 --> 33:53.532
You'll pay for this, Steiner!
I'll make sure of it!

33:53.698 --> 33:56.451
- Is this attack linked to...
- Shut up!

34:00.288 --> 34:01.540
Boss?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.292
- Hedmann on line three.
- Who?

34:04.584 --> 34:06.253
Hedmann.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.925
Hey, Arno. I was just about to call you.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.636
Congratulations, first of all.

34:15.469 --> 34:19.139
You'd better keep your
amateur cops exactly where they are.

34:19.431 --> 34:22.936
Far away from my investigation.
Am I clear? Am I clear?

34:23.186 --> 34:24.271
Of course.

34:24.563 --> 34:28.567
I wanted to ask if you could put in
a good word for me with the Secretary.

34:28.733 --> 34:32.362
As a friend and new Head
of the Federal Criminal Police Office.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.281
I won't tell her shit!

34:34.489 --> 34:36.533
Keep Steiner out of it. Understood?

34:36.783 --> 34:37.867
Of course.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.829
Arno'?

34:48.168 --> 34:51.464
Will trespassing on embassy property
get us in trouble?

34:51.715 --> 34:53.550
I'm counting on it.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.719
Okay. You're counting on it.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.937
I need some information.

35:16.031 --> 35:19.743
- That wasn't very nice.
- What did he say?

35:19.909 --> 35:22.746
"Get out of here,
you lovers of hairy asses."

35:23.455 --> 35:25.123
- Is that what he said?
- Yes.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.585
Listen up, dickface.

35:32.756 --> 35:36.801
Mascha: friends, enemies
and weekend hangouts.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.179
What does she do
when she gets in your car?

35:49.564 --> 35:53.902
I take her to the "Bunker" twice a week,
but I don't know who she meets there.

35:54.069 --> 35:57.489
- There we go.
- Mr. Steiner... Do you have a moment?

36:17.759 --> 36:21.221
Please excuse my overzealous colleagues.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.515
We're a young country,

36:23.682 --> 36:27.811
and many of us
have paid a high price for our freedom.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.856
We still get jumpy when we feel...

36:32.440 --> 36:33.983
under attack.

36:36.986 --> 36:40.365
Mascha's parents are...

36:41.991 --> 36:43.493
in a bad state.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.161
Mascha is...

36:48.081 --> 36:51.251
Mascha is my godchild.
I watched her grow up.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.298
She's a clever and brave girl.

36:57.465 --> 37:03.138
She always supported her father
during his political struggle.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.308
I was so happy
to see her in your country.

37:08.184 --> 37:09.728
In safety.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.816
And now...

37:22.031 --> 37:23.908
Please, excuse me.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.577
We understand.

37:27.746 --> 37:31.416
It would be an honor, as members
of the Border Protection Group 10,

37:31.666 --> 37:33.710
to bring Mascha back.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.336
Thank you so much.

37:42.594 --> 37:46.723
- So, what is this damn "Bunker"?
- You don't know what the "Bunker" is?

37:48.099 --> 37:50.226
How old are you?

37:53.021 --> 37:57.776
Heroin, cocaine, LSD, crystal meth, pot
and all the other tooth-rotting stuff.

37:57.984 --> 38:01.571
A fuck shack with party drugs.
If only her godfather knew.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.823
Back of the line!

38:08.328 --> 38:11.498
- Border Protection Group 10, my dear.
- Helga!

38:13.374 --> 38:15.335
Helga? ls there a Helga here?

38:18.004 --> 38:19.005
No?

38:22.175 --> 38:24.219
How many times
do I have to say I'm not Helga?

38:24.469 --> 38:27.597
Your behavior undermines
my authority as an agent.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.975
- You mean "lady agent".
- Watch it, now.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.866
Mr. Steiner?

38:47.951 --> 38:49.744
Mr. Steiner?

38:55.667 --> 38:57.627
What are you doing here?

38:58.169 --> 39:00.046
It's no big deal. Mom knows.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.091
Oh, really? Let's ask her then.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.235
What's that? Your school ID?

39:23.444 --> 39:25.905
This will wipe that smile off your face.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.120
The rise is 12...

39:32.370 --> 39:35.123
and the run is 14.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.837
Conclusion: the stairs are too narrow.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.006
These are dwarf stairs.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.971
I'd like to talk
to the owner at once.

39:51.347 --> 39:52.599
Boss.

40:01.691 --> 40:06.446
- You have a problem with my stairs?
- In this case, I'll make an exception.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.032
A tiny exception.

40:14.662 --> 40:19.042
You let her go to her friend Michelle's
so they can study together?

40:19.626 --> 40:21.377
Thanks.Bye.

40:22.462 --> 40:25.924
Do I really have to give you a talk
about keeping promises?

40:26.090 --> 40:27.884
No. You know nothing about that.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.928
- Michelle!
- Here.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.221
You two, beat it.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.266
What's this?

40:35.516 --> 40:37.894
- My boyfriend.
- Don't you mean "friend"?

40:38.061 --> 40:39.687
- Yes.
- No.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.482
- Have you touched my daughter?
- No.

40:42.732 --> 40:45.777
- Dad...
- I smell a lie.

40:45.902 --> 40:49.614
- I don't smell anything.
- You're a sweet little guy.

40:49.906 --> 40:53.910
The guys in preventive detention
will be very happy to meet you.

40:54.077 --> 40:56.329
The guys in
preventive detention? Really?

40:56.621 --> 41:01.042
Can't you be cool for once? It's my
first time here and you're freaking out.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.169
Is everything okay, Ella?

41:04.295 --> 41:05.797
Yes.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.717
- How does this bum know your name?
- No idea.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.762
Stop bothering our regulars, you pedo.

41:14.847 --> 41:19.936
She's underage and if you ever allow her
in here again, I'll break your fingers.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.230
Go home and do your homework.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.024
Get out of here!

41:25.525 --> 41:27.568
You tell me where the control room is.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.698
I'll eat your little face,
Napoleon Dynamite.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.909
- Then scarf down the rest of you.
- "Hot Dog". "Hot Dog".

41:35.159 --> 41:37.286
- "Hot Dog"!
<i>- I'll</i> kill you!

41:37.495 --> 41:39.163
I hate your film, Napoleon!

41:42.333 --> 41:44.210
Evening. I need the hard disks.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.649
Hold him up, Kevin.
I want to have some fun.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.911
Mr. Steiner, there's something...

42:19.662 --> 42:21.372
Get down, Lilliputian.

42:21.664 --> 42:25.043
Fuck you, Kojak!
I'm going to bite your ugly face off.

42:29.464 --> 42:30.882
Come. Let's go.

42:31.716 --> 42:36.262
- I can't believe you assaulted a dwarf.
- The little guy wanted to eat my face.

42:36.429 --> 42:40.850
- That's no reason to break his nose.
- It was only a tiny nose.

42:40.975 --> 42:45.438
And you shouldn't say "dwarf".
It's offensive and discriminating.

42:46.647 --> 42:48.483
You're correcting me?

42:50.318 --> 42:52.153
Dwarf! Dwarf! Dwarf!

42:52.320 --> 42:54.572
- My mother is a little person.
- What?

42:54.822 --> 42:58.493
I used to cry as a kid
when people called her "dwarf".

43:00.536 --> 43:02.830
Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.917
I... I'm... I'm so terribly sorry.

43:06.459 --> 43:09.253
You're such an idiot.

43:10.088 --> 43:13.424
- Was that a lie?
- Here you go. The hard disk.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.889
You perform well
in dangerous situations,

43:20.098 --> 43:22.391
but your impulse control needs work.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.268
Who cares?

43:24.519 --> 43:28.147
Statistically, you have the highest
success rate in armed conflicts.

43:28.356 --> 43:31.109
But you also have
the most disciplinary actions.

43:31.359 --> 43:34.654
You were even forced to attend
an anti-aggression training,

43:34.904 --> 43:36.531
which was cancelled after ten minutes

43:36.739 --> 43:39.992
when you got into a fight
with six of the eight participants.

43:40.243 --> 43:44.247
- Pass me the map.
- The map? Yes.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.291
Here.

43:47.917 --> 43:50.086
Not that one! The atlas.

43:50.253 --> 43:52.088
Oh, the atlas.

43:52.338 --> 43:53.881
The atlas.

43:55.675 --> 44:00.304
I'm not aggressive. I've just been
in a bad mood for the last 20 years.

44:03.891 --> 44:06.978
That's unusual.
The tapes are all encoded.

44:07.228 --> 44:09.522
- Then decode them.
- I can't.

44:09.772 --> 44:11.899
Then find someone who can.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.741
So? Can you fix it or not?

44:22.201 --> 44:24.370
It's not broken, just coded.

44:24.620 --> 44:28.040
- Yeah, coded.
- ls being a smart-ass contagious?

44:28.291 --> 44:32.545
They're using a hybrid of
symmetrical and asymmetrical encryption.

44:32.753 --> 44:35.923
Way too elaborate
for a normal surveillance camera.

44:36.799 --> 44:40.261
Is what we're doing here
actually legal?

44:40.511 --> 44:42.388
It's our only lead.

44:42.555 --> 44:45.057
If not, I could call headquarters so...

44:45.308 --> 44:47.393
If you crack it, then...

44:49.729 --> 44:52.523
Then he'll kiss you,
tongue and all. Okay?

44:53.232 --> 44:54.609
No, it is not okay!

44:54.859 --> 44:58.196
- Any self-respecting woman would say...
- Okay.

45:03.034 --> 45:05.494
<i>It'll take all night.
You can crash here.</i>

45:09.624 --> 45:11.000
What the hell?

45:15.588 --> 45:18.966
Are you comfy, Mr. Steiner?
It's quite hard down here.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.470
It's quite hard without a mattress.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.555
The chick has the hots for you.

45:28.601 --> 45:30.228
No, we're just friends.

45:30.478 --> 45:33.439
You can sleep with your friends
if they're hot.

45:33.606 --> 45:37.568
She's not hot. Nicki is one of
the best hackers of her generation.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.321
I doubt that's her only talent.

45:42.281 --> 45:44.075
Check it out.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.537
I don't want to.

45:50.164 --> 45:51.207
Oops.

45:52.208 --> 45:56.879
Your degrading behavior towards women
is typical of men of your generation.

45:57.129 --> 46:00.299
At least men of my generation
had fun at your age.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.510
Yes, and STDs.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.348
Here you are.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.350
Practice on that.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.949
Barn! Mama's just good.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.037
Get up, you bum.

46:39.255 --> 46:40.715
Oh, no!

46:41.340 --> 46:43.009
I hope you used protection.

46:50.933 --> 46:54.645
Things aren't always as they seem.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.773
Things are usually as they seem.

46:59.942 --> 47:01.694
Who is she talking to?

47:03.362 --> 47:06.115
Boris Bohmann. They call him "Bobo".

47:06.324 --> 47:08.701
He had quite a criminal record
as a youth.

47:08.951 --> 47:13.748
After his release, he bought a farm
and has been off the radar ever since.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.375
How the hell does he know that?

47:16.542 --> 47:19.795
- He looks at mug shots when he's bored.
- No way.

47:20.046 --> 47:23.007
Wait. Play back
that image sequence again.

47:23.257 --> 47:25.718
- The entire evening?
- Play it at 18x speed.

47:25.968 --> 47:27.970
He just wants to show off now.

47:40.399 --> 47:41.400
Stop.

47:47.573 --> 47:50.326
That's the tattoo!
He's one of the kidnappers.

47:50.493 --> 47:51.827
Wow.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.622
I love your brain.

47:56.374 --> 47:59.335
- Are you sure?
- Yes! Photographic memory-sure.

47:59.794 --> 48:03.339
Were there any kids at school
who didn't run away from you?

48:03.631 --> 48:06.634
- Not a single one.
- Come on. Let's go.

48:07.426 --> 48:08.844
Okay.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.766
- Are you okay?
- I cracked the code.

48:13.933 --> 48:17.436
- Time for my kiss, tongue and all.
- I can't.

48:17.686 --> 48:19.480
- Why not?
- Because...

48:19.688 --> 48:23.526
- Something wrong with your tongue?
- No. We're colleagues.

48:24.151 --> 48:25.778
Intimate relationships...

48:29.490 --> 48:32.076
- It's a kiss, not an orgy. Come on.
- Wait!

48:33.035 --> 48:35.037
Besides, I'm...

48:36.205 --> 48:37.623
I'm already taken.

48:37.790 --> 48:39.708
- Who is it?
- I'm so sorry.

48:41.710 --> 48:43.754
He doesn't like to wait.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.383
Wait! Stop!

49:00.980 --> 49:03.732
- Let's go.
- This is a punishable offense.

49:03.899 --> 49:05.609
- So what?
- We're cops.

49:18.372 --> 49:21.584
- Oh, man, I'm not sure about this.
- Just open it.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.130
- Type in the damn code!
- Turn around.

49:26.797 --> 49:30.134
- Is it an ATM or something?
- I won't do it otherwise.

49:45.691 --> 49:48.027
Everything my heart desires.

49:51.906 --> 49:54.200
<i>The daughter of the Moldovan President,</i>

49:54.450 --> 49:59.413
<i>abducted before the very eyes of BPG 10
agents at the presidential residence,</i>

49:59.663 --> 50:02.583
<i>is still in the hands of her abductors.</i>

50:02.750 --> 50:05.711
<i>This security disgrace
is the first performance test</i>

50:05.878 --> 50:09.715
<i>for Arno Hedmann, the new head
of the Federal Criminal Police,</i>

50:09.965 --> 50:12.760
<i>who has barely held the position
for four weeks.</i>

50:14.678 --> 50:18.807
Boss? We have an unauthorized
removal of weapons in the armory.

50:19.892 --> 50:21.352
What's missing?

50:22.061 --> 50:23.812
Everything, actually.

50:24.438 --> 50:25.940
Who had access?

50:30.778 --> 50:34.240
Find Steiner.
I want him found and I want him crushed!

50:34.490 --> 50:37.493
I want him dead or alive. I don't care!

50:37.743 --> 50:41.080
I want those two morons found right now!

50:41.914 --> 50:43.332
I want those...

50:48.170 --> 50:50.047
Hey! Stop right there.

50:50.297 --> 50:52.132
What are you waiting for? Go!

50:53.634 --> 50:55.970
Shut the damn gate! Shut it!

50:56.762 --> 50:58.097
Stop! Stop!

51:01.433 --> 51:03.435
Stop! Stop! Stop them!

51:03.686 --> 51:06.397
Shit! Stop, I said! No!

51:11.819 --> 51:14.280
Those bums!

51:20.202 --> 51:23.038
What if Bobo
has nothing to do with the abduction?

51:23.247 --> 51:25.708
What if Bobo simply
cuts asparagus out there?

51:25.958 --> 51:27.626
Exactly.

51:27.876 --> 51:29.545
Yeah, keep making fun of me.

51:29.753 --> 51:32.798
And the guy with the tattoo
just happened to be there?

51:32.965 --> 51:35.634
No, I'm not giving him
a good social forecast.

51:36.135 --> 51:39.305
We're all going to jail.
We're going to jail!

51:39.763 --> 51:42.850
But it's okay.
We're driving to Brandenburg.

51:43.100 --> 51:46.228
- We're doomed.
- Brandenburg is awesome.

51:50.649 --> 51:54.695
- Why is it so dark all of a sudden?
- Because we're in Brandenburg.

51:57.156 --> 52:00.159
BOBO BOHMANN'S CATTLE RANCH
BRANDENBURG

52:08.876 --> 52:11.670
Harvesting asparagus
must be lucrative again.

52:15.591 --> 52:17.593
I need to stretch my legs.

52:18.427 --> 52:21.388
Hey! We're not
at a health spa concert evening!

52:21.597 --> 52:23.682
We don't stretch our legs.

52:25.351 --> 52:29.730
The chance of getting thrombosis
is 40% higher during long stakeouts.

52:29.938 --> 52:33.400
Don't forget your
compression socks next time, Helga.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.235
Why "Helga"?

52:35.986 --> 52:39.073
He behaves like my aunt
and looks like her, too.

52:39.239 --> 52:41.492
Your aunt must be
damn good-looking then.

52:41.659 --> 52:44.620
Feminizing your partner
by using female names...

52:44.787 --> 52:48.415
- We're not partners.
- ... Is a classic psychological pattern.

52:48.582 --> 52:51.001
Appreciation through degradation.

52:51.251 --> 52:55.798
The suppression of one's own failures by
over-emphasizing the mistakes of others.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.300
Pass me the flashlight.

53:00.052 --> 53:01.512
Okay.

53:02.513 --> 53:05.557
- There you go.
- Not that one! The bigger one.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.393
Oh, the bigger one.

53:08.310 --> 53:10.396
The bigger one. Here you are.

53:15.609 --> 53:19.363
It would appear
that Mr. Steiner is still mad at me

53:19.530 --> 53:22.241
for surrendering
to superior armed forces,

53:22.491 --> 53:26.745
while he was on a private call
with his daughter during the attack.

53:28.247 --> 53:29.707
Oh, yeah.

53:30.457 --> 53:33.335
Bobo breeds cattle.
Here's the ground plan.

53:35.587 --> 53:38.799
- What are those?
- Skylights. Looks like a cellar.

53:39.091 --> 53:40.801
If so, it's a damn big cellar.

53:45.013 --> 53:46.223
You stay here.

53:46.390 --> 53:49.768
Don't just play on your laptops.
Feel free to fool around.

54:03.031 --> 54:04.575
That was my chance.

54:06.368 --> 54:07.953
Chance for what?

54:08.495 --> 54:10.456
To prove that I can do it.

54:11.457 --> 54:14.501
And that I'm not the weirdo
they all think I am.

54:18.213 --> 54:19.965
Not all of them.

54:29.183 --> 54:31.894
Okay, there are three possibilities.

54:32.561 --> 54:34.188
- A: You're shy.
- I'm not shy.

54:34.438 --> 54:37.858
- B: You don't know how it's done.
- How what's done?

54:45.991 --> 54:49.328
C: You're gay and into Steiner.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.747
And that's fine.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.042
I am not gay.

54:55.834 --> 54:59.379
- You shouldn't feel ashamed.
- But I am not g...

55:03.300 --> 55:04.676
I love Mascha.

55:14.937 --> 55:16.438
I didn't mean to...

55:17.231 --> 55:18.315
I...

55:19.399 --> 55:22.861
I'll go check on Steiner.
I'm sure he's already in trouble.

55:23.028 --> 55:24.613
My partner.

55:29.243 --> 55:31.829
Mr. Steiner? Mr. Steiner?

55:44.842 --> 55:45.968
Mr. Steiner?

55:48.387 --> 55:50.013
Mr. Steiner?

55:52.558 --> 55:53.559
Mr. Steiner!

55:55.477 --> 55:56.854
Mr. Steiner.

55:57.938 --> 55:59.481
Why not just go ring the doorbell?

55:59.731 --> 56:03.193
If you thought less about yourself
and more about your colleagues,

56:03.360 --> 56:06.363
then no one would have
to call out your name.

56:15.205 --> 56:16.707
Weapons boxes.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.710
A tissue.

56:20.919 --> 56:22.504
No tissues here.

56:22.754 --> 56:25.465
- What's our plan?
- Our plan? It goes like this.

56:25.757 --> 56:28.385
You'll go back to the car
and grab a chocolate bar,

56:28.552 --> 56:32.222
and I'll go in there and beat up Bobo
until he gives us Mascha.

56:32.514 --> 56:33.724
Sounds very clear.

56:33.974 --> 56:36.852
Except for point A, the chocolate,

56:37.686 --> 56:40.981
and lacking my own ideas
for storming the building, I agree.

56:41.148 --> 56:44.902
Who said anything about "agreeing"?
I make the decisions.

56:45.068 --> 56:47.029
We must improve
your team-working skills.

56:47.195 --> 56:50.365
Cow Number 661, 36.3 pounds, Frankfurt.

56:50.616 --> 56:53.994
- Okay.
- What cow weighs 36.3 pounds?

56:54.620 --> 56:57.664
The question is,
what on the cow weighs 16.5 kilos?

56:57.915 --> 57:01.710
- Fancy a doner kebab?
- Are you for real? I need meat!

57:01.835 --> 57:04.963
- With the works?
- Garlic sauce is my eau de toilette.

57:05.172 --> 57:07.466
- Come on, dude.
- Eau de toilette!

57:08.675 --> 57:10.093
With the works.

57:23.607 --> 57:24.691
Now?

57:24.942 --> 57:28.111
If you had to transport drugs
across the entire country,

57:28.278 --> 57:29.738
where would you hide them?

57:29.988 --> 57:33.116
- Somewhere no one would suspect?
- Exactly.

57:47.381 --> 57:49.424
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

57:49.675 --> 57:50.759
- Yes, yes.
- No, no.

57:51.051 --> 57:53.470
Mr. Steiner, why me?

57:53.679 --> 57:55.180
Because I'm your superior.

57:55.430 --> 57:58.600
- You're not my superior.
- You have longer arms.

57:58.767 --> 58:02.104
- I... No, I don't.
- Do it!

58:02.270 --> 58:03.355
Mr. Steiner...

58:05.691 --> 58:07.150
- Man!
- Go on.

58:07.401 --> 58:09.569
- Oh, man!
- Do it.

58:10.070 --> 58:11.113
Okay.

58:20.247 --> 58:22.165
Okay. Okay.

58:33.927 --> 58:37.472
- Aren't there gloves for such things?
- Like these ones?

58:40.183 --> 58:42.686
Mr. Steiner,
I think I've found something.

58:42.936 --> 58:45.230
- Good. Pull it out.
- I feel something.

58:45.397 --> 58:47.482
- Good.
- There's something.

58:52.279 --> 58:53.780
Fuck!

59:22.851 --> 59:25.437
That wasn't so bad, was it?

59:28.148 --> 59:29.775
It's so disgusting.

59:32.319 --> 59:33.737
Naughty Bobo.

59:37.699 --> 59:40.243
The place is like a fortress.

59:40.452 --> 59:42.829
Every fortress has a weak point.

59:54.841 --> 59:58.011
We don't know how many
armed people are in there.

59:58.261 --> 01:00:01.598
- So what?
- What if the danger grows exponentially?

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:04.059
Then we'll exponentially crush them.

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:17.447
Mr. Steiner, "Hot Dog"!

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.169
Bless you.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:39.970
"Mascha..."

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.349
"I love Mascha."

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.813
That stupid Moldovan cow.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.993
Where's your weapon?

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.080
- In the car.
- What? Why is your weapon in the car?

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:10.167
- It was a spontaneous decision.
- What?

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.628
What if they shoot at you?
Will you blabber them to death?

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:18.466
Armed conflicts can often be solved with
a de-escalating communication strategy.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.886
"Crisis prevention and Formation".

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.680
Robert M. Buttweber,
third edition, pages 14 to...

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.141
Could you get me the flashlight again?

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.896
- How stupid do you think I am?
- Do you want an honest answer to that?

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.857
Guys,
I think you need couples therapy.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:47.287
- How did you get up here?
- The fire escape?

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.080
It's way too dangerous.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:53.210
What could happen to me
with two such competent agents around?

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:57.214
She called us "agents".
Meaning both of us. One, two.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.619
- Mascha! Mascha!
- Leo!

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.500
- This is all my fault!
- She's right about that.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:37.712
You were at a dance. You couldn't
have known what they were planning.

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.006
Well, she didn't meet them
at bible study.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.467
- Nicki, she's in shock.
- So am I.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:47.389
No, she's right.
I was stupid. So incredibly stupid.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.809
Can't you chat later? We have to go.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:53.937
- I know the way.
- Down the fire escape...

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.148
She's completely nuts!

01:02:57.399 --> 01:03:00.318
Show some compassion.
Mascha is traumatized.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.821
- Theo!
- Can't you do what I say for once?

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.908
Mascha, we're the good guys!

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:10.578
Relationships formed under exceptional
circumstances have no future.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:15.709
Quite the opposite. A strong bond is
formed, which makes them inseparable.

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:18.503
- This isn't inseparable!
- Hello?

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.756
Mascha!

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:26.970
Mascha.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:36.730
Theo, Luke! Lovely to see you again.

01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:41.651
- Mascha.
- And you brought a friend along.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:49.326
<i>To our great pleasure,
as of a few minutes ago,</i>

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:55.457
<i>three BPG 10 agents
have become our additional hostages.</i>

01:03:55.665 --> 01:04:01.087
<i>Together with the President's daughter,
we see it as fair to double the ransom.</i>

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.089
<i>32 Million.</i>

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.893
You can't go back
to Mama and Papa yet.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.855
You have to be of use
to your godfather for a while longer.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:21.149
No!

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:25.987
Bobo?

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.655
No! No!

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.158
Mascha!

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:32.744
Mascha!

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.498
She's been a nervous person
since childhood.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:40.001
If you touch her I'll take away
your wheelchair, shrivel legs.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.337
What did you call me?

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.131
You cross-eyed? I'm talking to him.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:49.386
He doesn't mean it that way.
He's soft on the inside.

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:53.181
Don't worry.
I'm not taking it personally.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.643
So, what shall we do with you now?

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.353
How about a sack race?

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:01.731
A sack race!

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.280
I have a much better idea.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.410
Ta-dah!

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.956
How about rope hanging?

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:25.130
- Gentlemen, it's show time!
- Where's Nicki?

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.382
She'll make so many friends here.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:31.428
We're letting her
have some fun, before we...

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:33.346
You pigs!

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:38.309
You need a lot of money

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.105
if you want to topple
a pro-European, democratic government,

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:47.652
which also happens to be poisoning
our people with imported Western values.

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:52.824
- You want to shoot your own people?
- No. I'll have them shot.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:57.662
Well, it was lovely chatting with you,
but I've got my hands full.

01:05:57.912 --> 01:06:01.666
Our lovely Bobo
will look after you from now on.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.169
Mr. Steiner, it's the snake.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:07.046
I'm so scared.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:11.009
It's best
if you don't antagonize Mr. Bobo.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:13.595
You buffoons ruined my TV evening.

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:17.474
A fat slob like yourself
should get off the couch more often.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.728
Fat slob!

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.939
Mr. Steiner is only joking.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:28.193
Joking. You're not fat.
Not even a little bit.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:30.653
You must be big-boned.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.739
Or perhaps it's hypothyroidism?

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:36.451
Or it's congenital,
as your mother was...

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.708
<i>We've just been told
by the Department of the Interior</i>

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:47.253
<i>that the abduction of the daughter
of the President of Moldova</i>

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:49.964
<i>is connected with Lukas Steiner.</i>

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:54.511
<i>Investigation authorities
appear to have no leads</i>

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:57.055
<i>regarding the perpetrators' identities.</i>

01:06:57.222 --> 01:07:02.185
<i>It also appears
that the security forces' utter failure</i>

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:06.231
<i>is due to bad personnel choices
made by Chief Inspector Reiners,</i>

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.733
<i>who heads the department.</i>

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.820
Boss, the Interior Secretary
is on line three again.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:18.076
Want to hear a nice story?

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.538
My mother wanted me to work at a bank.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:24.374
Just like my cousin Helmut.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.335
He works at the bank.
He's always in a good mood.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.587
Do you understand?

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.173
If I were born again,

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.426
I'd also work at a bank.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.263
I'd work at a bank.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:49.857
- Where is he?
- Having breakfast. His hand hurts.

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:52.944
But he sends his regards
and says he'll be back.

01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.615
I don't want to die yet.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:00.910
You're old,
but I've got my entire life ahead of me.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:04.080
It looks like it'll be a short one.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.375
I don't want to die a virgin.

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:11.254
- A virgin? But you told me...
- I lied, okay?

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:19.511
Quit whining, man. I love you, okay?

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.765
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.897
No one's ever loved me.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.359
Other than my parents.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.237
<i>And Ruth.</i>

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.532
Your brother?

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.537
My guinea pig.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:53.630
Hey, we'll get out of here
without a scratch.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.591
Then I'll get you
a really nice date, okay?

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:02.596
- Really?
- No. We're probably going to die.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:06.559
At least I won't be alone
on Christmas Eve then.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.645
Besides, I know nothing about women.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:12.689
The only one I ever loved left me.

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:14.692
And my daughter left with her.

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:23.076
What's wrong now?

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.913
The story is so sad.
About your wife and daughter.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:31.209
Hey! We'll get out of here, okay?

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:33.419
Really?

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.048
- What are you doing?
- Make yourself heavy.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.390
I have to pee.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.810
I have to pee!

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:51.854
Excuse me?

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.024
Little girl bladder.

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:06.744
Then you'll have to help me.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:09.038
The button's a bit tricky,

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:11.416
but I'm not wearing any panties.

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.211
It's your lucky day, Sweetie.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.356
Bad things always happen
in corridors like these.

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:36.899
Shut up.

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:41.028
And now?

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:44.323
- Right. Right.
- Why right?

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:47.660
Because my brain never fails
and I know the floor plan.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.163
- Are you sure?
- Dead sure.

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:00.923
You said you knew the floor plan.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.427
I have trouble telling left from right.

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:08.431
Don't worry! We're police officers.

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:12.226
- Oops.
- Come on!

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:25.156
Really? Can't tell left from right?
ls there any quirk you don't have?

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.044
Thanks, Mr. Steiner.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.132
Man oh man, that was crazy.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:59.106
You're as good as dead, you fat cow.

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:03.194
I am not fat!

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:06.280
Whoa! Hey!

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:12.453
You're a very attractive,
likable man of small stature.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:16.082
I'm a woman working
in a male-dominated field.

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:18.751
We're outsiders.
We should work together.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:25.299
Oh, my God! I'm so happy to see you.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:26.843
So happy-

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:33.558
It would've taken years to pay for
the guns for the coup with drug money.

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:35.852
But with the ransom
for the stupid Germans,

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.981
we were able to buy weapons
worth 32 million euros in one go.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:43.860
And in three hours,
I'll be the President of Moldova.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.489
Nobody move,
and hands where I can see them.

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:50.825
Goddammit, put that thing away!

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:53.327
And why would I do that?

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:58.040
Crack is produced by mixing cocaine,
hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:02.712
The procedure is highly combustible,
meaning one spark and it all explodes.

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:07.216
Finally, someone
who paid attention in chemistry class.

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:19.353
Your piece.

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:23.357
I'd gladly hand over mine,
but I left it in the car on purpose,

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:27.987
to avoid unnecessary escalation
in a situation of conflict. See?

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.031
I am so sorry, Steiner.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:37.496
- Surprise.
- Are you crazy? You don't hit women!

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:40.041
You really haven't changed at all.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.418
Your superior was lovely enough

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.922
to task Mr. Hedmann
with handing over of the ransom.

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.924
What can I say, Steiner?

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.509
Some offers are too good to refuse.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.805
Good for you. And for us.
One less asshole for us to greet.

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:57.600
Does anyone else know you're here?

01:13:57.808 --> 01:14:01.103
The cops? The military?
The Federal Intelligence Service?

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:10.279
Bobo, first in the legs,
then the arms and then all the rest.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:13.324
Know what?
I always slept during chemistry.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.569
- Shit.
- Keys!

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.154
- Shit.
- The keys!

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:54.490
- They were here somewhere.
- "Were"?

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.201
- Somewhere...
- Where did you last see them?

01:14:57.451 --> 01:15:02.081
- That stupid question never helps!
- How can you forget such a thing?

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:05.376
Not every brain
is like a damn instant camera!

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.505
A log.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.675
Found them!

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:19.265
- Go after them! Get them!
- Come on!

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:22.101
Bring me their heads!

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:34.280
- We'll die!
- It's bulletproof, man!

01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:39.368
You can shoot all you want, you morons!

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:42.329
- Roll up the window.
- It's bullet...

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:57.845
There's a major fire caused by
an explosion at a farm in Brandenburg.

01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.180
Wonderful.

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:04.310
We located your car via satellite
close to the location of the explosion.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.147
I'm sure it was Steiner.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:13.194
Yeah... Unfortunately,
we've lost contact with the satellite.

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:18.407
Contacts come,
and contacts go...

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:21.786
And it would appear
that Hedmann has disappeared

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:24.914
with the 32-million-euro ransom.

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:28.375
Yeah, I'm sure he'll bring it back.

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:31.295
He's a Federal Criminal Police Officer.

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:39.303
You drove well for a woman.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:43.557
Thanks. Statistically, accident rates
are one third higher for men.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:46.519
True. My mom can back into
a parking space better than I can.

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:48.813
I'll take your word for it.

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:52.608
- She drove me to dodge ball practice.
- I'm sure you were good at it.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:55.611
- I was better at jazz dancing.
- Jazz dancing?

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:57.363
Yes! I was really flexible.

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.156
Truck!

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:06.413
Shit.

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:09.742
Oh, man!

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:13.754
I'm sorry.

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.256
So sorry.

01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:17.675
Theo?

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:19.885
Mr. Steiner?

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.221
Here.

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:44.326
- It's time for a new plan.
- What kind of a plan?

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:48.414
Strangers tortured us
and wanted to hang and shoot us.

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:52.042
And break our legs! The closing act
was nearly being blown up.

01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:53.419
Helga's back.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:01.468
If you want out,
the next bus comes in...

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:03.721
20 minutes.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:16.692
It's the truck with the weapons.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.030
Come on!

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.411
SWIECKO, POLISH BORDER

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:29.872
Think, Theo.
Where are they heading?

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.166
Easy.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:37.504
The only possible destination
for such an operation near the border

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:43.010
is an abandoned Russian airbase
the Red Army gave up when they withdrew.

01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:47.473
I find it incredibly hard
not to hit him at such times.

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:50.184
Those are eyelash extensions.

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:53.646
They can't be real.
Just like her breasts.

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:57.441
- Her breasts are real.
- How would you know?

01:18:57.608 --> 01:19:01.695
- I felt them when she gave me her shake.
- Could you pass me the jack?

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.924
JEZEWO AIRBASE

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.097
Jezewo.

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:41.110
What now?

01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:43.946
Now we make a house call.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.864
A house call?

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:49.326
They're not burnt out
security guys guarding Walmart.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:52.663
- They're elite soldiers.
- Just like me.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:57.793
"Just like me". Of course!
They're dozens, maybe hundreds!

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:00.170
Backing down, Helga?

01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:02.881
Would you cut the "Helga" bullshit?

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:06.468
I've put up with it long enough.
You're not alone. We're a team!

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:09.346
In a team, you look out for each other.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:13.142
You protect your partner's life
as if it were your own. Get it?

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:16.603
But we're the only family
you've got right now.

01:20:16.854 --> 01:20:19.356
Your own family
wants nothing to do with you.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:22.901
Okay, squeeze.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:27.573
Until I no longer breathe.
Go on. I'm not scared of death.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:31.035
If you happen to come by my grave,
you'll read the inscription:

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:32.619
"Here lies Theo Ransoff.

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:35.622
Hopeful candidate
for a leading position at the BPG 10.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.667
Murdered by
his former role model, Luke Steiner,

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:42.921
who couldn't cope with his wife
leaving him in his midlife crisis."

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:48.302
Mr. Steiner...

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:54.016
I think Theo is right.
We can't really do anything here.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:58.395
We should tell the Interior Secretary
or the authorities.

01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:01.106
The guns will be in the air by then.
And Mascha too.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.233
Okay, then do something!

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.778
Turn the lights on
if you get scared of the dark.

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:08.238
I'll let you know when I need a taxi.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:26.006
You shouldn't have said that
about his wife.

01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:27.466
But I was right.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:32.471
That's not the point. Some things you
keep to yourself, even if it's true.

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:36.100
I just know that not everything
in life can be calculated.

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:38.435
Or learned by heart.

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:43.232
Love is complicated.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:48.529
Sometimes you just have to believe
that you're doing the right thing.

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:51.115
Even if others don't agree.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:55.077
No need to worry.
Jezewo is a maximum-security site.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:58.705
He can't get in.
He'll be back in five minutes.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:05.772
Our troops
surrounded the capital this morning.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.983
No one gets in or out.

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:12.362
Once we airdrop the weapons
and our 50,000 men get their equipment,

01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:15.532
we can storm the parliament
and the seat of the President.

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:18.869
The regular army has nothing
to match our firepower.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:21.538
Moldova is yours, Mr. President.

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.708
I'm proud of you.

01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:28.337
Surprise.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:34.801
Don't even think about it.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:39.139
Bobo...

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.850
The brave prince
has come to the dragon's lair

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.936
to face the bad guys.

01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:46.688
- Just like in a fairytale.
- Yes.

01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:50.317
And we all know how cruel
those endings can be.

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:03.914
I never thought I'd sink so low,
but... "Hot Dog".

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.293
"Hot Dog".

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:12.256
- I have something on channel one.
- Hello? Mr. Steiner?

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.633
Please repeat.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.260
"Hot Dog".

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:20.055
- I don't understand. Once again.
- "Hot Dog".

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.309
"Hot Dog".

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:28.730
We can't understand you.
You're mumbling.

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:31.567
I don't get it. Did he say "Hot Shots"?

01:24:32.943 --> 01:24:34.111
"Hot Shots".

01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:37.281
Do you mean the film?
With Charlie Sheen?

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:40.158
Your hearing is so bad! "Hot Dog"!

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:42.744
- "Hot Dog"!
- "Hot Dog"?

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:45.914
- Did you mean "Hot Dog"?
- "Hot Dog"!

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:49.585
He said "Hot Dog"!

01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:57.384
Having a code word is a fantastic idea.

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:10.063
Step on it!

01:25:11.648 --> 01:25:13.317
Out of the way!

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:21.742
- What are you doing?
- They usually get out of the way.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.836
- What are you doing?
- I'm shielding you.

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.464
Would you do the same if I were a man?

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:38.675
Yes. Possibly.

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:42.971
- So unprofessional.
- I don't want you to get hurt.

01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:48.352
Such chauvinism impedes women's
progress in patriarchal structures.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.731
It may seem considerate, but it
actually just keeps us women down.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:58.153
Okay, I'll shoot
your friend first if you want.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.696
- Good!
- Then you.

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:02.449
- That's also good.
- No, it's not.

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:07.746
But if we survive this,
I want to tell our kids a great story

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:10.874
about when Mom and Dad first kissed.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.459
Mom and Dad? Kids?

01:26:23.762 --> 01:26:25.430
We'll knock them silly.

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:27.808
That's enough now.

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:43.490
Bulletproof! Step on it!

01:26:49.496 --> 01:26:51.623
Drive up right next to the plane.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.434
That won't even scratch it.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.562
It will if you have
the construction plans in your head.

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:16.565
"If you have the construction plans"...

01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:27.451
Done! It worked.

01:27:27.743 --> 01:27:29.828
- What's that?
- What's wrong?

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.830
The hatch is open.

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:39.838
Blerim, take off!

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.131
He'll make it.

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:50.140
Mr. Steiner.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:54.144
She kissed me.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:57.439
The relationship
between the sexes is an enigma.

01:27:58.857 --> 01:28:00.484
A mystery.

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:04.586
Anyone ever told you it's hard
to talk about feelings with you?

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:06.490
Get in line, Theo.

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:08.575
You said "Theo". "Theo"!

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:10.619
Yes, Helga.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.510
Mr. Hedmann!

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:36.144
- Come on! Come on!
- I can't.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.368
We're taking off!

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:56.832
Shit.

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:09.469
- On your knees, Steiner.
- Dream on.

01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:12.097
You just couldn't
stay out of it, could you?

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:15.100
Because of you,
my vacations are in Romania from now on.

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:18.353
- Great beaches there.
- On your knees, asshole!

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:20.355
Hemorrhoid eye!

01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:30.991
Mascha?

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.243
Mascha... I'm all Mascha-ed out.

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:36.538
As of today,
I'm the new First Lady, rat face.

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:39.249
- But, Mascha...
- "But Mascha".

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:42.043
You have no problem
overthrowing your father.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:45.589
How does it go?
"Good girls go to heaven,

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:48.258
but bad girls go everywhere."

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:51.011
Say "Goodbye, Mascha".

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:54.264
Goodbye, Mascha.

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.267
Oh, my God.

01:29:57.434 --> 01:30:01.855
Men who cry are like dogs
who lick their enemies' boots.

01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:05.066
- They need to be shot.
- Sorry, boy.

01:30:05.317 --> 01:30:08.570
Your new girlfriend
is the worst date since Eva Braun.

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:15.452
Hold onto me, Luke.

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:18.788
- What?
- You've never held me.

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:22.000
- This isn't the right time.
- Please.

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:25.462
Go on.
Give your girlfriend a goodbye kiss.

01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:36.890
Holy shit!

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.445
Turn the plane around, at once!

01:30:59.371 --> 01:31:01.414
Bring the guns in position!

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:06.544
Quick! They're coming back.

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.463
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:11.800
- Theo, get the bazooka!
- Will do.

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:14.177
Bitch!

01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:32.445
We'll attack again.

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:37.200
Boss, we've located your vehicle.

01:31:42.622 --> 01:31:45.000
Luke, how does this damn thing work?

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:47.210
- Luke!
- Aim and push the trigger.

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:56.261
That's your car. It looks intact.

01:31:57.887 --> 01:31:59.472
Not a scratch on it.

01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:13.319
You idiot. You're such a moron.

01:32:13.903 --> 01:32:19.492
Tell the lovely Steiner to bring it
back, wash it and put it in the garage.

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:23.371
Please.

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:27.208
Mr. Steiner, you have to shoot.

01:32:28.585 --> 01:32:30.587
- I can't see.
- What?

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:32.630
You don't need to.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:36.968
Here. You shoot and I'll navigate.

01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:44.267
- And now?
- A bit higher and to the left.

01:32:44.517 --> 01:32:46.061
Left or right?

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:49.397
- Left.
- Left is where the thumb's on the right.

01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:51.524
Then it's to the right.

01:32:52.942 --> 01:32:54.444
It's all under control.

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:13.922
That sounds like a bull's eye.

01:33:14.672 --> 01:33:16.549
Yes. I'm over here, Mr. Steiner.

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:21.763
I'll rip you to pieces.

01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:29.771
There's nothing like
the calm of the countryside.

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:56.756
- Dad!
- Merry Christmas, Sweetheart.

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:59.467
You look awful.

01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:02.470
I tried to put a pizza
into the microwave.

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:06.516
Pizza for Christmas?

01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:08.810
I like pizza.

01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:12.939
- It should be done soon.
- Don't you want to come in?

01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:17.026
- I don't want to impose. I just...
- Come in, Steiner.

01:34:17.277 --> 01:34:18.862
The present...

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:28.079
- What are you doing here?
- Your wife invited me.

01:34:28.621 --> 01:34:30.582
She's not my wife. She left me.

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:35.253
- She shouldn't have.
- That's what I think, too.

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:38.715
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:41.009
I've got an important appointment.

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:43.887
On Christmas Eve? Are you kidding me?

01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:46.097
Dad, leave Benno alone.

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:49.434
I just wanted to wish
your boyfriend a Merry Christmas.

01:34:49.726 --> 01:34:51.019
Come here.

01:34:53.313 --> 01:34:58.067
If you hurt her, I'll get rid of you
and make it look like an accident.

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:00.069
Got it?

01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:04.324
Benno.

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:21.007
- Do you like them?
- Is this for real?

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.509
They're super stylish.

01:35:24.177 --> 01:35:27.764
- Why did you buy two pairs?
- One pair is for Mom.

01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:32.352
In 18 years,
you never knew my shoe size.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.187
I did. Size 12.

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:38.149
- Size 7.
- You could wear matching outfits.

01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:39.776
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:43.196
- We'll go to the "Bunker" together.
- Great idea.

01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:46.491
Out of the question.
I'll take them back and exchange them.

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:48.952
- Chill out, Dad.
- I will.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.497
- Tomorrow's a holiday.
- Then we can all sleep in.

01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:55.833
Does that mean...
I can spend the night here?

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.920
If you can find space
next to the giant feet.

01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:00.672
Me, too?

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:12.141
Congratulations.

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:17.021
<i>It's true what they say.</i>

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:19.607
<i>48 hours can change your life.</i>

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:25.113
<i>They lied to us,
beat us up and shot at us.</i>

01:36:25.863 --> 01:36:30.076
My son. I'm proud of you.

01:36:30.243 --> 01:36:34.080
<i>They suspended us, caused
an asthma attack and made fun of us.</i>

01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:38.376
<i>They tried to divide us.
To make us doubt ourselves.</i>

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.712
<i>But in one respect
we had a leg up on them.</i>

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.256
<i>We became friends.</i>

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:49.637
<i>Love is strange
and you never know where you'll find it.</i>

01:36:49.929 --> 01:36:53.599
<i>But that's what makes
the whole thing so exciting.</i>

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:10.533
<i>2</i> MONTHS LATER

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:24.172
Are we relaxing in our cushy job here?

01:37:24.422 --> 01:37:27.759
- What are you doing here?
- Paying you a visit.

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:32.138
- How's your new partner?
- We're not partners.

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:35.600
He's a vegetarian.

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:38.853
Our code word is "Veggie Rice".

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:42.690
"Veggie Rice"?
That's way cooler than "Hot Dog".

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.985
- You didn't even want one.
- How are you doing here?

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:49.739
Well, after all that excitement...

01:37:50.907 --> 01:37:53.076
rm quite happy here.

01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:57.789
Well, good thing we talked,
because Reiners wanted to transfer you.

01:37:58.039 --> 01:38:02.043
A position opened up,
but now that I hear you're happy here,

01:38:02.835 --> 01:38:07.131
all I have to say is,
"Bye Helga, and greetings to your mom".

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:11.344
- Luke.
- Yes?

01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:14.847
Don't make me worm it out of you.
What's the position?

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:17.392
He wants to transfer you to the front.

01:38:18.768 --> 01:38:22.688
- No way!
- It's the truth. But it won't be easy.

01:38:22.855 --> 01:38:25.983
Your predecessor
was an exceptional police officer.

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:29.987
- What happened to him?
- He's doing things he doesn't like.

01:38:30.154 --> 01:38:33.199
But that way he has
lots of time for the person he loves.

01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:35.910
So he's moving up a grade.

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:39.247
- A paper-pusher in love.
- Who won't be shot at.

01:38:39.455 --> 01:38:42.375
And he'll have time
for the important things in life.

01:38:42.625 --> 01:38:45.002
- I bet his ex is happy.
- He hopes so, too.

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:49.173
They went out a couple of times
and he says it's going well.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:55.304
- You're a "Helga" now, too.
- There can only be one Helga.

01:38:55.555 --> 01:38:57.140
Can I have your locker?

01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:00.017
I could be
"Luke Steiner, the next generation".

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:01.269
Luke 2.0.

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.397
I can't believe it!

01:39:06.983 --> 01:39:10.027
I can't believe it!
I'm the next Luke Steiner.

01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:11.737
Helga Steiner.

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:15.616
I have to call Nicki.
Can I tell her, or is it top secret?

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:18.661
- Helga, if you don't...
<i>- I'll</i> call my mom first.

01:39:18.828 --> 01:39:22.290
She'll go berserk.
My mother will go berserk.

01:39:27.295 --> 01:39:31.382
Ah! Where is the off switch?

01:39:49.066 --> 01:39:51.694
Know who you remind me of?

01:39:52.195 --> 01:39:54.405
My aunt Helga.

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:59.387
Oh, man!

01:41:02.848 --> 01:41:05.226
Would you like a sweet?

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:28.833
Wow! I'm loving it.

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:46.809
Keep blowing. Yes...

01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:53.399
Stop it. Stop it now. Come on.

01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:57.778
Keep blowing.
Blow more. Blow more!

01:41:58.821 --> 01:42:01.866
Will you just blow?
Yes! Come on.

01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:23.638
I'll get wrinkles on my face.

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:25.931
I have to shit
as aesthetically as Matthias.

01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:27.850
It just sneaks up on you.

01:42:49.246 --> 01:42:51.123
Shit. I can't do it.

01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:53.376
I'm sorry. It's...

01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:57.296
It's not easy. Once more...

01:43:01.258 --> 01:43:06.472
Mr. Steiner!
He wants to eat my penis!

01:43:18.818 --> 01:43:22.822
You're so quick-witted, Mr. Steiner.

01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:37.360
I look like Frodo
from "The Lord of the Rings".

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:41.173
When he got all excited
because of the... Yeah, okay.

01:43:41.298 --> 01:43:43.843
Can we have another take?
Okay.

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:19.003
I've forgotten my lines,
because I was so happy for you.

01:44:31.223 --> 01:44:33.851
I'll make the joke, okay?

01:44:34.477 --> 01:44:37.813
At least men
of my generation had fun...

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:40.566
before they reached your age.
