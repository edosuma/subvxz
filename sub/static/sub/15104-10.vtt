Whoa! Stop! Stop!

00:04.438 --> 00:09.174

of "ice road truckers"...

Narrator: A decade
on thin ice...

00:13.414 --> 00:14.279
(rattling bumps)

00:14.281 --> 00:15.614

00:15.616 --> 00:16.882
(thumping rattles)

00:16.884 --> 00:18.684
narrator: Has all led to this.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.686
(drill whirs, rumbles)

00:21.188 --> 00:21.787
mark: We got water!

00:21.789 --> 00:23.255
Mark: I can't force you guys
to do this.

00:23.257 --> 00:27.493
Todd: This is where we find out
how thin the ice actually is.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.496
(ice cracking loudly)
- holly (bleep)!

00:33.934 --> 00:48.380

00:48.382 --> 01:00.726

01:05.466 --> 01:10.102
narrator: The season is racing
to a record early finish

01:10.271 --> 01:14.339
as el nino's wrath has wreaked
havoc throughout the north...

01:14.341 --> 01:15.641
(loud splashing)

01:15.643 --> 01:19.078
and virtually every trail
is shut down.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.250
But deep in remote ontario

01:25.252 --> 01:29.922
a giant convoy is rumbling
their way down a closed road

01:29.924 --> 01:32.524
and into ice road's history.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.960
(loud thumps)

01:34.962 --> 01:36.528
mark: (bleep).

01:36.530 --> 01:38.831
(thumping bangs)

01:38.833 --> 01:42.134
they weren't kiddin' when
they said it was closed.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.369
Narrator: Yesterday...

01:44.371 --> 01:45.504
- To north caribou?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.639
Well we heard that road
closed last week.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.941
Narrator: Mark kohaykewych
was presented

01:48.943 --> 01:52.277
with a one-of-a-kind opportunity

01:52.279 --> 01:55.180
to deliver a convoy
of last minute supplies

01:55.182 --> 01:57.382
to the town of north caribou,

01:57.384 --> 02:01.753
a closed 400 mile trail
to be opened up exclusively

02:01.755 --> 02:04.189
for the urgent mission.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.325
But the venture was
so massive...

02:06.327 --> 02:08.794
Mark: This is the biggest
challenge I've taken on

02:08.796 --> 02:10.295
in all my years
of business here.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.998
Narrator: In addition
to company top dog, todd dewey,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.067
and rookie, steph custance,

02:15.069 --> 02:18.003
the polar boss brought aboard
his rivals,

02:18.005 --> 02:20.372
darrell ward and lisa kelly.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.974
- I'm hoppin' in your truck,
darrell.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.443
Ah let's see if we can just bury
the hatchet and get this done.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.177
Darrell: Let's get it done.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.813
Steph: Hammer down.
Todd: Let's hit the road.
- Let's go.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.082
Steph: Oh! Oh my god!

02:30.084 --> 02:32.317
(loud crunching crash)

02:32.319 --> 02:33.152
todd: Okay, here we go.

02:33.154 --> 02:36.655
Narrator: And despite
conquering 200 brutal miles...

02:36.657 --> 02:37.623
Steph: (over radio) I'm good.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.425
I should be able
to get out from here.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.660
Narrator: The ground breaking
convoy

02:41.662 --> 02:46.598
still has over 200 mud-filled
miles yet to go.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.835
- Pretty epic.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.004
(tires crunch and rattle)

02:52.006 --> 02:55.440
- whoa! There's a hole there.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.776
(rapid beeping)

02:57.778 --> 02:59.344
what's going on?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.413
- I don't know my gauges
were just (bleep) up

03:01.415 --> 03:03.482
and all my lights came on.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.284
What the (bleep)?

03:05.286 --> 03:07.419
I smell some wiring.
(rapid beeping)

03:07.421 --> 03:10.756
- whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Darrell: Can you smell it?
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!

03:10.758 --> 03:13.258
(loud hissing)
- holy (bleep)!

03:13.260 --> 03:15.761
- What the (bleep) is burnin',
mark?

03:15.763 --> 03:16.428
Mark: Darrell! Darrell!

03:16.430 --> 03:19.298
Let's get the (bleep) out.
(coughing)
darrell: What's goin' on?

03:20.201 --> 03:21.099
Lisa: Oh my god!

03:21.101 --> 03:24.036
- (coughing violently)
darrell stop the (bleep) truck!

03:24.038 --> 03:27.472
(truck creaks)
(coughing violently)

03:27.841 --> 03:29.141
cameraman: What's happening?

03:29.143 --> 03:31.176
Lisa: Mark ran out! Jumped out!

03:31.178 --> 03:33.145
(truck rumbles loudly)

03:33.581 --> 03:36.248
mark: Stop, stop, stop!
Fire! Fire!

03:36.250 --> 03:38.850
- Holy (bleep) there's smoke
pouring out of the cab.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.520
- What's up? What'd you--
mark: I need a fire
extinguisher!

03:41.522 --> 03:43.822
- Right here, right here.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.657
- Darrell, stop the truck!

03:45.659 --> 03:47.459
(truck rumbles)

03:47.461 --> 03:50.262
(truck rumbles and creaks)

03:52.433 --> 03:54.066
darrell!

03:56.670 --> 03:58.403
- Holy (bleep)!

03:59.240 --> 04:01.440
- Darrell!

04:02.943 --> 04:04.543
(engine idles)

04:05.412 --> 04:06.144
cameraman: What's going on?

04:06.146 --> 04:10.582
- (bleep) I got fire in my cab.
I got somethin' burning up.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.783
- Son of a bitch.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.151
(door shuts)
(engine rumbles)

04:13.153 --> 04:14.586
- got it!

04:14.588 --> 04:17.589
Darrell: I got one.
(extinguisher whooshes)

04:17.591 --> 04:20.158
- what the (bleep), man?

04:21.028 --> 04:23.262
(extinguisher whooshes)

04:23.264 --> 04:24.329
- holy (bleep) what's going on?

04:24.331 --> 04:26.231
- Back up, guys.
- You guys all right?

04:26.233 --> 04:29.368
- I got something burnin'
in my dash.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.606
I found some burnt wires, mark.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.142
Mark: Is that all it was?

04:37.144 --> 04:39.778
- Well, evidently. Shorted out.

04:39.780 --> 04:44.249
Narrator: A short in the
dashboard wiring caused a fire.

04:44.251 --> 04:47.452
Luckily an easy fix for mark.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.421
- Here get out of the way
I gotta get in there.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.789
Darrell: Have at it.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.791
Mark: We'll get it all back
together.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.493
Narrator: With some quick patch
work,

04:54.495 --> 04:57.429
darrell's truck will
be back in business.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.363
- Listen I know I work
for mark,

04:58.365 --> 04:59.631
but don't let him do the wiring
whatever you do.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.934
You're gonna have another fire
down the road.
- Shut up, todd!

05:02.936 --> 05:04.970
- (laughing)
- whose team are you on?

05:04.972 --> 05:08.206
- (bleep) guy jumps and opens
the door and bails out...
- Hey!

05:08.208 --> 05:12.010
Darrell: And worries about me
running over--
- darrell! Hey darrell!

05:12.012 --> 05:13.578
- But you know when
he bailed out

05:13.580 --> 05:15.180
I thought this
is an opportunity.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.448
- (laughing)
mark: Darrell!

05:16.450 --> 05:19.551
Shut up and start your truck!

05:20.421 --> 05:22.487
(door shuts)
start it.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.991
(engine starts up) see?
There you go. You got gauges?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.059
- Well, it was-
it was running before.

05:27.061 --> 05:30.595
- By the sound if it I swear
these two have been married
for 70 years.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.631
Lisa and steph: (laughing)

05:33.267 --> 05:35.434
darrell: All right let's see
if you've fixed (bleep) right

05:35.436 --> 05:39.004
or if it's all (bleep)
and (bleep) up.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.505
(truck rumbles)

05:40.507 --> 05:44.443
- okay, boys, here we go.
We're finally back to rolling.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.479
Narrator: Finally the convoy's
back on the road.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.648
- Thanks for, uh, settling
your differences up there

05:49.650 --> 05:52.217
(over radio) and gettin' that
fire put out.

05:52.219 --> 05:55.087
- Yeah, there's a lot of
(bleep) smoke coming out
of some ears in here.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.223
- Oh, enough.
- (laughing) okay.

05:58.726 --> 06:02.661
Narrator: But the toughest
stretches of the trail
is still ahead of 'em.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.329
(horn blares)

06:04.331 --> 06:06.465
- hammer down.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.603
Narrator: While the convoy
moves ahead,

06:13.307 --> 06:15.841
200 miles to the north,

06:16.310 --> 06:20.045
in the remote village
of sachigo lake...

06:20.047 --> 06:22.514
Art: So we're (bleep).
(liquid pouring)

06:22.516 --> 06:24.750
everything in there is (bleep).
(liquid pouring)

06:24.752 --> 06:28.687
narrator: Polar driver,
art burke, ain't goin' nowhere.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.721
(hood creaks and bangs)

06:29.723 --> 06:31.790
art: The radiator
is hangin' off,

06:31.792 --> 06:35.427
the fan is all smashed to hell,
the scrod is broke,

06:35.429 --> 06:37.295
all that bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang,

06:37.297 --> 06:39.898
the old truck couldn't take it.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.266
Narrator: On the way in...

06:41.268 --> 06:43.301
(loud splashing thuds)

06:43.303 --> 06:45.270
(loud thud)

06:45.539 --> 06:48.974
(splashing thud)
- holy (bleep).

06:49.176 --> 06:50.976
Narrator: Art and his rig
took a beating

06:50.978 --> 06:53.545
over the 300 mile trail,

06:54.181 --> 06:56.848
and on the route's mammoth
crossing...

06:56.850 --> 06:59.017
- I'm not sure what the (bleep)
is goin' on here,

06:59.019 --> 07:01.486
but I think we're afire.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.087
Oh, (bleep)!

07:02.089 --> 07:06.057
Narrator: The truck's fan and
radiator ultimately gave out.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.126
(hood creaks and clanks)
(truck rumbles and squeaks)

07:08.128 --> 07:10.929
art: We're off the (bleep) ice
anyway b'y. (ice cracking)

07:10.931 --> 07:13.832
narrator: And he barely limped
his way off the ice

07:13.834 --> 07:15.734
and into town.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.104
(truck squeaking)
art: I'm gonna get as far
as I can, b'y.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.939
Narrator: But now there's
no possibility

07:20.941 --> 07:23.575
the truck can last
another mile,

07:23.577 --> 07:26.545
let alone the trip back
to winnipeg.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.113
(liquid pouring)

07:28.115 --> 07:33.251
- that's the way she goes, b'y.
There's nothing I can do.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.156
(truck horn toots)

07:38.158 --> 07:38.924
(truck rumbles)

07:38.926 --> 07:43.161
alex: There's art.
What the heck's goin' on?

07:43.163 --> 07:46.398
Narrator: But the wild card's
got his ride home.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.769
Art: Thank you, thank (bleep).

07:50.771 --> 07:52.404
- (laughing)

07:52.406 --> 07:56.374
narrator: As alex debogorski
finally arrives...

07:57.578 --> 08:01.580
After choosing to take
the longer route to town.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.080
(thumping bangs)

08:02.082 --> 08:05.550
alex: Might take forever to get
there because it's so rough.

08:05.552 --> 08:08.320
- How's she going, b'y?
- What's happened?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.889
- Good to see you and
all that (bleep) jazz.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.224
Road was (bleep) rough, eh?

08:12.226 --> 08:14.125
- Yes. What's the news?

08:14.127 --> 08:17.562
- Well, my radiator's all
(bleep). Come and see.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.032
- What'd you do?
You wrecked it?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.634
- All the (bleep) fluid run out.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.369
There's the screen off
of that (bleep) thing

08:24.371 --> 08:26.738
and all the top is beat off
the (bleep) radiator,

08:26.740 --> 08:30.041
the whole (bleep) nine yards
b'y. Fan went through it.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.110
All the scrod was (bleep) up.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.411
- The fan went through it?

08:33.413 --> 08:35.280
Holy mackerel!

08:35.282 --> 08:37.883
Art: You gotta get me
outta here.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.187
(chuckling)
how do you like that?

08:42.189 --> 08:45.123
Well, alex just landed here
and I laid the news on him

08:45.125 --> 08:49.628
and he's taking me back
on the back of his truck.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.962
What can I say, eh?

08:50.964 --> 08:53.265
- Good. At least you got here.

08:53.267 --> 08:53.965
- (laughing)

08:53.967 --> 08:57.235
alex: So once I'm unloaded
this van is gonna stay here

08:57.237 --> 09:00.038
and art's truck is gonna
go on my trailer.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.074
Narrator: Once the rig is
loaded onto alex's trailer,

09:03.076 --> 09:06.945
art will join the old pro
in the cab.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.080
- I'll see if I can keep mine
in one piece now.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.883
Narrator: But whether they can
make it over the destroyed trail

09:11.885 --> 09:16.087
hauling the 13 ton truck
is anybody's guess.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.256
Art: I've never driven in a cab
with alex.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.592
I imagine it'll be all right.
I can handle it.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.327
- It's not that bad.
(laughing)

09:22.329 --> 09:24.930
- it's the last, the last trip
anyway, buddy.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.601
Narrator: While the two
war horses hit the road,

09:31.705 --> 09:34.306
200 miles to the south...

09:35.676 --> 09:38.476
(trucks rumble and rattle)

09:39.179 --> 09:40.745
- yikes.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.014
- This road's (bleep) falling
apart. (loud rattling)

09:43.016 --> 09:45.817
narrator: The all star convoy
is still trudging ahead

09:45.819 --> 09:49.054
on the mud-filled road
to north caribou.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.690
- This isn't a road.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.991
This is not a road.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.459
- This is a (bleep) goat trail.

09:54.461 --> 09:57.762
Eff that, I don't even think
a goat'd walk on it.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.497
(truck rattles)

10:02.569 --> 10:04.803
- hey, is everybody all right
out there?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.338
- Yeah, right behind ya.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.073
(truck rumbles)

10:09.843 --> 10:12.444
- yep, 10-4, I'm right here.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.412
- Steph is out and rollin'.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.947
(truck rumbles)

10:16.516 --> 10:18.750
(loud thud)
woo!

10:18.752 --> 10:22.787
Narrator: The path has been
absolutely brutal.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.357
- Ah crap. Look at that.

10:27.594 --> 10:32.163
Narrator: But it's about to get
a whole lot tougher.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.166
- Ah this is, this is steep.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.570
Are you gonna make that
in this soft crap?

10:38.572 --> 10:40.171
(tires crunching)

10:40.173 --> 10:45.176
- guess we'll know when
we get to it, won't we?

10:46.613 --> 10:48.713
- We got a big hill here, guys,
so just, uh,

10:48.715 --> 10:50.348
keep your distance, please.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.950
We're gonna take a run
at it here

10:51.952 --> 10:53.518
(over radio) as best as we can.

10:53.520 --> 10:57.355
- That is a good sized hill.
Holy (bleep).

10:58.725 --> 10:59.758
Steph: We're comin' up to a big
hill here,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.826
but we're gonna have to stop
and let one truck at a time go

11:01.828 --> 11:05.397
because if darrell can't make
it he's gonna have to back down

11:05.399 --> 11:06.031
and get a good run at it

11:06.033 --> 11:07.966
so we're gonna give him
some space here

11:07.968 --> 11:09.701
and see what happens.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.203
Hopefully we can get up it.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.705
Narrator: The 15 percent grade

11:13.707 --> 11:17.042
would be a challenge
in the dead of winter,

11:17.044 --> 11:18.343
but in the warming temperatures

11:18.345 --> 11:22.814
it could be a potential trap
for the big rigs.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.883
- Okay, I'm rollin'.

11:28.488 --> 11:32.557
(engine rumbles loudly)
(chains clank)

11:36.163 --> 11:38.096
(gearshift clunks)

11:38.098 --> 11:39.931
(engine rattles and groans)

11:39.933 --> 11:42.100
- come on, come on.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.568
(engine roars)

11:43.570 --> 11:46.204
come on, darrell!
- It's (bleep) soft, mark.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.472
(engine rumbles loudly)

11:47.474 --> 11:50.508
- push it.
Darrell: I can only go so fast.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.576
(truck groans and strains)

11:51.578 --> 11:54.212
- yeah, your tires are sinkin'.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.880
(loud thud, truck groans)

11:55.882 --> 11:57.315
(loud thuds)

11:57.651 --> 12:00.318
(rattling bangs)
mark: (bleep)!

12:00.921 --> 12:03.421
(engine revs and groans)

12:04.157 --> 12:05.490
come on!

12:06.093 --> 12:07.592
Holy (bleep).

12:07.928 --> 12:10.862
(engine whines, tires whir)

12:12.199 --> 12:13.665
- (bleep)!

12:19.072 --> 12:23.141
Narrator: On the ragged trail
to north caribou...

12:23.977 --> 12:26.578
Narrator: Caked in mud
and thawing muskeg

12:26.580 --> 12:27.812
a 15 percent grade hill

12:27.814 --> 12:31.583
has proven too much for
the leader of the convoy.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.352
Todd: It's got too much mud on
it from the sun beating down.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.589
There ain't no way
they're gonna me it up it.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.791
- I'm gonna back down.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.826
It's so (bleep) soft
the (bleep) tire chains

12:41.828 --> 12:45.864
aren't gonna do me a bit
of (bleep) good, you know.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.632
(engine rumbles)

12:49.770 --> 12:52.137
- they're gonna have
to unload the loader.

12:52.139 --> 12:52.637
(door opens)

12:52.639 --> 12:55.340
narrator: To get up
the massive incline

12:55.342 --> 12:57.742
the trucks will need
extra muscle.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.111
(chain clanks)
mark: Thank goodness we got
this thing here.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.980
Hopefully we can push
the trucks up,

13:01.982 --> 13:03.281
take it from there.

13:03.283 --> 13:08.153
Narrator: So mark will use his
12 ton loader to push 'em over.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.754
(chains clank)

13:09.756 --> 13:13.258
these roads are closed,
nobodies out here,

13:14.027 --> 13:17.495
everybody (bleep) knew better
than to come out here,

13:17.497 --> 13:19.798
everybody but us, of course.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.968
Mark: If this doesn't work
I've let the community down,

13:23.970 --> 13:26.271
I've let my drivers down.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.241
- The more time that's wasted
on this road like this

13:30.243 --> 13:32.377
it's getting worse and worse
by the second.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.947
It's already down to dirt and
mud and the longer we sit here

13:35.949 --> 13:38.983
the deeper it's gonna thaw down
the deeper it's gonna get,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.586
the farther the tires
are gonna sink.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.389
Narrator: With the fate
of the mission on the line

13:44.391 --> 13:47.525
mark ready's the loader
for battle.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.994
(door shuts)

13:49.996 --> 13:51.029
- darrell, you copy?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.031
- Okay, I'm ready whenever
you are.

13:53.033 --> 13:56.100
- All right,
we're gonna move in.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.903
Three, two, one, let's go.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.439
(metal grinding)

14:02.943 --> 14:06.611
(engine revs)
(truck rattles loudly)

14:06.613 --> 14:07.812
come on let's go, let's go.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.448
- I'm givin' her what I can,
mark.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.317
(chains clanking)

14:13.553 --> 14:14.552
todd: Up they go up the hill.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.488
If you dig the ruts down
in deep none of us are gonna
get over it.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.890
The loader's gonna dig down
in deep too

14:18.892 --> 14:21.292
and then we're all gonna
be stuck here.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.560
(engines rumbling)

14:22.562 --> 14:24.662
- looking good, bud,
we're almost there!

14:24.664 --> 14:26.764
- Yeah, come on, push, push.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.334
(truck and loader grind)

14:31.605 --> 14:33.371
all right, I got her, buddy.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.874
Narrator: Darrell's made
it over the top.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.675
- All right, lisa,
let's give her.

14:37.677 --> 14:42.080
Narrator: But the rest of the
troop's need an added boost too.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.449
(metallic thump)

14:44.451 --> 14:45.917
- don't let me sink.

14:45.919 --> 14:49.320
(chains rattle and clank)
(loader rumbles)

14:50.757 --> 14:52.290
thank you.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.894
- All right who's next?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.863
(loud clanking thump)

14:59.933 --> 15:00.965
- is that okay for speed, mark?

15:00.967 --> 15:04.002
- That's excellent. Don't spin
out, you're doin' good.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.939
Narrator: Each trip the loader
pushes a truck up the hill...

15:07.941 --> 15:10.909
- The worst is coming.
Keep going, keep going
(over radio) keep going!

15:10.911 --> 15:12.277
- Steady, steady, steady.

15:12.279 --> 15:16.881
Narrator: The more the road
gets torn apart.

15:16.883 --> 15:17.348
(horn honks)

15:17.350 --> 15:19.284
steph: Yeah!
Mark: (over radio) good job.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.986
- We did it, boss man.
Thank you kindly.

15:21.988 --> 15:25.456
Narrator: So for todd and
his heavy 22 ton haul...

15:25.458 --> 15:27.458
Mark: All right, todd,
you're next, buddy.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.327
- All right, I'm ready for you,
buddy.

15:29.329 --> 15:33.064
Narrator: The last run up the
incline will be the hardest.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.634
Mark: (over radio) three, two,
one. (loud clank)

15:36.636 --> 15:38.503
todd: Here we go.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.372
(engines rumbling)

15:51.351 --> 15:53.685
this one's gonna be rough!

15:54.220 --> 15:55.753
(engine whirring)

15:55.755 --> 15:58.289
(loader rumbles loudly)

15:58.959 --> 16:00.458
oh, my goodness sakes.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.527
(loud clattering thuds)

16:03.163 --> 16:04.629
oh, damn it!

16:05.365 --> 16:06.864
(engine revs)

16:07.200 --> 16:09.767
come on, you son of a bitch.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.803
(truck grinds and strains)

16:11.805 --> 16:12.870
(truck groans)

16:13.907 --> 16:15.306
(loud thud)

16:15.308 --> 16:18.242
come on, get me outta here.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.112
(rattling thuds)

16:21.114 --> 16:22.647
(engines rumble and whir)

16:22.649 --> 16:24.749
mark: (over radio) you let
me know when you're free.

16:24.751 --> 16:29.320
- Almost, about ten more feet
I think I'll have her.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.122
(loader grinds)

16:32.158 --> 16:34.058
yee-haw!

16:36.997 --> 16:38.563
(horn honks)

16:38.965 --> 16:40.498
- yeah, right on, we made it!

16:40.500 --> 16:41.933
Woo! Good job, guys.

16:41.935 --> 16:42.800
- All right let's get that
loader

16:42.802 --> 16:46.304
and get it back on this trailer
and get outta here.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.174
Narrator: With the hill
conquered by the polar boss

16:50.176 --> 16:52.343
and all-star team...

16:52.345 --> 16:53.845
(engine whirs)
- you're good.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.146
- I wasn't sure we'd be able
to do it,

16:55.148 --> 16:56.514
but you know what,
we got it done.

16:56.516 --> 17:01.252
Narrator: It's time to bear
down for the final 150 miles.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.920
Darrell: We're up the hill,
let's move on.

17:02.922 --> 17:06.891
This ground ain't gonna
hold up long.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.227
(door shuts)
(trucks rumble)

17:09.229 --> 17:12.397
mark: Let's just see what other
challenges we got ahead of us,

17:12.399 --> 17:15.266
but I know the worst
is yet to come.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.070
Narrator: 90 miles to the north,

17:19.672 --> 17:22.940
on the path out
of sachigo lake...

17:23.543 --> 17:25.843
- Oh-oh-oh baby.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.278
- Oh my god.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.517
- (laughing)

17:32.519 --> 17:33.284
- (bleep) sake.

17:33.286 --> 17:37.321
Narrator: With art's broken
rig loaded onto alex's trailer

17:37.323 --> 17:42.060
the duo are hittin' the trail
back to winnipeg...

17:42.062 --> 17:44.162
- Ah.
- Oh, is right.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.365
There's one (bleep) show
after another, man.

17:47.367 --> 17:53.137
Narrator: But it won't be an
easy trip over the obliterated
400 mile route.

17:53.807 --> 17:55.339
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.

17:59.846 --> 18:04.048
Narrator: And even gettin' out
of town presents a challenge.

18:04.784 --> 18:05.416
Art: Stop right there.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.853
I don't know how the (bleep)
we're gonna do this.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.621
(airbrakes hiss)

18:10.857 --> 18:12.890
narrator: The truck's so tall
on the flat bed

18:12.892 --> 18:16.661
that it won't clear the wires
hanging over the road.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.364
- I'm gonna see if I can't push
that (bleep) wire up, buddy,

18:20.366 --> 18:22.433
so we can get by here.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.069
Alex: I knew we had a shovel
for something.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.872
Art: It's a long way from
standard (bleep) procedure.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.875
If it (bleep) kills me
I'm telling you I'll be back.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.811
I'll haunt the (bleep)
out of polar.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.115
Okay, pull her ahead, b'y.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.752
Alex: Okay!
Art: Nice and slow!

18:42.188 --> 18:45.156
Come on for (bleep) sake!
(engine rumbles)

18:45.158 --> 18:48.893
(metallic clank)
whoa! Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop!
(engine hisses)

18:48.895 --> 18:50.661
(metallic clank)

18:53.099 --> 18:56.100
okay! Whoa!
(engine hisses)

18:58.171 --> 19:00.304
(metallic clanks)

19:00.306 --> 19:02.073
okay!

19:04.477 --> 19:06.677
Go for (bleep) sake!

19:07.580 --> 19:10.581
(chains rattling)
(engine hisses)

19:11.384 --> 19:13.050
(wire whips)

19:14.454 --> 19:16.854
narrator: One line's
behind him...

19:17.824 --> 19:22.260
Art: Let's go b'y, I'll just
stay here for the next one.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.061
(engine hisses)

19:25.064 --> 19:27.131
alex: I'm just worried
if there's power in 'em.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.032
Art: The other one
was a guide wire.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.768
This is a little different
(bleep) ball game this (bleep).

19:30.770 --> 19:32.770
- This guy, this guy's got
power.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.673
Art: (bleep) right
he's got power.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.309
Alex: I don't really like
the idea of hittin' live wires.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.145
We don't need you gettin' blown
off the freakin top
of the truck...

19:41.147 --> 19:43.681
- Well that's-I'm not real
impressed with that neither

19:43.683 --> 19:45.750
to tell you the (bleep) truth.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.888
Just slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.991
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

19:53.993 --> 19:56.527
(airbrakes hiss, idles)

19:57.130 --> 19:59.197
okay, right there.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.033
Alex: Art's gonna give me
a heart attack.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.770
Oh, that wooden broom's better
than what you had there,
aluminum.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.639
Art: Yeah. Okay, alex buddy.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.042
Alex: Don't fall down!

20:15.048 --> 20:17.682
(door shuts)

20:17.684 --> 20:19.450
(engine grinds)

20:24.324 --> 20:28.926
art: Whoa-wh

20:29.796 --> 20:32.363
alex: I don't really like
tart: Whoa! Whoa! Stop! Stop!.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.566
(truck groans, wires whipping)

20:40.673 --> 20:44.342
- I think we're okay.
Where is he?

20:50.416 --> 20:51.949
Where's art?

20:55.855 --> 20:59.690
Art: (bleep) sometimes I hate
this (bleep) job!

20:59.692 --> 21:02.126
Alex: (laughing)

21:02.128 --> 21:02.760
everything's going good.

21:02.762 --> 21:06.664
Art's not dead so there wasn't
very much power in that line.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.399
(door shuts)

21:10.570 --> 21:12.003
art: Okay, buddy.

21:12.005 --> 21:14.972
Away we (bleep) go.
(door shuts)

21:15.508 --> 21:17.708
what a (bleep) joke.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.645
- Beautiful.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.982
Narrator: The wires are finally
in the rear view mirror.

21:25.218 --> 21:28.819
Alex: Oh, does this ever
look bad.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.823
Narrator: But with 400 miles
slush ahead of 'em

21:32.825 --> 21:35.326
the hard part's just beginning.

21:35.328 --> 21:39.196
(trailer creaks)
- oh my-my-my-my-my-
my-my-my-my-my-my.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.499
- (laughing)

21:41.768 --> 21:45.102
art: Beam me up, scottie,
for (bleep) sake.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.141
Narrator: 80 miles
to the south...

21:51.277 --> 21:53.010
(truck rumbles)

21:54.614 --> 21:57.581
(loud rattling thuds)
- whoa!

21:57.583 --> 21:59.517
(loud thuds and rattles)

21:59.519 --> 22:01.185
- unbelievable.

22:01.254 --> 22:03.621
Narrator: The giant convoy's
hunkering down

22:03.623 --> 22:07.692
on the final 100 miles
to north caribou.

22:07.694 --> 22:12.596
- This road just flat keeps
getting worse and worse
and worse.

22:12.598 --> 22:13.864
Narrator: But as warming
temperatures

22:13.866 --> 22:16.534
continue to destroy
the terrain,

22:16.536 --> 22:20.871
each mile is tougher and slower
than the last.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.574
- This is (bleep) up.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.875
- It's mine field of rocks.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.444
You don't wanna drive
over that stuff

22:26.446 --> 22:29.046
it'll break somethin' off.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.815
(big rattling bang)

22:30.817 --> 22:34.218
- ah!

22:34.220 --> 22:37.355
Like this is ridiculous.
It's no longer clay and mud

22:37.357 --> 22:39.757
it's just disgusting.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.426
(truck rattles and thuds)

22:44.530 --> 22:46.764
- (over radio) that's some
impressive driving you guys.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.667
Going through all that
mine field rock.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.802
- Nice team work, guys.

22:51.804 --> 22:52.670
- All right.

22:52.672 --> 22:57.274
Narrator: But the biggest
hurdle of the entire trail
is next up.

22:57.276 --> 23:00.444
- Just got to get this ice
crossin' out of the way.

23:02.782 --> 23:03.981
Todd: Wow.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.017
(truck rattles)

23:07.019 --> 23:08.619
- look at this water.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.888
- The whole lake is flooded.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.723
(truck squeaks to a stop)
- holy smokes.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.893
Narrator: The road had been
closed and was opened up

23:15.895 --> 23:18.362
exclusively for the convoy,

23:18.364 --> 23:23.601
so it's a guessing game if the
crossing is safe for travel.

23:23.603 --> 23:27.004
- All right, darrell,
let's do this.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.606
(chains clank)

23:28.608 --> 23:31.742
narrator: To test the thickness
of the ice...

23:31.744 --> 23:33.544
- Ah, I think I got her.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.845
- Everybody's loaded

23:34.847 --> 23:36.714
and there ain't nobody going
across that ice

23:36.716 --> 23:37.681
till it gets drilled
with an auger

23:37.683 --> 23:39.550
to make sure that the thickness
is gonna hold up

23:39.552 --> 23:40.651
the weight of these trucks.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.854
Narrator: The team will drill
a hole with an auger.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.356
And who knows if that ice
ain't thick enough

23:45.358 --> 23:47.458
we could be turning around
and going back,

23:47.460 --> 23:49.894
and nobody's making it in.

23:49.896 --> 23:53.798
- So poke a hole and see
what we got.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.834
(motor whirs)

23:57.737 --> 23:59.637
(loud drilling)

24:08.347 --> 24:10.481
mark: We got water!

24:11.684 --> 24:15.052
Todd: That's not thick you guys.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.455
About a foot and a half.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.556
- Yeah, that's not very thick.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.991
You can look right in there
and see it.

24:21.194 --> 24:26.797
Narrator: Ice crossings
are usually two to three times
thicker than this one.

24:28.267 --> 24:31.202
Mark: At polar we got
a right to refuse work,

24:31.204 --> 24:33.571
so, I mean, if you guys feel
it's unsafe

24:33.573 --> 24:35.005
and you don't want to do it
I'm not -

24:35.007 --> 24:37.975
I can't force you guys
to do this.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.750
Narrator: On the road
to n(ice cracking).

24:48.421 --> 24:52.223
Darrell: It is what it is.
It's here, we got to go across.

24:52.225 --> 24:55.259
Todd: I didn't come all this
way to not deliver the load.

24:55.261 --> 25:00.364
So I'm willing to take
the chance.

25:00.366 --> 25:00.831
- We all in?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.766
Lisa: I'm in.
Todd: We're all in.
Lisa: I came this far.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.969
Todd: We're here.
Let's get it done.
Mark: Let's go.

25:04.971 --> 25:05.636
(chains clank)

25:05.638 --> 25:07.738
todd: You gonna unload
it right here, mark?

25:07.740 --> 25:09.006
Mark: I'm gonna take the loader
across.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.108
It's way too heavy
to go with the loader.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.910
(beeping)
- come on back a little.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.912
Narrator: To take every
added precaution,

25:14.914 --> 25:19.149
mark will alleviate some of the
weight off darrell's trailer.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.184
(chains clank)

25:20.186 --> 25:23.087
and now the total tally will
be five vehicles

25:23.089 --> 25:26.357
traveling across
the melting ice.

25:27.460 --> 25:31.028
Darrell: All right,
rock and roll!

25:32.632 --> 25:34.465
(door shuts)

25:34.467 --> 25:36.233
- (over radio) are we ready
to do this?

25:36.235 --> 25:38.636
- Come on, let's roll.

25:39.305 --> 25:43.073
- Sounds good.
- Let's get 'er done, mark.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.213
(engine rumbles)

25:51.484 --> 25:56.253
todd: This is where we find out
how thin the ice actually is.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.721
(nervous sigh)

25:57.723 --> 25:59.490
(ice cracking)

25:59.492 --> 26:02.459
- I'm gonna give him a safe
distance for a minute.

26:02.461 --> 26:04.094
(ice cracking)

26:08.801 --> 26:10.801
- (over radio) be very careful
comin' down.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.903
- I'm droppin' down, mark.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.774
Narrator: To ease the pressure
on the surface,

26:16.776 --> 26:21.545
the driver's will give each
other a safe distance.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.884
- It's definitely doin'
its cracking.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.519
(ice cracking)

26:30.089 --> 26:33.424
(loud cracking, water bubbling)

26:36.228 --> 26:41.332
- okay, I just dropped down
onto the ice.

26:41.334 --> 26:44.268
Mark: (over radio) you gotta
keep a real safe distance guys.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.873
- Look how brittle
this ice looks!

26:49.875 --> 26:54.578
Narrator: It's been days since
any truck has passed over
the crossing...

26:54.580 --> 27:00.484
And the ice has been subjected
to record high temperatures
ever since.

27:00.486 --> 27:01.185
(ice cracking and popping)

27:01.187 --> 27:03.387
- 'kay, steph, I think you
could drop down now

27:03.389 --> 27:04.922
but because it's so sketchy

27:04.924 --> 27:09.493
(over radio) just keep this
spacing and you should be good.

27:09.495 --> 27:10.160
- Okay, sounds good.

27:10.162 --> 27:13.364
(over radio) I'm gonna pull
my load across.

27:13.366 --> 27:15.132
(engine rumbles)

27:15.901 --> 27:17.334
okay, I'm on the ice.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.637
(ice cracking loudly)

27:19.805 --> 27:23.641
- it is (bleep) scary.
(nervous inhale)

27:23.643 --> 27:25.309
(ice cracking)

27:25.811 --> 27:27.144
todd: What we got goin'
on right now

27:27.146 --> 27:28.445
is the scariest ice crossings

27:28.447 --> 27:30.881
I think we've ever done
at polar.

27:30.883 --> 27:31.782
(ice cracking)

27:31.784 --> 27:34.318
- steph, how you doin'?

27:35.254 --> 27:36.754
- I'm scared.

27:37.456 --> 27:41.525
- Copy, copy, well as long as
you're still on top we're good.

27:41.527 --> 27:46.163
- Oh my god. I just want
to get off this ice.

27:46.766 --> 27:50.634
- I think steph's up there
far enough. Here we go.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.036
Narrator: At 22 tons,

27:52.038 --> 27:56.306
the last and heaviest load
rolls onto the ice.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.242
(truck creaks and moans)

27:58.244 --> 27:59.243
(rattling)

27:59.245 --> 28:03.947
- oh easy, easy, easy, easy,
easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

28:03.949 --> 28:05.582
(ice cracking)

28:06.786 --> 28:09.987
(ice cracking, water bubbling)

28:11.390 --> 28:12.856
(ice cracking and popping)

28:12.858 --> 28:16.493
mark: (over radio) look at the
size of this crack to the left.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.429
Holy crap!

28:18.798 --> 28:21.298
- Wow. Do you see that crack?

28:21.300 --> 28:25.302
Clear up the frickin' centre
of this whole entire thing!

28:26.005 --> 28:27.771
- Holy crack!

28:27.773 --> 28:30.774
- Wow! (bleep) gettin' ugly!

28:31.444 --> 28:34.244
(ice cracking and popping)

28:39.418 --> 28:40.718
- oh my god.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.120
- This ice is looking
pretty sketchy.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.489
(ice cracking and popping)

28:45.491 --> 28:47.825
(loud cracking)
- oh!

28:47.827 --> 28:50.627
The ice is cracking underneath.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.230
(ice snaps loudly)
- oh (bleep)!

28:57.670 --> 28:59.970
(ice cracking loudly)

29:00.806 --> 29:02.272
I'm making cracks!

29:02.274 --> 29:04.274
(ice cracking loudly)

29:04.343 --> 29:06.343
I just saw somethin'
I never saw before.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.847
(over radio) I saw a crack
appearing under my tire.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.449
It was in-credible.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.187
- Did you hear that?

29:17.990 --> 29:20.891
Mark: (over radio)
steph, do you copy?

29:20.893 --> 29:21.391
- Yeah, I do.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.628
(over radio)
oh my god I really want
to get off this ice.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.896
- Mark: (over radio)
proud of you, rookie,

29:25.898 --> 29:28.165
you're doin' a good job.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.834
- Why am I out here? Oh my god.

29:30.836 --> 29:35.506
- Everybody's just kinda
freakin' out a little bit.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.975
(loader rumbles loudly)

29:38.744 --> 29:40.511
(ice cracking)

29:40.513 --> 29:42.546
(ice cracking loudly)

29:42.548 --> 29:45.082
- oh, you hear that crackin'?

29:45.084 --> 29:46.283
(ice cracking)

29:46.285 --> 29:47.217
come on.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.520
Come on, just a little more.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.288
(ice cracking loudly)

29:51.290 --> 29:54.091
(engine rumbles onto land)

29:54.794 --> 29:56.160
I made it.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.395
Now I just need to make
sure everybody else

29:58.397 --> 30:00.597
makes it as well.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.834
(ice cracking and popping)

30:05.738 --> 30:06.937
- oh my gosh.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.239
(ice cracking loudly)

30:11.110 --> 30:12.609
woo!

30:13.412 --> 30:15.078
I made it to land.

30:15.681 --> 30:16.980
(horn honks)

30:16.982 --> 30:19.850
- coming to the end
of the crossing.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.286
(ice cracking loudly)

30:22.288 --> 30:24.021
major cracks.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.123
(ice cracking)

30:26.225 --> 30:29.893
(ice cracking loudly)
(engine rumbles onto land)

30:29.895 --> 30:33.363
and the rookie is off the ice,
boys. Woo!

30:33.365 --> 30:35.999
Narrator: Four drivers have
made it across.

30:36.001 --> 30:40.103
Todd: Holy (bleep)! I ain't
never seen cracks that wide.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.839
Narrator: Now after
nearly 80 tons

30:41.841 --> 30:45.342
have already damaged
the ice ahead of him...

30:45.344 --> 30:47.411
(ice snapping loudly)

30:47.413 --> 30:50.347
- and I've watchin' it move.
As the truck weight hits 'em

30:50.349 --> 30:53.183
the cracks are shiftin'
position.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.251
(ice cracking)

30:54.253 --> 30:57.721
narrator: The heaviest load
of the entire convoy's

30:57.723 --> 31:00.123
all on its own.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.794
- It's not good, I'm tellin ya.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.996
(ice cracking loudly)

31:05.998 --> 31:07.497
come on, come on.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.732
(ice snaps loudly)

31:08.734 --> 31:11.535
(ice cracking and popping)

31:12.838 --> 31:15.606
(engine rumbles onto land)

31:15.608 --> 31:17.674
- woo!
- Woo!

31:18.177 --> 31:19.309
Narrator: Despite ice so thin

31:19.311 --> 31:23.247
it would have scared away
most any other drivers...

31:23.249 --> 31:26.049
- That's spooky, flat spooky.

31:26.051 --> 31:29.586
Narrator: The convoy conquers
the crossing.

31:29.588 --> 31:30.721
- Everyone's here.

31:30.723 --> 31:36.093
Narrator: And head's out
for the final 80 miles.

31:36.095 --> 31:38.128
Mark: We were right
at its limits.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.329
Um, I gave everyone a choice.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.331
I wasn't gonna force anybody
to go across,

31:41.333 --> 31:45.602
but everybody decided on their
own will to make it.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.973
Narrator: While the convoy
presses into the night,

31:49.975 --> 31:53.010
150 miles to the southwest...

31:53.612 --> 31:55.913
(wind whistling)

31:59.618 --> 32:02.085
(engine rumbling)

32:03.088 --> 32:05.822
two grizzled vets are fightin'
their way back home

32:05.824 --> 32:10.193
over a melting trail
that's already totaled
one of their rigs.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.029
(loud rattling)

32:12.031 --> 32:15.265
alex: I got calluses
on my rear end.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.266
How far do we got left now?

32:16.268 --> 32:18.302
We must be getting pretty
darn close.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.371
We were talking 14 clicks
awhile ago.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.973
Narrator: Alex debogorski
and art burke

32:22.975 --> 32:25.709
are only 10 miles away
from the highway

32:25.711 --> 32:29.546
and off the road
out of sachigo lake.

32:29.915 --> 32:32.449
Art: Hopefully we'll (bleep)
make it.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.751
Now when we get onto the main
road for (bleep) sake

32:34.753 --> 32:37.287
don't go to sleep, man.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.058
- (laughing)

32:41.961 --> 32:43.360
(loud thuds)

32:44.330 --> 32:45.996
- oh!

32:45.998 --> 32:47.731
(rattling bangs)

32:47.733 --> 32:50.200
- we got a problem. What's that?

32:50.202 --> 32:51.368
(beeping)

32:51.370 --> 32:54.638
- what's wrong?
- What's that red light?

32:54.640 --> 32:55.539
(beeping)

32:55.541 --> 32:58.208
- right there.
- (bleep) I don't know.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.943
(beeping)

33:03.115 --> 33:04.548
(truck hisses and idles)

33:04.550 --> 33:05.949
(beeping)

33:12.558 --> 33:13.857
narrator: An air leak
in the brakes

33:13.859 --> 33:16.893
has caused them to seize up.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.628
(engine idles)

33:19.231 --> 33:21.398
- there's an air leak
somewhere.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.966
(hood clanks)

33:23.335 --> 33:27.871
narrator: And despite being
only steps away from the safety
of the highway

33:27.873 --> 33:32.542
art and alex are stuck
in the dead of night.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.312
Art: So alex is gonna crawl
underneath the truck there

33:35.314 --> 33:37.347
and see if there's any leaks.

33:41.453 --> 33:45.022
- Art!
Art: Yo? Comin' b'y, comin'.

33:50.829 --> 33:54.431
Art: Oh (bleep) I might have
a little bit to go in there.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.433
That there there, my friend,
that's the air tank.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.402
There's air tanks under there
and that one there

33:58.404 --> 34:02.539
tore off the bracket and its
hangin' underneath the truck.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.608
That's our problem.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.877
Narrator: Alex locates
the source of the leak,

34:06.879 --> 34:10.914
but fixing it on the side
of the road is another matter.

34:10.916 --> 34:14.117
- So we need to plug the air
tank and then chain it up.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.987
- Gonna be (bleep) tricky,
buddy.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.955
(air hisses loudly)

34:18.957 --> 34:20.524
it's round,
it's broke right off.

34:20.526 --> 34:23.794
You're into the tread part,
b'y.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.296
Alex: But that's where
our air is goin'.

34:26.298 --> 34:29.766
Art: I wonder how we could
plug that?

34:29.768 --> 34:31.802
- Well, get a piece of wood
I guess,

34:31.804 --> 34:34.171
that's the only thing
I can see.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.138
(air hissing)

34:35.140 --> 34:36.807
- I'll see what I can find,
buddy.

34:36.809 --> 34:41.011
Narrator: Despite not having
tools or a mechanic shop
nearby...

34:41.013 --> 34:43.747
- Gonna have to cut it off
and drive it in with a hammer.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.550
Narrator: The two old pros
will use a piece of wood

34:46.552 --> 34:49.152
to try and get the job done.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.754
(air hissing)

34:53.292 --> 34:54.825
(light tapping)

34:54.960 --> 34:56.960
(air stops hissing,
engine rumbles)

34:56.962 --> 34:58.995
art: Perfect, b'y.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.399
- Okay now we can
tighten it up.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.235
(light cranking sounds)

35:05.237 --> 35:07.737
- okay, try this again.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.540
Narrator: With the quick fix
in place...

35:10.542 --> 35:12.609
Art: Away we (bleep) go.

35:13.278 --> 35:13.810
(door shuts)

35:13.812 --> 35:19.683
narrator: It's time to see
if the wooden spare part
did the trick.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.184
(engine hums)

35:21.420 --> 35:24.354
alex: It's fixed.
Still have air.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.323
Art: Away we go again, b'y.

35:26.325 --> 35:29.292
- If I got 120 psi
that's all I need.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.628
Narrator: The brake's are back
in business.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.030
- Just keep 'er (bleep) going.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.966
- This is a wounded machine.
(laughing)

35:35.968 --> 35:39.569
after going on that road
this is a wounded machine.

35:40.105 --> 35:41.538
(truck rumbles)

35:41.540 --> 35:45.709
lordy, lordy, I think this
is the road.

35:45.711 --> 35:48.612
Narrator: And finally...

35:48.614 --> 35:49.813
Art: This is it.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.315
Around this turn this'll
be the end of her.

35:52.317 --> 35:56.686
Narrator: The winter road
is in the rear view mirror.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.254
(chains clanking)

35:57.256 --> 35:58.922
alex: Mission accomplished.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.657
Well, that's it for the season.

36:00.659 --> 36:05.629
I guess we're done for this
year, thank the lord.

36:06.098 --> 36:09.966
Thank you, lord.
Good job got us out here

36:10.235 --> 36:14.137
without us (clears throat)
meeting each other up.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.740
The truck's still running.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.709
- She's (bleep) over.

36:20.012 --> 36:23.280
As you would say
thank the lord.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.915
How's that?

36:26.185 --> 36:29.119
Alex: I'll have to talk to you
about your language, art.

36:29.121 --> 36:31.855
(laughing)

36:37.296 --> 36:43.600
: On the final 5 miles
on the road to north caribou...

36:44.203 --> 36:45.569
Darrell: We just gotta keep
pushing ahead

36:45.571 --> 36:47.637
and get this job done
and get out of here.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.339
- Well, we got to be
gettin close.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.875
Narrator: The unprecedented
two company convoy

36:51.877 --> 36:53.243
has pushed through the night

36:53.245 --> 36:56.813
and is on the verge
of making history.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.783
Since the epic journey began...

36:59.785 --> 37:00.684
(rapid beeping)

37:00.686 --> 37:02.118
darrell: What the (bleep)
is burnin', mark?

37:02.120 --> 37:05.889
Narrator: The rugged trail
has nearly stopped them...

37:05.891 --> 37:06.856
Mark: (coughing violently)

37:06.858 --> 37:09.593
all right, lisa,
let's give her!

37:09.595 --> 37:10.594
- Don't let me sink.

37:10.596 --> 37:13.196
Narrator: Every step
of the way.

37:13.198 --> 37:15.432
- (over radio) holy crap!

37:15.434 --> 37:16.700
(ice cracking and popping)

37:16.702 --> 37:19.603
todd: I ain't never seen
cracks that wide.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.405
(ice cracking and popping)

37:23.108 --> 37:23.907
narrator: Now...

37:23.909 --> 37:26.476
- My hat's off to each
and every one of you.

37:26.478 --> 37:30.747
Narrator: After two days
and 400 taxing miles...

37:30.749 --> 37:33.483
- I was wonderin' if we were
every going to get here.

37:33.485 --> 37:37.420
Narrator: The convoy makes
it to the remote village.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.322
- Yee-haw! Bam!

37:40.158 --> 37:41.825
(engine hisses)

37:41.827 --> 37:43.860
(metallic clanking)

37:44.229 --> 37:46.997
- that was one hell of a trip.

37:47.199 --> 37:50.166
- Yeah, pull up on that side
of him.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.135
Steph: Everyone's coming
together really nice

37:52.137 --> 37:53.703
and it's good to see two
companies work together

37:53.705 --> 37:57.140
like that so that these people
can get what they need.

37:57.142 --> 37:59.843
Lisa: We all stuck together
and we all helped each other.

37:59.845 --> 38:02.245
That's something to celebrate
right there.

38:02.247 --> 38:05.048
Narrator: As the final supplies
are off loaded...

38:05.050 --> 38:07.117
(beeping)
(truck horn honks)

38:07.119 --> 38:08.418
lisa: Woo hoo!

38:08.420 --> 38:10.020
Mark: We got her!

38:10.022 --> 38:11.988
Narrators: The drivers
celebrate completing

38:11.990 --> 38:15.158
the toughest mission
of their careers.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.893
- Last load delivered, buddy!

38:16.895 --> 38:19.796
- We did good.
- (bleep) great.
- We did good.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.399
Mark: You know I'm really proud
of what we were able to do
on this run:

38:22.401 --> 38:25.135
Work together, team work
for the communities.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.002
That's what counts.

38:26.004 --> 38:29.472
Todd: Good job, mark.
Good job, buddy.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.741
Mark: You know what?
We make a really good team.

38:31.743 --> 38:32.575
We pulled this off.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.610
You guys were awesome out here.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.912
I got a new found respect
for what you guys do out here.

38:35.914 --> 38:39.082
Everybody in the trucks,
let's bust out guys, let's go!

38:39.084 --> 38:42.952
All: Yeah! Woo!

38:43.789 --> 38:45.221
(door shuts)

38:46.458 --> 38:47.957
(door shuts)

38:48.527 --> 38:51.895
all right, guys,
onur way home.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.230
Mission accomplished.

38:54.399 --> 38:56.199
Narrator: The last loads
are in the books

38:56.201 --> 38:58.835
and the final hauls
are delivered

38:58.837 --> 39:01.171
and as the drivers head back

39:01.173 --> 39:03.306
they'll take with them memories

39:03.308 --> 39:06.109
of the season that
almost beat 'em.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.211
Steph: It's weird you'd think...

39:08.213 --> 39:09.412
You're just going out there
to truck

39:09.414 --> 39:11.081
and holy (bleep) was I wrong,

39:11.083 --> 39:14.617
the amount of things
that you run into.

39:14.619 --> 39:17.253
I just made it to land I think.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.255
Todd, I made it.
(excited gasp)

39:19.257 --> 39:21.791
todd: (over radio) your first
real big ice crossing.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.526
I'm proud of ya!
- (emotional gasp)

39:23.528 --> 39:26.996
- we like adventure,
we like the adrenaline rush.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.932
(loud bang)
- ah!

39:29.501 --> 39:31.501
(loud bang)
ah!

39:31.503 --> 39:33.370
(engine rumbles)

39:33.372 --> 39:35.472
- every load's a contest.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.140
(booming thud) whoa!

39:37.142 --> 39:40.510
You know, man and a machine
against the element.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.245
(chains rattling)

39:42.247 --> 39:46.216
- holes and mud,
the road was just the (bleep).

39:46.218 --> 39:48.184
(rattling thuds)

39:48.186 --> 39:50.687
(huge thudding bang)
whoa!

39:51.223 --> 39:52.989
(booming crash)

39:53.392 --> 39:56.059
but we got 'er done, b'y.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.927
(chains rattling)

39:59.131 --> 40:03.099
and we did it as a team,
all of us together.

40:03.101 --> 40:03.800
Todd: And you know what?

40:03.802 --> 40:05.769
No matter how many tears
gotta be shed,

40:05.771 --> 40:09.105
no matter how many truck parts
get broken,

40:09.107 --> 40:10.540
we get the loads
to the community

40:10.542 --> 40:11.241
and we get the job done

40:11.243 --> 40:14.210
and we go home with a smile
on our face.

40:14.212 --> 40:17.814
Darrell: What it means
to be a trucker?

40:17.816 --> 40:18.548
Freedom.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.784
I can say it in one word.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.019
Not everybody gets to do
what I get to do.

40:23.021 --> 40:27.590
I feel very fortunate
to be an ice road trucker.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.628
(truck rumbles)
