00:07.460 --> 00:10.460
'Portland Tower's
been declared a critical incident.

00:10.460 --> 00:11.660
'Two confirmed fatalities.

00:11.660 --> 00:14.460
'One teenage girl,
one police officer.'

00:14.460 --> 00:15.460
I'm Sarah Collins,

00:15.460 --> 00:18.300
from the Directorate
of Special Investigations.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.820
Your daughter Farah...

00:21.820 --> 00:25.460
I'm afraid she died. It's a death
in contact with police, Lizzie.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.820
The girl's dead. Hadley's dead.

00:26.820 --> 00:29.460
DSI run the investigation,
no choice.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.500
We need statements,
especially that female PC.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.460
She was up there. She saw.

00:34.820 --> 00:37.460
What were you thinking?!
Please don't hurt my dad.

00:37.460 --> 00:38.980
She's gone.

00:38.980 --> 00:41.460
Do you know why she's ran
or where she might've gone?

00:41.460 --> 00:44.140
She's a significant witness
in a sex trafficking case.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.460
Who's the suspect?
Laszlo Kovacs.

00:46.460 --> 00:49.460
Phone number in the girl's pocket.
It was Lizzie Adama's mobile.

00:49.460 --> 00:53.300
You wanna put Detective Inspector
Shaw under directed surveillance?

00:53.300 --> 00:56.460
We have evidence he's interfering
in our investigation.

00:56.460 --> 00:58.980
I've got a lot of confidence in you,
Lizzie, you know that?

01:01.460 --> 01:04.460
I think we're done protecting
Lizzie Adama, don't you?

01:15.460 --> 01:17.460
'We've had this discussion, Sarah.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.460
'I don't wanna put PC Adama at risk
by putting her all over the news.'

01:20.460 --> 01:22.460
I gave her a chance to come in, Sir,
and she refused.

01:22.460 --> 01:24.460
She's a police officer,
she's absent without leave.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.660
I was face-to-face with her.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.460
I don't think she ran off
because of Laszlo Kovacs.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.460
I think she's hiding something.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.460
Is Steve with you?
Does he have a view?

01:35.460 --> 01:38.460
I agree with Sarah, Sir.
The sooner we find her, the better.

01:38.460 --> 01:41.460
What if you went on TV
and appealed to her personally?

01:41.460 --> 01:44.460
'The sight of a senior officer,
in uniform, reassuring her...'

01:44.460 --> 01:46.460
You think the uniform's important?

01:46.460 --> 01:49.460
'To Lizzie, just six months in,
I'd say it means a lot.'

01:49.460 --> 01:52.460
Yeah, good idea, Steve.
I'll run it upstairs.

01:52.460 --> 01:56.460
Talk to the press office.
In the meantime, wrap this up, yeah?

01:56.460 --> 01:57.460
'You're close aren't you?'

01:57.460 --> 01:59.460
Mehenni's still refusing to talk
to us.

01:59.460 --> 02:02.460
Carrie Stoddard's the same, so...
'There are no new facts.

02:02.460 --> 02:04.460
'A crazy girl got herself
and an officer killed

02:04.460 --> 02:05.460
'and could've done a lot worse.'

02:05.460 --> 02:07.460
I know
Farah's a convenient scapegoat.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.460
'I didn't say scapegoat.'

02:08.460 --> 02:10.460
But we still don't know
why Farah did it,

02:10.460 --> 02:13.460
and I believe that
PC Adama and DI Shaw do know.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.460
You leave Shaw alone, Sarah...

02:18.460 --> 02:21.460
and I'll help you bring PC Adama in.

02:21.460 --> 02:22.460
Got it?

02:47.460 --> 02:49.820
Can we just get over
to the other side of the pavement?

02:51.820 --> 02:54.500
'As the Portland Tower
investigation continues,

02:54.500 --> 02:58.460
'disturbing CCTV images
have come to light

02:58.460 --> 03:02.460
'showing schoolgirl Farah Mehenni
and the unnamed five-year-old boy

03:02.460 --> 03:04.460
'walking towards the Tower

03:04.460 --> 03:07.460
'on the afternoon of
her and PC Matthews' deaths.

03:07.460 --> 03:11.460
'Though the reason why Farah
took the boy remains unknown.'

03:16.460 --> 03:18.460
Kieran?
Sir.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.460
DSI caught up with
Lizzie Adama last night.

03:20.460 --> 03:23.460
She refused to come in, she ran.

03:24.460 --> 03:26.460
I'm doing a press conference
in a few minutes.

03:26.460 --> 03:29.460
I'll be releasing her photo,
asking the public for information.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.460
Sir, I told you,
you identify Lizzie,

03:31.460 --> 03:32.460
you put her in serious danger.

03:32.460 --> 03:35.460
She had a chance to hand herself in,
she didn't take it. She's scared!

03:35.460 --> 03:36.460
Then she should come in.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.460
Or is there something else going on?

03:40.460 --> 03:42.460
No, Sir.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.460
There's nothing else going on.

03:44.460 --> 03:46.460
Except that
I've already lost one good officer

03:46.460 --> 03:48.660
and I don't wanna lose another.
That's it.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.460
Then let's hope she comes in.
Sir.

04:22.140 --> 04:24.140
Sergeant Collins?

04:24.140 --> 04:25.460
Julie Woodson.

04:29.820 --> 04:33.460
Your officers turned this place
upside down, wouldn't even say why.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.460
Farah's phone is missing.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.460
When you called, you said
you wanted to talk about Farah.

04:41.460 --> 04:43.460
Have you even bothered to speak
to her father?

04:43.460 --> 04:46.460
He refuses to speak to the police.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.460
I don't know if you're responsible,

04:47.460 --> 04:49.500
but the way
the media is talking about Farah,

04:49.500 --> 04:51.980
disturbed teen, etcetera...

04:51.980 --> 04:53.460
well, it's just wrong.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.460
She kidnapped a five-year old,
we're lucky she didn't kill him.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.460
So what can you tell me
about Farah?

05:04.460 --> 05:08.460
She was bright... hardworking.

05:09.460 --> 05:11.460
She was kind.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.460
She looked out for the weaker kids.
Hated bullying.

05:14.460 --> 05:17.820
That she's dead after everything
that she'd been through...

05:19.460 --> 05:20.460
It's so unfair.

05:20.460 --> 05:21.980
Everything she'd been through?

05:21.980 --> 05:24.460
Well, the little I know.

05:24.460 --> 05:28.460
Her dad was a driver
for a British NGO in Libya.

05:28.460 --> 05:31.140
They supported
his asylum application,

05:31.140 --> 05:33.460
but Farah had to wait
two years in a refugee camp.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.660
That's when her mum died.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.460
That's why she worked so hard.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.820
She knew what it cost
just to get here.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.460
Why do you think she took the boy?

05:45.460 --> 05:46.500
For Farah to do that,

05:46.500 --> 05:49.460
someone must have done something
really bad to her.

05:49.460 --> 05:51.460
Why do you say that?

05:51.460 --> 05:54.140
Well, she had this...

05:54.140 --> 05:57.460
I don't know,
this... sense of what was right.

05:57.460 --> 06:00.460
Keep your side of the bargain
and everyone else will too.

06:00.460 --> 06:04.660
So, if you wanna know why
she took the boy...

06:04.660 --> 06:06.460
find out who hurt her.

06:11.460 --> 06:13.460
'Hey.'
Steve.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.460
Dig out the police interview
with Mehenni.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.820
Something set Farah off,
see if you can find what it was.

06:18.820 --> 06:20.140
'Got it.'

06:22.140 --> 06:24.460
'Present are
Police Constable Lizzie Adama.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.460
'Marcus Hicks,
representing Mr Mehenni.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.460
'Younes Ibrahim Mehenni.

06:28.460 --> 06:32.460
'Mr Mehenni, a complaint of criminal
damage has been made against you.'

06:32.460 --> 06:34.460
'By my neighbour, Carrie Stoddard.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.460
'She wants to get us
thrown out of our house.'

06:37.460 --> 06:40.460
A whole heap of that,
"evil Carrie Stoddard".

06:40.460 --> 06:41.660
This is where it gets tasty.

06:41.660 --> 06:45.460
'And then, you police,
you force your way into my house.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.460
'Even though you have no warrant.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.820
'And when
my daughter comes home from school,'

06:49.820 --> 06:52.460
the big policeman says racist things
to my daughter.

06:54.140 --> 06:56.460
"All right, Little Miss Jihadi?"

06:56.460 --> 06:59.460
'Mr Mehenni, I ask the questions...

06:59.460 --> 07:01.460
'And then he says to her,

07:01.460 --> 07:04.460
' "Tell your father.
What's his name, Mohammed, is it?'

07:04.460 --> 07:08.460
"Mohammed Bin Laden?
Tell him we want to talk to him."

07:10.460 --> 07:14.460
Well, my name is not Mohammed.
It is not Bin Laden...

07:14.460 --> 07:17.460
and what he said to my daughter...
Mr Mehenni!

07:17.460 --> 07:20.140
I'm interviewing you.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.460
You've made a complaint,
you have your solicitor here,

07:22.460 --> 07:26.460
your complaint will be dealt with,
but not now, not by me.

07:30.460 --> 07:31.460
Is this it?

07:31.460 --> 07:34.460
Bin Laden?

07:34.460 --> 07:36.460
Little Miss Jihadi?

07:36.460 --> 07:37.460
I read
Hadley and Lizzie's statements.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.460
They both deny
he said anything racist.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.140
Well, they would, wouldn't they?
Do the body cams show anything?

07:42.140 --> 07:45.460
Only Lizzie's was recording.
Didn't pick up any racist language,

07:45.460 --> 07:47.460
just her and Hadley
chasing after Mehenni.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.460
OK. We're done here.

07:51.460 --> 07:54.460
Let's pack up, get all the evidence
back to Victoria House.

'Don't Start Now'
by Dua Lipa

08:04.460 --> 08:06.460
Hey, you all right?
Hey.

08:11.460 --> 08:14.300
Hiya. Hey.
Usual? Yeah.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.460
A gin and tonic, please.

08:16.460 --> 08:19.460
Er, so, I interviewed Mehenni.

08:19.460 --> 08:22.140
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Yeah, he denies everything.

08:22.140 --> 08:24.460
I bailed him, pending CPS.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.460
He made a complaint.

08:28.460 --> 08:32.660
His... daughter says you used
racist language towards her.

08:32.660 --> 08:34.460
Yeah, heard that too.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.140
Well, what the fuck, Hadley,
a teenage girl? Did you?

08:37.140 --> 08:41.460
No. It's a load of rubbish.
You were with me, you know I didn't.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.460
I wasn't with you.
I was in the garden.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.460
You were close enough,
you'd have heard.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.460
Lizzie.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.460
I didn't do this.

08:51.460 --> 08:52.460
Scout's honour.

08:52.460 --> 08:55.460
Look, I've got this board coming up
for the training school.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.460
You're gonna be a shiny-arse?

08:58.460 --> 09:01.140
Yeah, I am.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.820
I've had 27 years of freezing nights
and shitty crime scenes.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.460
I'm just too old and too fat.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.460
This complaint means
I'll miss the board.

09:12.460 --> 09:15.460
I'm sorry.
I've written the statement.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.460
I can't go back and change it.

09:17.460 --> 09:19.460
I'm not asking you to change it,
I'm asking you to add to it,

09:19.460 --> 09:21.460
which is completely kosher,
by the way.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.460
Hadders? Where's me bloody drink?

09:23.460 --> 09:24.460
Yeah, all right.

09:24.460 --> 09:27.460
Just say you were with me,
cos you were.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.980
You didn't hear me say anything,
cos I didn't.

09:33.460 --> 09:36.460
Finally! Thank you very much.

09:36.460 --> 09:40.460
There we go.
Ask and you shall receive...

09:41.460 --> 09:42.460
I was just saying, Lizzie,

09:42.460 --> 09:44.460
that soon,
I'm gonna be off to pastures new,

09:44.460 --> 09:46.460
where the women are better-looking

09:46.460 --> 09:48.500
and, more importantly,
they don't know me.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.460
Follow my lead.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.980
Oh!

10:07.980 --> 10:09.460
Sod it.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.980
You go, Steve,
I'll see you back at base.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.460
Thanks. It's Arif, isn't it?

10:15.460 --> 10:18.460
Yeah. You guys finished here, then?

10:18.460 --> 10:21.460
Here, yes. The inquiry, no.

10:21.460 --> 10:24.660
Not with Lizzie Adama still missing.
I'm worried about her.

10:24.660 --> 10:28.460
Well, maybe she just wants to be
alone for a bit.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.660
Her and Hadley were real close.

10:32.460 --> 10:35.460
You know, some stories have come out
about Hadley. Allegations.

10:35.460 --> 10:39.460
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
He was outrageous.

10:39.460 --> 10:42.980
My very first day, he said to me,
"Sonny, you're in the wrong job.

10:42.980 --> 10:45.460
"You're a copper, so
half the punters are gonna hate you,

10:45.460 --> 10:47.460
"and you're Asian, so the other half
are gonna hate you too."

10:47.460 --> 10:50.460
He actually said that to you?
Yeah. And then he said,

10:50.460 --> 10:52.460
"All credit to you for trying,
though,

10:52.460 --> 10:56.140
"and if anyone in this nick
gives you shit, you let me know."

10:56.140 --> 10:59.460
He looked out for me,
like he did for Lizzie.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.460
He made a point of it.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.460
I know it sounds corny,
but I really loved them.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.460
All three of them.

'Seventeen Going Under'
by Sam Fender

11:18.460 --> 11:19.460
Gin and tonic?

11:19.460 --> 11:21.500
Yeah. Thanks.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.660
So, you get your bad guy?

11:26.660 --> 11:28.460
No. Missed him again.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.460
You must've thought
I was a right idiot,

11:32.460 --> 11:35.460
running off excited,
guns and fast cars.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.820
Nah.
No?

11:36.820 --> 11:38.460
I would've been excited too.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.460
Yeah?
Yeah.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.460
Yeah, I think you would.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.460
I think you could handle it.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.460
Yeah?
Yeah.

11:56.460 --> 11:59.460
Ah, I've got an early start
tomorrow,

11:59.460 --> 12:00.460
so...

12:01.460 --> 12:05.300
I'm actually gonna have to head off
soon.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.460
If you must, let me drive you.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.460
I'm staying
at our London flat tonight.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.460
You're not that far from me,
are you?

12:12.460 --> 12:13.460
No.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.460
Let me drive you.

12:22.460 --> 12:24.980
I heard about the Mehenni complaint,
by the way.

12:24.980 --> 12:27.460
Unauthorised entry, racist language.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.460
Hadley said it was bollocks.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.460
He said
you were with him all the time.

12:34.460 --> 12:35.460
I wasn't.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.820
I wasn't.
He shouldn't have said that. OK.

12:42.460 --> 12:46.460
Hadley will have to handle it.
It's no big deal. I promise.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.820
Erm, I can get out here.

12:53.820 --> 12:56.460
I'm just three streets over.
No, I'll drop you.

12:59.460 --> 13:01.460
Unless you want a drink first.

13:04.460 --> 13:08.300
I'm, er... one street that way.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.460
Thanks for your help, Arif.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.460
Just one thing.

13:23.460 --> 13:26.460
What did you mean,
"all three of them"?

13:26.460 --> 13:27.500
Hadley, Lizzie, and the guv'nor.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.140
I don't want her or the guv
to get in trouble.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.460
Well, why would they...
get in trouble?

14:04.460 --> 14:06.460
Lizzie's sleeping with
her married boss.

14:06.460 --> 14:08.140
That's not an issue for you?

14:08.140 --> 14:11.300
It's not a crime.
It's not even against regulations.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.300
Well, then why didn't he mention it
in his post-incident interview?

14:14.300 --> 14:15.460
But what's the affair got to do with

14:15.460 --> 14:17.460
two people falling off
a tower block?

14:17.460 --> 14:20.460
Well, for a start,
if PC Matthews' racist language

14:20.460 --> 14:22.460
is the instigating incident...

14:22.460 --> 14:24.820
PC Adama said she didn't hear him
use racist language

14:24.820 --> 14:27.460
and the Asian PC who worked with him
says he's not racist.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.660
Farah's dad is charged
with criminal damage

14:29.660 --> 14:32.460
and Farah stepped
in front of a speeding police car.

14:32.460 --> 14:34.460
You know,
this is not a happy family.

14:34.460 --> 14:36.460
We all feel really badly
for the girl,

14:36.460 --> 14:38.460
but she's the one
who took a five-year-old

14:38.460 --> 14:39.460
to the top of the tower block.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.460
Did you actually read
Lizzie's statement, Alice?

14:51.460 --> 14:52.980
Yeah, why?

14:52.980 --> 14:55.460
You didn't read it very carefully.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.460
She wrote two statements
about the visit to Mehenni's house.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.460
The first doesn't even mention
racist language.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.460
Six days later,
she writes a second statement.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.460
"I have been requested
by my inspector

15:06.460 --> 15:08.140
"to submit a further statement

15:08.140 --> 15:11.460
"to clarify
one aspect of these inquiries."

15:11.460 --> 15:13.140
Guess which aspect.

15:13.140 --> 15:15.460
She was with PC Matthews
the whole visit.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.460
He didn't say anything racist.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.460
"As requested by my guv'nor,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.460
"with whom I happen to be
having an affair."

15:21.460 --> 15:23.460
And look at what happens next.

15:23.460 --> 15:26.300
19th of April,
Lizzie's second statement.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.460
21st of April, Mehenni's complaint
against the police is dismissed,

15:29.460 --> 15:32.460
Mehenni's remanded in custody,
Farah kidnaps the boy.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.500
Talk about cause and effect.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.460
OK.

15:37.460 --> 15:41.460
We've been at it almost 48 hours.
We're tired, mistakes happen.

15:41.460 --> 15:45.300
Go home and get some kip.
Back here in six.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.500
Meanwhile,
I will make a formal request

15:46.500 --> 15:48.980
for directed surveillance
on DI Shaw.

15:48.980 --> 15:51.460
You going back to Bailie?
No, I'm going round him.

15:53.460 --> 15:54.500
OK, everyone.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.140
Home.

16:10.460 --> 16:14.460
'And then the big policeman
says racist things to my daughter.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.460
'But my name is not Mohammed.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.140
'It isn't Bin Laden.'

16:36.460 --> 16:38.460
There you go.

16:38.460 --> 16:39.660
Thanks.

16:53.460 --> 16:57.460
'..which led to the deaths of
a teenage girl and a police officer.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.460
'With us is
Chief Inspector Tim Bailie

16:59.460 --> 17:01.460
'to talk about the incident.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.460
'Tragedy is the right word.

17:03.460 --> 17:08.460
'But for the heroic intervention
of Police Constable Hadley Matthews,

17:08.460 --> 17:11.460
'I fear we may be discussing
an even more terrible outcome.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.460
'And I'd like to use the opportunity

17:13.460 --> 17:16.460
'to appeal someone who witnessed
the events at the tower

17:16.460 --> 17:20.140
'and was no doubt traumatised
by them.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.460
'Lizzie Adama.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.460
'And I wanna stress that
Lizzie is in no way a suspect,

17:23.460 --> 17:27.460
'far from it, but we just have
concerns for her safety.

17:27.460 --> 17:31.460
'So Lizzie, if you see this,
then please call your family,

17:31.460 --> 17:33.460
'or come into any police station.'

17:35.300 --> 17:36.460
Where the hell are you, Sarah?

17:36.460 --> 17:38.460
I'm at home,
getting a change of clothes.

17:38.460 --> 17:39.460
'A change of clothes?'

17:39.460 --> 17:41.460
What?

17:41.460 --> 17:44.460
How can I help you, Sir?
'You went behind my back.'

17:44.460 --> 17:46.460
You asked DCS Russell
for surveillance on Shaw

17:46.460 --> 17:48.460
after I'd already refused
that surveillance.

17:48.460 --> 17:51.460
Sir,
I have evidence that DI Shaw is...

17:51.460 --> 17:53.460
Told me your evidence,
it wasn't strong enough.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.460
Did I tell you
he was fucking PC Adama?

17:55.460 --> 17:59.460
'Look... she's still AWOL.'

17:59.460 --> 18:01.460
Younes Mehenni won't talk to me.

18:01.460 --> 18:04.460
Carrie Stoddard won't talk to me.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.460
All I have is DI Shaw,
who is up to his bloody neck in it.

18:07.460 --> 18:10.460
'An affair's not a crime.'
Yeah.

18:10.460 --> 18:12.460
So everyone keeps telling me.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.460
It still stinks.

18:15.460 --> 18:18.460
'It's not enough.
DCS Russell agrees with me.'

18:18.460 --> 18:20.820
Your request for surveillance
on DI Shaw is denied.

18:20.820 --> 18:22.980
'Are we clear?'

18:22.980 --> 18:24.460
Sarah, are we clear?

18:25.460 --> 18:27.460
Yes, Sir.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.300
Nice shirt.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.140
Blouse.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.660
Suits you.
Doubt it.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.460
It was Angie's.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.460
The woman has gone,
the clothes remain.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.460
Bailie call you?
Did he ever.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.460
No surveillance on Shaw.

18:56.460 --> 19:00.500
New angle.
Lizzie Adama's second statement.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.460
What made her write it?

19:02.460 --> 19:05.460
Well, there's always pressure
to back your partner.

19:05.460 --> 19:08.500
Would've been even harder on her,
young Black officer,

19:08.500 --> 19:10.460
her partner accused of racism.

19:10.460 --> 19:11.980
But she held out for six days,

19:11.980 --> 19:14.460
then she wrote her statement
at 5:30 in the morning.

19:14.460 --> 19:16.460
So, what made her crack?

19:17.980 --> 19:19.820
What happened that night?

19:20.980 --> 19:22.460
OK.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.460
Stay back, Joe.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.460
Cosmina? We're police.

19:31.460 --> 19:32.660
Where are you?

19:37.460 --> 19:38.460
Found her!

19:38.460 --> 19:40.460
I'll check the back.
OK.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.140
Oh, my God...

19:46.140 --> 19:47.980
Control receiving 1835,

19:47.980 --> 19:51.500
request LAS for adult woman
at 14 Chandler, SE12.

19:51.500 --> 19:56.460
Woman is severely beaten,
unconscious...

19:56.460 --> 19:57.460
'Roger that...'

19:57.460 --> 19:58.980
Scrub that, Control,
woman is conscious,

19:58.980 --> 20:00.460
but with serious head injuries.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.460
'Copy that, 1835...'

20:01.460 --> 20:03.460
You all right, love?
Can you hear us?

20:03.460 --> 20:04.460
Has he gone?

20:04.460 --> 20:06.460
Yeah, he's gone. We're the police.

20:06.460 --> 20:09.460
Police... Shit.

20:09.460 --> 20:12.460
We've called an ambulance.
We're gonna get you to hospital.

20:12.460 --> 20:15.460
No hospital. I gotta call Laszlo.

20:15.460 --> 20:18.460
Did, erm...
Did Laszlo do this to you?

20:19.460 --> 20:22.460
Cosmina... did he do this?

20:22.460 --> 20:27.140
It was a fight.
But I'm OK. No hospital.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.460
Give me your hand.

20:34.460 --> 20:38.660
If it was me sitting where you are,
what would you tell me to do?

20:40.460 --> 20:42.460
I would say, "Go to hospital."

20:54.460 --> 20:59.460
You door-stepping me? I thought
you people were done here.

20:59.460 --> 21:03.140
Not quite. I'd like to know
what case PC Adama was working

21:03.140 --> 21:04.460
the night of 18th of April.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.460
What the hell's that gotta do
with Portland Tower?

21:08.460 --> 21:10.460
We'd just like to know, Sir.

21:10.460 --> 21:15.980
Hmm. 18th of April was the day
that Lizzie ran into Laszlo Kovacs.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.460
The case I told you about.

21:19.460 --> 21:20.460
The case
you don't give a damn about,

21:20.460 --> 21:23.460
which is why Lizzie Adama's face
is all over the news.

21:23.460 --> 21:24.820
What happened?

21:24.820 --> 21:27.460
Lizzie and Hadley responded
to a 999 call.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.460
One of Kovacs' girls,
Cosmina Baicu.

21:30.460 --> 21:33.460
They came to the aid
of a brutally beaten young woman.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.460
They showed
what good cops they were.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.460
That's what happened.

21:39.460 --> 21:42.460
What was the fight about?
Money. Money?

21:43.980 --> 21:46.460
Laszlo's your pimp?

21:46.460 --> 21:47.460
Manager.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.460
Who am I fucking kidding?

21:52.500 --> 21:55.820
He takes... more than his share.

21:55.820 --> 21:58.300
I complain, he beats me.

21:58.300 --> 22:00.460
I try to leave, he beats me.

22:00.460 --> 22:03.460
I'll never get
out of this shithole.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.980
Yes, you will.
We're gonna help you.

22:09.460 --> 22:10.460
You call the police?

22:12.140 --> 22:13.460
Are you Laszlo?

22:15.460 --> 22:16.460
Stay away from her.

22:30.460 --> 22:32.660
Put the gun down.
You're under arrest.

22:37.980 --> 22:39.460
You're filming me.

22:52.660 --> 22:54.500
Ambulance is here.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.460
What's going on? You OK?

22:56.460 --> 23:00.460
Laszlo. Went out back.
He had a firearm. He took my camera.

23:01.460 --> 23:04.460
1272 to Control.
'Control receiving.'

23:04.460 --> 23:08.460
Urgent Trojan request. Armed suspect
leaving scene on foot. Suspect is...

23:08.460 --> 23:10.300
IC1 male.
IC1 male.

23:10.300 --> 23:11.460
6ft.
6ft.

23:11.460 --> 23:14.820
30s, black leather jacket, beard.
30s, black leather jacket, beard.

23:14.820 --> 23:17.460
In you go, guys.
Thank you.

23:18.820 --> 23:20.980
We're just here
to have a quick look at you.

23:20.980 --> 23:22.820
I'm OK, thank you very much.

23:22.820 --> 23:25.460
You have a serious head injury,
you have to go to hospital.

23:25.460 --> 23:26.460
No, I refuse.

23:26.460 --> 23:29.820
You can go, please. No hospital.

23:29.820 --> 23:34.660
Stopping body-worn video at 4:46pm.

23:35.980 --> 23:38.300
Sorry, love.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.500
No offence, but, er...

23:40.500 --> 23:42.460
I don't like it here very much.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.460
Your boyfriend's running round
with a gun,

23:44.460 --> 23:46.460
and I'm due a cup of tea...

23:47.460 --> 23:48.460
Now, I can't arrest you,

23:48.460 --> 23:51.460
but I have other powers
under the Mental Health Act.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.460
So I'm gonna section you

23:53.460 --> 23:56.460
cos I believe you're a danger
to yourself, and to me.

23:56.460 --> 23:59.460
And if you don't go to hospital
voluntarily,

23:59.460 --> 24:00.460
I'm gonna force you to go.

24:01.460 --> 24:03.460
Can he do that?

24:06.460 --> 24:09.460
Here come the cavalry.

24:11.460 --> 24:13.460
You go with Cosmina to the hospital.

24:13.460 --> 24:15.460
See if you can get her account
of what happened.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.500
I'll join you there.

24:19.460 --> 24:21.460
You all right, kiddo?

24:26.460 --> 24:28.460
Guv said you wanted to talk to me

24:28.460 --> 24:30.140
about what happened
at the Mehennis'.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.300
Not scared about getting in trouble,
are you?

24:33.300 --> 24:36.500
I've told you...
I've written my statement.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.820
I don't know what I can do.
I told you, you can add to it.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.460
Just say you didn't hear me
say anything.

24:42.460 --> 24:44.140
"Little Miss Jihadi."

24:44.140 --> 24:47.460
That sounds like you, Hadley,
the sort of thing you think's funny,

24:47.460 --> 24:50.460
and it isn't, especially not
to a 15-year-old Muslim kid.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.300
Which is why I didn't say it.

24:53.460 --> 24:57.460
Do you know how often Arab kids,
Black kids, get that type of shit,

24:57.460 --> 24:59.820
and then to hear it
from a policeman?

24:59.820 --> 25:02.140
Lizzie, I didn't say it,
for God's sake.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.460
Do you think I'm a racist?

25:06.660 --> 25:08.460
No.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.460
I fucking despise racists.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.460
The young girl's just protecting
her father,

25:13.460 --> 25:15.140
she makes up a load of stuff.

25:15.140 --> 25:18.460
I can understand why she did it, but
she could ruin the rest of my life.

25:18.460 --> 25:19.980
I'm sorry.

25:19.980 --> 25:22.460
I've written the statement.

25:22.460 --> 25:24.460
I wasn't with you the whole time.

25:26.460 --> 25:28.460
OK.

25:30.460 --> 25:33.460
Four weeks ago...
when you caught that shoplifter,

25:33.460 --> 25:35.460
you searched her
before I got to you.

25:36.460 --> 25:40.460
Well, yeah,
you move like an aircraft carrier.

25:40.460 --> 25:43.460
Well, that's a fattist comment,
but I'll let it go.

25:43.460 --> 25:46.460
You searched her,
but you forgot to turn on your BWV.

25:48.460 --> 25:49.460
Yeah, OK, that...
that isn't the same...

25:49.460 --> 25:51.460
And I told you turn it on
and do the search again,

25:51.460 --> 25:53.460
as per the regulations.
Hadley, it's not...

25:53.460 --> 25:56.140
And that's exactly what I said
happened in my statement.

25:56.140 --> 25:57.460
"It was a lawful search."
Hadley...

25:57.460 --> 26:00.460
I backed you because you're
my partner and because I trust you,

26:00.460 --> 26:02.300
and because
that's what you bloody do.

26:02.300 --> 26:05.460
Hadley, I will not fucking lie
for you!

26:11.460 --> 26:13.460
This is why I wanna know
about the 18th of April.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.460
That was the night that
PC Adama wrote her second statement

26:15.460 --> 26:17.460
about PC Matthews.
You can't just barge in here...

26:17.460 --> 26:20.460
Because of that statement, Younes
Mehenni was remanded in custody,

26:20.460 --> 26:22.460
Farah Mehenni took the boy
to Portland Tower,

26:22.460 --> 26:24.460
where she and PC Matthews died.

26:24.460 --> 26:26.660
What happened that night
that made PC Adama change her mind?

26:26.660 --> 26:29.140
How do I know what's in her mind?

26:29.140 --> 26:32.460
Really? Aren't you in a relationship
with her?

26:33.460 --> 26:35.460
Did you pressure her?

26:35.460 --> 26:36.500
If you're questioning my integrity,

26:36.500 --> 26:39.460
I'll see you in an interview room
with a lawyer and a Fed rep.

26:39.460 --> 26:40.980
In the meantime, get out.

26:40.980 --> 26:42.460
We're leaving, Sir.

26:42.460 --> 26:45.140
But you know we're gonna have
to speak to someone about Kovacs,

26:45.140 --> 26:46.460
just to complete our report.

26:46.460 --> 26:47.460
Case is with the murder squad,

26:47.460 --> 26:49.460
but I doubt they'll give you
the time of day.

26:50.460 --> 26:53.460
Who's the case officer?
DS O'Neil.

26:53.460 --> 26:55.460
Jack O'Neil?

26:56.460 --> 26:57.460
Mm-hm.

26:58.460 --> 26:59.980
Oh, that's nice.

26:59.980 --> 27:03.820
Cos Jack and I go way back way back,
so I'm sure I can get him to talk.

27:03.820 --> 27:05.460
You know how that works.

27:08.300 --> 27:09.460
Sarah, shall we, erm...?

27:25.460 --> 27:28.460
You and Hadley did well,
getting that girl to hospital.

27:28.460 --> 27:32.460
And I heard you got
her first account too, so well done.

27:35.660 --> 27:38.460
CCTV has Kovacs getting
into a high-end Beamer

27:38.460 --> 27:40.460
a few streets from the flat.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.460
They should be able to nab him
pretty soon.

27:42.460 --> 27:45.460
Good. He's a bastard.

27:45.460 --> 27:46.820
I heard he pulled a gun on you.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.460
Till he's nicked, you be careful.
OK?

27:53.460 --> 27:54.980
OK.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.460
You and Hadley have a talk?

28:02.660 --> 28:05.460
OK. I won't ask again.

28:05.460 --> 28:08.460
He's big enough
to look after himself, I'm sorry.

28:09.460 --> 28:12.500
You should head back to the station,
finish up and go home.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.460
Tell Hadley too.

28:14.460 --> 28:18.140
I promised Cosmina
I'd be here when she came out.

28:18.140 --> 28:20.300
OK, Mother Teresa.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.460
After that, you go home.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.460
Or you can come round...

28:47.460 --> 28:49.460
Jack.
Alice.

28:49.460 --> 28:52.460
This is Sarah Collins.
You wanna talk about Lizzie Adama?

28:52.460 --> 28:54.460
Yeah.
What a clusterfuck.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.460
Hey, Hadley?

29:00.460 --> 29:04.460
I just saw the guv. He said soon as
we're done, we should clock off.

29:08.460 --> 29:10.460
No... No...

29:10.460 --> 29:12.460
Lizzie.
No...

29:33.460 --> 29:37.460
Apparently,
it was a... cerebral haemorrhage.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.460
There was nothing they could do.

29:42.460 --> 29:44.300
He killed her.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.460
Yeah.

29:47.460 --> 29:52.460
The, erm... murder squad
are taking over.

29:52.460 --> 29:55.460
We have to ID the body,
then give our statements.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.460
You up for that
or do you wanna delay?

30:01.460 --> 30:02.460
I'm up for it.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.460
You said it was a clusterfuck. Why?

30:12.460 --> 30:14.460
Well, where to begin?

30:14.460 --> 30:16.500
They got a member of the public
to put the door in,

30:16.500 --> 30:18.460
then they let a witness
into the crime scene,

30:18.460 --> 30:22.460
and how they got the girl
into the ambulance, Jesus...

30:22.460 --> 30:23.500
How did they?

30:23.500 --> 30:26.460
Pick the story up,
so PC Matthews comes back,

30:26.460 --> 30:27.460
Cosmina's refusing to leave.

30:27.460 --> 30:32.460
Then PC Matthews switches off
his BWV, and Cosmina ends up here.

30:32.460 --> 30:33.460
In ICU.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.460
So how did you manage that?

30:38.460 --> 30:39.460
Lizzie?

30:40.460 --> 30:41.460
How did you manage that?

30:41.460 --> 30:43.460
Erm...

30:44.460 --> 30:47.660
Hadley said he'd section her
under the Mental Health Act.

30:47.660 --> 30:49.460
What?

30:49.460 --> 30:52.460
Section her. A danger to herself.

30:54.460 --> 30:57.460
She was refusing to go to hospital.

30:57.460 --> 31:00.460
Kovacs could've come back any second
and killed her.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.460
He did fucking kill her.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.460
I explained to her
that a murder case

31:06.460 --> 31:08.460
is a whole other level of scrutiny.

31:08.460 --> 31:11.460
The defence are looking
for anything to hurt the case,

31:11.460 --> 31:12.460
like her missing BWV,

31:12.460 --> 31:15.460
or a threatening to section
the victim.

31:15.460 --> 31:16.820
How do you explain
all that to a judge?

31:16.820 --> 31:18.460
Then there's all the other stuff.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.460
Sorry.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.460
Hello?

31:22.460 --> 31:23.460
What other stuff?

31:23.460 --> 31:26.460
Well, the complaint
against PC Matthews and her.

31:26.460 --> 31:27.460
Racist language.

31:28.460 --> 31:31.460
Mehenni.
That's why you're here, isn't it?

31:31.460 --> 31:32.500
If the defence had got hold of
that...

31:32.500 --> 31:35.460
You told her it would damage
the case? Well, it would have.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.660
Thank God it's gone away.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.460
Racist language?

31:38.460 --> 31:41.460
Boo-bloody-hoo.
We're trying to convict a killer.

31:50.820 --> 31:52.460
Guess who that was.

31:52.460 --> 31:53.980
Younes Mehenni.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.460
He saw Bailie on TV. He's furious.

31:56.460 --> 31:59.460
Says we're turning Lizzie Adama
into a saint.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.460
He says she is not a saint,
not by a long shot.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.460
Does that mean he'll talk to us?
Yeah.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.460
As I've often said...

32:18.460 --> 32:22.460
the 999 breakfast,
one of the Met's finest...

32:22.460 --> 32:25.460
I told the murder squad that
you threatened to section Cosmina.

32:26.460 --> 32:27.460
What?

32:28.460 --> 32:29.820
Are you serious?

32:38.460 --> 32:40.460
Lizzie, I specially turned
my camera off, so it wouldn't...

32:40.460 --> 32:42.460
Yeah, I know.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.460
I'm sorry.

32:46.460 --> 32:48.460
But that's not all.

32:48.460 --> 32:52.460
They said that
the Mehenni complaint hurt the case.

32:52.460 --> 32:57.460
That...
Kovacs might get away with it...

32:58.460 --> 33:01.300
..that he might fucking walk...
All right, just...

33:01.300 --> 33:04.460
pull yourself together,
you're letting down the uniform.

33:05.460 --> 33:08.460
If you ever wondered why
we hate those bastards in suits,

33:08.460 --> 33:09.460
well, there's your answer.

33:09.460 --> 33:10.460
Oh, yeah, they always know best,

33:10.460 --> 33:13.460
but they're never there
when you've gotta put the door in.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.460
Here, didn't your mum and dad
teach you anything?

33:20.140 --> 33:22.460
And they'll have their fun.

33:22.460 --> 33:26.660
The solicitors, the press,
the know-nothings.

33:26.660 --> 33:28.980
They'll cast doubt...

33:30.460 --> 33:33.460
..criticise.
Won't make any difference.

33:33.460 --> 33:36.460
Kovacs killed Cosmina.

33:36.460 --> 33:37.460
We were the last people
she spoke to.

33:37.460 --> 33:39.980
You've got it all in your pocket
book. That's what counts.

33:41.460 --> 33:44.460
And when they catch this bastard,
which they will,

33:44.460 --> 33:46.460
he's going down for life.

33:47.460 --> 33:48.460
And that's what matters.

33:50.460 --> 33:53.460
And that's what we did. Hmm?

33:56.980 --> 33:58.140
Come on.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.460
Hmm?

34:05.460 --> 34:07.460
I was wrong to pressure you.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.820
Forget about it, OK? I'll be fine.

34:10.820 --> 34:12.460
OK.

34:12.460 --> 34:15.460
You're a good cop, Lizzie Adama.

34:17.140 --> 34:20.460
But if I were you, I'd finish up
here and I'd go straight home.

34:20.460 --> 34:24.460
Before I start confessing
to any unsolved murders or anything!

34:26.460 --> 34:28.460
Go on.

35:12.500 --> 35:15.460
"This is a statement
about arrest inquiries I made

35:15.460 --> 35:18.460
"with PC Hadley Matthews
at 7, Kenley Villas.

35:18.460 --> 35:21.820
"I have covered this matter
in an earlier statement,

35:21.820 --> 35:23.460
"but have been requested
by my inspector

35:23.460 --> 35:25.460
"to clarify one aspect
of these enquiries..."

35:32.460 --> 35:34.460
I did it.

35:35.460 --> 35:36.460
It's done.

35:40.460 --> 35:42.460
"I heard the whole conversation

35:42.460 --> 35:45.140
"between Farah Mehenni
and PC Matthews..."

35:51.980 --> 35:53.460
Shower.

35:54.460 --> 35:57.460
"He never said anything out of place

35:57.460 --> 35:59.500
"and certainly nothing
of a racist nature."

36:26.460 --> 36:29.460
PC Adama pretended to be our friend.

36:29.460 --> 36:33.460
She promised my daughter
she would make my charges go away...

36:33.460 --> 36:36.460
the charges
my neighbour Carrie Stoddard made.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.460
Why did she hate me so much?

36:39.980 --> 36:44.300
Really because of my rubbish bins
or the motorbike in the back?

36:45.460 --> 36:48.460
Maybe it was because of
the colour of my skin?

36:49.460 --> 36:51.460
We hadn't even been in the house
for one month

36:51.460 --> 36:54.460
and she'd already made complaints
to the housing officer.

36:54.460 --> 36:57.460
If that wasn't enough,
she then calls the police.

36:57.460 --> 36:59.820
This is when PC Adama
and the big policeman

36:59.820 --> 37:05.460
force their way into my house...
insult my daughter.

37:06.460 --> 37:10.460
She trusted PC Adama,
who lied about the law,

37:10.460 --> 37:12.460
and then lied
about what her friend did.

37:14.460 --> 37:15.460
She betrayed Farah.

37:16.660 --> 37:18.460
She killed my...

37:19.460 --> 37:21.460
Why are you not writing?

37:23.460 --> 37:25.140
You're not telling me anything.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.980
I'm gonna get some air.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.460
Yep?

38:06.460 --> 38:08.460
It's me.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.460
Lizzie, thank God.

38:10.460 --> 38:12.460
I'm turning myself in.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.460
No, wait, do not do that.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.460
'My face is bloody everywhere.'

38:16.460 --> 38:19.460
I'm going to. Sorry.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.460
'Lizzie, talk to me first.'

38:21.460 --> 38:22.820
Please.

38:23.980 --> 38:25.460
Where are you?

38:27.460 --> 38:29.460
Lizzie?

38:43.460 --> 38:45.460
Farah was a child.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.140
She should not be dead.

38:50.460 --> 38:53.460
But if you want me to find out why
she died, you will have to trust me.

38:55.460 --> 38:56.460
There is no point.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.460
I will never trust British police.

39:01.460 --> 39:03.460
You know,
you're not innocent here.

39:03.460 --> 39:06.140
Whatever Carrie did to you,
you did something to her.

39:06.140 --> 39:09.460
You keyed her car.
You made a threatening phone call.

39:09.460 --> 39:11.460
Those are criminal offences.

39:11.460 --> 39:14.460
You could've had a caution, that's
what PC Adama was offering you.

39:14.460 --> 39:17.300
All you had to do was admit what
you'd done and say you were sorry

39:17.300 --> 39:18.460
and that would've been
the end of it,

39:18.460 --> 39:20.300
but you couldn't do that, could you?

39:20.300 --> 39:23.460
And you brought Farah with you
when you were charged.

39:23.460 --> 39:25.460
It's all on the station CCTV.

39:25.460 --> 39:29.460
You give her the paperwork after
you've been remanded. Why did you?

39:29.460 --> 39:30.980
Bring her to the station,

39:30.980 --> 39:34.460
then hand her the papers,
like it was her responsibility?

39:34.460 --> 39:35.820
The poor lonely girl.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.500
It's no wonder she broke.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.460
Why did you put it on her?
Why did you...?

39:42.460 --> 39:45.460
Well, say something, Mr Mehenni.

39:52.460 --> 39:53.460
It's my fault.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.980
It's my fault.

40:04.460 --> 40:06.460
It's my fault.

40:06.460 --> 40:09.660
Yes, it's your fault.

40:11.140 --> 40:12.460
But it's not only yours.

40:12.460 --> 40:14.980
If you help me,
I will do everything in my power

40:14.980 --> 40:17.460
to find out what sent Farah
up that tower,

40:17.460 --> 40:19.460
but you have to talk to me.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.460
Please.

40:22.460 --> 40:23.820
What have you got to lose?

40:28.460 --> 40:30.460
The big policeman.

40:30.460 --> 40:32.460
He took her phone.

40:33.460 --> 40:35.300
He took her phone.

40:43.460 --> 40:44.820
I'm gonna go for a run, all right?
Mm-hm.

40:49.660 --> 40:51.460
Hello?

40:51.460 --> 40:53.460
'PC Adama?'

40:53.460 --> 40:55.460
This is Farah Mehenni.

40:57.460 --> 40:59.460
Farah.

40:59.460 --> 41:02.460
You shouldn't be calling me.
'But you gave me your number.'

41:03.460 --> 41:06.460
Yeah, yeah, but...
but that was to help.

41:06.460 --> 41:10.140
Please... please listen to me...

41:11.460 --> 41:16.460
My dad said his lawyer told him you
made a statement. A new statement.

41:16.460 --> 41:19.460
'Now he's got to go back in,
he's going to be charged.'

41:20.500 --> 41:23.460
It's a minor offence, all right?
He'll be OK.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.140
We could lose our house.

41:26.140 --> 41:27.660
Farah, that's not gonna happen.

41:27.660 --> 41:31.460
My dad says you heard
what the other policeman said.

41:31.460 --> 41:36.460
'But you couldn't have.
You were in the back yard.'

41:36.460 --> 41:39.460
Well, that's not how I remember it.

41:39.460 --> 41:41.460
'I trusted you, PC Adama.'

41:41.460 --> 41:44.460
You said we could work this out,
you promised.

41:44.460 --> 41:48.460
Farah... there isn't
a deal to be made here, OK?

41:48.460 --> 41:51.460
It's happened. It's done.

41:51.460 --> 41:52.820
So your dad will just have to face
the...

41:52.820 --> 41:54.460
No, he won't.

41:57.980 --> 42:00.460
I had my phone on in my pocket.

42:02.460 --> 42:05.140
'I recorded
everything your friend said.

42:07.460 --> 42:09.460
'Little Miss Jihadi.

42:12.460 --> 42:13.980
'Mohammed Bin Laden.

42:16.460 --> 42:19.460
'So you have to help me now,
don't you, PC Adama?'

42:22.980 --> 42:26.460
There's a place I walk past
every day, Portland Tower.

42:29.660 --> 42:31.460
We could meet there.

42:37.460 --> 42:42.140
You know, we are taught
that every soul will taste death.

42:44.460 --> 42:45.820
This is my daughter.

42:48.300 --> 42:49.460
This is Farah.

43:04.460 --> 43:07.460
Yes, Steve?
'Sarah, at bloody last.'

43:07.460 --> 43:09.660
Lizzie's phone pinged an hour ago,
just outside Eastbourne.

43:09.660 --> 43:11.460
'Great. Did she call anyone?'

43:11.460 --> 43:14.460
Half an hour ago, DI Shaw called.
Says she'd phoned him.

43:14.460 --> 43:15.980
He said
he told her to hand herself in.

43:15.980 --> 43:19.460
Where was he?
Driving home. His house near Lewes.

43:20.460 --> 43:21.460
He's going to meet her.

43:21.460 --> 43:23.460
Yeah, that's what we think, so...

43:23.460 --> 43:26.460
Listen. Farah recorded what Hadley
Matthews said to her on her phone.

43:27.460 --> 43:29.460
'Farah told Lizzie Adama.'

43:29.460 --> 43:32.300
Lizzie must've told Hadley
because he waited for Farah

43:32.300 --> 43:33.460
at Portland Tower
the day before they died

43:33.460 --> 43:35.460
and he took the phone
right out of her hands.

43:35.460 --> 43:37.140
That's why she took the kid.

43:37.140 --> 43:39.460
'Exactly. And it's why
DI Shaw went to Hadley's locker

43:39.460 --> 43:41.460
'in the middle
of the tower incident.'

43:41.460 --> 43:43.300
We've gotta find that phone.

43:43.300 --> 43:45.460
We need a warrant for Shaw,
his homes, his vehicles.

43:45.460 --> 43:47.460
Be a fight to get it through Bailie.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.460
This time, I'll fucking win.

43:59.460 --> 44:01.660
A section eight warrant.
Are you serious?

44:01.660 --> 44:03.140
Yes, Sir.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.460
DI Shaw has
Farah Mehenni's mobile phone.

44:05.460 --> 44:08.460
And you believe this because
of what Farah's father told you?

44:08.460 --> 44:10.460
I know this.
It's the only explanation

44:10.460 --> 44:11.980
that makes sense
of DI Shaw's actions.

44:11.980 --> 44:16.460
But you don't have evidence.
It's hearsay, from a biased source.

44:17.460 --> 44:19.500
Why are you fixated
on pursuing Shaw?

44:19.500 --> 44:21.460
Why are you fixated
on defending him?

44:22.460 --> 44:24.460
Be very careful, Sarah.

44:25.460 --> 44:27.460
The answer's no.

44:27.460 --> 44:28.460
No warrant.

44:29.460 --> 44:32.660
You know, eventually,
Lizzie Adama will come in.

44:32.660 --> 44:35.460
She will tell us what happened
on top of the tower

44:35.460 --> 44:37.460
between PC Matthews
and Farah Mehenni.

44:37.460 --> 44:38.460
What are you talking about?

44:40.460 --> 44:42.820
If PC Matthews was prepared to take,
by force,

44:42.820 --> 44:45.460
a mobile phone
from a teenage girl...

44:45.460 --> 44:46.820
what else might he have done?

44:46.820 --> 44:48.820
Up there on the roof,

44:48.820 --> 44:52.460
facing the end of his career,
the loss of his good name.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.660
Like I said, it will come out.

44:56.500 --> 45:00.460
And if the Met and certain senior
officers are found to have impeded

45:00.460 --> 45:02.500
my investigation
with its racial component, well...

45:04.460 --> 45:06.460
..can you imagine the shitstorm?

45:12.460 --> 45:13.460
You've got your warrant.

45:15.460 --> 45:16.820
You'd better find that phone.

45:33.500 --> 45:35.660
