WEBVTT

00:10.969 --> 00:11.803
Thanks.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.264
That's good, Alta.

00:14.764 --> 00:18.810
I thought he was staying for one night,
but it seems his stay is indefinite.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.603
I'm the lady of the house.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.648
I pay your wages,
so I'm asking you not to serve him.

00:23.732 --> 00:24.858
Don't worry, Alta.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.860
Ramón has it covered.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.031
-Your breakfast, sir.
-Thanks.

00:31.614 --> 00:35.493
Ramón, from this moment on,
you can't drive her around

00:35.577 --> 00:37.579
or do any kind of errands for her.

00:38.329 --> 00:41.291
So I can't give her this envelope
that arrived for her?

00:41.374 --> 00:42.250
I'll give it to her.

00:45.795 --> 00:46.755
Excuse me.

00:46.838 --> 00:47.797
Thank you.

00:50.675 --> 00:54.429
I bought some more rash ointment.
I noticed you were out.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.931
How was your weekend with Ferrán?

00:57.015 --> 00:59.309
Ferrán is really sorry
about what happened.

00:59.809 --> 01:03.021
He says you can go back
to the co-work whenever you want.

01:03.104 --> 01:03.938
No.

01:05.148 --> 01:08.276
I'm doing my presentation
at the investors' office.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.569
Okay.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.362
So, you and me,

01:12.572 --> 01:13.948
can we patch things up?

01:14.032 --> 01:16.409
Sure. Of course we can.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.217
MEXICO CITY FAMILY COURT

01:32.801 --> 01:34.052
Are you serious?

01:35.678 --> 01:37.138
You're suing me.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.766
You wanted to set clear boundaries.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.810
This is ridiculous.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.061
Better safe than sorry.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.395
Don't you trust me?

01:44.479 --> 01:45.814
I never expected this from you.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.004
A NETFLIX SERIES

03:07.395 --> 03:08.938
-Hello.
-Hi.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.273
Can I leave her with you?

03:10.356 --> 03:11.524
Of course.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.692
Thanks.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.444
Hi, beautiful.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.155
-These are her things.
-Thanks.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.449
-Say bye.
-Bye, Regis.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.578
I just can't believe
Pablo's suing me again!

03:23.661 --> 03:25.955
At least he's not in your house

03:26.039 --> 03:27.582
making your life miserable.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.167
They're acting like children.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.752
They're throwing a tantrum.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.339
He says he wants to negotiate
his time with Regina.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.633
That's very important.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.802
You have to get the girls' birthdays,

03:39.886 --> 03:42.055
Mother's Day, Easter.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.058
Those are forever memories.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.268
Photo album material.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.481
And Christmas,
we must spend it together as a family.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.899
They're important dates.

03:52.982 --> 03:56.486
Why don't we talk to Laura Villa
and ask her to take both our cases?

03:57.195 --> 03:58.613
That won't be necessary.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.574
I can still talk it out with Pablo.
Well, I hope so.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.701
Sorry, but speaking of important dates,

04:03.785 --> 04:07.288
Marcela asked if we could do
the presentation earlier.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.998
What presentation?

04:09.082 --> 04:09.916
For the app.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.085
She's a majority partner.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.212
She wants to okay everything
before the launch.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.005
Do you think she'll like everything?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.466
No, but she trusts me.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.386
I'm sure I can get her to okay everything.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.847
You and Santamarina were smart
to beat her to the punch.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.016
I don't know. I'm not so sure.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.227
Ana was really upset.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.812
What else did you expect?

04:31.312 --> 04:33.564
Trust your lawyer.
He knows what he's doing.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.483
I just feel so guilty.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.489
In a divorce, guilt is your worst enemy.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.826
I think you're fighting
for something legitimate.

04:44.909 --> 04:48.788
You're protecting your legacy,
the house you built.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.750
<i>The situation is too tense.</i>

04:52.834 --> 04:55.628
Plus, I hate being caught
between you and Mariana.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.423
I never meant for any of that to happen.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.134
You're getting time off
pretty soon, right?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.470
What if we go camping at the beach?

05:04.554 --> 05:08.224
Just you and me. Away from it all.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.227
Yes. Wow, I love that plan.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.145
Okay, it's done.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.647
I'll ask Mariana to watch
the penguin for a few days.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.070
I wanted to spend my birthday
at Tomorrowland.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.613
Now they're getting divorced.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.160
Come on, Ro.
You'll see it's not a big deal.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.664
Olivia says it's really cool
having divorced parents.

05:31.748 --> 05:36.919
You get twice as much of everything.
Houses, holidays, presents.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.339
You might even get to go
to Tomorrowland twice.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.716
You don't get it.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.344
All I want is to stop feeling
like I'm being torn apart.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.430
Don't be so dramatic, Ro.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.391
It won't be as bad as you think.
You'll see.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.101
Cheer up.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.521
It's not the end of the world.
We have time to hit back.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.565
He's throwing a tantrum.

05:57.648 --> 06:03.029
Ana, Juan Carlos moving back
is strategic, not a tantrum.

06:03.112 --> 06:05.698
He wants to prevent you
from claiming home abandonment.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.117
Now they're going after
the marital household.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.078
He wants to keep the house?

06:10.161 --> 06:10.995
Worse.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.623
He wants you to pay him alimony

06:13.706 --> 06:16.334
and follow the visitation schedule.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.003
That's ridiculous.
No judge will grant that.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.880
Santamarina is heartless,

06:20.963 --> 06:23.841
and he has plenty of friends
in family court.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.010
What should I do?

06:26.094 --> 06:28.679
Give me any argument I can use to prove

06:28.763 --> 06:32.392
Juan Carlos is unfit
to care for the kids or the house.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.644
Oh, this is very important.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.564
You can't talk to him at all,
even if he lives in your house.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.149
<i>I'm asking you for those dates</i>

06:40.233 --> 06:42.777
and for you to take Regina.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.570
Okay.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.533
That's fine, but I'd like to spend
Christmas with Regina.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.704
You don't celebrate Christmas
because it's a capitalist ploy.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.665
I've changed my mind, Pablo.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.543
-I want it to be a family tradition.
-Really?

06:58.626 --> 06:59.544
What's wrong?

06:59.627 --> 07:02.797
You want Regina to spend Christmas
with Ferrán instead of me?

07:02.880 --> 07:05.508
No. I want to spend it
with Ana and Valentina.

07:05.591 --> 07:09.804
Ana will shower them with gifts
and maybe get Ramón to dress up as Santa.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.849
She's spending Christmas with my family.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.935
What will your family do?
They're religious nuts.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.771
They'll probably sing Christmas carols

07:18.855 --> 07:22.316
and sing to baby Jesus
while they pray the rosary.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.278
They'll even give her sweets.
No, I won't allow it.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.821
I'm not backing down either.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.365
-I'm taking Regina, period.
-We'll see about that.

07:29.949 --> 07:34.495
And you know what? Tell your lawyer
we won't be changing the schedule.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.206
Deal's off.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.964
<i>Let's go on a trip. Wherever you want.</i>

07:45.590 --> 07:48.718
To the beach, Paris, New York. You choose.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.219
You're joking.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.888
Of course I'm not.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.349
You're free to do anything
when you don't have kids.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.059
You don't want kids?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.729
That's not what I'm saying.
I just enjoy my freedom.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.064
So where do you want to go?

08:02.565 --> 08:05.193
I don't know! How exciting!

08:06.152 --> 08:08.279
I've never crossed the border.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.573
Oh, I did once.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.909
-I went to El Paso.
-To El Paso?

08:12.992 --> 08:16.329
I'm sure it has its charms,
but why not Paris?

08:16.412 --> 08:17.914
-Paris?
-Sure.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.081
Paris as in--

08:19.165 --> 08:20.958
Paris, France. Yes.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.920
What? No. I mean--

08:25.004 --> 08:25.922
-It's just--
-What?

08:26.005 --> 08:28.216
-I'm dying to see Paris!
-Do you like it?

08:28.799 --> 08:30.426
Of course I do!

08:30.927 --> 08:32.345
I'm so excited!

08:32.428 --> 08:34.847
-I can't believe I'm going to Paris!
-Yes.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.766
<i>I thought we were going on a trip.</i>

08:36.849 --> 08:39.185
Pablo, I'm not going to get
any more time off.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.522
I know, I'm sorry. It's just that…

08:43.147 --> 08:46.359
Mariana will only trade dates
if I give her Christmas.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.028
Can't you change yours?

08:56.327 --> 08:58.829
It sounds like you're trying
to beat Mariana.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.749
No, I swear I'm not.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.962
All I want is to spend time
with my daughter.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.839
Then don't antagonize Mariana.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.301
It's easier for everyone
if you make up with her.

09:13.010 --> 09:13.928
No lawyers.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.596
Okay.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.808
I promise I'll fix it.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.396
<i>It's time to take the next step.</i>

09:25.898 --> 09:26.983
What?

09:27.066 --> 09:29.151
I want you to meet my friends.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.779
Let me know when you're free,
and I'll host a dinner party.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.740
I don't know how Pablo will take it.

09:35.866 --> 09:39.203
He's been really unreasonable.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.914
I don't want him to get angry
and use Regina as leverage.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.503
Are you serious, Mariana?

09:48.504 --> 09:52.550
Will our entire relationship
depend on how Pablo is feeling?

09:54.844 --> 09:57.221
If we go down that road,
it won't lead anywhere.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.642
You're right.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.313
Let's have the dinner party at my place.

10:05.813 --> 10:06.689
I'll even cook.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.609
-I'm a good cook, believe it or not.
-Really?

10:31.088 --> 10:33.215
I made it myself with my own hands.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.727
Ana, aren't you coming in?
Aren't you cooking--

10:48.564 --> 10:50.191
Divorce is a real tragedy.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.611
Olivia lives at her father's

10:53.694 --> 10:57.114
because he's way cooler than her mom.

10:59.408 --> 11:03.037
He let her travel with her boyfriend
when we were sophomores.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.083
What? Are you moving in with Olivia's dad?

11:08.542 --> 11:10.086
Ceci, I've been thinking.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.923
That boy Darío seems like a nice kid.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.092
Mom, he's really nice.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.637
I guess you might as well
go on a trip with him.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.889
You're really letting me
travel with Darío?

11:22.515 --> 11:25.142
I mean, you already bought
the plane ticket.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.147
You're the best mom ever.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.527
<i>I saw it coming.</i>

11:35.695 --> 11:38.656
We both knew
she'd ask Laura to take the case

11:38.739 --> 11:39.990
and file a counterclaim.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.492
What?

11:42.034 --> 11:45.496
-Did you think she'd do nothing?
-No, but this is--

11:45.579 --> 11:47.957
This is what you need to negotiate.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.167
You said Ana wouldn't talk to you.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.461
This is an open channel.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.507
All I want is to get my family back.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.718
Your family will always be your family,

11:58.801 --> 12:00.594
regardless of the divorce.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.680
Family is forever.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.348
A broken family?

12:04.432 --> 12:05.558
What can I say?

12:06.225 --> 12:07.560
Marriage doesn't work,

12:07.643 --> 12:13.566
but compromising for respectful,
relaxed, and free relationships

12:13.649 --> 12:15.025
does work.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.611
And the best part? Renewable every year.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.324
Ask to take Regina on a day
that's important to Mariana.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.827
What's more important than Christmas?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.162
The soccer final.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.998
Dude, are you going to help me
or keep making jokes?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.332
Mother's Day!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.668
Tell her you want to take Regina.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.795
Please, no way.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.506
I promised Cynthia I'd fix it.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.050
Doing that would backfire.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.678
Well, let me remind you
that she started it.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.263
And badly, bro.

12:46.348 --> 12:49.226
<i>Imagine me walking around</i>
<i>the streets of Paris.</i>

12:49.977 --> 12:52.897
<i>Voulez-vous coucher</i> this.
<i>Voulez-vous coucher </i>that.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.691
-I'm so thrilled!
-That's really great.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.943
Turn the AC down. I'm cold.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.030
How are you cold?
It's like an oven in here.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.365
It feels like the subway during rush hour.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.826
I agree. It's cold. Please turn it down.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.995
Well-- Oh, sorry.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.455
-We'll turn it down.
-Thanks.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.873
You do look sweaty.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.458
I'm burning up.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.877
-You sweat like this at night?
-Yes.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.254
-Have you put on weight?
-Yes, can you tell?

13:17.338 --> 13:19.715
Are you feeling tired?
Are your boobs sore?

13:20.549 --> 13:23.761
Yeah, they're really swollen.
Hush, the customers will hear you.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.513
Don't mind me.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.640
Sorry, sir. We'll turn down the AC.

13:27.723 --> 13:28.724
Yes, please. Thanks.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.643
Do you think I'm sick?

13:30.726 --> 13:32.937
It may be a hormonal imbalance.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.355
Don't scare me.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.191
Hey, I went through
the same stuff before the myoma.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.400
Just go to the doctor.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.786
-I need to talk to Mariana.
-She's not home, but come in.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.504
Pablo, I owe you an apology
for our fight at the co-work.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.005
You don't owe me anything.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.467
I don't like my kid
being left with a total stranger.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.469
-I'll take her.
-Go with your dad.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.513
Come, sweetie. What's up?

14:07.596 --> 14:09.306
Pablo, what are you doing here?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.433
Why weren't you with Regina?

14:11.517 --> 14:14.103
I went to the grocery store
to buy some parsley.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.439
I always confuse parsley and cilantro, so…

14:17.523 --> 14:21.360
Also, Ferrán isn't a total stranger.
Regina knows him really well.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.362
Regina is just a baby, Mariana.

14:23.445 --> 14:26.156
She doesn't know the kind of people
you leave her with.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.410
You can defend yourself,
but she can't. Right?

14:29.493 --> 14:31.495
Come on, Pablo! Defend myself from what?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.038
That's your problem.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.040
I should get going.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.792
-No!
-Thanks.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.170
No, we're having dinner with your friends.

14:40.254 --> 14:44.258
We can do it some other time
when things have settled.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.267
-Seriously?
-What?

14:53.350 --> 14:54.602
You're a jerk.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.770
You're being awful.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.732
I came because I wanted to make peace,

14:59.815 --> 15:02.026
but I see that's impossible.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.528
If you want to make peace,
don't get a lawyer.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.322
Just let me have Christmas.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.157
Fine, you take Christmas,

15:08.240 --> 15:09.491
but I want Mother's Day.

15:10.534 --> 15:13.245
Pablo, I'm her mom!

15:13.329 --> 15:14.622
You get Father's Day.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.916
Who cares about Father's Day?
I want Christmas!

15:16.999 --> 15:19.501
Listen, I don't want to argue.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.045
You're being unreasonable.

15:21.795 --> 15:25.174
I think you should leave.
Have your lawyer call mine.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.926
All right, then.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.598
<i>"Emotionally unstable man.</i>"

15:33.807 --> 15:36.894
"Chronic cheater
who finds his mistresses online."

15:38.312 --> 15:42.942
"Had extra-marital relations
with at least two women in the past year."

15:45.402 --> 15:49.031
"Exerted psychological violence
on his spouse."

15:50.157 --> 15:51.909
"Abandoned his children."

15:52.743 --> 15:55.579
"And leads a double life
in a bachelor pad."

15:55.663 --> 15:56.705
Should I keep going?

15:59.249 --> 16:00.709
I'm only defending myself.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.128
You're the one who filed for divorce.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.383
The divorce was your idea!

16:08.092 --> 16:10.678
And now you have the gall
to go after my house.

16:10.761 --> 16:14.306
Excuse me, but on the advice of counsel,
I can't talk to you.

16:14.974 --> 16:15.808
Ana.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.309
Ana.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.397
At least toss me a pillow.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.860
<i>He's so stubborn.</i>

16:26.944 --> 16:29.113
<i>He wants Christmas just to prove a point.</i>

16:29.196 --> 16:30.614
Same as Juan Carlos.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.951
He even said
it was my idea to get a divorce.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.411
But it was, right?

16:35.494 --> 16:36.620
Which backfired.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.832
Not only is he back,
he's trying to take my house.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.209
Why is it so hard to understand

16:42.292 --> 16:44.962
we only want what's best for our kids?

16:45.045 --> 16:48.173
Now we're not talking,
and I have to get a lawyer.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.050
Laura can do it. I'll talk to her.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.594
Honestly, screw Pablo. I hate him!

16:55.431 --> 16:56.432
What?

17:01.812 --> 17:02.980
Cynthia?

17:03.063 --> 17:06.191
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.194
My bad. I shouldn't speak ill of Pablo
in your presence.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.697
Mariana, I really admire you.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.574
If it weren't for all of this,

17:13.657 --> 17:15.034
we could even be friends.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.286
-But this is all too--
-I know.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.662
I feel the same way.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.372
I admire you too.

17:21.623 --> 17:25.878
I think it may be for the best
if we don't talk about that stuff.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.671
Yeah, that sounds great.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.381
Okay, then.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.385
<i>I don't want Ana to hate me.</i>

17:33.469 --> 17:37.056
She'll hate you either way.
At least for a while, Juan Carlos.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.433
If we don't fight this,

17:40.350 --> 17:44.354
it will be you who'll hate her
once you've lost everything.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.940
Fine, what do I do?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.735
We must prove

17:49.818 --> 17:53.322
it's you and not Ana
who's entitled to the house.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.448
What?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.158
Come in.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.117
Thanks.

17:57.951 --> 17:58.827
Hello.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.121
You're just in time.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.582
For what?

18:04.792 --> 18:05.626
Sit.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.255
You need to tell me
everything you know about them.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.882
Everything.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.675
Even the slightest detail

18:14.259 --> 18:15.636
may be helpful.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.767
Ana cheated on me.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.813
And, well,

18:25.896 --> 18:28.607
there was a weird situation
between Ana and Mariana.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.950
<i>It couldn't be worse.</i>

18:38.033 --> 18:40.327
What if he gets Christmas
and Mother's Day?

18:40.410 --> 18:42.287
He might as well get full custody!

18:42.371 --> 18:45.415
Don't worry about that.
He said it out of anger.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.458
He got heated.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.503
Look who's talking.
Have you seen a gynecologist?

18:50.629 --> 18:51.505
What's wrong?

18:51.588 --> 18:53.715
Nothing, premature menopause.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.093
Same thing happened to me.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.302
It runs in the family.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.513
Mom, please. I don't know yet.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.056
Don't take it hard.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.267
It's just another stage as a woman.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.853
Right, the stage
where you can't have babies.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.396
You want more kids?

19:07.980 --> 19:11.233
Can you picture me with a sibling
the same age as Regina?

19:11.316 --> 19:13.152
-Oh no.
-No, of course not.

19:13.902 --> 19:17.573
The truth is I'm really happy
with the freedom I have.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.120
-Can I tell you something?
-Please.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.416
Víctor wants to take me on a trip…

19:29.793 --> 19:30.669
to Paris!

19:33.130 --> 19:34.798
So you're officially dating?

19:36.341 --> 19:37.217
Yeah.

19:39.011 --> 19:44.391
Yeah, and I don't want it to be
a problem between us.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.518
It has nothing to do with Juan Carlos.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.520
Other than him being his brother.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.773
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.109
Here's the point, Mariana.

19:54.193 --> 19:58.030
I really want things to work
between Víctor and me,

19:58.572 --> 19:59.823
business aside.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.827
I thought I'd never
have the guts to tell you!

20:04.536 --> 20:06.747
Your mother deserves this, Mariana.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.916
She's doing things right.

20:08.999 --> 20:09.958
Oh, Mom.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.210
Oh, Teresa.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.795
What else can I say?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.674
I'm proud of you.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.802
Go on and enjoy your trip. You deserve it.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.679
Thank you, sweetie.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.682
You don't know how happy I am
that we're close again.

20:27.517 --> 20:28.894
Do you really trust Igor?

20:29.519 --> 20:31.772
I think he's a little aggressive.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.858
Being on bad terms with her
would be the worst for Regina.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.027
I don't want Ana to hate me either,

20:37.110 --> 20:40.072
but if we want to be present
in our daughters' lives,

20:40.572 --> 20:43.784
better safe than sorry.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.370
They always get their way
when it comes to the babies.

20:46.912 --> 20:51.458
-They didn't consult us on the baptism.
-Or when Mariana moved in.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.669
If they don't consult us for that stuff,

20:53.752 --> 20:58.131
we won't get a say regarding their school
or what they're allowed to do.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.176
Or holidays or important days with them.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.552
Or who gets to watch your baby.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.351
Mariana keeps leaving Regina with Ferrán
as if he were her dad.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.271
Plus, she wants Christmas.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.273
See? They're not being fair.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.524
Sorry,

21:16.233 --> 21:17.609
but we did the right thing.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.861
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

21:21.321 --> 21:22.990
Pablo filed a new claim.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.494
Now he wants to have the final say

21:27.577 --> 21:30.872
on how I spend time with Regina.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.334
He claims I put her in a situation

21:34.418 --> 21:37.337
that was "unwholesome,
unusual, and inappropriate."

21:37.421 --> 21:41.466
Sorry, but if he's talking about
me being gay and us living together,

21:41.550 --> 21:44.803
there's a name for that,
and it's homophobia.

21:44.886 --> 21:49.933
He says the baby and I moved
to a total stranger's house,

21:50.017 --> 21:53.770
and I "endangered
Regina's physical well-being."

21:54.271 --> 21:55.647
Dude, what the hell?

21:55.731 --> 21:58.275
Fuck! How dare he?

21:58.358 --> 22:01.236
Pablo's apartment is more dangerous

22:01.320 --> 22:03.447
than Ana's neuroses. Screw him.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.409
He's coming.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.870
Look, Ro.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.873
This is the hotel in Amsterdam
we're staying at.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.417
I told you mom said I could go, right?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.627
Mom's the best, right?

22:17.711 --> 22:19.171
Obviously. Look.

22:20.630 --> 22:24.051
I'm glad you're going on that trip.
I was going to let you go anyway.

22:25.385 --> 22:29.890
I think we can forgive
your plane ticket debt.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.392
You're 18 now.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.312
Why don't I get you
a credit card for the trip?

22:36.521 --> 22:38.315
You're the best dad ever.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.068
Come.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.284
"A bad influence"?

22:49.910 --> 22:52.037
"A stranger
who talked her into doing drugs

22:52.120 --> 22:54.998
and having lesbian sex in her own house"?

22:55.082 --> 22:56.583
That's just lawyer talk.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.168
That stranger is Mariana.

22:58.251 --> 23:01.171
She's the best thing
that's happened to me in the past year.

23:01.254 --> 23:02.381
She and the girls.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.133
Your tantrum is out of control!

23:05.217 --> 23:07.135
It's not a tantrum!

23:07.677 --> 23:09.971
The kids and this house are my life.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.808
This house is proof
of everything I've built over the years.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.645
I also built everything you see in here.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.691
In fact, I bought that couch.

23:21.775 --> 23:22.734
Get up.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.197
Well, I bought the rug. Don't step on it.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.369
All right, fine. If that's what you want.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.710
You can't use any of the things
I bought for this house.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.505
I bought this one.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.257
I bought this.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.426
I bought this table.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.428
This one too.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.054
I bought the lamps.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.306
This vase is mine.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.850
The floor.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.309
-I bought it.
-I bought it.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.353
We both chipped in.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.063
We'll split it.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.064
Equal parts.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.199
Don't think Altagracia
will clean your side

24:11.283 --> 24:13.368
because I sign her checks.

24:14.035 --> 24:16.663
No, Ana. Wait. That's not fair.

24:16.746 --> 24:17.706
Ana!

24:36.475 --> 24:38.768
<i>How could you let things escalate so much?</i>

24:39.269 --> 24:42.606
How dare you try to take
my daughter from me?

24:42.689 --> 24:45.317
Or dictate terms for me to see her.
I'm not a menace.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.528
That's not it. I just want
to be present in my daughter's life.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.739
But you've made decisions alone,

24:50.822 --> 24:53.492
like christening her or living with Ana.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.577
When I moved in with Ana,

24:55.660 --> 24:57.537
you weren't even in Regina's life!

24:58.455 --> 25:00.832
Ever since you came back,
we've been a team.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.501
You and me, man.

25:03.084 --> 25:07.172
I know we've had fights
about money, work, you name it.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.966
But never about Regina!

25:10.050 --> 25:11.593
This is crazy.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.222
It's almost as if
you don't want me to be happy.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.774
-Look, Mariana--
-Don't.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.529
If we don't get everything in writing,

25:30.612 --> 25:32.614
we're going to keep fighting.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.159
We might even end up hating each other.

25:36.243 --> 25:40.205
It's better to be safe than sorry.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.123
Fuck you.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.091
<i>I'll never forgive him.</i>

25:51.174 --> 25:53.718
I can't believe the lies
he's telling about me.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.596
Are you sure they're all lies?

25:58.265 --> 26:00.100
Ana, this is serious.

26:00.600 --> 26:04.604
Igor is an expert
at manipulating half-truths.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.607
He's accusing you of infidelity.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.610
-Did you cheat on him?
-Just once.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.613
And I told him right away.
A courtesy he didn't return.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.491
Did you do drugs

26:16.992 --> 26:19.160
and kiss Mariana in your own home?

26:20.161 --> 26:23.206
That's not as black-and-white as it seems.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.876
When it comes to the law,
there are no gray areas, Ana.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.713
It's either black or white.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.341
Only facts matter.

26:33.425 --> 26:37.512
As far as the judge goes,
he'll think you cheated,

26:37.596 --> 26:41.600
did drugs, and began a relationship
with a young woman who, on top of it all,

26:41.683 --> 26:45.270
you moved into the house
without Juan Carlos's consent.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.981
These arguments are enough

26:48.064 --> 26:51.484
for Juan Carlos to ask for full custody.

26:52.485 --> 26:53.403
What?

26:54.237 --> 26:55.655
No, he'd never do that.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.991
Juan Carlos wouldn't, but Igor would.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.326
Trust me.

26:59.409 --> 27:03.413
So what's next? How do we counter-attack?

27:03.496 --> 27:05.582
Let me think. I don't know…

27:06.791 --> 27:08.168
Are you and Mariana…

27:09.544 --> 27:10.795
Are you a lesbian?

27:12.172 --> 27:13.298
No!

27:13.882 --> 27:16.968
If you were, I could build a case
against Juan Carlos

27:17.052 --> 27:20.597
for gender discrimination
and homophobic slander.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.766
With the right evidence and judge,

27:23.266 --> 27:24.601
we could totally win this.

27:25.935 --> 27:29.814
If that's not the case, forget it.
I don't like using the gay flag in vain.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.150
Is there any other option?

27:32.233 --> 27:36.237
To counter this latest claim,
there's only one thing I can think of.

27:37.447 --> 27:41.660
You and Mariana
need to avoid contact completely.

27:42.535 --> 27:43.536
For how long?

27:44.245 --> 27:45.997
Six months, at least.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.541
I don't know. Until we win this.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.418
That's too long.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.463
We can't possibly do that.
We have too much in common.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.090
The girls, our business.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.675
There's no other way.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.552
If this case goes to court,

27:59.636 --> 28:02.180
we'll need hard evidence

28:02.722 --> 28:06.267
to prove you followed
social services' recommendations.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.896
It's that or you lose everything.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.444
We're almost there. Just trust me.

28:17.612 --> 28:18.905
And…

28:20.740 --> 28:21.825
open your eyes.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.163
What's this?

28:28.498 --> 28:30.291
It's a surprise.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.504
Is this a surprise or your way
of telling me the trip is off?

28:36.172 --> 28:38.675
Do you really need to take
Christmas from Mariana?

28:40.468 --> 28:42.846
I'm sorry, I was trying to be romantic.

28:42.929 --> 28:45.348
Don't worry, I'm going to the beach.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.143
Alone or not.

28:57.068 --> 29:00.029
In six months, the babies
won't even remember us.

29:01.531 --> 29:02.615
I know, but

29:03.241 --> 29:05.076
Laura says it's the only way.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.495
Time flies by.

29:08.496 --> 29:09.539
You'll see.

29:11.124 --> 29:15.044
Before we know it,
they'll be playing together again.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.183
I also asked Laura to draft this document.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.643
It says I'm giving up my share of the app.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.937
-What?
-It's yours.

29:33.521 --> 29:34.689
It's for the best.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.691
From now on, I'm out.

29:37.525 --> 29:40.069
I can't do it alone. I need you.

29:41.404 --> 29:44.365
What about Marcela and the presentation?

29:44.991 --> 29:48.369
You know everything you need to know
to do the presentation.

29:49.746 --> 29:54.292
Marcela will have to understand
you two are the only partners.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.342
I'm sorry I couldn't win this.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.561
Ana, please, open up.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.316
What do you want?

30:19.442 --> 30:21.945
You're the last person I want to talk to.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.951
What happened today was absurd, Ana.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.703
We acted like children.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.498
I'm sure we can fix this.

30:34.082 --> 30:37.126
Like telling lies about us
through our lawyers?

30:37.210 --> 30:40.213
Please understand,
I've felt dispossessed for weeks.

30:40.755 --> 30:44.676
You pushed me away
from our kids, our house,

30:44.759 --> 30:47.428
and the life I've spent years
trying to build.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.389
I didn't push you away from anything.

30:50.306 --> 30:53.226
I only separated from you
because I can't be with you.

30:53.309 --> 30:54.978
You're the love of my life.

30:55.061 --> 30:57.814
And you're the only man I've loved.

30:59.107 --> 31:02.443
But I don't know what to do
to make my heart trust you again.

31:04.737 --> 31:07.532
I'm sorry. I know I also hurt you,

31:08.741 --> 31:11.077
but this is bigger than me.
I just can't do it.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.750
I know we can work this out.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.544
Just let me try.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.880
Give me a chance.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.799
No.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.467
No, Juan Carlos.

31:28.344 --> 31:32.473
I don't think either of us
deserves to be anything but happy.

31:35.476 --> 31:39.439
Getting a divorce is the only way
to build something different.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.942
I don't know what, but different.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.527
I don't want to get a divorce.

31:45.486 --> 31:46.362
No.

31:46.863 --> 31:47.947
I'm sorry.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.751
I'm the one who's sorry.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.623
You look amazing, so professional.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.418
I hope Marcela agrees.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.587
-Yes.
-About looking professional.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.588
Yeah, of course.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.298
You'll do great.

32:47.924 --> 32:51.803
Will I look less professional
if I kiss you right now?

32:51.886 --> 32:55.181
I don't mind looking less professional.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.776
-I think I'm falling in love with you.
-I love you, Mariana.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.950
Go on. Get to your meeting
before I snatch you away.

33:14.701 --> 33:15.827
Okay, bye.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.329
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

33:19.706 --> 33:20.873
<i>We need to talk.</i>

33:22.166 --> 33:23.876
I've been taking advantage of you,

33:24.544 --> 33:26.004
and I know it was wrong.

33:27.547 --> 33:31.926
I guess part of me didn't want
to believe this was really happening.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.430
This divorce thing is painful for us.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.976
The only thing that's certain

33:41.102 --> 33:42.854
is that we love you.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.357
And we'll always be here for you.

33:47.942 --> 33:50.737
You're still the most important thing
for both of us.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.074
By the way,

33:55.950 --> 33:58.995
Ro has always wanted to go
to Tomorrowland, in Belgium.

33:59.495 --> 34:02.874
So I decided to use
the airfare and your permission

34:02.957 --> 34:05.293
to take him on a trip for his birthday.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.219
Hello.

34:15.970 --> 34:17.388
Are you serious?

34:18.014 --> 34:18.848
Where's Ana?

34:19.807 --> 34:23.394
Ana had a personal emergency,
but I'm doing the presentation.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.479
Forget it.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.191
When Ana is back, have her call me.

34:28.816 --> 34:31.903
What's your problem with me?
You keep undermining me.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.237
I'm not undermining you.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.158
I'm used to dealing with women
who are on the same level as me.

34:37.241 --> 34:41.454
That suit and those heels
don't impress me.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.248
-Excuse me.
-You know what?

34:46.375 --> 34:47.460
You're right.

34:48.961 --> 34:49.796
This costume

34:51.172 --> 34:52.131
doesn't suit me.

34:52.632 --> 34:57.470
Especially if this is a contest
about who wears the "highest heels"

34:57.970 --> 35:00.973
because I'm not into competing
with other women.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.768
It's a little too reminiscent
of the patriarchy.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.729
You're supposed to be a feminist.

35:06.813 --> 35:10.024
Look, kid,
while you were playing with dolls,

35:10.108 --> 35:11.609
I was fighting against men

35:11.692 --> 35:14.403
who looked down on me
just because I'm a woman.

35:14.487 --> 35:17.156
Thanks to women like Ana and me,

35:17.240 --> 35:22.328
girls from your generation
can get jobs worthy of their skill set.

35:22.411 --> 35:24.789
Marcela, I know that.

35:24.872 --> 35:28.709
I admire what you and Ana did
in the corporate world

35:28.793 --> 35:30.837
by opening the doors to the rest of us.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.966
But don't you think that's why
it's time to do things differently,

35:35.758 --> 35:42.014
to lead with more horizontality
between women, to be a sorority?

35:42.098 --> 35:44.809
We should build spaces where women

35:44.892 --> 35:46.894
don't have to measure their heels

35:46.978 --> 35:49.188
the way men do with their you-know-whats.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.274
When women stand together,

35:51.357 --> 35:52.525
we're much stronger.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.777
We can do amazing things.

35:56.195 --> 35:57.029
You know what?

36:01.659 --> 36:03.536
I'm sick of these heels.

36:03.619 --> 36:06.539
I'm sick of them giving me bunions.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.749
If you don't mind,

36:08.833 --> 36:11.878
I'll put my feet up
while you do your presentation.

36:11.961 --> 36:12.795
Go ahead.

36:14.380 --> 36:17.508
Well, this is Konene.

36:17.592 --> 36:21.762
Marcela approved everything,
even the gift baskets.

36:21.846 --> 36:25.808
She called me to say she was
very impressed with your presentation.

36:26.726 --> 36:29.353
She also said
she's never wearing heels again.

36:29.896 --> 36:33.399
-What did you say to her?
-We discussed horizontality.

36:36.402 --> 36:37.236
Here.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.073
-What's this?
-My share of the stock.

36:42.491 --> 36:45.036
You're more than ready
to steer the ship alone.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.287
Of course not.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.539
You and I are stronger together.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.167
We need to find a way.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.086
Laura says there's nothing we can do.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.717
Although, she did mention--

36:59.800 --> 37:00.635
What?

37:02.803 --> 37:05.264
Nothing important.
She did mention something else.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.266
It's too crazy.

37:07.975 --> 37:10.394
Ana, it would be crazier
to go our separate ways.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.320
Well, I have a plan.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.031
I'll tell you about it,

37:23.366 --> 37:24.951
but you can't tell anyone.

37:28.537 --> 37:30.331
<i>Hi, I'm Ximena Sariñana</i>,

37:30.414 --> 37:35.294
<i>and I wanna tell you</i>
<i>about an app that changed my experience</i>

37:35.378 --> 37:36.504
<i>of being a mom.</i>

37:36.587 --> 37:38.256
<i>It's made by women.</i>

37:38.339 --> 37:40.424
<i>By moms for moms.</i>

37:40.508 --> 37:43.094
<i>It's an amazing app that has everything.</i>

37:43.177 --> 37:46.264
<i>My congratulations to the creators,</i>
<i>Ana and Mariana.</i>

37:46.347 --> 37:48.307
<i>I wish you every success.</i>

37:48.391 --> 37:50.935
<i>Every mom needs this app.</i>

37:51.018 --> 37:53.396
<i>It has everything you need.</i>

37:53.479 --> 37:54.480
Hi, good morning.

37:54.563 --> 37:55.481
Hi.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.275
-Anuar.
-Yes.

37:57.358 --> 37:58.776
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

37:58.859 --> 37:59.860
Excuse me.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.030
Pablo.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.117
What are you doing here?

38:06.659 --> 38:07.827
Mariana invited me.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.581
I guess that means
you're patching things up.

38:13.207 --> 38:14.834
Oh, I don't know.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.336
I gave up trying to guess
what Mariana is up to.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.923
I think there's more
than misunderstandings between you two.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.259
We have a daughter.

38:23.759 --> 38:26.679
I know that, and I get it.

38:26.762 --> 38:30.224
But I don't think that's why
you're fighting with her so much.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.310
You need to figure out
how you feel about Mariana.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.563
Don't. Take your time.

38:37.148 --> 38:37.982
Ana.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.527
I'm glad to see you.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.279
I'm really proud of you.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.115
We can leave all this behind.

38:46.198 --> 38:47.450
Stop right there.

38:47.533 --> 38:50.244
I have something to tell you.
That's why I invited you.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.872
We'll talk after, okay?

38:55.791 --> 38:56.917
What's with that face?

38:57.001 --> 38:58.294
I went to the doctor.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.921
What's going on with me
isn't premenopause.

39:02.548 --> 39:03.716
It's this, look.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.385
What you and Ana have achieved

39:07.136 --> 39:08.220
is really something.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.264
I'm so proud of you.

39:18.230 --> 39:21.567
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah, I'm just a little nervous.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.444
Don't worry. You've got this.

39:23.527 --> 39:26.489
Mariana, we need to talk.

39:27.782 --> 39:28.949
I'll leave you two alone.

39:29.784 --> 39:30.618
It's fine.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.332
I'm pregnant.

39:36.415 --> 39:38.292
-No.
-Yes.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.210
No!

39:39.293 --> 39:41.337
-A sip won't hurt.
-Tere, what now?

39:41.420 --> 39:42.380
I don't know.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.215
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

39:44.799 --> 39:45.925
Have you told Lore?

39:46.008 --> 39:47.134
Told her what?

39:47.218 --> 39:49.678
-About our trip.
-Oh, no! I'm sorry.

39:49.762 --> 39:52.473
I don't have a passport.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.600
<i>I'm sorry about all this.</i>

39:54.683 --> 39:57.353
Please understand.
You carried Regis inside you,

39:57.436 --> 40:00.731
while I feel I still need
to score points to be with her.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.817
You've never had to do that,

40:02.900 --> 40:04.026
and you know it.

40:05.027 --> 40:06.278
We'll talk later, okay?

40:07.780 --> 40:08.906
Honey.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.866
I need to talk to you.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.326
Now's not a good time.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.245
Why? Is everything okay?

40:14.328 --> 40:16.080
Yes, it's just a big day.

40:16.163 --> 40:19.166
-We'll talk when this is over, okay?
-All right.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.419
-You know I support you.
-Yes.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.045
-I love you.
-And I love you.

40:23.754 --> 40:24.588
Ana.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.431
The fact they invited us
must be a good thing.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.725
The best thing for everyone
is to patch things up.

40:37.726 --> 40:38.978
-You think?
-Of course.

40:39.061 --> 40:41.439
It's the only explanation
for us being here.

40:41.939 --> 40:42.773
Isn't it?

40:43.774 --> 40:46.360
-Yeah, it's gotta be.
-I know, right?

40:46.861 --> 40:50.614
Thank you all for being here
on such a special day.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.577
We're really excited.
This means a lot to us.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.704
We couldn't have chosen a better day.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.832
I think all this can get
a bit more exciting.

40:59.915 --> 41:02.543
Why don't we give our guests a gift basket

41:02.626 --> 41:05.754
containing samples
of all our baby products?

41:05.838 --> 41:06.672
Yeah!

41:08.215 --> 41:11.552
That's a wonderful idea,
and I'm not the best at gifts.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.429
That's not true, Ana.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.639
You've given me so many gifts,

41:15.723 --> 41:18.309
experience, wisdom,

41:18.851 --> 41:21.312
and maybe a headache or two.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.065
In all seriousness,

41:26.025 --> 41:27.318
I've learned a lot from you.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.069
So have I.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.489
What else can you expect
from a partner in adventure?

41:32.281 --> 41:35.451
In a life full of challenges,

41:35.534 --> 41:37.036
sacrifices,

41:37.953 --> 41:40.539
and struggles,
we need someone to grow with,

41:41.040 --> 41:43.751
someone who makes us strong.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.669
Together, we're invincible.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.798
To Konene. Cheers.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.008
Cheers!

41:54.970 --> 41:56.222
Are you ready?

42:05.064 --> 42:06.023
Yes, I'm ready.

42:06.690 --> 42:11.612
It's time for an announcement
we can't delay any longer.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.657
We can't keep this a secret anymore.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.618
Mariana and I

42:19.286 --> 42:21.038
are more than just partners.
