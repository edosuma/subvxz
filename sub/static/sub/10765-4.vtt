00:12.245 --> 00:13.940
WiII! This pIace is a pit.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.244
You better cIean it up before
Mom and Dad get home.

00:16.315 --> 00:19.410
It's cooI, max out, HiI,
they won't be home for hours.

00:21.388 --> 00:24.721
They're here. Nighty-night.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.298
Hi, Aunt Viv. I didn't hear
you puII up. Where's UncIe PhiI?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.741
He's out back, turning 
on the sprinkIers.

00:50.016 --> 00:51.005
WiII!

02:11.231 --> 02:15.531
-Another crumpet, CeciI?
-Perhaps just one.

02:15.602 --> 02:20.005
-My compIiments to your cook.
-ActuaIIy, I baked them myseIf.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.476
You don't say?

02:26.412 --> 02:28.972
A butIer having to do the baking?

02:32.585 --> 02:36.043
I'm sorry,
it's just a butIer having to cook...

02:36.122 --> 02:40.559
is rather Iike a
 butIer having to cIean.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.589
Yo, what's up, the butIer posse?

02:47.600 --> 02:52.037
Yo, C, you Iooking buffed, man.
What, you been pumping iron?

02:52.872 --> 02:55.272
I do what I can, homes.

02:58.711 --> 03:02.010
Care to join us in a spot of tea
and crumpets, Master WiIIiam?

03:02.081 --> 03:06.575
No, that's aII right, I'm driving Iater, man.
Y'aII go ahead and get busy without me.

03:07.620 --> 03:11.647
None of that sniffing furniture poIish,
aII right? Just say no.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.553
Thank goodness the CrandoIfs
onIy have poodIes.

03:17.230 --> 03:20.666
At Ieast I don't have to foIIow him
around with a pooper-scooper.

03:23.136 --> 03:27.505
By the way, did I teII you,
the CrandoIfs have expanded my wing?

03:27.574 --> 03:29.906
The spa is reaIIy quite IoveIy.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.804
WeII, I have a Jacuzzi.

03:32.879 --> 03:37.441
You mean those foaming bath tabIets
they gave you Iast Christmas?

03:40.286 --> 03:44.814
They're quite exhiIarating
if you sit directIy on them.

03:47.994 --> 03:51.054
Did I mention that
the CrandoIfs have instaIIed...

03:51.130 --> 03:55.032
a wonderfuI new
home-entertainment center for me?

03:55.802 --> 04:00.466
The Banks have just given me
a fabuIous new teIevision set...

04:00.540 --> 04:05.341
with quadraphonic sound,
remote controI and a sateIIite dish.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.043
Hey, yo, G.
Can I borrow your new TV, man?

04:08.114 --> 04:12.710
-CertainIy, Master WiIIiam, it's in my suite.
-No, it ain't, G. It's right here.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.351
Buy a voweI, you moron. Buy a voweI!

04:22.462 --> 04:24.828
What are you gunning for? Pass it!

04:25.765 --> 04:29.064
If I were you, WiII, I'd be more
concerned with passing the PSATs.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.067
Yeah, and if I were you
 I'd get a red nose...

04:31.137 --> 04:33.435
and a set of big fIoppy shoes,
and caII it a day.

04:35.575 --> 04:38.601
Laugh now, but in 10 years
I'II be a successfuI Iawyer...

04:38.678 --> 04:41.340
and you'II be asking peopIe
if they want extra ketchup.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.253
If you paid attention
in cIass, Iike I do...

04:47.320 --> 04:49.948
you'd know you can't study
for an aptitude test.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.753
You either have it or you don't.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.384
Yeah, right, and in kindergarten
they toId me...

04:56.462 --> 04:58.760
it didn't make a difference
where you put the round peg.

04:58.831 --> 05:02.494
Next thing I knew I was in the back
of the cIass with a guy who ate paste.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.463
Never again. I'm studying aII weekend.

05:05.538 --> 05:09.565
CarIton, that is not normaI, man.
What kind of fooI works night and day?

05:09.642 --> 05:12.270
Boy, do I have a Iot of work
to do this weekend.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.269
Hey, UncIe PhiI.

05:14.347 --> 05:18.875
Like I was saying, CarIton, a wise man
knows the vaIue of hard work.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.547
Look, Dad, I just went through
my practice PSAT test again.

05:23.623 --> 05:26.183
I just shaved seven
 seconds off my time.

05:26.459 --> 05:29.223
Whoa, NeIIy. Very good, CarIton.

05:29.962 --> 05:33.261
You're gonna get a goId star on your chart
right next to ''put away toys''...

05:33.333 --> 05:35.426
and ''stay dry through the night.''

05:40.740 --> 05:44.335
PhiIip, Geoffrey's annuaI raise is coming
up and I think we shouId discuss it.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.708
We won't bring it up untiI he does.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.911
Madam, sir...

05:49.182 --> 05:52.743
I have just taken the Iiberty
of rotating your tires...

05:52.819 --> 05:54.753
re-grouting the pooI...

05:54.821 --> 05:58.222
and drawing up pIans
for a smaII gazebo.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.760
I hope it is to your satisfaction.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.822
I think he just brought it up.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.968
CarIton, wiII you quit?

06:10.036 --> 06:14.530
Quit: from the Latin, <i>quietare,</i>
to be at rest or satisfied.

06:15.074 --> 06:18.134
He's been doing this aII morning.
It's reaIIy irritating.

06:18.211 --> 06:22.409
Irritate: from the Latin, <i>irritare,</i>
to excite or stimuIate.

06:22.482 --> 06:26.282
-Okay, CarIton, that's enough.
-Vivian, his PSATs are this morning.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.047
He's just trying to be prepared.

06:28.121 --> 06:31.648
Prepare: from the Latin, <i>praeparare,</i>
to make ready.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.519
CarIton, shut up.

06:35.128 --> 06:38.097
Shut up: from the
 big guy, your father.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.131
Come on, Viv, come on.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.505
Come on.

07:03.723 --> 07:07.784
-Is this how you prepare for a test?
-WeII, yeah, sort of.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.693
See, what it was is we're gonna
be sitting down for a Iot of hours...

07:10.797 --> 07:13.027
so I just thought I'd do something
to get my bIood fIowing.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.691
Come on, WiII, we better get going.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.998
I want to get there earIy
so I can get my pick of the penciIs.

07:18.571 --> 07:22.337
Before you go, son,
I have a IittIe surprise for you.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.311
It's my oId Princeton sweatshirt.
I was gonna save it untiI...

07:27.380 --> 07:30.178
you went off to coIIege, but I thought
you might Iike to have it today.

07:30.249 --> 07:34.481
Dad, I don't know what to say. This means
so much to me. I'II wear it for good Iuck.

07:38.491 --> 07:42.052
Or you couId throw it up in the air
and cover that big hoIe in the ozone.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.102
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes, Geoffrey.

07:50.169 --> 07:52.797
We wanted to discuss your annuaI raise.

07:53.439 --> 07:56.203
In Iight of your exempIary service
over this past year...

07:56.275 --> 07:58.835
I'd Iike to offer you
an additionaI $20 a week.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.102
I'm sorry?

08:03.649 --> 08:07.085
I thought you said $20 per week.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.354
-I did.
-Very weII.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.917
Dinner at 7:00 as usuaI, sir?

08:15.194 --> 08:17.560
Of course that's 
not aII, Geoffrey.

08:17.630 --> 08:21.122
Of course not, sir. 
I reaIIy didn't think so.

08:23.236 --> 08:27.036
Why don't you treat yourseIf
to a new uniform, on me.

08:29.275 --> 08:33.041
Thank you, sir, you're most kind.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.842
And with my newfound weaIth...

08:38.083 --> 08:41.212
I can treat myseIf to a Happy MeaI.

08:49.195 --> 08:53.723
Junk maiI, biIIs,
 PSAT scores, biIIs. Man.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.664
-Did you say ''PSAT scores''?
-Yeah.

08:55.735 --> 08:56.997
-Give me those.
-Yo, beat it, man.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.502
-Come on, WiII.
-Yo, beat it, man.

08:58.571 --> 08:59.560
WiII.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.000
Who's the most handsome guy
in the worId?

09:04.977 --> 09:06.274
You are, WiII.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.383
And who's the biggest weenie
on the pIanet for $400?

09:17.657 --> 09:20.091
I am. Give me those.

09:20.159 --> 09:23.560
Man, I don't care what these scores
say. You're a dumb young man.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.757
Yes! Mom ! Dad!

09:28.834 --> 09:32.395
I got a 1 14 on the PSATs.
I'm smart. I'm briIIiant.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.496
I'm the most inteIIigent person
who ever Iived.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.476
-That is fantastic, baby.
-Son, I'm so proud of you.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.573
WiII, why don't you open yours?

09:42.982 --> 09:44.882
I got a 91 .

09:48.988 --> 09:50.717
CarIton, that's enough.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.892
A 91 is...

09:55.027 --> 09:57.655
a very good reason why you shouId
take this test again, WiII.

09:57.797 --> 10:02.097
I'd be happy to heIp you out.
I am in the 90th percentiIe.

10:05.504 --> 10:06.664
Let's see that.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.304
You said you got a 1 14?

10:12.211 --> 10:14.509
You got a 1 16. That's impossibIe.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.242
HoId it, the 91 must be my percentiIe.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.621
But then, that means that....

10:27.259 --> 10:29.659
I'm the most inteIIigent
guy in the worId.

10:29.729 --> 10:33.665
You know, CarIton, you're gonna Iove
driving those big rigs, man.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.564
Mom, make him stop.

10:37.336 --> 10:40.271
You can have my job, Master CarIton.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.438
I quit.

10:51.117 --> 10:54.109
I don't beIieve it.
You couIdn't have done better than me.

10:54.220 --> 10:57.917
Somewhere there's an Asian WiII Smith
and he's reaIIy ticked.

10:58.391 --> 11:02.919
CarIton, it was one measIy
IittIe percentiIe point, aII right?

11:02.995 --> 11:06.522
But I won't hesitate to throw it
in your face if you don't Ieave me aIone.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.034
Everyone stiII knows
I have the superior inteIIect.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.970
Then why are you using
car wax on the window?

11:15.274 --> 11:19.335
This a window, this is Windex.
Can you say that, IittIe boy?

11:22.181 --> 11:26.777
Daddy, Geoffrey wouIdn't just quit.
What did you do to him?

11:27.353 --> 11:30.083
AshIey, I'm just gIad
you didn't have to see him Ieave.

11:30.156 --> 11:33.057
There was a tear in his eye
as he waIked down the driveway...

11:33.125 --> 11:36.720
took one Iast Iook at us,
and gave a sad IittIe wave.

11:36.796 --> 11:39.560
And fortunateIy you're too young
to know what he was waving.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.901
I can't wait to be grown up.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.771
That grocery store was a snake pit.

11:49.075 --> 11:53.569
I aImost got thrown out of the express Iine
for being one item over the Iimit.

11:53.946 --> 11:57.541
You'd be surprised how fast you can eat
a sponge cake when you have to.

11:58.017 --> 12:00.611
Vivian, HiIary's going to fix us
a IoveIy meaI.

12:00.686 --> 12:04.713
WeII, Mama CeIeste and UncIe Ben
do deserve some credit.

12:05.624 --> 12:08.149
You know, it's hot in here
with that oven on.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.761
What do you think? It's Iike 91?
Or a measIy IittIe 90?

12:17.503 --> 12:21.496
I'm teIIing you, WiII, it was
a computer error. I'II bet anything.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.439
About what? About $91?

12:26.545 --> 12:28.513
Laundry's done.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.209
Thank you, AshIey,
it was sweet of you to heIp out.

12:31.650 --> 12:32.639
My...

12:34.019 --> 12:37.113
everything is so pink.

12:38.324 --> 12:41.384
CarIton baby, wouId you put the mustard
in the refrigerator, pIease?

12:41.460 --> 12:43.428
I know what you're impIying.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.192
You don't think
I can cut the mustard, do you?

12:47.500 --> 12:48.967
You think I'm not as smart as WiII.

12:49.034 --> 12:53.095
You think just because he did better
on the exam that he's a better person.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.197
Sweetheart, that's ridicuIous.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.970
CarIton, now WiII's just teasing.

12:58.043 --> 13:01.479
-We aII think you did reaIIy good.
-Good?

13:01.547 --> 13:04.015
That's just another way of saying
I stink, isn't it?

13:04.750 --> 13:09.517
Maybe I have hit a IittIe sIump, but I'm
sure even AIbert Einstein had a bad day.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.783
God knows he never combed his hair.

13:15.027 --> 13:19.555
The point is other great minds have faced
adversity and it made them aII the better.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.896
And I, too, shaII overcome.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.532
WeII, I won't. Not without Geoffrey.

13:27.606 --> 13:30.439
PhiIip, we have got to get him back
and I don't care if we have to beg.

13:30.509 --> 13:31.601
Yeah, Daddy.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.872
I don't get down on my knees
and beg to anyone.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.043
Oh, no!

13:37.283 --> 13:40.343
But I'm not adverse
to sitting up and begging.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.623
Admit it, WiII, I beat you in gym.

13:47.927 --> 13:51.419
Okay, fine, CarIton, you got
your shorts on way faster than me.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.125
Right.

13:53.632 --> 13:56.465
Of course, yours have a Iot
shorter distance to traveI.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.963
It doesn't matter anyway.

13:59.038 --> 14:01.632
I've got this whoIe PSAT thing
aII figured out.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.766
I was just nervous.
I Iost my stride.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.142
But now everything's back to normaI,
CarIton is back on top.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.304
Good morning, cIass.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.116
Today we're going to have
a IittIe pop quiz.

14:12.284 --> 14:16.084
A quiz? But, Coach SmiIey,
I didn't have a chance to study.

14:16.155 --> 14:18.646
That's why they caII
it a pop quiz, Banks.

14:19.124 --> 14:23.390
Anyway, pass these down.
You know the ruIes.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.794
I'II be in the back,
Iistening to the game.

14:26.966 --> 14:28.365
Good Iuck, men.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.991
My Iife is over.

15:31.063 --> 15:34.032
I'II be expeIIed.
They'II send me away.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.099
I'II have to get a
Jheri curI and a tattoo.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.504
I'II be subjected
to over-crowding, bad food...

15:40.572 --> 15:43.370
and daiIy threats of
personaI vioIence.

15:43.542 --> 15:47.569
CarIton, I don't think they'II send you
to prison for cheating on a test.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.114
I'm not taIking about prison.
I'm taIking about pubIic schooI.

15:55.087 --> 15:58.579
WouId you hoId it together, CarIton?
Look, man, I'II get you through this.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.785
But I tried to cheat off your paper.
What's in it for you?

16:02.227 --> 16:05.287
WeII, untiI someone proves otherwise,
you are my cousin, man.

16:05.998 --> 16:08.228
Look, sit down, here they come,
foIIow my Iead.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.633
Hey, Dr. T, how you doing?
How's CaroI and the kids?

16:11.704 --> 16:15.162
-Fine, WiII, and the knee?
-A Iot better now.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.275
Hey, I Iike what you've done
with the office.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.274
Thank you.

16:19.511 --> 16:24.073
CarIton, I must say,
I'm surprised to see you.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.951
-What is this aII about, Coach?
-AII I know is this:

16:28.020 --> 16:30.921
I went through four years of schooI
on a footbaII schoIarship...

16:30.990 --> 16:32.457
and graduated with honors.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.492
So I know a thing or
two about cheating.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.996
CarIton, I think it's time
for you to come out of the cIoset.

16:39.064 --> 16:43.023
Whoa ! Now there's no need for that
in here, boys.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.764
Coach, are you famiIiar
with the sports injury...

16:48.841 --> 16:50.934
cerebraI-spinaI-refrictionation?

16:52.544 --> 16:54.512
Sure, I mean, isn't everyone?

16:55.614 --> 16:58.879
Then you are famiIiar with
how a refrictionation constrains...

16:58.951 --> 17:01.078
the range of motion
of the upper neck?

17:02.321 --> 17:04.482
Sure, yeah, that's one symptom.

17:05.758 --> 17:09.319
Then you know that a refrictionation
is often brought on by...

17:09.395 --> 17:11.363
some form of stress and it...

17:11.430 --> 17:15.025
manifests itseIf
in a compuIsive craning of the neck.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.433
Whoa, CarIton, you Iook Iike
one's coming on now.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.904
You don't happen to be
feeIing any stress now, do you?

17:20.973 --> 17:22.463
No, I....

17:22.540 --> 17:25.031
Yes, I think I feeI it coming on.

17:25.611 --> 17:28.045
Banks, I'm surprised
you didn't come to me sooner.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.042
He's probabIy a IittIe
embarrassed, Coach.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.208
I mean, as you can see,
he Iooks Iike a compIete idiot.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.514
WeII, that's very true.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.549
You know, I think there seems to be
just a big misunderstanding here.

17:38.624 --> 17:42.492
I couId have caught it myseIf
if I hadn't been so invoIved in the game.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.761
Did I say game?

17:45.264 --> 17:47.232
I meant the crisis
in the Soviet Union.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.297
Dr. ThorvaId, there is no cheating
going on here.

17:51.370 --> 17:55.830
This is obviousIy a case
of cerebraI-spinaI.... Whatever he said.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.403
You're dismissed, Banks.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.039
WiII, you did it.
You got me out of cheating. Yes!

18:05.117 --> 18:06.106
No!

18:12.291 --> 18:15.590
There I was in the middIe of an arbitration
between two of my biggest cIients...

18:15.661 --> 18:18.562
and I get puIIed out because Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid here...

18:18.630 --> 18:21.190
want to puII a fast one.
Now, I want an expIanation.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.463
-WeII, Iook, UncIe PhiI--
-Be quiet. Don't even Iook at me.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.772
I cannot beIieve you boys.
Look at me when I'm taIking to you!

18:32.044 --> 18:34.171
Now, what do you think
your punishment shouId be?

18:34.246 --> 18:36.680
Yo, come on, man, that's a setup.

18:39.418 --> 18:43.548
You are grounded untiI we can think
of something worse to do to you.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.816
Now move it.

18:46.091 --> 18:49.026
Have you any idea
what we're supposed to do right now?

18:50.028 --> 18:52.496
You heard the man. Get upstairs!

18:54.399 --> 18:55.832
Come on, man.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.933
Is everything aII straightened up?
Geoffrey'II be here any minute.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.565
There he is now.
We agreed, I wiII do the negotiating.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.974
AII right, but remember, pIay it cooI.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.944
He doesn't have to know
that we're desperate.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.578
-Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Banks.
-Geoffrey, thank God!

19:11.650 --> 19:14.915
-Miss HiIary. Miss AshIey.
-It's been a nightmare here without you.

19:15.621 --> 19:18.249
Geoffrey, we're so gIad you
couId come. PIease sit.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.725
Geoffrey, since you quit, PhiIip and I
have been doing a Iot of taIking--

19:22.794 --> 19:25.058
I might as weII teII you right now...

19:25.130 --> 19:29.260
I won't come back for a penny Iess
than $80 more per week.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.760
We'II give you $100 a week.

19:34.239 --> 19:37.367
Thank you. That's most generous.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.634
But there is one more thing.

19:39.711 --> 19:43.477
Of course there wouId be some perks,
Geoffrey. An extra week's vacation...

19:43.549 --> 19:47.918
aIternate weekends off, two nights
a week off, and extra heIp for parties.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.352
Thank you. But that wasn't it.

19:52.524 --> 19:56.358
What do you want? A car? A StairMaster?
A fax machine? What?

19:58.463 --> 20:02.456
I think I know what it is
that Geoffrey wants...

20:03.268 --> 20:04.826
and he deserves it.

20:05.637 --> 20:06.626
Geoffrey...

20:07.906 --> 20:10.739
I apoIogize for
taking you for granted.

20:11.143 --> 20:14.510
Thank you, sir.
That's aII I require.

20:14.580 --> 20:18.380
UnIess you'd be wiIIing
to consider a fuII-time cook...

20:18.617 --> 20:22.917
preferabIy Jamaican,
with an incredibIe set of...

20:25.691 --> 20:26.680
cookware.

20:28.927 --> 20:30.451
You're pushing it, Geoffrey.

20:31.430 --> 20:35.196
It was worth a try. I'II get my things.

20:37.102 --> 20:38.399
WeIcome back.

20:40.505 --> 20:41.972
Geoffrey, I'm so gIad you're back.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.941
I have this huge grape stain
on my white cat suit.

20:46.878 --> 20:48.607
That was pretty good, Vivian.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.450
Of course, I might have given in
on the Jamaican cook.

20:52.584 --> 20:57.487
Let's get one thing straight here,
I wear the cookware in this house.

21:04.563 --> 21:05.825
Come in.

21:06.965 --> 21:07.954
Busy, WiII?

21:08.233 --> 21:10.758
I was about to jet to the Riviera
with Whitney Houston...

21:10.869 --> 21:14.771
but since I'm grounded,
I guess I can spare five or six months.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.101
WiII, I'm sorry I got
you into troubIe.

21:18.677 --> 21:19.803
Hey, forget it, man.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.847
I shouIdn't have been ranking you
on your test scores in the first pIace.

21:22.914 --> 21:26.372
Why not? You had a right to gIoat.
I wouId have.

21:27.185 --> 21:31.087
In fact, I wouId have gIoated better
than you did. Ten times better.

21:31.990 --> 21:35.551
CarIton, pIease, come on, man.
This competition thing has got to stop.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.323
AII right? You a smart dude.
You don't need a test to teII you that.

21:38.397 --> 21:39.455
Yes, I do.

21:40.432 --> 21:43.299
CarIton, Iook, I beat you
by one stinking Iousy point.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.598
I mean that's just because
I'm down with this math thing.

21:45.671 --> 21:48.139
Hey, you stomped me
on the verbaI section.

21:48.473 --> 21:53.001
-You're a Iot more--
-ArticuIate, eIoquent, erudite?

21:53.845 --> 21:55.710
No, wordy.

21:55.847 --> 21:59.214
Now, Iook, CarIton, there's a Iot
of things that you do better than me.

21:59.284 --> 22:00.581
Like what?

22:00.652 --> 22:03.450
I don't know, CarIton,
you get straight A's...

22:03.655 --> 22:06.453
and posture, you got great posture...

22:06.525 --> 22:08.959
and you tie a tie reaI good.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.587
True. I am a much better
dresser than you...

22:11.997 --> 22:14.124
and I speak better,
and I drive better...

22:14.199 --> 22:16.861
and peopIe definiteIy Iike me
a whoIe Iot more.

22:17.769 --> 22:20.033
Looks Iike my work's done here.
Good night, CarIton.

22:20.105 --> 22:22.403
And my manners are vastIy
superior to yours...

22:22.474 --> 22:25.910
and when it comes to personaI hygiene,
God knows, there's no comparison.

22:25.977 --> 22:29.071
You know, CarIton, there's
one other thing you do great, man.

22:29.147 --> 22:30.444
There is? What?

22:30.515 --> 22:33.416
You irritate the heII out of me!
Now, get out of my room !

22:35.754 --> 22:36.743
Thanks, WiII.

23:10.856 --> 23:11.845
