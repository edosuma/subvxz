WEBVTT

00:00.475 --> 00:02.150
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.186 --> 00:03.810
There is a stable in Switzerland

00:03.844 --> 00:06.310
that runs a training camp
for up and coming jumpers.

00:06.346 --> 00:08.010
I would like to put
Georgie's name forward.

00:08.108 --> 00:09.776
I mean,
I know we're not exactly poor,

00:09.802 --> 00:11.040
we're not millionaires, either.

00:11.056 --> 00:12.357
This might be out of our reach, Lou.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.288
Peter, we have to at least explore it.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.133
I mean,
this could be a big deal for Georgie.

00:16.154 --> 00:17.936
So I think we can go down
to two milliliters of bute

00:17.957 --> 00:19.189
for the next five days.

00:19.242 --> 00:21.386
- Great, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.530
What about Shooting Star?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.730
Oh, she's doing well.

00:27.050 --> 00:29.114
The ligaments in her leg
are starting to heal,

00:29.130 --> 00:31.765
so she won't need any painkillers.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.704
They're beautiful.

00:37.810 --> 00:39.210
It's official now.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

01:18.960 --> 01:20.586
Thanks for taking me out here, Amy.

01:20.618 --> 01:22.280
Hey, no problem.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.722
I figured you could use a change.

01:23.738 --> 01:25.790
You've been training pretty hard.

01:25.935 --> 01:28.465
Yeah well, these next few
events could take me to Europe.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.909
And you're ready.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.909
You are!

01:31.925 --> 01:33.498
Come on, you need to relax a little.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.450
Start having some fun!

01:36.122 --> 01:38.928
Well, we should head back
if we wanna catch that race.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.221
Did you say "race"?

01:42.960 --> 01:44.250
Hey!

01:56.400 --> 01:58.421
Why do we have so many
channels on this thing?!

01:58.442 --> 02:00.020
So Lisa can't watch this race online?

02:00.050 --> 02:01.370
Well, apparently not.

02:01.392 --> 02:04.960
And Fairfield has a lot
riding on Shooting Star.

02:05.045 --> 02:07.264
Well, Star was out for a
while with a leg injury,

02:07.270 --> 02:09.413
and Laura was pretty impatient
to get her back on the circuit.

02:09.434 --> 02:12.837
Yeah, speaking of patience,
I'm about to lose mine.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.470
The channels on this thing.

02:14.501 --> 02:15.328
I have one of the best...

02:15.350 --> 02:16.954
Stop! Right there, that is it.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.570
- And they're off!
- Just in time, too.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.589
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:21.980 --> 02:22.917
Did we miss it?

02:22.944 --> 02:26.910
Come on, Star, you've gotta pick it up!

02:27.010 --> 02:29.061
Well,
we did tell Laura not to expect much

02:29.080 --> 02:29.520
from Star's first race back.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.608
<i>They're five across
the track, coming for home now!</i>
from Star's first race back.

02:30.608 --> 02:31.978
<i>They're five across
the track, coming for home now!</i>

02:32.000 --> 02:34.650
- Will you look at this!
- Whoa!

02:34.682 --> 02:37.130
- Ohh!
- Look at-look at her go!

02:37.141 --> 02:39.460
From all the way back there,
look at this!

02:39.482 --> 02:41.060
- Oh my gosh!
- Whoa!

02:41.088 --> 02:43.800
- Yes, come on... yes!
- Fantastic! She won!

02:43.813 --> 02:45.429
- Oh! That was incredible!
- I don't believe it!

02:45.450 --> 02:47.130
- Did you...
- Wait 'til I tell Lisa!

02:47.146 --> 02:48.362
- Oh my...
- This is...

02:48.389 --> 02:51.637
Maybe just,
just hold on a second, okay?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.162
GG! We're home!

02:53.184 --> 02:55.594
Oh my gosh, look at you!

02:55.616 --> 02:59.013
What a beautiful surprise!

02:59.056 --> 03:00.634
- What are you doing here?
- Yeah, I thought you weren't

03:00.640 --> 03:02.058
supposed to get home 'til tomorrow.

03:02.085 --> 03:05.216
Yeah well, since you guys are
already clearly celebrating,

03:05.226 --> 03:07.550
we'll throw in our good news as well.

03:07.728 --> 03:11.420
Katie and I just said goodbye
to New York for the last time.

03:11.488 --> 03:13.248
We're officially home... to stay.

03:13.248 --> 03:14.256
Oh my goodness!
We're officially home... to stay.

03:14.256 --> 03:14.336
Oh my goodness!

03:14.997 --> 03:16.634
Oh my gosh!

03:59.253 --> 04:01.136
- You're home for good?
- No more New York?

04:01.173 --> 04:04.874
Nope, just me and my girls, full time.

04:04.901 --> 04:07.317
I can't believe it.
How did this all happen?

04:07.349 --> 04:09.093
Well, Nicole offered to buy me out

04:09.109 --> 04:11.550
of the Maggie's franchise,
and I said yes.

04:11.642 --> 04:14.410
As of today, I am a silent partner.

04:15.018 --> 04:15.813
Wow.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.558
Oh, and there's one more thing.

04:18.688 --> 04:19.946
The Euro camp.

04:20.369 --> 04:23.169
It's doable, if you still wanna go.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.960
Are you serious?

04:25.140 --> 04:26.538
You and Dad can afford it?

04:26.650 --> 04:28.688
Yeah. We can.

04:29.010 --> 04:32.560
I don't believe it!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

04:41.220 --> 04:42.074
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:42.096 --> 04:44.709
I am so sorry,
I thought this thing was on silent.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.872
That's okay. Lyndy didn't wake up.

04:48.024 --> 04:49.484
Who's texting you so late?

04:49.530 --> 04:50.629
Laura.

04:51.152 --> 04:53.093
Apparently she just wanted to thank us

04:53.120 --> 04:55.616
for helping in Star's recovery.

04:55.653 --> 04:58.400
And she owes us
"a hundred million favours".

04:58.760 --> 05:00.298
Well, can one of them be not to text us

05:00.320 --> 05:01.562
in the middle of the night?

05:08.840 --> 05:10.096
I think we're good.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.568
It's Scott.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.653
He says, "congrats on the big win".

05:15.664 --> 05:17.728
I wish I could be excited about this

05:17.744 --> 05:19.296
like everyone else is.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.717
Yeah, I know what you mean.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.589
I mean, Star was healed, but...

05:24.010 --> 05:25.808
she was still weak.

05:26.037 --> 05:27.749
You know, for her to win like that?

05:28.395 --> 05:29.962
I don't know, it's just weird.

05:30.016 --> 05:32.106
Maybe we should go out
tomorrow and check on her.

05:32.122 --> 05:34.917
Just see how she's doing post-race.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.103
I like the sound of that.

05:39.210 --> 05:40.874
Have I told you how much I'm enjoying

05:40.890 --> 05:42.789
this working together thing?

05:42.930 --> 05:44.789
- I think you have.
- Oh, I have?

05:44.816 --> 05:46.341
But you can tell me again.

05:46.677 --> 05:48.490
I really enjoy this.

05:49.595 --> 05:51.395
- Yeah, but how much?
- Yeah...

05:59.260 --> 06:02.741
Mommy? Yeah. Yeah.

06:02.789 --> 06:04.930
- Mommy!
- Yeah.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.573
Okay, boy.

06:07.706 --> 06:09.082
We've got this.

06:10.192 --> 06:12.112
We're so close, okay?

06:14.634 --> 06:15.909
Okay, let's go.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.614
Come on, wake up!

06:21.720 --> 06:22.549
Get!

06:46.558 --> 06:48.588
Wow,
Georgie is doing great out there.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.632
Well, I'm sure your news about Europe

06:51.680 --> 06:54.314
is giving her some added motivation.

06:54.634 --> 06:56.362
You know,
I don't even wanna know how much

06:56.384 --> 06:58.220
it's gonna cost you and Peter.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.048
Well, it's a huge opportunity,

07:00.058 --> 07:01.701
and I didn't wanna hold her back.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.290
And... neither did Peter.

07:05.653 --> 07:08.389
- Oh, hey!
- There's my niece!

07:08.410 --> 07:09.360
There's Auntie Lou!

07:09.381 --> 07:12.624
Hi! Auntie Lou missed you so much! Hi!

07:12.634 --> 07:15.781
Well, that's perfect,
because I need you babysit.

07:15.792 --> 07:17.216
I've gotta run to Fairfield.

07:17.232 --> 07:19.328
I would love to,
but I have a work thing.

07:19.365 --> 07:21.546
Oh, I'll watch her. It's not a problem.

07:21.557 --> 07:22.277
Thank you, Grandpa.

07:22.298 --> 07:24.362
And here I thought my
sister might relax a little

07:24.378 --> 07:27.002
- now that she's home.
- I'm going to.

07:27.018 --> 07:29.189
- Do you wanna go play?
- Yeah.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.400
I plan on just hanging out with family,

07:34.410 --> 07:35.674
spending time at home,

07:35.696 --> 07:38.490
but first,
I'm gonna refocus the family businesses,

07:38.512 --> 07:40.117
starting with the Dude Ranch.

07:40.133 --> 07:42.368
It needs some serious revamping.

07:42.394 --> 07:44.130
There's the sister I know and love.

07:44.149 --> 07:46.405
Okay, see you guys later.
Thanks, Grandpa!

07:46.416 --> 07:47.456
Bye.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.933
Hey, what's with the boxes?

07:48.949 --> 07:51.045
Oh, Lisa shipped home some wine

07:51.072 --> 07:52.770
she's been collecting on her travels.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.357
Right, she's coming home this weekend.

07:54.373 --> 07:55.642
Yes, she is.

07:55.690 --> 07:57.994
You have anything special planned?

07:58.410 --> 08:01.552
Well, I thought we'd have
a nice welcome home dinner

08:01.562 --> 08:02.938
with the family.

08:03.829 --> 08:05.557
Why? What have you got in mind?

08:05.589 --> 08:06.645
I think your plans need

08:06.666 --> 08:08.432
a little revamping of their own.

08:09.770 --> 08:11.616
Lyndy, come have breakfast!

08:12.965 --> 08:15.400
Hmm, hey, girl.

08:15.630 --> 08:17.728
You did so well out there.

08:17.749 --> 08:19.600
We're so proud of you.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.928
Yeah.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.502
Let's see how you're doing here...

08:25.637 --> 08:27.290
Amy, come feel this.

08:29.110 --> 08:30.160
hey.

08:30.416 --> 08:31.680
It's really hot.

08:34.049 --> 08:36.308
I heard my dream team was here!

08:36.325 --> 08:38.005
I have a bottle of
champagne in my office

08:38.015 --> 08:40.821
- we need to pop, let's go!
- Actually, Laura...

08:41.260 --> 08:43.173
Ty's found something.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.309
It's a stress fracture.

08:46.421 --> 08:48.618
But her leg just healed.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.389
I know. And when I cleared Star,

08:50.405 --> 08:52.261
I said her leg was fine, but delicate.

08:52.272 --> 08:53.701
Well, she was ready, Ty.

08:53.712 --> 08:55.173
I mean, come on, she won.

08:55.216 --> 08:58.080
Well, she must've got the
injury after the race.

08:58.096 --> 08:59.510
Do you remember anything?

08:59.590 --> 09:01.381
I don't know, I mean, uh...

09:01.720 --> 09:03.850
a horse kicked at her when
she was getting trailered.

09:03.856 --> 09:06.085
But I really didn't think
it was that serious.

09:06.261 --> 09:07.813
I'll get some herbal
supplements together

09:07.829 --> 09:08.810
for her feed.

09:08.832 --> 09:11.930
That'll help ease the pain
when she's on stall rest.

09:12.610 --> 09:13.829
Stall rest?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.442
Two of the worst words in horse racing.

09:17.230 --> 09:18.389
How long this time?

09:18.458 --> 09:20.554
I won't know until I get a
better look at these x-rays.

09:20.618 --> 09:22.240
She's scheduled to race this weekend.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.989
I'm sorry, Laura.

09:31.980 --> 09:32.677
Mitch.

09:32.693 --> 09:34.610
- Hey!
- Hey.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.704
It was nice to get your call.

09:37.180 --> 09:40.613
So,
how long are you in town for this time?

09:40.629 --> 09:42.350
Well, actually...

09:42.450 --> 09:44.069
I'm here to stay.

09:44.260 --> 09:45.386
Really?

09:46.090 --> 09:48.026
- What, like permanently?
- Yeah.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.752
Wow, well, you finally did it.

09:51.964 --> 09:53.464
I think that's great, welcome home, Lou.

09:53.482 --> 09:54.314
Thanks.

09:54.630 --> 09:57.397
But uh, there is something else.

09:57.413 --> 09:59.136
Yes, there always is.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.789
Star would've raced this weekend,

10:10.800 --> 10:12.080
and probably broken her leg

10:12.101 --> 10:13.850
if we hadn't listened to our gut.

10:14.090 --> 10:17.088
Yeah well, my gut's telling
me something else right now.

10:17.620 --> 10:18.986
Laura's lying to us.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.146
- What?
- Yeah.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.530
I don't think Star got
kicked after the race.

10:25.010 --> 10:26.218
There was no abrasion.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.296
And the fracture was too advanced,

10:27.306 --> 10:28.784
I think this happened a few days ago.

10:28.805 --> 10:30.630
- You mean before the race?
- Yeah!

10:30.820 --> 10:33.781
But Star could never
have won on that injury.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.802
Unless...

10:35.969 --> 10:38.204
- you don't think...
- Well...

10:39.260 --> 10:41.050
Can you keep Laura
busy for a few minutes?

10:41.082 --> 10:42.944
- I wanna check something.
- Yeah, for sure.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.010
Okay.

10:47.340 --> 10:49.290
So a family sold all their stuff,

10:49.312 --> 10:51.045
and then crossed the
country like pioneers?

10:51.072 --> 10:53.072
In a covered wagon, no less.

10:53.114 --> 10:54.850
How is this article relevant?

10:54.880 --> 10:58.090
The Dude Ranch is going
to offer pioneer weekends.

10:58.128 --> 10:59.866
Guests will live like settlers.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.480
Cook by fire, sleep under the stars,

11:02.501 --> 11:04.430
with no modern-day distractions.

11:04.530 --> 11:08.106
It's the perfect getaway
for the disconnected family.

11:08.340 --> 11:10.346
Which is how I pitched it
to my client in New York.

11:10.357 --> 11:11.605
And she totally bit.

11:11.637 --> 11:14.154
So she's coming out next
week with her whole family.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.508
Theme vacations are huge right now.

11:16.544 --> 11:19.504
So she's expecting all
of this by next week?

11:19.578 --> 11:20.997
We can pull it off, right?

11:21.029 --> 11:24.469
I mean, kinda like what
you did for Maya's retreat.

11:25.669 --> 11:27.856
Well,
I-I didn't really didn't do that much.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.837
But Lou, you realize just
how crazy all of this sounds,

11:30.848 --> 11:31.866
- right?
- Come on, I'm sure I've said

11:31.877 --> 11:33.802
way crazier things than this to you.

11:33.850 --> 11:35.082
Ain't that the truth.

11:36.763 --> 11:40.332
Mitch, please. I'm in a bit of a bind.

11:43.730 --> 11:47.200
So people will pay to be pioneers?

11:47.221 --> 11:48.810
And spend the weekend living the simple,

11:48.832 --> 11:50.773
stress-free pioneer life.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.104
Now, I'm pretty sure the pioneers

11:53.114 --> 11:55.269
had their fair share of stresses.

11:55.296 --> 11:56.560
Yeah. Like surviving.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.730
You guys are missing the point.

11:58.746 --> 12:01.146
Besides,
Mitch and I found a great campsite,

12:01.162 --> 12:03.717
and I need to test out
this concept out asap.

12:03.744 --> 12:04.581
So...

12:04.709 --> 12:08.260
I invite you all to step back
in time with me tomorrow.

12:09.710 --> 12:11.274
Come on, you guys!

12:11.301 --> 12:13.072
This is one of the main
reasons I came home.

12:13.082 --> 12:15.274
To spend more time with family.

12:15.328 --> 12:16.656
Plus you're the only one who can drive

12:16.677 --> 12:18.602
the covered wagon Mitch found.

12:19.710 --> 12:21.856
Well, I'm in, I mean,
I think Lyndy would love it.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.690
- Okay.
- Excellent!

12:23.738 --> 12:25.120
- Grandpa?
- No!

12:25.141 --> 12:28.074
- No, I'm busy, Lou.
- Ugh!

12:28.149 --> 12:29.701
And my event's the next day, so.

12:29.776 --> 12:32.380
You know,
a night off might help get you focused.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.048
She's not wrong, Georgie.

12:34.314 --> 12:37.546
And besides,
don't make us do this alone.

12:37.568 --> 12:39.914
- Come.
- Okay. Fine.

12:39.930 --> 12:42.848
Yes! Amazing!
You guys are not going to regret this.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.234
I'm excited.

12:44.540 --> 12:45.856
Yay!

12:48.050 --> 12:49.962
So you spent the whole day with Mitch?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.424
Jeez, you don't waste any time.

12:51.450 --> 12:53.637
We're friends. It's nothing.

12:53.712 --> 12:54.682
Mhmm.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.168
There was one thing, though.

12:57.580 --> 13:00.346
Last time I was here, Mitch told Grandpa

13:00.357 --> 13:02.416
that he and Maya were getting serious.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.389
But today whenever I mentioned Maya,

13:04.416 --> 13:07.584
Mitch just changed the subject.
Deflected.

13:07.818 --> 13:09.621
It just made me wonder if maybe

13:09.642 --> 13:11.360
she's not in the picture anymore.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.370
Do you really wanna go there?

13:14.650 --> 13:17.018
No, you're right. It doesn't matter.

13:17.045 --> 13:19.130
What matters is I'm home,

13:19.242 --> 13:22.100
and the franchise is sold,
and Georgie can go to Europe.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.168
Wait, is that why you sold
your shares in Maggie's?

13:25.216 --> 13:26.458
For Georgie?

13:27.010 --> 13:29.877
Well, Peter and I finally did the math,

13:29.909 --> 13:32.090
and it was a lot of money.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.498
But it's Georgie's dream,
so it will all be worth it.

13:35.578 --> 13:37.696
Wasn't the franchise your dream?

13:38.385 --> 13:40.386
Yes, it was.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.390
But I've been wanting to come
home for a while now, Amy.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.218
This opportunity for
Georgie just gave me

13:46.229 --> 13:48.618
the extra push I needed. You know?

13:48.860 --> 13:51.093
The truth is,
Nicole made me that offer months ago.

13:51.109 --> 13:54.720
And I was going to say yes,
and then Maya happened,

13:54.736 --> 13:57.536
and I just ran away.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.437
But I'm not making any more
decisions based on a guy.

14:00.501 --> 14:04.160
Even if that said guy
might be single now?

14:04.590 --> 14:07.322
I'm home. And for the right reasons.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.482
I'll just... leave the rest up to fate.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.661
What?

14:24.297 --> 14:26.698
Ah, she's alive, good.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.856
Because I was uh,
texting you and calling you all day.

14:29.866 --> 14:32.040
And then you didn't respond,
and I thought maybe...

14:32.170 --> 14:34.021
Sorry. I've been busy.

14:35.146 --> 14:37.765
So my Mom, she's home for good now.

14:37.802 --> 14:39.110
She sold her business.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.845
Wow, that's big news.

14:41.898 --> 14:44.320
Yeah, so they can...

14:44.426 --> 14:46.826
they can afford the Euro camp now.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.290
- If I qualify.
- You're gonna qualify.

14:49.370 --> 14:51.018
For sure, trust me.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.045
And that's awesome that
they can afford it,

14:53.056 --> 14:55.430
I'm super happy for you.
Oh, actually uh,

14:55.461 --> 14:56.860
- this is perfect!
- What is?

14:56.880 --> 14:58.592
Well, Olivia dumped Adam today.

14:58.634 --> 15:01.834
- And that's perfect?!
- Yes, well, not for Adam.

15:01.850 --> 15:04.122
It sucks for Adam,
he's super messed up about it.

15:04.149 --> 15:06.256
But my favourite band's
playing in Calgary tomorrow,

15:06.272 --> 15:08.586
and so I bought me and Adam
tickets just to cheer him up.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.245
And you should totally come with us.

15:10.314 --> 15:12.373
- Because they start super early.
- Oh...

15:12.790 --> 15:14.645
Wyatt, I'd love to, but I...

15:14.693 --> 15:16.757
But you've got your event the next day.

15:16.789 --> 15:18.608
No. Well, yeah, that too.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.890
But my mom's planned this camping trip,
so...

15:20.917 --> 15:23.125
So your boyfriend's out of luck.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.880
I'm under a lot of pressure, okay?

15:26.901 --> 15:29.840
Well, I mean, it's like,
it's a camping trip,

15:29.893 --> 15:32.469
and a European tour,
so it's not that bad.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.381
What if I don't qualify?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.034
My mom's given up everything for me.

15:35.050 --> 15:36.698
What do you mean?

15:38.080 --> 15:39.338
I'm sorry, I...

15:40.320 --> 15:42.058
you don't get it. Um...

15:42.500 --> 15:44.496
have fun at your-your concert.

15:44.533 --> 15:45.685
Thanks.

15:47.632 --> 15:49.032
Okay, uh...

15:49.232 --> 15:51.354
well... see 'ya.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.008
See 'ya.

15:55.952 --> 15:57.050
Good boy.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.290
Uh, okay.

16:02.150 --> 16:04.448
Yeah, no,
thanks for the rush job on the tests.

16:04.950 --> 16:06.613
All right, bye.

16:08.060 --> 16:08.736
That was Scott.

16:08.746 --> 16:10.704
He just got the test results
back from the blood sample

16:10.709 --> 16:12.549
- I took from Star today.
- And?

16:13.354 --> 16:15.510
Her blood is full of painkillers.

16:15.610 --> 16:18.448
She ran the race on that fracture,
just like we thought.

16:19.370 --> 16:20.800
She was doped.

16:30.576 --> 16:32.005
Do you understand?
- Laura?

16:32.630 --> 16:33.840
- Hey, can we talk?
- Be right back.

16:33.872 --> 16:36.080
- Yep.
- Yeah? How can I help you?

16:36.186 --> 16:37.856
Did you pump Star full of painkillers

16:37.866 --> 16:41.296
- so she could run that race?
- What? No!

16:41.322 --> 16:43.002
Star has a stress fracture.

16:43.072 --> 16:45.722
But she didn't even flinch
when we felt her leg yesterday.

16:46.096 --> 16:47.589
'Cause she was on bute, right?

16:47.605 --> 16:49.157
Winners are always tested after a race,

16:49.173 --> 16:50.656
so how was it not detected?

16:50.700 --> 16:52.954
Honestly, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:52.992 --> 16:56.208
We ran bloodwork, Laura. We know.

16:58.053 --> 16:59.642
When did that fracture happen?

17:01.066 --> 17:03.580
It was during training before the race.

17:03.621 --> 17:05.546
And after I'd cleared her.
Why didn't you call me?!

17:05.557 --> 17:08.619
- There wasn't time, Ty.
- How could you do that?

17:08.832 --> 17:11.957
- When Lisa finds out...
- Oh. Lisa can't know.

17:12.021 --> 17:14.133
Well, Fairfield's our client,
and Lisa's our family,

17:14.137 --> 17:15.285
so we're telling her.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.041
You know,
you two really need to grow up.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.252
This is how the racing world works.

17:21.455 --> 17:23.568
No one talks about it,
but everyone does it.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.417
Okay, but that doesn't make it right.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.031
Right or wrong,
none of us want this getting out.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.914
Although if people
started asking questions,

17:31.925 --> 17:33.552
I-I guess I'd have to tell them

17:33.568 --> 17:36.197
where I got all those
drugs I used on Star.

17:36.660 --> 17:38.965
Those drugs were for other horses,
not Star,

17:38.976 --> 17:39.845
and you knew that!

17:39.866 --> 17:41.493
It's your word against mine, isn't it?

17:41.990 --> 17:43.685
You go to Lisa, I go to the press.

17:43.717 --> 17:46.058
- What?
- If any of this goes public,

17:46.074 --> 17:48.613
you're not only destroying
everything Lisa's built,

17:48.650 --> 17:50.714
you're gonna ruin your
own careers as well.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.997
We're all involved in this now.

17:58.970 --> 18:00.197
Let's go.

18:02.970 --> 18:05.429
Hello? Anybody home?

18:09.270 --> 18:09.936
hey, Jack.

18:09.962 --> 18:11.710
I didn't see you there. Sorry.

18:11.733 --> 18:14.565
- Hello, Peter.
- Hey! What are you doing here?

18:14.608 --> 18:16.850
Oh, uh, I came to surprise Georgie.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.442
- For her big event tomorrow.
- Oh, right.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.990
Oh, she'll appreciate that,

18:20.010 --> 18:21.594
she's been training extra hard

18:21.610 --> 18:23.397
on account of your big gesture.

18:23.429 --> 18:26.453
Georgie's not here right now.
She's uh, on a run.

18:26.490 --> 18:28.202
Oh uh, what about Katie?

18:28.208 --> 18:30.746
She's at a sleepover.
Hey, um, could we chat later?

18:30.757 --> 18:33.562
I just, I have to run and see
a guy about a covered wagon.

18:33.578 --> 18:34.554
Sure.

18:35.258 --> 18:36.666
Was that a butter churn?

18:36.688 --> 18:38.410
Yeah, well, you know, it's...

18:38.416 --> 18:40.340
it's best not to ask.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.840
Aha, a wine fridge, huh?

18:43.850 --> 18:46.080
Nice! Giving the place a little upgrade?

18:46.096 --> 18:49.258
It's a little welcome
home gift for Lisa.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.590
Oh, okay.

18:50.677 --> 18:52.090
Oh yeah, no, I know all about these.

18:52.122 --> 18:54.120
I've got the same model in my condo,
actually.

18:54.144 --> 18:55.660
Well, I'm on a deadline.

18:55.674 --> 18:57.717
I could use an extra pair of hands.

18:57.744 --> 18:59.360
Yeah, sure, I'd love to help.

18:59.386 --> 19:00.634
Good!

19:02.910 --> 19:05.061
Well, the good news is,
Star is on stall rest.

19:05.072 --> 19:07.242
So we can deal with Laura later.

19:07.621 --> 19:10.210
What can we do, Amy? Laura's right.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.973
If people find out Star's doped,

19:12.005 --> 19:13.872
they're gonna ask where the
drugs came from. I'm involved.

19:13.882 --> 19:15.178
It's not your fault, though.

19:15.205 --> 19:16.602
I should've monitored things better.

19:16.618 --> 19:18.181
I should've checked on Laura more!

19:18.192 --> 19:19.765
- That is not your job!
- It's just...

19:19.797 --> 19:21.557
Okay, you prescribe medication.

19:21.573 --> 19:23.482
You can't be there every
time it's given out!

19:23.498 --> 19:25.312
No vet can. There has to be some trust.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.957
Yeah well, trust is gonna
be hard after this one, Amy.

19:27.984 --> 19:29.589
- Ty...
- We work together now, okay?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.810
So when I make a mistake...

19:30.826 --> 19:31.930
Yeah, but you didn't make a mistake!

19:31.952 --> 19:35.030
- You did everything right!
- Look! I know! Okay?!

19:35.130 --> 19:36.826
And I still got burned!

19:37.500 --> 19:39.109
Laura could ruin me.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.816
And now we're partners,

19:40.832 --> 19:43.045
so your name's gonna get
dragged through the mud, too.

19:43.673 --> 19:45.274
This is all my fault.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.845
I don't think us working
together is such a good idea.

19:48.820 --> 19:52.256
- Why would you say that?
- I don't know.

19:52.272 --> 19:55.162
I just... I need some time
to figure this out, okay?

19:55.173 --> 19:56.634
Can we keep this between
us while I clear my head?

19:56.645 --> 19:57.349
I'll talk to Lou,

19:57.370 --> 19:59.408
we don't have to go on that
camping trip, please just stay,

19:59.429 --> 20:02.290
- and talk this through with me!
- I need some time, okay?!

20:10.730 --> 20:11.861
Where do you need me?

20:11.893 --> 20:14.394
Well, I was wiring that wall plug, so.

20:15.253 --> 20:17.840
All right. Let's see here.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.712
- Oh, Peter, wait, no!
- Ooooh!

20:24.410 --> 20:26.149
That's still on, I think.

20:26.986 --> 20:29.765
Hey, Dad! What're you doing here?

20:29.856 --> 20:31.550
Are you kidding me? I came to see you!

20:31.637 --> 20:34.592
Come here!
I wouldn't miss your big event.

20:34.752 --> 20:35.749
Well, you didn't have to do that,

20:35.765 --> 20:37.349
you've done so much already.

20:37.761 --> 20:39.361
Does this mean you can
come on that camping trip?

20:39.376 --> 20:40.714
Mom talked us all into it.

20:40.746 --> 20:43.002
Uh... yeah, yeah, of course.

20:43.029 --> 20:44.698
I-I may have to meet you there, though,

20:44.773 --> 20:46.048
I'm helping Jack out with something,
so...

20:46.074 --> 20:47.994
Oh no, I'm good.

20:49.490 --> 20:51.498
Oh, okay, well,
I've got to go pack, anyway,

20:51.520 --> 20:54.768
but thank you so much for everything.

20:55.110 --> 20:56.037
Sure.

20:58.220 --> 21:02.554
Hey! What's all this about
me returning the wagon?

21:03.740 --> 21:05.232
I'm cancelling.

21:05.402 --> 21:09.170
One by one my entire family's
dropping like flies, so...

21:09.404 --> 21:11.374
nice homecoming, huh?

21:11.600 --> 21:14.272
Anyway, Amy and Ty just bailed too,

21:14.282 --> 21:16.960
so there's no one left
to drive the damn wagon.

21:17.045 --> 21:19.989
Well hey, look, I-I could drive a wagon.

21:20.053 --> 21:23.077
You mean like...
come on the camping trip?

21:23.840 --> 21:25.370
I'm game if you are.

21:27.277 --> 21:28.944
Lou!
Hope you've got room for one more

21:28.970 --> 21:31.610
in that wagon of yours! Uh, sorry, what?

21:31.674 --> 21:33.818
Well, you said you wanted
me to be more assertive.

21:33.829 --> 21:36.656
So Wyatt told me that you
were testing out a new idea

21:36.672 --> 21:37.930
for the Dude Ranch and I thought,

21:37.957 --> 21:40.138
hey,
I am the manager of said Dude Ranch,

21:40.160 --> 21:42.176
I should assert myself, and tag along.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.957
Oh, but you know what, this...

21:43.989 --> 21:45.930
it's really more of a family thing.

21:45.957 --> 21:48.000
- Are you going?
- Um...

21:48.670 --> 21:49.909
- Hey!
- Hey.

21:49.968 --> 21:51.700
Uh, everyone.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.682
Peter, are you going on this
camping trip thing, too?

21:55.195 --> 21:58.095
- Yeah, why, are you?
- Peter, you're coming?

21:58.200 --> 22:00.309
Well, Georgie invited me, is...

22:00.362 --> 22:02.842
- Was that not okay?
- Oh, no.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.880
No, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine.

22:04.912 --> 22:07.008
Mitch, you're goin', too?

22:07.210 --> 22:08.970
Yes. Yeah.

22:09.069 --> 22:12.439
No one else could drive the wagon... so.

22:14.690 --> 22:16.464
Okay, great.

22:16.496 --> 22:19.630
- Well, that'll be great.
- Yeah. Yeah, it sure will.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.562
Great! Well, let's get goin'.

22:32.039 --> 22:33.707
You guys ready for this?

22:33.810 --> 22:35.130
Yeah.

22:37.150 --> 22:38.522
Go ahead, we're not pioneers yet.

22:38.538 --> 22:39.765
Yes!

22:41.941 --> 22:44.672
Hey Georgie, Adam, say hi.

22:45.190 --> 22:47.834
Oh, how can you say no to that face?!

22:47.856 --> 22:49.872
We're at the Dude Ranch gates. Come!

22:51.978 --> 22:54.678
Go ahead. Go. Have some real fun.

22:54.784 --> 22:56.213
Really? Are-are you sure?

22:56.234 --> 22:58.128
Yes, just be home before curfew, okay?

22:58.160 --> 23:00.100
We're going to your event first thing.

23:00.430 --> 23:03.712
Thanks guys, really.
I'm... I'm so grateful.

23:03.728 --> 23:04.693
Yeah.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.304
"Grateful", huh?
A little much, don't you think?

23:11.026 --> 23:13.556
Actually, we should probably talk.

23:13.573 --> 23:15.552
Lou! Let's roll out, huh?

23:18.070 --> 23:18.741
Later.

23:18.778 --> 23:19.722
Okay.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.056
The conclusion I've come to?

23:23.082 --> 23:26.160
The cliches are correct.
Love does make you blind.

23:26.260 --> 23:28.213
I'm no fool, I did the math.

23:28.250 --> 23:30.405
There was a huge probability
that I'd be dumped

23:30.421 --> 23:31.824
by someone like Olivia.

23:32.005 --> 23:34.602
But did I see it coming? No!

23:35.170 --> 23:36.997
Are you glad you made the
move from Pioneer Village

23:37.018 --> 23:38.853
- to Heartbreak Hotel?
- I am.

23:38.965 --> 23:41.712
- But I do have to be home early.
- I know, yeah, you will.

23:41.733 --> 23:43.941
And also, 'cause I remembered
something that you uh,

23:44.016 --> 23:45.872
you said in one of
your Kim gush-a-thons.

23:45.909 --> 23:47.040
"Gush-a-thons?" Really?

23:47.066 --> 23:49.658
Yeah, really.
Yeah, so aside from a nutritious meal

23:49.696 --> 23:52.266
and rest, almighty Coach Kim
recommends taking a break

23:52.288 --> 23:53.594
the day before an event.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.920
- That is true.
- It's very, very true.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.578
So I've made you a nutritious dinner,

23:57.632 --> 23:59.754
and I set my alarm on my
phone to go off 20 minutes

23:59.770 --> 24:01.230
before we have to go
so I can get you home

24:01.242 --> 24:03.018
and you can get like,
a perfect eight-hour sleep.

24:03.580 --> 24:06.048
Thank you. You're amazing, really.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.602
I made a break-up playlist
of songs in C-minor.

24:10.770 --> 24:13.952
That's the key that best
epitomizes the lovesick soul.

24:14.441 --> 24:17.991
Spoiler alert, tears will be shed.

24:25.690 --> 24:27.066
Oh! Okay!

24:35.160 --> 24:36.197
So...

24:36.700 --> 24:40.197
there is one thing that every
pioneer family must know

24:40.218 --> 24:42.320
in order to survive...

24:42.636 --> 24:44.204
how to build a fire.

24:44.496 --> 24:46.506
Good old flint, and steel.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.304
Just like the pioneers used.
I Googled it.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.594
Oh, okay. So you just um...

24:54.480 --> 24:57.632
take this piece here, and you...

24:58.853 --> 25:00.520
okay, you just...

25:00.960 --> 25:01.568
I think it's like...

25:01.584 --> 25:03.130
Oh, you have to put the uh,

25:03.178 --> 25:04.901
char cloth on the tinder to get a flame.

25:04.922 --> 25:06.544
Right, right, right, yes,
no, no, no, I knew that.

25:06.565 --> 25:08.360
I just-I forgot, okay.

25:08.496 --> 25:10.357
- And then I think...
- Oh, here.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.157
I used to be a Girl Guide.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.597
I went all the way to Ranger status,

25:14.624 --> 25:18.053
because I couldn't get
enough of those badges.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.373
So uh...

25:24.710 --> 25:26.901
that's how you do it.

25:29.183 --> 25:30.683
Oh yeah...

25:41.392 --> 25:44.144
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:44.277 --> 25:48.400
I think I set my tape
measure down somewhere.

25:48.656 --> 25:51.296
- Have you seen it?
- Um... no.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.498
How is that install coming?

25:53.546 --> 25:56.560
Oh, it's goin' good; Peter went camping.

26:00.229 --> 26:01.376
You all right?

26:01.445 --> 26:03.696
Yeah, it's just work stuff.

26:03.717 --> 26:06.090
Ah. Well...

26:06.350 --> 26:08.842
you know,
starting a new business together,

26:08.869 --> 26:11.220
there's gonna be a few growing pains.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.549
And speaking of your work,
Star's running again tomorrow,

26:14.565 --> 26:16.080
can you watch the race with me?

26:16.101 --> 26:18.634
Lisa has to have another play-by-play.

26:18.830 --> 26:19.648
Uh, actually, Jack,

26:19.669 --> 26:21.786
I don't think Star is
gonna be racing tomorrow.

26:21.813 --> 26:24.106
Oh? Why not?

26:29.290 --> 26:31.744
I can see why Georgie
ran off with my son.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.608
Not that she doesn't
deserve to celebrate.

26:34.650 --> 26:38.064
Wyatt told me the news.
Europe, that is so exciting!

26:38.400 --> 26:39.365
What's that?

26:40.312 --> 26:42.052
Oh. Am I wrong?

26:42.096 --> 26:45.648
Uh, Wyatt told me that Georgie
was going to that program.

26:45.690 --> 26:47.589
Could you excuse us just for a minute?

26:47.605 --> 26:50.037
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

26:50.096 --> 26:51.525
I uh...

26:52.550 --> 26:54.058
I can afford it now.

26:54.370 --> 26:57.104
I tried to talk to you about it earlier,
but...

26:57.120 --> 26:59.210
Well, hold on, how can you afford it?

26:59.242 --> 27:01.536
I sold my Maggie's franchise shares.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.626
And don't worry,
when I told Georgie about Europe,

27:03.642 --> 27:05.088
she assumed we were both paying for it,

27:05.104 --> 27:07.029
and I didn't correct her, so...

27:08.749 --> 27:11.150
That's why she was acting so weird.

27:11.178 --> 27:12.997
Why are you so mad?

27:13.013 --> 27:14.810
This is what we both wanted for her.

27:14.906 --> 27:16.490
It was just cost holding us back,

27:16.506 --> 27:18.400
and now I can pay, it's...

27:18.426 --> 27:20.549
it's okay that you weren't able to.

27:21.060 --> 27:22.800
I was always able to, Lou.

27:22.860 --> 27:25.008
I just wasn't ready; I wanted some time.

27:25.029 --> 27:27.248
But of course you just
barreled ahead without me.

27:27.264 --> 27:29.285
Because I thought this
is what we both wanted!

27:29.301 --> 27:30.944
Yes, it was, but what about Georgie?!

27:31.100 --> 27:33.402
I mean, do-do you think
she's ready for that world?

27:33.429 --> 27:34.549
Emotionally?

27:34.610 --> 27:36.250
It's like I was saying to Jen last week,

27:36.266 --> 27:38.277
it's a potentially
toxic environment there.

27:38.298 --> 27:39.637
Those kids are under too much pressure,

27:39.653 --> 27:42.517
they've got too much money,
too much freedom.

27:42.554 --> 27:44.757
You were talking to Jen last week?

27:45.190 --> 27:47.237
Well,
I was visiting friends in Vancouver.

27:47.253 --> 27:49.658
We... we just had dinner.

27:53.768 --> 27:55.778
- What?
- Okay.

27:58.430 --> 28:00.762
- That's great.
- What's great? What?

28:03.137 --> 28:05.004
Those guys were insane, right?

28:05.140 --> 28:06.805
I felt some brief moments of joy.

28:06.821 --> 28:08.341
Oh, you felt brief moments of joy,
we won!

28:08.357 --> 28:09.910
Oh, good job, Adam.

28:10.176 --> 28:11.866
It was a really fun night out.

28:11.980 --> 28:13.328
I'm sorry for making us leave early.

28:13.354 --> 28:13.397
But thank you for dragging me out here.

28:13.397 --> 28:15.493
Ah, it's okay, no, you're welcome.
But thank you for dragging me out here.

28:15.493 --> 28:15.594
But thank you for dragging me out here.

28:17.060 --> 28:17.722
You're welcome.

28:17.744 --> 28:18.949
Wow!

28:20.282 --> 28:22.720
Wait, what level are we on?

28:23.070 --> 28:25.770
Um... three, I think.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.674
I would've said four.

28:28.190 --> 28:30.714
Do any of us know where the car is?

28:31.730 --> 28:33.696
Seriously, guys, I've gotta get home!

28:33.728 --> 28:34.661
It's okay, don't worry.

28:34.672 --> 28:36.997
There's only like,
five levels in this place, so...

28:37.160 --> 28:38.858
the car's gonna be on one of them.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.640
We'll be outta here in no time, promise.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.909
- What's happening?
- Um... I don't know.

29:09.536 --> 29:11.738
Wyatt, this is a medical centre.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.989
Yeah. Yeah,
my friend's Dad's got an office here,

29:14.005 --> 29:15.573
so they said I could park for free.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.360
But these places don't
have normal hours.

29:17.376 --> 29:20.442
- They lock up early.
- Oh yeah, duh!

29:20.464 --> 29:22.970
I'm an idiot.
They-they gave me a fob thingy for that.

29:22.992 --> 29:26.090
- Okay, let's use it.
- Yeah, I will, hold on.

29:35.260 --> 29:36.304
Wait...

29:38.032 --> 29:40.072
we're trapped, aren't we?

29:55.942 --> 29:58.310
Oh, I'm not gonna eat that.

30:04.932 --> 30:06.502
Hey, you know what they say,

30:06.720 --> 30:08.261
nothing relieves frustrations

30:08.277 --> 30:10.400
like a go on the old butter churn.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.565
- What a disaster, huh?
- Ah...

30:14.780 --> 30:18.160
Thanks for staying.
You're a good friend.

30:19.998 --> 30:21.833
Uh, yeah. Lou, I...

30:21.930 --> 30:24.144
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

30:24.192 --> 30:26.453
Um, you know, ever since you told me

30:26.470 --> 30:28.768
that you were back home now for good,

30:29.210 --> 30:31.301
um...
I've been wanting to tell you this,

30:31.317 --> 30:33.125
and I just, I-I haven't...

30:34.180 --> 30:36.720
I guess I haven't been able
to figure out how to do it,

30:36.741 --> 30:38.816
and like you said,
we are good friends, so...

30:38.837 --> 30:40.650
Mitch, stop.

30:44.060 --> 30:45.114
What is it?

30:47.960 --> 30:49.589
I asked Maya to marry me.

30:50.816 --> 30:52.530
And she said yes.

30:54.314 --> 30:55.685
So... I...

30:57.856 --> 30:59.296
I'm engaged.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.488
Wow, that's...

31:04.954 --> 31:08.522
wow. That-I'm-I'm surprised,
what a surprise.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.096
Yeah, you haven't mentioned her lately,

31:10.112 --> 31:11.658
so I kinda thought you
guys were on the outs.

31:11.685 --> 31:14.666
Yeah, no.
No, she's just, she's away right now.

31:14.693 --> 31:17.146
She's in India, she's doing
this whole yoga retreat thing.

31:17.173 --> 31:18.106
Right.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.106
You know, actually I um...

31:20.730 --> 31:22.346
I asked her at the airport.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.413
It's crazy, right?
I mean, I didn't plan anything,

31:25.440 --> 31:27.962
We were just saying goodbye,
and I just...

31:28.367 --> 31:30.067
I said, marry me.

31:31.550 --> 31:32.757
I didn't have a ring, or anything.

31:32.773 --> 31:33.808
Wow.

31:34.670 --> 31:36.426
Uh, that's crazy.

31:36.677 --> 31:37.605
Yeah.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.301
Congratulations, Mitch, really.

31:39.317 --> 31:42.005
Yeah. Well, thank you.

31:42.917 --> 31:44.746
Soup's on! Finally!

31:46.190 --> 31:48.218
- Well, I guess that's us.
- Yeah.

31:49.093 --> 31:50.096
Whoa!

32:01.450 --> 32:03.168
So what are we gonna do?

32:03.189 --> 32:05.477
After messing with my wife's horses,

32:05.493 --> 32:06.485
and threatening you two,

32:06.501 --> 32:09.157
the first thing I wanna
do is go over there,

32:09.173 --> 32:11.504
and take that Laura down a notch or two.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.510
And then she goes straight
to the papers, Jack.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.965
Blame it all on me.

32:15.610 --> 32:16.885
On us.

32:17.590 --> 32:18.544
She's got us trapped.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.850
Yeah, it's a tough situation, for sure.

32:21.950 --> 32:23.717
But you and Ty, you stepped in,

32:23.733 --> 32:25.936
you stopped her from making it worse.

32:25.960 --> 32:29.413
Star won't be racing,
and that's the important thing.

32:30.340 --> 32:32.517
Wait, so you're agreeing with Laura?

32:33.090 --> 32:34.720
We should just move on,
and forget this ever happened?

32:34.741 --> 32:37.344
Oh, absolutely not, Lisa needs to know.

32:37.397 --> 32:38.954
Fairfield is her business,

32:38.970 --> 32:41.370
and she'll be the one to handle Laura.

32:41.390 --> 32:43.440
Okay, well,
what time is it where Lisa is right now?

32:43.461 --> 32:46.773
No, no, no, no.
We're not calling Lisa now.

32:46.789 --> 32:49.562
The last thing I wanna
do is give her bad news

32:49.578 --> 32:51.856
before she gets on a long flight.

32:51.898 --> 32:53.189
She'll be home soon enough,

32:53.210 --> 32:55.338
and we'll explain everything then.

33:00.202 --> 33:02.821
You two make a good team, remember that.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.024
Well, I followed your
authentic recipe to a "t," Lou.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.070
You might wanna think
about changing your menu.

33:13.173 --> 33:14.912
I'm not sure your fancy New York family

33:14.922 --> 33:17.680
will be able to handle
bean stew and salt pork.

33:17.780 --> 33:20.053
But I mean, it could become
some kind of crazed fad diet,

33:20.064 --> 33:22.352
like the "Pioneer Food Plan,"

33:22.384 --> 33:23.632
or, "The Colonial Cleanse."

33:23.664 --> 33:25.754
Jen,
could you just be quiet for a moment?

33:25.792 --> 33:26.586
Oh, I'm sorry, I know,

33:26.602 --> 33:27.978
I get a little Chatty Kathy sometimes.

33:27.994 --> 33:29.578
Pretty much all the time.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.426
Well,
at least I know how to communicate.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.522
What's that supposed to mean?

33:35.040 --> 33:36.533
It would've been nice
if you'd communicated

33:36.554 --> 33:38.560
that you were moving home and
overhauling your businesses

33:38.576 --> 33:39.824
that you hired me to run.

33:39.861 --> 33:42.320
Since when do I have to ask
your permission to do anything

33:42.330 --> 33:44.949
- with my businesses?!
- Since you hired me!

33:44.976 --> 33:46.240
Right, hired.

33:46.256 --> 33:49.290
That means you're my employee,
not my replacement.

33:49.338 --> 33:51.120
So maybe you should stop
trying to worm your way

33:51.146 --> 33:52.910
- into every aspect of my life.
- Wow.

33:52.933 --> 33:54.981
Playing matchmaker for ex-boyfriend,

33:54.992 --> 33:56.842
going for dinner with my ex-husband!

33:56.874 --> 34:00.069
Whoa, whoa, okay!
Why don't we just cool out here,

34:00.112 --> 34:01.829
and everybody go to sleep?

34:01.941 --> 34:04.220
- Fine, that's a great idea.
- Give me the bowl.

34:04.323 --> 34:06.257
Please. Thank you.

34:20.210 --> 34:21.652
You got anything?

34:22.112 --> 34:25.648
Zero bars. We're in a concrete tower.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.869
I can't believe
I'm gonna miss my event.

34:28.889 --> 34:30.543
No, stop, stop.

34:30.585 --> 34:32.080
This place opens up super early,

34:32.106 --> 34:33.487
I'm gonna drive you straight home,

34:33.536 --> 34:34.420
it's gonna be fine.

34:34.437 --> 34:36.590
Nothing about this is fine, Wyatt.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.159
Tomorrow is really important for me.

34:38.176 --> 34:41.002
We know! It's all that you talk about!

34:42.393 --> 34:44.795
Sorry, that's the heartbreak talking.

34:45.397 --> 34:46.889
Adam, the kind of training I'm doing

34:46.896 --> 34:49.040
requires a lot of dedication, and focus!

34:49.056 --> 34:50.770
Does it also take over your life?!

34:50.826 --> 34:52.074
'Cause lately all I hear from Wyatt

34:52.096 --> 34:54.341
is how you can't even
answer a text these days.

34:54.752 --> 34:56.581
That you never have time for him.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.517
Wyatt, is that true?

35:05.296 --> 35:08.560
Wow. Why did I let
you talk me into this?

35:08.850 --> 35:11.648
- I am such an idiot!
- Okay, seriously!

35:11.680 --> 35:13.790
Where is my girlfriend?

35:13.890 --> 35:15.056
Where did you put her?

35:15.088 --> 35:17.114
Is she down here? Georgie?

35:17.178 --> 35:20.378
Anybody? I don't know, I can't see her.

35:20.416 --> 35:22.256
Because the Georgie I know
would be finding the humour

35:22.266 --> 35:24.405
in this because it's one stupid event.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.384
And there's gonna be a
million more exactly like it

35:26.400 --> 35:27.904
on your glamorous European tour!

35:27.925 --> 35:30.714
If you think I find this
funny in the slightest

35:30.757 --> 35:32.368
then you don't know me at all!

35:32.688 --> 35:34.090
If I miss this event tomorrow,

35:34.101 --> 35:36.610
there is no European tour, okay?!

35:55.808 --> 35:57.330
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.677
You uh, you mind if I join you?

36:00.709 --> 36:02.224
I couldn't sleep either.

36:02.800 --> 36:03.909
Sure.

36:19.690 --> 36:20.944
You know, Lou...

36:21.890 --> 36:23.541
I don't get how you could be afraid

36:23.557 --> 36:26.230
that anybody would ever replace you.

36:27.332 --> 36:29.840
You are without a doubt,

36:30.208 --> 36:31.781
one hundred percent,

36:32.389 --> 36:33.728
one of a kind.

36:34.921 --> 36:36.151
Very funny.

36:48.050 --> 36:50.997
Ow!
Oh, I think I have some ash in my eye.

36:51.040 --> 36:51.960
- What? You serious?
- Yeah!

36:51.980 --> 36:53.626
- Okay well, hold on, hold on.
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

36:53.658 --> 36:54.389
It's okay, it's okay,

36:54.416 --> 36:56.426
hold on, oh yeah, yeah, hold on.

36:56.453 --> 36:58.300
- Look up.
- Ow. Ah!

36:58.320 --> 37:00.112
Okay, I think I got it.

37:06.340 --> 37:09.274
Um, yeah. Yeah.

37:10.340 --> 37:12.352
Sorry, h-how do you feel?

37:15.510 --> 37:17.808
I feel fine. Thanks.

37:20.585 --> 37:22.953
- Okay. Good.
- Um...

37:25.674 --> 37:26.976
I'm just gonna...

37:28.810 --> 37:29.786
good night.

37:30.458 --> 37:31.498
Good night.

37:59.336 --> 38:02.006
Hey... do you need a hand?

38:05.864 --> 38:08.522
Listen, I'm sorry.

38:08.930 --> 38:10.437
I shouldn'tve gone ahead with Europe

38:10.448 --> 38:12.192
without talking to you first.

38:13.570 --> 38:16.698
I was just proud of myself
that I could do it on my own.

38:17.275 --> 38:19.376
I get it, you know, I do.

38:19.408 --> 38:21.109
Um, it's just...

38:22.550 --> 38:24.165
it's a big step for Georgie,

38:24.181 --> 38:27.109
and I think I just
have trouble admitting

38:27.130 --> 38:28.850
that she's ready to take it.

38:29.525 --> 38:30.762
I don't know why.

38:30.789 --> 38:33.760
She's growing up one way or the other.

38:34.506 --> 38:37.456
Why not let her do it while
she's accomplishing something...

38:37.632 --> 38:38.768
remarkable?

38:43.470 --> 38:44.560
I'm in.

38:45.340 --> 38:47.482
Let's do it, we'll-we'll split the cost.

38:48.580 --> 38:49.594
Thank you.

38:52.626 --> 38:56.056
Guess I better go mend fence number two.

38:58.220 --> 39:00.760
She's doing a good job. I know that.

39:01.290 --> 39:04.245
This uh,
pioneer retreat had something right.

39:04.261 --> 39:05.820
It's good to disconnect.

39:05.882 --> 39:06.832
Let go.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.653
This thing with you and Jen...

39:09.669 --> 39:11.850
It's not a thing, Lou. It's nothing.

39:11.877 --> 39:15.253
Whatever it is, I'm letting it go.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.816
I have to let a lot of things go.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.490
Hey. Hey! Hey!

39:26.506 --> 39:28.272
Hey, what're you guys doing here?!

39:28.293 --> 39:30.106
Ah! Oh, guys, we're free! Let's go!

39:38.130 --> 39:39.498
We're going to make it!

39:39.584 --> 39:41.114
- Hope exists!
- See? I told you,

39:41.125 --> 39:43.546
I told you I would get
Cinderella to the ball.

39:46.505 --> 39:48.105
- What's that?
- I don't know. Hold...

39:48.304 --> 39:50.426
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

39:55.882 --> 39:57.750
Okay, wait, wait.

40:02.912 --> 40:06.176
Hey, how'd the pioneer expedition go?

40:06.230 --> 40:08.949
It was fine. Is that coffee?

40:08.965 --> 40:09.818
Yeah.

40:09.845 --> 40:12.100
Hey, is Georgie up?
We've gotta get going.

40:12.122 --> 40:14.048
Well,
I thought she went camping with you.

40:14.090 --> 40:16.261
No, no,
she went out with Wyatt and Adam.

40:16.277 --> 40:17.882
Well, Georgie's not here.

40:17.898 --> 40:21.310
What? Well, where is she then?!

40:23.706 --> 40:26.453
Uh, Georgie? Where are you?
Are you okay?

40:29.350 --> 40:30.586
You're kidding.

40:33.460 --> 40:35.136
I can't believe this!

40:36.980 --> 40:38.346
I'm so sorry, Georgie.

40:38.357 --> 40:40.805
For... for everything.

40:41.248 --> 40:42.645
Really, really sorry.

40:43.620 --> 40:44.730
Can you just say something, please?

40:44.746 --> 40:48.010
Like, I'm trying to...
I'm trying to fix this.

40:52.218 --> 40:54.110
Come on, let's go honey,
we can still make it.

40:54.144 --> 40:56.416
No. We can't.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.042
It's over.

41:04.010 --> 41:05.397
What's going on with you guys?
You need a ride?

41:05.434 --> 41:08.050
No, I'm gonna wait here 'til help comes.

41:09.184 --> 41:10.384
Me too.

41:28.542 --> 41:31.623
Okay, thanks, Peter.

41:31.818 --> 41:33.306
I'll see you guys soon.

41:33.338 --> 41:35.450
Well, I'm real sorry to hear that, Lou,

41:35.466 --> 41:37.178
but she's safe and sound, right?

41:37.200 --> 41:41.190
Yes, she's fine,
she's just totally devastated.

41:42.670 --> 41:43.456
Shoot.

41:43.482 --> 41:45.552
- I've gotta go pick up Katie.
- Okay.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.549
I can't believe Georgie
missed her event.

41:48.592 --> 41:50.500
So what does this mean for Europe, then?

41:50.533 --> 41:53.070
I don't know, but it doesn't look good.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.037
Oh, it's Lisa.

41:58.330 --> 42:00.858
Hi honey, is your flight on time?

42:01.690 --> 42:04.170
What? A turn for the worse?

42:04.880 --> 42:07.514
Well, of course you need to stay.

42:08.997 --> 42:11.162
Ah no, Star's not racing,

42:11.184 --> 42:14.053
I actually wanted to
talk to you about that.

42:15.445 --> 42:19.157
Oh, Laura told you Star is racing today?

42:19.189 --> 42:20.074
What?

42:20.186 --> 42:22.181
She's gonna be so doped she
won't even feel her leg.

42:22.197 --> 42:23.653
- She's gonna break it!
- What is Laura thinking?!

42:23.664 --> 42:25.205
- Ty, we've gotta stop her!
- If we leave now,

42:25.220 --> 42:26.080
we might be able to make it, okay?

42:26.096 --> 42:27.381
- Go, go, go!
- Yeah!

42:27.642 --> 42:29.872
Okay, hi, hi Lise, yeah, I'm-I'm here.

42:31.070 --> 42:35.258
Oh. Oh of course,
you go talk to the doctor,

42:35.770 --> 42:38.405
and I miss you, I love you.

42:39.870 --> 42:40.709
Bye.
