00:01.969 --> 00:02.002
Tonight's episode
concerns a collision

00:03.837 --> 00:03.871
between a freight train
and a passenger train

00:06.474 --> 00:06.507
in southern California.

00:08.276 --> 00:12.513
It was written and filmed before
the tragic Metrolink crash

00:12.546 --> 00:16.350
near Chatsworth, California
on September 12th.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.420
All of us at "Numb3rs" extend
our thoughts and prayers

00:19.453 --> 00:22.756
to the victims of this accident
and to their families.

00:22.790 --> 00:26.294
Because of this recent tragedy,
the images may be difficult

00:26.327 --> 00:28.329
for some viewers to watch.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.464
We want to let you know, so you
can use the appropriate

00:30.498 --> 00:32.766
discretion in your home.

00:33.834 --> 00:40.774
*

00:40.808 --> 00:42.810
(horn blaring)

00:49.650 --> 00:53.754
* Keep your weight
on the Dead Man's Handle *

00:53.787 --> 00:56.690
* Or the steam brake
is bound to fail... *

00:56.724 --> 00:58.192
(alarm beeps)

00:58.226 --> 01:00.761
Tim, it's
milepost 112-9.

01:00.794 --> 01:06.334
Roger that. MP 112-9.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.702
Dispatch, this is
Desert Pacific Rail.

01:08.736 --> 01:13.674
Just passing MP 112-9.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.444
We'll be at the switch
in five minutes.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.645
Got you, Desert Pacific Rail.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.480
What's your speed?

01:19.513 --> 01:21.349
We are highballing at 20.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.583
What are you pulling?

01:22.616 --> 01:24.852
10,000 tons
of American ingenuity.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.787
(over radio):
All right.

01:34.662 --> 01:38.499
* There's just one more bridge
left to cross *

01:38.532 --> 01:42.170
* Keep her moving
or the day is lost *

01:42.203 --> 01:44.205
* Dead Man's Handle

01:45.606 --> 01:48.209
* Dead Man's Handle...

01:48.242 --> 01:49.843
I'll keep
an eye on her.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.612
* Dead Man's Handle

01:51.645 --> 01:55.383
* Keep your mind
on the journey's end *

01:56.417 --> 01:57.918
Do you mind?

01:57.951 --> 02:02.756
* Look down, look down,
look down... *

02:02.790 --> 02:04.592
You have an audience.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.859
Sorry.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.895
We're cool.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.164
* Look down,
and you'll never... *

02:10.198 --> 02:11.365
Thank you.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.900
* On the tracks again

02:12.933 --> 02:14.502
Pretty soon,
that'll be you

02:14.535 --> 02:16.337
with a pretty girl
like that.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.771
No way.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.310
(phone ringing)

02:22.343 --> 02:23.377
William, what's wrong?

02:23.411 --> 02:24.612
Hey, can I ride
up front with you?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.547
Well, maybe on
the return trip, okay?

02:26.580 --> 02:27.848
You know you're not supposed
to call me

02:27.881 --> 02:29.783
unless it's an emergency.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.619
Okay, Dad.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.655
* Ease the brake,
stretch out your hand *

02:34.688 --> 02:36.890
* The Dead Man's Handle

02:38.859 --> 02:40.661
(bell dinging)

02:42.563 --> 02:44.198
* The Dead Man's Handle

02:44.232 --> 02:47.801
* Keep your mind
on the journey's end. *

02:50.971 --> 02:53.574
The flag's not up.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.942
He didn't make the switch.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.277
I know.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.878
Dispatch, this is
Desert Pacific Rail.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.880
- Do you read me? Over.
- We're not going to make it.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.882
(screeching)

03:01.915 --> 03:02.783
I can't get it stopped.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.218
Dispatch, this is
Desert Pacific Rail.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.886
- Do you read me?
- Jump, Tim.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.257
- Dispatch...
- Tim, jump!

03:16.930 --> 03:20.234
Dispatch, San Jose Limited,
coming your way.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.236
(static crackles)

03:25.373 --> 03:28.576
Dispatch?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.756
Young man...

03:42.790 --> 03:44.458
I'm going to go see my dad.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.594
Oop! You know you
can't go up there

03:46.627 --> 03:47.928
when the train
is moving.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.497
- He said I could...
- William.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.865
I may be old,
but I ain't stupid.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.469
What's going on up there?

03:55.503 --> 03:56.504
What's on my track?

03:56.537 --> 03:59.340
Stay in your seats!
Hold on!

03:59.373 --> 04:01.375
Come on!
(brakes screeching)

04:01.409 --> 04:01.442
- Mom!
- William!

04:02.676 --> 04:03.677
I got him!

04:20.394 --> 04:22.563
I mean, when I started
at the FBI,

04:22.596 --> 04:24.432
I figure, you know,
I'm doing something good.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.634
I'm fighting the fight.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.870
It just sounds so...

04:29.903 --> 04:31.472
old-fashioned.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.441
It just sounds so naive now.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.076
No, no.
It doesn't.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.878
It's all just one big
compromise.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.012
I'm telling you.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.816
One big personality clash
with redundant paperwork.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.818
The boss is second-guessing
every move,

04:44.852 --> 04:46.587
second-guessing
their bosses,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.789
everyone just trying
to keep their job.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.325
Nobody's got any guts.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.894
Yeah, well,
you got guts.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.798
I feel lost.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.667
I feel like...

04:59.700 --> 05:01.435
I don't know why
I'm in it anymore.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.508
Hey. Who's winning?
(phone rings)

05:07.541 --> 05:09.510
Actually, uh,
I got to get out of here.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.946
DON:
Yeah. Eppes.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.083
I'm so tired, I could sleep
standing up.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.719
The stakeout was
worth it.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.920
I loved the look
on that guy's face

05:19.953 --> 05:24.625
when we sashayed in there
instead of that teenage girl.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.560
We got two days away
from the creeps.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.396
You got any plans?

05:28.429 --> 05:30.931
Whatever sport
is on TV.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.033
(door opens)

05:33.066 --> 05:34.034
Got a train crash.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.836
- Call NTSB.
- They called us.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.138
Possible hazardous materials.
High threat, urban area.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.607
By hazardous
materials,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.643
you mean
old computer batteries?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.545
No rest for the weary.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.515
(clamoring)

05:50.150 --> 05:51.885
(siren approaching)

05:56.123 --> 05:58.025
(horn sounds)

06:03.631 --> 06:05.098
It's all right.
I got you.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.934
DON: I want to know what was on
every one of those trains,

06:06.967 --> 06:09.136
so e-mail me that waybill, ASAP.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.772
Send it to my phone.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.407
You think we're dealing
with anything toxic here?

06:13.441 --> 06:14.374
Still checking.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.876
We might have to evacuate
the entire area.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.478
DON: The press is going to
be all over this.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.046
LAPD's got 'em
blocked off a mile away.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.651
Where do you guys need us?

06:23.684 --> 06:25.185
- What do you think?
- I could use the manpower.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.219
You got it.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.188
Why don't you go see
if you can find the NTSB,

06:28.221 --> 06:29.923
and you go with him,
all right?

06:31.459 --> 06:33.026
Hey, I got her.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.695
I got her.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.831
- Let's go.
- Easy, easy... easy.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.503
Here.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.904
Easy, easy.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.039
We're setting triage up
over there.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.140
Okay. I'll bring more over.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.845
Anybody in there?!

06:53.213 --> 06:55.082
Oh...!

06:55.115 --> 06:56.249
- David!
- Anybody in there?!

06:56.283 --> 06:57.751
- David! Get out of here!
- There are people inside...

06:57.785 --> 06:59.152
We've got a toxic leak!

06:59.186 --> 07:01.455
There's a toxic leak!

07:01.489 --> 07:03.991
Everyone, get away
from the tanker!

07:07.528 --> 07:09.963
(sirens wailing)

07:18.205 --> 07:20.974
(clamoring)

07:21.008 --> 07:24.111
(chainsaw buzzing)

07:27.915 --> 07:29.950
I have a press conference
to do in ten minutes.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.151
All right.
So what do you need?

07:31.184 --> 07:33.253
We've still got dozens
more people to pull out.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.656
We're going to have
to go for the numbers.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.024
Got to save as many
lives as possible.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.927
Listen, there are still
passengers here in this car

07:39.960 --> 07:41.495
underneath
the leaking tanker.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.731
By the time we get to
them, they'll be dead.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.132
Look, let me just see what
my guys can do, all right?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.166
Over here! A problem!

07:47.968 --> 07:50.170
Okay, so who knows what?
Talk to me!

07:50.203 --> 07:51.004
Sheriff's Department
is evacuating

07:51.038 --> 07:52.940
a five-mile radius
around the site.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.107
Then you guys
should go help FD

07:54.141 --> 07:55.175
with extractions
under that tanker.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.209
All right.
What's the chemical?

07:56.243 --> 07:58.979
- What do we need to know?
- Methyl isocyanate.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.748
It's used in the manufacture
of polyurethane foam,

08:00.781 --> 08:02.916
pesticides and plastics
and that's the same

08:02.950 --> 08:04.985
chemical that killed over
3,000 people in Bhopal, India.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.787
DON:
It's basically a weapon.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.055
So how bad's the leak?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.857
Well, if it's bad,
we're all dead.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.124
- Yeah. Eppes.
- Hazmat measured

08:11.158 --> 08:13.060
two parts per million--
not fatal.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.663
If you start tearing up, or
start to smell something sweet,

08:15.696 --> 08:17.130
that indicates
four parts per million,

08:17.164 --> 08:19.066
- in which case, run.
- But even small

08:19.099 --> 08:21.101
amounts could be lethal
to the wounded people, right?

08:21.134 --> 08:23.103
It's transported in liquid form.
When it hits the air,

08:23.136 --> 08:25.639
it vaporizes but,
with water, it overheats

08:25.673 --> 08:27.307
and combusts,
releasing a toxic cloud.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.142
We need to get those people
out of here

08:29.176 --> 08:30.143
before this thing explodes.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.144
All right. Let's go.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.012
DON:
You guys be careful.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.814
So the black box
is basically destroyed.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.048
It's not going
to help us.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.216
Trains are monitored
by computer-- I'll get

08:36.249 --> 08:37.818
the electronic records from
the company's hard drive.

08:37.851 --> 08:38.819
See if you
can find out

08:38.852 --> 08:40.788
who knew that
cargo was toxic.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.289
And dog the bomb squad until we
know what set it off, right?

08:42.322 --> 08:43.857
I need a list of all
National Security events

08:43.891 --> 08:45.793
in the last 24 hours.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.327
Are you thinking terrorism?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.697
Go. Go.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.931
Yeah, I'll hold.

08:50.964 --> 08:56.036
Excuse me.
Are you in charge?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.571
CHARLIE:
We're not quite at the level

08:57.605 --> 08:59.306
of rogue,
shape-shifting nanobots

08:59.339 --> 09:01.341
as described
in science fiction.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.845
However, we have made progress
in the real world-- swarmbots.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.748
Alone,
unsophisticated machines.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.083
But, working together,
with something like...

09:10.117 --> 09:12.820
like intelligence emerging.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.321
These are crash
investigators.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.289
Here. Check it out.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.793
So I program a task
for the swarm, right?

09:19.827 --> 09:21.929
Let's say mapping this room,

09:21.962 --> 09:23.964
and they try to accomplish
the goal of that task.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.133
Right now,
they're self-organizing.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.067
They've chosen
a leader.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.068
See, some jobs need
centralized control.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.004
- Others require swarm activity.
- Hey, Charlie,

09:31.038 --> 09:33.106
what happens
if I shoot the leader?

09:33.140 --> 09:35.242
They figure out

09:35.275 --> 09:37.110
who the next
best leader is.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.981
See that? Huh? Look.

09:41.014 --> 09:41.882
They just keep going.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.985
It's much more robust
and cooperative

09:45.018 --> 09:46.053
in a hostile environment
than people.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.790
You're familiar with eusocial
insects like bees

09:49.823 --> 09:50.991
and ants and termites.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.127
Well, they communicate through
pheromones-- scent clues.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.296
Like, "I'm a larva.
Take care of me."

09:56.329 --> 09:57.631
Or, "Food's this way."

09:57.665 --> 09:59.399
Or, "Danger! Attack!"

09:59.432 --> 10:01.969
Following smells
is called chemotaxis.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.137
My bots employ infotaxis,

10:04.171 --> 10:06.106
which is
a spatial search algorithm

10:06.139 --> 10:08.175
in which agents repeatedly
update guesses

10:08.208 --> 10:09.977
of an object's location.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.012
Each bot creates a model
of its local environment,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.247
it networks it,
and we get a collective picture.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.349
These things could
map my crash?

10:16.383 --> 10:17.284
That's what
I'm saying.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.687
I can reprogram them,
I can add lipstick

10:19.720 --> 10:21.354
cameras and
chemical sensors.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.760
The switch wasn't right.
We couldn't stop in time.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.162
- Why not?
- It's a redundant system,

10:29.196 --> 10:31.699
but everything seemed
to fail at once.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.201
Cutty exerted the right
amount of brake pressure

10:34.234 --> 10:37.705
for the tonnage,
but the train just kept going.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.140
Tell me about your
engineer-- Cutty Nagim.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.110
He wouldn't
abandon the train,

10:43.143 --> 10:46.279
even though we were sitting
on 2,000 tons of diesel.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.450
- Did you recover the body?
- Not yet.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.686
What kind of name is Nagim?

10:52.720 --> 10:56.456
Uh... Syrian, I think.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.125
Did he have
ties to Syria?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.226
Was he political?

10:59.259 --> 11:00.127
We're going
to find all this out.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.095
You might as well
just say what you know.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.232
Cutty was born and raised
in America.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.334
Oh. You know what, Tim?

11:07.367 --> 11:10.170
Maybe all the parts
in your redundant system

11:10.203 --> 11:13.106
just happened to fail
at the same time,

11:13.140 --> 11:14.942
but that passenger train missed
piercing a tanker

11:14.975 --> 11:17.978
carrying a lethal chemical
by about ten feet.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.780
Oh, that's just a matter
of time, Agent.

11:19.813 --> 11:23.150
Scary hazardous materials roll
through L.A. every single day

11:23.183 --> 11:25.819
on 100-year-old tracks
with rusty, unguarded switches.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.988
It's a miracle it
hasn't happened

11:28.021 --> 11:30.724
up to this point-- a miracle.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.128
Stay put.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.399
Hey, thanks for coming.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.034
Yeah, uh, so where
should I set up?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.269
In here.
I'm downloading the railroad's

11:42.302 --> 11:44.137
- electronic records.
- Okay.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.208
(sirens whooping)

11:48.241 --> 11:50.310
(crews clamoring,
tools clanking and whirring)

11:53.947 --> 11:55.215
This is much worse
than I thought.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.417
I don't know if my bots
can make a difference.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.320
Charlie, the people
we're going for

12:00.353 --> 12:01.454
are the lost causes.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.224
Anything we can do for them
is better than nothing.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.070
Hey... Hey, what's
the chemical count?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.006
It's the same--
two parts per million,

12:19.039 --> 12:20.540
but they haven't
located the leak yet.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.608
How many we got in here?

12:21.641 --> 12:24.011
Six remain that are still
giving off body heat,

12:24.044 --> 12:25.212
but they're buried deep inside.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.546
CHARLIE:
Hey.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.348
Can I set up over here?

12:28.381 --> 12:29.449
Yeah, sure, Charlie.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.821
Are these the, um...?

12:33.854 --> 12:34.955
The six still alive.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.424
That's, uh, Estella,
William Ramirez.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.092
They're the wife and son
of the engineer.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.193
Probably died in
the initial fireball.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.229
Frannie Driscoll, her daughter
was rescued earlier.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.464
And that's Doug Abbott, 21.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.233
He's, uh, traveling
with Susan Lang, 19.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.568
Jeffrey Knight,
railroad steward.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.870
He has a radio,
but it's dying.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.204
COLBY:
Hey, Mr. Knight,

12:51.238 --> 12:53.140
this is Agent Granger again.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.307
How're you doing in there?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.043
William and I
are hanging in.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.846
I can't see the others.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.814
WILLIAM: My leg hurts!
DAVID: You're a tough guy right?

13:00.848 --> 13:04.351
Where's my dad?
Is he okay?

13:06.887 --> 13:09.022
Hey, buddy,

13:09.056 --> 13:11.258
your dad wants
you to be brave, okay?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.592
You can do that, right?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.062
(static)

13:15.095 --> 13:16.363
Radio's dead.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.498
So can we get them out of there?

13:18.531 --> 13:20.133
We're worried about
destabilizing the wreckage,

13:20.167 --> 13:21.234
or worse, the tanker.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.003
Well, my bots should help
with that.

13:23.036 --> 13:23.871
How?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.372
They're going to explore the
debris.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.508
They'll radio back
information on toxicity,

13:28.541 --> 13:29.910
temperature, topography.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.879
I'll add that
to your infrared layout.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.380
We'll get a detailed map,

13:33.413 --> 13:35.415
and we're going to get these
people out of there safely.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.417
All right, I think I can get to
this one right here.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.286
Yeah?
I'm gonna go for it.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.821
All right, Charlie.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.357
What did the bomb squad say?

13:44.391 --> 13:46.426
Do they have any idea
what caused the derailment?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.161
They can't find
the set-off point.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.263
It could be on the track,
in which case,

13:50.297 --> 13:51.364
it would be under
the wreckage.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.534
Or a bomb could've been
on the cargo train itself,

13:54.567 --> 13:56.269
the engineer was Syrian.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.338
Either way,
it derails.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.306
The passenger train

13:59.339 --> 14:01.408
pierces the tanker,
ignites the chemicals,

14:01.441 --> 14:04.945
releases toxic gas
into a densely populated area.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.379
What are you basing
your theory on?

14:06.413 --> 14:08.148
Don's thinking terrorism.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.983
What, are you talking for me?
Don't do that.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.084
You implied that...

14:11.118 --> 14:12.652
You need to listen more and talk
less. You understand?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.522
So we got no national security
events in the area

14:15.555 --> 14:17.457
in the last 24 hours.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.992
I'm running
a Risk Measure

14:19.026 --> 14:20.460
with data from the railroad,

14:20.493 --> 14:21.962
the chemical
company, the NSA

14:21.995 --> 14:24.197
and the FBI
Counter-terrorism Unit.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.299
But a terrorist attack
is not well-supported.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.468
Right-- and what'd the
dispatcher say?

14:28.501 --> 14:30.103
James Malin. NTSB interviewed
him on the scene,

14:30.137 --> 14:31.271
did a drug-alcohol test,

14:31.304 --> 14:33.440
then I released him
to go to his second job.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.474
You what?

14:34.507 --> 14:37.410
NTSB already
interviewed him.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.946
We do our own interviews.
Go pick him up again.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.048
All right, I'll check
on the Syrian engineer's

14:41.081 --> 14:42.215
terrorist connections.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.350
You know, just for kicks.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.618
Amita, what do you think?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.387
An accident?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.689
I mean, there's no apparent
equipment or system failures.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.191
But I'm going through
every keystroke

14:51.224 --> 14:52.292
and voice communication
up to the crash.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.195
Now, I'll have more of an
opinion in a few hours.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.702
Medic!

15:02.735 --> 15:04.337
We need a medic
over here!

15:06.406 --> 15:08.375
Got her?
Yeah.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.542
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.411
She's the last one
I could pull out

15:11.444 --> 15:13.713
without destabilizing
the whole pile, though.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.016
Easy.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.553
How're the robots coming?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.389
It's gonna be a little while.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.096
Where... Where's my son?

15:29.129 --> 15:30.230
It's okay, ma'am.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.564
He's probably already been taken
to the hospital, ma'am.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.599
He's okay.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.534
No, no, no!

15:34.567 --> 15:35.702
William was in front of me.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.437
- Your son is William?
- Yes!

15:37.470 --> 15:38.972
He's asthmatic;
I have to get him!

15:39.006 --> 15:40.440
Easy, easy.
You let us take care of that.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.175
You let us take care of it.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.076
Where's my husband?
Ralph Ramirez.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.477
He was driving the train.
Where is he?

15:48.581 --> 15:49.649
I'm sorry.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.985
No!

15:52.019 --> 15:53.686
No! No!

15:53.720 --> 15:55.488
No! William! William!

15:55.522 --> 15:57.390
I have to get
William, please!

15:57.424 --> 15:58.491
Take it easy.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.993
(sobbing):
I have to get William!

16:00.027 --> 16:01.528
- William!
- Shh, shh.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.495
Calm down. Shh.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.639
(indistinct conversations)

16:27.387 --> 16:28.755
(camera whirring)

16:40.367 --> 16:43.070
HazMat found one of the leaks,
but air quality remains the same

16:43.103 --> 16:44.071
at two parts per million.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.773
We'll see if it dissipates
in the next hour.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.675
There's no way of knowing
what's inside the crushed car.

16:48.708 --> 16:52.079
Charlie just inserted
the robots into the pile.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.120
The swarmbots are giving us
an excellent transmission.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.591
It's looking for
heat signatures.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.792
(sighs)

17:09.196 --> 17:11.030
(trilling)

17:16.836 --> 17:18.571
(whispers):
Okay.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.672
We have a fatality.

17:19.706 --> 17:23.443
Yeah, but it looks like
there's a void right here

17:23.476 --> 17:25.112
- we could probably climb into.
- No, no.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.514
The bots are reporting
instability in that quadrant.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.185
I believe the, uh, deceased is

17:32.219 --> 17:33.820
Frannie Driscoll.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.592
Well, she was alive,
generating a heat signal,

17:39.626 --> 17:41.161
just a couple hours ago.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.362
She probably couldn't handle
the methyl isocyanate.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.165
You said the levels weren't
high enough to kill anybody.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.266
CHARLIE: Not enough to kill
a healthy adult,

17:46.299 --> 17:50.437
but the wounded, weakened,
children and the elderly

17:50.470 --> 17:51.838
are much more
vulnerable.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.474
So the boy and the old man
are in trouble.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.875
William is more at risk
to corrosive agents,

17:55.908 --> 17:57.877
because of the smaller diameter
of his airways.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.446
William, it'll be okay.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.680
You're gonna be
all right, okay?

18:00.713 --> 18:01.514
We're coming for you.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.350
She got the boy
on his cell phone.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.817
William, William,
are you there?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.186
I lost him,
I lost him.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.354
I'll get cell phone numbers

18:07.387 --> 18:08.421
for the rest of them.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.223
(keypad beeping)

18:10.257 --> 18:12.592
(trilling)

18:12.625 --> 18:14.427
Did they get
everybody out?

18:14.461 --> 18:15.728
You were the dispatcher.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.198
Why were you in such a rush
to leave the scene?

18:18.231 --> 18:19.499
I got two jobs.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.568
And if I lose this one
'cause of the accident...

18:21.601 --> 18:23.470
Why would you
lose your job?

18:23.503 --> 18:26.173
Somebody's got to take the fall.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.874
Ain't usually the big dogs.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.243
So, if it's me,

18:30.277 --> 18:32.679
I really need
the second job.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.282
I-I got seven kids,
my wife's got Lupus...

18:35.315 --> 18:37.484
Tell me about last night.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
Shift starts
at 4:00.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.488
Nothing unusual.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.890
Around 7:00,
the Desert Pacific Rider

18:43.923 --> 18:47.160
checks in at
mile post 112-9,

18:47.194 --> 18:48.861
and I authorize the switch
at the south yard.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.331
The conductor said that
the switch flag wasn't up.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.867
Maybe it was stuck.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.403
But I doubt it.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.238
'Cause if there's any
mechanical problems,

18:58.271 --> 19:00.773
it shows up on my screen
and the train's computer

19:00.807 --> 19:02.275
and about three
or four backups.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.843
NTSB said
no mechanical failure.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.913
Just check the records.

19:06.946 --> 19:10.817
I activated the switch when
the train was five minutes out.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.385
And it-it worked.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.853
Why would the conductor lie?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.355
Maybe he was
coming in too fast.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.557
Maybe he was doped up.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.260
His tox screen was clean,
like yours.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.628
Maybe it was a bomb.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.696
It was terrorists?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.665
Have you thought about that?

19:28.968 --> 19:31.238
DON:
You think it was a derailment?

19:31.271 --> 19:33.240
You have to get those
passengers out of there.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.542
This crash could be
the end of my business.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.710
Let me ask you something:
You guys run old trains?

19:37.744 --> 19:38.845
No, nothing like that.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.681
Until a couple months ago,
these hazardous chemicals

19:41.714 --> 19:44.317
were transported by
Markovius Trucking.

19:44.351 --> 19:44.984
Whoa.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.486
Roman Markovius?
Yeah.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.854
The mobster;
the king of trucking.

19:47.887 --> 19:48.821
I underbid him.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.723
- What, he threaten you?
- Well, he let me know

19:50.757 --> 19:52.259
he doesn't like losing money.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.361
But he better get used to it--
trucks are history.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.395
He puts me out of business,

19:55.428 --> 19:57.630
someone else is gonna pop up
to take my place.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.407
(trilling)

20:07.440 --> 20:08.241
This room looks promising.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.976
Could you get
another one of your bots

20:10.009 --> 20:11.878
- over there to check it out?
- They've already figured out

20:11.911 --> 20:13.012
that they need to explore
that passage.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.247
It's okay, baby.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.948
It won't be long now, okay?

20:15.982 --> 20:17.350
You try and slow down

20:17.384 --> 20:19.319
your breathing, okay?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.355
There's a leg right there.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.291
It's a child's.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.794
ESTELLA:
William! Oh no, William!

20:27.827 --> 20:28.795
Shh, shh.

20:28.828 --> 20:29.862
WILLIAM (over phone):
Mommy!

20:29.896 --> 20:31.998
Hey, hey, it's okay, buddy.
No, it's all right.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.833
- What's wrong?
- No, buddy, it's okay.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.502
Your m-mom's fine.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.803
She's doing just fine.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.904
All right?

20:37.937 --> 20:38.971
We're about
to suit up,

20:39.005 --> 20:40.273
and we're gonna come in there,

20:40.307 --> 20:41.374
and we're gonna come get you.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.442
All right?

20:42.475 --> 20:43.776
It's gonna be
a cool rescue.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.378
Like "Iron Man."

20:45.412 --> 20:46.846
Now, we're gonna
need your help, too.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.348
Okay, buddy?

20:48.381 --> 20:49.749
What's wrong with my mom?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.250
(labored breathing)

20:53.353 --> 20:55.688
Okay, baby, I'm back.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.590
Okay, you be brave.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.560
Come here a minute.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.861
What's going on?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.463
Man, you got
to be careful.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.765
There's a possibility that
kid's not gonna make it.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.934
You got to brace
yourself for that.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.902
All right?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.711
NIKKI: Word is you don't like
to lose money.

21:18.745 --> 21:19.746
Well, luckily,
that's not happening.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.580
You just lost

21:20.613 --> 21:23.049
a big contract
to Desert Pacific Rail.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.517
In general,
business is good.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.753
Specifically,
I am not incentivized

21:26.786 --> 21:28.388
to sabotage railroads,

21:28.421 --> 21:30.823
as you are no doubt
about to accuse me.

21:30.857 --> 21:31.824
Incenti-what?

21:31.858 --> 21:34.494
I just bought a sizable stake

21:34.527 --> 21:35.795
in rail transport.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.730
It's my business now.

21:37.764 --> 21:38.998
Why would I harm it?

21:39.031 --> 21:40.066
DON:
Well, one reason is

21:40.099 --> 21:41.067
you'd bring prices down.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.802
You could snatch up inventory.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.071
You think like a criminal.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.440
That's how I catch them.

21:47.474 --> 21:51.077
Diversification works better
than breaking kneecaps.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.079
So I diversified.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.648
We didn't touch
Desert Pacific Rail.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.417
Richard Cory

21:57.450 --> 22:00.086
sows the seeds
of his own demise.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.688
Whatever that means.

22:03.155 --> 22:08.595
213-555-0172.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.830
That's Douglas Abbott, 21,
Portland, Oregon.

22:12.732 --> 22:13.900
Douglas...

22:13.933 --> 22:14.967
(weakly): Yeah.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.536
This is Agent Granger of the
FBI.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.070
Great, man. Where you been?
(coughs)

22:18.104 --> 22:19.739
Listen, we're
coming in to get you.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.474
Hey, ask him about the person
next to him.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.575
Okay.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.811
All right, David,
memorize this.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.646
Nine meters straight in,

22:26.679 --> 22:29.516
six meters left 30 degrees,

22:29.549 --> 22:31.718
seven meters right 15 degrees--
you got it?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.720
Got it.
All right.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.422
Susan Lang. She's 19.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.390
Seems to have a broken arm,
but otherwise...

22:37.424 --> 22:39.526
DOUGLAS: This metal...
it's cooled down now.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.694
I think I can push it
out of the way.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.596
CHARLIE: What's he doing?
No, he'll cause a collapse.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.131
No, no, no.
Tell him to stop!

22:45.164 --> 22:46.866
- Tell him not to move.
- Doug, wait a minute.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.501
COLBY:
Doug, don't-don't try to help.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.769
Don't move anything.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.538
No! Doug,
can you hear me?

22:53.172 --> 22:55.107
Doug!

23:00.813 --> 23:02.715
(phone clatters)

23:13.125 --> 23:14.326
DAVID:
We can find ice on Mars,

23:14.360 --> 23:17.497
but we can't get the people
in tangled metal 20 feet away.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.433
You should try
and catch some Z's, David.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.469
We've been going,
like, 40 hours now.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.937
The other case was yesterday--
it feels like a week ago.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.540
Look, uh, did you...
have you talked to, uh,

23:27.574 --> 23:28.941
Doug and Susan's parents
in Oregon?

23:28.975 --> 23:30.076
Did you call them?

23:30.109 --> 23:32.645
We don't legally
know they're dead.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.180
Their heat signatures are gone;
they're dead, okay?

23:34.213 --> 23:35.515
And we know it.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.883
Did you talk
to the parents or not?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.586
They're flying in, David.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.488
Take a break, all right?

23:41.521 --> 23:46.125
Napping is the smartest
thing you can do right now.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.161
Here's what I want to know.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.864
The geniuses, they lost half
of their robots in the collapse.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.065
Right? Now they're
starting over,

23:53.099 --> 23:54.701
and they're mapping us
a way inside.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.003
How long do we wait?

23:57.036 --> 23:59.772
You gotta just chill, man.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.046
Be brave for Mama, okay?.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.148
How's he doing?

24:09.181 --> 24:11.217
Hold on, William--
I'll be right back.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.619
He can't breathe.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.886
It's getting worse.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.888
Try to get him to,
uh, remain calm.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.160
How long are we
supposed to wait on

24:21.193 --> 24:22.929
this Yellow Brick Road of yours?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.864
Dial down
your attitude, man, I...

24:24.897 --> 24:27.534
No. We lost six robots and two
people in that last collapse.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.901
Now, you give me
a firm percentage.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.537
on is hot air?at you're working

24:30.570 --> 24:31.604
Hot air?

24:31.638 --> 24:33.573
50%? 60%? You just tell me.

24:33.606 --> 24:34.974
You want to cause
50 tons of steel

24:35.007 --> 24:36.743
to crush this kid
and crack open a toxic tanker

24:36.776 --> 24:38.645
so that we can all be dead
in the next half hour,

24:38.678 --> 24:39.946
then you be my guest
and dive in there!

24:39.979 --> 24:41.514
You can't guarantee that
it's not gonna happen

24:41.548 --> 24:42.682
when I have a new map!

24:42.715 --> 24:44.551
David, patience-- "patience
achieves more than force."

24:44.584 --> 24:45.785
Edmund Burke, statesman.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.521
"You take patience too far,
and then you have cowardice."

24:48.555 --> 24:50.222
George Jackson,
Black Panther.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.258
I have reprogrammed
this bot to locate

24:52.291 --> 24:54.594
William's cell phone-- it should
find the most efficient route.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.062
For a six-inch Tinker Toy.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.867
I need...
I need to get in there.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.770
I need you to find a space
that I can fit in.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.906
That's what the other bots are
working on, okay? Listen.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.841
Listen-- William's low
body weight makes him

25:08.875 --> 25:10.977
more susceptible to
those toxins, all right?

25:11.010 --> 25:13.713
- So, yeah, he's...
- He's dying.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.114
He's dying.
Yeah, I know that.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.082
And if he gets
this inhaler,

25:16.115 --> 25:18.785
then it'll buy us more
time to get to him.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.920
(quietly):
All right.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.722
All right.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.936
AMITA: I can't find what caused
the derailment.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.005
I mean, the switch happened
four minutes before the crash.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.106
How do you know that?

25:40.139 --> 25:41.941
Because it's recorded here in
the computer output.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.676
Yeah, but what's recorded?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.344
The time of the dispatcher
hitting the button

25:45.377 --> 25:48.347
or the actual switching
of the iron pieces?

25:48.380 --> 25:51.083
That's a good question.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.319
AMITA:
The switching sequence requires

25:53.352 --> 25:54.754
two actions
from the dispatcher.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.255
He entered the first command

25:56.288 --> 25:58.090
at 7:01, before the crash.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.292
Then nothing
for three and a half minutes.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.161
Derailment occurred at 7:04.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.997
The second command switch
was entered seven seconds later,

26:05.031 --> 26:06.365
after the crash.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.233
NIKKI:
NTSB said that

26:07.266 --> 26:09.301
the switch happened
on time at 7:01.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.170
AMITA: Think of it as a plane

26:11.203 --> 26:12.404
that's scheduled to depart
at 7:00.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.107
If it leaves the gate at 7:00,
then taxis across the tarmac

26:15.141 --> 26:17.910
and actually takes off at 7:04,
the public record has it down

26:17.944 --> 26:19.612
as an on-time departure at 7:00.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.748
The time of the first
command is often recorded

26:21.781 --> 26:23.182
as the time of completion,
usually because

26:23.215 --> 26:24.651
it's just
a few seconds difference.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.019
DON: He starts the sequence, but
he doesn't finish.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.354
NIKKI:
And then, after derailment,

26:28.387 --> 26:31.190
he finishes it on the computer,
even though the actual

26:31.223 --> 26:32.391
physical switch
had already been destroyed.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.661
But it's all recorded as if it
happened before the crash.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.362
DON: And we're
absolutely sure

26:36.395 --> 26:38.631
the command came from the
dispatcher's computer, right?

26:38.665 --> 26:40.099
Not, like, a hacker...

26:40.132 --> 26:42.168
electronic fingerprint.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.936
All right, good. Let me know if
you get anywhere with that.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.337
And Markovius was telling
the truth

26:45.371 --> 26:46.973
about buying a stake
in the rail business.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.240
The Organized Crime
Task Force says

26:48.274 --> 26:49.909
he doesn't need
to play dirty, you know?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.410
He makes his money
inside the system

26:51.443 --> 26:52.544
just like any other
greedy businessman.

26:52.578 --> 26:55.281
Right, like Richard Cory--
I mean, that guy bugs me.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.684
I'll put him under the
microscope, see what I find.

26:57.717 --> 26:57.750
Let's get that dispatcher
back in here, all right?

26:59.251 --> 27:00.920
All right.

27:04.423 --> 27:05.725
Mr. Malin, hey.

27:05.758 --> 27:06.859
(snaps fingers)
Come on, wake up.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.628
(exhales)

27:10.730 --> 27:12.732
Anyone visit you

27:12.765 --> 27:14.667
at work last night?

27:14.701 --> 27:15.802
Hmm? No.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.303
- No?
- Oh, wait a minute.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.739
I'm not sure.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.073
What night is it now?

27:21.107 --> 27:22.374
What's today's date?

27:22.408 --> 27:24.777
Last night was
the night of the crash.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.412
Did anyone visit you?

27:26.445 --> 27:28.147
No.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.082
We have logs.
You could check 'em.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.819
No one paid you
to look the other way

27:32.852 --> 27:35.688
while they got
on your computer?

27:35.722 --> 27:37.690
Are you crazy?

27:37.724 --> 27:39.658
I would never do that.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.201
You fell asleep.

27:49.235 --> 27:51.738
Look at you, you can't
even keep your eyes open.

27:51.771 --> 27:52.839
That's what
happened, isn't it?

27:52.872 --> 27:54.707
You fell asleep while you
were making the switch.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.776
- No. Why are you...
- The alarms went off,

27:56.809 --> 27:58.177
and you woke up,
and then you finished it.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.246
I made the switch.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.914
Mr. Malin, that switch
was made after the crash.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.750
This is a fact; we know it.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.127
My wife is sick.

28:15.161 --> 28:19.198
So I got to take care
of the kids between my jobs.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.434
I haven't slept...

28:22.468 --> 28:24.937
in about a week.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.840
Last night, I...

28:27.874 --> 28:33.312
I had trouble
focusing my eyes, so...

28:33.345 --> 28:36.448
I thought
I finished the switch,

28:36.482 --> 28:38.885
and...
I went into the bathroom

28:38.918 --> 28:42.221
to put some cold water
on my face.

28:42.254 --> 28:45.257
It used to be that
there were two of us

28:45.291 --> 28:46.926
who worked the same shift,

28:46.959 --> 28:48.895
but...

28:48.928 --> 28:51.931
the company
made cutbacks.

28:53.365 --> 28:56.268
When I came back in the room...

28:56.302 --> 28:59.105
the alarms were going off,

28:59.138 --> 29:01.841
and...

29:01.874 --> 29:04.811
like you said, I just...

29:08.414 --> 29:10.549
I didn't mean to.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.786
(crying):
I'm sorry.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.356
I am so sorry.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.325
(crying quietly)

29:23.229 --> 29:25.965
CHARLIE:
The little bot who could.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.399
Okay, William,
listen up, buddy.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.500
We have this little robot

29:28.534 --> 29:31.503
that's gonna make its way
over to you, all right?

29:31.537 --> 29:33.172
It's gonna bring you
some medicine,

29:33.205 --> 29:36.008
it's gonna help you
with your breathing, okay?

29:36.042 --> 29:37.443
(weakly):
Okay.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.946
I'm... thirsty.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.547
DAVID:
I know, I know.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.015
You're doing a great job, buddy.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.984
Can you put Mr. Knight
on the phone?

29:45.017 --> 29:46.052
Can you do that?

29:46.085 --> 29:47.319
CHARLIE:
Three more meters.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.522
This map will be complete
in a half hour,

29:50.556 --> 29:52.859
if William can just hold on.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.833
CHARLIE:
No, no, no.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.902
What? What?
What happened?

30:02.935 --> 30:05.504
Hold on. Hold on,
Mr. Knight, hold on.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.538
It can't cross.
Why?

30:06.572 --> 30:09.375
Because this bot has
to link to the other bots

30:09.408 --> 30:11.844
in order to cross an opening
over ten inches wide.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.317
Listen, now, we're gonna need
you to help us out here.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.619
Okay? We need you to keep
William breathing slowly.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.321
KNIGHT:
I can do that.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.323
All right.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.200
You think I-I... you think
I'm holding something back?

30:34.233 --> 30:35.467
David, we're close.

30:35.501 --> 30:36.969
You've been saying that
all night!

30:37.003 --> 30:38.504
David, please.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.472
No more waiting, Charlie.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.541
Okay? No more waiting.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.310
Now, come on. David.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.145
No.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.981
David!

30:49.015 --> 30:50.349
(frustrated grunt)

30:50.382 --> 30:53.452
(filtered breathing)

30:56.055 --> 30:57.924
David's gone into the pile
without the map.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.025
Where is he?

30:59.058 --> 31:00.292
I don't know.

31:03.329 --> 31:04.997
Um...

31:05.031 --> 31:06.565
Come on, come on.
Okay, that's him.

31:06.598 --> 31:07.533
All right, he's
on track so far.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.535
He's been studying that
map for the last hour.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.337
- David, can you hear me?
- He can hear you.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.306
COLBY: All right, buddy, stay
cool-- you're doing great.

31:16.242 --> 31:19.478
(filtered breathing)

31:34.260 --> 31:36.228
That's a hot zone.
It's a hot zone.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.564
What does that mean?
Is it toxic?

31:38.597 --> 31:39.665
No, but there's fire
under that section.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.233
That metal's really hot--
tell him to stay right.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.269
All right, David,
you got to stay right.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.004
Stay to the right, David.
To the right.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.309
David...

31:50.342 --> 31:51.643
(metal creaking)

31:51.677 --> 31:54.113
(loud clattering)

31:55.982 --> 31:57.984
David?

32:00.486 --> 32:01.920
David!

32:10.329 --> 32:13.699
David, can you hear me?
David!

32:18.237 --> 32:19.205
DON: What the hell happened?

32:19.238 --> 32:20.539
He went in for the rescue

32:20.572 --> 32:22.274
before the route was clear;
he's not answering.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.010
Charlie, is he...?

32:24.043 --> 32:25.011
No, his heat signatures
are strong.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.245
He's alive, but the collapse

32:26.278 --> 32:27.746
increased the flow of toxic gas.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.082
How do we get him out?
You got any ideas?

32:30.116 --> 32:32.484
Well, have a map of the pile
before the crash.

32:32.518 --> 32:33.385
We know where he went wrong.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.487
- What about the robots?
- I lost them all.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.256
But look, whatever fell
on David didn't kill him,

32:37.289 --> 32:39.258
so I estimated a range
for that weight

32:39.291 --> 32:40.993
and did a progressive
collapse analysis-- here.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.161
Which tells us...?

32:42.194 --> 32:43.662
Which pieces of the pick-up
sticks to remove to avoid

32:43.695 --> 32:44.630
another collapse.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.432
All right, well, tell us
where to make a hole.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.300
I'll go in on a cable
and I'll pull him out.

32:50.336 --> 32:53.305
(On radio): Stand by. We've got
a visual on Agent Granger.

32:53.339 --> 32:56.308
MAN 2:
We're standing by as well.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.411
MAN 3 (distant):
Steady...

32:59.445 --> 33:01.713
MAN 4 (over radio):
Go ahead. I, uh, I see them.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.016
They're lowering him down now.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.255
Okay, stop.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.264
All right, guys, down easy;
let me down easy.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.732
Careful, careful.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.035
(indistinct
radio communication)

33:26.338 --> 33:28.006
(loud crash)

33:39.285 --> 33:40.319
COLBY:
David?

33:45.257 --> 33:48.260
David, can you hear me? David?

33:48.294 --> 33:49.761
(beeping)

33:49.795 --> 33:52.531
William, can you hear me?

33:52.564 --> 33:54.300
(debris rumbling,
clattering)

33:54.333 --> 33:58.270
Mr. Knight? Jeffrey Knight?!

33:58.304 --> 33:59.238
(weakly):
Yes.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.407
Can you reach me?

34:01.440 --> 34:03.242
I'm trying.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.359
(clattering)

34:36.375 --> 34:38.310
All right, Charlie,
where is he?

34:38.344 --> 34:40.446
He's crawling
toward William, Colby.

34:40.479 --> 34:41.480
You're not far enough in.

34:41.513 --> 34:42.581
All right, got ya.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.325
I'm at a dead end, guys.

34:53.359 --> 34:54.460
No, that can't be.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.495
You must've taken
a wrong turn.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.564
Well, I did exactly
what you said.

34:58.597 --> 35:03.369
Nine straight in,
six left 30 degrees.

35:03.402 --> 35:06.372
Seven right 15 degrees.

35:06.405 --> 35:09.275
Colby, are you counting
in meters?

35:11.477 --> 35:12.811
That's the problem.
I'm counting in yards.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.313
I'll go back and do it right.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.414
Well, you don't have to go back
to the beginning.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.782
Just go to the first juncture

35:16.815 --> 35:18.650
and add 3.28 feet.

35:18.684 --> 35:21.453
Yeah, give or take .28 feet,
got it.

35:21.487 --> 35:24.323
- And then recount from there.
- Will do.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.162
I should have
double-checked that.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.663
It's all right.
It's all right.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.199
Everyone's exhausted.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.367
(on radio):
All right, I see him.

35:35.401 --> 35:36.635
David.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.738
Thank you, God. Thank you.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.474
David...

35:42.508 --> 35:45.177
What took you
so long, man?

35:45.211 --> 35:47.679
I don't know how
to get out of here.

35:47.713 --> 35:51.917
Don't worry.
I left us bread crumbs.

35:51.950 --> 35:54.886
We need to keep this mask
on his face.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.290
I brought an inhaler.

36:00.359 --> 36:01.960
I want you to breathe into that,
okay?

36:01.993 --> 36:04.330
(wheezing breath)

36:04.363 --> 36:07.599
(indistinct
radio communication)

36:07.633 --> 36:09.201
(beeping)

36:10.769 --> 36:13.372
(deep rumbling)

36:13.405 --> 36:15.474
(rumbling stops,
Colby gasping)

36:15.507 --> 36:16.342
Yeah.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.477
Why don't you ease him
on over here?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.512
(William wheezing weakly)

36:20.546 --> 36:22.548
(grunting)

36:28.520 --> 36:31.390
(rumbling, clattering)

36:34.360 --> 36:35.427
Okay.
All right.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.296
Here.

36:37.329 --> 36:40.799
Okay, Mr. Knight,
it's your turn, sir.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.768
I'm gonna hand
you this mask.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.371
I want you to put it
on your face, okay?

36:45.404 --> 36:46.238
Thank you. Thank you.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.574
All right, guys,
we're coming out, okay?

36:48.607 --> 36:50.542
Okay, good job.
You do that.

36:50.576 --> 36:54.480
See you guys
on the outside.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.983
(On radio): He's ready to come
out. I think he's got the boy.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.760
Set him down.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.796
All right, he's down.

37:10.829 --> 37:11.863
There.
You've got him.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.031
Easy now.
Unhook him.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.766
Got it.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.968
Oh, God, is he okay?
Oh, honey!

37:19.305 --> 37:20.539
Is he okay?

37:23.909 --> 37:26.878
Send that cable back over here,
will ya?!

37:26.912 --> 37:29.281
All right, David, it's coming
back at ya, buddy.

37:29.315 --> 37:31.517
Hang in there, man,
it's coming.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.452
I don't know how.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.454
Thank you.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.323
Made it, Mr. Knight.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.458
We made it.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.460
I'm gonna lift
you up, all right?

37:41.493 --> 37:43.929
All right, come on.
Easy.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.465
COLBY:
Okay, they're on their way out.

37:54.406 --> 37:55.374
(tires screeching)

37:55.407 --> 37:56.775
(crashing)

37:56.808 --> 37:59.645
Charlie, listen.
Hmm?

37:59.678 --> 38:03.048
Hey, look, go home.
Go get some rest, man.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.450
It's okay.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.721
No... I gotta...
No, I know what happened.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.657
Hey, I know what happened.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.359
Just let me see
those train records.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.593
I'll be able to prove it.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.061
Whoa, whoa, prove what?

38:16.094 --> 38:20.532
Listen, even if that switch
wasn't in the correct position,

38:20.566 --> 38:22.668
that train should have come
to a stop

38:22.701 --> 38:23.635
based on its weight and speed.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.837
Actually, that's what
the conductor said.

38:25.871 --> 38:26.972
Mm-hmm.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.206
He runs his train with math.

38:28.239 --> 38:31.877
Mass and velocity determine
the distance required to stop,

38:31.910 --> 38:33.945
so he must have
had the wrong weight.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.347
That train

38:35.381 --> 38:37.816
was heavier
than that conductor thought,

38:37.849 --> 38:40.552
making his calculations
for stopping incorrect.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.488
Well, that I can check.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.956
You did great.

38:44.990 --> 38:45.957
Easy.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.626
(sighs)

38:47.659 --> 38:48.794
COLBY:
Hey, man, great job.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.697
Yeah, yeah.
Killed my bots, man.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.465
Yeah, well, they all
deserve Purple Hearts.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.501
Put little badges
on the next ones.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.002
Yeah, armor 'em
a little better.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.670
Yeah.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.572
You did great, Mr. Knight.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.574
MAN: You're gonna be just fine,
sir. You did great.

39:05.711 --> 39:06.878
Hold on. All right.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.780
Ease off.

39:08.814 --> 39:12.584
Sorry about that, Charlie.
I had to do it.

39:12.618 --> 39:13.652
It's no sweat.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.521
I was about to go in there
myself.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.893
Agents, thanks
for your efforts.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.161
Get your hands
behind your back.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.430
You're under arrest.

39:24.463 --> 39:25.597
For what?

39:25.631 --> 39:27.633
Lying about the cargo tonnage
in order to save money,

39:27.666 --> 39:28.767
so you could
undercut bids.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.569
Sending out 12,000 tons.

39:30.602 --> 39:31.470
Listed only 10,000.

39:31.503 --> 39:32.971
Who'd you bribe
for that, by the way?

39:33.004 --> 39:34.473
Maybe there was an error.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.608
Yeah, like, how many times
you got away with it.

39:36.642 --> 39:37.476
Do you know what?

39:37.509 --> 39:39.077
We're gonna find out
all about that.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.746
If you'd have played
by the rules--

39:40.779 --> 39:42.614
yeah, there would have been
a switching error--

39:42.648 --> 39:44.583
but that train would have
stopped in time.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.552
None of this
would've even happened.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.620
Tell me
that you've never cut corners

39:48.654 --> 39:50.422
to get the job done.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.090
Watch your head.
(thud, groan)

39:53.792 --> 39:55.160
(sighs)

39:58.063 --> 39:59.798
I don't want you doing stuff
like that, okay?

39:59.831 --> 40:01.667
I want you being better than me.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.736
You did all right today.

40:04.770 --> 40:09.641
* One thing I'll say
for the less traveled way *

40:09.675 --> 40:11.610
(sighs heavily)

40:11.643 --> 40:14.480
Hey, man, wake up, I'll
give you a ride home.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.715
Yeah... uh, yeah.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.885
* Has twice the gravity

40:19.918 --> 40:22.153
(snoring loudly)

40:22.187 --> 40:29.861
* Get in and go
and you're one with the now *

40:29.895 --> 40:33.131
* Turns inconsistently

40:34.833 --> 40:41.106
* Arcs in a symphony

40:41.139 --> 40:46.878
* Make your mind sharp
and aware of the holes *

40:46.912 --> 40:51.717
* Fall through them steadily

40:51.750 --> 40:56.922
* Slip through them readily

40:59.024 --> 41:04.763
* One thing I'll say
for the less traveled way *

41:06.698 --> 41:09.868
* Doesn't have subtlety

41:11.169 --> 41:14.940
* Has twice the gravity.
