20:45.077 --> 20:46.813
SURE I DO.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.519
IT ISN'T THE FOLLIES,

20:52.619 --> 20:54.954
BUT THEN THIS AIN'T
HARDLY MANHATTAN NEITHER.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.358
YOU SEEN
THE HAWKINS BOY ?

20:58.458 --> 21:01.127
HE LIT OUT IN THE CHEVY
THIS MORNIN'.

21:01.227 --> 21:04.297
WHERE TO ?

21:07.166 --> 21:09.802
COME OVER HERE,
LITTLE LADY.

21:19.145 --> 21:23.516
( screaming )

21:56.015 --> 21:57.984
( clearing throat )

22:10.397 --> 22:11.964
NOW THEN...

22:12.064 --> 22:16.335
MISTER...

22:21.474 --> 22:24.110
MISTER DOE.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.978
MIND IF I
CALL YOU JOHN ?

22:26.078 --> 22:28.515
APPARENTLY, YOU JUMPED--

22:28.615 --> 22:33.019
NO, YOU THREATENED TO JUMP OFF
THE JOHN F. CHELLIS BRIDGE.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.992
NOPE,
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ?

22:41.394 --> 22:43.329
I REMEMBER...

22:43.430 --> 22:46.766
I REMEMBER PERFECTLY.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.839
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
WHAT I AM.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.574
AND THAT IS... ?

22:54.674 --> 22:59.446
THE LEFT HAND OF GOD.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.649
I SEE, LEFT...

23:02.749 --> 23:05.217
AND WHAT, EXACTLY, DOES IT MEAN
TO BE THE "LEFT HAND OF GOD ?"

23:05.317 --> 23:07.887
IT MEANS THAT I'M
NO LONGER HIS SERVANT.

23:07.987 --> 23:11.257
AND I NEVER WAS.

23:11.357 --> 23:15.828
I AM HIS WILL
MADE FLESH.

23:15.928 --> 23:19.331
LIKE JESUS ?

23:19.432 --> 23:21.267
( chuckling )

23:21.367 --> 23:23.870
NO.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.041
SATAN ?

23:29.141 --> 23:33.680
NO.

23:41.788 --> 23:44.457
YOU'VE MISSPELLED
"EXCITATION."

23:44.557 --> 23:48.628
I BEG YOUR PARDON ?

23:53.332 --> 23:58.705
YOU ASKED ME WHAT IT MEANT
TO BE THE "LEFT HAND OF GOD".

24:00.507 --> 24:02.408
I TOLD YOU...

24:02.509 --> 24:05.344
I BROKE A MAN'S NECK.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.447
AH...

24:08.548 --> 24:12.184
YOU NEVER SAID...

24:12.284 --> 24:14.554
YOU BROKE A MAN'S NECK.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.223
I WILLED IT,
AND IT WAS SO.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.992
FASCINATING.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.994
YES.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.463
AND TERRIBLE AND...

24:32.772 --> 24:35.508
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY THAT ON ME ?

24:35.608 --> 24:40.980
PERHAPS
I ALREADY HAVE.

24:46.318 --> 24:50.256
THE TREATMENTS
THAT YOU RECEIVED

24:50.356 --> 24:52.391
WERE NOT INTENDED
TO BE PUNITIVE.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.427
THE PAIN IS AN
UNAVOIDABLE SIDE-EFFECT.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.697
YES, QUITE RIGHT.

24:57.797 --> 25:02.635
"PAIN IS AN UNAVOIDABLE
SIDE-EFFECT..."

25:04.436 --> 25:06.138
MMM...

25:15.147 --> 25:19.418
MIGHT IT BE POSSIBLE
FOR ME TO GET SOME PAPER

25:19.518 --> 25:21.754
AND SOMETHING
TO WRITE WITH ?

25:21.854 --> 25:23.823
A FOUNTAIN-PEN PERHAPS.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.092
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.228
NO MATTER.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.263
( knocking )

25:31.363 --> 25:33.833
I DON'T THINK
IT WILL BE NECESSARY.

25:39.505 --> 25:42.141
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

25:53.119 --> 25:56.255
( distant screams )

26:41.600 --> 26:43.903
( stuttering )
FA-F-FILL HER UP ?

26:44.003 --> 26:48.440
I'M LOOKIN' FOR
A TOWN CALLED GUNDERSON.

26:48.540 --> 26:53.880
G-GUNDERSON ?

26:53.980 --> 26:56.215
YEAH.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.151
WELL, HMM...

26:59.251 --> 27:04.223
THERE'S GUNDERVILLE.

27:04.323 --> 27:08.327

G-GUNDER IN IT.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.029
WHERE'S IT AT ?

27:11.163 --> 27:13.032
THERE'S A FELLA
LIVES UP HERE.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.703
CALLS HIMSELF
THE SCORPION BOY.

27:16.803 --> 27:20.506
SCORPION BOY ?

27:20.606 --> 27:21.841
YEAH, CLAWS.

27:21.941 --> 27:25.177
HE'S GOT CLAWS
INSTEAD OF HANDS.

27:26.445 --> 27:31.483
NO, NO, SCORPION B-BOYS.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.386
NOT AROUND HERE.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.788
YEAH.

27:35.888 --> 27:44.230
B-B-BUT GOT US A,
UM, LOBSTER GAL.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.198
SHE G-GOT CLAWS...

27:46.298 --> 27:48.768
WHERE'S SHE AT ?

27:48.868 --> 27:52.939

RUN ON DOWN ABOUT

27:53.039 --> 27:55.808
15, 20 MILE

27:55.908 --> 27:58.911
AND THEN YOU HOOK
AROUND TO L-LANE.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.613
ANOTHER MILE OR SO
THERE'S AN OLD PLACE,

28:01.714 --> 28:03.015
THE TUCKER PLACE.

28:03.115 --> 28:07.219
THAT'S WHERE
THE LOBSTER-GAL RESIDES.

28:07.319 --> 28:11.958
THANK YOU.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.481
YOU'RE PRETTY LIGHT UP
ON YOUR FEET THERE, MISSY.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.216
MA.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.751
SHE IS.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.920
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
HOW TO DANCE ?

28:41.020 --> 28:43.522
I DON'T KNOW,
IT JUST SORTA--

28:43.622 --> 28:45.191
COMES NATURAL ?

28:45.291 --> 28:50.830
LIBBY BABY, GO GET MAMA
ONE OF THEM KNEE-HIGHS.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.966
SCOOT.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.411
I WANNA THANK YOU.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.179
WHAT FOR ?

29:07.279 --> 29:10.182
IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE
I SEEN MY BABY SMILIN'

29:10.282 --> 29:13.652
AND HAVIN' ALL THAT FUN
UP ON THE STAGE.

29:13.752 --> 29:18.057
I WAS AFRAID BABYLON
TOOK THAT AWAY FROM HER.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.566
HEY, I GOT
AN IDEA !

29:27.666 --> 29:29.135
WHAT ?

29:29.235 --> 29:30.769
WHY DON'T YOU
WORK THE BALLY ?

29:30.870 --> 29:34.040
I REALLY COULDN'T--

29:34.140 --> 29:36.042
DON'T BE JUMPIN'
TO CONCLUSIONS.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.977
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO STRIP OR NOTHIN'.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.012
YOU JUST GOTTA
GET UP THERE

29:40.112 --> 29:42.314
LOOKIN' ALL COY WHILE
FELIX TURNS THE TIP.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.350
GET THE RUBES ALL PERCOLATED
FOR THE REAL SHOW.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.019
YOU AND LIB WOULD HAVE
A LOT OF FUN UP THERE.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.754
I CAN'T.

29:48.855 --> 29:53.860
I GOT A JOB, SO...

29:57.096 --> 30:00.933
BESIDES, I THINK MAMA
WOULD PROBABLY BLOW A GASKET.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.835
YOU KNOW SOMETHIN' ?

30:02.935 --> 30:05.237
MY MAMA FELT
THE EXACT SAME WAY.

30:05.337 --> 30:08.474
WHICH IS WHY I GOT
INTO THIS BUSINESS.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.879
MA.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.081
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ?

30:17.984 --> 30:20.552
I'M GONNA GO.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.860
COME BY LATER ?

30:29.128 --> 30:32.264
BE SURE AND TELL
YOUR MAMA HI FOR ME.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.203
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW HER MAMA.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.238
WHAT'S TO KNOW ?

30:39.338 --> 30:40.572
SHE'S A STIFF.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.074
I'M JUST BEIN' POLITE.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.610
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TRIED
TO PUT THE HUSTLE ON HER.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.645
HUSTLE ?

30:46.745 --> 30:47.779
OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.516
YOU KNOW EXACTLY--

30:50.616 --> 30:52.184
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.921
SHE'S NOT SOME DUMB NELLY YOU
CAN JUST GRIND INTO THE SHOW.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.688
SHE'S GOT CLASS.

30:56.788 --> 31:01.427
I AM JUST TRYIN'
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.004
WHY HAWKINS ?

31:12.104 --> 31:13.672
CAN YOU TELL ME THAT ?

31:13.772 --> 31:15.241
IT'S A DELICATE
SITUATION, LODZ.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.676
HE'S THE ONLY ONE AROUND WHO
KNOWS HOW TO KEEP HIS TRAP SHUT,

31:17.776 --> 31:20.712
UNLIKE SOME
PEOPLE I KNOW.

31:20.812 --> 31:23.015
SAMSON,
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.884
THE BOY IS A PRISON ESCAPEE,
A FUGITIVE !

31:25.985 --> 31:28.955
AND YET YOU THINK
NOTHING OF GIVING HIM

31:29.055 --> 31:31.590
15 DOLLARS CASH
PLUS A CAR.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.592
YEAH.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.928
DOESN'T THAT
STRIKE YOU AS...

31:36.028 --> 31:39.298
IMPRUDENT ?

31:39.398 --> 31:40.899
HELL, LODZ.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.402
HALF THE GUYS IN
THIS PLACE ARE JAILBIRDS.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.504
I SEND 'EM OUT
ON RUNS ALL THE TIME,

31:45.604 --> 31:47.439
THEY ALWAYS COME BACK.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.808
MOSTLY ALWAYS.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.510
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T
COME BACK ?

31:51.610 --> 31:54.046
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

31:54.146 --> 31:57.984
I THINK YOU'VE MADE A VERY,
VERY LARGE MISTAKE, MY FRIEND.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.485
MISTAKE,
WHAT MISTAKE ?

31:59.585 --> 32:02.354
YOU YOURSELF SAID
THE KID IS A BUMPKIN.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.922
HE'S NOT JUST--

32:04.023 --> 32:05.857
HE'S NOT JUST
A BUMPKIN.

32:05.958 --> 32:08.260
WHY DON'T
YOU TELL ME.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.728
WHAT IS HE ?

32:09.828 --> 32:13.332
EXACTLY.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.042
IS THIS WHERE
THE LOBSTER-GAL LIVES ?

34:04.143 --> 34:07.279
YOU WITH
THE FREAK-SH ?

34:07.379 --> 34:10.082
YEAH.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.457
WELL, HELLO
YOUNG BUCK !

34:51.557 --> 34:54.092
WHAT KEPT YA ?

35:04.370 --> 35:06.638
MOTHER, WE DON'T NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.840
I TOLD HER NO.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.144
WHY ARE YOU NAGGING ME FOR
SOMETHING I HAVEN'T EVEN DONE ?

35:12.244 --> 35:16.081
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAYBE I WOULD.

35:16.182 --> 35:18.684
AT LEAST LIBBY'S MOTHER
TREATS HER DAUGHTER

35:18.784 --> 35:20.852
WITH A LITTLE RESPECT.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.922
YOU'RE ONE
TO TALK, MOTHER.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.558
AT LEAST SHE KNOWS
WHO HER FATHER IS--

35:26.658 --> 35:27.426
( slapping sounds )

35:35.701 --> 35:37.569
CLAYTON JONES...

35:37.669 --> 35:38.670
YEP.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.240
JONESY ?

35:41.340 --> 35:43.842
OH YEAH,
I FIGURED HE'S--

35:43.942 --> 35:45.877
I DON'T ROLL
WITH TRADE.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.479
I KNOW, BUT--

35:47.579 --> 35:49.348
BUT NOTHIN',
THAT IS THE WAY IT IS.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.283
NO TRICKS
WITH CARNY-FOLK.

35:51.383 --> 35:54.886
C'MON, BABY, IT'S NOT LIKE
THIS IS HARD AND FAST--

35:54.986 --> 35:58.824
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS ?

35:58.924 --> 36:04.162
UH, UH, JONESY,
OUT THERE...

36:04.263 --> 36:06.265
HE UH...

36:06.365 --> 36:08.534
WHAT DO YA MEAN ?

36:08.634 --> 36:11.002
WHOSE IDEA,
YOU OR JONES ?

36:11.102 --> 36:12.671
IT WAS HIS.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.640
HELL, I WOULDN'T OF
SET THIS UP INDEPENDENT.

36:14.740 --> 36:18.244
THE POOR SAP,
HE PRACTICALLY BEGGED ME.

36:18.344 --> 36:21.046
IS THAT SO ?

36:21.146 --> 36:22.248
YES, MA'AM.

36:22.348 --> 36:25.651
YOU'RE LYIN' TO ME.

36:25.751 --> 36:28.887
THIS WAS YOUR DOIN'.

36:32.958 --> 36:36.328
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO US ?

36:36.428 --> 36:39.097
I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.132
IT'S JUST ANOTHER
GODDAMN TRICK.

36:41.233 --> 36:44.303
FINE, LINE HIM UP.

36:58.984 --> 36:59.585
RITA--

36:59.685 --> 37:01.687
I SAID FINE.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.138
WHY, HI YA, SOFIE.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.509
( shouting )

37:23.609 --> 37:26.978
( music )

38:09.254 --> 38:10.822
( male on radio )
Good afternoon, friends.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.892
This is Tommy Dolan with
more true tales from the road,

38:13.992 --> 38:16.962
and unless you've been
visiting Mars lately,

38:17.062 --> 38:20.566
you've probably been following
the story of Brother Justin,

38:20.666 --> 38:23.569
originally recounted
by this reporter.

38:23.669 --> 38:27.673
Up and down the Golden State,
one burning question

38:27.773 --> 38:30.409
has crossed the lips of men,
women and children alike,

38:30.509 --> 38:33.412
white, black, brown
and yellow...

38:33.512 --> 38:36.948
( shouting )
BE STILL.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.817
A question that has been
scrawled on water-towers,

38:38.917 --> 38:41.853
boxcars and bridge abutments
from Crescent city to Calexico,

38:41.953 --> 38:44.222
a question that has
become a rallying cry

38:44.322 --> 38:46.224
for the disenfranchised.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.928
Where are you,
Brother Justin ?

39:03.742 --> 39:07.045
WATCH OUT FOR
THE UPHOLSTERY, DARLIN'.

39:11.717 --> 39:15.020
HEY, NO HARD FEELINGS,
I HOPE.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.413
HAVE YOURSELF
A GOO GOO, BOY.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.715
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

39:43.815 --> 39:46.017
HELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET ALL SORE ABOUT IT.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.620
YOU KNOW, US FREAK-FINDERS
GOTTA STICK TOGETHER.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.722
SO, YOU'RE WITH
SAMSON'S OUTFIT.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.758
YOU KNOW, HIM AND ME
GO WAY BACK.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.860
PHINEAS BOFFO.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.429
HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A SOURPUSS ABOUT IT.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.130
PUT HER THERE, KID.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.074
( glass shattering )

40:09.174 --> 40:11.142
( screaming )

40:11.242 --> 40:13.144
JESUS, LET ME GO !

40:13.244 --> 40:16.414
WHAT IS THIS ?

40:16.515 --> 40:18.149
HELLS BELLS, KID.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.018
IT'S MY LODGE-RING.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.620
YOU KNOW, THE CRAFT.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.155
GIMME MY RING
BACK GODDAMNIT.

40:27.292 --> 40:28.560
GODDAMN THIEF !

40:28.660 --> 40:31.062
COME BACK
WITH MY RING !

40:50.949 --> 40:53.318
