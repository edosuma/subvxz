09:52.024 --> 09:54.760
FOR WEARING FLAG SHIRTS,

09:54.827 --> 09:55.227
AMERICAN FLAG SHIRTS.

09:55.294 --> 09:59.732
NOW YOU SEE AMERICAN FLAG DECALS

09:59.799 --> 10:00.766
ON EVERYTHING.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.702
PEOPLE MAKE UNDERWEAR OUT OF IT,

10:02.768 --> 10:04.203
TOILET PAPER OUT OF IT.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.271
BUT IN THE '60s THEY

10:05.338 --> 10:07.340
PROSECUTED PEOPLE.

10:07.406 --> 10:08.774
>> Bill: YOU WERE AHEAD OF

10:08.841 --> 10:10.609
THIS ORGANIZATION FOR 25 YEARS

10:10.676 --> 10:10.843
ALMOST.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.613
FROM 1978 INTO THIS CENTURY.

10:14.680 --> 10:14.947
IT'S CHANGING.

10:15.014 --> 10:18.317
I MEAN, IT WAS A STALWART

10:18.384 --> 10:20.353
DEFENDER OF FREE SPEECH AND

10:20.419 --> 10:22.188
CIVIL LIBERTIES.

10:22.254 --> 10:22.955
IS IT STILL THAT?

10:23.022 --> 10:25.558
>> NOT AS MUCH.

10:25.624 --> 10:26.525
I MEAN, THEY JUST PRODUCED A

10:26.592 --> 10:29.729
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO NEW

10:29.795 --> 10:32.465
GUIDELINES FOR THEIR LAWYERS TO

10:32.531 --> 10:34.000
USE WHEN DECIDING WHAT

10:34.066 --> 10:36.035
FREE SPEECH CASES TO TAKE.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.370
THIS IS A REQUIREMENT NOW FOR

10:37.436 --> 10:40.272
THE NATIONAL ACLU LAWYERS.

10:40.339 --> 10:41.774
BEFORE THEY TAKE THE CASE OF

10:41.841 --> 10:42.575
DEFENDING SOMEONE'S FREE SPEECH

10:42.641 --> 10:44.677
THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

10:44.744 --> 10:49.181
SPEECH DOESN'T OFFEND OR

10:49.248 --> 10:52.051
THREATEN OTHER CIVIL LIBERTIES

10:52.118 --> 10:52.284
VALUES.

10:52.351 --> 10:55.321
IN OTHER WORDS, BEFORE THEY ARE

10:55.388 --> 10:56.555
GOING TO DEFEND YOUR FREE SPEECH

10:56.622 --> 10:59.825
THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU SAY.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.594
THAT IS THE ACLU?

11:01.660 --> 11:03.763
NO, THAT IS THE GOVERNMENT!

11:03.829 --> 11:04.764
WHAT IS THE ACLU DOING?

11:04.830 --> 11:08.167
>> Bill: I READ THAT QUOTE,

11:08.234 --> 11:09.635
VALUES CONTRARY TO OUR VALUES.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.138
WHAT YOUR VALUE IS FREE SPEECH.

11:12.204 --> 11:17.977
THE MOST FAMOUS CASE, DEFENDED

11:18.044 --> 11:19.278
THE NAZIS BEING ABLE TO MARCH IN

11:19.345 --> 11:22.281
SKOKIE, ILLINOIS, IN 1977.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.482
I'M GUESSING THE NAZIS DID NOT

11:23.549 --> 11:25.451
REFLECT YOUR VALUES.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.154
>> THAT'S A GOOD GUESS.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.588
[LAUGHTER]

11:29.655 --> 11:32.425
ACTUALLY, MOST OF THE SPEECH WE

11:32.491 --> 11:33.893
DEFENDED DIDN'T REFLECT OUR

11:33.959 --> 11:34.160
VALUES --

11:34.226 --> 11:35.394
>> Bill: OF COURSE.

11:35.461 --> 11:35.861
>> THAT IS THE POINT.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.997
>> Bill: THAT IS THE POINT.

11:38.064 --> 11:38.998
HE MENTIONED THE FLAG.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.266
THIS IS THE PROBLEM HUMANS HAVE

11:40.332 --> 11:41.400
BUT NOW THEY HAVE A BIGGER

11:41.467 --> 11:42.802
PROBLEM WITH IT THAN THEY DID IN

11:42.868 --> 11:45.204
THE OLD DAYS WHEN THEY WERE MORE

11:45.271 --> 11:46.605
SOPHISTICATED.

11:46.672 --> 11:47.273
THERE'S CONCEPTS LIKE

11:47.339 --> 11:50.643
FREE SPEECH, AND THEN THERE'S

11:50.709 --> 11:52.144
NAZIS AND FLAGS, WHICH ARE

11:52.211 --> 11:52.411
CONCRETE.

11:52.478 --> 11:57.883
AND YOU SEE A NAZI, YOU SEE A

11:57.950 --> 11:59.618
FLAG BURNING, YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.253
>> OR IF YOU ARE ANTITOBACCO IN

12:01.320 --> 12:02.855
INTO SEE A TOBACCO AD, YOU DON'T

12:02.922 --> 12:03.589
LIKE THAT.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.024
OR IF YOU ARE FOR WOMEN'S

12:05.091 --> 12:06.692
EQUALITY YOU SEE "PLAYBOY"

12:06.759 --> 12:09.128
MAGAZINE, YOU DON'T LIKE THAT.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.596
PEOPLE USED TO SAY TO ME ISN'T

12:10.663 --> 12:11.864
IT HARD TO DEFEND FREE SPEECH

12:11.931 --> 12:13.132
WHEN SO FEW PEOPLE IN THIS

12:13.199 --> 12:15.634
COUNTRY ARE IN FAVOR OF IT?

12:15.701 --> 12:17.870
IN MY RESPONSE ALWAYS WAS NO,

12:17.937 --> 12:18.404
THAT'S WRONG.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.872
EVERYBODY IS IN FAVOR OF

12:19.939 --> 12:22.074
FREE SPEECH, AS LONG AS IT THERE

12:22.141 --> 12:23.442
IS.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.243
>> Bill: WRITES.

12:24.310 --> 12:24.944
>> AND

12:25.010 --> 12:26.979
EVERYBODY HAS AN EXCEPTION.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.849
EVERYBODY SAYS WELL, I BELIEVE

12:29.915 --> 12:31.050
IN FREE SPEECH, BUT.

12:31.117 --> 12:32.485
>> Bill: AND IT DOESN'T WORK

12:32.551 --> 12:32.751
THEN.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.620
CAN I SHOW A QUOTE FROM THE

12:34.687 --> 12:36.155
CURRENT HEAD, ANTHONY ROMERO,

12:36.222 --> 12:37.289
I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH

12:37.356 --> 12:38.224
THIS GENTLEMAN.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.992
HE SAID, I REJECT THAT WE NEED

12:40.059 --> 12:42.161
AN ENTRANCE EXAM ON CIVIL

12:42.228 --> 12:44.196
LIBERTIES TO ESTABLISH THE

12:44.263 --> 12:47.099
BONA FIDES TO WORK HERE.

12:47.166 --> 12:47.633
WHAT?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.735
YOU DON'T NEED AN ENTRANCE EXAM

12:49.802 --> 12:52.238
ON CIVIL LIBERTIES IN AN

12:52.304 --> 12:52.905
ORGANIZATION CALLED THE AMERICAN

12:52.972 --> 12:55.241
CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION?

12:55.307 --> 12:57.977
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THEM

12:58.043 --> 12:59.111
DIRECTLY?

12:59.178 --> 13:00.579
>> YOU KNOW, THAT MIGHT BE TRUE

13:00.646 --> 13:03.983
FOR HIRING PEOPLE TO WORK IN THE

13:04.049 --> 13:04.316
XEROX ROOM.

13:04.383 --> 13:07.786
[LAUGHTER]

13:07.853 --> 13:09.722
>> Bill: YEAH, HE'S NOT

13:09.788 --> 13:11.023
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.091
>> THAT'S EXACTLY -- BUT YOU

13:12.158 --> 13:14.193
KNOW, IF YOU'RE HIRING A LAWYER

13:14.260 --> 13:15.161
TO DEFEND THE FIRST AMENDMENT,

13:15.227 --> 13:16.929
YOU WANT TO HAVE A REASONABLE

13:16.996 --> 13:18.831
ASSUMPTION THAT HE LIKES THE

13:18.898 --> 13:20.833
FIRST AMENDMENT, THAT HE

13:20.900 --> 13:21.467
SUPPORTS THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.902
>> Bill: OR KNOWS OF THEM.

13:22.968 --> 13:28.107
[APPLAUSE]

13:28.174 --> 13:32.144
>> IF YOU'RE HIRING SOMEBODY, A

13:32.211 --> 13:33.812
LAWYER TO DEFEND REPRODUCTIVE

13:33.879 --> 13:36.182
CHOICE FOR WOMEN, YOU WANT TO BE

13:36.248 --> 13:37.316
REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THEY

13:37.383 --> 13:39.351
BELIEVE IN REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.120
NOW, I'M SURE IT'S POSSIBLE FOR

13:41.187 --> 13:42.755
A GOOD LAWYER TO DEFEND THINGS

13:42.821 --> 13:46.192
THAT HE OR SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE

13:46.258 --> 13:47.793
IN, BUT AT A BECAUSE

13:47.860 --> 13:48.460
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ACLU, IT

13:48.527 --> 13:51.197
WASN'T SO MUCH YOU HAD TO HAVE

13:51.263 --> 13:52.131
AN ENTRANCE EXAM, BUT WHY WOULD

13:52.198 --> 13:55.034
YOU WANT TO HIRE SOMEBODY WHO

13:55.100 --> 13:58.671
DIDN'T AGREE WITH WHAT YOU WERE

13:58.737 --> 13:59.371
PUSHING?

13:59.438 --> 14:03.142
>> Bill: IT SEEMS LIKE --

14:03.209 --> 14:04.443
ORGANIZATIONS DO DRIFT.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.679
I MEAN, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS

14:06.745 --> 14:08.013
TO BE ABOUT SMALL GOVERNMENT AND

14:08.080 --> 14:11.083
LOWER TAXES, AND NOW IT'S BECOME

14:11.150 --> 14:12.985
AN AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY

14:13.052 --> 14:13.752
CULT.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.187
WE CALL THAT A DRIFT.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.156
WE SEE IT IN TELEVISION.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.557
NETWORKS DON'T EVEN DO WHAT

14:18.624 --> 14:20.759
THEIR NAME SAYS, LIKE MTV WAS

14:20.826 --> 14:21.193
MUSIC TELEVISION.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.662
THEY HAVE NO MORE MUSIC.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.798
THE LEARNING CHANNEL HAD SARAH

14:25.864 --> 14:26.465
PALIN ON.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.335
[LAUGHTER]

14:29.401 --> 14:31.437
>> THAT'S A LESSON.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.572
THAT'S A GOOD LESSON.

14:33.639 --> 14:38.410
YOU KNOW, THE ACLU HAS BECOME,

14:38.477 --> 14:41.447
NOT TOTALLY, THIS IS NOT 100 TO

14:41.513 --> 14:45.751
NOTHING, BUT THEY BECOME MORE OF

14:45.818 --> 14:47.286
A POLITICAL, PARTISAN, WHAT THEY

14:47.353 --> 14:49.922
CALL PROGRESSIVE ORGANIZATION.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.190
NOW, ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE

14:51.257 --> 14:52.057
RIGHT TO CHANGE.

14:52.124 --> 14:52.992
THEY CAN DO THAT.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.893
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, THERE ISN'T

14:54.960 --> 14:56.395
ANY OTHER ACLU.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.731
IF THERE ISN'T SOMEBODY WHO IS

14:58.797 --> 14:59.632
PREPARED TO DEFEND WHAT YOU SAY

14:59.698 --> 15:02.768
AND PREPARED TO DEFEND WHAT THE

15:02.835 --> 15:06.438
NAZIS AND PREPARED TO DEFEND

15:06.505 --> 15:07.773
WHAT PEOPLE FOR ABORTION SAY AND

15:07.840 --> 15:09.742
PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAINST ABORTION

15:09.808 --> 15:11.310
SAY, THEN THE GOVERNMENT GETS TO

15:11.377 --> 15:12.444
DECIDE WHO CAN SPEAK, AND THAT

15:12.511 --> 15:14.980
IS THE MOST DANGEROUS THING --

15:15.047 --> 15:16.849
>> Bill: WELL, THE GOVERNMENT

15:16.915 --> 15:17.650
AND THE TECH COMPANIES ARE

15:17.716 --> 15:18.550
REALLY THE ONES WHO DECIDE THAT

15:18.617 --> 15:20.452
THESE DAYS.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.421
>> WELL, IT USED TO BE THE

15:22.488 --> 15:23.922
GOVERNMENT AND THE NEWSPAPERS.

15:23.989 --> 15:27.026
THAT'S TRUE.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.093
YOU CAN HAVE FOX NEWS, YOU CAN

15:28.160 --> 15:33.632
HAVE THE TIMES, YOU CAN HAVE THE

15:33.699 --> 15:35.534
NATION MAGAZINE, A THOUSAND

15:35.601 --> 15:35.968
FLOWERS BLOOM.

15:36.035 --> 15:36.935
BUT THE REAL DANGER TO CIVIL

15:37.002 --> 15:39.038
LIBERTIES AND THE REAL DANGER TO

15:39.104 --> 15:39.972
SPEECH IS LETTING THE GOVERNMENT

15:40.039 --> 15:42.975
PICK AND CHOOSE.

15:43.042 --> 15:44.410
IMAGINE TRUMP PICKING AND

15:44.476 --> 15:46.578
CHOOSING WHO GETS TO SPEAK.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.013
IMAGINE RUDY GIULIANI -- I DON'T

15:48.080 --> 15:49.548
HAVE TO IMAGINE IT, HE WAS MAYOR

15:49.615 --> 15:51.216
IN MY CITY FOR YEARS.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.719
WE FILED MORE FIRST AMENDMENT

15:53.786 --> 15:54.453
LAWSUITS AGAINST RUDY GIULIANI

15:54.520 --> 15:56.622
THAN ANY MAYOR IN THE HISTORY OF

15:56.689 --> 15:57.189
NEW YORK.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.357
HE DIDN'T LIKE A PAINTING IN THE

15:58.424 --> 16:00.693
MUSEUM, HE TRIED TO GET RID OF

16:00.759 --> 16:01.460
IT.

16:01.527 --> 16:01.827
>> Bill: WRITES.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.329
>> YOU

16:03.395 --> 16:08.133
CAN'T ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO PE

16:08.200 --> 16:09.768
WHAT SPEECH IS ALLOWED AND THE

16:09.835 --> 16:11.337
ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS DEFEND

16:11.403 --> 16:12.171
SPEECH NO MATTER WHAT THE

16:12.237 --> 16:14.306
CONTENT IS.

16:14.373 --> 16:14.573
[APPLAUSE]

16:14.640 --> 16:17.476
>> Bill: YES.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.678
I MEAN, ALL THE THINGS YOU

16:19.745 --> 16:20.212
MENTIONED, YOU ARE RIGHT.

16:20.279 --> 16:23.015
THEY ARE THREATS TO FREE SPEECH.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.050
I ALSO THINK THIS IDEA THAT

16:25.117 --> 16:28.354
FEELINGS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT

16:28.420 --> 16:28.954
THING IS A GREAT THREAT TO --

16:29.021 --> 16:34.193
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M JEWISH

16:34.259 --> 16:36.395
AND I HAD RELATIVES WHO WERE

16:36.462 --> 16:40.032
VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST.

16:40.099 --> 16:46.872
AND I KNOW WHAT FEELINGS WERE

16:46.939 --> 16:47.406
GENERATED BY THE HOLOCAUST

16:47.473 --> 16:50.809
SURVIVORS IN SKOKIE WHEN PEOPLE

16:50.876 --> 16:51.744
WITH SWASTIKAS ON THEIR ARM CAME

16:51.810 --> 16:55.681
TO DEMONSTRATE IN THAT TOWN.

16:55.748 --> 16:56.749
NOTHING COULD BE WORSE THAN

16:56.815 --> 17:00.018
THAT, EXCEPT POSSIBLY HOW BLACK

17:00.085 --> 17:02.087
PEOPLE FELT IN MISSISSIPPI WHEN

17:02.154 --> 17:04.289
PEOPLE RAN AROUND WITH WHITE

17:04.356 --> 17:06.325
SHEETS AND PILLOWCASES ON THEIR

17:06.392 --> 17:06.925
HEAD AND DEMONSTRATED.

17:06.992 --> 17:10.396
THOSE ARE REAL FEELINGS.

17:10.462 --> 17:12.030
BUT I ONCE HEARD A PROPOSAL IN

17:12.097 --> 17:14.166
THE ACLU WHEN I WAS THERE THAT

17:14.233 --> 17:17.803
SAID, WHY DON'T WE SAY THAT IT'S

17:17.870 --> 17:18.537
ALL RIGHT TO PROHIBIT SPEECH

17:18.604 --> 17:21.340
THAT CAUSES EMOTIONAL STRESS?

17:21.407 --> 17:24.610
AND I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE

17:24.676 --> 17:25.444
PERSON WHO SUGGESTED THAT AND

17:25.511 --> 17:28.013
SAID, YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME I

17:28.080 --> 17:29.481
OPEN MY MOUTH I'M LOOKING TO

17:29.548 --> 17:31.817
CAUSE EMOTIONAL STRESS.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.119
[LAUGHTER]

17:34.186 --> 17:38.791
AND I'M ABOUT TO DO IT AGAIN.

17:38.857 --> 17:40.592
YOU KNOW, BUCKLEY'S WIFE AND A

17:40.659 --> 17:41.994
DINNER WE WERE AT ONCE SAID TO

17:42.060 --> 17:43.562
ME, I USED TO BE ON HIS SHOW A

17:43.629 --> 17:47.433
LOT AND SHE SAID TO ME, WHY ARE

17:47.499 --> 17:50.035
YOU SO MEAN TO MY HUSBAND, BILL,

17:50.102 --> 17:50.569
SHE SAID.

17:50.636 --> 17:51.737
I SAID PAT, HE SAYS SUCH

17:51.804 --> 17:54.406
TERRIBLE THINGS.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.474
AND IT WOULD BE IRRATIONAL NOT

17:55.541 --> 17:56.575
TO BE MEAN TO HIM.

17:56.642 --> 17:59.978
THAT IS WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.180
[LAUGHTER]

18:01.246 --> 18:03.649
AND SO, FOR THE ACLU TO DECIDE

18:03.715 --> 18:06.418
THAT THAT KIND OF STUFF NEEDS TO

18:06.485 --> 18:08.987
BE PROHIBITED, RESTRICTED OR

18:09.054 --> 18:12.257
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DEFEND IT

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

19:14.319 --> 19:16.054
>> Bill: OKAY, GREAT TO SEE

19:16.121 --> 19:16.355
YOU BOTH.

19:16.421 --> 19:19.358
LAST WEEK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

19:19.424 --> 19:20.359
COVID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

19:20.425 --> 19:20.559
SHOW.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.094
WE ARE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN

19:22.160 --> 19:23.362
BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING A BIG

19:23.428 --> 19:26.532
NATIONAL DEBATE HERE ABOUT I

19:26.598 --> 19:27.432
THINK LIFE AND DEATH AND WHAT

19:27.499 --> 19:29.468
SHOULD WE DO MOVING FORWARD AND

19:29.535 --> 19:32.304
WHO IS BEING SELFISH OR NOT, SO

19:32.371 --> 19:33.805
A LOT OF PEOPLE ATTACK ME BUT I

19:33.872 --> 19:37.976
JUST WANT TO SAY MY OPINION, WE

19:38.043 --> 19:39.311
SHOULD GET BACK TO NORMAL.

19:39.378 --> 19:43.015
I AM IN GOOD IF I'M CRAZY.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.583
BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR OF

19:44.650 --> 19:45.183
PENNSYLVANIA, HE'S A DEMOCRAT,

19:45.250 --> 19:48.287
HE SAID THIS WEEK I THINK

19:48.353 --> 19:50.155
EVERYBODY'S ANGRY, IT'S BEEN TWO

19:50.222 --> 19:50.556
YEARS NOW.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.057
WE ARE FATIGUED AND READY TO

19:52.124 --> 19:52.958
MOVE ON.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.593
I THINK A LOT OF POLITICAL

19:54.660 --> 19:56.128
VECTORS ARE REFLECTING THAT.

19:56.194 --> 19:56.328
OKAY.

19:56.395 --> 20:00.299
I SEE DENMARK, I MENTIONED LAST

20:00.365 --> 20:00.899
WEEK, THE U.K., BORIS JOHNSON

20:00.966 --> 20:03.602
SAID WE ARE OPENING BACK UP.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.370
NOW I SEE THE PRIME MINISTER OF

20:05.437 --> 20:06.605
DENMARK SAID, WE SAY GOODBYE TO

20:06.672 --> 20:07.506
THE RESTRICTIONS AND WELCOME THE

20:07.573 --> 20:10.842
LIFE WE KNEW BEFORE.

20:10.909 --> 20:13.011
AS OF FEBRUARY 1ST, DENMARK WILL

20:13.078 --> 20:15.847
REOPEN.

20:15.914 --> 20:16.982
MATT, I WANTED TO READ YOUR

20:17.049 --> 20:18.584
QUOTE, I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY

20:18.650 --> 20:19.217
INTERESTING IN YOUR ARTICLE, YOU

20:19.284 --> 20:22.120
WERE TALKING ABOUT KIDS AND YOU

20:22.187 --> 20:24.423
SAID THAT, WE NEED RELIEF FROM

20:24.489 --> 20:26.625
THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY

20:26.692 --> 20:29.895
NEUROTIC STATISTS AND ULTIMATELY

20:29.962 --> 20:30.562
SELFISH ADULTS.

20:30.629 --> 20:31.997
[APPLAUSE]

20:32.064 --> 20:33.932
I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT, AND

20:33.999 --> 20:35.434
PARTICULARLY I'M INTERESTED IN

20:35.500 --> 20:38.437
THE WORD "SELFISH" BECAUSE IT'S

20:38.503 --> 20:39.338
ALWAYS LOVED PEOPLE WHO ARE

20:39.404 --> 20:41.340
SAYING THAT WE ARE, THAT WE WANT

20:41.406 --> 20:42.674
TO REOPEN, THAT WE ARE THE

20:42.741 --> 20:43.508
SELFISH ONES.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.143
IF YOU ARE FOR MAXIMUM SAFETY IN

20:45.210 --> 20:46.678
ALL SITUATIONS YOU WERE THE GOOD

20:46.745 --> 20:48.747
PEOPLE IN THIS IS SELFISH.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.415
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION, WHO IS

20:50.482 --> 20:52.117
REALLY BEING SELFISH AT THIS

20:52.184 --> 20:52.317
POINT?

20:52.384 --> 20:53.785
>> THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WANTING TO

20:53.852 --> 20:55.587
KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED, THERE ARE

20:55.654 --> 20:57.055
STILL CLOSED IN FLINT, MICHIGAN,

20:57.122 --> 20:58.390
WHO HAVE PERSONNEL PROBLEMS AS

20:58.457 --> 20:58.590
WELL.

20:58.657 --> 21:00.292
BUT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO IMPOSE

21:00.359 --> 21:02.761
THE TYPES OF RULES THAT ARE NOT

21:02.828 --> 21:03.929
BEING FOLLOWED OR RECOMMENDED

21:03.996 --> 21:05.631
PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE

21:05.697 --> 21:06.431
WORLD.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.933
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

21:08.000 --> 21:10.802
SAYS DON'T MASK KIDS UNDER 5.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.571
NEW YORK AND 14 OTHER STATES,

21:12.638 --> 21:14.973
ALL OF WHICH VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN

21:15.040 --> 21:17.876
INCIDENTALLY, FOLLOWED THE CDC

21:17.943 --> 21:19.578
GUIDELINES, MASK FROM AGE 2.

21:19.645 --> 21:20.979
MY DAUGHTER WHO JUST

21:21.046 --> 21:22.080
TURNED 7 THIS WEEK HAS BEEN

21:22.147 --> 21:24.650
WEARING A MASK FOR 30% OF HER

21:24.716 --> 21:26.985
LIFE, AND IN JANUARY, AS OLD

21:27.052 --> 21:29.921
MICRON IS THANKFULLY SHAPED AS A

21:29.988 --> 21:37.162
STEEPLE, AS O OMICRON WAS

21:37.229 --> 21:38.196
UPDATING, YOU HAVE TO WEAR A

21:38.263 --> 21:39.831
MASK EVERY DAY IN YOUR SCHOOL

21:39.898 --> 21:41.133
WHERE EVERY KID IS VACCINATED

21:41.199 --> 21:42.567
AND EVERY TEACHER IS VACCINATED.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.902
WHO ARE WE PROTECTING IN THAT

21:43.969 --> 21:44.169
SCENARIO?

21:44.236 --> 21:48.173
WE DON'T REALIZE WHERE WE ARE

21:48.240 --> 21:49.941
DEPARTING FROM BASIC SCIENTIFIC

21:50.008 --> 21:50.709
UNDERSTANDINGS OF THINGS AND

21:50.776 --> 21:52.310
GETTING INTO OUR OWN

21:52.377 --> 21:53.945
UNDERSTANDABLE AT FIRST SENSE OF

21:54.012 --> 21:55.414
FEAR AND PANIC.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.014
BUT WE ARE ADULTS.

21:56.081 --> 21:58.684
WE HAVE TO ASSESS RISKS.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.818
WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THAT AND

21:59.885 --> 22:01.386
WE'VE BEEN INFLICTING IT ON THE

22:01.453 --> 22:03.155
MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION, AND

22:03.221 --> 22:04.723
IT'S A DISASTER.

22:04.790 --> 22:05.323
IT'S BEEN REALLY, REALLY BAD.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.993
[APPLAUSE]

22:08.060 --> 22:08.527
>> Bill: OKAY WITH THAT?

22:08.593 --> 22:12.931
>> YEAH.

22:12.998 --> 22:16.768
>> Bill: WELL, DAVID LEONHARDT

22:16.835 --> 22:18.904
I THINK IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"

22:18.970 --> 22:20.605
THE ONLY SANE VOICE THERE IN MY

22:20.672 --> 22:22.607
VIEW, FANTASTIC.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.543
HERE'S A GREAT QUOTE FROM HIM.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.812
THIS WEEK HE WROTE, MILLIONS OF

22:26.878 --> 22:27.379
DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED THAT

22:27.446 --> 22:30.916
ORGANIZING THEIR LIVES AROUND

22:30.982 --> 22:33.251
COVID IS CORE TO THEIR IDENTITY

22:33.318 --> 22:33.952
AS PROGRESSIVE'S.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.921
THAT'S REALLY A KEY TO THIS.

22:35.987 --> 22:36.988
BECAUSE AGAIN, THESE ARE THE

22:37.055 --> 22:38.890
SCIENCE PEOPLE AND THEY ARE NOT

22:38.957 --> 22:41.693
LISTENING TO BASIC SCIENCE.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.731
I SEE PEOPLE IN CARS ALONE, IN A

22:45.797 --> 22:46.698
CAR, WITH THE MASK.

22:46.765 --> 22:48.333
DID THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

22:48.400 --> 22:51.169
GET IT FROM THE RADIO?

22:51.236 --> 22:52.003
[LAUGHTER]

22:52.070 --> 22:59.344
[APPLAUSE]

22:59.411 --> 23:01.613
>> THEY MIGHT BE WANTING TO BE

23:01.680 --> 23:02.714
INCOGNITO.

23:02.781 --> 23:03.749
I HAVE TO SAY, I HAVE PUT THE

23:03.815 --> 23:06.118
MASK ON WHEN I DON'T WANT ANYONE

23:06.184 --> 23:07.552
TO KNOW IT'S ME GOING BY.

23:07.619 --> 23:09.187
HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT?

23:09.254 --> 23:10.956
>> THE LEVEL OF NOTORIETY.

23:11.022 --> 23:13.391
>> I HAVE DONE THAT, I HAVE TO

23:13.458 --> 23:13.625
CONFESS.

23:13.692 --> 23:17.329
>> Bill: BUT WHY CAN'T WE

23:17.395 --> 23:20.465
PRECISELY TARGET, AND I DON'T

23:20.532 --> 23:22.768
MEAN TARGET, PROTECT THE PEOPLE

23:22.834 --> 23:24.002
WHO ARE VULNERABLE AND LET

23:24.069 --> 23:24.603
SOCIETY GET BACK?

23:24.669 --> 23:29.908
HERE'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

23:29.975 --> 23:32.144
LANCET CAME OUT THIS WEEK, UP TO

23:32.210 --> 23:34.012
90%, THEIR HEAD GUY SAID, I

23:34.079 --> 23:36.515
THINK IT WAS THEIR HEAD GUY,

23:36.581 --> 23:39.217
SAID OMICRON PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT,

23:39.284 --> 23:39.985
ASYMPTOMATIC.

23:40.051 --> 23:42.654
WITH THE OTHER VARIANTS IT WAS

23:42.721 --> 23:44.055
LIKE 40%.

23:44.122 --> 23:45.357
EVEN 40%, THINK ABOUT THAT.

23:45.423 --> 23:48.393
THE HORRIBLE DELTA, THE HORRIBLE

23:48.460 --> 23:50.695
COVID CLASSIC.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.363
[LAUGHTER]

23:51.429 --> 23:52.898
ALMOST HALF THE PEOPLE NEVER

23:52.964 --> 23:54.533
EVEN KNEW THEY HAD IT.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.902
THAT NEVER HAPPENED WITH

23:56.968 --> 23:58.937
SMALLPOX.

23:59.004 --> 24:01.339
OKAY, NOW HE SAYS, OMICRON, UP

24:01.406 --> 24:03.575
TO 90% COULD BE ASYMPTOMATIC.

24:03.642 --> 24:04.976
AND I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE WHO

24:05.043 --> 24:06.077
HAVE HAD IT BECAUSE IT'S

24:06.144 --> 24:06.845
EVERYWHERE.

24:06.912 --> 24:10.015
AND THEY ARE LIKE, IT'S NOTHING.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.750
I'VE HAD HANGOVERS THAT WERE

24:11.817 --> 24:11.950
WORSE.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.285
[LAUGHTER]

24:13.351 --> 24:13.518
REALLY.

24:13.585 --> 24:16.621
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

24:16.688 --> 24:17.055
STILL DYING.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.191
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE A DAY.

24:19.257 --> 24:20.992
I WANT TO KNOW HOW BOTH THINGS

24:21.059 --> 24:23.395
CAN BE POSSIBLE, SO I'M

24:23.461 --> 24:25.564
ASKING -- I'VE GOT, WHO IS

24:25.630 --> 24:26.331
DYING.

24:26.398 --> 24:31.970
99% FROM JUNE 2021 OF COVID-19

24:32.037 --> 24:34.139
DEATHS, UNVACCINATED.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.540
78%, I READ THIS BEFORE, OF THE

24:35.607 --> 24:39.177
PEOPLE HOSPITALIZED OR DIED,

24:39.244 --> 24:39.911
OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE.

24:39.978 --> 24:45.483
PEOPLE OVER 65 MAKE UP 75% OF

24:45.550 --> 24:46.518
ALL COVID DEATHS.

24:46.585 --> 24:47.953
IN OTHER WORDS, WE COULD BE MORE

24:48.019 --> 24:51.756
PRECISE ABOUT THIS.

24:51.823 --> 24:52.757
WE COULD PINPOINT AND HELP

24:52.824 --> 24:53.959
PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

24:54.025 --> 24:54.659
VULNERABLE IN THE REST OF US GO

24:54.726 --> 24:57.963
BACK TO LIFE, IT SEEMS TO ME,

24:58.029 --> 24:58.830
AND WE DON'T DO THAT.

24:58.897 --> 24:59.197
WHY?

24:59.264 --> 25:00.799
>> I THINK IT'S PARTLY THE WAY

25:00.866 --> 25:02.267
WE'VE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.302
YOU'VE ALREADY TOUCHED ON IT,

25:04.369 --> 25:05.203
YOU JUST SAID PART OF THE

25:05.270 --> 25:08.306
PROBLEM IS THE DEMOCRATS ON THE

25:08.373 --> 25:10.141
ONE HAND THINK ONE THING, OF

25:10.208 --> 25:11.376
COURSE WE KNOW THAT ON THE

25:11.443 --> 25:12.744
OTHER, REPUBLICANS.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.379
I WAS LITERALLY IN A COFFEE SHOP

25:14.446 --> 25:15.647
UP IN WISCONSIN WHEN I WAS

25:15.714 --> 25:16.548
VISITING SOME OF MY IN-LAWS AND

25:16.615 --> 25:19.551
THE GUY IN FRONT OF ME, I WAS

25:19.618 --> 25:20.552
WEARING A MASK BECAUSE THIS WAS

25:20.619 --> 25:22.354
IN THE PEAK OF THE

25:22.420 --> 25:23.421
DELTA VARIANT, AND THE GUY SAID

25:23.488 --> 25:24.990
TO HIS FRIEND, OF COURSE I'M NOT

25:25.056 --> 25:26.491
GOING TO GET VACCINATED OR WEAR

25:26.558 --> 25:30.128
A MASK BECAUSE I'M REPUBLICAN.

25:30.195 --> 25:30.795
AND I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT WHAT?

25:30.862 --> 25:32.764
HOW ARE WE MAKING THESE

25:32.831 --> 25:34.266
DECISIONS BASED ON A PARTISAN

25:34.332 --> 25:34.466
BASIS?

25:34.532 --> 25:36.534
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE GETTING AT

25:36.601 --> 25:37.102
HERE, PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY

25:37.168 --> 25:40.171
LOOKING AT IDENTITY POLITICS,

25:40.238 --> 25:40.839
PERSONAL POLITICAL PREFERENCES.

25:40.906 --> 25:43.008
WE'VE GOT SO POLARIZED WE ARE

25:43.074 --> 25:43.642
NOT MAKING RATIONAL JUDGMENTS.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.378
I AM PROBABLY WITH YOU GUYS, MY

25:46.444 --> 25:48.380
DAUGHTER WHO IS 15, VERSUS MY

25:48.446 --> 25:49.147
MOTHER WHO IS 87.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.515
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY MOTHER IN MORE

25:50.582 --> 25:50.882
THAN TWO YEARS.

25:50.949 --> 25:53.718
SHE IS NOW IN A RESIDENTIAL HOME

25:53.785 --> 25:55.120
IN THE U.K., BUT SHE IS

25:55.186 --> 25:55.620
OBVIOUSLY AT RISK.

25:55.687 --> 25:58.123
WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER IS IN A

25:58.189 --> 25:59.524
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CATEGORY,

25:59.591 --> 26:00.492
SO WE NEED TO HAVE A SENSIBLE

26:00.558 --> 26:01.059
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT NOT

26:01.126 --> 26:03.028
BASED ON WHAT MY POLITICAL

26:03.094 --> 26:03.995
PREFERENCE IS.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.463
>> Bill: THAT WE PROTECT THE

26:05.530 --> 26:06.898
PEOPLE -- I WOULD SPEND ANY

26:06.965 --> 26:07.966
AMOUNT OF TAX MONEY TO DO THAT,

26:08.033 --> 26:09.334
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRULY

26:09.401 --> 26:11.636
VULNERABLE.

26:11.703 --> 26:14.572
STEPHEN BREYER DOESN'T WANT TO

26:14.639 --> 26:21.780
WORK WITH C NEIL GORSUCH BECAUSE

26:21.846 --> 26:24.049
HE WON'T WEAR A MASK.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.784
HE'S 83, I AGREE WITH THAT.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.585
BUT THIS IS NOT A COUNTRY WHERE

26:27.652 --> 26:28.987
MOST PEOPLE ARE AROUND AND

26:29.054 --> 26:29.888
83-YEAR-OLD.

26:29.955 --> 26:30.889
IT JUST ISN'T, BECAUSE WE ARE IN

26:30.956 --> 26:32.691
A JUST COUNTRY.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.693
[APPLAUSE]

26:34.759 --> 26:35.927
SPEAK I WOULD ALSO

26:35.994 --> 26:37.796
LIKE TO -- IT'S COMPLETELY RIGHT

26:37.862 --> 26:40.732
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT F

26:40.799 --> 26:41.466
POLICIES OF MASKING, VACCINE

26:41.533 --> 26:43.935
MANDATES AND WHATEVER YOU PEOPLE

26:44.002 --> 26:46.805
HAD TO DO TO GET INTO THIS

26:46.871 --> 26:48.206
BUILDING TODAY BY CALIFORNIA

26:48.273 --> 26:50.408
LAW, UNSPEAKABLE ACTS ON

26:50.475 --> 26:51.309
FAIRFAX.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.610
BUT NO, IT'S BASED ON

26:52.677 --> 26:53.411
PARTISANSHIP.

26:53.478 --> 26:54.579
IT'S BASED ON WHO YOU VOTE FOR

26:54.646 --> 26:55.914
IN THE ELECTION, WHICH IS

26:55.981 --> 26:56.348
BANANAS TO ME.

26:56.414 --> 26:57.782
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT PART OF THAT,

26:57.849 --> 26:59.918
I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE THIS

26:59.985 --> 27:01.152
KIND OF SEMITRUCE.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.755
EACH SIDE, TEAM RED INTIME BLUE

27:03.822 --> 27:05.423
DID ONE GOOD THING, ONE BIG

27:05.490 --> 27:07.325
THING GREAT AND ONE THING

27:07.392 --> 27:07.959
TERRIBLE.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.327
TEAM BLUE, YOU DID SO GREAT ON

27:09.394 --> 27:11.496
THE THING THAT MATTERS THE MOST,

27:11.563 --> 27:12.597
YOU GOT VACCINATED.

27:12.664 --> 27:13.198
IT'S THE GREATEST PROTECTION

27:13.264 --> 27:15.734
POSSIBLE AGAINST THIS THING.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.035
GET THE VACCINE, YOU'RE PROBABLY

27:17.102 --> 27:18.103
NOT GOING TO DIE FOR HEALTHY.

27:18.169 --> 27:21.373
>> Bill: 80% OF REPUBLICANS

27:21.439 --> 27:21.973
OVER 65 GOT THE SHOT.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.575
>> BUT THAT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH

27:23.641 --> 27:24.776
AND A LOT OF THE PLACES THAT ARE

27:24.843 --> 27:25.977
GETTING HURT RIGHT NOW,

27:26.044 --> 27:28.580
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T DO THAT STUFF

27:28.646 --> 27:29.614
GOOD, BUT REPUBLICANS DID KEEP

27:29.681 --> 27:32.517
SCHOOLS OPEN, DIDN'T ISSUE

27:32.584 --> 27:33.218
VACCINE MANDATES TO GO INTO A

27:33.284 --> 27:35.620
BAR.

27:35.687 --> 27:36.955
NEW YORK, YOU'RE FIVE YEARS OLD,

27:37.022 --> 27:38.356
YOU CAN'T GO INSIDE AN INDOOR

27:38.423 --> 27:38.923
BUILDING EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE

27:38.990 --> 27:41.593
COMING FROM EUROPE, YOU CAN'T

27:41.659 --> 27:43.161
GET A VACCINE IN EUROPE THERE.

27:43.228 --> 27:44.696
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF MAD

27:44.763 --> 27:45.964
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.432
IN BLUE STATES THEY GOT THAT

27:47.499 --> 27:47.966
WRONG.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.601
CAN WE ALL SAY THAT WE ALL DID,

27:49.667 --> 27:51.236
AND I DID TOO, WE ALL GOT STUFF

27:51.302 --> 27:51.669
WRONG.

27:51.736 --> 27:52.704
IN THE MEANTIME CAN YOU GET RID

27:52.771 --> 27:54.039
OF SOME OF THESE MANDATES WE

27:54.105 --> 27:57.008
DON'T NEED ANY MORE AFTER THE

27:57.075 --> 27:58.376
OMICRON STEEPLE GOES DOWN, AND

27:58.443 --> 27:59.544
THEN ALSO GET VACCINATED AND

27:59.611 --> 28:00.578
THEN WE CAN GET BACK --

28:00.645 --> 28:02.013
>> Bill: BUT THERE'S GOING TO

28:02.080 --> 28:02.814
BE ANOTHER VARIANT.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.549
EVERY TIME ONE GOES AWAY WE ARE

28:04.616 --> 28:05.216
LIKE, NOW WE ARE OUT OF IT.

28:05.283 --> 28:07.385
WE ARE NEVER OUT OF IT.

28:07.452 --> 28:08.620
WE ARE NEVER OUT OF IT.

28:08.686 --> 28:09.988
IT WANTS TO LIVE AND IT WILL.

28:10.055 --> 28:12.323
IT'S A VIRUS, IT'S GOING TO

28:12.390 --> 28:14.926
EVOLVE, AND WE CAN'T BE LIKE

28:14.993 --> 28:16.394
OKAY, IT'S WHAT WE SAID ABOUT

28:16.461 --> 28:16.861
DELTA.

28:16.928 --> 28:17.896
WHEN THAT GOES AWAY.

28:17.962 --> 28:19.597
THAT CAN'T BE THE TEMPLATE, I'M

28:19.664 --> 28:19.864
SORRY.

28:19.931 --> 28:23.301
IT HAS TO BE, IT'S HERE, IT'S

28:23.368 --> 28:25.703
A --

28:25.770 --> 28:29.674
[LAUGHS]

28:29.741 --> 28:31.209
>> Bill: AND I DON'T NEED MORE

28:31.276 --> 28:31.709
CONTROVERSY.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.445
>> WE HAVE THE PROTECTION FOR

28:33.511 --> 28:34.946
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THAT IS THE

28:35.013 --> 28:35.613
MAIN ARGUMENT, WE HAVE THE

28:35.680 --> 28:37.715
PROTECTION FOR IT SO WE SHOULD

28:37.782 --> 28:40.585
BE ABLE TO -- AFTER THE ICU BEDS

28:40.652 --> 28:42.053
ARE NO LONGER FELT WE SHOULD BE

28:42.120 --> 28:42.320
ABLE TO --

28:42.387 --> 28:45.457
>> Bill: AGAIN, WHICH CHANGE,

28:45.523 --> 28:46.424
THE VACCINE DOESN'T STOP YOU

28:46.491 --> 28:48.426
FROM GETTING IT AND DOESN'T STOP

28:48.493 --> 28:49.027
YOU FROM TRANSMITTING IT.

28:49.094 --> 28:52.097
IT STOPS YOU FROM DYING.

28:52.163 --> 28:53.198
>> THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.266
>> Bill: THAT IS PRETTY GOOD!

28:55.333 --> 28:56.501
TAKE YOUR VICTORY AND GO HOME.

28:56.568 --> 28:56.768
[APPLAUSE]

28:56.835 --> 29:01.005
AND IF YOU DON'T, I CAN'T BE

29:01.072 --> 29:02.040
MORE INVESTED IN YOUR HEALTH

29:02.107 --> 29:04.075
THAN YOU ARE.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.744
>> YEAH, IT HAS TO BE ABOUT

29:06.811 --> 29:07.078
COMMUNICATION.

29:07.145 --> 29:08.580
WE'VE GOT A SAFE SPACE AT THIS

29:08.646 --> 29:10.515
TABLE, VERY SAFE SPACE WITH

29:10.582 --> 29:11.616
EVERYONE OUT THERE WITH THEIR

29:11.683 --> 29:11.883
MASKS ON.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.419
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

29:14.486 --> 29:14.786
TALK ABOUT THIS.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.020
>> Bill: IT STARTS TO LOOK

29:16.087 --> 29:16.821
LIKE EVERY OTHER GOVERNMENT

29:16.888 --> 29:18.656
PROGRAM AND WHAT IS THE COMMON

29:18.723 --> 29:20.125
THREAD OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS?

29:20.191 --> 29:22.160
>> THEY NEVER END.

29:22.227 --> 29:23.561
>> Bill: EXACTLY.

29:23.628 --> 29:24.729
>> YOU TALK ABOUT MONEY BEING

29:24.796 --> 29:27.198
SPENT ON THIS, WE'VE SPENT A LOT

29:27.265 --> 29:28.032
OF MONEY.

29:28.099 --> 29:28.433
WHERE DID IT GO?

29:28.500 --> 29:31.436
>> JEFF BEZOS TO AMAZON.

29:31.503 --> 29:35.206
>> Bill: RIGHT, AND THOSE

29:35.273 --> 29:36.107
MASKS ARE NOW POLLUTING THE

29:36.174 --> 29:36.307
OCEAN.

29:36.374 --> 29:39.577
THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.

29:39.644 --> 29:40.078
BUT, EXACTLY.

29:40.145 --> 29:42.180
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS NEVER END.

29:42.247 --> 29:45.650
THAT IS WHETHER IT IS A SUBSIDY

29:45.717 --> 29:47.452
OR LET ME BRING UP THIS

29:47.519 --> 29:48.386
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THAT MAYBE

29:48.453 --> 29:51.356
SHOULD HAVE ENDED, NATO.

29:51.422 --> 29:51.823
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

29:51.890 --> 29:53.391
[APPLAUSE]

29:53.458 --> 29:56.794
>> THAT WAS A FUNNY SEGUE.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.530
>> Bill: YOU DON'T THINK THAT

29:58.596 --> 29:59.164
IS A TRUE SEGUE?

29:59.230 --> 30:01.699
>> NO I SAID IT WAS A GREAT

30:01.766 --> 30:01.900
SEGUE.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.569
>> Bill: OH, THANK YOU.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.004
BECAUSE NATO WAS FORMED TO FIGHT

30:06.070 --> 30:06.671
THE SOVIET UNION WHICH

30:06.738 --> 30:09.374
DISAPPEARED IN 1991.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.276
I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE

30:11.342 --> 30:13.912
SHOULD DO ABOUT UKRAINE, IF

30:13.978 --> 30:16.447
RUSSIA LOOKS TO INSTALL A PUPPET

30:16.514 --> 30:17.081
GOVERNMENT, LIKE THEY DID HERE.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.450
[LAUGHTER]

30:19.517 --> 30:25.890
[APPLAUSE]

30:25.957 --> 30:28.960
>> Bill: BUT I MEAN, IS IT

30:29.027 --> 30:31.129
REALLY OUR FIGHT?

30:31.196 --> 30:33.731
AND AGAIN, WHY IS THERE A NATO?

30:33.798 --> 30:34.999
WHEN THE SOVIET UNION WENT AWAY,

30:35.066 --> 30:38.536
WOULD WE HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF

30:38.603 --> 30:41.706
SAYING, WE STILL HATE YOU,

30:41.773 --> 30:41.940
RUSSIA.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.309
IT STARTS TO LOOK LIKE AND

30:44.375 --> 30:47.178
EVERYBODY BUT YOU CLUB.

30:47.245 --> 30:48.880
>> THAT IS DEFINITELY HOW

30:48.947 --> 30:50.148
VLADIMIR PUTIN FEELS.

30:50.215 --> 30:50.715
HE'S WATCHING THIS MONOLOGUE

30:50.782 --> 30:52.951
RIGHT NOW GOING YEP, THAT'S

30:53.017 --> 30:53.585
EXACTLY HOW I FEEL.

30:53.651 --> 30:54.219
>> Bill: I'M NOT SAYING HE'S

30:54.285 --> 30:56.120
NOT A BAD GUY.

30:56.187 --> 30:57.322
HE IS A BAD GUY.

30:57.388 --> 30:58.323
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIM IN

30:58.389 --> 31:02.894
A MINUTE IN A FUNNY WAY.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.496
BUT AGAIN, I'M JUST GOING BACK

31:05.563 --> 31:07.165
30 YEARS AGO WHEN THE

31:07.232 --> 31:08.132
SOVIET UNION FELL.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.500
NATO WAS FORMED STRICTLY TO

31:09.567 --> 31:10.368
COUNTER THE SOVIET UNION.

31:10.435 --> 31:12.537
NOW IT DOESN'T EXIST.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.072
BUT WE SIGN UP 15 NEW COUNTRIES

31:14.138 --> 31:16.140
TO BE AGAINST THE THING THAT

31:16.207 --> 31:17.542
DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.210
OF COURSE RUSSIA STILL EXISTS,

31:19.277 --> 31:20.345
BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A

31:20.411 --> 31:21.946
REACTION TO THAT.

31:22.013 --> 31:25.750
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO

31:25.817 --> 31:26.217
DISBAND NATO WHEN THE

31:26.284 --> 31:29.988
SOVIET UNION WENT AWAY, AS THESE

31:30.054 --> 31:31.289
COUNTRIES BECAME FREE OF THE

31:31.356 --> 31:32.223
SOVIET UNION BUT NOT A PART OF

31:32.290 --> 31:34.392
AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS AGAINST

31:34.459 --> 31:36.694
YOU.

31:36.761 --> 31:37.996
>> IN EASTERN EUROPE AROUND THAT

31:38.062 --> 31:40.064
TIME, BECAUSE THERE'S A

31:40.131 --> 31:40.865
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM WHERE

31:40.932 --> 31:42.267
YOU'RE SITTING AND STANDING AT

31:42.333 --> 31:43.301
THE SAME TIME.

31:43.368 --> 31:44.269
BECAUSE IN EASTERN EUROPE THEY

31:44.335 --> 31:45.370
PROBABLY SAID LET'S KEEP IT, WE

31:45.436 --> 31:47.338
WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT CLUB.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.106
THE RUSSIAN PERSPECTIVE, THEY

31:48.172 --> 31:50.975
WANTED IT TO GO.

31:51.042 --> 31:53.378
>> THEY WERE INTERESTED,

31:53.444 --> 31:54.779
ESPECIALLY THE FIRST GRADUATING

31:54.846 --> 31:56.147
COUNTRIES, CZECHOSLOVAKIA,

31:56.214 --> 31:57.849
POLAND AND HUNGARY, THEY WERE

31:57.915 --> 31:59.350
INTERESTED IN THE COLD WAR

31:59.417 --> 31:59.651
ENDING TOO.

31:59.717 --> 32:01.386
DIDN'T GO SO WELL AFTER ALL FOR

32:01.452 --> 32:03.121
THEM HERE THEY HAVE 100,000 RED

32:03.187 --> 32:03.655
ARMY TROOPS ON THEIR SOIL.

32:03.721 --> 32:04.756
THEY HAD TO GET THEM OUT OF

32:04.822 --> 32:05.823
THERE AND THEY DIDN'T WANT

32:05.890 --> 32:06.291
WASHINGTON HERE.

32:06.357 --> 32:08.259
SO THERE WAS A BIG INITIATIVE AT

32:08.326 --> 32:10.528
THE TIME TO SAY WE WANT A NEW

32:10.595 --> 32:11.162
SECURITY GROUP.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.131
IT WILL BE EUROPEAN, IT WON'T BE

32:13.197 --> 32:14.232
RUSSIAN AND IT WON'T BE

32:14.299 --> 32:15.166
AMERICAN.

32:15.233 --> 32:15.933
IT WILL BE EUROPEAN, LET'S DO

32:16.000 --> 32:20.405
THIS, WHAT DO YOU SAY, EUROPE?

32:20.471 --> 32:21.806
AND CRICKETS.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.508
CRICKETS AND ALSO YUGOSLAVIA,

32:23.574 --> 32:24.642
BAD COMBINATION, GENERALLY

32:24.709 --> 32:27.145
SPEAKING.

32:27.211 --> 32:28.579
[LAUGHTER]

32:28.646 --> 32:29.347
FRANCE, GERMANY AND ENGLAND

32:29.414 --> 32:30.281
COULDN'T GET ANYTHING TOGETHER

32:30.348 --> 32:31.549
SO THEY TRIED FOR TWO YEARS TO

32:31.616 --> 32:33.151
CREATE A THING, NOTHING WAS

32:33.217 --> 32:33.384
CREATED.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.218
MEANWHILE THESE COUNTRIES WHO

32:34.285 --> 32:36.854
HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED

32:36.921 --> 32:37.455
BY 40 YEARS OF COMMUNISM AND

32:37.522 --> 32:40.491
THEIR WHOLE HISTORY BEFORE HAS

32:40.558 --> 32:41.759
BEEN BEING INVADED FROM RIGHT

32:41.826 --> 32:43.194
AND LEFT FROM GERMANY AND

32:43.261 --> 32:43.661
RUSSIA.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.096
THEY WANTED A SECURITY

32:45.163 --> 32:45.363
GUARANTEE.

32:45.430 --> 32:46.564
SO IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF

32:46.631 --> 32:50.068
AMERICA IN 1994, 1993, REALLY

32:50.134 --> 32:51.169
WANTED TO EXPAND NATO.

32:51.235 --> 32:52.170
NOBODY DID.

32:52.236 --> 32:52.770
THOSE COUNTRIES DID.

32:52.837 --> 32:55.373
THEY WANTED A PLACE THAT HAD A

32:55.440 --> 32:55.840
SECURITY GUARANTEE --

32:55.907 --> 32:57.108
>> Bill: WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO

32:57.175 --> 32:58.276
WHAT THEY WANT TO.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.445
>> QUESTION IS --

33:00.511 --> 33:01.879
>> Bill: WE JUST MADE A BAD

33:01.946 --> 33:02.714
DECISION.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.315
THE GUYS AFTER WORLD WAR II,

33:04.382 --> 33:06.017
THOSE GUYS, THEY MADE BRILLIANT

33:06.084 --> 33:07.352
DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THEY HANDLED

33:07.418 --> 33:08.653
THE POSTWAR WORLD.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.887
BRILLIANT.

33:09.954 --> 33:11.022
AND I THINK THESE GUYS FUCKED IT

33:11.089 --> 33:13.257
UP.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.259
>> HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A

33:15.326 --> 33:16.561
GREAT IDEA TO EXPAND NATO

33:16.627 --> 33:17.662
EITHER.

33:17.729 --> 33:18.429
>> Bill: OH OH, REALLY?

33:18.496 --> 33:21.833
>> HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH YOU.

33:21.899 --> 33:25.136
BUT THAT OF COURSE WAS, JUST AS

33:25.203 --> 33:26.904
MATT SAID, THERE WAS A PUSH

33:26.971 --> 33:28.539
COMING FROM ELSEWHERE TO EXPAND

33:28.606 --> 33:29.140
IT.

33:29.207 --> 33:30.575
AT THE TIME, IN THE EARLY PERIOD

33:30.641 --> 33:33.378
OF THE 1990s, WE DID HAVE THIS

33:33.444 --> 33:36.314
BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT SHOULD WE

33:36.381 --> 33:37.882
HAVE SOME OTHER -- WITH RUSSIA.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.017
UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T AND NOW

33:40.084 --> 33:41.519
WE'VE GOT PUTIN TRYING TO

33:41.586 --> 33:42.086
DISMANTLE IT BY FORCE.

33:42.153 --> 33:43.154
>> Bill: WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD

33:43.221 --> 33:47.325
BE A GREAT WEEK TO DO "24 THINGS

33:47.392 --> 33:48.626
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT

33:48.693 --> 33:48.993
VLADIMIR PUTIN."

33:49.060 --> 33:49.327
I DON'T KNOW.

33:49.394 --> 33:53.731
[APPLAUSE]

33:53.798 --> 33:54.999
SOME OF THE FAVORITE DEPARTMENTS

33:55.066 --> 33:58.102
OF OUR SHOW, BUT WE DO "24

33:58.169 --> 34:00.304
THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT."

34:00.371 --> 34:02.173
MAGAZINES DO 25 BUT I THINK OURS

34:02.240 --> 34:03.074
IS BETTER.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.476
LET ME TELL YOU, PUTIN IS KNOWN

34:05.543 --> 34:06.344
TO BE SECRETIVE BUT WHEN WE

34:06.411 --> 34:07.345
INTERVIEWED HIM FOR THAT HE WAS

34:07.412 --> 34:09.013
AN OPEN BOOK.

34:09.080 --> 34:09.280
[LAUGHTER]

34:09.347 --> 34:13.017
FOR EXAMPLE, 24 THINGS YOU DON'T

34:13.084 --> 34:18.823
KNOW ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN,

34:18.890 --> 34:20.425
I'M SELLING THE PEE TAPE AS AN

34:20.491 --> 34:22.693
NFT.

34:22.760 --> 34:27.532
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT HIM.

34:27.598 --> 34:30.435
WHEN IMMERSED IN ICY WATER, MY

34:30.501 --> 34:31.402
PENIS GETS BIGGER.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.137
I AM AN OPTIMIST.

34:33.204 --> 34:33.571
I LOOK AT UKRAINE AS

34:33.638 --> 34:36.641
HALF-INVADED.

34:36.707 --> 34:37.909
[LAUGHTER]

34:37.975 --> 34:38.810
SOMETIMES I THINK ABOUT STEPPING

34:38.876 --> 34:39.710
DOWN FROM LEADERSHIP SO I COULD

34:39.777 --> 34:40.745
DEVOTE MORE OF MY TIME TO

34:40.812 --> 34:43.548
SELLING STOLEN ELECTRONICS.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.850
[APPLAUSE]

34:45.917 --> 34:49.086
[LAUGHTER]

34:49.153 --> 34:49.821
>> Bill: MY FAVORITE '80S HAIR

34:49.887 --> 34:51.022
BAND?

34:51.088 --> 34:51.889
MOTLEY CRUE.

34:51.956 --> 34:52.790
HA!

34:52.857 --> 34:55.827
YOU THOUGHT I'D SAY "POISON."

34:55.893 --> 34:57.929
[LAUGHTER]

34:57.995 --> 34:58.830
I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT RUSSIA

34:58.896 --> 35:00.064
HAS PROBLEMS.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.466
FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUICIDE RATE OF

35:01.532 --> 35:02.033
OUR JOURNALISTS IS OFF THE

35:02.099 --> 35:04.669
CHARTS.

35:04.735 --> 35:09.407
[LAUGHTER]

35:09.474 --> 35:10.141
LET'S JUST SAY I DON'T NOT DRINK

35:10.208 --> 35:15.413
HUMAN BLOOD.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.182
[LAUGHTER]

35:18.249 --> 35:19.717
I OWN A SMALL HOTEL CHAIN IN

35:19.784 --> 35:20.284
UNITED STATES CALLED THE TRUMP

35:20.351 --> 35:23.421
ORGANIZATION.

35:23.488 --> 35:31.429
[LAUGHTER]

35:31.496 --> 35:32.063
TWO INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT MY

35:32.129 --> 35:33.931
TATTOO.

35:33.998 --> 35:35.333
IT SAYS "666" AND IT'S NOT A

35:35.399 --> 35:40.371
TATTOO.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.240
[LAUGHTER]

35:42.306 --> 35:42.507
[APPLAUSE]

35:42.573 --> 35:46.511
>> Bill: OKAY, SO LET'S TALK

35:46.577 --> 35:46.777
COLD WAR.

35:46.844 --> 35:50.414
LET'S TALK ABOUT HERE.

35:50.481 --> 35:51.782
I'VE HEARD YOU SAY WE ARE KIND

35:51.849 --> 35:53.084
OF BEEN A COLD WAR HERE.

35:53.150 --> 35:54.318
THAT IS INTERESTING.

35:54.385 --> 35:56.020
THERE'S LOTS OF TALK ABOUT A

35:56.087 --> 35:59.724
CIVIL WAR, BUT I KEEP SAYING HOW

35:59.790 --> 36:00.291
COULD THAT WORK?

36:00.358 --> 36:01.459
IT'S NOT LIKE THE FIRST

36:01.526 --> 36:02.760
CIVIL WAR WHERE WE WERE ON

36:02.827 --> 36:03.661
DIFFERENT SIDES.

36:03.728 --> 36:08.099
WE ARE ALL MARBLED TOGETHER, MY

36:08.165 --> 36:12.470
DRINK LEADERS BEHIND ENEMY

36:12.537 --> 36:13.237
LINES.

36:13.304 --> 36:13.871
THEY THEY ARE FORMALLY INTERIM

36:13.938 --> 36:14.338
VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA.

36:14.405 --> 36:15.706
THAT IS MORE THAN THERE ARE

36:15.773 --> 36:18.476
PEOPLE IN 30 STATES.

36:18.543 --> 36:20.444
BUT THE TIME OF TROUBLE IS IN

36:20.511 --> 36:22.113
IRELAND, THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE

36:22.179 --> 36:22.480
COMPARING IT TO.

36:22.547 --> 36:24.749
THAT IS INTERESTING.

36:24.815 --> 36:27.652
PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER, IRELAND,

36:27.718 --> 36:30.021
THE SAWED FROM WHICH I WAS

36:30.087 --> 36:32.223
SPAWNED, THEY HAD 30 YEARS WHERE

36:32.290 --> 36:32.690
IT WAS A LOW-LEVEL

36:32.757 --> 36:34.458
CIVIL WAR BUT IT WAS JUST A

36:34.525 --> 36:35.192
BOMBING IN VIOLENCE AND LIFE

36:35.259 --> 36:39.130
WENT ON BUT HORRIBLY BRUTISH,

36:39.196 --> 36:39.931
NASTY AND SMALL.

36:39.997 --> 36:42.600
AND YOU THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN

36:42.667 --> 36:43.935
HERE?

36:44.001 --> 36:45.469
>> KIND OF INTERCOMMUNAL

36:45.536 --> 36:46.304
VIOLENCE.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.306
WE ARE ALL SAYING IT IS GOING TO

36:48.372 --> 36:49.840
BE A CIVIL WAR, BATTLE AT

36:49.907 --> 36:50.575
GETTYSBURG AGAIN, DOESN'T SEEM

36:50.641 --> 36:52.043
TO GET IT FOR MOST PEOPLE BEER

36:52.109 --> 36:53.177
BUT WAS GOING ON IN IRELAND FOR

36:53.244 --> 36:55.446
VERY LONG PERIOD AND I WAS

36:55.513 --> 36:57.949
GROWING UP IN THE NORTH OF

36:58.015 --> 37:00.117
ENGLAND AND IT WAS ON BRITISH

37:00.184 --> 37:01.519
SOIL MORE BROADLY, NOT JUST IN

37:01.586 --> 37:03.721
NORTHERN IRELAND BUT ALSO IN THE

37:03.788 --> 37:04.822
MAINLAND.

37:04.889 --> 37:08.125
OF COURSE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE

37:08.192 --> 37:09.260
BIGGEST IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE

37:09.327 --> 37:10.528
DEVICE BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN

37:10.595 --> 37:10.895
HISTORY.

37:10.962 --> 37:13.531
YOU TEND TO THINK OF THE PLO FOR

37:13.598 --> 37:14.899
SOME OF THIS HAPPENING IN THE

37:14.966 --> 37:15.533
MIDDLE EAST BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY

37:15.600 --> 37:17.501
IN THE U.K.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.704
THEY TRIED TO BLOW UP

37:19.770 --> 37:20.471
MARGARET THATCHER DURING THE

37:20.538 --> 37:20.972
PARTY CONVENTION FOR THE

37:21.038 --> 37:23.574
CONSERVATIVE PARTY.

37:23.641 --> 37:25.443
>> Bill: THEY DID BLOW UP --

37:25.509 --> 37:26.644
>> DATED AND ASSASSINATIONS ALSO

37:26.711 --> 37:31.248
OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE

37:31.315 --> 37:31.716
BRITISH PARLIAMENT.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.217
BOMBINGS IN CITIES AND

37:33.284 --> 37:36.487
EVENTUALLY, THIS WAS KIND OF

37:36.554 --> 37:38.489
STOPPED BY A BIG CIVIL RIGHTS

37:38.556 --> 37:39.457
EQUIVALENT MOVEMENT.

37:39.523 --> 37:40.591
BASICALLY WOMEN GETTING ON THE

37:40.658 --> 37:41.626
STREETS AND PROTESTING ABOUT

37:41.692 --> 37:42.293
WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.862
BUT FOR SOME GROWING UP THERE,

37:44.929 --> 37:45.830
YOU COULDN'T LEAVE BASICALLY A

37:45.896 --> 37:47.298
BAG IN THE STREET BECAUSE PEOPLE

37:47.365 --> 37:49.400
THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A BOMB IN

37:49.467 --> 37:49.767
IT.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.002
I HAD FRIENDS WHO LEFT A CAR

37:51.068 --> 37:53.337
PARKED SOMEWHERE AND IT WOULD BE

37:53.404 --> 37:54.338
BLOWN UP BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE SO

37:54.405 --> 37:56.707
PARANOID AND ON EDGE OF THE

37:56.774 --> 37:57.008
WHOLE TIME.

37:57.074 --> 37:58.109
LOOK, IT IS BASICALLY LIKE WE

37:58.175 --> 37:58.542
ARE RIGHT NOW.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.511
WE LOOK AT SOMEONE, WE

38:00.578 --> 38:02.346
IMMEDIATELY GET SUSPICIOUS ABOUT

38:02.413 --> 38:03.714
ARE THEY ON THE OTHER SIDE?

38:03.781 --> 38:05.950
SOME GROWING UP, YOU WOULD NEED

38:06.017 --> 38:07.118
AN IRISHMAN OR A CATHOLIC AND

38:07.184 --> 38:09.353
YOU WOULD THINK, ARE YOU IN THE

38:09.420 --> 38:10.054
IRA?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.255
ARE YOU A SYMPATHIZER?

38:11.322 --> 38:12.423
BUT IN ACTUALITY THE IRA WAS

38:12.490 --> 38:15.092
ACTUALLY ONLY 400 PEOPLE.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.093
WE THINK ABOUT INTERCOMMUNAL

38:16.160 --> 38:16.727
VIOLENCE WE THINK ABOUT

38:16.794 --> 38:17.561
MILITIAS.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.729
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT

38:18.796 --> 38:19.330
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

38:19.397 --> 38:23.134
WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT A FEW

38:23.200 --> 38:25.770
HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO ARE THAT

38:25.836 --> 38:26.037
MOTIVATED.

38:26.103 --> 38:26.637
>> Bill: THE IRISH REPUBLICAN

38:26.704 --> 38:28.105
ARMY WAS ONLY 400 PEOPLE?

38:28.172 --> 38:30.708
>> IT WAS ONLY AROUND THAT, THE

38:30.775 --> 38:31.075
REAL HARD-CORE.

38:31.142 --> 38:31.976
>> Bill: THE PEOPLE WHO

38:32.043 --> 38:33.744
ACTUALLY DID THE VIOLENCE.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.846
THE POLITICAL RING WAS MUCH

38:35.913 --> 38:36.647
LARGER WHO SUPPORTED THEM.

38:36.714 --> 38:36.947
>> CORRECT.

38:37.014 --> 38:39.817
SO YOU CAN HAVE A BIG POOL OF

38:39.884 --> 38:41.519
SYMPATHIZERS OR PEOPLE WHO

38:41.585 --> 38:42.319
ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THAT IRELAND

38:42.386 --> 38:43.120
SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNITED INTO

38:43.187 --> 38:44.755
DEPENDENT BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING

38:44.822 --> 38:45.523
TO BE THE PEOPLE PERPETRATING

38:45.589 --> 38:47.425
THE VIOLENCE.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.326
>> Bill: LIKE TERRORISTS,

38:49.393 --> 38:50.261
ISLAMIC TERRORISTS OR ISLAMISTS.

38:50.327 --> 38:52.096
>> EXACTLY, BIG DIFFERENCE.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.098
>> Bill: YES BUT ISLAMISTS ARE

38:54.165 --> 38:54.865
GENERALLY PEOPLE WHO WOULD

38:54.932 --> 38:55.533
APPLAUD WITH THE TERRACE ARE

38:55.599 --> 38:57.301
DOING BUT THEY

38:57.368 --> 38:58.035
WOULDN'T --

38:58.102 --> 39:00.204
>> NECESSARILY DO IT THEMSELVES.

39:00.271 --> 39:00.905
RIGHT.

39:00.971 --> 39:02.540
>> Bill: YOU ARE SAYING YOU

39:02.606 --> 39:04.375
DON'T NEED A OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

39:04.442 --> 39:05.743
TO DO IT.

39:05.810 --> 39:11.115
>> IT WENT ON FOR A DECADE

39:11.182 --> 39:12.516
BEFORE, THERE WAS A MOVEMENT

39:12.583 --> 39:13.417
FROM THE GRASSROOTS TO TRY TO

39:13.484 --> 39:13.651
STOP IT.

39:13.718 --> 39:16.520
>> I THINK WE NEED TO BE IN

39:16.587 --> 39:18.723
BETTER SHAPE THAN THEY ARE

39:18.789 --> 39:18.989
CURRENTLY.

39:19.056 --> 39:19.323
>> Bill: WHO?

39:19.390 --> 39:21.358
>> THE U.S. DOMESTIC TERRORIST

39:21.425 --> 39:25.296
WHO ARE DOING THE NEXT SECRETARY

39:25.362 --> 39:27.064
AND TROUBLES IN THE

39:27.131 --> 39:27.398
UNITED STATES.

39:27.465 --> 39:27.698
>> Bill: OH.

39:27.765 --> 39:27.932
[LAUGHS]

39:27.998 --> 39:31.435
>> PEOPLE ARE NOT THAT MOTIVATED

39:31.502 --> 39:31.936
I THINK HERE.

39:32.002 --> 39:33.137
WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET

39:33.204 --> 39:33.971
YOU DON'T SEE SOMEONE WHO IS

39:34.038 --> 39:36.307
READY FOR POLITICAL VIOLENCE.

39:36.373 --> 39:37.742
OR TO CHEER IT ON FROM THE

39:37.808 --> 39:38.709
SIDELINES.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.311
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE THAT

39:40.377 --> 39:41.145
EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN IT.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.514
ESPECIALLY AFTER 22 MONTHS OF

39:43.581 --> 39:44.949
THE PANDEMIC, YOU ARE

39:45.015 --> 39:45.649
EMOTIONALLY INVESTED TO SURVIVE

39:45.716 --> 39:47.017
THE DAY AND GETTING YOUR KID

39:47.084 --> 39:48.686
INTO SCHOOL MORE THAN JUST ABOUT

39:48.753 --> 39:49.787
ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS GOING ON.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.422
>> BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE

39:51.489 --> 39:52.289
CIRCUMSTANCE.

39:52.356 --> 39:53.724
THINK ABOUT JANUARY 6TH.

39:53.791 --> 39:56.927
NOT EVERYBODY WHO SHOWED UP AT

39:56.994 --> 40:01.332
TRUMP'S RALLY THEN STORMED THE

40:01.398 --> 40:02.233
CAPITOL BUILDING.

40:02.299 --> 40:04.602
>> BUT THEY WERE MOTIVATED AND

40:04.668 --> 40:05.269
WEIRD WAYS.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.037
IT'S TRUE.

40:07.104 --> 40:07.304
[APPLAUSE]

40:07.371 --> 40:07.938
BUT SEE HOW DESPERATELY BAD THE

40:08.005 --> 40:08.339
ORGANIZATION WAS.

40:08.405 --> 40:11.542
IF YOU READ THE AFFIDAVIT OF

40:11.609 --> 40:13.310
THEIR COMPLAINT, ON THE GUYS WHO

40:13.377 --> 40:15.179
ARE NOW UP AGAINST INSURRECTION

40:15.246 --> 40:15.913
CHARGES, IT'S A PRETTY PATHETIC

40:15.980 --> 40:16.914
DAY THAT THEY HAD.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.582
THEY WERE LIKE ALL RIGHT, DO YOU

40:18.649 --> 40:19.850
HAVE A BOAT TO GO ACROSS THE

40:19.917 --> 40:21.051
RIVER HERE?

40:21.118 --> 40:22.253
GOSH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

40:22.319 --> 40:23.120
THEY WERE NOT COORDINATING WELL,

40:23.187 --> 40:24.421
THEY WERE NOT ORGANIZED AND THEY

40:24.488 --> 40:27.224
WERE THE SCARIEST BIT OF A VERY,

40:27.291 --> 40:28.092
VERY SCARY AND TROUBLING DAY.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.262
WHAT I WONDER IS IS THAT DAY THE

40:31.328 --> 40:32.062
BEGINNING OF SOMETHING NEW?

40:32.129 --> 40:34.131
DO YOU NOTICE PEOPLE GO THOSE

40:34.198 --> 40:35.232
PEOPLE LOOK GREAT TO ME, THEY

40:35.299 --> 40:36.967
WERE REALLY ON THE CUTTING EDGE

40:37.034 --> 40:37.601
OF SOMETHING.

40:37.668 --> 40:38.736
OR DO PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT AND

40:38.803 --> 40:39.637
GET A LITTLE BIT SCARED

40:39.703 --> 40:40.704
STRAIGHT.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.641
LIKE MY GOD, WHAT DID WE DO ON

40:43.707 --> 40:44.241
THAT DAY?

40:44.308 --> 40:46.043
>> Bill: OKAY, LET ME MOVE ON

40:46.110 --> 40:47.077
TO THE COURT BECAUSE I THINK

40:47.144 --> 40:48.312
THIS IS A VERY HISTORIC WEEK.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.781
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE FIRST

40:50.848 --> 40:51.182
BLACK WOMAN ON THE

40:51.248 --> 40:51.515
SUPREME COURT.

40:51.582 --> 40:53.584
[APPLAUSE]

40:53.651 --> 40:58.889
THAT IS PRETTY BIG STUFF.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.090
IT'S ALSO THE WEEK WE LEARNED

41:00.157 --> 41:01.826
THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING

41:01.892 --> 41:04.662
TO TAKE UP WHETHER WE SHOULD

41:04.728 --> 41:07.331
HAVE, CONSIDER RACE IN

41:07.398 --> 41:07.832
ADMISSIONS.

41:07.898 --> 41:09.400
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PROPONENT OF

41:09.466 --> 41:10.935
WHAT THEY CALL AFFIRMATIVE

41:11.001 --> 41:12.303
ACTION AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF

41:12.369 --> 41:13.671
THEY USE THAT TERM ANYMORE PEER

41:13.737 --> 41:15.539
BUT I DON'T KNOW, IT'S BEEN A

41:15.606 --> 41:16.507
LONG TIME.

41:16.574 --> 41:17.174
MAYBE IT'S OUTDATED BECAUSE WHEN

41:17.241 --> 41:22.646
I LOOK AT THE POLLING, 73% OF

41:22.713 --> 41:24.281
AMERICANS SAY COLLEGE AND

41:24.348 --> 41:25.783
UNIVERSITIES SHOULD NOT USE RACE

41:25.850 --> 41:28.552
AS A FACTOR IN ADMISSIONS.

41:28.619 --> 41:29.119
62% OF BLACK AMERICANS AGREE

41:29.186 --> 41:30.487
WITH THAT.

41:30.554 --> 41:33.390
I FIND IT WEIRD TO BE MORE ON

41:33.457 --> 41:34.925
THE SIDE OF SOMETHING BLACK

41:34.992 --> 41:37.294
PEOPLE THEMSELVES ARE NOT.

41:37.361 --> 41:39.163
>> I MEAN, I THINK IT'S

41:39.230 --> 41:40.130
IMPORTANT TO WORK BACKWARDS A

41:40.197 --> 41:41.198
LITTLE BIT OR START WITH THE

41:41.265 --> 41:42.533
FIRST QUESTION, WHAT ARE WE

41:42.600 --> 41:42.933
TRYING TO DO HERE?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.836
IF THE IDEA IS WE ARE TRYING TO

41:45.903 --> 41:47.638
REDUCE THE BARRIERS TO PEOPLE

41:47.705 --> 41:48.973
WHO HAD THROUGH NO FAULT OF

41:49.039 --> 41:50.174
THEIR OWN DISADVANTAGES, WHAT IS

41:50.241 --> 41:50.608
THE WAY TO DO THAT?

41:50.674 --> 41:55.779
IS IT TO TRY TO START JUDGING,

41:55.846 --> 41:57.314
DO YOU BELONG TO THIS CATEGORY

41:57.381 --> 41:58.015
CALLED ASIAN OR BLACK AND

41:58.082 --> 42:00.885
SOMETIMES BASED ON SOME PRETTY

42:00.951 --> 42:02.353
WEIRD TESTS, OR DO YOU COME FROM

42:02.419 --> 42:02.987
A SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND THAT

42:03.053 --> 42:04.889
IS HAVING A HARD TIME?

42:04.955 --> 42:07.358
THAT IS HOW THEY DO IT IN

42:07.424 --> 42:08.058
OXFORD, IT'S A SOCIOECONOMIC

42:08.125 --> 42:09.693
THING, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

42:09.760 --> 42:10.895
RACE AND A KIND OF WORKS A LOT

42:10.961 --> 42:11.228
BETTER.

42:11.295 --> 42:12.296
IF HE DID THAT, AND AT HARVARD

42:12.363 --> 42:15.266
AND OTHER PLACES, GOT RID OF

42:15.332 --> 42:16.967
LEGACIES.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.570
THE 1 OUT OF 3 PEOPLE WHO ARE

42:19.637 --> 42:20.204
ADMITTED BECAUSE DADDY OR MOMMY

42:20.271 --> 42:21.472
WENT THERE, THAT WOULD DO A HELL

42:21.538 --> 42:22.806
OF A LOT MORE THAN TRYING TO

42:22.873 --> 42:25.342
FIGURE OUT WHETHER A BANGLADESHI

42:25.409 --> 42:26.443
IS THE SAME AS A CHINESE PERSON

42:26.510 --> 42:32.316
IS THE SAME AS A --

42:32.383 --> 42:33.550
>> Bill: ESPECIALLY AS WE

42:33.617 --> 42:34.485
MINGLE AND INTERMARRY MORE IT IS

42:34.551 --> 42:36.353
GOING TO BE HARDER, IT IS

42:36.420 --> 42:38.088
ALREADY HARDER TO SAY WHO IS OF

42:38.155 --> 42:38.422
WHAT RACE.

42:38.489 --> 42:40.090
>> I DO THINK WE HAVE TO BE A

42:40.157 --> 42:40.925
LITTLE BIT CAREFUL ON THIS,

42:40.991 --> 42:42.092
THOUGH AND I WILL SPEAK TO THIS

42:42.159 --> 42:44.361
BECAUSE I DID GO TO HARVARD

42:44.428 --> 42:47.431
FOR GRAD SCHOOL AND IT WAS

42:47.498 --> 42:48.065
ACTUALLY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

42:48.132 --> 42:49.700
I'M OBVIOUSLY WHITE BUT BECAUSE

42:49.767 --> 42:50.401
I CAME FROM A VERY POOR

42:50.467 --> 42:54.171
SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND, AND

42:54.238 --> 42:55.439
WHEN I WAS BEING SELECTED FOR

42:55.506 --> 42:56.106
GRAD SCHOOL PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE

42:56.173 --> 42:58.609
ON THE SCHOLARSHIPS FROM THE

42:58.676 --> 42:59.576
U.K. WENT TO OXFORD AND

42:59.643 --> 43:00.511
CAMBRIDGE.

43:00.577 --> 43:01.278
NO OFFENSE TO OXFORD AND

43:01.345 --> 43:03.314
CAMBRIDGE BUT THEY ALL BASICALLY

43:03.380 --> 43:04.682
CAME FROM PRIVATE SCHOOLS.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.317
ONE OTHER EXCEPTION BEER BUT I

43:06.383 --> 43:07.051
WAS THE ONLY

43:07.117 --> 43:08.052
KID BASICALLY UP TO THAT POINT

43:08.118 --> 43:09.720
THAT WAS SELECTED FOR THESE

43:09.787 --> 43:11.588
SCHOLARSHIPS TO COME FROM A POOR

43:11.655 --> 43:13.324
BACKGROUND AND FROM A VERY UNDER

43:13.390 --> 43:14.024
RESOURCED SCHOOL.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.160
AND SO I WAS VERY GRATEFUL THAT

43:16.226 --> 43:17.027
HARVARD ACTUALLY MADE THE EXTRA

43:17.094 --> 43:18.762
EFFORT TO SEEK ME OUT.

43:18.829 --> 43:20.698
AND WHAT I SAW WHEN I WAS THERE

43:20.764 --> 43:21.598
WAS THAT WAS JUST ONE FACTOR.

43:21.665 --> 43:24.134
I THINK THE SOCIOECONOMIC

43:24.201 --> 43:26.036
ASPECTS, THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT

43:26.103 --> 43:26.236
TOO.

43:26.303 --> 43:27.805
WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE

43:27.871 --> 43:28.706
SUPREME COURT WHICH IS VERY

43:28.772 --> 43:29.707
INTERESTING, THEY ARE LOCKING

43:29.773 --> 43:32.009
INTO THE SELECTION RIGHT NOW,

43:32.076 --> 43:33.777
ONE OF THE CANDIDATES THAT BIDEN

43:33.844 --> 43:34.778
IS APPARENTLY CONSIDERING FOR

43:34.845 --> 43:37.614
THE SUPREME COURT IS A BLACK

43:37.681 --> 43:39.049
WOMAN FROM A POOR SOCIOECONOMIC

43:39.116 --> 43:41.318
BACKGROUND WHO WENT TO A

43:41.385 --> 43:42.886
NONIVY LEAGUE SCHOOL.

43:42.953 --> 43:43.654
>> OH, REALLY?

43:43.721 --> 43:45.322
>> SO I THINK ALL THOSE FACTORS

43:45.389 --> 43:45.923
NEED TO BE CONSIDERED BECAUSE

43:45.990 --> 43:47.491
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF PEOPLE

43:47.558 --> 43:48.058
GETTING AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

43:48.125 --> 43:51.729
BECAUSE OF HOW THEY LOOK OR WHAT

43:51.795 --> 43:53.397
THEIR ETHNICITY OR RACE IS, BUT

43:53.464 --> 43:55.466
IT IS GETTING RID OF UNFAIR

43:55.532 --> 43:55.799
DISADVANTAGE.

43:55.866 --> 43:56.066
[APPLAUSE]

43:56.133 --> 43:57.368
>> ONE OF THE UNFAIR

43:57.434 --> 43:57.968
DISADVANTAGES UNDERLYING THE

43:58.035 --> 44:00.204
HARVARD CASE, IT'S JUST AGAINST

44:00.270 --> 44:02.806
ASIANS.

44:02.873 --> 44:04.041
>> Bill: IT'S ABOUT ASIANS,

44:04.108 --> 44:06.243
AND BOY, THEY HAVE DONE THEM

44:06.310 --> 44:06.810
SOME DIRTY.

44:06.877 --> 44:09.713
BECAUSE ASIANS, YOU KNOW, THEY

44:09.780 --> 44:10.748
STUDY HARD, WHATEVER IT IS, I

44:10.814 --> 44:13.083
DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY DO VERY

44:13.150 --> 44:14.418
WELL.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.853
SO WELL THAT HARVARD BASICALLY

44:15.919 --> 44:17.321
WENT BACK DOOR TO MAKE SURE THAT

44:17.388 --> 44:20.057
THEY DIDN'T BASICALLY DOMINATE

44:20.124 --> 44:20.491
THE INCOMING CLASS.

44:20.557 --> 44:23.761
SO THEY WENT TO SOMETHING ON THE

44:23.827 --> 44:25.229
TEST CALLED POSITIVE

44:25.295 --> 44:25.729
PERSONALITY.

44:25.796 --> 44:27.898
SO THEY ARE GOING TO JUDGE YOU

44:27.965 --> 44:29.433
ALSO ON YOUR PERSONALITY AND

44:29.500 --> 44:31.802
THEY JUDGED ASIANS WERE LACKING

44:31.869 --> 44:33.504
IN LIKABILITY, AND THESE ARE

44:33.570 --> 44:35.706
BASICALLY, THEY ARE JUDGING

44:35.773 --> 44:37.908
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

44:37.975 --> 44:39.610
LIKABILITY, COURAGE, KINDNESS,

44:39.676 --> 44:41.111
AND BEING WIDELY RESPECTED.

44:41.178 --> 44:42.780
OH, YES, BECAUSE I REMEMBER

44:42.846 --> 44:44.214
BEING WIDELY RESPECTED IN

44:44.281 --> 44:45.349
HIGH SCHOOL.

44:45.416 --> 44:45.616
[LAUGHTER]

44:45.682 --> 44:49.086
[APPLAUSE]

44:49.153 --> 44:52.489
>> THEY USE TESTS LIKE THAT IN

44:52.556 --> 44:53.791
THE 1920s AT HARVARD AND OTHER

44:53.857 --> 44:56.660
ELITE SCHOOLS TO LIMIT THE

44:56.727 --> 45:05.135
NUMBERS OF JEWS.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.503
THEY ARE SAYING, ARE THERE TOO

45:06.570 --> 45:08.439
MANY ASIANS, WE HAVE TO DO

45:08.505 --> 45:10.074
SOMETHING PEER THAT IS

45:10.140 --> 45:10.908
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ASIANS.

45:10.974 --> 45:13.377
>> Bill: THANK YOU, YOU ARE

45:13.444 --> 45:13.577
GREAT.

45:13.644 --> 45:16.313
IT IS TIME FOR "NEW RULES."

45:16.380 --> 45:20.851
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

45:28.058 --> 45:29.426

45:31.762 --> 45:32.729
RUN HITTER, LET HIM IN THE HALL.

BARBARIC, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

48:09.119 --> 48:10.320
OF SPECIAL, BECAUSE IT MEANS

48:22.933 --> 48:24.668
>> THEY NEED TO WATCH WHAT THEY

48:24.735 --> 48:25.736
SAY AND WATCH WHAT THEY DO AND

48:25.802 --> 48:28.171
IT'S NOT A TIME FOR REMARKS LIKE

48:28.238 --> 48:31.642
THAT, IT NEVER IS.

THAT TO WONDERING IF I SHOULD

48:35.178 --> 48:35.979
RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

48:36.046 --> 48:38.749
>> WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE

48:38.815 --> 48:39.850
IF BILL MAHER IS RECRUITED TO

48:39.916 --> 48:42.886
RUN FOR PRESIDENCY.

48:42.953 --> 48:45.055
>> Bill: NOW, SOME PEOPLE

48:45.122 --> 48:46.123
THINK THIS MEANS I'VE CHANGED.

48:46.189 --> 48:47.291
I ASSURE YOU I HAVE NOT.

48:47.357 --> 48:48.725
I'M STILL THE SAME UNMARRIED,

48:48.792 --> 48:50.027
CHILDLESS, POT-SMOKING LIBERTINE

48:50.093 --> 48:53.063
I ALWAYS WAS.

48:53.130 --> 48:58.101
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:58.168 --> 48:59.803

48:59.870 --> 49:03.106
ACCUSE ME OF MATURING.

49:03.173 --> 49:08.645
[LAUGHTER]

49:08.712 --> 49:10.147
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT, IT'S

49:10.213 --> 49:12.649
NOT ME WHO'S CHANGED, IT'S THE

49:12.716 --> 49:14.051
LEFT, WHO IS NOW MADE UP OF A

49:14.117 --> 49:15.752
SMALL CONTINGENT WHO'VE GONE

49:15.819 --> 49:17.854
MENTAL, AND A LARGE CONTINGENT

49:17.921 --> 49:18.488
WHO REFUSE TO CALL THEM OUT FOR

49:18.555 --> 49:19.256
IT.

49:19.323 --> 49:20.857
BUT I WILL.

49:20.924 --> 49:25.262
THAT'S WHY I'M A HERO AT FOX

49:25.329 --> 49:28.565
THESE DAYS.

49:28.632 --> 49:31.802
[APPLAUSE]

49:31.868 --> 49:32.703
WHICH SHOWS JUST HOW MUCH

49:32.769 --> 49:33.904
LIBERALS HAVE THEIR HEAD UP

49:33.970 --> 49:35.172
THEIR ASS, BECAUSE IF THEY

49:35.238 --> 49:36.206
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THEY

49:36.273 --> 49:37.307
WOULD HAVE MADE ME A HERO ON

49:37.374 --> 49:39.643
THEIR MEDIA.

49:39.710 --> 49:41.044
[APPLAUSE]

49:41.111 --> 49:42.412
BUT THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IN THIS

49:42.479 --> 49:44.214
RIDICULOUS NEW ERA OF

49:44.281 --> 49:45.282
MIND-NUMBING PARTISANSHIP, WHERE

49:45.349 --> 49:46.416
IF I KEEP IT REAL ABOUT THE

49:46.483 --> 49:48.051
NONSENSE IN THE DEMOCRATIC

49:48.118 --> 49:48.652
PARTY, IT MAKES ME AN INSTANT

49:48.719 --> 49:50.420
HERO TO REPUBLICANS.

49:50.487 --> 49:52.923
THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN

49:52.989 --> 49:56.727
REVERSE TO DARTH VADER'S

49:56.793 --> 49:58.829
DAUGHTER, LIZ CHENEY, WHO IS NOW

49:58.895 --> 50:00.464
A HERO TO LIBERALS SIMPLY

50:00.530 --> 50:03.734
BECAUSE SHE RECOGNIZES BIDEN

50:03.800 --> 50:05.135
DID NOT STEAL THE LAST ELECTION.

50:05.202 --> 50:06.737
WHAT A SAD COMMENTARY ON OUR

50:06.803 --> 50:08.472
POLITICS, WHERE SIMPLY

50:08.538 --> 50:09.639
ACKNOWLEDGING REALITY IS NOW

50:09.706 --> 50:13.610
SEEN AS A PROFILE IN COURAGE.

50:13.677 --> 50:15.278
PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY TO ME, "YOU

50:15.345 --> 50:16.446
DIDN'T USED TO MAKE FUN OF THE

50:16.513 --> 50:18.315
LEFT AS MUCH."

50:18.382 --> 50:19.750
YEAH, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GIVE

50:19.816 --> 50:24.354
ME SO MUCH TO WORK WITH.

50:24.421 --> 50:29.926
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:29.993 --> 50:33.363
THE OATH OF OFFICE I TOOK WAS TO

50:33.430 --> 50:35.499
COMEDY, AND IF YOU DO GOOFY

50:35.565 --> 50:36.566
SHIT, WHEREVER YOU ARE ON THE

50:36.633 --> 50:37.601
SPECTRUM, I'M GOING TO MAKE FUN

50:37.667 --> 50:39.970
OF YOU BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

50:40.036 --> 50:41.405
GOLD IS, AND THE FACT THAT THEY

50:41.471 --> 50:48.512
ARE LAUGHING AT IT SHOULD TELL

50:48.578 --> 50:53.784
YOU SOMETHING: IT RINGS TRUE.

50:53.850 --> 50:55.886
[APPLAUSE]

50:55.952 --> 50:59.022
WHEN NORMAL PEOPLE READ THAT

50:59.089 --> 51:02.759
SAN FRANCISCO HAS BASICALLY

51:02.826 --> 51:04.161
LEGALIZED SHOPLIFTING, THEY

51:04.227 --> 51:06.797
THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE NUTS.

51:06.863 --> 51:09.866
THEY THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT TED

51:09.933 --> 51:12.569
CRUZ GUY SEEMS LIKE A REAL STIF

51:12.636 --> 51:12.769
STIFF.

51:12.836 --> 51:14.504
BUT AT LEAST HE BELIEVES IN THE

51:14.571 --> 51:17.908
CONCEPT OF SHOPPING WITH MONEY.

THAT THE PARTY OF FDR AND JFK IS

51:27.717 --> 51:32.689
TURNING INTO THE PARTY OF LOL

51:32.756 --> 51:34.891
AND WTF.

51:34.958 --> 51:37.994
[APPLAUSE]

51:38.061 --> 51:40.096
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TWEETING

51:40.163 --> 51:43.600
THINGS LIKE CANCEL RENT, CANCEL

51:43.667 --> 51:44.234
MORTGAGE, AND NO MORE POLICING

51:44.301 --> 51:49.105
OR INCARCERATION, DECLARING THAT

51:49.172 --> 51:52.075
CAPITALISM IS SLAVERY, CANCELING

51:52.142 --> 51:53.977
LINCOLN AND DR. SEUSS, TEACHING

51:54.044 --> 51:56.146
CHILDREN THEIR OPPRESSORS AND

51:56.213 --> 51:57.013

51:57.080 --> 52:00.750
MR. POTATO HEAD GENDER NEUTRAL,

52:00.817 --> 52:07.424
AND NOW A EMOJI FOR PREGNANT

52:07.491 --> 52:08.859
MEN.

52:08.925 --> 52:11.495
REAL, I'M NOT MAKING IT UP.

52:11.561 --> 52:12.629
[LAUGHTER]

52:12.696 --> 52:14.030
CALIFORNIA JUST PASSED A LAW

52:14.097 --> 52:16.366
REQUIRING LARGE RETAILERS TO

52:16.433 --> 52:21.071
HAVE A NONGENDERED TOY SECTION.

52:21.137 --> 52:22.105
A NON-GENDERED TOY SECTION?

52:22.172 --> 52:25.408
ISN'T KEN ENOUGH?

52:25.475 --> 52:31.214
[LAUGHTER]

52:31.281 --> 52:33.183
WE NEED A LAW FOR THAT?

52:33.250 --> 52:34.150
DO YOU HAVE TO INJECT YOURSELVES

52:34.217 --> 52:36.786
INTO EVERYTHING, FROM WHERE YOU

52:36.853 --> 52:37.821
CAN THROW A FRISBEE, TO WHO CAN

52:37.888 --> 52:39.956
BRAID HAIR?

52:40.023 --> 52:41.324
THIS IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WERE

52:41.391 --> 52:42.092
TRIGGERED BY COVID POLICIES,

52:42.158 --> 52:44.594
THEY WERE ALREADY SICK OF RULES.

52:44.661 --> 52:46.096
REGULATION SHOULD BE A GOOD

52:46.162 --> 52:47.464
ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS, IT'S

52:47.531 --> 52:48.131
CERTAINLY ONE THEY'RE ASSOCIATED

52:48.198 --> 52:50.400
WITH.

52:50.467 --> 52:52.302
AND I THINK THE AVERAGE VOTER

52:52.369 --> 52:53.737
WOULD AGREE THAT BANKS AND

52:53.803 --> 52:55.105
CHEMICAL PLANTS AND DRUG

52:55.171 --> 52:58.575
COMPANIES NEED WATCHING.

52:58.642 --> 53:00.210
TELLING A COMPANY "YOU CAN'T

53:00.277 --> 53:01.177
DUMP THE WASTE FROM YOUR HOG

53:01.244 --> 53:03.179

53:03.947 --> 53:06.616
THAT.

53:06.683 --> 53:08.518
BUT DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME A

53:08.585 --> 53:09.786
PARODY OF THEMSELVES, JUST

53:09.853 --> 53:11.788
MAKING RULES TO MAKE RULES,

53:11.855 --> 53:12.522
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE

53:12.589 --> 53:15.158
YOU'RE A BETTER PERSON.

53:15.225 --> 53:20.330
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING BAD

53:20.397 --> 53:21.064
"NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN," WHICH YOU

53:21.131 --> 53:22.032
CAN NEVER FULLY DO, IT JUST

53:22.098 --> 53:23.533
MAKES EVERYONE ELSE'S LIFE A

53:23.600 --> 53:24.401
DRAG.

53:24.467 --> 53:26.670
THE BIDEN INFRASTRUCTURE HAS A

53:26.736 --> 53:28.538
PROVISION THAT REQUIRES ALL NEW

53:28.605 --> 53:29.839
CARS TO INSTALL AN ALERT SYSTEM

53:29.906 --> 53:32.409
THAT GOES OFF WHEN YOU LEAVE A

53:32.475 --> 53:35.011

53:35.078 --> 53:37.447
SOMETHING DONE ONLY BY

CRACKHEADS AND PEOPLE WHO SADLY,

53:38.148 --> 53:40.183
YES, DO IT ON PURPOSE.

53:40.250 --> 53:42.152
AND AFTER EVERYONE OF US WINDS

53:42.218 --> 53:46.623
UP BEARING THE COST FOR CARS TO

53:46.690 --> 53:48.358
INSTALL THIS ALARM, YOU KNOW

53:48.425 --> 53:49.759
WHO'S GOING TO IGNORE IT?

53:49.826 --> 53:50.393

ON PURPOSE.

54:01.171 --> 54:03.373
A SENSOR LIGHT IS NOT GOING TO

54:03.440 --> 54:04.908
FIX THIS PROBLEM, AND DEMOCRATS

54:04.975 --> 54:06.509
NO LONGER POSSESS THE COMMON

54:06.576 --> 54:08.345
SENSE TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT

54:08.411 --> 54:09.713
EVERY PROBLEM IN THE WORLD CAN

54:09.779 --> 54:12.749
BE FIXED WITH A REGULATION.

54:12.816 --> 54:13.817
BUT DON'T TELL THAT TO THE

54:13.883 --> 54:15.518
ADVOCACY GROUPS WHO ALSO WANT

54:15.585 --> 54:17.520
EVERY FUTURE CAR IN AMERICA TO

54:17.587 --> 54:18.622
ONLY START WHEN THE DRIVER BLOWS

SAFE TO DRIVE WHEN YOU'RE

54:36.573 --> 54:39.676
CRYING.

54:39.743 --> 54:41.111
SHOULD WE MAKE A CAR THAT

54:41.177 --> 54:45.882
FOLLOWS YOUR TEXTS AND STOPS THE

54:45.949 --> 54:50.987

TO LIVE IN, AND NOT JUST ANY

55:25.755 --> 55:26.823

55:43.073 --> 55:44.574
IS TO BE HASSLED.
