00:02.360 --> 00:03.349
<i>Let me explain.</i>

00:03.440 --> 00:06.591
<i>Turk and Carla's marriage</i>
<i>was in trouble cos of some dumb stuff</i>

00:06.680 --> 00:10.593
<i>Turk had done, so last night,</i>
<i>I took Carla out to smooth things over.</i>

00:11.520 --> 00:13.670
<i>Long story short, we smooched.</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:17.748
Sorry. Drunken accident.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.869
<i>It was barely more than a friend kiss,</i>
<i>so we decided not to tell Turk.</i>

00:22.960 --> 00:24.598
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

00:24.680 --> 00:26.910
J.D. And I kissed.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.829
<i>Was it a comfortable silence? No.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna be the one who breaks it.</i>

00:30.920 --> 00:33.992
<i>Unfortunately, I have one of</i>
<i>Rowdy's hairs in my mouth.</i>

00:36.960 --> 00:39.997
<i>I guess there's a lot of things</i>
<i>that can knock you on your arse.</i>

00:40.320 --> 00:43.517
<i>For instance, when your 17-year-old</i>
<i>neighbour doesn't see you</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:45.033
<i>as a smoking hottie anymore.</i>

00:45.120 --> 00:46.951
Pedro?

00:48.160 --> 00:50.628
I can't seem to find my pencil.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.995
Do you have any idea where it might be?

00:53.720 --> 00:56.234
It's right there between
your bosoms... ma'am.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.309
Ma'am?

00:57.400 --> 01:00.233
You just ma'amed your way
out of me buying you beer again.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.357
Ma'am?

01:06.320 --> 01:08.914
<i>And, of course, the one thing</i>
<i>you can always count on</i>

01:09.000 --> 01:10.399
<i>to knock you on your arse...</i>

01:11.760 --> 01:12.875
<i>Floor wax.</i>

01:13.480 --> 01:15.152
Uncanny.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.832
Dr Kelso, while I got you here,

01:16.920 --> 01:19.673
I need to discuss
a matter of grave importance.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.399
- What is it?
- I'm not happy with my uniform.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.833
New janitor uniforms! Top priority.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.754
Right up there with silk jammies for
the patients and a cat door for the ICU.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.876
I made some sketches.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.715
- This one has a cape!
- Gives me the option of fighting crime.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.873
After work, of course.

01:37.960 --> 01:41.032
Now, this one has sort of
a medieval thing goin'.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.028
- That's you on a horse?
- It's a steed, sir.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.111
That's for clean-ups in outer space.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.435
This one's...
outer space evening wear.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.511
This one's just a kangaroo.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.477
Sometimes I draw kangaroos.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.472
You know, I could look at
the demented crayon scratchings

01:58.560 --> 02:01.836
of a madman all day,
but I got a hospital to run.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.391
- Did you wax over there yet?
- No, sir.

02:08.560 --> 02:13.270
I'll get a new uniform,
or I'll wax everything in your world.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.318
Wait'll you get a load of this.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.709
They're giving me
a teaching award tonight

02:18.800 --> 02:21.155
so I'm gonna need you
to holster up the twins,

02:21.240 --> 02:23.356
as you'll be playin'
the role of arm candy.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.477
Yeah, I'm not going.
If I wanna hear someone go on and on

02:26.560 --> 02:29.518
about how great you are,
I'll just listen to you during sex.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.070
I'm hearing the hate,
but I'm not seeing the hate. You...

02:35.720 --> 02:36.948
Oh, my God.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.918
Did you Botox your face
into an expressionless mask?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.877
Pedro called me "ma'am."

02:41.960 --> 02:45.475
Damn it, Jordan, come on.
Now, you know I'm generally OK

02:45.560 --> 02:48.154
with you putting any poison
you want into your body,

02:48.240 --> 02:50.708
but this is the first time
I've ever won anything.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.998
- It's not that bad.
- Really! Show me... happy.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.349
Sad.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.429
Silly. Amused. Bemused. C-mused.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.635
Show me... angry.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.951
You got angry down.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074

<i>When we got to work,</i>
<i>not a whole lot had changed.</i>

03:26.000 --> 03:27.433
<i>The silence was killing me.</i>

03:27.520 --> 03:28.873
You kissed my wife.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.632
<i>I miss the silence.</i>

03:30.720 --> 03:32.153
Did you like it?

03:32.240 --> 03:35.755
Well, it's kind of a trick question.
If I say yes, it's like I'm sayin',

03:35.840 --> 03:38.798
"Dude, your wife is hot,
and I'd like to get me some of that."

03:38.880 --> 03:40.552
But if I say no, then I'm all like,

03:40.640 --> 03:44.030
"I know she's your wife, but
you can keep that fish-lipped bitty."

03:45.160 --> 03:47.276
What about you, Carla?
Did you like it?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.271
No! His lips are chappy.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.316
I can't use lip balm.
I end up eating it.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.868
When I was little,
I used to spread it on crackers.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.436
Well, if it isn't the happy couple.
Oh, and Turk's here, too!

03:59.440 --> 04:01.908
OK. Are we not laughing about this yet?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.594
Turk, look, I'm so sorry,
but you have to believe me.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.194
- It was barely anything.
- It was barely even a kiss.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.794
It was an accidental lip bump,
like, "Oops."

04:10.680 --> 04:14.070
Don't even look at her.
Sit on the floor!

04:14.160 --> 04:17.914
- Sitting.
- Fine. I'll show you with Elliot.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.028
Something wonderful is happening.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.999
I don't understand why you're
butting in on my patient

04:27.080 --> 04:29.548
outside of your usual
arrogance and God complex.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.200
Don't know what
you're talkin' about. Kiss my ring.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.238
However, if you'd like to know
about why I'm "butting in,"

04:35.320 --> 04:37.754
it's because your
young patient Lindsay here,

04:37.840 --> 04:40.877
when she was 10, I'm the one
who diagnosed her with epilepsy.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.157
Now that her medication's
no longer controlling her seizures,

04:44.240 --> 04:45.912
I'd like to know what's going on.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.992
Besides, over the years,
we've developed quite a rapport.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.877
Hey. Lindsay.
What's up, girlfriend?

04:56.560 --> 04:59.552
See? Rapport.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.273
The damn janitor waxed the counter!

05:05.600 --> 05:06.953
Give me that phone.

05:08.720 --> 05:12.156
- It doesn't have to be like this.
- I know.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.873
Here.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.118
It's beautiful.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.351
You don't have to
put it on today, but...

05:27.560 --> 05:30.120
Hey, we're kinda in
the middle of something here!

05:30.200 --> 05:32.191
This'll just take a second.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.636
Nice, huh?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.350
Who gets a tattoo of a mop?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.908
- Can I get up? My butt is asleep.
- No!

05:46.000 --> 05:47.991
Turk, you know how I was so upset

05:48.080 --> 05:50.640
because you started
calling your ex-girlfriend?

05:50.720 --> 05:54.759
I just couldn't understand how a
married person could slip up like that.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.478
Now I do.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.109
- I'm so sorry.
- Me, too, buddy.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.512
Guys... as insane as this may sound,
I'm actually gonna be OK with this.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.994
Just do me a favour. No more apologies.
And no more explanations.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.593
And for the love of God, honey,

06:10.680 --> 06:13.399
no more girl-on-girl
kissing demonstrations.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.190
Something horrible has happened.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.189
I'll tell you why
Lindsay's seizures are back.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.477
Blood work shows her Dilantin's zero.
Not takin' her medicine.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.949
What? I'm gonna
give that girl a talking to.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.952
With all due respect,
Dr Cox, maybe I should talk to her.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.998
With no due respect whatsoever, why?

06:32.080 --> 06:34.548
She's a teenage girl.
That's an awkward time.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.950
You know, your breasts are growing...
Not always symmetrically.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.031
You like boys.
One gives you a ride home.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.715
You think something'll happen,
it doesn't, and that makes it official.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.119
You're a lopsided freak!

06:45.200 --> 06:47.714
Happy ending, though.
Lefty caught up in college.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.789
- Barbie!
- Yeah?

06:48.880 --> 06:52.395
I have a finite amount of brain space,
and your inspiring story

06:52.480 --> 06:55.916
of the little breast who couldn't
just pushed out my memory

06:56.000 --> 06:59.231
of the 1980 Olympic hockey team's
victory at Lake Placid.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.279
Miracle on ice... gone.
Listen to me carefully.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.035
I know all about what it's like
to be a teenage girl.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.914
Of course, I never had to try
to convince my mother

07:11.000 --> 07:12.991
that I sure would've liked a naval ring.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.992
Well, we were all going to Jamaica,
and my friend Susie...

07:20.440 --> 07:22.431
Brain space.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.195
Turk. You've been so awesome,

07:28.280 --> 07:30.999
but we still need you to know
how innocent the kiss was.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.709
- Guys, it's cool. Don't worry about it.
- Just watch, buddy.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.789
See?

07:46.920 --> 07:49.229
Get your hands off my woman!

07:53.760 --> 07:58.390
I think you separated my shoulder.
The pain is excruciating.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.317
What?

08:03.360 --> 08:07.558
- Looking good, Janitor.
- Well, thank you, petite lady.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.359
Wow! That colour
really brings out your package.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.159
Thank you, supposedly straight surgeon.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.071
It's a good day.

08:15.160 --> 08:18.197
Hey, buddy!
That's a great suit!

08:19.360 --> 08:20.952
Don't bunch the new uni.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.119
Little boy blue!
Blow your horn.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.637
He didn't stop.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.072
Stop. Hallway's closed.
Find another way around.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.799
- Whatever. You got somethin' here.
- What?

08:32.919 --> 08:34.477
- What's that?
- I don't know.

08:34.559 --> 08:38.155
You look so cute in your little blue
outfit, I wanted to give you a tickle.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.474
All right, what the hell is goin' on?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.470
Feel free to take notes.
All right, Blossom.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.028
Here's the gossip.
You're having seizures again

08:49.120 --> 08:53.079
cos you're not taking your medication.
If this continues, you'll be dead.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.596
I'm not talking about the "Oh, God,
if I don't get invited to the prom,

08:56.680 --> 08:59.752
I'm going to die" type of dead.
I'm talking dead dead. Clear?

08:59.840 --> 09:03.071
Cos if it's not, I could, of course,
text you on my BlackBerry or

09:03.160 --> 09:04.832
my blueberry or my Chuck Berry.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.150
Technically,
Chuck Berry is a black Berry.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.073
The point is, stop wasting
everybody's time and grow up.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.789
- That clear to you, sweetheart?
- Yes, Dr Cox.

09:13.880 --> 09:17.429
Thattagirl.
Barbie? Feel free to kiss my ring.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.990
<i>It's nice when things</i>
<i>get back to normal.</i>

09:20.080 --> 09:21.354
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Carla.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.954
You gotta try these
sweet potato fries. Amazing.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.632
- Put ketchup on it.
- You got it.

09:45.240 --> 09:48.232
<i>Like I said before,</i>
<i>small things can knock you on your arse.</i>

09:49.720 --> 09:52.951
<i>Whether it's realising that</i>
<i>nobody's afraid of you anymore.</i>

09:54.200 --> 09:56.031
Good Lord!

09:57.240 --> 10:00.835
<i>Or finding out that you have no idea</i>
<i>how to deal with a teenage girl.</i>

10:01.920 --> 10:03.592
Nice work.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.552
<i>The important thing's</i>
<i>to not make a scene in the cafeteria.</i>

10:08.640 --> 10:09.993
Want another one?

10:10.080 --> 10:12.913
- Turk!
- What? What? Were you gonna eat that?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.149
How about this?

10:14.240 --> 10:17.949
Let's all have fries, huh?
Let's all have fries!

10:18.200 --> 10:20.350
- You want fries?
- You said you were OK!

10:20.440 --> 10:21.429
My fries!

10:21.520 --> 10:24.876
Well, apparently I'm not OK,
am I, Carla? Apparently, I'm not!

10:24.960 --> 10:28.157
You know why? Because kisses
just don't happen. They don't.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.073
Now, this is somebody's fault,
and I wanna know whose.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.518
Don't eat that fry!

10:40.560 --> 10:42.630
Admittedly, I lost my cool here.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.188
- No, it's understandable.
- No! Why would you?

10:45.280 --> 10:48.955
I'm sorry, the only way I'm gonna have
closure is if I can blame one of you.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.873
I just gotta figure out who.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.034
Don't worry, this'll all be fine.
You know Turk.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.476
Whomever he blames will get
the silent treatment for a couple days,

11:00.560 --> 11:02.994
then he'll make snarky comments
for a few months.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.275
Sooner or later,
he'll be laughing about it.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.874
Like when I slept with
his family's cleaning lady.

11:08.240 --> 11:11.198
- You slept with Toonie?
- I was staying in their guest room,

11:11.280 --> 11:14.317
she was buffing the nightstand,
and she just kept on buffin'.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.790
- Thanks for takin' the hit on this.
- Me?! You're his best friend.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.997
All you have to do is say, "I'm sorry,"
high-five him, and go...

11:21.080 --> 11:24.311
All you do is have sex and he'll
forgive you. If I have sex with him,

11:24.400 --> 11:27.392
- he'll end up madder.
- Let's not play into his blame game.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.152
Agreed.

11:29.920 --> 11:34.038
Dude, she was pourin' drinks into me,
and she knows I put out when I'm drunk.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.910
He took me to a bar.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.668
I didn't ask him to walk me home!

11:44.600 --> 11:47.751
I'm tellin' you, dude,
she was all over me like ants on candy.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.435
You think you're
talkin' to Turk, don't you? Idiot.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.914
Look, Lindsay, I'm real sorry
if I upset you before. I truly am.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.595
I probably should've asked you
why you stopped taking your medication,

12:00.680 --> 12:02.159
and to be honest with you...

12:02.240 --> 12:05.949
I was hoping you'd be able to give me
the answer to that one right about now.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.992
So... Lindso...

12:11.080 --> 12:15.710
It must be kinda cool having
the same name as that Lindsay Lohan.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.631
Gosh, she's super-cool.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.075
Just between you, me and the IV,

12:20.160 --> 12:23.516
I guess I've probably seen
<i>Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,</i>

12:23.600 --> 12:26.956
oh, I don't know, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine times.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.349
What a film.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.074
That girl... That girl is a robot.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.549
I spent three hours in there
and got goose egg.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.710
It's so odd that
she didn't respond to you

12:39.800 --> 12:42.712
because you know
so much about teenage girls.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.233
All right, look. Barbie...

12:44.320 --> 12:47.198
I'm about to say four words
I've never said to you before,

12:47.280 --> 12:48.633
that I'll never say again.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.439
Go on, get outta here.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.675
I need your help.

12:55.760 --> 13:00.072
Fine. But I have three rules. One,
when we're in the room, you say nothing.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.435
Two, I get to say
whatever I want about you.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.751
Three, if you break rule one or two,
I get to "boing" your curls.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.917
What the hell does "boing" mean?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.832
Boing!

13:14.800 --> 13:16.791
Oh, God, this is gonna kill me.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.799
<i>All right, just put on your mean face,</i>
<i>and order shall be restored.</i>

13:29.520 --> 13:31.112
Yeah, hi. Nut.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.478
What? I don't even know you.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.351
Yeah, yeah. Happy birthday.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.359
You gave me a cursed uniform.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.234
It's not cursed.
It's simply psychology.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.949
I chose robin's-egg blue cos it has a
calming effect on people and I knew

13:57.040 --> 14:00.749
it'd be the thorn in your paw.
Other colours evoke different reactions.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.879
For example, bright orange
has been found to provoke hostility.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.589
Dr Kelso, I want to
thank you again for the tie.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.671
Fist five!

14:13.600 --> 14:15.670
That's the third time today!

14:20.200 --> 14:22.760
Please don't make me
go to this banquet tonight.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.308
Jordan, this award came from my interns.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.630
The least you can do
is show up and support me.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.872
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>it was time for the moment of truth.</i>

14:33.960 --> 14:36.030
- Hey, Turk.
- Hey, Turk.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.235
What's up, J. D?

14:38.520 --> 14:39.953
The silent treatment.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.109
<i>[J.D.] Be gracious.</i>

14:41.200 --> 14:45.239
I got three words for ya.
Sucks to be... Adding a fourth... you.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.549
<i>After sharing a quick victory dance</i>
<i>with Roland, the heavy-set orderly,</i>

14:53.640 --> 14:56.313
<i>who, coincidentally,</i>
<i>was my victory dance coach...</i>

14:56.400 --> 14:57.389
- Pop the hips.
- OK.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.118
- Pop the hips, J.D.
- There it is.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.794
- Thanks, Roland. One day I'll get it.
- I doubt it.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.348
<i>... I got to thinking</i>
<i>about relationships.</i>

15:04.920 --> 15:07.559
<i>About how people fall in love...</i>

15:09.680 --> 15:11.716
<i>... have kids...</i>

15:12.280 --> 15:14.635
<i>... grow old together...</i>

15:15.320 --> 15:17.390
<i>... and say goodbye.</i>

15:18.640 --> 15:21.438
<i>And then, for some reason,</i>
<i>I thought about the circus.</i>

15:22.280 --> 15:24.748
<i>But then I was back on relationships.</i>

15:25.520 --> 15:29.035
Back to your room, Mr Johnson.
You got one ventricle.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.999
<i>I couldn't help thinking maybe it wasn't</i>
<i>luck that made relationships last.</i>

15:33.080 --> 15:35.389
<i>Maybe it was a matter</i>
<i>of who takes fewer hits.</i>

15:35.480 --> 15:39.871
You don't have to talk to me. Just wave
if you're gonna give me a ride home.

15:41.560 --> 15:45.075
<i>And I realised I should've been</i>
<i>the one to take that hit, not Carla.</i>

15:48.720 --> 15:49.709
Hey, Lindsay.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.631
- Don't worry. He's not allowed to talk.
- Is that true?

15:56.160 --> 15:57.957
You may nod.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.476
You know, Lindsay,
when I was 15, I cut my own bangs.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.712
That's right, Percival,
it's a high school hair story.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.555
Anyway, Judy Keenan told me
that she would also cut her hair off.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.108
It was like a suicide pact,
only with bangs.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.839
I cut off my hair,
and of course, she backed out.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.150
But even though my bangs
looked horrible,

16:21.240 --> 16:23.993
I kept them that way,
mostly because those stupid bangs

16:24.080 --> 16:27.038
were the only thing in my life
that I felt I had control over.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.712
You know?

16:28.800 --> 16:31.598
I'm so tired of everyone
telling me what to do.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.513
When to be home, what to wear,
when to take my medicine.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.591
I mean, I'm the one who's sick. Right?

16:36.680 --> 16:38.989
I can handle my own life.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.038
How about I tell your parents
the prescription's will be given

16:42.120 --> 16:45.635
directly to you. You're in charge
of getting your Dilantin, taking it.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.709
Everything.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.314
- Thank you.
- Great.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.354
I don't have a ring,
but you can kiss my arse.

16:53.560 --> 16:57.917
Feared in grey... beautiful in blue.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.912
Feared in grey... beautiful in blue.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.231
I'm gonna grab a fry... some ketchup.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.876
It's cold.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.196
That's it.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.632
I'm back.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.310
That was weird.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.915
No, that was weird.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.311
- What're you doin'?
- That's all it was.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.996
And if you still need someone to blame,
why don't you try blaming yourself?

17:42.200 --> 17:45.192
You're absolutely right.
It's my fault you kissed my wife.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.473
- I'm goin' home.
- Who do you think you're talkin' to?

17:49.560 --> 17:52.552
You think you're the greatest husband?
I was there when you

17:52.640 --> 17:55.757
flirted with your ex and
neglected to tell her you're married.

17:55.840 --> 17:59.389
When you tried to hook up with that
waitress the day before you got engaged.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.870
When you hooked up with that stripper
at Boobies, Boobies, Boobies.

18:02.960 --> 18:03.949
That was you.

18:04.040 --> 18:07.874
I know, but I told her my name was Turk.
Point is, think of the millions of times

18:07.960 --> 18:11.669
you've chosen not to hang with your wife
cos you were tryin' to hang with me.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.194
It's time you started
acting like a real husband

18:14.280 --> 18:17.192
instead of actin' like
some sort of crazy cowboy.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.919
- A cowboy?
- I don't know. It just came to me.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.797
You know I'm right, Turk.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.631
<i>When your pride's at stake,</i>
<i>you can't help but have questions.</i>

18:28.720 --> 18:31.553
Just tell me. How did you know
what was bothering her?

18:31.640 --> 18:34.996
Tell me now so that we don't
have to talk anymore. Ever.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.994
How is it that no man
understands that every woman,

18:38.080 --> 18:41.436
whether she's 16 or 60,
still has that awkward, insecure,

18:41.520 --> 18:44.353
self-conscious teenage girl
inside of her?

18:44.440 --> 18:47.079
<i>A lot of times,</i>
<i>the answer is about sacrifice.</i>

18:50.520 --> 18:54.513
Hey. Look, I was thinkin' maybe...

18:54.600 --> 18:56.955
Maybe you'd rather
just stay in tonight...

18:57.040 --> 18:59.349
You know, have some pizza,
watch some movies.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.429
What do you say?

19:02.880 --> 19:04.279
Are you tryin' to smile?

19:05.920 --> 19:07.911
You're so damn cute.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.959
<i>Sometimes sacrifice is only wearing</i>
<i>your new uni when you're not at work.</i>

19:12.040 --> 19:14.713
OK, how about this one?
Three blue jays fly into a bar.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.995
They say,
"We just want to wet our beaks."

19:18.920 --> 19:21.036
No? Sorry, Dan. You tell one.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.791
<i>Other times, it's about</i>
<i>swallowing that damn pride.</i>

19:26.560 --> 19:28.755
J.D., would you
hand me the wine, please?

19:28.840 --> 19:30.831
Turk's not talkin' to me.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.511
<i>But ultimately, big or small,</i>

19:40.600 --> 19:43.831
<i>sacrifice is about doin' something</i>
<i>you really don't want to do.</i>

19:44.800 --> 19:49.032
Hey, guys, I know we talked about
this before, but... I'm movin' out.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.513
Really?

19:50.600 --> 19:54.832
- Yeah. You guys need your space.
- Wow. Thanks, man.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.196
You're gonna miss me, though.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.430
Hey, you could turn his room into a gym.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.429
We ain't puttin' no gym
in my media room.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.797
- Whose media room?
- Our media room.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.075
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
