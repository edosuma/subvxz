09:47.369 --> 09:50.067
I believe I can solve this.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.853
That is Daniel Skordi,
and according

09:52.896 --> 09:54.855
to my search, there is only one.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.639
Unfortunately, he's deceased.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.946
That's the Dan Skordi
I remember.

09:58.989 --> 10:01.557
I'm sorry he's
no longer with us.SHAMMY: I don't get it.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.167
I thought I knew the guy.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.040
I can't believe he lied to me.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.564
It's not about you.
It's bigger than that.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.305
I mean, he took
a dead vet's identity.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.567
That's stolen valor.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.177
Uh, hang on.
You can't jump to conclusions.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.918
Y-You won't know
until you ask him.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.891
H-Hey. Hey, what's up, guys?

10:30.934 --> 10:32.196
You want to come in?

10:32.240 --> 10:33.981
SHAMMY:
Um, maybe we should

10:34.024 --> 10:35.199
talk out here.

10:37.811 --> 10:41.684
Yeah. What's wrong, Sham?

10:41.728 --> 10:43.381
You sure that's my name?

10:43.425 --> 10:45.993
[laughs softly]

10:46.036 --> 10:47.211
We know you're not
Daniel Skordi.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.518
Why would you say that?

10:49.561 --> 10:51.259
For one thing, he's dead.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.262
You owe me an explanation.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.613
No, I don't owe you anything.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.530
This is stolen valor.

11:01.573 --> 11:04.054
You owe it to everyone
who has ever served.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.930
You don't know what
you're talking about.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.062
Get off my property.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.373
[door closes]

11:28.600 --> 11:31.908
MAGNUM:
Great, no obvious cameras.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.606
So probably no video
of the thieves.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.914
Maybe he saw something.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.699
Doesn't look like he's moving
anytime soon.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.461
I thought you weren't
working on the case.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.463
I'm not.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.422
Magnum's risking a lot
for a criminal,

12:07.465 --> 12:09.250
so I just wanted
to see the extent

12:09.293 --> 12:11.643
of Jason Levner's crimes
and see if it's worth it.

12:11.687 --> 12:15.038
I didn't realize earlier
that it was Jason Levner

12:15.082 --> 12:16.039
you were discussing.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.127
You've heard of him?

12:17.171 --> 12:18.346
[exhales]

12:18.389 --> 12:20.261
His case was big news.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.959
Hedge fund manager
does illegal deal,

12:23.003 --> 12:25.657
loses 43 clients' money,
and goes to jail.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.137
One of my friends
at the cultural center

12:27.181 --> 12:28.312
was one of his victims.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.575
Poor guy lost everything.
Just awful.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.447
Still...

12:32.490 --> 12:36.146
I'm not sure Jason deserves
to die over it.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.061
What's your point?

12:38.105 --> 12:40.063
[sighs]
It's not like you and Magnum

12:40.107 --> 12:42.196
haven't committed felonies
before.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.894
I am pretty sure
it's something else

12:44.938 --> 12:46.722
that's making you
back off the case.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.073
Kumu, I adore you, but I prefer
not to be analyzed.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.248
Okay.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.859
Just... two more cents?

12:54.121 --> 12:58.386
You and Magnum are
better as a team.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.388
A man's life is at stake,

13:00.431 --> 13:03.608
and time is of the essence, so

13:03.652 --> 13:08.570
maybe you want to help Magnum
save Jason's life

13:08.613 --> 13:13.357
and, uh, deal with
whatever this is after.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.101
MAGNUM:
On my eighth birthday,
I got Legos

13:18.145 --> 13:20.190
from everyone except Uncle Al.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.714
He gave me one
of those juniorColumbo kits,

13:22.758 --> 13:24.847
the kind that teaches you
how to fingerprint.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.458
That summer
I printed everything.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.895
Drove my mom crazy.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.853
Had to wipe powder off
every appliance.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.204
Ah, terrific, not one print.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.859
The thief must have worn gloves or wiped it down.

13:36.903 --> 13:40.036
And no forced entry means
we're looking for a pro.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.691
Well, I am.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.009
What are you doing here?

13:56.052 --> 13:58.098
I saw Irv on the porch here,

13:58.141 --> 13:59.316
and I thought he might've
seen something.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.057
I thought you weren't
working the case.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.624
We're not discussing this now.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.932
You should apologize.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.804
I don't even know
why she's mad.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.545
Doesn't matter.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.460
After 40 years, I can tell you

14:12.503 --> 14:15.550
it's the only way
to preserve a marriage.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.291
Oh, no, we're not married.No! No.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.335
No, no.
No. No.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.989
You should still
say you're sorry.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.557
Makes life a lot easier.Fine.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.908
I'm sorry.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.605
[sighs]
You don't even know why.

14:27.649 --> 14:28.563
He said it doesn't matter.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.915
Anyway, according to Irv,
there have been a recent spate

14:32.959 --> 14:35.787
of neighborhood burglaries,
still unsolved.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.181
So he and his wife set up
their own neighborhood watch.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.791
She was on the night shift.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.793
She see anything?I was just getting to that.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.622
Last three nights,
she saw a guy across the street

14:44.666 --> 14:46.059
sitting in his car.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.974
She called the cops,
they never came.

14:48.017 --> 14:51.064
They said a guy can sit
in his car all he wants.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.717
Can she describe him?

14:52.761 --> 14:54.719
A little too dark.

14:54.763 --> 14:55.895
And how about the car?

14:55.938 --> 14:59.028
Sorry, she's really bad
with cars.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.943
Guessing she didn't get
the license plate.

15:00.987 --> 15:01.944
Of course she did.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.077
We're not amateurs.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.689
So, why the change
of heart?

15:07.732 --> 15:09.952
Oh, right.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.998
Now's not the time.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.825
You gonna run those plates?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.218
Mm-hmm.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.963
[typing]

15:21.007 --> 15:22.878
The vehicle belongs
to Bob Hall.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.272
We've just got to figure out
how he's connected.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.625
We already know.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.019
He's one of
Jason Levner's victims.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.411
So Jason lost his money.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.804
Yeah, it makes sense
he'd try and steal it back.

15:50.993 --> 15:51.951
Hmm.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.953
Expected something bigger.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.519
Jason's clients invested
hundreds of thousands.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.565
Millions even.Maybe Bob did, too.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.393
Till Jason lost it all.

16:00.611 --> 16:04.485
Hey... I know you didn't
want to take the case.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.400
Is it because we'd be
skirting the law?

16:06.443 --> 16:08.576
In success we'll actually
be breaking it.

16:08.619 --> 16:09.577
But, no, that wasn't why.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.795
But you do want to help Lani.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.145
Of course I do.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.408
The case articles report
43 victims.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.757
I would argue that
there were 45.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.021
An innocent child and a woman
who never signed on

16:19.065 --> 16:20.457
for what her husband did.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.809
And now she has
to pay a hefty price.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.779
Can I help you?How you doing?

16:37.822 --> 16:39.737
Thomas Magnum,
private investigator.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.783
This is my partner
Juliet Higgins.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.480
What's this about?

16:43.524 --> 16:45.395
$3 million, to be exact.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.615
I-I don't-- I don't follow.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.922
It was stolen from
Jason Levner's house last night.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.533
I knew that son of a bitch
had all our money

16:52.576 --> 16:54.491
stashed away somewhere.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.406
We know you were
at his house last night.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.192
And you think I was
there to rob him?

16:59.235 --> 17:00.193
If not, then why were you there?

17:00.236 --> 17:02.238
Let's step inside.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.631
If my daughter Faith
comes home early,

17:03.674 --> 17:04.893
I don't want her to hear this.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.161
Before the fraud, Jason
and I were best friends.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.642
Which is why, even though
I never had much money,

17:14.685 --> 17:16.992
I invested my kids'
college fund with him.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.167
Jason lost it all.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.431
Anyway,

17:21.475 --> 17:24.913
Faith started dating
Jason's son Kevin

17:24.956 --> 17:27.611
the last few years.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.091
But after Jason did
what he did, I told her

17:29.135 --> 17:30.832
she couldn't see him anymore.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.660
And what did Faith say?

17:32.703 --> 17:34.836
She said, "Okay."
[chuckles]

17:36.011 --> 17:37.012
Can you believe it?

17:39.058 --> 17:39.884
I don't get it.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.147
Well, if Faith
had fought him

17:41.190 --> 17:44.541
to the death,
it meant she'd probably comply.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.326
But because she agreed
so calmly,

17:46.369 --> 17:49.068
it seemed as though she would
probably keep on seeing him?

17:49.111 --> 17:51.070
It did.Hmm.

17:51.113 --> 17:51.940
You have a teenage daughter?No.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.334
But I was one.Ah.

17:54.377 --> 17:55.335
They're complicated, huh?

17:55.378 --> 17:57.119
Nothing scarier in the world.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.904
Yeah, except maybe
when they grow up. [chuckles]

18:02.907 --> 18:04.953
Look, I'm a single dad.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.302
Faith is all I care about.

18:07.477 --> 18:09.088
But I didn't see her
at the Levners'.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.873
Well, that's because
she wasn't there.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.788
How would you know that?

18:13.831 --> 18:14.963
Because after Jason
went to jail,

18:15.006 --> 18:16.573
Lani sent Kevin
to boarding school.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.794
So... Faith wasn't lying to me.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.883
Mm-mm.[sighs]

18:21.926 --> 18:23.580
Do you remember seeing
anyone there?

18:23.624 --> 18:27.497
Yeah, uh, there was a guy
who went up the driveway.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.108
Came back real fast
with two duffel bags.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.371
Seemed heavy.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.764
[chuckles]
Guess now I know why.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.157
What did he look like?

18:35.201 --> 18:37.159
Sketchy. Made me think
Lani was a criminal, too,

18:37.203 --> 18:38.378
like her husband.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.380
He drove away.

18:40.423 --> 18:43.034
I-I couldn't really see the car.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.601
MAGNUM:
This guy--
do you think you could

18:44.645 --> 18:46.429
describe him to a sketch artist?

18:48.344 --> 18:50.390
You want me to help the Levners?

18:50.433 --> 18:52.000
Just one.

18:52.043 --> 18:55.003
Kevin's still young, and he's
going through a tough time.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.831
As a father,

18:56.874 --> 19:01.009
can't you just look at it
as helping someone else's kid?

19:03.185 --> 19:05.144
♪

19:06.536 --> 19:09.235
Didn't go so well, huh?

19:09.278 --> 19:12.107
Well, I did some digging.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.979
Asked a Ranger pal to find out
who was on those missions

19:15.023 --> 19:16.198
that your buddy described.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.026
Dude, not my buddy.

19:18.069 --> 19:21.029
Whatever. You said fake Skordi
sounded like he was there,

19:21.072 --> 19:24.293
so I began to think...
maybe he was.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.773
Check this out.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.212
TC:
There's the real Skordi.

19:30.256 --> 19:34.303
Yeah, and there's the fake one.
Says his name's James Harris.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.044
Your hunch was right, Rick.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.394
So Harris took the identity
of a dead man

19:38.438 --> 19:41.049
in his own squad? Why?

19:41.092 --> 19:43.617
To steal the real guy's record?

19:43.660 --> 19:46.272
No, no. Skordi was
a good soldier,

19:46.315 --> 19:49.971
but Harris was decorated
for valor three times.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.146
He's even got a Silver Star.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.061
So why would he give that up?

19:54.280 --> 19:56.195
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

19:59.676 --> 20:02.636
Hi, Jason, I'm...

20:02.679 --> 20:05.726
I know.
I spoke to Lani.

20:05.769 --> 20:06.857
Thank you.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.859
We haven't really
done anything yet.

20:08.903 --> 20:11.079
The fact that you're
willing to help me.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.950
Look, I screwed up.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.648
I hurt a lot of people.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.564
Worst of all,
my wife and my boy.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.524
Who else knew about the cash?

20:21.568 --> 20:22.743
Just the dealers
threatening me.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.701
Damon and his number two
Steven.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.529
Have they gotten
physical with you?

20:28.705 --> 20:30.054
Beat me bad a while back.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.970
To make sure that Lani did
what she was supposed to.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.755
Do you know who
stole the cash?

20:34.798 --> 20:36.365
No, not yet.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.019
Lani docks

20:38.062 --> 20:41.283
Now, even if you find the money,
you still got to get it to her.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.632
Jason, we have a lead.

20:42.676 --> 20:45.679
Hey, hey!

20:45.722 --> 20:47.289
I told you, no passing anything
to the prisoner.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.769
Can I at least
show it to him?

20:51.685 --> 20:52.903
You recognize him?

20:52.947 --> 20:56.429
I do. Yeah, that guy was
in here for burglary.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.825
You find anything?

21:01.869 --> 21:04.741
Yeah, I found it and I
just forgot to tell you.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.788
You're not still mad at me
'cause I didn't tell Katsumoto?

21:07.831 --> 21:08.789
I mean, I couldn't...

21:08.832 --> 21:10.181
Yes, Lani told us not to.

It's not just that.

follow the law.

21:15.143 --> 21:18.189
All right? Gordie...

21:18.233 --> 21:19.495
we'd be putting him
in a bad spot.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.323
Or maybe we'd be
involving someone

21:21.367 --> 21:23.194
with the resources
to actually fix this.

21:23.238 --> 21:27.111
Well, that is a...
a very big maybe.

That three mil you stole?

21:44.041 --> 21:44.999
That was mine.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.522
I had somebody sitting

Easy, easy, lady, okay?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.418
I didn't steal
it for myself.

22:12.461 --> 22:15.638
I was under orders to take
those duffels from the garage.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.118
I didn't even know what
was inside of 'em.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.249
You didn't think
to ask?

22:18.293 --> 22:20.861
Instructions were
on a kite. You know?

22:20.904 --> 22:22.863
Those notes written in code
they sneak out of prison.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.038
Yeah, I know what it is.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.954
Who sent it?

22:28.477 --> 22:29.522
Had to be Damon.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.698
He sends one out
like every week.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.352
Could've been his
number two Steven.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.831
Sometimes the kites
come from him.

22:34.875 --> 22:35.919
Well done.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.704
Now, if you don't
want to die,

22:37.747 --> 22:39.793
would you please
hand over the money?

22:41.316 --> 22:42.186
I don't got it.

22:43.492 --> 22:44.711
Try again.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.457
I put the bags by a tree
with a heart carved on it.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.431
Damon's in charge
of trafficking.

23:09.475 --> 23:10.693
It was his drug deal.

23:10.737 --> 23:11.868
There's no way he'd
steal it from himself.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.566
So we're looking
at his number two Steven.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.181
seriously,
you need to tell me

23:20.224 --> 23:21.791
exactly what I did wrong.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.532
You're the brilliant P.I.,

Those are armory boots.

Do you have a pair?No.

23:59.786 --> 24:02.223
Well, then,
how do you know that?I know things.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.094
The only bad thing is,

24:04.138 --> 24:06.096
literally thousands of
guys have those boots.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.751
Great, which will make finding
whoever made those prints

24:08.795 --> 24:11.319
slightly difficult
considering our lack of time.

24:11.362 --> 24:12.842
We should head
back to Wahiawa,

24:12.886 --> 24:15.323
see if Damon's number two
guy will talk to us.Steven?

24:15.366 --> 24:17.325
What makes you think the man
behind the theft of the money

24:17.368 --> 24:18.892
is gonna tell us
who stole it for him?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.809
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

24:22.852 --> 24:24.898
So are you going to tell me
why you think

24:24.941 --> 24:27.509
Steven will talk to us?I don't know.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.728
Will you tell me why
you're mad at me?

24:28.771 --> 24:30.556
So you couldn't
figure it out?

24:30.599 --> 24:33.123
No, I could figure it out.
It's just... You know what

24:33.167 --> 24:34.603
I don't get?
You get mad at me at least,

24:34.647 --> 24:35.822
I don't know, once a day.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.171
But you always come
straightforward with it.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.129
This time, you refuse
to tell me anything.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.262
Which is just... weird.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.485
Unless you're not mad.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.923
You're hurt?

24:52.316 --> 24:56.233
And you don't like
feeling that way.

24:56.277 --> 25:00.411
And you definitely don't like
talking about it.

25:03.719 --> 25:04.851
What are you doing here?

25:06.200 --> 25:09.551
Wait. You called him?

25:09.595 --> 25:11.814
You went behind my back?Of course not.

disregard yourwishes.

Oh. That's it.

It's not because we didn't go
to Katsumoto. It's...

25:22.085 --> 25:24.174
It's bigger than that.

I'm right here, right?

Didn't go to me about what?Uh, well,

25:32.531 --> 25:35.098
we had a favor to ask,
that was earlier.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.535

Yeah.

Who are you?It doesn't matter.

What does matter is that we know
about the missing cash.

What are you talking about?

26:09.568 --> 26:12.266

have to go to your boss Damon?

I don't think he's gonna
like that too much.

If you do that, he's
gonna think I took it.

going to tell Damon.

There was this woman
in Oahu, Kalea,

with Dan became a relationship.

When Kalea's next letter came,
I couldn't break her heart,

28:01.201 --> 28:03.986

Once. Again, again,

28:07.598 --> 28:09.339

Yeah. I figured

28:10.906 --> 28:14.518
when my tour was over,
I would tell her in person.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.346
But when I got there...

28:19.045 --> 28:20.829
...she thought I was Dan.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.486
By then I loved her, too.

28:25.529 --> 28:27.357
The harder I fell,

28:27.401 --> 28:30.621
the more afraid I was
