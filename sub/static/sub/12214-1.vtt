01:09.640 --> 01:11.232
Okay.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.311
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.515
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.816
Come on, let's go. Let's go, buddy.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.680
Come on, come on, we gotta move,
we gotta move.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.040
Whoa!

01:24.520 --> 01:26.715
Uh-oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:26.800 --> 01:28.074
No, no, no, no, no!

01:34.840 --> 01:35.840
Huh?

01:35.880 --> 01:37.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:37.360 --> 01:39.396
Hey! Hey! Gotcha!

01:40.240 --> 01:42.071
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:42.640 --> 01:46.599
Ow! Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

01:47.800 --> 01:49.870
I don't like it! I don't like it!

01:55.880 --> 01:56.995
Whoo!

01:59.840 --> 02:01.193
Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow! Ow!

02:01.280 --> 02:02.872
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh!

02:02.960 --> 02:05.076
Beak! Wing! Tail!

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
Ribs!

02:06.720 --> 02:07.869
Giblets!

02:09.360 --> 02:10.395
Ha!

02:12.520 --> 02:13.520
I'm flying!

02:13.560 --> 02:14.629
Nope, still can't fly.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.557
I cannot believe this.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.879
Breathe, breathe.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.079
Bottom feeder.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.879
Up and over!

02:30.720 --> 02:31.914
Whew!

02:35.000 --> 02:36.149
Ta-da!

02:36.360 --> 02:37.496
No, no, no, no.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.431
Look. It's okay. I'm just a clown.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.794
Oh, boy.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.836
That's a loud... Loud...

02:42.920 --> 02:44.319
You're very scared of me.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.753
Here, come here.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.068
Nope. Okay. Nope. Never mind.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.275
Uh, happy hatchday!

02:48.360 --> 02:49.360
Oh! Hi, pal.

02:49.400 --> 02:53.712
You must be so disappointed
in yourself for being this late.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.096
I'm not late. Look at the time.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.917
See, the order said before noon.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.309
Okay, now you're late.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.277
- What?
- Where have you been?

03:04.360 --> 03:06.416
- It's funny you ask. You see, I was...
- You missed the party.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.192
- What is that?
- Oh, that.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.560
Um, yes, see, I fell on the box.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.999
Oh, the squirrel?

03:12.080 --> 03:13.274
That's on us.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.920
You know, I tried to keep my body
between the ground and the box,

03:15.960 --> 03:17.720
but, you know,
I think I got a little bruise.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.358
See anything back there?

03:19.440 --> 03:20.509
Hear that, honey?

03:20.600 --> 03:25.151
The clown we paid to be here an hour ago
fell on our son's hatchday cake.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.754
That's why our son's hatchday party
is ruined!

03:27.840 --> 03:28.840
Oh!

03:28.920 --> 03:31.878
And the next time you mess up,
don't tell me a story,

03:31.960 --> 03:34.997
just take responsibility.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.559
Hey, man, it wasn't a story.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.870
"I'm a screwup that woke up late

03:38.960 --> 03:40.936
"and fell on the thing you paid for!"

03:40.960 --> 03:43.976
- It wasn't a story. I almost drowned.
- "I'm really bad at my job and I'm late..."

03:44.000 --> 03:45.399
Why don't we just settle this out

03:45.480 --> 03:47.232
- and say the cake's on you.
- You.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.351
I'm sorry, it's on me?

03:55.480 --> 03:56.993
Well, who else would it be on?

03:58.400 --> 04:01.073
Well, you know, I...

04:01.160 --> 04:04.835
I'm not sure you're gonna like this, um,
but since you asked.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.357
Rather than being on me, as you suggested,

04:08.440 --> 04:10.237
this cake is on you!

04:13.960 --> 04:15.313
So, you wanna hear a story?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.829
I run my butt off, literally, mind you,

04:17.920 --> 04:20.036
to get the "gluten-free cake."

04:20.120 --> 04:21.553
What the heck is gluten?

04:21.640 --> 04:23.835
I mean, does gluten even exist?

04:23.920 --> 04:25.319
Who are you?

04:25.400 --> 04:26.435
Get outta here!

04:26.520 --> 04:28.440
Already? But you're the only one
that's had cake.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.480
What...

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
Mmm.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.268
Oh, that's good stuff.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.656
Mmm. Anybody want to eat some cake
off their dad or husband?

04:34.680 --> 04:37.638
Who needs plates when you got
this guy's face, right?

04:37.920 --> 04:39.717
Oh, oh, mmm! Oh, wait. I almost forgot.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.336
You know, I'm supposed to do
a quick customer satisfaction survey

04:42.360 --> 04:44.032
before I split, okay?

04:44.120 --> 04:47.271
So, on a scale of one to three stars,
what would you say about my performance?

04:47.360 --> 04:48.856
And don't forget, the squirrel was...

04:48.880 --> 04:50.393
...free...

04:54.680 --> 04:57.797
- Sorry about this!
- No!

04:58.520 --> 05:01.193
My bad.

05:02.960 --> 05:03.960
Huh!

05:11.160 --> 05:12.832
Mmm!

05:13.560 --> 05:14.879
Congratulations!

05:15.000 --> 05:16.149
- Huh?
- Oh!

05:16.240 --> 05:17.389
It's a boy!

05:25.920 --> 05:26.955
Mmm.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.116
Mmm.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.040
Hmm?

05:32.160 --> 05:34.230
- Ooh. Ooh, ooh.
- Huh?

05:34.320 --> 05:36.436
Mm. Mm.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.032
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

05:47.280 --> 05:49.157
Hey, Eyebrows.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.229
Eyebrows!

05:56.320 --> 05:57.594
Eyebrows!

06:16.120 --> 06:17.519
Whee!

06:22.800 --> 06:24.074
Huh?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.235
Oh!

06:33.560 --> 06:34.560
Hmm.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.833
Uh-oh.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.800
Hmm?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh.

07:06.680 --> 07:12.232
Your Honor, our family has
always practiced natural childhatch.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.199
The risks of having
a scrambled infant are too great.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.952
There was going to be music,

07:18.080 --> 07:21.231
the nest was going to be full of
beautiful, fresh-cut flowers.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.238
And the first two faces he was going to see

07:25.320 --> 07:26.912
were the loving faces

07:27.000 --> 07:28.416
of his mother and his father.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.635
We can never get that moment back.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.794
Ma'am, I never wanted my face to be
the first face your baby saw.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.536
I mean,
what are we talking about here?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.278
He probably doesn't even remember me.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.195
Daddy!

07:43.280 --> 07:45.271
No, no, no. No. Shh. Shut up.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.400
Shut up.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.555
Cool it.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.111
Ladies and gentlemen,
am I a passionate bird?

07:52.240 --> 07:53.275
Yes.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.554
Guilty as can be.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.756
- It was a quality cake.
- Mmm.

07:56.840 --> 08:00.799
Look, I worked very hard
to get it there on time

08:00.880 --> 08:04.031
and he wouldn't even try it!

08:04.120 --> 08:08.318
Mr. Red, we are
a happy, happy bird community.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.469
Mmm-hmm.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.755
Under the protection of Mighty Eagle,

08:12.920 --> 08:16.595
we work, we play, we laugh, we love,

08:16.680 --> 08:19.831
and we live our lives
free from conflict and strife, sir.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.229
We love the sound
of our own voice, too, evidently.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.956
Perhaps you never heard the joke,
"Why don't birds fly?"

08:26.040 --> 08:27.268
I'm gonna tell you why.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.834
Because where else
would we ever wanna go?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.275
- It gets me every time, guys!
- Wow! Not a good joke.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.591
So now, what am I to make
of the likes of you?

08:37.919 --> 08:40.878
There seems to be a recurring issue here.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.515
Anger.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.015
I don't think
I have an anger issue.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.632
I think you got an anger issue.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.878
Anger is a weed growing in our garden.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.477
And what do you do when you find a weed?

08:56.800 --> 08:59.109
I don't know,
but I bet you're gonna tell me.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.918
You pluck it out!

09:01.080 --> 09:02.798
Oh, my God.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.869
Mr. Red, when you moved your house
outside of our village,

09:06.960 --> 09:09.349
did you notice that
nobody tried to stop you?

09:10.520 --> 09:16.277
Birds, they may smile at you on the street,
but that doesn't mean they like you.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.469
Mmm-hmm. Hey, you know what?
I got a question for you.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.075
Are you aware that that robe
that you're wearing isn't fooling anybody?

09:24.160 --> 09:28.358
We all see ya prancing along the street,
Your Honor!

09:28.440 --> 09:31.876
And you're, what, and I'm just
approximating here, like, an inch tall?

09:31.960 --> 09:33.456
You... What are you doing?

09:33.480 --> 09:35.277
<i>Voilà!</i>

09:35.640 --> 09:36.675
Yeesh.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.016
What the...

09:38.040 --> 09:39.553
Daddy!

09:39.680 --> 09:42.717
Mr. Red, given the severity of the crimes,

09:42.800 --> 09:48.989
I have no choice but to impose
the maximum penalty allowed by the law.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.992
Anger management class.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.160
Oh.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.759
Pluck my life.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.436
- Fresh worms caught today.
- Huh?

10:00.520 --> 10:01.714
Hey, Red. How are ya?

10:01.800 --> 10:02.800
Oh, I'm horrible.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.840
Oh, hi, Red.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.989
It's good to see you!

10:05.080 --> 10:06.816
- I wish I could say the same.
- Get your worms here!

10:06.840 --> 10:08.114
Upsy-daisy!

10:10.040 --> 10:11.519
Thank you.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.670
Ah! Huh?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.153
Huh?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.274
- Let's go.
- Oh.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.551
How are you, Susie? You good?

10:20.680 --> 10:23.148
No running. No running.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.233
- Ooh!
- Come on.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.193
Hey, how's that nap schedule coming along?

10:28.280 --> 10:29.633
Oh, boy.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.550
You guys ever thought about bird control?

10:32.880 --> 10:33.880
Oof!

10:33.960 --> 10:35.109
Left, right, left, right.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.633
There ya go.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.875
Hey, hey.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.752
All right. Oop!

10:51.080 --> 10:52.672
Shirley.

10:52.760 --> 10:53.875
Girly, you got this.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.120
We don't want you to fall, now.
Take your time.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.071
Here we go. That's it.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.953
Oh, you're doing it!

11:03.280 --> 11:04.280
Seriously?

11:04.360 --> 11:05.588
I'm almost there.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.988
Hmm?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.080
Nope.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.229
Hmm.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.313
Pigeon pose.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.079
Crane pose.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.280
Okay, we worked out.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.231
- Who's down for a froyo?
- Ooh!

11:34.320 --> 11:35.355
- Froyo.
- Wow.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.192
"Mighty Mighty Eagle, soaring free.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.952
"Defender of our homes and liberty!"

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
Hi, Red.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.599
Is one of those yours?

11:41.720 --> 11:42.720
What?

11:42.800 --> 11:44.552
Yeah, when birds fly.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.756
"Mighty Eagle is a legend."

12:20.440 --> 12:21.475
Mmm.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.309
You think that's funny? Ha-ha-ha!

12:33.440 --> 12:34.509
This is funny!

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
Uh-oh.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.480
Oh! Ah! Come on!

12:56.920 --> 12:57.920
What?

13:04.400 --> 13:05.400
Oof!

13:09.880 --> 13:11.359
Whew!

13:16.200 --> 13:17.792
Hmm?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.472
Don't look, Bobby.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.756
The anger might be contagious.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.160
Let's go!

13:23.880 --> 13:26.394
- He started it.
- Move it, move it! Don't look back!

13:27.920 --> 13:29.399
There you go.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.235
Uh-huh.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.315
Oh, look at this.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.152
This is gonna be awful.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.236
Okay, I guess that's art.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.193
That's garbage.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.113
And that's exotic.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.954
"Free rage" what?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.056
Oh, hi!

14:01.080 --> 14:02.559
- Hi there! Welcome...
- Oh, hello.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.835
...to the Infinity Acceptance group.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.353
- I am Matilda.
- Okay.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.797
And I'm just super psyched
to be taking this journey with you!

14:10.920 --> 14:13.195
Ah! You're gonna have a blast.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.759
I'm really fun.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.592
Everybody says that about me.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.079
Hey, guys.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.513
Say hello to Red, everyone.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
Hello!

14:21.320 --> 14:22.548
Hi, Red.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.551
Hello, birds I won't get to know well.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.256
Hey, apparently somebody didn't get
the memo that we like to start on time

14:27.280 --> 14:28.296
because you're about two minutes late.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.360
Don't let it happen again.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.400
Hi, my name is Chuck.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.496
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.714
I like you a lot. I can tell.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.155
Okay.

14:34.240 --> 14:38.199
Now, Red, would you like to
share your story with us?

14:38.280 --> 14:39.429
No, not really.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.478
Well, the court mentioned
something about a rage episode

14:42.560 --> 14:44.835
at a child's birthday party.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.031
How long is this class, anyway?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.475
As long as you make it.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.152
- Really? Oh, okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.789
Uh, gentlemen, very nice to see you,
and to almost meet you.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.816
Probably the nicest part of it
is not getting to meet you,

14:56.840 --> 14:58.456
you know, in some weird way.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.357
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead

15:00.440 --> 15:04.069
and scoot on back out
past those creepy statues and, uh...

15:04.160 --> 15:05.957
Back you go.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.076
Sure. No, I can take a seat.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.196
So, in another sense,

15:10.280 --> 15:16.037
you are here until I notify the court
that your anger issues have been resolved.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.395
Oh, boy.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.520
Chuck!

15:19.560 --> 15:21.039
Share your story with Red.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.190
Me? I am the last guy who should be here.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.633
Simple speeding ticket.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.474
Judge tells me I was going too fast,
so I say, "Your Honor, to be honest, I was.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.595
"You caught me."

15:29.680 --> 15:31.113
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.310
So, shouldn't I be in
honesty management class?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.630
'Cause we gotta manage my honesty.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.909
Mmm-hmm.

15:37.040 --> 15:41.591
My one problem, that's a different story
than you told last time.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.070
<i>Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police</i>

15:49.200 --> 15:51.077
<i>Woop-woop! That's the sound of the beast</i>

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
Hmm.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.952
<i>Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police</i>

15:54.040 --> 15:56.679
<i>Woop-woop! That's the sound of the beast</i>

15:56.760 --> 15:59.149
<i>Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police</i>

15:59.240 --> 16:01.834
<i>Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast</i>

16:07.560 --> 16:09.551
Drinks on me, guys!

16:11.800 --> 16:14.360
<i>Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police</i>

16:14.440 --> 16:16.715
<i>Woop-woop! That's the sound of the beast</i>

16:16.800 --> 16:18.677
- Mmm-mmm.
<i>- Chuck?</i>

16:18.760 --> 16:20.671
Okay, maybe it wasn't ice cream.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.716
All right, Chuck, thanks. We got it.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.360
And this is T erence.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.276
Whew! More like terrifying.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.233
Now, it says here, in your little filey...

16:45.160 --> 16:49.551
Terence, uh, seems to have had
an incident.

16:49.960 --> 16:53.316
Now, Bomb started with us two weeks ago.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.231
Tell us your story, Bomb.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.955
Okay.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.395
Well, sometimes when I get upset,

16:59.480 --> 17:03.837
I, uh, have been known to, uh, blow up.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.954
So, like, uh... Like, what, like,
you get mad, you mean?

17:07.040 --> 17:08.189
Well, no.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.031
I literally blow up, okay?

17:10.119 --> 17:12.588
I explode like a bomb.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.992
Hence the name.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.118
Surprise!

17:27.079 --> 17:28.798
Ah, excuse me.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.029
Party foul.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.120
Ow!

17:32.440 --> 17:34.476
Do it!

17:34.560 --> 17:35.560
No can do.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.312
I just went boom-boom before class.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.616
Hey, look, I don't want to be here at all,

17:38.640 --> 17:42.349
but this can maybe make it a little more
interesting to me, so please, explode.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.714
You can't do it, can you?

17:43.800 --> 17:44.869
Yes, I can,

17:45.000 --> 17:46.991
- but I'm having back issues today.
- Ugh!

17:47.080 --> 17:49.196
So, I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.713
Oh, do it!

17:50.840 --> 17:52.176
Not the time or place, little amigo.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.111
These guys are all nuts, huh, big man?

17:57.240 --> 17:59.959
Are we speaking telepathically,
or you're just...

18:02.320 --> 18:03.673
Good talk.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.596
Nice chatting with you.

18:06.680 --> 18:11.117
Today we're gonna be working on
managing our anger through movement.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.435
- Mmm.
- The first pose is the dancer pose.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.800
Great form, Terence.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.068
Mmm! Eagle! Heron!

18:19.200 --> 18:20.200
Peacock! Warrior!

18:20.280 --> 18:22.316
Mountain! Tree! Rabbit! Fish! Locust!
King pigeon!

18:22.400 --> 18:23.913
And of course, downward duck.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.393
Huh?

18:25.760 --> 18:28.228
Uh, excuse me, boring hippie lady.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.056
- Uh-huh?
- Looks like the explodey guy's gonna puke.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.638
And have you done this before?

18:31.720 --> 18:33.676
Uh, yes, I have, but usually not for free.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.239
Didn't think so.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.016
- Awesome.
- And how are we doing over here, Bomb?

18:37.040 --> 18:40.032
Doing wonderful.
Stretching out the core.

18:40.280 --> 18:45.115
Just remember to breathe up
through your feathers and from your talons.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.997
<i>Namaste.</i>

18:47.080 --> 18:48.957
Bomb?

18:53.720 --> 18:54.835
Nice!

18:56.280 --> 18:57.600
I don't know what happened.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.552
I was doing the poses,
I was feeling all Zen,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.950
Matilda was digging it,
then I lost my grip on it.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.071
Let it slip and it just squeaked out.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.229
Hey, so, where we going?

19:07.320 --> 19:08.958
I'm sorry. "We"?

19:09.040 --> 19:10.040
Yes, we.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.390
There's a new happiness exhibit
at the Museum of Happiness

19:13.520 --> 19:15.272
that I'm dying to see.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.520
Uh, you know what?

19:16.560 --> 19:18.312
I... I mean, I got a... I got a thing.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
A thing?

19:19.760 --> 19:21.034
Like a disease?

19:21.120 --> 19:22.917
Is it bird flu? Chicken pox?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.399
Cardinal sin?

19:24.480 --> 19:27.950
No, by "thing," I mean, like, um,
desire not to hang out.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.040
With you.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.760
Oh.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.896
Oh, yeah, well...
You know, may be for the best, you know,

19:32.920 --> 19:35.639
because, uh, I got something, too.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.518
Ha! How did I forget?

19:37.600 --> 19:40.672
Even if you'd said yes,
I probably couldn't have gone.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.952
I'm busy, too.

19:44.200 --> 19:50.389
I have a, uh, business offer,
uh, deal that is, uh...

19:50.480 --> 19:52.436
No, Bomb, you're not good at this, buddy.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.069
It's... It's charming up to a point,
and now it's just sad.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.792
It's a guy I know.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.554
And he's opening up

20:00.640 --> 20:03.108
- a brand-new luxury...
- Mmm-mmm.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.718
...class reunion.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.115
Okay.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.350
Good. Good, good, good.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.192
Well, looks like it's just us.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.713
Want to go get a bite?

20:12.800 --> 20:16.634
Oh, but what about your "class reunion"
where everybody brings a "business offer"?

20:16.720 --> 20:18.790
Oh! No, no, no.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.552
Chuck, I was lying.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.834
I'm sorry if I fooled you.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.349
- Hmm?
- Nuh-uh! No means no.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
Hmm.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
My sweetheart.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.514
Cheers.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.434
- Hey!
- Hmm?

20:37.840 --> 20:38.909
Get over here!

20:39.000 --> 20:40.956
Hey, peckerhead!

20:41.040 --> 20:42.837
What's up?

20:43.160 --> 20:44.559
Hmm.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.230
<i>To be the sad man</i>

20:47.800 --> 20:48.835
Ooh!

20:50.120 --> 20:52.839
- Oh! Oh, I felt a peck!
- Oh!

20:55.000 --> 20:59.357
<i>And no one knows what it's like to be hated</i>

21:00.840 --> 21:03.070
<i>To be fated</i>

21:04.360 --> 21:07.397
<i>To telling only lies</i>

21:11.480 --> 21:14.472
This is the legendary Mighty Eagle,

21:14.560 --> 21:19.031
our protector and hero,
but no one has seen him for years.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.393
Mighty Eagle is missing.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.516
When's Mighty Eagle gonna come back?

21:24.920 --> 21:28.879
Eyebrows, didn't your parents ever tell you
Mighty Eagle isn't real?

21:28.960 --> 21:31.155
Shh. He doesn't know that.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.708
- He doesn't have parents.
- Yeah.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.871
Or even friends.

21:40.600 --> 21:46.550
<i>No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings</i>

21:47.520 --> 21:49.476
<i>Like I do</i>

21:51.400 --> 21:53.550
<i>And I blame you</i>

21:56.520 --> 22:02.072
<i>No one bites back as hard on their anger</i>

22:03.560 --> 22:06.757
<i>None of my pain and woe</i>

22:07.600 --> 22:09.511
<i>Can show through</i>

22:23.840 --> 22:26.593
Aha! Eureka!

22:31.120 --> 22:32.519
Say bye to Daddy.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.669
Bye-bye!

22:33.760 --> 22:35.239
- Goodbye, hatchlings.
- Bye!

22:35.440 --> 22:37.112
Have a happy day!

22:37.720 --> 22:38.755
Good morning!

22:38.840 --> 22:39.955
Morning, Your Honor.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.515
Ow!

22:41.600 --> 22:42.919
Here you go.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.599
Bless you.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.794
Mmm!

22:48.120 --> 22:49.120
Mmm!

22:51.480 --> 22:52.708
- Yes!
- Bye!

22:52.800 --> 22:53.869
Daddy's making dinner!

22:54.440 --> 22:58.558
"If my name were Bobby
Would you ask about my hobbies?"

22:58.640 --> 22:59.675
Whoa!

22:59.760 --> 23:02.274
"Or if my name were Judas
Would you ask me what my mood is?"

23:03.000 --> 23:06.390
"I laugh, I cry, I love, I hate

23:07.120 --> 23:10.874
"I do so much more than detonate"

23:11.920 --> 23:13.319
Think about it.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.671
That was beautiful.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.513
Oh, you're gonna make me cry!

23:18.000 --> 23:20.355
Yeah, that was some real clever symbolism.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.393
Ah! Red, why don't we hear your poem?

23:23.480 --> 23:25.152
- I don't have a poem.
- Uh-huh.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.275
Why not?

23:26.360 --> 23:28.669
Because I didn't write one.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.353
Right. Uh-huh.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.512
And is there a reason?

23:32.640 --> 23:33.896
Well, you know, I was gonna do it,

23:33.920 --> 23:38.038
but then I thought about it and I realized,
"Oh, this is a huge waste of my time."

23:38.120 --> 23:39.155
So, I didn't do it.

23:39.320 --> 23:41.629
Deep breath, deep breath.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.119
Deep breath!

23:43.520 --> 23:44.520
Ah!

23:44.640 --> 23:46.551
And we're back in the now.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.915
Chuck! You've had your hand up
the whole time.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Mmm-hmm.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.679
My poem is about a hate crime.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.360
Uh-oh.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.072
Oh, no.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.589
Lot of sickos out there. Lot of sickos.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.993
"What, oh, what did I make you of?

24:07.080 --> 24:08.718
- "I made you out of love"
- MATILDA: Aw.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.393
"But wait, too late!

24:10.480 --> 24:12.311
"Now I see your fate

24:12.400 --> 24:16.518
"Some very troubled somebody
Destroyed you out of hate"

24:18.960 --> 24:21.997
"What could have made him so despise

24:22.080 --> 24:24.310
"Your happy smile, your laughing eyes?

24:25.600 --> 24:28.592
- "Your soul was pure, your heart was true"
- Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.434
"And someone hated that

24:31.880 --> 24:33.233
"But who?"

24:39.400 --> 24:40.549
Terence.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.514
Yeah, I deserved that.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.272
- Billy has passed...
- Oh!

24:48.360 --> 24:50.555
...to a higher plane of existence.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.471
Everyone, join wings.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.708
Let us all say our goodbyes.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.950
Yeah, let me get in here.
I gotta say goodbye.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.040
Okay.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.216
Okay. You know,
I'll just mourn from back here.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.240
That's fine.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.936
You know, if there's one thing
Billy always hated,

25:04.960 --> 25:07.155
- it was goodbyes.
- Hey, what's going on out there?

25:08.400 --> 25:10.231
Oh! Class dismissed.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.314
Very moving.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.776
Come on, everybody! Let's go!

25:14.800 --> 25:16.153
Hey, where's everybody going?

25:16.240 --> 25:17.753
Hurry! Something's coming!

25:17.840 --> 25:19.360
Last one to the beach is a rotten egg!

25:19.440 --> 25:20.440
Let's go!

25:20.560 --> 25:23.120
Coming through! Pardon me! Excuse me!

25:25.120 --> 25:26.519
What?

25:30.280 --> 25:32.236
Ah! Again?

25:32.320 --> 25:34.197
Let's get down to the beach!

25:34.280 --> 25:35.599
Follow the trail!

25:35.720 --> 25:37.392
Last one there is a rotten eggy!

25:37.480 --> 25:38.480
What?

25:46.360 --> 25:47.918
- Huh!
- Didn't mean to photobomb you.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.240
Sorry about that.

25:51.640 --> 25:52.675
What is that thing?

25:52.760 --> 25:56.309
It looks like a UFO.
An Unidentified Floating Object.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.233
Daddy!

25:58.320 --> 26:00.311
Stop it. No, I'm not your daddy!

26:01.000 --> 26:02.069
What is that?

26:02.160 --> 26:04.616
- Look at the size of that thing!
- Where's it going?

26:04.640 --> 26:06.835
I don't know, but it's not stopping.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.710
My house, my house.

26:12.840 --> 26:13.840
Slow down!

26:13.920 --> 26:14.920
Stop!

26:22.040 --> 26:23.473
Aw.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.229
Phew!

26:30.720 --> 26:32.039
What the...

26:35.680 --> 26:39.036
- That house took me five years to build.
- Wow!

26:39.120 --> 26:43.557
It's such a shame when you create
something and someone just destroys it.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.999
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:47.080 --> 26:49.992
- we have a very special guest for you!
- Huh?

26:50.280 --> 26:53.113
- He's a green marine sailing machine.
- Careful, now.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.192
And he's keen to let you
know he's not mean!

26:56.280 --> 27:00.831
Put your wings together for Leonard!

27:02.720 --> 27:04.153
Thank you so much.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.516
Please hold your applause.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.272
Greetings from my world!

27:10.360 --> 27:12.794
The world of the pigs.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.234
What's a pig?

27:14.640 --> 27:16.870
I am a pig.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.319
Unbelievable.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.719
Unbelievable.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.319
Oh! Where we going?

27:27.400 --> 27:28.719
Wrong way.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.991
Oopsie. Not working.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.192
We practiced this 100 times.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.998
- Oh, man.
- Give it to me.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.877
- Oh.
- We're gonna come in again.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.393
I'm so sorry.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.958
My name is Leonard...

27:43.040 --> 27:44.758
...but my friends call me Chuckles.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.229
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Very generous!

27:47.320 --> 27:50.039
- Thank...
- We mean no harm.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.793
We saw your island across the sea,

27:52.880 --> 27:54.359
and we thought,

27:54.440 --> 27:56.112
"Wonder what they're up to."

27:56.320 --> 27:58.470
But there's no other place besides here.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.749
- Yes, there is.
- Stop it!

27:59.840 --> 28:01.720
- And we are from there.
- Please stop!

28:01.760 --> 28:03.876
We call it Piggy Island.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.519
Oh, my God.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.275
P-I-double-G-Y Island.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.988
Who else is out there?

28:11.080 --> 28:14.197
My first officer, Ross, and I
have sailed everywhere.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.033
One brave soul against the sea.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.120
And Ross.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.160
Uh, excuse me.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.516
Have you come to smash
all of our houses or just mine?

28:22.800 --> 28:24.392
Oh, man!

28:24.480 --> 28:26.118
Somebody want a gift basket?

28:26.200 --> 28:28.156
Please, please, don't be afraid.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.438
My partner and I request

28:30.560 --> 28:32.198
the honor of your friendship.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.191
- Ross, show 'em how we do it.
- Oh!

28:34.560 --> 28:36.790
Don't worry, he's had all his shots.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.240
We're all friends now!

28:38.320 --> 28:39.320
Hi, friends.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.120
Oh, not a hugger.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.958
Huh?

28:45.640 --> 28:48.200
Welcome to Bird Island!

28:48.280 --> 28:50.919
Welcome to our new friends, the pigs.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.749
Let us have a celebration!

28:53.840 --> 28:55.831
- Put 'er there!
- Welcome!

28:56.160 --> 28:58.196
- Whoo! Sorry.
- And a hoof to a wing.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.511
<i>We would like to honor the pigs
with a special performance.</i>

29:02.840 --> 29:04.114
<i>Hey, let's explo-o-o-ode!</i>

29:04.200 --> 29:05.315
<i>Explode!</i>

29:05.760 --> 29:08.911
Oh, watch out. Shakin' my bacon!

29:09.000 --> 29:10.194
They don't have feathers?

29:10.280 --> 29:12.111
You know, they're just
walking around naked,

29:12.200 --> 29:13.394
just presenting themselves.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.192
I'm looking at all their business here.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.032
That part about them I really admire.

29:17.120 --> 29:20.829
Now we would like to welcome
our special guests, the pigs!

29:21.040 --> 29:22.712
All right!

29:22.800 --> 29:25.792
Thank you for your
kindness and hospitality.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.030
Our king sends his warmest regards.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.160
"King"?

29:29.240 --> 29:33.756
You have shared with us the wonders
of your quaint, simple little island.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.673
Drop the banner, Ross!

29:37.360 --> 29:39.430
- Whoa! Uh-oh.
- Now we would love to humbly share

29:39.520 --> 29:41.909
some of the wonders of our world.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.996
Yeah. Humble, my bird butt.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.274
Language.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.033
A hundred years from now,
everyone will ask,

29:48.120 --> 29:51.715
"How did the friendship between
the pigs and the birds start?"

29:51.920 --> 29:52.920
Who cares?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.035
Oh, no.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.031
Well, let them say we lit up the night!

30:00.600 --> 30:02.033
Holy moly!

30:05.160 --> 30:06.275
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

30:06.480 --> 30:09.472
Hey, look, they destroyed more of the stuff
we worked hard to build.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.232
- But there's more!
- More?

30:11.320 --> 30:13.436
Has gravity gone haywire?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.317
No! Even better!

30:15.400 --> 30:18.517
Your friends, the pigs, proudly give you

30:18.600 --> 30:21.558
the trampoline!

30:22.280 --> 30:24.510
- Those are my assistants, Oinky...
- Hello.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.352
...and Jon Ham!

30:26.440 --> 30:27.440
Hold on a second.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.496
I thought there was only supposed to be
two of these guys.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.919
Squad goals!

30:31.000 --> 30:34.037
- Look at those jiggly pigglies!
- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

30:34.120 --> 30:35.439
But that's not all.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.074
Throwing things just got
a whole lot easier.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.991
Say hello to

30:40.080 --> 30:41.672
the slingshot!

30:41.760 --> 30:43.671
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

30:43.800 --> 30:45.392
- I can't see. Wow!
- This is crazy!

30:45.480 --> 30:47.920
- Tired of carrying things from place to place?
- Yeah!

30:47.960 --> 30:50.872
- Wish you could just get it there?
- Yeah!

30:50.960 --> 30:52.359
- Well, now you can!
- How?

30:52.440 --> 30:53.839
- Waiters, do me a favor.
- Huh?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.336
- Take the rest of the night off.
- Thank you.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.749
Hey, if you got the night off,
why don't you fix my house!

30:58.160 --> 31:00.071
Yeah, it's the same guy.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.593
Well, the slingshot
does it all in three easy steps.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.990
Ready, aim, fire!

31:08.080 --> 31:09.080
I got it!

31:09.120 --> 31:10.473
Incredible!

31:11.120 --> 31:13.315
- Flown in fresh!
- Me! Me! I want fruit!

31:13.960 --> 31:16.918
Guys, it's the same fruit sitting
on the plates in front of you.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.881
- Watch out for that pineapple.
- Somebody, please...

31:20.920 --> 31:23.150
And now for our last gift to you.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.037
Shut up and fix my house!

31:25.120 --> 31:26.678
We don't know him.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.953
I'm going to ask for
a volunteer from the audience.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.393
Pick me!

31:33.480 --> 31:34.480
Who should I pick?

31:34.560 --> 31:36.232
- Who, who, who?
- Pick me, Mr. Pig!

31:36.320 --> 31:38.880
How about the red guy
with the enormous eyebrows?

31:39.000 --> 31:40.035
Aw.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.917
- Me?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.479
- Yeah!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:43.640 --> 31:44.959
Yes, you, sir.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.075
Come on up here.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.388
It's your lucky day!

31:47.480 --> 31:48.656
Are you sure you don't want to choose

31:48.680 --> 31:50.736
one of the hundreds of birds
that had their wings up?

31:50.760 --> 31:52.136
- Get him up here!
- Come on, Red!

31:52.160 --> 31:53.309
Have some fun!

31:53.800 --> 31:55.597
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

31:55.680 --> 31:57.398
Oh, he's shy.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.515
You hear that?

31:58.600 --> 31:59.600
They're cheering for you.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.908
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.230
Red guy with the eyebrows!

32:03.320 --> 32:06.153
I would've sat closer had I known
that I was gonna be part of the show.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.874
Okay, now what?

32:07.960 --> 32:10.315
Come on, give him a hand.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.656
Right this way. Come on.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.829
Relax. Be brave.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.956
- Ready!
- Who, me? Yeah, no, I'm ready.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.598
- Aim!
- Aim at what?

32:16.680 --> 32:18.480
- Everybody on this one.
- Fire!

32:21.640 --> 32:23.756
Who says birds don't fly?

32:23.840 --> 32:25.637
This seems really unnatural!

32:25.760 --> 32:27.637
I hope he's okay.

32:27.760 --> 32:28.954
Ow!

32:36.040 --> 32:37.075
Hey, don't worry!

32:37.160 --> 32:38.388
I'm fine!

32:38.480 --> 32:39.959
Thanks for the lift!

32:40.040 --> 32:42.156
I wish they would have done that
10 minutes ago.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.080
Oh.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.829
You know you want to search their boat.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.558
What? No, I don't.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.469
Yeah, you're right, I do.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.234
Bomb's on his way. Mmm. Mmm!

32:58.520 --> 33:01.159
Come on. Let's go.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.231
And remember, keep it quiet.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.192
Oh, yeah.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.829
- Whoa! This is an impressive ship!
- Shh. No. Inside voice.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.114
Inside voice.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.200
- Come on.
- Oh.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.309
Sorry.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.873
Hmm. Piggy fitness.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.160
Mmm-hmm.

33:25.480 --> 33:26.480
Ugh!

33:26.680 --> 33:27.954
Mmm? Mmm-mmm.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.120
Ah!

33:32.720 --> 33:34.153
- Very strange.
- Mmm.

33:34.960 --> 33:35.960
Mmm.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.635
- Huh?
- Huh?

33:39.040 --> 33:40.473
Who are these weirdos?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.595
Huh?

33:41.880 --> 33:43.438
Whoa!

33:47.280 --> 33:49.271
What are you doing?
We're trying to sneak around.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.510
- We didn't rent this place out.
- Wow!

33:51.600 --> 33:52.976
- You can rent this place?
- Hmm?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.479
- Give me that!
- Aw.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.759
Hey, you guys!

34:01.040 --> 34:02.359
No.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.999
Looks like there's
some more stuff down here.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.630
We were hiding.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.230
When I say, "Hey!" you say, "Ho!"

34:18.320 --> 34:19.799
- Hey!
- Ho!

34:20.120 --> 34:22.554
- Hey!
- Ho!

34:22.639 --> 34:24.119
There's more of them!

34:24.199 --> 34:25.199
Hey!

34:25.440 --> 34:26.873
Ho... Oh!

34:27.000 --> 34:29.389
That's right, I'm back. Uh-huh.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.194
Enjoying the party, everyone?

34:31.320 --> 34:36.393
Because while you were living it up,
I snuck onto their boat.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.456
- What?
- What did he say?

34:38.480 --> 34:40.232
And look at what I found.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.591
There's more of them than we thought!

34:43.679 --> 34:46.148
Which is, um, mysterious and weird,
am I right?

34:47.880 --> 34:48.915
Hi.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.239
- How ya doin'?
- Oh.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.072
Remember, he said there were
only two pigs on board,

34:54.159 --> 34:56.435
but he was obviously lying.

34:56.719 --> 34:57.720
Hmm.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.434
Oh, and there are strange devices
on their boat!

35:00.520 --> 35:03.398
So, clearly, there's, you know,
some messed-up stuff going on here.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.799
How messed up? I don't know.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.757
What specifically?
I don't know that, either.

35:06.840 --> 35:07.840
Any questions?

35:10.200 --> 35:11.349
Sweet!

35:11.720 --> 35:13.950
You snuck onto their boat?

35:14.040 --> 35:15.951
Uh, you know, I don't need a reward.

35:16.040 --> 35:19.016
If you guys are trying to think of what
honor to bestow upon me, don't need it.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.837
- Boo!
- Yeah, boo 'em!

35:20.920 --> 35:22.399
Boo!

35:22.480 --> 35:23.959
- You're booing them or me?
- You!

35:24.160 --> 35:25.354
Oh, it's me.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.078
Perhaps I can explain.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.759
You see, my cousins are simple folk.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.560
Watch.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.870
<i>A, B, C...</i>

35:36.200 --> 35:38.031
Nothing. See? Nothing.

35:38.360 --> 35:41.318
I didn't want to risk their lives
until I found out that the...

35:41.400 --> 35:43.595
The new world was safe.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.353
We were gonna put on
a cowboy show for you.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.795
Let 'er go, boys! Yee-haw!

35:50.280 --> 35:53.113
<i>Hey, hey, you and me
Different as different can be</i>

35:54.320 --> 35:55.992
<i>...and I'll take the low...</i>

35:56.120 --> 35:57.600
<i>Ixnay on the ongsay.</i>

35:57.720 --> 35:59.153
- That was Pig Latin.
- Oh.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.470
- Ooh!
- But perhaps it wasn't meant to be.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.595
Oh.

36:02.720 --> 36:06.554
I believe that birds and pigs
are meant to be friends.

36:06.840 --> 36:10.958
But if we crossed boundaries
that were not meant to be crossed...

36:11.040 --> 36:12.040
Oh!

36:13.440 --> 36:18.514
Mr. Red, you've shamed not only yourself,
but our entire community!

36:18.600 --> 36:20.160
Oh, I think you... You messed up there.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.120
You said "shamed"
and you meant "saved," right?

36:22.200 --> 36:25.431
I sent you to treatment
to deal with your problems.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.875
Clearly, more treatment is required.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.519
- No!
- No!

36:29.600 --> 36:32.398
Do not trouble our honored guests again!

36:33.080 --> 36:37.358
My friends, we would love
to see your cowboy show.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.920
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.279
Thank you so much.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.896
Come on, everybody!

36:41.920 --> 36:42.955
Put your hands together!

36:43.040 --> 36:44.189
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

36:44.280 --> 36:46.236
Whatever. Don't listen to me.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.200
- Party train coming through!
- Choo-choo!

36:51.720 --> 36:54.792
<i>It's crazy that we're standing side by side</i>

36:56.040 --> 36:58.190
<i>Fighting just like two birds of a feather</i>

36:58.320 --> 37:00.390
Ah! I can't see. I can't see.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.549
Whoa!

37:01.640 --> 37:03.835
<i>Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?</i>

37:04.320 --> 37:07.676
<i>Just some roughed-up desperados</i>

37:08.720 --> 37:11.712
<i>Hanging tough through thick and thin</i>

37:12.880 --> 37:16.475
<i>Kicking up dust wherever we go</i>

37:17.520 --> 37:18.669
Whoa! Ho-ho-ho-ho!

37:18.760 --> 37:21.149
<i>I can see that you and me
Are gonna be friends...</i>

37:22.000 --> 37:23.149
Piggyback rides?

37:23.240 --> 37:24.719
Yee-haw! Let's move it, piggies!

37:24.840 --> 37:26.068
Oh, boy.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.912
Group picture! Group picture!

37:28.000 --> 37:29.592
Everybody say, "Cheese"!

37:29.680 --> 37:31.238
- Cheese omelet.
- Cheese!

37:31.320 --> 37:32.320
Cheese omelet.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.515
Classic.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.075
Ooh! Spoiler alert.

37:36.160 --> 37:37.434
- Step right up!
- Jump!

37:37.520 --> 37:39.750
So, I'm thinking about what kind of nest.
I don't know.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.990
I was in the store, and I saw this...

37:42.400 --> 37:43.515
<i>Whoa</i>

37:44.120 --> 37:45.678
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

37:46.080 --> 37:47.479
Yee-haw!

37:47.720 --> 37:49.915
- I am famished... Whoa!
- It's chow time!

37:51.280 --> 37:52.554
<i>Just some roughed-up desperados</i>

37:52.640 --> 37:55.029
Yuck!

37:55.160 --> 37:57.151
<i>Hanging tough through thick and thin</i>

37:57.240 --> 37:59.117
<i>Hanging tough
through thick and thin</i>

37:59.200 --> 38:02.510
<i>Kicking up dust wherever we go...</i>

38:02.680 --> 38:03.874
Yeah!

38:04.400 --> 38:05.435
Ow!

38:05.560 --> 38:07.152
What?

38:08.360 --> 38:12.194
<i>To the end
You and me are gonna be friends...</i>

38:14.040 --> 38:15.155
What the heck?

38:15.240 --> 38:18.232
Who invited you to move in?

38:18.320 --> 38:19.320
Hey! Whoa!

38:19.400 --> 38:20.799
That's my toothbrush!

38:20.880 --> 38:21.880
Get it out!

38:22.200 --> 38:23.792
Whoo! Yee-haw!

38:23.880 --> 38:25.950
Yee-haw!

38:33.160 --> 38:34.593
Huh?

38:36.400 --> 38:38.277
All right, class, thought for the day.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.112
Water is the softest thing,

38:40.200 --> 38:44.159
yet it can penetrate mountains and earth.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.117
Here's my thought of the day.
When are we done?

38:46.200 --> 38:51.513
Ugh! Red, what the caterpillar calls the end,
the world calls a butterfly.

38:51.640 --> 38:54.757
Can I just say I never understand
a single thing you're talking about?

38:54.840 --> 38:56.910
Can I just say...

38:58.040 --> 38:59.234
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.553
Ah. Mmm-hmm.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.229
Wow, that's very lifelike.

39:06.480 --> 39:08.072
- Whoa! Oh!
- So deep.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.273
And, Terence, let's see your...

39:11.360 --> 39:13.112
Oh! My goodness.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.034
- I did not know you felt that way.
- Aw...

39:17.120 --> 39:18.155
Uh, class dismissed!

39:18.240 --> 39:21.038
And now we've come to
the prestigious Palms district.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.155
Hoo-whee!

39:22.240 --> 39:26.995
Where birds of all feathers flock together
with eight kinds of fruit and nut trees.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.354
Suck those bellies in.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.440
Insta-ham!

39:29.480 --> 39:32.040
Hmm. Is that what I think it is?

39:32.120 --> 39:33.314
That's an egg.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.197
That's how our children are born.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.952
You guys don't lay eggs?

39:37.960 --> 39:40.076
I wish we did.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.116
<i>Enchanté.</i>

39:47.080 --> 39:49.958
You look delicious, my dear.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.791
<i>Every time you are near</i>

39:56.480 --> 39:58.436
<i>Just like me</i>

39:59.160 --> 40:01.310
<i>They long to be</i>

40:01.920 --> 40:02.920
That's us.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.229
Hey. Hello.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.576
Excuse me. Buddy?

40:09.600 --> 40:10.600
Those are fragile.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.520
Maybe you shouldn't pick 'em up, all right?

40:12.560 --> 40:13.788
- Not yours.
- Oh!

40:13.880 --> 40:15.711
My friend from the banquet.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.313
Well, that's a very good painting.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.629
Very good.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.875
Oh, yeah.

40:19.960 --> 40:23.316
Uh, the assignment was "Paint Your Pain,"
so I painted your pain.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.116
It's actually the first in a series.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.758
- Here you go.
- Uh-huh.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.353
- This one is nice.
- Oh.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.431
I call this one Catharsis.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.712
- And... Oh, I call this one <i>Bye-Bye.</i>
- Huh.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.479
Wonderful likeness.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.438
I thought you said
you stored your nuts for winter.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.317
Burn.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.096
All right, what's going on here?

40:44.120 --> 40:46.111
Are you explorers, or are you staying?

40:46.200 --> 40:49.158
Because if you're explorers,
then why are there more of you coming, huh?

40:49.240 --> 40:50.416
Hi, everybody!

40:50.440 --> 40:51.440
Whee!

40:53.520 --> 40:55.238
Not my house again!

40:55.400 --> 40:57.277
- That's my home!
- Okay!

40:57.360 --> 40:59.920
And you know what?
If you are staying, why don't you just say so?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.016
And why'd you leave your home?

41:01.040 --> 41:03.031
How do we know
you're not fugitives of the law?

41:03.120 --> 41:05.714
You are making our guests feel unwelcome!

41:05.800 --> 41:07.791
- And you're not asking basic questions.
- Oh!

41:07.880 --> 41:09.552
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.631
Your opinion is not needed!

41:11.720 --> 41:12.789
Why do we have to agree?

41:12.880 --> 41:14.336
Why does it matter that we're not the same?

41:14.360 --> 41:17.193
Anger is not always the answer!

41:17.360 --> 41:18.509
Continue the tour.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.031
Um, surf's up, you guys.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.998
- So, get ready to hang loose.
- That went well, if you're me.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.633
Dummy.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.117
We could really use you
right about now.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.239
Wait, actually...

41:37.200 --> 41:38.315
Hey, Chuck! It's Red!

41:38.400 --> 41:39.880
Zip on down here!

41:41.600 --> 41:43.272
Oh! Hey, Chuck's mom.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.918
Can your son come out to play?

41:46.560 --> 41:49.233
All of this does not
just happen on its own.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.839
Oh, hey. Just taking a shower.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.911
Bomb, buddy, TMI.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.576
Now, I'm telling you,
something isn't kosher with these pigs.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.635
Bull's-eye!

42:02.720 --> 42:05.029
And it's up to us to figure it out.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.519
Figure what out, exactly?

42:06.600 --> 42:08.336
I don't know,
maybe they're just being innovative.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.360
Go ahead.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.158
All aboard!

42:11.920 --> 42:13.400
Does seem a little odd, though.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.552
- Nailed it!
- Flawless.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.440
Come on, does none of this
seem wrong to you guys?

42:23.800 --> 42:26.320
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows
what these pigs are up to...

42:26.360 --> 42:28.112
- Hey!
- ...it's Mighty Eagle.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.108
<i>Mighty Eagle!</i>

42:32.800 --> 42:33.915
Oh, yeah!

42:41.440 --> 42:42.475
Ha-ha!

42:43.560 --> 42:45.471
Take that, tree! Hyah!

42:45.680 --> 42:47.238
Eat my foot! Oh-yah!

42:48.800 --> 42:50.791
Tasty! Yum, yum, yum! Mmm!

42:53.600 --> 42:54.600
Whoa.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.636
<i>Mighty Eagle!</i>

42:58.680 --> 42:59.749
Peek-a-boo.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.069
Hello, Bird Island!

43:09.000 --> 43:10.718
You're welcome.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.032
Does Mighty Eagle still live?

43:14.120 --> 43:15.120
Did he ever live?

43:15.160 --> 43:16.832
And if he did live, where would he live?

43:16.920 --> 43:19.639
By the Lake of Wisdom in the Ancient Tree.

43:19.720 --> 43:20.789
That's a fairy tale.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.108
I've run all over this island.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.428
Where could that possibly be?

43:23.520 --> 43:24.919
Way up high.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.750
It's a long way up that mountain,

43:29.840 --> 43:33.594
and if I'm being honest, well, I mean,
you know, I could kind of use your help.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.477
What's that? What are you trying to say?

43:35.560 --> 43:38.358
Nothing. I was just saying
that I, you know, I could use your help.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.715
Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you
over your ego.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.756
Could you enunciate
that last word a little bit?

43:42.840 --> 43:43.909
I need your help!

43:44.080 --> 43:46.753
Oh! Why didn't you say so?

43:46.840 --> 43:47.840
Bomb?

43:47.920 --> 43:49.638
Let's do it!

43:49.720 --> 43:51.199
Phew!

43:54.520 --> 43:58.752
If there is a Mighty Eagle, well,
how come we don't ever hear his battle cry?

43:58.840 --> 43:59.840
I don't know.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.029
Maybe we have.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.475
What would a Mighty Eagle
battle cry sound like?

44:03.560 --> 44:05.016
You know what? I think I got an idea.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.396
Maybe something like, uh...

44:08.520 --> 44:11.796
No, I bet it's more like... Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

44:11.880 --> 44:14.599
That's theoretically what
it's more like, scientifically.

44:14.720 --> 44:17.518
Oh, I got one.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.755
Ah.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.312
Not bad. It's a good impression.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.040
But in my head, I'm kind of imagining
it's something more like a...

44:25.200 --> 44:27.589
<i>Hey-you-ho!</i>

44:27.800 --> 44:29.950
<i>Hey-you-ho!</i>

44:30.360 --> 44:32.920
<i>Hey-you-ho!</i>

44:33.000 --> 44:34.035
That sounds about right.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.270
Now I'm thinking maybe
it's a little bit more subtle.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.696
Like a little bit just more majestic, like...

44:50.800 --> 44:53.030
<i>"Hello, world!</i>

44:53.120 --> 44:54.519
<i>"I am calling for you!"</i>

44:56.000 --> 44:58.355
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

44:58.440 --> 45:00.476
It's like running a nursery.

45:00.560 --> 45:01.993
Absolute child care.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.913
Someone has anger issues.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.634
This, uh... This is the wrong mountain.

45:16.240 --> 45:17.958
My calves are killing me.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.115
Whew!

45:45.200 --> 45:46.758
- Oh, wow!
- Whoa.

45:46.840 --> 45:49.434
That is simply unreal.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.750
The Lake of Wisdom.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.514
What are you guys waiting for?

45:59.240 --> 46:00.468
Guys, hurry up!

46:01.680 --> 46:04.069
This is what Mama talked about!

46:04.160 --> 46:06.390
Wow.

46:11.400 --> 46:12.435
Ah!

46:12.520 --> 46:14.715
Be honest, do I sound any wiser?

46:14.800 --> 46:16.438
Oh, way wiser.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.875
You were kind of dumb before.
I can say that now.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.393
That water is no joke.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.038
I can literally taste

46:22.120 --> 46:24.190
the intelligence and wisdom

46:24.360 --> 46:25.713
circulating through my body now.

46:25.800 --> 46:28.997
Guys, nobody's here.
I mean, nobody's used this place in years.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.509
What are you doing?

46:33.120 --> 46:34.348
Get out of there.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.550
Don't spit in his mouth.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.154
No, don't spit it back!

46:49.240 --> 46:51.117
Oh, don't swallow it.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.838
Yuck!

46:55.480 --> 46:56.480
Whoo!

47:01.240 --> 47:03.071
Whoa!

47:05.320 --> 47:07.470
Get out. Let's go. Come on.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.710
Shh, shh. Come. Take your time, will you?

47:09.800 --> 47:11.536
Red, I've found the meaning of life.
It's...

47:11.560 --> 47:12.879
Shut your wormhole.

47:34.760 --> 47:36.910
Oh, wow! It's him.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.115
Oh, man.

48:11.320 --> 48:13.629
No. No. No.

48:14.160 --> 48:15.160
Ew!

48:15.600 --> 48:19.229
Ugh! Horrible turn of events. Horrible.

48:19.640 --> 48:20.755
Whew!

48:35.080 --> 48:39.596
Well, not so much the Lake of Wisdom,
it's more like the Lake of Whiz.

48:39.680 --> 48:42.956
Did you just come here to look at me?

48:43.040 --> 48:45.918
Or did you have something to say?

48:47.000 --> 48:48.319
I think he saw us.

48:48.400 --> 48:49.469
Oh, you think so?

48:51.440 --> 48:54.193
You have passed the first test!

48:54.280 --> 48:55.838
You have found me.

48:55.920 --> 48:56.955
- Whoa, whoa!
- Look out.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.519
Behold.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.034
Gaze upon

49:01.120 --> 49:04.590
Mighty Eagle!

49:05.680 --> 49:07.591
Hmm?

49:08.200 --> 49:12.159
I see all and know all.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.514
What are your names?

49:13.600 --> 49:16.239
If you know all,
why don't you know who we are?

49:16.480 --> 49:17.480
Ow!

49:17.520 --> 49:19.875
- I know very well who you are.
- Uh-huh.

49:19.960 --> 49:24.556
You are lost souls
who have come here seeking wisdom.

49:24.960 --> 49:25.960
Whoa!

49:26.040 --> 49:27.393
Can we have some?

49:27.480 --> 49:31.189
Wisdom is not something that is given.

49:31.320 --> 49:34.198
It is something that is attained.

49:34.320 --> 49:35.878
Okay. Goodbye.

49:35.960 --> 49:39.236
No, no, no, no.
Will I help you attain wisdom?

49:39.320 --> 49:42.630
- Whoa! Ha-ha!
- Yes. That I will do.

49:42.800 --> 49:45.616
Right. So, the reason we've climbed
the mountain is that we want to know...

49:45.640 --> 49:47.790
- Prepare...
- Okay.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.434
...to have your minds blown.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.999
Oh, son of a...

49:52.080 --> 49:54.640
This guy is good.

49:54.760 --> 49:58.389
Welcome to the Hall of Heroism.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.790
Wow! It's really amazing to meet you.

50:00.880 --> 50:02.576
You know, I actually have your poster up...

50:02.600 --> 50:07.071
You might want to shield your eyes
from the sparkle of those trophies.

50:07.160 --> 50:09.674
How many? I have no idea.
Countless, I'm sure.

50:09.760 --> 50:10.795
Thirteen.

50:10.880 --> 50:13.758
Wow, this is way nicer
than my Hall of Wimpiness.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.229
Bring it home, mamacita.

50:16.320 --> 50:17.833
Get outta town.

50:19.400 --> 50:20.594
What the...

50:23.240 --> 50:24.673
Oh-oh-oh. Mmm-hmm.

50:29.200 --> 50:30.872
Those are some old-school moves there.

50:30.960 --> 50:32.188
Yeah.

50:32.280 --> 50:35.317
<i>Wild thing
Wild thing, wild thing</i>

50:35.400 --> 50:36.879
Ooh! Oh-ho.

50:37.080 --> 50:38.115
What?

50:38.200 --> 50:39.200
Wow!

50:39.720 --> 50:40.994
Yes!

50:41.080 --> 50:42.080
Yeah. Cha!

50:42.160 --> 50:43.957
<i>Hasta la vista, baby</i>

50:45.440 --> 50:48.876
So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.
You know, that doesn't mean he's not wise.

50:52.120 --> 50:55.192
Hey, are you tired of filling your balloons
with heavy old air?

50:55.320 --> 50:57.390
Finally, there's a better way.

50:57.480 --> 50:58.595
- Helium.
- Helium?

50:58.680 --> 51:00.432
It's a gas.

51:00.520 --> 51:02.670
Aw, don't worry about your balloon.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.876
It'll just land in the ocean.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.518
The fish love it.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.431
It's good for their tummy.

51:12.640 --> 51:16.076
Free party, free party.
It's gonna be the piggest party of the year.

51:17.560 --> 51:21.269
- Party! Get a birdsitter.
- Let's go, piggies.

51:21.360 --> 51:24.238
Well, now, that is some fine handiwork.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.231
- Hey, Judge, you're under arrest.
- What?

51:26.320 --> 51:27.878
For looking too good.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.109
Hello. What about me?

51:29.200 --> 51:30.713
Do... Do I get a plus one?

51:30.800 --> 51:32.950
- Oh! Thank you.
- Let me see, let me see.

51:34.360 --> 51:35.679
Oh, that was a wet one.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.629
Ooh!

51:48.600 --> 51:51.114
Almost there. Don't rush me!

51:52.880 --> 51:54.677
Deep breath, deep breath.

51:55.280 --> 51:58.113
And we're back in the now.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.519
Who's ready for trust falls?

51:59.600 --> 52:00.800
- I gotcha.
- No, no, no.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.355
Help.

52:05.520 --> 52:09.479
<i>Mighty, Mighty Eagle

52:18.560 --> 52:22.030

singing this song in school.

Um...

52:23.920 --> 52:25.990
Yeah. Yes, we did.

Um, right. Yeah.

<i>Mighty, Mighty Eagle</i>

52:38.720 --> 52:39.835
Come on.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.478
- Me?
- Yes.

52:41.560 --> 52:44.313

53:00.480 --> 53:01.515
Yeah!

53:01.600 --> 53:03.352

53:35.680 --> 53:38.558
Wow! You know it better than me.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.456
So, anyway, the other day,

53:40.480 --> 53:45.235
these pigs showed up out of nowhere,
and it caused me a great deal of suspicion...

53:45.320 --> 53:47.680
And he's walking out of the room.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.392
Unbelieve... I don't get this.

53:49.480 --> 53:52.790
This guy sits here on his butt, all alone,
clearly doesn't leave the house.

53:52.920 --> 53:56.071
He talks a good game, but he
doesn't care about anyone but himself.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.718
Sounds a lot like you.

53:57.800 --> 54:00.314
Oh, good.
Thank you for your opinion, Chuck.

54:02.800 --> 54:04.392
Hmm.

54:04.560 --> 54:05.959
Well, hello.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.474
- Hello? Mighty Eagle?
- What?

54:08.560 --> 54:10.039
- What are you doing?
- Uh...

54:10.120 --> 54:12.680
- I'm bird-watching.
- What?

54:12.760 --> 54:14.830
- Take a peek.
- Ah.

54:17.800 --> 54:20.439
- Oh, you're disgusting.
- Oh, yeah.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.511
Look, are you gonna help us or not?

54:22.600 --> 54:25.068
- I am helping you.
- No, this is you helping.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.230
Looking through binoculars,
spying on old ladies.

54:27.320 --> 54:28.833
Whoa, whoa! What is that?

54:30.200 --> 54:31.235
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:32.760 --> 54:34.432
Oh, my...

54:35.800 --> 54:38.189
I was right.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.599
I was right. I knew it!

54:39.680 --> 54:41.272
Bomb, Chuck, hurry up! Get out here!

54:41.360 --> 54:42.679
Uh-oh.

54:42.800 --> 54:45.155
Mighty Eagle, hey, fly us down there now.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.635
No.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.119
I'm sorry. What?

54:52.200 --> 54:54.270
I don't do that anymore. I'm retired.

54:54.360 --> 54:55.793
Mostly just tired.

54:55.880 --> 55:00.078
Go handle it yourself.
This is everything I've prepared you for.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.798
What? "Prepared us for"?

55:01.880 --> 55:03.199
Hold on, did I miss something?

55:03.320 --> 55:05.056
Let me just go through my notes
really quick. Let's see.

55:05.080 --> 55:07.469
Crazy stuff, bragging,
crazy stuff, karaoke.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.915
No, see, I don't see anything useful here.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.595
The whole world,
everyone we know, is in danger.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.954
Yes, it is.

55:15.080 --> 55:16.149
So, off you go.

55:16.240 --> 55:17.719
Hey, you know what?

55:18.680 --> 55:20.318
I used to believe in you.

55:22.240 --> 55:25.312
When I was a kid, I believed
nothing really bad could ever happen

55:25.400 --> 55:26.469
because you were here.

55:26.560 --> 55:31.076
And now I see the fate of the world
hangs on idiots like me.

55:31.160 --> 55:34.391
And that, sir, is sort of terrifying.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.591
It's time for you to go.

55:37.680 --> 55:40.831
You know, it's really upsetting to me
that you're the only bird that can fly

55:40.920 --> 55:42.160
and you're too afraid to do it.

55:44.760 --> 55:47.056
Hey, guys, come on, let's go.
We're done here. He's no hero.

55:47.080 --> 55:49.435
So, um, I'm having a party next Tuesday.

55:49.520 --> 55:50.616
Could you just do, like, a little pop in?

55:50.640 --> 55:51.640
Come on.

55:54.880 --> 55:55.880
Hmm.

55:56.240 --> 55:57.753
Come on, run faster!

55:59.720 --> 56:01.073
- Ow! Ow!
- Oh!

56:03.760 --> 56:05.955
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.

56:17.200 --> 56:20.590
I sentence you all
to four hours of hard partying.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.160
Look out below!

56:25.800 --> 56:27.711
Ooh!

56:27.800 --> 56:29.680
- They're taking the eggs!
- Follow 'em.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.788
Oh, man!

56:41.680 --> 56:42.715
Move it!

56:46.560 --> 56:49.074
Right on time. Eggcellent.

56:52.160 --> 56:53.878
Chuck, go shut that party down now!

56:53.960 --> 56:56.918
Me? But I only know
how to get parties started!

56:57.000 --> 56:58.228
- Go!
- On it.

56:58.320 --> 56:59.878
- Bomb, we gotta stop 'em.
- Yeah.

57:05.160 --> 57:06.991
Gotta get more speed!

57:10.480 --> 57:12.118
It's Chuck time!

57:13.360 --> 57:14.634
Get to the ship!

57:16.600 --> 57:18.352
Move 'em out!

57:18.920 --> 57:20.273
Catch.

57:23.480 --> 57:27.359
Can everybody please stop partying?
There are eggs being stolen!

57:30.280 --> 57:32.456
Matilda, we need your help.
The pigs are stealing our eggs!

57:32.480 --> 57:33.480
What?

57:33.560 --> 57:34.595
I'm airborne!

57:34.720 --> 57:37.075
We have to get back to the village!

57:37.160 --> 57:39.879
Stop dancing and start running!

57:40.240 --> 57:42.231
Hors d'oeuvres. My weakness.

57:43.200 --> 57:45.589
Come on, let's wrap it up.

57:45.680 --> 57:47.910
- We gotta get the eggs off the ship.
- Yes!

57:48.000 --> 57:49.456
- Is everyone on board?
- Let's go. Let's go.

57:49.480 --> 57:50.629
Use the trampolines.

57:52.960 --> 57:54.216
Can you get up there?

57:54.240 --> 57:55.958
We've got intruders!

57:56.040 --> 57:57.359
What the heck are they doing?

57:57.440 --> 57:59.556
Untie the ropes,
drop the eggs in the water.

57:59.640 --> 58:02.393
Get rid of 'em! Get him off of there!

58:03.680 --> 58:05.477
It's too strong. I can't break it.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.630
Ah! Bomb, blow up the chain.

58:08.320 --> 58:09.514
Knock 'em down.

58:11.400 --> 58:12.640
Come on, Bomb, you can do this.

58:15.640 --> 58:16.976
Come on, Bomb, you got this.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.035
Blow up.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.189
You gotta get me mad.

58:19.280 --> 58:21.111
Okay, well, then what makes you mad?

58:21.200 --> 58:23.316
Try insulting me on a personal level.

58:23.520 --> 58:26.637
Um... Oh, oh, uh... Your poetry stinks.

58:26.720 --> 58:29.154
You're just a bad poet. And you know it.

58:29.240 --> 58:31.879
I know! I know!

58:31.960 --> 58:33.678
Hey, who wants a birdie bath?

58:33.760 --> 58:35.352
Mmm!

58:42.000 --> 58:43.752
Oh, I'm sorry, Red. I couldn't do it.

58:43.840 --> 58:45.671
Don't give up. This isn't over.

58:45.760 --> 58:48.354
Thanks for your hospitality.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.920
Set sail for Piggy Island.

59:25.800 --> 59:28.109
Oh, no.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.599
We'll find them.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.918
Oh.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.159
Oh!

59:34.240 --> 59:35.389
They're all gone.

59:39.280 --> 59:41.316
Shh, shh. It's okay.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.713
Mr. Red.

59:55.760 --> 59:57.273
What do we do now?

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.238
Wait, hold on, you're asking me?

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.198
You knew. You tried to tell us.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.639
But we didn't listen.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.750
I didn't listen.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.351
Red, we need a leader.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.016
- What are we gonna do?
- What do we do now?

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.996
Wait a minute. I'm not a leader.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.275
Okay, pigs stole our kids. That sucks.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.112
Made all you guys look like idiots.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.553
You know what we gotta do?

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.712
We start replacing those kids.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.349
Ladies, get busy!

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.431
We're gonna be laying some eggs tonight.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.312
No, no, stop. No, no, no, no. No.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.277
We're not gonna replace those kids.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.634
We're gonna get them back.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.392
How are we gonna do that?

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.600
What do you mean how?
The pigs already showed us how.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.152
That is where they went.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.919
And so, that is where we're going.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.877
But how do we get from here to there?

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.110
I am not aquatic in the least.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.553
Well, uh, you know, uh...

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.871
We're gonna build our own boat.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.336
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.759
They stole your kids...

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.909
No.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.399
They stole our kids.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.471
I mean, who does that?

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.518
Have you ever stolen
anyone's children, huh?

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.431
Have you?

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.397
I mean, you look like you would.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.675
And you know what? I'm a little bit angry.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.593
Correction. I'm really angry.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.936
And I don't think I'm the only one.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.396
Come on, we're birds.
We're descended from dinosaurs.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.800
We're not supposed to be nice. Right?

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.833
Uh, yeah. Point... Point made.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.194
Who else here is angry?

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.599
- I am!
- Yeah, you are.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.199
We're getting our kids back.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.193
And I don't need any calm,
detached, happy birds.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.350
Not gonna help us. Don't need it.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.716
I need some angry flockin' birds.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.776
You hear me? Now, who's angry?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.950
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Let's go!

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.756
Bring me everything that floats.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.758
Yeah, yeah, that's perfect. Yeah.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.112
With every single feather of my being,

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.079
I am not gonna let any of these eggs
get taken from their parents.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.600
Chuck, I need you to
tie those crates together.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.640
You got it.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.752
Done and done.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.359
Uh, a little help here?

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.016
Let's go. Move it, everybody.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.712
Push with your upper body.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.917
I have no upper body!

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.479
Darn good for a bunch of birds.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.871
Whoo!

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.994
All right!

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.277
When I say, "Eat the," you say, "Eggs."

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.557
- Eat the...
- Eggs.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.432
Wow! What a reception!

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.431
All right, snouts up.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.677
Man, it's a snout staircase.
Who thinks of that?

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:07.036
Welcome home, King Mudbeard!

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.992
My father and my father's father
and my weird Aunt Chloe

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.196
- have all searched for the eggs.
- Hey!

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.272
- But only I, King Mudbeard...
- Ah!

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.475
My pom-pom.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.790
- ...have found them.
- We love you, Leonard!

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.313
I present to you the eggs!

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.596
Oh, man!

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.678
Say goodbye to Harvey.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.239
A feast!

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.232
I proclaim a feast two nights hence.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.029
Let's go make some omelets!

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.793
Oh, I feel a little nervous inside,
but that's normal, right?

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.199
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.040
Uh, anybody else got butterflies
in the stomach?

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.189
Yeah.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.320
Probably because
you ate too many caterpillars.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.995
Hmm... Mmm.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.718
Drop your nuts and move your butts!

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.912
Come on, let's go!

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.114
Oh, no.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.838
I wasn't expecting this.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.558
Oh, hold on a second.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.598
That guy's the king?

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.148
He's got to have the eggs
with him in the castle.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.136
- What the heck's a castle?
- And that's where we're going.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.516
Hey, guys, do you remember
everything you learned in my class?

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.640
- Yep.
- Nope.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.870
- What class?
- Well, forget all of it for now.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.712
Now it's time to let loose.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.760
Oh, good, because I never
learned anything anyway.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.456
Oh, me, neither.
I actually just came to socialize.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.799
I came for the snacks.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.598
You don't happen to have any now, do you?

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.035
Ooh! Deep breath, deep breath,
deep breath!

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.315
How are we gonna get over those walls?

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480
Uh...

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.393
I'll tell you how. We're gonna fly.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.240
Remember, the goal is the castle.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.958
Get to the castle.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.109
Who wants to go first?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.952
- Over here! Me! Me! Me!
- I do!

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.314
Hey! All right, Matilda.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.550
Aw! Always a bridesmaid.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.616
Step right up, keep your wings, legs and
feet inside the slingshot at all times.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.073
- Shoot it!
- Okeydoke.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.195
Fire!

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.393
And a one and a... Whoa!

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.799
Take that, porkers!

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.677
Incoming!

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.236
Boom, baby, boom!

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.435
Well, how about that?

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.511
My teacher can shoot fireballs
out of her butt.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.874
You! What's your name? Hal?

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.296
I've seen you
do something strange before, right?

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.117
Well, let's see, I'm really good at...

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.276
Doesn't matter. Launch him.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.749
Oh, this guy looks good.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.749
He's gonna make it!

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.508
This is incredible.
We're witnessing history right now.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.474
Nope. He's coming back.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.232
He's coming, duck. Get down.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.112
Uh, did we win?

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.111
Uh, no, not quite yet, buddy.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.033
We're still tied.
Hey, can we get an ice pack for Hal?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.111
- Medic!
- All right, who's up next?

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.350
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What can you do?

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.352
Ugh! Yuck!

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.754
Uh, need a tissue?

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.629
Who's next? We need fliers, not standbyers!

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.994
Let's go!

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.759
You go out there and you show them
how frightening mimes can be.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.875
Yeah!

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.792
Oh, my God!

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.640
<i>We're having a feast
We're eating the eggs</i>

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.789
<i>Gonna have a big feast</i>

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.194
<i>We're gonna eat all the eggs</i>

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.952
What?

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.309
What is that?

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.988
Fire!

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.798
That guy again. Ah!

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.308
Citizens of Pig Island...

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.598
...if you spot any birds
destroying your neighborhood,

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.511
please, capture them.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.398
- What did he say?
- There's been a change of plans.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.074
We will eat the eggs for lunch.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.470
Did he say, "Eat the eggs"?

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.918
Hmm. Mmm.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.235
Okay, I want you to curl
up into a little ball.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.833
All right? Make yourself aerodynamic.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.989
Like this?

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.150
- To the left. To the left!
- Let me at 'em!

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240
Launch!

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.153
Don't mess with Bubbles!

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.039
Get him!

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.792
- Piggy pile!
- Hog-tie him!

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.955
I told you not to mess with me!

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.871
Wow! That blows.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.439
In a good way.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.158
- To the left!
- Hold on, wait.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.633
My left or your left?

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.030
My left is your left.
We are facing the same direction.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.229
Right. Good call.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.232
Just look where the last bird went
and adjust from there.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.117
- I got this, you guys.
- All right.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.438
Hi-yah!

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.276
She got far, but not far enough.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.430
- Uh-oh.
- Get out of our town!

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.919
We have to get closer.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.670
Judge power...

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:22.395
- Oh!
- Trial by fire!

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:24.118
No, literally, he's on fire right now.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.519
Can somebody please help him?

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.032
<i>Gotta make you understand</i>

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.997
<i>Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down</i>

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.395
<i>Never gonna run around</i>

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:39.676
Mighty Eagle!

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:49.435
Terence, I got an idea.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.439
Do you think you can pull the slingshot
back far enough to hit that giant boulder?

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.750
Okay. Launch me
right towards the top of that thing.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:01.634
Ready?

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.997
Red, I'm not gonna lie to you. I am

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.799
really gonna miss you when you die.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.837
Rest in peace, my friend. Rest in peace.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.229
Hey, guys, let's not get cheesy, okay?

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:14.548
Ready? Fire!

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.109
This is gonna hurt.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.437
What was that? Huh?

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.908
My roof!

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.389
Did he make it?

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.995
I hope he's okay.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.399
I'm in!

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:37.630
Yeah. I knew he'd make it!

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.992
Send everyone else!

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.591
Guards! There is a red bird in these walls.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.716
Bring him to me.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.392
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Roger that, boss.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.716
Not in these walls.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.868
In the castle!

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.399
Come on, you guys.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.072
Here, pretty bird. Here, pretty bird.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Whew!

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.953
Transport the eggs!

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.429
Trot, trot, trot, trot, trot...

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.919
Launch me exactly the same way
you did for Red...

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.790
I wasn't ready!

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.108
Faster!

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.434
Chuck, is that you?

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.034
This is the house of horrors.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.880
I gotta be honest, you look a little, um...

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.120
Fine. You look fine. Come on.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.434
Bomb's on his way.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.359
Ouchie!

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.392
Ha! Call in the Piggy Air Force!

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.591
My loyal subjects,

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.797
the treacherous birds
have repaid our friendship

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.553
with an unprovoked act of aggression.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.835
The attack will fail.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.710
We have glass, we have wood, we have TNT.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.793
We tried to kill them with kindness,
and now we're just gonna have to...

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.677
- Well, you know.
- Bye-bye.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.033
Who's gonna go next?

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.199
Aim for that ramp.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.400
Terence! Terence! Terence!

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.310
No eggs in here.
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.719
Hey! Whoa! I'm on this.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.198
Redrum.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.990
Uh, never mind.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.468
Backup engines!

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.536
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, hold on a second.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.056
Wait, I know that rear end. That's Bomb.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.913
Yeah, Chuck, that's not his rear end,
that's his face, man.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.399
- Sorry, Bomb.
- No prob.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.277
Easy mistake to make.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.616
Thanks for getting me out.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.312
We want eggs!

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.757
We want eggs!

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.429
He was sick, but then he got cured.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.990
"No eggs in here."

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.399
Ooh, these are clever pigs.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.840
Okay, look, I'm gonna run up
and tackle the pig on the left.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.148
Bomb, you could handle two.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.753
Chuck, I don't know if you can help.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.717
We gotta figure out a way to get into that

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.836
roo...

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.320
...oo...

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:00.995
...oom.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.638
Anyone have any bright ideas?

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.397
Uh... Huh?

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.560
You are gonna pay for that.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.914
What the heck just happened?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.275
Oh, I'm sorry. You were saying?

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.430
And here we are?

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.397
We found 'em! Uh-oh.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.708
Aw, come on!

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.799
- Red!
- Guys, come on!

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.035
Quick, follow him.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.078
- We want eggs!
- Things are looking sunny side up!

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.390
Guys, I'm here. Everything's gonna be okay.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.576
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.976
- Hurry up, Bomb! Come on!
- I'm coming!

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.353
Don't lose me!

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.912
Doesn't this nightmare ever end?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.228
Oh, boy!

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.113
We want eggs!

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.192
What is he doing up there?
This is a civilized buffet.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.393
Huh?

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.473
Don't hatch now. Do not hatch now.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.750
Get that red scab off my eggs.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.717
- Hey!
- Oh, man.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.496
- Bomb, are you okay?
- Oh, I've been better.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.351
- We want eggs!
- Hmm.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.032
I'm gonna get a running start.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.596
Chuck time!

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.951
Fine. Boil him, too.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.838
Let's pig out!

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.434
Looks like it's just you and me,
pork belly.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.875
I'll be taking that. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.678
Hey! Oh!

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.829
No!

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.951
Red, we're coming!

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.553
Deep breath.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.633
Ow! I'm in!

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.517
Classy joint.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.079
Hello!

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.752
Where is everyone?

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.478
Mighty Eagle! Where's he going?

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.278
Oh, I can't believe I'm about to do this.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.479
Oh, my battle cry?

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.959
Coming in, coming in.

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.636
Mighty Eagle!

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.954
Whoa!

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.992
Whoa, whoa! Oh-ho!

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.953
Mighty Eagle.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.873
Mighty Eagle, wake up.
Come on. Oh, that's bad breath.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.191
I can sleep late, Mom.
It's not a school day.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.474
Throw them in the pot, too.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.199
I'll have the big turkey.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.999
Red!

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.350
- Hey!
- Whoa! What did I miss?

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.032
You gotta fly those eggs to safety.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.111
I got this. Here we go.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.951
Oh-ho! Whoa, oh!

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.429
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.509
My eggs!

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.671
- Don't forget Chuck and Bomb!
- Who?

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.800
- Hey!
- Those guys!

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.029
Right, right.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.118
Gotcha!

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.752
You're not getting away that easy.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.272
No!

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.592
- Save yourselves!
- Hold on, Red!

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.829
I'm gonna save that egg.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.037
- Red, don't be a hero. Red, no!
- No!

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.549
Huh?

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.153
Get out of town, everybody.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.998
- Whoa!
- Get down!

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.070
There's just so many of them!
We're outnumbered!

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.513
What? How many?

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.616
Oh, no, not that many.
Just the right amount, really.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.108
No need to look back.
Just keep flying. Faster!

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.634
I'll take that.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:42.948
- No, you won't.
- Get him!

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.359
Gimme that!

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.794
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.750
You just don't know when to stop, do you?

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.115
Here's a two-word answer... Uh-uh.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.317
Looks like your little
slingshot game ends here.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.913
- Gimme that!
- Not gonna happen!

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.155
Oh, no.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.234
Get out of my way!

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.157
Every pig for themselves!

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.309
I quit!

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.317
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoa!

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.879
Whoa!

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.874
I know what I gotta do.

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.439
I gotta blow up that ramp.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.318
And that would be a good plan
if you were good at blowing up.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.879
I need to stop those planes.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.791
Remember me, Chuck. Remember me!

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.518
Bomb's away!

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.429
- Oh, hi there.
- Here, chickie, chickie, chickie.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.033
This little piggy popped.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.711
This little piggy exploded.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.992
And this little piggy went,
"Wee, wee, wee, I want my mama!"

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.077
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.430
Come on, Bomb, you can do this.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.192
Blow up! Blow up!

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.600
Uh-oh.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.878
Oh, no.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.576
Think explosive thoughts.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.749
Surprise parties!

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.553
Yoga poses!

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.834
Pigs in airplanes!

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.748
I blew up.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.558
On purpose.

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.115
You're wrecking my house.
What's wrong with you?

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.519
You wrecked my house.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.600
Your house was ugly.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.715
Well, now we're even.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.189
Aw!

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.075
Strike!

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.115
Run! Run!

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.714
Guys, look out!

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.473
Everyone, stand back.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.754
Terence?

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.315
Put on your seat belts, everyone. Trust me.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.994
Well, this is dynamite.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.998
Hmm.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.993
- There you are.
- Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.309
Oh!

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.838
Delicious bird eggy-weggy. Ooh!

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.239
You can't eat eggs!

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.878
What are you gonna do? I'm a foodie.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.353
It's over. You're finished, Eyebrows.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.016
<i>Eyebrows!</i>

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.032
<i>Someone has anger issues.</i>

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.720
<i>Anger is not always the answer!</i>

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.078
Well, you know what?

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.434
I guess you win.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.635
What?

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.836
That was an awesome plan.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.273
Mindblower.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.954
Really? Well, thank you.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:52.316
You know, a lot of hard work
goes into my sinister plans.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.436
It does.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.596
Nah, I mean, your plan was great.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.113
But you didn't plan for this!

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.077
You have annoyed me for the last time.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.195
Yup.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.280
Ah!

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.755
No!

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.793
Faster!

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.231
Whoa!

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.315
Cramp. Cramp.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:42.509
It's him!

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.669
Look at that!

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.034
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.216
- Jeez, is that Mighty Eagle?
- It's him!

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.356
Wow, this guy looks
nothing like his statue.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.192
- Honey.
- Our eggs!

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.435
- Are you okay?
- Chuck, my man.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.431
- Did you see what I did back there?
- Yeah.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.519
Oh! This egg is the spitting image of you.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.790
There. Safe and sound.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.753
Oh!

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.496
Oh!

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.511
- Where is he?
- Red?

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.553
Where is he?

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.640
Oh!

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.631
I think he might be dead.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.311
Daddy!

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.072
He's alive!

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.718
He's alive!

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.359
What?

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.715
- Yeah!
- Oh-ho!

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.439
Red, you're alive! I thought you had died!

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.033
Or defected to the pigs' side.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.111
Hey, buddy, way to not be dead.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.758
Hey. It's good to see you guys.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.915
Come on.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.993
Sir. Ma'am.

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.517
I think these belong to you.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.233
Oh!

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.071
Thank you.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.597
Oh, Crimson, Woody, Ash.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.079
- Who?
- Is he talking to us?

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.390
You learned your lessons well.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.152
Come on, bring it in.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.376
No. I'm not really the affectionate type.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.270
Okay. Does it feel like
this is crossing the line to anyone else?

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.157
- Yup.
- Nope.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.708
You're my prize pupils.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.268
- Your prized what?
- Don't you see?

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.354
I had to make you lose faith in me so you
could learn to have faith in yourself.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.078
That's really not how it felt.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.160
Tell them, Rosy.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.056
Yeah, I don't think
that's what happened, man.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.355
Oh, look, he's blushing.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.756
I'm not blushing. I'm just red.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.870
Okay, who wants an autograph?

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.400
- Oh!
- Hoist it up.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.798
Nice.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.631
Hmm?

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.399
Hmm...

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.870
Grand reopening. Get your worms.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.840
Well done, indeed.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.600
Wow!

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.432
Is that you right there, Red?

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.715
Oh, really? Where? No.
They didn't have to do...

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.475
Oh, yeah.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.956
That's funny, I don't remember
crying on my knees like that.

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.076
But, you know, it's nice.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.391
Look at that.
They gave Mighty Eagle all the credit.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.233
They made him look
so much more handsome than you.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.834
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know, back when I was angry,

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.831
that would have really ticked me off.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.751
- Ah, forget about that.
- Ooh!

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.456
You know what we should do?
Let's go to the village.

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.595
Let's do it.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.136
No, actually, I'd love to
go hang out with you guys,

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.856
but, you know, I got this thing,
and I have another thing after that thing,

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.016
and there's all these
things in a row, so...

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.075
Would you look at that!

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.033
What the...

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:24.036
Mr. Red, welcome back to the village.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360
Mmm!

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.440
Ta-da!

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:51.840
Huh?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.834
<i>Mighty, Mighty Red
You rescued me</i>

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:03.194
<i>Defender of our homes
And liberty</i>

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.835
<i>- Bravery
- Humility</i>

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.150
<i>Anger-y</i>

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.877
<i>Mighty, Mighty Red You</i>

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.995
<i>Rescued me</i>

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.600
Oh, my God.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.120
Mmm.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Hmm?

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.360
How did you guys
find the time to pull this off?

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.296
This is why we went to
go get pedicures, isn't it?

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.754
Nope. We got pedicures
because we're worth it.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.956
- I got gels.
- You guys are something else.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.096
To be honest with you,
I am gonna miss the beach view.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.553
But so what? It's still there.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.136
It's just not right there when I wake up
and look out my window.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.958
Well, you can still look out your window
and see me and Bomb.

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.268
Right.

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.191
So, you know, pluses and minuses.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.554
Okay. See you later.

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.840
Oh!

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.073
Well, this just got awkward.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.639
That's really insensitive.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.073
Want to go get a bite?

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.118
- Forget it. Let's just go home.
- Hmm.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.514
Guys! I'm just messing with you.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:30.640
Get in here.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.336
- I knew it!
- Let's be roomies.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.590
Roommates!
Oh, I can't wait to make a chores list.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.800
Wait, hold on a second.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.136
I'll move my nest
in the master bedroom.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.536
Bomb, you can stay in the guest house.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.336
- No, no, no.
- Can we get a bunk nest?

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.856
- This is gonna be perfect!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.199
Guys! No!

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.188
<i>And how to get along</i>

01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.280
Oh, yeah.

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.032
<i>And so you're back from outer space</i>

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.155
Groovin' out.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.719
<i>I just walked in to find you here</i>

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:03.936
Watch this. Coming right at you.

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.216
<i>With that sad look upon your face</i>

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.071
<i>I should have changed that stupid lock</i>

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.151
<i>I should have made you leave your key</i>

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.151
<i>If I had known for just one second</i>

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.958
<i>You'd be back to bother me</i>

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.632
<i>Go on, now, go</i>

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.597
<i>Walk out the door</i>

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.477
<i>Just turn around now</i>

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:21.313
<i>'Cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.557
<i>Weren't you the one
Who tried to hurt me with goodbye?</i>

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:26.631
<i>Did you think I'd crumble?</i>

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.392
<i>Did you think I'd lay down and die?</i>

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.708
<i>Oh, no, not I</i>

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.800
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.960
<i>I will survive</i>

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.155
Whoo!

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.280
<i>As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive</i>

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.360
Mmm.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.680
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.160
<i>And I've got all my love to give</i>

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.676
<i>I will survive
I will survive</i>

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.751
Whoa. Whoa.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.632
<i>Go on, now, go
Walk out the door</i>

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.719
<i>Just turn around now</i>

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.995
<i>'Cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.256
<i>Weren 't you the one
Who tried to hurt me with goodbye?</i>

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.872
<i>Did you think I'd crumble?</i>

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.235
<i>Did you think I'd lay down and die?</i>

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.753
<i>Oh, no, not I</i>

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.592
<i>I will survive</i>

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.078
Come on, Leonard.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.673
Leonard can't dance.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.228
He's hatching a new plan.

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.673
Yeah!

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.557
<i>I will survive</i>

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.596
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.200
Okay, maybe I'll dance for just a sec.

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.711
Whoo! Show 'em what you got, Red.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.592
Ba-boom! Come on, Red Stuff.

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.749
- No.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:32.875
Nice try.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.629
Hmm?

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.040
Uh...

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.680
Oh! Okay.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.760
Mmm-hmm.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.399
<i>Ooh! Whoa!</i>

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:51.313
<i>I will survive</i>

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.479
<i>I will survive</i>

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.959
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.679
<i>I will survive</i>

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.036
<i>Yeah</i>

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.109
There you go.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.636
- Ooh!
- Wait. What are we doing?

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.309
Watch out.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.635
Ow!

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.513
Whoa!

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.033
Mmm!

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.669
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.675
<i>There's a moment in this journey
that I gave up</i>

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.718
<i>My boots just couldn't walk another mile</i>

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:21.469
<i>And that cloud above me
had no silver lining</i>

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:25.598
<i>I couldn't buy a break with my last dime</i>

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:30.235
<i>Oh, but when I saw you
standing in the corner</i>

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:34.835
<i>I'd have never thought
that you would have my back</i>

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:39.189
<i>But then we rolled in
like the thunder and the lightning</i>

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.074
<i>Threw some punches, then we had a laugh</i>

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.989
<i>Just some roughed-up desperados</i>

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:52.435
<i>Hanging tough through thick and thin</i>

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.635
<i>Kicking up dust wherever we go</i>

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:01.798
<i>I can see that you and me
are gonna be friends</i>

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.197
<i>Who'd have thought
we'd wind up here together?</i>

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.591
<i>It's crazy that we're
standing side by side</i>

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.071
<i>Fighting just like two birds of a feather</i>

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.476
<i>Who's gonna tell us now
that we can't fly?</i>

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.795
<i>Just some roughed-up desperados</i>

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:34.235
<i>Hanging tough through thick and thin</i>

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:38.594
<i>Kicking up dust wherever we go</i>

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:43.069
<i>I can see that you and me
are gonna be friends</i>

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:47.519
<i>To the end, you and me are gonna be friends</i>

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.074
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.479
<i>Here we go!</i>

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.758
<i>Hey, hey, you and me
Different as different can be</i>

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.070
<i>You like to rock, I like to roll</i>

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.151
<i>You take the high and I'll take the low</i>

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.869
<i>Whoa, whoa-oh!</i>

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.150
<i>Whoa, whoa-oh!</i>

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.036
<i>Just some roughed-up desperados</i>

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.515
<i>Hanging tough through thick and thin</i>

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:24.829
<i>Kicking up dust wherever we go</i>

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:29.355
<i>I can see that you and me
are gonna be friends</i>

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.919
<i>To the end, you and me are gonna be friends</i>

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.268
<i>I can see that you and me
are gonna be friends</i>

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.520
<i>Yeah!</i>
