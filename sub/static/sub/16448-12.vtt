WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.904
Okaaaay!

00:03.971 --> 00:06.540
Ta-da!

00:08.109 --> 00:09.910
Yeah, you know, Mom,
I don't want to be negative,

00:09.977 --> 00:11.912
but that chimney
is way too big.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.714
Yeah,
the roof's gonna cave.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.217
Why don't we just use the kit,
like we always do?

00:16.284 --> 00:19.120
Because,
Jack, look -- number 5
on my Christmas to-do list,

00:19.187 --> 00:21.922
"Make a gingerbread house
from scratch."

00:21.989 --> 00:23.657
And here it is!

00:23.724 --> 00:25.926
And it's beautiful!

00:25.993 --> 00:28.796
A gingerbread house!

00:28.862 --> 00:29.763
Yeah!

00:29.830 --> 00:32.633
Oh. The chimney's
quite large.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.902
It's like a guard tower.
[Laughs]

00:34.968 --> 00:37.938
Are the elves planning
on escaping? [Chuckles]

00:38.005 --> 00:39.873
You could put
a little Army man on top,

00:39.940 --> 00:41.709
and he could just
cut them down one by one.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.144
[Imitates gunfire]

00:43.211 --> 00:44.212
Aah! Aah!

00:44.278 --> 00:45.813
[Imitates gunfire]
Aah!

00:45.879 --> 00:46.814
[Laughs]

00:46.880 --> 00:49.183
Whoo! Aaaaaah!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.951
Aaaaaaah!

00:51.018 --> 00:53.354
Then little knives
chase out.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.523
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:55.589 --> 00:58.726
Hey! I thought you were
gonna get those lights up.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.929
Oh, I was
until I saw...this.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.766
Then I thought I'd untangle it
sitting in my chair.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.535
Which kind of
led me to...

01:07.601 --> 01:09.403
sitting in my chair.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.973
All right, but Christmas
is just around the corner,

01:13.040 --> 01:15.443
and I want to get
everything done on my list.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.444
Your list?

01:16.510 --> 01:17.711
Yeah!

01:17.778 --> 01:18.846
Now that you're retired,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.981
we have time
to do Christmas right.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.284
Were we doing it wrong?

01:23.351 --> 01:25.419
Wake up, we go to Mass.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.954
We open our presents.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.056
There was a ham involved.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.991
Seemed right.
Felt right.

01:31.058 --> 01:34.362
Just take a look at the list
before you decide you hate it.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.063
Okay, I hate it.
No.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.798
Read it.
[Sighs]

01:37.865 --> 01:40.000
I guess I could do
a couple of these, all right?

01:40.067 --> 01:41.535
N-- Uh-uh.
No, no, no, no.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.237
I'm not putting
that Santa sleigh on the roof.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.438
Come on! It's pretty.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.475
Pretty? That thing
is a death machine.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.310
["12 Days of
Christmas" plays]

01:54.948 --> 01:56.717
Donna: Ooh, honey!
Are you okay?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.386
[Strained]
How do they look?

02:08.396 --> 02:09.830
[Thud]
Honey, are you okay?!

02:09.897 --> 02:11.031
[Groans]

02:11.098 --> 02:14.001
Honey, maybe we should wait.
It just rained.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.503
It's fine.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.038
[Electricity crackles]

02:18.105 --> 02:18.839
Aah!

02:18.906 --> 02:20.441
Ooh! Honey, you okay?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.109
My teeth are hot!

02:25.313 --> 02:27.114
Yeah, okay.
That's off the list.

02:28.516 --> 02:34.255
* I am not your ordinary guy

02:34.322 --> 02:36.490
I'm so glad that we're all
finally getting together.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.058
And, Mott, you look
very handsome in your suit.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.159
Thank you.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.262
Kind of like Bigfoot
at a bar mitzvah.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.133
I'm sorry, guys.
Can we just order?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.368
I know it's gonna be
a matter of time

02:47.435 --> 02:50.504
before we get
the phone call.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.173
When you have seven kids,
babysitters tend to quit --

02:53.241 --> 02:54.375
sometimes, mid-shift.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.043
Sometimes before
you get out of the driveway.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.078
Those are the ones
that just break your heart.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.214
Oh, Cindy, I don't know
how you do it.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.882
You know when the light
turns yellow

03:01.949 --> 03:04.184
and you just
don't know whether
to speed up or slow down,

03:04.252 --> 03:05.986
so you just
kind of tense up?

03:06.053 --> 03:08.088
That's where I live.

03:08.155 --> 03:11.091
Right in the yellow light.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.893
And I'm sure
this guy's of no help, huh?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.328
[Laughs]

03:14.395 --> 03:16.897
He's not -- at all.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.098
He makes things harder.

03:18.165 --> 03:21.101
Every...single...day.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.636
Making casual conversation.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.705
Not looking for the real.
[Laughs]

03:24.772 --> 03:27.107
But you do a great job
with those kids, you know?

03:27.174 --> 03:29.209
We only have three,
and that'sa handful.

03:29.277 --> 03:32.813
Sometimes
seven can feel like...

03:33.914 --> 03:35.115
It's just a lot.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.184
I'm sure it is,
with an army like that.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.486
[Chuckles] My gosh.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.421
I'd be freaking out,
looking for a hiding spot.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.124
Especially during Christmas?
Whoo!

03:44.191 --> 03:46.126
But then, soon, they're gonna
all be out of the house,

03:46.193 --> 03:47.695
and then you won't
have to worry anymore.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.830
Mm, I don't know
if I agree with that.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.499
It's okay if you do.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.133
I mean, little Louie --

03:53.200 --> 03:54.335
he's not gonna be
out of high school

03:54.402 --> 03:56.036
till the year 2030, right?

03:56.103 --> 03:57.271
Guy.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.339
Yeah, you know what?
We should just all order.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.007
Everything looks
so good.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.075
'Cause out of
the seven kids,

04:02.142 --> 04:04.077
two are definitely coming back
to live at home, you know?

04:04.144 --> 04:05.145
They're not all
gonna be winners.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.847
It's just a fact.
We've all seen it.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.216
The 26-year-old
living in the basement, right?

04:09.283 --> 04:11.619
He's got the Camaro parked
on the front lawn.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.020
You guys are probably
never gonna be

04:13.086 --> 04:15.623
in the house alone again --
ever.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.157
What are we gonna do?
Are we gonna do potato skins?

04:17.224 --> 04:19.293
Let's do -- Hey, you know
the ones that come with bacon

04:19.360 --> 04:21.094
a little longer,
'cause they get
the bacon in the bottom...

04:21.161 --> 04:22.863
And....she's gone.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.732
She's what?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.099
Where's she going --
the bathroom?

04:26.166 --> 04:28.402
Whenever somebody reminds her
how hard her life is,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.237
she just gets upset
and leaves.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.439
[Sighs]

04:31.505 --> 04:32.606
Usually it's me.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.542
This time, you.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.177
Where --
Where does she go?

04:37.244 --> 04:40.814
Sometimes to her sister's.
Sometimes a casino.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.182
I-I-I-I feel horrible.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.351
I mean, I really --

04:43.417 --> 04:45.085
Should I run after her
and apologize, or...

04:45.152 --> 04:47.455
No. It's like
chasing an ostrich.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.089
If she knows
you're following her,

04:49.156 --> 04:51.058
she'll turn around
and run right at you.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.195
Well, I mean,
this is awkward.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.764
What do we do now?

04:56.830 --> 04:59.733
I mean, if we stay, we should
probably get the potato skins.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.776
Oh, you going outside
to put the lights up?

05:08.842 --> 05:10.811
Ah, no.
Mott called.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.279
He needs me
to pick up some stuff.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.815
Cindy's still not back.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.750
Hey, guys. I got some presents
for the kids.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.818
Anything for me?

05:17.885 --> 05:20.253
All right,
see you later.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.422
Thank you, Kyle.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.090
You can just put them
on the table.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.225
We don't have a tree yet,
but it's on the list.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.161
Yeah, well, you know,
when you live alone,
you don't get a tree.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.931
For the same reason you don't
get a second kitchen chair

05:30.998 --> 05:32.433
or another fork.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.469
But you're coming here
for Christmas Eve, right?

05:35.536 --> 05:36.837
I am, yeah.
[Chuckles]

05:36.904 --> 05:38.138
And then
on Christmas Day,

05:38.205 --> 05:40.508
I wake up and I watch
"Home Alone," you know?

05:40.574 --> 05:43.076
At home, alone.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.380
What do you got here?

05:46.447 --> 05:48.549
Oh, Kevin
was supposed to do that.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.150
Really?
I'll do it.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.251
Yeah?
Yeah!

05:51.318 --> 05:52.386
The boys down
at the firehouse,

05:52.453 --> 05:55.122
they call me
"the untangler."

05:55.188 --> 05:57.257
This is gonna
keep me busy for hours.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.461
All right, well, think of it
as an early Christmas present.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.896
I will, and I do.
Thank you.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.738
Found this outside.
I assume it's yours?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.372
There you are!

06:12.440 --> 06:14.341
See, this is why
you kids can't have a dog.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.810
You can't even
keep Louie inside.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.211
I got you
your groceries.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.848
You are all set here, buddy,
so I will talk to you later.

06:20.914 --> 06:21.982
Guy,
listen, I'm late for work.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.083
I got nobody to
watch the kids.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.251
You gotta help me out.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.385
I gotta tell you --

06:25.453 --> 06:26.720
I really think they can
take care of themselves.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.256
Come on, guy, it's kinda
your fault my wife bolted.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.424
I-I don't think it was --

06:30.491 --> 06:32.192
Kids, Uncle Kevin's
gonna babysit you guys

06:32.259 --> 06:33.927
for a few hours,
so let's not have another

06:33.994 --> 06:35.929
"Lisa from down the street"
incident.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.565
What happened to Lisa
from down the street?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.733
These guys say she slipped.
She says she was pushed.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.769
Ultimately,
the judge will decide.

06:41.835 --> 06:49.743
[Kids shouting]

06:49.810 --> 06:52.680
And salami, salami, salami.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.415
And dealer gets...
double salami.

06:55.483 --> 06:58.686
We also gotta assume
the dealer has double salami.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.321
Okay, who's up for cheese now?
Raise your hand.

07:01.388 --> 07:02.456
Hit me!
Oh, I like it.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.057
Riverboat Sally's
in for cheese.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.325
We got some cheese
over there.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.094
We got some cheese
in the back corner here.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.129
All right. That's great.
Okay.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.397
That's your fifth
piece of cheese.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.799
That's why
you're so big.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.868
Um, no, it's actually because
I have a slow metabolism.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.638
No, you just eat a lot.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.307
You know, your father
weighs just as much
as I do, by the way.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.409
Yeah, because
he's twice your height.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.078
Why are you
sweating so much?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.614
All right, everybody,
let's just eat our sandwiches.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.081
Go eat your sandwiches,
everybody.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.216
Nobody's eating.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.786
We want Chipotle.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.722
Okay, you know what?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.590
I'm not sure
that type of attitude

07:36.657 --> 07:39.627
is gonna fit with the season,
because Santa Claus is coming,

07:39.693 --> 07:42.362
and I think we all know
what that means.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.231
Ooh! What?

07:44.297 --> 07:47.367
"Santa's" not gonna
bring me my presents?

07:47.434 --> 07:48.836
Not if I call him.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.304
Do it.
See if I care.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.373
Okay. I will.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.441
[Chuckles]
Which one are you?

07:54.508 --> 07:55.843
Randi, with an "I."

07:55.909 --> 07:57.845
Okay, Randi with an "I."

07:57.911 --> 07:59.312
[Clears throat]

07:59.379 --> 08:00.380
It's ringing.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.916
Put it on speaker.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.652
Okay, I don't care.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.386
Here you go.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.355
Hello?

08:08.421 --> 08:09.857
That's sonot Santa.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.024
I know it's not Santa.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.694
T-That's Chale,
one of Santa's elves --

08:13.761 --> 08:16.263
who lives in Santa's garage.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.798
Yes, I'm Chale.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.601
And I am an elf.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.403
Your father and I
are role-playing.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.005
Why?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.273
I don't know.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.474
Hey, Chale, listen.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.643
I got a little Randi Mott
over here,

08:29.710 --> 08:31.612
and she's not eating
her sandwich

08:31.679 --> 08:34.181
and she's thrown out
some hurtful comments.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.550
Uh, just not sure we should
bring her some presents

08:36.617 --> 08:38.385
this year, you know?

08:38.451 --> 08:39.720
Hmm.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.656
Sounds like she's a candidate
for the naughty list!

08:42.723 --> 08:43.657
[Laughs]

08:43.724 --> 08:45.659
Yes, that's what
I was thinking, as well.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.795
Uh, could you call Santa
and let him know that?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.296
I'm sorry!

08:49.362 --> 08:50.230
Hang up!
What?

08:50.297 --> 08:51.665
Hang up!
Okay.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.000
You can eat!

08:53.066 --> 08:54.902
Eat!

08:54.968 --> 08:55.869
Eat!

08:55.936 --> 08:58.338
Next time,
don't poke the bear,

08:58.405 --> 09:00.373
Randi with an "I."

09:04.377 --> 09:08.081
[Vocalizing
"Deck the Halls"]

09:08.148 --> 09:10.651
Kyle! You did, like,
three things on my list!

09:10.718 --> 09:11.451
Thank you.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.853
Oh, I'm glad you're happy.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.454
And I know how much
you love hot toddies,

09:14.521 --> 09:16.890
so I whipped us up
a little batch.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.726
Oh, wow!

09:18.792 --> 09:20.694
Cinnamon stick,
whipped cream --

09:20.761 --> 09:22.930
Did you put cloves
in the lemon?

09:22.996 --> 09:25.232
They didn't
put themselvesthere.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.466
Oh, this is amazing.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.335
I can't get Kevin
to do any of this stuff.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.005
Oh, and I noticed that your
chimney was caked with soot.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.776
And, uh, I think you know
how I feel about fire safety.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.611
So, uh, let me
take care of that,

09:37.678 --> 09:41.448
so you can have the fire
you deserve on Christmas.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.487
Are you crying?

09:47.554 --> 09:49.156
I'm just happy.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.762
Hey.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.864
[Sighs]
Sorry I am late.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.498
Man!

09:58.565 --> 10:00.567
Trying to get a house
full of kids to sit down
and do their homework

10:00.634 --> 10:01.735
is a production.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.870
You have no idea!

10:04.638 --> 10:06.874
I have someidea.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.075
Bad news.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.109
Huh?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.644
Cindy got snowed in
at the casino,

10:10.711 --> 10:12.946
and Mott asked if I could
hang out until she got back.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.748
Okay, well, you know,
take all the time you need,

10:14.815 --> 10:17.250
'cause your brother is just
moving through the list.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.518
I mean,
Kyle is amazing.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.619
He does all this work.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.655
He doesn't complain
or drag his feet.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.523
I'm so happy for you,
honey.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.292
You finally got
what you wanted.
That's awesome!

10:25.358 --> 10:30.530
[Giggling] I did!

10:30.597 --> 10:31.732
Hey, guy.
Sorry I'm late.

10:31.799 --> 10:32.733
[Keys clank]

10:32.800 --> 10:34.634
Yeah.
You want some dinner?

10:34.702 --> 10:37.437
Actually, I stopped at Enzo's
for a slice.

10:37.504 --> 10:40.107
Good. 'Cause I threw your
meatloaf in the garbage, okay?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.542
You can't text me? You can't
let me know what's going on?

10:42.609 --> 10:45.545
I tried. A-Actually, I think
there's
a cellphone tower down.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.814
I couldn't get a signal.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.549
Really, Mott?
I taughtyou that excuse.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.551
Oh. Right. Sorry.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.486
Anyway,
the place looks great.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.155
I love seeing all the kids
getting along,

10:55.222 --> 10:56.556
making
their little ornaments.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.691
That's 'cause they thought
they were going

10:57.758 --> 11:00.460
for their Christmas tree
tonight.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.562
You know what?
Let's just do that tomorrow.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.197
I'm exhausted.
I worked all day.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.834
Oh, and I didn't
work all day?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.335
You know what?

11:08.401 --> 11:11.004
I'm starting to see why Cindy
likes the casino so much.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.572
I said I'm sorry.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.108
You think I like being the
finger wagger? 'Cause I don't.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.643
I like having fun, too,
you know.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.681
Look, y-you know what?
You're right.

11:21.749 --> 11:22.816
Let's do this.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.018
Let's get the tree.
Come on.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.586
Look, it's too late,
all right?

11:26.653 --> 11:29.222
Three of the kids
are already in PJs.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.657
We can go tomorrow.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.026
You really mean it?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.129
You're not just saying?
Don't bring my hopes up again.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.197
Don't you do that.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.300
I promise.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.771
Okay, just text me
next time.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.241
Meatloaf's in the fridge.
I didn't really throw it out.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.614
Hey, Kyle.
what are you doing?

11:54.681 --> 11:57.184
Oh, I'm just organizing
the mail area.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.019
Oh, you don't need
to do that.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.654
Well, I ran across some
old credit card statements.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.223
A couple things
jumped out at me.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.994
Uh...you really
shouldn'tbe doing that.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.263
And youshouldn't be spending
so much on groceries.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.200
Don't be ashamed
of coupons, Donna.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.069
That's, um...
that's pretty invasive.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.204
[Chuckles nervously]

12:17.270 --> 12:18.638
All right.
Okay.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.640
I'm sorry. I don't wanna
overstep my bounds.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.009
Thank you.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.878
Oh. But you should know
that Jack and I had the talk.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.546
What talk?

12:26.613 --> 12:28.515
You know, the talk --
the birds and the bees.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.719
He's only 10.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.221
Well,
he asked me about bees,

12:34.287 --> 12:36.489
so I thought it was his way
of hinting around.

12:38.725 --> 12:42.796
He's doing a report on bees
for school.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.832
Well, he might have
more info than he needs.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.204
[Sighs]

12:51.271 --> 12:52.672
Hey, babe.
Hey.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.474
I'm gonna have
a glass of wine.
You want one?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.543
Oh, I probably shouldn't.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.446
Got so much laundry
to do.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.981
These grass stains
are just killing me!

13:01.048 --> 13:02.549
It's like,
what does Mott do?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.684
Just walk out the front door
and fall down?

13:04.751 --> 13:07.320
Well, a little tip
is next time, presoak.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.889
Ooh!
That's a good one.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.724
You know what? Maybe I will
have some of that wine.
Okay.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.893
Live a little.
Yeah. Yeah.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.961
You know what it is?

13:14.027 --> 13:16.329
I'm just tired
of feeling invisible.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.697
If I'm not cooking,
I'm cleaning.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.699
If I'm not cleaning,
I'm doing laundry.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.169
And do I ever
hear a thank-you?
No, I do not.

13:23.770 --> 13:27.640
Well, last night over here,
Kyle did the dishes.

13:27.707 --> 13:28.842
Oh, that's nice.

13:28.909 --> 13:33.580
Yeah, because he said
I looked tired.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.714
He did not say that
to you.

13:34.781 --> 13:35.815
He did.

13:35.883 --> 13:36.984
Okay, and you know what?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.718
Even if I do like tired,
I don't wanna hear that.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.720
It's like, I wanna hear
I look...

13:40.787 --> 13:41.488
Radiant!

[Glasses clink]

13:43.823 --> 13:45.725
Ugh.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.127
Well, at least
you're hearing something.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.595
Mott doesn't even talk.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.729
Yeah, that's right.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.431
And I'm not gonna
compete with the TV.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.666
I can't.
I just won't.

13:53.733 --> 13:54.701
[Buzzer]

13:54.767 --> 13:55.969
Oh, great --
another load of whites.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.837
By the way,
they're not gonna be white.

13:57.905 --> 14:04.111
I'm gonna tell you that
right now.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.113
Kevin: Everybody
stick together, okay?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.747
Big kids,
watch the smaller ones.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.749
And if you see a tree
that's taller than your dad --

14:09.816 --> 14:11.451
probably too expensive.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.360
Hey, isn't that
your other family?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.695
It is.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.768
Shopping for a tree
without me?

14:28.835 --> 14:31.404
Honey, I texted you.
You never texted me back.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.772
I'm taking care
of seven children!

14:32.839 --> 14:34.307
I...

14:34.374 --> 14:36.143
Well, the kids,
they really wanted a tree.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.377
I had to pull
the trigger.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.778
But look at this.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.780
Look.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.815
It's a completed
Christmas list.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.485
I've never had
one of these before.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.220
I might have your brother
frame it for me.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.588
Donna!

14:48.655 --> 14:50.157
Donna, the guy's
tying it to the roof.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.791
Come on. Ticktock.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.626
Hey, Kev.

14:57.864 --> 14:58.999
So, I should...

14:59.066 --> 15:00.867
Yeah.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.537
You look good.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.872
You look good, too,
Donna.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.276
So, I'll see you soon?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.243
Yeah.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.945
Back home,
where we both live.

15:22.655 --> 15:23.890
Hey, kids.

15:23.957 --> 15:27.527
Uncle Kevin has something
he wants to say to you.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.297
As you know,
I have my own family,

15:30.363 --> 15:33.266
and...I'm going back to them.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.635
But that doesn't mean

15:35.702 --> 15:38.838
there won't be a place for you
always in my heart.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.308
Can't you just stay
for two more days?

15:41.374 --> 15:44.544
Oh, Randi,
I'm gonna miss you.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.945
I know we got off
to a rough start

15:46.013 --> 15:48.281
with the relentless
weight jokes.

15:48.348 --> 15:52.719
That was only because I really
do worry about your health.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.087
I know you do.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.356
And thanks
for the pamphlets.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.427
Look, guys, this is gonna be
great now, all right?

16:00.493 --> 16:01.861
I mean, your dad,
he's gonna --

16:01.928 --> 16:03.563
He's gonna do a lot more
around here.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.866
And...well, I'm just...

All right, guys,
come bring it in.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.807

Yeah!

17:22.942 --> 17:24.144
So, what's next?

17:24.211 --> 17:26.045
Well, I was thinking
we could all gather 'round

17:26.113 --> 17:28.815
and I will read
"A Christmas Carol."

17:28.881 --> 17:31.151
I do all of the parts,
and fair warning --

[High-pitched]
My Tiny Tim is a tearjerker.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.959

Christmas classic "Die Hard."

"Die Hard"!

17:47.400 --> 17:48.868
What was that?

17:48.935 --> 17:51.238
Huh.
Maybe it was Santa.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.440
Well, it's definitely
not the stork bringing a baby,

17:53.506 --> 17:54.974
'cause that's a lie.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.743

about the sleigh.

I got the sleigh up there.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.645
[All scream]

18:32.712 --> 18:33.413
Oh, no!

18:33.480 --> 18:37.384
[Weakly] I'm fine.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.220
Spending a couple days
at the Motts' taught me --

18:40.287 --> 18:43.022
I really don't appreciate
all you do for me around here.

18:43.089 --> 18:46.025
And I just want you to know --
from now on,

18:46.092 --> 18:49.061
I'm gonna start doing
a lot more for you.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.663
Well, having your brother here
for a few days

18:50.730 --> 18:52.031
made me
a lot more thankful

18:52.098 --> 18:56.503
for how little
youdo around here.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.738
He tends to go overboard.
I know.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.039
At least
you finished your list.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.174
[Gasps]
Isn't it nice?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.242
Yeah.
Everything's done!

19:02.309 --> 19:03.676
And now we can
just sit here,

19:03.743 --> 19:06.045
with the tree
and the decorations,

19:06.112 --> 19:08.014
and just relax.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.482
It's pretty great.
Yeah.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.323
Your brother's at the window,
isn't he?

19:16.389 --> 19:18.124
Yeah, he's there.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.928
Shouldn't we
just let him in?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.030
No, no. It's like
feeding a stray cat.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.433
You can't do that.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.201
Babe.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.303
All right, fine.
It's Christmas.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.471
Go around!

19:31.538 --> 19:35.942
Go around!

19:36.008 --> 19:39.078
* Don't want no
sweet perfume *

19:39.145 --> 19:42.782
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

19:42.849 --> 19:45.318
* Do, do, do, do, do

19:45.385 --> 19:46.653
* Do, do, do, do

19:46.719 --> 19:50.056
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

19:50.122 --> 19:53.125
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

19:53.192 --> 19:55.027
* I just don't want no...
