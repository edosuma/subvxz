Retail is in freefall.

the one that starts off,

24:32.347 --> 24:37.477
"Richard Carl Fuisz was born
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,

24:37.477 --> 24:39.646
to Slovenian immigrants."

24:39.646 --> 24:41.857
Is that accurate?
- I would say yes.

After I sold my company,

I went back to Pennsylvania
and built a small office.

I was in a cornfield.

at Stanford,

27:43.205 --> 27:45.290
