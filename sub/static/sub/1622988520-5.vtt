WEBVTT

00:09.052 --> 00:11.533
-Patty, I can't live without you.
-Oh!

00:11.576 --> 00:13.622
Jenn, this is Allison.
Allison, my wife Jenn.

00:13.665 --> 00:16.059
Patty O'Connor? Detective
Tammy Ridgeway, Worcester PD.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.061
Do you have any idea
what that bust was about?

00:20.063 --> 00:23.501
Do you have any idea why this
car was reported stolen?

00:23.545 --> 00:25.068
Kevin, you called the police?!

00:25.112 --> 00:26.243
What was I s'posed to do?!

00:26.287 --> 00:27.679
I've been tryin' to reach ya
all day!

00:27.723 --> 00:29.551
That's the kind of juvenile crap
he does!

00:29.594 --> 00:31.422
And you just watched him
and laughed!

00:31.466 --> 00:32.945
I need those pills
for him.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.165
'Cause I'm gonna
kill Kevin.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.131
No, you're not.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.785
Yes, I am.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.440
Nah. You're just
having a time.

00:49.484 --> 00:52.400
Patty, I'm not "having a time."
I'm serious.

00:52.443 --> 00:56.447
I'm gonna kill him, and I'm
gonna make it look like an OD.

00:56.491 --> 01:00.147
Okay.

01:00.190 --> 01:04.151
What? That's -- That's not
exactly an insult.

01:04.194 --> 01:07.154
I mean, you're like --
you're you.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.243
You mean the person who just
saved your ass from two cops?

01:09.286 --> 01:12.463
Yeah, and it's not like you
shot 'em and we're on the lam.

01:12.507 --> 01:15.379
You asked nicely.

01:15.423 --> 01:19.166
Maybe you talk -- or think --
a big game, but come on.

01:19.209 --> 01:22.691
When it really comes down to it,
you're, like...

01:22.734 --> 01:24.345
wallpaper.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.219
In the nicest way
possible.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.009
Are you mad at me now?

01:37.053 --> 01:39.186
Yes.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.710
No. I just...

01:44.930 --> 01:46.541
You're right.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.501
I think I am
just having a time.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.403
Oh, shoot.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.666
Can you notice
this bruise?

02:24.709 --> 02:27.495
Oh, what? You mean where
the giant trucker fell on you?

02:27.538 --> 02:29.584
Yeah, it shows.

02:29.627 --> 02:30.889
Shoot.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.196
How am I gonna
explain this to Kevin?

02:33.240 --> 02:36.199
Allison, you think
I'm walking around wondering

02:36.243 --> 02:39.071
how I'm gonna explain a random
gun in the house to Neil?

02:39.115 --> 02:40.290
No.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.552
I'm gonna bury it
in the backyard

02:41.596 --> 02:43.424
so I don't have
to explain anything.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.689
Cover it up.

02:47.732 --> 02:50.692
Some criminal mastermind
you'd be.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.996
Allison?

03:34.039 --> 03:35.432
Jenn!

03:35.476 --> 03:36.477
Hey!
Hi!

03:36.520 --> 03:38.261
Hey, girl.
How are you?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.307
I'm fine. Fine.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.570
This place is great,
right?

03:42.613 --> 03:46.095
Totally.
I-I-I love it here.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.925
That foundation's
perfect for you.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.188
It's so good
for under-eye circles.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.975
Not that --
Not that you need it, of course.

03:57.019 --> 04:00.196
Thank you.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.068
Oh.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.247
Oh.
It was so good seeing you.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.770
Let's get coffee soon,
okay?

04:08.813 --> 04:11.076
Sure. Sure.
Okay. Bye.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.998
Hi.
Um...

04:20.042 --> 04:21.348
how much is this?

04:21.391 --> 04:22.914
$30.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.525
Are you serious?

04:24.568 --> 04:27.615
Yes.

04:27.658 --> 04:31.706
There's a CVS
down the street.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.664
No.
That's -- That's fine.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.840
Um, I will take this.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.886
Of course.
Please.

04:49.027 --> 04:53.118
Is there anything else
I can get you, ma'am?

04:53.162 --> 04:56.774
No. That's --
That's all for today...

04:56.818 --> 04:58.341
ma'am.

05:15.706 --> 05:16.881
Oh, come on.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.813
Hey, Kurt.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.512
Hi.

05:38.555 --> 05:41.950
You look...
perfect.

05:41.993 --> 05:46.084
Oh, yeah.
I feel radiant.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.913
Kurt, it's --
it's Tuesday.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.698
Uh-huh.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.439
Oh.
That's cold.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.092
Yeah.

05:54.136 --> 05:55.616
We don't usually hang out
on Tuesdays.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.139
No, I know.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.271
I just, uh, I thought
I'd make an exception.

05:59.315 --> 06:02.753
So we could talk.

06:02.797 --> 06:05.277
Okay.

06:05.321 --> 06:08.585
Maybe you got some thinking
done on the road?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.282
About us?

06:15.984 --> 06:19.335
You forgot.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.642
I proposed.

06:21.685 --> 06:25.080
And...
y-you forgot.

06:25.123 --> 06:28.126
No.
No, I did-- I didn't forget.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.259
I mean...

06:30.302 --> 06:31.782
I-I really --
I mean to think about it.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.611
I did think about it.
I just --

06:34.655 --> 06:36.265
The truth is,
I didn't know why

06:36.308 --> 06:37.701
you had to propose
in the first place.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.094
I mean, we've been doing this
for three years,

06:39.137 --> 06:40.835
and it's fine.

06:40.878 --> 06:41.966
It's fine?

06:42.010 --> 06:44.316
Yeah.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.884
It's good, you know?

06:46.928 --> 06:49.278
Nothing was wrong.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.845
I don't know why
we should mess it up.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.456
Because I don't want to
just stand still

06:53.500 --> 06:55.458
for the rest
of my life.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.417
Why not?
We both hate exercise.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.463
Patty.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.900
I'm not asking for
anything weird.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.598
What I want is normal.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.426
It's what normal people do.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.342
Normal people.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.564
So, I'm not normal because
I want to live my life

07:14.608 --> 07:16.044
the way that I want to?

07:16.087 --> 07:19.482
Look, if this is the way
you want things, then...

07:19.526 --> 07:22.529
yeah, I-I -- you know,
I can't do it anymore.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.533
If we're never gonna
get married...

07:30.580 --> 07:32.190
No.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.239
We're not.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.940
Then we're done.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.684
Fine.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.345
You know what?

07:56.388 --> 07:58.869
Have fun
rotting at Kevin's house.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.058
Well, this is cozy.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.757
Yeah.
It's a tight fit.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.280
Hey, well,
what's going on here?

08:18.323 --> 08:21.326
Ah.
The women of the hour are here.

08:21.370 --> 08:25.069
Allison, would you be a doll
and sit down for a second?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.117
Okay.

08:31.902 --> 08:32.860
What is this, Kevin?

08:32.903 --> 08:34.557
Oh, no big deal.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.863
Just got a question.

08:35.906 --> 08:39.867
Just one teeny tiny,
itsy bitsy question.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.738
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out

08:41.782 --> 08:44.262
what you two did
on your road trip?!

08:44.306 --> 08:46.526
I'm gonna make like
a border guard here

08:46.569 --> 08:50.486
and ask if there's anything
you'd like to declare.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.445
-No?
-No?

08:53.489 --> 08:57.537
And boom goes
the dynamite!

08:57.580 --> 08:59.800
I found this burger wrapper
from Top Dog

08:59.843 --> 09:01.453
laying on the back floor
of my car.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.673
You're mad that we left
a wrapper in your car?

09:03.717 --> 09:07.285
Kevin, we found a whole wheel of
cheese under one of the seats.

09:07.329 --> 09:10.332
Hey, that was aging.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.682
Oh, no.
This is not about the mess.

09:12.726 --> 09:16.381
This so-called "beauty expo"
that the two of you took

09:16.425 --> 09:19.559
my car to was located
in Brattleboro,

09:19.602 --> 09:22.039
yet the nearest
Top Dog burger franchise

09:22.083 --> 09:24.955
is located in Burlington.

09:24.999 --> 09:28.089
Well --So, what happened
then is that --

09:28.132 --> 09:29.656
by your own account --

09:29.699 --> 09:34.878
you both drove three full hours
out of your way

09:34.922 --> 09:38.186
to eat at Top Dog?

09:38.229 --> 09:41.668
And you didn't bring a burger
back for me?!

09:41.711 --> 09:43.931
Unforgivable!
Sacrilege!

09:43.974 --> 09:46.368
The evidence doesn't lie,
ladies!

09:46.411 --> 09:48.370
Oh! Kevin!

09:48.413 --> 09:51.112
The burger would have gotten
cold on the drive back.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.767
And that's why I have
a toaster oven, Patty!

09:53.810 --> 09:56.596
Wow. He --
He caught us.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.120
Yep. Picture of a toaster oven.
Lock us up.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.643
No.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.732
This is not
an "us" problem.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.953
You see, Allison doesn't know
squat about fast food,

10:05.996 --> 10:07.302
bless her heart.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.520
She's simple.

10:08.564 --> 10:09.739
She's narrow-minded.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.698
She's right here.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.525
She likes salad.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.571
-Boo.
-Boo.

10:15.615 --> 10:20.489
Allison would never pick up
a burger for anyone.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.796
But you?

10:22.839 --> 10:24.841
You shoulda known better.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.322
The group can't have that.

10:27.365 --> 10:32.066
So, Patty O'Connor,
you are hereby...

10:32.109 --> 10:34.808
excommunicated.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.071
What that means is that you are
no longer allowed in

10:37.114 --> 10:40.422
or sometimes near a church --I know what it means, Pete.

10:40.465 --> 10:44.295
Yeah, well, in this case,
it's the church of Kevin.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.167
This isn't easy
on any of us,

10:46.210 --> 10:48.691
but you're free now
to start a new gang.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.736
You can take Allison.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.085
Gee, thanks.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.478
Hey!
Sorry. Reflex.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.176
And we will
move on as well.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.874
This town is
flush with Pattys.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.485
It's a buyers' market
for Pattys.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.966
Happy shopping.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.315
I know
you love a bargain.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.752
You can tell by
Allison's wardrobe.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.928
-Hey!
-Sorry. Reflex.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.628
-I think that went great.
-I think so.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.934
Yeah.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.413
Hey.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.111
What?

11:17.154 --> 11:18.329
You okay?

11:18.373 --> 11:20.810
Yeah. I'm fine.
Whatever.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.421
You know he's gonna change
his mind in, like, two minutes.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.858
It's how he is.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.511
I-I don't want him
to change his mind.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.557
I don't care.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.299
Okay, well, you know
what would cheer you up?

11:31.342 --> 11:32.735
I said I don't care.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.737
Why don't we do something
stupid tonight?

11:34.781 --> 11:37.697
Why would we do something
if we knew it was stupid?

11:37.740 --> 11:40.743
Because sometimes,
stupid can be fun.

11:40.787 --> 11:44.747
We can, like, break into
the community pool

11:44.791 --> 11:48.011
and go swimming,
or we could go to the Seas

11:48.055 --> 11:50.492
and scam drinks
off married guys.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.454
I'm gonna go home and eat
a really big burrito.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.545
Have fun.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.089
Jesus Christ.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.830
Don't worry.
It's just me.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.876
Yeah, and who the hell are you?
How'd you get in here?

12:26.920 --> 12:29.705
I picked the lock
at the back.

12:29.749 --> 12:35.102
You know, this place
has been here forever.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.494
Business must be good.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.453
Yeah.
People always need haircuts.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.542
Oh, yeah.

12:40.585 --> 12:44.024
Aunt Cindy just loves
your haircuts.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.765
C-Cindy?

12:45.808 --> 12:46.853
Cindy is your --

12:46.896 --> 12:49.943
Aunt. Yeah.
Nice lady.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.727
Real bad pill problem,
though.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.687
I've been taking
some off her hands.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.386
I'm a family man.

12:58.429 --> 13:02.303
So,
if you think about it,

13:02.346 --> 13:05.219
you've kind of been selling
to the both of us.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.830
That's not
the deal we had.

13:07.874 --> 13:11.138
Um, what did you think
was happening?

13:11.181 --> 13:13.314
That my little old auntie

13:13.357 --> 13:15.055
was throwing back
two bottles a week?

13:15.098 --> 13:17.361
Come on.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.756
She's got knee issues.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.236
Yeah.

13:22.279 --> 13:25.021
There are plenty of people
with "issues" in this town,

13:25.065 --> 13:27.850
and you've been helping out
a lot of 'em.

13:27.894 --> 13:31.506
Half my friends
buy through you.

13:31.549 --> 13:34.639
That--
That's not possible.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.686
Hey, you didn't
ask questions

13:37.729 --> 13:40.254
when your ladies
started to put in bulk orders.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.560
I get that.
I do.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.824
Why complicate things?

13:44.867 --> 13:48.523
But if you're gonna dry up
the well all of a sudden,

13:48.566 --> 13:51.439
you gotta answer
to all your real customers.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.747
Ah.
Detective Ridgeway.

13:55.791 --> 13:56.879
Back again.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.707
I'm nothing
if not thorough.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.362
I think
we covered everything.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.277
Well, that's kind of
for me to say, right?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.539
We're still looking
for this dealer,

14:04.582 --> 14:06.584
and I heard some stuff
about this area.

14:06.628 --> 14:10.284
You know of any --
Nick Wyndorff.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.112
You keeping
your nose clean?

14:12.155 --> 14:15.158
You bet,
Detective Ridgeway.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.986
Just got a nice wash.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.600
Yeah. I don't really know
anything about that.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.472
Maybe it ended with
the guy at Fiore's.

14:24.515 --> 14:28.215
No. I think I have a pretty good
lead beyond that.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.739
Oh, good.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.262
Drugs are...

14:32.306 --> 14:33.785
bad.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.789
And what are you doing
next Friday?

14:37.833 --> 14:40.401
Well, I -- What?

14:40.444 --> 14:42.925
You should come to
a work thing with me.

14:42.969 --> 14:46.668
-A work thing?
-Yeah, it'll be, um, fun.

14:46.711 --> 14:49.105
We can hang out,
talk some more.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.762
Uh, sure. Yeah.
Def-- Def-- Yeah.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.590
Uh, that sounds good.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.940
Well, great.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.637
I'm sure I'll be
seeing you, Nick.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.517
Nick?

15:11.693 --> 15:13.434
Oh, my God.

15:17.046 --> 15:20.658
Hey, bartender.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.965
Another beer, please?

15:23.009 --> 15:25.228
God, it's like
I'm invisible.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.883
If only.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.667
You're like a bumper sticker,
Neil.

15:29.711 --> 15:32.801
You're the only one
who doesn't have to look at you.

15:32.844 --> 15:35.717
It's times like this
I just wish that Patty would --

15:35.760 --> 15:37.023
Uh, sorry.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.547
I meant to say
"She-Devil."

15:39.590 --> 15:41.984
She-Devil was a pain,
but she was useful, you know?

15:42.028 --> 15:44.421
-She was our enforcer.
-Please.

15:44.465 --> 15:48.512
She's like Dad's hips --
utterly replaceable.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.036
Hey, bartender.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.690
Let me get some more buffalo
sauce for my grilled cheese.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.171
Hold up.
What have we got here?

15:55.215 --> 15:56.825
My friend.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.958
You just ordered buffalo sauce
for your grilled cheese?

15:59.001 --> 16:00.742
I was unaware that was
on the menu.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.178
It's not.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.050
But I don't order
from the menu.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.182
Not in here.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.445
Not in life.

16:08.489 --> 16:11.796
Whoa,
I think that's deep.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.015
What do you call
that little baby?

16:13.059 --> 16:15.061
I call it a Paddy Melt.

16:15.104 --> 16:20.327
My name's Patrick,
but everybody calls me "Paddy."

16:20.370 --> 16:22.677
Paddy Melt.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.287
Patty...
Paddy.

16:24.331 --> 16:25.854
Patty, Paddy.
-Come on.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.291
Kevin taketh and
the Good Lord giveth.

16:28.335 --> 16:31.120
Sir, why don't you
come join us here?

16:31.164 --> 16:32.513
Alright.

16:32.556 --> 16:36.604
Hey, bartender, food, there.

16:36.647 --> 16:39.781
He's very commanding.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.740
I like the cut of your jib,
Paddy.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.873
Thank you very much,
Kevin.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.396
Did he just
guess my name?

16:48.964 --> 16:52.272
Thank you.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.838
Look, I get it,
you're cold.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.492
Well, that's what happens
when it's 20 degrees

16:55.536 --> 16:57.494
and the heat
is still broken.

16:57.538 --> 16:59.366
Yeah, well, I thought
I could get away

16:59.409 --> 17:02.064
with waiting to fix the furnace
for another week or so.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.283
It's been warm.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.633
Yeah, well, you say that
every year.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.679
Ah.
Cold does you good.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.159
Keeps you awake.

17:12.640 --> 17:16.078
Did I tell you Chuck's been
falling asleep at stop lights?

17:16.122 --> 17:17.601
Yeah.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.386
Hey.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.741
What are you doing?

17:26.784 --> 17:28.656
Context clues, Allison.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.273
God, I hate vodka.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.970
Well, you got a-a whole
liquor store in here.

17:39.014 --> 17:42.148
It's efficient.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.975
You still
excommunicated?

17:44.019 --> 17:45.542
What?

17:45.586 --> 17:48.676
No.
I mean, yes.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.982
It's not about that.

17:51.026 --> 17:54.247
Okay.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.989
It's just all this shit,
you know?

17:58.033 --> 17:59.991
Why can't we all agree
that change sucks

18:00.035 --> 18:01.384
and everything
should stay the same?

18:01.428 --> 18:03.038
Well, that's a --
that's a losing battle.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.867
You can't put that toothpaste
back in the tube.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.260
Sure you can.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.784
Use a Q-tip.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.525
You know what I mean.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.139
Day Drinking Barbie.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.054
Love it.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.665
Well, watching you work's
making me thirsty, so...

18:25.713 --> 18:28.019
Excuse me.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.370
Hey.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.154
I said "excuse me."

18:32.198 --> 18:33.677
Okay, sorry.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.592
When you bump into someone,
you should acknowledge it

18:35.636 --> 18:37.986
and, I don't know,
maybe apologize.

18:38.029 --> 18:42.121
Yeah, uh, I just said
I'm sorry, okay?

18:42.164 --> 18:44.427
Uppity bitch.

18:44.471 --> 18:47.038
What did you just call me,
you piece of shit?

18:47.082 --> 18:48.736
You said "shit."
I'm so proud of you.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.520
All I'm asking for
is some decency.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.305
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.655
I am so sorry, sir.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.136
Uh --
It's on the house.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.311
What?

19:02.097 --> 19:04.752
D, that man just bashed into me
and called me a bitch.

19:04.795 --> 19:08.321
Yeah, and I am sorry,
but hello?

19:08.364 --> 19:10.105
Is it your first day here?

19:10.149 --> 19:12.325
Last week,
I got spit on.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.065
Come on.
You know the drill.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.198
We gotta put up
with this crap daily.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.203
You're right, D.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.683
Yeah.
I know.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.859
We do.

19:28.993 --> 19:32.606
What's this? You just said
you were -- you were cold.

19:32.649 --> 19:35.826
Oh, oh, oh.
No.

19:35.870 --> 19:39.221
Um...

19:39.265 --> 19:41.223
I quit.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.007
What?

19:43.051 --> 19:46.315
Uh, Allison, you don't have
to be so dramatic.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.798
Bye, Diane.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.408
Consider this
my gold watch.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.812
Sam,
I need to talk to you.

20:04.855 --> 20:05.856
Now.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.380
Okay.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.228
I'm not wallpaper.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.629
Evening.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.805
Jesus Christ.

20:41.849 --> 20:46.332
Never got to finish our
conversation from earlier, so...

20:46.375 --> 20:47.637
thought I'd stop by.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.465
I don't know what else
we have to talk about.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.380
Oh.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.164
The pills you owe me,
for one.

20:53.208 --> 20:56.037
The town is dry.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.691
It's not my fault.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.087
Oh.

21:03.131 --> 21:06.874
I feel like you must not
have heard of me

21:06.917 --> 21:10.312
if you're taking
that sorta tone.

21:10.356 --> 21:13.489
No, I-I've heard of you.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.752
Good.

21:18.015 --> 21:20.627
Your friend Tammy stopped
by my house today.

21:20.670 --> 21:24.065
Right after I saw her
at your salon.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.675
I-I didn't do that.

21:25.719 --> 21:26.720
Sure.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.069
Fine.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.549
But...

21:29.592 --> 21:32.987
she was asking questions
about a local drug dealer,

21:33.030 --> 21:37.252
someone who maybe sold
before the town...

21:37.296 --> 21:40.647
went dry.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.301
Sounds familiar.

21:45.173 --> 21:48.132
So, if you want your friend
Tammy to think that your salon

21:48.176 --> 21:51.571
actually specializes
in a good wash,

21:51.614 --> 21:53.224
give me some pills,
honey.

22:06.455 --> 22:09.415
The way you got up in that
Yankee fan's dumb face?

22:09.458 --> 22:10.720
You scared him outta the bar

22:10.764 --> 22:11.982
without even saying
a single word.

22:12.026 --> 22:15.029
You just stared at him.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.944
And pulled out
a big-ass knife.

22:16.987 --> 22:19.860
This is exciting. We've never
had a real badass in our crew.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.340
Badass is fresh.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.386
I've been badass for years.
It's nothing new.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.436
Alright.
Got an intruder.

22:30.479 --> 22:33.308
Female, 5'7", brown hair,

22:33.352 --> 22:35.441
about 55 to 60
years of age.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.660
That sounds like Patty.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.706
I'm 33 and look it!

22:39.749 --> 22:42.186
Let me in!

22:42.230 --> 22:43.666
Can't allow it.

22:43.710 --> 22:46.190
Patty violated my trust,
and the price must be paid.

22:46.234 --> 22:49.280
"You are the weakest link!
Goodbye!"

22:49.324 --> 22:50.543
You remember that show?

22:50.586 --> 22:52.632
It was wicked cool.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.895
Alright,
Kevin has spoken.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.114
Nobody gets into
this house.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.815
Come on, Kevin!

23:01.858 --> 23:04.644
Let me in!

23:04.687 --> 23:06.472
I have Allison's coat.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.347
And a tallboy.

23:14.784 --> 23:17.439
See?
Not a trick.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.398
Or a treat,
that's for sure.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.703
Kev,
you just say the word

23:20.747 --> 23:24.185
and I'll booby-trap this place
soup to nuts.

23:24.228 --> 23:26.274
You're soup to nuts.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.581
You don't need to
booby-trap anything.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.539
Paddy,
will you please tell Patty

23:30.583 --> 23:32.933
that if Patty has something to
say, Patty can say it to Paddy

23:32.976 --> 23:34.630
and Paddy will tell me
what Patty said?

23:36.850 --> 23:40.593
Uh, I think that means
get outta here.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.029
Whatever!

23:42.072 --> 23:43.422
I'll wait in the kitchen
for Allison.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.075
That way, you won't even
have to look at me.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.816
Yeah, except we already
looked at ya.

23:46.860 --> 23:50.341
-What was that, Neil?
-Nothing.
I was talking about Kevin.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.557
Wow. That's nice.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.385
I'm sorry.
I just -- It's complicated.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.736
Okay, well, maybe it doesn't
have to be, you know?

24:36.779 --> 24:40.043
Everything's complicated
if you overthink it.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.959
So, maybe instead of going
just straight to guilt,

24:43.003 --> 24:47.007
you could enjoy
being stupid for once.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.399
Impulsive.

24:48.443 --> 24:51.011
You're giving me lessons
on being impulsive?

24:51.054 --> 24:55.232
Oh, I am totally
unpredictable lately.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.408
I, um...

24:57.452 --> 24:59.802
I quit
the package store today.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.543
You did?
Yeah.

25:01.587 --> 25:05.286
I just -- I threw down my smock
and I walked out of there.

25:05.329 --> 25:06.548
Wow.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.898
You've been there
for, what, 10 years?

25:08.942 --> 25:11.205
16.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.294
I just felt like if I was in
that place for one more second,

25:13.337 --> 25:15.426
I'd literally die.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.864
I'd keel over next
to the rack of Malibu.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.822
On sale for $23.99.

25:19.866 --> 25:22.303
What are you gonna do
instead?

25:22.346 --> 25:24.958
Uh, I don't know.

25:25.001 --> 25:26.699
Anything.

25:26.742 --> 25:27.874
That's exciting.

25:27.917 --> 25:30.441
Very impulsive.
Yeah.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.356
And obviously, that job
wasn't going anywhere,

25:32.400 --> 25:37.057
and I feel like I need
to keep going, you know?

25:37.100 --> 25:39.276
Although they did pay me.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.279
But it was
terrible money.

25:43.716 --> 25:46.457
But it was still money.

25:46.501 --> 25:47.763
It was still steady money.

25:47.807 --> 25:48.808
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

25:48.851 --> 25:50.200
There's the Allison I know.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.593
No, I'm serious.
What am I gonna do?

25:51.637 --> 25:54.074
-It'll be fine.
-No, I can't have no money.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.380
What am I -- I'm gonna rely
on my husband for an allowance?

25:56.424 --> 25:59.166
-Jesus Christ.
-Hey, listen, um...

25:59.209 --> 26:00.863
I've been hurting
for reliable employees

26:00.907 --> 26:03.910
since I opened this place,
and I know you can drop a tray

26:03.953 --> 26:05.781
full of water glasses
with the best of them.

26:05.825 --> 26:09.480
-I've seen it.
-That was one time.

26:09.524 --> 26:12.222
Well?

26:12.266 --> 26:13.920
Are you --
Are you serious?

26:13.963 --> 26:17.532
You're offering me a job
right now?

26:17.576 --> 26:19.186
Uh, yeah.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.101
Yeah, it didn't really seem
problematic until just now,

26:21.144 --> 26:25.192
but I just wanted
to impulsively offer a hand.

26:46.822 --> 26:49.259
I know what you did.

26:49.303 --> 26:50.826
What?

26:50.870 --> 26:53.394
The seat, please.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.661
Interrogate her like
I taught you, Kev.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.708
Where are we even gonna find
40 strobe lights?

27:02.751 --> 27:04.405
In my van.

27:06.407 --> 27:09.149
Where were you tonight,
Allison?

27:09.192 --> 27:10.629
At work.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.761
Doing what?

27:12.805 --> 27:14.676
Working?

27:16.591 --> 27:20.508
Do you take me for some
kind of an idiot, Allison?

27:20.551 --> 27:22.728
Did you really think
I would have no idea

27:22.771 --> 27:24.686
what's going on
with my own wife?

27:24.730 --> 27:26.514
This is a small town.

27:26.557 --> 27:29.430
It was only a matter of time
until I found out...

27:31.650 --> 27:36.698
that you quit
the liquor store?!

27:36.742 --> 27:39.658
The liquor store?
Yeah!
The liquor store!

27:39.701 --> 27:42.182
Diane just called
and told me what happened.

27:42.225 --> 27:45.054
Now, if you'll look at this
board, you'll see see all the --

27:45.098 --> 27:46.708
Eh, you got
the wrong side there.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.188
That's the one you used
from earlier.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.146
Just flip it around,
Kevin.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.366
Flip it, Kev.
There you go. Nice flip.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.629
Thanks, Paddy.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.935
Because of
your actions,

27:55.978 --> 27:59.503
we just lost your 10% discount
on alcohol.

27:59.547 --> 28:02.724
So, I took the liberty of
laying out the math for ya.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.118
Uh...
this is math?

28:05.161 --> 28:08.512
Look at the board and you'll see
all of the things that,

28:08.556 --> 28:11.951
because of your little tantrum,
we can longer afford.

28:11.994 --> 28:14.388
I love when Kev goes full
"Murder, She Wrote."

28:14.431 --> 28:16.738
We do have similar hair.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.392
Kevin,
I already got a new job.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.655
Is it at
another liquor store?

28:20.699 --> 28:23.223
No. A diner.
Gah!

28:23.266 --> 28:28.445
Allison, this all comes back
to one basic concept --

28:28.489 --> 28:29.925
loyalty.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.797
I demand it.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.321
Our marriage demands it.

28:34.364 --> 28:38.542
Kev, you deserve not to have
to think about this stuff.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.981
You know what would
make you feel better?

28:42.024 --> 28:44.418
The doctors say
a quadruple bypass.

28:44.461 --> 28:48.161
A relaxing dudes' day
of competitive paintball.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.467
Sir,
we'd love nothing more.

28:50.511 --> 28:51.860
Hell yeah.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.079
I'm out.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.689
But, Dad, you love
war simulations.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.995
Yeah, you always
get so into them.

28:56.038 --> 28:59.215
Those are called
flashbacks.

28:59.259 --> 29:03.132
I'm gonna sit this one out,
catch up on my Bible reading.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.786
You wanna read a real Bible,

29:04.830 --> 29:07.223
might wanna check out
"The Da Vinci Code."

29:10.574 --> 29:12.881
Hey.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.317
No one mentioned
you were in here.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.189
They probably forgot.

29:16.232 --> 29:18.844
You waiting for me?

29:18.887 --> 29:22.108
What the hell are these,
Allison?

29:22.151 --> 29:23.500
What?
You went through my pockets?

29:23.544 --> 29:25.851
So not the point.

29:25.894 --> 29:30.812
I got them from the trucker
in Vermont.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.248
The one
you pistol whipped.

29:32.292 --> 29:35.034
Okay.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.645
You carried them around.

29:37.688 --> 29:39.821
You're actually thinking
about doing this.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.431
I already told you
that I was.

29:41.475 --> 29:44.086
It's not my fault
you don't listen.
Excuse me.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.784
You're the woman
who won't speak up

29:45.827 --> 29:48.003
when she doesn't get a slice
of her own birthday cake.

29:48.047 --> 29:51.224
You can't blame me for having
some doubts that you're going...

29:54.705 --> 29:57.143
You know I'm dry,

29:57.186 --> 29:59.362
and it's --
it's created more problems.

29:59.406 --> 30:02.801
Like, murder-y guys guys coming
around my place, threatening me.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.981
Why don't you just
give me these, okay?

30:09.024 --> 30:11.331
Can't.
No, Allison.

30:11.374 --> 30:13.072
You can't do this.

30:14.987 --> 30:18.207
The thing is,
I think I can.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.775
Turns out,
I'm actually good at...

30:20.819 --> 30:22.037
doing terrible things
to people

30:22.081 --> 30:23.473
who deserve
what's coming to them.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.388
It's not that hard.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.869
It's just like giving karma
a little push.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.262
And no one deserves
what's coming to them

30:29.305 --> 30:33.832
more than that asshole
in the living room.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.442
And I got the pills,
and all I gotta do

30:35.485 --> 30:38.140
is just spike
the next disgusting meal

30:38.184 --> 30:40.882
he makes me make for him,
and just --

30:40.926 --> 30:45.582
just watch his breathing
slow down until it stops.

30:45.626 --> 30:47.280
And then I'm free,
Patty.

30:50.283 --> 30:55.462
Okay.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.986
Maybe that's true.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.553
Maybe you could
go through with it.

30:59.596 --> 31:00.684
I'm telling you, I can.

31:00.728 --> 31:02.643
Okay, you can go through
with it.

31:02.686 --> 31:04.688
But are you really sure
that it'll work?

31:06.995 --> 31:09.737
Because you better be.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.043
You better know
beyond a doubt

31:11.086 --> 31:12.348
that he's not gonna
wake up the next day

31:12.392 --> 31:14.307
wondering why the hell
he passed out

31:14.350 --> 31:17.788
and pissed himself after eating
what you fed him.

31:17.832 --> 31:18.964
Well...

31:19.007 --> 31:20.791
that should be enough.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.141
Should?

31:22.184 --> 31:25.144
Allison, this is Kevin
we're talking about.

31:25.187 --> 31:27.015
The guy who drank a pint
of moonshine on Christmas Eve,

31:27.059 --> 31:28.843
then woke up for kegs and eggs
on Christmas Day.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.933
He's a tank.

31:31.977 --> 31:35.937
This whole thing --
this plan -- it's dangerous.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.333
And not just for you.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.164
Hear me out for a sec.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.993
Kevin's got a very public grudge
against me right now.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.646
That's motive.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.475
I got the cops coming in and out
of the salon every other day

31:52.519 --> 31:55.174
asking about the "local dealer"
who's been selling --

31:55.217 --> 31:58.568
who's been selling
Oxys to the town.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.092
Maybe you don't
give a shit.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.267
Maybe you don't have
a conscience

32:01.310 --> 32:03.965
when it comes
to Kevin anymore.

32:04.009 --> 32:07.142
But try and have one
when it comes to me.

32:10.363 --> 32:14.671
Please.

32:20.721 --> 32:23.419
It's gonna be fine.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.639
Okay?

32:25.682 --> 32:27.249
It's all gonna be fine.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.694
Oh, God.

32:47.966 --> 32:48.967
Kurt?

32:53.014 --> 32:56.017
Hey!
Patty.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.584
Kurt, hi.
What are you doing?

32:57.627 --> 33:00.456
-I need to talk to you.
-Okay?

33:00.500 --> 33:03.111
I know I was being
real stupid earlier,

33:03.155 --> 33:05.766
letting this end.

33:05.809 --> 33:09.813
I was just scared,
you know?

33:09.857 --> 33:13.034
I mean, you're --
you're the best.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.906
Solid, steady.

33:15.950 --> 33:18.387
That's what I want.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.041
Forever.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.914
So, let's do this.

33:23.958 --> 33:27.048
Let's get married.

33:27.092 --> 33:29.877
I made a huge mistake.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.880
I don't think you did.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.273
What are you talking about?
I-I --

33:34.316 --> 33:36.144
Kevin called me.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.189
Kevin?

33:37.232 --> 33:38.973
Yeah.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.715
He, uh, wanted me to know
"the kind of lady I was with."

33:41.758 --> 33:44.109
Said you couldn't
be trusted,

33:44.152 --> 33:46.241
and that you went
behind his back and --

33:46.285 --> 33:51.159
Oh, my God.
Kurt, he's a Goddamn idiot.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.814
I mean, he's just mad that
I didn't bring him a burger back

33:53.857 --> 33:55.207
from when Allison
and I went on our trip.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.469
It's nothing.

33:56.512 --> 33:57.818
Yeah, I-I know
what it was about.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.211
He told me.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.777
And I know
he's an idiot.

34:00.821 --> 34:03.041
I mean, I've been telling you
that for years.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.217
But...

34:05.260 --> 34:07.219
when he was telling me
what happened,

34:07.262 --> 34:12.572
I realized you obviously
never went to a beauty expo.

34:12.615 --> 34:15.227
I Googled it, and there aren't
even any beauty expos

34:15.270 --> 34:16.924
in Vermont.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.187
And I guess I really don't care
where you actually went.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.016
Maybe it has something to do
with the cop that was stopping

34:22.060 --> 34:24.540
by the pharmacy,
asking questions about you.

34:24.584 --> 34:27.369
I have no idea.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.762
But that's the thing
that got me.

34:28.805 --> 34:31.895
I have no idea.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.419
Not where you were,

34:33.462 --> 34:35.247
not what you might be doing
with Allison.

34:35.290 --> 34:38.511
Like, none.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.295
We've been sitting
next to each other

34:40.339 --> 34:43.777
for the last three years,

34:43.820 --> 34:46.823
and, uh, I don't think
I know you at all.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.653
So, just...

35:07.757 --> 35:10.978
Frickin' Revelations.

35:11.021 --> 35:15.809
So, how did playing paintball
go with Travis Bickle?

35:15.852 --> 35:18.420
First of all,
the "paintball course"

35:18.464 --> 35:21.031
was the parking lot
of a Walmart.

35:21.075 --> 35:24.296
Paddy would just shoot anyone
who didn't put their cart away.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.559
Yeah, and he shot me whenever
his little heart desired,

35:26.602 --> 35:29.649
which it desired a lot.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.173
That's a "P," man.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.262
He basically branded me.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.046
He's a psycho.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.526
With excellent aim.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.094
Alright, who's gonna
tell this unhinged marksman

35:40.138 --> 35:41.748
to hit the bricks?

35:44.229 --> 35:47.536
We're in a bit
of a jam here.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.581
No! No!

35:55.240 --> 35:58.112
And remember, it has to be
a real smash burger.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.983
Chili,
extra cheese.

36:00.027 --> 36:02.203
And none of your fancy cheese,
okay?

36:02.247 --> 36:04.118
Just terrible
yellow American.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.946
I know how to
make a burger, thank you.

36:05.989 --> 36:07.556
Okay.

36:11.691 --> 36:12.996
You ready to start
the new chapter

36:13.040 --> 36:14.737
of your career
next week?

36:14.781 --> 36:16.739
The Bev's Diner
Chapter?

36:16.783 --> 36:19.655
Absolutely.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.744
Expect my whole life
to change.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.923
Uh, is that burning, Sam?

36:26.967 --> 36:28.838
Oh, shit.

36:28.882 --> 36:31.319
Ah.

36:31.363 --> 36:34.931
So, why do you have me
re-creating a Top Dog burger?

37:21.326 --> 37:23.328
Look, Kev.

37:23.371 --> 37:26.331
Is that
a Top Dog burger?

37:26.374 --> 37:28.724
-Where'd you get that?
-Oh, I'm not sure.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.944
Someone left it on
the back stoop with a note

37:30.987 --> 37:34.121
that just said
"I'm sorry."

37:34.164 --> 37:35.992
Who could it have been?

37:36.036 --> 37:37.516
Let me think
this through.

37:37.559 --> 37:39.822
Who in my life needs
to apologize to me?

37:39.866 --> 37:41.563
-Probably Patty.
-Yeah, it's gotta be Patty.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.522
Um, Patty does make
the most sense.

37:43.565 --> 37:46.873
No, no, no.
Paddy's right here.

37:46.916 --> 37:50.398
Alright, this sounds insane,
but hear me out.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.095
I bet it's Patty.

37:53.488 --> 37:55.273
Solid work, Kev.

37:55.316 --> 37:58.667
So, Patty drove
all the way back to Top Dog

37:58.711 --> 38:00.800
just to make up
for her act of betrayal?

38:00.843 --> 38:02.410
Noble.

38:02.454 --> 38:05.021
Hey, there, little buddy.
In a matter of moments,

38:05.065 --> 38:08.721
you're about to go from
outside me to inside me.

38:11.898 --> 38:14.204
You step back,
She-Devil!

38:14.248 --> 38:16.163
You are banned
from the premises!

38:16.206 --> 38:18.774
Bro,
you gotta calm down.

38:18.818 --> 38:19.949
You're way too intense.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.648
Too intense?
What, are you kidding me?

38:22.691 --> 38:28.784
My intensity is what makes me
an ideal upgrade from you!

38:28.828 --> 38:30.873
Ain't that right,
my guys?

38:32.919 --> 38:34.399
Clearly, they agree with me.

38:34.442 --> 38:37.097
Oh, yeah, right. And they're
just too nice to tell me?

38:37.140 --> 38:39.317
Absolutely not.
They're too scared.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.493
Scared?

38:44.191 --> 38:46.367
Kev, that's not
how you feel, is it?

38:46.411 --> 38:50.632
I try not to start
any statements with "I feel."

38:50.676 --> 38:52.155
It's too soft.

38:52.199 --> 38:55.637
Paddy,
you're terrifying.

38:55.681 --> 38:59.467
I'm very afraid of you,
and I'm huge.

38:59.511 --> 39:02.949
Sorry.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.820
No.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.388
No, I'm sorry,
alright?

39:07.432 --> 39:09.651
I never wanted to make anybody
feel uncomfortable.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.436
I think I should leave.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.089
It's probably
for the best.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.964
Hey.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.840
Paddy, wait --No, no, no.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.538
My parole's
getting revoked anyway

39:26.581 --> 39:28.714
'cause of what I did
to that mannequin, so...

39:28.757 --> 39:32.108
What'd you do
to that mannequin?

39:32.152 --> 39:34.415
You're sweet.

39:34.459 --> 39:38.854
Well, guess I'll see y'all in
around five to seven years!

39:42.162 --> 39:43.555
That was amazing.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.295
You stood up to him
like nobody else.

39:45.339 --> 39:47.733
Yeah, you really
saved our necks there.

39:47.776 --> 39:49.169
Too bad this didn't happen
yesterday.

39:49.212 --> 39:52.433
You could have really
saved Neil's neck.

39:52.477 --> 39:53.434
Oh.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.783
It's very purple.

39:54.827 --> 39:56.219
Which is a good thing.

39:56.263 --> 39:59.222
It means the bruise
is getting air.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.442
I'm impressed.

40:01.486 --> 40:05.272
You really showed
you've got what it takes.

40:05.315 --> 40:07.187
I like the cut...

40:07.230 --> 40:09.711
of your jib.

40:09.755 --> 40:11.583
Thanks.

40:11.626 --> 40:13.759
Welcome back to the group.

40:13.802 --> 40:15.630
And thanks for the burger.

40:15.674 --> 40:16.631
What burger?

40:16.675 --> 40:18.111
Okay.
I get it.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.156
You don't know anything
about the Top Dog burger

40:20.200 --> 40:23.856
that just happened to be on
my stoop with an apology note.

40:23.899 --> 40:26.380
Alright. This is gonna happen
in two bites.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.034
You ready?

40:34.170 --> 40:35.563
Maybe it would've worked,
but --

40:35.607 --> 40:36.956
Maybe.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.392
Yeah, maybe isn't good enough,
I guess.

40:38.436 --> 40:42.962
So, just take 'em
if you think it'll help.

40:43.005 --> 40:45.007
Half the problem,
for sure.

40:45.051 --> 40:46.487
Though I don't think it does me
any favors

40:46.531 --> 40:48.010
with Detective Ridgeway.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.798
Thanks, though.

40:52.841 --> 40:54.408
Don't think this is me
changing my mind, though,

40:54.452 --> 40:56.062
'cause I-I can't.

40:58.978 --> 41:00.893
Okay.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.634
I get it.

41:02.677 --> 41:06.115
He's a manipulative dick.

41:06.159 --> 41:08.378
Once you see it, you can't
un-see it, you know?

41:08.422 --> 41:09.989
Yep.

41:10.032 --> 41:13.383
But you do realize that
we got pulled over together

41:13.427 --> 41:15.211
out of state.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.909
We assaulted a trucker
together.

41:19.172 --> 41:22.784
You made me an accomplice
without telling me.

41:22.828 --> 41:26.484
If you get caught,
I go down, too.

41:26.527 --> 41:29.138
I'll end up rotting away
in prison

41:29.182 --> 41:32.533
because you roped me
into this mess.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.535
Or because you're
an evil drug dealer.

41:37.277 --> 41:38.583
That was a joke.

41:38.626 --> 41:41.977
No. Shut up.

41:42.021 --> 41:47.635
Okay.

41:47.679 --> 41:51.683
Detective Ridgeway is looking
for the local dealer.

41:51.726 --> 41:52.858
Yeah. You.

41:52.901 --> 41:56.426
So, maybe...

41:56.470 --> 41:59.865
we give her
somebody different.

41:59.908 --> 42:01.606
If Kevin...

42:01.649 --> 42:04.086
is going to die.

42:04.130 --> 42:05.697
Yes.

42:05.740 --> 42:08.047
Okay.

42:08.090 --> 42:13.443
So, maybe instead of
in some quiet, small way,

42:13.487 --> 42:16.098
it's big and violent
and surrounded

42:16.142 --> 42:20.712
by certain
drug-dealing stuff --

42:20.755 --> 42:22.931
who's to say he wasn't
selling to the town?

42:25.412 --> 42:26.935
That's an idea.

42:29.242 --> 42:31.723
That's a good idea.

42:31.766 --> 42:33.594
You think I can pull off
big and violent?

42:33.638 --> 42:36.728
No.
Allison, look at your coat.

42:36.771 --> 42:38.947
We'd obviously need
to outsource.

42:38.991 --> 42:41.733
Okay.

42:41.776 --> 42:44.344
Well, um...

42:44.387 --> 42:46.215
you know any
natural-born killers?

42:50.655 --> 42:53.309
I think I might.

42:58.488 --> 43:01.143
Feel like my body's been tense
for years and I'm finally

43:01.187 --> 43:03.363
just...relaxed.

43:05.191 --> 43:06.801
I thought we weren't
gonna do this anymore.

43:06.845 --> 43:08.890
What kind of timeline
are we lookin' at?

43:08.934 --> 43:12.938
-Soon.
-I thought that was you!

43:12.981 --> 43:14.983
-What the hell is happening?!
-Now you're all shocked

43:15.027 --> 43:17.595
that it's a little bit messy --
well, guess what, Allison,

43:17.638 --> 43:19.074
you're beggin' for it!
