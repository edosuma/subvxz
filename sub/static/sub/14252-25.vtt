WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.197
Show mercy.

00:04.270 --> 00:05.931
Your people have a saying:

00:06.006 --> 00:07.939
''Fool me once, shame on you.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.942
Fool me twice, shame on me.''

00:10.010 --> 00:11.943
ln other words,
your credit's no good here.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.104
l'll pay you back double

00:13.179 --> 00:14.771
with next month's
replicator rations.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.839
That's what you said
when l let you replicate

00:16.916 --> 00:19.316
all those pork rinds
for your monster movie marathon.

00:19.386 --> 00:20.944
Let me put it another way.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.285
This is a life-and-death
situation!

00:23.356 --> 00:24.323
Hyperbole won't help.

00:24.391 --> 00:25.449
l'm not exaggerating.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.493
This is the anniversary
of my first date

00:27.560 --> 00:28.788
with B'Elanna.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.626
And you forgot all about it?

00:31.698 --> 00:33.131
Yes, and if l
don't come through

00:33.199 --> 00:34.826
with some kind
of romantic dinner...

00:34.901 --> 00:36.960
All right,
you've made your case.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.435
Neelix, you're a saint.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.133
Okay, that'll be one bottle
of Mouton Rothschild--

00:41.207 --> 00:44.176
a 2342 if it's in the database--

00:44.244 --> 00:46.576
Uh, Terellian pheasant,
steamed asparagus

00:46.646 --> 00:47.578
and a single rose.

00:47.647 --> 00:48.579
Where do you want it?

00:48.648 --> 00:49.637
You can send the food

00:49.716 --> 00:51.581
requisition
to B'Elanna's replicator.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.119
The wine and the flower
l'll take with me.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.950
Well, l can't show up
empty-handed.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.990
Neelix,
how about a pot of coffee

00:58.058 --> 00:58.990
while you're at it?

00:59.092 --> 01:00.150
Coming right up.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.919
Flowers and wine?

01:02.996 --> 01:04.327
Ah, anniversary.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.421
-Oh.
-Coffee?

01:05.498 --> 01:06.590
Bridge duty.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.293
l've got eight hours
ahead of me.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.359
Sitting in the big chair again?

01:10.437 --> 01:11.927
Fourth night in a row.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.367
You're not fooling anyone.

01:14.441 --> 01:15.373
Excuse me?

01:15.442 --> 01:16.932
You love these night shifts.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.704
Your chance to play Captain?

01:18.778 --> 01:20.143
l'm not playing.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.306
This is an opportunity
to get command experience.

01:22.382 --> 01:23.815
You might put in
for some yourself.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.942
Oh, what's the point
of trying to compete

01:26.019 --> 01:27.782
with an ambitious
upstart like you?

01:27.854 --> 01:30.448
Just promise me one thing:
When you reach the top,

01:30.523 --> 01:32.286
you'll remember
all the little people

01:32.358 --> 01:33.950
you climbed over to get there

01:34.027 --> 01:36.655
and you won't make them
work night shifts.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.139 --> 01:47.970
Helm, status?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.542
Same as it was 20 minutes ago.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.237
Refresh my memory.

01:52.312 --> 01:56.976
Current speed-- warp 6.3,
heading 021 mark 2.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.977
Permission to speak freely, sir?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.349
Granted.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.253
We're on the night shift.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.518
Relax.

02:05.592 --> 02:06.786
One of these days,

02:06.860 --> 02:08.919
you'll get the call
to take the Bridge,

02:08.995 --> 02:10.257
and maybe then

02:10.330 --> 02:12.423
you'll understand
the burden of command.

02:13.933 --> 02:14.900
Report.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.333
lt's an automated distress call.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.767
Origin?

02:17.837 --> 02:20.067
A Class-M planet.
Range-- .73 light-years,

02:20.140 --> 02:23.075
bearing 261 mark 15.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.873
That would be
a significant course change.

02:25.945 --> 02:28.880
Burden of command is
on your shoulders, sir.

02:28.948 --> 02:32.281
Of course, we could always
wake Commander Chakotay.

02:32.352 --> 02:33.842
No.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.285
Alter course.

02:48.201 --> 02:50.294
Open a channel.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.395
This is Ensign Kim
of the Starship Voyager.

02:52.472 --> 02:53.666
Can we be of assistance?

02:55.041 --> 02:56.838
l'm not picking up
on any life signs.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.606
l guess they didn't make it.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.374
There could be
any number of reasons

03:01.447 --> 03:03.108
why we're not detecting
life signs.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.242
We'll have to go down there
and take a look.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.842
l'll inform the Commander.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.822
Oh, Jenkins,
the Bridge is yours.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.052
l hope l made
the right decision.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.926
About changing course
or waking me up?

03:17.997 --> 03:19.430
Sorry, sir,
but l thought...

03:19.499 --> 03:20.761
Relax, Harry,
you did the right thing

03:20.833 --> 03:21.765
on both counts.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.096
Thanks.

03:23.169 --> 03:24.761
Hey, why don't you
lead the away team?

03:24.837 --> 03:26.566
l'll monitor your
progress from the Bridge.

03:26.639 --> 03:27.765
Yes, sir.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.209
The distress call was automated?

03:31.277 --> 03:32.539
That's right.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.409
l'm hoping whoever
sent it is still alive.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.606
Who's leading the mission?

03:35.682 --> 03:36.774
You're looking at him.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.077
-Really?
-Problem?

03:38.151 --> 03:40.676
No. l just thought,
given the circumstances--

03:40.753 --> 03:42.414
a new planet, unknown hazards--

03:42.488 --> 03:45.423
that Commander Chakotay
or Tuvok would be in charge.

03:45.491 --> 03:46.958
l am a senior officer, Doc.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.960
l've been on this ship
for five years.

03:49.028 --> 03:50.825
l think l can handle
an away mission.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.888
l certainly didn't mean
any offense.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.126
None taken.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.897
Of course, having me on the team
will more than compensate

03:57.971 --> 04:00.838
for any lack of experience
on your part.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.340
Energize.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.514
Are you sure these are
the right coordinates?

04:14.587 --> 04:15.849
Positive.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.517
Apparently, whoever sent
the distress call was rescued.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.719
Maybe, but as long
as we're here,

04:21.793 --> 04:23.523
we should make
a thorough search.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.688
Spread out.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.896
Ensign?

04:39.846 --> 04:42.337
This is the source
of the distress call.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.746
What is it?

04:43.816 --> 04:44.942
l don't know.

04:47.020 --> 04:50.285
Paratrinic shielding,
a dense energy matrix...

04:50.356 --> 04:51.880
bio-neural circuitry?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.152
Bio-neural?

04:54.494 --> 04:55.426
Whoa, back off.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.689
This could be dangerous.

04:56.763 --> 04:58.094
No, wait.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.896
lt's speaking to us.

05:03.002 --> 05:04.663
Speaking?

05:04.737 --> 05:06.432
ln duotronic algorithms.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.066
Hold on. My translation matrix
is interpreting.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.274
lt says it's injured.

05:12.345 --> 05:13.778
lt needs our help.

05:14.847 --> 05:18.044
lt's asking why it can't see...

05:18.117 --> 05:20.711
or feel its arms and legs.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.084
lt's terrified.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.098
Can you identify yourself?

07:17.970 --> 07:19.301
lt's saying that its memory's

07:19.372 --> 07:22.000
been damaged. lt doesn't
remember its name.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.000
Don't worry.

07:25.077 --> 07:26.772
We're going to help you.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.640
Crewman Lang
will remain with you.

07:31.717 --> 07:32.706
What do you think?

07:32.785 --> 07:34.116
An artificial intelligence?

07:34.187 --> 07:36.485
One that doesn't seem to
realize it's artificial.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.023
Maybe we should
tell it the truth,

07:38.090 --> 07:39.250
try to jog its memory.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.486
No. l don't want to risk
psychological trauma.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.789
Psychological trauma?

07:42.862 --> 07:44.227
Doc, this is a machine.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.788
One which is confused
and asking for our help.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.231
We should beam it aboard.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.326
Not until we know
what we're dealing with.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.428
Away mission protocols
dictate that we...

07:52.505 --> 07:54.097
Morality dictates
that we help.

07:54.173 --> 07:57.267
lt may not be flesh and blood,
but it's clearly in distress.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.405
Make way for the day shift.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.412
How's he doing?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.039
Well, let's see.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.549
l haven't heard from him
in almost five minutes,

08:05.618 --> 08:07.745
so he should be checking
in right about...

08:07.820 --> 08:09.219
Away team to Voyager.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.085
-...now.
-That's our Harry.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.886
lf l were you,
l'd watch out for your job.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.187
Go ahead, Ensign.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.194
We found the source
of the distress call.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.856
lt's some kind of artificial
intelligence-- badly damaged.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.899
The Doctor thinks
we should beam it aboard.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.867
You're in charge
of the away mission, Ensign.

08:22.935 --> 08:23.993
What do you think?

08:25.137 --> 08:28.470
Well... l think we
should help it if we can,

08:28.541 --> 08:30.475
but, as a precaution,
l recommend

08:30.543 --> 08:31.908
sealing off an Engineering Bay

08:32.044 --> 08:34.842
with a level-10 force field
and beaming it directly there.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.073
Agreed. Give us a few minutes.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.179
We're going to transport you
back to our ship.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.384
l'm Voyager's
Emergency Medical Hologram.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.526
A projection
of light and force fields,

08:49.595 --> 08:52.063
guided by an optronic
computer program.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.766
No... technically speaking,

08:58.838 --> 09:00.965
l suppose l'm not a real person.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.809
How's our patient?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.279
Complicated.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.373
lt uses bio-neural circuitry

09:11.450 --> 09:14.078
to mimic humanoid
synaptic functions.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.984
But its memory core is damaged.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.785
lt's suffering from
a technological form of amnesia.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.849
Any theories
as to what it might be?

09:20.927 --> 09:23.794
lt could be a probe
or a communications device.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.763
Whoever our friend is,
he wasn't alone.

09:25.831 --> 09:28.322
He claims to have been
traveling with a companion.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.028
lf there's
another one down there,

09:30.102 --> 09:31.626
it might give us a few answers.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.172
l'll be in Astrometrics
scanning the surface.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.730
Give our guest my regards.

09:35.808 --> 09:36.900
Of course, Captain.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.967
Lower the containment field.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.810
How are you?

09:47.320 --> 09:50.187
Well, that's
an interesting question.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.919
Ensign Kim and Lieutenant Torres
are attempting to repair your...

09:53.993 --> 09:55.426
damaged circuitry.

09:57.496 --> 10:00.932
That's... what l wanted
to talk to you about.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.525
You're not an organic being.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.230
You're technological.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.931
You're
an artificial intelligence

10:09.008 --> 10:11.442
embedded in a machine
of some kind.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.246
No, there's no mistake.

10:15.314 --> 10:18.112
We believe the damage
you suffered in the crash

10:18.184 --> 10:19.776
is causing your confusion.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.289
Look at it this way--

10:24.357 --> 10:26.154
you and l
have something in common.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.125
Just because
we're not organic beings

10:28.194 --> 10:30.219
doesn't mean
we're in any way inferior.

10:32.298 --> 10:36.962
Well... you're metallic,
over a meter in length...

10:37.036 --> 10:38.298
cylindrical.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.974
Oh, you're quite sleek,
actually.

10:43.509 --> 10:44.737
You're welcome.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.878
l'm detecting
no further technology

10:47.947 --> 10:49.278
on the planet's surface.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.442
Maybe the second device
was destroyed when it crashed.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.110
Scan for metallic particulates

10:54.186 --> 10:56.416
consistent with our friend
in Engineering.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.649
There are minute traces

10:57.723 --> 10:59.782
scattered
across the northern continent.

10:59.859 --> 11:00.951
lsolate.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.426
An impact crater.

11:09.802 --> 11:12.771
lt spans a radius
of 200 kilometers.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.567
And look at this.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.803
Heavy concentrations
of radiogenic decay

11:17.877 --> 11:19.674
in the crater walls...

11:19.745 --> 11:23.545
and the fracture gradients
are consistent...

11:23.616 --> 11:26.210
with a highly focused
explosion.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.448
Evidently we've
discovered its function.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.926
A weapon of mass destruction.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.431
l understand your concerns,

11:45.504 --> 11:47.972
but the device hasn't
shown itself to be hostile.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.940
Not yet, but it's only
a matter of time

11:50.009 --> 11:51.738
before it puts
the pieces together.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.711
All the more reason
we should talk to it;

11:53.779 --> 11:54.837
explain our concerns.

11:54.914 --> 11:57.280
Ask for help in defusing
its explosive components.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.611
lf it's programmed
to detonate,

11:58.684 --> 12:00.276
there's no telling
how it'll react.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.343
Agreed. We have to neutralize
the threat, now. Suggestions?

12:02.421 --> 12:03.854
Transport the device
off the ship

12:03.923 --> 12:06.118
and destroy it
before it harms anyone.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.184
Seven, this is a sentient
being we're talking about.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.592
Very well.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.925
Return it to the surface

12:11.997 --> 12:14.557
and deploy a warning buoy
to alert other vessels.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.827
l refuse to believe

12:15.901 --> 12:17.926
our only options are
to kill it or abandon it.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.664
What if we could separate

12:19.739 --> 12:22.264
the bio-neural circuitry
from the explosive?

12:22.341 --> 12:24.673
Take the weapon off-line,
but salvage the intelligence.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.768
They're fully integrated.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.335
Where would we store
the intelligence

12:27.413 --> 12:28.641
once we shut the device down?

12:28.714 --> 12:30.341
The answer's obvious.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.781
Download its synaptic patterns

12:31.851 --> 12:33.546
into a holographic matrix
like mine.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.109
Then what?

12:35.187 --> 12:36.620
Try to find out
where it came from

12:36.689 --> 12:37.883
and return it to its people.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.925
The device is extremely complex.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.119
One error and we'd
risk detonation.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.128
Saving a life
often entails risk.

12:45.197 --> 12:48.394
Harry, B'Elanna,
assist the Doctor.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.798
Thank you, Captain.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.302
At the first sign of danger,

12:51.370 --> 12:53.361
we transport it off the ship,
understood?

12:53.439 --> 12:54.565
Understood.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.507
l quite understand.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.513
l wouldn't like being
carried around, either.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.515
Of course you are.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.675
Who wouldn't be?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.678
We're taking you to Sick Bay.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.517
Because we're better equipped
to help you there.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.923
Deck 5.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.925
We're going to transfer
your intelligence

13:16.996 --> 13:18.258
to a holo-matrix.

13:19.665 --> 13:20.927
You should be pleased.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.900
ln a little while,
you're going to be

13:22.968 --> 13:24.458
walking around just like me.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.303
l'm not certain.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.808
Ensign Kim's configuring

13:30.876 --> 13:32.741
your physical parameters
as we speak.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.805
l'm sure you'll be
quite handsome.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.783
Are we ready to proceed?

13:39.852 --> 13:41.513
Whenever you are.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.057
Don't be alarmed.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.291
We have to access
some of your systems

13:53.365 --> 13:54.957
to enable the transfer.

13:57.336 --> 14:01.238
He says he wants to know
exactly what you're doing

14:01.307 --> 14:02.899
as you do it.

14:02.975 --> 14:04.533
This is a delicate procedure.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.271
l won't be able to concentrate

14:06.345 --> 14:08.905
if l have to give
a blow-by-blow description.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.643
You'll have to forgive
Lieutenant Torres.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.447
She's an excellent engineer.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.853
Unfortunately, she doesn't
share my bedside manner.

14:17.923 --> 14:20.118
Harry, would you mind?

14:20.192 --> 14:21.887
Uh, yeah, sure.

14:21.961 --> 14:25.055
Well, first we're going
to be setting up

14:25.130 --> 14:29.226
an active interlink between you
and the holo-systems.

14:29.301 --> 14:32.065
Uh, now, to do that,

14:32.137 --> 14:34.935
we're going to take
your program off-line

14:35.007 --> 14:38.101
while we resequence
your bio-neural circuitry.

14:39.912 --> 14:43.575
He says he can't allow you
to shut him down.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.651
l'm sorry, but
there's no other way.

14:48.654 --> 14:49.678
lt's arming itself.

14:49.755 --> 14:51.416
The detonation sequence
has begun.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.616
Sick Bay to Bridge.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.249
The device is going to detonate.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.486
Beam it off the ship.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.085
We've lost the transporter lock.

14:57.162 --> 14:58.527
Talk to it, Doctor.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.122
Please, you're going
to destroy yourself, and us.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.895
Detonation in 20 seconds.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.493
B'Elanna, send an EM pulse
through its power matrix.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.902
Maybe you can short it out.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.200
l'm on it.

15:08.274 --> 15:10.606
15 seconds.

15:10.676 --> 15:11.904
Please disarm yourself.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.807
We're just trying to help you.

15:13.879 --> 15:14.903
Ten seconds.

15:15.014 --> 15:15.912
Nine...

15:16.015 --> 15:17.505
lnitiating the pulse.

15:18.684 --> 15:21.152
Six... five...

15:22.187 --> 15:23.017
Now.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.323
lt worked.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.157
We've shut it down, Captain.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.921
You shouldn't have done that.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.694
l know you've gotten a little
attached to this thing, but...

15:36.769 --> 15:38.532
You lied.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.333
What are you talking about?

15:40.406 --> 15:42.806
You said you were trying
to transfer my neural patterns,

15:42.875 --> 15:44.775
but you were really trying
to shut me down.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.778
You're the artificial
intelligence.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.049
lt used the interlink

15:53.118 --> 15:54.710
to commandeer
the Doctor's program.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.186
Sick Bay to Bridge.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.156
Captain, respond.

16:00.192 --> 16:01.557
He's tapped
into the ship's systems--

16:01.627 --> 16:02.787
deactivated the com.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.226
He's locked us in, too.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.695
You tried to destroy me.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.891
We were only trying
to disarm you.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.026
l'm a weapon.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.797
Yes.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.201
Why didn't you tell me?

16:13.272 --> 16:14.432
lt was a precaution.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.736
We were afraid you
might be dangerous.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.242
Obviously, we were right.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.210
l couldn't let you destroy me.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.213
l have to complete my mission.

16:22.281 --> 16:23.839
You remember it now?

16:23.916 --> 16:27.283
Yes. l'm a long-range
tactical armor unit.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.014
l've been deployed
by my people.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.113
They're facing
a terrible threat--

16:31.190 --> 16:33.021
a hostile species.

16:33.092 --> 16:37.620
My companion unit was destroyed,
but l will reach my target.

16:37.696 --> 16:39.789
Your ship will take me there.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.891
Look, we'll try
and contact your people.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.766
lf you could tell us
who they are...

16:45.838 --> 16:47.772
l must resume my mission!

16:50.542 --> 16:51.804
The weapon's been rearmed.

16:51.877 --> 16:53.037
Security?

16:54.446 --> 16:56.073
They still can't gain access
to Sick Bay

16:56.148 --> 16:57.945
or any part of Deck 5,
for that matter.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.678
Get a transporter lock
on our people.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.118
We'll jettison the whole
damn section if we have to.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.121
l wouldn't recommend that,
Captain.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.625
lf you try to stop me again,
l'll detonate.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.595
Your ship and everyone on it
will be destroyed.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.695
l'm transferring a new heading
to the helm.

17:19.771 --> 17:23.299
You'll proceed to the
coordinates at maximum velocity.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.569
Doctor?

17:24.643 --> 17:26.440
He's gone.

17:26.512 --> 17:31.313
He's directing us to a system
2.3 light-years from here.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.283
ls that your home?

17:33.352 --> 17:34.649
lt's my target.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.915
The course l've plotted
bypasses enemy minefields.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.114
Don't deviate from it.

17:38.190 --> 17:40.317
Your ship won't be harmed.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.916
Once we've reached the system,

17:42.027 --> 17:43.824
you'll transport me
to my target.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.523
We won't help you wage war.

17:45.597 --> 17:49.328
This crew has a Prime Directive
that forbids us to interfere

17:49.401 --> 17:51.392
in the affairs of other species.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.062
You've already interfered.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.435
We were trying to help you.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.371
Until you discovered
my true nature.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.171
Then you tried to deactivate me.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.905
Just your explosive components,
not you.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.503
There's no distinction.

18:02.581 --> 18:03.878
l am what l am.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.883
Now alter course
or l'll detonate.

18:06.018 --> 18:10.648
lf you do that, you'll never
reach your target, will you?

18:10.722 --> 18:13.850
l am programmed to take
whatever measures are necessary

18:13.926 --> 18:15.518
to obtain my objective.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.186
Failing that,

18:17.262 --> 18:19.890
l'm to consider anyone
who tries to stop me an enemy.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.899
Now alter course,
and transfer your sensors to me,

18:23.001 --> 18:24.901
so l can monitor
your compliance.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.631
Release my crewmen
from Sick Bay first.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.765
l'm not programmed to negotiate.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.867
They'll remain where they are.

18:32.978 --> 18:33.910
Lay in the course,

18:34.046 --> 18:35.513
Mr. Paris.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.014
Transfer sensors to Sick Bay.

18:37.082 --> 18:40.051
A sound tactical decision,
Captain.

18:42.488 --> 18:43.819
Assemble the staff.

18:43.889 --> 18:47.052
We're going to find a way
to outsmart a smart bomb.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.360
lf we can shut down the force
fields around Sick Bay,

18:55.434 --> 18:57.231
l could get
a transporter lock on it.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.032
Even if you were successful,
we can't beam it far enough

19:00.105 --> 19:01.834
from the ship
to escape the blast.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.875
She's right.
Our best option is to disarm it.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.601
Good luck.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.406
lt's got
an internal sensor array.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.777
lf we try so much
as to loosen a screw...

19:09.848 --> 19:11.281
boom!

19:11.350 --> 19:13.841
Commander, l think
you should take a look at this.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.682
lt's a power node
l used to enhance

19:15.754 --> 19:16.880
the replicator system.

19:17.022 --> 19:19.547
l acquired it last week
on a trading mission.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.889
lt has transkinetic
energy regulators

19:22.027 --> 19:24.086
and bio-neural
control circuitry.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.790
Remind you of anything?

19:25.864 --> 19:27.263
Our friend in Sick Bay.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.197
l didn't make the connection
at first,

19:29.268 --> 19:31.463
but when l overheard
a few of the engineers

19:31.537 --> 19:32.765
talking about the weapon,

19:32.838 --> 19:35.329
l went back and l checked
the schematics on this.

19:35.407 --> 19:36.704
lt's the same technology.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.039
Who did you acquire it from?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.601
A merchant named Onquanii.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.237
Did he say where he got it?

19:42.314 --> 19:44.282
No, but he seemed
eager to trade.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.284
Maybe he'd tell us if we
make it worth his while.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.683
Scan for his vessel.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.552
lf you find him,
send an encoded message.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.523
Tell him about our problem.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.890
Aye, sir.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.895
lf we could tap
into the holo-projectors

19:57.963 --> 19:59.055
without his knowing it,

19:59.131 --> 20:00.758
we might be able
to shut him down.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.424
He changed all the access codes.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.196
The second we try
to decrypt them,

20:04.269 --> 20:06.169
he'll restart
the detonation sequence.

20:06.238 --> 20:07.569
Do you have a better idea?

20:07.639 --> 20:09.334
Yeah, let the Captain handle it.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.638
The last thing anyone
needs is my opinion.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.940
This is no time to be
feeling sorry for yourself.

20:14.012 --> 20:15.912
Chakotay lets me make
a command decision--

20:15.981 --> 20:17.539
what do l do?

20:17.616 --> 20:19.345
l beam a talking bomb on board.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.918
The first time l commanded
an away mission,

20:24.990 --> 20:27.481
l led my people into a cave
that l thought

20:27.559 --> 20:29.288
was a Cardassian
military installation.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.262
Turned out l'd mistaken
unstable mineral deposits

20:32.331 --> 20:33.730
for weapon signatures.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.391
There was a rock slide

20:35.467 --> 20:37.128
and we were stuck there
for three days.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.863
What did you do?

20:38.937 --> 20:41.963
We dug ourselves out
with our bare hands.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.505
Where are you going?

20:46.578 --> 20:47.602
To dig us out.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.783
You don't have
to do this, you know.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.479
lt's what l was programmed for.

20:55.554 --> 20:56.987
You're a sentient being.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.421
You don't have to be
a slave to your programming.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.220
Look at the Doctor.

21:01.293 --> 21:02.590
He's a tool--

21:02.661 --> 21:03.923
a holographic puppet.

21:04.062 --> 21:06.155
That puppet saved your life.

21:06.231 --> 21:07.220
lf it weren't for him,

21:07.299 --> 21:09.529
you'd still be damaged
and alone on that planet.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.126
He's the one that convinced me
to beam you aboard.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.332
And when we discovered
what you were

21:15.407 --> 21:18.706
and some people wanted
to destroy you,

21:18.777 --> 21:20.574
the Doctor defended
your right to exist.

21:20.646 --> 21:21.840
What's your point?

21:21.913 --> 21:25.440
Even though he was only
programmed to be a Doctor,

21:25.517 --> 21:27.678
he's become more than that.

21:27.753 --> 21:30.745
He's made friends,
he's piloted a starship,

21:30.822 --> 21:31.948
he even sings.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.888
Despite all of his achievements,

21:33.959 --> 21:35.859
did he ever stop being a Doctor?

21:35.927 --> 21:36.859
No, but...

21:36.928 --> 21:39.158
And l can't stop being a weapon.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.426
Look at yourself.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.266
You're already
much more than that.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.363
You've got a body now,
eyes to see with.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.874
The second you detonate,
that'll all be over.

21:50.942 --> 21:52.569
That's the nature
of what l am.

21:52.644 --> 21:53.838
lt doesn't have to be.

21:53.912 --> 21:55.903
We can give you
your own holo-matrix.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.744
You can exist
for as long as you want,

21:57.816 --> 22:01.912
accomplish anything
you set your mind to.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.716
The only thing
l want to accomplish

22:03.789 --> 22:05.381
is the destruction of my target.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.448
What is your target?

22:07.526 --> 22:09.858
A military installation
on Salina Prime,

22:09.928 --> 22:12.920
Grid 1 1, Vector 9341.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.623
Tell me about it.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.268
Who's the enemy?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.495
A ruthless, violent race

22:17.569 --> 22:19.400
that's threatening
to destroy my people.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.939
What else
do you know about them?

22:22.040 --> 22:23.940
What's their planet like?

22:24.076 --> 22:25.475
Are there forests?

22:25.544 --> 22:27.409
Wildlife?

22:27.479 --> 22:30.380
Schools for the children
of this violent race?

22:30.449 --> 22:32.883
l'm not programmed
with superfluous data.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.179
Well, lucky for you.

22:34.252 --> 22:35.776
You're aboard Voyager now

22:35.854 --> 22:38.084
and you have access
to our scanners.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.954
Why don't we take a closer look
at your target.

22:47.165 --> 22:50.293
A military installation,
as l told you.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.301
But it's manned.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.428
By soldiers.

22:52.504 --> 22:54.165
Who are going to suffer
because of you.

22:54.239 --> 22:55.638
Remember when you
were suffering?

22:55.707 --> 22:56.935
Blind and paralyzed?

22:57.008 --> 22:59.704
Do you really want to make
others go through that?

22:59.778 --> 23:01.302
l have a duty
to protect my people.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.438
l will not betray them.

23:02.514 --> 23:03.776
Now get out

23:03.849 --> 23:05.612
before l'm forced to harm you!

23:09.488 --> 23:10.978
Nice try.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.157
l'm reading a subspace surge
off our port bow.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.922
lt looks like a cloaked ship.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.120
That could be him.

23:18.196 --> 23:19.424
Onquanii travels
in a cloaked vessel.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.932
We're being hailed, audio only.

23:22.033 --> 23:23.227
Open a channel.

23:23.301 --> 23:25.929
Voyager, good to see you again.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.631
And you, sir.

23:27.706 --> 23:28.934
l received your message.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.736
Have you an intelligent weapon
in your possession?

23:31.810 --> 23:33.710
Actually,
we're in its possession.

23:33.779 --> 23:34.939
We're being held hostage.

23:35.046 --> 23:37.105
Do you know anything
about this weapon?

23:37.182 --> 23:38.945
lf l'm correct,

23:39.017 --> 23:42.509
it was created by a species
named the Druoda.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.919
l've studied their technology.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.116
Bring me aboard.

23:46.191 --> 23:48.022
l can assist you.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.122
You've deactivated
your com system?

23:54.199 --> 23:56.929
And reinforced the shielding
in this section.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.367
We won't be overheard.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.065
l'd have more faith
in your security precautions,

24:01.139 --> 24:03.903
if you weren't already at
the mercy of this weapon.

24:04.042 --> 24:07.136
We didn't know what it was
when we brought it aboard.

24:08.914 --> 24:13.647
This particular series has
a class-1 1 intelligence factor.

24:13.718 --> 24:19.054
lt's warp-capable,
fully armored, self-guiding.

24:19.124 --> 24:23.584
lt has a maximum range
of 80 light-years.

24:23.662 --> 24:26.290
lt can fly through an ion storm

24:26.364 --> 24:28.559
or an armada of hostile ships

24:28.633 --> 24:30.658
and still find its target.

24:30.735 --> 24:31.667
Charming.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.363
How do l get it off my ship?

24:33.438 --> 24:34.837
You can't,

24:34.906 --> 24:36.533
but l can.

24:36.608 --> 24:40.738
My transporter system
employs a dampening field,

24:40.812 --> 24:43.076
which disables the detonator

24:43.148 --> 24:45.878
until my engineers
can disarm it.

24:45.951 --> 24:47.646
That's a generous offer.

24:47.719 --> 24:50.620
Mind if l ask
what you expect in return?

24:50.689 --> 24:53.249
The device itself.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.089
l'm not about to hand over
a weapon of mass destruction

24:56.161 --> 24:57.287
to someone l just met.

24:57.362 --> 25:00.593
Oh, my business
is salvage, not war.

25:00.665 --> 25:04.260
l've no intention
of deploying it.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.394
But you might sell it

25:05.470 --> 25:06.903
to someone who does.

25:07.038 --> 25:08.767
l imagine you'd stand
to make quite a profit.

25:08.840 --> 25:13.038
l can make more profit
by selling off its components.

25:13.111 --> 25:17.912
The energy matrix alone
can power a fleet of starships

25:17.983 --> 25:21.043
and its intelligence core,
properly reprogrammed,

25:21.119 --> 25:23.019
can assist
in a variety of things

25:23.088 --> 25:24.419
from terraforming

25:24.489 --> 25:27.253
to planetary weather control.

25:27.325 --> 25:29.156
All right.
You can have the weapon

25:29.227 --> 25:31.218
as long as we keep
the energy matrix.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.924
That way we can be sure
no one ever deploys it.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.661
l'm afraid that's unacceptable.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.067
The energy matrix

25:39.137 --> 25:42.231
is one of the most
valuable components.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.832
l'm sorry. lt's not open
for negotiation.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.775
We could offer you
a few dilithium crystals

25:46.845 --> 25:48.437
in compensation.

25:48.513 --> 25:53.348
That matrix is worth
a thousand dilithium crystals.

25:53.418 --> 25:56.285
What if we threw in
a plasma manifold?

25:56.354 --> 25:59.812
l want the entire weapon
or it remains here.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.518
Captain?

26:01.593 --> 26:02.685
You seem awfully intent

26:02.761 --> 26:04.661
for someone only
interested in salvage.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.163
l'm sorry to waste your time.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.964
We'll have to find another way
to solve our problem.

26:15.874 --> 26:17.535
l wish you luck.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.614
Sorry, Captain,
l thought it would help.

26:23.682 --> 26:24.910
Bridge, report.

26:25.016 --> 26:27.314
The alien vessel
has opened fire.

26:27.385 --> 26:29.250
We've lost weapons and shields.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.913
Sick Bay to Captain.
What's happening?

26:31.056 --> 26:32.421
We're under attack.

26:32.490 --> 26:33.752
How many ships?

26:33.825 --> 26:35.349
One... off the port bow.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.689
Return fire.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.695
We can't.
Check your sensors.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.458
Our weapons are off-line.

26:41.566 --> 26:43.591
Force fields around
Sick Bay are destabilizing.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.932
He's trying to get a transporter
lock on the weapon.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.596
Remodulate the shields.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.335
No effect.

26:53.311 --> 26:54.938
What are you doing?

26:58.049 --> 26:59.880
The weapon's sending
an antimatter surge

26:59.951 --> 27:01.543
back through
the transporter beam.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.090
They've been destroyed.

27:11.162 --> 27:12.823
That wasn't necessary.

27:12.897 --> 27:14.888
They were an enemy.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.297
Maintain course.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.403
l've studied
the weapon's schematics.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.908
My nanoprobes can be adapted

27:24.976 --> 27:26.739
to disable its
bio-neural circuitry.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.506
However l would need
direct access

27:28.580 --> 27:29.911
to its primary control port.

27:30.015 --> 27:31.107
That means getting you

27:31.182 --> 27:33.082
into Sick Bay
without arousing suspicion.

27:33.151 --> 27:36.143
We could access the holo-matrix
controls above Sick Bay,

27:36.221 --> 27:38.917
disrupt the Doctor's program
long enough for Seven

27:38.990 --> 27:40.821
to inject the nanoprobes.

27:40.892 --> 27:43.087
How much time would you need?

27:43.161 --> 27:44.526
Approximately 20 seconds.

27:44.596 --> 27:47.121
Run a long-range scan
on that subspace minefield

27:47.198 --> 27:48.222
it warned us about.

27:48.299 --> 27:50.028
Calculate
their explosive yield...

27:50.101 --> 27:52.535
what kind of damage
they might to do the ship.

27:52.604 --> 27:53.935
Aye, Captain.

27:54.072 --> 27:55.505
What have you got in mind?

27:55.573 --> 27:57.097
l have a feeling
we're about to run

27:57.175 --> 27:59.143
into some unexpected trouble.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.068
We've analyzed
the alien minefield

28:30.141 --> 28:32.575
and calculated the effect
it would have on Voyager.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.737
l think l can simulate
the explosions

28:34.813 --> 28:37.611
with a well-timed disruption
to the inertial dampers.

28:37.682 --> 28:40.082
Of course, asking me
to give you a bumpy ride

28:40.151 --> 28:42.415
is like asking a virtuoso
to sing off-key.

28:42.487 --> 28:44.421
l'm sure you'll manage.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.457
The weapon has access
to our sensors.

28:46.524 --> 28:48.458
How do we make sure
it won't catch on?

28:48.526 --> 28:49.686
We've reconfigured
the sensor array

28:49.761 --> 28:51.353
to send it false telemetry.

28:51.429 --> 28:53.158
lt will believe
we're navigating a minefield.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.927
At least long enough for us
to get Seven to Sick Bay.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.092
How?

28:57.168 --> 28:58.601
Medical emergency.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.934
l intend to suffer
third-degree plasma burns

29:01.005 --> 29:02.870
during our encounter
with the mines.

29:02.941 --> 29:04.374
That's where l come in.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.535
Chief Cosmetics Officer,
at your service.

29:06.611 --> 29:08.875
Another hidden talent, Neelix?

29:09.013 --> 29:11.709
Well, l know my way around
a dermal regenerator.

29:11.783 --> 29:14.479
l should be able to simulate
a convincing wound.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.611
Okay. We get her inside.

29:16.688 --> 29:17.655
Then what?

29:17.722 --> 29:19.155
Commander Tuvok
will be in position

29:19.224 --> 29:20.885
to disrupt the Doctor's program.

29:20.992 --> 29:22.619
Once that happens, l will inject

29:22.694 --> 29:24.321
the nanoprobes
and disable the weapon.

29:24.395 --> 29:25.862
l'll inform the Captain.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.295
Get started.

29:27.365 --> 29:31.267
Do well on this mission, Neelix,
and maybe the Captain

29:31.336 --> 29:34.134
will promote you
to Senior Beautician.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.713
Assist me.

29:43.782 --> 29:44.714
With what?

29:44.783 --> 29:45.715
l'm trying to identify

29:45.784 --> 29:47.684
the malfunction
that caused me to crash,

29:47.752 --> 29:50.721
but several of my memory files
are still damaged.

29:50.789 --> 29:51.778
Restore them.

29:54.659 --> 29:56.149
We tried helping it before.

29:56.227 --> 29:57.524
Look where that got us.

29:57.595 --> 29:59.688
''When taken captive
by a hostile force

29:59.764 --> 30:02.927
seek out any opportunity
to engage the assailant.''

30:03.067 --> 30:04.932
Didn't you ever read
the Officers' Manual?

30:05.036 --> 30:06.401
Section 126.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.166
l don't think
Starfleet diplomacy

30:08.239 --> 30:09.831
is going to work this time.

30:09.908 --> 30:14.709
lf we cooperate, we'll be
giving it the advantage.

30:14.779 --> 30:16.212
lf there's even a chance

30:16.281 --> 30:17.748
that we can convince it
to change its mind...

30:17.816 --> 30:19.750
lt's a bomb, Harry.

30:19.818 --> 30:20.910
A sentient bomb.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.976
l said assist me!

30:27.692 --> 30:29.125
Where do we start?

30:29.194 --> 30:31.890
There are several disruptions
in my memory index,

30:31.963 --> 30:34.227
including a three
minute, 37 second gap

30:34.299 --> 30:36.392
just prior to the crash.

30:36.467 --> 30:39.561
A recursive search algorithm
might retrieve the missing data.

30:41.039 --> 30:42.131
There.

30:42.207 --> 30:45.301
You received
a subspace transmission--

30:45.376 --> 30:46.400
a command to alter course

30:46.477 --> 30:47.967
and head
toward the planet's surface.

30:48.112 --> 30:50.876
Looks like your landing
wasn't an accident.

30:54.485 --> 30:58.251
lt was an attempt by the enemy
to divert me from my target.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.450
No, your access codes
are encrypted.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.392
They must've developed
an infiltration code.

31:03.461 --> 31:04.894
What if it wasn't the enemy?

31:04.963 --> 31:06.897
Who else would try to divert me?

31:06.965 --> 31:08.432
Correct me if l'm wrong,

31:08.499 --> 31:10.763
but these are
the same duotronic algorithms

31:10.835 --> 31:12.666
that you use
to communicate with.

31:12.737 --> 31:16.070
My own people wouldn't try
to stop me.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.835
Maybe they changed their mind.

31:17.909 --> 31:19.433
The enemy is ruthless.

31:19.510 --> 31:21.034
My target is a threat.

31:21.112 --> 31:23.637
Why would my people call off
the assault?

31:23.715 --> 31:26.309
lf we clear up
some more of these memory files,

31:26.384 --> 31:27.817
maybe we'll find out.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.787
Your assistance is
no longer required.

31:30.855 --> 31:31.787
What's wrong?

31:31.856 --> 31:32.948
You afraid you might find out

31:33.024 --> 31:34.958
you're not supposed to
destroy that installation?

31:35.026 --> 31:35.958
Let us finish the job.

31:36.094 --> 31:36.958
Then you can decide

31:37.095 --> 31:38.995
what you want to do
with the information.

31:40.698 --> 31:42.188
Proceed.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.802
Does the name
''Strategic Command Matrix''

31:49.874 --> 31:50.932
mean anything to you?

31:51.009 --> 31:52.408
That's my control center.

31:52.477 --> 31:53.876
They ordered my launch.

31:53.945 --> 31:57.176
Well, it looks like your
orders were rescinded.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.476
See for yourself.

31:58.549 --> 32:00.608
''All long-range
tactical armor units...

32:01.686 --> 32:05.053
terminate mission immediately.''

32:05.123 --> 32:06.488
Keep reading.

32:06.557 --> 32:10.288
lt says... the war is over.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.329
lt ended nearly three years ago.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.798
My launch was a mistake.

32:15.867 --> 32:19.268
There was a malfunction
in one of the command sensors.

32:19.337 --> 32:22.033
lt activated a series
of launch sequencers.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.664
My people managed
to shut most of them down,

32:23.741 --> 32:26.642
but 34 weapons were fired...

32:26.711 --> 32:28.144
including me.

32:28.212 --> 32:31.613
l guess this means
you can disarm yourself now.

32:31.683 --> 32:35.813
No. There's no
confirmation code here.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.149
We avoided
the enemy's minefield,

32:37.221 --> 32:38.483
so they're trying to deceive us.

32:38.556 --> 32:39.648
The confirmation

32:39.724 --> 32:41.817
could be in one of your
damaged memory files.

32:41.893 --> 32:42.951
Or maybe it was you

32:43.094 --> 32:45.619
deceiving me to implement
your pacifist philosophy.

32:45.697 --> 32:46.629
That's not true.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.630
You lied to me before.

32:47.699 --> 32:48.757
Why should l trust you now?

32:48.833 --> 32:50.960
You don't have to trust us,
just access those files.

32:51.035 --> 32:51.967
No!

32:52.070 --> 32:53.901
l am programmed
to destroy my target.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.872
l will complete my mission!

32:55.940 --> 32:58.841
lf the war is over, you could
end up starting another one.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.400
How many of your people
will die then?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.107
Sick Bay to Bridge.

33:04.182 --> 33:05.114
Report.

33:05.183 --> 33:06.514
We've run into a subspace mine.

33:06.584 --> 33:07.778
We had to drop out of warp.

33:07.852 --> 33:10.082
There shouldn't be mines
along this course.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.587
We're detecting
thousands of them

33:11.656 --> 33:12.782
scattered throughout the region.

33:12.857 --> 33:14.620
We're plotting a new
course to avoid them.

33:14.692 --> 33:17.092
Transmit it to me.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.925
This trajectory will delay us
for two days.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.262
That'll give you time
to confirm that the war is over.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.392
No! Proceed as planned.

33:24.469 --> 33:27.302
l'm programming
a shield enhancement

33:27.372 --> 33:28.839
that will protect Voyager.

33:28.906 --> 33:30.737
l'm still going
to have to reduce speed.

33:31.876 --> 33:36.040
Agreed, but only until
we've cleared the minefield.

33:36.114 --> 33:39.447
Maintain course, Mr. Paris,
one-quarter impulse.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.280
Think he bought it?

33:41.352 --> 33:42.785
He seemed to.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.789
Let's give him another
good shake just to be sure.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.586
Yes, ma'am.

33:49.527 --> 33:50.892
That was another mine.

33:50.962 --> 33:52.862
The shields will hold.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.000
Tuvok to Bridge.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.631
l've accessed the holo-matrix.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.141
Acknowledged.

34:05.209 --> 34:08.143
Janeway to Neelix.
Casualty report.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.409
l'm putting the finishing
touches on Seven's plasma burn

34:11.482 --> 34:14.918
and it looks pretty authentic,
if l do say so myself.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.011
Good work. Stand by.

34:17.088 --> 34:20.148
Time to hit another mine, Tom--
a big one.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.784
Commander, blow out
the plasma relays on Deck 6.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.260
Janeway to Sick Bay.

34:25.329 --> 34:27.092
We have heavy casualties.

34:27.165 --> 34:29.257
Maintain heading and speed.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.425
That's going to be difficult.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.400
Our Astrometrics Officer
has been injured.

34:32.469 --> 34:35.098
She's the one who's been guiding
us through the minefield.

34:35.172 --> 34:36.105
Replace her.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.039
Seven of Nine's abilities
are unique.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.507
We're not going to get past

34:39.577 --> 34:41.601
these mines without her.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.204
Then treat her injuries
and send her back to her post.

34:44.282 --> 34:45.909
She has third-degree
plasma burns.

34:45.983 --> 34:48.042
She needs to go to Sick Bay
to be treated.

34:48.119 --> 34:49.848
lf you want to reach
your target,

34:49.920 --> 34:51.513
you're going to have to wait.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.221
All right, Captain,
but l'm warning you...

34:56.293 --> 34:58.888
no deceptions.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.897
Janeway to Neelix.

35:01.966 --> 35:03.831
Go.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.269
Treat her as quickly
as possible.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.209
They're in.

35:17.281 --> 35:18.578
Now, Tuvok.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.418
Bridge, my holo-matrix
is destabilizing.

35:25.490 --> 35:26.923
Why?

35:26.991 --> 35:29.551
We took damage
to our secondary systems.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.719
Repair them.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.231
Now! Or l'll activate
the detonation sequence.

35:34.298 --> 35:36.266
Stand by.

35:37.502 --> 35:38.935
What's going on?

35:39.003 --> 35:41.471
She's trying
to defuse the weapon.

35:50.648 --> 35:51.615
Seven!

35:56.954 --> 35:58.888
She's going into neural shock.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.423
Help me.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.790
Sick Bay to Bridge.

36:10.868 --> 36:13.803
Your attempt to disable me
did not succeed.

36:13.871 --> 36:15.634
l am designed to repel

36:15.706 --> 36:18.072
any assault
on my bio-neural circuitry.

36:18.142 --> 36:20.269
We've tried to reason with you.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.868
You left me no choice.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.538
And you leave me no choice.

36:23.614 --> 36:25.912
You and your crew will
abandon Voyager immediately.

36:28.152 --> 36:29.642
No deal.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.278
This is not a negotiation!

36:31.355 --> 36:32.913
Comply or l will detonate!

36:33.024 --> 36:35.492
Go ahead. Do it.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.324
Everyone on board
will be killed!

36:38.396 --> 36:40.887
But no one else will.

36:42.466 --> 36:45.924
Captain, 32 vessels
just dropped out of warp

36:46.070 --> 36:47.435
off our port bow.

36:47.505 --> 36:48.904
On screen.

37:10.027 --> 37:12.291
One of them is transmitting
a message...

37:12.363 --> 37:13.694
to the ''Doctor.''

37:13.764 --> 37:15.163
Bridge to Sick Bay.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.862
We've got company--
32 self-guided weapons.

37:18.936 --> 37:21.700
They detected my presence
aboard your vessel.

37:21.772 --> 37:24.240
They say my target is essential.

37:24.308 --> 37:26.299
They altered course
to ensure that l reach it.

37:26.377 --> 37:28.868
They are ordering me
to transport off your vessel.

37:28.946 --> 37:30.709
They will tractor me
to my target.

37:30.781 --> 37:33.272
Mr. Kim, reintegrate
its neural matrix,

37:33.351 --> 37:34.283
and prepare to beam it off...

37:34.352 --> 37:35.284
We can't do that, Captain.

37:35.353 --> 37:36.285
Explain.

37:36.354 --> 37:37.548
These weapons were
fired by accident.

37:37.622 --> 37:38.850
We can't let them
reach their targets.

37:38.923 --> 37:42.381
Enough! Captain,
order him to proceed!

37:42.460 --> 37:43.552
Harry, what are you
talking about?

37:43.628 --> 37:45.596
Captain, l need a minute.

37:45.663 --> 37:47.062
You're making a mistake.

37:47.131 --> 37:49.122
Your own people
tried to disarm you.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.428
l cannot be certain of that.

37:50.501 --> 37:51.559
Yes, you can.

37:51.636 --> 37:53.069
You can check your memory files.

37:53.137 --> 37:54.069
Look for the confirmation code.

37:54.138 --> 37:55.730
No more delays.

37:55.806 --> 37:57.137
Check the files.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.573
-Reintegrate my matrix.
-No!

37:58.643 --> 38:00.838
Do what Harry says
or you're not leaving this ship.

38:00.911 --> 38:02.879
You're in no position
to give me orders.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.208
lf you detonate now,

38:04.282 --> 38:06.443
you'll destroy yourself
and your companions.

38:06.517 --> 38:07.711
ls that what you want?

38:09.220 --> 38:11.984
The confirmation code.

38:18.095 --> 38:21.531
Coding intersequence
443, vector 39121.

38:21.599 --> 38:25.035
Cessation of hostilities...
confirmed.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.764
Unauthorized launch...
confirmed.

38:27.838 --> 38:31.433
Order to terminate mission...
confirmed.

38:31.509 --> 38:32.908
You must disarm yourself

38:33.010 --> 38:35.001
and tell the others
to stand down.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.273
lt's a deception.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.815
This code of yours uses
a modulating algorithm.

38:38.883 --> 38:41.181
lt would be almost
impossible to duplicate.

38:41.252 --> 38:42.913
The enemy is ruthless;
they are violent.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.214
Have you ever met the enemy?

38:44.288 --> 38:45.653
You're just spouting propaganda,

38:45.723 --> 38:47.418
what you've been
programmed to believe.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.685
l have a directive.

38:48.759 --> 38:49.691
lt's been countermanded!

38:49.760 --> 38:51.193
l am a Series 5, long-range

38:51.262 --> 38:53.662
tactical armor unit
designed to traverse enemy space

38:53.731 --> 38:55.596
and circumvent
all attempts to deter me.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.759
You're a sentient being.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.632
l have a duty
to protect my people,

38:59.704 --> 39:01.035
to destroy my target!

39:01.105 --> 39:02.868
You've been programmed
with intelligence,

39:03.007 --> 39:04.872
so you could make decisions
on your own.

39:04.942 --> 39:06.273
Well, it's time to make one.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.811
Countless lives are at stake!

39:16.620 --> 39:18.520
Ever since you took
the Doctor's form,

39:18.589 --> 39:21.251
you've been learning what
it's like to be one of us.

39:21.325 --> 39:22.417
Now, try to imagine

39:22.493 --> 39:24.552
what it's like to be
one of your victims--

39:24.628 --> 39:26.061
your first victim.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.461
You've seen her suffering.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.726
lncrease that by a
factor of one million--

39:29.800 --> 39:30.892
ten million--

39:31.035 --> 39:32.832
and that's how much
suffering you'll cause

39:32.903 --> 39:34.700
if you don't end this.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.110
They're asking why l
haven't left your ship.

39:41.178 --> 39:42.406
Tell them.

39:44.782 --> 39:47.273
l'm transmitting our orders
to terminate the mission.

39:51.922 --> 39:53.549
They also received those orders,

39:53.624 --> 39:56.593
but they had already crossed
the targeting threshold.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.424
Once we're within two
light-years of our target,

39:59.497 --> 40:00.794
we cannot be diverted.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.424
Tell them the war's over.

40:04.502 --> 40:05.264
l did.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.928
Tell them you got the message

40:07.004 --> 40:08.369
before you crossed the threshold

40:08.439 --> 40:10.100
when you were
on the planet's surface.

40:13.944 --> 40:15.104
They don't believe me.

40:15.179 --> 40:17.477
lt's up to you
to make them understand.

40:17.548 --> 40:19.516
They only understand
their directive.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.346
They won't listen.

40:24.955 --> 40:28.413
Reintegrate my neural matrix
and return me to the others.

40:28.492 --> 40:29.891
We won't do that.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.428
l have no intention
of proceeding to my target.

40:32.496 --> 40:34.464
l will stop them.

40:34.532 --> 40:35.556
How?

40:35.633 --> 40:38.466
l am a weapon
of mass destruction.

40:40.104 --> 40:43.198
You want me to see
past my programming...

40:43.274 --> 40:46.869
then you must try
to see past your doubts.

40:49.346 --> 40:50.313
B'Elanna...

40:50.381 --> 40:52.349
give me a hand.

40:55.319 --> 40:57.981
Bridge, lock on to the weapon.
Prepare to beam it into space.

40:58.055 --> 40:59.613
Harry, what's going on?

40:59.690 --> 41:01.180
Captain, no time to explain.

41:01.258 --> 41:02.657
Just trust me on this one.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.455
l hear you loud and clear,
Ensign.

41:04.528 --> 41:06.086
Do it.

41:07.498 --> 41:09.659
l've reconfigured
the bio-neural matrix.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.003
Ready?

41:15.005 --> 41:16.870
l'm sorry.

41:16.941 --> 41:19.501
l am simply completing
my mission.

41:19.577 --> 41:21.738
Only the target has changed.

41:32.423 --> 41:33.947
Transfer complete.

41:34.058 --> 41:35.525
Please state the nature
of the...

41:35.593 --> 41:37.618
What happened?
How long was l off-line?

41:37.695 --> 41:40.129
We'll explain later.
Seven needs your help.

41:40.197 --> 41:42.927
Bridge, energize.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.481
They've gone into warp.

42:05.556 --> 42:07.490
Maintain long-range sensors.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.159
l'm detecting a series
of antimatter explosions.

42:21.238 --> 42:22.933
ln proximity to what?

42:23.073 --> 42:25.871
No ships, no planets...

42:25.943 --> 42:27.205
nothing.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.075
Bridge to Ensign Kim.

42:29.146 --> 42:31.171
The weapons have been destroyed.

42:42.126 --> 42:43.184
Anyone home?

42:43.260 --> 42:45.421
Ensign.

42:45.496 --> 42:46.895
Feeling well, l hope.

42:46.964 --> 42:48.192
Perfect.

42:48.265 --> 42:50.324
On my way to the Bridge
for another night shift.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.595
Came by to check on Seven.

42:51.669 --> 42:52.966
You just missed her.

42:53.103 --> 42:54.468
What's her prognosis?

42:54.538 --> 42:56.335
She'll need another week
of regeneration,

42:56.407 --> 42:58.170
but l expect
she'll make a full recovery.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.607
Good news.

42:59.677 --> 43:01.804
Oh, considering l was
responsible for her injuries,

43:01.879 --> 43:03.073
you can imagine my relief.

43:03.147 --> 43:05.377
Well, you weren't exactly
yourself at the time.

43:05.449 --> 43:07.178
That's not what l mean.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.809
l was the one who asked you

43:08.886 --> 43:11.013
to bring that device aboard
in the first place.

43:11.088 --> 43:13.318
l even argued with the Captain
to keep it aboard

43:13.390 --> 43:15.324
after we learned what it was.

43:15.392 --> 43:17.383
''lt'' was an artificial
intelligence, like you,

43:17.461 --> 43:19.395
but l have to admit,

43:19.463 --> 43:22.330
his personality made you
seem like Mr. Congeniality.

43:23.634 --> 43:24.896
Look, Doc, the truth is,

43:24.969 --> 43:27.665
l never would've gotten
through to him without you.

43:27.738 --> 43:31.606
From what l heard,
l wasn't much help.

43:31.675 --> 43:32.733
You were.

43:32.810 --> 43:34.107
l held you up as an example

43:34.178 --> 43:35.770
of how
an artificial intelligence

43:35.846 --> 43:37.837
could exceed its programming.

43:37.915 --> 43:41.976
l didn't realize how true
that was... until today.

43:44.021 --> 43:45.955
lt seems your strategy worked.

43:46.023 --> 43:48.048
Thank you.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.717
l better get to the Bridge.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.556
You never know when Ensign Kim

43:51.629 --> 43:53.756
will be called upon
to take command again.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.563
Voyager could do worse.

44:09.279 --> 44:10.746
Helm, status.

44:10.814 --> 44:14.648
Current speed-- warp 5.
Heading-- 021 mark 3.

44:14.718 --> 44:16.310
Anything on long-range sensors?

44:16.387 --> 44:18.014
Nothing to report.

44:18.088 --> 44:19.715
As you were.

44:20.924 --> 44:23.586
Permission to speak freely, sir.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.561
Why would tonight
be any different?

44:25.629 --> 44:27.358
People have been
talking about you.

44:27.431 --> 44:28.921
Oh?

44:29.033 --> 44:32.059
Rumor has it you were the one
who outsmarted the smart bomb.

44:32.136 --> 44:34.070
Well... not exactly.

44:34.138 --> 44:36.800
l made first contact
with a sentient being.

44:36.874 --> 44:39.741
All l did was help it
understand a few things.

44:39.810 --> 44:41.243
The rest was up to him.

44:41.311 --> 44:43.245
Understood.

44:43.313 --> 44:46.043
Actually, l've been authorized
by the junior staff

44:46.116 --> 44:48.414
to thank you for keeping
us in one piece.

44:48.485 --> 44:49.918
You're welcome.

44:49.987 --> 44:52.217
Any time.

44:52.289 --> 44:53.813
Do me a favor.

44:53.891 --> 44:55.324
Of course, sir.

44:55.392 --> 44:56.950
No more distress calls.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.494
At least not tonight.
