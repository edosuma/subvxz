00:09.802 --> 00:12.346
Hey, Nicky,

00:09.802 --> 00:12.346
where are you from?

00:12.387 --> 00:13.806
I don't know.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.265
Oh, "I don't know."

00:15.307 --> 00:17.184
Okay, well, we'll get back

00:15.307 --> 00:17.184
to you on that one.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.936
Okay and let it rip.

00:20.312 --> 00:22.314
Oh! Oh, gutter ball!

00:22.356 --> 00:24.817
So close,

00:22.356 --> 00:24.817
yet so far away.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.819
Okay, next up

00:24.859 --> 00:26.819

00:26.861 --> 00:29.070
And, Alex, what is

00:26.861 --> 00:29.070
your strategy today?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.199
I don't know.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.369
Ooh, obviously he is not

00:32.240 --> 00:35.369
gonna tip his hand, folks.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.704
Okay, go for it.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.164
Oh!

00:41.166 --> 00:43.042
Uh, boys,

00:41.166 --> 00:43.042
the objective of the game

00:43.084 --> 00:45.212
is to try and knock<i> some</i>

00:43.084 --> 00:45.212
of the pins down.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.426
Oh, unbelievable!

00:48.298 --> 00:51.426
A perfect game!

Yes, high fives!

Hey, guys.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.692
What's up?

01:48.734 --> 01:49.985
- How are you?

01:48.734 --> 01:49.985
- Hey, how are you doing, Steve?

01:50.027 --> 01:51.403
Hey, where's DJ?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.947
I think she's up, doing

01:51.445 --> 01:52.947
her hair. Have a seat.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.365
Oh, no way. Sorry,

01:52.988 --> 01:55.365
I can't wait two hours.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.701
Two hours

01:56.408 --> 01:57.701
on her hair?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.244
Hope she's not

01:57.743 --> 01:59.244
cutting corners.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.289
Well, I'll just

02:00.370 --> 02:02.289
leave her a note.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.791
Ew.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.460
I got hair

02:03.832 --> 02:06.460
in my cereal.

02:08.003 --> 02:10.005
Boy, the prizes aren't

02:08.003 --> 02:10.005
what they used to be.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.216
You know, what, I think

02:11.381 --> 02:13.216
we can solve this problem

02:13.258 --> 02:14.927
with a little hairspray

02:13.258 --> 02:14.927
and a hairbrush.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.511
I hate hairspray.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.681
It makes my face

02:16.553 --> 02:19.681
all sticky.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.354
gotta go, I'm in a rush.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.690
I've got a Shakespeare test

Hey, don't take it

02:28.732 --> 02:30.233

02:39.159 --> 02:41.870
Check this out, I rigged up

02:39.159 --> 02:41.870
this little gizmo one day

02:41.912 --> 02:43.413
when I hairsprayed

02:41.912 --> 02:43.413

02:43.455 --> 02:45.124
So, you just put it

02:43.455 --> 02:45.124
on like that

02:45.165 --> 02:47.876
and bada boom, you got yourself

02:45.165 --> 02:47.876
uh, no spray in the face.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.128
Alright, Michelle,

02:47.918 --> 02:49.128
come over here

02:49.168 --> 02:50.796

02:51.505 --> 02:53.423
Okay, now up you go.

Put the little gizmo

02:53.465 --> 02:55.425
in front of your face.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.136
There you go,

02:55.467 --> 02:57.136

03:18.323 --> 03:20.784
leave it to your Uncle J.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.201
Thanks, Uncle Jesse.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.172
see that thing.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.509
This is a very ingenious

03:34.798 --> 03:37.509
little gadget.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.302
You know, I'll bet you

03:37.551 --> 03:39.302
we could sell these.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.929
You know, there's a lot

03:39.344 --> 03:40.929
of people out there

03:40.971 --> 03:42.931
making a fortune and selling

03:40.971 --> 03:42.931
stuff just like this.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.852
from a motor cycle helmet, eh.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.311
We can't make any

03:46.894 --> 03:48.311
money on that.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.022
Yeah, let me tell you

03:48.353 --> 03:50.022
about some devices

03:50.064 --> 03:52.066

03:50.064 --> 03:52.066
make money on, okay?

03:57.612 --> 03:59.573
People will buy anything.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.617
Hey, that gas-powered toothbrush

03:59.614 --> 04:02.617
got great mileage.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.747
Okay, it is a little hard

04:04.327 --> 04:06.747
to start on a cold morning.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.959
You really think we could make

04:08.623 --> 04:10.959

Well, DJ's upstairs.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.145
She might care.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.690
I can't tell DJ.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.942
Really?

05:58.984 --> 06:00.735
Is it about her?

She said she was gonna

Maybe they're

06:29.348 --> 06:30.849
studying German.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.477

I don't know

06:36.021 --> 06:37.438
what to do.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.359
If I tell DJ,

06:37.480 --> 06:40.359
it's gonna break her heart.

Okay, before you lay

06:40.399 --> 06:43.111
this one on DJ

06:43.153 --> 06:45.613
you better find out if Steve

06:43.153 --> 06:45.613
really is a cheating dog.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.782
- Will you help me?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.782
- Sure.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.201
But on one condition

06:49.243 --> 06:51.203
after, can we go back

06:49.243 --> 06:51.203
to hating each other?

06:51.245 --> 06:53.330
- 'Cause I missed that.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.330
- Of course.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.499
- I think it's good.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.499
- That's good.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.584
Alright.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.584
Guess what, Beck?

06:57.625 --> 06:59.418
- We did it.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.418
- Did what?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.713
Well, we all chipped in

06:59.460 --> 07:01.713
and-and we bought some time

07:01.755 --> 07:03.006
on the station's

07:01.755 --> 07:03.006
home shopping show.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.465
There's an open spot.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.344
The underpants elasticizer

07:04.507 --> 07:07.344
guy went broke.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.137
We're going

07:07.386 --> 07:09.137
on the air, live.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.931
In a few hours, we're gonna be

07:09.179 --> 07:10.931
introducing the world

07:10.972 --> 07:12.682
to the Spray Guard 2000.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.059
- And 1.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.687
Moe, Larry, Curly..

07:17.729 --> 07:18.897
...you guys

07:17.729 --> 07:18.897
have lost it.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.232
You can't

07:18.939 --> 07:20.232
go on tonight.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.775
Beck, we have to,

07:20.274 --> 07:21.775
if-if we don't do it now

07:21.816 --> 07:23.443
someone's gonna be

07:21.816 --> 07:23.443
selling this thing tomorrow.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.905
Jess, you only have one

07:23.484 --> 07:26.905
of those Spray Guard 2000s--

07:26.947 --> 07:28.198
- And 1.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.701
Hey, we'll just glue up

07:29.824 --> 07:31.701
a couple of dozen

07:31.743 --> 07:32.994
of those poppies

07:31.743 --> 07:32.994
for the display

07:33.036 --> 07:34.579
and slap together

07:33.036 --> 07:34.579
the other million

07:34.621 --> 07:36.831
when the orders

07:34.621 --> 07:36.831
start come in, hmm.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.166
Slap and glue.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.085
That sounds like

07:38.208 --> 07:40.085
quality control to me.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.633
Come on.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.633
Hurry up.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.219
Relax, Steve and DJ won't be

07:46.674 --> 07:49.219
back from the movie

07:49.261 --> 07:50.637
for a couple

07:49.261 --> 07:50.637
of hours.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.890
Yes.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.482
Okay, Columbo, we've gotta

07:59.187 --> 08:02.482
find something incriminating

08:02.523 --> 08:05.444
a love letter, a photo,

08:02.523 --> 08:05.444
something that says

08:05.485 --> 08:07.737
he's got a little sweet pea

08:05.485 --> 08:07.737
stashed on the side.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.575
Whoa.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.538
I'd say this

08:14.953 --> 08:17.538
<i>screams</i> sweet pea.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.874
I don't know.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.418
Steve could lie

08:19.916 --> 08:21.418
and say it's his

08:23.337 --> 08:24.921
or maybe it is his.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.048
Ew.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.343
[telephone ringing]

08:31.303 --> 08:32.429
Quick, hide.

08:32.471 --> 08:33.596
Oh!

08:39.686 --> 08:40.812
Hello?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.773
Oh, hi, Shelly.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.900
I'm good,

08:43.815 --> 08:45.900
but I'm kinda crazed.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.362
There's<i> so</i> much to do

08:45.942 --> 08:48.362
before the wedding.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.737
[gasping]

08:51.781 --> 08:54.409
'I can't wait

08:51.781 --> 08:54.409
till we're married.'

08:54.451 --> 08:56.244
I've got to go, but um..

08:56.286 --> 08:57.787
...I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

08:58.497 --> 08:59.831
Bye.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.881
[instrumental music]

09:07.922 --> 09:09.257
I don't believe it.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.176
Steve's living

09:09.299 --> 09:11.176
a double life.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.552
Like on "Oprah".

09:14.304 --> 09:17.015
People married to two people

09:14.304 --> 09:17.015
at the same time.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.976
Oh, my God.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.976
Steve's a botanist.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.153
Well, now we<i> know</i>

09:28.276 --> 09:30.153
Steve's a two-timer.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.572
- Let's get outta here.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.572
- Good idea.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.490
[Steve laughing]

09:33.532 --> 09:35.867
(DJ)

09:33.532 --> 09:35.867
'I know.'

09:35.909 --> 09:38.453
Hide. Go, go, go.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.041
Oh, I hope you're not too bummed

09:40.580 --> 09:43.041
the movie was sold out.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.710
Hey, Deej, who cares

09:43.083 --> 09:45.710
about the movie?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.381
We've gotta tell her.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.092
Why? She'll figure it out

09:49.423 --> 09:52.092
when she sees towel-girl.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.594
You're right.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.137
We'll sneak out

09:54.635 --> 09:56.137
during the catfight.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.183
Hey, look, Deej,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.183
I'm sorry we have

10:00.225 --> 10:01.268
to make this

10:00.225 --> 10:01.268
such an early night

10:01.309 --> 10:03.186
but you know,

10:01.309 --> 10:03.186
I've gotta study.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.854
It's okay.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.854
I understand.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.442
Ow, I got a cramp

10:05.939 --> 10:08.442
in my foot.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.026
Shh!

10:10.068 --> 10:13.613
You're the best, you'll always

10:10.068 --> 10:13.613
be the only one for me.

10:13.654 --> 10:17.242
Well, you will be

10:13.654 --> 10:17.242
the only,<i> only one</i> for me.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.453
Oh, yeah, well, you'll

10:17.284 --> 10:19.453
always be the only

10:19.494 --> 10:20.995
only, onliest one for me.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.372
[laughing]

10:27.502 --> 10:28.711
Steve?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.922
Edie, what are you

10:28.753 --> 10:30.922
doing here?

10:33.425 --> 10:36.303
Uh, I thought you were gonna

10:33.425 --> 10:36.303
visit your fiance.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.264
Yeah, I'm heading

10:37.720 --> 10:39.264
over there right now.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.848
Are you enjoying

10:39.306 --> 10:40.848
your visit?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.601
Steve's the greatest host.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.312
He's always been

10:42.642 --> 10:45.312
my favorite cousin.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.230
Cousin?

10:48.231 --> 10:50.108
They're cousins?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.193
Steve's marrying

10:50.150 --> 10:52.193
his cousin?

10:54.988 --> 10:55.989
- Alright, cool.

10:54.988 --> 10:55.989
- Have fun.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.115
- Take care.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.115
- See you soon

10:57.157 --> 10:58.492
- Bye-bye, you guys.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.492
- Bye.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.704
Ow. Uh, these boots

11:00.868 --> 11:03.704
are killing me.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.956
- Uh.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.956
- Oh.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.707
- Huff.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.707
- Ew.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.589
Ew.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.469
Steve, what's that smell?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.680
God, I have no idea.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.391
Well, my-my goldfish

11:21.722 --> 11:23.391
died last week

11:23.433 --> 11:24.934
but we flushed him.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.354
Oh.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.481
[sniffs]

11:41.075 --> 11:44.703
Steve, uh, what

11:41.075 --> 11:44.703
are you doing here, huh?

11:44.745 --> 11:47.123
What are you guys

11:44.745 --> 11:47.123
doing here?

11:47.165 --> 11:49.042
Well, uh, it's

11:47.165 --> 11:49.042
kind of a long story

11:49.083 --> 11:51.127
and I don't really wanna

11:49.083 --> 11:51.127
bore you with the details.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.753
Right, no harm.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.753
No foul.

11:52.795 --> 11:53.838
Glad I could be

11:52.795 --> 11:53.838
of help, Steph.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.756
Thank you, Kimmy.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.924
Hold it. Hold it.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.301
You guys aren't

11:56.966 --> 11:58.301
going anywhere.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.886
I wanna know

11:58.343 --> 11:59.886
what are you're doing here.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.639
Well, I kinda gotta

11:59.927 --> 12:02.639
the wrong idea

12:02.681 --> 12:04.641
when I saw Steve

12:02.681 --> 12:04.641
and Edie at the library.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.768
Wait-Wait, you think

12:06.017 --> 12:07.768
I could cheat on DJ?

12:07.810 --> 12:11.064
I can't believe you

12:07.810 --> 12:11.064
violated our privacy.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.815
You know, you're lucky

12:11.105 --> 12:12.815
Steve doesn't call the cops.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.026
Now, hey, Deej, I mean

12:12.857 --> 12:15.026
don't overreact here.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.361
It's not like

12:15.068 --> 12:16.361
they stole anything.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.489
Alright,

12:17.736 --> 12:19.489
one bag of M&Ms.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.284
But I was gonna

12:21.824 --> 12:23.284
pay you back.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.829
It was all

12:24.202 --> 12:26.829
Nancy Drew's idea.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.122
She begged me.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.333
It was your idea?

12:30.375 --> 12:33.127
I'll be waitin' in the car,

12:30.375 --> 12:33.127
Steph. Take your time.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.550
Steph, I can't take this

12:35.754 --> 12:38.550
snooping thing anymore.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.261
You read my diary,

12:38.592 --> 12:41.261
you listen to my phone calls

12:41.302 --> 12:43.804
and now, you break

12:41.302 --> 12:43.804
into Steve's apartment.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.181
How much did you hear?

12:45.223 --> 12:47.434
Not much really,

12:45.223 --> 12:47.434
hardly anything

12:47.475 --> 12:48.976
just the you're

12:47.475 --> 12:48.976
the only one for him

12:49.018 --> 12:50.729
and he's the onliest

12:49.018 --> 12:50.729
one for you

12:52.397 --> 12:53.814
Or maybe you're

12:52.397 --> 12:53.814
the onliest one.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.234
Or is it..

12:56.276 --> 12:58.111
Will you stop it?

13:00.572 --> 13:02.907
This is the lowest thing

13:00.572 --> 13:02.907
you've ever done.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.284
I was just trying to help.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.703
Well, you wanna help?

13:04.325 --> 13:06.703
Then get out of my life.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.290
[instrumental music]

13:29.934 --> 13:31.561
Hey.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.561
Hey, what are you doing?

13:31.603 --> 13:32.729
Why are you

13:31.603 --> 13:32.729
painting those pink?

13:32.771 --> 13:34.314
I hate pink.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.858
Because, Jess, believe it

13:34.355 --> 13:37.858
or not, women use hairspray too.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.069
And check this out.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.988
I glued some foam lining

13:40.111 --> 13:41.988
around the edge

13:42.029 --> 13:44.324
of the shield

13:42.029 --> 13:44.324
for extra comfort.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.619
Yeah, good thinking.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.619
Now, we can charge extra<i> money.</i>

13:47.661 --> 13:49.120
Alright, come on, we're on the

13:47.661 --> 13:49.120
air, live in two minutes.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.038

13:49.162 --> 13:51.038

14:01.675 --> 14:03.384
Oh, Beck, I have a very

14:01.675 --> 14:03.384
special job for you.

You know, I'll show you.

Here it is, right here.

Come over here.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.554

Here's a special

I borrowed

14:09.223 --> 14:10.642

14:10.684 --> 14:12.185
Watch, watch all those little

14:10.684 --> 14:12.185

14:19.108 --> 14:21.319
I'm not familiar with this.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.822
Don't worry about it. Check

14:21.361 --> 14:23.822
this out, I made labels for you.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.323

15:57.415 --> 15:58.875
the funny thing that happened

15:57.415 --> 15:58.875
to you this morning.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.752
Out where?

16:00.794 --> 16:02.336
Out there,

16:00.794 --> 16:02.336
out there in TV land

16:02.378 --> 16:03.797
you know,

16:02.378 --> 16:03.797
for the millions of people.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.760
Millions, that's

16:05.506 --> 16:08.760
a lot, right?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.344
Yeah, yeah, and they're all

16:08.802 --> 16:10.344
out there and they want to hear

16:10.386 --> 16:12.138
the funny thing that happened

16:10.386 --> 16:12.138
to you this morning.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.264
Shoot.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.183
I forgot.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.727
No, no, you know,

16:16.225 --> 16:17.727
what it is

16:17.769 --> 16:19.395
her mind is still

16:17.769 --> 16:19.395
reeling in amazement

16:19.437 --> 16:21.105
after having witnessed

16:19.437 --> 16:21.105
in action

16:21.147 --> 16:22.857
the Spray Guard

16:21.147 --> 16:22.857
2000..

16:22.899 --> 16:23.942
And 1.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.110
I got<i> that</i> right.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.487
Yes, you did.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.487
Bye-Bye, Michelle.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.613

- Good to see you.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.989
Thank you, Michelle.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.616
Where's all that clapping

16:30.030 --> 16:31.616
coming from?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.451
Run along, child.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.745
'Okay, and now

16:33.493 --> 16:35.745
to help explain'

16:35.787 --> 16:38.998
how the Spray Guard 2000 and 1

16:35.787 --> 16:38.998
works, I'd like to bring out

16:39.039 --> 16:40.583
our head of research

16:39.039 --> 16:40.583
and development.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.335
Ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you, Jesse

16:53.387 --> 16:55.974

16:56.015 --> 16:59.310
After years of painstaking

16:56.015 --> 16:59.310
research and development

16:59.352 --> 17:03.523
we've proven

16:59.352 --> 17:03.523
that the Spray Guard 2000 and 1

17:03.564 --> 17:06.192
protects the frontal

17:03.564 --> 17:06.192
cranial region

17:06.233 --> 17:07.986
from the damaging effects

17:08.027 --> 17:10.488
of airborne haircare

17:08.027 --> 17:10.488
products.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.785
Doctor, could you please explain

17:12.406 --> 17:15.785
that in layman's terms?

17:15.827 --> 17:18.037
Well, Danny,

17:15.827 --> 17:18.037
in layman's terms..

17:24.919 --> 17:26.963
See, take

17:24.919 --> 17:26.963
a look at this.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.841
Nothing gets through.

[canned clapping]

17:32.802 --> 17:34.762
Now, uh, doctor,

17:32.802 --> 17:34.762
if you will hand over

17:34.804 --> 17:37.390
the Spray Guard 2000 and 1,

17:34.804 --> 17:37.390
I will show the people

17:37.431 --> 17:40.267
how easy it is to use in their

17:37.431 --> 17:40.267
very own homes, doctor.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.644
Certainly, Jesse.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.237
Ow! Ow! Ow!

17:48.651 --> 17:51.237
It's glued to my head.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.780
It's stuck.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.780
Somebody help me.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.282
Uh, uh, Becky, Becky!

17:59.829 --> 18:01.539
You're needed in

18:10.339 --> 18:11.758
Where are all

18:10.339 --> 18:11.758

18:17.972 --> 18:19.682
if you'll, if you'll

18:19.724 --> 18:22.060
give me the hairspray, I will

18:19.724 --> 18:22.060
demonstrate the proper use

18:22.101 --> 18:24.228
of the Spray Guard 2000 And 1.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.522
Uh, just a sec, boss.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.941
It's getting a little

18:26.564 --> 18:27.941
foggy in here.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.359
Joey!

18:30.401 --> 18:31.527
Give me

18:30.401 --> 18:31.527

18:42.789 --> 18:45.124
Uh-oh, here's the hairspray.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.793
I must have given Jesse the..

18:47.919 --> 18:50.212
You see how easy

18:47.919 --> 18:50.212
it works.

18:54.926 --> 18:57.219
Uh, Jess.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.721
What is it?

18:58.763 --> 19:01.099
Uh, you missed

18:58.763 --> 19:01.099

Oh, thank you.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.457
You know, there are

20:49.207 --> 20:50.457
plenty of other

20:50.499 --> 20:51.667
people living

20:50.499 --> 20:51.667
in this house.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.377
Try torturing them

20:51.709 --> 20:53.377
for a change.

20:54.837 --> 20:58.049
I wasn't<i> trying</i>

20:54.837 --> 20:58.049
to torture you.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.467
It was just

20:58.091 --> 21:00.467
an unfortunate side effect.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.262
Steph, you can't

21:00.509 --> 21:03.262
joke your way out of this.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.098
I was just trying

21:03.303 --> 21:05.098
to protect you.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.100
Well, you don't need

21:05.139 --> 21:07.100
to protect me.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.726
But you're my sister.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.229
You know, you're a pain

21:08.768 --> 21:11.229
in the neck. I'm sick of it.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.897
Okay, fine.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.149
Maybe this time, I messed up,

21:12.939 --> 21:15.149
but someday you'll need me

21:15.191 --> 21:16.525
but I won't be there

21:16.567 --> 21:18.611
'cause you want me

21:16.567 --> 21:18.611
out of your life forever!

21:24.200 --> 21:25.325
Steph!

21:29.247 --> 21:31.373
I was hoping

21:29.247 --> 21:31.373
you'd miss me.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.043
Steph, I don't want you

21:31.415 --> 21:34.043
out of my life.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.419
You don't?

21:37.046 --> 21:38.380
No.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.759
I want you out

21:39.548 --> 21:41.759
of my private life

21:41.801 --> 21:44.220
my diaries,

21:41.801 --> 21:44.220
my phone calls

21:44.262 --> 21:45.930
Steve's apartment.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.473
All the good stuff, huh?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.726
No, Steph, if you

21:48.641 --> 21:50.726
thought that Steve

21:50.768 --> 21:53.395
was seeing somebody else,

21:50.768 --> 21:53.395
why didn't you just tell me?

21:54.855 --> 21:58.192
Well, I didn't wanna put

21:54.855 --> 21:58.192
you through all that pain

21:58.234 --> 21:59.610
unless I was sure.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.948
When something hurts you,

22:01.070 --> 22:03.948
hurts me, too.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.120
Well, I guess you were

22:07.118 --> 22:09.120
in a pretty tough spot.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.455
Yeah.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.874
Do you forgive me?

22:15.417 --> 22:17.586
Yes. Come here,

22:15.417 --> 22:17.586
you knucklehead.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.800
Deej,

22:21.423 --> 22:22.800
I'm really sorry.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.844
I just didn't know

22:22.842 --> 22:24.844
what to do?

22:24.885 --> 22:26.428
Well, Steph, if you

22:24.885 --> 22:26.428
ever have a problem

22:26.470 --> 22:28.722
just come and talk

22:26.470 --> 22:28.722
to me or Steve

22:28.764 --> 22:30.641
or dad or Comet.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.143
Anybody but Kimmy.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.855
Yeah, I'll try to remember

22:33.769 --> 22:35.855
that next time

22:35.896 --> 22:38.816
and from now on,

22:35.896 --> 22:38.816
I promise, no more snooping.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.617
Oh, hi.

22:48.659 --> 22:53.039
Michelle, how dare you listen in

22:48.659 --> 22:53.039
on our private conversation.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.790
Where does she learn

22:53.080 --> 22:54.790
this stuff?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.376
Oh, popcorn.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.719
Hey, you. How much

23:04.258 --> 23:06.719
did you hear?

23:06.760 --> 23:08.012
What were you

23:06.760 --> 23:08.012
listening for?

23:08.054 --> 23:09.387
I don't know.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.019
