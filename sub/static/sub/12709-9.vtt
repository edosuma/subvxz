00:01.234 --> 00:03.237
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.270 --> 00:05.639
You're just scared.
JOHNATHAN: Of course I'm scared.

00:05.673 --> 00:09.076
Last time we were here,
33.3% of us were flayed alive.

00:09.109 --> 00:13.180
-Nice job.
-Do you have any idea how hard
it's been to act this cool?

00:13.214 --> 00:15.349
That death thing was
all part of the master plan.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.454
If Jonathan pulls off
his end of the bargain,
we'll both become gods.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.199
-DAWN: I saw Mom.
-Things are coming, Dawn.

00:31.231 --> 00:35.503
-Why are you--
-When it's bad,
Buffy won't choose you.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.271
-It wasn't her.
-What?

00:38.305 --> 00:42.509
It's the big bad, Dawn.
The one we knew was coming.

00:42.542 --> 00:46.414
What the hell happened?
This big evil that's been
promising to devour us?

00:46.447 --> 00:49.883
-Well, I think
it started chomping.
-Oh, God.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.420
Buffy, this thing knows us.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.189
It made us think
that we were talking
to people we knew.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.192
I'm just a guy
with his ear to the ground,
but even I can feel it.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.094
Something's coming.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.530
I don't know what exactly,
 but something's brewing.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.864
And it's so big,
 ugly and damned,
 it makes you and me

01:04.897 --> 01:07.067
look like little bitty
 puzzle pieces.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.368
(roars)

01:08.402 --> 01:11.105
Buffy, he's been feeding
on human blood.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.206
That's gotta do stuff.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.242
I think there was
something there,

01:14.275 --> 01:16.477
talking to him,
making him do things.

01:16.510 --> 01:20.313
* How could you use
a poor maiden-- *

01:20.347 --> 01:21.748
Spike!

01:21.781 --> 01:23.850
(roaring)

01:26.519 --> 01:28.555
I remember.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.424
I've killed,
and I can feel 'em.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.462
I can feel
every one of them.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.031
There's something
playing with us.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.468
Why is it doing this to me?

01:41.502 --> 01:43.003
I don't know.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.173
Help me.
I'll help you.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.674
This thing has been
closer to Spike
than any of us.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.277
And if you want
to understand it--

01:50.311 --> 01:52.813
I'm gonna have to
get close to Spike.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.649
Robson, are you here?

01:57.484 --> 01:58.885
Robson!

02:02.489 --> 02:04.992
-Dear God, I thought you were--
-Gather them.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.795
-What?
-It's started.

02:08.728 --> 02:10.798
It's all right.
I understand.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.865
I'll take--

02:13.667 --> 02:15.936
So, the basement
was filled with bodies?

02:15.968 --> 02:17.037
Apparently.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.841
And Spike could have
sired countless others

02:21.875 --> 02:23.676
and buried them around town.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.549
And we're waiting for him
to do what exactly?
Do something crazy?

02:28.581 --> 02:30.550
(sighs)
It's not that simple.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.653
Shouldn't we stab him
through the chest?

02:33.687 --> 02:36.289
I mean, isn't that what we do
when these things happen?

02:36.324 --> 02:38.891
Look, Buffy knows
what she's doing.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.228
Well, Xander, you know what
we're all talking about.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.131
I mean,
 you've always been part of
 the "Spike is evil" faction.

02:44.163 --> 02:46.866
I've got a house
to put back together.

02:46.900 --> 02:50.471
Fine. You guys keep
your heads buried in the sand.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.372
But I think we should
all prepare ourselves
for the possibility

02:52.406 --> 02:54.675
that William the Bloody
is back.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.854
All right.
Lookin' good.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.756
How do you feel?
Good.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.758
Excellent.
We've got work to do.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.360
Do we have
to do work right now?

03:12.393 --> 03:15.263
Can't I just walk around
for a while in my coat?

03:15.295 --> 03:18.566
Don't go soft on me now.
We're right in the trench,

03:18.598 --> 03:21.001
and the exhaust port's
in sight.

03:21.033 --> 03:22.870
I thought that was it.
I did what you told me.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.905
It's not my fault
it didn't work.

03:24.937 --> 03:27.206
And why do I have to do
all the wet work?

03:27.240 --> 03:30.210
Hey! You know the rules.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.579
I can't take
corporeal form.

03:32.612 --> 03:33.646
Feel.

03:34.814 --> 03:35.748
Mm-hmm.

03:38.085 --> 03:40.920
Cool.
Pretty bitchin', right?

03:40.954 --> 03:43.456
I'm like Obi-Wan.
Or Patrick Swayze.

03:44.925 --> 03:48.461
Believe me. I would do
this stuff if I could.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.396
I can't.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.466
I need you.
You're my iron fist.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.304
(sighs)
I just don't think
I can kill anybody else.

03:56.336 --> 03:59.206
Oh, will you stop
worrying about that?

03:59.239 --> 04:02.475
I didn't want to kill you.
Warren made me.
Hey, I'm glad he did.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.176
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.981
It didn't hurt too much?
I-I'm not very good at stabbing.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.050
You know,
it wasn't that bad.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.420
It was like a--
a sharp pain,
then a burning,

04:13.454 --> 04:15.823
then a general
queasiness.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.158
It was kind of like
when I used to get ulcers
in high school,

04:18.190 --> 04:20.327
only at the end,
I became one
with light and hope.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.896
I can't do it.
I-- I can't do it anymore.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.300
Hey, this isn't
your fault, okay?

04:26.334 --> 04:29.235
It's my fault
the ritual didn't work.
I screwed up.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.005
I'm little.
I don't have as much blood
as other people.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.308
I probably should have
told someone I was anemic.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.312
Don't worry.
We're gonna fix it.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.581
You gotta trust us.
We know what we're doing.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.016
I can't kill anybody else.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.519
Okay, calm down.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.355
We can work around that.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.863
We're gonna get to
the bottom of this.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.434
We just
can't take any chances.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.401
Don't.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.172
Make it tighter.
The knots will give.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.877
I get free,
someone's gonna die.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.721
(theme music playing)

06:09.702 --> 06:13.273
Now, guys, look.
We can settle this
one of two ways.

06:13.305 --> 06:16.343
You can repaint
the walls, or...

06:16.375 --> 06:18.946
I can suspend you and report
this little incident

06:18.978 --> 06:20.548
on your permanent record.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.084
Fine. Do that.

06:25.117 --> 06:26.286
Okay, I was bluffing.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.721
I hadn't really thought
that one through.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.057
Listen, this whole
permanent record thing

06:31.091 --> 06:32.692
is such a myth anyway.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.562
Colleges never ask for anything
past your S.A.T. scores,

06:35.596 --> 06:38.197
and it's not like employers
are gonna be callin' up

06:38.230 --> 06:41.735
to check to see how many days
you missed back in high school.

06:41.769 --> 06:45.105
So, listen, I--
I could suspend you,

06:45.137 --> 06:47.406
but that would mean
calling your parents,

06:47.441 --> 06:50.409
alerting your teachers,
filling out paperwork

06:50.444 --> 06:52.579
and quite possibly having
to talk to the school board.

06:52.612 --> 06:56.750
All of which sounds
positively exhausting to me.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.117
No.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.987
No, I think
it would be much easier

07:01.021 --> 07:02.422
if I just called the police.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.757
Let them deal with it.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.730
Oh, and in case
you're wondering...

07:09.762 --> 07:11.531
this is the part
where I'm not bluffing.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.035
We'll repaint it.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.069
Good job.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.639
(knocking on door)

07:20.040 --> 07:20.940
Excuse me.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.278
Miss Summers.

07:26.312 --> 07:27.980
I'm with students.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.084
I just wanted to tell you that
Buffy won't be coming in today.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.452
She's really sick.
Oh, no.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.788
Yeah. Last night
she was vomiting,

07:35.822 --> 07:38.125
and then this morning
she was vomiting some more.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.326
And then, just when
we thought she was done,

07:40.360 --> 07:42.629
she... started vomiting again.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.497
Yeah, we got that
stomach flu going around.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.968
Her exact words were,
"I've got stuff coming out
of both ends."

07:49.336 --> 07:51.271
Thank you.

07:51.303 --> 07:53.673
That's... very helpful.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.776
Sure. No problem.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.146
-Hey, guys.
How's it goin'?
-Pretty good.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.447
Uh, tell your sister
not to worry about it.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.382
We'll soldier on
without her here.

08:03.415 --> 08:06.153
Just, um, tell her
to concentrate
on getting better.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.689
Yeah, she'll be fine.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.358
She just needs to get
some stuff out of her system.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.326
I need to find him
as soon as possible.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.394
He's not answering
any of his numbers.

08:15.427 --> 08:17.697
TRAVERS:
Ms. Summers,
the Watchers Council

08:17.730 --> 08:21.735
does not keep track
of our lapsed employees.

08:21.769 --> 08:25.271
Ever since Mr. Giles pulled up
his stake in Sunnydale,

08:25.372 --> 08:28.742
we've not made it our business
to follow his every move.

08:28.776 --> 08:31.011
You don't need to get
all British and dodgy,
Mr. Travers.

08:31.043 --> 08:34.581
I know you have ways
of finding him.

08:34.615 --> 08:38.018
Well, I suppose, if you feel
the matter is urgent,
we could look into it.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.520
I'd appreciate it.
Thank you.
Not at all. Good day.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.457
The girl knows nothing.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.232
And we need to find
Rupert Giles...

08:57.269 --> 08:59.538
As soon as possible.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.441
(whimpering)

09:21.629 --> 09:22.895
Can I do something?

09:24.130 --> 09:26.133
I think you
should probably g--

09:28.836 --> 09:29.769
Here.

09:32.471 --> 09:35.408
(snarling)

09:40.748 --> 09:42.915
BUFFY:
He's been feasting
on humans for weeks.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.552
He's having some
pretty bad withdrawals.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.287
I think we need
to get him some blood.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.989
Do you want me to kill Anya?

09:50.322 --> 09:54.293
No. We should probably
try to wean him off humans.

09:54.326 --> 09:55.995
He'll have to make do
with animal blood.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.999
I'll go get some.
You don't mind?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.268
No, I have to get
out of the house.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.235
Xander's installing
the new windows,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.806
and he keeps giving
lectures on proper
tool maintenance.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.508
Tool talk-- not my thing.

10:09.809 --> 10:10.977
Thank you.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.115
How you doin' in there?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.786
He's in pretty bad shape.

10:18.818 --> 10:20.620
Past the point where he can
tell me anything.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.657
I wasn't asking about him.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.458
I'll be okay.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.794
FIRST/WARREN:
 She won't feel a thing.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.629
Just do it. Fast.

10:30.663 --> 10:34.301
Cut her deep, cut her quick.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.969
It'll be over before
she knows what hit her.

10:36.003 --> 10:39.940
What if she squeals?
Uh, better go for
her throat first.

10:39.972 --> 10:43.876
-(snorting)
 -Babe II: Pig in the City
was really underrated.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.077
Don't think about Babe.
Right.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.981
You're Conan.
You're the Destroyer.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.152
It's you against nature.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.520
You're the hunter.
You're primal.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.990
You live off the land.
You're Andrew.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.826
Everyone knows you.
You play by your own rules.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.830
It's kill or be killed!
That'll do, pig!
(yells)

11:02.863 --> 11:04.030
(pig squealing)

11:04.063 --> 11:05.932
No, you gotta--
you gotta corner it.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.601
-Stay between it
and the hall or--
-(squealing)

11:11.604 --> 11:13.072
(squealing)

11:16.710 --> 11:19.011
That's the worst attempt
at pig slaughtering
I've ever seen.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.082
(panting)
I'm not very good at stabbing.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.518
Isn't there some other way
we can get blood?

11:25.552 --> 11:27.086
Number 87.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.091
I'd like 12 pork chops...

11:34.094 --> 11:36.229
two pounds of sausage,

11:36.263 --> 11:39.198
eight quarts of pig's blood,
three steaks,

11:39.231 --> 11:41.168
um,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.235
halibut and, uh...

11:44.270 --> 11:46.206
some toothpaste.

11:47.941 --> 11:52.011
This is a butcher shop, Neo.
We don't sell toothpaste.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.780
Um--

11:53.813 --> 11:56.383
Okay. Just the other stuff then.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.217
You got it.

12:00.921 --> 12:01.889
Hi.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.258
Ooh, steak sauce.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.171
BUTCHER:
Number 88.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.313
Wait a minute!

12:28.648 --> 12:31.484
Don't kill me!
I'm not gonna kill you.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.855
Don't torture me and send me
to an eternal pain dimension.
I'm not gonna.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.490
Warren killed Tara.
I didn't do it.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.293
And he was aiming
for Buffy anyway.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.796
Not making it better.

12:42.830 --> 12:46.933
And you got your revenge.
You killed my best friend.
We're even.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.735
Even?

12:48.768 --> 12:51.138
You think I get satisfaction
from what I did?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.774
Maybe not,
but let me keep my skin, okay?

12:54.807 --> 12:57.076
I'm not bad.
I'm not bad anymore.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.979
I'm good.

12:59.011 --> 13:01.014
I do good things now.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.615
Then why do you need
lots and lots of blood?

13:05.684 --> 13:09.022
I am bad.
I'm bad. I'm evil.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.124
But I'm protected
by powerful forces.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.759
Forces you can't even

13:12.792 --> 13:15.294
begin to imagine,
little girl.

13:15.327 --> 13:19.365
If you harm me, you shall know
the wrath of he that is
darkness and terror.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.168
Your blood will boil,
and you will know
true suffering.

13:22.201 --> 13:25.437
Stand down, she-witch.
Your defeat is at hand.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.639
Shut your mouth.

13:27.639 --> 13:29.976
I am a she-witch.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.711
A very powerful she-witch.

13:32.745 --> 13:37.350
Or witch, as is more accurate.
I am not to be trifled with.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.120
But I--
I'm talking!
Don't interrupt me.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.022
Insignificant man.

13:43.355 --> 13:46.393
I am Willow.
I am death.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.729
If you dare defy me,
I will call down my fury,

13:49.761 --> 13:54.902
exact fresh vengeance
and make your worst fears
come true.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.169
Okay?

14:01.341 --> 14:02.575
Look who I found.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.544
Oh, this can't be good.

14:05.577 --> 14:08.480
Guess who was buying
mass amounts of blood
at the butcher shop?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.682
Hey, your hair's
not even black anymore.

14:10.716 --> 14:11.985
XANDER:
What are you doin'
back in town?

14:12.019 --> 14:15.355
You'll get nothin'
out of me, carpenter.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.591
We'll see about that.

14:18.625 --> 14:22.261
Careful with my coat.
It's expensive.
Is it new?

14:22.294 --> 14:23.429
Hey!

14:24.431 --> 14:25.532
Ow.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.201
Now, we can do
this the hard way,
Ow.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.269
if you want.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.172
But believe me when I tell ya,

14:32.205 --> 14:34.274
this will go much easier...

14:34.307 --> 14:39.245
if you just tell us
what you know.
Ow!

14:39.278 --> 14:41.914
You're barkin' up
the wrong asparagus, man.
I don't know anything.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.750
Here's the thing.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.251
I don't believe you.

14:46.452 --> 14:49.355
I haven't done
anything wrong.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.057
Well, then you won't mind
if we ask you a few questions.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.960
Yeah, okay.

14:52.993 --> 14:57.063
Why were you buying blood
at the butcher shop?

14:57.096 --> 14:59.099
I fell in love with
a beautiful vampire girl
down in Mexico.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.201
Now we're tryin'
to make a go of it
on the straight and narrow

15:01.234 --> 15:03.269
and put our lives back
together here in Sunnydale.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.605
You think this is
a game, junior?

15:06.639 --> 15:09.442
People are dying.
Friends' lives are in danger.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.077
(whimpers)
Hey, Anya.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.614
And now you want to waste
my time with deceptions?
Not on my watch!

15:14.647 --> 15:16.082
(groans)
Hey, Anya.

15:17.283 --> 15:18.618
Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

15:36.802 --> 15:39.105
Did you see that?

15:39.139 --> 15:41.008
I actually made him cry.
You were perfect.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.842
I was worried I overdid it
with the whole easy-way,
hard-way thing.

15:43.875 --> 15:46.980
No, you were great.
And I wasn't sure
if I should slap him,

15:47.014 --> 15:50.783
but then he made me want to,
so I thought, "Okay, slap him."
He'll be singin' in no time.

15:50.817 --> 15:54.620
So, what do we do now?
Well, now we let him stew
in his own juices for a bit,

15:54.653 --> 15:56.956
then we give him
the hard brace.
Right.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.857
ANYA:
What's the status
with your guy?

16:00.059 --> 16:02.995
He's not talking yet.
We'll get there.

16:03.029 --> 16:06.499
-How's your guy?
-The weasel wants to sing.
He just needs a tune.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.001
He's primed.
I'll be pumping him
in no time.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.804
He'll give us
information soon.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.749
Better?

16:25.652 --> 16:26.653
Good.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.721
I don't remember anything.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.527
Well, you were having
pretty bad withdrawal.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.528
No, not that.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.097
I don't remember...

16:39.698 --> 16:40.567
what I did.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.469
Nothing?

16:42.501 --> 16:44.171
Some flashes here and there.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.106
It's like I'm watching
someone else...

16:49.241 --> 16:51.744
do it-- kill people.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.681
I've been losin' time
for a while now.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.384
Wakin' up in strange places.

17:01.053 --> 17:02.389
When did your chip
stop working?

17:03.923 --> 17:05.758
Wasn't aware that it had,
you know.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.095
Not till now.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.930
And the losing time?
How long has that
been going on?

17:12.464 --> 17:15.233
Oh, things have been wonky
for me ever since I got back.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.236
Ever since...

17:17.636 --> 17:19.405
You got your soul.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.607
Figured that's
what it was like.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.108
Been so long since I had one.

17:24.742 --> 17:25.644
How did you do it?

17:26.645 --> 17:28.214
How'd you get
your soul back?

17:30.982 --> 17:32.719
Saw a man about a girl.

17:36.588 --> 17:39.226
I went to seek a legend out.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.230
Traveled to the other side
of the world, made a deal
with a demon.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.402
Just like that?
No, not just like that.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.938
There was a price.
There were trials.

17:52.939 --> 17:53.839
Torture.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.277
Pain and suffering...

17:58.411 --> 18:00.712
of sorts.
Of sorts?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.648
Well, it's all relative,
isn't it?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.951
Meaning?

18:04.983 --> 18:08.555
Meaning I have come
to redefine the words
"pain" and "suffering"

18:08.587 --> 18:10.522
since I fell in love
with you.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.127
How can you say that?

18:16.863 --> 18:19.132
Apparently I just slaughtered
half of Sunnydale, pet.

18:19.165 --> 18:22.201
I'm not really worried about
being polite anymore.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.636
So, that's what
this is about.

18:25.971 --> 18:27.006
You're feeling sorry
for yourself, Spike?

18:27.038 --> 18:29.107
I'm feelin' honest with myself.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.443
You used me.

18:32.944 --> 18:34.314
Yes.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.383
You told me that, of course.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.185
I never understood it though.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.621
Not till now.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.691
You hated yourself...

18:45.724 --> 18:47.227
and you took it out on me.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.529
You figure that out
just now?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.035
A soul's not all about moonbeams
and pennywhistles, love.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.505
It's about self-loathing.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.540
(scoffs) I get it.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.343
I had to travel
round the world, but...

19:05.345 --> 19:07.346
I understand you now.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.182
I understand
the violence inside.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.484
Violence?

19:12.519 --> 19:16.355
William the Bloody now has
insight into violence?

19:16.388 --> 19:17.656
Not the same.

19:19.526 --> 19:22.628
As bad as I was,
as evil and as wretched
as I was,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.596
I never truly
hated myself back then.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.067
Not like I do now.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.682
How's your face?

19:42.714 --> 19:43.782
Okay.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.619
Sorry about that.
She shouldn't have hit you.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.226
Okay.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.529
Thirsty? Go on.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.366
(sniffs)

20:01.733 --> 20:02.934
That chick's psycho.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.704
You don't know
the half of it.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.807
She's a vengeance demon,
you know.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.143
She's bad news.

20:12.944 --> 20:14.913
This one time, I saw her
having sex with Spike.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.419
She's killed more men
than smallpox.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.121
Does smallpox
still kill people?
She's killed a lot of men.

20:22.153 --> 20:24.757
She tortures them.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.794
Anyone who incurs her wrath.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.095
One time she...

20:30.430 --> 20:32.064
Nah, never mind.
What?

20:32.097 --> 20:34.267
It's not important.
What'd she do?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.403
Well, there was this one guy.

20:38.003 --> 20:41.240
There was this one guy.
He, uh-- He hurt her real bad.

20:41.273 --> 20:42.775
So she paid him back.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.578
She killed him.
But she did it real slow.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.549
See, first
she stopped his heart,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.884
and then she replaced it
with darkness.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.086
And then she made him
live his life like that.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.888
But he still had to...

20:56.923 --> 20:59.991
go do his job
and see his friends and...

21:00.026 --> 21:01.928
wake up in the morning
and go to bed at night.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.962
But he had to do it all...

21:03.996 --> 21:05.298
empty...

21:06.499 --> 21:08.434
without anything
to look forward to.

21:08.468 --> 21:12.238
Ever.
Sounds bad.

21:12.270 --> 21:15.607
Well, then she tore out his
intestines and rubbed it in his
face and took pictures of it.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.676
Oh, God.
But she's downstairs now.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.446
Don't worry about her.
What if--

21:20.480 --> 21:21.847
See, the thing is,

21:21.881 --> 21:24.150
we've all been
a little on edge lately.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.586
Some bad things
have been happening.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.954
And the girls,
they're all lookin' for
someone to blame.

21:28.988 --> 21:32.023
-I didn't do anything.
-ANYA: You lying
son of a bitch!

21:32.057 --> 21:34.626
You're gonna tell us what
we need to know, and you're
gonna tell us right now!

21:34.661 --> 21:36.261
-Anya, no!
-ANDREW: Stop it!

21:36.295 --> 21:40.298
Get off me, Harris!

21:41.232 --> 21:42.669
(mouthing words

21:42.701 --> 21:46.038
-Come here, you pip-squeak.
-(groans) Get her off me!

21:46.072 --> 21:48.807
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you
what you need to know!

21:48.840 --> 21:51.009
(Andrew yelling)

21:51.042 --> 21:52.010
Excuse me.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.053
Well.

22:03.556 --> 22:06.057
We've got ourselves
a problem.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.497
ANDREW:
Somebody help. Ow.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.531
Everything okay?

22:13.566 --> 22:15.034
Fine.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.036
Okay.

22:17.068 --> 22:20.539
(sighs)

22:20.573 --> 22:24.009
FIRST/SPIKE: What do I do?
Job half done. Never send
a boy to do a man's job.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.846
(chuckling)

22:26.878 --> 22:28.847
* Oh, don't deceive me

22:28.881 --> 22:31.217
* Oh, never leave me

22:40.393 --> 22:42.828
Who were you talking to?
What's that?

22:42.862 --> 22:45.397
I heard you
through the door.
Who were you talking to?

22:45.432 --> 22:48.867
Nobody. I was just, uh,
keeping myself company.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.403
Are you okay?

22:51.438 --> 22:52.404
Fine.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.741
How are you?

22:55.775 --> 22:58.109
Now, you could talk,
or I could keep hitting you.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.413
Believe me,
I'd love to keep hitting you.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.080
Spike?

23:02.114 --> 23:03.715
I'm fine, Buffy, really.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.718
I'm just...

23:06.752 --> 23:08.921
feeling a bit peckish,
I suppose.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.388
Do you mind?

23:26.005 --> 23:27.940
(growls)

23:29.476 --> 23:32.444
(groans)
(growls)

23:32.479 --> 23:34.480
We needed more blood
to activate the Seal of Dan--

23:38.651 --> 23:41.319
(screaming)

23:46.925 --> 23:48.694
(screaming)

24:10.215 --> 24:12.585
He didn't seem to want
anything to do with me.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.488
I mean, he just pushed me aside
and charged at the wall.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.690
Are you hurt?
Not-- Not really.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.660
How's what's his name?

24:20.692 --> 24:23.663
He's got a good chunk
taken out of his neck,
but he'll be all right.

24:23.695 --> 24:26.031
Had to tie him up again,
but mainly just to keep him

24:26.065 --> 24:27.634
from scratching
at his bandages.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.036
What the hell happened
up there?

24:30.068 --> 24:32.371
I don't know. I mean,

24:32.403 --> 24:34.673
Spike and I were having
a conversation,
and he was fine.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.710
I mean, you know,
fine as Spike can be.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.512
And then I went
to check on you guys,
and when I got back

24:40.547 --> 24:43.615
it was...
like he was a completely
different person.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.285
Different like
William the Bloody
type different?

24:46.317 --> 24:50.890
He was talking to someone.
I heard through the door.
He was having this conversation.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.192
And then he started singing.

24:53.224 --> 24:54.425
Maybe it's another musical.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.329
A much crappier musical.

24:58.364 --> 25:01.067
He mentioned something
about a song in the cellar.

25:01.099 --> 25:04.470
Uh, and he changed there too.
I mean, instantly became
another person.

25:04.502 --> 25:05.436
A trigger.

25:06.438 --> 25:09.576
The horse?
No. In his head.

25:09.608 --> 25:12.478
It's a trigger.
It's a brainwashing term.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.181
It's how the military makes
sleeper agents.

25:15.213 --> 25:17.549
They-- They brainwash
operatives...

25:17.584 --> 25:20.553
and condition them
with a specific trigger,

25:20.586 --> 25:25.090
like a song, that makes them
drastically change
at a moment's notice.

25:25.124 --> 25:28.227
Is this left over
from your days in the army?

25:28.259 --> 25:30.896
No, this is left over from
every army movie I've ever seen.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.765
But it makes sense.

25:32.798 --> 25:35.233
We've had ghosts or something
haunting us, right?

25:35.267 --> 25:40.271
Well, what if Spike's ghosts
have figured out a way
to not only haunt him,

25:40.306 --> 25:42.909
what if they've
figured out how to--
how to control him?

25:42.942 --> 25:46.444
Spike said he's been
seeing things since
I found him in the basement.

25:46.478 --> 25:49.015
So, he gets
his soul back,

25:49.048 --> 25:50.583
he starts seeing
spooky things,

25:50.616 --> 25:52.919
and he goes
extra, extra crazy.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.121
This trigger, how do we...

25:55.153 --> 25:57.222
holster, safety, or--

25:57.256 --> 26:00.192
I don't know guns.
How do we make it stop?

26:00.226 --> 26:02.560
Well, usually the operative
completes his task

26:02.595 --> 26:06.097
and either
blows his head off
or steals a submarine.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.867
All right.
I need information.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.971
If Spike's a bomb,
then I need to know
how to diffuse him. You two,

26:12.003 --> 26:15.907
I want to know what did this
to him-- spirits, ghosts,
demons. Check the lot of them.

26:15.942 --> 26:19.077
Look for anything that
could haunt or-- or possibly
control like this.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.647
I need to know exactly
what we're dealing with.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.086
(footsteps approaching)

28:34.814 --> 28:36.714
Did I hurt anybody?

28:37.916 --> 28:40.286
You took a good bite
out of Andrew.

28:41.319 --> 28:42.954
Who?

28:42.989 --> 28:44.155
Tucker's brother.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.326
Oh.
He'll be okay.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.097
I don't remember.

28:53.965 --> 28:54.933
It's okay.

28:58.269 --> 29:00.439
Buffy, I don't know why.

29:00.471 --> 29:02.307
(sighs)
We think we do.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.576
Something's playing you.

29:05.611 --> 29:09.949
Some ghost or demon
has figured out
how to control you.

29:09.981 --> 29:12.250
I've got the gang
researching it right now.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.688
Xander has this theory
that you're being triggered.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.758
Kill me.

29:21.626 --> 29:24.997
-What?
-Buffy, you have to kill me.

29:26.031 --> 29:28.567
You don't understand.

29:28.599 --> 29:30.336
When I left the room earlier,
I heard you talking to someone.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.371
Do you have any idea
what I'm capable of?

29:37.276 --> 29:40.145
I was in the cellar with you.
I saw what you did.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.248
I'm not talking about
the cellar.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.150
The people in the cellar
got off easy.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.984
I'm talking about me.

29:48.319 --> 29:51.824
Buffy, you've never met
the real me.

29:53.724 --> 29:56.694
Believe me, I'm well aware
of what you're capable of.
No.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.030
You got off easy too.

30:04.903 --> 30:08.007
Do you know how much blood
you can drink from a girl
before she'll die?

30:08.039 --> 30:10.142
I do.

30:10.175 --> 30:13.011
You see, the trick is
to drink just enough

30:14.180 --> 30:17.782
to know how to damage them
just enough

30:17.816 --> 30:20.451
so that they'll still cry

30:20.486 --> 30:21.386
when you...

30:23.521 --> 30:26.192
'Cause it's not worth it
if they don't cry.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.728
-It's not your fault.
-(scoffs)

30:29.760 --> 30:33.699
-You're not the one doing this.
-I already did it.
It's already done.

30:36.567 --> 30:39.238
You want to know what I've done
to girls Dawn's age?

30:42.740 --> 30:44.410
This is me, Buffy.

30:45.576 --> 30:47.613
You've gotta kill me
before I get out.

30:49.780 --> 30:53.719
We can keep you locked up.
We'll keep you here,
and we'll figure out--

30:53.751 --> 30:57.256
Have you ever really
asked yourself
why you can't do it-- off me?

30:57.288 --> 31:00.526
After everything
I've done to you,
to people around you?

31:02.361 --> 31:05.396
It's not love.
We both know that.

31:05.431 --> 31:09.067
You fought by my side.
You've saved lives,
you've helped--

31:09.101 --> 31:10.469
Don't do that.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.740
Don't rationalize this
into some noble act.

31:17.242 --> 31:18.809
'Cause we both know
the truth of it.

31:24.782 --> 31:26.417
You like men who hurt you.

31:27.452 --> 31:28.386
No.

31:30.788 --> 31:33.259
You need the pain we cause you.

31:33.291 --> 31:34.859
You need the hate.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.796
You need it to do your job--
to be the Slayer.

31:37.828 --> 31:38.829
No.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.401
I don't hate like that.

31:44.635 --> 31:45.938
Not you...

31:45.971 --> 31:47.405
or myself.

31:49.508 --> 31:50.808
Not anymore.

31:52.177 --> 31:53.945
You think you have
insight now...

31:53.980 --> 31:56.248
because your soul's
drenched in blood?

31:57.282 --> 31:58.616
You don't know me.

32:00.451 --> 32:02.653
You don't even know you.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.624
Was that you who killed
those people in the cellar?

32:05.656 --> 32:08.227
Was that you who waited
for those girls?

32:08.259 --> 32:10.862
-There's no one else.
-That's not true.

32:12.631 --> 32:13.632
Listen to me.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.369
You're not alive
because of hate or pain.

32:20.138 --> 32:21.973
You're alive because
I saw you change.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.076
Because I saw your penance.

32:25.111 --> 32:28.180
Window dressing.

32:28.213 --> 32:31.017
Be easier, wouldn't it?
If it were an act.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.550
But it's not.

32:34.685 --> 32:38.356
You faced the monster
inside of you,
and you fought back.

32:39.857 --> 32:42.094
You risked everything
to be a better man.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.730
Buffy--
And you can be.

32:46.164 --> 32:47.499
You are.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.335
You may not see it,

32:50.368 --> 32:51.670
but I do.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.140
I do.

32:55.874 --> 32:58.376
I believe in you, Spike.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.655
(screaming)

33:58.804 --> 34:01.640
(both grunting)

34:11.083 --> 34:12.251
(yells)

34:50.088 --> 34:51.222
(yells)

34:51.257 --> 34:53.159
(groaning)

34:53.192 --> 34:55.460
(grunting)

35:21.320 --> 35:24.456
(yelling)

35:28.893 --> 35:30.228
(groaning)

35:34.833 --> 35:36.802
XANDER: Buffy.
Dawn.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.603
She's okay.
(panting)

35:38.637 --> 35:41.840
Is this it?
I thought there was more of 'em.
Spike.

36:00.226 --> 36:03.295
They were so fast.

36:03.329 --> 36:06.931
And organized.
They were after Spike all along.

36:08.199 --> 36:09.668
And we were just
in the way.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.775
I know these guys.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.246
I fought them before.

36:23.449 --> 36:24.750
We aren't being haunted.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.085
This isn't some demon.

36:28.219 --> 36:30.188
It's all the same thing.

36:30.222 --> 36:34.693
Spike's ghosts,
the people that you guys saw.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.362
"From beneath us."

36:37.463 --> 36:38.864
It's all the same thing.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.101
I know what we're up against.

36:44.802 --> 36:46.103
The First.

36:52.878 --> 36:56.382
MAN:
They took our files,
wiped out our records.

36:56.414 --> 37:00.552
We've lost contact
with operations in Munich,
Switzerland, and Rome.

37:00.585 --> 37:03.889
And we've got casualty
confirmations coming in
from as far away as Melbourne.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.893
Sir...
we are crippled.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.230
It's all right, Lydia.

37:13.431 --> 37:15.501
We are still masters
of our fate.

37:16.967 --> 37:19.670
We're still captains
of our souls.

37:23.007 --> 37:23.974
Yes, sir.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.114
Ladies and gentlemen...

37:31.650 --> 37:34.320
our fears have been confirmed.

37:34.353 --> 37:38.590
The First Evil has declared
all-out war on this institution.

37:40.291 --> 37:43.661
Their first volleys
 proved most effective.

37:45.195 --> 37:46.632
I, for one,

37:46.664 --> 37:49.134
think it's time
we struck back.

37:51.369 --> 37:55.306
Get me confirmations
on all remaining operatives.

37:56.273 --> 37:58.809
Visuals and tacticals.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.079
Highest alert.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.447
Get them here
as soon as possible.

38:03.449 --> 38:06.150
Begin preparations
for mobilization.

38:06.184 --> 38:09.521
Once we're accounted for,
I want to be ready to move.

38:09.554 --> 38:10.822
Sir?

38:10.856 --> 38:12.958
We'll be paying a visit
to the Hellmouth.

38:14.793 --> 38:15.693
My friends...

38:16.695 --> 38:19.364
these are the times
that define us.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.166
Proverbs 24:6.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.869
"For by wise counsel...

38:25.836 --> 38:27.137
you shall make your war."

38:44.690 --> 38:46.391
FIRST/SPIKE:
You'll have to excuse
the spectacle...

38:48.025 --> 38:50.061
but I've always been
a bit of a sucker
for the old classics.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.074
(knife slices)
(groans)

39:04.576 --> 39:05.744
Oh!

39:10.681 --> 39:13.150
Oh, don't look at me that way.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.653
I wanted to do this
more subtle-like.

39:15.686 --> 39:19.224
My harbingers have a tendency
to call attention to themselves.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.793
(screams)

39:26.297 --> 39:29.568
You're the one who couldn't hold
his end of the bargain.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.003
You're the one who couldn't
take care of what's his name.

39:32.036 --> 39:35.740
You're the one who had to make
breakthroughs and learn
something about himself.

39:35.773 --> 39:36.942
Oh!

39:38.309 --> 39:40.945
And so now, fittingly...

39:42.280 --> 39:43.981
you're the one
who gets to do the honors.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.420
I have to admit-- I'm glad
it worked out this way.

39:48.454 --> 39:50.621
I was going to
bleed Andrew, but...

39:50.655 --> 39:52.958
you look a lot better
with your shirt off.

39:59.264 --> 40:03.068
To be honest, I'm getting
a little tired of subtle.

40:07.572 --> 40:11.577
I think it's about time
we brought some authority
to our presence.

40:11.610 --> 40:15.413
Now, Spike, you want to see
what a real vampire looks like?

40:16.947 --> 40:18.849
(men chanting in Latin)

40:46.277 --> 40:49.280
(growling)

41:05.063 --> 41:08.833
(roars)

41:38.896 --> 41:41.331
Grr! Arrgh!
