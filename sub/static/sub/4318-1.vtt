00:39.789 --> 00:42.124
When I was lying there in the VA hospital,

00:42.167 --> 00:45.127
with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,

00:45.920 --> 00:48.422
I started having these dreams of flying.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.258
I was free.

00:54.471 --> 00:58.057
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.778
They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,

01:10.820 --> 01:13.614
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.826
A VA check and 12 bucks
will get you a cup of coffee.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.662
I'm what they call... waitlisted.

01:29.714 --> 01:34.218
The Bengal Tiger, extinct for over
a century is making a comeback.

01:34.302 --> 01:38.555
These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
are the latest of a number of species

01:38.640 --> 01:42.476
that have been cloned back
into existence in the past five years.

01:42.519 --> 01:47.773
I became a marine for the hardship.
To be hammered on the anvil of life.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.486
I told myself I can pass
any test a man can pass.

01:55.365 --> 02:00.828
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

02:04.332 --> 02:06.667
Let's get it straight, upfront.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.168
I don't want your pity.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.422
You want a fair deal,
you're on the wrong planet.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.846
The strong prey on the weak.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.265
That's just the way things are.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.643
And nobody does a damn thing.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.163
Get off! Get off of him!

02:44.831 --> 02:49.418
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life
was a single thing worth fighting for.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.602
I hope you realized you just lost
yourself a customer.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.355
Candy-ass bitch.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.735
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.792
- It doesn't look like him.
- It's him.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.128
You Jake Sully?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.464
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.507
It's about your brother.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.767
We're looking for Sully, T.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.770
In there.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.462
Jesus, Tommy.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.673
The strong prey on the weak.

04:18.548 --> 04:20.926
A guy with a knife took all
Tommy would ever be

04:21.803 --> 04:23.595
for the paper in his wallet.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.766
The concern of the suits was touching.

04:27.850 --> 04:31.353
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.897
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

04:33.982 --> 04:38.443
And since your genome is identical
to his, you could step into his shoes,

04:39.654 --> 04:41.029
so to speak.

04:41.864 --> 04:44.741
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.704
You could do something important.
You can make a difference.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.877
And the pay is good.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.504
Very good.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.632
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.719
He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space

05:03.761 --> 05:05.095
to find the answers.

05:10.059 --> 05:13.895
Me, I was just another dumb grunt getting
sent someplace he was gonna regret.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.846
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.058
It doesn't feel like six years.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.436
More like a fifth of tequila
and an ass-kicking.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.117
Are we there yet?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.453
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.372
We're there.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.626
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.504
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

06:20.588 --> 06:25.675
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks
provided for your convenience.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.970
The staff thanks you in advance.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.653
Up ahead was Pandora.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.991
You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.763
Valkyrie 1-6, copy...

07:11.973 --> 07:15.600
Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear
for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

07:15.893 --> 07:20.188
Copy, Venture Star. Go for
de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.669
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

07:42.712 --> 07:44.087
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

07:44.172 --> 07:47.883
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

07:47.925 --> 07:51.261
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.724
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.601
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.395
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

08:42.438 --> 08:45.941
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

08:45.983 --> 08:49.986
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

08:50.071 --> 08:52.614
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

08:59.121 --> 09:02.999
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

09:13.135 --> 09:15.178
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.266
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.821
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

09:32.905 --> 09:34.656
Well, well, ladies.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.826
Look at all this fresh meat!

09:43.708 --> 09:47.836
Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

09:47.920 --> 09:49.462
fighting for freedom.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.679
Look out, hot rod!

09:59.098 --> 10:01.016
But out here they're just hired guns,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.977
taking the money,
working for the company.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.437
Check this out, man.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.522
Meals on wheels.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.735
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.695
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

10:13.738 --> 10:15.322
Got it! Need them!

10:24.582 --> 10:26.875
You're not in Kansas anymore.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.214
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

10:33.299 --> 10:37.052
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.930
If there is a hell,

10:41.682 --> 10:46.311
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.314
Out there, beyond that fence,

10:49.398 --> 10:53.735
every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

10:53.819 --> 10:56.988
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

10:58.866 --> 11:03.703
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.081
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

11:06.165 --> 11:09.000
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

11:09.001 --> 11:13.380
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.840
They are very hard to kill.

11:17.301 --> 11:21.304
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.016
I will not succeed.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.603
Not with all of you.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.731
If you wish to survive,

11:31.816 --> 11:34.692
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.695
You've got to obey the rules.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.490
Pandora rules.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.451
Rule number one...

11:43.536 --> 11:45.245
There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief

11:45.246 --> 11:46.996
to put your mind at ease.

11:49.333 --> 11:54.879
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.799
Wow! You look just like him.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.636
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.721
Into the bio-lab.

12:04.432 --> 12:08.977
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.311
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.997
Link... Here's the link room right here.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.357
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.278
Me and Norm are here to drive

12:18.279 --> 12:21.489
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars.

12:21.574 --> 12:26.578
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.621
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.082
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.961
Damn! They got big.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.589
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.008
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.968
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.970
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

12:43.971 --> 12:45.930
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.807
There's yours.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.144
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.063
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.464
Looks like him.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.550
No, it looks like you.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.595
This is your avatar now, Jake.

13:28.849 --> 13:33.228
And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,

13:34.313 --> 13:36.105
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

13:37.483 --> 13:38.942
or something.

13:40.277 --> 13:44.697
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

13:45.741 --> 13:47.617
which is insanely expensive.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.829
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

13:51.914 --> 13:54.082
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.209
You know, what we see, what we feel.

13:56.293 --> 13:59.003
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.548
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.384
All right. Whatever.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.012
So...

14:09.056 --> 14:10.515
Well, here I am,

14:12.184 --> 14:13.685
doing science.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.437
They're coming out!

14:16.522 --> 14:19.023
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.699
Oh, God.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.369
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

14:31.370 --> 14:37.750
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

14:38.877 --> 14:42.297
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.882
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

14:44.967 --> 14:47.760
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.054
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.432
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.227
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

14:57.980 --> 15:01.691
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.986
May the All Mother...

15:04.987 --> 15:07.196
smile upon our first meeting.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.408
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.870
I studied for five years...

15:13.871 --> 15:15.955
but there is much to learn.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.667
- Grace? This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.

15:20.210 --> 15:24.255
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.967
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.469
He's dead.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.513
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.934
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.522
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

15:41.607 --> 15:43.983
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.318
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

15:45.319 --> 15:47.945
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!

15:48.030 --> 15:49.447
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

15:49.531 --> 15:52.408
He has no business
sticking his nose in my department.

15:53.452 --> 15:57.246
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

16:05.547 --> 16:09.509
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.387
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.477
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.646
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.649
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

16:27.528 --> 16:31.823
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

16:31.824 --> 16:34.867
but now I see
that you're intentionally screwing me.

16:34.868 --> 16:38.454
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.337
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.005
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.674
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.718
How is this in any way lucky?

16:51.802 --> 16:53.553
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

16:53.637 --> 16:56.556
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.558
A Marine we can use.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.560
I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

17:00.561 --> 17:04.021
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

17:04.106 --> 17:06.065
Look, look,
you're supposed to be winning the hearts

17:06.066 --> 17:07.191
and the minds of the natives.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.068
Isn't that the whole point of
your little puppet show?

17:09.153 --> 17:10.694
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

17:10.695 --> 17:12.405
then they'll start trusting us.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.531
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

17:14.532 --> 17:16.576
but after, what, how many years?

17:16.660 --> 17:18.243
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

17:18.244 --> 17:21.580
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.708
Right. Come here.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.544
I can't... I can't...

17:29.798 --> 17:32.759
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.928
Because this little gray rock sells
for 20 million a kilo.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.223
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.225
It's what pays for your science.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.772
Now, those savages
are threatening our whole operation,

17:45.773 --> 17:47.106
we're on the brink of war,

17:47.107 --> 17:50.401
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.946
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.418
So, how much link time have you logged?

18:07.419 --> 18:11.130
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.

18:11.131 --> 18:15.510
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

18:15.594 --> 18:18.262
Zip. But I read a manual.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.265
Tell me you're joking.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.976
This is cool.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.853
Let's go.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.484
Don't. I got this.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.491
So you just figured you'd come out here,

18:38.492 --> 18:41.118
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

18:41.203 --> 18:44.956
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.375
What was going through your head?

18:47.459 --> 18:50.294
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.673
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

18:54.132 --> 18:58.427
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.307
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.977
That shouldn't be hard for you.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.812
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

19:07.896 --> 19:09.355
Initiate link.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.692
Run sequence unit three. Go.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.151
Launching.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.075
I have the first congruency.

19:29.501 --> 19:35.047
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
- Go figure.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.049
Phase-lock 40%.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.597
All right. Going in.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.807
I'm going in in four.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.479
Phase-lock 99%. Link is stable.

20:05.329 --> 20:11.250
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

20:11.251 --> 20:12.877
Pupillary reflex is good.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.674
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

20:19.384 --> 20:20.760
Hey, guys.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.429
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.889
Good!

20:24.890 --> 20:26.390
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.601
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.061
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.729
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.981
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,

20:34.066 --> 20:35.399
- that's fine.
- Okay, good. Just take it

20:35.400 --> 20:38.402
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.226
Are you feeling lightheaded
or dizzy at all?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.989
You're wiggling your toes!

20:42.074 --> 20:43.824
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.412
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.165
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

20:52.501 --> 20:53.822
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.128
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

20:56.213 --> 20:58.798
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

20:58.799 --> 21:00.967
- so take it easy.
- Wait.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.468
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.929
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

21:05.597 --> 21:07.317
- I need you to sit down. Jake!
- It's okay.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.141
- Buddy, listen to me.
- It's all good. I got this.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.937
- Jake, you need to sit down right now.
- Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.147
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.984
You need time to adjust to the avatar...
Whoa! Jake!

21:18.068 --> 21:20.319
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

21:20.404 --> 21:24.490
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand
milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

21:24.574 --> 21:26.867
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

21:26.952 --> 21:27.952
By the numbers.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.516
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.122
You're not used to your avatar body.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.957
- This is dangerous.
- This is great.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.252
- Jake? Jake, listen to me.
- Come on. They're gonna put you out.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.465
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.134
God damn it! Bring them home!

21:43.218 --> 21:45.886
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

21:47.639 --> 21:51.475
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

21:51.560 --> 21:53.161
I don't even have to play defense on it.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.729
Hey, guys. Hey.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.148
- It's okay, I'll get him.
- Jake, you have to come back!

21:57.149 --> 21:58.983
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.154
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

22:03.238 --> 22:04.655
Come on!

22:05.782 --> 22:08.659
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

22:18.170 --> 22:20.588
- Jeez! Sorry.
- Watch it!

22:42.861 --> 22:44.361
Hey, Marine!

22:45.197 --> 22:46.614
Damn.

22:48.658 --> 22:51.827
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.580
Think fast.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.583
Motor control's looking good.

23:07.469 --> 23:11.806
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.058
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.559
Hey, hey, hey!

23:16.061 --> 23:18.270
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.897
That's kind of freaky.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.399
Come on. Scat.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.735
Good night.

23:26.446 --> 23:29.573
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

23:53.598 --> 23:54.640
Welcome back.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.942
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

24:06.653 --> 24:11.949
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.160
Hold on a second.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.621
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

24:18.039 --> 24:22.168
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

24:22.878 --> 24:24.837
Vine strike's still loose.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.173
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.549
Watch it!

24:29.176 --> 24:31.897
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.679
Or the biggest.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.515
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.434
I thought you'd never ask.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.938
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.035
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

24:56.119 --> 24:58.746
This low gravity'll make you soft.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.707
You get soft,

25:04.961 --> 25:08.255
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.884
I pulled your record, Corporal.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.386
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.682
Nothing like this here, though.

25:20.936 --> 25:24.355
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.273
I figured it's just another hellhole.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.776
I was First Recon myself.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.071
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.950
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.493
I come out here?

25:38.286 --> 25:41.538
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail louie?

25:41.623 --> 25:46.210
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

25:46.878 --> 25:51.966
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.885
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

25:56.888 --> 26:02.810
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

26:02.894 --> 26:09.900
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.568
- Clear!
- Clear!

26:16.741 --> 26:21.954
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.622
Give me the goose bumps.

26:23.707 --> 26:27.126
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

26:27.210 --> 26:28.919
right on the ground.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.131
Right in the hostiles' camp.

26:32.924 --> 26:38.262
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.097
I want you to gain their trust.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.932
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

26:41.933 --> 26:44.476
or hammer them hard if they won't.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.272
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

26:48.273 --> 26:52.443
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

26:53.945 --> 26:55.529
but you report to me.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.741
Can you do that for me, son?

27:00.285 --> 27:01.660
Hell, yeah, sir.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.371
Well, all right, then.

27:15.383 --> 27:18.344
Son, I take care of my own.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.470
You get me what I need,

27:19.554 --> 27:22.806
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.184
Your real legs.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.980
That sounds real good, sir.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.323
- Link's ready!
- Phase-lock 40%.

27:39.949 --> 27:43.035
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

27:43.119 --> 27:46.663
I have five congruencies. Phase-lock 90%.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.082
Link three ready.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.417
All right, I'm going in.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.576
Sturmbeest herd
coming up on your right.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.453
Got it! Thanks.

28:27.455 --> 28:31.041
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows
and some juveniles.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.508
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

29:24.971 --> 29:28.765
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

29:31.394 --> 29:35.397
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.485
You the man, Doc.

30:16.064 --> 30:19.191
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

30:22.070 --> 30:25.239
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.413
So, how will they know we're here?

30:33.456 --> 30:36.166
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.256
This was our school.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.592
Now it's just... storage.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.345
The kids were so bright.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.264
Eager to learn.

30:50.431 --> 30:52.849
They picked up English
faster than I could teach it.

30:54.310 --> 30:57.271
So, we'll take a couple of
these Ph monitors...

30:57.563 --> 30:59.481
and a soil probe.

31:00.149 --> 31:05.028
That little yellow case back there.
The old microscope.

31:06.072 --> 31:07.155
Here.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.824
Oh, yeah. I love this one.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.034
The stingbats knocked them down.

31:19.127 --> 31:22.337
I keep hoping someone will
come back in and read them.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.131
Why don't they come back?

31:26.050 --> 31:32.222
The Omaticaya... learned as much
about us as they needed to.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.562
What happened here?

31:42.525 --> 31:45.527
Are you going to help us with this gear?
We've got a lot to do.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.085
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

32:04.505 --> 32:08.091
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

32:10.511 --> 32:13.680
Wow! It's that fast?

32:15.933 --> 32:18.018
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

32:18.102 --> 32:21.897
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

32:21.981 --> 32:25.609
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.361
Okay. Sample.

32:29.405 --> 32:33.700
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

32:34.369 --> 32:38.330
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.582
Right.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.237
So, here I go.

33:35.721 --> 33:39.558
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

33:43.312 --> 33:44.896
It's already pissed off.

33:45.106 --> 33:48.024
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.951
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.370
So, what do I do, dance with it?

34:00.830 --> 34:03.915
Just hold your ground.

34:19.014 --> 34:21.391
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

34:22.518 --> 34:24.478
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.898
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

34:29.442 --> 34:32.027
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

34:32.110 --> 34:35.030
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

34:35.114 --> 34:38.116
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.329
Oh, shit.

34:54.132 --> 34:56.635
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

34:58.054 --> 35:00.096
Run! Definitely run!

38:46.574 --> 38:47.866
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.869
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.915
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to
hang on till morning.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.542
He won't make it till morning.

40:50.447 --> 40:52.407
I don't have all goddamn night.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.326
Come on! Come on!

42:09.276 --> 42:10.902
Hey, wait. Don't!

42:14.406 --> 42:15.531
Great.

43:13.007 --> 43:16.551
Look, I know you probably don't
understand this,

43:22.641 --> 43:23.891
but thank you.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.481
Thank you.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.945
That was pretty impressive.

43:38.657 --> 43:41.617
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was...

43:45.164 --> 43:48.291
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

43:49.293 --> 43:50.752
Wait up!

43:51.503 --> 43:53.337
Just... Hey, slow down.

43:53.338 --> 43:56.424
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

43:57.509 --> 44:00.553
- Damn!
- Don't thank.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.848
You don't thank for this.

44:05.392 --> 44:09.353
This is sad. Very sad only.

44:10.272 --> 44:12.356
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.026
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

44:18.530 --> 44:21.699
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

44:22.534 --> 44:24.619
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

44:24.703 --> 44:26.370
Your fault!

44:26.830 --> 44:29.540
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

44:29.625 --> 44:33.377
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

44:33.378 --> 44:34.879
Easy.

44:37.132 --> 44:39.550
Fine. Fine.

44:40.719 --> 44:42.845
If you love your little forest friends,

44:44.389 --> 44:46.224
why not let them just kill my ass?

44:47.226 --> 44:49.018
What's the thinking?

44:49.812 --> 44:52.522
- Why save you?
- Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

44:56.944 --> 44:58.903
You have a strong heart.

45:01.031 --> 45:02.240
No fear.

45:06.745 --> 45:09.622
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

45:16.046 --> 45:18.464
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

45:19.133 --> 45:21.342
Look, maybe you should teach me.

45:21.426 --> 45:23.636
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

45:23.720 --> 45:25.638
Well, then teach me how to See.

45:25.639 --> 45:28.182
- No one can teach you to See.
- Whoa.

45:29.476 --> 45:31.936
Look, come on, can't we talk?

45:32.896 --> 45:36.774
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

45:41.613 --> 45:42.446
You're like a baby.

45:42.447 --> 45:43.322
You're like a baby.

45:49.496 --> 45:51.122
I need your help.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.083
You should not be here.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.837
- Okay, take me with you.
- No! Go back.

46:00.507 --> 46:01.549
No.

46:03.051 --> 46:04.302
Go back.

46:25.908 --> 46:26.949
No!

46:48.722 --> 46:49.931
What...

46:53.685 --> 46:55.186
What are they?

46:56.521 --> 46:58.522
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

46:59.566 --> 47:01.234
Very pure spirits.

47:25.342 --> 47:27.301
What was that all about?

47:29.388 --> 47:30.513
Come.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.057
Come!

47:35.227 --> 47:36.560
Where are we going?

47:47.072 --> 47:48.155
Come.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.047
What's your name?

48:05.132 --> 48:06.215
Shit!

48:31.700 --> 48:32.825
Okay.

48:35.537 --> 48:38.414
Calm people, calm.

48:44.171 --> 48:47.006
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

48:49.468 --> 48:52.386
These demons are forbidden here.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.514
There has been a sign.

48:55.515 --> 48:57.850
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

49:02.689 --> 49:03.689
Bring him.

49:05.192 --> 49:06.776
What's going on?

49:09.112 --> 49:10.237
Wait.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.825
What's happening?

49:15.702 --> 49:16.702
Hey!

50:26.898 --> 50:28.232
Father...

50:29.067 --> 50:30.860
I see you.

50:42.581 --> 50:43.998
This creature...

50:44.291 --> 50:47.376
why do you bring him here?

50:48.837 --> 50:50.212
I was going to kill him...

50:50.505 --> 50:52.339
but there was a sign from Eywa.

50:52.507 --> 50:54.592
I have said...

50:54.593 --> 50:57.261
no dreamwalker will come here.

50:57.345 --> 50:58.679
What's he saying?

50:58.680 --> 51:01.515
His alien smell fills my nose.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.683
Hey, what's he saying?

51:02.684 --> 51:04.935
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

51:06.563 --> 51:09.523
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

51:13.195 --> 51:14.695
Step back!

51:16.823 --> 51:20.242
I will look at this alien.

51:20.368 --> 51:21.660
That is Mother.

51:21.661 --> 51:25.664
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.875
Who's Eywa?

51:34.716 --> 51:36.467
What are you called?

51:37.385 --> 51:38.761
Jake Sully.

51:48.688 --> 51:51.482
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.

51:52.859 --> 51:55.819
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

51:55.904 --> 51:59.240
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

52:00.742 --> 52:03.077
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

52:04.287 --> 52:06.956
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.499
What are you?

52:10.752 --> 52:13.963
I was a Marine. A...

52:14.839 --> 52:17.466
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

52:17.926 --> 52:19.260
A warrior!

52:19.261 --> 52:20.844
I could kill him easily!

52:20.845 --> 52:22.137
I could kill him easily! No!

52:22.556 --> 52:26.767
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

52:26.768 --> 52:28.727
we have seen.

52:28.728 --> 52:31.605
We need to learn more about him.

52:34.025 --> 52:35.985
My Daughter...

52:35.986 --> 52:40.364
you will teach him our way...

52:40.365 --> 52:43.826
to speak and walk as we do.

52:43.827 --> 52:47.454
Why me? That's not fair...

52:48.248 --> 52:52.376
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

52:52.460 --> 52:56.046
Learn well, Jakesully.

52:56.840 --> 53:00.634
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

53:19.362 --> 53:20.821
Good evening.

53:23.867 --> 53:25.659
Please don't get up.

53:27.495 --> 53:28.829
Excuse me.

53:31.166 --> 53:32.333
Sorry.

53:35.420 --> 53:37.129
Hey, how you doing?

53:45.722 --> 53:46.722
Thank you.

53:49.267 --> 53:51.602
You know, I don't
even know your name.

53:52.312 --> 53:54.730
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

53:57.025 --> 53:58.942
Again, a whole lot slower?

53:58.985 --> 54:00.277
Neytiri.

54:00.362 --> 54:01.987
Neytili.

54:02.489 --> 54:04.281
Neytiri.

54:04.741 --> 54:06.658
Neytiri.

54:07.660 --> 54:09.661
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.

54:10.288 --> 54:11.538
It's nice.

54:54.374 --> 54:56.667
- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha.

54:56.751 --> 54:59.795
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake. Jake!

55:01.589 --> 55:04.675
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

55:06.344 --> 55:09.012
There you go. There you go, there you go.

55:09.097 --> 55:11.473
You're okay. You're okay.

55:11.558 --> 55:14.476
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

55:17.564 --> 55:20.107
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.

55:21.234 --> 55:23.944
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

55:24.946 --> 55:27.948
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

55:28.032 --> 55:32.161
disappearing into the brush with
this angry thanator coming after him.

55:32.162 --> 55:35.164
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

55:35.248 --> 55:37.624
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

55:37.625 --> 55:40.961
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

55:42.297 --> 55:43.797
"Jarhead clan"?

55:45.383 --> 55:48.427
- And it worked?
- Hey, I'm practically family.

55:49.512 --> 55:53.015
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

55:53.016 --> 55:54.683
That's called taking the initiative, son.

55:54.684 --> 55:57.227
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look, Sully. Sully.

55:57.312 --> 56:00.731
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

56:01.483 --> 56:07.321
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

56:07.322 --> 56:09.156
But no, no, no, they like mud.

56:09.240 --> 56:13.202
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're...

56:13.786 --> 56:16.830
Hey, can you... Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

56:18.625 --> 56:21.835
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

56:21.836 --> 56:24.046
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

56:24.047 --> 56:30.219
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

56:30.220 --> 56:35.599
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

56:39.354 --> 56:41.855
- Well, who gets them to move?
- Guess.

56:43.775 --> 56:47.319
- What if they won't go?
- I'm betting that they will.

56:47.820 --> 56:50.531
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

56:51.366 --> 56:54.201
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

56:54.285 --> 56:58.038
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

56:58.122 --> 57:01.375
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

57:01.376 --> 57:04.586
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

57:05.338 --> 57:08.423
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

57:09.008 --> 57:12.719
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

57:12.804 --> 57:14.805
Well, we're wasting time.

57:15.765 --> 57:16.890
I like this guy.

57:17.058 --> 57:20.561
- Guys, right now...
- Okay, let's run through them again.

57:20.562 --> 57:22.896
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

57:24.941 --> 57:27.901
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

57:27.986 --> 57:31.154
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

57:31.239 --> 57:32.823
Got it.

57:32.907 --> 57:35.117
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

57:35.201 --> 57:37.911
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

57:39.956 --> 57:42.416
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.

57:42.500 --> 57:44.501
They become a mated pair.

57:45.503 --> 57:47.754
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?

57:48.673 --> 57:52.259
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

57:52.343 --> 57:53.719
Everything they know!

57:53.761 --> 57:55.887
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

57:55.972 --> 57:57.347
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

57:57.390 --> 57:59.099
Come on. That's...

57:59.642 --> 58:01.768
Knock it off. It's like kindergarten
around here.

58:03.855 --> 58:06.815
Neytiri was my best student.

58:06.899 --> 58:09.901
She and her sister, Sylwanin.

58:09.986 --> 58:12.404
Just amazing girls.

58:12.488 --> 58:14.072
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

58:14.991 --> 58:16.033
She's dead.

58:19.912 --> 58:22.456
Let's go. Village life starts early.

58:24.667 --> 58:27.169
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

58:46.356 --> 58:47.689
Easy, boy.

58:48.316 --> 58:50.400
Pale is female.

58:53.363 --> 58:55.781
Okay. Easy, girl.

58:57.806 --> 59:00.806
SharePirate.Com-Movie Stream and Downloads

59:24.560 --> 59:28.313
That is shahaylu. The bond.

59:30.483 --> 59:31.733
Feel her.

59:34.862 --> 59:38.990
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

59:41.994 --> 59:43.787
Feel her strong legs.

59:46.249 --> 59:48.583
You may tell her what to do.

59:48.668 --> 59:49.876
Inside.

59:50.837 --> 59:53.755
For now, say where to go.

59:56.759 --> 59:58.009
Forward!

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:18.738
- You should go away.
- No, you'd miss me.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:22.451
I knew you could speak English.

01:00:25.037 --> 01:00:27.205
This alien will learn nothing...

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:29.249
a rock sees more...

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.501
look at him.

01:00:40.761 --> 01:00:41.845
Again.

01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:45.432
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.934
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.145
There's an outer row of columns.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:52.981
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:56.610
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.112
That's how they move up and down.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:02.115
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:03.492
Roger that.

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:06.286
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:09.122
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:17.130
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:22.677
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:26.014
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

01:01:26.098 --> 01:01:28.058
way up in the mountains.

01:01:28.809 --> 01:01:31.186
The Hallelujah Mountains?

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.480
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:35.524
- Yeah.
- Yes!

01:01:38.986 --> 01:01:42.656
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:58.046
We're getting close.

01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:00.840
Yeah, look at my instruments.

01:02:00.841 --> 01:02:03.885
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.221
We're VFR from here on.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.181
What's VFR?

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:10.559
Means you gotta see where you're going.

01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:14.563
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.709
Oh, my God.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:48.096
You should see your faces.

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:17.542
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:33.266
So what does hold them up?

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:34.809
Grace explained it to me.

01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:37.479
Some kind of maglev effect.

01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:41.399
Because unobtanium is
a superconductor... or something.

01:04:03.964 --> 01:04:05.548
Welcome to camp.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:14.057
- So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.394
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:21.022
- Grace didn't miss a thing.
- Trudy, you'll take the top one.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.525
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:27.237
But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:28.863
so she's playing nice.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:34.035
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:41.000
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

01:05:30.217 --> 01:05:31.551
Holy shit!

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.345
Do not look in her eye.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.606
Ikran is not horse.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.609
Once shahaylu is made,

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:55.825
ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life.

01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:08.505
To become taronyu, hunter,

01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:12.175
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.763
- When?
- When you are ready.

01:07:07.147 --> 01:07:10.316
Okay. This is video log 12.

01:07:11.485 --> 01:07:13.194
Time's 2132.

01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:18.032
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack.

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:20.910
No, now. When it's fresh.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:25.415
Okay, location, shack,

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.710
and the days are starting to blur together.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:34.090
The language is a pain, but, you know,

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:35.685
I figure it's like
field-stripping a weapon.

01:07:35.698 --> 01:07:37.302
Just repetition, repetition.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.053
- Navi.
- "Nari."

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:41.389
- Nari.
- "Narrri"!

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.682
Narrri!

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.643
TxurnÌ'ul. Stronger.

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:53.902
Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.739
This is a very important part of it.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.949
- Norm's attitude has improved lately.
- I see you. I see you.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.410
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.078
it's "I see into you. I See you."

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:06.831
It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.167
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

01:08:09.501 --> 01:08:12.462
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:16.841
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day.

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:21.845
I have to trust my body
to know what to do.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.685
Yeah! Check it out!

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:30.772
Oh, crap!

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:39.948
Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.200
the tiniest scents and sounds.

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:52.542
She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:56.005
I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:59.801
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.511
You need to listen to what she says.

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:05.807
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.434
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:26.411
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:29.831
You gotta be kidding me.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.903
I talked Mo'at into
letting Grace into the village.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.656
Look how big you are.

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:04.657
It's the first time
since her school was closed down.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.492
You are so pretty.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.315
Come on, Marine.

01:11:02.549 --> 01:11:05.259
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:07.553
the people have to the forest.

01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:10.848
She talks about a network of energy

01:11:11.683 --> 01:11:14.268
that flows through all living things.

01:11:15.145 --> 01:11:18.481
She says all energy is only borrowed,

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.984
and one day you have to give it back.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:05.528
You were in 16 hours today.

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:10.408
You're still losing weight.

01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:16.581
No, you don't.

01:12:16.623 --> 01:12:19.375
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Come back here.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.045
Bon appétit.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:26.966
Today I made a kill.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:30.761
And we ate it. At least,
I know where that meal came from.

01:12:31.096 --> 01:12:35.266
Other body. You need to
take care of this body. Okay?

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.059
- Get it? Let's eat it.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:40.062
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

01:12:40.105 --> 01:12:42.356
Give it to me.

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:43.941
- You look like crap.
- Thank you.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.776
You're burning way too hard.

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:48.696
Get rid of this shit.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.698
And then you can lecture me.

01:12:51.783 --> 01:12:54.493
Now, I'm telling you,
as your boss,

01:12:55.954 --> 01:12:59.290
and as someone who might even
consider being a friend someday

01:12:59.374 --> 01:13:01.792
to take some down time.

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.628
Eat this, please.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:08.382
Trust me, I...
learned the hard way.

01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:25.566
What did happen at the school, Grace?

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:39.372
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin,
stopped coming to school.

01:13:39.456 --> 01:13:41.499
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:46.879
And one day, she and a couple of
other young hunters came running in

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:50.091
all painted up.

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:52.802
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

01:13:56.139 --> 01:13:59.016
I guess they thought
I could protect them.

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:04.647
The troopers pursued them
to the school.

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:08.025
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:10.403
Right in front of Neytiri.

01:14:10.487 --> 01:14:11.654
And then shot the others.

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:15.950
I got most of the kids out.

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:21.622
But they never came back.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.460
I'm sorry.

01:14:35.053 --> 01:14:38.848
A scientist stays objective.

01:14:39.683 --> 01:14:43.561
We can't be ruled by emotion.

01:14:43.603 --> 01:14:46.814
But I put 10 years of my life
into that school.

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:50.568
They called me sa'nok.

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:53.654
Mother.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:54.739
Mother.

01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:01.579
That kind of pain
reaches back through the link.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:29.440
I see you... Brother

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.109
and thank you.

01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:38.115
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

01:15:38.658 --> 01:15:40.493
Your body stays behind...

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:43.454
to become part of The People.

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:48.626
A clean kill.

01:15:51.963 --> 01:15:53.464
You are ready.

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:22.493
Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:25.162
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:30.709
But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are.

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:32.753
Oo-rah.

01:17:04.244 --> 01:17:05.494
Now what?

01:18:53.603 --> 01:18:55.562
Jakesully will go first.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:32.433
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside.

01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:36.312
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

01:19:36.396 --> 01:19:39.273
You will have one chance, Jake.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.442
How will I know if he chooses me?

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:43.485
He will try to kill you.

01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:46.071
Outstanding.

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:47.758
Let's dance.

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:55.766
That moron's going to die.

01:21:19.624 --> 01:21:21.583
Don't be afraid, warrior.

01:21:21.584 --> 01:21:23.085
Make the bond!

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:27.423
No!

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.511
Jake!

01:21:46.526 --> 01:21:48.152
Shahaylu, Jake.

01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:51.780
Shahaylu!

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.000
Stop!

01:22:11.634 --> 01:22:16.722
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:32.905
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

01:22:34.407 --> 01:22:36.575
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.460
God damn!

01:22:50.882 --> 01:22:52.132
Oh, shit!

01:23:01.601 --> 01:23:03.769
Shut up and fly straight!

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:16.365
That's it. Bank left!

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.459
Level out! That's it.

01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:34.299
Jakesully!

01:23:59.075 --> 01:24:00.158
Hey!

01:24:06.165 --> 01:24:07.499
Let's go!

01:24:19.929 --> 01:24:21.847
Yeah, baby, I got this!

01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:23.932
Oh, shit!

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.983
I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.

01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:34.901
Yeah!

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:39.031
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:41.522
I turn. I feel the wind.
I turn very strong.

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:44.036
Look, yeah, see, I
banked so hard...

01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:48.100
The Tree of Souls.

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:53.730
It's their most sacred place.

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:57.317
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

01:25:57.402 --> 01:25:59.486
Yeah, that's what messes up
my instruments.

01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:04.116
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:07.577
I would die to get samples.

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:10.997
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:12.416
You lucky swine.

01:27:33.789 --> 01:27:34.873
Hell, yeah!

01:27:34.957 --> 01:27:36.500
Hell, yeah!

01:27:49.305 --> 01:27:53.016
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.

01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:57.354
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

01:28:01.317 --> 01:28:02.400
Dive!

01:28:25.174 --> 01:28:26.383
Go, go!

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:35.892
Follow me!

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:24.941
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

01:29:25.818 --> 01:29:28.862
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:33.742
Yeah, right. It's the
last one you ever see.

01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:42.125
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto.

01:29:42.793 --> 01:29:44.586
Rider of Last Shadow.

01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:47.422
He rode this?

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.675
Toruk chose him.

01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:54.888
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

01:29:54.972 --> 01:29:56.973
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

01:29:57.683 --> 01:29:59.559
Toruk Macto was mighty.

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:05.231
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

01:30:05.232 --> 01:30:07.567
All Na'vi people know the story.

01:30:14.283 --> 01:30:18.495
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world

01:30:19.622 --> 01:30:21.623
and in here is the dream.

01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:45.021
It's hard to believe
it's only been three months.

01:30:48.067 --> 01:30:50.527
I can barely remember my old life.

01:30:54.073 --> 01:30:55.907
I don't know who I am anymore.

01:31:14.677 --> 01:31:17.512
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

01:31:20.683 --> 01:31:23.601
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:28.314
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

01:31:30.901 --> 01:31:33.486
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:35.363
No, I can do this.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:37.073
You already have.

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:40.285
You give me good, usable intel.

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:42.495
This Tree of Souls place.

01:31:42.955 --> 01:31:46.332
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

01:31:46.417 --> 01:31:48.168
which it will. Yeah.

01:31:49.128 --> 01:31:51.129
Now it's time to come in.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.466
By the way,

01:31:54.967 --> 01:31:56.968
you gonna get your legs back.

01:31:57.845 --> 01:32:01.514
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:03.975
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

01:32:04.059 --> 01:32:05.852
I'm a man of my word.

01:32:08.773 --> 01:32:10.523
I gotta finish this.

01:32:12.818 --> 01:32:14.360
There's one more thing.

01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:20.033
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

01:32:22.536 --> 01:32:24.662
If I do it, I'm one of them.

01:32:26.165 --> 01:32:27.957
And they'll trust me.

01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:34.798
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

01:32:48.395 --> 01:32:50.897
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

01:33:08.332 --> 01:33:12.335
The Na'vi say
that every person is born twice.

01:33:14.338 --> 01:33:19.759
The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever.

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:29.561
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:34.023
You are part of The People.

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.322
Come. Come.

01:34:39.965 --> 01:34:42.675
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

01:34:44.303 --> 01:34:46.179
And sometimes answered.

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:56.731
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

01:34:57.733 --> 01:34:59.484
The Tree of Voices.

01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:03.655
The voices of our ancestors.

01:35:18.671 --> 01:35:20.254
I can hear them.

01:35:25.177 --> 01:35:26.803
They live, Jake,

01:35:28.847 --> 01:35:30.264
within Eywa.

01:35:34.436 --> 01:35:36.312
You are Omaticaya now.

01:35:37.022 --> 01:35:40.149
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

01:35:45.656 --> 01:35:47.740
And you may choose a woman.

01:35:49.868 --> 01:35:51.828
We have many fine women.

01:35:53.038 --> 01:35:55.039
Ninat is the best singer.

01:35:57.918 --> 01:35:59.836
But I don't want Ninat.

01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:06.092
Beyral is a good hunter.

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:09.846
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

01:36:11.932 --> 01:36:13.683
I've already chosen.

01:36:17.187 --> 01:36:19.689
But this woman must also choose me.

01:36:23.694 --> 01:36:25.319
She already has.

01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:21.709
I am with you now, Jake.

01:37:23.253 --> 01:37:25.129
We are mated for life.

01:37:31.428 --> 01:37:33.471
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

01:38:03.919 --> 01:38:05.044
Ma Jake!

01:38:05.128 --> 01:38:06.420
Don't forget your phase integration.

01:38:06.505 --> 01:38:07.905
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

01:38:07.923 --> 01:38:09.841
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

01:38:18.267 --> 01:38:23.229
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

01:38:23.856 --> 01:38:26.357
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

01:38:27.526 --> 01:38:29.110
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:34.031
Jake!

01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:44.041
Okay.

01:38:55.137 --> 01:38:57.221
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

01:38:57.222 --> 01:38:59.557
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

01:38:59.558 --> 01:39:01.642
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

01:39:05.772 --> 01:39:07.064
Jake!

01:39:13.822 --> 01:39:18.743
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

01:39:22.247 --> 01:39:23.581
Hey!

01:39:24.249 --> 01:39:26.751
Stop! Stop!

01:39:26.752 --> 01:39:29.587
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

01:39:33.759 --> 01:39:35.092
Hey, boss.

01:39:35.594 --> 01:39:36.761
Hey!

01:39:39.348 --> 01:39:40.431
- What?
- I got a native

01:39:40.515 --> 01:39:43.476
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.687
Well, keep going. He'll move.

01:39:46.772 --> 01:39:50.024
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:54.570
Stop! Hey!

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:56.948
Go! Go!

01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:59.408
There, see? He moved.

01:40:11.797 --> 01:40:14.674
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:15.675
I'm blind.

01:40:27.604 --> 01:40:29.855
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

01:40:31.441 --> 01:40:33.109
Here, come on!

01:40:58.010 --> 01:41:00.594
Freeze it right there.

01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:04.640
Scale up. Enhance.

01:41:06.268 --> 01:41:07.810
Son of a bitch.

01:41:09.312 --> 01:41:10.771
Unbelievable.

01:41:11.857 --> 01:41:13.983
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:20.782 --> 01:41:22.950
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

01:41:29.541 --> 01:41:30.833
Stop please!

01:41:32.335 --> 01:41:34.462
This will only make it worse.

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:36.255
You do not speak here!

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:39.216
We will strike them in the heart.

01:41:47.017 --> 01:41:49.185
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

01:41:52.314 --> 01:41:53.856
- You!
- Listen. Brother...

01:41:59.321 --> 01:42:02.490
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh, shit.

01:42:03.742 --> 01:42:05.743
Is this true?

01:42:07.245 --> 01:42:10.456
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

01:42:11.833 --> 01:42:13.000
Brother, please.

01:42:13.085 --> 01:42:16.921
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

01:42:16.922 --> 01:42:19.256
You are not my brother!

01:42:22.427 --> 01:42:24.220
And I am not your enemy!

01:42:25.847 --> 01:42:28.724
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

01:42:30.977 --> 01:42:32.770
Go! Go! Go!

01:42:35.982 --> 01:42:38.484
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:39.902
Tsu'tey!

01:42:46.118 --> 01:42:49.036
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.081
And I have the right to speak.

01:42:56.711 --> 01:42:58.587
I have something to say...

01:43:00.924 --> 01:43:02.383
to all of you.

01:43:06.429 --> 01:43:08.514
The words are like stones in my heart.

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.854
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:17.148
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

01:43:18.316 --> 01:43:19.650
It's very dangerous!

01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:23.445
Grace!

01:43:24.656 --> 01:43:25.865
Oh, no.

01:43:26.074 --> 01:43:28.075
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

01:43:29.578 --> 01:43:31.829
Okay. Look...

01:43:32.914 --> 01:43:34.248
I was sent here to...

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:39.295
You see?

01:43:39.462 --> 01:43:41.922
It is a demon in a false body.

01:44:01.818 --> 01:44:05.196
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.

01:44:08.658 --> 01:44:10.826
Wheel this meat out of here.

01:44:12.537 --> 01:44:15.080
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

01:44:18.335 --> 01:44:20.127
You let me down, son.

01:44:22.088 --> 01:44:23.380
So, what,

01:44:24.883 --> 01:44:26.926
you find yourself some local tail

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:30.137
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

01:44:30.222 --> 01:44:32.723
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

01:44:32.807 --> 01:44:35.392
- Parker...
- Shut your pie hole!

01:44:35.393 --> 01:44:39.605
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

01:44:39.689 --> 01:44:42.441
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.

01:44:42.525 --> 01:44:45.277
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

01:44:45.362 --> 01:44:47.905
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

01:44:47.906 --> 01:44:49.949
You start by listening to her.

01:44:50.033 --> 01:44:52.326
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:54.245
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

01:44:54.246 --> 01:44:56.622
You throw a stick in the air around here,

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:59.625
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

01:44:59.709 --> 01:45:01.126
- for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking

01:45:01.127 --> 01:45:05.631
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:07.800
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:08.300
Something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

01:45:08.385 --> 01:45:09.885
Which is what, exactly?

01:45:10.929 --> 01:45:12.304
What we think we know

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:15.766
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

01:45:15.767 --> 01:45:20.187
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

01:45:20.272 --> 01:45:24.858
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

01:45:24.943 --> 01:45:28.112
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:31.323
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:33.742
It's more connections
than the human brain.

01:45:34.911 --> 01:45:37.496
Get it? It's a network.

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:40.541
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

01:45:40.625 --> 01:45:44.169
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

01:45:44.170 --> 01:45:46.922
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:48.590
Yes!

01:45:49.801 --> 01:45:53.929
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

01:45:54.556 --> 01:45:56.640
They're just goddamn trees!

01:45:58.393 --> 01:46:01.186
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

01:46:01.187 --> 01:46:05.691
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

01:46:05.775 --> 01:46:09.486
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

01:46:09.571 --> 01:46:13.866
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:18.662
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:22.833
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

01:46:22.917 --> 01:46:25.169
They're not gonna give up their home.

01:46:26.963 --> 01:46:28.630
They're not gonna make a deal.

01:46:29.674 --> 01:46:31.967
For what? Lite beer?

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:34.094
And blue jeans?

01:46:37.349 --> 01:46:40.225
There's nothing that we have
that they want.

01:46:42.145 --> 01:46:45.189
Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time.

01:46:50.111 --> 01:46:51.528
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

01:46:54.407 --> 01:47:00.412
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

01:47:00.622 --> 01:47:05.125
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

01:47:05.168 --> 01:47:07.795
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

01:47:33.488 --> 01:47:35.197
Talk to me, Lyle.

01:47:35.532 --> 01:47:38.075
It looks like they hit it
with banshees first.

01:47:38.201 --> 01:47:39.868
See the angle's steep?

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:46.125
They set the ampsuit on fire.

01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:47.709
Driver's toast.

01:47:49.212 --> 01:47:50.963
The rest of the squad?

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:55.050
Six bodies. That's all of them.

01:47:56.511 --> 01:47:57.719
The equipment's totaled.

01:48:00.557 --> 01:48:03.016
Jesus Christ.

01:48:06.187 --> 01:48:09.565
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

01:48:10.442 --> 01:48:12.943
I'll drive them out with gas first.

01:48:14.195 --> 01:48:15.779
It'll be humane.

01:48:17.407 --> 01:48:18.866
More or less.

01:48:20.577 --> 01:48:22.411
All right, let's pull the trigger.

01:48:25.874 --> 01:48:28.250
Come on, people.
Let's get it packed, let's go.

01:48:28.585 --> 01:48:31.753
You know, they never even
wanted us to succeed.

01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:38.135
They bulldozed a sacred site
on purpose to trigger a response.

01:48:38.219 --> 01:48:40.929
Just fabricating this war
to get what they want.

01:48:41.514 --> 01:48:43.390
This is how it's done.

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:49.480
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

01:48:49.564 --> 01:48:53.609
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:56.987
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

01:48:57.071 --> 01:48:58.071
My God.

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:08.790
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
- Back off!

01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:12.586
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to...

01:49:12.587 --> 01:49:13.754
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

01:49:13.755 --> 01:49:17.257
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

01:49:17.258 --> 01:49:18.967
All right? Look around!

01:49:19.052 --> 01:49:22.763
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

01:49:22.847 --> 01:49:24.306
- Can you guys just please...
- Yes, sir.

01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:26.975
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

01:49:26.976 --> 01:49:28.268
Are you gonna kill children?

01:49:28.353 --> 01:49:32.272
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

01:49:32.357 --> 01:49:34.775
Just let me try to talk them out.

01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:37.069
They trust me.

01:49:40.323 --> 01:49:42.824
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

01:49:42.825 --> 01:49:44.826
Calibrating three and four.

01:49:44.827 --> 01:49:47.788
- Run sequence.
- Initiating. Thirty seconds.

01:49:52.168 --> 01:49:53.961
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

01:49:53.962 --> 01:49:56.630
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

01:49:56.631 --> 01:49:59.299
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

01:50:05.348 --> 01:50:06.473
Father!

01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:07.683
Mother!

01:50:07.684 --> 01:50:10.936
Eytukan, I have something to say.

01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:12.437
Listen!

01:50:13.481 --> 01:50:14.940
Speak, Jakesully.

01:50:16.317 --> 01:50:19.278
A great evil is upon us...

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:21.488
The Sky People are coming...

01:50:21.739 --> 01:50:24.241
to destroy Hometree.

01:50:26.703 --> 01:50:28.383
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

01:50:30.707 --> 01:50:33.542
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

01:50:33.543 --> 01:50:35.502
Are you certain of this?

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:43.010
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

01:50:44.178 --> 01:50:47.472
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

01:50:50.018 --> 01:50:53.645
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

01:50:56.858 --> 01:50:58.400
Yes.

01:50:58.401 --> 01:51:00.861
Look, at first it was just orders,

01:51:02.363 --> 01:51:04.740
and then everything changed.

01:51:04.741 --> 01:51:06.533
Okay? I fell in love.

01:51:07.201 --> 01:51:12.497
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

01:51:13.666 --> 01:51:15.125
And with you.

01:51:16.085 --> 01:51:17.919
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:20.881
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now, please.

01:51:28.222 --> 01:51:30.724
You will never be one of The People!

01:51:30.725 --> 01:51:32.601
- I shouldn't have...
- We tried to stop them!

01:51:32.602 --> 01:51:34.645
Neytiri, please! Please.

01:51:39.567 --> 01:51:40.734
Bind them.

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:43.487
Leave now!

01:51:43.655 --> 01:51:46.990
You have to go. They're coming!

01:52:00.838 --> 01:52:03.090
Time on target, one mike.

01:52:03.091 --> 01:52:05.133
Copy. We have a visual.

01:52:05.134 --> 01:52:08.178
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

01:52:08.262 --> 01:52:09.596
Roger, 030.

01:52:23.403 --> 01:52:25.445
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

01:52:27.073 --> 01:52:30.909
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri, you must go now!

01:52:34.664 --> 01:52:36.957
Run to the forest! Run!

01:52:39.335 --> 01:52:40.669
Run! Run!

01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:44.339
Have no fear.

01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:04.943
No! God damn it, run!

01:53:05.153 --> 01:53:08.280
Take the ikran...
attack from above.

01:53:12.535 --> 01:53:14.745
That is one big damn tree.

01:53:22.253 --> 01:53:26.465
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

01:53:28.426 --> 01:53:30.510
All right, people, let's get this done!

01:53:30.595 --> 01:53:33.513
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

01:53:33.514 --> 01:53:35.557
Roger. CS.40's going hot.

01:53:35.933 --> 01:53:37.142
- Fire.
- Firing.

01:53:48.571 --> 01:53:50.614
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

01:53:58.539 --> 01:54:00.207
Sir, they've opened fire.

01:54:02.084 --> 01:54:03.835
You've got to be kidding me!

01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:18.892
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

01:54:18.976 --> 01:54:20.727
All right, let's turn up the heat.

01:54:20.728 --> 01:54:23.730
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.

01:54:23.731 --> 01:54:24.856
Fire.

01:54:28.152 --> 01:54:29.236
No!

01:54:42.458 --> 01:54:44.209
Get everyone to the forest.

01:54:47.588 --> 01:54:49.798
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:54.761
Neytiri!

01:55:03.437 --> 01:55:06.481
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:07.858
My God!

01:55:26.419 --> 01:55:29.796
- Mo'at! No!
- Lf you are one of us,

01:55:31.299 --> 01:55:32.632
help us.

01:55:40.391 --> 01:55:42.392
All call signs, switch missiles.

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.978
Give me HE's
at the base of the west columns.

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:48.189
This way!

01:55:49.317 --> 01:55:51.192
Rider section, switch missiles.

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:53.236
- One's good.
- Two's rocks up.

01:55:53.321 --> 01:55:55.864
- Three's up.
- Yeah, baby, get some!

01:55:56.407 --> 01:55:58.658
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

01:55:58.743 --> 01:56:00.160
- Bring it down.
- Cleared hot.

01:56:07.209 --> 01:56:08.793
Come on, Grace, move!

01:56:11.422 --> 01:56:13.006
Down! Head down!

01:56:15.593 --> 01:56:17.844
Come on, come on! Down!

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:24.601
- Solid hits.
- Solid rocks on target.

01:56:24.685 --> 01:56:25.852
Screw this.

01:56:27.104 --> 01:56:29.105
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:30.982
I didn't sign up for this shit!

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.535
Repeat. Ripple fire.

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.622
Go! Go! Go!

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:03.199
No, no, get back! Back!

01:58:22.219 --> 01:58:24.804
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:13.436
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

01:59:14.105 --> 01:59:15.355
Let's boogie.

01:59:15.773 --> 01:59:18.191
Dragon coming left, heading home.

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:20.568
Gunrunner coming left.

01:59:20.653 --> 01:59:23.196
- Thunder copies.
- Rider section copies.

01:59:30.788 --> 01:59:31.871
Father!

01:59:47.721 --> 01:59:49.055
Daughter...

01:59:50.224 --> 01:59:53.309
take... my... bow.

01:59:57.439 --> 02:00:01.901
Protect The People.

02:00:10.286 --> 02:00:11.536
Neytiri!

02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:25.300
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get away.

02:00:25.968 --> 02:00:27.260
Get away!

02:00:28.345 --> 02:00:30.096
Get away from here!

02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:33.141
Never come back!

02:00:50.826 --> 02:00:51.951
Pull the plug.

02:00:52.953 --> 02:00:55.622
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

02:00:55.623 --> 02:00:57.624
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

02:01:13.807 --> 02:01:16.351
I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace.

02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:21.648
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

02:01:24.485 --> 02:01:25.944
Let's go!

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:35.370
Put him down!

02:01:38.749 --> 02:01:41.501
You murderer!

02:02:28.132 --> 02:02:30.216
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

02:02:30.301 --> 02:02:31.384
Hey.

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.430
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

02:02:35.514 --> 02:02:38.891
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

02:02:39.893 --> 02:02:42.437
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:45.064
- Trudy!
- All the way down.

02:02:48.444 --> 02:02:49.694
Max!

02:02:59.747 --> 02:03:02.248
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

02:03:02.833 --> 02:03:03.916
Here.

02:03:16.013 --> 02:03:18.473
- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.

02:03:34.031 --> 02:03:37.992
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

02:03:37.993 --> 02:03:39.285
Okay. Go.

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:54.258
Clear.

02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:57.512
Come on, baby.

02:03:57.513 --> 02:04:00.306
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:06.979
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

02:04:10.025 --> 02:04:11.317
Three!

02:04:14.154 --> 02:04:15.363
Come on!

02:04:17.324 --> 02:04:18.658
Mask on!

02:04:21.245 --> 02:04:23.079
Gas, gas, gas!

02:04:24.706 --> 02:04:26.749
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

02:04:29.211 --> 02:04:32.338
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:35.174
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

02:04:47.813 --> 02:04:49.147
Colonel!

02:04:55.863 --> 02:04:59.407
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

02:05:02.619 --> 02:05:05.288
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?

02:05:05.372 --> 02:05:06.914
Oh, yeah, baby!

02:05:06.915 --> 02:05:08.833
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

02:05:09.710 --> 02:05:12.044
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

02:05:12.296 --> 02:05:14.088
- Grace is hit!
- What?

02:05:15.215 --> 02:05:16.883
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

02:05:16.884 --> 02:05:20.386
- Keep the pressure on, Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

02:05:20.471 --> 02:05:24.974
- Hang on, Grace.
- Doesn't matter. It's fine.

02:05:28.312 --> 02:05:30.771
- You're good to go.
- Take it up!

02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:33.774
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:39.655
You're clear!

02:05:47.581 --> 02:05:50.333
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

02:05:50.417 --> 02:05:51.834
Copy that.

02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:02.094
- Norm, you all good up there?
- Yep! Still here.

02:06:03.972 --> 02:06:08.643
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:10.770
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

02:06:10.854 --> 02:06:12.355
Yeah.

02:06:12.439 --> 02:06:14.398
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

02:06:23.242 --> 02:06:24.408
Ouch.

02:06:27.788 --> 02:06:29.247
You big baby.

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:32.041
We're moving.

02:06:32.584 --> 02:06:34.627
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:37.755
I'm a scientist, remember?

02:06:38.674 --> 02:06:41.133
I don't believe in fairy tales.

02:06:41.969 --> 02:06:43.886
The People can help you.

02:06:44.346 --> 02:06:45.638
I know it.

02:06:47.641 --> 02:06:49.517
Why would they help us?

02:07:05.534 --> 02:07:08.661
The People say Eywa will provide.

02:07:10.581 --> 02:07:13.291
With no home, no hope,

02:07:14.334 --> 02:07:16.502
there was only one place they could go.

02:07:30.934 --> 02:07:32.143
Link's running.

02:07:32.853 --> 02:07:35.855
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.

02:07:36.898 --> 02:07:41.569
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.

02:07:42.529 --> 02:07:43.946
I gotta try.

02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.034
Launching.

02:08:09.514 --> 02:08:10.723
Outcast.

02:08:11.516 --> 02:08:12.767
Betrayer.

02:08:13.852 --> 02:08:15.019
Alien.

02:08:16.563 --> 02:08:19.273
I was in the place the eye does not see.

02:08:30.452 --> 02:08:34.330
I needed their help, and they needed mine.

02:08:35.248 --> 02:08:37.291
But to ever face them again,

02:08:37.292 --> 02:08:39.794
I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.

02:08:48.345 --> 02:08:51.681
Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move.

02:08:54.434 --> 02:08:56.811
There's something we gotta do.

02:08:56.895 --> 02:08:58.604
You're not gonna like it.

02:09:08.615 --> 02:09:12.493
The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

02:09:12.494 --> 02:09:14.161
Nothing attacks him.

02:09:14.663 --> 02:09:15.996
Easy, boy.

02:09:16.456 --> 02:09:18.290
So why would he ever look up?

02:09:19.418 --> 02:09:21.043
But that was just a theory.

02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:33.365
Toruk Macto?

02:11:13.156 --> 02:11:14.657
I See you.

02:11:17.744 --> 02:11:19.078
I See you.

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:29.088
I was afraid, Jake.

02:11:30.507 --> 02:11:32.007
For my people.

02:11:35.053 --> 02:11:36.679
I'm not anymore.

02:11:46.106 --> 02:11:48.440
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:51.110
I stand before you...

02:11:52.112 --> 02:11:55.281
ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

02:11:57.868 --> 02:12:02.121
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior.

02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:05.457
I can't do this without you.

02:12:12.507 --> 02:12:13.924
Toruk Macto,

02:12:21.766 --> 02:12:23.517
I will fly with you.

02:12:26.813 --> 02:12:28.564
My friend is dying.

02:12:30.942 --> 02:12:32.484
Grace is dying.

02:12:34.487 --> 02:12:36.322
I beg the help of Eywa.

02:12:48.251 --> 02:12:50.252
Look where we are, Grace.

02:12:56.968 --> 02:12:59.345
I need to take some samples.

02:13:22.786 --> 02:13:26.872
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

02:13:28.083 --> 02:13:29.541
in this body.

02:13:32.087 --> 02:13:33.754
Is that possible?

02:13:33.838 --> 02:13:38.342
She must pass through the eye of Eywa
and return.

02:13:39.594 --> 02:13:41.136
But, Jakesully,

02:13:42.138 --> 02:13:43.764
she is very weak.

02:13:45.225 --> 02:13:48.060
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

02:13:51.231 --> 02:13:53.857
Hear us please, All Mother.

02:13:54.401 --> 02:13:56.735
Eywa, help her.

02:13:57.404 --> 02:13:59.613
Take this spirit into you...

02:14:03.159 --> 02:14:05.411
and breathe her back to us.

02:14:09.207 --> 02:14:10.874
Let her walk among us...

02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:15.337
as one of The People.

02:14:44.284 --> 02:14:45.367
Jake.

02:14:47.787 --> 02:14:48.954
Grace.

02:14:51.082 --> 02:14:52.791
I'm with her, Jake.

02:14:54.794 --> 02:14:56.170
She's real!

02:14:59.215 --> 02:15:02.384
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

02:15:03.553 --> 02:15:05.179
What's happening?

02:15:06.139 --> 02:15:07.806
What's happening?

02:15:12.145 --> 02:15:13.312
Grace!

02:15:14.022 --> 02:15:15.189
Grace!

02:15:17.275 --> 02:15:18.901
What's happening?

02:15:25.158 --> 02:15:26.575
Did it work?

02:15:32.248 --> 02:15:36.335
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

02:15:38.004 --> 02:15:39.755
She is with Eywa now.

02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:16.208
With your permission, I will speak now.

02:16:18.586 --> 02:16:21.046
You would honor me by translating.

02:16:28.138 --> 02:16:30.347
The Sky People have sent us a message

02:16:33.726 --> 02:16:36.145
that they can take whatever they want

02:16:37.939 --> 02:16:39.731
and no one can stop them.

02:16:43.318 --> 02:16:45.111
Well, we will send them a message.

02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:50.075
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

02:16:53.370 --> 02:16:55.746
You tell the other clans to come.

02:16:58.877 --> 02:17:01.378
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

02:17:03.590 --> 02:17:06.383
And you fly now with me!

02:17:07.427 --> 02:17:09.928
My brothers! Sisters!

02:17:11.013 --> 02:17:13.098
And we will show the Sky People

02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:15.976
that they cannot take whatever they want,

02:17:17.477 --> 02:17:18.937
and that this,

02:17:19.647 --> 02:17:20.689
this is our land!

02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:29.239
Yah!

02:17:44.339 --> 02:17:45.755
Yah!

02:18:15.161 --> 02:18:16.536
Yah!

02:18:34.055 --> 02:18:35.555
We rode out to the four winds.

02:18:38.308 --> 02:18:40.727
To the horse clans of the plain.

02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:44.731
Back to the stars!

02:18:44.816 --> 02:18:47.066
To the ikran people ofthe Eastern Sea.

02:18:47.067 --> 02:18:48.360
For our children's children!

02:18:48.443 --> 02:18:51.029
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

02:18:54.867 --> 02:18:56.243
Yah!

02:19:32.405 --> 02:19:34.906
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

02:19:34.991 --> 02:19:36.825
is fighting for survival.

02:19:36.909 --> 02:19:38.410
That's a fact!

02:19:39.245 --> 02:19:42.998
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

02:19:44.083 --> 02:19:47.960
Now, these orbital images tell me

02:19:48.379 --> 02:19:51.631
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

02:19:51.632 --> 02:19:54.217
to well over 2,000 in one day.

02:19:54.761 --> 02:19:56.762
And more are pouring in.

02:19:59.223 --> 02:20:02.642
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

02:20:02.727 --> 02:20:05.103
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

02:20:05.104 --> 02:20:07.356
Well, that's not gonna happen!

02:20:08.941 --> 02:20:12.611
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

02:20:12.612 --> 02:20:15.030
We will fight terror with terror.

02:20:19.327 --> 02:20:23.497
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

02:20:23.581 --> 02:20:27.417
is protected by their...
Their deity.

02:20:28.711 --> 02:20:30.837
And when we destroy it,

02:20:30.838 --> 02:20:33.215
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

02:20:33.299 --> 02:20:36.802
that they won't come within 1,000
klicks of this place ever again.

02:20:36.886 --> 02:20:39.596
And that, too, is a fact.

02:20:40.306 --> 02:20:42.057
Yeah! Yeah.

02:20:52.527 --> 02:20:54.496
Jake, it's crazy here.
It's full mobilization.

02:20:54.509 --> 02:20:56.488
They're rigging the
shuttle as a bomber.

02:20:56.572 --> 02:20:58.824
They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives.

02:20:58.908 --> 02:21:01.827
It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign.

02:21:01.911 --> 02:21:03.829
Fricking daisy cutters!

02:21:05.331 --> 02:21:08.166
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

02:21:08.251 --> 02:21:10.335
- When?
- 0600 tomorrow.

02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:12.295
- Max! Max!
- I gotta go.

02:21:14.173 --> 02:21:15.674
We're screwed!

02:21:17.135 --> 02:21:19.386
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

02:21:19.387 --> 02:21:21.638
that didn't involve martyrdom.

02:21:23.099 --> 02:21:26.476
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.523
I have 15 clans out there.

02:21:32.191 --> 02:21:34.317
That's over 2,000 warriors.

02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:40.282
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

02:21:41.325 --> 02:21:45.370
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

02:21:45.872 --> 02:21:47.372
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

02:21:47.457 --> 02:21:51.710
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

02:21:53.588 --> 02:21:57.048
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

02:21:57.133 --> 02:21:58.383
Yeah, I know.

02:21:58.384 --> 02:22:00.927
If they get to the Tree
of Souls, it's over.

02:22:01.012 --> 02:22:04.222
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

02:22:05.016 --> 02:22:07.058
It'll destroy them.

02:22:07.059 --> 02:22:09.519
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

02:22:24.577 --> 02:22:27.579
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

02:22:29.999 --> 02:22:34.753
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

02:22:37.298 --> 02:22:41.718
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

02:22:42.970 --> 02:22:45.096
See the world we come from.

02:22:46.182 --> 02:22:48.099
There's no green there.

02:22:49.477 --> 02:22:51.478
They killed their Mother.

02:22:52.271 --> 02:22:54.773
And they're gonna do the same here.

02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:58.985
More Sky People are gonna come.

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:02.113
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

02:23:03.407 --> 02:23:05.158
Unless we stop them.

02:23:07.745 --> 02:23:10.830
Look, you chose me for something.

02:23:12.291 --> 02:23:14.167
I will stand and fight.

02:23:15.211 --> 02:23:16.795
You know I will.

02:23:19.298 --> 02:23:21.550
But I need a little help here.

02:23:27.682 --> 02:23:30.725
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:35.981
She protects only the balance of life.

02:23:47.785 --> 02:23:49.494
It was worth a try.

02:24:20.192 --> 02:24:22.235
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

02:24:22.236 --> 02:24:25.614
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:41.087
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.

02:24:41.464 --> 02:24:45.050
- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode.

02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:21.836
This is Papa Dragon.

02:25:21.921 --> 02:25:25.006
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

02:25:32.515 --> 02:25:36.267
- Suit Team, go.
- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

02:25:46.821 --> 02:25:48.446
Move, move, move!

02:25:54.078 --> 02:25:55.870
Bravo 1-1, move left.

02:25:56.414 --> 02:25:59.833
Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.

02:26:02.169 --> 02:26:05.797
- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that.

02:26:05.798 --> 02:26:08.216
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:09.676
Copy that. Over.

02:26:09.677 --> 02:26:14.389
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

02:26:14.974 --> 02:26:18.351
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target.

02:26:18.352 --> 02:26:20.812
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

02:26:25.901 --> 02:26:28.445
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

02:26:29.405 --> 02:26:32.031
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

02:26:32.158 --> 02:26:35.076
Make no mistake, people,
they're out there.

02:26:36.662 --> 02:26:39.914
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

02:26:39.999 --> 02:26:42.208
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

02:26:42.334 --> 02:26:44.836
- Copy. Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

02:26:45.629 --> 02:26:47.839
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

02:26:50.092 --> 02:26:51.176
Hold!

02:26:59.185 --> 02:27:01.227
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.

02:27:01.312 --> 02:27:02.729
- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up.

02:27:02.813 --> 02:27:06.983
- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1, hold position.

02:27:13.073 --> 02:27:16.075
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

02:27:16.076 --> 02:27:18.661
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
- Firing line!

02:27:19.038 --> 02:27:21.748
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

02:27:22.458 --> 02:27:25.210
- Can't you clean it up?
- No, sir. It's the Flux.

02:27:53.489 --> 02:27:56.157
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

02:28:37.908 --> 02:28:40.660
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

02:28:41.787 --> 02:28:42.996
Break right. Come around.

02:28:46.542 --> 02:28:48.042
Light them up!

02:28:55.676 --> 02:28:57.886
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

02:29:05.144 --> 02:29:07.020
Yeah! Get some!

02:29:46.018 --> 02:29:47.852
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

02:29:58.697 --> 02:30:00.490
Jake! Jake! You copy?

02:30:01.158 --> 02:30:03.868
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

02:30:03.869 --> 02:30:04.869
Copy. Get out of there.

02:30:10.042 --> 02:30:11.459
That's him. Get after him!

02:30:28.394 --> 02:30:29.894
Take him out!

02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:39.654
Light her up!

02:30:48.664 --> 02:30:50.081
Right there!

02:30:50.207 --> 02:30:52.458
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:54.419
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:55.503
Arming all pods.

02:31:01.218 --> 02:31:02.301
That's it!

02:31:32.958 --> 02:31:34.083
Seyzey!

02:32:38.023 --> 02:32:40.191
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

02:32:41.151 --> 02:32:42.568
Sorry, Jake.

02:32:59.586 --> 02:33:00.670
Fire.

02:33:18.772 --> 02:33:21.274
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

02:33:24.111 --> 02:33:25.778
Rogue One, you copy?

02:33:27.781 --> 02:33:28.948
Trudy!

02:33:39.835 --> 02:33:41.127
Time to target, two minutes.

02:33:41.461 --> 02:33:43.880
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

02:33:43.964 --> 02:33:46.132
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

02:33:51.972 --> 02:33:55.808
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!

02:33:57.185 --> 02:33:58.436
Ma Jake!

02:34:00.355 --> 02:34:01.522
I read you.

02:34:10.657 --> 02:34:12.658
- Neytiri!
- Seyzey's dead.

02:34:13.243 --> 02:34:15.745
They are very close. They are many.

02:34:17.164 --> 02:34:18.664
Do not attack.

02:34:19.249 --> 02:34:21.208
Do you read me, Neytiri?

02:34:23.795 --> 02:34:25.087
Do not attack!

02:34:25.422 --> 02:34:28.591
Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!

02:34:36.683 --> 02:34:37.892
Neytiri!

02:34:39.978 --> 02:34:41.896
I got movement, I got movement.

02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:44.231
Hold position. Something's coming.

02:34:44.316 --> 02:34:46.108
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over.

02:34:46.193 --> 02:34:48.402
- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation.

02:34:48.403 --> 02:34:50.154
- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks.

02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:56.786
Hundred meters and closing fast.

02:35:13.345 --> 02:35:14.929
We gotta get out of here!

02:35:22.729 --> 02:35:24.438
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Move! Move! Move!

02:35:24.523 --> 02:35:26.941
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

02:35:34.074 --> 02:35:36.742
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:45.459
Eywa has heard you!

02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:57.430
Come on!

02:36:09.693 --> 02:36:11.569
Fall back! Move! Move!

02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:38.763
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

02:36:38.764 --> 02:36:42.892
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

02:36:42.976 --> 02:36:45.895
- Press to target.
- Copy. Pressing to target.

02:36:45.896 --> 02:36:47.938
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:10.252
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

02:37:10.253 --> 02:37:12.588
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

02:37:12.589 --> 02:37:13.910
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

02:37:46.748 --> 02:37:47.915
Brace!

02:38:04.933 --> 02:38:06.308
It's Sully.

02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:22.283
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

02:41:06.656 --> 02:41:08.532
Come on. Come to papa.

02:41:35.977 --> 02:41:37.770
Give it up, Quaritch!

02:41:40.815 --> 02:41:42.316
It's all over.

02:41:43.568 --> 02:41:46.111
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

02:41:46.112 --> 02:41:48.405
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

02:42:44.546 --> 02:42:45.796
Come on!

02:43:01.646 --> 02:43:05.774
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

02:43:10.405 --> 02:43:12.614
You think you're one of them?

02:43:13.825 --> 02:43:15.492
Time to wake up.

02:44:59.681 --> 02:45:00.764
Jake?

02:45:14.445 --> 02:45:15.570
Jake.

02:45:33.548 --> 02:45:34.965
Jake.

02:45:50.982 --> 02:45:52.983
Jake! Ma Jake!

02:46:34.650 --> 02:46:35.984
I See you.

02:46:41.574 --> 02:46:42.908
I See you.

02:47:08.017 --> 02:47:09.226
I See you, Brother.

02:47:10.436 --> 02:47:11.645
Are The People safe?

02:47:14.482 --> 02:47:15.607
They're safe.

02:47:22.115 --> 02:47:23.615
I can't...

02:47:24.784 --> 02:47:27.035
I cannot lead The People.

02:47:27.578 --> 02:47:29.913
You must lead them... Jakesully.

02:47:31.290 --> 02:47:33.208
I'm not officer material.

02:47:33.292 --> 02:47:35.043
It is decided.

02:47:38.381 --> 02:47:39.589
Now...

02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:43.218
do the duty of Olo'eyktan.

02:47:47.807 --> 02:47:49.474
I will not kill you.

02:47:49.517 --> 02:47:51.143
It is the way!

02:47:53.479 --> 02:47:55.063
And it is good.

02:47:57.316 --> 02:47:59.151
I will be remembered.

02:48:01.779 --> 02:48:05.824
I fought... with Toruk Macto!

02:48:08.327 --> 02:48:10.203
And we were brothers.

02:48:11.622 --> 02:48:15.709
And he... was my last shadow.

02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:04.966
The aliens went back to their dying world.

02:49:07.136 --> 02:49:10.055
Only a few were chosen to stay.

02:49:22.276 --> 02:49:24.819
The time of great sorrow was ending.
