WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.223
The people who eat here
are animals.

00:06.267 --> 00:09.183
And not like those cute otters
holding hands.

00:09.226 --> 00:11.750
I hate 'em all.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.752
I went over to check
on a table and this man

00:13.796 --> 00:16.625
wiped gloppy short rib sauce
on my shirt.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.105
Do I look like a napkin?

00:18.148 --> 00:20.933
Well, you do now.

00:20.977 --> 00:24.894
And by the way, that "gloppy
sauce" is a port wine reduction,

00:24.937 --> 00:28.289
and intentionally viscous.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.683
Ugh.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.121
I came out here for fresh air,
but that dream is dead.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.906
Let me toss it on the pile
with all your others.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.995
I doubt you can throw that high.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.084
It sounds like you need

00:41.128 --> 00:43.260
a delicious
and calming cigarette.

00:43.304 --> 00:44.827
I don't smoke.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.612
In the words of the great
'80s poet Adam Ant,

00:47.656 --> 00:50.050
"Don't drink, don't smoke,
what do you do?"

00:52.965 --> 00:56.143
Hey, dude, I used to smoke, I
used to drink, I used to strip,

00:56.186 --> 00:58.101
I used to not come home
for days at a time.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.495
Mm, so what you're saying
is you used to be fun.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.284
Fine. Give me one.

01:20.036 --> 01:22.212
Oh, right.

01:24.736 --> 01:27.435
Thanks, I owe you one.

01:27.478 --> 01:30.046
Great. You want to come over
to my place after we close,

01:30.090 --> 01:31.874
"get chummy"?

01:31.917 --> 01:35.095
It's tobacco, not ecstasy.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.053
Would you like some ecstasy?

01:41.492 --> 01:43.407
â™ª

02:06.213 --> 02:08.171
Why do we bother putting
the damn chairs away?

02:08.215 --> 02:10.347
We're just gonna have
another meeting tomorrow.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.567
There's ladies' Zumba
in the morning.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.134
What is that,
like a Kegel thing?

02:14.177 --> 02:16.527
Tightening the old hoo-ha?

02:16.571 --> 02:19.051
It's a dance-based
exercise class,

02:19.095 --> 02:21.228
but your la-la
does get a workout.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.839
Guys, we're all over 12.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.624
We can say "vagina."

02:26.668 --> 02:28.626
I did Zumba drunk once.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.628
Got kicked out.

02:30.672 --> 02:34.763
Maybe 'cause I kept
yelling "Zumba!"

02:34.806 --> 02:36.765
And I peed in my leotard.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.333
[phone chimes]

02:39.376 --> 02:40.899
Oh, my God.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.118
What?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.554
I just got a text from this guy

02:43.598 --> 02:45.730
I met at The Home Depot
yesterday.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.993
Wait, like, "met a guy"
met a guy?

02:48.037 --> 02:50.170
You didn't tell me that. Spill.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.693
Well, he works there.
I needed to get a light switch,

02:51.736 --> 02:53.216
but I wasn't sure if I needed

02:53.260 --> 02:55.610
a 20-amp
or if a 15-amp would cover it.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.002
So then I...Get to the man part.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.875
So Rick-- that's what
his lifting belt said--

02:59.918 --> 03:01.485
swooped in and said even

03:01.529 --> 03:03.270
if I only needed a 15,
a 20 should be fine.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.880
And then he pushed you up
against the wall and kissed you.

03:04.923 --> 03:07.665
Sorry, I just got to make
the story better.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.406
He asked for my number,
I didn't think he'd use it.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.669
Now he wants to know
"What's up?"

03:11.713 --> 03:13.584
How do I even respond to that?

03:13.628 --> 03:16.631
How about "Nothing much,
what's up with you?"

03:16.674 --> 03:19.373
Are you nuts? You want
to sound busy, in demand.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.679
Tell him you're at a gala.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.681
No, wait.
You met him at Home Depot.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.335
Tell him
you're at a county fair.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.381
Personally, I don't think

03:27.424 --> 03:29.339
you should start
a relationship off on a lie.

03:29.383 --> 03:30.558
Go with "not much."

03:34.562 --> 03:37.478
Oh, man, which tiny blonde
should I believe?

03:37.521 --> 03:40.742
Well, Christy's my daughter
and I love her,

03:40.785 --> 03:42.787
but if you want any hope of
a romantic life, listen to Jill.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.833
"At a fair."

03:44.876 --> 03:46.704
Hey, I date.

03:46.748 --> 03:50.012
You do. Not recently,
but you do.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.796
[phone chimes]

03:51.840 --> 03:53.929
Whoa, he texted back already.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.410
And he asked me out on a date!
"Anytime..."

03:56.453 --> 03:59.935
No, no, no. You're eating funnel
cake at a fair, remember?

03:59.978 --> 04:01.545
Yeah, you're not just staring

04:01.589 --> 04:03.286
at your phone like
some kind of Christy.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.071
I don't do that.

04:06.115 --> 04:09.945
I blame myself. It's why I'm
trying to do better with Tammy.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.164
Marjorie, everyone's
picking on me.I know,

04:12.208 --> 04:15.167
and the fact that they're right
doesn't justify it.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.952
You know what?

04:16.995 --> 04:19.563
My homework
is more fun than this.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.044
And yeah, that's a dig, guys.

04:22.087 --> 04:25.047
It's a dig.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.309
So when do I text him back?

04:26.353 --> 04:27.658
I'll let you know.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.447
Sharon.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.404
Oh, hey, Christy.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.014
Can I bum one of those?

04:36.058 --> 04:38.147
Sure. I didn't know
you were a smoker.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.714
Only on Wednesdays.

04:39.757 --> 04:40.976
It's Thursday.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.630
Just light the cigarette,
Sharon.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.462
Thank you.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.770
I'm just gonna go smoke this
behind that bush.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.560
I'll see you over there.

04:59.603 --> 05:00.952
MARJORIE:
Yeah.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.483
Now.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.444
Morons.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.625
Hi, can I have ten
dollars on pump three?

05:21.669 --> 05:22.844
You got it.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.064
Actually,

05:26.108 --> 05:27.718
can I have five dollars
on pump three

05:27.762 --> 05:29.285
and a pack of the lights?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.156
Those are nine dollars.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.333
Really? Wow.
[laughs softly]

05:35.813 --> 05:38.642
Okay, give me one dollar on pump
three and a pack of the lights.

05:53.004 --> 05:56.051
I don't like that Tammy's date
is picking her up here.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.923
Now if he's a murderer,
he knows where she lives.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.969
That's the third time
you've mentioned

06:01.012 --> 06:03.406
that she might
get killed on this date.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.974
Where is all this
murder anxiety coming from?

06:06.017 --> 06:08.411
From being a
woman, Marjorie.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.891
JILL:
Okay!

06:09.934 --> 06:13.329
Get ready. Tammy, come on out,
and show them what you got.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.679
[gasping]Ooh!
Wow!

06:17.289 --> 06:20.945
I know, right?
I'm a piece.

06:20.989 --> 06:24.471
I'm so nervous, first date out
of prison, first date sober.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.647
It's just like going on a date
drunk, only much, much scarier.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.213
'Cause you're
a woman.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.085
You'll be great.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.000
What if he orders a cocktail
and asks me if I want one?

06:32.043 --> 06:33.436
What do I say then?

06:33.480 --> 06:35.046
You don't have to tell
your whole story.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.309
Just say you don't feel
like drinking tonight.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.746
Or tell him you can't drink

06:38.789 --> 06:40.008
'cause you're taking
antibiotics.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.879
How is that gonna work
if they keep dating?

06:41.923 --> 06:43.881
Yeah, then he'll think
she has some horrible STD

06:43.925 --> 06:46.101
that Western medicine
just can't knock out.

06:46.144 --> 06:49.321
But he won't know she's sober.

06:49.365 --> 06:52.324
Maybe you should stop focusing
on whether he's gonna like you

06:52.368 --> 06:54.457
and see if you even like him.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.285
You're Tammy
frickin' Diffendorf.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.156
You are beautiful and fierce

06:58.200 --> 07:00.463
and he's lucky
you're even going out with him.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.509
[laughs]:
Wow!

07:02.552 --> 07:06.295
You guys just turned
my whole world around.

07:06.338 --> 07:09.820
I am going out on this date
with a blown mind.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.648
He's pulling up.It's happening!

07:11.692 --> 07:14.172
Okay, when he knocks...Out of my way!

07:21.832 --> 07:23.660
Are we still worried
about him,Wendy?

07:29.231 --> 07:31.276
Well, well, well.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.238
Look who's here
to bum another cigarette.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.413
I have my own.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.198
Ooh, your own pack.
That was fast.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.679
I still only smoke
once in a while,

07:42.723 --> 07:44.464
I just don't want
to be seen as needy.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.466
Mm. I think with that voice
and those eyes,

07:46.509 --> 07:48.772
that's always gonna
be a problem.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.992
I can take care of myself.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.778
[groans]

07:54.822 --> 07:56.388
Oh, Christy,

07:56.432 --> 07:57.694
face it.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.304
You're a real smoker,

07:59.348 --> 08:02.699
and a real smoker should
have her own lighter.

08:02.743 --> 08:03.961
This was my father's.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.183
And now it's yours.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.793
Seriously?

08:09.837 --> 08:12.796
No, I got it from a busboy.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.625
Although it was hisfather's.

08:18.323 --> 08:21.544
TV HOST: What started out
as dinner and a movie

08:21.588 --> 08:25.722
ended as dinner and a murder.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.942
I'm getting scared.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.552
Marjorie, change the channel.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.859
Marjorie!

08:35.993 --> 08:36.864
Uh-oh.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.607
Uhp, there it is.

08:40.650 --> 08:44.088
What do you know,
I am gonna be sad when she goes.

08:44.132 --> 08:47.396
Tammy's back.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.441
Best date ever.

08:49.485 --> 08:52.575
Really?Oh! Marjorie,
wake up, she's home.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.446
I'm awake.

08:54.490 --> 08:57.362
Tell us everything.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.973
Well, I'm so lucky
you guys dressed me up,

08:59.016 --> 09:02.803
because he took me
to Olive Garden.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.805
Okay, I've been watching those
commercials for seven years

09:04.848 --> 09:08.025
from prison and if anything,
they undersell it.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.549
What's he like?

09:09.592 --> 09:11.551
Oh, he's funny, he's smart--

09:11.594 --> 09:14.031
and get this, he doesn't drink.Is he an alcoholic?

09:14.075 --> 09:16.643
No, he has irritable
bowel syndrome.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.646
He sounds perfect.

09:19.689 --> 09:20.908
Doesn't he, Marjorie?

09:22.866 --> 09:25.608
Oh, Lord, let's at least
shut her mouth.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.922
Tape?
Anybody got any tape?

09:36.532 --> 09:38.099
Was there a good-night kiss?

09:38.142 --> 09:40.101
A lady doesn't
kiss and tell,

09:40.144 --> 09:41.798
but I'm no lady, so let me
tell you about the kissing.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.844
It was awesome!

09:43.887 --> 09:45.846
You know the kind of kiss
that leaves you light-headed?

09:45.889 --> 09:48.370
No.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.981
Look at you-- you went
on a date, you stayed sober,

09:51.025 --> 09:52.504
your clothes aren't inside out.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.332
You didn't bring
any of their breadsticks home

09:54.376 --> 09:56.813
for your friend Bonnie,
but otherwise, a success.

09:56.857 --> 09:57.727
That's what you think.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.337
[gasps]
What a night!

09:59.381 --> 10:01.165
I know!

10:01.209 --> 10:03.385
So when can I text him
to tell him I had fun?

10:03.428 --> 10:06.344
Never.
Wait for him to text you.But I want to.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.695
Go ahead. A little
"I had a good time" won't hurt.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.088
[gasps]
They're still warm.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.134
Thanks, Bonnie.
"Had a nice time.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.657
Can't wait to see you again."

10:14.701 --> 10:15.876
I guess that's okay.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.094
"I think you're the one."

10:17.138 --> 10:18.182
No!
No!
No!

10:19.923 --> 10:21.925
Oh. How'd it go?

10:33.241 --> 10:35.156
[phone rings]

10:39.682 --> 10:41.553
Hi, Jill.

10:41.597 --> 10:46.167
I'm almost there,
driving as fast as I can.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.472
Bye.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.758
[spraying]

11:38.567 --> 11:39.960
That was easy.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.747
I'm starving.
Can we please order?

11:44.791 --> 11:45.966
Aren't we gonna
wait for Christy?

11:46.009 --> 11:48.577
No, 'cause I get rude
when I'm hangry.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.057
We're ready,
we're ready!

11:50.100 --> 11:52.799
Oh, I am so gonna
get her fired.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.888
[scoffs] Why isn't Rick
texting me back?

11:54.931 --> 11:56.150
I'm gonna
text him again.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.673
Tammy, I wouldn't.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.154
You texted him four times
in the car on the way over here.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.677
How do I put this gently?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.287
That's something
Christy would do.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.811
I just really
like him,

12:04.854 --> 12:06.682
and I haven't liked
anyone in a long time.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.771
Which is great,
but just take it slow.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.078
Food!

12:11.121 --> 12:12.949
I think I have some
almonds in my purse.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.561
No.

12:16.605 --> 12:19.869
Maybe my phone is broken.
Will you just text me?

12:19.913 --> 12:21.741
No, you're obsessed
with this guy.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.786
"This guy"? His name
is Rick something

12:23.830 --> 12:25.832
and he means
a lot to me.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.095
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

12:28.138 --> 12:31.968
Traffic. What is
happening to Napa?

12:32.012 --> 12:33.796
Have you been smoking?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.667
Why would you
ask me that?

12:35.711 --> 12:37.800
Because you smell like
mouth wash, air freshener,

12:37.844 --> 12:40.020
Purell and
dryer sheets.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.065
It's like sitting next to
a freshly cleaned motel room.

12:42.109 --> 12:45.721
I'm not smoking.
Did we order yet?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.854
No, 'cause this is hell.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.770
Why do you have a lighter?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.336
Why are you going
through my purse?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.251
I'm your mother.What does that
have to do with it?

12:54.295 --> 12:57.167
You came out of my pocketbook,
I get to rifle through yours.

12:59.996 --> 13:04.087
[scoffs]
Okay, yes, I'm smoking,

13:04.131 --> 13:06.394
but I'm not drinking,
I'm not gambling,

13:06.437 --> 13:07.787
I'm not sleeping
with married men.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.266
Let me have this.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.225
[phone chimes][gasps] It's him!

13:11.268 --> 13:13.749
Shoot, Amber Alert.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.579
White pickup, Utah plates.
Keep your eyes open.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.147
Tammy, stop with the phone.
You're driving yourself crazy.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.802
You're driving us all crazy.
You're acting pathetic.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.587
[phone chimes]

13:25.630 --> 13:29.330
Not him, but, yes, Wendy,
Bonnie was a little harsh.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.814
Not out loud. You trying
to get me killed?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.816
[mouths]

13:38.208 --> 13:40.863
Hi, I'd like to make
an order for delivery.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.735
Yeah, my address is the booth
with the woman waving.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.611
[upbeat music playing]

13:53.528 --> 13:55.182
[knocking on door]

13:56.748 --> 13:58.489
[music stops]

13:58.533 --> 14:00.013
Yeah?

14:00.056 --> 14:03.668
Hey, Bonnie,
what's happening?

14:03.712 --> 14:05.714
What is happening?

14:08.021 --> 14:10.327
You gals talking about Zumba

14:10.371 --> 14:13.722
inspired me to get out
my old Jazzercise tapes.

14:13.765 --> 14:17.987
There's a lot to mock here,
but I need your advice.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.684
This thing with Tammy
is driving me...

14:21.034 --> 14:23.775
Okay, we need to lose this.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.777
I just don't know what to do.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.910
She's gonna get her heart broken
and I'm worried about her.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.956
[chuckles]
What?

14:29.999 --> 14:32.175
I'm taking a moment
to enjoy

14:32.219 --> 14:34.612
that you're worrying about
somebody other than yourself.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.180
You've really changed.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.704
Oh. Thank you.

14:39.748 --> 14:43.795
You can have this back.
It's actually kind of wet.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.972
Okay, here's the deal,

14:46.015 --> 14:47.103
I know what's
best for Tammy.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.192
How do I get her
to listen to me?

14:49.236 --> 14:51.499
You don't know what's best
for her, Bonnie.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.849
She has to have
her own experiences.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.418
The only thing you can do
is share yours, if she asks.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.985
But she's not asking.Well, then shut up.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.988
You shut up.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.990
Sorry, you were saying?

15:04.033 --> 15:05.992
You know, when you
started dating Adam,

15:06.035 --> 15:08.037
I thought you were
making a big mistake.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.647
What's wrong with Adam?

15:09.691 --> 15:12.041
Well, I just didn't like him,

15:12.085 --> 15:13.651
and I didn't think
you were ready,

15:13.695 --> 15:15.436
but you proved me wrong
because you are

15:15.479 --> 15:17.960
handling this relationship
so beautifully.

15:18.004 --> 15:22.095
Thank you. What exactly
didn't you like about him?

15:22.138 --> 15:26.229
Well, he had a certain swagger
I didn't appreciate,

15:26.273 --> 15:29.711
and apparently, before you,
he was a bit of a tomcat.

15:29.754 --> 15:34.063
"Swagger"? That's a great way
to put it. So arrogant.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.022
My point is, I was wrong.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.588
I'm not sure you were.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.329
We're running into
ex-girlfriends all the time.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.027
Bonnie, listen...Williams-Sonoma,

15:41.070 --> 15:43.638
I am buying nice plates
for the first time in my life,

15:43.681 --> 15:44.987
and who's wrapping them up?

15:45.031 --> 15:47.207
Jaqueline with her big,
fake fingernails.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.210
Why didn't you
tell me this back then?

15:50.253 --> 15:53.300
You didn't ask for my opinion,

15:53.343 --> 15:55.519
like Tammy hasn't
asked for yours.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.869
Fine, fine, got it.

15:57.913 --> 16:01.308
Okay. Now if you don't mind,

16:01.351 --> 16:03.397
I would like to go back
to Jazzercise.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.486
Would you like
to join me?

16:05.529 --> 16:09.620
I would not, but I
definitely want to watch.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.100
[upbeat music plays]

16:21.545 --> 16:23.025
Hi.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.245
Hi.You okay?

16:25.288 --> 16:28.291
Uh, yeah, I just pulled
a muscle Jazzercising.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.774
By the way, your ass
appears to be on fire.

16:32.817 --> 16:37.170
Fine, caught me.
Cue the lecture.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.345
No lecture.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.650
Oh, come on, you don't think

16:39.694 --> 16:40.825
this is self-destructive
behavior?

16:40.869 --> 16:42.392
Oh, honey,

16:42.436 --> 16:45.656
I get it. I went
through the whole

16:45.700 --> 16:48.616
"finding ways to be naughty
in sobriety" thing.

16:48.659 --> 16:52.315
In fact, when I had
about five years,

16:52.359 --> 16:55.057
I developed a massive
crush on Marvin,

16:55.101 --> 16:57.233
the guy that I had
the coffee commitment with.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.408
Ooh.

16:58.452 --> 17:02.064
No, not "ooh."
He was married and so was I.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.501
Ooh.
Yeah.

17:04.545 --> 17:07.026
All we did
was flirt, but...

17:07.069 --> 17:09.158
it did give me a thrill,

17:09.202 --> 17:11.465
and at the time,
I really needed that.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.162
So what happened?

17:13.206 --> 17:15.469
Oh, I kept working
the program, and so did he,

17:15.512 --> 17:19.255
and we got better
and the flirting stopped.

17:19.299 --> 17:22.258
Also, one night
he wore a denim vest.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.394
Well, my Marvin and I
are still flirting.

17:27.437 --> 17:31.050
[chuckles] Okay.
I'll see you inside.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.620
[grunting]

17:36.664 --> 17:39.101
What was I
trying to prove?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.416
[phone ringing]Hi, Bonnie.

17:49.459 --> 17:52.506
Hi, Tammy.

17:52.549 --> 17:56.075
I'm calling 'cause
I owe you an apology.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.815
I was too hard on you.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.295
You're not pathetic

17:59.339 --> 18:02.342
and I was wrong to say
you were obsessing about Rick.

18:02.385 --> 18:05.823
Thanks, Big Sauce, that means
a lot. You're forgiven.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.348
Good. So what are you up to?

18:08.391 --> 18:10.306
I'm sitting across the street
from Rick's house.

18:13.353 --> 18:14.615
Are you?

18:14.658 --> 18:17.444
And I may have binoculars.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.446
Uh-huh.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.926
Am I as crazy as I feel?

18:21.970 --> 18:24.407
Are you asking my opinion?I am.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.585
Where are you exactly?

18:33.286 --> 18:35.636
You took an Uber
to stalk a guy?

18:35.679 --> 18:37.507
You know I don't drive.

18:37.551 --> 18:40.597
Bonnie, Yuri. Yuri, Bonnie.Good evening.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.469
Uh, would you like to have
mint, water, phone charger?

18:42.512 --> 18:43.774
I'm fine.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.995
Why are you doing this?
Eh, as long as I'm here.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.301
I still hadn't
heard from Rick,

18:48.344 --> 18:50.172
so I went to Home Depot
to say hi,

18:50.216 --> 18:52.522
and he walks away and says
he has to do something

18:52.566 --> 18:54.611
in aisle three, so I
follow him to aisle three

18:54.655 --> 18:56.439
and he's not doing anything.
So I say to him,

18:56.483 --> 18:57.788
"You're not
doing anything,"

18:57.832 --> 18:59.616
and he says,
"I can't talk right now.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.836
I'll call you later
when I get home."

19:01.879 --> 19:05.231
Six hours go by, no call,
so I came to see if he's home.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.494
He's home!

19:07.537 --> 19:10.453
He can clearly be seen
eating pizza in his boxers.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.063
So what do I do?

19:12.107 --> 19:14.849
In my experience,

19:14.892 --> 19:17.808
if a guy would rather
eat alone in his underwear,

19:17.852 --> 19:19.636
he's not interested.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.204
I know.
You do?

19:22.248 --> 19:25.251
I just didn't want
to admit it to myself.

19:25.294 --> 19:28.776
Tissues are in pocket
in front of you.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.387
[crying]: I'm gonna be single
the rest of my life.

19:31.431 --> 19:34.434
No, you're not.
I have done way worse than this.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.262
Sitting outside
his house?

19:36.305 --> 19:37.350
Try moving
into his attic

19:37.393 --> 19:38.916
without him knowing
for three weeks.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.918
You didn't
really do that.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.356
Sure did. There was a website
warning people about me.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.794
But now I'm
getting married,

19:46.837 --> 19:48.839
and I'm not as crazy
as I used to be,

19:48.883 --> 19:51.538
and I found a guy who loves
the crazy that's still there.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.148
You're gonna learn from this,
and next time,

19:53.192 --> 19:54.410
you'll do it
differently.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.499
[scoffs] If there
ever is a next time.

19:56.543 --> 19:58.936
It may not happen right away,
but it will happen.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.072
I think you've waited
long enough.

20:04.115 --> 20:07.815
May I take you
for dinner sometime?

20:07.858 --> 20:11.471
I'd love that. Let's go now!
Bonnie, out!

20:11.514 --> 20:13.951
Hey, can we go to Olive Garden?No problem.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.577
You don't do anything
halfway, do you?

20:30.620 --> 20:32.840
Are you gonna smoke with me
or just judge?

20:32.883 --> 20:35.756
No, thanks, I quit.How?

20:35.799 --> 20:39.150
I just stopped.
It's called having character.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.935
Have fun out here.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.198
I will!

20:45.331 --> 20:46.810
[thunderclap]

20:50.727 --> 20:53.469
Oh...

20:53.513 --> 20:55.297
Oh, come on!
