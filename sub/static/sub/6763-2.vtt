01:32.920 --> 01:36.390
<i>Dr, Connor,</i>
<i>Emergency Room 1 stat,</i>

01:38.400 --> 01:41.915
There were hundreds of babies born
in Los Angeles County two days ago.

01:42.080 --> 01:46.119
Black babies, white babies,
big babies and small babies,

01:46.280 --> 01:47.759
but only one baby's so special

01:47.920 --> 01:50.150
that she'll go through life
with the name--

01:50.320 --> 01:52.595
Damn it, lady, get out of there.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.195
The nurse ruined my shot again.
l gotta do it one more time.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.555
David, visiting hours
were over an hour ago.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.280
Mel and Jackie are gonna be
bringing it home first thing tomorrow.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.351
lt's not like you're not gonna
get another chance

02:03.520 --> 02:05.750
to see it pooping and drooling
for the rest of its life.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.276
Don't worry, Erin. Your sister's just
jealous because you're so gorgeous.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.670
l didn't say you weren't gorgeous.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.639
The truth is at this point the only way
anybody can tell it's a girl

02:15.800 --> 02:17.438
is because they wrap her
in a pink blanket.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.518
l got news for you, Kel. That's not
the only way they can tell it's a girl.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.238
You are so disgusting.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.190
See you at home, kiddo.
Welcome to the world.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.675
She's ungrateful. She's deceitful.
She's irrational.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.751
What we've got here
is a manipulative little girl

02:37.920 --> 02:39.433
who is spoiled rotten to the core.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.556
l can't listen to this anymore.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.474
Honey, l don't blame you.
lf anything, l blame myself.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.632
All those years,
she was daddy's little bunny fish.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.677
Whatever Brenda want, Brenda got.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.308
Kisses and hugs.
No questions asked.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.516
No wonder she has no respect
for parental authority.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.830
She's out of control.
Out of control.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.833
No, Jim, she is in perfect control.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.231
And she's been ever since you decided
to go to war with Dylan McKay.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.799
Are you forgetting how many times

03:05.960 --> 03:08.155
she has blatantly lied to us
in the last six weeks?

03:08.320 --> 03:10.231
Of course not.
But stomping around the house,

03:10.400 --> 03:12.311
threatening to use
the full extent of the law,

03:12.480 --> 03:14.391
that's not gonna bring
our family back together.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.357
l just can't sit back and do nothing

03:16.520 --> 03:18.476
knowing that she's shacked up
with that guy.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.510
Honey, l know how you feel.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.591
What do you propose we do about it?

03:24.760 --> 03:26.796
Lock her in a chastity belt,
keep her in her room

03:26.960 --> 03:28.552
until we're ready
to become grandparents?

03:29.280 --> 03:30.349
For starters.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.355
Oh, l haven't slept in two days.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.112
Look.

03:37.320 --> 03:40.437
Why don't we just hold out
for another day or two

03:40.600 --> 03:42.318
and see what happens.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.674
And if that doesn't work?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.392
Then we wring her neck.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.233
l'm going out.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.435
What?

03:58.240 --> 03:59.832
Would you turn off
the vacuum cleaner?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.070
l can't hear you.
Let me turn off the vacuum cleaner.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.674
Sorry. What were you saying?

04:05.840 --> 04:09.230
Bren, l appreciate you cleaning up
around here, l really do.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.118
But could you wait until l'm gone?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.517
Sure. Are you going to the beach?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.233
Yeah, maybe.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.392
- When do you think you'll be back?
- Tonight. Don't worry about it.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.548
l'm not worried.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.075
lt's just that l don't know
if you want me to fix dinner.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.477
lt's a little hard
to start thinking about dinner

04:25.640 --> 04:26.959
when you haven't had
breakfast yet.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.838
Sorry. Do you want me
to fix you something?

04:29.000 --> 04:33.437
- Some eggs? Toast? Cereal?
- Bren, l'm not hungry, okay?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.914
Hey, l'm sorry.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.674
Even on good days,
l can be a bear in the morning.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.149
But l do love you, you know that?

04:47.200 --> 04:50.078
You better not be saying that
just to make me feel better.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.276
l'll be back tonight.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.910
We are in desperate need
of some laundry detergent.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.675
Can you pick some up at the market
on your way back, please?

04:59.840 --> 05:00.955
No problem.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.429
And while you're at the store,
get something for dinner.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.239
Some fish, chicken,
whatever you want. Doesn't matter.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.958
l'll be here. Have a nice day.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.877
They stuck you with
a temperamental chair, huh?

05:36.040 --> 05:37.792
Yeah, you'd think
the Beverly Hills Beach Club

05:37.960 --> 05:39.075
could afford one that works.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.909
No. That'd be too easy.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.753
This puppy's worthless,
but if you go over there,

05:50.920 --> 05:53.992
l think you'll find what l truly believe
is the best spot on the beach.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.639
Really? Why is it so good?

05:55.800 --> 05:57.756
Well, great breeze off the ocean,

05:57.920 --> 06:01.310
rays all day, and it just happens
to be right next to where l'm sitting.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.352
- l'm Steve Sanders.
- Hi, Steve.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.999
- l'm Rory.
- Yes, you are.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.870
This is so weird.
This is just like nostalgia.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.634
l mean, this is our very last
farewell-to-the-Beach-Club burger.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.870
Donna, we're not leaving
for three days.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.110
l know, l just have
so much packing to do.

06:21.320 --> 06:23.117
You haven't packed yet?

06:23.320 --> 06:25.072
Maybe l shouldn't be going.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.673
Donna, are you getting cold
feet again?

06:26.840 --> 06:28.398
Kelly, l don't even speak French.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.755
So you'll take a dictionary.
lt's no big deal.

06:30.920 --> 06:34.356
l gotta agree. Studying in Paris
for six weeks is a <i>tres</i> cool concept.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.956
l know, l'm just gonna miss you
so much.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.155
Excuse me.
Are Brenda and her parents

06:47.320 --> 06:48.469
back on speaking terms yet?

06:48.640 --> 06:49.789
Hardly. Why?

06:51.440 --> 06:53.510
- Hello, Mrs. Walsh.
- Congratulations.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.829
Oh, thank you.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.355
So, what's it like having
a new little person around?

06:57.520 --> 06:59.556
- Great.
- lt's pretty cool.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.472
l think we'll let her stay around
for a while.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.154
- How's your mom doing?
- Well, she's tired.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.356
But then l guess you know
what it's like having kids.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.110
Yes. ln fact, l do.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.831
Listen, have any of you
seen Brandon?

07:13.760 --> 07:15.239
No.

07:15.880 --> 07:19.316
Excuse me, they said somebody
got locked out of their cabana?

07:20.480 --> 07:24.155
- l think l'll die of embarrassment now.
- Oh, the shame of it.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.672
Can you ever forgive me?

07:27.400 --> 07:30.472
lt'll be tough.
But l think l can rise to the occasion.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.837
Steve, wanna hear
a poem l just wrote?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.639
- Do l have a choice?
- Nope. Here it is:

07:41.800 --> 07:44.314
<i>Don't look now,</i>
<i>The summer has begun,</i>

07:44.480 --> 07:47.040
<i>The babes have landed,</i>
<i>And guess who just landed one?</i>

07:47.680 --> 07:50.399
All right.
Stud mania out of control.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.471
Well, guess who else met
a girl today?

07:52.640 --> 07:53.993
You?

07:54.160 --> 07:56.549
- Earthquake material.
- Must be contagious.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.472
l hope not.
l'm going out with her tonight.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.471
- You work fast.
- Well, l've got to.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.393
- She's only in L.A. for a week.
- Mine to. She's going back to Florida.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.596
She's here visiting her Aunt Betty
in Brentwood.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.271
ls that the girl you asked out?

08:10.720 --> 08:12.039
Yeah.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.518
- Me too.
- No.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.636
- Yes.
- Steve, now settle.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.233
Brandon, l met her first.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.995
Steve, it's customary in America
for women to have some sort of say

08:22.160 --> 08:24.799
over who they're gonna
go out with, is it not?

08:25.640 --> 08:27.198
Fine. She's yours.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.351
- You go out with her.
- Steve, what's your problem?

08:29.520 --> 08:31.351
l'm not gonna compete with you
over a girl.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.909
l've been down that road before.
She's gonna say--

08:34.080 --> 08:37.277
Hey, Steve, how you doing?
See you in a couple of hours.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.194
Twins? Could this be?

08:51.360 --> 08:52.918
Twins.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.953
You jerk.

08:55.120 --> 08:59.272
What can l say, man, other than
''wanna double-date?''

09:02.560 --> 09:03.549
Yeah.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.075
So the rage at camp is to come up
with these hip nicknames.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.630
We got Maya Papaya, Briana Banana,
Heather the Feather.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.995
So, what's your hip nickname?

09:12.160 --> 09:14.151
Andrea Schmandria.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.998
Lovely. So, what would mine be?
Like, ''Landon Brandon''?

09:19.160 --> 09:20.639
''Walsh rarebit.''

09:22.080 --> 09:23.559
Oh, yes.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.550
- Night, chief.
- Bye.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.915
- Mom?
- Oh, fancy meeting you here.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.069
Yeah.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.470
Guess l don't think of you and dad
as members yet, sorry.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.119
Well, that's okay. Neither do we.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.032
So when's dad finally gonna
show his ugly mug down here?

09:43.200 --> 09:46.476
Not until we find a way
to break this impasse with Brenda.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.039
Have you heard from her?

09:48.200 --> 09:50.111
No, but l think that's mostly because

09:50.280 --> 09:52.669
she doesn't want me
to get stuck in the middle of it again.

09:52.840 --> 09:53.955
l understand.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.953
l just wonder how she'd react
if you did get in touch with her.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.475
On your own, of course.
l'm just curious what she'd say.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.074
l don't know, Mom.
Want me to call her up and find out?

10:02.240 --> 10:04.549
Or you could go over there in person
to see how she's doing.

10:04.720 --> 10:05.994
l mean, if you want.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.355
And put myself
right back in the middle of it?

10:08.520 --> 10:13.913
l'm not asking you to spy on her,
Brandon, but something's gotta give.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.952
Mom, you know your tan sports sack,
the one you always travel with?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.109
l'm familiar with it.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.998
ls it okay if Donna borrows it
for the summer?

10:23.160 --> 10:25.196
Why not? l'm not going anywhere.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.636
lt's all set.
Okay, l'll bring it by tomorrow.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.196
Donna, stop worrying.
Everything will be okay.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.033
l love you too. Goodbye.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.919
Jeez, talk about Miss Jitters.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.878
- She scared of flying?
- Scared of packing.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.919
Oh, my God. You're nursing.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.116
Well, we're trying.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.237
That's so maternal instinct.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.879
That's me.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.598
l'm mama.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.513
Mama. And this is Kelly.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.557
Can you say Kelly?

10:58.880 --> 11:01.269
By the time she gets back from Paris,
you'll be such a big girl,

11:01.440 --> 11:04.750
she won't even know you.
Yes, you will.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.318
Do you wanna hold her?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.395
- ls it okay?
- Sure, she won't bite.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.278
She doesn't have any teeth.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.590
Just to be sure and hold her head up
for support.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.079
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.468
Yeah.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.110
You got it, there you go.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.999
- There you go.
- Hi, there, munchkin.

11:25.920 --> 11:29.879
- She smells like toast.
- Right out of the oven.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.316
Hello, baby.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.676
l'm your sister.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.796
Can you say Kelly?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.473
Kelly.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.271
You want half of this burrito, babe?
lt's really good.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.317
- l'm fine, thank you.
- You sure?

11:47.800 --> 11:51.952
Yeah, l'm not really into frozen lard
and hydrogenated bean oil.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.028
Did you or did you not tell me
l could get anything l wanted?

11:55.200 --> 11:57.998
l also said we desperately needed
to do a load of laundry.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.949
lf you were so desperate,
why didn't you go to the store?

12:01.120 --> 12:03.190
ln what car, Dylan?
You were gone all day.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.430
- You should've walked.
- You know, l would've walked,

12:05.600 --> 12:07.352
- but you told me you were going.
- l went.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.080
And you just forgot to get everything
that we needed.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.112
- Look, Dylan.
- Listen, Brenda.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.353
Hi, guys.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.195
- Did l come at a bad time?
- No, not at all.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.238
- Yeah, come on in.
- Thanks.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.393
l was just on my way to the store.
l gotta get some detergent. l'll be back.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.709
Are you hungry?

12:37.880 --> 12:39.108
Yeah, what've you got?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.919
Oh, there's a killer bean burrito
in the freezer in there.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.514
Cool. Later, chief.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.317
Long time no see. How you doing?

12:48.480 --> 12:50.198
Couldn't be better.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.960
She's looking me in the eye,
telling me how wonderful everything is.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.476
l can tell she's lying through her teeth,
but when l press her on it,

12:56.640 --> 12:58.870
she gets up
and starts washing the dishes.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.917
You say she and Dylan are fighting?

13:01.080 --> 13:04.755
Not while l was there,
but l could tell the vibes weren't so hot.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.639
How do you know that
without compromising your neutrality?

13:08.120 --> 13:09.917
Let me put it this way, Dad.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.718
Dylan is sleeping by himself
on the couch.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.237
Thank God for small favours.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.277
Did she ask how your father and l
were doing?

13:16.440 --> 13:18.874
No, not really.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.270
She said something about
digging in her heels,

13:21.440 --> 13:23.431
but l think if you held out
an olive branch,

13:23.600 --> 13:24.715
she might just come round.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.793
And do what, forgive us for all
the terrible things we haven't done?

13:28.960 --> 13:30.678
Come on, Brandon,
from what you're saying,

13:30.840 --> 13:32.239
to convince Brenda to come around

13:32.400 --> 13:34.994
will take a court injunction
or a miracle worker.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.439
- Hi, Mom.
- Kelly?

13:43.640 --> 13:44.868
What are you doing?

13:45.760 --> 13:49.958
Erin started crying, so l thought
l should change her diaper.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.678
Well, honey,
that was very sweet of you.

13:51.840 --> 13:52.955
l'm sorry she woke you up.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.873
No, she didn't wake me,
l wasn't sleeping.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.600
What have you been doing
for the last six hours?

13:58.760 --> 14:00.398
Watching her.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.790
But when l was rocking her
and she looked up at me,

14:05.120 --> 14:08.795
it was like l started thinking,
''This is the miracle of life.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.354
l'm holding the perfect essence
of the universe right here in my arms.''

14:13.520 --> 14:15.988
lt's getting a little philosophical
for 4:30 in the morning.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.948
No, just hear me out
because what really blows me away...

14:20.640 --> 14:23.837
Look at her.
She looks exactly like me.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.433
Yes, she does.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.754
And that's because she's my sister

14:30.160 --> 14:32.037
and you're my mom.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.750
This is my family

14:34.920 --> 14:38.674
and l'm a major part of it
for the very first time in my life.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.274
l don't wanna miss any part of that.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.996
And that's why

14:45.280 --> 14:46.872
l'm not going away
for the summer.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.469
Kelly, what are you saying?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.711
l've already been
to Europe three times.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.110
l don't need to be sent away
to find myself.

14:55.800 --> 15:00.396
What l need to do is to stay here
where l belong.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.992
You think so too, don't you?

15:11.960 --> 15:14.474
<i>l don't understand</i>
<i>why l can't have a baby</i>--

15:24.880 --> 15:26.598
Bonjour, travellers.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.993
No, no.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.118
- Donna, what's wrong?
- Her mom's making her go to Paris.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.912
Can we come in?

15:36.760 --> 15:38.193
Stop crying.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.194
l'm not blaming Kelly, l just wish
she would've blown off the trip

15:41.360 --> 15:43.351
when my mom still could have gotten
her deposit back.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.033
lt's not like l did it on purpose.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.158
l know. l think it's great that you're
bonding with this new life force,

15:48.320 --> 15:50.390
but are you telling me
this has nothing to do with Jake?

15:50.560 --> 15:54.599
No. lf anything,
l'm trying to put him out of my head.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.434
l can't spend a whole summer
in Paris myself.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.511
Donna, you'll meet people.
You'll make friends.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.352
l mean, you'll be in Paris.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.551
Well, it's easy for you to say.
You speak French.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.195
l speak nothing.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.476
Donna, it's okay.
lt's an immersion programme.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.029
You'll be <i>parlez-vous-ing</i>
before you know it.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.313
- Are you still gonna help me pack?
- l promised you l would.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.755
Yeah, you also promised you'd be
my roommate for the summer.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.319
Donna, l'm sorry.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.596
How could l have known
that l would be so connected

16:25.760 --> 16:29.753
by the sensation of finally being part
of a real family, you know?

16:29.920 --> 16:32.480
So, what are you doing
after tomorrow?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.359
Oh, yeah, right. l'll be a stowaway
in one of your suitcases.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.074
Come on. lt would be so much fun
to be with you in Paris.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.118
Yeah, but since l'm not talking
to my parents

16:40.280 --> 16:42.396
it'd be hard to hit them up
for the money to send me.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.357
Yeah and plus you'd have
to leave Dylan.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.557
- What about me? l'm leaving David.
- This is different.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.153
Brenda and Dylan
are living together.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.199
They're making a statement,
a beautiful statement.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.398
How's it going?

16:55.680 --> 16:56.999
lt couldn't be better.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.993
l'm telling you, Brandon,
she's making me crazy.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.993
- l kind of got that last night.
- You don't know the half of it.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.070
To be truthful,
l don't wanna know the half of it.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.434
l don't wanna know any of it.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.715
lt's one thing if you're putting down
my old man,

17:08.880 --> 17:10.950
but when it comes to my sister,
l don't wanna hear it.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.190
Oh, don't get me wrong, man.
l love your sister,

17:13.359 --> 17:16.715
but was she always so
into ironing everything?

17:16.880 --> 17:19.075
- Only when she gets depressed.
- Oh, that's terrific.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.356
Look at it this way,
you could always ship her home.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.717
No, l can't, man.
There's a major principle involved here.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.713
And what principle is that, Dylan?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.235
Misery loves company?

17:36.960 --> 17:38.188
Hi, Mom.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.789
Brenda.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.394
Kelly said you were at the Beach Club
yesterday asking about me.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.472
So l wanted to stop in and assure you
that l am alive and well

17:45.640 --> 17:49.269
and despite our recent fall out
with you guys

17:49.440 --> 17:52.000
that everything's great.
l'm very happy about my decision.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.000
- Which decision is that?
- To be with Dylan in the open.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.633
As a matter of fact, l'm happier
than l've been in a long time.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.552
Probably my whole life.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.234
Well, l'm glad you're happy.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.149
- l am.
- l'm glad.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.480
lt's not always easy though.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.752
Well, what's not easy?

18:14.920 --> 18:17.957
You know, life, day-to-day routine.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.875
You know,
the place looks the same.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.077
Feels different though. l guess
that's because l'm not here anymore.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.718
You're here now.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.759
l can't stay, Mom.
Not under his rules.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.154
Not until he can show me
a little respect.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.157
Respect is something you earn,
Brenda.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.956
Listen, before l forget,
l got a couple of cassettes

18:47.120 --> 18:49.111
on how to speak French
for Kelly and Donna.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.508
Oh, just Donna.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.558
Kelly decided to stay in town with
Jackie and baby Erin for the summer.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.719
Really?

18:55.880 --> 18:58.713
Yeah, can you believe it? l mean,
l'm sure the baby is cute and all,

18:58.880 --> 19:01.838
but if it were me, l would give anything
to be able to study in Paris.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.714
Well, l hope you know
what you're doing with Dylan, honey.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.755
Just lock the door when you leave.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.514
- Where are you going?
- The Beach Club.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.352
Have a nice day.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.198
- Brandon.
- Hey, man.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.999
Just in time to grab your own wheels.
The girls aren't here yet.

19:23.160 --> 19:27.676
Yeah. There's a little proposition l'd like
to float by you before they get here.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.432
Why do l feel
l'm not gonna like this?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.635
Oh, you're gonna love it.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.439
Convincing them to go along with it,
that's gonna be the tricky part.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.874
Go on.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.555
Okay, today we do everything
like we've planned.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.029
l'm with Rory. You're with Claire.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.714
We hang out, we go to the movies.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.872
But tomorrow
we pull the old switcheroo.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.591
l'll be with Claire
and you be with Rory.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.830
- How does that grab you?
- l don't know, Steve.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.468
Brandon, come on,
this is pure <i>Fantasy lsland</i> time.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.073
Two for the price of one.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.674
That way, if one of them turns out
to be a dud,

19:58.840 --> 20:01.912
neither one of us has to suffer.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.873
Wait a second.
Didn't you go out with Rory last night?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.359
Yeah.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.193
What, was it a total disaster?

20:09.360 --> 20:12.272
Oh, no, no, no.
She's a great girl, she's tons of fun.

20:13.800 --> 20:14.789
But?

20:15.280 --> 20:18.716
But we spent most of the evening
in the emergency room at Cedars.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.235
She thought
she had food poisoning.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.949
They didn't pump her stomach,
but what a way to get acquainted.

20:25.120 --> 20:29.113
Who the hell goes to a crab house
and orders squid, you know?

20:29.280 --> 20:31.475
You shouldn't be laughing.
This wouldn't be that funny

20:31.640 --> 20:34.518
- if it happened to you.
- l'm sorry. l'm sorry, l can't help it.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.796
You know, Walsh,
you got a real mean streak.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.871
You know that, don't you?

20:39.360 --> 20:40.998
l'm sorry.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.038
So how's the patient?

20:46.200 --> 20:48.760
Well, she's more embarrassed
than anything else, but she'll be fine.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.512
She just has to lie down for a while.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.150
Well, l'll lie down with her
if it'll make her feel better.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.038
l bet you would.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.872
- Listen, are you hungry?
- Starving.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.315
Order me something yummy
and l'll meet you up on the deck.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.913
Cool.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.751
You are a lucky guy, Walsh.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.151
You meet a girl and immediately
you get karma for life.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.197
l meet a beautiful damsel in distress

21:11.360 --> 21:13.237
and it turns out
l'm the one in distress.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.436
Rory's cool.
She's just having a bad run of luck.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.192
Being in the sun
was too intense for her.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.828
- Wanna trade?
- Don't be a jerk, all right?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.389
We're all gonna go out tonight.
We're gonna have a great time.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.710
- You'll see. Everything will be fine.
- Yeah.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.518
She was here?

21:27.680 --> 21:29.557
You didn't lock her in the basement?

21:29.720 --> 21:31.358
We don't have a basement, Jim.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.114
- Well, we should get one.
- Look, l felt the same way you do

21:34.280 --> 21:36.430
until it dawned on me
why she came over here.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.196
She came here
to raid our refrigerator

21:39.360 --> 21:40.918
and bring clothes
back to Dylan's house.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.355
She was looking for a way
to make peace, Jim.

21:43.520 --> 21:47.149
How can you say that?
Did she apologise?

21:47.320 --> 21:49.629
Did she express any concern
for our feelings?

21:50.160 --> 21:52.515
Did she do anything
other than insult you

21:52.680 --> 21:56.593
and announce that she will never live
in this house under our rules again?

21:56.760 --> 21:57.749
Fine.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.593
lf all you wanna do is escalate
the battle, then by all means,

22:00.760 --> 22:03.399
call your lawyer friend
and go on the attack.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.438
But if you have any interest
in regaining the love and loyalty

22:06.600 --> 22:09.319
of the only daughter
we're gonna have in this lifetime,

22:09.480 --> 22:11.152
then l strongly suggest
that you sit down

22:11.320 --> 22:13.709
and listen to what l have to say
for a change.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.478
l'm listening.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.796
Hallelujah.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.038
Was l supposed to
bring home dinner?

22:27.360 --> 22:28.793
l don't know. Were you?

22:29.360 --> 22:30.952
Who cares, right?

22:31.360 --> 22:34.193
- l care.
- Yeah, you do.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.237
Do you need me
to go to the market?

22:36.640 --> 22:38.039
Dylan, l just want you to hold me.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.875
Oh, baby.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.117
- What are we doing?
- l don't know.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.960
But whatever we're doing, Bren,
we gotta stop.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.076
l mean, we gotta stop pretending
that we're married,

22:55.240 --> 22:57.435
or we're gonna get a divorce.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.679
- l saw my mother today.
- Where?

23:00.840 --> 23:02.319
My house.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.432
And then she had to go
and l was there all by myself.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.677
So l went upstairs
and sat in my father's chair.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.118
For the first time, l started thinking

23:18.400 --> 23:20.152
that maybe my family
would've been better off

23:20.320 --> 23:22.356
if we had just stayed in Minnesota.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.432
Then l started thinking about you.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.828
And there's just one thing.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.711
Well, you're feeling much better,
aren't you?

23:50.880 --> 23:52.791
You slept it off most of the day.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.591
The swelling's down.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.952
You haven't eaten shellfish
in 24 hours.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.994
Look, l don't know, l honestly think
we may have turned a corner here.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.959
What? What's wrong?

24:09.120 --> 24:10.678
l'm having an attack of sinusitis.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.394
What's wrong?

24:19.560 --> 24:22.393
lt's from the trustees
of the estate of Dylan McKay.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.633
lt's a summons to appear
in your father's office tomorrow, 1 2:00.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.119
What for?

24:29.280 --> 24:30.679
He's going after my money.

24:30.840 --> 24:34.230
He's informed the bank that he's
considering freezing my accounts.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.992
What does that mean?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.231
That means he's playing for keeps.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.469
Brandon, what's fair is fair.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.632
And what's stupid and insulting
is stupid and insulting.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.712
Okay, now we all know
who got the stupid one.

25:02.880 --> 25:05.678
Steve, if you wanna go out with Claire,
just call her up and ask her.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.990
l don't care. l'm not gonna make
a stink about some girl

25:08.160 --> 25:09.912
who's going back
to Florida in a couple days.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.513
But don't make me go out with Rory

25:11.680 --> 25:14.319
just because you got
some fantasy thing about twins.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.471
What if Rory
wants to go out with you?

25:16.640 --> 25:19.438
l guarantee you something.
lf you call Rory

25:19.600 --> 25:21.511
and tell her you wanna pull
a little switcheroo,

25:21.680 --> 25:23.238
her and her sister
will be so insulted,

25:23.400 --> 25:24.992
neither of them will talk to us again.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.192
You wanna bet?

25:27.640 --> 25:31.713
Six-thirty going once.
Six-thirty going twice.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.473
Sold to the cute girl
from Fort Lauderdale.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.949
- Steve, get off the phone.
- All right. So l'll see you then.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.476
And please tell Rory
l'm glad she's feeling better.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.870
Yeah, you never know.
She and Brandon just may hit it off.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.993
- Steve.
- l'll see you around 6:30.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.593
Bye, babe.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.198
Refresh my memory. Did we have
a little wager on this deal here?

25:51.360 --> 25:53.237
Tell me,
how'd you know they'd go for it?

25:53.400 --> 25:54.879
Even when you were with Claire,

25:55.040 --> 25:57.474
l sensed there was some chemistry
going on between us.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.632
l would've said something,
but l didn't wanna get into

26:00.800 --> 26:02.552
a competitive thing with you
over some girl.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.678
Oh, no. Not you, Steve.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.917
Six-thirty.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.597
Mind if l join you?

26:13.520 --> 26:15.033
Go ahead.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.995
Donna, when you going to Europe?

26:21.280 --> 26:23.510
- Day after tomorrow.
- Well, are you all packed?

26:23.680 --> 26:25.272
- Oh, my God.
- What did l say?

26:25.440 --> 26:27.670
You have to come with me, David.
That's all there is to it.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.592
l'd get on that plane
in a minute if l could,

26:29.760 --> 26:31.512
but if there's any hope of me
graduating early

26:31.680 --> 26:32.874
l've gotta go to summer school

26:33.040 --> 26:35.190
and get my math and science
requirements out of the way.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.078
l really feel for you, Donna.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.878
l can't believe Kelly's
gonna shy on Europe

26:39.040 --> 26:40.951
just so she can stay home
and moon over some baby.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.918
- She's really flipped out.
- No, she hasn't.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.638
l mean, Paris is Paris,

26:45.800 --> 26:48.758
but you have to admit,
it's an awfully cute baby.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.157
Yeah, my mom's breast-feeding.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.198
lt's hard to do all the feedings
without getting sleep deprivation,

26:55.360 --> 26:57.316
so l give her her bottle
at the 4:00 shift.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.153
- Four o'clock in the morning?
- <i>Yeah, but it's worth it,</i>

27:00.320 --> 27:02.595
l get to spend a lot of private time
with the baby.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.274
Bren, you have to meet her.
She is so alert.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.514
<i>So precious,</i>
<i>l could just eat her up,</i>

27:08.680 --> 27:10.989
Yeah, well, l can't wait.
Look, l've gotta get off.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.037
- <i>Well, call me later,</i>
- l will.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.714
Well, here goes nothing.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.030
No, here goes a lot.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.270
Look, the fact that you're going
to my father's office

27:21.440 --> 27:23.829
to stand up for what's right
means more than you'll ever know.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.197
Brenda, your father is my trustee.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.113
He sent me a summons.
lt's not like l have a choice.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.316
But if you did have a choice,

27:32.760 --> 27:34.796
l know you'd be there for me.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.478
lt's come to the attention of the trust

27:42.640 --> 27:45.518
that you are currently
cohabitating with a minor.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.996
And you are aware
that she is under 1 8.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.119
All right.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.430
As the officer sworn
to protect and maintain

27:54.600 --> 27:56.318
the integrity of your estate,

27:56.480 --> 28:00.075
it is my obligation not to accept
any conduct on your part

28:00.240 --> 28:02.151
which puts the estate at risk.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.833
And, by harbouring a minor,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.992
you are technically
committing statutory rape.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.189
l knew it.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.352
Therefore, according
to the terms of the trust,

28:13.520 --> 28:14.953
l am left with no choice

28:15.120 --> 28:18.317
but to impound any and all assets
of the trust

28:18.480 --> 28:21.438
until you cease and desist
in engaging in any activity

28:21.600 --> 28:24.353
which is not in the best interest
of the trust.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.748
Oh, come on, man.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.388
You got a lot of other options
instead of going after me,

28:28.560 --> 28:30.471
you just choose not
to acknowledge them.

28:31.640 --> 28:35.110
lt is not my fault that you can't
communicate with your daughter.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.955
You're right, it's not your fault.
lt's your problem.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.033
What was l supposed to do?

28:43.200 --> 28:46.397
She showed up on my doorstep.
l didn't want her to move in.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.757
l knew it was a mistake.
l knew it'd make you crazy.

28:50.720 --> 28:54.110
And the fact is,
my place just isn't all that big.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.989
Things are getting
a little bit cramped over there, huh?

28:58.160 --> 29:00.355
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.958
All right. Here's the deal.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.432
Brenda is gonna be offered the chance
to study in Paris this summer.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.718
lf you don't stand in her way,
but instead help Cindy and me

29:11.880 --> 29:15.509
to convince her
that it's in her best interest to go,

29:15.720 --> 29:17.597
well, everyone's problem
might just go away.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.992
That's blackmail.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.275
We choose to think of it as

29:24.840 --> 29:26.478
creative parenting.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.199
Steve.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.669
Brandon, get dressed.
The girls will be here any minute.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.195
That's what l wanted to talk
to you about.

29:37.520 --> 29:41.354
As a self-respecting twin, l can't
go through with this switcheroo thing.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.793
Well, it's a little late for that now,
Brandon.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.638
Look, why don't you go out with Claire
and have a good time.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.952
l'll break it with Rory.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.832
Whatever. l just never figured you
for a PG-1 3 kind of guy.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.831
Rory, Brandon's over there.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.351
- Hi, Rory.
- Hi, Brandon.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.149
Listen, this is gonna sound absurd
but--

30:21.880 --> 30:23.518
You're not Rory.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.394
Someone's gotta teach him a lesson.

30:33.480 --> 30:34.799
Well, we can go to dinner now

30:34.960 --> 30:37.428
or we could go upstairs
to my mom's cabana

30:37.600 --> 30:38.874
and watch the sunset.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.951
lt's a killer view.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.111
What do you say, Claire?

30:43.760 --> 30:46.035
Let's go for it, big boy.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.313
Hey.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.195
Why didn't you call?
l've been climbing the walls.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.230
After the meeting,
l just got in the car and drove.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.112
lt was that bad, huh?

31:02.360 --> 31:07.115
Actually, no. l just needed some time
to sort a few things out.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.353
- You know your red dress?
- Yeah.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.748
Put it on.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.673
- We're going out?
- Dinner at your parents' house.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.796
We have to be there
in about half an hour.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.235
No way. Not with the way
my father's been treating us.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.436
- Brenda.
- Dylan, no.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.511
The way he's been hassling you
about your estate,

31:24.680 --> 31:26.671
l don't wanna go over there ever again.
That's that.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.354
No, Bren, that is not that.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.069
Wait till you taste my patented
mucho marvellous mango margaritas.

31:40.240 --> 31:43.676
Hey, if you're gonna be drinking,
l don't wanna be driving with you.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.234
Well, in that case,
we'll just have to stay here all night.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.114
Oh, that ought to be interesting.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.869
l've wanted to do that
since l first saw you.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.392
Hey, didn't you say the same thing
to Rory

32:00.560 --> 32:02.152
the night you took her
to the crab house?

32:02.400 --> 32:04.755
No, no.
Rory and l had nothing going on.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.751
She's a good sport.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.438
She's boring.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.834
You think so?

32:12.600 --> 32:13.919
Yeah.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.195
She's not nearly as hot
or sexy as you are.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.312
Let's do it.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.997
Let's go for it. Come on, Claire.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.151
l'm not Claire, you dumb guy.
l'm Rory.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.319
What?

32:41.520 --> 32:46.071
You are such a slimy seal.
You couldn't even tell the difference.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.556
Good timing.
Just took the fish off the grill.

32:53.720 --> 32:54.869
l'm not hungry.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.235
Well, why don't you come in anyway.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.950
As long as you both understand
the only reason l'm here

33:00.120 --> 33:01.917
is because Dylan asked me.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.433
lt's nice to see you too, sweetie.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.433
Brenda, can l speak to you
for a minute, please?

33:07.960 --> 33:09.632
Look, l know you're angry,

33:09.800 --> 33:13.190
but could you please try not to say
something you're gonna regret later?

33:13.360 --> 33:15.510
Fine. l won't say anything at all.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.075
- Sauce is delicious, dear.
- Thank you.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.275
lt's a pink bearnaise.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.398
lt's made with tomatoes
and peppers and zucchini.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.551
Sounds very original.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.713
Well, it's from my authentic
April in Paris cookbook.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.951
Ought to give it to Donna.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.958
Or to you.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.713
What?

33:49.000 --> 33:50.399
Do you have the envelope?

33:59.840 --> 34:01.432
This is a roundtrip ticket to Paris.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.595
Look, has your name on it.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.194
And l understand there's a lycee
on the Rue des Jardins

34:07.360 --> 34:11.353
that is holding a place for you
under the name of Kelly Taylor.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.158
You're actually sending me to Paris?

34:13.320 --> 34:14.878
Well, it gives us
some breathing space

34:15.040 --> 34:17.235
and a way to start all over again
when you get back.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.995
And a clever way
to keep me from Dylan.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.118
- Brenda.
- That's what this is all about, isn't it?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.118
A bribe.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.875
A way to buy my love.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.351
This is so Beverly Hills. l can't believe
l'm sitting in the same room with you.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.158
Bren.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.318
Have any other suggestions?

34:47.199 --> 34:48.871
Brenda, you gotta calm down.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.190
l'll be fine as soon as
l get out of this house.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.079
No, listen to me.
You're not thinking clearly here.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.389
lf l'm not, Dylan,
it's because of them.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.472
Look, they are manipulative.
They are arrogant. They are mean.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.073
Well, yeah, they're your parents.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.630
But, Bren, they're not perfect, okay?
So who is?

35:04.800 --> 35:07.712
- Listen to you.
- l'm being realistic here, okay?

35:07.880 --> 35:10.235
So, what if your father's motives
are bogus and heavy-handed?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.231
So, what if he's trying
to set our agenda for us?

35:12.400 --> 35:16.234
We are talking about a chance
to see Paris, okay?

35:16.400 --> 35:19.233
l've been there, you haven't, and
l think that you're making a mistake

35:19.400 --> 35:21.960
if you let this opportunity
to see that part of the world slip by

35:22.120 --> 35:23.838
just because your father
pushes you too hard

35:24.000 --> 35:26.560
and doesn't know when to let go.
Do you know what l'm saying?

35:28.960 --> 35:32.714
Look, Brenda, it's obvious
that you are as frustrated and angry

35:32.880 --> 35:34.552
with us as we are with you.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.720
But you should know
that sending you to Paris

35:37.880 --> 35:40.553
was my brilliant idea,
not your father's.

35:40.720 --> 35:44.713
ln fact, he predicted you'd see it
as a ploy to keep you and Dylan apart.

35:44.920 --> 35:48.117
Are you telling me that the thought
never even entered into your mind?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.318
Look, maybe it did,

35:50.480 --> 35:53.313
but l just don't wanna see you
make the same mistake l did.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.994
Oh, come on, Mom.
You and dad lived together

35:56.160 --> 35:58.390
before you got married.
You guys managed to survive.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.711
That's not what l'm talking about.
l'm talking about--

36:03.640 --> 36:04.959
Look.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.470
When l was in college,

36:08.640 --> 36:11.473
l was gonna spend my junior year
at the Sorbonne in Paris

36:12.240 --> 36:14.470
and then l met your father

36:15.120 --> 36:17.270
and l decided to stay in Minnesota.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.829
Well, everybody thought
l was a complete fool,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.070
but l insisted that l knew
exactly what l was doing.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.470
l'd have plenty of time to travel
after l graduated.

36:25.960 --> 36:30.511
And of course, 20 years later,
l've never been to Paris

36:30.680 --> 36:32.796
or London or anywhere, really.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.154
Except Beverly Hills.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.118
So are you saying l could still
go to Paris if l wanted to?

36:39.520 --> 36:41.351
Well,

36:41.600 --> 36:43.636
it's probably easier
to send you to Paris

36:43.800 --> 36:46.189
than to keep you locked up
in the basement for the summer.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.351
Especially considering
we don't have a basement.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.034
Look, honey, whether you go or not,

36:51.200 --> 36:53.839
we're gonna get through this.
We really will.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.948
So you just let us know
what you wanna do.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.031
Why are things
always so complicated?

37:10.800 --> 37:13.837
l don't know,
seems pretty simple to me, really.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.309
You just get on a plane
and have the time of your life.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.472
- What about us?
- Us?

37:19.680 --> 37:25.152
Well, if our relationship can't stand
six weeks without seeing each other,

37:25.320 --> 37:28.596
maybe your father's right.
We don't belong together.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.393
Dylan.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.913
Jim.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.672
l understand my daughter's
gonna be on a plane tomorrow.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.958
Got what you wanted.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.838
Well, l wouldn't go that far.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.275
With Brenda, one learns to distinguish
between what you want

37:49.440 --> 37:50.634
and what you get.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.791
You can say that again.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.955
ln any event,
l think having her go to Paris

37:56.120 --> 37:57.997
might just be the best thing
for all of us.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.754
lt's the best thing for Brenda
and that's why l went along with it

38:00.920 --> 38:03.832
and didn't tell her about the little chat
in your office today.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.631
l appreciate that.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.479
ln the future, l would appreciate it,

38:12.640 --> 38:14.392
regardless of what happens
with me and Brenda

38:14.560 --> 38:16.073
or you and Brenda,

38:16.240 --> 38:17.434
if you want something from me,

38:17.600 --> 38:19.352
you don't have to put
a loaded gun on my head.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.112
Just ask me.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.395
Okay.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.312
See you around.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.712
Take care of yourself, son.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.238
So Brenda lies to my parents,
throws temper tantrums,

38:33.400 --> 38:34.958
runs away to Dylan's house.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.633
What does she get
for her punishment?

38:36.800 --> 38:38.791
She gets to go spend the summer
in Paris.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.190
- What's wrong with this picture?
- lt's a strange world.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.839
And it's getting stranger every day.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.309
Yeah. Maybe l should just get drunk
and crash my car again.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.993
Or better yet, get a couple of hookers

38:47.160 --> 38:49.799
and have a little orgy in front
of Jim and Cindy.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.792
Just make sure they're not twins.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.916
Rory laid it on pretty thick, huh?

38:54.080 --> 38:55.798
Yeah. l'd say it ranked

38:55.960 --> 38:59.077
as one of the top 1 0
most humiliating moments in my life.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.912
And l wonder why l'm lonely.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.469
Well, hey, buddy, l guarantee you
by the end of this summer,

39:04.640 --> 39:07.359
we're gonna find you a woman
if it's the last thing we do.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.792
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hey, Andrea.

39:10.960 --> 39:14.157
Listen, my parents are having
a little bon voyage party for Brenda

39:14.320 --> 39:15.992
because she's going to Paris
for the summer--

39:16.160 --> 39:18.116
Lucky girl.
Say goodbye to her for me, okay?

39:18.280 --> 39:21.716
- Jay. l'm sorry, l gotta go, bye.
- Okay.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.119
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.875
Hard to believe Andrea's
still going out with Jay Thurman.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.630
He's the former editor
of the B <i>laze</i>, you know.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.439
l know who he is, Steve, thanks.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.390
You know what we're gonna do
after we find you a girl?

39:40.560 --> 39:41.754
What?

39:41.960 --> 39:44.235
We gotta find me one too.

39:45.960 --> 39:49.839
Obviously, these past few weeks
have been very rocky.

39:51.360 --> 39:54.796
Frankly, life's too short
to be fighting with you all the time.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.672
l know.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.715
Gonna be a senior next year.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.673
Gonna be going to college.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.990
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

40:06.280 --> 40:10.910
lt's no fun going through life without
the love and support of your parents.

40:11.080 --> 40:14.231
Believe me,
l know what that feels like.

40:14.440 --> 40:15.839
So when you're in Paris
this summer,

40:16.000 --> 40:17.752
l would hope that you'll think
long and hard

40:17.920 --> 40:22.436
about the kind of relationship
you wanna have with me

40:22.760 --> 40:24.955
and your mother and your brother

40:26.160 --> 40:28.833
and if l don't stop talking,
you're gonna miss the plane.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.592
Thanks, Daddy.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.834
Not just for sending me,
but for giving me another chance.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.433
l'll write you every day
and l'll call you every Sunday morning.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.637
Or maybe Sunday night.
Depends on if the rates change.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.679
- Call me anytime, l'll be here.
- Okay.

40:55.840 --> 40:57.796
- Have a safe trip.
- Okay. Bye.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.593
You do lead a charmed life,
you know that.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.468
Take care of them for me, will you?

41:04.800 --> 41:06.836
You take care of yourself.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.631
Bye, Brandon.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.678
Have fun, okay?

41:17.280 --> 41:19.840
l can't believe
this is really happening.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.069
Me neither.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.959
Now l've gotta start
doing my own laundry again.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.111
l'll miss you too, Dylan.

41:27.040 --> 41:32.160
Go on. Just don't fall in love
over there, okay?

41:32.760 --> 41:34.671
That goes for you too.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.039
Oh, God.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.838
Are you sad?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.912
Petrified. l hate flying.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.676
Just think, Kel, you could've been
on that van.

42:01.840 --> 42:02.875
Yep.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.632
l bet Jake's glad
you're staying in town.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.394
l don't know.
We might get together sometime.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.118
Oh, Kelly.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.669
Hey, l might even get together
with you.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.673
Really? l might just hold you to that.
