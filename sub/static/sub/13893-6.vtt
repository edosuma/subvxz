WEBVTT

00:12.838 --> 00:13.688
Dude, hurry up!

00:13.688 --> 00:15.338
Tie it down, we're gonna be late!

00:16.038 --> 00:18.068
Go, Go, Go! Take that street!

00:18.218 --> 00:20.198
We're not gonna make it, we're not gonna make it!

00:20.458 --> 00:23.158
I knew it. I knew they'd be late.

00:23.158 --> 00:24.908
This is gonna be close.

00:27.368 --> 00:28.368
That's it.

00:31.438 --> 00:33.858
Dude, we made it! Dude, we made it!

00:42.088 --> 00:43.808
Here's the lemon tree you asked us to pick up.

00:43.808 --> 00:44.938
Right on time.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.188
I think the guy sold us a lemon, know what I'm sayin'?

00:52.078 --> 00:54.778
No. You know what? I blame myself.

00:54.878 --> 00:57.168
I should've known better than to trust you two morons

00:57.168 --> 00:58.988
with such a straightforward task.

00:58.988 --> 01:00.988
You obviously need supervision.

01:00.988 --> 01:02.218
Super-what-now?

01:02.268 --> 01:04.888
Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, get down here!

01:04.888 --> 01:06.888
I need you to watch over Mordecai and Rigby.

01:06.888 --> 01:08.258
We'll be right there.

01:08.538 --> 01:09.568
- What?! - No way!

01:09.568 --> 01:11.568
You can't stick us with Muscle Man and Hi Five!

01:11.568 --> 01:12.738
Those guys are turds!

01:12.738 --> 01:14.998
They have the combined intelligence of bread-mold!

01:15.098 --> 01:17.258
Come on, Benson. Give us one more chance.

01:17.258 --> 01:18.448
No more chances!

01:18.508 --> 01:21.798
I'm sending you to the nursery to pick up another lemon tree.

01:21.798 --> 01:23.078
If you screw up again,

01:23.078 --> 01:26.108
I'll have Muscle Man and Hi Five supervise the next job.

01:26.108 --> 01:29.248
Then the next job, and the next. Get it?!

01:29.248 --> 01:30.498
Yes. Um, yes, sir.

01:30.498 --> 01:31.408
I'm sure.

01:33.228 --> 01:34.368
Aw, man!

01:34.368 --> 01:36.218
Ugh, this blows!

01:36.268 --> 01:38.408
- You know what the worst is? - The smell?

01:38.448 --> 01:42.228
No, dude. Those lame "my mom" jokes Muscle Man always tells.

01:45.878 --> 01:46.968
Great.

01:48.748 --> 01:50.158
Well, well, well!

01:50.188 --> 01:53.468
Sounds like someone needs some supervision!

01:53.468 --> 01:56.138
You know who else needs supervision?

01:56.298 --> 01:57.748
MY MOM!

02:00.648 --> 02:03.308
Now get in the back so I can supervise you.

02:05.808 --> 02:07.638
This song rocks.

02:07.658 --> 02:10.118
You know who else rocks this hard?

02:10.148 --> 02:11.768
MY MOM!

02:11.768 --> 02:13.748
I don't know how long I can take this.

02:13.748 --> 02:15.798
I know dude but if we don't pull this off...

02:15.798 --> 02:17.028
Aw, sick.

02:17.028 --> 02:19.218
I love this tasty lick!

02:19.218 --> 02:20.658
That's it! I'm jumping!

02:20.658 --> 02:22.268
No dude. Don't worry.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.448
There's the nursery.

02:23.448 --> 02:24.958
This will all be over soon.

02:25.948 --> 02:28.238
Dude! You just passed the nursery!

02:28.238 --> 02:31.048
Pull your panties out of your butt, bro! I know a shortcut!

02:31.048 --> 02:32.428
But it was right there!

02:32.428 --> 02:35.358
Who's supervising this mission!? ME, that's who!

02:35.358 --> 02:38.608
So, shut your word-hole, I'm listening to my jams!

02:43.978 --> 02:45.898
What!? Where are we?

02:45.968 --> 02:47.218
Why are we stopping?

02:47.218 --> 02:48.538
It's lunchtime!

02:48.578 --> 02:51.348
This place has the best tacos in the city!

02:52.258 --> 02:55.338
You know who else has the best tacos in the city?

02:55.338 --> 02:58.098
Dude, Benson will blow a fuse if he finds out we were slacking off!

02:58.098 --> 02:59.868
You know who else would blow a fuse

02:59.868 --> 03:01.668
if she found out we were slacking off?

03:01.668 --> 03:02.788
We don't have time for this!

03:02.788 --> 03:05.108
You know who else doesn't have time for this?

03:05.328 --> 03:07.288
You know who else says "Ugh"?

03:07.358 --> 03:08.928
MY MOM!

03:09.998 --> 03:13.208
Can we please get lunch after we pick up the tree?

03:13.488 --> 03:14.688
No can do.

03:14.738 --> 03:17.658
Hi Fives has gots to have his tacos!

03:17.658 --> 03:18.918
Watch this!

03:19.808 --> 03:24.048
Hey, Benson, we're gonna pull over and grab some lunch, that cool?

03:24.048 --> 03:26.348
Go for it. I know you guys will get it done.

03:27.918 --> 03:29.768
Benson is never that cool with us!

03:29.768 --> 03:32.008
What? Don't you guys check in?

03:32.258 --> 03:33.628
Uh, no.

03:33.738 --> 03:35.338
You gotta check in!

03:35.368 --> 03:36.828
Benson's the boss.

03:36.828 --> 03:39.678
He needs to know where you are at all times!

03:40.548 --> 03:42.048
LET'S EAT!

03:42.218 --> 03:44.068
How come you never check in!?

03:44.068 --> 03:48.488
Muslce Man! Hi Five Ghost! I haven't seen you guys in ages.

03:48.488 --> 03:50.158
Who are those losers?

03:51.508 --> 03:53.618
Just some chumps I'm supervising.

03:53.678 --> 03:55.618
I gotta make sure their doing it right.

03:55.618 --> 03:57.728
I feel sorry for you guys.

03:57.728 --> 04:00.208
You know who I feel sorry for?

04:00.208 --> 04:01.648
MY MOM!

04:10.298 --> 04:13.178
Here's your round 'o tacos, for makin' me laugh!

04:14.148 --> 04:16.958
Aw, what? You actually thought that was funny?

04:16.958 --> 04:19.608
I guess Muscle Man is really insulting himself.

04:21.908 --> 04:24.798
It's getting late. Shouldn't we be at the nursery by now?

04:25.398 --> 04:27.618
Relax, Hi Fives on it.

04:27.618 --> 04:31.508
He knows how to hot-wire the cart, to make it go crazy-fast.

04:31.598 --> 04:34.248
You know who taught Hi Fives to hot-wire the cart

04:34.248 --> 04:36.248
to get away with slacking off at work

04:36.248 --> 04:38.608
and not get in trouble with his boss?

04:40.278 --> 04:42.688
My uncle, John. He's a mechanic.

04:43.048 --> 04:44.398
That's cool.

04:44.438 --> 04:46.268
You know who taught him!?

04:46.408 --> 04:49.148
MY MOM! YES!

04:51.138 --> 04:52.958
Let's ride, babies!

05:00.718 --> 05:02.038
The road's back there!

05:02.038 --> 05:04.408
Don't tell me where the road is, baby!

05:17.288 --> 05:18.658
Yo, Muscle Man!

05:18.688 --> 05:22.068
You know how to break the law in all the right ways!

05:25.528 --> 05:26.708
What was that?

05:26.708 --> 05:28.198
This is awesome!

05:30.548 --> 05:31.548
We're here.

05:32.938 --> 05:34.118
What are you doing?

05:34.148 --> 05:35.968
You're trying to throw you backs out?

05:36.008 --> 05:37.648
You don't lift it like that.

05:37.658 --> 05:39.068
That's what Bobby's for.

05:39.118 --> 05:40.428
Hey, yo, Bobby!

05:41.538 --> 05:43.578
Bobby here lifts like a champ.

05:45.568 --> 05:48.918
Hey Bobby, you know who else lifts like a champ?

05:48.918 --> 05:50.418
MY MOM!

05:54.768 --> 05:55.618
What?

05:55.618 --> 05:58.738
Dude, I think Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are actually kinda cool!

05:58.738 --> 06:01.448
Lift with the legs, Bobby! The legs!

06:01.468 --> 06:03.168
Like my mom!

06:04.638 --> 06:06.268
'Yo killin' me, man!

06:07.398 --> 06:09.838
Yeah, I don't know about that

06:13.068 --> 06:15.438
Well, I'm glad this is finally over.

06:15.438 --> 06:17.028
- Come on, it wasn't-- - Dude!

06:17.608 --> 06:19.108
You just passed the park!

06:19.108 --> 06:20.958
What's the hurry, grandma?

06:20.958 --> 06:23.728
We have all day, let's have some fun!

06:24.698 --> 06:26.618
Come on, dude, just give him a chance!

07:00.428 --> 07:02.128
Dude, Muscle Man's pretty cool.

07:02.158 --> 07:04.128
All except for those "my mom" jokes.

07:04.128 --> 07:05.538
Dude, I'm gonna to say something.

07:05.538 --> 07:08.498
No, don't! Don't try to change Muscle Man, it's not cool!

07:08.498 --> 07:09.468
Hey, guys!

07:09.528 --> 07:12.458
I haven't had quality bro time like this in ages.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.268
We should do this all the time.

07:14.298 --> 07:17.148
I know I mess around a lot, but you guys are the best.

07:18.308 --> 07:19.748
Hey, Mordecai,

07:19.758 --> 07:22.688
you know who else messes around a lot?

07:23.998 --> 07:27.628
MY MOM!

07:29.088 --> 07:31.378
Dude, you're saying it wrong.

07:31.378 --> 07:32.448
Mordecai!

07:32.448 --> 07:34.128
What was that, bro?

07:34.128 --> 07:36.868
Dude, that joke doesn't make any sense.

07:36.868 --> 07:39.968
Whenever you say stuff like that, you're making fun of your own mom.

07:39.968 --> 07:42.788
It should be "your mom", not "my mom".

07:42.788 --> 07:43.928
What do you mean?

07:43.928 --> 07:45.728
Well, for example,

07:45.728 --> 07:47.958
you know who else has a gap in their teeth?

07:47.958 --> 07:49.118
YOUR MOM!

07:49.268 --> 07:50.198
Or,

07:50.208 --> 07:52.288
you know who else is prematurely balding?

07:52.288 --> 07:53.658
YOUR MOM!

07:53.668 --> 07:54.838
Rigby, help me out.

07:56.138 --> 07:58.138
You know who else finds their clothes it the garbage?

07:58.148 --> 07:59.458
YOUR MOM!

07:59.498 --> 08:00.998
You know who else lives in their car?

08:01.008 --> 08:02.108
YOUR MOM!

08:02.108 --> 08:03.678
You know who else has fat ankles?

08:03.678 --> 08:04.838
YOUR MOM!

08:04.848 --> 08:06.148
You know who else can't tell a--

08:09.148 --> 08:11.638
Are you making fun of my mom?!

08:11.638 --> 08:13.638
You're making fun of my mom!

08:13.638 --> 08:16.068
No one makes fun of my mom!

08:16.068 --> 08:18.448
Yo, little brother! My ears are ringing!

08:18.448 --> 08:20.378
Is someone making fun of our mom?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.958
Yeah, they are, bro!

08:21.958 --> 08:24.298
- Oh no, bro! - I know, bro!

08:24.298 --> 08:25.908
That's it! I'm coming up there!

08:26.438 --> 08:29.528
You ladies are about to wish you were never born!

08:29.528 --> 08:30.958
GET OUT OF THE CART!

08:31.788 --> 08:33.038
You're gonna get it!

08:33.048 --> 08:34.998
Nobody makes fun of my mom!

08:35.008 --> 08:36.038
Nobody!

08:56.838 --> 09:00.588
Which one of you girls was talking about my mom?!

09:00.588 --> 09:02.198
Was it you, Tiny?

09:02.458 --> 09:04.508
Or you, stringbean?

09:05.118 --> 09:07.388
- We were just-- - So it was both of you!

09:07.488 --> 09:10.448
I think they hurt mom's feelings, bro!

09:10.548 --> 09:13.518
You hurt our mom's feelings!

09:13.518 --> 09:17.408
Pay her a compliment, tell her she's beautiful!

09:17.418 --> 09:18.218
TELL HER!

09:18.928 --> 09:21.578
You're beautiful, Muscle Man's mom.

09:21.578 --> 09:24.498
Now, kiss the photo and tell her you're sorry!

09:24.498 --> 09:25.288
Sorry.

09:27.498 --> 09:28.318
Sorry!

09:28.348 --> 09:30.368
Fire up the grill, bro.

09:38.438 --> 09:41.778
Eat this picture of our mom, or you'll be sorry!

09:41.848 --> 09:44.198
Please, don't make us eat the picture!

09:44.198 --> 09:45.058
EAT IT!

09:58.578 --> 10:01.208
You should have seen the look on your faces!

10:01.208 --> 10:03.298
We got you good!

10:03.308 --> 10:04.118
What?

10:04.118 --> 10:07.758
It was all a prank and you chumps fell for it!

10:12.688 --> 10:15.898
That's not even a picture of my mom!

10:16.028 --> 10:18.418
It's a picture of my buttcheek!

10:18.418 --> 10:21.618
I just squished it up to look like a woman's face!

10:21.618 --> 10:23.188
Aw, sick!

10:23.188 --> 10:24.688
Are you still hungry?

10:24.688 --> 10:27.018
Cause I got multiple prints!

10:27.148 --> 10:30.148
That's right! I dabble in photography!

10:32.948 --> 10:36.158
Thanks for picking up this tree. I knew I could trust you two.

10:36.238 --> 10:37.458
As for you two,

10:37.458 --> 10:39.408
the next time I tell you to do something,

10:39.408 --> 10:42.158
do it right, or I'll have you supervise you again.

10:42.158 --> 10:43.008
Got it?

10:44.138 --> 10:45.958
You know who else is going to have to

10:45.958 --> 10:49.318
get supervised again for not doing it right?

10:49.508 --> 10:51.208
MY MOM!

10:52.528 --> 10:54.478
Yeah, ladies!

10:55.578 --> 10:57.308
I really hate Muscle Man.

10:57.418 --> 10:59.508
You know who else really hates Muscle Man?
