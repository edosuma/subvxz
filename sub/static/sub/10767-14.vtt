00:28.973 --> 00:32.807
Why don't you put that down
and come sit next to me.

00:47.813 --> 00:50.247
- How's that? Everything cool?
- Great.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.970
- It worked?
- Perfect, Branford, you hear?

00:53.133 --> 00:57.172
Good, I'm glad you liked it.
So, Will, I'm off like a dirty shirt.

00:57.373 --> 01:01.048
Hey, peace with two fingers, man.
Give J some for me, all right?

01:03.693 --> 01:06.765
There's definitely some perks
to working for NBC.

02:20.533 --> 02:23.730
- I call the couch in the living room.
- No, I'm sleeping on the couch.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.453
You can sleep under the couch,
you squidgit.

02:27.453 --> 02:29.250
- I'm sleeping on the couch.
- I said no.

02:29.413 --> 02:31.051
Oh, grow up, you two.

02:31.253 --> 02:32.925
I can't believe you're staying here.

02:33.093 --> 02:36.802
Imagine calling an exterminator
for a few harmless little crickets.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.770
Supposed to be soothing,
for God's sake.

02:39.413 --> 02:41.847
No, Uncle Phil.
I don't think you understand, man.

02:42.013 --> 02:46.131
Now, these ain't them cute little
Jiminy-wish-upon-a-star-type crickets.

02:46.293 --> 02:49.842
No, man. These are big, mean,
nasty, bug-eyed...

02:50.013 --> 02:52.652
...take-over-the-human-race
kind of crickets, man.

02:53.533 --> 02:56.047
You can borrow my makeup,
but the key is subtlety.

02:56.213 --> 03:00.047
<i>You want your date to think you
stepped out of Vogue not a clown car.</i>

03:00.213 --> 03:01.851
- Date?
- Tonight's the night.

03:02.013 --> 03:03.810
I go to the movies with Randy,
remember?

03:04.293 --> 03:05.646
Randy? Randy who?

03:05.973 --> 03:07.611
Why wasn't I consulted about this?

03:07.773 --> 03:10.128
Stop pretending you don't know
anything about it.

03:10.293 --> 03:11.567
You already gave permission.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.769
You cannot keep little girls
from growing up.

03:13.933 --> 03:16.401
I can and I will.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.171
Ashley, come here.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.291
Look, now, seeing as how
this is your first real date...

03:21.453 --> 03:23.887
...I think there's a couple things
you need to know.

03:24.053 --> 03:28.604
Listen, if you're gonna hold the popcorn,
make sure you hold it up in plain sight...

03:28.773 --> 03:30.684
...so when he go reaching
for the bucket...

03:30.853 --> 03:32.969
...he don't miss,
talking about, "Oops."

03:33.173 --> 03:35.892
And stop at a gas station
and make sure that tank is full.

03:36.053 --> 03:39.284
And if he tells you
to pull his finger, don't do it.

03:40.973 --> 03:43.009
Oh, man.

03:43.213 --> 03:46.011
Thanks, but it's just
a little innocent date.

03:46.213 --> 03:47.328
Nothing's gonna happen.

03:47.493 --> 03:49.404
Oh, you're right,
nothing's gonna happen...

03:49.573 --> 03:51.882
...because I want you
back here at 9:30.

03:52.053 --> 03:54.044
But the movie
doesn't even end until 10.

03:54.373 --> 03:57.285
Well, you can catch the end of it
when it comes out on video.

03:57.453 --> 04:00.365
- Daddy!
- Ashley, be back by 10:30.

04:00.693 --> 04:02.843
Ten-thirty on the dot.

04:03.053 --> 04:06.409
Not 10:31, and that's in this house.

04:06.733 --> 04:09.008
Not on the porch,
not parked out on the driveway.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.561
Now, if you'll excuse me...

04:10.733 --> 04:13.725
...I'm gonna go check the video camera
over the front door.

04:15.173 --> 04:17.243
Daddy never gave Hilary a curfew.

04:17.613 --> 04:20.446
He was probably hoping
she wouldn't come back.

04:20.613 --> 04:23.047
Oh, that reminds me,
I'm gonna be out late tonight.

04:23.373 --> 04:26.445
I'm shooting a commercial
for Casual Cup coffee.

04:26.653 --> 04:28.530
That's great. How'd you get it?

04:28.733 --> 04:31.247
Well, the director said
I reminded him of the coffee.

04:31.413 --> 04:35.292
Oh, yeah, he probably thought
you was hot, creamy and rich.

04:35.453 --> 04:38.172
Oh, yeah, that's it.

04:38.373 --> 04:41.171
I was pretty sure
I wasn't mountain-grown.

04:41.813 --> 04:43.166
Check please.

04:44.013 --> 04:46.288
I guess that leaves the house
to just you and me.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.921
I can write my paper
while you study for your midterm.

04:49.093 --> 04:52.290
It'll be nice and quiet. We can
clear tables like the study center.

04:52.653 --> 04:56.089
You know what? I know how we can
make it even more like the study center.

04:56.253 --> 04:57.766
I won't be here.

04:57.933 --> 05:00.288
I'll go run some ball.
I'll get with you all later.

05:00.453 --> 05:02.330
But you told me
you haven't studied yet.

05:02.493 --> 05:03.642
I haven't.

05:03.813 --> 05:05.451
Look, Carlton, I'm the king of cram.

05:05.613 --> 05:07.649
All I need is three solid hours
and I'm cool.

05:07.813 --> 05:11.203
Will, let me tell you a little story
about the grasshopper and the ant.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.323
I really don't feel like hearing
about you and your little friends, okay?

05:15.493 --> 05:17.131
Just listen.

05:17.293 --> 05:19.170
See, the grasshopper goofed off...

05:19.333 --> 05:22.052
...while the ant worked hard
storing up food for the winter.

05:22.253 --> 05:24.642
When the winter came,
the ant had food...

05:24.813 --> 05:27.202
...but the grasshopper starved
to death.

05:27.373 --> 05:29.284
You know what the moral
of the story is?

05:29.813 --> 05:33.010
Yup, even if we were insects,
I'd be bigger than you.

05:41.093 --> 05:46.963
All hail, the king of cram
is about to take his throne.

05:49.253 --> 05:50.971
This is really sad, Will.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.727
It's 10:30 and you're just now
cracking open that book.

05:53.893 --> 05:57.090
No, that's not true. I cracked it earlier
when I had to write down...

05:57.253 --> 06:00.245
...this honey's phone number
right next to the periodical table.

06:00.413 --> 06:02.324
Do you wanna hear a little
chemistry rhyme?

06:02.493 --> 06:03.892
No, not really.

06:04.093 --> 06:05.242
Here.

06:05.413 --> 06:07.768
<i>Little Timmy took a drink
But he will drink no more</i>

06:07.933 --> 06:10.891
<i>For what he thought was H2O
Was H2SO4</i>

06:11.093 --> 06:13.732
That's how I remember the equation
for sulphuric acid.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.733
Oh, look, look. I got one. I got one.

06:16.893 --> 06:19.851
<i>Little Carlton was a boy
Whose body was short and stumpy</i>

06:20.013 --> 06:23.608
<i>He never shut his mouth
So I kicked his little rumpy</i>

06:38.173 --> 06:39.970
Are you quite finished?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.010
Yup, all ready.

06:50.213 --> 06:52.932
Hey, Carlton, that's really annoying.

06:53.133 --> 06:55.693
Oh, sorry, nervous habit.

07:06.573 --> 07:09.041
Sorry, nervous habit.

07:11.693 --> 07:13.206
Fool.

07:14.373 --> 07:17.171
I am so sorry, Geoffrey,
but if I put him down...

07:17.333 --> 07:19.005
...he cries even harder.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.050
So would you mind
making up more formula?

07:21.213 --> 07:24.683
Mind? Madame, you woke me
from a most marvelous dream.

07:24.853 --> 07:29.131
I haven't had one this good since
I was strip searched at Dulles Airport.

07:33.573 --> 07:37.771
"Welcome to the exciting world
of chemistry."

07:42.333 --> 07:44.369
Honey, could you hold Nicky
just a second?

07:44.533 --> 07:46.763
Wait, Aunt Viv, come on, l...

07:47.693 --> 07:49.092
He stopped.

07:49.533 --> 07:52.172
Well, these fingers can work magic.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.801
Ain't that what the honeys
tell me, huh?

07:55.933 --> 07:59.005
- Okay, it's 10:37. I'm calling the police.
- Philip.

07:59.173 --> 08:02.483
Police don't need your hysterical calls
cluttering up their phone lines.

08:02.653 --> 08:04.803
They've got to catch real criminals.

08:04.973 --> 08:06.770
Like the murderous muggers
and thugs...

08:06.933 --> 08:09.242
...that hang around
movie theaters after hours.

08:09.413 --> 08:12.166
She's at the mall.
She's not at the Pussycat Theater.

08:12.333 --> 08:15.882
I've never seen a mugger
at the Pussycat Theater.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.971
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Banks.</i>

08:20.173 --> 08:21.208
Can I speak to Ashley?

08:21.373 --> 08:23.603
<i>She's not home from her date.
She was supposed...</i>

08:23.773 --> 08:26.241
- Daddy, I got it.
- Ashley, sweetheart, where are you?

08:26.453 --> 08:27.932
I'm upstairs in my room.

08:28.093 --> 08:29.651
I got home 20 minutes ago.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.373
Come on, hang up,
I wanna talk to Connie about my date.

08:32.533 --> 08:34.568
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

08:34.773 --> 08:36.410
All right, sweetheart, good night.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.681
This is too easy.

08:40.332 --> 08:42.005
Are you ready?

08:44.053 --> 08:46.203
Don't I feel like an idiot?

08:46.373 --> 08:49.683
Ashley got home 20 minutes ago.
She's upstairs talking on the phone.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.245
Oh, really?

08:52.853 --> 08:54.684
That's a load off my mind.

08:54.853 --> 08:56.206
I think I'll go to bed.

08:56.373 --> 08:58.443
- Good night, Geoffrey.
- Good night, sir.

08:58.613 --> 09:00.092
Idiot.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.562
Maybe you can hold on to Nicky
till he falls asleep.

09:03.733 --> 09:07.169
Well, no, Aunt Viv, listen,
I can't. I have to study.

09:08.653 --> 09:10.609
You can't study if the baby is crying.

09:10.773 --> 09:13.571
It shouldn't take long.
He hasn't slept all day.

09:14.213 --> 09:15.885
All right.

09:16.213 --> 09:20.126
You are getting sleepy.

09:20.893 --> 09:26.172
Very, very sleepy.

09:26.333 --> 09:30.246
Your eyelids are getting heavier.

09:30.813 --> 09:35.250
Your little head is drooping.

09:38.653 --> 09:40.644
Hi, I'm back.

09:45.173 --> 09:47.482
Maybe we should just try a bottle
and a warm bath.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.087
Thought you'd never ask.

09:50.893 --> 09:52.690
The coffee commercial went great.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.923
First, I take a big sip of coffee,
then I say:

09:55.133 --> 09:56.930
Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, TV weather girl.

09:57.093 --> 09:58.526
When I don't have my head
in the clouds...

09:58.693 --> 10:00.729
...I like to relax with a nice
hot cup of Casual Cup coffee.

10:00.893 --> 10:03.043
So rich and fine, tastes just like
you ground the beans yourself.

10:03.213 --> 10:06.330
First take, I said, " Tastes just like
you found the beans yourself."

10:06.493 --> 10:09.644
We did it again, I said, " When I don't
have my head in the crowds."

10:09.813 --> 10:11.326
- So I did it again, and...
- Hilary.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.444
How many takes did you do?

10:13.653 --> 10:15.609
Only 41.
You think that would tire me out.

10:15.773 --> 10:18.128
But I'm more awake now
than when I started.

10:18.453 --> 10:21.604
Stupid question, did you forget
to spit after each take?

10:21.813 --> 10:24.088
Why would I spit it out?
I'm nuts about coffee.

10:24.253 --> 10:27.928
It's not made from nuts, it's from beans,
so I guess I'm beans about coffee.

10:28.733 --> 10:32.521
Oh, gee, I'd love to stay and continue
this fascinating monologue...

10:32.693 --> 10:35.207
...but I have to get
some studying done.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.762
I've always wondered,
if coffee's made from beans...

10:37.933 --> 10:39.685
...does that make it a vegetable?

10:41.013 --> 10:43.083
Why are you following me?

10:43.373 --> 10:46.524
Don't you have to work in the morning?
Shouldn't you go sleep?

10:46.693 --> 10:50.163
I'd love to go to sleep, but I can't.
I'm wide awake. See?

10:52.173 --> 10:55.563
Why don't you try doing something
boring like reading the dictionary?

10:55.733 --> 10:57.564
- Do you have one?
- Of course, I do.

10:57.733 --> 11:00.531
What do you think
is propping up my makeup table?

11:06.613 --> 11:08.524
Finally.

11:28.073 --> 11:30.143
- Carlton, I need your earplugs, man.
- Hey!

11:30.313 --> 11:32.269
Come on, man.
Listen, I can't concentrate.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.663
I read that same sentence
like two million times.

11:34.833 --> 11:36.232
If this test covers more than:

11:36.393 --> 11:38.987
"Welcome to the exciting world
of chemistry", I'm done.

11:39.193 --> 11:41.468
Maybe next time you should
promise to yourself...

11:41.633 --> 11:43.783
...not to put things off
until the last minute.

11:44.593 --> 11:47.266
You know what? You're right, man.

11:47.433 --> 11:50.106
And I've been wanting
to squeeze your peezy little head...

11:50.273 --> 11:53.470
...like a grape all day long,
and now is as good a time as any.

11:53.673 --> 11:54.867
Give me those earplugs.

11:55.033 --> 11:56.352
Give me your earplugs, man.

11:56.513 --> 11:58.424
I'm not sharing anything
with you, mister.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.823
Who knows where those ears
have been?

12:00.993 --> 12:03.268
That's it. That's it.
Come here. Come here.

12:03.433 --> 12:06.266
Get over here.
Get over here. Get over.

12:09.233 --> 12:10.552
Time-out, Ashley's home.

12:10.753 --> 12:14.063
Ashley? I thought she was
supposed to be upstairs in bed.

12:14.233 --> 12:18.067
Yeah, you also thought Tupac Shakur
was a Jewish holiday.

12:22.273 --> 12:23.786
Why is everybody still up?

12:23.953 --> 12:26.945
You know, you're making it
very difficult for me to sneak in.

12:27.113 --> 12:30.822
Ashley, even you should know
if you're trying to get past Uncle Phil...

12:30.993 --> 12:33.348
...you don't go through the kitchen.

12:33.913 --> 12:35.505
I guess I have a lot to learn.

12:35.833 --> 12:37.152
No, you learn too much.

12:37.313 --> 12:39.508
What you doing trying to run
my phone scam for?

12:39.713 --> 12:40.941
Well, it worked.

12:41.113 --> 12:42.865
That's not the point.

12:43.073 --> 12:46.952
Look, the point is you don't realize
the dangers that are lurking out there.

12:47.113 --> 12:50.583
Look, Ashley, listen.
Guys are only after two things.

12:50.793 --> 12:52.465
I thought they were only after one.

12:52.673 --> 12:55.745
Well, yeah, but they wanna do it
more than once.

12:56.193 --> 12:59.424
- That noise is driving me crazy!
- Daddy's up?

13:00.953 --> 13:02.989
Get down, hide, hide. Get down.

13:05.273 --> 13:07.628
I can't stand all that chirping.

13:07.793 --> 13:09.749
Geoffrey! Geoffrey!

13:10.713 --> 13:12.271
You rang?

13:12.793 --> 13:14.909
Where did you last put
the insecticide?

13:15.073 --> 13:16.904
In your soup.

13:17.633 --> 13:19.351
Boy, you're a grumpy Gus.

13:20.073 --> 13:22.826
I was having a most wonderful dream.

13:22.993 --> 13:26.303
Amazon women had just bound me
with sinuous vines...

13:26.473 --> 13:29.033
...and were taunting me
with tangelos.

13:29.233 --> 13:30.825
What the hell is a tangelo?

13:30.993 --> 13:33.223
"'Tangelo', the fruit
of a hybrid citrus tree...

13:33.393 --> 13:37.181
...that is a cross between certain
varieties of grapefruit and tangerine."

13:37.513 --> 13:39.504
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

13:39.713 --> 13:42.591
I never knew how much fun
I could have reading the dictionary.

13:42.753 --> 13:44.744
I mean, it's filled
with all kinds of words.

13:44.913 --> 13:48.303
Big words, little words,
abbreviations, common phrases.

13:48.473 --> 13:50.191
Can I look up a word for you?

13:51.073 --> 13:54.383
- Go away.
- Oh, that's two words.

13:54.993 --> 13:58.303
- This will take care of that little sucker.
- Sir, that's air freshener.

13:58.473 --> 14:00.987
Well, it's all we have. It might work.

14:01.353 --> 14:04.106
Yes, perhaps the scent
of sea breeze...

14:04.273 --> 14:08.391
...will recall some painful memory
for him, and then he'll commit suicide.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.550
Quick, get in here!

14:15.793 --> 14:17.829
You were lucky
Uncle Phil didn't catch you.

14:18.113 --> 14:19.831
Well, there's still time.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.751
What's that supposed to mean?

14:21.913 --> 14:23.949
Remember last year
when I skipped school...

14:24.113 --> 14:26.581
...so I could pre-register
for jury duty?

14:28.353 --> 14:30.423
And a little somebody
snitched on me?

14:30.593 --> 14:33.585
Well, missy,
the tables have finally turned.

14:34.553 --> 14:36.623
Oh, Carlton, you're evil, man.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.710
Please, don't tell, I'll do anything.

14:38.873 --> 14:41.592
I'll clean your room.
I'll polish your Star Trek figurines.

14:41.753 --> 14:44.267
<i>No. Now it's coming from the kitchen.</i>

14:44.433 --> 14:46.424
Get down, get down!

14:47.633 --> 14:50.909
That cricket sounds like it's coming
from two places at once.

14:51.073 --> 14:53.826
Must be the ventriloquist
of the animal kingdom.

14:54.033 --> 14:58.231
You know, Dad, I think it's coming
from this side of the counter.

15:01.113 --> 15:02.592
No, you know, Uncle Phil...

15:02.753 --> 15:06.189
...I think he's over here,
the sneaky little bugger.

15:08.433 --> 15:09.752
I was right the first time.

15:09.913 --> 15:11.869
It's coming from the family room.
Come on.

15:12.033 --> 15:14.342
I'll hunt that cricket
if it's the last thing I do.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.983
His head will make a fine trophy, sir.

15:19.233 --> 15:20.507
Carlton, you stink.

15:20.673 --> 15:23.665
You just go ahead outside.
I'll go upstairs and get your pajamas.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.825
You can put them on and pretend
you just came down for a snack.

15:28.273 --> 15:31.709
My God, that bug isn't gonna get
the best of me.

15:32.033 --> 15:35.912
Now I know how Captain Ahab felt
when he was chasing Moby Dick.

15:36.313 --> 15:40.226
Between the two of you,
the cricket is the whale?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.626
Geoffrey.

15:42.793 --> 15:45.944
- How'd you like to be unemployed?
- What do you mean?

15:46.113 --> 15:49.105
"Unemployed. Out of work,
jobless, not being used.

15:49.273 --> 15:52.470
I.E., a person
who does not have a job."

15:53.113 --> 15:55.673
See, the answer is right
at your fingertips.

15:58.993 --> 16:01.746
- Here. Put those on.
- Okay.

16:06.873 --> 16:09.262
Oh, man, I don't believe this.

16:10.273 --> 16:14.061
- Oh, my God, it's 1:30.
- That's true.

16:14.633 --> 16:17.272
And it's a shame you always
have to learn the hard way.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.630
As for me,
I'm just finishing my paper.

16:21.713 --> 16:22.941
Can't stand it anymore.

16:23.393 --> 16:28.103
This chirping is boring a hole
straight into my skull.

16:28.273 --> 16:29.501
There she blows, captain.

16:29.673 --> 16:32.506
By the table! By the table!

16:36.913 --> 16:38.346
I got him.

16:38.553 --> 16:40.783
I killed that little sucker.

16:45.953 --> 16:48.626
Philip, stop charging about
like a rogue elephant.

16:48.793 --> 16:51.944
- You're lucky you didn't wake Nicky up.
- My paper.

16:52.113 --> 16:55.105
Thirty pages of genius gone.

16:55.273 --> 16:59.391
Oh, well. I guess sometimes
that little hardworking head...

16:59.553 --> 17:02.226
...just gets squashed
into a little black spot, huh?

17:02.393 --> 17:03.508
That's funny, ain't it?

17:03.673 --> 17:06.471
Listen, you did all this hard work,
I didn't do anything...

17:06.633 --> 17:08.703
...and we're both in the same boat.

17:10.792 --> 17:14.148
- Except that my paper was optional.
- Optional?

17:14.353 --> 17:17.106
Yeah, I was only doing it
to get in good with the professor.

17:17.272 --> 17:20.663
Oh, well, I guess I'll just have
to bring him some cupcakes.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.991
Hello.

17:25.153 --> 17:27.144
This is Philip Banks.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.910
Well, no, I haven't seen Randy...

17:30.073 --> 17:32.223
...and Ashley's been home
since 10:30.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.745
Well, I'll call you back
if she knows anything.

17:38.993 --> 17:40.221
That was Randy's father.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.668
Apparently, Randy decided
to go somewhere else...

17:42.833 --> 17:44.312
...after dropping Ashley off.

17:44.473 --> 17:46.304
Thank God I have a responsible child.

17:48.633 --> 17:50.589
Hey, hey, hey!

17:50.753 --> 17:52.027
Hey.

17:52.193 --> 17:54.070
Hey, man.

17:54.233 --> 17:55.712
Where are you going?

17:55.873 --> 17:58.865
I'm gonna go ask Ashley
if she knows where Randy went.

17:59.073 --> 18:02.543
Oh, man, you're not gonna
just go up there...

18:02.713 --> 18:04.465
...and wake her up, are you?

18:04.633 --> 18:07.864
I mean, she could already
have morning breath.

18:08.033 --> 18:09.705
Will, please.

18:11.553 --> 18:13.828
Randy's father has a very
serious problem.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.223
If she did something like that,
I'd throttle her.

18:16.433 --> 18:20.346
No, no, no. Throttling isn't
anything like killing, is it?

18:20.553 --> 18:24.148
Not exactly. The second definition
of throttle is, "To strangle, choke."

18:24.313 --> 18:26.907
Killing is the result of throttling.

18:28.033 --> 18:31.230
Either way, I think we're
about to see a demonstration.

18:31.433 --> 18:33.230
Ashley's not in her room!

18:33.553 --> 18:36.704
I'm right here, Daddy. I was just
in the kitchen getting a snack.

18:36.993 --> 18:38.745
We were just in the kitchen.

18:39.993 --> 18:44.464
- I mean the kitchen in the pool house.
- The pool house is being fumigated.

18:47.473 --> 18:48.747
Where am I?

18:48.913 --> 18:50.585
What am I doing down here?

18:51.393 --> 18:53.304
I must have been sleepwalking.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.506
I better go back to my room.

18:56.713 --> 18:58.431
Ashley.

18:58.753 --> 19:01.551
You've already lied once tonight.
Let's not make it a habit.

19:01.793 --> 19:03.909
Daddy, none of my other friends
had a curfew.

19:04.073 --> 19:07.463
If I came home at 10:30,
everyone would think I was a baby.

19:07.633 --> 19:09.828
You have to realize
that I'm growing up.

19:09.993 --> 19:11.949
Sweetheart, I am your father.

19:12.113 --> 19:13.705
It is my job to protect you.

19:13.873 --> 19:17.422
It's a job I refuse to quit,
and at which I can't afford to fail.

19:18.273 --> 19:19.501
I'm sorry.

19:19.713 --> 19:20.941
I won't do it again.

19:21.713 --> 19:24.022
Of course, you won't, sweetheart.

19:24.193 --> 19:26.832
- Because you're grounded for 10 years.
- Ten years?

19:26.993 --> 19:29.746
Or whenever you move out
of the house. Whatever comes first.

19:29.913 --> 19:32.905
- That's not fair.
- Tell it to the judge.

19:33.073 --> 19:34.791
Oh, that's me.

19:38.793 --> 19:41.148
I killed the cricket.

19:41.673 --> 19:44.346
What a horrible death.

19:44.513 --> 19:46.902
- But, Dad, you can't do that to me.
- Watch me.

19:47.113 --> 19:48.228
But, no!

19:48.393 --> 19:49.746
<i>Ding-dong, the cricket's dead</i>

19:49.913 --> 19:51.790
<i>Ashley's grounded
Now you all go to bed</i>

19:51.993 --> 19:54.985
Will, the house is all yours.
Come on, guys.

20:03.473 --> 20:06.988
"Welcome to the exciting world
of chemistry."

20:11.033 --> 20:12.751
Come on, Dad, 10 years?

20:12.913 --> 20:15.108
The Menendez brothers
will be free before I am.

20:15.273 --> 20:18.390
The Menendez brothers
got home on time.

20:24.033 --> 20:26.342
Will, wake up.

20:26.553 --> 20:29.272
Welcome to the exciting world
of chemistry.

20:29.433 --> 20:30.946
Will, it's 8:00.

20:31.113 --> 20:33.832
You don't have much time
to get changed and get to school.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.071
Oh, man.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.349
I never even got past the first page.

20:38.553 --> 20:42.023
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Carlton, I'm gonna fail.

20:44.433 --> 20:46.947
Hate to say, I told you so.

20:50.673 --> 20:53.107
So how'd the test go, Will?

20:53.433 --> 20:55.503
I got an 85.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.988
What? But you didn't even study.

20:58.153 --> 21:01.429
How could you have learned everything
you had to know about chemistry?

21:01.593 --> 21:03.823
Well, the only chemistry I needed...

21:03.993 --> 21:06.223
...was between me
and the honey in the next seat.

21:06.393 --> 21:07.826
You know what I'm saying?

21:08.033 --> 21:10.024
You have a good winter.

21:11.553 --> 21:12.781
Wait a second, Will.

21:12.953 --> 21:16.150
You're not really gonna let people
think you cheated?

21:17.073 --> 21:20.463
Yeah, I know. I know.
You're right. You're right.

21:23.153 --> 21:25.064
- Ready?
- Yeah.

21:25.713 --> 21:29.228
- So how'd the test go, Will?
- I failed.

21:29.753 --> 21:33.063
See, Will, you can't put studying off
until the last minute.

21:33.273 --> 21:35.468
I know, I know, you're right.

21:35.673 --> 21:38.551
You know what?
I'm gonna run to the library right now.

21:38.713 --> 21:41.944
And I'm not leaving until I learn
everything to know about chemistry.

21:42.153 --> 21:43.347
That's the spirit.

21:51.273 --> 21:53.184
Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, TV weather girl.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.468
When I don't have my head
in the clouds...

21:54.633 --> 21:56.942
...I like to relax
with a nice hot cup of...

21:57.673 --> 21:59.470
- Cup of hot coffee.
- From the top.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.431
Well, at first I said...
Oh, shoot. Damn it.

22:02.593 --> 22:04.345
- Then what did you say?
- I forgot.

22:04.513 --> 22:08.665
And the next take I said, " When I
don't have my..." Oh, shoot, shoot.

22:08.833 --> 22:10.949
- And the next thing I said...
- Hilary...

22:11.113 --> 22:12.512
...how many takes did you do?

22:12.713 --> 22:14.624
Only 41.
You think that would tire me out.

22:14.793 --> 22:17.432
But I'm more awake now
than when we started.

22:21.113 --> 22:23.581
I'm gonna pass out, you know.
