<i>GRACE: Previously on
The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.900 --> 00:04.733
It wasn't easy
to find a couple
that I liked.

00:04.884 --> 00:05.764
I'm just
looking out for you.

00:05.897 --> 00:06.803
I can look out
for myself.

00:07.958 --> 00:09.825
So why can't
you guys have kids?

00:09.860 --> 00:12.028
You slept with Alice
while we were dating?

00:12.062 --> 00:13.062
It was an accident.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.965
Oh, this creep
hassled Adrian before.

00:15.999 --> 00:17.099
What kind of creep?

00:17.134 --> 00:19.035
Some pimp on
a recruiting mission.

00:19.069 --> 00:21.103
What if the couple
backs out because of you?

00:21.138 --> 00:22.838
We've got to
apologize to Henry.

00:22.873 --> 00:24.073
You're missing out.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.008
The girls are here.
They're walking the halls.

00:26.043 --> 00:27.043
There's a party?
If you've got the money.

00:27.077 --> 00:30.079
Do you have any idea
how dangerous pimps are?

00:30.113 --> 00:32.048
If I scream,
how much can
you come up with?

00:32.082 --> 00:33.516
How old are you?

00:33.550 --> 00:35.351
Fifteen-year-old-girl
nabbed by some guy,
turned into a prostitute.

00:35.385 --> 00:39.088
That's like treating a woman
as if she's property.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.089
I swear,
I didn't do anything.

00:40.123 --> 00:40.990
<i>She's a kid.</i>

00:41.024 --> 00:42.358
You're the best
husband in the world.

00:42.392 --> 00:44.160
I'm not your husband.

00:44.194 --> 00:45.227
We have to do
something about that.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.096
I apologize
for what happened.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.130
If you want to
go out with Dylan,

00:48.165 --> 00:49.365
then may the best man win.

00:49.399 --> 00:52.068
I'm sorry
about the way I've acted.

00:52.102 --> 00:54.270
Sometimes
I don't like that
couple either.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.338
I just have to suck it up,
because they're really going
to be good parents.

01:07.350 --> 01:07.416
And you're live.

01:10.287 --> 01:13.322
We're here watching
Christian quarterback
sensation Jack Pappas,

01:13.356 --> 01:16.092
who bravely stepped forward
last week and spoke out

01:16.126 --> 01:17.526
against girls
who are being trafficked,

01:17.561 --> 01:21.230
a problem he found himself
coping with
when hookers were brought in

01:21.264 --> 01:24.200
to the athletic dorm
at this college campus.

01:24.234 --> 01:27.369
When police arrived,
Jack encouraged
a 15-year-old girl

01:27.404 --> 01:29.371
to come forward
and tell her story,

01:29.406 --> 01:33.275
a girl who was since
reunited with her family.

01:33.310 --> 01:37.079
The man who held her captive
for the past two years
is still at large.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.248
Jack, how are you?

01:39.282 --> 01:41.350
I'm doing well, thank you.

01:41.384 --> 01:43.185
Hope we're getting ready
to win the big game
this weekend.

01:43.220 --> 01:45.287
So, Jack,
I understand that
you're a Christian,

01:45.322 --> 01:47.123
or is this just a play
to get some publicity

01:47.157 --> 01:49.225
for the school
by mimicking Tebow?

01:49.259 --> 01:51.193
Oh, I could only
hope to mimic Tim Tebow.

01:51.228 --> 01:54.296
He's a good man.
He's a good example for
anyone involved in sports.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.198
So, in fact,
you are a Christian?

01:56.233 --> 01:58.167
I am.
And I understand
your girlfriend,

01:58.201 --> 02:00.069
who's a high school senior,
is also a Christian.

02:00.103 --> 02:01.437
Come on over here, Grace.

02:01.471 --> 02:05.007
Yeah, she is, in fact,
she's really responsible
for my being who I am.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.275
More so than your dad
who's a minister?

02:06.309 --> 02:08.110
Yeah.

02:08.145 --> 02:10.012
Hi Grace, it's Grace,
isn't it?

02:10.045 --> 02:12.248
Yes, it is.

02:12.282 --> 02:13.315
Were you surprised
that your boyfriend here

02:13.350 --> 02:15.151
was caught with a prostitute
in his room?

02:15.185 --> 02:18.320
Well, that doesn't
sound like what happened,
now does it?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.356
The girl approached me,
she was panicked,

02:20.390 --> 02:22.391
she was trying to meet
a quota for the night.

02:22.425 --> 02:25.294
I didn't know
about these things,
she told me.

02:25.328 --> 02:28.397
Anyway, she practically
begged me to hire her,
but I couldn't.

02:28.431 --> 02:31.100
I was going to give her
whatever cash I had on me

02:31.134 --> 02:33.102
to keep her from
going to anyone else,
and about that time,

02:33.136 --> 02:35.137
the police arrived,
and because

02:35.172 --> 02:37.373
she was underage
and in a lot of danger,

02:37.407 --> 02:39.308
I encouraged her
to tell the police

02:39.342 --> 02:41.410
so she could get back home
safe to her family.

02:41.444 --> 02:44.146
So as Christians,
I guess the two of you

02:44.181 --> 02:46.382
don't believe
in premarital sex, do you?

02:46.416 --> 02:49.151
Do we believe that
it exists? Yes.

02:49.186 --> 02:50.119
Do we believe
it's the best thing for us

02:50.153 --> 02:52.388
at this point
in our relationship?
No.

02:52.422 --> 02:56.058
So you two,
you've never had sex
with each other?

02:56.092 --> 02:59.128
Well, we had sex before,
a couple of years ago,

02:59.162 --> 03:00.095
and it was great,
but as it turned out,

03:00.130 --> 03:02.198
it wrecked our relationship.

03:02.232 --> 03:05.334
(MUTTERING) On camera.
We are on camera,

03:05.368 --> 03:08.270
Fortunately,
we got back together
and saw the light

03:08.305 --> 03:11.407
and now I'm committed
to abstinence
for the time being.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.044
Good luck with that.

03:15.078 --> 03:18.214
And good luck
with the big game
next weekend.

03:18.248 --> 03:22.017
Well, I wasn't expecting
to uncover the best part
of the story.

03:22.052 --> 03:23.385
Unintentional scoop.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.354
Back to you in the newsroom.

03:25.388 --> 03:26.422
What the hell
were you thinking?

03:30.126 --> 03:34.230

03:52.315 --> 03:55.050
Good advice for anyone.
What does that mean?

03:55.085 --> 03:58.387
Nothing, just making your

04:03.159 --> 04:05.194
Yeah, I'm afraid
that might be true.

04:05.228 --> 04:06.128
You may  one of
those girls who is smart

04:06.162 --> 04:08.264
and works hard
in high school

04:08.298 --> 04:10.199
and has plans
and dreams of

04:10.233 --> 04:12.167
going to college
and getting a degree

04:12.202 --> 04:14.336
in medicine
and becoming a doctor,

04:14.371 --> 04:16.105
only she gets involved
with some football player,

04:16.139 --> 04:18.140
falls in love,
gets pregnant

04:18.173 --> 04:19.274
and ends up not
going to college

04:19.309 --> 04:20.108
until the children
are grown

04:20.142 --> 04:22.278
and she's divorced
from the husband

04:22.312 --> 04:23.312
and has to make
her own living.

04:24.281 --> 04:26.315
How long have you
been holding that in?

04:26.349 --> 04:27.383
Not that long.
Okay, well,

04:27.417 --> 04:31.020
I will be going to college
and becoming a doctor,

04:31.054 --> 04:32.187
skipping med camp
to wreck my life.

04:34.124 --> 04:35.190
(SIGHS ANGRILY)

04:35.225 --> 04:37.259
(MUTTERING)
to med camp! Ugh! go

04:37.294 --> 04:38.160
Saw you on
the morning news!

04:40.063 --> 04:43.132
Did they, um...

04:43.166 --> 04:45.000
Did they play
the whole thing?

04:45.035 --> 04:46.235
You mean the part
where you said,

04:46.269 --> 04:49.171
"What the hell are you doing?"
after the part

04:49.205 --> 04:52.107
where Jack had said
in high school?

04:54.311 --> 04:57.046
I'm always here
if you want to talk.

04:59.149 --> 05:01.317
Wendy's dad just
pulled her out of school?

05:01.351 --> 05:03.285
What!
Oh, yeah,

05:03.320 --> 05:05.120
she is out as of today
and he's putting her back

05:05.155 --> 05:08.023
in another private school
not want her here,

05:08.058 --> 05:10.225
and doesn't want her
hanging out with us anymore.

05:10.260 --> 05:13.095
Well, that's insulting!
What did we do?

05:13.129 --> 05:15.164
Where should I begin?

05:15.198 --> 05:18.300
Let me see... Oh!
We got busted for pot!

05:18.335 --> 05:20.202
She wasn't smoking,
we were.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.005
She was with us.
So?

05:23.039 --> 05:26.008
So it wasn't the first time.
We've gotten caught before.

05:26.042 --> 05:27.209
He doesn't know
about before,

05:27.243 --> 05:28.243
it can't be the pot.

05:28.278 --> 05:30.279
Maybe it
could be the fire,

05:30.313 --> 05:33.115
the possibility
you and Ben burned
down the school.

05:33.149 --> 05:36.118
No, we didn't,
it was a faulty gas line.

05:36.152 --> 05:39.088
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
It was a faulty gas line

05:39.122 --> 05:41.156
or someone's rich daddy
got the authorities to lie.

05:41.191 --> 05:42.057
My dad would never do that.

05:42.092 --> 05:45.060
Yeah, he would.
And so would Ben's.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.128
But neither of them did.

05:47.197 --> 05:48.230
Is that what people think?

05:48.264 --> 05:49.331
I don't know,

05:49.366 --> 05:52.034
but maybe that's what
Cop Pop thinks.

05:52.068 --> 05:54.203
And maybe Wendy's dad
knows something we don't.

05:54.237 --> 05:56.038
Oh, that's ridiculous.

05:56.072 --> 05:59.008
No one paid anyone off,
it was an accident.

05:59.042 --> 06:01.176
Well, the headline
in the newspaper
about Jack being involved

06:01.211 --> 06:02.177
with a hooker really
sent him over the line.

06:02.212 --> 06:05.280
We don't have anything
to do with that,

06:05.315 --> 06:06.215
with Jack or with...

06:08.251 --> 06:10.986
Oh, yeah,
Raven dated Jack.

06:11.021 --> 06:12.221
But he saved that hooker!

06:12.255 --> 06:14.923
Go back to Raven dated Jack.

06:14.958 --> 06:15.991
We've all been around Jack,

06:16.026 --> 06:20.929
and he is in
visiting Grace and...e

06:20.964 --> 06:22.297
Well, hookers
are dangerous.

06:22.332 --> 06:25.300
Drugs, arson,
hookers and pimps,

06:25.335 --> 06:29.204
I think it all added up
yanked out of school.

06:29.239 --> 06:31.940
I'm late
called my mom.s dad

06:31.975 --> 06:34.043
And he's going
Mercedes,our dad,

06:34.077 --> 06:35.210
and he's going to call
your mom and dad, Dylan.

06:35.245 --> 06:37.279
Because?
Because?

06:37.313 --> 06:40.015
(SIGHS) Because he didn't
from her friends,y away

06:40.050 --> 06:43.018
but he's sending her

06:45.021 --> 06:47.122
to an all girl's school.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.223
(SIGHS)

06:52.228 --> 06:54.196
If our parents send us
to an all girl's school,

06:54.230 --> 06:55.330
I may never see Ben again.

06:56.232 --> 06:57.966
Or Henry.

06:58.001 --> 06:58.067
I vote Henry.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.171
Dylan?

07:03.039 --> 07:04.206
What?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.108
If he doesn't want her
to hang out with us,

07:06.142 --> 07:08.110
they're not going to send us
to the same school as her.

07:08.144 --> 07:10.212
There are plenty of
private girl's schools,

07:10.246 --> 07:12.147
maybe he has a list.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.049
I'm not going
to another school,

07:14.084 --> 07:15.150
I don't care
what my parents say,

07:15.185 --> 07:16.085
I'm staying right here.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.190
So are you going out
with her or not?

07:21.224 --> 07:23.926
Uh, I asked her out,
she turned me down.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.060
Are you going out with her?

07:25.095 --> 07:27.062
Truthfully,

07:27.097 --> 07:28.130
only to get back
at you and Alice.

07:28.164 --> 07:31.133
You don't like Dylan?

07:31.167 --> 07:34.002
It's not that
I don't like her,
it's just that

07:34.037 --> 07:35.938
I never should
have broken up
with Alice

07:35.972 --> 07:36.905
and then I never would
have slept with Adrian

07:36.940 --> 07:39.007
and you never would have
slept with Alice

07:39.042 --> 07:41.043
and then our lives
would not be so screwed up!

07:41.077 --> 07:43.045
(SIGHS) Or we could have
waited until we were out
of high school to have sex.

07:43.079 --> 07:45.080
Too late for that.
(CHUCKLES)

07:53.957 --> 07:54.957
Hello.

07:54.991 --> 07:56.959
Oh. Uh... Hello.

07:56.993 --> 07:58.127
Did you get
any interesting
mail lately?

07:58.161 --> 08:00.929
No.

08:00.964 --> 08:02.197
I got a copy of a letter
of acceptance for you

08:02.232 --> 08:05.868
to a school that I always
wanted to go to.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.202
Hudson University
in New York.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.204
Really?
Congratulations.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.073
That's an early acceptance.

08:11.107 --> 08:14.009
And that probably means
you're going to
have several choices

08:14.043 --> 08:17.045
by next spring
because that's a tough
school to get into.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.182
That makes me
very happy. (CHUCKLES)

08:20.216 --> 08:22.084
It wasn't my first choice,

08:22.118 --> 08:24.052
but that makes me very happy.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.254
What was your first choice?

08:25.288 --> 08:28.157
Whatever school
Amy Juergens Underwood
gets into.

08:28.191 --> 08:32.126
And don't tell me
to just let go of Amy.

08:32.162 --> 08:33.095
I'm sick of people
telling me to let go of Amy.

08:33.129 --> 08:35.998
I don't want to
let go of Amy.

08:36.032 --> 08:40.169
I know I can't have
a real relationship
with anybody else until I do,

08:40.203 --> 08:42.171
but every relationship
I've ever been in

08:42.205 --> 08:46.008
has just been to kill time
until my turn comes around
again,

08:46.042 --> 08:48.210
and it will,
I know it will.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.214
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

08:56.252 --> 08:58.020
I'm not afraid of
falling in love with you.

08:59.923 --> 09:03.058
I know, Ethan.
I thought about it,

09:04.227 --> 09:06.929
and I'm afraid.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.997
I'm afraid you'd only
fall in love with me
because I'm pregnant.

09:09.032 --> 09:10.933
I'm afraid you won't be
so in love with me

09:10.967 --> 09:13.101
when I'm not pregnant,
and when I don't have a baby.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.205
I like you, but come on,
it's weird that you like me.

09:16.239 --> 09:19.208
I more than like you,

09:19.242 --> 09:21.043
and I would more than
like you if you weren't
having a baby.

09:21.077 --> 09:23.011
Are you kidding me?

09:23.046 --> 09:25.047
Remember, I was attracted
to you from the back.

09:25.081 --> 09:27.149
I didn't even see
that you were pregnant.

09:27.183 --> 09:29.051
The baby has nothing
to do with it.

09:29.085 --> 09:31.186
I'm sorry,
but I just think
it would be better

09:31.221 --> 09:32.988
if you and I don't see
each other again

09:33.022 --> 09:34.189
until after
the baby comes.

09:34.224 --> 09:36.091
Oh. So you just decided.

09:37.227 --> 09:38.260
It's not even up
for discussion.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.971
This is not your idea!
I know it's not your idea!

09:49.005 --> 09:50.072
It's that stupid
couple's idea!

09:54.303 --> 09:54.303
+

09:58.876 --> 09:59.976
I think that's nice.

10:00.010 --> 10:02.078
Amy wanted to
have 50 people,

10:02.112 --> 10:04.881
that's 49,

10:04.915 --> 10:06.182
but I like
having an odd number
of people at tables.

10:06.216 --> 10:08.885
I do too,
that puts all the parents
at one table,

10:08.919 --> 10:11.921
you and George
and Margaret,

10:11.955 --> 10:14.023
and Shaker and Nora
plus the bride and groom.

10:14.058 --> 10:17.894
Oh, wait a minute,
you know what's
wrong with this?

10:17.928 --> 10:20.029
George is gonna
bring Kathleen.
Oh.

10:20.064 --> 10:22.165
And then you'll want
to bring a date,

10:22.199 --> 10:27.170
<i>so we put the bride
and groom at their own
little table and voila,</i>

10:27.204 --> 10:29.038
we're back to seven
at the table.

10:29.073 --> 10:32.141
The only problem being
I probably won't have a date,

10:32.176 --> 10:33.976
I haven't had
one yet anyway.

10:34.011 --> 10:35.111
You need to get out
and meet some people.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.248
Oh, I don't really
know any of your people.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.985
Not anyone
I'd introduce you to anyway.

10:43.020 --> 10:45.054
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

10:45.089 --> 10:46.222
Oh. Sorry.

10:46.256 --> 10:48.024
That's the nurse
in assisted care,
I got to take this.

10:48.058 --> 10:50.893
Come on,
it's pretty funny.

10:50.928 --> 10:52.095
No, it's not going
to be that funny
when she gets here.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.063
That was
really stupid of Jack.

10:54.098 --> 10:55.932
You got to give it to the guy,
he was just being honest,

10:55.966 --> 10:57.033
going off
the top of his head,

10:57.067 --> 10:57.900
wasn't editing
anything for the public.

10:57.935 --> 10:58.935
Well, maybe he should have.

10:58.969 --> 11:00.870
Nah, he came off really well,

11:00.904 --> 11:03.139
like a 19-year-old-guy
who's trying to
do the right thing.

11:03.173 --> 11:05.007
And Grace was cute,
it's kind of sweet

11:05.042 --> 11:06.175
that she was
so embarrassed.

11:06.210 --> 11:08.144
Well, I just hope
it all goes away quickly.

11:08.178 --> 11:09.145
I doubt that.
It's probably going
to be picked up

11:09.179 --> 11:11.848
by every news
and sports show
in the country.

11:11.882 --> 11:13.850
Oh, no!
That can't happen!

11:13.884 --> 11:15.151
Grace will be
completely humiliated.

11:15.185 --> 11:17.019
Why?
Because,

11:17.054 --> 11:18.921
she doesn't want
people to know she had
sex in high school!

11:18.956 --> 11:19.822
She shouldn't care
what people think.

11:19.857 --> 11:20.857
She's doing the right
thing now, so...

11:20.891 --> 11:23.126
George, it's all my fault.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.193
I can't believe
I went along with Marshall

11:24.228 --> 11:28.231
on making her wear
that stupid promise ring.

11:28.265 --> 11:30.867
I mean, it just made sex
so appealing to her!

11:30.901 --> 11:33.169
I think sex is
pretty appealing on its
own and ultimately,

11:33.203 --> 11:35.037
all you can do is tell 'em
how you feel
about having sex

11:35.072 --> 11:36.205
while they're in high school
and then they have to decide,

11:36.240 --> 11:38.241
it's their decision.

11:38.275 --> 11:40.977
Yeah, but do you never
feel guilty about
Amy getting pregnant?

11:41.011 --> 11:43.913
I mean, you never question
whether you should
have tald to her more

11:43.947 --> 11:45.948
or not given her
so much freedom
or anything like that?

11:45.983 --> 11:46.983
Yeah, I felt a little guilty

11:47.017 --> 11:48.918
but really,
I couldn't have gone

11:48.952 --> 11:50.286
to band camp
with her and sat in

11:50.320 --> 11:52.855
on her make-out session
with Ricky
and stopped the two of them.

11:52.890 --> 11:54.924
Maybe I could have
talked to her more
about waiting to have sex,

11:54.958 --> 11:55.825
but it really
wasn't my fault,

11:55.859 --> 11:58.060
I can only be responsible
for myself.

11:58.095 --> 11:59.962
I love Amy and Ashley
and Robie,

11:59.997 --> 12:02.064
but when it comes
down to it,

12:02.099 --> 12:04.000
I wish I'd just
picked up my socks.

12:04.034 --> 12:06.836
Aw.

12:09.006 --> 12:11.808
George, I wish I'd just
picked up your socks.

12:11.842 --> 12:15.812
It really shouldn't have
been that big of a deal.

12:15.846 --> 12:17.180
So, you want to start
thinking about maybe
spending a night together?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.848
Yeah.

12:18.882 --> 12:20.850
Let's do that.

12:20.884 --> 12:22.018

for the wedding.

What was that idiot nurse
thinking in teaching

12:47.244 --> 12:50.213
all of these old people
how to email
and text and tweet?

12:50.247 --> 12:51.948
That they need
cyber-friends

12:51.982 --> 12:53.916
because their families
don't spend time with them?

12:53.951 --> 12:55.885
I spend time
with my mother!

12:55.919 --> 12:58.054
I see her almost every day!

12:58.088 --> 13:02.158

old people get lonely

13:02.192 --> 13:04.093
and it may not be
such a bad thing.

13:04.127 --> 13:07.063
No, it's a bad thing,
I know it's a bad thing.

13:07.097 --> 13:09.832
Let's just take
a "we'll see" attitude,
all right?

You need friends,
girlfriends,

13:14.872 --> 13:15.905
lesbian girlfriends.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.074
Talk to Nora.

13:18.108 --> 13:20.910
I don't think Nora has
a lot of friends,

13:20.944 --> 13:22.979
and she doesn't know
anyone else
to introduce me to.

13:23.013 --> 13:24.013
Else, pray tell?

13:24.047 --> 13:26.182
Nora set me up once,
but it didn't work out.

13:27.117 --> 13:30.119
I ran into my old boyfriend
at the bar and took off.

13:30.153 --> 13:33.055
I can't ask Nora
to fix me up again.

13:33.090 --> 13:35.858
And, geez,
I wish I had never told
my mother anything.

13:35.893 --> 13:37.860
She doesn't even know
who I am half the time.

13:37.895 --> 13:39.161
Okay, well,
are we done here?

13:39.196 --> 13:41.998
No. I want
to have something
to show to Amy.

13:42.032 --> 13:43.065
We are not done here.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.835
Okay. So, flowers.

13:45.869 --> 13:46.903
Yes, flowers.

13:46.937 --> 13:49.839

or something.

16:45.214 --> 16:46.448
Oh? Who's that?

He's this idiot that
fell in love with
this pregnant girl

16:49.251 --> 16:51.453
as a freshman
and then went
a little nutty.

16:51.487 --> 16:54.255
How so?
She was having
another guy's baby,

16:54.290 --> 16:56.358

married to,

16:56.392 --> 16:58.226
and Ben's still
not over her.

and burning down schools
and...

17:01.263 --> 17:02.464
Believe me, he's nuts.

want that to happen

to my boyfriend,
you know?

something I shouldn't have.

17:11.507 --> 17:13.441
You know what, sweetheart?

17:13.476 --> 17:16.176
Maybe you should let him
decide that.

17:16.212 --> 17:18.413
Let him decide whether or not
he wants to get involved,

17:18.446 --> 17:20.315
if he doesn't,
I'm sure he'll tell you.

17:21.517 --> 17:24.152

to tell me he doesn't

17:28.357 --> 17:30.158
want to be involved
with me,

17:30.192 --> 17:33.228
but he won't
because he really
just feels sorry for me

17:33.262 --> 17:35.263
and he doesn't have
the guts to tell me
he doesn't really want

17:35.297 --> 17:37.399
to stick around
so he just does?

17:39.368 --> 17:40.468

filled with regret.

17:43.205 --> 17:45.440
And... I don't know.

to be filled with regret.

A rose is a rose is a rose.

17:50.413 --> 17:53.148
And you're a rose whether
you're having a baby or not,

17:53.182 --> 17:57.519
so if the man loves roses,
well, he loves roses

17:57.553 --> 17:59.387
and there ain't nothin'
you can do about it.

17:59.422 --> 18:02.190
But I did do
something about it,

18:02.224 --> 18:04.325
I broke up with him.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.260
We had just gotten
back together

18:05.294 --> 18:06.461
and then the couple
adopting my baby

18:06.495 --> 18:09.164
suggested I break up
with him, so I did.

18:11.267 --> 18:13.201
And he so knew it.

18:13.235 --> 18:15.270
Ugh.

18:15.304 --> 18:16.438
What's going on?

18:16.472 --> 18:19.107
Oh. There you are.

18:19.141 --> 18:19.574
I got
a little surprise for you.
I'll tell you in the car.

18:19.608 --> 18:21.209
In the car? What?

18:21.243 --> 18:23.344
Come on,
just go with me on this.

18:27.349 --> 18:28.416
Oh. Leo Boykewich.

18:29.485 --> 18:31.119
Nice to meet you.
Take care.

18:31.153 --> 18:35.256
You're a sweetheart
for caring about
what happens to the guy.

18:35.291 --> 18:36.458
You're very considerate,

18:36.492 --> 18:38.460
probably why
he's in love with you.

18:39.462 --> 18:40.261
Bye now.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.367
What was that about?
Nothing.

18:46.402 --> 18:49.170
Kid's all worried
because some guy
is in love with her.

18:49.205 --> 18:51.139
And you told her what?

18:51.173 --> 18:52.273
That he'd be
in love with her

18:52.308 --> 18:54.108
whether or not
she was pregnant.

18:54.143 --> 18:55.410
So you think I would have
fallen in love with Amy

18:55.444 --> 18:57.445
whether or not
she was pregnant?

18:57.480 --> 18:59.047
I thought you thought
you should have
discouraged me from that.

18:59.081 --> 19:00.381
Have you learned nothing
from me and my life?

19:00.416 --> 19:03.051
(LAUGHS)

19:03.085 --> 19:04.185
(SIGHS)

19:04.220 --> 19:08.223
I have learned
plenty from you, Son.

19:08.257 --> 19:10.358
Come on.
Feel like going
to a wedding?

19:10.392 --> 19:13.127
Your wedding?
My wedding. Right now.

19:13.162 --> 19:14.362
Hmm. Mind if I bring
a date or two?

19:15.364 --> 19:17.131
No, not Dylan,

19:17.166 --> 19:19.067
I was just thinking
this might be
the kind of opportunity

19:19.101 --> 19:21.269
that could bring
Henry and Alice and me
all back together.

19:21.303 --> 19:21.636
Hurry up.

19:21.670 --> 19:24.105
(CHUCKLES)

19:28.177 --> 19:29.377
All right, Amy,
I'm leaving for school

19:29.411 --> 19:31.312
and I don't like to talk
on the phone in the car,

19:31.347 --> 19:34.182
but maybe you could
just leave me a message

19:34.216 --> 19:36.451
and let me know
why you're getting a letter
from Hudson University

19:36.485 --> 19:38.453
in New York.
I'm just curious.

19:55.371 --> 19:56.271
(SIGHS)

19:57.951 --> 19:57.951
+

20:01.369 --> 20:02.269
(SIGHS)

20:03.438 --> 20:05.339
Hey!
Where are you going?

20:08.243 --> 20:10.177
I just couldn't decide
if I want coffee or not.

20:10.211 --> 20:12.446
You just wanted to talk
to Clementine
and now I'm here.

20:13.315 --> 20:15.182
No.

20:15.216 --> 20:16.483
I heard you
walked her back
to her dorm.

20:19.588 --> 20:21.488
No, you didn't.
Did you?

20:21.523 --> 20:23.457
What business
is that of yours?

20:23.491 --> 20:26.226
You know I really
did want a coffee

20:26.261 --> 20:27.027
but I didn't
want to talk to you

20:27.062 --> 20:29.196
because you're
a pain in the ass.

20:29.230 --> 20:30.564
Uh-oh, someone's
in a bad mood.

20:30.599 --> 20:32.499
Have a fight with Amy?

20:32.534 --> 20:35.469
Have a fight with Amy?

20:35.503 --> 20:39.206
Hello,
that's no one's business
if I had a fight with Amy,

20:39.240 --> 20:40.240
but I did not have
a fight with Amy, all right?

20:42.277 --> 20:44.445
We shouldn't
have asked him.

20:44.479 --> 20:49.350
(SCOFFS)
Okay, um, "we"?
There's no "we."

20:49.384 --> 20:52.453
I am his former girlfriend.
For years.

20:52.487 --> 20:53.354
I know him a little
better than you do

20:53.388 --> 20:55.522
and I can ask him
anything I want.

20:55.557 --> 20:57.391
You don't know him
better than I do, all right?

20:57.425 --> 20:58.492
I've known him longer.

20:58.526 --> 21:00.394
I've known him
more intimately.

21:00.428 --> 21:00.794
Unless you two
are lying.

21:00.829 --> 21:03.163
I don't lie.

21:03.198 --> 21:05.499
Oh? So when you
met Jack at Amy's,

21:05.533 --> 21:07.167
you had never
met Jack before?

21:07.202 --> 21:08.469
I just didn't want
to put Grace

21:08.503 --> 21:09.336
in an awkward situation
that Jack and I had created.

21:09.371 --> 21:12.306
So you lied.
All right. I lied.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.308
Sometimes I lie.

21:14.342 --> 21:15.376
But I am not lying
when I say I've never
had sex with Ricky.

21:15.410 --> 21:19.246
(CHUCKLES)
Sex with Ricky was
so great for me.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.414
Took me years
to get over him.

21:20.448 --> 21:20.814
But now I'm over him.

21:20.849 --> 21:23.317
Oh, are you?

21:23.351 --> 21:25.285
Mmm. He's like a kid to me
now that I'm with Omar.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.388
Then how come you keep
waiting for him
in the coffee shop?

21:27.422 --> 21:29.256
I wasn't waiting for him.

21:29.290 --> 21:31.225
So you're a liar too.

21:31.259 --> 21:32.292
Hello, ladies.

21:32.327 --> 21:33.394
Hey, sit down.

21:33.428 --> 21:34.495
Oh, I can't.
I'm just grabbing

21:34.529 --> 21:35.496
a couple of
coffees to go.

21:35.530 --> 21:36.363
A couple?

21:36.398 --> 21:38.265
Yeah, Ricky's waiting
for me out front.

21:40.535 --> 21:43.170
So, how's it feel
being a celebrity?

21:43.204 --> 21:46.306
It's okay.
They never caught the guy,
huh? The pimp?

21:46.341 --> 21:48.308
No, but I don't
think he'll be
coming around again.

21:48.343 --> 21:50.477
No, but if he does
and if he follows me home,

21:50.512 --> 21:52.446
he'll have a little
surprise waiting for him.

21:53.181 --> 21:56.350
Uh, Omar's moving in.

21:56.384 --> 21:58.318
To yours and Ben's condo?

21:58.353 --> 22:00.187
What's wrong with that?

22:00.221 --> 22:01.355
Uh, nothing I guess.

22:01.389 --> 22:05.392
We are going to be
having lots and
lots of hot sex.

22:06.494 --> 22:07.661
I don't care.

22:07.696 --> 22:11.432
You know, I saw you
on TV this morning,
on the news.

22:11.466 --> 22:12.566
Yeah, well,
I didn't say people
shouldn't have sex,

22:12.600 --> 22:16.136
I just said it was wrong
for me and Grace right now.

22:16.171 --> 22:17.438
Well, how about for you
and Clementine?

22:17.472 --> 22:19.473
Is it wrong for you
and Clementine?

22:19.507 --> 22:22.209
Honestly, Adrian,
when I think about that
I'm ashamed of myself.

22:22.243 --> 22:23.444
That was the wrong
thing to do.

22:23.478 --> 22:25.446
Okay.
It's not going
to happen again.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.147
All right.
No seriously.

22:27.182 --> 22:29.183
Here you go,
two coffees.

22:29.217 --> 22:33.153
Thanks.

22:33.188 --> 22:36.090
You know, I slept
with him, too.

22:36.124 --> 22:37.291
Tell me something,

22:37.325 --> 22:39.259
do you regret sleeping
with anyone
you've slept with?

22:39.294 --> 22:41.261
Yeah. Maybe Henry.

22:42.263 --> 22:44.364
Ugh.

22:44.399 --> 22:48.302
Leo's mother would be
so happy about this.

22:48.336 --> 22:50.270
Well, I'm ju so touched
that Leo would give me
her ring.

22:50.305 --> 22:52.139
I'm going to give you
everything you want, babe.

22:52.173 --> 22:55.209
Oh, Leo.
You've made me
so happy.

22:55.243 --> 22:58.145
Oh, congratulations you two,

22:58.179 --> 22:59.213
I better get back to work.

23:01.249 --> 23:01.448
Bye.

23:01.483 --> 23:03.350
Bye.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.087
Oh, myod.
That bathroom is enormous.

23:07.122 --> 23:08.388
I wanted to take
a bath in the sink.

23:08.423 --> 23:10.290
Help yourself.

23:10.325 --> 23:11.225
Oh, Nora, I'm so glad
you were here.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.060
Thank you for being
our witness.

23:13.094 --> 23:16.029
And you've done
such a great job
taking over for me.

23:16.064 --> 23:17.231
Oh, I don't know
about that.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.433
I can't imagine
you'd ever be gone
for half the afternoon.

23:22.203 --> 23:24.238
Right.
I better get going.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.339
(LAUGHS) Bye you two.
Love you.

23:25.373 --> 23:28.242
Love the two of you.
Congratulations.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.209
Bye.
Bye.

23:32.147 --> 23:35.048
All right, knock it off
you two lovebirds.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.316
There'll be plenty
of time for that.

23:36.351 --> 23:39.019
So, we didn't have
a wedding cake on hand,

23:39.053 --> 23:40.354
but there was
a frozen sausage pizza.

23:40.388 --> 23:43.323
Pizza pie anyone?

23:43.358 --> 23:46.059
No thanks, my bride and I
are going to take off.

23:46.094 --> 23:47.094
Oh. All right-y.

23:47.128 --> 23:50.164
Well, have
a nice afternoon?
Evening? Week?

23:50.198 --> 23:53.033
We'll be back tomorrow.
And you three
behave yourselves.

23:53.067 --> 23:55.102
Sure thing, Mr. Boykewich.
Congratulations.

23:55.136 --> 23:58.071
Yeah, congratulations.
It's so nice to
see you two so happy.

24:04.112 --> 24:06.280
I didn't get a chance
to tell you how
sincerely sorry

24:06.314 --> 24:08.282
I am for everything
that I said to you.

24:08.316 --> 24:13.053
Well, I did get
several chances
but I didn't apologize.

24:14.088 --> 24:16.023
Camille, I love you,

24:16.057 --> 24:19.193
and I think you and Dad
are going to be
very happy together.

24:19.227 --> 24:23.363
And I apologize
for every bad thing
that I said to you.

24:23.398 --> 24:26.033
Oh, Ben,
I know you didn't mean it.

24:26.067 --> 24:29.036
And I'm sorry
I punched you.

24:29.070 --> 24:29.102
(LAUGHS)

24:31.206 --> 24:33.006
But, you know,
if it led to this,
then...

24:33.041 --> 24:34.274
It was all meant to be.

24:34.309 --> 24:35.108
See you two tomorrow.

24:39.380 --> 24:40.981
You think he'll be upset
when he finds out?

24:41.015 --> 24:44.251
No. I don't.
He's always
wanted a sister.

24:44.285 --> 24:46.153
We still have to get cleared
through social services

24:46.187 --> 24:48.021
and that
could take months.

24:48.056 --> 24:48.088
We'll see.

24:53.094 --> 24:55.095
We should have
done this years ago.

24:55.129 --> 24:56.363
I'm sorry.
That's okay.

24:58.032 --> 25:00.133
Leo, I don't have any regrets,

25:00.168 --> 25:01.168
I just got everything
I've ever wanted in life.

25:11.145 --> 25:12.312
You are such a great
keyboard player.

25:12.347 --> 25:14.348
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

25:14.382 --> 25:15.148
Where'd you
learn to play?
Juvie.

25:16.317 --> 25:17.317
Oh!

25:21.322 --> 25:23.290
She doesn't want
to break up with you.

25:23.324 --> 25:26.193
You were right.
That stupid couple told her
to break up with you.

25:26.227 --> 25:28.128
I knew it.

25:28.162 --> 25:30.030
But, I'm not going back
with her if she's going
to listen to them.

25:30.064 --> 25:31.164
Really?
Yeah.

25:31.199 --> 25:32.232
Really.
I don't need this.

25:32.267 --> 25:34.167
I've had enough
rejection in my life.

25:34.202 --> 25:36.036
Okay. Well,
pick one.

25:37.205 --> 25:39.273
Mmm-hmm.

25:39.307 --> 25:42.009
We're interested.
Pick one of us.

25:42.043 --> 25:43.310
(SCOFFS) No.

25:43.344 --> 25:45.245
Why not?
Yeah, why not?

25:45.280 --> 25:47.080
I mean,
we're as cute
as you are.

25:47.115 --> 25:48.348
That has nothing to do
with anything,

25:48.383 --> 25:50.183
you're supposed to
be Kathy's friends.

25:50.218 --> 25:50.717
She dumped you.

25:50.752 --> 25:53.153
She didn't dump you.

25:53.187 --> 25:55.055
No. But she sent us
over here to tell you

25:55.089 --> 25:56.356
she wants
to get back together

25:56.391 --> 25:59.126
and we've done that,
and now we're hitting on you.

26:00.061 --> 26:01.094
For real. Pick one.

26:01.129 --> 26:04.331
No.
I've let a guy go
to third base before.

26:04.365 --> 26:07.000
Which doesn't
mean anything.

26:07.035 --> 26:09.303
Okay, we don't even know
what the bases are.

26:09.337 --> 26:12.306
But I'm sure somebody coming
from your background

26:12.340 --> 26:16.076
could show us,
or maybe one of us.

26:16.110 --> 26:18.045
I have to get out of here.
Do you mind?

26:21.215 --> 26:23.350
He's totally hot.
Yeah.

26:23.384 --> 26:25.252
How'd she get him?

26:25.286 --> 26:26.286
I don't know.

26:26.321 --> 26:28.055
I mean, she's pregnant.

26:28.089 --> 26:30.190
Maybe he's a freak
like Ben Boykewich.

26:30.224 --> 26:31.291
(CHUCKLES)

26:38.166 --> 26:39.066
I saw him.

26:40.268 --> 26:42.302
He didn't look good.

26:42.337 --> 26:44.304
Yeah, unfortunately,
he doesn't want
to go back with you.

26:46.174 --> 26:51.979
All right... Well,
probably for the best.

26:52.013 --> 26:54.114
Mmm. So, do you mind?

26:54.382 --> 26:56.049
Mind?

26:56.084 --> 26:57.451
We need boyfriends.

26:57.485 --> 27:00.320
So we're hoping, since
he's free, he would just
choose one of us.

27:01.289 --> 27:04.024
'Cause he's not
choosing you.

27:09.330 --> 27:11.231
(SNIFFLING)

27:13.762 --> 27:13.762
+

27:22.085 --> 27:22.284
Hello.

27:22.318 --> 27:23.185
Hi.

27:23.219 --> 27:26.888
Hello.

27:28.992 --> 27:30.859
Yeah. You know,
the directions over here
were totaWhat?ss.

27:30.893 --> 27:33.061
My mother gave you
directions?

27:33.096 --> 27:38.900
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
My mother has Alzheimer's.

27:38.935 --> 27:40.836
And she doesn't know
what she's talking
about half the time,

27:40.870 --> 27:44.973
and some idiot nurse
taught her how to email
and text and tweet,

27:45.008 --> 27:48.977
and thank you all
for coming but really,

27:49.012 --> 27:52.814
I'm not ready to date
and I'm sure
that when I am,

27:52.849 --> 27:54.016
I can find someone
all by myself.

27:54.050 --> 27:55.217
I'm sure you can.

27:55.251 --> 27:58.954
So thank you all for coming,
but really, you can go now.

28:01.124 --> 28:02.190
I'm okay, really.

28:02.225 --> 28:05.193
Would you like to stick
around for the AA meeting?

28:05.228 --> 28:08.897
What?

28:08.931 --> 28:11.166
Having an AA meeting,
didn't know you were coming.
(CHUCKLES)

28:11.200 --> 28:13.835
An AA meeting?
Yeah.

28:13.870 --> 28:16.038
They had something
at the church tonight so
George said it'd be okay.

28:18.007 --> 28:18.907
Oh!

28:19.142 --> 28:20.876
My mother...

28:21.944 --> 28:23.879
Oh, my God.
Never mind.

28:23.913 --> 28:26.815
And I'll be right back.

28:26.849 --> 28:28.116
My mother has been
sending out...

28:28.151 --> 28:30.152
I know,
I get all the messages.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.020
She has my email address
and my phone number

28:32.055 --> 28:35.057
and I'm following her
on Twitter.

28:35.091 --> 28:36.024
She's funny.
No, she's not.

28:36.059 --> 28:38.960
No, she is.
(FIRMLY) No. She is not.

28:38.995 --> 28:41.129
Okay, okay.

28:41.164 --> 28:44.800
Hey, guess who got
married today?

28:44.834 --> 28:46.835
George and Kathleen?
What?

28:46.869 --> 28:49.838
No. Leo and Camille.

28:49.872 --> 28:52.808
At their house with a judge
and I got to be a witness.

28:52.842 --> 28:54.810
Oh. Nice.
Good for them.

28:55.011 --> 28:57.045
Hi.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.880
You know, my mother
has Alzheimer's too.

28:58.915 --> 28:59.948
It's pretty tough,
isn't it?

28:59.982 --> 29:00.916
Yeah, it really is.

29:04.020 --> 29:08.123
I'll just be, um,
in there. Or somewhere.

29:08.157 --> 29:11.093
I'm Nora's sponsor.
Willowdine.

29:11.127 --> 29:13.095
Willowdine!
That's a beautiful name.

29:13.129 --> 29:15.163
I'm Anne.
And you have
an 18-year-old

29:15.198 --> 29:17.899
and a 17-year-old
and a two-year-old.

29:17.934 --> 29:18.934
Because Nora forwarded me
the emails.

29:20.103 --> 29:22.037
(LAUGHS)

29:22.071 --> 29:23.004
And I'm gay,
we're all gay,
it's a gay group.

29:23.039 --> 29:23.839
Oh.

29:28.077 --> 29:29.845
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

29:29.879 --> 29:33.014
I would have called
but I left my phone
at home.

29:33.049 --> 29:35.050
Hi.
Hi.

29:35.084 --> 29:35.917
Talk to you later. Mmm.
Oh, bye.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.121
Who's that?

29:39.155 --> 29:42.824
Oh, Nora's having
an AA meeting
in the living room.

29:42.859 --> 29:43.992
Your father told her
it was okay.
I didn't know,

29:44.026 --> 29:46.061
or I could have met you
at your apartment.

29:46.095 --> 29:48.964
Yeah, but we said here
and I couldn't call,

29:48.998 --> 29:51.833
because I left
my stupid phone
at home today.

29:51.868 --> 29:53.101
I just wanted to show you

29:53.136 --> 29:54.936
what I thought might
make a nice backyard wedding

29:54.971 --> 29:56.071
and then if you like it,
I'll show Nora and Margaret.

29:56.105 --> 29:57.906
Could we do this
some other time,

29:57.940 --> 29:59.908
or do we have to
even do it at all?

29:59.942 --> 30:02.944
I'm sure that whatever
you put together is fine.
Really.

30:02.979 --> 30:05.213
I just really
want to get home,

30:05.248 --> 30:07.883
I didn't tell Ricky
I was stopping by here.

30:07.917 --> 30:10.051
Well, why don't you
just call him from
the phone here?

30:10.086 --> 30:11.153
Donovan and I
have been working
on this all day.

30:11.187 --> 30:15.223
Mom, I'm sorry,
I just really
want to go home.

30:15.258 --> 30:18.260
Is everything okay?
Yeah. As far as I know.

30:20.229 --> 30:23.165
I got accepted into
Hudson University in New York.

30:23.199 --> 30:25.033
The counselor told me today.

30:25.067 --> 30:28.003
I forgot I even applied.
I applied last spring.

30:28.037 --> 30:30.972
So I want to get home
in case the acceptance
letter came in today

30:31.007 --> 30:32.908
so I can tear it up
because I don't want
Ricky to think

30:32.942 --> 30:34.142
that I don't want
to get married

30:34.177 --> 30:37.012
so that I can go to school
in New York instead.

30:37.046 --> 30:38.813
Remarried.
Yeah.

30:38.848 --> 30:41.883
Let me ask you something
and answer honestly, okay?

30:41.918 --> 30:44.152
Would you rather be single
and living in New York

30:44.187 --> 30:46.021
with John
and going to college

30:46.055 --> 30:47.923
or living with Ricky
and John here?

30:47.957 --> 30:49.991
Uh... Honestly,
(CHUCKLES)

30:50.026 --> 30:53.828
I'd like it if John and Ricky
and I could live in New York

30:53.863 --> 30:55.864
and I could go
to school in New York.

30:55.898 --> 30:56.965
But I can't.

30:56.999 --> 30:59.034
And that's just how it is.

30:59.068 --> 31:00.902
Well, maybe you can
have everything
that you want, Amy.

31:00.937 --> 31:04.072
Talk to Ricky.
Don't just throw away
the acceptance letter,

31:04.106 --> 31:05.140
talk to him.

31:05.174 --> 31:07.142
And talk to him about
the wedding, too. Okay?

31:07.176 --> 31:09.144
Here. Take these
with you, and call me.

31:09.178 --> 31:12.948
Don't email,
don't text. Call.

31:12.982 --> 31:14.182
Okay. Goodnight.
Thank you.

31:15.251 --> 31:16.918
Come on, bud.

31:21.257 --> 31:23.925
I used to fantasize
about marrying you.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.160
All the girls
in the house did.

31:25.194 --> 31:26.962
Oh, they did not.
Oh, they did too.

31:26.996 --> 31:30.098
You remember,
I stole a lock of your hair
while you were sleeping?

31:30.132 --> 31:32.867
(CHUCKLES)
That was to put
some spell on me.

31:32.902 --> 31:34.803
Mmm-hmm.
A love spell!

31:34.837 --> 31:35.937
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

31:37.940 --> 31:39.040
Whose call
are you ignoring?

31:40.042 --> 31:41.042
I have to go.

31:41.077 --> 31:42.911
You said that hours ago.

31:42.945 --> 31:45.146
Well, Amy finally decided
to return my calls, so...

31:45.181 --> 31:48.116
I have to go.
Goodnight.
Thanks.

31:48.150 --> 31:50.852
I just needed to be
out of the house
for a while.

31:50.886 --> 31:52.854
I was feeling myself
getting a little too angry.

31:54.056 --> 31:54.956
Anytime.

31:57.193 --> 31:59.828
Even though I get annoyed
with Amy sometimes,

31:59.862 --> 32:02.864
I don't regret having John
and getting married.

32:02.898 --> 32:02.964
Okay.

32:04.834 --> 32:05.634
Okay.

32:05.668 --> 32:06.768
You got someone
to walk you home?

32:06.802 --> 32:10.071
Yeah. I'll be calling Bubba
till they find that guy.

32:10.106 --> 32:11.039
All right.
Goodnight.

32:11.073 --> 32:13.430
Goodnight.

+

32:22.911 --> 32:23.608
Hey, guess what!

32:22.262 --> 32:24.129
got a message from
Leo on the way home,

32:24.164 --> 32:26.298
he and Camille
got married today.

32:26.333 --> 32:30.202
Well, congratulations to them.
Where have you been?

32:30.236 --> 32:32.204
Where have I been?
Where have you been
all day?

32:32.238 --> 32:34.239
You haven't answered
any of my phone calls
or messages.

32:34.274 --> 32:36.075
I left my phone
at home, okay?

32:36.109 --> 32:37.276
Never occurred to me.

32:37.310 --> 32:40.112
I was where I usually am.
At school. At work.

32:40.146 --> 32:41.246
Then I had to drop by
my dad's house

32:41.281 --> 32:44.316
to pick up stupid
wedding stuff
from my mother.

32:44.351 --> 32:46.986
Where have you been?
You didn't say.

32:47.020 --> 32:47.920
I know I didn't say.

32:47.954 --> 32:49.989
I've been where
I always am. At school.

32:52.025 --> 32:54.059
(SIGHS) Your last class
was at 3:00.

32:54.094 --> 32:57.029
You always have
dinner ready.

32:57.063 --> 32:58.163
I got home late
and I had to feed John

32:58.198 --> 32:59.999
a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

33:00.033 --> 33:02.134
So what?
He can eat that one night.

33:02.168 --> 33:04.336
Have you eaten?
Who'd you have dinner with?

33:04.371 --> 33:06.271
I haven't eaten.

33:06.306 --> 33:07.172
I left you a message
and said I'd pick up
something if you wanted.

33:07.207 --> 33:10.075
But maybe
you didn't get that

33:10.110 --> 33:12.277
because you were
listening to the 47
other messages I left you.

33:17.384 --> 33:19.151
Did you open my mail?

33:19.185 --> 33:20.052
You know what? I did.

33:20.086 --> 33:22.154
That's a federal offense!

33:22.188 --> 33:23.222
Have me arrested.

33:23.256 --> 33:25.157
Ricky, you cannot
open my mail.

33:25.191 --> 33:27.993
I did. And you got into
Hudson University
in New York...

33:28.028 --> 33:30.963
So, when are you leaving?

33:30.997 --> 33:35.300
I applied last Spring,
before you even asked me
to marry you at graduation.

33:35.335 --> 33:39.238
It was just something
I always thought
I would do, so I did.

33:40.273 --> 33:42.074
Look, I know that
I can't go to

33:42.108 --> 33:44.143
Hudson University
in New York.

33:44.177 --> 33:45.244
But you want to?

33:45.278 --> 33:46.311
No, I do not.

33:46.346 --> 33:48.080
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

33:49.049 --> 33:50.115
Where were you?

33:50.150 --> 33:51.116
I was at the library.

33:52.285 --> 33:53.986
What?

33:54.020 --> 33:55.988
Please, please
do not lie to me.

33:56.022 --> 33:58.090
I'm not lying to you.
Are you lying to me?

33:58.124 --> 33:59.291
You really don't want
to go to school in New York

33:59.325 --> 34:01.126
like I know you always
dreamed about?

34:03.029 --> 34:05.297
Dreams change.

34:05.331 --> 34:09.134
I just want to be
married to you,
I want us to be happy.

34:09.168 --> 34:12.304
I hope so, Amy,
I hope so.

34:12.338 --> 34:14.072
Please don't break my heart.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

34:21.848 --> 34:24.216
Mmm. Mmm.
Do not pick that up.

34:24.250 --> 34:26.051
Okay.

34:26.085 --> 34:28.020
Okay, pick it up,

34:28.054 --> 34:30.022
I can tell
you won't be able to
fully concentrate on me

34:30.056 --> 34:31.190
until you see who that is.

34:31.224 --> 34:33.158
It's Ben.
Okay.

34:33.193 --> 34:35.094
Oh, my God!

34:35.128 --> 34:36.962
His dad got married
this afternoon.

34:36.996 --> 34:38.063
And what does that mean?

34:38.098 --> 34:41.166
It means that Leo is happy,
so Ben is happy.

34:41.201 --> 34:42.333
So, I'm happy.

34:45.138 --> 34:46.038
They're really nice,
Leo and Ben.

34:47.273 --> 34:49.241
Yeah.

34:49.275 --> 34:51.076
Oh, right. I forgot.

34:51.110 --> 34:52.978
M y ex-husband
called you a pervert.

34:53.012 --> 34:54.045
Oh, you forgot, huh?

34:54.080 --> 34:54.112
Yes.

34:56.282 --> 34:59.985
So, when are you
moving in here?

35:00.019 --> 35:01.253
Well, I've been
thinking about that,

35:01.287 --> 35:04.056
and my lease isn't up
for a couple of months,

35:04.090 --> 35:07.192
so I'll just keep
my apartment for now,

35:07.227 --> 35:09.995
but I'll stay over here
any time you'll let me.

35:10.029 --> 35:12.097
That's not what
we talked about.

35:12.132 --> 35:13.098
You're staying here?

35:15.101 --> 35:16.301
Staying?

35:16.336 --> 35:18.036
What kind of
low-class move is that?

35:18.071 --> 35:19.338
We talked about
your "living" here,
not staying here.

35:19.372 --> 35:22.141
Let's just see how it goes.
I can move a few things over.

35:22.175 --> 35:25.210
Oh, okay. So, keeping
your bachelor pad,
that's your B plan?

35:25.245 --> 35:26.378
In case things
don't work out.

35:26.412 --> 35:29.181
(LAUGHS)
What bachelor pad?
I live with my brother.

35:29.215 --> 35:30.983
Your brother's never around.

35:31.017 --> 35:33.018
I just want to make sure
you really want me
to move in here.

35:33.052 --> 35:34.119
All right?
This is a big step for us.

35:34.154 --> 35:36.054
Well, not for you,
if you're not
real moving in.

35:36.089 --> 35:38.957
I'm moving in, I am.

35:38.992 --> 35:43.228
I'd just be
more comfortable
If we had a commitment.

35:43.263 --> 35:47.065
I believe I asked you
to marry me some time ago
and you weren't ready.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.267
How are you feeling
about that now?

35:48.301 --> 35:50.269
You didn't say anything
about that last week.

35:50.303 --> 35:52.070
Is last week
the only week
that counts?

We've been together
five months.

35:53.940 --> 35:57.176
No, we haven't.
Uh, yes we have.
We met May 24th.

35:58.178 --> 35:59.912
You know when we met?

35:59.946 --> 35:59.978
Yes, I do.

36:00.947 --> 36:04.216
Wow, that went by fast.

than I was married to Ben.

want to get married to me

before I officially
give up my apartment
and move in here.

that's too much to ask.

No, but maybe I should.

36:46.192 --> 36:47.192
Just tell her
at school tomorrow.

36:47.227 --> 36:50.095
Why? Because
I might bother
her and Ricky at home?

36:50.129 --> 36:52.064
No. This is important,
isn't it Henry?

36:52.098 --> 36:54.266
Yeah, it's important.
Call her.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.235
Yeah. You know,
maybe I will.

36:56.269 --> 36:56.969
Okay, I'm going home.

36:57.003 --> 36:59.004
You don't have a car.

37:00.139 --> 37:01.940
I could drive you home,
of course.

37:01.975 --> 37:03.075
All right.

37:03.109 --> 37:03.675
Just as a friend.

37:03.710 --> 37:05.244
Yeah. We're all friends.

37:05.278 --> 37:07.212
Night, Ben.

37:13.019 --> 37:14.052
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

37:19.325 --> 37:21.126
Ben.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.061
Ugh. Hit ignore.

37:26.966 --> 37:28.166
Hi, Ben.

37:28.201 --> 37:30.936
Hi, Amy. I just called
to give you the good news.

37:30.970 --> 37:32.871
My dad got married today.

37:32.906 --> 37:35.207
Yeah, I know.
He told Ricky
and Ricky told me.

37:35.241 --> 37:37.209
Oh. Well...

37:37.243 --> 37:40.178
Uh, I wanted to tell you...
So, there you go.

37:40.213 --> 37:42.114
Oh, I actually have
other good news.

37:43.182 --> 37:45.050
What's that?

37:45.084 --> 37:48.020
I got an early acceptance
into Hudson University
in New York.

37:51.057 --> 37:52.224
Ricky, I had no idea.

37:55.028 --> 37:56.194
(SIGHS)

37:56.229 --> 37:57.996
Why did I apply
to that stupid school?

38:01.234 --> 38:02.167
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

38:05.104 --> 38:05.637
<i>ETHAN: Hey.</i>

38:05.672 --> 38:09.041
Hey. What do you want?

38:09.075 --> 38:11.076
I want another meeting
with the parents.

38:11.110 --> 38:13.178
You're not even
my boyfriend anymore.

38:13.212 --> 38:14.246
Well, apparently,
they're the ones
who decide that, not us,

38:14.280 --> 38:16.181
so I'd like
another shot with them.

38:16.215 --> 38:17.983
Oh, stop it.

38:18.017 --> 38:21.019
I mean, you acted like a jerk,

38:21.054 --> 38:22.955
and then they talked to me
about just waiting

38:22.989 --> 38:25.190
until the baby is born
to be in a relationship,

38:25.224 --> 38:27.960
which, I'm sorry,
sounded like
a reasonable request.

38:29.195 --> 38:31.997
Right now,
I have to focus on
myself and on the baby.

38:32.031 --> 38:33.098
Well, do you want me
back or not?

38:33.132 --> 38:37.135
I do, but...
I mean, what's the point

38:37.170 --> 38:39.171
if you're going to meet
with them again?

38:39.205 --> 38:42.140
I'll just get another lecture,
feel guilty, and then
break up with you again.

38:42.175 --> 38:43.141
Guilty about what?

38:43.176 --> 38:45.911
About doing anything
that would potentially

38:45.945 --> 38:48.113
upset these people.

38:48.147 --> 38:51.984
Because I want them
to be the parents.
They're great.

38:52.018 --> 38:54.086
And they really haven't
required a lot from me, so...

38:54.120 --> 38:56.188
Haven't required
a lot from you?

38:56.222 --> 38:57.055
Just wait until the baby
breaks out of you

38:57.090 --> 38:58.156
and leaves your
insides destroyed.

38:58.191 --> 39:01.026
<i>You think that's not
asking a lot of you?</i>

39:01.060 --> 39:03.962
<i>To go through childbirth
and then hand over
the baby to them?</i>

39:03.997 --> 39:05.230
That doesn't happen,
you idiot.

39:07.934 --> 39:08.967
And I hate you.

39:09.002 --> 39:12.037
(SIGHS)

39:12.071 --> 39:13.972
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

39:14.007 --> 39:16.074
That was a terrible
thing to say.

39:16.109 --> 39:17.275
Let's just leave it
at "we're broken up."

39:19.245 --> 39:21.213
(SIGHS)

39:23.216 --> 39:25.283
Why did I say that? Why?

39:26.953 --> 39:28.954
Here. Thanks.

39:28.988 --> 39:31.089
You didn't eat anything.

39:31.124 --> 39:32.991
I don't really
feel like eating.

39:33.026 --> 39:34.993
My famous quarterback
boyfriend just announced
to the world

39:35.028 --> 39:36.161
that I'm a teenage harlot.

39:36.195 --> 39:39.264
Well, Grace,
it is a good lesson.

39:39.298 --> 39:41.299
Don't do things
you might regret later.

39:41.334 --> 39:43.101
Why don't you just say,
"I told you so,
I told you so"?

39:43.136 --> 39:46.104
Did you call Jack,
like I told you to?

39:46.139 --> 39:47.973
No. Did he call you?

39:48.007 --> 39:49.941
Did he ask you
to tell me to call him?

39:49.976 --> 39:51.276
He's left me plenty
of messages on my phone

39:51.310 --> 39:53.011
and I am not
speaking to him.

39:53.046 --> 39:54.046
Not today, anyway.

39:55.348 --> 39:59.017
When are you going home?

39:59.052 --> 40:00.118
There's a big lesbian
AA meeting
over at my house,

40:00.153 --> 40:01.953
I can't go home,
not right now,
but I'm going.

40:01.988 --> 40:04.156
Good.
KATHLEEN: Grace.

40:04.190 --> 40:05.957
Enough with the bad mood,
get over it.

40:05.992 --> 40:08.293
Get over it?
They're playing that clip
on every newscast,

40:08.327 --> 40:11.229
every sportscast,
every cast there is.

40:11.264 --> 40:13.165
I might as well
wear a scarlet letter
to school tomorrow.

40:13.199 --> 40:14.299
So the kids who
don't watch TV,

40:14.333 --> 40:16.101
but read the classics
will know as well?

40:16.135 --> 40:17.135
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

40:17.170 --> 40:18.203
Funny.

40:18.237 --> 40:19.271
There's nothing
funny about it!

40:19.305 --> 40:21.039
My entire reputation
is completely shot.

40:21.074 --> 40:23.975
No one's going to
take me seriously,

40:24.010 --> 40:25.077
no one's going
to take my commitment
to Christianity seriously.

40:25.111 --> 40:27.179
I ould have just
stayed with Daniel.

40:28.347 --> 40:30.248
Who's Daniel?
Guy number three.

40:30.283 --> 40:34.086
Just out of curiosity,
why not guy number two?
Why not Grant?

40:34.120 --> 40:36.188
Because he thinks
he's smarter than I am.

40:36.222 --> 40:37.956
And he's not.
About anything.

40:38.991 --> 40:41.193
Wow.
Wow.

40:41.227 --> 40:44.229
So, uh, which guy am I?

40:44.263 --> 40:47.132
You're one and four.

40:47.166 --> 40:49.000
Oh, right.
I'll take it.t,

40:49.035 --> 40:51.903
(LAUGHS)

40:51.938 --> 40:53.171
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

40:53.206 --> 40:53.238
Yeah?

41:02.048 --> 41:04.015
Start praying, Christian.
