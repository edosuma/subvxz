<i>Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.288 --> 00:06.090
All I know is I kissed a
girl and now I'm gay.

00:06.124 --> 00:09.994
Look. Don't you think you've joined enough
clubs at school without joining this one?

00:10.028 --> 00:11.162
Mom, you're not gay.

00:11.196 --> 00:12.129
Yes, I am gay.

00:16.001 --> 00:17.034
Could you kiss me again?

00:17.269 --> 00:19.203
Wow.

00:20.272 --> 00:21.939
Goodbye, Omar.

00:24.176 --> 00:26.177
George, I'm gay.

00:26.211 --> 00:30.081
We're still going to love you, you're
still Amy and Ashley and Robie's mom,

00:30.115 --> 00:32.016
and you're still my Anne.

00:33.118 --> 00:34.285
I think I love you.

00:34.319 --> 00:36.087
I love you, too.

00:36.121 --> 00:37.989
Did they say what
caused the fire?

00:38.023 --> 00:39.257
Started in one of
the science labs.

00:40.993 --> 00:41.993
Alice...

00:43.095 --> 00:44.962
Thank you for coming over here,

00:44.997 --> 00:49.033
it may be the last chance I ever
have to have sex with a woman.

00:53.005 --> 00:57.008
Let's just do what you wanted to do,
and just run off and get married.

00:57.042 --> 00:58.175
Really? You want to do that?

00:58.210 --> 00:59.877
Yeah. I want to do that.

(SIGHS)

03:52.851 --> 03:54.985
Hello. Finally, someone
answered the phone.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.187
What is going on there?

03:56.221 --> 03:57.888
Nothing. Who didn't
answer their phone?

03:57.923 --> 04:00.758
You. Amy. Ashley.
My entire family.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.726
We text, we don't
answer the phones.

04:02.761 --> 04:03.828
We only did that when
you were away.

04:03.862 --> 04:05.029
Now that you're home,
it's back to the usual.

04:05.063 --> 04:06.730
You want someone,
you have to text.

04:06.765 --> 04:07.164
I don't want to text,
I want a voice.

04:07.199 --> 04:09.834
Human contact.

04:09.868 --> 04:11.001
I don't want words on a screen.

04:11.036 --> 04:12.736
I'm the mother.
I'm still the mother.

04:12.771 --> 04:14.772
Still? What do you mean?

04:14.806 --> 04:16.774
I mean, my whole life
just changed.

04:16.808 --> 04:18.007
What happened?
What happened?

04:18.043 --> 04:22.012
I told everyone that I'm gay
and then I come home and then nothing.

04:22.047 --> 04:24.048
No one calls me,
no one's answering my calls.

04:24.082 --> 04:26.784
Oh. That's all?
Nobody really cares.

04:26.818 --> 04:29.820
It doesn't really matter
that you're gay. So what?

04:29.855 --> 04:32.056
So what?
This is huge for me.

04:32.090 --> 04:35.202
And Amy kind of
came around in the end, but

04:35.322 --> 04:38.040
I don't know, I have the feeling
that Amy is not happy with me.

04:38.490 --> 04:39.930
Maybe not because I'm gay.

04:39.965 --> 04:41.799
Maybe it's because of
the way that I told her,

04:41.833 --> 04:43.448
or that I told Ashley first,
I don't know.

04:43.568 --> 04:45.035
It's just a gut feeling.

04:45.070 --> 04:46.561
You're making too big a deal
out of this.

04:46.681 --> 04:47.911
Am I?
Yeah.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.809
All right, well, anything else,

04:51.843 --> 04:53.010
other than for us to
answer our phones?

04:53.044 --> 04:55.503
George, I just feel
kinda vulnerable right now.

04:56.114 --> 04:58.846
And I want to stay
with my family.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.103
You were so supportive
of my coming out.

05:01.223 --> 05:03.456
I just really need
with all of you.

05:03.576 --> 05:05.850
All right, well, we'll try to do a
better job of staying in touch.

05:05.970 --> 05:07.725
(CLEARS THROAT)
Everything else okay?

05:07.759 --> 05:09.760
Yeah.
Pretty much, I guess.

05:09.794 --> 05:13.864
Mimsy is doing okay,
and Robie is good.

05:13.899 --> 05:18.035
I don't know,
I'm just feeling lonely.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.838
I was thinking of asking
Amy and John and Ashley

05:20.872 --> 05:22.940
if they wanted to come down here
tomorrow and spend the night.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.634
Hang out, talk.

05:24.754 --> 05:25.843
Amy went somewhere with Ricky,

05:25.877 --> 05:27.745
they're coming back
tomorrow, I'm babysitting.

05:27.779 --> 05:29.127
Why don't you try
texting Ashley?

05:29.247 --> 05:30.848
<i>Ashley doesn't have</i>
<i>her driver's license,</i>

05:30.882 --> 05:32.589
so if she wanted to come here,

05:32.709 --> 05:35.052
I guess I'd have to
go and get her.

05:35.086 --> 05:37.322
Unless you wanted to bring her?

05:38.565 --> 05:40.024
You'd bring her if
she wanted to come?

05:40.058 --> 05:41.859
Yeah. All right.

05:41.893 --> 05:43.961
Can you talk to her?
Talk her into coming here?

05:43.995 --> 05:45.062
Yeah, okay,
I'll give it a shot.

05:45.096 --> 05:48.699
I realty miss her.
And Amy.

05:48.733 --> 05:50.768
It's really important that I
spend time with them right now.

05:50.802 --> 05:51.569
All right.

05:51.603 --> 05:53.971
So where did you say
that Amy is?

05:54.005 --> 05:54.939
It's the last day of school, she
and Ricky took off somewhere.

05:54.973 --> 05:56.874
Where?
I don't know.

05:56.908 --> 05:58.075
It was a last minute thing.

05:58.109 --> 05:59.043
They just wanted to take a
drive, take a night off.

05:59.077 --> 06:00.711
Well, so what if something
happens to John?

06:00.745 --> 06:02.746
How will you get
in touch with them?

06:02.781 --> 06:03.814
I'd text them.

06:03.848 --> 06:05.049
Bye.
Bye.

06:11.022 --> 06:13.958
What do you mean,
that's my diploma?

06:13.992 --> 06:17.661
You're just going to
Just like that?

06:17.696 --> 06:18.529
Well, school is out,

06:18.563 --> 06:21.799
and you've already
required subjects

06:21.833 --> 06:23.834
and you've already gone
to a graduation ceremony,

06:23.868 --> 06:26.003
so, yeah, that's your diploma.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.705
Take it.
No.

06:27.739 --> 06:29.673
What do you mean, "No?"
I don't want it.

06:29.708 --> 06:32.943
Well, not like this,
a napkin or something.

06:32.978 --> 06:34.745
I want special.

06:34.779 --> 06:37.881
I could roll it up
and tie a bow around it.

06:37.916 --> 06:38.749
No, it's not that, it's just...

06:40.885 --> 06:41.919
This isn't right.

06:41.953 --> 06:44.822
This is not how
it's supposed to end.

06:44.856 --> 06:47.958
It's the culmination of
12 years of education,

06:47.993 --> 06:50.761
thirteen if you count kindergarten
and I count kindergarten.

06:50.795 --> 06:52.763
I don't know what
you want me to do.

06:52.797 --> 06:54.765
We don't have
a graduation ceremony

06:54.799 --> 06:56.800
for the summer school
graduating class.

06:56.835 --> 06:57.801
At least not this year anyway,

06:57.836 --> 06:59.737
because there's only
three of you.

06:59.771 --> 07:03.674
So we're graduating
in summer school!

07:03.708 --> 07:05.576
What, if you prick us,
do we not bleed?

07:05.610 --> 07:07.911
What?
Shakespeare.

07:07.946 --> 07:10.614
<i>Merchant of Venice. And I want
some recognition for graduating.</i>

07:10.649 --> 07:11.949
There's no graduation ceremony.

07:13.785 --> 07:14.885
How could you not know this?

07:14.919 --> 07:16.720
I thought today
you were gonna tell me

07:16.755 --> 07:18.889
that it was next week
or something,

07:18.923 --> 07:20.924
I thought you had to see
if I finished my classes.

07:20.959 --> 07:24.695
Do you know what hell I went
through to graduate high school?

07:24.729 --> 07:26.630
Yes. I know you've
been through a lot,

07:26.665 --> 07:28.732
which is why I pushed to
have you included

07:28.767 --> 07:32.603
in the other graduation
ceremony with your friends.

07:32.637 --> 07:34.605
I'm leaving for vacation

07:34.639 --> 07:36.807
and I want to get out of
town before it gets dark.

07:36.841 --> 07:40.944
I'm driving to San Clemente, and I'm
going to the beach for two weeks.

07:40.979 --> 07:42.713
I paid for it with my credit card
points and I can't get those back.

07:42.747 --> 07:44.882
So I am going to get packed
up and get out of here.

07:44.916 --> 07:46.984
What kind of
a counselor are you?

07:47.018 --> 07:49.687
Oh. I know what's going on.

07:50.889 --> 07:52.790
You don't want to leave school.

07:52.824 --> 07:54.725
Aw.
I want to leave.

07:54.759 --> 07:56.894
I am definitely ready
to get out of high school.

07:56.928 --> 07:59.596
I just don't want to
leave like this.

07:59.631 --> 08:00.798
Why wouldn't I want to
leave high school?

08:00.832 --> 08:02.800
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
because your boyfriend

08:02.834 --> 08:04.668
is going to be
student teaching here?

08:05.770 --> 08:07.771
Omar?
Say what?

08:07.806 --> 08:08.672
You are done here, Adrian,

08:10.675 --> 08:13.677
Omar or no Omar.

08:13.712 --> 08:15.713
Actually it's "finished." It's
not "done," it's "finished."

08:17.882 --> 08:18.916
You're a high school graduate.

08:19.884 --> 08:22.820
Fine.

08:22.854 --> 08:25.589
There's nothing
special about it,

08:25.623 --> 08:26.790
it's just another day.

08:28.860 --> 08:32.663
Goodbye, see ya.
Thanks for nothing.

08:32.964 --> 08:34.965
Congratulations!

08:38.703 --> 08:46.703

09:25.784 --> 09:26.950
Whatever.

09:26.985 --> 09:28.652
Bye, high school.

09:41.389 --> 09:43.290
CLERK: Just
sign here, please.

09:44.049 --> 09:45.261
Sign it Mr. and Mrs.

09:45.381 --> 09:46.936
I don't think
we have to do that.

09:47.056 --> 09:49.199
This is just a credit issue,
not a morals issue.

09:49.319 --> 09:51.131
They don't care
if we're married.

09:51.926 --> 09:54.339
We're on our honeymoon.
Kind of. We eloped.

09:54.456 --> 09:58.176
Which is why I don't have a wedding band.
Just an engagement ring.

09:58.296 --> 10:00.294
He proposed to me
at graduation.

10:00.329 --> 10:01.562
You really don't
have to explain.

10:01.597 --> 10:03.873
Oh. That's nice. Why
didn't you say something?

10:03.993 --> 10:06.267
We have a honeymoon suite.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.397
Oh, well, we're kind
of on a budget.

10:07.517 --> 10:08.447
The whole world's on a budget,

10:08.567 --> 10:10.335
that's why we have
so many rooms available.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.911
You know, I'm going to
give you an upgrade.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.912
For the price of the room you can
have the suite. Our compliments.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.716
That's so nice of you.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.651
Isn't it... Dear?

10:19.686 --> 10:21.653
Yes, dear, it is.

10:21.688 --> 10:22.654
So what did you
get your degree in?

10:22.689 --> 10:23.522
Child psychology.
Oh.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.791
Well, that's interesting.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.693
I suppose you're going
for your master's now.

10:27.727 --> 10:28.761
I suppose.

10:31.956 --> 10:33.866
Oh, my God,
isn't this is great?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.033
If you call lying great.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.068
It's not lying exactly.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.803
I don't have a degree.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.004
Yeah, but you will someday.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.912
My mother is texting me now.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.046
She wants to know where we are.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.815
Are you going to tell her?

10:49.849 --> 10:51.784
No, I don't want to
deal with her today.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.720
Today is just for us.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.855
I don't feel like talking
about her and her new life.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.891
All right, but she'll probably
keep calling or texting.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.893
Yeah, well, my dad will text me

11:00.927 --> 11:02.027
if there's a problem with John,

11:02.061 --> 11:05.030
and that's the only person
I'll respond to, is John,

11:05.064 --> 11:06.999
or my dad calling about John.
Which he won't.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.939
You could just let her
know where we are.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.742
Your dad probably told her he's
babysitting and she just wants to know.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.778
That was almost
her text exactly.

11:19.813 --> 11:23.916
But really, I'm not calling
or texting anyone.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.084
It's our day. And it's
going to be our night.

11:30.790 --> 11:31.056
Did you know that there was
no graduation ceremony?

11:31.090 --> 11:33.992
Nothing.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.028
I got handed a piece of paper in the
counselor's office and that was it.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.797
Done, over.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.799
You didn't really think there was
gonna be a graduation, did you?

11:40.834 --> 11:43.068
I mean, you went with everybody
else when they graduated.

11:43.102 --> 11:43.902
I would've thought that
would've turned you off

11:43.937 --> 11:45.971
wanting too to
another graduation.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.774
Why's that?
Uh, Ricky proposed to Amy.

11:48.808 --> 11:49.208
Ugh! I don't care.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.910
Okay, well...

11:51.945 --> 11:54.046
My mom and Tom and Jacob
are waiting for me.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.948
So I should really go.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.684
You say that like you're
never going to see me again.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.885
You're going to see me again.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.987
I mean, we're still
friends, aren't we?

12:02.021 --> 12:03.755
Just because we're
no longer roommates

12:03.790 --> 12:04.823
and we're not going
to the same school

12:04.858 --> 12:06.658
doesn't mean
we're aren't friends.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.860
I'm happy you brought that up.

12:07.894 --> 12:08.927
Brought what up?
Our friendship.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.797
Because you know,
if you think about it,

12:11.831 --> 12:13.966
you and I are really
going our separate ways.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.969
You're going off to college
and I'm still in high school.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.037
You're a whole year
older than me.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.672
Ten months.

12:20.707 --> 12:21.807
You're going to have
new friends

12:21.841 --> 12:22.875
and view life
experiences, and...

12:22.909 --> 12:25.878
Jack's going off
to college, too.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.912
Are you giving him
this same speech?

12:28.014 --> 12:30.649
No, you're not.

12:30.683 --> 12:31.483
Because you're trying to
end our friendship

12:31.517 --> 12:32.784
because of that kiss,
aren't you?

12:34.053 --> 12:35.888
You're not just here
to say goodbye,

12:35.922 --> 12:37.923
you're here to say you don't
want to be friends with me.

12:37.957 --> 12:41.693
I just feel like it's the best thing.
For both of us.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.695
Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.931
Fine. Go pack up the rest
of your things and go home.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.833
I packed.
Everything is in the car.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.703
Goodbye, Adrian.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.771
Good luck to you at school.

12:54.974 --> 12:57.396
Yeah, and good luck to you
getting another best friend.

12:59.012 --> 12:59.978
(SCOFFS)

13:09.192 --> 13:11.994
Hey.
Oh. Hey.

13:12.028 --> 13:13.095
I just thought I'd drop by.

13:13.129 --> 13:14.263
Why's that?
Why just drop?

13:14.297 --> 13:18.434
Why not text or call or
throw a rock at the window?

13:18.468 --> 13:20.092
You can't just drop by, Henry.

13:20.212 --> 13:22.438
Oh. I thought I could.

13:22.472 --> 13:24.364
I've kind of been dropping
by since the third grade.

13:24.484 --> 13:27.031
Well, we're not in
the third grade anymore.

13:27.151 --> 13:30.345
Okay, but it's
the last day of school,

13:30.380 --> 13:32.048
and we always do
something together.

13:32.168 --> 13:33.582
I tried to catch up with
you after the last class,

13:33.616 --> 13:36.313
but it looked like you and
Alice were in some kind of,

13:36.433 --> 13:38.876
I don't know,
private conversation.

13:40.156 --> 13:41.633
Ben, can I ask you something?

13:41.753 --> 13:43.258
What is this, some
kind of interrogation?

13:43.293 --> 13:46.228
I just get the feeling that you and
Alice aren't telling me something.

13:46.262 --> 13:47.396
What wouldn't we be
telling you?

13:47.430 --> 13:49.264
Something you don't
want me to know?

13:49.384 --> 13:51.200
That was
an intense conversation.

13:52.052 --> 13:53.777
What is going on?
Just tell me.

13:53.897 --> 13:56.990
Okay, look. Truth?

13:57.890 --> 14:01.110
I'm having a harder time being
around you than I thought I would.

14:02.312 --> 14:04.246
I mean...

14:04.280 --> 14:06.248
I want things to just be
the way they were, but...

14:06.742 --> 14:07.875
You slept with Adrian.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.711
Are we back to that?
Back to that?

14:09.745 --> 14:10.912
Did we ever really
get away from that?

14:10.946 --> 14:12.647
Uh, I thought we had.

14:12.681 --> 14:16.017
Yeah.
Well, I'm trying, okay?

14:16.051 --> 14:18.653
I'm really trying, but...

14:18.687 --> 14:20.687
I mean, that was a terrible
thing to do, Henry.

14:20.923 --> 14:22.724
And I know you're sorry,

14:22.758 --> 14:25.927
but sometimes it's just hard
to look you in the face.

14:25.961 --> 14:27.829
Shouldn't it be hard for me
to look you in the face?

14:27.863 --> 14:30.698
It should be,
but I guess it isn't.

14:30.733 --> 14:31.866
But, Ben, I thought
you forgave me.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.969
I forgave you but I
didn't forget about it.

14:35.003 --> 14:36.971
I wish I could, but sometimes

14:37.005 --> 14:39.907
it just gets to me.

14:39.942 --> 14:41.976
Like today,
on the last day of school,

14:42.010 --> 14:43.978
when traditionally the three
of us would get together.

14:44.012 --> 14:45.913
The last last day of school,
you slept with Adrian.

14:45.948 --> 14:48.883
And I got to tell you,
Henry, you lost some trust.

14:50.853 --> 14:52.887
And over time,
I'm sure I'll trust you again,

14:52.921 --> 14:54.922
but I'm not there yet,
all right?

14:55.758 --> 14:57.024

14:57.059 --> 14:59.627
And sometimes I just need to
talk to Alice all by myself.

14:59.661 --> 15:01.596
All right.
I understand.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.831
Alice is great to talk to.

15:05.734 --> 15:07.969
And I just really appreciate

15:08.003 --> 15:10.805
that you're willing to take the
time to try and trust me again.

15:10.839 --> 15:15.009
I'm here for you,
if you need me.

15:15.043 --> 15:18.846

again, I'm sorry.

Yeah. Haven't been

15:39.802 --> 15:42.570
It's Friday night,
school is out,

15:42.604 --> 15:43.704
so come over here and get me.

15:43.739 --> 15:44.972
The last time we went out,
something bad happened.

15:45.007 --> 15:48.910
Ben, you worry too much.

15:48.944 --> 15:50.745
Come on.
I haven't seen you all week.

15:50.779 --> 15:51.913
Your dad still
hasn't said anything?

15:51.947 --> 15:54.882
No. He hasn't said a word,
neither of them have.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.751
You know he knows
we were there.

15:56.785 --> 15:58.586
I'm sure he does.

15:58.620 --> 16:01.622
And I'm sure he's seen
all the footage

16:01.657 --> 16:02.957
from all the cameras,
from every angle,

16:02.991 --> 16:05.726
and that if he thought we actually
burned down the building,

16:05.761 --> 16:07.562
he'd say something.
Believe me.

16:07.596 --> 16:08.529
Maybe he just doesn't
know what to say.

16:08.564 --> 16:10.665
Or maybe he doesn't
want to say anything.

16:10.699 --> 16:13.868
Maybe he wants to keep whatever
information he has to himself.

16:13.902 --> 16:18.539
Like there's no evidence that we had
anything at all to do with that fire.

16:18.574 --> 16:21.676
Dylan, you and I both know we were
in the lab with a Bunsen burner

16:21.710 --> 16:23.711
that we probably left
burning when we left.

16:23.745 --> 16:25.646
I doubt it. What else
could have happened?

16:25.681 --> 16:28.783
I don't know. But the
security guard let us in.

16:28.817 --> 16:30.718
He could have let
other people in.

16:30.752 --> 16:34.522
He's an idiot. Maybe he set the fire.
Just let it go.

16:34.556 --> 16:37.525
Yore kind of scaring me with how
cool you are about all of this.

16:37.559 --> 16:39.560
That's because
we didn't do anything.

16:39.595 --> 16:40.695
I just wish we could be sure
that we didn't do anything.

16:40.729 --> 16:44.665
Ben, I know this all
seems bad right now,

16:44.700 --> 16:45.867
but something good
will come of this.

16:45.901 --> 16:47.635
What? What possible good
could come from this?

16:47.669 --> 16:49.704
You haven't heard?
Heard what?

16:49.738 --> 16:52.840
It's going to take at least a
year to rebuild the school,

16:52.875 --> 16:56.644
so they're leasing space
from the city,

16:56.678 --> 17:01.482
and that space is your school.

17:01.517 --> 17:02.817
We're going to be going to
school together after all.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.521
Ben?

17:06.555 --> 17:08.489
And you're not afraid that might
be interpreted as motive?

Hi, there.
Hi.

17:15.731 --> 17:18.699
So Henry didn't stay long.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.602
He just dropped by, but I was
waiting on a call from Dylan.

17:21.637 --> 17:22.703
And Dylan called.

17:22.738 --> 17:24.771
I wanna ask you something

17:24.806 --> 17:27.575
that I've been wanting
to ask you all week,

17:27.608 --> 17:29.777
and I already know
the answer to this question,

17:29.811 --> 17:33.714
so I want you to answer it
carefully and truthfully.

17:33.749 --> 17:37.752
Did you and Dylan have something to
do with that fire at her school?

17:37.786 --> 17:38.719
What?

17:39.888 --> 17:42.557
No. Absolutely not.

17:42.591 --> 17:43.658
That's your answer?

17:43.725 --> 17:44.659
That's my answer.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.936
Your mother wants to know
if you want to go to her place tomorrow.

17:57.056 --> 17:58.367
No, why would she think that?

17:58.487 --> 18:00.055
I don't know, what are
you doing this weekend?

18:00.123 --> 18:00.923
Do you have
something better to do

18:00.957 --> 18:02.224
than going to
see your own mother?

18:02.259 --> 18:03.559
I don't have any plans.

18:03.593 --> 18:06.328
I just spent weeks running all
over Europe with my own mother.

18:06.363 --> 18:08.430
I've seen enough of my own mother.
I have a life, too.

18:08.465 --> 18:10.165
Your mom needs you
for emotional support.

18:11.501 --> 18:13.335
You can't just hang out
in your room forever.

18:13.370 --> 18:15.404
It's very stressful
being around this family.

18:15.438 --> 18:17.473
Just saps all my energy.

18:17.507 --> 18:19.408
I just got home a week ago
and all hell's broken loose.

18:19.442 --> 18:23.178
So do you mind if I take comfort
in my bed in my bedroom

18:23.213 --> 18:24.346
for a week, maybe two weeks,

18:24.381 --> 18:26.215
and then I'll get out
of your way!

18:31.354 --> 18:32.254
Oh, hey.

18:34.157 --> 18:37.126
Sorry I'm late, there was
an incident on the bus.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.394
But I'm ready to watch John

18:38.428 --> 18:41.330
if he's asleep in bed with very
little chance of waking up

18:41.364 --> 18:43.232
before you get back
from Kathleen's.

18:43.266 --> 18:45.167
Me and Moose ran him around
the yard for an hour,

18:45.201 --> 18:48.170
he could hardly stay awake long enough
to eat his dinner. He should be fine.

18:48.204 --> 18:51.173
All right, go, I got it.

18:51.207 --> 18:53.142
Oh! By the way, um,

18:53.176 --> 18:55.077
where are Amy and Ricky?

18:55.111 --> 18:57.112
They went somewhere,
I don't know.

18:57.147 --> 18:58.380
I don't know.
School was over today

18:58.415 --> 19:00.082
and they wanted to go away
for a night, what do I care?

19:00.116 --> 19:01.250
I don't care either,
I'm just asking.

19:01.284 --> 19:02.384
I'll see you later.

19:03.453 --> 19:05.220
So how are things
going with Kathleen?

19:07.290 --> 19:09.291
Who wants to know?
Me.

19:09.326 --> 19:11.093
We're not doing anything,

19:11.127 --> 19:12.428
we're just hanging out
together having a good time.

19:12.462 --> 19:17.132
Really? So you're okay being in
a sexless relationship again?

19:17.167 --> 19:19.401
What again? I wasn't in a
sexless relationship before.

19:19.436 --> 19:21.337
Anne and I had sex
and plenty of it!

19:21.371 --> 19:23.439
Hmm. Would you two stop talking!

19:23.473 --> 19:25.240
I remind you,
you and I were friends

19:25.275 --> 19:26.241
long before you and
Anne were friends.

19:26.276 --> 19:28.177
You were my friend first.

19:28.211 --> 19:28.944
I know. And I am still
your friend, George.

19:28.978 --> 19:30.412
But you don't answer your phone

19:30.447 --> 19:31.447
and neither does Amy or Ashley,

19:31.481 --> 19:35.150
and Anne is feeling
very vulnerable right now.

19:35.185 --> 19:36.418
So unless you want to
talk to her...

19:36.453 --> 19:38.487
No, no. I know she's going
through some stuff,

19:38.521 --> 19:41.290
but that's not my area,
you talk to her.

19:41.324 --> 19:43.292
Just not about me.
About her. Goodnight.

19:43.326 --> 19:45.327
So we don't know where
Amy and Ricky are?

19:45.362 --> 19:48.197
They're not here,
that's where they are.

19:48.231 --> 19:50.165
Amy asked me if I would pick up
John and I wanted to see him,

19:50.200 --> 19:52.167
so I picked him up. They'll
be home tomorrow by lunch.

19:52.202 --> 19:56.138
They didn't go to Vegas or
anything like that, did they?

19:56.172 --> 19:57.106
What if they did?

19:57.140 --> 20:00.409
Well, if they did go
to Vegas for a night,

20:00.443 --> 20:02.443
then I'd say
maybe they might be...

20:04.280 --> 20:05.414
They might be getting married!

20:05.448 --> 20:07.149
Or they got married!

20:07.183 --> 20:08.083
Married? What?

20:08.118 --> 20:10.252
Why would they go
away for the night?

20:10.286 --> 20:12.154
I don't know. Because they live
in a shack above a meat store

20:12.188 --> 20:13.255
and they wanted to get out?

20:13.289 --> 20:14.423
Don't jump to
conclusions like that.

20:14.457 --> 20:16.225
Like them getting married.

20:16.259 --> 20:17.359
Married? Geez.

20:17.394 --> 20:19.261
I don't know, that's just
what came into my head.

20:19.295 --> 20:20.295
Well, you got a weird head.

20:20.330 --> 20:20.629
I know.

20:20.663 --> 20:22.364
Married!

20:23.500 --> 20:24.500
And so what if they did?

20:24.534 --> 20:26.502
What do you mean
what if they did?

20:26.536 --> 20:28.203
What if you and Anne and
Margaret and Shakur and I

20:28.238 --> 20:29.505
missed seeing
those two get married?

20:29.539 --> 20:31.273
They're living together and
they have a child together,

20:31.307 --> 20:32.441
does it make sense to you
to spend money

20:32.475 --> 20:34.376
on throwing them a big wedding?

20:34.411 --> 20:36.111
You know, I hope they did go
to Vegas and get married.

20:36.146 --> 20:37.413
But I seriously doubt it.
Goodnight.

20:37.447 --> 20:39.381
And do not talk to Anne
about this.

20:51.461 --> 20:52.027
You still didn't tell him?

20:52.061 --> 20:54.463
No. Not the right time.

20:54.497 --> 20:56.265
He's going to find out
sooner or later

20:56.299 --> 20:58.167
and when he does,
he's going to freak out.

20:58.201 --> 21:00.202
There is no right time.

21:00.236 --> 21:01.370
Although before we did anything

21:01.404 --> 21:02.504
might have been
better than after.

21:02.539 --> 21:04.239
I don't really care.

21:05.508 --> 21:07.142
It's none of his business.

21:07.177 --> 21:09.211
And if he makes it
his business, well...

21:11.448 --> 21:13.382
I'm not afraid of him.
I am.

21:13.416 --> 21:16.351
Well, don't be. We don't have
to tell him what we're doing,

21:16.386 --> 21:20.322
but I am not going to
hide from him.

21:20.356 --> 21:23.492
I don't care what he thinks.
He or my own mother.

21:23.526 --> 21:25.461
Besides, he's too wrapped
up with wife number one

21:25.528 --> 21:27.529
to even know that
you're over here.

21:27.564 --> 21:29.465
He's like a dog, he can only
focus on one thing at a time

21:29.532 --> 21:32.201
and right now,
he's focused on her.

21:32.235 --> 21:33.502
I just don't want him
to focus on me.

21:33.536 --> 21:35.504
He's going to
blame me for this.

21:35.538 --> 21:37.038
Just don't worry about it.

Oh. Nora.

21:48.384 --> 21:50.219

Hi.
Toby.

Do you have any idea where Amy is?
Amy and Ricky?

21:56.493 --> 21:58.427
Their apartment?

21:58.461 --> 22:00.429
They went out of town
for the night.

22:00.463 --> 22:02.531
Your dad and I are
babysitting John.

22:02.565 --> 22:04.533
Wouldn't that require
your being near the baby?

22:04.567 --> 22:08.203
I've got the Walkie-Talkie.
I know how to use it.

22:08.238 --> 22:11.473

think they would...

22:11.508 --> 22:16.411
Like they would run off and get
married or anything like that?

22:16.446 --> 22:18.247
I hope so. I sure as hell don't
want to be at that wedding.

22:18.281 --> 22:20.315
Is anyone uncomfortable?

22:20.350 --> 22:22.317
I thought you might
know something.

22:22.352 --> 22:23.385
No.

22:23.419 --> 22:25.320
All right.

22:25.355 --> 22:27.189
I just have this gut feeling.

22:27.223 --> 22:28.323
Why don't you just call Ricky?

22:28.358 --> 22:30.259
Oh, I don't know.

22:30.293 --> 22:32.294
No, that seems
rather intrusive.

22:32.328 --> 22:33.395
And yet...

22:33.429 --> 22:34.463
He won't care.

Are you two like...

22:42.472 --> 22:45.140
Us? No.
Not at the moment.

22:45.174 --> 22:46.341
Does your dad know he's here?

22:46.376 --> 22:49.177
Toby. And no.
He does not.

22:50.313 --> 22:53.148
Well, I never saw you.

22:53.182 --> 22:54.249
Wait a minute.
Does your mother know?

22:55.318 --> 22:57.319
This is none of my business.

22:57.353 --> 22:58.353
No, it isn't.

do carry on, be safe.

carded over a bottle of champagne,

about how old we are.

but he's your dad.

him when we left the chapel.

Yeah, we probably should have.

No, no. I said we weren't
calling anyone so...

We can just explain to them
when we get back.

so they can leave us alone.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.296
Forgive me Lord, I have
ruined my life with sex!

28:51.330 --> 28:55.200
I could have been somebody!
I could have been a contender.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.035
Guys used to
fall over themselves

28:57.069 --> 29:00.172
looking at me in the hallway.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.940
I was the "it" girl
of Grant High!

29:01.974 --> 29:05.143
I was the hot virgin that
everyone wanted to have sex with!

29:06.212 --> 29:07.279
And then I had sex.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.281
And now I'm just like
every other girl in school!

29:09.315 --> 29:12.017
I've made my whole life
about boys and sex, and...

29:12.051 --> 29:15.287
And then I kissed Adrian!

29:15.321 --> 29:18.023
God! How could I kiss Adrian!

29:18.057 --> 29:20.025
How could I ask her to kiss me!
She's my best friend!

29:20.059 --> 29:22.327
Now I just don't
have a best friend!

29:22.361 --> 29:24.162
I am a giant loser!

29:24.197 --> 29:26.198
Because sex made me
a giant loser!

29:26.232 --> 29:28.333
I don't want to be
a giant loser!

29:28.367 --> 29:31.269
I don't want to
have sex anymore.

29:31.304 --> 29:34.105
From this point forward, I'm
not gonna have sex anymore.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.307
With God as my witness,

29:35.341 --> 29:37.342
I'm never gonna have sex
again until I'm married!

29:37.376 --> 29:39.044
And this time I mean it, okay?

29:39.078 --> 29:41.012
I really...
I really mean it this time.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.148
Is this a good time?

29:44.050 --> 29:46.184
(SIGHS)

29:46.219 --> 29:49.387
Yeah. Jack, actually, I want
you to be the first to know.

29:50.423 --> 29:52.157
I am going back to church.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.059
Oh, good.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.194
Yeah, my dad says attendance
is really off this summer.

29:56.229 --> 29:59.297
He was hoping to get things
going again in the fall.

29:59.332 --> 30:03.034
I mean, we weren't going to
have sex anyway, were we?

30:03.069 --> 30:04.336
Well, I was still
thinking about it,

30:04.370 --> 30:08.139
and then tonight,
just now, it hit me.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.076
I don't want to have sex again.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.477
Unless I'm married.

30:12.511 --> 30:15.046
All right, well, I don't think you
need to get all Christian again

30:15.081 --> 30:17.382
just to have a reason
not to have sex.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.351
I mean, if you don't wanna have
sex, you don't have to have sex.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.119
What's going on?

30:21.153 --> 30:22.220
Lots of things, I guess.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.389
With you.
Oh. With me?

30:24.423 --> 30:26.091
Um...

30:27.159 --> 30:30.328
Well...
You remember that girl

30:30.363 --> 30:31.162
that I made out with
at the party,

30:31.197 --> 30:34.032
your old boyfriend's
girlfriend?

30:34.066 --> 30:36.334
Daniel's girlfriend? The one who's
friends with Ben's girlfriend?

30:36.369 --> 30:39.037
The skanky looking one?

30:39.071 --> 30:41.440
Or sexy. However you
choose to look at it.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.176
What about her? I'm going
to go out with her.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.078
I've kind of been out with her.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.047
Well, I'll pray for you.

30:49.081 --> 30:52.987
All right. Well, goodnight. That was
easier than I thought it would be.

30:59.642 --> 31:00.984
Hey, honey. You asleep?

31:01.224 --> 31:03.064
I think your mom might be
on her way down here.

31:03.184 --> 31:04.951
Although I texted her to wait
until tomorrow morning.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.109
TOBY: Oh, no.
ASHLEY: Shh!

31:06.229 --> 31:09.164
What are you doing
in bed so early?

31:09.198 --> 31:11.066
Where did you get
the two other feet?

31:11.100 --> 31:12.983
Whose feet are those?

31:13.973 --> 31:15.774
They're mine, sir.

31:15.808 --> 31:17.943
What the hell is going on?

31:17.977 --> 31:22.211
Nothing's going on, we were
just sleeping. Right now.

31:22.331 --> 31:23.169
(GASPS)

31:23.289 --> 31:25.843
We've had sex before,
but we were just sleeping.

31:26.853 --> 31:28.687
Don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.755
I'm not going to kill you.
I might punch you.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.323
You're not going
to punch anyone.

31:33.593 --> 31:35.694
Why are you getting so upset?

31:35.728 --> 31:37.729
No one is pregnant here.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.598
No one is doing anything wrong.
We're safe.

31:39.632 --> 31:40.973
God. Ashley!

31:41.093 --> 31:42.323
What?

31:42.443 --> 31:44.870
What did you expect? We traveled
across the country together.

31:44.904 --> 31:50.218
Not "together" together. This is
new, we just started doing this.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.612
You're not going
to cry, are you?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.130
It's better than punching me.

31:56.355 --> 31:59.751
I don't blame you if you do punch
me, but it's okay for boys to cry.

32:00.887 --> 32:02.158
I even feel like crying.

32:02.278 --> 32:04.689
Well, don't. Not if you want to
keep doing what we're doing.

32:13.900 --> 32:17.002
All right, just turn out the light.
Let's go back to sleep.

32:23.743 --> 32:26.988
No, I know they did it.
That girl is evil.

32:27.108 --> 32:30.596
Evil, I tell you. She doesn't
fool me for one minute.

32:31.918 --> 32:33.685
(SIGHS)

32:33.719 --> 32:36.922
Yeah, I know, Ben is
stupid, but he's not evil.

32:36.956 --> 32:39.524
And you want to have
more children? With me?

32:39.558 --> 32:40.759
Well, yes, I do.

32:40.793 --> 32:43.695
Sooner or later, they all get into trouble.
All of them.

32:43.729 --> 32:44.729
Well, I'm sure you got
into some trouble, too.

32:44.764 --> 32:47.766
Yeah, but not
this kind of trouble.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.768
You don't even know what this kind of
trouble is, you don't know what he did.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.670
I don't think Ben
even knows what he did.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.773
Well, he could say that. He could
tell me that, but no, he lied.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.809
I'm sure if Ben had something to do
with that fire, it was an accident.

32:57.843 --> 33:00.578
It was an accident that happened when
they were illegally in the school,

33:00.613 --> 33:02.580
and had, apparently,
lit a Bunsen burner.

33:02.615 --> 33:04.816
A Bunsen burner?
You left that part out.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.851
Yeah. What the hell
were they thinking about?

33:06.886 --> 33:11.623
It takes one bad decision
to ruin a life. Just one.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.826
And unfortunately he's made one
after another after another.

33:15.928 --> 33:16.695
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

33:19.665 --> 33:20.799
Who is it?

33:20.833 --> 33:22.600
RUBEN: It's your dad.

33:25.705 --> 33:27.939
Hi! What are you
doing here?

33:27.974 --> 33:30.608
Hey! What are you doing
with a bat?

33:30.643 --> 33:32.644
Well, I didn't know who
was at the door. Come in.

33:32.678 --> 33:37.949
Uh, don't open the door to a
stranger just carrying a bat, okay?

33:39.785 --> 33:40.885
Are those for me?

33:40.920 --> 33:43.822
Oh, yeah. They're
from your mother and me.

33:43.856 --> 33:46.691
She missed a connection. She
was really trying to get here.

33:46.726 --> 33:49.694
We both wanted
to say congratulations.

33:49.729 --> 33:53.698
Aw, thank you. You didn't
have to, it's no big deal.

33:53.733 --> 33:56.668
Hey, listen.
It is a big deal.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.738
And, look, truthfully, Adrian,

33:59.772 --> 34:00.705
your mom and I were just going
to call you this weekend

34:00.740 --> 34:03.775
and maybe go out
to dinner or something,

34:03.809 --> 34:04.642
but your counselor called.

34:04.677 --> 34:08.646
Oh, so she's not
so bad after all.

34:08.681 --> 34:12.583
I'm very proud of you,
and so is your mom.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.518
And I came right over here
with those flowers,

34:14.553 --> 34:16.688
hoping you weren't out
for the night.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.590
And hoping you weren't in
for the night with Omar.

34:18.623 --> 34:24.661
Oh, Omar and I broke up.

34:24.697 --> 34:27.565
What? Why, I never even
got a chance to meet the guy.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.568
Yeah. You'd like him.
I like him.

34:30.603 --> 34:32.003
What happened?

34:32.038 --> 34:36.741
I don't know. He's graduating from
college and getting his masters,

34:36.775 --> 34:39.710
and he's very serious
about life right now.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.681
And, well, I'm very serious
about school right now.

34:43.716 --> 34:46.684
I'm really looking forward
to starting college.

34:46.719 --> 34:50.655
And I'm hoping to kind of leave
behind who I was in high school,

34:50.688 --> 34:52.556
and be who I really want to be.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.159
And who is that?

34:54.193 --> 34:55.592
The kind of woman my daughter would
have been proud of to have as a mother.

34:56.896 --> 34:57.695
Oh, Adrian.

34:57.730 --> 35:01.766
No, it's okay.
I'm not so sad anymore.

35:01.801 --> 35:07.672
I mean, I still think about her all
the time and about what happened.

35:07.706 --> 35:11.776
I just, I don't think I'm going
to be ready to get married

35:11.811 --> 35:13.878
or have a family any
time in the near future.

35:13.913 --> 35:15.613
Did you tell Omar that?

35:15.648 --> 35:18.850
No. I thought if I did,
I might lose him.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.820
And as it turns out,
I lost him anyway.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.855
Maybe it just wasn't
the right time.

35:24.924 --> 35:26.925
He's a really nice guy.

35:26.959 --> 35:30.695
Look, you're going to meet a lot of
nice guys when you get to school,

35:30.729 --> 35:33.665
but listen,
stick to your plan, okay?

35:33.699 --> 35:35.867
Finish college,
go to law school

35:35.901 --> 35:37.802
and then think
about marrying Omar,

35:37.837 --> 35:38.770
or whatever guy you end
up falling in love with.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.706
And until then,

35:41.740 --> 35:44.709
you can count on me to lean on any
time you need a guy to lean on.

35:46.612 --> 35:50.949
I wasn't there for you growing
up, but I am here now.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.618
And I'm never too busy for you.

35:55.688 --> 35:57.722
And I hope you don't get too busy
for me when you go to school.

35:58.824 --> 35:59.891
Thanks, Dad.

36:01.026 --> 36:02.727
Anytime.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.900
So, uh, you seen Ben lately?

36:08.934 --> 36:12.871
No, he's all involved with some crazy
redhead from the private school.

36:12.905 --> 36:17.709
What do you mean by crazy? Crazy
because she smokes pot or something?

36:17.743 --> 36:20.645
Oh, I forgot I told you
about that,

36:20.679 --> 36:22.814
about Ben and her smoking pot.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.783
I don't know,
she just seems crazy.

36:25.818 --> 36:27.785
Like, she's nice
on the outside,

36:27.820 --> 36:29.888
but not so nice on the inside.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.856
I don't know, something
is off with that chick.

36:31.891 --> 36:33.024
Off?
Yeah.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.893
Well, she can't be too off
if Ben likes her, right?

36:34.927 --> 36:38.930
Well, you know Ben,
he likes us bad girls.

36:38.964 --> 36:42.567
So you think you and Ben
will ever get back together?

36:42.601 --> 36:43.902
Ricky and I have a better
chance of getting back together

36:43.936 --> 36:44.936
than Ben and me.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.672
Okay.
Good to know.

36:58.851 --> 36:59.984
Hello.

37:04.757 --> 37:05.823
We're doing
my favorite thing again,

37:05.858 --> 37:09.827
sneaking around at night
in strange places.

37:09.862 --> 37:11.763
Isn't the park spooky at night?

37:11.797 --> 37:12.730
A little.

37:17.803 --> 37:23.942
Dylan, I can't
really live like this,

37:23.976 --> 37:25.843
I have to tell my dad
what happened.

37:26.845 --> 37:30.615
'Cause I think I recall
your dad telling you

37:30.649 --> 37:32.884
that if you got into any trouble
with me, you're on your own.

37:32.918 --> 37:36.721
Yeah, but... I mean,
this is big trouble.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.822
Or no trouble at all.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.593
Ask your dad. Please,
ask your dad about it.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.595
And just tell him we were there,
and just see what he says.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.897
I've got to know, Dylan.

37:45.931 --> 37:50.568
Okay, Ben,
I'll ask him. Promise.

37:50.603 --> 37:53.805
But that doesn't mean he'll tell
me what he knows. He can't.

37:55.708 --> 37:59.577
Come on, what are we
talking about this for?

37:59.612 --> 38:02.680
Let's talk about school. I can't believe
we're going to be in the same school.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.549
Yeah, only if we're not
in jail.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.784
Oh, Ben,
you're just so dramatic.

38:06.819 --> 38:07.619
It'll be fine.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.856
It will.

38:11.890 --> 38:16.728
And even if it's not, even if we did
accidentally burn down the school,

38:16.762 --> 38:18.630
our dads will take care of it.

38:18.664 --> 38:22.700
Look, Dylan, I don't think that
we should be seeing each other.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.572
I am realizing

38:27.606 --> 38:33.778
that I am not as oblivious

38:33.812 --> 38:36.781
to the rules and...

38:36.815 --> 38:41.719
And the law. You are, and I'm...
I'm a worrier.

38:41.754 --> 38:45.523
I'm a worrier,
and I can't handle this.

38:45.557 --> 38:50.662
Ben Boykewich, you are
not breaking up with me.

38:50.696 --> 38:53.798
Unless you don't want
my dad to protect you, too.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.767
What?

38:56.835 --> 38:58.536
I'm joking.
Oh.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.737
I'm joking.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.706
Are you?

39:01.740 --> 39:07.745
Ben, we got in this together, and we're
going to get out of it together.

39:07.780 --> 39:13.618
And we can't do that if
we break up, now can we?

39:13.652 --> 39:16.654
I didn't say I wanted
to break up, I just...

39:16.689 --> 39:17.655
It's going to be fine.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.737
Took you long enough.

39:32.771 --> 39:35.606
You knew I'd want
to come talk to you?

39:35.641 --> 39:36.574
Yeah.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.578
How'd you know?

39:40.612 --> 39:41.979
Because you're a decent guy, and
that's what a decent guy would do.

39:42.014 --> 39:46.918
Which doesn't mean I approve of
you sleeping with my little girl.

39:46.952 --> 39:50.788
I didn't figure you'd be
too happy about this,

39:50.823 --> 39:54.859
but Ashley wanted this and, of
course, I wanted this. And...

39:56.695 --> 39:59.564
I love her.

39:59.598 --> 40:00.698
You better love her. And you
better not love anyone else.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.667
And you better not
get her pregnant.

40:02.701 --> 40:03.701
No, of course not.

40:03.736 --> 40:05.603
That's how babies
are made, you know.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.539
I know. But she's on the pill
and we're using condoms, and...

40:08.574 --> 40:11.576
No more details.
That's enough.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.810
Is, uh, Anne coming here tonight

40:12.845 --> 40:13.678
because she knows
we're sleeping together?

40:13.712 --> 40:15.680
How would she know?
I didn't tell her.

40:15.714 --> 40:16.848
That other woman
might have told her.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.950
Who? Nora?

40:18.984 --> 40:21.619
Nora knows you two are doing what
you're doing and she didn't tell me?

40:21.653 --> 40:23.621
She just found out.
Tonight.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.056
Oh, great!

40:25.090 --> 40:26.758
Then I think we can count on Anne
coming here as soon as possible.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.626
God, I'm in so much trouble!

40:28.660 --> 40:29.694
I thought I was the one
in trouble.

40:29.728 --> 40:30.928
Nah, you're just a stupid kid.

40:32.998 --> 40:36.801
I told Ricky and Amy I'd babysit
if they wanted to go elope.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.737
I even paid for the hotel.
Because I don't believe in this,

40:39.772 --> 40:41.706
in two kids living together
and doing what you're doing.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.840
I'm not living with Ashley.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.543
Can I go tell her this?

40:45.577 --> 40:46.644
No! Don't tell her anything.

40:46.678 --> 40:47.712
Isn't it going to get out?

40:47.746 --> 40:48.880
Yeah, and when it does,
you act surprised.

40:48.914 --> 40:52.550
Yeah, okay.

40:52.584 --> 40:55.520
But if Ashley
and I didn't tell her...

40:55.554 --> 40:56.788
You want to be part
of this family?

40:56.822 --> 40:58.638
You learn to keep a secret!

40:58.963 --> 41:09.614
