NARRATOR: In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a miIitary court...

01:41.680 --> 01:43.091
for a crime they didn't commit.

01:43.182 --> 01:46.266
These men promptIy escaped
from a maximum security stockade...

01:46.351 --> 01:47.846
to the Los AngeIes underground.

01:47.936 --> 01:51.519

if no one eIse can heIp...

01:54.109 --> 01:57.609

STRYKER: Bus?

07:10.342 --> 07:13.960
-Carter.
-This is Stryker. Herd got away.

07:14.054 --> 07:16.592

-How'd they get out?
-lt was that lndian again.

07:19.059 --> 07:22.808
-You let him get away again, too?
-No, sir. Not this time.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.849
You send him back to his reservation
in a basket, you hear?

07:49.673 --> 07:52.045
These men have been wanted
for over 10 years.

07:52.134 --> 07:54.091
lt's time that we closed the file.

07:54.178 --> 07:57.013
The case has been back burner
for years, General.

07:57.097 --> 07:58.176
lt's common knowledge...

07:58.265 --> 08:01.183
Col. Lynch has been waging
his own ridiculous little vendetta.

08:01.268 --> 08:04.851
Precisely why Col. Lynch is now out
and this matter is hanging fire.

08:04.938 --> 08:08.058
These three soldiers were tried
and convicted...

08:08.150 --> 08:11.186
because of extreme political pressure
at the time.

08:11.278 --> 08:14.314
Which is something
that you should understand.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.068
Yes, sir.

08:22.831 --> 08:26.081
They were practically forgotten about...

08:26.710 --> 08:29.332
within a couple of years of their escape.

08:29.421 --> 08:33.419
But Lynch keeps throwing balls
down their alley...

08:34.760 --> 08:37.298
and now he's mushroomed
this whole thing...

08:37.388 --> 08:42.511
into what's considered to be
a highly embarrassing series of situations.

08:42.601 --> 08:44.143
Look at that.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.932
December 3, '77, they relieved Col. Lynch...

10:22.493 --> 10:26.656
to shopkeepers whose storefronts
were destroyed by Lynch's actions.

10:26.747 --> 10:28.656
And then, last year...

10:28.832 --> 10:32.664
after the newspaper headlines said
they'd captured the Team...

10:32.753 --> 10:37.629
they escaped
from a full security military installation.

11:25.305 --> 11:27.594
GENERAL: l want you to bring the A-Team in.

11:27.683 --> 11:30.352
GENERAL: You were the best troubleshooter
the past two wars.

11:30.436 --> 11:33.555
Until extreme political pressures
knocked the hat off my career...

11:33.647 --> 11:36.565
and any possibility of furthering my rank.

11:42.573 --> 11:46.522
lt seems the very methods
that made me an embarrassment...

11:46.869 --> 11:49.241
and shuffled me off to the side...

11:49.329 --> 11:53.197
are the exact reasons l'm being considered
the best man for this job.

11:53.292 --> 11:56.079
GENERAL: l'm not saying--
DECKER: We know what you're saying...

11:56.170 --> 11:59.087
so let's don't dance around the floor once.

11:59.173 --> 12:03.420
Everybody heard the reports from 'Nam
on these guys. They were the best.

12:03.510 --> 12:06.962
Because they're fast, sharp and unorthodox.

12:07.056 --> 12:10.425
DECKER: The way to catch men like this
is to play by their rules.

12:10.517 --> 12:13.008
Which means there are none.

12:14.438 --> 12:17.439
What l'm interested in, Colonel, is results.

12:17.858 --> 12:22.603
l don't expect detailed reports on the whats,
hows or whens of their apprehension.

12:22.946 --> 12:24.738

19:52.855 --> 19:54.479
made by a couple of film students.

19:54.565 --> 19:59.274
So, l dub it in German
then l subtitle it back into English...

19:59.361 --> 20:02.315
and tell everyone
l brought it from overseas.

20:02.406 --> 20:04.363
