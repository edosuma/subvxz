01:03.480 --> 01:06.836
This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship Red Dwarf,

01:06.920 --> 01:10.310
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak,

01:10.400 --> 01:14.598
The only survivors were Dave Lister,
who was in suspended animation,

01:14.680 --> 01:18.355
and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold,

01:18.440 --> 01:20.431
Revived three million years later,

01:20.520 --> 01:23.432
Lister's only companions are
a life form who evolved from his cat

01:23.560 --> 01:26.393
and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation
of one of the dead crew,

01:29.000 --> 01:33.994
We've enough food to last 30,000 years,
but there's only one After Eight mint left,

01:34.080 --> 01:36.958
and everyone's too polite to take it,

01:38.120 --> 01:43.717
Let's see... "Astronavigation
and Engineering Structure Made Simple".

01:44.720 --> 01:46.711
That's Rimmer's.

01:47.480 --> 01:51.109
Ah-ha! "The Pop-Up Kama Sutra.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.717
"Zero Gravity Edition. " That's mine.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.957
"Arnold J Rimmer - A Tribute. "
What's this?

02:03.040 --> 02:06.749
- It's a video of my death.
- You videoed your death?

02:06.840 --> 02:09.957
- Holly did it for me.
- You're strange, Rimmer.

02:10.039 --> 02:13.237
Why? You have videos of weddings and births.

02:13.320 --> 02:18.519
So, you have people around
and invite them to watch you snuff it?

02:18.600 --> 02:24.755
My death is one of the most important
things that ever happened to me.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.957
- Weird!
- What about these posters?

02:28.040 --> 02:31.715
- They're mine.
- But the Blu-Tack is mine.

02:31.800 --> 02:36.635
- You want the Blu-Tack?
- It is mine. I paid for it.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.508
There's one of your
old toenail clippings under the bed.

02:40.600 --> 02:45.754
This is the best decision I ever made.
No more of your stupid face.

02:45.840 --> 02:49.992
- No more of your stupid habits.
- Me? What did I do?

02:50.080 --> 02:54.710
You hummed.
Maliciously and persistently for two years.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.439
Every time I sat down to revise...

02:59.040 --> 03:03.352
Are you saying you never
became an officer because I hummed?

03:03.440 --> 03:05.908
Obviously not just that, Lister. Everything!

03:06.000 --> 03:09.754
- Everything you ever did held me back.
- Like what?

03:09.840 --> 03:12.308
Like using my mother's photograph
as an ashtray.

03:13.040 --> 03:18.273
I didn't know! I thought
it was a souvenir from Titan Zoo.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.634
Exchanging the symbols
on my revision timetable,

03:21.720 --> 03:24.996
so instead of taking
Engineering finals, I went swimming.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.551
The symbols fell off.
I thought I put them back right.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.076
Swapping my toothpaste
for a tube of contraceptive jelly.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.675
Come on! That was a joke.

03:36.760 --> 03:40.879
Yes, Lister, like putting my name
on the waiting list

03:40.960 --> 03:43.520
for experimental pile surgery.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.955
It's not all one-way, Rimmer.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.511
- You're hardly Mr Easy-To-Live-With.
- What are you talking about?

03:50.600 --> 03:53.717
You playing
your self-hypnosis tapes all night.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.394
"Learn Esperanto While You Sleep. "

03:56.480 --> 03:59.074
"Learn Quantum Theory While You Sleep. "

03:59.160 --> 04:03.119
- We both got the same benefit.
- Yeah, neither of us slept.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.273
You tied me hair to the bedpost,
then sounded the fire alarm!

04:07.360 --> 04:11.831
I was sick of you annoying me.
I don't have to explain.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.956
I nearly needed brain surgery!

04:14.040 --> 04:18.716
What brains? The point is,
you've always stopped me being successful.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.190
Rimmer, you can't blame me for your lousy life.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.317
- Oh, yes, I can.
- It's always the same.

04:25.400 --> 04:30.520
You never had the right pens.
Your dividers don't stretch far enough.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.591
- Well, they don't!
- See?

04:32.680 --> 04:37.708
You can't say, "I buggered up my life.
It's all Lister's fault!"

04:37.800 --> 04:43.591
Well, I'm not, am I? I'm moving out.
Out of Slob City and into Successville.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.798
- What? Next door?
- It's not the place, it's the company.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.759
I'm sharing with someone who'll give me
encouragement and understanding,

04:51.840 --> 04:54.718
the thrust and parry of meaningful conversation.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.394
- Everything tickety-boo?
- Absolutement, Mr Rimmer.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.471
I'll be along lickety-split.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.871
Carry on!

05:07.120 --> 05:09.111
What a guy!

05:09.200 --> 05:12.636
Why didn't I think of this before? Another me.

05:12.720 --> 05:16.349
Yeah, yeah... Shall I take this through?

05:16.440 --> 05:20.797
Be careful with that. It's an antique.
It's absolutely priceless.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.714
"Absolutement", "tickety-boo", "lickety-split"...

05:28.800 --> 05:31.633
God, meaningful conversation!

05:32.520 --> 05:38.789
"Second Technician Arnold J Rimmer
and Second Technician Arnold J Rimmer. "

05:42.600 --> 05:46.639
Be careful with that. It's an antique.
It's absolutely priceless.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.633
- Gosh, I just said that!
- Did you? That's incredible!

05:50.720 --> 05:52.711
What a lovely story!

05:52.800 --> 05:56.793
Why have you got "No smoking" signs?
Neither of you smoke.

05:56.880 --> 06:01.795
Because they're our signs and we happen
to think they look rather striking.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.792
Whoa-ho-ho! What's all this?

06:04.880 --> 06:09.351
"Arnold's Tops With Us", "Arnie Does It Best"...

06:09.440 --> 06:12.034
This is very funny stuff.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.237
- Just go.
- Because your name's Arnold Rimmer,

06:15.320 --> 06:18.676
and even though these headlines
are about other people,

06:18.760 --> 06:22.275
you've put them on the wall,
so people think they're about you?

06:22.360 --> 06:27.434
- Shoo! Go on, out!
- This'll keep me laughing all winter!

06:27.520 --> 06:31.399
We don't have to put up
with your snidey remarks,

06:31.480 --> 06:34.597
your socks that set off the sprinkler system.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.275
- Vacate our new quarters.
- Bye-bye, Rimmer.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.591
No, sorry...
Bye-bye, bye-bye, Rimmer, Rimmer.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.432
Goit.

06:50.040 --> 06:54.238
Aow!
Hey! I'm looking so good today!

06:54.320 --> 06:57.915
If I looked any better, I'd be illegal!

06:59.240 --> 07:04.473
Hello, hello! Testing, testing!
One, one, one! Me, me, me!

07:04.560 --> 07:09.190
Attention, all lady cats.
I am feeling very, very sexy!

07:09.280 --> 07:11.748
Can you hear me, lady cats?

07:11.840 --> 07:13.990
My body is available!

07:14.080 --> 07:18.676
Please form a queue! No squabbling!
This is your lucky day!

07:23.480 --> 07:25.277
Ecstasy!

07:29.120 --> 07:31.918
We're talking mega-ecstasy bliss!

07:34.200 --> 07:39.320
I can hum as loud as I like, as long as I like.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.436
I'm a free man.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.632
And you see those socks? See 'em?

07:45.720 --> 07:49.759
They're going right where they belong,
all over the floor,

07:49.840 --> 07:53.389
where any self-respecting bachelor
would keep 'em.

07:53.480 --> 07:57.075
I can have the bottom bunk, the big bunk.

07:57.160 --> 08:02.280
I'm gonna leave the top off the shampoo.

08:02.360 --> 08:06.956
I'm going to squeeze the toothpaste
right from the middle.

08:07.040 --> 08:11.909
In fact, I'm gonna do all the things
that drove him bonkers!

08:12.000 --> 08:16.152
I'm gonna crack me knuckles.
I'm gonna grind me teeth.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.437
I'm gonna live for a change!

08:20.400 --> 08:23.995
Ooh, smeggin' hell!

08:32.720 --> 08:36.759
What's this? Video of Rimmer's death?

08:36.840 --> 08:41.549
Holly, get us some popcorn
and put the video on, would you?

08:41.640 --> 08:45.758
Well, I can just about
manage that, I suppose,

08:48.600 --> 08:51.558
"BSc", "SSc"? What's that?

08:51.640 --> 08:54.518
Bronze Swimming certificate
and Silver Swimming certificate.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.591
He's a total lunatic.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.309
Hello. This video pays homage to a man

09:00.400 --> 09:03.995
who fell short of greatness by a gnat's wing.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.039
Before we see a digitalised
recording of his final moments,

09:08.120 --> 09:12.238
there'll be a lengthy tribute,
interspersed with poetry read by me.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.311
Whoa! Spin on!

09:14.760 --> 09:16.751
Poetry in motion.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.597
.. and if it hadn't been for those people

09:20.680 --> 09:24.150
who kept dragging him down, pulling him back...

09:24.240 --> 09:26.231
Spin on!

09:27.240 --> 09:30.312
.. if you put Napoleon in quarters with Lister,

09:30.400 --> 09:32.834
he'd be in Corsica peeling spuds.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.717
Spin on!

09:35.960 --> 09:39.999
.. we see the final moments of Arnold J Rimmer.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.752
Yes!

09:41.840 --> 09:47.870
It was your job to fix it, Rimmer!
You can't do sloppy work.

09:47.960 --> 09:52.829
I know, sir, and I accept full
responsibility for any consequences.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.833
Emergency, There's an emergency going on,

09:56.920 --> 10:00.276
Will Arnold Rimmer please hurry
to White Corridor 159...?

10:00.360 --> 10:02.237
Gazpacho soup!

10:06.920 --> 10:08.512
Off.

10:10.200 --> 10:15.399
Gazpacho soup? Why were his last words
"gazpacho soup"?

10:15.480 --> 10:18.836
Attention, lady cats! Sensual emergency!

10:18.920 --> 10:20.990
Good lovin' needed bad!

10:21.080 --> 10:24.072
Aow! Hey, no girls here?

10:24.160 --> 10:29.757
What a waste of a good move! Shame.
I'm looking so dangerous, too!

10:29.840 --> 10:32.195
Aow! Yeah, yeah!

10:32.280 --> 10:35.078
Cat, what are you doing?

10:35.160 --> 10:37.196
I'm courting.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.071
Courting who?

10:40.160 --> 10:42.833
- Whoever shows up.
- I told you before,

10:42.920 --> 10:45.229
there's no other cats on board.

10:45.320 --> 10:51.793
If I believed that for one minute,
I'd go crazy! Aow! Yeah, yeah!

11:00.200 --> 11:03.715
Up, up, up! Stretch, stretch, stretch!

11:03.800 --> 11:05.711
- Stretch further!
- And rest.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.110
- No! Keep jumping!
- Absolutely. Through the pain barrier.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.191
- Jump, jump, jump!
- And rest.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.317
- What are you doing?!
- It's going all grey!

11:14.400 --> 11:17.995
- That's the pain barrier! Beat it!
- You're absolutely right.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.595
- And rest.
- Brilliant! That extra little bit.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.877
- What time do we get up?
- Early. 8.30.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.157
- No, earlier. 7.00.
- How about 6.00?

11:28.240 --> 11:31.710
- No, 4.30.
- That's the middle of the night!

11:31.800 --> 11:34.314
You wanted driving. I'm driving you.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.516
Once again, you're absolutely right.

11:36.600 --> 11:40.912
Holly, alarm call, 4.30 am.
Make it the extra loud one.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.752
Yes, Arnold, And Arnold,

11:42.840 --> 11:46.753
- What are you doing, Arnold?
- I'm going to bed, Arnold.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.435
It's 2 am. We can get in some revision.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.875
I'm getting up in a minute.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.394
You take Porous Circuits and Esperanto.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.358
I'll take Thermal Energy and Philosophy.

11:58.440 --> 12:03.116
- Fantastic! I'm in heaven!
- Better than sex.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.630
It's 4,30,
Here is your early morning alarm call,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.950
Off! Off! Off!

12:15.280 --> 12:18.875
That's it. Smooth and even. Up and down.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.470
Ah, Lister. Bonan matenon.
Didn't wake you, I trust?

12:24.560 --> 12:27.393
No, I haven't been to bed yet.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.711
But it's 5.05 am. It's practically lunchtime.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.791
What are you doing?

12:32.880 --> 12:38.273
It's called work, Lister.
W- O-R-K. It is in the dictionary.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.351
Come on, paint! Paint!

12:40.440 --> 12:43.432
Why is it the same colour as before?

12:43.520 --> 12:48.719
They're changing it
from ocean grey to military grey.

12:48.800 --> 12:53.032
- Looks exactly the same to me.
- No, no, no, no...

12:53.120 --> 12:55.759
That's the new military grey bit there...

12:55.840 --> 12:58.912
and that's the dowdy old ocean grey there.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.359
Or is it the other way around?

13:02.440 --> 13:06.035
It doesn't matter. It's very nice.
So, how's Mrs Rimmer?

13:06.120 --> 13:12.150
Tee-hee... Get into your cesspit or you
won't have the energy for a day's slob.

13:12.240 --> 13:16.028
I just wondered what you talked about and that.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.429
Millions of things, Lister.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.910
Apart from being a genius, he's a total delight.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.549
- He keeps me in stitches.
- He knows everything you know,

13:25.640 --> 13:28.837
and vice versa, so what do you talk about?

13:28.920 --> 13:33.914
We reminisce, chew over old times,
past glories... old girlfriends.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.994
- Oh, you mean Yvonne McGruder?
- Don't say it as if she's the only one.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.071
Name one other girlfriend, then.

13:41.160 --> 13:47.759
Lister, I'm far, far too much of a gentleman
to stoop to that shower-room mentality.

13:47.840 --> 13:52.356
All you need to know about
Yvonne McGruder is I gave her one.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.112
Fine, Rimmer. Very nice. Very, very nice.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.875
So, um... what's gazpacho soup?

14:00.680 --> 14:04.229
- What?
- They were your last words. Why?

14:04.320 --> 14:06.993
You've been watching my death video.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.958
That's private! It's for my enjoyment only!

14:10.040 --> 14:13.999
It just seems a strange thing
to say, "Gazpacho soup. "

14:14.080 --> 14:18.517
I didn't have time to bash out
a speech in iambic pentameter.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.239
I was hit by an atomic explosion.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.311
But why "gazpacho soup"?

14:23.400 --> 14:26.073
That is something you will never know.

14:26.160 --> 14:30.676
Arnold, you asked me to remind you
about your Esperanto revision,

14:30.760 --> 14:33.752
Thank you, Holly. You two, carry on.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.115
"A to Z of Red Dwarf. "

14:45.280 --> 14:48.716
I thought so!

14:50.920 --> 14:53.912
"My Diary", by Arnold J Rimmer.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.518
January 1st: "I have decided
to keep a journal of the coming year,

14:59.600 --> 15:04.071
"a daily chart of my progress
through the echelons of command,

15:04.160 --> 15:06.879
"so that one day, other aspiring officers

15:06.960 --> 15:09.758
"may seek enlightenment in these pages.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.991
"One day, this journal may take its place

15:13.080 --> 15:18.200
"alongside Napoleon's war diaries
and the memories of Julius Caesar. "

15:19.280 --> 15:21.271
Next entry...

15:22.600 --> 15:27.230
July 17th: "Auntie Maggie's Birthday. "

15:31.680 --> 15:35.434
November 25th: "Gazpacho soup day. "

15:36.600 --> 15:39.990
That's six weeks before the crew got wiped out.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.599
He won't find that one.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.148
Not until he changes his boots.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.549
Oh! Did you see him clearly?

15:52.640 --> 15:56.679
Could you spot him in a parade? I don't think so.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.194
I could've been anybody.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.956
Ten and three-quarter centimetres!

16:10.040 --> 16:15.160
Plus five for not breaking,
and that is a big, big score!

16:15.240 --> 16:19.916
The Browns have to do something
quite sensational. Quiet, please.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.991
Busy, Dave?

16:22.080 --> 16:24.071
Well, yeah, I am, actually.

16:24.160 --> 16:28.631
Then you won't care about the
super-lightspeed fighters tracking us,

16:28.720 --> 16:30.119
What?!

16:30.200 --> 16:33.636
- I'll leave you to your bubble blowing,
- No, come on.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.553
- They're from Earth,
- That's three million years away.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.393
They're from the Norweb Federation,

16:41.560 --> 16:45.394
- What's that?
- The North Western Electricity Board,

16:45.480 --> 16:49.234
- They want you, Dave,
- Me? Why? What for?

16:49.320 --> 16:52.232
- For your crimes against humanity,
- You what?!

16:52.320 --> 16:57.758
When you left Earth, you left two
half-eaten sausages in your kitchen,

16:57.840 --> 17:01.913
- Did I?
- Do you know what happens to sausages

17:02.000 --> 17:05.151
- after three million years?
- Yeah, they go mouldy.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.597
Your sausages, Dave, now cover
seven-eighths of the Earth's surface,

17:09.680 --> 17:13.434
Also, you left $17,50 in your bank account,

17:13.640 --> 17:17.394
Thanks to interest,
you own 9*% of the world's wealth,

17:17.480 --> 17:22.759
After three million years, nobody's got
any money except for you and Norweb,

17:22.839 --> 17:24.830
Why Norweb?

17:24.920 --> 17:28.151
You left a light on in the bathroom,

17:28.840 --> 17:33.072
I've got a final demand here
for $180 billion,

17:33.160 --> 17:36.436
$180 billion?! You're kidding?!

17:36.520 --> 17:38.715
April Fool,

17:40.080 --> 17:42.071
But it's not April.

17:42.160 --> 17:47.393
Yeah, but I couldn't wait six months
with a red-hot jape like that,

17:47.480 --> 17:50.119
So, you just made it up, then?

17:50.200 --> 17:53.476
Yeah, Bit of excitement for a while, wasn't it?

17:53.560 --> 17:55.790
You can't beat a good wheeze,

17:55.880 --> 17:59.429
I don't need a wheeze. I can do it myself.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.239
You haven't got a clue, You're useless,

18:02.320 --> 18:06.074
- Shh! What's that?
- I make you vomit?

18:06.160 --> 18:08.355
Keep your voice down!

18:08.440 --> 18:11.671
- I'm not gonna take this abuse.
- Oh, yes!

18:11.760 --> 18:15.673
When the going gets tough,
the tough cry in the corner.

18:15.760 --> 18:20.993
You've got a sponge for a backbone!
No wonder father hated you!

18:21.080 --> 18:23.719
That's a lie! Lie, lie, lie!

18:23.800 --> 18:27.839
- Why didn't he send you to the academy?
- He couldn't afford it!

18:27.920 --> 18:30.798
Oh! He sent all our brothers!

18:30.880 --> 18:33.553
You're a filthy, smegging, lying, smegging liar!

18:33.640 --> 18:36.393
Nobody likes you! Not even Mummy!

18:36.480 --> 18:39.392
Mummy did like me! Mummy was just busy.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.189
- She had a lot of meetings to go to.
- Twaddle!

18:43.280 --> 18:46.670
You better watch what you say about my mummy!

18:46.760 --> 18:49.320
Oh, grow up, Mr Gazpacho!

18:49.840 --> 18:55.676
- Mister what?
- I said Mr Gaz-pa-cho, deafie!

18:55.760 --> 18:59.719
- That is the most hurtful thing...
- Good!

18:59.800 --> 19:04.635
That is the last straw.
You're finished, Rimmer.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.359
No, you're finished, Rimmer!

19:14.360 --> 19:17.670
Ah, Lister... How are you?

19:18.280 --> 19:21.511
I'm tickety-boo. What do you want?

19:21.600 --> 19:25.513
I don't suppose you've got
that Blu-Tack, have you?

19:25.600 --> 19:27.556
Rimmer, it's 3 am!

19:27.640 --> 19:32.760
It doesn't matter. It can wait till morning.
I'm just gonna sleep here.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.798
- Everything all right, is it?
- Sure. Absolutely. Yeah, sure.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.475
- No problems, then?
- No. No, no.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.676
Things couldn't be hunky-dorier.

19:45.680 --> 19:50.390
It's just I thought I heard,
you know... raised voices?

19:51.920 --> 19:56.277
It's quite an amusing thought, isn't it?
Having a blazing row with yourself.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.313
Hit the wall! Go on!
Hit the wall! Yeah! Yeah!

20:02.400 --> 20:05.949
Shut up! I'm trying to sleep!

20:06.040 --> 20:09.396
Obviously, we have professional disagreements,

20:09.480 --> 20:12.597
but nothing with anything to it.
Nothing malicious.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.240
Shut up, you dead git!

20:16.640 --> 20:19.473
Excuse me a second, Lister, will you?

20:22.840 --> 20:28.312
Stop your foul whining,
you filthy piece of distended rectum!

20:31.680 --> 20:35.639
Lister, there's no point in concealing it anymore.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.554
Rimmer and me, we've had a bit of a tiff.

20:39.640 --> 20:44.794
Nothing major... but it goes
without saying, it was his fault!

20:55.240 --> 20:57.800
Miles from Earth?

20:57.880 --> 21:01.839
Deep in the Solar System
and you fancy a curry?

21:01.920 --> 21:05.549
Why not drop in
at the Titan Taj Mahal restaurant?

21:05.640 --> 21:09.872
Enjoy the finest Tandoori cuisine
at one-fifth gravity,

21:09.960 --> 21:13.270
Just a short space-walk from this cinema,

21:17.200 --> 21:19.430
- Shut up!
- Will you stop that?

21:19.520 --> 21:22.193
- I'm trying to watch!
- I'm only eatin'!

21:22.280 --> 21:25.078
Eating's when food goes in your mouth!

21:29.760 --> 21:31.876
- Afternoon.
- Yeah.

21:31.960 --> 21:35.111
- What's on?
- "Citizen Kane. "

21:35.200 --> 21:39.716
There's no smoking on this side.
You should be sitting over there.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.439
- Nobody's complaining.
- Yes, they are. I am.

21:42.520 --> 21:47.389
So, kindly move to the smoking area
for the convenience of other patrons.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.436
I thought you hated films.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.751
No. I did a film course at night school.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.718
"Citizen Kane", eh? That's Orson Welles, is it?

22:01.040 --> 22:03.759
That's "Citizen Kane" all right. Unmistakable.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.434
Why are you here? Where's your wife?

22:06.520 --> 22:09.796
Don't ask me. He's nothing to do with me.

22:09.880 --> 22:15.910
Last I saw, he was changing the paint
back to ocean grey. He's quite mad!

22:19.800 --> 22:21.153
Lister. Cat.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.591
Excuse me. I can't see.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.272
Shh.

22:27.360 --> 22:32.229
Excuse me, I can't see through
your stupid, sticky-out-eared head.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.993
- I'm trying to watch the film!
- Yeah!

22:35.080 --> 22:38.470
- Move!
- Look, I just chose a seat at random.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.120
If you're unhappy, I suggest you move.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.599
Right.

22:42.680 --> 22:46.593
Now, where shall I sit? So many to choose from.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.752
How about over there or over there?

22:49.840 --> 22:51.831
No, that's a nice seat!

22:53.320 --> 22:56.198
Look at this. Mr Maturity.

23:01.360 --> 23:04.432
Will you two guys just grow up?

23:04.520 --> 23:09.230
There's only one immature person
around here, and we all know who.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.189
Hello.
What do you think of Arnold Rimmer?

23:20.240 --> 23:22.959
This can't go on. One of you has gotta go.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.439
Yes, him.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.990
- It's clear which one has to go.
- Yes, you!

23:28.080 --> 23:31.550
I was here first. I nursed Listie
through those early, delicate days!

23:31.640 --> 23:35.997
We're exactly the same person.
Only you're mentally unstable.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.390
Ippy-dippy, my spaceshippy,
on a course so true...

23:39.480 --> 23:43.632
Past Neptune and Pluto's moon,
the one I choose is you.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.349
- Excellent decision.
- The one you end on stays, yeah?

23:47.440 --> 23:50.477
- It's you.
- Wait a minute. Hold your horses.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.676
It's your own fault, Rimmer.

23:52.760 --> 23:56.719
If you'd given me Kochanski's hologram,
this wouldn't have happened.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.791
Drive Room. Ten minutes.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.871
Drive Room. Five minutes.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.992
I don't believe it.
I've been ippy-dippied to death.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.554
- I want you out.
- What have I said?

24:15.640 --> 24:17.631
Just out!

24:17.720 --> 24:19.915
There's precious little entertainment around here.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.437
If you can't attend the odd execution,
what have you got left?

24:24.520 --> 24:26.238
Out! Go on!

24:28.440 --> 24:31.955
Don't forget to write...

24:32.040 --> 24:34.076
you great nancy!

24:39.120 --> 24:40.917
Lister.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.278
Fancy a drink?
I didn't know you had any medals!

24:45.360 --> 24:47.351
What are they?

24:47.440 --> 24:50.750
Three Years' Long Service,
Six Years' Long Service,

24:50.840 --> 24:54.230
Nine Years' Long Service,
Twelve Years' Long Service.

24:54.320 --> 24:58.359
- Come on, just one drink.
- I'll have a whisky.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.954
- Holly?
- How would you like it?

25:01.040 --> 25:05.511
Straight... with ice and lemonade,
a cherry and a slice of lemon.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.192
Another?

25:12.840 --> 25:14.637
And another.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.916
And another. Make it a double.

25:23.080 --> 25:27.358
So, what's this gazpacho soup business?
What's it all about?

25:27.440 --> 25:31.752
I suppose now I'm doomed, I can tell you.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.709
Gazpacho soup.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.475
It was the greatest night of my life.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.996
I'd been invited to the Captain's table.

25:43.080 --> 25:47.471
I'd only been with the company 14 years.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.994
Six officers and me!

25:51.080 --> 25:53.435
They called me "Arnold".

25:54.920 --> 25:57.434
We had gazpacho soup for starters.

25:58.120 --> 26:02.352
I didn't know gazpacho soup
was meant to be served cold.

26:03.360 --> 26:09.708
I called over the chef and told him
to take it away and bring it back hot.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.791
He did!

26:12.880 --> 26:16.555
The looks on their faces still haunt me today!

26:16.640 --> 26:20.076
I thought they were laughing at the chef,

26:20.160 --> 26:25.632
when they were laughing at me
as I ate my piping hot gazpacho soup!

26:27.480 --> 26:30.677
I never ate at the Captain's table again.

26:30.760 --> 26:34.833
- That was the end of my career.
- Anyone could've done that.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.469
If only they'd mentioned it in basic training!

26:38.560 --> 26:42.678
Instead of climbing up and down ropes
and crawling through tunnels.

26:42.760 --> 26:46.799
If only, just once, they'd said,
"Gazpacho soup is served cold!"

26:46.880 --> 26:49.553
I could've been an admiral by now!

26:50.640 --> 26:54.474
Instead of a nothing,
which is what I am, let's face it.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.233
- Oh, you're not a nothing.
- He is.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.914
- You're right!
- I know I'm right.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.752
I never got off the bottom rung.

27:03.840 --> 27:09.039
And do you know why? Because
I didn't have the right nobby parents.

27:09.120 --> 27:13.398
I bet Todhunter was served gazpacho soup
the moment he was on solids.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.630
No, I bet he was breast-fed with it!

27:17.720 --> 27:22.794
One side gazpacho soup and the other side
dispensing chilled champagne!

27:22.880 --> 27:26.589
Is this gonna go on all day?
I thought he was gettin' wiped!

27:27.800 --> 27:31.395
Yes, go on. Turn me off. Get rid of me.

27:31.880 --> 27:35.156
I've already done it. I wiped the other one.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.518
What?! You wiped... When?!

27:40.600 --> 27:45.151
- Just before you came in.
- And you let me bare my soul?

27:45.240 --> 27:51.554
Yeah! I wanted to know about gazpacho soup.
I knew you wouldn't tell me.

27:51.640 --> 27:57.351
Of course I wouldn't. You'd make
my life a hell with gazpacho soup jokes.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.431
Rimmer.

27:59.520 --> 28:04.435
I promise, I swear I will never,
ever mention this conversation again.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.239
And when I swear, I mean it.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.880
- You promise?
- I promise.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.951
Do you swear absolutely?

28:12.040 --> 28:16.431
I swear absolutely that I will never
mention gazpacho soup again!

28:16.520 --> 28:18.556
All right...

28:18.640 --> 28:23.236
You're a bit of a slob, but you keep your word.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.959
This time I'm gonna believe you.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.031
Let's go for another drink.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.159
Souper!

28:36.320 --> 28:39.995
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

28:40.080 --> 28:43.436
# I'm all alone, more or less

28:43.520 --> 28:46.637
# Let me fly far away from here

28:46.720 --> 28:49.473
# Fun, fun, fun

28:49.560 --> 28:53.075
# In the sun, sun, sun

28:53.160 --> 28:56.516
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

28:56.600 --> 28:59.876
# Drinking fresh mango juice

28:59.960 --> 29:03.236
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

29:03.320 --> 29:05.993
# Fun, fun, fun

29:06.080 --> 29:09.755
# In the sun, sun, sun

29:09.840 --> 29:12.513
# Fun, fun, fun

29:12.600 --> 29:16.673
# In the sun, sun, sun #

29:17.305 --> 29:23.520
