-WHEN YOUR BACK WAS THROWN UP
AGAINST THE ROCKS,

18:03.560 --> 18:07.260
WHILE NOTHING WAS BROKEN,
THE COMPRESSION THAT IT CAUSED

18:07.869 --> 18:10.350
LEFT BRUISING, WHICH, IN TURN,
CAUSED SWELLING.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.003
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE NO FEELING
BELOW YOUR WAIST.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.270
-HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
FOR THE SWELLING TO GO DOWN?

18:18.488 --> 18:20.229
-WELL, IT MAY BE SOME TIME

18:20.360 --> 18:21.752
BEFORE THE SWELLING GOES DOWN.

18:22.797 --> 18:26.192
AND YOU'LL NEED REHABILITATION
AND PHYSICAL THERAPY.

18:27.149 --> 18:28.019
AND TIME.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.550
-BUT I, UM...

18:37.855 --> 18:39.509
I AM GOING TO WALK?
I MEAN, I, UM...

18:41.990 --> 18:43.339
I AM GOING TO WALK AGAIN?

18:46.473 --> 18:49.040
-I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU
SOME GUARANTEES, MITCH,

18:50.129 --> 18:51.391
BUT I CAN'T.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.177
NOW, AS SOON AS YOU'RE ABLE,

18:55.308 --> 18:57.875
I'M GOING TO TRANSFER YOU
TO A REHABILITATION CENTER.

18:58.485 --> 19:02.228
AND I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH
THAT PHYSICAL THERAPY IS CRUCIAL

19:03.490 --> 19:04.665
IF YOU'RE TO WALK AGAIN.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.776
-WOMAN ON PA: PAGING DR. LATHAM,

YOU CAN GO SEE YOUR DAD NOW.

19:31.648 --> 19:32.954
-YEAH, OKAY.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.784
-DR. BONANN.
-YES?

19:37.872 --> 19:38.873
-PLEASE TELL ME THE TRUTH.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.268
UH, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES,
YOU KNOW...

19:42.398 --> 19:44.139
-FOR A FULL RECOVERY?
-MM-HMM.

19:44.792 --> 19:48.187
-WELL, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS A POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.015
IF PATIENTS KNEW THE ODDS
THEY WERE FACING,

19:51.581 --> 19:53.975
THEY COULD EASILY GIVE UP
BEFORE THEY EVEN START.

19:54.802 --> 19:59.285
-AND WHAT ARE THOSE ODDS?
-WITH THE LUMBAR COMPRESSION,

19:59.415 --> 20:00.982
I'D SAY THE ODDS
FOR A FULL RECOVERY

20:01.591 --> 20:03.637
ARE ABOUT FIVE PERCENT.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.118
-FIVE PERCENT?
-MM-HMM.

MIGHT NOT EVER WALK AGAIN.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.439
-DOCTOR: WELL,
THEN DON'T BELIEVE IT.

20:24.048 --> 20:27.008
MITCH IS GOING TO NEED ALL
THE SUPPORT, ENCOURAGEMENT

20:27.138 --> 20:29.271
AND POSITIVE ENERGY
THAT YOU CAN GIVE HIM.

20:30.751 --> 20:31.708
-OKAY?
-MM-HMM.

20:32.709 --> 20:33.623
-ALL RIGHT.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.107
-YOU KNOW, JASON, THERE'S
A LOT OF KIDS HERE YOUR AGE.

21:23.630 --> 21:24.848
I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA LIKE IT HERE.

21:25.632 --> 21:26.546
COME ON.

21:29.679 --> 21:30.724
YOU OKAY?

21:31.551 --> 21:33.248

IN A MOMENT, OKAY?

21:36.817 --> 21:40.168
-DR. ZACK, I SPENT OVER
A YEAR WORKING ON THIS CASE.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.089

21:48.611 --> 21:50.526
TRYING TO PROTECT HIS OLDER
BROTHER, WHO'S...

21:51.092 --> 21:53.834
MIXED UP WITH A GANG.
A DRUG DEAL WENT DOWN.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.445
JASON'S BROTHER DIDN'T MAKE IT.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.622
AND JASON IS MY ONLY WITNESS.

21:59.753 --> 22:02.016
-IT'S AN AWFUL LOT FOR A BOY
THAT AGE TO GO THROUGH.

22:02.538 --> 22:06.325
THAT AND A TRIAL?
-WELL, IT'S STILL A MONTH AWAY.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.502
