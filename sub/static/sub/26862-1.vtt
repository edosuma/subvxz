and, uh, practices,coaching clinics, film night...

09:47.836 --> 09:49.170
And you used tobe there with me.

09:49.212 --> 09:51.715
I had a life, too,things I wanted to do.

09:51.756 --> 09:53.842
You stopped supporting thatso long ago.

09:53.883 --> 09:54.843
That's not true!

09:54.884 --> 09:55.969
Yes, it is!

09:56.011 --> 09:57.387
You don't even ask meabout my writing anymore.

09:58.930 --> 10:00.307
When we talk,it's about the kids.

10:00.348 --> 10:04.060
I unload to Beth,you have your... confidante.

10:04.102 --> 10:05.145
Whatever you wantto call her.

10:05.186 --> 10:06.855
Abby,

10:06.896 --> 10:08.023
there's nothing to that.

10:08.064 --> 10:09.983
I know what I saw, John.

10:09.983 --> 10:11.276
You've seen friendship!

10:11.318 --> 10:13.153
And if I do have a friendshipoutside of our marriage,

10:13.153 --> 10:15.697
it's becauseI can't talk to you anymore.

10:22.245 --> 10:24.331
Look, Sam.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.000
We don'tlove each other

10:27.042 --> 10:28.835
the way a marriedcouple should.

10:28.877 --> 10:30.170
We don't eventalk to each other

10:30.170 --> 10:32.422
the way married people should.

10:33.673 --> 10:35.675
Nicole's at collegeand Kade's a senior.

10:35.675 --> 10:36.760
So I guess...

10:38.678 --> 10:40.722
there's nothing elseis keeping us together.

10:40.764 --> 10:43.016
You don't want timeto think it over?

10:43.058 --> 10:45.101
We're telling the kidsthis afternoon.

10:47.437 --> 10:49.731
Okay.

10:49.773 --> 10:51.149
I'll draw up the papers.

10:53.234 --> 10:55.653
[♪♪]

10:57.655 --> 10:59.532
[woman]: One, two,three, four...

10:59.532 --> 11:00.742

11:00.784 --> 11:03.286

11:03.328 --> 11:05.538
And through.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.707
And wraparound, and...

11:07.707 --> 11:08.667

11:08.708 --> 11:09.709
Beth?

11:09.709 --> 11:11.086
Yeah?Wrap around...

11:11.127 --> 11:13.380
Do you rememberhow Dad used to mumble

11:13.421 --> 11:14.756
when he was reallyfocused on something?

11:14.798 --> 11:16.883
Yeah. Don't remind me.

11:16.925 --> 11:18.093
That drove me crazy.

11:18.134 --> 11:20.762
You're doing it.Right now.

11:20.804 --> 11:22.055
Oh, you've gotto be kidding me.

11:22.055 --> 11:23.056
No.

11:23.098 --> 11:25.892
Great.

11:25.934 --> 11:27.977
Like it's not bad enoughI inherit his thighs,

11:28.019 --> 11:29.646
I have to gethis annoying habits, too.

11:29.687 --> 11:31.815
When did you startknitting anyway?

11:31.856 --> 11:33.316
Seems a little domestic for you.

11:33.358 --> 11:34.442
Not anymore.

11:34.484 --> 11:37.737
I have sworn off datingto become a spinster.

11:37.779 --> 11:39.406
Yeah, right.

11:39.447 --> 11:41.324
You haven't spenta Friday night alone

11:41.366 --> 11:42.409
since college.

11:42.450 --> 11:43.910
Well, that isall gonna change.

11:43.910 --> 11:46.913
Besides, have you seen the poolof single men in this town?

11:46.955 --> 11:49.416
[scoffs] I might as welljoin a convent.

11:49.457 --> 11:51.334
There's somebodyout there for you.

11:51.376 --> 11:53.795
Well, I hate to break itto you, Big Sis,

11:53.837 --> 11:55.588
but not everyone's lifeturns out like yours.

11:55.630 --> 11:57.090
When is Nicolegetting here?

11:57.132 --> 12:00.093
I can't stop thinkingabout this family meeting.

12:00.093 --> 12:01.845
Uh, she should behere in a few minutes.

12:01.886 --> 12:04.139
Well, that is my cue.

12:04.180 --> 12:07.976
Don't want to interruptthe family meeting!

12:08.017 --> 12:09.936
When did youtake up knitting?

12:09.936 --> 12:11.813
Not a peep outof you, Mister.

12:11.855 --> 12:14.774
You're inthe doghouse.

12:14.816 --> 12:16.484
What'd I do?

12:16.526 --> 12:19.863
Something aboutmumbling and big thighs.

12:22.115 --> 12:24.159
[♪♪]

12:31.040 --> 12:33.960
Man, did you see that?

12:33.960 --> 12:36.504
No. Sorry.What'd I miss?

12:36.546 --> 12:38.798
Those eagles.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.300
The femaledove to the ground

12:40.300 --> 12:42.385
and the malechased after her,

12:42.427 --> 12:45.346
saved her life.

12:45.388 --> 12:47.015
I read about itin science.

12:47.056 --> 12:48.016
It's a ritual

12:48.057 --> 12:49.476
where the maleproves his devotion.

12:49.476 --> 12:50.727
Crazy, right?

12:50.769 --> 12:51.728
Yeah.

12:51.769 --> 12:53.688
Eagles mate for life,did you know that?

12:53.730 --> 12:55.815
For life?

12:55.815 --> 12:58.109
Didn't know that.

13:00.445 --> 13:01.863
[car horn honking]

13:01.905 --> 13:04.449
Hey, come on.Your sister's home.

13:35.271 --> 13:36.564
I knowI should've called first,

13:36.606 --> 13:38.358
but I thought it'd bea nice surprise

13:38.358 --> 13:39.359
to bring Matt!

13:39.400 --> 13:41.027
It's okay,right, Mom? Dad?

13:43.446 --> 13:44.531
Oh, thank you, sir.

13:44.531 --> 13:46.574
I did tell Nicolethat we should call first.

13:46.616 --> 13:48.034
The more,the merrier.

13:48.034 --> 13:49.035
See? Told you!

13:49.035 --> 13:50.411
Best parents ever.

Oh, I told Mattyou made lots of food.

13:52.413 --> 13:53.414
Tell me you made--

13:53.456 --> 13:54.541
The famouschocolate cake?

13:54.582 --> 13:56.125
Oh, yeah! Alreadyin the kitchen!

13:56.167 --> 13:57.210
That's for dessert, you guys!

13:57.252 --> 14:00.088
And, besides...

14:00.129 --> 14:03.049
Uh, actually, we are havinga family meeting.

14:03.049 --> 14:04.259
Yeah, what's thatall about?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.885
Oh, it's not gonnatake too long, is it?

14:05.927 --> 14:06.928
I'm going fishingin, like, an hour.

14:06.970 --> 14:08.972
No. Won't take too long.

14:09.013 --> 14:10.473
Okay, well, let's go!

14:11.933 --> 14:13.977
-Come on in, you!-Get some of that cake!

14:14.018 --> 14:15.311
Oh, you look great.

14:17.105 --> 14:18.815
We can't tell themwith Matt here.

14:18.856 --> 14:21.192
I-- I'll take care of it.

14:26.406 --> 14:28.575
Hey.

14:28.616 --> 14:30.243
So, uh, Matt...

14:30.285 --> 14:32.412
we are very happyto have you here,

14:32.412 --> 14:34.414
but we did havethis family meeting planned.

14:34.414 --> 14:36.416
Would you mindgiving us a few minutes?

14:36.416 --> 14:37.458
Maybe check out the lake?

14:37.500 --> 14:38.626
Sure thing.

14:38.668 --> 14:40.003
I'll, uh,I'll step outside.

14:40.044 --> 14:42.088
Uh, wait.He should stay.

14:42.130 --> 14:44.632
He's...practically family.

14:44.674 --> 14:45.967
[Kade]:This sounds interesting.

14:46.009 --> 14:47.218
But sinceyou're all here...

14:50.680 --> 14:51.889
We're getting married!

14:53.182 --> 14:54.976
W-Wow!

14:55.018 --> 14:56.269
Wow.

14:56.311 --> 14:59.272
That is suchincredible news.

14:59.314 --> 15:00.607
-Congrats.-[Matt]: Thanks.

15:00.648 --> 15:02.150
I-I knowit seems fast,

15:02.191 --> 15:04.527
but after spending

15:04.569 --> 15:06.154
so much time togetherlast summer,

15:06.195 --> 15:07.405
all I could think was

15:07.447 --> 15:10.199
how much I loveyour daughter...

15:10.241 --> 15:13.369
and how much we wantexactly what you two have.

15:13.411 --> 15:14.579
Family.

15:14.621 --> 15:16.456
Faith.

15:16.497 --> 15:18.374
A love that lasts forever.

15:18.416 --> 15:19.959
[Kade]: I can't believe this!

15:20.001 --> 15:21.461
My sister is getting married.

15:21.502 --> 15:23.296
Now, this is so great.

15:23.338 --> 15:24.505
This callsfor a celebration!

15:24.547 --> 15:26.299
Unless the family'smeeting can top that,

15:26.341 --> 15:27.967
I say it's timefor cake.

15:27.967 --> 15:28.968
-Go, cake.-Yeah!

15:28.968 --> 15:31.471
Save me a piece.

15:35.266 --> 15:37.143
[exhales, stunned]

15:37.143 --> 15:38.978
Our daughter...

15:39.020 --> 15:40.355
I know.

15:40.396 --> 15:42.148
Did Matt call youor anything?

15:42.190 --> 15:43.608
No. No, he didn't.

15:43.650 --> 15:46.402
Um... ahem--

15:46.444 --> 15:48.321
I'm happy for her, but--

15:48.321 --> 15:49.322
No. I know.

15:49.322 --> 15:51.366
We can't tell them now.

15:56.579 --> 15:58.247
[knocking]

15:58.289 --> 15:59.874
-Hey.-Hey!

15:59.916 --> 16:00.917
You want some help?

16:00.958 --> 16:02.752
Yeah, sure.Come in.

16:04.671 --> 16:07.507
Oh... my little girl.

16:07.507 --> 16:10.218
Getting married.

16:10.259 --> 16:11.260
Wow.

16:12.637 --> 16:14.389
"Wow" as in happy?

16:14.430 --> 16:17.016
Or... "wow" as in--

16:17.016 --> 16:18.309
Wow.[sighs]

16:18.351 --> 16:20.687
Both, maybe.

16:20.728 --> 16:23.022
I'm okay with that.

16:23.064 --> 16:26.401
I mean, Matt, he's...

16:26.442 --> 16:27.985
he seems great, you know?

16:28.027 --> 16:30.071
It's just...

16:30.113 --> 16:31.948
how long have you guysknown each other?

16:31.990 --> 16:33.241
Seven... eight months?

16:33.282 --> 16:34.534
Mom, first of all,

16:34.575 --> 16:36.035
we're not gettingmarried tomorrow.

16:36.035 --> 16:38.287
We're gonna waittill summer,

16:38.329 --> 16:39.372
after Matt graduates.

16:40.665 --> 16:44.043
Okay, so a June wedding?

16:46.587 --> 16:49.048
Do you rememberwhat you and Dad told me?

16:49.048 --> 16:50.550
How I should go for my dreams

16:50.591 --> 16:52.552
and how I coulddo anything I wanted?

16:52.593 --> 16:53.594
Yeah.

16:53.636 --> 16:54.595
Well...

16:54.637 --> 16:56.556
I did that.

16:56.556 --> 16:59.058
I'm on trackto graduate with honors,

16:59.100 --> 17:00.435
and...

17:00.476 --> 17:02.603
Matt is my future, Mom.

17:03.730 --> 17:05.147
I know it.

17:06.232 --> 17:07.275
Okay.

17:07.316 --> 17:09.234
I just needed to hear itfrom you.

17:09.234 --> 17:10.236
Just the two of us. You know?

17:10.278 --> 17:12.405
Yeah. Like allour late-night talks

17:12.446 --> 17:14.240
when I was growing up.

17:14.281 --> 17:16.159
Exactly.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.577
I couldn't have gotten throughhigh school without you.

17:19.078 --> 17:20.621
Now you're planning a wedding.

17:20.663 --> 17:22.165
We're planninga wedding!

17:22.205 --> 17:24.333
I have no ideawhere to begin.

17:25.960 --> 17:29.172
Well, you start

17:29.213 --> 17:31.466
with that crazy, wonderful loveyou're feeling right now.

17:31.507 --> 17:34.260
You hold onto it tight.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.596
And if you're lucky,

17:36.637 --> 17:38.014
that's where you'll end up.

17:38.056 --> 17:41.309
Everything I know about love...

17:41.350 --> 17:43.019
I learned from you and Daddy.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.438
[chuckles softly]

17:47.523 --> 17:49.567
[♪♪]

17:53.154 --> 17:54.781
What arewe going to do?

17:54.781 --> 17:56.824
I don't know.

17:56.866 --> 17:58.034
Nicole thinks

17:58.076 --> 18:00.703
we are the happiest coupleshe's ever met.

18:01.871 --> 18:04.457
Nearly everybody does.

18:04.457 --> 18:06.626
John?

18:06.667 --> 18:08.503
Can you do one last thingfor me,

18:08.544 --> 18:10.505
beforewe end this?

18:10.546 --> 18:13.216
Can we wait to tell themuntil after the wedding?

18:13.257 --> 18:14.842
[sighing] Abby...

18:14.884 --> 18:16.636
It's gonna ruin her wedding.

18:16.636 --> 18:17.804
I can't do it.

18:17.804 --> 18:19.222
Maybethey should know.

18:19.263 --> 18:20.807
Go into their weddingwith their eyes wide open.

18:20.848 --> 18:22.350
Don't say that.

18:22.391 --> 18:24.310
Just becausewe can't make it work

18:24.352 --> 18:25.645
doesn't meanI want our daughter

18:25.686 --> 18:27.647
to have a jaded viewof marriage.

18:27.688 --> 18:29.649
How can we fake itfor six more months?

18:29.690 --> 18:31.651
We've lived our whole lifefor those kids.

18:31.692 --> 18:33.194
We can do this.

18:34.445 --> 18:35.696
They'll figure it out.

18:35.738 --> 18:38.449
Okay, soit won't be easy.

18:40.117 --> 18:42.119
[exhales wearily]

18:45.581 --> 18:48.835
I guess...we can try.

18:50.253 --> 18:53.881
But if things between us,if they get too bad,

18:53.923 --> 18:55.258
we have to tell them.

18:56.425 --> 18:58.135
Okay.

19:00.638 --> 19:03.141
So... June?

19:05.852 --> 19:07.937
Yeah. June.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.528
Listen, I-I could unpack

19:15.528 --> 19:16.737
and you could turn intoa nine-year-old again.

19:17.822 --> 19:19.282
Dad...

19:20.992 --> 19:22.577
Next time you see me,

19:22.618 --> 19:24.370
it will be six weeksbefore the wedding.

19:24.370 --> 19:26.289
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.This was a great vacation.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.291
You can call us"John" and "Abby" by now.

19:28.332 --> 19:29.709
John.

19:29.709 --> 19:31.377
Oh. No. "Mr. Reynolds."

19:31.419 --> 19:32.587
You're right.

19:32.628 --> 19:34.380
I'm just kidding!I'm kidding.

19:34.422 --> 19:36.716
I think there will bea lot of phone calls.

19:36.757 --> 19:37.925
Lots!

19:37.967 --> 19:39.594
Nothing but school worktill June.

19:39.635 --> 19:40.761

Okay.

19:48.895 --> 19:50.771
Bye.

19:52.857 --> 19:54.817
Bye!

19:59.780 --> 20:02.658
[♪♪]

20:15.463 --> 20:17.757
[♪♪]

20:31.604 --> 20:32.855
[Pastor]:There's the beautiful bride!

20:32.897 --> 20:33.940
Oh, Pastor Mike!

20:33.940 --> 20:35.524
I'm so glad you'redoing our wedding.

20:35.566 --> 20:36.651
Are you kidding?I wouldn't miss it.

20:36.692 --> 20:37.652
You must be Matt.

20:37.693 --> 20:39.528
Pastor, thank youfor meeting with us.

20:39.570 --> 20:40.529
Call me Mike.Please.

20:40.571 --> 20:42.573
Let's sit.

20:44.408 --> 20:47.995
I want to know all about you.Tell me how you two met.

20:48.037 --> 20:50.456
College chorus,last year.

20:50.456 --> 20:53.459
Matt couldn't sing a note,but needed art credits.

20:53.501 --> 20:56.295
He even tried outfor a solo.

20:56.295 --> 20:57.505
He was awful!

20:57.546 --> 20:58.839
[laughing]But adorable.

20:58.881 --> 21:00.633
[Matt]: Why elsewould a tone-deaf guy like me

21:00.675 --> 21:01.801
join the choir?

21:01.801 --> 21:03.135
[Nicole laughs]

21:03.135 --> 21:04.178
Except...

21:04.220 --> 21:05.471
to get the most beautifulgirl in the world

21:05.471 --> 21:06.430
to notice me.

21:06.472 --> 21:08.474
That's veryromantic, Matt.

21:08.474 --> 21:09.809
Which is whywe're here, right?

21:09.809 --> 21:11.811
To talk about what happenswhen the romance wears thin?

21:11.852 --> 21:12.937
Daddy!

21:12.979 --> 21:14.480
[Pastor Mike]:Actually, he's not wrong.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.232
Romance does fade.

21:16.273 --> 21:19.860
That's why marriage is basedon commitment and not feelings.

21:19.902 --> 21:22.321
John, maybe you and Abbycould tell us

21:22.363 --> 21:24.240
how you've managed to keepyour commitment so fresh

21:24.281 --> 21:25.282
all these years.

21:27.410 --> 21:29.745
Well, three monthsafter we first married,

21:29.787 --> 21:31.539
your mother and Ihad a terrible fight.

21:31.580 --> 21:36.127
It got so bad,that she left the house,

21:36.168 --> 21:38.170
and she was gone so long,I was sure she left me.

21:38.170 --> 21:39.547
Well, what did you do?

21:39.588 --> 21:42.174
He made the worst browniesin the history of the world.

21:42.174 --> 21:43.718
[laughs]

21:43.759 --> 21:46.887
If something can be rawand burnt at the same time...

21:46.929 --> 21:48.514
But, after that, we just, uh,

21:48.556 --> 21:51.517
we sat downat the kitchen table

21:51.517 --> 21:53.561
and we talked.

21:53.602 --> 21:54.729
Yeah, we talked about how

21:54.770 --> 21:56.856
we had to give each otherthe benefit of the doubt

21:56.897 --> 21:58.482
and operate from kindness.

21:58.524 --> 21:59.692
And faith in each other.

21:59.692 --> 22:00.735
Oh! And dancing.

22:00.776 --> 22:01.777
You told me that, Mom.

22:03.654 --> 22:05.364
"Never stop dancing."Right?

22:05.406 --> 22:06.741
Yeah.

22:06.782 --> 22:07.908
That's great.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.201
Let me walk youthrough the ceremony.

22:09.201 --> 22:10.661
[Nicole]: Yeah.

22:14.081 --> 22:16.083
Hey, um, I'll makedinner tonight.

22:16.125 --> 22:17.585
You go relax, okay?

22:17.626 --> 22:19.879
With Dad at school,just-just go hang out.

22:19.879 --> 22:21.088
Are you sure?

22:21.130 --> 22:23.340
Yeah. You've doneso much already.

22:23.382 --> 22:24.383
Okay. Go on.

22:24.383 --> 22:25.384
Okay.

22:25.426 --> 22:27.470
Take a load off.Love you.

22:29.847 --> 22:31.932
[exhales heavily]

22:35.770 --> 22:38.397
[♪♪]

22:49.116 --> 22:50.826
[sighs]

22:56.123 --> 22:57.458
How did I end up

22:57.500 --> 22:59.085
with Martha Stewartas a defensive coordinator?

22:59.126 --> 23:01.670
Don't knock it.

23:01.712 --> 23:03.798
I'm saving youa ton of dough here, man.

23:03.839 --> 23:07.093
Do you have any idea how mucha good seamstress charges?

23:07.134 --> 23:09.762
I can't say that I do, no.

23:09.804 --> 23:13.641
Well, zigzag stitchingdoes not come cheap.

23:13.682 --> 23:15.434
How'd the churchmeeting go?

23:15.476 --> 23:18.813
Uh, you knowhow everyone says

23:18.854 --> 23:20.439
I'm so calm all the time?

23:20.439 --> 23:21.982
"Ice Man."

23:22.024 --> 23:24.985
No better coachwhen the game's on the line.

23:25.027 --> 23:27.488
Yeah, well, "Ice Man"nearly had a meltdown.

23:27.530 --> 23:29.824
Ooh. [exhales]

23:29.865 --> 23:31.158
Not surprised.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.495
Like, you lose a game,people hate you for a week.

23:34.537 --> 23:36.997
But, uh, daughter's wedding?

23:37.039 --> 23:38.791
Mess that up and...

23:38.833 --> 23:40.668
well, uh,you get the picture, right?

23:40.709 --> 23:43.462
Thanks.I feel so much better.

23:43.462 --> 23:44.463
Good talk, Sol.

23:44.463 --> 23:47.633
Any time, buddy.

23:47.633 --> 23:49.635
Laundry time.

23:49.635 --> 23:52.179
You will make somebodya fine wife someday, Sol.

23:52.221 --> 23:53.305
[Sol]: Hey, Charlene.

23:53.347 --> 23:55.850
Well, hey, heads up--he's a little twitchy.

23:55.891 --> 23:57.977
[whispers]:Wedding jitters.

24:00.604 --> 24:02.481
Let me guess--

24:02.481 --> 24:04.650
you can't standyour future son-in-law?

24:04.650 --> 24:07.069
Uh, no, actually,he's, uh, he's a nice kid.

24:07.111 --> 24:09.029
He'll makea great husband for Nicole.

24:09.071 --> 24:11.866
Money?I mean, weddings can becrazy.

24:11.907 --> 24:13.868
True. I always thought

24:13.909 --> 24:15.494
if I spent half my salaryon something,

24:15.536 --> 24:17.830
it would be a bass boat...

24:19.540 --> 24:21.625
But no, that's--that's not it,

24:21.667 --> 24:23.794
and I really can'ttalk about it.

24:24.962 --> 24:26.088
Are you sure?

24:26.130 --> 24:28.048
I'm happy to bethe sounding board,

24:28.090 --> 24:29.508
like always.

24:29.550 --> 24:30.885
There's justsome personal stuff

24:30.926 --> 24:33.429
going on at home.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.055
I need your input

24:35.097 --> 24:37.683
on some of thesestudent council applications.

24:37.683 --> 24:39.518
Some of them put you downas a reference.

24:39.518 --> 24:42.104
Uh, yeah.I'll take a look.

24:44.231 --> 24:46.150
Oh, and I have a new number,

24:46.192 --> 24:48.027
so I will text itto you later,

24:48.068 --> 24:49.737

24:49.778 --> 24:51.030
Okay. Thanks.

24:51.030 --> 24:54.617
Okay. [laughs]

25:01.290 --> 25:03.959
[♪♪]

25:12.051 --> 25:13.219
[laughter and chatter,overlapping]

25:13.219 --> 25:16.847
Those tulips are coming up,aren't they?

25:16.889 --> 25:18.098
Guys, that was great.

25:18.140 --> 25:19.767
You know, Nicolealways talks about

25:19.808 --> 25:21.143
these family dinnersby the lake.

25:21.185 --> 25:22.937
Yeah, we've had a lotof good times out here.

25:22.978 --> 25:25.314
Anniversaries,birthdays.

25:26.899 --> 25:27.983
And now this.

25:28.025 --> 25:29.610
But this isthe first time

25:29.652 --> 25:31.612
we've ever welcomedan in-law.

25:31.654 --> 25:32.780
Cheersto the new guy.

25:32.821 --> 25:33.781
New guy.

25:33.822 --> 25:34.782
To the new guy!

25:34.823 --> 25:37.076
[glasses clinking]

25:37.117 --> 25:38.536
Welcome.

25:38.577 --> 25:39.995
Oh, Mom and Dadeven got engaged

25:40.037 --> 25:41.914
out here on the dock.

25:41.914 --> 25:43.123
Go on, Dad. Tell him.

25:43.165 --> 25:45.626
Oh, that was a long time ago,

25:45.668 --> 25:47.294
back when it wasjust an old fishing dock.

25:47.336 --> 25:48.754
A lot's changed since then.

25:48.796 --> 25:50.839
Matt, tell usabout your parents.

25:50.881 --> 25:52.174
They must beso excited.

25:52.216 --> 25:53.592
Well, they can't believe

25:53.634 --> 25:55.010
I'm marrying the daughteroftheJohn Reynolds.

25:55.052 --> 25:56.804
They used to watchyour football games

25:56.845 --> 25:57.930
on TV all the time.

25:57.972 --> 26:00.516
I mean, this is, like,way before I was born.

26:00.557 --> 26:02.017
[groans] Oh! Wow.

26:02.059 --> 26:04.186
And you were doing so welluntil then.

26:04.228 --> 26:05.312
I'm sorry.

26:05.354 --> 26:07.565
Actually, my mom evenremembers you in the stands.

26:07.606 --> 26:08.607
Ahh!

26:08.649 --> 26:10.943
Like John said,that was a long time ago.

26:10.985 --> 26:12.987
Who wants dessert?

26:13.028 --> 26:14.154
Oh! Me, please.

26:14.196 --> 26:15.197
Yes!

26:15.239 --> 26:17.366
[Kade]: Thanks, Mom.

26:27.084 --> 26:29.211
Ah, there she is. Hey.

26:30.587 --> 26:31.630
Hey.

26:31.630 --> 26:32.631
Everything okay?

26:32.631 --> 26:33.632
Of course,why wouldn't it be?

26:33.674 --> 26:35.134
Well, you just...

26:35.175 --> 26:37.011
well, you seemeda little sensitive

26:37.052 --> 26:39.805
to all that talkabout you and John.

26:39.805 --> 26:41.056
[forced chuckle]

26:41.098 --> 26:43.350
It's not about us, it's a partyfor Matt and Nicole.

26:43.392 --> 26:45.019
Right, right.

26:45.060 --> 26:47.646
The fact thatyou and John

26:47.688 --> 26:51.150
have been sleeping inseparate beds for six months?

26:51.150 --> 26:52.651
That's ridiculous.

26:52.651 --> 26:54.153
Sweetheart,I might be getting old,

26:54.153 --> 26:55.696
but I'm not stupid.

26:55.738 --> 26:57.823
It's just a rough patch.

26:57.865 --> 26:59.825
Every marriage has them.It's no big deal.

26:59.867 --> 27:01.869
A rough patch is one thing,

27:01.910 --> 27:03.329
but when two peoplestart leading separate lives--

27:03.329 --> 27:05.914
Dad! Seriously.

27:05.956 --> 27:07.958
It's okay.

27:09.084 --> 27:11.837
Okay.

27:32.316 --> 27:35.110
[weary sigh] I don't knowwhy I waited this long.

27:35.152 --> 27:36.362
Yeah, why did youwait so long?

27:36.403 --> 27:37.488
Well,

27:37.529 --> 27:39.198
there weren't any good boutiquesnear the school,

27:39.198 --> 27:41.116
and I wantedto do it with you,

27:41.158 --> 27:44.119
but six weeks out,no dress...

27:44.161 --> 27:45.871
We'll find it.

27:45.913 --> 27:49.375
There are 300,000for us to choose from here.

27:49.416 --> 27:50.751
Which meanswe'll find my dress

27:50.793 --> 27:51.877
after the wedding.

27:51.919 --> 27:52.920
Perfect.

27:52.961 --> 27:54.213
You could always go in...

27:54.254 --> 27:56.298
this direction.

27:58.175 --> 27:59.760
Thank you, Aunt Beth,but I think I'll pass.

27:59.802 --> 28:01.887
You wantcap sleeves, right?

28:01.929 --> 28:03.639
Okay, so let's juststart with that.

28:03.681 --> 28:04.598
We'll narrow it down.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.641
Wait. Mom!

28:05.682 --> 28:06.892
Yeah?

28:06.892 --> 28:08.143
I know. Why don't Iuse your wedding dress?

28:08.185 --> 28:10.396
It's beautifuland vintage,

28:10.396 --> 28:11.897
and available.

28:11.939 --> 28:13.232
No, it's all frayed.

28:13.232 --> 28:15.067
I don't even know where it is.

28:15.067 --> 28:16.360
But it's lucky?

28:16.402 --> 28:19.071
There has to be something here.Let's all take a rack.

28:19.113 --> 28:21.782
[phone buzzing]

28:21.824 --> 28:23.784
The caterer!

28:23.826 --> 28:27.079
I forgot I'm supposed tobe there in 15 minutes.

28:28.872 --> 28:30.249
I-I guess we'll try againtomorrow.

28:30.249 --> 28:31.917
Okay.

28:31.917 --> 28:33.168
Okay. Thanks, Mom.Love you.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.211
-Love you.-Thanks, Aunt Beth.

28:38.006 --> 28:41.135
These wedding boutiquesare going to kill me.

28:41.176 --> 28:43.762
If I hearone more "muzak" version

28:43.804 --> 28:45.305
of Pachelbel's "Canon"

28:45.347 --> 28:47.433
while I look at tulleand lace...

28:51.103 --> 28:52.104
Abby, what's going on?

28:52.146 --> 28:54.481
Nothing.

28:58.902 --> 29:00.904
I'm not supposedto talk about it.

29:01.905 --> 29:04.116
Let's just say...

29:04.158 --> 29:06.785
John and Ihave seen better days.

29:06.827 --> 29:09.288
Well, you've been marriedfor over 20 years.

29:09.329 --> 29:10.914
You're due for a dip.

29:10.956 --> 29:13.709
It's more than a dip.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.127
We talked to a lawyer.

29:15.127 --> 29:16.837
What?

29:16.879 --> 29:18.130
How come you didn't tell me?

29:18.172 --> 29:21.341
We wanted to keep it a secretuntil after the wedding.

29:21.383 --> 29:24.970
We decided, uh...a while ago,

29:25.012 --> 29:26.305
in December.

29:26.305 --> 29:28.056
No.

29:28.098 --> 29:29.349
No. No, no.

29:29.391 --> 29:32.895
Maybe I just need to gobe on my own for a while.

29:32.936 --> 29:35.814
Maybe I'm supposed to go

29:35.856 --> 29:39.860
and be that travel writerthat I always wanted to be.

29:40.903 --> 29:42.362
Maybe giving up on that dream

29:42.404 --> 29:45.324
is something that startedthis whole process.

29:46.366 --> 29:47.367
Do you think?

29:47.409 --> 29:49.119
Do you remember the plan?

29:49.161 --> 29:50.287
The plan was

29:50.329 --> 29:52.372
that I would be there for himduring the season,

29:52.414 --> 29:53.999
and he would be there for meoff-season.

29:54.041 --> 29:56.001
Well, maybe now,with the kids gone,

29:56.043 --> 29:58.045
you can reclaim that dreamtogether?

29:58.086 --> 29:59.171
How?

29:59.171 --> 30:00.339
A tripdown memory lane.

30:00.380 --> 30:02.382
Remind yourselveswhat you built.

30:02.424 --> 30:05.761
I don't knowhow to do that, Beth.

30:05.803 --> 30:07.721
I do.

30:07.763 --> 30:10.557
Sometimes, a picture reallyis worth a thousand words,

30:10.599 --> 30:12.935
especially whenthey're pictures of your life.

30:12.976 --> 30:16.146
Or your marriage.

30:16.188 --> 30:17.815
Step one...

30:17.856 --> 30:19.274
Pick out a scrapbook.

30:19.316 --> 30:21.401
Okay.

30:22.778 --> 30:24.446

30:25.572 --> 30:29.117

31:33.098 --> 31:35.183

31:38.228 --> 31:39.938

31:39.980 --> 31:41.523
Did something happenwith you and Matt?

31:41.565 --> 31:43.483
No, no. It's nothing like that.

31:43.525 --> 31:46.153
It's just... [sniffles]I've got a million things to do.

31:46.194 --> 31:48.196
The party favors,the centerpieces...

31:48.238 --> 31:49.615
My dress!I don't have a dress!

31:49.656 --> 31:51.116
How can I help you?

31:51.116 --> 31:54.953
Um, party favors,centerpieces, my dress?

31:54.995 --> 31:56.413
Mom, I was so busyat school.

31:56.455 --> 31:58.957
I bet, if we buckle down,we can get it all done,

31:58.999 --> 32:00.876
and have timeto treat ourselves.

32:00.917 --> 32:02.628
[deep breath]

32:02.628 --> 32:05.339
Okay. Yes.

32:05.380 --> 32:07.341
Oh, thank you so much.

32:13.347 --> 32:16.099

32:16.141 --> 32:18.101

32:19.811 --> 32:22.189
[door opens]

32:22.230 --> 32:23.523
[laughing]

32:23.565 --> 32:27.027
You look likeyou've been run over by a train.

32:27.069 --> 32:30.238
Worse. I just worked outwith my future son-in-law.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.531
I saw you guys.

32:31.573 --> 32:33.158
You didn't look like you hadtoo much trouble keeping up.

32:33.158 --> 32:34.660
Oh, I don't know.

32:34.660 --> 32:36.995
He wants to bein peak shape for the wedding.

32:36.995 --> 32:38.497
I just want to be ableto brush my teeth later.

32:38.538 --> 32:41.083
Sit up. Turn around.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.043

32:43.085 --> 32:44.503
Mm-hmm.

32:47.297 --> 32:49.383
A few times.

32:49.424 --> 32:51.051
Aw, you know, I don't--I don't get it.

32:51.093 --> 32:53.720
Abby and I used to belike them...

32:53.762 --> 32:55.681

32:55.681 --> 32:57.516
[deep breath]

32:57.557 --> 32:58.684
I guesswe just stopped trying.

32:58.725 --> 33:01.603
Mm, sounds like my marriage,

33:01.645 --> 33:03.438
or what I rememberof it anyways.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.399
I guesseven the happiest couples

33:05.440 --> 33:07.275
start to take each otherfor granted.

33:07.317 --> 33:08.568
You know, rumor has it

33:08.610 --> 33:10.195

33:29.464 --> 33:30.757
We have an attorney...

33:30.799 --> 33:32.551

33:34.469 --> 33:36.096

They believedthat we could go all the way.

01:03:10.494 --> 01:03:12.829
They'd be so disappointed.

01:03:14.748 --> 01:03:17.918
[Beth]: You don't have todisappoint them, you know.

01:03:21.755 --> 01:03:23.715

Now it's your turn.

01:04:10.428 --> 01:04:12.055
What?

01:04:12.055 --> 01:04:13.932
Abby, John is trying.

01:04:13.974 --> 01:04:15.892
[groans] Dad.

01:04:15.934 --> 01:04:17.394
I've seen him.

01:04:17.435 --> 01:04:19.354
What about you?

01:04:22.023 --> 01:04:23.149
It's weird.

01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:26.778
Sometimes, we feel like"ourselves" again, but...

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.113
I don't know.

01:04:28.154 --> 01:04:30.740
The last few years...

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.954
I don't thinkwe're going to make it.

01:04:38.164 --> 01:04:40.750
How did it get so bad?

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:42.085
Do you even know?

01:04:43.753 --> 01:04:46.423

01:04:46.423 --> 01:04:49.092

01:04:50.302 --> 01:04:52.971
But I let it happen, too.

01:04:53.013 --> 01:04:54.931
I remember

01:04:54.931 --> 01:04:58.143
the month beforeyou walked down the aisle,

01:04:58.184 --> 01:05:00.937
how he brought youa dozen red roses every day.

01:05:00.937 --> 01:05:03.565
Every day, Abby!

01:05:03.607 --> 01:05:04.983
You remember?

01:05:05.025 --> 01:05:07.319
He worked all summerfor those roses.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.779
And when you werelaid up on bed-rest,

01:05:09.821 --> 01:05:11.281
pregnant with Kade?

01:05:11.281 --> 01:05:12.449
He went and got

01:05:12.449 --> 01:05:14.743

It wasso long ago.

01:05:21.541 --> 01:05:23.960
Things change.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.630
People grow apart.

01:05:26.671 --> 01:05:29.466
All you ever wanted to dowas to marry that boy.

01:05:30.842 --> 01:05:33.178
It's latein the game...

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:36.765
but there's still timeleft on the clock.

01:05:38.016 --> 01:05:40.518
You can stillchoose to stay.

Okay, what's so important?

01:07:06.896 --> 01:07:08.940
Did I win a Pulitzerfor my restaurant review?

01:07:08.982 --> 01:07:09.941

Stan was kind enoughto forward me a few... dozen.

01:07:24.247 --> 01:07:26.458
You thoughtI threw them away.

01:07:26.499 --> 01:07:28.460

I'd like to offer youa trial spot in my papers.

01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:34.549
If it goes well,

01:07:34.591 --> 01:07:36.634
it could lead to a columnof your own in syndication.

01:07:36.676 --> 01:07:38.553
Can you join usfor a few minutes?

01:07:38.595 --> 01:07:41.139

You've always beenmy ace reporter.

I'd offer you somecheese and crackers,

01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:45.328
but I gave it to the ducksabout an hour ago.

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:48.206
Seemed only right,since they were here on time.

01:08:48.247 --> 01:08:50.041
Well, I'm here now,

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:51.542
so we can still do this.

01:08:51.584 --> 01:08:53.461
Why?

01:08:53.502 --> 01:08:56.339
Why?

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.520
You know, maybewe're just fooling ourselves.

Don't you even

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.189
want to ask mewhy I was late?

01:09:14.232 --> 01:09:16.359
Does it matter?

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:17.569
Maybe it does to me.

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:19.112
I'm putting myself out there.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.572
I sent you the license plate--

I got completely clear

01:09:37.714 --> 01:09:39.381
about howwe're fooling ourselves.

01:09:40.591 --> 01:09:41.885
I'm gonna sleepin the guest room.
