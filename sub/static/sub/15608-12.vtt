00:05.960 --> 00:07.040
Welcome to lunch.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.580
Today's theme
is surf and turf.

00:09.580 --> 00:11.000
Bon appetite!

00:11.540 --> 00:14.580
Mmm, ceviche.

00:14.580 --> 00:18.290
Wait, why is there
a little treasure chest
in here?

00:18.290 --> 00:20.620
Oh, I must have
scooped it up by accident

00:20.620 --> 00:21.960
when I was grabbing
the goldfish.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.290
Ew!
My goats wouldn't
even eat this stuff,

00:26.290 --> 00:29.330
and they once ate
our septic tank.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.920
Okay, okay,
so guys you're not fans
of the "surf."

00:31.920 --> 00:34.750
Perhaps you'll find
the "turf" acceptable.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.120
There ya go.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.380
Some nice, healthy greens
harvested fresh

00:38.380 --> 00:41.120
from the Camp
Champion football field.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.960
Murphy, you can't
seriously expect us
to eat that.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.250
That's the 50 yard line!

00:45.250 --> 00:47.250

of the field!

00:48.330 --> 00:50.250
Listen, I'm doing my best.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.250
So, quit givin' me carp!

00:52.880 --> 00:54.330
If we had carp
we'd be eating it!

00:55.330 --> 00:56.540
Fine.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.620
You hotshots think
you can do better than me,

00:58.620 --> 01:01.290
then you can make dinner
for the campers tonight.

01:01.290 --> 01:05.040
I think we can,
and we will.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.420
Finally, we'll have
a decent meal around here.

01:07.420 --> 01:09.250
We'll see.

01:09.250 --> 01:12.880
Oh! And since you guys
aren't eating the turf,
I'll help myself.

We finally get to make
a good dinner!

02:20.210 --> 02:22.080
Can I get a E-I-E-I-Oh, yeah!

02:23.120 --> 02:25.170
And a rousing huzzah!

02:25.170 --> 02:27.210
When you have
an E-I-E-I-Oh, yeah,

02:27.210 --> 02:29.040
you really don't need
a huzzah.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.250
But four cooks in the kitchen
might be like...

02:33.250 --> 02:34.830
Like...

02:34.830 --> 02:37.120
What's the phrase
when there are too many
cooks in the kitchen?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.380
Too many cooks
in the kitchen?

02:38.380 --> 02:39.540
No...

02:41.670 --> 02:44.880
Well, I think the Grizzlies
should be in charge.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.170
The only thing
you've ever been
in charge of

02:46.170 --> 02:47.420
is the reptile club.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.960
And that's because
you were the only member.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.290
That is not true.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.380
Mrs. Kipling doesn't count.

02:54.210 --> 02:56.330
Well, it just so happens,
in middle school,

02:56.330 --> 02:57.710
I cooked for myself
every day.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.040
That's because
you kept getting
your lunch money stolen.

03:00.040 --> 03:04.210
And I am still waiting
for Zuri to apologize.

03:04.210 --> 03:06.580
Well, I think the Woodchucks
should be in charge.

03:06.580 --> 03:09.080
I once made dinner
for one hundred.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.920
Were they cows, Lou?

03:10.920 --> 03:11.920
No...

03:13.000 --> 03:14.170
They were goats.

03:15.670 --> 03:16.790
Hey, Jorge,

03:16.790 --> 03:18.420
what's funnier than
a bunch of fools

03:18.420 --> 03:20.120
trying to cook dinner?

03:20.120 --> 03:21.120
Prop comedy?

03:22.330 --> 03:25.620
I have to stop
asking you questions.

03:25.620 --> 03:29.120
No, a video
about a bunch of fools
trying to cook dinner.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.420
I bet it'll go viral.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.670
Hey, friends, family...

03:35.170 --> 03:37.120
Xander.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.290
Since you guys can't agree
on who should prepare
dinner tonight,

03:40.290 --> 03:42.040
why don't you
have a competition?

03:42.040 --> 03:43.250
Like that show, Chopped?

03:43.250 --> 03:45.790
Oooh, I love that show!
I talk about it all the time.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.580
Right, Xander?
All.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.120
The. Time.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.500
So let's do it.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.210
It'll be Woodchucks
versus Grizzlies!

03:54.210 --> 03:57.040

03:57.040 --> 03:58.040
(LAUGHS)

03:58.580 --> 03:59.710
It worked!

03:59.710 --> 04:01.830
Four angry teenagers in a room

04:01.830 --> 04:05.000
where everything is
either sharp, hot, or greasy?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
That's gonna be
total click bait!

04:08.000 --> 04:11.420
The Woodchucks
are going to be humiliated
on the Internet!

04:11.420 --> 04:14.250
Big talk from a guy
who went viral
by being chased up a tree.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.040
That dog was vicious!
It was an elderly Chihuahua.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.250
Two teams.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.620
Two crates
of mystery ingredients.

04:27.620 --> 04:28.790
Two hosts.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.000
I'm Zuri Ross.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.380
And I'm...
Not important.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.290
Welcome to Diced!

04:34.290 --> 04:37.580
And I'm...
Time to meet
the "celebrity" judge!

04:39.620 --> 04:42.540
He's a 15-year vet
of the Camp Kikiwaka kitchen

04:42.540 --> 04:45.420
and the inventor
of rat-dropping-atouille...

04:45.420 --> 04:46.750
Murphy!

04:46.750 --> 04:49.460
The secret is using
only the freshest
of droppings.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.250
Sometimes you gotta
follow 'em around for days.

04:52.580 --> 04:53.750
You should have
kept that a secret.

04:55.170 --> 04:58.750
And I'm...
Time to meet our two teams!

04:58.750 --> 05:00.170
Howdy!

05:00.170 --> 05:03.290
This is Lou Hockhauser,
whose favorite dish is goat.

05:03.290 --> 05:06.580
What?
Excuse me,
favorite friend is a goat.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.210
Which made for
an interesting prom.

05:11.830 --> 05:14.670
And Lou's teammate
is Emma Ross!

05:14.670 --> 05:16.250
Hi.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.920
And she'll never need to cook,
because she's pretty and rich.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.080
That's true.

05:21.250 --> 05:24.330
And I'm...
Let's meet the Grizzlies!

05:24.330 --> 05:27.620
Ravi Ross
is a socially awkward
science geek,

05:27.620 --> 05:30.330
whose favorite game
is solitaire.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.750
And I am undefeated.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.880
I am also available, ladies.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.290
That's a shocker.

05:39.290 --> 05:43.120
And Ravi's teammate
is Xander McCormick!

05:43.120 --> 05:44.710
Who is dating Emma.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.420
That's right.
I know.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.040
We can't believe it either.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.960
Now that we've met our teams,

05:51.960 --> 05:54.250
time to find out
what they'll be cooking with.

05:55.210 --> 05:56.710
Chefs,

05:56.710 --> 05:58.710
crack open those crates!

06:00.250 --> 06:01.120
Ew!

06:01.120 --> 06:02.460
What the heck is in there?

06:02.460 --> 06:05.120
Don't puke, Lou.
Swallow it back.

06:06.330 --> 06:08.710
I guess this is
not going to be as easy
as they thought.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.210
And I'm Jorge Ramir...

06:17.040 --> 06:19.170
Welcome back to Diced.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.830
Our contestants just found out
their secret ingredients.

06:22.830 --> 06:24.420
Bruised tomatoes,

06:25.710 --> 06:27.330
moldy gray meat,

06:28.330 --> 06:30.580
ugh, some kind
of deformed fish...

06:33.120 --> 06:34.420
Shrimp tails,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.210
black bananas?

06:39.210 --> 06:41.080
Murphy, is this

06:41.080 --> 06:42.120
a hoof?

06:43.250 --> 06:44.920
Oh, yeah,
I would've gotten you more,

06:44.920 --> 06:47.120
but that's all I could pry
off the grill
of my scooter.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.330
When I first saw
those ingredients,

06:50.330 --> 06:52.210
it reminded me
of growing up on a farm.

06:52.210 --> 06:53.460
We didn't have a lot of money,

06:53.460 --> 06:55.670
so we had to get
pretty creative
in the kitchen.

06:55.670 --> 06:57.710
When I first saw
those ingredients,
I thought,

06:57.710 --> 07:00.330
is it possible
to throw up food
you haven't even eaten yet?

07:02.330 --> 07:04.170
My mom was a great cook.

07:04.170 --> 07:06.920
I remember every night
her food would bring
my dad to tears.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.500
He loved it so much,
he shared most of his food
with our dog.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.620
Wait a minute...

07:11.880 --> 07:13.580
I just want a video
on the Internet

07:13.580 --> 07:16.790
where I am not being chased
up a tree by a tiny dog
named Shivers.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.960
Okay, folks,
four hours until dinner.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.540
Enough with the looking,
let's start cooking!

07:24.540 --> 07:26.330
Oh, at least
there's sausage!

07:26.330 --> 07:28.040
(HISSES)
(SCRAMS) Snake!

07:29.620 --> 07:31.290
You may wanna go get that.

07:31.290 --> 07:32.330
It was your main course.

07:34.290 --> 07:38.290
So, Xander,
what's going to be
your cooking strategy?

07:38.290 --> 07:40.120
To cheer on Ravi,

07:40.120 --> 07:42.960
because the one time
I tried to make boiled eggs,
I forgot to put in the eggs.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.830
So, I basically just made
boiled water.

07:45.830 --> 07:49.210
That is when I realized
I would have to cook
twice as hard.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.880
And to win,
I would have to call
on my true love.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.210
Science.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.080
Ah, my beloved science,

07:55.080 --> 07:58.920
your warm embrace gives me
companionship on those cold,
dark nights.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.290
I am so lonely.

08:01.290 --> 08:03.380
To win this contest,

08:03.380 --> 08:05.670
I will alter
the chemical compound

08:05.670 --> 08:08.170
within the molecules
of the food using

08:08.170 --> 08:09.710
molecular gastronomy!

08:09.710 --> 08:11.210
Great idea!

08:11.210 --> 08:14.040
You have no idea
what he's talking about,
do you?

08:14.040 --> 08:15.750
Never do.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.580
So, girls,
what's your game plan

08:18.580 --> 08:20.040
for your meal plan?

08:20.040 --> 08:21.880
Ooh, let's do beef wellington!

08:21.880 --> 08:23.710
I'd be mighty impressed
if you could make that

08:23.710 --> 08:26.210
out of gray meat, hooves,

08:26.210 --> 08:28.120
and a fish that looks
like it has toes.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.210
Oh, I don't know
how to cook it.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.330
I just know how to order it.

08:32.330 --> 08:34.120
Uh-oh, Lou,

08:34.120 --> 08:37.380
looks like
your partner's skills
are limited to opening a menu

08:37.380 --> 08:39.080
and making a phone call.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.290
Oh, I don't call.

08:41.290 --> 08:43.170
There's an app.

08:43.170 --> 08:46.380
Emma, if you can't cook,
why would you want to be
in a cooking competition?

08:46.380 --> 08:48.170
Oh, I just like
being on camera.

08:49.420 --> 08:50.920
Besides, I can help spruce up
the mess hall

08:50.920 --> 08:53.080
to make it look
like a five-star restaurant.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.880
Ambiance is everything.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.920
Or as the French say,
ambiance.

09:00.830 --> 09:03.330
Ooh! This is getting good.

09:03.330 --> 09:05.920
Will Lou freak out
about not having a menu yet?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
Will the pressure
get to her?

09:07.920 --> 09:09.040
Are you gonna crack, Lou?

09:09.040 --> 09:10.330
Crack, crack, crack!

09:12.250 --> 09:15.500
Zuri, enough
with the questions, okay?
Stop grilling us.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.670
That's when it hit me!

09:18.670 --> 09:22.040
Anything tastes good
charred and slathered
in my special barbecue sauce.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.500
Just ask our old barn owl.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.120
Well, you can't,
'cause we ate her.

09:28.920 --> 09:33.540
With only three hours left,
our teams continue to prep.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.960
So, Ravi, why don't you
explain to us
what you're doing?

09:36.960 --> 09:40.170
Gladly! Using a chemical
process known as
spherification, I am...

09:40.170 --> 09:41.170
Sorry I asked.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.330
What he's doing
is getting ready to lose!

09:45.330 --> 09:48.170
He's going down
like a bad souffle.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.290
Or as the French say...

09:50.290 --> 09:51.500
Souffle.

09:53.330 --> 09:56.040
Let's check in
with our "celebrity" judge.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.120
(SNORING)

09:57.120 --> 10:00.120
So, Murphy...
(GASPS)

10:00.120 --> 10:02.250
First the kids
insult your cooking,

10:02.250 --> 10:05.120
and now you find yourself
judging theirs.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.540
Tell us what's on your mind.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.120
I think those chefs
are a bunch of spoiled,

10:09.120 --> 10:12.540
ungrateful,
snot-nosed sons of billfish.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.330
I just enjoy
hanging out with the kids.

10:15.670 --> 10:16.960
Why is everything so fancy?

10:16.960 --> 10:19.380
I am creating
a high-end dining experience.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.250
Big mistake!
Kids don't like
that fancy stuff.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.170
I'm not surprised to hear
you say that,

10:24.170 --> 10:27.880
considering every restaurant
you've ever taken me to
has the word "shack" in it.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.920
I believe you're forgetting
our date at the Burger Barn.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.380
I wish I could.

10:32.380 --> 10:36.120
The best-tasting thing
was the toy that came
with my meal.

10:36.120 --> 10:41.330
Ooh, looks like
things are heating up,
and the stove's not even on.

10:43.540 --> 10:45.120
Welcome to the fun zone!

10:45.120 --> 10:47.080
So, Emma, what do you think?

10:47.080 --> 10:50.580
Because Xander's my boyfriend,
and I really care
about his feelings,

10:50.580 --> 10:52.790
I thought it'd be best
to sugar coat things.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.210
I hate it.

10:56.290 --> 10:59.040
Burn!
And the stove's still not on!

11:01.210 --> 11:03.330
You think
your side is better?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.250
Kids don't need
three different knives!

11:05.250 --> 11:06.710
They're all necessary!

11:06.710 --> 11:08.120
There's the butter knife,
the steak knife,

11:08.120 --> 11:10.250
and a "just in case
you dropped your other knives"
knife!

11:12.580 --> 11:17.330
Well, flip my lid!
Emma, I love what you've done
with the place.

11:17.330 --> 11:19.580
The sawdust is a nice touch!

11:22.040 --> 11:24.920
Actually,
that's my nice touch.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.790
This is the Grizzly side.

11:26.790 --> 11:30.380
Wow, Xander!
You have created
quite the elegant milieu.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.250
Ooh, is this
a "dropped your knife" knife?

11:33.420 --> 11:35.880
Actually, this is my milieu.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.500
Or, as the French say...
That is French!

11:40.170 --> 11:42.290
No, Ravi, for our side
I'm decorating with sawdust.

11:42.290 --> 11:44.540
It's festive
and it soaks up vomit!

11:45.580 --> 11:47.210
Oh, dear.

11:47.210 --> 11:50.460
Xander, this is all wrong.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.750
Perhaps you could make it
a tad more highbrow.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.290
Dude, I'm not changing
my eyebrows!

11:56.000 --> 11:57.710
Emma, you know with barbecue,

11:57.710 --> 12:01.540
you don't have cloth napkins,
you have paper towels
or wet wipes.

12:01.540 --> 12:02.920
Ew!

12:02.920 --> 12:04.460
Why don't we just wipe
our mouths with diapers?

12:04.460 --> 12:07.380
Whoa, look who's too fancy
to have diapers
on the dinner table.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.960
Xander, too bad
you and I aren't
on the same team.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.750
Too bad Ravi and I
aren't on the same team.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.250
I bet nobody's ever said that.
(LAUGHS)

12:17.040 --> 12:18.790
Ever.

12:18.790 --> 12:21.170
Despite that rather
gratuitous slam,

12:21.880 --> 12:23.290
Emma and I should team up.

12:23.290 --> 12:26.880
Her decor matches
the sophistication
of my haute cuisine.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.120
If haute cuisine means
three too many knives,

12:29.120 --> 12:30.920
then you two
will be perfect together.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.170
Oh, snap peas!

12:34.170 --> 12:37.080
This show just took a twist!

12:37.080 --> 12:40.080
Murphy,
would switching partners
be against the rules?

12:40.080 --> 12:41.080
Don't care.

12:42.210 --> 12:45.290
Then let's do it!
Counselors versus CIT!

12:45.290 --> 12:48.330
Are the Rosses
ready to face their bosses?

12:48.330 --> 12:50.040
You bet!

12:50.040 --> 12:53.290
Because
when you face the Rosses,
you have already lost...

12:54.210 --> 12:56.290
Es.

12:56.290 --> 12:58.040
Who do you think
is gonna win now, Murphy?

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
Still don't care.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.120
I'm just trying to
snag those fuzzy dice.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.380
They'll look really cool
on my scooter.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.790
Nothing looks cool
on a scooter.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.420
So, Lou, how long
have you been barbequing?

13:14.420 --> 13:17.080
Heck, since I was a toddler.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.420
Little tip,
don't give a three-year-old
lighter fluid.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.040
It ends badly.

13:22.790 --> 13:24.170
Yikes!

13:24.170 --> 13:26.120
That smells like cooked feet.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.290
That's the hoof.

13:28.210 --> 13:30.170
I was gonna cook the fish,

13:30.170 --> 13:33.290
but turns out he wasn't dead
and he crawled away
when I wasn't looking.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.250
EMMA: Ravi!

13:38.250 --> 13:40.250
What are you serving?
I need to memorize
the specials!

13:40.250 --> 13:43.540
I'm not sure special
is the right word to describe
what's going on here.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.080
Smells more like a felony.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.080
It is an elk-hoof tartare,

13:49.080 --> 13:50.250
with a snake juice reduction!

13:52.080 --> 13:53.620
Maybe we should keep that
between us.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.500
Svetlana, you can set up
over there.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.330
A violinist is my final touch.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.420
Nothing sets an elegant mood
like classical music.

14:02.420 --> 14:05.790
Great idea!
While my diners are having fun
playing games for prizes,

14:05.790 --> 14:08.960
your diners will be using
one of their many knives
to cut their ears off.

14:10.210 --> 14:11.540
Ignore him, Svetlana.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.210
Now play your heart out.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.040
(SQUIRREL SQUEAKING)

14:17.170 --> 14:19.380
No offense, Svetlana,
but that sounds terrible.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.380
(SQUIRREL SQUEAKING)

14:23.580 --> 14:26.420
Lou! What happened?
Squirrels...

14:26.420 --> 14:28.210
So many squirrels.

14:28.210 --> 14:29.960
Interesting fact.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.920
Squirrels love
barbecued hoof.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.080
(PANTING)
I saved what food I could.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.880
But I may have lost a pinky.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.080
Kinda scared to look.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.750
Can you still cook?

14:40.750 --> 14:43.330
And can you wait until after
the meal for the rabies shots?

14:43.330 --> 14:44.790
Sure.

14:44.790 --> 14:47.330
A few hundred squirrel bites
can't slow me down!

14:47.330 --> 14:48.540
I'll just be in the kitchen.

14:51.290 --> 14:54.120
(TEARING UP)
That's my partner.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.290
Meanwhile, my partner
can't even lift his ladle.

14:56.290 --> 14:59.250
Hey! It has a heavy handle!

14:59.250 --> 15:01.040
(METAL SCRAPING)

15:02.120 --> 15:04.880
Ooh,
things are coming to a boil!

15:04.880 --> 15:06.210
Who will win?

15:06.210 --> 15:07.920
Did Lou lose a pinky?

15:07.920 --> 15:09.830
Will it end up
as an appetizer?

15:10.540 --> 15:11.540
Yes!

15:13.330 --> 15:15.580
Only 998 more tickets,
and I get a kazoo!

15:19.040 --> 15:20.960
Lou, what happened?

15:20.960 --> 15:22.830
You look worse
than your food.

15:24.380 --> 15:27.920
Watch it,
or I will bean you
with that beaker.

15:27.920 --> 15:32.620
And I'm going to prove that
my barbecue banquet is better
than your fancy foam fiasco.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.500
Impressive alliteration aside,

15:34.500 --> 15:38.670
I think we will show
the internet that
your barbecue barbe-cannot.

15:38.670 --> 15:39.670
(SCOFFS)

15:41.540 --> 15:44.040
Zuri, would you please
edit that out?
Not a chance.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.120
Outta my way!

15:48.120 --> 15:49.750
(CLATTERING)
(RAVI GROANS)

15:52.170 --> 15:56.290
Looks like this
cooking contest just got ugly!

15:56.290 --> 15:57.500
ALL: (CHANTING)
Food! Food! Food!

15:57.500 --> 16:01.080
The food will be right up!
Thank you for your patience.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.120
Oww!

16:03.120 --> 16:05.620
At least butter those first
to soften them up!

16:09.040 --> 16:10.750
Thank you.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.210
ALL: (CHANTING)
We want prizes!

16:12.210 --> 16:14.790
We want prizes!
We want Prizes!

16:14.790 --> 16:16.380
I told you,
I ran out of prizes!

16:16.380 --> 16:18.290
Want some paper plates?

16:18.290 --> 16:19.880
They're recyclable!

16:21.210 --> 16:23.040
Your diners are hungry,
and mad.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.620
Why aren't they
throwing stuff at you?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.250
Ow!

16:27.120 --> 16:28.830
Thanks for the suggestion.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.540
Chef Murphy,
as our "celebrity" judge,

16:34.540 --> 16:37.170
how do you think
our young chefs are doing?

16:37.170 --> 16:41.170
Those kids are flailing
like a topsil
during a nor' Easter.

16:41.170 --> 16:44.710
I have no idea
what you just said.

16:44.710 --> 16:48.210
Hey, why do you guys
keep putting quotes
around the word celebrity?

16:48.210 --> 16:49.210
'Cause you're not a celebrity.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.120
(BANGING)
(VIOLIN PLAYING)

16:57.290 --> 16:59.830
Looks like there might be
a riot in here.

16:59.830 --> 17:02.500
Is team CIT struggling?

17:02.500 --> 17:04.290
Absolutely not.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.880
Everything
is completely under control.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.380
Ravi!
Where the heck's the food?

17:09.380 --> 17:11.170
Some kid stuck me
in the butt with a fork.

17:11.170 --> 17:12.880
We gotta get some real buns
out here!

17:12.880 --> 17:14.750
Well, I could use some help!

17:15.710 --> 17:17.620
Out of my way, beaker boy!

17:19.460 --> 17:21.250
Did you see that?

17:21.250 --> 17:23.750
And a minute ago
she tried to shove me
in the garbage disposal!

17:24.830 --> 17:26.210
I'll help you, Ravi!

17:26.210 --> 17:27.500
Ow!

17:32.500 --> 17:33.500
Okay, Chef, how can I help?

17:37.080 --> 17:40.290
Pray.
Because you are now wearing
our main course.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.290
Emma in a kitchen
is like a bull
in a china shop.

17:45.290 --> 17:47.040
Which is a real issue
in my town.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.960
Two against one is no fair!

17:49.960 --> 17:51.380
Xander, get in here!

17:52.120 --> 17:53.580
I wish I could!

17:53.580 --> 17:56.460
Ow, who bit me?

17:56.460 --> 17:59.170
Xander, stop playing
with the kids! I need help!

17:59.170 --> 18:00.120
So do I!

18:04.830 --> 18:07.670
Oh, dear,
where you attacked
by squirrels, too?

18:07.670 --> 18:10.500
I wish!
Squirrels bite less!

18:11.790 --> 18:15.040
You better hurry!
Dinner is in two minutes.

18:22.750 --> 18:26.250

Scrape dinner off your shirt
and onto the plates!

18:27.500 --> 18:29.290
This is hilarious!

18:29.290 --> 18:31.420
We're gonna get
a million views!

18:31.420 --> 18:34.880
Ravi, is it supposed to
do that?
Yes.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.380
But it is not supposed
to do that! Get me a lid!

18:38.380 --> 18:42.040
Ravi, are you trying to
make food or send
smoke signals?

18:44.210 --> 18:46.620
At least my smoke
smells delightful!

18:46.620 --> 18:49.170
Unlike whatever food
you are destroying over there!

18:49.170 --> 18:51.500
You try making meat
that was 90% mold!

18:52.380 --> 18:54.080
Xander, more pepper.
On it.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.080

19:10.290 --> 19:12.120
I'm lookin' forward to this.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.170
I've never tasted
a train wreck before.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.250
Okay, first, we have
Lou and Xander's dish.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.210
May cod help us.

19:23.210 --> 19:25.920
Okay, since the barbecue
was overrun by rodents,

19:25.920 --> 19:27.830
I decided to combine
my ingredients and make

19:27.830 --> 19:30.880
what I call,
Lou's Down Home Stew.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.170

is peeling off.

19:42.290 --> 19:44.120
Eh, needs more pepper.

Okay,

19:46.960 --> 19:48.580
now that my sight's back,

19:49.750 --> 19:52.330
let's try Ravi and Emma's
dish.

19:52.330 --> 19:55.170
My creation
is a combination of shrimp

19:55.170 --> 19:59.080
parts, accented with
ripe banana foam,
and what I hope was a tomato.

on this meal.

the campers decide.

Okay, I think
we all have to admit
our food was terrible.

So, now you see
how hard my job is.

with Gladys jumpin' outta
cabinets and grabbin' at ya!

and we're sorry.

about the Gladys thing.

this might happen, so...

While you guys
were sweatin'
like a pig on a spit,

21:18.250 --> 21:22.000
I went to town and used
my friend's kitchen
to make this.

21:24.580 --> 21:28.420
Murphy, this is amazing!

21:28.420 --> 21:30.500
Yeah, when I have enough money
to buy good ingredients,

21:30.500 --> 21:32.460
I can put together
quite the feast.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.290
But how did you afford it?

21:34.290 --> 21:37.000
I used
the camp's entire food budget
for the rest of the summer.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.750
Also paid off my scooter.
(LAUGHS)

21:40.120 --> 21:41.710
Hey, I had to get
the food here somehow.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.920
So enjoy it,

21:43.920 --> 21:48.040
'cause from here on in,
the food is going to get
even worse!

21:52.210 --> 21:54.210
ZURI:
Thanks for watching Diced.

21:54.210 --> 21:55.250
I'm Zuri Ross.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.170
And I'm...
Not important.

22:02.210 --> 22:03.960
Well, that was embarrassing.

22:03.960 --> 22:08.750
Not as embarrassing
as being chased up a tree
by an arthritic Chihuahua.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.880
And our food
was a total disaster.

22:10.880 --> 22:14.170
I've never seen
so many campers
projectile vomit at once.

22:14.170 --> 22:17.080
I told you
the sawdust would
come in handy.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.290
And the worst part is,
our video didn't
get any views.

22:20.290 --> 22:22.290
Meanwhile, Ravi's
Chihuahua video

22:22.290 --> 22:23.330
is blowing up again!

22:25.120 --> 22:27.670
So nothing good
came out of this.

22:27.670 --> 22:28.710
(SCOOTER ENGINE RUNNING)
MURPHY: Not true!

22:30.580 --> 22:33.170
Svetlana and I
are going to the Burger Barn.

22:33.170 --> 22:35.120
Come on, Svet.

22:36.250 --> 22:39.290
Oh, and, uh,
hang on tight, baby.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.620
This thing can hit 20
on the straightaways.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.210
