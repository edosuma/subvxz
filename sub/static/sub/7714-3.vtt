a huge, enormous,
massive complaint

Okay.

Jim won't sign
my expense report.

You.
Okay.

Just want to let you know
l take complaints
very seriously,

01:14.199 --> 01:16.617
so, when did
this happen?

01:16.701 --> 01:17.743
One minute ago.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.079
Okay. And how
do you feel?

No.

No.

like crying?
No.

Wait, stop writing that.
That is not true.

in a triangle choke hold

01:42.227 --> 01:44.353

down to the ground

01:44.437 --> 01:46.480
and just keep
pressing and pressing,

01:46.564 --> 01:51.318
and then flip him over
and then put him in a
hammerlock and he's gasping.

He's panting for
every last breath.

a good time to freshen up

everyone to meet

02:44.747 --> 02:46.290
in the conference room
in five minutes.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.708
And l suggest that
you bring a snack

02:47.792 --> 02:49.209
because we may be
in there for a while.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.294
Michael.
Yes.

Can l talk to you in
my office for a second?
Mmm. . .

02:52.088 --> 02:55.215
Sure.
But could l first talk
to you in my office?

02:58.094 --> 03:00.053
Can l also be a boss?

03:00.138 --> 03:01.555
Look, it doesn't
take a genius to know

03:01.639 --> 03:05.017
that any organization thrives
when it has two leaders.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.395

Thank you.
l have noticed
we've been having

03:18.990 --> 03:20.991
a lot of conference
room meetings.
Mmm-hmm.

03:21.075 --> 03:24.203
And l'm wondering
if perhaps
those are a bit. . .

03:24.287 --> 03:25.412
Disruptive.
Yes.

03:25.496 --> 03:29.958
No. l don't think they are.
l think the meetings
are very important.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.211
Okay. Maybe we
should talk specifics.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.962
Let's do.
Okay.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.882
Yesterday we had
a meeting about planets.

03:36.966 --> 03:41.762
Well, to be fair,
Jim, James. . . Jimothy.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.432
To be fair, Jimothy. . .
That sounds weird.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.600
Are you okay with
being called Jim?

03:46.684 --> 03:47.851
l am.
All right.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.186
Jim, to be fair,

03:49.270 --> 03:50.562
the conversation
wasn't about planets.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.647
Right.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.273
At first, we were
talking about

03:53.358 --> 03:55.817
introducing a line
of toilet paper.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.027
And what part
of the human body

03:57.111 --> 03:59.821
does one use
toilet paper upon?

04:00.365 --> 04:03.200
So you draw a line
from there to the
other planets,

04:03.284 --> 04:04.743
and l think
by the end,
we all learned

04:04.827 --> 04:06.578
a little bit about
how small we are.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.829
Yes, l agree.
l just feel. . .

04:07.914 --> 04:09.164
Because it's
a big universe.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.542
And we're all just little
tiny specks of dust.

04:12.627 --> 04:16.088
l just think that
maybe they're eating
large amounts of the day.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.382
You know what
eats a large amount
of the day are naps.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.676
You go to sleep,
it's light out,
you wake up, it's dark.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.596
That's the whole day.
Where did that day go?
l have no idea.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.432
You mean
on a weekend?

04:28.518 --> 04:29.601
Yes.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.396
How about this?
l think our goal should be

04:32.480 --> 04:35.232
we don't have meetings
unless they're
absolutely essential.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.985
All right. No more
meetings this week.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.737
Really?
You just agree to that?

04:40.822 --> 04:42.447
l can be very
surprising.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.622
What's going on?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.208
l need to fit into
my wedding dress.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.335
However,
l'm also pregnant.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.716

that women have to gain

05:00.800 --> 05:03.051
more than nine pounds
in a pregnancy.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.346
Look at these actresses.
Some of them lose weight.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.975
Hey, did you guys register
for wedding gifts?

05:10.059 --> 05:13.145
We did, but mostly because
people expect us to.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.691
We're also
accepting other gifts
not on the registry.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.153
However much.

05:21.237 --> 05:25.282
lt's awkward
asking people for money.
But we could really use it.

Why doesn't Crate and Barrel
let you register for
a toaster full of cash?

05:30.955 --> 05:32.622

You're not registered
for a birdhouse, are you?

05:43.551 --> 05:45.010

what was the last thing
Michael said

before l came
through the door?

need to answer that.

this, you're fired."

to not take up people's time
with meetings like these.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.707

by "these" people?

a conference room
meeting.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.420
Oh, hey, everybody,
l think that Jim
has gone insane

06:20.505 --> 06:23.006
because he thinks
that my office is
a conference room.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.049
That's not
what l meant.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.552
Listen, Jim, no offense,
but when push comes to shove,

06:27.637 --> 06:30.097
what l want
is more important
than what you want.

guys think?

to my desk now?

have a moment alone
with Michael, please?

No, no, no, no.
You don't need
to go anywhere.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.564
Anything that Jim
has to say to me,

06:39.649 --> 06:41.817
he can say in front of
these types of people.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.777
That is not what l said.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.404
And also,
l am co-manager,

06:45.488 --> 06:47.155
meaning you are not
the only manager anymore.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.573
l am also a co-manager.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.908
That is not what
Wallace told us.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.076
That's exactly what
Wallace told us.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.578
That is not the way
l heard it.

Paris or Nicole,
Heidi or L.C. ,
it's so much fun.

if l'm really
thinking about it,

07:02.004 --> 07:03.922
and answering your
question honestly,

07:04.006 --> 07:08.510
l'd have to go with L.C.
Heidi's a bad friend
and her skin is terrible.

lt is one thing
me giving you
the co-manager title,

it is another thing
you bossing me around.

l'm not bossing you around.

which is sharing your job.

just call David Wallace.

No, no, no. No!
We will not call
David Wallace.

I'm calling because

able to give out

people expect it.

However, there just
is only a small amount
of money for each branch.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.716
So, we're Ieaving
it up to the managers

07:47.800 --> 07:49.301
to decide how
to distribute it.

07:49.385 --> 07:53.430
Got it, Dave.
Sounds like your classic
big picture decision.

07:53.514 --> 07:56.266
Which will clearly affect
the day-to-day wellbeing
of our employees.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.559
It's probably
a IittIe of both.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.685
Which is it more of?

07:58.769 --> 07:59.853
Excuse me?
Hey, David,

07:59.937 --> 08:01.188
l know that l am
very new at this,

08:01.272 --> 08:03.273
but l have a very
good perspective
on how things work. . .

08:03.357 --> 08:06.651
Wait, I'm sorry.
Michael, are you
texting me?

08:08.237 --> 08:10.322
l thought
maybe we could talk
after this is over.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.491
Look, I need you both
to take care of this.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.659
This is not going to
be a problem, is it?

08:14.744 --> 08:15.744
Nope, not at all.
Not at all. Nope.

08:15.828 --> 08:16.828
No, it will not be.

l am on top of it.
Very good.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.748
All right.
Thanks a lot, David.
Talk to you later. . .

let me say goodbye.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.213
All right, l am looking
forward to this.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.339
You don't have to lie.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.008
l hate the fact that we have
to do this together.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.927
l think we work
much better separately.

08:32.011 --> 08:36.139
When l am irritated
and l look at you,
l don't see you anymore.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.516
Right.
All l can see

08:37.600 --> 08:39.935
is how big and gross
the pores on your nose are.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.229
All right.
Let's get started.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.904
Hey, why haven't we ever. . .

08:50.988 --> 08:52.239
We have.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.786
You know, there's no
easy way to do this.

08:57.870 --> 09:01.414
l say we add 1 .5%
to their paychecks

09:01.499 --> 09:03.375
and don't say
anything about it.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.502
Do you mean, like, break in,
in the middle of the night

09:05.586 --> 09:06.795
and change the numbers
on payroll?

09:06.879 --> 09:08.380
No, we can do it
during the day.

09:08.464 --> 09:09.881
lt doesn't have to be
that dramatic, Jim.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.341
Okay.

09:11.425 --> 09:15.971
You know what would help
is a pros and cons list
for our options.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.806
Jim, don't take this
the wrong way.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.849
Are you going to take
this the wrong way?

09:19.934 --> 09:20.934
lt's hard to tell so far.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.352
You use your brain
too much.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.229
l'm sorry,
are you advocating
that l use it less?

09:24.313 --> 09:27.357
Sometimes
the smartest people
don't think at all.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.234
You just
came up with that.
As l was saying it.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.652
Yeah.

09:30.736 --> 09:35.282
Okay, so for
the 1 .5% increase, pro,
everyone gets a little bit.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.200
Con, you look

as they did last year.

into this chart.

spends his time.

and distracting others.

that you were registered,
but l didn't hear where.

we registered anywhere.
We just want cash.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.831

you want my money?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.207
Mmm-hmm.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.251
Will you take a check?

10:28.794 --> 10:29.794
Yeah.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.879
Cool.

the more l think about it,

11:01.118 --> 11:04.245

we should give it
to the salesmen.

That will not
go over well.

it seems smart

happier right now.

Well,

stop me from thinking.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.762
No, l could not
do that, Jim.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.014

crusty little eyes

11:23.099 --> 11:25.225

everything perfect.

my head to Wallace.

you also have a lot
of weaknesses, Michael.

what those are, Jim?

decision very clearly,

an unpopular decision.

Okay. Here's a tough
decision for you,
you suck. You suck.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.775
Michael, wait.
ls that clear
enough for you?

12:15.860 --> 12:21.156
Maybe l'm here for a reason,
because l might have
some good ideas, too.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.450
l've been sitting out there
and l've been learning a lot

12:23.534 --> 12:26.661
and maybe l can
just bring something
different to the table.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.163
Okay, Skippy, here we go.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.499
Why don't you run yourself
out there and tell them?

Truth is we only
have so much money
for raises this year.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.101
So the simple fact is,

12:50.186 --> 12:52.562
some people will get raises
and some people won't.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.230
Now what
we've decided is

12:54.315 --> 12:56.941
we are going
to give those raises
to the sales staff.

we're smart people.

lf we're such
smart adults, then why
don't we get raises?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.500
Excellent question,
genius.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.168
lt's because Jim wants
to give the raises

On a scale of one to 1 0,
l'd say l'm about a four.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.331
What are you usually?

19:27.416 --> 19:29.292
Six. You?

19:29.376 --> 19:32.170
Usually a 1 0,
but l'm feeling
like a zero.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.838
l mean,
a performance-based raise

19:33.922 --> 19:35.339
sounded like
a good idea, right?

19:35.424 --> 19:36.924
l know, l know.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.467
We tried to find
the fairest way to do it.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.594
Yes, we did.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.053
l just. . .

19:44.391 --> 19:45.474
What?

19:45.893 --> 19:47.018
Um. . .

19:47.686 --> 19:49.187
Nothing. l just. . .

19:49.271 --> 19:52.940
l used to have
to do this part alone.
And it was the worst.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.070
l have something
l would like to give you.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.698
MEREDlTH: Michael, come on !
This isn't fair!
KEVlN: Michael !

20:01.742 --> 20:04.702
Michael's my only friend
left in the office.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.581
Except Pam. l think.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.000
She still upset?

20:12.169 --> 20:15.379
ANGELA: Michael,
you cannot just keep
avoiding us like this.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.298
(CHUCKLES)

20:17.549 --> 20:18.716
(LAUGHS)

20:18.800 --> 20:19.759
Thank you.

20:19.843 --> 20:20.843
You're welcome.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.513
What's in here?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.640
Gin.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.651
Ooh.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.154
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

20:44.660 --> 20:46.285
(WHlSPERlNG)
Just pretend
we're not here.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.749
Heard you guys
are looking for cash
for the wedding?

20:51.833 --> 20:54.085
Yeah, l mean,
if it's all
the same for you.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.211
Question for you,

20:55.295 --> 20:59.423
would you guys
rather have $1 00 now
or $5,000 a year from now?

20:59.508 --> 21:00.800
$1 00 now, for sure.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.594
Because you just
give me $50 to cover
the broker fee,

21:03.679 --> 21:06.138
l put in $1 00 of my
own money, as the gift.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.767
Yeah. No, no. The $1 00.
l'll just take the $1 00.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.271
(SOFTLY) lnstead of
$5,000 a year from now?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.232
How sure is this?

21:16.316 --> 21:17.817
The guy has an algorithm

21:17.901 --> 21:21.696
to determine
the winner of any given
college basketball game.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.203
Don't tell Jim.
