THE RIGHT GUY SOMEDAY.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.337
- AT MY AGE, IT BETTER BE
SOME DAY SOON.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.074
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT CRAP
ABOUT "AT YOUR AGE."

11:47.107 --> 11:49.476
EMMETT FELL
FOR GEORGE, RIGHT?

11:49.509 --> 11:50.944
WHICH ONLY PROVES
THAT LOVE IS POSSIBLE

11:50.978 --> 11:52.880
NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.381
- SO WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.350
- I DON'T HAVE AN EXCUSE.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.419
NOR DO I NEED ONE

11:59.452 --> 12:02.923
'CAUSE SOMEONE ASKED ME OUT
TODAY.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.425
- YOU?
- YES, ME.

12:05.458 --> 12:09.162
- I MEAN, WHAT I MEAN IS,
YOU LIVE WITH FAGS.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.798
YOU WORK WITH FAGS.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.966
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A STRAIGHT MAN
IN YEARS.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.503
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU CALL
THAT DETECTIVE?

12:16.536 --> 12:18.371
- THE ONE INVESTIGATING
THE MURDER.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.973
HE ASKED YOU.

12:20.007 --> 12:25.045
- NONE OTHER.
- HOLY SHIT!

12:25.078 --> 12:26.413
SO WHEN ARE YOU GOING?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.281
- I'M NOT.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.850
- YOU TURNED HIM DOWN?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.284
- HE'S NOT MY TYPE.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.153
- HE'S ALIVE,
AND HE'S GOT A DICK.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.888
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?

12:34.922 --> 12:36.389
- SOMEONE WHO'S NOT
A HOMOPHOBE.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.358
- BECAUSE HE MADE
A COUPLE OF CRACKS?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.560
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S A FAG HATER.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.964
IT JUST MEANS HE NEEDS...
ENLIGHTENING.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.198
- SO YOU GO OUT WITH HIM.

12:45.232 --> 12:48.301
- YOU'RE MORE HIS TYPE.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.203
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU WENT ON A DATE?

12:50.237 --> 12:53.807

12:55.843 --> 12:59.112
- MUST BE SO RUSTY
IT SQUEAKS.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.414
- I'VE BEEN BUSY.
- DOING WHAT?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.516
- TAKING CARE OF YOU.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.920
- SO WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE NOW?

13:06.954 --> 13:09.022
- I ALREADY TURNED HIM DOWN.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.558
- YOU'RE A WOMAN.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.460
SOMEWHAT OUT OF PRACTICE,
BUT NONETHELESS,

13:13.493 --> 13:17.497
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE
YOUR MIND.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.937
WELL, GO ON.

13:23.971 --> 13:28.175
JUST SAY YES.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.477
COME ON.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.252

13:41.354 --> 13:45.225
YES!
[groaning]

13:45.258 --> 13:48.561
WHEW! DIDN'T THINK I'D GET
ALL THAT IN THERE.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.931
- WELL, THAT'S THAT.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.967
- YEAH.
AND NOW THAT I AM GONE,

13:54.001 --> 13:56.303
YOU AND BEN WILL HAVE THE PLACE
ALL TO YOURSELVES,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.071
SO YOU CAN HUMP AND BUMP

13:58.105 --> 14:00.941
AND MAKE MAD,
PASSIONATE LOVE

14:00.974 --> 14:02.342
AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS

14:02.375 --> 14:04.211
WITHOUT ME LISTENING
THROUGH THE WALLS.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.478
[chuckling]

14:05.512 --> 14:08.048
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
MAYBE I'LL STAY.

14:08.081 --> 14:11.618
[car horn honking]

14:11.651 --> 14:14.587

- COME ON UP, GEORGIE.
[giggling]

14:23.363 --> 14:26.199
GOD, GOT TO REMEMBER
NOT TO ACT LIKE A SHOPGIRL.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.969
DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS HIM
WORLDWIDE.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.904
- WHY WOULD YOU
EMBARRASS HIM?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.906
- WELL, BACK IN HAZLEHURST,

14:32.940 --> 14:35.342
GEORGE IS WHAT WE USED
TO CALL REFINED,

14:35.375 --> 14:38.045
AND I AM WHAT WE USED
TO CALL A PIECE OF TRASH.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.281
SOMEONE LIKE HIM WOULD NEVER
ASSOCIATE WITH THE LIKES OF ME.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.650
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT
IN HAZLEHURST ANYMORE,

14:43.683 --> 14:45.919
AND GEORGE
DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.555
- I KNOW.

14:48.588 --> 14:53.961
IT'S JUST
MORE THAN I EVER DREAMED.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.129
- YOU DESERVE
A FABULOUS LIFE, EM.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.265
AS FABULOUS AS YOU.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.545
- OH, WOW!
LET ME REPHRASE THAT.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.147
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU HAVEN'T PACKED?

15:14.181 --> 15:18.318

15:18.351 --> 15:21.955

- AH, THANKS, MICHAEL.

15:21.989 --> 15:25.592
- I'LL TAKE THAT, SIR.

15:25.625 --> 15:30.363

UM, MAKE SURE YOU TELL
THE ASSHOLE SUPER

LAST WINTER WE HAD TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM IN PARKAS.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.643
OH, AND MAKE SURE HE REPAINTS
IN THE SPRING.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.445
ALTHOUGH HE'S ONLY BEEN
PROMISING FOR, LIKE,

15:45.478 --> 15:50.150
TWO YEARS.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.519
OKAY.

MM, I'M...

15:56.223 --> 15:59.459
REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.061

TO INTERRUPT THIS,

16:01.094 --> 16:05.498
BUT WE GOT
A PLANE TO CATCH.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.468

16:17.410 --> 16:19.246
SO THAT I CAN FINISH
A PROJECT.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.480
- MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.116
THIS ISN'T A PARTY.
THIS IS A BUSINESS.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.417
I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO DEPEND ON MY EMPLOYEES

16:24.451 --> 16:26.619
TO SHOW UP ON TIME,
DO THEIR JOB.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.290
- IF I DON'T, MY PROFESSOR SAID
HE'S GOING TO FAIL ME.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.725
- I FEEL FOR YOU, KIDDO,
I REALLY DO.

16:32.759 --> 16:37.097
- RIGHT.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.365

16:38.398 --> 16:40.767
JUST THIS ONCE,
I'LL LET YOU OFF.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.237

17:16.169 --> 17:17.537

YOU'RE HUNG.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.077
- I ALREADY DO.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.645
- SO HOW DID YOU GET
THE NIGHT OFF?

17:25.678 --> 17:26.846
- [clears throat]
I TOLD THE BOSS

17:26.879 --> 17:28.415
I HAD TO FINISH A PROJECT.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.451

I TOLD YOU
I COULD HANDLE IT.

THE WHOLE WEEKEND IF I JUST WENT

17:42.795 --> 17:44.597
TO SOME AFTER-HOURS PARTY
AT HIS HOUSE.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.167
- FOR WHAT?

17:47.200 --> 17:51.304
- HE WANTS SOME PRETTY BOYS
THERE FOR DECORATION.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.640
- WHO ELSE IS GOING TO BE THERE?
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

17:53.673 --> 17:55.308
HIS FRIENDS.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.210
- I CAN IMAGINE
WHAT KIND OF FRIENDS HE HAS.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.146
AND I CAN GUESS
WHAT KIND OF PARTY HE'S HAVING.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.713
THAT GUY'S A FUCKING SLEAZE.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.450

18:05.485 --> 18:09.522
I KNOW HOW YOU GOT
TO DANCE ON THE BAR.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.324
- I LET HIM BLOW ME.

18:11.358 --> 18:14.227
BIG DEAL.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.166
- I'LL GIVE YOU $5,000.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.534
- WHAT FOR?

18:21.568 --> 18:24.637
- THAT DRAWING.

18:24.671 --> 18:29.276
- IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

18:29.309 --> 18:33.146
- NO.
JUST YOU.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.617
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.920
I'M STILL PUTTING ON
YOUR MASCARA.

HORVATH KNOWS
WHAT I LOOK LIKE.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.560

YOU LOOK LIKE
A PRINCESS.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.352

LIKE THE QUEEN MOTHER.

"NOT BAD."

SHE'S DUG HER HIGH HEELS IN,
AND SHE'S NOT BUDGING.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.866

20:43.075 --> 20:45.345
WHY SHOULD SHE BE
ANY DIFFERENT FROM US?

THAT DETECTIVE?

22:03.723 --> 22:05.792
- WHAT?
- IF YOU'RE VERY QUIET,

22:05.825 --> 22:08.695
YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR THEM MOO.

22:08.728 --> 22:11.097
- WHO?
- THE CATTLE IN COACH.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.132
- OH.
- I KNOW.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.801
I USED TO BE
ONE OF THE HERD.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.903
BUT NOW I AM FINALLY ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CURTAIN,

22:16.936 --> 22:19.839
AND IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.441
- WELL, FROM NOW ON,
I HOPE THE WORLD

22:21.474 --> 22:23.576
WILL BE A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

22:23.610 --> 22:24.944
- HMM.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.779
IT WILL BE...

22:26.813 --> 22:29.382
'CAUSE I'M WITH YOU.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.883
- WOULD YOU FIND IT
TERRIBLY TEDIOUS

22:30.917 --> 22:33.586
IF I TOLD YOU
HOW MARVELOUS YOU ARE?

22:33.620 --> 22:34.987
HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME?

22:35.021 --> 22:38.858
- I WILL TRY
TO ENDURE IT.

22:38.891 --> 22:43.730
- I TELL YOU, EMMETT, NO ONE'S
EVER GIVEN ME SUCH PLEASURE.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.666
I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO MAKE LOVE
AT EVERY DESTINATION.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.568
- MM.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.770
- YEAH, AT MACHU PICCHU.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.540
IN A GONDOLA IN VENICE.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.608
ON THE GREAT WALL
OF CHINA.

22:55.642 --> 23:00.913
- I WONDER IF THERE'S
A 3,000-YEAR-OLD GLORY HOLE.

23:00.947 --> 23:04.917
- I WISH WE COULD DO IT
RIGHT NOW.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.720
- WHY NOT?

23:07.754 --> 23:10.657
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE MILE HIGH CLUB?

23:10.690 --> 23:13.893
HONEY, IT'S WHY WILBUR
AND ORVILLE INVENTED AVIATION.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.496
YOU GO
IN THE LITTLE BOYS' ROOM FIRST.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.498
THEN WHEN NO ONE'S LOOKING,

23:18.531 --> 23:20.767
I SLIP IN AND...

23:20.800 --> 23:23.135
[whispering inaudibly]

23:26.939 --> 23:31.511
- OKAY.
- MM-HMM.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.209
[lock clicks]

24:03.242 --> 24:04.243
- * SURELY IT WAS FATE

24:04.276 --> 24:05.978
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD CHILDREN.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.080
- YEAH, TWO.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.816
MY SON, CARL JR.

24:09.849 --> 24:13.019
HE'S IN THE AIR FORCE,
STATIONED IN GERMANY.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.186
HE'S GOT
A COUPLE OF LITTLE ONES.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.923
- VERY NICE.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.959
- MY DAUGHTER VICKI.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.261
NAMED AFTER HER MOM,
GOD REST HER SOUL.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.930
SHE'S IN SALT LAKE.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.765
SHE'S A MUSIC TEACHER.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.166
- MARRIED?

24:27.199 --> 24:29.502
- UH-HUH.
TO A BLACK GUY.

24:29.536 --> 24:32.839
- OH.
- DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.173
- DID YOU HEAR ME
SAY A WORD?

24:34.206 --> 24:36.743
- HE'S NICE ENOUGH.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.178
HE'S A LAWYER.
SUCCESSFUL.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.813
- BUT YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.249
- WELL, I'M WORKING ON IT.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.217
- BIG OF YOU.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.587
- YOU GOT ENOUGH THERE?
- MM-HMM.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.822
PLENTY.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.223
- I JUST DON'T GET
WHY SHE'D WANT TO GO MAKE

24:51.257 --> 24:54.126
HER LIFE MORE DIFFICULT.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.162
I TRIED TALKING
TO HER, BUT...

24:56.195 --> 24:58.064
- YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN'T DICTATE
TO YOUR KIDS

24:58.097 --> 25:00.967
ABOUT HOW TO LIVE THEIR LIFE
OR WHO TO LOVE.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.170
AND THE MORE YOU DO,
THE WORSE IT GETS.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.138
- SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE TALKING

25:06.172 --> 25:09.876
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HERE.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.713
- MY SON'S SEEING SOMEBODY
WHO'S HIV-POSITIVE.

25:14.781 --> 25:15.948
- HOLY SHIT.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.985
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.754
BUT TRY TALKING TO HIM,
AND HE'LL BITE YOUR HEAD OFF.

25:21.788 --> 25:25.625
- WELL, I GUESS
IT'S LIKE YOU SAY...

25:25.658 --> 25:27.827
IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.997
WE'RE JUST THE POOR SUCKERS
WHO BROUGHT THEM INTO THE WORLD.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.566
I WORRY FOR HER, THOUGH.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.635
FOR THE KIDS
THEY MIGHT HAVE.

25:35.668 --> 25:36.869
HMM.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.038
- I WORRY TOO...

25:39.071 --> 25:41.340
FOR MY KID'S LIFE.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.909
SO I'M AN OGRE.

25:42.942 --> 25:46.012
- A DAMN PRETTY ONE.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.715
- DON'T TRY
TO SWEET-TALK ME.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.951
- WHAT?
CAN'T YOU TAKE A COMPLIMENT?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.185
- IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE I'VE HAD ONE,

25:53.219 --> 25:54.654
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.723
- YOU SAVOR IT,
LIKE THIS.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.290
- * AGAIN

25:58.324 --> 26:00.226
* ON THE OTHER SIDE

26:00.259 --> 26:01.861
*

26:01.894 --> 26:04.363
* ON THE OTHER SIDE

26:04.396 --> 26:08.134
- ALL RIGHT, CHEERS.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.237
- [chuckling]

26:14.373 --> 26:15.842
- [panting]

26:15.875 --> 26:17.944
- AH, IT'S PRETTY TIGHT
IN HERE.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.979
- THANK YOU.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.056
[P.A. chimes]

26:30.089 --> 26:31.223
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

26:31.257 --> 26:32.692
WE'RE EXPERIENCING
A LITTLE TURBULENCE.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.093
- THEM TOO?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.962
- THE CAPTAIN HAS TURNED
ON THE OVERHEAD SEAT BELT SIGN

26:35.995 --> 26:38.364
AND REQUESTS THAT YOU
PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR SEAT.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.933
- SORRY, MY SEAT'S TAKEN.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.903
- [groaning]

26:43.936 --> 26:46.238
- [shushes]

26:46.272 --> 26:49.876
WE DON'T WANT THE STEWARD
HEARING AND BURSTING IN,

26:49.909 --> 26:51.110
ALTHOUGH HE WAS
KIND OF CUTE.

26:51.143 --> 26:55.281
- [moaning]

27:01.053 --> 27:04.056
- THAT SOUNDED LIKE
A GOOD ONE.

27:07.059 --> 27:10.897
YOU ALL RIGHT, GEORGE?

27:10.930 --> 27:12.631
GEORGE?

27:16.035 --> 27:20.006
GEORGE?

27:20.039 --> 27:23.175
OH, MY GOD.
GEOR...

27:23.209 --> 27:26.412
OH, MY GOD.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.314
GEOR--
GEORGE, ARE YOU--

27:28.347 --> 27:29.782
OH, MY GOD.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.885
[muttering]

27:38.457 --> 27:42.461
SOMEBODY HELP US!
[whimpering]

27:42.494 --> 27:44.030
GEORGE...
GOD.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.732
SOMEBODY...
[banging on door]

27:45.765 --> 27:46.999
SOMEBODY!

27:47.033 --> 27:49.135
SOMEBODY HELP US, PLEASE!

27:49.168 --> 27:51.337
GOD.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.916
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

28:03.950 --> 28:06.185
YOU WAITING UP FOR ME?

28:06.218 --> 28:07.353
- IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.056
- GONNA GROUND ME?

28:10.089 --> 28:11.190
- YOU'RE DRUNK.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.359
- I'VE HAD A COUPLE
OF GLASSES OF WINE

28:13.392 --> 28:16.295
AND A VERY NICE TIME,
IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.164
- WITH THAT HOMOPHOBIC PRICK?

28:18.197 --> 28:20.933
- HE'S NOT
A HOMOPHOBIC PRICK.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.069
- OKAY,
SO NOW WHAT IS HE?

28:23.102 --> 28:26.238
- HE'S A 55-YEAR-OLD
STRAIGHT GUY

28:26.272 --> 28:29.341
WITH 55-YEAR-OLD
STRAIGHT GUY ATTITUDES

28:29.375 --> 28:31.143
WHO NEEDS HIS EYES OPENED.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.745
- HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.346
FOR A FREE MEAL
AND A LITTLE ATTENTION,

28:34.380 --> 28:36.515
YOU'RE WILLING TO OVERLOOK
EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN?

28:36.548 --> 28:38.918
- YOU DON'T KNOW HIM,
MICHAEL.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.220
- NEITHER DO YOU.
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.521
AND IF YOU DON'T APPROVE,

28:42.554 --> 28:44.156
THEN I SUGGEST YOU FOLLOW
YOUR OWN ADVICE

28:44.190 --> 28:46.358
WHEN I SAID I DIDN'T WANT YOU
SEEING BEN,

28:46.392 --> 28:51.430
AND MIND
YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.233
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT TRY
REMEMBERING ALL THE YEARS

28:54.266 --> 28:56.502
THAT I RAISED YOU AND LOOKED
AFTER YOUR UNCLE VIC

28:56.535 --> 28:58.938
WITHOUT EVER TAKING A MINUTE
FOR MYSELF.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.339
AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME

29:00.372 --> 29:03.242
A GUY ASKS ME OUT

29:03.275 --> 29:06.012
IN I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
HOW LONG,

29:06.045 --> 29:08.080
AND YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,

29:08.114 --> 29:10.016
INSTEAD OF BEING HAPPY
FOR ME.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.517
- WHAT, HAPPY YOU'RE
SO FUCKING DESPERATE

29:11.550 --> 29:13.853
YOU'LL GO OUT WITH ANYONE?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.236
- * PIGS IN A BLANKET

29:30.269 --> 29:32.438
* WITH BIG CYCLOPS

29:32.471 --> 29:35.541
* CHICKENS ARE HOPPIN'

29:35.574 --> 29:37.143
* THE FOX IS
IN THE BARN *

29:37.176 --> 29:39.879
* NO RHYME OR REASON

29:39.912 --> 29:43.415
- SAVE SOME FOR OTHER--
both: DON'T WORRY.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.886
- * EVERYTHING IS CRAZY
ON ANIMAL FARM *

29:46.919 --> 29:50.089
* KICK IT

29:50.122 --> 29:52.458
*

29:52.491 --> 29:56.262
[laughter]

29:56.295 --> 29:57.396
- HI, GUY.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.398
- * CHANGE ALL THE LAWS

29:59.431 --> 30:02.168
* CHANGE ALL THE RULES

30:02.201 --> 30:04.270
* IF NOBODY'S WATCHIN'

30:04.303 --> 30:06.538
- COOL PLACE, HUH?
- YEAH.

30:06.572 --> 30:09.441
COOL.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.477
- * OR TOO COOL TO BE COOL

30:11.510 --> 30:13.612
* IT'S ALL IN THE WILD

30:13.645 --> 30:16.315
* ON ANIMAL FARM

30:16.348 --> 30:18.951
* DISORDER AND CHAOS

30:18.985 --> 30:22.021
* DISORDER
AND CHAOS *

30:22.054 --> 30:23.956
* DISORDER AND CHAOS
- [chuckles]

30:23.990 --> 30:26.926
- * ON ANIMAL FARM

30:26.959 --> 30:28.594
- WANT SOME?

30:28.627 --> 30:29.996
- NO, THANKS.

30:30.029 --> 30:34.934
- COME ON.
LOOSEN UP, RELAX.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.406
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR SHIRT OFF?

30:40.439 --> 30:42.474
- WHAT FOR?

30:42.508 --> 30:45.444
- IT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE,
REMEMBER?

30:45.477 --> 30:47.646
- DECORATION.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.282
- THAT WAS THE DEAL.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.124
THAT'S BETTER.

30:58.157 --> 31:01.493
- OUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE LOOKS
LIKE HE COULD USE A DRINK.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.096
WHY DON'T WE OFFER HIM
SOMETHING?

31:04.130 --> 31:07.066
- LATER.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.268
- [chuckles]

31:12.171 --> 31:14.106
- [inhales]

31:14.140 --> 31:17.944
GO AHEAD.
IT'S GREAT SHIT.

31:32.691 --> 31:36.262
- OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
A LITTLE TOO STRONG?

31:36.295 --> 31:37.997
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

31:38.030 --> 31:41.934
YEAH.
- NICE.

31:41.968 --> 31:46.138
- BEAUTIFUL BODY.

31:46.172 --> 31:50.176
- I MEAN,
MICHAEL'S GOT BEN.

31:50.209 --> 31:54.080
YOU'VE GOT JUSTIN.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.983
EVEN EMMETT HAS GEORGE,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

31:57.016 --> 32:01.087
HOW COME EVERYBODY'S
GOT SOMEONE EXCEPT ME?

32:01.120 --> 32:02.488
- THE REASON YOU DON'T HAVE
A BOYFRIEND

32:02.521 --> 32:05.024
IS BECAUSE YOU
DON'T WANT ONE.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.059
- I DON'T?

32:07.093 --> 32:08.961
- IF YOU HAD ONE,
IT WOULD CHALLENGE

32:08.995 --> 32:11.563
THE WELL-ESTABLISHED OPINION
YOU HAVE OF YOURSELF

32:11.597 --> 32:14.400
AS A WORTHLESS SACK OF SHIT
THAT NOBODY WANTS.

32:14.433 --> 32:18.204
THEREFORE, YOU GO AFTER GUYS
YOU KNOW WILL REJECT YOU.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.238
THEN YOU STAND AROUND HERE

32:19.271 --> 32:22.008
AND BITCH
LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL,

32:22.041 --> 32:25.111
WHEN IN FACT YOU'VE GOTTEN
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT,

32:25.144 --> 32:28.947
MAINLY NOTHING.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.654
- [sniffs]

32:35.687 --> 32:37.089
WELL, THANK YOU,
DR. KINNEY.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.557
YOU'VE SAVED ME YEARS
OF THERAPY,

32:38.590 --> 32:42.261
NOT TO MENTION
SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.097
- SHE HIT ME.
MY MOTHER FUCKING HIT ME.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.332
- SHE'S ALWAYS
HITTING YOU.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.000
- THAT'S HOW SHE SHOWS
HER AFFECTION.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.568
- I MEAN FOR REAL.

32:49.601 --> 32:50.769
- WELL, WHAT DID MIKEY DO?

32:50.802 --> 32:56.208
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

32:56.242 --> 32:59.078
I TOLD HER SHE WAS PATHETIC
FOR DATING THAT FAG-HATING COP.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.312
- YOU KNOW,
IF SHE KEEPS THIS UP,

33:00.346 --> 33:02.281
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE
HER HONORARY QUEER BUTTON AWAY.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.616
- WHERE ARE HER VALUES?
HER PRINCIPLES?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.485
- YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
WHEN YOU WANT COCK.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.455
THEY'RE THE FIRST THINGS
TO GO.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.358
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

33:12.391 --> 33:16.428
LITTLE MIKEY'S JEALOUS.

33:16.462 --> 33:17.663
LITTLE MIKEY'S
JEALOUS.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.665
- WOULD YOU SHUT
THE FUCK UP?

33:19.698 --> 33:22.768
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:22.801 --> 33:24.770
- DO YOU THINK
THEY DID IT?

33:24.803 --> 33:26.605
DO YOU THINK HE SLIPPED HER
THE BIG GREASER?

33:26.638 --> 33:28.174
- HOW ABOUT SOME MUSIC?

33:28.207 --> 33:32.311
- IT'S JUST YOUR GARDEN-VARIETY
OEDIPAL THING.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.280
ALL YOUR LIFE,
YOU'VE BEEN HER LITTLE MAN,

33:34.313 --> 33:36.648
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
SOME BIG, OLD DICK POPS UP,

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,

37:51.770 --> 37:54.072
A HEART ATTACK

37:54.105 --> 37:57.843
BROUGHT ON
BY OVEREXERTION.

37:59.345 --> 38:03.915
- WELL...
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

38:03.949 --> 38:07.553
LUCKY TO HAVE A HEART SPECIALIST
ON BOARD.

38:07.586 --> 38:11.523
- ACTUALLY, I'M A DOCTOR
OF ECONOMICS.

38:11.557 --> 38:16.027
BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENED
TO MY UNCLE.

38:16.061 --> 38:18.997
WHAT A WAY TO GO.

I CAN GET YOU?

38:32.778 --> 38:34.112

38:34.145 --> 38:38.550
I COULD REALLY USE
A DRINK.

I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE HIM ALONE.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.096
- MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

38:51.129 --> 38:54.065
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
JUST HOLLER.

38:54.099 --> 38:58.470

39:16.755 --> 39:20.492
I GUESS STARDOM
SOMETIMES HAS ITS ADVANTAGES.

39:25.964 --> 39:31.136
SO HERE WE ARE, HONEY,

39:54.159 --> 39:56.528
- I DON'T MEAN THAT.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.764
ALL THE PORNO FLICKS I'VE SEEN

39:58.797 --> 40:00.098
ALWAYS SHOW
THESE HOT CRIMINAL TYPES

40:00.131 --> 40:02.167
IN HEAVY MAN-ON-MAN ACTION.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.802
NOTHING LIKE THIS.

40:03.835 --> 40:07.172
- YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR EITHER.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.809

40:37.536 --> 40:39.471
- A WORD?

40:43.642 --> 40:46.011
IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM,
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT

40:46.044 --> 40:48.213
INSTEAD OF TAKING IT OUT ON
THE OFFICER WHO PULLED YOU OVER.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.015
- YOU'RE A HOMOPHOBIC BIGOT,
AND I WANT YOU

40:50.048 --> 40:53.485
TO STAY AWAY
FROM MY MOTHER.

40:53.519 --> 40:55.020

41:00.992 --> 41:03.729
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.263
BUT THEN YOU COULD SAY
THE SAME THING ABOUT ME,

41:05.296 --> 41:06.632
SO WE'RE EVEN.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.934
AS FOR YOUR MOTHER,

41:08.967 --> 41:11.202
SHE'S A VERY NICE LADY.

BUT I LIKE THAT.

41:15.774 --> 41:20.245
AND SHE SURE AS HELL
LOVES YOU.

41:20.278 --> 41:24.683
GO PAY YOUR SPEEDING TICKET
AT THE FRONT DESK.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.985
THERE'LL BE NO RECORD
OF YOUR NIGHT IN THE SLAMMER

FOR YOU OR YOUR FRIENDS.

41:42.901 --> 41:45.904

- HOW ABOUT YOU?

42:16.602 --> 42:18.970
- UH, WHEATIES.

42:21.907 --> 42:23.975
- MOM, DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

42:24.009 --> 42:27.012

BACON, RAISIN TOAST.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.214
- I MEANT THE SORRY PART.
I SAID I'M SORRY.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.717
- LIKE YOU WERE ORDERING
SOMETHING OFF A MENU.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.251
AND YOU EXPECT ME
TO SERVE YOU UP

A NICE PLATE
OF FORGIVENESS.

42:36.354 --> 42:40.792
JUST LIKE THAT.

42:40.826 --> 42:43.228

AND LET YOU TWO WORK THIS OUT.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.597
- STAY.

42:50.035 --> 42:52.070
I HAD NO RIGHT TO JUDGE
DETECTIVE HORVATH

42:52.103 --> 42:53.939
WITHOUT KNOWING HIM.

42:53.972 --> 42:59.210
AND I HAD NO RIGHT SAYING
THE THINGS TO YOU THAT I SAID.

42:59.244 --> 43:02.080
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO DATE
WHOEVER YOU WANT.

43:02.113 --> 43:04.382
- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT
I AM.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.653
- RIGHT.

43:07.686 --> 43:10.221
BUT THEN SO AM I.

43:24.135 --> 43:27.739

COMING RIGHT UP, BEN.

43:29.975 --> 43:31.843
- THANK YOU.

44:01.740 --> 44:04.375

44:32.971 --> 44:35.774
- FUCK THE SAP.

44:35.807 --> 44:38.076
ANYWAY...

44:38.109 --> 44:40.912
I QUIT.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.581
I DECIDED THAT

44:43.614 --> 44:46.718
WORKING ALL NIGHT AND GOING
TO SCHOOL DURING THE DAY

44:46.752 --> 44:51.222
WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
TO MY GOALS.

44:51.256 --> 44:53.191
I NEED TO PRIORITIZE,

44:53.224 --> 44:55.961
CONCENTRATE ON MY ART.

44:55.994 --> 44:58.296
SO...

INTEREST,
REPAYMENT SCHEDULE.

45:17.515 --> 45:21.086

45:29.795 --> 45:33.832
- SO WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

45:33.865 --> 45:36.835
- A MAN NEEDS TO KNOW
