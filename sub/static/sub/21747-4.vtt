WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:03.550
I love u... nicorns.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.830
I love unicorns, too.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.670
The fact that your girlfriend
had an affair with my husband

00:08.720 --> 00:10.350
needn't stop us being friends.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.030
- You told her we're working together?
- No, that, er, hasn't come up.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.190
Whilst I'm gone, you have to check on Mum.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.710
- I won't need checking on!
- She will.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.030
Since I've been living with her
I've noticed a (deterioration).

00:23.080 --> 00:26.150
- You seem a little on edge, Karen.
- No shit, Sherlock.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.790
I'm dissolving our partnership.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.950
I assume you can't afford my
share, so I shall buy you out.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.830
- That looks bloody painful!
- It is!

00:32.880 --> 00:36.110
I'm on a cocktail of
painkillers and cocktails.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.630
It helps take the edge off.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.190
I look forward to seeing
the Mona Lisa-like results.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.920
I made an appointment at the clinic.
I'm going to have an abortion.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.390
- Are you seeing Olivia after school?
- Hadn't planned to.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.350
Everything's all right between you two?

00:57.400 --> 00:58.560
Why wouldn't it be?

01:00.640 --> 01:01.880
It's fine.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.750
She's revising for exams.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.230
- Well, maybe you should
be too, eh? - Mm-hm.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.960
Matt?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.480
If you want to talk at
all... about anything.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.350
Olivia, I know it's really difficult
to put it out of your mind, but --

01:26.400 --> 01:28.590
I was trying to remember
the periodic table.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.670
- We have a test today.
- Oh, good!

01:30.720 --> 01:36.070
- I thought you were thinking about --
- My abortion? No. Though I am now.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.260
(Oh.)

01:40.400 --> 01:43.270
- Got your P.E. kit?
- Can I have a note?

01:43.320 --> 01:44.750
Nothing wrong with ya.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.510
I got no sleep. Adam snores like a pig.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.150
- Has anyone seen my cowboy hat?
- I slept like a log.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.470
Yeah, in MY bed! I hate having
to share with my brother.

01:54.520 --> 01:58.350
Don't suppose it's his idea of a
good time, either. Mum, please!

01:58.400 --> 02:00.990
I'm doing country and western
so I need my cowboy hat.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.070
- They're old. They won't care.
- Hm. Or notice, most of them.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.190
Chloe's right, you could sing anything.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.110
Another one bites the dust.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.310
Adam, have you seen my cowboy hat?

02:10.360 --> 02:12.510
Didn't you wear it when
you were Indiana Jones?

02:12.560 --> 02:17.600
Oh, yeah. It might be under my
bed. Or Gran's, I should say.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.760
He's sensitive.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.400
And he's grieving.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.400
And... he's resilient too.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.120
He'll be fine, I promise.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.040
I hope so.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.510
We're off. You gonna be all
right on your own, Mum?

02:46.560 --> 02:49.600
Course I will. What harm can I get into?

02:51.280 --> 02:54.430
- Adam, ready?
- I just need a word with Dad.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.310
Blimey! Passin' up a lift.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.270
Must be serious. Love ya.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.600
- I'm in a hurry, too!
- It's important.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.080 --> 03:15.430
This isn't easy for me to say.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.950
Oh, come on, what is it?
In trouble with the police?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.550
Drugs? Shoplifting? You've not
been caught pissing in the street?

03:22.600 --> 03:23.960
Thanks, Dad (!)

03:26.200 --> 03:27.350
It's porn.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.430
Right, OK. Well, porn...

03:30.480 --> 03:32.670
- Erm...
- You know Smeg?

03:32.720 --> 03:34.320
The bass player in your band.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.470
The bloke's his music teacher.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.910
Oh. Plays the horn, does he?

03:41.960 --> 03:45.830
- What are you showing me this for?!
- Look at the woman.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.110
I am.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.550
Her face.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.590
Bloody hell!

03:52.640 --> 03:55.550
I don't know when it was filmed.
It could've been years ago.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.890
For Adam's sake, I hope it was!

04:00.960 --> 04:02.190
Oh, hi.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.390
You don't need to keep checking up on me.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.190
I wasn't, just needed to
have a word with your mum.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.040
And you didn't think to phone?

04:10.840 --> 04:12.910
I'm fine, Dad.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.070
Seeing as you're here, can
you give us a lift to school?

04:16.120 --> 04:17.720
Save us the walk.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.230
Thanks for coming over.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.950
Well, you once accused me of behaving

04:27.000 --> 04:29.270
as though fatherhood ends with conception.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.430
It doesn't even end at divorce.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.150
Dad?

04:33.200 --> 04:36.150
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.080
Look, if there's anything
else I can do to help.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.110
David, if you mean that,

04:46.160 --> 04:48.910
you know my little disagreement
with my business partner?

04:48.960 --> 04:51.150
Little? He's trying to force you out.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.910
If I send my accounts to you,
would you cast your eye over them?

04:54.960 --> 04:58.560
Since it's you, shall we
say half my usual rate?

04:59.560 --> 05:02.430
Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.

05:02.480 --> 05:06.160
Oh, please, Karen! I'll even come
to your meeting if you want back up.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.110
Thanks, David.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.270
You know, when we were young,
everyone went for a lunch time pint.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.470
Now it seems, I don't
know, vaguely degenerate.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.400
- There you go.
- Thanks, mate.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.360
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.
Not, not, not there. Not there.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.920
- Follow me. No, no, no.
- What's wrong with that table?

05:38.240 --> 05:40.350
I've got something I need to show you.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.990
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.110
Oh, if it's the one with the
porcupine eating the carrot,

05:45.160 --> 05:46.430
I've already seen it.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.960
Well, unless that's code,
I don't think you have.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.640
Bloody hell.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.430
Why are you showing me this?

05:59.480 --> 06:02.870
Oh! Oh! Oh!

06:02.920 --> 06:04.200
Oh, my God.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.230
Oh, my God!

06:10.720 --> 06:12.120
Is this on the Internet?

06:15.920 --> 06:17.950
- Have you watched it?
- I had to.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.750
For identification purposes obviously!

06:20.800 --> 06:21.960
All the way through?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.150
Jesus!

06:27.200 --> 06:28.590
Does Tina do yoga?

06:28.640 --> 06:31.640
- Are you lookin' at a dig in the head?
- Right, OK. I'm sorry.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.430
- Can you forward that on to me?
- What, do you want a copy?

06:35.480 --> 06:37.590
Not for me! But Tina's
gonna want to see it.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.830
Are you sure?

06:40.280 --> 06:41.760
Oh, God. Oh, God.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.310
- David.
- Oh, that's healing nicely.

06:56.360 --> 07:00.310
Yeah, I can go out in public soon.
Re-join the ladies who lunch.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.710
At least you'll have
something to talk about.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.310
Nobody ever mentions cosmetic surgery.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.950
Not to your face! Coffee?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.430
I'm not stupid. Know
what I mean? Hi, David.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.150
Thank you, yes.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.640
Erm, I hope you don't mind me
taking on your husband as a client.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.150
Well, what's in his interest
is in mine, isn't it?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.760
Hm.

07:27.120 --> 07:31.470
Look, David, it wasn't like
I intended to leave him.

07:31.520 --> 07:35.630
I just wanted to know I had the option.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.830
Now I no longer need to.

07:37.880 --> 07:41.310
Ever since he got wind of what I was
doing, he couldn't be more attentive.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.790
Bends over backwards
to make sure I'm happy.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.390
- The, erm?
- Mm-hm.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.510
And the jewellery.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.470
Ooh, hock that and you'll be
able to live off the proceeds.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.310
Mm, for a month or two.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.990
So, what have you got for me?

07:55.040 --> 08:00.550
I've got, first up, The Arcadia.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.030
Sale price $400,000.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.590
You get someone to sail it across to
another island and re-register it.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.630
You're moving your wealth offshore,
beyond the gaze of the tax man.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.190
I like it. I might even use it one day.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.350
You could part finance it with your
Deutsche Bank account -- It's doing nothing.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.430
What Deutsche Bank account?

08:19.480 --> 08:22.990
Oh, your last accountant,
er, Danny, set it up.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.670
I assume as a sort of
emergency, rainy day fund.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.080
I don't have rainy days.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.480
I'm sure it's easily explained.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.150
Oh, God.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.960
Where did you get it from?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.880
From Pete, who got it from Adam...

08:58.920 --> 09:00.510
.. who got it from school.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.760
Oh, Jesus!

09:03.800 --> 09:07.600
- Looks like it was in your apartment.
- Watched it more than once, have ya?

09:08.800 --> 09:11.480
It's not exactly the
first thing you'd notice.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.480
- When was it filmed?
- I don't know!

09:20.800 --> 09:22.510
Three years ago.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.990
It was Jamie's idea.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.630
It was just something we did for a while.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.000
- What, sex?
- Filmed it.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.240
Why has he put it online?!

09:36.600 --> 09:39.910
Revenge? You know, you did dump him.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.880
But why now?!

09:46.480 --> 09:48.870
I suppose it's all around Adam's class.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.550
- School.
- Dad?

09:51.600 --> 09:54.160
I think there's something you need to see.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.000
No matter.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.310
Possibly spread to other schools.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.030
Oh, God, I feel sick.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.430
Yeah.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.270
No, actually, I think I
am... I'm gonna be sick!

10:10.320 --> 10:11.510
What?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.520
I'm sorry.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.160
You've got nothing to apologise for.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.360
Oi!

10:42.920 --> 10:44.990
I heard they were dredging the canals.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.950
Look what they dragged up.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.590
I'd throw you in but there's
enough shite already.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.870
Hm. What do you want?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.750
You owe Tina an apology.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.190
I didn't post that video.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.070
You know what I'm talking about though?

10:59.120 --> 11:00.880
Oh, I've been shown it.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.680
Like you, by the looks of it.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.550
So, how'd it get out there?

11:06.600 --> 11:10.070
- Hacked by the Russians, were ya?
- It wasn't me.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.710
I don't know what's more pathetic,

11:11.760 --> 11:14.710
you posting the video or
pretending you didn't.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.550
Why would I do it? I've
got nothing to gain.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.230
I could lose my job over this.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.480
Tina is devastated.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.390
Yes, I should call her.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.750
Oh, no. No. You stay away from her.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.160
Says who? You?

11:31.160 --> 11:33.030
It's not the filthiest we made.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.150
I could show you those.
I've still got them.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.120
No, you probably wouldn't enjoy them.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.990
You could tell she did.

11:40.040 --> 11:43.480
Well, I can. Maybe you wouldn't know.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.680
Leave her alone.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.970
Ugh, the day I've had!

12:10.020 --> 12:13.210
- Not as bad as mine I'll bet.
- Didn't even have time for a cuppa.

12:13.260 --> 12:17.610
- Oh, I quite fancy one myself.
- Oh, go on then if you're making one.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.970
I can safely say that my
country and western turn

12:22.020 --> 12:23.650
didn't go as well as I thought.

12:25.780 --> 12:30.250
♪ Come on, silver lady, take my word

12:30.300 --> 12:34.250

12:34.300 --> 12:36.050

12:39.940 --> 12:43.170
- Right, let me through.
- Pete! Don't stop. Distract them!

12:44.620 --> 12:48.570
♪ Come on silver lady Take my word... ♪

12:48.620 --> 12:50.290
It doesn't look good if someone

12:50.340 --> 12:53.250
actually dies during your performance.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.970
Can't blame her for losing
the will to live though.

12:56.020 --> 12:59.170
- I'll be back by 9:00.
- I hope you're wearing something over that!

12:59.220 --> 13:01.210
Gran, it's not the 1980s.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.170
They all dress like that now, Mum.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.530
I would never have let you
go out looking like that!

13:05.580 --> 13:08.930
You'd have had me wearing a hijab
if you'd known what they were.

13:08.980 --> 13:10.980
At least you never looked like a slattern!

13:12.020 --> 13:14.010
- Mum!
- What's a slattern?

13:14.060 --> 13:18.530
- Someone with no sense of fashion.
- With no sense of decorum!

13:18.580 --> 13:22.290
I'm perfectly capable of nagging,
insulting and mothering my daughter!

13:22.340 --> 13:24.570
- Thank you very much!
- You're not though, are ya?!

13:24.620 --> 13:27.210
- Otherwise you wouldn't be
at work all hours. - What?!

13:27.260 --> 13:29.370
- Hey, what, what's that smell?
- Oh, my God!

13:29.420 --> 13:31.410
Why did you put the kettle on the stove?!

13:31.460 --> 13:35.170
I don't remember doing that. I
may have turned the heat on.

13:35.220 --> 13:36.490
It's plastic!

13:36.540 --> 13:38.810
That's the way we used to boil water!

13:38.860 --> 13:41.410
That's my fault. I, I
think I left it on there.

13:41.460 --> 13:44.450
Oh, come on! To be fair,
Sheila did warn us about this.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.730
- Listen, you get off, love.
- Do I look all right?

13:46.780 --> 13:51.620
YES! You look lovely.
Just maybe wear a cardi.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.900
Hey. What are you up to?

14:00.100 --> 14:03.170
- Deleting all my social media.
- No.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.850
You can't let them get to you.

14:05.900 --> 14:08.210
Hm. Your hand?

14:08.260 --> 14:09.850
Oh...

14:09.900 --> 14:12.780
No, I just, erm, grazed it. It's nothing.

14:15.540 --> 14:18.490
Well, look, hopefully this
will be an end to it, eh?

14:18.540 --> 14:20.850
Oh. It doesn't even matter.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.620
I just hate the thought
of anybody looking at me.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.250
Come here.

14:27.300 --> 14:31.540
- Adam, stop, please. Sorry.
- No, no. It's all right.

14:40.820 --> 14:42.210
Have you heard from Ramona?

14:42.260 --> 14:44.770
Yeah, yeah. She emailed.
Her mother's not great.

14:44.820 --> 14:46.730
I think that's what it said.

14:46.780 --> 14:48.690
Typing leaves a lot to the imagination!

14:49.900 --> 14:51.810
Benjamin. Bang on time.

14:51.860 --> 14:55.370
Hang on. Let him stew a minute.

14:56.860 --> 14:59.570
- OK.
- Eh!

14:59.620 --> 15:00.970
Then a minute more.

15:01.020 --> 15:03.250
Learn this from one of
your books on management?

15:03.300 --> 15:04.490
Yeah, it's in all of them.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.570
Another tip, don't let him intimidate you.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.730
- He doesn't.
- I was talking to myself.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.290
- I haven't met the guy.
- Oh, he's a weasely little man.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.690
- Probably into S&M.
- Yes, that's good.

15:17.820 --> 15:21.890
Visualise him as ridiculous. Makes
it much easier to negotiate.

15:21.940 --> 15:22.930
OK.

15:39.620 --> 15:42.490
Benjamin, hi, sorry to leave
you standing on the doorstep.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.850
I was just on a call to New York.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.810
Isn't it the middle of the night there?

15:46.860 --> 15:49.860
Well, you know, city that
never sleeps and all that.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.330
This is David. He's going to be
sitting with us. My ex-husband.

16:02.380 --> 16:05.610
- Why?
- Isn't that a bit personal?

16:05.660 --> 16:09.370
- We just drifted apart, didn't we?
- No, why is he joining us?

16:09.420 --> 16:11.410
I'm acting as Karen's financial advisor.

16:11.460 --> 16:12.810
Not that she needs it.

16:12.860 --> 16:16.770
Anyone with an ounce of savvy can
see what a success she's making.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.020
Shall we?

16:33.180 --> 16:36.010
Adam, I'm gonna see it at some point!

16:36.060 --> 16:38.210
You don't want to.

16:38.260 --> 16:41.090
Watch your girlfriend
have sex with my husband?

16:41.140 --> 16:42.490
Yeah, too right, I don't!

16:42.540 --> 16:45.810
But if others have seen it, I need to.

16:45.860 --> 16:46.980
OK.

16:48.380 --> 16:50.650
Oh, er, you may want to turn it down.

16:53.660 --> 16:56.620
- Can I have two flat whites, please?
- Comin' up.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.290
How's Tina taken it?

17:09.339 --> 17:13.609
Badly. She feels violated.

17:13.660 --> 17:17.060
- I'm sorry.
- Jeez, it's not your fault!

17:18.060 --> 17:19.260
Nor yours!

17:20.460 --> 17:22.819
We're collateral damage.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.380
Come on.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.810
The issues in your private
life are compromising

17:35.860 --> 17:37.930
your ability to do your job!

17:37.980 --> 17:41.250
I was under pressure. It's under control.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.010
Anyway, with respect,
it's none of your business.

17:44.060 --> 17:46.930
It is when it's affecting business.

17:46.980 --> 17:51.850
The company needs firm leadership.
Someone must exert control.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.580
Crack the whip. Instil some discipline.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.290
And that would be you, would it?

18:00.140 --> 18:03.970
Since you have no plan to address
the firm's financial woes.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.970
The woes, as you call them, are temporary.

18:06.020 --> 18:07.170
If you, or your backer,

18:07.220 --> 18:10.610
would inject a little more capital
to tide us over, all will be well.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.810
No, I'm dissolving the partnership.

18:12.860 --> 18:15.810
Under the terms of our agreement,
I shall buy out your shares.

18:15.860 --> 18:19.250
I have the option to buy you out first!

18:19.300 --> 18:22.490
You can't afford to, unless
you have savings stashed away.

18:22.540 --> 18:25.930
No, I don't. I'll find
an alternative investor.

18:25.980 --> 18:29.570
Under our terms you have a
week so, good luck with that.

18:29.620 --> 18:31.860
I'll see myself out.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.300
Well...

18:35.500 --> 18:38.770
I suppose you could ask Eddie Zubayer.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.090
He'd do it as a favour.

18:40.140 --> 18:43.010
No, that's why I wouldn't.
What about venture capital?

18:43.060 --> 18:46.370
- They'd want their pound of flesh.
- They can, as long as I keep control.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.580
I'll make a few calls.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.890
Was it, like, full-on, full-blown?

18:55.940 --> 18:57.770
Did he have any equipment?

18:57.820 --> 19:01.050
Excruciating. Imagine, Jen, if it was you?

19:01.100 --> 19:02.570
Awful!

19:02.620 --> 19:04.050
- Yes.
- She's seen it.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.130
- Oh, don't.
- She's devastated.

19:06.180 --> 19:09.250
- I heard it was really explicit.
- But imagine...

19:09.300 --> 19:12.130
Those are the questions people
are probably asking... Hello!

19:12.180 --> 19:13.810
- Hey!
- Hey!

19:13.860 --> 19:16.930
Don't be late if you don't
want people talking about ya.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.090
- Don't think so!
- Are you sure you weren't?

19:20.140 --> 19:23.530
Ugh, it's all right.
You and everybody else.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.090
Obviously we've all heard about
it, but I haven't seen it.

19:27.140 --> 19:31.130
Me neither. I mean, I was
tempted. But, hey, I've been busy.

19:31.180 --> 19:33.010
- It's on my list.
- We're not going to.

19:33.060 --> 19:34.330
- We're not?
- No.

19:34.380 --> 19:37.250
No. No way. Sisterhood.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.450
Anyway, hasn't it been taken down?

19:39.500 --> 19:42.450
Yeah, but it's the Internet.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.410
These things never really disappear.
It could resurface in 20 years.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.850
By that time, I could have a
child old enough to see it.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.450
Don't worry, you'll look completely
different by then. We all do.

19:52.500 --> 19:57.730
- Anyway, you shouldn't feel ashamed.
- I know I shouldn't, but I do.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.810
But I'm angry because I feel ashamed.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.930
I don't know what to do with that.

20:01.980 --> 20:06.570
I'm SO paranoid. I keep looking
at people thinking they know.

20:06.620 --> 20:07.930
Listen, if they do know,

20:07.980 --> 20:10.850
their looks will only be
because they are WELL jealous.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.530
They'll just wish their
sex lives were that good.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.980
Yeah. Or that they had one at all.

20:17.180 --> 20:18.970
Have you ever made a sex tape?

20:19.020 --> 20:22.290
No, I don't see the point.
Why watch it if you can do it?

20:22.340 --> 20:24.770
I don't even like watching
film stars having sex.

20:24.820 --> 20:27.530
- Why would I want to
watch myself? - Quite.

20:27.580 --> 20:29.650
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.420
You're being unusually reticent.

20:37.660 --> 20:38.770
We did once.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.170
- No!
- What, you and Jen?

20:40.220 --> 20:43.170
Yeah. Did it when they were all the rage.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.530
Since when have sex
tapes been all the rage?

20:45.580 --> 20:47.650
Since that Kardashian girl. Was it Kim?

20:47.700 --> 20:50.250
Or Kendall or Kanye. One
of them sisters, yeah.

20:50.300 --> 20:53.370
- Was it any good?
- We gave it a go.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.650
- (There ya go.)
- Mm?

20:55.700 --> 20:57.690
- Give it to me baby.
- Woof.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.650
Let's go. Fruits.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.450
All right.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.530
Ah!

21:03.580 --> 21:04.610
- Ow!
- Sorry.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.770
Hot chilli sauce. Phew.

21:07.820 --> 21:11.850
Oi! I'm not getting that
in my crevices. No way.

21:15.660 --> 21:17.010
Oh!

21:20.940 --> 21:22.900
Ahh, ooh.

21:24.420 --> 21:26.580
Ahh! Ooh!

21:28.660 --> 21:31.210
- Whoa!
- Aw, what is the date on that?!

21:34.420 --> 21:37.330
- I feel sick.
- Certainly dulled my appetite.

21:40.340 --> 21:43.010
I felt sexier taking the
bins out to be honest.

21:43.060 --> 21:45.210
Are you gonna to report
Jamie to the police?

21:45.260 --> 21:48.900
Have more men ogling over it? Nope.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.060
I'd just be happy with an apology.

22:15.260 --> 22:16.940
Ah. Hi.

22:20.020 --> 22:22.650
- Listen --
- What's happened to your lip?

22:24.700 --> 22:26.820
Well, your boyfriend hit me.

22:31.980 --> 22:32.980
Hi.

22:36.460 --> 22:39.220
You didn't tell me you went to see Jamie.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.650
You didn't tell me you were planning to.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.810
I can fight my own battles. I don't
need you wading in with both fists.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.930
- I only hit him once.
- So, you admit it?

22:47.980 --> 22:50.490
He was goading me, about your sex life.

22:50.540 --> 22:54.490
- It's got nothing to do with you.
- Your sex life?! I think it has.

22:54.540 --> 22:58.330
- Why did you want to go and see him?
- I didn't. He owes me an apology.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.570
That's why I went. Did you get one?

23:00.620 --> 23:03.770
He says he didn't post the tape online.

23:03.820 --> 23:06.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. You
just think he's innocent?

23:06.900 --> 23:10.650
I don't know, but I do know
that you're guilty of assault.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.690
I can't believe that you did that.

23:12.740 --> 23:15.410
OK, OK. I accept I shouldn't have done it.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.530
I'll apologise. I'll send him flowers.

23:17.580 --> 23:19.530
How do you even know where he lives?

23:19.580 --> 23:22.290
Let's not forget who the
bad guy is here, huh?

23:22.340 --> 23:25.170
He's trying to drive a wedge between us.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.940
Thanks to you, Adam, he's succeeded.

23:28.940 --> 23:32.380
I was doing it for you! He humiliated you!

23:37.780 --> 23:39.850
No, he didn't.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.690
Because I won't allow him to.

23:42.740 --> 23:46.010
We were both consenting adults.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.020
I think I look great.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.650
I'm not ashamed.

23:50.700 --> 23:54.220
And I won't have anybody telling
me that I should feel otherwise.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.100
You included.

24:19.740 --> 24:23.090
That's the only venture capitalist
who'd see us. I'm sorry, Karen.

24:23.140 --> 24:26.250
- I feel I've let you down.
- No, you did your best, David.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.780
- Should we go for some coffee?
- Yeah.

24:29.780 --> 24:31.700
THEIRS was crap.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.940
One introduction.

24:37.580 --> 24:40.610
I know my name doesn't carry
much weight in the city any more.

24:40.660 --> 24:44.130
"Remanded in custody"
tends to do that for you.

24:44.180 --> 24:47.210
Venture capitalists are like the
vampires of the business world.

24:47.260 --> 24:48.930
They should be baying for new blood.

24:48.980 --> 24:53.010
The problem wasn't yours, David.
It was mine, or at least my idea.

24:53.060 --> 24:54.730
What was it he said?

24:54.780 --> 24:58.130
"No-one reads any more, unless the
words are preceded with a hashtag."

24:58.180 --> 25:01.290
- Waa, waa, waa.
- I could've punched him in the face.

25:01.340 --> 25:04.810
"Remanded in custody twice."
That'd look even better on your CV.

25:06.760 --> 25:07.930
So, there we are then.

25:07.980 --> 25:10.330
Oh, I'm not beaten yet, David.

25:10.380 --> 25:14.530
The smarmy little git's
only stiffened my resolve.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.090
I'm not sure you have
that many options left.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.530
If not the vampires, then the vultures.

25:20.580 --> 25:23.050
The banks. I'm going
to re-mortgage my house.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.890
- Karen, don't!
- Don't you believe in me?

25:24.940 --> 25:26.770
This is my business, David.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.900
I'm not just gonna give it to Benjamin.

25:41.300 --> 25:43.370
I don't want to!

25:43.420 --> 25:45.970
Listen, you have to
share with your brother.

25:46.020 --> 25:47.770
- I can't sleep on the floor.
- Why not?

25:47.820 --> 25:50.120
I keep thinking spiders
will crawl in my mouth!

25:51.120 --> 25:53.370
Adam, swap with your sister.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.130
- You take the floor.
- In my own room?

25:55.180 --> 25:57.410
I don't want to sleep
in his bed. Disgusting!

25:58.580 --> 26:02.060
- Goodnight, everyone.
- Goodnight, Barbara.

26:03.420 --> 26:06.570
- Can't I stay at a friend's house?
- It's 11:00 at night!

26:06.620 --> 26:09.690
Tomorrow then, AND for
the rest of my life!

26:09.740 --> 26:12.020
OK. Here's what we're gonna do.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.370
Can't I sleep in your bed?

26:21.420 --> 26:23.820
Mum says I need the sleep for school.

26:28.100 --> 26:31.170
Suppose Aunt Sheila doesn't
come back from Canada?

26:31.220 --> 26:34.020
- Will Gran have to live with us?
- Oh...

26:35.060 --> 26:37.090
You don't much like
having her here, do you?

26:37.140 --> 26:38.770
I mean, I do love her.

26:38.820 --> 26:40.490
You and me both.

26:40.540 --> 26:44.690
The bit about having her here.
Obviously, I love her, too.

26:44.740 --> 26:46.570
But, God, when you're my age,

26:46.620 --> 26:49.130
you don't want your crabby
old mum living with ya.

26:49.180 --> 26:53.140
- When do you think she might go home?
- It's not that simple.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.570
I'm sure you've noticed that your
grandma is going a bit batty.

26:58.620 --> 27:00.170
- The kettle on the stove?
- Yeah.

27:00.220 --> 27:02.770
- That was an accident.
- It could've burnt the house down.

27:02.820 --> 27:06.530
Can't she have someone live
with her? She'd like that.

27:06.580 --> 27:09.170
Maybe. That's an option.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.410
Just, just bear with us, all right?

27:11.460 --> 27:16.570
Once it's clear if she needs
help, then, we'll get it sorted.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.220
Isn't it clear yet?

27:19.380 --> 27:21.820
Come on. Girls need their beauty sleep.

27:23.180 --> 27:25.290
You'd better get a lie-in tomorrow then.

27:25.340 --> 27:27.860
Hey! I'll make you sleep
with your grandma.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.540
So, what progress have you made?

27:38.820 --> 27:42.090
Has my former accountant admitted
to being a thieving toerag?

27:42.140 --> 27:45.730
Well, Danny maintains it
was a misunderstanding.

27:45.780 --> 27:48.970
Which, because of the opacity
of the documentation,

27:49.020 --> 27:52.690
and as a gesture of goodwill, I've
chosen to accept at face value.

27:52.740 --> 27:55.930
I want it all repaid. With interest.

27:55.980 --> 27:59.050
I'm sorry, George. I don't have it.

27:59.100 --> 28:03.090
George, you made expectations clear
when you asked me to handle this.

28:03.140 --> 28:07.250
Fortunately as part of my MBA,
I specialised in mediation,

28:07.300 --> 28:10.490
and I can tell you that we're
very close to agreeing terms.

28:10.540 --> 28:14.090
All of it, with interest, now.

28:14.140 --> 28:16.650
If I could, I would, honest!

28:16.700 --> 28:21.410
George, as I said, I'm a
highly-skilled negotiator.

28:21.460 --> 28:24.210
I've had a bit of training, too.

28:24.260 --> 28:26.410
Pass me that book with
the big words in it.

28:26.460 --> 28:28.810
- The thesaurus?
- Yeah.

28:28.860 --> 28:34.380
In my experience, it's all about
finding the right argument.

28:35.820 --> 28:37.890
Ooh!

28:42.980 --> 28:45.970
Pay me my money, you
thieving bastard, by Friday,

28:46.020 --> 28:47.580
or you're dead.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.220
Add on the cost of dry-cleaning the rug...

28:52.220 --> 28:53.530
.. and get him out of here.

29:16.980 --> 29:19.170
I'm not sure I'm talking to you.

29:19.220 --> 29:22.370
- I'm calling to say I'm sorry.
- Don't like falling out.

29:22.420 --> 29:26.810
It's my fault. You know, I shouldn't
have gone to see Jamie, or hit him.

29:26.860 --> 29:29.490
Although he does have the
sort of face that invites it.

29:29.540 --> 29:31.700
I might have mentioned I was seeing him.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.290
Suppose I knew you wouldn't be happy.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.890
From now on, let's just
tell each other everything.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.370
Yeah. No secrets.

29:39.420 --> 29:41.210
- No lies.
- Yeah.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.100
- See you tonight.
- Can't wait.

29:47.300 --> 29:48.860
Do you fancy lunch?

29:50.340 --> 29:54.570
Erm, no, I've got a load on
here. I, I should eat at my desk.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.580
- OK. See you later.
- Yeah.

30:01.220 --> 30:04.220
- Nikki.
- David. Come in.

30:05.580 --> 30:06.930
George isn't here.

30:06.980 --> 30:09.690
I know. I was hiding up the
road waiting for him to leave.

30:09.740 --> 30:11.850
I was with him earlier. He attacked Danny!

30:11.900 --> 30:13.300
There was blood everywhere!

30:14.580 --> 30:16.900
That's how you got the bruises, isn't it?

30:19.020 --> 30:22.210
- You haven't had a nose
job, have you? - I have.

30:22.260 --> 30:25.940
Well, if you have, it was
reconstructive, not cosmetic.

30:27.180 --> 30:28.900
Oh, my God! George beats you.

30:29.940 --> 30:31.540
No, he doesn't.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.370
He hit me. It's not a regular thing.

30:35.420 --> 30:37.180
Hit you?

30:39.420 --> 30:41.220
Must've been a fist to do that damage.

30:42.580 --> 30:45.740
He didn't believe I was
opening a nail bar.

30:46.780 --> 30:48.690
If you'd have told him it was a wine bar

30:48.740 --> 30:50.740
I might have been able
to get away with it.

30:51.900 --> 30:55.810
- I just wasn't convincing.
- I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

30:55.860 --> 30:58.020
Typical man, thinks it's all about him.

31:00.180 --> 31:04.370
He found out I was making provision
in case I ever want to leave him.

31:04.420 --> 31:05.860
Because of the beatings?

31:07.340 --> 31:10.380
Yes, of course, but also...

31:12.740 --> 31:14.650
I'm bored, David.

31:14.700 --> 31:16.730
Our kids have left home.

31:16.780 --> 31:19.370
I rattle about this house.
It's like a mausoleum.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.610
If, if it wasn't for the
charities I'm involved with,

31:22.660 --> 31:25.570
I'm not sure I'd be getting
out of bed every morning.

31:25.620 --> 31:27.970
Nikki, you have to leave him!

31:28.020 --> 31:30.210
Have you decided I'm
your charitable cause?

31:30.260 --> 31:35.170
I care about you. I would
for anyone in your position.

31:36.260 --> 31:37.490
Nik!

31:37.540 --> 31:38.730
Don't. It's fine.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.380
Nik, where are ya?!

31:45.220 --> 31:46.250
George.

31:46.300 --> 31:49.290
David. I didn't see your car.

31:49.340 --> 31:52.740
Yeah, it's in the road. I realised
I'd left my phone in your study.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.540
Right, well, I'll be off then.

32:08.140 --> 32:10.770
I'm sure I left my phone on here!

32:10.820 --> 32:12.890
Why don't you call it?

32:12.940 --> 32:16.010
How can I? It's my phone I'm looking for!

32:16.060 --> 32:19.210
Here. You're in my contacts
under 'Nuisance Call'.

32:19.260 --> 32:22.490
Well, I know I'm not under 'recent calls'.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.420
You're living with us, Mum!

32:28.900 --> 32:30.530
She's getting worse, I swear.

32:30.580 --> 32:34.370
What, cos she's lost her
phone? You do it all the time.

32:34.420 --> 32:38.010
It's OK. You're in denial.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.260
Found it.

32:58.260 --> 33:01.770
It's Jenny! Who do you think it is?

33:02.720 --> 33:04.820
Phone in the fridge. Just sayin'.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.410
An 'A'!

33:13.460 --> 33:16.170
Oh, I'm really pleased for
you, Olivia, well done.

33:16.220 --> 33:19.770
I'm determined to get good
grades, Mum, now more than ever.

33:20.900 --> 33:22.370
I got 300 likes.

33:22.420 --> 33:23.730
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

33:23.780 --> 33:26.050
- Have you had your essay back?
- Yeah.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.490
Well, you sound happy.

33:27.540 --> 33:30.290
My profile picture's got 300 likes.

33:30.340 --> 33:32.850
Well, that's an achievement of sorts.

33:32.900 --> 33:35.130
Nice.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.130
Are you taking out a mortgage?

33:37.180 --> 33:39.210
Well, I've been offered one.

33:39.260 --> 33:44.090
It would enable me to buy my
business back, but it's a big risk.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.530
We could end up homeless.

33:45.580 --> 33:47.290
I'll be at uni soon.

33:47.340 --> 33:50.370
And I've no shortage of
friends I could stay with.

33:50.420 --> 33:53.610
Mum, you always told
us to follow our dreams.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.730
Just cos you're old doesn't
mean you shouldn't.

33:56.780 --> 33:58.260
Thanks, girls.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.250
Sorry to interrupt.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.650
Excuse me.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.420
Can I give you a word of advice?

34:21.580 --> 34:22.570
Now?

34:22.620 --> 34:24.370
I'm not sure you're doing that right.

34:24.420 --> 34:26.650
Not hearing any complaints.

34:26.699 --> 34:29.330
You haven't heard me make
any noises though, have ya?

34:29.380 --> 34:31.530
- What?
- Perhaps I could help.

34:31.580 --> 34:35.010
I do have a little more
experience than you... with Tina.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.690
Possibly overall. Doesn't matter.

34:37.739 --> 34:40.770
Correct me if I'm wrong, but erm...

34:40.820 --> 34:43.730
Tina likes a little bit more confidence.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.610
Be a bit more forward.

34:45.659 --> 34:47.730
But at the same time holding back.

34:47.780 --> 34:51.010
- Except with your
follow through. - Yeah.

34:51.060 --> 34:55.409
Oh, and, what IS that thing
you do with your hips?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.170
My hips?

34:57.220 --> 35:00.250
Yeah, we're gonna need to iron
out that kink in your game.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.970
It's not my golf swing
we're talking about!

35:03.020 --> 35:05.010
Would it be easier if I showed you?

35:05.060 --> 35:07.660
Oh. I think so.

35:15.540 --> 35:16.480
Yeah, baby!

35:19.980 --> 35:20.590
No.

35:23.740 --> 35:25.140
Is everything all right?

35:29.340 --> 35:32.300
Jesus, Adam. Is this about the video?

35:34.180 --> 35:37.130
I've put it behind me. Why can't you?

35:37.180 --> 35:39.810
You don't make those noises with me.

35:39.860 --> 35:42.610
Matt is across the hall! And David.

35:42.660 --> 35:44.210
But you never have!

35:47.220 --> 35:50.500
It's just different... with you.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.260
Worse?

35:55.020 --> 35:56.690
Better?

35:56.740 --> 35:58.300
Different.

36:00.060 --> 36:02.860
Adam, please. Come on.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.420
- Just forget about it.
- No.

36:11.260 --> 36:13.340
I don't think I can.

36:26.220 --> 36:29.500
Well, I have to admit, it is affecting me.

36:30.700 --> 36:34.690
The thought of my girlfriend
having sex with another man.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.570
My husband?

36:36.620 --> 36:38.380
It's tormenting me.

36:39.580 --> 36:41.580
I think she might prefer him...

36:43.140 --> 36:44.850
.. in THAT way.

36:44.900 --> 36:47.770
You're complaining to ME
that you think my husband

36:47.820 --> 36:50.130
is better in bed with your
girlfriend than you are?

36:50.180 --> 36:53.090
I don't know what to tell you, Adam.

36:53.140 --> 36:56.490
I don't have the breadth
of her experience.

36:56.540 --> 36:58.820
I can't compare and contrast.

37:00.740 --> 37:03.850
You shouldn't worry. He's not all that.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.450
I knew he wasn't.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.010
Anyway, that's twice she's
chosen you over him.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.780
- Twice?
- Yeah.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.020
When you two first got together
and again a few weeks ago.

37:15.460 --> 37:17.290
No, er, erm...

37:17.340 --> 37:21.170
- I know she saw him last week.
- No, no, this was before that.

37:21.220 --> 37:24.370
When she chose you, Jamie
came crawling back to me.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.450
I agreed to try and make another go of it.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.650
And we did. Try.

37:29.700 --> 37:30.970
Well, at least, I did.

37:31.020 --> 37:33.690
The beginning of last month he announces,

37:33.740 --> 37:37.500
quite out of the blue,
that he can't get over her.

37:38.860 --> 37:41.770
So he goes to see her,
begs her to take him back.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.460
She sends him packing.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.850
I'm not gonna give him a third chance.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.130
I'm not that crazy.

37:49.180 --> 37:52.890
So I kicked him out, once and for all.

37:52.940 --> 37:56.060
I imagine that's why he posted the clip.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.060
He wanted to hurt her.

38:00.540 --> 38:03.460
And he's hurt you, too.

38:08.340 --> 38:11.520
I've never seen an otter
doing sit-ups before.

38:13.660 --> 38:15.890
You wanna get your dad
doing a few of those!

38:15.940 --> 38:17.690
Er...

38:24.500 --> 38:26.460
I... I'm gonna have to call you back.

38:28.620 --> 38:31.290
Have you left the bath running?

38:31.340 --> 38:33.010
Mum!

38:33.060 --> 38:35.090
Oh, my God!

38:35.140 --> 38:38.730
- David. What are you doing here?
- Aren't you meeting Benjamin?

38:38.780 --> 38:40.330
You ought to have me in your corner.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.650
Wouldn't put it past him
for trying something on.

38:42.700 --> 38:45.900
Yes, if I ever need a reference,
I'll remember not to come to you.

38:52.340 --> 38:55.210
So, if I could just have your signature.

38:55.260 --> 38:58.410
Hang on. Hang on. I'm sorry.
I'm a bit off the pace here.

38:58.460 --> 39:01.330
- My assessment the last time we met.
- You've raised the money?

39:01.380 --> 39:03.490
I told you I was gonna
ask the bank for a loan.

39:03.540 --> 39:07.090
- I didn't think they'd give you one!
- They must have confidence in me.

39:07.140 --> 39:08.490
Or the value of this house!

39:08.540 --> 39:12.060
If you'd have your domestic on
your own time, I'd like to get on.

39:13.180 --> 39:14.970
David!

39:15.020 --> 39:19.370
That is so childish! We'll
just print another one.

39:19.420 --> 39:21.090
You're paying too much.

39:21.140 --> 39:23.140
He wouldn't give you this for your share.

39:24.420 --> 39:27.890
Well, no, because Karen herself
wouldn't be part of the deal.

39:27.940 --> 39:29.530
She'll give you half.

39:29.580 --> 39:34.570
Alternatively, we restructure the
company based on your valuation.

39:34.620 --> 39:38.370
Each reduce your share to a third,
and I become an equal partner.

39:38.420 --> 39:40.490
Why would you do that?

39:40.540 --> 39:43.050
I need to do something
with my divorce settlement.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.130
I thought you wanted to buy somewhere.

39:45.180 --> 39:46.610
It'll take a little longer,

39:46.660 --> 39:49.650
but repay my faith in you,
and I'll buy something bigger.

39:49.700 --> 39:52.690
Well, at that price I'd
be a fool not to accept,

39:52.740 --> 39:55.770
especially if Karen no
longer has a majority share.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.100
Thank you, David.

40:04.340 --> 40:07.370
And, erm... Might I move
in with you for a bit?

40:07.420 --> 40:11.050
It's a bit awkward at Adam and Tina's
ever since the whole porn thing.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.260
Oh, dear Lord!

40:16.620 --> 40:19.170
'You have one new message.

40:19.220 --> 40:21.050
'First new message.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.970
'Hiya, it's me.

40:23.020 --> 40:25.530
Full disclosure, I'm going to see Jamie.

40:25.580 --> 40:27.810
Apparently, he has something to tell me.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.530
I'll be home shortly.

You're thinking the worst.
You've got it in for her!

40:57.860 --> 41:00.610
I'm trying to do the right
thing! Don't attack me.

41:00.660 --> 41:04.410
- I'm not the one with the problem!
- No, I am. I have to live with ya.

41:04.460 --> 41:08.330
OK. Right. Number one, she
almost set fire to the house.

41:08.380 --> 41:12.210
- Two, she nearly caused a flood.
- No, nearly. Almost.

41:12.260 --> 41:14.490
But, Pete, I think she's lost the plot!

41:14.540 --> 41:16.370
She's just a little bit forgetful.

41:16.420 --> 41:18.890
I see far worse in the home, every day.

41:18.940 --> 41:21.010
Well, God forgive me,

41:21.060 --> 41:25.130
but maybe that's where she belongs
before she hurts herself or us!

41:26.620 --> 41:29.890
- Pete, please.
- Oh, I don't know!

41:29.940 --> 41:31.810
Maybe I could make some enquiries.

41:31.860 --> 41:33.570
Wait! What?

41:33.620 --> 41:36.250
You said Gran could have
someone living with her.

41:36.300 --> 41:39.690
Look, love, we think she needs
more help than we realised.

41:39.740 --> 41:42.290
But that wasn't her fault.
It wasn't her, it was me.

41:42.340 --> 41:43.780
Wait, what was?

41:45.780 --> 41:49.170
I hid her phone in the fridge.

41:49.220 --> 41:51.690
Distracted her while she
was running her bath.

41:51.740 --> 41:55.330
- There's an even better one, please!
- Oh, all right.

41:55.380 --> 41:58.890
And you did all this to make
Gran look like she was doo-lally?

41:58.940 --> 42:02.090
Do you know how much
trouble you're in right now?

42:02.140 --> 42:04.690
You've just been such a
grump since she arrived.

42:04.740 --> 42:08.450
I just thought if she went back home
we could go back to the way we were.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.090
- And you'd get your old room back?
- That, too.

42:11.140 --> 42:14.090
But I never meant for her to be
put in a home! She'd hate that.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.850
Chloe, love, 24-hour
care is very expensive.

42:16.900 --> 42:19.490
We'd have to sell the
blinking house to pay for it.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.530
Well, then I'd rather she stayed with us.

42:21.580 --> 42:22.770
Oh, Go...

42:22.820 --> 42:24.770
Oh, Mum!

42:24.820 --> 42:27.290
I thought you were losing it.

42:27.340 --> 42:30.490
I think I must be. I've
lost my phone again.

42:30.540 --> 42:32.290
Don't worry about it.

42:32.340 --> 42:33.810
Here, Barbara.

42:33.860 --> 42:37.850
Go on, have a sit down. Have a cup of tea.

42:37.900 --> 42:41.020
Here you go. And a biscuit.

42:43.920 --> 42:44.800
What?

42:46.620 --> 42:49.130
- Chloe?
- Sorry.

42:49.180 --> 42:52.580
Looks like you're staying with us, Gran!

43:08.160 --> 43:09.500
[Thanks for seeing me.]

43:12.100 --> 43:15.490
- Adam, what are you doing here?
- You said you'd be home shortly.

43:15.540 --> 43:17.810
- Yeah.
- That was two hours ago.

43:17.860 --> 43:20.920
- Keeps you on a tight leash, does he?
- Fuck up or I'll smack you again.

43:20.970 --> 43:22.530
- I'm ready this time.
- Really?

43:22.580 --> 43:24.250
Pack it in, the pair of ya!

43:24.300 --> 43:26.450
I know he's trying to get back with you!

43:26.500 --> 43:28.530
- What? - That's why
he wanted to see you!

43:28.580 --> 43:30.530
I realised how the tape
might have got out.

43:30.580 --> 43:32.970
- Yeah, you posted it!
- No, he didn't!

43:33.020 --> 43:35.010
Years ago he shared it with his mate.

43:35.060 --> 43:38.130
Yeah, I shouldn't have. I'm
sorry. I apologise again.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.730
That doesn't take two hours to say!

43:39.780 --> 43:42.810
You lied. You didn't tell me you
saw him before we moved in together.

43:42.860 --> 43:46.090
- How do you know that?
- Well, I didn't tell him.

43:46.140 --> 43:48.820
- No, no. Sarah did!
- Sarah?

43:50.820 --> 43:54.250
Adam, how do you know Jamie's wife?

43:54.300 --> 43:56.860
We work together. She's
the other grown-up.

43:57.900 --> 43:59.250
Oh, boy.

43:59.300 --> 44:01.090
- You didn't tell me.
- You didn't tell me!

44:01.140 --> 44:03.490
- You two sure you're suited...?
- Shut it, you!

44:03.540 --> 44:06.540
- Why have you been here so long!?
- We were saying goodbye!

44:07.860 --> 44:10.500
I told him I didn't want to see him again.

44:11.500 --> 44:14.860
Well, good. Now you've done
that, we can go. Come on.

44:20.180 --> 44:21.420
You can.

44:26.020 --> 44:29.530
- I'll come when I'm ready.
- What?

44:29.580 --> 44:31.420
Off you go.
