WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.214
Previously, on "Below Deck
Mediterranean"...

00:07.257 --> 00:08.591
Oh, that's too adorable.

00:08.633 --> 00:09.592
They're, like, so cute.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.511
Oh!

00:11.553 --> 00:12.721
How was your dinner?

00:12.762 --> 00:14.472
Oh, my gosh, it worked
out really well.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.141
It was so magical.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.351
Mathew has not had any
complaints about the food.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.812
Mathew's problem is Mathew.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.440
I wanna finish with
the crew I start with.

00:23.481 --> 00:27.360
So, I'm gonna trust you
to finish the season out.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.653
-Yeah, all right.
-That means the world to me.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.280
I get to stay!

00:30.321 --> 00:31.281
-Thank you.
-Of course.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.615
I'll have you on lates.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.534
I do wanna rotate.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.620
I struggle with loving people
after they've really crossed me.

00:39.664 --> 00:40.623
Of, like, human names on there?

00:40.665 --> 00:42.167
-Yes.
-Oh!

00:42.208 --> 00:43.543
They're gonna see
my success one day

00:43.585 --> 00:44.544
and wish they were nice to me.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.379
David, Malia.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.757
If you want, you can go to
the bridge with Captain Sandy.

00:48.798 --> 00:51.134
Yeah, copy,
heading up there now.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.721
It's definitely a new dynamic,
being attracted to my boss.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.270
That's fine.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.271
Savage!

01:03.313 --> 01:05.273
At least I got my answer, right?

01:07.150 --> 01:08.401
I came from a situation
where it was,

01:08.443 --> 01:10.195
like, a toxic work relationship.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.322
Like, the most stressful
situation of my life.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.583
David, Babe, who cares?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.339
The guys that we have on deck,

01:29.381 --> 01:30.882
they aren't those sh--bag guys.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.300
-They... they love me.
-They love you.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.638
-I love you.
-Thank you.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.286
-Mm, I love you.
-Thank you.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.248
Did the music stop?

02:03.289 --> 02:04.499
Where is Z and Courtney?

02:04.541 --> 02:05.875
Oh!

02:08.837 --> 02:10.380
Oh, go, because I have
to pee as well.

02:10.422 --> 02:11.756
Someone's phone is there.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.800
My ass is wet as [bleep].

02:13.842 --> 02:15.635
-Bedtime?
-Mm-hmm.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.636
What are you eating?

02:16.678 --> 02:17.637
Chips.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.722
I got you two snack bars.

02:18.763 --> 02:19.764
No.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.812
Are you joking?

02:25.854 --> 02:26.813
-No, man...
-Shall I?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.273
Yeah, I think you should.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.733
-Yeah. Meh.
-Yeah.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.237
I'm being a massive...

02:37.449 --> 02:38.658
Where's your meatloaf at?

02:38.700 --> 02:40.285
Okay.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.619
I'm gonna go to bed.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.620
-Okay.
-Don't mind her, she's...

02:42.662 --> 02:43.663
Ugh!

02:44.789 --> 02:46.499
Eh. Meh.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.668
Uh-hum.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.669
Courtney.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.670
Mm-hmm?

02:50.712 --> 02:51.713
You jump into your bunk.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.009
Ooh, ugh.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.345
Just climb up,
and you'll be fine.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.721
Go to your bunk,
have a good sleep.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.851
[bleep]

03:04.893 --> 03:06.019
Ow!

03:06.061 --> 03:08.646
Sh--.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.815
Why, what is going on?

03:12.609 --> 03:14.235
Trying to be a ----ing hero.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.447
I had meatloaf.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.910
Here's some water, right here.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.953
She passed out.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.373
I hope she sleeps well.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.333
Go to bed,
you ----ing drunkards.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.468
[laughing]

03:41.721 --> 03:43.723
Ugh... oh!

03:43.765 --> 03:45.558
I know, I ----ing know,
I know.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.477
Courtney got sick in the night.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.946
And vomited all over my bed.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.743
My head hurts.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.037
Oh, this is so gross.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.624
-Oh, boo!
-Yeah.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.625
I mean it, hey?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.502
Yeah.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.713
I shared a lot of sh-- that
I haven't shared with people

04:14.754 --> 04:17.007
that would be
considered my close friends.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.008
I feel like a fool.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.968
Don't.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.470
I don't think I've been in a
setting with a group of people

04:22.512 --> 04:24.931
where I've ever felt this
comfortable before in my life,

04:24.973 --> 04:28.643
so it's pretty overwhelming.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.603
Yeah, I was
pretty boozed, whoa.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.647
I don't think
I'm as hungover as you guys.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.568
Meh.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.902
I feel like sh--.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.541
Oh!

04:55.795 --> 04:57.881
Apparently I kissed Mzi again.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.466
It was not me, it was Chloe.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.801
Chloe and Mav,
they have a thing.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.094
I'm really scared.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.846
The tequila
definitely takes over.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.643
-You have what?
-Beer fear.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.978
-Beer fear.
-Beer fear.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.355
-Good morning.
-Morning.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.356
How was your evening?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.815
-Good.
-Yeah?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.567
Better than last crew night out,
that's for sure.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.694
Nobody quit, so that's a plus.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.112
Oh, brother.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.367
Do you wanna start
on laundry today?

05:25.408 --> 05:26.618
Okay.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.994
Do you wanna go
straight up to master?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.913
We need to wipe
the flats

05:29.954 --> 05:32.040
and stainless back here,
vacuum here.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.750
You wanna do windows?

05:33.792 --> 05:36.127
Maybe David doesn't
remember asking me out,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.546
so I don't really wanna
bring it up at all.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.715
We can just slide that
one under the rug

05:40.757 --> 05:43.635
and move forward without
any awkwardness on deck.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.637
Let's do it, top to bottom.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.971
These robes are not nice.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.598
I always hated robes.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.934
Should we be, like,
three-start service

05:50.975 --> 05:53.144
and not give them ----ing robes?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.730
They keep using
these Goddamn robes.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.190
There's, like,
a few certain things,

05:57.232 --> 05:58.942
like, on a boat that
you can't stand.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.443
I always hated doing the bridge.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.986
Oh, I hate drying glasses.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.154
My, like, other chief stewardess

06:03.196 --> 06:04.823
used to make us do
a vinegar bath,

06:04.864 --> 06:06.866
so I always would stink
in front of guests, always.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.702
And I'm just like,
well, you know

06:08.743 --> 06:10.495
you're making us stink, right?

06:11.496 --> 06:12.539
Yeah.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.962
Classic.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.718
Katie, Mathew, Malia,
meet me in the crew mess

06:24.759 --> 06:26.469
<i>for charter number four</i>
<i>preference sheet meeting.</i>

06:26.511 --> 06:27.971
My headache's subsiding.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.809
-Oh.
-Oh [bleep].

06:36.813 --> 06:39.649
Jennifer and Patrick are
repeat charter guests

06:39.691 --> 06:42.736
who chartered with Captain Sandy
two years ago in France.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.529
Do you remember these guests?
Are they nice?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.072
They love to party.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.866
-Cheers.
-Cheers to the booze cruise.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.576
We're on a boat, mother----er.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.619
-Just the tip?
-Just the tip is all you need.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.538
-Mm!
-Nice.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.249
They hope the crew can
transform the boat

06:56.291 --> 06:58.543
into their own
Oktoberfest celebration.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.919
Yes!

06:59.961 --> 07:01.546
We need lederhosens.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.548
On day two, they would
like the yacht crew

07:03.590 --> 07:05.717
to put together a beer
games obstacle course.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.594
I think there's gonna be
a lot of beer on this boat.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.054
-Mentally prepare.
-Yes.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.098
Have to order some German
products, for sure.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.060
I'm so happy to be here,
and to get another chance.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.770
Plus, Oktoberfest food,
I'm confident with.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.189
In Rhode Island, we
have Oktoberfest in Newport,

07:19.230 --> 07:21.232
so I've dressed
in lederhosens before,

07:21.274 --> 07:24.944
I've had huge beers,
I've vomited in the street

07:24.986 --> 07:26.905
like drunk tourists
at Oktoberfest.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.031
-I've done it all.
-Okay.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.115
-Thank you.
-Sounds good.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.909
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.827
I like to think I've
lived a life without regrets,

07:32.869 --> 07:35.121
until last night.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.957
I was just wanting
to put in an order...

07:37.999 --> 07:40.585
anything you have
that's Oktoberfest-themed,

07:40.627 --> 07:41.878
we would happily take.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.089
Bratwurst, German sausages.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.007
Kegs of German beer.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.634
And soft pretzels.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.094
Perfect, thank you very much.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.554
All right, now gotta Google
some German recipes.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.556
Interior, interior, Katie.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.266
Can you meet me
in the main salon?

07:55.308 --> 07:58.061
Okay, so, this trip,
I'm gonna have you on lates.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.729
Yeah.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.648
I think this is a
good opportunity for you with

08:01.690 --> 08:04.234
service, because drunk guests
mean they don't notice anything.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.777
Woo!

08:05.819 --> 08:06.778
So, it will be good
for your confidence.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.154
Yeah, sure.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.989
Lexi, I'm gonna have
you on breakfasts,

08:10.031 --> 08:12.534
focusing on laundry
and housekeeping.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.744
Um, so yeah.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.079
Aces, thank you.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.998
-Let's do this.
-Let's rock.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.669
I don't want Katie to, like,
strip me off second stew

08:22.711 --> 08:25.005
and give Courtney
more second stew duties,

08:25.046 --> 08:27.674
just because
she doesn't like me.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.719
Plus, being a breakfast girl,
Mat's difficult to work with.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.887
Like, I am beyond pissed off.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.348
I hate this sh--.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.727
----ing irritating.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.103
Coming up...

08:40.145 --> 08:41.855
We drank 69 bottles of
booze in seven days.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.024
Oh, my God,
I need to order more alcohol.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.650
And later...

08:45.692 --> 08:46.860
Lexi was starting
our room earlier,

08:46.901 --> 08:48.236
and she never came back.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.237
-There's no towels.
-There isn't?

08:49.279 --> 08:51.072
No.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.784
I have to rely on Katie to be
able to navigate her stews.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.287
Now, if she can't, then
that's when I have to step in.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.798
Ah, we can move on down.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.804
How did you find last night?

09:14.846 --> 09:16.264
Got any closure with...

09:16.306 --> 09:18.683
Oh [bleep] yeah,
what happened?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.226
I let loose how
I'm feeling about Malia.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.942
It's not gonna happen.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.319
But I'm at a point where
I would like to be with someone

09:29.361 --> 09:31.112
that I can travel with
and I can grow with

09:31.154 --> 09:32.947
and I can develop with,

09:32.989 --> 09:37.702
as opposed to just having a girl
for the sake of having a girl.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.287
No, it was fine.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.288
Like, she's just, like,
I'm not playing the game.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.915
At least you went for it, bro.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.166
How good is it
having everything in the open?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.294
[laughing]

09:46.336 --> 09:48.672
One, two, three.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.760
All crew, provisions
are on the dock.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.970
Lexi, Lexi, can you please
bring up a drop sheet?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.347
Copy.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.682
Prawns in the freezer,
fishheads in the fridge.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.308
It's like a song.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.978
* Prawns in the freezer,
fishheads in the fridge *

10:04.020 --> 10:05.313
Oh, there's our costumes.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.314
Is there one more?

10:06.356 --> 10:07.315
That's it.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.234
Okay, cool.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.985
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>
<i>please get into your whites</i>

10:11.027 --> 10:12.362
<i>and let's meet on the dock</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

10:12.404 --> 10:13.405
Sweet.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.451
That looks beautiful.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.078
-Thank you.
-So does that.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.162
Thank you.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.497
Sandy's given me another chance,

10:22.539 --> 10:24.833
and no matter
what's thrown at me,

10:24.874 --> 10:26.710
I'm not gonna [bleep]
this up again.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.925
Is it calm enough for me to
take it off the dock today?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.845
Yeah, just come up and
I'll just let you have it.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.887
All right.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.725
It's a glorious day
to start a charter.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.024
Hi.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.150
Hi, Captain Sandy.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.818
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.111
Thank you, so good
to see you again.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.362
You too, welcome back.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.322
-Thank you.
-Thanks for coming back.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.907
-Hi.
-Thanks for having us back.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.534
-Hi, I'm Katie.
-Nice to meet you.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.785
-Hi, Katie.
-How you doing, Tanner.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.786
-This is Chad.
-Hi, Chad.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.040
-Hi, Chad.
-Hi, Chad.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.877
I see the "Alcohol, Now" tops,
I'm like, "Hells, yeah."

11:08.918 --> 11:11.338
And then I'm like, oh
[bleep] I'm on service.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.090
So, Katie, our chief stew,
is going to show you

11:14.132 --> 11:15.258
around the boat,
and we're gonna take off

11:15.300 --> 11:16.509
to your first anchorage.

11:16.551 --> 11:17.802
-Awesome, thank you.
-Perfect.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.223
-Hello, welcome aboard.
-Thank you so much.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.224
Which one's the fullest?

11:23.266 --> 11:24.267
I'm just kidding.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.272
-Cheers.
-Boom.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.857
Should we do a tour of the boat?

11:30.899 --> 11:32.108
Yeah, let's do it.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.152
So, this is our sundeck.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.072
As you see here, we have
a very large Jacuzzi.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.281
-Oh, perfect.
-Yes!

11:39.366 --> 11:40.909
Roger-dodger.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.369
Then we'll come through
to the sky lounge.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.578
Oh, yeah.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.830
And then this is the bar
we use the most.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.248
We do have one downstairs.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.458
We'll use 'em both, it's fine.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.296
Oh, my God, I need
to order more alcohol.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.425
Captain Sandy,
that's all guests on board,

11:57.467 --> 11:58.426
and the passerelle in.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.053
Thank you very much.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.805
This is our primary cabin.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.306
-Ooh!
-Wow.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.349
Late-night party, for sure.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.436
All right, Malia, you can
free up all your lines...

12:08.478 --> 12:09.521
Drop 'em all.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.939
Copy.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.357
You can start loosening
it for them.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.109
David, let me know when
the port bow is free.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.944
Port bow is now free
and coming aboard.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.320
This one's gonna be next.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.197
That's all stern lines on board.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.448
-Who needs a top-up?
-I'm ready for a cocktail...

12:20.490 --> 12:22.033
Tito's and iced tea.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.535
Okay, cool,
I'll bring up everything.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.870
All right, Malia, run up
here as far as you can.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.288
Copy.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.540
We've got heaps of iced
tea under the stairs,

12:28.581 --> 12:29.958
-we might have to pull them out.
-Okay.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.042
Do you wanna go
get changed, quickly?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.085
Yeah.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.630
-Okay.
-Okay, you're good.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.549
How much space do have
to my port dolphin?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.467
Plenty of room,
just the same amount.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.052
My first season,
Captain Sandy

12:41.094 --> 12:42.470
let me take the boat
off the dock.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.472
Turn it all the way
to starboard.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.224
Come out of...

12:46.266 --> 12:47.225
Stern's free to swing,
stern's free to swing.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.518
This is perfect.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.270
This situation's
a little more difficult,

12:50.311 --> 12:52.147
because I'm actually taking
the boat out of the slip

12:52.188 --> 12:56.109
between two concrete dolphins
that I could hit.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.528
And then split your sticks.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.575
-Come out.
-Come out of gear.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.910
Let it swing, then start
straightening out?

13:05.952 --> 13:08.997
You'll get the feel of it,
it's a natural happening.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.459
Yeah.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.169
<i>Thanks, guys, we can</i>
<i>bring fenders inside.</i>

13:14.210 --> 13:15.587
<i>Copy.</i>

13:15.628 --> 13:17.547
-Oh, don't go to stern.
-Don't?

13:17.589 --> 13:19.341
No, see, look at your speed.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.925
Gotcha.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.177
Yes, you...
this boat steers really well.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.888
Do you wanna take
these up to them,

13:24.929 --> 13:25.972
and I can go get
changed quickly?

13:26.014 --> 13:27.015
Yeah, sure.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.224
Chad, don't pee in the hot tub.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.267
Too late.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.894
Hi, guys.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.313
Tito's and iced tea,
I believe, for you?

13:33.355 --> 13:34.314
-Nice job.
-Thank you.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.565
So cool.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.067
-Okay, I got it.
-Okay.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.151
-You guys can go to work.
-Thank you.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.569
-Thank you.
-That was epic.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.326
Another.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.619
Gosh, you guys,
this is gorgeous.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.204
Could have used
my drink, though.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.205
What is your name again?

13:50.246 --> 13:51.247
-Lexi.
-Okay.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.208
Okay.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.209
-Yes.
-Okay.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.251
And I'm second.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.544
And I'm second stewardess.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.296
It's like when you
tell them that,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.048
they always instantly, like,
treat you a different way.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.049
Beautiful, thank you.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.175
Oh, thank you, my pleasure.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.551
Out of respect.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.262
And I'm very, very,
very big on respect.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.223
ETA to anchorage is 30 minutes.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.599
How did it feel
to drive the boat out?

14:09.641 --> 14:10.600
Really good.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.143
Yeah.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.478
I just went upstairs,
they're good.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.563
They seem pretty
relaxed right now.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.606
Oh, I'm out.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.028
I need to marry a chef,
for sure.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.571
Oh, I'd marry you
in a heartbeat.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.157
Aw! Stop it!

14:28.118 --> 14:29.160
Yeah.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.079
These guys' drinks are empty.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.080
Are you ready, or you're gonna
just start plating cold stuff?

14:32.122 --> 14:33.248
Just start plating.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.582
Once that's done I'll seat them,

14:34.624 --> 14:36.418
and then we can go
with everything else.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.545
You're definitely out of booze,
so that's a problem.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.255
I don't like that noise.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.589
-[phone rings]
-Go ahead.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.508
Do you wanna just
go under the stairs

14:43.550 --> 14:44.592
and grab all the iced tea?

14:44.634 --> 14:46.302
It's all peach flavor.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.429
All righty, I'll grab it.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.307
----ing hell, bro.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.059
Can we go down this
little hole thing?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.644
-Is it a hole?
-I don't know if that's for you.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.271
-Well, I hear them down there.
-We're gonna find out.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.189
All right, well, you know
what my drink order is.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.025
Surprise...

15:00.066 --> 15:01.526
The boys need Tito's and
tea upstairs, they're out.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.445
Yeah, I'm making some now.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.280
These people, they're drinking
really ----ing quickly.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.698
Tito's and tea.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.160
Oh, I think this is gonna
be a very long charter.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.745
I feel like we've
been forgotten.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.288
----ing Chad's getting more
attention than we are.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.789
Coming up...

15:14.831 --> 15:16.624
Captain Sandy, we have
a police vessel approaching.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.382
You're definitely out of booze,
so that's a problem.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.553
-We need...
-I don't like that noise.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.096
Ow.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.806
Surprise...

15:31.848 --> 15:33.183
The boys need Tito's and tea
upstairs, they're out.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.434
Yeah, I'm making some now.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.685
Tito's and tea.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.853
I feel like we've
been forgotten.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.688
-Iced tea.
-Yeah.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.357
[bleep] me running.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.733
Oh, I'm coming to you, sorry.

15:41.775 --> 15:42.734
I know, we can hear it.

15:42.776 --> 15:43.735
Oh, yeah.

15:43.777 --> 15:44.736
Oh, we're sorry.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.737
Fine, it's okay.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.697
So, if you guys wanna be seated,

15:47.739 --> 15:48.865
the chef is ready
when you guys are.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.575
Yeah.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.369
Deck crew, deck crew,
five minutes till anchor drop.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.370
Copy.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.371
Who's dropping anchor?

15:54.412 --> 15:55.538
Z-dog?

15:55.580 --> 15:56.790
Lloyd can drop it,
you can call it?

15:56.831 --> 15:57.874
What are we gonna do?

15:57.916 --> 16:00.877
[chattering]

16:00.919 --> 16:02.087
Are we all set?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.546
All right, so after champagne,

16:03.588 --> 16:05.590
what are you girls
thinking you're drinking?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.092
I'm gonna have champagne, and
then I'm gonna have champagne.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.718
-Okay, are you...
-Water is for quitters.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.095
Amazing, this looks delish,
what is it?

16:10.136 --> 16:11.262
Thanks.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.431
Zucchini fries and
tomato burrata.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.521
Just makes sure you tell them
what it is when you place it.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.232
-All right!
-Okay, here we go, guys.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.233
Oh, yes.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.234
Tomato burrata.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.652
Zucchini fries.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.238
Oh, we've got a flatbread
with prosciutto.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.864
Ricotta and tomato.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.700
Oh, what's happening?

16:31.741 --> 16:33.618
So, this is a local John Dory
with a lemon beurre blanc sauce

16:33.660 --> 16:35.286
These are the starters?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.372
Yeah, you've still got
three courses to come.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.833
I'm just joking.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.419
I love talking to people,
being front of house.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.795
Like, that is my jam.

16:43.837 --> 16:44.921
I don't wanna be in the back,
you know?

16:44.963 --> 16:47.882
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.259
Tell Mat this is amazing.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.260
Yeah.

16:50.301 --> 16:53.722
Lloyd, in his natural habitat.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.557
D-d-deejay.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.476
After the support I got last
night, I feel comfortable about

16:58.518 --> 17:00.520
being 100 percent
myself on this boat.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.855
It's exceptionally rare.

17:01.896 --> 17:05.608
Look like
you're at a silent disco.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.278
Three shackles in the water,
you can drop the anchor.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.821
Copy.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.577
Blue is at the water line.

17:15.618 --> 17:16.828
Now, point
in the direction of the chain,

17:16.870 --> 17:19.164
make sure she can see you.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.458
Awesome, thank you, we're good.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.835
<i>Clear to open the transom.</i>

17:33.345 --> 17:34.471
Yeah.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.889
Don't even know why I asked.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.349
I was like, should I ask, or...

17:37.390 --> 17:38.641
Here's a new rule... don't ask.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.397
Swinging counter-clockwise.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.607
Good.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.484
Well done, Mzi.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.653
You're not a fish guy, and that
fish is still really good.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.489
Courtney, Courtney,
we can start clearing.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.823
Katie, do you know where we are,
exactly,

17:53.865 --> 17:55.742
right now, what
this town's called?

17:55.784 --> 17:56.785
Croatia.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.828
[laughing]

17:58.870 --> 18:00.413
I love Katie.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.790
Go down on break, sir.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.833
-Yeah.
-Giggity.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.460
What's the vibe?

18:05.502 --> 18:07.212
They said, "Tell him
the food's amazing."

18:07.253 --> 18:08.213
Oh, yay!

18:08.254 --> 18:09.339
Slide's out.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.341
-Ooh, I wanna see!
-Hi, guys.

18:11.383 --> 18:12.717
Are you guys coming down
for some water sports?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.344
Yeah, we're ready.

18:14.386 --> 18:15.720
Yeah, we're ready for
some water sports.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.971
Are we gonna
pump up Maureen today?

18:17.013 --> 18:18.473
Yeah, you wanna start
laying her out?

18:18.515 --> 18:20.809
I feel like she's your
girlfriend.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.894
Maureen... what a girl.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.897
[phone rings]

18:25.939 --> 18:26.898
Hello?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.525
Hi, chica.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.944
Can you just iron
the tablecloth for tonight?

18:30.985 --> 18:32.862
Yeah.

18:32.904 --> 18:35.031
And then just let us know
when Sandy's bedding's ready,

18:35.073 --> 18:36.366
and Court will come grab it.

18:36.408 --> 18:37.534
-All righty.
-Thanks, chick.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.576
Bye.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.708
Really?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.586
Yeah.

18:51.715 --> 18:52.757
Yeah.

19:03.601 --> 19:09.399
This is Malia's
sexy black dress.

19:09.441 --> 19:10.608
How was your lunch?

19:10.650 --> 19:11.901
Oh, my God, it was amazing.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.611
So much food!

19:13.653 --> 19:15.321
-This is awesome.
-Yes.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.322
-Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
-I love it.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.574
What's happening, Hugh?

19:17.615 --> 19:20.785
Oh, my God, Hugh Hefner's here.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.620
All right, we doing this?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.914
Woohoo!

19:26.916 --> 19:28.418
Fun.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.295
Ass-up, face-up...
story of our lives.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.921
Woo!

19:34.758 --> 19:37.385
Lloyd, you can drive the boat
out of the anchorage tomorrow.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.762
Wow, that would be incredible.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.055
We're gonna leave
early in the morning.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.557
Okay.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.600
You guys wanna go on
a jet ski now?

19:43.641 --> 19:44.851
-Yeah.
-Okay.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.519
-You been on a jet ski before?
-Yes.

19:46.561 --> 19:47.520
That's the go into gear,
and your accelerator.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.855
Woo!

19:48.897 --> 19:49.939
You have to stay 300 meters away
from shore.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.359
Okay.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.693
There you go!

19:53.735 --> 19:56.905
<i>Bridge, that is</i>
<i>both jet skis away.</i>

19:56.946 --> 19:58.323
Careful!

19:58.365 --> 19:59.741
And we're gonna get a fine.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.912
[alarm blares]

20:11.544 --> 20:13.963
Captain Sandy, we have
a police vessel approaching.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.091
-Copy.
-Uh-oh.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.967
-I am on my way.
-Oh, my God.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.354
They are crazy.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.109
[alarm blares]

20:41.032 --> 20:44.035
Sh--. that's me with the steam,
that's me with the steam.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.746
Captain Sandy, we have a police
vessel approaching.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.373
I'm on my way.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.043
It's the steam from the iron.

20:52.085 --> 20:55.672
It set off the alarm.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.550
When you see the police coming,
of course it's not good.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.010
-Uh-oh.
-Hello!

21:02.178 --> 21:04.055
Okay.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.518
The shore?
Okay.

21:08.560 --> 21:12.856
So, 300 meters is a lot
further away from shore.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.191
Basically just stay
clear of any shoreline.

21:15.233 --> 21:18.486
Ugh, I hate this sh--.
I hate being in laundry.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.950
Yeah, of course.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.578
Are we heading
up to the hot tub?

21:26.619 --> 21:30.415
Interior, interior, that's all
guests in the hot tub.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.917
We can start pulling for dinner.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.794
I think we can start
bringing things in.

21:34.836 --> 21:37.589
Think they're hitting the booze
too much to ride jet skis again.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.798
So, we'll do plated courses
tonight, yeah?

21:38.840 --> 21:40.050
What do you wanna do?

21:40.091 --> 21:41.718
Let's do a salad
and main, a soup.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.886
-Ooh, a soup.
-I feel like pumpkin.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.596
Should I do pumpkin
or cauliflower?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.681
Do cauliflower, because people
always get pumpkin soup.

21:46.723 --> 21:47.849
-Yeah.
-Soup's fun to garnish.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.143
Yeah.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.770
Do you know what time
you would want dinner?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.063
Like, 8:00 or 9:00.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.064
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.690
-Hey.
-Hey, mate.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.025
You look awesome.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.943
So, dinner, 8:30, 9:00-ish.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.945
-All right.
-Then we gotta tie it off.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.489
-Nice.
-Sweet, let's go.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.783
* Start getting ready
for dinner *

22:06.785 --> 22:09.621
Oh, you know what we could
do, cut some oranges again,

22:09.662 --> 22:12.165
and then I'll have Court up
here topping up champagne.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.751
Okay, cool.

22:14.793 --> 22:17.128
I'm literally the Cinderella
of this charter.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.760
And that's not okay.

22:23.802 --> 22:26.638
This laundry is driving
me mad, [bleep].

22:31.601 --> 22:33.812
Obviously, with Malia,
it's, like, kind of awkward.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.856
Epaulettes by 6:30 or whenever
this gets done packing away.

22:36.898 --> 22:40.110
But feelings or not,
crush or not,

22:40.151 --> 22:42.862
I'd rather be prided on my
work than anything else.

22:42.904 --> 22:43.947
-Thanks, guys.
-Yeah.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.615
Oof.

22:45.657 --> 22:46.950
-Do you want a glass?
-Can I have, like, half a glass?

22:46.991 --> 22:48.284
-Half a glass?
-Of course, yeah.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.578
Tension.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.624
There's not much else.

22:54.666 --> 22:55.625
Do you wanna do
a quick deck check?

22:55.667 --> 22:57.627
Yeah, cool.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.629
So, how you feeling
on the interior, good?

22:59.671 --> 23:01.715
Yeah, I've got
Courtney for service.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.216
Here you go.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.635
She wants to get better
with, like, drinks and stuff.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.013
They're very happy.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.806
And Lexi's been so quiet.

23:09.848 --> 23:11.224
She's been very quiet.

23:11.266 --> 23:12.976
She's a bit more chatty
in the pantry.

23:13.018 --> 23:14.811
Yeah.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.312
Lexi's been quiet.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.857
She's been quiet sort of
ever since that night.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.861
But if she's unhappy with doing
laundry or housekeeping, like,

23:22.902 --> 23:24.654
you know the job,
and I'm not gonna punish

23:24.696 --> 23:27.240
Courtney by taking her off
service to keep Lexi happy.

23:27.282 --> 23:29.951
Because this is how it works...
we rotate.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.620
Oh, it's so pretty.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.039
-Beautiful.
-Gorgeous.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.290
Dinner at 8:30?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.167
-Yes.
-I have two beverages.

23:37.208 --> 23:40.920
Are these both mine?
Ah [bleep] it, I'll drink 'em.

23:40.962 --> 23:42.047
Okay, I'm here.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.590
Okie-dokie.

23:43.631 --> 23:44.674
I'll see you at 10:00.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.593
See ya, man, have a good rest.

23:46.634 --> 23:47.802
He's in charge.

23:49.721 --> 23:52.182
One hour to power hour.

23:52.223 --> 23:55.018
When guests come to the boat,
usually they come to the chef

23:55.060 --> 23:56.728
and they're like, you,
we're here to see you.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.688
We can't wait
to taste your food.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.690
It's, like, a lot of pressure
directed right at you.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.984
I don't think I'd be,
like, broken

24:03.026 --> 24:04.986
if someone complained
about the food,

24:05.028 --> 24:07.572
but it is nice that
it doesn't happen.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.202
Wait, get the button in there.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.203
How's it going?

24:13.244 --> 24:14.662
Pretty good, yourself?

24:14.704 --> 24:16.289
-Ooh, I love your hair tonight.
-Good.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.124
I had a little extra time on
my hands, thanks to these guys.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.376
Yeah!

24:19.417 --> 24:20.627
I already feel
comfortable letting them

24:20.669 --> 24:21.711
drop the anchors on their own.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.046
I'm starting to get breaks.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.632
Like, I've noticed
that not one of the guys

24:25.674 --> 24:27.217
has a problem
asking questions.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.052
I love that.

24:29.094 --> 24:32.681
I wanna reiterate...
just on charter.

24:32.722 --> 24:35.350
We could split it, it can
go across each wooden thing.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.852
Not just a pretty face, are ya?

24:39.187 --> 24:41.022
Ouch!
Oh, man.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.608
There's a whole other stairwell
we probably should be using.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.655
Ready for dinner?

24:50.073 --> 24:52.742
Cute dresses, ladies, meow.

24:52.784 --> 24:53.952
-Meow!
-Rawr!

24:53.993 --> 24:55.662
What's with all the meowing?

24:55.704 --> 24:58.164
Hi, do you wanna start
with turndown in the master?

24:58.206 --> 25:00.083
Sure.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.084
Thank you.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.210
No prob, be there.

25:05.839 --> 25:08.258
Sure.

25:08.299 --> 25:09.259
Have you ever made
a martini before?

25:09.300 --> 25:10.927
No.

25:10.969 --> 25:12.679
So, a bit of vodka,
and when they say "dirty,"

25:12.721 --> 25:14.264
that means more olive juice.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.100
Shake it, shake it!

25:17.142 --> 25:18.101
Trash that.

25:18.143 --> 25:19.185
-Dirty.
-Very dirty.

25:19.227 --> 25:20.770
I like it dirty.

25:20.812 --> 25:21.938
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much, Courtney.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.898
You're welcome.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.316
Oh, yum.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.193
-Who's hungry?
-We're all hungry!

25:27.235 --> 25:28.445
We're all hungry, all the time.

25:28.486 --> 25:30.030
-Should we sit down?
-Heck, yes.

25:30.071 --> 25:32.240
Oh, my gosh, it's beautiful,
thank you, guys!

25:32.282 --> 25:34.117
Oh, it's so glittery!

25:34.159 --> 25:38.246
Do you wanna tell Mat that
we're a minute and a half off?

25:38.288 --> 25:40.081
There's some more olives
on the table here.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.332
It's gonna be a
minute and a half,

25:41.374 --> 25:42.834
-so if you wanna start...
-Perfect.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.294
One shot, oh, boy.

25:44.336 --> 25:47.005
-Ah!
-Woo!

25:47.047 --> 25:50.216
Ba, ba, ba!

25:50.258 --> 25:51.676
Sup, bitch?

25:51.718 --> 25:53.053
What's up, baby girl?

25:53.094 --> 25:54.179
Oh, that was way nicer
than what I said to you.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.973
-Yeah.
-Sorry.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.142
With Mzi, I feel like we have,
like, this weird connection.

25:59.184 --> 26:02.270
Obviously I do have that sort
of connection with Courtney.

26:02.312 --> 26:03.980
I feel like I've known
him for, like, years.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.232
It feels like we've
known each other forever.

26:06.274 --> 26:07.484
I think he likes me.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.277
I don't even know
if she likes me.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.029
It's always fun to, like,
have somebody on board

26:11.071 --> 26:12.781
that you kinda, like, have that,
like, flirty banter with.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.240
I feel like we have
good banter at the moment.

26:14.282 --> 26:15.825
So, we'll see.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.452
So...

26:17.494 --> 26:19.788
We'll see.

26:19.829 --> 26:22.791
* Snack-city, bitch,
snack city city bitch *

26:22.832 --> 26:24.709
* Ten, ten, twenties and
a fifty, bitch *

26:26.169 --> 26:27.170
Lexi, Lexi, Katie.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.797
Go ahead.

26:28.838 --> 26:29.964
Do you wanna come be
on standby in the galley?

26:30.006 --> 26:31.424
Coming.

26:31.466 --> 26:34.386
Cauliflower soup with basil
oil and parmesan crisps.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.346
Let's all hope
the teacup handle to the right.

26:36.388 --> 26:37.889
Cheers!

26:37.931 --> 26:39.516
It's like mom squad
and three dudes.

26:39.557 --> 26:42.727
Ooh, this looks good.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.354
For your first course
this evening,

26:44.396 --> 26:48.983
we have a cauliflower soup with
basil oil and a parmesan crisp.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.193
So good, oh, my gosh.

26:50.235 --> 26:51.861
Oh!

26:51.903 --> 26:53.029
I love it.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.072
I can eat this all day.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.076
Wait, did... have they
liked everything so far?

26:58.118 --> 26:59.202
Yeah.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.121
They're really, like, lovely.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.288
Love it.

27:03.790 --> 27:04.791
All righty.

27:07.877 --> 27:11.172
This is delicious.

27:11.214 --> 27:12.382
Katie, Katie, Lexi.

27:12.424 --> 27:13.883
Go ahead.

27:13.925 --> 27:15.093
I did all the cabins.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.137
Copy.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.388
Ugh, seriously?

27:18.430 --> 27:20.306
[bleep]'s sake.

27:20.348 --> 27:23.184
Katie, Katie, Courts.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.020
[bleep] my life.

27:25.061 --> 27:26.479
I need some more
wine, definitely.

27:26.521 --> 27:28.440
-I could use some wine.
-None of us have any wine.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.233
When she comes back, I'll ask.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.027
-Oh, you don't have a bell?
-I don't.

27:32.068 --> 27:34.362
-I hate these duvets.
-Me too.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.072
Like, this is all wrong.

27:36.114 --> 27:37.157
That's in the wrong way,
that's why.

27:37.198 --> 27:38.825
Who did this cabin?

27:38.867 --> 27:40.076
Lexi.

27:40.118 --> 27:42.120
It drives me insane.

27:42.162 --> 27:44.539
With Lexi, like, whatever
Katie tells her to do,

27:44.581 --> 27:46.332
if it's not anything to
do with the guests...

27:54.507 --> 27:56.009
-Here's wine.
-Go, go, go!

27:56.051 --> 27:57.260
Go, Patrick, go!

27:57.302 --> 27:58.511
Pour it.

27:58.553 --> 28:00.555
Okay.

28:00.597 --> 28:03.308
Go, Patrick, go!
Oh, you got more, baby.

28:03.350 --> 28:04.976
We'll definitely need
another bottle of the red.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.395
[bleep] like, I need to
be doing this for you.

28:07.437 --> 28:08.396
Sorry, Katie.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.273
No, no, no, you're fine.

28:10.315 --> 28:12.275
Right now, I genuinely feel
like I'm failing at my job.

28:12.317 --> 28:14.361
I suppose I'd better
get some more wine.

28:14.402 --> 28:15.362
[laughing]

28:15.403 --> 28:16.488
Ugh.

28:16.529 --> 28:17.989
Coming up...

28:18.031 --> 28:19.908
This is the kind of stuff
that upsets me.

28:19.949 --> 28:21.117
So, they...

28:21.159 --> 28:22.452
We just have the pump
plugged in,

28:22.494 --> 28:23.620
and just keep airing it
up after every...

28:23.661 --> 28:24.913
I know.
The slide is always drama.

28:24.954 --> 28:26.581
I'm very aware of what happened.

28:34.130 --> 28:34.547
Wah, wah, wah.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.342
Did you just do bah, bah, bah?

28:37.384 --> 28:39.511
Bah, bah, bah.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.554
Garlic mash,
zucchini, surf-n-turf.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.014
These four are medium-rare.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.516
-Medium.
-I need a medium-rare.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.559
This is a medium.
This is a medium-rare.

28:46.601 --> 28:49.020
Okay, I'm just gonna take it.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.355
For your main course tonight,

28:50.397 --> 28:53.024
you have a surf-n-turf
with lobster,

28:53.066 --> 28:55.694
garlic mash, roasted veggies,
and a red wine jus.

28:55.735 --> 28:56.695
-Yes!
-Thank you very much.

28:56.736 --> 28:59.197
-No.
-"No."

29:00.490 --> 29:01.658
I actually don't need anything.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.326
-It's amazing.
-Oh, my gosh.

29:03.368 --> 29:05.120
I'm so glad there's
no vegans in this group.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.579
Absolutely killed it.

29:06.621 --> 29:08.039
Can he come up when
he has a minute?

29:08.081 --> 29:10.375
-Yes, of course.
-Okay, awesome.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.460
These ones need
the deep wash...

29:12.502 --> 29:13.586
...whites.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.380
-What?
-Just impressed...

29:15.422 --> 29:17.716
No guest complaints,
galley's clean.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.634
-Are you sure you're a chef?
-Best day ever.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.469
They wanna speak to you,
they just asked.

29:22.637 --> 29:24.431
Hey.

29:24.472 --> 29:26.599
Do you wanna just finish, and
then you can start at 6:30?

29:26.641 --> 29:28.101
Oh, awesome, all righty.

29:28.143 --> 29:29.936
I want to talk
about Oktoberfest.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.688
Let's go over here and chat.

29:31.730 --> 29:33.356
-Dave, you all good?
-Yeah.

29:33.398 --> 29:35.066
All right, I'm probably
gonna head down.

29:35.108 --> 29:36.693
-Here's my thoughts.
-Yep.

29:36.735 --> 29:38.737
But I want you to, like,
put your own thing into it,

29:38.778 --> 29:41.031
because this food
has been... dude.

29:41.072 --> 29:42.240
Thank you.

29:42.282 --> 29:43.700
----ing the best, dude.
-Thank you.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.368
Best I've ever had in my life.

29:45.410 --> 29:46.661
What I was thinking is,
like, start during the day,

29:46.703 --> 29:48.288
like, early on.

29:48.329 --> 29:51.583
We do, like, more on
the, like, the bratwurst.

29:51.624 --> 29:54.252
But what I'd like to do
is transition into dinner.

29:54.294 --> 29:55.670
Courses.

29:55.712 --> 29:58.048
I'm not gonna say drop
the German flair,

29:58.089 --> 30:01.426
but I'm saying
drop the German flair

30:01.468 --> 30:03.303
and just make a
----ing awesome dinner.

30:03.345 --> 30:04.763
All right.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.139
-Is that cool, like...
-Yeah, that's great.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.515
We'll be dressed
like dipsh--s.

30:07.557 --> 30:08.516
But, like, it'll be
an awesome dinner.

30:08.558 --> 30:10.018
No, you guys are awesome.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.103
So, my schnitzel
and chill is gone.

30:12.145 --> 30:13.605
What's happening?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.607
Well, it's almost
the witching hour, so...

30:15.648 --> 30:17.275
Okay, let's have a team meeting.

30:17.317 --> 30:19.027
We need to put
together a beer game.

30:19.069 --> 30:21.112
So, the idea is, like, a relay.

30:21.154 --> 30:22.280
So, the teams will
face off against each other.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.698
Yeah.

30:23.740 --> 30:24.699
-Flip cup.
-So, start with flip cup.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.242
Yeah.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.453
And then maybe dive
in to do something,

30:28.495 --> 30:29.996
swim back to the steps.

30:30.038 --> 30:31.539
-Bedtime!
-We gotta go down one.

30:31.581 --> 30:33.333
You did great on service,
great with the guests.

30:33.375 --> 30:34.793
Thank you, bru.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.336
Something with an egg, I think.

30:36.378 --> 30:38.213
Edward Fortyhands.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.798
They have to Edward Fortyhands
the whole way around the boat.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.466
But they have to be finished
by the time they get back.

30:41.508 --> 30:42.467
Oh!

30:42.509 --> 30:43.468
Ow!

30:43.510 --> 30:44.469
-[bleep]
-Oh, boy.

30:44.511 --> 30:45.637
Sweet, that's our plan.

30:45.679 --> 30:47.555
Tomorrow's gonna be fun.

30:47.597 --> 30:50.266
We'll all just be in our wets
and just, like, hype it up.

30:50.308 --> 30:52.644
-Mm-hmm.
-Night, boo.

30:52.686 --> 30:54.354
Good night.

31:02.195 --> 31:04.531
Oh, oh, my God.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.491
I know.
Feels so good.

31:06.533 --> 31:08.243
Ow.

31:22.382 --> 31:25.093
I'm so nervous doing
breakfast with Mathew.

31:25.135 --> 31:27.595
I don't know if I'm gonna
get the best day ever slogan

31:27.637 --> 31:30.181
or I'm gonna get, like,
the other side of him.

31:30.223 --> 31:32.225
I gotta wait for Katie.
Can you get Katie?

31:32.267 --> 31:34.102
-Is she still sleeping?
-Katie is asleep.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.687
-Okay.
-I am the breakfast girl, so...

31:35.729 --> 31:37.272
I hate this breakfast setup.

31:48.533 --> 31:51.494
Lloyd, Lloyd,
please come to the bridge.

31:51.536 --> 31:52.829
You're gonna drive
us outta here.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.414
Copy that, I'm on my way.

31:54.456 --> 31:55.707
-Lexi?
-Yeah.

31:55.749 --> 31:57.584
-Four baskets, please.
-Four baskets.

32:00.879 --> 32:02.756
-Morning.
-Morning.

32:02.797 --> 32:04.716
Hey, Captain, you'll be
driving us out.

32:04.758 --> 32:06.343
Hey.

32:06.384 --> 32:08.803
Go ahead and take your place
behind that seat.

32:08.845 --> 32:10.180
Ready to haul when you are.

32:10.221 --> 32:11.473
Copy, Malia.

32:11.514 --> 32:13.641
If you could start
raising the anchor.

32:13.683 --> 32:16.478
So, you'll just
use the thruster.

32:16.519 --> 32:18.605
Anchor is at the waterline.
That is the anchor home.

32:18.646 --> 32:20.565
Copy, Malia.

32:20.607 --> 32:22.359
And then what speed
have you been taking,

32:22.400 --> 32:23.693
just keeping at this?

32:23.735 --> 32:25.236
Right now, you'd
switch to autopilot...

32:25.278 --> 32:27.113
yeah, there you go.

32:27.155 --> 32:29.366
I've spent a lot of time
and money changing my career

32:29.407 --> 32:30.867
from being a tour guide,

32:30.909 --> 32:33.161
and then after my last boat
I was certainly starting

32:33.203 --> 32:34.162
to question whether
or not it was worth it

32:34.204 --> 32:35.747
and the right decision.

32:35.789 --> 32:38.249
But certainly at this time
it's looking like it was.

32:38.291 --> 32:39.501
I'm bloody loving it.

32:39.542 --> 32:40.502
It feels good, doesn't it?

32:40.543 --> 32:42.629
It does, yeah.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.255
You have control.

32:44.297 --> 32:46.591
Yeah, well, thank you.
Nice work there.

32:46.633 --> 32:47.592
Nice job.

32:47.634 --> 32:49.135
Good morning.

32:49.177 --> 32:50.595
Good morning, I brought
my own yerba mate tea,

32:50.637 --> 32:51.930
and I just need hot water.

32:51.971 --> 32:52.931
I'll have that coming up.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.766
I'm gonna check on Chad.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.518
I think he's
in the workout room.

32:57.811 --> 33:02.273
I like this tiny French press.

33:02.315 --> 33:03.316
What can I get you?

33:04.317 --> 33:05.360
Yeah.
Two cappuccinos?

33:05.402 --> 33:07.779
Yes.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.739
I've been waiting
for my tea for a while.

33:09.781 --> 33:10.824
I don't know,
it only takes four minutes.

33:14.911 --> 33:17.580
I don't think all those
cappuccinos are gonna fit.

33:19.791 --> 33:20.750
Go ahead.

33:20.792 --> 33:22.252
Hi, are you okay?

33:22.293 --> 33:23.962
Just busy making lattes.

33:24.004 --> 33:25.672
Okay, I'm just turning some
laundry, then I'll be up.

33:25.714 --> 33:27.257
All right, thanks.

33:27.298 --> 33:29.342
Deck crew, deck crew,
five minutes to anchor.

33:29.384 --> 33:30.635
Copy.

33:30.677 --> 33:32.595
Two cappuccinos for you.

33:32.637 --> 33:34.597
-Oh, perfect.
-Oh, yay.

33:34.639 --> 33:37.308
Maybe right here.

33:37.350 --> 33:41.646
It's really deep here, so
we're gonna do five shackles.

33:41.688 --> 33:43.690
Five shackles at the waterline.

33:43.732 --> 33:44.858
Thank you, thank you.

33:44.899 --> 33:46.693
Nice work.

33:46.735 --> 33:48.737
Well, guys, that was an
outstanding first day, man.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.947
If this is what you're waking up
to, it's not too ----ing shabby.

33:50.989 --> 33:52.741
-Good morning.
-Morning.

33:52.782 --> 33:54.993
I have to take a tea to Diane,
can you take it?

33:55.035 --> 33:56.828
Where is she?

33:56.870 --> 33:58.371
She's in the sundeck.

34:03.418 --> 34:04.502
Yes.

34:04.544 --> 34:05.587
Thanks.

34:06.963 --> 34:08.673
Good morning.

34:08.715 --> 34:11.509
-The tea, this is... yes.
-I have the tea here, yeah.

34:11.551 --> 34:12.886
Thank you.

34:12.927 --> 34:15.013
So, the chef's ready
when you guys are.

34:15.055 --> 34:16.556
Let's go sit.

34:19.851 --> 34:20.852
So, what's the worst
thing that can happen,

34:20.894 --> 34:22.812
we eat a little fly poop?

34:22.854 --> 34:24.356
I think I'm ready
for some fruit.

34:24.397 --> 34:27.275
-We're missing plates.
-Right there.

34:27.317 --> 34:29.986
Literally the first layer
of breakfast.

34:30.028 --> 34:31.363
Can we get some plates?

34:31.404 --> 34:32.989
Oh, are they not on the table?

34:33.031 --> 34:33.990
Negative, there's nothing there.

34:34.032 --> 34:35.617
Oh, I'm so sorry.

34:35.658 --> 34:36.868
We're just sitting
there staring at food.

34:36.910 --> 34:38.411
Oh, my God.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.455
She thought
they were already on the table.

34:40.497 --> 34:42.665
So, maybe it was somebody
else's job, and they blew it.

34:42.707 --> 34:45.627
I take pride in what I do,
so it's like when something

34:45.669 --> 34:47.921
like that happens
and it's not me,

34:47.962 --> 34:49.589
I look like I can't do my job.

34:49.631 --> 34:51.549
And it's, like, the most
simple ----ing thing.

34:51.591 --> 34:53.593
So sorry for that.

34:53.635 --> 34:55.261
No worries.

34:55.303 --> 34:56.763
Could we have some water,
when you get a minute?

34:56.805 --> 34:59.057
-And some extra napkins.
-Sure.

34:59.099 --> 35:00.517
You a one-man show
this morning, Katie?

35:00.558 --> 35:02.811
-What's happening?
-Yeah, kinda.

35:02.852 --> 35:04.479
I feel like you're everywhere.

35:07.899 --> 35:09.984
-Ready?
-Yeah.

35:10.026 --> 35:11.569
Come on, you beast.

35:13.321 --> 35:14.280
-Ah!
-Oh!

35:14.322 --> 35:15.740
Oh [bleep] me.

35:19.119 --> 35:20.537
Katie?

35:20.578 --> 35:22.080
Yeah, I'm gonna need
you to come up.

35:22.122 --> 35:23.540
Why?

35:23.581 --> 35:24.582
Because this is a ----ing
sh--show.

35:24.624 --> 35:25.667
My table wasn't even set.

35:28.461 --> 35:30.046
-Should I bring this out?
-Yeah.

35:30.088 --> 35:31.798
Katie is struggling because
Lexi didn't set her up.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.925
It's annoying, because
Katie works so hard.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.677
We've got some
avocado toast to start.

35:35.719 --> 35:37.512
Ooh!

35:37.554 --> 35:39.431
I feel like I'm biased if
I say Lexi should be fired,

35:39.472 --> 35:42.934
because half of it's just me
not enjoying being around her.

35:42.976 --> 35:45.353
But, like, I don't think
it's a fireable offense.

35:45.395 --> 35:47.022
She's ----ing annoying.

35:47.063 --> 35:48.023
Pardon my reach.

35:48.064 --> 35:49.482
Yeah, it's done.

35:49.524 --> 35:51.026
Just need to vacuum.

35:51.067 --> 35:52.902
I'm just gonna grab
a piece of toast.

35:54.988 --> 35:56.656
-That's really good.
-I'm ready to drink.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.535
Morning.

36:00.577 --> 36:01.995
Yeah, of course.

36:02.037 --> 36:04.080
Just be safe,
stay where we can see you.

36:04.122 --> 36:06.541
You're good.

36:06.583 --> 36:07.876
There ya go.

36:19.846 --> 36:21.765
Right, we're ready to go.

36:26.519 --> 36:28.980
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Yeah.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.820
<i>Bridge, bridge, that is</i>
<i>four guests in the water.</i>

36:35.862 --> 36:37.572
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

36:37.614 --> 36:40.533
Hey, Malia, Malia, this
slide needs some serious air.

36:40.575 --> 36:42.118
<i>We're the fun factor!</i>

36:42.160 --> 36:43.661
<i>Just need a few minutes.</i>

36:43.703 --> 36:44.996
Okay.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.003
-Good?
-All right, we're good, yes.

36:52.045 --> 36:53.171
All right.

36:53.213 --> 36:54.422
This is a big part
of our charter.

36:54.464 --> 36:55.465
Yeah.

36:55.507 --> 36:56.966
Why is this not hard?

36:57.008 --> 36:58.927
When I pumped it this morning,
everything was rock.

36:58.968 --> 37:00.428
Every time a client goes down,

37:00.470 --> 37:02.847
we keep it full
so they slide down.

37:02.889 --> 37:04.516
I love it when all
the toys are out.

37:04.557 --> 37:06.685
I wanna look like the most
fun boat on the water.

37:06.726 --> 37:08.520
You get all the toys
in the water.

37:08.561 --> 37:09.521
Okay.

37:09.562 --> 37:10.814
Every time we anchor.

37:10.855 --> 37:12.065
Is everything out?

37:12.107 --> 37:13.775
Always, everything's out, yeah.

37:13.817 --> 37:14.901
You guys killed it, you
got all the stuff out for us,

37:14.943 --> 37:16.861
I saw you guys
working 24/7.

37:16.903 --> 37:18.113
I don't know how you do it,
but we appreciate it.

37:18.154 --> 37:19.948
Yeah, amazing.

37:19.989 --> 37:22.075
We have to make every
second count for the client.

37:22.117 --> 37:23.076
I always want
the client to have fun.

37:23.118 --> 37:24.703
Yeah, of course.

37:24.744 --> 37:26.162
I don't care how much
this is a battle.

37:26.204 --> 37:27.997
Yeah.
Oh, no, this...

37:28.039 --> 37:29.082
-We battle it.
-Yeah, the slide's fine.

37:29.124 --> 37:30.083
Okay.

37:30.125 --> 37:31.626
This is the least of my battles.

37:31.668 --> 37:33.878
-How's it going?
-It needs serious air.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.589
I have it confirmed that
there is an actual leak.

37:36.631 --> 37:38.091
After every slide...
So, the...

37:38.133 --> 37:39.592
We could just have
the pump plugged in

37:39.634 --> 37:40.593
and just keep airing it
up after every...

37:40.635 --> 37:41.594
I know.

37:41.636 --> 37:42.971
The problem is we have one pump,

37:43.013 --> 37:44.556
so it's going from here,
back there, here.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.891
Why, is there a leak back there?

37:46.933 --> 37:48.476
No, we have toys to pump up.

37:48.518 --> 37:49.644
Would anyone else like
a top-off of wine?

37:49.686 --> 37:51.771
All right, I'll do this.

37:51.813 --> 37:52.981
Okay.

37:54.607 --> 37:55.567
For you, champagne?

37:55.608 --> 37:56.735
Yeah, I want a champagne.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.069
-I'll take that.
-Thank you.

37:58.111 --> 38:01.781
Thanks.

38:01.823 --> 38:03.491
It's gonna be fun.

38:06.536 --> 38:09.456
My knee is actually ----ing
from these stairs.

38:12.167 --> 38:13.460
Yeah.

38:16.212 --> 38:17.630
Thank you.

38:17.672 --> 38:18.882
Two bottles of
champers down already.

38:22.802 --> 38:25.472
I've checked all of them,
so unless it broke today...

38:25.513 --> 38:26.931
No, I just heard it leaking air.

38:26.973 --> 38:29.768
I'm gonna see if he has a kit.

38:49.162 --> 38:51.081
He filled it up this morning,
so by the time

38:51.122 --> 38:53.625
the guests wanna use it,
we have to fill it up again.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.835
Oh, so it does last.

38:55.877 --> 38:59.172
It just depends when they go
on versus when we inflated it.

38:59.214 --> 39:01.758
The slide is always drama.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.176
Fun.

39:03.218 --> 39:04.594
So, you're...

39:04.636 --> 39:06.137
I'm very aware of what happened.

39:06.179 --> 39:08.181
The slide just needs
to have the pump there.

39:15.271 --> 39:16.231
All I'm trying to do is
find a solution

39:18.233 --> 39:20.026
-for the slide, that's it.
-Yeah, we know the solution.

39:20.068 --> 39:21.194
They just didn't have
the pump there.

39:21.236 --> 39:22.278
So, you're...

39:22.320 --> 39:23.822
I'm very aware of what happened.

39:23.863 --> 39:26.241
The slide just needs
to have the pump there.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.827
All right, well, calm down.
I'm not challenging you, Malia.

39:28.868 --> 39:30.870
I know, I'm just hungry
and the guests are,

39:30.912 --> 39:32.997
like, full-blown water
sports right now.

39:33.039 --> 39:34.749
I'll take care of it.

39:34.791 --> 39:36.334
I know how it has to happen,
it just didn't get done.

39:36.376 --> 39:37.711
I understand it's
full-throttle back there.

39:37.752 --> 39:38.795
Just keep breathing.

39:38.837 --> 39:39.963
I'm just hungry.

39:40.005 --> 39:41.798
-Eat!
-Whew.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.591
-It's been a morning.
-It's been a morning.

39:47.053 --> 39:48.805
Oh, I wasn't done.

39:48.847 --> 39:51.391
When I was trying to finish,
I was doing juicing and then...

39:51.433 --> 39:52.767
it's just what it is.

39:52.809 --> 39:53.893
What time did everyone get up?

39:53.935 --> 39:55.270
They got up randomly.

39:55.311 --> 39:56.688
They didn't all get up
at the same time.

39:56.730 --> 39:58.690
So, I was...
I was doing laundry.

39:58.732 --> 40:01.109
-Yeah.
-And I ran down, juiced...

40:01.151 --> 40:03.236
I was doing, like, 20 different
things, so I didn't finish it.

40:05.739 --> 40:09.701
The plates thing, I had no idea,
I think my brain is swamped.

40:09.743 --> 40:11.327
I mean, no one wants
to mess up, right?

40:11.369 --> 40:14.247
And I forgot to put the plates
and cutlery down, so that sucks.

40:14.289 --> 40:17.625
What time did we wanna do
Olympics, now?

40:17.667 --> 40:19.252
Yeah.

40:19.294 --> 40:22.172
All crew, all crew, this is
the start of beer Olympics.

40:22.213 --> 40:23.923
-Are we ready?
-Yeah!

40:23.965 --> 40:25.717
Woo!

40:25.759 --> 40:28.428
Three, two, one, go!

40:28.470 --> 40:30.972
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

40:34.434 --> 40:35.643
Oh, you're close, you're close.

40:35.685 --> 40:37.395
So close.

40:39.022 --> 40:41.816
As soon as the last person
flips their cup,

40:41.858 --> 40:44.778
they have to get into Maureen,
get the beers,

40:44.819 --> 40:48.281
chug a beer, jump off Maureen,
get to the swim steps.

40:48.323 --> 40:51.910
Good job, good job!

40:51.951 --> 40:53.953
They can then don
their lifejacket upside-down,

40:53.995 --> 40:55.830
run all the way
up to the sundeck,

40:55.872 --> 40:58.083
where a champbong
will be waiting.

40:58.124 --> 40:59.292
-Oh, my God.
-Pour it.

40:59.334 --> 41:01.211
Oh, where's my champbong,
bitches!

41:01.252 --> 41:02.295
Okay, ready?

41:02.337 --> 41:03.338
Go!

41:03.380 --> 41:04.881
Oh, you wanna get going.

41:04.923 --> 41:06.216
Oh!

41:06.257 --> 41:07.926
-Diane!
-She went down here.

41:07.967 --> 41:10.762
-No, you gotta come up here.
-You gotta come up here.

41:10.804 --> 41:13.682
They then have to shotgun
a beer through the snorkel,

41:13.723 --> 41:16.184
jump off the bridge deck.

41:16.226 --> 41:17.227
All right.

41:19.104 --> 41:20.271
I'll get ready.

41:20.313 --> 41:21.815
Still waiting for...

41:21.856 --> 41:23.358
still waiting for
someone to jump.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.026
-What's happening up there?
-They did it together.

41:26.027 --> 41:29.864
[chattering]

41:29.906 --> 41:32.742
The last person's gonna
have an Edward Fortyhands.

41:32.784 --> 41:34.119
Chug, chug, chug!

41:34.160 --> 41:35.370
First person to get
back here

41:35.412 --> 41:36.830
and finish their beer
is the winner.

41:36.871 --> 41:40.000
Woo!

41:40.041 --> 41:41.459
Oh!

41:47.173 --> 41:48.800
So you can flaunt them.

41:48.842 --> 41:50.176
Patrick, do you wanna
crown me, or...

41:50.218 --> 41:51.386
Well played, well played.

41:51.428 --> 41:52.887
Woo!

41:52.929 --> 41:54.973
Thanks for the crew,
that was awesome.

41:55.015 --> 41:56.182
Yeah!

41:56.224 --> 41:57.350
Thank you guys,
that was fun as hell.

41:57.392 --> 41:59.394
Hi.

41:59.436 --> 42:01.312
All cabins are basically done.

42:01.354 --> 42:03.815
Cool, do you wanna just go
jump in the laundry, and...

42:03.857 --> 42:05.400
Yeah, I was down there turning.

42:05.442 --> 42:07.861
-Cool, thank you.
-Putting some towels in.

42:07.902 --> 42:09.029
After that, do you wanna
go on a break?

42:09.070 --> 42:10.196
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

42:10.238 --> 42:12.866
All right, so...

42:14.951 --> 42:18.038
Owie.

42:18.079 --> 42:19.330
I'll have a Corona with lime.

42:19.372 --> 42:20.373
-That's easy.
-Yeah, sure.

42:20.415 --> 42:21.875
That'd be great, thanks.

42:21.916 --> 42:23.335
Also, Lexi was starting
our room earlier,

42:23.376 --> 42:24.753
when I went to change into
my suit this morning...

42:24.794 --> 42:25.754
-Okay.
-And she never came back.

42:25.795 --> 42:27.213
Okay.

42:27.255 --> 42:28.757
So, it's like the cleaners
and everything

42:28.798 --> 42:30.008
are still in there, and there's
no towels.

42:30.050 --> 42:31.176
There isn't?
Okay, no worries.

42:31.217 --> 42:32.177
-Yeah.
-I'll send her in.

42:32.218 --> 42:33.553
Okay, thanks.

42:33.595 --> 42:36.222
I can't be having
my second stewardess

42:36.264 --> 42:38.516
failing at
the most simplest tasks.

42:38.558 --> 42:40.352
Go ahead.

42:40.393 --> 42:42.896
Can you just check that there's
towels in the twin cabin?

42:42.937 --> 42:44.189
All right, I'll check and see.

42:44.230 --> 42:45.273
Thank you.

42:45.315 --> 42:46.566
[bleep] sakes.

42:46.608 --> 42:49.402
Well, I just think about
that, you know?

42:49.444 --> 42:50.904
Yeah.

42:52.530 --> 42:55.367
How is it?

42:55.408 --> 42:57.118
What's wrong?

42:57.160 --> 42:59.204
It's just, like, a lot to do
get through the charter,

42:59.245 --> 43:01.998
but, like, she's making
my job really hard.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.250
I've had crew members
who have been like Lexi.

43:04.292 --> 43:05.251
Yeah.

43:05.293 --> 43:07.087
I just didn't give up.

43:07.128 --> 43:09.297
I like her, it's not
that I don't like her.

43:09.339 --> 43:11.549
I just feel like
I'll take responsibility

43:11.591 --> 43:12.550
and I'll take the brunt of it.

43:12.592 --> 43:13.885
Just don't give up.

43:13.927 --> 43:15.428
-We'll get there.
-Okay.

43:15.470 --> 43:17.263
Okay.

43:17.305 --> 43:18.973
It's very important to me
that the department heads

43:19.015 --> 43:21.476
encourage the team to step up.

43:21.518 --> 43:25.355
Right now, this is about Katie
and her leadership skills.

43:25.397 --> 43:29.484
I have to rely on Katie to
be able to navigate her stews.

43:29.526 --> 43:32.112
Now, if she can't, then
that's when I have to step in.

43:33.571 --> 43:35.824
[sighs]

43:38.910 --> 43:40.286
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:40.328 --> 43:41.413
Did anyone order a beer?

43:41.454 --> 43:42.872
[shouting]

43:42.914 --> 43:43.998
Hey!

43:44.040 --> 43:45.417
I've been to Oktoberfest twice.

43:45.458 --> 43:48.336
I know exactly
the party they want.

43:51.214 --> 43:52.882
Don't be mad at me, but
I made my own drink.

43:52.924 --> 43:53.967
-Well...
-Katie, do you take breaks?

43:54.009 --> 43:55.385
We only see you.

43:59.305 --> 44:00.932
We felt like there was
a little lack of attention.

44:00.974 --> 44:02.559
I actually had to make
my own drink this morning.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.144
[bleep]

44:04.185 --> 44:05.603
A couple times
where that happened.

44:05.645 --> 44:07.981
It seems more like
laziness than anything.

44:08.023 --> 44:12.068
It's not acceptable, and, like,
I'm at the breaking point.

44:12.110 --> 44:13.361
We've got a girl in quarantine.

44:16.406 --> 44:17.532
Hi!
