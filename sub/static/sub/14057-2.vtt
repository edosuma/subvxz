<i>Previously on the O.C.</i>

00:01.880 --> 00:03.390
Summer,we got to get out on the quad

00:03.390 --> 00:05.750
- what are we protesting?
- The chickens,man.It's the chickens!

00:05.750 --> 00:07.530
Who's that skank with Dr.Roberts?

00:07.530 --> 00:09.050
So that's the step-monster?

00:09.050 --> 00:12.020
- Well,I guess I'm going to get going.
- Mom,maybe I should go with you.

00:12.020 --> 00:15.090
- you're better off without me.
- I'm not going to go anywhere until you come with me.

00:15.220 --> 00:16.770
I just talked to you,you were in France.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.420
And you were in Rhode Island.

00:18.425 --> 00:20.650
- tomorrow,you want to get breakfast at the diner?
- Sure

00:20.683 --> 00:24.226
I really hope Ryan was there when you got back,because I won't be.

00:24.229 --> 00:26.140
you're never going to get over it,but you'll get used to it.

00:26.146 --> 00:29.386
I hired a private investigator to find out where he went.

00:29.389 --> 00:31.382
All the information is in this file.

Hello?

00:46.236 --> 00:47.200
It's me, I'm leaving.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.400
Do you need anything?

00:50.467 --> 00:51.963
No.

00:52.035 --> 00:54.100
So when does the plane land
in Providence?

00:54.168 --> 00:55.400
Half an hour?

00:55.465 --> 00:57.362
Well, okay, but I need
to talk to her now.

00:57.435 --> 01:00.100
Do you think you could maybe
connect me to the pilot?

01:00.168 --> 01:01.832
I'm...

01:01.907 --> 01:04.161
Damn it.

01:06.265 --> 01:08.803
It took the investigator
six months to find Volchok.

01:08.866 --> 01:10.930
Ryan, this may be
the only chance we get.

01:11.965 --> 01:13.800
He's not going to get away.

01:13.867 --> 01:15.031
I'll call you later.

01:37.538 --> 01:39.231
Ryan, hey, you're
up bright and early.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.430
I'm late.

01:40.507 --> 01:41.800
Really ? Late where ?
It's 6:00 in the morning.

01:41.868 --> 01:42.901
You got a paper route
or something ?

01:42.968 --> 01:44.331
The gym.
Oh.

01:44.406 --> 01:46.131
Could you drop me off
at the store?

01:46.205 --> 01:47.602
There's a new Supergirl
maquette coming in

01:47.665 --> 01:49.800
and I want to be there
before Philip and Leon

01:49.867 --> 01:51.103
get their greasy paws on it.

01:51.168 --> 01:53.233
Yeah, the gym's the
other way, I'm sorry.

01:53.306 --> 01:54.531
I heard you
on the phone.

01:56.806 --> 01:58.601
You were spying on me?
I wasn't spying on you.

01:58.668 --> 02:00.433
I was calling Summer
to find out why she left.

02:00.506 --> 02:02.260
What are you doing?
It's none of your business.

02:02.338 --> 02:04.700
Listen, if you know
where Volchok is,

02:04.767 --> 02:05.861
let's just call the police.

02:05.936 --> 02:08.301
No, I'm not
calling the police.

02:14.536 --> 02:15.461
I can't let you go.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.631
It's not really your choice.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.262
So what? Then, you're
just going to find Volchok

02:20.335 --> 02:21.761
and either kill him
or get yourself killed?

02:21.838 --> 02:23.461
That's insane.
This conversation is over.

02:23.536 --> 02:25.231
What are you...
what are you doing?

02:26.337 --> 02:27.531
I'm coming with you.

02:27.607 --> 02:29.000
It's not like you're leaving me
any choice.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.830
I'm going to tell the cops.

02:30.905 --> 02:32.331
I just need to see him first.

02:32.406 --> 02:34.902
No offense, but, like,
nobody believes that.

02:34.968 --> 02:37.032
If I tell Sandy or the cops,
they'll make me stay away.

02:37.108 --> 02:38.700
I need to be there
when they arrest him.

02:38.766 --> 02:41.033
The only way for me to do that
is if I'm there first.

02:41.107 --> 02:42.533
Okay, take me with you.
No.

02:42.605 --> 02:43.603
I won't get in the way.

02:43.666 --> 02:45.031
You know how stealth I can be.

02:47.236 --> 02:49.402
Why not? If that's really
all you're going to do.

02:53.105 --> 02:54.333
Okay.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.632
You have to do everything I say.

02:55.707 --> 02:56.933
All right, you're the boss.

02:58.466 --> 02:59.731
So where we going?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.730
Mexico.
Perfect,
I need Chiclets.

03:34.106 --> 03:35.931
They call this a place
of higher learning.

03:35.967 --> 03:38.060
I'll  tell you what I'm learning.

03:38.138 --> 03:40.901
I'm learning to think
for myself.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.900
I'm learning that what they call

03:42.968 --> 03:44.532
their property...

03:44.607 --> 03:47.232
No, it's our world.

03:47.305 --> 03:49.263
Summer! Hey!

03:51.268 --> 03:52.701
Hey.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.160
It's so good to see you.

03:54.236 --> 03:55.900
Where have you been?

03:55.965 --> 03:57.631
Oh, um, I had to go home.

03:57.708 --> 04:00.400
It was kind of an emergency,
but everything's okay now.

04:00.466 --> 04:02.633
It was just hard being there.

04:03.835 --> 04:05.032
What an amazing
spirit you have.

04:05.106 --> 04:07.332
I'll bet you, in a past
life, you were an eagle,

04:07.407 --> 04:09.033
soaring through
mountain passes.

04:09.107 --> 04:10.463
Do you ever have
dreams of flying?

04:10.535 --> 04:12.403
No, not really.

04:12.466 --> 04:13.763
What's going on?

04:13.837 --> 04:15.563
Oh, right, the
present, yes.

04:15.635 --> 04:17.700
19:00 hours last night,
the board of trustees--

04:17.765 --> 04:18.702
talk about an oxymoron--

04:18.766 --> 04:21.461
voted to cut down

04:21.536 --> 04:22.830
this majestic tree.
What?

04:22.908 --> 04:24.631
They can't do that.
Exactly.

04:24.708 --> 04:26.401
I mean, this tree
was, was an acorn

04:26.468 --> 04:29.331
in the primordial
miasma of America.

04:29.406 --> 04:31.103
It saw the rise of
this country, Summer,

04:31.167 --> 04:32.933
and in my opinion,
its fall.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.200
Now they want to cut it down
so some hung over sophomore

04:35.265 --> 04:37.130
can get to Poli-Sci
ten seconds faster.

04:37.206 --> 04:38.333
So what's the plan?

04:38.407 --> 04:40.133
The plan is to open
people's minds.

04:40.208 --> 04:41.431
The plan is to reject

04:41.505 --> 04:44.930
their dollar-driven
notions of progress.
Che,

04:45.007 --> 04:46.003
what's the actual plan?

04:46.068 --> 04:47.903
Oh, yeah, uh,
the actual plan.

04:47.965 --> 04:49.031
We've  got a petition

04:49.108 --> 04:50.432
and a 24-hour
tree-sit set to go,

04:50.506 --> 04:54.100
so if that doesn't
work, revolution.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.102
Okay, well,

04:56.165 --> 04:58.730
why don't we just start
with the tree-sit?

04:58.807 --> 05:00.361
I am so glad you're back.

05:00.438 --> 05:02.463
So is Mother Earth.

05:02.537 --> 05:03.501
Mm.

05:03.567 --> 05:04.862
She loves you very much.

05:04.936 --> 05:06.632
I love her.

05:06.707 --> 05:07.632
Good.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.861
Okay.

05:10.907 --> 05:12.102
Summer's with us!

05:12.166 --> 05:14.131
Huh? Huh?

05:32.208 --> 05:35.232
You have no new messages.

05:34.888 --> 05:36.023
Oh, uh,

05:36.068 --> 05:38.352
Seth left you a message
last night,

05:38.385 --> 05:40.270
but I accidentally
erased it.

05:41.265 --> 05:43.702
Hey.
Taylor?

05:45.365 --> 05:46.560
What are you doing in my bed?

05:46.638 --> 05:48.130
Do you want to get in?
We could snuggle.

05:48.207 --> 05:49.830
No.

05:49.907 --> 05:51.960
Um, what are you doing here

05:52.038 --> 05:54.531
and why are you listening
to my messages, Taylor?

05:54.607 --> 05:56.260
I don't suppose you have
an espresso maker.

05:56.335 --> 05:58.233
What are you wearing?

05:58.308 --> 05:59.732
What?  I always sleep in this.

05:59.805 --> 06:01.563
Okay, just put this on...

06:01.638 --> 06:02.830
immediately.

06:02.906 --> 06:03.891
Okay, now,

06:04.038 --> 06:05.633
will you tell me
what's going on?

06:05.705 --> 06:08.001
First, you're in Newport when
you're supposed to be in France.

06:08.065 --> 06:10.502
Then, your mom shows up
and you run away and--

06:10.566 --> 06:11.930
How did you get
here before me?

06:12.003 --> 06:13.236
Do you have
a secret twin?

06:13.309 --> 06:14.500
Because that would
explain so much.

06:14.566 --> 06:16.066
Okay, okay, sit down.

06:16.139 --> 06:18.360
I'm going to explain
everything to you.

06:18.438 --> 06:19.800
So, um...

06:20.868 --> 06:24.033
Something... happened in France.

06:24.105 --> 06:26.661
Just something... huge.

06:26.738 --> 06:29.502
And, uh, I came back to
tell my mom about it,

06:29.568 --> 06:31.133
and then,
I just got really scared

06:31.208 --> 06:33.500
and, uh, I was
completely lost, Summer.

06:34.838 --> 06:36.161
But then I realized

06:36.236 --> 06:39.633
that you... were the one person
who would understand.

06:39.708 --> 06:40.860
Summer,

06:41.935 --> 06:43.460
I...

06:43.535 --> 06:44.760
Oh, my God.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.003
When was the last time
you shaved your legs?

06:46.068 --> 06:47.162
It's like a forest, and--

06:47.238 --> 06:49.131
Oh, my God, your toenails.

06:49.205 --> 06:50.703
Okay, yeah,

06:50.765 --> 06:51.763
I don't do that stuff anymore.

06:51.838 --> 06:52.760
Obviously.

06:52.835 --> 06:54.503
You've got hobbit feet.

06:54.565 --> 06:55.803
Summer?

06:55.866 --> 06:57.760
Enrique just saw two guys
with chainsaws.

06:57.838 --> 06:59.232
This thing is going down
right now.

07:01.568 --> 07:03.232
Okay, um,...

07:03.306 --> 07:04.931
Taylor, I'm sorry;
my dining card is on the desk.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.203
We will talk about this
later, I promise, okay?

07:08.238 --> 07:10.862
Okay.

07:10.938 --> 07:13.203
Six absentees,

07:13.265 --> 07:15.033
13 tardies?

07:14.845 --> 07:17.750
Mr. Street said she
fell asleep twice in Latin.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.342
Well, you can't
blame her for that.

07:19.537 --> 07:20.700
I'm getting no reception.

07:20.837 --> 07:21.603
How many bars do you have?

07:21.666 --> 07:23.930
She has a whole slew
of missed assignments,

07:24.005 --> 07:26.430
and during bio lab,
Mr. Castle

07:26.505 --> 07:28.662
got the strong sense Kaitlin
was flirting with him.

07:28.736 --> 07:31.232
Is he the really short one?

07:31.305 --> 07:33.430
I'm, I'm sure she just
thought he was a student.

07:33.507 --> 07:35.333
Mrs. Cooper,
you're in the office

07:35.405 --> 07:36.632
of the dean of discipline.

07:36.708 --> 07:39.531
This doesn't happen
because of misunderstandings.

07:39.605 --> 07:41.933
Right, well, Dean Torres,

07:42.007 --> 07:44.260
Kaitlin tests in the top
three percent of her class.

07:44.335 --> 07:45.961
She's a natural leader.
Surely, this is just...

07:46.038 --> 07:50.132
All the more reason she
shouldn't waste her potential.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.163
Tell me, how are things at home?

07:53.236 --> 07:55.300
Good.

07:56.668 --> 07:57.933
Things are good.

08:00.507 --> 08:02.502
I don't know what to say.

08:02.568 --> 08:05.630
Yes, things have been difficult,
but we're doing our best.

08:05.708 --> 08:06.763
Neil works a lot.

08:06.835 --> 08:07.960
He actually just
left this morning

08:08.038 --> 08:10.202
for a conference in Seattle.

08:10.267 --> 08:11.662
But he and Kaitlin
are good friends

08:11.737 --> 08:13.731
and, and things are good.

08:13.808 --> 08:16.202
And you and Kaitlin?

08:16.266 --> 08:18.961
Talk about school, her life?

08:21.066 --> 08:23.703
I'm sorry, look,
Kaitlin is 15 years old.

08:23.765 --> 08:25.362
If I don't find
voodoo dolls of myself

08:25.438 --> 08:27.033
in her bedroom, I'm happy.

08:28.136 --> 08:29.960
Harbor's running
a clothing drive

08:30.035 --> 08:31.961
for the refugees in Darfur.

08:32.035 --> 08:33.830
That's a great idea;
I'll make sure she's there.

08:33.905 --> 08:35.261
Julie...
On a different note,

08:35.336 --> 08:37.503
do you know if cell
phones work in Mexico?

08:37.567 --> 08:41.429
I'd like you and Kaitlin to do
the clothing drive together.

08:47.408 --> 08:48.533
Excuse me?

08:51.958 --> 08:52.950
Huh.

08:52.656 --> 08:53.880
That's exactly what I said.

08:53.928 --> 08:55.301
And there was
nothing else?

08:55.365 --> 08:57.232
Nothing.

08:57.306 --> 08:59.761
Angry?

08:59.835 --> 09:00.861
Nudfo?

09:00.938 --> 09:02.700
Chocolate love?

09:02.765 --> 09:03.963
Nude fo...

09:04.038 --> 09:05.360
Nudfo? Is that a word?

09:05.436 --> 09:07.602
Not that I know of.

09:07.668 --> 09:09.133
When did you find this?

09:09.206 --> 09:10.601
Just now,
when I went to see

09:10.667 --> 09:13.203
if the boys had anything
to give to the clothing drive.

09:13.268 --> 09:14.200
You tried calling them?

09:14.267 --> 09:15.331
No answer.

09:15.405 --> 09:16.561
You know what I
think this is?

09:16.637 --> 09:17.632
A coded message?

09:17.706 --> 09:18.831
Nothing.

09:18.907 --> 09:20.531
It's probably the
name of a band.

09:20.607 --> 09:22.591
Seth wrote it on
a piece of paper and
put it in his pocket.

09:22.606 --> 09:23.642
Relax, sweetheart.

09:25.635 --> 09:27.033
Dad,  it's me.
Hello.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.703
Did you get my note?
I had to write it in code

09:28.767 --> 09:30.201
in case Ryan found it.

09:31.306 --> 09:33.662
Right, the note.

09:33.736 --> 09:35.030
Yeah, he says he's not going
to do anything to Volchok.

09:35.105 --> 09:36.100
Wait, wait, what?

09:36.166 --> 09:37.633
I thought you got the note.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.702
No, no, no. I got the "Angry
Nudfo Chocolate Love" note.

09:39.768 --> 09:42.362
I didn't get the one about
Ryan following Volchok.
What?

09:42.436 --> 09:44.332
It's an anagram.
Oh, yeah?

09:44.407 --> 09:46.000
Well, since when
is there a G in Ryan?

09:46.068 --> 09:47.533
I was in a rush;
I had to add a few letters

09:47.607 --> 09:48.532
so it made sense.

09:48.606 --> 09:49.831
Well, you certainly succeeded

09:49.907 --> 09:51.630
'cause this thing is
about as clear as mud.

09:51.706 --> 09:53.231
"Ryan found Volchok."

09:53.308 --> 09:55.262
Of course.

09:56.368 --> 09:57.602
Where are you?

09:57.666 --> 09:58.600
Okay, don't freak out.

09:58.667 --> 09:59.601
Please say Newport.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.031
We're in Mexico.

10:02.107 --> 10:03.701
He didn't say Newport,
did he?

10:03.767 --> 10:05.001
We're at a gas station
outside Ensenada,

10:05.066 --> 10:07.560
but Ryan promises he just wants
to see Volchok.

10:07.636 --> 10:09.261
I want you guys
back here right now.

10:09.338 --> 10:11.461
No offense, Dad, but that
may be a tad unrealistic.

10:11.537 --> 10:12.731
Let me talk to Ryan.

10:12.808 --> 10:14.101
Yeah, I got to go;
I'll call you later.

10:14.168 --> 10:15.801
Seth!

10:15.868 --> 10:18.163
Hey, I was just leaving
Summer a message.

10:18.237 --> 10:19.702
<i>You ready to, uh, ándale?</i>

10:19.767 --> 10:21.131
What did you tell Sandy?

10:21.206 --> 10:22.131
Uh...

10:22.208 --> 10:23.331
Ah.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.762
Did you tell him about Volchok?

10:24.838 --> 10:27.762
Yeah, I did,
and honestly, I'm glad

10:27.837 --> 10:29.232
because you're starting
to freak me out.

10:29.306 --> 10:30.051
I know you want
to kill him.

10:30.235 --> 10:33.492
Yeah, I do...
but I'm not going to, all right?

10:33.706 --> 10:35.203
You either trust me
on that or you don't.

10:36.707 --> 10:38.190
All right, I trust you.

10:39.877 --> 10:41.740
All right, let's go
to Ensenada and find him.

10:41.776 --> 10:43.101
But I can't keep
watching you to make sure

10:43.285 --> 10:44.432
you're not
calling your dad.

10:45.836 --> 10:48.531
It's going to be
kind of hard now.

10:50.068 --> 10:52.802
Ow, you cut me.
So stop moving.

10:52.865 --> 10:54.000
(sighs)

10:54.065 --> 10:56.461
You guys are gayer
than your dad.

10:56.537 --> 10:58.700
It's for water polo,
coach's orders.

10:58.768 --> 11:00.033
That doesn't make it
any less gay.

11:00.105 --> 11:02.401
Yeah, well, our brother
slept with your mom.

11:02.468 --> 11:03.433
Yeah.

11:03.506 --> 11:04.630
Nice try.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.201
Big gay dad trumps slutty mom.

11:06.268 --> 11:08.160
No, it doesn't.
Yeah, ask anybody.

11:08.237 --> 11:10.132
Gay dad always trumps
slutty mom.

11:10.208 --> 11:11.703
Dude,  come on,
it's burning.

11:11.765 --> 11:12.862
It's all right.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.630
Hey, did you talk
to your mom

11:14.706 --> 11:16.401
about, uh, Dr. Roberts
and his ex-wife?

11:16.507 --> 11:18.702
No. He's at a conference
in Seattle,

11:18.767 --> 11:20.402
and I'm sure totally alone.

11:22.236 --> 11:23.403
Here you are.

11:23.466 --> 11:24.530
You are so...

11:26.708 --> 11:28.002
What are they doing?

11:28.067 --> 11:29.733
Their dad's gay.

11:29.806 --> 11:31.031
BOTH:
Hey, Miss Cooper.

11:33.607 --> 11:35.402
I just thought
you'd like to know

11:35.468 --> 11:38.061
that I just got called in
to Dean Torres' office,

11:38.138 --> 11:40.861
and because of you, I have
to work the clothing drive.

11:40.937 --> 11:42.132
No way.

11:42.207 --> 11:43.302
That's too funny.

11:43.367 --> 11:44.560
I'm glad you think so.

11:44.635 --> 11:46.660
I'll see you there at 6:00.
What?!

11:46.738 --> 11:48.233
6:00 o'clock. No arguments.

11:49.408 --> 11:52.361
Stop hitting on Mr. Castle.

12:06.438 --> 12:08.861
You're giving away
Ryan's leather jacket?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.733
He's not going
to be happy.

12:10.808 --> 12:12.701
Well, he told me I could.

12:12.768 --> 12:14.332
Wait a minute,
this one's mine.

12:14.406 --> 12:16.131
I love wearing
this jacket.

12:16.205 --> 12:18.232
That's the problem.

12:19.858 --> 12:20.863
They didn't call.

12:23.167 --> 12:24.901
I just... I feel so...

12:24.967 --> 12:28.402
Honey, Seth is going
to call back,

12:28.467 --> 12:31.430
and then we'll get
some real information,

12:31.506 --> 12:34.100
and then we can
do something.

12:36.108 --> 12:37.432
I'm going to take this
over to Harbor.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.230
Will you call me
if anything...

12:38.306 --> 12:39.433
Of course.

12:40.566 --> 12:41.562
Do you want your jacket back?

12:41.608 --> 12:44.160
No... but thanks.

12:45.826 --> 12:46.863
Can I give you a hand?

12:46.908 --> 12:49.101
No... but thanks.

13:05.456 --> 13:06.442
SETH:
Oh.

13:06.508 --> 13:09.432
So this is what 15 bucks
buys you in Ensenada.

13:09.505 --> 13:10.763
Well, it's only
for a couple hours.

13:11.445 --> 13:12.362
And we're here because?

13:12.517 --> 13:14.652
Well, I only know
the bar he works at.

13:14.825 --> 13:16.841
But he only works nights,
and, uh,

13:17.267 --> 13:19.491
I don't want him seeing us
walking around during the day.

13:19.446 --> 13:20.912
Fair enough. I'm going
to use the restroom.

13:20.997 --> 13:24.372
I did not want to go numero
dos in the gas station.

13:24.406 --> 13:25.961
It's all yours.

13:26.035 --> 13:28.470
Wow, the decorator
clearly spent all
her time in here.

13:28.715 --> 13:30.843
Whoa, man, you got to
come see this spider.

13:30.958 --> 13:35.112
It's uh... Ryan, could you bring
a magazine or a chair, Ryan?

13:37.405 --> 13:38.710
Ryan?

13:38.748 --> 13:40.700
Oh.

14:03.915 --> 14:06.790
Hey, this ain't
the bathroom, man.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.233
You need something?

14:12.307 --> 14:14.563
Does a guy named
Volchok work here?

14:14.636 --> 14:16.482
Used to. Fired his ass.

14:16.638 --> 14:17.871
Yeah? You know
where I can find him?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.231
Yeah, man, let me
check my Rolodex.

14:19.338 --> 14:21.300
Hell, no.
Anybody else know?

14:23.565 --> 14:26.303
Hey, this guy's
looking for Volchok.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.962
You know
where he's at?

14:28.036 --> 14:30.630
The guy's gone.

14:30.708 --> 14:33.000
Maybe you
should be, too.

14:33.066 --> 14:34.660
That's like a hint, bro.

14:57.768 --> 14:59.293
Oh, hi. I'm Taylor.

14:59.387 --> 15:01.703
I'm one of Summer's
friends from Newport.

15:01.745 --> 15:03.901
Amber, Summer's
roommate.

15:03.968 --> 15:07.392
Oh, we must have missed
each other last night.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.803
Yeah, I didn't make it home.

15:09.807 --> 15:12.423
Got ya. College. Very cool.

15:12.668 --> 15:13.960
So, uh,

15:14.037 --> 15:18.122
Summer's really gotten into this
whole green planet thing, huh?

15:18.057 --> 15:19.382
Still, you'd think
she would have

15:19.516 --> 15:21.713
at least one picture
of her friends, right?

15:22.005 --> 15:23.752
I mean, look
at your nice

15:23.808 --> 15:25.012
c ollage.

15:25.375 --> 15:26.943
Who are all those guys?

15:27.308 --> 15:28.653
That's my boyfriend.

15:28.686 --> 15:30.200
He goes to Penn.

15:30.605 --> 15:32.262
The others
are just guys.

15:34.705 --> 15:36.021
Guys like...?

15:37.295 --> 15:37.640
Oh.

15:37.665 --> 15:39.390
You think I'm a slut, don't you?

15:39.638 --> 15:41.593
No. No, of course not.

15:41.638 --> 15:42.573
Sure you do.

15:42.807 --> 15:44.360
It's not your fault,
it's society.

15:44.668 --> 15:47.040
A guy can sleep with as
many girls as he wants.

15:47.097 --> 15:48.561
A girl does it, she's a slut.

15:49.037 --> 15:50.943
There's three guys
in that picture.

15:51.257 --> 15:52.390
AMBER:
Oh, relax.

15:52.646 --> 15:54.330
I put this up
for my social taboo class

15:54.138 --> 15:55.812
to see how people would respond.

15:56.307 --> 15:57.082
I didn't sleep with them all.

15:57.267 --> 15:59.372
Well, that's a relief.
Most are just oral sex.

16:00.718 --> 16:03.201
Well, that's
a very nice collage.

16:03.448 --> 16:05.980
And it only highlights
how impersonal

16:05.916 --> 16:07.353
Summer's side
of the room is.

16:07.808 --> 16:08.462
She doesn't even have

16:08.648 --> 16:10.223
a single picture
of her boyfriend.

16:10.398 --> 16:12.183
Summer has a boyfriend?

16:12.797 --> 16:13.941
You mean Che?

16:14.806 --> 16:16.691
Who's Che?

16:28.026 --> 16:29.301
Well, excuse me.

16:29.486 --> 16:31.631
I-I was...
I was, um...

16:33.296 --> 16:34.270
USMC!

16:36.276 --> 16:37.910
USMC!

16:41.266 --> 16:43.153
Excuse me, I don't want to... I don't
want to bother you.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.150
I was just
wondering...

16:43.917 --> 16:46.472
What? Stop stuttering.

16:46.708 --> 16:49.582
Okay, uh, a friend
of mine's in trouble,

16:49.565 --> 16:50.930
and I can't leave
without him, so I...

16:50.896 --> 16:52.250
Did you hear what he said?

16:53.046 --> 16:55.332
Uh, you know what? You
guys are busy, so...

16:55.407 --> 16:57.430
Never leave a man behind!

16:57.655 --> 16:59.522
ALL:
Never leave a man behind!

17:00.036 --> 17:01.632
Never!
Man.

17:01.707 --> 17:03.001
I love you, man.

17:03.068 --> 17:04.000
Yeah.

17:04.067 --> 17:04.963
We love you.

17:05.037 --> 17:06.463
I love this guy!

17:06.536 --> 17:08.241
We're doing shots!

17:08.265 --> 17:09.051
ALL:
Shots!

17:09.096 --> 17:09.770
(hooting and chatter)

17:10.765 --> 17:13.421
Time! I got to find my buddy,
so why don't you guys do shots?

17:13.484 --> 17:15.040
First we do shots.

17:15.436 --> 17:17.242
Then we find
your friend.

17:17.425 --> 17:19.490
I mean, we're brothers, right?

17:19.655 --> 17:21.160
Oh, well, that's a
little fast, but...

17:21.397 --> 17:22.801
And then we get tattoos!

17:22.655 --> 17:24.053
ALL:
Tattoos!

17:24.646 --> 17:26.800
Great. This is
great. This is...

17:30.265 --> 17:31.613
Mom, I mean it.

17:31.777 --> 17:33.313
I really have
to go study.

17:33.266 --> 17:34.491
Please, honey.

17:34.565 --> 17:36.733
At least come up
with an excuse I believe.

17:38.136 --> 17:40.600
This is nice.

17:40.665 --> 17:43.533
So why don't you try it on?

17:43.607 --> 17:46.763
Because it's not a sample sale,
Kaitlin, it's for the refugees.

17:46.838 --> 17:48.400
The very
lucky refugees.

17:48.466 --> 17:49.883
Tell me about it.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.421
Oh, hi, Julie.

17:51.795 --> 17:54.181
I didn't know you
were doing this.
Hey, Kirsten.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.400
Well, you know,
got to stay involved.

17:56.468 --> 17:57.281
But look at you.

17:57.306 --> 17:59.321
I mean, your kids don't
even go here anymore.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.003
Right.

18:03.267 --> 18:04.481
Something wrong?

18:05.857 --> 18:07.870
The boys went
to Mexico without asking us.

18:08.157 --> 18:09.493
I'm sure they're
fine, but...

18:09.385 --> 18:11.482
Wait. Seth went, too? Why...?

18:13.046 --> 18:16.260
I mean, he just doesn't seem
like Mr. Donkey show.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.740
Not that they're
at a donkey show,

18:18.696 --> 18:20.871
or-or even know
what-what a donkey show...

18:21.087 --> 18:23.501
Have you seen how great some
of these clothes are?

18:24.956 --> 18:25.743
Excuse me.

18:28.745 --> 18:30.433
What's a donkey show?

18:31.477 --> 18:32.970
That's a question
for your mother.

18:33.536 --> 18:34.223
Hello?

18:34.267 --> 18:35.213
He wasn't there.

18:35.416 --> 18:36.060
What?

18:36.265 --> 18:37.161
He got fired.

18:37.297 --> 18:38.532
Nobody knows where he is.

18:39.545 --> 18:40.371
But he was supposed to be there.

18:40.586 --> 18:41.400
He has to be there.

18:41.737 --> 18:42.091
Uh, I'll keep looking.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.472
I'll call you
if I find anything.

18:54.825 --> 18:56.561
I hope everything's okay.

18:57.045 --> 18:58.853
Maybe it was
just Dr. Roberts.

18:58.938 --> 19:02.163
He could have some
bad news or something.

19:10.186 --> 19:10.852
Move it, hippies.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.341
And in the Himalayan
kingdom of Bhutan,

19:12.405 --> 19:14.162
they don't even have a
gross national product.

19:14.316 --> 19:16.873
They measure gross
national happiness.

19:17.296 --> 19:18.851
Isn't that
just beautiful ?

19:19.296 --> 19:21.751
Taylor, hey. Uh,
you can have my bed tonight,

19:21.796 --> 19:22.891
'cause I'm going
to spend the night out here.

19:22.926 --> 19:23.530
Uh-huh. I need to talk to you.

19:23.888 --> 19:26.222
Wait. Taylor, hold.
Can't your secret wait?

19:26.255 --> 19:27.761
This isn't
about that, Summer.

19:27.836 --> 19:29.832
What is going on with you
and that Che character?

19:29.907 --> 19:31.163
That Che character?

19:31.235 --> 19:32.530
What are you talking about?

19:32.608 --> 19:34.781
I have eyes, Summer, and ears,

19:34.928 --> 19:37.123
and I don't like what I'm
hearing, or what I'm seeing.

19:37.735 --> 19:38.921
Okay, maybe that makes sense
in French,

19:39.037 --> 19:40.282
but not so much in English.

19:40.327 --> 19:41.262
Have you called Seth back?

19:42.737 --> 19:44.302
You haven't, have you?

19:44.367 --> 19:46.000
Summer, uh,

19:46.066 --> 19:47.502
my chains are coming loose.

19:48.865 --> 19:50.532
I'll call him later, okay?
I'm busy.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.031
You need to talk to him now.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.100
Look, they're going to
cut down this tree, Taylor!

19:54.167 --> 19:55.700
Well, then we'll have a fire.

19:55.765 --> 19:56.901
Talk to him.

19:58.605 --> 20:00.931
Unless you're afraid that
Johnny Appleseed might overhear.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.561
Hello?

20:05.385 --> 20:06.071
Seth?

20:07.297 --> 20:08.902
It's some Mexican guy. Happy?

20:08.876 --> 20:09.831
What?

20:10.666 --> 20:11.591
Seth?

20:18.315 --> 20:20.603
USMC! USMC!

20:20.666 --> 20:23.002
USMC! USMC!

20:23.066 --> 20:24.562
You drink now, pansy!

20:24.635 --> 20:26.931
Oh, this is good.
Double Bob.

20:27.007 --> 20:28.761
You're staying
with us, pal.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.060
You ain't going anywhere.

20:32.406 --> 20:33.333
Mmm.

20:33.408 --> 20:34.461
One more shot.

20:34.536 --> 20:35.502
One more shot.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.202
You're about to do that shot,

20:37.266 --> 20:39.933
or there's going to be about
six marines kicking your ass.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.932
USMC! USMC!

20:42.008 --> 20:44.932
Wait. Maybe just one more shot.

20:48.295 --> 20:50.433
We're doing the right thing
in trusting them.

20:50.898 --> 20:51.832
I know.

20:53.598 --> 20:54.932
They're adults.

20:55.728 --> 20:57.802
We couldn't have
stopped them if we tried.

20:59.036 --> 20:59.913
I know.

21:01.507 --> 21:02.802
I'm going to Mexico.

21:02.865 --> 21:04.501
I'm going with you.

21:16.996 --> 21:18.311
Uh, excuse me.

21:18.835 --> 21:19.811
What do you want?

21:19.957 --> 21:21.203
Nothing, actually.

21:21.245 --> 21:22.002
18 tequilas

21:22.067 --> 21:23.160
is my limit.

21:23.236 --> 21:24.501
I'm looking for my friend Ryan.

21:24.568 --> 21:26.200
Uh, he's-he's about...

21:26.268 --> 21:27.333
He's about...

21:28.596 --> 21:29.543
He's in there
somewhere,

21:29.556 --> 21:30.863
and he's... and
he's looking

21:30.898 --> 21:32.880
for a guy named Volchok.

21:33.457 --> 21:34.390
He kind of

21:34.436 --> 21:36.042
killed his girlfriend.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.230
Leave.

21:38.307 --> 21:39.530
I've got a tattoo, pal.

21:39.608 --> 21:40.600
A tattoo!

21:40.668 --> 21:41.832
Now!

21:41.907 --> 21:43.163
Okay.

21:58.135 --> 21:59.061
Hey.

21:59.195 --> 22:00.863
Your friend was here earlier.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.393
You know where he went?

22:04.428 --> 22:07.661
Because that guy in there was,
like, very unhelpful.

22:08.537 --> 22:09.321
Is that true?

22:09.567 --> 22:10.861
That Volchok killed a girl?

22:11.995 --> 22:12.981
Yes.

22:13.778 --> 22:15.232
I know where he is.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.630
So now what?

22:17.706 --> 22:19.302
Ryan's not answering
his phone,

22:19.368 --> 22:20.763
and we keep getting
that Mexican guy

22:20.835 --> 22:22.103
every time you call Seth.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.403
Well, at least we know
our phones work here.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.701
So they can reach us.

22:24.767 --> 22:26.131
I say we just start
pounding the pavement,

22:26.205 --> 22:28.560
or the-the dirt,
as the case may be.

22:28.637 --> 22:29.632
Were we crazy coming here?

22:29.707 --> 22:30.471
Driving all night

22:30.627 --> 22:31.451
into a foreign country

22:31.517 --> 22:32.861
where neither of us
speak the language

22:32.886 --> 22:36.040
and where we only have a vague
notion of-of where they are?

22:36.207 --> 22:37.723
Yeah, that's
a little crazy.

22:38.365 --> 22:40.401
How much longer
do we keep doing this?

22:40.467 --> 22:43.332
Rescuing them every time
they're in trouble.

22:43.407 --> 22:44.461
Oh, I don't know.

22:44.538 --> 22:47.603
But for now,
I think that's our job.

22:49.366 --> 22:51.901
I want you to know that I took
two semesters of Spanish.

22:51.965 --> 22:54.001
Well, then you
can be our tour guide.

23:12.707 --> 23:14.202
Hi. Hi.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.963
Um, do you, uh...

23:17.038 --> 23:18.463
I'm so thirsty.

23:18.538 --> 23:21.832
Did you see my friend come
in last night by any chance?

23:21.906 --> 23:23.762
I'm in the room without windows.

23:25.038 --> 23:28.132
Well, how many rooms do you have
without windows?

23:28.208 --> 23:30.132
I see.

23:30.206 --> 23:34.931
Um, could I place a call
to America, please?

23:35.005 --> 23:39.300
Lo se, Miguel,
pero alomejor Maria solo

23:39.368 --> 23:41.602
<i>esta pasando por una etapa.</i>

23:41.666 --> 23:43.832
<i>Si.</i>

23:43.906 --> 23:45.433
<i>Uh, me-me tengo que ir.</i>

23:46.508 --> 23:47.603
Who are you
talking to?

23:47.666 --> 23:48.962
Oh, Miguel.

23:49.038 --> 23:50.763
The guy with Seth's phone.

23:50.836 --> 23:52.203
He is having problems
with his girlfriend.

23:52.267 --> 23:53.930
Taylor...

23:54.008 --> 23:55.263
Where you going?

23:55.338 --> 23:56.601
Back to Newport.

23:57.048 --> 23:59.540
I realized that my problems
are not going to be solved here.

23:59.887 --> 24:00.793
Because the truth is,

24:00.906 --> 24:02.992
you need help
far more than I do.

24:03.367 --> 24:04.532
Hmm.

24:04.606 --> 24:07.263
God, have you ever tried
sleeping outside?

24:07.338 --> 24:10.433
There is so much grass and you
can't turn off the stars.

24:10.507 --> 24:13.862
Look, you want to be the next
Julia Butterfly Hill,

24:13.937 --> 24:15.201
I support that.

24:15.267 --> 24:16.930
But to push away

24:17.006 --> 24:19.463
Seth for some guy
who read Siddhartha

24:19.535 --> 24:21.033
and did a couple
of outward bound

24:21.106 --> 24:22.002
courses.

24:22.066 --> 24:23.162
Are you talking about Che?

24:23.237 --> 24:24.863
Che is just my friend
and that is all.

24:24.995 --> 24:26.091
This is not a love triangle.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.623
I don't do love triangles
anymore.

24:27.737 --> 24:30.263
Fine, but you're using him

24:30.337 --> 24:32.003
and all of this
save the Earth stuff

24:32.068 --> 24:33.900
to hide from Seth.

24:33.968 --> 24:35.803
I'm not hiding from Seth.

24:35.865 --> 24:36.833
Really?

24:36.908 --> 24:38.401
Well, how often do you call him?

24:38.466 --> 24:40.162
Once a week?

24:40.237 --> 24:42.261
Once a month?

24:42.335 --> 24:44.033
Summer, just talk to me.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.061
Or better yet, talk to Seth.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.801
Write him a letter.

24:47.867 --> 24:49.862
But you have to tell him
what you're going through.

24:49.938 --> 24:51.302
He'll understand.

24:52.566 --> 24:54.663
I think you spent too much time
in France,

24:54.738 --> 24:57.330
because here in America,
we hide our feelings.

24:58.397 --> 25:01.022
And since when did saving the
Earth become such a bad thing?

25:01.137 --> 25:02.321
I never said that.
No, but

25:02.455 --> 25:04.120
you came here
with this big secret,

25:04.338 --> 25:05.631
but you've spent the whole time

25:05.707 --> 25:07.162
telling me
what's wrong with my life!

25:07.235 --> 25:09.063
And you're the one that's
avoiding, avoider!

25:09.138 --> 25:10.260
Be that way.

25:12.968 --> 25:15.100
But you're going
to lose Seth.

25:15.167 --> 25:17.600
And then you'll wish
you listened to me.

25:19.966 --> 25:23.360
And I was going to tell you how
I went to France, got married,

25:23.298 --> 25:25.313
and now I have to get a divorce
from my French husband,

25:25.397 --> 25:26.193
and you would have
found the story

25:26.407 --> 25:27.473
<i>très intéressant.</i>

25:28.335 --> 25:29.502
<i>Au revoir, Summer.</i>

25:31.618 --> 25:32.102
Hey, where did

25:32.417 --> 25:34.620
this stupid espresso machine
come from anyway?

25:34.698 --> 25:35.583
It's a gift!

25:41.766 --> 25:42.872
Hey.

25:42.936 --> 25:44.202
I couldn't find
your toothbrush.

25:44.268 --> 25:45.261
Uh, just don't leave.

25:48.436 --> 25:49.653
So did you kill him?

25:51.336 --> 25:52.530
I mean, that was the plan,
right?

25:52.605 --> 25:53.261
The real plan.

25:53.475 --> 25:55.870
Not the lie you told me
when you said trust me, man?

25:56.205 --> 25:58.232
You-you don't understand.

25:58.646 --> 26:00.182
The guy killed Marissa,
you loved her.

26:00.368 --> 26:01.510
What don't I understand?

26:02.387 --> 26:03.532
No one made you come.

26:04.497 --> 26:05.841
You think I want to be here?

26:05.886 --> 26:07.202
Summer came back
for the first time in months,

26:07.265 --> 26:08.402
left without saying good-bye.

26:08.468 --> 26:09.541
I could be losing her right now.

26:09.835 --> 26:10.532
All right, go home.

26:10.518 --> 26:11.740
That is not the point.

26:15.988 --> 26:16.732
I didn't find him.

26:16.698 --> 26:18.393
Good, great, then let's both
go home together.

26:18.496 --> 26:21.002
And I'm not leaving
until I find him.
So then,

26:21.237 --> 26:22.760
what are you going to do, you
going to stay here forever?

26:22.926 --> 26:23.990
You going to live
in Ensenada?

26:24.356 --> 26:25.811
You going to
open a piñataria?

26:25.967 --> 26:26.590
Huh?

26:26.837 --> 26:28.542
You going to open
a burrito stand?

26:33.785 --> 26:34.630
You know what, fine,
if I tell you

26:34.627 --> 26:36.162
where he is,
you promise not to kill him?

26:37.236 --> 26:40.193
What?
I went to the bar
last night--

26:40.347 --> 26:41.632
I guess one you'd
already been to--

26:41.578 --> 26:44.241
and apparently the waitress
and Volchok had had a thing...

26:44.046 --> 26:47.552
Where is he?
Do you promise
not to do anything?

26:48.597 --> 26:51.042
I'm gonna ask you
one more time-- where is he?

27:03.068 --> 27:04.881
Drop the watermelon, dirtbag!

27:05.286 --> 27:06.361
I will shoot you!

27:15.535 --> 27:16.783
What are you watching?

27:18.736 --> 27:19.990
TV's Dumbest Cops.

27:20.995 --> 27:22.972
Are people in America
really this fat?

27:25.268 --> 27:27.362
You haven't moved in 18 hours.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.062
Is everything okay?

27:30.405 --> 27:31.931
Fine.

27:33.538 --> 27:33.981
The world is

27:34.156 --> 27:35.391
an amoral toilet bowl,

27:35.297 --> 27:37.241
and one day
we'll all be flushed.

27:39.307 --> 27:40.933
Okay, wow.

27:41.008 --> 27:44.533
That was a really uplifting
message for your daughter.

27:44.605 --> 27:47.063
It's better you know now.

27:49.185 --> 27:50.493
Okay.

27:50.537 --> 27:52.702
I'm just gonna go
to the clothing drive.

27:52.768 --> 27:54.251
Why?
Because,

27:54.347 --> 27:56.681
believe it or not,
I actually want a life.

27:57.925 --> 27:59.062
Right now that
means school

27:59.108 --> 28:00.652
and a stupid clothing drive.

28:01.008 --> 28:02.041
So I suck it up.

28:04.665 --> 28:07.032
You know,
some of us are still alive.

29:42.908 --> 29:44.422
I need to talk to you.

29:47.387 --> 29:49.302
Now, this is a surprise.

29:50.447 --> 29:51.520
You alone?

29:51.635 --> 29:52.251
Yeah.

29:53.587 --> 29:54.611
How'd you find me?

29:54.566 --> 29:54.883
The girl you...

29:55.216 --> 29:57.210
worked with,
the waitress at the bar.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.361
Right.

29:59.435 --> 30:01.903
Yeah, her boyfriend
wants to kill me.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.702
Well, he's gonna
have to get in line--
Ryan's in Ensenada.

30:07.745 --> 30:08.983
You didn't tell him where I was?

30:09.485 --> 30:10.553
I thought about it,
but in the end

30:10.668 --> 30:12.310
I gave him the wrong address.

30:14.306 --> 30:15.960
Why you looking out for me?

30:16.035 --> 30:17.933
I'm not. I just
don't want Ryan

30:18.006 --> 30:19.933
to ruin his life
by murdering you.

30:20.008 --> 30:21.260
I'm touched.

30:21.337 --> 30:23.261
So, you just taking off?

30:23.337 --> 30:25.102
Isn't that
why you're here?

30:25.166 --> 30:27.502
Warn me to get out of town?

30:27.566 --> 30:29.603
He's gonna find you again.

30:29.668 --> 30:31.203
Maybe.
So, what, then...

30:31.265 --> 30:32.703
you keep running,
he keeps chasing you,

30:32.768 --> 30:35.063
best-case scenario, you do that
for the rest of your lives?

30:35.135 --> 30:37.100
Till I get tired
of running, yeah.

30:38.708 --> 30:40.763
You should turn yourself in.

30:42.126 --> 30:43.130
There's an idea.

30:43.025 --> 30:45.030
My dad's a lawyer-- he could
help you get a good deal.

30:44.975 --> 30:46.732
It'd still be prison.
He could make sure

30:46.965 --> 30:48.170
you're in a safe place.

30:50.308 --> 30:51.803
You know, this reunion

30:51.867 --> 30:53.060
has been great, it really has.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.863
But... I got to go.

30:55.338 --> 30:56.410
You can't keep
running from this.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.093
Let's see if your boy
can find me again.

30:58.298 --> 30:59.101
I'm not talking about Ryan.

30:59.325 --> 31:00.641
You should let my dad help you.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.901
You didn't mean to kill her.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.930
I know. But she's dead.

31:08.005 --> 31:10.400
That's all that matters.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.100
Seth set me up, didn't he?

31:24.086 --> 31:25.631
He called; he was worried.

31:26.017 --> 31:27.530
Come on, let's go home.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.891
Why? So we can pretend
like everything's

31:30.077 --> 31:31.922
the way it used to be?
We all miss her.

31:31.858 --> 31:33.653
It's never gonna be the way
that it used to be.

31:33.556 --> 31:35.442
But we are still a family.

31:37.038 --> 31:38.961
You don't understand. He's here.

31:39.037 --> 31:42.000
SETH:
No.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.000
He's gone.

32:00.726 --> 32:01.830
Taylor?

32:02.648 --> 32:04.670
Don't worry,
Summer, I'm leaving.

32:04.806 --> 32:08.132
I was just postponing the trauma
of going though security.

32:08.208 --> 32:10.563
Look, I'm... I'm so sorry.

32:10.636 --> 32:12.800
Oh, my God, I am, too.

32:12.868 --> 32:14.521
Oh, I don't want
to fight with you.

32:15.146 --> 32:17.103
Even if you are all
gross and smelly.

32:17.866 --> 32:20.200
And you can show up
on my doorstep anytime.

32:20.368 --> 32:23.301
And how you live your life
is your business.

32:23.368 --> 32:25.680
No, you were right.

32:25.876 --> 32:27.511
You are in love with Che?
No.

32:27.986 --> 32:29.332
No, about the Seth thing.

32:29.766 --> 32:31.863
I have been pulling away.

32:33.036 --> 32:33.693
It's just...

32:33.588 --> 32:34.753
Summer, I understand.

32:35.498 --> 32:36.723
But Seth will, too.

32:37.677 --> 32:39.410
Just try.

32:42.276 --> 32:42.773
So when you said

32:42.955 --> 32:45.113
that, uh, you got married,
did that mean that, um...

32:45.155 --> 32:49.670
Yeah, um, I am now Madame
Taylor Townsend DeMemorol.

32:49.508 --> 32:51.210
Oh, my God. But how?

32:51.366 --> 32:52.870
I keep asking myself
the same question.

32:53.136 --> 32:54.370
I-I met him,
and the next thing I knew,

32:54.556 --> 32:56.532
we were in his family's chapel
in Burgundy saying...

32:57.405 --> 32:59.630
I remember telling Ethan Hawke
at the rehearsal dinner...

32:59.818 --> 33:01.200
Ethan Hawke was
at your rehearsal dinner?

33:01.155 --> 33:03.133
Oh, yes. Henri
Michel translated
one of his novels

33:02.935 --> 33:04.611
into French as a
joke, of course,

33:04.916 --> 33:06.142
but don't tell
Ethan that.

33:08.766 --> 33:10.830
Um, I got to go.

33:11.535 --> 33:13.781
But Taylor, you got married.

33:14.268 --> 33:15.862
It was Paris.

33:15.935 --> 33:18.032
It seemed like the thing to do.

33:18.755 --> 33:20.111
Okay, promise me
you'll write to Seth?

33:21.356 --> 33:23.271
Okay, see you
at Thanksgiving.

33:24.337 --> 33:25.803
Bye.

33:25.866 --> 33:27.441
Oh, by the way,
your roommate is a big slut.

33:27.686 --> 33:28.152
Yeah, I know.

33:28.275 --> 33:28.911
Okay.

33:37.967 --> 33:39.723
Will you guys hurry up?

33:39.967 --> 33:42.132
Check out these awesome
leather jackets we found.

33:42.206 --> 33:44.063
Your dad would be
extremely proud.

33:44.136 --> 33:44.851
Now can we go?

33:44.876 --> 33:47.463
Kaitlin?
Mom.

33:48.105 --> 33:50.063
What are you doing here?

33:50.138 --> 33:54.432
Well, uh, what you said earlier
struck a nerve.

33:54.506 --> 33:55.701
Life might
be difficult,

33:55.767 --> 33:58.502
but it's our job to
make the best of it.

33:58.565 --> 33:59.760
You inspired me.

33:59.836 --> 34:01.162
So, what are you doing?

34:01.235 --> 34:02.762
How can I help?

34:02.838 --> 34:06.100
Um, well, the school promised
a local shelter some clothes,

34:06.167 --> 34:07.830
so we're just
bringing them over.

34:07.906 --> 34:10.632
But I think we have it handled.

34:10.705 --> 34:11.659
Yeah, we got it.

34:11.735 --> 34:13.201
Thanks, Miss Cooper.
Oh, okay.

34:13.264 --> 34:14.902
Julie,

34:14.966 --> 34:16.063
I'm glad you're here.

34:16.135 --> 34:17.860
Can I talk to
you for a second?

34:17.936 --> 34:20.231
Mm-hmm. Okay.

34:26.505 --> 34:27.732
I don't know how to say this,

34:27.876 --> 34:30.931
but this afternoon
Amy Bennett found two tops

34:30.976 --> 34:33.851
she donated at a used
clothing boutique.

34:34.987 --> 34:36.643
Amy Bennett buys used clothing?

34:36.648 --> 34:39.172
Julie, someone has
been stealing clothes

34:39.295 --> 34:40.702
from the drive and selling them.

34:41.005 --> 34:42.523
But who would do...?

34:44.936 --> 34:46.132
Oh, no.

34:47.638 --> 34:48.780
Oh, crap.

34:54.505 --> 34:56.031
"Dear, Seth,

34:56.107 --> 35:00.331
<i>I know you think I've changed,
and I'm avoiding you..."</i>

35:00.406 --> 35:01.833
(sighs)

35:05.406 --> 35:06.351
<i>"Dear, Seth..."</i>

35:10.706 --> 35:11.883
<i>"Dear, Seth,</i>

35:12.768 --> 35:16.001
<i>the reason I've been
so distant is that..."</i>

35:18.267 --> 35:21.461
<i>"The truth is..."</i>

35:21.535 --> 35:23.761
<i>"The truth is..."</i>

35:25.406 --> 35:29.063
Seth, I still love you.

35:29.135 --> 35:31.361
I really, really still love you.

35:31.437 --> 35:33.461
I just can't...

35:35.205 --> 35:37.533
Oh, I just can't.

35:40.436 --> 35:41.760
Thanks for driving.

35:41.838 --> 35:43.400
I didn't get much sleep
last night.

35:43.468 --> 35:45.003
Yeah, no problem.

35:47.206 --> 35:48.251
You did the right thing, Seth.

35:48.516 --> 35:49.720
You mean, betraying
my best friend

35:49.656 --> 35:51.251
by ratting him out
to my parents?

35:51.046 --> 35:52.790
You might have saved
his life today.

35:53.175 --> 35:55.510
And sooner or later,
he's going to realize that.

36:00.637 --> 36:02.701
You okay? You hungry?

36:07.487 --> 36:09.251
This was my worst nightmare,

36:10.436 --> 36:11.812
when you first came
to live with us,

36:11.688 --> 36:16.273
that Seth would follow you
somewhere and get hurt.

36:16.096 --> 36:18.121
I know, I shouldn't have
taken him, I'm sorry.

36:18.236 --> 36:20.442
What I was going to say,

36:20.475 --> 36:23.703
all that's changed is now I have
two children to worry about.

36:32.838 --> 36:34.902
Summer, hey,
I am so...

36:34.968 --> 36:36.061
Glad to see me? I know.

36:36.136 --> 36:37.260
Um, I made wheat grass soup

36:37.337 --> 36:39.062
so we can stay out there
all night if have to.

36:39.136 --> 36:41.161
Where you going? We
have a tree to save.
Whoa, Summer, slow down.

36:41.237 --> 36:42.271
But there's no time.
There's no time for anything.

36:42.335 --> 36:43.281
We have to save this tree.

36:44.227 --> 36:45.160
But we did.

36:46.257 --> 36:47.101
The dean just came by.

36:47.067 --> 36:49.162
They're not going to cut
the tree down. We won.

36:50.136 --> 36:51.630
I can't believe this.

36:51.708 --> 36:54.163
Oh, I get your point. What if
they go back on their word?

36:54.235 --> 36:55.402
I told them we'd be watching.

36:55.465 --> 36:56.380
Like a hawk over
the Serengeti,

36:56.645 --> 36:59.562
we'll be watching, so I think
our friend is safe for now.

37:00.115 --> 37:00.970
So, that's it?

37:01.268 --> 37:03.471
Well, I mean, can't we just
go out there anyway?

37:03.557 --> 37:04.782
Oh, I get it.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.353
Why are we only with our tree
friends in times of danger?

37:10.066 --> 37:12.303
Exactly.

37:12.368 --> 37:14.302
That's exactly what I mean.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.100
Yeah.

37:30.405 --> 37:33.631
I could learn a lot
from you, Summer Roberts.

37:38.008 --> 37:40.231
Yeah.

37:48.165 --> 37:50.160
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah, I know.

37:50.306 --> 37:52.402
It... Some marines
were helping me look for Ryan.

37:52.465 --> 37:54.101
It was a bonding thing.

37:54.168 --> 37:56.960
Wow. It's-It's-It's...

37:57.036 --> 37:59.200
You know,
the artwork is really good.

37:59.266 --> 38:00.231
What's this...

38:00.308 --> 38:01.661
What's this say beneath?

38:01.738 --> 38:03.001
Uh, Senorita Vixen.

38:03.067 --> 38:04.762
One of the marines got one, too.

38:04.835 --> 38:06.231
He thought it was pretty cool.

38:06.305 --> 38:08.563
He may have
been ... though.

38:08.637 --> 38:11.361
You know, it does
have a certain...

38:11.436 --> 38:12.743
Gay vibe. Were you going
to say gay vibe?

38:13.065 --> 38:13.920
Exactly.

38:15.037 --> 38:16.531
Let's see
what Summer has to say.

38:20.416 --> 38:21.952
You know, the one thing
I keep thinking about...

38:23.776 --> 38:26.952
...is how Ryan could have found
Volchok in the first place.

38:27.066 --> 38:28.760
Oh, please, just leave me
out of it.

38:28.838 --> 38:30.231
It would have taken
a private investigator,

38:30.307 --> 38:32.261
which means money.

38:32.336 --> 38:34.600
And any way I cut it,

38:34.666 --> 38:38.100
it leads back
to just one person.

38:38.705 --> 38:39.940
There'll be no more hanging out

38:40.118 --> 38:40.890
with Brad and Eric.

38:40.936 --> 38:42.410
You're to come
straight home after school.

38:42.348 --> 38:43.941
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are

38:44.047 --> 38:45.262
that Dean Torres
didn't expel you?

38:45.535 --> 38:47.622
Mom, this whole thing
is just a crock anyway.

38:47.907 --> 38:48.271
And how is that?

38:48.586 --> 38:49.460
Do you really think

38:49.537 --> 38:51.093
that Sudanese refugees

38:51.317 --> 38:53.933
have an overwhelming need
for Paul Frank tops

38:54.248 --> 38:56.210
and last season
Manolo Blahniks?

38:56.258 --> 38:58.303
So, what, you think
you can steal them?

38:58.365 --> 38:59.801
Look, I did research on the Web.

38:59.868 --> 39:01.531
They have mountains
of donated clothing

39:01.606 --> 39:03.133
in warehouses
in New Jersey.

39:03.205 --> 39:04.802
They have all
they've ever needed.

39:05.748 --> 39:06.863
You just made that up.

39:08.347 --> 39:09.041
Maybe.

39:10.616 --> 39:12.021
But it sounded true, didn't it?

39:12.508 --> 39:13.651
Kaitlin...

39:15.755 --> 39:16.502
...I can't do this.

39:16.786 --> 39:17.623
I can't...

39:18.257 --> 39:20.703
I can't keep this family
together

39:20.905 --> 39:23.552
and have you running around
like Miss Clockwork Orange. I...

39:24.748 --> 39:25.691
I can't.

39:25.726 --> 39:27.500
Honey, please.

39:27.568 --> 39:29.533
I need your help.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.433
Mom, do you really think

39:38.506 --> 39:41.202
that Dr. Roberts is
at that conference by himself?

39:44.635 --> 39:47.161
No, of course not.

39:48.938 --> 39:51.360
Look, maybe I can make you
some ice cream...

39:51.437 --> 39:53.793
if you want.

39:55.587 --> 39:56.943
That would be nice.

39:57.756 --> 39:58.902
Just hold on.

40:02.316 --> 40:02.982
Hello?

40:05.136 --> 40:06.701
Yes, of course.

40:06.768 --> 40:09.701
I'll be right there.

40:09.768 --> 40:12.030
Honey, I have to step out
for a minute.

40:12.106 --> 40:14.301
Take a rain check, okay?
Okay.

40:38.696 --> 40:40.423
Sandy, what is it?

40:40.446 --> 40:41.650
You said it was important.

40:41.685 --> 40:42.901
I thought you
might want to know

40:42.967 --> 40:44.830
that Ryan and Seth
are back home,

40:45.998 --> 40:47.532
that Volchok's
disappeared.

40:49.987 --> 40:50.902
What are you talking about?

40:50.966 --> 40:52.163
Stop it.

40:54.206 --> 40:56.303
You told Ryan where
to find Volchok.

40:56.366 --> 40:59.203
Even for you,
this is a new low.

40:59.265 --> 41:01.083
Okay, you know what?
You're crazy.

41:00.995 --> 41:02.202
I'm just going
to say good night.

41:03.145 --> 41:05.411
You sent Ryan down there
to commit a murder.

41:06.048 --> 41:07.870
I could have you arrested.

41:09.048 --> 41:11.302
But then you'd
get Ryan arrested,

41:11.377 --> 41:13.080
and you're not going
to do that, are you?

41:13.097 --> 41:15.240
If anything had happened
to him or to Seth...

41:15.275 --> 41:17.770
Okay, it's late, and I'm not
in the mood for threats.

41:17.777 --> 41:18.563
Sit down.

41:21.167 --> 41:24.430
After everything our
families have been through,

41:24.505 --> 41:27.463
you would put
our kids in danger?

41:30.565 --> 41:32.761
At least you still
have all your kids.

41:54.768 --> 41:55.232
Hey.

41:55.496 --> 41:56.392
How was your drive?

41:56.815 --> 41:59.171
Quiet. Yours?

41:59.747 --> 42:01.212
We got stopped at the border.

42:01.247 --> 42:03.652
I think they had a picture
of dad from his long-hair days.

42:04.956 --> 42:05.812
Did he say anything

42:05.786 --> 42:06.693
about me?

42:06.726 --> 42:08.640
Maybe a rant about Judas?

42:08.948 --> 42:09.991
Of course not.

42:12.146 --> 42:13.050
You okay?

42:13.767 --> 42:17.311
Yeah. It's just been
a long couple of days.

42:18.447 --> 42:20.643
But I'm really
glad you're home.
