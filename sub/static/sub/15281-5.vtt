WEBVTT

00:20.540 --> 00:22.667
Doesn't anybody ever go home?

00:22.670 --> 00:25.821
You're here.
-Exactly. Trust me.

00:25.830 --> 00:28.242
You don't wa_mt to model
your socral life on mIne.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.162
If it makes you feel any better,
Hotch and Morgan took off.

00:31.170 --> 00:33.957
Hotch is married
and Morgan's, you know, Morgan.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.075
What's this?

00:35.080 --> 00:37.287
Police in Dayton, Ohio
need help with a serial rapist.

00:37.290 --> 00:38.450
What's the story?

00:38.460 --> 00:42.783
Three months ago he raped five
students at a small Bible college.

00:42.790 --> 00:46.419
Roughly an attack a week,
then suddenly, nothing.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.706
Until nine days ago
when he suddenly reappeared

00:48.710 --> 00:50.996
with a whole new victim pattern.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.494
Both those women are in their 305.
They were raped about five days apart.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.456
Where have the new attacks
taken place?

00:57.460 --> 00:59.280
Opposite ends of the city.

00:59.290 --> 01:02.248
He was waiting for them
when they got home.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.161
How do we know it's the same guy?

01:05.170 --> 01:06.660
He leaves voice mails for them.

01:07.420 --> 01:10.036
Freezing them with fear
before they even see him.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.577
-They don't recognize the voice?
-No.

01:12.580 --> 01:15.162
Cops even have DNA,
but it's just not in the system.

01:15.170 --> 01:18.412
Why does someone attacking college
students suddenly widen his net?

01:18.420 --> 01:21.457
Serial rapists hardly ever change
victimology once it's established.

01:21.460 --> 01:23.826
It's based on a fantasy
that's very specific.

01:23.830 --> 01:26.162
Maybe he's telling these women
that no one's safe.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.917
Call Hotch and Morgan.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.662
Tell them wheels up as soon
as we're cleared to take off.

01:32.670 --> 01:33.659
Yes, sir.

01:36.920 --> 01:41.209
DAYTON, OHIO

01:42.210 --> 01:44.417
Well. Thanks.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.577
I think we're ready to meet.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.378
Trust me. I know what you want.

02:23.380 --> 02:25.245
-You came home early tonight.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.457
Oh, God. No. No!

03:03.540 --> 03:05.576
Helen Keller once said,

03:05.580 --> 03:10.449
"Although the world is full of suffering,
it is also full of overcoming it."

03:20.580 --> 03:23.458
You tend to forget, don't you?

03:23.460 --> 03:26.827
-What?
-All the different moods on the plane.

03:26.830 --> 03:30.539
I think the mindset's different
when the victims are still alive.

03:30.540 --> 03:33.418
Okay. We got new information
on last night's victim.

03:33.420 --> 03:37.072
Alicia Jordan, 38. MO is the same.
He was waiting for her to get home.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.708
He broke in through the back,
subdued her with a gun.

03:39.710 --> 03:40.825
Answering machine?

03:40.830 --> 03:43.742
Left a message
about an hour or so before.

03:44.460 --> 03:47.952
I can't imagine being taunted like that
in my own house, you know?

03:47.960 --> 03:50.667
Well, the messages aren't taunts.

03:51.040 --> 03:57.115
They're overtures. "I think we're ready."
"Trust me." He's being sincere.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.998
Sounds like we're dealing
with a power-reassurance rapist.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.414
To him, the messages are courtships.
He is introducing himself to the victims.

04:04.420 --> 04:06.661
If that's the case,
he must have stalked them

04:06.670 --> 04:08.661
to know so much about their lives.

04:08.670 --> 04:12.663
The first victims were _
all college students, all religious.

04:13.540 --> 04:14.825
Why change?

04:14.830 --> 04:17.207
Have the police found any connection
between the latest victims?

04:17.210 --> 04:18.871
No, nothing yet.

04:19.540 --> 04:22.919
We have to figure out
what made him go off script.

04:25.170 --> 04:27.821
DAYTON POLICE DEPARTMENT

04:33.620 --> 04:35.918
Maggie Callahan.
I'm the detective on this job.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.411
-Hi. Jason Gideon. How are you?
-Aaron Hotchner.

04:38.420 --> 04:41.241
As soon as he changed victims,
I knew I could use your help.

04:41.620 --> 04:42.826
Your thoughts?

04:42.830 --> 04:44.991
Serial rapists usually
have a set fantasy.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.491
I figured if we can get a handle
on what made him change,

04:47.500 --> 04:49.991
it would give us our best shot
at nailing this guy.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.991
Is there a place
our team could set up?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.786
You got it. In the conference room.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.872
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.998
Agent Gideon. You're going to
have to talk to a lot of victims.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.286
It'd be helpful to have
an extra female presence.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.076
Can you promise me
you'll be sensitive?

05:05.080 --> 05:08.322
As long as you promise to stay
pissed off at what happened to them.

05:08.330 --> 05:10.412
I've been on this case since day one.

05:10.420 --> 05:14.493
-I don't want to have to step aside.
-You will not have to. Thank you.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.287
Dr. Rittman, call the main operator.

05:18.380 --> 05:21.110
Can you roll over
to your other side, please?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.872
Pull your gown down just a little.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.371
Excuse us, please.
MALE TECH: Thank you.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.667
Alicia, we're from the FBI.

05:33.670 --> 05:35.956
I realize you've already spoken
to the police,

05:35.960 --> 05:38.747
but we were hoping
there were a few questions

05:38.750 --> 05:41.071
that you could answer for us.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.039
Every time I think it's over,
someone else wants to photograph me

05:45.040 --> 05:47.952
or touch me or ask me to relive it.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.531
We will keep this short, I promise.

05:52.380 --> 05:53.995
HOLY TRINITY UNIVERSITY OF OHIO

05:54.000 --> 05:55.615
When the attacks first started,

05:55.620 --> 05:58.327
they put guards at all the campus gates
on campus,

05:58.330 --> 06:01.458
but that man still somehow
got In the dorm rooms.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.496
Had you noticed anyone new
on campus?

06:03.500 --> 06:05.115
We've already talked about this.

06:05.120 --> 06:09.375
I know it's hard,
but sometimes it helps to go through it.

06:09.380 --> 06:10.699
Maybe someone quiet

06:10.710 --> 06:13.326
who seemed like
he was always Just a little too close.

06:13.330 --> 06:14.706
I don't think so.

06:14.710 --> 06:18.282
What about anyone
that's suddenly not around anymore?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.201
Before that man did what he did,

06:23.210 --> 06:27.249
he told me I should get a dog
for protection. And then he said,

06:27.250 --> 06:30.413
"Or maybe you could let your parents
have Dexter stay with you."

06:32.250 --> 06:35.788
You said that your attacker
knew the things you thought.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.997
What did you mean by that?

06:40.290 --> 06:42.372
He said that
we weren't the type of people

06:42.380 --> 06:45.031
to just stay inside and read books.

06:45.040 --> 06:49.579
And he talked about taking me away
to Positano, Italy

06:49.580 --> 06:52.663
and drinking white wine
and listening to Al Green.

06:52.670 --> 06:55.116
Is there any significance to that?

06:55.120 --> 06:57.577
My favorite place in the world,

06:57.580 --> 07:01.243
the only alcohol I drink,
and my favorite singer.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.242
I don't understand
how he could know any of it.

07:04.250 --> 07:08.789
Any males in your life that you may
have told about the family dog?

07:08.790 --> 07:12.419
I don't have any experience with boys.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.701
There's no one I would have told.

07:24.580 --> 07:26.457
You need a second?

07:30.290 --> 07:33.248
-It's hard to focus sometimes.
-I know.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.571
The police all act like
just because he didn't kill you,

07:38.580 --> 07:40.241
he didn't somehow end your life.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.992
Did you take my advice
and talk to someone?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.161
There's always a priest
available on campus.

07:47.170 --> 07:48.285
I mean a woman.

07:48.790 --> 07:51.532
I don't know.
Maybe that would be good.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.992
So many lives have been ruined here.

08:02.880 --> 08:08.659
When I went to the doctor,
he said that my injuries were minor.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.952
And you think if they were
somehow worse, it'd be better?

08:15.580 --> 08:17.320
I don't know.

08:19.170 --> 08:20.819
Look at me.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.077
If someone hands _over
a wallet at gunpomt,

08:26.080 --> 08:29.163
everyone thinks that's
the best thing to do.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.616
You did what you had to do to survive.

08:32.620 --> 08:36.659
Don't let anyone tell you different.
All right?

08:38.210 --> 08:39.575
It's okay.

08:42.290 --> 08:45.282
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have
to ask you to listen to this

08:45.290 --> 08:47.667
and tell me if the man's attitude
sounds the same

08:47.670 --> 08:50.412
as when he was in your house.

08:50.420 --> 08:52.991
I think we're ready to meet.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.163
Trust me. I know what you want.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.877
He sounded different.
-How so?

09:01.880 --> 09:04.371
More nervous.

09:04.380 --> 09:09.329
Even though he had a gun,
it was like he was afraid to talk.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.957
Thank you.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.576
What difference does it matter
how he sounded?

09:13.580 --> 09:18.199
On the phone, he can rehearse.
In the flesh, he can't hide his true self.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.991
I don't understand.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.959
In this delusion, the man thinks of
these attacks as dates.

09:26.710 --> 09:28.917
I didn't do anything
to make him think that.

09:28.920 --> 09:29.989
We know you didn't.

09:32.710 --> 09:35.577
-This is enough.
-Thank you very much.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.412
Everybody get some sleep.
We got a big day tomorrow.

10:15.210 --> 10:16.325
What's up?

10:17.830 --> 10:20.162
Oh, I think I left my glasses
in the car.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.376
I'll keep you company.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.110
No, it's all right. We got to get sleep.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.950
Be right there.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.916
I figured
you wouldn't be sleeping either.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.536
-What are you doing here?
-I took a room on the hall.

11:30.540 --> 11:32.110
But you live four blocks away.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.611
Exactly. Why be separated
from the work?

11:40.920 --> 11:43.616
-You stole a bathrobe?
-Complimentary.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.208
I can't get something out of my head.

11:51.210 --> 11:56.375
Cheryl, on campus today. She said,
"So many lives here have been ruined."

11:59.000 --> 12:02.458
-Yeah?
-Only 20% of rapes are even reported.

12:03.710 --> 12:07.168
You think there are more victims
out there?

12:07.170 --> 12:10.458
You figure, a Catholic school,
the percentages are bound to hold.

12:10.460 --> 12:13.497
UnSub's stressor might've been a rape
that never got reported.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.491
Something made him change victims.

12:15.500 --> 12:19.322
Maybe he almost got caught,
maybe he's religious and felt guilty.

12:19.330 --> 12:22.822
Maybe a victim reminded him
of his sister.

12:24.290 --> 12:27.703
Something. What do you think?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.820
I think you got good instincts.

13:12.670 --> 13:14.535
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:16.580 --> 13:19.822
-Are you okay

13:22.120 --> 13:24.748
No. Really. Come right in.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.326
You want to check my ID?

13:36.080 --> 13:39.868
I thought maybe you might want to talk.

13:41.790 --> 13:44.281
Don't go all profiler on me.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.242
Elle, you got shot in your own home

13:48.250 --> 13:52.414
and then you came back to the BAU
like nothing even happened.

13:53.670 --> 13:56.742
Thinking you might want to talk
isn't profiling.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.661
It's Psych 101.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.950
Please?

14:26.040 --> 14:28.452
After he shot me,

14:28.460 --> 14:32.112
he reached into my wound so
he could write on the wall in my blood.

14:35.250 --> 14:42.167
I was barely conscious, but I...
I could feel his hand in there.

14:44.580 --> 14:47.788
And sometimes it's like
I can still feel it.

14:50.620 --> 14:54.454
Elle, he's dead.

14:54.460 --> 14:59.454
You're... You're right here. You won.

15:09.290 --> 15:10.575
Then here's to winning.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.327
Morning.
Thanks for coming in a little early.

15:29.330 --> 15:31.821
-Good morning.
-Lousy coffee's up.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.242
We just want you to hear
what the FBI has gathered

15:34.250 --> 15:35.706
and get you on the streets.

15:35.710 --> 15:37.109
You guys, listen up.

15:37.120 --> 15:41.409
So the guy we're looking for
is a classic power-reassurance rapist.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.615
This differs_ _
from a power-assertive rapist,

15:43.620 --> 15:46.202
who attempts to humiliate
and traumatize his victims.

15:46.210 --> 15:49.247
As well as the anger-retaliatory rapist
and the sexual sadist,

15:49.250 --> 15:51.912
whose attacks are also random
and excesswely brutal.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.070
The reason that's important for you
to know,

15:54.080 --> 15:57.664
he's the only kind of rapist
who targets a specific victim.

15:57.670 --> 16:00.616
He fantasizes that he's in a relationship
with these women.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.110
Now, he doesn't come across them
by accident.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.451
This is someone with access.

16:04.670 --> 16:07.821
He's the cable guy, or the locksmith.

16:09.790 --> 16:11.746
He's the guy who reads the gas meter.

16:11.750 --> 16:15.572
He can describe exactly what these
women wear and how they smell.

16:15.580 --> 16:17.536
These details are
what feed his fantasy.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.247
We need you to look for the
overlap between the sets of victims.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.990
Delivery men, lawn crew, handymen.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.571
Did the school share workers
With any of the recent Victims?

16:24.580 --> 16:26.536
Because he_ sees these
as relationships,

16:26.540 --> 16:28.496
he most likely lives alone.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.991
And living alone allows him
to indulge his delusion

16:31.000 --> 16:33.070
he's in a relationship
with these women.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.412
Because of the discrepancy
in the victims' ages,

16:35.420 --> 16:36.990
we can only pinpoint his age

16:37.000 --> 16:39.992
somewhere between
20 and 40 years old.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.242
It's possible that he has a profession
that he finds emasculating.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.115
So look for someone in their lives
With a job

16:45.120 --> 16:46.872
deviating from normal gender roles.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.245
Something like a secretary.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.741
We're sure that there is some overlap.

16:50.750 --> 16:54.709
This guy is a shadow at the edges
of each of these women's lives.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.450
All right, that's square one.

16:56.460 --> 16:59.452
Re-canvass and be _sure
to relay information on shift change.

16:59.460 --> 17:00.779
Thanks very much.

17:00.790 --> 17:02.166
What's up?

17:02.170 --> 17:04.741
I looked into the idea of rapes
that went unreported,

17:04.750 --> 17:05.990
-|ike you asked.
-And?

17:06.000 --> 17:09.242
Two months ago, a female student
at Holy Trinity committed suicide.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.161
She wasn't one
of the reported victims,

17:11.170 --> 17:13.991
but her suicide corresponds
almost exactly

17:14.000 --> 17:15.820
to when the campus attacks stopped.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.572
Maybe there are more victims
out there.

17:46.330 --> 17:50.448
I don't understand how our
daughter's death is FBI business.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.997
We're investigating
a series of sexual assaults

17:53.000 --> 17:55.537
that took place on Shelly's campus.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.667
Were you aware of the attacks?

17:57.670 --> 18:00.571
Of course. It was horrible.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.459
There's no good way to say this,
so I'm just going to ask.

18:05.380 --> 18:09.669
Is it possible that Shelly was raped
and that led to her suicide?

18:09.670 --> 18:11.160
No, it's not.

18:12.290 --> 18:15.282
Did Shelly have any history
of depression?

18:16.540 --> 18:19.247
She put a lot of pressure on herself.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.874
She got A's,
volunteered with a youth group,

18:23.880 --> 18:27.372
played varsity volleyball in high school.

18:27.380 --> 18:30.167
But she always handled it with grace.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.535
Did she leave a note?

18:35.170 --> 18:39.243
And if so, would it be possible for us
to take it and analyze it?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.490
There wasn't a note.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.076
We will return it.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.072
And with all due respect, this isn't
something I'm asking lightly.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.536
With all due respect to you,

18:49.540 --> 18:51.451
you walk into my home,
you ask if my daughter,

18:51.460 --> 18:54.202
who we buried two months ago,
was also sexually violated.

18:54.210 --> 18:55.575
I'm sorry.

18:56.420 --> 19:00.868
I have a little girl, and I can't say how
I'd react if something happened to her.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.952
But I would like to believe I would do
whatever necessary to make sure

19:03.960 --> 19:06.246
that no other family went through
that same pain.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.660
I'd like to go lie down.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.167
Thank you for your time.

19:17.170 --> 19:18.876
I'll see you out.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.535
I love my wife.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.616
I'm sure you do.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.036
She was raped?

19:48.040 --> 19:49.450
The UnSub got her pregnant.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.492
"I'm choosing the sin of suicide over
the sin of abortion

19:53.500 --> 19:56.242
"because I can't bring his baby
into the world.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.820
"Please don't hate me. Shelly."

19:57.830 --> 19:59.912
The attacks at the college
stopped two months ago,

19:59.920 --> 20:02.957
right after Shelly's suicide.
That had to have been the stressor.

20:02.960 --> 20:07.249
He thinks of these as relationships.
In his mind, Shelly killed their baby.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.161
Jason. Hotch.

20:09.170 --> 20:12.287
We need to go back to the last victim
and ask one more question.

20:13.080 --> 20:16.709
Did he say anything to you
about children, family?

20:17.670 --> 20:19.069
No.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.241
Did he mention anything
about suicide?

20:21.250 --> 20:24.208
He would have referred to it
as though a personal tragedy,

20:24.210 --> 20:26.417
somebody he was maybe
in a relationship with?

20:26.420 --> 20:27.739
Why are you asking me this?

20:29.710 --> 20:31.701
One of the victims took her own life

20:31.710 --> 20:34.827
when she realized
the rapist got her pregnant.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.285
What is it?

20:41.960 --> 20:44.076
I'm trying to have a baby.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.610
For how long?

20:49.670 --> 20:52.742
I had an appointment at the clinic
to talk about insemination

20:52.750 --> 20:55.492
a few days before I was attacked.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.912
Did anyone else know about that?

20:58.670 --> 21:03.664
I'd just decided. I'm 38.

21:05.250 --> 21:10.119
I figured I couldn't afford to just wait
around for the right man to show up.

21:19.620 --> 21:22.168
Hey. I talked to the other two victims
in their 305.

21:22.170 --> 21:25.708
They'd both gone to a fertility clinic
within five days of their attack.

21:25.710 --> 21:27.280
Same one each time?
-Yep.

21:27.290 --> 21:29.246
Have Garcia run down
employment records.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.820
We might be looking
at someone who works there

21:30.830 --> 21:32.661
or who has access
to their medical records.

21:32.670 --> 21:35.241
You got it. What's the significance
of the five days?

21:35.250 --> 21:37.161
The most popular fertility drug
is clomiphene.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.458
The clinic would most likely have
a policy not to attempt insemination

21:40.460 --> 21:42.030
until the drug regimen was complete.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.497
So, then getting there before
they begin the insemination process

21:44.500 --> 21:46.161
would guarantee the UnSub paternity.

21:46.170 --> 21:47.376
He's trying to get them pregnant.

21:47.380 --> 21:50.110
He hasn't changed his fantasy.
He's merely found a way to perfect it.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.997
Well, it explains
the change in victimology.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.991
He's targeted young,
ultra-religious girls

21:54.000 --> 21:55.877
who he assumed
wouldn't want to have an abortion.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.371
So when Shelly killed herself,
he decided to change it up

21:58.380 --> 22:01.531
and go after women
who were desperate to have a baby.

22:01.540 --> 22:03.747
If the UnSub knew Shelly Norvell
was pregnant,

22:05.250 --> 22:08.413
it means he's still watching
his past victims.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.741
Elle. Elle.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.451
Elle.

22:16.380 --> 22:17.574
Talk to Callahan.

22:17.580 --> 22:19.992
Tell her we need patrols
monitoring everyone on that victim list.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.410
You got it.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.279
You ever seen anything
like this before?

22:24.290 --> 22:26.076
Gary Heidnik in Philadelphia.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.412
He kept women in a dungeon prisoner
for years

22:28.420 --> 22:29.785
with the hopes of impregnating them.

22:29.790 --> 22:31.371
Heidnik was a sexual sadist.

22:31.380 --> 22:34.031
He tortured the women
and even ended up eating one of them.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.951
This is a power-reassurance rapist.

22:35.960 --> 22:38.611
So in this guy's twisted mind,
these are love stories?

22:38.620 --> 22:42.249
Of course they are.
He's starting families.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.370
DAYTON HEIGHTS FERTILITY CLINIC

22:54.380 --> 22:56.610
WAGNER: I'm sorry. But whoever's
committing these crimes

22:56.620 --> 22:59.202
couldn't work at this clinic.
I'm the only man here.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.166
But that doesn't mean
that there isn't a connection.

23:01.170 --> 23:03.991
We need your help
to figure out what it might be.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.207
Can you excuse me just a minute?

23:06.210 --> 23:08.280
Can you just fill that out?

23:08.290 --> 23:10.667
That's great. Just right there.

23:11.540 --> 23:14.373
Look, what's happening
is just horrible.

23:14.380 --> 23:17.918
But the margins on a clinic like this
are incredibly slim.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.957
And if word gets out that
there's a connection to this rapist,

23:20.960 --> 23:22.370
my practice would be ruined.

23:22.380 --> 23:24.166
To be honest,
I don't care about your practice.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.206
Three women were raped
after coming here.

23:26.210 --> 23:28.166
That's not a coincidence, it's a pattern.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.577
If you're implying
that I could be a suspect,

23:31.580 --> 23:34.743
I should let you know
that I had a vasectomy 25 years ago.

23:34.750 --> 23:36.240
We just want to know if there's anyone

23:36.250 --> 23:38.957
in and out of this clinic
who fits the profile.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.827
Quiet, lives alone,
awloNard with women,

23:41.830 --> 23:45.118
yet hangs around the office
a little too long just to be near them.

23:45.120 --> 23:48.112
No. It's just a small clinic.
I only hire women.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.998
My patients are just much more
comfortable around them.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.458
What about outsourcing,
computer support

23:55.330 --> 23:57.821
My daughter handles
all the technical business.

23:57.830 --> 24:02.779
And I have a cleaning crew
of two women. I'm sorry.

24:03.380 --> 24:04.950
What is that, Doctor?

24:04.960 --> 24:08.612
It's just a questionnaire we hand out
to learn more about our client base.

24:17.960 --> 24:20.417
This is everything
the UnSub knew about the victims.

24:20.880 --> 24:21.949
Who else sees these?

24:22.540 --> 24:25.418
I don't compromise
the medical privacy of my patients.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.320
Who else sees these?

24:28.120 --> 24:30.748
Well, I sell the forms
to a direct marketing company

24:30.750 --> 24:34.038
called First Hand Media.
They just target buying habits.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.780
No medical information
changes hands.

24:38.330 --> 24:39.957
It's not illegal.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.246
Yeah, but the margins
on a place like this.

24:42.250 --> 24:44.741
Word gets out,
your practice would be ruined.

24:50.670 --> 24:52.319
Dayton, Ohio, you're on the air.

24:52.330 --> 24:53.877
I'd like to make a request.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.030
With that sultry voice? You name it.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.321
All right, listen. It's a marketing firm
by the name of First Hand Media.

25:00.330 --> 25:01.877
I want you to see
if they have any connection

25:01.880 --> 25:04.075
to the colleges from
the first set of victims.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.491
Behold. First Hand Media processes

25:08.920 --> 25:10.376
That's a beautiful thing.

25:10.380 --> 25:11.950
Oh, one last favor.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.747
Look up the words "sew" and "brilliant"
in that computer of yours

25:14.750 --> 25:15.819
and tell me what you come up with.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.116
Look at that. It's me.

25:19.580 --> 25:22.117
You're a goddess, woman. Good job.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.611
It was a... It was a work call.

25:30.170 --> 25:31.876
First Hand Media.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.459
You really think this rapist
is one of my guys?

25:37.460 --> 25:39.166
Well, he's used to being
in strangers' homes,

25:39.170 --> 25:42.287
always on the phone.
That's how he's confident.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.918
Thanks to your research,
he feels like he knows these women.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.615
We're going to need a list of
any employees you have

25:46.620 --> 25:49.498
that worked on the fertility clinic
and university questionnaires.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.913
I give every employee complete access
to all of our materials.

25:52.920 --> 25:56.287
It helps keep them fresh if they can
alternate between types of calls.

25:56.580 --> 25:58.491
So, I fill out
my intimate personal information

25:58.500 --> 26:00.240
and then you just share it
with everyone

26:00.250 --> 26:02.070
you have working here
for minimum wage?

26:02.080 --> 26:03.377
I sense an attitude.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.206
We need copies of
every single questionnaire

26:06.210 --> 26:07.746
that you got from the clinic.

26:08.290 --> 26:11.032
We can get a warrant here
in about an hour, if you prefer.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.324
Look, if you think about it,

26:13.330 --> 26:15.571
all I'm doing is profiling,
just like you guys.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.070
Well, let's not think about it.

26:32.710 --> 26:33.950
All of these?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.700
We cover the entire
Great Lakes region.

26:35.710 --> 26:37.416
Let's narrow it down.
The guy we're looking for

26:37.420 --> 26:39.536
is a male, white,
between the ages of 20 and 40,

26:39.540 --> 26:42.327
socially awkward,
and unable to make connections easily.

26:42.330 --> 26:44.241
I have 250 employees.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.569
Most of those are men

26:45.580 --> 26:49.209
and every single one of them match
the description you just gave me.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.821
Wow. I heard you ran
into a wall of paper.

26:56.830 --> 27:00.459
You can lock your doors, but these
people still find a way into your home.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.325
Elle, it might be worth going back
to the victims.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.991
It's a long shot,
but maybe somebody remembers

27:04.000 --> 27:05.911
a first name from a telemarketing call.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.320
Yeah, the UnSub feels a connection
with them.

27:08.330 --> 27:11.663
So he wouldn't lie or use an alias.

27:11.670 --> 27:13.319
We know this guy's DNA's
not in the system,

27:13.330 --> 27:15.912
but I'll cross check employment records
against sexual misdemeanors.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.411
-Peeping, exposure...
-Good.

27:18.420 --> 27:22.242
I've separated the Dayton forms
from the rest of the region.

27:22.250 --> 27:23.456
Thanks.

27:23.460 --> 27:26.577
So what do we know
from the latest set of victims?

27:26.580 --> 27:29.617
They're all single and all over 35.

27:29.620 --> 27:32.282
Each of them also indicated
recently buying books

27:32.290 --> 27:34.246
on babies and child-rearing.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.241
So he knows they're committed
to having children,

27:36.250 --> 27:39.242
which means they're much less likely
to abort, even in the cases of rape.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.787
Get this. Each of the victims
also checked the "yes'" box

27:41.790 --> 27:44.076
when asked if it would be okay
to contact them

27:44.080 --> 27:46.537
on special deals on pediatric items.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.077
In the UnSub's mind,
they've consented.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.820
He thinks he's doing them a service.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.786
Check those forms
for each of those elements.

27:52.790 --> 27:56.669
If we can narrow down the potential list
of victims, we can be waiting for him.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.747
-Any hits?
-I've got one.

28:06.170 --> 28:08.286
-Is this the only one?
-It's a small city.

28:08.290 --> 28:10.281
There can't be very many
single women in their late 30s

28:10.290 --> 28:12.372
going to the exact same fertility clinic.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.416
So we know who he's going after next.

28:27.250 --> 28:30.208
Hello. Police.
Anybody there?

28:46.170 --> 28:48.070
I guess no one's home.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.707
There was no forced entry.
We're still not sure how he got in.

29:26.710 --> 29:28.029
-MO's the same?
-Yeah.

29:28.040 --> 29:31.077
-I'm going to take a look inside.
-All right.

29:31.080 --> 29:33.617
-What the hell are your men doing

29:33.620 --> 29:35.281
Well, you can have men
outside the door,

29:35.290 --> 29:37.030
but a woman can still get raped inside.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.917
-Elle.
-They knocked, there was no answer.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.491
-There was no legal cause to enter.
-So they just walked away?

29:41.500 --> 29:44.321
No, they left messages that
it was urgent she contact the police.

29:44.330 --> 29:46.571
_ Which must be on the machine
right after that creep left a message

29:46.580 --> 29:48.116
Elle, come on now.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.873
-Elle, what the hell are you doing?
-They did everything in their power.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.917
-You just keep telling yourself that.
-Elle!

29:56.210 --> 29:58.030
Excuse me._ _ _
How bad were her injuries?

29:58.040 --> 30:01.498
-She's lucky. They're relatively minor.
-Do me a favor.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.957
Don't tell her that she's lucky.

30:04.920 --> 30:07.957
There's not a potential victim
in the questionnaires.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.030
Who knows when we're gonna
get another shot at him.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.371
Noose is tightening.

30:11.380 --> 30:12.870
You saw that stack of forms.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.872
This company handles
the entire Great Lakes region.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.495
If he thinks we're close, he can take off

30:17.500 --> 30:21.789
and he's got a whole new list of victims
in another city.

30:21.790 --> 30:23.166
What do you think?

30:23.170 --> 30:26.116
When he started with college students,
he raped one a week.

30:26.120 --> 30:29.169
Now, he has to wait for the right set
of circumstances.

30:29.170 --> 30:31.240
But he wants more victims.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.410
Then let's give him one.

30:34.290 --> 30:38.283
-Do you think Elle's ready for it?
-We'll be there for her.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.377
You're a legal secretary.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.371
Thirty-six. Divorced.

30:51.380 --> 30:54.372
We backdated the questionnaires
two days, so in the UnSub's mind,

30:54.380 --> 30:57.167
he's already behind
his normal schedule.

30:57.170 --> 30:59.035
This guy's itching
for another victim, Elle.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.326
Once he sees that form,
he's gonna want to stake you out.

31:01.330 --> 31:02.877
You need to let him see you.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.871
He wants to know when you leave,
when you come home,

31:04.880 --> 31:06.780
when you have friends over.

31:06.790 --> 31:09.418
He breaks into these houses
when the women are away.

31:09.420 --> 31:10.956
So he needs to see you leave.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.417
All we need to do
is get him to breach that door.

31:17.420 --> 31:18.956
Once we get him
on breaking and entering,

31:18.960 --> 31:22.498
we got reason to get DNA
and his ass is ours.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.786
Another thing. Don't go out
with your gun on. It's too rislq.

31:24.790 --> 31:27.281
-If he sees it, we might lose him.
-Okay.

31:27.290 --> 31:29.747
Keep it someplace inside
so you can get to it easily.

31:29.750 --> 31:30.876
I'm gonna be right out front.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.074
Hotch and Gideon are gonna
be around the corner

31:32.080 --> 31:33.206
in a surveillance van.

31:33.210 --> 31:36.498
And don't forget, you're wired,
so we'll be with you at all times.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.872
Hey. Good?

31:42.330 --> 31:43.740
I'm good.

32:16.620 --> 32:17.666
She's in.

33:17.790 --> 33:20.611
Why isn't she leaving?
She needs to get out of there.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.200
What is that?

33:47.170 --> 33:48.205
Morgan, call her.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.412
Come on. Pick up. Pick up.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.111
I think we might have company.

34:40.750 --> 34:41.910
Talk to me, tiger.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.070
Garcia, I need you
to run a plate for me.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.787
Peter, Mary, six, eight, yellow, three.

34:51.710 --> 34:54.918
William Lee.
10308 Pinehurst Avenue.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.490
Okay. Can you get me
where he works?

34:56.500 --> 34:58.491
Feel my speed.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.876
He works for First Hand Media.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.201
All right. I got it, thanks.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.245
It's him.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.491
-Bingo.
-Alpha Bravo, she's on the move.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.996
What's she doing with her gun on?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.992
Just get in the car.
Don't let him know that you see him.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.116
What the hell's she doing? Easy, baby.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.530
-She's panicking.
-Easy, easy.

36:15.210 --> 36:17.166
No, come on, Elle.
Elle, back off. Back off.

36:17.170 --> 36:18.910
We got no reason to bring him in.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.376
Don't blow it. Don't blow it.

36:23.250 --> 36:25.536
Everybody go!

36:25.540 --> 36:28.828
FBI! Put your hands
where I can see them.

36:29.580 --> 36:32.287
Get out of the car! Right now.
Get on the ground!

36:32.290 --> 36:34.076
I didn't do anything.
-Put your palms up!

36:34.080 --> 36:37.072
I was just checking my...
-Shut up!

36:39.710 --> 36:43.282
I was just stopping
to look at my map.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.991
You got no reason to keep me here.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.706
We know you work
with First Hand Media

37:11.710 --> 37:14.531
and you had access to information
about all these women.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.378
-But I didn't do anything wrong.
-We know that.

37:20.710 --> 37:22.280
I apologize.

37:26.380 --> 37:29.417
We know how much you care
about these women.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.780
You do care about them, don't you?

37:31.790 --> 37:34.327
He's 28 years old
and has a high school diploma,

37:34.330 --> 37:37.117
but he's had 12 jobs
in the past ten years.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.610
-Home life?
-He lived with his mother

37:38.620 --> 37:41.669
until she was diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer six months ago.

37:42.210 --> 37:45.748
One last chance to make Mama proud
by starting a family.

37:45.750 --> 37:48.492
-How are they playing it?
-Deep empathy.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.411
-Smart.
-Yeah, well, it better work.

37:50.420 --> 37:53.617
If they don't get him to confess,
we got no reason to hold him.

37:54.500 --> 37:58.118
We know that dating
those younger girls was a mistake.

37:58.790 --> 38:01.031
They were just too immature.

38:02.210 --> 38:05.919
Olde_r ones are... _ _
They're looking to start families.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.956
I mean, they were even willing
to shell out a lot of money

38:07.960 --> 38:09.109
just to have kids.

38:11.710 --> 38:13.530
Well, let's just say that that's true.

38:13.540 --> 38:17.419
Then whoever would have been
with them would have been helping.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.490
That's what we were saying.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.912
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to them.

38:23.750 --> 38:26.742
Excuse me, where do I find...
-Who's this?

38:28.210 --> 38:29.370
This way? Thank you. Thank you.

38:29.380 --> 38:32.076
Oh, no, no, no. Son of a bitch.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.911
Why don't you volunteer
a DNA sample?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.615
If you were the kid,

38:37.620 --> 38:39.827
wouldn't you want to know
who your father was?

38:43.880 --> 38:47.031
-Don't say another word.
-This is over.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.248
I'm advising my client
not to answer any more questions.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.747
I'm assuming that we're free to go.

39:00.750 --> 39:02.456
Just keep moving.

39:03.710 --> 39:05.780
You're letting him walk?
-Back off, Elle.

39:05.790 --> 39:07.326
You don't know what he's done!

39:07.330 --> 39:09.662
The only reason he's walking
is because you panicked.

39:09.670 --> 39:12.161
I'm supposed to believe
that you've got my back?

39:12.170 --> 39:13.319
What are you saying to me?

39:13.330 --> 39:15.662
The last time you sent me home,
Hotch, you got me shot.

39:15.670 --> 39:17.740
Walk with me. Right now.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.371
You need to get some air.

39:30.710 --> 39:33.918
And while you do,
I want you to think about this job,

39:35.080 --> 39:38.493
what you've been through,
what you're capable of.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.240
Do you understand me?

40:02.750 --> 40:05.378
So, what happens now

40:05.380 --> 40:07.450
You have your man.
You just have to wait for him to slip up.

40:07.460 --> 40:08.575
You said yourself,

40:08.580 --> 40:11.322
he has access to information_
on women for an eight-state region.

40:11.330 --> 40:15.619
Look, you're a good cop.
My money's on you.

40:17.920 --> 40:20.957
Get some rest, my friend.
Wheels up tomorrow at noon.

40:44.580 --> 40:48.823
Is this what you do

40:54.250 --> 40:55.820
You're not supposed to be here.

40:55.830 --> 40:58.572
Oh, you can't talk to a woman
without a gun in your hand?

40:59.120 --> 41:00.997
You and I both know what you are

41:01.000 --> 41:03.457
and you're not gonna
hurt women anymore.

41:03.460 --> 41:07.419
I would never hurt them. You know that.

41:07.420 --> 41:10.036
-It's why you let me go.
-I didn't let you do anything.

41:15.250 --> 41:16.706
You're very pretty.

41:16.710 --> 41:18.075
What did you just say to me?

41:19.880 --> 41:23.748
Why do you choose to do a job
that is so dangerous?

41:23.750 --> 41:25.570
You should find a man
to take care of you.

41:25.580 --> 41:27.411
Oh, like you took care of those women?

41:27.420 --> 41:29.320
Now you're trying to interrogate me.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.617
You know you're not supposed
to do that.

41:32.620 --> 41:37.205
I'm just here to let you know that
I'm not gonna rest until you go away.

41:38.040 --> 41:43.068
No. You're here
because you want me to say thank you.

41:43.790 --> 41:45.746
-You're sick.
-Rea|ly?

41:46.750 --> 41:53.667
Because without you,
I would still be locked up.

41:53.670 --> 41:55.820
I didn't let you walk.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.410
Thank you.

42:09.710 --> 42:11.996
You've made a lot of women
very happy.

42:19.830 --> 42:21.491
Hey, Lee.

42:55.290 --> 42:56.496
What happened?

42:56.500 --> 43:00.413
I was having a conversation with him,
he drew his weapon, and I fired.

43:00.420 --> 43:01.876
You all right?

43:01.880 --> 43:04.075
I am. Thank you.

43:07.750 --> 43:10.742
I can't let you speak to her
until she's been processed. Procedure.

43:10.750 --> 43:13.162
-What happened?
-She came to stake his place out.

43:13.170 --> 43:15.240
He saw her. He had a gun.

43:15.250 --> 43:17.912
Don't worry.
It's cut-and-dry, self-defense.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.911
She'll have her badge back
by tomorrow.

43:19.920 --> 43:21.376
Thank you.

43:22.420 --> 43:24.741
Come on, Elle. Let's go.
