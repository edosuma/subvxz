00:33.208 --> 00:34.374
<i>No shirt.</i>

00:34.374 --> 00:35.374
<i>No shoes.</i>

00:35.666 --> 00:36.666
No service!

Draw straws?

01:03.582 --> 01:05.208
Okay, draw!

01:13.291 --> 01:15.374

01:35.166 --> 01:38.749

them buns with olive oil

01:38.749 --> 01:40.208

01:41.582 --> 01:43.166
You're a riot.

02:08.291 --> 02:09.957
Whoa!

02:13.499 --> 02:15.749
Waa waa waa!

02:15.749 --> 02:17.582
Waa waa waa waa waa waa waaa!

02:18.666 --> 02:19.832
That's not funny!

02:21.915 --> 02:23.666
The boys are supposed
to meet us right here.

02:24.249 --> 02:26.041
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

02:26.041 --> 02:27.457
Yoo-hoo!

02:50.457 --> 02:51.749
What are you, clowning me?

02:51.749 --> 02:52.832
What?

02:52.832 --> 02:54.832
That ain't you.

02:55.915 --> 02:56.874
...and stay out!

03:04.208 --> 03:05.291

03:05.291 --> 03:07.790
Hey, girls! Care for a picnic?

03:07.790 --> 03:08.832
Yay!

03:10.083 --> 03:12.333
Donald?
Hiya, toots.

03:12.333 --> 03:15.166
Oh, my goose down!
You're naked in public!

03:15.166 --> 03:16.333
What is wrong with you?

03:16.333 --> 03:17.832
But, but, but...

03:17.832 --> 03:20.083
Stop! I'm too embarrassed
to even be seen with you.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.832
Now, about that picnic...

03:27.083 --> 03:29.083
Boy, some people ain't got no class.
