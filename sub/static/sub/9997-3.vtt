WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:07.900
Pulse is nonexistent.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.200
Patient's in cardiac arrest.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.800
The cranial pressure's up.

00:10.800 --> 00:11.900
I'm guessing aneurysm.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.900
You're guess aneurysm?
What does that mean?

00:13.900 --> 00:15.400
You want us to treat
it like an aneurysm?

00:15.400 --> 00:16.900
Where's the attending?

00:16.900 --> 00:18.500
We paged him. He hasn't answered yet.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.400
You're the resident, so you're
in charge till he gets here.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.900
Right. Okay, we need to insert
an intraventricular catheter.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.700
But that will take hours.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.200
Okay, forget that.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.600
Let's just hit it
with the defibrillator.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.600
Get the paddles fired up.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.600
Charging to 300.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.200
It's charged.

00:35.900 --> 00:38.000
Clear. Clear.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.800
Okay, new plan.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.500
We need to do an intracranial bypass.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.200
We'll just insert another
catheter through the groin.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.200
Are you sure? Her brain's
not getting any oxygen.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.400
By the time we find the
aneurysm, she'll be a vegetable.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.700
I think we got to call it.

01:00.700 --> 01:01.500
Yeah.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.900
I'm gonna call it.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.599
Time of death...

01:06.100 --> 01:07.600
5:14 a.m.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.500
Time of death?

01:08.500 --> 01:09.900
What are you talking
about, time of death.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.200
Continue CPR please.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.100
She had an aneurysm I'm afraid.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.000
She's been comatose for several weeks.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.700
I thought about an intracranial drain.

01:16.700 --> 01:17.800
That's a waste of time.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.700
This patient's not having an aneurysm,

01:19.700 --> 01:20.900
she's in anaphylaxis.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.100
I don't think so.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.200
There's nothing on her chart

01:23.200 --> 01:25.300
that says anything about any allergies.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.700
No known allergies.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.700
But we changed her
antiviral this afternoon.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.500
It's got Methisone in it.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.500
We've got something.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.200
Pulse? Thirty-four.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.500
Sixty-six.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.400
BP's climbing as well.
She's stabilizing.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.000
The clues are all on the chart.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.200
You just gotta learn how to read it.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.400
You just saved that woman's life.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.000
I suppose I did.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.500
Guess it wasn't your time to go...

01:59.800 --> 02:01.200
Allison Dubois.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.700
How come you never
told me? I don't know.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.500
But in light of everything
that's happened since,

02:55.500 --> 02:57.700
it seemed kind of beside the point.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.600
Almost dying?

02:58.600 --> 03:00.500
How can that ever be beside the point?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.100
I don't know, I wasn't there.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.200
From what the doctors told me,

03:03.200 --> 03:05.000
the whole thing lasted
maybe two minutes.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.400
I mean, they called
me, I rushed down there.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.100
By the time I got down there,
you were completely stable.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.300
I never even met the
doctor who worked on you.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.200
Still...

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
But, Allie, you were in a coma.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.300
You were in a coma when
I left you that night.

03:15.300 --> 03:18.100
You were still in a coma when
I came back the next morning.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.000
It didn't seem like
that much had changed.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.200
But I'm sorry.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.700
You don't have to apologize.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.300
It's not your fault.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.900
I just-- the whole reason
I'm dreaming this dream

03:27.900 --> 03:31.200
is I'm anxious about
going back to the hospital.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.700
I'm anxious about seeing Rosemary.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.800
What are you anxious about?

03:34.800 --> 03:35.600
She's your friend.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.100
Why are you assuming the worst?

03:37.100 --> 03:39.900
Honey, it's a hospital.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.900
They don't keep you in
there 'cause they like you.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.900
Aren't you forgetting something?

03:47.900 --> 03:50.200
And then this guy Jordy, after all that,

03:50.200 --> 03:51.900
tells her he doesn't even like girls.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.400
He likes boys.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.500
Bridgette, why are
you watching that show?

03:55.500 --> 03:56.900
Mom and Dad would hate it

03:56.900 --> 03:58.600
if they knew that you
were watching that show.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.400
Nuh-uh.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.200
You're wrong.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.800
It's not even a show. It's all real.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.500
It's reality television.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.300
Okay, you know what, you don't
know what you're talking about.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.200
There is nothing real about that show.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.400
It's staged.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.300
The people who make it
tell them what to do.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.200
Nuh-uh. It's real.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.100
It's fake.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.000
You're wrong. It has to be real.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I watched it on the computer at school.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.200
What did you watch on
the computer at school?

04:20.200 --> 04:22.200
<i>She's watching that show,
The Real Life Diaries.</i>

04:22.200 --> 04:23.800
The one where the follow real people

04:23.800 --> 04:24.800
with the real problems,

04:24.800 --> 04:28.700
finding real solutions
to life's real challenges.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.100
No, no, no, Bridge.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.300
I don't want you watching that.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.400
That's not for you.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.600
Why is it not for me?

04:33.600 --> 04:35.800
I'm a person--
I'm real.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.500
Yes, but there's nothing
real about that show.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.500
She's right.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.500
It's all so lurid and adult.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.400
I want to be an adult.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.800
And I don't know what it means,

04:45.800 --> 04:47.000
but by the sound of it,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.700
I think I want to be lurid, too.

04:48.700 --> 04:49.800
Yeah, me, too.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.800
What you want to be
is on time for school.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
And I want to be on time
for my job interview.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.500
So if you guys are done
with your breakfast,

04:56.500 --> 04:59.600
how about you go into your room
and get ready for school, okay?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.500
Okay, Daddy. Thank you.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.800
Okay, Daddy.

05:03.100 --> 05:06.600
Oh, hey... when you see your mom,

05:06.600 --> 05:08.000
be sure to make a big deal.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.900
She's walking without a cane.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.100
Yeah.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.800
We're decent.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.400
I'm calling no fair.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.300
Look at you.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.300
Thank you.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.400
What's with the hair?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.600
I thought we had a deal.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.600
I just got rid of mine to support you.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.100
If I had known you were
going to grow yours back,

05:46.100 --> 05:49.700
I would have stopped taking
that chemo a long time ago.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.500
I feel like such a fool.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.700
I got out my best
babushka for your visit.

05:55.500 --> 05:59.000
And seriously, you're not
using your cane at all anymore?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.300
No, not as of this morning.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.100
You're just...

06:04.200 --> 06:07.000
a disappointment on so many levels.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.400
After all I've done for you.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.000
Don't make fun. Don't belittle.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.200
No.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.500
No, might not be important to you,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.300
but it's important to me.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.500
You're the one who got me through

06:17.500 --> 06:20.000
those first few weeks, you smart-ass.

06:21.300 --> 06:24.400
You're the one who would
come up to me and say,

06:24.400 --> 06:26.300
"get your ass out of bed."

06:27.400 --> 06:28.600
Okay.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.700
So...

06:30.800 --> 06:32.700
return the favor.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.100
Get your ass out of bed.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.700
Well, I guess you just don't
know how to say it right, do you?

06:51.200 --> 06:53.100
Rosemary, what the hell is going on?

06:53.100 --> 06:54.700
Why are you still here?

06:54.700 --> 06:55.700
Yesterday afternoon,

06:55.700 --> 06:58.300
my doctor told me I'm stage four.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.600
Can't operate again.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.600
It's too big.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.700
It's too impacted.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.500
I'm so sorry.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.700
That's what he told me.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.600
Do you know what I did?

07:16.100 --> 07:18.100
I didn't call my family.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.000
I didn't call my minister.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.700
The first person I called was you.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.100
Yesterday afternoon.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.400
You.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.800
And here you are.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.700
Here I am.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.100
So how you sleeping?

07:37.700 --> 07:38.800
You're walking.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.800
You've got hair to comb.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.500
I'm thinking you're dreaming again.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.400
So dream a dream for me.

07:50.300 --> 07:54.200
Dream me something I can
tell my husband; my kids.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.000
Would you do that?

07:57.700 --> 08:00.900
A happy dream? A hopeful dream?

08:02.400 --> 08:03.400
I'll try.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.000
I swear to God, I will try.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.500
But it kind of does what it wants to do.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.000
That's okay.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.200
If you come up empty,

08:12.200 --> 08:15.000
feel free to come back
tomorrow and lie to me.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.700
I'll be right there.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.700
Excuse me? Uh...

08:49.700 --> 08:51.200
it's Doctor...

08:51.200 --> 08:53.000
Dr. Statler?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.900
Yeah. I'm sorry. Have we met?

08:54.900 --> 08:55.800
Uh, kind of.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.000
My name's Allison Dubois.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.400
I was a patient here.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
Uh, I was in a coma
for about three months.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.600
And I, I had a bad reaction
to a drug one night.

09:04.300 --> 09:07.500
I guess, clinically, I
was dead for a few minutes.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.800
Yeah, I-I remember.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.900
I think I gave you an epi shot.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.000
Well, any other doctor would
have done the same thing.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.800
Well, I'm not so sure.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.400
And, anyway, it wasn't any other doctor.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.500
It was you.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.800
I promise you:

09:24.800 --> 09:27.500
I only get less impressive
the more you look at me.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.500
Look, I know you're a very busy man.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.400
If there's anything,
ever, that you need--

09:34.400 --> 09:36.500
not that I know what that would be...

09:37.500 --> 09:39.300
You wouldn't have a nickel, would you?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.100
Yes.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.500
Here you go.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.700
We'll call it even, huh?

10:02.100 --> 10:03.800
Sorry about that.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.300
Job interviews.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.200
I... I get pretty nervous.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.300
Would-Would you give me that?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.000
Thank you.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.100
I just-- I just dried
them off and look at them.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.000
They're already soaking wet with sweat.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
You know what you should do?

10:18.000 --> 10:18.800
You should get a bottle of water.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.100
And just keep your
hands wrapped around it

10:20.100 --> 10:21.300
till before you go in the interview.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.300
And that way your hand will be, uh, cool

10:23.300 --> 10:25.400
instead of clammy. Oh, thanks.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.800
I speak from experience.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, I'm, uh, Will... Willem Wittmar.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.400
Joe Dubois.

10:30.800 --> 10:31.800
That--
you're right.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.300
That hand is cool.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.200
Willem, huh?

10:34.200 --> 10:35.900
Like, uh, like the actor?

10:35.900 --> 10:36.800
Yeah.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.500
I, uh, really should
change it to "William."

10:38.500 --> 10:40.600
'Cause, uh, nobody ever gets it right.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.300
Here you go, Willem.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.100
I think you could probably use that.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.600
Hey, Dad.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.400
Hi, kiddo.

10:53.300 --> 10:56.000
Hey, do you know anybody in Hollywood?

10:56.500 --> 10:59.300
Hollywood? Like in the
entertainment business?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.000
No. Why?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.800
I have this really cool
idea for that TV show

11:03.800 --> 11:05.500
<i>The Real Life Diaries.</i>

11:05.600 --> 11:06.700
And I was thinking

11:06.700 --> 11:09.700
if I wrote it down, maybe
you could send it to them

11:09.700 --> 11:12.100
or write to them or e-mail to them

11:12.100 --> 11:13.700
or something.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.300
It's about this new
character, a guy named Willem.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.700
Willem?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.700
What's so funny?

11:24.700 --> 11:27.900
Bridgette. She's, uh,
she wrote some ideas

11:27.900 --> 11:29.400
for this TV show she likes.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.300
Well, why's that?

11:31.300 --> 11:32.600
I don't know.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.900
She-she wants me to
send it to the producers.

11:34.900 --> 11:37.700
Ooh, I like it. Shows initiative.

11:37.700 --> 11:38.900
Yeah.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.700
She's created all these characters.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.300
She's got this guy named Willem

11:43.300 --> 11:45.300
who, he's an astronaut,

11:45.300 --> 11:48.200
and he hasn't been
in space in, in, like,

11:48.200 --> 11:50.700
a couple years, so he's
running out of money.

11:50.700 --> 11:54.700
And his wife Tess is,
uh, she's upset with him,

11:54.700 --> 11:56.300
so she socks him in the eye.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.600
Whoa. Wonder where she got that from.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.000
I know. You haven't socked me

12:00.000 --> 12:01.600
in the eye for months.

12:09.100 --> 12:12.100
Oh, hey, you never said anything about,

12:12.100 --> 12:14.400
um, about Rosemary.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.400
What's there to say?

12:17.700 --> 12:21.300
I was right. She doesn't have much time.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.700
I'm sorry.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.500
The whole thing's so random.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.400
My tumor's benign, hers was malignant.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.100
I gonna live and...

12:34.100 --> 12:35.800
she's gonna die.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.200
Help me!

13:05.400 --> 13:08.500
Oh, my God, Rosemary, I
was so worried about you.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.400
I tried to call your
room, and nobody answered.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.700
The
nurse--

13:11.700 --> 13:14.900
she told me she would make
me feel better, feel good.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.100
She told me to relax.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.600
She said she did this
kind of thing all the time.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.100
She knew what she was doing.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.100
What do you mean? Why are you so upset?

13:22.100 --> 13:23.400
Ma'am, can I help you?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.200
No, I'm fine. We're fine.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.000
I'm just visiting my friend.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.100
Your friend?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.700
Rosemary. Rosemary Widdick.

13:32.000 --> 13:32.800
I don't understand.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.100
Didn't they tell you?

13:34.100 --> 13:36.800
Ms. Widdick passed
away early this morning.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I don't understand exactly what it is

13:48.000 --> 13:49.400
you want me to do, Allison.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
I don't know--
investigate; file charges.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.600
Help me find and arrest this
nurse that I saw in my dream.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.700
But the death certificate
clearly indicates

13:56.700 --> 13:58.900
that your friend died
from natural causes:

13:58.900 --> 14:00.600
"Sudden respiratory failure."

14:00.600 --> 14:03.000
I have to believe that
if some nurse did give

14:03.000 --> 14:04.100
your friend a drug that killed her,

14:04.100 --> 14:05.800
there would be evidence to that effect

14:05.800 --> 14:08.600
and that it would be
apparent to either her doctor

14:08.600 --> 14:09.800
or the people at the hospital...

14:09.800 --> 14:12.500
Well, not necessarily; not
if they're not looking for it.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.700
Can't you just order an autopsy?

14:15.600 --> 14:17.400
Based on what?

14:17.400 --> 14:19.600
Look... I'm sorry you lost your friend,

14:19.600 --> 14:22.500
but she was battling stage-four cancer.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.000
That's not what killed her.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.800
Even if you're right about that,

14:25.800 --> 14:27.400
my hands are tied.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.900
No crime has been reported.

14:28.900 --> 14:33.100
Even the family of the alleged
victim isn't complaining.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.100
The hospital has ruled
on the cause of death.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.000
<i>If you want someone to
revisit that judgment,</i>

14:39.900 --> 14:42.000
you're going to have to
convince someone there.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.500
Dr. Statler?

14:45.100 --> 14:46.200
Hello again.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.400
Allison
Dubois. We--

14:47.400 --> 14:48.500
I saved your life.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.000
You gave me a nickel for it.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.900
I'm sorry. I'm really busy.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.700
Is there something I can do for you?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.500
There's nothing out of
the ordinary in this chart.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.000
Well, of course not.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.400
The drug responsible for ending
my friend's life wouldn't have

15:04.400 --> 15:06.500
been recorded on that chart.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.100
That's why I need you
to authorize an autopsy.

15:10.100 --> 15:14.300
Look, I think that
Rosemary met with foul play.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.700
That's, uh, that's quite

15:17.700 --> 15:19.600
an outrageous accusation, Mrs. Dubois.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.900
Do you have any basis for it?

15:20.900 --> 15:22.100
No.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.900
I'm just taking Rosemary's word for it.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.100
Look...

15:27.200 --> 15:29.400
I know you're very busy

15:29.800 --> 15:32.400
and I know you're very
good at what you do,

15:33.400 --> 15:37.900
but it just so happens I'm
pretty good at what I do, too.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.100
Look me up.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.600
Here's my card.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.600
Call me.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.000
Tell me you'll do it.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.000
Hey, Joe.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.700
Looks like we both made it to round two.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.100
Must have been that water bottle trick.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.200
How's the other guy look?

16:00.200 --> 16:03.400
Oh, this? No, there was no other guy.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.200
I woke up in the middle of the night

16:05.200 --> 16:06.800
and you know, I tripped over my dog

16:06.800 --> 16:09.500
and I went smack into
the the bathroom door.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.600
My wife actually, she
tried to convince me

16:11.600 --> 16:13.300
to use some of makeup
to cover it up, but...

16:13.300 --> 16:17.000
Your wife... Tess?

16:17.700 --> 16:20.600
Yeah. Did-did I mention
her the other day?

16:21.200 --> 16:24.000
Yeah, Tess, she, uh, she tried

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
to get me to use something
called "concealer."

16:26.000 --> 16:27.300
I mean, have you heard of this stuff?

16:27.300 --> 16:29.600
It's, it's... What's
that say about women

16:29.600 --> 16:32.700
that they carry around
this stuff called concealer?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.300
Go away!

16:37.300 --> 16:38.600
Hey.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.800
Oh. Sorry, I thought you were Marie.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.900
Ah, that's okay .

16:44.900 --> 16:47.800
Um, what you, uh, what you doing?

16:47.800 --> 16:50.100
You working on some
ideas for the TV show?

16:50.100 --> 16:52.000
Well, I had a dream
about them last night,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.600
and I've been waiting all
day to write them down.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.600
Are you mad?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.500
No, I'm not mad. (splutters)

16:58.800 --> 17:00.700
So what's going on?

17:00.700 --> 17:04.099
What's in store for ol' Willem, hmm?

17:04.099 --> 17:06.700
Are things gonna start
looking up for the guy?

17:06.700 --> 17:09.500
Is he gonna get some work?

17:10.800 --> 17:12.000
Wait. I don't understand.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.599
So your competition for this job is some

17:15.300 --> 17:17.300
down-on-his-luck
astronaut

17:17.300 --> 17:21.400
who has a ex-countess for a wife?

17:22.099 --> 17:25.200
Well, Bridgette did take
some creative liberties,

17:25.200 --> 17:27.599
but she also got a lot of things right.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.600
<i>This guy Willem is out of work.</i>

17:29.600 --> 17:32.400
<i>He is married to a woman named Tess.</i>

17:32.900 --> 17:35.900
And, as far as I can tell,
she did sock him in the eye.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.600
"Tess wanted money.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.300
"It was all she ever really cared about.

17:40.300 --> 17:43.000
"And when Willem
couldn't give her enough,

17:43.000 --> 17:44.600
"she found herself another man.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.500
His name was Carlo."

17:47.600 --> 17:50.700
What? So are we supposed to
believe that this lady is cheating

17:50.700 --> 17:52.600
on her husband 'cause
he can't find a job?

17:52.600 --> 17:54.900
I mean, nobody can find a job.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.200
Hello?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.400
I looked you up, Mrs. Dubois.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.400
Apparently you are usually
pretty good at what you do.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.800
So I called the Widdick family;
I was able to convince them

18:10.800 --> 18:12.900
to let us perform an
autopsy on Rosemary.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.700
I'm looking at the results right now.

18:14.700 --> 18:15.900
That's terrific.

18:15.900 --> 18:18.000
Yeah, well, you tell me.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.800
We found no unusual
substances in her system,

18:20.800 --> 18:22.700
just the medication we prescribed.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.300
We did find that her cancer
had spread even further

18:25.300 --> 18:28.000
than her primary oncologist suspected.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.300
Her kidneys were pretty much gone.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.800
Her heart valves were not clear

18:31.800 --> 18:34.100
and her lymphatic
system was compromised.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.600
Mrs. Dubois, I-I don't
know what to tell you,

18:37.600 --> 18:41.400
but this woman died because her
body was consumed with cancer,

18:41.400 --> 18:44.000
not because someone gave
her a drug that killed her.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.600
I'm just surprised.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.300
Mrs. Dubois, I'm sorry
you lost your friend.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.500
Perhaps knowing that she
died of natural causes

18:53.500 --> 18:55.700
will make it easier to accept.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.500
Thank you.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.700
Help me!

19:17.900 --> 19:19.700
It hurts!

19:25.700 --> 19:27.100
Pain!

19:27.800 --> 19:30.400
Don't worry... I've
already given you something

19:30.400 --> 19:32.600
that's gonna make all of that go away.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.100
Dr. Bench prescribed something new.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.800
It's very powerful stuff.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.600
Trust me.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.100
Try and relax.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.900
You're not the first patient
I've administered this to.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.600
That's it. Get some sleep.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.200
It's all right, dear.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.300
It's your time.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.000
What's so riveting, hmm?

20:27.700 --> 20:30.700
Ooh, isn't that handsome Dr. Statler,

20:30.700 --> 20:33.000
the man who saved your life?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.700
He did. He saved my life, didn't he?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.900
Mm-hmm, yes, he did.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.100
Why?

20:41.100 --> 20:43.000
I've been up here 4:00 in the morning,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.800
trying to read everything
I can about him,

20:44.800 --> 20:46.700
trying to convince myself.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.600
Is there something you want to tell me?

20:52.200 --> 20:54.300
I think he killed Rosemary.

20:54.900 --> 20:57.100
I think he did it on purpose.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.100
Wait a second.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.600
Didn't you say a nurse did it?

21:00.600 --> 21:02.500
You said that you saw a nurse doing it.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.900
I said Rosemary saw a nurse do it.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.700
I think she-she thought she did.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.600
But as it turns out,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
the nurse was just
giving her a painkiller.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.400
Statler slipped in there later
and killed her in her sleep.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.500
At least that's what I dreamt.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.400
Well, why don't we talk
about that for a second?

21:18.400 --> 21:20.700
You just started dreaming again,

21:20.700 --> 21:22.800
after being in a coma for months,

21:22.800 --> 21:25.300
after weeks of having no dreams at all.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.700
Is it possible that...

21:27.700 --> 21:30.200
what you saw didn't happen?

21:30.900 --> 21:32.500
I... That's what I'm hoping.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.500
I would love to be wrong.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.400
Anyway, you
know what, this--

21:37.400 --> 21:39.200
I think you got some
e-mail or something.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.700
This mail symbol keeps flashing.

21:50.300 --> 21:54.000
Hey, uh, I hate to
shatter a horrible mood

21:54.000 --> 21:56.500
with good news, but it's Drew.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.400
He said the interview went great.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.900
They love me.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.200
They're putting together an offer.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.600
I might have a job.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.410
Michael Crawford,340...

22:07.960 --> 22:09.200
Mr. Carlisle.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.910
Sorry to shanghai you after your lunch.

22:12.530 --> 22:13.710
Um,my name's Allison Dubois.

22:13.770 --> 22:15.510
I'm with the district attorney's office.

22:15.530 --> 22:16.980
I was also a patient here.

22:17.030 --> 22:19.570
I was hoping maybe I could
have a few minutes of your time.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.210
<i>That's quite a story.</i>

22:21.270 --> 22:22.470
I want you to understand that

22:22.800 --> 22:24.180
I admire Dr. Statler.

22:24.730 --> 22:27.700
I-- Dr. Statler
saved my life.

22:28.290 --> 22:29.670
But I've been doing research

22:29.730 --> 22:31.340
on his career
this morning and--

22:32.100 --> 22:32.970
Are you aware

22:33.050 --> 22:35.230
that before Dr. Statler
came to work here,

22:35.280 --> 22:37.290
you never had more
than nine deaths a year

22:37.340 --> 22:39.030
from sudden respiratory failure?

22:40.470 --> 22:42.400
Sudden respiratory failure.

22:43.650 --> 22:44.810
It's what's listed here

22:44.890 --> 22:47.270
on my friend Rosemary's
death certificate.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.940
It's kind of a catchall phrase,right?

22:52.690 --> 22:54.920
Basically means "We really
don't know what happened here."

22:54.990 --> 22:57.680
Medicine is still as much
an art as it is a science.

22:57.730 --> 22:59.320
And yes,sometimes it can be difficult

22:59.790 --> 23:02.220
to pinpoint a precise cause of death.

23:03.010 --> 23:04.400
But that doesn't mean
there's any question about

23:04.460 --> 23:06.510
whether the cause was natural or not.

23:06.580 --> 23:09.000
I'm sorry,Mrs. Dubois, your point?

23:09.070 --> 23:11.580
My point is,after Dr.
Statler came to work for you,

23:12.580 --> 23:14.210
the number of deaths
you had attributed to

23:14.270 --> 23:17.550
sudden respiratory failure
went from nine a year to 20.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.210
That's just in his first year.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.320
Twenty--
20 deaths.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.680
And almost all of them
in the oncology ward.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.710
And the year after that, there were 25.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.530
That's almost three times
the national average.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.000
And-and after that...

23:30.050 --> 23:31.460
What are we doing here?

23:32.640 --> 23:33.870
Who am I talking to?

23:33.900 --> 23:36.130
Am I talking to someone from
the district attorney's office

23:36.170 --> 23:37.190
or a grieving friend?

23:37.240 --> 23:38.740
What does it matter? I'm asking

23:38.810 --> 23:40.750
if you are here in an official capacity

23:40.820 --> 23:42.270
or a personal one.

23:42.330 --> 23:44.230
Does the district attorney
even know you're here?

23:44.290 --> 23:45.660
What difference does it make?!

23:45.680 --> 23:47.220
Something is wrong!

23:47.280 --> 23:49.760
You need to begin an
internal investigation.

23:49.800 --> 23:50.800
Statler needs to know

23:50.850 --> 23:51.930
that he's being watched.

23:51.990 --> 23:52.960
I see.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.690
Based on a morning of
looking at newspaper clippings

23:55.720 --> 23:57.590
and combing through Internet gossip,

23:57.650 --> 23:58.750
you've decided to come over here

23:58.790 --> 24:00.240
and tell me how to run my hospital.

24:00.300 --> 24:00.890
Mr. Carlisle...

24:00.940 --> 24:02.570
Mrs. Dubois,I am certain

24:02.630 --> 24:04.290
that in all that research you did,

24:04.330 --> 24:06.480
you must have ascertained
that Thomas Statler--

24:06.530 --> 24:08.000
the man who
saved your life--

24:08.540 --> 24:11.180
is one of the most respected
oncologists in this country.

24:11.230 --> 24:13.070
This is a man who has dedicated himself

24:13.130 --> 24:15.600
to treating people others
have deemed untreatable.

24:16.150 --> 24:19.950
Patients of means,people who
could afford to go anywhere,

24:20.010 --> 24:22.550
come to this hospital because he's here.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.380
Because of his reputation,
because of his expertise.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.770
He killed my friend.

24:27.820 --> 24:28.610
I won't listen to this.

24:28.650 --> 24:30.290
He killed a lot of other people.

24:30.340 --> 24:31.910
I will thank you to leave my office.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.500
I think you'd

24:33.550 --> 24:35.970
feel differently if somebody
you loved was in his care.

24:38.830 --> 24:41.320
It might interest you to know
that when my wife was diagnosed

24:41.370 --> 24:43.740
with Hodgkin's two years ago,
the only person I would allow

24:43.790 --> 24:45.850
to treat her was Dr. Thomas Statler.

24:46.410 --> 24:49.190
He kept her alive and
comfortable for months,

24:49.650 --> 24:52.190
longer than other doctors
even suggested she'd survive.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.390
So I hope you believe me when I tell you

24:56.430 --> 24:59.840
that if you do not cease and
desist with this slandering

24:59.880 --> 25:01.870
of his good name and the
good name of this hospital,

25:01.890 --> 25:03.290
I will marshal all the resources

25:03.350 --> 25:05.100
of this institution
and take you to court

25:05.160 --> 25:07.190
and make sure that yu and your dreams...

25:08.410 --> 25:09.920
never defame anyone again.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.250
Hello.

25:16.820 --> 25:17.820
Oh,hey,Drew.

25:19.200 --> 25:19.980
Yeah.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.790
What do you mean they went another way?

25:24.860 --> 25:26.760
Your e-mail said that they loved me.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.860
Your e-mail said they were,
they were gonna make an offer.

25:30.090 --> 25:30.510
Hey,Dad.

25:31.460 --> 25:32.210
Hi,Dad.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.230
Okay.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.520
Hi,Dad. Hi,Dad.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.160
All right,okay. No,no,no,I'm not...

25:36.210 --> 25:37.450
Hi,Dad. Hi,hi,hi,hi,sweetie.

25:37.490 --> 25:38.190
Come on.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.820
Sorry,my kids. Yeah.

25:39.890 --> 25:41.340
No,I'm not thrown.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.240
I know it's-it's just a numbers game.

25:43.950 --> 25:45.770
Yeah,the trick is to get on out there.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.680
Is everything okay?

25:49.430 --> 25:50.450
Yeah,everything's fine.

25:50.490 --> 25:52.630
I just didn't get that,
uh,job that I was after.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.390
That's so weird.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.870
Willem got his.

25:56.610 --> 25:58.000
What do you mean "Willem got his"?

25:58.060 --> 25:59.860
Well,I had a dream last night.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.380
Willem was getting

26:01.440 --> 26:05.000
really close to this big job
at NASA,but he was up against

26:05.070 --> 26:07.440
this other astronaut, this guy Joey.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.160
And the other
astronaut--

26:08.200 --> 26:09.130
Joey?

26:09.640 --> 26:10.580
Are you serious?

26:10.660 --> 26:12.040
What? That's his name.

26:12.550 --> 26:14.600
The other astronaut was
supposed to get the job,

26:15.100 --> 26:18.080
but Willem knew that his wife
Tess wasn't gonna like that.

26:18.150 --> 26:20.740
So he called his friend Carlo.

26:20.810 --> 26:21.750
Carlo's... Wait,stop.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.590
I thought Carlo was the
guy who was going over to

26:24.500 --> 26:26.430
see Tess when Willem wasn't home.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.360
He is,but Willem doesn't know that.

26:29.430 --> 26:31.420
He and Carlo have been friends forever.

26:31.510 --> 26:33.890
So,Carlo's an astronaut,too.

26:33.970 --> 26:37.690
And Willem asked Carlo to call
NASA and tell the people there

26:38.070 --> 26:41.010
that Joey is a really bad astronaut.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.450
Son of a...

26:51.700 --> 26:53.740
What in God's name gives
you the right to judge me?

26:53.810 --> 26:55.810
Dr. Statler. How dare you suggest

26:55.850 --> 26:57.340
to the man who runs my hospital

26:57.400 --> 26:59.670
that I would do anything
but deliver the finest,

26:59.720 --> 27:01.430
most humane care to my patients.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.330
Dr. Statler,can we talk
about this in private?

27:05.950 --> 27:06.850
Where are you going?

27:07.380 --> 27:08.650
I'm still talking to you!

27:12.450 --> 27:13.800
Don't you dare walk away from me

27:13.850 --> 27:15.480
while I'm speaking to you or I...

27:15.530 --> 27:16.760
Or you'll what?

27:16.790 --> 27:18.120
You'll decide to put me down?

27:18.190 --> 27:19.820
That's what you do, isn't it?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.680
You decide who gets to live or die,

27:21.730 --> 27:24.480
you decide who gets
care and who doesn't.

27:24.690 --> 27:26.540
You know,there's another word for that.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.010
It's "murder."

27:28.820 --> 27:30.880
I think you murdered my friend.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.620
I think you murdered
a lot of other people.

27:33.030 --> 27:33.850
Really?

27:34.500 --> 27:35.500
Is that how you call it?

27:35.570 --> 27:37.020
Is that what you think of it?

27:37.710 --> 27:39.450
Well,then,you've never been sick.

27:40.260 --> 27:41.580
Not really sick.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.810
Lying in bed watching while
your fortune disappears

27:44.880 --> 27:45.880
and your family withers

27:45.950 --> 27:47.700
because there's no one
there with the intelligence

27:47.760 --> 27:49.550
or the courage to make
the difficult decisions

27:49.600 --> 27:51.430
that need to be made
in such a circumstance;

27:52.050 --> 27:53.780
decisions that we've consigned to

27:54.210 --> 27:56.270
insurance companies and hospital boards

27:56.310 --> 27:59.070
and other anonymous groups who
never need to look the patient

27:59.130 --> 28:00.610
or their loved ones in the eye

28:00.650 --> 28:02.600
and explain why they
would prolong suffering

28:02.650 --> 28:04.220
when there's no hope of recovery.

28:04.810 --> 28:07.320
You judge me because I'm willing
to do things that others won't?

28:07.390 --> 28:09.270
Because I'm willing to entertain mercy.

28:10.050 --> 28:11.130
Not murder.

28:12.000 --> 28:12.900
Mercy.

28:12.940 --> 28:16.330
There was nothing merciful
about what you did to my friend.

28:16.370 --> 28:17.780
Your friend was already dead.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.290
All that was left for her is to sit

28:20.350 --> 28:22.950
and watch her body decay
while her brain atrophied.

28:22.990 --> 28:24.640
She wasn't ready to die.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.750
That was her decision
to make, not yours.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.220
Sorry. I beg to differ.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.460
She wasn't qualified
to make that decision.

28:30.470 --> 28:32.610
She lacked the intelligence
and the experience.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.360
Unlike you. Unlike me.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.570
The fact that you get sick does not mean

28:37.640 --> 28:40.080
you have a full understanding
of what sickness really is.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.240
The sad truth of it is,

28:43.280 --> 28:45.340
is that nowadays, if
you have enough money,

28:45.400 --> 28:47.650
you can keep almost anyone alive.

28:48.300 --> 28:50.140
But the question is,can they live?

28:55.980 --> 28:57.290
I asked myself that question

28:57.370 --> 28:58.750
that night I walked into your room.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.950
I considered your age,

29:02.480 --> 29:04.330
your health up until that point,

29:04.390 --> 29:05.880
the amount of time
you'd been flatlining,

29:05.950 --> 29:07.250
and I saved your life.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.670
Hope you're not going to
make me regret that decision.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.250
<i>You know,I don't begrudge
you  your outrage,</i>

29:20.290 --> 29:21.050
but...

29:22.030 --> 29:23.600
just to keep things in perspective,

29:23.650 --> 29:24.820
it's not like he's killing anybody

29:24.880 --> 29:26.530
who isn't already at death's door.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.690
Are you actually defending him?

29:28.770 --> 29:31.060
No,no,no, absolutely not.

29:31.110 --> 29:33.120
This guy-- he's
clearly a sociopath.

29:33.170 --> 29:34.730
I'm just trying to
help you accept the fact

29:34.800 --> 29:37.370
that maybe there's nothing
else that you can do.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.290
I mean,you told me

29:39.590 --> 29:41.690
that this guy somehow manages

29:41.750 --> 29:43.600
to do what he does without
leaving any evidence.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.050
And the hospital clearly
isn't interested in,

29:46.110 --> 29:47.460
you know,looking any harder into this.

29:47.510 --> 29:48.360
I
mean,Statler--

29:48.420 --> 29:52.540
he treated the-the chief
administrator's wife,right?

29:54.710 --> 29:56.250
So I'm supposed to do nothing?

29:56.640 --> 29:57.610
No,I'm not saying that.

29:57.710 --> 29:58.850
I'm saying you've already done it.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.200
You know? Maybe you gave
him a good scare today.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.920
Maybe that'll make him think twice

30:02.980 --> 30:04.400
before he's tempted to,you know,

30:04.880 --> 30:06.080
be merciful again.

30:06.150 --> 30:07.920
I don't know. He didn't
look scared to me.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.560
I don't think he's the kind of
guy who has scared on his menu.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.320
<i>President George W. Bush</i>

30:13.380 --> 30:15.910
is set to give his State of
the Union address this evening,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.950
with insiders speculating
that he'll announce an increase

30:19.030 --> 30:21.080
in troop levels in Afghanistan.

30:21.160 --> 30:24.969
This on the heels of several
I.E.D. roadside bombs...

30:24.970 --> 30:25.340
You wanted

30:25.380 --> 30:26.260
to see me,Jerry?

30:26.670 --> 30:27.350
Yeah.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.520
Come on in. Close the door,please.

30:34.810 --> 30:36.550
Jeanette Gratz over in ICU

30:36.600 --> 30:37.880
sent me an e-mail today.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.410
It was about you.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.860
It seems that some of her nurses
noticed an unusually high number

30:43.930 --> 30:46.200
of patients succumbing to
sudden respiratory failure.

30:46.250 --> 30:49.310
Your patients,or patients
you had access to.

30:51.820 --> 30:53.360
What,you're waiting for me

30:53.430 --> 30:56.140
to dignify this malicious
gossip with a response?

30:56.240 --> 30:58.000
I'm not waiting for anything.

30:58.610 --> 31:02.690
I'm obligated,legally, to
investigate any complaint

31:02.780 --> 31:04.190
that calls into question the death

31:04.260 --> 31:05.620
of anyone under our care.

31:05.660 --> 31:07.190
Part of that obligation...

31:08.480 --> 31:10.200
is to suspend your privileges

31:10.280 --> 31:11.090
while we get to the bottom of this.

31:11.140 --> 31:12.380
You're suspending me?

31:12.940 --> 31:13.970
I'm the head of Oncology.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.210
How can you suspend me?

31:15.270 --> 31:16.620
It's already done.

31:17.740 --> 31:18.640
As of tomorrow morning,

31:18.710 --> 31:20.020
your surgeries are cancelled,

31:20.080 --> 31:21.700
your recuperating
patients have been assigned

31:21.740 --> 31:23.100
to other doctors in the unit.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.350
If the investigation turns up nothing,

31:25.400 --> 31:27.260
you'll be immediately reinstated...

31:27.750 --> 31:29.620
if you choose to stay.

31:46.770 --> 31:48.850
How much debt are you in,Jerry?

31:51.100 --> 31:53.580
Don't make a bad situation worse,Tom.

31:53.680 --> 31:56.310
How much does a man
in your position make?

31:56.400 --> 31:58.470
Do you pull down a tenth of what I do?

31:58.510 --> 31:59.660
A twentieth?

31:59.680 --> 32:01.210
I heard you asked Micah Reese

32:01.270 --> 32:03.530
over at Pediatrics
for a loan-- $50,000.

32:03.580 --> 32:04.420
You might want to take note

32:04.490 --> 32:05.930
of where your feet are, Dr. Statler.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.650
The ice is getting awfully thin.

32:07.730 --> 32:09.800
I was just thinking what a shame it was

32:09.870 --> 32:12.470
that,uh,my privileges are null and void

32:12.540 --> 32:15.980
when you and your wife
need me more than ever.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.190
My wife?

32:17.260 --> 32:18.450
What are you talking about?

32:18.530 --> 32:20.630
Well,I seem to remember
that Deborah came in

32:20.640 --> 32:22.370
for treatment last year.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.790
A slight melanoma.

32:25.380 --> 32:27.560
I know this is a personal question,

32:27.610 --> 32:28.770
but I'm curious:

32:29.280 --> 32:31.580
How much life insurance
do you have on her?

32:31.650 --> 32:33.090
What are you...?! We all go

32:33.170 --> 32:34.670
to the Christmas parties, Jerry.

32:34.730 --> 32:35.900
We all know what happens

32:35.950 --> 32:37.700
when Deborah has one cocktail too many,

32:37.750 --> 32:39.960
three cocktails too many,
five cocktails too many.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.850
We all know that over the years,
she's distinguished herself

32:44.220 --> 32:46.970
with her,uh,willingness
to sleep with any physician

32:47.040 --> 32:48.230
who would pay for a hotel room.

32:48.270 --> 32:49.480
How dare you.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.480
Now,the thing about life insurance is...

32:51.540 --> 32:53.180
you have to buy it before

32:53.210 --> 32:55.210
a life-threatening
condition is discovered.

32:55.950 --> 32:59.380
Let's say,if you went out and
bought a rather large policy

32:59.440 --> 33:00.590
on your wife today,

33:01.310 --> 33:03.560
if I were to bring her
back in for further tests,

33:03.620 --> 33:06.270
if I were to find that the
melanoma hadn't recurred,

33:06.320 --> 33:08.410
but that it developed into
something more serious--

33:12.010 --> 33:13.430
that she be admitted to the hospital.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.690
And I know that is a very scary thought.

33:16.190 --> 33:20.160
Especially given the unusually
high rate of mortality

33:20.220 --> 33:21.510
among my patients.

33:23.230 --> 33:28.370
Of course,that's all moot since
I don't have any privileges.

33:36.510 --> 33:38.310
The facts are not in dispute here.

33:38.390 --> 33:40.940
We have had numerous
fatalities in the oncology ward.

33:41.530 --> 33:44.050
But it is,after all, an oncology ward.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.380
These are some of the sickest patients

33:46.460 --> 33:48.080
in the entire hospital population.

33:48.150 --> 33:51.170
The survivability rate is
the lowest of any single ward

33:51.210 --> 33:53.540
in the hospital. This is expected.

33:54.110 --> 33:55.370
And while the number of deaths

33:55.430 --> 33:57.800
from respiratory failure
are statistically improbable,

33:57.860 --> 33:59.220
they're certainly not impossible.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.670
They're certainly not unprecedented.

34:02.610 --> 34:04.640
Mr. District Attorney, I promise you,

34:04.710 --> 34:05.750
I've been through all of this

34:05.810 --> 34:07.570
since your colleague came to see me.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.620
And I am convinced what we're looking at

34:09.699 --> 34:11.580
is a statistical anomaly.

34:11.670 --> 34:13.830
Not the result of some
sort of killing spree

34:13.889 --> 34:15.780
by a sociopathic physician.

34:16.510 --> 34:18.120
I'm sorry,there just
isn't any indication

34:18.170 --> 34:19.510
that Dr. Statler's been indulging

34:19.550 --> 34:22.170
in the kind of behavior Mrs.
Dubois keeps accusing him of.

34:22.230 --> 34:24.230
I appreciate your candor, Mr. Carlisle,

34:24.270 --> 34:25.969
but I didn't ask you down here today

34:26.010 --> 34:28.659
to discuss Dr. Statler's involvement

34:28.719 --> 34:30.110
in this rash of deaths.

34:30.179 --> 34:31.179
You didn't?

34:32.360 --> 34:33.780
Then what am I doing here?

34:34.150 --> 34:35.800
To discuss your involvement.

34:35.870 --> 34:37.060
My involvement?

34:37.070 --> 34:38.040
That's right.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.159
Before her death, your wife Deborah...

34:43.800 --> 34:46.030
was being treated by
Dr. Statler,wasn't she?

34:47.230 --> 34:47.960
Yes.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.040
Where are we going with this?

34:50.110 --> 34:54.030
Well,I'd just like to know why
you referred her to Dr. Statler,

34:54.110 --> 34:56.230
even though a source tells
me that you received a number

34:56.300 --> 34:59.920
of e-mails from hospital staff
laying out their suspicions

34:59.990 --> 35:01.670
about his practices, in great detail.

35:01.740 --> 35:03.490
You're talking about hospital gossip.

35:03.550 --> 35:06.260
Dr. Statler's the best
oncologist in this state.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.570
Even though you were very
busy transferring everyone

35:08.620 --> 35:11.070
who complained about the good
doctor to other hospitals,

35:11.120 --> 35:14.740
you still found time to purchase
a few life insurance policies

35:14.790 --> 35:17.840
on your wife before she
went to go see Statler.

35:18.310 --> 35:20.090
It's almost as if you knew
that he was going to tell her

35:20.140 --> 35:21.520
that the melanoma was back.

35:22.270 --> 35:23.770
That she'd require surgery.

35:25.150 --> 35:26.860
And that she wouldn't be coming home.

35:26.940 --> 35:28.350
Do you think I murdered my wife?

35:29.800 --> 35:32.740
I hope you've got more than
nurses' chatter to back that up.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.070
That's a warrant

35:37.120 --> 35:38.540
allowing us to seize your computer.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.700
My people are quite good

35:40.170 --> 35:42.880
at finding deleted files and e-mails.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.060
Once we're able to
prove that you were aware

35:45.130 --> 35:48.590
of the hospital staff's
suspicions of his practices,

35:48.640 --> 35:51.290
and that you still put
your wife into his care,

35:51.350 --> 35:52.360
well,at that point, I'll be ready

35:52.390 --> 35:54.080
to take my chances in court.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.470
Or perhaps you would like
to take care of this today.

35:58.580 --> 36:00.710
Agree to testify against Statler.

36:00.770 --> 36:02.250
If you're willing to tell us everything

36:02.310 --> 36:03.640
about the deal the two of you struck,

36:03.700 --> 36:05.380
then I'm willing to
make a deal with you.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.260
But you should know, this
is a limited-time offer.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.380
Once we find what I think we're
going to find in that computer,

36:11.990 --> 36:14.280
then my willingness
to bargain goes away.

36:15.150 --> 36:16.190
Should take us about a day

36:16.260 --> 36:18.170
to get through those
files, Mr. Carlisle.

36:18.860 --> 36:21.850
So,please... give it some thought.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.150
Nice window.

36:30.490 --> 36:31.470
Thanks.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.740
Uh,sorry for beating
you out for the job.

36:34.330 --> 36:36.830
So,uh,wh-wh-what are
you doing down here?

36:36.890 --> 36:38.760
Well,I was just running some errands

36:38.810 --> 36:39.760
in the neighborhood.

36:39.810 --> 36:41.220
I thought I'd say congratulations.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.220
Thanks.

36:44.020 --> 36:46.680
Just one quick question before I go.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.970
Um,do you know a guy
named Carlo Carcetti?

36:50.540 --> 36:52.520
He works for my old firm, Aerodytech.

36:52.780 --> 36:53.720
Yeah,sure.

36:53.770 --> 36:56.540
Carlo and I went to graduate
school together. Why?

36:57.240 --> 36:59.750
Well,you know,it's weird.

36:59.790 --> 37:01.040
I never met the guy.

37:01.110 --> 37:04.610
He started at Aerodytech a
couple weeks before I left,

37:05.170 --> 37:07.890
but I hear that he called
this place and told them

37:07.980 --> 37:09.880
that I botched a big project.

37:10.450 --> 37:11.500
Really?

37:12.160 --> 37:13.500
That's what I hear.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.970
That-That would be a really
low thing for someone to do.

37:22.420 --> 37:25.460
You'd have to be willing to give
up every principle you ever had.

37:27.770 --> 37:29.390
I mean,you'd have to be desperate.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.590
Out of work for so long,
you almost can't remember

37:31.670 --> 37:33.320
what it's like to have a job.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.780
So broke your,uh,
marriage is falling apart.

37:38.490 --> 37:39.320
Right.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.740
Uh,look,are you going to
make a thing out of this?

37:45.790 --> 37:47.390
'Cause I'm not going to just quit.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.000
I really need this.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.510
Frankly,I need this more
than I need to be able

37:53.550 --> 37:55.300
to look at myself in the mirror.

37:55.370 --> 37:56.790
Hey,hey. Relax.

37:57.550 --> 37:59.530
I hear they're paying you squat.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.510
And I hear that this place
is going to go out of business

38:02.550 --> 38:04.310
in a year,if they don't
get bridge funding.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.990
So... it's okay. Job's yours.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.480
So,what do you want?

38:09.530 --> 38:10.870
Why did you come down here?

38:11.540 --> 38:13.900
Believe it or not,I came
here to give you a heads up.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.410
You might want to have a conversation

38:16.470 --> 38:22.080
with Carlo about his,uh,
friendship with your wife.

38:23.420 --> 38:25.750
I think that Carlo might
have his own reasons

38:25.800 --> 38:28.550
for wanting you out of
the house five days a week.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.870
What's that supposed to mean?

38:32.640 --> 38:35.220
Well,you're going to have to
figure that out by yourself,

38:35.290 --> 38:36.950
'cause I got to go look for a job.

38:42.880 --> 38:43.560
Hey!

38:43.640 --> 38:44.570
Hey.

38:44.660 --> 38:45.970
Whatcha doin'?

38:46.050 --> 38:47.580
Cleaning out the garage.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.720
I'm still officially looking for work,

38:49.760 --> 38:50.800
officially unemployed,

38:50.870 --> 38:52.560
and cleaning out the garage is

38:52.610 --> 38:53.830
what the officially unemployed do.

38:53.880 --> 38:54.920
So,I'm doing it.

38:54.990 --> 38:56.700
Oh,you're going to
get another interview.

38:56.790 --> 38:57.800
You'll get a job.

38:57.870 --> 38:58.720
I know.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.750
You know that from Bridgette?

39:00.810 --> 39:02.100
No,no,no.

39:02.180 --> 39:03.670
My headhunter called.

39:03.770 --> 39:06.440
He,uh,just wanted to reassure me

39:06.910 --> 39:08.300
that he's out hunting heads.

39:09.030 --> 39:11.360
Well,it may be the light in here,

39:11.420 --> 39:12.820
but you actually look kinda happy.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.770
I am. I am happy,Joe.

39:15.030 --> 39:16.530
The guy who runs the hospital is

39:16.550 --> 39:18.160
going to come in tomorrow
to give a statement.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.550
He's going to bring his lawyer in.

39:19.620 --> 39:21.190
So,Devalos thinks that means

39:21.250 --> 39:22.850
that he's ready to cut a deal.

39:27.330 --> 39:28.750
I hear the police came by today.

39:28.810 --> 39:29.670
Tom.

39:30.340 --> 39:31.040
I didn't know

39:31.110 --> 39:32.590
you were covering the
night shift tonight.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.970
I switched with Pinero.

39:35.030 --> 39:36.220
So,it's true.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.760
They confiscated your computer.

39:39.800 --> 39:40.660
Yeah.

39:40.730 --> 39:42.870
They were asking all kinds of questions.

39:42.930 --> 39:44.160
They've got nothing,though.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.710
Just a bunch of theories.

39:45.780 --> 39:46.860
Of course they've got nothing.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.230
There's no evidence of any crime.

39:49.340 --> 39:53.300
Frankly,the only thing that
can compromise me... is you.

39:54.210 --> 39:55.040
Relax.

39:55.110 --> 39:56.450
I didn't tell them anything.

39:56.510 --> 39:58.250
Not in my best interests, either.

40:00.140 --> 40:01.470
You know how I do it,Jerry?

40:02.020 --> 40:04.160
How I make it seem like it's God's work

40:04.750 --> 40:06.700
when one of my patients passes on?

40:07.380 --> 40:08.430
Potassium.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.160
Simple as that. Potassium.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.240
Now,potassium levels are
almost always elevated

40:14.300 --> 40:15.620
after death,anyway.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.340
And if you get the dosage right,

40:17.730 --> 40:19.280
no one will suspect foul play.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.000
They'll just assume it's some sort of...

40:21.060 --> 40:22.800
Sudden respiratory failure.

40:25.130 --> 40:26.000
But in your case, I think they'll go

40:26.070 --> 40:27.010
for heart attack.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.350
See,it presents itself differently

40:29.430 --> 40:31.210
when ingested instead of injected.

40:31.790 --> 40:33.170
Sometimes there's vomiting.

40:33.220 --> 40:34.730
Sometimes chest pains.

40:47.730 --> 40:49.610
Those are probably
the first palpitations.

40:50.430 --> 40:52.300
They're painful,but they
won't last very long.

41:20.190 --> 41:21.140
Time of death.

41:22.570 --> 41:23.580
12:14.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.010
Mrs. Dubois. What are you doing here?

41:40.060 --> 41:41.530
I know what you did to that man.

41:42.380 --> 41:43.140
Oh,maybe you do.

41:43.190 --> 41:44.070
Maybe you don't.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.090
Doesn't matter.

41:45.190 --> 41:46.190
YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING

41:46.580 --> 41:47.970
All those things that you said

41:48.030 --> 41:50.920
about mercy,
and principles--

41:50.990 --> 41:51.930
it's all a bunch of garbage.

41:51.980 --> 41:53.390
It's all a bunch of crap.

41:53.450 --> 41:55.390
You're exactly what I said you were.

41:55.470 --> 41:56.830
You're a murderer.

41:56.910 --> 41:58.900
Don't confuse the means with the end.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.570
Jerry Carlisle threatened my career.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.030
I had to make a judgment call.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.170
The life and career
of a dedicated doctor

42:07.240 --> 42:10.530
is worth more than the life and
career of cuckold bureaucrat.

42:10.580 --> 42:13.700
Now,I'm fully aware of
how arrogant that sounds.

42:15.540 --> 42:17.090
Doesn't make it any less true.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.020
You don't actually think
I'm going to allow you

42:19.050 --> 42:20.570
to continue killing people, do you?

42:21.690 --> 42:25.120
I am going to find a way
to prove what you're doing.

42:25.190 --> 42:26.410
I'm sure you'll try.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.160
But,uh,if you want to keep an eye on me,

42:28.180 --> 42:29.620
you're going have to move to Georgia.

42:31.630 --> 42:33.510
See,there's a hospital in Atlanta

42:33.560 --> 42:35.540
that's been trying
to steal me for years.

42:36.370 --> 42:39.560
I finally accepted their
latest offer this afternoon.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.740
I don't know,it just feels
like it's time to move on.

42:42.800 --> 42:43.880
Don't you think?

42:48.300 --> 42:51.590
You know,that night we
first crossed paths--

42:51.650 --> 42:53.920
that night I
treated you--

42:54.780 --> 42:57.710
I had no idea what a unique
talent I was preserving.

42:59.240 --> 43:01.070
In spite of everything that's happened,

43:01.140 --> 43:03.710
I'm glad I saved your life, Mrs. Dubois.
