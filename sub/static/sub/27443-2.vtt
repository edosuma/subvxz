WEBVTT

00:02.378 --> 00:03.780
Surprise, surprise.

00:03.977 --> 00:06.447
Jackson is in love, again.

00:06.481 --> 00:08.650
But this time, Ali's not buying it.

00:08.683 --> 00:11.719
I need you to be there
for me and not Baylee.

00:11.751 --> 00:14.556
Does that mean he has to pay
you, like up front, every month?

00:14.588 --> 00:15.417
Every month.

00:15.471 --> 00:18.026
Kerry made it clear that his
dreams were worth more than

00:18.058 --> 00:19.560
Rachyl's.

00:19.593 --> 00:21.028
I give up law school
and we're going broke

00:21.061 --> 00:22.362
so you can have a publicist.

00:22.396 --> 00:24.933
I'm so sick of this shit.

00:24.965 --> 00:27.901
Pushing her to reconnect
with an old flame.

00:27.934 --> 00:30.405
I've told you guys
about my friend Jeremiah.

00:30.438 --> 00:31.339
We got too close.

00:31.372 --> 00:34.042
It's been a long time.

00:34.074 --> 00:35.676
I've got one more resolution.

00:35.710 --> 00:38.346
And I finally broke my
rule, and dated a musician.

00:38.385 --> 00:43.447
But what happens on tour,
does not stay on tour.

00:43.564 --> 00:44.570
- This is cute.
- Yeah.

00:44.602 --> 00:46.537
They got all the good stuff. Look.

00:46.569 --> 00:47.304
Those are like two sets of panties.

00:47.337 --> 00:47.804
No, it's one.

00:48.973 --> 00:49.874
There's just a hole in the middle

00:49.907 --> 00:50.874
for the important things.

00:50.907 --> 00:51.642
OK, y'all.

00:51.675 --> 00:52.343
This is a lot.

00:52.376 --> 00:52.910
Look at.

00:52.943 --> 00:54.212
It's a harness.

00:54.245 --> 00:55.812
Like, what are you harnessing?

00:55.846 --> 00:58.549
I want to be a fly on the wall
when you try and put this on.

00:58.581 --> 01:00.684
I would be in the
bathroom for four hours,

01:00.718 --> 01:02.820
and I think I would come
out, and he would be like...

01:02.853 --> 01:03.988
He'd be asleep.

01:04.019 --> 01:05.388
...so confused.

01:05.422 --> 01:07.424
There's panties in this little box.

01:07.457 --> 01:08.392
Perfect.

01:08.425 --> 01:08.960
They're probably edible.

01:11.428 --> 01:14.599
Are you  ....  kidding me?

01:14.632 --> 01:16.234
What's that?

01:16.266 --> 01:18.502
I can't believe Bryant
took Sammy on tour with him.

01:18.535 --> 01:19.603
Wait, who?

01:19.636 --> 01:21.873
His little photographer, Sammy.

01:21.906 --> 01:25.376
Still trying to weasel
her way into his world.

01:25.409 --> 01:26.711
No.

01:26.743 --> 01:27.945
I don't have anything
nice to say about her...

01:29.513 --> 01:30.915
...because I feel like
she's a wounded animal,

01:30.948 --> 01:33.684
like Bryant turned her down,
and then he got with me.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.453
What is it these girls traveling around

01:35.486 --> 01:36.654
with boys that...

01:36.686 --> 01:38.655
 ....  snakes, that's what it is.

01:38.689 --> 01:40.791
I was looking forward to
seeing Bryant when he comes

01:40.825 --> 01:42.025
through Nashville tomorrow.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.894
Now, I'm just pissed off.

01:43.927 --> 01:47.798
But that's something I'll have
to bring up when I talk to him.

01:47.832 --> 01:52.403
You were talking to Jeremiah
for quite a while at Ole Red.

01:52.436 --> 01:53.904
Jeremiah Carter.

01:53.937 --> 01:55.505
Was it awkward?

01:55.538 --> 01:56.341
No.

01:56.374 --> 01:57.809
It wasn't awkward.

01:57.841 --> 01:58.909
It was just... I was really
excited, like oh, my god,

01:58.942 --> 01:59.776
you're back.

01:59.809 --> 02:00.945
We should hang out.

02:00.978 --> 02:03.681
He asked me to meet him for dinner.

02:03.713 --> 02:05.916
Like that you, Kerry, and Jeremiah.

02:05.949 --> 02:07.985
I mean, Kerry wasn't there.

02:08.019 --> 02:11.289
Wait, you had dinner with him?

02:11.322 --> 02:12.762
- Why?
- Why?

02:12.825 --> 02:14.459
He was like my best friend
for two years, you guys.

02:14.491 --> 02:15.759
He was there when Wolf was born.

02:15.793 --> 02:18.396
Ah, are you going to
tell Kerry you saw him?

02:18.428 --> 02:19.401
Probably not.

02:19.412 --> 02:22.734
You don't think you're
playing with fire?

02:22.766 --> 02:24.434
You're definitely playing with fire.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:40.617 --> 02:41.352
Hey.

02:41.384 --> 02:42.986
Oh, my gosh.

02:43.020 --> 02:43.688
It's happening.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.365
- Yay.
- Woo.

02:45.406 --> 02:47.108
...I'm going to Miss USA!

02:47.164 --> 02:50.134
So I was thinking like
this casual black-white.

02:50.168 --> 02:51.034
Yeah, of course.

02:51.068 --> 02:52.437
You have to take that.

02:52.470 --> 02:55.038
It kind of says like,
I'm here, but I'm fierce.

02:55.072 --> 02:56.174
You're too much.

02:56.206 --> 02:57.841
This is going in a garment bag.

02:57.875 --> 02:58.977
Girl, yaas.

02:59.009 --> 03:00.745
Then the second one is this one.

03:00.777 --> 03:01.846
It's off-the-shoulder.

03:01.878 --> 03:03.080
It's just like, hello.

03:03.114 --> 03:04.248
I'm here.

03:04.282 --> 03:06.384
I'm alive. I'm at breakfast.
And here I am.

03:06.417 --> 03:07.791
- Perfect.
- Throw it in, right?

03:07.803 --> 03:08.204
Yeah.

03:08.215 --> 03:09.104
Put it. Of course.

03:09.182 --> 03:10.889
Do you recognize this thing?

03:10.921 --> 03:11.923
So sexy.

03:11.955 --> 03:13.424
It just does everything for you.

03:13.458 --> 03:14.292
Right.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.726
It elongates you.

03:15.759 --> 03:17.127
You look tall, and skinny, and pretty.

03:17.161 --> 03:18.082
Yes, ma'am.

03:18.093 --> 03:20.864
It's so good to have another
pageant girl's opinion.

03:20.897 --> 03:22.834
How many suitcases are you taking?

03:22.866 --> 03:24.234
Like, only three.

03:24.268 --> 03:27.038
Also, you want to see my Miss USA dress?

03:27.071 --> 03:28.173
I can't wait.

03:28.205 --> 03:29.107
Oh, my gosh.

03:29.139 --> 03:30.007
I'm freaking out.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.408
I'm freaking out, too.

03:31.442 --> 03:32.444
Wait, who ended up
making your Miss USA dress?

03:32.499 --> 03:33.900
Giovanni.

03:33.911 --> 03:35.219
Of course. It's going to be a dream.

03:35.230 --> 03:36.008
Custom.

03:36.079 --> 03:38.149
If I gain a pound, I'm  .... .

03:43.253 --> 03:44.021
Steve-o.

03:44.055 --> 03:45.056
Hello.

03:45.089 --> 03:48.193
Let's get the jacket on first.

03:48.226 --> 03:50.360
All right. Hop up.

03:50.394 --> 03:51.795
How's it feel?

03:51.829 --> 03:53.865
I mean, the jacket makes everything.

03:53.897 --> 03:54.896
So what's the suit for?

03:54.942 --> 03:58.402
I'm getting this for Ali's
pageant... for Miss USA.

03:58.436 --> 03:59.837
Are you bringing Bailey?

03:59.871 --> 04:03.107
Yes.
I'm absolutely in love with this girl.

04:03.139 --> 04:04.842
I want you to meet her.

04:04.876 --> 04:06.343
You've known all my girlfriends
since I was 10 years old.

04:06.377 --> 04:08.413
She's, like, such a breath of fresh air.

04:08.446 --> 04:10.048
Well, let's see if she's different.

04:10.103 --> 04:11.271
What do you think?

04:11.282 --> 04:12.672
- I think it looks good.
- Yeah?

04:12.683 --> 04:14.266
- Yeah.
- You have time for a beer?

04:14.280 --> 04:14.881
I mean, yeah.

04:14.892 --> 04:16.560
Always.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.457
So there's like this one
layer, and then there's like...

04:20.291 --> 04:21.058
...the chiffon.

04:21.091 --> 04:21.993
Girl.

04:22.024 --> 04:23.927
It's absolutely stunning.

04:23.960 --> 04:24.561
I know.

04:24.578 --> 04:25.880
I think so, too...

04:25.929 --> 04:26.546
The whole thing.

04:26.562 --> 04:28.499
This is the most beautiful
dress I've ever seen.

04:28.532 --> 04:29.533
I've got to touch it.

04:29.566 --> 04:30.467
So is this hand-done?

04:30.501 --> 04:32.019
Yeah, it's handmade.

04:33.537 --> 04:35.405
I mean, because I have none.

04:35.438 --> 04:37.008
Truth.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.944
Girl, I'm so sad I can't come.

04:39.977 --> 04:43.046
If I didn't have this booking,
I would 100% be there.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.216
Jackson told me he was
coming, which is fabulous.

04:45.248 --> 04:47.385
I would hope that he would,
because why would he not?

04:47.417 --> 04:52.155
But he said he was bringing
his new girlfriend Baylee.

04:52.188 --> 04:54.391
I was like, are you kidding me?

04:54.424 --> 04:57.395
This is not just like a
pageant, this is Miss USA.

04:57.428 --> 04:58.029
So like...

04:58.061 --> 04:58.896
Yeah.

04:58.929 --> 04:59.930
This is your moment.

04:59.963 --> 05:00.864
It's like, this is about Ali.

05:00.897 --> 05:02.267
True.

05:02.299 --> 05:03.867
He needs to come and
support you as his cousin.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.002
Right.

05:05.035 --> 05:07.137
So what if you like text Jackson?

05:07.171 --> 05:08.540
And say what?

05:08.573 --> 05:10.308
I mean, just tell him that you really

05:10.340 --> 05:11.975
want him to be there to support you,

05:12.008 --> 05:14.078
but maybe this isn't the
right time for Baylee to come.

05:14.111 --> 05:15.480
But I don't know, you
should come by yourself?

05:15.513 --> 05:16.847
I mean, like, I have no idea.

05:16.881 --> 05:17.583
Say that.

05:17.646 --> 05:20.218
I would rather you come by yourself.

05:20.251 --> 05:21.185
But it's the truth.

05:21.217 --> 05:23.087
Ali, this is your moment.

05:23.119 --> 05:24.321
I know.

05:24.354 --> 05:26.991
You can say that and not be selfish.

05:27.023 --> 05:28.926
OK.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.263
Let's say, I'd rather you focus on me.

05:32.296 --> 05:34.132
Leave her at home.

05:34.164 --> 05:36.066
Bye, girl.

05:36.099 --> 05:38.503
That's harsh.

05:38.535 --> 05:40.103
But I like it.

05:40.136 --> 05:40.971
Cheers.

05:41.005 --> 05:42.006
Cheers.

05:42.039 --> 05:43.640
What do you think of that suit?

05:43.665 --> 05:45.301
A few tweaks we'll make it work.

05:45.342 --> 05:47.445
- I hope so.
- It'll be right for the occasion.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.446
Good.

05:54.861 --> 05:56.420
Unbelievable.

05:56.453 --> 05:58.622
Forget her. I'm not going
to this stupid pageant.

05:58.655 --> 05:59.256
Really?

05:59.289 --> 06:00.458
Yeah.

06:00.491 --> 06:01.159
Are you serious?

06:01.191 --> 06:02.926
Yeah. I'm dead serious man.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.611
Why not?

06:03.622 --> 06:07.065
Ali just texted that she
doesn't want Bailey there.

06:07.097 --> 06:08.432
You have to be there.

06:08.465 --> 06:09.967
 ....  no.

06:10.001 --> 06:13.071
I'm not saying I can't
leave Bailey, but no.

06:13.104 --> 06:14.539
What a slap in the face.

06:14.571 --> 06:17.040
Dude, Ali can do whatever
the hell she wants to do,

06:17.073 --> 06:18.909
but I'm not going to go to that pageant.

06:41.032 --> 06:42.567
- Hey.
- How you doing?

06:42.599 --> 06:44.501
Good to see you.

06:45.268 --> 06:46.069
Oh, yeah.

06:46.102 --> 06:47.337
- What is it?
- Can I taste it?

06:47.371 --> 06:48.867
Yeah. Yeah, please.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.243
Bourbon vanilla.

06:52.275 --> 06:53.244
Whiskey.

06:53.277 --> 06:54.479
Shut up.

06:56.112 --> 06:57.482
Tell me what's been going on.

06:57.515 --> 07:02.152
Kerry's new publicist's name's Tori.

07:02.186 --> 07:03.988
When did you talk to him last?

07:04.020 --> 07:05.088
I have no idea.

07:05.121 --> 07:06.424
Once upon a time.

07:06.457 --> 07:10.294
You're still in the honeymoon stage.

07:10.326 --> 07:12.262
Everything's great.

07:12.296 --> 07:14.198
I did tell my friend
Jessica we had dinner.

07:14.231 --> 07:15.011
Yeah.

07:15.026 --> 07:17.669
And she definitely gave
me some unwarranted advice

07:17.701 --> 07:19.069
about you.

07:19.102 --> 07:21.304
She told me I was playing with fire.

07:21.337 --> 07:23.708
That's interesting.

07:23.741 --> 07:26.176
What did she say that around?

07:26.210 --> 07:30.548
Just, I guess, having a single
guy friend that I'm close to.

07:32.015 --> 07:34.163
I mean, dinner was fun, though, yeah?

07:34.249 --> 07:35.366
Yeah.

07:35.377 --> 07:37.254
I know you appreciate the friendship

07:37.287 --> 07:40.490
because I'm honest with you.

07:40.523 --> 07:45.328
I think there can be a happiness
that you realize is a choice.

07:45.361 --> 07:49.099
Like, I want you to just,
regardless of how Kerry feels,

07:49.133 --> 07:50.168
seek your own happiness.

08:07.524 --> 08:09.293
That's right.

08:11.429 --> 08:12.797
Ooh, that's pretty.

08:12.829 --> 08:14.531
This is so fun.

08:14.564 --> 08:16.401
Awesome.

08:16.434 --> 08:17.368
We both like that?

08:17.401 --> 08:18.970
All right.

08:19.002 --> 08:20.370
How low does that go?

08:20.403 --> 08:21.773
It is one of our lower dresses.

08:21.805 --> 08:22.539
Yeah.

08:22.573 --> 08:23.374
Let's do it.

08:23.406 --> 08:26.643
Let's get crazy.

08:26.677 --> 08:27.978
Ooh.

08:29.914 --> 08:30.949
I love that.

08:30.982 --> 08:33.482
I should be on top of the cake.

08:33.515 --> 08:35.852
Back it up.

08:35.885 --> 08:38.789
Imported Italian lace.

08:38.823 --> 08:40.591
Is this in your budget?

08:40.623 --> 08:42.759
Honestly, I haven't looked at
the price tag, so I don't know.

08:42.793 --> 08:43.461
I just love it.

08:43.493 --> 08:44.896
I want to try one more, though.

08:44.929 --> 08:46.331
Yeah, do it.

08:46.363 --> 08:48.532
Ta-da.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.835
- Do you love it?
- Oh, my gosh.

08:50.867 --> 08:51.935
I feel like a bride.

08:51.968 --> 08:53.438
It's incredible.

08:53.471 --> 08:55.306
Which one do you think
Dre will like more?

08:55.338 --> 08:57.874
You're such a good bride for
thinking about what Dre wants.

08:57.907 --> 08:59.910
How many dress shops did you go to?

08:59.944 --> 09:00.812
None.

09:00.844 --> 09:01.745
I ordered mine online.

09:01.779 --> 09:03.014
What?

09:03.046 --> 09:04.949
You are so funny.

09:04.982 --> 09:07.819
Would you still do
that same thing today?

09:07.852 --> 09:08.586
No.

09:08.618 --> 09:09.686
Really? Yeah.

09:09.719 --> 09:10.821
See how it feels when you
sit down, because you're

09:10.854 --> 09:12.456
going to be sitting down a lot.

09:12.490 --> 09:13.524
Ohh.

09:13.556 --> 09:14.491
Yeah.

09:14.525 --> 09:15.492
I feel so comfortable.

09:15.526 --> 09:17.495
Can you relax your belly?

09:17.527 --> 09:18.528
Yeah.

09:18.561 --> 09:19.663
Not even sucking in right now.

09:19.697 --> 09:20.932
Could you pee in it?

09:20.964 --> 09:21.932
Could I pee in it?

09:21.966 --> 09:23.001
With some help, probably.

09:25.602 --> 09:26.636
So how are you doing?

09:26.670 --> 09:27.471
Good.

09:27.503 --> 09:28.805
I want to hear about you and Kerry.

09:28.838 --> 09:29.806
Yeah.

09:29.839 --> 09:31.041
I'm in, like, bride mode.

09:31.074 --> 09:31.876
Yeah.

09:31.909 --> 09:32.744
It's not about me.

09:32.776 --> 09:34.645
Yeah, it is.

09:34.678 --> 09:38.049
Well, I know you hate
hearing about this,

09:38.082 --> 09:39.884
but I saw Jeremiah again.

09:39.916 --> 09:42.085
Oh.

09:42.118 --> 09:43.687
Hm.

09:43.721 --> 09:49.126
And I think we are
getting kind of close again.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.428
Right.

09:52.563 --> 09:57.802
I think if it were me in the situation,

09:57.834 --> 10:05.008
I just feel like I'd want
to be fair to my husband,

10:05.041 --> 10:06.977
even if he didn't deserve it.

10:07.011 --> 10:10.481
I don't think you understand what like...

10:10.514 --> 10:14.485
six years of feeling lonely is.

10:14.517 --> 10:20.157
I just feel like fairness is
like long gone at this point.

10:20.190 --> 10:21.958
I don't want to sound insensitive, Rach.

10:21.992 --> 10:25.128
I feel like I wouldn't be a good
friend to you if I was saying,

10:25.161 --> 10:27.798
like, yeah, just
disregard your marriage.

10:27.832 --> 10:33.703
But sometimes in a marriage,
you're just surviving.

10:33.737 --> 10:36.633
And I think that when I met Jeremiah,

10:36.650 --> 10:38.318
I was just kind of surviving.

10:38.329 --> 10:41.879
So he filled a place that
he probably shouldn't

10:41.911 --> 10:43.547
have filled emotionally.

10:43.580 --> 10:46.183
It's where the whole for better or worse

10:46.217 --> 10:47.452
comes in, I guess.

10:47.484 --> 10:48.685
This happens all the time.

10:48.718 --> 10:50.704
People are married and they're lonely.

10:54.724 --> 10:57.794
Now, do you want my
opinion on the matter?

10:57.805 --> 11:01.411
- Or do you just want me to listen?
- I just

11:01.450 --> 11:05.213
want a girlfriend to
be like a safe place,

11:05.236 --> 11:11.776
and I feel like you do
put me and Kerry above me.

11:11.809 --> 11:14.045
I guess I don't
understand the difference.

11:14.078 --> 11:15.746
I feel like you and Kerry are one, so...

11:15.779 --> 11:17.735
I think that's where we disagree.

11:27.056 --> 11:30.527
♪ And I thought
that love would be pretty, ♪

11:30.560 --> 11:34.764
♪ but I didn't know a damn thing
about what love was really. ♪

11:34.798 --> 11:37.902
♪ It's a cup always empty and still they ♪

11:37.934 --> 11:43.473
♪ need more, so you pour, and
you pour till you break. ♪

11:43.506 --> 11:47.745
♪ But I can't find the right words to say. ♪

11:47.777 --> 11:50.981
♪ No, I can't find the right words to say. ♪

11:58.021 --> 11:59.589
One more.

11:59.622 --> 12:01.992
Thank you so much, guys,
for coming out tonight.

12:02.026 --> 12:04.127
My name's Kerry Degman.
It's been a pleasure.

12:04.152 --> 12:06.387
I'll be hanging out in the back.
Y'all come see me.

12:11.202 --> 12:12.170
How are you?

12:12.203 --> 12:13.603
- Fabulous.
- Good.

12:13.636 --> 12:14.537
Hey, man. Best of luck.

12:14.572 --> 12:16.141
Absolutely. Hey, thank you, man.
I need it.

12:17.841 --> 12:21.011
- You were awesome.
- Thank you.

12:21.045 --> 12:21.978
Perfect.

12:22.011 --> 12:22.713
Thank you.

12:22.746 --> 12:23.680
Thank you.

12:23.713 --> 12:24.549
Thanks so much, ladies.

12:24.582 --> 12:25.116
Great to meet you.

12:25.149 --> 12:26.017
Appreciate it.

12:26.050 --> 12:26.751
Y'all have a good night.

12:26.784 --> 12:27.619
You, too.

12:31.689 --> 12:33.805
Hey, baby. What's going on?

12:33.829 --> 12:35.026
Hey, hon.

12:35.059 --> 12:36.194
What you doing?

12:36.227 --> 12:37.727
We just finished the show, and I

12:37.761 --> 12:39.863
am at the merch table,
kind of meeting fans.

12:39.896 --> 12:40.830
Is everything OK?

12:40.863 --> 12:41.965
You and Wolfgang are fine?

12:41.998 --> 12:43.300
Yeah, Wolfgang's fine.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.267
Can I...

12:44.300 --> 12:45.136
Is Tori there with you?

12:45.169 --> 12:46.537
Tori is here.

12:46.569 --> 12:48.305
She's helping me with the merch table.

12:48.338 --> 12:49.607
It's so late.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.242
I thought you'd be home by now.

12:51.275 --> 12:53.778
Should I wait up?

12:53.817 --> 12:58.849
I'll be home as soon
as all of this dies down.

12:58.860 --> 13:01.169
There's still a good amount of
people here trying to hang out.

13:02.652 --> 13:03.887
Hey thanks, guys. Thank you.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.756
Appreciate it. Thanks for coming out.

13:05.789 --> 13:06.324
Kerry, I love you, dude.

13:06.357 --> 13:08.226
Thanks, guys.

13:08.258 --> 13:09.059
I'll call you back.

13:09.093 --> 13:10.194
All right? Bye.

13:10.227 --> 13:11.661
Wait, b...

13:13.363 --> 13:15.232
Who was that?

13:15.266 --> 13:19.837
Oh, it's Rachyl, just checking in.

13:19.870 --> 13:22.139
We're just going to keep this over here.

13:22.171 --> 13:23.840
- OK.
- All right.

13:23.873 --> 13:25.609
- Well, let's stay focused.
- Let's do it.

13:29.380 --> 13:32.617
I think it's time for another beer.

13:54.671 --> 13:56.674
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:56.707 --> 13:57.742
I thought you might
need some clean clothes.

13:57.775 --> 13:59.925
- Thank you.
- How's the tour?

13:59.956 --> 14:02.933
It's frickin' hot everywhere.
I'm always tired.

14:03.066 --> 14:04.648
But I missed you.

14:04.681 --> 14:08.819
Um, you know I came here today,

14:08.830 --> 14:11.295
interrupting your unpacking,
because you've been avoiding

14:11.306 --> 14:13.824
all my texts about Sammy.

14:13.857 --> 14:21.198
I'm just curious, I guess, like
what is going on with you two?

14:21.231 --> 14:24.560
Sammy has been very loyal to us,

14:24.571 --> 14:26.871
but there's never even
a thing happening there.

14:26.904 --> 14:28.673
Really, though?

14:28.705 --> 14:30.240
Really?

14:30.274 --> 14:32.977
Because what you're saying, what
I'm seeing, what I'm hearing

14:33.010 --> 14:34.278
is very different.

14:34.310 --> 14:36.413
It looks different
on the outside, and...

14:36.447 --> 14:37.982
It looks terrible.

14:38.015 --> 14:39.383
It looks terrible.

14:39.415 --> 14:42.118
I don't understand why you
took her on tour again.

14:42.151 --> 14:45.823
It's really  ....  irritating.

14:45.856 --> 14:49.860
I do apologize if I haven't
been respecting your feelings,

14:49.892 --> 14:51.194
but at the end of the day, I want

14:51.227 --> 14:52.929
to continue to work with her because she

14:52.963 --> 14:54.298
does good work for us.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.932
Despite the ups and downs
of is this a thing...

14:55.966 --> 14:57.368
Even though she's in love with you,

14:57.401 --> 14:59.370
and you know that
she's in love with you?

14:59.402 --> 15:01.938
Look, the politics of
being in a band are messy.

15:01.972 --> 15:06.010
I'm going to call bullshit
on that, but that's cute.

15:06.043 --> 15:07.945
Maybe we'll just go with this.

15:07.977 --> 15:09.412
Have you ever had feelings for her?

15:09.445 --> 15:10.880
Do you have feelings for her?

15:10.914 --> 15:12.987
Will you have feelings for her?

15:19.890 --> 15:26.797
You're just like every other
musician that I've ever met.

15:26.829 --> 15:28.264
Good luck.

15:28.298 --> 15:29.232
Tell Sammy I said, hey.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.735
See you never.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.296
And now, your top 10 finalists.

16:00.329 --> 16:03.300
Madison Knight, South Dakota.

16:09.340 --> 16:11.842
Alexandra Harper, Tennessee.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.244
Fabulous.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.978
Mwah.

16:15.794 --> 16:17.597
Top ten. That means something
good, right?

16:17.629 --> 16:19.331
I don't have the first
clue about pageants.

16:19.364 --> 16:20.899
I know more about pageants than any man

16:20.932 --> 16:22.334
needs to know about pageants.

16:22.368 --> 16:25.942
You could be in there.

16:26.059 --> 16:27.489
- No.
- Yes, you could.

16:27.544 --> 16:28.340
Shut up.

16:28.373 --> 16:29.541
I bet she's pissed that I'm not there.

16:31.343 --> 16:34.052
If she wins this thing, she's
going to rub it in my face.

16:34.185 --> 16:35.715
- Forever.
- Forever.

16:35.748 --> 16:36.815
You weren't there.

16:36.849 --> 16:38.150
What the heck?

16:38.182 --> 16:39.384
Coming up next, the final five.

16:39.417 --> 16:41.152
I just don't there to be any tension

16:41.185 --> 16:42.454
because you're not there.

16:42.488 --> 16:43.856
There's going to be tension, like she...

16:43.888 --> 16:45.590
Well, I don't want it
to be because of me, then.

16:45.601 --> 16:46.538
How about that?

16:46.549 --> 16:49.527
I get why she wouldn't want me
there because it's her thing.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.397
But at the same time, like I just

16:51.430 --> 16:53.933
hope she doesn't think that
you're not there because I

16:53.965 --> 16:55.533
wouldn't let you go.

16:55.566 --> 16:57.869
This is Ali's world, and
we're all living in it.

16:57.902 --> 17:00.373
You know? She wants all my attention.

17:00.406 --> 17:03.541
She wants all this to
happen on her terms.

17:03.575 --> 17:05.877
And it's been on her terms for forever.

17:05.910 --> 17:07.779
Now it's on my terms.

17:07.811 --> 17:09.381
I want to be with you.

17:09.415 --> 17:12.652
I want to focus on you,
focus on my goals for us.

17:12.685 --> 17:15.221
And unfortunately for Ali,
that doesn't involve her.

17:15.252 --> 17:18.455
Well, I'm going to let
you all duke that one out.

17:18.490 --> 17:19.892
But I want to be left out of it.

17:19.925 --> 17:21.527
I mean, you will be left out of it.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.930
- Just like, of course...
- It sounds like I was already brought into it.

17:23.963 --> 17:26.531
Everything will be fine.

17:26.564 --> 17:28.366
OK.

17:28.398 --> 17:30.502
Hope so.

17:30.535 --> 17:35.740
The first one to make it
to the final five is Nevada.

17:35.773 --> 17:37.342
Oh, I am dying.

17:37.376 --> 17:38.344
I am dying.

17:38.377 --> 17:39.912
Nebraska.

17:39.945 --> 17:43.683
My heart is freaking out,

17:43.715 --> 17:45.550
having a panic attack.

17:45.583 --> 17:46.918
I need you to calm down.

17:46.952 --> 17:48.621
When she lost Miss
Tennessee the first time,

17:48.654 --> 17:50.690
she didn't speak for two weeks.

17:50.723 --> 17:53.358
North Carolina.

17:53.391 --> 17:54.859
So this is it.

17:54.893 --> 17:56.462
There's one spot left.

17:56.494 --> 17:59.799
The last contestant to
make it to the final five is,

18:02.033 --> 18:03.361
South Dakota.

18:03.372 --> 18:04.436
[MUSIC - SILVERBERG FEAT.

18:05.570 --> 18:06.539
Oh. Man.

18:15.781 --> 18:18.451
I bet she's so upset right now.

18:18.483 --> 18:19.551
Sharon's going to be mad.

18:19.585 --> 18:20.786
Mom's going to be mad.

18:20.819 --> 18:22.555
Ali's going to be mad.

18:22.588 --> 18:27.792
I just hope that regardless,
that she's not upset with me

18:27.826 --> 18:29.829
that you didn't go.

18:29.861 --> 18:31.830
Oh,  ....  me.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.635
Next time on "Music City."

18:47.362 --> 18:49.479
Y'all grabbed a meal,
like just the two of you?

18:49.497 --> 18:51.246
Ali's going to be
pissed at you regardless.

18:51.262 --> 18:52.597
Did you go to Miss USA?

18:52.630 --> 18:53.865
I didn't make it.

18:53.898 --> 18:55.466
You look at me like you want to just...

18:55.500 --> 18:56.768
Claw your eyeballs out.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.270
Baylee, do not .... with me and Jackson.

18:59.303 --> 19:00.304
This is bullshit.

19:00.338 --> 19:01.740
Did you hook up with Bryant?

19:01.772 --> 19:02.840
 ....  off.

19:02.874 --> 19:04.509
Slut.

19:04.541 --> 19:07.478
So I hung out with Jeremiah
today at the Airstream.

19:07.511 --> 19:09.181
I don't know what you want me to say.

19:09.213 --> 19:11.116
I want you to tell me
exactly what's going on.
