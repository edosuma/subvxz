00:49.560 --> 00:51.391
What's the word, Charlie?

00:51.520 --> 00:53.158
We going through, or what?

00:54.880 --> 00:57.189
Heading back through the truck?

00:58.720 --> 01:01.359
Come on, old timer, what are you doing?

01:05.160 --> 01:07.833
Uh, excuse me, sir. Can we help you?

01:07.960 --> 01:10.076
Can we help you with something?

01:10.200 --> 01:11.952
Did I miss the Spec?

01:12.760 --> 01:15.513
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
The show was this afternoon.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.595
Oh.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.230
Did you come with the folks
from Green Haven?

01:20.360 --> 01:23.875
Why don't we get out of the rain,
and we'll call them for you.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.309
No, no, no, no! I came on my own.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.910
No, it's okay. We're gonna call the home.
We're gonna have them come pick you up.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.793
I'm telling you,
I didn't come with the home!

01:32.920 --> 01:35.115
Why don't you take those rings
out of your head,

01:35.240 --> 01:36.992
and maybe you won't be deaf and dumb!

01:38.400 --> 01:40.436
Well, it's alive.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.279
I'm sorry, kid. I didn't mean that.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.074
Your rings look very

01:48.360 --> 01:49.315
pretty.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.753
Russ, why don't you take that walker
back to my trailer and finish packing up?

01:54.880 --> 01:57.872
Sir? Man, I gotta get you
out of this parking lot.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.232
Why don't you sit down in the wheelchair?
We'll go inside and make some calls.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.952
Come on, please.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.836
Malcolm, tell them to come through!

02:08.960 --> 02:10.359
Yeah. Hey, how you doing?

02:10.479 --> 02:12.914
I'm looking for a number
I can't seem to find in the book.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.077
It's for a nursing home called Green Haven.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.792
I hope they sweat.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.553
I walked right out of the door
and nobody noticed.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.908
Green Haven.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.636
It's a nursing home.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.957
Hello? Hello?

02:28.720 --> 02:31.075
Hagenbeck-Wallace! Before the wreck.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.069
Yeah. You know circuses?

02:34.200 --> 02:35.918
I should. I been on two.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.510
Hey, is there a relative maybe I can call?
Or another number you have?

02:39.640 --> 02:41.232
The first was the Benzini Brothers.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.033
Benzini Brothers? When?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.434
1931.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.118
'31 for how long?

02:50.840 --> 02:55.834
Now, you know the Benzini Brothers
never saw the end of '31.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.428
Are you telling me
that you were there for...

02:58.560 --> 03:00.039
-Right in the middle of it.
-Well, that's incredible,

03:00.160 --> 03:03.789
because after the Hartford fire
and the Hagenbeck-Wallace wreck,

03:03.920 --> 03:07.879
that's pretty much the most famous
circus disaster in history.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.309
Are you okay?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.639
You got anything to drink around here
that isn't apple juice?

03:22.960 --> 03:23.995
Uh...

03:24.760 --> 03:26.352
Yeah, I think so.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.640
-There you go.
-Thank you.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.879
I remember you.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.998
So, how long you been in that home?

03:51.120 --> 03:52.553
Too long.

03:52.680 --> 03:56.992
I don't know why they call it a home.
You don't know anybody there.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.237
They stuff you so full of drugs,
you don't care.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.638
Five kids and not one has a place for me
since their mother died.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.439
They take turns visiting on weekends.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.155
My son forgot
whose turn it was today, so...

04:14.880 --> 04:19.351
I can't blame him. The kid's 71.
He's starting to lose it up here.

04:20.279 --> 04:24.193
They're not bad kids.
It's not their fault I'm old.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.194
I had a good life, you know.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.752
A big life.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.078
Take a seat. Yeah.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.158
I'm sorry. You know what?
My name is Charlie O'Brien III.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.154
Jacob Jankowski, the only.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.319
That's good.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.233
Don't you have to call the home?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.830
I think we should let them sweat.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.748
But if I could, I was wondering,

04:58.880 --> 05:02.919
you know, could you talk to me
about what happened in 1931?

05:08.520 --> 05:10.317
Gonna need another bottle of this.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.837
It was a big day,
that last day of my final exam.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.518
I couldn't move fast enough.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.517
My life was
finally gonna start,

05:19.640 --> 05:22.393
and I knew exactly where it was taking me.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.791
Inside our house,
there was no sign of a Depression.

05:31.920 --> 05:35.117
My mother and father had left Poland
in much worse condition.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.916
To them, nobody could be poor in America
if they had half a brain in their head.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.952
Love you, too, Mommy.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.632
After six years of dissections, castrations,

06:06.760 --> 06:10.673
and shoving my arm up a cow's ass
more times than I care to remember,

06:10.800 --> 06:14.998
by the end of that day, I knew I'd be
a Cornell graduate of Veterinary Science.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.673
And by the end of that night,

06:17.800 --> 06:21.759
I'd be the first man Catherine Hale
ever invited into her bed.

06:21.880 --> 06:22.915
She was nuts about me.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.070
You will have two hours
to complete the exam.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.192
When you have finished the exam,
close the booklet,

06:30.320 --> 06:33.676
turn it face downwards
and raise your hands.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.358
When I have acknowledged you,

06:35.480 --> 06:39.996
you may bring the exam up to me
and leave.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.553
You may begin.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.153
I had a new life all planned.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.633
Then with the opening of a door,

06:49.840 --> 06:51.910
every plan I had vanished.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.712
Mr. Jankowski?

06:55.320 --> 06:57.436
May we have a word with you?

07:12.400 --> 07:16.188
Jacob, I'm afraid there's been
a car accident.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.876
It's right in there, son.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.753
Is there any other family to call?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.636
No. No, it's just me.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.715
According to our records,
there is no mistake, Mr. Jankowski.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.991
The house and all their assets,
including your father's practice,

08:10.120 --> 08:12.076
are property of the bank
in default of the loan.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.710
I'm telling you, you're wrong.
My father owned that house outright.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.310
These documents are dated four years ago.
He signed them.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.591
Did they need money
for any reason four years ago?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.676
My tuition.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.392
Well, there you have it.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.718
Now, perhaps if you hadn't gone
to college, you'd still have a home.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.628
But in light of the way your father
ran his business, that's unlikely.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.876
My father was a good man.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.910
And when people came to him for help,
he gave it.

08:40.039 --> 08:43.429
Your father was an irresponsible man

08:43.559 --> 08:46.154
who let people pay him
in chickens, and eggs,

08:46.280 --> 08:49.158
and whatever they had instead of money.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.796
This Depression is with us
for a very long while. Believe me.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.388
And the only people standing
at the end of it

08:56.520 --> 08:58.875
will be the ones
who take what they need to survive.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.759
Don't make the same mistakes
as your father.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.431
I remember walking out
the front door

09:48.520 --> 09:51.353
and forcing myself not to look back.

09:55.160 --> 09:59.119
I couldn't stay where everything
reminded me of the life that was gone.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.231
And I didn't see the point
in going back to school.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.389
There were a lot of men in those days
with no home, no family,

10:06.520 --> 10:09.273
leaving small towns that were dying.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.755
The rumor was
that there were jobs in the cities,

10:11.880 --> 10:15.634
so I got it into my head
that I'd walk to Albany.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.318
I never made it.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.318
Hey, don't be messing with Blackie!

11:46.440 --> 11:48.749
Throwing people off trains
is one of the perks of his job.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.440
We don't need no bums on this train.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.836
Everybody, calm down here.
Grady, put that damn pistol away.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.350
Blackie, let him go.
And I mean on the inside of the train.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.836
I'm telling you, we don't need no trouble.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.598
I mean, look at them clothes.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.438
He ain't no bum.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.829
Don't be sore, kid.
It's almost a reflex with Blackie.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.949
I'm Camel.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.469
That there is Grady and Wade.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.358
I'm Jacob. Jankowski.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.710
Jankowski? Gorski!

12:28.400 --> 12:29.833
Mmm?

12:32.040 --> 12:34.554
You know,
you're pretty young to be on the rails.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.749
You running from something maybe?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.518
No, no, nothing like that.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.198
Where you headed?

12:40.240 --> 12:41.195
I don't know.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.709
You hungry? Out of work?

12:43.840 --> 12:46.752
There's no shame in that. No shame in that.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.711
Well, what can you do?

12:48.840 --> 12:50.956
Just about anything, I guess.

12:51.560 --> 12:55.109
We land in Deposit in the morning.
We'll get you some work for the day,

12:55.240 --> 12:58.152
and if you're still alive at the end of it,
I will take you to see August,

12:58.280 --> 13:01.829
the Lord and Master of the Known
and the Unknown Universe himself!

13:01.960 --> 13:03.234
Who's that?

13:03.360 --> 13:06.750
Hold on, chlopak,
you're in for the ride of your life.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.755
You see that?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.233
Wave, Olivia.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.396
Now, I don't know
if I picked that train,

15:34.520 --> 15:36.431
or that train picked me.

15:38.120 --> 15:42.272
But something told me
my mother and my father sent it my way.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.630
I'd like to think that, anyway.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.313
Hello, ma'am.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.394
Hey! What the hell
are you doing in here?

15:51.520 --> 15:54.159
Get out of there!
You ain't no menagerie man.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.158
Come on. I got you some work.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.635
-With the animals?
-Oh, you betcha!

16:04.520 --> 16:06.317
I've never seen so much manure.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.431
They pack them in 27 a car.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.112
How do you stand the smell?

16:16.520 --> 16:17.475
What smell?

16:19.040 --> 16:20.598
Ladies and gentlemen!

16:20.720 --> 16:24.235
Step right this way
to see the most dazzling collection

16:24.360 --> 16:28.399
of wonders, oddities and marvels
of the natural world!

16:28.520 --> 16:29.475
Step right this way...

16:29.600 --> 16:32.751
When Cecil gives the signal, you gotta
push the rubes in toward the entrance.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.758
Without them catching on,
or else there'll be a fight.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.632
...of pudgy perfection.

16:39.200 --> 16:43.113
All for one thin dime. And believe me,
it'll be the best dime you ever spent,

16:43.240 --> 16:47.438
I guarantee! Right this way!
Hand your dime to this fella right here.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.949
Ladies to the right. Gentlemen to the left.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.197
Folks, just put one foot in front
of the other, and the body will follow!

16:53.640 --> 16:55.119
Take this.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.356
Smack the sides with it

16:57.480 --> 17:00.756
if you see any heads trying to peek in
without paying.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.919
Silver.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.554
That's right. Good boy. Good boy.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.278
Are you okay?

18:30.160 --> 18:31.673
You're shaking a little bit.

18:41.880 --> 18:42.835
Excuse me, ma'am.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.911
Do you mind if I take a look?

18:57.160 --> 18:59.549
Performers to the Spec line!

18:59.680 --> 19:01.910
All performers to the Spec line!

19:02.040 --> 19:03.439
Walk on.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.794
Casey, move up.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.637
Showtime! Showtime!
Move it up. Let's go!

19:32.480 --> 19:35.233
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:35.360 --> 19:37.510
and children of all ages,

19:37.640 --> 19:40.712
welcome to the most
extravagant extravaganza

19:40.840 --> 19:42.831
the human eye can behold!

19:42.960 --> 19:46.157
Welcome the stars of the Benzini Brothers

19:46.280 --> 19:48.874
Most Spectacular Show on Earth!

20:56.720 --> 20:59.996
She didn't seem real to me at first.

21:00.120 --> 21:04.511
The way she looked inside that big top
under those lights.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.599
I thought I'd go blind from the shine.

21:09.800 --> 21:14.032
Benzini Brothers outdid God himself.
They created heaven in one day.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.352
And just as fast

21:17.080 --> 21:19.310
heaven was packed away and gone.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.719
Whoa, you better take a breath
before it all comes back up on you.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.159
Here.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.391
What is that?

21:35.520 --> 21:39.672
It's jake. It's all we got
when there's no real hooch.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.836
Damn Prohibition.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.589
It don't seem American
to deny a man a drink.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.837
Ain't it in the Constitution
that a man has got a right to happiness?

21:51.720 --> 21:54.712
Come on. I'll take you up to see August.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.279
Right now? It's the middle of the night.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.039
The only time circus people live,
even the boss.

21:59.160 --> 22:03.119
See, musicians and sideshow people
are above us roustabouts,

22:03.240 --> 22:04.832
but below the specialty acts,

22:04.960 --> 22:07.110
which, of course,
are below the ring stock animals.

22:07.240 --> 22:10.152
And everybody, everybody,
is below the bosses.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.759
Don't ever forget that.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.438
You wanna watch them clowns.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.068
Nobody ever gets a safe passage
through here.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.997
Oh, Lucinda, my dear!

22:18.120 --> 22:19.189
Good evening. How are you?

22:19.320 --> 22:21.197
Hello.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.753
You bring out the sunshine.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.348
Ooh. I know you. I saw you at my show.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.754
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.831
Want a private dance?

22:30.360 --> 22:33.352
-How's your pipe, kid?
- Barbara! Easy, now, Barbara.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.118
-Good night, ladies.
-Good night, Camel.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.958
-We like him, Camel.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.318
-Good night, Camel!
-Good night!

22:39.440 --> 22:43.149
Now try not to talk till
you're familiar with the vernacular,

22:43.280 --> 22:44.633
or you'll get your head bashed in.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.557
Like, townies are "rubes,"

22:46.680 --> 22:49.399
and performers aren't performers.
They're "kinkers,"

22:49.520 --> 22:52.512
but never call them that to their faces.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.595
So what do I call them?

22:53.720 --> 22:56.393
Performers. Just don't talk to them at all.
You'll live longer.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.637
Now be nice and quiet along here,
because we have to show some respect

22:59.760 --> 23:01.034
to the ladies and...

23:01.160 --> 23:03.469
-Gentlemen.
- Good evening.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.670
Hey, Camel, who's the woman
who works with the horses?

23:05.800 --> 23:09.839
That ain't no woman.
That's the boss's wife, Marlena.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.997
She's a star attraction.
And she don't talk to nobody,

23:13.120 --> 23:16.112
and you don't talk to her.
She'll just high-hat you anyway.

23:16.680 --> 23:21.117
You know, I got a son about your age
lives outside of Reading, Pennsylvania.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.073
I haven't seen him in years.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.714
Fix your shirt there.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.716
Before we do this, I got to ask you,
and I don't want to know your business,

23:33.840 --> 23:36.479
but I do know that
you ain't been on the road too long.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.114
So before you start, I got to ask you,

23:39.240 --> 23:44.234
if you got any kind of life to go back to,
that's what you should do.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.118
I don't.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.433
I am so sorry to hear that.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.755
Now, remember, when you meet August,
let him do the talking.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.316
Don't go blowing your wig.
And don't ever mention Ringling Brothers!

23:56.440 --> 23:59.432
He hates them bastards
worse than the Depression.

23:59.560 --> 24:03.439
Now this here is Earl,
and he's going to take you in.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.949
Earl, this here is Jacob.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.752
-Nice to meet you, Earl.
-Yeah.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.474
What's this, Earl?

24:17.600 --> 24:21.036
The stowaway that Polack rummy
took under his wing.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.712
College boy.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.070
I don't believe
we had the pleasure.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.077
Jacob Jankowski, sir.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.953
So, what am I supposed to do
with a Jacob Jankowski?

24:32.320 --> 24:33.594
I'm just looking for work, sir.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.280
-Ever worked a show, son?
-No, sir.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.834
-Ever seen a show?
-Yes, sir. Ringling Brothers.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.754
Ringling, eh?

24:49.760 --> 24:51.478
Yeah, but it was terrible.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.757
Well, they do try, don't they, boys?

25:01.400 --> 25:03.311
You seen our show?

25:03.440 --> 25:04.714
Yes, sir.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.796
Yeah? What's your favorite act?

25:06.920 --> 25:09.798
I like the one
with the black and white horses.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.719
You've got a good eye. My star attraction.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.949
Well, I do believe we're looking for a boy

25:17.120 --> 25:19.111
to carry water for the elephants.
Aren't we, Joe?

25:19.240 --> 25:20.753
We don't have any elephants.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.551
That sounds perfect.
I'd love to work with the animals.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.954
Come here.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.789
These from one day of work?

25:33.920 --> 25:34.989
Yes, sir.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.795
Why would a college boy
dirty his hands as a filthy roustabout?

25:38.920 --> 25:42.993
I guess because
out of all that dirt and sweat,

25:43.120 --> 25:46.829
working with these fellows you wouldn't
be caught dead in the daylight with,

25:46.960 --> 25:48.393
comes so much beauty.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.431
You grandstanding me, kid?

25:50.560 --> 25:51.959
No. No, sir.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.479
That was beautifully put.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.275
Yet you ride my train,
you eat my food without my permission

25:57.400 --> 26:01.518
while hard-working men labor all day
for the same privileges.

26:01.640 --> 26:05.633
And these filthy roustabouts are my family.
You, you are an intruder.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.079
Next stop, throw him off.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.555
-Probably studied poetry.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.830
I studied veterinary science, not poetry.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.077
And I can tell you one thing.
That star attraction horse of yours?

26:16.200 --> 26:19.078
It's not gonna be walking
in a few weeks, let alone performing.

26:19.480 --> 26:20.435
Earl? Wait.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.072
Veterinary sciences?

26:25.200 --> 26:27.191
-What school?
-Cornell.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.197
You're a Cornell graduate?

26:31.360 --> 26:35.239
He did work the rubes for me
this afternoon. He was pretty good.

26:35.360 --> 26:39.035
He shoveled horseshit all day.
That don't make him no horse doctor.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.196
I'm sure Ringling has his own vet.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.439
Cornell, come with me.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.354
-You surefooted, Cornell?
-Yeah.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.674
Good.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.078
It's incredible.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.874
Takes your breath away,
doesn't it?

27:22.520 --> 27:24.431
My star attraction is limping,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.755
and I can't get a new liberty horse
midseason.

27:26.880 --> 27:31.829
So you make sure the horse performs,
and the job is yours. Nine bucks a week.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.708
You do right by me, Cornell,

27:35.840 --> 27:37.956
I'll show you a life
most suckers can't even dream of.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.039
Come on!

27:45.880 --> 27:48.713
Yeah, I could use an educated man
around here.

27:51.560 --> 27:55.792
Gets pretty tiring talking
to my menagerie of trained seals.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.353
Come on!

28:15.040 --> 28:17.315
-Kinko.
-August.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.839
I have a roommate for you.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.030
-What is he?
-Jacob. Jankowski.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.673
I asked what, not who.

28:22.840 --> 28:25.912
This gentleman is the show's new vet.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.393
Ivy League, no less,

28:27.520 --> 28:30.876
which puts him a good deal higher
in my estimation than you.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.878
Perhaps you would like
to offer him your cot.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.912
I'll find you in the morning
to see about that horse, Cornell.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.677
That a Jack Russell? They're real smart.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.757
You're not getting the cot.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.032
-Darling, may I introduce to you...
- Careful.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.479
Jacob. Jankowski.

28:55.600 --> 29:00.355
Jacob Jankowski, Benzini Brothers'
very own Ivy League veterinarian.

29:01.640 --> 29:06.316
-He's the vet?
-Yeah. Studied at Cornell University.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.437
The right front hoof.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.869
-It's an abscess.
-Darling.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.157
It didn't look this bad in the show.
You need a hoof tester?

29:23.280 --> 29:24.269
No, I don't think so.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.915
It needs heat and cold until it breaks,
then it needs a salt wrap.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.234
It'll be fine.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.879
Come on, boy.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.275
-Help me in, Joe. Thank you.
- Yep.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.673
Come on, boy.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.079
Well?

29:46.680 --> 29:49.558
I didn't want to say anything
in front of Mrs. Rosenbluth.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.398
The horse has laminitis.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.919
English.

29:55.040 --> 29:59.511
The connective tissue between the hoof
and the coffin bone has been compromised.

29:59.640 --> 30:03.553
So when he walks, the coffin bone
rotates toward the sole of the hoof

30:03.680 --> 30:04.749
until it punctures through.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.349
But it hasn't punctured yet.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.950
No, it hasn't, but it's just a matter of time.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.069
And he's in a lot of pain.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.952
How much time?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.389
Two, three days.

30:16.520 --> 30:17.669
He needs to be put down.

30:21.120 --> 30:25.193
You know all this by just looking at it?
Is there nothing you can do?

30:25.320 --> 30:27.197
No. It's pretty severe.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.759
I'm sorry.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.598
Well, I appreciate it.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.589
Darling, Cornell here agrees with you.
It's nothing really to worry about.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.438
Joe, get Pete to help Marlena.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.596
Pete's gonna feed the cats.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.598
No, we'll do that.
You just take care of him. Come on.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.958
They get a bucket each.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.800
Are you sure they like this stuff?
It's gone bad.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.755
--No. They like goats.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.839
We're all out of goats.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.792
Why don't you start
with Rex here in the middle?

31:15.120 --> 31:18.192
What do I do,
just open the door and toss it in?

31:18.320 --> 31:21.676
Unless you think a formal sit-down
is more appropriate.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.633
Slow and quiet.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.955
He won't notice you're there.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.993
Didn't they cover this in class?

31:51.120 --> 31:55.272
Place it in gently. Don't throw it.
You don't want to startle him.

32:10.160 --> 32:13.072
-You think that's funny?
-Yes, I do.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.799
-I could have lost my arm.
-No, you couldn't have.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.638
He doesn't have any teeth.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.395
Does it hurt?

32:24.480 --> 32:25.595
Like this?

32:27.880 --> 32:30.917
Your gut tells you
to shoot my star attraction?

32:31.040 --> 32:34.476
No treatment, no hoof tester,
just your Cornell gut.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.272
You know how a circus survives?

32:36.400 --> 32:40.518
You said it yourself, kid.
On blood, sweat, pain and shit.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.870
When a circus begins to die
and animals eat garbage,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.036
you know what men eat? Nothing.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.596
Your heart goes out to an animal suffering.
Well, that's noble, and that's good,

32:48.720 --> 32:52.076
but all that tells me
is that you never saw men suffer.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.839
So before I get back from town,

32:54.960 --> 32:57.599
you do whatever it is they taught you
in that Ivy League sandbox

32:57.720 --> 33:00.553
to get that horse ready for the parade.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.069
As long as we can walk, we play.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.956
It's not an abscess, is it?

33:22.720 --> 33:24.233
He's going to founder.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.678
It's okay, baby.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.713
I should have taken him out of the show.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.877
It's not your fault. It happens.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.753
It's not uncommon,

33:39.880 --> 33:42.758
but he is suffering.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.518
And the pain is only gonna get worse.

33:45.920 --> 33:49.117
The right thing to do
would be to put him down.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.039
That's not going to happen, is it?

33:58.640 --> 34:01.871
Not when August can get
a few more shows out of him.

34:02.920 --> 34:07.072
Around here, everybody works
till they're run into the ground.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.431
Nobody stops, nobody dies
until August says so.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.158
It's okay, baby.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.439
What about August?

35:00.800 --> 35:03.268
I'm the vet. It's my decision.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.913
It'll be your last one.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.355
Listen, you should go.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.077
No, I'll keep him calm.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.079
Good boy.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.713
Hush, little baby, don't say a word

35:26.160 --> 35:28.310
Mama 's gonna buy you a mockingbird

35:51.920 --> 35:53.558
Are you all right?

35:56.640 --> 35:58.278
I'll be all right.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.153
Mr. Jankowski.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.755
I'll be sorry to see you go.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.755
Roll over. Turn around.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.314
Turn around. Good girl. Sit. Good girl.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.392
Up! Up! Up, Queenie!

37:00.840 --> 37:04.116
This circus, my circus,
is a sovereign nation.

37:04.240 --> 37:07.312
You break my law,
you have to pay a penalty.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.476
I tell you to fix a horse, you shoot it?

37:09.600 --> 37:12.239
That's breaking my law.
The penalty is red-lighting.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.318
You need to get off the train.
Except we don't stop the train.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.431
There's a chance you might survive,
although unlikely.

37:17.560 --> 37:21.394
-Mr. Rosenbluth, just let me explain.
-No, no. No need!

37:21.520 --> 37:24.193
You took initiative. I respect that.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.675
But I'm a law-abiding man. Toss him.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.073
-Wait!
-On three.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.758
No, wait! No, no, no!

37:31.360 --> 37:34.352
- One. Two.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

37:34.480 --> 37:35.799
Three!

37:41.520 --> 37:44.239
The only reason you're not a permanent
part of this landscape right now

37:44.360 --> 37:46.749
is because you probably saved
my Marlena from injury,

37:46.880 --> 37:49.269
and you solved a great problem for me.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.437
You saw what we fed the cats.
It wasn't right, was it?

37:53.480 --> 37:54.879
But now because of you,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.639
Silver Star will make sure
the cats will eat good fresh meat

37:57.760 --> 37:59.193
until we can sell some tickets.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.673
But you killed my star act,

38:00.800 --> 38:03.189
so if we don't sell the tickets
and the men aren't paid,

38:03.320 --> 38:06.278
they're going to be looking
for someone to blame.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.356
Welcome to the circus, Cornell.

38:16.760 --> 38:19.513
We had to cancel shows
in three towns.

38:19.640 --> 38:24.350
The rumor was, four men got tossed
to save money. And we might go belly up.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.391
Dead circuses were common in '31.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.511
Men tired of being mistreated
would mutiny,

38:28.640 --> 38:31.393
or bosses would see the end coming
and pull a runner with all the money,

38:31.520 --> 38:35.274
leaving a mess of animals and acts
like bones to be picked over.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.680
Luckily, we found one in Goshen.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.473
And August could get any act for a song.

38:41.600 --> 38:45.309
The rest of them knew
they'd never work another show again.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.558
When I saw their faces,
I thought to myself, August was right.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.750
I'd never seen men hungry.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.553
Darling! One second, please.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.035
Erwin, over here. Joe, pour the champagne.

39:01.440 --> 39:05.274
I want you all to experience
the earthquake impact

39:05.400 --> 39:06.628
of what I'm about to show you.

39:06.760 --> 39:10.833
I've made an acquisition that will make
Benzini Brothers a top-drawer tour.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.712
-Darling.
-Yes.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.159
I know I could never truly replace
Silver Star for you,

39:18.280 --> 39:20.032
but I hope you'll give me a chance to try.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.878
Oh, August, you didn't need to do that.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.194
Joe, the doors?

39:24.640 --> 39:26.915
Children, meet our salvation!

39:27.040 --> 39:32.034
We got ourselves a guaranteed
sell-out, crowd-cheering bull!

39:32.160 --> 39:35.470
Her name is Rosie,
she's 53, and she's brilliant.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.238
What's that in her mouth?

39:37.360 --> 39:39.715
She ran off.
They found her eating a cemetery plot.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.389
I'm going to come up with a whole new
star act around you and her.

39:43.520 --> 39:47.479
Darling, I'm not getting up on that.
I've never ridden an elephant in my life!

39:47.600 --> 39:50.910
You didn't know how to stand on top
of a galloping horse until I showed you.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.589
You're a fast learner.
This act will go through the roof!

39:54.720 --> 39:56.039
Where the hell
are we gonna put it?

39:56.160 --> 39:59.072
-We'll make room.
-How are we gonna pay for it?

39:59.200 --> 40:03.273
I won't pay the men for a few weeks.
We've done it before.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.355
Once we start selling out,

40:04.480 --> 40:07.995
the men will have more cash
than they know what to do with.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.997
She's gonna pack them in. I know it!

40:14.880 --> 40:16.438
You the bull man?

40:16.560 --> 40:17.959
He's my menagerie man.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.991
You ain't got no bull man,
I gotta tell the township,

40:20.120 --> 40:22.190
or else I can't sell her to you.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.357
Well, I'm the bull man.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.711
Well, speak up! I ain't got all day.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.114
You see this animal?

40:29.240 --> 40:33.552
This here is the stupidest goddamn
animal on the face of God's good earth.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.716
Here's your bull hook.
You're going to need it.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.029
Good luck to you.

40:39.160 --> 40:43.153
If I don't ever see another dumb bull
in my life, it'll be too soon.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.389
Cornell, give her a once-over.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.478
Darling, get acquainted.
You two are gonna make history.

40:57.600 --> 41:01.752
Robinson? Come on.
Let's pick a car we can renovate.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.919
I think he's lost his mind.

41:09.040 --> 41:12.589
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to break in a new act?

41:17.200 --> 41:19.919
My name is Jacob Jankowski.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.678
-How do you do?
-And this is...

41:24.120 --> 41:25.758
Marlena Rosenbluth.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.278
You're a beauty.

41:29.440 --> 41:32.477
Your skin's a little dry.
Maybe you should take care of that.

41:32.600 --> 41:36.388
The first thing you notice
about a woman's age is her skin.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.516
Oh, great. Just what we need
around here, another lush.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.197
Well, you're welcome.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.830
Is this the way elephants flirt?

41:55.960 --> 41:58.235
Would you two like to be alone?

42:09.400 --> 42:11.436
I think she likes music.

42:13.720 --> 42:15.790
It is a lovely song.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.233
I'm confessing that I love you.

42:21.680 --> 42:22.669
Hmm?

42:25.240 --> 42:27.674
Uh, it's the name of the song.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.870
Oh, right, of course.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.115
Louis Armstrong.

42:32.440 --> 42:36.479
Well, I guess now's as good a time
as any, right, bull man?

42:36.600 --> 42:39.717
Let's get up there!
It's sink or swim around here.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.195
Can you help me with this ladder?

42:44.520 --> 42:46.909
August once dropped me
in the middle of this monkey act.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.031
The meanest monkeys you've ever met.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.957
They were biting me
during the entire performance,

42:51.080 --> 42:54.834
and I had to just smile
and act like it was part of the act.

42:55.080 --> 42:56.877
Oh, gosh.

42:58.520 --> 42:59.635
Good grief.

43:01.640 --> 43:05.792
Well, I think it's very important
to form an offstage relationship.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.352
How do I look? Silly, right?

43:09.480 --> 43:12.631
No. You two were made for each other.

43:16.520 --> 43:18.351
She really is beautiful.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.110
-Come in!

44:01.120 --> 44:02.633
Oh, Jacob.

44:02.760 --> 44:06.548
So glad you could come
and celebrate our new beautiful elephant.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.119
Is something wrong?

44:10.240 --> 44:12.674
I feel a little underdressed.

44:12.800 --> 44:15.030
Nonsense. I told you,

44:15.160 --> 44:18.948
nothing but the best
for our very own Cornell graduate vet.

44:19.080 --> 44:23.198
Which, I might add, those Ringling bastards
do not have. I checked.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.155
Voilà.

44:27.200 --> 44:31.318
I thought you could use some new threads
and a shave.

44:31.440 --> 44:34.955
Can't have my Ivy League vet
smelling like his patients.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.788
-Can you mess that up?
-Yes, of course.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.754
Perfection.

44:42.880 --> 44:46.509
When I started with Benzini,
this show was nothing but grift.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.517
A man couldn't walk
a straight line through the midway

44:48.640 --> 44:50.756
without getting his pocket picked
half a dozen times.

44:50.880 --> 44:56.193
Benzini was a cheap bastard.
He didn't invest a dime in new acts.

44:56.320 --> 45:00.199
So when he pulled a runner,
everybody thought we were belly-up.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.070
Mmm-mmm. Not me.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.191
-And you were 19, right, darling?
-Uh-huh.

45:05.320 --> 45:08.790
And August got rid of all
the pickpockets and the grift barkers,

45:08.920 --> 45:11.559
and he sold off two deadbeat clowns
and a train car

45:11.680 --> 45:14.353
so he could buy Lucinda, our lovely fat lady.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.036
-And Rex.
-Rex.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.390
But you kept the coochie girls, didn't you?

45:19.520 --> 45:21.636
No denying they're good revenue.

45:22.840 --> 45:24.478
-It's true.
-I needed money.

45:24.600 --> 45:28.991
So I had to scavenge every dead circus
for every act we have.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.714
But you didn't have to buy me, did you?

45:31.840 --> 45:32.989
No.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.714
-I had to marry you.
-That's right.

45:37.160 --> 45:39.469
-Were you a performer?
-No.

45:39.600 --> 45:41.431
August taught me everything I know.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.438
And he told me that one day
we'd be as big as Ringling Brothers.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.437
Yeah.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.438
Those damn brothers
had a stroke of genius.

45:49.560 --> 45:53.109
They sold families the idea they wanted
a show their mother and sisters could see.

45:53.240 --> 45:56.232
No sex, no grift. Safe for the kids.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.954
And nobody can touch their bookings.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.388
But we're on our way.

46:02.720 --> 46:07.396
Yeah, this bull?
This bull has got to be spectacular!

46:08.680 --> 46:12.275
I take care of the spectacle. Now
I need someone to take care of the bull.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.436
August wants you to be the bull man.

46:14.560 --> 46:17.154
You'll have full charge of training Rosie.
With a raise.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.669
Modest raise. You'll hardly notice it.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.199
I don't know anything about elephants.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.595
I'm going to tell him the truth.

46:24.880 --> 46:29.556
Some outfit will be feeding off our carcass
if we don't bring in the people.

46:29.680 --> 46:35.550
And I mean crowds falling over their feet
to get inside our big top.

46:35.680 --> 46:39.673
This bull has got to work, Jacob.
She's got to.

46:40.480 --> 46:42.596
I need to tell you something.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.829
I'm not sure you'll trust me
after you hear it.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.190
I never finished Cornell.

46:53.440 --> 46:54.395
I'm not a real vet.

46:54.800 --> 46:57.951
I didn't get my degree. I'm not licensed.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.719
Jacob,

47:06.640 --> 47:09.473
do you think Lucinda the Fat Lady
weighs 800 pounds?

47:11.320 --> 47:13.197
She's 400 at the tops.

47:13.320 --> 47:17.552
Do you think the Tattooed Woman
was tattooed by headhunters in Borneo?

47:17.680 --> 47:19.477
She's from Pittsburgh!

47:19.600 --> 47:23.718
It took her nine years to ink herself.
Tell him about the hippo, darling.

47:23.840 --> 47:27.310
When she died, we swapped out her water
for formaldehyde, kept showing her.

47:27.440 --> 47:30.193
For two weeks
we traveled with a pickled hippo!

47:30.320 --> 47:33.835
Jacob, the world's run on tricks.

47:34.200 --> 47:36.236
Everyone plays.

47:37.520 --> 47:41.638
But it's having a true talent,
a gift born within,

47:41.760 --> 47:46.038
something no degree can give you...
You have such a talent.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.277
You knew with one look about Silver Star.

47:49.880 --> 47:52.394
You must learn, my dear boy,

47:52.520 --> 47:57.799
that the rules of these United States
of Suckers do not apply to us.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.318
To talent and illusion!

48:04.480 --> 48:05.799
To Rosie.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.395
-To Rosie.
-To all we love.

48:11.040 --> 48:16.068
Tired of bein' lonely

48:16.200 --> 48:20.671
Tired of bein' blue

48:22.400 --> 48:27.520
I wished I had some good man

48:28.480 --> 48:32.758
To tell my troubles to

48:33.800 --> 48:39.033
I need a little sugar in my bowl

48:39.160 --> 48:42.516
Darling. Be gentle, darling.
We have a guest.

48:48.880 --> 48:51.474
August. August.

48:51.600 --> 48:54.876
August. You don't know
your own strength, darling.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.033
I'm right here.

48:59.440 --> 49:00.998
I'm right here.

49:03.560 --> 49:05.949
Come on, let's get you to bed.

49:07.160 --> 49:08.479
Come on.

49:09.400 --> 49:10.799
Come here.

49:11.600 --> 49:13.113
Excuse us, Jacob.

49:16.840 --> 49:18.990
Move your finger

49:19.120 --> 49:22.715
Drop something in my bowl

49:22.840 --> 49:28.631
I need a little steam-heat on my floor

49:28.760 --> 49:34.630
Maybe I can fix things up,
so they'll go

49:34.760 --> 49:36.079
Get off your knees

49:36.200 --> 49:38.794
I can't see what you're drivin' at!

49:38.920 --> 49:39.955
It's dark down there!

49:40.080 --> 49:41.229
Looks like a snake

49:41.360 --> 49:44.830
Come on here and drop somethin' here
in my bowl

49:44.960 --> 49:46.871
Stop your foolin'

49:47.000 --> 49:50.959
And drop somethin' in my bowl

49:51.080 --> 49:52.752
Is everything all right?

49:52.880 --> 49:55.872
Yes. He's just had too much to drink.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.753
Bessie Smith. Wish I could sing like that.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.876
Should I leave?

50:02.000 --> 50:03.956
No, I want to dance.

50:06.160 --> 50:09.197
Come on, just dance with me one time,
and I'll let you go home.

50:09.320 --> 50:10.719
Come on.

50:31.960 --> 50:34.076
I hope you had fun tonight.

50:35.720 --> 50:37.597
August really likes you.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.872
He could use a friend.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.233
We both could.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.912
It's a pretty song.

50:58.400 --> 51:00.550
Don't tell him what happened.

51:01.960 --> 51:05.430
No, no. I would never do that.

51:07.640 --> 51:11.428
That's the name of the song.
Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me.

51:12.880 --> 51:14.757
-The song?
-Yes.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.279
Jacob.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.513
You should go.

51:38.440 --> 51:40.237
I think you should go.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.193
All right.

51:48.440 --> 51:49.839
Good night.

52:16.680 --> 52:19.433
Brava, Queenie! Brava!

52:20.240 --> 52:25.633
This is my new friend
and roommate, Jacob!

52:28.920 --> 52:32.390
I'd like you all to make him feel at home.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.439
I'd love to make you feel at home.

53:15.680 --> 53:19.514
Oh, yeah! Come on.

53:19.640 --> 53:21.596
Nice legs, sister!

53:21.720 --> 53:23.870
Hello, beautiful!

53:26.840 --> 53:28.273
What the hell did I do last night?

53:28.400 --> 53:30.311
You threw up on Barbara.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.398
Your balls itchy?

53:37.320 --> 53:38.753
Yeah, they are.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.036
Thank you for doing that.

53:42.160 --> 53:45.072
It'll grow back. In patches.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.351
What's wrong with Queenie?

53:49.560 --> 53:50.515
What do you mean, wrong?

53:50.640 --> 53:53.359
I mean, she's not hating me.
Something's wrong.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.708
She must've eaten something.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.432
Try getting some honey
from the cookhouse,

53:56.560 --> 53:58.312
and if you can, some slippery elm powder.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.396
And if that doesn't work,

54:00.520 --> 54:03.796
we can check her for parasites tomorrow
if you want.

54:08.840 --> 54:10.751
My real name's Walter, by the way.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.439
Good morning.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.591
I forgot how big you were.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.436
All right, you want to get to work? Huh?

54:29.560 --> 54:30.913
Okay.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.195
All right, you have to
take it easy with me today.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.436
I'm not in the best form.

54:42.840 --> 54:44.319
You feel like walking?

54:44.440 --> 54:46.317
Wild party, I hear.

54:48.520 --> 54:50.590
I've forgotten most of it.

54:51.720 --> 54:54.996
Seems like the rest
of these guys haven't, though.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.077
About last night, l...

55:00.440 --> 55:02.670
It was just the champagne.

55:02.800 --> 55:03.755
What was?

55:05.200 --> 55:07.316
You're new at this, aren't you?

55:07.440 --> 55:08.509
When a woman gives it to you straight,

55:08.640 --> 55:11.598
don't give her a line
like you don't remember.

55:13.320 --> 55:14.958
All right.

55:15.080 --> 55:17.913
I meant what I said about us being friends.

55:23.640 --> 55:26.313
Where are you going?

55:27.400 --> 55:29.277
Good morning, children.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.197
-Morning, darling.
-Where were you?

55:31.320 --> 55:34.153
I woke up early to train with the girls.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.072
Clearly your charms are very effective
on a lovesick pachyderm.

55:38.200 --> 55:40.919
Too bad they were less successful
with Barbara.

55:41.040 --> 55:42.393
Barbara? I didn't...

55:42.520 --> 55:46.718
Word has it you didn't,
though you gave it the old Cornell try.

55:46.840 --> 55:49.798
-Can we get on with this, please?
-Yes, of course. Now, Cornell,

55:49.920 --> 55:54.516
when it comes to working with a bull,
charm's the last thing required.

55:55.560 --> 55:59.269
You know, any living creature needs
to know who's in charge.

55:59.400 --> 56:03.996
They can sense when a man's power is,
shall we say, in full strength,

56:04.120 --> 56:07.874
and when a man's power is, shall we say,
not.

56:08.440 --> 56:13.355
First of all, can't do anything with a bull
without a bull hook, can you?

56:22.280 --> 56:26.717
And with it, you must claim
the role of master immediately.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.035
Okay.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.389
You use it there, right above her shoulder.

56:38.600 --> 56:41.433
And you use your full voice to command.

56:45.480 --> 56:46.799
Rosie,

56:47.800 --> 56:49.028
walk!

56:49.160 --> 56:52.152
-Rosie, move, walk!
-Now jab her!

56:52.280 --> 56:54.430
She needs to know you mean it.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.235
Rosie, walk.

57:05.200 --> 57:06.997
Rosie, walk, come on.

57:09.640 --> 57:11.471
Rosie, walk!

57:11.600 --> 57:13.477
Watch me. Back off.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.679
Up.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.119
Up.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.719
Forward!

57:24.000 --> 57:25.991
Forward! Move!

57:28.720 --> 57:30.073
Up!

57:31.120 --> 57:32.792
Up! Move!

57:33.880 --> 57:35.598
Up! Move!

57:37.080 --> 57:38.433
Up!

57:39.400 --> 57:42.312
Up! Move!

59:48.400 --> 59:53.076
Ladies and gentlemen,
and children of all ages,

59:53.200 --> 59:56.795
welcome to the most
extravagant extravaganza

59:56.920 --> 59:59.150
the human eye can behold!

59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.793
Welcome the stars

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.198
of the Benzini Brothers
Most Spectacular Show on Earth!

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.388
Move up! Up!

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.556
Up! Move!

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.710
In the big top! Come on!

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.872
-You all right?
-Yeah. I just landed funny on my heel.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.150
Get that damn bull
before we're driven out of town.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.271
Don't forget the bull hook.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.711
Jacob? Some of the boys saw her
heading for town.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.990
I'll help you, kid. Come on.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.392
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.238
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.518
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.795
This yours?

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.593
Yeah, we'll take care of it, Officer.
Don't you worry. Thank you.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.675
My cabbage!
You pay for those, eh?

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.789
I'm sorry, sir.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.909
I'll get out of here in two minutes.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.792
Oh, they just love booze.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.311
One whiff of this, and she ain't thinking
about corn anymore!

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.351
Did you see that?

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.837
Got this from Wade and Grady.
Bastards been holding out on me.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.032
-Hey, mister! To pay?
-I will. I will!

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.232
Kills me,
wasting it on a goddamn pachyderm.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.270
Oh! This damn leg of mine.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.156
Is she following?

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.316
- Yeah, she's following.
-Uh-huh. Good.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.318
Evening.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.509
-You okay?
-I'm fine. I have a sore wrist.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.835
A bruised heel. I'll be fine.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.151
But I think August could use a drink.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.273
Maybe you should take him out, Jacob.
Get him to relax a bit.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.436
Did you catch that bull?

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.599
Yeah, I got her back in her car eventually.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.709
Good.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.793
August?

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.273
August!

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.391
August! Don't!

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.239
-August! August!
-Stop!

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.193
August! She was good! She was good.
She came back on her own.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.029
She just needs more time.
She wasn't ready yet. Hey!

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.308
Stop it!

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.715
Stay down, kid. I mean it!

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.149
We need to get a lot of whiskey.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.278
I don't understand why a man like that

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.834
wants to be around animals
in the first place.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.713
He shouldn't have the right if you ask me.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.234
Marlena!

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.278
Did Marlena send you?

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.589
No.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.036
She doesn't want to see me.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.632
She won't talk to me.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.829
She won't forgive me this time.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.030
Maybe you can talk to her.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.792
I know there is no excuse for what I did.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.593
-ls she all right, Rosie?
-She could use some whiskey.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.598
Yeah, yeah. Here, take all I've got.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.633
Take it.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.591
Will you tell her? Marlena?

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.389
Tell her what?

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.355
I saw the bull rear up and run away
with her, and I lost my mind.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.755
That's no excuse. I know that.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.753
I've spent all that money on that bull.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:13.438
I need to pay the workmen.
I have debts to pay.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.074
I need to sell tickets.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.831
And that bull is useless.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.111
If I lose Marlena, you understand,
I'll lose all of this.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.077
What were you planning on doing
with that bull hook?

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.075
Jacob?

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.238
Are you sure that's not too much?
She might get drunk.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.234
She weighs four tons. She just gets sleepy.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.191
She can barely move as it is.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.799
She'll be fine.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.349
I don't know what to do, Camel.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:17.595
He'll kill her next time.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.917
There's nothing you can do.
A man like that.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.997
He throws men off a moving train
so he don't have to pay.

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:28.598
You think he thinks twice about
killing one of God's innocent creatures?

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.309
-Can you pass me the other rag?
-Mmm?

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:36.350
-It's under your foot.
-Oh...

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.675
Lift your leg. Lift your leg.

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:55.069
I want you to read these out loud to Rosie.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.795
Might help if he said "please."

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.553
Say...

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.554
-What does that mean?
-Just try it.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.238
Now the next one.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.229
The only really authentic miracle
is success.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.716
Washes away all sins.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.429
Don't you think? Just the thought of it
makes all things right.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.912
Anyway, to Rosie,

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.635
our big, fat, beautiful

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.115
bull's-eye of a star attraction.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.954
-I need to get some more champagne.
-Let me get it.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.838
No. Sit! My party.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.235
It's good seeing him like this.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.190
Looks like it's gonna be
standing room only from now on.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.869
You know how many star acts
we've had that packed them in?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.755
How much money we've made and lost,
and made and lost?

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.798
Silver Star paid for our new stateroom,
and look what happened to him.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.994
Why do you stay with him?

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.031
I was born a passenger.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.830
They found me wrapped in a newspaper
under a seat on the Baltimore and Ohio.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.155
I was just three days old.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.157
I grew up in foster homes.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.794
I'd always daydream
about who my parents were.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.229
When I was five, for an entire year,

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.669
I pretended my mom
was an Appaloosa mare.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.119
I did.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.871
And that I was a filly,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.992
and that I was just dreaming
that I was a girl.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.116
And that one day I'd wake up,
and I'd run home.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.076
One thing was for sure,
I was a lot safer in those stables

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.430
than I ever was in those homes.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.030
And then the circus came to town.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.948
And there they were,
these six gorgeous black Friesians

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.753
with red tassels
hanging down their manes.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.030
So beautiful.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.151
And August was right out front.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:09.035
And as soon as he looked at me,
I knew I'd never live with strangers again.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.155
So we got married.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.998
And where did I end up?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.271
Living on a train.
It's the only real home I've ever known.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.354
And you know, I'm a star attraction.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.156
Out there,

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.068
I got nothing just like everybody else.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.749
You're a beautiful woman.
You deserve a beautiful life.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.552
That's all there is to it.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.270
Where were you when I was 17, huh?

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.869
Let's dance.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.035
--This is a raid!

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.189
Raid!

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.715
Marlena! Marlena!

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.395
Jacob!

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.238
Hey! Hold it right there!

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.598
This way!

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.194
-You all right?
-That was really close.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.436
I ripped my stockings.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.630
They were silk, too.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.193
Who cares?

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.636
I don't know how we're going to find
our way back,

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.115
especially if we don't find August.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.753
We should probably go look for him, right?

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.958
Don't follow me.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.634
I told myself, let her go.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.354
She'll tell August
that I got lost in the crowd.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:36.799
It's the best thing for her.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.275
It's the best thing for everybody.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.674
I just couldn't do it.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.631
Rosie...

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.957
I convinced myself
I had to stay to protect Rosie.

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.038
To protect Marlena.
Because August couldn't be trusted.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.510
When the truth was

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.473
maybe I was the man
who couldn't be trusted.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.715
Hey. Hey.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.956
Something's wrong with Camel. Come on.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.435
Hey, kid. How nice to see you.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.879
Hey, Camel.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.390
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:25.274
I woke up this morning,
and my feet was all floppy.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.709
I just can't feel them right.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.471
And it's not just that, though.
There's other stuff, too.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.116
-Like down there? Man stuff?
-Yeah.

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.355
What's wrong with him, Doc?

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.233
It's jake leg. I've seen it before.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.396
No such thing, is there, Doc?

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.989
Manufacturer started putting
this plasticizer in this

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.553
to get around regulations that

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.797
Jamaican ginger extract
not be sold as booze.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.956
You're not supposed to drink this stuff,
you know?

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.516
What the hell am I supposed to drink
to stop the shakes?

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.957
It's Prohibition.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.798
I ain't no Astor.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.356
It's okay, Camel. Tomorrow's payday.
We'll get you some moonshine.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.471
Don't lie to the man.
If we were getting paid,

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.636
Blackie wouldn't have red-lighted
nine men.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.637
That can't be true.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.991
Nine men disappear
between Goshen and Weehawken?

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.236
And we didn't make no stops.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.278
Is he gonna get better?

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.073
Earl or Blackie
see Camel like this, it's over.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.679
We need to get him out of sight, Jacob.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.759
All right.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.635
Jacob, in a week, he's not gonna be able
to move his legs at all.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.719
Listen. He told me he has a son in Reading.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.516
We play there in three weeks.
Three weeks. That's all he needs.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.200
Blackie and his men
don't patrol performer cars.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.149
-Good morning.
-Hey.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.393
-Do you mind if I sit?
-Not at all.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.514
Can we speak privately later?

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.518
Why? Is something the matter?

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.518
I just wanted to apologize
about what happened last night.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.837
That's silly, Jacob.
Why would you apologize?

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.791
You weren't even there.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.436
I explained to August what happened
as best I could remember it.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.518
Champagne just overwhelms my senses.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.598
I remember there was a crowd,
and people were pushing.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.157
And I was running,
and I fell and tore my stockings.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.269
Morning, children!

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.833
That was quite an adventure
we had last night.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.356
Thanks, Pauley.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.553
Glad I didn't have to bail you
out of jail. How'd you get home?

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.036
-I took the ferry.
-Brilliant and cheap.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.479
Good man.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.795
I slept like a baby after last night.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.991
-Thank you, my darling!
-August, please, we're in public.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.599
What? Nothing to be ashamed of.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.995
Man and wife reuniting
in their marriage bed?

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.752
It's a sacred act.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.360
My Marlena has forgiven me.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.789
All's well with the world again.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.436
Now, in a circle.

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.318
Beautiful, Jacob.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.395
You know, I was really worried
about you two last night.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.074
If anything had happened to Marlena,

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:14.799
if anyone had harmed her
or as much as touched her,

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.958
I hate to think of it.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.036
Now let's bring her back in.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.389
If August knew anything
about that night, you'd never know it.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:36.080
All he seemed to care about was Rosie,

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.237
and God love her,
she played her part to a T.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.271
We all did.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:46.315
Everything went back to how it was before.
At least, that's how it looked.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.672
But nothing was the same.
August was right again.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.631
Everything is an illusion.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.232
Come on!

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.677
With straw house sell-outs,

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.912
August promised the men
he'd finally pay them with increases,

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.235
once his debts were covered.

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.477
Success had made a new man
out of August, they all said.

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.428
But I watched him,
and I knew it was just a matter of time.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.398
Shh! Children.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:17.436
The circus is nothing without its traditions.
It's a family.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:20.472
And like any family,
when a new member is born,

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:24.878
its arrival has to be greeted
with celebration and with gratitude.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.877
Now I know we've all been
kind of busy lately

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.753
with sold-out performances.
Thank the gods!

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.355
Shh!

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:38.198
But right now, I want to take
this moment before today's show

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.311
to gather together.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.158
We close our eyes

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.229
and we thank

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.194
whoever's up there that sends
desperate men running for the rails.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.911
Because it was a lucky day
when Jacob Jankowski jumped our train.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:03.510
It is because of his discovery
that we have the greatest star attraction

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.871
in the Benzini Brothers' history!

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.431
Shh! And so,

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:17.792
to officially welcome him into our family,

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.672
we open our eyes,

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.952
and we give him the traditional
Benzini Brothers baptism!

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.237
Congratulations, Jacob.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.198
Will you bring Rosie
to my tent after this?

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.356
And don't tell anyone, okay?

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.831
Where do you want her?

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.871
Oh, if you could stake her right there,
that would be great.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.355
I'm planning a little surprise for August.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.914
I've never seen the company
so happy before.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.669
Maybe we will give Ringling Brothers
a run for their money.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.830
Do you need anything else?

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.552
No, thank you.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.355
Um, actually...

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.635
-Thank you.
-Sorry.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.712
So, what's this?

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.991
Oh, this is for you. Surprise!
Congratulations, darling.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.315
Thank you, my darling.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.032
Jacob, where are you going?

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.829
It's your thing.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.791
No, please join us. Come.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.158
-Marlena.
-Of course.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.031
To August, a genuine miracle man
for making a star attraction out of me.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.433
Many thanks.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.474
Many thanks to both of you.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.437
And forgive me for arriving too soon
and spoiling the surprise.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.391
I could go back out.

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.999
Give you more time.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.238
Or better yet, I could yell "Raid! "
and clear the place out.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.876
In fact, it gave me an idea for the show.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.274
A new act.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.992
This is the story.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.032
A first dance. Two characters.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:56.077
A young awkward man, hopelessly in love
with a woman beyond his reach,

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.236
who teases his affections.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.309
Hmm?

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:06.711
We start with a romantic melody
that sweeps them onto the dance floor.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.513
He wraps his arms around her.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.719
He wraps his arms around her.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.831
Come on. Please, indulge me. I'm inspired.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.518
The audience will love it!

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.233
Yes.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.553
Now, they look into each other's eyes.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.749
-August...
-Look at him!

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.432
She touches his cheek.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.717
And gently runs her hand down his neck,

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.479
playing with his hair.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:54.431
Never leaving his eyes.
Never leaving his eyes.

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.873
Making him believe she's his.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.195
He slides his hand lower

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.033
and lower, below her waist.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:12.631
But she slaps his wrist

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.389
as if to protect her honor
against this rude Lothario.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.269
That's it!

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.516
The audience will eat it up.
They love the illusion.

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.835
They'll never guess
you have no honor to protect.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.633
August. Please.

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.712
It's funny how things pan out.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.832
I've always known
the kind of woman you really are.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.394
Sitting in front of your dress shop,

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.556
watching the parade.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.313
Those little-girl-lost eyes.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.754
This beautiful, almost translucent skin.
Well, translucent to me.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.838
I could always see straight through you.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.270
I'm sorry to say that you're really
a very common type, darling.

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.078
Marlena, we should go.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.792
Is that the plan?

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.190
-You're leaving me for him?
-No.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.675
-You must be special. No?
-August, please.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.917
If he doesn't mean anything to you,
tell me to fire him.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:10.635
Fire him.

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.273
Tell me to unleash Blackie and his men

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.152
to teach him a lesson
not to touch my things.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.669
Marlena. Marlena, it's all right.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.033
Jacob, just go.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.674
Ooh. Dissention in the ranks!

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.519
Betrayal trumps lust!

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.631
That's what sells tickets, kids!

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.752
August, look at me. Look.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.273
I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here.

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.915
-Do you want to leave me?
-No.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.957
But I'm your wife.
I'm not one of your things.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.433
Prove it.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.717
Look at me!

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.310
Nothing is going on. Nothing.
Do you hear me?

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.112
I'll never leave you.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.194
Of course, an innocent woman
wouldn't have to get on her knees.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.997
But you can't help it, can you?

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.237
Just force of habit for a woman like you.

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.078
Boss!

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.553
The rubes.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.036
Walk away now,

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.391
or this will get a lot worse a lot faster!

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.715
I got him! Okay? I got him.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.792
The only thing keeping you alive
right now are those rubes.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.909
August hates witnesses.

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.190
Oh, jeez, kid, what did you do?

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.436
I'm not leaving her with him.

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.158
- Get in! Shut the door!
-I have to find her!

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.713
You go after her,
and August can have you shot,

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.114
and nobody can stop him.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.470
Look, you just got fired.
Makes you a trespasser.

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.313
Jacob.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.153
Are you all right?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.797
The girls overheard August
giving Blackie the order.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.070
They're coming after you
as soon as we start to move.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.839
You have to get off this train right now.

01:31:58.840 --> 01:31:59.829
Go.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.190
If we don't get too far,
there's a hotel in Salem.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.550
-But don't stay longer than the night.
-Just come with me.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.593
What?

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.392
You think there's nothing out there for you,
but there is.

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.954
You just can't see it.

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.674
Jacob, you don't understand. I can't.
He'll find me.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.998
Marlena, there's a better kind of life
that's meant for you.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.636
Whether that life is with me or not,
or whether you love me or not,

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.398
it doesn't matter.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.879
But it's got to be now.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:35.113
How long have I been asleep?

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.595
We can't stay here, Jacob.
We have to keep moving.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.429
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get the first bus out of here.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:45.235
We'll make our way to Ithaca.
I'll call my dean, take my finals.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.318
We do whatever job we can
until my license comes in,

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.192
and then we go to Ringling.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.550
Ringling's a tough act to break into.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.194
-You can't just walk through the door.
-No, no, no.

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.993
Not if we offer ourselves as a team.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.997
You as a performer, me as a vet.
That's a pretty sweet deal, right?

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.553
You think they'll take it?

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.870
No! No! No!

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.558
Someone's coming.

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.757
- Easy, up.
- Come on.

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.313
Mind yourself.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.158
Get that branch.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:14.033
Get back on. Come on. We're losing time.

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.513
Come on.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.679
Walter.

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.433
Camel?

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.399
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.910
Step this way! Just follow the sound
of my voice! Don't be shy!

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.508
Plenty of time before the big show
starts in the big top!

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:02.152
Jacob. It's okay. I don't have much time.

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.874
Where's Walter?
Where's Walter and Camel?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.673
When we jumped the train last night,
August went crazy.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.791
He had Blackie red-lighting men all night.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:13.993
Wade and Grady hit soft ground,
and they found Walter and Camel.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.997
They had hit the rocks.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:18.795
They didn't make it.

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.397
Wade and Grady
are gonna take August down.

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:27.193
I don't know how,
but you have to get out of here.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.232
I'll stay hidden until the matinee starts.

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.352
Then I'll make my way to town.
There's got to be a church or something.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.596
There is.

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.998
You do the Spec, but when the show starts,
come and meet me.

01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:42.236
August won't know you're gone
until the second act.

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.396
-So we'll get a head start.
-I have to go.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.432
Marlena, just promise me you'll come.

01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.359
Or I'll come back for you. I swear it.

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.193
I'll be there.

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:01.715
I love you.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:05.196
Ladies and gentlemen,
and children of all ages,

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.595
welcome the stars

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.669
of the Benzini Brothers
Most Spectacular Show on Earth!

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:02.515
Something's wrong.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.915
Everybody to the big top!
Come on.

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.558
ROUSTABOUT 3:. Where's it coming from?

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.112
Barbara, take Queenie!

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.279
ROUSTABOUT 4:. The cats are loose!

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.959
Get them!

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.599
Daddy!

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.753
Move! Move! No!

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.075
Marlena!

01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:09.633
Marlena!

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.515
Marlena!

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.239
Marlena!

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:18.949
Rosie...

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:27.309
Rosie!

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.752
The official report said
August had been trampled to death.

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.839
Blackie was never seen again after Wade
and Grady dragged him out of that tent.

01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.838
And no one was charged with
letting the animals out of those cages.

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:34.633
To the police, it could have been anyone.

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.391
Benzini Brothers was officially belly up,
property of Altoona, Pennsylvania.

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.590
Shows on the road would get the scent
soon enough

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.950
and come to pick off our bones.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.196
I wouldn't leave Rosie to that.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.710
I wasn't gonna let anybody touch her
with that hook again.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:01.434
So like I planned, I took my finals.

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.472
And with my degree,
our animals, and Marlena 's act,

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.431
Ringling got themselves a sweet deal.

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.913
A sweet deal.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.276
Our first son was born that season. Walter.

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.436
He spent the first seven years
of his life with Ringling.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.915
That's why I cannot

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.919
understand how he could forget
to show up today.

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.791
There was a circus in town!

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.596
By the time our third son came,
we'd had enough. Rosie was tired.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:34.430
Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo
dropped dead, so I got the job.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.314
We bought some property
so we could keep the horses, Rosie,

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.715
and then five kids.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:44.596
Oh, before you know it, the kids
are borrowing the car and moving out.

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:48.872
So then it was just Rosie and us.

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.956
When Rosie passed on,

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.879
Marlena cried for days.

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:02.155
We owed Rosie our whole lives.

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.992
And Marlena?

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.630
My Marlena died in her bed.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:15.917
Still beautiful, though.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.434
We had a lot of years, though.

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.792
I don't know how I did it, but I managed
to give her everything I promised.

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:35.718
And, boy, that was the life!

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:38.553
Boy, I'm telling you!

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.358
Are you hiring me?

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:50.109
I don't know. What about your health?

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:53.437
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm just old.

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.790
Work is the best thing for age.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:58.480
A man like me
ought to be working the ticket wicket,

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.229
not some kid ringed up like a sideshow act.

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.512
And if you don't think I'm carrying
my weight, you can call the home.

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.232
I won't argue.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.358
You won't be sorry.

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.793
Yeah, we'll get you in the record books.

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:16.876
"Oldest man that ever ran away
with the circus."

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:21.357
I'm not running away.

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.038
I'm coming home.

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:28.475
