00:13.181 --> 00:14.215
What do we have on the vic?

00:15.383 --> 00:17.318
Daniel Jameson, mid-50's, a
partner at the Ombello Group.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.220
"Ombello?"
Is that Latin for bullshit?

00:19.487 --> 00:21.189
He had an apartment
in the city.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.191
And before you ask,
I don't know where it is.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.193
Why don't you try to find
Jameson's apartment?

00:25.226 --> 00:28.629
Have you heard of a detective
by the name of Casey Oaks?

00:28.862 --> 00:31.099
ETHAN: If I can figure out
who else is paying

00:31.132 --> 00:32.766
and why that gives
me leverage...

00:33.501 --> 00:35.103
Maybe I can get out
from under him.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.506
Casey Oaks. What the fuck?
Look at this.

00:38.772 --> 00:39.940
That's Oaks.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.343
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to prove a cop is dirty?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.378
He said he loved sittin'
in the bleachers

00:44.412 --> 00:45.746
in old Candlestick
with his buddies.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.149
So maybe my guy was headed
for San Francisco.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.418
I think I've got a live one
on Drubeskaya.

00:50.451 --> 00:53.121
A double homicide
at a gas station off the I-70.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.156
What about this
poor schmuck's vehicle?

00:55.189 --> 00:57.125
He reset his GPS
for San Francisco.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

01:51.579 --> 01:52.813
Helena Peabody.

01:52.846 --> 01:53.847
Seriously?

01:54.682 --> 01:55.683
She was your favorite?

01:55.716 --> 01:56.750
That bitch ruined
Bette's life.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.818
Oh, bullshit!

01:57.851 --> 01:59.287
She came between
Bette and Tina,

01:59.320 --> 02:00.688
she fucked up
a beautiful thing.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.823
Tina knew exactly
what she was doing.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.492
She's the one who strayed!

02:05.193 --> 02:07.228
-Yeah, but...
-Plus Tina was into dick, man!

02:07.261 --> 02:08.629
That shit don't fly.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.831
Helena saw what she wanted
and she went after it.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.434
And she didn't give a fuck
about the consequences.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.603
Helena is all woman.
She's...

02:19.207 --> 02:20.441
She's what?

02:32.953 --> 02:34.222
Hello, Sadie.

02:34.788 --> 02:35.889

to see you too.

I missed you.

You got some balls,
you know that?

02:46.534 --> 02:47.901
Look, things got
outta hand, okay?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.237
You think?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.604
It wasn't easy for me either.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.872
-I had...
-You had?

02:52.373 --> 02:54.342
Really?
I had prison.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.543
Whatever you had,
you didn't have that.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.910
I'm sorry.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.746
It's a little too fucking
late for that.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.515
Is it?

03:16.664 --> 03:17.731
You find everything you need?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.501
Yeah, so far, so good.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.737
-You screwed up bad, huh?
-Excuse me.

-Got anything to drink?
-You're not staying.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.526
It's all there.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.593
Most of it.

-My diamond earrings?
-Hocked them.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.267
-Bills.
-My bracelet?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.603
Gave it to some chick
I met at Dinah Shore.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.005
She was real fucking good.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.043
One drink.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.512
Then I'll go.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.942
I thought about this a lot.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.613
Every night,
lying in my cell.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.884

I ever saw you again?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.001
But...

05:34.668 --> 05:35.736
I'm here now.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.539
In your kitchen.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.110
So you say or do...

05:45.413 --> 05:47.448
Whatever it is you think
you need to say.

05:48.816 --> 05:49.817
Or do.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.626
I guess I deserved that.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.133
MONTY: 9:30.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.602
I should have been a tailor.

And you should have the back
that goes with it.

for Mr. Fishbein, please.

the earth will stop spinning

06:51.011 --> 06:52.045
and you'll order number two.

my old man leaves the house,

06:58.051 --> 07:00.053
and takes the T train
to the shop.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.955
And then one day,
he decides he wants

07:01.989 --> 07:03.457
an oat bran muffin from Ida's.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.726
So for the first time
in his life,

07:06.259 --> 07:07.861
he gets off the train at 24th.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.998
He figures he'll have a muffin
and a cup of coffee

07:11.832 --> 07:13.166
and walk to the shop
from there.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.874
-Is that the end of the story?
-For my father, it was.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.478
Two months later he drops dead
in his tracks,

07:24.512 --> 07:25.646
just like that.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.147
And you blame the muffin?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.583
All I know is that he changed
the routine.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.119
And once you change
the routine,

07:32.753 --> 07:34.655
you change every step
that comes after.

07:35.255 --> 07:38.191
Routine, my friend.

secrets from me now.

-No shit.

cup of coffee.

with a dirty cop.

on the force,

08:12.960 --> 08:13.961
I understand plenty.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.729
No good can come
of this for you.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.064
If you're right, you're a rat.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.799

no one's gonna say,

08:18.832 --> 08:20.834

gonna go on for?

13:31.344 --> 13:32.412
Spit it out.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.315
I want you to sit on a house.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.850
Thank God!

13:36.884 --> 13:38.151
I thought you were
going to ask me to watch

13:38.185 --> 13:39.219
your fucking dog.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.854
Who's house?

13:40.888 --> 13:41.922
Casey Oaks.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.158
-The cop?
-Yes.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.160
Shit!

13:47.895 --> 13:48.996
Can't I just keep
Rover company?

13:49.029 --> 13:50.397
Okay. Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.831
I was kidding.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.266
All right, all you gotta
do is call me

13:53.300 --> 13:55.435
if you see something
that doesn't look right. Okay?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.539
You know this could
be both our asses?

13:59.572 --> 14:01.942
I know. I wouldn't ask
if it weren't important.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.576
It's probably nothing.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.512
Yeah, I said I'll do it.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.047
Let's go get that shrimp.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.525
What can I do for you,
Counselor?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.327
I'd like to see these files.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.995
I could get them myself if...

14:22.029 --> 14:24.197
You could if you
carried a badge.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.199
Just trying to save you
a trip.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.368
This won't take a minute.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.340
Hmm.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.208
Is there a problem?

14:36.243 --> 14:37.945
Only for the guy at the wrong
end of these files.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.213
Someone else was asking
for them last night.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.449
-They're checked out.
-Can I ask who?

14:43.483 --> 14:44.952
Well, you could ask me
anything you want.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.555
Just bustin' balls, Counselor.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.991
It was Clea Annou
from Southern Division.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.559
Thanks.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.068
Joan, can you get me
Captain Sleader?

15:01.101 --> 15:02.902
-JOAN: At Central, right?
-Southern.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.243
JOAN: He's on two.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.348
Hey, how are you doing, Frank?

15:16.383 --> 15:17.217
I'm good.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.321
So, one of your detectives,
Clea Annou...

15:22.689 --> 15:24.157
No, I'm sure it's nothing.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.161
It's just that we're running
a sting out in Bayview,

15:28.195 --> 15:30.930
Thomas Avenue, and one of my
guys spotted her in the area.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.169
I just don't want my guys
stepping on your guy's toes

15:36.369 --> 15:37.404
and vice versa.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.441
The Jameson homicide?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.377
Uh-huh.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.613
No, we're good.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.949
All right, thanks a lot.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.562
(KNOCKING)

16:14.407 --> 16:15.675
Hey, come on in.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.614
This isn't wet or anything,
is it?

16:22.049 --> 16:23.083
No.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.287
I went to pull files on Oaks'
cases that either ended

16:27.554 --> 16:29.122
before trial or
without a conviction.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.391
In the last three years,
there were five.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.593
The thing is, they were all
pulled by another cop,

16:34.094 --> 16:35.195
Clea Annou.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.997
-Maybe she's covering for him.
-Or she's looking into him.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.233
I can't approach her
without setting off alarms

16:40.267 --> 16:41.334
so you're going
to have to do it.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.735
Of course.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.405
Look, Ethan, this whole thing
goes nowhere

16:45.438 --> 16:48.175
unless we get someone inside
the Department on our side.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.076
Right.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.577
You start making allegations
against Oaks,

16:50.610 --> 16:52.479
even with evidence
to support it,

16:52.512 --> 16:54.347
you have no idea how thick
that blue line is.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.016
They arrest you on some
trumped-up charge,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.752
you resist, they restrain you,
back of a police van,

16:59.786 --> 17:00.820
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.055
You know how it goes.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.556
Yeah, I know how it goes.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.126
Then help me build
a case so watertight,

17:06.159 --> 17:07.527
so slam-fucking-dunkable,

17:07.560 --> 17:09.362
then maybe, maybe you have
a chance of getting out

17:09.396 --> 17:10.430
from under this guy.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.699
-And maybe you make DA.
-Maybe.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.168
But we can't do this
without help.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.504
All right, what do you
need from me?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.572
First.
Stay close to Oaks.

17:19.606 --> 17:23.076
Second, this is Clea Annou's
personnel file.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.612
It's all I could get without
making people curious.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.380
Figure out which side
of the line she's on.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.583
If he does anything else,
I'm the first to know.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.651
Absolutely.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.087
Hmm.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.695
Hey.
Brought you coffee.

18:16.796 --> 18:17.797
Thank you.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.200
Whose kids?

18:22.169 --> 18:23.170
Oh, it's nothing.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.104
Just unfinished business.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.540
Is this to do with
Ethan Kelly?

18:28.775 --> 18:29.842
Yes.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.678
Let me take a look.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.619
What's their connection
to Kelly?

18:44.191 --> 18:45.358
Why don't we go for a drive.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.733
I had just lectured you.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.702
Lectured me? Wow!

18:55.735 --> 18:59.172
Did we suddenly step into some
sort of 1950's time warp?

18:59.206 --> 19:01.308
The brooding husband
and the sad, diminutive wife.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.909
No. Because there's
no era in which

19:02.942 --> 19:04.344
I'd ever be married to you.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.912
You're just pissed because
I cracked the perp.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.146
I'm pissed because I am
running point

19:07.347 --> 19:08.581
and you came in half-cocked.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.749
I just wanted to be home
by dinner.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.053
Something funny?

19:14.487 --> 19:17.457
No, you remind me of me
and my partner.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.759
Patrick Finnegan.
Chicago PD.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.294
Davis.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.664
It's about all I can do
to not murder her.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.065
I'm here on behalf

19:26.098 --> 19:27.567
of the Federal Task Force
Investigation.

19:27.834 --> 19:28.835
Yeah, what case?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.470
The murder of a
Federal Officer.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.306
Shit. How can we help?

19:33.706 --> 19:34.907
Ethan Kelly.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.175
He's a POI.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.677
Recently relocated
back here.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.213
Used to own a security firm
on Mason Street.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.882
I can't seem to find
a current address.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.517
I was hoping to borrow
one of your computers.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.420
Shouldn't be a problem.
Can I see your badge?

19:47.654 --> 19:48.855
-Oh, yeah.
-I just have to check

19:48.888 --> 19:49.922
with the Captain.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.758
Ah, well...

20:16.916 --> 20:17.950
We good?

20:17.984 --> 20:19.352
You have a call on line one.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.521
Sorry about your partner.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.294
(SIGHS)

20:33.800 --> 20:35.868
You sold me out to SFPD?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.304
You're on thin ice, Finnegan.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.739
No disrespect,
but I don't give a shit.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.007
What the hell are
you doing there?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.343
Anna is in San Francisco.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.612
The GPS of the driver
she killed...

20:45.645 --> 20:47.347
You have no proof
that was her.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.948
They found her DNA
on the molar they pulled

20:48.981 --> 20:50.016
from the burn pit.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.351
PATRICK: Of course they did.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.586
Trust me, she's after
Ethan Kelly.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.021
AGENT: And you know this how?

20:55.054 --> 20:57.390
No way. Let me guess,
this has something to do

20:57.424 --> 20:59.392
with the fact that you just
knew Anna Drubeskya

20:59.426 --> 21:00.860
was gonna be behind
the Royal Hotel that night?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.296
She's coming for Kelly.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.531
So what are you gonna do?
Sit on him?

21:04.864 --> 21:07.066
Sooner or later,
she is gonna show.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.335
AGENT: What then?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.404
You have zero jurisdiction
and you're off the case.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.011
Look, Patrick, I want Anna
caught as badly as you do.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.013
Believe me.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.750
Harper was a good agent.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.984
She was a pain in the ass,

21:25.017 --> 21:26.686
which is why if Anna bought
either of us

21:26.719 --> 21:27.687
a one-way ticket
to the morgue,

21:27.720 --> 21:29.356
you better believe Deakins
would be chasing down

21:29.389 --> 21:31.324
every single lead no matter
how small.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.459
AGENT: You have
nothing to go on.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.027
Patrick, you gotta
give me something.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.997
Anything, something that
proves that she's there,

21:38.030 --> 21:39.499
and I will run it
up the chain,

21:39.532 --> 21:40.833
I will get it to the bosses,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.602
I will get resources
put behind you.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.473
But if not, you gotta
bring your ass home.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.943
I'm due paid leave.
Consider this my notice.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.780
No, Patrick.
Finnegan!

21:55.482 --> 21:57.316
-Fuck.
-(SLAMS PHONE)

22:12.499 --> 22:13.500
Mind if I bum one?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.748
Thanks.

22:29.649 --> 22:30.583
Sorry, man.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.552
-If it were up to me...
-It's not your fault.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.789
So, your partner was
a fireball too, huh?

22:37.824 --> 22:38.891
Relentless.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.395
One of those
Jack Russell dogs.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.531
Size of a fuckin'
loaf of bread,

22:44.564 --> 22:45.965
go toe-to-toe with
a mountain lion.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.001
She didn't give a shit.

22:52.739 --> 22:53.773
Saved my life.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.810
I was beaten
six ways to Sunday,

22:57.844 --> 22:59.546
and left for dead
out in the country.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.848
Everybody wrote me off.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.551
And I should've been dead.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.787
Only reason I didn't
just roll over

23:07.820 --> 23:09.422
and stop breathing
was Deakins.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.628
I knew she wouldn't stop
until she found me.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.468
And sure as shit,
in the middle of the night,

23:22.602 --> 23:24.403
in the middle of
the goddamn woods,

23:25.605 --> 23:27.540
she pulls me out
of the ground.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.042
And I didn't deserve it.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.548
She knew it, too.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.497
The address you need...

23:51.531 --> 23:52.632
What's the guy's name?

23:53.199 --> 23:54.433
Kelly.

23:54.734 --> 23:55.735
Ethan Kelly.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.913
Her husband's the one
who's missing?

24:07.279 --> 24:08.515
Uh-huh.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.750
Alice, come on!

24:11.083 --> 24:12.084
Gosh...

24:13.219 --> 24:15.722
That chick looks like she's
one kid short of a meltdown.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.225
Yeah.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.235
-Detective Annou?
-Yes.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.469
This way, please.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.080
-Hi.
-Detective Annou,

24:41.648 --> 24:43.616
-Theresa Archer.
-Thanks for meeting with me.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.684
Of course.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.888
I thought Tuesday was
the worst day of my life.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.959
And then I spoke with
Emma today, Danny's wife.

24:53.826 --> 24:54.994
I'm very sorry for your loss.

24:55.795 --> 24:58.831
So was I, until she told me
about the woman.

24:59.732 --> 25:00.767
Or should I say "girl?"

25:01.868 --> 25:03.069
I feel sick.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.737
So you didn't know
about Mr. Jameson's

25:04.771 --> 25:06.005
extra-marital affairs?

25:06.639 --> 25:07.940
You work with someone
20 years,

25:07.974 --> 25:09.108
you'd think you'd know
something about them.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.579
I used to work for my Dad,
he has a restaurant.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.648
And I'd see the same faces
every day.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.984
Cesar the chef, and
Sal the salad guy,

25:18.217 --> 25:19.552
and Denny the busboy,

25:19.586 --> 25:21.588
and I thought that I knew
nothing about them

25:22.354 --> 25:25.892
until Sal died and his wife
Gwen, she asked me

25:26.192 --> 25:27.694
to say something
at the funeral.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.863
And it turned out I knew
a lot about Sal.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.065
Osmosis or something.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.235
Well, lying and cheating
doesn't osmose.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.206
I'm sorry.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.610
Like I said, today's not
the best of days.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.912
Danny and I started
Ombello together.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.614
Were you two ever...

25:48.147 --> 25:49.148
No.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.817
I was married when we met.

25:51.618 --> 25:54.887
I first saw him in the waiting
room at McKinsey & Co.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.123
We were both interviewing
for the same intern position.

25:57.156 --> 26:00.026
The interviewer was running
an hour behind.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.994
-We got to talking.
-Who got the job?

26:02.328 --> 26:04.063
Neither of us.
I went to Walker Brothers.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.164
He went to Simonson.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.599
But we stayed in touch.

26:06.633 --> 26:07.767
And then about three
years later,

26:07.800 --> 26:09.936
we hung out our own shingle.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.638
You're going to think
I'm an idiot for asking this,

26:12.004 --> 26:14.907
but what exactly do
Management Consultants do?

26:15.274 --> 26:16.776
Ah, well...

26:17.309 --> 26:20.146
I can tell you what
I did today, yesterday.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.715
But tomorrow's is just as much
of a question mark for me

26:22.749 --> 26:23.783
as it is for you.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.952
Executive hand holding mostly.

26:26.352 --> 26:30.189
Let's say a client wants to
open an office in Singapore,

26:30.657 --> 26:32.291
we advise on
the feasibility of that,

26:32.324 --> 26:34.861
we arrange for financing,
we negotiate a lease,

26:34.894 --> 26:35.928
and we staff the office.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.931
Or let's say another client
wants to take-over

26:38.965 --> 26:41.167
a competitor's company
or go public,

26:41.433 --> 26:43.102
we deal with the underwriters,
and lawyers, accountants,

26:43.135 --> 26:44.236
that sort of thing.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.772
Right, you're the smart guys.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.074
Well, one client wanted to
know where the best take-out

26:48.107 --> 26:49.175
Chinese in Scottsdale was

26:49.208 --> 26:50.242
and he called me.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.879
What about girls?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.347
-Do clients ever...
-No.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.284
Not here.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.020
Other firms, they may
get their clients hookers

27:01.053 --> 27:02.689
and coke-fueled free-for-alls,

27:02.722 --> 27:04.190
but no, that doesn't happen
on my watch.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.659
A lot of men here
think I'm a bitch,

27:06.693 --> 27:07.694
and I'm okay with that.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.062
Listen, doing what I do,
if I'm not called a bitch

27:10.096 --> 27:11.430
at least once a day,

27:11.463 --> 27:12.799
I'm doing something wrong.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.369
If any of our consultants ever
offered something like that,

27:17.403 --> 27:18.971
I would tell them to look
for a new job.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.041
What about Mr. Jameson?
What would he tell them?

27:25.845 --> 27:27.246
Danny was good with numbers.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.683
Until today, I thought
that's all he did.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.085
(CLEARS THROAT)

27:34.120 --> 27:36.689
Did Mr. Jameson have an
apartment near the office?

27:36.889 --> 27:38.290
I don't know. You'd
have to ask his wife.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.726
I did. I did.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.460
What about the firm?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.729
Do you have corporate
apartments?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.063
Yes. We have three.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.965
Many of our clients
abhor hotels.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.434
No.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.737
Danny would never ever use...

27:52.004 --> 27:53.940
There's a reason
they call it a secret life.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.376
Emily.

27:58.477 --> 28:01.848
Please, print out a list of
our corporate apartments,

28:01.881 --> 28:03.983
who used them and when and
give that to Detective Annou.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.051
Thank you.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.253
-You'll have complete access.
-Thank you. That's great.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.320
That'll do it.

28:14.326 --> 28:18.765
If either of you knew what
that motherfucker was up to,

28:19.131 --> 28:22.134
I'll rip your cocks off and
shove them down your throats.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.070
-Do you hear me?
-I had no idea.

28:24.303 --> 28:25.304
No?

28:26.372 --> 28:27.874
What about you,
Mr. Tittie Bar?

28:27.907 --> 28:28.908
I didn't know anything.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.743
Take a breath, Terry.

28:30.777 --> 28:31.944
Don't patronize me, Mike.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.347
That girl looked 15 years old
for Christ's sake.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.716
I just spent the last
20 minutes with a cop!

28:38.317 --> 28:40.086
-That's routine, Terry.
-Oh, do you think

28:40.119 --> 28:41.153
that's what Campbell will say?

28:41.187 --> 28:42.221
Or Jasper?
Or Monroe?

28:42.254 --> 28:45.157
I want calls to every CEO
of every company we billed

28:45.191 --> 28:46.759
over seven figures
or more last fiscal.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.295
I'm talking full court
damage control, gentlemen.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.963
-You're overreacting terribly.
-(SCOFFS) Yeah.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.433
You don't think that
Miss Campbell won't be

28:54.466 --> 28:55.301
just slightly perturbed

28:55.902 --> 28:57.436
when she sits down with
her morning coffee

28:57.469 --> 28:59.305
and reads on the front page
of The Chronicle

28:59.338 --> 29:01.273
that a partner in
the consulting firm

29:01.307 --> 29:02.274
her husband speaks to

29:02.308 --> 29:05.077
three times a day
was fucking a teenage nymphet?

29:06.145 --> 29:07.746
Or Mrs. Jasper?
Or Mrs. Monroe?

29:10.917 --> 29:12.118
Tell them that, er...

29:12.819 --> 29:14.486
Tell them that Danny was
on prescribed opiates,

29:14.520 --> 29:16.488
thet we were weaning him
out of the company anyway.

29:16.522 --> 29:17.957
He was fucking sleepwalking.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.193
Tell them anything that
keeps our doors open.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.863
God, you men and your dicks,
you make me sick!

29:30.036 --> 29:31.370
BETHANY: Ombello's
apartments check out.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.806
No evidence Daniel Jameson
ever stayed there.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.474
Fuck, Sleader was right.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.309
-BETHANY: What?
-The meter's running

29:37.343 --> 29:38.911
and this fucking thing's
going nowhere.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.414
Thank you so much
for coming in.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.149
Not a problem.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.253
Mmm. Definitely custom.

30:22.922 --> 30:26.258
The hem is hand stitched.
The needle work is good.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.559
Er, not what you
would call

30:27.593 --> 30:30.062
professional seamstress
quality.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.364
Yeah, I need to
feel the material.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.366
Yeah, I had forensics
cut you a swatch.

30:40.306 --> 30:43.209
FISHBEIN: Silk's pretty good
quality. Chinese.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.312
Any idea where we can find it?

30:47.479 --> 30:50.282
Now, this particular pattern,
not off the top of my head.

30:50.316 --> 30:53.953
Uh, you mind if I take with?
I can ask around?

30:54.553 --> 30:55.955
Find out where it came from
and dinner's on me.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.205
(PHONE RINGING)

31:17.209 --> 31:18.477
-You good?
-I'll take another.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.647
Finnegan. Yeah.

31:22.481 --> 31:23.582
-Yeah.
-(BANGS TABLE)

31:25.217 --> 31:27.486
Whiskey. Whiskey, what?
Whiskey Pit?

31:28.487 --> 31:29.621
In Mission?

31:31.557 --> 31:32.624
Yeah, I got it.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.526
Thanks. I owe you one.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.595
Take care of
that partner of yours.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.567
You ever hear of a bar called
the Whiskey Pit?

31:41.968 --> 31:43.402
Yeah, it closed a couple
of years ago.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.437
They had the best
avocado fries.

31:45.471 --> 31:46.572
That a Cali thing?

31:46.605 --> 31:48.040
Hey don't knock it
till you try it.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.176
-Why'd it close?
-Underage drinking.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.011
Busted too many times.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.679
Not everyone can
tell when a cop's

31:53.712 --> 31:54.981
sitting across from them.

31:55.714 --> 31:56.983
Touche.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.611
Felix, get your ass out here.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.015
Here you go.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.450
Felix!

32:31.483 --> 32:34.086
(CHUCKLES)
Hi, how many are you?

32:34.120 --> 32:35.387
-Just me.
-If you're okay at the counter

32:35.421 --> 32:36.488
I can seat you right now.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.556
Otherwise it's like
a 20-minute wait.

32:37.789 --> 32:38.991
Actually, I prefer
the counter.

32:39.025 --> 32:40.059
Great.

32:40.426 --> 32:41.660
So you're a counter person,
huh?

32:41.693 --> 32:42.594
Absolutely.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.563
A guy sitting at a counter
has got character.

32:45.597 --> 32:46.598
He's got stories to tell.

32:46.632 --> 32:50.036
But a guy at a table by
himself, he's just alone.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.005
-So, you have stories to tell?
-Oh, yeah. Hundreds.

32:53.039 --> 32:54.740
All told to me by guys
sitting at the counter.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.108
(CHUCKLES) I see.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.144
All right, here's the menu.

32:58.544 --> 32:59.745
I'll be back in a sec to tell
you the specials.

33:00.246 --> 33:01.313
Thanks.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.186
Carmel.
That's where I'd retire.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.689
Alone or do you have
somebody special?

33:13.592 --> 33:14.593
Did I hit a nerve?

33:15.494 --> 33:17.729
-What's her name?
-No name, no, I just uh,

33:18.230 --> 33:19.265
no, it's nothing.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.568
Well, I've never
been to Carmel.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.103
Oh, it's great.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.039
You sit back,
you drink a beer,

33:27.073 --> 33:29.108
you watch baby seals
bask in the sun.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.243
-Do you go a lot?
-Carmel?

33:32.178 --> 33:33.745
-I've never been.
-(CHUCKLES)

33:36.748 --> 33:38.384
Excuse me?
Hi, how are you?

33:38.784 --> 33:40.686
Can we get another round?

33:40.719 --> 33:42.588
That's another Scotch for me

33:42.621 --> 33:45.057
-and for, uh...
-Hope.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.626
Hope.
Ray of fuckin' hope.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.761
-(SNICKERS)
-That's all we got.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.264
Martini with a twist.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.068
Our waitress a pill of
positivity or what?

33:56.435 --> 33:58.170
-Totes.
-Totes.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.739
What is it with
the abbreviations these days?

34:00.772 --> 34:02.741
Everything is an abbreviation.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.245
We're grown adults.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.680
When did we start
BFF-ing everything?

34:09.248 --> 34:10.516
I have a...

34:11.350 --> 34:12.818
I have a 13-year-old
daughter.

34:12.851 --> 34:15.654
Get out here.
You don't look old enough.

34:15.687 --> 34:19.125
Oh? Keep it coming with
the compliments.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.160
-Where's she tonight?
-She's with her dad.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.396
We had a nasty custody battle.
He won.

34:26.365 --> 34:28.134
So, I get her every other
weekend.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.402
And I come here to drink
away my sorrows.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.806
To lonely souls.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.118
CLEA: Here you go.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.222
How we doing?
Okay?

34:50.256 --> 34:51.523
Yeah, this is one of
the best burgers

34:51.557 --> 34:52.624
I've had in a long time.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.160
Great! Be sure to come back.

34:54.593 --> 34:55.794
I definitely will.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.729
You know I just moved
from Chicago.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.232
And I got to tell you.
This might be my new spot.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.768
Oh, good, well, I hope you're
not one of those

35:03.202 --> 35:05.137
order-the-same-dish-every time
people?

35:05.171 --> 35:06.505
I do tend to go
with what I know.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.240
Why take unnecessary chances?

35:08.274 --> 35:10.309
-Exactly.
-Just like my father!

35:10.342 --> 35:11.743
Who's just like your father?

35:11.777 --> 35:13.312
Where is this rare individual?

35:13.345 --> 35:14.880
Rare individual.
Hello, Sir.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.915
-Ethan Kelly.
-Monty Annou.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.284
-Pleased to meet you, Sir.
-You as well.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.785
You know, your daughter
was just saying

35:19.818 --> 35:23.455
that she thinks it's wrong to
have the same meal every time.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.524
Well, if you like it, why get
something else?

35:25.891 --> 35:28.194
-Mmm-hmm.
-The whole spirit of adventure

35:28.227 --> 35:30.696
try new things philosophy
is a load of crap.

35:30.729 --> 35:31.597
(CHUCKLES)

35:31.630 --> 35:33.465
-Thank you very much, Sir.
-You're welcome.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.701
Moving here from Chicago
must have been

35:35.734 --> 35:37.169
quite a trauma for you.

35:37.203 --> 35:38.437
Nah, I was ready for a change.

35:39.605 --> 35:40.906
-Really?
-Yeah, an opportunity

35:40.939 --> 35:42.174
presented itself to do

35:42.208 --> 35:43.309
something I've always
wanted to do

35:44.376 --> 35:45.477
and you know after trying
to talk myself out of it,

35:45.511 --> 35:46.778
I kinda said what the hell?

35:47.279 --> 35:48.347
What was the opportunity?

35:48.380 --> 35:49.748
Clea? Why are you
being so nosy?

35:50.316 --> 35:51.617
Why are you still here?

35:51.817 --> 35:54.253
I'm trying to stop you from
interrogating Mr. Kelly.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.621
It's okay, it's okay.
It's fine.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.589
I'm opening a bar
over on 20th and Revere.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.491
A bar! Now that's smart.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.559
Booze is where
the money is.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.461
-I agree.
-You stick with this guy.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.762
-I'll give you her number.
-Oh, really?

36:03.795 --> 36:05.531
Okay. Don't you have
a kitchen to clean?

36:05.564 --> 36:07.466
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-All right.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.501
Don't let her being a cop
scare you off.

36:09.535 --> 36:10.802
(CHUCKLES) I'll try not to.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.839
Wow, your dad
has a character, huh?

36:13.872 --> 36:15.341
God, you have no idea.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.510
-So, you used to be a cop?
-I still am.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.479
Yeah, when I'm not slinging
hash browns.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.781
Really?
So, question for you.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.817
After watching you fly
around here for the last hour

36:26.017 --> 36:27.653
how do you juggle both jobs?

36:28.387 --> 36:29.421
It is what it is.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.324
This place is my father's
whole life.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.925
Has been for 20 years.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.494
It's all he has.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.396
I'm pretty sure
that's not true.

36:39.998 --> 36:41.933
Can I get you some coffee
or dessert?

36:41.967 --> 36:43.435
No, no, no, I'm fine thanks.
Just the check.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.271
Yeah, coming right up.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.584

-Patience, my man, patience.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.601
When you and Tommy
clipped one of my guys,

38:55.867 --> 38:57.035
was that the best move?

38:58.704 --> 38:59.738
Was it?

39:00.639 --> 39:01.940
You're fucking A right it was.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.909
You got rid of
a piece of shit dealer

39:03.942 --> 39:05.944
who was skimming from me
and then to sweeten the deal,

39:06.678 --> 39:07.779
in his place,

39:07.813 --> 39:10.982
I get a feisty redhead built
like a Brahma fucking bull.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.084
I swear to God, luck
like that only happens

39:13.519 --> 39:15.020
when you got a horseshoe
shoved up your ass

39:15.053 --> 39:16.855
and you're fucking on
a field of four leaf clovers.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.057
So guess what, Red?

39:19.825 --> 39:20.959
You're my good luck charm now.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.361
You are my wingman.

39:23.562 --> 39:24.830
If you ask me,
it's a hell of a lot better

39:24.863 --> 39:26.398
than doing a stint
for an accessory

39:26.432 --> 39:27.466
to murder charge.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.067
And if you're honest
with yourself,

39:29.100 --> 39:32.604
you'll realize that I'm doing
you a huge solid.

39:33.839 --> 39:34.973
And I got you a present.

39:35.841 --> 39:36.975

Really?

39:48.554 --> 39:49.588
That's...

39:50.556 --> 39:51.823
That fucking hurts
my feelings.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.125
I got eight buddies
down at division

39:54.159 --> 39:55.827
who know everything
about Ethan Kelly.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.095
So when I don't
show up for work tomorrow,

39:57.128 --> 39:58.730
how do you think it's gonna
end for you?

39:58.764 --> 40:00.466
So, go ahead, shoot me.

40:03.535 --> 40:04.703
Are we done here?
Good.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.139
At the dealer's crib, there's
a big guy at the front door,

40:08.173 --> 40:09.608
big motherfucker,
Samoan I think,

40:10.776 --> 40:11.677
either that or he's biggest
fucking Chink I've ever seen.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.613
He's there mostly for show,
but he is strapped.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.982
At the back door
is a lazy fuck,

40:17.015 --> 40:19.217
probably three bowls
of Cali Kush into him already

40:19.250 --> 40:20.919

Stephen Hawking

40:20.952 --> 40:22.888
in August, he is not a threat.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.024
The main dude at the core,
that's our mark.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.726
He's sitting on at least
200 large.

40:27.759 --> 40:28.627
Two hundred that I need

40:28.660 --> 40:30.028
and 200 that you're gonna
help me extract.

40:31.763 --> 40:32.831
Simple.

40:32.864 --> 40:33.932

off before taxes.

a softer touch?

42:35.020 --> 42:35.954

42:35.987 --> 42:38.156
Tommy's sister-in-law.

Tommy going missing,

51:47.938 --> 51:50.275
Oh, do you want
something else to eat?

51:50.308 --> 51:51.742
Oh, no, I'm okay.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.244
Thank you though, Donna.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.214
It works so good.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.249
Do you want to see my
skates, Uncle Ethan?

51:58.283 --> 51:59.284
Sure, yeah.

51:59.717 --> 52:01.719
You know what?
I have a niece your age.

52:01.919 --> 52:03.721
Maggie, she goes
to your school actually.

52:03.921 --> 52:05.323
And she loves to skate.

52:05.723 --> 52:07.858
Maybe we can all go to Golden
Gate Park one day.

52:08.893 --> 52:10.761
-Would you like that, sweetie?
-Yes, please.

52:11.229 --> 52:12.230
Do you want to see a trick?

52:17.435 --> 52:18.469
Okay.

52:19.504 --> 52:21.239
My Daddy taught
me how to do this.

52:23.474 --> 52:27.312
He could do it in
one swift stroke.

52:28.346 --> 52:31.449
If you blinked,
you missed it.

52:31.482 --> 52:32.517
I wanna try.

52:32.950 --> 52:35.620
Oh, no, no, no.
It's way too dangerous.

52:36.487 --> 52:37.755
You could cut off a finger.

52:38.823 --> 52:40.157
But you know what?

52:41.292 --> 52:42.827
Maybe when you're older,
your daddy can teach

52:42.860 --> 52:43.861
you how to do it.

52:51.636 --> 52:53.238
My daddy's not coming home.

52:55.573 --> 52:56.841
Oh, I'm so sorry.

52:56.874 --> 52:58.609
No, you weren't to know.
It's okay.

53:01.746 --> 53:03.948
You know what?
I think it's time

53:03.981 --> 53:05.283
for me to go.

53:05.316 --> 53:07.452
Before I put
my foot in my mouth again.

53:07.485 --> 53:08.519
Oh!

53:08.919 --> 53:09.954
-Okay.
-Me too.

53:13.924 --> 53:15.860
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, no, thank you.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.828
You're a life saver.
Do it again?

53:17.862 --> 53:19.297
Yeah, that would be great.

53:19.330 --> 53:20.331
Okay.

53:20.698 --> 53:21.732
Bye, Donna.

53:24.669 --> 53:27.238
I want my money.
Fifteen million.

53:27.938 --> 53:29.640
I only got six for the violin.

53:31.276 --> 53:33.378
You sold it short,
not my problem.

53:33.411 --> 53:34.612
Well, that's all I got.

53:35.946 --> 53:37.748
Well that's a real
shame for you, Ethan.

53:39.584 --> 53:40.918
You go near them again,

53:40.951 --> 53:42.520
I'll slice your fucking
head off.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.289
-You got me?
-Yeah, you could.

53:44.689 --> 53:45.723
Think about it.

53:46.524 --> 53:48.593
I got sprung from
Federal custody.

53:49.427 --> 53:51.862
One minute I was heading
to prison and the next,

53:52.330 --> 53:53.898
poof! Here I am.

53:55.633 --> 53:58.303
I have a lot of people.
And they're good.

53:59.570 --> 54:00.838
So, if anything happens to me,

54:01.439 --> 54:03.240
I get arrested, I disappear...

54:04.609 --> 54:06.411
They're gonna make
sure Uncle Ethan is out

54:06.444 --> 54:07.645
a couple of nieces.

54:08.979 --> 54:11.482
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow,

54:12.650 --> 54:15.453
but a month, a year
down the line.

54:17.322 --> 54:21.292
You cross me and those kids
will wind up dead.

54:25.796 --> 54:29.634
You know, giving those girls
a share of your bar?

54:30.768 --> 54:31.669
You're getting soft.

54:32.903 --> 54:35.005
But then, no good
deed goes unpunished, right?

54:37.875 --> 54:39.877
Fifteen million.
By the end of the week.

54:41.879 --> 54:43.514
(SIGHS) I'll be in touch.

54:44.449 --> 54:45.583
It's good to see you, Ethan.
