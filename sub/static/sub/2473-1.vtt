01:57.314 --> 01:59.114
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

01:59.116 --> 02:00.282
<i>Lisa!</i>

02:00.284 --> 02:02.617
<i>Me and Edgar found
the pirate treasure.</i>

02:02.619 --> 02:04.619
<i>Meet us down in the secret cave.</i>

02:04.621 --> 02:07.422
<i>We're gonna spend all
Sunday morning...</i>

02:54.713 --> 02:56.013
Hey, watch out for blinky, okay?

02:56.039 --> 02:57.839
He always traps
you on your left.

02:57.841 --> 02:58.673
Don't!

02:59.710 --> 03:02.444
Lisa, you messed up my game!

03:02.446 --> 03:03.812
Here's your walkie.

03:03.814 --> 03:05.714
Stop waking me up with it, brat.

03:05.716 --> 03:07.182
Edgar left it, not me.

03:07.184 --> 03:09.217
Well, tell Edgar  he's annoying.

03:09.219 --> 03:10.185
You tell him.

03:10.187 --> 03:11.820
He's your imaginary friend.

03:11.822 --> 03:13.054
He's not imaginary.

03:13.456 --> 03:16.324
Lisa, go down to the basement and
start the laundry, will you?

03:16.726 --> 03:17.792
I did it yesterday,

03:17.794 --> 03:19.995
you just don't
remember me doing it.

03:19.997 --> 03:21.763
Stop being a smart aleck.

03:21.765 --> 03:24.332
Buster brown, where's
your glasses?

03:24.334 --> 03:25.767
I lost them.

03:25.769 --> 03:27.401
Well, find them, pronto.

03:27.403 --> 03:30.205
Lisa, have you decided where we're
gonna go for your birthday tomorrow?

03:30.407 --> 03:31.539
Ask me tomorrow.

03:31.541 --> 03:33.207
Okay. Well, I hope we get there,

03:33.309 --> 03:35.977
'cause the car's not running.
Your dad's been trying to fix it all day.

03:35.979 --> 03:37.846
He won't fix it.

03:37.848 --> 03:38.847
Laundry, please.

03:39.049 --> 03:41.182
Cold water only. The hot
wears out the clothes.

03:41.184 --> 03:42.517
I don't think it's possible

03:42.519 --> 03:43.785
for our clothes to wear out,

03:43.787 --> 03:44.719
ever.

03:44.721 --> 03:46.054
Cold water.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.760
Lisa.

04:36.435 --> 04:39.841
Not a smart idea to go anywhere
today, pal, with all this fog.

04:40.543 --> 04:42.844
Stay inside, okay?

04:43.146 --> 04:44.846
Play some games with Robbie or

04:44.848 --> 04:46.181
practice your clarinet.

04:46.183 --> 04:47.738
I'm sure everyone else
in the neighborhood

04:47.764 --> 04:49.147
is staying inside today, too.

04:49.553 --> 04:50.852
Even the phones are out.

04:54.157 --> 04:55.556
Something wrong Lis?

04:55.558 --> 04:56.858
Hmm?

04:57.060 --> 04:58.459
No.

04:58.461 --> 04:59.060
No.

04:59.362 --> 05:00.595
Everything's fine.

05:01.297 --> 05:04.966
I mean, you wouldn't
believe me anyway so...

05:12.368 --> 05:16.168
<i>This is the story of Peter
and the wolf.</i>

05:16.580 --> 05:18.847
<i>Early one morning, Peter opened</i>

05:18.849 --> 05:22.917
<i>the gate and went out into
the big, green meadow.</i>

05:27.691 --> 05:29.557
Lisa!

05:29.560 --> 05:31.492
Come downstairs, will you?

05:31.594 --> 05:34.562
Your father and I
want to have a talk.

05:39.903 --> 05:40.669
Your mom says

05:40.671 --> 05:43.772
you've been acting kind of
funny all morning.

05:44.374 --> 05:46.475
Funny how?

05:47.277 --> 05:48.643
Well, for one thing,

05:48.645 --> 05:50.745
some clothes are missing
from the laundry.

05:50.747 --> 05:52.947
Do you know where they are?

05:54.351 --> 05:56.484
Honestly, I really don't know

05:56.486 --> 06:00.188
where they went.

06:00.190 --> 06:06.060
The truth is, they're
gone every day.

06:06.062 --> 06:09.964
And what does that mean,
"gone every day"?

06:10.266 --> 06:11.603
Okay,

06:12.229 --> 06:14.269
it's like mom's pancakes.

06:14.271 --> 06:15.637
Every morning, she makes them

06:15.639 --> 06:17.105
for breakfast, and you're always

06:17.107 --> 06:18.606
trying to fix the car, which for

06:18.608 --> 06:21.176
some mysterious reason has
always stopped running.

06:21.178 --> 06:23.077
Then, Mac and cheese for lunch.

06:23.079 --> 06:27.448
Then, we have meat loaf
for dinner every night.

06:27.450 --> 06:29.384
And at 8:00, we watch,

06:29.386 --> 06:31.085
"murder, she wrote" and go to

06:31.087 --> 06:36.558
bed, wake up tomorrow, and
do the exact same thing.

06:36.860 --> 06:39.690
Well, you and Robbie have school
tomorrow, and I have work, so...

06:39.696 --> 06:41.262
There is no school.

06:41.264 --> 06:42.530
There is no work.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.333
And what about your birthday?
That's not tomorrow either?

06:45.335 --> 06:46.400
No.

06:46.402 --> 06:47.902
Never comes.

06:47.904 --> 06:50.538
It's always the day
before I turn 16.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.407
It's pretty frustrating.

06:52.409 --> 06:54.709
I'm really trying to

06:54.711 --> 06:56.711
understand where this is
all coming from, pal.

06:57.713 --> 06:59.547
Are... are you bored
with your life?

06:59.749 --> 07:00.448
Is that it?

07:00.450 --> 07:02.417
I mean, are you anxious
about something?

07:02.619 --> 07:04.886
- Is it a boy?
- No, no, mum! God, no!

07:04.888 --> 07:07.121
You just don't understand it,
like, at all!

07:07.123 --> 07:08.289
Well, explain it to us.

07:08.291 --> 07:09.357
Maybe we can understand.

07:09.959 --> 07:11.860
That's the thing,

07:11.862 --> 07:13.728
is that I have tried to
explain it many times,

07:13.730 --> 07:16.431
and you guys just never remember
and you don't believe me.

07:16.433 --> 07:18.934
Believe what?

07:19.936 --> 07:21.302
That we're stuck in this house

07:21.504 --> 07:23.938
and we're never gonna leave.

07:23.940 --> 07:24.973
Why?

07:24.975 --> 07:25.940
Because all of us...

07:25.942 --> 07:27.642
Shut up, Lisa, shut up!

07:27.644 --> 07:29.644
Enough is enough, Lisa!

07:29.646 --> 07:31.512
Shh.

07:31.514 --> 07:32.347
Hey, hey.

07:32.349 --> 07:33.748
It's okay, buckaroo.

07:33.750 --> 07:34.182
Shh.

07:34.184 --> 07:36.351
Your sister is just
playing a silly game.

07:36.653 --> 07:40.688
Lisa, you tell your brother
that everything is okay.

07:40.990 --> 07:44.659
Lisa?

07:44.661 --> 07:47.729
I'm gonna go finish playing
the clarinet in my room.

07:48.131 --> 07:52.166
Let me know when the Mac
and cheese is ready.

08:30.006 --> 08:33.006
<i>Safe-deposit key...</i>

08:33.009 --> 08:36.210
<i>is that what you were looking
for, captain downing?</i>

08:36.212 --> 08:38.203
<i>Or should I say, Mr. downing</i>

08:38.230 --> 08:40.414
<i>or whatever your name is?</i>

08:46.265 --> 08:47.765
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

08:47.791 --> 08:50.091
<i>Me and Edgar found
the pirate treasure.</i>

08:50.093 --> 08:52.026
<i>Meet us down in the secret cave.</i>

08:52.028 --> 08:54.395
<i>We're gonna spend all
Sunday morning there.</i>

09:27.430 --> 09:28.623
Lisa?

09:28.699 --> 09:31.266
Go downstairs to the basement
and start the laundry, will you?

09:31.768 --> 09:33.101
I did it yesterday.

09:33.103 --> 09:34.869
You just don't
remember me doing it.

09:34.871 --> 09:36.270
Stop being a smart aleck.

09:36.272 --> 09:38.306
Hey, Charlie brown,
where's your glasses?

09:38.308 --> 09:39.540
I don't know.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.442
Well, find them, pronto.

09:41.644 --> 09:44.545
Lisa, have you decided where we're
gonna go for your birthday tomorrow?

09:44.547 --> 09:45.847
Ask me tomorrow.

09:46.449 --> 09:48.516
Well, I hope we get there,
because the car's not running.

09:48.518 --> 09:50.618
Your dad's been trying
to fix it all day.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.086
Laundry, please.

09:52.088 --> 09:53.254
Cold water only.

09:53.256 --> 09:55.857
Hot wears out the clothes.

09:55.859 --> 09:57.325
Thank you.

11:14.558 --> 11:18.158
<i>Thank you, and welcome to the
white house.</i>

11:18.410 --> 11:19.875
<i>In a moment, I will be</i>

11:19.877 --> 11:21.744
<i>sitting at that desk,</i>

11:21.746 --> 11:24.312
<i>taking up a pen
and signing the most</i>

<i>To all of you here today,</i>

11:29.919 --> 11:31.586
<i>who've worked so hard and long</i>

11:31.588 --> 11:33.321
<i>to see this day come, my thanks.</i>

11:33.323 --> 11:35.690
<i>And the thanks of a
nation go out to you.</i>

11:35.960 --> 11:38.627
<i>They haven't made this the
freest country and the mightiest</i>

11:38.629 --> 11:42.397
<i>economic force on this planet
by shrinking from challenges.</i>

11:42.699 --> 11:43.898
<i>They never gave up.</i>

11:43.900 --> 11:46.968
<i>And after almost 3 years of
commitment and hard work...</i>

11:52.676 --> 11:54.975
<i>"The impossible became
the inevitable."</i>

11:57.246 --> 11:58.880
<i>Early one morning,</i>

11:58.882 --> 12:00.948

12:09.475 --> 12:11.175
<i>Lisa</i>

12:41.391 --> 12:43.257
Did you wash everything
in this load?

12:43.259 --> 12:44.492
Some clothes are missing.

12:44.494 --> 12:45.526
Yeah, I know.

12:45.528 --> 12:47.227
So, where are they?

12:47.229 --> 12:48.162
I don't know, mom. Okay?

12:48.164 --> 12:50.164
Those clothes are missing,
like, every single day.

12:50.766 --> 12:52.833
Come downstairs, will you?

12:52.835 --> 12:56.270
Your father and I
want to have a talk.

13:05.172 --> 13:06.148
Your mom says

13:06.174 --> 13:09.186

16:42.111 --> 16:43.511
Lisa?

16:43.565 --> 16:46.133
Sweetheart, pancakes are ready!

18:25.377 --> 18:27.377
<i>And...</i>

18:27.703 --> 18:30.037
<i>We're in focus.</i>

18:30.039 --> 18:32.306
<i>Okay.</i>

18:34.276 --> 18:36.443
<i>Our new home.</i>

18:46.322 --> 18:48.388
<i>We're in focus. Okay.</i>

18:58.401 --> 19:00.167
<i>We're in focus.</i>

19:00.169 --> 19:01.669

19:03.306 --> 19:05.839
Who are you?

19:41.563 --> 19:43.563
Hello?

19:46.789 --> 19:49.288
Is anybody here?

19:49.986 --> 19:52.486
Was that you playing
the clarinet?

19:52.488 --> 19:54.788
Are you trying to contact me?

20:03.190 --> 20:05.074
Are you dead?

20:07.003 --> 20:10.037
Are you... Alive?

20:23.939 --> 20:25.239
Lisa?

20:25.254 --> 20:26.086
What?

20:26.088 --> 20:27.721
What are you doing up there?

20:27.723 --> 20:28.188
Nothing.

20:28.190 --> 20:30.357
Some clothes are missing
from the laundry.

20:30.559 --> 20:31.692
Do you know where they are?

20:31.694 --> 20:32.926
No.

20:32.928 --> 20:34.228
Well, they went somewhere.

20:34.230 --> 20:35.796
Okay, just give me a second.

21:07.259 --> 21:09.530
Well, Bruce, if you get the
car fixed, I'd love it if you

21:09.532 --> 21:10.931
could go and get a few groceries.

21:10.933 --> 21:11.465
Okay.

21:11.467 --> 21:12.533
Well, I'm working on it.

21:12.735 --> 21:14.734
So I have no idea where to start
with it,

21:14.736 --> 21:16.136
but I am working on it.

21:16.238 --> 21:18.305
Mom, can I go play with Edgar?

21:18.307 --> 21:20.941
What about chocolate
ice cream for dessert?

21:21.543 --> 21:23.844
Me and Edgar will both
have double scoops.

21:23.846 --> 21:26.814
No. You will each
have one scoop.

21:26.816 --> 21:29.216
Go ahead, Mr. Magoo.

21:29.818 --> 21:31.885
Lisa, you haven't even touched
your meat loaf.

21:32.187 --> 21:34.221
Meat is murder.

21:44.826 --> 21:46.326
What's the matter, Lis?

21:46.327 --> 21:47.577
Since when do you smoke?

21:48.003 --> 21:49.403
Sorry?

21:50.005 --> 21:51.938
That's not part of the routine.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.841
I've never seen
you smoke before.

21:53.843 --> 21:55.175
Your father always smokes

21:55.177 --> 21:57.377
after dinner, but he's gonna quit.
Right, Bruce?

21:57.379 --> 21:58.779
Absolutely.

21:59.316 --> 22:00.948
A scoop for you tonight, honey?

22:01.350 --> 22:03.851
- What's wrong with two scoops?
- God, you're as bad as Robbie.

22:03.853 --> 22:05.886
One or two scoops for you, Lisa?

22:24.330 --> 22:26.430
Where's dad and Robbie?

22:26.455 --> 22:29.477
Uh, your father is in the
garage fixing the car, and

22:29.478 --> 22:32.379
Robbie's up in his room
playing video games.

22:32.981 --> 22:35.315
What about "murder, she wrote"?

22:35.717 --> 22:38.018
Oh, sweetheart, do you
mind watching it upstairs?

22:38.020 --> 22:41.255
I just... I really want
to finish this chapter.

22:54.171 --> 22:56.136
I know. I know, I know.

22:56.138 --> 22:57.604
See if I can get this
son of a bitch working.

22:57.606 --> 22:58.505
I don't know.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.241
I don't know why it won't work.

23:01.443 --> 23:03.177
I just don't.

23:06.015 --> 23:07.315
Lisa?

23:10.452 --> 23:11.618
Go to back inside, Lisa.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.089
I got a lot of work here to do.

23:15.691 --> 23:17.926
Go on.

23:20.295 --> 23:22.128
You, uh, go ahead, sweetheart.

23:22.330 --> 23:24.164
Good night.

23:24.466 --> 23:26.769
Good night, dad.

24:19.098 --> 24:21.098
<i>Lisa.</i>

24:22.524 --> 24:23.757
Who are you?

24:25.461 --> 24:27.794
Why are you here?
What do you want?

24:28.196 --> 24:30.897
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

24:35.170 --> 24:37.170
Get away!

24:55.292 --> 24:57.177
<i>Lisa... Lisa, are you there?</i>

24:57.203 --> 24:58.350
<i>Wake up, please.</i>

24:58.627 --> 25:00.994
<i>Something's wrong. I'm hiding.</i>

25:00.996 --> 25:02.996
<i>Come downstairs quick.</i>

25:06.101 --> 25:07.467
Bruce, stop it!

25:07.469 --> 25:09.069
Stop it!

25:09.271 --> 25:10.070
What?

25:10.072 --> 25:11.071
Stop it!

25:13.609 --> 25:15.275
Then tell me where they are.

25:15.277 --> 25:17.646
I have no idea.

25:22.684 --> 25:24.551
You stole them from me.

25:24.553 --> 25:26.553
Why would I do that, Bruce?

25:26.655 --> 25:28.555
You stole them.

25:28.557 --> 25:30.323
Stop lying!

25:30.525 --> 25:33.093
Mom?

25:33.095 --> 25:35.763
Dad?

25:36.265 --> 25:37.831
Lisa, go upstairs.

25:37.833 --> 25:40.067
Take Robbie with you.

25:40.669 --> 25:44.638
Do you know where the
spark plugs are, Lisa?

25:45.040 --> 25:46.807
The... the what?

25:46.809 --> 25:50.277
I have been trying to fix the

25:50.279 --> 25:53.814
car all morning, and I've now

25:53.816 --> 25:56.483
discovered that it's just the

25:56.485 --> 25:57.684
spark plugs.

25:57.686 --> 26:00.120
They're missing from the engine.

26:00.122 --> 26:02.689
Somebody's taken them.

26:03.991 --> 26:06.560
Was it you?

26:07.062 --> 26:08.328
Was it you?!

26:10.566 --> 26:13.233
No.

26:13.235 --> 26:14.267
No, dad.

26:14.269 --> 26:16.703
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:35.935 --> 26:38.935
- Mom, no, don't answer it.
- Why not?

26:39.561 --> 26:41.728
Please. Please, mom, don't.

26:42.330 --> 26:44.831
Lisa, I am not gonna shut out
the rest of the world just

26:44.833 --> 26:47.134
because your father
gets upset sometimes.

26:58.941 --> 27:02.541
Good morning, ma'am.
I'm from the phone company.

27:03.185 --> 27:05.519
We're checking the lines
in the neighborhood today.

27:05.521 --> 27:07.487
Has your phone been
out this morning?

27:07.489 --> 27:08.922
Well, yes, in fact, it has.

27:09.124 --> 27:11.858
We get a lot of static
because of the fog.

27:11.860 --> 27:13.893
I'm terribly sorry for
the inconvenience.

27:13.895 --> 27:16.229
Do you mind if I come
in and check the Jacks?

27:16.331 --> 27:18.498
Yes, of course.

28:08.555 --> 28:11.755
Well, it looks like you folks
got quite a mess on your hands,

28:11.820 --> 28:13.989
down here.

28:16.591 --> 28:19.125
I'll check upstairs first.

28:31.327 --> 28:34.179
Lisa? Laundry.

28:34.877 --> 28:37.412
Cold, not hot.

28:39.314 --> 28:41.815
Lisa, do what your mother says.

28:43.285 --> 28:45.552
I... I forgot something in my room.

28:45.554 --> 28:50.290
I'll... I'll be
back in a minute.

29:27.567 --> 29:31.167
How long have you been awake?

29:32.392 --> 29:33.692
What?

29:35.270 --> 29:37.270
How long have you known,

29:37.972 --> 29:40.607
understood?

29:41.509 --> 29:43.209
Um...

29:43.411 --> 29:44.477
I don't... I don't know.

29:44.479 --> 29:47.847
Um, a... a week, maybe.

29:47.849 --> 29:49.849
I... I'm not sure.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.790
Who are you?

29:56.992 --> 29:58.299
What's going on? What...

29:58.325 --> 30:00.451
What happened to us?
I...

30:17.232 --> 30:20.632
Whenever you hear strange
noises in this house,

30:20.657 --> 30:24.584
or voices calling out
to you, ignore them.

30:24.586 --> 30:27.621
Pretend they don't exist, Lisa.

30:27.623 --> 30:29.922
If you should try to contact 
the living,

30:30.324 --> 30:32.726
or anyone else,

30:32.828 --> 30:34.928
you and your family 
will suffer in ways

30:34.930 --> 30:37.998
you cannot fathom.

30:55.385 --> 30:57.017
Have yourself a wonderful day.

30:57.519 --> 30:58.918
Okay, thank you.

31:02.259 --> 31:05.494
So, Lisa, you gonna start the
laundry?

31:11.199 --> 31:13.200
Did you put something different
in the meat loaf tonight, honey?

31:13.202 --> 31:14.801
'Cause it's... it's fantastic.

31:14.803 --> 31:16.503
I put a little bit
of paprika in it.

31:16.505 --> 31:17.504
That might have done it.

31:17.806 --> 31:19.539
Mom, can I go play with Edgar?

31:19.974 --> 31:23.010
What about chocolate
ice cream for dessert?

31:24.012 --> 31:26.680
Me and Edgar will both
have double scoops.

31:26.682 --> 31:28.815
No, you and Edgar will each

31:28.817 --> 31:30.016
have one scoop.

31:30.018 --> 31:34.020
Go ahead, yosemite Sam.

31:34.022 --> 31:36.990
Lisa, you haven't even
touched your meat loaf.

31:38.193 --> 31:40.728
Ah.

31:41.730 --> 31:43.563
That was amazing.

31:44.999 --> 31:46.399
Where's your cigarette?

31:46.401 --> 31:47.400
I'm sorry?

31:48.002 --> 31:50.303
Don't you always
smoke after dinner?

31:50.305 --> 31:51.905
I don't know what you're
talking about, Lisa.

31:51.907 --> 31:52.672
I don't smoke.

31:52.674 --> 31:54.574
Don't you start
either, young lady.

31:54.576 --> 31:56.910
The surgeon general just came
out with a warning that if...

31:56.912 --> 31:58.311
Wait. How... how can you just act

31:58.313 --> 32:01.248
like nothing even
happened this morning?

32:01.450 --> 32:03.985
This morning?

32:05.087 --> 32:08.050
Are you talking about the clothes
that are missing from the laundry?

32:08.056 --> 32:10.023
Do you know where they are?

32:14.325 --> 32:15.595
Have you decided
where you want to go

32:15.597 --> 32:16.796
for your birthday tomorrow?

32:16.798 --> 32:19.399
Your father gets home at 6:00, so
I was thinking that we could just...

32:19.401 --> 32:20.600
Sorry.

32:20.702 --> 32:24.237
What?

32:24.239 --> 32:26.506
I just... I can't do it anymore.

32:26.508 --> 32:28.508
You can't do what?

32:29.410 --> 32:30.376
I'm sorry.

32:30.778 --> 32:33.880
Where are you going? You
haven't been excused, Lis.

32:37.582 --> 32:40.654
Lisa, where are you going?
It's not safe out there.

32:41.256 --> 32:42.922
Lisa!

32:42.924 --> 32:45.191
Lisa, stop! Come back here!

32:45.193 --> 32:47.460
Lisa!

32:47.462 --> 32:49.662
Lisa!

32:53.864 --> 32:55.224
Hello?

32:56.650 --> 32:58.889
Hey, is anyone out there?

33:00.240 --> 33:02.141
Hello?

33:06.466 --> 33:08.466
Hello?

33:10.543 --> 33:13.486
Please I don't want to
be stuck here anymore.

33:14.488 --> 33:17.391
You hear me? I said
I don't want...

33:18.893 --> 33:20.292
There you are.

33:21.095 --> 33:22.061
Come on back inside, pal,

33:22.063 --> 33:24.197
it's just not safe
riding out there.

33:24.699 --> 33:26.599
Bring your bike back
into the garage.

33:26.601 --> 33:28.768
You can then... Lisa!

33:51.993 --> 33:54.027
Okay, no more games, young lady.

33:54.029 --> 33:54.961
Get inside now.

33:54.963 --> 33:56.296
Mom's got dessert on the table,

33:56.298 --> 33:59.098
and "murder, she wrote"
is just about to start.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.716
Are you here?

34:15.217 --> 34:18.219
I'm sorry I told you to go away
last night.

34:20.821 --> 34:23.024
I was just scared.

34:24.626 --> 34:28.628
I know it should be the other way around...
right?... Since...

34:29.030 --> 34:32.965
You're the one who's alive and
I'm the one who's... Dead?

34:32.967 --> 34:36.768
God, it feels weird
just saying that.

34:36.771 --> 34:39.838
I don't know how I died or why
or...

34:40.540 --> 34:44.612
How long I've been stuck in this
stupid routine with my family.

34:46.714 --> 34:50.984
It's kind of like we've been sleepwalking
for a really long time, but...

34:51.085 --> 34:52.952
Now I'm awake.

35:03.527 --> 35:05.827
There's someone else here, too.

35:08.870 --> 35:11.137
He's dead like me, I think.

35:16.541 --> 35:20.313
He doesn't want me to be awake
or aware.

35:20.415 --> 35:24.717
He told me not to contact you.

35:25.319 --> 35:28.721
But I need to find a way out of
here, and you're the only hope

35:28.723 --> 35:31.691
I've got to figure it out, so...

35:32.893 --> 35:35.329
Please.

35:36.631 --> 35:38.867
Please just talk to me.

35:41.669 --> 35:43.669
Who are you?

35:50.071 --> 35:52.071
What's your name?

35:58.147 --> 36:01.188
What's the first
letter of your name?

36:07.090 --> 36:10.690
You have to move the piece to
the first letter.

36:13.368 --> 36:15.434
Just move it anywhere.

36:18.936 --> 36:21.407
Just say something!

38:01.943 --> 38:03.810
Lisa?

38:04.880 --> 38:06.612
Help me, Lisa.

38:06.614 --> 38:08.013
Please help me.

38:11.886 --> 38:12.885
Olivia?

38:12.887 --> 38:14.053
What are you doing in there?

38:14.655 --> 38:16.889
Look under the floor.

38:16.891 --> 38:18.558
Olivia, what's happening?

38:18.560 --> 38:20.093
You okay?

38:20.095 --> 38:21.594
Open the door.

38:21.596 --> 38:23.129
Olivia!

38:45.405 --> 38:47.089
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

38:47.288 --> 38:48.020
<i>Lisa!</i>

38:48.022 --> 38:50.389
<i>Me and Edgar found
the pirate treasure.</i>

38:50.391 --> 38:52.558
<i>Meet us down in the secret cave.</i>

38:52.560 --> 38:55.695
<i>We're gonna spend all
Sunday morning there.</i>

43:11.085 --> 43:12.887
Hello?

43:15.790 --> 43:17.590
Help me.

43:45.352 --> 43:46.886
Lisa!

43:47.288 --> 43:49.755
Sweetheart, pancakes are ready.

43:49.757 --> 43:52.625
Come and help set
the table, please.

43:54.328 --> 43:56.429
You know this is
homemade syrup, huh?

43:56.631 --> 43:57.430
Homemade syrup?

43:57.432 --> 43:59.532
What, you tap the trees
in the backyard?

44:00.501 --> 44:01.867
No, Bruce.

44:03.669 --> 44:04.570
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm?

44:04.572 --> 44:06.772
Edgar wants more pancakes.

44:06.774 --> 44:09.541
Ask and Edgar shall receive.

44:20.587 --> 44:21.987
Phones are working again.

44:21.989 --> 44:24.323
I've got it.

44:30.427 --> 44:31.764
Hello.

44:31.766 --> 44:33.832
Yes.
Can I ask who's calling, please?

44:36.303 --> 44:37.536
Certainly.

44:37.538 --> 44:38.871
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

44:38.873 --> 44:39.705
Just a sec.

44:39.707 --> 44:42.241
Lis, it's a Mr. woods. 
He says there's been some

44:42.243 --> 44:43.942
changes to your lab assignment.

44:43.944 --> 44:45.344
He wants to talk to you about it.

44:47.247 --> 44:48.781
Lise, come on. Don't
keep him waiting.

44:48.783 --> 44:51.750
I'm sure he's got lots of other
students he's got to call.

45:11.891 --> 45:14.891
Lis, take the phone.

45:17.616 --> 45:19.616
Goodness sakes.

45:26.514 --> 45:29.414
<i>I thought I told you to mind
your own business.</i>

45:29.624 --> 45:32.492
<i>You are a busy Betty,</i>

45:32.494 --> 45:35.060
<i>and I don't like busy betties.</i>

45:35.829 --> 45:39.598
What's down in that room
under the basement?

45:39.600 --> 45:41.233
Who's down there?

45:41.235 --> 45:43.935
I mean, that's your scrapbook
under my bedroom floor, isn't?

45:43.938 --> 45:45.804
<i>This is my house, Lisa.</i>

45:45.806 --> 45:47.239
<i>It always has been.</i>

45:47.241 --> 45:48.874
Why are you keeping us here?

45:48.876 --> 45:52.011
<i>Stop opening doors that
are meant to be closed.</i>

45:52.081 --> 45:53.213
Why?

45:53.515 --> 45:56.782
What are you gonna do to me?
I'm already dead.

45:56.784 --> 45:57.916
Lisa.

45:58.318 --> 45:59.918
Come and finish your
breakfast, please.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.121
It's gonna get cold.

46:25.302 --> 46:27.802
Mom, can I go play with Edgar?

46:27.849 --> 46:28.814
Okay.

46:28.816 --> 46:30.349
Finish your pancakes first.

46:30.351 --> 46:31.483
You get away from him!

46:31.485 --> 46:33.319
Lisa, no! He's my friend!

46:33.321 --> 46:34.620
Lisa, what are you doing?

46:34.622 --> 46:35.955
Don't you see him?!

46:35.957 --> 46:36.989
See who?

46:36.991 --> 46:38.924
Edgar!

46:38.926 --> 46:40.993
Lisa, stop teasing your brother.

46:40.995 --> 46:44.530
I'm not! He's right...

46:44.832 --> 46:46.531
Lisa.

46:46.601 --> 46:49.671
They only see what I let them
see, Lisa, and so do you.

47:03.544 --> 47:05.592
Mom... Dad?

47:08.656 --> 47:10.022
Robbie?

47:14.862 --> 47:17.830
Oh, Robbie!

47:17.832 --> 47:19.965
No, no, no, Robbie!

47:20.567 --> 47:21.734
Please wake up!

47:21.736 --> 47:24.136
Mom, dad, wake up.

47:24.138 --> 47:25.371
Wake up!

47:25.373 --> 47:27.139
Please wake up.

47:27.341 --> 47:29.174
Oh.

47:33.414 --> 47:35.614
Oh. Oh.

48:02.799 --> 48:03.799
No!

48:06.681 --> 48:08.881
No, no, please!

48:09.083 --> 48:12.351
Please, I don't
want to be alone!

48:12.753 --> 48:15.454
I don't want to be
alone in this house!

48:15.456 --> 48:16.455
Please!

48:17.591 --> 48:20.192
Please bring them back!

48:20.194 --> 48:21.126
Please!

48:22.763 --> 48:25.063
Lisa?

48:29.135 --> 48:31.202
Lis, what's wrong?

48:31.304 --> 48:32.070
Talk to me.

48:32.072 --> 48:34.272
Sweetheart, it's okay.

48:34.374 --> 48:35.440
It's okay.

48:35.442 --> 48:37.475
Everything's all right.

48:37.477 --> 48:39.211
I got you, pal.

48:39.913 --> 48:41.913
I got you.

48:54.824 --> 48:56.324
<i>Lisa.</i>

49:00.330 --> 49:04.136
Leave me alone!
Please!

49:04.138 --> 49:05.738
This is all a mistake.

49:07.107 --> 49:10.676
Things need to go back
the way they were.

49:12.613 --> 49:14.880
Go away!

50:13.002 --> 50:14.402
<i>Lisa.</i>

52:12.985 --> 52:15.485
Olivia, come play with me.

52:15.510 --> 52:16.963
Olivia?

52:17.364 --> 52:18.930
We're having eggs and bacon,

52:18.932 --> 52:20.499
so come help me set the table.

52:20.901 --> 52:23.301
How'd you sleep last night?

52:23.303 --> 52:25.670
No more sleepwalking, right?

52:26.674 --> 52:28.974
Your father.

52:34.979 --> 52:38.450
Come on.
I know, I know, I know.

52:38.652 --> 52:40.652
God damn it. I know.

52:40.654 --> 52:42.321
God, this son of a bitch.

52:43.523 --> 52:44.989
Oh, God.

52:44.991 --> 52:47.124
Ah, I can't figure
out why it won't.

52:48.628 --> 52:50.228
Come on, work.

52:50.230 --> 52:51.330
Come on.

52:51.932 --> 52:53.799
I don't know, I don't know.

52:53.801 --> 52:55.467
Son of a bitch.

52:58.872 --> 53:01.272
Need something, Olivia?

53:05.044 --> 53:07.878
You need you to go
back inside, okay?

53:07.880 --> 53:09.447
I'm busy.

53:10.884 --> 53:12.718
Come on.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.686
Oh, come on.

53:15.488 --> 53:17.322
Damn it!

53:18.325 --> 53:20.492
I don't want you coming
in here when I'm working.

53:20.694 --> 53:22.093
You understand?

53:22.795 --> 53:24.997
Do you understand?

53:25.399 --> 53:27.199
I said, get out!

53:36.077 --> 53:38.510
Lisa. Lisa. Oh, my God.

53:38.912 --> 53:41.712
Are you okay?

53:41.915 --> 53:43.114
What happened?

53:43.116 --> 53:45.517
I think she's sleepwalking.

53:45.519 --> 53:46.885
I was standing in the kitchen,

53:46.887 --> 53:49.187
and she just walked right
past me and came in here.

53:49.189 --> 53:51.456
Sweetheart, you okay?

53:54.460 --> 53:56.995
- I think we should call a doctor.
- The phones are still out.

53:56.997 --> 53:58.930
Well, we should do
something, Bruce.

53:58.932 --> 54:01.733
Mom, I'm fine.

54:02.335 --> 54:05.337
Can you just bring me
some Mac and cheese?

54:05.339 --> 54:07.374
Yes, of course.

54:09.376 --> 54:11.810
Okay pal...

54:11.812 --> 54:17.315
I'm gonna be down in the garage
if you need anything, all right?

54:17.517 --> 54:19.151
Dad?

54:19.153 --> 54:21.119
Yeah?

54:21.121 --> 54:23.321
Did you find the spark plugs?

54:23.323 --> 54:25.157
The spark plugs?

54:26.759 --> 54:28.459
That's why the car won't
start.

54:28.862 --> 54:30.695
Oh, uh, no.

54:30.733 --> 54:34.767
I'm pretty sure it's
just an engine valve.

54:35.769 --> 54:37.903
Don't worry, though, I'll have
it fixed before your birthday

54:37.905 --> 54:40.973
tomorrow, and we'll all
have a great time.

54:41.375 --> 54:44.109
You can pick any restaurant
you want to go to.

54:44.111 --> 54:46.144
It'll be your special day.

54:49.346 --> 54:51.053
Lise, are you okay?

54:52.979 --> 54:54.719
How about we go to
hackney's tomorrow?

54:54.721 --> 54:57.088
Uh-huh. You got a craving
for some onion rings.

54:57.090 --> 55:00.392
Yeah and I'll... I'll get the
butterscotch sundae to share.

55:00.394 --> 55:02.294
You know my weakness, don't you?

55:03.063 --> 55:05.064
Yeah, I think so.

55:06.966 --> 55:09.034
You get some rest, Lis.

55:09.836 --> 55:10.602
Love you.

55:10.604 --> 55:15.173
Love you too, dad.

55:26.044 --> 55:27.544
Olivia?

55:30.855 --> 55:33.258
Olivia, can you hear me?

55:37.160 --> 55:40.860
Olivia.
Olivia, where are you?

55:42.002 --> 55:43.201
I need you to bring me back.

55:43.203 --> 55:45.103
I need you to show me
everything that you...

55:45.606 --> 55:46.337
<i>Lisa.</i>

55:46.339 --> 55:48.673
<i>Come in, Lisa, please.</i>

55:52.875 --> 55:54.075
Robbie?

55:54.214 --> 55:55.213
<i>Hi, Lisa.</i>

55:55.215 --> 55:58.483
<i>Edgar says you need to be
punished for being bad.</i>

55:58.485 --> 56:00.519
<i>He says you're a busy Betty.</i>

56:02.422 --> 56:04.055
Robbie where are you?

56:04.057 --> 56:05.590
<i>The secret cave.</i>

56:05.592 --> 56:06.925
<i>Edgar's with me.</i>

56:07.527 --> 56:09.794
<i>We're on a treasure hunt.</i>

56:10.764 --> 56:11.997
Where is the secret...

56:13.233 --> 56:15.667
Robbie?

56:25.592 --> 56:27.692
Robbie?

56:32.947 --> 56:35.453
Robbie, are you in here?

56:45.332 --> 56:46.332
Robbie?

56:53.407 --> 56:55.507
Robbie?

57:09.756 --> 57:11.923
Robbie?

57:15.448 --> 57:17.448
Robbie!

57:18.173 --> 57:20.173
Robbie!

57:22.402 --> 57:23.768
Oh!

57:23.770 --> 57:25.770
Oh, my God.

57:27.540 --> 57:29.073
<i>Lisa?</i>

57:29.075 --> 57:29.974
Robbie.

57:29.976 --> 57:31.309
<i>Hi, Lisa.</i>

57:31.411 --> 57:32.443
Robbie, where are you?

57:32.445 --> 57:34.412
You told me you were
in the secret cave.

57:34.414 --> 57:35.680
<i>We tricked you.</i>

57:35.682 --> 57:36.481
What?!

57:36.483 --> 57:38.750
<i>I'm in the attic, Lisa.</i>

57:38.752 --> 57:41.620
<i>I was hiding from
you the whole time.</i>

57:41.622 --> 57:43.688
<i>Edgar says we've won the game.</i>

57:44.491 --> 57:47.092
Robbie. Robbie?

57:48.495 --> 57:49.961
Damn it!

57:53.100 --> 57:54.132
Don't worry.

57:54.134 --> 57:55.734
I'll watch Robbie for you.

57:55.736 --> 57:57.469
No, no, no!

57:57.471 --> 57:59.037
No, no, no, no, no!

57:59.039 --> 57:59.771
No, no!

57:59.773 --> 58:02.340
Let me out of here,
you son of a bitch!

58:02.742 --> 58:04.709
Somebody help me, please!

58:04.711 --> 58:07.279
Please! No!

58:51.582 --> 58:52.582
Hello?

59:21.207 --> 59:22.207
Hello?

59:22.289 --> 59:23.788
Okay.

59:35.869 --> 59:37.601
Dad, is that you?

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.140
Hello?

01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:32.793
Did he get you, too?

01:00:35.495 --> 01:00:36.261
Who are you?

01:00:36.263 --> 01:00:38.529
How long have you
been his prisoner?

01:00:39.331 --> 01:00:41.733
Oh, my God.

01:00:42.669 --> 01:00:43.402
You're...

01:00:43.404 --> 01:00:44.936
you're Frances Nichols.

01:00:44.938 --> 01:00:47.639
You were the first
girl he kidnapped.

01:00:48.441 --> 01:00:49.574
Who was he?

01:00:49.576 --> 01:00:51.977
Get away. I have to get this
door open before he comes back.

01:00:51.979 --> 01:00:54.379
No, please. Tell me who he was.

01:00:55.081 --> 01:00:57.582
Please tell me.

01:00:57.684 --> 01:00:58.783
Please.

01:00:58.785 --> 01:01:00.318
I don't know his name.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.188
I was walking home after
the movies last night.

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:05.356
He was closing up his store and

01:01:05.358 --> 01:01:07.459
asked if I needed a ride home.

01:01:07.761 --> 01:01:10.194
When I came closer, he grabbed me,

01:01:10.496 --> 01:01:12.863
put a cloth over my face.

01:01:12.865 --> 01:01:16.500
I passed out and woke
up here in his car.

01:01:16.502 --> 01:01:19.570
I was tied up in the back seat.

01:01:19.572 --> 01:01:21.972
And the engine was running.

01:01:22.175 --> 01:01:25.977
I thought I was gonna suffocate.

01:01:25.979 --> 01:01:28.947
But... but you didn't?

01:01:29.149 --> 01:01:31.949
Well, I'm talking
to you, aren't I?

01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:34.118
Aah!

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.187
Look, that man that kidnapped you,

01:01:36.189 --> 01:01:37.889
he's the reason that I'm
here, too,

01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:39.724
and my family

01:01:39.726 --> 01:01:41.793
and all the other girls
that were missing.

01:01:41.795 --> 01:01:43.961
He trapped us all in this house.

01:01:43.964 --> 01:01:45.963
He wants us to be asleep.

01:01:45.965 --> 01:01:47.832
That's how he controls us.

01:01:47.834 --> 01:01:49.367
Quiet.

01:01:52.204 --> 01:01:54.204
Are you coming?

01:01:57.277 --> 01:01:59.210
There's nothing out there.

01:01:59.212 --> 01:02:01.012
Well, I've got to get home.

01:02:01.414 --> 01:02:02.847
My family's worried about me.

01:02:02.849 --> 01:02:05.550
I've been gone all night.

01:02:05.552 --> 01:02:07.285
No, you've been gone much

01:02:07.287 --> 01:02:10.122
longer than that, Frances.

01:02:11.024 --> 01:02:14.260
Your family has already
grieved over you.

01:02:14.261 --> 01:02:17.295
Then, they moved on with
the rest of their lives.

01:02:17.797 --> 01:02:20.097
Grieved over me?

01:02:23.599 --> 01:02:28.799
You're wrong.
That can't be right.

01:02:29.308 --> 01:02:31.710
When I touched this,

01:02:31.712 --> 01:02:33.044
we connected.

01:02:33.646 --> 01:02:36.382
How did you get my ring?

01:02:37.384 --> 01:02:39.684
After he murdered you,

01:02:39.686 --> 01:02:42.020
he dumped your body 
down below.

01:02:42.022 --> 01:02:43.888
And then he burned you up...

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:47.225
Just like all the other girls.

01:02:47.227 --> 01:02:49.594
He was a monster.

01:02:49.696 --> 01:02:53.298
And I am so, so sorry that you

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.833
had to go through that, Frances.

01:02:54.835 --> 01:02:56.901
I really, really am.

01:02:57.003 --> 01:02:59.604
But you have to wake up.

01:02:59.606 --> 01:03:02.240
We all do.

01:03:18.042 --> 01:03:21.292
- Frances! No! 
- This is my house, Lisa!

01:03:24.698 --> 01:03:25.730
Lisa?

01:03:26.532 --> 01:03:30.201
Lisa, what are you
doing in here?

01:03:31.104 --> 01:03:33.705
You're supposed to be upstairs
in your room, resting.

01:03:35.976 --> 01:03:36.507
Lisa!

01:03:36.709 --> 01:03:38.076
I know what happened.

01:03:38.078 --> 01:03:40.011
Lisa, what are you doing?

01:03:40.613 --> 01:03:41.546
Where is it?

01:03:41.548 --> 01:03:42.680
Lisa, stop it!

01:03:42.682 --> 01:03:44.449
Sweetheart, talk to me.

01:03:44.451 --> 01:03:45.316
Lisa.

01:03:45.318 --> 01:03:48.319
It happened to us in the garage,
just like Frances and the others.

01:03:48.321 --> 01:03:49.087
Lisa, stop it.

01:03:49.089 --> 01:03:49.887
What happened?

01:03:49.889 --> 01:03:51.089
What are you talking about?

01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:53.724
Who's Frances?

01:03:55.362 --> 01:03:57.395
Oh, my God.

01:03:58.498 --> 01:04:01.200
It was dad.

01:04:04.137 --> 01:04:07.772
And you... you let him do this!

01:04:07.774 --> 01:04:09.540
What on earth are
you talking about?

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:11.409
You didn't even do
anything to save us!

01:04:11.411 --> 01:04:12.143
Lisa, talk to me.

01:04:12.345 --> 01:04:15.179
Wake up, mom! Wake up!

01:04:16.082 --> 01:04:18.950
I won't let it happen again.

01:04:18.952 --> 01:04:21.819
Never again!

01:04:47.344 --> 01:04:48.956
Robbie?

01:04:49.682 --> 01:04:51.307
Where's Edgar?

01:04:51.384 --> 01:04:52.984
He left.

01:04:52.986 --> 01:04:56.953
Robbie, you do understand
that me,

01:04:56.955 --> 01:04:59.859
you, and mom and dad 
aren't alive anymore...

01:04:59.984 --> 01:05:01.360
this isn't the real world?

01:05:01.361 --> 01:05:03.127
Mm-hmm.

01:05:03.129 --> 01:05:04.662
When did you figure that out?

01:05:04.664 --> 01:05:06.664
This morning...

01:05:07.066 --> 01:05:09.734
After I found my glasses.

01:05:09.736 --> 01:05:11.402
Your glasses?

01:05:11.404 --> 01:05:13.204
They were under my pillow.

01:05:13.406 --> 01:05:16.607
I didn't want to find them
before, 'cause I was too scared.

01:05:17.209 --> 01:05:20.211
Why would you be scared
of your glasses?

01:05:20.213 --> 01:05:22.611
'Cause I was wearing
them that night...

01:05:22.637 --> 01:05:24.649
the night we all died.

01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:27.418
Don't worry, Lisa,
it's gonna be okay.

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:28.953
We're just like pac-man.

01:05:28.955 --> 01:05:31.322
We play in the same maze 
over and over,

01:05:31.324 --> 01:05:32.623
and we can never die.

01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:36.494
We're always in our house, 
and that's just how it's got to be.

01:05:36.496 --> 01:05:39.531
That's what Edgar told me.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.237
Hi, Lisa.

01:08:17.323 --> 01:08:20.258
If you're watching this,
it means you made it back.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.326
Or it means I'm crazy.

01:08:22.328 --> 01:08:24.662
Either way, I hope
you find this.

01:08:24.663 --> 01:08:28.131
The one thing I do
know is I'm scared.

01:08:28.134 --> 01:08:30.600
The man who lived here 
before you,

01:08:30.602 --> 01:08:32.903
was named Edgar mullins.

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:35.673
He was born in this house.

01:08:35.675 --> 01:08:39.109
He murdered all those
girls over the years.

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:42.046
And then he died here in 1983.

01:08:42.348 --> 01:08:45.015
My dad... he's changed.

01:08:45.218 --> 01:08:49.252
My mom's useless...
totally in denial.

01:08:49.654 --> 01:08:52.790
No one will believe
a word I say.

01:08:53.392 --> 01:08:56.794
I found this in the
garage last week.

01:08:57.395 --> 01:09:00.029
It's how we connected.

01:09:00.032 --> 01:09:01.497
It's yours, isn't it?

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.569
It belonged to you
before you died.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:09.707
You're the only one who understands
what I'm going through.

01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:12.408
Help me, Lisa.

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:16.346
Help me save my family.

01:09:23.255 --> 01:09:24.322
Where are they?!

01:09:24.323 --> 01:09:25.122
David.

01:09:25.124 --> 01:09:27.791
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for?!

01:09:28.527 --> 01:09:31.127
Okay, I know what you're doing.

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:32.330
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:34.064
- Olivia? 
- Where are they?

01:09:34.066 --> 01:09:35.099
I'm scared.

01:09:35.201 --> 01:09:37.167
- Where did you put them?! 
- What?!

01:09:37.169 --> 01:09:39.469
- You know what I'm talking about!
- I don't.

01:09:40.639 --> 01:09:43.573
David, stop please. Just stop.

01:09:43.576 --> 01:09:44.742
Where did you hide them?

01:09:44.743 --> 01:09:46.644
I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:09:46.645 --> 01:09:48.446
- Right! 
- What's wrong with you?

01:09:48.448 --> 01:09:50.080
Why are you acting like this?!

01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:53.818
Olivia, go back to your room.

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:56.454
Take your sister with you.

01:09:57.156 --> 01:09:58.856
Olivia, please.

01:09:58.858 --> 01:10:00.491
Sweetheart.

01:10:00.993 --> 01:10:02.026
Go upstairs.

01:10:02.128 --> 01:10:05.429
Do as your mother says, Olivia.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:09.700
- You shouldn't be down here.
- No, no.

01:10:09.702 --> 01:10:10.801
Now, listen to me.

01:10:10.803 --> 01:10:11.936
Listen to me, okay?

01:10:11.938 --> 01:10:14.505
You need to get out
of this house.

01:10:14.507 --> 01:10:16.040
Take your kids with you and

01:10:16.042 --> 01:10:18.275
don't ever, ever come
back here again.

01:10:18.277 --> 01:10:19.410
Do you understand me?

01:10:19.412 --> 01:10:22.413
He is not your husband.

01:10:22.415 --> 01:10:24.715
She's, uh, confused.

01:10:25.217 --> 01:10:27.784
I think she was
sleepwalking again.

01:10:27.786 --> 01:10:28.919
He is lying to you.

01:10:28.921 --> 01:10:29.720
He is lying.

01:10:29.722 --> 01:10:31.989
He's taken over Olivia's father.

01:10:31.991 --> 01:10:34.158
Oh, I mean... God,
I mean my father.

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.092
Anne...

01:10:35.094 --> 01:10:36.961
You take care of Emily.

01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:40.598
I am going to take Olivia
upstairs to her room.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.465
No!

01:10:41.467 --> 01:10:42.700
It's all right, Olivia.

01:10:42.802 --> 01:10:44.768
It's me.

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:45.803
It's dad.

01:10:45.805 --> 01:10:47.705
No!

01:11:04.223 --> 01:11:05.990
Hey! Hey! Help!

01:11:06.092 --> 01:11:08.959
Help! Please call the police!

01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:11.528
Help!

01:11:11.553 --> 01:11:12.330
Help!

01:11:12.431 --> 01:11:14.631
Oh! Oh!

01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:24.809
Silly girl.

01:11:27.814 --> 01:11:30.381
Don't you know a ghost can

01:11:30.383 --> 01:11:32.249
never leave its house?

01:11:44.254 --> 01:11:45.370
<i>Lisa.</i>

01:11:45.895 --> 01:11:47.395
Lisa.

01:11:47.934 --> 01:11:51.268
Honey, wake up. It's okay.
Shhhh.

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:52.570
It's okay. It's okay.

01:11:52.572 --> 01:11:53.571
I'm right here.

01:11:53.873 --> 01:11:56.507
You've been out for a while...
a few hours.

01:11:57.109 --> 01:12:00.077
You collapsed on the front lawn.

01:12:00.079 --> 01:12:03.514
I thought that you were
sleepwalking again, but...

01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:05.616
you weren't, were you?

01:12:06.018 --> 01:12:11.155
I mean, how could any of
us be asleep, since...

01:12:11.557 --> 01:12:13.557
We're dead?

01:12:17.259 --> 01:12:21.759
I know.
I finally know.

01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:24.201
I've woken up, too.

01:12:24.203 --> 01:12:26.604
But how?

01:12:26.606 --> 01:12:29.640
You told me that I
didn't try to save us.

01:12:29.642 --> 01:12:33.077
But you were wrong.

01:12:33.379 --> 01:12:37.014
These are the clothes that have
been missing from the laundry.

01:12:37.616 --> 01:12:38.782
I packed them that night.

01:12:38.784 --> 01:12:40.717
They're yours and
mine and Robbie's.

01:12:40.719 --> 01:12:42.420
I was gonna sneak us out of 
the house

01:12:42.422 --> 01:12:45.890
in the middle of the night while
your father was asleep...

01:12:45.892 --> 01:12:49.293
'Cause I was afraid.

01:12:49.295 --> 01:12:53.197
I was afraid of
what he might do.

01:12:54.499 --> 01:12:58.271
We never made it out of the
house that night, did we?

01:13:01.374 --> 01:13:03.107
Have you talked to dad?

01:13:03.109 --> 01:13:05.476
No.

01:13:05.878 --> 01:13:10.047
He's in that garage as if
nothing ever happened.

01:13:10.049 --> 01:13:11.549
- I'll go talk to him.
- No!

01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:12.082
Mom.

01:13:12.084 --> 01:13:12.683
No.

01:13:12.685 --> 01:13:14.385
Mom, trust me.

01:13:14.787 --> 01:13:17.488
It's okay.

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:20.457
All of us are safe now,

01:13:20.459 --> 01:13:23.527
and the only thing left
for us to do is leave.

01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:27.600
Dad is the last one who
needs to understand that.

01:13:29.902 --> 01:13:34.305
You tried to tell
me again and again.

01:13:34.307 --> 01:13:37.975
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

01:13:41.046 --> 01:13:43.314
It's okay.

01:13:43.516 --> 01:13:45.282
I know what to do.

01:13:49.989 --> 01:13:51.021
Oh, hey, there, kiddo.

01:13:51.023 --> 01:13:52.022
How are you feeling?

01:13:52.324 --> 01:13:54.558
Where are the spark plugs, dad?

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:56.427
What do you mean?

01:13:56.429 --> 01:13:58.028
No one stole them.

01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:01.131
You lost them on purpose.

01:14:01.133 --> 01:14:03.000
Lisa, I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:14:03.002 --> 01:14:04.702
You hid them from yourself.

01:14:06.105 --> 01:14:07.204
All right.

01:14:07.606 --> 01:14:09.573
Why would I do that?

01:14:09.775 --> 01:14:12.343
Because you knew what
you were turning into.

01:14:12.345 --> 01:14:14.411
Now, where are they, dad?

01:14:14.613 --> 01:14:16.980
Deep down, you know.

01:14:40.474 --> 01:14:42.161
Take them out.

01:14:42.187 --> 01:14:43.266
Why?

01:14:57.512 --> 01:14:59.612
Do you feel anything?

01:14:59.637 --> 01:15:01.637
Not a thing.

01:15:02.461 --> 01:15:05.762
I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:15:06.164 --> 01:15:08.699
Put them back in the engine.

01:15:08.701 --> 01:15:11.468
All right, Lisa, I've had just
about enough of this nonsense.

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.671
The engine.

01:15:24.173 --> 01:15:25.557
Turn the key.

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:44.550
Dad?

01:15:45.276 --> 01:15:47.415
Do you remember?

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.809
Do you remember what
happened to us?

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.307
I used ether...

01:16:01.433 --> 01:16:03.005
On you...

01:16:04.657 --> 01:16:09.059
And Robbie and your...

01:16:09.061 --> 01:16:13.297
and your mom.

01:16:13.299 --> 01:16:17.835
And then I carried you...

01:16:18.237 --> 01:16:21.839
Downstairs into here...

01:16:21.841 --> 01:16:24.508
From your bedrooms.

01:16:26.412 --> 01:16:30.114
And then I...

01:16:32.151 --> 01:16:33.550
And then you did what?

01:16:33.752 --> 01:16:36.286
God.

01:16:36.588 --> 01:16:39.156
Oh, God.

01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:43.391
You and Robbie and mom...

01:16:43.393 --> 01:16:46.162
my whole family.

01:16:46.865 --> 01:16:49.566
What have I done?

01:16:49.568 --> 01:16:50.534
No.

01:16:50.536 --> 01:16:51.802
It wasn't you.

01:16:51.804 --> 01:16:53.337
Of course it was me!

01:16:53.339 --> 01:16:55.339
No, no, it was someone else.

01:16:55.341 --> 01:16:56.874
He got inside you.

01:16:56.876 --> 01:16:58.442
He did this to us.

01:16:58.844 --> 01:17:00.210
Who?

01:17:02.181 --> 01:17:03.180
Bruce!

01:17:03.182 --> 01:17:04.615
Bruce!

01:17:08.387 --> 01:17:10.120
Carol, I'm sorry.

01:17:10.122 --> 01:17:11.855
I'm so sorry.

01:17:11.857 --> 01:17:13.190
What's happening?

01:17:13.792 --> 01:17:17.360
We're awake... all of us.

01:17:18.597 --> 01:17:20.130
Mommy, where are you?!

01:17:20.132 --> 01:17:22.633
I'm right here.

01:17:33.642 --> 01:17:36.246
What's going on?

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:47.150
We need to get out of this
house.

01:17:55.864 --> 01:17:58.064
Mommy, the sun's out!

01:17:59.507 --> 01:18:01.042
Robbie!

01:18:06.144 --> 01:18:07.977
Carol!

01:18:10.702 --> 01:18:14.084
Carol! Robbie!

01:18:23.086 --> 01:18:26.286
It's all right, sweetheart.
We can leave.

01:18:30.499 --> 01:18:32.299
Lis?

01:18:41.738 --> 01:18:44.338
I love you, dad.

01:18:45.284 --> 01:18:47.518
I love all of you.

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.220
Lisa!

01:18:50.422 --> 01:18:52.355
Lis!

01:20:39.531 --> 01:20:42.630
Get out of my my house, Lisa.

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:13.940
<i>Where do you think
you're going, little butterfly?</i>

01:21:17.869 --> 01:21:20.605
<i>You cannot hide from
me in this house,</i>

01:21:20.607 --> 01:21:23.207
<i>and certainly not in
my own room.</i>

01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:26.643
<i>I don't need your
company anymore.</i>

01:21:26.645 --> 01:21:28.545
<i>I don't need your family's.</i>

01:21:28.547 --> 01:21:31.715
<i>I got a new one to add
to my collection.</i>

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.053
Olivia!

01:21:36.655 --> 01:21:39.522
Olivia, where are you?

01:21:39.524 --> 01:21:42.092
Olivia!

01:21:42.494 --> 01:21:44.494
Olivia, bring me back!

01:21:46.832 --> 01:21:49.399
Olivia!

01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:53.204
Olivia, open this
door right now!

01:21:54.806 --> 01:21:57.173
Olivia!

01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:03.275
Where are you, Olivia?

01:22:05.119 --> 01:22:07.452
Silly girl.

01:23:07.785 --> 01:23:08.797
I'm here.

01:23:08.813 --> 01:23:11.681
I've got your things, so
listen to me, all right?

01:23:11.683 --> 01:23:13.383
Wake up.

01:23:13.685 --> 01:23:16.153
All of you, wake up.

01:23:21.155 --> 01:23:25.930
We can send this bastard to hell,
but we have to do it together.

01:23:39.934 --> 01:23:42.634
Frances... Please.

01:23:43.959 --> 01:23:46.483
Please. Help me.

01:23:52.758 --> 01:23:55.692
No one can help you now, Lisa.

01:23:55.694 --> 01:23:59.563
Shh. 
Just go to sleep.

01:23:59.565 --> 01:24:01.565
Go to sleep, now.

01:26:15.867 --> 01:26:18.103
Hello, Lisa.

01:26:20.405 --> 01:26:24.007
You just won't let go
of Olivia, will you?

01:26:24.009 --> 01:26:26.476
Such a plucky girl.

01:26:26.878 --> 01:26:29.212
You know, you were the same way

01:26:29.214 --> 01:26:31.247
when you were alive.

01:26:31.549 --> 01:26:34.517
Trying to save your family from
me,

01:26:34.619 --> 01:26:37.687
trying to fight the tide.

01:26:37.689 --> 01:26:40.890
And yet here we are,
the two of us,

01:26:41.492 --> 01:26:44.227
and it ends the same.

01:26:47.799 --> 01:26:51.468
History doesn't repeat itself.

01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:53.303
It rhymes.

01:26:58.409 --> 01:27:00.977
Time for you to go, Lisa.

01:27:51.254 --> 01:27:54.854
Go ahead, step across.

01:27:55.567 --> 01:27:58.067
Your home is gone.

01:27:58.169 --> 01:28:00.703
Your time is gone.

01:28:00.705 --> 01:28:03.072
There's nothing left for you 
but oblivion...

01:28:03.274 --> 01:28:05.474
a place
worse than death.

01:28:05.476 --> 01:28:06.375
I don't care.

01:28:06.377 --> 01:28:08.645
You can send me wherever the
hell you want, but you're not

01:28:08.647 --> 01:28:10.213
killing this family tonight.

01:28:10.515 --> 01:28:11.882
You can't get the keys,

01:28:11.884 --> 01:28:14.552
so you can't start the car.

01:28:18.156 --> 01:28:21.991
Olivia's father leaves the
spare on the workbench.

01:28:26.531 --> 01:28:28.065
No!

01:28:28.467 --> 01:28:30.367
No!

01:28:31.169 --> 01:28:34.337
I always do enjoy killing you.

01:29:57.933 --> 01:30:00.133
Goodbye, Edgar.

01:30:06.058 --> 01:30:08.112
Aaaaaah!

01:30:15.137 --> 01:30:19.137
Aaaaaah!

01:30:34.118 --> 01:30:35.418
Olivia?

01:30:37.596 --> 01:30:40.163
What happened?

01:30:46.365 --> 01:30:50.865
- I'm so sorry, Olivia.
- It's okay, dad.

01:30:54.012 --> 01:30:57.647
We're gonna be a
happy family again.

01:31:16.949 --> 01:31:19.549
Have a good life, Olivia.

01:31:47.222 --> 01:31:48.406
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

01:31:48.967 --> 01:31:50.500
<i>Lisa, wake up.</i>

01:31:50.902 --> 01:31:53.803
<i>Lisa, I found the pirate
treasure.</i>

01:31:53.855 --> 01:31:55.621
<i>We're gonna be rich.</i>

01:31:55.623 --> 01:31:58.357
<i>Come downstairs so I can
give you your share.</i>

01:31:58.359 --> 01:31:59.325
<i>Hurry.</i>

01:32:00.011 --> 01:32:02.345
<i>It's your birthday present.</i>

01:32:02.347 --> 01:32:04.747
<i>Happy Birthday, Lisa.</i>

01:32:36.355 --> 01:32:39.155
Happy 16, sweetheart.

01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:42.180
Dad?

01:32:42.587 --> 01:32:43.752
Mom?

01:32:43.754 --> 01:32:45.688
Where are we?

01:32:45.690 --> 01:32:48.124
We're home, honey.

01:32:48.126 --> 01:32:50.593
We're finally home.

01:32:56.331 --> 01:32:58.521
You want to take it for a spin?

01:32:58.647 --> 01:33:02.738
Will you come back for some
cake and pirate treasure, Lisa?

01:33:13.412 --> 01:33:15.812
What's out there?

01:33:20.691 --> 01:33:23.490
Whatever you want there to be.

01:34:01.423 --> 01:34:03.123
