For a hundred years,

00:20.020 --> 00:23.108
one company has worked
with unparalleled vision

00:23.110 --> 00:26.188
toward the continued
safety of our great nation:

00:26.190 --> 00:28.118
Ammotech.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.208
First, we changed the game
with the chain-fed machine gun,

00:31.210 --> 00:35.028
as well as Claymore landmines.

00:35.030 --> 00:36.148
Next we taught those Krauts

00:36.150 --> 00:38.148
about another great American pastime:

00:38.150 --> 00:40.058
the barbecue.

00:40.060 --> 00:41.148
Ammotech.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.188
The world's leading innovator

00:43.190 --> 00:45.190
of weapons of mass protection.

Clarence! Hey, listen, I'm super late

01:25.090 --> 01:26.128
and can't find my gate pass anywhere.

01:26.130 --> 01:29.108
I was hoping you could
just do me a favor and...

01:29.110 --> 01:32.178
- I gotta have that pass.
- Yeah. Of course.

01:32.180 --> 01:35.068
Gate pass.
Gate pass. Gate pass.

01:35.070 --> 01:37.208
Yeah, I got it. I got it. Uh...

01:37.210 --> 01:40.018
The thing is, Clarence, I'm a
little disorganized this morning.

01:40.020 --> 01:43.028
- I see, and
- and it's heartbreaking.

01:43.030 --> 01:44.218
I got you a card on
your birthday, remember?

01:44.220 --> 01:47.058
It had a cupcake running away
from a shitload of candles.

01:47.060 --> 01:50.038
- Look, no pass, no entry. At least without TW
- 100 clearance form.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.168
Dude, don't make me fill
out that one giant form...

01:52.170 --> 01:55.228
No access to the premises without valid ID.

01:55.230 --> 01:57.118
- Prohibited.
- Thanks, Clarence.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.130
Next birthday, no card.

02:10.060 --> 02:13.028
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:13.030 --> 02:14.188
Oh. Hey. Brimble. Accounting.

02:14.190 --> 02:16.120
- Accounting.
- Yeah. I know.

02:17.190 --> 02:19.180
Okay. Thanks, Tony.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.198
Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.058
Door is open.

02:27.060 --> 02:29.158
- Dezzy Des.
- Sammy Sam.

02:29.160 --> 02:33.038
Once again fighting a
losing battle with Mondays.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.198
Once again busting my balls.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.058
Well, somebody has to do it. You
haven't been on time for anything since...

02:38.220 --> 02:40.158
- ...ever
- Not true.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.158
2012. NYU. Totally on time
for your graduation ceremony.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.138
After you went out the
night before and got so drunk

02:45.140 --> 02:47.038
that you puked during my speech.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.120
Don't take that as a criticism.
It was a brilliant speech.

02:50.130 --> 02:52.028
Ever think that maybe my problem here

02:52.030 --> 02:54.038
is that I'm just not being
properly incentivized?

02:54.040 --> 02:56.180
Of course you are. You get
to hang out with me every day.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.038
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.050
So you can at least try to be on time.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.198
Uh, thanks.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.040
My gift to you.

03:15.140 --> 03:17.098
Helen, I'll need to remain undisturbed

03:17.100 --> 03:18.998
throughout my meetings today.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.150
Also, excellently tidy workspace.

03:25.050 --> 03:26.080
Love the lipstick.

03:28.050 --> 03:30.130
I'll take my green juice in five minutes.

03:46.070 --> 03:48.058
- Hello?
- Good morning, Desmond.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.088
Step into my office, please.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.150
Sure thing, Mr. Nusbaum.

04:00.210 --> 04:03.018
Helen, hi. No, no, no. Please don't get up.

04:03.020 --> 04:05.118
Don't get up. Don't get... Oh.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.070
Really, I could get the door myself if...

04:11.150 --> 04:13.188
You know, it's really not the
assistant's job to do that.

04:13.190 --> 04:15.000
Anymore.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.058
That's very kind of you, and thank you.

04:19.060 --> 04:22.029
Thanks for walking me.
That was great. Thank you.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.150
- Morning.
- You're late.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.128
Uh, yeah. I ran into some
trouble at the guard gate and...

04:30.130 --> 04:32.088
Yes, I've noticed that tardiness is

04:32.090 --> 04:33.178
a recurring motif in your life,

04:33.180 --> 04:35.178
- but actually I don't care.
- Hmm.

04:35.180 --> 04:37.148
I've called you in here
regarding the merger.

04:37.150 --> 04:38.158
- Merger?
- Yes.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.118
Merger, as in to merge,

04:40.120 --> 04:43.028
connect, conjoin, couple or harness.

04:43.030 --> 04:45.018
- Who are we merger
- ing with?

04:45.020 --> 04:47.018
- Altria.
- The cluster bomb guys.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.128
No, that would be Benevolencia.

04:48.130 --> 04:50.028
Altria makes the VX gas,

04:50.030 --> 04:51.140
weaponized anthrax, and of course...

04:53.060 --> 04:54.130
the all-terrain jet ski.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.118
Boy, they've had a great year.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.078
We might get a leg up
on them if we develop

04:59.080 --> 05:02.130
an all-terrain jet ski that
shoots weaponized anthrax.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.168
- Possible. I'll e
- mail Development.

05:07.170 --> 05:10.218
By the by, R and D has
been banging down my door

05:10.220 --> 05:12.198
regarding the Clayton report.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.220
Now, what is the ETA on that exactly?

05:16.060 --> 05:17.080
On its way.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.148
Excellent. Well, whichever
of those is your best foot,

05:23.150 --> 05:25.128
I suggest you put it forward, Desmond,

05:25.130 --> 05:27.168
because I can assure you that not all of us

05:27.170 --> 05:29.150
are going to be here
at the end of the week.

05:31.220 --> 05:33.020
Goodbye.

05:40.030 --> 05:41.118
Desmond.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.090
Psst.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.070
Desmond.

05:51.030 --> 05:52.158
You get fired or what?

05:52.160 --> 05:54.148
Not as far as I know.

05:54.150 --> 05:56.120
I got a cousin at Altria.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.200
They already laid off half
of their accounting staff.

06:00.190 --> 06:03.168
You know what that means.
Half of us are going, too.

06:03.170 --> 06:06.008
It's already started.

06:06.010 --> 06:09.178
Meg's desk is empty. Heard
she got axed last night.

06:09.180 --> 06:12.138
Worst part. Her severance package:

06:12.140 --> 06:14.008
an Ammotech T-shirt.

06:14.010 --> 06:16.108
- A fucking T
- shirt?

06:16.110 --> 06:17.228
My Uncle Usef warned me about this.

06:17.230 --> 06:21.108
He said America is nothing
but downsizing, heart disease,

06:21.110 --> 06:25.038
and billboards that give you an
unnatural desire for white women.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.088
- Why did I not listen?
- Why did I not listen?

06:27.090 --> 06:29.068
- I keep saying that to myself.
- I was told not to work here.

06:29.070 --> 06:31.140
Guys. Hey!

06:32.210 --> 06:34.068
Relax, okay.

06:34.070 --> 06:35.198
We don't know for sure,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.158
so let's just assume
everything's gonna be fine,

06:37.160 --> 06:40.048
and hey, if it does happen,
you know what they say:

06:40.050 --> 06:41.190
When one door opens, another door closes.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.210
What?

06:44.230 --> 06:46.008
I got that backwards. When one door...

06:46.010 --> 06:47.188
See you, bitches.

06:47.190 --> 06:49.088
Hey, Lentworth.

06:49.090 --> 06:52.058
No offense, but... but
you're really fucking old,

06:52.060 --> 06:54.028
and nobody really knows
what you do here anyway,

06:54.030 --> 06:56.118
so if anyone's gonna go, it's gonna be you

06:56.120 --> 06:58.048
or Johnny Jihadi over here.

06:58.050 --> 07:02.138
Marcus, the racist,
moronic statements you're making

07:02.140 --> 07:04.048
are no match for the wall of serenity

07:04.050 --> 07:05.138
I've created around myself.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.088
You know what I really miss, Mohammed?

07:07.090 --> 07:09.008
Wearing my shoes at the airport.

07:09.010 --> 07:11.128
One, uh, my name is Mourad, okay.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.128
And two, I grew up in Jakarta,

07:13.130 --> 07:15.018
which is a long way from the Middle East,

07:15.020 --> 07:16.208
- and three, for the billionth...
- You're a pacifist,

07:16.210 --> 07:18.178
one who just happens to
work at a weapons company.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.178
- Come on.
- I have student loans.

07:20.180 --> 07:23.098
Yeah, whatever. If the ax is gonna fall,

07:23.100 --> 07:25.088
it's gonna fall on one of you bitches.

07:25.090 --> 07:28.088
Now, me, I'm co-deputy regional manager.

07:28.090 --> 07:29.998
I'll probably be promoted.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.228
Well, it helps that
you're Mr. Gantt's nephew,

07:31.230 --> 07:34.170
That's true. So who's it gonna be?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.058
Well, I...

07:38.060 --> 07:41.008
I can't get fired. I got
a... I got a mortgage,

07:41.010 --> 07:43.208
alimony, two kids in college.

07:43.210 --> 07:46.068
Viagra's a fortune. Oh, God.

07:46.070 --> 07:47.130
I'm so screwed.

07:48.130 --> 07:51.188
I am so screwed.

07:51.190 --> 07:54.158
See, what you need to
do is you just grab a key

07:54.160 --> 07:57.058
and you stab someone's
ass to death with it.

07:58.090 --> 08:00.198
That's the only way
you're gonna keep a job.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.998
Make a choice.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.048
Lentworth.

08:03.050 --> 08:06.050
- Step into my office, please.
- Ooh, too late.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.198
I think my old boss
is still at Fishsticks.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.170
- I can still make fish.
- Good luck.

08:38.090 --> 08:41.068
Dr. Frohm. Line 1.

08:41.070 --> 08:43.188
Hey, Mr. Corn to Sean Penis.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.028
- Hello?
- It's Dr. Frohm.

08:45.030 --> 08:47.130
Get your ass down to R and D right now.

08:53.180 --> 08:55.170
How to survive
a day at Ammotech.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.098
One. Always have a clipboard in hand.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.028
The busier you look, the
more invisible you become.

09:02.030 --> 09:04.028
- Hey, Des, uh...
- Step two.

09:04.030 --> 09:07.018
If you get cornered, know the lingo.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.078
Desmond!

09:08.080 --> 09:11.008
We got a problem with our
purchase orders over in R and D.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.038
I can totally get you
those CPCs. Just draft an RFP

09:13.040 --> 09:15.208
and we can reconvene
AEOD for some THC. Cool?

09:15.210 --> 09:17.038
Sure.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.050
THC?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.218
All right, let's start
pissing brain juice.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.088
Sloganball time. Maxwell.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.228
- The M26 Mega
- Taser.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.028
50,000 volts of stopping power.

09:26.030 --> 09:28.108
Nice slogan. Sloganize me, Bertrand.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.208
Uh, M26. It will zap until you crap.

09:31.210 --> 09:32.228
- Yeah.
- Hear! Hear!

09:32.230 --> 09:34.158
Three. When
others try to pull you in,

09:34.160 --> 09:35.208
do not give them anything useful

09:35.210 --> 09:37.168
or they'll expect it every time.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.210
Desmond!

09:40.110 --> 09:42.028
Sloganize me.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.188
Uh, sure.

09:45.090 --> 09:47.028
The M26 Mega-Taser.

09:47.030 --> 09:48.130
A lot more gentle than a Glock.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.178
- I don't...
- Yes.

09:52.180 --> 09:55.078
- It's kinda medium.
- Good try, man.

09:55.080 --> 09:58.088
Not the best idea I've
ever heard, but okay.

09:58.090 --> 10:00.118
Go back to the mailroom, you loser.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.028
- It's a bad idea.
- Unless you want me to hire this moron,

10:03.030 --> 10:04.188
start coming up with real ideas.

10:04.190 --> 10:06.108
Four.

10:06.110 --> 10:08.118
Remember, the higher the office,

10:08.120 --> 10:09.150
the bigger the douchebag.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.108
Take the sales dudes for example.

10:19.110 --> 10:22.030
- The V
- 22 will turn that target into toothpaste.

10:22.190 --> 10:25.038
Very good choice, my friend. See you soon.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.218
Boom! I just fucked that clown in the ass.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.998
What's up, Hofnagle? Let me
show you how I just did that.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.018
USA! USA!

10:32.020 --> 10:33.998
America! Woo!

10:34.000 --> 10:35.090
This is what winning feels like.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.088
At Ammotech,

10:38.090 --> 10:40.088
we make weapons of mass protection.

10:40.090 --> 10:42.108
Five. When processing orders,

10:42.110 --> 10:45.128
remember, you are the one in power.

10:45.130 --> 10:48.018
Does it really take this long

10:48.020 --> 10:50.108
to get an order processed by you, Desmond?

10:50.110 --> 10:51.228
It's been over a month,
and I still don't have

10:51.230 --> 10:53.218
that boron silicate hydroxide I want.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.188
When did we, uh, get the robot?

10:56.190 --> 10:58.068
Robots don't have people in them.

10:58.070 --> 11:00.098
This is an XL-9 Patrol Suit.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.078
One of six fully operational models.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.060
First-ever green tech.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.200
Runs solely on organic material.

11:07.140 --> 11:09.098
So when people think
Ammotech, they'll think,

11:09.100 --> 11:10.140
"Friend to the environment."

11:11.130 --> 11:13.228
Oh, I don't care about the environment.

11:13.230 --> 11:17.058
What I do care about is that
if we're up in the Afghan hills

11:17.060 --> 11:19.208
and this thing runs out of gas,
I can just grab an armadillo,

11:19.210 --> 11:23.108
throw it in the back, and continue
to rain hell down on the hajjis.

11:23.110 --> 11:26.188
Actually, armadillos are only
found in Central and North America.

11:26.190 --> 11:28.078
I did a paper on them in high school.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.998
And did you know they can hold
their breath for up to six minutes?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.080
I give zero fucks about
what you're saying right now.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.208
I want those purchase orders double-timed.

11:36.210 --> 11:38.028
Do you understand me?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.150
They're vital to a product
that we are working on.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.110
Got it?

11:44.230 --> 11:45.190
Great. Thanks, bud.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.078
Oh, um, I wouldn't stand
there if I were you.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.110
Why?

12:04.150 --> 12:05.140
Oh, shit.

12:08.180 --> 12:10.038
What?

12:10.040 --> 12:12.058
I didn't have
an official number for this,

12:12.060 --> 12:14.008
but I just thought of it
and it's pretty important,

12:14.010 --> 12:15.158
so let's call it 5B.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.208
If someone's a dick, you have the option

12:17.210 --> 12:19.118
of making their life hell

12:19.120 --> 12:21.138
with your hidden accounting superpower:

12:21.140 --> 12:23.118
Losing the paperwork.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.058
- I said it's not ready.
- Look,

12:25.060 --> 12:27.178
you're not in charge and it's not your job.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.008
Do you understand?

12:31.140 --> 12:33.108
What are you looking at, fucknuts?

12:33.110 --> 12:34.110
Get that order in.

12:36.010 --> 12:37.030
Sure thing, Doc.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.118
Six.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.198
To minimize job stress,

12:41.200 --> 12:43.128
practice your breathing techniques.

12:56.080 --> 13:00.018
Anyway... they shot
a pig with the mech suit

13:00.020 --> 13:01.070
and now I'm, like...

13:02.170 --> 13:04.028
wearing some of it.

13:07.130 --> 13:09.198
I thought that was a
design on your shirt.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.058
I'm okay.

13:12.060 --> 13:13.070
I'm okay.

13:18.180 --> 13:19.200
To being newly...

13:20.110 --> 13:22.048
...unemployed.

13:22.050 --> 13:23.168
Yeah!

13:23.170 --> 13:25.038
Fuck this place, man.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.130
My God, this guy.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.148
This bring
us to our final entry,

13:42.150 --> 13:43.218
number seven.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.220
Work on your own shit at work.

13:50.110 --> 13:53.058
Every one of us could
get shitcanned tomorrow,

13:53.060 --> 13:55.208
so spend a little time
working on your fallback plan.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.178
William Faulkner wrote one of his books

13:57.180 --> 13:59.078
using a wheelbarrow as a desk

13:59.080 --> 14:01.188
while working on some graveyard shift.

14:01.190 --> 14:05.038
Me, I've been designing a video game app.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.178
Basically a continuous runner

14:06.180 --> 14:08.198
where a guy who is stoned,
and remains stoned,

14:08.200 --> 14:10.218
is looking for munchies,
and if he reaches the end,

14:10.220 --> 14:12.078
him and his girlfriend...

14:12.080 --> 14:13.030
You know what?

14:13.230 --> 14:15.088
I shouldn't be pitching it right now.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.040
It's still in the design stage.

14:23.150 --> 14:26.048
Accounting. Hope you're having
a blessed day. How may I help you?

14:26.050 --> 14:28.020
This is
Adam Nusbaum speaking.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.128
I've just now noticed
the sign on my door reads

14:31.130 --> 14:33.158
A. Nusbaum.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.150
Why did no one bring
this to my attention?

14:41.190 --> 14:44.198
Desmond, I assure you
this would be a lot funnier

14:44.200 --> 14:47.150
if your voice even remotely
resembled Mr. Nusbaum's.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.098
I think
you're working way too hard.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.090
Take a moment and kick back.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.168
- Jesus.
- I'm hungry.

14:58.170 --> 15:00.098
Are you hungry? We should order pizza.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.188
I'd very much like to do my work.

15:01.190 --> 15:04.998
We'll split one. In honor
of this shitty day, I'll buy.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.108
Okay, you can't do that.

15:06.110 --> 15:08.068
Employees can no longer
make outgoing calls.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.228
- Do you ever read any e-mails?
- What?

15:09.230 --> 15:12.038
- Call center. How can I help you?
- Hi.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.168
Why do you exist?

15:15.170 --> 15:17.008
Excuse me?

15:17.010 --> 15:18.228
Why do I have to go through
you to call out somewhere?

15:18.230 --> 15:21.128
Due to the number of personal
calls made on company time,

15:21.130 --> 15:23.148
we've been put in as
a cost-cutting measure.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.098
Oh. In order to cut costs,

15:25.100 --> 15:26.208
they created a brand-new department?

15:26.210 --> 15:27.228
Yes.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.998
- Can I order a pizza?
- No.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Have a nice day.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.098
- This is an outrage.
- Will you stop, okay.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.088
Seriously. Listen, I know you don't care

15:37.090 --> 15:39.078
if you lose this job, but I do.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.078
Okay? If you hate this
place so much, just quit.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.020
Let someone else who
wants a job keep theirs.

15:46.130 --> 15:48.038
I don't want to lose my job.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.158
This is the best job in the world.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.008
Look, I get all the free
coffee I can consume,

15:53.010 --> 15:55.058
full health and dental, and
I get to work on my game.

15:55.060 --> 15:57.998
- Oh, Stoner Snatch?
- That was the working title,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.998
but it's now Bake... and Take.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.218
You've been working
on it for three years.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.168
And it shows, brother. It shows.

16:04.170 --> 16:06.068
I mean, the detail,
Mo. I mean, seriously...

16:06.070 --> 16:08.200
Oh, I think you stay
for a different reason.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.140
- Wendy?
- No.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.198
"Dezzy Des. Sammy Sam."

16:15.200 --> 16:18.220
Samantha?

16:19.210 --> 16:22.020
Please.

16:25.090 --> 16:28.028
Dude, we grew up
together. She's my homie.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.208
And besides, we have a deal.

16:29.210 --> 16:31.108
Oh, what's the deal?

16:31.110 --> 16:32.198
I'm bad with relationships,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.160
so why risk ruining a good friendship?

16:35.210 --> 16:38.088
Okay, but don't you want sex?

16:38.090 --> 16:40.028
I have sex.

16:40.030 --> 16:41.218
How? You're not in a relationship.

16:41.220 --> 16:44.120
I have sex with women I'm
not in a relationship with.

16:45.190 --> 16:47.198
God, I wish I had your face.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.100
- What?
- Nothing.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.000
Never mind. Go... fix your hair.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.138
Would everyone please report

16:57.140 --> 16:59.168
to the 4:00 p.m. motivational seminar?

16:59.170 --> 17:01.178
- Thank you.
- Get up.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.178
I heard your department
was a slaughterhouse today?

17:04.180 --> 17:06.048
Don't worry. I dodged the meat grinder.

17:06.050 --> 17:08.117
Desmond Brimble shall live
to mail it in another day.

17:08.119 --> 17:12.127
Okay, can you just listen
like an adult for ten seconds?

17:12.130 --> 17:13.198
Okay.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.078
I know you'd rather be playing Mario Kart,

17:16.079 --> 17:18.117
but if you get fired,
that makes me look bad.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.208
So do me a favor, okay.

17:20.210 --> 17:23.157
No more fucking up.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.140
You got it. No
more fuck-up-ery.

17:28.060 --> 17:30.108
I'm setting an alarm as a little reminder

17:30.110 --> 17:32.008
to come by my office tomorrow

17:32.010 --> 17:35.078
and tell me how impressed
Nusbaum is with your report!

17:35.080 --> 17:36.198
Count on it.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.218
Ladies and gentlemen...

17:38.220 --> 17:40.108
- it is my great honor...
- Love you, Des.

17:40.110 --> 17:43.088
...to introduce Ammotech CEO

17:43.090 --> 17:44.998
Franklin Gantt.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.158
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.118
I know many of you are asking yourselves...

17:56.120 --> 17:58.048
Why are we having a motivational seminar

17:58.050 --> 18:00.008
when we're laying off 40
percent of our workforce?

18:00.010 --> 18:03.078
...the best defense
manufacturer on the planet,

18:03.080 --> 18:05.148
and I say to you, you are...

18:05.150 --> 18:07.068
- I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

18:07.070 --> 18:09.128
I have a report to
finish. Start, actually.

18:09.130 --> 18:12.068
Don't leave us here with
these people, man. Fuck.

18:12.070 --> 18:14.030
...our history of great products.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.228
And now, onto our newest product,

18:17.230 --> 18:22.058
Zolt, it will awaken the warrior within.

18:22.060 --> 18:25.098
But first things first. Who's thirsty?

18:38.020 --> 18:39.218
Hey, go, go, go, go!

18:39.220 --> 18:41.128
Oh, Sam!

18:41.130 --> 18:43.068
Sam!

18:43.070 --> 18:45.188
Des, what up?

18:45.190 --> 18:48.118
Whoa, you're off early. What,
did you finally quit, hmm?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.218
No. Actually, I recommitted myself to it.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.068
Yeah, right.

18:53.070 --> 18:55.068
Well, someone's gotta
pay the rent around here.

18:55.070 --> 18:57.208
I told you, I will pay rent

18:57.210 --> 18:59.178
once my lawsuit check comes in.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.008
Those fucks at the
Make-A-Wish Foundation

19:02.010 --> 19:03.108
cannot hide from me.

19:03.110 --> 19:05.120
Always fighting the good fight, Fred.

19:09.020 --> 19:11.168
Hey, come play Mario Kart with us.

19:11.170 --> 19:13.198
Dude, I'm telling you, I got
a report due in the morning,

19:13.200 --> 19:16.138
I've been putting it off
all week, I gotta focus.

19:16.140 --> 19:18.168
Get your ass up
and quit being a pussy.

19:18.170 --> 19:20.098
- Let's go.
- Yeah, you're being a pussy.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.128
Pussies are tough, Freddy.

19:21.130 --> 19:22.218
They can take a pummeling and spit out

19:22.220 --> 19:24.070
an entirely new human being.

19:25.220 --> 19:28.060
- Never thought of it like that.
- That's weird.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.188
We'll see you outside, huh?

19:33.030 --> 19:35.068
Nope. Not gonna happen.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.128
Come on. Let's go out back.

19:52.180 --> 19:53.228
Battle mode!

19:55.030 --> 19:56.178
Hang on, bud.

19:56.180 --> 19:58.188
Pussy! Pussy!

19:58.190 --> 20:01.138
Tell me this is not the
greatest Tuesday ever!

20:01.140 --> 20:02.228
It's Monday. What the fuck?

20:02.230 --> 20:04.158
Who gives a shit, bitch?

20:07.150 --> 20:09.158
Move your fucking ass, Luigi!

20:09.160 --> 20:11.138
Losing is not an option!

20:11.140 --> 20:13.150
- Oh, shit!
- You son of a bitch!

20:28.130 --> 20:29.228
No.

20:29.230 --> 20:32.048
No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No. No.

20:32.050 --> 20:35.150
No. No! Fuck!

20:42.200 --> 20:44.160
Pass...

20:45.170 --> 20:47.210
Gate pass, gate pass, gate pass, gate pass.

21:10.210 --> 21:12.148
Brimble. Accounting.

21:12.150 --> 21:13.170
Thanks, Tony.

21:36.150 --> 21:39.058
- Hello?
- Brimble. My office.

21:39.060 --> 21:41.010
- Now.
- Sure thing, Mr. Nusbaum.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.208
What is that stuff? I saw
them making it down in R and D.

22:18.210 --> 22:21.168
I heard a report on
the news today, Desmond,

22:21.170 --> 22:24.158
about villagers in Africa who are so poor

22:24.160 --> 22:26.168
that they have resorted to eating pancakes

22:26.170 --> 22:27.998
made of fried dirt.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.098
Have you heard about this?

22:30.100 --> 22:32.038
I missed that one.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.188
Dirt, Desmond,

22:33.190 --> 22:36.038
fried... dirt, and it got me thinking.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.120
Do you know who has a lot of dirt?

22:39.040 --> 22:40.020
We do.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.138
We could make our own
pancakes out of fried dirt,

22:43.140 --> 22:46.088
export them to these poor, poor people

22:46.090 --> 22:48.198
for pennies on the dollar...

22:48.200 --> 22:51.010
...and get a great
contract with the Red Cross.

23:03.180 --> 23:05.148
Whoa!

23:05.150 --> 23:07.220
- That's...
- Was Jerry Solomon.

23:09.060 --> 23:11.088
Decent supervisor, but unfortunately,

23:11.090 --> 23:13.158
his weight indicated a certain lack

23:13.160 --> 23:15.028
of impulse control.

23:15.030 --> 23:16.168
Did you know that type II diabetes

23:16.170 --> 23:19.018
is one of the biggest drains
on corporate healthcare?

23:19.020 --> 23:21.108
Also, his spelling was atrocious.

23:21.110 --> 23:24.198
- Uh...
- Errors everywhere.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.138
He had to go.

23:27.140 --> 23:30.008
- Uh, I... I should...
- Let me read your report.

23:30.010 --> 23:32.018
I think I need a little more time.

23:42.090 --> 23:45.088
Paragraph three. You
make very creative use

23:45.090 --> 23:46.150
of the word...

23:51.000 --> 23:52.120
"whom."

23:53.130 --> 23:54.130
"Whom?"

23:55.080 --> 23:56.218
As in the objective in relation

23:56.220 --> 24:00.098
to the subjective pronoun "who."

24:00.100 --> 24:02.168
Right, i.e., "With whom are
you going to the movies?"

24:02.170 --> 24:05.008
- E.g.!
- What?

24:05.010 --> 24:08.228
E.g., Brimble, not i.e.

24:08.230 --> 24:12.098
I.e. means id est, which
is Latin for "in other words."

24:12.100 --> 24:14.218
E.g. means exempli gratia,

24:14.220 --> 24:17.168
which is Latin for "for example."

24:17.170 --> 24:19.138
Why is this so hard to understand?

24:19.140 --> 24:23.028
This is not
f-f-f-f...

24:23.030 --> 24:25.188
...fucking string theory!

24:25.190 --> 24:27.058
I get it. I get it. Reread it.

24:27.060 --> 24:30.108
It says, "With whom does
our company compete?"

24:30.110 --> 24:31.170
That's correct, yeah?

24:36.040 --> 24:37.090
My mistake.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.210
- Thank you.
- Except...

24:41.180 --> 24:43.998
you did spell my name incorrectly.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.178
What? N-U-S-B... What?
- So, Desmond.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.178
I can't have... What the fuck are you talking about?

24:48.180 --> 24:50.218
I'm afraid that we're
going to have to let you go.

24:50.220 --> 24:53.028
No, no, no, no!

24:55.090 --> 24:57.208
Desmond, don't be too sad.

24:57.210 --> 25:00.110
We do have a killer severance package.

25:03.020 --> 25:05.140
Oh, shit! Oh!

25:23.210 --> 25:25.078
What the fuck?

25:25.080 --> 25:26.168
Carter.

25:26.170 --> 25:28.158
You have any idea what the hell's going on?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.208
- We gotta get out of here.
- Go away.

25:30.210 --> 25:32.000
I'm working!

25:37.130 --> 25:39.008
Okay. I'm gone.

25:39.010 --> 25:40.210
Just keep pounding away and I'll...

25:46.170 --> 25:50.200
- I didn't have that saved.
- Oh.

25:51.220 --> 25:53.040
That's terrible, man.

25:54.070 --> 25:56.148
Maybe we could, um, check autosave?

25:56.150 --> 25:57.188
Might be a backup somewhere?

25:57.190 --> 25:59.228
Forget it. I'll retype it for you.

25:59.230 --> 26:01.030
No, no, no, no! Don't!

26:13.030 --> 26:15.150
Are you okay? Oh, shit.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.118
Carter, wait!

26:42.090 --> 26:44.038
Ammotech. How may I direct your call?

26:44.040 --> 26:45.138
Help me.
They're trying to kill me.

26:45.140 --> 26:46.228
Put me through to 911.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.178
Where are you calling from, sir?

26:48.180 --> 26:50.158
I'm in a safe place.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.218
- Now put me through to the cops.
- One moment, sir.

26:52.220 --> 26:54.158
Just let me check with my supervisor.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.068
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

26:56.070 --> 26:58.058
I'm stuck on the fourth
floor with a bunch of psychos.

26:58.060 --> 26:59.218
They got a hold of this green
shit that was not really...

26:59.220 --> 27:02.048
Sir, company policy prohibits

27:02.050 --> 27:04.108
any outside calls without
appropriate clearance.

27:04.110 --> 27:06.138
You don't need to check with
anyone. Just fucking do it.

27:06.140 --> 27:09.088
Sir, company policy
prohibits abusive language.

27:09.090 --> 27:11.188
If you'll consult the employee
manuals, it's all right there.

27:11.190 --> 27:14.138
Okay, I'm sorry. Please, just
do whatever it is you need to do,

27:14.140 --> 27:16.038
- then put me through to the cops.
- Sir, company policy...

27:16.040 --> 27:17.058
Shut the fuck up!

27:43.060 --> 27:44.220
We need catchphrases! Hit me!

27:45.210 --> 27:46.230
Hit me!

27:48.000 --> 27:49.178
Zolt. You'll like it,

27:49.180 --> 27:52.078
or I'll rip out your fucking spine!

27:53.140 --> 27:55.078
Beautiful. Give it to me.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.028
Zolt! You will like it,

27:57.030 --> 27:59.098
or I will barbecue your children

27:59.100 --> 28:02.138
while sodomizing the family dog!

28:02.140 --> 28:04.110
I like it!

28:08.220 --> 28:10.998
Decapitation's the way to go, guys.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.208
Lucky bastard probably
didn't even feel a thing.

28:13.210 --> 28:16.008
Desmond!

28:17.210 --> 28:19.168
Sloganize me.

28:19.170 --> 28:22.128
Sloganize. Sloganize.

28:22.130 --> 28:25.138
Sloganize. Sloganize.

28:25.140 --> 28:28.198
Sloganize. Sloganize.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.098
Sloganize.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.198
Zolt. It's green...

28:32.200 --> 28:34.128
uh...

28:34.130 --> 28:36.148
and strong?

28:38.220 --> 28:39.200
Strong.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.050
Uh, now with taurine.

28:47.110 --> 28:50.048
That is kind of okay. It's a little okay.

28:50.050 --> 28:52.118
It's a little fucking stupid, but okay.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.128
That's good.

28:53.130 --> 28:54.200
Next!

29:00.040 --> 29:02.088
Oh, shit. Sam.

29:02.090 --> 29:04.028
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

29:04.030 --> 29:05.230
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.158
Thank God you're all right.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.040
Wow. What got into you last night?

29:22.070 --> 29:24.118
Come on. We have to leave.
This place is full of lunatics.

29:24.120 --> 29:26.080
- Are you high?
- No.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.228
- No.
- Okay.

29:28.230 --> 29:30.188
Whatever it is, clearly nothing I said

29:30.190 --> 29:32.078
got through to you yesterday.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.138
Okay. Listen. I get you
want to save this place,

29:34.140 --> 29:36.128
but this place is beyond fucking saving.

29:36.130 --> 29:38.058
Now come on. Let's go.

29:38.060 --> 29:39.100
- Let go!
- Whoa!

29:40.190 --> 29:42.220
Des, are you okay?

29:44.020 --> 29:45.178
How many of those have you had?

29:45.180 --> 29:46.160
This?

29:47.180 --> 29:50.048
Um... like half.

29:50.050 --> 29:51.090
Wait, wait. Wait.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.048
I just wanted to, uh, taste it.

29:54.050 --> 29:56.048
Okay. Well, get your own.
They're all over the building.

29:56.050 --> 29:59.040
Now, I have a lot of work to
do, and I'm really behind, so...

30:00.210 --> 30:03.130
You spilled my Zolt.

30:10.220 --> 30:14.180
Whoa. That was like falling
asleep behind the wheel.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.128
What are you doing on the floor?

30:17.130 --> 30:20.080
Uh, I'll explain once we
get the fuck out of here.

30:23.070 --> 30:24.120
You broke my picture!

30:25.120 --> 30:26.168
Shit!

30:37.170 --> 30:39.008
I'm gonna fuck you

30:39.010 --> 30:41.148
like the best man at my sister's wedding!

30:41.150 --> 30:42.210
Whose wedding? Jenny's?

30:44.090 --> 30:46.178
- Oh, my God!
- Dezzy Des.

30:46.180 --> 30:49.098
- I know you want this.
- Um, Sam...

30:49.100 --> 30:51.028
I've seen the way you look at me.

30:51.030 --> 30:52.218
You're not wrong. Busted.

30:52.220 --> 30:54.068
But maybe not right now.

30:54.070 --> 30:56.008
Shut up and take it, slut!

30:56.010 --> 30:57.008
Oh, God! No...

31:01.190 --> 31:03.128
You're psycho!

31:03.130 --> 31:05.168
You're crazy. Get off me.

31:05.170 --> 31:07.040
Oh, my God!

31:13.060 --> 31:14.120
Sam?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.148
Samantha?

31:17.150 --> 31:18.198
Okay, I'm really sorry

31:18.200 --> 31:20.018
about all this stuff that just went down,

31:20.020 --> 31:21.228
but I swear, I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.200
Des.

31:31.110 --> 31:32.100
Plan B.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.028
What the hell's going on?

31:41.030 --> 31:42.218
I'm getting us the hell out of here.

31:42.220 --> 31:45.088
- That's what's going on.
- On a furniture dolly?

31:45.090 --> 31:46.120
Here's a pink pillow.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.188
Desmond.

31:48.190 --> 31:51.188
Get me off of here right now.

31:51.190 --> 31:53.088
I can't. You'll attack me.

31:53.090 --> 31:55.028
Or sexually harass me, or both,

31:55.030 --> 31:56.168
which sends a really mixed message.

31:56.170 --> 31:59.098
Sexually har... I did
not sexually harass you.

31:59.100 --> 32:02.038
I'm not... I am completely
in control of myself.

32:02.040 --> 32:04.118
And this is a very impractical
solution, by the way.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.228
Desmond. Hey! Look at me.

32:06.230 --> 32:08.208
Look at me.

32:08.210 --> 32:09.210
Look at me.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.170
I'm fine.

32:16.020 --> 32:18.108
I'm gonna slice off your
nipples and put them on a pizza!

32:18.110 --> 32:20.118
Pepperoni!

32:20.120 --> 32:22.178
Listen to me. This is just wrong.

32:22.180 --> 32:25.010
- I don't even feel remotely safe like this.
- Oh, shit.

32:27.050 --> 32:28.060
Hello?

32:29.120 --> 32:30.138
Are you listening to me?

32:30.140 --> 32:32.038
Look what you made me do!

32:32.040 --> 32:33.158
Look what you made me do!

32:33.160 --> 32:35.038
Look what Zolt made me do!

32:35.040 --> 32:36.128
That's what we're gonna be singing.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.038
Sing to me now! Come on!

32:41.040 --> 32:42.178
And sloganize!

32:42.180 --> 32:46.008
Attention, Ammotech employees!

32:46.010 --> 32:47.198
As some of you may have noticed,

32:47.200 --> 32:50.058
our company is undergoing a regime change.

32:50.060 --> 32:52.008
Jesus, he's putting a
whole fucking mob together.

32:52.010 --> 32:53.050
My butt itches!

32:55.120 --> 32:57.080
Please, be quiet. Okay?

33:02.190 --> 33:04.008
What was that noise?

33:14.040 --> 33:15.158
Stop!

33:15.160 --> 33:16.160
Mo?

33:17.090 --> 33:18.218
Have you had any Zolt?

33:18.220 --> 33:19.230
It's Ramadan.

33:21.050 --> 33:22.028
Rama...

33:22.030 --> 33:23.198
It's Ramadan.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.158
I'm fasting, idiot.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.198
Oh. Right. Shiva and all that stuff.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.068
Shiva is the god of
death. That's Hinduism.

33:30.070 --> 33:32.000
- Where did you go to school?
- Shh!

33:33.090 --> 33:34.070
Come on.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.048
Now, there's only
room for one man to be in charge,

33:40.050 --> 33:41.218
so I'm going to need you and your people

33:41.220 --> 33:44.030
to get on board with me.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.220
You want us to get on board with you?

33:51.020 --> 33:54.108
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

33:55.220 --> 33:59.150
I'm detecting a little
hostility there, Bobby.

34:00.150 --> 34:02.078
And we both know that's not very conducive

34:02.080 --> 34:06.178
to a creative team atmosphere, now is it?

34:06.180 --> 34:08.148
- My lips are chapped!
- Shh!

34:10.120 --> 34:14.078
Shut her up.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.128
What the hell is wrong with her?

34:16.130 --> 34:18.068
She drank a half a can of Zolt...

34:18.070 --> 34:20.068
...and now whenever something
even mildly irritates her,

34:20.070 --> 34:21.168
she gets a little...

34:21.170 --> 34:23.118
...prickly.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.208
Prickly? You call that prickly?

34:25.210 --> 34:27.108
Look, if she's had any of that stuff,

34:27.110 --> 34:29.178
she's a zombie mutant
psycho like the rest of them.

34:29.179 --> 34:31.090
And we need to...

34:33.120 --> 34:35.018
You... You need to...

34:35.020 --> 34:36.197
What?

34:36.199 --> 34:38.108
...slice her throat open.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.158
Or, you know, stab her in
the stomach or something.

34:40.159 --> 34:42.178
Listen, anyone who lays a finger on her is... Oh!

34:42.179 --> 34:44.998
Shh!

34:45.000 --> 34:47.098
Stab her. Stab her.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.148
- Are you crazy?
- Shh!

34:48.150 --> 34:50.179
Let me ask you a question.

34:52.159 --> 34:57.118
What the fuck has
Accounting done lately, huh?

34:57.120 --> 34:59.048
Did you do the campaign that sold

34:59.050 --> 35:01.148
30,000 automatic shotguns to Blackwater?

35:01.150 --> 35:03.048
No! We did!

35:03.050 --> 35:06.228
How about the Nukey The
Talking Warhead campaign?

35:06.230 --> 35:09.138
Nope! We did that, too!

35:09.140 --> 35:12.208
How about Stack-the-Iraqi
board game? Now for children.

35:12.210 --> 35:15.028
Oh, nope, that was us, too!

35:15.030 --> 35:17.028
How about my personal favorite,

35:17.030 --> 35:20.138
the Agent Orange Soda campaign?

35:20.140 --> 35:23.188
Ding! Ding! Ding! That was us, too!

35:23.190 --> 35:28.210
Adver-fucking-tising!

35:31.120 --> 35:36.050
See, we make reality out of...

35:37.200 --> 35:40.210
...nothing.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.090
Mmm.

35:49.150 --> 35:51.050
Now...

35:52.140 --> 35:55.040
be a good girl and recycle this.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.130
Would you like to see me make a reality...

36:02.130 --> 36:04.118
out of nothing...

36:04.120 --> 36:06.018
Robert?

36:06.020 --> 36:08.150
Oh, please.

36:19.030 --> 36:21.178
Now, who amongst you is responsible

36:21.180 --> 36:24.140
for the Agent Orange Soda campaign?

36:28.210 --> 36:31.118
I hate you and your work.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.110
Everyone, kill those two and you may live.

36:35.170 --> 36:37.170
Welcome aboard!

36:47.140 --> 36:50.018
What the fuck just happened?

36:50.020 --> 36:52.158
Which part? The part where
Nusbaum took over Marketing

36:52.160 --> 36:54.008
by killing Bob with a soda can

36:54.010 --> 36:55.998
or the part where you
almost bit my finger off?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.190
What? Oh, my God!

37:00.040 --> 37:01.148
I'm so sorry.

37:01.150 --> 37:02.198
It's okay.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.158
No. It's not okay.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.228
You were in a weird place at the time.

37:05.230 --> 37:07.198
- I feel really terrible.
- I've been bitten by bigger...

37:07.200 --> 37:09.098
- I'm not gonna...
- Yeah, it was really fucked up

37:09.100 --> 37:11.050
and definitely not okay,
but we have to go right now.

37:13.070 --> 37:14.208
Is this your blood?

37:14.210 --> 37:16.178
Okay, okay, so this
is what we're gonna do.

37:16.180 --> 37:18.068
Okay, we're gonna take her
down the stairs, we're gonna...

37:18.070 --> 37:19.178
we're gonna steal a car,
we're gonna call the police

37:19.180 --> 37:21.048
and then have them call the National Guard.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.190
- Elevator?
- Elevator.

37:33.020 --> 37:34.030
Okay.

37:37.170 --> 37:38.230
Oh, my God!

37:41.050 --> 37:43.018
Does anyone else have
to use the bathroom?

37:43.020 --> 37:44.128
Yeah. I do.

37:44.130 --> 37:45.180
Okay. Good. Me too.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.170
Doors open.

38:00.150 --> 38:02.028
Going down.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.208
Seventh, sixth, fifth,
fourth... second, first.

38:06.150 --> 38:10.028
We are experiencing minor
technical difficulties.

38:10.030 --> 38:12.998
Uh, ventilation shaft?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.148
Uh, ventilation shaft.

38:14.150 --> 38:15.158
Yeah.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.178
Please... elevator.

38:17.180 --> 38:21.098
This isn't gonna work.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.000
Ow! So not gonna work!

38:24.100 --> 38:27.178
Motherfuckers, get me out of
here before I kill you both!

38:27.180 --> 38:30.000
- New plan?
- You think?

38:33.040 --> 38:34.118
Jesus.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.228
I don't even wanna think
about how that happened.

38:36.230 --> 38:38.998
- Should we help him?
- Okay. Un-tape me.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.078
Okay, that's never gonna happen.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.148
- I can be helpful.
- Oh, really?

38:42.150 --> 38:43.208
- How can you be helpful?
- I-I-I...

38:43.210 --> 38:45.148
- There's no way you can be helpful.
- I was cranky before

38:45.150 --> 38:47.078
because you bumped my head three times...

38:47.080 --> 38:49.028
I said shut up! Do you guys wanna end up

38:49.030 --> 38:51.048
with your gallbladder coming out your anus?

38:51.050 --> 38:53.108
No.

38:53.110 --> 38:54.998
I'm getting us out of here, okay.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.148
Oh, yeah, and what's your plan, huh?

38:56.150 --> 38:58.168
The staircase is blocked,
the phones are out,

38:58.170 --> 39:00.050
- there's no elev...
- Wait!

39:01.150 --> 39:04.020
You know what the shortest
distance between two points is?

39:05.100 --> 39:06.108
A line?

39:06.110 --> 39:07.170
It's a hole.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.038
No! No! No!

39:21.210 --> 39:24.228
Emergency
Safety Seal activated.

39:24.230 --> 39:28.078
This building is now
under Threat-Con Level 4.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.028
All employees, remain calm
and report to subsector B

39:31.030 --> 39:33.088
for further instruction.

39:33.090 --> 39:35.008
What the fuck is this?

39:35.010 --> 39:37.228
Next-gen
anti-terror system.

39:37.230 --> 39:39.208
Armored shutters and bulletproof glass

39:39.210 --> 39:42.048
to safeguard against rocket attacks.

39:42.050 --> 39:44.058
- We're locked in.
- It was spelled out clearly

39:44.060 --> 39:46.118
in the Employee Training
Booklet. Didn't you read it?

39:46.120 --> 39:48.060
Of course I read it.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.138
I skimmed it.

39:53.020 --> 39:55.078
Now I see why you didn't want me
to throw the thing at the window.

39:55.080 --> 39:57.048
No! I didn't want you to
throw the thing at the window,

39:57.050 --> 39:58.228
and I didn't want you
to almost get us killed,

39:58.230 --> 40:00.148
and I definitely didn't
want you to do anything

40:00.150 --> 40:03.128
that the pot-sponge-you-call
a-brain processes as helping us.

40:03.130 --> 40:05.078
Mo! Shush!

40:05.080 --> 40:08.018
Desmond could have left,
but he didn't. Okay.

40:08.020 --> 40:09.230
So stop being an asshole.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.070
Now...

40:13.140 --> 40:15.188
how do we get the security seal open?

40:17.170 --> 40:22.128
Only top management has the
codes to reopen the seal.

40:22.130 --> 40:25.208
Great! So we just go
find those guys up in...

40:25.210 --> 40:27.018
The executive level.

40:27.020 --> 40:28.190
That means we gotta go through...

40:34.200 --> 40:35.210
Okay. We're fucked.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.070
- You think?
- Mm-hmm.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.188
How do we do this?

40:51.190 --> 40:53.178
The second they see us, we're history.

40:53.180 --> 40:56.048
Uh, we could pretend to
be crazy mutant psychos

40:56.050 --> 40:57.158
like the rest of them.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.008
I like your idea. How?

41:00.010 --> 41:02.058
Just say stuff
that makes you really mad.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.200
Oh, I was born to do this.

41:05.170 --> 41:06.228
Hairy asses!

41:06.230 --> 41:08.188
Jennifer Lawrence at an awards show.

41:08.190 --> 41:10.098
I can't eat cheese!

41:10.100 --> 41:11.198
Men with Botox!

41:11.200 --> 41:13.188
Dig deeper. Dig deeper.

41:13.190 --> 41:15.228
My father touched me!

41:15.230 --> 41:18.060
- Too deep!
- Homework!

41:19.110 --> 41:20.198
Justin Bieber on a Segway!

41:29.000 --> 41:30.100
- It's clear. Let's go.
- Okay.

41:34.170 --> 41:35.180
What?

41:37.180 --> 41:39.128
Oh, my God.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.038
Is that Helen?

41:41.040 --> 41:44.168
Oh, this actually makes me kind of sad.

41:44.170 --> 41:46.128
Why hasn't she retired yet?

41:46.130 --> 41:48.008
- In this economy? Mm
- mm.

41:48.010 --> 41:50.028
Looks like she's got
arthritis in her hips.

41:50.030 --> 41:51.198
Oh, my Uncle Usef had that.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.068
You should try getting him baked.

41:53.070 --> 41:55.098
I am not gonna get my uncle baked.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.090
Okay.

41:57.090 --> 41:58.180
Shit.

42:01.050 --> 42:02.088
Okay, look, what do we do?

42:02.090 --> 42:03.138
I guess we could, uh...

42:03.140 --> 42:05.068
We could wheel around
her. Wheel around her.

42:05.070 --> 42:07.068
I can't. She's got too much of a reach.

42:07.070 --> 42:08.218
Oh, God, fuck.
We gotta do something.

42:08.220 --> 42:10.030
Hold on!

42:15.150 --> 42:18.028
Uh... You just hit
an 80-year-old lady

42:18.030 --> 42:20.048
over the head with a potted plant?

42:20.050 --> 42:22.078
- Yes, but in, like, self
- defense.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.118
- Oh, yeah? Self
- defense? What was she gonna do?

42:24.120 --> 42:26.048
- Gum us to death?
- She has teeth!

42:26.050 --> 42:27.218
- Yeah, that she can't use.
- She can!

42:27.220 --> 42:28.190
Guys!

42:30.100 --> 42:32.108
Where the hell did she go?

42:42.060 --> 42:44.078
I can't believe I just did that.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.038
It was an accident.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.188
You just wall-butted
an 80-year-old lady

42:47.190 --> 42:49.040
in the face on accident.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.200
Yes. No. I-I-I
don't know.

42:53.210 --> 42:57.018
No! Oh, my God!

42:57.020 --> 42:59.198
It's kind of heroic, as far
as beating up the elderly goes.

42:59.200 --> 43:01.028
- Is she okay?
- No, she's not.

43:01.030 --> 43:02.108
You're both terrible people.

43:02.110 --> 43:04.008
But...

43:04.010 --> 43:05.108
...we have to get through HR.

43:05.110 --> 43:07.210
- I can't do this. I can't...
- Yes, you can.

43:09.050 --> 43:11.100
- They are nice ladies.
- Great.

43:24.220 --> 43:26.038
Okay!

43:26.040 --> 43:29.098
That is why we do not send
work e-mails with emoticons!

43:29.100 --> 43:33.048
Oh, God. Human Resources is
a pack of rabid koala bears.

43:33.050 --> 43:36.168
Oh, yeah. Sexy, slutty koala bears,

43:36.170 --> 43:38.198
in their natural habitat.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.200
Back to work.

43:41.210 --> 43:44.098
Hey. Notice how they've all
been stabbed in the back?

43:44.100 --> 43:47.008
- What are you saying?
- Nothing. Just, you know...

43:47.010 --> 43:48.208
Nothing? Just, you know,
because HR is basically all women,

43:48.210 --> 43:51.058
it automatically makes us
a bunch of backstabbers?

43:51.060 --> 43:53.168
Okay, first off, HR is not all women.

43:53.170 --> 43:56.038
Look, there's a guy right
there. Oh, shit! It's Lentworth!

43:56.040 --> 43:57.098
- E
- Excuse me.

43:57.100 --> 43:59.148
Uh, I gotta pick up my check.

43:59.150 --> 44:00.168
- Lentworth!
- Lentworth!

44:00.170 --> 44:01.200
- Hello?
- Lentworth!

44:04.060 --> 44:05.080
Oh, hi...

44:08.030 --> 44:10.060
Oh, God.

44:21.170 --> 44:22.140
I...

44:23.120 --> 44:25.110
see a lot of familiar faces.

44:27.050 --> 44:30.198
I know you. Remember
I asked you out when...

44:30.200 --> 44:31.220
I got divorced and...

44:33.150 --> 44:34.120
Oh.

44:37.070 --> 44:38.060
Get back!

44:39.070 --> 44:41.168
I mean it, get back! I'll use it!

44:50.010 --> 44:51.178
Attention, Human Resources.

44:51.180 --> 44:53.190
This is Adam Nusbaum from Accounting.

44:56.010 --> 44:58.188
Just a reminder about
the Accounting-HR meeting

44:58.190 --> 45:01.020
starting momentarily
in the conference room.

45:06.150 --> 45:08.088
We'll be covering such issues as

45:08.090 --> 45:09.228
installing the ATS

45:09.230 --> 45:12.198
to handle all OSHA documents and NDIs

45:12.200 --> 45:15.038
in order to better guarantee QC.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.098
Don't lay it on too thick.

45:16.100 --> 45:17.100
I got this.

45:18.130 --> 45:21.068
Quick, informal T&amp;D sessions

45:21.070 --> 45:22.120
to go over our BPOs.

45:23.130 --> 45:25.228
BPO stands for Business
Processing Outsourcing.

45:25.230 --> 45:27.998
That's got nothing to
do with our department.

45:31.150 --> 45:34.030
Uh, I mean, uh, BPDs.

45:35.020 --> 45:36.220
- Oh, BPDs.
- Fine.

45:39.180 --> 45:40.180
They're buying it.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.998
Shit. Do you think they heard that?

45:43.000 --> 45:44.048
- Yes.
- Shut up.

45:46.230 --> 45:48.148
Pull me out. Pull me out.

45:48.150 --> 45:49.180
Pull me out. Pull me out.

45:50.140 --> 45:52.170
That way. Face me that
way. Face me that... Wait!

45:55.200 --> 45:57.160
We are not the ones you wanna kill.

45:58.220 --> 45:59.220
She is.

46:02.220 --> 46:04.088
What the hell are you talking about?

46:04.090 --> 46:06.148
Oh... honey.

46:06.150 --> 46:09.000
I-I've been in HR long
enough to know things.

46:09.210 --> 46:12.008
Jill! Jill!

46:12.010 --> 46:14.118
Remember when you were
gonna be made supervisor

46:14.120 --> 46:15.998
and then you didn't get the job?

46:16.000 --> 46:17.128
Well, that's because Lisa spread a rumor

46:17.130 --> 46:19.118
that you and your husband
have cocaine orgies.

46:21.070 --> 46:22.198
That was one time,

46:22.200 --> 46:24.118
and you were there.

46:24.120 --> 46:27.188
She's lying. She's totally lying.

46:27.190 --> 46:29.008
Katie! Katie!

46:29.010 --> 46:31.038
Remember those baby
pictures you brought in?

46:31.040 --> 46:34.018
Well, Lisa says that it looks like you...

46:34.020 --> 46:35.138
fucked a bag of potatoes.

46:37.210 --> 46:40.048
You're talking about my child?

46:40.050 --> 46:41.150
Hold my wig.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.108
I'm gonna kill you.

46:44.110 --> 46:46.048
Oh! One more thing!

46:46.050 --> 46:48.038
She keeps this department under budget

46:48.040 --> 46:50.118
by setting the thermostat to cold!

46:50.120 --> 46:52.128
In the wintertime!

46:53.180 --> 46:55.028
This is bullshit!

46:55.030 --> 46:56.188
- Yeah!
- Don't listen to her.

46:56.190 --> 46:58.178
- Get her!
- She's trying to turn us...

46:58.180 --> 47:00.048
all against me.

47:00.050 --> 47:02.028
- Guys, I like sweaters.
- Sic her!

47:02.030 --> 47:03.158
Punish her!

47:03.160 --> 47:04.178
You guys know me. We're friends.

47:04.180 --> 47:05.998
We have Wine Wednesdays.

47:07.060 --> 47:08.158
You're a genius!

47:08.160 --> 47:10.078
Let's go. Let's go. Let's
go. Let's go. Let's go.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.200
That was great. Sad for Lisa, but great.

47:13.220 --> 47:15.040
Lentworth, come on.

47:24.190 --> 47:26.208
No, no, no, no.
Don't try to play me, son.

47:26.210 --> 47:29.018
Who you think you're talking
to? I ain't no punk bitch.

47:29.020 --> 47:32.138
If I say you need 55
cases of tear-gas rockets,

47:32.140 --> 47:33.188
that's what you're gonna get,

47:33.190 --> 47:36.020
or we're gonna have a fucking problem!

47:37.090 --> 47:40.158
Please, please, tell me
there's another way around this.

47:40.160 --> 47:43.018
Wish I could. Only
way up to the exec level

47:43.020 --> 47:44.168
is right through there.

47:44.170 --> 47:47.098
I will send a fucking
rocket to your house!

47:47.100 --> 47:49.208
I will fucking bury you, motherfucker!

47:53.100 --> 47:55.150
- We should get weapons.
- Yeah.

48:05.220 --> 48:08.158
Hey, Des, this is
just like your video game.

48:08.160 --> 48:10.018
Grabbing stuff from the aisles.

48:10.020 --> 48:12.200
Except this is duct tape,
not cookies, obviously.

48:14.020 --> 48:15.180
Des, are you making a video game?

48:17.000 --> 48:18.148
Yeah, but it's no big deal.

48:18.150 --> 48:20.140
Just a side thing, a hobby.

48:21.160 --> 48:23.008
Why didn't you tell me?

48:23.010 --> 48:24.190
'Cause it's silly.

48:26.090 --> 48:27.218
I think it sounds cool.

48:27.220 --> 48:29.060
It's super cool.

48:31.200 --> 48:33.030
I got a plan.

48:34.030 --> 48:35.070
Cool.

48:50.060 --> 48:52.138
Just so we're clear, my
principles still hold.

48:52.140 --> 48:54.198
I'm not committing any acts of violence.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.038
Dude, we're about to go into battle.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.148
Why'd you even put that on?

48:57.150 --> 48:59.188
- Everybody else was doing it.
- Okay,

48:59.190 --> 49:01.138
you can push Samatha, so Lentworth and I

49:01.140 --> 49:03.018
can commit some acts of violence.

49:03.020 --> 49:04.088
That sounds good. Here, take these.

49:04.090 --> 49:06.068
You know, I'm not really that comfy

49:06.070 --> 49:07.158
with the whole spearing part.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.048
And now I'm holding spears.

49:10.050 --> 49:11.108
You have to cut me loose, Des.

49:11.110 --> 49:13.098
And if I go full Zolt

49:13.100 --> 49:15.078
and I don't come back,

49:15.080 --> 49:16.168
kill me.

49:16.170 --> 49:18.048
I'm serious.

49:18.050 --> 49:19.108
But you have to cut me loose.

49:19.110 --> 49:20.998
We need all the help that we can get.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.088
Don't listen to her. She's a crazy witch.

49:22.090 --> 49:23.098
She can't be trusted.

49:23.100 --> 49:26.018
I'm serious about the
"kill me" part, okay.

49:26.020 --> 49:27.140
Serious.

49:29.070 --> 49:30.100
Deal?

49:31.230 --> 49:32.220
Deal.

49:40.050 --> 49:43.018
You think you're a tough guy?
I'm Ammotech, you tool bag!

49:43.020 --> 49:45.078
Just try me, you tough guy.
I'll show you how tough.

49:45.080 --> 49:47.998
You ain't even fighting
in the same weight class.

49:49.060 --> 49:51.020
Uh, I'm gonna turn
around. Anyone else?

50:00.040 --> 50:01.020
Hey!

50:06.080 --> 50:07.208
Hi, fellas.

50:07.210 --> 50:10.218
I know it looks like we're
rolling up on you for a fight,

50:10.220 --> 50:12.048
but it's really not the case.

50:12.050 --> 50:13.088
The opposite, in fact.

50:13.090 --> 50:15.998
All we want to do is just go through you

50:16.000 --> 50:17.040
to that door over there.

50:22.230 --> 50:23.218
- Right, guys?
- Yeah.

50:23.220 --> 50:25.000
Yeah.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.080
So, everyone's cool?

50:28.130 --> 50:29.160
Yeah?

50:31.110 --> 50:33.030
Kill them all!

50:45.230 --> 50:47.080
Help me!

50:56.150 --> 50:58.088
Any violence is purely coincidental

50:58.090 --> 50:59.148
and has nothing to do with me!

51:23.060 --> 51:25.138
Try again, Baldy! USA!

51:25.140 --> 51:27.170
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

51:32.070 --> 51:34.198
Please stop chasing me!

51:35.200 --> 51:38.028
I did not do that. That was not my fault!

51:38.030 --> 51:42.028
Please stop impaling yourselves!

51:47.230 --> 51:49.190
I hope you're not allergic!

52:02.220 --> 52:05.018
- Did you drink any Zolt?
- What? No!

52:05.020 --> 52:06.098
We gotta get out of here.

52:06.100 --> 52:08.138
Whatever you do, don't drink...

52:11.100 --> 52:12.168
Okay. That was me.

52:12.170 --> 52:15.018
I'm 100 percent sure I just did that.

52:15.020 --> 52:16.228
- He, uh...
- I just killed someone.

52:16.230 --> 52:18.178
But I saved you. I saved you, right?

52:18.180 --> 52:20.230
Let's never talk about this to anyone.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.008
Okay. F...

52:25.010 --> 52:26.128
I don't feel good.

52:26.130 --> 52:27.110
Sam.

52:28.170 --> 52:29.170
Sam.

52:31.140 --> 52:32.218
We're gonna get you help, okay.

52:32.220 --> 52:33.998
Okay, almost there. Come on.

52:46.230 --> 52:48.000
We good?

52:49.050 --> 52:50.100
Okay. Come on, let's go.

52:52.140 --> 52:53.160
My back hurts.

53:12.060 --> 53:13.190
Um... sir?

53:14.190 --> 53:16.040
You might want to come take a look at this.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.040
What you got?

53:21.050 --> 53:22.200
Fuck me.

53:27.110 --> 53:30.078
Sorry, folks! No room at the inn.

53:30.080 --> 53:32.008
You got three seconds

53:32.010 --> 53:33.058
to step away from that door.

53:33.060 --> 53:35.118
Wait, wait, wait. Wait,
wait, wait. We're not like

53:35.120 --> 53:37.028
those other crazy people. We're normal.

53:38.110 --> 53:39.188
Oh!

53:41.220 --> 53:44.058
Uh, she does that sometimes.

53:44.060 --> 53:46.138
It's totally not a big deal.

53:46.140 --> 53:48.218
I have this rule about
not opening the door

53:48.220 --> 53:50.178
for people who are armed
and covered in blood.

53:50.180 --> 53:52.058
And right now, y'all look like

53:52.060 --> 53:55.128
the Four Used Tampons of the Apocalypse!

54:00.060 --> 54:01.118
My building!

54:01.120 --> 54:03.028
My rules!

54:03.030 --> 54:04.090
He's not gonna let us in.

54:12.130 --> 54:14.030
Uh... hi.

54:20.140 --> 54:22.050
Shit.

54:26.050 --> 54:27.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:29.060 --> 54:31.118
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:31.120 --> 54:32.998
Everybody calm down! Goddammit!

54:33.000 --> 54:35.018
This is a weapons manufacturing firm!

54:35.020 --> 54:37.000
Violence has no place in here!

54:39.220 --> 54:42.020
You. The hell do you want?

54:42.230 --> 54:44.168
We want to know what's in this Zolt shit!

54:44.170 --> 54:45.150
We want to know now!

54:46.200 --> 54:48.100
Oh. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

54:50.170 --> 54:52.020
Looks like you could use a drink.

54:55.210 --> 54:57.118
I mean scotch!

54:57.120 --> 55:00.140
For chrissake, stop looking
at me like I'm a monster!

55:06.070 --> 55:07.208
I'll take a water, no ice.

55:07.210 --> 55:10.080
Water, no ice. Okay. Who's next?

55:19.040 --> 55:21.098
Zolt was designed for soldiers.

55:21.100 --> 55:23.178
Makes them alert, focused,

55:23.180 --> 55:24.200
productive.

55:26.140 --> 55:27.228
But this first batch...

55:28.210 --> 55:31.128
...well, shit went sideways.

55:31.130 --> 55:33.118
So what's it doing in our company?

55:33.120 --> 55:36.088
Well, the best I can gather is

55:36.090 --> 55:38.098
the scientist under Dr. Frohm

55:38.100 --> 55:41.148
became disgruntled, for
reasons unknown to me.

55:41.150 --> 55:44.108
And as a parting "fuck you" to the company

55:44.110 --> 55:46.208
distributed the bad Zolt to the employees

55:46.210 --> 55:49.170
and, uh, shit, here we are.

55:51.010 --> 55:53.070
I'll deny all this, by the way, if deposed.

55:54.080 --> 55:55.120
So what's the plan?

55:56.080 --> 55:57.998
We're safe in here.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.068
Grab a drink. Settle in.

56:00.070 --> 56:03.178
Let the, uh, infected
employees punch themselves out,

56:03.180 --> 56:05.168
and then...

56:05.170 --> 56:06.218
...bring in the hazmat!

56:06.220 --> 56:09.168
Punch themselves out? They're
ripping each other's faces off!

56:09.170 --> 56:11.140
I don't like it any
more than you do, son.

56:13.070 --> 56:16.108
See, this woman here, she's really,
really, really important to me.

56:16.110 --> 56:18.228
And whatever's in the stuff is
destroying her piece by piece,

56:18.230 --> 56:20.140
and I've got to find a way to stop it!

56:21.150 --> 56:23.178
- Such as?
- Such as,

56:23.180 --> 56:24.210
I don't know, an antidote?

56:30.080 --> 56:32.060
Why would we make an antidote?

56:34.070 --> 56:37.158
You don't make a product and
then plan on it being recalled.

56:37.160 --> 56:42.058
Did we do that with land mines?
Cluster bombs? Irradiated ammo?

56:42.060 --> 56:45.138
Hell, no. We just make the stuff.

56:45.140 --> 56:48.008
You start thinking about
what happens afterwards,

56:48.010 --> 56:50.198
next thing you know, you're
living in San Francisco,

56:50.200 --> 56:52.108
singing "If I Had a Hammer,"

56:52.110 --> 56:54.068
running a goddamn daisy farm!

56:54.070 --> 56:56.058
- I'm not fucking around, old man.
- Whoa!

56:56.060 --> 56:57.120
Whoa, whoa.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.208
Well, that's very touching son,

57:00.210 --> 57:03.068
but you may want to drop your hands.

57:03.070 --> 57:05.148
This thumbprint is the only way

57:05.150 --> 57:07.228
that safety seal gets lifted.

57:07.230 --> 57:11.068
And since y'all are relying on me

57:11.070 --> 57:13.068
to get you out of this mess,

57:13.070 --> 57:16.010
I suggest you start
acting like a team player.

57:20.160 --> 57:21.220
There we go.

57:22.230 --> 57:24.208
You want to talk to the
man that made the stuff?

57:24.210 --> 57:26.158
That's Dr. Frohm.

57:26.160 --> 57:29.028
But good luck getting down
to his office right now.

57:30.100 --> 57:32.198
Oh, Christ!

57:32.200 --> 57:35.170
Why is the fucking regional manager here?

57:36.100 --> 57:37.118
Mother...

57:37.120 --> 57:38.210
Shit.

57:41.230 --> 57:44.220
What the hell do you want, buddy boy?

57:46.080 --> 57:48.088
Hello, Franklin.

57:48.090 --> 57:51.128
My team and I are looking to
do some aggressive expansion,

57:51.130 --> 57:54.008
so I'm going to need you
to rescind the safety seal

57:54.010 --> 57:56.140
around the building.

57:58.060 --> 58:00.120
Rescind the seal.

58:01.230 --> 58:04.098
Only thing I'm rescinding
is the part of your contract

58:04.100 --> 58:06.118
where it says I can't take out my dick

58:06.120 --> 58:09.000
and whip you with it
like a stagecoach driver.

58:10.100 --> 58:12.078
Yes, I thought you might say that.

58:12.080 --> 58:15.058
I also thought you might like to
keep the thumb on your left hand

58:15.060 --> 58:17.188
as well as your worthless fucking life,

58:17.190 --> 58:19.180
so I'm giving you ten seconds to comply.

58:20.230 --> 58:23.088
Well, good luck getting in here, pal.

58:25.010 --> 58:28.028
My doors are
two-inch thick titanium

58:28.030 --> 58:29.218
steel-tempered alloy

58:29.220 --> 58:31.168
with retinal scanners

58:31.170 --> 58:34.188
and a voice-print security ID system

58:34.190 --> 58:37.160
designed by the top engineers in Sweden!

58:38.090 --> 58:39.098
Motherfucker.

58:39.100 --> 58:41.010
And what about the walls?

58:45.120 --> 58:47.048
Say again?

58:47.050 --> 58:50.018
You know... the walls?

58:50.020 --> 58:52.188
Are they two-inch thick
titanium made in Sweden?

58:52.190 --> 58:54.218
Or, as I recall from the purchase orders,

58:54.220 --> 58:57.028
made by an underpaid subcontractor

58:57.030 --> 58:58.138
who skimped on building materials

58:58.140 --> 58:59.210
so he could make a few bucks.

59:04.090 --> 59:07.100
See you in a few minutes... buddy boy.

59:11.120 --> 59:12.120
What the fuck was that?

59:13.150 --> 59:14.190
Get your ass out there.

59:20.080 --> 59:22.158
Shit, y'all look in here.
I got shells everywhere.

59:22.160 --> 59:24.040
Just... gotta get the goddamn keys.

59:26.140 --> 59:27.190
Come on, Sam.

59:28.110 --> 59:29.128
Fuck! Just fuck!

59:29.130 --> 59:31.088
Stay put, okay.

59:31.090 --> 59:33.070
All right, here we go. Here we go.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.158
Shit.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.160
Come on, come on.

59:44.150 --> 59:46.050
Come on.

59:54.170 --> 59:56.198
Hey, Mo, can you give me a hand?

59:56.200 --> 59:58.180
I don't know who I am anymore.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.028
Hey, Mo, don't do this. We need you.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.198
- I wall
- butted an old lady.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.998
Who was biting you.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.228
I sprayed cleaning
liquid into a man's eyes.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:12.028
Who was attacking us.

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:15.060
I split a guy's neck
open with an axe. Oh, shit.

01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:18.018
I thought we agreed we
weren't gonna talk about that.

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.200
- I'm a monster.
- No.

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:22.018
They are monsters.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.220
You are my best friend here.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.080
Behind Samantha and this dude
I used to smoke weed with.

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:31.128
- Who?
- Okay,

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:33.068
you're my third best friend.

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:35.038
I'm your third best friend?

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.108
That's awesome.

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:38.118
Well, if you want our third
best friendship to survive,

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.998
I need you in the game.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.088
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.118
Yeah. -So come on, let me
see your war-face, right now.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.130
Let me see it. Like this. Ready?

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:49.108
Okay.

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.088
- Okay. A bit more war
- like.

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:57.130
Okay.

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.198
Great!

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.140
A for effort. Let's do this! Lentworth!

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:10.150
Lentworth, get your ass
over here and give me a hand!

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.020
- What was that?
- Nothing.

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.038
Are you drinking the...

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.138
- Give me the can, Lentworth.
- No, look.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.008
I just gotta get my job back!

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.038
Are you fucking out of your mind?

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.158
Maybe if I'll like them, I'll fit in!

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.190
Help me! Lentworth's going rogue!

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.010
Get your ass out there!
Keep 'em outta this office!

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.108
Do you know how much it costs

01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:36.028
to go to Nevada and get a hooker?

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:38.008
And I got a mortgage and car payments

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.160
- and insurance!
- Plug the wall!

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:43.018
And I'm paying 60,000 bucks a year

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.228
for my daughter to study pottery
at Sarah fucking Lawrence!

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:47.118
Don't do this! Don't!

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.188
This is not the time for
me to be looking for work!

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.058
I'm one of you! I'm one of you!

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.058
Whoa!

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.110
All right, you motherfuckers.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:09.078
- Come on, Mo.
- You can run, but you can't hide.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.088
Welcome to the penthouse, motherfuckers!

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:15.230
Oh, shit.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.080
- Oh.
- Goddammit

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:32.180
Last opportunity to show
some collaboration, Mr. Gantt!

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.080
Hide behind the bush.

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.168
Bring me his thumb.

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:53.140
Which one of you fucks wants a taste?

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:07.170
Piss off!

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:13.068
Yeah, run, you
sissy little fuckers.

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:14.110
A little help here?

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:22.098
All y'all are fucking fired!

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:27.110
Goddammit! You cut off my goddamn hand.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.230
Goddamn.

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:35.130
This is a real nice office, Mr. Gantt.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.040
Ah. I gotta get me one of these.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.058
I can't die like this.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.218
I'm a goddamn war hero!

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.208
You never set foot in Iraq!

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:48.998
- I served!
- In Thailand!

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.078
Irrelevant!

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.078
Hope you enjoyed the ladyboys.

01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:56.148
Kill them.

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:57.170
Whoa! Whoa!

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.048
You got what you wanted.
The company's yours.

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:03.078
Now, let us walk, okay.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.098
We hereby tender our resignations.

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.058
I think I speak for all of us when I say

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.210
we really don't want
to work for you anymore.

01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:12.188
Oh, everyone's going to
be working for me, Desmond.

01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:14.208
- What?
- Do you think

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:18.018
this pissant little bullet
factory is my endgame?

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.208
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:24.108
I've got my sights set on
much, much bigger things.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.198
So what, you're going to become

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.170
regional manager of the world?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.160
You know, I do like the sound of that.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.070
Excellent.

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:41.080
Deliver their heads to me!

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.068
Back the fuck up!

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:54.168
First one to come cops
a bullet to the face.

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:56.038
There's 20 of them.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.168
There's only one shell left in that gun,

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.070
and there's six of us!

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:02.220
Then I guess I'm gonna need more ammo.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.190
Holy shit, that's the
coolest thing I've ever seen.

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:21.158
Oh, God.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.228
Sam.

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:24.138
Just hang in there.

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:27.158
I don't feel well.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.078
Sam? Hey.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.160
Come on, guys.

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.078
You have to kill me.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.130
You're gonna make it,
okay. Just hang in there.

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:40.060
I'm gonna to get you help, okay. Trust me.

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:42.160
Sam?

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.120
Samantha?

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:49.100
Samantha.

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:16.208
Well.

01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:18.128
Thank you, Mr. Gantt.

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:28.028
Attention, all remaining
Ammotech employees.

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:31.230
We are now going into Stage Three:

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:36.108
Distribution! Total
saturation of all markets!

01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:39.108
Local, regional,

01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:42.030
national, and global!

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.010
Hey. Hey!

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:58.190
Oh, Jesus Christ, Samantha. Here.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.048
What the fuck did you do?

01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:06.178
Damn it!

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.178
No! I didn't do anything.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.008
I did not do anything.

01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:13.118
It was not supposed to be
administered to employees, okay.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.028
But that little shit of a doctor,

01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:20.088
he thinks that I screwed him
out of credit on the experiment.

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:23.048
- Did you?
- Well, yes, of course I did!

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:25.228
But, like, take me to
court, file a grievance,

01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:28.198
like, go through the normal
channels on that shit.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.008
Don't hand out weaponized soft drinks

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.108
to your colleagues!

01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:34.198
Christ, I mean, that's out of line.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.208
Don't even try to lay
it off on that nerd.

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:38.010
This is your fault!

01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:41.148
My fault? Really?

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:43.010
Are you sure about that, Desmond?

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:50.998
This is the purchase order for
my boron silicate hydroxide,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.158
which I have been trying to
put through your department

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.158
for the better part of a month.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.068
Which, coincidentally,
I found in the trash can

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:58.148
outside my office this morning.

01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:59.198
So what are you saying?

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.008
I'm saying...

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.018
we tested the formula, it worked fine,

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.168
but because we were on a deadline,

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.998
but we didn't have the right compounds now,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.998
and we had to make...

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.128
we had to make do.

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:12.118
Make do?

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.148
With replacement chemicals.

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:16.178
That have a bit of a nasty side effect.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.210
How do we undo it? That's
all I want to hear out of you.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:27.048
So, good news is,
she didn't ingest enough of it

01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:28.167
to have it take full effect.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.018
If she he still has enough unaffected,

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.188
then I might be able to bring her back.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.138
What about everyone else?

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:36.078
Oh, the people who
consumed the full dosage?

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.098
- Yeah.
- You should forget about them.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.178
They're dead. Their frontal lobe

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.997
looks like Octomom's vagina at this point.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.188
Bad news is, her higher
motor functions are going

01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:46.148
to continue to shut down,

01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:50.048
and in about 30 minutes,
without the right antidote,

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:53.020
um... we might not be
able to bring her back.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.029
What do you need to make a cure?

01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:00.218
Okay. There it is.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:03.008
One vial will do it,
but the more the better.

01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:05.138
With that, I might be able

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.068
to rig a formula to reverse the effects.

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:10.068
But I don't know. The clock's ticking.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.170
So all we have to do is
go in there and get it.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.087
In there, yeah. Basically.

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:22.050
My God, he's got the whole
place running like clockwork.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.229
Back in 30 minutes. Fucknuts. Come on.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.080
Wait, you two are gonna take them all on?

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:33.028
That's great. We're all gonna die.

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:34.100
I can hear you.

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:38.118
It is true that there is no "I" in team.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.038
However, there is an "I" in win.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.148
We are only as strong

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:45.028
as the weakest link in our chain.

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:46.088
Oh, shit.

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:48.020
Oh, Ralph.

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:52.078
So destroy the weakest link.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.180
No, wait. No, no.

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:03.008
If I ever get out of here, I'm
definitely gonna go see a therapist.

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.050
There it is.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.080
This might be slightly more
difficult than I imagined.

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:17.118
Mr. Brimble and Mr. Haryana,

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.218
hello.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:22.008
Might I suggest the next time
you try to sneak up on someone,

01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:26.020
you do it in a place
without security cameras.

01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:30.088
All personnel, please report
to Section A-2. Thank you.

01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:31.128
- Shit.
- Shit!

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:35.110
Shit, shit, shit.

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:41.070
Come on. Fuck!

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:47.208
Step on it. Step on it.

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:50.058
You're obsessed with
this landmine bullshit.

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.088
And it's not gonna work!

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.048
Oh, I like my steak well-done!

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:01.088
And that's how I like my co-workers!

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:05.120
I hate you all!

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.188
This was poorly planned.

01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.138
I'm just kidding! You guys are like family.

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.128
Let's go. Quick.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.120
Have a blessed day!

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.038
Battle mode!

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:24.010
Duck!

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.160
Hang on!

01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:48.200
Let's go. Let's go!

01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:00.040
Okay. Hold these.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.210
Yes. Hey, Mo! I got it.

01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:15.150
Desmond!

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.170
Shit.

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:31.058
Mr. Brimble! Since you continue
to prove yourself incapable

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.060
of fitting in with Ammotech culture...

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:36.160
now you die.

01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:40.120
Are you kidding me?

01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:44.090
Run!

01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:49.168
Oh. Oh. Oh.

01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:51.080
What the hell is he wearing?

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:00.998
Hey, Mo!

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.000
Catch!

01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:06.118
Get it to Sam.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.188
No, you can't stay here!

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:09.058
If we both run, he'll catch us,

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:10.198
but not if I keep his ass busy.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.208
And besides, it's my fault.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:14.228
- Someone's got to take responsibility...
- No, no, no, you convinced me.

01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:16.148
I'm going.

01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:18.108
It's been an honor
sharing a cubicle with you.

01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:19.218
You too, buddy.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.060
Hey, boss!

01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:29.200
Mr. Brimble!

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.208
So glad to see you finally taking

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:35.220
some initiative today, Desmond.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.150
It's almost a shame
that I have to kill you.

01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:54.090
What's up, playa!

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.028
Look at this shit. You're just gonna

01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:04.160
let me beat your ass to
death right now, aren't you?

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:09.070
Guess what? I can roll with that, bro.

01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:12.098
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.158
You want some more?

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.078
Oh, come here, I got something for you.

01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:19.048
This is exhausting.

01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:20.158
You want more? Okay, I got more.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.068
I got more. More for you, right here.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.058
Welcome to America!

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.008
Land of the free, bitch!

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:30.020
Come here!

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.098
Marcus, because of your racism,

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.168
your thuggishness, and
your complete inability

01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:42.218
to call me by the right fucking name,

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.098
I hereby sentence you

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.228
to a lot of fucking pain.

01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:54.090
Is that all you got?

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.188
That was my war-face, motherfucker!

01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:22.048
Oh, looks like someone wants overtime.

01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:25.148
I'll give you fucking
overtime! Come on! Come on!

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:26.150
Huh?!

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:35.180
Over here, minions!

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.218
Hey, Nusbaum!

01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:59.128
Guess who's been stealing
hundreds of dollars' worth

01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:02.088
of company office supplies
since the day he started?

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:31.098
And in the past 16 months, I've done...

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:34.178
maybe six weeks' worth
of actual work. Tops.

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:37.138
You've been paying me mostly to
get high and work on my video game.

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.198
So, thank you.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.150
I guess it's time for my exit interview.

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:51.218
You've always been impeccably bad

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:55.110
at reading the instructions,
haven't you, Desmond?

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.058
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.230
Fuck instructions.

01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:16.030
Bring it, Anusbaum!

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.168
Brimble, help me.

01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:41.130
No! No!

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.140
Not now!

01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:49.228
Hello, Marcus. So good to see you.

01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:51.038
Oh! Wait, wait.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.118
Oh! I'm gonna tell my uncle!

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.078
Teamwork makes the dream work!

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.120
Shit!

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.190
Samantha! Sam!

01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:15.158
- Are you okay now, or...
- No!

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.128
- Oh, shit!
- I'm just kidding, I'm fine.

01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:18.228
Really. Mo gave me the antidote.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.048
Should we get the fuck outta here?

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:21.128
That's funny, the noise you just made,

01:20:21.130 --> 01:20:22.158
you were all like...

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.128
Here, take this.

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:29.200
Yeah. Let's go.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.180
- Spread the C
- 4 out. I'll blow it when he comes through.

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:38.198
Mo, over here. Come on. Hurry up.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.190
He's coming.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.050
- Okay, come on. Come on.
- Oh, shit.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.180
Okay, come on. Let's go.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.000
Oh, shit.

01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:03.128
I hate this guy.

01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:07.138
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.040
There is no way out.

01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:12.150
Mo, give me the triggers.

01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:19.080
Hey, Nusbaum!

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.028
I quit.

01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:33.158
Oh, shit. -Did either of you
put detonators into the C-4?

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.010
Why doesn't anybody tell me these things?

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.150
Desmond!

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:47.168
- You fail to realize...
- Move!

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:48.160
that I...

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.218
am too big...

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:54.020
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on!
- ...to fail!

01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:24.040
Holy moley.

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.018
Fuck you.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.140
Oh!

01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:41.090
Well, you were finally
on time for something.

01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:44.160
I finally had something
to be on time for.

01:22:46.190 --> 01:22:48.028
Oh, don't.

01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:49.070
Please don't.

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:52.228
Okay, that's happening.

01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:54.028
So I'm just gonna...

01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:55.168
Oh, okay.

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:57.228
Okay, I... I-I'll just be back here,

01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:59.160
throwing up in my hands.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.028
Don't make me wait another 15 years

01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:17.028
before you do that again.

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:18.050
Deal.

01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:23.088
And why did you show Mo
your video game and not me?

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:24.150
Because Mo's a nerd.

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.108
- I'm a nerd.
- Okay.

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:28.140
Check it out.

01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:43.078
- It's so...
- Silly.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.110
You.

01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:48.148
Ah. Oh, that feels so good.

01:23:48.150 --> 01:23:51.190
Oh! You guys have got to try this. Oh.
