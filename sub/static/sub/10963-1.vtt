You guys are doin' this all
the time and it's bullshit!

43:43.760 --> 43:45.000
I'm tired of it, you gotta go.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.570
Icanleave,lcanleave.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.244
I can also bang down a
couple of these doors

43:48.320 --> 43:50.004
around here just
for the hell of it.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.128
See what I find. You know
what I bet, I bet there's lots

43:52.200 --> 43:54.601
of terrified illegals
hiding in here

43:54.680 --> 43:57.081
who have no other choice
but to live in this shithole

43:57.160 --> 43:59.447
with a slumlord, because
he takes advantage of them

43:59.520 --> 44:02.444
'cause he knows they probably can't
rent very many other places.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.443
And you may be paying off
people at Building and Safety.

44:04.520 --> 44:08.047
I guarantee you, I can get this
place shut down in 24 hours.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.966
You can go to jail. Your filthy little
lawyer won't even hear from you

44:12.040 --> 44:13.690
before you've had
a chance to spend

44:13.760 --> 44:15.444
one fun-filled night
in a cell block

44:15.520 --> 44:17.727
with a man named
Marcus in King County.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.285
How does that sound?

44:20.640 --> 44:21.641
[speaking foreign language]

44:21.760 --> 44:22.807
What?

44:22.880 --> 44:25.645
[speaking foreign language]

44:25.720 --> 44:29.645
That's the name of the man that was
supposed to take his son to Russia.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.006
Vladislav Pavel.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.003
[speaking foreign language]

44:33.080 --> 44:35.242
He's the photo on your phone.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.723
He lives in this building.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.765
[alarm buzzes]

44:53.840 --> 44:55.649
You have anything
metal on your person?

44:55.720 --> 44:56.687
Just this.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.125
[guard] Gun!

44:59.560 --> 45:01.403
[shouting and grunting]

45:10.440 --> 45:11.771
[groaning]

45:12.760 --> 45:13.682
M a ka rov?

45:13.760 --> 45:15.046
- I don't--
- [Ray] Where?

45:15.120 --> 45:17.964
- I don't.
- Where? Where?

45:18.040 --> 45:19.769
- Upstairs.
- Room.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.650
- Room!
- End of the hall.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.131
[groans]

45:31.960 --> 45:33.769
[grunting]

45:49.880 --> 45:51.484
[speaking foreign language]

45:58.800 --> 46:00.689
- [groans]
- [screams]

46:06.000 --> 46:07.047
Who are you?

46:07.160 --> 46:08.571
[grunting]

46:08.640 --> 46:10.369
The guy who decides if
you live or die today.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.090
Sit down, down!

46:13.600 --> 46:15.568
I am Russian Consul General.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.768
I have diplomatic immunity.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.844
[groaning]

46:22.400 --> 46:24.004
[shoufing]

46:30.600 --> 46:32.807
Funny, you don't look immune.

46:32.880 --> 46:34.325
[groaning]

46:35.960 --> 46:38.611
A good friend of
ours, Nikolai Koskei,

46:38.680 --> 46:41.001
he swears on his
life that you dabble

46:41.080 --> 46:43.162
in stolen Russian
military weapons, plastics

46:43.240 --> 46:44.321
- chemicals, explosives.
- No!

46:44.400 --> 46:45.845
Among other things.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.649
Now normally this
type of information

46:47.720 --> 46:48.926
would go to the proper channels.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.764
[groaning]

46:50.840 --> 46:53.764
An investigation would take
place, payoffs would be made,

46:53.840 --> 46:56.810
and you'd go about your business
minus a couple of bucks.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.723
But today's a little
bit different.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.609
You see, some Russian junkie

47:00.680 --> 47:02.364
strapped a whole lot
of your explosives

47:02.440 --> 47:03.930
to an innocent little boy

47:04.000 --> 47:06.207
and it's gonna go off
in less than four hours,

47:06.280 --> 47:07.850
which is four more
than you're gonna live

47:07.920 --> 47:09.684
if you don't give me
the name of someone

47:09.760 --> 47:12.491
who would build a device like
that no questions asked.

47:12.600 --> 47:15.410
You're a dead man.
Do you know this?

47:15.520 --> 47:17.284
[groaning]

47:17.360 --> 47:20.887
I'm a hard guy to take down.

47:20.960 --> 47:25.682
Officially, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

47:25.760 --> 47:26.727
[knocking]

47:26.800 --> 47:28.245
[groaning]

47:30.040 --> 47:31.166
[knocking]

47:31.240 --> 47:32.969
How about unofficially?

47:35.200 --> 47:39.364
Go see Slava the bomb-maker
that lives in Fremont.

47:40.480 --> 47:43.006
[shouting foreign language]

47:43.080 --> 47:45.367
Listen, listen,
your boss man here,

47:45.440 --> 47:47.283
he's got a broken nose
and a pen in his leg.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.089
He's gonna be fine,
it's gonna heal.

47:49.160 --> 47:52.289
I just wanna get
out of here, okay?

47:52.360 --> 47:53.282
I just want--

47:53.360 --> 47:54.805
[guns fire]

47:55.760 --> 47:57.888
[sirens wail]

48:00.600 --> 48:03.285
No one gets paid enough
to be a hero here, okay?

48:03.400 --> 48:05.004
Especially not me!

48:05.080 --> 48:08.368
Your boss here is gonna
bleed out in 10 minutes.

48:10.040 --> 48:12.486
Focus on saving your boss.

48:12.560 --> 48:14.289
[groaning]

48:15.560 --> 48:17.164
[sirens wail]

48:23.080 --> 48:24.366
[cell phone beeps]

48:24.440 --> 48:27.444
What? Yeah, yeah,
as far as you know.

48:27.520 --> 48:31.161
Okay, where? Where?

48:31.240 --> 48:32.605
[mutters indistinct]

48:35.320 --> 48:36.606
[tires squeal]

48:47.160 --> 48:50.926
Hey, hey, someone recognized
the kid, Anatoly. He's seven.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.002
They lD'd our bomber,
Vladislav Pavel.

48:53.080 --> 48:54.684
He lived in the room
right above him.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.728
- You call it in?
- No, I guess I forgot to.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.929
Iguessitsfifl takes four hours
to get an expedited warrant.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.490
Get anywhere on my
Tacoma extortion case?

49:06.560 --> 49:08.369
Yeah, both your
Russian nationals

49:08.440 --> 49:10.124
are being held at King County.

49:10.200 --> 49:13.329
ADA was negotiating a plea deal.
ICE got involved.

49:13.400 --> 49:17.325
One of the suspects is wanted for murder
back in Russia so they deported him.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.563
- Got any names? - Still waiting
for the feds to send the file.

49:24.680 --> 49:27.570
Well, that's his room.

49:27.640 --> 49:29.404
If you want any of his
shit, just let me know.

49:29.480 --> 49:32.290
- Okay.
- I'll get ya a good price.

50:03.440 --> 50:06.091
Looks like he was
applying for political asylum.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.524
Guess it didn't go through.

50:16.920 --> 50:22.165
Ooh, it looks like someone had quite
the man crush on you, officer.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.571
What?

50:28.600 --> 50:30.648
Ooh, is this our kid?

50:32.840 --> 50:34.046
No.

50:37.520 --> 50:39.010
Someone else's.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.205
We need to see your basement.

50:55.320 --> 50:58.005
- Whatever.
- The boy could be there.

51:05.480 --> 51:08.689
- [Ray] Anyone ever come down here?
- [landlord] No, just rats.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.122
[Ray] I don't see Anatoly.

51:40.360 --> 51:41.850
[Julia] We have to look.

51:57.960 --> 52:00.008
He's not here.

52:00.080 --> 52:03.163
- Where are we going?
- Got the address of a bomb maker.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.527
From a very cooperative
Russian diplomat.

52:05.640 --> 52:07.244
Wait, what?

52:07.320 --> 52:08.970
You gotta be kiddin' me.

52:10.160 --> 52:11.685
Hey, someone 'jacked my truck.

52:11.760 --> 52:14.445
That's a $40,000 truck!
Damn it!

52:14.520 --> 52:16.045
Hey, just get in,
I'll call it in.

52:16.120 --> 52:17.645
Aw, come on, no
one saw anything?

52:17.720 --> 52:19.643
Just ride with me,
we'll call it in.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.370
This city's a sewer.

52:22.920 --> 52:25.207
[engine starts]

52:26.520 --> 52:27.726
[tires squeak]

52:29.520 --> 52:31.204
[Ray] There is nothing in
our arrest records

52:31.280 --> 52:32.327
about a Vladislav Pavel.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.926
Oh, come on, P-A-V-E--

52:35.000 --> 52:37.002
I know how to spell it.
It's not in there.

52:37.080 --> 52:39.082
Why don't you check the
sexual offenders database?

52:39.160 --> 52:40.525
First thing I did, dead end.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.682
Send it to
Jennifer Mahr in my contacts.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.889
- Mahr, M-A-H-E-R? - H-R, there
isn't even another one in there.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.928
[Ray] M-A-H-R.
Got it.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.843
[Julia] Good, she can access
all of our databases

52:49.920 --> 52:52.241
and we get us a facial
recognition match.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.005
We also need to follow up on the
warrant request for the server logs.

52:55.080 --> 52:58.846
- On it. - Check and find out
whatever happened to PavePs

52:58.920 --> 53:00.160
application for amnesty.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.486
There's gotta be
something in there.

53:01.560 --> 53:02.891
Got it.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.249
[Julia] This the place?

53:16.320 --> 53:18.482
11391, that's it.

53:21.760 --> 53:23.000
Hello?

53:26.520 --> 53:27.760
[Julia] Police.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.283
[Ray] Police, anyone here?

53:37.880 --> 53:39.166
[Julia] SPD.

53:42.040 --> 53:44.042
[knocking]

53:44.120 --> 53:45.485
[Ray] Police.

53:47.600 --> 53:48.886
[door creaks]

54:02.120 --> 54:03.360
Slava?

54:05.080 --> 54:06.286
Slava?

54:12.720 --> 54:14.370
[TV chattering]

54:20.440 --> 54:21.680
Slava?

54:34.320 --> 54:35.970
You Slava?

54:36.040 --> 54:37.610
I am Slava.

54:37.680 --> 54:41.401
No last name, like
Usher and Beyonce.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.482
Fantastic. I'm Ray.

54:43.560 --> 54:46.643
Middle and last names
both besides the point.

54:46.760 --> 54:48.330
Who is the pretty lady?

54:48.400 --> 54:50.004
[Ray] She's a police officer.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.161
She's helping me on a case.

54:51.240 --> 54:52.730
We're trying to find a boy.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.325
Oh, very pretty.

54:56.120 --> 54:59.488
Alexander Makarov. He told me you'd
have some information for me.

54:59.560 --> 55:02.803
You know, your friend from
the Russian Consulate?

55:02.880 --> 55:07.044
Yes, Mr. Makarov contacted me.
He's very angry with you.

55:07.120 --> 55:11.489
Said I should blow you up
and mail him your pieces.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.005
Good price, too.

55:14.280 --> 55:15.725
That sounds just like him.

55:15.800 --> 55:17.165
I don't like him either.

55:17.240 --> 55:21.165
He's Russian, I'm Ukrainian,
from Kiev.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.368
He was appointed by Putin.

55:23.440 --> 55:26.011
Just wanna ask you about
a bomb you may have built.

55:26.080 --> 55:27.650
Vladislav Pavel.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.569
I made many bombs
for many people.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.045
That's what I do.

55:31.120 --> 55:32.929
For people who want to
blow up their bosses

55:33.000 --> 55:37.722
or their boats or
businesses for insurance.

55:39.760 --> 55:41.250
A picture of it right here.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.289
Yeah, it is mine.

55:50.360 --> 55:53.842
Four liter chlorine azide.
Makes a very big boom.

55:53.920 --> 56:00.280
Unstable, too. And there is bias
voltage set up on the harness clasp.

56:00.360 --> 56:04.445
So if you try to
remove it, boom.

56:04.520 --> 56:07.842
Looks like he mounted it right.

56:07.920 --> 56:11.208
- How long ago was he here?
- Uh, 10 days, maybe less.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.362
He say anything
about what it was for?

56:13.440 --> 56:15.442
For getting even.

56:15.520 --> 56:17.966
That's all I know,
I don't ask question,

56:18.040 --> 56:19.690
I just build what they want.

56:19.760 --> 56:22.969
Okay, listen,
you old, old man.

56:23.040 --> 56:26.328
That bomb that you built is now
strapped to a seven year old little boy

56:26.400 --> 56:28.084
and it's supposed
to go off in, oh,

56:28.160 --> 56:30.162
just under an hour
and a half from now,

56:30.280 --> 56:31.805
so we don't really
have time for this.

56:31.880 --> 56:33.609
So how 'bout I just
put this in your mouth

56:33.680 --> 56:35.523
and pull the trigger like
I'm doing a load of laundry.

56:37.760 --> 56:39.250
Then I would be dead.

56:41.040 --> 56:43.168
I would like to help you.

56:43.240 --> 56:45.720
I don't like to kill children.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.246
But I only know what I know.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.130
So if you do find the boy,

56:51.200 --> 56:54.807
you want to immobilize the latch

56:54.880 --> 56:56.723
before you remove it.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.762
And if it makes you feel better,

56:59.840 --> 57:03.925
I never cashed that paycheck
he signed over to me.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.163
I am sometimes not about money.

57:07.880 --> 57:09.450
What check?

57:14.280 --> 57:15.611
[Julia] What was it?

57:15.680 --> 57:17.728
Noble Custom Cut,
Four Harbor Drive.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.521
[siren chirps]

57:26.000 --> 57:27.968
How you doin', Ray?

57:28.040 --> 57:29.371
You're not returning any calls.

57:29.440 --> 57:30.885
Been kinda busy.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.803
[Kendricks]
Captain wants to see you.

57:32.880 --> 57:35.451
[Ray] Well, arrest the guy
inside, he's the bomb maker.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.841
- [Kendricks] Cut the crap.
- I'll call him later.

57:37.920 --> 57:40.207
[Kendricks] Hey, he
wants me to bring you in.

57:40.280 --> 57:42.362
Good luck with that.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.204
There's no answer.

57:45.680 --> 57:48.001
- [Pepper spray hisses]
' [Ray grunts]

57:48.960 --> 57:51.440
God!

57:51.520 --> 57:53.045
[choking]

57:54.240 --> 57:56.971
[Ray] Kendricks!
[grunting]

57:57.040 --> 57:59.008
- Guys, hey!
' [Ray groans]

57:59.120 --> 58:02.249
Kendricks, easy, hey,
why are you takin' him in?

58:02.320 --> 58:03.560
Ask the captain.

58:03.640 --> 58:05.449
[Roy groans]

58:05.520 --> 58:06.567
Come on!

58:06.640 --> 58:08.449
[Roy moans]

58:14.520 --> 58:16.602
[Kendricks] You're lucky
you didn't catch a bullet.

58:16.720 --> 58:19.326
Yeah, there's a lot
of that goin' around.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.290
You want your rep or
lawyer, I can arrange that.

58:22.360 --> 58:24.647
I don't need a lawyer.
I need to find Vladislav Pavel.

58:24.720 --> 58:28.167
We know where he works. You need to
get Cronin to send a unit there now.

58:28.240 --> 58:31.961
We will. You have a grudge
against this department?

58:32.040 --> 58:33.565
You figure the
department owes you?

58:33.640 --> 58:35.642
Yeah, about 200
hours of overtime.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.449
But who's counting?

58:39.480 --> 58:40.845
Is that yours?

58:40.920 --> 58:42.763
Nope, mine's right here.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.569
We found that in
your desk drawer.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.290
Yeah, well, it's not mine.

58:46.360 --> 58:49.250
Is that your name
and post office box address?

58:49.320 --> 58:51.288
I don't have a PO box.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.010
How would you describe
your relationship

58:53.080 --> 58:55.651
with your fellow officers?

58:55.760 --> 58:56.886
You know what my
relationship is.

58:56.960 --> 58:58.610
I work my ass off.

59:00.640 --> 59:04.167
Why don't we go back to
August 7th, three years ago?

59:04.240 --> 59:05.685
When your son died.

59:06.640 --> 59:08.483
When he was killed.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.166
At a homicide division picnic.

59:12.360 --> 59:13.486
You don't think I
see that every night

59:13.560 --> 59:15.562
when I shut my eyes?

59:15.640 --> 59:18.962
He was playing on the streets, fellow
cop had a few too many, hit him, right?

59:19.040 --> 59:21.691
He was twice the legal limit
with two DUls under his belt.

59:21.760 --> 59:24.445
And you sued the
city for $2,000,000.

59:26.720 --> 59:28.290
How'd that case go?

59:31.480 --> 59:35.201
And then your wife
left you for another cop.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.886
You poured yourself
into your work.

59:37.960 --> 59:41.043
A lot of guys didn't
like your methods.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.088
Must be carryin'
a lot of built-up anger.

59:43.160 --> 59:45.288
More by the minute.

59:45.360 --> 59:47.249
There are 121 phone calls
to the dead bomber

59:47.320 --> 59:49.800
over the course of a
year from your cellphone.

59:49.880 --> 59:52.087
[Ray] I told you,
that's not my cellphone.

59:52.160 --> 59:54.731
[Kendricks] The bill was paid with a check
from your account at Dominion Trust.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.201
- I don't have an account there.
- Opened 13 months ago.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.481
Is that your signature?

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.722
[Julia]
Detective Baker.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.041
[Jennifer] Hello, Julia,
this is Jennifer Mahr.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.930
In response to your email, I
am sending you the only Pavel

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.525
we have in our database.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.171
But his name is
Igor not Vladisla v.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.170
He set me up.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.650
Just in case.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.643
Why would he do that?

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.051
Do you believe I did this, Al?

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.246
Don't you think
I'd cover my tracks

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.810
a little bit better than this?

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.360
If this was my deal, you
wouldn't find a thing.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.769
How long you
been planning this?

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.928
I shoulda shot
you in the head.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.604
You know what I think?

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.610
I think, after Mikey
died, you lost it.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.884
You roll on this Russian, decide to
blackmail the city to get what's yours.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.691
Maybe he's got a bone to
pick with the department.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.161
Maybe he's just
weak in the head.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.891
Either way, you sell
him on your worldview,

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.803
stoke that fire,
pump him full of hate,

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.406
give him a plan and a
chance at an easy payday.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.562
The buck 12 and
change, you tack on

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.166
to give it just that
little edge of crazy.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.129
Now the b0mber's dead.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.929
You see he can't make
it outwith your money.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.247
You shoot him in the head.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.245
Like a soldier.
So no witnesses.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.443
You know I don't know
where that kid is, right?

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.363
That died with the Russian.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.848
The only thing I know

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.049
is that you wanna
do the right thing.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.010
You're right, I do.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.644
- Captain, you wanna see this.
- Not right now.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.370
No, right now's a
good time I think.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.487
It's actually kind of important.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.324
It's pertinent information!

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.449
He's right there.
Fourth floor, center stairwell.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.285
[grunting]

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.124
[groaning]

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.246
- Hold it, Ray, don't do it!
- We got eyes on him!

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.971
No, no, don't do it!

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.520
[man] He jumped down,
he jumped down the floor.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.810
[grunting]

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.527
Hands, put your hands up now!

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.728
Freeze right there, turn around!

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.531
Get the fuck on the ground now!

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.284
Down on the ground now.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.089
[grunting and groaning]

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.245
[crashing]

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.330
[grunting]

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.283
You're gonna get
yourself killed, Ray.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.527
- Give it up.
- Okay.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.647
It's over.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.642
" Qkay_
" Qkay?

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.881
I'm sorry.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.610
[groaning]

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.402
Gimme that!

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.720
[gun clicks]

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.200
You had your chance.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.850
- [gun fires]
" [Ray groans]

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.963
Want another one, huh?

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.805
- [gun fires]
- [Ray shouts]

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.927
How's that feel, huh?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.128
- [Ray groans]
- Want more?

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.248
- [gun fires]
- [Ray shouts and groans]

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.165
- What are you doin', man?
- Give it up, Ray!

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.607
- Get off of me!
- What are you doin'?

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.284
Stop, Ray, I'll still shoot.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.203
[man screams]

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.047
Hey, hey! Get in!

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.724
[car horn honks]

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.320
Get in!

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.726
[tires squeal]

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.522
- Why are ya doin' this?
- $112.35.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.329
What?

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.448
Russians, the fraud and extortion
ring you busted in Tacoma?

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.204
Yes, yes, the case I
told you to look up, yes.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.770
Well, the guy
that they deported,

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.286
he had $112.35 in his
pocket when you booked him.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.805
Gotta tell you, lieutenant,
that is a real shitty reason

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.370
for you to be in a
car with me right now.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.728
Okay, what about
$2,000,112.35, ring a bell?

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.040
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Correct?

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.168
Okay, so $2,000,000
implicate you

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.686
and $112.35 for his brother.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.965
What, whose brother?

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.247
The guy you busted,
the guy they deported,

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.971
his last name is Pavel,
he's the b0mber's brother.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.724
He was wanted back in
Mother Russia for murder

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.609
so it wasn't the bomber
applying for asylum,

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.330
it was actually his brother.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.370
Once he got deported, they hung
him a month later in Russia.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.965
That's what you're paying for.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.328
- It's a blood debt.
- Takes all kinds.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.085
[Ray] We need to follow that
paycheck that wasn't cashed.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.844
Anatoly might be there.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.851
[engine roars]

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.769
[door creaks]

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.481
Hey, what are you doin'?
This is a restricted area.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.403
SPD.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.970
Lookin' for this guy.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.881
Shit, Vlad.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.405
Yeah, so he works here?

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.766
Well judging from
the hole in his head,

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.808
I guess he doesn't
work here anymore.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.006
What did he do?

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.923
He was our night watchman.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.650
Guy was a fruit loop.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.882
This place is
flypaper for freaks.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.962
So he woulda been the
only one here at nights?

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.806
Yeah, that's the idea.
At night, keepin' people out.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.086
We need to see all your
outbuildings,

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.889
anyplace he could've
hidden something.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.883
How much time you got?

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.962
Forty-three minutes
and 22 seconds.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.204
Hey, it's Blake,
they're here, man.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.249
Yeah, the ones
you're lookin' for.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.007
I don't know, you want me
to hold on to 'em here?

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.445
[Ray] Anatoly!

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.249
This place is huge.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.765
I'll check in here.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.721
'Toly?

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.491
An atoly!

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.006
An atoly!

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:39.606
An atoly.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.930
[Julia]
Ray!

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.765
Gotta call this in.
We need more people.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.171
[Ray]
Anatoly!

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:50.441
An atoly!

01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.167
Shit.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.164
Ray! Ray!

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.526
Thompson!

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.126
Thompson! Gotta go!

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.607
Thompson!
We gotta go!

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.250
[Ray] What is it?

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.841
It better be good.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.285
[tires squeal]

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.964
He worked in the police
maintenance department

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.964
for 46 days, he
applied as Yuri Alexi,

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.441
with matching documents,
matching social.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.646
They're pretty confident
it's the same guy.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.967
Same man on the video.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.444
That's how he got
the kid inside.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.126
That's Vladislav Pavel,
that's our kidnapper.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.802
We also got the logs from
the server in Belarus.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.848
Turns out the signal was
relaying through a computer

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.922
at police headquarters,
your computer.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.048
He was keeping him in the
very last place we'd look.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.487
We gotta call this in to EOD.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.884
Are those our guys?

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.330
[engine roars]

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.203
[speaking foreign language]

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.244
[Ray] Come on,
they're right behind us!

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.964
Go, go!

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.010
Comin' up on my side.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.440
Watch out.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.009
[speaking foreign language]

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.166
Careful.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.365
They're comin' up on each side.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.766
Do you know where you're going?

I'd probably laugh in your ugly

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.686
Today's the day, three
years ago, my son died.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.685
And you are
telling me this why?

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.842
Three years ago, my son
was playing in the street.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.526
He was playing football.
A car was coming.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.523
I saw the car, I saw
the driver's eyes,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.730
I saw it all, so I ran
and I was too late.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.604
Three to four seconds too late.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.330
I live with those seconds
every day of my life,

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.289
wishing I could get them back.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.761
But the truth is I can't.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.285
So I swore on my son's memory

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.761
I would never be late
again, you understand me?

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.922

what you're talkin' about.

give, even your life,

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.961
you can never get it back.

life is all about timing.

- What man?
- Doesn't matter.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.650
What matters is that
mine was shitty once

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.563

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.729
