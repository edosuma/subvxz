WEBVTT

00:09.090 --> 00:11.841
OH! SORRY! THE TOWN
HALL MEETING RAN LATE.

00:11.842 --> 00:13.513
WE HAD TO VOTE SIX TIMES
ON WHETHER OR NOT

00:13.514 --> 00:16.015
SOME OLD LADY COULD PRUNE HER
SHRUBBERY TO LOOK LIKE APHRODITE

00:16.016 --> 00:17.897
AND ADONIS HITTING
IT DOGGY STYLE.

00:17.898 --> 00:19.849
HOW'D THE VOTE GO?

00:19.850 --> 00:21.561
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:21.562 --> 00:23.022
IS GONNA HAVE TO
REROUTE THEIR BUSES.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.985
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS I'M HERE FOR US ALL

00:25.986 --> 00:28.648
TO VIDEO CHAT WITH RYDER AND WISH
HIM A HAPPY EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY!

00:28.649 --> 00:30.450
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO, UM...
- YES!

00:30.451 --> 00:32.612
ACTIVATE! COMPUTER! GO!

00:32.613 --> 00:35.455
WELL, IF YOU'RE
GONNA CHARM ME...

00:35.456 --> 00:38.958
WHERE'S DANI? WE ALL WROTE THE BIRTHDAY SONG
TOGETHER, WE ALL HAVE TO SING IT TO HIM.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.422
I'LL INVITE HER. YO, DANI!

00:42.713 --> 00:46.836
WHAT? IN MY FAMILY, THAT'S
A FORMAL INVITATION.

00:46.837 --> 00:50.380
IF THIS IS ABOUT THE MATH TEST, I HAVE
A TOTALLY LEGITIMATE EXPLANATION.

00:50.381 --> 00:53.973
- WHAT MATH TEST?
- (laughs) EXACTLY.

00:53.974 --> 00:56.476
WHAT MATH TEST?

00:56.477 --> 00:58.308
- DANI... OH! IT'S CONNECTING.
- (beeping)

00:58.309 --> 01:01.020
WE GOT RYDER IN NEW ORLEANS.

01:01.021 --> 01:03.062
- (computer chimes)
- Hey, guys!

01:03.063 --> 01:04.104
All: HEY!

01:04.105 --> 01:05.565
Uh... what's hap...

01:05.566 --> 01:06.986
(computer chimes)

01:06.987 --> 01:09.569
OH, "CALL FAILED."
THAT'S A RELIEF.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.113
I THOUGHT RYDER HAD A STROKE.
JOE, MAKE THE INTERNET WORK!

01:13.114 --> 01:16.497
OKAY, CALM DOWN, MEL. VIDEO CHATS
NEVER GO THROUGH THE FIRST TIME.

01:18.409 --> 01:23.293
- OR THE NINTH TIME.
- TENTH, BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

01:23.294 --> 01:25.004
(theme music playing)

01:25.005 --> 01:26.466
- ♪ IT'S ALL GOOD ♪
- ♪ All good ♪

01:26.467 --> 01:28.258

01:29.970 --> 01:31.841

01:31.842 --> 01:33.303

01:39.930 --> 01:42.933

01:46.567 --> 01:50.990
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WATCH 24, THERE'S
NEVER A GLITCH WITH THEIR VIDEO CALLS.

01:50.991 --> 01:54.864
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE
THAT AWESOME PRETEND INTERNET.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.287
I ACTUALLY THINK I FIGURED OUT A WAY
THAT WE CAN REACH RYDER, THOUGH.

01:57.288 --> 02:00.740
- OH. GOOD, WHAT DO I DO?
- WE'RE GONNA CALL HIM.

02:00.741 --> 02:02.582
ON THE PHONE.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.043
BUT THEN I WON'T
BE ABLE TO SEE HIM

02:04.044 --> 02:07.377
AND WITNESS THAT MOMENT WHEN HE
TRANSITIONS FROM BOY TO MAN.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.249
YEAH, HONEY, I THINK
THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED,

02:09.250 --> 02:12.922
AND LUCKILY WE WEREN'T
THERE TO WITNESS THAT.

02:12.923 --> 02:14.924
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S A
BIG DEAL TO YOU.

02:14.925 --> 02:17.096
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY, BUT WE CAN
JUST CALL HIM ON THE PHONE.

02:17.097 --> 02:18.678
THAT'S JUST AS GOOD
AS A VIDEO CALL.

02:18.679 --> 02:21.891
YOU'RE RIGHT. A
PHONE CALL IS FINE.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.974
I'M SORRY. GIVE ME A
KISS, YOU BIG STUD.

02:24.975 --> 02:28.568
- MM...
- OR MAYBE I'LL JUST WAVE.

02:28.569 --> 02:31.030
AND MAYBE INSTEAD OF SEX,
WE CAN JUST HIGH FIVE.

02:31.031 --> 02:34.274
HONEY, HONEY. LOOK, I KNOW
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO YOU.

02:34.275 --> 02:35.905
BUT WE TRIED. I TRIED SKYPE.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.117
I TRIED FACETIME. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

02:38.118 --> 02:41.201
YOU KNOW WHAT? OKAY.
MAYBE IT'S THE ROUTER.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.952
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL UNPLUG
IT, WE CAN RESET IT.

02:42.953 --> 02:44.994
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IT SHOULD
TAKE, LIKE, THREE MINUTES.

02:44.995 --> 02:48.047
THREE MINUTES? THAT'S FOREVER. WHAT
ARE WE GONNA DO FOR THREE MINUTES?

02:48.048 --> 02:52.712
WE COULD HARD BOIL
AN EGG, OR, UH...

02:52.713 --> 02:55.425
YOU KNOW, WE COULD
HAVE SOME SEX.

02:55.426 --> 02:59.009
IS IT JUST ME, OR SINCE MARRIAGE
HAS YOUR GAME GONE WAY DOWNHILL?

02:59.930 --> 03:02.302
LENNOX, CAN I GET
A LITTLE ADVICE?

03:02.303 --> 03:04.354
WAIT, YOU'RE ASKING
ME FOR ADVICE?

03:04.355 --> 03:07.897
YOU GREW UP ON THE ROAD WITH ROCK BANDS.
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW EVERYTHING.

03:07.898 --> 03:11.190
I KNOW WHAT GENE SIMMONS
LOOKS LIKE IN SPANX,

03:11.191 --> 03:15.024
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BOYS UNDER 60.

03:15.025 --> 03:17.487
OKAY, THAT'S AN
IMAGE I DON'T NEED,

03:17.488 --> 03:20.580
BUT I'M ALL EARS.

03:20.581 --> 03:23.743
WELL, I TEXTED THIS BOY,
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HANGING OUT,

03:23.744 --> 03:24.994
AND HE HASN'T TEXT ME BACK.

03:24.995 --> 03:27.957
SO WHEN I TEXT HIM AGAIN,
WHAT SHOULD I SAY?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.249
DON'T SAY ANYTHING,

03:29.250 --> 03:31.000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
LOOK LIKE A DESPERATE FREAK,

03:31.001 --> 03:33.423
AND THERE'S NO RECOVERING
FROM THE DOUBLE TEXT.

03:33.424 --> 03:37.837
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- IT HAPPENED TO ME.

03:37.838 --> 03:40.009
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

03:40.010 --> 03:42.722
IT WAS A FLIP PHONE.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.725
A WHAT?

03:49.149 --> 03:50.980
CAN WE PLUG IT IN NOW?

03:50.981 --> 03:53.983
NO, IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO MINUTES
AND 17 SECONDS. OKAY?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.905
THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE IS 29.9.

03:55.906 --> 03:59.739
OH, AND IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME IN JAKARTA.
(laughs) I LOVE MY WATCH.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.821
GUESS WHAT?

04:01.822 --> 04:04.073
DANI JUST CAME TO ME FOR
ADVICE, AND I GAVE IT TO HER.

04:04.074 --> 04:06.866
AH! NOW I KNOW THE SATISFACTION
YOU FEEL WHEN YOU GIVE ME ADVICE.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.919
OH, HONEY, I DON'T GIVE YOU ADVICE
FOR THE FEELING OF SATISFACTION.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.332
I GIVE IT TO YOU FOR THE
FEELING OF SUPERIORITY.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.754
NO, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST FOR
THE FIRST TIME I FEEL LIKE

04:14.755 --> 04:16.966
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO
HAVE A LITTLE SISTER.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.468
OH! THIS IS SO WONDERFUL!

04:18.469 --> 04:21.090
I HAVE MENTORED YOU
INTO BECOMING A MENTOR!

04:21.091 --> 04:25.014
WOW. HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO MAKE
THIS ABOUT YOU SO QUICKLY?

04:25.015 --> 04:26.766
SOMEDAY, I'LL TEACH YOU.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.018
- HOW ABOUT NOW?
- THIS IS NOT A TOASTER, HONEY.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.891
ALL RIGHT? THIS IS A PRECISION
PIECE OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT.

04:31.892 --> 04:33.653
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, READY?

04:33.654 --> 04:37.157
SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE...

04:38.899 --> 04:40.109
CLOSE ENOUGH.

04:40.110 --> 04:43.242
- OH! OKAY. HERE WE GO.
- (computer chimes)

04:43.243 --> 04:46.536
AND THE INTERNET IS BACK TO FULL...
TRICKLE. WHAT?

04:46.537 --> 04:48.408
I DON'T GET IT!

04:48.409 --> 04:50.580
WELL, YOU DID
EVERYTHING YOU COULD.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.912
I MEAN, NO ONE COULD
HAVE DONE ANY MORE.

04:52.913 --> 04:54.964
EXCEPT MAYBE A PROFESSIONAL,
WHICH IS WHY I THINK

04:54.965 --> 04:57.297
IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD THING
RIGHT NOW TO CALL JIFFY NERDS.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.591
THE GUYS IN THE
ORANGE SMART CARS?

05:01.592 --> 05:04.924
THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL NERDS, ANY CAR
THEY GET IN IS GONNA BE SMART.

05:04.925 --> 05:06.516
I CAN FIX THIS MYSELF, MEL.

05:06.517 --> 05:10.189
JOE, DARLING, TENDER
JOE, I LOVE YOU.

05:10.190 --> 05:13.984
AND EVEN IF YOU CAN'T FIX EVERYTHING
IN THE HOUSE, I WILL STILL LOVE YOU.

05:16.857 --> 05:19.439
THAT IS THE CRUELEST THING
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.571
OH, HEY, YOU GUYS,
I JUST TEXT RYDER.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.903
AND HE'S GOING OUT WITH HIS FRIENDS
LATER, BUT HE'S HOME RIGHT NOW.

05:23.904 --> 05:25.865
SO WE CAN JUST TEXT
HIM "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."

05:25.866 --> 05:27.997
LENNOX, DO NOT GO THERE.

05:27.998 --> 05:30.249
TEXT HIM "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"?

05:30.250 --> 05:32.041
TOO LATE.

05:32.042 --> 05:34.714
WHY DON'T WE JUST GET SOME CANDLES
AND STICK THEM IN SOME DOG POO?

05:34.715 --> 05:36.876
'CAUSE THAT'S THE SAME
THING AS CAKE, RIGHT?

05:36.877 --> 05:39.419
HEY, RYDER WILL EAT
ALMOST ANYTHING.

05:39.420 --> 05:42.962
OKAY, WE ARE NOT DOING
THIS BY PHONE, OR BY TEXT.

05:42.963 --> 05:46.095
WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING TO OUR LOVED
ONE ON THE BIG COMPUTER SCREEN,

05:46.096 --> 05:50.229
ALL OF US, FACE TO VIRTUAL FACE!
ANY QUESTIONS?

05:50.230 --> 05:51.432
THE ANSWER IS "NO."

05:52.893 --> 05:54.564
I THINK I FOUND OUT WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS. HA!

05:54.565 --> 05:56.105
I JUST NEED TO UPDATE
OUR OPERATING SYSTEM.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.737
HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?

05:57.738 --> 06:00.069
FASTER THAN A NERD CAN GET
HERE IN A SMART CAR, BABY.

06:00.070 --> 06:01.611
(beeping)

06:01.612 --> 06:03.903
THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT,
DOWNLOAD WILL BE COMPLETE IN...

06:03.904 --> 06:05.785
FIVE MINUTES. YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:05.786 --> 06:07.156
- (computer beeps)
- OH. THREE MINUTES.

06:07.157 --> 06:08.448
YEAH. I'M AWESOME.

06:08.449 --> 06:10.159
- (beeps)
- TWELVE MINUTES.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.453
- UM... TWO HOURS.
- (beeping)

06:13.454 --> 06:16.586
- 300 HOURS? -HOW IS IT GOING UP?
JOE, DO SOMETHING!

06:16.587 --> 06:19.839
I'M TRYING! ABORT, ABORT! INTERRUPT SCRIPT!
HOLD ON! WAIT A MINUTE! OH!

06:19.840 --> 06:22.502
HEY! I GOT IT. OKAY. I
JUST STOPPED THE DOWNLOAD!

06:22.503 --> 06:24.554
- (laughs) -WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS, JACK BAUER.

06:24.555 --> 06:26.005
AND THIS HELPS US HOW?

06:26.006 --> 06:27.967
HOW? BECAUSE NOW WE DEFINITELY
KNOW IT'S THE ROUTER, HONEY.

06:27.968 --> 06:31.892
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING I
KNOW ABOUT ROUTERS, IT'S...

06:33.604 --> 06:35.605
ROUTERS. TRUST ME.

06:35.606 --> 06:37.938
OF COURSE I TRUST YOU.

06:38.939 --> 06:40.359
HELLO, JIFFY NERDS?

06:40.360 --> 06:42.071
I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.
MY NAME IS...

06:42.072 --> 06:45.194
YOU ALREADY KNOW MY NAME?
AND MY ADDRESS?

06:45.195 --> 06:47.868
WOW, YOU GUYS ARE GOOD.

06:52.583 --> 06:56.496
(air hissing)

06:56.497 --> 06:59.839
WOW. LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY THREW A
TEENY-TINY HAND GRENADE AT YOUR ROUTER.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.132
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, DUST CAN REALLY
FOUL UP FRAGILE EQUIPMENT LIKE THIS.

07:03.133 --> 07:05.505
SO, UH, I SHOULD HAVE US
UP AND RUNNING VERY SOON.

07:05.506 --> 07:07.346
THAT IS ONE THING I'M SURE OF.

07:07.347 --> 07:08.508
BECAUSE OF WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE.

07:08.509 --> 07:10.389
I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

07:10.390 --> 07:13.052
YOU KNOW, A MAN IS NOTHING WITHOUT
A GOOD WOMAN RIGHT BY HIS SIDE.

07:13.053 --> 07:15.725
OH, AND THAT'S WHERE I AM.
RIGHT HERE BY YOUR SIDE.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.898
- (doorbell rings)
- GOTTA GO!

07:23.614 --> 07:27.827
YOU CALLED. WE HEARD. YOUR PROBLEM
WILL BE CURED. I'M A JIFFY NERD.

07:27.828 --> 07:30.329
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU
FOR COMING AROUND THE BACK.

07:30.330 --> 07:32.703
NO PROB. (grunts)

07:34.835 --> 07:36.786
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A VIDEO
CALL AND IT'S NOT WORKING

07:36.787 --> 07:38.788
AND MY HUSBAND THINKS
HE CAN FIX IT HIMSELF.

07:38.789 --> 07:41.420
OH, WE GET THAT ALL THE TIME.
IN FACT, MOST OF OUR BUSINESS

07:41.421 --> 07:43.543
IS HUSBANDS FIXING THINGS.

07:43.544 --> 07:45.845
HAS IT BEEN THROWN AGAINST
A WALL IN FRUSTRATION YET?

07:45.846 --> 07:47.967
MY HUSBAND OR THE COMPUTER?

07:47.968 --> 07:50.009
THEY'RE BOTH FINE. FOR NOW.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.971
- UH, WHERE'S THE COMPUTER?
- IN THE LIVING ROOM.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.803
- OKAY. -WHOA! WHERE DO
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

07:53.804 --> 07:57.016
I FIND IT HELPS IF I'M IN THE
SAME ROOM AS THE MACHINE.

07:57.017 --> 07:59.188
I JUST WANT TO VIDEO
CHAT WITH MY NEPHEW.

07:59.189 --> 08:00.810
TODAY IS HIS
EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY.

08:00.811 --> 08:02.522
AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER 23 MINUTES.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.734
AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK
TO HIM ON HIS ACTUAL BIRTHDAY.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.866
THANK YOU!

08:06.867 --> 08:09.278
WE HAD A CONNECTION FOR A SECOND,
BUT THEN THE SCREEN FROZE.

08:09.279 --> 08:11.662
- WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?
- LIKE THIS.

08:13.283 --> 08:15.575
NO, I MEAN WAS THE
IMAGE PIXILATED?

08:15.576 --> 08:17.997
WAS IT JUST BLACK? I SHOULD
REALLY SEE WHAT'S ON THE DISPLAY.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.879
NO PROBLEM. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.461
MA'AM? IT'S COLD OUT HERE.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.924
WHAT? YOU MUST BE ANEMIC,
IT'S LIKE A SAUNA OUT HERE.

08:24.925 --> 08:27.047
JUST WARM YOURSELF ON
THE DRYER EXHAUST.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.803
LOOK AT YOU, FIXING A COMPUTER.
CAN I GET A PICTURE?

08:33.804 --> 08:36.015
OF ME FIXING THE COMPUTER?

08:36.016 --> 08:37.727
WELL, IN THE OLD
DAYS A MAN WOULD BE

08:37.728 --> 08:39.769
RAISING A BARN OR
KILLING A BEAR.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.902
THESE ARE THE MOMENTS
WOMEN CHERISH.

08:42.903 --> 08:44.815
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT, BABE.

08:46.857 --> 08:48.237
WHAT ARE YOU...
YOU WANNA TAKE...

08:48.238 --> 08:50.820
(camera shutter clicks)

08:50.821 --> 08:53.033
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE IN EVERY PICTURE YOU TAKE.

08:54.494 --> 08:55.956
HONEY.

08:57.998 --> 09:00.750
- (door slams) -HERE YOU
GO, EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

09:00.751 --> 09:03.292
- FIX IT.
- IT'S A PHOTO OF YOU.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.926
- THERE'S A COMPUTER THERE, TOO.
- I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THIS.

09:06.927 --> 09:09.929
SHOULD I EVEN ASK IF I CAN
SCAN THE COMPUTER FOR VIRUSES?

09:09.930 --> 09:14.724
(sighs) PRESS CONTROL, F7 AND THAT
WILL RUN THE BUILT-IN ANTIVIRUS SCAN.

09:14.725 --> 09:16.556
I'M ALL OVER IT.

09:18.729 --> 09:21.560
MEL, CHECK IT OUT. I
HARD-WIRED THE ROUTER.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.182
SO WE SHOULD HAVE
A PERFECT SIGNAL.

09:23.183 --> 09:25.775
- YOU FIXED IT? -WELL, YEAH.
BUT I'LL KNOW FOR SURE

09:25.776 --> 09:27.947
AS SOON AS I'M DONE
REINSTALLING VIDEO CHAT.

09:27.948 --> 09:30.690
OH. OKAY. WELL, IN THE MEANTIME
HOW ABOUT I JUST REACH IN HERE

09:30.691 --> 09:35.865
- AND PRESS CONTROL, F7.
- WAIT, WAIT! CONTROL, F7?

09:35.866 --> 09:38.077
WHAT ARE YOU INSINUATING?
THAT MY COMPUTER HAS A VIRUS?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.620
OF COURSE NOT!

09:40.621 --> 09:43.082
I KEEP MY COMPUTER CLEAN, MEL.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.965
I GOTTA TELL YOU
SOMETHING, I'M SHOCKED,

09:45.966 --> 09:47.506
AND A LITTLE HURT.

09:47.507 --> 09:49.920
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.633
BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK OFF!
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.095
YOU EITHER TRUST ME ON THIS OR
YOU DON'T TRUST ME ON THIS.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.768
WELL, IF THOSE ARE MY
ONLY TWO OPTIONS, THEN...

09:58.769 --> 10:01.061
I TRUST YOU. (laughs)

10:06.106 --> 10:09.568
I WAS HOPING THE MEMORY
OF HEAT WOULD WARM ME.

10:09.569 --> 10:11.991
HE WOULDN'T LET ME TOUCH THE COMPUTER.
WHAT DO YOU USUALLY DO NEXT?

10:11.992 --> 10:13.033
COME INSIDE.

10:17.497 --> 10:20.409
- HEY, DANI.
- Dani: HM?

10:20.410 --> 10:22.371
YOU KNOW, UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG,

10:22.372 --> 10:24.043
THE CLOSEST I GOT TO
HAVING A LITTLE SISTER

10:24.044 --> 10:26.956
WAS WHEN RYDER WENT
THROUGH HIS BRONY PHASE.

10:26.957 --> 10:29.588
SO I WANTED TO SAY THAT I
THINK IT'S PRETTY COOL

10:29.589 --> 10:32.802
THAT YOU CAME TO ME FOR SOME "BIG
SISTER TO LITTLE SISTER" ADVICE.

10:32.803 --> 10:34.423
YEMM...

10:34.424 --> 10:36.635
AND I THINK IT WAS
PRETTY GOOD ADVICE.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.217
YOU KNOW, ABOUT NOT
TEXTING THAT BOY.

10:38.218 --> 10:39.598
MM-HM.

10:39.599 --> 10:40.930
WAIT, ARE YOU TEXTING THAT BOY?

10:40.931 --> 10:42.351
- I SAID NO DOUBLE TEXTING!
- NO!

10:42.352 --> 10:43.602
- NO, GIVE ME THE PHONE!
- NO!

10:43.603 --> 10:44.974
- LET...
- LADIES!

10:44.975 --> 10:45.816
TAKE YOUR PILLOW FIGHT UPSTAIRS!

10:45.817 --> 10:47.146
I HAVE A TICKING CLOCK HERE!

10:47.147 --> 10:49.318
- GET...
- OH!

10:49.319 --> 10:52.271
(gasps) "JOSHNIBBLING."
I KNEW IT!

10:52.272 --> 10:55.905
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M KEEPING THIS UNTIL
YOUR CRAZY TEXTING URGE PASSES.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.576
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:57.577 --> 11:00.119
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER
I DIDN'T EVEN HIT "SEND."

11:00.120 --> 11:02.411
SO CAN I PLEASE
HAVE MY PHONE BACK?

11:02.412 --> 11:06.455
I SWEAR TO YOU I
WILL NOT TEXT HIM.

11:06.456 --> 11:10.050
LITTLE SISTER TO BIG SISTER?

11:11.842 --> 11:15.134
OH, "LITTLE SISTER TO BIG
SISTER." I LIKE THAT.

11:15.135 --> 11:16.635
YOUR SOCIAL LIFE WILL THANK ME.

11:16.636 --> 11:19.008
AND "SEND."

11:19.009 --> 11:21.430
YOU SWORE!

11:21.431 --> 11:23.182
HOW ELSE WAS I SUPPOSED
TO GET MY PHONE BACK?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.014
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:25.015 --> 11:26.806
THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT
TO ASK ME FOR ADVICE,

11:26.807 --> 11:30.810
HERE'S SOME ADVICE. DON'T.

11:30.811 --> 11:33.612
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID, HONEST.

11:33.613 --> 11:35.945
I JUST DON'T THINK IT APPLIES
TO KIDS FROM MY GENERATION.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.778
IT'S FINE FOR OLDER
FOLKS LIKE YOU.

11:40.370 --> 11:41.620
I'M 20!

11:41.621 --> 11:43.914
UH, YEAH?

11:45.996 --> 11:48.667
(groans) I'VE NEVER
BEEN CALLED OLD BEFORE.

11:48.668 --> 11:51.670
OH, NOW I KNOW HOW
AUNT MEL FEELS.

11:51.671 --> 11:55.634
- (phone chimes)
- IT'S JOSH!

11:55.635 --> 11:57.927
"SORRY, I MEANT TO GET
BACK TO YOU SOONER.

11:57.928 --> 12:01.470
THANKS FOR REMINDING ME.
SEE YOU AT THE PARTY."

12:01.471 --> 12:04.053
LENNOX, YOUR ADVICE WAS USEFUL.

12:04.054 --> 12:06.685
SOMETIMES A PERSON NEEDS
TO HEAR THE WRONG THING

12:06.686 --> 12:08.849
IN ORDER TO KNOW
THE RIGHT THING.

12:11.061 --> 12:14.274
YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
OLDER SISTERS ARE FOR.

12:16.656 --> 12:19.158
- (computer beeps)
- YES! YEP! I'M A HERO!

12:19.159 --> 12:21.070
DANI, GET OVER HERE!
LOOK AT THIS!

12:21.071 --> 12:23.122
I REINSTALLED THE O.S., UPDATED
THE VIDEO CHAT SOFTWARE,

12:23.123 --> 12:24.864
AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THE WIFI ANYMORE

12:24.865 --> 12:28.788
BECAUSE I JUST HARD-WIRED THE
COMPUTER TO THE ROUTER. HUH? AWESOME.

12:28.789 --> 12:32.711
- OH, BOY! CAN I GO NOW?
- YES. YES, YOU CAN, HONEY.

12:32.712 --> 12:34.874
TO THE KITCHEN. ALL RIGHT? GO TELL
MEL AND LENNOX WE ARE SECONDS AWAY

12:34.875 --> 12:38.138
FROM CONNECTING WITH RYDER AND WISHING HIM
A GLITCH-FREE VIRTUAL HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

12:39.139 --> 12:42.301
OH! NO! OH!

12:42.302 --> 12:46.385
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY! CURSE
THESE WILD COLTISH LEGS!

12:46.386 --> 12:48.387
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD!

12:48.388 --> 12:51.691
MAD, ME? (chuckles)

12:52.983 --> 12:55.234
SINCE I'M SORT OF
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS...

12:55.235 --> 12:58.948
YOU KNOW, HONEY, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
USING "SORT OF" THE RIGHT WAY.

12:58.949 --> 13:02.361
I CAN MAKE IT RIGHT. COME ON.

13:02.362 --> 13:04.113
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- UPSTAIRS.

13:04.114 --> 13:06.826
- WHAT'S UPSTAIRS?
- NEIGHBOR'S WIFI.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.748
THE NEIGH... WHAT?

13:09.910 --> 13:11.080
OKAY, ALL WE NEED TO DO

13:11.081 --> 13:13.372
IS MAKE A PERISCOPE OUT OF
PAPER TOWEL ROLLS AND MIRRORS.

13:13.373 --> 13:15.464
THEN YOU CAN PEEK AT MY HUSBAND'S
COMPUTER THROUGH THE WINDOW.

13:15.465 --> 13:17.256
COME ON, YOU'RE A
NERD, IT'LL BE EASY.

13:17.257 --> 13:19.678
I NEED TO BE AT THE
COMPUTER, TOUCHING IT.

13:19.679 --> 13:22.842
- CAN'T I GO INSIDE? -NO, NO, NO! MY
HUSBAND DOESN'T KNOW I CALLED YOU.

13:22.843 --> 13:26.135
CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING WITHOUT
HAVING THE ACTUAL COMPUTER?

13:26.136 --> 13:29.018
WELL, I GUESS I COULD CHECK IF
THE TROUBLE IS ON THE OTHER END.

13:29.019 --> 13:32.351
YES! ON THE OTHER END! NOW
YOU'RE THINKING LIKE A NERD!

13:32.352 --> 13:35.024
(blows)

13:35.025 --> 13:37.606
OH! WELL, HERE YOU GO.
HERE'S YOUR TROUBLE.

13:37.607 --> 13:39.738
YOU HAVE NO WIFI SIGNAL.

13:39.739 --> 13:42.992
I'LL GET MY HOTSPOT OUT OF THE JIFFYMOBILE.
BE RIGHT BACK.

13:42.993 --> 13:44.323
GO, 14 MINUTES!

13:44.324 --> 13:46.406
RUN, YOU GLORIOUS NERD, RUN!

13:54.004 --> 13:58.127
YES! FOUR BARS. THANK YOU, MR.
AND MRS. BUCHWALD.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.050
I'LL JUST ENTER THEIR PASSWORD.

14:01.051 --> 14:02.221
(computer chimes)

14:02.222 --> 14:03.552
WHAT?! THEY CHANGED IT!

14:03.553 --> 14:06.305
DOESN'T ANYONE TRUST
THEIR NEIGHBORS ANYMORE?

14:06.306 --> 14:10.429
- WHAT WAS THE OLD PASSWORD?
- THEIR CAT'S NAME: MR. CUTIE PIE.

14:10.430 --> 14:11.811
YOU KNOW, I HATE THAT CAT.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.023
HEY, THEY HAVE KIDS.

14:14.024 --> 14:15.644
- WHAT ABOUT THEIR NAMES?
- OH, OKAY.

14:15.645 --> 14:17.066
UH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. UM...

14:17.067 --> 14:19.899
THE, UH... CHUBBY ONE.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.440
UH, "FOOD IN THE HAIR."

14:21.441 --> 14:24.613
AND, UH, "THE ONE WHO'S ALWAYS
GOT HIS HANDS IN HIS PANTS."

14:24.614 --> 14:26.986
IS THAT ALL CAPS
OR ALL LOWERCASE?

14:26.987 --> 14:28.788
I'M DOING MY BEST HERE!

14:30.660 --> 14:32.041
GETTING A CONNECTION
WITH YOUR NEPHEW.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.252
OKAY. REMEMBER, THIS
IS JUST A TEST.

14:33.253 --> 14:34.833
NO BIRTHDAY STUFF, NO SINGING.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.795
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT? RYDER
SHOULDN'T SEE ME AT ALL.

14:36.796 --> 14:38.918
HE'LL FEEL BAD IF IT'S
NOT ALL OF US TOGETHER.

14:38.919 --> 14:39.919
Ryder: Hey, it's Ryder.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.001
Do I know you?

14:42.002 --> 14:44.383
JIFFY NERD. JUST TESTING
THE CONNECTION.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.967
- Yeah. -HEY, WEREN'T YOU THE GAME
MASTER AT THAT LASER TAG PLACE?

14:47.968 --> 14:50.639
HEY, YEAH, I KNOW YOU. YOU WERE
THE GUY THAT USED TO COME IN

14:50.640 --> 14:52.561
ALL THE TIME WITH
THE REALLY HOT MOM.

14:52.562 --> 14:54.813
- YEAH, MAN! GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- Dani: AUNT MEL!

14:54.814 --> 14:56.895
I'VE OUTLIVED MY USEFULNESS.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.227
OH, YOU POOR THING.

14:58.228 --> 15:00.070
TELL ME EVERYTHING.
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

15:01.611 --> 15:03.732
OKAY. I'M ALL EARS.

15:03.733 --> 15:05.824
TALK. QUICKLY.

15:05.825 --> 15:08.287
OKAY, WELL, I THOUGHT I WAS
BEING A BIG SISTER TO DANI

15:08.288 --> 15:10.789
BY GIVING HER WHAT I HUMBLY
WOULD CONSIDER GREAT ADVICE,

15:10.790 --> 15:13.202
BUT THEN SHE JUST GOES
AND DOES THE OPPOSITE.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.624
OH, SWEETIE. QUICKER.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.296
WELL, SHE CONSIDERS ME A RELIC.

15:17.297 --> 15:20.170
YOU KNOW, AT 20 YEARS OLD I
HAVE NOTHING MORE TO OFFER.

15:21.631 --> 15:23.132
OH, I'M LIKE ONE OF
THOSE OLD LADIES

15:23.133 --> 15:25.214
THAT USED TO COME TO OUR
SCHOOL AND TALK ABOUT SMOKING.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.846
OH, THERE, THERE.

15:27.847 --> 15:31.390
- BETTER? -SERIOUSLY? THAT'S ALL I GET?
"THERE, THERE"?

15:31.391 --> 15:33.812
SOMETIMES THAT'S ENOUGH. OKAY?

15:33.813 --> 15:36.725
NOW I THINK YOU SHOULD GO TO
YOUR ROOM AND THINK ABOUT THIS.

15:36.726 --> 15:38.267
YEAH, "THERE, THERE." OH!

15:38.268 --> 15:40.609
YOU'LL SEE. IT'S LIKE
A TIME-RELEASE THING.

15:40.610 --> 15:41.901
OKAY? GO.

15:43.984 --> 15:47.276
WHY WOULD YOU GIVE UP A JOB WHERE YOU
CAN PLAY ENDLESS FREE LASER TAG?

15:47.277 --> 15:49.198
I wanted to do
something meaningful.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.911
I volunteered for AmeriCorps.

15:52.912 --> 15:54.743
No, seriously, I just
followed a hot girl.

15:54.744 --> 15:57.956
HEY, I'M NOT PAYING YOU A HUNDRED
DOLLARS TO GAB! HANG UP!

15:57.957 --> 16:00.169
UH, GOTTA GO, DUDE.
GREAT CATCHING UP.

16:00.170 --> 16:03.582
Later. Thanks for calling me on my
birthday. You were the only one.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.844
OKAY, IT'S NOT YOUR WIFI.

16:05.845 --> 16:07.426
SO THEN THAT MEANS...

16:07.427 --> 16:09.468
IT MEANS, I SWEAR, IF
YOU JUST LET ME HOLD

16:09.469 --> 16:11.930
THE BROKEN COMPUTER, I CAN
FIX IT IN FIVE MINUTES.

16:11.931 --> 16:14.643
OKAY. I JUST HAVE TO
DISTRACT MY HUSBAND.

16:14.644 --> 16:17.476
UM... OOH, I'LL JUST TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS
FOR A QUICKIE. OKAY WITH YOU?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.149
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE GROSSING ME
OUT, BUT ANYTHING TO GET INSIDE.

16:20.150 --> 16:22.861
OKAY, COME ON.

16:22.862 --> 16:24.363
OKAY, SO MR. BUCHWALD
IS A SPORTS NUT,

16:24.364 --> 16:26.985
SO IF IT'S NOT "GO
BENGALS" OR "GO INDIANS,"

16:26.986 --> 16:28.867
THEN IT'S GOTTA BE, UM...

16:28.868 --> 16:30.819
OOH! "GO CAVALIERS."

16:30.820 --> 16:32.071
- (computer chimes)
- WE'RE IN!

16:32.072 --> 16:35.574
- WAS I RIGHT? -OH, I WASN'T LISTENING.
I HAD MY OWN IDEA.

16:35.575 --> 16:38.497
(laughs) GUESS WHAT THE
BUCHWALD'S WIFI PASSWORD IS.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.541
- WHAT?
- "BUCHWALDWIFI."

16:43.923 --> 16:45.964
SO, DAUGHTER, WE DID IT!

16:45.965 --> 16:48.257
ACTUALLY, I DID IT.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.469
YOU KNOW, HONEY, JUST A
LITTLE LIFE LESSON HERE:

16:50.470 --> 16:53.092
WHEN YOU HAVE A VICTORY, IT'S
NICE TO SPREAD THE JOY AROUND.

16:53.093 --> 16:54.843
ESPECIALLY WITH THE PERSON
WHO PAYS YOUR ALLOWANCE.

16:54.844 --> 16:57.806
- GOT IT.
- GOT IT. OKAY.

16:57.807 --> 17:00.018
AND WITH FIVE MINUTES TO SPARE,
I'M GONNA GO TELL MEL AND LENNOX

17:00.019 --> 17:02.901
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
THAT BIRTHDAY CALL.

17:02.902 --> 17:06.024
OKAY, LOOK, WHILE I AM UPSTAIRS
WORKING MY MAGIC ON MY HUSBAND,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.107
YOU NEED TO BE DOWNSTAIRS WORKING
YOUR MAGIC ON THE COMPUTER.

17:08.108 --> 17:10.239
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT THE
SAME KIND OF MAGIC.

17:10.240 --> 17:14.073
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER IF YOU JUST
USED MY COMPUTER TO MAKE THE CALL?

17:14.074 --> 17:15.455
MY HUSBAND CANNOT
KNOW YOU'RE HERE!

17:16.866 --> 17:18.497
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

17:18.498 --> 17:20.539
UH... JOE,

17:20.540 --> 17:24.253
I... I CAN'T KEEP THIS
A SECRET ANY LONGER!

17:24.254 --> 17:25.795
THIS IS MY LOVER!

17:28.798 --> 17:32.381
YOUR LOVER, HUH? WHO CONVENIENTLY
JUST HAPPENS TO FIX COMPUTERS?

17:32.382 --> 17:36.095
WELL, UH, I GOT SICK OF THE MUSCLE-Y,
HUNKY TYPE, AND DECIDED TO CHANGE IT UP.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.978
- YOU KNOW, TRY ME SOME SCRAWNY.
- HEY!

17:40.230 --> 17:43.852
FINE, I CALLED A JIFFY NERD.

17:43.853 --> 17:45.604
FLASH, JOE. JOE, FLASH.

17:45.605 --> 17:48.357
I'VE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF
THIS ARGUMENT TOO MANY TIMES.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.819
MY THERAPIST SAYS IT'S
WHY I CAN NEVER LOVE.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.992
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

17:53.993 --> 17:55.995
YOUR BILL IS IN YOUR INBOX.

17:57.247 --> 17:58.957
I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA
FIX THE INTERNET,

17:58.958 --> 18:01.910
AND I FIXED THE INTERNET. WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE HONESTY HERE?

18:01.911 --> 18:04.703
THERE'S NO TIME FOR HONESTY. WE ONLY HAVE
FOUR MINUTES TILL WE HAVE TO CALL RYDER.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.585
SO IT'S OKAY TO LIE BEHIND
MY BACK AS LONG AS RYDER

18:06.586 --> 18:08.006
GETS HIS BIRTHDAY
CALL BEFORE MIDNIGHT?

18:08.007 --> 18:09.798
SEE? I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

18:09.799 --> 18:13.011
HEY, ARE WE CALLING
RYDER OR NOT?

18:13.012 --> 18:15.013
NO, I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE SINGING.
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

18:15.014 --> 18:17.015
WHAT? NO! WE ALL HAVE TO
SING OR IT DOESN'T COUNT!

18:17.016 --> 18:19.808
MEL, WHY... WHY IS THIS
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

18:19.809 --> 18:22.561
DO YOU WANT RYDER TO BE
HURT AND UPSET ABOUT THIS

18:22.562 --> 18:26.185
FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME,
UNTIL HE'S A GROWN WOMAN?

18:26.186 --> 18:28.397
OKAY, I THINK WE'RE ONTO SOMETHING HERE.
NOBODY MOVE.

18:28.398 --> 18:32.861
MY WHOLE LIFE MY FATHER WAS
NEVER THERE FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.324
YOU KNOW, IT JUST FELT LIKE THAT
DAY JUST WASN'T IMPORTANT TO HIM.

18:35.325 --> 18:39.448
BUT FOR MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY
HE SWORE HE WOULD BE THERE.

18:39.449 --> 18:42.581
SO WE HAD A BIG PARTY,
AND HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

18:42.582 --> 18:45.794
AND I WAS STANDING THERE IN
A ROOM FULL OF MY FRIENDS

18:45.795 --> 18:48.046
IN MY BEAUTIFUL PINK
STRAPLESS DRESS

18:48.047 --> 18:51.009
WITH TEARS AND MASCARA
STREAMING DOWN MY FACE,

18:51.010 --> 18:53.802
AND I JUST DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN TO RYDER!

18:53.803 --> 18:57.136
BELIEVE ME, I DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN RYDER EITHER.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.930
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE SINGING
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE BOY.

19:01.931 --> 19:04.644
TO THE NEIGHBORS' WIFI! COME ON.

19:05.935 --> 19:07.065
IT'S TWO MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT!

19:07.066 --> 19:08.647
- DIAL IT!

20:08.498 --> 20:10.709
Hold on, I'm about to go
to a midnight screening.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.252
So can you guys just, like,
email it to me or something?

20:13.253 --> 20:15.424
NO, NO, NO! THIS IS
VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU!

20:15.425 --> 20:18.258
Call me tomorrow.
Just not early.

20:22.181 --> 20:24.973
- WELL, THAT WAS UNDERWHELMING.
- YEAH.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.766
WELL, EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T GET
TO SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO RYDER,

20:27.767 --> 20:31.771
I... I STILL THINK WE CAN TAKE AWAY SOMETHING
KIND OF COOL FROM THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE.

20:33.022 --> 20:35.524
THAT WAS AN AMAZING
INTERNET CONNECTION.

20:35.525 --> 20:39.908
DID YOU SEE HOW CLEAR THAT WAS? COME ON!
HUH? THAT WAS ALL ME.

20:39.909 --> 20:42.070
- ALL YOU?
- ISN'T YOUR ALLOWANCE COMING UP?

20:42.071 --> 20:44.324
- NO, IT WAS ALL YOU.
- HM...

20:46.786 --> 20:50.959
SO YOUR DAD MISSED YOUR SIXTEENTH
BIRTHDAY AND HE NEVER MADE IT UP TO YOU?

20:50.960 --> 20:53.251
- NOT EVEN A WORD OF APOLOGY?
- NOT A PEEP.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.463
HARSH.

20:54.464 --> 20:55.874
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
I MEAN, HE TRIED

20:55.875 --> 20:57.676
TO MAKE IT UP TO ME BY
BUYING ME A WHITE RABBIT,

20:57.677 --> 20:59.718
BUT I WAS LIKE, "TOO LITTLE
TOO LATE," YOU KNOW?

20:59.719 --> 21:01.380
AWWW. I WOULD HAVE
FORGIVEN MY DAD

21:01.381 --> 21:03.011
IF HE BOUGHT ME A
CUTE LITTLE BUNNY.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.883
OH, NO, A RABBIT CONVERTIBLE.

21:04.884 --> 21:08.597
YOU KNOW, TWO DOOR. STICK SHIFT.
LEATHER SEATS. THE WORKS.

21:08.598 --> 21:10.479
HE GAVE YOU A CAR?

21:10.480 --> 21:12.691
YEAH, BUT A CAR'S NOT
THE SAME AS LOVE.

21:12.692 --> 21:15.814
YEAH! YOU CAN'T DRIVE
LOVE TO COACHELLA!

21:15.815 --> 21:17.235
JOE, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

21:17.236 --> 21:19.898
IT'S WHAT'S FROM THE
HEART THAT'S IMPORTANT.

21:19.899 --> 21:21.861
HE GAVE YOU A CAR.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.904
OH, FORGET IT!
