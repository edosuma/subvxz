00:00.919 --> 00:02.379
<i>Previously on</i> Riverdale...

00:02.587 --> 00:05.507
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

00:05.715 --> 00:08.677
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious death
of Jason Blossom</i>

00:08.885 --> 00:09.970
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

00:10.220 --> 00:11.930
- Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
- About what?

00:12.138 --> 00:13.723
<i>You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?</i>

00:15.016 --> 00:17.352
We heard what we heard,
and afterwards
we didn't do anything!

00:17.560 --> 00:21.606
How would we explain why
we were together at 6:00 a.m.
on the 4th of July?

00:21.856 --> 00:23.608
- Hello, Fred.
- Can I get you anything?

00:23.817 --> 00:25.318
- A job.
<i>- I can't very well have</i>

00:25.527 --> 00:27.070
the wife of Hiram Lodge,

00:27.278 --> 00:28.697
<i>on trial for fraud
and embezzlement,</i>

00:28.905 --> 00:29.990
<i>balancing my books.</i>

00:30.198 --> 00:31.074
Oh, Hiram...

00:31.408 --> 00:33.827
Oh, my God, it's Jason.
He was shot.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.413
What were you doing
down at the river so early
on July 4th?

00:36.621 --> 00:38.248
- Working on some songs.
<i>- Were you alone?</i>

00:38.456 --> 00:40.083
<i>I saw something
at Sweetwater River.</i>

00:40.291 --> 00:41.501
Ms. Grundy's car.

00:41.710 --> 00:42.627
By the river's edge.

00:46.673 --> 00:49.759
<i>It's been
a week since the discovery
of Jason Blossom's body.</i>

00:52.721 --> 00:54.556
<i>But his death
is not the first,</i>

00:54.764 --> 00:56.224
<i>nor would it be
the last casualty</i>

00:56.433 --> 00:58.101
<i>that the town of
Riverdale would suffer.</i>

00:58.768 --> 01:00.770
<i>The Twilight Drive-In
where I work,</i>

01:00.979 --> 01:02.605
<i>my home away from home,</i>

01:02.814 --> 01:05.442
<i>a piece of town history,
is closing for good,</i>

01:05.942 --> 01:08.403
<i>just when we needed
a place to escape to the most.</i>

01:08.987 --> 01:10.989
<i>With Sheriff Keller
knocking on every door</i>

01:11.197 --> 01:13.116
<i>and neighbor
suspecting neighbor,</i>

01:13.324 --> 01:15.577
<i>Riverdale, every day
that passes, is becoming</i>

01:15.785 --> 01:18.038
<i>more like Salem
during the witch trials.</i>

01:18.705 --> 01:20.623
<i>And meanwhile,
the girl next door,</i>

01:20.832 --> 01:24.044
<i>our friendly neighborhood
Hitchcock blonde,
Betty Cooper,</i>

01:24.294 --> 01:25.712
<i>was wrestling
with the knowledge</i>

01:25.920 --> 01:27.630
<i>that her best friend,
Archie Andrews,</i>

01:27.839 --> 01:29.966
<i>was caught up in
a forbidden romance.</i>

01:31.217 --> 01:32.260
<i>"Dear Diary,</i>

01:32.635 --> 01:34.763
<i>"Sheriff Keller doesn't
know what I know,</i>

01:34.971 --> 01:37.974
<i>"that Riverdale High's
music teacher,
Geraldine Grundy,</i>

01:38.183 --> 01:41.478
<i>"was at Sweetwater River
the morning
Jason Blossom went missing,</i>

01:41.686 --> 01:44.272
<i>"and that since Archie
was also there,</i>

01:44.481 --> 01:46.524
<i>"they could have
been there together."</i>

01:48.443 --> 01:50.153
She is incredible.

01:52.238 --> 01:53.198
She's the best.

02:04.501 --> 02:07.712
I'm usually more
of a classic rock kind of guy,

02:07.921 --> 02:09.756
but that was beautiful.

02:10.006 --> 02:11.007
Truly.

02:11.466 --> 02:13.093
Congratulations, Ms. Grundy.

02:14.344 --> 02:15.220
Thank you,

02:15.637 --> 02:16.930
both of you for coming.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.807
No, you kidding?
Archie, he wouldn't miss it.

02:19.015 --> 02:20.475
I had to beg him
to let me come.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.852
Great. I'll see you
at school, Ms. Grundy.

02:23.061 --> 02:23.770
Let's go, Dad.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.563
Well, I was thinkin' that,
you know,

02:25.772 --> 02:26.981
if you're gonna
be alone tonight,

02:27.190 --> 02:28.817
that we could take you
out to dinner.

02:30.235 --> 02:31.402
Oh. No, I...

02:32.320 --> 02:33.446
No, I couldn't impose.

02:33.655 --> 02:36.282
After everything
you've done for my son, I...

02:36.866 --> 02:38.076
You know, with his music,

02:38.284 --> 02:39.869
it's the least
I can do. I insist.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.793
The Drive-In closing

02:46.960 --> 02:49.546
is just one more
nail in the coffin
that is Riverdale...

02:49.754 --> 02:50.880
No, forget Riverdale,

02:51.089 --> 02:52.674
in the coffin of
the American dream.

02:52.882 --> 02:54.509
As the godfather of
indie cinema,

02:54.717 --> 02:56.010
Quentin Tarantino,
likes to say...

02:56.219 --> 02:57.387
Please, God,

02:57.595 --> 02:59.139
no more
Quentin Tarantino references.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.016
What? I'm pissed.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.561
And not just
about losing my job.

03:04.769 --> 03:07.105
The Twilight Drive-In
should mean
something to us.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.023
People should be
trying to save it.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.193
In this age of Netflix
and VOD,

03:12.402 --> 03:15.029
do people
really want to watch
a movie in a car?

03:15.196 --> 03:17.073
I mean, who even goes there?

03:17.282 --> 03:18.449
People who
want to buy crack.

03:18.658 --> 03:20.201
And cinephiles,

03:20.410 --> 03:21.661
and car enthusiasts.

03:21.870 --> 03:22.829
Right, Bets?

03:24.330 --> 03:25.290
Totally.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.250
Anyway, it's closing

03:27.458 --> 03:28.501
because the town owns it,

03:28.710 --> 03:30.378
but didn't invest in it.

03:30.587 --> 03:31.963
So when an anonymous buyer

03:32.172 --> 03:34.048
made Mayor McCoy an offer,
she couldn't refuse...

03:34.257 --> 03:35.842
Anonymous buyer?

03:36.050 --> 03:37.677
What do they
have to hide?
No one cares.

03:37.886 --> 03:38.636
I do!

03:40.013 --> 03:41.848
Also, you guys should
all come to closing night.

03:42.056 --> 03:42.974
I'm thinking

03:43.183 --> 03:44.184
<i>American Graffiti...</i>

03:45.351 --> 03:46.644
Or is that
too obvious?

03:46.853 --> 03:48.855
I vote for anything
starring Audrey Hepburn.

03:49.063 --> 03:49.898
Or Cate Blanchett.

03:50.106 --> 03:52.192
Or <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley.</i>

03:53.067 --> 03:54.360
Betty, your choices?

03:56.738 --> 03:57.739
Everything okay, B?

03:57.947 --> 04:00.909
Yeah, I'm just thinking. Um...

04:01.117 --> 04:03.870
Maybe
<i>Rebel Without a Cause?</i>

04:06.915 --> 04:07.832
Here you go, kids.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.335
Thanks, Mom.

04:11.127 --> 04:12.212
If I would have known
Mama Lodge was working

04:12.420 --> 04:13.588
as a waitress at Pop's,

04:13.796 --> 04:16.049
I never would have
given Veronica
a spot on the Vixens.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.593
It's off-brand,
and sends a false message
about acceptance.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.428
After her TMZ-style
take-down of Chuck,

04:20.637 --> 04:22.180
all the Vixens kind of
like Veronica now.

04:22.388 --> 04:23.306
Do they?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.602
Be sure to put
all that cash
in the register.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.604
You are a Lodge, after all,

04:30.104 --> 04:32.273
and Lodges are known
to have sticky fingers.

04:32.690 --> 04:34.943
- Cheryl...
- Honey, I got this.

04:35.151 --> 04:36.861
Cheryl, I went to school
with your mother.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.571
She didn't know the difference
between having money

04:38.738 --> 04:40.114
and having class, either.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.250
Now, that's an odd
combo of people.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.631
- I'll be right back.
- No, Betty.

04:56.839 --> 04:57.799
No. Don't...

04:58.007 --> 04:59.259
Wait, what's happening?

05:04.180 --> 05:04.931
Hey, Betty.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.432
Hi, Mr. Andrews,

05:06.641 --> 05:07.642
Ms. Grundy.

05:07.850 --> 05:08.977
Archie, can I talk to you?

05:09.185 --> 05:10.395
Sure. I'll call you later?

05:10.603 --> 05:11.688
No. Actually, now.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.606
Just school stuff. Outside?

05:21.030 --> 05:22.824
Archie, as your best friend,

05:23.032 --> 05:25.118
is there anything
you want to tell me?

05:26.202 --> 05:27.120
I don't think so.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.541
Ms. Grundy was at
Sweetwater River on July 4th.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.545
Were you with her?

05:37.922 --> 05:38.881
Did Jughead tell you?

05:40.008 --> 05:41.676
Jughead knows about this?

05:42.927 --> 05:44.637
What's happening out there?
Do we know? Is it about me?

05:45.513 --> 05:47.015
I have a strong inkling,

05:47.223 --> 05:48.474
and no.

05:48.683 --> 05:50.018
Also, I'd let it go.

05:50.226 --> 05:52.186
Yes, but you're you,
and I'm me.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.272
You do you, girl,
I'll be back.

05:57.442 --> 05:58.985
What was it like
before she got here?

06:01.029 --> 06:02.947
I honestly cannot remember.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.490
It's not what you're thinking.

06:04.699 --> 06:05.658
So, it's platonic?

06:07.118 --> 06:08.369
Okay, well, maybe
it's a little like

06:08.578 --> 06:09.620
- what you're thinking...
- Archie.

06:09.829 --> 06:12.915
Are you and Ms. Grundy,
like, together,

06:13.124 --> 06:14.375
like, romantically?

06:14.584 --> 06:15.668
Oh, my God.

06:15.877 --> 06:17.003
You and your music teacher

06:17.211 --> 06:18.046
are having an affair?

06:18.254 --> 06:19.422
We are...

06:20.673 --> 06:22.508
...together. Look,
I know that sounds bad, but...

06:22.717 --> 06:23.718
Bad?

06:23.926 --> 06:25.345
It sounds scandalous.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.513
It sounds like
jail time to me. Illegal!

06:27.722 --> 06:29.098
- Betty, don't go there.
- Oh, I'm already there.

06:29.307 --> 06:30.350
Ronnie, a little help here?

06:30.558 --> 06:31.392
I mean,

06:31.601 --> 06:33.102
technically, Betty's right.

06:33.311 --> 06:34.896
And ethically...

06:35.104 --> 06:37.315
Well, what is Grundy
to you, anyway,

06:37.523 --> 06:38.941
your girlfriend?

06:39.150 --> 06:40.610
Your booty tutor?

06:40.818 --> 06:42.070
I don't know,
I don't know
what to call her.

06:42.278 --> 06:44.447
You said you were
at the river alone.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.199
You lied to Sheriff Keller,

06:46.407 --> 06:47.408
to all of us.

06:47.617 --> 06:49.035
Why? To protect her?

06:49.243 --> 06:50.828
She believed in me
when no one else did.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.914
Okay, we get it.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.333
Betty, say something, please.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.384
Get in the car, Betty. Now.

07:13.810 --> 07:16.521
- What have I told you
about those two?
- Can we just go?

07:25.780 --> 07:26.906
Oh, Archiekins...

07:27.615 --> 07:28.991
You're in it deep this time.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.011
Turn down the music.

07:50.972 --> 07:52.849
I spy with my little eye

07:53.057 --> 07:54.684
Hermione Lodge,
full of secrets.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.354
Riddle me this,
hair models
of the damned,

07:58.729 --> 08:00.982
why is Veronica's mother
having a clandestine
tete-a-tete

08:01.190 --> 08:02.442
with a Southside Serpent

08:02.650 --> 08:04.110
behind a dumpster at Pop's?

08:06.863 --> 08:08.114
Yeah, so we agree.

08:21.794 --> 08:24.505
How hard would it
have been to give me
a little heads-up?

08:24.714 --> 08:26.424
Look, I am, by nature,

08:26.632 --> 08:28.259
a conscientious objector.

08:28.468 --> 08:30.386
Not saying anything
to either you or Betty,

08:30.595 --> 08:32.889
was the most moral, apathetic
choice I could make.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.223
But, Jug.

08:34.432 --> 08:35.600
She's not going to write
about me and Grundy

08:35.808 --> 08:36.642
in the paper, is she?

08:36.851 --> 08:38.144
Like she did with Chuck?

08:38.978 --> 08:40.480
Dude, seriously?

08:41.481 --> 08:42.607
Okay. Come on.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.275
Think about
what you're asking.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.778
If there was even
an iota of a chance

08:47.987 --> 08:50.031
that something could
hurt you in any way,

08:50.239 --> 08:51.407
Betty wouldn't do it.

08:52.617 --> 08:53.951
- Probably.
- Oh, my God.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.330
I'm kidding.
But maybe she has a point.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.456
What do you see happening

08:58.664 --> 08:59.999
with Grundy, long-term?

09:01.209 --> 09:02.376
What do you want?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.713
I want
to be with her.

09:06.506 --> 09:07.965
I don't know how,
but I wanna hang on to

09:08.174 --> 09:09.717
what we have for
as long as possible.

09:09.926 --> 09:12.011
Yup. I feel that.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.472
Trying to hold on
to something a lot
older than me, too.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.724
Just... If Betty's gonna
do anything crazy,

09:16.933 --> 09:19.143
can you please
let me know so I can
do something to stop it?

09:19.352 --> 09:21.020
Thank you for taking
the time, Ms. Grundy.

09:21.229 --> 09:22.188
Like I said,
the <i>Blue and Gold</i>

09:22.396 --> 09:24.315
is doing
a series of articles
spotlighting teachers,

09:24.524 --> 09:25.650
and you're our first.

09:26.609 --> 09:27.527
Let's begin.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.779
Uh, you joined
the faculty last year.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.489
Where did you move
to Riverdale from?

09:31.697 --> 09:33.032
Um, here and there. I was

09:33.241 --> 09:34.408
just mostly on the road.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.453
- But you've taught at other
schools, I'm assuming?
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

09:37.662 --> 09:38.579
- Yeah.
- Right.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.414
Um...

09:40.623 --> 09:42.124
Can I get their names?

09:43.918 --> 09:45.002
Seaside High,

09:45.211 --> 09:46.671
Centreville High.

09:46.879 --> 09:47.755
What made you leave?

09:47.964 --> 09:49.131
They were temporary
placements.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.385
Just filling in for
maternity, sabbatical,
things like that.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.221
This is my first
permanent position.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.514
Getting back to music,

09:56.722 --> 09:57.765
you're working
with Archie Andrews

09:57.974 --> 09:59.058
on an independent study.

09:59.267 --> 10:02.061
Have you ever done
this sort of thing before?

10:02.270 --> 10:04.146
- Yes. Last year.
- Oh.

10:04.355 --> 10:05.481
With Tomoko Yoshido

10:06.524 --> 10:07.817
and Jason Blossom.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.071
Jason?

10:12.280 --> 10:14.657
- Before...
- Such a tragedy.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.326
He was an inspiration.

10:17.827 --> 10:19.662
And pretty cute, right?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.542
I don't think of
my students that way.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.544
- No, no, no, no...
- And I'm sorry,

10:26.752 --> 10:27.670
I really should

10:27.878 --> 10:29.714
prepare for
my next class.

10:34.302 --> 10:36.304
It's this quintessential
rite of passage,

10:36.512 --> 10:38.556
making out with your boy
or girlfriend at the movies.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.308
Why don't we go together?

10:40.516 --> 10:42.184
I can't promise you
any action,

10:42.393 --> 10:44.353
but maybe I'll bring you
good luck.

10:44.562 --> 10:45.771
Great. Another night,

10:45.980 --> 10:47.148
another hag.

10:47.315 --> 10:49.275
Speaking of hags...

10:49.483 --> 10:50.401
Veronica,

10:50.610 --> 10:51.736
it's so devastating to me

10:51.944 --> 10:52.820
that your mother
has to sink to such

10:53.029 --> 10:53.946
unspeakable lows

10:54.155 --> 10:56.616
just to keep those knockoff
Hermes bags on your arm.

10:57.408 --> 10:59.577
What's next, selling
her hair extensions?

10:59.785 --> 11:02.830
My mom's a waitress,
Cheryl, not Fantine.

11:03.039 --> 11:05.458
And your faux concern
reeks of ulterior motive.
What is it?

11:05.875 --> 11:08.127
Only to remind you
of your place in this school,

11:08.336 --> 11:10.212
nay, the town's
social hierarchy.

11:10.671 --> 11:11.672
Threatened much?

11:12.173 --> 11:13.924
Don't worry.
You may be a stock character

11:14.133 --> 11:15.718
from a '90s teen movie,

11:16.302 --> 11:17.303
but I'm not.

11:17.470 --> 11:18.929
And what does
any of this have to do

11:19.138 --> 11:20.264
with my mom
being a waitress?

11:20.473 --> 11:21.766
It's just that
I saw her talking to

11:21.974 --> 11:23.643
a Southside Serpent
last night,

11:23.851 --> 11:25.186
in the alley behind Pop's.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.814
They were having an extremely
heated, intimate discussion.

11:29.607 --> 11:30.733
See for yourself.

11:35.738 --> 11:38.407
Who or what is
a Southside Serpent?

11:38.616 --> 11:40.159
They're this
gang of bikers

11:40.368 --> 11:41.869
who pretty much stays
on the south side of town.

11:42.078 --> 11:43.621
And thank God, 'cause
they're sort of dangerous.

11:43.996 --> 11:45.748
Drug dealers
and petty thieves.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.125
Then what was my mom
doing with one of them?

11:51.796 --> 11:53.172
Ugh.

11:53.381 --> 11:54.965
Who knew
working would be so...

11:55.174 --> 11:56.133
Tiring.

11:56.342 --> 11:57.718
- Mom.
- Hmm?

12:00.137 --> 12:01.472
Cheryl showed me a picture.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.350
You were standing
behind Pop's

12:04.558 --> 12:06.644
with a Southside Serpent.

12:09.397 --> 12:11.816
Those guys are thugs.
What were you doing?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.944
First off, you have
nothing to worry about.

12:16.779 --> 12:17.738
Come here, sit.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.910
Now, remember Veronica,
I grew up here.

12:23.661 --> 12:24.870
The Southside Serpents may be

12:25.079 --> 12:26.122
from the wrong
side of the tracks,

12:26.330 --> 12:27.832
but I went to high school
with some of them.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.459
I was just being polite.

12:32.044 --> 12:33.796
Cheryl said it looked
like you were arguing.

12:34.004 --> 12:34.964
Arguing?

12:36.090 --> 12:37.425
Hardly.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.593
He made a lewd comment,
and I put him in his place.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.221
- Mom, if you're in some
kind of trouble...
- I'm not.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.266
<i>Mija.</i>

12:47.601 --> 12:49.270
And when have
I ever lied to you?

12:53.858 --> 12:56.235
I'm sorry,
but the Twilight Drive-In?

12:56.444 --> 12:58.863
It's a blight
that's become a cesspool,

12:59.071 --> 13:01.198
and a hangout
for criminals...

13:01.407 --> 13:02.742
...and transients,

13:02.950 --> 13:04.201
and the deal's done.

13:04.410 --> 13:05.828
Andrews Construction
is scheduled

13:06.036 --> 13:07.580
to demolish
the lot on Monday.

13:08.456 --> 13:09.373
Mayor McCoy,

13:09.999 --> 13:10.875
when I was a kid,

13:11.459 --> 13:14.253
my family and I would go
to the drive-in all the time.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.130
We couldn't afford
tickets for everyone,

13:16.338 --> 13:19.175
so my sister
Jellybean and I would
hide in the trunk

13:19.633 --> 13:21.927
until we parked.
We'd sneak out.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.389
It's like my home.

13:27.558 --> 13:30.102
That's a very sweet
sentiment, Mr. Jones.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.023
But the future of
Riverdale is at stake.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.235
Ms. Grundy showed up
in Riverdale a year ago,

13:38.444 --> 13:39.403
out of thin air.

13:39.612 --> 13:41.781
There's no record
of her before that.

13:42.490 --> 13:43.908
Her Facebook,
her Linkedln account,

13:44.116 --> 13:46.410
they were all created
one year ago.

13:46.619 --> 13:47.620
Before that, she's a ghost.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.330
She doesn't exist.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.415
The only Geraldine Grundy
I could find was

13:51.624 --> 13:53.375
a woman who died
seven years ago.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.754
How... Where did you
find all this?

13:56.962 --> 13:58.130
The deep web.

13:58.339 --> 13:59.757
The dark internet.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.468
Check it, it's all online.
Simple googling.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.179
And did you cyber-stalk
Ms. Grundy before

14:05.387 --> 14:06.263
or after you interviewed her

14:06.472 --> 14:07.556
for a fake article?

14:09.266 --> 14:10.476
Why are you doing this, Betty?

14:10.684 --> 14:12.228
- I'm not in any danger.
- You don't know that.

14:12.436 --> 14:13.729
Yeah, I do,
I'm with her.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.689
I know
what we have,

14:16.148 --> 14:17.233
and you don't.

14:18.359 --> 14:19.652
She taught Jason Blossom.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.488
- Did you know that?
- She's taught a lot of people,
Betty. What's your point?

14:22.696 --> 14:23.781
My point is,

14:23.989 --> 14:25.533
you don't know anything
about her, Archie.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.743
- Doesn't that worry you?
- Betty, let this go.

14:27.952 --> 14:29.870
- Archie, please...
- If you're really my friend,

14:30.079 --> 14:31.163
you'll let this go.

14:32.748 --> 14:33.457
Okay.

14:35.543 --> 14:36.919
I'm sorry. I'm done.

14:38.379 --> 14:39.505
I'll stop digging.

14:41.382 --> 14:42.341
I know
it's not the drive-in,

14:42.550 --> 14:44.593
but given our circumstances...

14:44.802 --> 14:45.886
It's perfect.

14:48.097 --> 14:49.348
Is everything okay?

14:51.183 --> 14:53.686
We've always been
so focused on me,

14:53.978 --> 14:56.522
my music, we never
get to talk about
you and your life.

14:59.108 --> 15:00.901
- What do you wanna know?
- I dunno.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.236
Stuff.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.322
Anything. Have you always
wanted to be a teacher?

15:05.531 --> 15:06.866
No.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.075
No, I, um...

15:09.285 --> 15:11.287
I graduated Juilliard,

15:11.495 --> 15:13.163
and I auditioned
at Carnegie Hall,

15:13.372 --> 15:15.624
Lincoln Center,
all the big symphonies,

15:15.833 --> 15:17.001
but I didn't

15:17.251 --> 15:19.211
make the cut.
Not even close.

15:20.421 --> 15:21.630
I had a dream.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.469
Sometimes that's all they are.

15:28.596 --> 15:29.513
Just dreams.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.516
And what about us?

15:34.476 --> 15:35.311
Is this a dream?

15:36.061 --> 15:36.937
Would that be so bad?

15:38.689 --> 15:39.690
If it is...

15:42.192 --> 15:43.402
It's a nice dream.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.654
Where does
this end, Geraldine?

15:49.199 --> 15:50.492
I have no idea.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.786
But we're here.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.456
And for me...

15:58.042 --> 15:59.001
That's enough.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.844
So much for
letting this go.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.851
Are we really breaking
into Grundy's car right now?

16:17.394 --> 16:18.771
How do you even know
how to do that?

16:18.979 --> 16:21.231
My dad and I
fix cars together.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.193
Thank God,
she drives an old...

16:35.371 --> 16:37.081
Okay, before
going any further,

16:37.289 --> 16:38.415
if I'm committing a felony,

16:38.624 --> 16:40.459
I need to at least
ask the question.

16:40.668 --> 16:43.087
Are you doing this
because you still have
feelings for Archie, or...

16:43.295 --> 16:44.630
No, Veronica.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.340
We're doing this because
Grundy has Archie

16:46.548 --> 16:48.717
under some kind of
sexual spell,

16:48.926 --> 16:50.302
and he won't listen to reason.

16:50.511 --> 16:53.389
We're looking for anything
that proves Grundy isn't
as clean as she says she is.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.271
Bobby pin.

17:02.356 --> 17:03.440
Okay, Ms. Gyver.

17:12.783 --> 17:14.201
I learned that
from the <i>Nancy Drew</i>

17:14.368 --> 17:15.911
- detective handbook.
- Okay, go.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.211
Oh, my God.

17:24.378 --> 17:25.838
Oh, my God.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.799
"Jennifer Gibson"?

17:29.008 --> 17:30.592
Who the hell is
Jennifer Gibson?

17:33.178 --> 17:34.555
That's not the only thing.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.112
Oh, God.

17:52.740 --> 17:55.200
Please don't tell me
you're still on
this crazy witch hunt.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.995
It's not a witch hunt,
and it's not crazy.

18:00.289 --> 18:02.291
- We were just in
Grundy's car...
- What?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.168
- You were in her car?
- Yeah,

18:04.376 --> 18:05.461
and thank God we were.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.212
- We found a gun.
- What?

18:07.421 --> 18:10.132
And an ID with
the name Jennifer Gibson.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.302
This is proof
Ms. Grundy is not
who she says she is.

18:13.510 --> 18:17.014
- Then who is she?
- Obviously some sketch-queen
named Jennifer Gibson.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.766
Archie, what if
she had something to do

18:18.974 --> 18:20.059
with Jason's murder?

18:20.476 --> 18:22.728
She taught him,
she made you lie about him,

18:22.936 --> 18:24.772
we know she was
at the river, she has a gun.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.274
So does Dilton Doiley,
but you never thought
he killed Jason.

18:27.483 --> 18:28.525
Open your eyes, Archie.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.152
Jason was her
student last year.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.280
Everything about her
is a huge, boldfaced
question mark.

18:33.489 --> 18:35.157
Okay, whatever her name is,
she's not a killer.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.867
You didn't ask her, did you?

18:37.076 --> 18:38.035
About her name?

18:38.243 --> 18:40.913
And why there's no record
of her before last year?

18:42.206 --> 18:43.999
Why not?

18:55.844 --> 18:57.471
Mayor McCoy says
you won the contract

18:57.679 --> 18:59.098
to tear down the drive-in.

19:00.933 --> 19:01.934
I did.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.853
Look, I'm sorry, Jughead.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.981
I know how much
you love the Twilight,
and so do I...

19:08.190 --> 19:10.067
Mr. Andrews,
just give me one week

19:10.275 --> 19:12.319
to track down
the person who bought
the land, and convince them

19:12.528 --> 19:14.238
not to demolish
a holy house of cinema.

19:14.446 --> 19:15.697
It's a big contract
for me, Jug,

19:15.906 --> 19:17.407
and for my guys.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.660
Whatever they build
in the place of the drive-in

19:19.868 --> 19:22.121
- could mean more jobs...
- Yeah, in what?
Some hypothetical future?

19:24.081 --> 19:25.833
You put one Jones out of work,

19:26.041 --> 19:27.501
why don't you put out
another, huh?

19:27.709 --> 19:29.878
Jug, your dad was
taking materials

19:30.087 --> 19:31.171
from one of our job sites.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.589
I had to let him go.

19:32.798 --> 19:33.841
Right.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.884
You did what you had to do,

19:36.385 --> 19:37.636
like you're doing here now.

19:38.512 --> 19:39.847
Later.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.390
Jug.

19:44.268 --> 19:45.686
You're late, Hermione.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.688
I had to make a pit stop.

19:47.855 --> 19:49.648
And as we discussed,
Madam Mayor...

19:49.982 --> 19:52.234
A donation to your
re-election campaign.

20:02.494 --> 20:05.205
And Lodge Industries
gets the Twilight Drive-In.

20:05.414 --> 20:08.500
It's one of the most
prime pieces
of real estate in Riverdale.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.924
No one can know
that I helped
goose this deal along.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.885
Especially not the Blossoms.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.219
Your secret will be
safe with me,

20:19.720 --> 20:21.555
so long as you hold up
your end of the bargain.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.566
Are you just
gonna stand there?

20:35.402 --> 20:36.612
Archie...

20:39.615 --> 20:41.992
Talk to me.
What is it?

20:42.201 --> 20:43.744
Is your real name
Jennifer Gibson?

20:49.791 --> 20:51.001
Who are you?

20:51.335 --> 20:52.628
And what are you
really doing here?

20:52.836 --> 20:54.087
- Archie...
- Why the new identity,

20:54.296 --> 20:55.756
the moving place-to-place?

20:56.924 --> 20:58.550
Tell me the truth, please.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.225
I

21:08.101 --> 21:09.478
was in a bad relationship.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.106
A relationship...
I was married

21:13.774 --> 21:15.234
to a man who would come home

21:15.817 --> 21:17.778
from work every night, late,

21:17.945 --> 21:20.197
and drunk, and with a temper.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.740
One night, I ended up

21:21.949 --> 21:23.075
in the emergency room

21:23.283 --> 21:27.663
with broken ribs and
a shattered collarbone.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.457
The next morning, he barely
even remembered the fight,

21:30.666 --> 21:31.833
and he promised

21:32.042 --> 21:33.543
that it wouldn't
happen again.

21:34.753 --> 21:35.712
But...

21:36.588 --> 21:37.547
It did,

21:38.298 --> 21:39.258
again.

21:39.925 --> 21:40.884
So...

21:42.135 --> 21:43.095
I left.

21:44.554 --> 21:45.514
And I

21:46.390 --> 21:47.599
got a divorce,

21:49.059 --> 21:50.102
changed my name...

21:51.270 --> 21:52.437
Then I came here.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.315
And I...

21:56.024 --> 21:57.109
Well...

21:58.026 --> 21:58.986
I met you.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.850
Nice murder wall,
True Detective.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.563
- Here's your High Point, Dad.
- Thanks, bud.

22:36.023 --> 22:36.857
You need somethin'?

22:37.941 --> 22:39.901
Can I borrow the truck
for the drive-in?

22:40.110 --> 22:42.154
- You got a date?
- No, I'm going with Veronica.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.780
Oh, okay.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.991
I mean, is there not a
nice gay kid at your school?

22:46.199 --> 22:47.784
Yeah. There is.

22:48.452 --> 22:49.411
Me.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.621
All right.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.332
No cruising guys tonight.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.875
Okay? We both know
what goes on
in those woods.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.294
- Oh, my God, Dad...
- No, I'm dead serious.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.171
All right, we've got
a murderer on the loose

22:59.379 --> 23:01.089
and a lot of unsavory
characters in that
part of town.

23:01.298 --> 23:02.632
So, if you go,
you stay in the truck.

23:02.841 --> 23:04.509
- All right.
- Okay?

23:04.718 --> 23:05.635
Together.

23:07.471 --> 23:09.348
We're sorry to come
unannounced, Fred.

23:09.890 --> 23:12.392
It's been a rough
couple of months for us,

23:12.601 --> 23:14.436
- but Alice and I...
- We think that
Archie and Betty

23:14.644 --> 23:16.021
should stop
spending time together.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.773
Their relationship isn't good,

23:17.981 --> 23:19.191
for either of them,

23:19.399 --> 23:21.318
and their respective
behavior reflects that.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.737
All right. So, if there
was anything that

23:23.945 --> 23:25.322
you could do on your end...

23:25.530 --> 23:26.740
My son's a good kid.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.492
I live next door, Fred.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.243
I see him
sneaking out at night,

23:30.452 --> 23:32.537
slinking off into
the darkness at all hours.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.498
Alice...

23:34.706 --> 23:36.249
Are you spying on us?

23:37.167 --> 23:38.377
Come on, Hal.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.920
We said what
we came to say,

23:40.128 --> 23:41.463
it's on him
if he ignores us.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.384
Oh, my God.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.511
Intense, right?

23:48.261 --> 23:50.430
That's why she has
a fake identity
and keeps a gun.

23:50.639 --> 23:53.016
It still doesn't make
what she did to you okay.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.768
She didn't do anything.

23:54.976 --> 23:56.853
Betty, you have to
accept that.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.397
And I'm all
she has, right now.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.482
You're in
over your head, Arch.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.776
You're in this relationship

24:02.984 --> 24:04.403
with this person
who is cutting you off

24:04.611 --> 24:06.488
from everyone else
in your life.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.532
Just think about
what you're doing, Archie.

24:09.032 --> 24:11.368
Not only for your sake,
but Ms. Grundy's.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.495
Is this really
what's best for her?

24:16.123 --> 24:17.666
I am gonna
deal with this,

24:19.084 --> 24:20.836
but on my terms,
not yours.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.464
Good day, Ms. Hermione.

24:25.882 --> 24:26.883
From the dry cleaners.

24:27.092 --> 24:28.301
Ah, thank you, Smithers.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.011
And Fred Andrews
is escorting me

24:30.220 --> 24:32.180
to the drive-in, so
all the pieces are in place.

24:32.389 --> 24:34.558
- The drive-in with
Fred Andrews?
- Yes.

24:34.766 --> 24:35.892
An attractive woman going with

24:36.101 --> 24:38.812
an old friend is
less conspicuous

24:39.020 --> 24:42.023
than an old crone going alone.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.818
You're not
an old crone,
Ms. Hermione.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.238
Of course not.
That was a joke.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.494
- Finally.
- What's wrong?

25:35.702 --> 25:37.120
What's wrong is my daughter

25:37.329 --> 25:39.080
is hiding a gun
in her bedroom,

25:39.289 --> 25:40.624
and that's just for starters.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.459
- I can explain...
- Oh, you will.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.294
Now, get in the car.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.579
Make some room, outcasts.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.417
I'm having deja vu.

26:24.918 --> 26:27.546
Yeah, senior year,
we're here, watching <i>Candyman.</i>

26:27.754 --> 26:29.714
God, I hated that movie.

26:29.923 --> 26:31.341
- You picked it.
- Mmm.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.468
Did you think
I'd get scared,
and jump into your arms

26:33.677 --> 26:35.262
like a damsel
in distress?

26:35.470 --> 26:36.638
You did kiss me that night.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.557
The briefest of flings.

26:39.266 --> 26:40.475
You kissed me.

26:46.481 --> 26:47.816
Is everything all right?

26:48.024 --> 26:49.025
Yes.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.486
I'm still hungry.
I'm gonna get
some popcorn.

26:51.695 --> 26:52.571
- Oh, I'll come.
- No.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.197
It's fine. I'm gonna
powder my nose.

26:54.406 --> 26:55.323
Excuse me.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.167
- Alice!
- I'm sorry to interrupt
your adultery, Fred,

27:06.376 --> 27:07.210
but you need to
come with me.

27:07.419 --> 27:08.336
Alice, what...

27:08.545 --> 27:09.629
It's about the kids.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.008
That hair.

27:13.216 --> 27:14.134
That jacket.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.345
Jason always
adored the drive-in.

27:23.768 --> 27:25.228
Southside trash.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.355
They've been doing that
since the opening credits.

27:28.523 --> 27:29.941
Shh!

27:30.150 --> 27:31.151
- Screw off!
- Nice haircut, you dweeb.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.202
Hey! You know
what happens to a snake

27:41.411 --> 27:42.954
when a Louis Vuitton
heel steps on it?

27:43.163 --> 27:44.956
Shut the hell up,
or you'll find out!

27:50.670 --> 27:51.713
Thank you.

27:54.424 --> 27:57.218
I cannot believe you just
threatened a gang-banger.

27:57.427 --> 27:59.220
I've dealt with worse
in the East Village.

27:59.429 --> 28:02.015
I just hate when
people disrespect
my cinematic experience.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.020
How about a refill?

28:07.687 --> 28:09.189
Yeah, Kev,
how about a refill?

28:09.397 --> 28:10.523
Cherry cola, as always.

28:33.546 --> 28:34.422
Can I get a refill?

28:41.554 --> 28:43.556
And some
gummy worms
and a cola.

28:48.478 --> 28:49.688
And a hot dog?

28:50.063 --> 28:51.523
Who am I trying to impress?

28:53.108 --> 28:54.359
We're out of dogs.

28:55.735 --> 28:56.903
Figures.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.911
Not so tough without
your beard, huh?

29:11.334 --> 29:12.293
Where's the rest of it?

29:12.502 --> 29:13.336
The rest of it?

29:14.045 --> 29:15.213
It was my understanding that

29:15.422 --> 29:16.589
that was the agreed-upon
amount.

29:19.634 --> 29:20.885
In that case,

29:21.678 --> 29:23.930
maybe we need to have
a word with your husband.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.141
Good luck with that.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.520
As long as Hiram's in jail,
you'll be dealing with me.

29:31.229 --> 29:32.272
Mmm-hmm.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.274
- Is that a problem?
- Mmm.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.529
Enjoy the movie, Hermione.

29:40.864 --> 29:42.115
We'll be in touch.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.127
No drive-in for you tonight?

29:54.878 --> 29:55.837
I got you something.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.172
Is this to make me feel better

29:57.380 --> 29:59.132
about my tragic past?

29:59.340 --> 30:00.300
No.

30:01.801 --> 30:02.594
It's a...

30:02.802 --> 30:04.053
It's a thank-you gift
for everything

30:04.262 --> 30:05.054
you've done for me.

30:15.023 --> 30:15.940
Archie...

30:17.901 --> 30:18.568
This...

30:20.153 --> 30:21.154
You cannot afford this.

30:21.362 --> 30:22.530
I pawned one of my guitars.

30:23.656 --> 30:24.532
Why?

30:25.950 --> 30:27.368
You don't need to thank me.

30:27.577 --> 30:28.536
You shouldn't...

30:29.829 --> 30:30.789
...thank me.

30:34.876 --> 30:35.835
Ms. Grundy,

30:36.044 --> 30:38.630
I don't, I don't want to end
our lessons, but...

30:41.841 --> 30:43.635
But that's what
you think we should do?

30:44.260 --> 30:45.261
Don't you?

30:50.308 --> 30:54.521
So, that bow
is a goodbye gift?

30:56.731 --> 30:58.858
It's a
see-you-around-the-halls
gift.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.194
A don't-forget-me gift.

31:02.946 --> 31:04.322
That is hardly likely.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.041
Well, well, well.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.001
There they are.
What did I tell you?

31:17.210 --> 31:18.837
Can someone tell me
what's going on here?

31:19.045 --> 31:20.713
Of course. Archie,

31:20.922 --> 31:22.006
would you like to
share with us

31:22.215 --> 31:22.966
what you and Mrs. Robinson

31:23.174 --> 31:24.926
have been doing
during your "music lesson"?

31:25.134 --> 31:27.470
And please don't leave out
any of the lurid details,

31:27.679 --> 31:30.598
because Betty here
keeps a very meticulous diary,

31:30.807 --> 31:33.101
and I'm more than happy
to fill in the details.

31:44.779 --> 31:45.780
Okay, okay.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.490
This time I really need to go.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.582
I'm Joaquin, by the way.

31:56.791 --> 31:57.792
Give me your phone.

32:00.169 --> 32:02.630
This is my number.

32:02.839 --> 32:03.798
Use it.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.467
Kevin Keller...

32:06.676 --> 32:09.304
As in Sheriff Keller?

32:09.512 --> 32:10.513
Is that a problem?

32:13.516 --> 32:14.851
Is this a problem?

32:17.937 --> 32:19.063
I won't tell
if you won't.

32:23.568 --> 32:25.778
I never thought that
I would live to see the day.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.573
I thought the one thing
that we could keep
our Riverdale safe from

32:28.781 --> 32:30.158
was child predators.

32:30.366 --> 32:32.410
Ms. Grundy's not a predator.
She's a good person.

32:32.619 --> 32:33.745
Archie, you don't
have to defend me.

32:33.953 --> 32:34.871
No, he doesn't.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.164
Well,

32:36.372 --> 32:37.665
they're not
denying it, are they?

32:37.874 --> 32:39.083
They're clearly guilty.
I think the next step is

32:39.292 --> 32:40.668
we take this
to Sheriff Keller,

32:40.877 --> 32:42.795
and let the wheels
of justice take over.

32:43.004 --> 32:43.880
Dad, you can't
let that happen.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.633
- Son, it's complicated.
- She didn't force me
to do anything,

32:46.841 --> 32:47.842
I went after her.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.886
Everything that happened,
I wanted it to happen.

32:50.094 --> 32:51.346
There's no surprise there.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.056
Why are you
doing this, Mom?

32:53.264 --> 32:54.766
Putting Ms. Grundy on trial?

32:54.974 --> 32:56.267
This isn't just about her.

32:57.226 --> 32:58.436
This is about him.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.356
I want you see
what kind of person

33:01.564 --> 33:02.815
Archie truly is.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.359
Wait a minute, that is
what this is about?

33:04.567 --> 33:06.945
Your crazy grudge
against my teenage son?

33:07.153 --> 33:10.031
I'm never going to stop being
friends with Archie, Mom.

33:10.239 --> 33:11.282
- Ever.
- We are done here.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.201
- Oh, we are far
from being done here.
- Stop.

33:13.409 --> 33:14.285
- Shut up.
- Stop!

33:14.494 --> 33:15.578
Please.

33:17.497 --> 33:18.665
You're right, Mrs. Cooper.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.500
You're right. I'm selfish,

33:20.708 --> 33:22.377
and I'm stupid, and
I don't deserve to be

33:22.585 --> 33:23.920
your daughter's friend.

33:24.295 --> 33:25.964
But please,
don't hurt Ms. Grundy

33:26.172 --> 33:27.215
because you wanna hurt me.

33:28.549 --> 33:31.094
This isn't about
hurting anyone, Archie.

33:32.595 --> 33:33.721
It's about
doing what's right,

33:35.139 --> 33:36.641
and, of course,
informing our neighbors.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.267
Alice, I swear to God...

33:38.476 --> 33:40.520
- You swear to God...
- Publish one word
about this, Mom,

33:40.728 --> 33:43.606
and I will tell everyone that
I broke into Ms. Grundy's car.

33:43.815 --> 33:45.441
- Betty...
- That I robbed her,

33:45.650 --> 33:47.652
and made up
the story of their affair.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.864
It will be like,
I finally...

33:52.657 --> 33:53.616
Snapped.

33:54.701 --> 33:55.618
Like Polly.

33:55.827 --> 33:58.579
- Betty...
- It'll prove what everyone
already thinks about us.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.498
"Crazy runs in that family."

34:02.458 --> 34:03.668
Like mother, like daughter.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.128
- You wouldn't dare.
- I'll quit.

34:08.256 --> 34:10.341
I'll quit my job.
Will that satisfy you?

34:10.967 --> 34:12.218
Yeah, it will. It has to.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.971
And I absolutely
would dare, Mom.

34:18.766 --> 34:19.767
She has to leave town.

34:19.976 --> 34:21.477
- The hell she does.
- Son.

34:21.686 --> 34:23.312
Why does she need
to leave town?

34:23.521 --> 34:25.773
Because it's what's best.

34:25.982 --> 34:27.900
And Alice will keep her word.

34:28.317 --> 34:31.029
- I will.
- I'll pack up my things,
I'll be gone by morning.

34:31.779 --> 34:32.613
Ms. Grundy.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.304
How'd you like the movie?

34:57.513 --> 34:58.931
Quite the twist ending.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.116
Oh, my God.

35:37.345 --> 35:39.138
- Veronica.
- What the hell was that?

35:40.598 --> 35:42.767
I saw you with that biker guy,

35:43.518 --> 35:44.685
that Serpent.

35:45.645 --> 35:47.772
And don't tell me
you were just being polite.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.525
I was handling some
unfinished business
for your father.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.443
I'm gonna need
more than that, Mom.

35:53.861 --> 35:54.987
Details,

35:55.196 --> 35:56.114
specifics.

35:57.490 --> 35:58.533
All right, then.

36:00.743 --> 36:04.455
Your father hired
the Southside Serpents

36:04.664 --> 36:07.583
to help decrease the value
of the drive-in's land

36:08.167 --> 36:09.794
so he could purchase it
at a cheaper price

36:10.002 --> 36:11.462
using an offshore LLC.

36:12.797 --> 36:14.382
What you saw was
me paying them

36:14.590 --> 36:15.424
for a job well done.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.051
So...

36:18.386 --> 36:19.804
Daddy's the anonymous buyer?

36:21.389 --> 36:23.057
And he's doing this from jail?

36:23.850 --> 36:26.018
He has an extremely
long reach, your father.

36:26.227 --> 36:29.188
And he's sunk every last penny
that we have into this deal.

36:30.064 --> 36:31.023
So...

36:31.732 --> 36:32.984
Dad really is...

36:33.192 --> 36:35.319
Dad is a businessman.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.240
He saw an opportunity,
and he took it.

36:39.991 --> 36:41.200
And it was happening anyway.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.744
Old Riverdale's dying.

36:43.953 --> 36:46.372
He's just simply
helping it along.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.166
- But it's wrong.
- Wrong?

36:50.543 --> 36:51.711
Well, did you like
living at the Dakota

36:51.919 --> 36:52.879
with a Central Park view?

36:53.796 --> 36:56.340
Did you like
your personal shopping
account at Barneys?

36:57.133 --> 36:59.343
How about our family dinners
at Jean Georges?

36:59.552 --> 37:00.720
Your Hermes?

37:00.928 --> 37:04.599
- Those were
just things, Mom...
- That was our life, Ronnie,

37:04.807 --> 37:06.726
provided to us
by your father.

37:09.896 --> 37:10.980
Understand?

37:31.876 --> 37:32.835
You are not

37:33.920 --> 37:35.338
those things you said.

37:37.215 --> 37:38.257
You're not stupid.

37:41.469 --> 37:42.929
This wasn't your fault.

37:58.069 --> 37:59.028
<i>Betty.</i>

38:00.696 --> 38:04.116
Polly kept so,
so many secrets from us.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.917
I won't have any more
secrets between us.

38:16.420 --> 38:17.797
Not anymore.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.757
Not if I'm gonna
keep you safe.

38:22.885 --> 38:24.011
What's my name, Mom?

38:25.930 --> 38:26.889
Say it.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.977
- Elizabeth Cooper.
- That's right.

38:32.228 --> 38:34.438
I am Elizabeth,
I am not Polly.

38:34.647 --> 38:35.940
Archie is not Jason.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.400
So stop using them

38:37.608 --> 38:39.777
as an excuse
to control my life!

39:55.519 --> 39:59.106
"<i>Dear Diary, love
makes you do crazy things,</i>

39:59.315 --> 40:02.443
<i>"and maybe some of what I did
was wrong, but maybe...</i>

40:04.653 --> 40:07.239
<i>"Maybe I was right
about some things, too.</i>

40:09.408 --> 40:12.161
<i>"Maybe Ms. Grundy
was dangerous in some way.</i>

40:17.750 --> 40:18.918
<i>"Tomorrow morning,
when we wake up,</i>

40:19.126 --> 40:21.670
<i>"the world will,
yet again, be changed."</i>

41:15.724 --> 41:17.852
They'll tear
that booth down, too.

41:18.060 --> 41:20.396
Raze the whole place.
Send it to the junkyard.

41:21.272 --> 41:22.314
And us with it.

41:22.857 --> 41:23.774
Yeah...

41:23.983 --> 41:25.276
Maybe they'll save it.

41:26.235 --> 41:27.319
All the pieces.

41:27.528 --> 41:29.113
Store it in
the town hall attic,

41:29.321 --> 41:31.115
and rebuild it
in a hundred years.

41:31.323 --> 41:32.741
Wonder who the hell we were.

41:34.118 --> 41:35.453
Hmm.

41:37.538 --> 41:38.873
So where are you
gonna live now?

41:40.791 --> 41:41.959
I'll figure it out, Dad.

41:45.129 --> 41:46.172
I always do.
