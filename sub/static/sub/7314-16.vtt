WEBVTT

00:21.287 --> 00:22.521
What are we waiting for?

00:22.523 --> 00:23.622
To see how much
we're gonna charge.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.391
Over here.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.760
Oh, my gosh,
I am so glad that you came.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.294
Double-time.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.596
Woman: I'm in a panic!
I'm so desperate!

00:30.598 --> 00:32.631
They're coming at 10:00.
All of them.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.567
I'm hosting the entire
mahjong league for brunch.

00:35.569 --> 00:36.568
Let me guess, toilet?

00:36.570 --> 00:38.670
Oh, toilet stuff everywhere.

00:38.672 --> 00:42.674
Eh, it's probably just roots
in your, uh, sewer line.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.410
We'll have
everything flowing in an hour.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.577
How's $350 sound?

00:45.579 --> 00:47.679
(screeching)

00:47.681 --> 00:49.581
Oh, hey! Two, even.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.716
And I'll pay the tax.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.717
Oh, my god.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.552
(panting)

00:56.656 --> 00:58.724
Hey, hey, fella.
Hey, buddy,
are you okay?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.392
Hey,
fella, slow down.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.127
Let's, uh, get you
some help or something.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02.129 --> 01:03.729
Man, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
Hey, man.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.697
There's nothing
for you in that truck.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.299
Hey, w-what are you...?

01:07.301 --> 01:09.401
Hey, that's drain cleaner.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.236
(woman gasping)
hey, don't-- what are you doing?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.271
(choking)

01:12.273 --> 01:14.473
Oh, my god.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.774
Oh...!
(choking)

01:16.709 --> 01:18.343
Plumber:
Oh, no...

01:18.345 --> 01:19.445
Oh, god!

01:19.447 --> 01:21.580
(retching)

01:21.582 --> 01:23.749
Oh, my god, call 911.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.452
Oh, my god. Oh.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.654
(groaning)

01:28.656 --> 01:29.822
Sorry, lady.

01:29.824 --> 01:32.758
Might need two hours.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.128
$40, $60, $80, $100.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.798
$20, $40, $60, $80, $200.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.399
It's just a lump,
on my shoulder.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.501
What's the big deal?

02:15.503 --> 02:17.436
I'm not going to
touch your lump, tony.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.670
What's the big deal
about that?

02:18.672 --> 02:19.805
$200 even.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.473
Thank you so much.
You are a lifesaver.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.541
Shh, he's here.

02:24.844 --> 02:25.911
(chuckling):
What?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.213
What what?
What? There's no what.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.915
It looks like
a what to me-- ziva?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.650
Jimmy gave mcgee
several hundred dollars

02:31.652 --> 02:32.784
In exchange
for an envelope

02:32.786 --> 02:35.654
Oh, come on, how
could you see that?

02:35.656 --> 02:38.891
Tony: James palmer,
you take one more step

02:38.893 --> 02:43.228
And I will forward that
e-mail you accidently sent me,

02:43.230 --> 02:45.764
(quietly):
To the entire building.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.466
Smart gremlin. Now talk.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.835
It was nothing;
it was nothing.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.871
Agent mcgee and I,
we just, um...

02:54.807 --> 02:56.575
(clears throat)

02:56.577 --> 02:58.243
He-he got me some last-minute
concert tickets

02:58.245 --> 03:00.679
For my nine-month
anniversary present for breena.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.181
Concert tickets?

03:02.183 --> 03:03.315
Wait a minute.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.517
You have a concert
ticket connection?

03:05.519 --> 03:06.818
No.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.253
You're a bad liar.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.755
Why'd you even say anything,
ziva?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.657
Because I didn't know you
were getting jimmy tickets.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.691
They usually come
in a blue envelope.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.326
Ziva...!
Wait a minute,

03:14.328 --> 03:15.494
You got ziva tickets, too?

03:15.496 --> 03:16.895
Relax, tony, it's
been a while, okay?

03:16.897 --> 03:18.797
Last time, I think it was,
what, like, six years ago?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.265
What, no, no.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.266
Six years ago!

03:21.268 --> 03:23.202
Tony:
Wait a second.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.870
You've been hiding a ticket
connection for six years?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.371
Who else have you
gotten tickets for?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.439
Nobody.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.874
Man:
Psst! Mcgee.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.244
Tony: You got
him tickets?

03:35.582 --> 03:37.382
You and I are going
to have a little talk.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.585
You can do that in the car.
Grab your snack bag.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.852
We got a dead navy officer.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.454
Uh, snack bag?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.755
Gibbs:
Body's in richmond.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.458
Boss, is there any way we can
take separate cars?

03:55.401 --> 03:57.869
Well, witnesses
all say the same thing:

03:57.871 --> 03:59.938
Our victim,
lieutenant gordon roth,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.241
Stumbled down the street,
jumped in the van,

04:02.243 --> 04:03.775
Then chugged a
bottle of drain cleaner.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.911
Yeah, he had to know
it would be fatal.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.746
Which would make this
a simple suicide.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.881
Right before our
victim showed up,

04:09.883 --> 04:11.817
He blew a stop sign
about a mile away.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.286
Patrol car tried to pull
him over and give him...

04:14.288 --> 04:16.488
What are those
things called again?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.857
Ticket.
Ticket, of course.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.926
Like the kind of thing you'd
need to go see a concert.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.995
Anyway, roth
didn't pull over.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.363
Got into a
high-speed chase,

04:24.365 --> 04:25.864
Ditched his car

04:25.866 --> 04:27.432
And then, when the cops
finally caught up with him,

04:27.434 --> 04:30.035
Do you think he was injured
during the chase?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.403
I don't think so.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.704
Why is he bleeding?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.539
I believe that is my cue.

04:34.541 --> 04:38.310
M.E. Van's has been refusing to
go above 50 in cold weather.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.946
I see our victim
is well worth the wait.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.914
(chuckling):
Drain cleaner.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.049
Lovely.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.751
Jimmy:
And he's been shot.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.520
Ducky: Judging by the severity
of the ecchymosis,

04:48.522 --> 04:49.721
He would have
been dead in minutes

04:49.723 --> 04:52.057
Had he not
killed himself first.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.025
Then why kill himself?

04:53.027 --> 04:54.826
So much for "simple."

04:54.828 --> 04:56.995
Ducky:
His knuckles are bruised
and some are broken.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.499
He must've been in some kind of
altercation before he died.

05:00.501 --> 05:04.670
Oh! I'll know more
when I conduct a full autopsy.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.504
You always do, duck,

05:05.506 --> 05:06.938
You always do.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.006
All right, pack it up.

05:12.712 --> 05:13.979
Death by drain cleaner.

05:13.981 --> 05:18.016
Yes, but the ingestion of
such a caustic substance

05:18.018 --> 05:21.953
Promises to make this a
most interesting autopsy.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.525
All right, inferior
or superior process

05:26.527 --> 05:27.993
Of the distal
phalange, doctor?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.861
Inferior.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.798
Inferior it is.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.899
Looks like
you're driving.

05:33.901 --> 05:34.966
As if.

05:34.968 --> 05:35.967
Excuse me?

05:35.969 --> 05:38.370
Looks "as if" you're driving.

05:43.609 --> 05:46.845
So, I suggest we take
the 288 to the toll road,

05:46.847 --> 05:49.481
And then the 95 back to d.C.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.883
Oh, no, the forecast
calls for snow.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.919
We'd be better
off avoiding traffic

05:53.921 --> 05:55.520
If we take the back roads.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.728
Man: They're leaving the
scene, and they have the body.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.029
Woman:
Stay close.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.530
Don't lose them.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.965
Copy that.

06:13.606 --> 06:14.873
It's Tuesday.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.541
Who gets first
dibs on the radio?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.043
That would be me.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.444
And I think you
knew that.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.645
Perhaps I did.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.813
(chuckling)

06:29.655 --> 06:31.490
Ziva:
Lieutenant gordon roth, 29,

06:31.492 --> 06:34.092
Served at the uss <i>carl vinson</i>
<i>during the iraq war,</i>

06:34.094 --> 06:35.427
Until he was reassigned due to
hearing loss.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.461
Where?

06:36.463 --> 06:37.696
Tony:
Office of naval research.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.631
They're the guys who
coordinate the science

06:39.633 --> 06:41.500
And technology
programs for the navy.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.568
Is that what
they do, mcgee?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.003
Sorry, boss.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.805
I just thought, 'cause
it was science-related...

06:46.807 --> 06:48.140
You'd insult gibbs'
intelligence?

06:48.142 --> 06:49.808
No. Don't listen
to him, boss.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.176
He's just mad
because I...

06:51.178 --> 06:52.677
I don't care.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.947
But roth wasn't
your ordinary egghead.

06:55.949 --> 06:56.948
Ziva:
His performance
tests indicate

06:56.950 --> 06:58.917
He had an
extremely high iq.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.786
He wrote several
papers on high-end

07:00.788 --> 07:01.953
Military encryption.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.789
Which, without
any advanced degrees,

07:03.791 --> 07:04.890
Is almost unheard of.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.592
It's always the
eggheads who crack.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.894
Get it? Egg? Crack?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.562
Ziva: We looked for
a suicide note

07:10.564 --> 07:11.830
But did not find one.

07:11.832 --> 07:12.931
Abby's going through
his computer now.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.800
Family?
Mcgee:
None.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.768
No brothers and sisters,
and parents are deceased.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.170
They were only children,
so no aunts and uncles

07:18.172 --> 07:19.471
To talk to, either.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.839
That leaves his c.O.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.908
Dinozzo, take...
Yes, boss?

07:25.611 --> 07:26.711
Take mcgee with you.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.782
Looks like you two have
some things to work out.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.992
(latin music playing over radio)

07:40.994 --> 07:42.928
Jimmy: Doctor, I do see
some clouds moving in.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.763
This drive could take a while.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.766
What do you say
we finish that crossword?

07:47.768 --> 07:49.935
What's a nine-letter word
for fungus?

07:51.804 --> 07:53.805
Toadstool.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.806
Amazing.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.709
When you die, I want
to dissect your brain.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.745
I would consider it an honor
and a privilege, mr. Palmer.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.547
However, I consider it
a necessity

08:02.549 --> 08:03.715
We get this van fixed.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.217
Oh, we're behind schedule.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.952
Yeah,
gus in the motor pool says

08:06.954 --> 08:10.789
Said he's changed it
three times already.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.925
Well, perhaps
we should change gus.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.167
Think it's time
we change the station.
What?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.735
It's my turn again,

08:23.737 --> 08:26.738
And, uh, no offense,
but I'm getting a headache.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.207
Well, if it's your turn,
it's your turn.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.208
Ah, much better.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.010
(sudden explosion)

08:32.012 --> 08:33.278
Oh! Ah...

08:35.014 --> 08:36.114
That sounded like a blowout.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.083
That's weird.
I just changed the tire.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.284
Yes, well, it looks
as if you're gonna

08:39.286 --> 08:40.619
Have to change
one of them again.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.731
Look, I've got a cousin that
works for a concert promoter.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.666
Every now and then,
he helps me get tickets.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.700
It's not a big deal.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.701
Then why didn't
I know about it?

08:56.703 --> 08:57.836
You know why.

08:57.838 --> 08:58.937
If I knew why
I didn't know,

08:58.939 --> 09:01.873
Then I would know
what I didn't know.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.775
You're a bad man.
You know what,
I didn't tell you

09:03.777 --> 09:05.210
Because I knew that you
would take advantage of it.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.946
You saying I'm a bad man?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.115
Woman: Should I
come back later?

09:10.117 --> 09:11.950
Commander lisa cleveland.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.320
But please...
Don't let me interrupt.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.292
Are you sure there hasn't
been some kind of mistake?

09:20.294 --> 09:21.693
Yes, ma'am.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.128
Lieutenant roth
killed himself this morning.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.565
That's quite a shock.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.933
You have any idea why?

09:27.935 --> 09:29.100
No.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.602
That's why we wanted
to talk to you.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.571
I don't know what I can offer,

09:32.573 --> 09:35.040
Except that roth
was the epitome of stability.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.075
Was he close with
anyone in the office?
Not really.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.677
Kept mostly to himself.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.211
Any enemies?
No.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.914
Is there something else
you aren't telling me?

09:45.851 --> 09:47.185
Lieutenant roth
was beaten and shot

09:47.187 --> 09:48.954
Just prior to his suicide.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.357
Quite a detail to leave out,
don't you think?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.992
Depends.
On?

09:53.994 --> 09:56.061
On whether or not
we think you're involved.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.862
We know it's personal,
but we just thought we'd ask.

09:57.864 --> 09:58.897
Are you involved?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.265
No, I'm not.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.033
But I wish you had
said something sooner.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.371
Lieutenant roth
oversaw the implementation

10:06.373 --> 10:08.840
Of the navy's datakey
encryption protocols.

10:08.842 --> 10:09.908
I see.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.142
What does that mean?

10:11.144 --> 10:13.011
Means he spent
a lot of time around

10:13.013 --> 10:14.779
Highly classified materials.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.649
The kind people might kill for?

10:21.954 --> 10:23.254
(grunts)

10:23.256 --> 10:25.757
Almost done.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.791
Any luck?

10:26.793 --> 10:28.293
No, which is odd.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.963
I expected to find the
entire sidewall blown out,

10:31.965 --> 10:34.366
Given the
explosive decompression

10:34.368 --> 10:36.735
We just experienced.

10:36.737 --> 10:37.902
Yeah, well,
my stomach is

10:37.904 --> 10:39.871
Experiencing
explosive decompression.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.373
(laughing)

10:41.375 --> 10:44.042
I'm hungry.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.711
What do you say we break out
these emergency supplies?

10:46.713 --> 10:48.380
Yeah, well,
we did skip breakfast.

10:48.382 --> 10:49.648
Wait a minute.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.082
What have we here?

10:53.886 --> 10:56.888
Something embedded...

10:56.890 --> 10:58.790
Hello, hello, hello.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.225
Mr. Palmer...

11:01.894 --> 11:03.228
Is that a...

11:03.230 --> 11:05.964
Yeah, appears to be
a bullet fragment.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.371
I apologize for that.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.040
I told my men to slow you down.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.909
I was stuck in traffic
on the toll road.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.045
May-may we help you?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.980
Maybe.
If either of them move...

11:45.271 --> 11:47.105
It's not here.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.440
You didn't think
it would be.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.241
No.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.813
So plan b it is.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.982
May I ask who you are?

11:57.984 --> 12:01.019
And what exactly is plan b?

12:01.021 --> 12:02.887
Plan b is "drive."

12:14.166 --> 12:16.968
What kind of classified material
was roth working on?

12:16.970 --> 12:20.138
We're getting a little push-back
on access.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.440
Push harder.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.476
Duck, talk to me.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.250
Duck?

12:57.009 --> 12:58.843
Inside.

13:00.212 --> 13:02.113
Y-y-you...

13:02.115 --> 13:04.015
You know... You know,
over 15,000 people

13:04.017 --> 13:05.450
Are injured in gun
accidents every year.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.051
Ducky:
Now, since we are miles from,

13:07.053 --> 13:08.286
Well, from anything,

13:08.288 --> 13:10.155
Would you mind pointing that
someplace else?

13:10.157 --> 13:12.056
Sure.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.158
Uh...

13:13.160 --> 13:15.059
My bad.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.061
Get inside.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.801
Woman:
Sorry about the mess.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.035
I'm sure you'll be

13:24.037 --> 13:26.204
More cooperative than
our last visitors.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.907
Lock them up.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.241
No.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.976
No, I've had enough
for one day.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.413
I demand to know who you are
and what this is about.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.981
If you want my men
to put the guns down,

13:36.983 --> 13:38.416
You'll let them
put those on.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.919
Or we can wait
for one of those

13:40.921 --> 13:42.554
Accidents to happen.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.457
I-I vote for the leg irons.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.234
Now, what happened
to lieutenant roth?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.002
Uh...

13:58.004 --> 13:59.604
Ducky:
He allegedly killed himself.

13:59.606 --> 14:03.241
And before that?
He looked beat up.
Was he in a fight?

14:03.243 --> 14:06.010
Ducky:
Well, I can't say
with any certainty.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.214
I was kidnapped before I could
conduct my autopsy.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.850
Did he have
anything on him

14:11.852 --> 14:13.051
When you found him?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.019
No, not that I am aware.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.921
No, he wouldn't have
had it with him.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.456
Not if he had decided
to kill himself.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.992
Woman: Marcus, go back
and search the area.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.461
Lincoln,
bring the body in.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.097
You can conduct your autopsy

14:26.099 --> 14:28.199
Here.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.168
(scoffing):
I beg your pardon.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.370
A dead body can still speak.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.105
Yes, so I've noticed.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.540
I need to find out
what happened

14:35.542 --> 14:37.342
To lieutenant roth.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.078
And you are my best shot.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.980
And if I refuse?

14:42.948 --> 14:45.383
Take a guess.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.586
Good luck with your autopsy
if you kill me.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.088
Woman:
I won't kill you.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.657
I'll kill your friend.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.960
Slowly.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.164
I vote for the autopsy.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.166
Agreed.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.535
We're gonna need
some things from the van.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.138
Anything I find
won't be useful

15:07.140 --> 15:09.607
To anybody if we all die

15:09.609 --> 15:13.278
From airborne
corpse pathogens.

15:15.147 --> 15:18.016
A dead body
can be deadly.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.586
Hey, abby,
you heard anything from...

15:21.588 --> 15:22.954
The police?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.188
That impounded
lieutenant roth's car

15:24.190 --> 15:26.157
After the high-speed
chase? Yep.
No.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.225
No, that's not
what I was asking.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.128
Because they dropped it off
an hour ago,

15:30.130 --> 15:31.663
And I found
much goodness inside.

15:31.665 --> 15:33.197
No, I was hoping...
You were hoping

15:33.199 --> 15:38.169
I have got prints
to run, I've got

15:38.171 --> 15:40.204
Blood swabs, and I have
the cherry on top

15:40.206 --> 15:42.173
Of my forensic banana split:
Abby...

15:42.175 --> 15:44.509
This stylish, yet compact,
digital camera.

15:44.511 --> 15:45.977
Abby...
I know. Get to the point.

15:45.979 --> 15:49.280
And compact digital camera
is gps-enabled,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.581
Which means I know

15:50.583 --> 15:52.483
Where roth was
before he killed himself,

15:52.485 --> 15:54.185
And what he was doing.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.219
Yeah? Where was he?

15:55.221 --> 15:57.622
He was in a park

15:57.624 --> 16:00.191
About two miles away
from the crime scene,

16:00.193 --> 16:03.094
Walking around in circles
and taking pictures

16:03.096 --> 16:06.197
Of everybody and everything,
for over half an hour.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.699
And when I say circles,

16:07.701 --> 16:09.100
I mean circles.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.568
This is a
connect-the-dot map

16:10.570 --> 16:12.103
Of all the gps coordinates

16:12.105 --> 16:14.305
From every photograph
that roth took.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.742
I'm assuming this isn't some
kind of obsessive-compulsive,

16:17.744 --> 16:20.144
Circle-walking,
picture-taking illness,

16:20.146 --> 16:22.113
Although that's
more ducky's territory.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.314
You heard from ducky?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.582
No. Where is he?

16:24.584 --> 16:27.185
He's got my hair samples
and my fingernail samples.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.219
I'm gonna call him.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.989
Ducky (recorded):
Sorry I missed you.

16:30.991 --> 16:31.990
Please leave a message

16:31.992 --> 16:33.725
After the tone.
That's odd.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.126
He never turns his cell off.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.327
I'm gonna call jimmy.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.396
Jimmy (recorded):
Hey, jimmy's cell phone.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.398
He's not around
to pick me up right now,

16:40.400 --> 16:42.000
So please leave a message.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.668
Odd, the sequel.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.370
Permission to track
their phones, sir?

16:45.372 --> 16:46.404
When they're turned off?

16:46.406 --> 16:47.472
Well, I wouldn't
be able to track

16:47.474 --> 16:49.240
Ducky's model of phone,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.476
But as long as jimmy's battery
hasn't been removed,

16:51.478 --> 16:53.277
Even if it's dead,

16:53.279 --> 16:54.612
I can still get a trickle charge

16:54.614 --> 16:56.381
That'll power up the...

16:57.316 --> 16:58.516
His battery's been removed.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.184
According to this error code.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.020
Why would jimmy do that?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.187
He wouldn't.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.089
We spoke to gus
in the motor pool.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.491
He said jimmy called
about an hour and a half

17:06.493 --> 17:07.525
After we left the crime scene.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.093
Said he had a flat tire.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.262
Gus told jimmy it'd take
a few hours to get out there,

17:11.264 --> 17:12.330
So jimmy said
he'd fix it himself.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.599
Mcgee?
Running a trace on the call.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.201
What are you thinking?
Thinking I want to know
where the hell they are.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.771
Well, it would have
had to be bad enough

17:19.773 --> 17:21.105
To destroy jimmy's cell.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.440
Got a hit.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.709
They were on
veterans memorial highway,

17:24.711 --> 17:28.146
Looks like they were heading
north before they made the call.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.580
There's emergency
cameras on vmh.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.417
Backtracking from the time
of the call.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.121
There they are.

17:38.524 --> 17:39.657
Jumping to the next camera.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.268
And jumping to the next camera.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.541
Freeze it.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.742
Back up the first
two cameras.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.516
That black suv's
in every photo.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.351
Ziva:
There are a lot of
exits on that stretch.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.188
Jimmy said the van
didn't go over 50.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.522
Speed limit's 60.
They were being followed.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.657
Mcgee, ziva, bolo.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.359
Pulled over somewhere--
find out where.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.627
On our way.
Dinozzo.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.329
Lieutenant roth?
Find out what he was into.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.865
Right now we don't have a clue.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.634
Ducky:
<i>If you would be</i>

18:23.636 --> 18:26.104
So kind, mr. Palmer.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.305
But be careful.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.174
The sodium hydroxide
in the drain cleaner

18:30.176 --> 18:32.376
Is still rather potent.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.511
You weren't kidding.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.379
The esophagus
looks like it's melted.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.747
Yeah.
What do you got?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.249
A mess.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.351
Contrary to
popular belief,

18:40.353 --> 18:42.587
Drain cleaner does not
function as a poison.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.189
It kills by asphyxiation,

18:45.191 --> 18:48.159
And that is a result of
a rather drastic reaction

18:48.161 --> 18:50.361
Between
sodium hydroxide and...

18:50.363 --> 18:52.430
And I couldn't care less.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.764
Well, you wouldn't
be the first.

18:53.766 --> 18:57.468
Apart from a
removable hearing aid,

18:57.470 --> 19:00.638
Which I can find no
physiological need for,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.673
Our victim was in good health.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.843
Oh, he was in some
kind of altercation

19:05.845 --> 19:07.445
Just prior to his suicide.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.380
Jimmy: Aside from
being shot, he has

19:09.382 --> 19:12.350
His knuckles scraped,
three broken digits,

19:12.352 --> 19:16.287
I can pull back the skin,
if you'd like to...

19:16.289 --> 19:17.455
We're good.
Enough.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.390
Woman:
You know what I want to hear,

19:19.392 --> 19:20.458
So let's hear it.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.326
Well, the angle

19:22.328 --> 19:24.662
Of the damage to
the thoracic area

19:24.664 --> 19:26.464
Indicates that you're
looking for a male,

19:26.466 --> 19:28.366
Roughly six foot tall.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.334
Here-- skin cells
from under this man's nails

19:30.336 --> 19:32.937
Suggests a caucasian,

19:32.939 --> 19:35.306
And a follicle which we found

19:35.308 --> 19:39.177
Lets us know that there are
at least some dark hair.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.812
Undoubtedly, I will learn more

19:41.814 --> 19:44.348
As we continue
the autopsy.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.550
For example,

19:45.552 --> 19:47.385
Uh, the contents

19:47.387 --> 19:49.487
Of the stomach...

19:50.856 --> 19:52.223
...Will tell us...

19:52.958 --> 19:54.358
(coughs)

19:54.360 --> 19:56.527
(retches)

19:56.529 --> 19:57.862
Woman:
I... Okay.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.197
I got it.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.399
Now just finish up.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.533
Keep an eye on them.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.502
You mind if I do it
from outside?

20:04.504 --> 20:05.503
Fine.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.271
They're not going anywhere.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.384
(man coughs)

20:21.820 --> 20:23.421
Well, you did that on purpose.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.457
About?
About what
we're gonna do.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.892
They're gonna kill us
when... When we're done.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.527
I know, I know.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.363
I-I-I've been trying not
to think about it, and...

20:32.365 --> 20:33.431
What can we do?

20:33.433 --> 20:35.466
We go on the offensive.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.001
On the offen... With what?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.636
Duck, we are chained
to the floor.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.971
They have guns.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.872
We don't have much
in the weapons department.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.742
We have something better
than a weapon, mr. Palmer.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.510
We have him.

21:00.626 --> 21:01.792
(elevator bell dings)

21:01.794 --> 21:03.661
Hey, you find
the m.E. Van?

21:03.663 --> 21:06.264
Nope, and no sign of
ducky or jimmy, either.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.732
But we do know
where they stopped.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.900
We found a flat tire
on the shoulder of the highway.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.535
It was not a blowout, gibbs.

21:11.537 --> 21:12.837
The tire was shot out.

21:15.407 --> 21:16.741
There was a second
vehicle there,

21:16.743 --> 21:17.808
Definitely.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.277
We lifted tracks
and at least

21:19.279 --> 21:20.745
Four sets of footprints.

21:20.747 --> 21:21.746
Ziva: Abby's processing
them now.

21:21.748 --> 21:22.780
But the footprints
indicate

21:22.782 --> 21:23.914
That somebody else joined

21:23.916 --> 21:25.750
Ducky and jimmy
in the m.E. Van.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.018
They were likely forced
to drive under duress.

21:27.020 --> 21:28.052
Any luck with the

21:28.054 --> 21:29.453
Rest of the traffic cam footage?

21:29.455 --> 21:32.356
They knew how to stay
away from the camera.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.925
Of very special
agent anthony dinozzo.

21:34.927 --> 21:35.893
Light me up,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.662
Lord of the tickets.

21:37.664 --> 21:42.700
Lieutenant roth had an offshore
bank account-- a big one.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.836
Filled up primarily by--
wait for it--

21:45.838 --> 21:47.838
Cuban sources.
Mcgee:
As a navy

21:47.840 --> 21:49.874
Officer, that's a violation
of at least seven laws.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.576
Yes, it is, mcgee, but how do
we know he's a navy officer?

21:52.578 --> 21:54.879
I pulled every record
I could find on roth,

21:54.881 --> 21:56.614
From his military files

21:56.616 --> 21:58.049
To his high school
library card.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.884
Seriously, that's his
high school library card.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.819
The signatures don't match.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.621
Yeah, it's close,
but no cuban cigar.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.089
See, look at the r's.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.359
Sometime, in roth's early 20s,
his signature changed,

22:08.361 --> 22:10.761
I can think of
why that would happen.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.697
Lieutenant roth is not
lieutenant roth.

22:12.699 --> 22:13.964
So then, who is he?

22:21.073 --> 22:23.074
Careful, mr. Palmer.

22:23.076 --> 22:27.745
Gastric acid can cut a hole
right through your foot.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.414
Yeah.
Hopefully, just the lock.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.616
How's it going over there?

22:32.618 --> 22:34.852
I've finished connecting
the hearing aid's microphone,

22:34.854 --> 22:37.855
And I've almost done
the earpiece.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.623
(quiet grunt)

22:39.625 --> 22:40.991
Ah, got it.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.595
(whispering):
Testing, one, two, three.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.863
(whispering):
Crystal clear.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.766
Slice open
the ileocecal junction.

22:48.768 --> 22:52.069
We don't want anyone
walking in here.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.109
Can you hear them?

22:58.111 --> 23:00.010
Yes. They're complaining
about the smell.

23:05.851 --> 23:06.951
Speaking of smell...

23:06.953 --> 23:10.488
About your idea
for the methane capture.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.923
I found an old cigarette
that we could use...

23:12.925 --> 23:15.826
Wait-- they're talking
about lieutenant roth.

23:15.828 --> 23:19.530
He was supposed to deliver
a package to our captors.

23:19.532 --> 23:22.833
They think
whoever shot him may have it.

23:22.835 --> 23:26.704
Oh, I wonder what was in that.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.472
Wonder if agent gibbs
has realized

23:28.474 --> 23:30.074
That we're even missing yet.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.609
Not that it matters.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.944
I mean, he is never
going to find us. There's...

23:33.946 --> 23:35.179
Mr. Palmer,

23:35.181 --> 23:37.415
If you can be certain
of one thing,

23:37.417 --> 23:39.550
It is that agent gibbs...

23:40.853 --> 23:44.121
Shh, shh, shh.
They're talking about us.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.191
Okay, if it's bad,
just don't tell me.

23:51.997 --> 23:54.632
Okay, changed my mind.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.934
Our captor is telling
her associates

23:56.936 --> 24:00.171
To bury lieutenant roth when
we're finished with the autopsy.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.906
That's not so bad.

24:01.908 --> 24:06.177
But, apparently,
we are to join him.

24:06.179 --> 24:09.013
That is bad.

24:09.015 --> 24:13.551
If we're going to make a
move, it better be soon.

24:15.887 --> 24:17.521
I used facial-recognition
software

24:17.523 --> 24:19.557
To compare old pictures
of lieutenant roth

24:19.559 --> 24:21.125
With his most
recent service photos.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.893
Definitely not the same guy.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.462
Could have fooled me.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.996
Yeah, he fooled everybody.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.865
And now, ducky and
jimmy are missing.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.099
But you're going
to find them, right?

24:29.101 --> 24:31.001
Yeah, we're going to find them.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.903
No I.D. Out on
who's impersonating roth.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.905
But, by analyzing every photo
I could find,

24:34.907 --> 24:37.875
I was able to narrow down
the date of the switch.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.711
The person that showed up at the
naval academy on induction day--

24:40.713 --> 24:44.915
The person who showed up
to the candidate guidance office

24:44.917 --> 24:47.218
For final interview two weeks
earlier-- that was the original.

24:47.220 --> 24:48.886
The impostor
made the switch

24:48.888 --> 24:50.054
Some time in between.

24:50.056 --> 24:52.056
Roth's induction was
ten years ago, boss.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.992
Abby:
I finished examining
fake roth's computer.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.994
He's been using his
c.O.'s access codes

24:56.996 --> 24:59.997
To download some seriously
classified material,

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
Once a month, like clockwork,
for years.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.902
So you add a giant piggy bank
filled with cuban cash...

25:04.904 --> 25:06.904
We got a mole.
Deep cover.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.639
So he found a guy
who looked just like him,

25:08.641 --> 25:10.574
Who was getting ready to
join the navy, but he waited

25:10.576 --> 25:11.942
Until that guy passed all
his navy background checks.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.744
Then stepped right
into his shoes.
He's a loner

25:13.746 --> 25:15.546
With no family.

25:15.548 --> 25:17.515
Who's gonna notice?
We did.

25:17.517 --> 25:20.251
Do you think that
real roth is dead?

25:20.253 --> 25:22.286
He's dead as a doornail.

25:22.288 --> 25:25.823
What I want to know is, who
shot the impostor this morning?

25:25.825 --> 25:27.091
We find him, we find ducky.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.294
What?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.830
I found him... I think.

25:32.832 --> 25:33.964
I found a second
person's blood

25:33.966 --> 25:35.165
At the crime scene.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.034
He was former navy.
I got an I.D.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.770
Lieutenant michael dunkel.

25:45.944 --> 25:48.178
Remember where
you need to be.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.180
Yes, doctor.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.850
Good. Your life
will depend upon it.

25:52.852 --> 25:56.921
I estimate we have less than
two minutes to showtime.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.556
Doctor, doctor...

25:59.958 --> 26:03.994
In case your plan-- as brilliant
as it is-- doesn't work...

26:03.996 --> 26:05.996
Likewise, mister...

26:05.998 --> 26:07.932
Jimmy.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.238
Shall we?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.140
Yeah.

26:16.142 --> 26:19.710
I pulled that bullet from
lieutenant roth's pelvic bone.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.947
The angle of entry suggests that
the wound was self-inflicted.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.081
He shot himself?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.583
Well, I doubt on purpose.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.017
I usually see wounds like this

26:27.019 --> 26:29.019
When the victim
is struggling

26:29.021 --> 26:30.754
To control his weapon.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.023
Lieutenant roth's attacker was
probably trying to disarm him.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.659
Which, by itself,
may not mean much, but

26:35.661 --> 26:38.062
If you could recover
roth's gun...

26:38.064 --> 26:40.664
We found it
when we searched the area.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.700
His attacker's prints
may be on this.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.603
Perhaps he has whatever it is
you're looking for.

26:45.605 --> 26:49.106
See? Told you
keeping them alive was worth it.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.042
Even the whiner.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.244
So, does that mean we can kill
them now and get out of here?

26:54.246 --> 26:57.147
I haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.949
They're all yours.

26:58.951 --> 26:59.950
Did-did you really think

26:59.952 --> 27:04.822
Everything without leaving
ourselves some insurance?

27:04.824 --> 27:08.158
We did find
something else.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.395
Which makes identifying
the attacker moot,

27:11.397 --> 27:14.999
Assuming that, uh, his
prints are even on record.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.133
What?

27:16.135 --> 27:18.135
Well...

27:18.137 --> 27:22.106
Take us somewhere public,
and I'll tell you.

27:22.108 --> 27:26.176
Or I could just shoot
your little friend in the face.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.278
Then you'd better
shoot me, as well.

27:41.259 --> 27:44.194
Could you be more obvious?

27:44.196 --> 27:45.763
Oh, mr. Palmer!

27:45.765 --> 27:47.364
(scoffs)

27:47.366 --> 27:49.166
Sorry.

27:52.937 --> 27:54.738
Where did you get this?

27:54.740 --> 27:55.806
Mm.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.207
Where?!

27:57.209 --> 27:58.242
Lieutenant roth swallowed it!

27:58.244 --> 27:59.743
(sighs)

27:59.745 --> 28:03.347
It's a locker key
from a bus stop or gym, maybe.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.349
Jimmy:
Yeah, it's got to be

28:05.351 --> 28:06.417
Pretty important, too,
especially because...

28:06.419 --> 28:07.351
Mr. Palmer!

28:07.353 --> 28:08.919
(gasps)

28:08.921 --> 28:11.722
Talk.
(grunts)

28:11.724 --> 28:13.290
Uh, um...

28:13.292 --> 28:16.193
We found... The... Key

28:16.195 --> 28:18.195
Lodged in the small intestine,

28:18.197 --> 28:20.197
Which was spewing
decomposition gases,

28:20.199 --> 28:21.765
Much like...

28:21.767 --> 28:27.137
Seal a... A piece of intestine
inside of a surgical glove.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.239
It would slowly begin
to inflate with methane,

28:29.241 --> 28:30.474
Like, l-like a balloon.

28:30.476 --> 28:33.143
And now-now, methane
is-is highly flammable,

28:33.145 --> 28:35.212
But, uh, if you combine it
with an oxidizer,

28:35.214 --> 28:37.081
Like the...
Like the sodium hydroxide found

28:37.083 --> 28:38.916
In the drain cleaner
in the victim's lungs,

28:38.918 --> 28:40.084
Then suddenly,

28:40.086 --> 28:41.218
It's explosive.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.020
If we add to that
a heat source...

28:43.022 --> 28:44.188
You're stalling.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.223
Yes, he is.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.792
The cigarette is taking
longer than we thought

28:48.794 --> 28:51.495
To ignite the
gauze in the oven.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.268
(grunting)

28:58.270 --> 28:59.770
Marcus?
(groaning)

28:59.772 --> 29:01.371
(coughing)
man:
Marcus?

29:01.373 --> 29:03.240
Marcus?
Oh, my god!

29:03.242 --> 29:04.208
Marcus.
(groans)

29:04.210 --> 29:05.375
Okay, put him out!

29:05.377 --> 29:07.177
(groaning)

29:07.179 --> 29:09.012
(coughing)
(groaning)

29:09.014 --> 29:10.314
Put him out!

29:10.316 --> 29:12.382
(grunting)

29:14.085 --> 29:15.252
(both panting)

29:15.254 --> 29:17.354
(coughs)

29:17.356 --> 29:19.223
He's dead.

29:21.392 --> 29:23.193
Woman:
They're gone.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.962
(groans)

29:31.870 --> 29:33.370
Dunkel:
Yeah, that's a...

29:33.372 --> 29:35.372
This can't be my blood.

29:35.374 --> 29:39.042
And, uh, I'm sorry.
I don't recognize this man.

29:39.044 --> 29:41.278
Maybe that black eye's
affecting your vision.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.147
How about that?

29:45.116 --> 29:47.017
Oh, my god, what,
uh... What happened?

29:47.019 --> 29:48.285
You tell me.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.020
Make it quick.
Yeah, I know.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.922
I did tell you.
I-I don't know him.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.924
We got your dna
at the crime scene.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.260
He had your blood on him.
You know what else he had?

29:56.262 --> 29:58.028
A bank account
funded by the cubans.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.863
I-I don't know
anything about that.

29:59.865 --> 30:01.398
And a computer full
of classified material.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.499
Just-just wait.
Wait a second.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.867
You're going down,

30:03.869 --> 30:05.135
And you're going down
hard for treason,

30:05.137 --> 30:07.171
Unless you start talking!
Whoa, treason?!

30:07.173 --> 30:09.139
Look, I've got
two guys missing!

30:09.141 --> 30:11.809
I don't have time for this!
I want answers! Now!

30:11.811 --> 30:13.944
Right now!

30:15.947 --> 30:18.482
Going once, going...

30:18.484 --> 30:21.218
The answer is, he was
sleeping with my wife!

30:21.220 --> 30:22.419
What?

30:22.421 --> 30:24.121
My wife--

30:24.123 --> 30:26.390
Lieutenant roth
was sleeping with her.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.192
Commander lisa cleveland.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.359
Your name is dunkel.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.527
Yeah, she wouldn't
take my name.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.196
Who does that, huh?

30:32.198 --> 30:33.330
Everybody these days,
that's who.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.065
No one cares
about tradition.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.401
She certainly didn't care
about our marriage vows.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.502
Geez.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.404
All right, let me hear it.

30:40.406 --> 30:41.905
Make it quick.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.874
I found out roth was
sleeping with lisa,

30:43.876 --> 30:45.342
So I-I went to
confront him.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.476
It got physical.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.345
I didn't want it to,
but he started it.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.513
Then he pulled a gun.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.416
And-and we struggled,
and the gun went off.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.385
As fast as I could,
and I didn't look back.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.888
Look, I didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.389
He attacked me.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.124
I'm the victim.

31:01.126 --> 31:03.060
The only thing
I know about this guy is-is...

31:03.062 --> 31:06.864
I don't... I don't know anything
about any classified material,

31:06.866 --> 31:08.332
Or your-your missing men.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.400
I'm sorry about that,
but I don't.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.412
(ducky and jimmy panting)

31:29.220 --> 31:32.289
Doctor...

31:32.291 --> 31:35.459
I need a... I need moment
to catch my breath.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.361
We don't have a moment,
mr. Palmer.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.396
Have you been hitting
the gym or something?

31:39.398 --> 31:40.964
Cardio-rehab.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.399
We can talk
about that later.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.168
Listen, our captors
undoubtedly know

31:45.170 --> 31:48.071
That we are... We are heading
for the... The highway.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.907
Perhaps, with this moonlight,

31:49.909 --> 31:54.912
We might be better off with
stealth instead of speed.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.513
That works for me.

31:56.515 --> 32:00.017
Ziva, lieutenant roth's c.O.
Confirm the affair?

32:00.019 --> 32:01.919
Actually, she denied it,
until I told her

32:01.921 --> 32:04.187
Roth was only sleeping with her
to get her access codes.

32:04.189 --> 32:05.322
We tracked down a new witness

32:05.324 --> 32:06.490
Who saw roth
and the husband fight.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.425
Hubby was telling the truth.
Yeah, I know.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.526
Kind of hoping he was lying.

32:09.528 --> 32:13.497
Chose a really bad time
to confront his wife's lover.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.966
Those pictures that roth
took in the park...

32:15.968 --> 32:18.101
He appears to be surveilling
an area in advance

32:18.103 --> 32:19.636
Of some kind of meeting.
As he is a spy,

32:19.638 --> 32:22.105
Probably with his handlers.
Mcgee:
Wanted to make sure

32:22.107 --> 32:23.607
He wasn't followed
by the authorities.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.609
Except he was being followed
by a jealous husband.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.443
Ziva:
When the police got involved,

32:26.445 --> 32:27.678
He had no choice

32:27.680 --> 32:29.146
But to terminate the op.
You mean kill himself.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.982
Had he allowed himself
to be captured,

32:31.984 --> 32:33.450
It was only
a matter of time

32:33.452 --> 32:35.185
Before he gave up
his entire operation.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.720
He was protecting his team.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.722
Roth's handlers must be
the ones who took the body.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.390
That means ducky and jimmy, too.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.226
Gibbs:
Okay, okay.

32:43.228 --> 32:46.563
On the side of the road
where the m.E. Van was stopped.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.198
Bolo on the suv
that was tailing it.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.100
And footprints as well.
Hopefully abby has made

32:50.102 --> 32:51.201
Some progress analyzing them.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.135
Go. Find out.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.270
Mcgee, go.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.406
(ducky and jimmy panting)

32:56.408 --> 32:58.175
(gunshot in distance)

32:58.177 --> 32:59.476
What was that?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.278
Presumably our captors.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.013
(two gunshots in distance)

33:03.015 --> 33:04.081
Looking for us,

33:04.083 --> 33:05.749
Shooting at anything
that moves.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.751
In case we get killed
before I get a chance to say it,

33:07.753 --> 33:10.287
Your plan worked
brilliantly, doctor.
Yes.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.522
Despite the fact that
you started telling
our captors the plan.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.458
What did you...
You told me that my job

33:14.460 --> 33:16.259
Was to stall them
until the combustion started,

33:16.261 --> 33:18.261
So I just started saying the
first thing that came to mind,

33:18.263 --> 33:21.198
Which was-- surprise, surprise--
the ticking bomb six feet away.

33:21.200 --> 33:25.402
But if we're gonna survive,
we are going to need a new plan.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.371
Well, you told me
that gibbs would find the cabin.

33:27.373 --> 33:30.574
And we can assume that
he's gonna find the message

33:30.576 --> 33:32.509
That we left, but
we can't assume

33:32.511 --> 33:34.478
That he's gonna
find it in time.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.247
Well, then it's a good thing
that I grabbed this.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.215
Whoa!

33:38.217 --> 33:39.716
Huh.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.753
One of them... Dropped it
in the blast.

33:44.522 --> 33:49.059
I would rather take a stand
than get shot in the back.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.362
Likewise. Only I'm...

33:52.364 --> 33:53.530
Not too keen to get

33:53.532 --> 33:55.599
In a firefight
with professional killers.

33:55.601 --> 33:56.433
Neither am I.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.435
All right. Come on.

33:58.437 --> 34:03.373
On the suv-- a ranger
at shenandoah national forest

34:03.375 --> 34:05.375
Logged a vehicle
matching our description

34:05.377 --> 34:07.377
Entering the park
for two weeks.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.379
The occupants registered
to use a hunting cabin.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.580
Ranger remembered
'cause they asked

34:10.582 --> 34:12.282
For the most isolated
cabin they had.

34:13.584 --> 34:15.285
Dinozzo.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.387
Running the plates, boss.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.722
But, boss, I usually...

34:19.524 --> 34:21.458
Okay, that's fine.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.094
Tony: Suv's registered
to a shell company

34:24.096 --> 34:25.162
Out of richmond...

34:29.600 --> 34:32.069
Boss, it uses the same bank that
funded roth's offshore account.

34:39.477 --> 34:41.545
Jimmy: Haven't heard anything
in a while.

34:41.547 --> 34:44.614
More likely, they
also opted for stealth.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.450
Means they could
be anywhere.
Yeah.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.484
Oh, my god.

34:47.486 --> 34:48.485
(gasps)

34:48.487 --> 34:52.389
I just realized that I missed my
nine-month wedding anniversary.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.523
Breena is gonna kill me.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.626
You do know I have
a heart condition.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.462
What? Oh,
I'm so sorry...

34:58.464 --> 35:00.664
No, I understand, mr. Palmer.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.333
Nothing is more important
than the ones we love,

35:03.335 --> 35:05.802
Felt most keenly at times
like this. In fact...

35:05.804 --> 35:07.571
(gasps, groans)

35:07.573 --> 35:09.739
Are you all right?

35:09.741 --> 35:11.441
Yes, I'm all right.
(groans)

35:11.443 --> 35:12.642
Oh, no, no, no, no.

35:12.644 --> 35:13.643
Not the ankle.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.312
Oh, it's always
the ankle.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.380
Yes, it's always
the ankle.

35:17.382 --> 35:20.450
23,000 people sprain
their ankles every day

35:20.452 --> 35:22.686
Without walking in the forest
in the pitch dark.

35:22.688 --> 35:25.288
(gunshot in distance)

35:27.358 --> 35:29.426
Okay. Okay.
It's okay.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.761
It's fine. I
will carry you.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.797
(grunts in pain)
now, m-mr. Palmer,

35:33.799 --> 35:36.166
Yeah?
Even if I could stomach
the ignominy,

35:36.168 --> 35:38.235
You wouldn't get very far.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.770
No. Y-you have to go on
without me.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.506
N-n-no, I'm not leaving you.

35:42.508 --> 35:46.176
Y-you're not leaving me.
We're just... Splitting up.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.145
Doctor, I respect you more
than anyone in the world.

35:48.147 --> 35:50.147
So please forgive me
when I say...

35:50.149 --> 35:52.315
Go to hell.
I'm not leaving you.

35:52.317 --> 35:57.654
Mr. Palmer, if we both stay,
we may both go to hell.

35:57.656 --> 36:01.191
I think it's time
we made our stand.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.195
Oh... Right.

36:13.938 --> 36:15.772
Ziva: How many rangers
do you have?

36:15.774 --> 36:18.508
Mcgee: Straight down this road
another thousand feet, boss.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.677
Well, wake them up.
I need blockades on every road
in and out of the park.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.180
Ziva: I don't care
what time it is.
Reports every ten minutes.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.781
Okay.

36:33.791 --> 36:35.859
Okay.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.364
Jimmy:
<i>What's the plan?</i>

36:41.366 --> 36:44.634
Well, we-we sit here
and wait for them to find us.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.671
We don't have time to strategize
any more than that.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.673
(groans)
give me the gun.

36:49.675 --> 36:50.907
Fine by me.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.776
Wait. Why?

36:52.778 --> 36:55.779
Because I have military
firearms training.

36:55.781 --> 36:56.846
With a musket.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.583
Doctor, that was
50 years ago.

36:59.585 --> 37:00.917
It's better than your none.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.286
I will have you know, I
have prestiged six times

37:03.288 --> 37:04.287
In <i>black ops 2.</i>

37:04.289 --> 37:05.789
Do I even want to know?

37:05.791 --> 37:08.458
Doctor, it's not like
I want the gun, okay?

37:08.460 --> 37:10.260
It's just that it's
very dark out and...

37:10.262 --> 37:12.629
Frankly, your eyesight is
not what it used to be.

37:12.631 --> 37:13.797
I beg your pardon.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.632
I knew that was not
gonna land well.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.735
And I may have to ask you
to leave again.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.671
Actually, doctor...

37:23.841 --> 37:25.609
...Maybe that's exactly
what I should do.

37:28.379 --> 37:29.746
Gibbs:
Ncis!

37:29.748 --> 37:31.514
Hands in the air!

37:47.832 --> 37:49.833
Clear.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.801
I think it's safe to assume
ducky and jimmy were here.

37:51.803 --> 37:52.969
And did some damage.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.005
Gibbs:
Yeah, but where are they now?

37:57.475 --> 38:01.044
Come on, ducky,
talk to me.

38:04.749 --> 38:06.950
Gibbs:
Right here.

38:07.918 --> 38:09.586
"r9"?
Rule nine.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.954
Never go anywhere
without a knife.

38:20.331 --> 38:21.831
Not anywhere.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.400
Right there.

38:24.869 --> 38:26.803
That way. Come on!

38:26.805 --> 38:29.606
Let's go.

38:29.608 --> 38:32.475
Ducky (panting):
Mr. Palmer!

38:32.477 --> 38:35.478
Where are you?

38:35.480 --> 38:41.318
I-I'm sorry I-I questioned
your ability with firearms.

38:41.320 --> 38:46.389
Prestiging six times with <i>black</i>
<i>ops 2</i> is ample experience.

38:46.391 --> 38:50.660
Six times...
Isn't bad.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.796
But I prestiged seven.

38:52.798 --> 38:53.863
Oh, my god.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.866
Call your buddy.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.034
Well, I don't know
if you've noticed,

38:58.036 --> 38:59.336
But I have been calling him.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.104
He... He isn't answering.

39:01.106 --> 39:04.908
Maybe he'll answer
when he hears you screaming.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.543
Oh. No.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.411
No.

39:08.413 --> 39:09.813
No, no.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.815
You shouldn't have
killed marcus.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.817
Good-bye, doctor.

39:13.819 --> 39:16.519
(jimmy yelling)

39:18.889 --> 39:20.523
(gun clicking empty)

39:20.525 --> 39:22.492
(jimmy grunting, panting)

39:22.494 --> 39:25.528
(gun continues clicking)

39:25.530 --> 39:28.865
You can stop shooting,
mr. Palmer.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.000
Oh, my god, I
got him! I g...

39:31.002 --> 39:32.836
(ducky chuckling)

39:32.838 --> 39:34.904
I got him.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.041
(jimmy panting)

39:40.946 --> 39:43.580
I thought I'd feel
relieved, but...

39:43.582 --> 39:45.415
This feels much,
much worse.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.016
This...

39:48.018 --> 39:50.987
I've never...
I've never...

39:52.957 --> 39:54.090
(grunting)

39:54.959 --> 39:56.393
You still haven't...

39:56.395 --> 39:58.962
Run, mr. Palmer,
while you can!

39:58.964 --> 40:00.063
(grunts)

40:00.065 --> 40:02.632
No, no. I'm not
leaving you.

40:02.634 --> 40:06.035
Doctor, I thought
I got him.

40:06.037 --> 40:09.439
(grunts, panting)

40:13.010 --> 40:15.912
Fine by me.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.448
I should've given
you the gun.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.453
Mcgee:
Ncis! Hands up!
What?

40:23.455 --> 40:24.654
Don't move!

40:24.656 --> 40:26.122
Okay, hold on, hold on.

40:34.632 --> 40:36.132
Oh, this feels very, very good.

40:36.134 --> 40:36.933
Drop it!

40:36.935 --> 40:39.702
Okay, okay, okay.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.004
You two okay?

40:41.006 --> 40:44.107
We've been cleaner.

40:45.042 --> 40:46.142
Tony:
Nice to see you guys.

40:46.144 --> 40:47.143
What did we miss?
I'd rather not

40:47.145 --> 40:48.211
Talk about it
right now, tony.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.046
I'll... Probably
start crying again.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.482
Jethro, there's another one--
a woman.

40:52.484 --> 40:53.850
You'll never find her.

40:53.852 --> 40:54.884
Really?

40:54.886 --> 40:57.086
Wouldn't be so sure about that.

40:58.656 --> 41:00.723
(grunting, panting)

41:04.028 --> 41:06.095
♪

41:38.729 --> 41:40.797
Gibbs:
Looking for this?

41:42.766 --> 41:46.069
It's the usb drive your mole
wedged in the sewer drain.

41:46.071 --> 41:48.104
Our agents pulled
it out this morning.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.138
Ducky:
Did we forget to mention

41:49.140 --> 41:50.974
That we found sewage

41:50.976 --> 41:53.142
Beneath lieutenant roth's
fingernails?

41:54.178 --> 41:56.045
Sorry about that.
Ziva:
You're under arrest

41:56.047 --> 41:57.714
For espionage.
Hands behind your back.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.048
But how...?

41:59.050 --> 42:00.850
That's my locker.
And this...

42:02.152 --> 42:03.853
...This is my key.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.055
I'll be taking that.

42:06.057 --> 42:08.224
Thank you.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.294
You've been played.
