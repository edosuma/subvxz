WEBVTT

01:20.581 --> 01:22.917
Sorry. No deliveries after 5:00.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.335
Give me a break, will you?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.671
I was stacked up for hours on the I-17.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.631
What am I gonna do with these isotopes?

01:29.632 --> 01:31.550
Okay. Loading dock five.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.553
Thanks.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.618
You've got two minutes.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.538
Keep the engine running.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.153
The R12 thermal bomb.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.363
That'll keep you toasty
on a cold winter night.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.206
Hurry.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.005
I believe
that's government property.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.494
Didn't even break a sweat.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.031
Get up, let's go.

04:17.633 --> 04:20.261
I know, I know. I screwed up big time.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.429
OW!

04:21.595 --> 04:23.264
This will keep the swelling down.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.743
You're thinking,
"How could he let Kobra get away

04:26.767 --> 04:29.019
with a bomb that can incinerate
half the East Side?"

04:29.103 --> 04:31.397
Because I'm a hopeless loser,
that's why.

04:32.815 --> 04:36.277
Actually, I was thinking
you should meet an old friend of mine.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.027
Who?

04:49.415 --> 04:52.209
Fresh fishy. Best in Gotham.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.044
Get your fresh fishy.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.212
Excuse me.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.591
I'm looking for Kairi Tanaga.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.385
You want halibut? Caught fresh today.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.345
Uh, no, thanks.

05:03.429 --> 05:04.889
Maybe rock cod.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.183
I give you good price.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.851
Look, I don't need fish.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.060
Bruce Wayne sent me.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.436
Ah.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.773
What you want in back. Follow me.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.620
Wait here.

05:40.633 --> 05:41.759
Hyah!

05:50.142 --> 05:51.142
Enough.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.070
Bruce was right.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.864
You've got the moves, kid,
but you lack discipline.

06:03.948 --> 06:06.075
And you leave yourself open
on the left side.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.367
Ow.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.744
We'll have to work on that.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.038
Who are you?

06:11.997 --> 06:13.165
Kairi Tanaga.

06:13.874 --> 06:17.294
Years ago, Bruce and I
studied together under the same sensei.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.796
Now, I run this dojo.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.631
What happened to your accent?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.091
It helps sell fish.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.390
This is where we train.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.433
Zander is one of my advance students.

06:41.277 --> 06:42.528
Not bad.

06:42.611 --> 06:43.821
Can you teach me?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.699
Only if you'll follow my directions
without question.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.831
- Eel juice?
- Yeah.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.708
And brown rice and tofu.

06:55.874 --> 06:56.709
Mmm.

06:56.792 --> 06:57.710
Tasty.

06:57.793 --> 07:01.088
Bruce is sending me to this old guru
to brush up on my martial arts.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.256
Schway.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.258
You know, I could use
some new moves myself.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.677
Ha! Hyah!

07:07.511 --> 07:08.929
You think this new guru could...

07:11.849 --> 07:13.058
Never mind.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.153
Keep your chin up.
It's all about balance.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.670
- No fair.
- Fair?

07:41.754 --> 07:44.131
The only fair around here
is in September.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.549
Deal With it.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.941
Hey, Zander. Good workout.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.151
Stand aside.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.581
Who died and made him king of the world?

08:21.627 --> 08:23.754
<i>So how are the lessons going?</i>

08:23.837 --> 08:26.256
Fine, if you're into constant ridicule
and humiliation.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.966
<i>I don't think I'm ever gonna get it.</i>

08:28.050 --> 08:29.301
Pafience.

08:29.385 --> 08:31.011
Any leads on that bomb yet?

08:31.303 --> 08:32.888
Hey!

08:32.971 --> 08:34.515
Are you okay?

08:35.391 --> 08:36.558
No time left.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.185
No time for any of us.

09:00.416 --> 09:01.416
There.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.678
No!

09:15.723 --> 09:16.723
Search him.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.147
That's it. Let's go.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.208
A thermal bomb I can understand,

09:43.292 --> 09:45.961
but since when is Kobra
into street muggings?

09:46.044 --> 09:48.380
Obviously,
he had something they wanted.

09:48.464 --> 09:51.425
The police identified him
as Dr. Padu Banjahri.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.595
He's a paleontologist
at the Natural History Museum.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.388
Maybe it's time for afield trip.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.061
Terry.

10:03.645 --> 10:04.730
Look.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.317
Isn't she adorable?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.000
They're always cute when they're little.

10:14.698 --> 10:15.699
Come on.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.578
[announced
<i>B y jealously protecting their</i> young,

10:19.661 --> 10:23.081
<i>these carnivores thrived
in the primordial subtropical heat,</i>

10:23.165 --> 10:25.584
<i>and ruled the world
for millions of years.</i>

10:25.667 --> 10:27.753
Way schway display.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.934
Dr. Banjahri's office
should be down this way.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.519
Hey, what are you doing here?

10:43.811 --> 10:45.437
Uh, just admiring your work.

10:45.521 --> 10:47.439
A Pachycephalosaurus, isn't it?

10:47.606 --> 10:48.690
Why, yes. How did you know?

10:48.774 --> 10:51.276
I'm into fossils. Nice femur.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.444
Where'd you find it?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.491
Actually, it's a rather
fascinating story.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.451
I was lookin' for an Iguanodon
in Wyoming

10:59.535 --> 11:02.120
when I noticed this striated ridge
just off to the west.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.204
Really?

11:03.247 --> 11:04.247
Somehow, I had a hunch

11:04.289 --> 11:05.767
I might find
something interesting there,

11:05.791 --> 11:07.167
so I started digging.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.722
- I'm in.
- What was Banjahri working on?

11:20.806 --> 11:22.558
One sec. I'm checkin' his files.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.062
Got it. Whoa.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.689
Interesting.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.108
I think he was recovering
ancient dinosaur DNA.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.903
DNA and thermal bombs?

11:34.987 --> 11:36.238
What's the connection?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.331
Still not right, McGinnis.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.166
Take a dinner break,
then we'll try again.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.177
What, no strong-arm goons tonight?

11:59.553 --> 12:00.429
Sorry.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.015
Sometimes my guardians
can be overprotective.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.058
- Rice cake?
- Thanks.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.356
What I wouldn't give
for a nice greasy slice of pizza.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.359
Pizza? Mmm, I've heard of it.

12:14.443 --> 12:15.819
You're kidding, right?

12:15.903 --> 12:17.279
I'm afraid not.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.740
That's criminal. Everybody loves pizza.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.491
My life is different.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.077
Ever since I was born,
I've been groomed to lead my people.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.871
You mean, like a prince?

12:25.954 --> 12:27.205
Sort of.

12:27.289 --> 12:30.129
That's no reason to deny yourself
one of the greatest pleasures in life.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.021
How are you gonna be an effective leader
if you've never even eaten pizza?

12:33.045 --> 12:34.254
What do you suggest?

12:44.222 --> 12:45.098
So here's the plan.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.017
We go in, grab a slice and get out.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.186
No one will ever know
we were gone, right?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.395
What are they doing?

12:50.479 --> 12:52.105
Playing vid games.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.024
- Wanna try?
- Yes.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.692
<i>Hey, Tet, who's your Mend?</i>

12:56.193 --> 12:58.862
Max, this is Zander.
He's a total newbie.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.826
Wanna show him some levels
while I snag a pizza?

13:02.366 --> 13:04.868
Today you will become a man, my son.

13:04.952 --> 13:05.952
What?

13:25.639 --> 13:26.473
Ha.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.556
Gotcha.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.184
Wanna bet?

13:32.729 --> 13:33.729
What?

13:40.904 --> 13:41.989
Game over.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.201
Who's bad? Who's rad?

13:46.284 --> 13:47.953
Who's never been had?

13:48.036 --> 13:49.036
Whoo!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.456
But I never lose.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.959
There's a first time
for everything, sport.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.419
You don't understand.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.254
Icanfilose.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.632
It's just a game, Zandy.
Get over it.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.050
Besides, the pizza's here.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.556
All right. But then we play again.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.391
It's your funeral.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.478
- Is she always like this?
- Afraid so.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.149
I don't remember ordering
bacon on my pizza.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.567
Oh, no.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.152
And where's the double pepperoni?

14:20.235 --> 14:21.820
That's ours.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.697
Is it? Oh, silly me.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.073
Give the man his pizza.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.750
Easy, Zander.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.436
And just to show
there's no hard feelings,

14:36.460 --> 14:38.420
we'll even help you clean up.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.929
What's your hurry, pizza puss?

14:48.764 --> 14:49.764
Whoa!

14:50.849 --> 14:51.975
Get him.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.238
Not funny, man.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.242
Wait.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.374
I'll show you funny.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.668
Stop, you'll kill him!

15:22.714 --> 15:24.091
I was handling them.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.884
That's not the point.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.178
You left the dojo without an escort.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.013
How could you have taken such a risk?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.389
It was my idea.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.183
You will come with us immediately.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.935
Do you understand?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.018
Yes.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.397
Wait a second.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.149
This doesn't concern you.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.628
Where's Zander?

16:02.754 --> 16:04.256
He won't be coming to class anymore.

16:05.799 --> 16:06.799
Why?

16:07.342 --> 16:10.929
His guardians felt my supervision
was somewhat negligent.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.849
I'm sorry.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.433
Don't sweat it.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.395
There wasn't much more
I could have done for him, anyway.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.647
His path was already chosen for him.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.091
[Unhafing]

16:55.390 --> 16:57.517
- Hail Kobra.
- Hail Kobra.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.523
Aren't they ready yet?

17:03.899 --> 17:05.233
A leader must learn patience.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.319
Don't lecture me.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.155
I assure you
the preparations are nearly complete.

17:10.447 --> 17:11.448
You see.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.422
How much more time do we have?

17:27.505 --> 17:30.008
There's one last thing I want to do.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.885
I can't imagine what that would be.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.095
I've anticipated your every need.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.097
Have you, Doctor?

17:37.474 --> 17:38.850
Maybe it's for the best, you know?

17:38.934 --> 17:40.894
I got kind of a weird vibe
from that guy.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.230
Yeah,
but I still feel bad about it.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.481
Like it's all my fault.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.011
Don't let it keep you up nights.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.651
<i>Max, get off the line.</i>

17:48.610 --> 17:50.278
Some of us have work to do.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.571
Ouch.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.366
Well, excuse me for living.

18:06.628 --> 18:07.628
Max.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.508
Zander? Here for a rematch?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.343
Come with me. Now.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.845
Look, now's not a good time.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.806
I got a bio final tomorrow,
and I gotta study.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.432
I said now.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.478
Uh-huh... I appreciate
the interest, really.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.313
But I'll call you, okay?

18:27.065 --> 18:28.191
Wow.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.613
I won't be ignored.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.032
Stay back.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.089
Terry.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.092
Max, I thought I told you
to stay off this line.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.260
<i>Get away from me!</i>

18:56.845 --> 18:58.763
Terry, get over to Max's and hurry.

19:06.438 --> 19:07.564
Max?

19:20.076 --> 19:21.202
Max.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.512
Lose him.
