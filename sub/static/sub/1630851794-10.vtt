00:28.162 --> 00:29.395
[man speaking]

00:29.397 --> 00:31.030
we can push it one more day.

<i> [narrator] a new father</i>
<i>  hopes to water seeds</i>
<i>  for a future empire.</i>

00:34.835 --> 00:36.835
He better put
as much gold in there,

00:36.837 --> 00:39.638
because it's going
to blow the ice away.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.540
<i> [narrator] and a trailblazing</i>

<i>  I'm going to have</i>

<i> [narrator] where will</i>
<i>  the chips fall</i>

<i>  on the season finale</i>
<i>  of bering sea gold?</i>

00:54.188 --> 00:56.588
-[man speaking]
-this is it.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.524
Look at that nugget.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.936
<i> [narrator] it's been</i>
<i> the worst winter in 100 years.</i>

01:17.545 --> 01:21.413
<i> A relentless barrage of storms</i>
<i>  has assaulted nome.</i>

01:22.950 --> 01:26.485
<i>  Now, in less than 24 hours,</i>
<i>  the brutal season...</i>

01:28.022 --> 01:29.421
<i>  Will be history.</i>

01:30.825 --> 01:33.992
<i>  A blizzard looms</i>
<i>  less than 100 miles away.</i>

01:34.929 --> 01:37.996
<i>  With winds and downfalls</i>
<i>  so severe,</i>

01:37.998 --> 01:42.301
<i>  there is no chance</i>
<i>  the rapidly deteriorating ice</i>
<i>  will survive.</i>

01:43.838 --> 01:47.072
<i>  As most miners flee</i>

<i>  to make their golden dreams</i>
<i>  come true.</i>

02:10.898 --> 02:14.233
[vernon] so the weather report
has changed.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.768
Now, it looks like the wind
picked up some,

02:16.770 --> 02:19.238
it's going to be a toss-up,
whether or not it's workable,

02:19.240 --> 02:21.140
I'm thinking it's probably
still going to be workable.

02:21.142 --> 02:25.511
<i> [narrator] vernon adkison,</i>
<i>  currently the miner with</i>
<i>  the most gold in the fleet,</i>

02:25.513 --> 02:29.114
<i>  readies to push his luck</i>
<i>  one last time.</i>

02:29.116 --> 02:33.852
We got an open water
lead out there that's struck
down here by the nome river,

02:33.854 --> 02:35.687
and then it goes on out there.

02:35.689 --> 02:40.125
And then all the way
to the west,
as far as I can see.

02:41.228 --> 02:46.331
The ice has broken off
and drifted out to sea,
so it's encroaching on us.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.934
<i>  I knew</i>
<i>  this was too good to last.</i>

02:48.936 --> 02:53.238
Best season of my life,
but now this storm is going
to put the kibosh on it.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.842
And that lead
has been exploding
in the last day or two.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.012
More ice is breaking off
every hour.

03:00.014 --> 03:04.650
With this wind bearing
down on us, we're playing
russian roulette for sure.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.218
[speaking]

03:16.797 --> 03:19.064
<i> [vernon] you never</i>
<i>  can tell what the damn ice</i>
<i>  will do.</i>

03:19.066 --> 03:23.168
I'm thinking,
I'm always knocking on wood.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.705
<i>  Most people would</i>
<i>  run for cover</i>

<i>  but I'm on</i>
<i>  the best gold of my life.</i>

03:29.009 --> 03:32.044
I'm going for 200 ounces
this season.

03:32.046 --> 03:32.978
Let's dive.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.079
Yeah. Let's dive.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.082
This is our last
chance to grab the good stuff.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.884
There's no way
we're sitting it out.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.952
You're ready to go get it?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.553
Going to get it. Yeah.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.955
All right.
That's your last chance.

03:42.957 --> 03:44.089
Yeah.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.591
<i> [narrator] 12 miles west...</i>

03:49.363 --> 03:52.030

got a storm brewing,

03:54.835 --> 03:55.934
that's coming,

03:55.936 --> 03:58.103
but we still want
to keep going.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.138
<i> [narrator] in the final hours</i>

Hey joe!

04:09.283 --> 04:11.083
[joe speaking]

04:11.085 --> 04:12.851
but we're going
to get that gold, hey?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.686
[shawn] hmmm-hmm.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.622
<i>  Last chance at greatness.</i>

04:16.624 --> 04:20.726
We've been searching for this
jackpot all winter long.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.662
<i>  Last time out, we were on</i>
<i>  the hottest gold thus far.</i>

04:23.664 --> 04:25.030
<i>  We're definitely at the cusp,</i>

04:25.032 --> 04:27.866
<i>  but we're not</i>
<i>  at the epicenter yet.</i>

04:27.868 --> 04:30.235
Today, we should be able
to find the last three ounces

04:30.237 --> 04:32.271
I need to make up my payments.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.107
But that's not all I'm after,
I want the motherlode.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.209
I want the stuff of legend.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.912
We're going to hop
in this hole
and see what's here?

04:40.914 --> 04:43.115
Might be a pile of gold
down there.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.218
<i> [shawn] gold's going</i>
<i>  to go down first</i>

04:46.220 --> 04:48.553
<i>  and then I'll go down</i>
<i>  and finish this hole off.</i>

04:48.555 --> 04:51.957
Storm's going to bear down
on us fast,
so I got to be tight.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.359
I want to get off the flicks
and get into the nuggets.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.261
[shawn speaking]

05:14.281 --> 05:15.547
[gary speaking]

05:20.220 --> 05:21.920
okay, gary,

05:21.922 --> 05:24.923
why don't you try to give me
an assessment

05:24.925 --> 05:27.993
on how much ground you think
we've got to work?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.996
[gary speaking]

05:34.301 --> 05:36.101
I don't know. You tell me.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.071
[gary speaking]

05:44.044 --> 05:46.878
it's, I mean,
pitch blackness down there.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.248
[gary speaking]

05:52.720 --> 05:54.252
so he's trying
to figure out...

05:55.055 --> 05:57.622
What's been cleaned out
and what hasn't.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.192
He's working
in pitch blackness own there,

06:00.194 --> 06:03.261
except for what he sees
with his light
right in front of him.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.998
It's like
looking through a tunnel.

[shawn speaking]

08:31.979 --> 08:33.178
tap the floor.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.884
This is not it.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.552
Last day, last chance.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.420
<i>  This ain't it.</i>

08:43.123 --> 08:44.723
Look, we'll have a good day.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.825
Bills will get paid.

08:46.827 --> 08:50.829
<i>  But looking for that jackpot,</i>
<i>  all winter long</i>
<i>  and just missing it,</i>

08:50.831 --> 08:53.064
it's not easy one to swallow.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.134
[joe speaking]

08:57.571 --> 08:59.137
yeah, this really sucks.

08:59.139 --> 09:02.974
But we're going to keep diving
and keep making gold.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.409
<i> [narrator] in the end</i>
<i>  of season battle,</i>

09:04.411 --> 09:06.578

<i>  vernon,</i>

<i>  at least for now,</i>
<i>  has the upper hand</i>
<i>  in the gold count.</i>

09:09.850 --> 09:14.019
Nothing would
please me more
than to stick it to mr. Gold.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.958
[narrator] as the storm
<i> that'll shut down</i>

09:19.960 --> 09:24.596
<i>  winter mining grows</i>
<i>  ever closer,</i>
<i>  nine miles west of town...</i>

09:29.469 --> 09:31.937
[zeke] I was seeing gold,
right over in there,

09:31.939 --> 09:33.538
and then I was
within the call,

09:33.540 --> 09:35.574
edge of the call field
went over there

09:35.576 --> 09:37.175
and I think
that's my best bet.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.711
So we're going to go,
just kind of like
30 feet over that way.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.047
And I think that's
where the gold's going.

put this bastard
of an ice season
in the rearview mirror.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.960
<i> So it's all come down to this,</i>

09:54.962 --> 09:57.862
with all the bad weather
and the crappy ground,

09:57.864 --> 09:58.863
this season has been
really rough.

09:58.865 --> 10:01.833
We're finally on to something
good at tomcod.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.135
If I can stay ahead
of the storm and have
a good day today,

10:04.137 --> 10:07.806
<i>  I'll be able to get</i>
<i>  the eight ounces that I need</i>
<i>  to get through till summer.</i>

10:07.808 --> 10:10.041
If not, then I don't know
what I'm going to do.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.010
I mean, am I going
to hang up my wetsuit?

10:12.012 --> 10:14.079
This could be it.

10:16.883 --> 10:20.952
This might be a really
productive hole,
might be a really good one.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.755
It's been a nightmare,
an absolute slog,

10:23.757 --> 10:28.226
but she finally warmed up
at the top
of the mountain here.

10:28.228 --> 10:32.030
One more dive and we're done.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.067

10:41.608 --> 10:42.941
[zeke] okay.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.213
All right,
I'm going to go kinda
to the southwest of the hole.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.416
Let me go investigate.

[gabe speaking]

11:02.396 --> 11:04.362

[gabe speaking]

11:30.057 --> 11:33.024
[zeke speaking]

11:39.232 --> 11:42.834
seems like, from
everything that he's said that
it's been kind of patchy,

11:42.836 --> 11:44.069
so that can go
a lot of different ways.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.470
[zeke speaking]

11:47.007 --> 11:48.406
[zeke] what the [bleep].

11:49.543 --> 11:51.576
There's some gold here.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.311
[gabe laughs]

11:56.016 --> 11:58.083
[zeke speaking]

11:58.085 --> 12:00.185

12:15.001 --> 12:16.367

Hey,
we got a weather advisory.

12:37.858 --> 12:42.193
So, in an hour,
the wind is going to pick
up to 35 miles an hour.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.528
[zeke speaking]

12:45.065 --> 12:46.131
what do you want to do?

12:46.133 --> 12:50.101
[zeke speaking]

12:50.103 --> 12:52.337
all right.
It sounds like a great plan.
Perfect.

Anyway, but it's not going
to be like this for long.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.012
I hope a couple of weeks
of hell

13:34.014 --> 13:37.582
and then the baby gets on
a sleep schedule and...

13:37.584 --> 13:40.018
-[man speaking]
-[kris] yeah, couple of weeks.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.853
By the time,
the baby's a month old,

13:41.855 --> 13:43.321
everything should be
better in my life.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.091
[laughing]

13:47.093 --> 13:48.493
that's the strategy, okay.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.128
Don't [bleep] with me.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.064
The best strategy
is throw the [bleep] out
the door right now, buddy.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.834
[laughing]

13:55.836 --> 13:57.902
<i> [narrator] as the kelly's head</i>
<i>  out for the last time,</i>

13:57.904 --> 14:00.805
<i>  they're hoping the ground</i>
<i>  they're on is so rich,</i>

14:00.807 --> 14:03.975
<i>  it'll be like</i>
<i>  taking candy from a baby.</i>

14:03.977 --> 14:05.410
You know, we didn't do great.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.313
No, there's too many excuses.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.014
Got that right.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.983
Too many things to dial in.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.318
Throw a baby on top of that,

14:13.320 --> 14:17.956
you know, throw a crazy winter
on top of that,

14:17.958 --> 14:19.557
but nothing lit on fire yet.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.362
[man] get away.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.030
[man] [bleep].

14:26.566 --> 14:28.967
Yet.
Please don't light on fire.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.203
<i>  Look,</i>
<i>  most of the seasons sucked,</i>

14:32.205 --> 14:34.973
but you never remembered
for how you start,
only how you finish.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.108
And right now,
we're out of debt,

14:37.110 --> 14:40.178
making money on the best gold
we've seen this season.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.180
That's where you want to be.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.849
We should be
pulling out right now.

14:44.851 --> 14:48.453
Yeah, we shouldn't be,
we can push it one more day
and dive one more day.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.023
<i>  Almost every miner's</i>
<i>  off the ice,</i>

14:52.025 --> 14:54.192
<i>  but we're the desperate guys</i>
<i>  still out here.</i>

14:54.194 --> 14:56.060
Desperate equals crazy.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.161
Desperate equals desperate.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.763
Desperate is dangerous.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.832
<i>  But I have a family</i>
<i>  to take care of now,</i>

15:00.834 --> 15:02.066
<i>  and I have huge plans</i>
<i>  for this summer.</i>

15:02.068 --> 15:03.501
I need a war chest,

15:03.503 --> 15:06.404
so screw this storm coming,
we're going for it.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.009
[andy] you better do something
down there and put
as much gold in there,

15:11.011 --> 15:13.611
because wind is going to blow
the [bleep] ice away

15:13.613 --> 15:15.580
and we're going to lose
all of our stuff,

15:15.582 --> 15:19.050
so we should be actually
packing up right now
and leaving too.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.526
[breathing heavily]

15:33.266 --> 15:39.304
[kris] hey, hot water
works great, the air is good.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.708
I'm seeing
some great material.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.277
<i>  Everything's going great</i>
<i>  down here.</i>

15:46.279 --> 15:48.346
<i> [andy] everything's</i>
<i>  going great up here.</i>

15:48.348 --> 15:51.549
Fine. Finally,
everything's going great.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.052
[kris speaking]

15:55.155 --> 15:58.356
hell, now we're kind of
like the last man out here.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.960
[kris speaking]

16:03.229 --> 16:08.900
or it means we're
making the wrong decision.
Could work 50-50.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.436
[kris speaking]

16:27.253 --> 16:29.020
I'm on the gold.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.693
Uh, well,
get as much as you can.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.061
The wind's picking up.

16:37.063 --> 16:40.832
We got to make this dive
count man and get the [bleep]
out of here.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.334
[kris] I told you
we're going to do really good.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.071

<i> [narrator] and one left to go.</i>

17:20.040 --> 17:22.807
Well, you can man up
and take it yourself
if you want.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.542
[kris speaking]

17:40.560 --> 17:42.827
right now,
I'm going to get andy
underneath the water

17:42.829 --> 17:45.563
and I'm going to figure out
how to get this operation
wrapped up.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.067
Andy, last dive.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.736
Get in the water.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.872
<i>  The gold looks great,</i>
<i>  I couldn't ask for more</i>
<i>  from that last dive.</i>

17:54.874 --> 17:59.243
Now, we just have
to get andy in there
before the fat lady sings.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.979
Do what you do best right now,
get down there
and just clean this up.

18:01.981 --> 18:02.880
We're almost at the end.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.882
I need andy to come through.

18:04.884 --> 18:08.319
The more he gets,
the better chance we can start
the kelly empire this summer.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.455
-Hey, are you ready?
-I'm ready.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.789
Hey, your light's good, go.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.565

<i> the end, are you ready</i>

18:22.001 --> 18:23.201
<i> [andy] I'm ready.</i>

18:27.273 --> 18:29.240
I'm seeing some good material.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.179
I'm on the gold.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.581
Oh, yeah.

40 or 50 years from now,

20:55.088 --> 20:56.887
you just tell your grandkids,

20:56.889 --> 20:59.557
yeah, I used to dive
with vernon on 56.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.262
[gary speaking]

21:05.064 --> 21:07.131
I had to drag gary
off that primo gold.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.367
It's hard to leave
gold behind,

21:09.369 --> 21:12.003
but I don't want to leave
any dead bodies down here.

21:12.005 --> 21:12.970
Yeah.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.339
We might end up dead ducks

21:15.341 --> 21:17.575
and I'm not
in the dead duck business.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.211
You know, it's over.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.046
The ice is bad.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.681
We've got to move
like right now,

21:23.683 --> 21:25.883
but we had
one hell of a season

21:25.885 --> 21:29.820
and I'm hoping
this last clean out
will tie everything up

21:29.822 --> 21:30.821
in a pretty little bow.

21:30.823 --> 21:34.091
That maybe, just maybe,

21:34.093 --> 21:37.862
we got more gold than
anybody else in the fleet.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.463
All right, well,
let's get out of here, guys.

21:40.566 --> 21:41.532

We may have
one last ray of hope.

Seems to be getting coarser
as we're coming up
to that rock pile.

23:13.860 --> 23:17.294
Coarse gold, black sand,
for a miner,

Yeah, looks pretty good.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.469

it hasn't happened all winter,

this could be the jackpot.

right where we want it.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.248
[intense music]

23:45.892 --> 23:49.994
yeah, there was a nice
soft sand patch, right where
the nozzle dropped,

23:49.996 --> 23:54.965
and I worked, I worked
that coming up
to a big pile of rock.

23:54.967 --> 23:59.170
And it was getting pretty rich
coming up to it right before
shawn got in the water...

24:00.406 --> 24:02.473

what he's going to find
down there.

and keep going.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.844
<i>  I'm psyched to see</i>
<i>  what we got today.</i>

28:00.846 --> 28:02.279
<i>  Fingers crossed</i>
<i>  is what we need.</i>

28:02.281 --> 28:03.547
[engine revving]

28:08.988 --> 28:12.589
<i> [narrator] as the winds reach</i>
<i>  30 knots, one mile east...</i>

28:19.165 --> 28:21.098
How's it going down there?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.534
[andy] it's going good.
<i> Everything's good.</i>

28:24.904 --> 28:27.838
[andy speaking]

28:27.840 --> 28:31.909
<i> [narrator] the brothers</i>
<i>  kelly may have taken it</i>
<i>  as far as they can.</i>

28:31.911 --> 28:34.945
Andy's probably getting
as much gold as we can

28:34.947 --> 28:36.980
before it's the end,
it's the end.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.982
So we got to get out of here.

28:42.121 --> 28:45.989
<i>  Look, we pushed it like</i>
<i>  basically to the point</i>
<i>  of insanity,</i>

28:45.991 --> 28:48.358
but the fat lady
is losing her voice right now.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.960
She's singing so loud.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.231
[kris speaking]

28:55.801 --> 28:57.935
[andy] this hole's
basically finished.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.304
<i> [kris] okay.</i>
<i>  Come on, let's get</i>
<i>  the hell out of here.</i>

29:01.874 --> 29:05.309
You did a great job.
I'm proud of you.
We count this out together.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.446
Okay, I see you.
Let's rock and roll.

29:10.616 --> 29:13.083
For where we came this season,
disaster halfway

29:13.085 --> 29:16.019
through the season
with no gold
to where we ended up

29:16.021 --> 29:18.856
out of debt, making money,
ready to kill this summer.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.657
I'm really proud
of how we stuck it out

29:20.659 --> 29:22.359
and we came out on top
at the end.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.763
The nozzle's at the bottom
of the hole, hooked.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.565
[kris] okay. Good. Change.
I'm going to start taking
everything apart.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.069
Now we're done. Pack it up.
Let's go.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.172
Time to get the hell
out of here.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.574
[narrator]
<i>  while the kellys head</i>
<i>  for the safety of shore,</i>

29:45.918 --> 29:47.117

29:50.156 --> 29:53.390
<i> [narrator] there's still</i>
<i>  one last miner under the ice.</i>

29:54.026 --> 29:55.192
Woo-ee!

30:03.235 --> 30:04.434
[shawn speaking]

30:05.204 --> 30:06.570
yeah. She's pretty brisk.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.373

[shawn speaking]

30:23.189 --> 30:24.521

30:38.370 --> 30:39.570
she's pretty brisk.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.939
[shawn speaking]

30:46.245 --> 30:50.113
it sounds like we've got
a good end to a long winter.

30:50.115 --> 30:52.049
[shawn speaking]

30:57.156 --> 30:58.355
[laughing]

31:05.297 --> 31:07.030
look at this, joe.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.199
[joe] what we got?
What we got?

31:09.201 --> 31:11.535
-[shawn] there you go.
-[joe] oh, man.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.441
Thicker rocks [bleep],
man, dude.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.176
[laughing]

31:20.679 --> 31:22.112
woo-ee!

31:23.282 --> 31:28.252
I'm a big believer
in perseverance pays off.
And today it did.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.720
Nugget.

31:29.722 --> 31:32.789
Oh, that's a dime.

31:32.791 --> 31:35.692
Wish we could
have found it
earlier in the season.

31:35.694 --> 31:39.029
But bottom line,
it's one hell of a way
to end the winter.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.131
It'll be a great way
to start summer.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.100
The box is loaded.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.335
Man, look at that.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.510
<i> [narrator] and now</i>
<i>  social hour with vernon.</i>

31:55.714 --> 31:57.447
Ah, let's see.

Somebody named billy's
<i>  mullet.</i>

32:04.189 --> 32:05.555
[laughing]

32:05.557 --> 32:09.159
well, I've been known to eat
a cookie or two.

32:10.996 --> 32:12.529
Okay. One more and I'm done.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.232
<i>  Have I been vaccinated?</i>

32:15.801 --> 32:20.103
I was circumcised

I might add, I mean,
when you're making your way
through this world,

32:23.809 --> 32:27.377
well, you need every edge
you can get.

32:29.048 --> 32:29.780
[man] I didn't expect that.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.248
[laughing]

32:36.555 --> 32:40.657
<i> [narrator] this has been</i>
<i>  another episode</i>
<i>  of social hour with vernon.</i>

32:40.659 --> 32:43.760
Things are going down
the tube real fast.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.264
I got to get out of here
before I get canceled.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.967
I'd be canceled already,
but you know what?

32:52.871 --> 32:54.371
[narrator]
<i>  off the coast of nome,</i>

32:54.373 --> 32:57.407

32:59.378 --> 33:00.944
<i>  And in town...</i>

33:07.286 --> 33:09.019
[zeke] this will be our last
clean-up.

33:09.021 --> 33:12.055
I hope we're breaking
even to be honest.

33:12.057 --> 33:14.558
Yeah, worst
season I've ever seen.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.126
It was well thought.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.795
<i> [narrator] zeke tenhoff's</i>
<i>  hoping to spoils of war</i>

33:18.797 --> 33:20.831
<i>  will be enough to keep he</i>
<i>  and his crew</i>

33:20.833 --> 33:22.966
<i>  on the battlefield</i>
<i>  this summer.</i>

33:22.968 --> 33:25.202
That doesn't look too shabby.
I like it.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.103
I mean, I was seeing
some good gold.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.538
So I'm super stoked

33:28.540 --> 33:32.409
to have color
in this coming up
after what we've been through,

33:32.411 --> 33:34.644
I mean, it's just amazing
to see.

33:34.646 --> 33:38.715
I love it.
I'm a happy, happy man.

33:38.717 --> 33:42.052
<i> [zeke] I'm totally exhausted,</i>
<i>  but I'm feeling optimistic.</i>

33:42.054 --> 33:44.554
<i>  We only need about two ounces</i>
<i>  to keep going,</i>

33:44.556 --> 33:46.556
and I know we've given it
everything that we've got.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.993
I think the gold gods
will smiled down upon us
on this day.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.466
Now, we got half an ounce.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.069
There's one,

34:00.973 --> 34:02.172
one-and-half,

34:02.841 --> 34:06.843
and we're coming right by 2,

34:06.845 --> 34:09.413
and 2.5, I think
we're going to hit three.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.582
Come on. All right.

34:13.085 --> 34:16.753
3.63.

34:16.755 --> 34:21.792
<i> [narrator] 3.63 ounces</i>
<i>  give zeke 8.67 ounces</i>
<i>  for the season.</i>

34:21.794 --> 34:26.263
<i>  That's over $16,000,</i>
<i>  enough to carry the boys</i>
<i>  from winter...</i>

34:26.265 --> 34:29.866
That's going to be enough
of a payday to roll me
over into the next season.

34:29.868 --> 34:30.901
<i> [narrator] into summer.</i>

34:30.903 --> 34:33.970
Yeah, I mean,
the ocean's melting,
as we speak.

34:33.972 --> 34:37.340
I mean, I only got a few weeks
to get my boat ready
for the summertime.

34:38.077 --> 34:39.810
<i>  I know that ice mining</i>
<i>  is hard,</i>

34:39.812 --> 34:43.947
but this was way harder
than I anticipated
and it definitely tested me.

34:43.949 --> 34:46.249
<i>  I mean, how much</i>
<i>  can get thrown in our faces</i>

34:46.251 --> 34:48.018
<i>  and we can still keep going</i>
<i>  and survive?</i>

34:48.020 --> 34:50.554
That affirmation
is very rewarding.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.557
And now, I'm super stoked
about this summer.
Let's do it.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.458
To one more ice season.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.093
Don't spend it
all in one place.

34:57.029 --> 34:58.128
Daddy and a caddy.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.763
We'll get there.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.298
<i> [narrator] down the road...</i>

35:03.569 --> 35:05.402
<i> [kris] yeah.</i>
<i>  The material is looking good</i>
<i>  right now.</i>

35:06.839 --> 35:11.007
<i>  Oh, gold in here</i>
<i>  is starting to stack up.</i>

35:11.643 --> 35:13.343
We did better
than I thought we did.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.947
[narrator]
<i>  despite starting the season</i>
<i>  deep in debt,</i>

35:16.949 --> 35:19.116
<i>  the kellys crawl back</i>

35:19.118 --> 35:23.420
<i>  and they're ready to see</i>
<i>  how high of a note</i>
<i>  they've finished on.</i>

35:24.189 --> 35:25.989
[kris] we did great.
We killed it.

35:25.991 --> 35:29.192
We're in the black now.
Everything's going good.

35:29.194 --> 35:31.294
I'm glad
we're done with the season.
My body is done.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.129
I'm done too.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.197
You need to heal
your [bleep] arm.

35:34.199 --> 35:37.000
We need to start going
to the gym more or something,

35:37.002 --> 35:40.036
just because
we need more stamina.

35:40.038 --> 35:42.072
You know, in the past,
I'd be really pissed off

35:42.074 --> 35:44.541
when we had an
unsuccessful season,

35:44.543 --> 35:46.776
but I would have
just accepted it and move on.

35:46.778 --> 35:50.180
Not now, not with the baby.
We had to succeed.

35:50.182 --> 35:54.184
<i>  And you know what? We did,</i>
<i>  now we're just counting</i>
<i>  how big our profits are.</i>

35:54.186 --> 35:56.553
What a great feeling that is.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.021
Hey, let's see what we got.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.091
Come on.

36:01.860 --> 36:05.061
Three ounces, lots of chunky.

36:05.063 --> 36:08.765
That place has got
everything chunky, fine.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.200
Oh, I love that gold.

36:12.638 --> 36:15.939
6.8 ounces, good day at work.

36:15.941 --> 36:20.911
<i> [narrator] 6.84 ounces</i>
<i>  brings the kelly total</i>
<i>  to 45 ounces,</i>

36:20.913 --> 36:22.946
<i>  worth over 85 grand,</i>

36:22.948 --> 36:26.550
<i> giving them a hearty war chest</i>
<i>  for summer.</i>

36:26.552 --> 36:28.418
But now we're back on,
not on top,

36:28.420 --> 36:29.986
but at least
we're at one, two.

36:29.988 --> 36:34.191
We're at two,
so we're slowly
crawling back up there.

36:34.193 --> 36:37.227
This is the dawning
of a new day for the kellys,

36:37.229 --> 36:39.029
money in our pockets
to start with.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.931
Are you kidding me?

36:40.933 --> 36:42.365
<i>  This summer</i>
<i>  is going to be great.</i>

36:42.367 --> 36:45.835
<i> We're going to take this money</i>
<i>  and make this operation grow</i>
<i>  a lot.</i>

36:45.837 --> 36:48.905
We're aiming for an empire.
Mark my words.

36:48.907 --> 36:49.973
This summer,
if everything works out,

36:49.975 --> 36:51.875
we'll have a brand new
eight-inch boat.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.944
You know, we'll get out there
and we'll just kill it.

36:53.946 --> 36:57.047
This is probably going to be
a 200-ounce summer for us.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.683
[andy]
<i>  I'm just looking forward</i>
<i>  to no snow.</i>

The nuggets are just
pouring out of the gravel,

just kept pouring
and it was like,
tink, tink, tink.

37:17.970 --> 37:19.736
Did you hear them
hitting the nozzle?

37:19.738 --> 37:22.138
[narrator]
<i>  mr. Gold is about to find out</i>

[shawn]
one of the hardest winters

37:28.580 --> 37:30.247
It's definitely worth
pushing through,

37:30.249 --> 37:32.749
because that last hole
was a hot one.

I'm telling you buying 56
was the best move
I've ever made in my life.

That's quite a haul.

For a little pan...

Look at all those nuggets.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.514

39:28.867 --> 39:32.435
instead of a few weeks
to mine this stuff,
the sky's the limit.

39:33.772 --> 39:37.073
It is going to pile up
this summer,
we're going to kill it.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.975
Mining's not just about
grinding it out,

39:38.977 --> 39:41.544
paying the bills,
staying in the black.

39:41.546 --> 39:45.248
<i>  To me,</i>
<i>  it's something way bigger.</i>
<i>  That's following my dream.</i>

39:45.250 --> 39:46.249
It's the hunt.

39:46.251 --> 39:49.352
It's finding something
that nobody else can find.

39:49.354 --> 39:52.756
<i>  It's times like these,</i>
<i>  that rekindle my passion</i>
<i>  for mining.</i>

39:52.758 --> 39:55.558
<i>  Reminds me</i>
<i>  of why I got into it</i>
<i>  in the first place.</i>

39:55.560 --> 39:59.562
And let me tell you,
it doesn't hurt
when it's a boatload of money.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.064
Unstoppable.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.900
Yeah. This is going
to fill up some buckets.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.469
<i> [shawn] I can't wait</i>
<i>  to get back out there</i>
<i>  this summer.</i>

40:08.006 --> 40:11.241
<i>  Days like that</i>
<i>  is what keeps you mining.</i>

40:13.044 --> 40:14.911
[narrator]
<i>  in the final moments</i>
<i>  of winter,</i>

40:14.913 --> 40:20.150
<i>  shawn vaults to the top</i>
<i>  while vernon stand strong</i>
<i>  as a titan.</i>

40:21.953 --> 40:24.120
<i>  Next summer</i>
<i>  on bering sea gold...</i>

40:24.122 --> 40:26.089
Battle stations!

40:26.358 --> 40:28.892
<i>  It's a clash of empires.</i>

40:28.894 --> 40:30.326
You're going to go down.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.095
Hey, you want to fight
[bleep].

40:32.097 --> 40:36.533
This is all very crazy,
been using that word a lot,
because that is what it is.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.568
You got jane kilcher here.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.003
It's like the wild wild west
out here.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.204
-[bleep] you.
-[bleep]

40:41.206 --> 40:44.174
yeah, baby, it's gold time.

40:44.176 --> 40:46.976
[kris] come on, andy,
get in there. Yeah.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.312
I can see the hospital
right there. That's good news.

40:49.314 --> 40:51.714
<i> [kris] we took a big wave.</i>
<i>  He flipped over.</i>

40:51.716 --> 40:52.849
It's not looking good.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.952
Now, they do call me
the naked sponge diver.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.320
Biggest nugget
I've ever found.

40:57.322 --> 40:59.189
That's huge!

40:59.191 --> 41:00.557
There's going to be more gold.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.092
We're making money, baby.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.694
We gave it our all.

41:04.696 --> 41:06.296
<i> [narrator] so man,</i>
<i>  your battle stations.</i>

41:06.298 --> 41:08.932
Not going to [bleep] quit
and I'm not backing down.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.200
<i> [narrator] because the fight--</i>

41:10.202 --> 41:11.935
I'm going to get
your permit pulled.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.303
<i> [narrator] is on.</i>

41:13.305 --> 41:15.305
Not until I get
my [bleep] damn money.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.040
[laughing]

41:19.511 --> 41:21.411
<i> [911 operator] 911,</i>
<i>  what is your emergency?</i>
