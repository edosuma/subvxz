00:01.134 --> 00:02.602
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:02.636 --> 00:04.337
My client was in shock

00:04.370 --> 00:05.405
at the time
of this interrogation.

00:05.438 --> 00:06.439
He had just
found his wife dead

00:06.471 --> 00:08.074
less than an hour
before this.

00:08.108 --> 00:11.077
I'll allow the videotape
for impeachment purposes only.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.546
He killed my sister.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.548
Don't tell me now
that he's going to walk.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.749
Mr. Barrett, we had hoped
to be able to introduce

00:15.782 --> 00:17.483
the videotape interrogation.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.752
And you can't?

00:18.785 --> 00:20.453
Not unless we get him
on the stand.

00:20.486 --> 00:22.122
This will only happen

00:22.155 --> 00:23.356
if his lawyers think
he's losing.

00:23.389 --> 00:25.358
Which means,
when we ask you,

00:25.391 --> 00:26.760
"Did your sister
seem suicidal?",

00:26.793 --> 00:28.228
a response
of "I didn't think so"

00:28.261 --> 00:30.230
isn't going to do it.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.232
She was murdered
if you know it.

00:32.265 --> 00:36.302
She did not commit suicide.
You absolutely know it.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.171
Did your sister say
anything else, sir?

00:38.204 --> 00:39.640
She said that
if she turned up missing

00:39.673 --> 00:41.542
that I should call
the police

00:41.575 --> 00:43.577
because Scott probably
did something to her.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.245
BOBBY: Objection!

00:45.278 --> 00:47.180
I know what you said to him,
how you coached him to --

00:47.213 --> 00:48.381
Hey, Helen!

00:48.414 --> 00:50.116
The man committed perjury,
Richard.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.384
We both know it.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.253
-I want to testify.
-I can't let you.

00:53.286 --> 00:54.521
Bobby --

00:54.555 --> 00:56.256
The defense rests,
your honor.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.525
We find the defendant
Scott Wallace...

00:58.559 --> 01:00.093
guilty.

01:01.828 --> 01:04.364
This thing was built
to bring children joy,

01:04.397 --> 01:05.666
and it's toxic.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.134
The number Ellenor and I
think is reasonable

01:08.168 --> 01:10.136
is 160 per child.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.372
Nothing is good enough
for what they did to our kids.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.406
$20,000.

01:13.439 --> 01:14.575
$20,000?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.142
Apiece.

01:16.176 --> 01:17.744
And we're only offering it
to avoid the publicity

01:17.778 --> 01:18.845
that this hearing
might generate.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.480
We have children

01:20.514 --> 01:22.549
with severe
learning disabilities.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.217
Even if that thing is toxic,

01:24.250 --> 01:25.852
the government didn't
manufacture it.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.388
I don't think we'll lose
at summary judgment.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.291
To say that the EPA knew
of a leaching problem

01:31.324 --> 01:33.694
and failed either to correct it
or to warn about it

01:33.727 --> 01:35.596
makes them negligent

01:35.629 --> 01:38.331
is, in fact, a question
a jury should be deciding,

01:38.364 --> 01:39.399
not a judge.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.667
What happened?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.335
We're still alive.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.574
Are your experts ready?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.342
JIMMY:
They're all set.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.577
Dr. Tilotson flew in
this morning.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.778
He's going to be great.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.346
He's very dignified
and very persuasive.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.181
Who have they got?

01:55.215 --> 01:57.317
The EPA?
How about everybody.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.786
They can't afford
to lose this case.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.888
The precedent would be
a disaster.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.156
She's nervous.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.525
I am not.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.860
Okay, look.
This is not like tobacco,

02:06.893 --> 02:08.461
where the jury's going
to go in thinking

02:08.494 --> 02:09.895
that the defendant is evil.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.899
There's no predisposition
weighing in your favor here.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.467
In fact, in this case,

02:14.501 --> 02:16.537
the jury's fears will work
against you.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.738
How do you figure that?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.573
People don't want
to believe

02:19.606 --> 02:20.874
that playground equipment
all over

02:20.907 --> 02:22.175
is poisoning
their children.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.644
They don't want to believe

02:23.677 --> 02:25.311
that the government
could know about it

02:25.345 --> 02:26.747
and just look the other way
because of politics.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.649
Well, that's exactly --

02:28.682 --> 02:30.517
People don't want
to believe it, Ellenor,

02:30.551 --> 02:33.520
And you have to be mindful
of that as you try this case.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.923
You are arguing something
nobody wants to accept.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.358
Okay, Bobby.
We get it.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.493
How is your science?

02:40.527 --> 02:42.395
It's circumstantial
but credible.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.565
Don't focus on proof
so much.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.966
It's hammering the fact

02:45.999 --> 02:48.234
that the EPA didn't test
this stuff enough.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.604
All right, Bobby,
we have done this before.

02:50.637 --> 02:53.239
We've been preparing this case
for eight months now,

02:53.273 --> 02:55.509
and we know
what we have to do.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.877
Anything else?

02:56.910 --> 02:58.779
Yeah.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.581
Win.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.350
â™ª (theme)

03:53.499 --> 03:55.268
You ready?

03:55.301 --> 03:57.538
Yeah, as ready
as I'm going to get.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.673
Aren't you
going in today?

03:59.706 --> 04:03.476
Yeah, just moving slow.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.312
You okay, Helen?

04:06.346 --> 04:08.381
Yeah.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.751
Don't I look fabulous?

04:10.784 --> 04:13.319
It's just you've been
acting a little blue

04:13.353 --> 04:14.755
for about a week now.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.023
Really?
Must be a mid-life thing.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.491
Promised myself

04:18.524 --> 04:21.494
if I wasn't rich
and famous by 30, I'd --

04:21.528 --> 04:24.430
I'd at least be sleeping
with someone who was.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.605
I'm working as fast
as I can, Bobby.

04:31.638 --> 04:32.973
Get Jimmy to help you.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.508
He's third-chairing
the Jamison trial.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.709
Look, while we sit
on our hands,

04:35.742 --> 04:36.877
Scott Wallace is sitting
in jail.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.579
Nobody is sitting
on their hands,

04:38.612 --> 04:39.680
especially me.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.848
I'm off to see him now.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.083
Bobby,
you are going to let him in

04:43.116 --> 04:45.385
on everything
he has to appeal?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.559
The injuries
are neurological,

04:52.593 --> 04:54.828
most likely caused
by a toxin.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.697
Did you form
an opinion, doctor,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.832
as to what caused these
neurological injuries?

04:58.865 --> 05:01.935
We couldn't make any findings
to a medical certainty,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.838
but it's my belief that
these children were exposed

05:04.871 --> 05:06.406
to arsenic poisoning,

05:06.439 --> 05:08.642
and it was determined
the likely culprit

05:08.675 --> 05:10.476
was a play gym
in the backyard.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.478
Okay,
and can you tell us

05:12.513 --> 05:14.748
why you fault
the play gym?

05:14.781 --> 05:16.416
The wood was treated

05:16.449 --> 05:18.418
with chromated copper
arsenicals,

05:18.451 --> 05:20.420
commonly known as CCA.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.956
It's a fungicide.
It's an insecticide.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.958
It's also a carcinogen.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.028
Over time,
it can break down.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.495
The kids touch it,

05:29.530 --> 05:30.831
they put their hands
in their mouths,

05:30.864 --> 05:32.132
and they ingest it.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.834
The neuropathy
these children suffered

05:33.867 --> 05:35.836
is consistent
with the injuries

05:35.869 --> 05:38.939
typically caused
by exposure to CCA.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.607
You can't prove
that this play equipment

05:40.641 --> 05:42.609
caused these problems,
can you, doctor?

05:42.643 --> 05:45.145
Can I prove it? No.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.780
In fact, doctor,

05:46.813 --> 05:49.616
you can't even prove
to a medical certainty

05:49.650 --> 05:52.152
that exposure to CCA
even causes

05:52.185 --> 05:55.121
neurological damage
of any kind, can you?

05:55.155 --> 05:57.123
There is certainly enough
anecdotal evidence

05:57.157 --> 05:58.959
to strongly suggest
that it does.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.727
Can you prove it, doctor?

06:00.761 --> 06:01.995
One of the reasons

06:02.028 --> 06:03.730
it hasn't been
scientifically proven

06:03.764 --> 06:04.731
is that we haven't done
enough testing to --

06:04.765 --> 06:06.733
You cannot prove it,

06:06.767 --> 06:08.702
can you, doctor?

06:08.735 --> 06:11.572
No.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.745
Ms. Gamble?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.815
Mr. Barrett,
thank you for coming by.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.183
What's going on?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.085
Well, nothing
to worry about,

06:25.118 --> 06:26.620
but, uh, you know,

06:26.653 --> 06:28.622
I'm anticipating
the defense to appeal.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.891
I think I told you this.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.893
And?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.460
My feeling is

06:34.494 --> 06:36.162
one of the grounds
they'll be raising

06:36.196 --> 06:38.031
is the veracity
of your testimony.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.901
I thought I could best
head that off at the pass

06:40.934 --> 06:42.736
by offering
polygraph results.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.470
You could take the test
in my office.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.006
It won't take more
than an hour.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.509
I thought they weren't
ever admissible.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.043
For suspects.
For witnesses,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.012
they can actually carry
some weight.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.848
I don't want to take
any polygraph.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.718
It would be a big help
to me if you did.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.687
I'm sorry,
I don't want to do that.

07:00.721 --> 07:04.691
Why is that,
Mr. Barrett?

07:04.725 --> 07:08.829
Did you not
tell the truth?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.964
I'm going to need
that polygraph.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.966
Otherwise,
I might be compelled

07:12.999 --> 07:15.902
to go to the judge
and ask for a new trial.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.138
I don't know
what's going on, Ms. Gamble,

07:18.171 --> 07:20.173
but I'm not taking
a lie detector.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.880
You could be facing
perjury, Mr. Barrett.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.082
I think you should
have your lawyer

07:29.115 --> 07:31.852
pay me a visit...today.

07:35.021 --> 07:38.091
All these names came
out of your wife's rolodex.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.094
I need you to go through it
and tell us who they are.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.029
What are you looking for?

07:43.063 --> 07:45.932
The desperation of it
will probably depress you.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.167
Tell me.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.269
Well, is there
any possibility

07:49.302 --> 07:51.037
that it wasn't suicide,

07:51.071 --> 07:52.939
that somebody else
killed her?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.040
What?

07:54.074 --> 07:56.042
I know it's out there,
but, well,

07:56.076 --> 07:57.678
she was leaving you.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.780
Suppose she was seeing
somebody else.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.648
Suppose
after you two fought,

08:01.682 --> 08:03.517
she called him
and he came over to get her.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.918
And killed her?

08:04.951 --> 08:07.187
I haven't exactly thought it
through, I'm just --

08:07.220 --> 08:08.955
I'm just groping
for something.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.658
Well, you're right.
This depresses me.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.794
Just go through the list.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.796
I want to know
who everybody is.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.798
What about the appeal?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.233
We're putting it together.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.979
Listen, Scott, um...

08:33.013 --> 08:36.817
you have one other ground
we need to talk about.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.919
It could cost me
my bar card.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.186
What are you talking about?

08:40.220 --> 08:44.024
You were denied
your right to testify by me.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.994
You were adamant
about getting up there,

08:48.028 --> 08:51.031
and I just cut you off
and rested the defense.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.933
I think it's an issue.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.635
Well, you did it

08:54.668 --> 08:57.003
because you believed
it was the best strategy.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.006
But in the end
it has to be your decision,

09:00.040 --> 09:02.142
and I totally usurped it.

09:02.175 --> 09:05.145
You might want to think
about hiring a new lawyer

09:05.178 --> 09:06.913
and making that

09:06.947 --> 09:08.915
one of the grounds
for appeal.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.885
What, can't you argue it?

09:11.918 --> 09:13.887
It's a little strange
for me

09:13.920 --> 09:15.722
to argue
my own infraction.

09:15.756 --> 09:20.093
(sighs)
Bobby...

09:20.126 --> 09:22.095
the situation that I'm in,

09:22.128 --> 09:25.098
it's not likely I'm going
to get out of here.

09:25.131 --> 09:26.767
I know the odds.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.636
Now, if I am to have
any chance,

09:29.670 --> 09:31.638
I need a lawyer who feels

09:31.672 --> 09:34.374
he's in the hole here
with me,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.877
and you're it.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.019
Now, doctor, can you get
the arsenic on your skin

09:46.052 --> 09:48.689
by touching
the playground equipment?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.957
When the coating
breaks down, absolutely.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.926
It can even be inhaled,

09:52.959 --> 09:54.928
especially
when the wood is wet.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.664
Have any studies
ever proved this?

09:57.698 --> 10:01.802
Yes, and the EPA
evaluated studies in 1978

10:01.835 --> 10:05.872
and further studies
in 1981 and 1987.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.407
All right, doctor,

10:07.440 --> 10:11.778
is this wood a real risk
in your medical opinion?

10:11.812 --> 10:14.247
Everybody defines risk
for themselves,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.316
but let me put it
this way --

10:16.349 --> 10:18.719
these things are
cancer death traps

10:18.752 --> 10:21.421
and they're in backyards
all over the country.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.157
Those EPA tests
about inhaling and ingesting

10:24.190 --> 10:25.892
the arsenic off wood --

10:25.926 --> 10:29.029
those studies were
on unsealed wood,

10:29.062 --> 10:30.296
weren't they, doctor?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.232
I believe so.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.334
The wood on this playground
equipment was coated.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.703
In time,
the coating breaks down

10:36.737 --> 10:39.005
and seepage
from arsenic increases.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.441
What about the wood we use
to build our houses?

10:41.474 --> 10:42.909
That's all treated

10:42.943 --> 10:44.911
with a termite pesticide,
isn't it?

10:44.945 --> 10:45.912
Yes.

10:45.946 --> 10:46.980
Carcinogen?

10:47.013 --> 10:48.915
Probably.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.751
So maybe even our houses

10:50.784 --> 10:53.219
are potential
cancer death traps,

10:54.354 --> 10:55.889
We can't rule it out.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.759
The house you live in,
what's it made of?

10:58.792 --> 11:04.064
Wood, but being inside,
the coating is less likely
to break down.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.200
But the outside wood
on our houses, our porches,
our decks,

11:07.233 --> 11:09.335
this is all treated
with CCA,

11:09.369 --> 11:11.271
same as the play gym
equipment, right, doctor?

11:11.304 --> 11:13.173
Most of it is, yes.

11:13.206 --> 11:17.043
So basically, we're all
living in death traps

11:17.077 --> 11:19.345
according to your
medical opinion.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.749
We can't rule it out.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.787
Overall, I think
he came off well

11:26.820 --> 11:28.454
and it was
a good first day.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.991
We still obviously have
big problems on causation,

11:31.024 --> 11:34.127
but I think
the jury is with us.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.997
They definitely are.
I was watching their faces.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.099
What happens next?

11:39.132 --> 11:41.101
They'll put up Feldman
from the EPA.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.903
Lindsay, are you ready?

11:42.936 --> 11:44.505
Totally.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.472
This guy is tough --

11:46.507 --> 11:48.474
he's got experience
as a witness,

11:48.509 --> 11:51.011
and he's not afraid to go
right back at the lawyer.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.245
I'm ready.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.247
If we do damage here,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.149
our chances become
very good.

11:56.182 --> 11:57.417
Do we testify?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.185
We've decided to hold you
for rebuttal.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.921
We want your testimony
to come

12:00.954 --> 12:02.155
as close to the end
as possible.

12:02.188 --> 12:04.157
Our goal is for the jury

12:04.190 --> 12:06.192
to be thinking of a family
in that room,

12:06.226 --> 12:08.261
not just chemicals
and a bunch of scientists.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.931
But your feeling is
it's going well so far?

12:10.964 --> 12:12.933
I think
it's going quite well,

12:12.966 --> 12:14.535
but...

12:14.568 --> 12:17.938
their big gun comes next.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.129
You okay?

12:43.163 --> 12:46.399
Yeah, yeah,
I'm just, uh,

12:46.432 --> 12:48.034
just thinking.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.036
Your cross on the doctor?

12:50.070 --> 12:52.372
I've got to get him,
Bobby.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.374
If -- if I don't
get him...

12:54.407 --> 12:55.976
You will.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.879
You will.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.551
First of all,
whether a district attorney

13:04.585 --> 13:06.419
thinks
a witness lied or not,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.021
that has no relevance.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.556
It does to me.

13:09.590 --> 13:11.424
It's the prerogative
of the jury

13:11.457 --> 13:13.560
to weigh his credibility.
They did so.

13:13.594 --> 13:18.164
Mr. Stone,
your client lied.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.033
A man is serving
a life sentence,

13:20.066 --> 13:21.902
in part,
because of that lie.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.303
Allow me to be

13:23.336 --> 13:25.171
a little bit uncomfortable
with that.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.907
Okay, Ms. Gamble,

13:26.940 --> 13:29.576
I'll put myself in your shoes
and feel your discomfort.

13:29.610 --> 13:31.912
Now you put yourself
in mine.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.180
Why in God's name
would I ever agree

13:34.214 --> 13:36.449
to let Kyle Barrett take
a lie detector?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.619
How about simple justice?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.253
I was away last week.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.455
Did the system suddenly
become about that?

13:42.488 --> 13:45.091
I don't find cynicism
persuasive.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.894
Well, idealism can be
pretty incredible, as well.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.130
I will not let my client

13:50.163 --> 13:52.899
expose himself to possible
perjury charges...

13:52.933 --> 13:54.635
I will grant him immunity
on that.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.337
Nor will I advise him
to help undo the conviction

13:57.370 --> 13:58.939
of his sister's killer.

13:58.972 --> 14:02.075
Mr. Stone,
I won't sit quiet on this.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.110
Please.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.146
What are you going to do?

14:10.416 --> 14:12.352
The Environmental
Protection Agency

14:12.385 --> 14:15.656
id extensive testing on CCA
throughout the '80s.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.624
We continue to test it,

14:17.658 --> 14:19.660
and we have
consistently found

14:19.693 --> 14:22.629
that it does not pose
an unreasonable risk

14:22.663 --> 14:25.498
to either children or adults.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.968
But with the possibility
of a risk,

14:28.001 --> 14:30.370
shouldn't the EPA
do something?

14:30.403 --> 14:31.638
We have.

14:31.672 --> 14:34.240
The EPA developed
a warning program

14:34.274 --> 14:37.210
which requires retailers
to issue advisories

14:37.243 --> 14:40.113
that CCA poses
potential hazards.

14:40.146 --> 14:43.416
Their contention that
we have done nothing here

14:43.449 --> 14:45.118
is false.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.120
Well, I think
their main contention is

14:47.153 --> 14:48.589
you haven't done enough.

14:48.622 --> 14:51.525
We have federal insecticide
laws to deal with.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.660
Under the law,
we have to weigh

14:53.694 --> 14:56.129
the potential adverse effects
of a chemical

14:56.162 --> 15:00.000
against the economic and social
benefits and costs.

15:00.033 --> 15:04.170
With CCA, wood lasts
up to five times longer.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.340
Now, this represents
a huge benefit to schools

15:07.373 --> 15:10.443
who could never
afford playgrounds otherwise,

15:10.476 --> 15:13.079
to poor communities
who could never build them

15:13.113 --> 15:14.548
without the preservative.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.550
But with the chance
they cause cancer,

15:16.583 --> 15:18.552
do we want
schools building them?

15:18.585 --> 15:22.022
Well, if it really
caused cancer, of course not,

15:22.055 --> 15:25.025
but to date there is
no conclusive evidence

15:25.058 --> 15:27.460
that exposure to CCA
causes cancer

15:27.493 --> 15:29.563
or any neurological
side effects.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.197
There just isn't.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.066
Are there any
conclusive studies to show

15:33.099 --> 15:34.434
that it's safe?

15:34.467 --> 15:38.304
No, nor are there
with most food preservatives.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.274
Should the FDA
ban potato chips?

15:41.307 --> 15:43.276
Potato chips don't contain
a pesticide.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.478
The pesticide is coated.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.413
It is sealed, counsel.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.750
What if the seal
doesn't work?

15:49.783 --> 15:52.218
You're aware
of Dr. Stilwell's study

15:52.252 --> 15:54.320
showing the arsenic
is leaching

15:54.354 --> 15:56.256
from this playground equipment
into the soil?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.759
That's one study.
The EPA has asked

15:58.792 --> 16:00.761
to see the data
supporting it.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.328
Until we review it,

16:02.362 --> 16:04.598
we can't attach
any scientific credibility.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.466
The State of California does.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.502
They banned these
wooden play gyms from schools

16:08.535 --> 16:10.470
unless they're re-coated
every other year

16:10.504 --> 16:12.506
out of fear that the children
could be poisoned.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.075
Many scientists feel that
that was an overreaction.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.043
In 1997, a group
of physicians

16:17.077 --> 16:20.346
and scientists
informed the EPA

16:20.380 --> 16:22.616
that wood preservatives
constituted a health threat

16:22.649 --> 16:24.150
to this country and --

16:24.184 --> 16:26.252
Yes, and conservationists
lobby us

16:26.286 --> 16:28.321
on behalf
of the rain forest.

16:28.354 --> 16:31.625
But without these preservatives,
more trees would be cut down.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.794
So kill a child,
save a tree?

16:33.827 --> 16:35.095
Objection.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.496
Sustained.

16:36.530 --> 16:38.498
You talked about the EPA
requiring advisories

16:38.532 --> 16:40.801
warning that CCA poses
a potential health risk.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.503
-Yes.
-Actually, that was

16:42.536 --> 16:44.805
a voluntary program,
wasn't it, Dr. Feldman?

16:44.838 --> 16:47.440
If the wood industry didn't
want to issue the advisories,

16:47.473 --> 16:48.775
they didn't have to,
and most of them still don't,

16:48.809 --> 16:50.410
right, doctor?

16:50.443 --> 16:54.380
This wasn't a situation
where a mandate was warranted.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.282
The truth is
you were all set

16:56.316 --> 16:58.519
to issue a mandate here
when the wood manufacturers

16:58.552 --> 17:01.121
suddenly lobbied Congress
to get you to back off.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.789
I don't know anything
about that.

17:02.823 --> 17:05.125
And isn't it true
the EPA also backed off

17:05.157 --> 17:07.828
requiring further studies
when the chemical industry

17:07.861 --> 17:11.097
gave $4 million in campaign
contributions to congressmen

17:11.131 --> 17:12.397
to lean on you?

17:12.432 --> 17:14.568
The EPA has never
been bought, counsel,

17:14.601 --> 17:15.836
I assure you.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.571
I show you the EPA's
1981 position paper

17:18.605 --> 17:20.574
regarding inorganic
arsenicals,

17:20.607 --> 17:23.510
and I ask you to read
the highlighted paragraph.

17:25.444 --> 17:29.382
All this basically says
is we don't know.

17:29.415 --> 17:30.851
You don't know.

17:30.884 --> 17:34.420
That same paper cites
a 1973 study which associates

17:34.454 --> 17:37.558
arsenic-tainted milk
with severe retardation,

17:37.591 --> 17:40.694
lower I. Q. s,
and abnormal EEG findings.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.429
That was a study
of Japanese babies.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.632
You don't count Japan?

17:47.868 --> 17:49.836
What else doesn't
the EPA know, doctor,

17:49.870 --> 17:52.305
-and when did they not know it?
-Objection.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.140
Withdrawn.
In 1996, the EPA

17:54.174 --> 17:56.710
failed to warn over a million
power plant employees

17:56.743 --> 17:59.846
-that they were at risk
for mercury poisoning.
-Objection.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.315
Because the coal lobby pressured
you, you backed off there.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.317
-Objection. Relevance.
-Goes to pattern.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.852
They were being bought then
just like they're being
bought now.

18:05.886 --> 18:07.253
-Objection!
-Objection!

18:07.287 --> 18:08.354
Overruled.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.355
You lay off chemical companies,

18:09.389 --> 18:10.356
don't you, Dr. Feldman?

18:10.390 --> 18:12.893
That is absolutely
not true.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.729
From 1989 to 1998,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.363
of all the hundreds,

18:17.397 --> 18:19.733
if not thousands
of pesticides out there,

18:19.766 --> 18:22.703
now many did you get
neurotoxicity data on?

18:22.736 --> 18:24.638
I don't know
the exact number.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.740
I do. It's nine.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.875
Of the hundreds,
if not thousands

18:28.909 --> 18:32.378
of industrial chemicals,
how many did you ask for

18:32.412 --> 18:34.748
and get
the neurotoxicity data on?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.482
Again, I don't know
the number.

18:36.517 --> 18:39.219
It's three.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.354
You guys are
quite the watchdogs.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.756
-Objection!
-Objection!

18:42.789 --> 18:44.490
Withdrawn.
Nothing further.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.677
Of the five names
you couldn't identify,

19:03.710 --> 19:06.780
two were maiden names
of married women you did I. D.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.515
One was a pool contractor.

19:08.549 --> 19:10.250
Oh, yeah,
we were thinking

19:10.283 --> 19:12.252
about installing a pool
last year.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.787
One we're still checking,

19:13.820 --> 19:17.257
and one was a psychiatrist --
Dr. Bernard White.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.525
A psychiatrist?

19:18.559 --> 19:20.527
Was your wife
seeing a shrink?

19:20.561 --> 19:22.395
Not that I'm aware of.

19:22.428 --> 19:25.699
He's in Cambridge.
I'll pay him a visit.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.605
Listen, on the other...

19:31.638 --> 19:34.708
I understand
if you want to replace me,

19:34.741 --> 19:36.710
I'd even recommend it.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.713
Can you recommend someone
as good

19:39.746 --> 19:41.715
who will try as hard?

19:41.748 --> 19:45.952
Look, Bobby, I'm glad
you think you screwed up.

19:45.986 --> 19:47.353
It's my insurance policy

19:47.387 --> 19:49.890
that you'll keep trying.

19:49.923 --> 19:52.458
I'll keep trying.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.761
You don't have to worry
about that.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.599
I'm not.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.907
They told us it really
wasn't that uncommon

20:06.940 --> 20:09.009
for a boy to have seizures.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.745
Did they test him
for epilepsy?

20:11.778 --> 20:13.747
Oh, they tested him
for everything.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.650
They finally settled on
a toxin getting to the brain.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.018
And what did you do?

20:18.051 --> 20:20.420
There was nothing
we could do.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.488
We got him on medication,

20:22.523 --> 20:25.491
which controlled
the seizures.

20:25.526 --> 20:29.930
We thought, you know,
that was that.

20:29.963 --> 20:33.934
Then, uh...

20:33.967 --> 20:35.802
Sarah started falling down.

20:35.836 --> 20:37.938
What do you mean
she started falling down?

20:37.971 --> 20:41.775
She, um...

20:41.808 --> 20:43.644
She would trip.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.612
If she tried
to play hopscotch,

20:45.646 --> 20:47.447
she'd fall
flat on her face.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.517
They thought maybe she had
cerebral palsy.

20:50.551 --> 20:53.419
And then things started
to happen with Everett?

20:55.556 --> 20:56.990
He can't read.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.893
He will never be
in a normal class.

20:59.926 --> 21:04.798
He'll never go to college.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.466
And you knew.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.801
-Objection.
-I have a boy

21:07.834 --> 21:09.369
whose body convulses,

21:09.402 --> 21:11.071
with foam coming
out of his mouth,

21:11.104 --> 21:13.073
and a daughter who keeps
falling down

21:13.106 --> 21:14.641
and a son who can't read,

21:14.675 --> 21:16.910
and you people have known
for 30 years.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.545
Your honor.

21:18.579 --> 21:19.913
Mrs. Jamison,
please just answer

21:19.946 --> 21:21.615
the questions you're asked.

21:26.687 --> 21:29.556
What was the question?

21:29.590 --> 21:31.391
The question was,

21:31.424 --> 21:33.827
when your son
started having seizures,

21:33.860 --> 21:36.396
didn't the doctors say
it could've come

21:36.429 --> 21:38.665
from a whole host
of chemicals,

21:38.699 --> 21:41.935
including the cleaning solutions
you kept in the house?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.837
And then I got rid
of all that stuff.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.573
Do you live near
high power lines?

21:46.607 --> 21:48.842
-Yes, but --
-And did the doctors
inquire about them?

21:48.875 --> 21:51.411
Yes. They ruled them out
as a cause.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.113
Did you and your husband

21:53.146 --> 21:54.981
undergo any genetic testing?

21:55.015 --> 21:57.584
No.

21:57.618 --> 21:59.586
I see.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.588
Where is
the play equipment today?

22:01.622 --> 22:03.456
It's still
in our backyard.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.959
You think this equipment
is harming your children,

22:05.992 --> 22:07.594
and it's still there?

22:07.628 --> 22:09.362
We don't let them
play on it.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.464
Well, why not get rid
of it altogether?

22:11.497 --> 22:13.800
-Our lawyers told us not to,
not until we --
-Objection.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.702
I need to advise my client that
that is privileged.

22:15.736 --> 22:17.137
She does not need
to answer that.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.372
It's also work product.

22:19.405 --> 22:20.807
You kept it as evidence
for your lawsuit?

22:20.841 --> 22:21.908
Objection.

22:21.942 --> 22:23.443
Sustained.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.712
Just one last question,
Mrs. Jamison.

22:25.746 --> 22:28.148
Did any doctor
who treated your children

22:28.181 --> 22:29.983
conclude that their problems

22:30.016 --> 22:32.719
came from the CCA
in the play equipment?

22:32.753 --> 22:35.055
Did any of them
conclude that?

22:36.757 --> 22:37.924
No.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.962
Thank you, Mrs. Jamison.

22:59.079 --> 23:01.447
We really appreciate you
taking the time.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.717
Sure. But as I told you
on the phone,

23:03.750 --> 23:05.719
I'm not comfortable
revealing information

23:05.752 --> 23:07.153
about my patients.

23:07.187 --> 23:08.589
I understand.

23:08.622 --> 23:10.456
You did treat
Mrs. Wallace, then.

23:10.490 --> 23:14.060
I know the identity
of my patients

23:14.094 --> 23:16.162
aren't protected
by privilege, Mr. Donnell.

23:16.196 --> 23:19.700
Nevertheless, I am
reluctant to reveal them.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.468
But as you said yourself,
that isn't privileged.

23:22.503 --> 23:23.904
And even if it were,

23:23.937 --> 23:26.640
it wouldn't survive
the death of the patient.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.474
Mr. Donnell,
I know what the law is.

23:28.509 --> 23:29.910
I know you can subpoena
my records.

23:29.943 --> 23:31.812
Hence, I agreed
to this meeting.

23:31.845 --> 23:35.716
Could you tell us what
you were treating her for?

23:35.749 --> 23:39.686
Anxiety, sleepless
and depression.

23:40.921 --> 23:43.156
Did you say depression?

23:43.189 --> 23:46.827
-Yes.
-You know that we argued
that she killed herself.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.995
Yes, I read the papers.

23:49.029 --> 23:50.931
Well, why didn't you
come forward?

23:50.964 --> 23:52.766
The prosecution was claiming
she wasn't suicidal.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.935
You had information
that she was depressed.

23:54.968 --> 23:58.038
Mr. Donnell, 80%
of my patients are depressed.

23:58.071 --> 23:59.906
They don't typically
take their own lives.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.908
But sometimes they do.

24:01.942 --> 24:04.044
-How could you sit on this?
-I sat on this
because I don't believe

24:04.077 --> 24:07.548
that Karen was suicidal.
Secondly, if psychiatrists

24:07.581 --> 24:09.583
start speaking posthumously
on their patients

24:09.616 --> 24:11.518
that could have a chilling
effect on treatment.

24:11.552 --> 24:13.720
Most people want
their record sealed,

24:13.754 --> 24:15.589
before their
death and after.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.190
We had a man charged
with murder here.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.892
The jury convicted him

24:18.925 --> 24:21.061
because they didn't believe
the idea she was depressed.

24:21.094 --> 24:22.228
Don't yell at me.

24:22.262 --> 24:24.030
-I will yell at you!
-Bobby.

24:24.064 --> 24:25.999
-What the hell
were you thinking?
-All right.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.968
-I was thinking
she was probably murdered.
-Well, you were wrong!

24:28.001 --> 24:29.102
Bobby.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.177
We need this guy.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.151
Can we get those records?

24:45.185 --> 24:47.187
Please.

24:53.293 --> 24:55.829
We live
in a land of chemicals,

24:55.862 --> 24:58.865
and it's
pretty out of control.

24:58.899 --> 25:01.301
There's an epidemic
of autism in California.

25:01.334 --> 25:05.038
It's up over 200%
in the last 13 years.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.607
In New York,

25:06.640 --> 25:09.309
learning disabilities
are up 55%.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.144
The likely culprit --

25:11.177 --> 25:12.746
chemicals.

25:12.779 --> 25:15.148
And we can't expect
the private industries

25:15.181 --> 25:17.250
to monitor themselves.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.653
The market
is just too competitive,

25:19.686 --> 25:21.555
just like
in everything else.

25:21.588 --> 25:22.923
If the wood manufacturers

25:22.956 --> 25:25.559
can make these play gyms
and deck porches better --

25:25.592 --> 25:27.561
more profitable --
they will,

25:27.594 --> 25:30.764
and they won't worry
about the toxic side effects,

25:30.797 --> 25:34.134
and that's why
we need the EPA.

25:34.167 --> 25:36.837
Just like, as the airlines
become more competitive

25:36.870 --> 25:40.173
and cut back on their mechanics
to increase profits,

25:40.206 --> 25:42.676
we need the FAA
to step in and protect us,

25:42.709 --> 25:45.111
so, too,
do we need the EPA

25:45.145 --> 25:48.281
to fulfill its duty
to the public.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.117
And the fact is
they're not.

25:51.151 --> 25:54.855
They've known for decades
it could be dangerous,

25:54.888 --> 25:59.259
and they have done nothing.

25:59.292 --> 26:03.263
They are still doing nothing.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.331
Why?

26:05.365 --> 26:09.069
In part because of politics.

26:09.102 --> 26:11.805
Campaign contributions
from chemical companies

26:11.838 --> 26:16.076
and wood manufacturers have
resulted in successful lobbying

26:16.109 --> 26:19.646
to get the EPA to back off,
and children

26:19.680 --> 26:23.650
like the Jamison kids
are getting severely hurt.

26:23.684 --> 26:26.086
The EPA throws its hands up
and says,

26:26.119 --> 26:28.354
"Hey, you can't prove it.
We don't know for sure.

26:28.388 --> 26:30.824
We don't have the data.
The tests are incomplete."

26:30.857 --> 26:32.926
Well, why aren't they
ordering those tests?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.895
Why aren't they
demanding data?

26:34.928 --> 26:37.163
They have restricted
the use of CCA

26:37.197 --> 26:42.168
around farm animals
but not around children.

26:42.202 --> 26:44.170
Is it because
the farming industry

26:44.204 --> 26:48.174
has a lobby
but children don't?

26:48.208 --> 26:50.677
What is going on?

26:50.711 --> 26:53.313
They've known for decades

26:53.346 --> 26:55.215
that there's arsenic
in that wood.

26:55.248 --> 26:57.784
It gets out, it gets ingested,
it gets inhaled,

26:57.818 --> 26:59.786
and they haven't
done so much

26:59.820 --> 27:02.222
as to alert the public
of the risk.

27:02.255 --> 27:04.791
And that's all
it would have taken here.

27:04.825 --> 27:06.292
A simple warning,

27:06.326 --> 27:09.295
and the Jamisons never would
have put that play gym

27:09.329 --> 27:10.997
in their backyard.

27:13.099 --> 27:16.069
You heard their star witness
Dr. Feldman.

27:16.102 --> 27:21.975
He said EPA decisions are made
on a cost-benefit analysis.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.344
We need you to put
a big price tag

27:24.377 --> 27:25.979
on their failures.

27:26.012 --> 27:28.348
We need you
to make it cost-efficient

27:28.381 --> 27:32.085
for them
to protect our children.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.988
One thing is clear --

27:35.021 --> 27:39.926
if you don't, they won't.

27:52.472 --> 27:56.442
She's right about one thing --

27:56.476 --> 28:00.714
we do live
in an age of chemicals.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.984
Want to kill the mosquito
with the Nile virus?

28:04.017 --> 28:05.351
Chemicals.

28:05.385 --> 28:08.454
Don't want to get botulism
from your canned soup?

28:08.488 --> 28:11.191
Chemicals. Preservatives.

28:11.224 --> 28:14.127
And I suppose the EPA

28:14.160 --> 28:16.129
could demand proof
that every one

28:16.162 --> 28:18.398
of those chemicals
is completely safe

28:18.431 --> 28:20.200
before allowing their usage,

28:20.233 --> 28:24.004
and people would die
of contaminants and viruses

28:24.037 --> 28:27.841
and bacteria --
many, many more people.

28:27.874 --> 28:30.276
Almost every consumer product

28:30.310 --> 28:34.014
poses some
unproven health risk.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.883
Should the EPA ban them all?

28:36.917 --> 28:39.419
They studied CCA in wood.

28:39.452 --> 28:42.155
The EPA appointed a special
scientific advisory panel

28:42.188 --> 28:43.757
to look at this.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.159
Their recommendation
back to the EPA

28:46.192 --> 28:48.161
was not to ban the substance.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.830
Now, the plaintiffs

28:49.863 --> 28:52.766
may not like
those scientific findings,

28:52.799 --> 28:54.768
they may choose
to disagree,

28:54.801 --> 28:57.771
but this notion that the EPA
knew it was dangerous

28:57.804 --> 28:59.773
and chose to ignore the risks

28:59.806 --> 29:01.775
under the influence
of paid-off congressmen --

29:01.808 --> 29:04.410
that's as slanderous
as it is baseless.

29:04.444 --> 29:07.914
This is something
they are studying.

29:07.948 --> 29:11.184
The EPA is a government agency
doing its very best to keep up

29:11.217 --> 29:14.187
with this rapidly changing
scientific landscape,

29:14.220 --> 29:16.823
and the decisions it makes,

29:16.857 --> 29:20.193
they have to be made
on what is known

29:20.226 --> 29:22.428
as opposed to what's not.

29:22.462 --> 29:25.065
And today, like yesterday,

29:25.098 --> 29:27.167
it has not been
scientifically established

29:27.200 --> 29:29.803
that CCA causes
the neurological defects

29:29.836 --> 29:31.337
the plaintiffs speak of.

29:31.371 --> 29:33.840
And even if it did,

29:33.874 --> 29:36.209
they have offered
no medical evidence whatsoever

29:36.242 --> 29:39.345
that it did so in the case
of the Jamison children.

29:39.379 --> 29:41.948
Their own doctor admitted
she was speculating,

29:41.982 --> 29:45.485
she was guessing
at what caused these injuries.

29:45.519 --> 29:48.388
As much as you may feel
for these children --

29:48.421 --> 29:53.126
and you should feel,
as should we all --

29:53.159 --> 29:55.562
we have to admit
that their entire case

29:55.596 --> 30:00.567
is based on pure speculation

30:00.601 --> 30:04.505
and nothing more.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.359
You want me to sign this?

30:26.392 --> 30:28.194
It's what happened,
Richard.

30:28.228 --> 30:30.631
An affidavit saying
I coached a witness to lie?

30:30.664 --> 30:31.865
It doesn't say lie.

30:31.898 --> 30:32.999
That's the implication.

30:33.033 --> 30:34.100
Richard --

30:34.134 --> 30:35.201
What the hell
is going on?

30:35.235 --> 30:36.870
We both know he lied.

30:36.903 --> 30:39.105
He made that stuff up about
his sister being afraid.

30:39.139 --> 30:41.307
Helen, what are you trying
to accomplish?

30:41.341 --> 30:44.077
He should get
a new trial.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.481
I'm not signing this.

30:48.515 --> 30:49.950
Richard,
we can't just let --

30:49.983 --> 30:51.251
You're not taking me down.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.586
You might have some
professional death wish.

30:52.619 --> 30:54.154
I don't, and if you think

30:54.187 --> 30:55.956
that I'm going
to let you go forward --

30:55.989 --> 30:58.592
I was in the room.
I heard what you told him.

30:58.625 --> 31:01.494
I told him what his testimony
needed to accomplish.

31:01.528 --> 31:03.429
I never said lie.

31:03.463 --> 31:05.131
But that is what he did.

31:05.165 --> 31:06.499
You don't know that.

31:06.533 --> 31:09.069
Maybe he lied,
but neither of us know that.

31:09.102 --> 31:11.337
Maybe you can live with
this conviction. I can't.

31:14.007 --> 31:16.610
Well, I'll fight you
on this, Helen.

31:16.643 --> 31:18.945
I'll fight you
all the way.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.916
You know, Richard,

31:22.949 --> 31:25.351
it's one thing
to be competitive.

31:25.385 --> 31:27.921
It is another to try
and rack up convictions

31:27.954 --> 31:29.355
out of ambition

31:29.389 --> 31:32.058
with no regard
for a man's innocence.

31:32.092 --> 31:37.063
I don't believe
he's innocent,

31:37.097 --> 31:38.699
and if you go forward

31:38.732 --> 31:43.269
saying I coached
a witness to lie,

31:43.303 --> 31:46.439
your career could be over.

31:46.472 --> 31:51.411
Our friendship
definitely will be.

32:11.431 --> 32:14.568
I don't know if the jury
liked your closing, Lindsay,

32:14.601 --> 32:16.402
but the defense
was impressed.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.138
We have a new offer.

32:18.171 --> 32:19.573
What?

32:19.606 --> 32:22.509
$225,000 per child.

32:22.543 --> 32:24.310
That's $675,000,

32:24.344 --> 32:26.446
and they will
write a check right now.

32:28.448 --> 32:31.251
That, uh...
that beats $20,000.

32:31.284 --> 32:33.086
It certainly does.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.354
Should we take it?

32:34.387 --> 32:38.424
Well, it's hard
to turn that down,

32:38.458 --> 32:41.695
but I suspect they had
jury consultants
sitting in on the trial

32:41.728 --> 32:44.731
who had advised them
to settle, so I don't know.

32:44.765 --> 32:47.634
675.

32:47.668 --> 32:50.270
Could we get more?

32:50.303 --> 32:51.705
We could.

32:51.738 --> 32:54.007
We could also lose.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.611
I think we're going
to get more.

32:57.644 --> 32:59.012
Why?

32:59.045 --> 33:01.447
I just do.

33:01.481 --> 33:03.650
This isn't the time
to get greedy.

33:03.684 --> 33:06.252
It's not about greed,
Mr. Berluti.

33:06.286 --> 33:08.254
Like Lindsay said,

33:08.288 --> 33:10.724
we want them
to fix the problem.

33:10.757 --> 33:15.729
Angela has intuition
about these things.

33:15.762 --> 33:17.731
Let's go to verdict.

33:17.764 --> 33:19.533
Are you sure?

33:19.566 --> 33:22.035
Are you?

33:22.068 --> 33:26.773
It's going to be more.

33:31.144 --> 33:33.313
It's right here --
depression.

33:33.346 --> 33:35.281
He wanted to prescribe
antidepressants.

33:35.315 --> 33:36.282
She didn't
want to take them.

33:36.316 --> 33:37.684
It's all right here.

33:37.718 --> 33:39.085
Lucy, see if we can get in
to see Judge Wolfe

33:39.119 --> 33:40.453
this afternoon.
This is new evidence.

33:40.486 --> 33:43.757
Eugene, call Helen Gamble,
tell her --

33:43.790 --> 33:47.060
Helen, we were
just talking about you.

33:47.093 --> 33:50.063
We got new evidence
on the Wallace case.

33:50.096 --> 33:53.567
Really? I've got some news
on that myself.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.801
What?

33:54.835 --> 33:56.302
I'm convinced

33:56.336 --> 33:59.372
that Kyle Barrett
lied on the stand

33:59.405 --> 34:02.442
after being coached
by the prosecution.

34:16.156 --> 34:18.792
Is it a good sign,
them coming back so fast?

34:20.193 --> 34:23.563
No.

34:23.597 --> 34:26.431
Deliberations on damages
would have been lengthy.

34:26.466 --> 34:28.434
If they find
no liability,

34:28.467 --> 34:31.672
then the damages
will be moot.

34:31.705 --> 34:35.676
Can we still
take their offer?

34:35.708 --> 34:37.678
I asked.

34:37.710 --> 34:39.379
They laughed.

34:42.616 --> 34:45.585
Madam Foreperson, the jury
has rendered its verdict?

34:45.619 --> 34:47.253
We have, your honor.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.188
What say you?

34:49.222 --> 34:51.324
In the matter
of Steven Jamison et al.

34:51.357 --> 34:53.694
Vs. The environmental
protection agency,

34:53.726 --> 34:56.697
we find in favor
of the plaintiff

34:56.730 --> 34:59.533
and order the defendant

34:59.566 --> 35:02.468
to pay damages
in the amount

35:02.503 --> 35:04.437
of $72 million.

35:04.470 --> 35:08.208
(crowd murmuring)

35:15.381 --> 35:16.917
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

35:16.950 --> 35:20.721
ANGELA: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

35:29.930 --> 35:30.931
(judge pounds gavel)

35:30.964 --> 35:32.899
Your honor --
your honor --

35:32.933 --> 35:35.235
Settle down. This court
is still in session.

35:35.268 --> 35:37.638
Your honor, the defense
moves to remit the award.

35:37.671 --> 35:39.606
We also move that
the verdict be set aside.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.874
Opposed.

35:40.907 --> 35:42.776
I will see counsel
in chambers immediately.

35:42.809 --> 35:44.511
(judge pounds gavel)

35:44.545 --> 35:46.680
What's going on?

35:46.713 --> 35:49.516
They're looking to strike
the award as excessive.

35:49.550 --> 35:51.184
Can they do that?

35:51.217 --> 35:52.485
Well, $72 million
is a lot.

35:52.519 --> 35:54.354
But that's
what the jury found.

35:54.387 --> 35:55.889
Let us talk to the judge

35:55.922 --> 35:59.726
and we'll see
what's going on, okay?

35:59.760 --> 36:01.394
JIMMY: It's all right.

36:02.729 --> 36:06.299
The number alone tells you
the jury was off-base.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.234
The fact that they
deliberated for an hour --

36:08.268 --> 36:09.803
Maybe it has something
to do with the merits.

36:09.836 --> 36:11.204
All right.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.840
I'm granting defense's
motion to remit.

36:13.874 --> 36:17.310
The knockdown number
is $135,000 per child.

36:19.279 --> 36:20.380
What?

36:20.413 --> 36:23.283
You chopped it
from $72 million

36:23.316 --> 36:25.586
to $400,000?

36:25.619 --> 36:27.353
That's less
than they offered.

36:27.387 --> 36:29.455
I don't care. Your case was
pure speculation, counsel.

36:29.489 --> 36:31.357
This isn't a matter of law.

36:31.391 --> 36:33.627
You are substituting
your judgment for theirs.

36:33.660 --> 36:35.295
Which I am entitled to do

36:35.328 --> 36:37.664
when the verdict isn't
supported by the facts.

36:37.698 --> 36:39.299
We have a right
to a new trial.

36:39.332 --> 36:41.902
We do not
have to eat your number.

36:41.935 --> 36:43.403
If you take a new trial,

36:43.436 --> 36:45.238
you'll be right back
before me, Ms. Frutt,

36:45.271 --> 36:49.242
and any number over $135,000,
I'll remit again,

36:49.275 --> 36:50.611
if you're lucky
to win next time.

36:50.644 --> 36:52.245
There's no guarantee
the jury will be

36:52.278 --> 36:54.380
as stupid as this one.

36:54.414 --> 36:55.749
And if you do win, I might
remit the next knockdown

36:55.782 --> 36:59.586
to $75,000.

36:59.620 --> 37:03.023
I strongly suggest that
you accept this proposal.

37:03.056 --> 37:05.759
This isn't right.

37:05.792 --> 37:08.328
This isn't right.

37:08.361 --> 37:10.697
Meet with your clients,

37:10.731 --> 37:14.467
then notify my clerk
of your acceptance.

37:21.775 --> 37:23.810
Given this newly discovered
evidence

37:23.844 --> 37:25.612
concerning
the victim's depression,

37:25.646 --> 37:29.449
coupled with this revelation
by the district attorney

37:29.482 --> 37:31.718
regarding the veracity
of their lead witness,

37:31.752 --> 37:32.986
the interests of justice

37:33.019 --> 37:35.722
demand that the verdict
be overturned.

37:35.756 --> 37:39.626
In the alternative, the court
should order a new trial.

37:39.660 --> 37:41.995
I take strong exception
to the suggestion

37:42.028 --> 37:43.897
that I coached
a witness to lie.

37:43.930 --> 37:45.999
There's no evidence
the witness did lie,

37:46.032 --> 37:47.000
only opinion.

37:47.033 --> 37:48.802
Coming from Helen Gamble.

37:48.835 --> 37:50.571
Helen Gamble's opinion
carries no legal relevance.

37:50.604 --> 37:51.905
I assure you

37:51.938 --> 37:54.374
she has no credibility
within our own department.

37:54.407 --> 37:55.576
Why, because
she's honest?

37:55.609 --> 37:57.010
JUDGE WOLFE: All right.

37:57.043 --> 37:59.012
Your honor, this was not
our lead witness.

37:59.045 --> 38:01.548
This was a witness.

38:01.582 --> 38:03.483
Who supplied motive.

38:03.517 --> 38:05.385
You challenged
his truthfulness at trial.

38:05.418 --> 38:06.653
You have nothing new

38:06.687 --> 38:08.522
with which
to challenge it here.

38:08.555 --> 38:11.558
As for the doctor's report,
I spoke to Dr. White.

38:11.592 --> 38:13.560
He did not consider
Karen Wallace

38:13.594 --> 38:15.495
to be suicidal.

38:15.529 --> 38:18.398
The prosecution
portrayed her as optimistic.

38:18.431 --> 38:20.033
Which you also challenged
at trial.

38:20.066 --> 38:22.736
Not with these medical
reports, we didn't.

38:22.769 --> 38:25.338
All right. Ms. Gamble
brought her concerns

38:25.371 --> 38:27.708
regarding this witness
to the court's attention.

38:27.741 --> 38:29.475
As I told her,

38:29.510 --> 38:30.944
it is the jury's function

38:30.977 --> 38:32.979
to weigh
Mr. Barrett's credibility,

38:33.013 --> 38:34.114
not hers.

38:34.147 --> 38:36.983
As I go through
her affidavit,

38:37.017 --> 38:39.853
I don't think
Mr. Bay crossed the line.

38:39.886 --> 38:42.589
Lawyers prepare witnesses
all the time.

38:42.623 --> 38:45.892
I see no evidence
that he solicited perjury.

38:45.926 --> 38:48.895
As for the doctor's report,

38:48.929 --> 38:51.798
I find that to be relevant,

38:51.832 --> 38:53.800
but I am not satisfied

38:53.834 --> 38:56.603
that it would have resulted
in a different verdict.

38:56.637 --> 38:59.873
The conviction,
therefore, stands.

38:59.906 --> 39:02.809
Defendant's motion
for a new trial is denied,

39:02.843 --> 39:04.578
and we are adjourned.

39:17.490 --> 39:19.059
I'm not quitting.

39:22.495 --> 39:24.397
Well, what happens now?

39:24.430 --> 39:25.832
We'll go to appeals,

39:25.866 --> 39:28.935
challenge some
of the legal rulings.

39:30.604 --> 39:32.873
I'm not quitting.

39:52.793 --> 39:54.895
I don't understand.

39:54.928 --> 39:58.031
The judge
can cut back an award

39:58.064 --> 40:00.667
if he thinks
it's too high.

40:00.701 --> 40:03.069
What's the point
of a jury trial?

40:03.103 --> 40:05.672
We go through all that
with a jury...

40:05.706 --> 40:08.542
Well, judges
don't like to do it.

40:08.575 --> 40:11.812
With this guy,
I'm not sure.

40:11.845 --> 40:13.814
So if we opt
for a new trial,

40:13.847 --> 40:15.148
we'll get him again?

40:15.181 --> 40:16.783
That's what he's saying --

40:16.817 --> 40:19.686
that he's going
to keep it on his docket.

40:19.720 --> 40:22.956
It could be a year before--

40:22.989 --> 40:25.759
(sighs)
I'm going to be sick.

40:25.792 --> 40:29.129
I think --

40:29.162 --> 40:31.865
I think we have to eat it
at $135,000.

40:31.898 --> 40:33.233
If he keeps jurisdiction,

40:33.266 --> 40:35.602
he's told us
that we can't do better.

40:35.636 --> 40:37.203
We could lose.

40:37.237 --> 40:40.140
This is so unfair.

40:40.173 --> 40:42.909
We should be able
to get the money today.

40:51.718 --> 40:53.854
We got no choice.

40:55.722 --> 40:57.858
This isn't fair.

41:10.103 --> 41:12.906
You blind-sided
the department --

41:12.939 --> 41:14.908
embarrassed it.

41:14.941 --> 41:18.779
And now we have to deal
with a media that--

41:18.812 --> 41:21.582
I think that
it would be best

41:21.615 --> 41:23.584
if you submitted
your resignation.

41:23.617 --> 41:27.287
You're not getting
my resignation,

41:27.320 --> 41:31.124
and if you fire me
over this...

41:31.157 --> 41:34.728
then just watch the media
come at you.

41:34.761 --> 41:36.630
Why are you
doing this, Helen?

41:36.663 --> 41:39.032
We all say better to let
a guilty man go free

41:39.065 --> 41:41.134
than put an innocent one
in jail.

41:41.167 --> 41:46.172
An innocent man is serving
a life sentence, Kate.

41:46.206 --> 41:49.843
If this were Texas,
he might already be dead.

41:49.876 --> 41:52.679
When, suddenly,
did you become the jury?

41:52.713 --> 41:56.216
The jury doesn't know
he passed a polygraph.

41:56.249 --> 41:58.852
The jury doesn't know
a witness was coached,

41:58.885 --> 42:01.121
that he lied.

42:01.154 --> 42:04.858
The jury doesn't know
a lot of stuff, Kate.

42:04.891 --> 42:06.793
I do.

42:06.827 --> 42:10.196
You're right, Helen.

42:10.230 --> 42:14.668
I can't retaliate over this.

42:14.701 --> 42:17.671
So I'm going to just
go back to my office

42:17.704 --> 42:20.273
and wait
for your next mistake.

42:20.306 --> 42:25.311
Every day
I'll just wait.

42:25.345 --> 42:27.981
Thanks
for dropping by, Kate.

43:04.017 --> 43:06.352
Okay, look...

43:06.386 --> 43:09.690
we had a bad day.
We'll have them again.

43:14.227 --> 43:16.630
We can't just sit here
and brood.

43:20.333 --> 43:22.035
Bec's right.

43:22.068 --> 43:25.639
We got to concentrate
on picking up pieces now.

43:30.977 --> 43:32.979
I'm going to get him.

43:35.916 --> 43:38.018
That judge --

43:38.051 --> 43:40.153
I'm going to get him.

44:06.046 --> 44:08.414
â™ª (theme)

44:31.404 --> 44:33.139
You stinker!
