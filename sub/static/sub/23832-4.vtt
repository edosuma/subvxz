WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.011 --> 00:17.100
This is for you. There's one million yen
inside. You saved me before, right?

00:17.600 --> 00:20.770
This isn't enough to repay you,
but please take it.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.858
Knowing you, if you have money,
you can make more gambling.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.609
Thank you.

00:26.693 --> 00:31.781
Even after that awful defeat,
you'll believe in me and bet on me, right?

00:32.907 --> 00:36.703
- But I don't need this money.
- Why?

00:36.786 --> 00:40.999
The student council
hasn't actually asked me to pay any of it.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.835
So, I still have the money.

00:44.419 --> 00:48.965
No, that's impossible. I've heard stories
about how brutal the student council is

00:49.048 --> 00:50.425
about getting their money.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.844
I couldn't say why.

00:52.927 --> 00:57.515
But they did send me this instead.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.143
"Life plan"?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.450
Yomotsuki.

02:40.827 --> 02:41.661
Yomotsuki.

02:43.079 --> 02:47.208
Mary Saotome of Year Two, Flower Class,
has requested a meeting with us.

02:48.585 --> 02:52.338
The president isn't here,
but I guess I can handle it. Send her in.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.507
Come in, Saotome.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.140
You need something?
I'm busy, so keep it short.

03:02.765 --> 03:06.561
I received this booklet this morning
from the student council.

03:07.896 --> 03:11.232
What's the point
of this ridiculous document?

03:12.275 --> 03:14.402
It means what it says.

03:14.485 --> 03:18.573
Shut up! What is this disgusting text?

03:18.656 --> 03:20.074
SENATOR SAYAMA...
ENGAGED TO ORITA...

03:20.658 --> 03:23.578
I just told you.
It's exactly what it says.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.831
Everything that it says
is just what's gonna happen.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.626
Yes! Level clear!

03:34.213 --> 03:35.381
You're lucky!

03:35.465 --> 03:37.675
You get to marry a Diet member!

03:38.259 --> 03:42.347
Well, Orita's a filthy lolicon.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.016
I'd never want to marry him.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.518
But he's got plenty of money
and connections,

03:47.602 --> 03:49.395
so you'll succeed if nothing happens.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.358
Actually, it's already been decided
that nothing will.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.110
Already been decided?

03:56.194 --> 03:58.780
Yes, the decision's already been made.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.783
It's true that this school
has heavy connections

04:01.866 --> 04:04.160
in the financial and political worlds.

04:04.702 --> 04:05.578
But...

04:05.662 --> 04:08.665
Even if that's true, me, getting married?

04:08.748 --> 04:10.583
No way! I don't even know...

04:10.667 --> 04:11.501
MITTENS

04:11.584 --> 04:14.963
It doesn't matter what you think.
The decision's been made.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.967
And there's lots of ways to force somebody
to do what you want.

04:19.717 --> 04:20.969
Shut up!

04:22.679 --> 04:25.098
I refuse to obey this.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.850
Then pay us what you owe us.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.062
If you can't,
that's what'll happen to you.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.861
Better get good at pleasing a man.

04:43.074 --> 04:46.744
Marriage? Birth?
What kind of joke is this?

04:48.746 --> 04:52.125
This school never bores you, does it?

04:55.003 --> 04:59.424
Your life is placed under their control.
You're even given someone to breed with.

04:59.507 --> 05:03.386
A house pet pays with their whole life,
you see.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.013
THE GIRL WHO BECAME A HOUSE PET

05:05.096 --> 05:08.391
This is a big problem. If the student
council says they'll do it, they will.

05:08.975 --> 05:09.892
That's right.

05:09.976 --> 05:14.188
If I can't pay back 300 million yen,
I'll truly become a house pet.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.400
Uncertainty, apprehension, rage, despair.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.696
Even the very halls of the school
seem twisted and different.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.489
This feeling...

05:24.490 --> 05:25.700
it's wonderful.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.412
Hey, Yumeko Jabami.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.957
I heard you're Mittens now.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.710
Come with me.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.712
Kiwatari, from the Camellia Class.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.465
Yes, that's fine.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.466
Let's go.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.558
We've come a long way.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.853
So, what do you want from me?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.732
Take your clothes off. Strip.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.153
Damn it! What are they talking about?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.375
Oh, perhaps...

06:17.543 --> 06:20.088
Did you intend to get violent with me?

06:21.297 --> 06:24.092
I didn't say that. Now, get naked.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.428
I refuse.

06:28.096 --> 06:32.934
I don't want to let someone I don't know
see me naked, and you people are...

06:34.435 --> 06:36.813
very far from my type.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.364
If that's how you want it.
If you want to get raped, fine.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.034
Yumeko!

06:50.118 --> 06:52.578
- Hey, there.
- Stay out of this.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.581
Just stand there and watch.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.503
Hey, what are you doing?

07:04.173 --> 07:07.301
- Who the hell are you?
- Hey, this is bad!

07:07.385 --> 07:09.095
That's Midari Ikishima,

07:09.178 --> 07:10.680
the student council
beautification officer!

07:12.765 --> 07:15.017
It's not nice to get violent.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.479
As the beautification officer,
I'll have to stop you.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.151
Listen, if you need it that bad...
I'll do it with you.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.488
But it'll cost you.

07:30.032 --> 07:30.908
Of course!

07:31.742 --> 07:33.327
We gamble for it.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.499
One of these chambers has a bullet in it.

07:38.583 --> 07:43.463
I'll pull the trigger once. If no bullet
comes out, I'll do whatever you want.

07:44.046 --> 07:48.509
And if the bullet comes out,
it blows you inside out.

07:48.593 --> 07:53.514
- Well? Fun, huh?
- You're not making a damn bit of sense.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.766
I don't get it!

07:55.850 --> 08:00.104
Are you that scared? There's
a five out of six chance to screw me.

08:00.188 --> 08:04.108
If I was in your place,
I'd take you up on it immediately.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.278
In your place...
That's it! We switch places!

08:08.779 --> 08:10.198
You shoot!

08:11.657 --> 08:14.202
If the gun doesn't fire, just go home.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.578
And if it does...

08:16.871 --> 08:22.043
I won't be in a position to resist,
so you can do whatever you want.

08:22.126 --> 08:26.214
You've got nothing to lose.
And everything to gain, right?

08:26.797 --> 08:29.217
The only choice here is to shoot!

08:29.800 --> 08:32.220
Now, shoot! Come on! Shoot!

08:34.472 --> 08:36.057
What are you talking about?

08:37.016 --> 08:38.017
Are you stupid?

08:38.768 --> 08:41.395
Man, that killed the mood. Let's go.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.526
- It killed the mood for me too.
- Really!

08:47.443 --> 08:51.948
Why are you leaving? Show some guts!
Don't you want to do it with me?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.242
Yumeko, are you okay?

08:54.325 --> 08:57.453
Suzui? Yes, I'm fine.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.456
Ikishima.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.709
Thank you for saving me.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.420
- Yeah...
- I won't forget this debt.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.049
I'm sure I'll repay you somehow.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.971
Is that bitch crazy?

09:15.054 --> 09:18.724
The student council's a bunch of weirdos.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.977
They're like right out of some comic book.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.436
Seriously!

09:22.520 --> 09:25.731
But thanks to those guys,
we can make some money.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.484
We have to be grateful.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.528
Damn it!

09:31.696 --> 09:32.947
It's not enough.

09:33.030 --> 09:36.617
They just got me all hot and bothered!
Those bastards!

09:36.701 --> 09:39.579
Damn it!

09:49.380 --> 09:51.007
Just once.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.301
I'll just do it once...

09:54.010 --> 09:57.221
One in six.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.279
This! This is it!

10:13.863 --> 10:17.158
I'm alive right now!

10:18.200 --> 10:19.493
This feeling...

10:22.121 --> 10:23.122
Wow, it's amazing!

10:28.252 --> 10:31.005
Yumeko Jabami, was it?

10:36.052 --> 10:38.137
You're going to pay me back big-time.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.683
That was a close one.

10:42.767 --> 10:46.771
It's worse for a girl
to become a house pet than a boy.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.981
I need to do something fast.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.610
Yumeko, want to go to a gambling hall?

10:54.195 --> 10:55.446
What are you reading?

10:55.529 --> 10:58.240
A flyer they were handing out in the hall.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.619
"Notice of Debt Settlement Party"?

11:01.702 --> 11:03.663
DEBT SETTLEMENT PARTY

11:04.246 --> 11:07.708
Better learn how to please a man!

11:11.253 --> 11:13.672
What kind of gambling
will we do today?

11:13.756 --> 11:16.425
If you win, great,
but if you lose, it's hell.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.428
Maybe I'll drop out.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.519
Welcome to the Debt Settlement Party.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.938
I am Sayaka Igarashi,
secretary of the student council.

11:29.730 --> 11:34.693
Every year, our school has students
who have trouble with their debts.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.823
So, the student council has provided them
with an opportunity.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.827
We call it the Debt Swap Game.

11:43.411 --> 11:48.874
You will gamble in groups of four
and swap debts based on your performance.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.671
Rank first and you'll swap with the person
with the lowest debt in the group.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.840
Rank fourth and you'll get the worst.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.718
Your debt is swapped.

12:00.469 --> 12:05.266
The person with the least debt has
nothing to gain, you say? That's not true.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.560
In that case, your debt is erased.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.856
Now, everyone,
it's time for a second chance.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.858
Take good advantage of this chance.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.277
Hypocrites...

12:16.360 --> 12:18.696
That's awfully nice of them.

12:18.779 --> 12:21.782
Is there something in it
for the student council?

12:21.866 --> 12:24.118
- Yumeko Jabami!
- Hello.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.119
MITTENS

12:27.329 --> 12:30.708
I heard you lost bad
to the student council.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.210
Yes, I slipped up.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.505
You're participating
in the party too, huh?

12:36.589 --> 12:40.217
It's none of your business.
Whose fault do you think this is?

12:40.301 --> 12:43.846
Don't be like that.
We're classmates, right?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.268
I will now hand out applications.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.646
Write down the name of your creditor
and the amount owed.

12:53.230 --> 12:59.236
Many of you owe debts in smaller amounts
to multiple creditors.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.655
That would be enough to ruin anyone.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.951
Use this game as an opportunity
to transfer all your debts

13:06.035 --> 13:07.369
to the student council!

13:07.953 --> 13:10.456
They're basically taking the money
they've stolen

13:10.539 --> 13:13.584
and giving it back to students
to make them grateful.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.838
How shameless.
But their real goal is probably...

13:18.589 --> 13:20.966
I will now announce the pairings.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.386
Team A, Year One, Flower Class,
Karen Mozu.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.389
Year One, Camellia Class, Jun Kiwatari.

13:28.140 --> 13:34.396
She's 310 million yen in debt.
I don't want to be on her team.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.441
Year Two, Flower Class, Yumeko Jabami.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.902
Year Two, Flower Class, Mary Saotome.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.239
I'm so glad to be on your team, Saotome!

13:43.322 --> 13:46.659
Damn it! Did she put a curse on me?

13:47.243 --> 13:50.162
Let's move on to the game itself.

13:50.663 --> 13:54.667
You will be playing two-card Indian poker.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.627
The rules are simple.

13:56.710 --> 14:00.005
You'll use a 40-card deck
with jokers and face cards removed.

14:00.798 --> 14:05.678
The dealer will first hand out one card
to each of you, so take a look.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.806
The second card will then be passed out.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.810
Don't look at this.
Just put it up on your head.

14:13.435 --> 14:18.315
You have a visible card and a hidden card.
These two will be your tools.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.777
The strongest hand is a "pair,"
where both numbers match.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.446
Next, a "suit," where both cards
have the same suit.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.783
The weakest is a "pig,"
where neither the suit nor number matches.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.579
If all players have the same hand,
the largest number wins.

14:32.162 --> 14:35.457
And this is where the game
gets interesting.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.587
You'll be given ten chips
of varying colors.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.966
The number of chips
isn't that important in this game

14:44.049 --> 14:48.596
because it will be the sum value
of your chips that determines the winner.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.933
A chip's value is the owner's debt
divided by ten.

14:53.517 --> 14:57.187
If the total debt is 100 million,
one chip is 10 million.

14:57.771 --> 15:03.444
The game will take place over ten turns.
Players will pay one chip to participate.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.822
And you can only bet
up to five chips at once.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.992
My chips are worth
five million yen apiece.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.036
And Yumeko's are worth 31 million?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.830
How will this affect the game?

15:14.914 --> 15:19.293
Lastly, we will provide no help.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.004
This includes cheating.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.341
In the world of gambling,
the person who's deceived is at fault.

15:26.342 --> 15:31.555
If it's pointed out, we'll stop them, but
even then, we won't nullify past winnings.

15:32.264 --> 15:36.143
That's the only explanation we'll give.
Good luck, everyone.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.400
Okay, let's go!

15:43.859 --> 15:47.404
Damn it! This is the one thing
I didn't want to do, but...

15:48.072 --> 15:51.200
Jabami, I need to talk to you...

15:54.119 --> 15:55.663
TEAM F DEBT SETTLEMENT PARTY

15:56.622 --> 16:00.376
- We've been waiting for you.
- You're the dealer?

16:00.459 --> 16:04.380
Yes, this group has by far
the largest debts.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.840
We can't allow any problems to occur.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.845
Hey, Yumeko.
Guess fate brought us together again.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.100
- What a coincidence, huh?
-Kiwatari...

16:16.684 --> 16:18.060
Where's your tag?

16:18.143 --> 16:22.106
Didn't you listen?
You write down your own amount of debt.

16:22.189 --> 16:27.319
I'm not a house pet,
but I'm saying I owe a friend money.

16:27.403 --> 16:31.824
This means the student council
will pay my friend ten million yen.

16:31.907 --> 16:35.828
If I win, I don't have to pay it back.
It's free money.

16:35.911 --> 16:40.582
You're very confident.
You know you might go into debt over this.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.545
I've won this game three times.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.214
I won't lose to you house pets.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.426
It's like picking money off the ground.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.595
He's saying that
right to the student council's face?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.557
She's ignoring him, huh?

16:56.640 --> 17:00.185
This might force the student council
to take unnecessary losses,

17:00.269 --> 17:03.105
but they're letting anybody
write down what they want.

17:05.190 --> 17:10.112
We will now begin two-card Indian poker.

17:10.738 --> 17:16.285
First, pay your fee.
Look at your card and place it face down.

17:17.077 --> 17:21.165
Don't look at the next card.
Simply put it on your head.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.668
We'll start with Kiwatari, the dealer.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.171
Now, what to do...

17:28.505 --> 17:32.926
It'd be boring to fold on the first round.
I'm betting one Kiwatari chip.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.929
Call. One Tsubomi chip.

17:36.513 --> 17:40.809
Of course. The lower the value
of the chips, the lower the risk.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.897
The right answer is to bet big,
but we're not doing that.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.858
- Let's be careful, and...
- Call. One Jabami chip.

17:48.817 --> 17:52.488
What are you doing?
Do you know the cost of those chips?

17:52.571 --> 17:58.535
You can't play a game if you won't play at
the start. I have to play at some point.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.621
But that doesn't mean...

18:01.205 --> 18:02.915
Bold! I like it!

18:02.998 --> 18:04.917
Is she crazy?

18:05.834 --> 18:06.668
Fold.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.172
Calls are complete. Show your hands.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.174
Seven and eight. A pig.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.176
Three, six, pig.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.679
Three, nine, suit. I win.

18:17.763 --> 18:23.185
Kiwatari wins, so all chips are his.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.562
I told you...

18:25.646 --> 18:27.189
Moving to turn two.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.691
Tsubomi is now the dealer.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.029
Bet. One Tsubomi chip.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.447
Fold.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.782
Fold.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.284
Raise. Four Kiwatari chips.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.453
Fold.

18:42.871 --> 18:47.084
Everyone but Kiwatari has folded,
so he wins.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.795
You guys are a bit too wimpy, huh?

18:49.878 --> 18:53.173
That's how you end up as house pets.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.261
You aren't even worth my time.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.514
Moving to turn three.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.017
This is a good card.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.146
I'll bet one Jabami chip.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.857
You're finally ready to play, huh?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.984
Raise. Two Kiwatari chips.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.735
Oh, my. Two chips?

19:13.819 --> 19:17.614
To repeat what you said earlier,
isn't that a bit too wimpy?

19:17.698 --> 19:20.242
It's okay. This is a strategy.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.954
If I end up giving up your chips,

19:24.037 --> 19:28.292
which are so much more valuable
than the others, that'd be a disaster!

19:28.375 --> 19:32.087
Yumeko, getting your chips
is my top priority.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.298
And I'm not letting go of them.

19:34.882 --> 19:38.260
I see. Then I'll go ahead and win this.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.304
Raise. Three Jabami chips.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.221
What?

19:42.556 --> 19:44.474
YUMEKO CHIPS

19:45.058 --> 19:45.976
All right, then.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.729
Call. Two Kiwatari chips.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.982
Calls are complete. Show your hands.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.985
Lady luck's with me, huh?

19:55.569 --> 19:56.904
A two, five, suit.

19:57.571 --> 20:01.867
What a coincidence.
I'm confident in my luck too.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.327
A four, ten, suit.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.247
She's...

20:07.831 --> 20:11.376
Moving to turn four.
The dealer is Saotome.

20:15.339 --> 20:19.343
Yumeko's right.
At some point, you have to play the game.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.260
So...

20:20.928 --> 20:22.471
Bet. One Saotome chip.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.973
Call. One Kiwatari chip.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.725
Fold.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.228
Call. One Kiwatari chip.

20:29.811 --> 20:34.191
If I lose here, my life will follow
that ridiculous plan.

20:34.775 --> 20:38.695
I'll marry a politician, have his child,
and become the wife of a Diet member.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.198
My husband will become education minister,

20:41.281 --> 20:43.700
and my three children
will all succeed in life.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.994
I'll spend my last years

20:46.078 --> 20:50.707
surrounded by a loving husband,
children, and grandchildren.

20:51.833 --> 20:58.090
Mary Saotome will live the happiest life
a woman could ask for.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.301
Screw that!

21:03.178 --> 21:05.347
My life is mine!

21:05.430 --> 21:09.601
I won't let anyone have it!
I'll take my life back!

21:09.685 --> 21:11.395
Raise. Three Saotome Chips!

21:11.478 --> 21:12.312
SAOTOME CHIPS

21:14.481 --> 21:15.941
Are you stupid?

21:16.024 --> 21:19.278
You think after Yumeko won,
I'd fold and get scared?

21:19.987 --> 21:24.449
If I win, you'll only have two chips.
You won't be able to come back from that.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.784
Call.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.787
Of course, I'm not that dumb.

21:29.371 --> 21:34.209
I know what you're up to, house pets.
Saotome, Yumeko, you're working together.

21:35.294 --> 21:40.090
It's way too obvious. In this game,
you can only see one of your cards.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.968
No matter the number,
you'll lose to a suit,

21:43.051 --> 21:45.804
which has a one in four chance
of occurring.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.724
This is a good card.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.310
What you said is impossible.

21:51.893 --> 21:55.689
And it's even more impossible
that you'd bet 155 million

21:55.772 --> 21:57.399
on something so uncertain.

21:57.482 --> 22:03.113
It's simple. You were able to do that
because you knew you had a suit.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.282
It's obvious you're cheating.

22:05.365 --> 22:10.495
Too bad. House pets can't fool humans.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.205
Fold.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.292
Jabami?

22:15.375 --> 22:16.209
Fold.

22:17.627 --> 22:20.964
Yes! I was able to cut my losses to two!

22:21.048 --> 22:23.800
At this rate, I can win easy.

22:24.217 --> 22:29.056
You're sharp. I guess
when you're doing bad things every day,

22:29.139 --> 22:31.391
you know when someone's out to get you.

22:31.975 --> 22:37.105
Anyway, I'm glad I went big.
This gives me a bullet to use.

22:38.023 --> 22:38.982
What are you...?

22:43.570 --> 22:47.824
My hand was a pig, fool!

24:19.749 --> 24:22.002
- What?
- It's more fun when you cheat!

24:22.085 --> 24:25.881
- He who lies best wins.
- I had a pig and still won!

24:25.964 --> 24:28.758
This game is...
nothing but a series of bluffs!

24:28.842 --> 24:30.969
