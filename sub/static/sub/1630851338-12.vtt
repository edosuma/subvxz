00:02.770 --> 00:04.236
(theme music)

00:45.312 --> 00:47.379
(applause)
(indistinct chatter)

00:48.549 --> 00:51.683
(people chanting):
Mary, mary, mary, mary...

00:53.353 --> 00:56.221
(chanting continues)
- let's not... Let's not mix
business and pleasure.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.023
This isn't amsterdam.
(laughter)

00:58.158 --> 01:00.492
Does... Does everyone have
a glass?

01:00.627 --> 01:04.696
'cause I'd like to say a few
words, please, before you all
get too rowdy in here.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.298
(laughter)

01:06.300 --> 01:08.900
Goodbye, toronto.
Hello, new york.

01:08.936 --> 01:12.036
I know you'll all join me
in wishing mary
the very best of luck,

01:12.073 --> 01:13.572
Even though she won't need it.

01:13.707 --> 01:17.376
D.W. Griffith will make her
the star she deserves to be.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.444
- Mm-hmm!
- Here, here!
- To mary.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.380
(all): To mary.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.981
- Hmm. Cheers.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.917
- Bon voyage, mary.
- Oh, thanks, john.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.719
I'm going to miss you.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.455
- Sure you will.
But I'll be dining out
on the time

01:30.458 --> 01:33.258
That I was leading man
to the great mary pickford.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.727
- Come on, let's dance!
(up-tempo piano music)

01:38.933 --> 01:40.598
(laughter)

01:41.936 --> 01:44.469
- They look like dancing trees.
- Yes, they do.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.738
(chuckling)
- well done, charlotte.
- Hmm.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.674
- Mary would be nowhere
without you.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.076
- Well, the film deal's
all mary.
(man): Switch partners!

01:51.211 --> 01:54.846
- My daughter is as bold
as she is beautiful.
- Hmm.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.953
Berger has a bee in his bonnet.
Again.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.355
- Most unattractive.
- Mm-hmm.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.564
- You were dazzling
in rehearsal today.
- Oh, john!

02:12.699 --> 02:16.635
Do you think mr. Scantage
would put our names
onto the-the theatre marquee?

02:16.770 --> 02:18.704
- Why not?
We're playing the leads.
- Oh!

02:18.839 --> 02:20.572
(laughing)

02:27.581 --> 02:32.050
- Come on, mary, a quiet chat.
No histrionics, I promise.
- What's the point, blake?

02:32.086 --> 02:35.520
- Here's to the magnificent
mary pickford!

02:35.589 --> 02:39.191
Off to cheapen herself
in the flickers
where she belongs.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.725
(laughing)

02:40.794 --> 02:44.529
Good riddance to her!
And her loathsome mother.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.065
- Oh!
- That's enough, mr. Leavey.
- Bon voyage, mary!

02:47.101 --> 02:48.866
- Mary, darling,
don't listen to him.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.804
(up-tempo piano music)

02:54.341 --> 02:55.941
- How are you feeling
this morning?

02:56.076 --> 02:57.909
- Honestly? Terrible.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.414
If I stop eating, I feel ill,
but food is completely
unappealing.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.750
- Well...
You could always stay home.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.753
- William, I'm going to work.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.890
- Right. But rest is important.
- I'm going to work.

03:15.663 --> 03:16.995
- Alright.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.633
Should we tell everyone?
(ogden chuckling)

03:21.768 --> 03:23.835
- Let's not just yet.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.038
People are probably starting
to suspect something.
(chuckling)

03:27.074 --> 03:29.241
I'm running out of creative ways
of hiding it.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.410
- You could always become
a professional sign holder.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.581
- William!
(murdoch laughing)

03:40.120 --> 03:41.653
(knocking)

03:42.523 --> 03:44.456
(rapping)

03:44.458 --> 03:46.058
(knocking)

03:47.527 --> 03:48.927
- It's locked.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.229
(sighing)

03:52.633 --> 03:55.733
Blake had a skinful last night,
but he still has a job to do.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.102
- Did you check the stage door?
- Hmm.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.083
Ah, thank god.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.583
- Mr. Scantage.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.688
We found blake.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.370
(camera shutter clicking)
- who is he?

04:31.505 --> 04:33.838
- Blake berger.
The theatre stage manager.

04:35.542 --> 04:38.510
We had a party for mary pickford
last night.
Blake stayed behind to lock up.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.446
- Had berger been drinking
at the party?
- He had a few.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.849
Well, more than a few,
to be honest.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.983
- Maybe he just took
a bit of a nasty tumble.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.986
Not everyone can hold
their liquor like your father,
son.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.255
- Sir...

04:51.292 --> 04:52.857
The fall was no accident.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.204
Mrs. Hart?

05:06.273 --> 05:09.040
- Ah. I believe he sustained
a broken neck.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.209
- And the bloody nose?

05:11.245 --> 05:14.012
- I will have
some definitive answers for you
as soon as possible.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.480
- Thank you.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.084
Sir.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.885
- We've rounded up
all the party-goers.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.754
Higgins is taking
their fingermarks.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.023
- Alright. Let's see
what they have to say.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.059
Did the two of you leave
the theatre together?

05:28.095 --> 05:32.630
- Yes.
- We walked back to our hotel
at a quarter past ten.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.832
- Did the concierge see you?

05:34.868 --> 05:37.969
- No. The front desk
was already closed.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.440
- If that's all there is,
detective?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.040
- Yes.
- Thank you.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.244
- Ah.
- Ahem.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.917
- Blake was my right hand,
the glue holding the theatre
together.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.054
- He was drunk last night.
Was that common?

05:56.123 --> 05:58.190
- More and more of late.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.792
- What time did you leave
the theatre?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.327
- Ten p.M.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.329
I walked home to my room.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.264
- Did anyone see you?

06:06.266 --> 06:08.533
- No.
My landlady was already asleep.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.874
- Miss halliday, did you leave
the theatre at the same time
as the others?

06:15.876 --> 06:19.544
- Um... Shortly before.
I went straight home.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.345
- Did anyone see you?

06:21.382 --> 06:26.485
- No. No, the woman I share
my flat with is visiting
her mother in peterborough.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.154
- Who was this uninvited guest?
- Percy leavey.

06:29.289 --> 06:32.824
He was a director at the
theatre until mary's mother had
him fired a couple months ago.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.359
- What prompted that?

06:34.494 --> 06:37.429
- Charlotte thought
that he insulted mary's acting;
took it to scantage.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.297
Said it was either mary
or leavey.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.700
- Scantage chose mary.
- Mm-hmm.
- Anything else?

06:43.837 --> 06:47.572
- Yes.
When I escorted leavey out,
there was a man hanging around.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.508
Asked if mary
was still in the theatre.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.043
- What did he look like?
- Like an actor.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.312
Nice suit, fancy blue hat.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.114
- If you're mixed up
in something that's connected
to this murder, john,

06:57.151 --> 06:59.150
Now's the time to tell me.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.586
- There's nothing.
- Are you sure about that, son?

07:01.588 --> 07:05.257
After what happened with bobby,
your mother can't handle
any more upset.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.125
- I swear.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.795
- Not an alibi amongst the lot
of them, murdoch.
(door closing)

07:10.831 --> 07:14.866
- If one of them is the killer,
they returned when berger
was locking up.

07:15.001 --> 07:17.135
We need to find
this percy leavey.

07:17.137 --> 07:21.673
- I'll get higgins to chase up
the man with the blue hat.
Ah, speak of the devil.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.675
Higgins, did you get
everyone's fingermarks?

07:23.744 --> 07:25.743
- Yes, sir, and I searched
the victim's locker.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.947
I found this rent receipt made
out to berger for a warehouse
on front street.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.815
- Mm. Very good, henry.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.350
- Hmm.
- Sir.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.421
- Thank you.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.793
Seems like mr. Berger
was more than a stage manager.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.929
- It certainly does.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.569
This camera's been
heavily modified.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.372
- Looks like this is all filmed
here in the studio.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.080
- Oh.

08:08.455 --> 08:11.322
- Miss bright.
I see you've persisted
in staying here.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.991
- I have indeed.
- Hmm.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.727
- And I shall have a station
as high as yours.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.095
- I doubt that.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.465
- Come with me.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.475
I know it needs a lot of work,

08:31.512 --> 08:34.546
But I believe
it could be wonderful.

08:34.615 --> 08:39.884
I want to bring in
all black musicians, poets,
dancers, you name it.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.820
From all across north america.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.356
Maybe even from around
the world.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.291
- A salon?
- Yes.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.159
But for people like us.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.763
It took most of my savings
to pay the lease
and buy some furniture.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.567
- Toronto's not going to know
what hit it.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.501
- They sure aren't.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.538
- You have a lot of work
ahead of you.
- I'm not afraid of that.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.307
I do hope to see you
at the grand opening.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.410
You and your husband are people
of great prominence.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.579
It would mean a lot.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.049
- My husband doesn't go out much
anymore.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.718
- I heard quite the opposite.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.454
I heard he's something
of a bon vivant.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.323
- He used to be.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.392
I'm happy my life
is of such keen interest to you.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.329
Good luck, miss bright.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.731
Ugh.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.934
- Look at our son.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.269
Such a handsome leading man.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.137
- He's a brackenreid.
- Oh.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.607
I've had several requests
for copies.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.675
I was thinking of charging,

09:37.711 --> 09:43.481
Though maybe they'll be free
to fully paid-up members
of john's circle of fans! Ah!

09:43.483 --> 09:46.017
- Circle of fans?
What do you mean,
like a sewing circle?

09:46.053 --> 09:50.422
- Yes. Except instead
of gossiping about each other,
they'll talk about john.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.956
- What's the point of that?

09:51.959 --> 09:54.426
- You think
it's a terrible idea.
- No, no, no!

09:54.561 --> 09:58.162
Margaret, margaret.
I'm sure john will appreciate
the effort.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.299
I think it's a lovely thing
you're doing for him.
(margaret chuckling)

10:03.670 --> 10:05.437
Ah. He's got my jaw.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.038
- No, he doesn't.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.647
- Any luck?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.181
- Unfortunately, no.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.717
The fingermarks on the handrail
were berger's.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.921
- Anything noteworthy
amongst all these gadgets
from berger's studio?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.857
- Well, sir, look at this.

10:25.992 --> 10:29.994
This camera was specifically
designed to operate
at low light levels,

10:29.997 --> 10:32.063
And all of the moving parts...

10:33.233 --> 10:37.501
...Are kept inside
of this sound-muffling case.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.539
Perfect for clandestine
purposes.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.741
- A peeping tom camera.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.211
Maybe berger filmed something
he shouldn't have
and that's why he's dead.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.946
- My thoughts exactly.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.883
Perhaps some of the spare film
will shed some light
on what he's been up to.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.219
- Like a needle in a haystack.
- Hmm.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.223
- Anything to see?
- Allow me, sir.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.661
(whirring)

11:04.831 --> 11:06.831
(phone ringing)

11:09.502 --> 11:10.969
Detective murdoch.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.637
- Sir, I think
I've found our man.

11:12.772 --> 11:16.640
His hat was noticed by the staff
at the queen's hotel.
He checked in as a mr. Smith.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.043
- It's likely a pseudonym.
Very good, henry.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.714
- He's not in his room now, but
I'll keep an eye on the place
in case he comes back, sir.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.916
<i> - Thank you.</i>
- Thank you very much
for your time, miss pickford.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.052
Any final words for our readers?

11:28.121 --> 11:31.522
- Just that I credit my mother
for everything.
As my drama coach,

11:31.558 --> 11:33.925
She took me to see
the finest actors,

11:33.994 --> 11:36.660
But she always taught me
to be myself.

11:36.697 --> 11:41.332
- Pish. Mary's hard work
is why she's a success.
- Hmm.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.602
Well, bon voyage, miss pickford.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.537
- Pleasure.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.077
- Constable.
What are you doing here?

11:53.113 --> 11:57.281
- I could ask the same of you.
- I was assigned to write
a piece about some actress.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.283
- A piece about what?

12:00.353 --> 12:02.319
- About her.
- Oh.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.822
Well, alright.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.164
(soft piano music)

12:19.239 --> 12:21.038
- A girl, a boy and a chase.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.541
Why do people watch this drivel,
murdoch?

12:24.211 --> 12:25.443
- Absolutely no idea.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.379
- I must admit,
pickford has a certain charisma.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.315
I wish I'd seen her on stage.

12:30.450 --> 12:34.318
- You don't attend john's plays,
sir?
- I leave that to margaret.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.754
(chuckling)

12:40.360 --> 12:43.060
- Oh. Take a look at this, sir.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.531
I believe that's mary pickford.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.102
- Was that taken
with the peeping tom camera?
- I think so.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.540
- Mary pickford might not have
known what he was up to.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.876
- Or she found out...
And killed him for it.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.751
- No, I never.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.955
We kissed, but that was all.
I swear.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.489
- You're barely dressed.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.826
- It's the costume
from the play.
- It hardly matters.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.561
If there's a film of this,
the public will assume
the worst!

13:17.597 --> 13:19.697
- Blake berger filmed this?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.833
- It was found in his studio.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.136
- Where's this appalling film?
Who has it?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.771
- We don't yet know.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.440
These frames were
among mr. Berger's discards.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.644
- This needs to be handled
with absolute discretion.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.046
It cannot get out
that this film exists.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.448
- The man in the photograph
with you, miss pickford?

13:38.585 --> 13:41.185
- Out of propriety,
I'd prefer not to say.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.454
- It could aid
in our investigation.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.990
- This is improper
and embarrassing enough.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.559
I won't expose anyone else
to the shame.

13:49.963 --> 13:53.131
- You appeared
in all of mr. Berger's films,
miss pickford.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.866
Clearly, you knew him well.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.434
- Very well.

13:56.503 --> 14:00.605
We were planning to start
our own film studio,
owned by the artists themselves.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.373
No producers or financiers.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.309
- So why didn't you?
- With the movie business
just starting out,

14:05.378 --> 14:07.578
It would take years
to turn a profit.

14:08.548 --> 14:12.417
I needed money
to support my family.

14:12.552 --> 14:16.154
So when mr. Griffith offered me
a contract, I took it.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.455
- How did mr. Berger react?

14:19.826 --> 14:21.092
- Not well.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.027
- Did you speak to him again?

14:23.096 --> 14:25.763
- He wanted to talk
the night of the party,

14:25.765 --> 14:27.765
But I didn't see the point.

14:28.768 --> 14:31.636
- That was the last you saw him?
- Yes.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.705
I can't believe
he would do this.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.740
- If there's nothing further,
detective?

14:40.313 --> 14:41.712
(brackenreid): Ladies.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.918
Suspicious that she wouldn't say
who was in the film with her.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.988
- Well, I can understand
her embarrassment.
She seemed genuinely shocked.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.692
- She's a skilled actress;
pretending is her stock
in trade.

14:54.728 --> 14:59.196
She could've killed berger,
destroyed the film and then
still put in that performance.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.399
- Indeed, sir. Or...

15:01.401 --> 15:04.736
Someone could have killed
on miss pickford's behalf.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.212
(mary crying)

15:19.219 --> 15:23.221
- Yes, just take those two pills
a day and you'll be fine.
Come on.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.156
- Julia?

15:25.225 --> 15:27.892
- Oh! Louise.
- Do you have a moment?

15:28.027 --> 15:30.695
- Uh, a brief moment.
I'm due at the clinic.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.563
- You're hiding something.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.565
(scoffing)
- I'm not.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.767
- I know about the dead man
at the marquis theatre,

15:36.836 --> 15:40.237
And now I've just seen
mary pickford leaving
the police station.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.039
There's a connection,
isn't there?

15:42.108 --> 15:43.975
- Oh. Uh...

15:43.977 --> 15:46.177
I-I suppose there could be.

15:46.246 --> 15:50.180
- There's something
you're not telling me.
I know it.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.452
- Detective.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.588
Mr. Berger died
from a broken neck
sustained in the fall,

15:57.590 --> 16:00.191
And he had a high level
of alcohol in his bloodstream.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.792
And take a look at this.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.531
- Oh, this facial bruising
is new.
- Yes.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.834
Blood in the underlying tissue
was diffuse,

16:09.903 --> 16:13.137
Which means the blood vessels
were broken while the body
still had blood pressure.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.839
- He was hit in the face.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.942
- Shortly before he died.
- Time of death?

16:18.979 --> 16:21.312
- Between 10 p.M. And 12 a.M.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.749
If there's nothing else?

16:24.884 --> 16:26.550
- Thank you.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.353
- I'm sorry.
What are you doing?

16:29.389 --> 16:32.023
- There is no liquor licence
registered with the city.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.624
No licence, no liquor.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.861
- No, I did apply,
but I can still open
and not serve alcohol

16:36.863 --> 16:38.963
Until the licence comes through,
can I not?

16:38.965 --> 16:42.633
- You could if you didn't also
have these notices.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.436
Personal surety: $50.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.105
Inspection cost: $10.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.976
Food-service licence,
water and sewage,

16:52.111 --> 16:54.012
Signage and a few more there.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.716
- I have musicians coming
from out of town--

16:58.851 --> 17:01.319
- Then you should've followed
the rules.

17:04.791 --> 17:08.726
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see how things
are progressing.

17:08.795 --> 17:12.730
- Well, now you've seen. Happy?
- Well, it's not that bad.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.899
All you have to do is submit
the proper paperwork
and pay for the permits.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.402
- And how do you propose
I do that?

17:18.405 --> 17:21.272
Not all of us have a wealthy
meal ticket to pay our way.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.209
- That is not exactly the case--
- I'm sorry, but I'm very busy.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.688
- Obviously someone broke in
and tossed the place.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.624
Perhaps a motion-picture
aficionado.
(chuckling)

17:40.660 --> 17:43.895
- They were definitely
determined to find whatever
it was they were looking for.

17:44.030 --> 17:47.765
- Mm. I've got an idea
about what that might be.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.967
- And there were no witnesses?
- No.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.369
But I've got an idea about that,
as well.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.441
- I had to find it.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.977
You have no idea how much
that film compromises mary.

18:00.013 --> 18:03.180
- You know an awful lot
about the film.
How is that?

18:04.150 --> 18:05.583
- Because I've seen it.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.218
- Go on.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.522
- A few days ago,

18:11.591 --> 18:15.526
I received an anonymous note
regarding mary's
"best interests."

18:16.830 --> 18:19.597
- Do you have the note?
- No. I threw it away.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.401
I was told to go to an office
at king and sherbourne.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.801
- And?

18:25.872 --> 18:28.873
- I walked in,
and there was a chair...

18:28.875 --> 18:31.542
And a sheet
hanging from the wall.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.078
I sat down
and the film was projected.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.681
- Did you see anyone?
- No.

18:37.717 --> 18:41.686
And the projector was hidden
away, or I would've destroyed
that film then and there.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.388
- Did you see
who was in the film with mary?

18:45.758 --> 18:48.893
- Well,
his face wasn't on camera,
but I know who he is.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.561
It was owen moore.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.897
- Who's he?
- American actor
mary screen-tested with.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.034
She hasn't stopped talking
about him since.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.204
- What happened next?

19:00.206 --> 19:02.506
- I received a blackmail note:

19:02.542 --> 19:04.875
"pay up,
or the film goes public."

19:06.279 --> 19:08.579
- Where did you leave
the payment?
- Where I was told to.

19:10.116 --> 19:13.184
That night, I took it to the
adelaide street post office,
box 45.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.220
(background chatter)

19:22.762 --> 19:24.261
(higgins): Thank you.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.604
- Thanks.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.874
- Mr. Smith?
- What do you want?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.276
- Toronto constabulary.
You're coming with me.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.812
(sighing)

19:41.948 --> 19:45.349
- You really think
I'm blackmailing mary pickford?
(scoffing)

19:45.385 --> 19:47.351
You cops up here must be crazy.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.821
- What are you doing in toronto,
mr. Moore?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.522
- I came here to see my gal.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.791
I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.130
- And you say this isn't you
in the photograph
with mary pickford?

20:01.300 --> 20:03.501
(moore sighing)
- we haven't been that intimate.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.903
Yet.
(clearing throat)

20:06.906 --> 20:08.372
- When did you arrive
in toronto?

20:08.441 --> 20:11.175
- Two days before mary's
farewell performance.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.177
And I'd never been here before.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.046
- Your story will be checked,
mr. Moore.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.115
- Go right ahead.

20:18.151 --> 20:19.984
- We're still searching
for mr. Leavey, sir.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.253
And there was no film
in mr. Moore's hotel room.

20:22.388 --> 20:26.057
- So where the hell is it?
- The blackmailer likely has it.

20:26.192 --> 20:29.493
- Well, I suppose we can let
moore go, then.
- Sir.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.198
- Anything useful, murdoch?

20:35.235 --> 20:39.070
- Sir, if the film is intended
for blackmail,

20:39.072 --> 20:44.008
Then perhaps the man
in the photos with miss pickford
is berger's partner.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.942
- If it's not moore,
then who is it?

20:47.080 --> 20:50.214
- Well... There isn't much
to identify him by.

20:50.349 --> 20:54.418
He seems to be casting off a...
Costume of some sort.

20:55.521 --> 20:58.089
- Costume? Let me see that.
Excuse me.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.160
Bloody hell.

21:03.196 --> 21:04.828
- Sir?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.831
- Margaret's photograph.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.532
I know that costume.

21:11.537 --> 21:14.805
The man with mary pickford...
Is john.

21:23.383 --> 21:26.117
Y the hell didn't you
tell me about this, john?
- Why would I?

21:26.252 --> 21:29.620
- What? You didn't think a fling
with mary pickford
had any bearing in the case?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.421
- We kissed.
- You're in your long johns!

21:31.457 --> 21:34.658
- I must've been
getting changed!
The kiss was as far as it went.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.862
I didn't realize
we were being filmed. Otherwise,
I would've said something.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.463
- When did this happen?

21:41.134 --> 21:44.135
- Two months ago?
- Where'd it take place?
- In the green room.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.670
- Do you know what kind
of a mess you're in?
- I do now.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.673
- If you weren't my son,
you'd be a suspect in a murder!

21:49.742 --> 21:53.877
Keep your head down and,
for your mother's sake,
stay out of bloody trouble!

21:55.682 --> 21:57.615
- May I go?
- Yes.

22:06.793 --> 22:10.027
- Hey, lover boy.
You the one who's trying
to steal my gal?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.229
- Who's asking? Ah!

22:13.232 --> 22:15.399
What the heck?!
(passersby exclaiming)

22:16.636 --> 22:19.503
- Oy! Oy! Oy!
Pack it in, the pair a ya!
Idiots!

22:19.505 --> 22:23.708
I thought I told you
to stay outta trouble?
Get inside! Go on!

22:26.079 --> 22:29.447
And you,
I want you on the first train
back to new york.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.916
I don't want to see you
in toronto ever again.
Understood?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.590
- Mr. Moore.
- Who are you?

22:39.659 --> 22:41.959
- Louise cherry,
toronto telegraph.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.794
Can I offer you a cup of tea?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.567
<i> - I don't know what to do,</i>
<i> murdoch.</i>

22:49.569 --> 22:52.803
I'm worried that john's going
down the same road as bobby.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.839
If that happens, god help us.
It'll be the end of margaret.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.375
- John's a decent young man,
sir.

22:59.478 --> 23:02.146
Young women certainly
take a shine to him.

23:02.148 --> 23:06.550
- Huh. The natural brackenreid
charm is sometimes a heavy
burden to carry, murdoch.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.352
(chuckling)
- I pity you, sir.

23:08.487 --> 23:12.289
I gather dalliances
are not uncommon
amongst these theatre types.

23:12.325 --> 23:15.359
I take it you've spoken to john
of your concerns?

23:15.361 --> 23:17.495
- Well...
- Right.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.396
Given the angle of the frame...

23:20.500 --> 23:23.667
...The camera would've been...
Roughly here.

23:32.378 --> 23:33.644
Oh.

23:33.713 --> 23:37.114
- So berger filmed john and mary
from the room next door.

23:38.584 --> 23:42.052
- Huh. Seems to be
a storage room of some sort.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.753
(footsteps)

23:45.358 --> 23:47.858
- Oh. Uh...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.994
- Oh, miss halliday.
Rehearsals finished for the day?
- Oh, yes.

23:51.063 --> 23:54.131
Yes, I was just picking up
my things.
(brackenreid chuckling)

23:54.133 --> 23:56.467
- What can you tell us
about the room next door?

23:56.469 --> 23:58.869
- How do you mean?
- Is it the accent?

23:58.905 --> 24:00.437
(laughing)

24:00.473 --> 24:03.207
- Well, it used to be the
director mr. Leavey's office,

24:03.342 --> 24:04.808
And now it's a storage room.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.410
Props and such.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.246
Well, good day, gentlemen.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.482
- Leavey.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.084
Mr. Leavey was the fellow
that charlotte fired.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.220
That's a strong motive
for blackmail.

24:16.222 --> 24:19.089
- Perhaps he struck up
a partnership with mr. Berger.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.891
- Maybe the partners had
a falling out.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.033
- What are you doing here?

24:31.704 --> 24:34.705
- Something I rarely do:
Offering assistance.

24:34.707 --> 24:38.608
(chuckling)
- I don't want your charity.
- And I'm not offering it.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.047
I will help you finance
the opening of your salon
for 25% ownership.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.916
- I will just open illegally.
(hart scoffing)

24:47.353 --> 24:48.852
- And then you'll get shut down
and you'll lose everything.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.722
- At least I'll have one night
of glory.
- Don't be foolish.

24:51.791 --> 24:56.193
Perhaps you're right.
Things have been easier for me
now that I have a benefactor.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.828
I'm offering you the same.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.066
- And why only 25%?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.769
- It'll make the loss
easier to swallow.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.947
(both): Ah!

25:17.082 --> 25:18.816
- Look at this, thomas!

25:18.951 --> 25:22.686
- This about mary pickford?
- It mentions john!
- What does it say?

25:22.688 --> 25:25.455
- That he's connected
with the murder!
- That's all?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.591
- That's all?
His career will be ruined!

25:27.627 --> 25:31.294
- These things can blow over
as quick as they blew up
in the first place.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.765
- How can you be so cavalier?
This is our son
we're talking about.

25:34.834 --> 25:38.501
- Margaret, please.
- Our supposedly good son!
- That's enough.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.838
- One of us has to fix this,
thomas.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.245
- Oh, john, john, john, john...

25:48.314 --> 25:50.314
- What would you like me to do?

25:50.316 --> 25:53.183
- Speak to louise cherry.
She's like a dog with a bone.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.786
She won't let up
on this mary pickford story.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.988
Thank goodness
she didn't mention the film.

25:58.024 --> 26:00.324
If margaret were to read that
in the papers, huh!

26:00.459 --> 26:03.660
- Well, I hardly have influence
over miss cherry's behaviour.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.797
And besides, she's not the only
journalist in toronto.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.866
- She's the one with the source.

26:08.868 --> 26:11.268
John's mixed up in this.
It could ruin him.

26:11.403 --> 26:15.272
You're her friend.
If you've got a favour
to cash in, now's the time.

26:16.141 --> 26:17.808
Oh. Mar...

26:17.943 --> 26:20.010
(sighing)
margaret's not very well.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.080
- Still no word from bobby?

26:23.149 --> 26:24.615
- John's all she has.

26:26.152 --> 26:29.486
- Oh, sir!
Mr. Leavey is in the interview
room waiting for you.

26:29.555 --> 26:32.489
- You found him?
- He was in station 5's
drunk tank, sir.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.625
- Oh. Well done.
- Hmm.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.171
- Mr. Leavey.
- Ahem. Yeah.

26:47.306 --> 26:51.442
- We know that you were fired
from the marquis theatre
two months ago,

26:51.444 --> 26:54.712
And you blame
charlotte hennessey
for your dismissal.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.380
- It wasn't a question of blame.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.649
She forced the issue.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.584
She has far too much sway
over scantage.

27:01.621 --> 27:05.990
- Mr. Scantage chose
mary pickford over you,
and you wanted revenge.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.192
- Revenge is a bit strong.

27:08.327 --> 27:11.061
Let's say... Redress.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.864
- Either way,
you partnered with mr. Berger

27:13.933 --> 27:17.868
To make a compromising film
for the purpose of blackmail.

27:18.003 --> 27:19.602
- Well, you must be kidding!

27:19.639 --> 27:23.373
Oh, sure, I hated those two,
but I didn't have anything
to do with blackmail.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.212
- Where did you go
after you were escorted out
of mary pickford's party?

27:28.347 --> 27:31.148
(sighing)
- I joined friends
at a private club.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.283
I can provide names,
if you insist.

27:40.426 --> 27:44.161
(leavey sighing)
- I don't know
why you're accusing me.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.630
Scantage has far more to lose.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.501
- How so?
- He had a handshake deal
with charlotte

27:50.636 --> 27:53.237
For mary's exclusive appearance
at the marquis.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.373
He was furious
when she broke the deal
and signed with griffith.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.644
He made no secret of the fact
that he wanted revenge.

28:03.916 --> 28:07.851
- Right then, scantage...
What are you hiding?

28:11.724 --> 28:14.557
(rattling)
murdoch,
the main drawer's locked.

28:16.429 --> 28:17.961
- Allow me.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.040
Look at this.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.677
Screenplay.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.157
It's the blackmail film.

28:47.292 --> 28:51.161
- And I bet this fits box 45
at the adelaide street
post office.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.363
- If scantage
was berger's partner...

28:53.432 --> 28:56.166
- Then he's more than likely
the killer.
(footsteps)

28:58.804 --> 29:00.971
- What in god's name
are you doing here?

29:01.040 --> 29:05.208
- Mr. Scantage,
you're under arrest
for the murder of blake berger.

29:13.852 --> 29:17.187
Tage, for murder
and the blackmail.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.455
- I admit I was blackmailing
charlotte,

29:19.492 --> 29:22.125
But I was never partners
with blake berger.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.893
I swear I didn't kill him.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.763
- How did you even come
to have the film?

29:28.134 --> 29:30.100
- I'd heard that blake and mary
were making films together,

29:30.169 --> 29:34.271
And I wanted to see
what they were up to,
so I broke into blake's studio.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.606
- When was this?
- A few days ago.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.877
It was in an envelope addressed
to d.W. Griffith in new york.

29:42.714 --> 29:46.082
I figured blake was sending
a reel of his work to try
and find a job in the movies,

29:46.118 --> 29:47.483
Like mary.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.586
- You couldn't resist
a little peek.

29:49.622 --> 29:52.356
- With that film in my pocket,
I could force charlotte

29:52.491 --> 29:55.826
To pay me a share of mary's
earnings forever after.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.562
I wasn't greedy about it.
I only asked for 10%.

29:58.564 --> 30:02.566
- Generous.
- I'd earned a cut, believe me.
- How do you figure that?

30:02.568 --> 30:05.435
- I spent the last 10 years
building mary's career.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.772
She would be nowhere without me.
I made mary pickford!

30:09.942 --> 30:12.909
- So you stole the film,
sent the blackmail note,

30:12.978 --> 30:14.711
And then showed the film
to charlotte.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.513
- Yes.

30:17.550 --> 30:21.285
- Berger figured out you had
stolen it and that's why
you argued at the party.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.120
- He wanted the film back.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.790
- He wanted
to send it to griffith
in order to ruin miss pickford.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.659
- But you refused
to hand it over.

30:28.794 --> 30:31.261
You fought on the fire escape
and then you pushed him
down the stairs.

30:31.396 --> 30:34.797
- That's not what happened.
- You have yet to convince us
otherwise.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.602
(humming)

30:44.810 --> 30:47.944
- Mrs. Hart.
- May I introduce you
to mr. Steele.

30:47.980 --> 30:51.815
- It's a pleasure.
- Mr. Steele takes care
of all of our finances,

30:51.817 --> 30:53.617
Both at the home
and the restaurant.

30:53.686 --> 30:56.219
He also knows what palms
need to be greased.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.488
He'll get you open - legally.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.357
- Is that so?
- Yes.

31:00.492 --> 31:03.760
And he also has carte blanche
to dip into my account
to help you.

31:05.163 --> 31:06.629
- I'm not sure I--
- please.

31:06.665 --> 31:10.233
I want to. Besides,
what other alternative
do you have?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.904
Mr. Steele, please,
do what needs to be done.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.840
- What does your husband say
about this?

31:18.143 --> 31:20.711
- Don't worry about my husband.
I don't.

31:20.846 --> 31:22.346
(both chuckling)

31:24.717 --> 31:28.351
- Here are your permits.
You'll want to display those
properly and prominently.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.921
People like us need to follow
the law to the letter.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.123
- You've done all this?

31:33.258 --> 31:36.526
- Of course.
You're opening this weekend,
are you not?

31:36.562 --> 31:39.062
- Yes, but I didn't--
- I'll need to see
your inventory.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.830
Food, liquor, refreshments.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.000
- I don't have an inventory.

31:45.738 --> 31:48.138
- For the short term,
we'll get what we need from
mr. Carmichael's restaurant.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.074
- Have you been working
for mr. Carmichael long?

31:51.076 --> 31:53.744
- I don't work
for mr. Carmichael.
I work for mrs. Hart.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.680
- I see.
- Well, we best get to it.

31:56.749 --> 32:00.150
The worst thing a salon
could have is thirsty patrons.
Wouldn't you agree?

32:00.285 --> 32:01.818
- Yes.
(laughing)

32:03.689 --> 32:05.021
Um, so...

32:05.157 --> 32:09.026
- I-I understand
that this mary pickford story
is a real scoop--

32:09.161 --> 32:11.260
- Then why did you ask me
to drop it?

32:12.965 --> 32:16.632
- It was the briefest
of encounters and it wasn't even
that intimate!

32:17.636 --> 32:19.635
(sighing)
not that that should matter.

32:20.839 --> 32:23.440
Women in the limelight
are very vulnerable.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.976
Men can brag
about their conquests,

32:26.111 --> 32:30.313
But a woman can be ruined
by the merest hint of scandal.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.449
It's a double standard.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.651
- That's for my readers
to decide.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.188
- It would be a...
A personal favour.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.556
As a friend?

32:41.994 --> 32:43.260
- Alright.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.329
- Oh, thank you.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.264
- What were you hiding from me?

32:48.334 --> 32:50.266
- What... What do you mean?

32:51.837 --> 32:55.138
- First I thought it had
something to do with the story,
but it didn't.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.341
You are lying to me
about something,

32:57.476 --> 33:01.010
And I want to know what it is -
as a friend.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.149
- If you must know...

33:07.486 --> 33:09.019
I'm expecting.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.820
- Oh!

33:10.889 --> 33:12.889
(laughing)

33:13.025 --> 33:14.558
Sorry.
(laughing)

33:15.360 --> 33:16.626
Julia, congratulations.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.294
- Thank you.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.963
- You could've just told me.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.900
- I... I feared you might...

33:23.969 --> 33:25.502
Write about it.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.438
- Write about it? I would never.
You're not that famous.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.240
(laughter)

33:30.375 --> 33:33.443
- William. Oh.
This is the film, I take it?

33:33.512 --> 33:35.845
- Indeed. I'm about to watch it.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.981
- Oh, dear.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.184
- Well, it is evidence.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.787
- I don't need to see
any of my son's performance.

33:43.856 --> 33:47.190
- Well, sir, we need
at least two people
to attest to its contents.

33:47.325 --> 33:50.794
- Well, I'll leave you
and the good doctor to it, then.
Enjoy.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.929
- Oh. Ah. Alright.

33:54.967 --> 33:56.466
- Right, then.

34:05.143 --> 34:06.843
- Not exactly scandalous.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.913
- Scintillating.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.350
- Oh, my!

34:14.352 --> 34:17.020
- There's something
eminently distasteful

34:17.155 --> 34:20.356
About the filming of people
in amorous congress.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.791
- Mm.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.563
- This is definitely
more intimate than they claimed.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.698
- Yeah.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.302
Oh! Oh.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.872
Is there much more?

34:35.908 --> 34:38.909
- I... Hmm, um...
(ogden exclaiming softly)

34:39.044 --> 34:41.578
- Well, that was particularly
unpleasant.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.980
- I'd like to watch it again.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.682
- William!

34:45.751 --> 34:47.783
- Oh, n-not that part.

34:47.820 --> 34:52.122
Before john enters,
there's a jump in the frame.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.857
- A jump?

34:53.926 --> 34:55.258
- Yes.

34:56.095 --> 34:57.593
Ahem.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.334
There. Did you see that?

35:04.403 --> 35:06.803
- Yeah. Huh!
- Yes. A-a-and then,

35:06.872 --> 35:11.608
After that,
we never quite see mary's face
clearly again.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.210
- Meaning what?

35:13.345 --> 35:17.614
- Meaning I believe
john brackenreid hasn't been
entirely honest with us.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.555
- Well, this is very
embarrassing.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.825
- So this is you
with mary pickford, then.
- Yes.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.229
- Is there a chance--
- wait.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.766
No.
No, we never went this far.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.569
It's not mary. Her ankle...

35:39.571 --> 35:42.972
Mary has a scar on her ankle
from a childhood
bicycling accident.

35:43.041 --> 35:46.042
- If it's not mary, john,
then who is it?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.646
- Um, susan.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.181
Mary's understudy.

35:52.751 --> 35:56.920
- Miss halliday served
as the understudy
in the green room, as well?

35:56.989 --> 36:02.192
- I may have had a more...
Intimate dalliance with susan.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.993
A number of times.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.528
- Oh.

36:10.936 --> 36:14.171
So mr. Berger filmed you
and susan halliday,

36:14.306 --> 36:19.342
Then added clips
of mary pickford
in the same costume.

36:20.913 --> 36:22.879
- That photo you showed me
earlier, that must've been
susan, as well.

36:23.014 --> 36:27.350
- So berger took advantage
of susan halliday...

36:27.352 --> 36:31.554
And created
a fake blackmail film...

36:31.557 --> 36:33.023
Of mary pickford.

36:33.858 --> 36:34.925
Oh.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.394
- I suppose my father will hear
about this?

36:39.831 --> 36:43.099
- Your father will hear
that you were very helpful,
john.

36:44.502 --> 36:45.701
Ahem.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.041
Blake berger secretly filmed
susan halliday,

36:52.110 --> 36:54.377
Compromising her considerably.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.646
- Well, that's motive for murder
right there.

36:56.781 --> 37:00.584
- If I can prove that she's seen
the film, then she's added
to the list of suspects.

37:02.054 --> 37:05.821
I've identified four sets
of fingermarks on the canister.

37:07.526 --> 37:10.593
Including myself,
there's blake berger,

37:10.596 --> 37:12.094
Edwin scantage...

37:13.798 --> 37:15.865
...And susan halliday.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.768
- What he did... Was criminal.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.239
How could he defile me...

37:24.276 --> 37:26.009
...Filming me like that?

37:27.612 --> 37:30.080
Blake's known me
since I was a child.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.950
- When did you find
mr. Berger's film?

37:36.355 --> 37:38.621
- After everyone left,

37:38.624 --> 37:43.159
I went to mr. Scantage's office
to peek at the script
for a new play he's producing.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.563
That's where I found the film.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.965
- Why didn't you simply take it?

37:49.701 --> 37:51.367
- Blake walked in.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.839
I was so angry, I dropped it.

37:55.974 --> 38:00.043
- And you knew he was the one
who had made it?
- Who else?

38:00.712 --> 38:02.011
He's the filmmaker.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.549
I... Flew at him.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.785
Hit him, slapped him.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.489
How could he do that to me?

38:15.527 --> 38:19.595
- You chased him out
onto the fire escape
and pushed him down the stairs.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.864
- No.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.268
I was angry. I hit him.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.670
But he lost his balance
and he...

38:28.473 --> 38:29.772
...He started to fall backwards.

38:31.143 --> 38:34.811
I grabbed his jacket to try
and save him, but it-it ripped,

38:34.880 --> 38:38.681
And... I couldn't stop him
from falling.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.418
I did not push him
down those stairs.

38:42.454 --> 38:46.389
I swear on my mother's grave,
it was an accident!

38:48.560 --> 38:50.960
But after using me like that...

38:55.367 --> 38:56.900
...He had it coming.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.575
- Mrs. Hennessey?

39:05.644 --> 39:08.244
I'm margaret brackenreid.
Uh, john's mother.

39:08.246 --> 39:09.779
- Oh! Yes.
- Yes.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.915
Uh, our children
were scandalized
by that awful article.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.584
- Awful?

39:14.653 --> 39:17.120
Oh, I think
it was terrific publicity.

39:17.189 --> 39:20.322
The public loves to read about
the private lives of actors.

39:20.359 --> 39:23.492
- Well, I had a publicity idea
of my own.

39:23.528 --> 39:27.464
A circle of fans who pay
for photos and news.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.064
A... A club of sorts.

39:29.101 --> 39:32.334
- A circle of fans?
It's a fascinating idea.

39:32.371 --> 39:35.238
- You think so?
- Yes. It's terrific.

39:36.741 --> 39:38.741
I'm going to make a start of it
as soon as we get to new york.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.543
- Oh, goodness. Thank you.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.213
- Thank you, margaret.
- Good luck, mary.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.481
You're going places.
I just know it.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.284
- I don't know where I'd be
without you, john.

39:48.353 --> 39:49.852
Take care of yourself.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.391
- See you in the movies.
- Mm.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.830
- I spoke to the crown.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.698
He thinks that,
under the circumstances,

40:02.700 --> 40:04.968
They'll be lenient
with miss halliday's sentence.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.569
- That's good news.
- Mm.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.238
- She didn't deserve
any of this.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.674
- Your mother seems happy.
- Yes.

40:11.676 --> 40:14.344
I'm glad she's taking interest
in my career.

40:14.479 --> 40:17.313
Although now she wants me
signing photos of myself.

40:17.382 --> 40:19.182
(chuckling)
- just go with it, john.

40:19.317 --> 40:22.252
Peace in the valley
and all that. Do you understand
what I'm saying?

40:22.254 --> 40:23.720
- I suppose.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.722
- And let's not mention anything
about all this to her.
It's for the best.

40:26.724 --> 40:29.392
(john): Yes, for the best.
- Thank you.

40:31.062 --> 40:34.063
- "see you in the movies."
that's my boy.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.432
(chuckling)

40:42.006 --> 40:44.573
- Julia, shall we?
- Just one moment.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.548
Inspector. Thomas.

40:51.683 --> 40:55.384
- Ah. What can I do for you,
doctor? Julia.
(chuckling)

40:55.454 --> 40:59.088
- William and I have some news
we'd like to share with you.

41:00.192 --> 41:02.492
- We do?
Are-are you quite sure?

41:02.494 --> 41:04.026
- I'm sure. You tell him.

41:05.563 --> 41:08.297
- Well, sir,
it's rather exciting news.

41:08.333 --> 41:11.667
- Well, get on with it, murdoch.
I've got work to do.
- We're having a baby.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.638
- Really?
- Really.
(laughter)

41:15.640 --> 41:19.041
- I thought you'd just been
eating more than usual.
(laughter)

41:19.110 --> 41:21.911
That's the happiest news of all,
william! Congratulations!

41:21.980 --> 41:24.847
- Oh, thank you.
- We wanted you to be the first
to know.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.349
- I'm honoured.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.785
I couldn't be happier
for both of you. Oh.
(laughter)

41:30.355 --> 41:33.856
Now, then, this is one occasion
that deserves scotch.
(laughing)

41:35.293 --> 41:37.860
- I don't think I can--
- been having any cravings,
doctor?

41:37.896 --> 41:42.131
- Pickles. Lots of pickles.
Difficult to find at night.
(ogden laughing)

41:42.200 --> 41:44.934
- Oh, right.
(indistinct chatter)

41:44.970 --> 41:47.703
(up-tempo music)
(lively background chatter)

42:04.022 --> 42:06.222
(indistinct chatter)
(laughter)

42:11.863 --> 42:14.297
- A roaring success.
- Yes, so far!

42:15.000 --> 42:16.298
And all thanks to you.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.902
- My pleasure.
And mr. Steele, as well.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.502
- Yes. And...

42:20.539 --> 42:22.538
Thank you, mr. Carmichael.

42:22.607 --> 42:24.440
It's lovely to meet you.

42:24.442 --> 42:27.710
- You, as well.
- I was thinking
you were a rumour.

42:27.779 --> 42:31.848
(laughter)
- we do let him out
from time to time.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.849
(laughter)
- now, remember, it's toronto.

42:33.919 --> 42:35.785
No dancing after 10.

42:35.787 --> 42:38.654
- Oh, right.
- And you are the owner,
are you not?

42:39.858 --> 42:42.525
- Yes.
- No serving drinks.
You are the hostess.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.226
The lady of the house.

42:44.296 --> 42:47.063
Arthur, behind the bar, please.

42:47.132 --> 42:49.599
- Of course. Miss, may I?

42:54.005 --> 42:55.338
- Thank you.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.610
- Thank you, arthur.
- My pleasure.

43:00.679 --> 43:03.278
- Mr. Steele,
would you like to join us?

43:03.315 --> 43:05.914
- Uh, I'd be pleased.
(laughter)

43:25.837 --> 43:29.038
- Well, would you look at that.
Pleasure all around.

43:29.173 --> 43:31.173
What a wonderful start
to the evening.

44:07.712 --> 44:09.645
Subtitling: Difuze
