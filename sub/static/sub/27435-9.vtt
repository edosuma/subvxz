01:57.310 --> 01:58.868
REDDINGTON:
A serial blackmailer.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.741
He takes his name
from the villain

02:00.780 --> 02:03.681
in Edgar Allan Poe's
The Purloined Letter.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.415
However, unlike his namesake,

02:05.450 --> 02:07.179
this man's
never been identified.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.517
Why now?

02:08.560 --> 02:10.289
Today of all days?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.752
Because I'm innocent.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.724
And he can prove it.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.897
How?

02:14.930 --> 02:18.422
The explanation
will be obvious _
once you've found hIm.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.961
But as my trial begins
within the hour,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.901
I'd appreciate it
if you would investigate now

02:23.940 --> 02:25.532
and ask questions later.

02:25.570 --> 02:28.607
You say this Minister D
can prove your innocence.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.278
Can he also prove
who's guilty?

02:30.310 --> 02:31.299
Yes.

02:32.180 --> 02:34.045
So you know
who the real traitor is?

02:34.080 --> 02:35.570
Someone I trusted.

02:35.620 --> 02:40.250
As is the traitor
who turned _me
In to the police.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.053
Have you found out
who that is yet?

02:42.090 --> 02:43.455
Someone close.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.922
Traitors always are.

02:48.330 --> 02:51.322
Tell me about Minister D.

02:51.370 --> 02:54.897
According to Reddington,
Minister D gathers
incriminating information

02:54.940 --> 02:57.067
and then uses it
to extort people.

02:57.110 --> 03:01.069
In 2004, he discovered
an insider trading scheme

03:01.110 --> 03:04.238
and used the information
to extort $4 million

03:04.280 --> 03:06.771
from a pair of traders
at Koji Analytics.

03:06.820 --> 03:10.483
Six years ago, he blackmailed
Senator Constance Holsted

03:10.520 --> 03:12.659
after finding proof
of a kickback scheme

03:12.690 --> 03:14.510
between the senator's husband

03:14.560 --> 03:16.289
and a major
real-estate developer.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.649
PETER: It's
about the body.

03:17.690 --> 03:19.021
MIKELA:_ What are
you talking about?

03:19.060 --> 03:21.494
Where we put
iﬁmtwm.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.998
COOPER: Did Reddington say how
Minister D collects his intel?

03:24.030 --> 03:26.590
LIZ: No. But he made
it seem as if he has

03:26.640 --> 03:29.268
compromising information
on just about everyone.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.631
Which is why Reddington
brought us the case.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.978
What do you mean?

03:33.010 --> 03:35.899
Minister D gathers information
to extort people.

03:35.940 --> 03:38.204
With Reddington about to go
to trial, it stands to reason

03:38.250 --> 03:42.038
that he wants
to extort members
of the jury or the judge.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.048
Maybe he thinks the Minister
can help with that.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.285
It's a rislq move
if he believes he's innocent.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.958
Which we all know
he's not.

03:47.990 --> 03:49.150
Do we?

03:49.190 --> 03:50.953
_ You think
Reddington IS Innocent?

03:50.990 --> 03:52.992
I think this guy could be.
This "guy"?

03:53.030 --> 03:55.692
I think_what Ressler
IS tryIng to say...

03:55.730 --> 03:57.789
SAMAR: Yes, please translate.
...is, we won't know the truth

03:57.830 --> 03:59.388
until we find the Minister.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.567
Did Reddington give
any indication where
to start?

04:01.600 --> 04:03.500
Yes.
With Sayantan Shah.

04:03.540 --> 04:05.360
The Taxi Tycoon?
In 2006,

04:05.410 --> 04:07.970
Reddington loaned him money
to pay off a blackmailer

04:08.010 --> 04:09.671
he believes was Minister D.

04:10.510 --> 04:13.377
Talk to Shah.
See what he knows.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.241
He loaned me money.
I paid him back.
Is that a crime?

04:16.290 --> 04:19.214
To do business
with a wanted fugitive
and not report it?

04:19.250 --> 04:20.615
Yeah. That's a
whole lot of crimes.

04:21.890 --> 04:23.585
I was being blackmailed.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.552
I didn't have the money.
What was I supposed to do?

04:25.590 --> 04:27.023
I can't just walk
into a bank.

04:27.060 --> 04:30.166
Relax, Mr. Shah.
We're not here
to arrest you.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.691
Or to ask you to cooperate
against Mr. Reddington.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.867
We don't need your help
to make a case against him.

I was being blackmailed...

04:49.050 --> 04:50.085
You'll ignore those, too?

04:50.120 --> 04:51.587
RESSLER: Our interest
is Minister D.

04:51.620 --> 04:55.158

we'll look past
your little indiscretions.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.185
I came to my office
one day after lunch,

04:59.230 --> 05:01.892
and there was this envelope.

05:01.930 --> 05:05.195
Inside was a transcript
of a phone call I had made

05:05.230 --> 05:08.097
detailing certain
business arrangements

05:08.140 --> 05:10.836

was word for word.

to locate it as we speak.

06:00.190 --> 06:03.489
By "investigators," I can
only assume defense counsel

06:03.530 --> 06:05.782
means his very own team

Mr. Sima may not appreciate
that an ancillary benefit

of catching said criminal
is that he is in possession

see a continuance

for a just outcome.

were you familiar with

involving the USS. Gideon
in March of 1990?

14:28.430 --> 14:29.920
RESSLER: I was. Yes.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.768
The U.S.S. Gideon
was an Ohio-class submarine

14:32.800 --> 14:34.233
sunk by the Soviet Navy

14:34.270 --> 14:36.465
while on a secret mission
in the Barents Sea.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.936
134 men were on board.
They all died.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.868
SIMA: You say
it was a secret mission.

14:41.910 --> 14:44.003
How did the Soviet Naw
find out about it?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.939
Because Raymond Reddington
told them.

14:46.980 --> 14:50.609
Was the defendant the only one
who knew about the mission?

14:50.650 --> 14:53.687
Raymond Reddington
was one of 16 people
who were aware Of it.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.520
12 Naval Officers
and four CIA operatives
on the Russia desk.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.449
SIMA: If 16 people were
aware of the mission,

15:00.500 --> 15:03.799
how can you be sure
the defendant was
the informant?

15:03.830 --> 15:05.969
Two days
before the sub was attacked,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.867
the Gideon's captain changed
course to avoid weather.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.539
The Change was communicated
to an intelligence Officer

15:11.570 --> 15:13.174
who was assigned
to the mission.

15:13.210 --> 15:16.008
He was the only one of the 16
who knew the coordinates

15:16.040 --> 15:18.440
Of the sub
on the day in question.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.516
Who was
that intelligence officer?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.369
Raymond Reddington.

15:22.420 --> 15:25.480
So, the defendant
was the only one

15:25.520 --> 15:28.011
who knew the location
Of the submarine.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.949
That doesn't prove he told
the Russians how to find it.

15:30.990 --> 15:32.582
Why are you so certain
that he did?

15:32.630 --> 15:36.259
Because a secure
KGB communique we intercepted

15:36.300 --> 15:37.927
indicated
that Raymond Reddington

15:37.970 --> 15:40.564
provided the Russians
with the exact coordinates

was torpedoed.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.115
Is it because
you're uncertain?

19:14.150 --> 19:17.483
_ _ Or aware
Of mitigating Circumstances

19:17.520 --> 19:20.318
that have given you
a different Opinion of me?

19:20.360 --> 19:24.148
About who I am today
as opposed to who I once was?

19:24.190 --> 19:25.828
I don't think
you want me to answer that.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.327
Oh, but I do.
I don't.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.123
Counsel will approach.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.220

the moment, Agent Ressler.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.794
(CLEARS THROAT)

19:35.470 --> 19:38.507

played in my courtroom.

19:38.540 --> 19:39.802
Especially dirty ones.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.637
He hesitated for a reason.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.069
_ The reason
is that you work together,

19:44.110 --> 19:46.476
a fact that is
not admissible
at this trial.

19:46.510 --> 19:49.115
Or have you forgotten
that your cozy relationship
with the FBI

19:49.150 --> 19:51.584
is a deep, dark,
and regrettable secret?

19:51.620 --> 19:53.178
There's something else.

19:53.220 --> 19:56.314
Well, I hope for your
sake that it doesn't
involve Rostova.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.783
Because that fishing
expedition is over.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.320
I need more time.

20:00.360 --> 20:03.295
Clearly.
But you don't have it.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.373

Of warm shoes, and $3,000.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.844

you can help me or not.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.717
It was a White woman.
Dark hair.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.887
She didn't give me
her name.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.956
Just 100 bucks to call 911

20:28.990 --> 20:31.185
and to say I seen
a man with a gun.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.050
_ A man
wearing a SUit and hat.

20:33.090 --> 20:35.297

That's not her.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.395
Take your time.
Are you sure?

20:38.430 --> 20:40.830
She gave me 100 bucks
to make a phone call.

20:40.870 --> 20:42.394
I'm never gonna forget
her face.

forget yours.

20:49.510 --> 20:52.206
I'm a retired forensic
accountant with the FBI.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.548
SIMA: When you were
with the Bureau,
did you discover

20:54.580 --> 20:57.708
that the Russians
paid Raymond Reddington

20:57.750 --> 21:00.685
for information
leading to the sinking

21:00.720 --> 21:02.881
Of the U.S.S._Gideon?
Yes, Sir.

21:02.920 --> 21:06.526
I would object,
but I so enjoy a good yarn.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.721
Describe how the money
was handled.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.193
A month before the incident,

21:10.230 --> 21:13.358
a corporate account
was opened in a Cypriot bank

21:13.400 --> 21:16.062
known to work
with Soviet intelligence.

21:16.100 --> 21:19.729
The only person with
the power to Withdraw funds
was the company president.

21:19.770 --> 21:21.032
And who was that?

21:22.580 --> 21:24.502
Raymond Reddington.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.347
SIMA: I'm sure many
accounts were opened

21:26.380 --> 21:28.871
in the weeks prior
to the tragedy Of the Gideon.

21:28.920 --> 21:32.788
What makes you think
the activity in this account
was connected to it?

21:32.820 --> 21:34.685
Because a front company
for the KGB

21:34.720 --> 21:36.585
Wired $3 million
into the account

21:36.620 --> 21:38.121
a day before the incident,

21:38.160 --> 21:40.458
and another $3 million
the day after it.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.923
One week later, the entire
amount was Withdrawn.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.166
By Reddington?

21:44.870 --> 21:46.394
Yes.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.069
Using fingerprints
and a password.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.068
Thank you.
No further questions.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.066
Was the Withdrawal
made in person?

21:53.110 --> 21:55.305
No.
It was a Wire transfer.

21:55.340 --> 21:57.979
You said the Withdrawal
required fingerprints
and a password.

21:58.010 --> 21:59.477
It was done remotely.

21:59.510 --> 22:02.240
So if someone had a copy
Of my fingerprints

22:02.280 --> 22:04.885
and knew the password,
they could have made
the Withdrawal,

22:04.920 --> 22:06.342
and no one at the bank,
nor yourself,

22:06.390 --> 22:07.482
would have known
the difference?

22:07.520 --> 22:10.421
I, uh, suppose
that's possible.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.428
Yes. You know
What else is possible?

22:12.460 --> 22:14.724
That I was framed
by Katarina Rostova,

22:14.760 --> 22:16.057
which I could prove
if Your Honor

22:16.100 --> 22:17.328
would grant me
even the shortest...

22:17.370 --> 22:19.497
All right, the court
will stand in recess.

22:19.530 --> 22:21.134
During which time
I will consider

22:21.170 --> 22:23.809
Whether your willful disregard
for my instruction

22:23.840 --> 22:27.401
suggests that While you
are clearly competent
to stand trial,

22:27.440 --> 22:30.273
you may be incompetent
to represent yourself.
I'm innocent.

22:30.310 --> 22:33.416
HOW can trying to prove that
suggest incompetence?

22:33.450 --> 22:34.678
It doesn't.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.312
But not following
the rules does.

22:36.350 --> 22:38.511
And so far, you haven't
come close to doing that.

on December 7, 1990.

we'll find it.

you give it to us?

represent himself
in a death penalty case.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.826
Mr. Reddington
made the choice,

25:33.860 --> 25:35.657
and, after
careful consideration,

25:35.700 --> 25:38.863
I have decided to allow him
to continue down that path.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.095
As he's acting
as his own counsel,

25:41.140 --> 25:43.495
he may testify
in a narrative form.

the benefit of the doubt.

Don't make me regret it.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.342

Is it possible
he got the date wrong?

for a very specific needle
in this haystack.

taken on December 7, 1990.

26:27.580 --> 26:28.877

you found something.

We did. Just not
What we were looking for.

ARAM: Elijah Bailey
is an alias.

to a Jordan Loving,

a retired corporal
in the Army Corps
Of Engineers.

26:38.430 --> 26:42.093
Now, he disappeared
from a hospital four days
after he made the recording

26:42.130 --> 26:43.893
that Mr. Reddington says
will clear his name.

26:43.930 --> 26:45.727

with severe burns

26:45.770 --> 26:47.419
after an explosion
at his house injured him

26:47.470 --> 26:49.597
and killed a man identified
as Zachary Tempkin.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.699
We found this picture
at Bailey's.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.298
SAMAR: It can't be
a coincidence
that Reddington

26:53.340 --> 26:55.604
is looking for a recording
made on December 7th,

26:55.640 --> 26:58.939
and, on December 11th,
an assassin injures Bailey

26:58.980 --> 27:01.710
and murders a man who appears
to have been his lover.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.718
Maybe he used the tape
to try and blackmail

27:03.750 --> 27:05.889
someone who didn't take kindly
to being blackmailed.

27:05.920 --> 27:09.515
But who? And how the hell
is it connected to Reddington?

27:09.560 --> 27:14.395
REDDINGTON: 35 years ago,
a Naval intelligence officer

27:14.430 --> 27:17.399
working for
the US. government fell...

27:21.640 --> 27:28.637
Fell into a relationship
With_a beautiful
RUSSlan woman.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.978
Unbeknownst to his superiors,

27:31.010 --> 27:37.939
that relationship,
which started _
as guarded attraction,

27:39.320 --> 27:41.515
quickly evolved into passion,

27:41.560 --> 27:44.950
which resulted in pregnancy.

27:48.830 --> 27:51.264
They had the child.

27:51.300 --> 27:54.235
A girl,

27:54.270 --> 27:56.761
Whom they both loved.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.806
What the Naval officer
didn't know,

28:03.850 --> 28:08.173
but certainly
should have suspected,

28:08.880 --> 28:12.589
was that the Russian woman

28:12.620 --> 28:17.956
was a KGB Officer,

28:17.990 --> 28:22.825
that Katarina Rostova
had been assigned

28:22.860 --> 28:26.626
to get close
to Raymond Reddington

28:26.670 --> 28:29.230
and steal
classified information
from him.

28:30.300 --> 28:34.031
What Reddington
could never have suspected

28:34.080 --> 28:37.709
was that though
she was a KGB agent,

28:37.750 --> 28:41.868
Rostova's real handlers
were members

28:41.920 --> 28:45.219
_ _Ofa secret _
criminal organization,

28:45.250 --> 28:51.189

28:51.230 --> 28:55.929
to manipulate
world governments,
economic markets,

28:55.960 --> 29:00.659
trade,
and international alliances.

29:00.700 --> 29:04.659
When Reddington
discovered this,

29:04.710 --> 29:06.860
he confronted Rostova,

29:06.910 --> 29:10.505
who warned him that
if he threatened
to expose them,

29:10.540 --> 29:14.840
the Cabal would destroy
his reputation,

29:14.880 --> 29:19.283
discrediting him
so he could not
discredit them.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.353
And that's What happened.

29:24.090 --> 29:27.082
With the help Of the Cabal,

29:27.130 --> 29:29.690
Rostova framed Reddington

29:29.730 --> 29:34.064
with the very evidence
you've heard
in this courtroom.

29:35.870 --> 29:40.159
TO prevent him
from protecting his country,

29:40.210 --> 29:43.304
she made it appear
as if he had betrayed it.

29:45.310 --> 29:49.940
As a result, the Cabal
remained in the shadows,

29:49.980 --> 29:53.108
Rostova disappeared,

29:53.150 --> 29:57.154
and Raymond Reddington
became...

30:00.090 --> 30:03.594
...a completely
different person.

30:21.350 --> 30:26.515
but not a single one ever

30:26.550 --> 30:28.381
that was treasonous.

That's it,

enlighten me

31:48.700 --> 31:50.964

his FBI lackey

31:51.010 --> 31:52.238
just stepped and fetched
for him...

31:52.270 --> 31:53.737
It's a tape recording.

31:53.770 --> 31:56.034
That we haven't had
the chance to authenticate.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.298
Then let's get Agent Ressler
to hop on the stand,

31:58.350 --> 32:00.739
cross his heart, hope to die,
and do just that.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.179
I agree.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.869
Mr. Sima,
you will have the chance

32:03.920 --> 32:06.582
to cross-examine the Witness
and authenticate the tape.

32:06.620 --> 32:10.010
Mr. Reddington, it appears
that all your eggs
are in this basket.

32:10.060 --> 32:11.880
You better hope
they don't crack.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.649

32:18.930 --> 32:21.262

copied to a flash drive,

32:21.300 --> 32:24.736

32:28.880 --> 32:30.768
He knows everything.
Explain.

32:30.810 --> 32:32.209
He's discovered my identity.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.115
And the existence
Of the Cabal.

32:34.150 --> 32:35.572
Can he be contained?

32:35.620 --> 32:37.178
He took Masha.

32:37.220 --> 32:38.619

32:38.650 --> 32:40.208
He's a decorated officer.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.854
His death
would be investigated.

32:41.890 --> 32:44.120
Whatever they find,
they will believe.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.025
But if we discredit him...

32:46.060 --> 32:48.893
The intelligence I stole...
We leak that it came from him.

32:48.930 --> 32:50.898
No one will believe him
after that.

Not with the blood
Of 134 Americans
on his hands.

32:54.070 --> 32:57.233
Agent Rostova, I told you
to eliminate him.

32:57.270 --> 32:59.534
And I'm telling you
there's a better way.

32:59.570 --> 33:01.128
Because you're
sleeping with him.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.899
Because he has proof
that the Cabal exists,

in the event of his death.

33:33.770 --> 33:36.000
Why did you bring me
this tape?

33:36.040 --> 33:37.928

has a legal Obligation

33:40.810 --> 33:43.938
with any exculpatory
