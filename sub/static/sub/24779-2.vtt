13:20.508 --> 13:22.718
She went nuclear on some troll.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.455
I always thought you didn't like me.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.708
I didn't. At all.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.586
And oddly, having fun with you now

13:57.670 --> 13:59.463
makes me like you even less.

14:00.130 --> 14:03.259
You  Pastiche  cats, man,

how racism works

14:51.056 --> 14:54.476

14:56.478 --> 14:57.771
I'm gonna get a cigarette
