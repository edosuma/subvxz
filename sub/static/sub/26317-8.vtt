WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.786
Previously onSWAT...Made an aggressive lane change

00:03.829 --> 00:05.396
back there.
Pop the trunk.

00:05.440 --> 00:08.486
Officer, you can't check my car
without probable cause.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.618
Just pop your trunk.

00:09.661 --> 00:10.923
That fool had the nerve to act

00:10.967 --> 00:12.186
like I was the one making it
about race.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.623
And?And...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.715
Didn't you learn anything
while you were on the team?

00:19.758 --> 00:21.325
If it were up to me,
you would not be in the academy.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.414
You had your spot,
and you threw it away.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.981
We both agree
we want you back

00:25.025 --> 00:26.026
on SWAT on a probationary basis.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.376
[laughs] Really?Yes.

00:28.419 --> 00:29.725
KIRA: There's something
that I need to be honest

00:29.768 --> 00:30.987
with you about.
I do have a fiancÃ©,

00:31.031 --> 00:33.163
and we've been looking

00:33.207 --> 00:34.947
for a new third to complete us.

00:34.991 --> 00:38.386
I'm not into being a prop
for other people's fantasies.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.388
It's about so much more
than sex for us.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.346
We're interested
in a real partner.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.616
Nia, listen, uh...

00:51.660 --> 00:56.404
I called the hotel in Tucson to
take care of those damages,

00:56.447 --> 00:58.449
but they told me you
had already covered it.

00:58.493 --> 01:01.844
Look, I'm the one who put
that lamp in the wall,

01:01.887 --> 01:04.586
so there's no way I'm gonna
let you pay for my behavior.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.067
Angry as you were, it could've
been more than just a lamp.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.852
Yeah, I guess, but...

01:09.895 --> 01:11.854
that's not who I am, Nia.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.160
That's not the way
my mama raised me.

01:15.292 --> 01:18.295
I just wanted to let you know
that I took care of it, so...

01:18.339 --> 01:20.558
we can stop talking about it.

01:20.602 --> 01:23.213
I'm not the one who started
this conversation.

01:24.954 --> 01:28.523
But if you ask me...

01:28.566 --> 01:30.525
you needed it.

01:30.568 --> 01:33.223
And you can stop thinking
about it all you want.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.007
Doesn't make it go away.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.401
I'll keep that in mind.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.975
Hey, you.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.411
Hey.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.022
I thought I was early.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.764
I was in a hurry to see you.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.811
We saw each other
just last night.I know.

01:55.854 --> 01:59.075
I think I remember
how you like it. The coffee.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.427
Perfect.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.864
[chuckles softly]

02:05.908 --> 02:08.476
So, where's Ty?

02:08.519 --> 02:09.999
It's been a couple
weeks since it's been

02:10.042 --> 02:11.566
just the two of us.

02:11.609 --> 02:14.177
That's on purpose, actually.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.874
I thought

02:15.918 --> 02:19.530
you'd know enough
about Ty and us by now

02:19.574 --> 02:22.185
to know if you wanted
to date us for real.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.056
If Ty's the issue,

02:24.100 --> 02:25.928
I want you to feel
comfortable saying that.No.

02:25.971 --> 02:29.453
Ty's great, and I totally get
why you're marrying him.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.631
I understand the...

02:33.675 --> 02:35.633
polyamorous thing
a lot better now.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.291
I'm open to the idea.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.816
But...?

02:44.860 --> 02:47.950
I can't believe I'm saying this,

02:47.993 --> 02:50.779
but I'm actually worried
about what people will think.

02:50.822 --> 02:54.739
They'll think you refuse
to let societal norms keep you

02:54.783 --> 02:57.307
from a fulfilling relationship.They'll definitely
not be thinking that.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.657
Look, Chris,
you're the only one

02:59.701 --> 03:01.572
I can see us being with.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.618
But if you're not comfortable
with it now,

03:03.661 --> 03:05.663
do you think you ever will be?

03:08.971 --> 03:10.625
[indistinct chatter]

03:16.413 --> 03:19.068
JESSICA: So, this girl made
a million dollars last year?

03:19.111 --> 03:22.332
$1.3 million.Just talking about
herself online?

03:22.376 --> 03:25.814
Without any kind of real talent?

03:25.857 --> 03:28.077
Well, when you say it like that,
it makes it sound silly.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.775
It sounds silly no
matter how you say it.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.778
So, this girl...

03:33.822 --> 03:36.390
Tiffany. She's the most
inspiring lifestyle vlogger

03:36.433 --> 03:38.827
on the Internet.Inspiring?

03:38.870 --> 03:41.960
She videos herself
trying on new outfits.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.224
And now she's famous,
and everyone loves her.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.617
There's worse ways
of making a living.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.445
Please tell me
you're gonna go to college.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.273
I think I'd be good at it.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.754
There's a girl that has
20,000 followers at my school,

03:52.797 --> 03:54.582
and I'm better than her.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.888
Does my sister know
about this plan of yours?

03:56.932 --> 03:59.108
Thanks for getting up
at 4:00 a.m. for this.

03:59.151 --> 04:03.373
How else am I gonna maintain
my status as the cool aunt?

04:03.417 --> 04:04.766
[microphone feedback screeches]WOMAN:
Hello, everybody!

04:04.809 --> 04:07.725
[cheering]

04:07.769 --> 04:09.161
So, uh,

04:09.205 --> 04:11.599
Tiffany is still running
a little late.

04:11.642 --> 04:14.210
GIRL: What?She's on her way, I promise.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.734
But how would you like
to video chat

04:16.778 --> 04:19.781
with my favorite little sister
right now?

04:19.824 --> 04:22.436
[cheering]

04:22.479 --> 04:24.568
My people.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.440
Y'all enjoying my house?

04:26.483 --> 04:28.790
Mi casa, your casa.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.922
Someone needs to
teach her Spanish.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.141
Oh, and JD's here, too.

04:32.184 --> 04:33.969
What up, experiencers?

04:34.012 --> 04:35.144
[chuckles]

04:35.187 --> 04:37.538
I'm so sorry I'm late.

04:37.581 --> 04:40.410
I'm sure Sarah told you
that I was in San Diego

04:40.454 --> 04:42.020
visiting a fan,
just like you guys.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.761
Love you guys!

04:43.805 --> 04:45.720
Her name's Kourtney,
and she's in the hospital.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.939
She's real sick.

04:47.983 --> 04:50.028
We went down there and filmed
a video with Kourtney,

04:50.072 --> 04:52.422
and you'll never believe where
I got this hat I'm wearing.

04:52.466 --> 04:53.771
That's in the video, too,

04:53.815 --> 04:55.991
and we'll post that tomorrow,
so look for it.

04:56.034 --> 04:59.081
One day I'm gonna be riding
back and forth in a helicopter,

04:59.124 --> 05:01.562
but until then I'm stuck
on the 405 like everybody else.

05:01.605 --> 05:04.042
Love you guys![cheering]

05:05.740 --> 05:07.089
She's so great.

05:07.132 --> 05:08.917
[gunshots]

05:08.960 --> 05:10.919
[screaming]

05:10.962 --> 05:13.225
LAPD! Everyone out
through the back!

05:13.269 --> 05:14.618
Keep going.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.054
You, come here.
You guys, go.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.535
Okay, it's okay. I'll call 911.Tell them

05:18.579 --> 05:20.058
Captain Cortez is here,
tell them what I'm wearing,

05:20.102 --> 05:22.234
and tell them I'm armed.Okay, come on.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.148
[gunshots continue]

05:26.064 --> 05:29.067
[woman screams]

05:29.111 --> 05:30.634
JESSICA:
Police!

05:30.678 --> 05:31.505
Put down your weapon!

05:38.947 --> 05:40.514
Unis and EMTs

05:40.557 --> 05:42.646
are at the scene, but we can't
get those gunshot victims

05:42.690 --> 05:44.300
out of there
until we clear the shooters.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.562
Couple blocks out.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.824
Any word on the
captain and her niece?

05:46.868 --> 05:48.783
Amy's good. But Cortez
is the only one

05:48.826 --> 05:50.698
in that backyard helping
those injured people.

05:50.741 --> 05:51.742
There could be
more people trapped

05:51.786 --> 05:52.656
inside the house
with the shooters.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.486
What the hell was that, Luca?

05:56.530 --> 05:57.661
I just hit somebody.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.364
You okay?All right, Luca,
you know how this works.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.017
You stay, the truck stays.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.192
Rest of us, let's go.Easy.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.585
Not your fault, man.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.761
Yeah, I know that.You broke my arm.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.154
Deac, I got Chris.
We'll take the two side.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.634
You guys got the one.

06:13.677 --> 06:16.158
I told you this was a bad idea.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.551
Stop talking like that.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.648
Deac, you're in position?

06:27.691 --> 06:29.476
Ready to go.HONDO:
Going in the east side door,

06:29.519 --> 06:31.086
so watch your crossfire.
Wait on my mark.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.479
DEACON:
Roger that.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.798
Metro SWAT!

06:49.496 --> 06:51.149
Drop your weapon!

06:55.284 --> 06:57.895
You got him, Chris?Yep. Down!

06:57.939 --> 07:00.245
Upstairs clear.DEACON:
We're Code 4.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.247
All clear
for paramedics to enter.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.771
I got him, Cap.

07:04.989 --> 07:05.642
Captain, we got him.

07:07.775 --> 07:08.863
We're good.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.609
â™ª

07:49.643 --> 07:52.341
Tiffany was not present
and was not involved.

07:52.384 --> 07:55.518
Right, yes. Uh,
I'll call you back.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.824
How is your daughter?

07:56.867 --> 07:59.087
My niece.
She's really shaken up.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.959
[sighs] Metal detectors
and bag searches from now on.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.308
Drugs and guns
aren't what Tiffany's about.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.397
Where is this Tiffany?
We need to speak to her.

08:05.441 --> 08:08.879
What about? I thought this was
between rival drug dealers.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.533
Well, it looks like it could be,
but this is your sister's house,

08:10.577 --> 08:12.274
and we have to consider
all possibilities.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.015
And I can imagine
she gets her share of threats.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.495
The weirdo files.

08:15.538 --> 08:16.844
We have records on anyone

08:16.887 --> 08:18.498
who's ever posted
a troubling comment

08:18.541 --> 08:20.195
on one of Tiff's vlogs.
We call it the weirdo files.

08:20.238 --> 08:21.892
All right, I need you
to send those over to us,

08:21.936 --> 08:23.633
but I still need to talk
to Tiffany.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.374
She should be landing
at LAX any minute now.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.202
Wait, I thought
she was on the 405

08:27.245 --> 08:29.030
on her way back
from visiting that sick fan?

08:29.073 --> 08:31.598
She was. Two days ago.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.078
And then she went to Vegas,
and then she missed her flight

08:34.122 --> 08:36.124
'cause I wasn't there
to make sure she was on it.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.604
And she was gonna be
three hours late

08:37.647 --> 08:39.867
to an event people stood
in line for all morning.

08:39.910 --> 08:42.043
What happened
to being all about the fans?

08:42.086 --> 08:43.871
Look, I-I know
it's not a good excuse,

08:43.914 --> 08:46.874
but she's
a 21-year-old millionaire.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.659
She can be a bit scattered.

08:49.703 --> 08:50.834
All right,
I want you to hold tight.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.314
I'm gonna have
one of my guys go with you

08:52.357 --> 08:55.665
to pick up Tiffany
at the airport.Yeah.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.624
[sighs]

08:59.582 --> 09:01.584
What's the damage on the kid?

09:01.628 --> 09:03.717
Broken arm, broken collarbone,
possibly some ribs.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.370
They took him to the hospital.Damn, Luca.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.937
I got to write you up a ticket?

09:06.981 --> 09:08.330
Nah, he came out
from behind the bushes.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.723
There's no way
I could've seen him.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.115
I-I mean, I don't know how
he didn't hear us coming.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.769
It's not like Black Betty's
got a stealth mode.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.554
What's his story?

09:14.597 --> 09:16.425
He told the EMTs he was already
in the street running to his car

09:16.468 --> 09:17.818
when we took the
corner too fast.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.733
Yeah. I don't know if he's lying
or got a bad memory,

09:19.776 --> 09:21.822
but that's not how it went down.All right, well,
let the guys in ties

09:21.865 --> 09:23.737
sort it out. Right now we got
a shooter on the loose.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.477
Now, it sounds like it
might be a drug beef,

09:25.521 --> 09:27.001
but we got to cover
all our bases.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.829
I need someone
to go over the files

09:28.872 --> 09:30.787
that Sarah's about to send us
on potential Tiffany stalkers.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.267
Yeah, I'm on it.HONDO:
All right.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.877
See if Wendy's got any insight.

09:33.921 --> 09:34.922
She'll know what to look for
psychologically better than us.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.619
Someone must have gotten

09:36.663 --> 09:39.143
the shooter on camera
with all the phones.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.624
I'll take that, too. I'll see
what I can find on social media.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.452
Save some for the rest
of us, hero.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.846
No, I'll-I'll be stuck at HQ
working with Wendy, anyway.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.021
I might as well do
it while I'm there.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.152
Well, let me know what you find.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.284
Okay.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.809
Hey.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.594
You all right?

09:54.637 --> 09:57.597
My niece could have gotten shot
on my watch.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.816
But she didn't
because you were there.

09:59.860 --> 10:03.080
I'll be all right
when we catch the third shooter.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.261
Self-defense?

10:10.305 --> 10:11.741
Swear to God.DEACON:
You know,

10:11.785 --> 10:13.047
there are only
a couple hundred active

10:13.090 --> 10:14.396
concealed carry permits
in L.A. County.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.050
I seriously doubt

10:16.093 --> 10:18.052
that your name's
on any one of them,

10:18.095 --> 10:19.967
which means you shouldn't have
been packing to begin with.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.056
If we hadn't been, we'd be dead.
Dude came at us.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.361
Rival dealer?

10:23.405 --> 10:25.059
Your friend's bag
had enough Molly

10:25.102 --> 10:27.322
for a party twice that size.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.455
I don't know what Larry did
or didn't have in his bag.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.587
I was there
for the "Tiffany Experience."

10:31.631 --> 10:34.024
Illegal guns a big part of that?

10:34.068 --> 10:35.983
Hey, it's that other dude's
bullets that hit those kids.

10:36.026 --> 10:38.072
You're forgetting about the kid
you hit when you shot at me.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.813
Number one, that was Larry.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.162
And number two, he thought
you were with the other dude.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.729
So, who was this guy?

10:42.772 --> 10:44.861
Why was he shooting at you?I don't know him.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.689
Me and Larry were
in this back hallway

10:46.733 --> 10:48.125
talking to some other
Tiffany fans.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.692
We see someone come out
of Tiffany's bedroom,

10:49.736 --> 10:51.912
which was off-limits,
so we assumed

10:51.955 --> 10:54.218
it must be security
or something, but it's not.

10:54.262 --> 10:57.004
How did you know
it was her bedroom?

10:57.047 --> 10:58.701
Like I told you, I'm a fan.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.355
Anyway, this guy's

11:00.398 --> 11:01.791
got a gun under his jacket,

11:01.835 --> 11:03.837
his hand's on the gun, and he's

11:03.880 --> 11:05.708
coming our way with this
weird-ass look in his eyes.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.928
Assumed he was gonna try
and rip us off.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.625
That's just when

11:09.669 --> 11:11.322
everything just
got out of hand.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.023
I think maybe Kira's right.
I need

11:16.066 --> 11:18.634
to decide if this relationship
is something I want or not.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.418
I can't string them along
forever.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.637
And what's her fiancÃ© like?

11:21.681 --> 11:22.986
Is he a good-looking guy?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.422
Looks aren't everything.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.946
Ah, so I got nothing
to worry about?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.473
Hmm.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.170
He's a little on the dorky side,
don't you think?

11:33.214 --> 11:34.737
CHRIS:
If you mean ruggedly sexy,

11:34.781 --> 11:36.434
then, yeah, sure.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.437
What about there?
Ah.

11:39.481 --> 11:40.787
So far, they all just

11:40.830 --> 11:42.614
cut out
or just start shaking like crazy

11:42.658 --> 11:44.138
as soon as the shooting starts.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.748
You seem to be taking
on a lot lately.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.185
No, I'm good.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.361
Back to your love life.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.408
What's, uh, ruggedly dorky
guy's name again? Chuck?

11:53.451 --> 11:55.236
Ty. I would never date
a guy named Chuck.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.803
LUCA:
Ty, huh?

11:56.846 --> 11:58.543
What happened to
that girl Kira, man?

11:58.587 --> 12:00.197
A few weeks ago, she's
all you could talk about.

12:02.678 --> 12:05.072
Actually, Ty is Kira's fiancÃ©.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.162
They want me to...

12:09.554 --> 12:11.034
...be the third

12:11.078 --> 12:13.558
in a...
polyamorous relationship.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.430
Whoa. Wait, wait.
What?! Like...

12:15.473 --> 12:16.736
Like a sister-wives,

12:16.779 --> 12:18.912
not-allowed-to-cut-your-hair
kind of thing?

12:18.955 --> 12:20.609
No. This isn't a guy
looking for a fantasy.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.393
I would be in a relationship
with the both of 'em...

12:24.091 --> 12:26.310
...equally.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.271
It's complicated.

12:30.314 --> 12:31.751
So, uh, back to our case.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.623
[clears throat]

12:34.666 --> 12:37.147
The, uh, dealer says that
the shooter was snooping

12:37.191 --> 12:39.410
around Tiffany's bedroom,
so it's looking more and more

12:39.454 --> 12:42.283
like he was after
Tiffany and not the drugs.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.111
Just heard back from Tan.
Airport pickup went smoothly.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.808
And, uh,
they're back at the condo now.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.028
Wait. She's got a condo
and a house?

12:48.071 --> 12:51.553
I get shot at once a week,
I'm surfing couch to couch.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.424
Are we ever gonna talk to
Tiffany, see what she knows?

12:53.468 --> 12:56.036
Yeah. That's the plan. Street,
you keep searching these videos.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.689
And Hondo wants everyone else
with him.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.256
You know,
if this is about Tiffany,

12:59.300 --> 13:01.389
a couple of us are gonna
have to stay on her.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.130
Not it.

13:09.745 --> 13:12.530
Luca?Yes, sir?

13:12.574 --> 13:14.184
I need a word.What's up?

13:14.228 --> 13:17.013
That kid you hit in Black
Betty says he's gonna sue.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.015
So? We get sued
all the time.
Well...

13:19.059 --> 13:21.539
It's just another loser trying
to win the LAPD lottery.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.890
Yeah, well, until we settle this
to the chief's satisfaction,

13:23.933 --> 13:25.805
your official driving
privileges are suspended.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.502
Are you kidding me?!I wish I was.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.460
Look, I apologize for the
outburst, sir, but I've never

13:29.504 --> 13:31.854
heard of this happening
short of a DUI.
HONDO:
I think the word

13:31.898 --> 13:33.682
you're looking for,
Luca, is unprecedented.Well, it's not

13:33.725 --> 13:36.032
about the lawsuit.
This kid you hit--

13:36.076 --> 13:37.512
he's apparently dating
the mayor's daughter.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.296
So this is coming
from the mayor's office?

13:39.340 --> 13:41.603
It's coming from the chief.Who's looking to score points

13:41.646 --> 13:43.213
with the mayor,
it sounds like.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.302
Well, look,
I'm sorry, Luca.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.261
With these budget cuts
breathing down my neck,

13:47.304 --> 13:49.306
I can't push back as
hard as I normally would.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.874
But you got my word, I'm gonna
expedite this personally.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.529
It could be weeks, months,
driving shotgun.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.444
It could just be hours, Luca.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.794
Right. We got a job
to do, I know.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.970
All right, Chris,
you got the wheel.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.712
It just sounds wrong.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.019
All right, here.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.195
Haven't been in a
vehicle I wasn't driving

14:08.238 --> 14:10.066
in I can't even
remember how long.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.765
[engine starts]

14:13.809 --> 14:17.204
Yeah. It was the scariest thing
that ever happened to me.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.858
It was scary for me, too.
I wasn't there,

14:18.901 --> 14:22.470
but what if I had been?

14:22.513 --> 14:24.820
But in a weird way, this
brings us closer as sisters.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.431
[door closes]Ugh.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.694
Don't worry. We'll
just edit it out.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.914
We should reshoot it.
Both of you are so low energy.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.743
Well, I've had
a tough morning.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.484
[ringtone playing]

14:36.527 --> 14:39.008
It's Tristan.
He must have heard.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.358
It's been nonstop since
we got her from the airport.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.839
[laughs]
Babe!

14:43.883 --> 14:47.234
Oh, Lord. I just woke up.And I was the first
person you call?

14:47.277 --> 14:49.801
Don't be jealous because
it won't do you any good.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.892
Can she do that later?Probably. Tristan's got
a pretty tight schedule, though.

14:52.935 --> 14:57.244
Tight schedule? Didn't she
just say he's her boyfriend?Oh, they're not actually dating.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.680
It's just for the videos.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.203
They're cross-pollinating
each other's followers.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.944
Isn't Tristan the vlogger
who does the... What is it?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.685
The daily goof.Yeah. He plays these
elaborate pranks

15:03.728 --> 15:05.643
on his friends.[clears throat]

15:08.298 --> 15:10.257
Uh-oh. No-fun Sarah

15:10.300 --> 15:12.041
says I have to wrap it up.
Guess some things never change.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.869
But I promise...

15:13.913 --> 15:15.740
Hey, Tristan,
I hear you like pranks.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.917
[sighs] Yeah?Well, here's one for you.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.701
Excuse me?

15:19.744 --> 15:21.181
Tiffany, my name is
Sergeant Harrelson.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.965
I want to ask you
some questions

15:23.009 --> 15:25.185
about one of the guys who
shot up your place this morning.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.361
I thought it was
for sure about drugs.It might be,

15:27.404 --> 15:29.145
but the shooter who got away
may have been targeting you.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.974
So we might have to put you
in protective custody.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.977
Oh, God. That
sounds restrictive.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.675
So, you're saying
I'm in danger?

15:39.460 --> 15:41.201
Hey. Hey, how about

15:41.244 --> 15:43.203
we turn that thing off?Oh, we're not live-streaming.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.945
We'll edit it into the video
I just did. But don't worry.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.904
We'll make you guys look
so badass. JD's a wizard.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.305
I saw that look
on your face earlier.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.482
About the Ty and Kira thing.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.832
What kind of look?

16:03.875 --> 16:06.182
Let's just say I-I got
a sneak peek at how my aunts

16:06.226 --> 16:07.705
and uncles are gonna react.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.272
[scoffs] Come on,
I'm not that old.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.405
But you disapprove, right?

16:11.448 --> 16:13.276
You think it's...

16:13.320 --> 16:15.148
immoral or something?

16:17.063 --> 16:19.674
It's your business,
it's not mine.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.677
Come on, just
give me a real answer.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.939
You know me.
I can take it.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.683
Probably think
I'm gonna do whatever I want,

16:28.726 --> 16:31.077
and you're right.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.730
That doesn't mean
I don't respect your opinion.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.606
You want to know
if I disapprove?

16:40.086 --> 16:42.044
If your daughter
brought home a couple,

16:42.088 --> 16:44.220
how would you feel about that?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.878
[sighs]
Honestly?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.923
I'd be worried for her.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.839
That couple is
in a relationship

16:54.883 --> 16:56.798
that predates you.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.670
They're getting married,

16:59.714 --> 17:02.021
and you're not part
of that marriage,

17:02.064 --> 17:05.589
no matter how they try
to sell it to you.

17:05.633 --> 17:09.028
I think you're setting yourself
up for heartache.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.214
A hundred feet
to your two o'clock.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.824
Stay casual.
He's watching.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.784
Fits the captain's
description of the shooter.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.484
Hondo, we got a guy
across the street

17:30.527 --> 17:32.312
that looks
like our shooter.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.705
Roger that, Deac.Look, everybody
get on the ground.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.577
Stay away from the window,
all right?What's going on?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.622
What's happening?For God's sake,
Tiff, just get down.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.102
I can go around the building,

17:40.146 --> 17:41.799
make the block
and get behind him.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.714
No. Seeing you leave
might spook him, Chris.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.238
Tan, get unis
to surround the block.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.762
Luca... Hey, I said
turn that thing off!

17:51.505 --> 17:53.159
He's on the move.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.075
He's on the run.
We're in pursuit.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.078
[tires squealing]

17:59.121 --> 18:01.080
I'm with you, Deac!I got the door.

18:12.743 --> 18:13.788
He's got a gun.

18:26.714 --> 18:29.238
[door squeaks open]

18:29.282 --> 18:31.153
LAPD!

18:31.197 --> 18:31.936
Come out of the house.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.986
Did you see a guy with
a gun run through here?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.118
DEACON: All right,
go back inside.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.032
Stay away from the doors
and the windows.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.557
Hondo, check it out.

18:46.212 --> 18:49.519
He must've dropped it
on the way over.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.869
That's a .45, just like
the shooter this morning.

18:51.913 --> 18:55.221
Coming after her twice
in three hours. He's motivated.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.962
More like obsessed. He's not
gonna stop until we stop him.

19:03.229 --> 19:06.580
Guys, if the worst happens--
I don't want to say it even--

19:06.623 --> 19:08.538
but I want you to know
it was worth it for all of you.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.279
Are those your
feet or Luca's?

19:10.323 --> 19:12.412
You kidding? Luca's feet would
take up the whole frame.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.240
[sighs]
I think I just got dumber.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.590
I can't believe this is the
world my kids are growing up in.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.244
I told them
to turn that damn camera off.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.550
Videos like that'll probably
encourage this guy.

19:20.594 --> 19:23.118
All right, so who's babysitting
our little princess?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.815
Not it.Hey, I had her
all morning.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.817
[scoffs]

19:31.474 --> 19:33.389
Hey.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.262
What's up, man?

19:36.305 --> 19:38.481
Want to talk about it?

19:38.525 --> 19:40.396
You're starting
to sound like Dr. Wendy.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.006
[chuckles]
What, are you afraid

19:42.050 --> 19:43.704
they're gonna say that
accident was your fault?

19:43.747 --> 19:46.141
No, it's not that exactly.
It's just...

19:46.185 --> 19:48.883
Look, driving has been
such a big part of my life

19:48.926 --> 19:50.189
since before SWAT, even.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.234
I mean, until today,

19:52.278 --> 19:54.105
I'd never even hit a squirrel.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.672
I had a perfect driving record.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.500
Luca, you can't be perfect
all the time.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.850
Yeah, but we're SWAT. Perfect's
part of our job description.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.678
[laughs]
Come on, man.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.854
That's a part
that none of us live up to.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.248
You know, the best way
to get your mind

20:06.292 --> 20:09.120
off your own problems-- to
listen to someone else's.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.818
You got something going on?

20:10.861 --> 20:13.429
Not me. Street.

20:13.473 --> 20:16.171
He's been doing way
too much lately,

20:16.215 --> 20:17.520
but he ain't gonna want
to hear that from me.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.609
He and Chris are pretty tight.Luca.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.528
We've all seen the shade
you've been throwing his way.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.835
You lived with the
kid for months, man.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.272
And he needs his boy back.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.715
[door closes]

20:38.759 --> 20:41.109
Amy, your mom texted.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.676
They're taking
an early flight back.

20:42.719 --> 20:45.244
Yeah, I know.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.333
This is Dr. Wendy Hughes.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.378
She's a psychologist.Hi, Amy.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.075
After what happened
this morning,

20:51.119 --> 20:52.512
I thought it might be good
for the two of you to talk.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.517
Something wrong
with the sandwich?

20:57.560 --> 20:59.170
I'm not hungry.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.390
You haven't eaten all day.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.739
You think Tiffany will be okay?

21:02.783 --> 21:04.088
I think you...I bet

21:04.132 --> 21:05.960
she's plenty safe
with SWAT protecting her.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.222
They're amazing.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.702
That's right.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.358
She'll be fine.

21:12.401 --> 21:16.187
Just heard back
on the gun the guy dropped.

21:16.231 --> 21:19.190
No usable prints,
serial number filed off.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.020
Any luck on your end?

21:23.064 --> 21:24.326
Uh, not really.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.241
I mean, I hate the Internet now,

21:26.285 --> 21:28.374
so I-I guess
that's progress as a person.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.202
Look, we all notice
how you keep, uh,

21:31.246 --> 21:33.857
volunteering for the crap
assignments, on top of manning

21:33.901 --> 21:35.990
the armory on your off time.Still five more months

21:36.033 --> 21:39.428
of probation.Which means you got
to be on top of your game,

21:39.472 --> 21:41.082
not that you have
to pay some kind of penance.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.649
That's all in the past.

21:42.692 --> 21:45.695
In the past?Yeah, it's water
under the bridge.

21:45.739 --> 21:49.133
So quit burning the candle at
both ends. You look exhausted.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.701
Honestly, it's not
even the workload.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.313
It's just not knowing where
I'm sleeping any given night.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.924
My mom, she's still
at my old place.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.230
And it's just more expensive
than I thought it'd be

21:59.274 --> 22:00.797
getting a second lease.

22:00.841 --> 22:03.365
You're talking to a couch
surfing pro here. I get it.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.542
I stayed, uh, with my
old training officer

22:06.586 --> 22:08.588
for a week,
but his wife

22:08.631 --> 22:10.894
has this dog that hates me
even more than she does.[laughs]

22:10.938 --> 22:14.158
So now I'm sleeping
in my buddy's spare room

22:14.202 --> 22:15.725
in Santa Clarita.
Only last night,

22:15.769 --> 22:18.511
I forgot and drove
back to Long Beach

22:18.554 --> 22:19.816
and I didn't realize
till I was halfway there.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.165
I had no idea.

22:21.209 --> 22:24.255
Anyway, um, I'm
not complaining.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.257
I'm all done with excuses.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.046
Hello.

22:39.053 --> 22:39.967
Captain, what's up?

22:40.010 --> 22:42.143
Just checking in.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.014
SARAH: Two and a half million
views on this morning's video

22:44.058 --> 22:45.929
and over 100,000
new followers.

22:45.973 --> 22:48.889
[chuckles] Someone should try
to kill me every week.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.020
That's bad.

22:50.064 --> 22:51.065
I shouldn't say that, should I?

22:51.108 --> 22:53.023
No, you shouldn't.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.198
[clears throat]

22:54.242 --> 22:55.809
I'm Captain Cortez.

22:55.852 --> 22:58.246
Captain Cortez was at the event
this morning.

22:58.289 --> 22:59.465
She saved our lives.

22:59.508 --> 23:02.206
Oh, cool.
Girl power.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.512
So when can we go

23:03.556 --> 23:05.514
to the hospital to visit
my fans that got shot?

23:05.558 --> 23:08.256
Why? Is that gonna
get you more followers?

23:08.299 --> 23:10.476
There a problem
or something?

23:10.519 --> 23:11.433
Can we talk alone?

23:15.481 --> 23:17.396
[clears throat]

23:18.788 --> 23:21.530
Tiffany, you're a con artist.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.793
You don't really care
about your fans.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.666
[exhales]All they are to you
is views and followers.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.886
Millions of teenagers
look up to you.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.976
My niece could have gotten
killed this morning.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.718
She's traumatized.
And for what?

23:35.762 --> 23:38.939
'Cause she worships a version
of you that doesn't even exist.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.462
Well, you could say the
same thing about an actor

23:40.506 --> 23:43.073
or LeBron James.This is not a movie
or a game.

23:43.117 --> 23:46.425
You're pretending it's
your real life, but it's not.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.122
Even your boyfriend is fake.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.777
Well, my fans get it.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.214
And I bet your niece does, too.

23:53.257 --> 23:56.217
I've been doing this since
I was 15. Did you know that?

23:56.260 --> 24:00.439
I'm not the same person I was
when I was 15, but I have

24:00.482 --> 24:02.528
to act like it, because
that's what the fans want.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.878
That's the Tiffany Experience.

24:04.921 --> 24:06.401
And, by the way,

24:06.445 --> 24:07.968
I get comments all the time

24:08.011 --> 24:10.753
from fans telling me
watching myvideos

24:10.797 --> 24:13.495
keeps them from
slitting their wrists.

24:13.539 --> 24:18.108
So, maybe I'm not a completely
terrible person after all.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.982
You could be so much more.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.595
Captain, we need you.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.123
It's too fuzzy for
facial recognition

24:33.167 --> 24:35.299
but matches the
witness descriptions.

24:35.343 --> 24:37.301
I saw him only from the back,
but the clothes look right.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.173
WENDY:
I zeroed in on eight

24:39.216 --> 24:40.914
of the possible witnesses
based on the weirdo files

24:40.957 --> 24:42.263
that Sarah gave us--

24:42.306 --> 24:44.308
men whose posts
and messages to Tiffany

24:44.352 --> 24:45.527
showed the obsession

24:45.571 --> 24:47.790
and recklessness
that we are looking for.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.749
And we got a match.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.099
Pete Delkis.
Multiple recent addresses all

24:52.142 --> 24:53.927
in the Woodland
Hills-Canoga Park area,

24:53.970 --> 24:56.016
including his
parents' house.Nice job.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.104
It looks like he has priors.Criminal stalking

24:57.147 --> 24:59.367
and unlawful discharge
of a weapon.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.456
Wasn't hard for me
to single him out.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.545
Those are felonies. He shouldn't
have access to a gun.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.939
Well, if we're lucky,
it's the only one he had.
But I'm not counting on it.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.810
All right, let's tac up. With
this many addresses, we can't do

25:07.854 --> 25:09.420
no-knock entries.

25:09.464 --> 25:12.380
Luca.Yes, sir.

25:12.423 --> 25:13.555
Your driving privileges
have been reinstated.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.165
What?Street found a video

25:15.209 --> 25:17.646
of the accident. It confirms
your version of events.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.561
I had to run it up
the chain, but...

25:19.605 --> 25:21.128
you're good to go, pal.
Congratulations.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.958
Bury the lede, dude.Glad I could help, man.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.569
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chris.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.136
Hand 'em over.What?

25:29.179 --> 25:30.529
Keys.
[chuckles]

25:43.019 --> 25:46.153
It's LAPD!

25:46.196 --> 25:48.677
Open the door!

25:53.073 --> 25:56.555
MIKE: Hold your badge up
to the peephole, please.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.430
[camera clicks]

26:04.998 --> 26:06.347
Mike Delkis?

26:06.390 --> 26:07.566
Yes.

26:07.609 --> 26:08.741
May we come in?

26:15.922 --> 26:17.967
A photo
of your badge

26:18.011 --> 26:20.927
has been uploaded
to my cloud storage, Officer.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.842
We're looking for your
son, Pete. Is he here?

26:22.885 --> 26:24.104
No idea, Officer.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.759
I don't need
to cooperate with you.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.022
Do you have guns
in the house?I do.

26:29.065 --> 26:32.112
It's America still,
isn't it?Are they in a safe?

26:32.155 --> 26:34.984
Pete's got priors.
He's not supposed to have
access to any firearms.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.725
You trying to use
my son's arrests as an excuse

26:36.769 --> 26:39.598
to confiscate
my legally purchased guns?

26:39.641 --> 26:41.600
Pete shot a person
this morning, Mike.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.166
And it was likely
one of your guns.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.560
That's impossible.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.649
You own a .45?Desk drawer.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.051
HONDO:
Don't worry.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.487
He lost it hopping a fence.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.749
You got any more in the house?

27:00.793 --> 27:02.621
Yeah, 9-mil.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.448
Nightstand by my bed.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.886
What good do they do me
in a safe?

27:06.929 --> 27:08.452
Somebody breaks in,
am I supposed to run

27:08.496 --> 27:11.107
to my closet, turn the dial back
and forth while he kills me?

27:13.457 --> 27:14.850
Strike two.

27:18.593 --> 27:21.074
Copy that. He's still on
the loose, and he's still armed.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.119
Well, that's comforting.
At least Tiffany's safe here.

27:23.163 --> 27:25.556
But as long as Pete is free,
he's a danger.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.036
We just don't know
to who else.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.038
All of his posts
on Tiffany's vlogs

27:29.082 --> 27:30.561
are all about Tiffany herself.

27:30.605 --> 27:31.824
He thinks that they're
meant to be together,

27:31.867 --> 27:34.087
that only he's
good enough for her.

27:34.130 --> 27:37.090
He calls everyone on her videos
sponges, imbeciles,

27:37.133 --> 27:38.526
a lot worse.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.049
Everyone in her videos?

27:40.093 --> 27:42.051
Like her sister, Sarah?

27:42.095 --> 27:45.272
She was at the event
Pete shot up this morning.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.709
And she was at the condo
where Pete showed up there.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.059
Maybe Pete's
not after Tiffany.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.453
He could be after the people he
thinks are keeping him from her.

27:52.496 --> 27:55.369
Sarah, JD, the fake boyfriend.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.591
[quietly]:
Check it out, bro.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.289
[enthusiastically]:
Check it out, bro.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.478
[laughs]

28:17.521 --> 28:20.611
My bad, bro. Should've warned
you not to stand there!

28:20.655 --> 28:21.830
[garage door opening]

28:21.874 --> 28:23.832
Dahlia?

28:25.573 --> 28:27.401
Who's Dahlia?

28:27.444 --> 28:29.403
Who are you?

28:29.446 --> 28:31.361
How'd you get in here?

28:31.405 --> 28:33.668
When you vlog outside,
sometimes you use

28:33.712 --> 28:36.715
the keypad to
close the garage.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.542
I had to watch about a
hundred of them to piece
the code together.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.588
Y-You what?

28:41.720 --> 28:44.374
Wait, did Marty send you?

28:44.418 --> 28:46.028
[clicks tongue]
Prank war is over, Marty!

28:46.072 --> 28:47.073
Who's Dahlia?

28:49.075 --> 28:51.164
Are you cheating on Tiffany?

28:53.644 --> 28:55.472
[chuckles] You must have
the IQ of a six-year-old

28:55.516 --> 28:56.865
and you're cheating on her?

28:56.909 --> 29:00.303
Uh, hey, look,
I-I love my fans, bro,

29:00.347 --> 29:02.915
but, uh, this is trespassing,
all right?

29:02.958 --> 29:04.873
Uh...

29:04.917 --> 29:05.744
You're the guy
from this morning.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.615
Look, Tiff's not here, man!

29:07.658 --> 29:09.617
Well, that's too bad.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.750
I wish she could see
the way you're cowering,

29:11.793 --> 29:13.186
betraying your beta male traits.

29:13.229 --> 29:15.449
We're not even really dating
in real life.

29:15.492 --> 29:18.321
[phone chiming]Okay, that's just
for the followers, I swear!

29:20.584 --> 29:22.064
Police are at my house.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.110
Uh, um, maybe
I can help you out.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.676
I don't really carry cash
on me or anything.

29:31.334 --> 29:31.987
[exhales]

29:58.274 --> 30:00.059
He's dead.Left side clear.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.234
Right side clear.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.844
May not mean anything,

30:02.888 --> 30:04.237
but doesn't look
like his phone is on him.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.847
I'm guessing that's not
something you usually say

30:05.891 --> 30:07.153
about this guy.Captain,

30:07.196 --> 30:08.067
we've got a problem.

30:11.026 --> 30:13.246
Here to yell at me again?

30:13.289 --> 30:14.247
Where are Sarah and JD?

30:14.290 --> 30:16.031
Why?

30:16.075 --> 30:17.946
Because we think the
shooter is targeting them.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.513
[chuckles]:
For what reason?

30:19.556 --> 30:20.470
Tiffany, where are they?

30:20.514 --> 30:22.516
The shuttle.

30:22.559 --> 30:25.040
The Tiffany Experience
party shuttle.

30:25.084 --> 30:29.088
You said you'd shut down your
events until we found this guy.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.655
Yeah, but...

30:31.699 --> 30:34.310
he's after me, and I'm right
here, where you told me to be.

30:34.354 --> 30:37.313
Plus, I'm trending
like crazy right now,

30:37.357 --> 30:40.055
and Tristan texted
Sarah with this hot idea

30:40.099 --> 30:42.492
for me to throw a pop-up
shuttle in my honor.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.755
And he's gonna make
a surprise appearance.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.715
Tiffany,
Tristan didn't send that text.

30:49.630 --> 30:50.979
He's dead.

30:54.113 --> 30:57.029
[helicopter whirring]

31:00.989 --> 31:02.295
Hello, Tiffany fans.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.992
Uh, Tiffany's not
here right now.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.994
I'm Pete. JD's here, too.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.562
JD?

31:08.605 --> 31:10.520
[exhales]

31:10.564 --> 31:13.132
I wasn't planning on things
turning out this way,

31:13.175 --> 31:14.960
but I know some of you
will understand.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.179
I know you understand, Tiffany,
why I had to kill Tristan.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.789
It's too late for me,

31:18.833 --> 31:20.617
but I'm gonna make sure

31:20.661 --> 31:21.967
that the next real man
who truly deserves you

31:22.010 --> 31:22.968
won't be taken away from you

31:23.011 --> 31:24.578
by beta-male sponges

31:24.621 --> 31:26.014
and bitch gatekeepers.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.364
[sirens wailing]

31:33.630 --> 31:35.284
Where's CHP
with that spike strip?

31:35.328 --> 31:37.330
Best they can promise
is the Roscoe intersection.

31:37.373 --> 31:38.809
That's four miles out.

31:38.853 --> 31:40.246
Captain, this guy's hot.
Is there any way

31:40.289 --> 31:41.334
they can move it up
a few streets?

31:41.377 --> 31:42.204
Working on it.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.948
CHRIS:
Even if we get it stopped,

31:46.992 --> 31:48.123
the tint on that thing
is too dark

31:48.167 --> 31:49.951
to get a clean shot.We might be able

31:49.995 --> 31:52.171
to sneak someone in through
the rear luggage compartment.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.172
Whatever our entry point is,
as long as he's live-streaming,

31:53.215 --> 31:54.695
we'll know
exactly where he is

31:54.738 --> 31:56.523
on the shuttle.And which way he's looking.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.829
With enough time,
we can get someone in there
while he's distracted.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.092
All right, I like it, but if
we don't stop this thing soon,

32:00.135 --> 32:01.049
it's not gonna matter.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.752
I see some of you

32:08.796 --> 32:11.973
are asking me why I'm
live-streaming this right now.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.106
Why not just kill these two
like I did Tristan? Okay.

32:16.195 --> 32:18.588
Over 200,000 viewers

32:18.632 --> 32:21.287
and climbing. Over 200,000
of you get to hear directly

32:21.330 --> 32:22.984
from me why I have to do this.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.682
And then when I get
to a million...

32:25.726 --> 32:28.990
What is it that-that
Tiffany always says?

32:29.034 --> 32:31.688
She says,
"You know you've made it

32:31.732 --> 32:34.735
when you get a million views."

32:34.778 --> 32:35.910
Please, is there anything...

32:35.954 --> 32:38.434
Just stay out of the way.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.871
I wanted to get
those million with you, Tiff.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.700
I did.

32:43.744 --> 32:48.314
But at least I'm going
to make it. Right?

32:48.357 --> 32:50.969
So come on, Tiffany fans,
let's rally, let's do this.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.188
As soon as we get to a million,

32:53.232 --> 32:54.755
you're gonna see these leeches
get what they deserve.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.626
He's waiting for a million
viewers before he shoots them.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.849
HONDO: Captain, if we shut down
his live stream,

33:01.892 --> 33:04.025
he might start killing them
right then and there.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.419
A million viewers. That-that
should give us enough time.

33:06.462 --> 33:07.855
No one with a conscience
is gonna tune in now.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.291
Hondo.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.033
It's climbing faster.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.035
No.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.297
A lot faster.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.473
We're not gonna make it
to that spike strip

33:17.517 --> 33:18.997
before he pulls the trigger.

33:25.090 --> 33:29.224
[sirens wailing]

33:29.268 --> 33:31.574
Over 700,000 viewers
on Pete's live stream now.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.054
If we don't get to that
shuttle before he hits

33:33.098 --> 33:34.534
a million, those
hostages are dead.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.058
Does CHP have any cars in
the area with a mobile spike?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.538
On its way
but it's ten minutes out.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.366
He's gonna hit a million
way before that.

33:40.409 --> 33:41.976
Can they PIT maneuver
something that big?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.717
No way, not with a cruiser.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.762
Black Betty could.

33:45.806 --> 33:48.026
Hey, Luca.You read my mind.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.897
You sure this thing's
nimble enough?I'm gonna make it nimble enough.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.030
It's dangerous.You see any other options?

33:52.073 --> 33:54.380
All right, Tan.
We got to time this

33:54.423 --> 33:56.382
to when Pete's gun
is turned away from Sarah.

33:56.425 --> 33:57.992
Captain, tell CHP
to make room for us

33:58.036 --> 33:59.689
at the front of that convoy.

33:59.733 --> 34:00.734
Good to have you back
in that hot seat, Luca.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.268
You know, I personally
handed you my audition packet

34:13.312 --> 34:15.444
three months ago.SARAH: Sor-- I'm sorry.

34:15.488 --> 34:19.535
We-we get so many. It probably
just got lost, that's all.

34:23.235 --> 34:26.281
You can't trick me,
Sarah. Okay?

34:26.325 --> 34:28.457
Maybe you can fool soy-faced

34:28.501 --> 34:29.937
cucks like JD here,
but not me, all right?

34:34.289 --> 34:37.118
I tried to give the packet
to you, Tiff,

34:37.162 --> 34:39.120
but, well, Sarah said
I had to wait

34:39.164 --> 34:40.295
in the back of the line all day,

34:40.339 --> 34:41.557
and then when
I finally got there,

34:41.601 --> 34:42.993
she ended the meet and greet

34:43.037 --> 34:44.082
before I could see you.
How convenient.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.268
Wait.

34:57.617 --> 34:58.313
PETE:
Almost there.

35:04.058 --> 35:05.407
Go, Luca![tires screeching]

35:12.545 --> 35:14.590
Get in the back.
Get in the back.

35:14.634 --> 35:17.027
Chris, you're with me.

35:17.071 --> 35:18.507
Tan, we need a window.
Let us know which one.

35:18.551 --> 35:22.337
Keep videoing. If the police
try to come in here,

35:22.381 --> 35:24.426
I'm gonna kill these two
right away.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.427
Deac, be ready to port
the window.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.124
Wait for my enter command.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.045
Where they at, Tan?Side window.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.090
Hostages in the rear.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.439
Chris, move. Street, move.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.140
5,000 viewers away.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.099
Chris, you good?I'm good.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.231
[grunts]

35:48.537 --> 35:51.149
All right, here we go.

35:51.192 --> 35:54.021
Three. Two. Now.

35:57.546 --> 35:58.460
Go! Go!

36:02.247 --> 36:03.509
STREET:
Clear right!

36:03.552 --> 36:06.251
[crying]

36:06.294 --> 36:08.557
Suspect's down.
Both hostages safe.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.178
[sighs]

36:22.354 --> 36:23.485
Did you get the guy?

36:23.529 --> 36:25.183
We got him.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.706
And it looks like you got
your appetite back.

36:26.749 --> 36:27.750
WENDY:
We ordered pizza.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.099
Hope you don't mind.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.145
Thank you for staying with her.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.755
No, thank you.
It was my pleasure.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.540
I've been dealing with
an empty nest lately

36:34.583 --> 36:36.890
since my twin girls went off
to college.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.196
Where did they end up going?

36:38.239 --> 36:40.198
Middlebury and Colgate.

36:40.241 --> 36:43.549
So far away.
I really miss them, so...

36:43.592 --> 36:45.768
Thank you for making
my day, Amy.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.988
Thanks.You're welcome.

36:48.031 --> 36:51.209
Tiffany's still here, you know.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.907
Maybe she'll do
a video with you.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.779
I bet you'd get more viewers
than that girl at your school.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.260
I don't know.

36:59.304 --> 37:02.045
Reconsidering
the vlogging career?

37:02.089 --> 37:03.786
I just think
I might want to talk

37:03.830 --> 37:07.007
about more important stuff...
after today, you know.

37:07.050 --> 37:10.140
I was thinking maybe I could do
one with you, actually.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.057
If you're okay with that.

37:16.451 --> 37:19.280
Hey, Street.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.977
Hey, yo, some fancy
driving today.
Wait up.

37:21.021 --> 37:23.719
Yeah, thanks to you.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.418
Hey, so, you know, what we
were talking about earlier--

37:26.461 --> 37:28.071
water under the
bridge and all that.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.639
Look, everyone
was pissed at me.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.032
For good reason.

37:32.075 --> 37:33.294
I get it.No, I wasn't pissed.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.992
Look, okay, yeah,
I was pissed.

37:36.036 --> 37:38.386
But that's not why I was
so hard on you in the academy.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.997
Okay, you might
think because of

37:41.041 --> 37:42.825
who my dad and my granddad were,
that they were in SWAT,

37:42.869 --> 37:44.349
that I was a shoo-in.

37:44.392 --> 37:45.828
But the truth is
that the instructors

37:45.872 --> 37:48.570
were harder on me
than anyone else.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.355
Okay, they didn't
want anybody in SWAT

37:50.398 --> 37:52.313
because of who their dad was.

37:52.357 --> 37:56.709
So they needed to see that I
wanted it more than anyone else.

37:58.885 --> 38:02.105
That's what I needed
to see from you.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.545
I appreciate
the second chance, man.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.768
So we gonna bunk together
again or what, man?

38:12.812 --> 38:15.771
I mean, look, I got this new
house in East Hollywood, right.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.599
I'm still fixing it up.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.253
It's a two bedroom;
I'm only using one.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.515
You helped me out
when I needed a place,

38:20.559 --> 38:21.777
so just don't say no, man.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.431
Come on, just...Stop. Stop.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.262
You had me at...

38:28.306 --> 38:30.612
whatever the first word
in that sentence was.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.092
[both laugh]

38:35.356 --> 38:38.707
About our conversation
last night...

38:38.751 --> 38:40.361
For something you don't
want to think about,

38:40.405 --> 38:42.363
you sure keep
bringing it up.

38:42.407 --> 38:45.410
I just want you to know
I'm grateful.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.934
And I don't mean
paying for that lamp.

38:47.977 --> 38:50.458
I mean for the way
you handled it when it happened.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.330
The fact that you don't look
at me any different after that.

38:52.373 --> 38:55.898
Hondo, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

38:55.942 --> 39:00.338
Listen, my ex-husband
has a lot of issues.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.775
Hmm. Oh, I noticed.
[chuckles]

39:02.818 --> 39:05.212
But issues only
become problems

39:05.255 --> 39:08.389
when you refuse to accept
you have them, like he does.

39:08.433 --> 39:11.653
Or when you refuse
to acknowledge

39:11.697 --> 39:13.438
the fact that
you're not perfect.

39:13.481 --> 39:18.051
You've got weaknesses
like everybody else.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.404
You know,
there's a guy on my team

39:23.448 --> 39:26.102
who was letting old business
screw up a friendship,

39:26.146 --> 39:28.322
and I said something similar
to him.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.890
Sounds like you just need to
take your own advice, then.

39:30.933 --> 39:34.023
Hmm.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.285
Acknowledge the issue.

39:35.329 --> 39:37.113
Accept the issue.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.551
Is there another "A"
you want to throw in there?

39:39.594 --> 39:41.335
[both laugh]

39:41.379 --> 39:44.425
How about "address"
the issue?

39:44.469 --> 39:46.645
That anger I saw in Tucson

39:46.688 --> 39:49.343
was not just about that
ass of a traffic cop.

39:49.387 --> 39:53.826
There's no way that one guy
got you wound up like that.

39:53.869 --> 39:58.439
There has to be more...
that's been built up.

40:00.746 --> 40:03.444
But you got it out of
your system for now.

40:03.488 --> 40:07.492
So now it's just about keeping
it out of your system.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.366
Yeah.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.069
I hope you're right.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.420
Of course I am.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.609
That was all over my
feed today. That was you?

40:37.652 --> 40:39.480
And the rest
of my team, yeah.

40:39.524 --> 40:40.699
Just a day in
the life, huh?

40:40.742 --> 40:42.091
It was crazy.
It can be.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.484
Or it can be just sitting around
all day

40:43.528 --> 40:45.094
waiting in HQ for a call.

40:45.138 --> 40:47.140
Yeah, a lot like my job.

40:47.183 --> 40:49.751
Yeah, I hear painting's
dangerous work.

40:49.795 --> 40:52.450
I mean, those fumes can
be so toxic, you know.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.451
Oh, my God.

40:53.494 --> 40:56.497
[laughs] Uh, all right.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.934
So, you obviously didn't come
here for my amazing jokes.

40:58.978 --> 41:01.937
Mm-mm.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.070
I, um...

41:04.113 --> 41:09.162
I've been thinking
a lot about this today,

41:09.205 --> 41:11.512
and-and the truth is,

41:11.556 --> 41:15.385
I-I already knew
I wanted to do this,

41:15.429 --> 41:17.649
but I was worried about

41:17.692 --> 41:19.564
what people would think.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.522
Actually, I had to deal
with that today

41:21.566 --> 41:23.089
with a member of my team.

41:23.132 --> 41:24.699
And how'd it go?

41:24.743 --> 41:27.963
Actually, it was... it was fine.

41:28.007 --> 41:31.227
People are surprisingly tolerant
when you give them a chance.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.316
He did make
one good point though.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.058
The two of you,

41:36.102 --> 41:38.017
you guys are getting married.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.324
You both are entering a lifelong
commitment with each other.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.546
It makes it really hard

41:45.590 --> 41:49.376
not to think of my position
as just temporary.

41:49.419 --> 41:50.986
Yes, we are
getting married.

41:51.030 --> 41:54.512
But if we start
a relationship with you,

41:54.555 --> 41:57.079
you will be an equal part
in that new relationship.

41:57.123 --> 41:59.081
TY:
And it's better this way,
don't you think?

41:59.125 --> 42:01.519
I mean, this way
you don't have to worry

42:01.562 --> 42:03.869
about your relationship
with each of us separately.

42:03.912 --> 42:07.046
There's just one question:

42:07.089 --> 42:10.571
how do you mesh with the two
of us as a unit?

42:10.615 --> 42:12.486
â™ª There are things

42:12.530 --> 42:16.229
â™ª That I would never say or do

42:16.272 --> 42:17.578
â™ª There are things...

42:17.622 --> 42:18.710
I think... [laughs]

42:18.753 --> 42:21.277
I think I'm ready to mesh.

42:21.321 --> 42:25.543
â™ª There are things that I would
never say or do â™ª

42:25.586 --> 42:28.284
â™ª There are things
that make me â™ª

42:28.328 --> 42:29.982
â™ª Want to stick
to you like glue. â™ª
