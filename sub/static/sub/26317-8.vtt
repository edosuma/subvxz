Previously onSWAT...Made an aggressive lane change

00:03.829 --> 00:05.396
back there.
Pop the trunk.

00:05.440 --> 00:08.486
Officer, you can't check my car
without probable cause.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.618
Just pop your trunk.

00:09.661 --> 00:10.923
That fool had the nerve to act

00:10.967 --> 00:12.186
like I was the one making it
about race.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.623
And?And...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.715
Didn't you learn anything
while you were on the team?

00:19.758 --> 00:21.325
If it were up to me,
you would not be in the academy.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.414
You had your spot,
and you threw it away.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.981
We both agree
we want you back

00:25.025 --> 00:26.026
on SWAT on a probationary basis.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.376
[laughs] Really?Yes.

00:28.419 --> 00:29.725
KIRA: There's something
that I need to be honest

00:29.768 --> 00:30.987
with you about.
I do have a fiancé,

00:31.031 --> 00:33.163
and we've been looking

00:33.207 --> 00:34.947
for a new third to complete us.

00:34.991 --> 00:38.386
I'm not into being a prop
for other people's fantasies.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.388
It's about so much more
than sex for us.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.346
We're interested
in a real partner.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.616
Nia, listen, uh...

00:51.660 --> 00:56.404
I called the hotel in Tucson to
take care of those damages,

00:56.447 --> 00:58.449
but they told me you
had already covered it.

00:58.493 --> 01:01.844
Look, I'm the one who put
that lamp in the wall,

01:01.887 --> 01:04.586
so there's no way I'm gonna
let you pay for my behavior.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.067
Angry as you were, it could've
been more than just a lamp.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.852
Yeah, I guess, but...

01:09.895 --> 01:11.854
that's not who I am, Nia.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.160
That's not the way
my mama raised me.

01:15.292 --> 01:18.295
I just wanted to let you know
that I took care of it, so...

01:18.339 --> 01:20.558
we can stop talking about it.

01:20.602 --> 01:23.213
I'm not the one who started
this conversation.

01:24.954 --> 01:28.523
But if you ask me...

01:28.566 --> 01:30.525
you needed it.

01:30.568 --> 01:33.223
And you can stop thinking
about it all you want.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.007
Doesn't make it go away.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.401
I'll keep that in mind.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.975
Hey, you.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.411
Hey.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.022
I thought I was early.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.764
I was in a hurry to see you.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.811
We saw each other
just last night.I know.

01:55.854 --> 01:59.075
I think I remember
how you like it. The coffee.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.427
Perfect.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.864
[chuckles softly]

02:05.908 --> 02:08.476
So, where's Ty?

02:08.519 --> 02:09.999
It's been a couple
weeks since it's been

02:10.042 --> 02:11.566
just the two of us.

02:11.609 --> 02:14.177
That's on purpose, actually.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.874
I thought

02:15.918 --> 02:19.530
you'd know enough
about Ty and us by now

02:19.574 --> 02:22.185
to know if you wanted
to date us for real.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.056
If Ty's the issue,

02:24.100 --> 02:25.928
I want you to feel
comfortable saying that.No.

02:25.971 --> 02:29.453
Ty's great, and I totally get
why you're marrying him.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.631
I understand the...

02:33.675 --> 02:35.633
polyamorous thing
a lot better now.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.291
I'm open to the idea.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.816
But...?

02:44.860 --> 02:47.950
I can't believe I'm saying this,

02:47.993 --> 02:50.779
but I'm actually worried
about what people will think.

02:50.822 --> 02:54.739
They'll think you refuse
to let societal norms keep you

02:54.783 --> 02:57.307
from a fulfilling relationship.They'll definitely
not be thinking that.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.657
Look, Chris,
you're the only one

02:59.701 --> 03:01.572
I can see us being with.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.618
But if you're not comfortable
with it now,

03:03.661 --> 03:05.663
do you think you ever will be?

03:08.971 --> 03:10.625
[indistinct chatter]

03:16.413 --> 03:19.068

a million dollars last year?

03:19.111 --> 03:22.332
$1.3 million.Just talking about
herself online?

03:22.376 --> 03:25.814
Without any kind of real talent?

03:25.857 --> 03:28.077
Well, when you say it like that,
it makes it sound silly.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.775
It sounds silly no
matter how you say it.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.778
So, this girl...

03:33.822 --> 03:36.390
Tiffany. She's the most
inspiring lifestyle vlogger

03:36.433 --> 03:38.827
on the Internet.Inspiring?

03:38.870 --> 03:41.960
She videos herself
trying on new outfits.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.224
And now she's famous,
and everyone loves her.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.617
There's worse ways
of making a living.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.445
Please tell me
you're gonna go to college.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.273
I think I'd be good at it.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.754
There's a girl that has
20,000 followers at my school,

03:52.797 --> 03:54.582
and I'm better than her.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.888
Does my sister know
about this plan of yours?

03:56.932 --> 03:59.108
Thanks for getting up
at 4:00 a.m. for this.

04:11.642 --> 04:14.210

04:14.254 --> 04:16.734
But how would you like
to video chat

04:16.778 --> 04:19.781
with my favorite little sister
right now?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.922
Someone needs to
teach her Spanish.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.141
Oh, and JD's here, too.

I'm so sorry I'm late.

04:37.581 --> 04:40.410
I'm sure Sarah told you
that I was in San Diego

04:40.454 --> 04:42.020
visiting a fan,
just like you guys.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.761
Love you guys!

and she's in the hospital.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.939
She's real sick.

04:47.983 --> 04:50.028
We went down there and filmed
a video with Kourtney,

04:50.072 --> 04:52.422
and you'll never believe where
I got this hat I'm wearing.

04:52.466 --> 04:53.771
That's in the video, too,

04:53.815 --> 04:55.991
and we'll post that tomorrow,
so look for it.

04:56.034 --> 04:59.081
One day I'm gonna be riding
back and forth in a helicopter,

04:59.124 --> 05:01.562

on the 405 like everybody else.

is the only one

in that backyard helping
those injured people.

between rival drug dealers.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.533
Well, it looks like it could be,
but this is your sister's house,

08:10.577 --> 08:12.274
and we have to consider
all possibilities.

she gets her share of threats.

to send those over to us,

to Tiffany.

She should be landing
at LAX any minute now.

she was on the 405

08:27.245 --> 08:29.030
on her way back
from visiting that sick fan?

08:29.073 --> 08:31.598
She was. Two days ago.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.078
And then she went to Vegas,
and then she missed her flight

'cause I wasn't there
to make sure she was on it.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.604

three hours late

in line for all morning.

to being all about the fans?

it's not a good excuse,

08:43.914 --> 08:46.874
but she's
a 21-year-old millionaire.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.659
She can be a bit scattered.

08:49.703 --> 08:50.834
All right,
I want you to hold tight.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.314

at the airport.Yeah.

from behind the bushes.

I could've seen him.

he didn't hear us coming.

It's not like Black Betty's
got a stealth mode.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.554
What's his story?

09:14.597 --> 09:16.425
He told the EMTs he was already
in the street running to his car

09:16.468 --> 09:17.818
when we took the
corner too fast.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.733
Yeah. I don't know if he's lying
or got a bad memory,

09:19.776 --> 09:21.822
but that's not how it went down.All right, well,
let the guys in ties

09:21.865 --> 09:23.737
sort it out. Right now we got
a shooter on the loose.

might be a drug beef,

all our bases.

psychologically better than us.

the shooter on camera
with all the phones.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.624
I'll take that, too. I'll see
what I can find on social media.

of us, hero.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.846
No, I'll-I'll be stuck at HQ
working with Wendy, anyway.

I might as well do
it while I'm there.

on my watch.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.816

because you were there.

there are only
a couple hundred active

10:13.090 --> 10:14.396
concealed carry permits
in L.A. County.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.050
I seriously doubt

10:16.093 --> 10:18.052
that your name's
on any one of them,

10:18.095 --> 10:19.967
which means you shouldn't have
been packing to begin with.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.056
If we hadn't been, we'd be dead.
Dude came at us.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.361
Rival dealer?

10:23.405 --> 10:25.059
Your friend's bag
had enough Molly

10:25.102 --> 10:27.322
for a party twice that size.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.455
I don't know what Larry did
or didn't have in his bag.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.587
I was there
for the "Tiffany Experience."

10:31.631 --> 10:34.024
Illegal guns a big part of that?

10:34.068 --> 10:35.983
Hey, it's that other dude's
bullets that hit those kids.

10:36.026 --> 10:38.072
You're forgetting about the kid
you hit when you shot at me.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.813
Number one, that was Larry.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.162
And number two, he thought
you were with the other dude.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.729
So, who was this guy?

10:42.772 --> 10:44.861
Why was he shooting at you?I don't know him.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.689
Me and Larry were
in this back hallway

10:46.733 --> 10:48.125
talking to some other
Tiffany fans.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.692
We see someone come out
of Tiffany's bedroom,

10:49.736 --> 10:51.912
which was off-limits,
so we assumed

10:51.955 --> 10:54.218
it must be security
or something, but it's not.

10:54.262 --> 10:57.004
How did you know
it was her bedroom?

10:57.047 --> 10:58.701
Like I told you, I'm a fan.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.355
Anyway, this guy's

11:00.398 --> 11:01.791
got a gun under his jacket,

11:01.835 --> 11:03.837
his hand's on the gun, and he's

11:03.880 --> 11:05.708
coming our way with this
weird-ass look in his eyes.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.928
Assumed he was gonna try
and rip us off.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.625
That's just when

11:09.669 --> 11:11.322
everything just
got out of hand.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.023
I think maybe Kira's right.
I need

11:16.066 --> 11:18.634
to decide if this relationship
is something I want or not.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.418
I can't string them along
forever.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.637
And what's her fiancé like?

11:21.681 --> 11:22.986
Is he a good-looking guy?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.422
Looks aren't everything.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.946
Ah, so I got nothing
to worry about?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.473
Hmm.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.170
He's a little on the dorky side,
don't you think?

11:33.214 --> 11:34.737
CHRIS:
If you mean ruggedly sexy,

11:34.781 --> 11:36.434
then, yeah, sure.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.437
What about there?
Ah.

11:39.481 --> 11:40.787
So far, they all just

11:40.830 --> 11:42.614
cut out
or just start shaking like crazy

11:42.658 --> 11:44.138
as soon as the shooting starts.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.748
You seem to be taking
on a lot lately.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.185
No, I'm good.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.361
Back to your love life.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.408
What's, uh, ruggedly dorky
guy's name again? Chuck?

11:53.451 --> 11:55.236
Ty. I would never date
a guy named Chuck.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.803
LUCA:
Ty, huh?

11:56.846 --> 11:58.543
What happened to
that girl Kira, man?

11:58.587 --> 12:00.197
A few weeks ago, she's
all you could talk about.

12:02.678 --> 12:05.072
Actually, Ty is Kira's fiancé.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.162
They want me to...

12:09.554 --> 12:11.034
...be the third

12:11.078 --> 12:13.558
in a...
polyamorous relationship.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.430
Whoa. Wait, wait.
What?! Like...

12:15.473 --> 12:16.736
Like a sister-wives,

12:16.779 --> 12:18.912
not-allowed-to-cut-your-hair
kind of thing?

12:18.955 --> 12:20.609
No. This isn't a guy
looking for a fantasy.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.393
I would be in a relationship
with the both of 'em...

12:24.091 --> 12:26.310
...equally.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.271
It's complicated.

12:30.314 --> 12:31.751
So, uh, back to our case.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.623
[clears throat]

12:34.666 --> 12:37.147
The, uh, dealer says that
the shooter was snooping

12:37.191 --> 12:39.410
around Tiffany's bedroom,
so it's looking more and more

12:39.454 --> 12:42.283
like he was after
Tiffany and not the drugs.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.111
Just heard back from Tan.
Airport pickup went smoothly.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.808
And, uh,
they're back at the condo now.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.028
Wait. She's got a condo
and a house?

12:48.071 --> 12:51.553
I get shot at once a week,
I'm surfing couch to couch.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.424
Are we ever gonna talk to
Tiffany, see what she knows?

12:53.468 --> 12:56.036
Yeah. That's the plan. Street,
you keep searching these videos.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.689
And Hondo wants everyone else
with him.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.256
You know,
if this is about Tiffany,

12:59.300 --> 13:01.389
a couple of us are gonna
have to stay on her.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.130
Not it.

13:09.745 --> 13:12.530
Luca?Yes, sir?

13:12.574 --> 13:14.184
I need a word.What's up?

13:14.228 --> 13:17.013
That kid you hit in Black
Betty says he's gonna sue.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.015
So? We get sued
all the time.
Well...

13:19.059 --> 13:21.539
It's just another loser trying
to win the LAPD lottery.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.890
Yeah, well, until we settle this
to the chief's satisfaction,

13:23.933 --> 13:25.805
your official driving
privileges are suspended.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.502
Are you kidding me?!I wish I was.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.460
Look, I apologize for the
outburst, sir, but I've never

13:29.504 --> 13:31.854
heard of this happening
short of a DUI.
HONDO:
I think the word

13:31.898 --> 13:33.682
you're looking for,
Luca, is unprecedented.Well, it's not

13:33.725 --> 13:36.032
about the lawsuit.
This kid you hit--

13:36.076 --> 13:37.512
he's apparently dating
the mayor's daughter.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.296
So this is coming
from the mayor's office?

13:39.340 --> 13:41.603
It's coming from the chief.Who's looking to score points

13:41.646 --> 13:43.213
with the mayor,
it sounds like.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.302
Well, look,
I'm sorry, Luca.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.261
With these budget cuts
breathing down my neck,

13:47.304 --> 13:49.306
I can't push back as
hard as I normally would.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.874
But you got my word, I'm gonna
expedite this personally.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.529
It could be weeks, months,
driving shotgun.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.444
It could just be hours, Luca.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.794
Right. We got a job
to do, I know.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.970
All right, Chris,
you got the wheel.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.712
It just sounds wrong.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.019
All right, here.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.195
Haven't been in a
vehicle I wasn't driving

14:08.238 --> 14:10.066
in I can't even
remember how long.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.765
[engine starts]

14:13.809 --> 14:17.204
Yeah. It was the scariest thing
that ever happened to me.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.858
It was scary for me, too.
I wasn't there,

14:18.901 --> 14:22.470
but what if I had been?

14:22.513 --> 14:24.820
But in a weird way, this
brings us closer as sisters.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.431
[door closes]Ugh.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.694
Don't worry. We'll
just edit it out.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.914
We should reshoot it.
Both of you are so low energy.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.743
Well, I've had
a tough morning.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.484
[ringtone playing]

14:36.527 --> 14:39.008
It's Tristan.
He must have heard.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.358
It's been nonstop since
we got her from the airport.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.839
[laughs]
Babe!

14:43.883 --> 14:47.234
Oh, Lord. I just woke up.And I was the first
person you call?

14:47.277 --> 14:49.801
Don't be jealous because
it won't do you any good.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.892
Can she do that later?Probably. Tristan's got
a pretty tight schedule, though.

14:52.935 --> 14:57.244
Tight schedule? Didn't she
just say he's her boyfriend?Oh, they're not actually dating.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.680
It's just for the videos.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.203
They're cross-pollinating
each other's followers.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.944
Isn't Tristan the vlogger
who does the... What is it?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.685
The daily goof.Yeah. He plays these
elaborate pranks

15:03.728 --> 15:05.643
on his friends.[clears throat]

15:08.298 --> 15:10.257
Uh-oh. No-fun Sarah

15:10.300 --> 15:12.041
says I have to wrap it up.
Guess some things never change.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.869
But I promise...

15:13.913 --> 15:15.740
Hey, Tristan,
I hear you like pranks.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.917
[sighs] Yeah?Well, here's one for you.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.701
Excuse me?

15:19.744 --> 15:21.181
Tiffany, my name is
Sergeant Harrelson.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.965
I want to ask you
some questions

15:23.009 --> 15:25.185
about one of the guys who
shot up your place this morning.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.361
I thought it was
for sure about drugs.It might be,

15:27.404 --> 15:29.145
but the shooter who got away
may have been targeting you.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.974
So we might have to put you
in protective custody.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.977
Oh, God. That
sounds restrictive.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.675
So, you're saying
I'm in danger?

15:39.460 --> 15:41.201
Hey. Hey, how about

15:41.244 --> 15:43.203
we turn that thing off?Oh, we're not live-streaming.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.945
We'll edit it into the video
I just did. But don't worry.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.904
We'll make you guys look
so badass. JD's a wizard.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.305
I saw that look
on your face earlier.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.482
About the Ty and Kira thing.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.832
What kind of look?

16:03.875 --> 16:06.182
Let's just say I-I got
a sneak peek at how my aunts

16:06.226 --> 16:07.705
and uncles are gonna react.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.272
[scoffs] Come on,
I'm not that old.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.405
But you disapprove, right?

16:11.448 --> 16:13.276
You think it's...

16:13.320 --> 16:15.148
immoral or something?

16:17.063 --> 16:19.674
It's your business,
it's not mine.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.677
Come on, just
give me a real answer.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.939
You know me.
I can take it.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.683
Probably think
I'm gonna do whatever I want,

16:28.726 --> 16:31.077
and you're right.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.730
That doesn't mean
I don't respect your opinion.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.606
You want to know
if I disapprove?

16:40.086 --> 16:42.044
If your daughter
brought home a couple,

16:42.088 --> 16:44.220
how would you feel about that?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.878
[sighs]
Honestly?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.923
I'd be worried for her.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.839
That couple is
in a relationship

16:54.883 --> 16:56.798
that predates you.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.670
They're getting married,

16:59.714 --> 17:02.021
and you're not part
of that marriage,

17:02.064 --> 17:05.589
no matter how they try
to sell it to you.

17:05.633 --> 17:09.028
I think you're setting yourself
up for heartache.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.214
A hundred feet
to your two o'clock.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.824
Stay casual.
He's watching.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.784
Fits the captain's
description of the shooter.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.484
Hondo, we got a guy
across the street

17:30.527 --> 17:32.312
that looks
like our shooter.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.705
Roger that, Deac.Look, everybody
get on the ground.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.577
Stay away from the window,
all right?What's going on?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.622
What's happening?For God's sake,
Tiff, just get down.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.102
I can go around the building,

17:40.146 --> 17:41.799
make the block
and get behind him.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.714
No. Seeing you leave
might spook him, Chris.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.238
Tan, get unis
to surround the block.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.762
Luca... Hey, I said
turn that thing off!

17:51.505 --> 17:53.159
He's on the move.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.075
He's on the run.
We're in pursuit.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.078
[tires squealing]

17:59.121 --> 18:01.080
I'm with you, Deac!I got the door.

18:12.743 --> 18:13.788
He's got a gun.

18:26.714 --> 18:29.238
[door squeaks open]

18:29.282 --> 18:31.153
LAPD!

18:31.197 --> 18:31.936
Come out of the house.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.986
Did you see a guy with
a gun run through here?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.118
DEACON: All right,
go back inside.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.032
Stay away from the doors
and the windows.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.557
Hondo, check it out.

18:46.212 --> 18:49.519
He must've dropped it
on the way over.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.869
That's a .45, just like
the shooter this morning.

18:51.913 --> 18:55.221
Coming after her twice
in three hours. He's motivated.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.962
More like obsessed. He's not
gonna stop until we stop him.

19:03.229 --> 19:06.580
Guys, if the worst happens--
I don't want to say it even--

19:06.623 --> 19:08.538
but I want you to know
it was worth it for all of you.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.279
Are those your
feet or Luca's?

19:10.323 --> 19:12.412
You kidding? Luca's feet would
take up the whole frame.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.240
[sighs]
I think I just got dumber.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.590
I can't believe this is the
world my kids are growing up in.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.244
I told them
to turn that damn camera off.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.550
Videos like that'll probably
encourage this guy.

19:20.594 --> 19:23.118
All right, so who's babysitting
our little princess?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.815
Not it.Hey, I had her
all morning.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.817
[scoffs]

19:31.474 --> 19:33.389
Hey.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.262
What's up, man?

19:36.305 --> 19:38.481
Want to talk about it?

19:38.525 --> 19:40.396
You're starting
to sound like Dr. Wendy.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.006
[chuckles]
What, are you afraid

19:42.050 --> 19:43.704
they're gonna say that
accident was your fault?

19:43.747 --> 19:46.141
No, it's not that exactly.
It's just...

19:46.185 --> 19:48.883
Look, driving has been
such a big part of my life

19:48.926 --> 19:50.189
since before SWAT, even.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.234
I mean, until today,

19:52.278 --> 19:54.105
I'd never even hit a squirrel.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.672
I had a perfect driving record.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.500
Luca, you can't be perfect
all the time.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.850
Yeah, but we're SWAT. Perfect's
part of our job description.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.678
[laughs]
Come on, man.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.854
That's a part
that none of us live up to.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.248
You know, the best way
to get your mind

20:06.292 --> 20:09.120
off your own problems-- to
listen to someone else's.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.818
You got something going on?

20:10.861 --> 20:13.429
Not me. Street.

20:13.473 --> 20:16.171
He's been doing way
too much lately,

20:16.215 --> 20:17.520
but he ain't gonna want
to hear that from me.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.609
He and Chris are pretty tight.Luca.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.528
We've all seen the shade
you've been throwing his way.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.835
You lived with the
kid for months, man.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.272
And he needs his boy back.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.715
[door closes]

20:38.759 --> 20:41.109
Amy, your mom texted.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.676
They're taking
an early flight back.

20:42.719 --> 20:45.244
Yeah, I know.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.333
This is Dr. Wendy Hughes.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.378
She's a psychologist.Hi, Amy.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.075
After what happened
this morning,

20:51.119 --> 20:52.512
I thought it might be good
for the two of you to talk.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.517
Something wrong
with the sandwich?

20:57.560 --> 20:59.170
I'm not hungry.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.390
You haven't eaten all day.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.739
You think Tiffany will be okay?

21:02.783 --> 21:04.088
I think you...I bet

21:04.132 --> 21:05.960
she's plenty safe
with SWAT protecting her.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.222
They're amazing.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.702
That's right.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.358
She'll be fine.

21:12.401 --> 21:16.187
Just heard back
on the gun the guy dropped.

21:16.231 --> 21:19.190
No usable prints,
serial number filed off.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.020
Any luck on your end?

21:23.064 --> 21:24.326
Uh, not really.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.241
I mean, I hate the Internet now,

21:26.285 --> 21:28.374
so I-I guess
that's progress as a person.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.202
Look, we all notice
how you keep, uh,

21:31.246 --> 21:33.857
volunteering for the crap
assignments, on top of manning

21:33.901 --> 21:35.990
the armory on your off time.Still five more months

21:36.033 --> 21:39.428
of probation.Which means you got
to be on top of your game,

21:39.472 --> 21:41.082
not that you have
to pay some kind of penance.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.649
That's all in the past.

21:42.692 --> 21:45.695
In the past?Yeah, it's water
under the bridge.

21:45.739 --> 21:49.133
So quit burning the candle at
both ends. You look exhausted.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.701
Honestly, it's not
even the workload.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.313
It's just not knowing where
I'm sleeping any given night.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.924
My mom, she's still
at my old place.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.230
And it's just more expensive
than I thought it'd be

21:59.274 --> 22:00.797
getting a second lease.

22:00.841 --> 22:03.365
You're talking to a couch
surfing pro here. I get it.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.542
I stayed, uh, with my
old training officer

22:06.586 --> 22:08.588
for a week,
but his wife

22:08.631 --> 22:10.894
has this dog that hates me
even more than she does.[laughs]

22:10.938 --> 22:14.158
So now I'm sleeping
in my buddy's spare room

22:14.202 --> 22:15.725
in Santa Clarita.
Only last night,

22:15.769 --> 22:18.511
I forgot and drove
back to Long Beach

22:18.554 --> 22:19.816
and I didn't realize
till I was halfway there.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.165
I had no idea.

22:21.209 --> 22:24.255
Anyway, um, I'm
not complaining.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.257
I'm all done with excuses.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.046
Hello.

22:39.053 --> 22:39.967
Captain, what's up?

22:40.010 --> 22:42.143
Just checking in.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.014
SARAH: Two and a half million
views on this morning's video

22:44.058 --> 22:45.929
and over 100,000
new followers.

22:45.973 --> 22:48.889
[chuckles] Someone should try
to kill me every week.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.020
That's bad.

22:50.064 --> 22:51.065
I shouldn't say that, should I?

22:51.108 --> 22:53.023
No, you shouldn't.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.198
[clears throat]

22:54.242 --> 22:55.809
I'm Captain Cortez.

22:55.852 --> 22:58.246
Captain Cortez was at the event
this morning.

22:58.289 --> 22:59.465
She saved our lives.

22:59.508 --> 23:02.206
Oh, cool.
Girl power.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.512
So when can we go

23:03.556 --> 23:05.514
to the hospital to visit
my fans that got shot?

23:05.558 --> 23:08.256
Why? Is that gonna
get you more followers?

23:08.299 --> 23:10.476
There a problem
or something?

23:10.519 --> 23:11.433
Can we talk alone?

23:15.481 --> 23:17.396
[clears throat]

23:18.788 --> 23:21.530
Tiffany, you're a con artist.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.793
You don't really care
about your fans.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.666
[exhales]All they are to you
is views and followers.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.886
Millions of teenagers
look up to you.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.976
My niece could have gotten
killed this morning.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.718
She's traumatized.
And for what?

23:35.762 --> 23:38.939
'Cause she worships a version
of you that doesn't even exist.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.462
Well, you could say the
same thing about an actor

23:40.506 --> 23:43.073
or LeBron James.This is not a movie
or a game.

23:43.117 --> 23:46.425
You're pretending it's
your real life, but it's not.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.122
Even your boyfriend is fake.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.777
Well, my fans get it.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.214
And I bet your niece does, too.

23:53.257 --> 23:56.217
I've been doing this since
I was 15. Did you know that?

23:56.260 --> 24:00.439
I'm not the same person I was
when I was 15, but I have

24:00.482 --> 24:02.528
to act like it, because
that's what the fans want.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.878
That's the Tiffany Experience.

24:04.921 --> 24:06.401
And, by the way,

24:06.445 --> 24:07.968
I get comments all the time

24:08.011 --> 24:10.753
from fans telling me
watching myvideos

24:10.797 --> 24:13.495
keeps them from
slitting their wrists.

24:13.539 --> 24:18.108
So, maybe I'm not a completely
terrible person after all.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.982
You could be so much more.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.595
Captain, we need you.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.123
It's too fuzzy for
facial recognition

24:33.167 --> 24:35.299
but matches the
witness descriptions.

24:35.343 --> 24:37.301
I saw him only from the back,
but the clothes look right.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.173
WENDY:
I zeroed in on eight

24:39.216 --> 24:40.914
of the possible witnesses
based on the weirdo files

24:40.957 --> 24:42.263
that Sarah gave us--

24:42.306 --> 24:44.308
men whose posts
and messages to Tiffany

24:44.352 --> 24:45.527
showed the obsession

24:45.571 --> 24:47.790
and recklessness
that we are looking for.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.749
And we got a match.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.099
Pete Delkis.
Multiple recent addresses all

24:52.142 --> 24:53.927
in the Woodland
Hills-Canoga Park area,

24:53.970 --> 24:56.016
including his
parents' house.Nice job.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.104
It looks like he has priors.Criminal stalking

24:57.147 --> 24:59.367
and unlawful discharge
of a weapon.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.456
Wasn't hard for me
to single him out.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.545
Those are felonies. He shouldn't
have access to a gun.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.939
Well, if we're lucky,
it's the only one he had.
But I'm not counting on it.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.810
All right, let's tac up. With
this many addresses, we can't do

25:07.854 --> 25:09.420
no-knock entries.

25:09.464 --> 25:12.380
Luca.Yes, sir.

25:12.423 --> 25:13.555
Your driving privileges
have been reinstated.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.165
What?Street found a video

25:15.209 --> 25:17.646
of the accident. It confirms
your version of events.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.561
I had to run it up
the chain, but...

25:19.605 --> 25:21.128
you're good to go, pal.
Congratulations.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.958
Bury the lede, dude.Glad I could help, man.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.569
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chris.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.136
Hand 'em over.What?

25:29.179 --> 25:30.529
Keys.
[chuckles]

25:43.019 --> 25:46.153
It's LAPD!

25:46.196 --> 25:48.677
Open the door!

25:53.073 --> 25:56.555
MIKE: Hold your badge up
to the peephole, please.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.430
[camera clicks]

26:04.998 --> 26:06.347
Mike Delkis?

26:06.390 --> 26:07.566
Yes.

26:07.609 --> 26:08.741
May we come in?

26:15.922 --> 26:17.967
A photo
of your badge

26:18.011 --> 26:20.927
has been uploaded
to my cloud storage, Officer.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.842
We're looking for your
son, Pete. Is he here?

26:22.885 --> 26:24.104
No idea, Officer.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.759
I don't need
to cooperate with you.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.022
Do you have guns
in the house?I do.

26:29.065 --> 26:32.112
It's America still,
isn't it?Are they in a safe?

26:32.155 --> 26:34.984
Pete's got priors.
He's not supposed to have
access to any firearms.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.725
You trying to use
my son's arrests as an excuse

26:36.769 --> 26:39.598
to confiscate
my legally purchased guns?

26:39.641 --> 26:41.600
Pete shot a person
this morning, Mike.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.166
And it was likely
one of your guns.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.560
That's impossible.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.649
You own a .45?Desk drawer.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.051
HONDO:
Don't worry.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.487
He lost it hopping a fence.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.749
You got any more in the house?

27:00.793 --> 27:02.621
Yeah, 9-mil.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.448
Nightstand by my bed.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.886
What good do they do me
in a safe?

27:06.929 --> 27:08.452
Somebody breaks in,
am I supposed to run

27:08.496 --> 27:11.107
to my closet, turn the dial back
and forth while he kills me?

27:13.457 --> 27:14.850
Strike two.

27:18.593 --> 27:21.074
Copy that. He's still on
the loose, and he's still armed.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.119
Well, that's comforting.
At least Tiffany's safe here.

27:23.163 --> 27:25.556
But as long as Pete is free,
he's a danger.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.036
We just don't know
to who else.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.038
All of his posts
on Tiffany's vlogs

27:29.082 --> 27:30.561
are all about Tiffany herself.

27:30.605 --> 27:31.824
He thinks that they're
meant to be together,

27:31.867 --> 27:34.087
that only he's
good enough for her.

27:34.130 --> 27:37.090
He calls everyone on her videos
sponges, imbeciles,

27:37.133 --> 27:38.526
a lot worse.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.049
Everyone in her videos?

27:40.093 --> 27:42.051
Like her sister, Sarah?

27:42.095 --> 27:45.272
She was at the event
Pete shot up this morning.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.709
And she was at the condo
where Pete showed up there.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.059
Maybe Pete's
not after Tiffany.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.453
He could be after the people he
thinks are keeping him from her.

27:52.496 --> 27:55.369
Sarah, JD, the fake boyfriend.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.591
[quietly]:
Check it out, bro.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.289
[enthusiastically]:
Check it out, bro.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.478
[laughs]

28:17.521 --> 28:20.611
My bad, bro. Should've warned
you not to stand there!

28:20.655 --> 28:21.830
[garage door opening]

28:21.874 --> 28:23.832
Dahlia?

28:25.573 --> 28:27.401
Who's Dahlia?

28:27.444 --> 28:29.403
Who are you?

28:29.446 --> 28:31.361
How'd you get in here?

28:31.405 --> 28:33.668
When you vlog outside,
sometimes you use

28:33.712 --> 28:36.715
the keypad to
close the garage.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.542
I had to watch about a
hundred of them to piece
the code together.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.588
Y-You what?

28:41.720 --> 28:44.374
Wait, did Marty send you?

28:44.418 --> 28:46.028
[clicks tongue]
Prank war is over, Marty!

28:46.072 --> 28:47.073
Who's Dahlia?

28:49.075 --> 28:51.164
Are you cheating on Tiffany?

28:53.644 --> 28:55.472
[chuckles] You must have
the IQ of a six-year-old

28:55.516 --> 28:56.865
and you're cheating on her?

28:56.909 --> 29:00.303
Uh, hey, look,
I-I love my fans, bro,

29:00.347 --> 29:02.915
but, uh, this is trespassing,
all right?

29:02.958 --> 29:04.873
Uh...

29:04.917 --> 29:05.744
You're the guy
from this morning.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.615
Look, Tiff's not here, man!

29:07.658 --> 29:09.617
Well, that's too bad.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.750
I wish she could see
the way you're cowering,

29:11.793 --> 29:13.186
betraying your beta male traits.

29:13.229 --> 29:15.449
We're not even really dating
in real life.

29:15.492 --> 29:18.321
[phone chiming]Okay, that's just
for the followers, I swear!

29:20.584 --> 29:22.064
Police are at my house.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.110
Uh, um, maybe
I can help you out.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.676
I don't really carry cash
on me or anything.

29:31.334 --> 29:31.987
[exhales]

29:58.274 --> 30:00.059
He's dead.Left side clear.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.234
Right side clear.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.844
May not mean anything,

30:02.888 --> 30:04.237
but doesn't look
like his phone is on him.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.847
I'm guessing that's not
something you usually say

30:05.891 --> 30:07.153
about this guy.Captain,

30:07.196 --> 30:08.067
we've got a problem.

30:11.026 --> 30:13.246
Here to yell at me again?

30:13.289 --> 30:14.247
Where are Sarah and JD?

30:14.290 --> 30:16.031
Why?

30:16.075 --> 30:17.946
Because we think the
shooter is targeting them.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.513
[chuckles]:
For what reason?

30:19.556 --> 30:20.470
Tiffany, where are they?

30:20.514 --> 30:22.516
The shuttle.

30:22.559 --> 30:25.040
The Tiffany Experience
party shuttle.

30:25.084 --> 30:29.088
You said you'd shut down your
events until we found this guy.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.655
Yeah, but...

30:31.699 --> 30:34.310
he's after me, and I'm right
here, where you told me to be.

30:34.354 --> 30:37.313
Plus, I'm trending
like crazy right now,

30:37.357 --> 30:40.055
and Tristan texted
Sarah with this hot idea

30:40.099 --> 30:42.492
for me to throw a pop-up
shuttle in my honor.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.755
And he's gonna make
a surprise appearance.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.715
Tiffany,
Tristan didn't send that text.

30:49.630 --> 30:50.979
He's dead.

30:54.113 --> 30:57.029
[helicopter whirring]

31:00.989 --> 31:02.295
Hello, Tiffany fans.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.992
Uh, Tiffany's not
here right now.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.994
I'm Pete. JD's here, too.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.562
JD?

31:08.605 --> 31:10.520
[exhales]

31:10.564 --> 31:13.132
I wasn't planning on things
turning out this way,

31:13.175 --> 31:14.960
but I know some of you
will understand.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.179
I know you understand, Tiffany,
why I had to kill Tristan.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.789
It's too late for me,

31:18.833 --> 31:20.617
but I'm gonna make sure

31:20.661 --> 31:21.967
that the next real man
who truly deserves you

31:22.010 --> 31:22.968
won't be taken away from you

31:23.011 --> 31:24.578
by beta-male sponges

31:24.621 --> 31:26.014
and bitch gatekeepers.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.364
[sirens wailing]

31:33.630 --> 31:35.284
Where's CHP
with that spike strip?

31:35.328 --> 31:37.330
Best they can promise
is the Roscoe intersection.

31:37.373 --> 31:38.809
That's four miles out.

31:38.853 --> 31:40.246
Captain, this guy's hot.
Is there any way

31:40.289 --> 31:41.334
they can move it up
a few streets?

31:41.377 --> 31:42.204
Working on it.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.948
CHRIS:
Even if we get it stopped,

31:46.992 --> 31:48.123
the tint on that thing
is too dark

31:48.167 --> 31:49.951
to get a clean shot.We might be able

31:49.995 --> 31:52.171
to sneak someone in through
the rear luggage compartment.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.172
Whatever our entry point is,
as long as he's live-streaming,

31:53.215 --> 31:54.695
we'll know
exactly where he is

31:54.738 --> 31:56.523
on the shuttle.And which way he's looking.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.829
With enough time,
we can get someone in there
while he's distracted.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.092
All right, I like it, but if
we don't stop this thing soon,

32:00.135 --> 32:01.049
it's not gonna matter.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.752
I see some of you

32:08.796 --> 32:11.973
are asking me why I'm
live-streaming this right now.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.106
Why not just kill these two
like I did Tristan? Okay.

32:16.195 --> 32:18.588
Over 200,000 viewers

32:18.632 --> 32:21.287
and climbing. Over 200,000
of you get to hear directly

32:21.330 --> 32:22.984
from me why I have to do this.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.682
And then when I get
to a million...

32:25.726 --> 32:28.990
What is it that-that
Tiffany always says?

32:29.034 --> 32:31.688
She says,
"You know you've made it

32:31.732 --> 32:34.735
when you get a million views."

32:34.778 --> 32:35.910
Please, is there anything...

32:35.954 --> 32:38.434
Just stay out of the way.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.871
I wanted to get
those million with you, Tiff.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.700
I did.

32:43.744 --> 32:48.314
But at least I'm going
to make it. Right?

32:48.357 --> 32:50.969
So come on, Tiffany fans,
let's rally, let's do this.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.188
As soon as we get to a million,

32:53.232 --> 32:54.755
you're gonna see these leeches
get what they deserve.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.626
He's waiting for a million
viewers before he shoots them.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.849
HONDO: Captain, if we shut down
his live stream,

33:01.892 --> 33:04.025
he might start killing them
right then and there.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.419
A million viewers. That-that
should give us enough time.

33:06.462 --> 33:07.855
No one with a conscience
is gonna tune in now.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.291
Hondo.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.033
It's climbing faster.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.035
No.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.297
A lot faster.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.473
We're not gonna make it
to that spike strip

33:17.517 --> 33:18.997
before he pulls the trigger.

33:25.090 --> 33:29.224
[sirens wailing]

33:29.268 --> 33:31.574
Over 700,000 viewers
on Pete's live stream now.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.054
If we don't get to that
shuttle before he hits

33:33.098 --> 33:34.534
a million, those
hostages are dead.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.058
Does CHP have any cars in
the area with a mobile spike?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.538
On its way
but it's ten minutes out.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.366
He's gonna hit a million
way before that.

33:40.409 --> 33:41.976
Can they PIT maneuver
something that big?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.717
No way, not with a cruiser.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.762
Black Betty could.

33:45.806 --> 33:48.026
Hey, Luca.You read my mind.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.897
You sure this thing's
nimble enough?I'm gonna make it nimble enough.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.030
It's dangerous.You see any other options?

33:52.073 --> 33:54.380
All right, Tan.
We got to time this

33:54.423 --> 33:56.382
to when Pete's gun
is turned away from Sarah.

33:56.425 --> 33:57.992
Captain, tell CHP
to make room for us

33:58.036 --> 33:59.689
at the front of that convoy.

33:59.733 --> 34:00.734
Good to have you back
in that hot seat, Luca.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.268
You know, I personally
handed you my audition packet

34:13.312 --> 34:15.444
three months ago.SARAH: Sor-- I'm sorry.

34:15.488 --> 34:19.535
We-we get so many. It probably
just got lost, that's all.

34:23.235 --> 34:26.281
You can't trick me,
Sarah. Okay?

34:26.325 --> 34:28.457
Maybe you can fool soy-faced

34:28.501 --> 34:29.937
cucks like JD here,
but not me, all right?

34:34.289 --> 34:37.118
I tried to give the packet
to you, Tiff,

34:37.162 --> 34:39.120
but, well, Sarah said
I had to wait

34:39.164 --> 34:40.295
in the back of the line all day,

34:40.339 --> 34:41.557
and then when
I finally got there,

34:41.601 --> 34:42.993
she ended the meet and greet

34:43.037 --> 34:44.082
before I could see you.
How convenient.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.268
Wait.

34:57.617 --> 34:58.313
PETE:
Almost there.

35:04.058 --> 35:05.407
Go, Luca![tires screeching]

35:12.545 --> 35:14.590
Get in the back.
Get in the back.

35:14.634 --> 35:17.027
Chris, you're with me.

35:17.071 --> 35:18.507
Tan, we need a window.
Let us know which one.

35:18.551 --> 35:22.337
Keep videoing. If the police
try to come in here,

35:22.381 --> 35:24.426
I'm gonna kill these two
right away.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.427
Deac, be ready to port
the window.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.124
Wait for my enter command.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.045
Where they at, Tan?Side window.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.090
Hostages in the rear.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.439
Chris, move. Street, move.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.140
5,000 viewers away.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.099
Chris, you good?I'm good.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.231
[grunts]

35:48.537 --> 35:51.149
All right, here we go.

35:51.192 --> 35:54.021
Three. Two. Now.

35:57.546 --> 35:58.460
Go! Go!

36:02.247 --> 36:03.509
STREET:
Clear right!

36:03.552 --> 36:06.251
[crying]

36:06.294 --> 36:08.557
Suspect's down.
Both hostages safe.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.178
[sighs]

36:22.354 --> 36:23.485
Did you get the guy?

36:23.529 --> 36:25.183
We got him.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.706
And it looks like you got
your appetite back.

36:26.749 --> 36:27.750
WENDY:
We ordered pizza.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.099
Hope you don't mind.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.145
Thank you for staying with her.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.755
No, thank you.
It was my pleasure.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.540
I've been dealing with
an empty nest lately

36:34.583 --> 36:36.890
since my twin girls went off
to college.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.196
Where did they end up going?

36:38.239 --> 36:40.198
Middlebury and Colgate.

36:40.241 --> 36:43.549
So far away.
I really miss them, so...

36:43.592 --> 36:45.768
Thank you for making
my day, Amy.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.988
Thanks.You're welcome.

36:48.031 --> 36:51.209
Tiffany's still here, you know.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.907
Maybe she'll do
a video with you.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.779
I bet you'd get more viewers
than that girl at your school.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.260
I don't know.

36:59.304 --> 37:02.045
Reconsidering
the vlogging career?

37:02.089 --> 37:03.786
I just think
I might want to talk

37:03.830 --> 37:07.007
about more important stuff...
after today, you know.

37:07.050 --> 37:10.140
I was thinking maybe I could do
one with you, actually.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.057
If you're okay with that.

37:16.451 --> 37:19.280
Hey, Street.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.977
Hey, yo, some fancy
driving today.
Wait up.

37:21.021 --> 37:23.719
Yeah, thanks to you.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.418
Hey, so, you know, what we
were talking about earlier--

37:26.461 --> 37:28.071
water under the
bridge and all that.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.639
Look, everyone
was pissed at me.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.032
For good reason.

37:32.075 --> 37:33.294
I get it.No, I wasn't pissed.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.992
Look, okay, yeah,
I was pissed.

37:36.036 --> 37:38.386
But that's not why I was
so hard on you in the academy.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.997
Okay, you might
think because of

37:41.041 --> 37:42.825
who my dad and my granddad were,
that they were in SWAT,

37:42.869 --> 37:44.349
that I was a shoo-in.

37:44.392 --> 37:45.828
But the truth is
that the instructors

37:45.872 --> 37:48.570
were harder on me
than anyone else.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.355
Okay, they didn't
want anybody in SWAT

37:50.398 --> 37:52.313
because of who their dad was.

37:52.357 --> 37:56.709
So they needed to see that I
wanted it more than anyone else.

37:58.885 --> 38:02.105
That's what I needed
to see from you.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.545
I appreciate
the second chance, man.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.768
So we gonna bunk together
again or what, man?

38:12.812 --> 38:15.771
I mean, look, I got this new
house in East Hollywood, right.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.599
I'm still fixing it up.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.253
It's a two bedroom;
I'm only using one.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.515
You helped me out
when I needed a place,

38:20.559 --> 38:21.777
so just don't say no, man.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.431
Come on, just...Stop. Stop.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.262
You had me at...

38:28.306 --> 38:30.612
whatever the first word
in that sentence was.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.092
[both laugh]

38:35.356 --> 38:38.707
About our conversation
last night...

38:38.751 --> 38:40.361
For something you don't
want to think about,

38:40.405 --> 38:42.363
you sure keep
bringing it up.

38:42.407 --> 38:45.410
I just want you to know
I'm grateful.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.934
And I don't mean
paying for that lamp.

38:47.977 --> 38:50.458
I mean for the way
you handled it when it happened.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.330
The fact that you don't look
at me any different after that.

38:52.373 --> 38:55.898
Hondo, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

38:55.942 --> 39:00.338
Listen, my ex-husband
has a lot of issues.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.775
Hmm. Oh, I noticed.
[chuckles]

39:02.818 --> 39:05.212
But issues only
become problems

39:05.255 --> 39:08.389
when you refuse to accept
you have them, like he does.

39:08.433 --> 39:11.653
Or when you refuse
to acknowledge

39:11.697 --> 39:13.438
the fact that
you're not perfect.

39:13.481 --> 39:18.051
You've got weaknesses
like everybody else.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.404
You know,
there's a guy on my team

39:23.448 --> 39:26.102
who was letting old business
screw up a friendship,

39:26.146 --> 39:28.322
and I said something similar
to him.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.890
Sounds like you just need to
take your own advice, then.

39:30.933 --> 39:34.023
Hmm.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.285
Acknowledge the issue.

39:35.329 --> 39:37.113
Accept the issue.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.551
Is there another "A"
you want to throw in there?

39:39.594 --> 39:41.335
[both laugh]

39:41.379 --> 39:44.425
How about "address"
the issue?

39:44.469 --> 39:46.645
That anger I saw in Tucson

39:46.688 --> 39:49.343
was not just about that
ass of a traffic cop.

39:49.387 --> 39:53.826
There's no way that one guy
got you wound up like that.

39:53.869 --> 39:58.439
There has to be more...
that's been built up.

40:00.746 --> 40:03.444
But you got it out of
your system for now.

40:03.488 --> 40:07.492
So now it's just about keeping
it out of your system.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.366
Yeah.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.069
I hope you're right.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.420
Of course I am.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.609
That was all over my
feed today. That was you?

40:37.652 --> 40:39.480
And the rest
of my team, yeah.

40:39.524 --> 40:40.699
Just a day in
the life, huh?

40:40.742 --> 40:42.091
It was crazy.
It can be.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.484
Or it can be just sitting around
all day

40:43.528 --> 40:45.094
waiting in HQ for a call.

40:45.138 --> 40:47.140
Yeah, a lot like my job.

40:47.183 --> 40:49.751
Yeah, I hear painting's
dangerous work.

40:49.795 --> 40:52.450
I mean, those fumes can
be so toxic, you know.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.451
Oh, my God.

40:53.494 --> 40:56.497
[laughs] Uh, all right.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.934
So, you obviously didn't come
here for my amazing jokes.

40:58.978 --> 41:01.937
Mm-mm.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.070
I, um...

41:04.113 --> 41:09.162
I've been thinking
a lot about this today,

41:09.205 --> 41:11.512
and-and the truth is,

41:11.556 --> 41:15.385
I-I already knew
I wanted to do this,

41:15.429 --> 41:17.649
but I was worried about

41:17.692 --> 41:19.564
what people would think.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.522
Actually, I had to deal
with that today

41:21.566 --> 41:23.089
with a member of my team.

41:23.132 --> 41:24.699
And how'd it go?

41:24.743 --> 41:27.963
Actually, it was... it was fine.

41:28.007 --> 41:31.227
People are surprisingly tolerant
when you give them a chance.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.316
He did make
one good point though.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.058
The two of you,

41:36.102 --> 41:38.017
you guys are getting married.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.324
You both are entering a lifelong
commitment with each other.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.546
It makes it really hard

41:45.590 --> 41:49.376
not to think of my position
as just temporary.

41:49.419 --> 41:50.986
Yes, we are
getting married.

41:51.030 --> 41:54.512
But if we start
a relationship with you,

41:54.555 --> 41:57.079
you will be an equal part
in that new relationship.

41:57.123 --> 41:59.081
TY:
And it's better this way,
don't you think?

41:59.125 --> 42:01.519
I mean, this way
you don't have to worry

42:01.562 --> 42:03.869
about your relationship
with each of us separately.

42:03.912 --> 42:07.046
There's just one question:

42:07.089 --> 42:10.571
how do you mesh with the two
of us as a unit?

42:10.615 --> 42:12.486
♪ There are things

42:12.530 --> 42:16.229
♪ That I would never say or do

42:16.272 --> 42:17.578
♪ There are things...

42:17.622 --> 42:18.710
I think... [laughs]

42:18.753 --> 42:21.277
I think I'm ready to mesh.

42:21.321 --> 42:25.543

never say or do ♪

42:25.586 --> 42:28.284
