00:07.675 --> 00:10.219
Okay, open on Kimmy and Titus
walking down the street.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.345
Titus, looking amazing:

00:11.429 --> 00:13.097
How's your little
love triangle going?

00:13.180 --> 00:14.223
Nope.
Next topic.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.349
How dare you?

00:15.433 --> 00:16.642
For the last three months,
it's been,

00:16.726 --> 00:17.977
"What's the Internet?
Who's that guy?

00:18.060 --> 00:19.186
What's Tilda Swinton?"

00:19.270 --> 00:20.521
And I have told you:

00:20.605 --> 00:22.941
"Tubes, the president,
and no one knows."

00:23.023 --> 00:25.234
And now you have something
juicy happening--

00:25.317 --> 00:26.736
Look, this is not fun for me.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.821
I mean, Logan got into a fight
with Dong,

00:28.905 --> 00:30.072
because Dong likes me?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.657
Enjoy the attention, woman.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.576
The last time I had two men
fighting over me,

00:33.659 --> 00:35.995
I was a table at a Fire Island
arm wrestling match.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.830
Enjoy it?
I feel sick to my stomach.

00:37.914 --> 00:39.164
I mean, what do I even say
to them?

00:39.248 --> 00:40.959
Is that dolphin with a bow
on it?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.418
No, you wouldn't say that.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.253
Wait.
What?

00:44.336 --> 00:46.631
Kimmy, I wanted to apologize
for last night.

00:47.632 --> 00:49.508
I recalled that you said
you like dolphins.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.093
Oh, don't worry.
He can breathe.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.428
He's a mammal.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.013
[screeching]

00:54.096 --> 00:56.766
- Where would I even put it?
- Make it stop looking at me!

01:25.962 --> 01:29.007
Kimmy, I truly regret
my behavior,

01:29.089 --> 01:31.133
but I think I reacted that way

01:31.216 --> 01:32.635
because I really care about you.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.137
Well, what would the Care Bears
say about how you show it?

01:35.220 --> 01:36.806
It would depend on the bear,
Kimmy.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.975
The point is, I overreacted.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.894
I'm just not used to obstacles.

01:41.978 --> 01:43.521
When I summited Mount Everest,

01:43.604 --> 01:45.356
I did it in my daddy's
private blimp.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.858
To be honest, I've never even

01:46.941 --> 01:48.651
seen the inside
of a public blimp.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.653
[laughs]
What can I say?

01:50.736 --> 01:52.363
I'm a bit of a Daddy's Boy.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.866
- Is that a thing?
- Of course it is.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.035
You've heard of a Mama's Boy,
right?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.619
Although frankly I don't see
the appeal.

01:58.703 --> 02:01.831
Look, you're my boyfriend.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.290
Dong is just my friend.

02:03.374 --> 02:04.625
But he wants more than that.

02:04.709 --> 02:07.211
He wants to shoop, baby.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.505
- Shoop.
- I know.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.215
So I will tell him
that I picked you.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.633
You have to do more than that.

02:12.717 --> 02:14.426
You need to cut him off
completely.

02:14.510 --> 02:17.013
You want me to tell Dong that
we can't be friends anymore?

02:17.096 --> 02:18.430
It's for his sake.

02:18.514 --> 02:21.183
If you stay friends, he's always
gonna want more.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.810
Better to just end it now.

02:22.894 --> 02:26.022
And you know what I find
helps soften bad news?

02:26.105 --> 02:28.024
A British accent.

02:28.107 --> 02:31.151
The dolphin died
on the sidewalk.

02:50.546 --> 02:53.173

kidnapped think is scary.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.299

a talking crow.

Did I tell you? I auditioned to be
a replacement mad scientist?

03:04.268 --> 03:05.394
He gets a monologue,

03:05.477 --> 03:07.396
and he doesn't have to clean
the ladies' room.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.856
Women are disgusting, BT-dubs.

Titus, I'm so excited for you.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.234
I'm exciting.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.320
Now, who got the role
of Kimmy's boyfriend?

03:15.404 --> 03:16.864
I've officially picked Logan.

03:16.948 --> 03:18.490
Okay. Great.

03:18.574 --> 03:19.658
Wait.

03:19.742 --> 03:22.202
Is it gonna be up to me to
teach you about birth control?

03:22.286 --> 03:24.622
Probably.
But not yet.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.333
On our third date,
Logan and I had a mishap.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.752
Can we take this
to the next level?

Oh, my spine! My--

03:35.299 --> 03:37.927
Apparently all the stuff
I thought I knew was way wrong.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.720
He passed out for a second.

03:39.804 --> 03:42.056
So I told him
I want to wait a while.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.182
Oh.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.059
That's why he went full dolphin
for you.

03:45.143 --> 03:47.478
I bet nobody's made that
rich boy wait for anything.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.480
Titus, do you think it's weird

03:49.563 --> 03:52.024
that Logan wants me to stop
being friends with Dong?

03:52.108 --> 03:53.484
Honestly, no.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.944
There's nothing worse
than thinking

03:55.027 --> 03:56.070
you have a shot at something

as straight.

marrying The Cyclops Bride.

We are here today to discuss
the terms of the divorce

05:03.262 --> 05:06.557
of Julian and Jacqueline

- They're getting divorced?

to assure you

that it's not your fault,

initial here

that you received a hug.

And here to acknowledge
that you were comforted.

who makes up words.

06:01.612 --> 06:02.654
Like "snowbesity."

if someone's fat or not

06:04.364 --> 06:05.616
'cause they're wearing
a winter coat.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.743
But then I turned my career
around,

06:07.826 --> 06:11.371
thanks to Le Loup.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.497
For realsies?

06:12.581 --> 06:13.624
For realisingtons.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.877
He's tough, but last month,
I booked a radio ad

06:16.961 --> 06:18.754
for a paintball range.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.299
The straightest of all

Okay.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.972

are getting divorced.

Two Christmases!
Yes!

06:30.891 --> 06:32.476
You bitch.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.645
A female dog?
The thing that makes puppies?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.021
Nice compliment, Xan.

06:36.105 --> 06:38.690
Why would you tell Jacqueline
to divorce my dad?

06:38.774 --> 06:40.985
Now she's stripping our Hamptons
house for copper wire,

06:41.068 --> 06:42.402
and I have to go live
in Connecticut

06:42.486 --> 06:45.323
with my mom and Roger
and their gross babies.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.448
Okay, first of all,

06:46.531 --> 06:47.574
I never made your stepmom
do anything,

06:47.658 --> 06:50.244
except for the time she made me
make her eat a peanut M&M.

by someone so stupid?

06:57.876 --> 06:59.586
Hi, Mom.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.885
So are you all packed?

07:06.969 --> 07:09.721
Remember, it's colder here
than it is in the city.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.140
Do you have enough
corduroy slacks

07:11.223 --> 07:13.225
with the little waterfowl
stitched in them?

07:13.309 --> 07:14.518
What? No.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.354
The lawyer said I don't move
until the end of the semester.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.147
Yes, but I'm going to be
putting up my jams that week,

07:18.230 --> 07:19.773
so I'm coming to get you
tomorrow.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.525
What?
No.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.110
No, you can't do that.

07:23.194 --> 07:24.736
My God, Xanthippe.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.738
The histrionics are not going
to fly in this house,

07:26.822 --> 07:28.824
especially around
the quintuplets.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.201
And Roger has taken up

07:30.284 --> 07:32.411
mental golfing
where he uses his mind

07:32.494 --> 07:34.955
to play some of the world's
most famous courses.

07:35.039 --> 07:36.498
So I really hope we're getting

07:36.581 --> 07:37.916
the nice quiet Xan,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.919

she invented teen angst.

[Roger]
Helene, please!

07:44.215 --> 07:46.550
I'm playing St. Andrews,
and it's very windy.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.885
This is BS.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.262
The only BS around here
is butternut squash,

07:50.346 --> 07:52.348
one of the dozens of varieties
of squash I grow.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.682
I hope you like squash.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.684
Also, tomorrow
we're playing squash

07:55.767 --> 07:57.269
against the Squashes.

07:57.353 --> 07:58.396
See you then.

07:59.397 --> 08:00.439
I can't live there.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.483
I just need to talk
to my father.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.652
He can't say no
to his Daddy's Girl.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.112
Oh, see, that sounds
like a thing.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.365
But he's at his Captain Phillips
fantasy camp until Monday.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.491
I need to stall.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.993
You!
You have to help me.

08:13.077 --> 08:14.578
Uh, no.
This is none of my beeswax.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.704
I don't want to interfere.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.831
Kimmy, put yourself
in my shoes.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.584
Oh, my God!
Not literally.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.920
It's like talking to a chicken.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.340
Imagine you're 15,

08:26.424 --> 08:29.551
and one day your whole life
gets taken from you:

08:29.634 --> 08:33.013
your school,
your friends,

08:33.097 --> 08:34.765
your dad's friend
who buys you jewelry

08:34.848 --> 08:36.516
if you send him
your old retainers.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.148
Okay, Xan.
What are we gonna do?

08:43.232 --> 08:45.943
We're gonna make
my mom refuse

08:46.026 --> 08:48.070
to take me back
to Connecticut.

08:50.114 --> 08:52.950
Hello?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.826
Mr. Le Loup?

08:57.829 --> 08:59.081
Hello.
Hi.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.250
Rick Barnes gave me your name.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.001
He said that you work
with actors

09:03.085 --> 09:04.420
to help them "ass-pay."

09:04.503 --> 09:06.046
That was Pig Latin for "pass."

09:06.130 --> 09:08.173
Why would I try Pig Latin
for the first time ever

09:08.257 --> 09:09.300
right now anyways?

09:09.383 --> 09:10.426
So stupid.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.635
I can't work with you.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.054
- What?
- You have no potential.

09:14.138 --> 09:15.639
Get out.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.225
But I rode a bus to get here.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.311
A bus that went over
a drawbridge.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.772
Fine.
I don't need you!

09:25.357 --> 09:27.234
Bye, Felicia!

09:27.318 --> 09:28.360
[glass shatters]

09:28.444 --> 09:31.238
[applause]

09:31.322 --> 09:32.364
Very good.

09:32.448 --> 09:33.491
You yelled. You denied help.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.699
You broke something.

09:34.783 --> 09:35.826
That's your first lesson

09:35.909 --> 09:37.577
in behaving like a straight man.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.455
Your second lesson...

09:39.538 --> 09:42.541
Is that he is not Le Loup.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.877
- Hey.
- Yeah, what's up?

09:45.961 --> 09:47.004
Bye, Felicia.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.048
I'm gonna break you down,

09:50.132 --> 09:52.468
but by the time I put you
back together,

09:52.551 --> 09:54.928
you're gonna be pulling shorts
out of the dirty laundry

09:55.012 --> 09:57.931
and eating wings on the crapper
without even trying.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.057
Okay.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.309
Training begins immediately,

10:00.392 --> 10:02.727
because tomorrow
you have an audition

10:02.811 --> 10:04.646
for Entourage 2.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.106
Entourage 2?

10:06.190 --> 10:07.899
I can't.
Those guys are so straight.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.401
Almost too straight.

10:09.485 --> 10:10.528
Like they're compensating
for something?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.030
- Yeah.
- Two of them are.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.826
Wait, are those former clients
or role models?

10:17.909 --> 10:18.952
It begins now!

10:19.661 --> 10:20.996
I'm sorry, Dong, but--

10:21.079 --> 10:22.540
[Australian accent] Oy!
We're not mates.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.209
I'm with Logan now.
Get off of the barbie!

10:25.292 --> 10:26.877
That's not British.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.463
[Italian accent] This is-a how
you talka the British.

10:29.547 --> 10:31.840
I'ma soften the blow
by a-talka the British.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.551
Okay, that's good.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.100
I'm so sorry, Hu Zha Qi.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.227
This is your fault.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.020
I hope you die,
become ghost,

10:45.103 --> 10:46.480
fly around the room.

10:46.564 --> 10:48.732
That make everybody happy.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.986
Kimmy,
what are you doing here?

10:53.070 --> 10:54.696
What happened?
Where is everyone?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.615
Immigration raided
the restaurant.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.824
They took everyone--

10:57.908 --> 11:00.494
cooks, waiters,
dishwashers.

11:00.578 --> 11:01.786
I was out on a delivery,

11:01.870 --> 11:04.415
or else they would have
gotten me too.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.667
Thank God Fordham Law school
students smoke so much weed.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.378
Dong, that's so scary.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.381
And the owner says that they
came here looking for me.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.633
You can't stay here.
Go home!

11:14.716 --> 11:16.427
This is my home!

11:16.510 --> 11:18.554
Hu Zha Qi let me sleep
on the grill.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.764
If you time it right,
it's very cozy.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.892
Hey.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.018
Almost forgot this.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.144
If we don't give you a receipt,

11:26.228 --> 11:27.271
then the whole raid is free.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.064
And if that Dong Nguyen
comes back,

11:29.147 --> 11:30.441
you guys let us know.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.443
[with American accent]
You got it, chief.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.781
That's it.
You're coming with me.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.077
You can sleep on the couch.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.079
Oh, no.
Is that my leg hole?

11:44.162 --> 11:45.205
It's okay.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.415
I'm pretty good friends

11:46.498 --> 11:47.541
with the pregnant raccoon
who lives in there.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.461
Kimmy, I'm afraid I ruined
everything between us.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.921
Look, Dong,
it's not anyone's fault.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.006
It's just, I have so much fun
with you.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.801
Remember when we took the tram
to Roosevelt Island?

11:57.884 --> 12:00.596
And we realized it was just one
wire holding us up?

12:00.679 --> 12:02.306
We started screaming
and screaming,

12:02.389 --> 12:04.558
and then all the commuters
started screaming too.

12:04.642 --> 12:06.726
Because they were seeing it
through our eyes.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.647
[laughter]

12:09.729 --> 12:11.649
And we agree on everything,
Kimmy.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.358
Like how it's so weird
that people

12:13.442 --> 12:15.402
want to "eat local."

12:15.486 --> 12:16.945
Yeah, I don't want to eat
a bird I might know.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.156
And what's with
all the bottled water?

12:19.239 --> 12:22.075
Why is everyone so thirsty
all the time?

12:22.159 --> 12:24.328
"Duh, I've been awake
for one second.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.663
I better have some water."

12:25.745 --> 12:27.205
"Oh, I better carry my water
with me

12:27.289 --> 12:29.166
while I walk
to the water store."

12:29.249 --> 12:31.126
[laughter]

12:33.462 --> 12:36.881
Listen, Dong,
I need you to know...

12:36.965 --> 12:38.717
that Logan is my boyfriend,

12:38.800 --> 12:40.594
so you and I...

12:42.095 --> 12:43.681
will just be friends.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.766
[sighs]

12:46.850 --> 12:49.060
Okay.
Friends.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.479
[cell phone ringing]

12:52.814 --> 12:54.358
Hello, Sugar Walls.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.484
Nope.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.985
All right.
Hi.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.321
Listen, my parents are blimping
into town tomorrow,

12:59.404 --> 13:01.781
and I would love it if you would
join us for dinner.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.409
Your parents?
Boy.

13:04.493 --> 13:05.577
Okay.
Sure.

13:05.661 --> 13:06.704
Wonderful.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.997
So they're landing sometime
between 4:00 and 7:00,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.709
somewhere between 45th Street
and Bucks County.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.917
- [horse neighs]
- Easy, girl.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.294
Okay.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.420
I can't wait for you
to meet Mom,

13:15.504 --> 13:16.714
but especially Daddy.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.839
Oh, Kimmy,

13:17.922 --> 13:19.341
I'm so glad we were able to put

13:19.424 --> 13:21.635
all that unpleasantness
behind us.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.888
Uh...
me, too.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.306
Till then.

13:26.931 --> 13:27.974
Come on, darling.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.143
That's right.
Come on.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.439
[Xan]
Oh, my God. Kimmy.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.024
This is your apartment?

13:36.107 --> 13:39.361
You're so poor.
It's perfect.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.199
Scenario: two straight men
attend a movie.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.325
Go.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.663
No!

13:49.747 --> 13:51.248
You leave a buffer seat.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.877
Scenario: you're thirsty.
Go.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.422
No.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.340
Straight men don't drink
through straws.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.884
It looks like you're [bleep]
a leprechaun's [bleep].

14:04.678 --> 14:06.137
Scenario:

14:06.221 --> 14:07.264
I'm a coworker,

14:07.347 --> 14:10.141
telling you a sad story
at a bar after work.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.686
I go, "My wife, she's so sick.

14:12.770 --> 14:15.480
She got Ebola
from a toilet seat."

14:15.564 --> 14:16.690
[clicking tongue]

14:16.774 --> 14:18.233
No!

14:18.316 --> 14:20.110
First of all,
you're drinking beer.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.903
And straight men never give
any indication

14:21.986 --> 14:23.029
they're listening.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.364
They don't even nod.

14:24.448 --> 14:27.992
Now, you listen,
stone-faced, like a man,

14:28.076 --> 14:29.244
no matter what!

14:29.327 --> 14:31.580
Elton John just died.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.416
I like acid-washed jeans.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.334
Madonna is overrated!

14:36.418 --> 14:37.877
[squealing]

14:46.845 --> 14:48.888
Xanthippe Lannister Voorhees,

14:48.972 --> 14:50.307
if this is your idea of a joke,

14:50.390 --> 14:51.683
you belong in a Woody Allen film

14:51.767 --> 14:53.644
because I am not laughing.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.813
I am at the address you sent me.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.773
I'm going to ring the buzzer,

14:57.856 --> 14:59.399
but if I get murdered,

14:59.483 --> 15:01.025
for God's sake,

15:01.109 --> 15:03.445
drag my body below 96th Street,

15:03.528 --> 15:05.363
then call the police.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.408
[door buzzer]

15:08.492 --> 15:10.076
Okay, that's her.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.334
[knock on door]

15:18.543 --> 15:19.837
Far out.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.340
You must be Xan's old lady.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.966
Is this a root cellar?

15:25.300 --> 15:28.261
[arrhythmic drumming]

15:28.345 --> 15:29.554
Hey, Mom.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.640
Quick question: is my room
in Connecticut

15:31.723 --> 15:33.391
big enough for my drum set?

15:34.893 --> 15:36.269
What is going on here,
young lady?

15:36.353 --> 15:37.479
Get in the car!

15:37.562 --> 15:38.605
But my black boyfriend

15:38.689 --> 15:41.358
is coming by with rum.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.151
What's up, fellow prostitutes?

15:43.234 --> 15:46.404
Where's all the money
from the drugs you smoked?

15:46.488 --> 15:47.698
Be cool, man.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.908
Not in front of my mom.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.243
Kimmy, pay Cobra.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.872
Uh, but I don't have
any money.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.832
Then pay him with your body.

15:56.915 --> 15:57.957
[Helene]
Oh, good God.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.548
Hey!
Hands off my girlfriend.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.090
And you're dating a gay guy?

16:06.174 --> 16:07.217
Sure.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.469
I told him he could stay in Grandmère's
old room in Connecticut.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.304
No, no.
I don't think so.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.681
I'm taking you back
to the townhouse

16:12.764 --> 16:14.516
and letting your father
deal with you.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.769
Even Le Loup can't help me.

16:17.853 --> 16:21.272
I'll never be E's wingman
at the vodka release party.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.866
Kimmy, I don't think I can
just be your friend.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.242
What are you saying?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.285
I can't pretend I don't have
feelings for you anymore.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.579
I'm sorry.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.247
I can't stay here.

16:38.707 --> 16:39.875
But where are you gonna go?

16:41.418 --> 16:43.169
Probably the Mount Airy Lodge.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.213
The commercial says
all I have to bring

16:45.296 --> 16:46.965
is my love of everything.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.592
And that's all I have.

16:56.767 --> 16:57.809
[soft laughter]

16:57.893 --> 16:59.728
Hey!
Messy Marvins!

16:59.811 --> 17:01.813
No underage drinking
on my watch.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.189
Actually, I have a note
from my parents

17:03.273 --> 17:06.568
that says if it's over $75
a bottle, it's educational.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.821
What? No.
Go do a puzzle or something.

17:09.905 --> 17:12.365
Oh, my God.
Classic whoever-you-are.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.909
I saved your life once.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.332
Hey, Kimmy.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.293
I just want to thank you,
seriously.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.502
I get to stay in Manhattan.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.504
If you had friends, you'd
understand what this feels like.

17:26.588 --> 17:27.756
You're welcome.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.384
It's soda.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.219
I kind of hate Merlot.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.596
Hey, Xan, this is weird,

17:34.679 --> 17:37.766
but have you ever been
in a love triangle before?

17:37.849 --> 17:39.392
That Lucite pyramid
in Jacqueline's room?

17:39.476 --> 17:40.518
Or are you saying two guys
are into you?

17:40.602 --> 17:41.937
Because either way, gross.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.231
A friend of mine told me
that he liked me,

17:45.315 --> 17:47.150
and I think I may have
screwed everything up.

17:47.233 --> 17:51.905
Well, you know that I've
never, like, had a boyfriend.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.698
I mean, I made out with Cheshire
a couple times,

17:53.782 --> 17:55.325
and I think he's gonna break up
with Gengi

17:55.408 --> 17:57.160
because she's his
adopted sister.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.912
[giggling]

18:00.705 --> 18:03.041
Oh, my God.
He doesn't like me.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.334
He's just using me so
his parents don't find out

18:04.417 --> 18:06.336
he's hooking up with his sister.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.379

18:18.306 --> 18:21.351
Terry, I'll have
a beer drink.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.727
I'm not working today.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.646

for Entourage 2.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.316
[exhales sharply]

18:34.031 --> 18:35.740
Mm.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.284
Oh, I'll never pass.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.410
[sighs]

18:40.996 --> 18:44.082
"Yo, if her face is half as good
as her ass,

18:44.165 --> 18:48.294
I'm gonna greenlight her
back nine with my front four."

18:48.378 --> 18:49.796
Oh, yi-yi-yi.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.130

18:51.214 --> 18:52.256
Commit!

as her ass,

back nine with my front four."

19:00.431 --> 19:02.266
Hey, what'd you say?

19:02.350 --> 19:04.686

Nothing.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.937
Wait.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.188
Did you think I was hitting
on her?

19:07.271 --> 19:09.733
Yeah, horn dog, I do.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.651
Well, tell your lady

19:11.735 --> 19:14.487
I want to greenlight her chest
with--

19:14.571 --> 19:16.239
and bang stuff.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.490
Ew!

19:19.367 --> 19:20.660
I'm passing for straight.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.662
I'm passing for straight!

19:22.746 --> 19:25.665
I'm passing for straight!

19:25.749 --> 19:26.833
Of course you are.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.293
You've always been able
to pass for straight, Titus.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.462
The only person you needed
to audition for

19:31.546 --> 19:32.964
was yourself.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.132
You mean?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.800
There is no
Entourage 2 audition.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.302
[chuckles]
There is no Entourage 2.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.179
Oh, thank God.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.641
There is no Entourage 2!

19:43.725 --> 19:45.769
There is no Entourage 2!

[cheers and applause]

19:51.190 --> 19:52.233

19:53.401 --> 19:54.569
I can't find my phone.

19:54.652 --> 19:55.862
Dude, come over here.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.030
I'm cyber-bullying
Mr. Finkel.

19:57.114 --> 19:58.364
I'm pretending to be
his ex-wife,

19:58.448 --> 19:59.866
and he's buying it.

19:59.950 --> 20:03.536
"If you still love me,
come over right now

20:03.620 --> 20:05.956
and kill my boyfriend."

20:06.039 --> 20:07.165
[laughter]

20:07.248 --> 20:09.042
Xanthippe,
what is going on?

20:09.126 --> 20:10.293
What are you doing here?

20:10.627 --> 20:11.795
I did!

20:13.212 --> 20:14.255
I couldn't really hear in there.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.632
Did your mom not just say,

20:15.715 --> 20:17.467
"If you didn't send these texts
from your phone, who did?"

20:17.550 --> 20:19.677
What the hell are you doing?

20:19.761 --> 20:22.013
Mrs. Xan's Real Mom,
I'm not a crack whore.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.140
I'm Kimmy.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.849
You texted me?

20:24.933 --> 20:27.226
That explains why you spelled
"Xanthippe" wrong.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.854
- Z-E-H--
- No. Wrong. Stop.

20:29.938 --> 20:30.981
The point is,

20:31.064 --> 20:32.107
we tricked you earlier.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.232
That wasn't a crack den.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.358
That was...

20:34.442 --> 20:35.610
the home of some loser
I know.

20:35.693 --> 20:36.820
She's crazy, mom

20:36.903 --> 20:37.946
From the drugs.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.614
I only did it because
I thought I was helping

20:39.697 --> 20:40.740
your daughter,

20:40.824 --> 20:43.242
keeping her from having
her life tooken away.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.495
I'm sorry, did you just say
"tooken" instead of "taken"?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.871
Of course not.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.123
But then I realized,

20:48.206 --> 20:49.666
her friends are just the worst.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.709
Simone is a pathological liar.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.252
Jay Z is at my house,
but he's really busy.

20:53.336 --> 20:54.378
You can't meet him.

20:54.462 --> 20:55.797
But Xan is a good kid.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.923
I know.

20:57.007 --> 20:58.049
[laughter]

20:58.133 --> 20:59.759
My brother's, like,
borderline everything,

20:59.843 --> 21:02.386
and I stole these
from his bathroom.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.764
Should we just see what happens?

21:13.023 --> 21:14.482
[laughter]

21:14.565 --> 21:15.608
That's a lie!

21:15.692 --> 21:16.901
I'm super high.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.736
I'm, like, seeing colors.

21:19.737 --> 21:23.200
[Simone]
Oh, my God.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.575
[Kimmy]
After I saw that,

21:24.659 --> 21:26.077
I did some snooping.

21:26.161 --> 21:29.622
I found Xan's report card
in her room.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.625
Straight As?
AP Latin?

21:33.543 --> 21:36.254
Also, she plays the oboe
in band.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.380
Not in a band.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.090
In band.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.051
[soft laughter]

21:41.134 --> 21:42.426
And when I saw this next one,

21:42.510 --> 21:43.761
even I couldn't help but think,

21:43.845 --> 21:46.223
"Man, this nerd is lame."

21:47.265 --> 21:49.475
It's her waterproof
birding journal.

21:51.061 --> 21:53.521
You saw a Thick-Billed Murre?
Where?

21:53.604 --> 21:56.315
Mom, I don't want to talk
about it right--

21:56.399 --> 21:59.152
It was at Turtle Pond.
It was glorious.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.612
Mrs. Mr. Voorhees' First Wife,

22:01.696 --> 22:03.823
not only do I think
it will be good for Xan

22:03.907 --> 22:05.491
to be in Connecticut,

22:05.575 --> 22:07.660
I think it will be good
for Connecticut to have Xan.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.832
I am gonna get you back
for this.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.792
I don't care
how long it takes.

22:14.876 --> 22:16.753
I will learn everything
Connecticut can teach me

22:16.836 --> 22:19.630
about revenge,
and I will make you pay!

22:25.303 --> 22:27.055
[knock on door]

22:30.641 --> 22:32.310
Oh, don't you look lovely.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.062
Aww.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.730
You also don't look lovely.

22:35.813 --> 22:36.856
That's--

22:38.066 --> 22:40.026
So here we go.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.903
Meeting the parents.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.487
With no obstacles.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.073
Here.

22:46.407 --> 22:47.533
It's like at school,

22:47.617 --> 22:48.868
when I used to run the hurdles,

22:48.952 --> 22:50.536
but they would remove
all my hurdles.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.747
That way I almost always won.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.833
Yeah.
Dong's out of the picture.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.835
He's not even in New York
anymore.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.837
He's not even
in the United States.

23:01.131 --> 23:02.757
What are you talking about?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.425
Do you know about
the immigration thing?

23:04.508 --> 23:05.802
Oh.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.470
All right, look,
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.888
I called them.

23:08.972 --> 23:10.014
What?

23:10.098 --> 23:11.308
Kimmy, that man attacked me.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.392
And he was in the country
illegally.

23:13.476 --> 23:14.518
Daddy said I should tell.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.646
That's horrible!

23:16.729 --> 23:17.855
I want you to leave.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.440
Are you kidding?

23:19.523 --> 23:20.566
Kimmy, I'll allow that perhaps

23:20.650 --> 23:21.692
it was a tad extreme,

23:21.776 --> 23:22.819
but I did it for us.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.028
There is no us.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.697
And there's no such thing
as a Daddy's Boy.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.325
Oh, really?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.660
Then what about the 1938
musical Daddy's Boy?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.787
About a sailor who gets off
his ship after months at sea

23:32.870 --> 23:34.622
and goes straight to visit
his daddy.

23:34.705 --> 23:35.748
Get out.

23:38.293 --> 23:39.502
Unbelievable.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.176
Yikes.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.885
I guess you can forget!

23:47.969 --> 23:49.428
Dong!

23:49.512 --> 23:51.306
Dong, wait!

23:51.389 --> 23:53.224
Kimmy,
what are you doing here?

23:53.308 --> 23:54.517
You can't go,

23:54.600 --> 23:55.810
'cause you're not some
Daddy's Boy

23:55.893 --> 23:58.021
who tries to dolphin me
and then blimps.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.357
I understand all those words
separately.

24:00.398 --> 24:01.482
You're kind,

24:01.565 --> 24:02.608
and you're funny,

24:02.692 --> 24:04.777
and both our names mean "penis."

24:04.861 --> 24:06.154
And I don't want to be
your friend either,

24:06.237 --> 24:07.697
'cause I like you.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.241
I mean...
I like you, like you.

24:10.325 --> 24:12.410
But I'm getting on a bus bus.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.537
Stay!

24:14.620 --> 24:16.331
Logan is out of the triangle.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.499
It's now just a regular
biangle.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.251
You mean a line?

24:20.335 --> 24:22.003
We need to work
on your geometry, Kimmy.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.922
That's right.
We do.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.348
So you'll stay?

24:33.431 --> 24:36.684
I want to, but immigration
is looking for me.

24:36.767 --> 24:37.810
So?

24:37.894 --> 24:39.937
It took the police 15 years
to find me.

24:40.021 --> 24:43.149
Nothing. Hi.
Gilligan!

24:43.233 --> 24:45.526
Kimmy, if we want to date,

24:45.609 --> 24:49.822
just to be safe, we should
probably get married first.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.157
A Dong says what?

24:51.241 --> 24:52.616
I know, it's pretty crazy,

24:52.700 --> 24:54.327
but just think about it, okay?

24:54.411 --> 24:58.581
No pressure.
But I'm in jeopardy every day.
