WEBVTT

02:19.837 --> 02:23.847
- He looks so peaceful.
- No. He looks dead.

02:26.677 --> 02:31.351
Just kidding. Who's paying
for all this anyway?

03:08.511 --> 03:11.643
Excuse me. I'm very sorry.

04:24.378 --> 04:29.765
- What do you think?
- I understand Jim has new dentures too.

04:33.012 --> 04:37.484
"Priest murdered in Catholic hospital."
Has a nice ring to it.

04:37.641 --> 04:40.774
It'll sell. What do you want to do?

04:40.936 --> 04:43.701
A nurse is avoiding me.
She knows something.

04:43.856 --> 04:47.368
- Why aren't the police investigating?
- No one's making a complaint.

04:47.526 --> 04:51.667
Shut the door!

04:53.407 --> 04:56.504
Ody's in the ground already, right?

04:57.578 --> 05:02.502
A story like this takes too
long, starts to stink.

05:02.666 --> 05:06.261
Give me a day. Two days.

05:13.844 --> 05:16.181
- Ob.
- Hi, Ann.

05:17.348 --> 05:21.738
These are for you. They're from my kids.

05:21.894 --> 05:27.577
If you could make a comment or two
in the margins to show you looked at 'em.

05:27.733 --> 05:31.197
- Have you eaten?
- Not hungry.

05:31.362 --> 05:36.083
- Could I have a word with you?
- Yeah, sure. Come on.

05:44.542 --> 05:47.555
- What's up?
- Sit down.

05:47.711 --> 05:49.764
Oh, yeah?

05:55.177 --> 05:58.772
I wanted you to be the first to know.

06:02.435 --> 06:05.068
There's a man in my life.

06:10.735 --> 06:13.499
Well... that's all.

06:18.909 --> 06:22.089
- Are you in trouble?
- No.

06:22.246 --> 06:25.544
I'm not in trouble. I'm in love.

06:28.002 --> 06:30.588
I'm in love.

06:38.054 --> 06:40.734
I'm leaving the sisterhood.

06:42.850 --> 06:47.571
- Are you sure?
- I've never been more sure of anything.

06:47.730 --> 06:49.237
Ob...

06:51.108 --> 06:55.201
He isn't a Catholic or I'd
ask you to marry me... us.

06:59.950 --> 07:03.047
Would you walk me down the aisle?

07:05.164 --> 07:07.845
Would you give me away?

07:11.754 --> 07:16.428
- I'm going to miss you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

07:20.304 --> 07:22.440
Congratulations.

07:25.559 --> 07:29.486
- Feels good to have told you.
- Yeah.

07:32.817 --> 07:35.534
- Ann?
- Yeah?

07:36.821 --> 07:41.293
- God bless you.
- Thanks. I'll need it.

10:30.995 --> 10:33.794
Good morning, Sophie.

10:33.956 --> 10:37.503
- Did you see Sister Ann at mass?
- No. Why?

10:37.668 --> 10:40.847
She promised to bring me
something before school.

10:41.005 --> 10:48.183
- Do you want me to go to the school?
- I already called. They said she isn't there.

11:05.613 --> 11:07.665
Sister Ann?

11:15.915 --> 11:17.967
Sister Ann?

11:57.998 --> 12:00.051
Ann?

12:52.136 --> 12:55.268
Father? Father Koesler?

12:56.932 --> 13:01.073
- No, I can't now. Not now.
- It's about my baby.

13:03.355 --> 13:08.076
Could you baptise my baby
for me and Gregory, Father?

13:08.235 --> 13:14.202
- Father Nabors.
- I don't want Father Nabors. I want you.

13:14.366 --> 13:20.583
Father Nabors can baptise your baby as
well as I can. Call me later. We'll talk.

13:37.181 --> 13:39.233
Margaret?

13:52.655 --> 13:56.202
Father Koesler? I'm Pat Lennon.
Detroit Free Press!

13:56.367 --> 14:00.044
- I hope you don't mind.
- No.

14:00.204 --> 14:02.968
Nobody was here. I made myself at home.

14:03.124 --> 14:06.505
Margaret's just gone around the corner.

14:08.045 --> 14:10.726
- May I smoke?
- Sure.

14:12.466 --> 14:16.179
- This must be a doubly bad time for you.
- How's that?

14:16.345 --> 14:20.854
I heard about Sister Vania's
accident at the convent.

14:21.016 --> 14:25.441
- She was young for a nun, wasn't she?
- Yes.

14:25.604 --> 14:31.786
- Thank you. Do you mind if I sit?
- No, of course not. Excuse me.

14:31.944 --> 14:33.996
That's OK.

14:34.155 --> 14:39.410
Then there was Father Lord's passing
away. You knew him too, didn't you?

14:39.577 --> 14:41.333
Yes. That's right.

14:41.495 --> 14:47.344
He was one of your instructors
in seminary school... in St Louis.

14:49.545 --> 14:51.633
- How can I help you?
- Pat Lennon.

14:51.797 --> 14:53.849
I got that.

14:54.967 --> 14:59.606
Let me be blunt. We're both
in the newspaper business.

15:01.766 --> 15:04.945
You know of the rumours
surrounding Father Lord's death?

15:05.102 --> 15:08.068
- I've heard the talk.
- What sort of talk?

15:08.230 --> 15:13.320
- I thought you were getting to the point.
- I'm sorry, Father.

15:13.486 --> 15:16.914
A nurse named Nancy Baldwin
looked in on Father Lord

15:17.073 --> 15:20.169
after the Ash Wednesday
service in the chapel.

15:20.326 --> 15:23.838
She needed to talk, but didn't
want to go to the police.

15:23.996 --> 15:30.260
A lot of Catholics aren't comfortable talking
to a priest unless they're in a confessional.

15:30.419 --> 15:34.844
I'm Catholic. I'm just the opposite.
I guess I don't like guilt.

15:36.342 --> 15:42.689
Nancy told me she discovered Father Lord
and the plug was out of the wall.

15:42.848 --> 15:46.526
She thinks somebody did it to him.
She's sure of it.

15:46.685 --> 15:51.157
And when she found him already dead,
he was holding a rosary.

15:51.315 --> 15:57.579
It was not his own rosary, the one
he was buried with. Lt was a different one.

15:57.738 --> 16:03.540
I got her to give it to me
and now I don't know what to do with it.

16:03.702 --> 16:06.586
I thought you might want it.

16:26.809 --> 16:31.234
These were found by
yourself and Nancy Baldwin?

16:31.397 --> 16:33.283
- Yes.
- Good.

16:34.734 --> 16:40.084
- You were the first one to discover Sister Ann?
- Yes, I was.

16:40.239 --> 16:45.412
Did you notice at that time
that she was holding a rosary?

16:45.578 --> 16:49.208
- Yes.
- Sister Ann wasn't raped.

16:49.373 --> 16:51.758
Nothing was stolen.

16:53.627 --> 16:58.136
- No sign of a break-in.
- Maybe she left a door unlocked.

16:58.299 --> 17:02.439
- No. She wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

17:04.012 --> 17:09.268
Because of where the neighbourhood is.
It's not very safe.

17:09.435 --> 17:14.868
Could have followed her in.
But why arrange the scene in the bathtub?

17:16.525 --> 17:19.454
No sign of a break-in anywhere.

17:19.612 --> 17:23.289
Windows were locked. All
the doors were locked.

17:23.449 --> 17:26.462
- The tunnels?
- What tunnels?

17:26.618 --> 17:32.503
These tunnels connect all the buildings
at Holy Redeemer, one to another.

17:32.666 --> 17:38.135
The church, the convent, the rectory
are over a hundred years old,

17:38.297 --> 17:40.978
and these passageways are the oldest.

17:41.133 --> 17:46.271
When the other structures were built,
the grade school, junior high, high school,

17:46.430 --> 17:52.481
the power-house, auditorium, the gym,
new tunnels had to be added.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.723
- What's this used for?
- Nothing now.

18:23.884 --> 18:29.353
- Condemned. Structurally unsound.
- Lieutenant? You'd better look at this.

18:56.292 --> 18:58.760
There's the rest of it.

20:06.779 --> 20:09.876
What a time for the power to burn out.

20:26.465 --> 20:30.606
Get over here. Hey, don't
touch anything over there.

20:39.729 --> 20:41.781
Lieutenant.

20:52.158 --> 20:54.708
Hi. Where's your bar?

21:07.006 --> 21:10.055
- Hi.
- Hi. Thanks for coming down.

21:10.217 --> 21:13.681
Sorry I'm late. I was writing
Don Dailey's obituary.

21:13.846 --> 21:18.105
- What'll it be?
- Er... What are you drinking?

21:18.267 --> 21:21.364
- It's a Virgin Mary.
- That's good for me.

21:22.605 --> 21:24.859
- You knew Father Dailey?
- Well, you know...

21:25.024 --> 21:29.081
I'm editor of the Catholic for
eight years, you end up...

21:29.236 --> 21:32.119
You know the religious of this
city better than anybody.

21:32.281 --> 21:34.333
Probably.

21:34.492 --> 21:37.339
Do you see any pattern in all this?

21:38.412 --> 21:42.256
Pattern? The rosary.

21:42.416 --> 21:46.177
That's to let us know that
he's making a puzzle,

21:46.337 --> 21:50.560
like guessing a word with
some letters missing.

21:50.716 --> 21:54.857
A priest, a nun, a priest.

21:55.012 --> 22:00.066
Did they know each other?
Were they all liberals, conservatives?

22:00.226 --> 22:03.654
Pro-abortion? Did they work
on some Church council?

22:03.813 --> 22:06.577
I'd have to look in my files.

22:06.732 --> 22:10.742
- I think the guy wants to be stopped.
- Hi, guys.

22:11.821 --> 22:15.961
Hi. Ned Harris told me
I'd find you both here.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.916
He's all yours.

22:19.078 --> 22:21.213
I was just leaving.

22:22.790 --> 22:24.925
- Thanks, Father.
- And I'll...

22:25.084 --> 22:27.469
- Be in touch.
- Sure.

22:27.628 --> 22:31.175
Take good care of him. I like this guy.

22:31.340 --> 22:33.428
Me too.

22:34.510 --> 22:37.607
- Thank you. Do you want a drink?
- No.

22:39.098 --> 22:41.981
So, what did he want?

22:43.978 --> 22:47.490
- Help.
- Yeah, well, he's gonna need that.

22:48.607 --> 22:50.659
And?

22:53.279 --> 22:57.419
- And what?
- Did you give him any help?

22:57.575 --> 22:59.627
Not yet.

23:00.786 --> 23:02.708
Can you?

23:02.872 --> 23:05.422
I don't know.

23:11.922 --> 23:16.763
- Are you going?
- Why? You got something in mind?

23:17.887 --> 23:24.068
I don't have anything to do
and I don't want to do nothing alone.

23:24.226 --> 23:26.148
- So...
- Let's take a walk.

23:39.116 --> 23:43.043
- I used to want to become a nun.
- What happened?

23:43.204 --> 23:46.087
I grew up. I became a woman.

23:46.248 --> 23:51.302
Where does that leave me?
I used to want to become a priest.

23:53.756 --> 23:57.387
- I'm afraid I'm gonna lose this story.
- But you broke it.

23:57.551 --> 24:02.771
If there's another murder and the cops
don't get him, it'll go national.

24:02.932 --> 24:08.187
- So?
- They'll feel it'll have gotten too big for me.

24:08.354 --> 24:12.150
They've got other reporters
with more experience.

24:12.316 --> 24:15.780
Other reporters who are men.

24:25.538 --> 24:28.421
- Irene Jimenez.
- Yes, Father.

24:32.294 --> 24:34.134
Come on. Let's go.

24:37.591 --> 24:39.643
Sit down.

24:45.975 --> 24:50.614
- You want your baby baptised?
- Yes, Father.

24:51.689 --> 24:56.743
They got this card screwed up.
They list the baby's last name as Ruiz.

25:00.156 --> 25:02.789
It's... It's no mistake, Father.

25:05.411 --> 25:07.463
What do you mean?

25:08.914 --> 25:13.423
The father's name is Gregory Ruiz.

25:13.586 --> 25:17.726
You mean this child was
born out of wedlock?

25:17.882 --> 25:20.468
He will not marry me.

25:22.636 --> 25:26.184
This child cannot be baptised in a church.

25:26.348 --> 25:29.730
- But Father Koesler said...
- It doesn't matter.

25:29.894 --> 25:36.953
Church Law is very clear on this.
It's a mortal sin to commit fornication.

25:37.109 --> 25:41.618
Yes, Father. But what about my baby?

26:28.661 --> 26:31.758
Good evening. Our top story.

26:31.914 --> 26:37.003
The body of another nun has been found
at her home in the Grand River area.

26:37.169 --> 26:40.349
Police are not giving out details,

26:40.506 --> 26:46.023
but have confirmed the nun is the fourth
victim of the so-called Rosary Killer.

26:46.178 --> 26:50.140
The nun, a 63-year-old
woman named Jeanne Honora

26:50.307 --> 26:55.563
is believed to have been murdered
shortly after dark this evening.

26:55.730 --> 26:59.193
As you live, you die.

27:00.901 --> 27:06.157
With every breath you take,
you draw closer to death.

27:06.323 --> 27:09.752
You came to this communion
rail on Ash Wednesday.

27:09.910 --> 27:14.501
As I rubbed the ashes on your forehead,
I reminded each of you:

27:14.665 --> 27:19.803
"Remember, man, thou art dust
and to dust thou shalt return."

27:19.962 --> 27:22.181
But when?

27:22.339 --> 27:27.310
Ask our Lord present here on the altar.
He knows. Ask him.

27:27.470 --> 27:33.318
- Lord, when am I going to die?
- "Lord, when am I going to die?"

27:34.435 --> 27:39.156
"When I am sick? Will I die
under the surgeon's knife?"

27:39.315 --> 27:43.954
- Under the wheels of a train.
- "Under the wheels of a train?"

27:44.111 --> 27:48.418
"Will my charred body be
removed from a terrible fire,

27:48.574 --> 27:53.046
or my swollen body dragged from a river?"

28:02.505 --> 28:08.721
May the Lord be on your lips and in your
heart so that you may confess your sins.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.897
It's all right.

28:20.398 --> 28:22.948
Take your time.

28:29.031 --> 28:31.712
There's no hurry.

28:33.994 --> 28:36.545
I'm the one.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.591
Excuse me?

28:47.800 --> 28:50.648
I am the one.

28:51.971 --> 28:54.770
Oh, my God...

29:04.984 --> 29:07.368
Scared, Father?

29:11.949 --> 29:13.788
Yes.

29:24.879 --> 29:27.762
I got one in my pocket.

29:30.342 --> 29:32.928
- One what?
- A rosary.

29:35.514 --> 29:38.943
Why are you doing this?

29:39.101 --> 29:42.150
My daughter died three years ago.

29:44.106 --> 29:47.203
She was 16 years old.

29:47.359 --> 29:49.412
Sweet 16.

29:51.739 --> 29:54.207
- Pure.
- I'm sorry.

29:54.366 --> 30:01.176
You're sorry? Do you have any idea
what it's like to lose a daughter?

30:01.332 --> 30:05.294
- No.
- Lt was because of you.

30:08.672 --> 30:12.813
- I don't understand.
- All of you.

30:29.151 --> 30:35.202
- Will you make this a valid confession?
- Say five Hail Mary's and cut it out?

30:35.366 --> 30:38.083
- Is that it?
- No, that isn't it.

30:38.244 --> 30:42.503
- You want me to help you stop...
- I'm not finished!

30:43.749 --> 30:47.759
More of you to come. I promise you that.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.218
Please... Listen to me. Please, talk to me.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.054
Please.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.812
Killee. Killee.

31:39.555 --> 31:44.561
If some guy in confessional confesses
he put cyanide in the communion wine...

31:44.727 --> 31:48.191
- lf he what?
- He poisoned the church wine.

31:48.355 --> 31:51.784
You absolve him of sin, OK?

31:51.942 --> 31:56.866
Is there any way you can warn
the congregation not to drink the wine?

31:57.031 --> 31:59.581
Of course not.

32:02.161 --> 32:05.542
So you let those people drink it and die?

32:05.706 --> 32:11.804
- We're saving souls, ob, not lives.
- We already saved the penitent soul.

32:12.650 --> 32:18.368
If the penitent's confession is betrayed,
no one will feel safe in confession again.

32:18.803 --> 32:23.062
Break the seal of confession
and you destroy the Church.

32:23.224 --> 32:27.649
So the priest has to live
with all those lives on his conscience.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.280
It's his job.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.532
Killee...

32:35.903 --> 32:37.955
Come here.

32:44.537 --> 32:46.873
People are gonna die.

32:47.039 --> 32:51.963
Ob, I don't know what's going on with you
and I don't want to.

32:52.128 --> 32:56.553
- You'll have to learn to live with it.
- I don't think I can.

32:56.716 --> 33:01.271
Then you'll have to find some way
to accidentally spill that wine.

33:01.429 --> 33:04.561
It isn't wine, Killee.

33:04.724 --> 33:06.776
Killee?

34:27.556 --> 34:31.697
I didn't see you! Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

35:26.157 --> 35:28.209
Hello, Father.

35:29.452 --> 35:34.173
I saw your light on up here
from the street. May I come in?

35:35.875 --> 35:37.962
Please.

35:40.629 --> 35:46.846
Funny I should be driving around this particular
neighbourhood at this particular hour.

35:49.346 --> 35:54.151
- What are you working on?
- Oh, nothing.

35:55.686 --> 35:58.237
That's what I figured.

36:03.069 --> 36:07.494
- Is this a bad time?
- No. No, please...

36:07.656 --> 36:10.421
Don't go.

36:16.582 --> 36:21.221
- Yeah. Lt is a bad time.
- I know.

36:21.378 --> 36:23.431
Sorry.

36:29.845 --> 36:33.558
- I lost the story.
- I saw that.

36:35.476 --> 36:40.696
- Thanks for your help.
- I'm not God.

36:45.319 --> 36:48.913
I think I also might have lost my job.

36:53.953 --> 36:59.552
- I'm glad I happened to be driving by.
- Let's do something.

36:59.708 --> 37:04.181
- What? Like go out?
- Yeah. Let's go someplace.

37:04.338 --> 37:07.352
Yeah? Like on a date?

37:08.551 --> 37:11.730
- Yeah. Like on a date.
- Great.

37:11.887 --> 37:15.518
- Where's the nearest bar?
- Downstairs.

37:16.976 --> 37:19.277
Let's go.

37:22.231 --> 37:25.494
Come on, Father. Let's go.

37:29.071 --> 37:34.125
Good morning, Detroit. This
is JP on JR in the AM.

37:34.285 --> 37:36.337
Have a swell day.

37:43.419 --> 37:45.471
Thank you.

37:53.721 --> 37:56.271
Well...

38:01.479 --> 38:03.531
Yeah.

38:07.151 --> 38:10.248
- Go ahead.
- No, you.

38:21.332 --> 38:25.472
Time to get back to my miserable
little life, I suppose.

38:31.926 --> 38:35.023
See you, tiger.

38:50.486 --> 38:53.701
I'm the pastor here and I say no.
The Jimenez baby is a bastard.

38:55.991 --> 39:00.167
Its parents won't get married.
What am I supposed to do?

39:00.329 --> 39:03.923
I'm not sure they ought to get married.

39:04.083 --> 39:07.381
I think you're probably right.

39:07.545 --> 39:10.475
- What about the child?
- That's their responsibility.

39:10.631 --> 39:15.637
She's assumed that responsibility.
The child would be raised a good Catholic.

39:15.803 --> 39:21.153
A good Catholic? She gave up
that claim in the back seat of his car.

39:22.226 --> 39:26.616
Can't we be concerned
with peace of mind and not piece of ass?

39:26.772 --> 39:29.905
Peace of mind, piece of ass.

39:31.235 --> 39:37.119
That's a good one. Look, ob, do you
want me to read Church Law to you?

39:37.283 --> 39:42.289
I don't want you to read Church Law
to me. Church Law doesn't apply.

39:42.455 --> 39:47.924
It does apply. Lt has to apply. Everything
the Church stands for is based upon law.

39:51.505 --> 39:56.262
What about compassion? Understanding?

39:56.427 --> 39:59.725
What about forgiveness? Charity?

40:00.848 --> 40:05.772
That baby will not be baptised
in my church and that's final.

40:08.022 --> 40:11.616
- Your church?
- My church.

40:12.735 --> 40:18.786
And if you try to do this on your own
and I find out about it...

40:18.949 --> 40:21.998
you'll be in very serious trouble.

41:34.233 --> 41:37.330
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Shelley.

41:43.993 --> 41:47.090
- Do you have to go?
- Yeah.

41:50.541 --> 41:53.091
What's the matter?

41:55.129 --> 41:57.181
Nothing.

42:00.885 --> 42:02.937
Ob?

42:04.138 --> 42:09.109
How...? How do you tell a
priest that you care about him?

42:20.321 --> 42:22.373
Forget it.

44:03.049 --> 44:05.682
Father in heaven, hear us your children.

44:05.843 --> 44:10.683
We ask you for help, to show us
a healing hand and make us well.

44:10.848 --> 44:12.983
Say it, Sister.

44:14.643 --> 44:18.949
We pray also for our loved ones,
who suffer because we suffer.

44:19.106 --> 44:23.697
- Be with us and them this night...
- Amen! Believe it, Jesus.

44:23.861 --> 44:27.574
We ask you this with faith
that you will hear us. Amen.

44:27.740 --> 44:29.496
- Amen.
- Amen.

44:29.658 --> 44:32.209
Amen, amen, amen.

44:35.414 --> 44:41.180
- Was that all right, Mrs Washington?
- That was just fine, Sister.

44:41.337 --> 44:43.674
Goodnight, Mrs Washington.

44:45.883 --> 44:48.813
Goodnight, Sister Magdala.

44:51.972 --> 44:54.060
Thank you.

45:02.358 --> 45:05.905
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,

45:06.070 --> 45:10.661
blessed be the holy and undivided Trinity,
now and forever. Amen.

45:10.825 --> 45:15.499
I give you thanks, oh my God,
through Jesus Christ, your beloved son,

45:15.663 --> 45:21.050
for all you have given me throughout my
life and for preserving me this day.

45:21.210 --> 45:25.007
We ask that you care and
protect for our families...

48:01.537 --> 48:05.678
Lord... Vania...

48:05.833 --> 48:09.760
Dailey... Honora...

48:09.920 --> 48:11.972
Killeen...

48:13.215 --> 48:16.181
- Magdala.
- Oh!

50:12.626 --> 50:17.182
I remember Kathy Javison very well.
The difference.

50:17.339 --> 50:21.516
I don't know what happened
to her over that summer.

50:21.677 --> 50:26.980
She'd been a sweet girl.
Warm, affectionate. A good student.

50:27.141 --> 50:31.364
When she came back the next
fall, she was changed.

50:31.520 --> 50:35.613
She was moody, troubled. Her grades fell.

50:35.775 --> 50:40.283
Why? Do you have any idea
what caused the change?

50:41.822 --> 50:45.535
You might ask Sister Margaret
Mary of the Holy Martyrs.

50:45.701 --> 50:50.423
She was Kathy's advisor that year.
Perhaps she knows something.

50:50.581 --> 50:55.172
- She teaches here?
- No. She left after that year.

50:56.337 --> 51:02.186
She hasn't stayed in touch with anyone
after teaching here for over 20 years.

51:02.343 --> 51:05.024
It's odd.

51:05.179 --> 51:09.818
I'm sure she's still in
the sisterhood somewhere.

51:09.975 --> 51:13.487
- Sister Margaret...
- Mary.

51:13.646 --> 51:16.659
Mary. Of the Holy Martyrs?

51:16.816 --> 51:19.236
Yes.

51:22.780 --> 51:25.995
- Thank you, Sister.
- Not at all.

51:27.326 --> 51:31.751
So many teenagers get
involved in drugs and alcohol

51:31.914 --> 51:34.334
and that's how these tragedies occur.

51:34.500 --> 51:39.139
But Kathy wasn't into that.
It was something else entirely.

51:40.840 --> 51:45.181
- What tragedies are you referring to?
- Don't you know?

51:48.389 --> 51:51.438
Kathy Javison committed suicide.

52:08.409 --> 52:10.912
- Hi.
- How do you do?

52:11.078 --> 52:14.672
I'm Sister Mary Elizabeth.
How may I help you?

52:14.832 --> 52:17.929
- Are you the Prioress, Sister?
- Yes.

52:18.085 --> 52:23.305
Is there a Sister Margaret Mary
of the Holy Martyrs residing here?

52:23.466 --> 52:26.562
- Yes.
- Could I speak with her, please?

52:26.719 --> 52:30.266
- I'm afraid that will not be possible.
- Why not?

52:30.431 --> 52:32.851
No one can speak with her.

52:33.017 --> 52:39.696
When she entered this cloister
three years ago, she took a vow of silence

52:39.857 --> 52:46.370
and has not spoken a word
since then to anyone except God.

52:46.530 --> 52:50.042
A vow of silence?

52:53.954 --> 52:56.505
OK. Thank you, Sister.

55:10.508 --> 55:16.724
May the Lord be on your lips and in your
heart so you may confess your sins.

55:22.937 --> 55:25.523
I can't help you.

55:29.527 --> 55:32.492
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

55:33.572 --> 55:38.745
It's been 17 years since
my last confession.

55:41.455 --> 55:43.507
Pat?

55:44.959 --> 55:49.431
In that time I haven't been
to church deliberately.

55:49.588 --> 55:51.724
Pat?

55:51.882 --> 55:56.771
- I've turned my back on the church.
- Come on.

55:58.139 --> 56:02.778
I've slept with... live been
to bed with a lot of men.

56:05.104 --> 56:08.319
Sometimes one, sometimes more than one.

56:08.482 --> 56:11.033
I've slept with women.

56:15.448 --> 56:18.794
I'm guilty of greed, jealousy...

56:20.786 --> 56:23.669
malice, covetousness.

56:27.793 --> 56:31.934
But worst of all, live
lost my faith in God...

56:33.966 --> 56:37.063
and the goodness of mankind...

56:38.596 --> 56:41.561
the suffering of our Lord Jesus.

56:48.022 --> 56:53.539
For these sins and the sins
of my past life, I am truly sorry.

56:53.694 --> 56:58.119
- Pat...
- Yes, Father.

56:58.282 --> 57:01.212
Why are you doing this?

57:06.165 --> 57:08.751
I want to go ahead with it.

57:10.419 --> 57:15.307
It isn't like this any more.
Things have changed.

57:15.466 --> 57:18.016
It's all I know.

57:22.973 --> 57:25.025
Please.

57:30.648 --> 57:34.242
- Do you have a rosary?
- Mm-hm.

57:38.155 --> 57:40.789
Five "Our Fathers" and five "Hail Marys".

57:40.950 --> 57:43.915
- My act of contrition?
- Say it on the way home.

57:44.078 --> 57:46.795
Will you give me absolution?

57:55.923 --> 58:01.096
I absolve you in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

58:09.061 --> 58:13.202
If it'll make you feel better,
say the whole rosary.

01:02:34.493 --> 01:02:36.380
Mr Javison.

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:45.009
You have to talk to me.

01:05:17.239 --> 01:05:20.288
Is there any substance
to the penance theory

01:05:20.451 --> 01:05:22.788
of Free Press editor Nelson Kane?

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:26.584
The police will be out in force tomorrow

01:05:26.749 --> 01:05:31.388
and Detroit's priests and nuns
are being told to stay indoors.

01:05:31.545 --> 01:05:34.974
Don't go out unless absolutely necessary.

01:05:52.191 --> 01:05:55.904
Morning, Father. My name's Roy Mills.

01:05:56.070 --> 01:06:00.162
- Oh, yes. I got a phone call yesterday.
- Glad to know you.

01:06:00.324 --> 01:06:02.875
You too. I'm Father Harold Steele.

01:06:03.035 --> 01:06:06.464
- Where are you headed?
- Communion call.

01:06:06.622 --> 01:06:10.763
Father, live got orders to
stay with you like a shadow.

01:06:10.918 --> 01:06:15.593
My orders are to protect
the secrecy of confession.

01:06:15.756 --> 01:06:19.636
There's no way to get you out of earshot.

01:06:35.067 --> 01:06:36.907
Mrs Gates?

01:06:45.745 --> 01:06:47.797
Mrs Gates?

01:06:55.504 --> 01:06:57.841
Mrs Gates?

01:07:01.594 --> 01:07:04.275
Mrs Gates?

01:07:18.527 --> 01:07:20.782
Oh, shit!

01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:34.968
- Hello?
- Pat?

01:07:35.127 --> 01:07:38.010
I'm sorry. This is the answering service.

01:07:38.172 --> 01:07:42.395
- Oh.
- Would you care to leave a message?

01:07:42.551 --> 01:07:45.980
No. That's all right. I already left one.

01:07:46.138 --> 01:07:50.895
- Are you Father Koesler?
- Koesler. Yeah, that's right.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:56.493
Miss Lennon asked me to give you
a message. She's gone away.

01:07:56.649 --> 01:08:00.825
- She's gone away? Where?
- She didn't say.

01:08:00.986 --> 01:08:06.123
- When did she leave this?
- A few days ago. She moved out of town.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:11.456
We've been instructed to discontinue
service at the end of the month.

01:08:12.957 --> 01:08:15.009
Um...

01:08:16.877 --> 01:08:22.310
- Oh. OK. Thank you.
- She told us to tell you something else.

01:08:22.466 --> 01:08:24.305
Yes?

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:28.728
She told us to tell you... she loves you.

01:08:40.526 --> 01:08:43.076
Hold it a minute!

01:08:49.076 --> 01:08:53.631
- Can I see some ID?
- You see the badge, the patrol car.

01:08:53.788 --> 01:08:59.424
Yeah, but I'm not gonna let happen here
what happened downtown this morning.

01:08:59.587 --> 01:09:03.051
- Lt won't now I'm here.
- That makes me feel better.

01:09:03.215 --> 01:09:05.895
You can thank me later.

01:09:40.336 --> 01:09:42.720
All clear, Father.

01:10:32.763 --> 01:10:35.646
Sister Margaret Mary?

01:10:39.186 --> 01:10:42.235
I'm Father Koesler from Holy Redeemer.

01:10:42.398 --> 01:10:46.408
I've come to talk to you
about Kathy Javison.

01:10:47.486 --> 01:10:50.037
Do you remember her?

01:11:09.091 --> 01:11:15.059
Sister, I'm trying to determine
the cause of Kathy Javison's death.

01:11:15.222 --> 01:11:18.319
Do you know anything about that?

01:11:34.241 --> 01:11:37.836
I understand that. I
mean, I know about that.

01:11:37.995 --> 01:11:41.293
What I'm trying to find out, Sister...

01:11:42.458 --> 01:11:45.637
if you know...

01:11:45.795 --> 01:11:52.640
is why Kathy Javison hanged herself.

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:13.121
Didn't Archbishop Boyle
contact the Prioress?

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:18.453
And didn't he exempt you for this interview
from your vow of silence?

01:12:20.454 --> 01:12:23.551
Do you want me to call the Prioress in?

01:12:41.308 --> 01:12:44.192
I'm sorry. I don't understand this.

01:12:53.738 --> 01:12:57.878
I don't understand this. Please help me.

01:12:59.535 --> 01:13:02.667
With her father.

01:13:04.749 --> 01:13:08.462
- What?
- With her father.

01:13:16.177 --> 01:13:18.763
She came to me...

01:13:22.266 --> 01:13:26.027
I was the only one she would ever come to.

01:13:26.187 --> 01:13:29.948
Not right away, not for a long time.

01:13:30.107 --> 01:13:32.990
Finally, she came to me.

01:13:34.987 --> 01:13:38.084
She told me

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:44.007
her father was committing incest with her.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:50.763
She wanted to stop somehow.

01:13:55.424 --> 01:13:58.639
I called her a liar.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:05.853
I told her her father would not do
something so unspeakable.

01:14:07.937 --> 01:14:12.160
I chastised her severely...

01:14:13.234 --> 01:14:19.166
for having foul thoughts
and spreading wicked lies.

01:14:20.783 --> 01:14:23.998
She wouldn't talk to me after that...

01:14:25.162 --> 01:14:27.713
out of shame.

01:14:30.042 --> 01:14:34.551
A month later, she killed herself...

01:14:38.259 --> 01:14:41.391
and I knew she had told me the truth.

01:16:02.134 --> 01:16:08.351
Telephone repair man. We've had complaints
of lines crossed in the neighbourhood.

01:16:24.698 --> 01:16:26.751
Ready to go, Father?

01:16:26.909 --> 01:16:31.381
Sister Margaret Mary.
Take a look at my face.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.572
Freeze!

01:17:27.762 --> 01:17:30.645
Sit down, Father.

01:17:33.768 --> 01:17:39.783
Obviously we're dealing with a man
who's going after premeditated targets,

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:45.493
not just anybody with a collar or a habit
who happens to be available.

01:17:47.073 --> 01:17:51.035
So... what do you think?

01:17:54.497 --> 01:17:58.969
- I don't know what...
- I'm not stupid! You know something.

01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:02.554
- I don't think...
- I don't give a damn!

01:18:02.713 --> 01:18:06.011
You interview a woman who's
taken a vow of silence

01:18:06.175 --> 01:18:09.687
and two minutes later she turns up dead?

01:18:11.389 --> 01:18:14.272
I don't have anything to say.

01:18:14.433 --> 01:18:19.273
If you want to sit and watch
while your friends die, that's up to you,

01:18:19.438 --> 01:18:24.195
but now my men are getting killed
and they're not all Catholic

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:29.366
and they may not all understand
about your professional secrets.

01:19:04.358 --> 01:19:06.992
On your way out of here,

01:19:07.153 --> 01:19:11.293
I want you to take a good
look at our bulletin board.

01:19:12.867 --> 01:19:15.666
Then look into your soul...

01:19:17.371 --> 01:19:20.800
and then decide what it is you can tell me.

01:19:25.045 --> 01:19:27.596
It's up to you now.

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.363
Lieutenant Koznicki, please.

01:21:11.026 --> 01:21:17.623
Would you ask him to phone ob Koesler?
Yeah. He has the number.

01:21:37.595 --> 01:21:42.768
"I am the Lord your God."
Where have you been, kids?

01:21:46.896 --> 01:21:51.653
"You shall not use God's
name in vain." Sorry.

01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:57.207
In vain down the drain. In vain, yeah.

01:21:59.033 --> 01:22:03.707
Oh, my God... Thou shalt not kill.

01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:08.846
She loved you so.

01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:16.889
"Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day."

01:22:17.051 --> 01:22:19.601
What for? The collection?

01:22:23.849 --> 01:22:26.567
"You shall not kill."

01:22:27.895 --> 01:22:31.692
You kill. You let Killee be killed.

01:22:33.234 --> 01:22:38.453
Thou should not have killed Killee.
Killee should not have been killed.

01:22:50.501 --> 01:22:52.553
Killee...

01:22:54.422 --> 01:22:56.972
"You shall not steal."

01:22:58.134 --> 01:23:00.186
Steal.

01:23:02.513 --> 01:23:07.353
Father Harold Steele...

01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:13.739
Just a second. Hang on.

01:23:17.445 --> 01:23:20.410
Oh, Lord... Good Lord.

01:23:23.743 --> 01:23:27.124
"Keep holy the Sabbath day."

01:23:28.706 --> 01:23:31.589
Day... Dailey.

01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:35.553
Father Michael Dailey.

01:23:35.713 --> 01:23:41.561
"Honor your mother..."
Honor. Honora. Mother Jeanne Honora.

01:23:41.719 --> 01:23:44.400
"You shall not commit adultery."

01:23:44.555 --> 01:23:50.273
Sister Marie Magdala Conners.
Magdala... Magdalene. Mary Magdalene.

01:23:52.354 --> 01:23:54.241
Lieutenant.

01:23:58.611 --> 01:24:02.123
You think there'd be a Father Wife here.

01:24:02.281 --> 01:24:06.457
- Did you see the Archdiocese Directory?
- It's over there.

01:24:06.619 --> 01:24:11.091
Thanks. Ob, did you look up
the Greek word for "covet"?

01:24:11.248 --> 01:24:15.554
- No, I didn't.
- Would you do that for me?

01:24:15.711 --> 01:24:19.555
- Maybe a Father Spouse.
- Father, you'd better come along.

01:24:19.715 --> 01:24:23.013
- Come along where?
- To headquarters.

01:24:23.177 --> 01:24:27.483
Tomorrow's Good Friday. We
have a lot of planning to do.

01:24:30.226 --> 01:24:34.615
Good Friday. I don't see
what's so good about it.

01:24:34.772 --> 01:24:37.702
Christ died on Good Friday.

01:24:44.407 --> 01:24:47.954
Behold! The wood of the cross.

01:25:05.886 --> 01:25:10.608
- Behold! The wood of the cross.
- Amen.

01:27:22.648 --> 01:27:24.949
Ack! Ack!

01:27:51.761 --> 01:27:57.609
Cheer up, ob. He didn't get me
in the church. That was his best chance.

01:27:59.351 --> 01:28:01.902
I'm gonna be all right.

01:28:05.066 --> 01:28:08.162
You just can't give up hope.

01:28:09.987 --> 01:28:13.618
Swell company you turned out to be.

01:28:23.542 --> 01:28:25.594
OK.

01:29:34.363 --> 01:29:36.997
I'm going outside.

01:29:38.492 --> 01:29:41.790
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

01:29:51.297 --> 01:29:55.769
It's almost midnight.
This was his last Friday.

01:29:55.926 --> 01:30:02.522
It's too late for him to do anything here.
He's had to blow his whole plan.

01:30:02.683 --> 01:30:06.195
Has anything else happened
anywhere in the city?

01:30:06.353 --> 01:30:11.324
No, nothing. All is quiet.
I think we've stopped him.

01:30:14.195 --> 01:30:16.366
Anyway...

01:30:18.616 --> 01:30:24.418
We'll still be outside for a while.
If anything changes, we'll let you know.

01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:27.677
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Yeah.

01:32:35.461 --> 01:32:39.767
Poor soul lost his daughter
during the night. Such a tragedy.

01:32:39.924 --> 01:32:45.523
I know it's late, but making arrangements
can get your mind off things.

01:32:45.679 --> 01:32:49.772
You wait here and I'll
see if I have the forms.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:56.151
- It's not too late.
- Yes, it is. She's dead.

01:32:56.315 --> 01:33:00.242
- Not her soul.
- Her soul is in hell.

01:33:02.154 --> 01:33:05.748
- We're all set.
- Let me handle this, Ted.

01:33:05.908 --> 01:33:08.162
- I can handle it.
- You're tired.

01:33:08.327 --> 01:33:13.761
I'm always tired, ob.
I've been a priest for 37 years, you know.

01:33:13.916 --> 01:33:18.222
- Ted, please...
- I want Father Nabors.

01:33:20.214 --> 01:33:22.764
Step into my office here.

01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:41.032
For crying out loud, ob!

01:33:47.867 --> 01:33:50.750
I don't want you here.

01:34:19.607 --> 01:34:22.704
I had that address. What did I do with it?

01:34:27.198 --> 01:34:31.670
She would want me to be here,
want you to talk to me.

01:34:33.746 --> 01:34:36.380
You broke the seal.

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:39.423
- No, I didn't.
- You liar.

01:34:39.585 --> 01:34:44.591
Here it is. Now, what did
your daughter die of?

01:34:53.057 --> 01:34:55.774
I was fucking her.

01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:02.658
I was fucking my daughter.

01:35:02.817 --> 01:35:06.163
I was fucking her late at night,

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.377
in the darkness, in her own bed,

01:35:10.533 --> 01:35:13.297
while her mother was asleep.

01:35:13.452 --> 01:35:15.588
It was killing her.

01:35:18.332 --> 01:35:21.132
Jesus. Did you see a priest?

01:35:21.293 --> 01:35:25.304
Oh, yes. I saw a priest.

01:35:26.465 --> 01:35:31.721
Know what he told me? He
told me to cut it out.

01:35:31.887 --> 01:35:38.519
He said say five "Our Fathers"
and five "Hail Marys" and cut it out.

01:35:39.603 --> 01:35:43.744
He absolved me. He absolved me.

01:35:45.234 --> 01:35:48.449
Do you know who that priest is?

01:35:51.532 --> 01:35:53.786
I think you do.

01:35:54.869 --> 01:35:58.665
His name was Ted Nabors.

01:36:01.792 --> 01:36:04.260
Look at me, Father.

01:36:06.297 --> 01:36:08.384
Look at me.

01:36:41.582 --> 01:36:45.924
- You OK, Father?
- Watch out for the broken glass.

01:36:46.087 --> 01:36:48.139
Yeah.

01:36:49.715 --> 01:36:52.681
Let's get the photographers in here.

01:36:52.843 --> 01:36:55.311
Get him out of here.

01:37:23.249 --> 01:37:27.970
It's the guy. He's got the wound
in his leg, gun checks out.

01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:30.715
No ID, but it's him.

01:37:31.841 --> 01:37:38.058
We found this in his pocket. Looks like
he's been carrying it around for a while.

01:37:58.033 --> 01:38:03.586
I absolve you in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:39:38.718 --> 01:39:40.972
"Dear Father."

01:39:41.137 --> 01:39:47.187
"I'm sitting at your desk writing this.
Mother is downstairs somewhere."

01:39:47.351 --> 01:39:52.738
"Soon I will go back to my room
and close the door for the last time."

01:39:52.898 --> 01:39:56.326
"I just can't keep hating myself."

01:39:56.485 --> 01:40:00.198
"I wish to God I knew where I'm going."

01:40:00.364 --> 01:40:03.330
"I'm afraid."

01:40:03.492 --> 01:40:09.459
"Goodbye, Father. Please forgive
me as I now forgive you."

01:40:09.623 --> 01:40:14.380
"May the Lord bless you and
keep you forever and ever."

01:40:14.545 --> 01:40:17.095
"Love Kathy."

01:41:05.638 --> 01:41:11.155
" Is it me that I see."
