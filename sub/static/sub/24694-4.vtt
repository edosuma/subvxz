00:06.734 --> 00:09.198
In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.199 --> 00:11.067
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued

00:11.068 --> 00:14.166
by the detectives
of the major case squad.

00:14.167 --> 00:16.067
These are their stories.

00:27.968 --> 00:31.833
Ow! Let's run away.

00:31.834 --> 00:33.167
They'll bring us back.

00:33.168 --> 00:37.800
My boys.

00:37.801 --> 00:40.701
<i>Wo sind meine adlige knaben?</i>

00:48.000 --> 00:49.934
Stay here.

00:52.701 --> 00:54.367
My boys!

01:06.434 --> 01:09.132
We're meeting royals.

01:12.033 --> 01:14.333
You're not clean!

01:14.334 --> 01:18.333
<i>Ihr werdet...</i>

01:18.334 --> 01:19.867
<i>Verstrafft!</i>

01:19.868 --> 01:22.299
Try to calm down, mama.

01:47.434 --> 01:50.167
Aah!

01:59.634 --> 02:01.667
Mama!

02:11.300 --> 02:13.533
I sent regrets
to the Huntingtons.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.900
Their dinner conflicts
with your reunion next month.

02:16.901 --> 02:18.533
My reunion?

02:18.534 --> 02:21.266
I called the alumni committee
and raised hell.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.566
Believe me,
now they know how to reach you.

02:23.567 --> 02:25.900
Lukie, I'm really
not up for it.

02:25.901 --> 02:28.133
You only skip a reunion
if you're fat, single,

02:28.134 --> 02:29.500
or unemployed.

02:29.501 --> 02:31.766
There's only one decent
hotel in Princeton.

02:31.767 --> 02:33.233
We'll never get a room.

02:33.234 --> 02:34.833
I booked a suite.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.166
Hello?

02:41.167 --> 02:44.500
Yes.

02:44.501 --> 02:47.234
Yes, this is Gray Vanderhoven.

02:49.167 --> 02:51.433
When you called before,
I told you not to...

02:51.434 --> 02:54.933
- Who is it, Gray?
- I got it!

02:54.934 --> 02:57.600
Please. It means
everything to me right now.

02:57.601 --> 02:59.566
I'll come to your place.

02:59.567 --> 03:02.299
No, it's simply not possible.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.032
My...

03:04.033 --> 03:05.867
I... it doesn...

03:05.868 --> 03:09.132
all right, I'll meet you.

03:09.133 --> 03:11.999
What?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.999
The...

03:14.000 --> 03:15.633
Alarm company in Montauk.

03:15.634 --> 03:18.333
Probably another raccoon.
They'll check and call back.

03:18.334 --> 03:20.800
I'm not missing the reception
for a raccoon.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.032
Well, honey... I know.
But you go ahead.

03:23.033 --> 03:24.466
I'll handle this.

03:24.467 --> 03:25.968
So my most important
social event,

03:25.969 --> 03:27.968
and I have to go
without my husband?

03:27.969 --> 03:29.666
Lukie, it could be a break-in.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.033
Fine.

03:46.701 --> 03:48.867
Oh!

03:48.868 --> 03:51.366
Wallace, you remember
Lukie Putnum?

03:51.367 --> 03:52.834
Oh, please. Vanderhoven.

03:52.835 --> 03:54.366
Oh, sorry. I keep forgetting.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.166
Lukie's a newlywed.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.199
Not newly. Almost two years.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.166
Your husband's a Vanderhoven.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.333
- From Rheinbeck.
- New Pfalz.

04:02.334 --> 04:06.100
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

04:25.033 --> 04:26.901
I was worried
you wouldn't come.

04:26.902 --> 04:29.933
19 years.

04:29.934 --> 04:33.399
Try 20.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.666
Let's go grab a train.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.999
I'll take you to a great
place for dinner.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.032
Lukie Vanderhoven
has outdone herself once again

04:42.033 --> 04:46.099
by single-handedly raising
over $7 million.

04:51.567 --> 04:52.900
Thank you, roland.

04:52.901 --> 04:55.800
So when do I meet your wife?

04:55.801 --> 05:00.399
That's, uh...
That's problematic.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.733
But... Strangers no more,
right?

05:04.734 --> 05:07.466
What do you want, Anthony?

05:07.467 --> 05:08.967
Well, life's treated you good.

05:08.968 --> 05:10.566
I'm... I'm happy for you.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.766
Well... It's taken effort.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.933
What I need to say
takes effort too.

05:15.934 --> 05:18.266
- Do you need money?
- No, not money.

05:18.267 --> 05:19.667
No, not money.
Anthony...

05:19.668 --> 05:22.433
I'm saying it badly.

05:22.434 --> 05:26.466
But we were once so close.

05:26.467 --> 05:29.766
Remember...
She called us...

05:29.767 --> 05:33.466
Her <i>adlige knaben?</i>

05:33.467 --> 05:36.466
I still remember some German.

05:36.467 --> 05:39.567
Do you?

05:42.267 --> 05:44.167
Listen, we'll cut through here.

05:44.168 --> 05:46.200
It's shorter.

05:58.167 --> 06:01.868
I'm sorry, Anthony.
I'm never going back.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.793
== corrected by <font color="#00FF00">Martzy</font> ==
www.addic7ed.com

06:58.801 --> 07:00.298
Single shot fired face on

07:00.299 --> 07:01.467
from a small-caliber weapon.

07:01.468 --> 07:04.066
- Robbery?
- Possibly... no watch.

07:04.067 --> 07:07.933
Wallet was found on the body.
No money or credit cards.

07:07.934 --> 07:10.132
Cardboard was placed
over his face.

07:10.133 --> 07:13.766
That's a odd gesture
for a street crime.

07:13.767 --> 07:18.266
Detectives.
He has no visible exit wound.

07:18.267 --> 07:21.132
I guess the single shot
took out his pump.

07:21.133 --> 07:23.833
Small-caliber entry.
Could be a .22.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.968
Hit man's favorite.

07:28.934 --> 07:32.066
Kmart suit. White cotton socks.

07:32.067 --> 07:34.700
Work shoes.

07:34.701 --> 07:37.366
Dirt or grease under his nails.

07:37.367 --> 07:40.167
Something in his sock.

07:43.033 --> 07:46.633
Penn station locker key.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.367
Have your people
collect what's in it.

07:52.601 --> 07:55.299
We got Victor Lustig.
No photo I.D.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.132
Just a social security note.
Business cards?

07:58.133 --> 08:00.132
Thief would have taken
the photo I.D.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.700
To use the credit cards.

08:01.701 --> 08:05.500
So we got a Brooks brothers
wallet... about $300...

08:05.501 --> 08:08.667
in a kmart suit?

08:10.767 --> 08:13.333
You're not buying the
social security card as valid?

08:13.334 --> 08:16.099
The only identification
on that victim is that card

08:16.100 --> 08:18.366
and the name Victor Lustig.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.633
It happens to also be the name
of a 19th century con man

08:21.634 --> 08:24.166
who once sold the eiffel tower.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.800
Victor Lustig could also
be a mechanic from bayonne

08:26.801 --> 08:28.800
who got shot
on the lower east side.

08:28.801 --> 08:30.967
Name's not that unusual.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.734
Well, my guess is
that the killer

08:32.735 --> 08:36.566
planted this wallet and card

08:36.567 --> 08:39.600
to hide the victim's identity
'cause it connects them.

08:39.601 --> 08:41.566
And here's a name...

08:41.567 --> 08:45.032
A prescription for compazine
made out to Anthony Burris

08:45.033 --> 08:47.967
by a Dr. Desouza
from Philadelphia.

08:47.968 --> 08:49.567
Compazine...
that's an anti-nausea drug.

08:49.568 --> 08:52.566
I had to take it last summer
after a PBA clam bake.

08:52.567 --> 08:55.800
- Let's see.
- Oh, Halloween?

08:55.801 --> 08:59.466
I'd say the kids
weren't having much fun.

08:59.467 --> 09:03.733
Yeah, I don't think
it's Halloween.

09:03.734 --> 09:05.466
Let's see...

09:05.467 --> 09:07.999
So if Victor Lustig
is now Anthony Burris,

09:08.000 --> 09:09.967
who's Anthony burris?

09:09.968 --> 09:11.633
Well, Anthony Burris's mail

09:11.634 --> 09:14.433
goes to 2112 parsifal street,
Philadelphia.

09:14.434 --> 09:16.366
This is his phone bill.

09:16.367 --> 09:20.366
You can eat lunch on the acela.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.633
I rent by the week
or by the month

09:22.634 --> 09:24.666
mostly to single guys
who work nearby.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.465
How long did Mr. burris
live here?

09:26.466 --> 09:27.699
Mm, about six months.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.467
He was working part-time
as a mechanic.

09:29.468 --> 09:34.200
Do you know where?
I only know he took the bus.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.266
He owes a balance.
Cops gonna be payin' me?

09:39.267 --> 09:43.099
Uh, we'll talk
after we look around.

09:43.100 --> 09:46.634
Well, he knew how to live
on minimum wage.

09:53.501 --> 09:56.399
Guess he wore his
Sunday best when he got shot.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.500
Well, that goes along with

09:58.501 --> 10:01.166
meeting someone
he was trying to impress.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.299
Here's something that's dated
a little over a year ago.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.700
"Dear Mr. burris,
I have no information

10:06.701 --> 10:08.667
"on the person
of whom you've inquired.

10:08.668 --> 10:10.999
"Do not contact me again.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.533
Signed Mavis Rightmire."

10:13.534 --> 10:16.667
Return address
is new canaan, Connecticut.

10:20.067 --> 10:21.267
Three years ago,

10:21.268 --> 10:23.533
I was engaged to a man
named Richard Phelps.

10:23.534 --> 10:25.766
This... Anthony burris person

10:25.767 --> 10:28.399
saw a photo of us
taken at a charity event.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.233
He wrote me...
Wanting to know about Richard.

10:31.234 --> 10:32.766
He thought he knew him

10:32.767 --> 10:34.434
and wanted to reestablish
contact.

10:34.435 --> 10:37.800
And... Did Mr. Phelps
know Anthony burris?

10:37.801 --> 10:39.766
He denied it.

10:39.767 --> 10:42.233
At first, I believed him.

10:42.234 --> 10:45.800
Richard was Princeton, '95.
I was also Princeton.

10:45.801 --> 10:47.700
But when I showed him
the letter,

10:47.701 --> 10:49.933
his behavior changed.

10:49.934 --> 10:53.233
What, he... he thought
that you mistrusted him or...

10:53.234 --> 10:55.299
He made irate accusations

10:55.300 --> 10:57.533
that I was checking his past.

10:57.534 --> 10:59.267
And that actually
made me suspicious,

10:59.268 --> 11:02.433
so I hired
a former police officer

11:02.434 --> 11:06.099
who found things on
Richard's computer... Research.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.800
- Research.
- On others.

11:08.801 --> 11:11.833
Divorced or widowed...
Well-off.

11:11.834 --> 11:16.466
When I confronted Richard,
he wanted to explain everything.

11:16.467 --> 11:20.433
We had a nice dinner, and...

11:20.434 --> 11:22.933
We were very close that night.

11:22.934 --> 11:26.967
And in the morning,
he was gone.

11:26.968 --> 11:29.099
Did he have access
to your accounts?

11:29.100 --> 11:31.166
I-I don't think
he was after money.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.466
His own money was tied up,

11:33.467 --> 11:36.366
so I just lent him
a little pocket money,

11:36.367 --> 11:39.734
and I bought him
a few nice gifts.

11:42.634 --> 11:46.400
A Brooks brothers wallet?

11:48.734 --> 11:51.199
The cop she hired
was very thorough,

11:51.200 --> 11:52.800
and so was Richard Phelps.

11:52.801 --> 11:55.500
His research on these women
starts at kindergarten.

11:55.501 --> 11:58.833
Lonely women...
common mark for con men.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.833
With a twist.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.999
He didn't grab her money
before he left.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.299
I'm thinking if Burris's letter

12:05.300 --> 12:07.833
ruined his plan
with Mavis Rightmire,

12:07.834 --> 12:12.601
it's possible burris somehow
ruined a more recent plan.

12:15.133 --> 12:18.132
I live there.

12:18.133 --> 12:20.466
You're not lonely?

12:20.467 --> 12:23.166
Uh... My husband and I
lived in town,

12:23.167 --> 12:24.833
but when it ended, I...

12:24.834 --> 12:26.333
you wanted your own life back.

12:26.334 --> 12:29.166
I know the feeling.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.633
That's it. Spy hop house.

12:31.634 --> 12:34.233
Spy hop. It's a whaling term.

12:34.234 --> 12:36.666
- Very good.
- Well...

12:36.667 --> 12:38.166
This is, after all, nantucket,

12:38.167 --> 12:40.733
but I have no idea
what it means.

12:40.734 --> 12:43.666
When a whale puts his head
out of the water to look around,

12:43.667 --> 12:44.999
that's called spy hop.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.633
See how it sort of
juts up out of the marsh?

12:48.634 --> 12:51.901
- Yeah... Like a whale.
- Yeah.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.900
So where are you from,
Mr. chisholm?

13:08.901 --> 13:10.833
Ah, old family.

13:10.834 --> 13:14.066
We're spread around, uh,
new Mexico and Arizona.

13:14.067 --> 13:16.533
And not Mr. Chisholm.
Tyler.

13:16.534 --> 13:19.533
Julianna.

13:19.534 --> 13:21.900
There's a hint of the west
in your speech,

13:21.901 --> 13:23.766
but you seem very east coast.

13:23.767 --> 13:26.766
Guess Princeton
must have rubbed off.

13:26.767 --> 13:29.600
Princeton.
Me too.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.968
Ah!

13:34.100 --> 13:37.733
You do know what you're
in for on nantucket in January.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.900
Perfect writing environment.

13:39.901 --> 13:42.233
Mind me asking what you write?

13:42.234 --> 13:44.900
I've had a few books published

13:44.901 --> 13:47.099
under different names,
but, uh...

13:47.100 --> 13:50.900
The novel I'm working on now
will be in my own.

13:50.901 --> 13:53.233
I think it's very exciting

13:53.234 --> 13:57.933
that you'll
create something here.

13:57.934 --> 13:59.933
So for a winter rental,

13:59.934 --> 14:02.900
I could let you have this
for 2,000 a month.

14:02.901 --> 14:06.734
Done.
Great. I'll have it cleaned.

14:20.801 --> 14:23.132
The .22-caliber bullet
tumbled after entry,

14:23.133 --> 14:26.132
causing severe cardiac
and arterial damage.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.833
Death occurred within seconds.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.666
And this is a burn.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.166
It's old. Early childhood.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.832
The pattern looks like
a steam iron.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.767
There's a similar burn
on the other forearm.

14:35.768 --> 14:38.999
So as a child, he might have
been an abuse victim.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.633
And what about
the stomach contents?

14:41.634 --> 14:44.166
Anything tell us
where he had his last meal?

14:44.167 --> 14:46.933
Probably a vending machine.

14:46.934 --> 14:49.500
Bologna, white bread,
processed cheese.

14:49.501 --> 14:52.967
No wonder he needed
anti-nausea medication.

14:52.968 --> 14:56.800
Well, that was probably
to deal with chemotherapy.

14:56.801 --> 15:00.299
Lab tests indicate
a blood malignancy.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.500
I'm not offering a medical
expert opinion, but...

15:04.501 --> 15:08.634
What I saw didn't look good.

15:11.234 --> 15:13.800
There you go.

15:13.801 --> 15:16.333
- Cash.
- Yeah. A problem?

15:16.334 --> 15:19.533
No.
Makes you a bit mysterious.

15:21.067 --> 15:24.867
No, I'm... I'm not, uh,
I'm not mysterious at all.

15:24.868 --> 15:28.666
That's what I told my father.
He insisted on googling you.

15:28.667 --> 15:31.366
He find anything?

15:31.367 --> 15:33.067
Tyler chisholm...
Distinguished himself

15:33.068 --> 15:35.333
with a lifelong study
of wood warblers.

15:35.334 --> 15:38.733
He also taught ornithology
at Cornell.

15:38.734 --> 15:41.533
The problem is... and this is
where you're caught in a lie...

15:41.534 --> 15:43.433
you do not look 84 years old.

15:45.934 --> 15:49.233
I tell you,
finding this place, it...

15:49.234 --> 15:53.299
It almost seems like
it was meant to be.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.132
I called the doctor who wrote
the compazine prescription.

15:56.133 --> 15:59.299
He was treating burris
for lymphoma.

15:59.300 --> 16:02.433
Had he given a prognosis?
Six months, tops.

16:02.434 --> 16:05.600
I doubt the killer was aware
that burris was sick.

16:05.601 --> 16:08.533
Because he wouldn't bother
to kill a man he knew was dying.

16:08.534 --> 16:12.066
I mean, why...
Would a dying man extort money?

16:12.067 --> 16:13.566
Maybe he had a greedy family.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.399
What do we know about
his family?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.801
Uh, his medical records
had only one person listed

16:17.802 --> 16:19.233
as next of kin.

16:19.234 --> 16:22.299
Patricia Lumet, his ex-wife.

16:22.300 --> 16:25.433
She works at a supermarket
in Metro park.

16:25.434 --> 16:26.766
Poor Anthony.

16:26.767 --> 16:28.766
I mean, nothin'
ever went right for him.

16:28.767 --> 16:30.566
Nothin'.

16:30.567 --> 16:33.766
You were married three years.
Was any of it good?

16:33.767 --> 16:36.600
Yeah, at first, kinda, but...

16:36.601 --> 16:39.566
You know, Anthony
was damaged goods.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.666
What do you mean?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.432
Well, I mean,
he wasn't a bad guy.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.300
He just couldn't
hold nothin' together...

16:45.301 --> 16:46.800
jobs, night school.

16:46.801 --> 16:48.633
He just couldn't cut it.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.133
You weren't aware
of his illness?

16:50.134 --> 16:52.333
You were listed as next of kin.

16:52.334 --> 16:54.333
I guess he never had
no one else.

16:54.334 --> 16:56.299
He never really had a home,

16:56.300 --> 16:59.334
and... His mother was,
you know, a schitzo.

17:02.033 --> 17:04.333
And he was removed
from her care.

17:04.334 --> 17:06.165
No, she died.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.166
Yeah, I don't know
if she killed herself or what,

17:08.167 --> 17:10.766
but there was something weird,
and he wouldn't talk about it,

17:10.767 --> 17:15.032
so... Well, he and his
brother went into foster care.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.833
His brother?

17:19.834 --> 17:22.098
Yeah. Thomas.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.165
Anthony used to talk about
findin' him,

17:24.166 --> 17:26.733
but it never happened.

17:29.701 --> 17:31.166
I gotta go.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.233
Can't be late on break.

17:34.701 --> 17:36.267
Eames.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.733
Okay, thanks.

17:39.734 --> 17:41.733
Burris's last call

17:41.734 --> 17:44.032
was to an Upper East Side
residential phone.

17:44.033 --> 17:47.666
The name's Vanderhoven.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.833
Is he dead?
Is that why you're here?

17:49.834 --> 17:52.900
Why would you assume that?
I don't assume anything.

17:52.901 --> 17:54.834
Then what has he done?
Are there others?

17:54.835 --> 17:57.566
Is he one of those, you know...

17:57.567 --> 18:01.500
He signed an armored pre-nup
with no objections.

18:01.501 --> 18:04.032
When did he leave?
Thursday night.

18:04.033 --> 18:07.700
Why don't you tell us
about that evening?

18:07.701 --> 18:10.600
I was to be honored
at a major charity event.

18:10.601 --> 18:12.867
We had a little Mr. and Mrs.

18:12.868 --> 18:15.867
About a stupid phone call
from the alarm company.

18:15.868 --> 18:17.833
Nothing.

18:17.834 --> 18:19.500
It's so tawdry.
I came home.

18:19.501 --> 18:22.032
The place was torn up,
and he was gone.

18:22.033 --> 18:24.434
How did you meet him?
I have a house in Montauk.

18:24.435 --> 18:27.166
He called about renting it.
Did he?

18:27.167 --> 18:29.199
He didn't need to.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.266
We met. He was charming.

18:32.267 --> 18:34.234
We're both Princeton,
had things in common.

18:34.235 --> 18:36.633
Princeton.

18:36.634 --> 18:37.968
The night he left,
he was annoyed at me

18:37.969 --> 18:39.533
for signing him up
for a reunion.

18:39.534 --> 18:41.365
Maybe he didn't really
go to Princeton.

18:41.366 --> 18:43.367
Oh, he must have.
He knew all the right names.

18:43.368 --> 18:45.833
Even knew the occidental
club's secret recipe

18:45.834 --> 18:47.867
for boneless shad.

18:47.868 --> 18:50.666
You say he tore the place up.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.299
Did he take anything of value?

18:53.300 --> 18:58.399
No. He didn't find
what he was looking for.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.399
This.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.566
I was having it framed
as a surprise present for him.

19:04.567 --> 19:08.501
It seemed to be the only thing
he really valued.

19:10.634 --> 19:13.933
<i>Ex nobilis barusia.</i>

19:13.934 --> 19:15.933
Do you know what it says?

19:15.934 --> 19:18.233
I don't know Latin.

19:18.234 --> 19:20.233
But Gray said it was
a family crest.

19:20.234 --> 19:22.299
He didn't wanna brag about it.

19:22.300 --> 19:27.099
I-it documents descent
from east prussian royalty.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.500
I wouldn't know.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.868
I don't even know
who I married.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.834
Lukie Vanderhoven
married a phony pedigree.

20:08.835 --> 20:12.066
He failed to get at her money.
They both came up empty-handed.

20:12.067 --> 20:15.466
I don't think it was
the money that Gray was after.

20:15.467 --> 20:18.999
Lukie bragged he signed
an iron-clad pre-nup.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.967
Call me a skeptic.
No way he married for love.

20:21.968 --> 20:24.199
5th Avenue apartment,
full social calendar.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.867
That's money.

20:25.868 --> 20:27.400
Yeah, but it's also a lifestyle

20:27.401 --> 20:30.633
that matches a vision
that he has of himself.

20:30.634 --> 20:33.333
He left jewelry, expensive art.

20:33.334 --> 20:34.933
But he tore Lukie's place apart

20:34.934 --> 20:37.867
looking for the certification
of his family crest.

20:37.868 --> 20:40.600
So this guy's what... some kind
of penniless aristocrat?

20:40.601 --> 20:43.600
Well, this title
that he's claiming, uh,

20:43.601 --> 20:45.233
the Count of Haugwitz?

20:45.234 --> 20:48.533
It existed in east prussia,
but his mother's amish.

20:48.534 --> 20:51.600
So this noble heritage,
it's delusional.

20:51.601 --> 20:54.166
And then there's Princeton.

20:54.167 --> 20:56.266
He claims he went there,
and as far as we know,

20:56.267 --> 20:57.900
he only targets Princeton grads.

20:57.901 --> 21:00.733
Lukie swears he went there.

21:00.734 --> 21:03.633
He even knew a secret recipe
from the occidental club.

21:03.634 --> 21:06.733
Occidental club
is very prestigious,

21:06.734 --> 21:09.334
limited to select membership.

21:11.801 --> 21:14.833
It's always been rowdy,
but, uh... Ha.

21:14.834 --> 21:18.066
I thought when the courts
forced the club to let women in,

21:18.067 --> 21:20.633
it would calm things down,
but just the opposite.

21:20.634 --> 21:23.800
We're wondering
if you remember this man.

21:23.801 --> 21:25.967
Uh... Oh!

21:25.968 --> 21:27.633
Is that burris?

21:27.634 --> 21:29.233
Ha.

21:29.234 --> 21:31.999
Yeah, Tommy Burris.
Sure.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.633
He was real sharp.
Always wore a tie.

21:34.634 --> 21:37.166
Even when he was
washin' dishes. Ha.

21:37.167 --> 21:41.099
Uh... The students pay,
what, ten grand to eat here,

21:41.100 --> 21:43.366
and they still have to wash
their own plates?

21:43.367 --> 21:46.132
Oh, Tommy wasn't a member.
He... he worked here.

21:46.133 --> 21:47.998
But he was a scholarship
student, right?

21:47.999 --> 21:49.834
He wanted people to think that.

21:49.835 --> 21:53.266
And he was smart.

21:53.267 --> 21:54.733
He would bide his time

21:54.734 --> 21:57.099
while some smartass bragged

21:57.100 --> 22:00.967
how he had just aced
a philosophy exam...

22:00.968 --> 22:04.833
Then Tommy would quote that guy
Nietzsche in German.

22:04.834 --> 22:08.433
But he was lying.
Well, hey, sounded good.

22:08.434 --> 22:12.933
Called himself
an auto... Tridact.

22:12.934 --> 22:15.199
Autodidact. Self-educated.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.867
Yeah, that was him.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.867
Yeah, he... he sat in
on some classes,

22:18.868 --> 22:21.666
but he never registered.

22:21.667 --> 22:25.032
How long was he here?
Couple years.

22:25.033 --> 22:27.933
Then... One day
he just stopped showin' up.

22:27.934 --> 22:32.600
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

22:32.601 --> 22:35.500
There's a plaque here
for five students

22:35.501 --> 22:39.166
that died
in a climbing accident.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.299
"Jeff Walters, George Gifford,
Tyler Chisholm,

22:41.300 --> 22:43.667
Richard Phelps,
Gray Vanderhoven."

22:45.701 --> 22:48.600
Yes, Gray Vanderhoven
was a student here

22:48.601 --> 22:51.132
until his death in 1983.

22:51.133 --> 22:53.166
And Tommy burris, anything?

22:53.167 --> 22:55.066
Princeton hires at-risk teens

22:55.067 --> 22:56.801
as part of
our community outreach.

22:56.802 --> 22:58.199
He was an employee here.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.333
Referred by children's
protective services.

23:00.334 --> 23:03.166
According to this,
he showed real promise

23:03.167 --> 23:05.733
and was encouraged
to get a GED.

23:05.734 --> 23:07.733
But... There were problems.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.066
Behavioral problems?

23:10.067 --> 23:11.734
He threatened
a Russian history Professor

23:11.735 --> 23:14.834
who questioned some claim
of his royal lineage.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.833
Yeah... I remember.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.900
The burris boys.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.234
That's a long time ago.
You got a good memory.

23:25.235 --> 23:28.366
It's one of my first cases.
Those you never forget.

23:28.367 --> 23:31.533
Yeah, Tommy's the older one.

23:31.534 --> 23:33.900
And Anthony...

23:33.901 --> 23:37.666
So sweet.
So sad.

23:37.667 --> 23:42.399
He bounced from one
foster home to another.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.133
What they put him through
was the real crime.

23:44.134 --> 23:47.199
- The foster families?
- The cops.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.199
Making him testify
against his brother.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.066
Testify?

23:51.067 --> 23:55.200
Apparently, Anthony
saw Tommy kill their mom.

23:58.601 --> 24:00.233
Daddy, he went to Princeton.

24:00.234 --> 24:03.566
But he told you he was born
in Arizona, right?

24:03.567 --> 24:06.199
Our credit check
gave his birthplace as Wyoming.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.433
Why would he lie about
something so insignificant?

24:09.434 --> 24:11.433
I was... Born in Arizona.

24:11.434 --> 24:13.733
Sorry, I couldn't help
overhearing...

24:13.734 --> 24:15.166
the door was open.

24:15.167 --> 24:17.433
Mr. Morgan, Tyler chisholm.

24:17.434 --> 24:21.800
I worked, uh, summers on
my Uncle's ranch in Wyoming.

24:21.801 --> 24:23.800
It was my first job.

24:23.801 --> 24:26.566
Needed a social security card,
so I gave the Wyoming address.

24:26.567 --> 24:28.600
You signed for that card
under oath.

24:28.601 --> 24:32.600
Yeah. I was, uh, 17.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.766
You want coffee, Tyler?

24:34.767 --> 24:36.800
Yeah.

24:36.801 --> 24:39.333
We run credit checks
on people who rent from us.

24:39.334 --> 24:41.333
Right, and I... I came up
with no rating

24:41.334 --> 24:43.800
'cause I've never
borrowed money.

24:43.801 --> 24:45.767
In today's world,
that's quite a trick.

24:45.768 --> 24:48.833
Yeah, it's more a combination
of family tradition

24:48.834 --> 24:50.433
and, uh, personal choice.

24:50.434 --> 24:52.800
I think it's unfortunate
that being debt-free

24:52.801 --> 24:56.267
raises questions
about someone's character.

24:58.834 --> 25:00.833
Have some.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.466
Great.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.833
Have some pie with that coffee?

25:04.834 --> 25:07.933
Mm. Mm-hmm.

25:07.934 --> 25:09.933
We can waste
a whole lotta time here,

25:09.934 --> 25:11.833
but it won't do any good.

25:11.834 --> 25:14.132
We know your brother
killed your mother.

25:14.133 --> 25:16.266
No. I don't think so.

25:16.267 --> 25:18.032
Can you believe this?

25:18.033 --> 25:19.700
You know what's gonna happen?

25:19.701 --> 25:21.833
Your brother's
gonna admit what he did,

25:21.834 --> 25:24.066
then you're gonna be
in a whole lotta trouble.

25:24.067 --> 25:26.333
Why will I be in trouble?

25:26.334 --> 25:29.399
You lied.
You wanna go to jail?

25:29.400 --> 25:33.032
No. It's what you say.

25:33.033 --> 25:37.166
Your brother.
He killed her.

25:37.167 --> 25:39.867
Yeah.

25:39.868 --> 25:42.199
So you know, they keep them
in separate rooms.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.366
They play one against
the other.

25:44.367 --> 25:45.734
With the kids
trying to figure out

25:45.735 --> 25:48.633
what the guards wanna hear
so they can tell it to them.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.367
It would never
have made it through court.

25:50.368 --> 25:52.533
It didn't have to.
They were children.

25:52.534 --> 25:54.066
Now here's the other brother.

25:54.067 --> 25:55.566
Hey, we're all tired,

25:55.567 --> 25:58.700
but we can't leave here
until this is settled.

25:58.701 --> 26:01.366
You gotta be a man.

26:01.367 --> 26:04.066
We know it was
to protect your brother.

26:05.467 --> 26:09.066
Didn't you protect him
when your mother got mean?

26:09.067 --> 26:10.700
- Yeah.
- Well, I respect that.

26:10.701 --> 26:14.933
He respects that.

26:14.934 --> 26:17.533
He cried when he told us
he saw you

26:17.534 --> 26:20.533
throw the heater in the tub.

26:20.534 --> 26:23.333
He knew it was to protect him.

26:23.334 --> 26:25.233
- He saw me?
- He saw you.

26:25.234 --> 26:27.233
That's what he says.

26:27.234 --> 26:30.334
So you might as well
give it up!

26:38.100 --> 26:41.199
What's that in Tommy's hand?

26:41.200 --> 26:44.667
It's his mother's tiara.

26:46.334 --> 26:49.099
- Detective.
- Thank you.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.500
I checked out the names

26:50.501 --> 26:52.432
of those students
who died on the Mountain.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.367
Someone just ran
a general credit inquiry

26:54.368 --> 26:56.433
on the name Tyler chisholm.

26:56.434 --> 26:59.700
Looks like he's leasing
a house in nantucket.

26:59.701 --> 27:02.366
I'm so curious
about your novel.

27:02.367 --> 27:07.467
It's, uh, still sort
of unformed.

27:09.801 --> 27:12.233
Okay.

27:12.234 --> 27:17.099
Two children, a brother
and his younger sister.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.900
The mother...

27:19.901 --> 27:21.400
You sure you wanna hear this?

27:21.401 --> 27:23.233
Very much.

27:23.234 --> 27:24.600
Okay.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.900
The mother is, uh,
she's a remarkable woman.

27:27.901 --> 27:31.066
She knows the classics,
music, art.

27:31.067 --> 27:34.233
And she uses fantasies to...

27:34.234 --> 27:37.900
To help these children
escape the poverty

27:37.901 --> 27:41.500
and dire circumstances
of their lives.

27:42.968 --> 27:45.967
They dine as nobles
on spaghetti

27:45.968 --> 27:47.734
while she tells how
Catherine the great

27:47.735 --> 27:49.566
made love to her horse.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.967
Mm.

27:51.968 --> 27:54.132
So...

27:54.133 --> 27:56.433
They grow up shielded
by fantasy

27:56.434 --> 27:59.132
from the cruelty of the world?

27:59.133 --> 28:01.833
Yes.

28:01.834 --> 28:05.901
I would imagine
it makes them very close.

28:12.033 --> 28:14.466
How does it end?

28:14.467 --> 28:18.066
You like a happy ending?

28:18.067 --> 28:21.601
I can't disappoint you.

28:29.734 --> 28:31.533
Mr. Morgan?

28:31.534 --> 28:33.166
That's right.

28:33.167 --> 28:35.367
Hello. I'm detective goren.
This is detective Eames.

28:35.368 --> 28:38.199
We're from
the major case squad, NYPD.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.366
You ran a credit check
on a man named Tyler chisholm?

28:41.367 --> 28:44.066
He rented a house from us.
What's the problem?

28:44.067 --> 28:48.066
Is this the man?
What is it, dad?

28:48.067 --> 28:50.333
Who is he... Really?

28:50.334 --> 28:51.734
We can't discuss that.

28:51.735 --> 28:54.199
We need directions
to that house.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.266
What's going on?
What's Tyler done?

28:56.267 --> 28:58.067
- Stay out of this, honey.
- Dad.

28:58.068 --> 29:02.867
Julie, I'll deal with this.

29:02.868 --> 29:06.199
You obviously know him.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.968
Calling to warn him
would be a felony.

30:24.334 --> 30:25.999
Let's go, bud.
On your feet.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.266
Oh... okay, okay!

30:28.267 --> 30:30.166
- All right.
- Come on, let's go.

30:30.167 --> 30:32.466
Thomas burris.

30:32.467 --> 30:34.800
You've got the wrong guy.
That's not my name.

30:34.801 --> 30:37.700
Your fingerprints
will prove you wrong.

30:37.701 --> 30:40.968
That's all you'll prove.

30:49.067 --> 30:52.233
Yes, that's my husband.

30:52.234 --> 30:55.299
Well, his real name
is Thomas burris.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.666
Who is he?
Where's he from?

30:57.667 --> 31:00.666
Well, he was born
in hershey, Pennsylvania.

31:00.667 --> 31:03.800
It's so humiliating.

31:03.801 --> 31:05.867
I know he's a novelist.

31:05.868 --> 31:07.467
I knew creative people
at Princeton.

31:07.468 --> 31:09.666
They aren't like other people.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.133
He understood finance.

31:11.134 --> 31:14.666
At our annual dinner, I heard
him talk about market trends

31:14.667 --> 31:16.933
with Brad Burnap
of crown funds.

31:16.934 --> 31:18.600
Brad thought he was a genius.

31:18.601 --> 31:21.733
I majored in English.
I know that he's gifted.

31:21.734 --> 31:24.132
He get any money
from any of these people?

31:24.133 --> 31:28.032
Half a million from Brad.
For my pet project.

31:28.033 --> 31:30.366
Restoring the fountains
of versailles.

31:30.367 --> 31:32.633
He talked about his novel.
It was real.

31:32.634 --> 31:35.500
And... It all went
to your charity?

31:35.501 --> 31:38.566
Every penny.

31:38.567 --> 31:40.399
An indictment?

31:40.400 --> 31:42.733
That would happen
in your dreams, counselor.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.533
We have evidence... a lease
signed in another man's name.

31:45.534 --> 31:47.199
Driver's license.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.399
Yeah? So?

31:49.400 --> 31:51.700
Look hard.
You might find a misdemeanor.

31:51.701 --> 31:54.132
There's something
much bigger than that.

31:54.133 --> 31:56.299
Oh, the... the tragedy
of my brother's death.

31:56.300 --> 31:59.433
The only thing that connects me
to that is my grief.

31:59.434 --> 32:01.234
Take credit for the wallet
and phony I.D.

32:01.235 --> 32:02.700
You planted on his body.

32:02.701 --> 32:05.833
Come on, the wallet
was a Christmas present.

32:05.834 --> 32:08.633
So, Mr. D.A.,
the crime of re-gifting...

32:08.634 --> 32:10.901
What kinda time are they
giving for that these days?

32:10.902 --> 32:13.333
Witness testimony
will establish

32:13.334 --> 32:15.700
you had motive, means,

32:15.701 --> 32:18.066
and opportunity.

32:18.067 --> 32:19.533
Oh, right. Okay.

32:19.534 --> 32:21.366
The wonderful Lukie.

32:21.367 --> 32:24.399
Yeah, I-I'd be careful
putting her on the stand.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.100
She might work better for me
than for you.

32:30.167 --> 32:31.700
He's right.

32:31.701 --> 32:35.032
She'd make him sound wholesome
to avoid appearing like a fool.

32:35.033 --> 32:37.032
And Julianna's still smitten.

32:37.033 --> 32:39.700
You don't want a grand jury
hearing <i>anything</i> she might say.

32:39.701 --> 32:41.399
What's the deal, Whitney?

32:41.400 --> 32:43.667
How hard can we come down
on the identity charges?

32:43.668 --> 32:45.132
He's been very smart.

32:45.133 --> 32:47.567
Don't tell me that son
of a bitch is gonna walk.

32:47.568 --> 32:48.999
If we release him,

32:49.000 --> 32:52.266
he's gonna change his identity
and vanish.

32:52.267 --> 32:53.766
Go back to the women.

32:53.767 --> 32:56.234
Push them on anything he's done,
anything he's said,

32:56.235 --> 32:59.533
anything
potentially incriminating.

32:59.534 --> 33:02.933
He never told me anything
remotely incriminating.

33:02.934 --> 33:05.399
I believe that. He's clever.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.600
He's had practice.

33:08.601 --> 33:13.633
But when you first
are with a guy...

33:13.634 --> 33:16.266
There's usually
something he says

33:16.267 --> 33:19.900
or something he does that...

33:19.901 --> 33:22.600
Raises a flag.

33:22.601 --> 33:26.199
I-I'm just asking if...

33:26.200 --> 33:31.199
There was anything
that made you ask... Yourself,

33:31.200 --> 33:35.266
"is he okay?"

33:35.267 --> 33:38.366
Maybe something... Little

33:38.367 --> 33:41.367
that didn't seem to matter.

33:45.033 --> 33:46.634
The day after
he took the place,

33:46.635 --> 33:48.633
I saw him in the skiff.

33:48.634 --> 33:51.132
He wasn't rowing, just sitting.

33:51.133 --> 33:52.633
He, um...

33:52.634 --> 33:54.266
Dropped something in the water

33:54.267 --> 33:57.200
and sat just watching
where he dropped it.

34:01.400 --> 34:05.633
I don't know what it was.

34:05.634 --> 34:08.567
Do you know where this was?

34:19.667 --> 34:22.701
Hey...

34:25.132 --> 34:27.032
You're it, huh?

34:27.033 --> 34:29.500
Rolled out the big gun.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.666
- Yeah.
- Yeah. What is all this?

34:32.667 --> 34:37.699
Well, uh, this is your life.

34:37.701 --> 34:40.933
This was a present?

34:40.934 --> 34:44.565
Christmas.
You didn't find the card?

34:44.567 --> 34:47.233
But you didn't wanna
know the guy,

34:47.234 --> 34:48.833
so why give him a present?

34:48.833 --> 34:53.199
Listen, I had it good.
He didn't.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.465
Was that because
he punished himself

34:54.466 --> 34:55.634
for what he did to you, or...

34:55.635 --> 34:58.399
listen, he was six, okay?

34:58.400 --> 35:02.100
I blame people like you,
not him.

35:03.701 --> 35:06.333
Says here, "I couldn't
see it happening again,

35:06.334 --> 35:08.833
see her burning him"...
that's you, right?

35:08.834 --> 35:10.466
I paid that debt.

35:10.467 --> 35:12.633
You were like around
ten, right?

35:12.634 --> 35:15.566
Oh, I've...
What does it matter, huh?

35:15.567 --> 35:19.533
Well, then it was
reform schools, foster families

35:19.534 --> 35:22.032
rejecting you.

35:22.033 --> 35:24.766
Who wants a matricidal
delinquent, right?

35:24.767 --> 35:26.766
Yeah, you hear me complaining?

35:26.767 --> 35:28.633
No.

35:28.634 --> 35:31.868
But you found a solution
in your mother's illness.

35:34.734 --> 35:39.733
My mother was, uh,
she was schizophrenic.

35:39.734 --> 35:42.533
There's no solutions in that.

35:42.534 --> 35:45.733
Oh, well,
the delusions of grandeur,

35:45.734 --> 35:48.533
a florid state
in which you were...

35:48.534 --> 35:53.567
A noble... Count Haugwitz.

35:56.767 --> 36:01.233
<i>Das warst du... Nicht war?</i>

36:01.234 --> 36:05.733
<i>Das war ich, genau.</i>

36:05.734 --> 36:08.399
Ah. What, now you're...
you're my shrink?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.766
You know what I'm gonna do?

36:10.767 --> 36:12.200
I'm gonna use this session.

36:12.201 --> 36:13.566
I'll credit you...

36:13.567 --> 36:16.634
When I beat my rap on an
insanity plea.

36:23.133 --> 36:26.399
I'll just show you.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.334
I couldn't see it
happening again,

36:28.335 --> 36:32.200
see her burning him.

36:37.701 --> 36:40.099
I have these pictures
of you here

36:40.100 --> 36:44.033
as a young noble
with your mother.

36:55.267 --> 36:58.200
And that's your brother there.

37:00.200 --> 37:03.967
I guess he wasn't part of it.
Part of what?

37:03.968 --> 37:06.600
The delusion that you
and your mother shared.

37:06.601 --> 37:10.833
Which was more painful...

37:10.834 --> 37:14.067
Her death or his betrayal?

37:15.868 --> 37:20.199
Uh, I don't, uh...
I don't distinguish between...

37:20.200 --> 37:23.600
Between them.

37:23.601 --> 37:27.300
You remember killing her,
right?

37:28.634 --> 37:32.333
Water was spilling
over the sides of the tub.

37:32.334 --> 37:35.199
The hot water had run out.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.900
It was cold,
so she had the heater on.

37:37.901 --> 37:42.199
Excellent attention to detail.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.733
Now... You were barefoot?

37:45.734 --> 37:47.266
Uh... Don't remember.

37:47.267 --> 37:49.867
No, it's just that you
said that your feet were cold,

37:49.868 --> 37:51.767
so you must have been barefoot.
It's history.

37:51.768 --> 37:54.166
I mean, who cares?

37:54.167 --> 37:57.200
You should care.
It's made you who you are.

37:59.901 --> 38:02.700
There's a picture here
of the heater.

38:02.701 --> 38:05.900
Now, it's plugged in above her.

38:05.901 --> 38:10.600
So... You would have had
to walk through the water

38:10.601 --> 38:12.266
to reach the heater.

38:12.267 --> 38:14.933
What... what's this about?

38:14.934 --> 38:17.633
What... I don't... I admitted
to killing her, right?

38:17.634 --> 38:19.266
I did it.

38:19.267 --> 38:21.567
If you walked across the
water and touched the heater,

38:21.568 --> 38:22.900
you... Would be dead

38:22.901 --> 38:27.399
or gotten severely shocked.

38:27.400 --> 38:31.300
I don't think
that you touched the heater.

38:35.567 --> 38:39.967
I think that
that's your brother's lie.

38:39.968 --> 38:43.967
I think that you
thought about it....

38:43.968 --> 38:47.800
Watching your mother
in the bath for hours every day.

38:47.801 --> 38:50.767
Just... Throw the heater
in the tub.

38:54.167 --> 38:56.901
But you didn't do it.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.501
Yeah.

39:03.567 --> 39:05.999
She flew into a rage

39:06.000 --> 39:08.266
because she wanted to put
Anthony in the shower

39:08.267 --> 39:11.066
to wipe away the places
that she burned him, all right?

39:11.067 --> 39:13.566
Her arm hit the cord, and...

39:13.567 --> 39:15.800
And then you paid for it.

39:15.801 --> 39:18.800
And when he came back,
you were gonna pay for it again.

39:18.801 --> 39:21.099
No. No...

39:21.100 --> 39:23.566
Anthony was...
was a part of someone

39:23.567 --> 39:25.465
that I no longer
wanted to be, okay?

39:25.466 --> 39:26.834
That's why I avoided him.

39:26.835 --> 39:29.333
So you don't think he got
back into your life

39:29.334 --> 39:30.867
to destroy what you'd become?

39:30.868 --> 39:34.433
Listen, your little psycho
chatter babble isn't working.

39:34.434 --> 39:35.999
Anthony was a failure.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.434
He was tyranny of the weak,
but I didn't kill him!

39:45.667 --> 39:48.500
Well... So that's what
he's become,

39:48.501 --> 39:50.933
tyranny of the weak.

39:50.934 --> 39:53.999
Isn't he all you had...

39:54.000 --> 39:55.766
In the world?

39:55.767 --> 39:58.299
When the two of you
were little boys,

39:58.300 --> 40:01.999
comforting each other
from that nightmare...

40:02.000 --> 40:05.032
Of a mother?

40:05.033 --> 40:07.299
These photos of...

40:07.300 --> 40:11.299
I think you're
teaching him how to swim.

40:11.300 --> 40:14.534
I can see he trusts you.

40:19.501 --> 40:22.601
Did he still trust you
like that?

40:31.501 --> 40:34.166
You know, it wouldn't be fair
if I...

40:34.167 --> 40:38.032
if I didn't show you this.

40:38.033 --> 40:39.900
Oh, his...
His autopsy report.

40:39.901 --> 40:42.800
You should read it.

40:47.033 --> 40:49.633
He only had a...

40:49.634 --> 40:52.234
Few months at the most.

40:55.567 --> 40:58.766
I don't think
that Anthony came back

40:58.767 --> 41:00.033
to destroy your life.

41:00.034 --> 41:03.066
I think he came back
for atonement...

41:03.067 --> 41:05.467
For forgiveness...

41:11.868 --> 41:14.667
For what he'd done to you.

41:18.868 --> 41:21.833
If you look at the photos,
here, he's...

41:21.834 --> 41:24.333
Reaching out for you.

41:24.334 --> 41:28.999
He trusted you.
He loved you.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.566
I-I think that's why
he came back...

41:33.567 --> 41:36.234
To ask for that forgiveness.

41:38.901 --> 41:41.534
Oh...

41:48.767 --> 41:52.067
He loved me.

41:56.467 --> 41:59.533
And did you feel that

41:59.534 --> 42:02.534
before you...

42:12.767 --> 42:14.400
Yes.
