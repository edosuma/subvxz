00:02.066 --> 00:02.500
This program is rated G

00:04.233 --> 00:07.300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

00:26.667 --> 00:27.667
Ah!

00:33.533 --> 00:37.200
Bella, your pronunciation
is getting molto bene.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.533
Okay, so, spaghetti.

00:39.667 --> 00:40.533
Chicken parm.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.066
Extra spaghetti.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.066
Extra-

00:43.200 --> 00:44.066
Mama Tucci, this is too much.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.667
Nah, there's no such thing.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.667
Well, I'll have plenty of
leftovers for my coworkers.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.700
Good.

00:49.834 --> 00:50.834
Are you sure you don't
mind watching Amy again?

00:50.967 --> 00:52.166
No, it's my pleasure.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.700
I promise I won't be too late.

00:53.834 --> 00:55.667
Bye, pumpkin.
- Bye, Dad.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.233
Oh, my Amy.

00:58.367 --> 01:00.400
You're such a strong girl.

01:00.533 --> 01:01.467
Just like you, Mama.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.233
Ah!

01:03.367 --> 01:04.433
Uh!

01:04.567 --> 01:05.633
So we're gonna
make the primavera?

01:05.767 --> 01:06.900
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:07.033 --> 01:08.400
Let's get cooking!

01:09.533 --> 01:10.400
Grazie!

01:12.767 --> 01:15.800
Woo!

01:15.934 --> 01:17.066
Cool, Mama.

01:33.567 --> 01:34.934
Welcome, everyone.

01:35.066 --> 01:36.533
Hello. Good evening.

01:37.934 --> 01:41.633
So, for those of you who
are new here tonight,

01:41.767 --> 01:45.900
Family Dinner Fridays is
a tradition that my nonna

01:46.033 --> 01:49.633
started back in
Napali way back when.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.266
She would invite the
entire neighborhood

01:53.400 --> 01:55.100
to come and share a meal.

01:55.233 --> 01:59.133
So to continue her
legacy and honor Nonna,

01:59.266 --> 02:04.300
we welcome you to our
Friday Night Supper Club.

02:05.266 --> 02:06.800
We care about our customers.

02:06.934 --> 02:08.700
We treat you like family.

02:08.834 --> 02:11.333
So you're a part of
the Tucci family now.

02:11.467 --> 02:13.133
Whether you like it or not.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.700
So.

02:16.834 --> 02:17.967
A Nonna.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.066
- A Nonna.
- A Nonna.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.633
Amy?

02:24.767 --> 02:25.767
Amy?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.133
Earth to Amy, do you copy?

02:29.266 --> 02:30.367
Oh.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.533
I gotta take that
pasta to table nine,

02:31.667 --> 02:32.533
unless you want to
stare at it longer?

02:32.667 --> 02:34.266
No, no, it's all yours.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.533
I used to be like
that primavera.

02:40.667 --> 02:41.967
Bold.

02:42.100 --> 02:42.967
Full of life.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.100
Flavor.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.533
What happened to me, Christine?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.033
You're still all those things.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.133
You're just stuck in a
rut right now, that's all.

02:50.266 --> 02:53.133
How long do I have to toil
away as a mid-level manager

02:53.266 --> 02:55.533
before I finally get
the next opportunity?

02:55.667 --> 02:57.000
What if this is it for me?

02:57.133 --> 02:59.200
I'm still singing our
cheesy Happy Birthday songs

02:59.333 --> 03:00.934
to customers when I'm 90.

03:01.066 --> 03:02.400
Okay, well, you're
being dramatic.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.900
Things don't change
for me around here soon,

03:05.033 --> 03:06.433
I'm movin' on.

03:06.567 --> 03:09.400
You decided all that just
by staring at some pasta?

03:09.533 --> 03:11.934
Usually that just
gets me into trouble.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.967
Okay, it wasn't
just the primavera.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.367
Oh.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.433
Mama?

03:18.567 --> 03:19.700
Yeah.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.900
We've been playing
phone tag lately.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.367
Could really use her
advice right about now.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.867
Well, maybe today's
the day things change.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.333
Everyone gather round.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.934
As you know, we've been
interviewing applicants

03:34.066 --> 03:36.066
for the permanent
manager position.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.066
I know you've all been anxious
to hear who we've selected.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.033
It's my pleasure to announce

03:41.166 --> 03:42.667
that the honor goes to

03:44.166 --> 03:47.033
Benjamin Stewart from our
Upper East Side location.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.200
Let's make sure he feels welcome

03:48.333 --> 03:49.500
when he arrives this afternoon.

03:49.633 --> 03:50.533
Okay, back to work.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.433
Thank you.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.600
Hey, Nunzio, table four.

04:03.734 --> 04:05.300
Clean it, please.

04:05.433 --> 04:06.834
De facto.

04:06.967 --> 04:09.100
All right, I dare you to find
me a more perfect tiramisu.

04:09.233 --> 04:10.834
Outside of Italy, that is.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.600
Frank, uh, listen,
I know there's a lot

04:12.734 --> 04:13.800
been going on lately,

04:13.934 --> 04:15.934
but you really should
slow down a little.

04:16.066 --> 04:17.166
You really shouldn't
rush your craft,

04:17.300 --> 04:18.767
especially on a day
like today, right?

04:18.900 --> 04:19.800
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

04:19.934 --> 04:20.834
What are you doin'?

04:20.967 --> 04:21.934
What are you?

04:22.066 --> 04:23.133
I'm a server, so
I'm gonna serve.

04:23.266 --> 04:24.633
No, uh, the chef will
deliver the dessert.

04:24.767 --> 04:25.834
Frank, come on.

04:25.967 --> 04:27.300
We really can't afford
a bad review today.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.266
Okay, Kimberly may
be a tough critic,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.100
grant you that, but
there's no way she doesn't

04:31.233 --> 04:32.633
fall head over heels
in love with this.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.600
I know, it's nice,
but you know your menu

04:34.734 --> 04:36.567
has its detractors, right?

04:36.700 --> 04:37.600
Ah.

04:37.734 --> 04:39.000
They'll warm up.

04:39.133 --> 04:40.433
Just like that caramel
drizzle if you don't let go.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.000
Thank you.

04:45.133 --> 04:47.266
All right, I'm here.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.333
For dessert, tiramisu di Franco.

04:51.467 --> 04:53.867
Caramel drizzle topping,
dusted with cocoa.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.166
I, uh, I just wanted
to thank you again

05:02.300 --> 05:04.200
for making the time to
review our new menu.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.400
I've always had a lot of
respect and admiration

05:06.533 --> 05:08.200
for your column in The Times.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.734
Hmm.

05:09.867 --> 05:11.900
I'm sorry, was that a hmm?

05:12.033 --> 05:13.000
Or a mmm?

05:14.700 --> 05:16.000
It's nothing.

05:16.133 --> 05:18.834
No, but if it was
somethin', you could tell me.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.033
Mr. Rossi, I'm not
really supposed to give

05:22.166 --> 05:24.000
feedback before my
review goes live,

05:24.133 --> 05:26.600
but it's a little dry.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.734
I'm sorry.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.333
Did you just cause my
famously moist tiramisu

05:34.467 --> 05:36.834
a little, uh, dry?

05:36.967 --> 05:38.066
Just a touch.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.166
But that's impossible.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.667
Well, it's certainly possible.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.400
I'm sorry, it's just
never has there been a more

05:42.533 --> 05:44.900
perfect customer fit for
a more perfect dessert.

05:45.033 --> 05:47.000
I'm just, have another bite.

05:47.133 --> 05:48.667
I think I've sampled enough.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.333
You'll find my review
online later this evening.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.266
And it'll be a
good one, right?

05:57.633 --> 06:00.300
Uh, did I mention
how much I appreciate

06:00.433 --> 06:02.233
and admire you and your column?

06:02.367 --> 06:03.567
And she's gone.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.734
Ah, don't worry about it.

06:08.867 --> 06:09.934
Really?

06:10.066 --> 06:12.734
I mean worry
about it a little.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.567
Amy, I'd like you to take
Benjamin under your wing,

06:15.700 --> 06:16.900
help him get acclimated.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.433
As the most senior manager here,

06:18.567 --> 06:20.767
I want him in the
most capable hands.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.400
Well, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

06:23.533 --> 06:25.767
I thought my seniority
would've given me

06:25.900 --> 06:27.633
a leg up on that opportunity.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.533
We'll see what
opens up next year.

06:31.934 --> 06:35.633
I made myself a
promise that if I didn't

06:35.767 --> 06:38.467
move up this year,
I would move on,

06:38.600 --> 06:41.033
and I need to keep that promise.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.166
I understand.

06:43.633 --> 06:49.333
You're always welcome back
if you change your mind.

06:49.467 --> 06:50.567
Yup.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.633
Mmm-hmm, I feel liberated.

06:51.767 --> 06:52.633
Yes!

06:52.767 --> 06:53.800
I feel free!

06:53.934 --> 06:57.066
- 'Atta girl!
- I feel so scared.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.633
Oh, you were on such a roll.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.867
I don't have
anything lined up.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.633
But this is what
you've been saving for.

07:02.767 --> 07:06.333
Now you can devote all your
time to unlocking your destiny.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.800
Destiny.

07:07.934 --> 07:08.800
All right.

07:08.934 --> 07:10.300
Yeah, there's some confidence.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.133
Is that destiny calling already?

07:14.934 --> 07:15.800
Hello?

07:15.934 --> 07:17.533
Amy Lamay?

07:17.667 --> 07:18.967
David Lewis, attorney.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.533
I know you've been trying
to reach Ms. Tucci.

07:22.667 --> 07:25.834
I'm sorry to inform you that
she recently passed away

07:25.967 --> 07:27.834
and we need you to
come into our offices

07:27.967 --> 07:30.000
for the reading of her will.

07:30.133 --> 07:31.000
How's Friday?

07:31.133 --> 07:33.000
Yeah. Okay.

07:33.133 --> 07:34.533
Friday, I'll be there.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.867
Is everything all right?

07:49.400 --> 07:50.400
Hey, so.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.467
Stop refreshing.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.467
Huh?

07:53.600 --> 07:54.467
I'm not refreshing.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.467
I'm playing solitaire.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.700
Why am I lying to you?

07:56.834 --> 07:57.867
It should be up by now!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.200
So you know, her
rating has nothing to do

08:00.333 --> 08:01.367
with all your hard work.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.367
You're right.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.600
I'm, ah, eh, I'm letting go.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.667
- Let it go!
- I'm keeping cool.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.767
It doesn't even.

08:05.900 --> 08:06.767
Whoa, it's up, it's up!

08:06.900 --> 08:07.800
- It's up.
- It's up.

08:07.934 --> 08:09.100
Hey, what does it say?

08:09.233 --> 08:11.266
Chef Frank Rossi largely
abandons the restaurant's

08:11.400 --> 08:16.367
original menu in favor of
some new age Italian fusion.

08:17.233 --> 08:18.367
Nice.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.600
That just isn't
quite there yet.

08:21.734 --> 08:22.600
Mmm-mmm.

08:22.734 --> 08:24.266
What's the missing ingredient?

08:24.400 --> 08:27.233
Could be as simple
as a bit more love.

08:27.367 --> 08:28.233
Five forks.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.934
Oh, that's good.

08:30.066 --> 08:31.033
Out of 10 forks.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.266
How do you erase
something from the internet?

08:33.400 --> 08:34.533
What?

08:34.667 --> 08:36.367
No, that'll be in
print later this week.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.100
What effect is it
gonna have on business?

08:38.233 --> 08:39.533
Well, uh, you
know, our client base

08:39.667 --> 08:41.433
is kind of doing
this a little bit,

08:41.567 --> 08:44.533
and Kimberly's articles tend
to make things go like this

08:47.200 --> 08:48.900
or like that.

08:49.033 --> 08:50.033
- Okay.
- Yeah.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.433
Okay, no, it's okay.

08:51.567 --> 08:54.266
I can edit the recipes
for a little more flavor.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.533
Or less.

08:55.667 --> 08:56.600
Or a little more love.

08:56.734 --> 08:58.433
What does that even mean, Sal?

08:58.567 --> 08:59.934
I-I-I, you know.

09:00.133 --> 09:02.166
Maybe she's referring
to your demeanor,

09:02.300 --> 09:04.433
'cause sometimes you can
come across a little brash.

09:04.567 --> 09:05.433
Brash?

09:05.567 --> 09:07.600
Bra, uh, it's passion, Sal.

09:07.734 --> 09:08.600
Okay, I'm Italian.

09:08.734 --> 09:09.633
I can't help it. You know this.

09:09.767 --> 09:10.667
Yeah, I do.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.934
Oh, well, maybe this is her

09:12.066 --> 09:12.934
calling to change her mind.

09:13.066 --> 09:13.934
Hello?

09:14.066 --> 09:15.000
Is this Frank Rossi?

09:15.133 --> 09:16.300
Yeah, this is Frank Rossi.

09:16.433 --> 09:17.834
Maria Tucci
passed away recently.

09:17.967 --> 09:18.834
What?

09:18.967 --> 09:19.834
I'm sorry
for your loss.

09:19.967 --> 09:21.000
Wait. What?

09:21.133 --> 09:22.467
I'm her
attorney David Lewis.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.333
We need you to come in
for a reading of her will.

09:24.467 --> 09:25.333
Yeah.

09:25.467 --> 09:26.400
Can you
come in this Friday?

09:26.533 --> 09:27.400
Okay, Friday.

09:27.533 --> 09:28.400
We'll send
you the details.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.500
Thank you.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.500
What is it?

09:32.633 --> 09:33.834
You all right?

09:33.967 --> 09:35.467
I need some air.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.767
Okay.

09:36.900 --> 09:37.867
You okay?

09:40.033 --> 09:40.934
Good morning.

09:41.066 --> 09:42.467
Good morning.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.500
Ah, cappuccino with an extra
splash of espresso, please.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.333
Yeah, you got it.

09:46.467 --> 09:48.100
Uh, and a cannoli.

09:48.233 --> 09:49.900
Oh, lucky you.
It's our last one.

09:50.734 --> 09:51.600
I'll take a paper, too.

09:51.734 --> 09:52.700
Sure, thanks.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.166
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.767
Can I get a cappuccino
with an extra splash

09:59.900 --> 10:00.834
of espresso, please?

10:00.967 --> 10:02.166
Oh, and a cannoli.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.934
Unfortunately, we just
gave out our last one.

10:05.066 --> 10:06.100
Ah, okay.

10:06.233 --> 10:07.800
Just the cappuccino
then, please.

10:07.934 --> 10:08.934
Yeah.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.133
Couldn't help but
overhear we ordered

10:16.266 --> 10:17.667
the exact same drink.

10:17.800 --> 10:18.767
Ah, yeah.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.100
Good friend of mine
introduced it to me.

10:21.233 --> 10:23.000
This place, too, actually.

10:23.133 --> 10:24.100
Same here.

10:35.066 --> 10:36.934
Chef Frank.

10:37.066 --> 10:37.934
Or Frank.

10:38.066 --> 10:39.433
I don't know why I said that.

10:39.567 --> 10:41.867
I guess I'm just used to
introducing myself that way.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.133
Amy.

10:44.266 --> 10:45.500
What kind of chef are you?

10:45.633 --> 10:47.600
Oh, uh, Italian.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.100
Kind of renowned, actually.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.600
Renowned, wow.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.800
Ah, just a little.

10:51.934 --> 10:54.166
You know, gotta
stay humble, right?

10:54.300 --> 10:56.767
What line of work
are you in, Amy?

10:56.900 --> 10:57.767
Management.

10:57.900 --> 10:58.767
Oh.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.367
Lack thereof at the moment.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.200
I'm still trying to figure
out my destino right now.

11:03.333 --> 11:04.400
Ah, I see.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.400
Yeah.

11:05.533 --> 11:07.834
Destino.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.500
Cannoli.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.033
Uh, you're the, you're
the lucky one who got

11:16.166 --> 11:17.367
the last cannoli.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.600
Yeah.

11:18.734 --> 11:20.567
But lucky isn't how I
describe myself lately.

11:20.700 --> 11:21.667
Wanna split it?

11:22.700 --> 11:24.200
I, uh, I already had half.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.200
Right, yeah, of course.

11:25.333 --> 11:26.333
Why would...

11:28.333 --> 11:30.166
Uh, mind if I just take
a look at the paper?

11:30.300 --> 11:32.233
Gotta check the scores.

11:32.367 --> 11:33.233
Which team?

11:33.367 --> 11:34.233
Yankees.

11:34.367 --> 11:35.233
Who else?

11:35.367 --> 11:36.367
It's not baseball season.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.266
That was a joke, Amy.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.033
Not one of my best.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.033
You know what?

11:42.166 --> 11:43.233
I've gotta get going, actually,

11:43.367 --> 11:47.166
so the paper and
cannoli are all yours,

11:47.300 --> 11:48.867
renowned chef Frank.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.300
You have a nice day.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.567
Well, nice to meet you.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.533
And she's gone.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.767
So who are we waiting for?

12:01.900 --> 12:03.467
Just one more person.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.400
Sorry I'm late.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.467
Uh, weird chef guy?

12:12.600 --> 12:13.700
Last cannoli girl?

12:14.867 --> 12:16.934
What, you think I'm weird?

12:17.066 --> 12:18.233
How did you know Mama?

12:18.367 --> 12:19.734
I'm head chef
at her restaurant.

12:19.867 --> 12:21.633
I've been practically runnin'
the place the last year.

12:21.767 --> 12:23.233
Wait, how do you know her?

12:23.367 --> 12:24.800
We were close.

12:24.934 --> 12:27.233
We hadn't spoken for awhile.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.367
So you two know each other?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.233
- No.
- Yes!

12:31.367 --> 12:32.467
Yeah!

12:32.600 --> 12:33.467
We just met.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.967
Yeah.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.567
Mama wanted you both present
to hear the instructions

12:37.700 --> 12:39.400
laid out in her will.

12:39.533 --> 12:42.400
Amy, I have the utmost
confidence that you will

12:42.533 --> 12:46.433
dutifully and faithfully
preside over my life's work.

12:46.567 --> 12:48.400
You were like a
granddaughter to me.

12:48.533 --> 12:52.633
So, that's why I'm
leaving you my restaurant.

12:52.767 --> 12:55.233
Mama's is now yours.

12:55.367 --> 12:56.767
What?

12:56.900 --> 12:58.800
Mama's wish is for Frank
to remain at the restaurant

12:58.934 --> 13:02.200
in his current
capacity as head chef.

13:02.333 --> 13:05.200
There is also a
substantial inheritance,

13:05.333 --> 13:08.333
predicated on Amy
taking ownership.

13:08.467 --> 13:09.333
Oh.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.166
And

13:11.300 --> 13:14.400
she also left this.

13:17.767 --> 13:18.834
That book.

13:18.967 --> 13:19.834
She never let anyone
else touch this.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.200
Wait, wait, that's it?

13:21.333 --> 13:22.300
No other details?

13:22.433 --> 13:24.500
She's left nothing else.

13:24.633 --> 13:27.633
I'm afraid her intentions are
up to your interpretation.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.300
Good morning.

13:40.433 --> 13:41.867
Good morning.

13:42.000 --> 13:42.900
Boss.

13:44.066 --> 13:45.000
Boss.

13:45.133 --> 13:46.233
Wow.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.033
You know, I had my own
plans for Mama's where

13:48.166 --> 13:49.467
I'd one day take over,

13:49.600 --> 13:51.967
but I suppose that
just wasn't my destino.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.867
Speaking of which,
is that for me?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.500
Extra splash of
espresso and a cannoli.

13:58.633 --> 13:59.633
Tryin' to butter me up?

13:59.767 --> 14:00.967
It's a peace offering.

14:01.867 --> 14:03.867
Mama was special to both of us,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.433
and she had no other family.

14:05.567 --> 14:07.033
We can make this work.

14:15.734 --> 14:18.367
Enjoy, ladies.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.367
Hey.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.633
Ugh, no more fresh gnocci.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.200
No more gnocci.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.867
Amy, I'm slammed in the kitchen.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.367
I can't believe how busy we are.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.700
I need you to help me.

14:31.834 --> 14:32.700
What? No.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.367
Oh, no, I, I'm just the busser.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.233
No, no, there's no just
anything here at Mama's.

14:37.367 --> 14:40.900
Every role is vital to this
restaurant, you know that.

14:41.033 --> 14:42.633
What's the number one rule?

14:43.867 --> 14:45.100
Work at everything you
do with all your heart,

14:45.233 --> 14:46.367
soul, mind and strength.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.600
Perfect.

14:47.734 --> 14:49.567
You'll learn the rest
of the rules by my side.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.700
Right now you're promoted.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.233
Congratulations.

14:53.367 --> 14:54.266
Okay.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.333
There's your first customer.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.066
Smile.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.233
Benvenuti.

14:59.367 --> 15:00.767
Welcome to Mama's.

15:08.734 --> 15:10.834
What did you do to Mama's?

15:13.633 --> 15:14.767
Sales have dipped.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.266
Tiny dip.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.800
Itty bitty, in technical terms.

15:17.934 --> 15:20.500
No plans, repairs or updates.

15:20.633 --> 15:21.500
I got those plans.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.767
Just right up here.

15:23.900 --> 15:24.834
The menu's completely changed.

15:24.967 --> 15:25.967
Where are Mama's dishes?

15:26.100 --> 15:27.600
We're still working
out the kinks.

15:27.734 --> 15:29.166
We just need new, uh-

15:29.300 --> 15:30.600
Everything?

15:30.734 --> 15:33.266
Okay, we're in the
middle of an upgrade, okay?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.133
Look, things have
been kind of crazy

15:35.266 --> 15:37.633
ever since Mama slowed
down and stepped back

15:37.767 --> 15:39.266
from her duties last year.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.800
Obviously I'm not much
of an interior decorator,

15:41.934 --> 15:44.100
but I do make a mean tiramisu.

15:44.233 --> 15:46.934
All right, I come from
a big corporate franchise,

15:47.066 --> 15:48.500
and I've developed a
system that will help

15:48.633 --> 15:49.767
fix all of these issues.

15:49.900 --> 15:53.166
And then once Mama's is
back in decent shape,

15:53.300 --> 15:54.500
we can both move on.

15:54.633 --> 15:55.667
Oh, wait.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.367
So you're not
planning on staying?

16:00.834 --> 16:04.834
Financials, attendance,
scheduling, trust.

16:04.967 --> 16:06.500
The FAST system.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.500
Yeah, I got my own system.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.834
It's called DIY.

16:08.967 --> 16:09.834
Mmm.

16:09.967 --> 16:12.734
DIY hasn't been W-O-R-K-ing.

16:12.867 --> 16:14.233
Yes, acronym
thing's real cute.

16:14.367 --> 16:15.667
Definitely won't
get on my nerves.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.567
What is that?

16:17.700 --> 16:19.734
Oh, that is Galaxy Blast.

16:19.867 --> 16:22.667
Just the greatest
arcade game of all time.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.900
Wanna play?

16:24.033 --> 16:25.567
Mama's classic
Italian restaurant

16:25.700 --> 16:28.033
now features Galaxy Blast?

16:28.166 --> 16:29.400
Yeah.

16:29.533 --> 16:31.133
Okay, I'm shutting this down.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.834
What?

16:33.967 --> 16:36.066
Mama's needs a total refresh.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.734
But you know, with the
inheritance she left,

16:38.867 --> 16:41.433
I think we can really bring
this place back to life.

16:42.967 --> 16:45.367
You're the boss.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.734
What should we do with this?

16:46.867 --> 16:49.166
I'm not sure if she left
it for you or for me.

16:51.633 --> 16:52.500
You know what?

16:52.633 --> 16:53.633
Uh.

16:54.867 --> 16:57.066
It's all yours.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.533
Ooh, biscotti.

17:07.667 --> 17:08.934
Mmm-hmm.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.433
I figured some Italian
desserts would be a good way

17:10.567 --> 17:11.867
to break the ice
with the employees

17:12.000 --> 17:13.533
of your Italian restaurant.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.767
My restaurant.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.567
Nothing daunting
about those words.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.066
It's kind of funny,
though, isn't it?

17:20.200 --> 17:21.600
You just quit your job at Chow,

17:21.734 --> 17:24.200
and then this opportunity
falls right into your lap.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.400
Destino.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.266
Oh, I don't know
about destino.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.200
Why, what do you mean?

17:29.333 --> 17:31.033
I know I should
do what Mama wants.

17:31.166 --> 17:33.233
It's just that I don't know
that I can do her legacy

17:33.367 --> 17:35.367
justice if I stay
long-term, you know?

17:35.500 --> 17:38.600
She-she put her heart
and soul into that place,

17:38.734 --> 17:43.700
and if I fail at this, then
I, you know, I fail her.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.200
Hey, you won't fail her.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.200
You've never failed
her before, right?

17:50.734 --> 17:52.767
Right.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.066
So, Frankie,
how you feelin'?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.867
I think I'm still in
the anger stage of grief.

17:59.000 --> 17:59.867
Miss her.

18:00.066 --> 18:01.166
Yeah, me too.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.000
It's a lot to take
in all at once.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.433
But you know, we're
gonna get through this.

18:04.567 --> 18:05.433
I know.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.767
You know what's funny?
- What?

18:07.900 --> 18:09.800
I ran into Amy at
Destino's before we went

18:09.934 --> 18:10.834
to the lawyer.

18:10.967 --> 18:12.100
Uh-huh.

18:12.233 --> 18:13.133
Think she was
flirting with me.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.600
Really?

18:14.734 --> 18:16.000
That's a good thing you
didn't flirt back with her.

18:16.133 --> 18:19.000
That would make things a
little interesting around here.

18:19.133 --> 18:20.667
Yeah, it's...

18:20.800 --> 18:21.667
Oh no.

18:21.800 --> 18:22.767
You flirted with her, didn't ya?

18:22.900 --> 18:23.967
I don't think she noticed.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.333
I'm about as smooth
as a pine cone.

18:25.467 --> 18:26.934
Plus, we got the stresses
of this situation

18:27.066 --> 18:27.934
distracting us.

18:28.066 --> 18:28.934
Yeah, about that.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.166
What's your plan?

18:30.300 --> 18:31.467
Well, Mama made
one thing clear.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.266
She wants me to stay.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.433
Truth is, I don't know if I can.

18:40.767 --> 18:42.767
Hi, everybody. I'm Amy.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.266
I'm the new owner and manager,

18:44.400 --> 18:46.934
and I've brought you biscotti.

18:47.066 --> 18:48.600
My best friend
Christine made them.

18:48.734 --> 18:49.934
Dig in.

18:50.066 --> 18:52.166
I'm sure they'll go
well with the coffee.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.266
Uh, yeah, let's do it after.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.367
That's fine.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.533
So.

19:01.667 --> 19:04.066
Why don't you tell
me about yourselves?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.633
Okay, I'll kick things off.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.166
Well, I'm Frank.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.200
Head chef.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.533
And the menu is my duty.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.300
And my duty only.

19:14.467 --> 19:15.867
Hey, I'm Sal.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.667
I've been here for a couple
years helpin' out, you know.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.500
Hostin', servin',
cookin', all that stuff.

19:20.633 --> 19:21.500
Welcome, Amy.

19:21.633 --> 19:22.500
Thank you.

19:22.633 --> 19:23.700
Uh, yeah. Name's Lorenzo.

19:23.834 --> 19:26.867
I'm an old, old
friend of Frank's.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.233
He actually brought
me in here once things

19:28.367 --> 19:29.834
started falling apart and-

19:29.967 --> 19:31.367
Eh.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.533
Just to handle odds and ends.

19:34.667 --> 19:35.533
I'm very handy.

19:35.667 --> 19:36.900
Great.

19:37.033 --> 19:38.367
Listen, everyone.

19:38.500 --> 19:42.200
I know this is a tough
transition for all of us.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.734
We all loved Mama, so, so
let's just try to do this

19:45.867 --> 19:47.567
to honor her memory.

19:47.700 --> 19:51.233
On that note, I
took the liberty.

19:51.367 --> 19:52.500
Can you pass these out?

19:52.633 --> 19:55.233
I've assigned various
tasks to each of you

19:55.367 --> 19:58.900
based on your names.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.166
Fun, right?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.700
Yeah, that's
one way to put it.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.900
Mama's inheritance will
cover a one-month refresh,

20:05.033 --> 20:06.900
and during that time
we'll experiment

20:07.033 --> 20:08.433
with a soft open,

20:08.567 --> 20:12.867
and we will culminate in a
grand reopening celebration.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
It's gonna be big.

20:15.133 --> 20:16.834
Go team!

20:16.967 --> 20:18.567
- All right.
- Okay.

20:18.700 --> 20:21.166
And don't forget the biscotti.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.867
It's really good.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.066
Nice to meet you.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.066
Biscotti?

20:25.200 --> 20:26.166
I'm good.

20:32.367 --> 20:33.500
Don't worry about them.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.233
They'll come around.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.700
Your ragu was Papa's favorite.

20:55.834 --> 20:59.834
He always said the
key to the perfect sauce

20:59.967 --> 21:04.533
is to go easy on the seasoning
and heavy on the confidence.

21:06.367 --> 21:09.400
Roberto, come try my ragu.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.800
Perfecto.

21:16.934 --> 21:21.400
And now try

21:24.533 --> 21:26.567
And now try this.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.266
I'm still full from taste
testing your carbonara

21:29.400 --> 21:30.266
an hour ago.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.467
What's the worry?

21:31.600 --> 21:32.800
This is a lot of pressure.

21:32.934 --> 21:34.900
The First Generation
Food Festival is known

21:35.033 --> 21:36.133
to launch careers.

21:36.266 --> 21:38.233
Emilio entered last
year and now look.

21:38.367 --> 21:39.967
Emilio's on Broadway.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.300
You have faith in
your cooking, yeah?

21:42.433 --> 21:43.567
Of course.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.800
Then it will all
work out as it should.

21:45.934 --> 21:47.400
Destino.

21:47.533 --> 21:50.133
Whether it's today
or years from now,

21:50.266 --> 21:52.066
you will open your
dream restaurant.

21:53.233 --> 21:54.633
Now why are you rushing around?

21:54.767 --> 21:56.066
We've got plenty of time.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.066
Come with me.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.200
I have a surprise for you.

22:05.934 --> 22:07.633
This festival is important,

22:07.767 --> 22:10.433
but not more important than
making time for family.

22:12.433 --> 22:14.133
Masseto.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.633
But we can't afford-

22:15.767 --> 22:18.133
I sold a few lasagnas
in Brooklyn last weekend.

22:18.266 --> 22:20.033
I really like it there.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.433
Tell me, what are you seeing?

22:26.934 --> 22:28.967
The Manhattan skyline.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.533
Mmm.

22:30.667 --> 22:33.233
The view from a
quaint, brick building.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.867
My restaurant.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.200
Mama's.

22:43.767 --> 22:49.700
One day I will
give you that view.

22:49.834 --> 22:50.867
To Mama's.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.166
To Mama's.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.633
Frank.

22:55.767 --> 22:57.633
Look, look at this.

22:57.767 --> 23:00.367
Papa's sacrifices are
ultimately what led

23:00.500 --> 23:03.867
to the success of my
famous ragu sauce.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.700
Each recipe has a memory,

23:05.834 --> 23:08.433
and there's photos and stories.

23:08.567 --> 23:11.066
And nothing super helpful
for our immediate situation?

23:11.200 --> 23:12.266
Well, not necessarily.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.700
What if the key to
refreshing this place

23:14.834 --> 23:17.700
is to go back to the
beginning and replicate

23:17.834 --> 23:19.934
the original look
and feel of Mama's?

23:20.066 --> 23:21.033
Okay.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.033
Listen, I know it must feel
like I'm just coming in here

23:25.166 --> 23:26.433
to change everything.

23:26.567 --> 23:28.266
Remember, this is for Mama.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.266
Think of it as a reboot.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.433
Everybody loves a reboot.

23:30.567 --> 23:31.700
Do they?

23:31.834 --> 23:32.700
Mmm.

23:32.834 --> 23:34.033
I'm gonna need
you to trust me.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.200
Does
that go both ways?

23:36.333 --> 23:37.200
Of course.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.900
So you trust me with the menu?

23:39.033 --> 23:40.100
Uh.

23:40.233 --> 23:41.367
You have nothing
to worry about.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.567
Why does
that worry me more?

23:42.700 --> 23:44.433
Okay, let me catch
you up with the evolved

23:44.567 --> 23:45.700
flavor of Mama's, huh?

23:45.834 --> 23:47.066
Can I get rid of
the pinball machine?

23:47.200 --> 23:48.533
Absolutely not, no.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.100
I will think about it.

23:51.233 --> 23:55.200
Well, then, I will
give you a chance.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.233
Catch me up on the
evolved flavor of Mama's.

23:57.367 --> 23:58.533
All right, okay.

24:04.967 --> 24:06.333
Hey, sorry I'm late.

24:06.467 --> 24:08.100
We still have time
to catch that movie.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.500
How was day one?

24:09.633 --> 24:12.800
When I quit my job for
more of the challenge,

24:12.934 --> 24:15.266
I think I wanted something
a little less challenging.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.433
Is this about Frank?

24:17.800 --> 24:19.834
Yeah.

24:19.967 --> 24:21.767
But also about Mama.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.000
Mmm.

24:23.133 --> 24:24.500
You know how I said
I never failed her?

24:24.633 --> 24:25.600
Yeah.

24:25.734 --> 24:28.767
Well, we had a big falling out

24:28.900 --> 24:30.100
after I left all
those years ago,

24:30.233 --> 24:32.934
and we hadn't spoken since.

24:36.066 --> 24:38.934
So why would she leave
me her restaurant?

24:50.266 --> 24:51.467
Looking good, Emily.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.700
This place is sparkling clean.

24:53.834 --> 24:55.000
Maybe a bit too sparkling.

24:55.133 --> 24:56.500
Go easy on yourself.

24:56.633 --> 24:57.533
How's it goin' up here, Lorenzo?

24:57.667 --> 24:58.800
Doin' fine.

24:58.934 --> 25:01.567
Amy, these chandeliers
are a little dim.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.233
Are you sure that's what
Mama's used to look like?

25:03.367 --> 25:04.367
Yeah.

25:05.467 --> 25:06.367
No.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.367
Maybe a touch dimmer.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.400
Dimmer?

25:08.533 --> 25:10.400
Oh, perfect.

25:10.533 --> 25:11.700
Almost.

25:11.834 --> 25:12.934
Huh.

25:13.066 --> 25:13.967
You want me to add
a touch of white?

25:14.100 --> 25:15.900
Break it up a bit?

25:16.033 --> 25:16.934
Yes!

25:17.066 --> 25:18.100
Okay.

25:18.233 --> 25:19.200
Great idea.

25:21.567 --> 25:23.433
Hate to interrupt Space Blast.

25:23.567 --> 25:25.033
Galaxy Blast.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.600
Oh! Oh! Oh!

25:26.734 --> 25:27.867
Why?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.600
I was just about to
beat Sal's high score.

25:29.734 --> 25:32.100
Well, I'm gonna
be frank with you.

25:32.233 --> 25:33.200
I haven't heard
that one before.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.300
I need your help.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.066
Help me recreate
Mama's classics.

25:38.233 --> 25:39.266
Come on.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.266
I'm still gonna give
you a chance to show me

25:40.400 --> 25:41.800
your version of the menu.

25:41.934 --> 25:45.033
Why is recreating the original
Mama's so important to you?

25:45.166 --> 25:48.734
Why are you so opposed to
bringing back the classics?

25:48.867 --> 25:50.934
Okay, I will think about it.

25:51.066 --> 25:52.533
Okay, great.

25:52.667 --> 25:53.900
Thank you.

25:54.033 --> 25:55.033
When are we sampling?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.367
Oh, uh, yeah.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.533
Meet me in the dining room
in two hours for dinner.

25:59.667 --> 26:00.800
Okay.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.100
And bring an appetite.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.000
You don't hurry up, dinner's
gonna become breakfast.

26:11.133 --> 26:13.233
Okay, you really
shouldn't rush the chef.

26:14.900 --> 26:19.533
Here is your complete
sampling of Mama's new menu.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.667
Where do you wanna start?

26:24.800 --> 26:25.867
What's that one?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.800
Ah, these are roast
branzino with tomatoes,

26:27.934 --> 26:29.700
potatoes, and olives.

26:31.066 --> 26:32.066
You know what it's not?

26:32.200 --> 26:33.066
What?

26:33.200 --> 26:34.200
Mama's penne.

26:35.233 --> 26:36.133
I know.

26:36.266 --> 26:37.166
That's Mama's right here.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.633
Oh.

26:38.767 --> 26:40.300
Great!

26:40.433 --> 26:42.600
Here we go.

26:46.133 --> 26:48.600
It's hot.

26:48.734 --> 26:50.600
Not very adventurous, are ya?

26:50.734 --> 26:51.834
Adventurous?

26:51.967 --> 26:53.166
Not when it comes
to habanero penne.

26:53.300 --> 26:54.600
It's habiata.

26:54.734 --> 26:56.633
Look, the menu's sort
of become a fusion.

26:56.767 --> 26:58.934
It's Mama's classics
with a little more edge.

26:59.066 --> 27:01.066
Old and the new,
come together as one.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.934
And how did you
end up at Mama's?

27:04.867 --> 27:06.667
Ah, eh, Lorenzo!

27:06.800 --> 27:07.900
Tiramisu?

27:08.033 --> 27:09.166
Comin'
right up, Frankie!

27:09.300 --> 27:10.200
You're deflecting.

27:10.333 --> 27:11.400
I'm not deflecting.

27:11.533 --> 27:12.400
You are. There's
a story there.

27:12.533 --> 27:13.400
I'd like to hear it.
- No story.

27:13.533 --> 27:14.400
I applied, she hired me.

27:14.533 --> 27:15.500
That's the end of it.

27:15.633 --> 27:16.834
Ah. Here, perfect.

27:18.133 --> 27:19.000
Try some, go ahead.

27:19.133 --> 27:20.000
Thanks.

27:20.133 --> 27:21.166
You got it, boss.

27:23.467 --> 27:28.734
You know, I'm more
of a cannoli girl.

27:28.867 --> 27:30.867
Are you a picky eater?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.333
No.

27:32.467 --> 27:34.333
Oh my gosh, no wonder
you're so opposed to my menu.

27:34.467 --> 27:36.233
Your tastes are less
branzino habiata,

27:36.367 --> 27:38.700
more chicken nuggets,
mac and cheese.

27:38.834 --> 27:40.333
Who doesn't love chicken
nuggets and mac and cheese?

27:40.467 --> 27:42.000
Oh, we could sample
the kid's menu instead.

27:42.133 --> 27:43.533
Okay, now you're
being obnoxious.

27:43.667 --> 27:46.667
I will try your famous
tiramisu one day.

27:46.800 --> 27:47.834
Well, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

27:47.967 --> 27:48.967
Great.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.867
Now that I've sampled
some of Frank's fusion,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.767
how about you try
something for me?

28:01.100 --> 28:02.400
Can I get Mama's Flight?

28:02.533 --> 28:03.734
- You got it.
- Thank you.

28:03.867 --> 28:05.066
Mama's Flight?

28:05.200 --> 28:06.066
Yeah.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.300
All Mama's favorite wines.

28:07.433 --> 28:09.066
I'm surprised you didn't
know about this place.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.300
Nice place.

28:11.433 --> 28:13.734
Thanks.

28:13.867 --> 28:15.633
Chianti.

28:15.767 --> 28:20.433
Light, fruity.

28:20.567 --> 28:22.133
It's comforting.

28:22.266 --> 28:23.633
Well, this was
our drink of choice

28:23.767 --> 28:26.734
whenever we'd have long
talks about life and love.

28:26.867 --> 28:29.066
And this

28:30.700 --> 28:35.233
is a Meroni.

28:36.934 --> 28:38.300
Mmm.

28:38.433 --> 28:39.600
Bold.

28:39.734 --> 28:40.934
Yeah, well that's why
Mama associated that one

28:41.066 --> 28:43.900
with the rush of
taking risks in life.

28:45.900 --> 28:48.400
Is that one familiar at all?

28:52.867 --> 28:54.300
It's Masseto.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.433
Mama and Papa's favorite.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.300
Exactly.

28:57.433 --> 29:00.166
I checked the stock room.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.000
Why aren't we carrying any
of Mama's favorite wines?

29:02.133 --> 29:03.533
Oh, we had to scale back.

29:03.667 --> 29:05.533
I mean, as our customer base
slowed, so did our demand.

29:05.667 --> 29:07.300
Sure, but as you
lose the staples,

29:07.433 --> 29:08.867
you lose Mama's memory.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.800
I mean, you don't want people
to forget about her, do you?

29:11.934 --> 29:13.533
No.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.066
No, no, of course not.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.200
Hey, well, that's why we
need to go back to the basics.

29:18.333 --> 29:19.934
We need more Mama, not less.

29:22.834 --> 29:26.033
So does this, uh, this
new reboot idea of yours

29:26.166 --> 29:28.033
mean you're stickin' around?

29:28.166 --> 29:29.633
I, uh.

29:29.767 --> 29:31.000
Maybe.

29:31.133 --> 29:34.300
Could be a way for me to
make things right again.

29:34.433 --> 29:35.400
Make things right?

29:36.266 --> 29:37.800
Yeah.

29:37.934 --> 29:39.467
Aesthetically, you know?

29:39.600 --> 29:40.633
Yeah.

29:40.767 --> 29:41.867
You ready for one more stop?

29:42.000 --> 29:42.967
Do I have a choice?

29:43.100 --> 29:44.200
Drink up.

29:44.333 --> 29:45.567
The Masseto's expensive.

29:48.100 --> 29:50.633
You're awfully quiet
all the way here.

29:50.767 --> 29:52.300
Didn't wanna make
any sudden moves.

29:52.433 --> 29:54.633
Your tastes may be
safe, but your driving?

29:54.767 --> 29:56.367
Ha! Another story.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.633
I was so far from that
man when I parallel parked.

30:00.767 --> 30:02.867
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.

30:04.266 --> 30:05.533
There it is.

30:05.667 --> 30:07.867
Mama and Papa's first
apartment here in the States.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.633
That's where she dreamed
of making her mark

30:09.767 --> 30:13.000
on the culinary world and
then accomplished so much.

30:13.133 --> 30:14.734
There's so much history there.

30:16.133 --> 30:20.467
Seasons change,
history remains, huh?

30:20.600 --> 30:25.367
Poetic.

30:25.500 --> 30:30.633
I wanted to show
you something, look.

30:30.767 --> 30:32.367
1972.

30:32.500 --> 30:33.700
Ah.

30:33.834 --> 30:37.367
Mama's opened exactly
50 years ago this year.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.667
What better way to honor
her memory than to reopen

30:39.800 --> 30:41.700
on the 50th anniversary?

30:41.834 --> 30:42.700
The 15th?

30:42.834 --> 30:43.800
Yeah.

30:43.934 --> 30:45.100
That's two weeks away.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.166
What happened to our
one month timeline?

30:48.300 --> 30:50.667
We'll, we'll just
expedite the schedule

30:50.800 --> 30:52.633
so the reopening coincides
with the anniversary.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.700
It will be a lot of
work, but we can do it.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.133
Mama will be our guide.

30:56.266 --> 30:58.000
Seems overly ambitious,
don't ya think?

30:59.934 --> 31:01.200
Oh, gotta take this.

31:01.333 --> 31:02.367
Excuse me.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.367
This is Frank.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.033
Hey, Frank, how you doin'?

31:05.166 --> 31:07.867
It's Wallace here over
at Reggio's on 52nd.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.433
You may have heard that
we're getting ready

31:09.567 --> 31:11.367
to open in a couple of weeks.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.467
Listen, I heard that you are
on the hunt for a new gig.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.266
I have an opening for you.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.900
Yeah, talk to me.

31:28.667 --> 31:30.100
Ah, we're reopening
in two weeks.

31:30.233 --> 31:31.400
Two weeks?

31:31.533 --> 31:33.033
That's fast.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.033
You worried?

31:34.166 --> 31:35.300
Was. Not anymore.

31:37.066 --> 31:38.266
Got an interview.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.400
Interview what?

31:39.533 --> 31:40.433
At Reggio's.

31:40.567 --> 31:41.934
Looking for a new head chef.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.700
If all goes according
to plan, uh,

31:44.667 --> 31:45.734
think I'm leavin' Mama's.

31:45.867 --> 31:47.033
What do you mean
you're leaving Mama's?

31:47.166 --> 31:48.266
Shh, shh, shh.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.433
Look, you know I wanna
do my own thing, right?

31:49.567 --> 31:50.500
Doesn't look like I can
do that here anymore.

31:50.633 --> 31:51.734
- You can't.
- Just-

31:51.867 --> 31:53.200
Gather around, everyone!

31:53.333 --> 31:54.700
Talk later.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.867
All right.

32:00.066 --> 32:03.433
Our timeline just got
a little bit tighter.

32:03.567 --> 32:05.600
The 50th anniversary of
Mama's is in two weeks,

32:05.734 --> 32:08.133
and we're aiming
to be open by then.

32:08.266 --> 32:10.934
I even took out an ad in
The Times to celebrate.

32:11.066 --> 32:14.266
And, to lighten your load,
I'm gonna bring in more crew.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.500
Sound good?

32:15.633 --> 32:19.266
Uh, good is not the
word for it.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.800
Oops, didn't think
you could hear me.

32:20.934 --> 32:24.300
Was hoping you'd be more
of a team player, Frank?

32:24.433 --> 32:25.767
Loyal associate.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.100
Amy, we're a family
here at Mama's, okay?

32:28.233 --> 32:29.867
Not corporate employees.

32:31.867 --> 32:32.767
Hmm.

32:32.900 --> 32:33.867
No, you're right.

32:35.800 --> 32:36.800
Well.

32:36.934 --> 32:37.834
On what?

32:37.967 --> 32:39.166
You're right.

32:39.300 --> 32:40.500
We're a family.

32:40.633 --> 32:41.800
Absolutely.

32:41.934 --> 32:43.000
Yeah.

32:43.133 --> 32:45.000
I'd also like
us to be friends.

32:45.133 --> 32:46.667
Well, you wanna be my friend?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.600
I propose a compromise.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.800
We'll carry the
old with the new.

32:50.934 --> 32:53.100
Some of Mama's recipes
and some of yours.

32:53.233 --> 32:54.600
Mama did love a compromise.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.834
Okay, yeah, we can be friends.

32:59.967 --> 33:02.233
All right, so then
how about you brush up

33:02.367 --> 33:04.934
on Mama's recipes and
I'll go handle the hiring?

33:07.533 --> 33:10.066
Menu is your territory, right?

33:10.200 --> 33:11.367
Yeah, right.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.367
Right.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.567
Okay, all right.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.000
Let's all go home
and get some sleep.

33:15.133 --> 33:17.667
We'll come back tomorrow
rested and ready to go.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.333
We can do this!

33:19.467 --> 33:25.734
Yeah!

33:25.867 --> 33:27.600
all around the restaurant.

33:27.734 --> 33:29.600
These are rich with
history, so let's put them

33:29.734 --> 33:30.934
back up where they belong.

33:31.066 --> 33:34.767
There's some of Mama,
Italy, Papa, of course.

33:34.900 --> 33:37.433
Recapture the spirit of Mama's.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.033
Here at Mama's we are
lookin' for somebody

33:45.166 --> 33:47.900
who is enthusiastic
and hardworking.

33:48.033 --> 33:48.900
Responsible.

33:49.033 --> 33:49.900
Punctual.

33:50.033 --> 33:51.266
Tenacious.

33:56.233 --> 33:58.934
Someone who is excited
to come to work everyday.

33:59.066 --> 34:01.600
Someone who wants to
be part of our family,

34:01.734 --> 34:03.333
because here at Mama's
it's not just the food,

34:03.467 --> 34:05.834
it's the people who make
this place so special.

34:05.967 --> 34:07.800
Now I know you already
have another job,

34:07.934 --> 34:10.100
but the qualifications
are impeccable,

34:10.233 --> 34:11.934
your years of
experience impressive,

34:12.066 --> 34:14.000
and your baked goods
are out of this world,

34:14.133 --> 34:15.734
so if you're looking
for some extra hours,

34:15.867 --> 34:16.767
I'd love to bring you on.

34:16.900 --> 34:18.100
What do you say?

34:18.233 --> 34:19.433
I say sign me up.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.266
I'm so glad we're gonna
be working together again.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.133
Oh, I'm so happy you
offer such a generous

34:24.266 --> 34:25.367
employee discount!

34:26.300 --> 34:27.266
Okay!

34:27.400 --> 34:28.166
Okay, no, I'm happy to
work together with you.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.200
Okay.

34:31.767 --> 34:34.934
Didn't realize there was
a tornado in the forecast.

34:37.066 --> 34:38.600
I'm a little rusty
on Mama's old recipes.

34:38.734 --> 34:40.100
Feeling any less rusty?

34:40.233 --> 34:41.100
Eh.

34:41.233 --> 34:42.667
When's the last time you ate?

34:42.800 --> 34:44.233
Why do you ask?

34:46.467 --> 34:47.834
Come in!

34:47.967 --> 34:49.800
Hope this pairs well
with whatever takeout

34:49.934 --> 34:51.266
you're ordering for us tonight.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.467
What are you doing?

34:52.600 --> 34:53.767
I'm not ordering takeout.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.800
I'm gonna make you a
spaghetti di Maria.

34:55.934 --> 34:57.166
Oh, really?

34:57.300 --> 34:58.433
Okay.

34:58.567 --> 35:00.667
Having said that, I'm
not really a good chef,

35:00.800 --> 35:03.333
hence my landing on the
management side.

35:03.467 --> 35:04.734
You're like Papa.

35:04.867 --> 35:06.433
I guess that
makes you like Mama.

35:11.033 --> 35:13.900
So I may need some of your
chef skills to

35:14.033 --> 35:16.000
fill in any knowledge
gaps I might have.

35:16.133 --> 35:17.667
I doubt you'll need
any help from me.

35:17.800 --> 35:18.667
Well, you know.

35:20.667 --> 35:22.734
On second thought,

35:22.867 --> 35:24.333
what could it hurt?

35:24.467 --> 35:25.734
Hmm.

35:25.867 --> 35:28.400
Use Parmesan instead of...

35:28.533 --> 35:29.400
You're doing great.

35:29.533 --> 35:30.900
- Am I?
- Doing great.

35:31.033 --> 35:32.066
This is hard work.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.333
Not, not too much.

35:33.467 --> 35:34.667
It's fun, though, right?

35:37.967 --> 35:39.734
There you go.

35:41.867 --> 35:42.834
See? Simple.

35:46.533 --> 35:47.567
Mmm.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.000
I forgot how delicious that was.

35:50.133 --> 35:51.667
Isn't kind of hard
not to think about her

35:51.800 --> 35:53.467
when making her specialties?

35:56.367 --> 36:01.233
It's been the toughest
part for me, yeah.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.133
When was the last
time you two spoke?

36:03.266 --> 36:05.233
Oh, we checked in here and
there over the past few months,

36:05.367 --> 36:08.900
but the last thing I said
to her in person was,

36:10.934 --> 36:12.467
"Don't eat too much gnocci."

36:14.600 --> 36:15.834
What about you?

36:20.600 --> 36:21.600
It's, uh.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.633
Hey, Emily. What's up?

36:24.767 --> 36:25.633
Oh, hey.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.467
Um, not much.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.800
Just a little problem.

36:29.934 --> 36:31.800
Big problem!

36:31.934 --> 36:35.066
Sorry, did Lorenzo
just say big problem?

36:35.200 --> 36:36.133
What's goin' on?

36:36.266 --> 36:37.133
I don't know.

36:37.266 --> 36:38.433
Ah, nothing, Frank.

36:38.567 --> 36:39.633
It's this stove, we're
trying to fire it up.

36:39.767 --> 36:41.300
Frank, the thing is kaput.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.567
It's not, eh.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.767
You could be a little
more tactful, you know?

36:43.900 --> 36:44.967
What, there's no
use dancin' around it.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.400
Well, you could dance
a little around it.

36:46.533 --> 36:47.400
It's fine, Frank.

36:47.533 --> 36:48.834
We're almost there.

36:48.967 --> 36:50.400
That stove has been in
desperate need of a tuneup.

36:50.533 --> 36:51.467
We just hadn't
gotten around to it.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.467
It's this thing right
here, I'm telling you, yeah.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.400
The soft open is in two days.

36:56.533 --> 36:57.834
Can we fix it before then?

36:58.900 --> 37:01.800
Uh...

37:01.934 --> 37:03.033
All right.

37:03.166 --> 37:04.200
Lift this up.
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

37:04.333 --> 37:05.200
Just gonna lean
over a little bit.

37:05.333 --> 37:06.533
Okay, go ahead.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.867
- Oh, I got it.
- Nice.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.300
I think I got it.

37:09.433 --> 37:10.867
I don't got it.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.633
Hmm.

37:17.100 --> 37:17.967
Hmm.

37:21.633 --> 37:24.500
I paired my
gnocci with my ragu sauce

37:24.633 --> 37:26.500
for the food festival.

37:26.633 --> 37:29.500
It fit together
like me and Papa.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.433
The perfect match.

37:33.633 --> 37:37.834
Hey, Frank,
you gotta try the pizza!

37:37.967 --> 37:38.967
Gnocci ragu.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.133
Extra for you.

37:40.266 --> 37:41.233
Thank you.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.700
Mmm.

37:46.834 --> 37:48.266
You two make quite the team.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.400
Jacob.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.133
I'm an accountant
and also an investor.

37:54.266 --> 37:55.633
Come by for a
business consultation.

37:55.767 --> 37:59.166
I think I may be able to
help you expand Mama's.

37:59.300 --> 38:00.967
Here's my fee, I marked it down.

38:03.333 --> 38:06.233
That's very kind of you,
but I'm afraid we still

38:06.367 --> 38:07.533
can't afford this.

38:10.900 --> 38:13.767
I'm also looking for a
little help around the office.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.934
Errands, paperwork.

38:16.066 --> 38:17.934
Gopher-type tasks.

38:18.066 --> 38:19.533
Maybe we could work out a deal.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.100
I'll do it.

38:23.233 --> 38:24.934
Roberto, but you
already have a job.

38:25.066 --> 38:26.233
I can work nights.

38:26.367 --> 38:28.467
And maybe I'll pick up
some budgeting tips.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.767
I believe in you.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.400
When can I start?

38:34.533 --> 38:36.767
I think you just did.

38:36.900 --> 38:39.433
Ah, what Papa
proved is hard work

38:39.567 --> 38:41.767
and opportunity
can come together

38:41.900 --> 38:46.700
and create a beautiful recipe
that we called good fortune.

38:46.834 --> 38:48.700
Well, I did what I could.

38:50.233 --> 38:51.700
Needs a new spark module.

38:51.834 --> 38:54.600
Without that, the oven is
just a giant paperweight.

38:54.734 --> 38:56.700
So we'll order a new part.

38:56.834 --> 38:57.700
It's just a small hiccup.

38:57.834 --> 38:59.233
Well, good luck finding one.

38:59.367 --> 39:00.767
This thing's from the '60s.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.800
I don't even know if they
make replacement parts

39:02.934 --> 39:04.033
for it anymore.

39:04.166 --> 39:06.166
Okay, so it's a bad
case of the hiccups,

39:06.300 --> 39:09.033
but we'll just dig
in and work harder.

39:10.233 --> 39:12.633
We could just get
a brand-new stove.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.166
It's just a part, Frank.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.767
There's no need to replace
Mama's original stove

39:16.900 --> 39:18.500
for one part.

39:18.633 --> 39:20.600
If we find it, can you fix it?

39:20.734 --> 39:22.100
Yes, ma'am.

39:23.767 --> 39:24.834
Yeah, all right.

39:24.967 --> 39:26.934
I'll, I'll, I'll
help you find it.

39:27.066 --> 39:27.934
Great.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.333
Thank you.

39:29.467 --> 39:31.400
We'll scour the city
first thing tomorrow.

39:35.467 --> 39:37.000
Didn't put up much of a fight.

39:37.133 --> 39:38.266
Huh?

39:38.400 --> 39:40.100
Who is this softy
and what has he done

39:40.233 --> 39:42.333
with the bold as brass
Frank Rossi, huh?

39:42.467 --> 39:43.767
I was being a team player.

39:43.900 --> 39:44.800
Oh, is that what it was?

39:44.934 --> 39:46.033
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

39:46.166 --> 39:49.000
Plus, you know, this
soft open is a great way

39:49.133 --> 39:51.166
to get my menu out before
I take it elsewhere.

39:51.300 --> 39:53.433
Mmm, mmm, yeah, no.

39:53.567 --> 39:54.767
No, that's not what it is.

39:58.433 --> 39:59.867
Could it be?

40:02.133 --> 40:03.000
Nah.

40:03.133 --> 40:04.266
Nah is right.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.433
Mmm-hmm.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.000
No.

40:09.133 --> 40:10.500
Okay.
- Uh-huh.

40:10.633 --> 40:11.500
Frank.
- Yeah?

40:11.633 --> 40:12.533
Kitchen's that way.

40:12.667 --> 40:13.533
- I know.
- Uh-huh.

40:13.667 --> 40:14.934
Kitchen's in there.

40:32.567 --> 40:36.133
My famous wedding
soup is best served

40:36.266 --> 40:38.667
with a little spontaneity.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.433
Surprise, amore mio.

40:40.567 --> 40:43.500
Surprise doesn't even
begin to describe it.

40:43.633 --> 40:45.967
How did you do all of
this without my knowing?

40:46.100 --> 40:48.166
The rooftop was
completely empty before.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.767
I snuck away during
your busiest hours.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.767
Slowly brought things
up one at a time.

40:53.967 --> 40:56.133
I tried to make an
amazing wedding soup.

40:56.266 --> 40:57.700
Seemed appropriate for today.

40:58.800 --> 40:59.934
I just hope it's edible.

41:00.133 --> 41:01.600
I'm sure it's perfect.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.834

41:13.667 --> 41:16.000
What did I say?

41:16.133 --> 41:20.734
It's not you, it's just I
really am the luckiest girl

41:20.867 --> 41:21.967
in the whole world.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.734
And that must make
me the luckiest guy.

41:27.867 --> 41:29.900
I don't know what I
would do without you.

41:30.033 --> 41:32.400
You have sacrificed
so much for me.

41:32.533 --> 41:35.333
I'd do it over
again in a heartbeat.

41:35.467 --> 41:36.900
I love you, Roberto.

41:40.834 --> 41:42.667

42:12.266 --> 42:13.300
I love you.

42:13.433 --> 42:15.467
I love you.

42:26.433 --> 42:29.500
Yeah, I've been, uh,
flippin' through it.

42:30.767 --> 42:31.734
Come up here to read sometimes.

42:31.867 --> 42:32.900
It's peaceful.

42:36.767 --> 42:38.100
Oh, new project of mine.

42:38.233 --> 42:40.467
Basil, bay leaves, rosemary.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.934
There's something
beautiful about cultivating

42:42.066 --> 42:43.033
your life up here.

42:47.033 --> 42:48.500
Sorry, were you looking for me?

42:51.533 --> 42:54.433
Are you okay?

42:54.567 --> 42:57.567
Yeah, it's just been awhile
since I've been up here.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.700
My memories of Mama
hit especially hard
sometimes, I think.

43:00.834 --> 43:01.800
Yeah.

43:03.300 --> 43:08.033
Well, today was Mama and
Papa's wedding anniversary.

43:08.166 --> 43:11.133
Do you know they celebrated
up here every year?

43:11.266 --> 43:12.300
Had an inkling.

43:15.667 --> 43:17.166
Let's go get
that spark module.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.266
Yes.

43:20.834 --> 43:23.166
After a quick detour first.

43:23.300 --> 43:24.867
Come on.

43:30.967 --> 43:32.200
Little Italy?

43:32.333 --> 43:34.166
Mama's home away from home.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.066
I figure we could
celebrate Mama's and Papa's

43:37.200 --> 43:38.667
wedding anniversary
in her absence

43:38.800 --> 43:41.734
by visiting a few of
their favorite spots.

43:41.867 --> 43:43.433
And according to this,

43:44.633 --> 43:48.166
favorite gelato place should be

43:48.300 --> 43:50.567
right there.

43:50.700 --> 43:52.667
So is this little
excursion really just

43:52.800 --> 43:54.066
to celebrate Mama and Papa?

43:54.200 --> 43:55.967
It may also be a chance
for me to get to know

43:56.100 --> 43:57.033
my new friend.

43:57.166 --> 43:59.000
What do you wanna know?

43:59.133 --> 44:01.133
Well, you wanted to
keep Mama's memory alive,

44:01.266 --> 44:02.934
let's keep it alive.

44:03.066 --> 44:04.934
Tell me about what it was
like growing up with her.

44:05.066 --> 44:07.300
Well, she kind of
helped my dad raise me

44:07.433 --> 44:08.734
after we lost my mom.

44:10.100 --> 44:13.133
She became my surrogate mama.

44:13.266 --> 44:16.300
And she was just
always there for me,

44:16.433 --> 44:18.100
especially after my dad
retired and moved to Florida,

44:18.233 --> 44:19.467
left me the apartment.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.734
How traditionally
New York, eh?

44:22.900 --> 44:25.400
And she and Papa
both taught me better

44:25.533 --> 44:26.967
than to settle for second-best.

44:27.100 --> 44:28.467
Gosh, told me
everything about Papa.

44:28.600 --> 44:29.734
Yeah.

44:29.867 --> 44:31.567
You're really lucky
to have known him.

44:31.700 --> 44:33.233
Yeah.

44:33.367 --> 44:36.467
You know, you, uh,
you never told me about

44:36.600 --> 44:38.233
the last time you
and Mama spoke.

44:40.266 --> 44:42.567
You know, we should really
go find that spark thing.

44:42.700 --> 44:43.567
Aw, come on.

44:43.700 --> 44:45.133
Now you're deflecting.

44:45.266 --> 44:46.400
Come on.

44:46.533 --> 44:47.900
There's not much to tell.

44:48.033 --> 44:52.066
I mean, it was about a year
after I left Mama's and...

44:53.400 --> 44:54.266
Amy?

44:54.400 --> 44:55.266
Surprise!

44:55.400 --> 44:57.133
I haven't seen you in months!

44:57.266 --> 44:58.633
I know.

44:58.767 --> 45:00.133
I've been so busy
at the new job.

45:00.266 --> 45:01.734
It's unforgivable, I'm sorry.

45:05.767 --> 45:08.000
Well, Chow's more
about professionalism

45:08.133 --> 45:09.467
than getting your hands dirty.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.200
Oh, sounds like a lot of fun.

45:11.333 --> 45:13.033
I know.

45:13.166 --> 45:14.533
So, listen.

45:14.667 --> 45:16.200
I heard you guys were
going through a bit

45:16.333 --> 45:17.533
of a slump lately.

45:17.667 --> 45:18.800
No.

45:18.934 --> 45:20.000
The crew let me
in over the weekend,

45:20.133 --> 45:21.133
and I put together a
little surprise for you.

45:21.266 --> 45:22.133
What?

45:22.266 --> 45:23.233
Yeah, come see.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.700
What are we doing?

45:25.834 --> 45:30.467
I present to you,
Mama's on the Rooftop.

45:31.500 --> 45:32.367
It could be a whole
new experience,

45:32.500 --> 45:33.500
attract a younger crowd,

45:33.633 --> 45:35.300
make Mama's an even
hotter hot spot.

45:35.433 --> 45:36.400
What do you think?

45:38.100 --> 45:41.467
I think this is not Mama's.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.033
What do you mean?

45:44.166 --> 45:47.700
The rooftop was never
meant for business.

45:47.834 --> 45:53.033
It was always just
a special place for

45:53.166 --> 45:54.467
me and Papa.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.367
Yeah, I thought, I thought
you'd wanna share that

45:56.500 --> 45:57.367
with the world.

45:57.500 --> 45:58.734
I don't wanna share it.

46:00.066 --> 46:05.100
It's a sacred place for, for us.

46:05.233 --> 46:08.200
I just,

46:08.333 --> 46:10.233
I just wanted to
help boost business

46:10.367 --> 46:11.700
and modernize a bit.

46:11.834 --> 46:15.600
You know, I would just
hate to see Mama's close.

46:15.734 --> 46:17.333
We're not closing.

46:18.233 --> 46:20.367
We're doing just fine.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.200
We don't need any change.

46:22.333 --> 46:25.867
Please, take this
down before you go.

46:33.900 --> 46:36.400
And then life just got busy,

46:36.533 --> 46:38.600
and we exchanged messages,

46:38.734 --> 46:40.834
but we never got the
chance to reconcile.

46:40.967 --> 46:41.967
Or say goodbye.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.700
But I'll always be
her little tesoro.

46:44.834 --> 46:45.700
Wait a minute.

46:45.834 --> 46:46.700
What'd you say?

46:46.834 --> 46:48.400
- Tesoro?
- Mmm-hmm.

46:48.533 --> 46:50.367
She talked about you.

46:50.500 --> 46:51.367
What?

46:51.500 --> 46:52.867
Yes, all the time.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.867
She talked about her
tesoro, her treasure,

46:55.000 --> 46:56.867
how she missed you
dearly, how she loved you.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.533
I just realized she
was talkin' about you.

46:59.667 --> 47:01.166
You don't have to try
to make me feel better.

47:01.300 --> 47:02.300
No, trust me.

47:02.433 --> 47:03.333
I'm not known for
going out of my way

47:03.467 --> 47:04.567
to be sweet and comforting.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.333
I'm telling the truth, Amy.

47:11.900 --> 47:14.800
So, you ready for
detour number two?

47:14.934 --> 47:16.433
How many?

47:16.567 --> 47:18.600
Well, it's up to Mama
and Papa, isn't it?

47:22.900 --> 47:24.433
All right.

47:29.567 --> 47:32.000
This is supposed to be
where their favorite

47:32.133 --> 47:36.433
hotdog spot was, but
times change, I guess.

47:36.567 --> 47:38.033
But history remains, right?

47:39.467 --> 47:41.600
Right.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.333
Let me ask you the same
question you asked me.

47:43.467 --> 47:45.867
What kind of impact
did Mama have on you?

47:47.133 --> 47:49.667
Saved me from myself in a way.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.066
Used to be a little hard headed.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.200
No!

47:54.066 --> 47:56.600
There are remnants of
the old Frank there, maybe.

47:56.734 --> 47:57.834
I'm human, after all.

47:57.967 --> 48:00.533
It's just a defense
mechanism, you know.

48:00.667 --> 48:02.700
Is that right, Dr. Drew?

48:04.533 --> 48:06.834
I've seen glimpses
of the real Frank,

48:06.967 --> 48:08.367
the one who saw I was
having a tough time

48:08.500 --> 48:11.066
on the roof and orchestrated
an anniversary getaway

48:11.200 --> 48:12.066
to cheer me up.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.066
Yeah, don't mention it.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.333
I mean that.

48:15.467 --> 48:16.800
It's getting a little
too sentimental in here.

48:17.867 --> 48:19.500
Oh-ho!

48:19.633 --> 48:20.734
Look at this!

48:20.867 --> 48:23.567
Mama loved
knickknacks like this.

48:23.700 --> 48:24.800
It's us!

48:26.300 --> 48:27.333
It's cute.

48:27.467 --> 48:28.433
I'll take it.

48:29.967 --> 48:31.233
What are you
gonna do with that?

48:31.367 --> 48:32.233
What am I gonna do?

48:32.367 --> 48:33.400
We'll find a spot for it.

48:33.533 --> 48:35.066
And I love what it represents.

48:35.200 --> 48:39.166
Friendship is all
about understanding
and trust, honesty.

48:39.300 --> 48:40.600
All the things we have now.

48:42.133 --> 48:43.500
Right.

48:43.633 --> 48:45.066
So where to next?

48:45.200 --> 48:46.367
Last stop.

48:46.500 --> 48:47.834
This one's a special one.

48:49.033 --> 48:51.333
Thank you.

48:51.467 --> 48:54.900
Mama's recipe
for a successful marriage.

49:00.367 --> 49:01.800
I didn't think we'd
get a moment of peace

49:01.934 --> 49:05.133
and quiet today.

49:08.700 --> 49:09.800
Hmm.

49:09.934 --> 49:12.200
You're nervous about the future.

49:13.600 --> 49:18.066
It's a good nervous.

49:18.200 --> 49:21.967
Here.

49:22.100 --> 49:24.567
This is a worry.

49:24.700 --> 49:25.567
No.

49:25.700 --> 49:27.600
This is a rock.

49:27.734 --> 49:30.800
Yes, but imagine it's a worry,

49:30.934 --> 49:32.900
a fear, a problem.

49:34.367 --> 49:37.934
Hold onto it for a second,
but only for a second.

49:38.066 --> 49:40.967
And then...

49:41.100 --> 49:42.233
Oh!

49:43.367 --> 49:46.100
Let go!

49:46.233 --> 49:48.133
My father put a lot
of pressure on me

49:48.266 --> 49:50.633
to make something of
myself like my brothers did

49:50.767 --> 49:52.133
back in Tuscany.

49:52.266 --> 49:53.633
They all had made their
mark in the wine industry,

49:53.767 --> 49:55.767
but I had other plans.

49:55.900 --> 49:59.166
It was my mother who encouraged
me to follow my heart.

50:01.567 --> 50:04.767
And look what happened.

50:04.900 --> 50:05.934
It led me to you.

50:12.567 --> 50:15.967
Hmm?

50:18.433 --> 50:19.800
Don't you feel lighter?

50:19.934 --> 50:21.233
Much lighter.

50:24.200 --> 50:25.900
We should get back
before the reception.

50:26.033 --> 50:27.567
Okay, but first,

50:28.700 --> 50:31.300
one for each of my new in-laws.

50:31.433 --> 50:32.800
Hey!

50:34.200 --> 50:36.633
Recipe for a
successful marriage.

50:36.767 --> 50:40.400
One part trust, one
part communication,

50:40.533 --> 50:43.133
and many parts wine and pasta.

50:45.200 --> 50:46.166
That tracks.

50:47.533 --> 50:48.900
You know, Mama had
a new lesson for me

50:49.033 --> 50:50.233
every time I came to work.

50:51.700 --> 50:52.767
Guess I could look at
these as all the ones

50:52.900 --> 50:53.900
we never got to.

50:56.367 --> 50:59.567
You know, deep down
she forgives you,

50:59.700 --> 51:02.133
no matter what happened.

51:02.266 --> 51:05.200
You can let go.

51:05.333 --> 51:11.967
Hmm.

51:12.100 --> 51:17.133
Come here.

51:17.266 --> 51:18.867
Come here.

51:24.600 --> 51:27.533
All right, give me that.

51:46.533 --> 51:48.200
hat?

51:48.333 --> 51:49.667
I cannot believe
you found a place

51:49.800 --> 51:51.667
that sells vintage
appliance parts.

51:51.800 --> 51:52.900
I knew a guy.

51:53.033 --> 51:54.033
I mean, key to finding
anything in this city,

51:54.166 --> 51:55.033
you gotta know a guy.

51:55.166 --> 51:56.333
I was very impressed.

51:56.467 --> 51:57.500
You're so much more
than just the weirdo

51:57.633 --> 51:58.667
I met that the coffee shop.

51:58.800 --> 52:00.400
You love calling me weird.

52:00.533 --> 52:01.467
It was cute.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.400
Listen, thank you for today.

52:03.533 --> 52:05.800
It's been tough doing
this without her.

52:05.934 --> 52:07.400
I think it's made
me a little messy

52:07.533 --> 52:09.400
in terms of how I've been
handling things around here.

52:09.533 --> 52:10.700
Messy's okay sometimes.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.633
Uh, eh, it's your stop.

52:17.767 --> 52:19.633
I'm gonna go pick
up a few more things

52:19.767 --> 52:21.066
for the soft open tomorrow.

52:23.533 --> 52:24.767
Mmm-hmm.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.033
All right.

52:26.166 --> 52:27.166
Uh, Frank?

52:28.767 --> 52:31.133
Were you gonna ask me
out when we first met

52:31.266 --> 52:32.400
at the coffee shop?

52:32.533 --> 52:33.867
Is that why you were
acting so weird?

52:34.000 --> 52:34.900
What?

52:35.033 --> 52:35.934
At?

52:36.066 --> 52:37.033
The?

52:39.266 --> 52:40.800
Okay, it's just
too bad, because I,

52:40.934 --> 52:43.033
I think there's a chance
I might've said yes.

52:44.934 --> 52:49.133
Uh.

53:04.433 --> 53:05.500
She's as good as new.

53:05.633 --> 53:07.200
Just in time.

53:16.266 --> 53:17.967
Papa made the
perfect cappuccino.

53:18.100 --> 53:22.100
His secret, that extra
splash of espresso.

54:25.033 --> 54:25.934
Hey, boss lady.

54:26.066 --> 54:27.200
What you doin'?

54:27.333 --> 54:28.767
Ah, I was just reading
about how Mama and Papa

54:28.900 --> 54:30.900
got together at
this little cafe.

54:31.033 --> 54:32.867
Oh, kind of like how
you and Frank met, hmm?

54:33.000 --> 54:34.433
I know what you're implying.

54:34.567 --> 54:36.233
But no, it's a little
different, actually.

54:36.367 --> 54:38.033
Hmm, interesting.

54:38.166 --> 54:40.867
Tell me, where did
you two go yesterday

54:41.000 --> 54:43.367
that was so important
you had to cancel

54:43.500 --> 54:44.934
drinks with me?

54:45.066 --> 54:46.533
It was pretty important.

54:46.667 --> 54:47.734
Mmm-hmm.

54:47.867 --> 54:49.600
We had to find a spare
part for the stove.

54:49.734 --> 54:51.200
Mmm.

54:51.333 --> 54:52.633
Oh, but first we went for a
little walk in Little Italy,

54:52.767 --> 54:54.033
and then we went to this
cute, little flea market,

54:54.166 --> 54:56.100
and then to the East River.

54:58.834 --> 55:00.100
He pulled a Mama.

55:00.934 --> 55:01.834
A what?

55:01.967 --> 55:03.600
A reverse date.

55:03.734 --> 55:05.800
It's how she and
Papa got together.

55:05.934 --> 55:07.400
He didn't know he was
on a date until he was

55:07.533 --> 55:08.433
already on it.

55:08.567 --> 55:09.967
Oh, wow, that's genius.

55:10.100 --> 55:11.934
She was a genius!

55:12.066 --> 55:14.166
Listen, I need to go
put this stuff away,

55:14.300 --> 55:16.967
but this conversation
is not over.

55:17.100 --> 55:17.967
Okay.

55:18.100 --> 55:18.967
Not over, missy.

55:19.100 --> 55:20.066
Okay.

55:22.400 --> 55:23.467
Benvenuto.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.500
Mama's will be open
in just a few minutes.

55:25.633 --> 55:27.266
I had to be first
to make a reservation.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.500
The tiramisu looks delicious.

55:29.633 --> 55:30.934
I don't care what
that review said.

55:31.066 --> 55:32.967
If Mama loved it, I'm
sure I'll love it, too.

55:33.100 --> 55:35.133
Review? What review?

55:35.266 --> 55:37.100
The review from The Times.

55:38.900 --> 55:40.433
Oh, boy.

55:41.567 --> 55:42.467
He didn't tell you about this?

55:42.600 --> 55:43.767
No, no.

55:43.900 --> 55:45.300
He didn't tell his
boss that the menu

55:45.433 --> 55:47.567
he's been fighting so hard for
has been panned by critics.

55:47.700 --> 55:48.600
One critic.

55:48.734 --> 55:49.967
Kimberly Ramirez,

55:50.100 --> 55:51.600
the top critic in
all of New York.

55:51.734 --> 55:55.100
That's the equivalent of
like 10 really good critics.

55:55.233 --> 55:56.100
Fair.

55:56.233 --> 55:57.333
What are you gonna do?

55:57.467 --> 56:00.767
I wanted to give him a
chance, but after this?

56:03.533 --> 56:05.166
We can't serve his
menu at Mama's.

56:08.800 --> 56:09.700
All right, everyone.

56:09.834 --> 56:11.333
Gather round, please!

56:13.133 --> 56:15.400
So this is our first official
run through as a team,

56:15.533 --> 56:16.900
and I know that we
are going to make

56:17.033 --> 56:19.000
Mama and Papa very proud.

56:19.133 --> 56:21.200
So, Frank, of course, will cook.

56:21.333 --> 56:22.900
Sal and Christine
will host and serve.

56:23.033 --> 56:25.900
Lorenzo is going to take
care of everything else

56:26.033 --> 56:27.667
with the help of our new hires,

56:27.800 --> 56:30.400
and Emily and I will take
orders and run the cash.

56:30.533 --> 56:31.500
Sound good?

56:31.633 --> 56:32.533
Really?

56:32.667 --> 56:33.834
Your hard work has paid off.

56:33.967 --> 56:35.400
You've just been promoted.

56:37.700 --> 56:39.367
Okay, okay, okay, we're
officially on a time crunch,

56:39.500 --> 56:40.400
so let's prep.

56:40.533 --> 56:42.467
All right, all right, okay.

56:42.600 --> 56:43.533
Frank.

56:43.667 --> 56:44.667
Yeah?

56:44.800 --> 56:46.166
About the menu, take this.

56:46.300 --> 56:47.333
We're gonna make some changes,

56:47.467 --> 56:49.433
so if you have any
questions, let me know.

56:52.033 --> 56:55.567
Got it.

56:55.700 --> 56:57.500
So why'd the menu change?

56:57.633 --> 56:58.867
We're just gonna
keep things simple

56:59.000 --> 57:01.133
so we can serve more
customers more efficiently.

57:01.266 --> 57:02.133
Okay.

57:02.266 --> 57:03.433
Benvenuti, welcome to Mama's.

57:03.567 --> 57:05.133
All right, keep it tight.

57:05.266 --> 57:06.934
Knees lookin' weak,
Tom, let's go.

57:07.066 --> 57:07.967
Yup.

57:08.100 --> 57:08.967
Hey, how's it goin' here?

57:09.100 --> 57:10.133
- Oh, beautifully, Sal.
- Nice.

57:10.266 --> 57:11.567
Took me all morning,
but I pre-prepped

57:11.700 --> 57:13.800
quite a bit of my wild
mushroom crostini,

57:13.934 --> 57:15.934
branzino and pork chop frisee.

57:16.066 --> 57:17.133
Uh-oh.

57:17.266 --> 57:18.433
Uh-oh? What?

57:18.567 --> 57:21.033
Well, you didn't look
over the new prep sheet?

57:21.166 --> 57:22.066
Amy updated it.

57:22.200 --> 57:23.834
Only includes Mama's staples.

57:24.734 --> 57:25.967
Not now. What?

57:26.100 --> 57:27.734
Yeah, it's only the staples.

57:27.867 --> 57:29.133
You did prep that stuff, no?

57:29.266 --> 57:30.300
Yeah, no, of course.

57:30.433 --> 57:31.734
I just, I'm, I assumed
we'd be selling

57:31.867 --> 57:33.633
equal amount of my items, too.

57:33.767 --> 57:34.800
Oof.

57:34.934 --> 57:36.734
Why would she
change the menu, Sal?

57:36.867 --> 57:38.800
Hey, first order's
up for spaghetti,

57:38.934 --> 57:40.600
three chicken parm,
two fettucine.

57:40.734 --> 57:41.633
Three chicken parm?

57:41.767 --> 57:42.934
Okay, okay, okay.

57:43.066 --> 57:44.100
It's gonna take a
whole half an hour.

57:44.233 --> 57:45.133
It's okay, it's
okay, we got this.

57:45.266 --> 57:46.133
Let's go. Gonna help out.

57:46.266 --> 57:47.133
Let's jump in.

57:47.266 --> 57:48.200
The three chicken parms
all day, let's go.

57:48.333 --> 57:49.967
- Enjoy.
- Thank goodness.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.233
What is going on back there?

57:51.367 --> 57:52.433
Well, Frank didn't
prep enough of Mama's

57:52.567 --> 57:53.633
signature dishes.

57:53.767 --> 57:54.633
What, didn't he
get the changes?

57:54.767 --> 57:56.567
- I don't know.
- Well, what happened?

57:56.700 --> 57:57.567
Why didn't you tell me
you made these changes?

57:57.700 --> 57:58.934
- You tryin' to set me up?
- Set you up?

57:59.066 --> 57:59.934
I gave you the folder.

58:00.133 --> 58:01.300
All you had to do was open it.

58:01.433 --> 58:02.967
We agreed to use
my menu, remember?

58:03.100 --> 58:04.467
Yeah, that was before
I knew about the review

58:04.600 --> 58:05.500
in The Times.

58:05.633 --> 58:07.300
Oh, this is not good.

58:07.433 --> 58:09.367
I was gonna, I was
gonna tell you about that.

58:09.500 --> 58:10.800
When?

58:10.934 --> 58:12.133
A few weeks from now
after we already reopened?

58:12.266 --> 58:13.633
I was waiting
for the right time.

58:13.767 --> 58:15.467
You know what, it's really
hard to work with someone

58:15.600 --> 58:18.800
who doesn't reciprocate
trust and honesty

58:18.934 --> 58:20.200
and communication.

58:20.333 --> 58:21.200
Amy.

58:21.333 --> 58:22.200
I thought we had that.

58:22.333 --> 58:23.467
I thought we were friends.

58:26.100 --> 58:28.500
Okay, guess I was wrong.

58:28.633 --> 58:29.667
All right.

58:43.133 --> 58:46.400
No, look, I mean, this
is almost an exact replica.

58:46.533 --> 58:48.166
You know, I mean, almost.

58:49.867 --> 58:52.400
I haven't been able to say
goodbye to Galaxy Blast yet.

58:52.533 --> 58:55.233
Are you still thinking
about leaving for another job?

58:55.367 --> 58:56.900
My interview's this afternoon.

58:57.033 --> 58:58.400
It's a new era here, Sal.

58:58.533 --> 59:00.066
I'm just in the way.

59:00.200 --> 59:02.066
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second.

59:02.200 --> 59:04.066
You've never given up
on anything this easily.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.633
What aren't you telling me?

59:05.767 --> 59:06.633
Huh?

59:06.767 --> 59:07.633
It's Amy, isn't it?

59:07.767 --> 59:09.100
See, I knew it.

59:09.233 --> 59:10.633
Listen, you go in there,
you just be honest with her.

59:10.767 --> 59:12.400
You lay it all out, you earn
some of that trust back.

59:12.533 --> 59:14.133
It's not that
simple, Sal, okay?

59:14.266 --> 59:16.266
Being here is just
not my destino,

59:16.400 --> 59:17.500
and I've accepted that.

59:20.033 --> 59:22.233
Had a lot of good times
together, old pal.

59:22.367 --> 59:23.400
Yeah.

59:23.533 --> 59:24.967
Yeah, we have.

59:30.567 --> 59:31.800
You can help
me haul this in the back.

59:31.934 --> 59:33.600
Yeah.

59:38.533 --> 59:42.734
Pasta primavera
was Amy's favorite.

59:49.567 --> 59:50.600
Mama?

59:50.734 --> 59:51.800
Amy!

59:51.934 --> 59:53.066
Just in time.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.800
I'm making your
favorite, primavera.

59:54.934 --> 59:56.233
Can we talk?

59:56.367 --> 59:57.433
Sure.

59:57.567 --> 59:59.967
You talk, I listen,
and I make primavera.

1:00:00.100 --> 1:00:02.734
It's what we do.

1:00:04.100 --> 1:00:07.967
I got a job offer.

1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:09.734
Chow.

1:00:09.867 --> 1:00:10.967
In Midtown.

1:00:11.100 --> 1:00:12.934
They're looking for
an assistant manager.

1:00:13.066 --> 1:00:14.033
Oh.

1:00:16.367 --> 1:00:19.934
Um.

1:00:20.066 --> 1:00:22.400
You should take it.

1:00:22.533 --> 1:00:23.567
Really?

1:00:23.700 --> 1:00:24.767
Well, yeah.

1:00:24.900 --> 1:00:27.567
You know the restaurant
business in and out.

1:00:27.700 --> 1:00:30.233
Papa and I have
taught you everything.

1:00:30.367 --> 1:00:33.133
It's about time you got
to, uh, spread your wings

1:00:33.266 --> 1:00:36.800
and show the world
what you have to offer.

1:00:36.934 --> 1:00:40.100
I know, but this is the
only place I've ever worked,

1:00:40.233 --> 1:00:41.800
and it's so scary.

1:00:41.934 --> 1:00:44.066
You have to take
risks in order to have

1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:47.533
a rich, fulfilling,
successful life.

1:00:49.266 --> 1:00:53.734
Imagine if I stayed in the
same place my whole life.

1:00:53.867 --> 1:00:57.800
Well, all this would've
never have come to be, right?

1:00:57.934 --> 1:00:58.900
Yeah.

1:01:02.133 --> 1:01:05.667
How am I suppose to leave you?

1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:10.033
You know, when I lost
Papa all those years ago,

1:01:10.166 --> 1:01:11.467
I had two choices.

1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:13.367
I could continue to grieve,

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:16.300
or I could live life,

1:01:16.433 --> 1:01:19.633
loving the people who
are right in front of me.

1:01:19.767 --> 1:01:21.433
People like you.

1:01:23.333 --> 1:01:25.200
And it was hard losing Papa,

1:01:25.333 --> 1:01:27.467
and it'll be hard
when you leave.

1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:31.700
But, Amy, you'll never
get the chance to spread

1:01:31.834 --> 1:01:35.467
the love that you found here

1:01:37.433 --> 1:01:41.533
if I don't let you go.

1:01:43.767 --> 1:01:46.667
I'll come visit you
all the time, I promise.

1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:47.767
My tesoro.

1:01:49.166 --> 1:01:51.633
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

1:01:51.767 --> 1:01:53.800
You've done so
much more for me.

1:01:56.333 --> 1:01:57.433
We need a picture together.

1:01:57.567 --> 1:01:58.467
We need a photo.

1:01:58.600 --> 1:01:59.467
Okay.

1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:00.533
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:02:00.667 --> 1:02:01.567
Will you take a picture of us?

1:02:01.700 --> 1:02:03.200
Thank you.

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.367
Tiramisu di
Franco is a sweet reminder

1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:20.533
of the importance
of moving forward.

1:02:20.667 --> 1:02:24.867
Why'd you leave your
last job, Frank?

1:02:27.567 --> 1:02:28.767
Eh, what the heck.

1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:30.033
It's like my 10th interview
and no one's given

1:02:30.166 --> 1:02:31.200
me a shot yet and
why should they?

1:02:32.333 --> 1:02:33.200
I was too proud.

1:02:33.333 --> 1:02:35.367
I wanted to cook a certain way,

1:02:35.500 --> 1:02:37.100
my manager disagreed,

1:02:37.233 --> 1:02:38.700
and I was let go.

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:43.433
I deserved it.

1:02:43.567 --> 1:02:46.600
I had passion, but
I wasn't the boss.

1:02:46.734 --> 1:02:50.633
Lesson learned, right?

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:51.734
Thank you for your time.

1:02:51.867 --> 1:02:53.266
I'll see myself out.

1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:54.266
Appreciate it.

1:02:54.400 --> 1:02:55.500
No, no, come on, sit.

1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:57.867
You want an espresso?

1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:58.967
Uh, sure?

1:03:00.133 --> 1:03:01.000
Okay.

1:03:01.133 --> 1:03:03.200
Duo, espresso, per favore.

1:03:05.467 --> 1:03:07.600
Eh, relax.

1:03:07.734 --> 1:03:09.500
I appreciate your honesty.

1:03:09.633 --> 1:03:10.967
Yeah, blessing and a curse.

1:03:12.100 --> 1:03:13.066
I know that well.

1:03:15.266 --> 1:03:18.166
So what is it that
motivates you?

1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:20.600
I mean, why do you wanna cook?

1:03:21.767 --> 1:03:25.500
Cookin' to me,
it's, it's, it's food.

1:03:25.633 --> 1:03:27.333
Food is my safe place.

1:03:27.467 --> 1:03:30.767
It's my nonna and my
mom in the kitchen,

1:03:31.934 --> 1:03:33.433
whippin' up some maccugan dish.

1:03:33.567 --> 1:03:38.000
It's garlic and the olive
oil simmering in the pan.

1:03:38.133 --> 1:03:39.367
Best smell in the world.

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:42.767
And it's just feeling
instantly better

1:03:42.900 --> 1:03:45.934
when you walk in your
house, and you know,

1:03:46.066 --> 1:03:48.367
the sounds and the smells
of the kitchen, you know?

1:03:51.233 --> 1:03:54.266
It's love, it's family.

1:03:54.400 --> 1:03:55.266
That's what I wanna do.

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:57.200
I wanna, I wanna make a place

1:03:58.567 --> 1:04:00.166
for love, laughter and family.

1:04:00.300 --> 1:04:02.567
That simple, really.

1:04:02.700 --> 1:04:04.333
It's all I wanna do.

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:08.200
Okay.

1:04:13.533 --> 1:04:15.400
I can offer you a
couple of things.

1:04:15.533 --> 1:04:18.200
I can offer you a lot
of garlic and olive oil

1:04:18.333 --> 1:04:20.333
and a lot of fun in the kitchen.

1:04:20.467 --> 1:04:22.233
Does that interest you?

1:04:22.367 --> 1:04:24.233
You won't regret
this, Mrs. Tucci.

1:04:24.367 --> 1:04:25.500
I'm your guy, for sure.

1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:28.233
Call me Mama.

1:04:28.367 --> 1:04:29.400
Of course, Mama.

1:04:31.967 --> 1:04:32.900
Salute.

1:04:33.033 --> 1:04:34.700
Salute.

1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:39.900
Menu's prepped for tonight.

1:04:40.033 --> 1:04:41.400
Just experimenting
with a new dish.

1:04:41.533 --> 1:04:43.166
Mmm, duck?

1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:44.567
Duck sugo.

1:04:44.700 --> 1:04:46.100
Hmm.

1:04:46.233 --> 1:04:48.367
You know, Frank, you've been
doing a fantastic job here.

1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:51.066
You proved me right
by hiring you.

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:52.066
What can I say?

1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:53.333
I'm a changed man.

1:04:53.467 --> 1:04:55.900
Well, I'm gonna take a
little advice from Papa,

1:04:56.033 --> 1:04:59.734
and you know that I'm not
really that good at change.

1:04:59.867 --> 1:05:00.967
No.

1:05:02.934 --> 1:05:04.166
But, um.

1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:08.800
What's this?

1:05:08.934 --> 1:05:12.200
Every artist starts
with a blank canvas.

1:05:13.100 --> 1:05:16.800
You should make it your own.

1:05:16.934 --> 1:05:17.800
Me?

1:05:17.934 --> 1:05:18.900
You're ah...

1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:22.467
You trust me to
create my own menu?

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:24.934
You think you would
like to do that?

1:05:25.066 --> 1:05:26.433
Absolutely, yes!

1:05:26.567 --> 1:05:27.967
Yeah, I've been workin'
on a recipe for tiramisu.

1:05:28.100 --> 1:05:28.967
I think it'll be fantastic.

1:05:29.100 --> 1:05:30.233
Oh, great.

1:05:30.367 --> 1:05:31.500
Let's serve it tonight.

1:05:33.767 --> 1:05:35.066
Yes!

1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:44.300
Mmm.

1:05:44.433 --> 1:05:45.734
There you are.

1:05:45.867 --> 1:05:47.633
We put the finishing
touches in the dining room,

1:05:47.767 --> 1:05:49.900
and I put out a
basket of my biscotti.

1:05:51.533 --> 1:05:52.433
Are you okay?

1:05:52.567 --> 1:05:54.567
I've been doing it all wrong.

1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:55.767
Doing what wrong?

1:05:55.900 --> 1:05:57.734
Taking Mama's
back to square one.

1:05:59.367 --> 1:06:01.700
It's not what she wanted.

1:06:07.633 --> 1:06:10.000
d we he

1:06:10.133 --> 1:06:12.667
some final prep work to do.

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:14.367
Where's Frank?

1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:15.567
- Frank?
- Yeah.

1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:17.000
Frank stepped
out to the market.

1:06:17.133 --> 1:06:19.033
Uh, eh, grab some
tomatoes and peppers

1:06:19.166 --> 1:06:20.033
and things like that.

1:06:20.166 --> 1:06:21.934
Oh.

1:06:22.066 --> 1:06:23.033
Bummer.

1:06:23.166 --> 1:06:24.867
He's gonna miss the good news.

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:26.367
Change of plans.

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:29.333
We're gonna reincorporate
his items into the menu.

1:06:29.467 --> 1:06:30.700
- Nice.
- Yeah, okay?

1:06:30.834 --> 1:06:31.700
Okay.

1:06:31.834 --> 1:06:32.800
Cool.

1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:35.834
Okay, look.

1:06:35.967 --> 1:06:36.834
Don't panic, but
Frank's actually at

1:06:36.967 --> 1:06:38.400
a job interview right now.

1:06:38.533 --> 1:06:39.667
- What?
- Yeah.

1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:40.867
That seems like a
great reason to panic.

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:41.867
He can't leave.

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:43.500
I know.

1:06:43.633 --> 1:06:45.500
Well, we gotta get
'em to make up.

1:06:45.633 --> 1:06:46.700
Yeah, but how?

1:06:46.834 --> 1:06:47.800
How what?

1:06:49.367 --> 1:06:51.500
How beautiful is that coat?

1:06:51.633 --> 1:06:52.533
Is it new?

1:06:52.667 --> 1:06:53.567
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1:06:53.700 --> 1:06:55.233
Where you headin'?

1:06:55.367 --> 1:06:56.233
To talk to Frank.

1:06:56.367 --> 1:06:57.533
Did he go to Prospect Park?

1:06:57.667 --> 1:06:58.633
46th Street.

1:06:58.767 --> 1:06:59.667
Manhattan?

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:00.967
What's he doing in Manhattan?

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:02.233
Well, have you seen
the stock of tomatoes?

1:07:02.367 --> 1:07:03.266
The best in New York.

1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:04.467
You know Frank.

1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:05.767
Always going above
and beyond, so.

1:07:05.900 --> 1:07:08.967
Yeah, and I mean, I'm
sure he'll be back soon.

1:07:09.100 --> 1:07:10.266
You may as well just
wait for him here.

1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:12.266
No, I, I need some fresh air.

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:13.266
I'll see you in a bit.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:14.367
Yeah, see ya.

1:07:16.033 --> 1:07:16.934
So you're calling him, right?

1:07:17.066 --> 1:07:18.300
Yeah.

1:07:20.567 --> 1:07:21.900
Oh.

1:07:22.033 --> 1:07:22.900
Hey.

1:07:23.033 --> 1:07:25.400
Hey, so how'd it go?

1:07:25.533 --> 1:07:26.900
Couldn't of gone better.

1:07:28.266 --> 1:07:29.400
That's great.

1:07:29.533 --> 1:07:30.800
More importantly,
I realized something.

1:07:30.934 --> 1:07:33.133
I think I know what my
recipes have been missing.

1:07:33.266 --> 1:07:34.633
Yeah, you can tell
me about that later.

1:07:34.767 --> 1:07:36.734
Look, Amy's been
lookin' for you.

1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:38.967
You didn't-

1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:40.133
I didn't tell her
about the interview, no.

1:07:40.266 --> 1:07:41.433
Head over to the
46th Street market.

1:07:41.567 --> 1:07:42.633
I told her you were
picking up tomatoes.

1:07:42.767 --> 1:07:43.633
Okay, on it.

1:07:43.767 --> 1:07:44.734
Hey, thanks for covering.

1:08:05.500 --> 1:08:06.700
Frank.

1:08:06.834 --> 1:08:08.133
Hey.
- Amy, uh?

1:08:09.266 --> 1:08:11.300
What are you doing here?

1:08:11.433 --> 1:08:14.200
Uh, I actually came

1:08:14.333 --> 1:08:15.967
to apologize.

1:08:16.100 --> 1:08:17.000
You did?

1:08:17.133 --> 1:08:18.500
Yeah.

1:08:18.633 --> 1:08:19.867
I went a little overboard
trying to replicate Mama's,

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.100
and I shouldn't of dismissed
your contributions.

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:27.700
I was just so set on
making Mama proud that I,

1:08:27.834 --> 1:08:32.133
I kind of lost sight
of that very thing.

1:08:32.266 --> 1:08:33.467
What do you mean?

1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:36.000
I was reading
through her cookbook,

1:08:36.133 --> 1:08:37.767
and she included your recipes.

1:08:39.266 --> 1:08:40.700
I didn't realize she
had so much fait in you,

1:08:40.834 --> 1:08:44.266
and I didn't realize that she
was ready to embrace change.

1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:48.867
Yeah, well, it
wasn't exactly working.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.533
Well, maybe that's
because you were only

1:08:51.667 --> 1:08:52.800
one half of a team.

1:08:57.166 --> 1:08:58.934
I wanna move forward
with your menu.

1:09:00.133 --> 1:09:01.033
You do?

1:09:01.166 --> 1:09:02.033
Yeah.

1:09:02.166 --> 1:09:04.200
Mama's wishes should come first.

1:09:04.333 --> 1:09:07.233
And who cares what some
critic thinks, right?

1:09:07.367 --> 1:09:09.533
You know, I was really
embarrassed the other night

1:09:09.667 --> 1:09:10.934
at the soft open.

1:09:11.066 --> 1:09:12.433
Now I know I had
some fault, too.

1:09:12.567 --> 1:09:14.100
I should've talked to
you earlier one-on-one.

1:09:14.233 --> 1:09:16.700
I shouldn't have done that
in front of all those people.

1:09:17.734 --> 1:09:21.233
Hey, can we still be friends?

1:09:23.166 --> 1:09:24.166
Friends again.

1:09:25.834 --> 1:09:29.400
I'll see ya back at Mama's.

1:09:51.734 --> 1:09:53.033
Dear Amy.

1:09:53.166 --> 1:09:56.300
A new friend inspired
me to write this letter.

1:09:57.166 --> 1:10:00.934
Hey, Mama, I was, uh...

1:10:01.066 --> 1:10:02.767
Is everything okay?

1:10:02.900 --> 1:10:05.533
Yeah, it's okay.

1:10:05.667 --> 1:10:06.700
I, uh.

1:10:08.567 --> 1:10:12.066
I'm just thinkin'
about some of my life

1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:15.934
and one big regret.

1:10:16.066 --> 1:10:17.667
Yeah, I've got
plenty of those.

1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:24.934
You wanna tell me about it?

1:10:25.066 --> 1:10:28.100
I had a special friend.

1:10:28.233 --> 1:10:31.266
Mio tesoro.

1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:35.600
And we had this falling
out and it was really

1:10:35.734 --> 1:10:38.367
all my fault because
I had such a big,

1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:42.266
emotional reaction
and I pushed her away,

1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:46.700
and you know, life
goes by, time flies,

1:10:46.834 --> 1:10:49.033
and we all get busy.

1:10:50.066 --> 1:10:53.600
And we lost touch.

1:10:53.734 --> 1:10:56.266
Well, I believe
someone taught me

1:10:56.400 --> 1:10:59.100
that true friendship
can withstand anything.

1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:02.734
What would you do if
you were in my shoes?

1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:06.667
I'd write a letter.

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:08.633
I think there's something
special and comforting

1:11:08.767 --> 1:11:10.133
about receiving a tangible
memory that can be

1:11:10.266 --> 1:11:11.433
held onto forever.

1:11:13.233 --> 1:11:14.600
I was a shy kid.

1:11:14.734 --> 1:11:17.266
I wrote girls little notes
and poems all the time.

1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:18.433
I don't know.

1:11:18.567 --> 1:11:19.633
What a romantic.

1:11:19.767 --> 1:11:21.233
Oh, yeah, right.

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:25.433
You know, you're both
about the same age,

1:11:25.567 --> 1:11:29.100
and I, I do hope
one day you meet.

1:11:29.233 --> 1:11:32.166
Yeah, I'm not so
great at relationships.

1:11:32.300 --> 1:11:34.600
She'd really be having
to compromise with me.

1:11:34.734 --> 1:11:35.767
Mmm.

1:11:35.900 --> 1:11:36.767
Hey, when do you
leave for Napoli?

1:11:36.900 --> 1:11:37.867
Tomorrow night.

1:11:42.300 --> 1:11:43.333
All right, have fun.

1:11:44.633 --> 1:11:46.100
Don't eat too much gnocci.

1:11:47.233 --> 1:11:48.467
Water my plants.

1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:50.033
I got it, I got it.

1:11:58.633 --> 1:12:01.166
I'm sorry that
we've fallen out of touch.

1:12:01.300 --> 1:12:05.000
I take responsibility
for how I reacted,

1:12:05.133 --> 1:12:08.500
but the wonderful thing
about relationships is,

1:12:08.633 --> 1:12:11.667
they can withstand
just about anything.

1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:14.500
Life might change
and time may pass,

1:12:14.633 --> 1:12:16.734
but family is forever.

1:12:16.867 --> 1:12:18.667
Papa taught me that.

1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:21.500
And just like Papa, no
matter where you are,

1:12:21.633 --> 1:12:23.834
I'll always be there with you.

1:12:23.967 --> 1:12:26.400
Love always, Mama.

1:12:39.333 --> 1:12:43.500
Frank, wait.

1:12:43.633 --> 1:12:44.500
What's this?

1:12:44.633 --> 1:12:45.700
I found it in Mama's cookbook.

1:12:45.834 --> 1:12:47.333
She hadn't sent it to me.

1:12:47.467 --> 1:12:49.967
Did you tell her to
write this letter?

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.233
This is the closure
I never had with her

1:12:57.367 --> 1:12:59.100
and you helped me find that.

1:13:01.867 --> 1:13:05.734
You have no idea what
this means to me.

1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:09.233
Frank.

1:13:09.367 --> 1:13:10.400
Hey.

1:13:10.533 --> 1:13:11.400
Sorry to interrupt.

1:13:11.533 --> 1:13:13.266
This'll just take a moment.

1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:14.567
I don't know if you're aware,

1:13:14.700 --> 1:13:15.967
but this guy is one
tough nut to crack.

1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:17.767
He just won't give
me a straight answer.

1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:20.100
Look, Frank, I came by
tonight to see if there's

1:13:20.233 --> 1:13:22.467
anything else I can do
to sweeten the deal.

1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:25.367
Now we would love to have
you as head chef at Reggio's.

1:13:27.066 --> 1:13:29.233
Come on. How about it?

1:13:35.867 --> 1:13:38.934
Amy, wait.

1:13:45.467 --> 1:13:46.433
Benvenuti.

1:13:46.567 --> 1:13:48.433
Welcome to Mama's.

1:13:48.567 --> 1:13:51.133
I hope you enjoy your
experience here tonight.

1:13:51.266 --> 1:13:52.600
Take a trip down
memory lane with us,

1:13:52.734 --> 1:13:54.967
but keep an open mind, because
we have some new treats

1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:56.100
for you, as well.

1:13:56.233 --> 1:13:57.834
Okay, come on in.

1:14:02.033 --> 1:14:03.166
Hey, welcome. Welcome back.

1:14:03.300 --> 1:14:04.266
Come on in.

1:14:06.033 --> 1:14:07.667
One for you.

1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:10.333
And the wine list
is on the back.

1:14:10.467 --> 1:14:11.734
I gotta tell ya,

1:14:11.867 --> 1:14:12.900
there's something
different about you lately.

1:14:13.033 --> 1:14:14.667
I feel revitalized, Sal.

1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:15.900
I do.
- Yeah.

1:14:16.033 --> 1:14:17.533
Finally took the
time to slow down

1:14:17.667 --> 1:14:20.000
and reconnect with what
I'm doing, you know?

1:14:20.133 --> 1:14:21.200
Try this, try this.
- Nice.

1:14:21.333 --> 1:14:22.500
Okay.
- What do you think?

1:14:24.700 --> 1:14:25.834
That's delicious.

1:14:25.967 --> 1:14:27.000
You are back, baby.

1:14:27.133 --> 1:14:28.100
I'm back, baby.

1:14:29.633 --> 1:14:31.133
It's too bad being back
actually means you're leaving,

1:14:31.266 --> 1:14:32.166
but, eh.

1:14:32.300 --> 1:14:33.166
Aw, come on.

1:14:33.300 --> 1:14:34.166
Don't, don't do that.

1:14:34.300 --> 1:14:35.667
Oh, how I'll
miss you constantly

1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:36.900
shovin' down your emotions, huh?

1:14:37.033 --> 1:14:38.433
It's not like we won't
be friends anymore, Sal.

1:14:38.567 --> 1:14:39.500
I know.

1:14:39.633 --> 1:14:41.533
I'm being dramatic.

1:14:41.667 --> 1:14:43.166
Have you had a chance
to talk to Amy yet?

1:14:43.300 --> 1:14:44.166
What do you think?

1:14:44.300 --> 1:14:45.166
I think you should
tell her how you feel.

1:14:45.300 --> 1:14:46.166
I meant the-

1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:47.500
I know you meant the branzino.

1:14:47.633 --> 1:14:48.500
But you're leaving.

1:14:48.633 --> 1:14:49.700
What have you got to lose?

1:14:49.834 --> 1:14:50.967
Wasn't Mama all
about taking risks?

around since the soft open.

I am proud of you, you know?

Well.

So Sal will step in

make a reservation.

1:17:05.166 --> 1:17:06.433
It was Mama's favorite wine.

1:17:06.567 --> 1:17:09.533
It wasn't because of the flavor

1:17:09.667 --> 1:17:12.533
or the steep price tag,
even though she did

1:17:12.667 --> 1:17:14.600
have champagne tastes, oh yes.

1:17:16.333 --> 1:17:17.367
It was her favorite

1:17:19.033 --> 1:17:21.266
because she shared it with Papa.

1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:22.533

1:18:59.133 --> 1:19:00.166

Oh, hey.

1:19:10.166 --> 1:19:11.834
I thought you left
without saying goodbye.

1:19:13.033 --> 1:19:15.834
Is, uh, is Amy still here?

1:19:15.967 --> 1:19:16.834
She's in her office.

1:19:16.967 --> 1:19:18.000
Thanks.

1:19:35.700 --> 1:19:37.567
Hey, would you do me a favor?

1:19:37.700 --> 1:19:38.667
Sure.

1:19:41.367 --> 1:19:43.400
I can't, I can't find it.

1:19:43.533 --> 1:19:45.400
I lost Mama's cookbook.

1:19:45.533 --> 1:19:46.900
I have a feeling
it will turn up.

1:19:47.033 --> 1:19:49.400
No, but how could I lose it?

1:19:49.533 --> 1:19:50.900
Hey.

1:19:51.033 --> 1:19:53.300
I think there's someone
who wants to see you.

1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:08.000
Amy, getting to know you

1:20:08.133 --> 1:20:09.600
has made me realize somethin'.

1:20:11.166 --> 1:20:14.066
Mama made the right choice in
leaving you the restaurant.

1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:15.934
I also realized somethin' else.

1:20:17.133 --> 1:20:18.700
Please meet me where
the room has no walls,

1:20:18.834 --> 1:20:20.166
where the ceiling breaks,

1:20:20.300 --> 1:20:22.266
and only the sky is above us.

1:20:40.967 --> 1:20:42.333
I thought you might wanna
celebrate a great evening

1:20:42.467 --> 1:20:44.033
with a little dessert.

1:20:44.166 --> 1:20:45.200
When did you do all this?

1:20:45.333 --> 1:20:46.834
I snuck away in my down time.

1:20:47.867 --> 1:20:52.500
Picked up a few tips from Papa.

1:20:52.633 --> 1:20:54.867
Your famous tiramisu.

1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:56.166
The one and only.

1:20:57.800 --> 1:20:58.900
Of course I could order
you some chocolate pudding

1:20:59.033 --> 1:21:00.667
off the kid's menu
instead, if you like.

1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:04.967
It's perfect.

1:21:05.100 --> 1:21:06.266
Dining room looks
a little messy

1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:08.233
with my pinball
machine in there.

1:21:08.367 --> 1:21:11.400

was how much you helped me.

trying to run from it,

1:22:07.467 --> 1:22:09.033

I can be bold sometimes, too.

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.700
I changed my mind.

1:22:37.834 --> 1:22:40.533
I decided to turn down the job.

1:22:40.667 --> 1:22:41.967
You did?

1:22:42.100 --> 1:22:43.467
It was risky.

1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:47.800
Could've been the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1:22:47.934 --> 1:22:51.133
But then I realized
I already had that.

1:22:53.433 --> 1:22:56.867

so what do you say we pick
