00:14.446 --> 00:15.615
- I'm still crippled.

00:15.647 --> 00:17.317
- They actually said

00:15.647 --> 00:17.317
the ingrown toenail

00:17.350 --> 00:19.853

00:17.350 --> 00:19.853

of inside his toe--

00:24.457 --> 00:26.158
I mean, it was that big.

00:38.838 --> 00:41.140
it's gangrene.

Grayson, don't worry about that

00:44.377 --> 00:45.779

they would only

00:45.811 --> 00:47.313
take it off from the knee cap.

04:41.514 --> 04:42.949
I mean, like,

04:44.683 --> 04:46.752

04:44.683 --> 04:46.752
- No, we're not getting that.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.673
- I'm not saying nothing else.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.975
- Mama, tell me

11:13.706 --> 11:15.975
what's going on.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.779
- I don't have

11:16.759 --> 11:18.779
to tell you nothing.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.679
- Do you want to go

11:18.110 --> 11:20.679
to an assisted living?

11:20.713 --> 11:22.716
- Listen, Todd, damn it.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.517
You know, it's a secret.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.820
- Every secret that

11:24.551 --> 11:26.820
you've ever had, you've told.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.121
Don't start now holding back.

11:29.154 --> 11:32.759
Tell it or die.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.928
- Well, Allison's giving Jay

11:32.792 --> 11:35.928
a big birthday party.

11:35.961 --> 11:38.898
- She's giving Jay a party,

11:35.961 --> 11:38.898
and she didn't come to me?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.600
- Well, hell,

11:38.932 --> 11:40.600
she didn't want you

11:40.633 --> 11:42.434
because you'd take over.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.770
And that's why they didn't

11:42.469 --> 11:44.770
want me telling me nobody.

11:44.803 --> 11:46.405
- Who's "they?"

11:46.438 --> 11:48.799
- Well, I'm gonna

11:46.438 --> 11:48.799
tell you this

11:48.107 --> 11:49.576
and you better keep it

11:48.107 --> 11:49.576
between your teeth.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.644
- I would never tell

11:49.609 --> 11:51.644
anything you say.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.645
- Julie is.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.481
- Julie's helping

11:53.679 --> 11:55.481
Allison with Jay's party?

11:55.514 --> 11:57.750
- Mm-hmm.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.686
- I'm surrounded

11:57.783 --> 11:59.686
by Benedict Arnolds.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.854
First, it's my wife,

12:00.886 --> 12:02.355
then my best friend's wife,

12:02.389 --> 12:03.856
and now you, Shady Sheila.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.658
- Well, listen,

12:03.889 --> 12:05.658
I'd rather be

12:05.692 --> 12:07.961
a Benedict Arnold any day

12:05.692 --> 12:07.961
than be a rat.

12:08.610 --> 12:09.928
So don't blow up my spot

12:09.962 --> 12:12.264
with Julie and Allison.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.966

12:14.669 --> 12:15.168
Mama, it's fine.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.802
Your secret's safe with me

12:16.836 --> 12:18.270
because I have a better way

12:16.836 --> 12:18.270
of dealing with

12:18.303 --> 12:19.972
those mean girls, anyway.

12:20.730 --> 12:21.508
- Okay, well, keep me out.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.309
- Because I'm the biggest bitch

12:21.541 --> 12:24.309
in the class.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.413
- Todd.

- Nobody.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.504
- Who?

12:49.302 --> 12:51.504
- So, which girl is it, Gray?

12:51.538 --> 12:52.806
- It's not just one.

12:52.838 --> 12:54.139
- 'Cause he's got--

Two or three of 'em

12:57.210 --> 12:58.278
- Yes, he does.

- What makes you think

12:58.311 --> 13:00.513
that's okay?

13:00.547 --> 13:01.748
- Well, it's clearly not okay

13:01.780 --> 13:03.549
because they're starting

13:01.780 --> 13:03.549
to figure each other out.

13:03.582 --> 13:04.650
- Grayson!

13:04.683 --> 13:06.452
- I thought

13:04.683 --> 13:06.452
we were just texting,

13:06.485 --> 13:07.886
but I guess they wanted more.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.322
They're all saying

13:07.921 --> 13:09.322
I played 'em.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.796
three angry chicks.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.864
- Chase, you're the one

13:16.830 --> 13:17.864
that told me

13:17.897 --> 13:19.990
to leave my options open.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.634
- I didn't tell you

13:19.131 --> 13:21.634
to take every option.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.602
- It's confusing.

13:23.635 --> 13:25.404
I didn't mean to lead 'em on

13:23.635 --> 13:25.404
or anything.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.840
I feel terrible.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.774
- Man, oh, man,

13:26.873 --> 13:28.774
that is a rookie move.

- Why would you take

13:33.746 --> 13:37.317
dating advice from Chase?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.485
- Jeez.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.653
- You have to treat girls

13:38.518 --> 13:40.653
with respect.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.389
You probably should've

13:40.687 --> 13:42.389

like, about each other.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.259
Best advice I can give you

13:46.292 --> 13:48.628

13:46.292 --> 13:48.628
- 100%.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.363
you had it in you

to pull it off.

that you're trying to take Jay

14:31.705 --> 14:33.807
on an overnight fishing trip.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.750

- But I already have

14:35.750 --> 14:36.909
dinner reservations

14:36.942 --> 14:38.912
for Jay's birthday.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.912
You know that.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.447

14:40.480 --> 14:42.548
- I know, but, Allison,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.548
I mean, my best friend deserves

14:42.581 --> 14:44.850
something bigger than just,

14:42.581 --> 14:44.850
like, a small dinner.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.686
- I need him to be here though.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.554
- I mean, it's easier

14:46.720 --> 14:48.554
to change your reservation

14:48.587 --> 14:52.158
than it is for us

You're doing a party for Jay,

15:27.259 --> 15:29.828

15:27.259 --> 15:29.828
his 50th birthday party,

15:29.863 --> 15:31.865
I should be made aware of it,

15:29.863 --> 15:31.865
but instead,

15:31.898 --> 15:34.669
you went behind my back

15:31.898 --> 15:34.669

that y'all would

but I mean,

15:39.838 --> 15:41.908

You always wanna

take it too far,

15:44.110 --> 15:46.879
and Allison just wants

15:44.110 --> 15:46.879
to keep it small and intimate.

- This so terrible.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.350
Why are you doing this to me?

16:09.350 --> 16:11.437
- Because I wanted to see you

16:09.350 --> 16:11.437
squirm a little bit.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.707
But also, the fishing trip

16:11.471 --> 16:14.707
was just a ploy

16:14.740 --> 16:16.375
to make Jay think

16:14.740 --> 16:16.375
he was going out of town

16:16.408 --> 16:17.677

16:37.129 --> 16:38.831
- Todd has style.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.667
He has class, compassion--

16:40.700 --> 16:42.434
- Yes, okay, we get it.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.434
We get it.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.903
- You're just sitting around

16:42.469 --> 16:43.903
fishing for compliments.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.270
[laughter]

16:45.304 --> 16:46.972
- Well, that might be the case.

16:47.730 --> 16:49.241
- [laughs]

16:49.274 --> 16:52.211
<i>[bright classical music]</i>

16:52.245 --> 16:53.812
- You seem quiet.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.812
- I guess I'm just

16:53.846 --> 16:55.809
kind of, like,

16:53.846 --> 16:55.809
in a funk right now.

16:55.809 --> 16:56.982
- Food, shopping--

16:57.830 --> 16:59.552
it definitely cures

16:57.830 --> 16:59.552
all of our issues.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.210
Like, I was sad yesterday.

17:01.539 --> 17:02.755
I went and bought

17:01.539 --> 17:02.755
these new shoes.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.656
- Savannah,

17:02.788 --> 17:04.656
I go for, like, a walk.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.759
Like normal people.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.259
- Well, I do go for a walk.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.795
Just from store to store.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.630
- [snorts]

17:10.663 --> 17:12.464
- Thank y'all.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.464
- You're welcome.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.680
- Hey, y'all.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.680
- Hi.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.670
- Well, look at you, Grayson.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.538
- Savannah,

17:16.702 --> 17:18.538
you look beautiful today.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.339
- Well, thank you.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.941
I mean, I really

17:20.373 --> 17:21.941
didn't even realize

17:22.420 --> 17:24.210
that you were coming in

17:22.420 --> 17:24.210
because for once,

17:24.243 --> 17:28.480
I didn't smell you

17:24.243 --> 17:28.480
before I saw you.

17:28.809 --> 17:30.683
- Yeah, he's toned it down

17:28.809 --> 17:30.683
a little bit, which is nice.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.251
- I wanna know

17:30.717 --> 17:32.251
how you ended up

17:32.285 --> 17:34.319
kinda getting out of this

17:34.354 --> 17:36.455
whole situation

17:34.354 --> 17:36.455
you got yourself into.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.590
- I was just honest with them

17:36.489 --> 17:38.590
and told them everything

17:38.625 --> 17:40.226
that was going on,

17:38.625 --> 17:40.226
and it worked out.

17:40.259 --> 17:41.827
- So you took my advice?

17:41.861 --> 17:44.730
- Talking to a couple of girls

17:41.861 --> 17:44.730
was just overwhelming.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.099
- Coming clean, being honest

17:44.763 --> 17:47.099
is the best policy.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.269
- You see, if that was me,

17:47.133 --> 17:49.269
back in the day,

17:49.301 --> 17:51.938
I wouldn't have made it out

17:49.301 --> 17:51.938
without, like, a stab wound.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.138
<i>- You know what, Chase,</i>

17:51.971 --> 17:53.138
<i>I don't know</i>

17:53.173 --> 17:54.374
if this player lifestyle

17:53.173 --> 17:54.374
is for me.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.343
It's stressful.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.343
- I understand that.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.676
But you know what?

17:56.375 --> 17:57.676
It's okay to...

17:57.711 --> 17:59.645
flirt on the dark side

17:57.711 --> 17:59.645
every now and then.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.816
- Yeah, I'll leave that

17:59.679 --> 18:02.816
for you to do.

18:02.848 --> 18:05.551
- So does this mean we're back

18:02.848 --> 18:05.551
to doing game nights on Monday?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.119
- Actually,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.119
I got a date on Monday,

18:07.153 --> 18:08.320
but it's--it's one girl.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.390
- Once a player,

18:08.355 --> 18:10.390
always a player.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.592
- No.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.592
[laughter]

18:12.625 --> 18:15.260
- Oh, my God.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.260

- Say,

18:30.410 --> 18:31.944
"I like playing the field."

- I like playing the field.

Chase, I don't need you

influencing this child.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.720

All right, they're pulling up.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.248
I did all of this,

19:08.280 --> 19:09.682
and Todd added this.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.818
- Yes.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.818
- Of course he did.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.887
- I'll admit, I was hurt

19:14.921 --> 19:17.123
when y'all excluded me

19:14.921 --> 19:17.123
from the party planning.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.358
But now I realize

19:17.156 --> 19:19.358
that I was meant

19:19.392 --> 19:21.461

freaking fishing?

19:31.203 --> 19:33.105
- We are going fishing.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.441
I bought all the gear.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.675
I bought all the clothing,

- A suitcase?

20:21.210 --> 20:23.256
- For fishermen.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.910
- I think it's called

20:23.288 --> 20:25.910
a tackle box.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.393
- That's what it is.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.993
- Well, it does coordinate

20:26.425 --> 20:27.993
nicely with your outfit.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.267
- No, y'all look like twinsies.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.494

21:02.528 --> 21:04.297
- Yeah.
