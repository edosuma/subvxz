02:26.520 --> 02:27.475
Who is that?

02:31.400 --> 02:35.029
That child! We won't have
any fruit left.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.558
Auntie.

05:00.240 --> 05:05.792
The orchard is private property,
bought and paid for.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.039
It will have to be fenced in
if we're to save any fruit.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.549
There are so many thieves about.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.156
That wretched girl of Hori's.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.358
She's always taking our fruit.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.717
You have to keep
your eyes peeled for her.

05:26.840 --> 05:32.358
I just saw her taking a guava
and who knows what else?

05:32.560 --> 05:35.552
- Tell her off.
- What's the use?

05:37.840 --> 05:42.436
She'll take no notice of me,
she's not my daughter.

05:42.640 --> 05:47.156
It doesn't matter what we say,
it's up to her mother.

05:47.920 --> 05:52.550
The mother will be shocked when
she's shamed before the village.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.357
That child is being badly brought up.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.550
Can I help?

06:04.840 --> 06:08.628
- It's too heavy for you.
- I can manage.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.073
Did I forget you, Durga? Wait.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.953
Come here.

07:29.160 --> 07:32.550
She's doing no harm, let her stay.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.559
Why should she watch you eat?

07:36.240 --> 07:40.791
Run along to your mother, dear.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.115
Did you take something
from Mrs. Mukherji's garden?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.557
What are you hiding?

08:05.160 --> 08:07.549
Take them back to her.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.038
Then come back and sweep the yard.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.908
You're spoiling Durga.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.989
- I don't understand.
- You do.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.919
You eat the fruit.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.320
The fruit Durga brings you.

09:15.240 --> 09:19.711
You should know better,
shouldn't you?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.879
You think you can do as you please,
living with us.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.548
- I know you.
- What do you mean?

09:31.840 --> 09:36.118
You know. Don't you take things
from the kitchen?

09:36.600 --> 09:38.352
Oil, salt, chillies.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.110
Shall I look in your box?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.556
Lost your tongue?

09:45.240 --> 09:50.189
It's got to stop.
Maybe you'd better go somewhere else

09:53.440 --> 09:58.958
I've stood it for eight years,
my patience is exhausted.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.912
You spoil my daughter
and I get the blame for it.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.558
It's too much in my old age.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.791
Where are you going?

11:13.960 --> 11:14.790
Auntie.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.789
Leave her alone, Durga.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.556
Did you hear me?

11:54.520 --> 11:57.114
What else did I tell you to do?

13:46.480 --> 13:51.110
- Where have you been, Auntie Indir?
- I was staying with Raghu.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.677
Then this morning
I heard that Hori has...

13:56.000 --> 14:00.039
On my way I found this child
coming to fetch me.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.875
So we met.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.709
Go and see your lovely new nephew.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.028
Let me see his face properly.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.558
What a little darling.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.636
What are you cooking?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.750
Pilau, korma... fine dishes.

15:35.080 --> 15:38.959
One day you shall cook them,
or have you forgotten how?

15:39.160 --> 15:41.071
I've forgotten.

15:41.320 --> 15:46.713
A pity, I thought we might
celebrate our son's birth.

15:49.600 --> 15:54.355
- What about money?
- I shall start work next month.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.359
Landlord Ray has promised a job,
doing his accounts.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.556
Did you ask about pay?

16:02.760 --> 16:06.719
No, but I shan't slave
as a rent collector for ever.

16:06.920 --> 16:12.552
The money from that job and the fees
for religious ceremonies...

16:12.760 --> 16:17.356
...will keep the family going for now.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.194
Surely you can understand that.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.517
Lucky January: the boy was born
and you got a job.

16:28.760 --> 16:32.355
That's why I think we should
spend a little...

16:32.600 --> 16:36.036
...and celebrate his birth in style.

16:37.600 --> 16:44.039
It's good for our prestige, and
people will praise your cooking.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.836
- Will you be paid regularly?
- Why not? Ray is a good man.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.959
You're no judge of that,
you've always been cheated.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.037
What do you mean?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.875
What about our garden?

17:04.599 --> 17:08.957
They said my brother owed them
money when he was alive.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.070
The garden paid off the debt.

17:11.760 --> 17:17.710
If we had the orchard now
we wouldn't go hungry.

17:17.920 --> 17:23.836
You should hear what they say
when Durga takes a few guavas.

17:24.599 --> 17:28.718
What do such people matter?
I am a scholar.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.798
Who cares about that here?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.992
Listen to what I have in mind.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.877
I am going to write original plays
and poems.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.719
I'll soon be in great demand.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.516
The travelling players need
new material.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.230
Most writers are merely
rehashing old stories.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.398
If their stuff is popular...

17:56.000 --> 17:59.549
...shouldn't my stuff be
even more popular?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.718
Of course.

18:02.320 --> 18:07.314
And as a scholar you'll be
respected in the village.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.756
And you will teach the boy.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.994
It's not long to the festival.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.873
A good match will be found for Durga.

18:23.160 --> 18:28.359
We'll have two good meals a day
and new clothes twice a year.

18:29.160 --> 18:34.871
That's how it will be, my ancestors
were writers, after all.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.198
I keep alive the family tradition.

18:38.400 --> 18:44.350
In two years we'll be living
in comfort, free of debt.

18:44.600 --> 18:48.639
The house will be repaired...
and no more spinach every day.

19:23.840 --> 19:29.358
Wake up, Apu, it's time to go
to school.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.399
Durga, wake Apu

19:40.600 --> 19:43.558
I can't make him stir.

19:47.600 --> 19:53.596
There's not much milk, do you
feed the cow properly?

21:51.160 --> 21:55.995
How many more times must you
moisten your duster?

21:57.360 --> 21:58.839
Sit down!

22:04.920 --> 22:08.879
- What do you want?
- Puffed rice, please.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.753
Hand over the money, then.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.869
You've netted a fine catch.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.868
How many pupils now?

23:17.080 --> 23:20.959
The new boy makes nine.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.958
The nine gems.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.832
What are you laughing at?

23:29.920 --> 23:33.629
Go on like that and you'll
end up behind a plough.

23:35.160 --> 23:40.029
- You were saying, sir?
- Have you seen any good plays?

23:40.240 --> 23:44.028
I did see one company.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.037
Gupe, what are you doing?

23:47.760 --> 23:53.392
The next village has booked
a very good company

23:53.600 --> 23:54.749
I'll thrash you.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.350
They thought they'd be one up on us,

23:58.560 --> 24:02.348
but they reckoned without me

24:02.600 --> 24:08.357
I've booked the finest company
anyone's ever seen.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.114
May I have some of your oil?

24:14.600 --> 24:18.639
I've not put you down for
a contribution...

24:18.840 --> 24:21.752
...but I'm sure you won't forget
my needs.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.358
Don't forget your friend Boidyonath.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.716
Wait, Mr. Chakrabarti.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.874
The drummer...

24:36.080 --> 24:38.389
...of the company...

24:38.600 --> 24:40.556
...sounds like thunder.

24:49.600 --> 24:54.549
Sude, come here and bring
your slate with you.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.796
Bring me his slate.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.359
So this is what you've been up to.

25:18.840 --> 25:22.037
Hold out your hand.

25:59.320 --> 26:03.552
What are you doing?

26:07.400 --> 26:10.949
- What are you doing in the kitchen?
- Nothing.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.550
Nothing? Didn't I see you take
something?

26:14.840 --> 26:18.389
I have no chillies, so I thought
I'd take a couple.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.352
Why didn't you ask?

26:46.600 --> 26:50.149
Durga, come and help me
when you are free.

27:02.160 --> 27:08.030
Girls of your age should help about
the house, cooking, washing up...

27:09.560 --> 27:13.030
...performing religious rites.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.433
Is it right to skylark about all day?

27:20.760 --> 27:23.558
You must learn to cook, mustn't you?

27:37.160 --> 27:40.550
Are you feverish again today?

27:43.320 --> 27:45.550
Remember to drink
your herbal tincture.

28:04.600 --> 28:09.674
- I'm hungry.
- Haven't you had your puffed rice?

28:15.360 --> 28:19.069
There is rice for you in the bowl
ask Durga to give you some.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.758
Help me up.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.196
My back is stiff.

28:37.400 --> 28:42.872
- How are you these days?
- Who cares about an old woman?

28:43.920 --> 28:45.990
Just look at this.

28:51.520 --> 28:58.232
- It's my shawl for the evenings.
- I'll buy you a new one soon.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.309
Can I have a light?

29:13.960 --> 29:18.351
We can't afford so much tobacco.

29:29.160 --> 29:32.789
Did you ask for your pay today?

29:33.000 --> 29:39.553
Landlord Ray has his own troubles.
I might risk my job if I ask now.

29:39.760 --> 29:44.550
There must be other jobs
in the town.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.718
You haven't been paid
for three months.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.478
It's the first time.

29:49.680 --> 29:55.357
You're happy to let things slide.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.796
Durga has not been well,
she needs medicine and better food.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.798
Apu needs new clothes,
he's going to school in rags.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.958
The house needs repairing,
debts must be repaid.

30:21.160 --> 30:26.553
We owe Mrs. Mukherji five rupees,
she'll press for repayment.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.477
You must do something.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.116
You won't tell mother?

30:54.720 --> 30:56.278
She'll hear you.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.235
The sweet-seller.

31:44.760 --> 31:50.198
Halva, fudge, coconut cakes.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.674
Ask father for money.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.555
You ask.

32:16.280 --> 32:20.876
Is he asking for money?
Don't pander to him.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.595
None today?

32:30.760 --> 32:32.990
Let's follow him to the others.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.795
Let me see what you've got.

34:12.120 --> 34:15.795
Coming to play with us, Durga?

34:16.800 --> 34:21.635
Coming? If not, go home,
I'll be back soon.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.795
Like a sweet, Durga?

34:35.000 --> 34:41.553
Don't give them any. If they want
sweets, they should buy their own.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.550
Tunu, come and play.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.918
What lovely beads.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.875
- Who gave them to you?
- Father.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.478
Let me help you.

36:54.520 --> 37:00.470
What have things come to, when an
old woman has to patch her shawl?

37:01.680 --> 37:03.477
Durga, come here.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.988
You know it's time to do your hair.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.789
- Can you plait four strands?
- Don't move your head.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.558
Ranu can.

37:46.920 --> 37:53.109
What dry hair, and we have no oil.
Never mind four-stranded plaits.

37:55.520 --> 37:59.479
Some people are coming to see
if Ranu is a suitable bride.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.468
Who are they?

38:36.200 --> 38:37.349
Ever seen a train?

38:38.520 --> 38:39.669
Don't lie.

38:39.880 --> 38:43.555
Do you know
where the railway line is?

38:44.000 --> 38:47.959
Over the big meadow,
beyond the rice fields.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.879
Let's go there.

38:58.520 --> 39:03.116
Now write the word... wealth.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.070
Were you good at school?

39:54.320 --> 39:59.713
You're so tiny, do the other boys
tease you?

40:34.760 --> 40:37.877
I'm not surprised he's left it.

40:39.840 --> 40:45.790
He gets nothing but rice,
but what else can I afford?

40:48.720 --> 40:50.312
Wash your face.

40:57.800 --> 40:58.755
Where's Durga?

41:00.760 --> 41:03.069
Shall I fetch her toy-box?

41:05.320 --> 41:07.880
She's not well brought up.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.593
What has happened?

41:10.800 --> 41:13.758
Durga has stolen Tunu's beads.

41:20.080 --> 41:24.119
Don't look astonished, she is
an accomplished thief.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.720
Her father bought the beads in town.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.673
Tunu showed Durga.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.875
This morning the beads had vanished.

41:46.000 --> 41:51.438
Durga hasn't been back, anyway,
are you sure she took them?

41:53.520 --> 41:56.080
Are you suggesting we've invented it?

41:56.560 --> 42:00.314
- The string could have broken.
- It didn't.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.956
We've searched everywhere.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.715
Did you take Tunu's beads?

42:19.360 --> 42:20.918
Didn't you?

42:22.520 --> 42:24.476
She's a liar.

42:26.080 --> 42:29.470
Where do you suppose she got
that fruit?

42:38.520 --> 42:42.354
What's the matter? What's going on?

43:06.520 --> 43:11.958
The garden isn't ours,
it's wrong to take the fruit.

43:12.160 --> 43:17.280
But how can you accuse her of
stealing something bought for money?

43:17.600 --> 43:20.592
She's a child.
Fruit has no name on it.

43:21.080 --> 43:24.959
Listen to that! The rupees I lent you
had no name on...

43:25.160 --> 43:26.718
...had they?

43:27.240 --> 43:31.472
When will you pay them back?
I can't wait forever.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.876
When you find the beads
I hope you'll return them.

43:46.840 --> 43:53.109
Our fruit disappears. I complain
and the mother says:

43:53.320 --> 43:57.871
Suppose the children take it,
fruit has no name on it.

43:58.080 --> 44:02.039
Like mother, like daughter:
a pair of thieves.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.355
Come here.

46:29.240 --> 46:32.118
Tell Durga to come in for her meal.

46:51.320 --> 46:55.871
Then came an ogress,
hobble, cackle, gobble.

46:56.520 --> 47:03.039
"I smell humans!
Who is awake in my temple?"

47:04.320 --> 47:08.871
Iue Lotus Prince kept guard
while Red Lotus Prince slept.

47:10.400 --> 47:15.110
And at midnight the ogress
came once more.

47:15.520 --> 47:18.353
Hobble, cackle, gobble.

47:18.600 --> 47:22.878
"Who is awake in my temple?"

47:24.480 --> 47:26.072
Father's home.

47:29.920 --> 47:32.480
Give mother the fish.

47:39.280 --> 47:40.474
Put it down.

47:49.720 --> 47:52.553
Come here, I have lots to tell you.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.195
No matter what people say...

48:17.760 --> 48:20.035
...landlord Ray is a good man.

48:26.520 --> 48:29.478
My three months' wages.

48:29.680 --> 48:33.958
First I will say evening prayers,
then I have much to tell you.

48:49.600 --> 48:55.470
Today I met a rich farmer.
I don't know him...

48:56.160 --> 49:02.474
...but he greeted me
and said my father knew him.

49:03.920 --> 49:09.870
He said my father officiated
as a priest in his household.

49:10.240 --> 49:15.030
Now he wants me to perform
the same duties.

49:15.840 --> 49:20.072
They're having a religious
ceremony next month.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.430
He wants me to baptise them.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.596
- They are rich.
- Have you agreed?

49:29.520 --> 49:34.036
If I agree straight away,
they'll think we are starving.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.629
Accept at once.

49:36.840 --> 49:42.278
The trouble is that some people
will criticize if they know.

49:42.520 --> 49:43.475
Who will know?

49:44.520 --> 49:47.956
You might talk, you know
what women are like

49:48.840 --> 49:51.912
I have better things to do
with my time.

49:52.920 --> 49:56.959
Don't be upset. The client
won't run away.

49:57.760 --> 50:02.038
I mustn't seem over-eager, he can
wait until after the festival.

50:02.520 --> 50:05.273
We'll manage on my wages until then.

50:05.480 --> 50:09.314
The children need new clothes
and Auntie needs a shawl.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.671
We owe Mrs. Mukherji five rupees.

50:11.880 --> 50:15.998
We'll have to pay all that
out of the wages.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.673
And the repairs?

50:19.880 --> 50:23.111
We have survived the monsoon.

50:23.320 --> 50:27.108
The repairs must wait,
but I'll get estimates.

50:27.320 --> 50:30.278
Something must be done to the kitchen.

50:30.520 --> 50:37.119
Don't worry. Kitchen, walls, roof,
everything will be done.

50:42.920 --> 50:45.115
How many days to the festival?

50:47.520 --> 50:48.475
Twenty-one.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.034
Did you take Tunu's beads?

51:11.680 --> 51:14.513
- Do you know who did?
- No. Go to sleep

51:16.760 --> 51:19.957
I have another idea for a play.

51:20.160 --> 51:24.950
I might be able to write it in a week.

51:37.240 --> 51:42.473
You once lived in Benares,
did you have friends there?

51:42.680 --> 51:45.877
I had a few.

51:47.160 --> 51:50.197
Isn't there a place by the river...

51:50.400 --> 51:53.710
...where men recite from
the scriptures?

51:54.680 --> 51:58.355
It's called Dasasvamedh Ghat.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.956
Let's go to Benares.

52:02.560 --> 52:05.028
Don't the orators earn lots of money?

52:05.240 --> 52:09.279
We can't go. How can we?

52:10.240 --> 52:15.951
This is my ancestral home,
how can I leave it?

52:16.680 --> 52:20.275
Why not? You were away
eight years before.

52:20.480 --> 52:23.472
You left me at my father's
and never wrote.

52:23.680 --> 52:27.958
Then I did not know how sweet you are.

52:28.160 --> 52:29.718
Save your compliments.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.751
This is my home, too.

52:36.320 --> 52:40.279
But look at it: it's like
living in the forest.

52:41.760 --> 52:45.469
At night the jackals prowl around.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.039
There are no neighbours
I can talk to.

52:52.160 --> 52:57.712
You are not always here
and sometimes I'm so depressed.

53:00.240 --> 53:02.470
You won't understand these things.

53:03.680 --> 53:08.879
You live in your work. Sometimes
you're paid, sometimes not

53:12.320 --> 53:17.269
I had dreams, too, of all the things
I would do.

53:21.880 --> 53:25.714
Those who came before are gone.

53:25.920 --> 53:29.469
I am left behind,
a penniless beggar.

53:30.080 --> 53:35.473
Day draws to its close,
night's mantle descends.

53:35.680 --> 53:41.198
Row me across to the other side.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.118
Hurry with the twigs, this wood
is too damp to light.

54:48.520 --> 54:53.469
A new shawl, Auntie? How nice.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.040
What a lovely shawl, Auntie.

55:23.520 --> 55:29.470
Raju gave it to me, to keep me
warm in the evenings.

55:39.080 --> 55:42.516
We're having a picnic,
please cook something.

55:59.320 --> 56:02.471
Why is it never her turn
to go and fetch things?

56:52.160 --> 56:54.037
What's the matter?

57:01.160 --> 57:02.275
What's that shawl?

57:04.760 --> 57:08.833
It's a present from Raju.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.470
A present, was it?

57:14.160 --> 57:15.115
You didn't ask?

57:15.680 --> 57:16.749
Why should I?

57:18.480 --> 57:22.951
I just remarked that the evenings
were chilly, so he said...

57:23.160 --> 57:25.310
Would he feed you, too?

57:25.840 --> 57:30.470
Don't be angry. I did ask Hori
for a shawl.

57:31.760 --> 57:35.878
And as he couldn't give it to you
at once, you went begging.

57:36.520 --> 57:38.636
You should be ashamed.

57:38.840 --> 57:40.831
Can't an old woman have whims?

57:41.760 --> 57:43.239
Whims?

57:43.440 --> 57:48.116
Don't you realize that the children
often go hungry?

57:48.320 --> 57:53.474
Are you going to dress and feed them?

57:54.280 --> 57:59.115
If you're staying here, stop begging,
otherwise, go away.

58:00.520 --> 58:04.593
I can always find
somewhere else to go.

58:05.760 --> 58:08.479
Fine! Take yourself off.

58:43.520 --> 58:47.479
You'd better go, you can't
stay here any longer.

58:53.520 --> 58:58.196
It's lovely, your husband
will enjoy your cooking.

59:02.520 --> 59:05.557
- When is the wedding?
- I've forgotten.

59:05.760 --> 59:07.478
I know when.

59:08.920 --> 59:12.469
It's in two months, isn't it?

59:14.320 --> 59:17.630
- What does it feel like?
- Much the same.

59:17.840 --> 59:20.638
- Tell me.
- You'll find out.

59:20.840 --> 59:25.277
It won't happen to me,
I just know it won't.

59:25.680 --> 59:31.277
Your mother is arranging a match,
just wait and see.

59:51.520 --> 59:56.116
Raju, are you at home?

59:56.480 --> 59:59.870
- Who is it?
- Your old auntie.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.269
I wonder whether you can take me in,
just for a few days?

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.470
Only a few days.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.470
I get no peace at the other place,
nothing but nagging.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.468
Come in.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.469
Tell your mother that Auntie
has come to stay.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.797
Bring her a chair and a bowl of water

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.870
I've nowhere to go now I'm old,
so I thought of you.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.233
Beware, King! If you utter
those words again...

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.034
...I shall cut out your tongue...

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.239
...and throw it to the jackals
and the dogs!

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.399
And I shall destroy you,
for the good of the world!

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.913
Father, do not do it, I beseech you!

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.556
Durga, go and find the calf.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.718
Please tie this on for me.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.357
Apu, let's look for Auntie.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.956
I want you to find the calf first.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.157
What's that?

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.990
Who gave you the silver paper?

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.320
- He's been at my toy-box.
- You're too old for a toy-box now.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.156
He took my silver paper.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.794
Go and find the calf.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.030
Stupid!

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.915
Dressing up as a prince.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.348
Anyone at home?

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.516
Why have you come back?

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.519
I'm not feeling very well.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.510
I'd like to spend my last days
in the old home.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:43.352
What's the old home to you?
The best thing you can do is leave.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.350
Just a minute.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.076
What are you waiting for?

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.919
Let me rest here awhile.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.153
Sister-in-law,
have you gone to sleep?

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.598
Will you give me some water?

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.758
Your bowl is there, help yourself.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.875
Sit down.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.070
Eat it.

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.353
Where are we?

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.233
What are those?

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.518
Those who came before are gone

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.117
I am left behind
Row me across to the other side.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.713
Day draws to its close,
night's mantle descends.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.438
Will you be away for long?

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.997
About a week. I'll call at
Bistupar on the way back.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:57.116
It's a good market town,
something may turn up there.

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.635
Look, there's father.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.711
Ask him for some money.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:43.270
Put the cat down and go and buy
some molasses.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:51.311
Apu wants rice pudding, he's been
asking for it for days.

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.080
A letter!

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.512
Give it to me

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.794
I arrived here yesterday.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.151
The rich farmer has lost two sons...

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:35.069
...so a ceremony
is out of the question now.

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.556
But don't worry.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:44.710
I'll try to earn money for the
repairs and then I'll return home.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.992
Do not worry.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.639
Whatever God wills is for the best
Give my love to Durga and Apu.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.878
Charity, lady.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.079
Alms, good mother.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:30.070
Bless you. One day you will be
goddess of wealth.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.236
Why didn't you tell me?

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.072
You can't go on like this,
why didn't you tell me?

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.636
After all, we're not strangers.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:45.710
Every day I hope there will be
some news.

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.395
It never comes.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:55.072
Five months now without news,
without letters.

01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:00.398
Let Durga come with me, I'll give her
something to tide you over.

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:08.239
- Don't be silly.
- I can't take it

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.148
I feel so ashamed.

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.398
A letter!

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.876
No doubt you are worried because
I have not written for months.

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.875
Anyway, I have good news:
I have been able to earn money.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:13.476
I shall be returning home soon.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.559
Whatever God wills is for the best.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:06.719
Holy Pond, Flower Garland,
who prays here at noon?

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:12.035
I, fortunate sister of my brothers.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.116
Mother Goddess, counsel me,
I know not how to pray.

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:50.073
May I live in happiness
with my husband.

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.637
Mother Goddess, grant me this boon.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:30.029
Rain, rain, go away...

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.916
Any news of Hori?

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.477
He says he will be back this month.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.191
Why is he away so long?

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.797
Have you any sago?
I can let you have some.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.749
If the fever continues to increase,
apply cold compresses.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:03.070
No cause for alarm, just see that
she doesn't get another chill.

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.079
We'll go and see the train
when I'm better, shall we?

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.033
We'll have a good look next time

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.109
Durga is worse, can you come?

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.799
Sweep the yard. I'm going
to look at Durga.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.238
Fetch my husband, say I asked him
to come.

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.072
- Is Durga asleep?
- Yes. Run along, dear.

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:40.399
Mother sends these vegetables.
I'll put them here.

01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:32.238
It would fall while I was away.
Couldn't it have waited?

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:03.072
How are you?

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.117
Are the children out?

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:40.559
Where are you going now?
I've brought some presents.

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:44.239
I'd have come earlier, if I could.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:49.231
My luck turned at Ranaghat,
at long last.

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:54.800
See what I bought in the market there
a pastry-board and rolling pin.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:03.115
A picture of Goddess Lakshmi,
which you asked me to get.

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:06.954
A new sari for Durga.

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:51.038
After this last year I have
no affection for the old home.

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:58.958
I don't know
what we would have done...

01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:05.038
...if you and your husband
hadn't helped us.

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:11.470
If we had done more,
perhaps you would have stayed.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:15.548
It's not your fault,
it's just our bad luck.

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.389
Other people live here quite happily

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.231
I hope you'll settle down
in the new place.

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:38.035
These fell in the storm, I thought
you'd like them for the journey.

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:39.713
How kind.

01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:45.711
It's only a few mangoes. I've done
nothing for you in the past.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:48.677
You're really going tomorrow?

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:53.432
Yes. Perhaps we should have
told you before.

01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:58.839
Never mind. I think that
leaving here is a good idea.

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:06.719
Everyone should make a move
once in a while.

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:13.195
Staying in one place makes you mean,
it's done that to me.

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:21.593
I'd like to go away, too,
I'll see what my husband says.

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.038
Don't put yourself out on my account

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:54.870
I've been confined to bed
for over a month...

01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.549
...so I couldn't come to see you

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:05.631
I'm told you're moving to Benares,
is that so?

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:09.879
Yes, we're leaving at dawn tomorrow.

01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.035
You're going tomorrow?

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:23.390
Think for a moment, is this
a wise decision?

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:29.229
You are Rajkestra's son,
Tarkalankar's grandson.

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.037
Your family has lived here
for generations.

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:39.435
We village elders still exist.
You could have asked our advice.

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.234
Would that have helped?

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.036
Look at the house, I haven't
the means to repair it.

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.239
Perhaps I should have asked
for your help...

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.796
...but how long could that last?

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.393
I have been saddled with debts
for fifteen years.

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:07.029
My hopes of clearing them by selling
some furniture came to nothing

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:13.195
I wanted to be a writer, now my
manuscripts are worm eaten.

01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:16.398
I hoped to educate my boy,
but it was not to be.

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:20.229
And the girl... she is at rest.

01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.751
Sometimes it is necessary
to leave the ancestral home.

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:29.679
In town I may earn a little...

01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.236
...reciting from the scriptures

01:56:34.305 --> 01:56:40.836
