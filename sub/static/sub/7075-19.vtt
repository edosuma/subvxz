WEBVTT

00:02.945 --> 00:04.883
It was my friend Abed's birthday.

00:04.897 --> 00:06.465
I had met Abed at community college

00:06.466 --> 00:07.922
almost two years earlier.

00:07.923 --> 00:09.386
His obsession with pop culture

00:09.387 --> 00:11.087
had always alienated him.

00:11.088 --> 00:13.733
He'd quote movies, pretend
his life was a TV show.

00:13.734 --> 00:15.039
He watched Cougar Town.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.476
It was as if he didn't
want people to like him.

00:17.796 --> 00:19.911
Then this year, around Christmas,

00:19.912 --> 00:21.167
he had some kind of...

00:21.168 --> 00:23.457
I don't know... mental episode,

00:23.458 --> 00:25.900
saying people were made
of clay... stuff like that.

00:26.267 --> 00:28.524
He'd seemed okay since,
but when I asked him

00:28.525 --> 00:30.304
if he'd like to do
anything for his birthday,

00:30.305 --> 00:32.619
he told me we should have
dinner, just he and I,

00:32.621 --> 00:35.097
for an important conversation.

00:35.098 --> 00:36.631
It made me nervous.

00:37.277 --> 00:39.840
The restaurant Abed had chosen
wasn't his style at all.

00:39.841 --> 00:42.177
There were cloth napkins, no TVs.

00:42.260 --> 00:44.364
Abed liked chicken fingers, video games,

00:44.365 --> 00:45.891
Quentin Tarantino.

00:47.868 --> 00:49.587
Babysitting him through a full meal

00:49.588 --> 00:51.261
at a restaurant for grown-ups...

00:51.823 --> 00:53.718
I just wasn't up for it.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.714
But I loved Abed. Everyone did.

00:56.908 --> 00:59.385
So I had come there with a
surprise plan of my own.

00:59.386 --> 01:01.725
Hey, uh, could I get a MacAllan, neat?

01:04.099 --> 01:05.331
Jeffrey!

01:07.712 --> 01:08.884
Buddy.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.162
I like your sweater.

01:14.225 --> 01:16.078
Did it come with a Golden Retriever?

01:16.788 --> 01:18.263
You look good too.

01:20.693 --> 01:23.354
I would like a, uh... spritzer.

01:23.355 --> 01:25.126
Abed was being weird.

01:25.127 --> 01:28.522
And by that, I mean he wasn't being weird.

01:28.667 --> 01:31.744
He was hugging, smiling,
making eye contact,

01:31.745 --> 01:34.986
and in 30 seconds, he hadn't
made a reference to anything.

01:35.418 --> 01:37.280
I had come in worried about him,

01:37.281 --> 01:38.964
thinking he needed help.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.984
But seeing him like this made
me more worried than ever.

01:42.018 --> 01:45.060
Get it? Like Pulp Fiction.

01:45.889 --> 01:47.522
It's a wallet that says "Bad mother..."

01:47.523 --> 01:49.202
- Your table's ready, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

01:49.203 --> 01:51.131
Actually, uh, I had an idea.

01:51.369 --> 01:53.604
I saw a very cool burger place
just a few...

01:53.605 --> 01:56.382
Nonsense.
I didn't come downtown for burgers.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.737
Come, come.

01:58.922 --> 02:00.829
Uh, I-I'll be right there.

02:07.313 --> 02:09.145
Hey, uh, we're running a little bit late...

02:09.145 --> 02:11.387
No big deal, just a small speed bump.

02:11.578 --> 02:13.420
Well, hurry up. We're waiting.

02:14.475 --> 02:16.320
Surprise!

02:16.321 --> 02:19.585
Guys, no! They're running late.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.130
That was Jeff.
He says there's some kind of speed bump.

02:24.380 --> 02:26.063
Pierce, nobody can hear you.

02:26.775 --> 02:29.347
Well, I'm hot, and my balls
are touching the zipper!

03:00.254 --> 03:02.269
Can you imagine the
expression on Abed's face

03:02.270 --> 03:03.498
when he walks in?

03:03.499 --> 03:06.167
Of course we can imagine it.
It's always the same.

03:06.168 --> 03:07.785
Yeah, but he's gonna say "cool"

03:07.786 --> 03:09.556
at least five times.

03:09.875 --> 03:12.094
It's really great of Jeff
to put this together.

03:12.095 --> 03:13.287
I'm not jealous.

03:13.288 --> 03:14.568
- Hmm? 
- Hmm?

03:15.518 --> 03:18.027
Oh, cool, someone got him a briefcase,

03:18.028 --> 03:20.214
like in the movie. What's in it?

03:20.215 --> 03:21.658
Hey, don't touch that!

03:21.659 --> 03:22.753
It's from Jeff, and he says

03:22.754 --> 03:24.709
nobody but Abed can open it.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.188
Why? What's in it?

03:28.234 --> 03:30.778
What, I have 3D vision now?

03:31.607 --> 03:34.536
- Yes, you do. 
- You don't know me!

03:34.537 --> 03:37.794
Everybody just be patient and
don't mess with anything.

03:37.795 --> 03:40.894
I am responsible for this diner
when my boss isn't around.

03:40.895 --> 03:43.077
She will not stop bragging about that.

03:43.078 --> 03:44.122
I know.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.199
Has anyone seen this
movie we're referencing?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.794
Am I the hero or the love interest?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.616
Pulp Fiction?
Yeah, I saw it on an airplane.

03:49.617 --> 03:51.246
It's cute. It's a 30-minute film

03:51.247 --> 03:52.751
about a group of friends
who like cheeseburgers,

03:52.752 --> 03:54.387
dancing, and the Bible.

03:57.469 --> 03:59.279
- Jeff's not better than me. 
- Hmm?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.958
I said, "hmm."

04:02.927 --> 04:04.920
Boy, is this menu stuffy.

04:04.921 --> 04:07.452
I don't know about you, but
I'd rather have a nice...

04:07.453 --> 04:10.111
Rillettes de saumon, to start, I think,

04:10.112 --> 04:12.100
and, ooh, squab.

04:12.101 --> 04:14.280
- Very good. 
- They don't have quail.

04:14.281 --> 04:15.894
Good to know. Salad.

04:15.895 --> 04:18.168
- Excellent choice. 
- Yeah, I nailed it.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.928
Um, you forgot this in the bar.

04:20.930 --> 04:23.145
Ah, so I did. I'm sorry.

04:23.146 --> 04:25.002
What a thoughtful gift, Jeff.

04:25.554 --> 04:27.668
I really was a man of singular taste.

04:27.669 --> 04:29.585
Was? Abed, what's going on?

04:29.586 --> 04:30.854
Why are you dressed like Mr. Rogers

04:30.855 --> 04:32.844
and talking like Frasier?
What happened to you?

04:32.845 --> 04:34.143
Oh, where to begin.

04:34.144 --> 04:36.072
I probably mentioned in
the past my fondness

04:36.073 --> 04:37.772
for a TV program called Cougar Town.

04:37.773 --> 04:38.839
Here and there.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.197
I even started a Cougar Town fan club

04:40.198 --> 04:41.261
on Facebook.

04:41.262 --> 04:43.144
Not to accomplish anything, mind you.

04:43.145 --> 04:45.356
Simply to express my love for the show.

04:45.434 --> 04:47.868
Well, it ended up being
quite large, this fan club,

04:47.869 --> 04:49.438
and, uh, one morning,

04:49.439 --> 04:51.515
I think it was maybe early March,

04:51.516 --> 04:52.798
I got this Facebook message...

04:52.799 --> 04:55.771
A very nice message from the
people who make Cougar Town.

04:55.772 --> 04:58.479
- Looking for work?
- No, thanking me, Jeff...

04:58.480 --> 05:00.413
you know, for all the support
I generated for the show.

05:00.414 --> 05:01.994
And in the last paragraph, they said,

05:01.995 --> 05:04.603
"If you'd like, you could
come visit the set,"

05:04.639 --> 05:06.104
just like that.

05:06.236 --> 05:07.918
- Well, that's cool of them. 
- Mm-hmm.

05:07.919 --> 05:08.999
I guess that kind of makes them

05:09.000 --> 05:11.908
the Pulp Fictions of people.

05:12.153 --> 05:13.618
Man, how great was that movie.

05:13.619 --> 05:15.341
Yeah. So I sold a few
of my action figures,

05:15.342 --> 05:16.976
and I bought a round-trip
ticket to Los Angeles.

05:16.977 --> 05:19.501
- Wait, you went? When?
- Over spring break.

05:19.502 --> 05:21.712
What could I do?
Two days after I got that invitation,

05:21.713 --> 05:23.928
I was on the set of Cougar Town, Jeff.

05:24.126 --> 05:25.173
Cougar Town.

05:25.174 --> 05:26.540
Look, if you want me
to take it seriously,

05:26.541 --> 05:27.887
stop saying its name.

05:27.888 --> 05:28.968
You laugh, Jeff,

05:28.969 --> 05:31.150
but the people were wonderful,

05:31.374 --> 05:32.577
you know, not just the actors,

05:32.578 --> 05:33.920
but the crew, everyone.

05:33.921 --> 05:35.566
There must have been 200 people,

05:35.567 --> 05:37.494
each with a specific function,

05:37.495 --> 05:39.449
but all dedicated to a single purpose.

05:39.450 --> 05:41.500
It was like a village
or like a living thing.

05:41.501 --> 05:43.635
And, you know, I'm talking to the director,

05:43.636 --> 05:45.790
and he says, "Why don't you
jump into the background?"

05:46.047 --> 05:47.580
I say, "Nah, wait a minute.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.098
Jump into the background of what exactly?"

05:49.099 --> 05:51.081
And he says, "Jump into the
background of this scene.

05:51.158 --> 05:54.100
Walk through it. Walk through Cougar Town."

05:56.193 --> 05:57.189
Thank you.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.139
Well, before I can react, this
girl takes me by the hand,

05:59.140 --> 06:00.682
and she stands me behind this patio

06:00.683 --> 06:03.185
where Courtney Cox and the
actors are doing their scene.

06:03.186 --> 06:04.784
And the girl says, "Now,
when you hear 'action,'

06:04.785 --> 06:07.036
I want you to walk from
here to there," right?

06:07.037 --> 06:08.722
That's when I really
started to panic, Jeff,

06:08.723 --> 06:11.946
because if I'm a person
that watches Cougar Town,

06:11.950 --> 06:13.852
how can I be in Cougar Town?

06:14.588 --> 06:16.552
You know, and the more I
start thinking about it,

06:16.553 --> 06:18.880
the less any of it makes any sense at all.

06:18.881 --> 06:20.632
And I just want to turn and
run, but it's too late,

06:20.633 --> 06:22.255
because the director's calling "action."

06:22.256 --> 06:24.187
So before I take my first step,

06:24.188 --> 06:26.781
I realize that I have to stop being someone

06:26.782 --> 06:28.642
who's ever seen the show

06:28.643 --> 06:31.079
and become a character on the show.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.630
Become a man from Cougar Town...

06:34.141 --> 06:35.186
You know, someone born there,

06:35.187 --> 06:37.589
someone whose name, I decide, is Chad.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.920
And I take my first step, as a child might,

06:39.921 --> 06:41.529
learning to walk as Chad.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.302
And with each step, it becomes easier.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.176
And with each step, I
start remembering things

06:45.177 --> 06:48.007
from Chad's life, like his first kiss

06:48.008 --> 06:50.103
under the big tree at Cougar Town field...

06:50.104 --> 06:52.382
Playing soccer 
at Cougar Town Junior High...

06:53.048 --> 06:55.208
Finding my first chest hair in the shower,

06:55.209 --> 06:56.779
my first apartment,

06:56.780 --> 06:59.228
my first true love falling
for my best friend,

07:00.010 --> 07:03.428
birthdays, weddings, car crashes, taxes,

07:03.554 --> 07:05.776
playing charades at Thanksgiving.

07:07.508 --> 07:09.709
Chad had lived, Jeff.

07:10.687 --> 07:12.624
You know, Chad had lived more than Abed.

07:16.517 --> 07:20.695
And then they called "cut," 
and the scene was over.

07:20.696 --> 07:23.102
But I wasn't ready to stop being Chad,

07:23.103 --> 07:25.563
so I said to the director,
"Can we have one more take?"

07:25.564 --> 07:27.904
But they were already moving on.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.344
Courtney had nailed it.

07:33.325 --> 07:34.998
My lips started trembling,

07:34.999 --> 07:37.541
and my... my hands and my feet went numb.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.102
My... my knees buckled,

07:39.103 --> 07:41.418
and as I fell to the floor...

07:44.241 --> 07:46.188
I pooped my pants.

07:48.379 --> 07:49.824
I did...

07:50.239 --> 07:51.872
Because the truth is,
Jeff, I had been Chad,

07:51.873 --> 07:53.507
and Chad was dead.

07:54.513 --> 07:58.164
But as Abed, I was still alive,
so someone helped me up.

07:58.316 --> 08:00.837
And the wardrobe lady came over.
She gave me new pants.

08:00.838 --> 08:02.980
I thanked everyone, I apologized,

08:03.063 --> 08:05.950
and then I just got on a bus and
went straight to the airport.

08:09.257 --> 08:13.175
Um, your food's getting cold.

08:13.176 --> 08:15.468
Oh, how silly of me.

08:28.846 --> 08:30.586
Wondering if Abed's new best friend

08:30.587 --> 08:33.517
also got him the best gift?

08:33.798 --> 08:35.649
I got Abed the best gift.

08:36.284 --> 08:40.365
I'd tell you what it is, but
it's an even cooler secret.

08:42.342 --> 08:44.887
Britta, you promised
that this private party

08:44.888 --> 08:46.171
would be done by 8:00.

08:46.172 --> 08:47.800
You're doing this during
the peak business hours

08:47.801 --> 08:49.284
for nostalgic-themed diners.

08:49.285 --> 08:51.207
Oh, is that true?
Has that been researched?

08:51.208 --> 08:52.291
It has, Annie.

08:52.292 --> 08:53.736
After they get frightened
by the evening news,

08:53.737 --> 08:55.645
many seek the comforting
foods and soothing music

08:55.646 --> 08:57.135
of a pre-racial America.

08:57.136 --> 09:02.048
I'll give you all of my
tips from my next shift.

09:02.535 --> 09:03.971
Oh, your tips.

09:05.161 --> 09:08.423
All your tips? Wait, wait, all of them?

09:08.424 --> 09:12.320
Like, all the tips the
customers leave for you?

09:12.321 --> 09:14.392
Wow, is there any way we can
go ahead and spread that out

09:14.393 --> 09:17.085
over two years so I don't
get slammed on my taxes?

09:18.375 --> 09:19.594
Oh, my goodness.

09:19.595 --> 09:20.761
I know.

09:21.054 --> 09:23.369
- Everyone hates Britta. 
- Mm.

09:29.222 --> 09:31.326
Of course, you know the
real point of that story.

09:31.327 --> 09:33.289
I don't, but that's okay. Chew.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.860
The point is, I'd been a fool.

09:35.861 --> 09:37.637
Nah, everybody poops their pants.

09:37.638 --> 09:39.309
No, no, no, I was a
fool long before that.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.374
You know, I look back at my life
and I think, "Who was that?

09:41.375 --> 09:43.642
Why did he care so much about so
many things that didn't matter?"

09:43.643 --> 09:44.913
Yeah, who needs Cougar Town?

09:44.914 --> 09:46.276
Who needs any pop culture whatsoever?

09:46.277 --> 09:48.042
TV, movies... to hell with all of it.

09:48.590 --> 09:51.495
You know what I was, Jeff?
I was that wallet.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.692
On the surface, a reference
to some cinematic drivel,

09:53.693 --> 09:56.062
but on the inside... empty.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.813
- But you love Tarantino.
- No, no, not anymore.

09:59.814 --> 10:01.792
That's why I wanted to
have this dinner with you.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.160
This is the first birthday of my new life.

10:04.161 --> 10:05.206
You know, the wallet's cute, Jeff,

10:05.207 --> 10:07.265
but I'd like to exchange
it for a better gift.

10:07.266 --> 10:08.801
I'm not leaving here until you've given me

10:08.802 --> 10:10.842
my first real conversation.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.585
Yay.

10:20.205 --> 10:22.580
Okay, you want to have
a real conversation?

10:22.581 --> 10:25.806
Here's as real as I get
under the circumstances.

10:25.807 --> 10:29.068
It's nice that you've learned
to dial back your love of TV.

10:29.069 --> 10:31.584
But I'd really like you to
come have a milkshake with me.

10:31.585 --> 10:33.600
But before you do, I'd like you to remember

10:33.601 --> 10:36.011
how much you enjoy Pulp Fiction.

10:36.524 --> 10:38.761
Now, that's as far as I can go
without defeating the purpose.

10:38.762 --> 10:40.970
I'm really tilting the bean can here.

10:40.971 --> 10:43.102
Pulp Fiction, milkshakes, bean cans?

10:43.103 --> 10:44.427
Listen to how we talk to each other.

10:44.428 --> 10:47.585
We're like robots exchanging
catchphrases and references.

10:47.586 --> 10:49.181
And you think pointing that out counts

10:49.182 --> 10:50.613
as a real conversation?

10:50.614 --> 10:52.213
You know how many fake people are talking

10:52.214 --> 10:53.999
about how fake the world is right now?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.174
Okay, well, I'm new at this,

10:55.175 --> 10:56.710
so can you start our real conversation?

10:56.711 --> 10:58.224
I don't believe there's such a thing.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.642
Conversation was invented by
humans to conceal reality.

11:01.643 --> 11:05.201
We use it to sweet-talk our
way around natural selection.

11:05.202 --> 11:07.659
You know who has real conversations? 
Ants.

11:07.660 --> 11:10.579
They talk by vomiting chemicals
into each other's mouths.

11:10.580 --> 11:12.295
They get right down to brass tacks.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.099
Blehh! "Which way's the picnic?"

11:14.100 --> 11:15.795
Blehh! "That way."

11:16.114 --> 11:18.121
Humans are more evolved. We lie.

11:18.122 --> 11:19.596
- Not all the time. 
- That's a lie.

11:19.597 --> 11:22.132
- We don't lie when we're alone.
- Biggest lie ever.

11:22.133 --> 11:24.402
Nine out of ten lies occur six inches away

11:24.403 --> 11:25.548
from the bathroom mirror.

11:25.549 --> 11:27.351
We do most of our lying alone.

11:27.352 --> 11:29.068
How's it even possible
to lie when you're alone?

11:29.069 --> 11:30.693
You can call a phone-sex line.

11:30.694 --> 11:32.911
- That's lying to yourself.
- No, that's just being honest

11:32.912 --> 11:34.249
with a stranger about being lonely.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.274
What if you're dishonest
about why you're lonely?

11:36.275 --> 11:38.668
What if you're a good-looking
guy who calls a phone-sex line

11:38.669 --> 11:40.933
and tells them he weighs 400 pounds,

11:40.934 --> 11:44.061
just so he can hear a woman say
she's attracted to him anyway?

11:44.062 --> 11:46.726
- I don't believe that happens.
- Wrong. That's me.

11:46.727 --> 11:48.680
I did that last week.

11:48.681 --> 11:50.315
Why would you pay a woman on the phone

11:50.316 --> 11:51.341
to think you're fat?

11:51.342 --> 11:53.545
Because I'm scared that
if I were overweight

11:53.546 --> 11:55.272
that no one would like me.

11:56.921 --> 11:59.059
God, that feels good to admit.

12:00.785 --> 12:02.568
Abed, the point being...

12:04.618 --> 12:05.755
The point being,

12:05.756 --> 12:08.271
you don't have to worry about being normal

12:08.272 --> 12:11.330
or... or real or whatever this is tonight.

12:11.417 --> 12:15.466
The world is a sick place
full of sick, sick people.

12:19.897 --> 12:22.262
Can I tell you something
I've never told anyone else?

12:23.761 --> 12:24.967
Yes.

12:27.223 --> 12:30.183
It's got to be so cool,
whatever he got him.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.957
You know what I'm saying.
Winger's a man of means.

12:33.202 --> 12:36.290
He's with your boy right
now having a fancy dinner.

12:36.601 --> 12:41.331
Baby chickens, diamond
forks, brand-name sodas.

12:41.458 --> 12:44.038
Then he's gonna bring him back here,

12:44.201 --> 12:46.629
give him whatever's in
there, and that's that.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.733
Troy who?

13:00.801 --> 13:02.353
Is that what I think it is?

13:02.431 --> 13:03.882
It is.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.932
Certificate of authenticity...

13:05.933 --> 13:08.081
He must have got it on eBay or something.

13:08.392 --> 13:10.378
Jeff got Abed the actual briefcase

13:10.379 --> 13:12.164
from the movie Pulp Fiction!

13:12.516 --> 13:14.193
What are you guys doing?

13:14.205 --> 13:15.488
Chang made me open it!

13:15.489 --> 13:17.496
He seduced me with his dark Chinese powers.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.995
Why do you leave him alone with me?

13:18.996 --> 13:20.920
Guys, I am putting my job on the line

13:20.921 --> 13:22.209
for this stupid party,

13:22.210 --> 13:24.413
and the least you can do is not ruin it.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.501
No! No!

13:35.653 --> 13:38.071
Dude, I know I'm preaching to the choir,

13:38.072 --> 13:41.749
but you are a bad friend.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.355
I'll kill you!

13:54.123 --> 13:57.145
And I said, "No, that's a girl's costume."

13:57.146 --> 13:58.495
And my mom said, "It's fine.

13:58.496 --> 14:00.824
Indian boys have long hair and braids too."

14:00.825 --> 14:02.939
There was only 45 minutes
left to trick-or-treat,

14:02.940 --> 14:04.644
so what could I do?

14:06.064 --> 14:09.475
I put the damn thing on,
and I went door-to-door.

14:09.724 --> 14:13.021
And everyone was going,
"Oh, what a pretty little girl."

14:14.275 --> 14:15.782
And by the third house...

14:16.410 --> 14:18.124
I stopped correcting them.

14:19.105 --> 14:21.393
I mean, why draw attention to it?

14:23.289 --> 14:24.476
And, honestly,

14:24.477 --> 14:26.816
once the shame and the fear wore off...

14:28.816 --> 14:31.526
I was just glad they thought I was pretty.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.487
God, this is incredible...

14:38.151 --> 14:41.375
I mean, to be able to talk this openly.

14:41.928 --> 14:43.941
I mean, why can't people be like this?

14:43.942 --> 14:45.806
I mean, what's wrong with this world?

14:52.823 --> 14:53.903
What do you want?

14:53.904 --> 14:55.929
So this is what you're
doing while we wait.

14:55.930 --> 14:58.634
Just go home, Pierce.
The party's canceled.

14:58.635 --> 15:01.549
Pretty gay, man. Pretty gay.

15:04.453 --> 15:06.879
Why is Pierce dressed as
the gimp from Pulp Fiction?

15:06.990 --> 15:08.145
Oh.

15:08.146 --> 15:11.137
The wallet, milkshakes...

15:11.202 --> 15:13.078
Did you set up a surprise
Pulp Fiction birthday party?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.530
Yeah, at the greasy fork,
but that doesn't matter now.

15:15.666 --> 15:18.796
What matters is this... talking.

15:19.104 --> 15:20.763
It everything okay?

15:20.764 --> 15:22.507
Uh, yes. Just the check, please.

15:22.508 --> 15:25.778
Oh, I'm sorry. So you're ending early?

15:25.779 --> 15:27.204
Because in my dinner with Andre,

15:27.205 --> 15:30.541
- the waiter brings...
- Check, check, check. Bye.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.835
- Abed? 
- Mm-hmm?

15:36.007 --> 15:38.190
What's my dinner with Andre?

15:38.409 --> 15:41.363
It's just a movie about, uh, two guys

15:41.364 --> 15:43.374
talking at a restaurant.

15:45.064 --> 15:46.901
So this wasn't...

15:46.904 --> 15:49.385
A real conversation?

15:49.386 --> 15:50.815
You were doing another movie?

15:50.816 --> 15:52.163
A movie about a real conversation.

15:52.164 --> 15:54.513
Did you poop your pants
on the set of Cougar Town?

15:55.338 --> 15:56.801
That shouldn't matter.

15:57.154 --> 15:59.077
This is why we don't hang out!

16:00.006 --> 16:02.016
Well, thanks for getting me fired, jerks.

16:02.017 --> 16:04.025
- The party's over.
- Cool. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

16:04.026 --> 16:05.182
Yeah, it is.

16:05.183 --> 16:09.173
Do you guys know where Abed's
really cool present is?

16:09.241 --> 16:10.461
Because I'm returning it.

16:10.462 --> 16:13.193
Um, it's back at the diner. It's fine.

16:13.194 --> 16:15.039
It probably just needs some detailing.

16:18.877 --> 16:22.250
Man, I really wish you
two got along better.

16:23.372 --> 16:25.448
Ooh, no-no juice.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.450
Ah, that's good no-no juice.

16:32.911 --> 16:34.817
For the damages

16:34.818 --> 16:37.185
if you promise to give Britta her job back.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.582
$800, and she stays fired.

16:39.583 --> 16:40.796
Deal.

16:50.171 --> 16:51.722
Annie told me about the briefcase.

16:52.451 --> 16:54.548
- Thank you. 
- What a waste.

16:54.872 --> 16:56.105
Not really.

16:57.370 --> 16:57.912
Did you buy it

16:57.913 --> 17:00.377
from Willy's 100% Authentic
Cinema Treasures on eBay?

17:00.378 --> 17:02.686
- Yep. 
- Yeah, Willy exaggerates.

17:02.972 --> 17:05.336
I got Indiana Jones' real whip from him.

17:05.337 --> 17:06.810
He moves about 70 of those a year.

17:06.810 --> 17:08.097
Oh, good. I thought I flushed

17:08.098 --> 17:09.307
a bunch of money down the toilet.

17:09.308 --> 17:11.342
But it's great to know that the
real Pulp Fiction briefcase

17:11.343 --> 17:12.755
is safe somewhere.

17:12.935 --> 17:14.458
You're mad at me.

17:14.906 --> 17:16.565
I spent a week planning a party

17:16.566 --> 17:17.872
just to make you happy.

17:17.873 --> 17:19.616
And then I bailed on the
party and ruined it,

17:19.617 --> 17:20.943
again, just to make you happy.

17:20.944 --> 17:22.843
Then it turns out, while
I was wasting my time

17:22.844 --> 17:24.154
trying to make you happy,

17:24.155 --> 17:27.761
you were making yourself
happy all over everyone else

17:27.762 --> 17:30.828
by doing yet another stupid movie spoof.

17:30.829 --> 17:32.363
I prefer the term "homage."

17:34.373 --> 17:35.957
It wasn't about making me happy.

17:36.784 --> 17:38.869
I chose my dinner with Andre,
because it's about a guy

17:38.870 --> 17:40.367
who has an unexpectedly enjoyable evening

17:40.368 --> 17:42.823
with a weird friend he's
been avoiding lately.

17:44.754 --> 17:46.665
You think I've been avoiding you?

17:47.203 --> 17:48.915
You and I hung out more last year.

17:49.758 --> 17:51.120
It makes sense.

17:51.332 --> 17:53.032
Everyone else is growing
and changing all the time,

17:53.033 --> 17:54.752
and that's not really my jam.

17:55.598 --> 17:57.563
I'm more of a fast-blinking,
stoic, removed,

17:57.564 --> 17:59.434
uncomfortably self-aware type...

17:59.597 --> 18:00.861
Like Data...

18:01.062 --> 18:03.390
Or Johnny-5 or Mork

18:03.391 --> 18:05.566
or Hal or K.I.T.T. or K-9...

18:05.567 --> 18:07.008
Or Woodstock and/or Snoopy.

18:07.009 --> 18:08.479
Of course, Spock probably
goes without saying...

18:08.480 --> 18:11.377
Abed, I don't need you to grow or change.

18:12.098 --> 18:15.036
And take it from someone who
just had a meaningless one,

18:15.037 --> 18:17.558
sometimes emotional
breakthroughs are overrated.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.094
And, seriously, I need you to keep

18:21.095 --> 18:24.297
a tight, heavy lid on the
"Little Indian Girl" story.

18:24.298 --> 18:26.584
- Sure. 
- Tight, heavy lid.

18:26.585 --> 18:28.198
Cool. T.H.L.

18:31.064 --> 18:32.460
Still friends?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.519
Because nobody paid for
dinner at the restaurant,

18:38.584 --> 18:40.515
and I do not have this kind of money.

18:46.545 --> 18:48.375
I went back to pay the bill.

18:48.455 --> 18:50.260
The restaurant was closed.

18:54.964 --> 18:57.572
Surprise!

18:58.561 --> 19:00.735
- Surprise. 
- It was Abed's idea.

19:02.357 --> 19:05.098
The group had stayed behind
to salvage the party.

19:07.820 --> 19:09.974
The waiter had felt bad
for spilling the beans

19:09.975 --> 19:12.993
about Abed's homage, so he let us stay.

19:20.183 --> 19:23.346
As parties go, it was quiet, dark,

19:23.347 --> 19:24.953
and a little lame.

19:29.189 --> 19:32.561
We'd had better parties, and
we'd had worse parties.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.147
But I doubt I'll ever forget

19:46.148 --> 19:48.924
my dinner with Andre dinner with Abed.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.584
- Thanks. 
- Abed, please...

20:02.054 --> 20:04.057
- Allow me. 
- Okay. Thanks.

20:08.752 --> 20:10.044
Let me see.

20:10.533 --> 20:11.986
Mm, that's not good.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.355
They said "market price."

20:16.678 --> 20:19.638
What market are you shopping at?

20:25.061 --> 20:26.407
I'm going to run.

20:26.408 --> 20:27.604
- Me too. 
- Okay.

20:27.605 --> 20:28.643
- On three. 
- One...

20:28.644 --> 20:29.855
- Two... 
- Three.
