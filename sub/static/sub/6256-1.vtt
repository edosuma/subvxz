BRENNAN: If this was the man

03:58.361 --> 03:59.728
M.E. lists cause of death

03:59.762 --> 04:00.796

04:00.830 --> 04:01.830
The squints here
suspect murder.

04:01.864 --> 04:03.532
MONTENEGRO:
So a large portion

04:03.566 --> 04:06.034
of the data on Foster's chip
focused on Cooper--

04:06.069 --> 04:09.404
how he started, his rise
in the EPA, how he died.

04:09.439 --> 04:11.406
So you're saying
that Cooper's death

04:11.441 --> 04:14.810
could be the point of origin
for this entire conspiracy?

04:14.844 --> 04:16.445
Yep. We solve this,

04:16.478 --> 04:18.180
we could find out who's
behind the whole thing.

getting killed in here, Booth.

their hands clean.

05:26.382 --> 05:27.849
he's on the chip.

05:27.884 --> 05:30.252
Booth, we have information
we can use against him.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.520
No. Don't. It's too dangerous.

05:31.554 --> 05:33.321

they shut us down.

that much time, Booth.

Yes.

06:06.789 --> 06:08.089

06:10.660 --> 06:13.929
I think we have a lot
to discuss, actually.

06:21.404 --> 06:23.538
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

06:23.573 --> 06:25.173
Yes, I'm blackmailing you.

released.

06:30.847 --> 06:32.848

a federal prosecutor?

06:32.882 --> 06:34.816
I could receive
20 years in prison,

06:34.851 --> 06:37.085
civil forfeitures of real estate
and personal property,

06:37.119 --> 06:38.753
and a fine of $250,000.

06:38.788 --> 06:41.356
While there is a
statistical risk

06:41.390 --> 06:44.826
that you'd arrest me,
the odds are far more

06:44.861 --> 06:46.428
in my favor.

06:46.462 --> 06:48.363

the things that you've done,

06:48.397 --> 06:51.499

06:51.534 --> 06:53.101
witness tampering,

06:53.135 --> 06:55.437
accepting bribes,

06:55.471 --> 06:57.205
money laundering,
to name a few--

06:57.240 --> 06:58.773
these would not only subject you

06:58.808 --> 07:01.810
to state
and federal prosecution,

07:01.844 --> 07:03.912
but, more likely,
they'd get you killed,

07:03.946 --> 07:06.248
because of the people
you dealt with.

07:06.282 --> 07:09.851
I feel confident you'll opt

11:50.101 --> 11:51.635
Look at the right tibia
you broke.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.370
Well, thank you for
bringing that up again.

11:53.404 --> 11:54.938
It was a lucky mistake,
actually.

11:54.972 --> 11:58.542
The cancer hadn't progressed
to the marrow.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.578
So Cooper didn't die
from leukemia.

12:01.580 --> 12:03.446
No, it was another cause.

12:03.481 --> 12:04.881
So Cooper didn't die from leukemia.
The M.E. report is a lie.

12:04.916 --> 12:06.583
HODGINS: You sound surprised
by that. Okay, kids.

12:06.617 --> 12:07.472
I got the gelva.

12:07.473 --> 12:09.178
Grab those, and let's
clean these bones.

12:09.202 --> 12:10.320
Gelva?

12:10.321 --> 12:13.123
Yep. Yeah, one of my favorite
multipolymer acrylics.

12:13.157 --> 12:14.858
Now, I figured
out a way

12:14.892 --> 12:17.928
to aerosolize the gelva so I can
spray it over the bones.

12:17.962 --> 12:20.297
Won't that fuse the adipocere
to the bones?

12:20.331 --> 12:22.532
Yes, but once it hardens,
you can chip off the adipocere,

12:22.567 --> 12:24.367
and the bones won't crumble.
Masks on.

12:34.111 --> 12:36.012
Look, the key is Cooper.

12:36.047 --> 12:39.849
Okay, the EPA kept promoting him
even though he wasn't qualified.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.686
And he died days after
he denied a permit

12:42.720 --> 12:46.523
to Sanderson Chemical
to build a new plant.

12:47.625 --> 12:48.625
Eat, Booth.

12:48.659 --> 12:50.360
You know I don't
got no time.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.362
Hugo Sanderson was running
the company when Cooper died,

12:52.396 --> 12:53.396
and he's still running it.

12:53.431 --> 12:55.198
You know what I got to do;

12:55.232 --> 12:57.192
I got to bring this guy
Sanderson into the office.

12:57.201 --> 12:58.868
I got to talk to him, and...
Not yet.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.136
You... you can't go
into work yet.

13:00.171 --> 13:01.605
Why? I was released.

13:01.639 --> 13:04.004
Sweets says all the other agents
still regard you

13:04.004 --> 13:05.735
as someone who killed
three of their colleagues.

13:05.735 --> 13:07.190
You're a pariah there.
Come on, Bones.

13:07.191 --> 13:08.008
What do you want me to do here?

13:08.009 --> 13:09.342
(phone ringing)
Just sit here and do nothing?

13:09.400 --> 13:11.615
Huh?

13:13.017 --> 13:14.017
Brennan.

13:14.051 --> 13:16.319
You're confident
it can work?

13:16.354 --> 13:18.121
With minimal damage?

13:19.023 --> 13:20.390
Okay!

13:21.792 --> 13:23.727
Hodgins and Clark found a way
to clean the bones.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.862
I have to get
back to the lab.

13:25.896 --> 13:27.464
Are you...
gonna be okay?

13:27.498 --> 13:28.932
No, I've got to talk
to this guy Sanderson.

13:28.966 --> 13:30.233
Wait, please.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.334
Sweets is coming over.

13:31.369 --> 13:32.802
He'll explain everything.

13:32.837 --> 13:36.139
I... I have to go.

13:37.508 --> 13:39.843
Sure, yeah. Go.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.661
Hey.

13:57.695 --> 13:58.695
Hey.

13:58.729 --> 13:59.796
Booth's back home.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.231
Oh, good.

14:01.265 --> 14:02.932
Well, I guess
the blinds will be drawn,

14:02.967 --> 14:04.801
and we won't see Dr. B
for a while.

14:04.835 --> 14:06.970
No, the bones are almost clean,
and she's on her way in.

14:07.004 --> 14:08.972
Right. Tick-tock.

14:09.006 --> 14:10.874
You don't think they're in any
kind of danger again, do you?

14:10.908 --> 14:13.943
It would be crazy for them to go
after Booth again, you know?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.979
It would show their hand,
and they're smarter than that.

14:16.013 --> 14:18.748
Yeah, but we're smarter
than them, right?

14:18.783 --> 14:22.419
Both the adipocere
and the clothes show

14:22.453 --> 14:26.089
that Cooper was washed in a
strong germicide before burial.

14:26.123 --> 14:28.043
That's a common practice
in mortuaries, isn't it?

14:28.059 --> 14:30.960
Well, not with a derivative
of dichloroamino acid.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.862
That's more than
a common antiseptic.

14:32.897 --> 14:35.365
Someone was getting rid
of evidence.

14:36.934 --> 14:39.869
Sanderson only got permission
to build the plant

14:39.904 --> 14:40.904
after Cooper died.

14:40.938 --> 14:42.005
ah, ah, yeah.

14:42.039 --> 14:43.707
And it was all hushed up.
I know.

14:43.741 --> 14:46.342
You know, you haven't even
let me say a proper hello yet?

14:46.377 --> 14:48.878
Yeah, I know,
but there's just...

14:50.481 --> 14:52.649
(sighs)
All right.

14:54.485 --> 14:56.186
It's good to
see you, Sweets.

14:56.220 --> 14:59.189
Yeah. You, too. This place
sure beats the lockup, huh?

14:59.223 --> 15:00.390
It's nice!

15:00.424 --> 15:01.558
Yeah.

15:01.592 --> 15:03.059
It's nice.

15:03.094 --> 15:04.728
Thanks.

15:04.762 --> 15:06.996
Thanks, by the way.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.799
For what? It was Dr. Brennan
that got you out.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.868
No. No, she told me.
You know, you were there.

15:11.902 --> 15:13.203
You-you were
there for her.

15:13.237 --> 15:15.705
You... you helped out
with the move.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.940
You were there
for Christine.

15:16.974 --> 15:18.508
That's enough.
You know what?

15:18.542 --> 15:20.176
It's nothing you wouldn't
have done for me.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.945
Sure.

15:21.979 --> 15:25.248
All right, look, uh... when
can I go back to work? Huh?

15:25.282 --> 15:27.517
Sweets, maybe you can write me
one of those shrinky letters

15:27.551 --> 15:29.052
or something like that.
Back to work?

15:29.086 --> 15:30.687
You've only been out
for a few hours.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.821
Before you jump back...
No, Sweets!

15:31.856 --> 15:33.389
No. Nothing is
gonna stop me

15:33.424 --> 15:35.258
from finding the person
who did this to us.

15:35.292 --> 15:36.426
You understand me? Nothing.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.461
You sound like
you want vengeance.

15:38.496 --> 15:39.562
What's wrong with that?

15:39.597 --> 15:41.664
You usually talk about justice.

15:41.699 --> 15:43.299
It always ends up
the same way, huh?

15:43.334 --> 15:44.400
You make someone pay.

15:44.435 --> 15:46.035
You know what?
I can't...

15:46.070 --> 15:47.537
I can't just sit around
here and do nothing.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.872
I got to go talk
to Hugo Sanderson.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.040
No, the Bureau is
not gonna let you.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.010
Look, Sweets, I don't need
the Bureau's permission

15:54.012 --> 15:55.245
to finish this

15:56.881 --> 15:58.841
Look, Sweets, I don't need
Are you with me, or no?

15:59.950 --> 16:01.885
Yeah.

16:04.121 --> 16:05.588
SAROYAN:
How's it going?

16:05.623 --> 16:07.290
Too slowly.
I wanted to be finished

16:07.324 --> 16:08.758
before Dr. Brennan got here.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.493
Are you damaging
the bones?

16:10.528 --> 16:12.028
Slightly. It's unavoidable.

16:12.062 --> 16:15.098
But I did a set of scans
and X-rays prior to removal.

16:15.132 --> 16:18.101
We can compare the compromised
areas to what was there before.

16:18.135 --> 16:20.470
And, so far, no injuries
that could be cause of death?

16:20.504 --> 16:22.438
No. Just remodeled breaks--
ribs, sternum--

16:22.473 --> 16:26.576
that were sustained about
five years before his death.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.578
Well, I got clear tox results
from the adipocere.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.381
Just chemo, pain
and nausea medications

16:31.415 --> 16:32.615
any cancer patient
would have taken.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.450
No poisons, no
lethal toxins...

16:34.485 --> 16:36.152
Could they have administered
an overdose

16:36.187 --> 16:38.321
of, uh, chemo or pain meds?

16:38.355 --> 16:40.924
No, I would have seen it.
All the levels are in line

16:40.958 --> 16:42.458
with standard protocol,
so...

16:42.493 --> 16:45.461
At this point, the ball
is in your court, Dr. Edison.

16:52.002 --> 16:54.270
Mr. Sanderson.
Agent Booth with the FBI.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.905
I need to ask you
a couple questions.

16:55.940 --> 16:57.540
Pleased to meet
you, Agent Booth.

16:57.575 --> 16:59.542
Uh, I have tickets
to the opera tonight.

16:59.577 --> 17:02.045
And while talking to you
would be preferable,

17:02.079 --> 17:03.112
my wife wouldn't agree.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.981
Ah, it's not
gonna take long.

17:05.015 --> 17:07.584
I need to know a little bit
about your plant

17:07.617 --> 17:09.018
in Chesapeake estuary.

17:09.053 --> 17:12.055
The EPA looked into
those dumping charges,

17:12.089 --> 17:14.057
and none were filed.

17:14.090 --> 17:16.960
Right, I'm sure, but who I want
to know about is Howard Cooper.

17:16.993 --> 17:18.428
Who?
Howard Cooper, the first guy

17:18.462 --> 17:20.563
who denied your permit
to build that plant.

17:20.598 --> 17:21.897
Well, I don't handle
paperwork, Agent Booth,

17:21.932 --> 17:23.333
so I wouldn't know...

17:23.367 --> 17:26.202
He died
shortly after that.

17:27.637 --> 17:29.572
And how does that relate to me?
Pretty directly.

17:29.607 --> 17:32.709
Two weeks after he died,
you got your permit.

17:32.743 --> 17:34.911
What are you insinuating?

17:34.945 --> 17:36.546
Just having a conversation,
that's all.

17:36.580 --> 17:37.814
Better than the opera.

17:39.283 --> 17:41.251
We should get you there;
you're running late.

17:45.422 --> 17:46.923
In case you didn't know,

17:46.957 --> 17:49.425
your boss is
a very good friend of mine.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.862
I think you're intimidating
the wrong man, Agent Booth.

18:12.816 --> 18:14.517
(elevator bell dings)

18:34.738 --> 18:36.439
Who are you?

18:36.473 --> 18:37.941
Special Agent James Aubrey, FBI.

18:37.975 --> 18:39.776
Check my pocket for the badge.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.748
Who sent you?

18:45.783 --> 18:47.350
Deputy Director Stark.

18:47.384 --> 18:49.085
Keep you
out of trouble.

18:49.119 --> 18:50.920
Which I clearly didn't do.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.189
Nice move bringing me down,
by the way.

18:53.223 --> 18:54.824
You have to teach me that one.

18:58.266 --> 19:00.167
STARK: <i> What the hell you think</i>
<i>you're doing, Booth?</i>

19:00.202 --> 19:03.138
Sanderson called the director,
saying you harassed him.

19:03.172 --> 19:05.340
I'm doing my job, which is
more than I can say for you.

19:05.374 --> 19:07.142
Watch it, Booth, or you're gonna...
Or what?

19:07.176 --> 19:09.577
What are you gonna do, huh?
Plus, I don't need a babysitter,

19:09.612 --> 19:11.246
or a tail, or whatever
the hell this kid is.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.715
Calling me a "kid"
is kind of insulting.

19:13.749 --> 19:15.550
Just in case you've forgotten,
Booth, I call the shots here,

19:15.584 --> 19:17.764
and you haven't been
assigned any case.

19:17.788 --> 19:18.353
Right, the case

19:18.354 --> 19:20.635
that I was on <i>before</i> I was
thrown into jail is still open.

19:20.656 --> 19:22.323
You know what?
I intend to finish that.

19:22.358 --> 19:24.292
Those people out there
think you killed

19:24.326 --> 19:26.261
three of their own,
and they're not gonna help.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.797
There has to be some
mutual respect and trust.

19:28.831 --> 19:31.566
I'm sorry-- trust? Seriously,
you think I trust you?

19:31.600 --> 19:32.634
You think I trust
this place?

19:32.668 --> 19:34.135
Booth.
What?!

19:34.170 --> 19:36.137
The charges against me
were dropped--

19:36.172 --> 19:37.539
no thanks to you.

19:37.573 --> 19:40.008
I have a right
to my badge and my gun.

19:40.042 --> 19:41.509
Legally, he's correct, sir.

19:42.445 --> 19:43.812
But you know that.

19:43.846 --> 19:45.080
Look, whoever
did this to me

19:45.114 --> 19:46.748
and my wife,
they're gonna pay.

19:46.782 --> 19:48.683
Then, after that, you can
have my badge and my gun;

19:48.718 --> 19:49.851
you'll never see me again.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.823
SWEETS: Look, you
can't just leave him

19:54.857 --> 19:57.192
with no way
to defend himself, sir.

19:57.226 --> 19:58.226
I'll stay with him.

19:58.227 --> 19:59.327
Fine.

19:59.361 --> 20:00.829
Get him his gun and his badge.

20:00.863 --> 20:02.464
But he's your responsibility.

20:06.068 --> 20:08.336
MONTENEGRO:
So how is it for you and Booth

20:08.370 --> 20:10.371
now that you're back together?

20:11.540 --> 20:13.441
It doesn't feel
as if we are.

20:13.476 --> 20:16.211
He's... consumed
with the case.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.815
Well, I think you should take
what you need.

20:20.850 --> 20:24.219
The case is important,
but so are the two of you.

20:24.253 --> 20:26.321
And if he disagrees,

20:26.355 --> 20:29.557
then... you show him he's wrong.

20:30.593 --> 20:32.293
(computer beeping)

20:32.328 --> 20:38.133
Oh, you can see all
of the remodeled fractures now.

20:38.167 --> 20:40.869
The medical records
from the Bethesda E.R. say that

20:40.903 --> 20:44.405
he fell down a flight
of stairs 21 years ago.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.142
I've never seen injuries like
this from a fall down stairs.

20:47.176 --> 20:51.146
So someone covered up the cause
of <i> these</i> injuries, too?

20:51.180 --> 20:53.915
Can you work out a scenario
that involves a car accident?

20:55.351 --> 20:57.585
Well, we could have done
this at my place, Sweets.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.821
I have dedicated access
to the Bureau's servers here,

20:59.855 --> 21:01.422
in case we need it.

21:01.457 --> 21:03.358
Right, but, look, I bet
you haven't found anything

21:03.392 --> 21:04.325
in them about Sanderson.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.427
(sighs) Not yet.
Exactly.

21:06.462 --> 21:07.862
And you won't.
You want to know why?

21:07.897 --> 21:09.564
Because Sanderson is one
of them-- has to be.

21:09.598 --> 21:11.132
Maybe, but you can't
just go charging

21:11.167 --> 21:12.834
after people like that
unless you have proof.

21:12.868 --> 21:15.870
Wait, are you telling me
how to run my investigation now?

21:15.905 --> 21:18.072
Yeah. Yeah, I am, Booth.
'Cause you're not acting

21:18.107 --> 21:19.974
like the agent
that you were, okay?

21:20.009 --> 21:21.242
This is too personal.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.114
Wait a second.

21:26.148 --> 21:27.682
Agent Booth!

21:27.716 --> 21:29.050
You and...

21:29.084 --> 21:30.485
You're...

21:30.519 --> 21:32.453
The two of you? You...

21:32.488 --> 21:34.255
You're gonna have a-a...

21:34.290 --> 21:35.690
Yeah.

21:35.724 --> 21:37.926
Lance and I bumped
into each other

21:37.960 --> 21:39.594
a few times this
past year, and...

21:39.628 --> 21:41.763
one of those bumps
turned into a bump.

21:41.797 --> 21:44.332
Wow, a baby.
Why didn't you tell me this?

21:44.366 --> 21:45.767
I don't know, I...
You just got out.

21:45.801 --> 21:46.901
I figured my life wasn't
that important.

21:46.936 --> 21:47.969
Seriously?

21:49.905 --> 21:51.806
Wow. That's, uh...

21:52.675 --> 21:53.975
Wow, that's amazing.

21:54.009 --> 21:55.910
DAISY:
And it's a boy.

21:55.945 --> 21:58.913
And you're the
godfather, of course.

22:00.349 --> 22:01.909
I'm so glad you're out and not dead.
I...

22:01.917 --> 22:03.751
I got a couple souvenirs there

22:03.786 --> 22:05.153
from prison still.

22:05.187 --> 22:08.723
Well, Lance is gonna help you,
Agent Booth.

22:08.757 --> 22:10.625
It's all he's been
talking about.

22:10.659 --> 22:11.926
He says you're family.

22:11.961 --> 22:13.461
All right, Daisy.
Come on, let's...

22:13.495 --> 22:14.896
It's true.

22:14.930 --> 22:17.165
This is all gonna
end well, you'll see.

22:17.199 --> 22:20.368
Isn't that right, little Lance?

22:23.806 --> 22:25.807
Cooper didn't fall
down the stairs,

22:25.841 --> 22:28.810
he had a bilateral
Smith's fracture.

22:28.844 --> 22:30.945
All right, is that good?

22:30.980 --> 22:32.280
Bilateral Smith's fractures
are often caused

22:32.314 --> 22:33.448
by airbags being deployed.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.049
So he was in a car accident?

22:35.084 --> 22:36.818
Yes, Angela did a
recreation of the accident

22:36.852 --> 22:39.320
based on his remodeled injuries.

22:39.355 --> 22:41.656
It was a strong impact.

22:41.690 --> 22:45.727
Like the car struck something
and lost control.

22:45.761 --> 22:47.161
Well, why is that important?

22:47.196 --> 22:49.063
I mean, it was years
before he was killed.

22:49.098 --> 22:50.331
Because it was covered up.

22:50.366 --> 22:51.532
Just like his death-- why?

22:51.567 --> 22:53.701
Why are all the
injuries on this man

22:53.736 --> 22:56.070
made to look like
something else?

22:57.373 --> 22:58.506
I missed you.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.708
(groans softly)

23:00.743 --> 23:02.277
I'm fine. What are you doing?

23:02.311 --> 23:04.212
Your coracohumeral ligament
is strained, Booth.

23:04.246 --> 23:06.047
Let me help you.

23:06.081 --> 23:09.417
No, I don't want you to get
all "cocoa humerous" on me.

23:09.451 --> 23:11.853
(groans, inhales sharply)

23:11.887 --> 23:13.087
Booth.

23:13.122 --> 23:14.689
Yeah. I-I'm fine.

23:14.723 --> 23:16.763
It just, you know, hurts
when I breathe, that's all.

23:20.195 --> 23:22.030
I won't hurt you.

23:28.871 --> 23:31.372
I promise
this won't hurt a bit.

23:31.407 --> 23:33.207
All right.

23:43.351 --> 23:44.585
BOOTH:
<i>So, Dr. Durant,</i>

23:44.619 --> 23:46.053
you were an E.R. doctor at

23:46.087 --> 23:47.755
Bethesda Presbyterian,
correct?

23:47.789 --> 23:49.723
Uh, well,
over 20 years ago, yes.

23:49.758 --> 23:51.658
But, uh, hadn't been
a practicing physician

23:51.693 --> 23:53.127
in a long time.

23:53.161 --> 23:56.096
As you can see, I'm a, uh...
a pencil-pusher now.

23:56.131 --> 23:58.332
But this job still requires
your medical expertise.

23:58.366 --> 24:01.001
Oh, yes. I'm, uh, one of
the chief analysts for, uh...

24:01.035 --> 24:03.337
medical research and testing
of new technology,

24:03.371 --> 24:05.506
procedures, drugs, and...

24:05.540 --> 24:07.207
What is this about?

24:07.242 --> 24:09.476
While you were in the E.R.,
you treated a Howard Cooper.

24:09.511 --> 24:12.279
It says here in your records
that he fell down a flight of...

24:12.313 --> 24:15.149
stairs.
That correct?

24:15.183 --> 24:17.785
Um, this was 21 years ago.

24:17.819 --> 24:19.586
I hope you don't expect me
to remember him.

24:19.621 --> 24:21.054
BRENNAN: I've been
examining Cooper's remains,

24:21.089 --> 24:23.123
and it seems clear
that he sustained injuries

24:23.158 --> 24:24.792
from a car accident.

24:24.826 --> 24:26.860
He had a bilateral Smith's
fracture as well as...

24:26.895 --> 24:30.831
Is this some kind of
decades-old malpractice case?

24:30.865 --> 24:32.966
No, we're thinking that Cooper
was murdered five years later,

24:33.001 --> 24:34.635
and there may have been
some kind of a cover-up.

24:34.669 --> 24:36.770
Oh, you think that
I-I covered this up.

24:36.805 --> 24:38.305
A man comes in
with fractures and contusions,

24:38.339 --> 24:40.474
and says that he fell
down a flight of stairs.

24:40.508 --> 24:42.276
So I took him
at his word,

24:42.310 --> 24:44.678
and I moved on;
and now 20 years later,

24:44.712 --> 24:46.180
you come in here
and accuse me of murder.

24:46.214 --> 24:48.282
Wow, you really are
defensive, aren't you?

24:48.316 --> 24:50.217
I did my best
in that E.R., okay?

24:50.251 --> 24:51.919
And maybe I wasn't
the best doctor.

24:51.953 --> 24:54.188
That's clear.
Which is why I ended up here.

24:54.222 --> 24:55.722
But am a very good manager.

24:55.757 --> 24:56.890
This department has received
commendations twice

24:56.925 --> 24:58.659
in just the past five years.

24:58.693 --> 25:01.728
So if you have nothing to hide,
why don't you help us out?

25:01.763 --> 25:03.430
Perhaps, if you looked
at the injuries,

25:03.465 --> 25:05.365
something might come to mind
that would explain

25:05.400 --> 25:07.134
why Cooper lied
about the accident.

25:11.005 --> 25:13.674
A-Anything I can do to help.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.542
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

25:15.577 --> 25:17.744
Right.

25:17.779 --> 25:19.112
We'll be in touch.

25:19.147 --> 25:20.380
Or, if you have anything else,

25:20.415 --> 25:21.415
just call mere.

25:21.416 --> 25:22.749
Of course.

25:27.655 --> 25:30.791
How did it go
with the E.R. doc?

25:30.825 --> 25:32.292
Booth feels he's
hiding something.

25:32.327 --> 25:33.794
I cannot believe
he's back to work.

25:33.828 --> 25:35.696
Has he rested at all
since he got out?

25:35.730 --> 25:38.799
It's Booth-- he's fine.
Determined.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.334
What have you
found, Dr. Edison?

25:40.368 --> 25:42.102
Damage to the carpels,
very little remodeling.

25:42.136 --> 25:44.238
So injuries occurred
around time of death.

25:44.272 --> 25:45.639
They're defensive wounds.

25:45.673 --> 25:47.708
But the victim was
in a hospital bed.

25:47.742 --> 25:50.177
Which means, if he was supine
at the time of an attack,

25:50.211 --> 25:52.913
the injuries suggest he was
pushing away the assailant.

25:52.947 --> 25:54.681
EDISON: But that doesn't
give us cause of death.

25:54.716 --> 25:56.717
Or motive.
HODGINS: Remorse.

25:56.751 --> 25:58.418
Cooper does
the conspiracy's bidding

25:58.453 --> 25:59.953
and advances quickly
through the EPA, right?

25:59.988 --> 26:01.655
Then he gets cancer,
has nothing to lose.

26:01.689 --> 26:03.657
So he stands up to him
and says, no more.

26:03.691 --> 26:05.826
They're threatened, think he
might talk, so they kill him.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.561
That's good. It's very good.

26:07.595 --> 26:09.663
Well, too bad it's
not supported by fact.

26:09.697 --> 26:11.798
Look for any more
defensive wounds.

26:11.833 --> 26:13.901
If he was fighting
for his life,

26:13.935 --> 26:17.137
there must be more
evidence of it.

26:17.171 --> 26:19.740
Thank you.

26:19.774 --> 26:23.043
Well, I'm surprised you want
an opinion from a psychologist.

26:23.077 --> 26:26.079
I don't.
I want an opinion from a friend.

26:27.081 --> 26:28.448
Not Angela?

26:28.483 --> 26:30.517
You know Booth better, Sweets.

26:30.552 --> 26:32.753
And... occasionally...

26:32.787 --> 26:36.223
there is logic behind the
pseudoscience that you practice.

26:36.257 --> 26:38.257
Wow, that's high praise
coming from you. Thank you.

26:39.494 --> 26:41.595
It's just...

26:41.629 --> 26:42.930
(sighs)

26:42.964 --> 26:44.464
Booth is different.

26:44.499 --> 26:45.499
I agree.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.733
He has a lot to deal with,

26:46.768 --> 26:48.001
after all that's happened--

26:48.036 --> 26:50.137
the incarceration,
the attack, now...

26:50.171 --> 26:52.105
Booth suffered trauma before--

26:52.140 --> 26:56.677
war, abduction, confinement,
even torture.

26:56.711 --> 26:58.946
Yeah, but this is different.
I've seen the injuries;

26:58.980 --> 27:00.781
the trauma is similar.
Physically, yeah.

27:00.815 --> 27:04.785
But not, according to my
pseudoscience, psychologically.

27:04.819 --> 27:07.721
Booth is driven by

27:07.755 --> 27:11.358
his belief in honesty,
in honor and service.

27:11.392 --> 27:13.660
Now, Booth's beliefs
have been betrayed

27:13.695 --> 27:17.264
by the organization
that he trusted, that he served.

27:17.298 --> 27:19.166
I-It's as if someone died.

27:20.134 --> 27:21.702
It's like Booth died.

27:21.736 --> 27:24.104
In a sense, he has, you know?

27:24.138 --> 27:26.673
He... he doesn't know
where he fits in anymore.

27:26.708 --> 27:28.108
He-he doesn't have an anchor.

27:28.142 --> 27:31.044
Faith in something
greater than himself.

27:33.014 --> 27:34.548
That's good.

27:34.582 --> 27:37.184
Watch out, or you'll turn
into a psychologist.

27:38.086 --> 27:39.553
Look, Booth is-is

27:39.587 --> 27:41.822
afraid of trusting again--
it's natural.

27:41.856 --> 27:44.691
We just need to show him
it's a risk worth taking.

27:47.362 --> 27:49.496
You're gonna be
a good father, Sweets.

27:49.530 --> 27:50.597
You are.

27:50.632 --> 27:51.865
Come on.

27:53.101 --> 27:55.369
The night that Cooper
came into the E.R.

27:55.403 --> 27:56.737
for his "fall down the stairs,"

27:56.771 --> 27:58.772
there was a homeless man
who was brought in,

27:58.806 --> 28:00.140
who had been in a car accident.

28:00.174 --> 28:01.608
He was the victim
of a hit-and-run.

28:01.643 --> 28:04.511
He died on the
operating table.

28:04.545 --> 28:07.314
The attending physician
was Durant.

28:10.485 --> 28:13.349
BOOTH: You lied to me, Durant.
Agent Booth.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.004
There was another
car accident victim

28:15.004 --> 28:17.095
that came in that night--
the same night as Cooper.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.800
You treated them both.
It was so long ago,

28:18.801 --> 28:20.127
why can't we just forget about it?
Why?

28:20.161 --> 28:22.129
Because Howard Cooper was
murdered; and if you don't talk,

28:22.163 --> 28:24.398
I'm gonna find a way
to pin that on you, too.

28:24.432 --> 28:26.199
I don't know anything
about any murder.

28:26.234 --> 28:28.301
W-With Cooper, I-I just...
I didn't have any choice.

28:28.336 --> 28:29.936
Right, 'cause you
were blackmailed.

28:29.971 --> 28:31.505
How did you know?

28:31.539 --> 28:33.540
Not important;
just talk.

28:33.574 --> 28:36.877
They had security footage
of me stealing oxycodone

28:36.911 --> 28:38.111
from the hospital pharmacy.

28:38.146 --> 28:40.447
I was selling it
to pay for med school.

28:40.481 --> 28:41.481
"They."

28:41.516 --> 28:42.649
Who is "they"?

28:42.684 --> 28:43.784
I don't know.

28:43.818 --> 28:45.952
When Cooper came in,
I got a message

28:45.987 --> 28:48.355
from a nurse that I'd never
seen before, and she said

28:48.389 --> 28:50.123
that they had pictures,
and that they could ruin me.

28:50.158 --> 28:51.992
So you killed the homeless guy?

28:52.026 --> 28:54.528
No. My God, no. He-he had
massive internal bleeding.

28:54.562 --> 28:56.196
And... they didn't care
about him.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.565
They wanted to hold
the hit-and-run over Cooper

28:58.599 --> 29:01.735
so that they could force him
to do what they wanted.

29:03.304 --> 29:04.671
Believe me,
a day hasn't gone by

29:04.706 --> 29:07.607
that I haven't regretted
what I did.

29:07.642 --> 29:09.876
But I didn't have a choice.
I'm sorry.

29:09.911 --> 29:11.912
I'm so sorry.

29:15.829 --> 29:18.430
Foster's chip had
over 1,800 images on it

29:18.431 --> 29:20.599
of people I couldn't identify,

29:20.633 --> 29:24.269
but now that we have a point
of comparison, I can try to...

29:24.303 --> 29:25.404
That was fast.

29:25.438 --> 29:28.106
Well, it's definitely Durant.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.645
21 years ago.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.914
He was telling the truth.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.016
Yeah, but it still doesn't tell
us who was blackmailing him,

29:38.051 --> 29:39.411
just that Durant was
a victim, too.

29:39.419 --> 29:40.619
Hey, Durant
covered up a crime.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.054
I wouldn't call
him a victim.

29:42.088 --> 29:44.289
I'd say he was part
of the conspiracy.

29:44.323 --> 29:47.292
Is there any way to find out who
had access to the surveillance?

29:47.326 --> 29:48.894
Sure, yeah.
I mean, if we find out

29:48.928 --> 29:50.896
who was in charge of security,
we might find out

29:50.930 --> 29:52.097
who he passed the footage to.

29:52.131 --> 29:53.699
Well, the odds are against us.

29:53.733 --> 29:55.801
21 years ago, these systems
weren't digitally coded

29:55.835 --> 29:56.968
or watermarked.

29:57.003 --> 29:58.937
Well, we don't have much else.

29:58.971 --> 30:01.606
Based on the injuries to the
hamate and the triquetral bones,

30:01.641 --> 30:03.408
we have evidence
of a struggle,

30:03.443 --> 30:05.143
but nothing on the bones
that indicates a weapon.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.345
No, that's not
true, Dr. Edison.

30:07.380 --> 30:10.949
There is a scratch on
the spinal process of the C-7.

30:10.983 --> 30:13.418
It doesn't appear
in your notes though.

30:13.453 --> 30:15.854
(sighs)
Well, I guess I missed that.

30:15.888 --> 30:17.155
It was obscured

30:17.190 --> 30:18.557
by the discoloration

30:18.591 --> 30:21.493
from the victim's
leukemia medication.

30:23.396 --> 30:24.996
There appears to be
slight hemorrhagic staining.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.465
Yes.

30:26.499 --> 30:29.935
Perimortem-- has to be
related to his death.

30:30.870 --> 30:34.272
Question is: what caused it?

30:34.307 --> 30:36.374
Well, we know he was
in the hospital.

30:36.409 --> 30:38.477
So maybe... a syringe?

30:38.511 --> 30:41.446
It would be an
18-gauge needle.

30:41.481 --> 30:43.315
Far too large
for a standard syringe.

30:43.349 --> 30:45.517
But it would
correspond to the size

30:45.551 --> 30:47.819
of a wide-gauge needle
used for an I.V. line.

30:47.854 --> 30:49.888
That's definitely a possibility.

30:49.922 --> 30:52.958
Why would an I.V. needle
be inserted into his neck?

30:52.992 --> 30:54.326
It was unintentional.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.861
That's why there are
also scratches

30:55.895 --> 30:57.929
on the clavicle
and left scapula.

30:57.964 --> 30:59.164
Cooper saw that
someone was about

30:59.198 --> 31:00.699
to inject something
into his I.V.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.001
And he knew that someone
was trying to kill him;

31:03.035 --> 31:04.169
that's why he fought back.

31:04.203 --> 31:05.303
And during the struggle,

31:05.338 --> 31:07.239
the killer tried
to jab the needle

31:07.273 --> 31:09.574
into Cooper wherever he could.

31:09.609 --> 31:11.409
But if a toxin was
injected into Cooper,

31:11.444 --> 31:14.146
why didn't it show up
on the tox screen?

31:36.769 --> 31:38.370
(sighs)

31:38.404 --> 31:39.538
(whispers):
Sorry.

31:39.572 --> 31:41.373
I didn't mean to wake you.

31:41.407 --> 31:44.276
She... (grunts)
She fell asleep.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.714
She's so happy you're back.

32:01.694 --> 32:03.061
Did you find out anything?

32:03.095 --> 32:05.397
I think Cooper was
poisoned somehow.

32:05.431 --> 32:06.832
But we have to
freeze the marrow

32:06.866 --> 32:10.068
before I can do
an immunohistologic study.

32:11.270 --> 32:12.204
A what?

32:12.238 --> 32:13.238
Wait, Bones.

32:13.272 --> 32:14.506
Why is this taking so long?

32:14.540 --> 32:16.141
It's only the second day, Booth.

32:16.175 --> 32:20.111
Every day gives Sanderson
more time to protect himself...

32:20.146 --> 32:21.947
(knocking)

32:21.981 --> 32:23.748
Who the hell's that?

32:26.586 --> 32:28.153
The hell are you doing here?

32:28.187 --> 32:31.089
Sweets sent me.

32:31.123 --> 32:34.793
Can I come in? Kind of feel
like a salesman standing here.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.394
BRENNAN:
Yes.

32:36.429 --> 32:38.096
Come in.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.365
I'm Special Agent Aubrey.

32:40.399 --> 32:42.767
Uh, James, Jimmy--
I answer to anything.

32:42.802 --> 32:44.302
Dr. Brennan.
I know.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.838
And I'm duly impressed.

32:48.441 --> 32:49.708
Oh, that is adorable.

32:49.742 --> 32:51.843
I got to get one of those.
Aubrey.

32:51.878 --> 32:54.112
Look, Sweets has you working
on this case?

32:54.146 --> 32:56.281
Yeah, because he's not
like you; he trusts me.

32:56.315 --> 32:58.083
I was trying to
track who had access

32:58.117 --> 33:00.352
to the surveillance tapes.

33:00.386 --> 33:02.387
The head of security
at Bethesda Presbyterian

33:02.421 --> 33:04.055
was a guy named Jerold Norsky.

33:04.090 --> 33:05.957
He went to work for a
company called Unitech

33:05.992 --> 33:08.593
three years after catching
Durant in the pharmacy.

33:08.628 --> 33:12.030
Unitech is a subsidiary
of Sanderson Chemical.

33:12.064 --> 33:13.131
This is good.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.666
And bad.

33:14.700 --> 33:16.768
When I told Stark about
the connection to Sanderson,

33:16.802 --> 33:18.795
he pulled me off the case.

33:18.796 --> 33:19.497
What?

33:19.521 --> 33:20.772
Said we were on a
fishing expedition

33:20.773 --> 33:22.974
that was pissing off
some very important people.

33:23.009 --> 33:24.876
Sanderson must be making
more threats.

33:24.911 --> 33:26.871
AUBREY: I wasn't supposed
to tell you any of this,

33:26.879 --> 33:29.714
so maybe you could just say
I came by to see your kid.

33:29.749 --> 33:31.516
Look, where's Norsky now?

33:31.550 --> 33:33.251
He retired--
he's got to be 85 now.

33:33.286 --> 33:34.886
I'm still trying
to track him down.

33:34.921 --> 33:36.788
So if I get fired,
it's your fault.

33:40.826 --> 33:42.527
SAROYAN:
<i>No, this is my lab,</i>

33:42.561 --> 33:44.763
and those remains
are my responsibility.

33:44.797 --> 33:46.364
Not anymore, ma'am.
We have a court order.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.799
Which I'd like
to peruse,<i> Cher.</i>

33:47.833 --> 33:48.833
What's going on?
They're here

33:48.868 --> 33:50.568
to take Cooper's remains.

33:50.603 --> 33:52.504
They can't take them!
We have the exhumation order.

33:52.538 --> 33:53.972
They found
a family member who says

33:54.006 --> 33:55.840
Cooper's remains
are being defiled.

33:55.875 --> 33:57.642
She wants him reburied
immediately.

33:57.677 --> 34:00.612
Until a judge rules,
we can't touch Cooper.

34:00.646 --> 34:01.746
Could you show us
where the remains are?

34:01.781 --> 34:04.049
No. No.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.083
If you resist
or interfere in any way,

34:05.117 --> 34:06.251
you will be arrested.

34:07.820 --> 34:09.688
It's not gonna help anyone
if you're in jail.

34:09.722 --> 34:10.822
In there,

34:10.856 --> 34:12.524
on the table.
Yes, ma'am.

34:12.558 --> 34:15.293
You know what
you've just given up?

34:15.328 --> 34:16.928
Those remains are all we have.

34:16.963 --> 34:18.996
MAN:
Make sure you get them all.

34:19.031 --> 34:21.533
I don't want any left behind.

34:21.567 --> 34:23.601
I'm sorry,<i> Cherie.</i>
There's nothing we can do.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.327
BRENNAN:
<i>We don't have time for more</i>

34:29.360 --> 34:30.661
<i>conspiracy theories,</i>
<i>Dr. Hodgins.</i>

34:30.696 --> 34:32.297
Dr. Edison and I
are trying to decide

34:32.331 --> 34:34.331
how to proceed with the case
with just X-rays.

34:34.366 --> 34:36.701
I wouldn't worry. They took Cooper's
bones, Dr. Hodgins.

34:36.735 --> 34:38.870
They took 206 bones, yes.

34:38.904 --> 34:40.338
But not all of them
were Cooper's.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.572
But I saw them.

34:41.607 --> 34:43.174
They-they were discolored
and cancerous.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.376
Well, Cooper's not the only
37-year-old male

34:45.411 --> 34:47.078
to suffer from leukemia.

34:47.112 --> 34:49.781
You replaced the bones we needed
with ones from limbo?

34:49.815 --> 34:52.250
How-how did you know
they'd come for Cooper?

34:52.284 --> 34:53.324
There's a conspiracy here.

34:53.351 --> 34:54.652
Now, whatever is crucial to us

34:54.687 --> 34:56.087
we must consider
crucial to them.

34:56.121 --> 34:57.355
So I've been playing defense

34:57.389 --> 34:59.224
ever since Cooper's body
was brought in.

34:59.258 --> 35:01.559
I made sure
the bones were frozen

35:01.594 --> 35:03.661
per the immunohistological
protocol.

35:04.797 --> 35:06.397
BRENNAN:
The bones are still brittle.

35:06.432 --> 35:09.400
I'll need a laser
to slice sections

35:09.435 --> 35:11.169
we can put under
the electron microscope.

35:11.203 --> 35:13.438
That way, we can see
if there were toxins

35:13.472 --> 35:16.641
that changed the cellular makeup
of the marrow.

35:16.675 --> 35:19.277
The marrow would already be
compromised from the leukemia.

35:19.311 --> 35:22.647
But an outside toxin could alter
the damage done by the cancer.

35:22.681 --> 35:24.782
Swab from the scratch on the C-7
showed traces of

35:24.817 --> 35:27.552
"C10, H16, N6, S..."

35:27.586 --> 35:28.920
This is pretty benign.

35:28.954 --> 35:31.022
It's definitely not a toxin.

35:31.056 --> 35:32.323
It's a cimetidine derivative.

35:32.358 --> 35:34.626
Some kind of
H2-receptor antagonist.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.461
Why would the assailant inject
the victim with an antacid?

35:36.495 --> 35:38.196
BRENNAN: Actually,
it's quite ingenious.

35:38.230 --> 35:40.031
Wouldn't the cimetidine

35:40.065 --> 35:42.200
interact with
the vinca alkaloids

35:42.234 --> 35:45.270
in the chemo drugs
that Cooper was getting?

35:45.304 --> 35:47.071
My God, you're right.

35:47.106 --> 35:48.706
That would make a standard
chemo treatment lethal.

35:48.741 --> 35:50.174
And the cimetidine has

35:50.209 --> 35:52.777
a half-life of two hours
once it's metabolized.

35:52.811 --> 35:54.545
Which explains why it didn't
show up in the adipocere.

35:54.580 --> 35:56.340
It's a brilliant way
to get away with murder.

35:56.348 --> 35:58.383
Except, I don't intend for him
to get away with it.

36:05.591 --> 36:08.493
Stark doesn't know,
but I found Norsky.

36:08.527 --> 36:11.162
He's in a nursing home
in Abingdon, Virginia.

36:11.196 --> 36:12.897
You trust me, yet?

36:12.932 --> 36:14.666
Don't push it.

36:15.601 --> 36:17.502
(clears throat)

36:17.536 --> 36:19.270
Norsky made the
rounds, huh?

36:19.305 --> 36:23.675
Worked for Sanderson, McNamara,
a couple of congressmen...

36:23.709 --> 36:25.476
The facility he's in is
pretty ritzy-- not the kind

36:25.511 --> 36:27.745
of place a security guy
could afford on his own.

36:29.481 --> 36:30.548
It's good work.

36:30.582 --> 36:32.317
I thought so.

36:32.351 --> 36:35.420
Maybe when this is all over, you
could put in a good word for me.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.755
You're bringing that up now?

36:37.790 --> 36:39.123
I got dreams.

36:39.158 --> 36:40.491
What can I say?

36:40.526 --> 36:42.593
(cell phone ringing)

36:42.628 --> 36:43.761
Bones.

36:43.796 --> 36:45.229
BRENNAN:
We know what killed Cooper.

36:45.264 --> 36:46.331
It was an antacid.

36:46.365 --> 36:48.366
What, he ate too many Tums?

36:48.400 --> 36:50.201
It was an experimental formula
that turned out to be dangerous.

36:50.235 --> 36:51.202
The FDA wouldn't approve it,

36:51.236 --> 36:53.471
but the killer had to know

36:53.505 --> 36:56.207
that it would interact with
Cooper's chemo medicine.

36:56.241 --> 36:57.709
Look, then who was the killer?

36:57.743 --> 37:00.511
It was developed
by Sanderson Chemical.

37:00.546 --> 37:02.647
This warrant will get you all
the documents Sanderson has

37:02.681 --> 37:04.515
relating to the drug, its
testing, who had access to it,

37:04.550 --> 37:05.817
everything.

37:05.851 --> 37:07.251
All right, I got it.
No, I got it.

37:07.286 --> 37:08.987
No!
I can pick up a few documents.

37:09.021 --> 37:11.155
We need to talk to the
security guy, Jerold Norsky.

37:11.190 --> 37:13.458
Norsky? I'm gonna be in
that area. Let me do this.

37:13.492 --> 37:14.525
It's fine.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.560
Move fast,<i> Cher.</i>

37:15.594 --> 37:17.028
This is
a Cinderella warrant.

37:17.062 --> 37:18.963
When Sanderson's attorneys
find out about it,

37:18.998 --> 37:20.131
it'll turn
into a pumpkin.

37:20.165 --> 37:22.533
Great. Finally get
to use my siren.

37:24.837 --> 37:28.606
A privilege to work
for the Bureau, isn't it, son?

37:28.640 --> 37:30.241
Yeah, uh...

37:30.275 --> 37:32.643
We just have a few questions
we need to ask you.

37:32.678 --> 37:34.912
Have I shown you my badge?

37:34.947 --> 37:38.516
Well, that there actually is,
uh-- sorry-- my badge, sir.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.218
(laughs):
Oh, yes.

37:40.252 --> 37:41.886
I'm sorry.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.122
So you worked security at
Bethesda Presbyterian Hospital,

37:44.156 --> 37:46.290
didn't you?

37:46.325 --> 37:47.825
I was assigned there, yes.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.661
A... great honor to be chosen.

37:50.696 --> 37:54.599
You go where
Mr. Hoover sends you.

37:54.633 --> 37:55.933
J. Edgar Hoover?

37:55.968 --> 37:57.402
You were with the Bureau?

37:57.436 --> 37:59.337
Yes.

37:59.371 --> 38:02.473
Mr. Hoover called me
a great soldier.

38:02.508 --> 38:04.542
That's why I was chosen.

38:04.576 --> 38:06.511
When Hoover was
in charge of the FBI,

38:06.545 --> 38:08.446
he had secret files
on politicians,

38:08.480 --> 38:10.715
business leaders,
political activists...

38:10.749 --> 38:11.682
I-I know, Bones.

38:11.717 --> 38:13.017
All that stuff was supposed

38:13.052 --> 38:14.218
to have been destroyed
after he died.

38:14.253 --> 38:16.387
Did he send you?

38:16.422 --> 38:18.389
Did Mr. Hoover send you?

38:18.424 --> 38:21.125
No, we're here because...
Yes, actually.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.593
Agent Booth is just
being cautious.

38:22.628 --> 38:26.030
We are updating
Mr. Hoover's files.

38:27.132 --> 38:29.367
And Director Hoover
wants to know

38:29.401 --> 38:31.369
about the operations
that you were involved in...

38:31.403 --> 38:32.703
For a possible
commendation.

38:32.738 --> 38:34.138
Oh.

38:34.173 --> 38:36.507
Possibly we could start
with Hugo Sanderson.

38:36.542 --> 38:38.476
A great patriot-- Mr. Sanderson.

38:38.510 --> 38:39.677
(cell phone ringing)

38:39.711 --> 38:42.513
It was a privilege
to work with him.

38:43.449 --> 38:44.682
Booth.

38:44.716 --> 38:45.983
Whoa, whoa. Okay.

38:46.018 --> 38:47.985
Just slow down, Aubrey.
What happened?

38:48.020 --> 38:49.454
What? Yeah, yeah.

38:49.488 --> 38:51.055
Yeah. We-we got to go now.

38:55.494 --> 38:59.030
(tires screeching)

38:59.064 --> 39:01.065
AUBREY: There was a
report of a gunshot,

39:01.100 --> 39:03.067
I knew he was here, so...

39:03.102 --> 39:05.136
Where is he?

39:05.170 --> 39:06.337
Sweets!
What happened?

39:06.371 --> 39:07.371
I don't know, I don't know.

39:07.406 --> 39:08.940
The paramedics
are on their way.

39:08.974 --> 39:10.775
Sweets, just relax;
you're gonna be okay.

39:10.809 --> 39:13.077
Booth.

39:13.112 --> 39:14.979
Yeah, I'm right here.
Don't move.

39:16.515 --> 39:18.850
He's not shot. I thought
you said there were gunshots.

39:18.884 --> 39:20.051
That was me, actually.

39:20.085 --> 39:21.686
You?
I sh him

39:21.720 --> 39:23.754
He was hit in the nasion,
the philtrum

39:23.789 --> 39:24.989
and the sternum, Booth.

39:26.859 --> 39:30.228
Looks like massive
internal trauma.

39:30.262 --> 39:32.563
He's bleeding
out, Booth.

39:32.598 --> 39:34.232
Tell Daisy not to worry.

39:34.266 --> 39:35.666
She worries too much.

39:35.701 --> 39:37.735
Of course.

39:37.769 --> 39:39.203
Don't talk now, Sweets.

39:39.238 --> 39:40.938
(sighs)

39:40.973 --> 39:43.541
I fought... I fought back.

39:43.575 --> 39:46.511
You'd be proud.

39:46.545 --> 39:48.746
Sweets, don't talk. Why are you
talking all the time?

39:48.780 --> 39:50.248
Bones said don't talk.

39:50.282 --> 39:53.017
He... he got the document.

39:53.051 --> 39:54.919
Doesn't matter right now.

39:54.953 --> 39:57.121
You're gonna be fine.

39:58.657 --> 40:01.325
You, too.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.729
The world is a lot better
than you think it is.

40:04.763 --> 40:07.031
It's...

40:20.445 --> 40:21.879
N-No. No, no.

40:21.914 --> 40:23.548
You-you can start talking now,
Sweets. Come on.

40:23.582 --> 40:26.551
He's gone, Booth.

40:26.585 --> 40:27.919
(sirens approaching)

40:27.953 --> 40:28.953
He's gone.

40:28.987 --> 40:29.987
No, no. No, no. No.

40:30.022 --> 40:32.290
Come on, Sweets.

40:34.893 --> 40:36.460
Hey!

40:36.495 --> 40:38.963
Hey, hey, hey.
Sweets!

40:38.997 --> 40:40.298
Sweets.

41:23.842 --> 41:26.544
Daisy, I-I don't think
you should be here right now.

41:26.578 --> 41:28.546
But I can help.

41:28.580 --> 41:29.981
I have to help.

41:30.015 --> 41:31.816
Of course.

41:37.889 --> 41:40.324
You have to sign
for these remains.

41:46.298 --> 41:48.366
Hodgins, can you give me a hand?

42:33.011 --> 42:36.781
I don't... know
if I can do this to him.

42:41.887 --> 42:43.554
You can.

42:43.588 --> 42:46.457
This is not Sweets,

42:46.491 --> 42:48.959
this is a set of remains

42:48.994 --> 42:51.862
that will give us the man
who killed Sweets.
