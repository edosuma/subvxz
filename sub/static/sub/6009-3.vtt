00:34.743 --> 00:37.204
Should we give them
some more space between the beds?

00:37.287 --> 00:39.289
Well, we could give them...
Not much.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.917
I'm determined to defend the library
as a recreation room.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.502
Where are we to sit?

00:43.669 --> 00:45.504
We can screen off the small library.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.005
- Is that all?
- I suppose...

00:47.089 --> 00:49.967
Or we could leave you the boudoir. I
wanted to put the intermediaries in there,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.677
but we don't have to.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.803
How kind.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.306
Why will we only have officers?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.475
Surely all wounded men need to convalesce.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.143
The hospital is for officers

01:00.227 --> 01:03.146
and the whole idea is to have
a complementary convalescent home.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.900
Of course. But I don't know
if we can make that an absolute rule.

01:07.109 --> 01:09.862
If the world were logical,
I would rather agree with you.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.572
Which comes as no surprise.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.657
You would not, I imagine.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.701
You imagine right.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.745
What these men will need
is rest and relaxation.

01:19.705 --> 01:23.750
Will that be achieved by mixing ranks
and putting everyone on edge?

01:28.672 --> 01:29.965
- Granny.
- Mmm...

01:30.048 --> 01:32.968
Different ranks can relax together.
It has been known.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.762
Well, don't look at me.
I'm very good at mixing.

01:35.846 --> 01:39.933
We always danced the first waltz
at the Servants' Ball, didn't we, Carson?

01:40.017 --> 01:41.143
It was an honor, milady.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.605
It's a lot to ask
when people aren't at their best.

01:46.190 --> 01:50.152
I'm searching for Lady Mary, Carson.
Will you tell her I'm in the library?

01:51.904 --> 01:53.906
Don't loiter, Edith
. There's plenty to be done.

01:53.989 --> 01:57.993
- Of course, but I'm not quite sure what...
- Sybil, I wanted to have a quick word...

02:02.789 --> 02:05.626
I'm going down to the village
this afternoon if anyone wants anything.

02:05.709 --> 02:09.378
Some stamps would be kind,
I'll get you the money.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.007
I'd like to thank you all
for your work this morning.

02:12.341 --> 02:15.344
It's so strange to see the rooms
converted into dormitories.

02:15.427 --> 02:18.138
But good.
It was wrong for our life to chug along

02:18.222 --> 02:20.057
as if the war
were only happening to other people.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.268
How will it be, though?
Are we all working for Mrs Crawley now?

02:23.393 --> 02:24.686
We are not!

02:25.020 --> 02:28.482
I'm sure the chain of command
will be sorted out soon.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.150
Or there'll be blood on the stairs.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.069
Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.909
But what do you think it meant?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.912
Really, Granny,
Lavinia Swire knows Richard Carlisle.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.706
So what?
One knows lots of people in London.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.085
I don't know many people
who'd threaten me behind the laurels.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.797
Aunt Rosamund said herself
she didn't know what to make of it.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.425
I still think it's a peculiar way
for a gentleman to speak to a lady.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.469
At least you think him a gentleman.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.681
The point is, do you
think he's a gentleman?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.934
I'm not sure it matters much to me.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.647
Well, I'm going up to London
to stay with Rosamund for a day or two.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.649
I think we'll have Lavinia for tea.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.193
You sound as if
you're going to gobble her up.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.529
If only we could.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.741
But where are they going to eat?

03:20.075 --> 03:23.203
I understand from Mrs Crawley
that they'll share the dining room

03:23.287 --> 03:25.205
with the officers who are almost well.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.417
So am I running a canteen now?

03:29.418 --> 03:30.752
William says he's got time off

03:30.836 --> 03:33.046
between the end of his training
and going overseas.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.174
He'll be with his father, surely?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.010
He's going home first, but he wants
to come here for his last night.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.221
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, Mr Carson?

03:41.305 --> 03:44.683
Certainly not.
I'd be glad to wish him well on his way.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.059
Oh, for you, Mr Branson.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.649
Why do you think he's coming here?

03:53.317 --> 03:55.611
To see us all and say goodbye.
What's wrong with that?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.613
But suppose it's something more.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.281
Suppose he's got plans.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.992
Well, you have to deal with that
when it happens.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.328
And mind you deal fair.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.539
Now go and grate that suet
before I grow old and die.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.453
Who will be in charge?

04:46.537 --> 04:48.288
Cousin Isobel thinks it'll be her.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.458
All I know is that
she'll drive us mad before the end...

04:52.334 --> 04:54.962
- I'm going up to change.
- I just want to finish this.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.842
Aren't you going to the hospital?
Not yet.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.928
I'm on a night shift.
I'll walk down after dinner.

05:04.263 --> 05:07.474
- And please don't start lecturing me.
- I won't.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.060
The truth is I envy you.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.273
Do you ever miss helping out
on the Drakes' farm?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.024
That's a funny question.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.069
- Why?
- NO reason.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.780
It's just you seemed
to have such a purpose there.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.408
It suited you.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.034
It did suit me.

05:26.410 --> 05:30.497
I enjoyed it, but now I
feel like a spare part.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.165
Trust me.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.209
You have a talent
that none of the rest of us have.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.130
Just find out what it is and use it.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.048
It's doing nothing that's the enemy.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.725
The truth is, milady, Mrs Crawley
has forgotten this is your house.

05:50.726 --> 05:54.021
And we need a friend in charge
of the day-to-day management.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.357
Because if Mrs Crawley
gets one of her toadies in to run things,

05:57.524 --> 06:00.235
she'll have her nose in every pie
before you can say Jack Robinson.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.361
But who?

06:03.322 --> 06:04.740
What about Thomas, milady?

06:06.074 --> 06:09.244
He's hospital trained and he's
always had a soft spot for Downton.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.164
Thomas, the footman?

06:12.831 --> 06:14.208
Managing Downton Abbey?

06:14.583 --> 06:16.335
But he's not a footman, now, is he?

06:16.752 --> 06:20.672
He's a Corporal,
with real battle experience as a medic.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.341
Could Doctor Clarkson spare him?

06:22.966 --> 06:26.053
Well, I suppose
he'll have to spare somebody...

06:34.061 --> 06:35.562
Are you all right?

06:35.646 --> 06:37.606
You seem a bit preoccupied.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.944
I had a... No, never mind.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.904
What?

06:46.949 --> 06:49.243
It was this afternoon, in the village.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.038
I thought I saw Mr Bates.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.249
Bates? Isn't he in London?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.335
I might have been wrong.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.963
I walked over to where he was standing
and there was no sign of him.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.048
Do you know his address in London?

07:03.131 --> 07:05.509
As long as he's still there. Why?

07:05.592 --> 07:08.887
I'll telephone Sir Richard
and ask him to look into it.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.305
But what would he know?

07:10.389 --> 07:12.140
He works in newspapers,

07:12.224 --> 07:15.853
a world of spies, tip-offs
and private investigators.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.856
I promise you,
he can find out whatever he likes.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.317
All right, then. If you think he can help.

07:22.734 --> 07:23.986
Good.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.446
I'll ring him tonight.

07:27.614 --> 07:31.159
Not bad. Try to fit in a bit of practice.

07:31.243 --> 07:35.163
We've plenty of time to get it right before
there's anyone to see me who matters.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.962
I only know Sir Richard because he is...

07:42.045 --> 07:47.050
Or was, a friend of my father's
and of my uncle, Jonathan Swire.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.887
The Liberal minister?
That's it.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.349
- But I'm afraid they've fallen out.
- Oh.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.813
This room is so pretty.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.690
Has the house always been
the Painswicks' London home?

08:01.773 --> 08:04.610
There's no "always"
about the Painswicks, my dear.

08:04.693 --> 08:08.238
They were invented from scratch
by my son-in-law's grandfather.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.282
We bought the house when we were married.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.161
You make Mr Painswick sound
rather a rough diamond, Lady Grantham.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.289
Marmaduke wasn't a rough diamond,
was he, Mama?

08:17.372 --> 08:20.542
No. He was just out and polished
comparatively recently.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.467
Carson's told Papa you've been called up.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.136
There's no need to look so serious.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.472
You'd think me rather
heartless if I didn't.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.390
I'm not going to fight.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.644
- You'll have to.
- I will not.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.562
I'm going to be a "conscientious objector".

08:41.188 --> 08:42.606
They'll put you in prison.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.067
I'd rather prison than the Dardanelles.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.487
- When will you tell them?
- In my own good time.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.533
I don't understand.

08:54.243 --> 08:58.455
I'll go to the medical, I'll report
for duty and when on parade,

08:58.539 --> 09:01.208
I'll march out front
and I'll shout it loud and clear.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.545
And if that doesn't make the newspapers,
then I'm a monkey's uncle.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.006
But you'll have a record
for the rest of your life.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.760
At least I'll have a life.

09:16.682 --> 09:20.769
I know the popular fantasy
is that you can feed six strong men from

09:21.770 --> 09:24.481
...a single seed cake,
but you and I know better.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.233
Have we got the flour for any more?

09:26.316 --> 09:28.026
Go and check now. Right.

09:32.406 --> 09:35.701
Cheer up. It's not as bad as that.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.954
What's the matter, Mr Lang?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.623
Tell me. I won't bite.

09:44.084 --> 09:48.005
I sometimes feel I'm the only one
who knows what's going on over there.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.843
You all wander around ironing clothes
and cleaning boots

09:52.926 --> 09:56.305
and choosing what's for dinner,
while, over the Channel,

09:56.388 --> 09:59.224
men are killed and maimed

10:00.225 --> 10:01.518
and blown to pieces.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.312
We know more than you think.

10:04.021 --> 10:07.983
The war hasn't left us alone, it hasn't
left me alone, however it may look.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.861
Have you any idea

10:12.196 --> 10:13.614
how scared they are?

10:14.865 --> 10:17.284
How scared they all are?

10:19.870 --> 10:21.872
I lost my nephew,

10:22.581 --> 10:23.957
my sister's boy.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.251
He was shot...

10:28.337 --> 10:29.463
for cowardice.

10:31.423 --> 10:32.758
That's what they said.

10:33.634 --> 10:37.137
But I knew him
and he'd never have done such a thing

10:38.305 --> 10:40.807
if he hadn't been
half out of his mind with fear.

10:42.518 --> 10:43.852
Don't blame him.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.272
It was him, but it could have been me.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.736
It could have been any of us.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.535
Suppose
I don't want to come back?

10:59.618 --> 11:02.579
To be in charge?
Telling Mr Carson what to do?

11:04.456 --> 11:05.832
Why? What's in it for you?

11:07.084 --> 11:09.962
All right. It's to stop Mrs Crawley
bossing Her Ladyship about.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.798
She behaves as if she owns the place.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.383
You've changed your tune.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.176
When I were last here,

11:16.260 --> 11:18.262
you'd have given money
to see Her Ladyship eat dirt.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.890
Well, like you say,
I've changed me tune. People do.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.226
Not without a reason.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.520
I've got me reasons.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.565
You've also got Her Ladyship
wrapped round your little finger.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.900
Maybe. That's my business.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.027
But I'll not hurt her,

11:34.778 --> 11:37.739
and I'll not let anyone
else hurt her, neither.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.449
That's all I've got to say.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.744
You're a queer one and no mistake.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.747
So will you come if I can fix it?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.334
Why not?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.796
I like the idea of giving
orders to old Carson.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.720
I go away for five minutes
and everything's settled.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.305
Nothing's settled.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.350
For a start, which rooms will we live in?

12:05.434 --> 12:07.477
The small library and the boudoir.

12:07.561 --> 12:11.565
If Cousin Isobel can find somewhere else
for the "intermediaries".

12:11.815 --> 12:14.818
There's always the boot room.
I'm sure you'll have use of that!

12:15.402 --> 12:17.487
And where are we supposed to eat?

12:17.571 --> 12:19.615
You can share the dining room
with those officers...

12:19.698 --> 12:20.741
No.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.410
- We all have to make sacrifices...
- No.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.121
Then we'll have tables
set up in the great hall

12:26.205 --> 12:28.415
for the mobile officers and for the nurses.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.960
And, Lady Grantham,
I know you'll be happy about one decision.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.422
Lady Grantham asked
that the house management

12:35.506 --> 12:37.549
might be put into the hands
of Corporal Barrow.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.511
Your former footman, Thomas.

12:41.637 --> 12:44.097
Thomas? In charge of Downton?

12:44.348 --> 12:48.268
No, that's what I thought at first.
But he isn't a footman now. He's a soldier.

12:48.519 --> 12:49.978
He's worked in medicine.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.856
The point is, someone has to run the place
who's had medical training.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.191
But I really feel...

12:54.274 --> 12:56.401
The men won't accept
the authority of a corporal.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.861
I've thought of that.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.238
I told my Commanding Officer

12:59.321 --> 13:01.990
that Lady Grantham
had asked for Corporal Barrow

13:02.449 --> 13:05.077
and he's prepared to have him raised
to the rank of Acting Sergeant.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.120
- But can you spare him?
- We can.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.332
I've gone to some trouble to do so.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.918
Sergeant Barrow will manage
the daily running of Downton

13:13.335 --> 13:14.920
and I shall be in overall charge.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.381
But you have the hospital.
Aren't we missing a tier?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.841
Surely there should be
someone here permanently

13:18.924 --> 13:20.384
who is under you but over Thomas?

13:20.467 --> 13:23.220
That's correct,
and I will make a decision before long.

13:24.096 --> 13:27.933
Until then, I do assure you,
Corporal Barrow is very efficient.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.686
I say good.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.731
If someone's to manage things,
let it be our creature.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.359
Why? Are you planning
to divide his loyalties?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.737
I wouldn't say I was planning it.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.784
William has asked
to stay here, milord, just for a night.

13:45.868 --> 13:49.371
On his way to active duty in France.
Good. I should like to see him.

13:50.122 --> 13:53.709
I don't suppose there's any way
we can keep him from harm?

13:53.792 --> 13:55.878
Him being an only child and all.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.339
We'd hate for anything to happen.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.341
Thank you, Lang. I can do the rest.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.428
Very sorry, milord.

14:10.225 --> 14:14.229
To get back to the notion of Thomas
as the manager of Downton.

14:14.313 --> 14:18.775
He won't be a manager in that sense.
But Her Ladyship fixed it all with Clarkson

14:18.859 --> 14:21.528
and she was so pleased
I didn't know what to say.

14:21.612 --> 14:25.282
"I cannot have him working here
because he is a thief."

14:25.365 --> 14:30.078
You know she's ignorant of Thomas' crimes.
We agreed at the time that would be best.

14:30.871 --> 14:35.501
And anyway, is it honorable in us
to hold Thomas' sins against him

14:35.584 --> 14:38.086
when he has been wounded
in the service of the King?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.631
And who is to be in charge over Thomas?

14:41.965 --> 14:43.926
You mean under Dr Clarkson?

14:44.009 --> 14:46.803
Well, we asked today,
but he hasn't decided.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.847
So we just make it up as we go along?

14:50.265 --> 14:52.100
Unless you've got a better idea.

14:57.356 --> 14:58.815
Are you still here, Mr Branson?

14:58.899 --> 15:00.901
Why don't you stay
and have something to eat?

15:00.984 --> 15:03.570
Mr Branson's been telling us
the news from Russia.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.030
What news is that?

15:05.239 --> 15:09.117
Kerensky's been made Prime Minister,
but he won't go far enough for me.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.954
Lenin denounces the bourgeoisie
along with the Tsar.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.332
He wants a people's revolution
and that's what I'm waiting for.

15:16.124 --> 15:19.044
- It won't be long now.
- And what's happened to the Tsar?

15:19.127 --> 15:22.840
Imprisoned in the Alexander Palace
with all his family.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.508
What a dreadful thing.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.969
They won't hurt them. Why would they?

15:27.636 --> 15:29.012
To make an example?

15:29.096 --> 15:33.892
Give them some credit. This is a
new dawn, a new age of government.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.646
No one wants to start it
with the murder of a bunch of young girls.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.356
You don't know that.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.734
Nobody knows who'll get killed
when these things start.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.612
Look at her nephew. Shot for cowardice.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.074
Who'd have guessed that
when he was saying hello to the neighbors?

15:49.533 --> 15:51.618
Or kissing his mother goodnight?

15:51.994 --> 15:53.412
Can you look at the crumble?

15:53.495 --> 15:56.123
I think it should come out, but it's
five minutes earlier than you said...

16:03.005 --> 16:04.548
I'm sorry.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.926
- I never thought...
- Then you should think, Mr Lang.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.346
You're not the only member
of the walking wounded in this house.

16:37.206 --> 16:41.043
- Why are you coming in this way?
- I'm the manager here now, Mr Carson.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.128
Or had you forgotten?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.923
No. I had not forgotten.

16:46.465 --> 16:50.719
And will you be moving into your old room
or should we prepare a guest bedroom?

16:51.386 --> 16:53.222
I'll sleep in my old room, thanks.

16:55.224 --> 16:59.311
So, are we ready for the big invasion?

17:00.062 --> 17:03.565
- 'Cause they'll be here at tea time.
- We'll have to be ready, won't we, Thomas?

17:04.107 --> 17:08.654
We will, Mr Carson.
And it's Sergeant Barrow, now.

17:08.737 --> 17:11.198
"“Acting" Sergeant, I believe.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.636
Quick as you can, gentlemen.

18:18.307 --> 18:22.144
Driver, when you've finished unloading
here, go straight back to the hospital

18:22.227 --> 18:24.271
and find Orderly Wainwright...
This way, please, gentlemen.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.823
Don't worry. We'll get you seen to quickly.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.373
Major Bryant, you're in the Armada Bedroom.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.710
- Do you mind the stairs?
- It depends what I find at the top.

19:01.683 --> 19:04.061
- He's handsome.
- Handsome and off limits.

19:04.478 --> 19:06.396
It'll be nice
to have the house full of men.

19:06.522 --> 19:10.484
Full of officers. Officers aren't men.
Not where we're concerned.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.152
Oh, speak for yourself.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.988
I speak for you, too,
if you know what's good for you.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.493
I'm very sorry but I...

19:21.203 --> 19:24.581
Matthew!
What in the world are you doing here?

19:24.706 --> 19:26.917
We start our tour of Yorkshire
and Lancashire tomorrow

19:27.042 --> 19:29.837
and General Strutt knew you lived up here,
so he's given me a few hours off.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.255
What a lovely...

19:32.047 --> 19:33.257
lovely surprise.

19:33.382 --> 19:37.719
Mrs Crawley, how can we separate
the hospital's linen from our own?

19:38.428 --> 19:40.597
You go. We'll talk later.

19:41.098 --> 19:44.268
As soon as I've done this,
I'll take your orders for books.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.944
I hadn't cast you as Florence Nightingale.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.197
We can't leave
all the moral high ground to Sybil.

19:57.281 --> 19:58.866
She might get lonely there.

20:01.577 --> 20:04.830
How are you?
I know I mustn't ask you what you're doing.

20:04.955 --> 20:06.832
You can ask what I'm doing in Downton.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.584
We've finished in the Midlands

20:08.667 --> 20:10.586
and tomorrow we start on the camps
in the northern counties.

20:10.669 --> 20:13.005
Ah. Will we see something of you?

20:13.130 --> 20:14.673
I think my general ought to come here.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.050
It's exactly the sort of thing
people like to read about.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.635
Sybil...

20:18.760 --> 20:20.304
Come. Edith can do that.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.974
Dear Mother. She does
love a bit of authority.

20:24.099 --> 20:27.102
I suppose she's driving Cousin Cora mad?

20:27.186 --> 20:29.146
No names, no pack drill.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.024
Breathe in.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.986
And out.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.908
I'm surprised
they didn't get to you before now.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.327
Some people have all the luck, sir.

20:43.452 --> 20:45.287
You can get dressed.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.249
Shall I report for duty in Richmond?

20:49.333 --> 20:51.335
You'll be told what to do.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.883
But I must supervise the medical staff.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.468
Overseen by me.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.929
And, Carson, I'm relying on you
to make sure that that is so.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.514
What is going on?

21:04.389 --> 21:07.017
I was arranging the household duties.

21:07.142 --> 21:09.353
Where they overlap
with the duties of the nursing staff.

21:09.478 --> 21:11.772
Shall we continue this upstairs?

21:11.855 --> 21:14.358
Well, I've made some charts and...

21:16.985 --> 21:18.403
Of course.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.828
Did you say you were the manager?
Or the referee?

21:26.912 --> 21:30.582
- You can see what we're up against-
- Don't worry. We'll find a solution.

21:36.046 --> 21:39.299
You take over every room in the house,
you bark at me like a sergeant major

21:39.383 --> 21:41.677
- and you give orders to my servants!
- Cora, I'm sure...

21:41.760 --> 21:43.720
I'm sorry.
Are you in the middle of something?

21:44.096 --> 21:46.348
We're discussing the arrangements.

21:46.431 --> 21:49.518
Oh, good. Because we've had a letter
from Evelyn Napier.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.311
He's in a hospital in Middlesbrough

21:51.395 --> 21:53.480
and he's heard
that we're a convalescent home now,

21:53.564 --> 21:56.149
and wonders if he can come here
once he's released.

21:56.233 --> 21:57.693
Of course he can come here.

21:57.776 --> 22:00.279
- Well, now, just a minute.
- There's no question of him coming here.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.281
What? The Middlesbrough General

22:02.406 --> 22:04.825
will have their own arrangements
for where their patients convalesce.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.410
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley is right.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.996
Downton must function
as part of the official system

22:09.079 --> 22:10.664
or it cannot function at all.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.292
Now, I think perhaps
I should make one thing clear.

22:14.084 --> 22:16.211
Downton is our house and our home

22:16.295 --> 22:19.631
and we will welcome in it
any friends or relations we choose.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.675
And if you do not care
to accept that condition,

22:21.758 --> 22:24.094
then I suggest you give orders
for the nurses and the patients

22:24.178 --> 22:27.598
and the beds and the rest of it
to be packed up and shipped out at once!

22:30.767 --> 22:34.980
Thank you, Lord Grantham,
for making your position so clear.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.610
Oh, just one more thing. The dog.

22:40.485 --> 22:44.281
What should we do to stop
Isis getting into the patients' rooms?

22:44.489 --> 22:45.866
I can answer that...

22:46.533 --> 22:47.868
Absolutely nothing!

22:48.535 --> 22:49.620
Ah.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.044
Anna, there you are.
Ethel, could you leave us for a moment?

23:03.926 --> 23:05.802
That was Sir Richard on the telephone.

23:05.886 --> 23:07.888
It might have been Bates
you saw in the village.

23:09.223 --> 23:10.265
Really?

23:10.349 --> 23:13.769
He's working up here at a pub.
The Red Lion in Kirkbymoorside.

23:15.687 --> 23:16.980
That's odd.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.483
Mr Bates in a pub?

23:19.566 --> 23:22.694
The question's what'll you do
with the information now you've got it?

23:48.971 --> 23:50.430
Could you take this
into the hall for me?

23:50.514 --> 23:52.307
Of course.

23:52.391 --> 23:55.894
Are you waiting for Papa?
Do you want me to go and find him?

23:56.728 --> 23:58.480
They turned me down.

23:59.398 --> 24:00.732
The army.

24:02.776 --> 24:05.779
- Why?
- Apparently, I have a heart murmur.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.657
Or to be more precise,

24:10.409 --> 24:14.580
"A mitral valve prolapse
is causing a pansystolic murmur."

24:17.875 --> 24:20.294
I don't know what to say. Is it dangerous?

24:21.295 --> 24:23.547
Only if you're planning
to humiliate the British Army.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.800
I suppose you're glad.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.261
You're not going to be killed
and you're not going to go to prison.

24:29.344 --> 24:30.762
Of course I'm glad.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.931
Don't count your chickens.

24:33.015 --> 24:34.725
If I don't get them one way,
I'll get them another.

24:35.267 --> 24:37.728
Why do you have to be
so angry all the time?

24:38.312 --> 24:40.189
I know we weren't exactly
at our best in Ireland...

24:40.272 --> 24:41.732
"Not at your best"?

24:42.858 --> 24:44.610
"Not at your best"?

24:46.486 --> 24:49.656
I lost a cousin in the
Easter Rising last year.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.910
- You never said.
- Well, I'm saying it now.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.329
He was walking down
North King Street one day

24:55.579 --> 24:58.165
and an English soldier saw him
and shot him dead.

24:58.415 --> 25:01.126
When they asked why he was killed,
the officer said,

25:01.210 --> 25:03.504
"Because he was probably a rebel."

25:04.671 --> 25:06.673
So don't say you were "not at your best"!

25:06.757 --> 25:10.260
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
but we're going to have to step on it.

25:34.451 --> 25:38.497
I'm not sure about Marryat.
I know we've got lots of G. A. Henty.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.459
And I haven't forgotten
about your tobacco, Captain Ames.

25:42.543 --> 25:44.795
Just as soon as I can get into the village.

25:49.424 --> 25:53.011
I'm not sure at all.
I think a bit of it might have come loose.

25:55.889 --> 25:58.141
- Is that better?
- Much.

25:58.225 --> 26:00.352
But I may need some more tucking very soon.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.730
Well, no one tucks better than I do.

26:03.814 --> 26:05.566
Ethel!

26:05.649 --> 26:09.319
Go back inside, please.
There are still more bedrooms to be done.

26:22.583 --> 26:24.334
Rosamund's going to find out.

26:25.002 --> 26:27.337
She knows
some of those feeble-minded idiots

26:27.421 --> 26:28.922
on the Liberal front bench.

26:29.006 --> 26:31.091
Poor Lavinia. I feel sorry for her.

26:32.134 --> 26:36.180
She's an obstacle to your happiness, dear,
and must be removed.

26:36.346 --> 26:39.766
When it's done,
you can feel as sorry as you wish.

26:39.850 --> 26:43.645
But even if Matthew does break it off with
her, why should he propose to me again?

26:43.770 --> 26:47.274
With your permission, dear,
I will take my fences one at a time.

26:52.863 --> 26:54.948
Any plans for your afternoon off?

26:58.785 --> 27:02.372
Major Bryant wants me to go to the pictures
in York with him when he's allowed out.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.209
But you'll say that's stupid.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.795
Not stupid. Insane.

27:09.630 --> 27:11.381
Oh, he really likes me though.

27:12.299 --> 27:14.051
He says he wants to get to know me better.

27:15.052 --> 27:17.054
Has he told you
how he's planning to achieve it?

27:17.679 --> 27:19.389
Spoilsport.

27:21.475 --> 27:22.809
What are you up to?

27:23.310 --> 27:27.689
Just practicing with these for Lady Mary.
I promised her I would.

28:11.942 --> 28:14.611
That's one and eight, altogether.
There you go.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.405
Might I have a glass of cider?

28:20.450 --> 28:21.618
Thank you.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.963
I don't know if I've dreaded this moment
or longed for it.

28:36.008 --> 28:38.427
Well, either way, it's happened.

28:44.474 --> 28:47.311
I'm glad I'm in time
for tomorrow's state visit.

28:47.436 --> 28:48.812
I gather Lavinia will be there.

28:49.188 --> 28:51.481
We must seize the opportunity
to challenge her.

28:51.607 --> 28:53.567
I don't really see on what basis.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.695
She stole secrets from her uncle,
Jonathan Swire,

28:56.820 --> 28:59.114
and gave them to Carlisle to publish.
Swire told me.

28:59.281 --> 29:01.909
And the papers showed that half the
Cabinet were trying to get rich

29:01.992 --> 29:05.078
by buying shares before
a government contract was announced.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.497
Would you rather we were kept in ignorance?

29:07.664 --> 29:09.666
It wasn't Lavinia's
business to make it public.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.753
Without her, the Marconi scandal
would never have happened.

29:12.836 --> 29:16.507
The politicians broke the law.
Lavinia did nothing wrong.

29:16.924 --> 29:20.427
She drags the Chancellor of the Exchequer's
honor through the mud

29:20.511 --> 29:21.553
and you say it's nothing!

29:21.678 --> 29:23.180
It was only Lloyd George.

29:23.388 --> 29:26.892
But why did she betray her uncle
to Sir Richard in the first place?

29:27.017 --> 29:29.353
Because they were lovers. Ooh.

29:30.771 --> 29:31.855
Exactly.

29:32.189 --> 29:34.191
And now it is down to you
to save Matthew

29:34.274 --> 29:36.693
from the clutches of a scheming harlot!

29:37.194 --> 29:40.697
Really, Rosamund,
there's no need to be so gleeful.

29:40.781 --> 29:44.451
You sound like Robespierre
lopping off the head of Marie-Antoinette.

29:48.914 --> 29:50.374
It was me.

29:51.542 --> 29:54.294
I knew you used to go into the village
on a Wednesday.

29:55.796 --> 29:57.548
I so longed for a glimpse of you.

29:59.383 --> 30:01.301
But why are you up here at all?

30:01.969 --> 30:03.720
And why didn't you tell me?

30:03.804 --> 30:06.014
Because I want to get things settled first.

30:06.098 --> 30:10.185
You see, I've discovered that Vera
has been unfaithful to me.

30:10.269 --> 30:11.770
I've got proof.

30:12.563 --> 30:14.064
We can't criticize her for that.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.108
No. But it means I can divorce her.

30:16.650 --> 30:19.319
I've had to leave the house
to prove that it has broken the marriage.

30:20.904 --> 30:22.739
So I came up here to be nearer you.

30:23.156 --> 30:25.576
- But what if she fights it?
- She can't.

30:26.994 --> 30:29.746
For her to divorce me,
she needs something beyond adultery,

30:30.622 --> 30:32.833
cruelty or suchlike.

30:32.916 --> 30:34.835
For a husband, adultery is enough.

30:35.669 --> 30:39.423
- That's not very fair to women.
- I don't care about fairness, I care about you.

30:41.175 --> 30:43.760
The point is, I can get rid of her.

30:44.928 --> 30:47.347
If she goes quietly,
I will give her money and plenty of it.

30:47.431 --> 30:49.474
If not, she leaves empty-handed.

30:50.559 --> 30:51.727
And when will this be?

30:52.352 --> 30:54.521
I need to get her to accept it first.

30:56.565 --> 30:59.318
She's made threats
about selling stuff to the papers.

31:00.611 --> 31:04.489
- What stuff?
- Don't worry. They won't offer what I will.

31:06.909 --> 31:08.535
You've changed your hair.

31:10.204 --> 31:12.956
I was trying out Lady
Mary's new curling iron.

31:16.293 --> 31:17.669
What do you think?

31:19.838 --> 31:23.217
I think I would love you,
however, whatever, whenever.

31:26.303 --> 31:28.305
We don't have to wait, you know.

31:29.556 --> 31:33.852
If you want me to throw up everything
and come with you, I will. Gladly.

31:33.936 --> 31:38.106
I can't marry you yet, not legally,
and I won't break the law.

31:39.775 --> 31:42.152
It's not against the law
to take a mistress, Mr Bates.

31:51.828 --> 31:55.624
I know you, Anna Smith, and I love you,
and that is not the right path for you.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.795
It won't be long now.

32:12.474 --> 32:14.643
So, you're not going to war then?

32:15.602 --> 32:16.937
Apparently not.

32:19.106 --> 32:22.025
Is it true about Mr Crawley
bringing a famous general here?

32:22.109 --> 32:25.195
Captain Crawley, but yes. Why?

32:27.364 --> 32:28.866
No reason.

32:30.701 --> 32:33.745
If they arrive at 5:00,
we'll walk him round the wards,

32:33.829 --> 32:36.123
then show him the recovering men at play

32:36.206 --> 32:39.168
and after that a fairly grand dinner.
I'll tell them to bring mess kit.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.336
That is my challenge, milord.

32:41.420 --> 32:44.965
How to make the dinner sufficiently grand
with no footmen in the house.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.092
Plenty of people give dinners
without footmen.

32:47.426 --> 32:51.638
Not people who entertain Sir
Herbert Strutt, hero of the Somme.

32:52.681 --> 32:55.142
I'm sure he'll have seen
worse things at the front

32:55.225 --> 32:57.060
than a dinner with no footmen.

32:57.144 --> 32:59.605
Carson only wants to show the general
proper respect.

32:59.688 --> 33:02.858
We will not criticize him for that.
Indeed we will not.

33:02.941 --> 33:05.319
But I think Lord Grantham's plan
is a good one,

33:05.402 --> 33:07.196
with or without footmen.

33:07.654 --> 33:10.824
Matthew writes Miss Swire
is coming down from London for it.

33:11.658 --> 33:13.702
Really? He never said so to me.

33:14.369 --> 33:15.871
Does he need your permission?

33:18.832 --> 33:20.959
I think I should go round with him.

33:21.460 --> 33:23.879
You and Lady Grantham
will both come with us.

33:24.671 --> 33:26.465
But won't he want to talk about treatments?

33:27.132 --> 33:29.426
The treatments and the house.

33:43.565 --> 33:44.608
Miss?

33:47.819 --> 33:49.655
It's Captain Smiley, isn't it?

33:51.114 --> 33:53.825
We haven't met yet, but I'm Edith Crawley,

33:53.909 --> 33:56.078
and tomorrow I can show you
where everything is.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.623
It's just that I'd like to write a letter
to my parents.

33:59.915 --> 34:03.627
Of course.
There's paper and envelopes in the library.

34:04.336 --> 34:08.297
No. You see, I've not written before
because I didn't want to worry my mother

34:08.382 --> 34:09.675
with the different handwriting.

34:17.391 --> 34:19.726
I'm left-handed. How's that for luck?

34:22.271 --> 34:24.731
I'm surprised your school
didn't force you to use the right.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.694
My mother wouldn't let them,
but now I wish they had.

34:30.779 --> 34:33.239
I've asked the others
and they say you're the one to help me.

34:33.991 --> 34:36.493
Of course I will. I'd be happy to.

34:37.619 --> 34:39.161
That's what they said.

34:40.789 --> 34:44.418
If you can just find a way to tell her?

34:46.253 --> 34:48.172
We'll both find a way.

34:48.255 --> 34:50.424
Together. I promise.

34:56.013 --> 34:57.347
Mr Carson, might I have a word?

34:58.473 --> 35:00.601
I'm busy with this dinner
for tomorrow night.

35:01.310 --> 35:02.936
Well, that's just it.

35:03.020 --> 35:05.522
I don't expect you'll be using Mr Lang.
Not after last time.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.318
- I will not.
- So I wondered if I might be any help.

35:10.319 --> 35:11.695
I've waited at table before.

35:12.279 --> 35:16.074
Do you mean it? I know I've no
right to ask it of a chauffeur.

35:17.326 --> 35:19.203
We have to keep up the honor of Downton,
don't we?

35:20.579 --> 35:24.333
I'm very grateful, Mr Branson.
I'll not hide it. Very grateful, indeed.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.793
- You know where to find a livery?
- I do.

35:27.461 --> 35:30.380
And I gather you won't be leaving us,
after all?

35:32.424 --> 35:34.718
Who knows what the future will bring?

35:43.936 --> 35:46.188
Mrs Hughes? What is it?

35:46.271 --> 35:47.481
Who's shouting?

35:47.564 --> 35:49.233
What's going on?
I'm about to find out.

35:49.316 --> 35:50.692
It's Mr Lang.

35:50.776 --> 35:53.612
What in heaven's name's happening?

35:53.737 --> 35:56.281
No! No, I can't do it!

35:56.657 --> 35:58.742
Mr Lang. Mr Lang wake up...
I can't do it!

35:58.825 --> 36:00.577
You're having a bad dream, Mr Lang!

36:00.661 --> 36:02.663
- You're having a dream.
- It's the soldiers, Mr Carson.

36:02.955 --> 36:06.583
It's the soldiers, but I can't.
I can't go back, no matter what...

36:06.667 --> 36:10.128
- No one's asking you to go back, Mr Lang.
- No. Just to put a sock in it.

36:10.254 --> 36:12.673
Don't worry, Mr Lang.
You've had a bad dream, that's all.

36:16.301 --> 36:17.761
Is it a dream?

36:20.639 --> 36:22.641
Thank God.

36:26.436 --> 36:27.437
Oh, thank God.

36:28.981 --> 36:31.149
- Thank God.
- You're all right.

36:31.275 --> 36:33.277
Let's get you back into bed.

36:34.152 --> 36:35.779
You're all right.

36:37.948 --> 36:40.284
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Mr Lang.

36:41.368 --> 36:43.287
- I'm sorry.
- You're all right.

36:45.289 --> 36:47.958
Is it any wonder
when he's been to hell and back?

36:58.635 --> 37:00.137
Up.

37:01.388 --> 37:02.556
UP...

37:20.324 --> 37:21.658
My cousin, Lord Grantham.

37:21.783 --> 37:23.368
This is very kind of you, Lord Grantham.

37:23.493 --> 37:25.120
- Welcome.
- Lady Grantham.

37:25.996 --> 37:29.750
And this is Major Clarkson,
who runs our hospital here.

37:29.833 --> 37:33.962
And I am Captain Crawley's mother,
and will accompany you on your tour

37:34.046 --> 37:37.007
and explain the different levels
of care we practice here.

37:37.132 --> 37:41.178
Lady Grantham and Mrs Crawley
will both accompany us as we go round, sir.

37:41.303 --> 37:44.014
Makes a nice change
from the craggy-faced warriors

37:44.139 --> 37:45.307
I'm usually surrounded by.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.100
I'd like to think that were true.

37:47.184 --> 37:50.145
Please, come this way.
There's a large recreational...

37:50.229 --> 37:51.855
I don't believe
you've ever been to Downton before...

37:51.980 --> 37:54.483
Poor Mother.
How she longs to hold all the reins.

37:54.691 --> 37:56.318
Crawley!

37:57.319 --> 38:00.739
I should go, if only to keep
our respective mothers apart.

38:02.699 --> 38:06.161
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley's none too pleased
to play second fiddle, sir.

38:06.245 --> 38:08.038
Well, I hope she doesn't spoil things.

38:08.163 --> 38:11.124
Well, that's just what I've been
meaning to talk to you about, sir.

38:11.208 --> 38:13.335
You see, I'm trying to run a tight ship...

38:20.717 --> 38:22.302
What's the matter with your aunt?

38:22.386 --> 38:25.848
We should follow them in
or Mama will say we're unsupportive.

38:25.931 --> 38:27.891
Tell me what it is, please.

38:29.226 --> 38:30.894
All right.

38:31.019 --> 38:32.563
I know he's going to propose.

38:32.688 --> 38:36.567
Well, then you're going to accept.
Did you get that picture taken?

38:36.692 --> 38:38.777
- I did, yeah, but...
- Then fetch it.

38:38.902 --> 38:40.445
Because if you think I'm gonna stand by

38:40.571 --> 38:42.656
and watch that boy's dreams
stamped in the dust,

38:42.739 --> 38:44.616
you've got another think coming.

38:44.741 --> 38:48.745
You can take back your promise
when the war's over and not before!

38:48.871 --> 38:50.831
But it's a lie!

38:50.914 --> 38:54.251
Don't make him give up
when he's off to face the guns.

38:54.376 --> 38:57.087
You'd never forgive yourself
if aught happened.

38:59.590 --> 39:01.091
Do you remember when Aunt Rosamund

39:01.216 --> 39:04.011
found you and Richard Carlisle
together in the garden?

39:04.094 --> 39:06.430
I knew I'd hear more about that.

39:06.555 --> 39:08.682
She thought he was threatening you.

39:08.765 --> 39:14.104
And now she's decided that you were behind
the Marconi share scandal in 1912.

39:15.272 --> 39:18.275
The Chancellor and other ministers
were involved, including your uncle.

39:18.358 --> 39:20.611
I remember the Marconi scandal.

39:20.736 --> 39:23.197
No. Let's forget it. It's absurd.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.199
But Lady Rosamund is right.

39:26.575 --> 39:29.453
I did steal the evidence
for Sir Richard to print.

39:30.454 --> 39:32.206
I did start the scandal.

39:33.749 --> 39:34.875
The trouble is.

39:34.958 --> 39:37.794
Aunt Rosamund can't understand
why you would do such a thing

39:37.920 --> 39:41.048
unless you and Sir Richard were...

39:41.131 --> 39:43.800
Were lovers.
Mary, you must come.

39:48.430 --> 39:52.392
The ground-floor rooms are for those men
who need the most care, sir.

39:52.476 --> 39:53.727
Yes, of course.

39:53.810 --> 39:55.062
General Strutt, sir.

39:57.648 --> 39:59.566
Oh, right. Yes.

40:00.609 --> 40:01.735
Tell me about this officer.

40:01.818 --> 40:05.489
Who is that man?
I hope he's not complaining.

40:05.572 --> 40:10.285
Oh, no. That's Captain Smiley.
He hasn't an unkind bone in his body.

40:10.994 --> 40:12.412
How do you know?

40:12.496 --> 40:14.790
Matthew, listen to this.

40:15.457 --> 40:16.667
Everything all right, sir?

40:16.792 --> 40:18.335
What on earth is that about?

40:18.460 --> 40:20.838
Oh, don't worry.
Major Holmes can be a little waspish,

40:20.921 --> 40:23.465
but he wouldn't want to
get us into trouble.

40:24.591 --> 40:28.095
How do you know so much
about a pack of strangers?

40:28.178 --> 40:30.597
They're not strangers to me.

40:31.932 --> 40:34.268
This is all very impressive, Lady Grantham.

40:34.351 --> 40:37.187
The nurses and your own staff
are to be congratulated.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.274
I believe they are.

40:41.984 --> 40:46.947
I wouldn't say I was scared. I'm nervous.
Of course I am...

40:47.865 --> 40:51.410
But not scared. I think I'm ready.

40:51.493 --> 40:54.079
Don't mind me.

40:54.162 --> 40:56.999
Only I'm thinking
of what your dear mother would say.

40:58.166 --> 41:00.127
Well, I wish she was here to see me off.

41:00.961 --> 41:02.504
Oh, she'd be so proud.

41:03.714 --> 41:07.384
Why, when we waved off our Archie,
I remember...

41:09.887 --> 41:13.849
What do you remember, Mrs Patmore?
I'll tell you.

41:15.434 --> 41:19.229
You remember a fine young man,
who enlisted before he had to,

41:19.354 --> 41:21.607
and who gave his life for his country.

41:22.399 --> 41:25.861
Because he'd be alive and well today
if he hadn't chosen to go to war.

41:26.361 --> 41:27.821
She's right.

41:28.697 --> 41:29.823
Happen she is.

41:30.574 --> 41:33.160
Come on, Daisy. Back to the grindstone.

41:34.578 --> 41:36.830
- What is it?
- I just want a word with Daisy.

41:37.789 --> 41:39.208
I'm needed in the kitchen.

41:40.584 --> 41:42.836
There's plenty of time later on.

41:48.217 --> 41:50.260
Let's see what my aim is like.

41:50.344 --> 41:51.929
- And again.
- Oh.

41:52.012 --> 41:54.515
You must be enjoying
your respite from the front.

41:54.598 --> 41:56.225
Actually, I'm struggling a bit.

41:56.308 --> 41:58.936
I've just lost my soldier servant
and I haven't managed to replace him yet.

42:01.146 --> 42:02.606
So when will you tell Matthew?

42:03.482 --> 42:05.484
Dinner is served, milady.

42:05.567 --> 42:07.528
Don't waste the opportunity.

42:12.699 --> 42:15.869
Why must she be so savage?
It's my broken heart.

42:15.953 --> 42:18.247
And it was her advice
that wrecked it in the first place.

42:18.330 --> 42:19.414
It's classic Rosamund.

42:19.498 --> 42:22.459
She's never more righteous
than when she's in the wrong.

42:22.543 --> 42:23.919
Come on.

42:25.629 --> 42:29.049
- Everything all right, Mr Branson?
- I think so, Mrs Hughes.

43:30.777 --> 43:33.363
- Where's Mr Branson?
- He's just taken up the soup. Why?

43:33.447 --> 43:34.823
Read that!

43:35.032 --> 43:38.911
"They'll have arrested me by now,
but I'm not sorry."

43:39.203 --> 43:41.830
"The bastard had it coming to him."

43:43.957 --> 43:45.334
Oh!

43:50.672 --> 43:51.924
What in God's name!

43:52.007 --> 43:53.175
Read this!

43:56.845 --> 43:58.222
Where is he now?

43:58.305 --> 43:59.348
Oh, my God!

44:12.486 --> 44:14.279
I'm sorry to hear about your servant.

44:15.531 --> 44:18.116
Yes, pneumonia, not a bullet.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.368
No.

44:19.451 --> 44:20.577
Yes.

44:22.579 --> 44:26.416
I don't envy you.
A decent servant can change your war.

44:39.179 --> 44:41.098
Get downstairs! Now!

44:46.770 --> 44:48.981
All right, all right!
There's no need to be so rough.

44:49.106 --> 44:52.359
There's every need!
To stop a murder!

44:52.526 --> 44:54.027
Murder! What do you mean "murder"?

44:54.194 --> 44:56.113
You were going to assassinate the general!

44:56.196 --> 44:58.782
Kill the general? I was not!

45:00.325 --> 45:02.119
I was going to throw that lot all over him.

45:02.202 --> 45:04.037
- What is it?
- Oil and ink,

45:04.162 --> 45:06.623
and a bit of a cowpat,
all mixed with sour milk.

45:07.165 --> 45:09.877
He'd have needed a bath right enough,
but not a coffin.

45:11.211 --> 45:13.964
I thought you'd taken the soup up,
but you left it in the pantry.

45:14.548 --> 45:18.427
We'll use this. It's not been
heated, but the hell with that!

45:18.510 --> 45:20.429
And we'll decide what happens to you later!

45:20.512 --> 45:24.433
Never mind later! What about now?
How do we keep this dinner going?

45:24.516 --> 45:26.310
I'll serve, Mr Carson. I don't mind.

45:27.811 --> 45:30.355
Who knows when I'll have the chance again?

45:33.400 --> 45:36.278
What was going on with the soup?
It came, it went...

45:36.361 --> 45:37.905
Nothing to worry about, milord.

45:37.988 --> 45:39.323
Branson was taken ill,

45:39.489 --> 45:42.659
so William volunteered
to be footman one last time.

45:42.743 --> 45:44.703
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, not a bit.

45:44.828 --> 45:46.371
It's very kind of him.

45:46.496 --> 45:50.042
Our footman, William, is leaving
us tomorrow to join his regiment.

45:50.167 --> 45:51.585
That's why he's not in livery.

45:51.668 --> 45:54.254
You are a credit to this house
and this country, young man.

45:54.838 --> 45:58.425
There is no livery so
becoming as a uniform.

45:59.051 --> 46:00.177
Sir.

46:01.345 --> 46:05.849
Lady Rosamund, Mary, all of you,
have been so kind to Lavinia.

46:06.850 --> 46:10.687
Well, naturally. We're all curious
to know more of Miss Swire...

46:11.188 --> 46:13.899
if she is to reign over Downton as queen.

46:15.234 --> 46:18.195
Dear me. I hope you haven't
unearthed anything too fearful.

46:18.695 --> 46:20.239
You must ask Mary.

46:22.908 --> 46:25.327
One thing I am still not quite clear about.

46:25.410 --> 46:28.539
Who precisely is in charge of Downton
when you're not here?

46:29.039 --> 46:32.292
Uh, I've given it some thought, sir,
and it seems to be only fair

46:32.376 --> 46:38.006
that Mrs Crawley and Lady Grantham
should share that responsibility.

46:38.674 --> 46:40.050
Capital. Well said.

46:40.717 --> 46:45.639
The fact is, I have been
more than gratified by my visit here today,

46:45.722 --> 46:47.891
and I thank Captain
Crawley for arranging it.

46:48.016 --> 46:49.226
Hear, hear.

46:49.726 --> 46:53.897
You are all to be praised
for your response to our national crisis.

46:54.022 --> 46:56.733
But I've been talking and
I've been listening,

46:57.734 --> 46:59.820
and I feel there is one among you

46:59.903 --> 47:03.866
whose generosity is in danger
of going unremarked.

47:04.283 --> 47:08.579
It seems the daily cares and needs
of the patients are being dealt with

47:08.704 --> 47:10.956
quietly and efficiently

47:11.081 --> 47:12.916
by Lady Edith.

47:16.587 --> 47:18.964
Or that's what the officers tell me.

47:19.089 --> 47:23.886
So, let us raise our glasses
and drink her health.

47:24.219 --> 47:25.429
Edith. Darling.

47:25.554 --> 47:26.680
Lady Edith!

47:26.763 --> 47:27.806
Edith, dear.

47:32.144 --> 47:34.771
We were never lovers. Not ever.

47:34.897 --> 47:37.649
You don't have to explain anything.
Not to me.

47:37.774 --> 47:39.484
But I want to.

47:39.610 --> 47:40.944
You see,

47:42.988 --> 47:46.533
my father owed Sir Richard Carlisle
a lot of money.

47:46.617 --> 47:48.160
Enough to bankrupt him.

47:49.786 --> 47:51.663
And Sir Richard offered to waive the debt

47:51.788 --> 47:54.458
if you gave him
the evidence of the ministers' guilt?

47:54.958 --> 47:56.835
Papa was terrified,

47:56.960 --> 48:00.506
and I knew I could get into my
uncle's office and find the proof.

48:04.134 --> 48:05.344
What is it?

48:07.763 --> 48:11.183
He threatened to tell you all about it
and now I've told you anyway.

48:13.018 --> 48:16.146
My uncle was guilty. They all were.

48:16.855 --> 48:19.024
Sir Richard didn't make it up.

48:19.149 --> 48:20.776
I believe you.

48:20.859 --> 48:22.986
But that's not why I did it.

48:23.820 --> 48:25.614
It was entirely to save Papa from ruin.

48:33.997 --> 48:37.501
- Have you got that picture for me?
- I might have.

48:45.509 --> 48:50.347
Because you know
what I'm going to ask you, so, will you?

48:52.099 --> 48:55.352
William, you're not sure.
You can't be sure.

48:55.477 --> 48:56.770
I am sure.

48:56.854 --> 48:58.021
So is she.

48:58.522 --> 49:01.942
Aren't you, Daisy? Isn't it just what
you told me you hoped would happen?

49:02.693 --> 49:04.194
It's like a fairy story.

49:08.115 --> 49:11.618
Is she right, Daisy? Are we engaged?

49:12.619 --> 49:16.206
Because if we are,
I know I can tackle whatever may come!

49:21.712 --> 49:23.297
Go on, then.

49:28.886 --> 49:30.470
William?

49:31.805 --> 49:32.890
Do you want to go up top?

49:32.973 --> 49:36.476
The general's leaving
and Mr Carson likes a full complement.

49:36.560 --> 49:40.981
No, Daisy. Not you.
The war has not changed everything.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.654
The general is just about to leave.

49:48.030 --> 49:49.740
I'm afraid he doesn't have time
to come in here.

49:50.741 --> 49:53.035
I hope it's all been a success.

49:54.077 --> 49:57.664
Cousin Violet said you had something
to say to me about Lavinia.

49:58.916 --> 50:00.083
What is it?

50:00.751 --> 50:02.085
I haven't the slightest idea.

50:02.669 --> 50:04.087
Oh. What a relief.

50:04.171 --> 50:07.883
She was hinting
you'd uncovered some horrid stain.

50:09.259 --> 50:12.930
The only evidence I've uncovered
is that she's a charming person.

50:13.764 --> 50:15.098
What a testimonial.

50:16.225 --> 50:19.603
The truth is, we're very much alike,
so naturally I think she's perfect.

50:20.938 --> 50:24.483
We all do. Don't we, Aunt Rosamund?

50:25.192 --> 50:26.860
Quite perfect.

50:37.621 --> 50:41.708
Is there any chance you might take
our footman, William, for your servant?

50:41.792 --> 50:44.711
I can pull some strings,
get him transferred to your lot.

50:44.795 --> 50:47.840
If you'd like me to, of course.
I can't promise to keep him safe.

50:47.923 --> 50:51.260
I know.
But he'd have someone looking out for him.

50:53.053 --> 50:54.471
Oh, my God.

50:55.722 --> 50:57.683
Lang, are you all right, old chap?

50:58.934 --> 51:01.520
Come, come, man.
Things can't be as bad as all that.

51:01.603 --> 51:04.314
- Carson?
- Mr Lang, what's happened?

51:04.857 --> 51:08.151
Sir. The general and all these officers...

51:09.820 --> 51:11.446
I don't have to go back with them, do I?

51:11.530 --> 51:13.907
- Because I can't, sir.
- No.

51:14.074 --> 51:15.784
The general's looking for you, milord.

51:15.868 --> 51:17.202
Excuse me.

51:17.286 --> 51:18.328
It's been a great pleasure.

51:18.412 --> 51:21.790
If I don't see you again
before I have to go back, be safe.

51:24.543 --> 51:25.836
You, too.

51:30.382 --> 51:31.800
Come inside.

51:38.182 --> 51:39.391
UP!

51:49.401 --> 51:50.903
Here.

51:52.237 --> 51:53.447
We've earned it.

51:53.530 --> 51:54.823
Ah.

51:56.950 --> 51:59.119
So, what will you do with him?

51:59.203 --> 52:02.623
- Branson or Lang?
- Not Mr Lang.

52:03.332 --> 52:05.792
He isn't well, but he's not a bad man.

52:06.001 --> 52:09.963
Oh, not at all.
But he doesn't belong at Downton.

52:11.089 --> 52:13.425
I meant Mr Branson.

52:13.509 --> 52:16.136
Hmm, it's a delicate business, Mrs Hughes.

52:16.762 --> 52:19.056
Would we really be right to tell the police

52:19.139 --> 52:23.060
and cause a furore
and bring riot down on our heads?

52:23.143 --> 52:27.272
And all because he wanted to pour
a pot of slop over a man's head?

52:29.191 --> 52:32.861
From your phrasing, I gather the
answer you want from me is "no"?

52:32.945 --> 52:37.282
Well, would it help, Mrs Hughes?
That's all I'm asking.

52:37.366 --> 52:38.742
Would it help?

52:38.825 --> 52:39.952
Where's Mr Branson?

52:40.035 --> 52:43.372
Mr Carson sent him back to his cottage
to stew in his own juice.

52:43.956 --> 52:47.376
Will we see you in the morning, William,
to wish you luck?

52:47.459 --> 52:51.880
Oh, yes.
But I've got something I'd like to say now.

52:51.964 --> 52:54.341
- If you don't mind.
- Don't. Not yet.

52:55.259 --> 52:57.427
They must know sooner or later.

52:58.387 --> 53:01.306
Daisy and I are going to be married.

53:01.390 --> 53:04.643
Oh! You never are! When?

53:05.018 --> 53:06.645
After the war.

53:06.728 --> 53:08.564
I'm not sure I can wait that long.

53:21.702 --> 53:26.498
I see what I had planned to say
is already superfluous, Mr Lang.

53:27.207 --> 53:28.876
You got there before me.

53:30.586 --> 53:34.298
I've let you down, Mr Carson,
for that I'm sorry.

53:34.381 --> 53:35.674
We let you down.

53:36.675 --> 53:39.845
You weren't suited for work,
and I should have spotted that.

53:40.179 --> 53:44.474
You'll have two months' wages,
and please tell us how you get on.

53:44.558 --> 53:49.563
And when you're ready for work again,
you may rely on a good report from me.

53:50.564 --> 53:53.525
That's kind. Thank you.

54:03.160 --> 54:05.996
It was nice of William to serve tonight.
He didn't have to.

54:07.372 --> 54:09.833
I'm going to arrange for him
to be Matthew's servant.

54:09.917 --> 54:12.211
With any luck, it'll
keep him out of trouble.

54:12.836 --> 54:17.257
Matthew and Mary looked so natural together.
Did you notice?

54:18.175 --> 54:20.511
Talking and laughing.

54:21.762 --> 54:24.264
But I suppose Lavinia is a nice girl.

54:24.806 --> 54:27.518
We've dreamed a dream, my dear,
but now it's over.

54:29.436 --> 54:33.815
The world was in a dream before the war, but
now it's woken up and said goodbye to it.

54:35.067 --> 54:36.401
And so must we.
