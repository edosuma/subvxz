00:01.476 --> 00:04.814
I've been
coming from far away.

00:04.881 --> 00:09.151
I'm miles from anywhere,
just another day...

00:12.254 --> 00:13.355
So hold me up.

00:13.422 --> 00:15.357
Come on, hold me up.

00:15.424 --> 00:17.292
Can't you hear me calling?

00:21.998 --> 00:24.901
The way the clouds move.

00:24.968 --> 00:28.537
Here they come,
they're big and black.

00:33.442 --> 00:36.679
--Here they come,
they're big and black.

00:36.746 --> 00:42.819
And that's the sound of the man
who's working on his way back.

00:51.526 --> 00:54.463
And now she comes to me.

00:54.529 --> 00:55.865
Yeah she comes to me at last.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.607
And now she comes to me.

01:04.674 --> 01:08.778
She comes to me at last.

01:12.314 --> 01:17.419
And I was waiting, I was
waiting, like an empty glass.

01:24.827 --> 01:27.496
And I was waiting, I was--

01:27.562 --> 01:29.297
OK, I'm done Mrs. Markey!

01:29.364 --> 01:30.165
I'm done.

01:42.645 --> 01:47.249
A thousand little
pieces fall to the ground

01:47.315 --> 01:51.721
and pass through my
fingers on their way down.

01:51.788 --> 01:56.358
Talk about the dreams
of a younger man.

01:56.425 --> 02:00.596
You can't miss
something you never had.

02:00.663 --> 02:04.934
Am I just too young to know?

02:05.001 --> 02:08.236
Too naive to let it go?

02:13.976 --> 02:18.280
Tired of all the love songs
that don't speak to me.

02:18.346 --> 02:22.417
Tired of the birds
singing outside my window.

02:22.484 --> 02:26.421
Tired of the sun
shining down on me--

02:26.488 --> 02:28.557
Holden Caulfield.

02:28.624 --> 02:30.358
He is-- naive.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.902
and he is resentful
of the adult world.

02:39.969 --> 02:42.872
Pieces
of my broken heart.

02:42.939 --> 02:44.573
Falling down.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.577
Pieces of my fragile pride.

02:47.643 --> 02:48.778
Falling down.

02:48.845 --> 02:53.850
Memories of you and
I are falling down--

02:53.916 --> 02:54.851
--Thank you.

02:54.917 --> 02:55.985
Goodnight.

03:08.865 --> 03:10.767
Mom, did you call
Professor Green again?

03:10.833 --> 03:12.835
--Honey, "Catcher In The Rye"!?

03:12.902 --> 03:14.203
That's high school
material, isn't it?

03:14.269 --> 03:16.571
I thought we agreed you
would stop checking up on me.

03:16.639 --> 03:18.775
--And I know Peter's
demanding, but he's just trying

03:18.841 --> 03:19.976
to get the best out of you.

03:20.042 --> 03:22.477
If you can just try
to be more punctual.

03:22.544 --> 03:24.781
Mom, he's got me working
in the science building.

03:24.847 --> 03:26.149
It's on the other
side of campus.

03:26.215 --> 03:29.886
--And save the creative
energy for your dissertation.

03:29.952 --> 03:31.621
Wait, what did he
say about that?

03:31.687 --> 03:34.724
Richard, I love your music.

03:34.791 --> 03:35.858
You know that.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.794
But you lost a lot
of time with that,

03:37.860 --> 03:40.495
and you're not a kid anymore.

03:40.562 --> 03:42.564
If you can just stay focused
for a few more months,

03:42.632 --> 03:44.432
you'll have your
doctorate, and you can get

03:44.499 --> 03:46.368
a tenured position, benefits.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.470
You've got all weekend to
work on your dissertation.

03:48.537 --> 03:51.674
So promise me you
won't do any music.

03:51.741 --> 03:52.608
--Richard?

03:52.675 --> 03:53.876
What's that sound?

03:53.943 --> 03:55.044
Is your phone acting up again?

03:55.111 --> 03:57.445
Mom, I'm still here.

03:57.512 --> 03:58.581
--There you are.

03:58.648 --> 03:59.548
I thought I'd lost
you for a moment.

04:00.983 --> 04:01.784
Oh, my god.

04:01.851 --> 04:02.417
Richard?

04:02.484 --> 04:03.019
Are you there?

04:03.085 --> 04:03.653
Holy shit, dude.

04:03.719 --> 04:05.054
You all right?

04:05.121 --> 04:06.823
That was fucking close.

04:06.889 --> 04:07.522
Richard?

04:07.590 --> 04:09.391
Are you all right?

04:09.457 --> 04:10.860
Sorry.

04:10.927 --> 04:14.831
La, la, la, la.

04:14.897 --> 04:17.733
La, la, la, la, la.

04:53.102 --> 04:55.838
Oh, sorry.

04:55.905 --> 04:58.975
I was just digging
the music, and--

04:59.041 --> 05:00.475
uh, uh.

05:00.542 --> 05:02.812
Do you work at
Carlin University?

05:02.879 --> 05:04.780
I'm a student
there, and I teach--

05:04.847 --> 05:06.148
I knew it.

05:06.215 --> 05:07.984
I'm the guy who nearly killed
you with the tree branch

05:08.050 --> 05:10.152
yesterday.

05:10.219 --> 05:13.890
Uh, it's getting more
awkward, isn't it?

05:13.956 --> 05:15.124
Sorry, I'm Greg.

05:15.191 --> 05:16.491
Um, how did you--

05:16.558 --> 05:16.993
Wow.

05:17.059 --> 05:18.261
Wow.

05:18.327 --> 05:19.729
That is some old school
business right there.

05:19.795 --> 05:20.462
Whoa.

05:26.669 --> 05:27.937
Oh, my goodness.

05:28.004 --> 05:30.740
I had exactly the same
boombox when I was a kid.

05:30.806 --> 05:32.540
Is that yours?

05:32.608 --> 05:34.076
Yeah, cassettes are
better for the--

05:34.143 --> 05:35.011
No, no, no, no.

05:35.077 --> 05:36.979
I mean the song.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.546
--I'm working on it.

05:38.614 --> 05:41.617
Oh, wow.

05:41.684 --> 05:43.986
You play too?

05:44.053 --> 05:45.321
Guitar, a little bit.

05:45.388 --> 05:48.858
That song you were playing
about the empty glass,

05:48.925 --> 05:50.525
is that yours too?

05:50.593 --> 05:51.627
That's just--

05:51.694 --> 05:52.795
No.

05:52.862 --> 05:54.764
No, no, no, no, no.

05:54.830 --> 05:55.665
You're kidding me.

05:55.731 --> 05:56.531
That's not a--

05:56.599 --> 05:58.601
This is your throwaway song?

05:58.668 --> 06:00.568
You've got to play me
some songs you keep.

06:03.571 --> 06:09.178
Would you mind-- nice guitar--

06:09.245 --> 06:11.180
would you mind
playing this for me?

06:11.247 --> 06:14.784
I'd love to hear it without
the door in the way.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.055
OK.

06:19.121 --> 06:19.789
All right.

06:19.855 --> 06:20.756
Here, do you want these?

06:26.729 --> 06:29.265
Oh, my god.

06:29.332 --> 06:32.802
That's an interesting
picking pattern.

06:32.868 --> 06:33.535
Do you mind?

06:33.602 --> 06:34.469
I have an idea for--

06:39.208 --> 06:40.475
it's in E?

06:50.019 --> 06:52.588
That's nice.

06:52.655 --> 06:53.889
What's next?

06:53.956 --> 06:55.958
There's a bunch of changes.

06:56.025 --> 06:56.692
These ones?

07:01.697 --> 07:07.136
I've been a
coming from far away.

07:07.203 --> 07:10.306
I'm miles from anywhere.

07:10.373 --> 07:16.946
Another day-- That I rest
my mind singing songs

07:17.013 --> 07:18.147
with the old ones.

07:23.285 --> 07:25.855
So hold me up.

07:25.921 --> 07:26.822
Come on.

07:26.889 --> 07:27.656
Hold me up.

07:27.723 --> 07:29.191
Can't you hear me calling?

07:35.097 --> 07:38.868
The way the clouds
move, here they come,

07:38.934 --> 07:40.202
they're big and black.

07:45.341 --> 07:51.881
And I was waiting, I was
waiting like an empty glass.

07:51.947 --> 07:54.050
--What's this?

07:54.116 --> 07:57.019
Yeah, so fill me up.

07:57.086 --> 07:59.922
Come on and fill me up.

07:59.989 --> 08:02.892
From your loving cup, baby.

08:02.958 --> 08:04.827
From your loving cup.

08:04.894 --> 08:06.028
Oh.

08:06.095 --> 08:09.965
To drink you down, yeah.

08:19.975 --> 08:22.878
Ah.

08:22.945 --> 08:24.113
It's her nap time--

08:24.180 --> 08:25.047
Mrs. Markey.

08:25.114 --> 08:26.382
At 4 PM?

08:26.449 --> 08:29.819
She takes a lot of naps.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.088
That's all right, I have
to get back to work.

08:32.154 --> 08:33.389
Wait, You've got to be kidding.

08:33.456 --> 08:35.391
We gotta keep this going, man.

08:35.458 --> 08:37.159
I-- I don't think so.

08:37.226 --> 08:37.860
Come on.

08:37.927 --> 08:38.861
Grab your guitar.

08:46.869 --> 08:48.270
This is you?

08:48.337 --> 08:49.705
That's embarrassing.

08:49.772 --> 08:52.341
I've never seen you before--
and you live 25 feet away.

08:52.408 --> 08:57.079
That's-- I thought I saw a young
woman move in here recently.

08:57.146 --> 08:57.680
Oh yep.

08:57.746 --> 08:58.314
That was me.

09:01.050 --> 09:02.885
She's in Ohio.

09:02.952 --> 09:04.820
Come on.

09:04.887 --> 09:07.690
I have a little place down
here where we can play.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.825
That's where I was
headed when I heard you.

09:09.892 --> 09:10.459
Cool.

09:10.526 --> 09:11.060
Like a studio?

09:11.127 --> 09:14.130
--Mother fucker.

09:14.196 --> 09:14.730
I'm sorry.

09:14.797 --> 09:15.831
Do you mind?

09:15.898 --> 09:16.966
Mother-- hey!

09:17.032 --> 09:18.968
Hey!

09:19.034 --> 09:19.768
Hey!

09:19.835 --> 09:20.703
Let's go.

09:20.769 --> 09:21.904
Come on.

09:21.971 --> 09:23.973
Let's go.

09:24.039 --> 09:24.940
Hey!

09:25.007 --> 09:25.808
Hey!

09:25.875 --> 09:29.178
You-- yeah, you better run.

09:29.245 --> 09:30.846
You little shits.

09:30.913 --> 09:32.047
Phew.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.115
Juvenile delinquents.

09:33.182 --> 09:34.316
Don't you have parents?

09:34.383 --> 09:36.185
Parole officers?

09:36.252 --> 09:38.787
They steal anything?

09:39.989 --> 09:42.858
No, they just keep
breaking in to smoke pot.

09:42.925 --> 09:43.726
Come on.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.227
I'm going to introduce you.

09:45.294 --> 09:48.497
Bonnie Blue-- used to tour with
her, but the band broke up.

09:48.564 --> 09:53.369
And now she doesn't exactly
run anymore, but here--

09:53.435 --> 09:54.904
pop right up on the seat there.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.843
She's a bit more Babylon
than Bonnie right now,

10:00.910 --> 10:06.415
but she was once the glorious
grand dame of the high road.

10:06.482 --> 10:08.217
Can you hold this for a second?

10:08.284 --> 10:13.923
Oh, it doesn't
usually smell this--

10:13.989 --> 10:15.925
this good.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.894
Thank you.

10:18.961 --> 10:19.461
Alrighty.

10:29.371 --> 10:30.039
Oh wow.

10:30.105 --> 10:31.106
Cool.

10:31.173 --> 10:34.076
Wait a minute--
those little fucks.

10:34.143 --> 10:35.277
What?

10:35.344 --> 10:37.112
My cell phone is gone.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.448
What the fuck is this?

10:39.515 --> 10:44.019
Oh, those little miscreants.

10:44.086 --> 10:44.853
Oh, man.

10:44.920 --> 10:45.721
That could have been bad.

10:45.788 --> 10:48.557
Want me to call the police?

10:48.625 --> 10:50.326
No, no.

10:50.392 --> 10:54.396
I fucking hate those
cell phones anyway.

10:54.463 --> 10:55.531
Digital destroyed music.

10:55.599 --> 10:57.166
And now it's hell
bent on destroying

10:57.233 --> 10:59.468
the rest of civilization.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.171
Remember when you couldn't
be reached in your car?

11:02.238 --> 11:05.274
when It was a place you
went to listen to cassettes

11:05.341 --> 11:06.475
and not be reached.

11:06.542 --> 11:07.677
Afraid to admit it--

11:07.743 --> 11:11.380
woah, I think I have
a second-hand high.

11:11.447 --> 11:13.148
You want a first?

11:13.215 --> 11:14.516
No, I don't really--

11:14.584 --> 11:15.985
No, I don't either, man.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.355
I totally quit, but the universe
just took away my cell phone

11:19.421 --> 11:23.092
and handed me the ultimate
analog time machine.

11:23.158 --> 11:29.298
So-- Here.

11:29.365 --> 11:30.032
Take it.

11:30.099 --> 11:30.566
Take it.

11:30.634 --> 11:31.133
Take it.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.034
Hit that.

11:32.101 --> 11:36.038
Surprisingly strong.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.776
You OK?

11:42.444 --> 11:43.545
Those kids, man.

11:47.449 --> 11:49.084
She's in Ohio you said, right?

11:49.151 --> 11:51.186
Your girlfriend?

11:51.253 --> 11:53.522
Oh, my-- yeah, yeah.

11:53.590 --> 11:57.126
She had a little
family emergency,

11:57.192 --> 11:59.995
so she sat in Columbus
at her folks' house.

12:00.062 --> 12:00.863
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.064
No, no.

12:02.131 --> 12:05.534
If I can get Bonnie here
back on her feet again,

12:05.602 --> 12:09.338
I might drive out there to
surprise her and cheer her up,

12:09.405 --> 12:11.140
you know?

12:11.206 --> 12:14.443
How far is it to Eagle Rock?

12:14.510 --> 12:17.012
The Folk Festival?

12:17.079 --> 12:18.881
I don't know.
Pretty close, I would guess.

12:18.947 --> 12:19.481
Why?

12:19.548 --> 12:20.784
Oh, it's stupid.

12:20.849 --> 12:23.319
A couple of days ago, the
booker from the festival

12:23.385 --> 12:24.553
called out of the blue.

12:24.621 --> 12:26.889
You got a gig at Eagle Rock?

12:26.955 --> 12:27.757
Whoa.

12:27.823 --> 12:29.224
Hey, that's soon, isn't it?

12:29.291 --> 12:30.092
No, I can't do it.

12:30.159 --> 12:31.360
I've got classes, dissertation.

12:31.427 --> 12:36.298
But for some reason, I
couldn't bring myself

12:36.365 --> 12:37.533
to tell him I'd quit music.

12:41.671 --> 12:46.041
Dude, dude, this is, uh--

12:46.108 --> 12:47.176
this is karma.

12:47.242 --> 12:48.010
No, wait a minute.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.445
Karma?

12:49.511 --> 12:50.546
Kismet, maybe?

12:50.613 --> 12:52.047
Yes, that's what I meant--

12:52.114 --> 12:52.915
Kizment.

12:52.981 --> 12:53.949
I'm going to take you there.

12:54.016 --> 12:54.883
We'll get Bonnie
back on the road.

12:54.950 --> 12:56.952
Honestly, I can't do it.
I--

12:57.019 --> 12:58.253
What?

12:58.320 --> 12:59.689
My advisor, he wants me
to work from that weekend.

12:59.756 --> 13:01.190
He's weirdly obsessed with--

13:01.256 --> 13:01.791
On the weekend?

13:01.857 --> 13:03.092
Fuck that, man.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.226
This is Eagle Rock, man.
You can't play that shit.

13:04.293 --> 13:06.696
It's just
the second stage.

13:06.763 --> 13:07.563
And the thing is, we can go
pick up my girl in Columbus.

13:07.630 --> 13:09.198
We could all go over there.

13:09.264 --> 13:10.633
She will love it.

13:10.700 --> 13:14.069
Oh, man.

13:14.136 --> 13:15.137
Who are those kids?

13:15.204 --> 13:18.941
Who are
those fucking kids?

13:21.611 --> 13:24.079
All right.

13:24.146 --> 13:26.014
What else do you got
for me, my friend?

13:26.081 --> 13:27.182
Me?

13:27.249 --> 13:29.351
No, no-- you
play me something.

13:29.418 --> 13:30.219
No, no.

13:30.285 --> 13:32.254
I don't-- I really don't have--

13:32.321 --> 13:34.490
Bull.

13:34.556 --> 13:37.426
I just write stuff
for my girl that's--

13:37.493 --> 13:38.994
Ah-ha.

13:39.061 --> 13:40.562
Play it.

13:40.630 --> 13:41.664
Oh, fuck.

13:44.566 --> 13:45.401
All right.

13:45.467 --> 13:48.303
This is something that I, um--

13:48.370 --> 13:51.006
this is something
I'm working on.

13:51.073 --> 13:55.612
This old house
is cracked and worn.

13:55.678 --> 14:00.115
The walls are faded
and the curtains torn.

14:00.182 --> 14:02.451
Sometimes, it feels
like we're running just

14:02.518 --> 14:05.254
to keep falling behind.

14:08.591 --> 14:15.497
And although the radio
plays only a storm,

14:15.564 --> 14:22.204
still somewhere I hear
the downbeat of a drum.

14:24.774 --> 14:28.745
Dance with me to this song.

14:28.812 --> 14:33.348
Dance now, darling,
let your hair run down.

14:33.415 --> 14:37.352
Dance with me, oh,
all night long.

14:37.419 --> 14:41.290
Dance now, darling, to this--

14:41.356 --> 14:42.024
song.

14:54.236 --> 14:57.640
Come to me darling
put your hand in mine.

14:57.707 --> 14:59.308
Lay your head down
on my shoulder.

14:59.374 --> 15:00.142
Give me your lips.

15:00.209 --> 15:02.044
Sweet like wine.

15:02.110 --> 15:05.514
If a kiss, is just a kiss.

15:05.582 --> 15:08.250
I don't know what
to make of this.

15:08.317 --> 15:15.257
Don't know where, but I
hear the beat of a drum.

15:15.324 --> 15:17.526
Somewhere I swear--

15:17.594 --> 15:18.427
Mrs. Markey, hi!

15:18.494 --> 15:21.631
I hear the strains of a song.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.637
Dance with me to this song.

15:27.704 --> 15:29.371
Dance now, darling.

15:29.438 --> 15:31.406
Let your cares be gone.

15:31.473 --> 15:35.745
Dance with me all night long.

15:35.812 --> 15:39.081
Dance now, darling,
to this song.

16:02.304 --> 16:03.105
Oh, wow.

16:03.171 --> 16:03.673
All right.

16:03.740 --> 16:04.239
All right.

16:04.306 --> 16:04.974
All right.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.709
--Put it in the bag.

16:06.776 --> 16:09.444
Can you help me with the top?

16:09.511 --> 16:10.178
Yeah.

16:10.245 --> 16:11.046
Pull this thing off.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.455
Rasta ganja brotherhood?

16:20.522 --> 16:22.291
Fucking kids.

16:23.893 --> 16:26.395
If you're stuck, and
you feel like you can't move.

16:26.461 --> 16:28.731
And your spirit's sinking low.

16:28.798 --> 16:32.200
As long as you can sing,
baby you got wings.

16:32.267 --> 16:37.674
So maybe you just gotta go
and call in sick to work.

16:37.740 --> 16:41.243
You don't owe
anything to that jerk.

16:41.310 --> 16:44.446
Take some time to get
a little sunshine.

16:44.513 --> 16:48.116
Oh, oh, take it easy.

16:51.821 --> 16:55.390
Gotta take it easy...

17:02.632 --> 17:03.298
Sorry.

17:03.365 --> 17:04.299
Is this distracting you?

17:05.768 --> 17:08.570
No, I love it.

17:08.638 --> 17:10.539
Is that your
girlfriend singing too?

17:10.607 --> 17:11.808
Yep.

17:11.874 --> 17:14.343
What happened?

17:14.409 --> 17:16.679
Um, she got a real job.

17:16.746 --> 17:19.716
Couldn't travel anymore.

17:19.782 --> 17:21.684
The rest of the band?

17:21.751 --> 17:23.352
Ah, bands, man.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.722
They're like
polygamist marriages.

17:25.788 --> 17:26.623
Somebody's getting too much.

17:26.689 --> 17:28.791
Somebody's getting too little.

17:28.858 --> 17:29.926
I don't know.

17:29.993 --> 17:33.395
Oh, look under the
seat right there.

17:36.298 --> 17:37.532
See that?

17:37.600 --> 17:38.735
So I'm thinking we get the
generator running, power

17:38.801 --> 17:41.570
up those batteries,
find a nice quiet spot,

17:41.638 --> 17:43.205
and we record your next album--

17:43.271 --> 17:46.375
Songs From Inside Bonnie.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.275
Thanks.

17:47.342 --> 17:48.011
I'm serious.

17:48.077 --> 17:49.511
Thanks, for everything.

17:49.579 --> 17:54.584
But I think this is the last
ride, if you know what I mean.

17:54.651 --> 17:56.085
What?

17:56.151 --> 17:58.621
You don't write like that and
not share it with the world.

17:58.688 --> 18:00.990
What's the definition
of insanity?

18:01.057 --> 18:04.459
Or as Dylan says, what's the
sound of one hand clapping?

18:07.429 --> 18:08.530
Listen, man.

18:08.598 --> 18:10.767
I've been down the
same road, and I've

18:10.833 --> 18:14.236
been in the bottom
of your empty glass.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.338
I got this great girl
I want to be worthy of.

18:16.405 --> 18:18.775
We want to have a
family, all that.

18:18.841 --> 18:21.911
So finally, I got a real job.

18:21.978 --> 18:25.014
Pays the bills,
benefits, pension.

18:25.081 --> 18:28.584
Wasn't my dream, just like
being an English professor

18:28.651 --> 18:31.253
isn't yours.

18:31.319 --> 18:31.754
But--

18:31.821 --> 18:32.622
Wait.

18:32.689 --> 18:34.957
Your tree job pays benefits?

18:35.024 --> 18:38.493
No-- I got fired from the
job I'm talking about,

18:38.560 --> 18:39.996
but the point is--

18:40.063 --> 18:42.932
you do what you gotta do so
you can keep making music--

18:42.999 --> 18:44.133
weekends, nights, whatever.

18:44.199 --> 18:47.937
But guys like us, we
don't stop making music.

18:48.004 --> 18:49.972
That's the definition
of insanity.

18:57.747 --> 18:59.982
The Big Time Crush, huh?

19:00.049 --> 19:00.817
Ah.

19:00.883 --> 19:02.819
Band names are impossible.

19:02.885 --> 19:03.886
All the good ones
have been taken,

19:03.953 --> 19:06.889
so you end up with
bad sentences.

19:06.956 --> 19:09.357
That's true.

19:09.424 --> 19:11.293
I suppose we need a
name for Eagle Rock?

19:11.359 --> 19:14.529
Well, we're already Rasta
Ganja Brotherhood, right?

19:14.597 --> 19:15.932
Oh, wow.

19:15.998 --> 19:16.799
Hitchhiker.

19:16.866 --> 19:18.567
You don't see that much anymore.

19:18.634 --> 19:19.902
You gotta have a death wish.

19:19.969 --> 19:22.304
Yeah, or be a psycho killer.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.439
Got kind of a hippie
thing going, though.

19:24.506 --> 19:25.507
Like a neo hippie.

19:25.574 --> 19:26.374
The Neo Hippies?

19:26.441 --> 19:27.110
Wait.

19:27.176 --> 19:28.343
What are you doing?

19:28.410 --> 19:29.846
There's not a lot of
hippie psycho killers.

19:29.912 --> 19:31.748
One notable exception.

19:31.814 --> 19:33.015
Charles Manson!

19:33.082 --> 19:36.719
Come on-- Go, go, go.

19:36.786 --> 19:38.621
--Thanks.

19:38.688 --> 19:39.856
How you doing?

19:39.922 --> 19:43.258
I'm Greg, and that's Rich.

19:50.565 --> 19:51.734
Glad we saw you there.

19:51.801 --> 19:55.605
You could have frozen
to death out there, huh?

19:55.671 --> 19:57.539
It's not too bad.

20:08.951 --> 20:09.786
All right.

20:09.852 --> 20:11.286
So you know, I asked for you.

20:11.353 --> 20:14.456
And unfortunately, it looks like
we got the last room in town.

20:14.523 --> 20:15.958
I'm really sorry.

20:16.025 --> 20:17.292
It was nice meeting you.

20:19.561 --> 20:21.998
I'd offer you the van but,
without the generator working,

20:22.064 --> 20:23.331
I'm afraid that you'd
freeze to death--

20:23.398 --> 20:25.935
You know, we could ask
for a cot to be rolled in.

20:28.905 --> 20:29.571
Right on.

20:51.093 --> 20:54.563
Night, Rich.

20:54.630 --> 20:55.798
Night, Greg.

21:06.709 --> 21:08.811
What are you doing?

21:08.878 --> 21:10.046
Couldn't sleep.

21:10.112 --> 21:11.948
So you left me in here--

21:12.014 --> 21:13.749
wait, where did he go?

21:13.816 --> 21:15.084
He was here when I left?

21:15.151 --> 21:16.518
His stuff's gone, though.

21:16.586 --> 21:18.420
Lock the door.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.322
Oh, man.

21:19.387 --> 21:20.756
Scary hippie massacre dreams.

21:23.525 --> 21:25.460
You been working on the song?

21:25.527 --> 21:27.096
I think I finished
the second verse

21:27.163 --> 21:29.866
and have a little
idea for the bridge.

21:29.932 --> 21:30.633
Check it out.

21:34.837 --> 21:35.838
Let's try it.

21:35.905 --> 21:37.039
I was hoping you'd say so.

21:39.742 --> 21:41.543
How about something
like this upfront?

21:48.584 --> 21:49.484
I like it.

22:03.599 --> 22:04.133
Oh--

22:04.200 --> 22:04.867
Whoa, whoa.

22:04.934 --> 22:05.735
Oh.

22:05.801 --> 22:06.736
Morning.

22:06.802 --> 22:07.737
Morning.

22:07.803 --> 22:08.704
Hey.

22:08.771 --> 22:11.941
Oh, oh--

22:12.008 --> 22:17.847
Oh, when you're gone?

22:17.914 --> 22:22.218
The night is cold as it is long.

22:22.285 --> 22:26.722
And the hurt that made you
humble, want to write about,

22:26.789 --> 22:32.228
is the love that made you
crumble from the inside out.

22:32.295 --> 22:39.201
I believe in a new day
to come, that it's always

22:39.268 --> 22:43.139
darkest before the dawn.

22:43.205 --> 22:50.579
Moving in slow motion,
baby, still I'm moving on.

22:50.646 --> 22:54.116
Yeah, yeah.

22:54.183 --> 22:58.154
Moving in slow motion, babe.

22:58.220 --> 23:01.456
Still, I'm moving on.

23:25.247 --> 23:26.916
Sounds nice.

23:26.983 --> 23:28.851
Yeah, nice.

23:28.918 --> 23:31.087
What's next?

23:31.153 --> 23:31.887
Second verse.

23:40.896 --> 23:47.803
Oh, I can see
there ain't no magic words

23:47.870 --> 23:50.840
to set you free.

23:50.906 --> 23:54.076
Still, I'm hoping
you are gonna take me

23:54.143 --> 24:00.716
as I am, even though I am a
fool and such a stubborn man.

24:00.783 --> 24:08.090
I believe in a new day
to come, that it's always

24:08.157 --> 24:12.128
darkest before the dawn.

24:12.194 --> 24:16.065
Moving in slow motion baby.

24:16.132 --> 24:19.168
Still, I'm moving on.

24:23.339 --> 24:27.610
I left New England
for the city life.

24:27.676 --> 24:31.747
Oh, I got songs I wanna sing.

24:31.814 --> 24:33.115
Yeah, I like that.

24:33.182 --> 24:36.085
Then something-- I don't
know what the second part is,

24:36.152 --> 24:38.320
but back to--

24:38.387 --> 24:44.093
Yeah, I got
songs I wanna sing.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.729
Hm, hm.

24:56.839 --> 25:00.643
Yeah I was an Army brat
who didn't care about guns.

25:00.709 --> 25:01.210
Just axes?

25:04.447 --> 25:06.882
And you know, that and
all the moving around,

25:06.949 --> 25:10.753
I just gave up making friends
and started playing the guitar.

25:13.456 --> 25:14.890
Listen.

25:14.957 --> 25:16.258
I don't know when you need to
be wherever it is you're headed,

25:16.325 --> 25:19.428
but if Eagle Rock, Ohio isn't
too far out of your way,

25:19.495 --> 25:20.296
why don't you come with us?

25:20.362 --> 25:21.764
Play the show with us tomorrow.

25:21.831 --> 25:24.366
I mean, we're picking Greg's
girlfriend up in Columbus.

25:24.433 --> 25:27.937
That gives us a day in
the van to rehearse.

25:28.003 --> 25:30.072
Are you going to play
that song for her?

25:30.139 --> 25:32.007
Oh, I don't think it's ready.

25:32.074 --> 25:33.476
We better make it ready.

25:33.542 --> 25:37.279
I wanna see the look on her
face when we rock that baby.

25:37.346 --> 25:39.682
Is that a yes?

25:39.748 --> 25:41.283
Yeah.

25:41.350 --> 25:42.451
All right, then!

25:42.518 --> 25:44.286
I'm going to give
Bonnie her vitamins,

25:44.353 --> 25:47.323
and then we'd better head out.

25:47.389 --> 25:48.958
Yeah, I'll get this stuff.

25:52.862 --> 25:54.330
Do you think anyone
would notice if we

25:54.396 --> 25:56.232
took a little for the road?

25:56.298 --> 25:59.268
You mean, like this?

25:59.335 --> 26:00.035
Come on, dude.

26:03.906 --> 26:05.074
Hey.

26:05.141 --> 26:08.978
Sorry if I freaked you
guys out last night.

26:09.044 --> 26:12.381
Please, you probably had
a early stage hypothermia.

26:12.448 --> 26:15.784
No, but you two definitely
came along at the right moment.

26:21.857 --> 26:24.393
Ah.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.763
We can't leave without--

26:27.830 --> 26:30.933
I just realized I don't
even know your name.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.036
It's Brian.

26:34.103 --> 26:34.770
Hey, Rich.

26:34.837 --> 26:35.471
What are you doing?

26:35.538 --> 26:37.907
We gotta go, bud.

26:37.973 --> 26:40.309
That is weird.

26:40.376 --> 26:42.211
Well, until we think
of something better--

26:42.278 --> 26:42.945
Hey.

26:43.012 --> 26:43.879
What are you doing?

27:02.097 --> 27:06.001
Hello, dear.

27:06.068 --> 27:08.904
It's been a while.

27:08.971 --> 27:15.244
You still got the same smile
that stops me in my tracks.

27:15.311 --> 27:20.115
And you're wearing
your hair a new way.

27:22.851 --> 27:28.324
Well, it's not my taste,
but you're beautiful anyway.

27:28.390 --> 27:36.398
I think I'm writing
a love song for you.

27:36.465 --> 27:40.769
And I'll sing it out,
even if you walk away.

27:43.607 --> 27:45.808
So that's her place?

27:45.874 --> 27:47.276
Yep.

27:47.343 --> 27:49.178
This could take a few minutes,
and I have to pack her up.

27:49.245 --> 27:50.212
I've got to do some work.

27:50.279 --> 27:51.981
Yeah, take your time.

27:52.047 --> 27:54.183
OK.

27:54.250 --> 27:54.883
Thanks.

28:03.492 --> 28:05.094
You want one?

28:05.160 --> 28:05.828
Uh, no.

28:05.894 --> 28:06.395
Thanks.

28:06.462 --> 28:07.296
Mind if I?

28:07.363 --> 28:09.765
Uh, no.

28:14.303 --> 28:15.070
Whoa.

28:15.137 --> 28:17.973
I did not see that coming.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.209
She's a bit older, huh?

28:20.276 --> 28:22.177
Oh.

28:22.244 --> 28:24.380
Well, that makes more sense.

28:24.446 --> 28:25.147
She's pretty.

28:29.251 --> 28:31.120
You guys been together long?

28:31.186 --> 28:32.254
Who?

28:32.321 --> 28:34.123
You and Greg?

28:34.189 --> 28:36.925
Uh, we kind of just met, really.

28:36.992 --> 28:38.160
Really?

28:38.227 --> 28:40.129
You guys sound great together.

28:40.195 --> 28:40.929
It's pretty cool.

28:50.172 --> 28:51.006
Everything all right?

28:53.942 --> 28:56.478
Is your girlfriend coming?

29:22.137 --> 29:25.107
I think we're just a few hours
out of Eagle Rock now, guys.

29:25.174 --> 29:27.910
If you find a motel
up there, we can stop.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.579
Why don't we sleep in here?

29:29.646 --> 29:32.548
Uh, it's a bit cold without
the generator, I think.

29:32.615 --> 29:35.050
Check this place out.

29:35.117 --> 29:35.685
Look at that--

29:35.752 --> 29:36.985
"Music Night"

29:37.052 --> 29:38.187
It's a sign.

29:38.253 --> 29:40.356
Yeah, literally.

29:41.857 --> 29:46.663
And if you feel
foolish, just set it aside.

29:46.730 --> 29:50.933
And put one foot
forward tonight.

29:50.999 --> 29:51.668
Have a seat.

29:51.735 --> 29:52.401
Do you guys want a beer?

29:52.468 --> 29:52.901
Not for me, thanks.

29:52.968 --> 29:53.469
Yeah.

29:53.535 --> 29:56.205
Right on.

29:56.271 --> 29:58.941
There's some food left
over too, if you want it.

29:59.007 --> 30:05.381
Come on and put
one foot forward tonight.

30:05.447 --> 30:11.019
And put one foot
forward tonight.

30:22.297 --> 30:24.299
Who the fuck are you?

30:24.366 --> 30:28.470
Come to me, darling,
put your hand in mine.

30:28.537 --> 30:30.572
Lay your head down
on my shoulder.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.241
Give me your lips,
sweet like wine.

30:32.307 --> 30:33.575
If a kiss is just a kiss.

30:36.178 --> 30:40.549
I don't know what
to make of this.

30:40.617 --> 30:45.053
Although the radio
plays only a storm.

30:47.556 --> 30:54.764
Still somewhere, I hear
the downbeat of a drum.

30:54.831 --> 30:59.268
So dance with me to this song.

30:59.334 --> 31:03.439
Dance now, darling,
let your cares be gone.

31:03.505 --> 31:07.409
Dance with me all night long.

31:07.476 --> 31:11.380
Dance, now darling,
to this song.

31:15.083 --> 31:15.350
Ah.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.301
Check out this little baby, huh?

31:35.504 --> 31:37.306
She was
a friend of mine.

31:37.372 --> 31:39.274
She was a friend of mine.

31:39.341 --> 31:40.576
Roll down the river.

31:40.643 --> 31:41.778
She was a friend of mine.

31:41.845 --> 31:47.584
Roll down the river,
roll where you can.

31:47.650 --> 31:48.685
Roll down.

31:48.751 --> 31:51.453
It all comes back again.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.454
Whew!

31:52.521 --> 31:54.089
All right!

31:57.392 --> 31:58.327
Guys?

31:59.394 --> 32:00.597
Hey, guys!

32:00.663 --> 32:02.564
Um, yes?

32:02.632 --> 32:04.266
You'd better come downstairs.

32:10.239 --> 32:10.640
What's wrong?

32:10.707 --> 32:12.207
No idea.

32:12.274 --> 32:13.075
Oh, man.

32:13.141 --> 32:14.777
Guys, you'd better come now.

32:14.844 --> 32:16.478
I asked you to stay
with the vehicle.

32:16.545 --> 32:17.680
You know what?

32:17.747 --> 32:18.848
I don't have to do
anything you say, OK?

32:18.915 --> 32:19.916
I've asked you to
remain with the vehicle.

32:19.983 --> 32:22.284
You know, it
doesn't even matter.

32:22.351 --> 32:23.352
I'm on private property.

32:23.418 --> 32:24.821
You can't just roll
up, wake me up--

32:24.888 --> 32:25.420
Oh, yes.

32:25.487 --> 32:26.154
Oh, yes, I can.

32:26.221 --> 32:27.422
No, you can't, man.

32:27.489 --> 32:28.257
Oh, you think it's
because you have a badge,

32:28.323 --> 32:30.627
you can just make shit up?

32:30.693 --> 32:31.861
This is bullshit.
I need you to calm down.

32:31.928 --> 32:33.328
You need to go back
to the academy, dude,

32:33.395 --> 32:36.098
because you were asleep the day
they talked about civil rights.

32:36.164 --> 32:37.834
Do either of you know this man?

32:37.901 --> 32:39.769
Um, what's the problem?

32:39.836 --> 32:43.372
Who's the owner of this vehicle?

32:43.438 --> 32:46.441
I need your license and
registration, please.

32:46.508 --> 32:47.276
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:47.342 --> 32:48.410
This isn't a traffic stop.

32:48.477 --> 32:49.244
He doesn't have to
show you anything.

32:49.311 --> 32:50.279
Brian, it's totally cool.

32:50.345 --> 32:52.047
There's nothing
to hide here, OK?

32:52.114 --> 32:52.916
That's not the point.

32:52.982 --> 32:55.217
Sir, you need to stand down now.

32:55.284 --> 32:56.451
Stand down.

32:56.518 --> 32:57.921
What the fuck does that
even mean, stand down?

32:57.987 --> 33:00.489
Yeah, well, I know sitting down,
and I know standing up, OK?

33:00.556 --> 33:02.025
But how do I "stand down"?

33:02.090 --> 33:04.761
I mean, the last I checked, we
speak English in America, OK?

33:04.827 --> 33:05.962
And we had this little thing.

33:06.029 --> 33:07.730
It's called the Constitution.
All right.

33:07.797 --> 33:08.898
You stay here.

33:08.965 --> 33:10.465
Maybe you can calm
your friend down.

33:10.532 --> 33:11.466
I'll be right back.

33:14.369 --> 33:16.438
This fucking guy--

33:16.505 --> 33:17.439
Brian, what's going on?

33:17.506 --> 33:18.473
Yeah.

33:18.540 --> 33:19.341
Let's maybe chill
a bit and, uh--

33:19.408 --> 33:20.843
do you wanna put some pants on?

33:25.247 --> 33:26.049
Hey, Copper.

33:26.114 --> 33:27.215
I'm gonna put some pants on.

33:27.282 --> 33:30.385
Or is that going to
be a problem too?

33:30.452 --> 33:32.454
Tampering with evidence.

33:32.521 --> 33:34.189
Failure to stand down.

33:34.256 --> 33:35.925
Concealing a weapon, maybe.

33:35.992 --> 33:37.894
Look, guys, there's
no law in America

33:37.961 --> 33:41.196
that says you can't sleep in
a van on private property, OK?

33:41.263 --> 33:42.732
He's profiling.

33:42.799 --> 33:45.367
He can't do anything to me for
out-of-state parking tickets,

33:45.434 --> 33:46.468
can he?

33:46.535 --> 33:47.637
That's just a
misdemeanor, right?

33:47.704 --> 33:48.236
No.

33:48.303 --> 33:49.005
Parking tickets?

33:49.072 --> 33:49.906
That's an infraction.

33:49.973 --> 33:51.306
Doesn't even show up on NCIC.

33:51.373 --> 33:55.712
Look guys, I'm not trying
to make trouble here, OK?

33:55.778 --> 33:56.813
He woke me up for no reason.

33:56.879 --> 33:59.214
And now he's totally
overreaching.

33:59.281 --> 34:01.618
If we don't leave now, we're
going to miss this gig.

34:01.684 --> 34:02.484
All right, look.

34:02.551 --> 34:03.686
Let's just be cool with him.

34:03.753 --> 34:06.756
And maybe he's gonna
be cool with us, OK?

34:06.823 --> 34:10.192
So what brings you
fellas to this area?

34:10.258 --> 34:12.629
We're playing the Eagle
Rock Folk Festival.

34:12.695 --> 34:13.763
I see.

34:13.830 --> 34:15.632
Is that what this is?

34:15.698 --> 34:17.232
Oh, some kids
graffiti'd that, and--

34:17.299 --> 34:18.635
You don't have to
answer him, OK?

34:18.701 --> 34:19.501
He's just fishing.

34:19.568 --> 34:21.570
I'm not talking to you, sir.

34:21.638 --> 34:23.640
No, but I'm talking to you, OK?

34:23.706 --> 34:25.240
Because we have free
speech in America.

34:25.307 --> 34:26.643
Or seriously, did we
take a wrong turn?

34:26.709 --> 34:27.275
What happened to being cool?

34:27.342 --> 34:28.778
You know what?

34:28.845 --> 34:30.178
And why am I the only one that
gives a shit about our rights?!

34:30.245 --> 34:32.015
I'm going to give you one
last chance to calm down,

34:32.081 --> 34:33.281
or you're coming with me.

34:33.348 --> 34:34.516
For what?

34:34.584 --> 34:35.852
For harassing a police
officer, for one thing.

34:35.918 --> 34:39.254
Oh yeah, we're-- do you
believe we're harassing him?

34:39.321 --> 34:40.555
I'm minding my own business.

34:40.623 --> 34:41.624
You come up to me.

34:41.691 --> 34:42.859
What the fuck is going on?
Look.

34:42.925 --> 34:44.359
You're about to get arrested!
Get off me!

34:46.596 --> 34:48.765
You want to let this
asshole trample your rights?

34:48.831 --> 34:51.333
Fine!

34:51.400 --> 34:53.368
Am I free to go?

34:53.435 --> 34:55.237
Hey, are you gonna
arrest me for sleeping?

34:55.303 --> 34:56.873
Or am I free to get
my shit and walk?

34:56.939 --> 34:58.573
You can get your
shit and go, please.

35:03.378 --> 35:04.580
Come on, Brian.

35:04.647 --> 35:05.347
Brian?

35:05.414 --> 35:06.616
Hey, where you going?

35:06.683 --> 35:10.720
Where-- where you going?

35:10.787 --> 35:12.320
He's a piece of work, huh?

35:16.025 --> 35:18.527
I'm sorry, Officer.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.462
We just met him, really.

35:20.529 --> 35:22.832
If everything's cool, we're
just going to get our stuff.

35:22.899 --> 35:24.332
We're going to go.

35:24.399 --> 35:25.935
We're going to get him, and then
we're going to get to our gig.

35:26.002 --> 35:27.937
Afraid I can't let you do that.

35:28.004 --> 35:29.806
Uh, you just said
he was free to go.

35:29.872 --> 35:30.539
Yes, he is.

35:30.606 --> 35:31.841
But this van isn't.

35:31.908 --> 35:33.943
Registration on this
vehicle has been revoked.

35:34.010 --> 35:35.678
And there's a warrant
waiting for you,

35:35.745 --> 35:37.512
sir, when you get home.

35:37.580 --> 35:39.816
The only way this vehicle
is going any place today

35:39.882 --> 35:42.819
is on the back of a tow truck.

35:42.885 --> 35:44.854
Your license.

35:44.921 --> 35:45.722
Excuse me a minute.

36:11.114 --> 36:14.851
Guess who's gonna
tow me back tomorrow?

36:14.917 --> 36:16.853
Alvin, from the
party last night.

36:16.919 --> 36:17.720
Are you serious?

36:17.787 --> 36:20.322
How funny is that?

36:20.388 --> 36:22.725
Oh, and they're actually going
to let me sleep in the van

36:22.792 --> 36:24.426
tonight right here
in the pound lot.

36:24.493 --> 36:25.595
OK.

36:25.661 --> 36:28.330
I mean, that is irony, huh?

36:28.396 --> 36:29.599
I mean, that is irony, right?

36:32.702 --> 36:34.604
Did you find a bus?

36:34.670 --> 36:35.905
Yeah.

36:35.972 --> 36:37.740
It leaves from just down
there in about 15 minutes.

36:37.807 --> 36:38.507
Oh, wow.

36:38.573 --> 36:39.742
You better get going.

36:39.809 --> 36:40.910
Listen.

36:40.977 --> 36:41.844
Let me help you pay
for the tow bill.

36:41.911 --> 36:43.579
Please.
This is not your fault.

36:43.646 --> 36:44.213
No.

36:44.279 --> 36:45.047
You're tight.

36:45.114 --> 36:46.448
I can lend you some money.

36:46.515 --> 36:48.751
Kelly wired me.

36:48.818 --> 36:50.887
You spoke to her?

36:50.953 --> 36:51.754
Yeah.

36:51.821 --> 36:54.857
That wasn't funny or ironic.

36:54.924 --> 36:56.491
We're going through
some shit right now,

36:56.558 --> 37:01.030
and she says that she's
not re-upping her lease.

37:01.097 --> 37:05.534
But we're gonna work it out.

37:05.601 --> 37:06.736
Listen.

37:06.803 --> 37:08.570
You're probably going to
be late, even as it is.

37:08.638 --> 37:09.437
Don't worry about me.

37:09.504 --> 37:10.706
I got Alvin and those guys.

37:10.773 --> 37:11.774
I'm going to meet them
for drinks right down

37:11.841 --> 37:15.377
there in a few minutes,
so I'm all good.

37:15.443 --> 37:17.780
Thanks.

37:17.847 --> 37:19.015
For what?

37:19.081 --> 37:21.851
For leaving you high and
dry in bum fuck Ohio?

37:21.918 --> 37:23.518
For everything.

37:26.222 --> 37:28.490
Don't stop the music.

37:37.200 --> 37:42.605
Hey, "RGB"-- world's
shortest lived band, huh?

37:42.672 --> 37:43.438
What'd I tell you?

38:07.196 --> 38:09.031
Oh-- Hi Mrs. Markey.

38:12.835 --> 38:13.736
Excuse me.

38:16.205 --> 38:17.773
Does this go too?

38:17.840 --> 38:18.674
Everything goes, man.

38:49.939 --> 38:50.940
Hi, Mom.

38:51.007 --> 38:52.808
I'm all right.

38:52.875 --> 38:55.510
Sorry, I spent the weekend
in the library and the cell

38:55.578 --> 38:58.147
phone's on the fritz again.

38:58.214 --> 39:00.182
But I'm good.

39:00.249 --> 39:02.618
Actually, I've kind of
turned over a new leaf,

39:02.685 --> 39:04.053
as Dad would say.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.221
And what did he say, by the way?

39:05.288 --> 39:09.759
The man who rises
early feels honest?

39:09.825 --> 39:11.861
That's the right word, I think.

39:11.928 --> 39:15.598
You'll be happy to know I'm
eating better, and making

39:15.665 --> 39:18.834
sure to get some
exercise every day,

39:18.901 --> 39:20.535
and having some
real breakthroughs

39:20.603 --> 39:22.038
with my undergrad
students lately.

39:22.104 --> 39:23.571
Anyone?

39:23.639 --> 39:24.273
Anybody?

39:24.340 --> 39:24.740
Which is exciting.

39:24.807 --> 39:26.742
Anyone?

39:26.809 --> 39:29.511
Nobody?

39:29.578 --> 39:31.781
And you know, even
Professor Green and I are--

39:31.847 --> 39:33.783
How nice of you to join us.

39:33.849 --> 39:35.985
Well, I wouldn't say we're
playing the same tune exactly

39:36.052 --> 39:41.958
yet, but I think there's a
mutual thing happening there,

39:42.024 --> 39:45.027
which brings me to this point.

39:45.094 --> 39:47.163
You were right, Mom.

39:47.229 --> 39:50.032
Music wasn't good for me.

39:50.099 --> 39:51.434
In retrospect, I
should have been

39:51.499 --> 39:54.804
able to read the signs on
that one a long time ago.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.973
Call me after bingo tonight?

40:16.659 --> 40:17.293
Oh.
Sorry.

40:17.360 --> 40:18.027
Hi.

40:18.094 --> 40:19.261
I'm sorry to bother you.

40:19.328 --> 40:20.863
I used to live right next door.
Yeah, I know.

40:20.930 --> 40:21.731
You're--

40:21.797 --> 40:24.700
Oh, did we meet?

40:24.767 --> 40:25.835
Uh, no.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.003
We just passed in the hall.

40:27.069 --> 40:29.672
Well, I should have
introduced myself.

40:29.739 --> 40:32.608
Anyway, I'm sorry to
bother you, but would you

40:32.675 --> 40:37.580
mind terribly holding this
for a friend to come pick up?

40:37.646 --> 40:39.248
I came back to tie
up a few loose ends,

40:39.315 --> 40:40.750
and I was supposed
to meet up with him.

40:40.816 --> 40:44.854
And I can't reach him, and I
really want him to have this.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.022
But I can't leave it the hall.

40:46.088 --> 40:46.655
So--

40:46.722 --> 40:47.923
Yeah, you bet.

40:47.990 --> 40:49.025
Thank you.

40:49.091 --> 40:51.160
Hopefully, I can
reach him, and then he

40:51.227 --> 40:53.729
can come get it really soon.

40:53.796 --> 40:55.631
Of course, anytime.

40:55.698 --> 40:56.866
Thank you.

41:03.239 --> 41:04.874
Triple A Tree care.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.208
Yes, hi.

41:06.275 --> 41:08.744
Do you have someone named
Greg working for you?

41:08.811 --> 41:09.378
No.

41:09.445 --> 41:09.945
No?

41:10.012 --> 41:10.413
No, sorry.

41:10.479 --> 41:10.980
OK.

41:11.047 --> 41:11.580
Thank you.

41:15.217 --> 41:16.752
Yes, hi.

41:16.819 --> 41:19.021
I'm looking for a
friend named Greg.

41:19.088 --> 41:21.857
Does he work for you?

41:21.924 --> 41:23.059
No?

41:23.125 --> 41:24.593
Yes, hi.

41:24.660 --> 41:29.632
I'm looking for someone named
Greg that might work for you.

41:29.698 --> 41:30.900
Yes.

41:30.966 --> 41:32.101
Yes, that's him.

41:32.168 --> 41:34.270
Do you know where he's
working right now?

41:44.280 --> 41:46.148
She's been offered a new job.

41:46.215 --> 41:47.917
OK, that's good.

41:47.983 --> 41:48.818
In London.

41:50.953 --> 41:52.655
England.

41:52.721 --> 41:54.957
Sorry, man.

41:55.024 --> 41:58.094
I don't think she's really
going to move to London.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.862
I think she's just
trying to, um--

42:02.865 --> 42:05.868
listen, thank you for
bringing this to me.

42:05.935 --> 42:07.369
I think I'm kind of beat.

42:07.436 --> 42:12.108
I'm going to maybe take off, but
I'll give you a call sometime

42:12.174 --> 42:13.008
soon, OK?

42:13.075 --> 42:13.742
What?

42:13.809 --> 42:15.111
You've got a phone?

42:15.177 --> 42:16.312
No.

42:16.378 --> 42:18.881
I'm saving up, but
I'll give you a call.

42:21.283 --> 42:23.219
I should get going too, I guess.

42:23.285 --> 42:25.287
Gotta get back to
my dissertation.

42:25.354 --> 42:25.988
Oh right.

42:26.055 --> 42:27.223
How's that going?

42:27.289 --> 42:28.057
Good.

42:28.124 --> 42:30.960
Two weeks till my defense.

42:31.026 --> 42:31.527
I got it.

42:31.595 --> 42:32.128
Oh, great.

42:32.194 --> 42:32.728
Yeah, I got it.

42:32.795 --> 42:33.562
No, no, no.

42:33.629 --> 42:37.133
No, no, please, I want to.

42:37.199 --> 42:38.701
Thanks, man.

42:38.767 --> 42:41.203
I'll put it toward
the phone fund.

42:41.270 --> 42:42.671
Look, I'm going to hit
the head on the way out.

42:42.738 --> 42:48.210
So if I don't catch you, you
take care, all right, buddy?

42:48.277 --> 42:48.944
Hey, Greg.

42:49.011 --> 42:49.579
Do you want to call her?

42:49.645 --> 42:50.880
Take my phone.

42:50.946 --> 42:52.014
Seriously.

42:52.081 --> 42:53.349
Keep it overnight.

42:53.415 --> 42:55.718
The only person that calls
this phone is my mom.

42:55.784 --> 42:59.088
If she calls, don't answer.

42:59.155 --> 43:01.190
Listen, I'm cool.

43:01.257 --> 43:04.059
Thank you, though, OK?

43:04.126 --> 43:04.827
Take care.

43:04.894 --> 43:06.896
I'm going to call you.

43:06.962 --> 43:08.898
Right?

43:08.964 --> 43:09.899
You too.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.314
Hey.

43:25.381 --> 43:26.515
Everything all right?

43:26.583 --> 43:29.351
You'll never believe this.

43:33.322 --> 43:37.359
I didn't know this
place was down here.

43:37.426 --> 43:48.537
My love, I've
run out of things to say.

43:48.605 --> 43:54.777
Neither one is right.

43:54.843 --> 44:01.183
Is it just a waste of time?

44:01.250 --> 44:06.755
Is this love worth the fight?

44:14.396 --> 44:15.497
Nice one, Brian.

44:19.401 --> 44:20.569
Holy shit.

44:20.637 --> 44:21.870
Guys, can we take a quick break.

44:21.937 --> 44:25.474
I recognized your voice
immediately, but the rest

44:25.541 --> 44:26.942
of you not so much.

44:27.009 --> 44:27.576
Yeah, man.

44:27.644 --> 44:29.178
You look good.

44:29.245 --> 44:30.079
Thanks.

44:30.145 --> 44:32.047
How long you staying in town?

44:32.114 --> 44:33.382
Just till Friday.

44:33.449 --> 44:35.351
I'm crashing with James
until he goes into the Army.

44:35.417 --> 44:36.118
The bassist.

44:36.185 --> 44:37.453
Whoa, as in the Army?

44:37.519 --> 44:40.222
You know, the music thing
didn't really pan out.

44:40.289 --> 44:42.858
He needed to do
something drastic.

44:42.925 --> 44:44.293
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

44:44.360 --> 44:45.894
I never got your contact info.

44:45.961 --> 44:46.428
Hey, Bri--?

44:47.529 --> 44:48.564
It's time, man.

44:48.632 --> 44:49.131
Cool.

44:51.433 --> 44:52.368
Shoot.

44:52.434 --> 44:54.203
Can you guys hang out?

44:54.270 --> 44:55.971
Better yet, you
guys should sit in.

44:56.038 --> 44:57.106
Oh, I, um--

44:57.172 --> 44:57.973
Aw, come on.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.141
James would totally dig it.

44:59.208 --> 45:01.377
And the bar picks
up in a little bit.

45:06.248 --> 45:08.350
So we have a couple more
special guests tonight.

45:08.417 --> 45:11.887
I just met these guys, but Brian
says great things about them.

45:11.954 --> 45:15.057
Let's get a round of
applause for Rich and, uh--

45:15.124 --> 45:15.625
Greg.

45:15.692 --> 45:16.091
Greg.

45:16.158 --> 45:16.792
Come on.

45:16.859 --> 45:18.260
Come on up, guys.

45:26.468 --> 45:28.971
So what are we gonna play?

45:29.038 --> 45:32.141
Do you guys remember that tune
I was working on when I met you?

45:32.207 --> 45:33.677
Aw, come on.

45:33.743 --> 45:37.446
Emily, can we get a couple of
frosty pints of liquid courage

45:37.513 --> 45:39.548
for my friends here?

45:39.616 --> 45:42.151
It was capo five.

45:42.217 --> 45:45.020
F to A minor.

45:45.087 --> 45:47.423
One, two.

46:06.208 --> 46:09.478
I've had this bike
for years I patched the tubes.

46:09.545 --> 46:16.185
Fixed the gears
Made the light shine

46:16.251 --> 46:23.926
bright to scare away
the demons in the night.

46:23.992 --> 46:27.996
Rode by your house
safe and warm.

46:28.063 --> 46:31.934
Looked in a window,
but nobody was home.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.605
I know you left long ago.

46:35.672 --> 46:40.677
But the reasons why
you left, nobody knows.

46:40.744 --> 46:44.246
Houses look different at night.

46:44.313 --> 46:46.215
Maybe it's the wine.

46:46.281 --> 46:48.685
Maybe it's the light.

46:48.752 --> 46:52.454
Take another spin
around the block.

46:52.521 --> 46:55.090
Got nowhere to be.

46:55.157 --> 46:57.359
Sold my watch.

46:57.426 --> 47:00.630
The currency of
love is counterfeit.

47:00.697 --> 47:05.635
You take that away,
it still hurts a bit.

47:05.702 --> 47:09.071
I'd like to patch this
hole inside my heart.

47:09.138 --> 47:10.673
I'm getting old.

47:10.740 --> 47:14.042
It's too late to start.

47:18.414 --> 47:21.316
It's too late to start.

48:01.825 --> 48:04.594
It's too late to start.

48:09.799 --> 48:13.402
It's too late to start.

48:16.472 --> 48:19.676
...And we bid you good night.

48:19.742 --> 48:23.312
Good night.

48:34.556 --> 48:37.292
Oh, all right.

48:37.359 --> 48:39.596
James, you headed
over to McClenon's?

48:39.662 --> 48:41.330
Yeah, let's do this.

48:41.396 --> 48:42.097
Bri, you coming?

48:42.164 --> 48:43.165
I'll see you in five.

48:43.232 --> 48:44.399
Good luck.
Hey, be safe, all right?

48:45.434 --> 48:48.203
Guys, that was--
that was awesome.

48:48.270 --> 48:50.506
Let's not part without
exchanging info.

48:50.572 --> 48:52.174
You got a phone now?

48:52.241 --> 48:53.375
Uh, no.

48:53.442 --> 48:54.243
Greg?

48:54.309 --> 48:55.544
Saving up.

48:55.612 --> 48:57.179
I guess you guys are
going to have to call me.

48:57.246 --> 48:58.280
Well, here.

48:58.347 --> 48:59.314
Put your number down.

48:59.381 --> 49:01.016
I gotta pack up a
few more things.

49:04.186 --> 49:04.988
Oh, hey.

49:05.053 --> 49:06.421
We'll be out in two minutes, OK?

49:11.560 --> 49:13.630
Can I help you?

49:13.696 --> 49:15.598
I think you already have.

49:15.665 --> 49:17.499
Gentlemen, my name is
James Matthew Granmer,

49:17.566 --> 49:19.368
but my friends call me Granny.

49:19.434 --> 49:20.302
Granny?
Granny.

49:20.369 --> 49:20.837
Granny.

49:20.904 --> 49:21.871
Listen.

49:21.938 --> 49:24.874
What the fuck were
you guys doing?

49:24.941 --> 49:27.142
I just stopped in for 10
minutes just to escape.

49:27.209 --> 49:31.513
The last thing I expected
was to find you guys.

49:31.581 --> 49:32.414
Oh, wow.
--Thanks.

49:32.481 --> 49:33.048
Thank you.

49:33.115 --> 49:35.317
No, thank you.

49:35.384 --> 49:36.184
Shit.
Shit.

49:36.251 --> 49:37.519
We've gotta go to this showcase.

49:37.587 --> 49:38.988
I don't even wanna go to it.

49:39.054 --> 49:43.125
What I want to do is stay
here, find out more about you.

49:43.191 --> 49:44.794
Well actually, they're
closing the bar.

49:44.861 --> 49:46.763
So we're walking out,
if you want to join us.

49:46.829 --> 49:48.263
Yeah, that would be terrific.
OK.

49:48.330 --> 49:49.298
I'll follow you.

49:50.332 --> 49:51.533
Who's seen you guys?

49:51.601 --> 49:52.301
Sorry.

49:52.367 --> 49:53.435
Who's seen us do what?

49:53.502 --> 49:54.403
You signed?

49:54.469 --> 49:55.304
Uh, no.

49:56.338 --> 49:57.105
Publishing?

49:57.172 --> 49:59.408
Uh, you mean publishing--

49:59.474 --> 50:00.610
Got a publishing deal?

50:00.677 --> 50:02.544
This is actually our
first gig together.

50:02.612 --> 50:03.780
You're bullshitting me.

50:03.846 --> 50:07.182
Georgie, this is their
first gig together.

50:07.249 --> 50:08.051
I'm sorry.

50:08.116 --> 50:09.451
This is my friend, Georgie.

50:09.518 --> 50:11.486
Georgie loves you guys.

50:11.553 --> 50:12.220
He's got great ears.

50:12.287 --> 50:13.590
He's from Colombia.

50:13.656 --> 50:14.389
Oh, wow.

50:14.456 --> 50:15.424
Yeah.

50:15.490 --> 50:16.325
Listen.

50:16.391 --> 50:17.727
I get what you guys are doing.

50:17.794 --> 50:19.829
Three part harmony?

50:19.896 --> 50:20.997
Nobody does that anymore.

50:21.064 --> 50:22.431
It's very retro, but
you're excellent.

50:22.497 --> 50:25.534
And I think your time is great,
and I don't like anything.

50:25.602 --> 50:26.368
Ask Georgie.

50:26.435 --> 50:27.604
Am I right?
No I--

50:27.670 --> 50:28.671
What are you doing here?
I don't like anything.

50:28.738 --> 50:30.439
But um-- was I
just talking here?

50:30.505 --> 50:31.641
I was.

50:31.708 --> 50:32.875
I'm going to go settle
up at the bar, OK?

50:37.580 --> 50:39.682
So you're from Columbia?

50:39.749 --> 50:41.483
Yes.

50:41.550 --> 50:42.317
A & R?

50:42.384 --> 50:42.819
Yes.

50:47.456 --> 50:48.758
Thank you, sweetheart.

50:48.825 --> 50:50.593
So you're visiting from L.A.?

50:50.660 --> 50:51.460
Yeah, just for the night.

50:51.526 --> 50:53.261
I have to see another show.

50:53.328 --> 50:54.731
Excuse me.

50:54.797 --> 50:56.633
Guys, do you mind if I steal
this gentleman for a second?

50:56.699 --> 50:58.868
I have to run,
but I got an idea.

50:58.935 --> 51:01.704
What do you say you
do a showcase in LA.

51:01.771 --> 51:03.538
I'm thinking "The Troubadour"?

51:03.606 --> 51:04.272
Yeah.

51:04.339 --> 51:05.008
Wait.

51:05.074 --> 51:05.507
Like The Troubadour?

51:05.574 --> 51:06.241
Yeah.

51:06.308 --> 51:06.943
I think it sounds great.

51:07.010 --> 51:08.377
What do you think?

51:08.443 --> 51:09.746
Uh, well.

51:09.812 --> 51:10.312
LA is--

51:10.379 --> 51:11.179
I'm sorry.

51:11.246 --> 51:12.280
Do you mind if we walk and talk?

51:12.347 --> 51:13.616
I follow you,
because honestly, I

51:13.683 --> 51:17.419
don't know how I got down
this rabbit shit hole.

51:17.486 --> 51:23.225
Listen, I'm busy the next 48,
so we'll talk before I fly out.

51:23.291 --> 51:24.827
What's the name of
your band anyway?

51:24.894 --> 51:27.630
Well, we've been
using the name RGB.

51:27.697 --> 51:28.430
R & B?

51:28.497 --> 51:29.564
RGB.

51:29.632 --> 51:30.767
Rich, Greg, Brian.

51:30.833 --> 51:31.901
Yeah, but it's also
red, green, blue,

51:31.968 --> 51:33.402
which are the only
three colors that

51:33.468 --> 51:36.338
can be blended to create any
color in the visible spectrum,

51:36.405 --> 51:38.540
or the aural spectrum
in this case.

51:38.608 --> 51:39.142
All right.

51:39.207 --> 51:39.876
Yeah, great.

51:39.942 --> 51:40.610
We'll work on that.

51:40.677 --> 51:41.576
--Good night, gentlemen.

51:42.477 --> 51:43.646
Here's my card.

51:43.713 --> 51:45.547
How do I get in touch
with you gentlemen?

51:45.615 --> 51:46.381
Oh, sorry.

51:46.448 --> 51:47.482
Here's my cell.

51:47.549 --> 51:48.350
OK, great.

51:48.417 --> 51:48.985
What about the bass player?

51:49.052 --> 51:49.819
Where'd he go?

51:49.886 --> 51:51.788
He's going into the Army.

51:51.854 --> 51:53.388
Well, that's probably
for the best.

51:53.455 --> 51:54.456
How about your drummer?

51:54.523 --> 51:56.793
You got anybody
with big boy drums?

51:56.859 --> 51:57.960
You mean for LA?

51:58.027 --> 51:59.294
Yeah, I think we're
going to need it.

51:59.361 --> 52:00.462
Georgie?

52:00.529 --> 52:01.864
We're going to need
drums, aren't we?

52:01.931 --> 52:03.066
We need percussion.

52:03.132 --> 52:05.034
Yeah, get the people
tapping their toes.

52:05.101 --> 52:06.803
You'll work on that, right?

52:06.869 --> 52:08.938
I'll tell you-- look at him.

52:09.005 --> 52:09.639
Look at Georgie.

52:09.706 --> 52:10.907
He's all riled up.

52:10.973 --> 52:12.608
He never gets like this.

52:12.675 --> 52:13.710
You guys are great.

52:13.776 --> 52:14.911
OK, we'll talk to you.

52:14.977 --> 52:17.780
Give me a call, and
we'll see you in LA.

52:17.847 --> 52:18.815
Good night, gentlemen.

52:18.881 --> 52:19.649
Good night.

52:19.716 --> 52:20.917
Hey, good night.

52:23.653 --> 52:25.688
The Troubadour!

52:25.755 --> 52:32.829
Interstellar Music Enterprises,
Los Angeles, California.

52:32.895 --> 52:35.665
We can't do this, can we?

52:35.732 --> 52:39.702
Listen, I don't know if you guys
believe in signs, or whatever,

52:39.769 --> 52:40.803
but this is crazy.

52:40.870 --> 52:41.971
I mean, isn't it?

52:42.038 --> 52:42.739
The whole thing.

52:42.805 --> 52:43.840
Good you're all there.

52:43.906 --> 52:44.539
Listen.

52:44.607 --> 52:45.708
I got you the gig.

52:45.775 --> 52:47.076
The Troubadour?

52:47.143 --> 52:47.542
--Wow.

52:47.610 --> 52:48.044
Awesome.

52:48.111 --> 52:48.678
Yeah.

52:48.745 --> 52:49.511
Well OK-- no.

52:49.579 --> 52:50.245
The Troubadour was booked.

52:50.312 --> 52:52.648
This is "Bob's Crepery".

52:52.715 --> 52:54.549
This is probably better though.

52:54.617 --> 52:55.585
Yeah.

52:55.651 --> 52:56.318
And the crepes are
pretty good too.

52:56.384 --> 52:57.854
Now listen, please.

52:57.920 --> 52:59.554
The gig is Monday night.

53:00.522 --> 53:01.456
As in next Monday?

53:01.523 --> 53:02.191
I know.

53:02.257 --> 53:03.525
I know that's soon.

53:03.593 --> 53:04.861
But the record guys take
off early for the holidays,

53:04.927 --> 53:05.728
you know?

53:05.795 --> 53:07.130
What holidays?

53:07.196 --> 53:09.564
--you're going to be on at
6:00, prime showcase hour.

53:09.632 --> 53:12.935
And the Melons are doing a
special PR deal right after ya.

53:13.636 --> 53:14.070
The Melons?

53:14.137 --> 53:14.436
--Oh wow

53:15.138 --> 53:15.671
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:15.738 --> 53:16.773
It's great.

53:16.839 --> 53:17.940
Oh, listen-- I
lined up a drummer!

53:18.007 --> 53:20.542
young studio cat,
very hot right now.

53:20.610 --> 53:21.778
And he owes me.

53:21.844 --> 53:23.012
He's just going to just
do simple percussion,

53:23.079 --> 53:25.815
keep it focused on the
harmonies and the songs.

53:25.882 --> 53:27.116
Listen to me.

53:27.183 --> 53:28.618
I'm out of the country for
the next couple of days.

53:28.684 --> 53:31.921
I'm gonna call you Saturday at
noon to go over the details.

53:31.988 --> 53:33.122
Shit.
I gotta take another call.

53:33.189 --> 53:35.524
OK, so come out here,
and let's get you

53:35.591 --> 53:39.461
in front of some cats who can
send this shit to Neptune.

53:39.528 --> 53:40.096
Damelo!

53:40.163 --> 53:40.963
Hey, cuidado!

53:50.940 --> 53:54.710
I mean, flights at
this point would be?--

53:54.777 --> 53:57.113
If we drive, we gotta leave
like Thursday, at the latest.

53:57.180 --> 53:58.581
I'm gonna get fired, for sure.

53:58.648 --> 54:01.117
And you've got your classes
and your dissertation thing,

54:01.184 --> 54:02.718
or whatever, right?

54:08.090 --> 54:09.625
I'm gonna need to
do some laundry.

54:25.675 --> 54:29.011
We were walking
down at Broadgate hall,

54:29.078 --> 54:32.048
yellow hat and your
Cashmere shawl.

54:32.114 --> 54:35.685
A broken sky's turned gray.

54:38.254 --> 54:41.791
Bus stop squeals, and
telephone wires, cafe lights

54:41.858 --> 54:45.094
on the Christ church spires.

54:45.161 --> 54:48.097
Somewhere, we lost our way.

54:52.101 --> 54:56.739
It's time we turn
this ship around.

54:56.806 --> 55:02.778
Oh, I know, I know, I know.

55:02.845 --> 55:09.451
It's been too good for way
too long to say goodbye.

55:09.517 --> 55:17.126
Hey, I mean every word I
say, that it's been too good,

55:17.193 --> 55:24.834
for way too long to say
goodbye, oh, say goodbye.

55:24.901 --> 55:25.433
Here you go.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.837
Take it all!

55:27.904 --> 55:29.005
No, this isn't enough.

55:29.071 --> 55:30.606
The paper said 600.

55:30.673 --> 55:31.707
No, it's $1,000.

55:31.774 --> 55:32.808
It was $600 a
couple of weeks ago.

55:32.875 --> 55:33.541
$1,000 bucks?

55:33.609 --> 55:34.744
Now you got the storage.

55:34.810 --> 55:36.045
Now we got--
You think because you're a cop--

55:36.112 --> 55:37.780
We'll meet you out there.
This is ridiculous!

55:41.684 --> 55:44.987
Looking back
on a faded photograph,

55:45.054 --> 55:48.157
on the walk by the boats
where I made you laugh,

55:48.224 --> 55:53.428
there in my mind I
go from time to time.

56:04.273 --> 56:09.812
Yes, I go from time to time.

56:09.879 --> 56:18.087
Oh, I know, I know, I know,
it's been too good for way

56:18.154 --> 56:21.123
too long to say goodbye.

56:21.190 --> 56:22.457
--What the fuck is this?

56:27.663 --> 56:28.931
Let's go.

56:28.998 --> 56:35.004
Been too good way
too long to say goodbye.

56:35.071 --> 56:40.810
Been too good way too
long to say goodbye.

56:40.876 --> 56:46.615
It's been too good way
too long to say goodbye.

57:34.864 --> 57:37.600
Is that the new song?

57:37.666 --> 57:39.001
Yeah.

57:39.068 --> 57:40.970
You've finished it already?

57:41.037 --> 57:42.638
I think so.

57:45.941 --> 57:47.343
Well, good news.

57:47.410 --> 57:50.212
He says he's gonna have us back
on the road in the morning.

57:50.279 --> 57:52.214
Oh, and I asked about
your generator part too,

57:52.281 --> 57:55.251
but there's no way we
can get it in time.

57:55.317 --> 57:57.753
The phone work for you?

57:57.820 --> 57:58.287
Yeah.

58:05.361 --> 58:06.561
I have to go see her.

58:09.832 --> 58:11.333
OK.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.903
I mean, uh, we can stop by her
folk's place on the way back.

58:13.969 --> 58:14.804
She's taking the job.

58:18.441 --> 58:21.310
Her folk's house is not
too far off our route,

58:21.377 --> 58:30.319
so uh, I'm thinking
I've got to go see her.

58:30.386 --> 58:31.620
What are you guys talking about?

58:31.687 --> 58:33.889
You know, we have to
drive straight through now

58:33.956 --> 58:35.391
if we're gonna make it.

58:35.458 --> 58:37.793
You drop me at a bus station,
you guys can head on in the van

58:37.860 --> 58:38.294
and, uh--

58:38.360 --> 58:39.295
Wait.

58:39.361 --> 58:41.797
Are you quitting on us?

58:41.864 --> 58:42.998
No.

58:43.065 --> 58:43.766
I can catch a plane,
hopefully, and still

58:43.833 --> 58:44.333
make it there in time.

58:44.400 --> 58:45.601
Time out.

58:45.668 --> 58:48.204
Leaving aside the issue
of how we-- how you're

58:48.270 --> 58:50.306
going to pay for this, or
if the flight's delayed

58:50.372 --> 58:54.310
or whatever, I mean,
we have to rehearse.

58:54.376 --> 58:56.178
You've known about
this job for weeks.

58:56.245 --> 58:57.346
What changed here?

58:57.413 --> 58:59.081
I didn't think she
would take the job,

58:59.148 --> 59:00.816
but she flies out Monday.

59:00.883 --> 59:01.817
Oh, shit.

59:01.884 --> 59:02.751
London?

59:02.818 --> 59:03.953
Look.

59:04.019 --> 59:04.987
I don't want to let
anybody down, but--

59:05.054 --> 59:05.721
I'm beginning to
see what happened

59:05.788 --> 59:08.190
with this relationship.

59:08.257 --> 59:10.993
I mean, this poor girl flew all
the way to New York because,

59:11.060 --> 59:11.760
what?

59:11.827 --> 59:12.962
You went AWOL on her.

59:13.028 --> 59:14.163
And when I delivered
the news about the job,

59:14.230 --> 59:17.466
you didn't care enough
then to call her.

59:17.533 --> 59:19.969
So I'm having a hard time
understanding why suddenly now

59:20.035 --> 59:22.371
you want to run to her when
we're in the middle of this--

59:22.438 --> 59:24.807
Because I made a vow.

59:24.874 --> 59:25.407
I'm sorry.

59:25.474 --> 59:25.908
You made a what?

59:25.975 --> 59:29.345
A vow.

59:29.411 --> 59:30.279
No no no...

59:30.346 --> 59:32.715
You said she was
your girlfriend.

59:32.781 --> 59:38.087
No, you assumed that, and
I just didn't correct you.

59:43.826 --> 59:44.960
Hey, Rich?

59:46.228 --> 59:48.063
Rich?

59:48.130 --> 59:49.298
Now where the hell's he going?

1:00:09.351 --> 1:00:10.219
Ah!

1:00:10.286 --> 1:00:11.754
He's here.

1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:13.455
Listen-- let me rap with him a
minute, then I'll call you in.

1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:21.263
There you are.

1:00:21.330 --> 1:00:23.399
We've been looking
all over for you.

1:00:27.369 --> 1:00:29.138
Man, that is a tough gig.

1:00:29.205 --> 1:00:31.040
I've played worse.

1:00:31.106 --> 1:00:33.108
They don't look very
Mexican though, do they?

1:00:33.175 --> 1:00:35.444
No, they don't.

1:00:35.511 --> 1:00:37.913
They're good, though.

1:00:37.980 --> 1:00:39.248
Greg's outside.

1:00:39.315 --> 1:00:40.482
Dude, good news.

1:00:40.549 --> 1:00:42.518
The mechanic called his
buddy at the junkyard,

1:00:42.586 --> 1:00:43.552
found the generator part.

1:00:43.620 --> 1:00:46.488
They're giving it
to us for free.

1:00:46.555 --> 1:00:49.525
Do you really think you
should be doing that?

1:00:49.593 --> 1:00:52.094
Didn't you-- didn't
you quit drinking?

1:00:52.161 --> 1:00:53.429
I never started.

1:00:53.495 --> 1:00:54.496
I'm turning over a new leaf.

1:00:54.563 --> 1:00:56.398
In fact, the
stuff's pretty good.

1:00:56.465 --> 1:00:59.134
You should try some.

1:00:59.201 --> 1:01:03.505
Speak of the devil, Greg,
it that is his real name.

1:01:03.572 --> 1:01:05.374
Miss, can we have a
cup of coffee, please?

1:01:05.441 --> 1:01:07.142
Black, for my friend here.

1:01:09.646 --> 1:01:12.114
Guys, we should-- we
should have a band meeting.

1:01:12.181 --> 1:01:12.881
Band?

1:01:12.948 --> 1:01:14.350
Is that what this is?

1:01:14.416 --> 1:01:16.018
I've always wanted
to be in a band.

1:01:16.085 --> 1:01:18.254
Hey, Rich?

1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.923
You have every right
to be pissed at me.

1:01:20.990 --> 1:01:21.790
I'm sorry, man.

1:01:21.857 --> 1:01:24.260
I've been totally full of shit.

1:01:24.326 --> 1:01:25.595
And you're right.

1:01:25.662 --> 1:01:27.062
That's probably why my marriage
is fucked beyond repair

1:01:27.129 --> 1:01:30.199
and why I probably fucked
things up with my best friend

1:01:30.266 --> 1:01:32.368
now too--

1:01:32.434 --> 1:01:33.502
both my best friends.

1:01:36.305 --> 1:01:37.906
I'll be right back,
I have to pee.

1:01:37.973 --> 1:01:38.874
Rich, hold on.

1:01:38.941 --> 1:01:40.075
Hear him out.

1:01:40.142 --> 1:01:41.277
This is a shit soup
all the way around.

1:01:41.343 --> 1:01:43.613
I'm pissed at Greg
too, but that doesn't

1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:45.314
mean we can let him
blow his marriage

1:01:45.381 --> 1:01:47.216
to roll the dice with us in LA.

1:01:47.283 --> 1:01:49.084
He has to go.

1:01:49.151 --> 1:01:50.152
No, no, no.

1:01:50.219 --> 1:01:51.353
I don't want to
fuck things up for--

1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:51.820
You're not.
It's going to work out fine.

1:01:51.887 --> 1:01:53.022
Listen.

1:01:53.088 --> 1:01:55.457
I have an uncle, he
works for the airlines.

1:01:55.524 --> 1:01:55.958
We'll work something out.
We're going to make it work.

1:01:56.025 --> 1:01:57.192
Look.

1:01:57.259 --> 1:01:58.327
That's very cool, but
the truth of the matter

1:01:58.394 --> 1:02:00.764
is I have no idea
what I could even

1:02:00.829 --> 1:02:01.964
say to her at this point that's
going to change anything.

1:02:10.039 --> 1:02:13.008
You're not going
to say anything.

1:02:20.650 --> 1:02:22.585
Somebody
said something

1:02:22.652 --> 1:02:25.154
once I never will forget.

1:02:25.220 --> 1:02:30.025
He said, love is like a
blindfolded shot in the dark.

1:02:30.092 --> 1:02:34.296
Girl, when I met you I
was back to the wall.

1:02:34.363 --> 1:02:41.270
With one last round, and I shot
it straight from the heart.

1:02:41.337 --> 1:02:42.871
And I saw a spark.

1:02:45.541 --> 1:02:48.110
Yeah, I saw a spark.

1:02:52.749 --> 1:02:58.253
Somebody said something else
once I never will forget.

1:02:58.320 --> 1:02:59.455
I was just a boy.

1:02:59.521 --> 1:03:01.990
But it stayed with me.

1:03:02.057 --> 1:03:07.062
She said, if you got something
good, you got to hold on to it.

1:03:07.129 --> 1:03:11.333
So darling, won't you
please come and stay with me

1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:15.971
and be my spark.

1:03:16.038 --> 1:03:17.906
And be my spark.

1:03:22.010 --> 1:03:26.716
Because I've been waiting
so long for somebody,

1:03:26.783 --> 1:03:32.955
waiting for someone to melt
free this frozen heart.

1:03:33.021 --> 1:03:40.496
Darling, won't you please
be my silver spark?

1:03:40.562 --> 1:03:43.633
Oh, and burn in me.

1:03:48.537 --> 1:03:52.107
La, la, la, la, la, la...

1:04:09.558 --> 1:04:13.763
Now, I'm going to say something
I hope you never will forget.

1:04:13.830 --> 1:04:18.635
Wherever you are and
wherever I may be,

1:04:18.701 --> 1:04:23.740
as lost as I may seem,
as cold as it may get,

1:04:23.807 --> 1:04:29.344
as old as we may be, hope
you never will forget--

1:04:29.411 --> 1:04:32.014
that you are my spark.

1:04:34.751 --> 1:04:39.321
You are my spark.

1:04:39.388 --> 1:04:44.326
You are my spark.

1:04:44.393 --> 1:04:46.295
Yeah, you are.

1:04:49.699 --> 1:04:52.301
You are spark!

1:05:00.375 --> 1:05:05.280
Yeah, you are my spark.

1:05:05.347 --> 1:05:06.583
Yeah, you are.

1:05:06.649 --> 1:05:08.250
Nah, nah, nah.

1:05:19.629 --> 1:05:22.231
I don't think they fixed this.

1:05:22.297 --> 1:05:23.532
Let me see it.

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:25.567
Boarding
call, Cleveland Ohio, 220.

1:05:25.635 --> 1:05:27.469
Columbus, Ohio, 220.

1:05:27.536 --> 1:05:28.838
There you go.

1:05:28.905 --> 1:05:30.072
How do you have
all those degrees

1:05:30.138 --> 1:05:31.406
and not know how to
operate a flip phone?

1:05:31.473 --> 1:05:33.843
How is it that I'm in a
band with the only two dudes

1:05:33.910 --> 1:05:35.577
in America that don't
have cellphones?

1:05:35.645 --> 1:05:38.480
I communicate on a higher plane.

1:05:38.547 --> 1:05:39.481
All good, buddy?

1:05:39.548 --> 1:05:40.549
Yeah.

1:05:40.617 --> 1:05:41.885
Ticket to ride.

1:05:41.951 --> 1:05:44.654
There is no way she's gonna
to leave for London when

1:05:44.721 --> 1:05:45.855
she hears this tune.

1:05:45.922 --> 1:05:47.055
Thanks.

1:05:47.122 --> 1:05:49.525
Hey, give your uncle
my thanks too, huh.

1:05:49.592 --> 1:05:51.628
Uh, listen, guys.

1:05:51.694 --> 1:05:54.162
If for some reason
things don't--

1:05:54.229 --> 1:05:54.764
Hey, hey.

1:05:54.831 --> 1:05:56.565
Don't even, OK?

1:05:56.633 --> 1:05:57.566
Feel the wind?

1:05:57.634 --> 1:05:59.769
It's at our backs, OK?

1:05:59.836 --> 1:06:01.503
And the gods?

1:06:01.570 --> 1:06:03.673
Well, they're riding
shotgun, baby.

1:06:03.740 --> 1:06:06.508
I mean, how else do you
explain how we got this far?

1:06:06.575 --> 1:06:07.509
Good luck, buddy.

1:06:07.576 --> 1:06:09.411
It's a hell of a song.

1:06:09.478 --> 1:06:10.512
Thanks, man.

1:06:10.580 --> 1:06:11.748
Hey, look.

1:06:11.814 --> 1:06:13.348
I wrote down a number
where you can reach me.

1:06:13.415 --> 1:06:14.851
I'll be checking it, huh?

1:06:14.918 --> 1:06:20.155
And you guys be good to Bonnie
Blue, she'll be good to you.

1:06:20.222 --> 1:06:21.423
OK.

1:06:21.490 --> 1:06:21.557
This is
a final boarding call.

1:06:22.324 --> 1:06:22.992
Cleveland, Ohio, 220.

1:06:23.058 --> 1:06:27.529
Columbus, Ohio, 220.

1:06:27.597 --> 1:06:29.398
RGB.

1:06:29.464 --> 1:06:30.900
RGB.

1:06:30.967 --> 1:06:31.601
RGB.

1:06:31.668 --> 1:06:32.869
Check me out now.

1:06:32.936 --> 1:06:33.502
RGB.

1:06:33.569 --> 1:06:33.970
Come on, now.

1:06:34.037 --> 1:06:34.671
RGB.

1:06:34.737 --> 1:06:35.838
Check me out now.

1:06:35.905 --> 1:06:36.405
RGB.

1:06:40.442 --> 1:06:43.512
Oh,
California, here we come.

1:06:46.448 --> 1:06:51.386
Oh, California here we come.

1:06:51.453 --> 1:06:54.423
We got a couple of guitars,
old Bonnie on the run.

1:06:54.489 --> 1:06:59.428
Gonna open for the Melons,
going to get me some.

1:06:59.494 --> 1:07:03.298
I thought you hated the Melons?

1:07:03.365 --> 1:07:04.667
Yes, I do.

1:07:04.734 --> 1:07:10.740
They're all posers, but
they're gonna be our closers.

1:07:10.807 --> 1:07:12.842
We're playing before them.

1:07:12.909 --> 1:07:16.445
I don't think we're
opening for them.

1:07:16.511 --> 1:07:20.415
What's the difference?

1:07:20.482 --> 1:07:21.416
Have you heard from him?

1:07:21.483 --> 1:07:22.250
Who?

1:07:22.317 --> 1:07:22.852
Granny?
I don't know.

1:07:22.919 --> 1:07:23.753
Is it noon yet?

1:07:27.657 --> 1:07:31.226
Dude, it's dead.

1:07:37.265 --> 1:07:37.934
Hi.

1:07:38.001 --> 1:07:40.369
Mr. Granny, please?

1:07:40.435 --> 1:07:41.104
Hey, Granny.

1:07:41.169 --> 1:07:43.973
It's Brian from RGB.

1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:44.674
Sorry.

1:07:44.741 --> 1:07:45.708
Rich's phone died.

1:07:46.943 --> 1:07:49.311
Of course, we're halfway there.

1:07:50.580 --> 1:07:51.681
Yeah, what's up?

1:07:53.315 --> 1:07:53.983
Really?

1:07:54.050 --> 1:07:56.919
A full backing band?

1:07:56.986 --> 1:07:58.888
I mean, without a ton
of time to rehearse,

1:07:58.955 --> 1:08:01.824
should we focus on that the
harmonies and the songs?

1:08:03.726 --> 1:08:05.128
Actually, Greg isn't here.

1:08:05.193 --> 1:08:07.830
He's flying in, but we're all
going to meet at the club.

1:08:14.469 --> 1:08:15.170
Really?

1:08:18.841 --> 1:08:21.576
I mean-- I mean, I guess
I understand, but I--

1:08:25.748 --> 1:08:26.515
Yeah.

1:08:26.582 --> 1:08:28.885
Uh, just call Rich's cell.

1:08:35.792 --> 1:08:36.358
What?

1:08:36.425 --> 1:08:36.993
What's wrong?

1:08:37.060 --> 1:08:38.226
What'd he say?

1:08:38.293 --> 1:08:40.562
He wants us to play with
a whole backing band?

1:08:40.630 --> 1:08:41.798
Yeah.

1:08:41.864 --> 1:08:42.665
That doesn't make a lot
of sense if we're not

1:08:42.732 --> 1:08:44.600
going to have time to rehearse.

1:08:44.667 --> 1:08:46.803
And he wants us to dump Greg.

1:08:46.869 --> 1:08:49.271
What?

1:08:49.337 --> 1:08:51.974
He wants us to dump Greg.

1:08:52.041 --> 1:08:53.076
What are you talking about?

1:08:53.142 --> 1:08:54.409
Granny said that
he's holding us back.

1:08:54.476 --> 1:08:57.479
And if it was just "R&B",
he'd feel a lot better

1:08:57.546 --> 1:09:00.016
about working with us.

1:09:00.083 --> 1:09:02.952
He said no one's doing
three-part harmony.

1:09:03.019 --> 1:09:04.587
That's what makes us special?

1:09:04.654 --> 1:09:05.454
Yeah.

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:06.055
Yeah.

1:09:06.122 --> 1:09:06.622
I know.

1:09:14.529 --> 1:09:15.464
Where we going, dude?

1:09:18.134 --> 1:09:21.570
So he said the showcase is
off, if we don't, what--

1:09:21.637 --> 1:09:22.304
fire Greg?

1:09:22.370 --> 1:09:23.039
Well, I don't know.

1:09:23.106 --> 1:09:24.974
He had to jump off.

1:09:25.041 --> 1:09:27.643
But as far as you
know, he said that.

1:09:27.710 --> 1:09:28.577
Yeah.

1:09:29.679 --> 1:09:34.984
Who the hell-- now
the thing works.

1:09:35.051 --> 1:09:36.586
Will you answer this?

1:09:39.889 --> 1:09:40.957
Answer before the--

1:09:41.023 --> 1:09:42.625
Dude, what if it's Greg?

1:10:04.914 --> 1:10:06.783
Rich?

1:10:06.849 --> 1:10:08.751
Hey, man.

1:10:08.818 --> 1:10:10.620
Rich?

1:10:10.686 --> 1:10:12.487
Rich?

1:10:12.554 --> 1:10:13.421
What the fuck?

1:10:13.488 --> 1:10:15.625
Rich?

1:10:15.691 --> 1:10:16.391
Come on, man.

1:10:16.458 --> 1:10:17.292
Where are you going?!

1:10:19.962 --> 1:10:22.564
Dude?

1:10:22.632 --> 1:10:24.867
Rich?

1:10:24.934 --> 1:10:26.836
Hey, man?

1:10:26.903 --> 1:10:27.770
You OK?

1:10:27.837 --> 1:10:28.805
Fuck!

1:10:28.871 --> 1:10:29.705
Fuckity-fuck.

1:10:29.772 --> 1:10:30.807
Fucking shit!

1:10:30.873 --> 1:10:31.707
Fucking balls!

1:10:31.774 --> 1:10:33.910
Fuck!

1:10:33.976 --> 1:10:34.644
Fuck!

1:10:41.050 --> 1:10:44.086
I was a month away
from graduating.

1:10:44.153 --> 1:10:47.489
You know, man, maybe they'll
let you finish next semester.

1:10:47.556 --> 1:10:48.658
No.

1:10:48.724 --> 1:10:50.993
I mic dropped my
dissertation at his feet.

1:10:51.060 --> 1:10:53.162
He's not inviting me back.

1:10:53.229 --> 1:10:53.729
Yeah.

1:10:56.866 --> 1:10:57.566
A sign, huh?

1:11:00.468 --> 1:11:01.704
What?

1:11:01.771 --> 1:11:05.775
That we were all supposed
to find each other?

1:11:05.842 --> 1:11:07.442
That Granny was
supposed to find us?

1:11:11.479 --> 1:11:14.951
You seem to have a
hot line to the--

1:11:15.017 --> 1:11:17.119
whatever it is up there.

1:11:17.186 --> 1:11:20.156
Out here, the signal must
be four or five bars.

1:11:20.223 --> 1:11:22.992
What's he trying to tell us now?

1:11:23.059 --> 1:11:25.027
Dude, we shouldn't be out here.

1:11:25.094 --> 1:11:25.962
True that, my friend.

1:11:26.028 --> 1:11:27.063
True that.

1:11:27.129 --> 1:11:30.099
What's the definition
of insanity?

1:11:30.166 --> 1:11:32.068
How can someone study
their whole lives

1:11:32.134 --> 1:11:35.671
and still have no fucking clue?

1:11:35.738 --> 1:11:39.609
Dude, you're scaring me.

1:11:39.675 --> 1:11:40.442
I'm scaring you?

1:11:40.508 --> 1:11:43.112
Oh, that's rich.

1:11:43.179 --> 1:11:44.313
Yeah.
Look around.

1:11:44.379 --> 1:11:45.480
We're in the middle
of a fucking field.

1:11:45.547 --> 1:11:46.616
You're swearing like
a fucking sailor.

1:11:46.682 --> 1:11:49.051
I never even heard
you swear before.

1:11:49.118 --> 1:11:50.319
That's because I
fucking hate swearing.

1:11:50.385 --> 1:11:54.023
It's dead fucking weight,
dragging you down.

1:11:54.090 --> 1:11:57.760
When the right word, the
right combination of words--

1:11:57.827 --> 1:11:58.493
I don't know.

1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:02.164
Maybe you can-- fly.

1:12:05.001 --> 1:12:06.168
But you know what?

1:12:06.235 --> 1:12:07.336
Swearing feels good.

1:12:07.402 --> 1:12:11.741
If feels
really fucking ass good.

1:12:11.807 --> 1:12:13.075
Fuck!

1:12:13.142 --> 1:12:15.745
Fuck you.

1:12:15.811 --> 1:12:16.746
Fuck you!

1:12:16.812 --> 1:12:17.680
All right.
Come on.

1:12:17.747 --> 1:12:18.314
Let's get out.
Fuck you!

1:12:18.381 --> 1:12:18.881
No, fuck you!

1:12:18.948 --> 1:12:19.447
Fuck you!

1:12:19.514 --> 1:12:20.783
Fuck you!

1:12:20.850 --> 1:12:22.251
They're just kids, but
they're probably packing.

1:12:22.318 --> 1:12:22.818
Come on.

1:12:22.885 --> 1:12:23.386
Fuck you!

1:12:23.451 --> 1:12:23.518
Fuck you!

1:12:28.190 --> 1:12:31.761
What do I say again?

1:12:31.827 --> 1:12:35.097
Dude, the phone's gonna die.

1:12:35.164 --> 1:12:37.767
Just tell him the truth.

1:12:42.138 --> 1:12:44.607
The person you're trying
to reach is not available.

1:12:44.674 --> 1:12:46.776
Please leave a message
after the tone.

1:12:49.145 --> 1:12:51.080
Greg, it's Rich and Brian.

1:12:51.147 --> 1:12:52.315
Hey, uh, look.

1:12:52.381 --> 1:12:55.885
Something's changed, uh,
about the California--

1:12:55.952 --> 1:12:56.752
about the showcase.

1:12:56.819 --> 1:13:00.189
Um, Granny called and said--

1:13:04.060 --> 1:13:06.796
it's canceled.

1:13:06.862 --> 1:13:07.997
Uh, I know.

1:13:08.064 --> 1:13:08.764
Fucking sucks.

1:13:10.933 --> 1:13:13.535
But at least now you don't have
to race to catch that plane.

1:13:13.602 --> 1:13:16.806
And you can stay there for now.

1:13:16.872 --> 1:13:17.940
We're going through a tunnel.

1:13:18.007 --> 1:13:19.175
Uh, sorry.

1:13:19.241 --> 1:13:19.875
I hope everything's
going well with Kelly.

1:13:19.942 --> 1:13:21.509
Brian says Hi too.

1:13:41.163 --> 1:13:45.768
There's a fire
on the London Bridge.

1:13:49.171 --> 1:13:52.507
Smoke black like the
night rose higher.

1:13:55.644 --> 1:14:02.084
And there's a hole
in up through which,

1:14:02.151 --> 1:14:03.819
red flames like
cathedral spires.

1:14:08.424 --> 1:14:09.925
Red flames like
cathedral spires.

1:14:21.070 --> 1:14:24.640
Now the crossbeam's
split in two.

1:14:28.044 --> 1:14:31.947
Bails of water to
buy some time...

1:14:43.993 --> 1:14:45.961
Brian, is that you?

1:14:46.028 --> 1:14:48.364
Good morning, Sleeping Beauty.

1:14:48.431 --> 1:14:50.966
You gotta come see this.

1:15:06.715 --> 1:15:11.954
Hey, Sleeping Beauty,
you gotta come see this.

1:15:46.889 --> 1:15:48.791
Hey.

1:15:48.858 --> 1:15:49.758
You OK?

1:16:03.439 --> 1:16:05.708
It's crazy, isn't it?

1:16:10.079 --> 1:16:15.151
The haze-- pollution right?

1:16:15.217 --> 1:16:16.785
Fucking beautiful.

1:16:19.421 --> 1:16:23.325
Rich, do you think writing
and singing songs matters?

1:16:28.397 --> 1:16:31.167
My mom doesn't.

1:16:31.233 --> 1:16:33.002
My dad definitely didn't.

1:16:33.068 --> 1:16:36.138
He wanted me to be a doctor.

1:16:36.205 --> 1:16:39.875
The irony is he was a writer.

1:16:39.942 --> 1:16:42.044
Mine too.

1:16:42.111 --> 1:16:44.146
I thought he was
in the military.

1:16:44.213 --> 1:16:46.048
He was until I was 12.

1:16:46.115 --> 1:16:48.384
Then he became a cop.

1:16:48.450 --> 1:16:54.123
But I mean, he hated
me being a musician.

1:16:54.190 --> 1:16:57.927
I was on my way to his memorial
when you guys picked me up

1:16:57.993 --> 1:17:00.029
in the van.

1:17:00.095 --> 1:17:03.766
I didn't make it, obviously.

1:17:03.832 --> 1:17:05.734
He would've preferred
it that way anyway.

1:17:08.370 --> 1:17:09.071
We shouldn't do this.

1:17:09.138 --> 1:17:10.573
It doesn't feel right.

1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:13.142
Well, what I was going to say
is I was going to take off,

1:17:13.209 --> 1:17:15.244
I was going to split.

1:17:15.311 --> 1:17:16.912
Then I had this thought.

1:17:16.979 --> 1:17:19.081
How many people down
there you think?

1:17:19.148 --> 1:17:20.416
LA?

1:17:20.482 --> 1:17:21.350
I don't know.

1:17:21.417 --> 1:17:22.151
Millions.

1:17:22.218 --> 1:17:23.552
Right.

1:17:23.620 --> 1:17:25.921
And there are thousands of
dudes down there that play

1:17:25.988 --> 1:17:27.189
guitar better than me.

1:17:27.256 --> 1:17:28.324
They write better songs.

1:17:28.390 --> 1:17:29.558
They sing better than I do.

1:17:29.626 --> 1:17:33.996
Everything that I can
do, they do better.

1:17:34.063 --> 1:17:36.565
I also know that if I sit
up here thinking about that.

1:17:36.633 --> 1:17:39.034
Or what my dad
would want me to do.

1:17:39.101 --> 1:17:40.569
Or you know what--

1:17:40.637 --> 1:17:43.205
maybe I'm too old for this shit,
or any shit other than the one

1:17:43.272 --> 1:17:44.608
thing I give a shit about.

1:17:44.674 --> 1:17:47.109
Then I'll just wither away
having never accomplished

1:17:47.176 --> 1:17:50.412
anything I can be proud of.

1:17:50.479 --> 1:17:56.852
Which is why, at
exactly 1800 hours

1:17:56.919 --> 1:18:02.825
tonight, we will unsheathe our
instruments of righteousness

1:18:02.891 --> 1:18:05.261
and we will engage the
unholy hellions that

1:18:05.327 --> 1:18:07.830
hold this city in their thrall.

1:18:07.896 --> 1:18:10.032
And we will blaze
a trail to glory,

1:18:10.099 --> 1:18:18.140
or be eviscerated in the
fetid digestive slime of the--

1:18:18.207 --> 1:18:19.908
eviscerated?

1:18:19.975 --> 1:18:21.110
Macerated maybe?

1:18:21.176 --> 1:18:22.278
Mas-- macerated?

1:18:22.344 --> 1:18:23.846
Hey, guys?

1:18:23.912 --> 1:18:26.448
Guys, you gotta see this.

1:18:26.515 --> 1:18:27.883
Hey, guys.

1:18:27.950 --> 1:18:29.218
Hey, guys, you gotta see this.

1:18:29.285 --> 1:18:29.785
Guys.

1:18:29.852 --> 1:18:31.020
Hey, guys.

1:18:31.086 --> 1:18:32.988
You gotta see this.

1:18:33.055 --> 1:18:36.392
You gotta see this.

1:18:36.458 --> 1:18:37.493
Whoa.

1:18:37.559 --> 1:18:39.061
Welcome to LA brother.

1:18:39.128 --> 1:18:39.763
Look at it, man.

1:18:39.828 --> 1:18:40.329
Yeah, we're good.

1:18:40.396 --> 1:18:41.030
Thank you.

1:18:41.096 --> 1:18:41.631
Thank you so much.

1:18:42.298 --> 1:18:42.798
Have a good day.

1:18:42.865 --> 1:18:44.266
Thank you.

1:18:44.333 --> 1:18:44.734
Yes.

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:45.234
OK.

1:18:45.301 --> 1:18:45.702
Yeah.

1:18:45.769 --> 1:18:47.102
OK.

1:18:47.169 --> 1:18:49.071
You're welcome, man!

1:18:49.138 --> 1:18:50.072
Wow.

1:18:50.139 --> 1:18:51.507
How long was I out?

1:18:55.377 --> 1:18:56.478
Not too long.

1:18:56.545 --> 1:18:58.480
I figured you needed
your beauty rest.

1:19:02.585 --> 1:19:04.953
But now that you're up, we
should probably rehearse.

1:19:05.020 --> 1:19:08.424
It's three hours to
showtime, brother!

1:19:13.962 --> 1:19:16.398
And as the
sun dips to the sea.

1:19:16.465 --> 1:19:18.067
L.A. baby!

1:19:18.133 --> 1:19:19.902
Woo!

1:19:19.968 --> 1:19:24.273
I think of those
who could not be with me.

1:19:28.110 --> 1:19:32.615
But I got miles of
blue sky above me.

1:19:36.518 --> 1:19:40.356
And a blanket of
sunshine to cover me.

1:19:40.422 --> 1:19:44.026
No one can take this away.

1:19:47.664 --> 1:19:52.334
I thank my lucky
stars every day.

1:19:52.401 --> 1:19:53.502
Every day.

1:19:53.569 --> 1:19:55.204
Every day--

1:19:55.270 --> 1:19:57.339
Does that sound weird
without the third part?

1:19:57.406 --> 1:19:59.074
No, I don't think so.

1:19:59.141 --> 1:19:59.776
Whoa.

1:19:59.843 --> 1:20:00.476
Did you see that?

1:20:00.542 --> 1:20:03.245
That was Dr. Phil!

1:20:03.312 --> 1:20:05.080
My mom loves Dr. Phil.

1:20:05.147 --> 1:20:16.158
I found what
I'm looking for, oh, oh.

1:20:23.465 --> 1:20:26.268
Maybe there's another
"Bob's Crepery"?

1:20:26.335 --> 1:20:28.203
This is the address.

1:20:33.509 --> 1:20:35.745
Hey, Rich?

1:20:35.812 --> 1:20:36.311
Rich?

1:20:49.291 --> 1:20:52.494
Who rang that fucking bell!?

1:20:52.561 --> 1:20:54.062
Ah!

1:20:54.129 --> 1:20:55.364
I'm coming!

1:20:55.431 --> 1:20:56.064
I'm coming!

1:20:59.134 --> 1:21:03.172
Uh-- life must be
tough for you guys.

1:21:03.238 --> 1:21:04.373
I'm sorry?

1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:05.974
You can't read?

1:21:08.611 --> 1:21:09.244
Oh, sorry.

1:21:09.311 --> 1:21:09.978
I didn't see that.

1:21:10.045 --> 1:21:12.347
The bell actually works?

1:21:12.414 --> 1:21:13.482
Unfortunately, yes.

1:21:13.549 --> 1:21:14.684
It does.

1:21:14.751 --> 1:21:16.452
And the kids in this
fucking neighborhood

1:21:16.518 --> 1:21:18.554
apparently got
nothing better to do

1:21:18.621 --> 1:21:20.723
than play "ding dong
ditch" Now, I got

1:21:20.790 --> 1:21:22.759
two guys waiting on the phone.

1:21:22.826 --> 1:21:24.059
How can I help you?

1:21:24.126 --> 1:21:25.194
Oh, sorry.

1:21:25.260 --> 1:21:26.328
We're actually
playing here tonight.

1:21:26.395 --> 1:21:27.029
We're supposed to
find the manager.

1:21:27.095 --> 1:21:27.897
Sorry, we're late.

1:21:27.963 --> 1:21:31.433
Oh, no-- You're a bit early.

1:21:31.500 --> 1:21:32.568
Club doesn't open til 5:00.

1:21:32.635 --> 1:21:33.268
--Hey, man.

1:21:33.335 --> 1:21:36.104
Yeah, I'm coming!

1:21:36.171 --> 1:21:37.807
Well, what time's sound check?

1:21:37.874 --> 1:21:40.275
You'll get a line
check, no sound check.

1:21:40.342 --> 1:21:40.844
--Hey, man.

1:21:40.910 --> 1:21:41.443
The phone!

1:21:41.510 --> 1:21:42.645
Yes, I'm coming!

1:21:42.712 --> 1:21:45.080
Jesus Christ!

1:21:45.147 --> 1:21:50.085
sorry-- what band are you guys?

1:21:50.152 --> 1:21:52.154
We're RGB.

1:21:52.221 --> 1:21:53.690
Oh.

1:21:53.756 --> 1:21:56.693
Well, why didn't you say so?

1:21:56.759 --> 1:22:03.332
That-- that is a whore of
an entirely different color.

1:22:03.398 --> 1:22:04.734
Yeah.

1:22:04.801 --> 1:22:05.334
Well, you know...

1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:06.101
It's funny.

1:22:06.168 --> 1:22:07.737
I was-- I don't know.

1:22:07.804 --> 1:22:10.607
You guys, I was expecting, um--

1:22:10.673 --> 1:22:13.342
well, you're a bit
older, you know?

1:22:13.408 --> 1:22:15.077
But I loved the demo.

1:22:15.143 --> 1:22:17.446
Three-part harmony, I mean--

1:22:17.513 --> 1:22:19.281
who does that anymore?

1:22:19.348 --> 1:22:19.816
Thanks.

1:22:19.883 --> 1:22:20.549
Thanks.

1:22:20.617 --> 1:22:22.852
Actually, we're R&B now.

1:22:22.919 --> 1:22:25.153
We should probably change that.

1:22:26.589 --> 1:22:29.091
You lost a G, huh?

1:22:29.157 --> 1:22:29.826
That blows.

1:22:29.893 --> 1:22:34.196
What happened there?

1:22:34.263 --> 1:22:36.231
Edwardo?

1:22:36.298 --> 1:22:37.800
Oh, for the fuck's sake!

1:22:37.867 --> 1:22:40.703
Load in is 15 minutes
before your set, OK?

1:22:40.770 --> 1:22:42.204
I gotta go.

1:22:42.271 --> 1:22:45.842
Do you have any recommendations
on where we could find some--

1:22:45.909 --> 1:22:47.342
food?

1:22:57.620 --> 1:22:58.955
Guys, don't worry.

1:22:59.022 --> 1:23:00.522
Two-part harmony, three-part,
what's the difference?

1:23:00.590 --> 1:23:01.390
It's harmony.

1:23:01.456 --> 1:23:02.825
Yeah, but--

1:23:02.892 --> 1:23:03.693
Listen, you guys felt that
you were stronger as a duo--

1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:04.560
We felt we were stronger?--

1:23:04.627 --> 1:23:06.395
And you made the tough call.

1:23:06.461 --> 1:23:07.730
But you know what?

1:23:07.797 --> 1:23:08.831
You made the right call.
I gotta tell you something.

1:23:08.898 --> 1:23:09.999
The streets of
this town are paved

1:23:10.065 --> 1:23:12.167
with the corpses of
should-have-beens

1:23:12.234 --> 1:23:13.569
who just couldn't
stomach the tough calls.

1:23:13.636 --> 1:23:14.637
But you two?

1:23:14.704 --> 1:23:16.104
You're the stars
of this band, OK?

1:23:16.171 --> 1:23:20.275
And R&B-- I mean, come on, what
a great name for a folk duo.

1:23:20.342 --> 1:23:20.877
Huh?

1:23:20.944 --> 1:23:21.611
Am I right?

1:23:21.678 --> 1:23:22.745
Rich?

1:23:22.812 --> 1:23:24.246
What about the backing band?

1:23:24.313 --> 1:23:27.182
We were hoping to sound check
or run the tunes at least--

1:23:27.249 --> 1:23:27.917
Hey, boys.

1:23:27.984 --> 1:23:30.218
The worrying is my job.

1:23:30.285 --> 1:23:32.154
You guys do like
Jackson Browne--

1:23:32.220 --> 1:23:34.556
"Take it easy" My
boys will be there

1:23:34.624 --> 1:23:36.191
with 5:45, locked and loaded.

1:23:36.258 --> 1:23:38.828
You guys do what you do so well.

1:23:38.895 --> 1:23:40.763
I'll schmooze the
record cats, OK?

1:23:40.830 --> 1:23:42.531
Then we'll all meet
backstage and we'll

1:23:42.599 --> 1:23:46.168
raise a glass, all right?

1:23:46.234 --> 1:23:46.970
Rich?

1:23:47.036 --> 1:23:47.870
Rich?
Come on--

1:23:47.937 --> 1:23:48.605
Yeah.
That's fine--

1:23:48.671 --> 1:23:49.304
Is your phone acting up?

1:23:49.371 --> 1:23:50.773
I can't hear you.

1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:51.373
Right on!

1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:53.175
We said OK.

1:23:53.241 --> 1:23:53.710
Great!

1:23:53.776 --> 1:23:54.844
Great!

1:23:54.911 --> 1:23:57.446
Like Hamlet said--
veni, vidi, vici!

1:23:57.512 --> 1:23:59.348
Now, go get em, guys!

1:23:59.414 --> 1:24:00.315
--Hold that call.

1:24:00.382 --> 1:24:00.917
Stop.

1:24:00.984 --> 1:24:01.516
Hold that call!

1:24:04.921 --> 1:24:06.455
Let's do this.

1:24:06.521 --> 1:24:08.357
OK.

1:24:12.762 --> 1:24:14.296
You see Granny out there?

1:24:14.363 --> 1:24:14.897
It's too crowded.

1:24:14.964 --> 1:24:16.099
--Heads up.

1:24:16.164 --> 1:24:18.266
There is a dressing
room, but we only get it

1:24:18.333 --> 1:24:19.869
for 45 minutes after the set.

1:24:19.936 --> 1:24:21.671
That's gotta be where
he's gonna meet us.

1:24:21.738 --> 1:24:22.805
Where's our band?!

1:24:22.872 --> 1:24:23.973
--Last song.

1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:26.541
Start moving your
stuff toward the stage.

1:24:26.609 --> 1:24:27.242
Shit!

1:24:27.309 --> 1:24:27.710
--Coming through.

1:24:27.777 --> 1:24:29.177
Listen.

1:24:29.244 --> 1:24:30.913
You try calling Granny, I'll
get the stuff to the stage.

1:24:34.549 --> 1:24:36.218
Hey, Bri!

1:24:36.284 --> 1:24:36.853
Oh, guys.

1:24:36.919 --> 1:24:37.687
I'm so sorry.

1:24:37.754 --> 1:24:40.455
My plane was way delayed.

1:24:40.522 --> 1:24:41.057
Greg.

1:24:41.124 --> 1:24:41.658
You're here?

1:24:41.724 --> 1:24:43.291
Rich, it's Greg.

1:24:43.358 --> 1:24:44.359
Shit.

1:24:44.426 --> 1:24:45.460
You're probably
trying to reach me.

1:24:45.527 --> 1:24:46.963
I knew when I couldn't
reach you and I

1:24:47.030 --> 1:24:49.231
didn't hear from you that your
phone was probably still messed

1:24:49.297 --> 1:24:50.099
up--

1:24:50.165 --> 1:24:51.333
Wait-- you didn't hear from us?

1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:51.968
No.

1:24:52.035 --> 1:24:52.534
--Never?

1:24:52.602 --> 1:24:54.671
--Nothing?

1:24:54.737 --> 1:24:56.304
But I'm here.

1:24:56.371 --> 1:24:57.774
I'm in time?

1:24:57.840 --> 1:24:58.407
Yeah.

1:24:58.473 --> 1:24:58.908
Come on then!

1:24:58.975 --> 1:25:00.843
Yeah.

1:25:00.910 --> 1:25:02.679
I'm so relieved.

1:25:02.745 --> 1:25:03.746
Luckily, I reached Granny.

1:25:03.813 --> 1:25:05.247
He told me the address.

1:25:05.313 --> 1:25:05.982
He did?!

1:25:06.049 --> 1:25:07.050
Guys, they're done.

1:25:07.116 --> 1:25:09.752
I need you on stage
setting up now!

1:25:09.819 --> 1:25:10.620
Where are my keys?

1:25:10.687 --> 1:25:11.888
--The van's right out back.

1:25:11.954 --> 1:25:13.890
I'll take you there.

1:25:13.956 --> 1:25:14.624
Be right there!

1:25:27.003 --> 1:25:27.970
Where's the drummer?

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:32.942
We don't need him.

1:25:33.009 --> 1:25:34.242
Hey, G, how did it go?

1:25:37.579 --> 1:25:39.649
I'm sorry, man.

1:25:39.716 --> 1:25:43.586
Well, I'm just really glad to
be with you guys at this point.

1:25:43.653 --> 1:25:44.787
Me too.

1:25:44.854 --> 1:25:47.590
Me too, buddy.

1:25:47.657 --> 1:25:48.323
Let's do this.

1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:51.293
All right.

1:25:51.359 --> 1:25:51.961
This is it.

1:25:54.931 --> 1:25:56.899
So much for Granny's band.

1:25:56.966 --> 1:25:57.532
--What band?

1:25:57.600 --> 1:25:58.134
You know what?

1:25:58.201 --> 1:25:59.568
Forget the band.

1:25:59.635 --> 1:26:01.637
This is RGB.

1:26:01.704 --> 1:26:02.672
--Hey, guys.

1:26:02.739 --> 1:26:03.405
Sorry I'm late.

1:26:03.472 --> 1:26:04.707
I'm Tommy, the drummer.

1:26:04.774 --> 1:26:06.676
Studio session ran late.

1:26:06.743 --> 1:26:07.977
--No sweat.

1:26:08.044 --> 1:26:08.745
But I think at this point,
it's too late for any--

1:26:08.811 --> 1:26:09.779
Don't worry about us.

1:26:09.846 --> 1:26:11.546
We'll be set in
about 60 seconds.

1:26:14.684 --> 1:26:15.383
OK.

1:26:15.450 --> 1:26:16.551
Wow.

1:26:16.619 --> 1:26:18.621
--I mean, do they
even know the tunes?

1:26:18.688 --> 1:26:19.655
Totally good to go, guys.

1:26:19.722 --> 1:26:20.857
Just do your thing.

1:26:20.923 --> 1:26:21.791
Love the tunes, guys.

1:26:21.858 --> 1:26:22.692
--Yeah.

1:26:22.759 --> 1:26:23.458
--Really great.

1:26:23.525 --> 1:26:24.727
Thanks.

1:26:24.794 --> 1:26:26.428
Thank you.

1:26:26.495 --> 1:26:30.365
Looks like it's all
coming together.

1:26:30.432 --> 1:26:31.500
All right then.

1:26:31.566 --> 1:26:34.737
OK, put your hands
together for RGB.

1:26:44.513 --> 1:26:46.082
OK, the first song
we're going to play is--

1:26:46.149 --> 1:26:48.383
--Already copied your set list.

1:26:48.450 --> 1:26:49.152
Ah, Great.

1:26:49.218 --> 1:26:49.886
The drums come in at--

1:26:49.952 --> 1:26:51.821
Bar 9, tempo 65 bpm.

1:26:51.888 --> 1:26:53.055
Guys, just do your thing.

1:26:53.122 --> 1:26:54.356
We got your back.

1:26:54.422 --> 1:26:57.126
Literally.

1:26:57.193 --> 1:26:57.593
Ah...

1:26:57.660 --> 1:26:58.426
OK.

1:27:03.699 --> 1:27:07.603
This old house
is cracked and worn.

1:27:07.670 --> 1:27:11.808
The walls are faded
and the curtains torn.

1:27:11.874 --> 1:27:13.843
Sometimes it feels
like we're running just

1:27:13.910 --> 1:27:18.047
to keep falling behind.

1:27:18.114 --> 1:27:21.050
The day is done.

1:27:21.117 --> 1:27:22.718
Won't you come?

1:27:22.785 --> 1:27:26.022
Leave the dishes,
turn the TV off.

1:27:26.088 --> 1:27:28.991
I built a fire.

1:27:29.058 --> 1:27:32.494
Oh, and the fire is warm...

1:27:32.561 --> 1:27:39.467
Don't know where but I
hear the beat of a drum.

1:27:39.534 --> 1:27:47.877
Somewhere I swear I hear
the strains of a song.

1:27:47.944 --> 1:27:52.682
Dance with me to this song.

1:27:52.748 --> 1:27:56.819
Dance now darling, let
your hair run down.

1:27:56.886 --> 1:28:02.124
Dance with me all night long.

1:28:04.492 --> 1:28:04.760
Thank you.

1:28:09.131 --> 1:28:11.634
Well, anyway.

1:28:11.701 --> 1:28:12.869
We are RGB.

1:28:12.935 --> 1:28:14.971
And thanks, thanks for coming.

1:28:15.037 --> 1:28:18.040
And this next tune
we want to play,

1:28:18.107 --> 1:28:22.678
is a song called "Crumble".

1:28:33.055 --> 1:28:36.993
It's late.

1:28:37.059 --> 1:28:39.527
So tired.

1:28:39.595 --> 1:28:40.296
You called.

1:28:40.363 --> 1:28:40.830
And stumbled inside...

1:28:50.740 --> 1:28:52.642
Let's hear
it for the Melons!

1:29:14.730 --> 1:29:15.898
Je suis rock and roll!

1:29:15.965 --> 1:29:17.532
--Yeah.

1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:18.968
That was fucking awesome, bro.

1:29:19.035 --> 1:29:20.403
--Hell, yeah.

1:29:20.468 --> 1:29:21.604
I think those chicks in the
front row were digging it.

1:29:21.671 --> 1:29:22.305
--Your solo tonight
in Revolution was

1:29:22.371 --> 1:29:23.940
--Nice set, guys.

1:29:24.006 --> 1:29:24.539
--Awesome

1:29:24.607 --> 1:29:25.274
--Good job!

1:29:25.341 --> 1:29:26.175
Nuke,

1:29:26.242 --> 1:29:26.943
You killed 'em!

1:29:27.009 --> 1:29:28.177
--How'd you like that?

1:29:28.244 --> 1:29:30.780
--Hey, I want you to
meet the club manager.

1:29:30.846 --> 1:29:31.513
Steve?

1:29:31.579 --> 1:29:32.248
Steve?

1:29:32.315 --> 1:29:33.082
--Guys, great show.

1:29:33.149 --> 1:29:33.849
This is Nuke-- and Lefty.

1:29:33.916 --> 1:29:35.318
How you doing, Steve?

1:29:35.384 --> 1:29:37.386
--I've got to get you back,
do another show, all right?

1:29:37.452 --> 1:29:37.853
Oh, thanks a lot.
We'd love to.

1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:38.587
--Yeah.

1:29:38.654 --> 1:29:39.922
Thanks a lot, Steve.

1:29:39.989 --> 1:29:41.257
Look.

1:29:41.324 --> 1:29:42.792
A lot of people from the
label want to meet you guys.

1:29:42.858 --> 1:29:43.659
So, you ready?

1:29:43.726 --> 1:29:44.293
--Yeah.

1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:44.894
Let's do this!

1:29:44.961 --> 1:29:45.594
--Am I ever?

1:29:45.661 --> 1:29:46.162
Come on, let's go!

1:29:46.228 --> 1:29:46.729
All right.

1:29:46.796 --> 1:29:47.630
Let's go.

1:29:47.697 --> 1:29:49.632
Just gotta get my guitar case.

1:29:49.699 --> 1:29:50.366
--Oh, hey man.

1:29:50.433 --> 1:29:51.968
I just need my case?

1:29:52.034 --> 1:29:52.702
All right...

1:30:03.145 --> 1:30:06.548
I guess Granny's
not coming back...

1:30:06.615 --> 1:30:08.483
We're supposed to be
out of here by now.

1:30:11.220 --> 1:30:13.255
We're supposed to be out
of here by now, Rich.

1:30:30.072 --> 1:30:33.843
...I can get you guys in front
of some cats that could take

1:30:33.909 --> 1:30:37.079
this shit to Neptune.

1:30:37.146 --> 1:30:41.617
Honestly, I love
what you're doing!

1:30:41.684 --> 1:30:42.385
--Yeah.

1:30:42.451 --> 1:30:43.119
Yeah, that's terrific.

1:30:43.185 --> 1:30:44.653
You guys are beautiful!

1:30:47.857 --> 1:30:51.160
Hey, Rich...?

1:30:51.227 --> 1:30:52.895
--Rich, you left your bag?

1:30:52.962 --> 1:30:55.297
Rich, where you going?

1:30:55.364 --> 1:30:56.365
Where's he going?

1:30:56.432 --> 1:30:57.066
Come on.

1:30:57.133 --> 1:30:58.601
I'll get his bag.

1:31:36.172 --> 1:31:41.410
I've been
coming from far away...

1:31:41.477 --> 1:31:46.916
miles from anywhere,
another day.

1:31:46.982 --> 1:31:52.721
That I rest my mind singing
songs with the old ones.

1:31:58.127 --> 1:32:00.329
So hold me up.

1:32:00.396 --> 1:32:02.331
Come on, hold me up.

1:32:02.398 --> 1:32:03.999
Can't you hear me calling?

1:32:09.071 --> 1:32:12.308
The way the clouds move.

1:32:12.374 --> 1:32:14.977
Here they come,
they're big and black.

1:32:20.382 --> 1:32:25.821
And that's the sound of a
man who's working on his way

1:32:25.888 --> 1:32:26.322
back...

1:32:41.537 --> 1:32:47.443
I've been coming from far away.

1:32:47.510 --> 1:32:51.981
I'm miles from
anywhere, another day.

1:32:52.047 --> 1:32:58.087
That I rest my mind singing
songs with the old ones.

1:33:02.191 --> 1:33:04.093
Now, she comes to me.

1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:06.095
--Now she comes to me.

1:33:06.162 --> 1:33:06.996
She comes to me.

1:33:07.062 --> 1:33:09.064
Yeah, she comes to me at last.

1:33:13.469 --> 1:33:15.271
Now, she comes to me.

1:33:15.337 --> 1:33:16.405
--Now she comes to me.

1:33:16.472 --> 1:33:18.307
Yeah, she comes to me.

1:33:18.374 --> 1:33:19.975
She comes to me at last...

1:33:58.615 --> 1:34:02.218
I was waiting, I was waiting--

1:34:02.284 --> 1:34:04.520
like an empty glass.

1:34:04.588 --> 1:34:06.889
--Like an empty glass.

1:34:06.956 --> 1:34:08.190
--Whoa.

1:34:08.257 --> 1:34:09.525
--Whoa.

1:34:09.593 --> 1:34:17.199
I was waiting, I was
waiting like an empty glass.

1:34:17.266 --> 1:34:18.467
--I was waiting...
