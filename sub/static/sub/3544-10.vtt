00:02.160 --> 00:03.889
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.040 --> 00:05.769
I'm dying of old age. Goodbye.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.442
You're Katherine Pierce. Suck it up.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.924
I was 21051.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.610
You were an Augustine vampire?

00:15.440 --> 00:18.205
I'm sure Augustine
will be thrilled to have you back.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.407
That's my dad.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.928
Grayson Gilbert was one of the best doctors
the Augustines ever had.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.441
- Elena, wake up.
- What the hell is going on?

00:26.600 --> 00:29.444
I've been here before.
Believe it or not, I made a friend.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.090
My name's Enzo.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.248
You have to tell me
how you got out of here.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.606
Damon, now!

00:37.880 --> 00:39.928
- I'm sorry, Enzo.
- Damon, please.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.923
I turned off my emotions.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.686
- Damon!
- And I left my friend to die.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.167
Welcome.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.124
I'm 12144.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.361
My name is Enzo.

01:30.760 --> 01:31.886
Slick hands, cowboy.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.085
Come on.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.447
Oh, my God. No.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.169
Don't turn around.

03:04.360 --> 03:09.082
- What are you doing?
- Uh, just don't turn around.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.608
- Where are you going?
- Uh, everything's fine. Go back to bed.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.285
Unh. Ow.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.484
What the hell happened to you?

03:30.680 --> 03:33.684
Ditto. Elena's not here by any chance,
is she?

03:33.840 --> 03:35.171
I haven't seen her.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.489
- Not that I've been looking.
- Stef, you awake?

03:39.120 --> 03:43.603
You know, he hasn't seen her either.
I know because we were together.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.807
All night.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.084
Look, I've had a crappy couple days.
Okay?

03:49.240 --> 03:51.160
If you're implying
what I think you're implying...

03:51.200 --> 03:52.850
Why? What were you thinking?

03:53.040 --> 03:57.329
That our hot naked bodies collided
in one unforgettable night of passion?

03:57.480 --> 03:59.005
- I'm gonna barf.
- Great.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.170
Then my work here is done. Toodle-00.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.247
Ugh.

04:38.680 --> 04:42.002
Subject 83182 appears conscious.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.681
Where am I?

04:45.840 --> 04:47.888
Why? Look familiar?

04:52.080 --> 04:53.411
What is that thing?

04:54.160 --> 04:55.491
What are you doing to me?

04:56.960 --> 04:59.406
83182 commence prep for blood dialysis.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.171
Count from 10...

05:02.360 --> 05:04.601
nine, eight...

05:04.760 --> 05:06.285
<i>SEVEN...</i>

05:06.680 --> 05:09.923
six, five...

05:13.760 --> 05:14.886
Where the hell you been?

05:15.080 --> 05:18.448
Being held against my will,
shot in the head. Now I can't find Elena.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.728
How was your evening?
Anything happen?

05:20.920 --> 05:24.481
- What do you mean you can't find Elena?
- She's not picking up her phone.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.007
She's not in her dorm.
She's nowhere in this house.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.208
Dr. Creepy Ken Doll has her somewhere.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.930
The Whitmore bio teacher?

05:31.120 --> 05:33.282
Yeah, the one that operates on vampires?

05:33.440 --> 05:36.284
Yeah, that one. Put your hero hair on.
Let's go get Elena.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.760
You don't know where she is.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.049
I don't. We're gonna have
to find us some leverage. Come on.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.000
Pop quiz. Your girlfriend is
taken by a mad scientist.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.248
Now do you, A, get a new girlfriend...

05:52.400 --> 05:53.811
B, call the police...

05:54.040 --> 05:57.283
or C, kill someone close
to that mad scientist?

06:01.440 --> 06:02.771
Sit.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.330
Four-point-one pints drained.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.730
83182 still shows signs
of consciousness.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.043
Note that 15 years ago,
subject 12144...

06:15.200 --> 06:18.249
faded into unconsciousness
after losing 2.9 pints.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.801
Evolution or luck?

06:20.960 --> 06:23.122
A mystery for another day.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.001
What are you doing to me?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.770
What are these tubes?

06:28.280 --> 06:29.327
Let me go.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.001
Relax.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.811
I plan to. Once I'm through with you.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.162
My friends are gonna find me.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.930
Your heroic vampire friends?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.686
Did you know Aaron Whitmore
spent his entire life...

06:42.880 --> 06:46.168
thinking his family was haunted
by some death curse?

06:46.320 --> 06:48.641
Turns out that curse was your boyfriend.

06:49.120 --> 06:53.170
Systematically killing every member
on his family tree. I'm curious.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.684
- How does one justify that in her mind?
- And this?

06:57.360 --> 06:59.010
Holding people against their will?

06:59.600 --> 07:00.886
Torturing them?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.845
- How do you justify that?
- Science.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.651
"June 25, 1999. Incredible findings today.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.691
After enduring 3000 volts of electricity,
the subject continues to have a heartbeat.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.723
June 26. More success.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.962
Subject was exposed to 4000 volts today.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.208
Seizing continues after electrocution.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.845
Flesh remains hot to the touch."

07:22.840 --> 07:24.683
You're a monster.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.530
This isn't my journal, Elena.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.203
These are the handwritten medical findings
of Dr. Grayson Gilbert.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.046
Your father.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.765
What?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.848
Everything I'm doing to you...

07:40.000 --> 07:41.729
I learned from him.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.768
I have no idea where Wes took her.

07:45.960 --> 07:50.170
Well, they're not at his lab.
So where else could he hide a vampire?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.848
I'm sorry, am I supposed to know
who you are?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.240
That's my brother, Stefan.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.444
Watch your tone because he's in the midst
of a psychotic break.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.768
I'm sorry. I'm what?

07:59.960 --> 08:02.122
You don't think I know
about you and Katherine?

08:02.280 --> 08:04.408
Oh, I see.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.444
- You're jealous.
- More like disturbed.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.562
See? He's off his rocker.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.564
He's losing his mind.
Teetering on the brink of insanity.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.331
How are you not dead? I shot you.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.961
You went for the head.
You gotta go for the heart.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.724
Go for the heart next time.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.565
Now, where's Elena?

08:23.520 --> 08:24.931
I have no idea.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.800
All that Wes told me
was to go about my life as usual.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.406
Call Wes and tell him
if he doesn't give us Elena...

08:30.560 --> 08:34.360
the next experiment that he conducts
is gonna be sewing your arms back on.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.207
This is my dad's clinic.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.086
We're in the basement.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.329
Was your dad's clinic.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.883
Then your town council burned
a whole bunch of vampires down here.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.203
Now it's just a condemned building
in Mystic Falls where no one will find us.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.644
Aaron. Hey.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.080
Do you have Elena?

09:09.240 --> 09:10.651
Aaron, what's wrong?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.883
Uh, Stefan and Damon are gonna kill me
unless you give them Elena.

09:14.040 --> 09:18.648
Damon Salvatore is locked in an impenetrable
and inescapable fortified cell.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.322
Or he's in front of me imagining
what my kidney would taste like.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.007
Fine. Meet me in my classroom.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.084
Once I see you're safe,
tell them I'll give them Elena.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.685
Enzo?

09:43.640 --> 09:44.971
Enzo, wake up.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.409
When was the last time
you were out in civilization?

09:55.120 --> 09:56.531
What's that?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.803
An insurance policy.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.122
It guarantees you'll come back to me.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.121
I'm giving you the day off.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.127
You and Damon
have some catching up to do.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.082
I don't hear you counting.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.881
Three, four, five, six...

10:29.080 --> 10:30.241
Good try.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.602
Good try? That was horrible, Matt.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.602
Come on.
I'm paying you to make me hot again.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.006
Whip me into shape and prolong
this death thing as long as possible.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.931
- Yeah, that'll happen.
- What did you say?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.926
No, seriously, I didn't hear you.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.406
Oh, my God, I'm going deaf.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.928
I'm going deaf.
My entire body is falling apart.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.924
Oh, God. I can't breathe.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.250
I can't breathe. Water.
Give me some water.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.523
- Faster.
- Deep breaths.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.768
If you're so anxious not to be dead...

11:05.920 --> 11:07.763
why don't you just have
a vampire turn you?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.121
Tried that.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.089
Every time I ingest vampire blood...

11:12.240 --> 11:14.481
my body rejects it.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.321
Who is that? I can't see.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.165
It's Nadia. I told her you were here.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.846
"Dear Nadia.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.647
Sorry I had to kill your boyfriend,
but it was the motherly thing to do.

11:35.840 --> 11:39.162
Suicide, however,
not very motherly of me."

11:39.320 --> 11:42.085
Great, so, um, Stefan obviously gave you
my suicide note.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.641
What's your point?

11:46.800 --> 11:47.961
Damn.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.010
That's for trying to kill yourself
without saying goodbye.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.803
You wanna give me a little back story
as to how you know one another?

11:55.960 --> 11:57.371
Aaron is Aaron Whitmore.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.484
He comes from a long line
of vampire-probing, blood-testing...

12:00.640 --> 12:02.802
organ-removing freaks
called Augustine.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.567
- Why do you know this?
- Because I was their test subject in the '50s.

12:06.720 --> 12:10.167
- What do you mean test subject?
- Meaning I donated my body to science.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.005
Except I was alive
and it was against my will.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.322
Wait, hold on a minute.
How do I not know about this?

12:16.680 --> 12:19.280
Don't get all guilt-ridden Stefan on me.
We were on the outs then.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.844
And by the time it was over,
you know, it was over.

12:24.280 --> 12:28.126
- Why don't you finish the story?
- I don't recall saying that you could talk.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.206
Did I say he could talk?

12:31.080 --> 12:33.481
- I don't remember anything.
- I didn't think so.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.203
I get it now.

12:38.440 --> 12:42.047
If I was living here,
I'd wanna kill myself too.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.487
It was a moment of weakness. I'm over it.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.167
In a moment of weakness,
you eat chocolate or kiss the wrong boy.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.644
You don't jump off a clock tower.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.040
Do you see this?

12:52.200 --> 12:53.247
This is raw kale.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.086
In what universe
would I put this inside of my body...

12:57.240 --> 13:00.403
unless I actually wanted
to live another day?

13:00.560 --> 13:01.721
Okay.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.083
Then what changed your mind?

13:04.560 --> 13:09.202
It's not so much a matter of what,
as it is who.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.166
Can I ask you something...

13:11.640 --> 13:14.405
absentee mother
to mildly abusive daughter?

13:16.360 --> 13:17.771
I'm listening.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.251
Do you think...

13:20.440 --> 13:23.444
after all the horrible things
that I've done...

13:23.600 --> 13:25.602
it would be possible to be forgiven?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.090
Of course I do.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.241
That's actually why I'm here.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.243
I may have an idea
that will keep you alive longer.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.763
I'm listening.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.642
When did you meet my dad?

14:21.320 --> 14:25.564
He was working with Augustine to turn
vampire blood into a magical cure-all...

14:25.720 --> 14:27.006
to fight disease...

14:27.160 --> 14:29.970
cure cancer, save the world.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.480
Do you know if he ever brought
a vampire down here?

14:40.320 --> 14:43.164
I remember coming down here as a kid.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.689
There was something about this place
that always creeped me out.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.282
Wes, I saw Enzo...

14:56.440 --> 14:58.522
when I woke up.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.645
I know he's alive.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.171
Where is he?

15:04.680 --> 15:06.011
He's on a little day trip.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.209
Apparently, he has some
unresolved business with your boyfriend.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.291
What did you do?

15:12.400 --> 15:13.481
What did you do?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.451
What did you do?

15:18.320 --> 15:21.210
- Which one is it?
- It's right here.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.441
21051.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.166
Enzo?

15:38.640 --> 15:40.085
It's been a while, mate.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.443
- Who the hell are you?
- Lorenzo.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.523
But my friends call me Enzo.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.284
Ah. Kidding. I don't have any friends.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.650
Enzo's another Augustine vampire.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.442
Our cells were next to each other.
So we're here to meet somebody.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.285
- Wes. Do you know him?
- That's your first question for me?

16:16.480 --> 16:19.848
Not, "How are you? How did you survive
in that fire I left you to die in?"

16:20.040 --> 16:23.283
Uh, does somebody wanna tell me
what's going on here?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.044
I'd love to. Have a seat.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.005
I've been waiting 70 years
to tell my story.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.851
Enzo is the Augustine vampire.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.688
He killed my roommate Megan, didn't he?

16:42.880 --> 16:44.120
Conserve your energy.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.721
We've drained enough blood
to start phase two.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.848
Let me guess.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.640
You're not gonna tell me
what phase two is, are you?

16:51.800 --> 16:54.690
If it works, you'll be
the first one to know.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.803
Why did Megan have a picture of my dad
in her cell phone?

17:03.040 --> 17:06.010
Maybe because her parents
helped fund your father's projects.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.167
They knew about Augustine too?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.729
Well, no.

17:10.960 --> 17:14.646
They knew your dad had an unregulated
compound that could cure most injuries.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.319
Vampire blood.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.766
Exactly.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.611
But as Megan grew up,
she got suspicious.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.531
Enrolled at Whitmore.
Roomed with Dr. Gilbert's daughter.

17:24.680 --> 17:28.526
Then went to a party at Whitmore House
and put her nose where it didn't belong.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.210
She found Enzo in his cell.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.483
And being clueless to what a starving
vampire will do around human blood...

17:33.640 --> 17:35.085
I'm guessing she got too close.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.681
Aaron.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.247
- Where's Elena?
- Who's this?

17:42.400 --> 17:45.210
We have Aaron and we're trying to decide
how to kill him.

17:45.760 --> 17:50.561
Funny. I have Elena and I'm wondering how
she'll function without her cerebral cortex.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.361
Touch him and you'll never see her again.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.881
That threat works both ways.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.251
Damon and I had been locked
in those cells for years.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.603
Tortured, beaten, humiliated.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.123
But we weren't gonna let them break us.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.450
No. We decided if we were gonna escape,
we needed to work together.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.687
We needed each other.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.769
- He's not sending her.
- Tragic.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.611
- Can I continue my story?
- Doesn't he know we have Aaron?

18:21.800 --> 18:23.643
He doesn't care. He's willing to risk it.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.729
Let me talk to him. He'll listen to me.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.804
What part of "he doesn't care"
are you not registering?

18:32.640 --> 18:33.846
Where were we?

18:34.000 --> 18:38.403
Uh, oh, right. I was telling my story
and you were all politely listening.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.324
Eh? So I'd given Damon
all of my blood rations...

18:44.560 --> 18:47.848
so he'd have the strength to escape
and save me in the process.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.442
Our plan began perfectly. Didn't it?

18:57.840 --> 19:00.081
I was waiting in the cage
for him to release me.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.089
Waiting for my friend...

19:03.120 --> 19:04.485
my cell mate...

19:04.680 --> 19:08.765
the only soul with whom I'd connected
with in all those years of captivity.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.047
Then a fire starts. Burns out of control.

19:15.240 --> 19:18.449
But Damon just can't get
the damn cage open.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.326
He looks me in the eye...

19:27.560 --> 19:31.645
as if he doesn't even recognize me,
turns around, saves himself.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.401
<i>Leaving me to die.</i>

19:40.480 --> 19:42.721
You didn't die, obviously.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.208
No, unfortunately I lived.
I was spared by one of the scientists...

19:46.360 --> 19:50.001
so I could spend another 50 years
on a table being opened and closed.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.610
Now that we've all been acquainted...

19:53.760 --> 19:56.411
I'm gonna go find something
to wet my whistle.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.845
You didn't tell me about him.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.083
It was the 1950s. I'm supposed
to remember every moment of my life?

20:03.280 --> 20:06.602
- You wanna kill Aaron or should I?
- This guy was your cell mate.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.366
You left him to die.
He comes back and you're unfazed.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.523
- Fine. I will.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.923
Hold on, hold on. Wes gave me
a bunch of files on my family history.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.726
In my dorm. Maybe there's
something in there you need.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.922
A name? I mean, another lab?

20:20.120 --> 20:21.406
That's a timely revelation.

20:21.560 --> 20:25.007
Yeah, you know, he's not gonna
help me, so why should I help him?

20:25.240 --> 20:27.811
I don't like you. I don't like your family.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.371
I don't like you messing
with my relationship.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.329
If you're lying,
I'm gonna take my thumbs...

20:31.480 --> 20:34.370
and gouge out your sad little eyes
out of your sad little head.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.370
Ah! It's frightening what you can find
on campus.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.443
Knock yourself out.
We're going with plan B.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.524
Damon's not. Damon's staying right here.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.250
He knows all my secrets...

20:44.400 --> 20:47.688
so he knows how ornery I can get
when I don't get my way.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.206
Call me if you find anything.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.407
Kill him if you don't.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.684
Let's go.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.200
You didn't just propose spirit possession
with a straight face?

21:00.400 --> 21:04.769
You said my grandfather was a Traveler,
which means your father was a Traveler...

21:04.960 --> 21:06.325
therefore you are a Traveler.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.926
We just need one
who can teach you the Passenger Spell.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.090
Hang on. I'm hardly a Traveler, okay?

21:12.280 --> 21:15.011
My father banned us
from doing Traveler magic.

21:15.160 --> 21:19.006
He said it was the Devil's work,
or something dramatic that terrified us.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.644
And then I became a vampire
and never thought about it again.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.006
But it's in your blood.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.091
Which means you have the ability
to keep living inside someone else's body.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.765
Gregor was a Traveler.

21:29.960 --> 21:34.522
He put his spirit inside Matt, so that
even after his body died, he lived on.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.929
Yes, he lived on. In a busboy.

21:38.120 --> 21:42.091
Good idea, Nadia.
Let's put my essence in some nobody.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.844
Thing is, Stefan actually likes this body.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.850
What are you talking about?

21:50.040 --> 21:53.965
Stefan and I may have rekindled
an old flame last night.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.805
I see.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.649
So when you asked me
about forgiveness...

22:03.360 --> 22:05.522
you were asking about him...

22:05.960 --> 22:07.166
not me?

22:07.320 --> 22:09.971
Look, maybe I don't wanna die...

22:10.120 --> 22:13.249
a sad, lonely 538-year-old.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.009
If I have to bow out...

22:16.200 --> 22:19.647
knowing that Stefan still cares
might not be the worst way to go.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.404
No, you had it right the first time.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.001
Go kill yourself.
See if anyone misses you.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.365
What about cricket?

22:42.560 --> 22:44.562
Did that ever become a thing here?

22:45.080 --> 22:47.765
- No.
- Oh, shame.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.491
Fun sport. Not that I can play.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.170
Took up drawing for a while.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.765
Of course I had no pencils.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.606
I'd just prick my finger
and paint the cell wall with my blood.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.171
What do you want?

23:00.920 --> 23:04.606
You want me to feel guilty?
I couldn't save you.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.847
Now, where's Elena?

23:09.240 --> 23:10.287
What's wrong with you?

23:10.480 --> 23:13.006
Wes injected me with poison
that'll stop my heart.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.368
I'll desiccate if I don't return
for the antidote.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.361
All the more reason
to tell me where he is.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.962
You get the antidote, I'll save my
girlfriend, we'll kill Wes together.

23:22.160 --> 23:25.881
Did you even think about it after you left?
The experiments, the cell?

23:26.400 --> 23:30.485
Or did you just go out
and live your merry life to its fullest?

23:30.640 --> 23:33.962
Look at me.
If you go back, we go back together.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.849
We finish this for good.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.566
Come on.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.562
You're not gonna see your girl again,
Damon.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.644
Because I want the antidote, and Wes told
me not to come back until you were dead.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.725
I imagine you just broke your clavicle.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.770
Probably a few lumbar
and thoracic vertebrae.

24:06.600 --> 24:11.322
It's funny what you learn about your body
when it's taken apart right before your eyes.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.130
I'm not gonna fight you, Enzo.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.721
What are you gonna do, then? Run?

24:16.880 --> 24:18.086
You're good at that.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.762
I wanna find my girlfriend.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.047
All right?

24:26.520 --> 24:29.763
While you were out running wild,
I had one single thought...

24:29.920 --> 24:31.888
that of the pleasure of killing you.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.485
Enzo, look at me.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.563
- Bloody poison!
- Where is she?

24:41.720 --> 24:45.611
- Where is Elena? Tell me where she is!
- Or what? You'll never see her again.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.481
It might be good for you to know what
it's like to miss someone for 60 years.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.566
Enzo, look at me.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.843
Hey! Enzo! Where is she? Where is she?

24:55.000 --> 24:56.286
Enzo, hey.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.080
All the files of my family history
are in here.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.930
Hurry UP-

25:22.280 --> 25:23.406
Was this all a lie, huh?

25:24.080 --> 25:27.562
If you want me to kill you, I will kill you.
Do not test me.

25:27.720 --> 25:31.520
I'm dead already. Damon's been planning
my death since before I was born.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.011
What are you talking about?

25:33.160 --> 25:37.006
Damon left out the best part of the
Augustine story, the part after he escaped.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.401
Talk.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.922
It wasn't enough for Damon
to kill the doctors who tortured him.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.764
He had to torture their families...

25:48.920 --> 25:50.524
and their future families.

25:50.680 --> 25:54.969
He spent the last 60 years
killing every one of my relatives.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.525
Except he's a psychopath.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.930
He keeps one alive
so they can continue the family line.

26:01.120 --> 26:05.205
So that he can destroy future generations
of innocent people.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.522
So go ahead and do it. Kill me.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.684
Because I don't wanna give Damon
the satisfaction, so do it.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.889
Do it!

26:17.000 --> 26:20.800
You know,
not all of us are like my brother.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.771
Stefan?

26:34.840 --> 26:37.889
This is everything Wes gave me
on Augustine.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.482
I saw Elena's last name on a few pages.
Maybe it'll help.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.041
Hey.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.289
You're not supposed to be down here.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.649
- Basement's a kid-free zone, remember?
- I heard someone screaming.

27:25.800 --> 27:30.203
Oh, it's okay. Everything's fine.
In fact, today's a good day, Elena.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.091
- Why?
- Daddy's gonna save a little girl's life.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.607
She's about the same age as you.
Pretty cool, huh?

27:36.280 --> 27:38.806
All right, get out of here.
Doctor's orders.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.724
Okay, Dad.

27:42.120 --> 27:47.251
Good news. The sample cells mutated.
My compound worked.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.803
I don't follow.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.008
You kicked me out of Bio, remember?

27:52.160 --> 27:53.446
You've heard of Pavlov.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.206
Conditioned his dog to salivate
at the sound of a bell.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.563
This compound is like that bell,
except, instead of a ding...

27:59.720 --> 28:02.405
your body will salivate
at the smell of vampire blood.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.641
Oh, my God.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.530
That's what you did to Jesse.

28:06.680 --> 28:12.244
You turned him into some rabid vampire
who only wanted to feed on other vampires.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.802
Jesse was a fantastic case study,
but he took too long to condition.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.002
Considering the size
of the vampire population...

28:18.160 --> 28:20.401
a single-dose injection
is much more efficient.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.404
Yeah, but he couldn't stop feeding.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.091
He tried to kill Damon.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.450
Exactly. Vampires are now one shot away
from craving their own kind.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.443
And you're about to be Patient Zero.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.931
What?

28:35.080 --> 28:38.129
No. No, you can't do that to me.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.521
You'll turn me into a ripper.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.370
I know.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.481
Subject 83182,
prep for compound injection.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.846
No. No.

28:55.040 --> 28:58.726
- Please, you can't do this to me.
- You'll be doing the world a favor, Elena.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.131
- I might not be able to kill vampires...
- No. Let me go.

29:04.440 --> 29:05.726
- ...but you will.
- No.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.401
- Elena!
- Stefan!

29:12.000 --> 29:15.607
- I'm down here. I'm here. Stefan.
- Oh, God.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.284
Come here.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.842
You're okay. I got you.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.530
L got you, l got you.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.250
<i>L</i> 90'! you.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.485
Get me out of here.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.246
Come on. Come on.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.164
Wait. Wait, wait.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.210
Look, we're closing, so...

29:56.880 --> 29:59.724
We met on a little patio like this.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.121
Remember?

30:02.120 --> 30:05.169
The twinkly lights, music.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.725
That was a fun night.

30:07.880 --> 30:10.804
Yeah, I'd kind of rather just put us, uh...

30:10.960 --> 30:12.200
behind us.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.410
Fine.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.727
Will do.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.288
But I need you to hold onto this for me.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.530
The Traveler's knife?

30:23.680 --> 30:26.524
- No way. I just got rid of that thing.
- It's not about you.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.721
I'm leaving Mystic Falls.
I need to know it's safe.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.486
Why? And why do people want it?

30:33.680 --> 30:36.331
I thought I could convince Katherine
to live longer.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.291
I was wrong.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.489
But if she changes her mind,
she will need this.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.930
That's all you need to know.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.570
Well, she won't.

30:48.160 --> 30:52.165
Because Katherine cares about Katherine
and only Katherine.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.322
If she doesn't wanna do something,
she won't.

31:00.920 --> 31:03.161
I spent 500 years searching for her.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.370
I finally find her
only to lose her all over again.

31:11.160 --> 31:15.006
I don't know if I should hate her
for giving up...

31:15.240 --> 31:18.084
or be at her side when she dies.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.251
Listen.

31:27.280 --> 31:30.887
I get the whole crappy parenting thing.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.282
My mom kind of sucked.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.888
She was selfish and...

31:37.680 --> 31:41.810
she drank too much and never really
thought about how it would affect me.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.843
Then you know what it's like
to hold on to the hope...

31:47.600 --> 31:51.286
that maybe, just once...

31:52.600 --> 31:54.887
she'll do what you want.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.687
If she changes her mind...

32:08.840 --> 32:11.127
the knife will be with me.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.563
Yeah.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.008
Huh. Never mind.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.924
What did you do now?

32:32.080 --> 32:35.527
Well, I injected you with a bunch of these
that say "antidote."

32:35.720 --> 32:37.245
Apparently, one of them worked.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.885
If this is some attempt to make amends,
it's pathetic.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.485
I don't care about amends.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.846
My girlfriend's safe,
so technically I'm not suffering.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.048
And it would suck
if you desiccated in vain.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.409
And I wanted to tell you
my side of the story.

32:55.560 --> 32:59.121
You asked me if I thought about you
after I escaped, and the answer is no.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.402
And I didn't feel guilty about leaving you.

33:01.560 --> 33:05.281
Because in order for me to save myself
and leave you...

33:06.240 --> 33:08.288
I had to shut off my humanity, damn it.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.129
So I flipped the switch.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.291
And I felt nothing.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.802
No remorse, no regret.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.451
No pain.

33:19.640 --> 33:20.721
And now...

33:21.480 --> 33:23.289
what do you feel...

33:23.520 --> 33:24.646
remorse?

33:24.800 --> 33:25.881
Regret?

33:26.040 --> 33:27.644
Pain?

33:28.640 --> 33:31.769
Even if I forgave you, Damon,
would that make you less horrible?

33:33.760 --> 33:35.524
We're even, Enzo.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.323
You were the most important person
in my life, and you ruined me.

33:46.320 --> 33:49.324
That's just who you are.
It's who you'll always be.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.324
A monster.

34:20.159 --> 34:24.245
It's weird. Even as a kid, something
about that basement creeped me out.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.801
Sure you wanna give yourself nightmares
reading that thing?

34:27.000 --> 34:28.239
Mm.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.446
I remember my dad talking
about this little girl.

34:33.080 --> 34:37.802
I think he was talking about my roommate,
Megan. Look, "January, 1999.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.406
Saw Megan King today.
Megan is <i>7</i> years old.

34:40.560 --> 34:44.849
She suffers from a congenital heart defect
with a life expectancy of two months.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.164
A single injection of vampire blood appears
to be an effective life-saving solution."

34:49.320 --> 34:52.641
That's why Megan had a picture of my dad,
because he saved her life.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.929
Hundred pages of horrific torture
and you find the one happy passage.

34:56.080 --> 34:59.243
My dad used his research
to save people, Damon.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.050
Children, families.

35:01.240 --> 35:03.447
Yeah, and dissected vampires
along the way.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.126
Newsflash, Elena, you are a vampire.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.363
Do you honestly think that
he would see you as anything more?

35:10.760 --> 35:12.000
I don't know.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.568
He's my dad. I can't not defend him.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.927
No, I know you can't.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.684
You do it for me all the time.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.930
I'm not defending you.

35:21.120 --> 35:25.045
I'm not defending your decision
to kill Aaron's entire family.

35:25.600 --> 35:29.400
To go out of town and kill his aunt
while we were still together.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.886
So why are you still here?

35:32.200 --> 35:35.283
I'm bad, Elena. I am bad for you.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.365
Why wouldn't you run away from me
as far as possible?

35:39.520 --> 35:41.204
Because I love you, Damon.

35:41.360 --> 35:44.648
Because I chose you,
and because I stand by my choice.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.728
And now I'm choosing.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.728
And I'm choosing to let you go.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.445
What?

35:56.520 --> 35:57.931
No, Damon...

35:58.080 --> 36:00.731
I am choosing to not have to think
about how you feel...

36:00.880 --> 36:03.531
every time some ghost from my past
comes into our life.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.768
I'm choosing to relieve you...

36:05.920 --> 36:09.003
of having to defend me
for every awful thing I've ever done.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.605
Stop acting like I'm perfect.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.441
Damon, I've done horrible things too.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.568
Think I'm gonna stand here
and judge you...

36:15.720 --> 36:19.884
- ..after I find out you've been tortured?
- Stop defending me!

36:24.480 --> 36:26.562
I won't change who I am.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.370
I can't.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.721
But I refuse to change you.

37:08.720 --> 37:13.806
Can I come in, or are you gonna
freak out and run away again?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.206
I'm getting wrinkles.

37:17.120 --> 37:21.284
Katherine Pierce's chickens come home
to roost in the form of wrinkles.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.246
It's kind of brilliant.

37:23.400 --> 37:27.325
What's the opposite of funny?
Oh, right. Not funny.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.561
Hmm.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.566
So, what are you, uh, doing in my room?

37:32.040 --> 37:33.849
I wanna talk about last night.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.884
Okay.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.929
So talk.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.126
Well, um...

37:44.400 --> 37:46.482
It was a long day.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.846
We had a moment,
and we got swept up in it.

37:51.640 --> 37:54.166
Did you memorize that from...

37:54.640 --> 37:57.405
- ...a textbook or something?
- Katherine, what do you expect?

37:57.560 --> 38:00.723
You want me to just forget everything
that you've put me through...

38:00.960 --> 38:02.962
for the last 147 years?

38:03.640 --> 38:05.802
I'm dying, Stefan.

38:05.960 --> 38:10.170
I know you are, and I'm sure
that you will figure a way out of it.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.927
No. I mean, it's for real this time.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.200
Look at me.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.044
I'm dying.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.409
What does someone have to go through
to get a little redemption?

38:24.280 --> 38:26.681
A hundred and forty-seven years...

38:26.840 --> 38:30.447
is a long time to forgive in one night.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.289
One night.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.283
An eternity.

38:40.280 --> 38:44.285
You'd never look at me
the way you look at Elena, would you?

38:52.640 --> 38:54.051
Good night, Stefan.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.246
<i>Hey-</i>

39:08.320 --> 39:11.164
I'm sorry that you're dying.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.650
Trust me...

39:26.040 --> 39:27.610
I am too.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.686
Wes? Wes.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.681
Aaron.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.044
What the hell is this place, huh?

39:53.240 --> 39:54.924
One of Augustine's research labs.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.283
You really think that you're helping people
with this vampire crap?

39:58.480 --> 40:01.768
You sold me out,
used my life as a bargaining chip.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.248
Aaron, I'm sorry.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.370
I never wanna see you again.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.162
Get the hell out of my life.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.889
Aaron!

40:56.360 --> 40:58.681
So do we have a deal?

40:58.840 --> 41:01.810
You'll find me a Traveler
that'll teach me how to do the spell?

41:01.960 --> 41:04.486
I guess this means you want to live?

41:04.640 --> 41:08.565
I'm a survivor.
Staying alive is my specialty.

41:08.720 --> 41:11.803
Mm. Assuming, of course,
it's on your terms.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.328
Clearly Stefan inspired
some profound thinking.

41:16.480 --> 41:20.565
I think Stefan believes
that a part of me can still be redeemed.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.724
And what do you think? Is he right?

41:31.960 --> 41:33.450
Hello?

41:43.720 --> 41:44.960
Katherine?

41:46.800 --> 41:48.450
Katherine?
