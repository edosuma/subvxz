My God, I don't believe it.

What makes you think
your brother's in trouble?

00:17.118 --> 00:20.087
His two friends tried to leave the
group, and a week later were found dead.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.243
Jump.

00:22.156 --> 00:25.922
You failed to mention that your
hot clue involved total immersion.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.319
Get down!

02:18.339 --> 02:20.330
Higgins, you down there?

02:20.508 --> 02:21.634
Yes.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.405
Just a moment, please.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.907
I'm sorry. I was looking
for Jonathan Higgins.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.618
Magnum, what do you want?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.620
What are you doing?

02:34.688 --> 02:37.521
Agatha and her friends are
arguing over who stands where...

02:37.591 --> 02:39.786
the rental company just
arrived with all the costumes...

02:39.860 --> 02:42.454
and some carpenter asked me
to pay him for your stage...

02:42.530 --> 02:46.022
and I find you in here shadow
slashing. Yes, yes. I'm coming.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.360
Really, Magnum, I don't think you
understand the creative temperament.

02:49.437 --> 02:53.203
As the director, I carry the entire
emotional burden of this production.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.509
I was merely reviewing
the score in private.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.344
Oh, really? Looks to me like
you were practicing for a part.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.638
The lead?

03:02.917 --> 03:05.579
Naturally, a responsible
director would be prepared...

03:05.653 --> 03:09.214
to step in at a moment's notice in case
one of his cast members became ill.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.186
Just another of the many
obligations of being a director.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.352
Constantly tugged
in one direction or another...

03:14.428 --> 03:16.623
expected to be
in three places at once...

03:16.697 --> 03:18.927
and here you are,
making more demands on me.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.266
Honestly, Magnum, what

With all I have to do...

03:49.263 --> 03:52.255
and you still haven't made arrangements
for security for the performance?

03:52.333 --> 03:53.561
Well, I talked
to Rick and T.C...

03:53.634 --> 03:56.694
but they said they didn't want to
hang out with a bunch of opera guys.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.796
The Sandwich Islands Savoyards
and Sir Cedric Brooke...

03:59.874 --> 04:01.637
are hardly a bunch
of opera guys.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.734
Well, I'm sure they didn't
mean any offense by it.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.780
All right, what do
you want? The darkroom.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.680
I want unrestricted use of the
darkroom, and we have a deal.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.976
Very well.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.083
<i>Okay, guys.
This is pretty good.</i>

04:16.156 --> 04:18.250
<i>It's coming along.
Now let's take a break.</i>

04:19.360 --> 04:21.123
All right, lads.
Thank you.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.720
Now, <i>Three Little Maids,</i>
with the piano.

04:24.899 --> 04:28.528
I don't believe it.
Now Big Harry canceled.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.264
I am trying to talk to you about
this important security job...

04:31.338 --> 04:33.533
and all you want to talk
about is some poker game?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.733
Not "some" poker game.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.709
The biggest game this Island's
ever seen, with the richest pot.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.746
And now, I don't have
anywhere to play.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.211
Oh, I already told you. I am not
interested in standing guard...

04:43.284 --> 04:45.309
at Higgins' latest
charity event.

04:45.386 --> 04:49.288
But this won't even seem like
working. You can see the show for free.

04:49.356 --> 04:53.383
I saw Higgins'
show last year. Count me out.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.088
Well, I wouldn't even be
doing this myself...

04:56.163 --> 04:59.792
except someone has to ensure the safety of
these beautiful girls in the chorus line.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.062
Girls? What girls?
Excuse me.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.599
I was told I might find
Thomas Magnum here.

05:04.672 --> 05:08.005
I can wait if you're busy. Busy?
Are you kidding? Come on, sit down.

05:08.075 --> 05:11.306
Are you Mr. Magnum?
No, I'm Thomas Magnum.

05:11.378 --> 05:14.040
We're his associates. Yes.
What can we help you with?

05:14.114 --> 05:17.311
I don't have any associates.
Thomas, what are you talking about?

05:17.384 --> 05:19.113
We were just talking
about the security job...

05:19.186 --> 05:20.380
the three of us
were going to take.

05:20.454 --> 05:24.481
Right. If you'll just come with me, we
can discuss this in private over here.

05:24.692 --> 05:25.716
Wow.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.594
Well, better luck
next time, buddy.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.964
Think that's one of the chorus
girls he was talking about?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.560
This was taken in
his senior year in school.

05:37.905 --> 05:41.238
Look at that smile. Such
an honest and trusting face.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.367
What makes you think
your brother's in trouble?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.435
Well, for the first few months
after he got here...

05:45.512 --> 05:47.377
we talked on the phone
almost every week.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.439
He had these plans
for me to come over.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.143
I'm just a graduate student
in music.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.846
How was I going to get
the money to come to Hawaii?

05:54.822 --> 05:58.451
Then he and his two buddies
joined this eastern chanting group.

05:59.260 --> 06:00.352
I don't know, he...

06:00.427 --> 06:03.658
He became a different person.
He was so distant, and cold.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.458
And then he
stopped calling altogether.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.626
You think they're holding him
against his will?

06:08.702 --> 06:12.263
The last time I talked to him, he was
so belligerent, I did some checking.

06:12.973 --> 06:16.101
I found out that his two friends
tried to leave the group...

06:16.176 --> 06:17.939
and a week later
were found dead.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.875
How did they die?
Drowned.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.945
The police say
it was an accident.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.408
Well, I'm sorry to...

06:25.786 --> 06:28.277
Listen, your brother-
I haven't seen him since.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.355
Do you have an address,
anything to go on?

06:30.424 --> 06:32.949
Yes, but if they know
that we're looking for him...

06:33.027 --> 06:34.517
No, we'll be careful.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.794
<i>Eric's address was one of...</i>

06:36.864 --> 06:38.695
<i>the roughest neighborhoods
in Honolulu.</i>

06:38.766 --> 06:40.233
<i>Or anywhere else.</i>

06:40.301 --> 06:44.362
<i>Most people who lived here weren't
in trouble. They were past trouble.</i>

06:49.977 --> 06:51.911
Eric wouldn't live like this.

06:53.314 --> 06:55.612
I know something
has happened to him.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.913
I mean, if he's still alive...

06:57.985 --> 06:59.350
he's not himself.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.577
This group
that he hooked up with...

07:03.490 --> 07:05.685
did he say anything
about their activities?

07:05.759 --> 07:09.627
Well, he told me that they give
all of their material belongings...

07:09.697 --> 07:11.130
to their spiritual leader.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.457
And that they do honest labor
for their soul's salvation...

07:15.536 --> 07:17.333
and give the money to the poor.

07:18.739 --> 07:19.933
What is it?

07:20.607 --> 07:21.733
"Help wanted."

07:21.842 --> 07:23.935
Shipping lines,
unloading freight.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.205
It's circled.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.041
Honest labor.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.312
Maybe I can find him there.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.182
Listen, I'm gonna
take you back to your hotel...

07:33.253 --> 07:35.050
and check this out.
Where are you staying?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.283
I don't really have a hotel.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.592
I can just...
I'll stay here.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.253
I can't leave you here.
It's not safe.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.296
I don't know what else to do.

I believe I detect
a glimmer of improvement.

08:38.452 --> 08:41.511
However, your fan work
is still woefully inadequate.

08:41.587 --> 08:44.148
But, Jonathan,
it's so difficult.

08:44.491 --> 08:48.291
First, the steps. Then when
we learned that, the fans.

08:48.429 --> 08:51.489
Yes, then the dance steps.
Don't forget all of them.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.295
And my poor swollen ankles.

08:54.368 --> 08:58.805
Since 1885, when Gilbert and Sullivan's
immortal <i>Mikado</i> was first presented...

08:58.872 --> 09:02.774
the <i>Three Little Maids</i> have performed this
song exactly as I have taught it to you.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.310
In your hands, ladies...

09:04.378 --> 09:07.870
is a tradition stretching back to
the glorious days of the Empire.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.209
You, too, will uphold it.
Yes, even cherish it.

09:11.285 --> 09:12.775
Higgins?
Excuse me.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.111
Ladies.
Hello, Agatha.

09:15.189 --> 09:17.316
I'd like you to meet Sally
De Forest. Hello.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.882
About my poor swollen ankle...

09:20.727 --> 09:23.252
couldn't we possibly
eliminate...

09:23.330 --> 09:26.527
just one difficult step
in the dance?

09:26.600 --> 09:27.999
Impossible.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.035
Our guest star, Sir Cedric Brooke,
will have no rehearsal time with us.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.403
He will arrive prepared to step into
the classic blocking and staging.

09:34.475 --> 09:38.206
And you ladies must not fail
him. We will try yet again.

09:40.180 --> 09:44.378
Magnum, unless you're here to explain that
this young woman is a security expert...

09:44.451 --> 09:46.817
No, no, no.
Sally de Forest is a client.

09:46.887 --> 09:47.876
Oh, really?

09:48.789 --> 09:51.155
And I have a small favor
to ask. Nothing important.

09:51.225 --> 09:54.126
It just seems that Sally's had
a run of bad luck lately and-

09:54.194 --> 09:56.924
Starting with hiring you
as her investigator, no doubt.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.296
I'll ignore that, and I told her
there would be absolutely no problem...

10:00.367 --> 10:03.495
none whatsoever, with her
staying here on the estate...

10:03.570 --> 10:06.232
in one of the many, many empty
rooms which are always ready...

10:06.306 --> 10:09.764
completely prepared in the spirit of
hospitality Robin Masters is famous for.

10:09.843 --> 10:13.142
Miss De Forest, I regret that what
Magnum proposed is out of the question.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.237
Higgins.
As you can see...

10:14.314 --> 10:17.613
all energies are devoted to the
final preparations for our operetta.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.653
An unanticipated guest
is not part of those plans.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.916
I could just go back to Eric's.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.082
She plays piano, Higgins.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.290
Modestly, I am a superb...

10:27.361 --> 10:30.091
albeit completely self-taught,
rehearsal pianist.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.189
Yes, but, if she
were playing piano...

10:33.267 --> 10:37.033
you could be on stage,
directing your actors.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.730
Well, perhaps...

10:39.806 --> 10:42.104
I mean, you can't be
expected to do everything...

10:42.175 --> 10:44.837
constantly being tugged
in one direction or another.

10:45.279 --> 10:48.214
Well, it would give me
an opportunity to step back...

10:48.282 --> 10:50.750
and look at the production
objectively.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.245
Well, just give her
a chance, Higgins.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.050
If she doesn't do a good job,
she'll leave. No hard feelings.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.590
It would be a pleasure.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.327
It's not often I get to
practice on such a fine piano.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.499
Confidentially, Higgins, I
have a hot lead on this case.

11:08.569 --> 11:10.696
There's every chance I'll
wrap it up by this evening.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.438
A true gentleman...

11:23.083 --> 11:24.380
a British gentleman...

11:24.818 --> 11:25.807
would say yes.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.288
Ladies.

12:09.463 --> 12:10.794
<i>When I write my book...</i>

12:10.864 --> 12:12.695
<i>on how to be a world-class
private investigator...</i>

12:12.766 --> 12:15.894
<i>I'm going to include a special
chapter on observation.</i>

12:16.269 --> 12:19.033
<i>Now, even though I've trained my
eye to pick up every detail...</i>

12:19.106 --> 12:22.303
<i>I still take
pictures just to be absolutely sure.</i>

12:22.609 --> 12:26.511
<i>After all, even a professional
eye can't be as good as a camera.</i>

13:18.799 --> 13:20.994
Hi guys.
How's it going?

13:21.468 --> 13:22.799
What you want, brother?

13:22.869 --> 13:25.337
Refrigerators. I got to pick
up a load of refrigerators.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.364
I got the invoice here someplace.
This is pier 17, isn't it?

13:29.443 --> 13:31.274
Seventeen's around
the other side.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.835
Oh, you're kidding.
Oh, my mistake.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.644
Listen, maybe if there's
a phone somewhere that I...

13:45.525 --> 13:46.992
It's a company car.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.889
Maybe you better
get out of here.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.020
Hey, I got a better idea.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.930
Maybe one of you guys could ride with
me down to the end of this dock...

13:52.999 --> 13:54.660
and give me directions.
What do you say?

13:54.735 --> 13:56.430
We gave you directions.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.798
Didn't you hear?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.136
Hey, come on, lighten up.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.677
All I want is my refrigerators.

14:04.745 --> 14:07.441
Big 22-cubic-footers
with ice makers?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.311
We got ice for you, pal.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.039
Jump.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.542
What?

14:16.656 --> 14:18.055
Jump.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.236
<i>Once, when I was a kid...</i>

14:31.304 --> 14:34.501

14:34.574 --> 14:36.974
<i>I held my own
until a fourth showed up.</i>

14:37.043 --> 14:40.342
<i>And from that day on, I vowed
that three was my limit.</i>

14:40.781 --> 14:43.978

know what I was fighting about.</i>

Beautiful young girls
in a chorus line?

15:22.003 --> 15:24.403
Since when did you believe
anything that Thomas said?

15:24.472 --> 15:28.135
I told you he was just trying to
con you into doing security for him.

15:28.209 --> 15:29.574
Well, this time it didn't work.

15:31.279 --> 15:32.871
♪ Three Little Maids

15:32.947 --> 15:35.074
All right, you can stop.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.717
Not entirely unacceptable.

15:43.024 --> 15:46.187
Now, Miss De Forest,
again from the chorus, please.

15:47.528 --> 15:49.860
Could I make a suggestion?
Yes.

15:50.365 --> 15:53.596
If I played it a tone lower, I think
it might be a little easier for them.

15:53.701 --> 15:55.601
Oh, can you do that?

15:55.937 --> 15:58.633
It would be heavenly not to.
- Oh, my God.

15:59.107 --> 16:02.668
You failed to mention that your
hot clue involved total immersion.

16:03.077 --> 16:07.036
Tell me that Mr. Masters' camera is not.
- The camera is fine!

16:11.986 --> 16:15.251
The only reason
that I'm a little bit wet...

16:15.623 --> 16:17.614
is I was conducting
a surveillance.

16:18.993 --> 16:20.551
Oh, Jonathan...

16:21.562 --> 16:23.223
it is 4:00.

16:25.533 --> 16:26.898
Very well.

16:27.735 --> 16:28.861
Tea.

16:33.174 --> 16:34.869
Did you see Eric?

16:35.076 --> 16:37.442
Well, how was he?
How does he look?

16:37.512 --> 16:41.039
Well, I didn't actually get to
talk to him. But he looks all right.

16:41.883 --> 16:43.316
Miss De Forest.

16:43.551 --> 16:44.882
I'll be right there.

16:45.286 --> 16:46.753
When do I get to see him?

16:46.988 --> 16:48.319
I'm working on it.

16:58.499 --> 17:00.399
Will you have some tea?

17:00.535 --> 17:02.696
Oh, thanks, Agatha.
Thanks, Agatha.

17:02.770 --> 17:05.739
All right, so they were a
little messy. Not a little messy.

17:05.807 --> 17:08.901
The last time that you and your
poker buddies used my place...

17:08.976 --> 17:12.275
it looked like someone set off a
claymore mine in the living room.

17:13.181 --> 17:16.241
Do you wanna explain this?
No. Rick, I'm glad you're here.

17:16.317 --> 17:19.252
Thomas, if this is about
security, I'm not doing it.

17:19.353 --> 17:21.513
Hey. What are these?
These are really great.

17:21.589 --> 17:24.580
Cucumber sandwiches. Oh, I
love vegetable sandwiches.

17:24.692 --> 17:26.751
Rick, I'm not going to ask you
about security.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.762
Thanks, Agatha.
You already turned me down.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.491
I respect that.
Good.

17:30.565 --> 17:33.227
I need you to run down an address
for me, from a license plate.

17:33.301 --> 17:35.292
Thomas, I just happen to be
a little busy right now.

17:35.369 --> 17:37.599
I'm trying to find a place for my
poker game by tomorrow afternoon.

17:37.672 --> 17:39.663
How long could it take you
to run down an address?

17:39.740 --> 17:42.868
I love cards.
They're so relaxing.

17:43.878 --> 17:45.038
One phone call.

17:45.113 --> 17:47.741
When my mother and father
went on their world cruise...

17:47.815 --> 17:50.147
they began playing cards
with another couple.

17:50.918 --> 17:52.545
From Australia, I believe.

17:53.254 --> 17:54.380
What do you say?

17:55.256 --> 17:57.053
Okay, okay.
Thanks.

17:57.391 --> 18:00.326
They started betting
a penny a point.

18:01.562 --> 18:02.756
High rollers, huh, Aggie?

18:02.830 --> 18:06.926
By the end of the cruise,
my father had lost $10,000.

18:07.401 --> 18:09.995
Ten? $10,000?
Yes.

18:10.071 --> 18:12.096
What did you
say they call this game?

18:12.173 --> 18:13.265
Bridge.

18:13.341 --> 18:15.138
Think you could
teach me how to play?

18:15.209 --> 18:17.268
I'd be delighted!

18:17.612 --> 18:18.874
Agatha.

18:20.681 --> 18:23.912
Well, as much as I'd hate
to miss the second chorus...

18:24.919 --> 18:27.945
You riding with me, buddy? Oh,
yeah. I've got things to do, too.

18:30.691 --> 18:33.091
See you later. I'll call
you later, too. Thanks.

18:34.962 --> 18:36.623
All right, ladies.

19:09.594 --> 19:10.856
Come in.

19:12.397 --> 19:13.989
Magnum, I've...

19:15.000 --> 19:17.525
Are you having trouble
with your lights? No!

19:19.805 --> 19:21.295
What do you want?

19:21.439 --> 19:23.407
I've just spoken to Sir Cedric.

19:23.508 --> 19:25.066
Apparently,
he's on the Island...

19:25.143 --> 19:27.839
although he's not arriving at
the estate until curtain time.

19:27.913 --> 19:29.312
Throw me that shirt, will you?

19:29.447 --> 19:32.939
And he's leaving
right after the performance...

19:33.018 --> 19:35.452
although he won't say
where he's going.

19:37.989 --> 19:40.253
It's not Robin's.
I bought it.

19:41.293 --> 19:42.590
Obviously.

19:42.661 --> 19:44.856
Higgins, could we
discuss this tomorrow?

19:44.930 --> 19:47.922
It's so typical of him to turn
everything into a cloak-and-dagger event.

19:47.999 --> 19:50.433
Even a simple production
of <i>The Mikado.</i>

19:50.802 --> 19:51.962
Hello.

19:54.940 --> 19:56.134
Hello.

19:57.843 --> 19:59.936
I hope I'm not early.

20:00.612 --> 20:01.806
No. No.

20:04.516 --> 20:06.347
Higgins was just leaving.

20:08.453 --> 20:09.750
Weren't you, Higgins?

20:10.488 --> 20:12.752
We'll discuss the schedule
tomorrow morning.

20:12.824 --> 20:14.257
First thing.

20:19.531 --> 20:21.362
Be sure the wine...

20:21.533 --> 20:23.125
has ample time...

20:23.268 --> 20:24.257
to breathe.

20:41.186 --> 20:43.313
You want some wine?
I'd love some.

20:43.388 --> 20:44.821
Why don't you sit down?

20:46.625 --> 20:50.391
Well, I'm not sure what I was
expecting, but this is nice. It's...

20:50.462 --> 20:52.225
friendly.
Lived in.

20:52.297 --> 20:53.764
Yeah.

20:55.133 --> 20:56.998
I hope you like Ahi Kupa.

20:57.202 --> 20:58.396
What's that?

20:58.503 --> 21:00.562
Oh, it's an old family recipe.

21:00.639 --> 21:02.163
Tuna casserole.

21:02.240 --> 21:03.264
Tuna casserole?

21:03.341 --> 21:04.330
Yeah.

21:04.643 --> 21:06.577
Do you know that
that is the only thing...

21:06.645 --> 21:08.408
that my mother knew how to cook?

21:08.480 --> 21:11.506
You're kidding. No. Well,
that and scrambled eggs.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.777
Well, we could order
out for some pizza. No.

21:15.420 --> 21:16.910
I love tuna casserole.

21:17.856 --> 21:20.347
Besides, I'm much too hungry
to wait for pizza.

21:20.425 --> 21:23.258
Well, that will be ready in
a few minutes. Okay, thanks.

21:23.395 --> 21:25.295
Oh, excuse me.

21:27.899 --> 21:30.367
When I was growing up,
my father was in the Navy.

21:30.702 --> 21:34.229
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. We moved around a lot.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.973
Every year or so, there I was,
the new kid in town.

21:38.310 --> 21:41.939
No matter where we were, there were
always two things that I could count on.

21:42.113 --> 21:45.549
One, that my brother, Eric,
was my best friend...

21:45.850 --> 21:48.819
number two, that my mother would
make tuna casserole for dinner.

21:49.788 --> 21:53.053
She used to try and disguise it
by calling it different names also.

21:53.124 --> 21:55.786
"Tuna Kim Chee"
when we were in Korea.

21:55.860 --> 21:57.088
Thomas.

21:59.998 --> 22:01.124
What?

22:01.232 --> 22:02.460
Whoa. Hey...

22:02.534 --> 22:05.731
I'm sorry I barged in on you
like this. Hi, Sally.

22:06.171 --> 22:07.433
I got that information for you.

22:07.505 --> 22:08.870
I thought you were gonna call.

22:08.940 --> 22:12.273
Well, I was. But I decided it'd better
if I just talked to you face to face.

22:12.344 --> 22:14.335
Is it about Eric?
Yeah.

22:14.879 --> 22:17.370
Here, I brought the
address over. Oh, great.

22:17.949 --> 22:20.713
But I figure, one favor
deserves another.

22:21.186 --> 22:23.450
About my poker game tomorrow afternoon.
- No.

22:23.521 --> 22:25.648
Now, wait a minute. You don't
even know what I'm gonna ask.

22:25.724 --> 22:27.715
You're going to ask if you can
have it here, and you can't...

22:27.792 --> 22:31.421
because the Sandwich Islands Savoyards
are performing <i>The Mikado</i> tomorrow.

22:31.496 --> 22:33.794
I know. Which means that
I'll be able to use the club.

22:33.865 --> 22:34.923
As long as you make sure...

22:35.000 --> 22:37.059
Higgins doesn't stop there
for anything. All right.

22:37.135 --> 22:40.195
Great! Hey, what is
this stuff, anyway?

22:40.672 --> 22:44.472
You know, it smells like something
my mother used to make. Tuna Noblidad.

23:11.636 --> 23:13.297
<i>People can be a little funny...</i>

23:13.371 --> 23:15.532
<i>about communal living
and unfamiliar lifestyles...</i>

23:15.607 --> 23:19.043
<i>so it's not unusual for a cult to
choose an out-of-the-way address.</i>

23:32.323 --> 23:34.416
<i>But the dragon symbol
of this order told me...</i>

23:34.492 --> 23:37.222
<i>these were not the types
who ask for money at airports.</i>

23:51.876 --> 23:54.936
<i>I didn't want to overreact by
charging in there, gun in hand...</i>

23:55.013 --> 23:58.073
<i>but, like my Uncle George
always said...</i>

23:58.149 --> 24:00.879
<i>"it's a good ide</i> a <i>to put
something awa</i> y <i>for a rainy day."</i>

24:27.745 --> 24:31.237
I'm a friend
of Sally's. Be quiet, okay?

24:36.621 --> 24:37.986
You're the guy from the dock.

24:38.056 --> 24:40.616
Sally is here.
She is worried about you.

24:40.792 --> 24:42.919
She all right?
She's fine.

24:43.561 --> 24:45.085
You shouldn't have come.

24:46.431 --> 24:48.023
What are you doing here?

24:49.200 --> 24:51.498
I can explain.
What is the meaning of this?

24:51.569 --> 24:53.628
Well, we were just leaving.
Come on, Eric.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.339
You want to leave
your friends, Eric?

24:59.010 --> 24:59.999
Oh, no.

25:00.445 --> 25:02.811
I am not going
in the water again.

25:05.216 --> 25:06.615
Come on, Eric!

25:20.113 --> 25:21.580
Two, no trump.

25:21.881 --> 25:24.076
Oh, hello,
Mr. Magnum. Three, clubs.

25:24.150 --> 25:25.344
Hello, Agatha.

25:25.685 --> 25:29.951
How's it going? Swimmingly.
I can't thank you enough.

25:30.289 --> 25:34.225
Rick told us how you offered to let
us use your place as a bridge parlor.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.924
Oh, he did? Three, hearts.

25:37.697 --> 25:38.994
Double.

25:39.499 --> 25:40.830
Redouble.

25:41.067 --> 25:44.400
Thomas, would you get me a beer
while you're up? Bid's to you, Aggie.

25:44.570 --> 25:46.731
Three hearts
doubled and redoubled.

25:46.906 --> 25:48.965
Oh, I pass. Indeed, I do.

25:49.642 --> 25:53.442
Well, I think I'll lead...

25:53.513 --> 25:56.744
the king of trumps...

25:56.816 --> 25:58.807
just to see what's what.

25:59.285 --> 26:00.912
We'll talk later.

26:04.457 --> 26:07.324
Rick, where are your hearts?
You have no trumps.

26:07.393 --> 26:10.692
Of course not. You're the one
that insisted on hearts, T.C.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.798
T.C., can I talk to you
for a minute?

26:13.132 --> 26:15.396
Yeah, sure. Here Sylvia,
would you play this, please?

26:15.468 --> 26:17.959
I hate to see a grown
man cry, especially me.

26:21.407 --> 26:24.103
You remember that quarterback
on your Pop Warner team?

26:24.177 --> 26:25.974
Albert.
What was his name?

26:27.213 --> 26:28.407
Charlie, Albert Charlie.

26:28.481 --> 26:30.506
Yeah. Well,
take a look at this.

26:31.918 --> 26:34.216
This guy took
a shot at me last night.

26:35.655 --> 26:38.055
Hidden Dragon? Man,
where'd these come from?

26:38.391 --> 26:40.916
I saw a wall hanging
of the dragon last night...

26:40.993 --> 26:43.223
and it looked familiar,
but I couldn't quite place it.

26:43.296 --> 26:44.923
And then this morning,
I remembered Albert.

26:44.997 --> 26:47.898
So, I went and developed these
pictures I took on the docks.

26:47.967 --> 26:50.458
Man, The Hidden Dragon. I thought
that group was dead. So did I!

26:50.536 --> 26:52.527
What are you guys talking
about? What Hidden Dragon?

26:52.605 --> 26:54.232
It's a long story.

26:54.307 --> 26:56.275
What are they doing
back on the island?

26:57.176 --> 26:58.803
What about this dragon?

26:59.078 --> 27:01.410
Look, you know
about Hong Kong...

27:01.480 --> 27:03.710
the new territories,
China and Britain?

27:03.783 --> 27:05.341
Yeah, their lease
is almost up. So?

27:05.418 --> 27:08.717
Yeah, well, they were having these
talks, and this radical political group-

27:08.788 --> 27:10.255
Yeah, the Hidden Dragon. Yeah.

27:10.356 --> 27:12.551
They tried to disrupt the
talks. They want Britain out.

27:12.925 --> 27:15.155
What are they doing
back in Honolulu?

27:16.495 --> 27:17.484
Unless...

27:18.297 --> 27:19.355
Unless there's more talks.

27:22.902 --> 27:23.994
Yeah?

27:25.004 --> 27:25.993
Well-

27:26.272 --> 27:27.899
Yeah. Hold on a minute.

27:28.274 --> 27:29.605
Yep-
Huh?

27:29.675 --> 27:30.801
Give me that.

27:30.910 --> 27:31.899
Hello.

27:32.245 --> 27:34.270
Thomas, something wonderful
has happened.

27:34.347 --> 27:36.508
Eric just called
and he's ready to meet us.

27:42.989 --> 27:45.753
Magnum, have
you seen Agatha and Bernice?

27:46.626 --> 27:47.650
No.

27:47.727 --> 27:49.718
I've been waiting to go over
the schedule with you.

27:49.795 --> 27:52.696
I'm expecting the guests and Sir
Cedric to arrive at approximately-

27:52.765 --> 27:54.699
I'm sorry. I'll have to talk
to you when I get back.

27:54.767 --> 27:56.428
Where in blazes are you going?

27:56.502 --> 27:58.800
This is unbelievably
irresponsible, even for you-

27:58.871 --> 28:01.339
Higgins - Magnum, let me
explain something to you.

28:01.407 --> 28:04.706
I directed Sir Cedric Brooke in <i>The
Mikado</i> when we were schoolboys at Eton.

28:04.777 --> 28:05.835
Wait a minute. Sir Cedric-

28:05.911 --> 28:08.903
I directed him in <i>The Mikado</i> when we
were under the same command in Burma.

28:08.981 --> 28:11.313
His lifelong study of
oriental society and custom...

28:11.384 --> 28:13.147
made his interpretation
of the role-

28:13.219 --> 28:15.585
Is Sir Cedric with
the British Diplomatic Corps?

28:16.155 --> 28:18.817
Good heavens, no. Cedric?

28:19.292 --> 28:21.886
The man has all the tact
of a charging rhinoceros.

28:22.061 --> 28:23.289
That does not alter the fact...

28:23.362 --> 28:27.162
that he called and personally asked me to
put together this production of <i>The Mikado.</i>

28:27.233 --> 28:28.894
If he arrives and finds
either the production...

28:28.968 --> 28:32.597
or my security measures lacking,
I shall be personally humiliated.

28:32.672 --> 28:35.505
I'll be back. Security
will be impeccable.

28:35.574 --> 28:38.270
And as for the show,
what could possibly compete...

28:38.344 --> 28:40.642
with a Jonathan Quayle Higgins
production?

28:41.580 --> 28:43.104
What does Sir Cedric do?

28:43.949 --> 28:45.314
He's retired.

28:58.664 --> 28:59.756
<i>Ever wonder why...</i>

28:59.832 --> 29:02.596
<i>there's no retirement home
for private investigators?</i>

29:02.668 --> 29:04.636
<i>I have. Often.</i>

29:04.804 --> 29:09.207
<i>And my reaction is that it always pays
to be smarter than the other guy.</i>

29:09.275 --> 29:12.472
<i>Especially when the other guy
may be waiting to do you in.</i>

29:13.112 --> 29:15.546
<i>I was beginning to see things
that didn't add up.</i>

29:15.681 --> 29:18.616
<i>A newspaper ad left
conveniently where I'd find it.</i>

29:18.684 --> 29:21.676
<i>Guys shooting at me
at close range and missing.</i>

29:21.754 --> 29:26.555
<i>Now, maybe Eric was waiting for me at
the remote location he'd given Sally.</i>

29:29.628 --> 29:32.153
<i>And then again, maybe he wasn't.</i>

29:39.438 --> 29:40.837
<i>I had a growing suspicion...</i>

29:40.906 --> 29:44.205
<i>that Eric hadn't joined the
Hidden Dragon to learn chanting.</i>

29:44.276 --> 29:47.712
<i>When he left the commune
alone, my suspicion was confirmed.</i>

29:47.780 --> 29:50.442
<i>Unless that was a guitar
in the rifle case.</i>

29:55.387 --> 29:59.483
<i>But I couldn't convince myself he
was on his way to a jam session.</i>

30:01.627 --> 30:05.893
<i>And something T.C. said kept nagging
at me. Were there more talks?</i>

30:05.965 --> 30:09.560
<i>And if not, why would a retired
expert on China like Sir Cedric...</i>

30:09.635 --> 30:12.695
<i>choose this particular time
to come to Honolulu...</i>

30:12.771 --> 30:15.001
<i>to star in a production of</i>
The Mikado?

30:17.409 --> 30:18.467
Aha!

30:18.544 --> 30:20.512
The miscreants exposed!

30:20.579 --> 30:23.548
This is shocking behavior
from members of my troupe.

30:23.749 --> 30:26.650
Jonathan, I think you're
overreacting a bit.

30:26.719 --> 30:28.619
You will return
to rehearsal at once.

30:28.687 --> 30:31.247
Now wait a minute, Higgins. You
can't break this game up now.

30:31.323 --> 30:32.722
T.C. and I are behind.

30:33.225 --> 30:34.852
$1,200.

30:36.595 --> 30:38.187
$1,200?

30:38.530 --> 30:41.465
Gambling? You've been
down here gambling?

30:41.800 --> 30:45.361
Agatha, this is more than
just gross dereliction of duty.

30:45.437 --> 30:47.905
Do you know,
by the last rubber...

30:48.173 --> 30:51.836
it will be closer to $1,500.

30:52.478 --> 30:54.571
$1,500?

30:54.713 --> 30:57.773
Just relax. We'll make it up
later, you know what I mean?

30:57.850 --> 30:59.784
I am simply appalled
that you could behave...

30:59.852 --> 31:02.412
in such an unprofessional,
irresponsible manner.

31:02.488 --> 31:06.151
Your duty is to remain close to the
stage at all times in case I need you.

31:06.225 --> 31:07.886
Oh, good heavens.

31:08.527 --> 31:13.021
We're getting so tired
of your bombastic manner.

31:13.666 --> 31:15.600
Bombastic?
Yes.

31:16.168 --> 31:21.105
You pick on us at all the
rehearsals. Nothing we do is right.

31:21.707 --> 31:24.005
Madam, you are
on shaky ground already.

31:24.076 --> 31:27.637
Don't throw your marginal
musical manipulation in as well.

31:27.713 --> 31:30.443
Well, you're only doing
half <i>The Mikado.</i>

31:30.916 --> 31:35.250
I've never seen
such eccentric staging.

31:35.854 --> 31:38.721
Eccentric?
You tell him, Bernice.

31:39.224 --> 31:43.923
I'm quitting and you're quitting
with me, Agatha, aren't you?

31:44.697 --> 31:45.857
Well...

31:46.465 --> 31:50.424
Well, Jonathan, you have perhaps
been a touch too forceful...

31:50.502 --> 31:53.198
with your criticisms.
Ridiculous.

31:53.572 --> 31:55.096
"Ridiculous"!

31:55.407 --> 31:59.810
If we're ridiculous, Agatha,
we're not needed around here.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.606
Agatha, I forbid you to go.

32:07.252 --> 32:10.585
Nobody forbids me
to do anything.

32:17.596 --> 32:19.723
You'll come back. Crawling.

32:21.166 --> 32:24.294
Nobody quits the Sandwich
Islands Savoyards.

32:24.403 --> 32:26.803
They only leave
when I fire them.

32:57.836 --> 33:00.134
Gentlemen, I
think that will be all for today.

33:00.205 --> 33:01.263
Thank you.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.808
Thank you, Sir
Cedric. We're most grateful.

33:37.976 --> 33:39.000
Thank you.

35:00.957 --> 35:02.219
If it's a matter of billing...

35:02.292 --> 35:04.351
I am afraid the programs
have already been printed.

35:04.427 --> 35:06.588
Oh, Jonathan, it's not the
billing, or the money...

35:06.663 --> 35:07.891
or a larger role.

35:07.964 --> 35:10.762
Then what in blazes is it?
I've never seen you like this.

35:10.834 --> 35:13.132
It's Bernice, isn't it?
She's got you all fired up.

35:13.203 --> 35:15.467
It has nothing to do
with Bernice.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.331
It's you, Jonathan.

35:17.741 --> 35:21.734
I thought we were putting on a
show, not some military campaign.

35:22.345 --> 35:26.281
We should be having fun. But
you've been behaving like some...

35:26.750 --> 35:31.187
I'm sorry, Jonathan, like some
overbearing commanding officer.

35:31.321 --> 35:34.154
Nonsense. I was merely trying.
- Yes, you have.

35:34.257 --> 35:37.852
Like some overanxious nanny
with her first charge.

35:52.075 --> 35:53.906
You're quite right, of course.

35:55.078 --> 35:58.878
I'm sorry to say that ever since Sir
Cedric and I were in short pants...

35:59.649 --> 36:01.776
long before he was Sir Cedric...

36:02.319 --> 36:06.119
we have inspired in each other this
unflattering competitive streak.

36:07.324 --> 36:11.420
As a matter of fact, I had even secretly
begun to wish that he wouldn't show up...

36:11.494 --> 36:13.587
so that I might take his place.

36:14.998 --> 36:19.458
I've always fancied I would make a far
better Lord High Executioner than he.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.439
Dare I hope that you will
find it in your heart...

36:24.574 --> 36:26.735
to forgive my
churlish behavior...

36:27.610 --> 36:30.738
and return with me to the estate
for this afternoon's performance?

36:34.150 --> 36:35.447
<i>When I was in Little League...</i>

36:35.518 --> 36:37.850
<i>I got smashed in the head
with a baseball bat.</i>

36:38.088 --> 36:39.783
<i>The only difference
between then and now...</i>

36:39.856 --> 36:42.825
<i>was that Eric swung a lot
harder than a 10-year-old.</i>

36:42.959 --> 36:47.328
<i>I was dizzy, disoriented, and my legs
felt as heavy as concrete pillars.</i>

36:48.465 --> 36:51.491
<i>But the worst feeling, was
knowing I had to face Sally...</i>

36:51.568 --> 36:53.433
<i>and tell her
her brother was dead.</i>

36:53.970 --> 36:57.497
<i>That I'd been forced to kill him, was
going to make even less sense to her.</i>

36:57.874 --> 37:01.571
<i>But then, things weren't making
a lot of sense to me, either.</i>

37:05.181 --> 37:06.273
Wait!

37:06.616 --> 37:08.015
<i>She wouldn't listen.</i>

37:10.687 --> 37:12.120
I am doomed.

37:12.389 --> 37:13.788
They're not coming back?

37:14.691 --> 37:18.855
Why today, of all days, has Agatha
chosen to demonstrate her resolve?

37:19.295 --> 37:21.729
Weeks of backbreaking rehearsal.

37:22.165 --> 37:25.862
All my personal prestige on the line,
along with my reputation as an artist.

37:25.935 --> 37:28.460
The entire British colony
here today...

37:28.538 --> 37:31.371
not to mention, a guest star
of international renown.

37:31.441 --> 37:35.343
And what befalls me?
Ruin. Humiliation.

37:36.246 --> 37:37.804
Disaster.

37:38.114 --> 37:39.741
Well, it could be worse.

37:40.884 --> 37:44.445
I mean, just get two more girls.
That routine isn't that hard to learn.

37:44.521 --> 37:48.321
That routine has at least 97 different
motions, intonations, and gestures.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.189
Don't forget the dance
steps. It's simply impossible.

37:51.294 --> 37:54.752
Come on Higgins. Listen, T.C.
and I learned all that stuff.

37:55.498 --> 37:56.988
Well, we did.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.394
Listen, every time one of
those girls was dummy...

37:59.469 --> 38:01.903
she was up and around that
room, dancing and singing.

38:01.971 --> 38:05.429
Yeah. At first I thought it
was some kind of secret signal.

38:05.508 --> 38:08.636
They were very dedicated
to you, Jonathan.

38:09.412 --> 38:13.405
You're the loyal one, Sylvia. You
didn't quit. You stuck with me.

38:14.050 --> 38:17.076
Well, I think you've been
a terrible bully, too...

38:17.153 --> 38:20.919
but I've worked and waited all my
life to sing and dance in this show.

38:20.990 --> 38:25.086
Higgins, look, you're not listening.
It's a snap. I'm telling you!

38:25.495 --> 38:26.757
T.C., come on.

38:28.331 --> 38:29.662
All right.

38:37.707 --> 38:40.574
Here we go. Feet
together. Legs together.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.969
Five, six, seven, eight.

38:43.213 --> 38:45.579
♪ Three
Little Maids from school are we ♪

38:45.648 --> 38:48.116
♪ Pert as a schoolgirl
well can be ♪

38:48.184 --> 38:51.381
♪ Filled to the brim
with girlish glee ♪

38:51.488 --> 38:54.457
♪ Three Little Maids
from school ♪

38:55.925 --> 38:58.052
My God. I don't believe it.

38:59.095 --> 39:00.926
Could you possibly
do that one more time?

39:00.997 --> 39:04.262
Oh, you're not thinking of
putting these two in the-

39:04.334 --> 39:06.598
And this time, a little more
coquettish with the eyes.

39:06.669 --> 39:10.537
Oh, if you're doing what I
think you're gonna do, I'll quit.

39:10.607 --> 39:12.973
I'm warning you.
What is she going on about?

39:13.042 --> 39:14.873
Nothing. Ignore her.
Concentrate.

39:15.545 --> 39:19.413
Oh, you're doing it!
And I quit!

39:19.482 --> 39:20.744
Hey, Sylvia, wait a minute.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.409
He's not serious.
We're only joking with you.

39:22.485 --> 39:25.477
She'll be back. She said herself she's
been waiting all of her life for this.

39:25.555 --> 39:27.455
Now, about your costumes.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.893
Higgins, I got a very
important engagement.

39:32.195 --> 39:33.924
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, hey,
You can forget it.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.259
No way the kid
gonna look ridiculous.

39:36.266 --> 39:38.063
Of course, not.
Yeah.

39:38.434 --> 39:39.958
Certainly not.

39:40.069 --> 39:43.732
However, it does occur to me that your
half of that sordid gambling debt...

39:43.806 --> 39:46.604
must be equal to the monthly
payment for your helicopter.

39:47.243 --> 39:50.110
And as for you, Rick, I'm sure the
Board of Directors of the club...

39:50.180 --> 39:53.980
would want to seriously reconsider
the employment of a known gambler.

39:54.918 --> 39:59.116
Now, of course, if both of you were
to volunteer to be in the show...

39:59.189 --> 40:02.181
I might possibly be able to use my
influence with both the ladies...

40:02.258 --> 40:03.885
and the Board of Directors.

40:04.160 --> 40:07.391
The decision, naturally,
is up to you.

40:08.398 --> 40:10.923
You wouldn't.
Oh, yes, I would.

40:21.578 --> 40:24.012
<i>The more I walked, the
more I put the pieces together.</i>

40:24.080 --> 40:26.446
<i>How would Eric have known
where to call Sally?</i>

40:26.716 --> 40:28.411
<i>And who had led me
step by step...</i>

40:28.484 --> 40:31.180
<i>to the clues that had lured me
away from the estate...</i>

40:31.421 --> 40:33.548
<i>and from the assassination plot?</i>

40:33.856 --> 40:35.050
<i>Sally.</i>

40:35.391 --> 40:38.485
<i>The beauty with the innocent
eyes and the heartbreak smile...</i>

40:38.561 --> 40:39.687
<i>had set me up.</i>

40:40.430 --> 40:43.695
<i>And even though Eric had failed,
I realized he was only plan A.</i>

40:44.100 --> 40:45.897
<i>If I didn't find a way
to get home soon...</i>

40:45.969 --> 40:49.166
<i>the Lord High Executioner
was gonna be executed himself.</i>

40:50.039 --> 40:51.597
The other foot, Rick.

40:52.842 --> 40:55.208
T.C.,
I can't do it alone.

40:55.278 --> 40:57.906
You got to be in the show. I mean,
think of Gilbert and Sullivan.

40:57.981 --> 40:59.642
Think of the money.
I have.

40:59.716 --> 41:02.082
I made a deal with Higgins
to cover security for Magnum.

41:02.151 --> 41:04.278
And that will take care
of my part of the debt.

41:04.354 --> 41:06.151
Goodbye.
That's just great.

41:06.623 --> 41:10.457
Rick, you're not even dressed yet.
Higgins has already called half-hour.

41:10.526 --> 41:12.994
Look, Sally. I can't do it.
I can't remember the words...

41:13.062 --> 41:14.427
I can't remember
the motivation...

41:14.497 --> 41:16.260
and I can't-I can't
look coquettish.

41:16.332 --> 41:19.324
Yes, you can. Sit down, and
I'll help you finish your makeup.

41:19.402 --> 41:21.734
Quickly, please. I'm calling
everyone into the study.

41:21.804 --> 41:23.169
Sir Cedric is here.

41:27.543 --> 41:28.669
Dumb.

41:48.231 --> 41:52.531
It is an honor to welcome to
the Sandwich Islands Savoyards...

41:52.902 --> 41:55.166
our very special guest star...

41:55.605 --> 41:58.802
whose generosity in coming
today to lend his support...

41:58.875 --> 42:01.105
to our endeavor is legend.

42:02.578 --> 42:03.977
Sir Cedric Brooke.

42:06.582 --> 42:07.810
Thank you all very much.

42:07.884 --> 42:11.547
It's a pleasure to see the
spirit of Gilbert and Sullivan...

42:11.621 --> 42:13.646
flourish so far from home.

42:14.590 --> 42:18.026
I'm sure today's performance
will indeed be most memorable.

42:18.461 --> 42:19.826
Thank you again.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.760
All right, everybody.
20 minutes to curtain.

42:28.204 --> 42:32.140
Sally, we can't do this alone. Now, who
is going to play the third little maid?

42:32.208 --> 42:35.268
If Sylvia doesn't come back,
then we'll just do it without her.

42:35.545 --> 42:37.137
The show must go on.

42:37.947 --> 42:39.209
Higgins.

42:39.415 --> 42:41.315
Higgins, this is your
last chance to reconsider.

42:41.384 --> 42:43.045
You got to cut the
<i>Three Little Maids</i> number.

42:43.119 --> 42:45.087
We can't just do it
with the two of us.

42:45.355 --> 42:46.913
You won't have to.

42:47.990 --> 42:49.218
Agatha.

42:51.928 --> 42:55.489
I'm afraid I wasn't able to
convince Bernice and Sylvia.

42:56.432 --> 42:59.128
But your apology was
certainly good enough for me.

42:59.936 --> 43:02.564
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks a lot.

Higgins?

45:37.493 --> 45:39.518
Well, what have
you got to say for yourself?

45:39.595 --> 45:41.062
And this had better be good.

45:41.130 --> 45:43.223
No. You.

45:43.533 --> 45:45.501
You have got
some explaining to do.

45:45.568 --> 45:48.969
I almost got killed
chasing down some lunatic...

45:49.038 --> 45:50.403
who was after your friend.

45:50.473 --> 45:53.408
If you had been attending to
security, as I asked you to do...

45:53.476 --> 45:54.738
you would have
uncovered the plot...

45:54.810 --> 45:57.574
before it got to some ridiculous
cliffside confrontation.

45:57.647 --> 46:01.344
If you had told me why Sir Cedric was
here, I could have handled security.

46:01.417 --> 46:03.647
I don't appreciate being
left in the dark, Higgins.

46:03.719 --> 46:06.779
How in blazes was I supposed to tell
you something I didn't know myself?

46:06.856 --> 46:08.153
You should have
suspected the truth...

46:08.224 --> 46:10.454
when that girl approached you in
the first place... Wait a minute.

46:10.526 --> 46:13.689
With that preposterous story
about... Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

46:14.297 --> 46:16.925
Sir Cedric, your good friend...

46:17.533 --> 46:21.867
who's been through several wars with
you, did not tell you why he was here?

46:23.406 --> 46:24.430
No.

46:25.942 --> 46:27.705
Doesn't that make you mad?

46:28.444 --> 46:29.706
Furious.

46:34.050 --> 46:36.678
What?
It's nothing. Just...

46:37.887 --> 46:41.084
I'm upset with Sally
because she lied to me.

46:41.157 --> 46:43.489
And you're upset with Sir
Cedric because he lied to you.

46:43.559 --> 46:45.823
And here we are,
taking it out on each other.

46:48.831 --> 46:50.025
Yes.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.290
I see what you mean.

46:52.902 --> 46:53.926
Higgins!

46:55.972 --> 46:57.906
Hi, Thomas.
Hi, Rick.

46:57.974 --> 47:00.909
Higgins, I've been giving
next year's show...

47:00.977 --> 47:03.207
Well, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

47:03.846 --> 47:05.473
Next year's show?
Mmm-hmm.

47:05.815 --> 47:07.874
You know,
I got to admit, at first...

47:07.950 --> 47:10.441
just the thought of me doing
some stupid musical, well...

47:10.519 --> 47:12.646
it really wasn't something
I wanted to do.

47:12.722 --> 47:14.986
But then, after today's
performance, well...

47:16.025 --> 47:17.014
Well, here.

47:21.364 --> 47:23.161

47:23.833 --> 47:27.030
Yeah, don't you see? The
Pirate King. I'm perfect!

47:27.236 --> 47:30.865
Come on, I'll show you. I
assure you, that's not necessary.

47:30.940 --> 47:33.465
