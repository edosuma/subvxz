00:01.713 --> 00:04.839
In May of 2007,
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married

00:04.939 --> 00:08.253
at the historic Van Smoot
House in upstate New York.

00:09.105 --> 00:11.691
Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.

00:12.059 --> 00:15.084
Yeah. It's just how
I always pictured it.

00:15.184 --> 00:17.023
Well, that was a load of crap.

00:17.276 --> 00:19.907
You see, kids, when you get married,
you learn a hard lesson.

00:20.007 --> 00:23.228
The wedding you set out to have is
almost never the wedding you end up with.

00:23.328 --> 00:26.564
So, we've decided on a small,
outdoor wedding,

00:26.664 --> 00:28.852
just family and close friends.

00:28.954 --> 00:30.708
No more than 25 people

00:30.812 --> 00:33.098
in a beautiful
garden somewhere,

00:33.198 --> 00:35.349
maybe an acoustic
guitar playing

00:35.450 --> 00:37.083
while we walk down the aisle.

00:37.187 --> 00:39.820
And maybe you already know someone
who went down to the courthouse

00:39.854 --> 00:41.589
and registered as an officiant

00:41.694 --> 00:43.588
so that he or she-- he--

00:43.696 --> 00:45.229
could perform the ceremony.

00:45.336 --> 00:48.199
But you hate marriage.
Why do you want to perform the ceremony?

00:48.303 --> 00:51.640
Because it subtly implants in
the mind of every woman there

00:51.745 --> 00:53.029
that when I ask a question,

00:53.133 --> 00:54.609
you say, "I do."

00:55.833 --> 00:56.829
Yeah.

00:57.804 --> 00:59.210
The closer you get
to the big day,

00:59.313 --> 01:00.541
the more concessions you make.

01:00.646 --> 01:03.860
Great. Now my mom's making
me invite the Lessners.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.991
This puts our numbers
in the triple digits.

01:07.095 --> 01:12.018
Wow. I guess sometimes,
Lessner is more... ner.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.611
You know how like
sometimes less is more.

01:14.716 --> 01:16.848
Yeah. This is one of
those times, sweetie?

01:17.854 --> 01:21.290
You know what? That's okay.
It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.

01:21.396 --> 01:24.479
So it's not going to be an
outdoor wedding anymore.

01:24.584 --> 01:28.509
Marshall's dad is convinced if we
have an outdoor wedding in New York,

01:28.614 --> 01:32.129
he's going to get mugged,
so it's going to be inside now.

01:32.655 --> 01:36.791
It'll be great. We're still going
to have our acoustic guitar player.

01:36.894 --> 01:39.598
So now,
instead of an acoustic guitar,

01:39.704 --> 01:41.451
we're having a harp player.

01:41.783 --> 01:45.559
Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and...
that guy's daughter plays the harp.

01:45.683 --> 01:49.359
Is she hot? I'd love to be able to
cross "harp player" off my list.

01:49.733 --> 01:51.391
How long is this list?

01:51.495 --> 01:54.630
Dude, I'm not gonna count
how many pages the list is.

01:54.733 --> 01:56.098
I'm not crass.

01:56.286 --> 01:58.889
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
She's pregnant.

01:58.993 --> 02:01.070
Sweet! I can cross
off two things.

And the day arrives for Lily and
Marshall's very big indoor wedding...

02:20.815 --> 02:21.901
with a harp.

02:22.004 --> 02:23.120
Hi, Lily.

02:23.246 --> 02:24.990
Wow. Andrea.

02:25.095 --> 02:26.531
You really are pregnant.

02:26.637 --> 02:27.352
Yeah.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.859
How do you play the harp
with your belly so...?

02:29.966 --> 02:32.712
Oh, I don't really--
I can only reach about half the strings.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.962
You only play half the harp?

02:35.066 --> 02:36.132
Yeah.

02:36.556 --> 02:39.281
Oh, no. Uh, okay.
Lily, I will take care of this.

02:39.387 --> 02:42.029
Um, I'll just pluck the other half.
Is it hard to learn?

02:42.137 --> 02:44.149
I've been studying
the harp for 12 years.

02:44.255 --> 02:46.011
Yeah, but I'm a fast learner.

02:46.115 --> 02:48.621
You ever hear of "Guitar Hero"?
Learned that in a day.

02:48.726 --> 02:49.970
Is there a "Harp Hero"?

02:50.074 --> 02:51.439
Robin, it's fine.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.620
So, so, when are you due?

02:53.727 --> 02:54.541
Tuesday.

02:54.646 --> 02:55.852
Wow, that's soon.

02:55.954 --> 02:57.280
Last Tuesday.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.490
Holy crap, we have to fire her.

03:00.594 --> 03:03.421
She's gonna drop a shorty in
the middle of your ceremony.

03:03.524 --> 03:06.442
Robin, I'm not going
to freak myself out.

03:06.545 --> 03:07.979
I hate those women who say,

03:08.087 --> 03:10.391
"Oh, my wedding
has to be perfect."

03:10.494 --> 03:14.279
Things go wrong. Sometimes the
deejay screws up your playlist.

03:14.386 --> 03:18.032
Sometimes you slip on placenta
during the recessional.

03:19.095 --> 03:20.589
Can I grab a scotch
and soda real quick?

03:20.625 --> 03:24.131
No. I'm not allowed to serve
anything until the reception.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.701
Wow. You just cost
yourself a big tip, buddy.

03:26.806 --> 03:29.281
I'm not allowed to
accept tips, buddy.

03:29.854 --> 03:31.700
You allowed to
accept criticism?

03:31.807 --> 03:34.922
You, sir, are an ass... buddy.

03:36.537 --> 03:39.409
Hey, you want to know what line
doesn't work on a harp player?

03:39.517 --> 03:41.432
"Hey, baby, want to pluck?"

03:41.774 --> 03:43.410
Really? That didn't work.

03:43.515 --> 03:44.790
Not even a little.

03:46.115 --> 03:48.112
Hey! Who's Bill?

03:48.217 --> 03:49.020
Bill?

03:49.127 --> 03:51.792
Yeah. This guy came
up to me at the bar.

03:52.005 --> 03:53.559
Can I ask you something?

03:53.664 --> 03:57.939
Where in the ceremony is the place
where they ask if anyone objects?

03:58.407 --> 04:00.982
Uh... Don't think
they do that anymore.

04:01.085 --> 04:03.902
Oh, so when do you think
someone should do it?

04:04.006 --> 04:06.949
Just wait for a lull or what?

04:07.776 --> 04:09.051
Oh, no.

04:09.157 --> 04:13.309
Did he look like a guy who tried
to be an umpire but failed?

04:14.185 --> 04:15.671
He kind of did.

04:15.775 --> 04:17.011
That's Scooter.

04:17.113 --> 04:19.509
Your high school
boyfriend, Scooter?

04:19.613 --> 04:21.142
His real name is Bill.

04:21.245 --> 04:22.780
My mom must have invited him.

04:22.885 --> 04:24.290
Why? Why would she do that?

04:24.396 --> 04:26.059
Our families are really close.

04:26.164 --> 04:27.490
But my ex-boyfriend?

04:27.595 --> 04:28.831
Come on, Mom.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.809
I didn't invite that professional
squash player Dad busted you with.

04:33.295 --> 04:35.081
Oh, I need a glass of wine.

04:35.184 --> 04:35.969
I'll get it.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.061
Oh, thanks.
Hey, how's Marshall doing?

04:38.167 --> 04:38.759
He's great.

04:38.786 --> 04:40.020
He's about to get his hair cut.

04:40.115 --> 04:42.960
Oh. I'm worried my cousin's
going to cut it too short.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.711
Me, too. I was up all night.

04:46.636 --> 04:47.722
Hello, Lily.

04:47.825 --> 04:48.531
Hey, Bill.

04:48.637 --> 04:49.611
Hey, Barney.

04:49.716 --> 04:52.071
Scooter, what are
you doing here?

04:52.176 --> 04:53.890
It's not "Scooter" anymore.

04:53.997 --> 04:55.340
It's Bill.

04:55.487 --> 04:57.921
A lot of things have
changed about me, Lily,

04:58.024 --> 04:59.271
but one hasn't.

04:59.374 --> 05:00.991
I still love you.

05:01.145 --> 05:03.322
And I came here
to win you back.

05:04.265 --> 05:07.001
You're really cute.
Oh, no. Really?

05:07.107 --> 05:09.210
Lily, I-I know it's crazy,

05:09.574 --> 05:11.130
but I love you,

05:11.454 --> 05:13.491
and if you can
look me in the eye

05:13.595 --> 05:15.349
and tell me that you
want to marry Marshall,

05:15.354 --> 05:18.390
I will leave right now and
be out of your life forever.

05:18.495 --> 05:19.720
I want...

05:21.995 --> 05:23.119
I want...

05:24.207 --> 05:25.299
Scooter!

05:25.585 --> 05:26.642
I need a glass of wine.

05:26.745 --> 05:28.769
And I need you to
get out of my face.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.312
It's for the bride, so...

05:30.416 --> 05:31.682
White or red?

05:31.786 --> 05:32.922
White.

05:33.897 --> 05:36.751
And, uh...
she'd also like a scotch and soda.

05:36.855 --> 05:37.471
You got it.

05:37.576 --> 05:40.019
She'd also like a bowl
of smoked almonds.

05:40.126 --> 05:41.191
I don't have any,

05:41.294 --> 05:43.579
but I guess I could run out
to the corner and get some.

05:43.684 --> 05:46.391
Well, it's only the biggest
day of her life, so...

05:49.797 --> 05:51.961
Let the games begin.

05:53.504 --> 05:55.679
Here. Can't stay.
Got to try something.

05:56.453 --> 05:58.649
Maybe my words won't
change your mind,

05:58.749 --> 06:01.350
but maybe the words
of a poet will.

06:01.871 --> 06:05.584
I read from "November Rain."

06:05.928 --> 06:07.702
By W. Axl Rose.

06:07.807 --> 06:09.389
That is a good song.

06:10.045 --> 06:12.609
Barney said you needed me to
bounce some guy named Scooter?

06:15.525 --> 06:16.450
What's up with Bill?

06:16.555 --> 06:17.599
That's Scooter.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.420
I'm on it.

06:22.956 --> 06:24.721
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:25.296 --> 06:26.872
Can I have your phone number?

06:26.974 --> 06:28.211
No.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.269
It's for the bride.

06:30.726 --> 06:32.991
Oh. Hold on.
Let me go get a pen.

06:35.245 --> 06:37.399
The bride wants
you to walk slower.

06:40.325 --> 06:42.030
Oh, wow.

06:42.134 --> 06:44.462
Oh. Robin...

06:44.565 --> 06:46.352
My makeup looks
perfect right now,

06:46.457 --> 06:48.990
and I'm about to cry.
Do something.

06:50.437 --> 06:51.932
I have hairy nipples.

06:52.036 --> 06:52.779
Really?

06:52.887 --> 06:54.552
No, but it worked, didn't it?

06:55.037 --> 06:56.702
Hey. Funny story.

06:56.805 --> 06:58.481
I tackled this guy I
thought was Scooter.

06:58.587 --> 07:00.110
Turns out it was
your photographer.

07:00.216 --> 07:03.579
Don't worry. I got this sweet
camera phone, so we're covered.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.231
There's a photographer?

07:06.335 --> 07:07.302
Oh, my God.

07:07.406 --> 07:09.819
- Okay, I just have to call...
- Robin, stop. Stop.

07:09.924 --> 07:11.131
It's okay.

07:11.236 --> 07:14.512
I am not gonna let
anything get to me today.

07:15.066 --> 07:17.370
I just got a call from the florist.
The flowers won't be here

07:17.404 --> 07:19.131
till halfway through
the ceremony.

07:21.605 --> 07:22.852
I'm okay.

07:22.954 --> 07:26.740
I hate to bother you, but... I think
I found your veil in the parking lot.

07:27.544 --> 07:28.822
I'm fine.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.429
Just FYI: my water broke.

07:32.536 --> 07:33.912
But I can probably...

07:38.546 --> 07:39.802
...make it through.

07:40.086 --> 07:41.310
Totally cool.

07:43.705 --> 07:44.841
Oh, no.

07:45.846 --> 07:48.291
Lily, I think I forgot
your bridal panties.

07:48.397 --> 07:50.321
I-I thought I had them.
I'm so sorry.

07:50.424 --> 07:52.470
Oh, it's okay,
I'll just wear the ones I have on.

07:52.577 --> 07:53.579
Are you sure?

07:53.685 --> 07:55.700
I'm marrying Marshall today.

07:55.804 --> 07:58.709
So it doesn't even matter that
I'm gonna walk down the aisle

07:58.815 --> 08:02.180
without a veil in a room
that has no flowers

08:02.287 --> 08:05.830
to the music of half a harp
played by a woman who's crowning,

08:05.934 --> 08:09.272
as my high school boyfriend
reads Guns N' Roses lyrics.

08:09.376 --> 08:10.442
But that's okay,

08:10.544 --> 08:14.000
because there's no photographer there
to take any pictures of it anyway.

08:15.507 --> 08:16.910
Lily, are you okay?

08:17.017 --> 08:19.310
What do you think?!
Of course I'm not okay!

08:19.415 --> 08:22.749
Everything that could possibly
go wrong at my wedding has!

08:22.856 --> 08:23.992
It's ruined!

08:24.095 --> 08:25.980
What happened to "I don't
want a perfect wedding"?

08:26.016 --> 08:29.681
Oh, grow up, Robin!
Of course I want a perfect wedding!

08:30.156 --> 08:34.730
Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not
to care about the wedding, but...

08:35.135 --> 08:39.051
I do. I... I'm supposed to
feel like a princess today.

08:39.155 --> 08:40.229
And you will.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.568
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

08:42.677 --> 08:45.570
Why don't we go outside? I have
something that'll make you feel better.

08:45.675 --> 08:48.889
What could you have that could
possibly make me feel better?

08:53.305 --> 08:56.592
God, I hope Marshall's having
a better day than I'm having.

08:57.716 --> 09:00.019
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:00.124 --> 09:01.462
Oh, my God.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.380
Oh, my God.

09:03.774 --> 09:05.861
- Oh, my God!
- What?

09:13.555 --> 09:15.470
Well, it's not too short.

09:28.897 --> 09:32.710
My hair! Look at my hair!
She ruined my hair!

09:32.817 --> 09:34.951
I look like one of
the Backstreet Boys!

09:35.058 --> 09:35.963
You totally do.

09:36.068 --> 09:37.520
And not even the good
Backstreet Boys,

09:37.558 --> 09:40.962
the older, lame dance move,
comeback tour Backstreet Boys.

09:41.618 --> 09:43.653
The good Backstreet Boys?

09:43.756 --> 09:45.803
Guys! Guys!
What am I gonna do?!

09:45.908 --> 09:47.790
What-what the hell
happened to you?

09:47.897 --> 09:49.552
Lily's cousin is
in beauty school,

09:49.655 --> 09:51.450
and Lily didn't want
her to do her hair,

09:51.555 --> 09:53.312
so she said she could do mine.

09:53.417 --> 09:55.913
So, um,
just not-not too short, okay?

09:56.018 --> 09:58.123
Oh, no,
we don't even have to cut it at all.

09:58.228 --> 09:59.891
Could just give it some style.

09:59.996 --> 10:01.103
Oh, okay, yeah, that's great.

10:01.137 --> 10:03.753
'Cause, um, when it gets too short,
it starts to look weird.

10:03.858 --> 10:05.993
And I don't want to look weird
when I'm up there, you know.

10:06.026 --> 10:08.522
Ooh, I could give you
some cool guy tips.

10:08.978 --> 10:11.492
I don't think I need
advice on how to be cool,

10:11.597 --> 10:13.942
but yeah, great,
lay that on me.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.870
I can't get married like this!
There's no way!

10:17.975 --> 10:19.380
Ah, let me see what I can do.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.263
What? What can you do?

10:21.815 --> 10:23.422
I have a superpower.

10:24.158 --> 10:26.370
Lily is gonna kill me!

10:26.478 --> 10:27.383
Look at me!

10:27.487 --> 10:29.081
She's not gonna want
to marry me like this.

10:29.118 --> 10:30.741
That's crazy.
Of course she will.

10:30.846 --> 10:31.810
Would you marry me?

10:31.916 --> 10:34.530
No. But not because of the hair.
It's because I have a rule:

10:34.635 --> 10:37.460
never marry anyone you've
had a farting contest with.

10:37.567 --> 10:41.480
Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily
and I shouldn't even get married?

10:43.995 --> 10:45.922
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

10:46.955 --> 10:48.623
It's for the bride.

10:50.698 --> 10:53.510
One, the bride would...

10:53.617 --> 10:56.370
like all of this tension
out of my shoulders.

10:56.476 --> 10:59.142
And she would like, let's say,

10:59.246 --> 11:01.930
you in the inappropriately
short dress to rub them.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.310
Two...

11:05.228 --> 11:06.632
What was two?

11:07.777 --> 11:10.193
Okay, we have a
bit of a situation.

11:11.527 --> 11:12.911
Let's not panic.

11:13.828 --> 11:15.670
Let's just find a solution.

11:30.705 --> 11:33.743
Dude, you shaved
your freakin' head.

11:33.848 --> 11:35.780
Yeah, yeah, but it's good.

11:35.886 --> 11:38.683
I ought to shave it all off.
What a great solution.

11:38.786 --> 11:41.163
Just be bald 'cause
it's cool, right?

11:41.266 --> 11:43.803
Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan,
Britney Spears...

11:43.907 --> 11:45.960
Oh, God, what did I do?!

11:46.066 --> 11:47.732
How could you let
me shave my head?!

11:47.836 --> 11:49.490
- What?!
- You're the worst best man ever!

11:49.597 --> 11:50.750
I hate you!

11:50.855 --> 11:53.373
I'm not going out there!
I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.

11:53.386 --> 11:55.401
I'm gonna go find that money
under the rock by the tree

11:55.435 --> 11:57.610
and go live with the guys on
the beach in Zihautanejo.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.710
Dude, those guys are criminals.

11:58.747 --> 12:01.270
Only Red Andy was
falsely accused.

12:01.385 --> 12:03.963
Ted, you're my best man!
You got to do something!

12:04.066 --> 12:06.671
Okay, all right, come here.
Just breathe, breathe, all right?

12:06.775 --> 12:08.852
Don't worry. Don't worry.

12:10.345 --> 12:12.851
- I'll just... I'll take these.
- No!

12:16.976 --> 12:19.683
- Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?
- Yes.

12:19.786 --> 12:22.783
Yes, we're, we're having a little
bit of a problem back there.

12:22.885 --> 12:24.842
Um, and I was wondering
if you could help us out.

12:24.867 --> 12:25.800
Yeah.

12:26.665 --> 12:31.061
Marshall accidentally
shaved part of his head.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.790
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

12:32.895 --> 12:34.770
Yeah, so here's what
I was thinking.

12:34.875 --> 12:40.321
What if I found something
to cover up the bald area?

12:40.425 --> 12:42.930
Yeah, that would probably work,

12:43.037 --> 12:44.401
but with what?

12:46.008 --> 12:47.531
That's a tough one.

12:48.868 --> 12:52.042
Maybe a wig of some
sort or a, um...

12:52.145 --> 12:53.260
toupee.

12:53.367 --> 12:55.272
Something that matches
his hair color,

12:55.376 --> 13:00.023
which is, which is kind of the same
color as the top of your hair.

13:00.518 --> 13:03.050
Mm, yeah.

13:03.768 --> 13:05.843
Does anyone here wear a toupee?

13:06.257 --> 13:07.661
Shouldn't be hard to find out.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.193
Most of them are pretty bad.

13:09.296 --> 13:11.741
That is true. That is true.

13:11.847 --> 13:14.342
We just need to find
someone who wears a toupee

13:14.445 --> 13:16.291
that is the same color

13:16.395 --> 13:20.501
as Marshall's and your hair.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.853
Boy, that's a
pretty tall order.

13:23.956 --> 13:25.221
Really?

13:25.385 --> 13:28.350
You can't think of any
place in the general area

13:28.457 --> 13:30.682
where there might be a toupee of
the kind I'm describing to you?

13:30.716 --> 13:32.922
No, not off the top of my...

13:34.836 --> 13:37.391
No. Can't.

13:37.497 --> 13:40.023
Let me come at this from a different
angle. I got $50 in my pocket

13:40.056 --> 13:42.341
- which is probably a lot more...
- The bride needs this.

13:58.926 --> 14:00.881
Actually, I think
it kinda works.

14:01.246 --> 14:03.052
It totally does.

14:04.765 --> 14:05.921
Barney?

14:08.456 --> 14:10.232
To be honest, I'm, uh,

14:10.647 --> 14:12.873
I'm jealous I don't
get to wear it.

14:19.798 --> 14:21.641
Okay, problem solved.

14:21.747 --> 14:22.692
Crisis averted.

14:22.798 --> 14:24.330
Let's get me married.

14:24.438 --> 14:26.200
It looks terrible, doesn't it?

14:26.886 --> 14:28.500
It kinda looks like fur,

14:28.605 --> 14:31.281
which gives you the appearance
of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.

14:31.385 --> 14:33.390
- Oh, you know...
- In a bad way.

14:34.145 --> 14:36.653
Hey. Cool hair, bro.

14:37.008 --> 14:38.042
What happened to your shirt?

14:38.075 --> 14:40.460
I got sauce on it when
I tackled the caterer.

14:41.107 --> 14:42.282
You gonna put another shirt on?

14:42.316 --> 14:43.292
No, I'm good.

14:43.395 --> 14:45.012
Hey, you guys seen Scooter?

14:45.118 --> 14:48.703
What? What? Scooter's here?
That guy's at my wedding?

14:48.807 --> 14:50.433
Not for long, bro.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.183
Not for long.

14:55.607 --> 14:57.503
Okay, you know what?
I need some air.

14:57.607 --> 14:59.761
I think we should go
for a walk, okay?

15:02.405 --> 15:04.412
It would cover up the problem.

15:04.618 --> 15:05.723
It's festive

15:05.826 --> 15:08.692
and it celebrates the heritage
of this great nation.

15:08.798 --> 15:11.212
Okay, unless you actually
have one in your car,

15:11.316 --> 15:14.220
stop suggesting authentic
Native American headdress.

15:14.546 --> 15:15.672
Oh, no.

15:15.778 --> 15:17.743
Oh, my God!

15:19.018 --> 15:19.992
Marshall...

15:20.095 --> 15:21.783
Lily, you're not
supposed to see me.

15:21.887 --> 15:24.763
Holy crap, I don't think
anyone's supposed to see you.

15:25.187 --> 15:27.263
What happened?
Did Amy do this to you?

15:27.368 --> 15:30.100
Just the frosted tips.
I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby.

15:30.206 --> 15:32.012
I've ruined the whole wedding,
haven't I?

15:32.118 --> 15:34.360
Oh, no,
you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.853
It was already ruined.

15:35.955 --> 15:37.662
There's no flowers,
no photographer.

15:37.768 --> 15:39.520
Oh, and Scooter's here,
by the way.

15:39.628 --> 15:40.501
Yeah, I know. I heard.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.581
My veil got thrashed,
the harp player is in labor,

15:43.687 --> 15:45.763
and I'm not wearing
my wedding underwear.

15:45.868 --> 15:48.373
What? No "Property of
Marshall" across the back?

15:48.478 --> 15:50.482
How are people going to
know whose butt that is?

15:50.585 --> 15:52.230
What happened?

15:52.335 --> 15:57.300
Remember the wedding we wanted,
the intimate outdoor ceremony?

15:57.405 --> 15:59.153
I wish we could
have that wedding.

16:02.047 --> 16:03.221
So do it.

16:03.327 --> 16:04.092
What?

16:04.198 --> 16:05.571
Get married now.

16:05.797 --> 16:06.990
Right here.

16:07.097 --> 16:09.412
Look, it's outside like
you always wanted.

16:09.515 --> 16:11.521
Intimate, close friends.

16:11.627 --> 16:14.200
There's no guitar,
but it's pretty close.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.083
Barney can officiate.

16:16.916 --> 16:19.973
Yes. Yes, I can.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.351
Uh, excuse me, guys.
You all dropped something:

16:23.455 --> 16:24.702
your jaws--

16:24.805 --> 16:29.221
because Barney Stinson is about
to aid and abet a marriage.

16:30.066 --> 16:32.781
Could we even do that? I mean,
what about all those people in there?

16:32.845 --> 16:34.921
Do that one, too.
And then when everything goes wrong,

16:34.958 --> 16:37.992
you won't care because you already
had the real wedding out here.

16:40.115 --> 16:41.490
What do you think, baby?

16:41.988 --> 16:43.463
I love it.

16:43.606 --> 16:44.760
Me, too.

16:44.867 --> 16:47.861
Let's do it.
Let's get married before we get married.

16:48.266 --> 16:49.241
Great.

16:49.587 --> 16:51.250
Wait, hold on.

16:52.828 --> 16:54.331
Excuse me, sir.

16:54.437 --> 16:56.563
Could we borrow your hat?

16:57.837 --> 16:58.772
Okay.

16:58.876 --> 17:00.182
Thank you.

17:08.416 --> 17:09.531
Hat.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.183
We thought of authentic
Native American headdress

17:12.288 --> 17:14.310
before we thought of hat.

17:16.317 --> 17:17.902
Thank you all for coming.

17:19.268 --> 17:21.672
For those of you
who don't know me...

17:22.446 --> 17:25.040
I'm not the biggest
believer in marriage.

17:26.755 --> 17:31.651
But... you two are so great together,
you know?

17:35.716 --> 17:39.672
It's like you were, uh,
made for each other.

17:39.837 --> 17:41.993
- He's gonna cry.
- No, I'm not.

17:47.487 --> 17:49.430
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not, I'm not.

17:55.256 --> 17:56.740
Lily and Marshall...

17:58.045 --> 18:00.563
when everyone sees you, they...

18:01.125 --> 18:02.721
see true love.

18:05.477 --> 18:07.203
It's the best love...

18:11.095 --> 18:15.543
Can we just, um,
move on to the rings or something?

18:18.825 --> 18:20.162
Oh, no.

18:21.387 --> 18:22.653
I don't have my vows.

18:22.758 --> 18:24.182
I don't have mine either.

18:24.285 --> 18:27.693
You don't need your vows.
Just say why you love each other.

18:30.357 --> 18:31.721
Okay, I'll go first.

18:34.296 --> 18:35.421
Lily,

18:36.255 --> 18:38.940
there are a million
reasons why I love you.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.280
You make me laugh

18:41.607 --> 18:44.032
and you take care of
me when I'm sick.

18:44.405 --> 18:49.143
You're sweet, caring and you even
created an egg dish and named it after me.

18:49.247 --> 18:51.993
She puts a little Italian dressing in
scrambled eggs before she cooks them.

18:52.028 --> 18:54.671
It's called "Eggs Marshall,"
and it's awesome.

18:56.408 --> 18:59.171
But the main reason
that I love you is

18:59.278 --> 19:01.203
that you're my
best friend, Lily.

19:01.406 --> 19:04.212
You're, uh...
you're the best friend I ever had.

19:04.737 --> 19:06.313
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- No problem.

19:06.418 --> 19:07.693
It's totally okay.

19:09.127 --> 19:10.301
My turn.

19:10.666 --> 19:12.153
Oh, thank you.

19:13.067 --> 19:17.980
Marshall, I love you
because you're funny

19:18.085 --> 19:20.670
and you make me feel loved

19:20.777 --> 19:23.433
and you make me feel safe

19:23.535 --> 19:27.203
and for our anniversary you
gave me a sweatshirt that says,

19:27.307 --> 19:30.583
"Lily and Marshall.
Rockin' It Since '96."

19:31.308 --> 19:33.643
I kinda wish I was
wearing it right now

19:33.746 --> 19:36.791
'cause it smells like you.

19:37.626 --> 19:40.780
But the main reason I love you,
Marshall Ericksen,

19:40.887 --> 19:43.811
is you make me happy.

19:44.315 --> 19:46.583
You make me happy all the time.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.392
Hey, I found your panties!

19:54.106 --> 19:55.503
I'm good.

19:57.807 --> 20:00.290
Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife
to have and to hold from this day forward?

20:00.325 --> 20:01.140
- Slow down.
- I can't.

20:01.176 --> 20:03.183
From this day forward so as
long as you both shall live?

20:03.217 --> 20:04.182
I do.

20:04.288 --> 20:07.783
Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to
be your husband to have and to hold... live?

20:07.886 --> 20:08.542
I do.

20:08.645 --> 20:09.870
Okay, then,

20:10.017 --> 20:13.933
by the power invested in me by
the very bitter old Pakistani man

20:14.038 --> 20:16.533
who works down at the
courthouse on Lafayette Street,

20:16.695 --> 20:19.940
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

20:20.307 --> 20:21.902
You may kiss the bride.

20:29.357 --> 20:31.271
- Do you smoke?
- No.

20:31.375 --> 20:34.882
Wow. First lie of marriage.
That was fast.

20:36.787 --> 20:39.890
After that, we all went back
inside for the second wedding.

20:39.996 --> 20:41.940
And yes,
a lot of things did go wrong,

20:42.047 --> 20:43.100
but it didn't matter

20:43.205 --> 20:45.343
because when I look
back on that day,

20:45.448 --> 20:47.383
what I remember is
the first wedding;

20:47.485 --> 20:49.502
the intimate outdoor ceremony

20:49.607 --> 20:51.261
with just close friends

20:51.368 --> 20:53.270
and an acoustic guitar.

21:07.029 --> 21:08.193
How do you feel?

21:08.309 --> 21:11.381
Tired. I got
married twice today.

21:15.388 --> 21:18.192
So where do you want to do it for
the first time as a married couple,

21:18.296 --> 21:21.081
nice hotel room or a
reception hall bathroom?

21:21.188 --> 21:22.521
What do you think?

21:22.627 --> 21:24.702
Bathroom, of course.

21:25.668 --> 21:27.313
Please don't.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.383
- Sorry, Ted.
- Sorry, Ted.
