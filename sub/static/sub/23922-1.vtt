WEBVTT

00:09.790 --> 00:13.330
Please raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

00:13.360 --> 00:19.200
I, Donald John Trump,
do solemnly swear...

00:19.240 --> 00:21.770
Glen, what's going on

00:21.810 --> 00:23.640
Calling it a multi-billion
dollar Ponzi scheme.

00:23.670 --> 00:26.640
My retirement money...

00:26.680 --> 00:28.850
Fuck.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.680
Give it some time.

00:30.710 --> 00:32.780
It's a bad time right now.

00:32.820 --> 00:35.390
You're poison.
No firm will hire you.

00:35.420 --> 00:38.220
I called the fake news
the enemy of the people.

00:38.260 --> 00:41.230
And they are. They are
the enemy of the people.

00:41.260 --> 00:44.460
We stand in the face of
opposition fearlessly.

00:44.490 --> 00:47.200
Now, that's what this firm
represents. Hmm?

00:47.230 --> 00:50.730
Okay, okay. We still have
a firm to operate.

00:50.770 --> 00:53.770
Besides, we don't want to
exhaust our founding partner.

00:53.800 --> 00:59.210
You also had people that were
very fine people on both sides.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.280
Feels like something's
come detached, you know,

01:02.310 --> 01:05.280
like a piece of machinery
that doesn't sound right.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.350
The only constant
we have is the law.

01:08.390 --> 01:10.750
I'm glad I'm here,
Adrian.

01:10.790 --> 01:13.220
I'm glad you're
here, too, Diane.

01:13.260 --> 01:14.420
There was absolutely
no collusion.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.190
Everybody knows it.

01:16.230 --> 01:17.860
Bottom line, they all say
there's no collusion.

01:17.890 --> 01:19.500
And there is no collusion.

01:19.530 --> 01:21.170
Hi, I'm Lucca Quinn.
Hi.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.470
This is my client,
Maia Rindell.
Hi.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.430
I'm Federal Agent
Madeline Starkey.

01:24.470 --> 01:27.140
And, uh, why don't we
have a seat and chat?

01:27.170 --> 01:29.840
I think you knew about
your parent's Ponzi scheme.

01:29.870 --> 01:32.140
And I'm going to recommend
prosecution

01:32.180 --> 01:33.510
by the U.S. Attorney's Office.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.480
Maia Rindell.

01:35.510 --> 01:37.250
Your dad fled.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.280
You're under arrest.

01:42.890 --> 01:44.890
*

02:12.920 --> 02:14.920
*

02:42.950 --> 02:45.820
*

03:15.610 --> 03:18.280
* I'm on my way

03:18.320 --> 03:20.950
* To the kingdom of heaven

03:20.980 --> 03:24.250
* I'm on my way

03:24.290 --> 03:27.420
* To the kingdom on high

03:27.460 --> 03:29.430
* I'm on my way

03:29.460 --> 03:33.400
* Singin' glory, hallelujah

03:33.430 --> 03:35.570
* Gonna make my new home

03:35.600 --> 03:37.400
* In the kingdom in the sky

03:41.870 --> 03:44.840
Liz, I am so sorry.

03:44.870 --> 03:45.880
Thank you, Rod.

03:45.910 --> 03:47.440
Michelle and Barack asked me

03:47.480 --> 03:49.480
to extend their condolences.
Thank you.

03:49.510 --> 03:52.580
They loved your tweet,
by the way.
Oh, thank you.

03:52.620 --> 03:54.950
I don't know that it's gonna
go over so well at work, but...

03:54.980 --> 03:57.850
It had to be said.
Yeah.

03:57.890 --> 04:00.590
* Gonna make our new home

04:00.620 --> 04:02.860
* In the kingdom in the sky...

04:02.890 --> 04:05.360
Hey.

04:09.070 --> 04:10.870
Your daddy was a fighter

04:10.900 --> 04:12.600
all the way to the end.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.870
Yeah. It's the
end of an era.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.870
Liz, the-- that photo.

04:16.910 --> 04:18.940
Oh, yeah.

04:18.980 --> 04:21.680
Not my choice.
Dad liked it, so...

04:21.710 --> 04:24.380
Well, you know, he did have
a lot of fun that day.

04:24.410 --> 04:26.920
Yeah. Well,
that didn't last.

04:29.690 --> 04:31.990
Look, I'm sorry.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.460
And if you need anything,
you know where I am.

04:34.490 --> 04:36.560
Yeah, uh, Sandy said
you wanted the name?

04:36.590 --> 04:39.900
It just seemed
like a good idea

04:39.930 --> 04:42.370
for continuity's sake.
You don't think that's
false advertising?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.330
"Reddick/Boseman"
without the Reddick?

04:44.370 --> 04:46.970
Why don't, why don't we
talk about this later?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.010
Yeah. Sure. When you take
my dad's name off the firm.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.910
Liz. Is this about us?

04:51.940 --> 04:53.640
* The kingdom on high...

04:53.680 --> 04:57.510
No. Why do you ask?

04:57.550 --> 04:59.380
Because if it's
about a percentage,

04:59.420 --> 05:01.920
you know I will talk
to the partners.

05:04.390 --> 05:06.060
Mrs. Harden, thank you
so much for coming.

05:06.090 --> 05:09.430
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.460
* Lord, I'm on my way

05:14.500 --> 05:16.530
* I'm on my way

05:19.700 --> 05:22.470
* I'm on my way

05:22.510 --> 05:24.570
* Hey, I'm on my way...

05:24.610 --> 05:27.440
Excuse me.
Got to get by. Excuse me.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.950
Excuse me.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.650
* To the kingdom on high

05:31.680 --> 05:34.050
* I'm on my way...

05:34.080 --> 05:36.450
I know, weird, huh?

05:36.490 --> 05:38.090
I didn't plan
this, by the way.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.660
I just read the
announcement in the newspaper

05:40.690 --> 05:42.690
and I wanted to
pay my respects.

05:44.730 --> 05:46.960
Okay, I can see
your incredulity,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.100
so let me admit, I was
hoping I'd see you here.

05:50.130 --> 05:53.400
This isn't purely
accidental.

05:53.440 --> 05:57.040
You want to know why?

05:57.070 --> 05:58.610
I felt guilty.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.580
I was probably instrumental
in getting you arrested.

06:02.610 --> 06:04.650
Sure, that's my job, to
find the needle of guilt

06:04.680 --> 06:06.580
in the haystack of denials,

06:06.620 --> 06:09.090
but I couldn't stop
thinking about you, Maia.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.990
And I think you're a
really good person.

06:12.020 --> 06:15.160
And I have a suggestion.

06:23.030 --> 06:25.130
Okay, this is
what I want to do.

06:25.170 --> 06:27.000
I know, I know.
I'm irritating,

06:27.040 --> 06:28.610
but I can't clear
my conscience

06:28.640 --> 06:31.440
without trying this.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.710
Your trial is in six days.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.510
You could go to
prison for five years.

06:37.550 --> 06:40.650
Now, what are you,
29 years old?

06:40.680 --> 06:44.550
That is a bad stretch
of time to be in prison.

06:44.590 --> 06:47.560
You know, when I was in college,
UC San Diego...

06:50.490 --> 06:53.530
I went down to Tijuana
with some girl friends...

06:53.560 --> 06:55.130
and they were put in jail

06:55.160 --> 06:57.800
for a week,

06:57.830 --> 07:00.200
and they were never
the same again.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.170
Never.

07:02.210 --> 07:03.570
Do you mind?

07:03.610 --> 07:04.840
Hmph!

07:08.580 --> 07:11.850
You tell me everything you
know about your father,

07:11.880 --> 07:15.180
where he is,
where he fled,

07:15.220 --> 07:17.520
and I will prevail
on the prosecutors

07:17.550 --> 07:19.060
to drop the charges.

07:19.090 --> 07:23.190
You will never have
to go to prison.

07:23.230 --> 07:25.060
Okay, I know what
you're gonna say.

07:25.090 --> 07:26.630
You're gonna say you don't
know where your dad is.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.160
You have no idea.

07:28.200 --> 07:32.100
But here's the thing,
I have some evidence.

07:32.140 --> 07:35.270
And my guess is you don't
know what you know.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.540
So tell me everything.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.710
I probably deserve this.

07:41.750 --> 07:45.110
Okay. Uh, I think you
should reconsider, Maia.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.520
Okay, I know what
you're gonna say.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.090
You're gonna say you don't
know where your dad is.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.590
You have no idea.
But here's the thing,

07:53.620 --> 07:55.630
I have some...

07:56.590 --> 07:58.630
I have some evidence.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.560
And my guess is you don't know
what you know.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.230
Did she show you
the evidence?
No.

08:05.270 --> 08:07.670
It's probably bullshit,

08:07.700 --> 08:09.710
but let's get a free peek.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.110
Maybe we can use it
at trial, Brady violation.

08:12.140 --> 08:14.710
Do we trust her?
No.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.210
But we don't have to.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.680
You okay?

08:19.720 --> 08:22.590
No. Everything's
spinning out of control.

08:22.620 --> 08:26.560
That's what it feels like
on the eve of trial.

08:27.790 --> 08:30.630
they're not smarter than us.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.900
So we still
on for Monday?

08:33.930 --> 08:35.600
Uh, we are.
Good.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.770
Uh, Barack is worried
about the suit.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.870
It's a nuisance
suit, Rod.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.770
That is public trust land.

08:41.810 --> 08:44.270
Yeah. I-I know, but we don't
want to big foot Cook County

08:44.310 --> 08:46.140
to make way
for the library.

08:46.180 --> 08:47.910
We will move gently.

08:47.940 --> 08:49.350
All right. Yeah.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.210
We'd better find a seat.
Yeah.

08:53.180 --> 08:56.220
* Oh, oh, glory

09:01.760 --> 09:06.300
* Of the coming of an age

09:10.670 --> 09:15.170
* To bring a soulful change

09:19.210 --> 09:21.310
Wilbur.

09:21.340 --> 09:24.210
Liz, I'm so sorry.
Thank you.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.950
Listen, I-I saw your e-mail,

09:26.980 --> 09:28.750
and don't worry,
I'll be at work next week.

09:28.790 --> 09:30.750
No, take your time.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.260
You need the time.

09:32.290 --> 09:33.890
Ma'am.
Uh, yeah.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.660
I-I-I-I don't need the time.
I'm coming in.

09:36.690 --> 09:38.760
Let's talk about it later.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.860
Why does everybody want to
talk about things later?

09:40.900 --> 09:43.200
Let's talk about it right now.

09:43.230 --> 09:47.370
I need you to take a few
weeks out of the spotlight.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.810
Let the other AUSAs
handle your cases.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.340
Then we'll slip you back
into the regular rotation.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.810
Why?

09:54.840 --> 09:56.710
You know why.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.350
The tweet?

09:58.380 --> 10:01.250
Like it or not, Trump
is our ultimate boss.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.220
I thought you were
our ultimate boss.

10:03.250 --> 10:04.650
Yeah, and he's my boss,

10:04.690 --> 10:06.220
and you called him
a white supremacist.

10:06.260 --> 10:08.260
Oh, my God.

10:08.290 --> 10:12.230
I just need you to stay out
of the rotation for a cycle.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.960
And if I say no... ?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.230
Liz.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.230
I'm your friend.

10:17.270 --> 10:19.670
Take the three
weeks off, okay?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.680
* This truth

10:28.710 --> 10:32.420
* I do procla...

10:34.750 --> 10:35.720
Diane.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.990
Oh, Colin.
How are you?

10:38.020 --> 10:39.890
Good. Are you going
to the funeral?

10:39.920 --> 10:43.390
Yes. Um, can you support
me with a continuance?

10:43.430 --> 10:45.060
Yeah. It's a
new judge today.

10:45.090 --> 10:46.860
Just appointed.
Shouldn't have a problem.

10:46.900 --> 10:48.830
Thanks. I'm-I'm
already quite late.

10:48.870 --> 10:50.270
Mmm. It's terrible,
isn't it?

10:50.300 --> 10:51.430
I just saw him last week.

10:51.470 --> 10:54.270
You did

10:54.300 --> 10:56.270
On Lake Michigan,
windsurfing.

10:56.310 --> 11:00.010
You saw Carl Reddick
windsurfing?
Yeah.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.010
What? No. Roger Hill.

11:02.050 --> 11:04.750
Reddick? Oh.
Oh, that's right.

11:04.780 --> 11:06.750
Uh, you're going to
the Reddick funeral.

11:06.780 --> 11:08.450
Yes, in ten minutes.
Roger Hill is dead?

11:08.480 --> 11:10.320
Yeah. Yeah.

11:10.350 --> 11:13.360
Uh, yeah, he was killed
in a hit-and-run.

11:13.390 --> 11:16.890
Oh, my God. Roger Hill
of Hill and Masters?
Yeah.

11:16.930 --> 11:19.330
He was crossing LaSalle
and a van just...

11:19.360 --> 11:20.830
killed him instantly.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.030
Oh, my God,
that's awful.

11:22.070 --> 11:23.430
Yeah, it makes
you think, doesn't it?

11:23.470 --> 11:26.040
He was 38.

11:26.070 --> 11:29.440
He was going through
a divorce.
Oh.

11:29.470 --> 11:31.310
How's Lucca doing?

11:31.340 --> 11:33.110
Lucca, oh, she's well.

11:33.140 --> 11:34.440
She's on the
partner track.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.450
Oh. Tell her, uh,
congratulations.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.920
All rise.

11:38.950 --> 11:40.320
The court is
now in session.

11:40.350 --> 11:41.990
His Honor,
Lyman, presiding.

11:42.020 --> 11:44.320
Can we do something
about these steps?

11:44.350 --> 11:45.490
They're a little steep.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.020
I will work on
it, Your Honor.

11:47.060 --> 11:48.090
And what's with
the air conditioning?

11:48.120 --> 11:49.330
What'd you do,
turn if off?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.760
They're fixing it,
Your Honor.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.900
Course these-these robes
are like an oven.

11:52.930 --> 11:54.060
Everybody can sit down.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.430
Well, we have, um,

11:57.470 --> 12:01.070
today, we have--
what do we have today?

12:01.100 --> 12:03.110
Voir dire,
Your Honor.
Ah.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.870
A quick motion, Your Honor.
Both counselors

12:04.910 --> 12:06.110
would like to request
a continuance.

12:06.140 --> 12:08.380
What is all this stuff?

12:08.410 --> 12:10.510
Um, your docket,
Your Honor.

12:10.550 --> 12:11.780
Oh, my docket.

12:11.820 --> 12:13.550
Oh. Okay.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.350
Howard.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.120
Hello.
Oh, hi, Diane.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.960
What do you think about
all this?

12:18.990 --> 12:21.460
Not bad for a kid
from the Southside.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.930
Yes, quite surprising.
What are you doing?

12:22.960 --> 12:24.430
You look like you're going
to a funeral.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.100
Actually, yes, I am.

12:26.130 --> 12:28.900
Th-th-this is the reason
for the continuance, Your Honor,

12:28.930 --> 12:29.930
so counselor can
attend this funeral.

12:29.970 --> 12:30.930
Who's funeral, Hill's?

12:30.970 --> 12:32.070
No, Carl Reddick's.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.540
Carl "Hymietown" Reddick?

12:34.570 --> 12:36.970
Uh, again, we have no issue
with this continuance,

12:37.010 --> 12:39.910
so...
He and Jesse Jackson
had quite a time

12:39.940 --> 12:42.410
enjoying talking
about "Hymietown."

12:42.450 --> 12:44.050
That doesn't sound
quite right, Howard.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.180
Uh. Your Honor.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.380
Hmm?
Your Honor.

12:48.420 --> 12:49.450
Motion denied, Counselor.

12:49.490 --> 12:51.860
We will deal
with voir dire right now.

12:56.990 --> 12:58.560
* I will trust

12:58.590 --> 13:01.530
* In the Lord

13:01.560 --> 13:08.870
* Till I die...

13:13.110 --> 13:16.050
Carl Reddick was born

13:16.080 --> 13:19.050
when Nazis were marching
in the streets.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.150
And he died when Nazis
were marching in the streets.

13:23.190 --> 13:25.490
Every day of his life,

13:25.520 --> 13:29.560
he fought against aggression,
totalitarianism,

13:29.590 --> 13:32.430
ignorance.

13:32.460 --> 13:34.900
Carl stood with Dr. King.

13:34.930 --> 13:36.530
Yes, he did.

13:36.570 --> 13:39.500
He stood
on the bridge at Selma.

13:39.540 --> 13:43.970
I quake when I think
of the bravery that took.

13:44.010 --> 13:46.910
And yet, I'm a partner
at a firm bearing his name...

13:49.950 --> 13:52.080
...and I know I failed him.

13:55.990 --> 14:00.260
He challenged us to use the law
as a force for good.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.530
He saw we were becoming

14:02.560 --> 14:06.260
obsessed with money,
billable hours,

14:06.300 --> 14:08.560
the pragmatic
over the idealistic.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.230
Damn.

14:10.270 --> 14:12.470
What?

14:12.500 --> 14:15.600
The Obama Library.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.570
The law, for Carl,

14:17.610 --> 14:19.110
was a shining guide.

14:19.140 --> 14:20.540
I'll talk to him.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.080
He knows it's
just rhetoric.

14:22.110 --> 14:23.480
It was hope.

14:23.510 --> 14:25.080
It was a summit.

14:25.110 --> 14:27.220
He saw that we were
looking at the law

14:27.250 --> 14:29.990
as a set of rules
to be twisted.

14:30.020 --> 14:34.960
The issues today
are just as real

14:34.990 --> 14:38.260
as the issues Carl faced,
maybe even more real.

14:38.290 --> 14:43.630
And Carl Reddick
would say to us,

14:43.670 --> 14:47.640
"Please don't bury
my ideals with me."

14:47.670 --> 14:49.970
Mr. Habercore?

14:50.010 --> 14:52.140
Julius. Amazing eulogy.

14:52.180 --> 14:54.080
Yes, it was.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.580
Made you think.

14:55.610 --> 14:58.580
Uh, we're still on
for lunch Monday, right?

14:58.610 --> 15:01.520
To discuss the, uh,
presidential library?

15:01.550 --> 15:04.320
Well, um, actually,

15:04.350 --> 15:07.120
do you mind if I
give you a call?

15:07.160 --> 15:09.530
Um... sure.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.530
You know, Barbara will be
at the lunch, too.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.530
She can discuss the ways

15:14.560 --> 15:17.170
that we'll be living up
to Carl's name.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.600
That sounds good.
I'll give you a call.

15:30.210 --> 15:31.750
We're in trouble.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.720
Mr. Boseman,
I just got a...
Damn it.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.620
Just, just... later.
We have an issue here, okay?

15:36.650 --> 15:39.120
Come on.

15:40.390 --> 15:42.560
Lucca, hi.

15:42.590 --> 15:45.230
Ms. Starkey, how are you?

15:45.260 --> 15:47.230
How is your fictional husband?

15:47.260 --> 15:49.100
Oh, I've missed you.

15:49.130 --> 15:51.230
And my fictional husband
says "Hello," by the way.

15:51.270 --> 15:53.570
Hmm. I understand
you've been conversing

15:53.600 --> 15:55.570
with my client
without my permission.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.640
Well, actually, I was doing
most of the conversing.

15:57.670 --> 16:00.280
She was a very good girl.
She didn't say a word.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.210
Oh. Good.
Mm.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.580
She also told me
that you offered her a deal.

16:04.610 --> 16:09.120
Really? I'm not sure that's
exactly what happened.

16:09.150 --> 16:11.320
You tell me everything
you know about your dad.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.720
You will never have
to go to prison.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.660
Mmm. Oh, my goodness,
I missed you two.

16:16.690 --> 16:18.230
Oh, wait.
There's one more part.

16:18.260 --> 16:19.630
Oh, okay.

16:19.660 --> 16:22.070
I have some evidence,

16:22.100 --> 16:23.600
and my guess is
you don't know what you know.

16:23.630 --> 16:27.300
So what evidence
are we talking about here?

16:27.340 --> 16:30.410
Because the DOJ supposedly
gave us all their discovery.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.140
Oh, no Brady violation.
Oh, no.

16:32.180 --> 16:34.180
This just fell
into our hands two days ago.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.610
It's why I'm here.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.110
And, of course,
to pay my respects.

16:38.150 --> 16:39.380
Oh, of course.

16:39.420 --> 16:41.280
A surveillance camera
from the Royal

16:41.320 --> 16:43.090
World Bank of Dubai.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.390
Have you ever been to Dubai?

16:44.420 --> 16:45.820
Very strange place.

16:45.850 --> 16:47.620
It must be
what my ancestors felt

16:47.660 --> 16:49.660
when they got off the boat
in Manhattan.

16:50.730 --> 16:53.160
And that's just an aside.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.630
Anyway,

16:54.660 --> 16:56.100
this surveillance photo

16:56.130 --> 16:57.400
was taken of a customer

16:57.430 --> 16:59.670
withdrawing
$1.2 million

16:59.700 --> 17:02.240
from an account set up
by your father,

17:02.270 --> 17:04.840
Henry Rindell.
Now,

17:04.870 --> 17:07.280
Dubai was surveilling this
account, but, uh, they let

17:07.310 --> 17:09.680
this person slip
through their fingers.

17:10.850 --> 17:13.320
We want to find her.

17:13.350 --> 17:17.650
My guess is if we find her,
we'll find your father.

17:17.690 --> 17:21.760
And if we find your father,
it helps both of us.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.790
Bated breath,
Ms. Starkey. Bated.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.700
We'll need a moment with this.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.850
Hey, Barbara.

17:49.890 --> 17:51.190
Barbara. Barbara.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.160
What the hell was that?

17:53.190 --> 17:55.620
What the hell was what?
Your speech.
You're making it

17:55.660 --> 17:57.890
sound like we're pissing all
over the man's grave, Barbara.

17:57.930 --> 17:59.560
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.460
Look, I know
we're not perfect, Barbara,

18:01.500 --> 18:03.470
but I spent four months
at Andrew Hart's firm.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.800
You haven't seen dysfunction
till you've gone somewhere else.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.500
What are you two worried about?

18:07.540 --> 18:10.610
Uh, Habercore.
The Obama Library, Barbara.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.240
He's not coming
to lunch on Monday.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.180
You talk to him, Barbara.

18:16.210 --> 18:19.150
You tell him we are
the good guys. Now you tell him.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.780
Where's Diane?

18:20.820 --> 18:22.590
He's not my client.
He's Diane's.

18:22.620 --> 18:25.720
He's all of our client, Barbara.

18:28.790 --> 18:31.160
Where's Diane?
Uh...

18:31.190 --> 18:32.860
Oh.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.200
Oh, hey, uh...
Marissa.

18:35.230 --> 18:36.670
Right, Marissa.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.470
Where is Diane?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.770
Um...

18:40.800 --> 18:42.810
Uh...

18:42.840 --> 18:44.670
You know,

18:44.710 --> 18:46.640
actually,

18:46.680 --> 18:49.480
what was the question again?

18:49.510 --> 18:53.750
Do you think
you can judge this case fairly?

18:53.780 --> 18:57.490
Okay, here's the thing.

18:57.520 --> 19:01.490
"Fairly" is one of those
words, you know, like "cold"

19:01.520 --> 19:04.230
or "hot." It's open
to interpretation.

19:04.260 --> 19:05.660
Are you fair, ma'am?

19:05.690 --> 19:06.930
With what?

19:06.960 --> 19:08.560
Anything. Everything.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.670
Well, I hope I am.
I want to be...

19:10.700 --> 19:11.900
Yes. Good. Accepted.

19:11.930 --> 19:13.770
Yeah, we're fine here,
too, Your Honor.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.270
I just have a few questions.
Oh, dear God.

19:16.310 --> 19:18.270
Something you wanted
to say, Ms. Lockhart?

19:18.310 --> 19:20.540
No, Your Honor.
I'm just standing here.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.510
How are we doing
with that air conditioning?

19:22.550 --> 19:24.550
They're still working
on it, Your Honor.
Hmm.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.250
So, let's talk
about your job, miss.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.850
I can't judge whether...

19:36.990 --> 19:39.190
*

19:49.640 --> 19:51.710
Okay, who is she?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.750
I don't know.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.690
Maia, you have the worst
poker face in the world.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.990
Come on. I'm your lawyer.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.960
This could keep you
out of jail.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.000
Ah...

20:14.030 --> 20:16.000
There was someone

20:16.030 --> 20:18.000
I knew, uh...

20:18.030 --> 20:20.040
Someone who...

20:20.070 --> 20:21.940
A friend of the family?

20:21.970 --> 20:23.940
No.

20:27.340 --> 20:28.980
Rosalie.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.850
Rosalie who?

20:30.880 --> 20:32.980
Oh, I can't remember
her last name.

20:33.020 --> 20:35.380
Well, who was she?

20:37.020 --> 20:39.590
She was my tennis coach.

20:39.620 --> 20:41.690
You're sure that's her?

20:41.720 --> 20:43.360
I don't know.

20:43.390 --> 20:45.930
Uh, that doesn't make
any sense. It just...

21:02.650 --> 21:04.880
Oh, shit. Sorry.

21:04.910 --> 21:06.650
No.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.950
Uh, well,
when was this?

21:10.650 --> 21:12.360
12 years ago?

21:12.390 --> 21:14.760
She was only with us
for a few months.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.390
Why?

21:20.100 --> 21:21.960
My parents

21:22.000 --> 21:24.370
didn't want her
to coach me anymore.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.970
They thought...

21:28.700 --> 21:30.810
They thought
we were getting too close.

21:36.810 --> 21:39.680
Then why is she picking up
your dad's money in Dubai?

21:41.950 --> 21:43.790
I have no idea.

21:43.820 --> 21:47.660
I like BLTs, Your Honor, but I'm
not biased against kosher food.

21:47.690 --> 21:50.660
I don't think I
have any opinion.

21:50.690 --> 21:52.400
The reason I asked
is because, you know,

21:52.430 --> 21:54.760
sometimes the jurors can't
control the kind of food

21:54.800 --> 21:56.130
that's ordered in the jury room.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.770
Oh, uh...

21:57.800 --> 22:00.740
Well, I had a bad
reaction to MSG

22:00.770 --> 22:02.440
a few years ago.
That's about it.

22:02.470 --> 22:04.810
Mm-hmm. Me, too.
Chinese food.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.070
I'm telling you,
I had the runs

22:06.110 --> 22:07.940
that wouldn't stop...
Your Honor?

22:07.980 --> 22:09.950
Your Honor? We've already
accepted this juror.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.810
Yeah, I know.

22:11.850 --> 22:14.020
Let's turn to some of the
hardships we're talking about.

22:14.050 --> 22:15.920
You say you worked
in an amusement park?

22:17.990 --> 22:20.120
Ford?

22:20.160 --> 22:22.930
Ford Hello?

22:43.180 --> 22:45.150
Diane?

22:45.180 --> 22:47.780
Oh, good. I thought
I was the only one late.

22:47.820 --> 22:49.050
Hello, Renee.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.420
Are you coming from
another funeral?

22:51.450 --> 22:53.120
No. Court.
Oh.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.460
It's so weird-- two
funerals in one day.

22:55.490 --> 22:57.430
Oh, you were
at Roger's funeral?

22:57.460 --> 22:59.090
Who?
Roger Hill.

22:59.130 --> 23:00.900
Oh, right.

23:00.930 --> 23:03.430
That was awful.
Hit-and-run?
Yes.

23:03.470 --> 23:05.800
Uh, no, I was at Michael
Sommers' funeral,

23:05.830 --> 23:07.140
one of our partners.

23:07.170 --> 23:09.970
Michael Sommers

23:10.010 --> 23:13.440
Yes, last week, horseback
riding. A stroke.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.740
Oh, my God.
What is going on?

23:15.780 --> 23:17.180
It's like a plague.

23:17.210 --> 23:18.950
I just came from court.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.150
One of the sheriffs
had a heart attack.

23:21.180 --> 23:22.990
What?!
Yes, he's in the hospital.

23:23.020 --> 23:24.750
What is happening?

23:24.790 --> 23:26.920
Well, probably nothing.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.120
It's like when you
take up Pilates,

23:29.160 --> 23:31.590
and everywhere you
look, there's Pilates.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.800
We are going to a funeral,
we're standing in a cemetery,

23:36.830 --> 23:38.100
you just came
from another funeral,

23:38.130 --> 23:39.940
and there was
a third funeral today.

23:39.970 --> 23:42.000
That is not Pilates.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.870
You have a good point.

23:44.910 --> 23:47.040
* Swing low

23:47.080 --> 23:52.780
* Sweet chariot

23:58.190 --> 24:00.790
Diane, I'm sorry.

24:00.820 --> 24:02.930
For?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.860
Last year.
Not hiring you.

24:04.890 --> 24:07.200
Not extending a hand
when you needed it.

24:07.230 --> 24:09.000
It's all right, Renee.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.100
Look, let's get lunch.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.540
I would love
to catch up.

24:13.570 --> 24:15.570
Maybe another time.

24:15.600 --> 24:19.170
* And what did I see?

24:24.910 --> 24:26.210
Directions
to the reception?
Yes, thank you very much.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.620
You're very welcome.

24:27.650 --> 24:30.290
* Coming for...

24:30.320 --> 24:31.950
Miss Starkey?

24:31.990 --> 24:33.860
We might have
something for you.
Oh.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.260
Good news. What?
Depends on the offer.

24:36.290 --> 24:38.560
Well, you help us find your dad,

24:38.590 --> 24:40.000
we drop all charges.

24:40.030 --> 24:41.230
No.

24:41.260 --> 24:43.230
She helps you find
the woman in the photo,

24:43.270 --> 24:44.870
and you drop all charges.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.970
No.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.240
Okay.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.070
Good talking to you.

24:50.110 --> 24:51.270
Maia, why are you
still protecting your dad?

24:51.310 --> 24:52.540
He left you holding the bag.

24:52.580 --> 24:53.640
Unless you have
a better offer,

24:53.680 --> 24:55.640
this is a useless
conversation.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.950
He's a bad man.

24:57.980 --> 24:59.210
Listen to this.

24:59.250 --> 25:00.950
It'll tell you why.

25:00.980 --> 25:02.850
No, thank you.

25:02.890 --> 25:04.850
It's a wiretap of your father.
Listen to it.

25:04.890 --> 25:06.320
If this is discovery, it
should've been included.

25:06.350 --> 25:08.920
Maia, we should object
to this Brady violation.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.860
Listen to it, Maia,
and stop protecting him.

25:11.890 --> 25:14.000
He's not the man
you think he is.

25:14.030 --> 25:16.970
* Coming for to carry me...

25:17.000 --> 25:19.300
Wow, she's gotten
a little harder.

25:19.330 --> 25:21.140
Hi, Rod.

25:21.170 --> 25:23.870
Excellent eulogy, by the way.

25:23.910 --> 25:25.670
Oh, thank you,
though I think I took our firm

25:25.710 --> 25:27.640
a little too hard to task.
No.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.110
It felt good to me.

25:29.140 --> 25:31.010
I know Carl was disappointed

25:31.050 --> 25:33.220
in the firm taking on Chumhum,
a company

25:33.250 --> 25:35.580
Hey, Rod.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.220
Good to see you.
Diane.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.890
I didn't see you in church.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.620
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
I was held up in court.

25:40.660 --> 25:42.090
But I just wanted

25:42.120 --> 25:44.160
to reiterate
that our firm is best

25:44.190 --> 25:46.900
to handle your
presidential library issues.

25:46.930 --> 25:48.300
You need someone who knows

25:48.330 --> 25:51.270
how to be both pragmatic
and idealistic.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.300
Good.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.600
Then we'll talk over
lunch next week.

25:55.640 --> 25:59.010
Ah, look, you two
don't have to worry.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.080
It-it isn't
about your eulogy, Barbara.

26:02.110 --> 26:04.180
The Obamas love Reddick.

26:04.210 --> 26:05.610
I know they do.

26:05.650 --> 26:07.950
I mean his daughter.

26:07.980 --> 26:10.220
And Liz is going somewhere else.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.160
I'm sorry?

26:13.190 --> 26:14.990
Liz Reddick.

26:15.020 --> 26:17.760
She was let go from
the Department of Justice today.

26:19.390 --> 26:21.830
Oh, you didn't know.

26:21.860 --> 26:24.830
Well, she told me.
Her Trump tweet.

26:24.870 --> 26:28.370
She's thinking
of starting her own firm.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.640
I'll be following her there.

26:31.670 --> 26:33.710
If you'll excuse me...

26:43.090 --> 26:44.150
You don't have to do this.

26:44.190 --> 26:46.090
I know.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.120
She is trying to inflame you.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.890
She's trying to get you to agree
to help her without a deal.

26:50.930 --> 26:53.200
Then I won't be inflamed,
will I?

26:53.230 --> 26:55.400
Dish-one. 11/23 - 065.

26:55.430 --> 26:58.830
Back-slash, Foxtrot, eight.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.770
Hello?

27:01.800 --> 27:04.170
It's me.

27:04.210 --> 27:05.670
I know you.

27:05.710 --> 27:07.440
Where are you?

27:07.480 --> 27:09.180
Home still.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.210
Why? I need you here.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.310
Hold on.

27:15.150 --> 27:17.120
What are you doing?

27:17.150 --> 27:18.750
Lowering my pants.

27:18.790 --> 27:20.760
No, no, not now.

27:20.790 --> 27:22.890
I'm taking you into my mouth.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.260
I'm wet.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.200
Is that Rosalie?

27:29.230 --> 27:30.700
Can you hear me?

27:32.170 --> 27:33.940
I want to fuck you so bad.

27:33.970 --> 27:35.870
I want to fuck you
right in half.

27:35.900 --> 27:38.710
I think so.

27:38.740 --> 27:41.280
Is your wife in the next room?

27:41.310 --> 27:43.310
Is Maia downstairs?

27:43.350 --> 27:44.780
Yes.

27:44.810 --> 27:46.350
Having dinner.

27:46.380 --> 27:48.420
I want them to hear you.

27:48.450 --> 27:49.890
I want...

27:49.920 --> 27:50.890
Personal edit.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.190
11/23 - 065.

27:54.220 --> 27:56.220
Back-slash, Foxtrot, eight.
Let's turn it off.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.290
No.

27:57.330 --> 27:59.190
...isn't.

27:59.230 --> 28:00.900
Little Henry misses you.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.160
I miss him.

28:03.270 --> 28:04.830
How was his birthday?

28:04.870 --> 28:05.830
He had seven friends over.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.370
Seven friends for seven years.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.740
All right, would you tell him

28:09.770 --> 28:11.170
I'm bringing my gift with me?

28:11.210 --> 28:12.780
He can't wait.

28:12.810 --> 28:14.310
Your real family is here.

28:14.340 --> 28:16.180
We're the ones who love you.

28:16.210 --> 28:17.510
I love you, too...

28:17.550 --> 28:18.980
I don't believe it.

28:19.010 --> 28:22.350
You don't believe my dad
has a secret family?

28:22.380 --> 28:24.750
This is too obviously
provocative.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.320
This was created
to hurt you,

28:26.350 --> 28:28.190
to make you react.

28:28.220 --> 28:31.230
My dad abandoned me.

28:31.260 --> 28:33.460
He also stole
billions of dollars

28:33.500 --> 28:34.930
from people who trusted him,

28:34.960 --> 28:36.970
but, what, you draw the line
at a love child?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.870
Let me make an actual deal
with Madeline.

28:42.910 --> 28:46.210
She wants you not to think,
so let's stop,

28:46.240 --> 28:48.010
take a breath, and think.
No.

28:49.410 --> 28:51.210
I'll be there in 48 hours.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.920
We can't wait.

28:52.950 --> 28:54.020
We need you.

28:54.050 --> 28:55.250
I need you.

29:00.460 --> 29:02.830
He treats me
like I'm eight years old.

29:02.860 --> 29:05.390
No, he treats you like
you're 28 years old.

29:05.430 --> 29:06.960
I know more
than he thinks I know.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.900
Marissa, he's a name partner.

29:08.930 --> 29:10.230
So why doesn't he
take me seriously?

29:10.270 --> 29:11.500
I'm offering to save him money.

29:11.530 --> 29:13.040
No, you're offering
to replace me

29:13.070 --> 29:14.370
as an investigator.
Yeah.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.870
Because I'm cheaper.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.310
And anyway, we could both
be investigators.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.340
You keep complaining
about how you're overworked.

29:20.380 --> 29:23.050
Okay, are you asking
for my opinion?

29:24.610 --> 29:27.450
No, but... yeah.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.380
Talk to him.

29:29.420 --> 29:31.250
Go sit him down
and talk to him.

29:31.290 --> 29:33.020
Tell him that you passed
your detective test last week

29:33.060 --> 29:34.520
and you'd like some
on-the-job training.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.270
Barbara.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.410
He's taking the Obama Library

29:51.440 --> 29:53.580
to a start-up, which is crazy!

29:53.610 --> 29:55.310
It's about the Reddick name.

29:55.340 --> 29:57.380
He doesn't care
how big the firm is.

29:57.410 --> 30:00.050
He's following the name
to a new home.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.080
Because of your
speech, Barbara.
He's not my client.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.520
Diane was supposed
to be with him.

30:04.950 --> 30:06.620
Wait. Wait. Wait!

30:06.650 --> 30:08.320
We need to talk to Habercore

30:08.360 --> 30:09.890
about the risks of a start-up.

30:09.930 --> 30:11.290
That...
I'll do that.

30:11.330 --> 30:12.860
He can't just expect
some small firm

30:12.900 --> 30:14.600
to handle these
presidential library issues.

30:14.630 --> 30:16.060
I'll talk to Liz.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.430
Oh, no. That'll just
make things worse.

30:18.470 --> 30:20.300
We need to talk.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.940
About what?

30:21.970 --> 30:24.070
Liz.
Oh.

30:24.110 --> 30:25.540
We need the Reddick name.

30:25.570 --> 30:27.510
No, she won't sell it.

30:27.540 --> 30:28.610
I know.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.050
Seriously?

30:37.090 --> 30:40.120
Wouldn't have to change
the letterhead.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.590
Offer her an equity
partnership?

30:42.620 --> 30:43.890
Name partnership.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.430
We were planning

30:46.460 --> 30:48.000
on paying her
a percentage anyway.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.330
He'll never go for it.

30:51.370 --> 30:52.970
They don't get along.
Yeah, well...

30:53.000 --> 30:54.670
he's one partner out of 15.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.570
If the other
partners think

30:56.600 --> 30:59.070
this is an existential threat...
Is it?

30:59.110 --> 31:01.580
Well, we've been using
the Obama Library

31:01.610 --> 31:03.950
as a selling point
for five months now,

31:03.980 --> 31:05.410
so, yes, I think it is.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.050
Well...

31:10.490 --> 31:13.090
...let's see if
Liz is open to it.

31:17.660 --> 31:20.130
Uh, could I get
a vodka tonic, please?

31:24.130 --> 31:26.400
Vodka tonic, please?

31:30.440 --> 31:32.370
What happened to my office?

31:32.410 --> 31:34.010
I took down the wall.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.440
Gives the room more space.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.980
I liked it.

31:38.010 --> 31:39.380
My office.

31:39.410 --> 31:42.150
I know.
And the, uh...

31:42.180 --> 31:43.650
the windows.

31:43.690 --> 31:45.050
They're new?
Uh, yes.

31:45.090 --> 31:46.650
Ian wanted more light.

31:46.690 --> 31:48.590
Vodka tonics.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.060
Salud.

31:54.060 --> 31:56.060
Don't get drunk, okay?

31:56.100 --> 31:58.200
Seriously?

31:58.230 --> 32:00.240
I'm just saying.

32:01.570 --> 32:04.170
You're starting your own firm?

32:04.210 --> 32:06.670
I'm thinking about it.

32:06.710 --> 32:09.110
And stealing away our client?

32:09.140 --> 32:10.680
Which client
might that be?

32:10.710 --> 32:14.020
Rod Habercore
and the Obama Library.

32:14.050 --> 32:16.420
You are such a narcissist.

32:16.450 --> 32:18.720
What, you sign a client,
and then you call him yours?

32:18.750 --> 32:22.020
Why don't you try competing?

32:22.060 --> 32:24.630
Liz, 90% of new firms fail

32:24.660 --> 32:26.230
within the first five years.
Oh...

32:26.260 --> 32:28.130
L-Look it up.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.630
It is always so good
talking to you, Adrian.

32:30.670 --> 32:34.040
You are such a ray of sunshine.

33:11.510 --> 33:13.710
Uh... Uh, one second.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.480
Maia, it's Lucca.

33:15.510 --> 33:17.680
Jay wants to show you something.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.280
Okay.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.820
What are we doing? Go ahead.

33:21.850 --> 33:25.220
11/30 - 065.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.120
Back-slash, Foxtrot, eight.
Guys, if this is another
phone call from my dad...

33:27.160 --> 33:29.260
Just wait. Wait. Listen.

33:29.290 --> 33:30.690
Hello?

33:30.730 --> 33:32.290
Hey. What are you doing?

33:32.330 --> 33:34.500
Waiting for your call.
What are you doing?

33:34.530 --> 33:37.100
I've been very busy,
but I miss you.

33:37.130 --> 33:38.230
Who is that?

33:38.270 --> 33:40.100
Take off your pants.

33:40.140 --> 33:42.070
Are you crazy?
There's people here.

33:42.100 --> 33:43.240
Who is that?

33:43.270 --> 33:44.840
That's President Trump.

33:44.870 --> 33:47.110
He called your dad
for phone sex.

33:49.180 --> 33:50.510
What?

33:50.550 --> 33:52.180
It's audio manipulation software

33:52.210 --> 33:54.520
developed by the FBI.

33:54.550 --> 33:56.150
You feed in 40 minutes
of any voice,

33:56.180 --> 33:58.650
and you can create
a conversation from scratch.

34:00.290 --> 34:02.560
Do it under your desk.
No one will know.

34:02.590 --> 34:04.690
Tell me what you're doing.

34:04.730 --> 34:05.790
I'm touching myself.

34:05.830 --> 34:07.330
What?
Wait, stop it.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.160
Oh, my God.
What do you want
your dad to say?

34:09.200 --> 34:12.600
Wait, what

34:12.630 --> 34:13.800
Uh, I...

34:13.840 --> 34:15.670
"I love you,
President Trump."
Mmm.

34:18.570 --> 34:19.740
I love you, President Trump.

34:19.770 --> 34:21.680
I love how your ass looks
in jeans.

34:23.210 --> 34:25.150
I added that.
That's nice.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.780
Wait, you created that
whole conversation?

34:29.820 --> 34:32.590
Yep. Our brave new world.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.890
Mistrust everything.

34:34.920 --> 34:36.660
Mike Pence is here, too.

34:36.690 --> 34:37.790
He wants to talk to you.

34:37.830 --> 34:39.260
I love fake Mike Pence.

34:39.290 --> 34:41.230
God, you're sexy, Henry.

34:41.260 --> 34:43.830
Tell me
what you're gonna do to me.

34:46.300 --> 34:48.300
I want to fuck you so bad.

34:48.340 --> 34:50.370
I want to fuck you
right in half.

34:50.410 --> 34:52.810
Do you have the telephone
call from Madeline?

34:55.610 --> 34:57.180
What are you doing?

34:57.210 --> 34:58.210
Lowering my pants.

34:59.310 --> 35:01.380
No, not right now.

35:01.420 --> 35:02.850
I'm taking you into my mouth.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.590
It's not Rosalie.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.690
Not... It's not her
voice. They faked it.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.620
Good.

35:09.660 --> 35:12.330
Then I have a suggestion.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.160
Liz?

35:14.200 --> 35:16.200
Have you, uh,
met Diane Lockhart?

35:16.230 --> 35:18.200
Uh, yes.
Once, I think.

35:18.230 --> 35:20.170
At a bar association dinner.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.670
That's right.
Liz, can we talk?

35:22.700 --> 35:24.210
You had a partner.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.340
Will Gardner.
I did.

35:25.370 --> 35:27.940
Yeah. Yeah, he was
a good lawyer.

35:27.980 --> 35:29.880
Beat me in a case
I should've won.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.250
Yeah. He was good that way.
Yeah.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.620
I'm so sorry about
what happened.
Yeah.

35:34.650 --> 35:35.720
And Alicia Florrick.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.350
Yes, she was
at my firm, as well.

35:37.390 --> 35:39.620
Yeah. We went to
school together.

35:39.650 --> 35:41.360
Oh. Chicago.
Mmm.

35:41.390 --> 35:42.920
It's like one big, happy family.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.630
Yeah.

35:44.660 --> 35:45.860
Liz.

35:45.890 --> 35:47.630
We want you to join our firm.

35:51.670 --> 35:53.740
In what capacity?

35:53.770 --> 35:55.670
Name partner.
Equity partner.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.640
You want my father's name?

35:58.670 --> 36:01.280
Yes. And you.

36:01.310 --> 36:02.780
We want you, of course.

36:02.810 --> 36:04.810
An ex-AUSA who was fired...

36:04.850 --> 36:06.650
Quit.
Quit.

36:06.680 --> 36:07.680
And holds a grudge

36:07.720 --> 36:08.980
against her old boss?

36:09.020 --> 36:10.390
Clients like that.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.990
Grudges sell well.
Hmm.

36:12.020 --> 36:13.660
To the guilty?

36:13.690 --> 36:15.360
And the wrongly accused.

36:15.390 --> 36:18.660
Run into many of those?

36:18.690 --> 36:20.760
Ah, you're not gonna be one
of those tiresome prosecutors

36:20.800 --> 36:23.230
who has trouble adjusting.

36:23.270 --> 36:26.800
Does-does Adrian know about
your little offer to me?

36:26.830 --> 36:28.400
No.
Yes.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.810
You two are quite
the comedy team.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.470
Uh, Mr. Boseman does not know.

36:32.510 --> 36:36.840
This would be an action taken
by the other 15 equity partners.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.710
We would outvote him.

36:39.910 --> 36:41.850
Yeah, I...

36:41.880 --> 36:43.690
I've spent the past ten
years in the bureaucracy

36:43.720 --> 36:46.290
of the DOJ. I...

36:46.320 --> 36:47.960
I don't know that I want
to trade it for another one.

36:47.990 --> 36:50.290
Well, just so you know,
we pay better.

36:50.330 --> 36:52.490
Let me think about it.

36:52.530 --> 36:53.860
We'll need to know today.

36:54.860 --> 36:57.870
Then I will tell you today.

37:04.340 --> 37:07.280
You're playing this
a little abruptly.

37:07.310 --> 37:09.810
It's what she wants.
I hope you're right.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.850
We're gonna have
to tell Adrian at some point.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.050
Yeah, we will.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.450
...was intentional.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.750
They know that the driver
was angry.

37:16.780 --> 37:18.450
Roger Hill, a local
divorce lawyer, was killed

37:18.490 --> 37:21.360
by the driver
of a blue 2012 Dodge van

37:21.390 --> 37:23.730
driving at 45 miles an hour.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.760
Police arrested
the owner of that van,

37:25.790 --> 37:28.860
Stan Greennoble, a Logan Square
real estate agent.

37:28.900 --> 37:31.870
The police found angry texts and
letters from Greennoble

37:31.900 --> 37:34.740
accusing Hill of overcharging
him for legal work

37:34.770 --> 37:37.470
and losing him joint custody
of his child.

37:37.510 --> 37:40.040
Greennoble was taken
into custody at noon

37:40.070 --> 37:41.480
outside his business,

37:41.510 --> 37:43.380
charged
with first-degree murder.

37:43.410 --> 37:44.950
Kill all lawyers!

37:44.980 --> 37:47.010
All of 'em! Kill 'em!

37:47.050 --> 37:49.480
"Kill all
the lawyers." With those words,

37:49.520 --> 37:52.350
Stan Greennoble ran down
his divorce attorney.

37:52.390 --> 37:54.360
Now a lot of lawyers here
in Chicago are asking,

37:54.390 --> 37:56.460
can overbilling get you killed?

37:56.490 --> 37:58.360
Look, I understand
the anger out there.

37:58.390 --> 38:00.030
Some of my best friends
are lawyers.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.830
But every time
one of these things happens...

38:09.540 --> 38:12.510
Funerals are hard.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.510
Yep.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.380
But they help.

38:16.410 --> 38:18.510
Another hour in here and
people will start laughing,

38:18.550 --> 38:20.350
having a better time.

38:20.380 --> 38:24.050
You can only think
about death for so long.

38:24.090 --> 38:27.090
I don't know
if that's true.

38:28.990 --> 38:32.460
You know, I have something
stronger, if you want.

38:37.830 --> 38:39.530
What?

38:39.570 --> 38:42.040
Psilocybin.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.010
I don't know what that is.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.570
It's mushrooms. It's ground
up, mixed with grape juice.

38:46.610 --> 38:48.080
Oh, it's a psychedelic.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.940
Sort of.

38:49.980 --> 38:51.580
You micro-dose it.

38:51.610 --> 38:53.850
Add an eyedropper to your drink,

38:53.880 --> 38:55.980
and everything
will be clarified.

38:56.020 --> 38:59.050
Your mind on jazz.

38:59.090 --> 39:01.160
I don't like jazz.

39:01.190 --> 39:03.930
What do you like?

39:06.460 --> 39:08.530
Russian literature.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.960
Bach.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.100
Then you will love this.

39:16.470 --> 39:18.110
How much?

39:18.140 --> 39:21.080
For you, free.

39:21.110 --> 39:22.640
I like your smile.

39:30.690 --> 39:33.520
Death and sex.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.660
It connects you to life.

39:35.690 --> 39:38.530
You know, I'm gonna wake up
tomorrow morning

39:38.560 --> 39:41.600
and realize this conversation
never happened.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.100
Diane.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.130
Do you have a moment?

39:45.170 --> 39:46.570
Uh, not really.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.200
Did you see the news
about Roger Hill?

39:48.240 --> 39:49.440
They caught the driver.

39:49.470 --> 39:50.610
Yeah, I just did.

39:50.640 --> 39:51.940
"Kill all lawyers."

39:51.970 --> 39:54.080
Killers are rarely so literate.

39:54.110 --> 39:56.210
Mm, it's awful.
But divorce lawyers

39:56.240 --> 39:58.010
bring out the
worst in people.

39:58.050 --> 39:59.150
Yeah, I guess.

39:59.180 --> 40:01.120
Um, a quick thing.

40:01.150 --> 40:03.620
I know you have no reason
to forgive me, Diane...

40:03.650 --> 40:06.050
Renee, we're good. Really.

40:06.090 --> 40:08.090
You're forgiven.
Wait, I want you to take

40:08.120 --> 40:10.690
Michael Sommers'
partnership at our firm.

40:10.730 --> 40:12.690
What?

40:12.730 --> 40:14.500
He handled
our litigation.

40:14.530 --> 40:16.900
We need a partner to
lead the department.

40:16.930 --> 40:19.200
You would be perfect.

40:22.540 --> 40:24.670
Are you all right?

40:24.710 --> 40:26.510
Uh, yes.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.640
Um, how-how did he die again?

40:29.680 --> 40:31.480
Stroke. While
horseback riding.

40:31.510 --> 40:33.050
Oh, yeah. That's right.

40:33.080 --> 40:35.180
I-I have a job, Renee.

40:35.220 --> 40:37.220
Yes, at a firm half our size.

40:37.250 --> 40:40.660
And a firm, to be frank,
that's downsizing.

40:40.690 --> 40:43.630
Trump is changing the rules
on no-bid minority contracts.

40:43.660 --> 40:45.160
That's a third
of your business.

40:45.190 --> 40:47.060
And one of your partners
is actively trying

40:47.090 --> 40:48.560
to force you out.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.230
Barbara Kolstad?

40:53.640 --> 40:55.470
Did you not know?

40:57.200 --> 40:58.940
Oh.

40:58.970 --> 41:02.280
You came back from the dead,
Diane. You proved yourself.

41:02.310 --> 41:06.210
You don't have to keep proving
yourself over and over.

41:06.250 --> 41:09.250
Come take
Michael's spot.

41:14.760 --> 41:18.730
Kill all lawyers!
All of 'em! Kill 'em!

41:18.760 --> 41:20.860
"Kill all
the lawyers." With those words,

41:20.900 --> 41:23.730
Stan Greennoble ran down
his divorce attorney.

41:23.770 --> 41:25.730
Now a lot of lawyers here
in Chicago are asking,

41:25.770 --> 41:27.900
can overbilling get you killed?

41:27.940 --> 41:29.270
Weird.

41:29.300 --> 41:32.140
Yep.

41:32.170 --> 41:34.780
Are you worried?

41:35.780 --> 41:38.750
About what,
overbilling?

41:38.780 --> 41:40.750
No, they caught him,
right?

41:40.780 --> 41:43.690
So, I guess not.

41:46.850 --> 41:48.820
I don't think
Boseman likes me.

41:48.860 --> 41:50.260
Oh, he likes you.

41:50.290 --> 41:52.260
He's just stuck
with his height.

41:52.290 --> 41:54.260
Tall people are stuck
with their height.

41:54.300 --> 41:56.930
You're tall, and you're
not stuck with your height.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.570
I hide it well.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.770
My mother would hit me
if I slumped.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.770
I want to investigate
for the firm.

42:03.810 --> 42:05.210
I think I'd be good.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.770
I've passed the PI test.

42:06.810 --> 42:07.940
Well, then tell him.

42:07.980 --> 42:09.810
I have. He ignores me.

42:11.250 --> 42:13.680
Treat it like a test.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.650
Okay, you're distracted.

42:16.680 --> 42:17.950
What's going on with you?

42:21.760 --> 42:23.960
Is Barbara trying
to force me out?

42:23.990 --> 42:26.330
No.

42:26.360 --> 42:27.900
Maybe.

42:27.930 --> 42:29.630
She's territorial.

42:29.660 --> 42:31.730
She thinks Boseman prefers you.

42:31.770 --> 42:33.200
How do you know
all this?

42:33.230 --> 42:35.940
I'm a natural investigator.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.970
Why are you worried
about Kolstad?

42:40.640 --> 42:43.810
I've been asked to be
a partner at another firm.

42:43.850 --> 42:46.250
Twice the size
of Reddick/Boseman.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.820
And you're wondering...?

42:48.850 --> 42:50.720
If I should go.

42:50.750 --> 42:53.890
The offer came from someone
who betrayed me.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.890
Well, someone who betrayed
you once will betray you again.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.830
That's a given.

42:58.860 --> 43:01.900
Yeah, but isn't it better to go
with the devil that you know?

43:01.930 --> 43:03.830
I never understood
that expression.

43:03.870 --> 43:05.600
Why not go with no devils?

43:07.300 --> 43:11.270
I just don't like hustling every
day to keep this firm afloat.

43:11.310 --> 43:14.380
Yes, you do.

43:14.410 --> 43:16.610
You love it.

43:18.810 --> 43:21.680
Have you ever taken psilocybin?

43:21.720 --> 43:22.850
Mushrooms? No.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.820
LSD, but...

43:24.850 --> 43:26.390
Is that what that is?

43:27.390 --> 43:29.720
Yes.

43:29.760 --> 43:32.990
Are you
micro-dosing, Diane?

43:33.030 --> 43:35.030
No.

43:36.930 --> 43:38.330
Maybe.

43:41.070 --> 43:45.070
Diane Lockhart, on the
cutting edge of culture.

43:45.110 --> 43:47.740
I've heard it
sharpens the mind.

43:47.780 --> 43:49.910
But maybe that's just
a rich person's way

43:49.940 --> 43:51.350
to make addiction palatable.

43:54.750 --> 43:56.350
No.
Yes.

43:56.380 --> 43:59.020
That is crazy.
We want her name.

43:59.050 --> 44:01.420
And you're fuckin' serious?

44:01.460 --> 44:03.020
We could outvote you.

44:03.060 --> 44:04.890
Oh, just try, Julius.

44:04.930 --> 44:05.890
Just try.

44:05.930 --> 44:07.800
We don't want to,

44:07.830 --> 44:09.400
but we could do it.

44:09.430 --> 44:11.430
So try.

44:15.740 --> 44:19.770
I'm quitting unless you allow me
to intern as an investigator.

44:19.810 --> 44:22.680
Can we do this another time?

44:26.080 --> 44:28.420
I've been at the firm
for one year now.

44:28.450 --> 44:30.320
That's the longest
I've worked at any one job.

44:30.350 --> 44:32.090
I've passed a PI test.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.890
I am experienced
with every firearm.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.320
I don't want to replace Jay.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.890
I want to work beside him.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.790
And I need you to decide now,

44:38.830 --> 44:40.690
or I'll work with someone else.

44:42.900 --> 44:45.130
Okay.

44:48.800 --> 44:51.440
How 'bout you work part-time
as a backup investigator?

44:52.470 --> 44:54.880
My salary plus ten percent.

44:54.910 --> 44:56.080
Hell no.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.480
You're still Diane's secretary.

44:57.510 --> 44:58.480
Assistant.

44:58.510 --> 45:01.080
Assistant.

45:01.120 --> 45:04.490
After a couple months,
maybe we can...

45:04.520 --> 45:06.950
perhaps talk about a raise.

45:09.020 --> 45:10.420
Okay.

45:10.460 --> 45:11.990
Good.

45:13.030 --> 45:15.460
Good.

45:21.170 --> 45:23.140
Okay...

45:23.170 --> 45:25.370
...what you got?

45:25.410 --> 45:28.140
Maia has information
on the location of her father.

45:28.180 --> 45:31.110
She does?
Yes. And she knows

45:31.150 --> 45:32.510
who the woman in the photo is.

45:32.550 --> 45:33.510
Oh, so you're just
now remembering?

45:33.550 --> 45:35.120
I am.
Oh.

45:35.150 --> 45:38.850
And, uh, what do you want
for this information, Maia?

45:38.890 --> 45:40.550
Full exoneration.
No prosecution.

45:40.590 --> 45:41.890
Queen for a day?

45:41.920 --> 45:43.490
No.
Why not?

45:43.520 --> 45:46.790
Queen for a day with you
always works out bad for me.

45:46.830 --> 45:50.400
Well, then, I'm going to need
a hint of what you got.

45:50.430 --> 45:53.770
The exact location
of Henry Rindell.

45:54.570 --> 45:56.400
You know it?

45:56.440 --> 45:58.540
Yes.

45:59.570 --> 46:02.140
I don't believe you.

46:02.180 --> 46:03.810
Okay.

46:05.250 --> 46:06.510
Hello?

46:06.550 --> 46:08.050
Hey, Dad. It's me.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.050
Where are you

46:10.080 --> 46:12.820
I am.
Don't worry. No one's listening.

46:12.850 --> 46:14.060
You've been in
touch with him?

46:14.090 --> 46:17.220
Maia records all
of her phone calls.
Oh.

46:17.260 --> 46:18.890
What do you need, babe?

46:18.930 --> 46:20.160
I'm afraid
they're closing in on you, Dad.

46:20.190 --> 46:22.100
The FBI is always listening in.

46:22.130 --> 46:23.200
They'll never find me here.

46:23.230 --> 46:24.830
Where's here?

46:24.870 --> 46:26.570
I can't have you tell anyone.

46:26.600 --> 46:27.970
No one will know, Dad.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.440
Did you move
from the last place?

46:29.470 --> 46:32.470
I'm back in Chicago.
Chicago?

46:32.510 --> 46:35.910
Do you know the FBI agent,
Madeline Starkey?

46:35.940 --> 46:37.180
Yes, Dad.

46:37.210 --> 46:40.050
I'm in her basement. Hold on.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.620
Maia, hey. How are you doing?

46:42.650 --> 46:44.090
Good.
Are you sure it's all right

46:44.120 --> 46:45.150
that my dad stays there?

46:45.190 --> 46:46.620
Oh, yeah.

46:46.650 --> 46:48.460
We've been having
pajama parties. It's great.

46:48.490 --> 46:50.620
Mm. Well, I'm glad
you're having fun.

46:50.660 --> 46:53.060
Oh, not as much fun
as we're gonna have at trial.

46:53.090 --> 46:55.000
I wonder what the judge will say
about you trying

46:55.030 --> 46:56.900
to trick Maia
with a faked phone call.

46:56.930 --> 46:59.600
Well, my guess is that the
judge will find that irrelevant.

46:59.630 --> 47:00.630
We'll see.

47:00.670 --> 47:02.840
Yes, we will.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.540
Hi, Renee,
I've given it some thought.
Diane, I was just heading out.

47:07.570 --> 47:10.180
Thank you for the offer,
but I think...
Oh, don't worry about it.

47:10.210 --> 47:13.580
I like the challenge of working
with Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad.

47:13.610 --> 47:15.650
That's good. Because I went
with my second choice.

47:15.680 --> 47:17.950
Your second... choice?

47:17.990 --> 47:19.920
For partner.
Barbara Kolstad.

47:19.950 --> 47:21.960
But thanks
for the consideration.

47:29.130 --> 47:33.500
* They're writing songs

47:33.530 --> 47:37.240
* Of love

47:37.270 --> 47:42.240
* But not for me

47:42.280 --> 47:49.920
* A lucky star's above

47:49.950 --> 47:52.950
* But not for me

47:52.990 --> 47:58.260
* With love to lead the way

47:58.290 --> 48:03.330
* I found more clouds of gray

48:03.360 --> 48:08.170
* Than any Russian play

48:08.200 --> 48:11.610
* Could guarantee

48:11.640 --> 48:17.140
* I was a fool

48:17.180 --> 48:21.950
* To fall and get that way

48:21.980 --> 48:24.620
* Hi-ho, alas

48:24.650 --> 48:31.030
* And also lackaday

48:31.060 --> 48:35.030
* Although I can't dismiss

48:35.060 --> 48:41.300
* The memory of his kiss

48:41.340 --> 48:44.310
* I guess

48:44.340 --> 48:49.240
* He's not...

48:49.280 --> 48:54.580
* He's not for...

48:54.620 --> 48:56.620
* Me.
