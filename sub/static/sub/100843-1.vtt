WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:05.506
(Vision Films jingle)

00:10.678 --> 00:13.214
(Wolfe jingle)

00:30.564 --> 00:33.701
(slow, serene music)

01:43.036 --> 01:45.573
- [Child] Life isn't
measured by the number

01:45.606 --> 01:47.175
of breaths we take.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.481
But by the moments that
take our breath away.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.822
(slow piano music)

02:11.399 --> 02:12.833
- [Man] FBI Los Angeles 224.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.668
This is Agent
Solomon, code 6GTM.

02:15.636 --> 02:19.006
- Yeah, it's DeRitter, 31522NG

02:19.039 --> 02:21.141
I'm gonna need a cover
for Lake Mervielle.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.644
It's located in
Northern California.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.045
I don't know how
long I'm staying,

02:25.078 --> 02:27.348
but just send it to my phone.

02:27.381 --> 02:30.318
- [Man] 10 four,
DeRitter, will do.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.626
- [Child] Marigo, Marigold?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.027
- Lake Mervielle.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.332
- [Child] It looks like
there's fish in there, mom.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.708
- [Narrator] The fall she
returned to Lake Mervielle

02:54.742 --> 02:55.909
everything changed.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.419
- [Man] What the fuck
were you thinking?

03:38.452 --> 03:39.587
You almost got yourself killed,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.322
not to mention your backup.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.358
- [Young Woman]
Please, I have a baby!

03:44.392 --> 03:45.393
- Let her go.

03:51.064 --> 03:55.135
- [Narrator] Yes, she was
running, but she had no idea

03:55.168 --> 03:58.472
why she chose to come
back here of all places.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.345
(loud shriek)

04:16.156 --> 04:17.325
- [Samantha] Holy Christ!

04:17.358 --> 04:19.627
- Oh my God, shit I'm sorry.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.428
- [Samantha] I can't
believe this is happening.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.163
- I heard a scream earlier.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.097
Was that you?

04:24.131 --> 04:25.766
- [Samantha] Just
wanted to go for a swim.

04:25.799 --> 04:26.600
Now I can't.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.101
Only time that I have.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.503
- Okay.

04:29.537 --> 04:30.604
- [Samantha] Would you mind?

04:30.638 --> 04:33.040
- Isn't it a little Autumn
for a dip in the lake?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.444
- [Samantha] Is that
any of your business?

04:38.846 --> 04:39.780
Oh!

04:39.813 --> 04:41.281
- Oh, here.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.249
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.016
Just get off me.

04:43.050 --> 04:43.984
- Okay.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.586
I just,

04:45.619 --> 04:47.788
can you tell me which one
of these god forsaken roads

04:47.821 --> 04:49.256
leads to Lake Mervielle?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.158
At our reunion last
year my college roommate

04:51.191 --> 04:53.827
told me about her
amazing rustic cabin.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.128
- [Samantha] Got an address?

04:55.162 --> 04:56.163
- Yeah.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.932
Oh, it's in the car.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.000
Do you mind?

05:00.033 --> 05:02.002
If that isn't too much to ask.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.840
- [Samantha] So who was
your college roommate?

05:06.874 --> 05:08.208
- Heather Adams.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.309
- [McKenzie] Heather?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.045
Well, quite a character,

05:12.079 --> 05:14.848
but no one's heard
from her in forever.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.619
What did you say your name was?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.489
- McKenzie Aaron, and you?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.566
- [Narrator] She remembered
her mother saying

05:32.600 --> 05:35.669
the sleepy berg was filled
with rather eccentric

05:35.703 --> 05:38.806
and colorful characters
right out of the novel.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.640
- I think that has,

05:39.673 --> 05:41.341
see that has a
little bit of a red.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.312
(knocking on door)

05:45.345 --> 05:46.346
- I got it.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.351
- [McKenzie] Hi,
I'm here for cabin keys.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.986
- Yeah, come on in.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.056
(indistinct chatter)

06:01.294 --> 06:04.197
- And you've got a few of the
new ones together over that.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.334
- [Colin] It's too
challenging for you.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.936
- Shame on you!

06:08.969 --> 06:11.872
- I'm sorry, and you are?

06:11.905 --> 06:12.706
- McKenzie.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.274
- [Colin] McKenzie.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.375
- I'm here for the
Heather Adams cabin.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.844
Property manager said they'd
leave the key with you?

06:16.877 --> 06:19.112
- [Colin] Ah yes.
- Right, I am so sorry.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.783
We were just giving Colin's
latest masterpiece a test run.

06:22.816 --> 06:23.884
Hold on one sec.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.287
- Grand Pants is famous.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.922
- Oh no, not even remotely.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.624
- He designs puzzles, look.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.125
- Wow.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.327
- First glance, it just looks
like part of the design.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.864
But when you look
closer you can see

06:36.897 --> 06:40.033
that each and every piece
has it's own little story.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.937
And it isn't until you put
all those pieces together

06:43.971 --> 06:47.040
that you can actually
see the big picture.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.776
- I used to do
puzzles with my mom

06:48.809 --> 06:50.544
but nothing like this.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.780
- My mom thinks they
are a waste of time.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.148
Like, what's the point
of sticking thousands

06:55.182 --> 06:56.817
of cardboard pieces
together, if you could just

06:56.850 --> 06:58.786
go to the store,
buy a print and frame it?

06:58.819 --> 06:59.653
- That's hardly the point.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.154
- Right?

07:01.188 --> 07:01.989
- [Woman] Here you go.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.356
- Oh thanks.
- You are welcome.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.994
- So if you need any
help getting settled in

07:07.027 --> 07:09.296
my granddaughter here
lives to be of service.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.498
- No, I've got it.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.532
Thank you.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.368
- Okay.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.108
- [Narrator] Who am I?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.944
I just happen to be the
sole writer slash editor

07:23.977 --> 07:26.680
and distributor of the
Pine Mountain Gazette,

07:26.714 --> 07:31.118
which serves all 929
readers in a 50 mile radius.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.322
Of all the stories
I've watched unfold

07:35.355 --> 07:38.325
hers is by far my
personal favorite.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.030
(slow, cheerful music)

08:10.658 --> 08:13.226
(soft humming)

08:20.400 --> 08:24.538
- Hey.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.573
Hey kid?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.375
Are you supposed to
be out here alone?

08:28.408 --> 08:29.209
Where's your mom?

08:29.242 --> 08:30.510
- Teaching, where's yours?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.515
Touch it?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.893
Soft things melt hard things.

08:51.364 --> 08:55.035
- Um,
hey I've gotta be somewhere.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.638
- I'm sorry about what I said.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.212
- Who is taking care of you?

09:05.245 --> 09:09.683
- As long as the Fabio
Ladies Book Club can see me

09:09.717 --> 09:10.684
I'm okay.

09:10.718 --> 09:14.588
My mom, she makes me
wear this just in case.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.024
One time I got lost...

09:17.057 --> 09:18.258
- Yeah, yeah I got it.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.861
Okay, I'm just gonna go and
make sure they know you're here.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.664
- Better 'cause I could be
halfway to Mexico by now.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.204
- [Narrator] She was only
here because she had promised

09:31.238 --> 09:32.740
her mother she would return.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.380
While she was a little
too city for these parts

09:40.413 --> 09:42.683
she had never broken
her word to her mom.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.785
She wouldn't start now.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.356
She had no tolerance
for patience.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.328
(serene guitar music)

10:05.372 --> 10:08.108
She thought she might
go mad from boredom.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.846
And she was sick of
this rustic cabin.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.486
She ventured into town,

10:20.353 --> 10:21.454
where the Pine
Mountain Inn served

10:21.488 --> 10:25.292
as the General Store,
Post Office and gossip central.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.696
- Hey you!

10:28.729 --> 10:30.330
- [Cass] Hey, come join us.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.199
I don't think I
caught your name.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.033
- McKenzie.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.201
But most people call me Max.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.302
- Cass.

10:35.335 --> 10:39.873
May I present Boy of a
Million Adventures, Freddie.

10:39.907 --> 10:43.476
And this one you've met
is still my mother, Adele.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.646
And that handsome
devil is Rodney,

10:46.680 --> 10:49.149
proprietor of Rodney's
Rodeo Bar and Grill.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.784
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

10:50.818 --> 10:51.952
- Lovely to meet you.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.621
- [Narrator] Within two
visits she learned Colin

10:54.654 --> 10:57.791
had been a highly revered
philosophy professor

10:57.825 --> 10:59.693
until he chucked
it all one night,

10:59.727 --> 11:02.395
moved into town,
and began to design

11:02.429 --> 11:05.198
his complex and
intricate puzzles.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.670
Widowed, he met the highly
controversial Cassandra,

11:10.704 --> 11:13.306
an anti-feminist feminist
who believed women

11:13.340 --> 11:15.408
could be insanely powerful

11:15.442 --> 11:17.377
and still be full
of grace and beauty.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.916
- Let me crash upon your shores,

11:22.950 --> 11:24.251
shipwrecking your thighs.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.685
- Promise?

11:25.719 --> 11:27.921
(giggling)

11:27.955 --> 11:29.990
- [Narrator] She quickly
came to understand why

11:30.023 --> 11:33.426
Mama Adele, founder of the Fabio
Ladies Book Club

11:33.460 --> 11:35.495
and daughter Cass,
were known to all

11:35.528 --> 11:37.664
as the Endless Bickersons.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.834
(indistinct yelling)

11:40.868 --> 11:43.837
She heard a term
called Freddie vision,

11:43.871 --> 11:45.939
but she would have no
idea what that meant

11:45.973 --> 11:46.974
until much later.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.744
(serene music)

12:08.962 --> 12:10.964
- [Child] You know what I
love more than rice pudding?

12:10.998 --> 12:14.134
- [Mother] What,
my sweet daughter?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.168
- Star Ventures!

12:17.504 --> 12:20.707
- When the last star
in the sky disappears

12:20.740 --> 12:23.110
we begin our star venture.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.813
And there is only
one rule for the day.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.516
No rules, we just go
wherever our will takes us.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.924
- [Narrator] She had
no use for nostalgia.

12:36.957 --> 12:40.460
Bristled at the cloying,
bittersweet memories.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.732
If she couldn't bury
herself in her work

12:45.765 --> 12:47.400
she would run.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.504
In any event,
grief would not best her.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.375
(gentle music)

13:07.054 --> 13:07.855
- [Man] If you go in
there, you're gonna

13:07.888 --> 13:09.056
get her killed yourself.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.791
Wait for the negotiator.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.369
- I've never seen a
mother daughter any closer

13:22.402 --> 13:23.403
than the two of you.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.139
We all loved her.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.675
She was one of a kind.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.511
But you didn't take
the time you needed.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.683
- I can see the
fear in your eyes.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.852
- I have a baby please!

13:38.886 --> 13:39.887
- Let her go!

13:41.721 --> 13:43.356
- Do you got the fucking balls?

13:46.860 --> 13:48.528
I'll fucking waste her!

13:48.561 --> 13:50.898
(screaming)

13:58.838 --> 14:02.042
(slow, dramatic music)

14:21.361 --> 14:22.362
- Do it!

14:23.030 --> 14:23.997
- You're off the case.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.032
Off doing it.

14:25.732 --> 14:29.436
90 days.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.704
(shouting)

14:36.143 --> 14:38.545
(gun firing)

14:41.548 --> 14:44.151
(serene music)

15:06.806 --> 15:08.841
- Your grief is a scraggy bitch.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.180
And she doesn't give a royal
fuck about best intentions

15:14.347 --> 15:16.849
or whether you have the
luxury of waiting her out.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.620
You've gotta find a way
through this pain, Max.

15:20.653 --> 15:21.654
Not around it.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.762
- Hey!

15:29.796 --> 15:30.797
- Hey.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.266
- Glad I caught you actually.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.268
Grand Pants wanted to know
if you wanted to come in

15:35.302 --> 15:37.837
for some full moon mud pie.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.307
- I'm not much of
a dessert person.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.608
- This is not just a dessert.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.843
This is a life
changing experience.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.178
You need to be here.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.479
He only makes it once a month.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.181
You don't wanna get FOMO.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.216
It's real.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.785
Oh and we're about to
start a new puzzle.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.454
You look like you're trying
to keep yourself busy

15:54.487 --> 15:57.157
and this is not
the place for that.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.427
- Well, I definitely don't wanna
get FOMO.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.294
- Great.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.862
We start around like seven.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.533
- All right then.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.606
- [Narrator] Colin's
full moon mud pie

16:13.640 --> 16:16.543
came from the monthly
celestial event

16:16.576 --> 16:20.547
which made the inky night
sky brilliant with stars

16:20.580 --> 16:22.915
and became the blueprint
for his puzzles.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.461
- You can start,
you don't have to wait.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.662
- Okay, thanks.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.367
Oh my God, that is so good.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.535
- Right,
I tell him he should be a chef.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.538
- My darling man.

16:45.572 --> 16:46.806
- Oh, thank you darling.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.907
- All right let's see.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.009
What have we got here?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.511
Where are we?

16:51.544 --> 16:53.480
- Mademoiselle does borders.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.348
- Yes, oui oui
mademoiselle does borders

16:55.382 --> 16:58.585
and the straight edged
pieces align themselves

16:58.618 --> 17:01.154
with earth or sky.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.489
- God, I know this.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.492
- Lost In Translation,
the James Merle poem.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.194
Every time they
start a new puzzle,

17:07.227 --> 17:08.895
they quote it like scripture.

17:10.063 --> 17:14.367
- Nothing is lost or
all else is translation.

17:14.401 --> 17:19.606
- [All] And every bit
of us is lost in it.

17:19.638 --> 17:23.976
- Um yeah,
puzzle as existential metaphor.

17:24.810 --> 17:25.712
- Right.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.012
- Go get some full moon.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.013
- Yes sir.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.582
- This is McKenzie.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.517
- Hi.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.686
- This gad fly is
Gabrielle's sister,

17:33.720 --> 17:36.689
my granddaughter who
I like sometimes.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.957
(giggling)

17:37.990 --> 17:40.260
- [Narrator] In spite of
herself she was enjoying

17:40.293 --> 17:41.294
the company.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.599
And that damn pie, it was the
best thing she'd eaten

17:46.633 --> 17:48.535
since she got there.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.838
(upbeat cheerful music)

17:57.244 --> 17:59.779
After much urging
she finally sat in

17:59.812 --> 18:01.814
on the weekly Friday
chess tournament.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.049
- Are you in?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.083
- [McKenzie] Oh.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.153
- [Freddie] Get in.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.754
- Okay, let's do this.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.358
- [Rodney] Such disappointment
is coming your way.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.026
- You don't know my chess
skills, okay?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.229
Right.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.064
- [Rodney] He's gonna whip
you like a rented mule.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.599
I'm just telling you up front.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.703
(sneaky music)

18:25.838 --> 18:26.839
He seems harmless.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.777
Like a lovely woodland
creature, but no.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.918
This is the part where
he sneaks up on you.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.321
- [Cass] No, no, no, not that.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.323
- Like a monkey in the woods.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.825
- Nice, but check mate!

18:49.962 --> 18:51.831
(laughing)

18:51.864 --> 18:53.600
- Yeah, it's humbling, isn't it?

18:53.633 --> 18:54.767
- Yes it is.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.670
- As you can see, it takes very
little stimulate us.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.938
- Yeah, but forget about that.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.839
Are you ready?

18:59.872 --> 19:01.941
- Does a polar bear
poop in the snow?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.810
- I don't know,
I did not go to college.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.213
- All right I'm getting a
jilly bar for the winner.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.781
- And don't forget the whip.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.350
- That's right,
that's the attitude.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.452
- [Narrator] They might
be quaint and slightly odd

19:12.485 --> 19:16.489
but they sure had a way
of enjoying themselves.

19:16.523 --> 19:17.490
- Oh you want some?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.392
- [Narrator] They all
seemed skilled at making

19:19.426 --> 19:21.661
the simplest occurrence
quite extraordinary.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.796
- I instantly regretted it.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.634
- And that is how it's done
here in Lake Mervielle.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.302
- [Rodney] We're
all about manners.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.003
- [Cass] We sure are.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.075
(serene music)

19:57.196 --> 19:59.999
- [Narrator] She still
ran but now she felt

20:00.032 --> 20:03.370
the cold morning
mist wash over her.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.571
And she didn't hate it.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.179
- So you understand
that this isn't a part

20:13.212 --> 20:14.947
of the original instructions?

20:14.981 --> 20:17.417
It's a cotta soul to
your father's will

20:17.450 --> 20:20.219
to be acted upon giving
certain criteria.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.690
What I'm about to tell you

20:23.723 --> 20:25.925
will certainly be counter
to what you've heard

20:25.958 --> 20:27.427
or known all these years.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.463
But it's nonetheless the truth.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.034
- Don't you just love the count

20:35.067 --> 20:38.037
even though he's a
pernicious rapscallion.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.040
- Like Rhett Butler
carrying Scarlett

20:41.073 --> 20:42.141
up those fancy steps.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.544
They don't make men
like that anymore.

20:44.577 --> 20:48.214
You think all that
is progressive.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.618
- Well afternoon,
good townspeople.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.552
I know what you're thinking-

20:52.585 --> 20:54.921
who invited George
Clooney to this affair.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.656
- Oh I did.

20:56.689 --> 20:57.490
(giggling)

20:57.524 --> 20:59.326
- Nice, no actually I'm just,

20:59.359 --> 21:01.628
thought I'd swing by,
see if you got them mixers

21:01.661 --> 21:02.462
I ordered?

21:02.495 --> 21:03.996
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.665
I'm gonna mix that up.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.566
I'll mix it right up for you.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.601
- I wish you would,
I wish you would.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.737
So, what do you say, you in?

21:10.770 --> 21:12.138
You in for some of
the best fishing

21:12.171 --> 21:14.006
you'll ever see in
anywhere in these parts?

21:14.040 --> 21:15.942
- Oh,
I think I'll sit this one out.

21:15.975 --> 21:16.776
Maybe next time.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.244
- Oh, what are you gonna do?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.413
Go home and cry about your life?

21:20.447 --> 21:21.514
So sad, boo!

21:21.548 --> 21:24.183
You're no fun, she's fun.

21:24.216 --> 21:25.952
No, I will not eat them.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.557
(whimsical music)

21:35.828 --> 21:39.165
- Kind of reading
the paper here.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.300
- What you reading about?

21:47.173 --> 21:48.174
Boo.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.546
Psst.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.381
- Do you have somewhere to be?

21:54.414 --> 21:55.415
- No.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.284
Do you know I like
cheese raviolis?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.852
Know what my mom always says?

22:01.488 --> 22:02.955
- Nope.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.957
- 'Cause I like them a lot.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.292
- I...

22:06.325 --> 22:07.126
- Like a lot, a lot.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.528
- Right.

22:08.561 --> 22:12.999
- And she also wishes that
she was a spy, like you.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.538
Hum, that looks interesting.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.073
- Well that's crazy
because I'm not a spy.

22:26.379 --> 22:27.380
Do you have somewhere to be?

22:27.414 --> 22:29.749
- Nope, nope nowhere to be.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.784
I could sit here
with you all day.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.588
If you were stranded
in the rain forest

22:35.622 --> 22:37.089
what's one item you'd have?

22:37.123 --> 22:38.525
- You stay here, I'm gonna go.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.659
- Okay.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.693
- Okay good.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.733
- She ain't coming back.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.504
* Fishing

22:51.538 --> 22:54.641
* Is for philosophers

22:57.209 --> 22:59.446
- [Rodney] Hey good luck,
gotta have good luck

22:59.479 --> 23:00.513
when you're fishing.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.114
- That's right 'cause I've
got questionable jujus

23:02.148 --> 23:04.451
so we need all the
help we can get.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.519
All right, let's roll.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.721
Oh, I have to go to
the bathroom already.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.993
(gentle music)

23:23.970 --> 23:26.072
- I don't bite, you know.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.647
Why thank you.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.293
- Hey.

23:47.326 --> 23:48.928
- Your skin's soft.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.098
- Okay, thank you.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.104
(slow piano music)

24:08.948 --> 24:09.949
Hey.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.337
Hey, you okay?

24:34.306 --> 24:35.642
Freddie?

24:35.675 --> 24:37.810
- Yeah, I'm just in it.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.047
- What?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.081
- Can't you feel it?

24:46.719 --> 24:47.820
Memorizing it.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.557
For next time.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.225
- Next time?

24:53.259 --> 24:55.662
- Like when I have to
go to the hospital.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.196
Or get my blood drawn.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.801
- You're something else.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.302
- I know.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.871
But I didn't ask to be.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.473
- Hey,
I didn't mean it like that.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.542
- Don't worry, I'm used to it.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.045
Think I don't know
what people see?

25:13.913 --> 25:15.682
Gawking at me.

25:15.715 --> 25:18.585
Their eyes are like pin balls.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.753
Look anywhere but at the dork,

25:20.787 --> 25:22.321
that's what's in their minds.

25:22.354 --> 25:26.192
But out of their mouths
were special needs.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.929
One must be PC after all.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.530
It's okay Max.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.700
I have a really good life, I do.

25:34.533 --> 25:39.538
And besides I get to know
things, feel things

25:40.640 --> 25:42.041
other people can't.

25:43.976 --> 25:47.446
Like how your heart
is so ginormous

25:47.479 --> 25:50.382
and that's why it hurts so deep.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.331
- Listen,
try not to worry, okay?

26:06.332 --> 26:07.433
- His lifeline's here.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.602
I can't get Rodney
on his cell phone.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.037
- He's a cowboy.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.639
He's got about as much
use for a cell phone

26:12.672 --> 26:13.606
as a damn donkey.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.941
- Don't defend him, Cat.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.876
- No, I'm not defending him.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.144
I'm just stating a fact.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.423
- What's the story here?

26:31.457 --> 26:32.759
- Huh?
- The story.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.530
- I mean he's smart as a
whip, this one.

26:40.499 --> 26:41.533
- Yeah but,

26:43.636 --> 26:44.637
what is it?

26:47.473 --> 26:49.175
- It's called Fanconi Anemia.

26:50.142 --> 26:54.346
It's rare as hell and
it clobbers the genes

26:54.380 --> 26:56.749
that do DNA repair.

26:56.783 --> 27:00.987
Not to mention the
seizures and the cancer

27:01.020 --> 27:03.355
just breathing down their necks.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.457
If that's not enough
of a challenge

27:05.491 --> 27:10.496
then life expectancy, tick tock.

27:11.130 --> 27:15.067
His mother, Sammy,
she's a gladiator.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.636
I've never seen her buckle.

27:17.670 --> 27:18.938
I don't know how she does it.

27:18.971 --> 27:23.710
I mean she's made out of
steel and strawberries.

27:29.682 --> 27:32.118
Want you to join us
for dinner tonight.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.619
- Oh no, thank you.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.654
- Now you need to
be with people.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.858
Cat won't take no for an answer.

27:39.826 --> 27:43.029
- Well in that case.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.531
(chuckling)

27:45.564 --> 27:48.367
- Whoa whoa whoa you got one!

27:48.400 --> 27:50.669
- You got one, there we go!

27:52.004 --> 27:53.906
Get it, get it, get it!

27:53.940 --> 27:55.808
(cheering)

27:55.842 --> 27:57.209
- Let's take it off in there.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.017
- Hey we better get your home.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.518
Okay, yeah.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.257
- That's why I didn't
eat the sandwich.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.324
- Yeah, yeah.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.926
Mom, mom, mom!

28:13.960 --> 28:15.527
- What could you
possibly be thinking?

28:15.561 --> 28:17.930
And who the hell do
you think you are?

28:17.964 --> 28:19.198
Do you have a kid?

28:19.231 --> 28:21.433
No because if you did you
would have never taken

28:21.467 --> 28:23.169
my son without my permission.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.003
- [Freddie] Mom, she...

28:24.036 --> 28:25.671
- Sammy, Sammy,
let's reel it in.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.873
- Don't even, because I know
you went to the big lake.

28:26.906 --> 28:27.706
- Well of course we did.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.041
There's no fish
in the small one.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.543
- Everyone knows no big
lake unless I'm along.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.813
Did you remember to
take his afternoon meds?

28:35.281 --> 28:37.349
What if he had a
seizure out there?

28:37.383 --> 28:38.951
- I brought them in my bag.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.188
- [Man] Oh see there you
go, no harm no foul.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.690
- No harm no foul.
- Stay out of it.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.758
- Hey Freddie, here's you...

28:45.792 --> 28:47.026
- No.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.260
- Oh come on.

28:48.294 --> 28:50.429
Sammy you can't take the fish
and his catch away from him.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.630
That wouldn't be right.

28:51.663 --> 28:53.465
- Hey, I'm really sorry

28:53.499 --> 28:55.968
but I would never hurt your son.

28:56.002 --> 28:59.638
- Mom,
Max is like crazy wonderful.

28:59.671 --> 29:02.909
She's an awesome storyteller.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.879
- Imagine that.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.247
- Let's go make some dinner.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.485
- Yeah, this party's over.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.755
- So, I called Heather today.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.591
But her phone was disconnected

29:19.625 --> 29:21.527
so I did a little digging.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.131
Ended up speaking to her mother.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.900
Heather died about
five years ago.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.602
My son always believes
the best in people

29:30.636 --> 29:33.005
but I don't suffer
from that virtue.

29:33.039 --> 29:35.441
Stay the hell away
from both of us.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.677
- You're right, and I'm sorry I
lied about Heather.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.680
But the truth is I'm
working a special assignment

29:41.713 --> 29:42.714
for the EPA.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.186
We're investigating potential
environmental threats

29:47.219 --> 29:48.154
in the area

29:48.187 --> 29:50.689
and it's classified
so we work undercover.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.025
I'm sorry for any confusion.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.264
- All right,
we'll see you later.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.066
Officer of whatever that is.

30:02.969 --> 30:07.006
- Okay it's possible I was
a little too rough on her.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.640
- Oh come on, she's a good girl.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.011
Trust me,
when have I ever led you astray?

30:12.044 --> 30:12.879
Do not answer that.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.947
Just go make my trout almandine,

30:14.981 --> 30:16.482
the way I like it.

30:16.515 --> 30:19.618
- Well if you would
behave like a grown up.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.786
- I'm trying to, but...

30:20.819 --> 30:21.787
- I could.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.489
- I've got women coming
at me like bullets.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.158
- [Gabrielle] Did mom ever get
here?

30:26.192 --> 30:28.494
- [Sasha] I have no idea.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.029
- This looks nice.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.030
- There you go.

30:31.063 --> 30:31.998
- Thank you.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.299
- She's joining us for dinner.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.666
- So sorry.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.535
You should have
started without me.

30:36.568 --> 30:39.338
(dramatic music)

30:41.840 --> 30:43.642
- That's against every
good breeding tip

30:43.675 --> 30:46.012
you've ever crammed into
our little pagan ears.

30:46.045 --> 30:46.845
- Shut it!

30:46.879 --> 30:48.180
This is our mom.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.681
Mom, this is McKenzie Aaron.

30:49.715 --> 30:50.682
- Lovely to meet you.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.584
How long have you been here?

30:52.618 --> 30:54.020
- A week.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.187
- Enjoying your stay?

30:56.122 --> 30:57.156
- Uh huh.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.658
- [Girl] McKenzie's a
really great puzzler.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.895
- Oh so they've lured you
into their little conclave.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.898
Hey, were you here
a few summers ago?

31:07.967 --> 31:08.968
- No.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.370
- You look familiar.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.541
- I'm just one of those
faces, I guess.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.877
- Yeah,
that's just so fascinating.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.213
Why don't you tell us
what you're doing here.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.249
- Oh just getting
away from it all.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.284
And yes, pointedly,
un fascinating.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.555
- Running,
that's where I've seen you.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.692
Have you run by
the big lake yet?

31:33.725 --> 31:36.262
- Yeah, I've been hiking
and running everywhere.

31:36.295 --> 31:39.198
It's some kind of
beautiful out there.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.799
- Some kind of beautiful.

31:44.636 --> 31:45.637
- Mom?

31:50.176 --> 31:53.179
- I understand you work
for the government?

31:55.447 --> 31:57.984
- Yeah,
mom used to be a congresswoman.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.618
Now she's a consultant, though.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.121
With the administration
you know,

32:02.154 --> 32:04.090
the phone's ringing
off the hook.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.125
- Yeah, not an easy gig.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.295
- Yeah, that house of cards
selling his soul shit.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.762
I thought we had a rule here.

32:10.796 --> 32:15.434
- Yeah, no iPhones or
politics at the dinner table.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.503
We get enough of
it everywhere else.

32:17.536 --> 32:18.837
- It's because it's the
latest spectator sport.

32:18.870 --> 32:22.108
Reality by stupid
America where we wait

32:22.141 --> 32:23.942
everyday with sheer
anticipointment.

32:24.843 --> 32:26.512
- Aren't you clever, Sasha?

32:26.545 --> 32:29.115
I seem to recall you
didn't show up to vote.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.617
- If people wanna know why
millennials have checked out

32:31.650 --> 32:33.419
it's because you
made us check out.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.855
With all your lies, BS,
spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.124
- [Mother] Tell us
how you really feel.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.191
- Okay, here we go.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.160
- I think if the
millennials checked out

32:41.193 --> 32:43.795
it's because we coddled
you so spectacularly.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.031
- Coddled?

32:45.064 --> 32:48.000
Jesus, you were still drinking
back then for days at a time

32:48.034 --> 32:50.536
and when I needed a
mother it wasn't you.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.371
- Stop screaming at her about
what she hasn't done right.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.972
Look at you,
what have you done right?

32:54.006 --> 32:55.007
- [Sasha] This is bullshit.

32:55.041 --> 32:57.609
- McKenzie, I'm sorry McKenzie.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.112
My girls are usually a
little more civilized.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.047
- What?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.282
(shouting)

33:03.315 --> 33:04.116
- Enough!

33:04.150 --> 33:05.351
Gabrielle, enough.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.654
I forgot.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.357
Gabrielle, come with me.

33:11.390 --> 33:12.391
Gabrielle!

33:13.259 --> 33:15.361
- [Mother] Don't sweetie.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.065
- I'm just gonna go help.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.333
- Oh my God.

33:22.734 --> 33:26.138
(indistinct chatter)

33:26.172 --> 33:29.075
(mysterious music)

33:52.298 --> 33:55.867
- [Narrator] McKenzie knew
from her years of FBI training

33:55.901 --> 33:58.837
that there were far
deeper secrets buried here

33:58.870 --> 34:00.139
than her own.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.342
* Whisky whisky whisky

34:03.375 --> 34:05.211
* That makes me feel so risky

34:05.244 --> 34:06.678
* In the core

34:06.712 --> 34:08.580
* In the core

34:08.614 --> 34:10.282
* Oh whisky whisky whisky

34:10.315 --> 34:11.917
* Makes me feel so risky

34:11.949 --> 34:15.521
* In the corner

34:15.554 --> 34:18.757
* Thine eyes are dim

34:18.790 --> 34:22.293
* I cannot see

34:22.328 --> 34:24.795
* I have A O rock

34:24.830 --> 34:27.199
* With me

34:27.233 --> 34:30.636
* I have A O rock

34:30.668 --> 34:32.904
(laughing)

34:34.306 --> 34:36.308
- I'll be back.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.411
(indistinct chatter)

34:53.659 --> 34:56.594
(slow piano music)

34:59.198 --> 35:02.334
- See, isn't this nice?

35:02.368 --> 35:04.370
You don't always have to
talk, you know.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.477
- You know what my
mom's favorite word is?

35:13.779 --> 35:16.348
- No, but I bet money
you're about to tell me.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.418
- Kintsukuroi.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.752
Know what that means?

35:20.786 --> 35:21.887
- Not even remotely.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.891
- More beautiful for
having been broken.

35:28.694 --> 35:29.695
It's Japanese.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.207
- Here.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.342
It's cold.

35:51.517 --> 35:54.553
- I know you didn't see any
reason to meet your birth mother

35:55.887 --> 35:58.123
and I assume that's in large
part because you were told

35:58.156 --> 35:59.157
she left you.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.562
But in fact that's
not what happened.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.066
(slow piano music)

36:14.873 --> 36:16.141
- [Freddie] There's
a couple ducks.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.810
- Does a one legged
duck swim in a circle?

36:18.844 --> 36:20.646
Are you beating me?

36:20.679 --> 36:23.249
- Yes, I love when you babysit
me, Gabrielle.

36:23.282 --> 36:26.452
- Ah, feeling's
mutual, little man.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.689
- Freak!

36:31.690 --> 36:34.159
(chuckling)

36:34.192 --> 36:35.661
- Don't listen to them, okay?

36:35.694 --> 36:37.195
They're jerks.

36:37.229 --> 36:40.198
- [Teen Boy] Hey,
what happened to you?

36:40.232 --> 36:42.868
- Yeah, stick your hand
in some meat grinders?

36:43.869 --> 36:44.670
- [Teen Girl] If
you guys don't stop,

36:44.703 --> 36:45.871
I'm gonna get mom.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.105
- Yeah, let's keep
playing, okay?

36:47.138 --> 36:49.541
- Hey lobster boy, get a little
too close to the lawn mower?

36:49.575 --> 36:51.743
Oh look at you crying.

36:52.644 --> 36:53.945
- [Teen Boy] Boo hoo.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.248
- Creeper creeper
why the freaker?

36:56.282 --> 36:58.350
- [Teen Girl] I'm outta here.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.951
- Three.

36:59.985 --> 37:00.919
- [Teen Boy] What a retard.

37:00.952 --> 37:01.853
I've never seen such a retard.

37:01.887 --> 37:02.888
- [Boy] Mega tard.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.325
Weirdo.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.729
(crying)

37:11.897 --> 37:12.864
- Hey!

37:12.898 --> 37:14.533
- What do you want?

37:14.566 --> 37:15.934
- What did you just say?

37:15.967 --> 37:17.469
- What do you care?

37:17.503 --> 37:19.471
- A hell of a lot
is what I care.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.139
Now listen up.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.141
You speak to anyone
like that ever again,

37:23.174 --> 37:24.310
I'm gonna find you.

37:24.343 --> 37:27.379
I'll make your sorry little
lives freaking miserable.

37:27.413 --> 37:28.814
You got that?

37:28.847 --> 37:29.915
- [Teen Boy] Fuck you!

37:32.518 --> 37:34.286
- I'm sorry, he told me to.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.787
I really didn't mean it.

37:35.821 --> 37:36.622
It was his fault.

37:36.655 --> 37:37.656
- You okay?

37:38.357 --> 37:39.157
- I didn't want to.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.459
- Then don't say it.

37:46.532 --> 37:48.133
Are you okay?

37:48.166 --> 37:50.469
- Hey, that was cool
what you did over there.

37:51.537 --> 37:54.105
Well, they won't be
bothering Freddie anymore.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.441
- No they certainly won't.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.877
Honey were those the
same kids from last year?

38:01.513 --> 38:02.514
Hey.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.318
I know that it probably
doesn't feel like it

38:07.986 --> 38:09.287
but it isn't you
they don't like.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.389
It's themselves.

38:11.557 --> 38:12.558
Okay?

38:16.628 --> 38:19.197
What do you say we go get
you two those jilly bars?

38:19.230 --> 38:20.165
Yeah?

38:20.198 --> 38:21.199
- Can Max come?

38:22.568 --> 38:25.804
- Uh, I'm sure she has
some things she has to do.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.946
Thank you for that.

38:34.980 --> 38:35.881
- You think in this day and age

38:35.914 --> 38:38.650
people would be a
little more sensitive.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.186
I don't know how you
deal with the bullshit.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.522
- Well they certainly
don't hand out a manual.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.325
I don't know,
you just learn to muddle through

38:47.359 --> 38:50.061
and hope like hell that
people become less ignorant

38:50.095 --> 38:51.597
and less angry.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.333
Less fearful of those
who look different

38:55.367 --> 38:57.503
or love different.

39:01.407 --> 39:06.177
- Freddie,
don't let them get to you, okay?

39:06.211 --> 39:07.045
They just...

39:07.078 --> 39:08.914
- See the special
needs freak show.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.181
- Hey, don't say that!

39:11.116 --> 39:12.117
Come on.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.821
You know why I think they
call you special needs?

39:15.854 --> 39:17.322
- Because I'm all that?

39:17.355 --> 39:20.926
- No, it's not you who need us.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.628
It's all of us who need you.

39:25.631 --> 39:28.033
Okay, it's true.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.036
Don't know what
I'd do without you.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.213
- Look, I promised them I'd
take them for jilly bars so...

39:43.649 --> 39:46.117
(slow music)

40:42.040 --> 40:43.875
- [McKenzie] Samantha!

40:52.317 --> 40:55.220
(slow piano music)

42:09.027 --> 42:09.928
- [News Reporter] In other news

42:09.961 --> 42:11.529
The Sister Wives just
took home a Grammy

42:11.563 --> 42:13.699
for Song of the
Year, I Don't Play.

42:13.732 --> 42:16.267
Lead singer Lisa Jane
remarked upon hearing the news

42:16.301 --> 42:18.503
that she hoped women
everywhere find inspiration

42:18.536 --> 42:19.871
in their journey.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.711
(door creaking)

42:25.744 --> 42:27.212
- Hey little man.

42:28.614 --> 42:32.217
(wheelchair motor humming)

42:37.388 --> 42:38.389
What's wrong?

42:40.892 --> 42:42.661
- Why don't you like Max?

42:45.631 --> 42:46.965
- I know what you need.

42:56.842 --> 42:59.244
(slow music)

45:54.152 --> 45:56.287
(knocking on door)

45:56.321 --> 45:57.322
- Hello?

46:00.291 --> 46:01.292
Hi.

46:02.427 --> 46:03.428
- Hi.

46:04.863 --> 46:06.297
Thanks for your
help the other day,

46:06.331 --> 46:09.400
but you're just
here for a visit,

46:09.434 --> 46:10.768
but Freddie's full time.

46:10.802 --> 46:12.503
Not a roadside attraction.

46:12.537 --> 46:15.340
So please, whatever you do

46:15.373 --> 46:16.674
don't play him.

46:16.707 --> 46:19.510
- Hey, the last thing I'm
doing is playing your son.

46:20.445 --> 46:21.746
- Shit.

46:21.779 --> 46:23.714
Look I shouldn't have said that.

46:25.016 --> 46:27.585
He's pretty damn
insistent that I give you

46:27.618 --> 46:28.619
a second chance.

46:31.823 --> 46:35.961
He's got a heart that
will overlook anything.

46:35.994 --> 46:37.829
And I just don't
wanna see him hurt.

46:39.697 --> 46:40.698
- So?

46:41.900 --> 46:44.569
- How about Saturday afternoon?

46:46.671 --> 46:47.672
- Sure.

46:52.577 --> 46:55.580
(crickets chirping)

46:59.650 --> 47:01.019
- So why puzzling?

47:05.523 --> 47:07.325
- I guess it's shown
me a whole new way

47:07.358 --> 47:09.360
to see things.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.631
It's taken me way
beyond what I thought

47:13.664 --> 47:14.900
I could comprehend.

47:16.601 --> 47:17.602
- How so?

47:18.904 --> 47:22.040
- Well none of us
are remotely capable

47:22.073 --> 47:25.176
of experiencing the
world we live in.

47:25.210 --> 47:28.079
You know, we've created
two and three dimensional

47:28.113 --> 47:30.581
boundaries just to try
to make sense of things.

47:30.615 --> 47:34.552
But what lives inside the
spaces of those boundaries?

47:35.887 --> 47:37.255
- [McKenzie] And
you're able to see that

47:37.288 --> 47:38.957
when you're puzzling?

47:40.358 --> 47:44.329
- [Colin] Well I've had some
brief glimpses when I'm deep

47:44.362 --> 47:49.500
into a puzzle and where
possibilities are limitless.

47:49.534 --> 47:54.539
It's like looking at a cloud
and seeing the face of God.

47:56.874 --> 47:57.875
- Huh.

47:59.477 --> 48:00.845
Well to puzzling.

48:00.878 --> 48:01.779
- Oh, to puzzling.

48:01.812 --> 48:04.282
- To going where no
man has gone before.

48:04.315 --> 48:05.917
- Oh yeah.

48:05.951 --> 48:07.518
Live long and prosper.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.787
(giggling)

48:10.621 --> 48:13.391
(ducks quacking)

48:14.392 --> 48:16.962
(gentle music)

49:22.727 --> 49:25.230
(baby crying)

49:42.247 --> 49:44.015
- Let me help.

49:44.049 --> 49:45.316
- You can't help.

49:45.350 --> 49:46.351
- Come on.

49:47.518 --> 49:50.255
Come on, Vivienne,
what can I do?

49:58.896 --> 50:00.365
- Take me to the nearest bar.

50:03.701 --> 50:04.702
- Come on.

50:08.039 --> 50:10.708
- McKenzie, that's not her name?

50:21.686 --> 50:22.720
- [Gabrielle] Mom?

50:33.131 --> 50:36.134
(car motor humming)

50:54.485 --> 50:55.486
- [McKenzie] Hey!

50:57.955 --> 50:58.956
Can I help?

50:59.724 --> 51:02.427
- No I just need to wait
for it to cool down.

51:02.460 --> 51:04.462
- Actually I'm pretty
handy with cars.

51:04.495 --> 51:05.496
What's the problem?

51:07.064 --> 51:10.835
- Well it needs a
new, well everything.

51:12.137 --> 51:13.604
It's just not a
priority on the list.

51:13.638 --> 51:14.739
Next to all the bills

51:16.407 --> 51:18.276
and I mean God how I thought
I could make a living

51:18.309 --> 51:20.511
being a dance teacher
out here is beyond me.

51:22.012 --> 51:23.814
- Well you got a
lot on your plate.

51:23.848 --> 51:26.050
- Look, I'm not a martyr.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.585
- Oh, that's not what I heard.

51:28.786 --> 51:30.855
I heard that you never crumble.

51:31.822 --> 51:34.525
- Oh trust me I have my days.

51:40.765 --> 51:42.333
(door slamming)

51:42.367 --> 51:43.468
- While we're waiting,

51:45.303 --> 51:46.971
why don't you tell
me about them?

51:51.108 --> 51:54.111
- And then when he was five
and we had gone through

51:54.145 --> 51:55.513
one of his surgeries,

51:55.546 --> 51:57.648
one of my old dance
friends came by

51:57.682 --> 52:00.117
and she proceeded to
tell me how everyone felt

52:00.151 --> 52:02.820
so sorry that I didn't
have a normal child

52:02.853 --> 52:05.156
and how it must
be such a burden.

52:06.191 --> 52:07.124
- [McKenzie] Oh my God.

52:07.158 --> 52:10.328
- Yeah and then I asked
her why she thought

52:10.361 --> 52:11.929
I wanted a normal kid

52:11.962 --> 52:13.598
because I didn't want
Freddie to be anything

52:13.631 --> 52:14.799
other than who he is.

52:15.866 --> 52:16.801
And then she pulled me aside

52:16.834 --> 52:18.503
and she said,
"Don't ever say that again.

52:18.536 --> 52:20.137
Makes you sound crazy."

52:20.171 --> 52:21.706
- What?

52:21.739 --> 52:22.940
- Maybe I am crazy.

52:22.973 --> 52:23.974
- No, no.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.878
- Every day Freddie
teaches me something new.

52:28.846 --> 52:32.650
I mean sure the every day
challenges can be annoying

52:36.487 --> 52:38.989
but we really are just
very happy how we are.

52:40.825 --> 52:43.661
I always say when you hug
Freddie it's like hugging God.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.898
I mean how does it get
any better than that?

52:49.867 --> 52:50.935
- It doesn't.

52:55.740 --> 52:56.707
(knocking on door)

52:56.741 --> 52:57.675
- [Freddie] It's her!

52:57.708 --> 52:58.709
Quick, open the door!

52:58.743 --> 53:01.078
- Well she's not gonna
vanish into thin air.

53:02.347 --> 53:05.082
- Gosh, this is crazy
awesome that you're here.

53:05.115 --> 53:06.351
- [McKenzie] Care
for a surprise?

53:06.384 --> 53:09.153
- Does heaven taste
like cotton candy?

53:09.186 --> 53:12.790
Mom's made the most awesome
cheese raviolis ever!

53:14.024 --> 53:15.693
We're gonna have garlic bread

53:15.726 --> 53:18.062
and for dessert some apple pie.

53:20.698 --> 53:23.167
Look mom,
this is called the Nesting Doll

53:23.200 --> 53:25.836
and it's like the
coolest thing ever.

53:25.870 --> 53:30.875
It's like seeing all the
times of a person's life

53:31.309 --> 53:36.314
and how things stay
part of you forever.

53:36.947 --> 53:38.916
Max got her first
one from her mom

53:38.949 --> 53:40.084
when she was four.

53:40.117 --> 53:43.354
And always got a new one
at Christmas and birthdays.

53:43.388 --> 53:46.424
And she has like
hundreds of them at home.

53:46.457 --> 53:48.726
- Hey, I'm not that old.

53:52.897 --> 53:56.467
- Okay, it's time for dinner
and early bedtime for you.

53:56.501 --> 53:58.068
- Can Max stay?

53:59.169 --> 54:00.405
- I don't know.

54:02.006 --> 54:03.073
Can Max stay?

54:05.976 --> 54:06.977
- I'd love to.

54:09.847 --> 54:10.848
- Yeah!

54:13.017 --> 54:15.653
(serene music)

54:29.467 --> 54:31.702
- Okay little man, time for bed.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.126
(machine humming)

55:00.531 --> 55:03.368
(machine beeping)

55:36.000 --> 55:38.002
- [Narrator] It was
only then that Max

55:38.035 --> 55:41.338
began to fully grasp
their daily challenges.

55:49.714 --> 55:53.017
- Wow,
you weren't fooling around.

55:53.050 --> 55:55.319
The monkeys.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.855
- Yeah, he collects them
like you do nesting dolls.

55:59.123 --> 56:00.658
- Why monkeys?

56:00.691 --> 56:03.828
- Well he used to love
how Curious George

56:03.861 --> 56:06.263
was always busting out and
doing things he shouldn't

56:06.296 --> 56:08.198
until that man with that...

56:08.232 --> 56:10.835
- Silly yellow hat.

56:10.868 --> 56:14.204
I say don't mock me!

56:17.542 --> 56:18.743
- That's right.

56:19.877 --> 56:23.213
- I love you the
biggest, the mostest,

56:26.116 --> 56:27.652
and the foreverest.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.622
- Mama, I love you the mostest.

56:55.680 --> 56:58.115
(door creaking)

56:58.148 --> 57:01.318
(car engine starting)

57:11.996 --> 57:14.599
(gentle music)

57:47.197 --> 57:49.967
(dramatic music)

58:19.697 --> 58:20.965
- Hi.

58:20.998 --> 58:23.033
- You had one, didn't you?

58:23.067 --> 58:24.368
- No, no.

58:25.335 --> 58:26.336
- Mom.

58:28.272 --> 58:30.708
- Okay, but I'm fine.

58:32.176 --> 58:34.244
Look, more importantly,
how are you?

58:34.278 --> 58:37.081
'Cause I know those kids
were back at the lake.

58:37.114 --> 58:38.649
- No mom.

58:38.683 --> 58:39.850
Max took care of that.

58:42.286 --> 58:43.954
- You've been very
quiet all night long.

58:45.289 --> 58:50.294
- It's like when I have to go
to my place at the hospital

58:51.862 --> 58:54.665
and you know I have to be there

58:54.699 --> 58:56.867
until it's okay I can, right?

58:59.804 --> 59:00.805
- Yeah sweetie.

59:01.739 --> 59:03.307
Is that where you've been?

59:07.377 --> 59:10.848
- Well McKenzie
does the same thing.

59:10.881 --> 59:13.383
She has to go to
her place a lot.

59:15.319 --> 59:16.453
A lot, a lot,

59:17.321 --> 59:19.223
because she hurts crazy awful.

59:21.125 --> 59:24.962
And she doesn't have someone
helping her feel safe.

59:53.624 --> 59:55.793
* Steel on velvet

59:55.826 --> 59:58.162
* Silk on stone

59:58.195 --> 01:00:01.431
* Sun worn leather

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:03.200
- I'll be right back.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.009
Looks like someone's been busy.

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:13.143
- I didn't wanna be rude, but...

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:14.745
- Well you were the other night.

01:00:14.779 --> 01:00:15.746
Left without saying goodbye.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.182
- Yeah I wasn't feeling
well, sorry.

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:19.850
- Look, I'm not sure I buy that.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.888
I'm not sure what
to think actually.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:27.958
Freddie says you were just sad

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:32.062
and I will bet on Freddie
every single time.

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:42.172
- To monkey man.

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:48.112
* You in my arms

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:50.347
* Breathless and sure

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.316
* A barefoot ballet

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.185
* On a bare hardwood floor

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:58.155
* So much it seems

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:01.959
- So if Freddie's right,

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.327
what are you so sad about?

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.330
- I'm not sad, I'm just tired.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.366
- Okay look I'm not
trying to intrude.

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.635
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:12.669
- Thank you?

01:01:15.706 --> 01:01:17.908
- Yeah,
for making my son so happy.

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:22.246
I don't think I have
ever seen him light up

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:24.014
the way he does
when you're around.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:30.354
- Well he's freakily
awesome kid.

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:34.058
Maddening at times, but...

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.535
* You in my arms

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:47.872
* Breathless and sure

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.706
* Barefoot ballet

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.342
* On a bare hardwood floor

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:53.377
- Whoo!

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.224
Hey,
I'm a pretty great listener.

01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:13.530
- I...

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.965
(crowd applauding)

01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:16.466
- [Singer] Thank you,
I've got something

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.968
for all you lovers out there.

01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:18.869
- I should be going.

01:02:18.903 --> 01:02:19.703
- I'll take you home.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.006
- No, no, no I've got a car.

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:29.079
(upbeat country music)

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.982
- What,
two for the price of one?

01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:33.750
How'd I get so lucky?

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.886
Come on, let's go kick the
shit out of some dancing.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.888
Ever seen this one dance?

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:39.423
Uh oh, you're in for a treat.

01:02:42.827 --> 01:02:46.030
(upbeat country music)

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.594
- Hey Rodney,
we have to go change the keg.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:20.164
- Oh,
all right dance by yourself.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:39.716
(gentle music)

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:18.855
- Hey, have you decided yet?

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:22.359
Look, you gotta order something.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:25.862
- Okay, you know what, a scotch.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:26.696
Double.

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.298
- You sure you
wanna go that way?

01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:31.035
All right.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.029
* Open up your
heart and feel it *

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:03.633
* Love is here today

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.302
* Even I can find a way

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.938
* Find a better place
for love to stay *

01:05:07.972 --> 01:05:10.140
* Open up your eyes and see it

01:05:10.174 --> 01:05:13.310
* Love is here today

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:21.451
- Your mother didn't choose
to cut you out of her life.

01:05:21.485 --> 01:05:23.954
That was your father's decision.

01:05:23.988 --> 01:05:25.990
You father was a dear friend.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:28.792
I watched him agonize
over this decision.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:32.196
(serene music)

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:37.634
- [Girl] Thanks Mommo, I love
it.

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:40.304
- [Mother] Oh my baby bobo.

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:42.506
You're getting so big.

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:44.108
- [Girl] Not big enough.

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:46.343
I can't wait to grow up
and become a policeman

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:47.611
just like daddy.

01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:50.981
- You don't want to grow up too
fast, sweetie.

01:05:51.015 --> 01:05:53.317
Once you've done it,
there's no going back.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:07.397
(slow jazzy music)

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:20.477
- So do you have
to work tomorrow?

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.112
How are those kids?

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:23.380
- Kids are big.

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:33.723
- Samantha!

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:42.199
Hey, Samantha, Samantha!

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:44.534
- Do you always
cut out on people

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:46.303
without any explanation?

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.971
- No, of course not.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.639
- Really McKenzie?

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:51.075
I don't know what to think.

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:54.578
Something about you
is just not right.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:55.512
Something is off.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:56.913
I don't know...

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:57.747
- My mother died.

01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:58.648
- What?

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:00.350
- Last night, a year ago.

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:02.219
And I just, I lost it.

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:05.989
And no,
I'm not one to cut out on people

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.024
so I want to apologize.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.631
- Come with me.

01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:26.610
(slow jazzy music)

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:28.712
- My gun was in my
pocket the whole time.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:31.915
- I don't know how
you put up with it.

01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:33.717
- Yeah, I don't know.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:48.698
- [Woman] This isn't what I do.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:51.735
- What you do to
forget or in general?

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.005
- Both.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:07:58.975
Beckett, it's me.

01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:02.579
Listen I need you to
do something for me.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.152
- So tell me about her.

01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:49.058
- She was, she was the
only person I ever trusted.

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:51.328
In everything.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.663
You know I used to
get teased a lot

01:08:54.698 --> 01:08:58.502
about being adopted but I
couldn't have been loved more

01:08:58.535 --> 01:08:59.868
by anyone else.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.140
She was...

01:09:13.317 --> 01:09:15.018
- My dad used to
bring me up here.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:20.290
So if I ever need
to clear my head,

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:21.725
this is where I come.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:25.828
- You've never mentioned him.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:26.895
Does he live here?

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:32.202
- He died when I was 23

01:09:32.236 --> 01:09:35.639
so I know what it's
like to lose a parent

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.673
that shaped you.

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.309
It's still so fresh for you.

01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:40.344
- Yeah.

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:42.879
I am sorry about your dad.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.883
- Don't be, he was amazing.

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:51.888
But when he passed I
sort of bottomed out.

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:55.191
I stopped dancing.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:10:00.196
Ended up with Derek and
got pregnant within months.

01:10:01.965 --> 01:10:04.668
Something was wrong
with the pregnancy.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:05.969
We just didn't know what.

01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:08.905
But the moment that he was born

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.975
everyone pushed for a DNR,

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:17.514
so they administered
the morphine

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:18.882
and took him off the vent.

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:24.454
And when they put
him on my chest

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:28.292
my heart broke in
two million pieces.

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:33.196
He was so fragile.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.099
If there's a hell on this earth

01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:38.502
it's trying to
help your baby die.

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:47.711
I just held him and I prayed

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.679
and I told him it
was okay to go.

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:52.949
Whatever he needed.

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:55.952
Derek, he left the hospital.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.287
Said he couldn't be there.

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:02.426
Where are you?

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:04.461
And I felt like I was
in a horror movie.

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:11.200
It's so surreal just waiting
and waiting for him to pass.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:18.174
I need you,
I can't do this alone.

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:22.045
But he just kept
breathing and living.

01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:29.786
Derek, the doctors,
my friends, everyone

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:33.457
they'd already given up on him.

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:35.425
What are you saying?

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:39.028
It's too hard for
you to watch him die?

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:42.366
I spent 135 days in the NICU.

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:46.670
We will never ever
come back from this.

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:49.172
I'm done.

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:55.945
135 days of strong babies dying

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:57.481
and weak babies living.

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:01.985
And it was all so arbitrary.

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:08.091
You know it made me realize

01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:12.962
motherhood is not
an entitlement.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:15.499
It's a sacred privilege.

01:12:15.532 --> 01:12:18.101
So you damn well better
bring it and don't complain.

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:23.306
My God, I'm sorry.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.842
We came up here to help you

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.844
and off I go on this rant.

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:28.945
- Are you kidding me?

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:33.349
Thank you, thank you for sharing
that with me.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.530
(serene music)

01:13:07.551 --> 01:13:09.586
- You don't have
to be sad anymore

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:12.722
because you have us now.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.391
We are merged.

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:19.563
- Is he okay?

01:13:20.664 --> 01:13:21.665
What is merged?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.470
- He merges the people
he loves into his soul.

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:30.006
Very few get that honor.

01:13:32.576 --> 01:13:33.577
- I am honored.

01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:38.114
Please excuse my ignorance,

01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:42.886
but when does he
need the wheelchair?

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:46.089
- Well when he's completely
well he doesn't need it at all,

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:50.426
but when he's really sick
we use it to conserve

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.461
his energy.

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:01.605
- So does he have any
contact with his dad?

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:03.873
- None.

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:06.710
- Anyone else since?

01:14:09.713 --> 01:14:11.948
- It's one thing to
date a single mom.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:16.019
Quite another when you add
a wheelchair to the mix.

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:17.621
- How's that?

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:19.789
- Well imagine every
night you come home,

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:22.592
the first thing we talk
about is Freddie's day.

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:26.329
Doctors visits,
test results, therapy.

01:14:26.362 --> 01:14:29.633
Or maybe you finally
fit in that tennis game

01:14:31.735 --> 01:14:34.470
and I'm blowing up your
phone all day with texts

01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:35.505
from the ER.

01:14:37.741 --> 01:14:39.809
Forget anyone else's
needs getting met

01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:43.813
because my priority is the
Freddie channel 24 seven.

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:48.251
Don't I sound like
a perfect catch?

01:14:51.655 --> 01:14:52.756
- I don't play tennis.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.226
(dramatic music)

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:10.239
- Not that fast.

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:12.208
I thought I'd get him home.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:13.242
- Oh sure, sure.

01:15:19.716 --> 01:15:23.519
- Hey, would you like
to join us for dinner?

01:15:25.789 --> 01:15:28.491
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:29.659
I just have to drop by my cabin,

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:31.027
but then I'll be there.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.061
Say seven?

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.197
- Yeah.

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:43.973
(phone vibrating)

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:48.444
- Hey Beckett,
were you able to match it?

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:51.280
Oh good, yes yes,
send it to me right away.

01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:55.785
(slow music)

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:06.329
Oh fuck.

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:14.871
- How can I help you?

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:18.374
- What is your
best bottle of red?

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.276
- You don't wanna know.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.746
But I happen to have some
of my private reserve

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:27.083
for folks with
discriminating tastes.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.117
Be right back.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:33.322
(indistinct chatter)

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.230
- Of all the gin joints.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:42.265
- Vivienne.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.533
It's kind of a shocker huh?

01:16:48.638 --> 01:16:53.276
- Buck, can I get two
shots of your best scotch?

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:54.778
- Oh no, I don't want...

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:56.680
- No, no, it's okay Buck, yeah.

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:02.485
Pretty remarkable
coincidence if you ask me.

01:17:03.653 --> 01:17:06.589
- My mother used to
bring me here as a kid so

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.291
coincidence dispelled.

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:09.959
- I know who you are McKenzie.

01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:13.763
- Okay, who am I?

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:16.065
- You're a Quantico rock star.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.504
Although you're off at present
for disciplinary action.

01:17:21.537 --> 01:17:23.907
And I'm sorry about your mother.

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:26.843
But I have to ask
myself why is it

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:29.879
that we are both vacationing
in this little town

01:17:29.913 --> 01:17:31.881
that I've made my second home?

01:17:31.915 --> 01:17:33.783
So who are you working for?

01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:35.184
And what is it that you want?

01:17:35.218 --> 01:17:37.887
- You saw for
yourself I'm on leave.

01:17:37.921 --> 01:17:41.624
And what happened 10 years ago
is nobody's business, okay?

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.459
So if you'll excuse me,

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.627
I'm running late.
- I want you to stay away

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.029
from my family.

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:48.631
I still have some sway
with your director

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.067
and I can make things very
uncomfortable for you.

01:17:53.202 --> 01:17:55.038
- I'll do whatever
the hell I please.

01:17:59.843 --> 01:18:02.946
(indistinct chatter)

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:09.853
His little hair is sticking up.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.455
It's killing me.

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:20.696
Jesus, he's burning up.

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:27.570
- I was afraid he was
coming down with something.

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:30.139
I'm gonna go get some Tylenol.

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:33.877
(slow music)

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.290
- Seriously, fucking ridiculous.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:03.907
- Oh no I've got him.

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:11.680
Let's go.

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:38.041
Do you need to take him in?

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:42.979
- Unfortunately his
immune system is shot.

01:19:43.012 --> 01:19:44.447
Every time he goes
in the hospital

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.115
he catches something even worse.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:50.586
And I've had plenty of
practice breaking these fevers.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.788
Look I'm sure you
have other things

01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:53.823
you need to get to.

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:55.825
- Not a chance.

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:00.663
- Mom, mom!

01:20:01.865 --> 01:20:03.799
Where's... what are you doing?

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:05.835
- Get over here quick
and shut the door.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:11.841
- FBI?

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:13.776
- Forget that.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:14.777
How do they know each other

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.445
and what the fuck
is she doing here?

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:18.781
- They probably just know
each other through work.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.149
Mom was on the
intelligence committee.

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:21.885
Couldn't they have
just met there?

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.523
- Gabrielle, look at this photo.

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:29.792
And try not to be a
fucking Disney princess.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.327
What do you see?

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.662
It's like she just
can't help herself.

01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:35.498
Wonder what else
she hasn't told us?

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:40.904
(machine beeping)

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:48.111
- These are the nights
that I'm haunted.

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:52.848
I can't stand to think
of him suffering and...

01:20:52.882 --> 01:20:55.351
- Hey hey, he wants to be here.

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:57.786
He's made that very clear.

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.390
What can I do, what do you need?

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:04.860
- Get me out of my head.

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.831
Tell me more about your mother,

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:10.233
the way that you do Freddie.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:18.841
- Okay, we would go on
these star ventures.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:19.842
- Star ventures?

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:20.843
- Yeah.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:24.347
We would get up in the
morning with the stars

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.949
and I'd get in the car

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:27.883
and then go on an adventure.

01:21:29.052 --> 01:21:30.954
No rules, no shoulds,

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:35.558
and we would have the best
time you could ever imagine.

01:21:39.062 --> 01:21:40.964
When I was like six or seven

01:21:40.997 --> 01:21:42.498
she started this tradition

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:46.569
where we would go
around the table

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:50.473
and mama would ask
what was the best thing

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:52.541
that happened to you today.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:55.244
And the worst.

01:21:55.278 --> 01:21:59.182
Or if this was your
last day on earth

01:22:00.316 --> 01:22:01.317
what would you do.

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.820
And she would wrap it up with,

01:22:06.689 --> 01:22:08.691
what did you learn
about yourself today.

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:15.598
- So, what did you learn
about yourself today?

01:22:18.801 --> 01:22:20.469
- That my greatest mom on earth

01:22:20.503 --> 01:22:22.471
may have to share her title.

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:34.883
- I think his fever's
finally breaking.

01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:46.662
- You belong to us.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:49.465
- I'm here.

01:22:50.233 --> 01:22:52.968
I'm not going anywhere.

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:54.070
Love you, monkey man.

01:23:03.146 --> 01:23:04.847
- [Girl] Wait a
minute, what's this?

01:23:08.851 --> 01:23:11.320
- You know what, maybe we found
enough dirt on her

01:23:11.354 --> 01:23:12.155
for one day.

01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:13.689
Do we really wanna...

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:14.657
- Don't buckle now.

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:15.691
Open it.

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:19.662
(mysterious music)

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:38.514
- How do you do it?

01:23:40.116 --> 01:23:42.185
Keeping him well,
the constant stress.

01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:46.122
- Dancing.

01:23:46.889 --> 01:23:49.125
Wait, isn't that the
definition of irony?

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:55.198
How absolute freedom
of movement saves me

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:58.701
from the way that he's
trapped inside his body.

01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:02.305
If I didn't have
dance, I don't...

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:06.709
You could...

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:10.779
The couch is comfortable,
it's so late.

01:24:10.813 --> 01:24:13.316
- Oh no, I'm fine thank you.

01:24:14.617 --> 01:24:17.320
And thank you for
sharing your son with me.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.389
- Yeah.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:24.059
- Hey, are you okay?

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:27.930
- I don't know why I'm crying.

01:24:27.963 --> 01:24:29.432
- No, it's been a hell
of a stressful day.

01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:31.134
- No, it's not that.

01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:38.507
It's just, well no one
has ever been like you are

01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:40.743
with Freddie, and...

01:24:46.449 --> 01:24:49.352
(slow piano music)

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:07.303
- It's okay.

01:25:34.029 --> 01:25:37.533
- Oh my God, I don't know why,

01:25:37.566 --> 01:25:38.967
I just was...

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:42.865
(dramatic music)

01:28:39.548 --> 01:28:42.885
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:30:08.671 --> 01:30:11.640
(slow piano music)

01:30:44.507 --> 01:30:45.508
- Oh my God.

01:30:46.509 --> 01:30:47.843
It goes so long.

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:50.846
I thought forget the
passion ever existed.

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:03.692
(sneaky music)

01:31:11.534 --> 01:31:13.636
- Did you and mom
have a sleepover?

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:16.972
- Uh hi.
- Hi!

01:31:17.005 --> 01:31:18.741
We did,
like you and Kyle do sometimes.

01:31:20.042 --> 01:31:21.009
How about some orange juice

01:31:21.043 --> 01:31:22.477
and I'll make my
special pancakes?

01:31:22.511 --> 01:31:23.979
- Can we have
another one tonight

01:31:24.012 --> 01:31:25.981
and we can all watch a movie?

01:31:26.014 --> 01:31:29.117
- You know what,
I would love that

01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:31.186
but right now I've gotta run.

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.020
- Bye.

01:31:32.054 --> 01:31:33.055
- Oh bye.

01:31:37.159 --> 01:31:40.328
So what's the deal with Rodney?

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:42.230
- Are you jealous?

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:47.335
He's my uncle, my dad's brother.

01:31:47.369 --> 01:31:48.470
That's how we ended up here.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:49.872
- Are you kidding me?

01:31:49.905 --> 01:31:50.906
Oh my!

01:31:53.008 --> 01:31:54.142
Okay, okay.

01:31:54.176 --> 01:31:55.578
- Better?

01:31:55.611 --> 01:31:56.612
- Yeah, yeah.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:00.348
Hey,
I need to tell you something.

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:05.453
- Yeah?

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:11.426
Oh my God, we're gonna be late.

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:13.696
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:16.198
- You know what,
never mind, it can wait.

01:32:16.231 --> 01:32:17.032
- You sure?

01:32:17.065 --> 01:32:18.066
- Yeah.

01:32:19.968 --> 01:32:23.105
- Have you ever tried
these little pig navels?

01:32:23.138 --> 01:32:24.506
(giggling)

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:25.440
They're really good.

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:27.175
- [Freddie] I wanna try one.

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:29.277
(indistinct chatter)

01:32:29.311 --> 01:32:31.513
- Hi everyone, sorry we're late.

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:32.447
- [Colin] Better
late than never.

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.782
Never late's better.

01:32:33.816 --> 01:32:35.851
- Max, these are the Pinchot's.

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:38.120
- Yeah, we've all met.

01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:39.087
- Apparently?

01:32:39.121 --> 01:32:41.256
- Yeah, we're all practically
family now.

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:42.257
- Oh that's right.

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.292
Your cabins are only a
few down from Colin's.

01:32:44.326 --> 01:32:46.528
- Yeah, maybe you should go.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:47.763
This looks like a family thing.

01:32:47.796 --> 01:32:49.197
- Max, Max.

01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:50.232
- Max!

01:32:51.233 --> 01:32:52.234
- Don't be shy now.

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.203
- [Colin] Max, come have a seat.

01:32:55.237 --> 01:32:56.805
- I need you here with me.

01:32:56.839 --> 01:32:59.608
(indistinct chatter)

01:32:59.642 --> 01:33:01.043
- I'd like to make a toast.

01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:02.077
- Oh yes.

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:06.081
- To my beautiful daughter.

01:33:06.114 --> 01:33:10.285
My loving, lovable,
tightly wound,

01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:11.654
complex daughter.

01:33:11.687 --> 01:33:13.822
You're not as young
as you used to be.

01:33:13.856 --> 01:33:16.258
But you're not as old
as you're gonna be.

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:18.827
Happy birthday, we love you!

01:33:18.861 --> 01:33:21.163
- Happy birthday.

01:33:21.196 --> 01:33:22.631
- Thanks dad.

01:33:22.665 --> 01:33:24.099
- Happy birthday.

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:27.803
- [Rodney] That was terrible.

01:33:27.836 --> 01:33:28.837
- Oh thanks.

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.342
- So,
how do you all know each other?

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:37.312
- Max goes fishing with us

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:39.581
and she's pretty good at
chess, too.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:44.452
And she tells crazy
awesome stories.

01:33:44.486 --> 01:33:45.420
(laughing)

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.455
- That is fascinating.

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:51.293
You just make friends
all over the place.

01:33:51.326 --> 01:33:53.628
- Max is more than just a
friend, Miss Vivienne.

01:33:53.662 --> 01:33:56.198
Max and mom are like
Rodney and Cass.

01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:58.901
You know,
friends with benedicts.

01:34:00.068 --> 01:34:01.003
- Okay.

01:34:01.036 --> 01:34:02.037
- I beg your pardon?

01:34:04.006 --> 01:34:05.007
- That's not exact.

01:34:06.208 --> 01:34:07.009
- Make me feel pretty.

01:34:07.042 --> 01:34:09.611
- Well, cat's out of the bag.

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:11.279
- [Rodney] Well
who can blame me.

01:34:11.313 --> 01:34:12.647
- Here's to the young couple.

01:34:12.681 --> 01:34:14.349
- [Cass] I'm getting in on that.

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:16.651
(laughing)

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:20.388
- And when Max
stays over tonight

01:34:20.422 --> 01:34:24.693
we're all gonna watch a
movie, right mom?

01:34:24.727 --> 01:34:25.794
- Yes.

01:34:25.828 --> 01:34:28.130
- Well happy fricking
birthday mom.

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:29.698
- I am not gonna
let this happen.

01:34:29.732 --> 01:34:33.368
I suggest that you
leave, Agent DeRitter.

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.803
- Agent what?

01:34:34.837 --> 01:34:35.637
- What are you talking about?

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:37.405
- Your friend here, she's FBI.

01:34:37.439 --> 01:34:38.741
She's been here spying on me

01:34:38.774 --> 01:34:40.342
because of the
upcoming hearings.

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:42.477
I've read her file,
she's dangerous.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:43.912
That's what she's doing.

01:34:43.946 --> 01:34:45.413
- That's not, that's not...

01:34:45.447 --> 01:34:46.414
- Vivienne, calm down.

01:34:46.448 --> 01:34:47.916
- I'm not gonna calm down.

01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:49.251
She's been suspended.

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:50.652
She uses people.

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:51.586
- Sam?

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:52.420
- Mom?

01:34:52.454 --> 01:34:53.255
- She's always on the make.

01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:54.189
You have to leave now!

01:34:54.222 --> 01:34:55.991
- Mom!
- Vivienne!

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:58.126
Calm down now.

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.064
- Mom, it's starting.

01:35:04.399 --> 01:35:06.334
- I'm right here with
you, you're safe.

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:07.369
Get me my bag.

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:10.873
I'm right here baby.

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:13.708
- Freddie?

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:19.714
- Okay.

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:27.990
Okay, okay, breathe
in, breathe in.

01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:35.798
- It's okay baby.

01:35:35.831 --> 01:35:36.832
- Max.

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:38.967
- Hey monkey man.

01:35:39.001 --> 01:35:40.135
- Max.

01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:41.103
- Hey monkey man.

01:35:41.136 --> 01:35:42.470
- I need to get him home.

01:35:42.504 --> 01:35:46.909
- Okay yeah,
let's get him out of here.

01:35:46.942 --> 01:35:49.111
Let's get him out of here.

01:35:49.978 --> 01:35:50.779
- Leave him alone.

01:35:50.813 --> 01:35:52.480
- I'm going to
get going as well.

01:35:54.349 --> 01:35:55.617
- You couldn't just
leave, could you?

01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:56.684
I told you!

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:01.456
- Hey, hey, hey,

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:02.724
please just call me and
let me know how he is.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:03.758
- Move!

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:05.493
- Sam!

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:07.462
- I knew this was gonna happen.

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:09.664
She just couldn't listen.

01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:11.033
- Who are you?

01:36:11.934 --> 01:36:13.268
And all this time I
was protecting you

01:36:13.301 --> 01:36:15.270
thinking Sasha was
too hard on you.

01:36:15.303 --> 01:36:17.739
- I don't have time for
whatever Sasha has fed you.

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.808
- The truth, the truth, mom!

01:36:19.842 --> 01:36:21.609
- Before we become
judge and jury

01:36:21.643 --> 01:36:23.912
maybe you ought to listen
to some facts here.

01:36:23.946 --> 01:36:25.080
- Or more tedious excuses.

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:26.414
- Okay, both of you,

01:36:26.448 --> 01:36:27.782
enough, sit down.

01:36:29.684 --> 01:36:31.453
Go on Viv,
I'll take care of this.

01:36:31.486 --> 01:36:32.487
Go on.

01:36:36.892 --> 01:36:39.661
(dramatic music)

01:37:19.201 --> 01:37:22.570
- Your mother didn't choose
to cut you out of her life.

01:37:22.604 --> 01:37:24.206
That was your father's decision.

01:37:24.239 --> 01:37:25.908
He gave your mother
chance after chance

01:37:25.941 --> 01:37:28.610
but she just couldn't
pull it together.

01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:30.845
And then when you were two,

01:37:30.879 --> 01:37:32.915
she passed out while
you were in her care.

01:37:32.948 --> 01:37:35.617
She quite literally lost you.

01:37:36.551 --> 01:37:39.121
(child crying)

01:37:40.555 --> 01:37:41.856
And then a neighbor spotted you

01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:43.525
wandering down a busy street.

01:37:44.726 --> 01:37:47.095
That was the last your
mother ever saw of you.

01:37:47.129 --> 01:37:48.997
- [Woman] So why are you
telling me all this now?

01:37:49.031 --> 01:37:51.366
- 'Cause of this counsel
to your father's will.

01:37:52.634 --> 01:37:54.937
I was directed to share
this information with you

01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:59.341
when you turned 25 or
when you got pregnant.

01:37:59.374 --> 01:38:02.444
He wanted you to
meet your mother.

01:38:02.477 --> 01:38:04.179
(knocking on door)

01:38:04.212 --> 01:38:06.982
(dramatic music)

01:38:13.321 --> 01:38:15.657
(screaming)

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:21.796
- I don't understand.

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:33.908
So does that make
her our sister?

01:38:33.942 --> 01:38:35.077
- Half sister.

01:38:37.812 --> 01:38:39.081
And Freddie's our nephew.

01:38:40.182 --> 01:38:41.783
- Forgive me for staring.

01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:48.456
I'm just trying to take you in.

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:51.026
- That makes two of us.

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:53.428
- Samantha, it's McKenzie.

01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:54.496
Can you just call me?

01:38:58.333 --> 01:38:59.401
It's me again, I'm sorry.

01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:00.935
Can you please just call me.

01:39:00.969 --> 01:39:02.337
I'm going crazy.

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:05.673
- Your mother tried to
do everything she could

01:39:05.707 --> 01:39:09.544
to mend fences during
Samantha's pregnancy.

01:39:10.478 --> 01:39:13.315
They even began to forge a
really nice relationship.

01:39:14.382 --> 01:39:15.717
- What happened?

01:39:16.551 --> 01:39:19.687
- Well things blew apart
when Freddie was born.

01:39:19.721 --> 01:39:23.425
- I need you,
I can't do this alone.

01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:25.160
- I want to honey.

01:39:25.193 --> 01:39:27.329
I'm just not strong
like you are.

01:39:28.496 --> 01:39:32.734
- We will never,
ever come back from this.

01:39:35.337 --> 01:39:36.338
I'm done.

01:39:37.072 --> 01:39:38.540
- Take me to the nearest bar.

01:39:42.877 --> 01:39:45.547
- Well she didn't hear from
Samantha for seven years.

01:39:46.681 --> 01:39:51.653
As Freddie grew older he began
to ask if he had any family.

01:39:52.487 --> 01:39:54.689
- Is that why we
feel so close to him?

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:55.723
- Maybe.

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:59.161
Or maybe you just can't
help but feel close to him.

01:40:04.666 --> 01:40:07.802
- Why mom,
why didn't you tell us?

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:10.738
- This really was up to
Samantha to share with you.

01:40:10.772 --> 01:40:14.542
After all she didn't have
to make contact with me.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:17.145
- Whatever.

01:40:17.179 --> 01:40:20.014
- Sasha, I know that you
wanna be angry with me

01:40:20.048 --> 01:40:21.616
to cover up your hurt.

01:40:23.118 --> 01:40:27.255
And yes, I have made such
a mess of so many things.

01:40:27.289 --> 01:40:30.425
I am trying, I really am.

01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:32.994
And I can't even ask
you to meet me halfway

01:40:33.027 --> 01:40:36.764
because I know that I have
to earn your trust back again

01:40:36.798 --> 01:40:37.899
over time,

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:43.004
but right now I need to
go and make sure that

01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:45.407
Freddie and Samantha are okay.

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:53.515
- Samantha, please just let
me know that Freddie's okay.

01:40:53.548 --> 01:40:56.618
I know you're upset,
but I can explain.

01:40:57.652 --> 01:40:59.187
And there's something
I need to tell you.

01:40:59.221 --> 01:41:01.723
But I can't do this
over the phone.

01:41:10.732 --> 01:41:13.335
(alarm beeping)

01:41:35.190 --> 01:41:36.424
- Can you watch him?

01:41:36.458 --> 01:41:37.425
- What?

01:41:37.459 --> 01:41:39.294
- I need to run to the
pharmacy to pick up

01:41:39.327 --> 01:41:40.328
his seizure medication.

01:41:40.362 --> 01:41:41.796
- Oh sure.

01:41:41.829 --> 01:41:43.365
- Okay, I'll be right back.

01:41:48.803 --> 01:41:49.804
- Miss Vivienne?

01:41:50.538 --> 01:41:51.539
- Yes honey?

01:41:52.274 --> 01:41:54.909
- You and I have
a lot in common.

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:55.943
- How's that honey?

01:41:57.712 --> 01:41:59.314
- We only get one day at a time.

01:42:01.816 --> 01:42:06.053
So we've gotta make
each one count.

01:42:11.459 --> 01:42:14.162
(knocking on door)

01:42:14.196 --> 01:42:15.630
- Your mother must have
forgotten her keys.

01:42:15.663 --> 01:42:16.898
I'll be right back, okay?

01:42:28.676 --> 01:42:30.312
What are you doing here?

01:42:30.345 --> 01:42:32.614
I thought I made
myself perfectly clear.

01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:33.681
- What are you doing here?

01:42:33.715 --> 01:42:35.283
- I am here to help my daughter

01:42:35.317 --> 01:42:38.152
and so help me God,
you stay away from her.

01:42:39.821 --> 01:42:41.155
- What?

01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:42.790
What are you talking about?

01:42:42.824 --> 01:42:44.192
- My daughter, Samantha.

01:42:44.226 --> 01:42:46.828
I have just gotten
her back into my life

01:42:46.861 --> 01:42:48.296
and the last thing I
am gonna let you do

01:42:48.330 --> 01:42:49.831
is hurt her.

01:42:49.864 --> 01:42:52.500
- No, no, no way.

01:42:52.534 --> 01:42:55.703
- I am just building a
relationship with her

01:42:55.737 --> 01:42:58.406
and it would be destroyed
if she finds out.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.307
- She has to know, Vivienne.

01:42:59.341 --> 01:43:00.174
I'm not gonna lie to her now.

01:43:00.208 --> 01:43:02.244
- What the hell
is going on here?

01:43:02.277 --> 01:43:03.311
- It's nothing.

01:43:03.345 --> 01:43:05.480
We knew each other
from years ago.

01:43:05.513 --> 01:43:07.982
- No, someone is gonna
tell me what's going on.

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:09.251
- It shouldn't have happened.

01:43:09.284 --> 01:43:10.352
- McKenzie?

01:43:10.385 --> 01:43:11.586
- [Vivienne] I was drunk honey.

01:43:11.619 --> 01:43:13.355
- No, that's enough mom!

01:43:18.626 --> 01:43:19.627
McKenzie?

01:43:21.963 --> 01:43:22.964
- We were lovers.

01:43:29.637 --> 01:43:32.374
(dramatic music)

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:35.477
- I want you both out.

01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:38.112
- Sam.
- Now.

01:43:38.145 --> 01:43:39.381
I said now!

01:43:42.984 --> 01:43:46.187
- Sam, I am so sorry,

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:47.589
but I can't take this back.

01:43:47.622 --> 01:43:49.924
It was 10 years ago.

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:52.026
- Why her of all people?

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.027
Why didn't you say something?

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:54.296
- It only lasted a week

01:43:54.329 --> 01:43:57.465
and how could I know
that she was your mother?

01:43:57.499 --> 01:43:59.434
I was in D.C.
for the Fallen Heroes Memorial

01:43:59.467 --> 01:44:03.305
and we were both wasted
and in so much pain.

01:44:03.338 --> 01:44:04.238
- Spare me, spare me.

01:44:04.272 --> 01:44:06.474
I know pain,
that's what this life is.

01:44:06.508 --> 01:44:08.109
It's filled with pain.

01:44:08.142 --> 01:44:09.477
It doesn't play fair.

01:44:09.511 --> 01:44:10.445
It kicks you in the gut

01:44:10.478 --> 01:44:12.980
but you don't have the
luxury of self pity

01:44:13.014 --> 01:44:14.416
or to go out and get wasted

01:44:14.449 --> 01:44:17.251
because you have a sick
child to take care of.

01:44:17.285 --> 01:44:18.486
And every minute has to count

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.755
because it can all go
away in a heartbeat.

01:44:20.788 --> 01:44:22.457
- Hey, look at me.

01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:23.958
Look at me, please.

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:25.960
You don't have to be a
rock every single day

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:29.096
and you don't have
to do this alone.

01:44:29.130 --> 01:44:30.365
Okay, you don't.

01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.268
I don't know who I'm more in
love with, you or your son.

01:44:34.302 --> 01:44:35.970
But I swear to you.

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:37.339
- What?

01:44:37.372 --> 01:44:38.773
Swear to me what?

01:44:38.806 --> 01:44:39.607
- That I'm in this!

01:44:39.641 --> 01:44:40.642
I'm in.

01:44:41.376 --> 01:44:42.477
A thousand percent.

01:44:43.445 --> 01:44:46.213
- Today, maybe tomorrow.

01:44:48.282 --> 01:44:51.252
You have no idea what it's like

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:53.388
to play with an expiration date.

01:44:59.827 --> 01:45:01.496
Watching,
watching the days go by

01:45:06.868 --> 01:45:11.305
and the more days you
get, all expired.

01:45:13.808 --> 01:45:16.043
And you will simply
expire along with it.

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:21.115
(crying)

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:22.784
Stop now!

01:45:22.817 --> 01:45:24.318
We can't afford the time

01:45:24.352 --> 01:45:26.087
to see if you're
telling the truth.

01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:29.056
Especially with
your track record.

01:45:30.558 --> 01:45:31.559
So leave.

01:45:32.827 --> 01:45:34.729
Please leave.

01:45:46.374 --> 01:45:49.343
(slow piano music)

01:46:13.034 --> 01:46:15.202
- [Narrator] It was a year later

01:46:15.236 --> 01:46:17.038
when McKenzie got the call.

01:46:25.947 --> 01:46:26.981
- [McKenzie] Vivienne?

01:46:28.650 --> 01:46:30.485
- Thanks for
agreeing to meet me.

01:46:34.388 --> 01:46:35.757
I guess things didn't
turn out the way

01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:37.291
either one of us wanted.

01:46:38.893 --> 01:46:39.894
- So why am I here?

01:46:42.664 --> 01:46:45.700
- Because I needed
to see your face

01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:49.136
when I tell you how
deeply sorry I am

01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:50.805
for all the trouble I caused.

01:46:52.273 --> 01:46:53.941
I just got my year's chip.

01:46:53.975 --> 01:46:55.643
Hopefully this
time it will take.

01:46:57.411 --> 01:46:58.412
- Good for you.

01:46:59.514 --> 01:47:02.083
- I moved us all permanently
up to Lake Mervielle.

01:47:02.116 --> 01:47:04.686
So that we could be near
Samantha and Freddie.

01:47:06.287 --> 01:47:07.321
That little boy.

01:47:09.857 --> 01:47:12.093
If we all had one tenth
the courage he has.

01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:18.299
- Sounds like one
big happy family.

01:47:30.712 --> 01:47:32.146
- They need you McKenzie.

01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:57.672
- [Freddie] Dear Max,

01:47:57.705 --> 01:48:00.842
gosh I've missed
you crazy awful.

01:48:00.875 --> 01:48:01.876
So does mom.

01:48:03.177 --> 01:48:04.946
She may not say it out loud

01:48:04.979 --> 01:48:06.180
but like I told you,

01:48:07.381 --> 01:48:08.883
I can feel things.

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:13.454
I know things got a little
messed up last fall.

01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:15.823
And everyone made mistakes.

01:48:15.857 --> 01:48:19.493
But I kind of think mistakes
are like birthday candles.

01:48:19.527 --> 01:48:21.128
The more you have to blow out

01:48:21.162 --> 01:48:22.997
just means the
wiser you've become.

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.334
(laughing)

01:48:27.368 --> 01:48:30.037
Kind of like my mom's favorite
word, Kintsukuroi.

01:48:31.673 --> 01:48:33.608
We all got a little
broken last year.

01:48:34.776 --> 01:48:38.179
But from the broken we
can become beautiful.

01:48:40.281 --> 01:48:42.584
(laughing) (indistinct chatter)

01:48:42.617 --> 01:48:44.085
- My mom says she's
sorry she can't be here,

01:48:44.118 --> 01:48:45.286
but have a great trip.

01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:48.723
- And you can't go without
some full moon pie.

01:48:54.295 --> 01:48:55.997
- Hey, send postcards.

01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:58.465
- Oh yes and text
from everywhere.

01:49:03.938 --> 01:49:06.207
(cheering)

01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:11.278
(dramatic music)

01:49:11.312 --> 01:49:12.313
- Max!

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:16.784
- You ready for your
first star venture?

01:49:16.818 --> 01:49:19.120
- Does a pole beat jilly bar?

01:49:19.153 --> 01:49:21.188
- I don't know.

01:49:21.222 --> 01:49:24.191
- Star venture numero uno!

01:49:24.225 --> 01:49:26.460
(cheering)

01:49:31.833 --> 01:49:35.269
- [Narrator] 12
incredible years passed.

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:38.940
And I watched their love grow
stronger and more intimate

01:49:38.973 --> 01:49:39.974
each day.

01:49:40.808 --> 01:49:43.577
Not that there weren't
challenging times

01:49:43.611 --> 01:49:46.580
but they weathered them
with grace and dignity.

01:49:47.815 --> 01:49:50.584
In between the illnesses
we all made sure

01:49:50.618 --> 01:49:54.221
we lived each day like
it might be our last.

01:49:54.255 --> 01:49:58.292
Max now fully understood that
making the simplest things

01:49:58.325 --> 01:50:01.162
become special,
was the secret to being

01:50:01.195 --> 01:50:02.797
inside of life.

01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:05.299
Not just a bystander.

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:06.533
- I love you monkey man.

01:50:07.368 --> 01:50:11.038
- [Narrator] I loved her
with everything in me.

01:50:12.306 --> 01:50:15.810
We had a plan to convince
mom to have another child.

01:50:17.478 --> 01:50:19.213
Because I knew she
would want that.

01:50:21.048 --> 01:50:22.817
Because I know things.

01:50:27.655 --> 01:50:29.657
If you could tell
me that I could stay

01:50:29.691 --> 01:50:31.558
a nesting doll forever,

01:50:32.626 --> 01:50:36.163
bundled in my shell of
handmade fairytale flesh,

01:50:37.865 --> 01:50:39.133
I might consider staying.

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.309
But I have grown very tired.

01:50:52.646 --> 01:50:54.215
I am full of peace.

01:50:56.884 --> 01:50:58.686
And it's their time now.

01:51:20.107 --> 01:51:23.010
(slow theme music)

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.191
(upbeat drumming music)
