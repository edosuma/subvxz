01:00.000 --> 01:00.465
Hey.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.400
Oh, hi. Look at you.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.364
- Hi.
- Oh, sorry i'm wet. I'm-

01:04.400 --> 01:06.300
I'm-I'm sorry to make
you drive in this.

01:06.335 --> 01:07.600
It sounded urgent.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.800
It's really good
to see you.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.900
It's been forever.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.000
Johnny, what's-
What's goin' on?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.000
It's about matthew.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.365
Benton?

01:18.400 --> 01:19.700
He's dead, emily.

01:20.900 --> 01:25.000
I- I didn't wanna
tell you over the phone.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.900
How?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
His parents said that
he had a heart attack.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.900
I'm, uh-I'm sorry.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.600
Had you seen him?

01:39.635 --> 01:40.600
Yeah.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.050
A couple of times.

01:42.085 --> 01:43.342
And how was he?

01:43.377 --> 01:44.600
He was matthew.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.900
He was rambling,
a little chaotic.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.650
He was using.

01:48.685 --> 01:49.700
I don't know.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.400
Probably.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.700
There's something
you're not telling me.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.600
The last time i saw him,
there was somethin' different.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.800
He was talkin' crazy,
but the, uh-

02:07.200 --> 02:11.000
The fear-I can't quite explain
it- But i know it was real.

02:11.035 --> 02:12.165
Wh-What was he saying?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.700
He said, "johnny,
they're gonna kill me."

02:14.735 --> 02:15.717
Who's "they"?

02:15.752 --> 02:16.700
He wouldn't say.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.565
He said they
already murdered

02:17.600 --> 02:19.650
A guy from georgetown
named tommy "v"

02:19.685 --> 02:21.492
And made it look
like an accident.

02:21.527 --> 02:23.265
Do you know anyone
named tommy "v"?

02:23.300 --> 02:26.800
No. Look, he's probably
just being paranoid,

02:27.200 --> 02:30.100
But with what you do
for a living now...

02:30.300 --> 02:30.865
Yeah. Yeah.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.500
I mean, you're one of the only
people he ever trusted, emily.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.000
Ok.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.300
My lord, it's kitties
and poodles out there.

02:54.335 --> 02:55.765
Did you hear it
might even snow?

02:55.800 --> 02:58.200
Were you able to find
anything on tommy "v"?

02:58.235 --> 03:00.565
If by chance you mean
thomas valentine, age 35,

03:00.600 --> 03:03.500
Found dead in his home from
dehydration, as a matter of fa-

03:04.000 --> 03:05.100
What's going on?

03:05.135 --> 03:06.165
Is hotch still here?

03:06.200 --> 03:07.400
Oh, i'm pretty sure
he lives here.

03:07.435 --> 03:08.900
Thanks, garcia.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.100
What's wrong?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.100
Um...

03:21.900 --> 03:23.500
I just found out
that...

03:24.500 --> 03:26.400
An old friend
of mine died.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.600
I'm sorry.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.500
Do you need
to take some time?

03:33.700 --> 03:35.000
Um...

03:38.800 --> 03:42.500
There's a chance that he
could have been murdered,

03:42.800 --> 03:45.100
And there might be
a second case.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.765
What do you need?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.200
Just some leeway
to check it out.

03:49.235 --> 03:50.017
Of course.

03:50.052 --> 03:50.800
Anything

03:51.800 --> 03:53.100
Thank you.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.100
Emily, if you wanna
take a few days

03:55.135 --> 03:56.600
And let us
look into it...

03:59.500 --> 04:01.200
Matthew was...

04:02.300 --> 04:03.765
Incredibly messed up,

04:03.800 --> 04:06.400
And i hadn't seen him
in a long time,

04:07.700 --> 04:09.500
But he was
important to me.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.500
At least let us help.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.399
Thank you.

04:51.535 --> 04:54.800
<i>Criminal minds 4x17
"demonology"</i>

05:22.300 --> 05:23.665
Leonardo da vinci said,

05:23.700 --> 05:27.100
"He who does not punish evil
commands it to be done."

05:27.135 --> 05:28.300
Thanks for
coming in early.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.465
Where's morgan
and prentiss?

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
They're at the morgue
examining this man,

05:31.535 --> 05:32.965
Matthew benton,
a friend of emily's.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.500
She believes that his death
may be connected to that man's.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.300
Thomas valentine.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.900
Dehydration?

05:39.400 --> 05:40.265
Did she know him?

05:40.300 --> 05:43.300
No, but benton seemed to think
that someone was after both of them.

05:43.335 --> 05:44.365
Wait. One death
was a heart attack.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.100
The other was from dehydration.
What's the connection?

05:47.135 --> 05:48.467
I don't know
if there is one.

05:48.502 --> 05:49.765
Are the police
investigating?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.100
No. Right now, we're just,
uh, helping a colleague.

05:52.135 --> 05:53.565
So we talk
to the families,

05:53.600 --> 05:55.600
See if there's
anything suspicious.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.800
- Is emily ok?
- I don't know.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.700
That's why i sent morgan
to go with her.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.300
I'm scared.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
Don't worry.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.600
It'll be all right.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.200
Hold my hand?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.300
Always.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.900
Is it possible someone could
have induced the heart attack?

06:28.935 --> 06:30.417
The easiest way
to stop the heart

06:30.452 --> 06:31.976
Is an injection
of potassium.

06:32.011 --> 06:33.500
I would have
found traces.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.665
There's
no other way?

06:34.700 --> 06:37.700
I suppose it's possible he could
have been injected with epinephrine.

06:37.735 --> 06:39.765
It wouldn't register,
because clinically,

06:39.800 --> 06:42.400
It's identical to the
natural adrenalin in the body.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.200
Was he tied?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.700
The wounds are superficial.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.900
Anything else
out of the ordinary?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.000
He bled heavily
from his nose,

06:50.035 --> 06:51.800
But with the damage
to his septum,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.300
My guess is that it was prolonged
abuse of cocaine or methamphetamine.

06:55.335 --> 06:56.165
- Yeah.
- And what about

06:56.200 --> 06:58.200
The other autopsy,
thomas valentine?

06:58.235 --> 06:59.465
He died of dehydration.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.600
There were traces of prescription
antipsychotics in his system.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.300
I understand from his family he
had a history of mental illness.

07:05.335 --> 07:06.365
Are these
ligature marks?

07:06.400 --> 07:07.950
Considering
the self-Inflicted wounds

07:07.985 --> 07:09.500
And the history
of mental illness,

07:10.000 --> 07:11.465
The police didn't
suspect foul play.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.500
So you have 2 bodies
with ligature marks-

07:14.535 --> 07:15.965
Each superficial.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.165
But you just
dismiss them?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.800
There's no medical reason
to connect these deaths.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.950
I don't understand
why the f.B.I.

07:28.985 --> 07:30.565
Is interested
in our son's death.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.350
We were investigating
another death recently

07:32.385 --> 07:34.100
Under similar circumstances,
and we just wanted

07:34.135 --> 07:36.100
To make sure that there's
no connection.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.000
He suffered
a heart attack.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.665
It's just routine.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.500
Well, there's nothing routine
about investigating a heart attack.

07:42.535 --> 07:43.900
Andrea, it's ok.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.200
I assume your investigation
is drug-Related.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.400
We're just trying
to rule out foul play.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
May we come in?

07:55.700 --> 07:56.900
Of course.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.750
When i came
in the house,

08:05.785 --> 08:07.100
I found him here
in bed.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.850
You two don't
live together?

08:08.885 --> 08:10.500
I'd taken the kids
to my mom's.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.300
We'd been gone
a few weeks.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.300
The doctor said he must have
been in bed for days.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.900
May i ask why you took the
children somewhere else to live?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.765
My husband
was hearing voices.

08:21.800 --> 08:25.400
He was cursing god.
I needed to protect them.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.800
Of course.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.800
Do you believe
in the soul?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
I do.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.299
Well, i believe tommy's
is finally at peace.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.500
Do you mind my asking if you've
been burning incense?

08:42.534 --> 08:45.300
After matthew died, i
burned some in the room

08:45.800 --> 08:46.765
To cleanse it.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.000
So he was living
here with you?

08:49.800 --> 08:52.000
We were hoping he could
turn his life around.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.965
We were in new york
for the weekend,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.600
And when we came back,
we found his body here.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.300
My son's soul was
in the possession of evil.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.250
Do you have
any experience

09:05.285 --> 09:06.500
Dealing with
drug addiction?

09:06.800 --> 09:08.065
We see a lot of it
through our work.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.500
Well, it's an impossible thing to
watch happen to someone you love.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.750
Were you aware that in
the days before he died,

09:13.785 --> 09:15.800
Matthew thought someone
was going to kill him?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.200
Where did you hear that?

09:18.500 --> 09:20.700
One of our team members,
agent prentiss.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.100
Emily prentiss?

09:23.135 --> 09:24.165
Yes, ma'am.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.800
She's the reason
you're here?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.500
We'd like you both
to leave.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.600
Now.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.965
I- I told you
not to mention me.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
You didn't say it'd
get us kicked out.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.800
Is there something
we should know?

09:45.100 --> 09:47.500
Matthew and i met
in rome when we were 15.

09:47.535 --> 09:49.100
My mom was posted there.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.000
His parents didn't
like us hanging out.

09:51.035 --> 09:52.767
And they still
hold a grudge?

09:52.802 --> 09:54.500
They were
extremely religious.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.300
They thought i was
a bad influence.

09:56.335 --> 09:58.200
- You?
- Yeah.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.300
And that's it?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.100
That's it.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.300
We saw scuff marks on the floor
underneath thomas valentine's bed,

10:09.335 --> 10:13.200
Almost as if someone had been
tied up and struggled to get free.

10:13.235 --> 10:15.700
We saw the exact same
marks in matthew's bedroom.

10:15.735 --> 10:16.665
Has anybody
been able to find

10:16.700 --> 10:18.700
Any connection at all
between benton and valentine?

10:18.735 --> 10:19.765
According
to my snooping,

10:19.800 --> 10:21.765
Both matthew benton
and thomas valentine

10:21.800 --> 10:26.100
Traveled to galicia, spain,
over the same week 4 months ago.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.500
That mean anything to you?

10:27.600 --> 10:28.365
No.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.065
I did the quick
guidebook thing.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.465
There's a church there,
santiago de compostela.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.300
It's visited by over 100,000
religious pilgrims every year.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.367
Did his parents
say anything

10:36.402 --> 10:37.400
About him going
on a pilgrimage?

10:37.435 --> 10:38.765
No, the opposite,
actually.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.800
His mom said his soul
was possessed by evil.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.565
- Yeah.
- What?

10:43.600 --> 10:44.900
Matthew had
a thing about

10:44.935 --> 10:46.200
Challenging
the church.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.800
He could
push it.

10:48.100 --> 10:48.965
When we were
in high school,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.865
His mom and dad
consulted a priest

10:50.900 --> 10:52.565
Because they were
afraid he was possessed.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.100
But i think in this case,
she was talking about drugs.

10:55.135 --> 10:56.400
Are you sure?

10:56.500 --> 10:57.865
There's
a pattern here-

10:57.900 --> 11:00.150
The talk about evil
and the soul

11:00.185 --> 11:02.400
And scuff marks
on the floor.

11:02.435 --> 11:03.065
What are you driving at?

11:03.100 --> 11:05.700
Well, drug addiction
and schizophrenia

11:05.900 --> 11:07.850
Are 2 afflictions
most likely

11:07.885 --> 11:09.592
To present as
demonic possession.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.463
You think these
were exorcisms.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.300
I think it begs
the question.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.600
Look, i know the bible
just as well as anyone,

11:15.635 --> 11:17.267
But i also know
there's nothing more open

11:17.302 --> 11:18.900
To behavioral interpretation
than religion.

11:18.935 --> 11:20.065
Meaning what?

11:20.100 --> 11:21.800
I think it's dangerous
for us to wanna find

11:21.835 --> 11:23.917
A connection
between these deaths.

11:23.952 --> 11:25.965
Wait. Was thomas'
wife religious?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.900
She was concerned that he
had been cursing god.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.965
Exorcism ritual can
take days to complete.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.700
It's possible the stress induced
could cause a heart attack,

11:34.735 --> 11:36.600
Especially in someone
with a history of drug use.

11:36.635 --> 11:38.717
That would explain
the timeline

11:38.752 --> 11:40.800
Of someone dying
of dehydration.

11:40.835 --> 11:41.665
Guys, look,

11:41.700 --> 11:44.065
I'm willing to say that
we might have an unsub

11:44.100 --> 11:47.300
Who ritualizes killings as
if they were exorcisms, maybe,

11:47.900 --> 11:49.700
But right now, we don't even
know if we have a crime yet.

11:49.735 --> 11:50.765
Morgan's right.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.250
We need to step back.

11:52.285 --> 11:53.665
Let me talk to someone

11:53.700 --> 11:56.600
Before i have us all
telling ghost stories.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.800
You know, they count
all that stuff, jimmy.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.800
Heh heh.
Hey, stranger.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.050
I know. It's been too long.

12:12.085 --> 12:13.765
So maybe after we speak,

12:13.800 --> 12:15.800
You'll let me
take your confession?

12:15.835 --> 12:17.400
Gonna strong-Arm me?
Heh heh.

12:17.435 --> 12:18.500
You bet.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.300
So, how can i help you?

12:22.300 --> 12:24.800
What do you know
about exorcisms?

12:26.700 --> 12:29.200
Well, they're, uh-
They're controversial.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.200
The vatican issued
a new exorcism rite in 1999,

12:34.235 --> 12:37.367
So nobody
speaks out against it,

12:37.402 --> 12:40.001
But if pressed,
not every priest

12:40.036 --> 12:42.600
Believes in
demonic possessions.

12:43.200 --> 12:43.965
Do you?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.300
Let me put it this way.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.100
You believe
that evil exists.

12:48.100 --> 12:48.665
I've seen it.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.900
So if children
are born innocent,

12:50.935 --> 12:53.100
At what point
does evil enter them?

12:54.900 --> 12:56.865
How common
are exorcisms?

12:56.900 --> 12:59.600
Conservatively, i'd say
400 or 500 a year.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.200
Has anyone died in one?

13:01.400 --> 13:02.665
What's this about, davey?

13:02.700 --> 13:05.300
I'm looking into
the deaths of 2 men.

13:05.335 --> 13:06.565
Both were troubled.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.800
Each recently had made the same
pilgrimage to galicia, spain.

13:10.835 --> 13:13.317
Each died within
the last 2 weeks.

13:13.352 --> 13:15.800
And why do you
suspect exorcism?

13:15.835 --> 13:17.600
Well,
it's just a theory.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.800
One of our agents
knew one of the men.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.200
She was afraid there
might be some foul play.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.200
You agree?

13:24.500 --> 13:27.700
Would you know if one
took place here in d.C.?

13:27.735 --> 13:29.700
If it's sanctioned,
probably.

13:29.735 --> 13:30.700
If not?

13:30.900 --> 13:33.800
Well, then it's not
a true exorcism.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.100
Thanks, jimmy.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.600
David, the agent,

13:42.100 --> 13:44.800
Did the information about
the case come to her directly?

13:44.835 --> 13:45.365
Why?

13:45.400 --> 13:49.600
You open yourselves up to
understanding the worst monsters,

13:49.800 --> 13:52.700
And you invite evil
into your lives.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.200
It's a vulnerable
position.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.600
Meaning what?

13:57.300 --> 13:58.700
Take good care of her

13:59.100 --> 14:00.100
And you.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.450
Are you ok, buddy?

15:01.485 --> 15:02.600
I'm getting out.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.500
We're not even
halfway there.

15:04.535 --> 15:05.900
I'm getting out.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.100
Hey, man,
close the door!

15:18.100 --> 15:20.100
Holy virgin of virgins...

15:23.200 --> 15:25.550
...all holy angels
and archangels,

15:25.585 --> 15:28.392
All the orders
of blessed spirits,

15:28.427 --> 15:31.200
St. John the baptist,
st. Joseph...

15:43.100 --> 15:44.800
How the hell did you
get in here?

15:44.835 --> 15:45.965
I'm here to help you.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.600
Get the hell
out of here.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.650
I cast you out,
unclean spirit...

15:49.685 --> 15:51.265
I said get the hell
out of here.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.565
Along with every
satanic power of the enemy...

15:52.600 --> 15:54.865
- Do not lay hands on me.
- Every specter from hell...

15:54.900 --> 15:57.600
- Do not lay hands on me!
- In the name of our lord jesus christ.

15:57.635 --> 15:59.100
Get your hands
off me!

16:08.400 --> 16:09.650
Garcia got a call.

16:09.685 --> 16:10.865
38-Year-Old white male

16:10.900 --> 16:13.200
Found dead in his bed
by his fiancée.

16:13.235 --> 16:14.100
What's the connection?

16:14.135 --> 16:15.065
She ran the name.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.965
Patrick cavanaugh was
in galicia, spain,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.300
The same week as thomas
valentine and matthew.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.700
- Do you know him?
- No.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.065
Hey. F.B.I.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.150
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

16:23.185 --> 16:24.165
What can you
tell us?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.000
Uh, white male,
been dead for hours.

16:26.035 --> 16:27.800
Medics think it was
a brain aneurism.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.300
You mind if we take
a look at the scene?

16:29.400 --> 16:30.500
Knock yourselves out.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.565
This is kind of startin' to
freak me out a little bit.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.400
Let's figure out if we have a
crime before we start freakin' out.

16:45.435 --> 16:46.900
Obviously we have a crime.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.900
Prentiss, how does an
unsub induce an aneurism?

16:48.935 --> 16:50.665
Uh, could be
caused by stress.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.365
Yeah, like if you were
restrained on a bed

16:52.400 --> 16:55.200
While someone tried to banish
the devil from their body.

16:55.235 --> 16:57.500
All i'm sayin' is i
think we should go easy.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.400
Can i help you?

17:03.300 --> 17:04.700
We're with the f.B.I.
We're investigating

17:04.734 --> 17:07.599
A serious
of unexplained deaths.

17:07.635 --> 17:08.765
I don't understand.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.300
Uh, had patrick been
acting erratically lately?

17:12.335 --> 17:13.700
He had
a brain condition.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.250
He was getting
headaches,

17:15.285 --> 17:16.565
Wasn't acting
like himself.

17:16.599 --> 17:19.849
Were you aware of a trip he
took recently to galicia, spain?

17:19.885 --> 17:23.099
Uh, there's a church there
called santiago de compostela

17:23.135 --> 17:24.599
We think he
may have visited.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.900
My fiancé|traveled a lot
for work.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.600
I don't know
everywhere he went.

17:28.635 --> 17:29.465
With all due respect,

17:29.500 --> 17:31.900
Ma'am, i don't think
you're telling us the truth.

17:32.700 --> 17:33.600
Excuse me?

17:34.700 --> 17:36.700
Did you believe
patrick was possessed?

17:36.735 --> 17:38.465
I'd like
some privacy, please?

17:38.500 --> 17:40.300
Was someone trying
to rid him of demons?

17:40.335 --> 17:42.165
- Is that how he died?
- No.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.000
You really believe
he had a brain condition?

17:44.035 --> 17:44.565
Emily.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.565
You need
to go now.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.165
Because if you
sanctioned an exorcism

17:47.200 --> 17:49.700
And he died, i can press to
make you an accessory to murder.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.400
Emily, emily,
that is enough. Stop it.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.700
Let's go.

17:58.100 --> 18:01.000
I apologize
for the intrusion.

18:13.900 --> 18:14.900
What happened?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.600
I think there may be
a third victim.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.100
Is that
what you think?

18:20.500 --> 18:21.400
I don't know.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.500
Uh, we have
ligature marks,

18:23.600 --> 18:24.565
The spain connection,

18:24.600 --> 18:26.500
And scuff marks
under the bed.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.100
Hotch, it's weird,
definitely,

18:29.300 --> 18:30.165
But there's no way
to physically

18:30.200 --> 18:32.600
Connect dehydration, a heart
attack, and an aneurism.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.065
What's goin' on?

18:34.100 --> 18:35.500
Well, we've had
a complaint.

18:35.700 --> 18:36.665
J.J.'S trying
to smooth it over

18:36.700 --> 18:40.200
With the d.C. Police, but we
haven't been invited in on the case.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.100
Hey, that's how
you have my back?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.400
Prentiss, i'm trying
to protect you.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.300
I don't need protection.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.700
Hotch just said
he got a complaint,

18:50.735 --> 18:51.765
And he didn't
come down on you.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.500
You realize that? You
just dodged a bullet.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.800
We have to approach this just
like we do any other case.

18:56.835 --> 18:57.965
Meaning what?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.065
Grief can make us
wanna believe

18:59.100 --> 19:01.650
There's a reason for
things when there's not.

19:01.685 --> 19:04.200
That woman couldn't even
use patrick's name.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.500
She could only say,
"my fiancé,"

19:06.800 --> 19:10.900
Because she's convinced something
else died in that room that night.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.000
Thanks.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.200
Emily.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
As far as the police
are concerned,

19:26.035 --> 19:27.965
There is no open
murder investigation.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.200
We have no reason to be
investigating if they're not.

19:30.235 --> 19:31.500
Well, they're right.
All we have

19:31.535 --> 19:32.265
Are 3 men who died

19:32.300 --> 19:34.500
In 3 very different
natural deaths.

19:34.535 --> 19:35.800
So we just drop it?

19:37.500 --> 19:41.100
Dave, do you really believe we're dealing
with someone trying to exorcise demons?

19:41.135 --> 19:42.700
It doesn't matter
what i believe.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.200
Possession,
mental illness?

19:44.235 --> 19:46.065
Exorcist, unsub?

19:46.100 --> 19:47.000
Who cares
what's true?

19:47.035 --> 19:48.265
People are dying.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.600
This isn't
about religion.

19:49.635 --> 19:50.800
It's about evil.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.000
We attack it with
analysis and diligence.

19:53.035 --> 19:55.100
For this unsub, it's
a fight to the death.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.550
All hail the mistress
of information.

19:57.585 --> 19:59.300
- You got somethin'?
- You know i do.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.900
It's a posting from
a web bulletin board

20:01.935 --> 20:03.917
By matthew benton to
create a support group

20:03.952 --> 20:05.865
For people who felt
betrayed by their faith.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.300
Well, that helps explain
how these 3 men came together.

20:08.335 --> 20:10.065
It gets better.
The week the 3 of them

20:10.100 --> 20:13.200
Were in spain, the services
at santiago de compostela

20:13.235 --> 20:15.500
Were canceled when
the priest there died.

20:15.535 --> 20:16.617
Died how?

20:16.652 --> 20:17.665
Heart attack.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.400
But if you listen to
the conspiracy chatter,

20:19.435 --> 20:21.465
There is a strong belief
he was killed

20:21.500 --> 20:24.000
To interrupt services during
the height of the pilgrimage.

20:24.035 --> 20:24.900
How?

20:25.000 --> 20:26.665
Well, their best guess
is some kind of gas,

20:26.700 --> 20:29.200
Sarin or vx, something that
wouldn't show up in an autopsy.

20:29.235 --> 20:30.817
But it could be
anything that would

20:30.852 --> 20:32.400
Induce stress,
cause a heart attack.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.100
Then we have
a motive.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.150
And a potential m.O.,
an eye for an eye.

20:36.185 --> 20:38.492
Without an invitation
from the police,

20:38.527 --> 20:40.800
I cannot authorize
an investigation.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.500
This has to be
kept quiet.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.500
So the police are
not investigating?

20:52.800 --> 20:54.600
Exorcism is
a tough theory to sell.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.900
The police don't think
the deaths are connected.

20:56.935 --> 20:57.800
But you do.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.500
You're gonna have to
give me some time here.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.900
Uh, david rossi,
this is john cooley.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.600
He was also a friend
of matthew's.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.765
I'm sorry. You saw him recently?

21:07.800 --> 21:11.300
- Yeah.
- Is there anyone he associated with out of the usual?

21:11.335 --> 21:12.917
Anyone overtly
religious?

21:12.952 --> 21:14.500
Not that i'm aware of.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.950
I've been doin' my best
to retrace his steps,

21:16.985 --> 21:18.900
But i still haven't
come up with anything.

21:19.900 --> 21:21.200
Buy you a cup
of coffee?

21:23.700 --> 21:24.800
Yeah.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.000
I- I will call you
if i hear anything.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.000
Yeah.

21:39.100 --> 21:42.600
There are, uh, nicer places
to take a girl for coffee.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.600
<i>Did you ever see
the exorcist?</i>

21:45.000 --> 21:45.765
Yeah.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.900
The real case
started right here.

21:48.400 --> 21:53.000
The fire department actually
burned down the house themselves.

21:53.035 --> 21:56.400
The authorities referred
to the boy as robbie doe.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.700
He's still
in the d.C. Area today.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.265
Why did you
bring me here?

22:00.300 --> 22:03.900
Whole lot of effort went into
destroying the house of a kid

22:03.935 --> 22:07.500
Who probably had onset
schizophrenia or tourette's syndrome.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.100
I'm not
following you.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.900
You're sure
he was murdered.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.900
So what's the story?

22:18.100 --> 22:20.200
If you, uh,
don't wanna explain,

22:20.300 --> 22:21.600
That's fine,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.600
But if you do,
i'm all in.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.000
Matthew knew the bible
inside and out,

22:31.300 --> 22:33.500
And he started
to question everything.

22:33.700 --> 22:34.600
Why?

22:43.800 --> 22:45.600
We moved around a lot
when i was a kid,

22:46.100 --> 22:47.900
'Cause of
my mom's postings.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.500
It was hard
to get accepted,

22:52.400 --> 22:55.900
And when you're 15,
that's all you want.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.600
You'll do
almost anything.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.400
You got pregnant.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.300
Yeah.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.400
Was matthew the father?

23:08.435 --> 23:09.300
No.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.600
I didn't know what to do.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.800
I couldn't tell my mom.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.200
Matthew suggested
i talk with our priest.

23:20.235 --> 23:21.365
And what did he say?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.900
He said that
if i had an abortion,

23:23.935 --> 23:26.400
I wasn't welcome
in his congregation.

23:26.435 --> 23:27.665
So what'd you do?

23:27.700 --> 23:29.200
Matthew found a doctor.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.700
He took me there.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.900
He stayed with me.

23:36.100 --> 23:38.300
That sunday when we
got back to rome,

23:38.800 --> 23:42.900
He held my hand and
walked me into the church.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.400
Father gamino actually
stopped his sermon,

23:48.700 --> 23:50.500
But matthew told me
to hold my head up,

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
And we walked
to the front pew.

23:52.635 --> 23:53.965
What did the priest do?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.200
He and matthew
just stared at each other.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.700
It was like
a battle of wills, and-

23:59.400 --> 24:02.400
And then suddenly father
gamino went back to his sermon.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
Matthew saved my life.

24:09.600 --> 24:13.500
He made me feel like
i was worthy of...

24:13.800 --> 24:17.000
Love and friendship.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.400
But that's when his anger
and questioning started.

24:21.435 --> 24:22.400
Yeah.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.400
He started doing drugs.

24:25.700 --> 24:30.500
And when that melded with
his religious questioning,

24:30.535 --> 24:32.665
You could understand
why his parents

24:32.700 --> 24:35.300
Were afraid he was
possessed by something evil.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.865
It's my fault...

24:37.900 --> 24:40.200
That matthew's life
unraveled.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.300
Garcia uncovered
some information.

24:43.500 --> 24:48.000
It's possible matthew and the
others killed someone in spain.

24:48.035 --> 24:50.965
No.
I don't believe that.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.465
I'm just saying
if we keep pushing,

24:53.500 --> 24:56.800
You have to be prepared
for what we might discover.

24:57.900 --> 25:00.100
I need matthew
to rest in peace.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.965
I owe him that.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Then let's
go give a profile.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.200
The-The police
haven't invited us in.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.100
The police aren't gonna do us
any good on this one, anyway.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.600
As i was saying
to the agents,

25:13.635 --> 25:14.865
This is a topic
on which

25:14.900 --> 25:18.200
We usually agree to
silently disagree.

25:18.235 --> 25:20.165
And we all respect that.

25:20.200 --> 25:24.500
We are not here to examine your
beliefs in demonology or exorcism,

25:24.535 --> 25:26.365
But we are operating
on the theory

25:26.400 --> 25:29.800
That the person responsible
for these deaths does believe.

25:29.835 --> 25:32.565
We believe the inciting
incident was the death

25:32.600 --> 25:36.700
Of father raul del toro in
galicia, spain, 4 months ago.

25:36.735 --> 25:37.700
How so, david?

25:37.900 --> 25:39.500
Th-There's an element
who believes

25:39.535 --> 25:41.065
That the death
was actually a murder.

25:41.100 --> 25:45.200
You-You're not suggesting that
this is some kind of retribution?

25:45.235 --> 25:47.800
Even a priest can have
a psychotic break.

25:48.100 --> 25:51.200
He may be under the delusion
that he is working for god.

25:51.235 --> 25:52.265
The man we're
looking for would

25:52.300 --> 25:54.665
Be obsessed with the event in galicia.

25:54.700 --> 25:57.200
He believes he's fighting
evil and may very well

25:57.235 --> 25:59.267
Have followed these men
here to washington.

25:59.302 --> 26:01.300
Uh, we believe that
one of the exorcisms

26:01.335 --> 26:03.065
Took place
over enough days

26:03.100 --> 26:05.500
For the victim to
die of dehydration.

26:05.535 --> 26:06.665
Uh, if i may,

26:06.700 --> 26:08.600
An exorcism
is like a prize fight.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.865
It's completely
draining,

26:09.900 --> 26:11.465
Both physically
and spiritually.

26:11.500 --> 26:15.565
Now, if this man truly
performed 3 rituals

26:15.600 --> 26:19.300
Within the last few weeks,
he would need medical care.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.465
Is there somewhere
he would go to convalesce?

26:21.500 --> 26:25.800
Um, anything less than a working
hospital would be too dangerous.

26:33.800 --> 26:34.850
Garcia, it's reid.

26:34.885 --> 26:35.865
Speak, boy wonder.

26:35.900 --> 26:37.900
I need you to run
catholic hospital records.

26:37.935 --> 26:39.465
Look for any admissions
for exhaustion

26:39.500 --> 26:41.600
Immediately following
patrick cavanaugh's death.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.100
You got it?

26:44.300 --> 26:45.365
You know i do.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.465
All right, now run
the same search

26:46.500 --> 26:48.700
For the days immediately
following the first 2 deaths.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.700
Oh, i sense a cross-Check in my future.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.900
Do you have anything?

26:54.600 --> 26:56.465
One hit-
Father paul silvano.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.900
Currently at st.
Agatha's hospital on 214.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
We got him.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.500
Are you
father paul silvano?

27:07.100 --> 27:08.000
Yes.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.600
Were you present at the
deaths of thomas valentine,

27:11.635 --> 27:13.800
Matthew benton,
and patrick cavanaugh?

27:13.900 --> 27:15.500
I've been
expecting you.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.100
He asked you
a question.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.365
Yes, i was present.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.500
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say-

27:24.535 --> 27:27.300
Look in the nightstand drawer.

27:29.500 --> 27:30.600
What did he say?

27:32.300 --> 27:34.600
He wants you
to look in the drawer.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.900
We're both fighting
the same evil.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.300
What is it?

27:42.200 --> 27:43.900
It's diplomatic status.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.600
He has immunity?

27:58.000 --> 28:02.800
Explain to me why you were the last
person in the room when 3 men died.

28:02.835 --> 28:04.200
I'm a priest.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.000
I was there for them
spiritually.

28:06.035 --> 28:07.700
They weren't
on their deathbeds.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.100
Not physically.

28:09.135 --> 28:10.100
Did you kill them?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.000
No.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.900
But you're not sorry
any of them are dead.

28:13.935 --> 28:16.200
Physical death
is always sad,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.100
But now their souls
are in heaven.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.000
For that, their families have peace.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.250
Up until 4 months ago,
his record's spotless-

28:28.285 --> 28:30.900
No history of mental illness,
no censures.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.400
He was even invited to say mass at
the washington national cathedral.

28:34.435 --> 28:36.165
What happened
4 months ago?

28:36.200 --> 28:39.200
No details. Just says he took a
sabbatical for personal reasons.

28:39.235 --> 28:42.600
4 months ago is just
after the death in spain.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.965
It looks like
he lobbied the vatican

28:45.000 --> 28:47.900
For a diplomatic posting,
but they refused.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
After that, he, uh, took the world hunger
mission from the italian government.

28:52.035 --> 28:54.200
Which brought him here
with immunity.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.200
Where's hotch?

28:55.300 --> 28:56.800
He's on the phone
with the state department.

28:56.835 --> 28:58.065
Gather the others.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.400
I'll be there
in a second.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.200
Did you know...

29:04.700 --> 29:06.900
The priest
who died in galicia?

29:07.200 --> 29:09.750
Father del toro and i
were at seminary together.

29:09.785 --> 29:12.300
Did you know that matthew
benton and the other men

29:12.335 --> 29:14.500
Were in galicia
the week he died?

29:14.800 --> 29:15.565
Yes.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.850
Do you believe
they committed murder?

29:17.885 --> 29:20.100
I was contacted
by a family member.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.500
He was frightened.

29:21.600 --> 29:25.200
He told me his real son never
returned home from that trip.

29:25.235 --> 29:27.865
And you suggested
that he was possessed.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.700
I said that i could help
rid his child of evil.

29:30.735 --> 29:33.065
What did you tell
the other family members

29:33.100 --> 29:36.150
After you watched their sons
die, that it was god's will?

29:36.185 --> 29:39.200
I've never laid a hand on
anyone with malice in my life.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.400
Then explain
these deaths to me.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.700
You know
the power of evil.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.700
You've been fighting it
a long time.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.600
Do you still pray?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.200
This isn't about me.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.700
Be strong.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.100
The storm's
almost over.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.500
Yes, sir.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.100
I completely understand.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.800
As far as i know,
he's here vol-Voluntarily.

30:15.000 --> 30:15.800
Right.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.800
I understand it's
a delicate situation.

30:24.000 --> 30:24.765
What'd he say?

30:24.800 --> 30:27.165
He claims he was invited
by the families.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.900
And now he has them believing their
loved ones are in a better place.

30:29.935 --> 30:31.200
And they're all devout.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.650
The people they loved
were troubled.

30:32.685 --> 30:33.765
With his stature,
it's either believe

30:33.800 --> 30:35.600
They're in a better place
or live with the guilt.

30:35.635 --> 30:37.400
It doesn't matter, anyway.
We can't arrest him.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.500
- Can we deport him?
- Probably not.

30:39.535 --> 30:41.265
It's crazy.
Diplomatic immunity

30:41.300 --> 30:43.700
Wasn't intended to shield
people from murder charges.

30:43.735 --> 30:45.167
So hotch bypasses the state department,

30:45.202 --> 30:46.600
Goes straight to the italian consulate.

30:46.635 --> 30:47.900
And loses his career.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.200
The state department won't risk
the potential embarrassment.

30:51.235 --> 30:52.365
They'll shut us all down.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.700
Well, there's some
realpolitik for you.

30:53.735 --> 30:55.000
So what
do we do now?

30:55.100 --> 30:56.965
Did you check
his papers with ice?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.400
Yeah. His diplomatic status
runs till the end of the month.

31:00.200 --> 31:00.965
Huh.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.700
- What?
- Well, he told emily,

31:02.735 --> 31:04.400
"The storm's
almost over."

31:04.600 --> 31:07.100
- So...
- So forget priest.

31:07.135 --> 31:08.300
Think unsub.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.100
He's a believer.
He deals in certainties.

31:11.135 --> 31:13.865
In his mind,
he has a job to do.

31:13.900 --> 31:15.800
Which doesn't end until
the end of the month.

31:15.835 --> 31:18.900
<i>The storm's almost over.</i>

31:19.800 --> 31:21.500
There's another victim
on his list.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.800
What caused
their deaths?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.050
Medically?

31:25.085 --> 31:26.100
Yes. Please.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.600
I can't say.

31:27.700 --> 31:28.900
Were they under stress?

31:30.700 --> 31:31.565
We all were.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.200
Did you sprinkle
holy water on them?

31:33.235 --> 31:34.800
That's part of
the exorcism ritual.

31:34.835 --> 31:36.200
What was
in the holy water?

31:36.600 --> 31:38.765
Sarin? Vx?

31:38.800 --> 31:41.800
The smallest amount would
trigger respiratory failure.

31:41.835 --> 31:43.717
- I'm not familiar with them.
- No? Really?

31:43.752 --> 31:45.600
Because that's what
a lot of people think

31:45.635 --> 31:48.200
Killed father del toro
in spain.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.300
Father,
you're free to go.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.900
We're sorry if detaining you
has caused you any hardship.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.700
I hope you find peace.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.500
My office.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.050
Are you actually accusing
the italian government

32:12.085 --> 32:14.500
Of authorizing this man's
assassination list?

32:14.535 --> 32:17.300
He admits he was present
at every death.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.500
The case is over.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.300
You said you'd
give me leeway.

32:22.335 --> 32:23.465
And i did.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.100
I understand
your frustration.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.100
There are some things
that we cannot control.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.400
Take some time off.

32:29.800 --> 32:30.800
What?

32:31.000 --> 32:34.300
I don't wanna see you in the
office for the next few days.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.200
You up for
another drive?

33:02.800 --> 33:03.965
What are you doing here?

33:04.000 --> 33:07.600
We know matthew died during an
exorcism by father paul silvano.

33:07.635 --> 33:10.100
He's performed 3
in the last few weeks.

33:10.135 --> 33:11.365
Each subject has died.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.000
We believe he's
planning another one.

33:13.035 --> 33:14.265
That's none
of our business.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.400
Matthew's gone.
You've accepted that.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.265
At least let us warn
the last family

33:18.300 --> 33:20.800
So they know what kind
of choice they're facing.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.000
This isn't about me.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.100
This is about
other families

33:26.400 --> 33:28.200
And the people
they love.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
Father paul
didn't kill matthew.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.100
Why are you so willing
to accept that?

33:41.600 --> 33:43.100
I- I'm just trying
to find the truth

33:43.200 --> 33:44.600
About how
your son died.

33:44.635 --> 33:45.900
Then listen to me.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.900
Father paul never
laid a hand on matthew.

33:48.935 --> 33:50.200
How do you know that?

33:52.200 --> 33:53.300
Dad!

33:54.400 --> 33:56.300
...and all your
dark companions!

33:57.400 --> 33:58.600
Don't look him
in the eye!

33:58.635 --> 34:00.200
Don't engage him!

34:00.300 --> 34:02.200
- Dad, please.
- I cast you out...

34:02.235 --> 34:04.765
Dad, please! Raah!

34:04.800 --> 34:06.700
Don't look him
in the eyes!

34:07.900 --> 34:09.000
I was there.

34:11.900 --> 34:15.800
You stood there and
watched matthew die?

34:17.100 --> 34:19.000
He wasn't
the person you knew.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.699
Because father paul
said that?

34:24.400 --> 34:27.000
Something horrible happened
on that trip to spain.

34:27.034 --> 34:29.600
You believe that because
father paul said it.

34:29.635 --> 34:30.965
You can't think
for yourself?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.300
Young lady, do not
speak to me like that.

34:33.335 --> 34:34.364
How could you
allow him

34:34.400 --> 34:37.000
To perform a ritual
over matthew?

34:37.034 --> 34:37.965
I loved my son.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.949
Then you knew
how matthew was.

34:39.985 --> 34:41.992
You knew how paranoid he could be.

34:42.027 --> 34:43.965
I was trying
to save his life.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.500
That priest must
have done something.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.500
Matthew's heart wouldn't
have just given out.

34:48.534 --> 34:50.199
That thing killed matthew!

34:50.800 --> 34:52.500
It was inside him for years.

34:52.534 --> 34:54.817
I know you know that's true.

34:54.851 --> 34:57.100
No. Matthew was
a sweet boy.

34:57.135 --> 34:58.800
He was
just troubled.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.900
He was never troubled
until he met you.

35:05.900 --> 35:11.500
Look, we need to know about the
demon that possessed your son.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.400
Father paul explained
that matthew was a conduit.

35:15.435 --> 35:16.765
If you opened
yourself up to him,

35:16.800 --> 35:19.800
You were putting yourself
in danger of being taken over.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.700
Who else was matthew with
while he was in spain?

35:23.000 --> 35:23.765
I don't know.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.700
Well, who did he see once
he was back in washington?

35:26.735 --> 35:28.465
- No one.
- Please think.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.300
If father paul believes
matthew was a conduit,

35:31.400 --> 35:34.500
Anyone he spent time
with could be a target.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.300
He was not to see anyone
until he was better.

35:37.335 --> 35:38.765
No, that's not true.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.500
I - I know for a fact
he saw our friend john cooley.

35:41.535 --> 35:42.900
His parents worked
with my mother

35:42.935 --> 35:43.865
At the embassy
in rome.

35:43.900 --> 35:46.500
You called him to tell
him matthew had died.

35:47.900 --> 35:52.200
I haven't spoken with john
cooley in over 20 years,

35:52.235 --> 35:54.300
Not since you were
kids in italy.

36:07.700 --> 36:09.100
They're going
to stop you.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.000
They have no authority.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.865
My orders come from god.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.300
I'm not part
of your congregation.

36:14.335 --> 36:15.800
You have no right
to be here.

36:15.835 --> 36:17.300
You don't frighten me...

36:17.335 --> 36:18.800
Belial.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.600
I'm stronger than you.

36:25.500 --> 36:26.800
We'll see about that.

36:26.835 --> 36:28.000
Heh.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.600
Murderer!

36:52.700 --> 36:54.400
- We need to talk.
- What's wrong?

36:54.435 --> 36:56.100
He's performing
another exorcism.

36:56.135 --> 36:57.000
How do you know?

36:57.300 --> 36:59.600
Prentiss and i went to see
matthew benton's parents.

36:59.635 --> 37:00.865
I gave her
a direct order.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.000
- This one is all on me.
- Well, that's fine, dave,

37:03.035 --> 37:04.600
By the state department's
all over my ass.

37:04.635 --> 37:05.465
Where's prentiss now?

37:05.500 --> 37:07.100
She and morgan
went to stop it.

37:07.135 --> 37:08.367
I can't protect them.

37:08.402 --> 37:09.565
I don't accept that.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.600
Dave, governments don't
really appreciate

37:11.635 --> 37:13.367
Being accused
of accessory to murder.

37:13.402 --> 37:15.065
Why not go straight
to the vatican?

37:15.100 --> 37:16.800
And what are we
supposed to say to them?

37:16.835 --> 37:18.465
Say, "talk to
the italian government.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.400
Help us stop this man
from perverting your beliefs."

37:26.600 --> 37:28.200
This comes down
on all of us.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.400
I'm fine with that? You?

37:35.900 --> 37:38.700
You're a murderer!

37:46.200 --> 37:48.200
- John!
- I abjure you!

37:48.235 --> 37:49.600
Aah!

37:52.400 --> 37:54.150
I will cast you out
like the-

37:54.185 --> 37:55.865
You're a murderer!
Murderer!

37:55.900 --> 37:57.900
I abjure you in the name
of the spotless-

37:57.935 --> 37:59.400
- Step away from him!
- Fbi.

37:59.435 --> 38:00.817
Tremble and flee...

38:00.852 --> 38:02.165
Step away from him!

38:02.200 --> 38:03.500
As we call on
the name of the lord.

38:03.535 --> 38:04.065
Step away.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.400
- You have no right to be here!
- Get away.

38:05.435 --> 38:06.465
This is
my friend's house.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.750
- This is not your friend!
- Murderer!

38:08.785 --> 38:11.000
- No, don't touch him!
- Step away.

38:11.035 --> 38:11.765
Stop!

38:11.800 --> 38:13.350
What is in
that bottle?!

38:13.385 --> 38:14.865
Stop!
Accursed one...

38:14.900 --> 38:16.900
- Out!
- Give honor to god, the father almighty.

38:16.935 --> 38:18.700
Don't protect him.
They didn't protect you

38:18.735 --> 38:20.200
When you were
a little boy.

38:20.300 --> 38:21.365
Shh, shh, shh.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.500
Give praise to the lord
jesus christ.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.067
John, shh.
I wanna untie you,

38:25.102 --> 38:26.600
But i need you
to calm down.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.200
Look at me.
It's emily.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.800
- John.
- Emily.

38:29.900 --> 38:30.800
All right,
i'm gonna untie you.

38:30.835 --> 38:32.700
Just stay calm, ok?

38:35.100 --> 38:36.565
Ok. Ok.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.350
Ok, ok. Shh.

38:38.385 --> 38:40.100
Ok. Shh. John.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.000
- Just right-
- Ah, emily, come on.

38:45.035 --> 38:45.565
I'm fine.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.700
No. Look at you.

38:47.100 --> 38:48.500
Stress can tear
your body apart.

38:48.535 --> 38:49.900
That's what happened
to matthew.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.700
Emily, i'm sorry
i wasn't there for you.

38:56.900 --> 38:57.900
In italy.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.300
Ok, just let them
do their job.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.300
Good-Bye.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.300
I'll check
on you later.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.700
If you want my gun
and badge, i understand.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.565
There's a plane ticket
in your name to rome.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.000
Agent morgan and i will
drive you to the airport.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.500
Any of your belongings
can be shipped to you.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.600
You have no right
to deport me.

39:28.635 --> 39:30.065
The vatican intervened.

39:30.100 --> 39:33.400
The italian government has
rescinded your diplomatic status.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.450
They'll do with you
as they see fit

39:35.485 --> 39:37.200
When you're back in
their jurisdiction.

39:38.100 --> 39:41.200
You've all just made the world
a much more dangerous place.

39:42.700 --> 39:45.700
May god's love be with you.

39:45.735 --> 39:47.900
And with you.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.100
I saw that guy up there.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.500
He was certain he was fighting
against some kind of evil.

39:54.535 --> 39:55.965
We all have to
be certain.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.100
Rossi, don't tell me
you believe in evil.

39:58.135 --> 40:00.200
Don't tell me you do
this job and you don't.

40:00.235 --> 40:02.100
I believe there
are evil acts,

40:02.600 --> 40:04.000
But those are choices,

40:04.600 --> 40:05.900
Brain chemistry.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.000
What do you think,
hotch?

40:09.500 --> 40:13.100
I think deep down, we're all
capable of unspeakable things.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.600
Where it starts
or what you call it,

40:16.300 --> 40:17.200
I don't know.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.100
Let's get him
out of here.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.500
Thank you.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.300
Always.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.700
What are you
thinking?

40:34.300 --> 40:36.600
<i>It's like the end
of the dead...</i>

40:38.300 --> 40:42.100
When gretta remembers the boy
she loved when she was younger

40:43.300 --> 40:44.700
And she says...

40:45.600 --> 40:47.800
"I think he died for me."

40:50.900 --> 40:55.600
You know, james joyce also said,
"there is no heresy or philosophy

40:55.635 --> 41:00.100
So abhorrent to the church
as a human being."

41:03.200 --> 41:04.700
Where can i drop you?

41:05.400 --> 41:07.300
I'm gonna walk
for a while.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.600
Almost seems unreal,
doesn't it?

41:20.700 --> 41:23.000
This area
clear, please.
