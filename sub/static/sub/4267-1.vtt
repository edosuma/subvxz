02:51.223 --> 02:54.768
- Hands in the head. - You do not need a gun.

02:54.851 --> 02:59.314
- Show me where my son. - Take a walk with me first.

02:59.398 --> 03:02.151
If you ask me, I will kill you.

03:04.778 --> 03:07.615
Do you kill someone feel better?

03:07.698 --> 03:12.245
Revenge ... it does not work like that.

03:12.495 --> 03:17.792
- Vengeance is all I have. - Hold on a bit in this case.

03:29.930 --> 03:36.019
One more thing. I have to tell my story to you on the road.

03:42.902 --> 03:45.654
You kill me, you will never know what is.

04:03.381 --> 04:05.675
Story began in the water.

04:10.180 --> 04:14.559
I do not know what you know about surfing, but I'll tell you what I know.

04:24.570 --> 04:28.199
The poor become rich every day in the Pacific.

04:32.954 --> 04:38.001
I learned next to where I live in Sunset Beach, California.

04:57.146 --> 05:01.483
Look at those idiots. They dip their Mexican uniforms.

05:02.359 --> 05:06.781
- Dad, they went bankrupt. - What does it cost to buy the rods?

05:06.864 --> 05:11.410
- Clearly a lot. - They can do nothing about the hidden.

05:12.537 --> 05:15.790
- They believe that the Pacific is the lake. - No, they do not respect.

05:15.873 --> 05:18.876
Surprisingly that they take off shoes and socks.

05:30.889 --> 05:34.601
- Want to Mexico? - Shit Mexico.

05:36.645 --> 05:41.400
- Remember that ended with him. - Yes, but she knew that she was mine.

06:10.013 --> 06:15.060
- Hell! - Dad!

06:15.143 --> 06:19.773
- It is a family beach, stupid! - It? It used to be Mexico.

06:19.898 --> 06:22.359
Not anymore.

06:34.330 --> 06:37.417
We fight. Give me support.

06:45.550 --> 06:48.011
Damn!

06:51.598 --> 06:54.309
Come on!

06:55.227 --> 06:58.188
Enter here!

07:02.234 --> 07:06.614
If I die, I would have hit my brother.

07:10.952 --> 07:14.497
- To, Ben. - To, Jeanette.

07:14.580 --> 07:18.126
- I love you. - And I love you.

07:19.669 --> 07:23.131
- She was 16. - This is better than 14.

07:23.214 --> 07:26.176
Kevy! Hello ...

07:29.346 --> 07:33.350
- How are you? - Can you breathe?

07:34.434 --> 07:39.648
Go to hell. Tell the mother that she gets when I'm ready, okay?

07:39.732 --> 07:44.403
- Certain. Going out? - My neck has been broken! You're there.

07:44.653 --> 07:49.992
- This is not funny. - Sorry.

07:50.076 --> 07:53.663
Look, I have trained a new trick and you get the picture.

07:53.746 --> 07:58.543
You might have 10 minutes before emerging surf photographers.

07:58.626 --> 08:03.089
You can contact Sam Mann Surfer Magazine. He likes the picture ...

08:03.173 --> 08:06.217
- I do not know, but maybe ... - good songs.

08:09.054 --> 08:12.516
Make no see you before me there.

08:14.434 --> 08:18.105
I'm not asking for anything special. I just want a livable wage.

08:18.188 --> 08:23.444
Why do we employ them? They will not succeed.

08:23.527 --> 08:29.033
It is okay. better we employ people at the regular price.

08:29.116 --> 08:32.410
Until then I have to protect the company - you know it.

08:33.871 --> 08:35.914
Jim.

08:39.085 --> 08:42.255
- I lost my home .... - I could lose my good.

08:42.337 --> 08:46.509
- Which of them? You've got five. - It's late, Trick.

08:46.593 --> 08:51.473
Enjoy your spare time. In addition, a good wave in the street. I love you.

08:53.725 --> 08:57.187
Fuck him. It is still the beach for.

08:57.271 --> 09:00.274
You will help Kevy to pay the bills?

09:02.651 --> 09:05.154
Come on.

09:10.534 --> 09:13.538
- What are you doing here? - How are you, Trick?

09:13.621 --> 09:16.582
- Are you not in the north where the money is? - Where's Ben?

09:16.666 --> 09:19.168
- Upstairs at Jalama. - Jalama?

09:19.252 --> 09:22.839
- Although I have to work. - Thank you.

09:26.176 --> 09:30.722
- How are you? Let us high. - Yes.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.184
Kevy, hastily. There he is.

09:37.729 --> 09:43.569
- Should I do it for you? - I know what I'm doing. Silence.

09:43.652 --> 09:52.245
- Look. I got it the other day. - Good. Right either.

09:52.328 --> 09:55.206
- There he is. - No.

09:56.582 --> 10:00.336
- What? - Wait a wave.

10:01.421 --> 10:05.675
So he came there, doing and turned around.

10:05.759 --> 10:08.678
- Kevy. - Photo, aku mengerti.

10:11.765 --> 10:15.268
- Good. - You can swear.

10:17.437 --> 10:21.400
- Dirt, which Ben! - Hell, you missed him.

10:22.693 --> 10:25.905
- Trick, asshole. - Too late, motherfuckers.

10:28.491 --> 10:32.870
- There it is. - Evy, the beach takes care of itself.

10:32.954 --> 10:34.372
- Want one? - No.

10:34.622 --> 10:37.166
Buy a bottle of bubbles, but radiology extended.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.502
We share here. It is pure gold.

10:39.585 --> 10:42.172
- So valuable, Kevy. - No, you can take it anywhere.

10:42.255 --> 10:46.343
- Attitude stillborn. - The waves come tomorrow too.

10:46.426 --> 10:50.263
- Meanwhile ... - Where?

10:52.682 --> 10:55.227
- Martys house will be demolished. - You do not have to go there, Trick.

10:55.477 --> 10:59.356
- I'm not going to miss the party. - Stay away from trouble.

11:00.357 --> 11:04.904
- We go! We go! - Cecil! Do not forget your skateboard.

11:04.987 --> 11:09.450
- This is not mine. - Ok, I sell them online.

11:23.756 --> 11:29.137
- Here. - Think about the installment of the mine detector?

11:29.221 --> 11:33.475
Then they said, "Surely you can afford it." I have no problem with it, -

11:33.558 --> 11:38.897
- But once the house is now worth 850,000 dollars and possibly 4000.

11:38.981 --> 11:42.526
Fire! They made me, I guess.

11:42.609 --> 11:47.948
But you know what? Do they have a home so they can get it!

11:48.032 --> 11:48.991
Exactly!

11:51.243 --> 11:56.290
I love this place. John, wait! I'll take care of it.

11:57.542 --> 12:01.296
It took three weeks to set up the dirt.

12:02.714 --> 12:04.591
Look at this.

12:09.512 --> 12:11.348
That is all!

12:17.062 --> 12:20.274
- I board here destroyed. - Dirt.

12:22.151 --> 12:25.654
- Only exist? - Yes, how many do you think?

12:28.032 --> 12:33.871
$ -40. -40? I have 40 bags here.

12:35.248 --> 12:40.003
Always. It smells good.

12:40.086 --> 12:45.717
- When can I pick it up? - I have a lot to do now.

12:45.800 --> 12:51.765
- It might help. - You know what? Your first line.

12:53.016 --> 12:54.601
We'll see.

13:34.559 --> 13:38.730
- When was the same story again. - Mom wants everyone to see it.

13:38.814 --> 13:41.608
No, that's just me.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.866
Hi, honey. No surfing?

13:57.667 --> 14:01.170
Wow.

14:01.921 --> 14:06.009
Is Gerry? Some earn money somehow.

14:09.638 --> 14:13.809
- This is all I have. - Come on, you got it in two competitions.

14:13.892 --> 14:18.272
- Sometimes I want to surf without the crowds. - I understand.

14:18.355 --> 14:24.486
- You want to surf, make money ... - No, I want to surf when I want ...

14:24.570 --> 14:28.657
-... With no one watching. - But if no one is watching, it has not happened.

14:30.534 --> 14:35.581
- Go to hell. - Come on, just two thousand.

14:35.665 --> 14:38.334
That's all I have.

14:40.003 --> 14:44.883
- He will go to the Maldives. - Nothing is heard about him there.

14:47.010 --> 14:50.096
I had to smoke this up, it's good.

14:52.557 --> 14:56.603
Damn! I never get out of this cage.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.565
You will be out on tour again. That is what you are good at.

14:59.648 --> 15:04.778
There, please do. I do not see you go around the world.

15:04.862 --> 15:08.616
I do not like you. I do not surf all the waves, only my own.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.287
You are not ready for when you arrive.

15:13.371 --> 15:17.667
I'll go with you if that is what is needed.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.629
- And do what? - I do not know. Everything you hate.

15:21.713 --> 15:25.049
Pisse sponsoring down your spine pain ,, clean, real against the judge.

15:25.133 --> 15:30.305
And when we go bankrupt? It is rigged. It is industrial and not waves.

15:30.430 --> 15:35.686
Ben, we're all broke. We should go from here.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.608
- Is that Donna? - Looks like.

15:41.692 --> 15:46.530
- Who is he doing? - You let him go, remember?

15:46.614 --> 15:48.866
- Ben ... - Protect me.

15:48.949 --> 15:52.954
Ben! To hell! Ben!

15:53.037 --> 15:58.584
- You just left me there with him. - Donna, what the heck!

15:58.668 --> 16:04.591
God, Ben. I do not anymore. John, finally.

16:04.674 --> 16:08.345
- Relax. - Did he tell you wet?

16:08.428 --> 16:11.890
Go to hell! John, he'll kill you.

16:11.973 --> 16:14.726
Relax. Come on.

16:16.228 --> 16:18.939
Tuhan, Ben...

16:19.022 --> 16:22.693
You're dead, John. He has friends. Leave me!

16:27.615 --> 16:30.951
Shit. My God, it went well?

16:31.035 --> 16:35.873
- Do not touch me. - I can get you wet. Come here.

16:35.957 --> 16:41.004
- Are you wet now? I love you! - Stop lying.

16:41.087 --> 16:45.925
- Lying me? - Ben, set me up. What are you doing?

16:46.009 --> 16:50.305
- I love you. - Yes, on Friday, but not on Sundays.

16:50.388 --> 16:53.934
- No, I love you always. - You like the others.

16:55.769 --> 16:58.730
- I miss you. - Do not say like that.

16:58.814 --> 17:01.734
I got over you, let me not put me stuck here again.

17:01.817 --> 17:04.987
- Just drop me a bit. - No, I told the father that.

17:05.069 --> 17:10.201
What should he do? Fuck! When he returned from Iraq, we were married.

17:10.284 --> 17:12.744
- Married? - Yes, damn.

17:16.123 --> 17:18.501
- Say it. - I love you.

17:18.584 --> 17:21.921
- No, says you have to get married. - I will marry you.

17:22.005 --> 17:25.133
- Are you serious? - I swear, I love you.

17:29.888 --> 17:34.559
God ... Come here, baby.

17:42.901 --> 17:45.779
I love you so much.

17:45.863 --> 17:50.951
Are you okay? Whoa. Where did you learn to fight? In Malibu?

17:51.035 --> 17:56.457
- When someone beats you have to block. - The battle is always in its place?

17:56.541 --> 18:02.630
- They've been together since they were little. - Donna, is that ok?

18:02.714 --> 18:08.845
Quiet, he took her home. I do you. He was a disaster.

18:09.804 --> 18:13.892
- He was my boyfriend. - She was the girlfriend of everyone.

18:16.061 --> 18:20.065
That's what I mean. When you turn, you have to mean it.

18:20.149 --> 18:23.235
- Go to hell. - I'm just trying to help you, ok?

18:23.318 --> 18:26.196
Will you beach minutes, should be the rule.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.116
- This is not your beach. - Yes, that's it.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.662
Whether it is water, it is mine. Do inland, the pipe.

18:33.788 --> 18:37.917
Cause he saw it, he was already dead.

18:39.544 --> 18:42.755
Carrying weapons, for you can not fight.

18:47.177 --> 18:53.350
- Dad will love Donnas. - Yes, if he comes home from Iraq.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.687
If you are going to get along with the tour, had to leave all of this.

18:56.770 --> 19:02.943
Forget it. Everyone is in need of repair. "Johnnys mobile board repair."

19:04.111 --> 19:06.906
- You know the one in which Mexico? - Yes.

19:07.823 --> 19:12.411
- He belonged to a gang, El Rio Locos. - He does not fight like that.

19:12.495 --> 19:15.164
- But he wears the colors. - And?

19:15.248 --> 19:19.711
Did they kill you for a girl who had been taken?

19:19.794 --> 19:24.924
No ... I just borrowed it. She could have him.

19:36.186 --> 19:41.066
What do you do with it?

19:42.151 --> 19:44.153
Will you play a member of the gang now?

19:44.903 --> 19:48.991
- What? - I think you want to get out of here.

19:49.074 --> 19:54.372
Jo. But now I do not know where it is.

19:55.998 --> 19:58.042
It is not ok.

20:00.837 --> 20:05.341
Tell Donna that I have benefited to Wainini if â€‹â€‹he rings.

20:05.425 --> 20:08.261
What happened there?

20:51.598 --> 20:54.351
What?

21:04.486 --> 21:08.407
Benny Boy! It is time to stand up, ladies.

21:08.657 --> 21:14.205
- What is wrong with you? Come on! - Shit. This is the case, it's up to you.

21:16.332 --> 21:20.420
- What have you? - Dad!

21:20.503 --> 21:26.009
- This is a double gubbe there. - Please, tell me she was 18.

21:26.092 --> 21:28.136
Shit.

22:45.383 --> 22:49.387
We need to revive that way, see.

22:49.471 --> 22:52.307
We need to revive it.

22:57.396 --> 23:02.276
Is not he a little old to be playing with a hoop?

23:03.485 --> 23:07.072
- Think about her father seeing him now. - Say something.

23:07.156 --> 23:12.328
He will not listen to me. My mother, not the father.

23:12.411 --> 23:15.206
You little bastard.

23:17.375 --> 23:21.337
Hey Jeanette. Apa kabar?

23:21.421 --> 23:23.715
- Hey taxes. - Can I tell the mother what?

23:23.798 --> 23:28.386
- Tell me what? - Mamma. We're getting married.

23:29.679 --> 23:34.226
- Ben, you change ever. - Come on, he loves her.

23:34.309 --> 23:40.274
- Ben, you hang well with Jeanette? - What?

23:40.357 --> 23:45.321
- No, that's not true. - He married me. Really?

23:45.404 --> 23:50.409
Donna, sharpen. Ben, when did you do?

23:50.493 --> 23:57.750
- About four or five years. - You'll end up like a naughty girl.

23:57.834 --> 24:01.754
- What is needed in one to know one. - Three months and 14 days.

24:01.838 --> 24:04.883
- So we look at how you talk to me. - Dad comes home ...

24:04.966 --> 24:10.180
... But then he was back then. Why he will not be with you?

24:10.263 --> 24:13.225
Where you sleep tonight? For you do not sleep in my house.

24:13.308 --> 24:21.024
Hell! You're kidding? It's ok, I have everything spot.

24:21.108 --> 24:26.238
- Here, taste. - Hey, you in the parking lot?

24:27.156 --> 24:30.659
Okay, come and get me. I will call back. Yes, hurry up.

24:33.371 --> 24:35.498
Wait! Donna!

24:43.089 --> 24:47.260
- Woman! - Tunggu, Donna.

24:50.263 --> 24:53.642
- Donna, wait! - Go to hell!

24:53.892 --> 24:57.104
Donna, come here. What is wrong with you?

25:00.274 --> 25:02.442
Go to hell!

25:03.986 --> 25:07.072
- Fuck her. - Yes, give me a beer.

25:10.868 --> 25:17.500
Whether to fix a drink, so drink it himself.

25:17.583 --> 25:20.128
God, I'm sorry.

26:06.134 --> 26:08.428
Ben!

26:09.387 --> 26:13.433
Do you go to Magoo? Ronnie says that he can bring us to the bottom.

26:15.393 --> 26:17.396
It's better than this crap.

26:19.982 --> 26:22.151
Ben!

26:23.652 --> 26:26.697
Are you sleeping? Ben?

26:29.325 --> 26:31.327
Ben!

26:32.578 --> 26:36.415
Ben? Ben, bangun!

26:37.458 --> 26:39.836
Ben!

26:41.671 --> 26:45.425
Help! You there, call the emergency services!

27:04.528 --> 27:07.489
- Your Move. - Sorry.

27:10.784 --> 27:13.954
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight ...

27:14.038 --> 27:16.999
- You worked well, children. - To the left.

27:17.083 --> 27:20.920
- Eight, nine, ten ... - You have been known to be here during the quarter.

27:21.003 --> 27:24.257
- Are you getting bored? - No.

27:25.300 --> 27:29.429
- Can we try? - You certainly do not give up?

27:29.512 --> 27:33.183
- We will do everything we can. - Okay.

27:35.977 --> 27:38.814
Passed! One two three ...

27:44.570 --> 27:46.238
Once again.

27:50.826 --> 27:59.460
End. Well, you do well again? This is Ben. Kind, just once.

27:59.544 --> 28:08.595
Once again, please! Again ... Please ...

30:04.966 --> 30:09.929
John? John, menunggu.

30:12.140 --> 30:14.518
Take this.

30:54.267 --> 30:56.520
Rest in peace, brother.

31:17.667 --> 31:22.088
We are all dead now. Not only is Ben.

31:43.819 --> 31:48.657
- What is this? - This is the other side of the power plant.

32:00.795 --> 32:04.590
- Sorry to interrupt again. - Do detective again?

32:04.674 --> 32:08.928
- Where are you when you are needed? - Dad, let him do his job.

32:09.012 --> 32:12.474
- I have some questions. - Come

32:12.557 --> 32:15.685
I'll talk with John .. Join if you want.

32:15.769 --> 32:21.733
- It could swear, it was my home. - We have three murders ...

32:21.817 --> 32:25.863
... Only in El Rio. All had been killed with a shot in the head like Ben.

32:25.946 --> 32:28.699
Damn Mexican gangs.

32:32.161 --> 32:34.955
- Want something to drink? - No, thank you.

32:35.039 --> 32:38.042
- Should Ben relation to El Rio Locos? - No.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.711
- Is your lawn? - Not them.

32:40.795 --> 32:43.840
- My son smoke no grass. - Mom, she blows the grass.

32:43.923 --> 32:50.680
- Our son is in all the pictures, see. - And the green Honda Civic?

32:50.764 --> 32:55.101
- Do you remember the registration number? - No, I think not even on it.

32:55.185 --> 32:59.398
- Just talk to Donna. - He does not know his last name.

32:59.481 --> 33:02.651
He knew he was definitely not good. They met on the beach.

33:02.901 --> 33:05.487
- This is nonsense. - Calm down, we spoke with Donna.

33:05.571 --> 33:09.783
No, you do not. Not while the investigation is ongoing. Understand?

33:09.867 --> 33:17.583
- Ok, you have the names and the car. - You know how much the Civic here?

33:17.667 --> 33:22.296
What are you talking about? With the technology, satellite and dirt ...

33:22.380 --> 33:25.967
- You can not find the damn car ?! - Yes we can.

33:26.050 --> 33:30.638
But we have a plat or last name would help.

33:30.722 --> 33:34.643
How much work on this? Only you, huh?

33:34.726 --> 33:38.897
- I get help detectives. - And what have you done? Nothing?

33:38.980 --> 33:41.608
I was fired I did not do anything.

33:41.692 --> 33:47.156
John, call me if you think of something. We will solve this.

33:47.239 --> 33:52.077
- When? Next month? Next year? - As soon as we know anything, we'll call.

33:52.161 --> 33:54.622
I regret the loss.

33:56.165 --> 33:57.875
No chance that I wait one year!

34:26.697 --> 34:32.828
- Johnny! Johnny!
- Apa?

34:34.830 --> 34:38.960
You need to shine. Your father talked about killing children of Mexico.

34:39.043 --> 34:41.003
He spoke to everyone about it.

34:48.887 --> 34:52.724
- Are you okay? - Relax. Healey broke the drought.

34:54.851 --> 34:58.730
Are you kidding, Gloomy? Thursday, two years ago.

34:58.814 --> 35:01.900
- Do you not think I say that? - Dad does not drink, he drowned.

35:10.159 --> 35:14.038
He said he would go home and grab a gun and shot Miguel.

35:14.288 --> 35:16.916
Do you have a weapon?

35:18.876 --> 35:20.795
Dad?

35:22.630 --> 35:24.924
What are you doing with my gun?

35:26.134 --> 35:28.386
You know what we should do.

35:31.306 --> 35:33.600
- Mamma. - He was full. This ends now.

35:33.683 --> 35:37.938
It is ok, you're afraid. Do not worry, this is the case.

35:38.021 --> 35:41.942
- This is not right, Dad. - You know what? Wish I was there ...

35:43.485 --> 35:45.904
... I do not stand with hands in his pockets while my brother died.

35:45.988 --> 35:51.827
- I Asked always to Ben. - Ben needed no one did.

35:51.911 --> 35:56.499
- No, he was the golden boy. - What's wrong with you ?!

35:56.582 --> 36:00.920
He is dead, and you're still jealous.

36:01.003 --> 36:01.754
That is not true.

36:04.340 --> 36:06.759
Daddy, stop! Please stop!

36:08.928 --> 36:14.142
You never can take advantage of the problem page. Like when a big wave came.

36:14.225 --> 36:21.024
What are you doing? You give it. You have no backbone. You do not have the ball.

36:22.776 --> 36:26.989
- I have. - Do You?

36:28.782 --> 36:32.119
- I'm going to kill that bastard. - You just said a full bar there.

36:32.203 --> 36:36.791
- My friends do not know. - Grim could not close his mouth.

36:36.874 --> 36:41.045
- To hell with Bleak! - You can not solve anything.

36:41.129 --> 36:44.090
- It is not even drunk. - You ...

36:45.466 --> 36:49.888
You have to come with me because I was all you got. And You ...

36:49.971 --> 36:53.516
How often went to the store and see pictures brother

36:53.600 --> 36:57.145
- In any surfing magazine checkouts?

36:57.229 --> 37:04.945
I went there this morning and there she was. And I bought every magazine.

37:06.447 --> 37:09.241
Do you know why, John?

37:10.367 --> 37:13.162
For it will never happen again.

37:16.415 --> 37:19.961
You have a tomb to cry.

37:20.044 --> 37:22.130
Do you want one spit on, too?

37:25.675 --> 37:32.766
- John. - Good. If that is what you want, Dad.

37:34.309 --> 37:38.814
Okay, I'll do it. I do it if that's what you want.

37:42.609 --> 37:46.238
See? He must be a man.

37:46.321 --> 37:50.242
You later, Mom? Is that what you want?

37:56.499 --> 37:58.793
Eye for an eye.

38:06.676 --> 38:09.888
Why did you do that?

38:09.971 --> 38:14.184
You buried your brother, to the prize. You have to bury the bodies.

38:14.267 --> 38:21.566
I still believe that my son's life. Tell me what's behind all the sand.

38:23.151 --> 38:25.404
I can only show.

38:40.169 --> 38:42.338
Are you crying yet?

38:47.176 --> 38:49.220
Just as I browse.

38:52.640 --> 38:58.605
- Is this for my father? - Yes.

38:59.731 --> 39:02.442
He called us.

39:04.486 --> 39:09.158
- Does my father called? - Yes, he was talking with my dad for a while.

39:09.241 --> 39:13.287
He could not say where she was.

39:13.370 --> 39:17.750
- He did not call me. - Donna, it may not be time.

39:17.833 --> 39:20.378
Father sent an e-mail.

39:21.796 --> 39:26.175
"Sorry Dear." That's all she wrote.

39:31.014 --> 39:34.643
I think that he was sorry for that he could not come to the funeral.

39:42.943 --> 39:47.281
- How to Miguel there? - Do not know.

39:47.531 --> 39:51.327
Do not lie. I know that you did not tell the police everything.

39:51.410 --> 39:55.331
No, I do not. I say nothing.

39:56.332 --> 39:59.293
Miguel ring and say that you will meet.

40:01.295 --> 40:07.510
God ... So stupid of me.

40:08.970 --> 40:12.307
I think that at least you'll give me a hug or something?

40:12.557 --> 40:16.311
Donna, I will.

40:16.394 --> 40:20.273
- No - John, I've seen your eyes.

40:21.191 --> 40:25.821
You love me. You always love me. Ben has been told.

40:26.113 --> 40:29.533
He said you were going to ask me out before he did.

40:30.659 --> 40:33.579
- This is not true. - Want to see my body?

40:33.662 --> 40:39.126
Donna, stop! Your including Ben. You will always be his.

40:39.210 --> 40:47.218
- This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. - We are friends. Just friends.

40:48.511 --> 40:52.724
You know, you're not so tough. You'll fit you.

40:55.310 --> 41:03.151
John ... you're just afraid to be in love with me and get your heart broken.

41:04.903 --> 41:08.532
That's why you do not have no boyfriend. You scared.

41:08.615 --> 41:13.621
- You are not alone now, Donna. - I'm not ashamed of who I am.

41:17.249 --> 41:20.419
I can touch you.

41:22.672 --> 41:28.094
I could turn it off. But you certainly can not.

41:30.472 --> 41:33.266
That's why you never touch anyone.

41:35.226 --> 41:40.440
My way is better, so ... Call me if you want to know.

42:20.524 --> 42:22.651
What happened?

42:25.070 --> 42:28.240
It was the best I'd ever surfedag.

42:29.575 --> 42:33.537
A day like this you forget everything.

42:34.663 --> 42:38.626
I would not kill anyone. Not that day.

42:41.337 --> 42:44.006
I would only be in the water.

43:03.694 --> 43:06.822
Beautiful waves today, Mom.

43:29.888 --> 43:34.100
I think that we can call the detective and told about Miguel.

43:36.603 --> 43:39.022
Then he will be arrested.

43:42.859 --> 43:44.778
The ...

43:47.781 --> 43:52.161
- And she was released on bail. - Yes.

43:52.244 --> 43:57.333
So want to go to Mexico, for that is what they do.

43:57.416 --> 44:00.002
No crime zone.

44:18.230 --> 44:21.066
John. What happened, my brother?

44:21.149 --> 44:25.946
- Morning. - Council? Rincon tomorrow pump.

44:26.029 --> 44:31.452
- Yes. Here. - Good.

44:31.535 --> 44:34.246
- Thanks, man. - Does not matter.

44:34.371 --> 44:39.210
- Do you speak something about your cousin? - Transfer Listing every other Sunday.

44:41.003 --> 44:45.842
- If you ask how it is to sit in? - No waves.

44:47.343 --> 44:51.306
So you are planning to take advantage of it?

44:53.558 --> 44:56.269
- No ... - Do not be taken.

44:57.354 --> 45:02.693
Either way it's not so bad. He took the high school there.

45:03.777 --> 45:06.697
They have scholarships.

45:26.009 --> 45:30.847
I think you might use it again if I washed.

45:32.140 --> 45:35.268
- But it does not. - Mom ...

45:35.352 --> 45:39.022
- Give me your shirt. - I'm going to cry, but ...

45:39.731 --> 45:46.780
... I was not able to finish. I would wake up and realize that it is more.

45:55.664 --> 45:57.458
I love you.

46:13.850 --> 46:15.936
"I do not belong."

46:30.743 --> 46:35.748
- What the hell do you want? - Wash Mom t-jersey I got ...

46:35.831 --> 46:40.711
... When I find Ben. There was blood on the kitchen floor.

46:47.010 --> 46:49.053
Dave has utility in the house.

46:50.930 --> 46:53.433
This empty.

47:03.610 --> 47:05.571
Wow.

47:25.007 --> 47:27.719
It may be too low.

47:36.978 --> 47:39.648
Do I get it? Thank you.

47:45.195 --> 47:49.742
Here then? What are you thinking?

47:53.829 --> 47:55.956
What are you talking about?

47:57.249 --> 47:59.085
You know that.

48:02.964 --> 48:08.511
It is probably too high. I do not want to fall.

48:30.200 --> 48:32.536
Then here we go again.

48:38.584 --> 48:41.379
There is a disk.

48:42.088 --> 48:44.841
It is always a good choice.

48:46.092 --> 48:48.136
What do you think?

48:51.556 --> 48:54.017
I think so.

48:57.062 --> 48:58.897
It might be our best option.

49:01.316 --> 49:06.738
- What? - There is a lot to take in

49:06.822 --> 49:10.784
I love myself ..

49:12.369 --> 49:16.624
- I do not know what this means. - Yeah, so are you.

49:16.874 --> 49:20.795
- It is sick. - It is okay.

49:21.837 --> 49:25.633
- I see when you look at me and Ben. - What?

49:27.468 --> 49:30.930
When you are in a garage on the couch.

49:31.890 --> 49:37.145
We were with each other, and you stand there and then fight a long time.

49:37.228 --> 49:42.401
- I have to go now. - Do not go.

49:47.072 --> 49:49.658
I loved it.

49:51.702 --> 49:57.792
I like that you see us. I know do not know how to explain it.

49:59.752 --> 50:06.884
But for the first time for a long time ...

50:08.970 --> 50:12.390
... I feel like is not used.

50:49.637 --> 50:52.140
God ...

50:57.062 --> 50:59.731
god ...

51:01.775 --> 51:07.114
There are so many empty houses. Where is everyone?

51:07.364 --> 51:12.953
- Inland. - I have to stay at sea.

51:16.415 --> 51:21.045
- Will I see you tomorrow? - If you call him?

51:22.046 --> 51:24.382
Who?

51:25.675 --> 51:29.512
God, Miguel? Is that what this is about?

51:29.596 --> 51:36.186
- Say that you will meet on the beach. - It is not that.

51:36.269 --> 51:39.689
Yes, you can. You can get that at any time to do anything.

51:39.814 --> 51:43.944
- Not her. Do it now. - Donna, she killed my brother!

51:44.027 --> 51:49.032
Did he really say that?

51:49.116 --> 51:52.244
Let's just say you want to meet him in the parking lot noon.

51:52.328 --> 51:54.955
So you stay away.

51:58.584 --> 52:02.380
- What are you doing to me? - What do you want.

52:07.051 --> 52:10.054
- Did you bring me? - Yes.

52:10.138 --> 52:14.392
- How long? - As long as you want.

52:24.194 --> 52:27.114
Dad. Dinner is ready.

52:28.740 --> 52:31.118
No steak.

52:37.458 --> 52:39.877
Duduklah, John.

52:49.304 --> 52:51.890
You can not kill him.

52:53.475 --> 52:56.561
- Surely you know? - Yes.

52:58.188 --> 53:01.441
- I know it. - Anything I say, I ...

53:03.443 --> 53:08.031
I do not mean it. It was just talk, I do not mean it.

53:08.866 --> 53:11.118
I love you, Daddy.

53:15.998 --> 53:20.211
You are better than all of this, John. You are a good boy.

53:22.296 --> 53:27.719
I think we could ledge brother by opening the surf school.

53:29.178 --> 53:37.771
Ben Pipers surf school. We can get the kids out of town and teach them about the sea.

53:39.773 --> 53:42.192
- Here? - No.

53:43.235 --> 53:46.655
Malibu or south where it's safe.

53:48.323 --> 53:51.744
It is a good idea, Dad.

53:51.827 --> 53:54.371
Ben had quite liked it.

53:57.416 --> 54:01.087
What are you saying? What did you say?

54:02.672 --> 54:06.008
Wow, forget it.

54:38.334 --> 54:43.256
It is frightening how easy it is to kill someone.

54:45.091 --> 54:48.970
There you will find ... when you're doing.

54:50.638 --> 54:52.640
When the ball over my head.

54:52.724 --> 54:54.476
How are you?

54:54.726 --> 54:58.146
Wait and see. It was nothing, really.

56:03.631 --> 56:06.134
Mom, what happened?

56:08.344 --> 56:11.139
They come ... Donna and I.

56:13.391 --> 56:18.605
- Who? Is this Dad? - There is no danger.

56:20.315 --> 56:22.025
Why do you have a weapon?

56:25.779 --> 56:29.074
We solved it. I took care of it.

56:29.158 --> 56:32.244
- What do you mean? - That I shot Miguel.

56:35.372 --> 56:38.167
- Where? - In the parking lot.

56:39.502 --> 56:42.630
- Is he dead? - Yes.

56:44.507 --> 56:48.052
I do not think I would be that, but I just.

56:50.013 --> 56:52.307
Where is the father?

56:53.892 --> 56:57.062
- Poker di Scotty.
- Baik.

56:57.145 --> 57:02.400
- I must say that before I signed. - No, not the police.

57:02.484 --> 57:07.447
- Yes, Mom. Police. - No, I will not be in jail.

57:07.531 --> 57:12.453
- I have lost one of you. - I must.

57:12.536 --> 57:16.624
- Why? So someone in there? - Yes Ma'am. I saw it.

57:17.583 --> 57:19.376
I see it.

57:21.295 --> 57:28.469
It is ok. You can cry now, Mom. You can cry.

57:30.388 --> 57:34.768
Ben can rest in peace now. That may be what you want?

57:50.200 --> 57:52.661
Okay! Good!

57:54.246 --> 58:00.002
It's never good enough. You know what? Most proud Dad.

58:00.086 --> 58:03.881
- Donna attempted suicide today. - What?

58:03.965 --> 58:10.430
Vicky found the diary, they quarreled and he was found bleeding on the floor.

58:10.513 --> 58:14.934
- Is he okay? - No, obviously she did not have it.

58:17.270 --> 58:25.445
Listen. You can clear this before talking to Dad?

58:27.948 --> 58:32.411
- Yes, mother ... - I'm worried about Donna and me ...

58:32.661 --> 58:37.291
-... Will go. I understand? - Yes, just seared.

59:14.413 --> 59:20.294
- Vicky! Let me in! - Sorry.

59:21.671 --> 59:23.756
What are you doing?

59:28.428 --> 59:32.390
- I want no more children. - Run fast if you do not want Ã…ke into.

59:32.473 --> 59:36.728
- One can be inseminated. - Just run, Vicky.

59:36.811 --> 59:40.190
- I can have more children. - No, you can not ...

59:41.858 --> 59:47.906
You are a terrible mother. As bad as I do.

59:47.990 --> 59:52.494
Is It True? You are never more than Ben. It never felt better.

59:52.578 --> 59:55.581
You just have to deal with it.

59:56.790 --> 01:00:00.669
- Why? - Because there is no cure without scars.

01:00:00.753 --> 01:00:08.970
It was all of us. Two old scars to fat for our old jeans.

01:00:09.053 --> 01:00:13.892
- We have all been killed Donna. - That we did together.

01:00:32.828 --> 01:00:34.788
Mom!

01:00:46.717 --> 01:00:51.014
- Mom! Dad! - Let him remain conscious for the first.

01:00:51.097 --> 01:00:53.725
- I am calm. - Why did you hit me?

01:00:53.808 --> 01:00:56.603
Sit down.

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.730
What are you doing here?

01:01:00.106 --> 01:01:02.275
Fast, Vicky.

01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:07.531
- What the ... - He does not get into the house.

01:01:09.533 --> 01:01:14.496
But then he hit like if someone were to replace him.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.000
- He's going to kill himself, so ... - Tonight?

01:01:18.083 --> 01:01:22.922
- No... Juli 4.
- No

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:26.259
Fast, Vicky.

01:01:26.342 --> 01:01:33.558
He went to the beach, but then came Ben up full.

01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:41.608
He laughed and teased and sang "This is where the bride dressed in white."

01:01:41.691 --> 01:01:45.028
You know how fucking nasty he can be when he is drunk.

01:01:45.112 --> 01:01:48.699
Do not blame it on Ben.

01:01:48.782 --> 01:01:52.453
He will not kill him. It was an accident.

01:01:52.536 --> 01:01:55.664
He sifted and weapons away.

01:01:57.374 --> 01:02:00.544
You said you saw. That you see Miguel shot.

01:02:00.628 --> 01:02:05.049
- I see him go. - It's not the same, John.

01:02:05.132 --> 01:02:09.762
What is the difference? We kept it in the family.

01:02:09.846 --> 01:02:15.393
- I'll call the police. - You did it, I cried assault.

01:02:15.477 --> 01:02:21.066
- We do it my way, Trick. - Dad, I shot the wrong person.

01:02:21.149 --> 01:02:29.741
There is no danger, John. I finished it. I just need to be more aware.

01:02:29.825 --> 01:02:34.747
I took care of arms and body. We do not need the police.

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:38.292
Vicky and I did it together to save our children, -

01:02:38.417 --> 01:02:42.088
- So please remember that we keep this between us.

01:02:42.171 --> 01:02:47.218
Do not include me in the "we". I have nothing to do with this.

01:02:47.301 --> 01:02:52.515
I killed him ... I killed him without further ado.

01:02:53.474 --> 01:02:56.895
- Where is Donna? - He's not here.

01:02:56.978 --> 01:02:59.356
- This is nonsense. - He is not here!

01:02:59.606 --> 01:03:02.776
John! John, kembali! Neraka!

01:03:38.146 --> 01:03:41.316
- I'm going to grow hibiscus. - Where is the body?

01:03:41.399 --> 01:03:43.985
Where was never found.

01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:49.908
Have you thought about the river? All flushed up sooner or later.

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:56.206
- But then too late. - You know what I would say.

01:03:58.083 --> 01:04:03.839
When they catch you, John. Me too, and Donna and Vicky.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:08.928
Maybe your father too. So just call.

01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:17.062
Please, John. And when his mother would have spit on the grave ...

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:23.026
- I would not blame him. - No, I killed the wrong man.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:25.821
And everything else is just a bonus.

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:31.702
It happens to us all sooner or later. Welcome to the club.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:33.871
You'll get over it.

01:04:48.177 --> 01:04:54.767
Sorry, Dad. I'm not going to affect not, but I surrendered.

01:05:00.649 --> 01:05:02.859
It is the right thing.

01:05:04.736 --> 01:05:06.989
It takes balls.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.327
I hope that you got them from me.

01:05:16.206 --> 01:05:17.917
I will refresh me.

01:05:25.883 --> 01:05:32.307
I have been long enough to know that changes one's life forever.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:51.201
This is not what I want for you, but that's all it was.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:05.299
The police did not come after you here. While you can learn something.

01:06:32.327 --> 01:06:35.039
Donna sent a letter to me.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.212
I'm not a hero. I was just there.

01:06:54.183 --> 01:06:56.060
I do not see a lot of wars.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:06.363
Honestly ... I saw everything.

01:08:29.283 --> 01:08:32.953
Donna sent my diary before he killed himself.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:39.292
I had the same day because they found her dead.

01:08:41.837 --> 01:08:47.134
- She is a good girl. - Thank you for coming.

01:08:51.305 --> 01:08:53.808
Thank you.

01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:56.269
Where is he?

01:08:57.645 --> 01:09:01.441
His father home for burial tomorrow.

01:09:01.524 --> 01:09:06.238
Eventually I will let her dirty hands as well.

01:09:15.205 --> 01:09:20.211
Where is he? Everyone told me that she was a good girl.

01:09:20.294 --> 01:09:22.380
Pretend it's true.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.129
- Who is it? - I do not know ...

01:10:02.213 --> 01:10:05.132
... But Donna liked Mexico.

01:10:50.888 --> 01:10:53.016
Hello.

01:11:00.815 --> 01:11:05.237
- I hear that your stay with Gerry. - How many bills.

01:11:05.487 --> 01:11:08.323
Give me a minute, okay?

01:11:09.783 --> 01:11:12.578
I want you to know that you can always go home.

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:16.040
I have no home.

01:11:19.793 --> 01:11:23.672
I do not expect that you understand what I'm doing.

01:11:23.756 --> 01:11:30.513
Not now, but one day when you have kids. If so, you may call me.

01:11:31.764 --> 01:11:37.145
I will be a part of your life. When you come back.

01:11:46.488 --> 01:11:48.490
Hey, Dad.

01:11:54.872 --> 01:11:59.293
- Hello. How are you? - Good.

01:12:00.753 --> 01:12:04.548
- I can take care of their hands. - Good.

01:12:04.632 --> 01:12:11.597
- Do you take painkillers for it? - No, I survived.

01:12:11.681 --> 01:12:15.101
- Yes, it's probably for the best. - Yes.

01:12:16.102 --> 01:12:21.232
I have been aware for 287 days. Almost 10 months.

01:12:21.316 --> 01:12:24.402
- Is that true? - Yes.

01:12:27.447 --> 01:12:33.412
- Why are not you in Donnas it? - She and her mother ... you know.

01:12:34.663 --> 01:12:41.212
- I do not even know my wife. - Miguel's mother was at the funeral.

01:12:41.462 --> 01:12:45.633
I'll tell you what happened. I know where he lives, Dad.

01:12:45.716 --> 01:12:50.012
- Where? In Mexico? - Malibu.

01:12:50.096 --> 01:12:54.601
Donna knew it all along. He wrote in his diary.

01:12:56.227 --> 01:13:00.357
- Sounds like you'll be killed. - He deserves to know that, Dad.

01:13:04.861 --> 01:13:06.822
Juan, I took off the rest of the day. Should fix something with my son.

01:13:06.905 --> 01:13:10.033
- I'll go with you. - No.

01:13:10.117 --> 01:13:12.411
- I support you. - I have to solve this problem alone.

01:13:19.793 --> 01:13:26.676
I want to tell you that, so you know what I have in store.

01:13:32.724 --> 01:13:38.480
Besides ... it must just be a fight.

01:13:41.024 --> 01:13:46.196
Do not ask them for forgiveness, then you will not get.

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:54.204
Tell your story and ask them to listen. Do not start with what you have done, -

01:13:54.455 --> 01:13:59.335
- Without you and Ben. Tell all about Ben for them.

01:13:59.418 --> 01:14:06.968
Tell the whole family. Tell about your mother and father demanding DIN

01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:12.140
- Which is a damn drunks who have no use for you.

01:14:12.265 --> 01:14:15.977
Do it. Tell the whole story.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.648
Then they came to do one of two things.

01:14:20.732 --> 01:14:24.986
Do they kill you, or then leave you to the police.

01:14:26.363 --> 01:14:27.906
It does not end in any other way.

01:14:29.992 --> 01:14:32.786
And the story starts in the water, John.

01:15:07.697 --> 01:15:12.327
- Property Rivera. - Hey, I want to talk to Laura Rivera.

01:15:12.411 --> 01:15:14.830
He did not receive visitors.

01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:19.543
Can you tell him that I saw him at the funeral Donnas.

01:15:19.627 --> 01:15:21.504
Moment.

01:15:41.274 --> 01:15:44.236
- Go ahead, come in - Thanks ..

01:15:44.319 --> 01:15:46.738
She greets you here.

01:15:51.618 --> 01:15:54.788
- Do you want something? Mineral water? - No, thank you.

01:15:54.872 --> 01:15:58.000
Sit down. Ms. Rivera soon.

01:15:58.083 --> 01:16:00.211
Thank you.

01:16:11.556 --> 01:16:15.894
- If you make him angry? - No, I will not hurt him.

01:16:15.977 --> 01:16:20.857
I know you do not. I asked if it would make him angry.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.693
I just ...

01:16:26.738 --> 01:16:30.409
- Can I offer you something? - No, thank you.

01:16:30.492 --> 01:16:33.036
- You see my funeral certain Donnas. - Yes.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.707
- Are you a friend of Donna? - Yes.

01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:41.295
I'm sorry, I do not know him well. She is a lovely girl.

01:16:41.378 --> 01:16:45.132
- He knew my son. - I know.

01:16:45.216 --> 01:16:47.093
Do you know Miguel?

01:16:48.928 --> 01:16:50.805
Ya.

01:16:53.349 --> 01:16:59.773
He has been gone for almost a year. We have not heard from him. Do You Know?

01:17:03.526 --> 01:17:05.570
Ya.

01:17:06.613 --> 01:17:08.156
Do you know where he is?

01:17:12.202 --> 01:17:18.500
- I know what happened. - Happen? Is he alive?

01:17:24.548 --> 01:17:26.634
How do you know?

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:36.227
- I know, but not here. - Please, tell me now.

01:17:36.311 --> 01:17:40.148
No ... I have to show you something.

01:17:41.066 --> 01:17:44.236
I'll take you there and then informed.

01:17:46.029 --> 01:17:48.573
I had to change.

01:17:52.911 --> 01:17:55.581
- Does he know anything? - Yes.

01:17:55.664 --> 01:17:59.126
- I can get it from him. - No, I'm going with him.

01:17:59.209 --> 01:18:02.296
- I joined. - No, I do not know what I should do.

01:18:02.379 --> 01:18:08.052
- You do not go with strangers. - Charles, he was not even here.

01:18:22.859 --> 01:18:26.071
You are driving. Ms. Rivera sat in the back seat.

01:18:40.794 --> 01:18:46.884
Donna did the right thing. She asked her mother to say where the body was.

01:18:50.596 --> 01:18:52.682
It is here.

01:18:53.433 --> 01:18:57.520
Only when the fence ... that they know that the sand will cause the crowd Up

01:18:57.604 --> 01:19:00.690
- And he will be buried.

01:19:00.774 --> 01:19:03.443
Set my son buried here?

01:19:46.196 --> 01:19:48.740
I ...

01:19:50.617 --> 01:19:55.289
You will kill me how you want. Only I could see the sea.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.711
There, look at me.

01:20:02.922 --> 01:20:04.924
Look at me!

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:13.683
I want you to know who he is, so you know what you have taken from me.

01:20:15.351 --> 01:20:21.316
I'll tell you about the day when he was born, but I was drugged.

01:20:22.025 --> 01:20:28.323
I will tell about the first words, but I was in Paris with his glove

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:31.201
- And she with their caregivers.

01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:36.039
He played with the children in the street as if he is different from them.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:43.214
I hate to see him play with them.

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:49.178
How can I protect him if he can not protect themselves?

01:21:01.691 --> 01:21:05.570
- Did you kill her? - Yes.

01:21:08.365 --> 01:21:13.745
And mother, and Vicky, too? And left his body to rot in here-

01:21:13.829 --> 01:21:21.253
- And dumped his car in the river? Told you to be forgiven?

01:21:24.215 --> 01:21:29.845
- I do not know if it's possible. - Tell me what a good day for you.

01:21:33.599 --> 01:21:38.021
- What? - I will shoot you as you shoot.

01:21:41.232 --> 01:21:46.488
But I will kill you in a better way. I will wait for a good day.

01:21:46.571 --> 01:21:47.989
Maybe tomorrow.

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:54.121
Why kill you now that you are so depressed?

01:21:54.204 --> 01:21:58.000
I will kill you when you have something decent life.

01:21:59.418 --> 01:22:05.174
Then I'll find your mother, wife and your children.

01:22:05.257 --> 01:22:10.304
And I will confess them as you did to me!

01:22:12.306 --> 01:22:19.606
If you are lucky you die abroad. If you do not die on the day when you will live.

01:22:19.689 --> 01:22:22.692
Do you revenge I can wait that long?

01:22:25.987 --> 01:22:29.908
I think it can wait forever.

01:22:29.991 --> 01:22:34.955
Go ... before I change my mind.

01:23:10.534 --> 01:23:13.745
Five years later

01:23:13.829 --> 01:23:17.207
Hey, Dad. I will, I will.

01:23:18.834 --> 01:23:23.339
Man in gray suit could take you. Haier like small children.

01:23:23.422 --> 01:23:27.969
Well said, Dad. Sheila, no beer whenever there for John?

01:23:28.052 --> 01:23:30.137
It was a great day.

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:37.854
John, everything is fine. He noted in the water.

01:23:37.937 --> 01:23:39.439
Yes, the ban on your feet.

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:45.111
Do you talk to your dad? He refused to speak to me.

01:23:46.196 --> 01:23:47.989
He probably will not hit.

01:23:48.073 --> 01:23:52.244
Tell him that he welcome when he wants to.

01:23:55.455 --> 01:23:59.209
Do you feel good? Is that your hand?

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:07.927
Could not we have fun for one day at least?

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:11.222
- It may be raining. - It's not a cloud in the sky.

01:24:11.305 --> 01:24:15.101
I will listen to struggle in the car.

01:24:15.184 --> 01:24:18.771
No, do not come here. John!

01:24:19.022 --> 01:24:22.901
John, please, stay with us.

01:24:25.612 --> 01:24:29.157
- He had just returned from abroad. - Who are you trying to fool?

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.911
He was always like that.

01:24:33.305 --> 01:24:39.879
