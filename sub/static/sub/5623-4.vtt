29:49.280 --> 29:51.589
Move back, all of you.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.916
I'll do it, I swear to God.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.233
I said get back!

30:02.280 --> 30:05.955
I just need to phone the missus.
I'll see you next door in five. Yeah?

30:06.080 --> 30:08.230
(MUSIC OVER HEADPHONES)

30:14.320 --> 30:17.039
- We'll never speak of this again.
- Agreed.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.594
Whatever the opposite
of "bucket list" is, that's on mine.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.472
Let's just get Mary and go.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.589
Yep.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.150
God, I hope you know
what you're doing, man.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.349
OK, we're good.

30:54.360 --> 30:56.794
Mate, come on. We need to go...

30:57.040 --> 30:58.439
- (GROANS)
- No.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.195
Dave, no. We need to move now.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.229
Dave, you've taken worse than that one.

31:09.320 --> 31:12.437
Alright. Let's not do anything dumb,
here, Rhonda.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.313
Oh, I think we passed
through dumb a long time ago.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.269
Leanne.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.953
- Where's Leanne?
- Right here, darling.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.439
RHONDA: Uncuff her.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.148
Now! Now!

31:35.960 --> 31:38.793
So, that's what I'm talking about.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.434
Oh yeah, that's good stuff.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.393
You know what? I'm just going
to take this off you, as a thank you.

31:44.520 --> 31:48.957
Oh, now look at these good-Iooking cops
they've got around these parts.

31:49.080 --> 31:52.311
Is that a rifle you're pointing,
or are you just happy to see me?

31:52.440 --> 31:55.398
No one moves, unless I say so. OK?

31:57.840 --> 32:02.356
Um... You might want to tell
them to drop their weapons, hon.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.349
Right, yes.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.789
I should have said that earlier.

32:07.920 --> 32:11.595
- She's new.
- OK, you heard her. Drop 'em.

32:17.680 --> 32:21.593
Oh, yeah. Now, I had my eye on this one.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.951
This cost you a pretty penny,
I can tell you that much.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.072
I'm gonna have to get me
one of those government jobs.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.077
I'd join the FBI.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.752
Leanne, ideas?

32:39.120 --> 32:41.634
Oh, I can take it from here, sweet pea.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.031
Now, I've got
some bad news for you folks.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.470
The lady holding the gun to the kid's
head is the voice of reason

32:49.600 --> 32:51.238
in this scenario.

32:51.760 --> 32:56.834
But I'm Leanne, and we're gonna play
a little game, called Leanne Says.

32:56.960 --> 33:00.396
Rules? Real simple. I'm gonna say
something, and you're gonna do it

33:00.520 --> 33:02.272
or I'm gonna shoot you.

33:03.440 --> 33:08.798
First one. Leanne says:
Pop your trunk and drop your keys.

33:10.040 --> 33:14.079
Come on, hop to it, people.
I honestly ain't got all day.

33:15.160 --> 33:19.438
That's good. Come on, left side.
I'm not fucking around over here.

33:19.560 --> 33:22.597
Goddamn it.
That right side's putting you to shame.

33:25.320 --> 33:29.836
Alright. Leanne says:
All of y'all, get in your trunks.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.712
Now, that was kind of a giveaway.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.593
And why don't you stay put,
little Miss Priss?

33:37.120 --> 33:40.999
There you go. Yeah, that's good. OK.
Come on, come on.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.351
Look at this cute little couple.
This is just like <i>The Dating Game.</i>

33:44.480 --> 33:48.029
Y'all are gonna be engaged
to be married by the end of this shit.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.037
Good God!

33:50.160 --> 33:52.116
Oh, who have we here?

33:52.240 --> 33:56.074
Oh, now I don't want you guys
to become homosexual.

33:56.200 --> 34:00.352
So, you bear that in mind.
That's against God.

34:00.480 --> 34:03.756
- Oh, look at this.
- Rhonda, look at me.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.952
I've read your file. This isn't you.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.594
Well, that was like
taking candy from a baby.

34:09.719 --> 34:11.358
Apparently, it is now.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.717
You've got a boy, haven't you?

34:15.679 --> 34:18.558
Can you really bring yourself to do it?
Could you live with yourself?

34:18.679 --> 34:21.956
Oh my God. Shut up and get in the car.

34:22.080 --> 34:25.594
What are you doing? A monologue?
Rhonda McNeil, we did it.

34:25.719 --> 34:28.712
Whoo-hoo. We're like motherfucking
Starsky and Hutch.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.589
I'm sorry.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.800
(LEANNE WHOOPS) Yeah.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.674
(ALARM RINGS)

34:43.800 --> 34:45.518
No. No, no, no, no.

35:04.880 --> 35:05.869
Yes.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.274
OK. That's it.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.591
Oh, we've got to go. Come on.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.268
(ALARM RINGS)

35:26.520 --> 35:28.397
GUARD: Is that you, pal?

35:31.160 --> 35:32.275
- Yes.
- Hey!

35:33.240 --> 35:35.549
- What are you doing?
- You're joking.

35:38.120 --> 35:42.193
You. You. Out, now. Get out.

35:42.320 --> 35:45.198
I didn't stick my fingers
up his bum for this.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.072
- (ENGINE STARTS)
- Yes.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.673
(TIRES SQUEAL)

35:49.800 --> 35:50.789
Hey.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.235
Bring that back! Hey!

35:55.240 --> 35:56.434
Come back, you bastard.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.429
(TIRES SQUEAL)

36:24.520 --> 36:26.272
LARSSON: Needle?

36:26.400 --> 36:27.389
MOLBY: Yeah.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.396
LARSSEN: So, how do you want
to play this? Lost tourist?

36:33.680 --> 36:35.352
It's never failed us yet.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.311
(MOLBY LAUGHS)

36:41.360 --> 36:43.351
CHRISTOPHE: <i>We were all praying for you.</i>

36:43.480 --> 36:45.118
(APPLAUSE ON TV)

36:45.240 --> 36:46.753
He's taking all the credit.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.836
(CROWD CHEERS)

36:48.960 --> 36:50.871
Good. I don't want it.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.150
Jude, please talk to me.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.829
He scares me.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.310
Because he works for himself
and not the truth.

37:10.440 --> 37:14.752
The Church, the faithful...
They all want a Messiah.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.632
And the pressure is tremendous,

37:16.760 --> 37:19.194
and you have to have backbone
to stand up to that.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.590
Now, I'm not saying that I'm a good man.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.429
I've done things I'm deeply ashamed of.
But...

37:28.600 --> 37:30.238
I'm trying to do better.

37:30.560 --> 37:35.475
All I want from you is...
to be here in the morning to help me.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.475
You were right.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.592
Father Christophe...

37:43.120 --> 37:44.872
He's very, very punchable.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.230
Well, at least we agree on something.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.592
I'll see you in the morning.

37:54.480 --> 37:58.029
MAX: OK, long story short.
I did some pretty awesome shit,

37:58.160 --> 38:02.631
and I found him.
This is who's planning Saviour.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.228
And the backup plan.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.632
There's a bunker.

38:07.760 --> 38:11.070
- And this is the secret unit behind it.
- This?

38:11.200 --> 38:16.115
- Two guys round a kitchen table?
- The point is this guy.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.993
Scotty McNeil.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.110
- You are kidding.
- No. I checked his Facebook.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.310
It's the kid's freaking uncle.

38:26.440 --> 38:29.398
There are seven billion people
on this planet,

38:29.520 --> 38:31.511
and we've got this guy's nephew?

38:31.640 --> 38:36.430
I know, right? Which got me thinking.
Dude, what if this is more than chance?

38:36.560 --> 38:39.950
What if there's, like,
a higher power at work here?

38:40.080 --> 38:43.550
- Max, we're atheists.
- I know.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.796
But we were wrong
about the comet, right?

38:45.920 --> 38:50.232
I mean, you heard. They're looking
for people to go into a bunker.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.031
We're in his laptop now.
It's only a matter of time

38:53.160 --> 38:55.310
before we break
the encryption on his files.

38:56.440 --> 38:59.910
- It's, like, too good to be true.
- What are you saying?

39:00.040 --> 39:03.157
I'm saying, what if God exists?

39:04.280 --> 39:06.510
What if He wants us in that bunker?

39:07.640 --> 39:10.791
What if we are the chosen ones?

39:18.440 --> 39:22.319
LEANNE: You're lucky she's here, because
if it was up to me, I'd shoot you.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.558
But Rhonda is a good girl, and I think
you should know that about her.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.276
You have a good night now, ma'am.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.195
Feeling it now, huh? The guilt.

39:44.520 --> 39:45.794
You need to let me go.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.712
- And give yourself up.
- I can't go back to jail.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.831
You need to know I didn't
choose any of this.

39:54.960 --> 39:55.949
No, you did.

39:56.840 --> 39:59.195
You chose to point a gun at a child.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.513
That's who you are now.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.278
You've been hanging out
with your friend for too long.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.637
- Have a good night.
- You know I'm not gonna stop, right?

40:10.520 --> 40:11.714
I will find you.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.671
Oh, excuse me, Father.
Do you speak English?

40:49.800 --> 40:52.837
- I do.
- Oh, gosh. This is so embarrassing.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.757
I'm trying to find my hotel.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.917
I dumped my bags, went for dinner,
and I have no idea where I am.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.349
I think it's down here somewhere.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.550
Oh, mosquitoes out tonight, huh?

41:23.080 --> 41:24.877
MAX: <i>I'm gonna go see my family.</i>

41:25.280 --> 41:27.430
I haven't seen them since the comet.

41:27.560 --> 41:30.028
And I want to tell them
about the bunker.

41:30.160 --> 41:31.354
Oh.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.278
I mean, we shouldn't
just save ourselves, right?

41:34.400 --> 41:37.233
- Right.
- Just my mom and dad.

41:37.360 --> 41:41.512
And my sister. Maybe a few cousins.
I mean, that's OK, right?

41:41.640 --> 41:43.915
ARIEL: There's nothing more important
to me than family.

41:44.040 --> 41:47.589
Cool. I was worried you were
gonna be funny about it.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.069
- We're not gonna hurt the kid, are we?
- Of course not.

41:52.560 --> 41:56.189
The kid's the bargaining chip.
I need the kid.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.077
It's you I don't need anymore.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.428
(GUN FIRES)

42:10.080 --> 42:12.674
That's what happens to idiots.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.636
Don't be an idiot, Spike.
