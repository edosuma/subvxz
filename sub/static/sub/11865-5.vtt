01:07.724 --> 01:11.223
When I was a kid life
was all about what's next.

01:11.224 --> 01:14.924
I was, like, "seventh grade sucks.
Wait till I'm in eighth grade,"

01:14.925 --> 01:18.125
and then, "fuck eighth grade.
High school is going to rock."

01:18.325 --> 01:21.225
Life was one big race
to get to the next thing.

01:22.825 --> 01:26.226
Someone forgot to tell me
that the finish line was 18.

01:31.626 --> 01:33.626
There are people who are always on time.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.326
George, you're going to miss the bus.

01:35.327 --> 01:36.427
I hate those people.

01:36.927 --> 01:38.327
I was not on time...

01:38.427 --> 01:39.427
Books.

01:39.462 --> 01:41.227
Ever, for anything.

01:42.127 --> 01:43.727
I don't know what my deal was.

01:43.827 --> 01:45.328
I was late from the start.

01:45.528 --> 01:46.528
Where the hell is she?

01:46.628 --> 01:47.728
Late before the start.

01:47.928 --> 01:49.228
Oh, is that you, Georgia?

01:49.328 --> 01:52.728
Get... out... now!

01:57.129 --> 01:59.728
- Stop! Stop!
- Late was just who I was.

01:59.729 --> 02:01.629
Stop! Asshole.

02:02.529 --> 02:06.630
The thing about late is
you always feel, well...

02:06.930 --> 02:07.930
rushed.

02:08.130 --> 02:09.330
Late sucks.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.130
Yeah, well, you reschedule that, Diane,
because I'm making this flight, all right?

02:13.630 --> 02:16.130
No, I don't want to go
tomorrow. I want to go today.

02:16.230 --> 02:18.131
And when I get to Aruba, you
know what I'm going to do?

02:18.231 --> 02:20.831
Absolutely nothing. Okay?

02:20.931 --> 02:22.831
But I want e-mail in my hut...

02:23.231 --> 02:24.431
and a fax.

02:25.831 --> 02:26.831
No. No, no, no.

02:26.931 --> 02:30.132
You tell them to put
a fax in my hut. Okay?

02:30.632 --> 02:32.632
Can you move? Huh?

02:38.233 --> 02:39.633
Has anyone seen Kiffany?

02:39.733 --> 02:41.832
- Who are all these people?
- Why are they here?

02:41.833 --> 02:44.632
- And when will they go away?
- This is bullshit.

02:44.633 --> 02:46.233
I'm not going to wait around all day.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.133
I could, but...

02:48.734 --> 02:49.734
I won't.

02:50.334 --> 02:53.234
- Where are you off to?
- Post office.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.534
Read 'em... and reap.

02:59.735 --> 03:01.735
Oh, my god. I know this
guy. I know my reap.

03:02.435 --> 03:04.035
"H. Soriano."

03:04.535 --> 03:06.135
Your dear pal, "H."

03:06.735 --> 03:09.335
Harry? Henry? Hank? Hoho?

03:09.735 --> 03:10.736
Horatio?

03:11.536 --> 03:13.336
- That's all I got.
- Herman. - Shit.

03:13.636 --> 03:16.835
Herm works for mercury
messengers, and he used to,

03:16.836 --> 03:20.637
you know, do a bit of extra courier jobs
on the side, if you know what I mean.

03:21.637 --> 03:24.437
You know what I mean.
He owes me 200 bucks.

03:24.537 --> 03:25.836
Mercury messengers.

03:25.837 --> 03:27.437
They have that cute commercial.

03:27.937 --> 03:31.137
If you got a package
but you got no time,

03:31.238 --> 03:35.738
use mercury and you'll be just fine.

03:36.338 --> 03:38.738
- Mercury...
- Whoosh!

03:40.938 --> 03:42.939
A little early for the Andrews sisters.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.339
Hey, I reaped one of them.
I can't remember which one.

03:46.439 --> 03:48.839
This is all the way downtown,
and I want a blueberry muffin.

03:48.939 --> 03:50.239
I got to tell you something, Mason.

03:50.339 --> 03:53.040
I'm real tired of you showing
up by the skin of your teeth.

03:53.140 --> 03:54.940
- I get there, don't I?
- Barely.

03:56.340 --> 03:59.840
I look forward to the day when I see
you reaping like a fucking professional.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.140
With a scythe.

04:01.740 --> 04:05.041
- A watch would be a start.
- All right.

04:05.241 --> 04:08.141
I'll get there early. Fuck
the fucking blueberry muffins.

04:09.241 --> 04:13.541
I've been reaping earlier these
days. It's a lot less stressful.

04:13.641 --> 04:14.642
I never rush.

04:14.942 --> 04:17.442
If I see someone running, I
just assume they're a loser.

04:17.541 --> 04:19.541
- Unless they're a runner.
- Yeah, even then.

04:19.742 --> 04:20.942
Especially then.

04:21.442 --> 04:24.443
I'm not saying get there early.
I'm just saying don't be late.

04:25.343 --> 04:26.343
Bloody hell.

04:26.378 --> 04:28.242
Miss! Miss! Can we get
some service over here?

04:28.243 --> 04:30.343
I see you. I'll be
there in just a minute.

04:31.043 --> 04:32.243
What can I get for you?

04:32.343 --> 04:33.843
- French toast. - Blueberry muffin. -
Poached eggs. - Oatmeal with raisins.

04:34.643 --> 04:35.644
Let's try again.

04:35.844 --> 04:37.444
- French toast. - Poached eggs. -
Oatmeal with raisins. - Blueberry muffin.

04:38.144 --> 04:42.344
- I'll come back.
- No! I need oatmeal.

04:43.144 --> 04:45.545
Airport reap at rush hour.

04:45.945 --> 04:46.945
I'm boned.

04:47.145 --> 04:48.445
I know where Herm hangs out.

04:49.045 --> 04:50.045
I'll show Rube early.

04:50.145 --> 04:52.245
I'll get there so fucking
early, I'll reap him twice.

04:52.845 --> 04:55.345
I can't hang around either.
Are you coming, Georgia?

04:55.545 --> 04:57.045
I'm already late for work.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.946
20 minutes isn't going to kill me.

05:00.046 --> 05:01.046
Again.

05:02.146 --> 05:06.746
- How about some oatmeal this morning?
- Please. With raisins.

05:07.047 --> 05:08.347
On the house, sweetie.

05:08.547 --> 05:10.347
Good things come to those who wait.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.547
Where are my keys?

05:16.647 --> 05:19.848
- Reggie, have you seen my keys?
- No.

05:20.748 --> 05:24.348
- Where are my f-ing keys?
- Try your f-ing purse.

05:24.548 --> 05:26.748
Reggie, don't say "f-ing."

05:28.849 --> 05:31.248
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I have a meeting.

05:31.249 --> 05:32.249
Did you eat something?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.549
- With a...
- With a lawyer.

05:35.949 --> 05:37.749
Please eat something, hmm?

05:38.249 --> 05:39.250
Oatmeal?

05:39.650 --> 05:40.950
Oh, cereal. Fine.

05:41.150 --> 05:43.350
- Who's picking you up this morning?
- Mrs. Stuart.

05:43.850 --> 05:46.750
- Did you do something wrong?
- My divorce lawyer.

05:49.551 --> 05:51.951
- Is dad going to be there?
- Yes.

05:53.251 --> 05:56.250
I'm going to take you to band practice after
school, so don't dawdle on the way home.

05:56.251 --> 05:57.751
I don't want to be in the band.

05:57.851 --> 06:00.652
Reggie, please. Our agreement
was one school activity.

06:00.852 --> 06:02.951
- The band is for losers.
- Reggie.

06:02.952 --> 06:06.652
- My daughter is not a loser.
- I didn't say I was.

06:06.952 --> 06:09.852
All right, look, I can't have this
conversation right now. I'm late.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.153
So go.

06:11.753 --> 06:15.053
I paid for drum lessons and a band
uniform and you're joining the band.

06:15.253 --> 06:17.053
I'm not joining the f-ing band.

06:49.156 --> 06:50.156
Next.

07:00.457 --> 07:04.358
The nice thing about working at Happy
Time was that my day had its own rhythm.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.958
Sure, things got busy,
but the morning was mine.

07:07.158 --> 07:12.558
Show up late. Stare at screen.
Swivel chair. Sip coffee. Repeat.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.359
Stare at
screen. Swivel--

07:19.859 --> 07:23.258
- I need to give you a warning.
- What? I was on time. I'm working.

07:23.259 --> 07:25.260
You were not on time.
Check it out, Millie.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.760
Problem at 2 o'clock.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.960
That's 10 o'clock. No
wonder you're always late.

07:32.460 --> 07:35.160
- Who is it?
- Ed Barphin, management consultant.

07:35.260 --> 07:37.161
He's here to monitor
Happy Time's efficiency.

07:37.961 --> 07:39.661
I don't like anything about him.

07:40.361 --> 07:43.461
I'm going to tell you something
personal, and in the strictest confidence.

07:43.761 --> 07:45.961
Please, not anything about hygiene.

07:48.362 --> 07:49.462
I have a mole.

07:49.562 --> 07:50.562
Ew.

07:50.662 --> 07:52.162
Is it cancerous?

07:52.562 --> 07:54.462
Not that kind of mole, you silly goose.

07:54.562 --> 07:57.163
I know a muckety-muck in the
head office. He tells me things.

07:57.763 --> 08:01.063
- What kind of things?
- Corporate intrigue, Millie.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.563
- He knows what their plans are for me.
- He does?

08:07.664 --> 08:09.164
Should we give him a code name?

08:09.364 --> 08:10.964
- Who?
- My big mole.

08:11.064 --> 08:12.064
Ew!

08:12.664 --> 08:13.463
Sure.

08:13.464 --> 08:14.464
What should we call him?

08:14.864 --> 08:16.264
Moley Molerstein.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.465
Moley Ringwald.

08:19.665 --> 08:25.165
Fred... tells me I'm in line for a substantial
raise if they see I run an efficient ship.

08:25.465 --> 08:26.465
Great.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.164
What does that mean to me?

08:28.165 --> 08:30.766
- Work fast today. Crack the whip.
- I can do that.

08:31.466 --> 08:32.666
Oh, look at this guy.

08:33.066 --> 08:35.666
These management consultants,
they're all reapers.

08:36.666 --> 08:37.565
What?

08:37.566 --> 08:39.667
They hand out pink slips
like they're party favors.

08:39.767 --> 08:41.366
Can I count on you today, Millie?

08:45.167 --> 08:46.167
You can.

08:46.267 --> 08:49.267
I will kick some righteous
ass before the end of business.

08:49.567 --> 08:51.068
Praise the lord.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.468
How's everything going, ms. Herbig?

08:56.668 --> 08:58.968
Everyone calls me D.H. It's faster.

08:59.068 --> 09:01.569
Going great. Right, Millie?

09:01.669 --> 09:04.069
Right... D.H.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.369
Mm-hmm.

09:07.369 --> 09:08.969
More like B.S.

09:17.370 --> 09:19.370
Morning, Joy. Sorry to keep you waiting.

09:19.670 --> 09:21.170
As long as then meter isn't running.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.771
No, of course not. Uh,
can I get you anything?

09:23.871 --> 09:26.471
- Coffee? Tea? Water?
- Divorce, to go.

09:28.271 --> 09:29.571
I know this is hard.

09:30.271 --> 09:32.171
Expensive. Not that hard.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.572
Then today should be painless.

09:33.872 --> 09:36.672
All we need to do is go over the
final revisions with both parties,

09:36.772 --> 09:39.372
and then you sign on the dotted
line and you're done with him.

09:39.672 --> 09:40.772
- Good.
- Good.

09:42.572 --> 09:43.973
He's probably going
to be late, you know.

09:45.073 --> 09:46.873
Just because he knows it drives me nuts.

09:49.773 --> 09:52.173
May I ask you something
personal? Off the clock.

09:52.273 --> 09:55.074
- Sure, Karen.
- Why are you still wearing your ring?

09:58.074 --> 09:59.574
Because I'm not divorced.

10:01.174 --> 10:03.674
You people have your
rituals, and I have mine.

10:06.275 --> 10:08.575
- Mind if I start the clock?
- Start the clock.

10:11.475 --> 10:14.275
Herm... where the fuck are you, Herm?

10:29.377 --> 10:30.377
'Sup?

10:30.677 --> 10:31.677
What's up?

10:32.977 --> 10:34.277
What's happening?

10:36.578 --> 10:38.278
Do any of you chaps know an H. Soriano?

10:38.378 --> 10:40.878
He's a skinny dude with
a couple of tattoos?

10:41.178 --> 10:43.178
We're all skinny dudes
with a couple of tats.

10:43.978 --> 10:44.978
Yes, you are.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.478
Yes.

10:46.678 --> 10:48.778
Is it possible that Herm
goes by another handle?

10:48.779 --> 10:50.779
Handle? We're not truckers, man.

10:51.379 --> 10:53.479
Look, I need to find Herm, now.

10:54.079 --> 10:55.479
I know he hangs out here.

10:56.879 --> 10:58.980
I owe him money. I have
to give it to him now.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.280
Chill, dude. Herm's on his way.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.180
Herm. Herm!

11:08.281 --> 11:09.381
H... oh, sweet christ.

11:19.982 --> 11:22.082
What do you know? You don't ever forget.

11:25.382 --> 11:26.382
I'm okay.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.083
Good morning.

11:35.683 --> 11:36.883
How are you this morning?

11:38.183 --> 11:39.583
No habla ingles.

11:39.984 --> 11:41.484
Have you ever been to Hawaii?

11:42.084 --> 11:43.184
Ay, dios mio.

11:43.284 --> 11:46.584
I just got back from a vacation in
Hawaii. I'm here to pick up my mail.

11:47.284 --> 11:50.284
You know, I thought it was
going to be sunny, but it rained.

11:50.484 --> 11:52.085
My son took me on a cruise.

11:52.185 --> 11:54.684
All the shrimp you can eat
at every meal, even breakfast.

11:54.685 --> 11:55.785
Are you mexican?

11:56.785 --> 11:59.385
- Actually, I'm from New York.
- I've never been to New York.

11:59.485 --> 12:03.085
I don't think I'd like it, though, all those
tall buildings and everyone running around.

12:03.086 --> 12:04.986
Although I would like
to meet Matt Lauer.

12:05.086 --> 12:07.586
You look a little like
him, only older and angrier.

12:14.287 --> 12:15.887
Have you ever been to Hawaii?

12:25.088 --> 12:26.088
Sweetheart.

12:26.188 --> 12:29.288
God love you for coming. You're
going to have a fabulous time.

12:29.488 --> 12:32.688
- I'm sure I will, Sherri.
- Let's get you a name tag.

12:33.889 --> 12:37.589
I feel like a christian in the
coliseum. What exactly is going on here?

12:39.389 --> 12:42.589
Pretty and funny. The whole package.

12:42.689 --> 12:44.990
You're going to kill in
there. Tell me your name, doll.

12:45.190 --> 12:48.990
- Um, Daisy. Daisy adair.
- Oh. First names only.

12:49.090 --> 12:50.690
Discourages the stalker element.

12:50.890 --> 12:52.090
Daisy.

12:53.590 --> 12:55.391
Right. Here we go.

12:56.691 --> 12:58.891
Break some hearts.

12:59.791 --> 13:01.591
I'm returning Lydia's call.

13:02.291 --> 13:03.991
It's Millie from Happy Time.

13:09.592 --> 13:12.891
Hi, Lydia. You've
temped for them before.

13:12.892 --> 13:18.893
There's a dress code, and your skirt
needs to actually cover your ass.

13:20.293 --> 13:24.993
I don't care where your tattoo is.
You cannot show crack at the office.

13:29.494 --> 13:31.294
I have to call you back.

13:33.894 --> 13:36.494
May I help you with
something, mr. Barphin?

13:36.795 --> 13:38.395
Was that call of a business nature?

13:38.495 --> 13:41.695
The way D.H. runs things around
here, there isn't any another kind.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.295
- May I ask you a question?
- That is a question.

13:44.495 --> 13:46.095
Would you like to ask me another one?

13:46.595 --> 13:50.396
Do you routinely use off-color language
as part of your business lexicon?

13:50.496 --> 13:54.995
Sometimes off-color language is the
most efficient way to convey an idea.

13:54.996 --> 13:57.396
As in, "get the fuck
away from my cubicle."

13:57.896 --> 14:00.397
- I have an observation.
- L.T.H.I.

14:01.697 --> 14:02.697
Love to hear it.

14:04.797 --> 14:08.196
When you make a call, you do not need
to say, "returning so-and-so's call."

14:08.197 --> 14:10.098
You can just say,
"returning." Saves time.

14:10.298 --> 14:12.798
I wanted to ask, "saves time for what?"

14:12.998 --> 14:13.998
But I just said...

14:14.033 --> 14:15.498
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

14:17.798 --> 14:20.899
Save your fucking breath, you worm.

14:22.999 --> 14:25.199
Welcome to "make your move."

14:25.299 --> 14:26.899
Each date is two minutes.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.900
No talk about work,
and first names only.

14:30.100 --> 14:34.400
- Okay. Make your move!
- Wow.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.000
Daisy. Hello, Daisy.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.601
Prettiest flower in the garden.

14:42.001 --> 14:44.001
So, Daisy, we've only got two minutes.

14:44.601 --> 14:46.001
Anything you want to ask "the kid?"

14:46.501 --> 14:50.701
Yes, um... what's, uh...
what's your last name?

14:51.602 --> 14:55.102
Babe, last names spell commitment.

14:55.502 --> 14:57.502
I'm all about the here, the now,

14:57.902 --> 15:00.102
the you and me attacking
some bedsprings.

15:02.603 --> 15:03.903
Last name.

15:05.103 --> 15:06.103
Mandell.

15:11.603 --> 15:12.704
This is fun.

15:14.504 --> 15:17.204
Sweetie, no physical
threats to the gentlemen.

15:17.304 --> 15:18.904
I need the repeat customers.

15:19.304 --> 15:20.304
I'm new.

15:20.604 --> 15:21.604
Okay.

15:25.705 --> 15:26.504
Okay, okay.

15:26.505 --> 15:27.805
Walk me through my spa treatments.

15:29.105 --> 15:30.105
Yeah.

15:30.705 --> 15:31.705
Uh-uh.

15:32.305 --> 15:34.106
No, not the mud wrap.

15:34.506 --> 15:35.806
I want the hot rocks.

15:36.106 --> 15:39.006
No need to travel 4,000 miles to
have somebody shove mud up my ass.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.206
Come on!

15:40.606 --> 15:42.406
Come--
Move it!

15:53.307 --> 15:57.808
Passengers arriving on
flight 127 from Hong Kong

15:57.908 --> 16:00.608
may pick up their baggage
from carousel number one.

16:08.209 --> 16:10.508
Mrs. Williams, your
children have been found...

16:10.509 --> 16:11.408
Excuse me.

16:11.409 --> 16:12.308
Hello.

16:12.309 --> 16:13.909
Can I get everybody's attention?

16:14.009 --> 16:14.908
Excuse me, ma'am.

16:14.909 --> 16:16.210
Can I get everybody's attention?

16:16.310 --> 16:17.910
My name is William Garratt,

16:18.010 --> 16:22.910
and it is my pleasure to address the baggage
situation on flight 127 from Hong Kong.

16:23.010 --> 16:25.210
If I do not get my trunk, I am fucked.

16:25.410 --> 16:27.211
Do you understand? Fucked.

16:27.311 --> 16:32.111
Yes, ma'am, I do, but I also
understand that anger and foul language

16:32.211 --> 16:35.311
is not going to make this
process go any faster,

16:35.811 --> 16:38.312
and when you get your trunk and
you're on your way in a few minutes,

16:38.512 --> 16:41.212
you might be wondering
why you made such a fuss.

16:41.312 --> 16:43.011
I have been waiting here one hour!

16:43.012 --> 16:46.112
Ma'am, can you step back and calm down?

16:47.212 --> 16:49.013
Because I'm getting
ready to do my thing.

16:50.613 --> 16:51.913
One...

16:52.413 --> 16:53.413
two...

16:53.513 --> 16:54.513
three.

17:03.014 --> 17:05.614
Earpiece to the baggage
handlers on the tarmac?

17:06.214 --> 17:08.714
So you didn't buy my
zen-like calm, huh?

17:08.814 --> 17:10.615
I bought your zen-like calm.

17:11.015 --> 17:12.915
I just didn't buy the magic trick.

17:14.015 --> 17:15.714
Listen, I don't mean to alarm you,

17:15.714 --> 17:18.115
but I need to see your
passenger manifest, please.

17:18.214 --> 17:21.616
Sweetheart, only a gun
to my head would alarm me,

17:21.715 --> 17:22.816
and not even then.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.416
Excuse me.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.617
I need the following passengers
to identify themselves, please.

17:35.217 --> 17:36.817
Passenger Jones.

17:38.917 --> 17:41.218
Passenger Thibodeaux.

17:45.618 --> 17:48.718
Thank you for your cooperation,
and have a nice day,

17:49.118 --> 17:50.218
and thank you, sir.

17:50.418 --> 17:51.317
Thank you.

17:51.318 --> 17:52.319
Excuse me.

17:54.919 --> 17:56.819
May I see your passport, please?

17:57.219 --> 17:58.619
It's just a routine check.

17:59.419 --> 18:00.618
Because this is what I need.

18:00.619 --> 18:03.520
More stupid americans to
keep me from where I'm going.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.720
Everyone's doing what they can to
get you where you're going, miss.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.820
You just need to stay calm.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.821
Calm is for losers. I have places to go.

18:14.021 --> 18:16.821
Then you go, baby. Allez, allez.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.121
Tu es vraiment une vache, hein ?

18:26.622 --> 18:30.022
- Jeff... Allen?
- No.

18:30.422 --> 18:32.622
We shouldn't waste time,
Jeff. You and I? No connection.

18:32.822 --> 18:33.822
What?

18:34.022 --> 18:35.423
I don't like moustaches.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.122
Oh. No. I don't even really like it.

18:38.123 --> 18:39.523
I was planning on shaving it.

18:39.723 --> 18:41.923
Seriously. I almost shaved
it off right before I came.

18:42.023 --> 18:44.423
Even if you shaved
it, I'd always see it.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.324
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:46.424 --> 18:49.423
Dating, it's all about first
impressions, snap judgments,

18:49.424 --> 18:52.624
and this, Jeff, this thing between
you and I, it's not powerful.

18:52.724 --> 18:54.324
This is not meant to be.

18:59.925 --> 19:00.925
Nice meeting you.

19:11.526 --> 19:12.526
Hi.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.326
Um, this is it.

19:18.827 --> 19:20.127
Reggie's band uniform.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.327
You told me to pick it up.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.927
- How does it look?
- It's pretty adorable.

19:24.127 --> 19:26.327
- Does it have one of the hats?
- Oh. Yeah.

19:26.927 --> 19:28.428
Chin strap and everything.

19:28.528 --> 19:30.028
Oh, my god.

19:32.328 --> 19:36.128
Epaulets. Epaulets.
Couldn't you just die?

19:39.129 --> 19:42.929
Okay, we're all here. Let's get going.

19:46.929 --> 19:48.329
I have copies for everyone.

19:49.430 --> 19:50.629
If you'll just take a minute,

19:50.630 --> 19:54.230
you'll notice the revisions are in
bold, and if there are any questions--

19:54.330 --> 19:55.930
You're taking Reggie for Christmas?

19:56.130 --> 19:58.230
Well, we're going to
Mexico for Thanksgiving.

19:58.930 --> 20:00.131
Terrific.

20:00.531 --> 20:02.931
Where are you going? Going to Cancun?

20:03.431 --> 20:06.131
Does it really matter
where I'm going? I'm going.

20:06.731 --> 20:09.431
So I get Reggie for Thanksgiving,
when she hates the food?

20:09.831 --> 20:11.332
That's just the way it worked out.

20:11.432 --> 20:14.132
So you get to have our daughter on
the holiday when she opens presents,

20:14.232 --> 20:16.631
and I get her for the
one where she throws up?

20:16.632 --> 20:17.632
What do you want, Joy?

20:22.233 --> 20:23.433
Can I borrow your pen?

20:24.433 --> 20:26.033
The fancy one in your
pocket. Do you mind?

20:29.833 --> 20:31.234
Be my guest.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.934
You can use mine if you like.

20:36.434 --> 20:37.434
Thank you.

20:46.535 --> 20:48.935
- Hello there, Jack.
- Right.

20:49.035 --> 20:51.134
So, are you having some nice dates?

20:51.135 --> 20:52.936
Are you trying to dump me already?

20:53.136 --> 20:54.636
No, just making chit-chat.

20:55.736 --> 20:57.736
I bet you're dying to
date that hump over there.

20:59.536 --> 21:02.236
Well, he is handsome, but I look
for many other qualities in a man.

21:02.336 --> 21:03.536
Is your last name Allen?

21:03.537 --> 21:07.737
I know for a fact that
that guy has herpes. Fact.

21:07.837 --> 21:09.137
Easy there, tiger.

21:09.237 --> 21:11.237
- You despise men, don't you?
- What?

21:11.337 --> 21:13.937
You come here because you hate men.

21:13.938 --> 21:16.438
You're a beautiful woman who hates men.

21:16.738 --> 21:18.737
God, I hope your last name's Allen.

21:18.738 --> 21:19.738
It's not.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.338
All the women I know hate men.

21:22.738 --> 21:24.539
No, they just hate you.

21:26.439 --> 21:29.539
Marty, call the messenger service,
find out what's keeping them.

21:29.639 --> 21:32.739
Stephanie, the copier
needs toner, and...

21:33.039 --> 21:34.039
you.

21:35.640 --> 21:36.640
I don't know your name.

21:36.675 --> 21:38.340
I'm the sandwich boy.

21:39.040 --> 21:42.739
Well, sandwich boy,
where are the sandwiches?

21:42.740 --> 21:43.740
In reception.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.841
Are there hungry people in reception?
No, they're in here, starving.

21:51.941 --> 21:54.541
The Ted has not been given an task.

21:54.741 --> 21:56.242
The Ted is taskless.

21:56.342 --> 21:58.942
The Ted is to remain with Millie.

21:59.142 --> 22:01.341
The Ted must make Millie laugh.

22:01.342 --> 22:04.442
Keep your station tuned to channel
Ted. It's all Ted, all the time.

22:04.542 --> 22:07.443
- T-n-T. Ted 'n'
ted-- - Ted on mute.

22:08.343 --> 22:10.943
I felt a little like
Rube handing out post-its.

22:11.243 --> 22:13.942
Like death, we were on
a pretty tight schedule.

22:13.943 --> 22:17.043
Let's go ! Let's go ! Don't
dilly-dally. Time is money, people.

22:17.444 --> 22:19.944
I can't believe I just
said, "dilly-dally."

22:20.444 --> 22:21.544
I feel dirty.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.944
I don't like these stamps.
Do you have something else?

22:28.045 --> 22:30.044
I remember something
with Amelia Earhart.

22:30.045 --> 22:32.645
- I loved her.
- I reaped her.

22:48.846 --> 22:52.447
While everyone may agree that
time flies when you're having fun,

22:52.747 --> 22:56.647
it is a little-known fact that
even when you're not having fun,

22:56.747 --> 22:58.347
time still can fly...

23:03.248 --> 23:05.148
and it flies coach.

23:40.251 --> 23:41.851
This is a joke, right?

23:49.952 --> 23:51.052
So, what was my time?

23:53.853 --> 23:54.853
Nice.

23:56.353 --> 23:58.353
And even though times knows how to fly,

23:58.653 --> 24:01.953
it remembers how to crawl.

24:02.553 --> 24:03.754
Hi.

24:05.054 --> 24:06.554
Can I cut in? Excuse me.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.854
- You look great.
- Thank you.

24:08.954 --> 24:10.354
What a day I've had.

24:10.854 --> 24:12.354
Would you hold my spot, please?

24:13.254 --> 24:15.755
Afternoon, ladies. Are
you two old friends?

24:16.355 --> 24:18.455
Uh, her daughter's in my son's class.

24:19.455 --> 24:20.855
I have a question for you.

24:21.555 --> 24:23.455
Is everyone in this line an asshole?

24:24.255 --> 24:25.456
Excuse me?

24:25.756 --> 24:27.656
Is everyone you just cut
in front of an asshole?

24:28.756 --> 24:29.756
No.

24:29.791 --> 24:30.956
So it's just you, then?

24:31.456 --> 24:33.056
I have children in the car.

24:33.756 --> 24:35.056
I got a cake in the oven.

24:35.657 --> 24:38.257
He's got three minutes left on the
meter. She's got a lunch meeting.

24:38.957 --> 24:41.557
We all have a finite amount of time.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.057
Now, get in the back of the line,

24:46.858 --> 24:49.358
and don't use your children
like that. It's shameful.

24:59.459 --> 25:02.459
It's been said that time
and tide wait for no man.

25:02.859 --> 25:04.159
Neither does Daisy.

25:05.659 --> 25:07.058
A word about the ascot.

25:07.059 --> 25:10.460
You need to be really stylish
or really rich to pull that off,

25:11.260 --> 25:12.760
or are you gay?

25:20.461 --> 25:21.461
No.

25:23.861 --> 25:24.861
No.

25:26.361 --> 25:28.662
I smell an obsession with UFOs.

25:30.662 --> 25:33.862
- I'm not obsessed with UFOs.
- Okay.

25:34.562 --> 25:36.162
But I did come here in one.

25:36.662 --> 25:37.662
Big one.

25:38.262 --> 25:40.363
Big one. Wow.

25:51.264 --> 25:54.263
Yo, cup o' noodles.
Let's move it along here.

25:54.264 --> 25:55.764
The Ted has low blood sugar.

25:56.164 --> 25:57.564
Shut up, Ted.

25:57.864 --> 26:01.165
The Ted will ignore what he would
normally take to be fighting words.

26:01.265 --> 26:03.465
The Ted needs to chill.

26:24.467 --> 26:25.867
I'm okay.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.767
Je n'ai pas encore ma valise.

26:28.267 --> 26:30.067
Oui. Ca fait une heure que je suis ici.

26:30.467 --> 26:32.167
Just hand your ticket to
that gentleman over there,

26:32.267 --> 26:33.468
and you can be on your way.

26:35.668 --> 26:37.868
Man, you got the patience of job.

26:39.868 --> 26:42.068
The airport's not a happy
place for a lot of people,

26:42.568 --> 26:43.569
but I'm happy.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.969
I believe that tends
to rub off on people.

26:46.969 --> 26:48.069
I wouldn't know.

26:48.569 --> 26:49.769
I don't work that way.

26:50.169 --> 26:52.769
You're shoot first and ask
questions later, aren't you?

26:53.369 --> 26:54.570
I really am.

26:55.070 --> 26:57.669
Well, I believe that
it's harder to be happy

26:57.670 --> 26:59.570
when you have a gun on your belt.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.570
Makes anger a much easier choice.

27:02.670 --> 27:05.771
- You used to be on the job?
- No.

27:06.071 --> 27:07.571
Not your job. No.

27:08.671 --> 27:11.971
I wasn't always a... calm man.

27:12.771 --> 27:13.871
People suffered.

27:15.072 --> 27:16.072
You know what I'm saying?

27:16.672 --> 27:17.872
I think I do.

27:23.972 --> 27:26.073
It was really good meeting you, William.

27:26.273 --> 27:27.373
Nice to meet you, officer.

27:33.073 --> 27:34.073
Next.

27:34.473 --> 27:35.372
Afternoon.

27:35.373 --> 27:37.174
Afternoon. I'm here
to pick up a package.

27:37.874 --> 27:39.374
- I'll just take a minute.
- Take two.

27:44.074 --> 27:47.875
- Well, this is interesting.
- What's that?

27:48.275 --> 27:50.275
This has been in the dead
letter office for a while.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.076
Why didn't this get
to where it was going?

27:58.376 --> 27:59.476
I wouldn't know that, sir.

28:01.476 --> 28:02.976
Well, this was sent a long time ago.

28:03.076 --> 28:05.276
- Perhaps the people moved.
- No, they didn't move.

28:05.676 --> 28:06.676
I don't know what happened, sir.

28:06.776 --> 28:08.477
I wasn't there. This
is almost 80 years...

28:09.277 --> 28:10.277
80 years old.

28:11.877 --> 28:13.177
This is unacceptable.

28:13.277 --> 28:15.777
Sir, it might be unacceptable,
but it is the way it is.

28:15.877 --> 28:17.177
It was in the dead letter office.

28:17.277 --> 28:20.178
It took a long while to make its
way back, but now you have it.

28:20.478 --> 28:21.678
Well, this is a mistake.

28:22.178 --> 28:23.178
It came back.

28:27.678 --> 28:29.879
This is a terrible mistake.

28:32.579 --> 28:36.279
On behalf of the U.S. Postal system,
I apologize for any inconvenience this

28:36.379 --> 28:38.079
might have caused you or your family.

28:40.580 --> 28:41.880
You have no idea.

28:56.581 --> 28:58.681
- Hi, James.
- Hi, Daisy.

28:58.781 --> 29:00.581
What's your last name, James?

29:01.782 --> 29:03.482
Bond. James bond.

29:06.082 --> 29:07.482
I thought that might be funny.

29:07.582 --> 29:09.282
No, it's funny. It's
funny. I just, um...

29:10.582 --> 29:11.783
I've been here a while.

29:12.383 --> 29:14.483
Yeah, me too. 17 times, actually.

29:14.783 --> 29:15.783
Wow.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.983
You must be getting very good at it.

29:18.183 --> 29:20.383
I'm terrible. No one
ever writes me down.

29:21.483 --> 29:23.484
Well, maybe you just
haven't met the right girl.

29:24.884 --> 29:26.384
Are you the right girl, Daisy?

29:29.484 --> 29:31.084
I know, two minutes is tough.

29:31.684 --> 29:33.885
Everyone likes to talk,
and I like to listen.

29:34.785 --> 29:38.085
I guess it's hard to remember
someone who just listens.

29:39.285 --> 29:40.885
Well, I'll remember you.

29:43.185 --> 29:44.486
I hope so, Daisy.

29:44.986 --> 29:46.386
I've really
enjoyed spending--

29:46.586 --> 29:48.686
Make your moves, speed daters! Hurry up.

29:51.286 --> 29:52.386
See you, James Bond.

29:52.886 --> 29:53.986
My name's not really Bond.

29:54.287 --> 29:56.887
- I know.
- It's Allen.

29:59.287 --> 30:00.887
Daisy, you have a really nice smile.

30:01.587 --> 30:03.187
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.690
Everyone says live in the now,

30:30.590 --> 30:31.890
but that's bullshit.

30:32.490 --> 30:34.190
I mean, who lives in the moment?

30:36.991 --> 30:39.491
We're too busy thinking
about what happens next...

30:42.691 --> 30:44.891
or what didn't happen at all.

30:50.392 --> 30:52.592
Have I ever sat in an
aisle seat, Diane? Huh?

30:52.692 --> 30:55.492
Business class, right
side window, bulkhead.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.191
What are you, new? Huh? Let's go.

30:57.192 --> 30:59.693
Let's make things happen
here, Diane. Come on.

31:02.393 --> 31:03.393
Come on.

31:05.393 --> 31:07.393
I know it doesn't seem like it, but

31:08.894 --> 31:10.494
you are in good hands.

31:40.597 --> 31:41.997
Oh, come on, now, lady.

31:44.297 --> 31:45.997
You can't do that, ma'am.

32:05.599 --> 32:06.599
Zut alors.

32:06.899 --> 32:08.599
This is very inconvenient.

32:09.399 --> 32:10.899
Lady, you're dead.

32:10.999 --> 32:11.798
Yes.

32:11.799 --> 32:15.100
And I am sure there are many other dead
people up there trying to take my place.

32:15.900 --> 32:16.900
Let's go.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.600
C'est la vie.

32:25.301 --> 32:29.301
Watching a really efficient system in
action sometimes just knocks you out,

32:30.801 --> 32:32.901
and sometimes it just makes you sick.

32:38.702 --> 32:39.702
The time card.

32:39.902 --> 32:42.502
Makes it a snap to monitor
everyone's comings and goings.

32:42.602 --> 32:44.803
People are working, and when
they're not, you know about it.

32:45.403 --> 32:46.903
I love it.

32:47.603 --> 32:48.603
It's not very...

32:49.003 --> 32:49.902
personal.

32:49.903 --> 32:50.903
Exactly.

32:50.938 --> 32:53.403
It reduces the amount of time you
need to talk to your employees.

32:53.703 --> 32:54.904
Well, that's just...

32:55.404 --> 32:56.404
fantastic.

33:03.904 --> 33:04.904
On the clock.

33:05.304 --> 33:06.805
Always on the clock.

33:07.205 --> 33:09.905
No matter how quickly
everyone did their job today,

33:10.405 --> 33:14.605
someone somewhere would be
punching out before 5:00.

33:17.606 --> 33:19.706
Come on, Reggie. Let's see.

33:20.106 --> 33:21.306
I'm not going.

33:22.506 --> 33:24.806
Let me just see what it looks like.

33:25.206 --> 33:26.606
I look like a geek.

33:26.907 --> 33:27.706
All right.

33:27.707 --> 33:29.107
I know that is not true.

33:30.507 --> 33:33.107
Look, I paid good money for this.
You have to at least show me.

33:34.407 --> 33:35.407
Now.

33:37.708 --> 33:38.708
Please?

33:44.408 --> 33:45.408
Oh.

33:48.409 --> 33:50.209
You are so cute.

33:51.109 --> 33:52.109
Blah.

33:53.009 --> 33:55.009
- I'm taking a picture.
- No way.

33:55.059 --> 33:55.789
Oh, yeah.

33:55.790 --> 33:56.508
No, too late.

33:56.509 --> 33:57.709
I have to get a camera.
Just stay right there.

33:58.109 --> 33:59.110
I hate this.

33:59.145 --> 34:01.310
Stay right there before it
gets all crumpled up in the car.

34:10.411 --> 34:11.811
Shut up.

34:14.011 --> 34:17.011
All right. Now, I want
one with the hat on...

34:19.110 --> 34:20.112
Reggie?

34:21.512 --> 34:22.512
Aw...

34:48.614 --> 34:50.014
Well, someone's popular.

34:50.214 --> 34:51.815
You're going to be a very busy girl.

34:52.114 --> 34:53.114
Busy, busy, busy.

35:09.016 --> 35:10.016
James.

35:10.516 --> 35:11.516
James.

35:14.317 --> 35:15.817
Nobody wrote my name down.

35:16.817 --> 35:17.817
I did.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.117
You were just trying to be nice.

35:21.317 --> 35:22.917
No, I really liked you.

35:23.417 --> 35:24.418
I liked you too.

35:25.518 --> 35:26.818
You'd really go out with me?

35:27.518 --> 35:28.518
Sure.

35:28.718 --> 35:29.918
In a New York minute.

35:33.218 --> 35:36.119
Who ever thought of the concept
of knowing someone in two minutes?

35:36.219 --> 35:37.219
Yeah.

35:37.619 --> 35:39.319
It takes even less time than that.

35:41.519 --> 35:43.119
Why don't you come with me, James?

35:59.321 --> 36:00.321
I didn't jump.

36:01.921 --> 36:02.921
I slipped.

36:05.521 --> 36:07.322
I'm waiting for our date, sir.

36:15.622 --> 36:17.923
You were the most beautiful woman there.

36:19.023 --> 36:20.023
I know.

36:24.423 --> 36:26.523
See, we're not too late.
Everyone's still getting there.

36:27.023 --> 36:28.824
I don't want to do
it. I want to go home.

36:30.824 --> 36:32.624
You're going to have fun.

36:34.124 --> 36:35.124
You don't know that.

36:35.324 --> 36:38.025
See, if you keep waiting
on the sidelines...

36:38.725 --> 36:41.625
this is a really... precious time.

36:42.725 --> 36:44.925
I don't... I don't
want you to be left out.

36:45.825 --> 36:50.026
I want to just... help
you run in there. You know?

36:50.726 --> 36:52.926
George wouldn't have put
this crappy uniform on.

36:57.326 --> 36:58.826
I... I don't know.

37:00.427 --> 37:02.127
I don't want to wear glasses anymore.

37:02.427 --> 37:03.226
What?

37:03.227 --> 37:05.027
Everyone calls me Harriet Potter.

37:05.627 --> 37:06.627
I don't like it.

37:07.827 --> 37:09.027
Okay.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.028
Is there any... anything
else you want to...

37:13.828 --> 37:15.128
you want to tell me?

37:16.228 --> 37:17.228
Anything?

37:18.028 --> 37:20.729
We could just take a little minute.

37:21.029 --> 37:22.629
Forget it. I'm late.

37:24.229 --> 37:25.329
Reggie!

37:27.629 --> 37:28.629
What?

37:28.729 --> 37:31.130
Don't just run across the
street without looking.

37:31.230 --> 37:33.530
Jesus fucking christ! What the
hell were you thinking about?

37:38.730 --> 37:40.630
I'm sorry. Reggie, I'm sorry.

37:42.331 --> 37:46.131
Just... just... just please be careful.

37:46.631 --> 37:47.530
Okay.

37:47.531 --> 37:48.531
Hey.

37:50.531 --> 37:52.231
Can I just take one picture?

37:53.632 --> 37:55.032
You look so beautiful.

37:55.832 --> 37:56.832
I'm late.

38:08.433 --> 38:10.033
Oh, my god. What have I done?

38:22.634 --> 38:23.734
I'm a stupid man.

38:30.535 --> 38:31.535
What's up, dude?

38:32.735 --> 38:33.735
Herm.

38:34.035 --> 38:35.436
Mason, Mason.

38:35.536 --> 38:36.936
Mason, you don't look so good, man.

38:37.136 --> 38:38.136
I'm okay.

38:39.836 --> 38:41.036
I owe you some money, don't I?

38:41.536 --> 38:42.736
Herm, Herm, Herm, Herm.

38:43.836 --> 38:44.836
Don't worry about it.

38:45.036 --> 38:46.037
Don't worry about it?

38:46.237 --> 38:47.837
That doesn't sound
like the Mason I know.

38:48.037 --> 38:49.137
You sure you're all right, man?

38:49.337 --> 38:51.237
I'm all right. I'm
just taking a breather.

38:51.637 --> 38:53.137
Yeah? A breather from what?

38:54.037 --> 38:55.337
From being me.

38:55.537 --> 38:57.338
Come on, man. Get up out of that gutter.

39:01.338 --> 39:02.338
Thanks, mate.

39:04.138 --> 39:05.238
You sure you don't want this money?

39:05.538 --> 39:07.239
I'll tell you what. I got some speed.

39:08.739 --> 39:10.839
I'll give you the
money. You buy the speed.

39:11.139 --> 39:13.239
I don't want it. Honestly.

39:13.639 --> 39:14.639
All right.

39:15.239 --> 39:17.039
Look, I got to go, man. I
got to get to the next drop.

39:17.239 --> 39:18.840
Dude forgot his sticks, man.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.540
- Take care.
- I will.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.140
Hey, Mason.

39:23.140 --> 39:25.340
What do you call a guy who
hangs out with three musicians?

39:26.040 --> 39:27.040
I give up.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.641
The drummer.

39:29.941 --> 39:31.241
Later, man. I got to scramble.

39:51.643 --> 39:52.643
Dude.

39:52.743 --> 39:53.743
Dude.

40:01.044 --> 40:02.744
Psst. Psst. Hey, hey, hey.

40:05.144 --> 40:07.244
I think it's going
really well, don't you?

40:08.144 --> 40:09.144
I guess.

40:09.544 --> 40:10.945
Um, I have a doctor appointment.

40:11.045 --> 40:13.645
Oh, fine. I can just smell that raise.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.345
You've really hustled today,
Millie, and I appreciate it.

40:16.445 --> 40:19.844
Don't you think things
were a little strange today?

40:19.845 --> 40:22.146
- I don't know what you mean.
- Never mind.

40:22.246 --> 40:24.645
I mean, I know we've picked up the
pace, but you know what they say.

40:24.646 --> 40:27.446
"If you're skating over thin
ice, you'd better go fast."

40:27.646 --> 40:30.146
What if we just avoided
the ice altogether?

40:30.446 --> 40:32.247
Yo, Millie. What up, dawg?

40:32.447 --> 40:33.647
Yo, Ted.

40:34.847 --> 40:37.747
So, Delores, when do
I get my last check?

40:37.847 --> 40:39.447
- In about a week.
- What?

40:39.847 --> 40:41.447
I fired Ted.

40:42.047 --> 40:43.048
I'm toast.

40:43.348 --> 40:44.448
Burnt toast.

40:44.948 --> 40:46.348
Hasta luego, Ted.

40:46.948 --> 40:48.147
Tedmeister, over and out.

40:48.148 --> 40:49.548
Check, please, for the tedster.

40:50.248 --> 40:53.149
- Why did you fire Ted?
- Stay out of it, Millie.

40:53.249 --> 40:57.949
Fine, he's a little different,
but is that any reason to fire him?

40:58.549 --> 40:59.549
Ted's funny.

41:00.049 --> 41:02.749
Maybe he doesn't get as much work
done around here as everyone else,

41:02.849 --> 41:05.250
but at least he makes life a
little more fun around here.

41:05.350 --> 41:06.850
That has to stand for something.

41:06.950 --> 41:08.450
The Ted is dead.

41:09.050 --> 41:12.350
Oh... is the ted drunk?

41:14.251 --> 41:15.251
Ted...

41:20.451 --> 41:21.551
Goodbye, Ted.

41:23.451 --> 41:24.751
Millie will miss you.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.952
When I was alive, I
didn't care about time.

41:29.352 --> 41:30.752
I didn't think about it,

41:32.152 --> 41:34.452
and I guess that's why
I was always late...

41:36.553 --> 41:38.553
but since I died, it's weird.

41:39.253 --> 41:40.753
I guess I want to be more...

41:41.753 --> 41:42.753
on time.

42:15.056 --> 42:16.056
Whoo.

42:16.256 --> 42:17.756
What did you do? Knock over a bank?

42:18.857 --> 42:19.857
No.

42:20.957 --> 42:22.257
Is this real money?

42:23.157 --> 42:24.157
It was,

42:24.957 --> 42:25.957
many years ago.

42:27.857 --> 42:28.858
Are you okay?

42:31.258 --> 42:32.558
Just a long day.

42:34.758 --> 42:36.458
Have you handled your post-it yet?

42:37.758 --> 42:38.958
I'm on my way.

42:39.359 --> 42:40.359
Don't be late.

42:42.459 --> 42:43.459
I won't be.

42:47.659 --> 42:48.759
Do you want a ride home?

42:49.759 --> 42:50.760
I'll walk.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.060
Rube.

42:55.560 --> 42:56.560
Thanks.

43:05.261 --> 43:08.061
I heard it a million times
when I was growing up.

43:08.261 --> 43:09.461
"Hurry up, Georgia."

43:09.561 --> 43:11.062
"Seize the day, Georgia."

43:12.862 --> 43:16.662
And no matter how fast I went,
I just kept falling behind.

43:17.062 --> 43:19.262
I just kept getting later and later,

43:20.462 --> 43:23.363
and the whole time, I was
thinking, "what's next?"

43:25.163 --> 43:27.263
I couldn't wait for what's next.

43:28.663 --> 43:33.164
Maybe people should just find
one pretty spot and stay there.

43:35.964 --> 43:37.764
The funny thing is when you die,

43:37.864 --> 43:39.964
everyone refers to you as "late,"

43:40.764 --> 43:45.265
but now I know that's the one event
that always happens right on time.

43:45.965 --> 43:47.465
What the fuck? Another red light?

43:48.865 --> 43:51.364
Diane. Diane. Overnight
the bag, all right?

43:51.365 --> 43:52.365
I don't give a shit.

43:52.465 --> 43:54.566
Look, just solve the problem.

43:54.666 --> 43:56.166
I'm 10 feet from the airport.

43:57.166 --> 43:58.566
This is fucking ridiculous.

44:00.966 --> 44:02.366
Hey. Hello.

44:02.466 --> 44:04.167
Could you push the
little button right there?

44:04.567 --> 44:05.567
What?

44:06.567 --> 44:09.867
Push the button right--the
walk... call me back.

44:12.967 --> 44:13.967
Fuck.

44:22.868 --> 44:24.668
Once is enough.

44:24.968 --> 44:25.868
You know what?

44:25.869 --> 44:27.469
I don't have time for
this shit, all right?

44:38.970 --> 44:41.270
You can come this way. I'll show you.

44:43.270 --> 44:44.570
I'm going to need a minute.

45:00.472 --> 45:01.972
Let me know when you're ready.

45:02.572 --> 45:03.872
I guess there's no hurry.

45:04.305 --> 45:10.508
