00:05.340 --> 00:08.480
The raid boss is in there, isn't it?

00:08.480 --> 00:09.730
So it seems.

00:12.550 --> 00:14.940
We'll have plenty of work for you later.

00:14.940 --> 00:15.620
Sure.

00:16.090 --> 00:17.820
I'll be waiting.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.620
Only fifteen minutes and 
thirty seconds until moonrise!

00:22.270 --> 00:24.440
Begin the operation.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.770
So you're here, adventurers?

02:03.920 --> 02:05.320
Engage!

02:05.320 --> 02:06.640

02:38.970 --> 02:43.100

02:50.240 --> 02:52.110
Look at all of them!

02:52.470 --> 02:55.370
Their individual levels aren't an issue, but...

02:55.740 --> 02:58.700
Their numbers and locations are the problems.

02:59.050 --> 03:02.450
Shiroe's group will draw all of the 
enemies from around the area.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.600
Using an enchanter as a tank?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.440
That's crazy!

03:06.440 --> 03:08.040
The enemies are all lined up.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.010
Let's tear them apart!

You're getting into this, Shouryuu.

03:37.930 --> 03:40.490
That's most of the ones in front, Shiro!

03:40.870 --> 03:43.200
You have paper-thin armor, Shiro.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.710
You shouldn't be doing this.

03:44.710 --> 03:46.750
I've done kiting before.

03:47.090 --> 03:48.420
I'll manage.

03:48.420 --> 03:51.940
We can't do it like Demikas, 
but let's finish this!

03:53.170 --> 03:54.740
More enemies from 4 o'clock!

03:54.740 --> 03:55.590
Six moon rabbits!

03:56.020 --> 03:57.180
Can you do it, shrimp?

03:57.560 --> 03:59.890

04:05.670 --> 04:07.310
W-Wow.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.770
We will protect my lord.

04:10.910 --> 04:11.650
Stop it!

04:11.650 --> 04:12.810
I wanna do that, too!

04:13.120 --> 04:16.430
Akatsuki's gotten even better, hasn't she?

04:16.430 --> 04:17.580
Yeah!

04:19.050 --> 04:21.050
Shiro's serious about this now.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.410
Then I have only one job!

04:26.030 --> 04:27.190
<i>Ikkigake!</i>

04:29.590 --> 04:31.290
This is the big show.

04:31.290 --> 04:32.790
Go, Souji!

04:37.740 --> 04:39.450
The raid boss has started moving.

04:39.450 --> 04:40.170
Shiroe,

04:40.660 --> 04:43.830
party 2's assault team has 
engaged the enemy leader!

04:44.490 --> 04:46.240
Finally time for the boss, huh?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.180
Head straight to the roof!

04:53.170 --> 04:54.120
Soujirou!

04:54.120 --> 04:56.040
Shiro, good work back there.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.810
We warmed him up for you, Shiroe.

04:58.220 --> 04:59.900
Whoa, is that him?

04:59.900 --> 05:00.690
That's...

05:01.630 --> 05:03.790
<i>His name is Taliktan,</i>

<b>Genius of Summoning

<i>His level is 86.</i>

05:07.660 --> 05:08.750
<i>He's raid rank.</i>

05:09.150 --> 05:10.700
<i>His level isn't that high...</i>

05:11.380 --> 05:14.710
<i>But our levels are all over the place,

<b>Nazuna        Nyanta        Soujirou</b>

05:20.620 --> 05:24.220

05:23.060 --> 05:24.220
<i>Anchor Howl!</i>

05:24.560 --> 05:26.110
So that's a Genius...

05:26.110 --> 05:28.220
There are nine minutes and 
forty-seven seconds left!

05:26.470 --> 05:28.220
<i>Gaia Wind Healing!</i>

05:28.680 --> 05:31.720
All will fall asleep.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.720
Why?

05:33.720 --> 05:35.230
Why are you doing this?

05:35.460 --> 05:38.690
All will fall asleep!

05:40.490 --> 05:42.230
We can't talk about this?

05:42.490 --> 05:45.510
Fall asleep, adventurers!

05:45.890 --> 05:47.280
He's just like Camaysar.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.980
There's no way to talk to them...

05:49.980 --> 05:52.370
We're talking past each other.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.890
Shiro, I can't keep this up!

05:55.300 --> 05:56.250
What do we do, Shiro?!

05:56.800 --> 05:58.530
Everyone attack.

05:59.510 --> 06:02.980
All will fall asleep.

06:02.980 --> 06:07.380
All will fall asleep! Fall asleep!

06:12.230 --> 06:13.800
N-No...

06:13.800 --> 06:14.640
Why?

06:17.520 --> 06:19.650
All parties, hurry and get set up!

06:20.000 --> 06:23.640
The moon isn't up, but they're back.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.650
If you don't fall asleep, their dust will 
hit you with another status effect,

06:27.130 --> 06:28.410
so be careful!

06:30.560 --> 06:31.750
Shut up, Demi!

06:31.750 --> 06:33.080
You need to...

06:33.700 --> 06:37.080
Finish this fast, Shiroe!

06:41.960 --> 06:43.590
Those damned Odyssey Knights!

06:44.060 --> 06:47.140
The jerks are making our lives harder.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.840
All will fall asleep.

06:51.190 --> 06:55.500
All will fall asleep!

06:53.460 --> 06:54.360
Shiro!

06:54.630 --> 06:55.440
Look!

06:55.800 --> 06:57.350
If we let this continue,

06:57.830 --> 07:01.550
the antenna will shatter before 
we can do anything about it!

07:02.290 --> 07:05.060
Party 1, raise your DPS and maintain aggro.

07:05.380 --> 07:08.580
Get him away from the antenna 
and down into the hall below!

07:09.310 --> 07:11.530
Parties 2 through 4, deal with the adds,

07:11.530 --> 07:13.030
and then meet up with us!

07:13.330 --> 07:14.670
By "hall," does he mean that thing?

07:14.670 --> 07:15.990
We're really high up.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.370
<i>Aggro Exchange!</i>

07:20.270 --> 07:20.870
Now!

07:21.320 --> 07:23.130
Party 1, move to the hall!

07:24.470 --> 07:25.880
Look! Look!

07:26.180 --> 07:28.280
It's a flying idol!

07:39.960 --> 07:41.760
We've lowered his HP by forty percent.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.250
But his dodge rate has suddenly shot up.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.150
Sleep, and your safety will be assured.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.190
Waves will return to waves,

07:51.190 --> 07:53.330
and particles to particles.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.660
Give me your souls,

07:56.090 --> 07:59.400
and I promise you safety and return.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.830
The sleep of the eternal moths?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.420
What do you people know?

08:03.420 --> 08:07.380
Those who agree to the contract 
and hand over their souls

08:07.790 --> 08:11.440
are to allow access and 
choose to stand by in sleep!

08:11.440 --> 08:13.450
That light is bad!

08:13.450 --> 08:14.930
Insta-kill AoE!

08:15.630 --> 08:16.610
Split up!

08:19.860 --> 08:20.830
Nyanta!

08:20.830 --> 08:21.870
What is this?

08:21.870 --> 08:23.560
We were far away from that!

08:23.580 --> 08:30.070
<b>Party 1     Party 2     Party 3      Party 4</b>

08:23.850 --> 08:26.910
This is the attack that hit us.

08:26.910 --> 08:30.070
It can't be dodged, and it selects targets randomly?

08:30.070 --> 08:35.740
Fall asleep and choose, adventurers!

08:39.620 --> 08:40.360
Crap!

08:43.650 --> 08:44.830
You saved me!

08:44.830 --> 08:46.000
That's my job!

08:46.330 --> 08:47.270
Are you okay?

08:47.270 --> 08:48.010
Marie!

08:47.670 --> 08:48.380
Thank you.

08:48.010 --> 08:49.440
Boot-Up Heal everyone!

08:50.200 --> 08:50.770
Tetra...

08:50.770 --> 08:52.010
Leave it to me!

08:52.700 --> 08:54.020
We can still do this!

08:54.020 --> 08:56.260
You can do this, so do it!

08:56.850 --> 08:58.670
<i>Aurora Heal!</i>

08:59.500 --> 09:02.830
Front ranks for parties 1 and 2, 
increase DPS to the limit!

09:02.830 --> 09:05.590
Nazuna's group, put a barrier 
on each of them in order!

09:05.590 --> 09:06.810
You got it!

09:05.590 --> 09:06.810
Roger!

09:06.810 --> 09:08.230
What are you going to do?

09:09.030 --> 09:12.190
Everyone else, keep your HP up 
and attack in waves!

09:12.190 --> 09:15.610
Sleep... Sleep!

09:17.680 --> 09:22.580
<b>Genius of Summoning

Sleep, and I promise you safety and return.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.090
That AoE is coming back.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.440
If we get attacked now...

09:44.660 --> 09:47.350
We survived it with Boot-Up Heals and barriers?

09:48.250 --> 09:50.920
You knew who it would attack?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.360
I figured it out the second time.

09:52.850 --> 09:56.550
It's a penetration attack on 
the threat table's top five.

09:57.830 --> 10:03.870
So it targets those who generated the 
most aggro during its cool down?

10:04.940 --> 10:06.680
<i>In this crazy battle,</i>

10:06.680 --> 10:10.380
<i>he kept track of every skill the raid 
used and the damage they did?</i>

10:11.210 --> 10:13.620
<i>Even though we've never fought together before?</i>

10:13.620 --> 10:15.510
Parties 3 and 4, draw the tentacles' attention.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.660
Parties 1 and 2, attack the main body.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.720
<i>And our MP isn't as low as I thought.</i>

10:18.850 --> 10:20.800
Wolfie, go!

10:22.740 --> 10:23.790

Leave this to me, Shiro!

10:35.510 --> 10:38.330
We know what we need to do.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.910
So finish this, Shiroe!

10:41.380 --> 10:42.030
Minori!

10:42.550 --> 10:44.540
You're in charge of parties 3 and 4!

10:45.400 --> 10:46.170
Right!

10:48.200 --> 10:50.040
I was arrogant.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.490
What's wrong?

10:51.870 --> 10:53.780
Everyone flattered me and said

10:53.780 --> 10:56.700
I was a strategist and the 
training squad's leader, but...

10:57.190 --> 10:59.210
I have a long way to go.

11:00.510 --> 11:03.380

<i>Frost Spear!</i>

11:11.030 --> 11:12.230
Sleep...

11:14.740 --> 11:17.990
Stand by within the peace.

11:17.990 --> 11:21.640
The beach where my lord and I 
walked wasn't like that.

11:22.290 --> 11:25.300
Our memories weren't stolen.

11:25.830 --> 11:29.790
We offered them up and made them 
into the power to rise again.

11:30.530 --> 11:33.710
We shattered the fragments of the past 
and turned them into the power to rise!

11:34.230 --> 11:37.810
You are models with no power.

11:36.550 --> 11:37.810
<i>Anchor Howl!</i>

11:38.840 --> 11:40.450
<i>We're greedy.</i>

11:44.550 --> 11:45.620
<i>Singularity.</i>

11:47.510 --> 11:51.050
<i>I have my friends and a place to strive for.</i>

11:51.920 --> 11:53.170
<i>Infinity Force!</i>

11:53.570 --> 11:54.280
All right!

11:55.170 --> 11:57.830
<i>We have people waiting for us!</i>

11:58.360 --> 12:00.640
<i>Thorn Bind Hostage!</i>

<i>Merciless Strike!</i>

12:04.390 --> 12:06.240

12:18.810 --> 12:20.590

12:21.040 --> 12:23.500
Way to go, villain in glasses.

12:29.810 --> 12:30.570
I see.

12:30.570 --> 12:31.480
Got it.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.320
Yeah, we're finished here.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.860
The Calling Fortress, huh?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.690
It sounds like a fun place to try and raid.

12:41.090 --> 12:42.450
You...

12:42.450 --> 12:44.780
Darling, why are you crying?

12:44.780 --> 12:46.960
I-I'm not crying!

12:46.960 --> 12:47.870
I'm drooling!

12:48.460 --> 12:51.090
My eyes are drooling!

12:51.090 --> 12:51.930
There, there.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.620
Jeez, get a room, you two.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.060
My blushing pinkie has a hangnail...

12:57.630 --> 13:02.130
<b>Day 1
Tetra's Recital!</b>

12:58.060 --> 12:59.800
Is it because they defeated the raid boss?

13:00.390 --> 13:02.130
Things seem different.

13:02.490 --> 13:06.170
I guess we saved both the antenna 
and the world, huh?

13:06.170 --> 13:06.870
Yes.

13:07.230 --> 13:11.390
A fine example of "two birds with one stone."

13:11.770 --> 13:15.840
Still, I can't believe there's 
communications equipment here.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.360
It's probably because we defeated Taliktan.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.420
The weird parts are still a game.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.070
That's my line.

13:24.710 --> 13:25.960
Don't get mad.

13:25.960 --> 13:26.950
You're such a kid.

13:27.950 --> 13:29.050
Well?

13:29.050 --> 13:30.550
I understand...

13:31.120 --> 13:33.250
Okay, there we go!

13:33.630 --> 13:35.140
Are we connected?

13:35.140 --> 13:36.610
With the moon?

13:38.520 --> 13:42.160
He...o... An...ybod... hear ...e?

13:42.160 --> 13:44.230
Is it Princess Kaguya?

13:44.230 --> 13:45.720
Ni hao?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.190
Bonjour?

13:46.370 --> 13:48.510
Hello? Can you hear me?

13:47.190 --> 13:48.100
Aloha?

13:48.100 --> 13:49.470
Guten tag!

13:48.510 --> 13:49.470
Hello?

13:51.310 --> 13:52.790
That voice...

13:52.790 --> 13:54.350
Is that you, Shiro?

13:55.410 --> 13:57.510
Don't tell me...

13:57.510 --> 13:59.190
I knew it!

13:59.190 --> 14:00.990
Yoo-hoo, Shiro!

14:00.990 --> 14:01.820
Kanami?

14:02.050 --> 14:04.190
K-Kanami?

14:04.190 --> 14:05.550
It can't be—

14:05.550 --> 14:07.660
Shiroe's ex-girlfriend!

14:08.000 --> 14:09.330
It's been so long!

14:09.330 --> 14:10.820
How have you been?

14:10.820 --> 14:12.880
Don't "It's been so long" me!

14:13.500 --> 14:18.130
I heard you're doing something 
interesting in Akihabara.

14:18.130 --> 14:20.090
Um, what was it?

14:20.590 --> 14:22.090
Round robin?

14:22.090 --> 14:23.250
The Round Table.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.930
How did you know about that?

14:26.330 --> 14:29.010
And wait, did you come back to the game?

14:29.320 --> 14:31.160
And wait, where are you?

14:31.160 --> 14:33.280
She's not on the moon, is she?

14:33.280 --> 14:34.890
She might be...

14:36.770 --> 14:39.500
This is the China server.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.520
Okay, that's the last one.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.470
Everyone's okay, right?

14:43.810 --> 14:45.580
Hey, Kanami!

14:45.580 --> 14:46.780
We're done!

14:47.190 --> 14:51.610
I'm on a journey, and I found this TV station.

14:51.610 --> 14:54.890
It looked interesting, so I fiddled with 
some stuff, and it connected.

14:55.490 --> 14:57.350
Because it looked interesting?

14:57.350 --> 14:59.000
Oh, right... Shiro!

14:59.930 --> 15:02.500
My daughter's three now.

15:04.410 --> 15:05.530
Daughter?

15:05.530 --> 15:07.010
She has a daughter?

15:08.600 --> 15:09.930
I know.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.050
I'm sorry I never got to congratulate you.

15:15.310 --> 15:16.870
Did I tell you?

15:16.870 --> 15:17.960
No.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.770
But I heard.

15:20.760 --> 15:21.690
So I'll say it now.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.390
Congratulations.

15:23.760 --> 15:24.760
Thanks!

15:24.760 --> 15:26.280
You have a kid?! Seriously?

15:26.600 --> 15:30.570
And she's so cute!

15:30.570 --> 15:31.830
She moves around so much.

15:31.830 --> 15:36.440
She'll run up to you and then cling to your leg!

15:36.440 --> 15:37.470
I see.

15:38.880 --> 15:43.180
Then you need to go home 
to our old world, right?

15:43.440 --> 15:45.270
Huh? Why?

15:46.830 --> 15:48.060
Hey, Shiro!

15:48.060 --> 15:52.720
I want to show this world to my daughter.

15:54.530 --> 15:59.500
It's so big and so pretty and so wonderful.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.730
And her mom has lots of friends here.

16:02.090 --> 16:05.240
I want to send her on an adventure where 
she'll meet people all over the world.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.590
She loves high places.

16:08.590 --> 16:10.300
So I want to let her ride a griffon.

16:10.710 --> 16:13.890
I want to show her the great forests 
and the seas and the deserts.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.990
I want to teach her that the 
world is a beautiful place!

16:21.760 --> 16:22.560
Yeah...

16:22.970 --> 16:23.980
That's true.

16:24.630 --> 16:25.630
You're right.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.760
It's not that I'd never considered the possibility.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.660
I'd just given up on it as impossible.

16:34.270 --> 16:36.000
Instead of going home

16:36.680 --> 16:38.800
or staying here,

16:40.210 --> 16:41.760
there's a third option.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.400
Connect the two worlds

16:46.240 --> 16:49.900
and make it so you can travel between them.

16:52.660 --> 16:55.230
Is that possible?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.540
It's worth trying, I think.

16:58.120 --> 17:04.170
But didn't you say the adventurers 
might cause a war here?

17:04.510 --> 17:07.920
That doesn't mean going home 
is necessarily the best option.

17:08.310 --> 17:09.760
That's just what I'd expect.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.920
That's my lord.

17:12.360 --> 17:15.890
Then go get it done, Shiro!

17:16.390 --> 17:17.700
Is that a quest?

17:17.700 --> 17:19.030
Yes, that's right!

17:19.030 --> 17:19.920
A quest!

17:20.230 --> 17:21.020
No.

17:21.020 --> 17:23.370
What? Shiro!

17:23.370 --> 17:26.880
Kanami, I made a guild.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.160
It's called Log Horizon.

17:29.650 --> 17:31.610
I have lots of friends.

17:33.940 --> 17:37.450
So we'll accept that quest.

17:39.630 --> 17:43.520
We'll be the first in the world to see that.

17:44.140 --> 17:46.750
But since we're old friends,

17:46.750 --> 17:50.070
if you hurry, there may be time 
for me to show it to you.

17:51.650 --> 17:52.800
Shiro...

17:53.860 --> 17:56.100
There's an answer that doesn't

17:56.100 --> 17:58.020
involve giving up on this world

17:59.070 --> 18:00.470
or the old one.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.970
Find it. Promise.

18:03.670 --> 18:08.530
Log Horizon accepts your quest.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.110
That's my bus guide!

18:12.450 --> 18:14.380
Bus guide?

18:14.680 --> 18:16.080
Oh, right...

18:16.080 --> 18:18.640
Crusty's here, too.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.670
Crusty's there?

18:22.930 --> 18:24.080
M-My lord?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.840
What?!

18:26.340 --> 18:27.720
What do you mean?

18:27.050 --> 18:29.430
My lord... My lord...

18:27.720 --> 18:29.430
Crusty's there?

18:29.430 --> 18:32.900
Yeah! And he said—

18:34.290 --> 18:37.090
I didn't do anything...

18:41.680 --> 18:44.950
Hey! Shiro! Hello?

18:43.120 --> 18:44.950
You'll break it! You'll break it!

18:44.950 --> 18:48.230
I see Shiroe is as interesting

18:48.680 --> 18:49.890
as ever.

18:49.890 --> 18:51.510
Interesting?

18:51.510 --> 18:56.860
So, who will be the one that comes to get me?

18:57.130 --> 18:59.210
Misa or Rieze?

18:59.550 --> 19:02.870
Kanami's friends are all so unique.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.750
Jeez...

19:05.750 --> 19:08.870
After all this, that monster still isn't here.

19:08.870 --> 19:14.350
Now I'll have to find him and give 
him a talking to, no matter what!

19:16.360 --> 19:21.460
You want me to tell the Westelande nobles 
to restore normal relations with Eastal?

19:21.460 --> 19:25.120
Those Genius things caused the moths, right?

19:25.560 --> 19:27.430
This is no time for infighting.

19:27.430 --> 19:29.000
Does that mean

19:29.500 --> 19:32.420
you're telling me to work with 
Shiroe and the Round Table?

19:32.940 --> 19:34.610
Depending on the circumstances.

19:34.890 --> 19:36.830
With that traitor?

19:36.830 --> 19:38.230
No way.

19:38.670 --> 19:42.370
I'm not letting him go home, either!

19:42.700 --> 19:44.550
I'm ordering you, as well.

19:45.190 --> 19:47.470
Stop the war with Eastal.

19:47.810 --> 19:48.870
Huh?

19:48.870 --> 19:50.230
Ordering?

19:50.230 --> 19:52.380
You're ordering me?

19:52.950 --> 19:55.510
You're a filthy woman. A rat.

19:55.510 --> 19:57.380
You're just a puppet.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.160
And you're ordering me?!

20:00.950 --> 20:02.390
You...

20:02.660 --> 20:04.710
I'll remind you what happens

20:05.710 --> 20:07.840
when you get smart with me!

20:09.520 --> 20:10.940
Enough.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.510
I was the one to make the promise.

20:16.510 --> 20:20.220
You will not be the one to deal with Shiro.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.450
The Round Table will contact us.

20:24.900 --> 20:30.960
The villain in glasses is probably thinking 
about how to negotiate with us right now.

20:31.550 --> 20:35.530
Let's wait and look forward to seeing what he does.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.410
Okay, Indicus?

20:39.970 --> 20:43.390
I'm not like Kanami and Leonardo.

20:43.800 --> 20:47.110
I'm a mere supporting player, like Kazuhiko.

20:47.650 --> 20:49.190
But that doesn't mean

20:49.190 --> 20:52.280
I have the option of giving up 
on the last performance.

20:52.750 --> 20:56.530
I need to get stronger, 
so I can see the clear blue sky

20:57.070 --> 20:59.230
that comes after the storm...

21:00.090 --> 21:03.730
<b>Ruin Islands Jacksea

21:04.710 --> 21:07.990
Did that help Shiroe a little, I wonder?

21:08.340 --> 21:11.940
Little siblings, your big sister did her best!

21:18.160 --> 21:20.020
I'm hungry...

21:20.020 --> 21:21.780
Come to think of it, so am I.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.910
We haven't eaten anything since yesterday!

21:24.910 --> 21:26.650
I miss mayonnaise.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.740
When you're tired, you need red bean buns.

21:28.740 --> 21:31.000
Or we could have gelatin sometimes.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.770
Let's eat breakfast as soon as we get back, then.

21:34.770 --> 21:38.770
I'll give it all I've got and make you my best meal.

21:40.190 --> 21:43.030
Then we're having curry! Right, Chief?

21:48.790 --> 21:50.570
My lord? My lord?

21:51.580 --> 21:53.040
What is it, Akatsuki?

21:54.080 --> 21:56.980
Good work, for now.

22:00.460 --> 22:03.210
You, too, Akatsuki.

23:48.730 --> 23:50.860
Let's eat!

23:54.270 --> 23:55.870
Hey, where's the old man?

23:55.870 --> 23:58.330
Still fixing the communications equipment.

23:58.620 --> 24:01.260
And we're stuck looking after Regan?

24:01.260 --> 24:02.810
I want to take a bath.

24:02.810 --> 24:04.770
Well, it's fine.

24:04.770 --> 24:07.960
While we're here, let's practice a little.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.720
The old man's gone! He ran!

24:12.960 --> 24:15.380
There's still more mabo!

24:15.380 --> 24:18.450
No, my lord needs more curry.

24:18.450 --> 24:21.180
No, I'm full...

24:21.180 --> 24:22.730
It looks good.

24:23.770 --> 24:27.130
May I join you?

24:25.110 --> 24:29.940
<b>The End</b>
