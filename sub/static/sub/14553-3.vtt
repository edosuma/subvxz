00:57.256 --> 01:00.712
I was on an airplane and there
was a Hasidic Jewish man

01:00.972 --> 01:04.107
trying to put an
enormous bag under the seat.

01:04.175 --> 01:06.578
It doesn't matter that
he was Hasidic,

01:06.645 --> 01:10.249
but it's a detail.

01:10.316 --> 01:12.284
It's a detail.

01:12.352 --> 01:15.320
When you try to put enormous
bags under seats,

01:15.388 --> 01:18.356
folks notice
the kind of person you are.

01:18.424 --> 01:20.158
They make note.

01:20.226 --> 01:21.927
They say some
Chinese guy--

01:21.994 --> 01:25.263
whatever you are--
they're going to describe you.

01:25.331 --> 01:26.431
They're not just gonna say,

01:26.499 --> 01:29.900
"A man put a giant thing
under a seat."

01:29.968 --> 01:31.068
What kind of man?

01:31.136 --> 01:33.037
It's not important.

01:33.105 --> 01:35.207
Just a fellow.

01:35.274 --> 01:38.311
No, this guy trying to
shove this thing under the seat

01:38.378 --> 01:41.181
and no one can leave, 'cause
he's not gonna not do it.

01:41.249 --> 01:44.218
And the flight attendant
was a guy--

01:44.286 --> 01:46.032
and I'm not gonna say he was gay,

01:46.152 --> 01:49.191
'cause that's not important.

01:49.259 --> 01:51.227
It doesn't enter into the story.

01:51.295 --> 01:53.930
I'm gonna call
the Jewish guy a Jewish guy

01:53.998 --> 01:58.301
and I'm gonna call the gay guy
just some guy.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.903
How do you like that?

01:59.970 --> 02:02.005
Isn't that unfair?

02:02.072 --> 02:04.874
I'm not gonna identify him
as gay,

02:04.942 --> 02:08.144
'cause I don't
want to discredit them.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.778
Actually, he didn't do
anything wrong.

02:09.846 --> 02:11.547
So...

02:11.615 --> 02:15.885
Boy, what a disaster
this is right now.

02:15.953 --> 02:18.488
Um...

02:18.556 --> 02:20.257
Jewish guy trying to put
the thing under the seat

02:20.325 --> 02:23.094
and the guy's going,
<i>"Sir,</i> it's not gonna fit."

02:23.161 --> 02:24.862
It's-- He was only slightly gay,
like that.

02:24.930 --> 02:27.032
He wasn't like,
<i>"Sir, it's not gonna fit !</i>

02:27.100 --> 02:28.600
<i>Ahhh !"</i>

02:28.668 --> 02:33.840
No, he just said,
<i>"Sir,</i> it's not gonna fit."

02:33.907 --> 02:35.208
( with Jewish accent )
"It's going to fit,

02:35.276 --> 02:37.110
"I know it's going to fit.

02:37.178 --> 02:40.013
"It's going to fit,
I'm telling you.

02:40.081 --> 02:41.681
Moses..."

02:41.749 --> 02:43.283
( laughing )

02:59.436 --> 03:01.038
What are you doing?

03:01.105 --> 03:03.907
I'm moving this desk so I can
put something else there.

03:04.075 --> 03:05.977
No, Mama put that there.

03:06.045 --> 03:07.545
It's hers.

03:07.613 --> 03:08.747
You better ask her first.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.082
It's all right, baby.

03:12.719 --> 03:16.022
You better ask Mama,
she put that there.

03:16.090 --> 03:17.557
Baby, Mama doesn't
live here anymore.

03:17.624 --> 03:19.525
She lives at her place, okay?

03:19.593 --> 03:21.627
But she used to live here,

03:21.695 --> 03:24.430
and what if she came over
and you moved that?

03:24.498 --> 03:25.598
Hmm?

03:36.611 --> 03:38.979
You suck, man.

03:39.047 --> 03:40.714
You suck at comedy.

03:43.418 --> 03:44.819
There's a lot of cheap places
on the Upper West Side,

03:44.886 --> 03:46.320
but I'd have to--

03:46.388 --> 03:48.623
It's just so far
from the kids' school.

03:48.691 --> 03:51.031
Your mom ate my asshole
last night.

03:52.328 --> 03:53.529
It was good.

03:53.596 --> 03:55.397
Not great, but it was good.

03:57.401 --> 03:58.934
Wanna know why it wasn't great?

04:00.404 --> 04:01.738
( tapping )

04:01.806 --> 04:03.039
Do you want to know why
it wasn't great?

04:03.107 --> 04:04.341
Why?

04:04.408 --> 04:07.878
Because it was your mom
and she sucks.

04:07.946 --> 04:10.047
I could go to Midtown,

04:10.115 --> 04:11.382
take the subway to
school every day.

04:11.450 --> 04:12.450
I don't know, man.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.118
Oh, you know what?

04:14.185 --> 04:15.652
Can I pitch an idea to you?

04:15.720 --> 04:16.987
It's a project.
Yeah, sure.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.088
Okay.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.489
Okay, this is great.

04:19.557 --> 04:21.757
We start with your mom.

04:21.825 --> 04:25.128
We kind of lower her
into a bathtub,

04:25.195 --> 04:26.562
but the bathtub's
not filled with water,

04:26.630 --> 04:30.799
it's filled with diarrhea
from homeless people,

04:30.867 --> 04:34.570
and then we put this
thing on her head, um...

04:34.637 --> 04:35.804
What are those things?

04:35.872 --> 04:37.939
It's like a brick,
but bit's bigger and gray.

04:38.007 --> 04:39.040
A cinder block?

04:39.108 --> 04:40.408
A cinder block,
we put a cinder block,

04:40.476 --> 04:43.077
put it on top of her head
to kind of hold her down.

04:43.144 --> 04:44.845
Do you know anybody who
lives in the East Village?

04:44.913 --> 04:46.046
I'm not done, I'm not done.

04:46.114 --> 04:48.013
I'm sorry, man, I got to
go to an open house.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.209
Can you tell me about this later?

04:49.275 --> 04:50.716
Yeah, that was, like,
10% of the idea.

04:50.784 --> 04:51.984
I gotta go to an open house.

04:52.052 --> 04:53.152
I'll see you later.
All right, can you--

04:53.220 --> 04:53.987
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

04:54.054 --> 04:55.155
Yeah.

04:55.275 --> 04:56.755
There's a lot more to it,
I think you're gonna like it.

04:56.823 --> 04:57.924
Okay, cool, thanks.
Some twists and turns.

04:57.991 --> 04:59.258
I'll see you later.
Cool.

05:03.364 --> 05:05.132
This is a great place.

05:05.199 --> 05:07.633
There's lots of light,
really modern,

05:07.753 --> 05:09.903
plenty of space.

05:09.971 --> 05:12.184
None of those things
are true about this place.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.209
This one is available
first of the month.

05:41.169 --> 05:42.736
Okay, so I really
want to thank you

05:42.804 --> 05:44.571
for helping me look--
Thanks.

05:44.639 --> 05:46.774
Oh, well, you're so welcome.

05:46.842 --> 05:47.942
Well, I just never
had to find a place

05:48.010 --> 05:49.644
for me and my girls by myself.

05:49.711 --> 05:52.079
It's just easier with somebody to, y'know...
Totally.

05:52.146 --> 05:53.247
I don't care.

05:53.314 --> 05:54.815
Do what I told you.

05:54.882 --> 05:57.394
You take a-- you take
the stove from apartment 16-B

05:57.514 --> 05:58.986
and put it in 17-B.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.855
"B," like "Boratikashi."

06:00.922 --> 06:01.889
Okay?

06:01.957 --> 06:03.090
Yeah.

06:03.158 --> 06:04.792
You act like a man,
you do your job.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.427
Okay, bye.

06:06.495 --> 06:08.329
What can I do for you, buddy?

06:08.396 --> 06:10.278
Hi, there's an ad in the paper

06:10.398 --> 06:12.192
for a three-bedroom
for 2,500.

06:12.312 --> 06:13.567
We don't have that.

06:13.635 --> 06:14.568
What are you looking for?

06:14.636 --> 06:15.702
Was it rented or--

06:15.770 --> 06:16.970
I'm sorry, we don't have it.

06:17.038 --> 06:18.172
You want three-bedroom,
two-bedroom,

06:18.240 --> 06:19.173
what you looking for?

06:19.241 --> 06:20.307
Is this the right place?

06:20.375 --> 06:21.709
'Cause this was in
this morning's paper.

06:21.777 --> 06:23.544
That's a bait-and-switch.

06:23.612 --> 06:24.845
Yes, exactly.

06:24.913 --> 06:27.147
We have a nice apartment,
we put it in the ad

06:27.215 --> 06:28.983
and then you come here
and we show you something else.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.718
Hey, that's illegal, man.

06:30.785 --> 06:32.219
Okay, so call the police, man.

06:32.287 --> 06:33.320
What do you want from me?

06:33.388 --> 06:35.160
Hummus or an apartment, huh?

06:35.280 --> 06:36.423
You come here,

06:36.491 --> 06:39.468
nice couple like you,
you want a nice child nest?

06:39.588 --> 06:40.795
Make a child.
No, no, we're not--

06:40.863 --> 06:42.491
No, she's just my friend.

06:42.611 --> 06:43.631
She just came to help me.

06:43.699 --> 06:45.733
Go to building 701
down the block,

06:45.801 --> 06:47.910
to the left,
apartment 17-A.

06:48.030 --> 06:49.295
Okay?

06:49.589 --> 06:51.038
All right.
Yeah.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.974
There's people there now,
but they'll be out in a week.

06:54.042 --> 06:54.908
Okay.

06:57.578 --> 06:59.346
It's here.
Is that it?

06:59.414 --> 07:00.714
Give me the key.

07:06.252 --> 07:09.008
Did you just...
smell my head?

07:10.155 --> 07:13.141
Ahh, what you...
Oh, shit!

07:13.261 --> 07:14.359
What you do ?!

07:14.427 --> 07:15.560
Let's go, let's go.
Hi.

07:15.627 --> 07:16.628
Sorry--
Let's go.

07:16.695 --> 07:17.930
No, no, it's okay.
Get out!

07:17.997 --> 07:19.331
Get out of my house!

07:19.399 --> 07:20.366
Let's go, come on.
No, no.

07:20.434 --> 07:21.233
It's okay.

07:21.301 --> 07:22.335
Hi, hi.

07:22.402 --> 07:24.630
I'm Pamela and this is Louie,

07:24.750 --> 07:26.206
and Shai gave us the key.

07:26.273 --> 07:28.008
Right, but let's go,
come on, come on.

07:28.075 --> 07:29.543
We're just-- No, no, no, it's okay.
I'm sorry.

07:29.610 --> 07:31.512
Let's go, 'cause I don't want to live here.
No-- Why?

07:31.580 --> 07:33.495
You didn't even give it a chance.
There's a toilet in the kitchen.

07:33.615 --> 07:34.584
Oh, my...

07:34.704 --> 07:35.849
( laughing )

07:35.917 --> 07:37.618
It's a toilet!
Yeah.

07:37.686 --> 07:39.553
So let's go, come on.
So awesome.

07:39.621 --> 07:41.849
Let's get out of here.
No, no, don't write it off.

07:41.969 --> 07:44.320
You're just-- Come on,
look at the living room.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.569
I mean, there's windows
in there, it's so nice.

07:46.689 --> 07:47.719
Would you just look around?

07:47.839 --> 07:48.663
Come on.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.256
We're just gonna look around
the apartment

07:50.376 --> 07:51.499
for a second, okay?

07:51.566 --> 07:53.067
Do you want me to make you an egg?
Okay.

07:53.135 --> 07:54.402
Yeah?
Yes, okay.

07:54.436 --> 07:55.670
That's what I'm gonna...a.

07:55.737 --> 07:57.838
Okay.
Okay, all right.

07:57.906 --> 08:01.174
It's fine, I'll make you
nice, all right?

08:01.242 --> 08:03.444
Okay.
( speaking foreign language )

08:03.511 --> 08:05.125
Okay, we're done with the pickle.

08:05.245 --> 08:07.898
You don't need
any more pickled things.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.651
You're fine, everything's fine.

08:10.719 --> 08:12.920
We're gonna have some nice eggs

08:12.988 --> 08:14.989
and I'm gonna cook for you

08:15.057 --> 08:17.225
and it's all gonna be great.

08:19.628 --> 08:21.396
( footsteps approaching )

09:09.312 --> 09:10.613
There you go.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.815
You're gonna eat this egg,
you're gonna love it.

09:12.883 --> 09:14.950
The edges are crunchy and brown.

09:15.018 --> 09:16.218
Good for you.
( groaning )

09:16.286 --> 09:18.421
Hey, hey, hey, I don't
want to live here, so...

09:18.489 --> 09:20.189
Why?

09:20.257 --> 09:21.591
'Cause he's not done living here

09:21.658 --> 09:23.192
and there's a toilet
in the kitchen and--

09:23.260 --> 09:25.028
You...
So what?

09:25.095 --> 09:26.763
You not cook the right way.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.197
Yeah, he doesn't want the eggs.
What?

09:28.265 --> 09:29.432
Just let's go, come on.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.567
Oh, my God!

09:30.634 --> 09:32.502
With the two of you!

09:32.569 --> 09:34.870
You know what, Pateli?

09:34.938 --> 09:37.239
Your wife died
a year ago, so your turn is up

09:37.307 --> 09:39.541
in a statistical month.

09:39.609 --> 09:43.546
And you, you're so afraid of
life that you're boring.

09:43.614 --> 09:45.180
You know what?

09:45.248 --> 09:47.382
You know what?

09:47.450 --> 09:50.219
Thanks for the reminder, fellas.

09:50.286 --> 09:52.287
( bleep ) men.

09:52.355 --> 09:54.156
I'm outtie.

10:35.570 --> 10:36.503
Hello?

10:39.302 --> 10:43.134
This house was built in 1850
in the Federalist style,

10:43.254 --> 10:44.531
as I'm sure you noticed.

10:44.662 --> 10:47.130
This is the entrance foyer.

10:47.198 --> 10:48.932
It's one of the few houses
on the road

10:49.000 --> 10:51.332
to retain the
single-family layout.

10:53.670 --> 10:56.639
This is just as it was when it
was built and then lived in,

10:56.706 --> 10:58.540
first by a fabric merchant,

10:58.608 --> 11:01.110
and then later, by a daughter
of Theodore Roosevelt

11:01.177 --> 11:02.644
when he was police commissioner.

11:02.712 --> 11:04.246
Actually, she died here.

11:04.314 --> 11:08.317
It was only rented once to
a somewhat famous comedian,

11:08.384 --> 11:11.254
Lenny Bruce.

11:11.321 --> 11:14.290
This bathroom has a shower
that's also a steam room,

11:14.358 --> 11:17.446
a heated toilet seat
and a claw-foot bathtub.

11:19.911 --> 11:22.499
This could be
a bedroom for a child.

11:22.619 --> 11:24.502
How many bedrooms are there?
Five.

11:25.971 --> 11:28.840
So I could have my own room

11:28.908 --> 11:30.508
and the kids could
each have their own room.

11:30.576 --> 11:32.310
And you could have
a play room and an office.

11:36.148 --> 11:38.148
What did you say
you do for a living?

11:38.216 --> 11:39.587
I'm in show business.

11:42.955 --> 11:44.058
Okay.

11:46.891 --> 11:48.758
Here is the kitchen,
which, as you can see,

11:48.826 --> 11:52.128
is full-service-- very modern
and yet tasteful.

11:52.196 --> 11:54.631
And these beautiful glass doors

11:54.698 --> 11:57.483
lead to a gorgeous garden.

12:03.074 --> 12:05.175
This would be the ideal home

12:05.243 --> 12:07.611
for a single father
and his children.

12:07.679 --> 12:11.182
Your girls would be
very, very happy here,

12:11.250 --> 12:14.887
even happier than they are
at their mother's house.

12:14.954 --> 12:16.856
You would be their favorite

12:16.923 --> 12:18.824
and no one could judge you

12:18.892 --> 12:20.527
or say that you were anything

12:20.594 --> 12:23.063
but a wonderful,
wonderful father.

12:23.130 --> 12:27.100
Buying this house would
fix absolutely everything...

12:27.168 --> 12:28.602
everything...

12:28.669 --> 12:30.036
everything...

12:30.104 --> 12:31.538
everything...

12:31.605 --> 12:32.939
everything...

12:33.007 --> 12:34.307
everything...

12:34.375 --> 12:35.408
everything...

12:35.475 --> 12:36.876
everything...

12:36.943 --> 12:38.010
everything...

12:38.077 --> 12:39.244
everything...

12:39.312 --> 12:40.412
everything...

12:40.480 --> 12:42.172
everything...

12:42.292 --> 12:44.015
Yes, it would, yes, it would.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.683
Yes, it would!

12:45.751 --> 12:48.452
I'm sorry?

12:48.520 --> 12:50.889
Uh, how much is the house?

12:50.957 --> 12:52.824
The asking price is 17 million.

12:55.595 --> 12:56.940
I'll take it.

13:00.978 --> 13:01.978
Hey.
Hey.

13:02.046 --> 13:03.313
Louie.
How's it going?

13:03.380 --> 13:04.247
How are you, my man?
How are you?

13:04.315 --> 13:06.182
Good to see you, Ken.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.617
You don't stop up here too often.

13:07.685 --> 13:09.385
What's-- what's up?

13:09.453 --> 13:12.021
Just checking in.
Good.

13:12.089 --> 13:14.356
I got some theater gigs
this month coming up,

13:14.424 --> 13:16.325
so some good money rolling in.

13:16.393 --> 13:18.126
Great, great.
A lot of good money coming in.

13:18.194 --> 13:20.028
So what are you trying to buy?

13:20.096 --> 13:21.930
What do you mean?

13:21.997 --> 13:23.765
Whenever you tell me you
have good money coming in,

13:23.832 --> 13:25.032
it's because you want to
buy something.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.368
Yeah, I know.
So... what is it?

13:27.435 --> 13:28.603
Well, okay.

13:28.670 --> 13:30.071
My girls and I are--

13:30.138 --> 13:31.505
We're still living in
the same place

13:31.573 --> 13:32.973
as when I was married.
Right.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.165
And I just-- I think
we need a fresh start.

13:35.285 --> 13:36.076
Okay.

13:36.144 --> 13:37.105
So you want to move.

13:37.225 --> 13:40.131
Yeah, it's time and--
Good, good, good, good.

13:40.251 --> 13:42.082
So have you started looking?

13:42.150 --> 13:44.023
Well, so I found a place.
Great.

13:44.143 --> 13:45.786
To rent?

13:45.853 --> 13:47.387
It's to buy.
Louie.

13:47.455 --> 13:48.555
I know.

13:48.623 --> 13:49.957
Louie, we talked about this.

13:50.024 --> 13:51.491
You can't afford to buy
anything right now.

13:51.559 --> 13:53.095
You're still paying support.

13:53.215 --> 13:54.961
I know, I just--

13:55.029 --> 13:56.229
This place is perfect

13:56.297 --> 13:58.432
and I know my girls would be
really happy there.

13:58.499 --> 14:00.266
Look, I'm your accountant.

14:00.334 --> 14:02.168
I can only tell you
what you can afford

14:02.236 --> 14:04.960
and I think that you're gonna
have a very hard time

14:05.080 --> 14:07.507
finding credit right now.

14:07.575 --> 14:08.808
Dude.

14:10.210 --> 14:11.944
Okay.

14:12.012 --> 14:13.946
How much is it?

14:14.014 --> 14:15.881
Look, it's a lot,
but--

14:15.949 --> 14:17.383
How much?

14:17.450 --> 14:19.485
It's-- For what it is,
it's really cheap.

14:19.553 --> 14:21.053
Right.
Like, I couldn't believe--

14:21.121 --> 14:23.823
When the lady told me how much
it was, I was blown away...

14:23.891 --> 14:25.325
How much?
... by how little it is.

14:25.392 --> 14:27.427
But it is-- it's a lot, though,
I'll acknowledge that.

14:27.495 --> 14:28.895
I acknowledge--
Louie.

14:28.963 --> 14:29.929
How much?

14:29.997 --> 14:32.565
Okay, it's...

14:32.633 --> 14:35.035
... seven...

14:35.103 --> 14:37.604
... teen...

14:37.672 --> 14:39.606
million.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.407
$17 million.

14:42.448 --> 14:46.668
So... I know it's a lot.

14:47.848 --> 14:51.318
Um, Louie, do I really
need to say anything?

14:51.386 --> 14:52.787
I mean...

14:52.854 --> 14:55.090
Well, I had a good year,
you know, and I just--

14:55.157 --> 14:57.425
When do I get
to step up, you know?

14:57.493 --> 14:59.394
I just feel like--
come on, man.

14:59.462 --> 15:03.432
Do I-- do I really need to
explain to you

15:03.500 --> 15:06.802
why you can't buy
a $17 million house?

15:06.870 --> 15:08.571
I just thought if--
maybe if I really bear down

15:08.638 --> 15:09.939
and I don't spend, like,

15:10.007 --> 15:11.507
you know, I don't spent
a lot on other stuff.

15:11.575 --> 15:14.245
I could just change--
I think I could change--

15:14.365 --> 15:16.846
Let's-- let's take a look
at the numbers.

15:16.914 --> 15:19.048
Okay, totally, yes, yes.

15:19.116 --> 15:20.950
So that's 17 million.

15:21.017 --> 15:22.818
Mm-hmm.

15:22.886 --> 15:26.056
So you have to
put down 3.4 million.

15:26.124 --> 15:28.926
And you have to put that
down now, in cash.

15:28.993 --> 15:30.594
And then your monthly payments

15:30.662 --> 15:34.165
are gonna be 77,000,

15:34.233 --> 15:36.902
plus maintenance and tax.

15:36.970 --> 15:40.573
So basically, 80,000 a month,

15:40.641 --> 15:43.276
plus the 3.4 million that
you're gonna plunk down

15:43.343 --> 15:44.877
right now, okay?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.212
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.415
So now let's compare that
to your current assets.

15:49.483 --> 15:51.517
All right, currently,

15:51.585 --> 15:54.953
in savings, you have $7,000.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.693
7,000.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.094
Yeah.

16:06.793 --> 16:10.381
So, um... you have

16:11.236 --> 16:15.908
less than ten times less

16:15.976 --> 16:20.699
than one mortgage payment
on this house.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.784
Well, let me-- Okay.

16:23.852 --> 16:27.021
Louie, you're gonna have to...

16:27.089 --> 16:29.690
If-- if-- I--

16:29.758 --> 16:30.925
'Cause we haven't even--

16:30.993 --> 16:34.394
I mean, if I was able to
get them to come down.

16:34.462 --> 16:36.730
I'm just saying, what could
I afford right now?

16:36.797 --> 16:39.866
Like, what could I buy
a house for right now?

16:39.933 --> 16:40.967
Buy a house?

16:41.034 --> 16:42.902
Right now?
Yeah.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.171
Well...

16:45.238 --> 16:46.372
I mean, right now,

16:46.439 --> 16:49.375
you could buy a house
that costs $7,000.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.117
You know, you should
find a nice rental.

17:02.924 --> 17:04.224
I mean, isn't there...

17:06.895 --> 17:08.863
What about--
what about Obama?

17:12.234 --> 17:14.268
What-- what about it?

17:14.336 --> 17:16.971
I mean...
what do you mean?

17:17.039 --> 17:19.775
I have children, I have two kids,

17:19.842 --> 17:22.778
and I should totally be
saving for them

17:22.846 --> 17:25.948
and I'm totally not
saving for them at all.

17:26.016 --> 17:27.816
It's really bad

17:27.884 --> 17:31.586
how I'm not preparing
for their future

17:31.654 --> 17:34.589
or even their near-present.

17:34.657 --> 17:39.093
It's so irresponsible and unfair.

17:39.161 --> 17:41.128
I know it's wrong,
but part of me feels like,

17:41.196 --> 17:43.597
why should they get the money,
anyway?

17:43.665 --> 17:46.400
They didn't do the shows,
why should they get the money?

17:46.468 --> 17:49.404
Why should they get paid
for shit I did?

17:49.471 --> 17:51.906
It doesn't really
make sense to me.

17:51.974 --> 17:53.709
It doesn't make sense that
kids get your money

17:53.776 --> 17:54.910
after you're gone.

17:54.978 --> 17:56.412
It's like when
we used to let kings

17:56.479 --> 17:57.880
take over for their fathers.

17:57.948 --> 18:02.152
That's the craziest rule
that ever existed.

18:02.220 --> 18:06.357
That if the king dies,
they let his kid be the king.

18:06.425 --> 18:10.595
What are the odds that he's not
gonna be a piece of shit?

18:10.663 --> 18:12.397
How do you let that...

18:15.234 --> 18:17.001
That's one of the weirdest
things that we've ever done

18:17.069 --> 18:18.302
as a race of people.

18:18.370 --> 18:19.704
I mean all of us.

18:19.772 --> 18:20.839
White people and--

18:20.906 --> 18:22.774
I mean, there are
black kings, too.

18:22.842 --> 18:26.244
Of African countries.

18:26.311 --> 18:28.379
There's never been
a black king of England.

18:30.682 --> 18:33.017
That's never gonna happen.

18:33.085 --> 18:35.686
That is one color line
that's never gonna get--

18:35.754 --> 18:37.422
Don't even hope, man.

18:37.489 --> 18:38.856
It ain't gonna happen.

18:38.924 --> 18:42.694
There's not gonna be
a black king of England.

18:42.761 --> 18:44.462
I mean, after all that white

18:44.530 --> 18:46.664
that's been pumped into their
blood for years,

18:46.732 --> 18:49.534
they've just been this
kind of jizzy white color

18:49.602 --> 18:52.604
for all these generations.

18:52.671 --> 18:53.971
"Purpley"-- They're all--

18:54.039 --> 18:57.109
Every British royal
looks like cock meat.

18:57.176 --> 19:00.979
That's what their faces look
like, an Irish penis.

19:03.482 --> 19:04.815
That's what they look like--

19:04.883 --> 19:07.885
Someone took an Irishman's penis
and stretched it out

19:07.953 --> 19:11.789
and drew a face
on it with Sharpie.

19:11.857 --> 19:13.158
Just...

19:13.225 --> 19:14.158
That's what they look like.

19:23.368 --> 19:24.602
Hey.

19:24.669 --> 19:26.904
I didn't see you today.

19:26.971 --> 19:28.505
Yeah, I...

19:30.575 --> 19:32.842
Oh.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.210
I see.

19:36.846 --> 19:39.147
You know, I don't just
have these places.

19:39.215 --> 19:41.583
I could show you
some nice rentals.

19:41.651 --> 19:44.102
Small, but okay.

19:46.355 --> 19:48.190
No.

19:48.257 --> 19:49.791
No, I'm buying this house.

19:52.295 --> 19:53.829
I'm buying this house.
