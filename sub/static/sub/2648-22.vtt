19:00.751 --> 19:03.377
[ Coughing ] Okay, Cam.
No, you're right.

19:03.461 --> 19:06.923
You're right. I have no defense.
I am terrible.

19:07.005 --> 19:09.840
And the thing is I knew I was
terrible, and I was going anyway.

19:09.925 --> 19:11.926
I think maybe
I tried to justify it...

19:12.010 --> 19:13.886
by saying we're
two different people.

19:13.970 --> 19:17.514
And you're more of a caregiver,
and I have... other strengths.

19:17.597 --> 19:20.517
And that's what makes us such
a good couple, you know? But-

19:20.599 --> 19:23.936
No, no. It's a cop-out.
I've been very selfish,

19:24.019 --> 19:26.355
And I need to do better,
and I will.

19:42.785 --> 19:44.453
Ah. Wow.

19:45.704 --> 19:47.622
No place to go
but up, huh?

19:50.999 --> 19:52.377
Don't look at me like that.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.170
We all got problems.

19:55.254 --> 19:56.964
[Whimpers ]

19:57.047 --> 19:58.965
This ain't
gonna work, sweetie.

19:59.049 --> 20:01.301
That look ain't gonna work on me.
Come on.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.553
Come on. Let's go.

20:06.054 --> 20:09.057
I know it's old-fashioned,
but I like a strong man-

20:09.139 --> 20:11.684
a man that can say no
when I can't.

Oh.
Not a word.

20:25.404 --> 20:26.447
Oh, yes!

20:26.530 --> 20:28.406
But instead, I have Jay.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.075
I'm strong,

20:31.159 --> 20:33.160
but look at this face.

20:33.244 --> 20:34.245
Mmm!

20:34.327 --> 20:35.871
[ Gloria ] Maybe we
are the way we are...

20:35.997 --> 20:38.373
because of the people we're with.
Shh.

20:38.457 --> 20:41.083
Or maybe we just pick
the people we need.

20:41.167 --> 20:43.753
However it works,
when you find each other,

20:43.836 --> 20:45.336
you should never let go.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.755
Mmm, mmm, mmm!
Do you two need some time alone?

Yeah. You were out
for quite a while.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.770
What have you been up to?

21:04.854 --> 21:06.606
I've just been sitting here
watching you.

21:06.688 --> 21:10.066
Mmm. Well, I'm gonna
go to bed.

21:10.149 --> 21:12.318
Okay.

21:14.279 --> 21:15.779
Thanks for staying home
with me.

21:15.863 --> 21:17.905
Well, you know- in sickness
and in health. Right?

21:17.990 --> 21:20.075
You're still blinking, sweetie.
