CHRIS ROCK:
Before I was a student
at Tattaglia,

00:03.804 --> 00:06.740
I had no idea what to expect
from high school.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.278
I thought it might
be dangerous.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.416
I thought it might be exciting.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.784
* She's all right

00:16.817 --> 00:19.420
* She's all right

00:19.453 --> 00:23.524
* That's girl's all right
with me *

00:23.557 --> 00:27.095
* Yeah.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.329
Damn, I could've lost an eye.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.697
The classes that I thought

00:29.730 --> 00:31.465
would be excitingwere boring.

00:31.499 --> 00:35.303
Does anyone know what these are?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.371
Reason her husband cries?

00:37.405 --> 00:38.772
Beaver tails?

00:38.806 --> 00:41.709
And the boring classes
were even worse.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.077
This semester,

00:43.111 --> 00:44.478
we will explore
the great books

00:44.512 --> 00:46.080
of literature

00:46.114 --> 00:47.648
from the 20th Century,

00:47.681 --> 00:51.452
and you will write reports
on these books

00:51.485 --> 00:52.353
from the 20th Century.

00:52.386 --> 00:55.656
You will turn them
into me,

00:55.689 --> 00:57.725
and I will read them,

00:57.758 --> 01:00.128
and I will grade them.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.401
My English teacher was like
a sleeping pill in a skirt.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.383
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.171
After mere words failed
to bore us to death,

01:43.204 --> 01:45.406
Ms. Rivera unleashed
her next weapon:

01:45.439 --> 01:46.840
the boring assignment.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.343
The first book you're
gonna write a report on

01:49.377 --> 01:52.646
is Invisible Man
by Ralph Ellison.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.316
It is the story of a man

01:55.349 --> 01:58.452
who feels invisible
in modern society.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.854
She's putting me to sleep,
and I'm in the future.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.423
It's very exciting,

02:02.456 --> 02:05.459
and some people find it
stimulating

02:05.493 --> 02:07.561
and inspiring.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.229
How long do we have?

02:08.262 --> 02:09.597
Until we finish the book,

02:09.630 --> 02:11.465
or until the book finishes us!

02:11.499 --> 02:13.634
It's due at the end of the week.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.770
This is great--
Invisible Man.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.372
It's about time
we pay homage

02:18.406 --> 02:19.173
to the revolutionaries.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.409
Are you crazy?
We have five days

02:21.442 --> 02:22.876
to read this book
and write a report.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.878
I can't even get through the
title without falling asleep.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.547
Dude, you're looking
at this all wrong.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.648
That's what I said to Greg

02:27.681 --> 02:29.617
when he saw his first
Playboy centerfold.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.519
No, I'm looking at this
like I'll never get it done.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.553
How are you looking at it?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.854
Look at it like you're about

02:33.887 --> 02:36.624
to make the best friend a guy
can have: a book.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.193
Greg felt that way
until this happened.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.528
What's it gonna
be, Greg?

02:40.561 --> 02:42.330
Me or Lord of
the Rings?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.666
Sorry, man.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.673
Through the work
of those great authors,

02:52.706 --> 02:54.508
you can transport yourself
back to a time

02:54.542 --> 02:55.709
when things were simpler.

02:55.743 --> 02:56.944
I wish I could be transported

02:56.977 --> 02:58.579
to a time
when I was actually awake.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.248
So what are you gonna do?

03:00.281 --> 03:02.316
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find a way

03:02.350 --> 03:03.617
to bring excitement
to The Invisible Man.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.853
Why don't you find him
an invisible woman?

03:07.255 --> 03:08.889
While I struggled
with my English class,

03:08.922 --> 03:11.759
my father struggled
with home economics.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.927
I think we need
to raise Mr. Omar's rent.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.929
Ooh, he's not going
to like that.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.998
You know how Mr. Omar is.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.767
I don't care how he is.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.903
You think I can tell that
to the phone company?

03:22.936 --> 03:26.240
"I-I'd love to pay,
but you know how I am."

03:26.274 --> 03:28.576
All I'm saying is,
he's a good tenant.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.777
I don't want to lose him.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.778
If we lose the house,

03:30.811 --> 03:33.747
we don't have to worry
about losing a tenant.

03:33.781 --> 03:37.285
I know that, but maybe we can
look at some other areas.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.786
What other areas, Rochelle?

03:38.819 --> 03:41.522
What? You want me
to knock over a bank?

03:41.555 --> 03:42.523
Now you're thinking.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.593
Get Peaches and Malvo,
and rob a liquor store?

03:45.626 --> 03:47.628
Look. I made up my mind.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.497
I'm raising Mr. Omar's rent.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.682
Well?

04:08.716 --> 04:10.551
It's done.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.986
What the hell?

04:13.020 --> 04:14.888
What does it say?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.056
It's from Mr. Omar.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.759
It says, "Open the door."

04:18.792 --> 04:21.061
Evening, Mr. Julius,
Ms. Rochelle.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.363
Hi, Mr. Omar.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.331
Who's this?

04:23.364 --> 04:24.332
I'm Mr. Randall.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.333
He's the
building inspector.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.400
Building inspector?

04:26.434 --> 04:27.535
After a careful inspection
of Mr. Omar's apartment,

04:27.568 --> 04:29.770
I've found the
following violations.
Violations?

04:29.803 --> 04:31.572
And, to justify
any rent increase,

04:31.605 --> 04:33.607
you'll have to bring
the cited items up to code.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.409
Uh-huh. 'Cause I don't mind
paying more rent,

04:35.443 --> 04:37.545
but everything
gotta be right.
You know how I am.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.814
"You will have to
provide alternate accommodations

04:40.848 --> 04:42.683
until said apartment
is brought up to code."

04:42.716 --> 04:43.784
What does that mean?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.586
That means you have to find him
a new place to stay.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.388
What?
Call me

04:47.421 --> 04:49.357
for an approval inspection
after the work is done.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.758
And get your CO2 levels checked.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.060
Get them checked.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.434
We can't do all this,
and put up Mr. Omar, too.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.602
You should have
thought about that

05:01.635 --> 05:03.804
before you took
that note upstairs.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.340
Well, we could do most
of the work ourselves,

05:06.374 --> 05:09.643
and we could let
him stay here, and we
could cut down costs.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.711
Stay here?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.480
You got a better idea?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.415
Yeah. Don't raise
Mr. Omar's rent.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.583
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.751
You didn't
like that idea.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.957
While my father read
his code violations,

05:23.991 --> 05:25.926
I decided
to skip reading altogether.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.929
All right. The Invisible Dog,
The Invisible Mice, Shaft--

05:28.962 --> 05:31.098
Ohh! How did that
get in there?

05:31.131 --> 05:32.766
All right.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.901
One Nation Invisible,

05:33.934 --> 05:35.669
Now You See 'Em,
Now You Don't,
Peek-a-boo--

05:35.703 --> 05:38.138
That's cute. That's for kids.
Hard To See...

05:38.171 --> 05:41.108
Ah! The Invisible Man.
Here you go.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.777
So what made you
think of this anyway, Chris?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.813
Well, I remembered that Jaws
was a book before a movie,

05:45.846 --> 05:48.449
so I figured they made a movie
out of The Invisible Man.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.984
I wish they'd start
making movies into books.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.753
Popcorn getting expensive.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.057
Right. Um, you guys mind
if I watch this in here?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.159
Yeah.
Yeah. Go
right ahead, man.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.160
So who's in it anyway?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.729
Probably Sidney Poitier.

06:01.762 --> 06:05.733
Or Jim Brown... My man!

06:05.766 --> 06:08.636
Jim Brown was actually the
second choice to Sydney Poitier

06:08.669 --> 06:10.471
for the lead in many roles,

06:10.504 --> 06:12.172
including
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.007
After watching
The Invisible Man,

06:14.041 --> 06:15.943
I managed to do
in a few hours

06:15.976 --> 06:18.078
what it was taking Greg
a few days to do.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.848
So, how do you like
the book so far?
Oh, it was great.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.149
I already
turned in my report.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.751
Already turned it in?

06:23.784 --> 06:25.586
I'm only, like, halfway
through the book.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.721
I've never seen you crank out
a book report this fast.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.789
I didn't read the book.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.458
I watched the movie.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.660
What movie?

06:32.693 --> 06:34.194
The Invisible Man.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.531
You know, the guy drinks
the serum, disappears.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.833
Dude, the movie
The Invisible Man

06:39.867 --> 06:43.671
has absolutely nothing
to do with the book
Invisible Man.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.739
I don't know
what you wrote,
but whatever it is,

06:45.773 --> 06:48.008
you better hope
Ms. Rivera doesn't read it.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.911
Too bad I didn't write
that paper in invisible ink!

06:59.019 --> 07:00.988
While I was trying
not to fail English,

07:01.021 --> 07:03.557
my parents were trying
not to fail inspection.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.758
I said it.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.660
I said, look
in some other areas,

07:06.694 --> 07:09.229
maybe trim a little
here or there, but no!

07:09.262 --> 07:11.599
No. Ole Truck Turner
here had a better idea.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.600
Rochelle...

07:12.633 --> 07:13.634
It just burns me up

07:13.667 --> 07:15.135
to think that
we're up here working,

07:15.168 --> 07:18.138
while he's downstairs
in our house, chilling.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.207
Oh, he's not that bad.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.043
Not bad? Julius, in
one night he managed to...

07:23.076 --> 07:25.646
...drink all the Kool-Aid...

07:25.679 --> 07:28.782
...file his toenails
on my table...

07:28.816 --> 07:31.519
...and keep me up half
the night playing records.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.187
(Marvin Gaye's
"Gotta Give It Up" plays)

07:34.221 --> 07:36.757
Okay, maybe he is
a little nuisance.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.792
Yeah, like cancer.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.794
Rochelle, it's not like

07:40.828 --> 07:42.796
you didn't have anything
to do with it.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.065
Every time I turn around,
you're quitting another job.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.834
Since when?

07:46.867 --> 07:47.668
Since whenever.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.936
I'm just saying,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.938
I hope you like
being at the beauty salon,

07:50.971 --> 07:53.006
because if you find a job
you really like,

07:53.040 --> 07:55.776
maybe I wouldn't
have to keep two jobs.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.647
Oh! Oh, oh, wait a minute. So
you're saying that you think I

07:59.680 --> 08:02.750
use the fact that you have two
jobs as a reason to quit a job?

08:02.783 --> 08:05.085
I didn't say that.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.654
But she did.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.756
I do not need this.
My man has two jobs.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.159
I don't need this, man!
My man has two jobs!

08:12.192 --> 08:14.728
I do not need this, okay?

08:14.762 --> 08:16.597
My man has two jobs!

08:16.630 --> 08:19.232
Look. Let's just
get this finished.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.669
Fine.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.737
Trying to blame
all this on me.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.673
... people to drop over.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.207
Don't worry, dear.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.743
Everything will turn out
just fine.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.814
Is that all you watch?
The Munsters?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.816
He watches
The Addams Family, too.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.150
Hey, what's not to love?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.552
Lily? Now, that's a woman.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.754
Shame her husband's
already dead.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.823
Can we watch
something else?
I'm bored.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.625
Why don't you play
a game? Play cards.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.294
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Let's play blackjack.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.863
What you know
about blackjack?

08:49.897 --> 08:51.231
All you have to do is get 21.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.834
Well, you know what makes
that game really good?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.969
What?
Wagering.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.671
Cool. You want to play?

08:57.705 --> 08:58.839
Yeah.
Can I deal?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.340
Yeah.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.911
Oh, hell, yeah.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.979
After searching every class,

09:06.013 --> 09:08.849
I figured Ms. Rivera
could only be in one place--

09:08.882 --> 09:10.651
the teachers' lounge.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.321
Teachers may have
been boring in class,

09:14.354 --> 09:17.991
but the teachers' lounge
was a whole other thing.

09:18.025 --> 09:21.328
Kids. I hate these kids.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.865
These damn kids.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.800
Who needs them?

09:26.834 --> 09:29.336
I guess I do.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.371
Damn...

09:31.404 --> 09:32.372
kids.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.373
Chris,

09:33.406 --> 09:34.908
what are you doing here?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.910
I'm looking for Ms. Rivera.
I need to talk to her.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.246
This is the teacher's lounge.
It's not for students.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.248
Now, Ms. Morello!
Oh! I'm up next!

09:48.255 --> 09:51.191
Uh, Ms. Rivera.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.393
I need to talk to you.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.928
Chris.

09:54.962 --> 09:55.929
Whoo!

09:55.963 --> 09:57.164
I need to talk to you, too.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.166
I need my book
report back.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.267
I need to change
some things.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.136
A little late for that.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.271
Wait, this says "I."

10:04.304 --> 10:05.939
That's because you didn't do

10:05.973 --> 10:07.240
the assignment
that I gave you.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.709
You do realize

10:08.742 --> 10:11.244
that the movie
TheInvisible Man

10:11.278 --> 10:14.682
has absolutely nothing to do
with the book Invisible Man.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.785
Yeah, I know that now, but
why didn't you fail me?

10:17.818 --> 10:20.988
Your take on the movie
was insightful.

10:21.021 --> 10:21.922
You captured the fun

10:21.955 --> 10:25.125
and all the underlying
allegorical parallels.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.927
I did?
I did?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.930
We should go in the hallway.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.399
Yeah, before I get
a contact high.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.102
Chris, you're a good writer.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.237
That's why I gave you
an incomplete.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.707
You're going to have
to read the book, though.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.975
Why didn't you just do
what I told you to do?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.176
'Cause, if we're writing
about the same story,

10:43.210 --> 10:44.144
what difference
does it make

10:44.177 --> 10:46.680
whether I saw the movie
or read the book?

10:46.714 --> 10:47.915
Hey, I like movies, too.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.417
In fact, one of my favorites
is, uh, Rocky.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.919
I love Rocky.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.854
"I'll wait for you here."

10:53.887 --> 10:55.723
"How about I wait here
and you fight, huh?"

10:55.756 --> 10:59.092
Do you remember
"They call me Mr. Tibbs"?

10:59.126 --> 11:00.327
In The Heat
of The Night.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.862
"What's your prediction
for the fight?"

11:01.895 --> 11:03.030
"Pain."

11:03.063 --> 11:04.264
Rocky III.
Rocky III.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.233
See, if you love
movies so much,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.268
why can't we just
write papers on those?

11:08.301 --> 11:09.870
I'd get an "A" every time.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.972
That's a good idea, Chris,

11:12.005 --> 11:16.744
but I've been given a curriculum
and I cannot deviate from that.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.011
Well, the curriculum
isn't working.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.246
Half the class is asleep.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.482
That was the year Congress
passed No Child Left Awake.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.418
I... don't like to make waves.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.487
Besides, it wouldn't make
any difference.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.423
"I find your lack of
faith disturbing."

11:30.457 --> 11:32.159
Darth Vader.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.062
I'm gonna go
work on my paper.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.930
Chris.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.265
Yeah?

11:40.067 --> 11:40.934
Let's do it.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.837
Years later,
those very same words

11:43.871 --> 11:46.239
would send Mary Kay Letourneau
to jail.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.375
21.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.210
You hit on 17?

11:50.243 --> 11:53.213
What Mr. Omar didn't know was
that when it came to numbers,

11:53.246 --> 11:55.115
Drew was like my father.

11:55.148 --> 11:59.252
Wow, that's 562,002
granules of sugar.

12:01.021 --> 12:04.457
Wow, that's 357,000 raindrops.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.828
Wow, that's one cupcake!

12:11.932 --> 12:13.767
Two jacks!

12:13.801 --> 12:15.035
I got 20.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.338
I've got five. Hit me.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.340
That's eight.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.408
Hit me.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.111
That's ten.
Hit me.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.179
That's fifteen.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.180
Hit me.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.148
19

12:28.181 --> 12:29.316
Hit me.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.119
Are there any face cards
in the deck?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.887
You'll see.
That's 20.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.188
Hit me.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.024
Another ace?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.959
21!

12:38.992 --> 12:41.228
Tragic. Tragic!
Yes!

12:42.963 --> 12:46.066
Mr. Omar would like to hit him
one more time.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.801
Smell good?

12:49.837 --> 12:51.538
Back in my class,

12:51.571 --> 12:55.042
things were getting a little
more exciting than I expected.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.145
This was a great idea, Chris.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.179
Thanks.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.915
What is going on here?

13:03.516 --> 13:04.717
Ms. Morello,

13:04.751 --> 13:09.289
instead of writing reports
about books like we usually do,

13:09.322 --> 13:12.392
I thought I would switch
it up by watching

13:12.425 --> 13:15.996
movies based on books,
and write about those.

13:16.029 --> 13:19.466
Ms. Rivera, I don't know what
they do in Puerto Rico,

13:19.499 --> 13:20.901
but changing curriculum

13:20.934 --> 13:22.269
is unacceptable.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.038
I hope you realize
this is a very serious offense.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.406
You could lose your job.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.407
¿Comprende?

13:27.440 --> 13:30.310
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

13:30.343 --> 13:34.181
Dios mio! Where would you get
such a ridiculous idea?

13:34.214 --> 13:36.183
I didn't think Ms. Rivera had
heat vision,

13:36.216 --> 13:39.019
but I turned away to protect
my eyes just in case.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.858
Ms. Rivera took my idea
to watch movies in class

13:44.892 --> 13:46.393
and ended up getting the book
thrown at her.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.261
I hope she doesn't get
into too much trouble.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.196
I like Ms. Rivera.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.164
You know, I knew this
was gonna happen.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.199
This is why I'm
a conformist.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.001
I don't see what
the big deal is.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.603
The idea is for us to learn.
Who cares how we do it?

13:56.636 --> 14:00.507
There he is. He's the one
that inspired it all.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.441
Inspired all of what?

14:01.474 --> 14:04.111
Well, when I spoke
to the superintendent

14:04.144 --> 14:05.545
about what was going on
in class,

14:05.578 --> 14:08.215
I thought we would fire
Ms. Rivera immediately

14:08.248 --> 14:10.150
and have her deported,

14:10.183 --> 14:13.987
but it turns out she's
an American citizen!

14:14.021 --> 14:17.090
I love what you've been doing
and I really wanted to meet you.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.527
Chris, she told us
this was your idea.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.462
Yeah, it kinda was.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.297
Good job, young man.

14:24.331 --> 14:28.201
I'm sure that your parents
are very proud.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.438
Why don't we get one
with all of us?

14:31.471 --> 14:36.409
Most black men can't
make their inability
to read work for them.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.412
Tell that to 50 Cent.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.680
Ms. Rivera,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.082
you need to get
in on this.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.052
Oh, no, really.
I'm not very photogenic.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.254
No, no, no, I insist.
Right this way.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.323
There we are.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.259
Back home, the inspector
was making a list

14:52.292 --> 14:53.660
and checking it once.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.428
This was an inspection,
not Christmas.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.064
Everything's up to code.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.166
So can you just sign off
on this now?

14:59.199 --> 15:02.135
Well, everything looks good
except for one thing.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.170
What?
What?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.172
This box,

15:05.205 --> 15:07.607
it's one of the pre-1950
fuse boxes still in service.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.309
City code requires that

15:09.342 --> 15:11.311
be replaced by a code
circuit-breaker panel.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.445
We can't afford that.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.214
Well, until that fuse box
is replaced,

15:14.247 --> 15:16.449
this apartment's
uninhabitable.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.485
You mean I can't move
back into my place?

15:18.518 --> 15:20.153
I got widows to see.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.322
Well, unless you want them
to die in an electrical fire,

15:22.355 --> 15:23.957
that box has got to go.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.727
So how long is this
gonna take, man?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.529
I'm sorry,
but I don't have the money.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.663
There's nothing I can do.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.566
I guess you just
have to stay with us
until I get it.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.273
Ms. Rivera, you left so fast,
we didn't get a chance

15:40.307 --> 15:41.474
to talk about today.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.043
Isn't it great?
They're gonna put

15:43.076 --> 15:44.077
our picture in
the newspaper.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.145
I heard.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.147
You don't seem happy about it.

15:47.180 --> 15:51.384
Well, I just...
I don't feel so well.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.553
Oh. Well, what's all this?

15:53.586 --> 15:58.458
Just... cleaning out
the classroom.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.726
Oh.

15:59.759 --> 16:03.496
Well, I guess I'll see you
tomorrow.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.332
Chris...

16:05.365 --> 16:06.533
Yeah?

16:06.566 --> 16:10.237
"You still here?

16:10.270 --> 16:13.706
It's over. Go home. Go."

16:13.740 --> 16:15.508
Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

16:15.542 --> 16:25.018
* When your love is gone away,
it's a long good-bye *

16:27.154 --> 16:29.722
Back at home, Mr. Omar was
trying to get himself out

16:29.756 --> 16:31.424
of what he got himself into.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.693
What are you doing here? I
thought you went back upstairs.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.064
Drew, I was wondering if you
could make me a little loan.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.665
For what?

16:38.698 --> 16:41.601
Well, it seems the only thing
standing between me

16:41.634 --> 16:44.471
getting back in my apartment
is a new circuit-breaker panel,

16:44.504 --> 16:49.142
but it costs $300 and neither me
nor your father have the money.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.378
True. I can loan you the money.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.080
Turn around.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.416
Thank goodness! I really
appreciate this, Drew.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.719
And it'll only cost you
12 easy payments
of $30 a month.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.391
But that's $360.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.692
I know.

17:05.725 --> 17:09.362
Drew went on to make a fortune
selling sub-prime mortgages.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.298
Please. Thank you.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.103
Today we'll be reading
Shakespeare's Othello.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.606
It is the exciting story
of black rage.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.774
Where's Ms. Rivera?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.343
She didn't show up today.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.378
There he is!

17:25.412 --> 17:27.714
Agent Barnes, FBI.
We need to talk to you.

17:27.747 --> 17:31.618
Are they mistaking me
for Marion Barry?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.255
What's all this?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.390
Oh, I bought the
breaker panel myself,

17:37.424 --> 17:39.392
so it's not gonna
cost you a penny.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.461
That was music
to my father's ears.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.197
Looks good.
You can move back in.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.832
Oh, however,

17:45.865 --> 17:47.800
I'm gonna take the cost
of the panel

17:47.834 --> 17:49.502
and deduct it from my rent.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.339
Fine. That's fine, right?

17:52.372 --> 17:55.475
(cash register clacking
and dinging)

17:55.508 --> 17:58.111
That means your rent'll be
exactly what it is now.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.412
I know.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.783
Look, last time I saw
Ms. Rivera,

18:03.816 --> 18:05.418
she was loading things
into her car.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.354
She didn't tell me
where she was going.

18:07.387 --> 18:10.523
Name's not "Ms. Rivera."
It's Karen Rodriguez.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.193
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

18:13.226 --> 18:17.330
No, I didn't.
What'd she do, anyway?

18:17.364 --> 18:19.199
Did she sneak
across the border?

18:19.232 --> 18:20.433
The Puerto Rican border?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.335
She embezzled a quarter
of a million dollars

18:22.369 --> 18:24.604
from the teachers' pension plan
in Moab, Utah.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.273
I'm not sure
what's more shocking:

18:26.306 --> 18:28.341
the fact that a teachers'
pension plan had

18:28.375 --> 18:29.342
a quarter of a million dollars

18:29.376 --> 18:32.111
or that there was
a Puerto Rican in Utah.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.686
Chris.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.721
That's how she hid herself
in Utah.

18:41.754 --> 18:42.789
Ms. Rivera?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.524
She dressed like a Mormon.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.760
It's Perez now. I wanted
to say good-bye.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.497
FBI agents were looking for you
all over the school.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.532
You didn't say anything,
did you?

18:52.565 --> 18:53.800
No.

18:53.833 --> 18:58.571
Good. They've been chasing me
for eight years.

18:58.605 --> 19:02.209
Is it true what they say
about you being a fugitive

19:02.242 --> 19:03.543
and stealing all that money?

19:03.576 --> 19:06.679
I didn't buy this car
with trading stamps.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.781
If you could, my father
would have one.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.684
If it wasn't for that article,
they would have never found me.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.721
Oh, well, I'm sorry
for blowing your cover.

19:14.754 --> 19:18.225
I had forgotten how exciting
life could be,

19:18.258 --> 19:19.892
and you reminded me of that.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.561
Thanks, Chris.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.396
You're welcome.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.597
So where you going now?

19:24.631 --> 19:27.600
I thought I'd go
to Hollywood.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.237
I'll fit right in.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.440
See you in the movies, kid.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.610
Well, once again,
I learned a lesson.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.512
I learned that movies can
teach you

19:39.546 --> 19:41.214
almost as much as books can,

19:41.248 --> 19:44.984
but in the process, I lost the
best teacher I ever had.

19:45.017 --> 19:49.956
WOMAN:
Today we will be reading
about the wonders of air.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.991
Are there any questions?

19:52.024 --> 19:54.727
I didn't think so. Let's begin.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.700
What was that for?

20:00.733 --> 20:03.803
For making a boring class
exciting, then boring again.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.638
Thanks for nothing, Clubber.

20:08.808 --> 20:13.980
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.265
* Ah, make it funky now
