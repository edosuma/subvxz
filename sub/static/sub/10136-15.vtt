I couldn't get in there

08:01.856 --> 08:04.985
and I was 14.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.737
And it looks like Nicky and Alex

08:07.779 --> 08:08.822
aren't going to get

08:07.779 --> 08:08.822
in here, either.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.740
I mean, look at these questions.

08:10.782 --> 08:14.328
"Evaluate the scope

08:10.782 --> 08:14.328
of your child's verbal skills."

08:14.369 --> 08:16.496
Yeah, they have good

08:14.369 --> 08:16.496
verbal skills.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.873
I mean, you know,

08:16.537 --> 08:18.873
they do talk all the time..

08:18.915 --> 08:22.002
[baby talk]

08:23.253 --> 08:25.797
It's just not always

08:23.253 --> 08:25.797
in English.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.591
Perfect. Put down that

08:25.839 --> 08:28.591
they're bilingual.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.427
They're not bilingual.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.846
Sure they are.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.846
They speak two languages.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.515
English and gibberish.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.684
I'm not going to lie

08:35.556 --> 08:37.684
on this application.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.187
You want them to have

08:37.725 --> 08:40.187
a good education, don't you?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.521
Of course I do, Joey.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.023
The most important thing

08:41.562 --> 08:43.023
in the whole world

08:43.064 --> 08:44.607
right now is their education.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.151
I mean, you know,

08:44.649 --> 08:46.151
if my parents would've put me

08:46.193 --> 08:48.153
on the right track maybe

08:46.193 --> 08:48.153
I wouldn't be at night school

08:48.195 --> 08:50.113
right now getting my

08:48.195 --> 08:50.113
high school diploma.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.450
Well, then you gotta give

08:50.155 --> 08:53.450
the boys a little edge.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.660
- Really?

08:53.492 --> 08:55.660
- Yeah.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.538
You know something?

08:56.703 --> 08:58.538
You're right.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.040
- I'm their father.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.040
- Damn right.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.416
If I don't lie for 'em,

09:00.081 --> 09:01.416
who will?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.668
- That's right.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.668
- Alright, let's see.

09:03.710 --> 09:07.088
Language, bilingual.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.298
No. Wait, wait, wait..

09:08.340 --> 09:10.384
(both)

09:08.340 --> 09:10.384
Trilingual.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.801
Hold it, hold it, hold it..

09:11.843 --> 09:16.181
(both)

09:11.843 --> 09:16.181
Unbelievably-lingual.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.395
Steve, are you my friend?

09:21.436 --> 09:22.770
Yeah, of course I am.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.649
Watch it, Steve,

09:22.812 --> 09:26.649
she's setting you up.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.652
Do you mind, I'm talking

09:26.691 --> 09:29.652
to my friend.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.864
Can you help me with my math?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.657
Well, you know math

09:32.906 --> 09:34.657
is not my best subject

09:34.699 --> 09:36.743
but, hey,

09:34.699 --> 09:36.743
I'll give it a shot.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.620
Just need to know

09:36.784 --> 09:39.620
what's five take away one?

09:39.662 --> 09:42.040
Well, five take away one.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.460
Alright, now, let's say

09:42.082 --> 09:45.460
you have five cookies.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.588
Alright, now,

09:45.502 --> 09:48.588
if you take away one

09:48.629 --> 09:50.298
how many do you have left?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.259
Four, if I hurry.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.469
That's my..That's my cookie.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.469
Wait.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.346
Michelle, what are you doing?

09:56.388 --> 09:58.265
Studying.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.561
Hey, how'd the road test go?

10:02.602 --> 10:06.106
Terrible. She's the best driver

10:02.602 --> 10:06.106
I've ever been with.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.775
Even her maps

10:06.147 --> 10:08.775
were folded correctly.

10:08.816 --> 10:12.153
What did I tell you, dad?

10:08.816 --> 10:12.153
Kimmy was born to drive.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.281
I knew there was a reason.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.619
Alright. I don't know what

10:16.116 --> 10:19.619
to say. You're a natural, Kimmy.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.413
I just, I actually feel secure

10:21.455 --> 10:22.747
with you kids

10:21.455 --> 10:22.747
in the car with her.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.916
Tomorrow, you can all

10:22.789 --> 10:24.916
take a ride

10:24.958 --> 10:26.918
in The Wild Thing.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.253
Great, let's hit the mall.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.379
Let's hit Binge Burger.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.590
Let's hit Vegas.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.842
I feel lucky.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.597
[instrumental music]

10:38.638 --> 10:41.933
Jess! Jess!

10:38.638 --> 10:41.933
You'll never guess what.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.351
Bouton Hall just called.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.978
You must have done

10:43.393 --> 10:44.978
a great job on that application.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.438
They're interested

10:45.019 --> 10:46.438
in Nicky and Alex.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.981
I knew it. We're in.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.274
- Alright!

10:48.022 --> 10:49.274
- No, honey, we're not in yet.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.525
We have to take

10:49.316 --> 10:50.525
the boys down there

10:50.567 --> 10:52.193
this afternoon

10:50.567 --> 10:52.193
for an interview.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.654
They want to meet them and

10:52.235 --> 10:54.654
evaluate their abilities.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.701
Evaluate their little

10:58.741 --> 11:00.701
abilities, huh?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.997
[chuckling]

11:00.743 --> 11:03.997
Yeah. Isn't this exciting?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.997
I'm gonna go give 'em a bath.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.874
Somehow they look smarter

11:04.038 --> 11:06.874
when they're clean.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.089
Well, look at the time.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.175
I'll bet there's a hockey game

11:13.131 --> 11:15.175
on somewhere in the world.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.177
Get back here.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.346
Joey, what am I gonna do? I lied

11:17.218 --> 11:19.346
through my teeth on that thing.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.806
I-I said they were

11:19.387 --> 11:21.806
two little geniuses.

11:21.848 --> 11:25.852
Oh, boy. You better hope Becky

11:21.848 --> 11:25.852
gets those kids really clean.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.771
We're dead.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.693
[instrumental music]

11:36.571 --> 11:37.864
Alright. Bouton Hall.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.073
[baby talk]

11:39.115 --> 11:41.242
Look at this, guys.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.912
The starting line

11:41.284 --> 11:44.912
of the fast track.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.540
Right, fast track.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.208
Just let me do the talking.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.834
Oh, boy,

11:48.249 --> 11:49.834
I hope they like us.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.503
Oh, honey, they'll like us.

11:51.545 --> 11:55.006
Listen, sweetheart,

11:51.545 --> 11:55.006
if you happen to hear some..

11:55.048 --> 11:57.217
...I don't know, some strange

11:55.048 --> 11:57.217
things during this interview

11:57.258 --> 11:58.468
just, uh, just kinda go with it.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.137
Your hair looks good

11:58.510 --> 12:01.137
like that, by the way.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.805
What strange things?

12:02.847 --> 12:06.226
Well, uh, see, on the

12:02.847 --> 12:06.226
application, I may have, uh..

12:06.267 --> 12:07.352
What's the word I'm lookin'..

12:07.394 --> 12:09.812
I may have embellished

12:07.394 --> 12:09.812
a little bit.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.856
Embellished? How much?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.693
A little, tad, lil'

12:11.898 --> 12:14.693
minuscule amounts, really.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.236
Just a tad.

12:16.277 --> 12:20.781
Oh, Ambassador

12:16.277 --> 12:20.781
and Mrs. Katsopolis.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.076
I'm Mrs. Jacobs.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.076
Why don't you just sit down.

12:23.117 --> 12:27.205
Make yourselves at home and

12:23.117 --> 12:27.205
I'll be back with you shortly.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.253
Ambassador?

12:36.673 --> 12:38.799
Let's observe them through

12:36.673 --> 12:38.799
the two-way mirror for a while

12:38.841 --> 12:41.219
to see how they relate

12:38.841 --> 12:41.219
to the children.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.845
Any other surprises?

12:42.887 --> 12:44.723
Honey, I know you're upset

12:42.887 --> 12:44.723
but this is very important.

12:44.763 --> 12:45.973
You know, the fast track.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.475
Zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom!

12:47.517 --> 12:49.810
Yeah, right, okay,

12:47.517 --> 12:49.810
zoom, zoom, zoom.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.020
Right.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.480
Come on, guys, come here.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.065
- Hey, I gotta talk to you guys.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.065
- Go to your daddy.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.025
Now, let me explain

12:54.107 --> 12:56.025
something to you.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.737
First impression

12:56.067 --> 12:58.737
is very critical.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.239
Now, I've found over the years

12:58.777 --> 13:01.239
that the natural part

13:01.281 --> 13:03.283
kind of expresses

13:01.281 --> 13:03.283
a carefree attitude

13:03.324 --> 13:04.951
that can only work

13:03.324 --> 13:04.951
in your favor.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.370
So, let's find that natural

13:04.992 --> 13:07.370
part, shall we, fellas?

13:07.412 --> 13:10.039
Let's find the middle. Ready?

13:07.412 --> 13:10.039
Let's find the natural part.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.751
Shake it out, boys.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.751
Shake it out.

13:12.791 --> 13:16.463
That's good.

13:12.791 --> 13:16.463
Alright.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.881
Honey, I have something

13:16.504 --> 13:18.881
in my teeth.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.635
Here. Slide down to mommy.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.136
Here you go.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.725
Yeah, honey, I have..

13:25.305 --> 13:28.725
I have some kind of a..

13:28.767 --> 13:30.143
...something

13:28.767 --> 13:30.143
in my molar here.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.686
It's a hunk, it's a of walnut.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.605
I have a walnut.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.398
[clicking tongue]

13:42.071 --> 13:44.699
You have any floss, Beck?

13:45.742 --> 13:48.369
Hi. Thanks for being so patient.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.164
That's okay. We were getting the

13:48.411 --> 13:51.164
boys ready for the interview.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.668
- I know. I saw you.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.668
- You saw us?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.169
Oh, yes.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.169
That's a two-way mirror.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.754
We always observe the parents

13:57.796 --> 13:59.506
and children for a few moments.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.091
Floss?

14:02.133 --> 14:04.135
No, no. No, I was just joking.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.135
I knew you were watching.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.679
I was, I was just joking.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.681
I find that a sense of humor

14:05.720 --> 14:07.681
is very important

14:07.722 --> 14:10.558
in the diplomatic corps.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.602
- Perhaps we should begin.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.602
- Good. Listen, my chil--

14:12.644 --> 14:16.147
Our philosophy is if children

14:12.644 --> 14:16.147
are placed on the right track

14:16.189 --> 14:19.359
at an early age, they'll be on

14:16.189 --> 14:19.359
the fast track through life.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.986
Right. Well, that's what

14:19.400 --> 14:21.986
we believe. Zoom! You know..

14:23.488 --> 14:26.199
We've, uh, we've developed

14:23.488 --> 14:26.199
this motto around the house

14:26.240 --> 14:27.908
"fast track, right track

14:27.950 --> 14:29.828
two, two,

14:27.950 --> 14:29.828
two tracks in one."

14:29.869 --> 14:31.621
- Catchy.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.621
- Yeah, I made it up myself.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.748
If your children

14:31.663 --> 14:33.748
are accepted here

14:33.790 --> 14:36.751
you'll be expected to work with

14:33.790 --> 14:36.751
them at home rather intensively

14:36.793 --> 14:40.547
so they may reap the optimum

14:36.793 --> 14:40.547
benefits from our curriculum.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.550
Oh, yeah, well,

14:40.588 --> 14:43.550
our kids love to reap.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.051
Couple of little reapers.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.969
Well, listen, we've really

14:45.092 --> 14:46.969
enjoyed the interview.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.639
Thanks a lot and give us a call

14:47.011 --> 14:49.639
when school starts. Come on.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.349
Well, the interview

14:49.681 --> 14:51.349
hasn't begun.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.809
They need to meet

14:51.391 --> 14:52.809
with the principal

14:52.851 --> 14:54.853
have an intelligence test.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.354
By the way, Mrs. Katsopolis

14:56.396 --> 14:58.773
what language would the children

14:56.396 --> 14:58.773
be most comfortable

14:58.815 --> 15:01.234
taking the test in?

15:01.776 --> 15:03.194
Uh...uh..

15:03.236 --> 15:05.071
Well, you know I like to refer

15:05.112 --> 15:10.493
all the language questions

15:05.112 --> 15:10.493
to my husband the diplomat.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.787
Language.<i> Language.</i>

15:12.829 --> 15:14.873
Well, I feel that

15:12.829 --> 15:14.873
probably English.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.834
English would be easiest

15:14.914 --> 15:17.834
on your people.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.962
Look, Mrs. Jacobs,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.962
we have to be honest.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.841
Well, I have

15:22.004 --> 15:24.841
to be honest.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.261
We may have..

15:24.883 --> 15:28.261
Well, he may have

15:28.302 --> 15:32.432
embellished...lied a bit

15:28.302 --> 15:32.432
on our application.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.810
Honest. She's been on this

15:32.473 --> 15:35.810
honesty kick all week.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.688
Well, we had a feeling

15:35.852 --> 15:38.688
you might have embellished.

15:38.730 --> 15:43.150
Not many two-year-olds

15:38.730 --> 15:43.150
are proficient on the bassoon.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.570
The bassoon?

15:45.612 --> 15:48.865
Well, they're too short

15:45.612 --> 15:48.865
for the cello.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.618
It only shows you want

15:48.907 --> 15:51.618
what's best for your boys.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.869
So, come along, children.

15:52.911 --> 15:55.580
We're gonna have

15:52.911 --> 15:55.580
a wonderful time.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.166
Mrs. Katsopolis.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.166
Ambassador.

16:01.127 --> 16:05.089
(Kimmy)

16:01.127 --> 16:05.089
Oh, I love this song. Come on,

16:01.127 --> 16:05.089
let's sing "Wild Thing."

16:05.131 --> 16:08.050
- Yeah, right!

16:05.131 --> 16:08.050
- This is fun.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.135
Hey.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.638
♪ Wild thing ♪

16:12.555 --> 16:15.642

16:26.235 --> 16:29.071
If this is fun,

16:26.235 --> 16:29.071
we're having it.

16:29.113 --> 16:33.159
Hey, look.

16:29.113 --> 16:33.159
The guys from the chess team.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.829
- Let's rag on them.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.829
- Oh, very mature, Kimmy.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.789
What's the fun of driving

16:35.870 --> 16:37.789
if you can't make fun

16:37.831 --> 16:40.458
of nerds on foot?

16:40.500 --> 16:45.630
You're right. What are they

16:40.500 --> 16:45.630
gonna do, throw a pawn at us?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.047
Hey, let's play ring

16:45.672 --> 16:47.047
around the Chevy.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.301
Alright! What is it?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.136
Well, we get out,

16:50.343 --> 16:52.136
run around the car

16:52.178 --> 16:56.432
and goof on them because we

16:52.178 --> 16:56.432
have wheels and they don't.

16:56.474 --> 17:00.728
The guy with tape

16:56.474 --> 17:00.728
on his glasses is mine.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.777
Hold my hand, Michelle.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.696
Hey, chess boys!

17:11.906 --> 17:13.616
Phew, we just need

17:11.906 --> 17:13.616
a little exercise.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.869
We've been sitting

17:13.658 --> 17:15.869
in our car for so long.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.578
Yeah.

17:17.620 --> 17:22.041
But you wouldn't know the

17:17.620 --> 17:22.041
feeling because you're walking.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.587
Gibbler, my door is locked.

17:26.629 --> 17:28.631
Mine too.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.341
Mine three.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.468
[all laughing]

17:33.761 --> 17:35.972
I must have hit

17:33.761 --> 17:35.972
the power door lock.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.390
We're locked out.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.516
[sighing]

17:38.558 --> 17:40.727
Well, maybe

17:38.558 --> 17:40.727
we can break a window.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.395
We need something hard.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.313
How about Gibbler's head?

17:44.355 --> 17:46.148
We can't break

17:44.355 --> 17:46.148
a window on Wild Thing.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.109
My brother would kill me.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.406
What are we going to do now?

17:54.490 --> 17:56.409
We can get a pizza.

17:56.450 --> 17:59.412
Good idea, Michelle. And how

17:56.450 --> 17:59.412
would you like to get it?

17:59.453 --> 18:01.873
Oh, yeah.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.291
We can have it delivered.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.091
(Michelle)

18:08.671 --> 18:12.091
'Hey, that guy

18:08.671 --> 18:12.091
looks like dad.'

18:12.132 --> 18:14.176
That guy<i> is</i> dad.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.304
Dad. Hi.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.304
Beautiful day.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.514
What brings you out here?

18:18.556 --> 18:21.851
My bike. Why aren't

18:18.556 --> 18:21.851
you in the car?

18:21.893 --> 18:23.686
Well, we were getting cramped

18:23.728 --> 18:27.023
so we thought that we would get

18:23.728 --> 18:27.023
out and stretch our legs.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.316
[grunting]

18:32.403 --> 18:34.739
Well, now that you're

18:32.403 --> 18:34.739
all nice and limber

18:34.781 --> 18:36.991
when are you

18:34.781 --> 18:36.991
gonna get back in?

18:37.033 --> 18:39.326
When we unlock our doors.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.328
What? You're locked out?

18:41.370 --> 18:43.664
We played ring around the Chevy.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.542
The Chevy won.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.002
Girls,

18:46.584 --> 18:48.002
this is very dangerous.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.504
Dad, you're right.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.504
I'm sorry.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.216
- Me too.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.216
- Me three.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.719
Well, apparently,

18:54.258 --> 18:56.719
they're all very sorry.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.930
Can I borrow your bike?

18:58.972 --> 19:00.514
Kimmy, you may have passed

18:58.972 --> 19:00.514
your driver's test

19:00.556 --> 19:03.476
but you have the judgment

19:00.556 --> 19:03.476
of a lima bean.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.811
I'm really disappointed

19:03.517 --> 19:04.811
in all of you.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.520
A car is not a toy.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.398
That's something you can think

19:06.562 --> 19:09.398
about on your walk home.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.733
It's two miles.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.152
Well, then you'll have

19:10.775 --> 19:13.152
plenty of time to think.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.946
I'm gonna go see if those people

19:13.193 --> 19:14.946
will let me use their phone.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.906
I'm gonna call Kimmy's brother.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.450
He may wanna pick up his car..

19:19.492 --> 19:21.577
...though I can't imagine why.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.793
That's great.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.129
I can't believe you locked

19:28.835 --> 19:31.129
the keys in the car.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.672
Now we have to

19:31.170 --> 19:32.672
walk two miles.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.590
[indistinct chattering]

19:35.675 --> 19:38.469
[instrumental music]

19:38.511 --> 19:40.220
Alright, okay,

19:38.511 --> 19:40.220
let's try another one.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.722
Come on, guys.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.722
Now concentrate here please.

19:41.764 --> 19:42.765
Now, watch what I'm doing here.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.725
What is this letter? Come on.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.977
[baby talk]

19:46.019 --> 19:47.645
No "da-da-da."

19:46.019 --> 19:47.645
What is that "da-da-da?"

19:47.687 --> 19:50.857
No, no, it's the first letter

19:47.687 --> 19:50.857
in "frustration."

19:50.898 --> 19:53.067
What is it? Come on.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.652
- Jess, come on.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.652
- Alright, guys, try this.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.237
Jess, look, we've been pushing

19:54.694 --> 19:57.237
the boys all week.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.991
We don't even know if they've

19:57.279 --> 19:59.991
been accepted to Bouton Hall.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.868
It doesn't matter,

20:00.033 --> 20:01.868
if they don't get in Bouton Hall

20:01.909 --> 20:03.577
then we gotta get them

20:01.909 --> 20:03.577
in someplace else, okay?

20:03.619 --> 20:06.288
Guys, shapes.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.288
Time for shapes.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.623
There you go.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.209
Jess, we're not letting them

20:07.665 --> 20:10.209
be kids anymore.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.545
- They're not having any fun.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.545
- Honey, look, they're kids.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.131
They're short, they wear

20:12.586 --> 20:15.131
diapers, they can't vote.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.757
Alright, guys,

20:15.173 --> 20:16.757
come on, let's go.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.259
No, no, no.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.095
Look, son, son, son, please.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.390
Look, the square block goes

20:21.137 --> 20:24.390
into the square hole.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.392
Like that. See?

20:24.431 --> 20:26.392
There you go, pal.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.770
- Try it.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.770
- No, no, no, no.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.814
No, no, no.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.814
Try it.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.191
Jess, just you know what?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.026
We should just back off, okay?

20:35.068 --> 20:36.903
We're getting frustrated,

20:35.068 --> 20:36.903
and so are they.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.362
Sweetheart this is

20:36.944 --> 20:38.362
very important.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.822
I mean, I wish my parents

20:38.404 --> 20:39.822
would have spent

20:39.864 --> 20:43.534
some quality time

20:39.864 --> 20:43.534
like this with me, okay?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.327
Son, no. Son..

20:43.576 --> 20:45.327
Give me that. Give me..

20:45.369 --> 20:48.247
Look, look, see?

20:45.369 --> 20:48.247
This has five sides, okay?

20:48.288 --> 20:49.415
It's called the..

20:49.456 --> 20:51.959
...a five side-agon.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.586
Alright, now, here you go.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.963
Now, come on, please, son,

20:53.627 --> 20:55.963
concentrate for daddy, okay?

20:56.005 --> 20:58.007
Try, now come on,

20:56.005 --> 20:58.007
please concentrate.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.718
Where does

20:58.049 --> 21:00.718
the five side-agon go?

21:05.639 --> 21:08.642
Uh-oh,

21:05.639 --> 21:08.642
daddy got a boo-boo.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.403
- Oh, very sweet.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.403
- Thank you.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.947
You know what, honey?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.282
I think that the boys

21:20.988 --> 21:23.282
are trying to tell us something.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.617
Yeah, we need softer blocks.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.660
- Jess.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.660
- I know.

21:26.702 --> 21:30.330
They hate it,

21:26.702 --> 21:30.330
and I'm pushing them too hard.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.791
It's just that I-I

21:30.372 --> 21:31.791
just want the best

21:31.832 --> 21:33.209
for my little boys,

21:31.832 --> 21:33.209
that's all.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.961
Sweetheart, I know you

21:33.251 --> 21:34.961
want what's best

21:35.002 --> 21:36.087
for them but you know what?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.131
Maybe the fast track

21:36.129 --> 21:38.131
isn't it.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.966
I mean, Nicky and Alex

21:38.172 --> 21:39.966
are normal, healthy kids.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.217
And whatever track

21:40.007 --> 21:41.217
they're on

21:41.259 --> 21:44.178
they seem

21:41.259 --> 21:44.178
to be doing okay.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.308
Maybe I did push this preschool

21:46.388 --> 21:49.308
thing a little bit.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.270
Maybe-maybe Bouton Hall

21:49.349 --> 21:52.270
isn't right for our kids.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.147
You know what, when they're

21:52.311 --> 21:54.147
ready to go to preschool

21:54.188 --> 21:55.648
we'll find the right one

21:55.689 --> 21:58.818
and we'll do everything we can

21:55.689 --> 21:58.818
to encourage them.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.196
Alright.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.196
Come here, you.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.991
Come here, you.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.492
It's just that I

22:05.032 --> 22:06.492
love them so much

22:06.533 --> 22:10.163
and I just want them

22:06.533 --> 22:10.163
to be happy, that's all.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.958
Well, they look

22:11.330 --> 22:13.958
pretty happy to me.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.918
[laughing]

22:17.837 --> 22:19.088
You got a letter.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.506
I thought you'd want to know.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.800
Oh, let me see, sweetheart.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.218
Hey, Jess,

22:22.842 --> 22:24.218
it's from Bouton Hall.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.929
Did Nicky and Alex get in?

22:26.971 --> 22:28.388
Does it matter, honey?

22:28.430 --> 22:29.807
Not in the least.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.684
Alright, then.

22:31.725 --> 22:35.271
Alright,

22:31.725 --> 22:35.271
who wants some ice cream?

22:35.313 --> 22:37.564
You don't have to ask me twice.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.776
Ice cream.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.776
Here we come. Ice cream.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.037
They made it.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.037
They got in.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.040
Does this change anything?

22:54.707 --> 22:57.126
Not a thing.
