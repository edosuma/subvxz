01:55.440 --> 01:57.602
Landscape is destiny.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.842
I've carried that phrase
in my head for years now.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.086
I can't remember where it comes from,
but I know what it means here.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.289
It's a sense of being closed in.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.401
Human limitation.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.660
It's different from the Midwest,

02:21.760 --> 02:26.163
where possibility sprawls bright
and endless in every direction.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.080
People in the Himalayas, the Andes,

02:32.920 --> 02:36.242
do they live in the passive voice, too?

02:38.880 --> 02:41.326
Like their lives aren't real?

02:42.080 --> 02:46.927
Their memories, fixed,

02:48.440 --> 02:50.204
immutable.

03:54.557 --> 03:56.641
That'll be $1.57.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.000
I can take one of 'em off, if you want?

04:05.160 --> 04:06.491
All right, don't worry about it.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.803
- Hey.
- Shut up.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.770
All right. You have a good day now.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.321
Travis?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.331
What just happened here?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.082
Did you let somebody
walk out of here without paying?

04:17.360 --> 04:19.420
You can't quit! You're fired!

04:19.519 --> 04:22.251
If you come back,
I'll have you turned in.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.000
Leave it.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.726
Where have you been?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.220
I called your place.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.971
You know my dad. It don't matter.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.681
Hey.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.500
You ain't gonna believe what I got
in the back of this here truck.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.601
What?

07:35.440 --> 07:37.204
Holy shit!

07:38.480 --> 07:41.260
Just fuckin' found 'em
while I was fishing at the river.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.885
Well, what are you gonna do with it?

07:43.040 --> 07:46.044
Sell 'em, I guess,
if I can figure out who to.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.244
Leonard Shuler will take 'em.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.042
- You reckon?
- Oh, yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.700
Yeah, he'll give you
good money for these.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.963
- Why? He don't know me.
- Well, he knows me.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.167
Shit!

08:08.960 --> 08:11.804
Aw, don't mind them. They're all noise.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.090
He always carry that?

08:20.240 --> 08:21.700
Hell, yeah.

08:21.800 --> 08:26.089
You know, he used to be a teacher
up north, but they kicked his ass out.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.170
The way I heard it
is that he shot some fellow.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.251
Hey, Leonard.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.847
Shank. Who's this?

08:35.600 --> 08:38.284
This here is Travis Shelton.
He's a buddy of mine.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.051
Shelton? You from the Laurel?

08:43.200 --> 08:44.380
No.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.323
My daddy grew up there.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.180
Well, if it's weed you're after,
you're out of luck.

08:52.280 --> 08:56.171
I only got three dime bags at present
and I won't have more till Monday.

08:56.760 --> 09:00.446
Well, looks like we've
come at the right time.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.369
Let's show him.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.482
- Where'd you get these?
- Found them.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.128
Figure finders keepers?

09:26.840 --> 09:28.569
Looks like you dragged them
through a Haybine.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.340
Aw, there's plenty of buzz left.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.886
Really, come on.
How much will you give me for 'em?

09:35.560 --> 09:36.971
Forty bucks.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.645
Nah. Give me $50.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.405
All right.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.890
Put 'em over there in the weeds.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.006
On my tomatoes.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.810
I was thinking that maybe you might
sweeten the deal. How 'bout a beer?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.281
Beer is in the icebox. Help yourself.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.286
Hey.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.404
Hey, show him the pistol.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.403
So that is some
real Dirty Harry shit right there.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.260
Leonard here is a hell of a shot.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.408
He can hit a chigger's ass at 200 feet.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.724
Why don't you let Travis
hold that sweetheart for a second?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.241
I don't think so.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.460
What's that?

10:57.560 --> 10:59.483
That's a metal detector.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.162
A guy wanted some dope, came up short
and used it as collateral.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.482
I use it to find Civil War relics.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.404
What are we listenin' to?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.682
Appalachian Spring by Copland.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.460
I've never heard of him.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.085
He used to open for Skynyrd.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.442
Well, they sound like shit.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.660
- No, it doesn't.
- It does to me.

11:25.760 --> 11:30.322
Well, that's probably because you fail
to empathize with his view of the region.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.281
What?

11:33.800 --> 11:36.246
Oh, y'all got a bathroom in this palace?

11:47.320 --> 11:49.209
I'm just fucking with you, Shank.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.961
I know.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.446
Take your foot off my coffee table.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.722
"December 21st, 1859.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.001
"Naomi Luis, age 22.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.444
"Complaint, sore eyes.

12:43.120 --> 12:47.808
"Diagnosis, optical inflammation
due to handling mistletoe.

12:49.040 --> 12:54.683
"Treatment, wash made of infusion
of goldenseal root in cold water.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.928
"Use twice daily.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.444
"Fee,

13:03.360 --> 13:07.285
"$1 and a quarter. Paid cash."

13:36.560 --> 13:37.925
What do you want?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.728
Come here for a show, is that it?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.201
No.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.931
No?

13:50.840 --> 13:52.808
What's the matter?
You don't like what you see?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.610
Leonard?

13:57.800 --> 13:59.211
All right, boys.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.929
How 'bout one more for the road?

14:02.040 --> 14:03.041
No.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.366
So I take it
you've never been up to Shelton Laurel.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.920
Just family reunions when I was a kid.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.609
Did your daddy ever mention anything
about Bloody Madison to you?

14:17.040 --> 14:18.326
No. What's that?

14:18.600 --> 14:21.285
It's the name this county
went by during the war.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.530
Yeah, you know, I think
my uncle said something once.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.740
That some little kid got killed there

14:28.840 --> 14:30.171
- during the war.
- Killed by who?

14:30.520 --> 14:32.340
Shit, I don't know. Yankees, I guess.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.646
You never asked.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.444
You make it sound like I'm ignorant.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.240
Maybe a little.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.810
Take that shirt you're wearing.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.851
You know if you'd worn that around here in
the 1860s, it would have gotten you killed,

14:46.960 --> 14:48.660
most likely by your own kin.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.603
My people weren't Yankees.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.327
They didn't see any reason
to side with the slave owners.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.243
So, what are you saying?
They were on neither side.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.600
Oh, they had a side.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.769
Couldn't just sit it out, not up here.
Nobody could just sit it out.

15:02.640 --> 15:07.123
In most places,
battle would come, move on.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.001
War came to Madison and stayed.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.602
Hey, we goin' or what?

15:20.680 --> 15:24.366
Hey. We'll fucking get you
some more plants.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.210
I wouldn't advise that.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.620
A smart man would quit
when he was ahead.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.643
Well, didn't you just
tell me I was ignorant.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.524
Travis! You little shit.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.527
Get your ass out of bed.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.721
Now!

16:04.600 --> 16:05.601
Shit.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.844
- Come on.
- All right. Now try it.

16:15.540 --> 16:16.690
I got nothing.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.201
All right.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.806
Hey, we still got kin in Shelton Laurel?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.300
Yeah. Yeah. Why?

16:26.400 --> 16:27.731
I'm just wondering.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.286
Yeah. A few. I ain't seen 'em in years.
Come on.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.209
Well, how come we never go visit?

16:32.560 --> 16:33.561
And say what?

16:38.920 --> 16:40.604
All right. Turn it over.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.761
Well?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.601
Well, what?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.210
Now what do you want me to do?

17:08.440 --> 17:11.046
How about you start by telling me
what went down in that job of yours?

17:12.440 --> 17:14.807
What? You think I didn't
know about that?

17:15.200 --> 17:18.010
Look, Travis, I don't care much
about what you do or where you go,

17:18.119 --> 17:21.380
but I sure in hell mind when you make me
look like trash in front of this community.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.289
Don't you walk away from me.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.210
I can't figure you out.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.801
It's like you got too much damn pride
to work a day,

17:28.960 --> 17:30.700
a day, like regular folks.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.010
Stocking shelves, stocking shelves,
that's way, way beneath you, isn't it?

17:36.480 --> 17:38.209
When was the last time
you had a damn job?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.483
Harvey, stop!

17:51.200 --> 17:53.601
That's enough. That's enough.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.005
Travis.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.380
Pick that shit up, will you?

18:51.480 --> 18:53.403
What the hell does it
look like I'm doin'?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.210
Call Dooley.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.162
Tell him we're gonna be
delivering Saturday.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.210
Well, well, look at this.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.940
I'll be damned.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.769
Near about cut off, looks like.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.620
We can take him down there
and stick him in the river,

19:41.720 --> 19:44.166
maybe he's fallen, drowned himself.

19:44.280 --> 19:48.205
Another one. Even Sheriff Spence...

19:48.560 --> 19:49.925
All right.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.087
This ain't gonna hurt much.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.406
Give him some water.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.200
Oh, God.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.405
You is lucky.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.889
Didn't tear any ligaments up.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.882
Barely grazed the bone.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.567
Don't get infected, you'll be fine.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.460
What did you do?

20:52.560 --> 20:54.688
Just shaved a little skin
off of your leg.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.127
Can't even tell it's a trap now.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.842
Looks like you just slipped
and skinned it up.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.364
Who's your people?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.689
My daddy's Harvey Shelton.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.330
Is that right?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.660
I would've figured you to be stouter.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.683
You must favor your ma.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.500
I'll need to get to a doctor.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.045
In time.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.687
Stick him down there in the river
before it's too late.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.527
- We ain't doin' that, so shut up about it.
- Shit.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.540
Now, the sooner me and you
get a few things clear,

21:31.640 --> 21:34.060
the quicker you get to a doctor,
you understand?

21:34.160 --> 21:35.207
Yes, sir.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.361
All right.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.164
Anybody asks,

21:38.880 --> 21:40.882
you slipped climbing up the gorge.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.540
Slipped...

21:42.640 --> 21:46.645
You never saw no crop,
you was never on my land,

21:47.080 --> 21:48.923
damn sure never saw me.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.529
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.131
He ain't gonna do it.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.460
Soon as he gets to that hospital,
he'll be testifying...

21:56.560 --> 21:59.300
No, I won't. I won't, I won't.
I swear to you, Mr. Toomey.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.561
Mr. Toomey, please, I swear to you.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.081
I swear to you,
I won't say nothing, I swear.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.445
Pick him up.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.249
Come on.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.500
Oh, shit!

22:22.600 --> 22:23.931
- God!
- Get up.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.450
One more thing.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.769
Who did you sell those plants to?

22:37.120 --> 22:38.740
Leonard Shuler.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.207
- Does he know where you got 'em?
- No, sir.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.561
All right.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.241
Now, I told you I'd get you here.

23:05.360 --> 23:09.046
I kept my word,
you see that you keep yours.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.380
- Carlton?
- Professor.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.369
What brings you around? Come on in.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.727
Hubert.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.340
I thought you got called up.

23:52.440 --> 23:55.140
My number one son here is 4-F.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.527
Draft board didn't say why.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.684
I got my own suspicions about that.

24:02.200 --> 24:05.170
Well, you're better off here, anyway.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.371
What can I do for you?

24:08.560 --> 24:11.340
I got some business to discuss with you.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.460
Okay.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.006
Especially seeing
how you got a new supplier and all.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.210
That boy.

24:25.720 --> 24:26.940
I didn't know you was growing.

24:27.040 --> 24:31.762
To be fair, our crops are new things.
His idea.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.450
Times are changin'.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.820
We gotta give the people what they want.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.604
Speaking of which,

24:39.480 --> 24:42.848
seven fourteens of
black beauties, even split.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.009
$100 will cover it.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.561
There you go.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.180
Much obliged, sir.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.281
Hey, babe.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.969
Still with you, I see.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.281
Must cut into your profits, though.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.647
She been rode hard,
but she's still pretty.

25:17.080 --> 25:21.210
We'll be happy to take her off your
hands if you're ever so inclined.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.285
But listen to me pontificating.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.602
Time I was on my way.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.124
Carlton, that boy,

25:34.520 --> 25:36.124
what'd you do to him?

25:38.280 --> 25:43.810
Let's just say
he's retired from the drug trade.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.969
I'll see you around, Professor.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.803
How you doin'? Not too much pain?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.325
I know you.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.730
Wasn't... We was in homeroom together.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.540
Right. Travis. Travis Shelton.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.847
Yeah. Lori.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.900
Right. Miss Heywood's class.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.684
- Right.
- Yeah.

26:22.320 --> 26:26.542
Well, you got your leg cut up
pretty good there, Travis Shelton.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.531
How does it feel?

26:28.640 --> 26:29.641
Oh, it's okay.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.409
So it hurts like hell, right?

26:32.800 --> 26:33.801
Yeah.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.160
Here. Let me help you with that.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.420
What you readin'?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.124
Oh, nothing. Just boring old stuff.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.365
Can I have a look?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.365
Yeah, sure, if you want.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.251
"Both the Union and the Confederate
planned their attack strategically. They..."

26:57.360 --> 27:00.125
Oh, we were learnin'
about this in history, right?

27:00.560 --> 27:02.244
Oh. Yeah, right.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.201
I was just...

27:05.160 --> 27:09.768
You know about all the stories Sherman...
This whole scorched earth thing he did.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.690
Can I get you anything?

27:18.040 --> 27:19.724
Cigarette would be nice.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.202
Oh, I don't smoke.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.405
And neither should you.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.007
- Rubber bands.
- Rubber bands.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.930
I brought you some books.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.481
Here you go.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.364
To keep you company.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.884
Well, you know, I'm getting out real soon,
how am I gonna get 'em back to you?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.331
Can I call you here?

28:19.160 --> 28:20.161
Sure.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.724
Got a number or...

28:23.680 --> 28:24.806
Yeah.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.966
- You got a...
- You want to write on my hand.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.401
Sure.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.880
Here you go.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.449
- Don't forget and wash it off.
- I'll not do that.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.291
Bye.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.004
Does it still hurt?

29:01.400 --> 29:03.846
Doctor says I can be out
day after tomorrow.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.164
Then what are you gonna do?

29:10.080 --> 29:11.081
I don't know.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.020
Shank's got some friends
who own an auto shop.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.690
They said they were
gonna give me some hours.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.688
But what about a place to live?

29:24.640 --> 29:28.440
I just think that
you shouldn't come home right now.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.050
- Just for a while.
- Is that what he told you to say?

29:33.280 --> 29:35.123
He's angry, Travis.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.401
You dented his pride
saying those things you did.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.140
- You know how he is.
- Yeah. He's an asshole.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.722
The two of you goin' at it all the time.

29:46.440 --> 29:50.206
I just want some peace
in my house for once.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.610
What the hell are you doin' here?

30:36.640 --> 30:38.404
I got no place else to go.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.411
- Jesus Christ.
- Come on. I...

30:42.240 --> 30:44.846
I ain't askin' much. A sofa, that's all.

30:55.280 --> 30:58.124
All right. So I'm not good enough
for your shitty trailer, is that it?

30:59.240 --> 31:01.686
Lord, you get them hackles out fast.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.690
Well, you're young.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.203
World's gonna have its way with you.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.611
Knock some of that strut out of you,
that's for sure.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.700
I ain't afraid of you.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.201
I ain't the one
you ought to be afraid of.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.208
If you're gonna eat my cereal
and read my books, make some coffee.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.604
That's the local regiment.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.446
Met a sorry fate, too.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.363
Shit, you seen this one?

32:40.360 --> 32:42.966
Twelve years old, David Shelton.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.491
Shelton?

32:44.880 --> 32:46.928
There's four of 'em
in this regiment, see?

32:47.240 --> 32:50.323
Father, three boys.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.564
It's your kin.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.927
So, they all died?

32:59.320 --> 33:01.163
Even the boy?

33:02.480 --> 33:04.801
Why kill him? He was just a kid.

33:08.560 --> 33:10.483
'Cause a nit makes a louse.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.405
At least that's what
one of the soldiers said.

33:15.600 --> 33:19.366
Your daddy never told you
about any of this?

33:20.560 --> 33:21.800
No.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.570
Shit!

33:38.520 --> 33:39.851
Be right back.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.483
Rednecks and drugs.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.964
One of the worst hookups of the '60s.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.130
Didn't seem to bother you none
when he took your money.

34:10.639 --> 34:12.210
I suppose not.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.161
I'd like to go there.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.282
- Go where?
- To Shelton Laurel.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.085
I wanna see it for myself.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.009
You can tell we're getting close.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.690
Look at the mailboxes.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.770
Shelton.

34:52.199 --> 34:55.487
Shelton, Shelton, Shelton.
It's a one-horse town.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.001
Why'd you quit school, anyway?

35:01.840 --> 35:04.844
Because what they taught me
there didn't interest me much.

35:06.560 --> 35:07.891
You like to read.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.100
About things I'm interested in, sure.

35:10.200 --> 35:14.205
How about taking your GED,
ever think of that?

35:14.360 --> 35:16.806
Give you some qualification.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.243
Help you get a better job.

35:20.320 --> 35:22.891
You don't want to be stockin' shelves
for the rest of your life, do you?

35:24.800 --> 35:26.060
I guess not.

35:26.160 --> 35:27.889
It'll be a lot of work, though.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.044
Think you're up to it?

35:33.920 --> 35:35.729
Why, do you?

35:45.720 --> 35:46.721
So...

35:48.560 --> 35:52.963
You think I could stay
until I get it done?

36:04.840 --> 36:06.285
All right.

36:18.320 --> 36:23.087
You know a place is haunted
when it feels more real than you are.

36:25.840 --> 36:30.767
It's like time doesn't pass,
it just layers over things.

36:31.440 --> 36:36.207
It's all still happening underneath
the surface of what we see.

36:37.680 --> 36:38.681
You feel that?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.804
Well, you should.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.286
It's your family's blood
that got spilled here.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.487
It's what I told you,
South was never one thing,

36:53.680 --> 36:55.967
history is never that clear-cut.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.609
Even your kin,
the ones that got killed here,

36:59.960 --> 37:02.247
they weren't exactly blameless.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.327
Still, it's no reason to kill
a 12-year-old boy.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.700
Oh, so, you'd have wanted revenge
if you'd been there?

37:08.800 --> 37:10.370
For killing one of my kin,

37:10.960 --> 37:12.883
shit, what do you think?

37:14.040 --> 37:16.361
I think violence begets violence.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.445
It doesn't stop.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.085
It's like a sickness.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.448
Just gets passed on
from one generation to the next.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.644
Hey, can I try?

37:41.160 --> 37:42.161
Yeah.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.081
All right.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.566
Hey, I got something.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.645
Let me listen.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.486
You hear that?

38:11.360 --> 38:12.725
Move it over a little.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.650
That's a rock.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.570
How do you know?

38:19.760 --> 38:21.205
Experience.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.131
What you got?

38:39.240 --> 38:40.401
I don't know.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.521
Gently now.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.125
Holy shit.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.204
It got to belong to one of the victims.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.289
Else one of Keith's men
would've picked them up.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.811
You think they're his?

39:43.960 --> 39:44.961
The boy's.

39:45.440 --> 39:46.441
The boy's... What's his name?

39:50.520 --> 39:51.806
David Shelton.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.081
You can't grow up here
and not feel something.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.323
Whether it's Christian or not, though...

40:25.160 --> 40:26.844
I remember when my granddaddy passed,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.641
my grandma went around
and covered every mirror in the house.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.488
She kept them that way all winter, too.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.246
She figured

40:37.920 --> 40:39.001
they is portals

40:39.640 --> 40:42.041
and the dead might find their way
back into this world.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.080
See, that's old faith.

40:48.760 --> 40:50.205
That's the mountain gospel.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.281
But, hey.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.370
You don't believe that, do you?

41:00.080 --> 41:01.320
Oh, I don't know.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.930
God took to me early.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.607
At least that's what
somebody told me once.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.409
Tomorrow we'll take those
over to Hensley's.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.244
I'll swing by the vocational school.

41:15.880 --> 41:17.723
See what you need to do for that GED.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.023
Dr. Bradley to 744.

41:25.123 --> 41:27.980
Dr. Bradley to 744.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.580
Oh, yeah.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.170
Your friend's here.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.762
Oh!

41:35.120 --> 41:37.088
You're not supposed to be here.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.522
Here, come in here.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.929
I just wanted to
bring these back to you in person.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.482
Oh! Thank you.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.250
I read them both.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.011
I really liked them, too,
especially Hemingway. It's...

41:50.600 --> 41:51.806
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.300
I mean, it's horrible,
but the writing is so beautiful.

41:55.400 --> 41:56.765
Right, right.

41:57.560 --> 41:58.800
That dude's badass.

41:59.769 --> 42:01.446
Yeah, yeah.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.766
Look, I was wondering if...

42:07.240 --> 42:08.241
What?

42:09.760 --> 42:11.842
If maybe I could see you
sometime this week.

42:14.440 --> 42:17.125
Yeah. Sure.

42:18.840 --> 42:19.841
Okay.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.329
I better get back to work.

42:23.760 --> 42:27.463
Better get out of here
before you get me fired.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.048
All right, well...

42:31.760 --> 42:32.807
- Okay.
- Okay.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.409
How often is the GED given?

42:39.800 --> 42:42.007
First Thursday
and first Saturday of the month.

42:43.440 --> 42:44.885
When do you think they'll be ready?

42:45.520 --> 42:48.046
He might be ready by December.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.404
He's got some catching up to do.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.330
So do I, by the looks of things.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.571
Math was never my strong suit.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.769
Yeah, I remember.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.860
If it'd been better you would've
got a scholarship out of state

43:00.960 --> 43:03.008
like I hoped for you, Leonard.

43:03.600 --> 43:07.047
Maybe far enough
so you wouldn't find your way back here.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.527
I'm glad I'm not at the
high school anymore.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.250
Fewer disappointments here.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.601
The...

43:17.000 --> 43:19.480
Mr. Shuler. Could we have a moment?

43:22.160 --> 43:23.161
Is everything all right?

43:23.440 --> 43:25.363
Is it my wife?

43:37.680 --> 43:38.886
It's over.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.846
Nowhere's going to hire you
after something like this.

43:47.240 --> 43:48.890
Why won't you do anything?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.570
They'd already made up their minds.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.565
Nothing I could do.

43:57.360 --> 43:58.725
But you won't even try.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.086
Well, what did he say?

44:15.560 --> 44:17.085
Just like I thought,

44:17.720 --> 44:19.484
they're kid's spectacles, mid 1800s.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.565
They're David Shelton's.

44:23.760 --> 44:24.921
I know it.

45:27.840 --> 45:28.841
I'm going in.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.161
Already?

45:30.520 --> 45:31.521
You're gonna burn.

45:31.640 --> 45:32.641
I'll be fine.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.128
Give those dogs any water today?

45:36.240 --> 45:37.446
I can do it.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.723
Give them tomatoes
a soak while you're at it.

46:15.480 --> 46:16.481
What's wrong?

46:20.680 --> 46:22.205
I'm talking to you.

46:24.520 --> 46:26.045
So, what? There's three of us now?

46:27.640 --> 46:29.210
He's just stopping here a while.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.484
It's not a permanent thing.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.722
You don't just get your
family back, Leonard.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.020
- It ain't that simple.
- That's not what this is about.

46:40.120 --> 46:42.248
You just feel real helpful,
all of a sudden.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.620
'Cause he's such a great kid,
got so much promise, is that it?

46:44.720 --> 46:46.290
Why don't you give me a break?

46:48.840 --> 46:50.205
Give me something and I will.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.926
And when you're screwing me tonight,
leave the goddamn lights on.

47:13.200 --> 47:14.884
I'm sick of you pretending like I'm her.

47:35.760 --> 47:37.046
Where's...

47:37.200 --> 47:38.611
Cicero.

47:39.320 --> 47:40.300
Where's that?

47:40.400 --> 47:41.340
North.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.090
Why do we have to go?

47:49.920 --> 47:52.764
"December 21st, 1859.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.244
"Summoned to Shelton Farm.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.767
"David Shelton, age eight.

48:08.480 --> 48:09.811
"Symptoms,

48:11.880 --> 48:13.166

48:56.840 --> 48:58.683

49:02.040 --> 49:03.724
"Two spoons of Laudanum,

49:05.560 --> 49:08.291
"prepared family
for possible dismal reckoning."

49:11.080 --> 49:12.445
What you looking at?

49:12.760 --> 49:14.524
Just some of this junk.

49:16.680 --> 49:19.331
Trying to see if I could find out
more about David Shelton.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.325
It's really got you hooked.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.089
I know.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.369
I just keep thinking about him
ever since we went up to the Laurel.

49:31.560 --> 49:34.450
I mean, that kid's for five years
younger than I am

49:35.560 --> 49:37.961
and he's already a soldier.

49:39.240 --> 49:41.686
Already got himself a cause.

50:28.240 --> 50:29.287
Go on.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.728
You're old enough to know
where you come from now.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.208
You need to know your smarts
didn't just spring up

50:36.320 --> 50:38.766
like some daisy in a bunch of hogweed.

50:40.080 --> 50:42.242
There were smart folk
in our family before.

50:44.080 --> 50:47.289
Your great-great-grandfather
was a doctor.

50:48.680 --> 50:50.011
Joshua Candler.

50:51.640 --> 50:52.846
He was assigned to the 64th.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.082
It was them that done
the killing in the Laurel.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.771
He knew every man
and boy that got killed.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.571
He was their doctor before the war.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.168
And he just let it happen.

51:25.320 --> 51:26.321
Hi.

51:26.640 --> 51:27.846
Hi, baby.

51:28.880 --> 51:29.961
Let's walk.

51:30.680 --> 51:31.681
Still nothing?

51:33.560 --> 51:34.846
You got to be patient.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.321
It don't happen fast.

51:36.520 --> 51:38.010
Should've done it earlier.

51:56.040 --> 51:57.280
All stuck.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.968
- Oh!
- Don't you be coming up here.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.050
You're all wet.

52:13.040 --> 52:14.041
Oh, stop.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.241
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

52:25.680 --> 52:28.809
It's not like I don't want to. I do.

52:31.480 --> 52:34.700
It's just all I see at work
is girls who made mistakes.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.643
And I'm not going to be like them.

52:37.880 --> 52:41.407
I'm gonna get out of here
and go to college, see things.

52:43.800 --> 52:46.007
Doesn't mean I don't like you.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.683
Come on, kiss me.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.129
Big time with your lady yesterday?

53:15.080 --> 53:16.809
Did she get you off all right?

53:19.120 --> 53:20.565
Where is Leonard?

53:21.280 --> 53:22.850
Not back.

53:23.720 --> 53:25.131
I can get you some booze.

53:26.960 --> 53:29.201
Evidently this trailer
pull ain't enough.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.086
What?

53:48.800 --> 53:50.689
Two of you are quite a pair.

53:51.840 --> 53:54.127
You quit school, he gets fired from one.

53:55.760 --> 53:57.205
Dumb kid, same as you.

53:58.400 --> 54:01.085
How some punk
cheating on his test reported him.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.442
Kid got some weed,
put it in his car and called the cops.

54:04.640 --> 54:06.165
Arrested him right there
in his classroom.

54:07.680 --> 54:09.489
Wasn't long before his wife left him.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.040
She got custody, too.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.411
Leonard's got a kid?

54:13.880 --> 54:15.370
You didn't know that?

54:17.680 --> 54:19.808
Yeah, Leonard's a daddy, all right.

54:21.160 --> 54:22.650
But he don't see them no more.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.602
They off in Australia, I think.

54:40.040 --> 54:42.691
You know you're kind of pretty
under that sneer?

54:44.520 --> 54:45.885
Don't.

54:50.920 --> 54:52.331
Why not?

54:53.880 --> 54:55.860
What do you mean, "Why not"?
'Cause it wouldn't be right.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.460
- That's why.
- Wouldn't be right?

54:57.560 --> 54:59.180
That's okay.

54:59.280 --> 55:01.044
I don't mind.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.045
I don't mind.

55:09.840 --> 55:12.730
Squeeze it.

55:13.840 --> 55:16.730
Feel good, don't it?

55:26.320 --> 55:27.685
What's the matter?

55:28.240 --> 55:30.925
No, sweetheart... I ain't got you some.

55:35.200 --> 55:36.964
You think she know a lot of tricks?

55:37.960 --> 55:41.043
I've been fucking since before
she could wipe her own ass.

55:48.480 --> 55:49.481
Ha!

55:50.080 --> 55:51.411
All right, come on.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.340
You had it before.

55:54.440 --> 55:55.949
Give me...

56:00.440 --> 56:01.851
Here he is.

56:02.160 --> 56:03.889
The outlaw.

56:05.240 --> 56:07.004
How's it going with Leonard?

56:07.160 --> 56:08.685
You boys in business yet?

56:08.800 --> 56:10.165
I don't know.

56:10.880 --> 56:12.291
Hey, what do you got
stashed in the truck?

56:12.400 --> 56:14.420
Get your fat ass off my truck
before you fucking break it.

56:14.520 --> 56:17.171
You don't even have a dime bag
for your buddy.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.220
Leonard been practicing?

56:19.320 --> 56:20.651
Been practicing for what?

56:20.840 --> 56:22.060
The county fair is tomorrow.

56:22.160 --> 56:24.128
He got himself a title to defend.

56:24.520 --> 56:26.124
Dude don't need no practicing.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.767
I mean, hell, everyone knows
he's a stone-cold killer.

56:29.160 --> 56:30.161
Like me.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.560
You see that?

56:34.160 --> 56:36.580
What? You got one of your
mama's kitchen knives?

56:36.680 --> 56:38.011
Tell him to come down here and watch.

56:38.120 --> 56:40.248
I think he could learn something.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.005
All right, I want to see.

57:05.880 --> 57:08.611
You know, they say you shot
some guy up in Illinois.

57:13.760 --> 57:14.761
Well, did you?

57:16.440 --> 57:18.249
Depends on what incident you mean.

57:18.960 --> 57:20.380
The one where I shot
the guy in both shoulders

57:20.480 --> 57:22.369
or the one whose hand I blew off.

57:25.680 --> 57:26.681
What?

57:26.960 --> 57:28.644
I never shot anybody in my life.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.403
I've never bothered to set
the record straight.

57:34.880 --> 57:38.202
Folks I deal with, it's better if they think
I'm a little tougher than I am.

57:40.440 --> 57:42.169
Is that why you're doing the contest?

57:44.360 --> 57:45.805
Partly.

58:01.640 --> 58:03.244
Tickets are on me.

58:04.480 --> 58:05.780
Wow, big spender.

58:05.880 --> 58:07.450
Thank you.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.969
Wow, I didn't figure it'd be
this crowded for the weekend.

58:10.200 --> 58:13.283
They've come to see Leonard
whip everyone's ass, that's why.

58:13.480 --> 58:14.811
What time is the tournament?

58:15.200 --> 58:17.060
It's the last event, 8:30.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.940
Yeah? All right, well, I guess
we'll see you then?

58:20.040 --> 58:21.246
Come on.

58:24.080 --> 58:25.411
Young love.

58:26.080 --> 58:27.445
I want to take her back.

58:28.600 --> 58:29.886
Little bit.

58:40.760 --> 58:42.171
What do you want to ride? The carousel?

58:45.920 --> 58:47.126
You gonna win me something?

58:47.280 --> 58:48.566
No, come on, let's do another one.

58:48.920 --> 58:50.285
Come on.

58:50.960 --> 58:52.620
Leonard is the sharpshooter, not me.

58:52.720 --> 58:53.721
Oh, give it a try, son.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.291
Can't win it if you ain't in it.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.811
I can do this.

59:06.200 --> 59:08.282
Hey. Quit it, all right?

59:11.280 --> 59:12.441
Sights are off.

59:14.760 --> 59:15.761
Here we go.

59:22.440 --> 59:23.930
I think it's the sights.
They're always off.

59:24.240 --> 59:25.241
Oh, really?

59:25.560 --> 59:26.561
Yeah.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.340
- You're a doober.
- Oh, really?

59:29.440 --> 59:31.329
Let's see you do it?
Let's see you...

59:40.480 --> 59:42.323
Thanks a lot.

59:43.320 --> 59:45.580
All right, we got us a friend
we want to bring up here.

59:45.680 --> 59:46.841
What do y'all think about that?

59:48.520 --> 59:51.330
Well, come on, put your hands together,
he's got a song for you.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:13.802
I'm a poor wayfaring stranger

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.405
traveling through

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.883
this world of woe

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:29.681
There's no sickness, toil or danger

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.366
In that bright land to which I go

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.411
I'm going there to see my father

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:49.250
I'm going there no more to roam

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.362
I'm only going over Jordan

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.571
I'm only going over home

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.449
I'm going there to see my mother

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:16.324
She said she'd meet me when I come

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.007
I'm only going over Jordan

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.603
I'm only going over home

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.686
That was awesome.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.766
Incredible.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.921
Where is Dena?

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.480
I guess she never showed up.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.889
I didn't see her,
but I'm sure she's around.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.002
Let's go, Travis. Let's look for her.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.400
What you want to do?

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.961
Go.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.326
Evening, Professor.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.123
I didn't know that you had company.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.565
The little bastard lives here.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.726
Well, well.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.685
How's that leg healing up?

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.850
I saw you at the fair.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.563
You liked my singing, didn't you?

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.965
You know, there's some

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.721
that said

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.684
I should've made a living at it.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.682
Gone to Nashville, tried my luck.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.364
That never tempted me much.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:46.090
Now, I sang at a big tent revival

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.084
up in the hot springs.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.164
Just as I am

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.128
without one plea

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.129
And then there was never saved,

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.810
and then there was backsliders,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.925
who were wailing and crying
and getting right with the Lord,

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.044
because of my song.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.490
Even the preacher said so.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.283
So, the way I figure it,

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.162
I've done enough good for Jesus

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.607
that the Lord just might cut me
some slack in other aspects.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.126
Just like he did old King David.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.980
Oh, there she is.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.127
All prettied up.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.291
We going or what?

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.411
Oh, yes, ma'am.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.130
Don't you worry,

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.805
we'll bring her back safe and sound.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.645
Something you want to say?

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.045
She's 30 years old,

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.290
she should look after herself.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.728
I don't think she knows how.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.325
Well, maybe not.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.043
It's too late to teach her now.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.800
What happened here anyway?

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.088
Why is it so special?

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.281
People died.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.567
Families turned on each other, starved.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.364
Typical Appalachian story.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.130
It was his kin, right?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.451
That's all he talks about.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.368
The war and this boy.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.566
David Shelton.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.890
I think it's good.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.806
Good to know where you come from.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.044
Yeah, I don't know.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.580
I think he needs to start
worrying less about the past

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.409
and start thinking more
about the future.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.771
I can feel it now.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.441
It's haunted.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.970
It's a haunted place, all right.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.608
Hey, are you okay, little girl?

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.564
- I'm freezing.
- Freezing.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.841
Hey, come here.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.405
We'll get going, come on.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.801
You all right?

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.321
Hey, there you are.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.126
Will you boil some water?

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.020
- What?
- Just do it, please.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.167
Why?

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.725
You're always taking care of me.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.685
Always despising me for it.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.761
I'd have stayed with them
if they would have let me.

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:51.210
At least I don't pretend
I'm someone else.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.121
Came to speak to Carlton if he's home.

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:17.482
Well, this here is unexpected.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.571
Don't tell nobody that you
caught me with the newspapers.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.243
It's bad for my image.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.700
You get a fellow believing
that he's smarter than you,

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.724
you can get him to do
any damn thing you want.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.526
How are you on crosswords?

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.161
What are you stuck on?

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.928
Ten-letter word

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.685
for "surrender."

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.804
Seventh letter is

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.520
"Capitulate."

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.171
There you go.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.042
What can I do for you, Professor?

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.043
I'm not gonna deal anymore.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:16.048
"Detract from authority,
reputation or prestige."

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.481
Eight letters, starts with "D."

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.321
"Derogate."

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.845
No, third letter is an

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.325
"Diminish."

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.765
You got a gift, Professor.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.566
I always said so.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.049
So, why are you telling me this now?

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.802
Oh, I just figured
I'd get out while I was ahead.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.300
Spence is starting to make...

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.687
He won't bother anybody
that works for me.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.445
Oh, here's a big'un.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.050
Fourteen letters for "mistake."

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.011
"Miscalculation."

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.401
I'm bored.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.325
It's boring here,
you and him just reading all the time.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.731
Why don't you put on the TV?

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.884
I don't wanna put on the TV.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.044
Give me something.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.050
That all you got?

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.690
Ain't very many.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.923
Maybe you ought to
think about cutting down.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.241
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.570
I'm serious.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.600
You ought to try it.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.570
I'm a fucking drug addict, Leonard,
have you noticed?

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.046
I'm sorry.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.921
I was like this when
we started, remember?

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.242
Remember? You said you didn't mind.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.965
It was like this, too.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.091
I didn't mind.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.487
But things have changed.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.328
I went to go see Toomey today.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.807
And told him that
I didn't want to deal anymore.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.922
We can still get stuff, right?

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.850
Not if I'm not working for him.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.645
Calm down. Calm down.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.531
No, wait a minute.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.045
Why'd you do that?

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.168
'Cause I'm trying to do right.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.921
And I'm sick of it.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.326
You're sick of it?

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.566
You're sick of it?

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.121
What about me?

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.725
What about what I need?

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.480
You're sick of it?

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.483
Then tell me, son of a bitch.
What about what I need?

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.410
What am I gonna do?

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.008
Wait a minute. Don't walk away from me.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.522
Don't walk away from me!

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.847
You motherfucker!

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.884
"July 14th, 1857, 10:00 p.m.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.684
"Summoned to Winchester Farm.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.601
"Hayley Winchester, age 19.

"Complaint, remittent fever,

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.085
Can I get a beer, please?

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.326
"Diagnosis,

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.643
"puerperal fever due to rupture
and infection of uterus."

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.325
- I'm Dena.
- Leonard.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.881
- Leonard, nice to meet you.
- And you.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.967
Thanks for saying hello.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.246
What you reading?

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.687
A book by Walker Percy,
Love in the Ruins.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.365
Is it about love?

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.140
"Treatment..."

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.300
Might be.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.882
"...camphor, boneset tea,
but patient too distressed to drink.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.201

"galloping pulse, violent shivering."

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.529
Did you do those questions
I set out for you?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.445
Yeah, almost.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.361
Well, do them. I'll check them.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.205
"1:20 a.m.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.050

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.245
"Fee, none."

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.001
This is the spot.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.300
I thought they'd each have a grave.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.340
It was almost January, remember.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.169
The ground was harder than this.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.810
It's amazing one hole got dug.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.163
- That colonel?
- Keith.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.886
Yeah, Keith.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.648
Book said he tried them as looters.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.100
It's a legal distinction. A bushwhacker
is a common criminal, not a soldier.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.645
The same rights don't apply.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.444
Well, I guess you were happier
before you knew any of this.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.368
Wasn't like I was so carefree.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.725
No?

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.771
Not really.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.842
I was just asleep, I guess.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.928
Same as everybody.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.368
Still, there ain't no going back now.

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.290
All right, open your booklets and begin.

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.606
That's all.

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:17.649
Put your pencils down
and bring your test to me.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.480
How'd you do?

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.644
Okay, I guess.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.980
That math was tough.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.890
I did what you said. Narrowed it down
to two and guessed, but...

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.140
How long till you find out the result?

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.165
Mr. Edwards said we could call him
at home. Anytime after 5:00.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.291
Well?

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.690
I passed.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.530
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.540
You know, I do appreciate
everything you've done for me.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.260
No, I do. You didn't know me from Adam.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.601
And I won't forget that.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.569
So, are you gonna just keep on going,
maybe get a degree?

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.686
Shit, I don't know. Maybe.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.140
'Cause there's Western, there's Appalachian.
Hell, there's even Chapel Hill.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.460
- Jesus, Leonard!
- I'm just saying.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.100
You play this right, this could be the
start of a whole big thing for you.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.281
All right, I know.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.891
Don't go planning out my whole life
for me just yet.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.042
Just wanted you to be aware
of the possibilities, that's all.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:07.205
Anyway, you gotta go celebrate.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.004
- You and Lori.
- Yeah.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.044
You know what, I'm gonna call her now.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.450
Hey.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.100
She's dressing up special pretty
for you tonight.

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.601
You're gonna think she's one of
those models in the catalogs.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.361
Hey.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.805
- Wow, you look incredible.
- Didn't I tell you?

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.124
My girl polishes up real good.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.361
Mama!

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.611
You have a good time.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.180
That's cool.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.760
- See you later, Mama.
- All right. Thank you.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.960
Come here.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.490
There'll be more of that later.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.340
I invited your mama and your daddy.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.940
Which one of them you talk to?

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.900
I talked to your mama on the phone
and she was real nice,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.446
and she said she'd been
wanting to meet me.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.140
- She said he was coming, too?
- Yep.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.686
She said both of them were coming.
Come on.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.091
I'm so proud of you.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.882
- You must be Lori.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.604
Well, look at how pretty you are!

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.569
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:36.209
Daddy couldn't make it tonight.
He's just so busy.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.641
And he's got so many things to do.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.401
Like what?

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.820
Well, he fixed that fence out back.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.365
In the dark?

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.203
Why you being so rude?
You didn't say near two words all dinner.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.650
It don't matter about any of this.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.848
You think it does, but it don't.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.700
You can get out of here if you want.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.768
Move to Chapel Hill.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.406
Both of us go to college,
work part-time.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.321
Well, I guess you
got it all figured out.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.450
You and Leonard.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.660
We just want you to succeed is all.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.728
You have so much potential.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.960
Travis!

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.082
I gotta go see my old man,

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.602
that poor bastard who's
got chores all day and night.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.763
I've come to tell you something.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.290
Spit it out. I'm listening.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:21.604
You know, I've done something
you couldn't do.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.402
I done it all on my own, too.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.260
I expect you're right.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.540
You know, I never had
much of an education, no doubt.

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.540
But one thing for sure, I got more pride

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.642
than to hang my hat
with some drug-dealing lowlife.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:36.525
Leonard's more of a man
than you'll ever be.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.900
You know, I'd have hauled you out of
there if I thought it'd do some good.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.570
But it wouldn't. You know why?
'Cause trash always...

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.001
Fuck you! I ain't trash,
you piece of shit.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.247
Harv, don't rile him, please.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.162
You like him, don't you? That teacher.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.140
You trust him. You admire him.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.247
Yeah, a lot more than you,
that's for sure.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.300
Well, that's kind of ironic, isn't it?

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.243
Him being a Candler and all.

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.601
Candler.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.486
Don't that name mean anything to you?

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:25.380
Seems there is a limit
to your education.

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.450
Your buddy, Shuler,

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.450
his mama's great-granddaddy
helped kill off nearly half your kin.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.900
But I guess he didn't mention that.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.606
He forgot to teach you
that part, didn't he?

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.768
Candler. Look it up.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.042
Seeing as how you're
the scholar in the family.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.242
Travis, come on. Let's go home.

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.681
Come on.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.940
On January 18th, 1863,

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.008
the day of the massacre,

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.090
there was no entry
in Joshua Candler's journal.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.323
No mention of the prisoners
or Shelton Laurel.

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.648
Only a blank page.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.480
Whiteness.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.340
We gotta get you some ludes, son.
You're strung up pretty tight.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.620
Travis seems back to his old self.
Ready to raise some hell tonight.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.927
- Is that right?
- That's right.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.580
About time, boy.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.740
- You wanna get fucked up?
- You got it. Got some catching up...

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.140
Missed you, boy. Let's get fucked up.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.260
- Let's get fucked up.
- That what you wanna do?

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.500
- Yeah.
- You wanna get fucked up?

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.164
Let's go get fucked up.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.680
Shit. It looks like I pissed myself.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.442
- Get me out of here.
- Let me out.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.601
Shit!

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.004
I fell over.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.001
Hey, wait up.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.201
What?

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.300
- I ain't going in there.
- Come on, sweetheart. Come on.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.402
Come on. Let's get fucked up.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:57.806
I ain't going nowhere.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.608
What the fuck you doing here,
you little peckerwood?

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:28.300
Well, Travis here is out of sorts.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.820
And we figured you might have
something to help him unwind,

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.460
and us, too, naturally.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.547
What are you boys after anyway?

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:39.446
- Quaaludes.
- We can manage that.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.807
All right, give him 10 bucks.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.728
Get these boys their goods.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.606
Fetch that chicken. It's getting cold.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.409
Come here.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.001
Here.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.180
Take her a couple pieces.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.362
She's bound to want to
eat something by now.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.290
- You all got a girl back there?
- Should let him take it.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:26.011
I bet she'd like that.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.490
You might get all your problems
solved tonight, boy.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.405
Go get her, stud.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.980
Go get her.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.650
We'll wait.

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.285
Hello.

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.211
Stay out of this. None of your concern.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.001
It's wrong.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.090
I'm sorry?

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:08.700
- I said it's wrong what you've done to her.
- We ain't done a thing.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.580
She phones me up, doesn't she?

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:13.220
Says she wants to live up here,
sell pills for us.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.820
Of course, soon she's swallowing
more than she's selling.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.491
- Trying to cheat us. How much she owe us?
- 1,400.

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:24.530
Well, she's whittling it down,
one rut at a time.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.060
I can put the law on you.

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:32.507
Oh, is that your stick? Sheriff Spence?

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.291
Well, be my guest,
son, you can even tell him yourself.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:40.691
He'll be by after a while to get his cut,
just like every Saturday.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:47.843
Lord, son, don't you know
nothing about this world?

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.241
Now, get out.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.100
- Stop the car.
- What?

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.521
I said stop the goddamn car.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.001
Tra...

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.121
Wake up.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:15.721
Hey.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.287
No. No. Come on.

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.883
Come on.

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:43.325
Why'd you come back for me?

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.010
- 'Cause it's wrong what they did to you.
- It's what I get.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.220
What do we do now?

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.367
I don't know.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.900
To be honest,
I didn't figure us to get this far.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.126
Leonard will know.

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.720
- He always knows.
- No, I ain't going back to him.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.365
He's a Candler, his people.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.326
Wait a minute.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.887
You and all this damn history.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.420
You only want to live in the past
'cause all the books have been written,

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.660
so you know what to think of it.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.091
The world don't work like that.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.370
It never will.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:27.260
Sure ain't going to fix
what's missing in your life now.

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.486
This is kin.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.921
Travis.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.649
Leonard is your kin.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.449
Your real kin.

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.561
Where the hell have you been?
Lori called for ya.

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.171
What happened?

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.370
Toomeys had her.

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.849
You won't believe what they've done.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.420
You gotta go, both of you, right now.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:15.140
- Where are we gonna go?
- The Laurel.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.180
You got kin there.
Tell 'em your name, they'll take you in.

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.965
I'll come, I'll meet you there
just as soon as I settle things.

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.320
Then we'll decide what to do next.
Go on, get your stuff. Go on.

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.850
Come on, let's go.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.250
What are you gonna do?

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.729
I'm gonna try and square things.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.089
Make sure nobody gets hurt.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.809
- This is my mess. I oughta stay.
- Too late for that.

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.761
Come on.

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.651
"June 17, 1863.

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.009
"Clinch River, Tennessee.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.530
"Joshua Candler. Shot in lower bowel.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.851
"Much pain as God is just.

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.370
"Refuse anodynes.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.646
"Want clear mind to pray for soul,

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.643
"ask forgiveness for what
cannot be hidden from my maker.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.042
"In articulo mortis."

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.247
Carlton.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.740
What brings you around?

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.205
Oh, I think you know.

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.561
- Where the fuck they at, egghead?
- They're not important.

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:34.380
We can settle this amongst ourselves.

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.845
Oh, is that right?

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.620
Well, I got me a car down
at Reeves Grocery.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.563
No keys. You got those?

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.700
Tires on my truck slashed.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.484
You going to mend them for me?

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.723
My crop is destroyed.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.540
I'll give you 500 for the tires
and for the trouble of having to replant.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.130
That's your figure?

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.380
I'll throw in the dogs.
They're worth at least 1,000.

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.404
Those dogs are worthless.
You took all the fire out of them.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:14.722
The Winchester, it'll fetch 300.

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:20.287
And that fancy pistol of yours.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.002
It's a sweet little fucking piece.

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.368
I've had it a long time.

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.460
I almost forgot.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:54.962
See, I reckon we're entitled
to a little bonus.

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.725
For time wasted.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.924
Your money.

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.926
Where is it?

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.290
Over there in that cinder block.

01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:23.947
Is that where you keep your cash?

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.565
Oh, Professor.

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.180
I ain't got much truck
with banks neither,

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.204
but that's damn near
the sorriest thing I ever seen.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.689
Next order of business. Where's Dena?

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.410
You don't own her, Carlton.

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:47.820
Oh, see, I believe that I do,
body and soul,

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.844
until she pays back
what she took from me.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.684
She may be out of here,

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.886
but that boy ain't. Got nowhere to go.

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.211
And I'm gonna make it my business
to find him.

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:11.050
And when I do,
I'm gonna take what's owed me.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:13.740
You can be sure of that.

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.402
Now, what's it gonna be,
Dena or the boy?

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.003
Hey, hey.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.291
I'd stay out of this if I was you.

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.841
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:55.460
What are you doing?

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.740
It was always gonna end
this way for her.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.127
Different people,
different place is all.

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:02.961
Shit.

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.844
- Oh...
- What are you doing?

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.500
You will not make things easy
on yourself, will you, son?

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.140
Shut your goddamn mouth.

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:13.020
You little prick.

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:16.140
If it had been up to me,
we'd have killed you a long time ago.

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:19.210
I'll be damned if I'm not coming around
to that way of thinking, son.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.322
A nit makes a louse.
Ain't that right, Professor?

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.890
Travis, stop.

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.961
How come you never told me
you was a Candler?

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:45.163
That why you wanted to help me so bad?

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.089
To square what your kin done?

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.161
My daddy said the Candlers
tried to wipe the Sheltons out.

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:56.370
More like you was our
nemesis or something.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.211
- It's 100 years ago.
- Bullshit.

01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:02.460
Time don't pass. It's just layers.
It's all still happening.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.005
You said that.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:07.087
Come on, you said that yourself.

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.288
Oh, shit! I trusted you.

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:14.204
I trusted you, and you never
told me one lick of truth.

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.166
Listen to me now.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.123
I could have let you go, but I didn't.

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:28.364
Now here we are.

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.207
- Best give that to me.
- Oh, that will do.

01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:52.041
He won't do nothing. Never has.

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:58.611
It's no small thing to kill a man, not for
a refined sort of fellow such as him.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.881
I'm getting pretty tired
of your voice, Carlton.

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.961
Find a phone. Call highway patrol.

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.043
Not Spence. Highway patrol.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.489
Tell 'em to get up here.

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.140
Take her to the bus station,
put her on a bus.

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.969
Doesn't matter where.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.325
What about you?

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.446
I'll be all right.

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.046
Go on.

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.285
I'm sorry.

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.761
That's gonna cost you, Shuler.

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:04.927
Maybe.

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.140
So they wouldn't take you?

01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:11.403
I suppose even the US Army's
got to have some standards.

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:15.210
- No.
- You give a rifle to an imbecile?

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.130
You're no better than the Viet Cong.

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:21.180
- If you weren't holding that gun right there...
- He's baiting you, boy.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:23.300
- I'd whip your sorry ass, motherfucker.
- Don't pay him any mind.

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.420
- What?
- You heard me.

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:25.740
Oh, you think you can take it from me?

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.411
- Yeah, you goddamn right.
- How about I make it fair?

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.965
How about now?

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.007
- How about now?
- Don't.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.161
Don't.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.606
You idiot!

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:01.848
Can't you see the son of a bitch
wants you to kill him?

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.060
I'd let him too,

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.606
you condescending piece of shit.

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.500
Where's that slut going?

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:15.700
It's either the bus station
or the train down to Nashville.

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.290
I just want to know which.

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.660
Put him in the truck.

01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:21.410
How about I put one in his fucking ear?

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.488
How about you do what I tell you?

01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.688
Shit! Pissant!

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.208
- You get it?
- Yeah.

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.728
You know what,

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:05.446
this is the address
where I'll be staying.

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.166
You could give it to Leonard.

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:12.400
- Right.
- Just in case, I guess. I don't know.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.260
- Okay, let's go.
- Are you driving?

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:24.580
- She's driving. I'm napping.
- Sweet.

01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:25.681
Me too.

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:28.249
We're almost there, almost there.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.923
Would you slow down?

01:48:34.063 --> 01:48:37.609
Things ain't working out quite
like you planned it, Professor?

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.448
Don't you worry. It's nearly over.

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.660
Go before they catch us.

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:46.125
Yeah, let's go.

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:47.926
Look out!

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.526
- Let's go.
- Hit it! Make it an eight-hour drive.

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.501
...parked.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.164
Shit! You ain't doing much better
than I am, are you, Professor?

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.488
You gotta get me out of here.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.900
You get me out of this one,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.331
I'll leave 'em alone.

01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:47.531
Both of 'em.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.204
Shuler?

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:07.884
Just as I am

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.044
without one plea

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.364
Toomey was wrong.

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.530
Killing is easy.

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:30.322
Or at least easier than a whole
lot of other things in life.

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.201
Easier than love or happiness.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.889
Or making money.

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.969
Or raising a child.

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:51.849
So easy, you could do it with no more than
one finger pressed in a small metal curve.

01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:59.242
Or even by doing nothing at all.

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:06.926
Just being there and letting it happen.

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.242
The passive voice.

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:52.124
All right, son, now what just happened?

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.128
I just saw it. I was just driving by.

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.406
Where was this?

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:01.489
Route 25. Just past Panther Creek Road.

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.603
Did you stop?
Did you see anyone get hurt?

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:06.650
Did anyone get hurt?

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:09.806
No, I didn't. I just...

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.084
It looks pretty bad.

01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.365
They...
