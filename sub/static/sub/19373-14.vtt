00:52.753 --> 00:54.868
Okay, Ryder,
I'll deliver those treats

00:54.924 --> 00:57.753
to the lookout in just
two wags of a pup's tail.

00:57.878 --> 01:01.174
Thanks, Mr. Porter, but I think
it'll take you longer than that

01:01.223 --> 01:03.870
just to start up
your delivery van.

01:04.203 --> 01:05.909
My van?
(laughing)

01:05.988 --> 01:10.034
That's too old-school
for this modern-day grocery.

01:10.652 --> 01:13.223
This is the first day
my flying drones

01:13.299 --> 01:15.497
are delivering
Porter's fine foods

01:15.528 --> 01:18.189
to everyone in Adventure Bay.

01:20.036 --> 01:24.903
Drones? That sounds pretty cool.
But did you test them out first?

01:24.989 --> 01:28.505
<i>No need! They're new, so you
know they work great.</i>

01:28.591 --> 01:31.341
<i>Just open your door and
it'll be there in a jiff.</i>

01:31.505 --> 01:32.848
Well, okay.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.091
Ah! There's a big bug
chasing me!

01:36.286 --> 01:39.083
Wow! It's already here,
Mr. Porter.

01:39.153 --> 01:41.130
Talk about fast food!

01:41.208 --> 01:45.645
Thanks, Ryder. Drone delivery
is the wave of the future.

01:48.597 --> 01:51.286
So, the bug was
really a drone, huh?

01:51.426 --> 01:54.380
Carrying treats
that looked really yummy.

01:54.434 --> 01:55.981
(Skye:)
Flying food!

01:56.090 --> 01:57.676
(Rocky:)
Flying food!

01:57.739 --> 01:59.051
(pups munching)

01:59.137 --> 02:01.270
(chuckling)
Here you go, buddy.

02:01.372 --> 02:03.661
Mmm, that's a good bug.

02:03.770 --> 02:06.741
(all laughing)

02:09.954 --> 02:11.540
(clucking)

02:11.565 --> 02:14.025
Oh! Easy now, Chickaletta.

02:14.119 --> 02:17.228
I know Mr. Porters fabulous
flying food service

02:17.298 --> 02:20.257
is Adventure Bay's
latest craze, but...

02:20.930 --> 02:22.384
Oooooooooh! Ooh!

02:22.564 --> 02:26.595
Is that my air-delivered
bayberry cream pie?

02:26.853 --> 02:27.860
Oh, yes!

02:27.892 --> 02:28.955
(clucking)

02:29.023 --> 02:32.166
Pie, pie, pie! oh!

02:33.572 --> 02:35.338
Thanks, little drone,

02:35.447 --> 02:38.840
Mechanical deliverer of goodies.

02:40.540 --> 02:43.540
Oh, it's such
a sweltering sunny day.

02:43.658 --> 02:46.926
This sweaty seafarer could
certainly use a...

02:47.282 --> 02:51.618
An ice cream cone?
Oh, and squid jerky?

02:53.055 --> 02:56.610
Yum!
Squid ice cream!

02:56.818 --> 02:58.532
(barking)

02:59.430 --> 03:04.444
Yes, yes, I saved some fishy
freshness for you, too, wally.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.045
(barking)

03:08.532 --> 03:10.337
Your order just left, Raymundo.

03:10.407 --> 03:13.516
Tell your monkeys to keep their
eyes peeled for flying bananas.

03:13.618 --> 03:15.165
(phone ringing)
Hello.

03:15.193 --> 03:19.173
More french toast, francois?
Tout suite. Ha-ha!

03:19.273 --> 03:21.040
Oops. Wah!

03:21.657 --> 03:23.196
(phone ringing)
Hello. Um.

03:23.292 --> 03:25.915
Just a moment, please.
I dropped my remote control.

03:25.940 --> 03:26.727
What?

03:26.752 --> 03:29.641
No! Come back with
my remote control!

03:29.713 --> 03:32.613
(gasping)

03:34.136 --> 03:37.726
Uh-oh. Where's
my remote control?

(Boy:) Yay! Pizza!

03:58.875 --> 03:59.975
Thanks!

04:00.014 --> 04:02.342
Tuna's my favorite.

04:04.004 --> 04:05.249
Huh?

04:05.857 --> 04:08.288
It's too soon for dessert.

04:09.187 --> 04:13.264
Mr. Porter.
Chickaletta isn't that hungry.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.147
Call off your delivery drones.

04:15.349 --> 04:18.046
Sorry, Mayor goodway, but I've
lost control of them.

04:18.137 --> 04:20.702
We need the Paw Patrol.

04:20.889 --> 04:23.913
<i>And a drone flew away
with my remote control.</i>

04:24.038 --> 04:26.725
<i>Now, it's raining food
everywhere.</i>

04:26.882 --> 04:28.465
Don't worry, Mr. Porter.

04:28.614 --> 04:31.676
No job is too messy,
no pup is too small.

04:32.293 --> 04:35.114
Paw Patrol to the air Patroller!

04:35.207 --> 04:37.653
(All:)
Ryder needs us!

04:38.429 --> 04:39.863
Oh, no.

04:39.981 --> 04:41.390
(barking)
Whoa, whoa!

04:41.453 --> 04:43.921
(all shouting at once)
Whoa!

04:44.102 --> 04:45.522
(pups grunting)

04:48.522 --> 04:51.756
Wow, that banana split.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.436
(all laughing)

05:02.323 --> 05:05.361
Paw Patrol ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.479
Thanks, pups.

05:06.532 --> 05:09.557
We've got to stop a food
dropping air force.

05:09.638 --> 05:11.736
Mr. Porter's remote control is
missing

05:11.814 --> 05:15.455
and now he can't stop his drones
from dropping food everywhere.

05:15.557 --> 05:19.080
Sounds like a messy mission that
I won't mind cleaning up.

05:19.378 --> 05:20.487
Yum!

05:20.555 --> 05:22.830
It's up to the Paw Patrol
to protect Adventure Bay

05:22.924 --> 05:26.689
from raining food and find that
missing remote control.

05:26.783 --> 05:30.385
Okay, but those drones are
flying all over the place.

05:30.541 --> 05:32.705
That's why you pups will
need your flight packs

05:32.772 --> 05:33.838
to Chase them down.

05:33.908 --> 05:36.885
Rocky, you'll use your claw to
snag food in midair

05:36.964 --> 05:38.283
before it splats people.

05:38.377 --> 05:40.979
Green means go get
that falling food.

05:41.033 --> 05:42.557
(all laughing)

05:42.650 --> 05:44.650
Rubble, you'll ride
your hover board

05:44.721 --> 05:47.010
and use it to
swat away flying food.

05:47.113 --> 05:50.713
Rubble on the
double order of fries.

05:50.804 --> 05:52.366
(all laughing)

05:52.506 --> 05:54.663
Marshall,
you'll use your water cannons

05:54.741 --> 05:56.874
to wash away whatever
mess we miss.

05:57.031 --> 05:59.913
I'm all fried food up.
(laughing)

05:59.960 --> 06:03.530
Good one, Marshall.
That's the best food joke yet.

06:03.603 --> 06:06.553

07:25.831 --> 07:28.238
Way to catch that
flying food, pups.

07:28.355 --> 07:30.558
<i>Thanks, Ryder,
but there's too many drones</i>

07:30.621 --> 07:32.230
<i>And too much food to stop.</i>

07:32.301 --> 07:35.057
I know. We've going to track
down the missing remote,

07:35.168 --> 07:37.285
So we can take back
control of those drones,

07:37.394 --> 07:39.308
And I've got
an idea how to do it.

07:39.394 --> 07:40.894
- <i>Awesome.
- Yay!</i>

07:40.965 --> 07:44.332
Chase, go airborne and capture a
drone with your safety net.

07:44.478 --> 07:47.181
(barking)

Rocky, once Chase
catches a drone,

08:05.705 --> 08:08.221
Use your tools to activate
the homing function.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.994
Homing? What's that mean?

08:10.080 --> 08:12.721
<i>It's an electronic signal
that the drone can follow</i>

08:12.791 --> 08:15.518
<i>All the way back to

08:34.649 --> 08:35.946

now it's your turn.

08:52.145 --> 08:54.536
Follow that drone back
to the missing control.

I'm on its tail.

09:25.294 --> 09:29.499
Wow! This is
one wild drone Chase.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.947
(squealing)

09:34.936 --> 09:36.676
(beeping)

09:42.856 --> 09:44.684
I got the remote control!

09:44.817 --> 09:47.543
But the drone snatched
two of the piglets.

09:47.739 --> 09:50.259
(Ryder:) <i>See if you can make that
drone bring the flying piggies</i>

09:50.285 --> 09:51.569
<i>Safely back to earth.</i>

09:51.645 --> 09:52.726
Here goes.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.413
(powering down)

09:54.616 --> 09:56.655
Uh-oh. I think those piglets

09:56.718 --> 09:58.757
Played a little
too rough with this.

10:02.538 --> 10:03.621
(gasping)

10:03.716 --> 10:07.279
The broken remote control must
have turned off the drones.

10:07.833 --> 10:09.241
Ah!

10:10.460 --> 10:11.521
(bleating)

10:12.421 --> 10:14.155
(clucking)
Oh, yes!

10:14.241 --> 10:17.421
That's a very fine hat
for our chicken statue.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.358
<i>(clucking)</i>

10:23.611 --> 10:26.033
No! The piglets are
going to crash land

10:26.095 --> 10:28.033
right near Mr. Porter's
restaurant.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.204
Wait!

10:29.345 --> 10:32.353
That pool full of pies would be
the perfect landing pad.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.830
Chase, go over to Mr. Porter's.

10:34.923 --> 10:36.025
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

10:36.080 --> 10:37.650
On it, Ryder.

10:37.759 --> 10:39.900
Hit it.
<i>(barking)</i>

10:43.028 --> 10:44.440
Jets.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.529
Chase, go to Alex's pool.

10:52.599 --> 10:54.240
Sure thing.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.060
(pigs squealing)

10:57.138 --> 10:59.459
It'll be okay, little piggies!

10:59.575 --> 11:02.099
The Paw Patrol's here to help!

11:02.287 --> 11:04.576
Okay, now push the pool towards
me.

11:04.662 --> 11:07.416
(barking)
Turbo jets.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.201
(squealing)

11:09.513 --> 11:12.544
Okay, Chase, stop right here!

11:12.641 --> 11:15.185
(barking)
Jets off.

11:15.489 --> 11:16.732
Bingo!

11:16.791 --> 11:18.451
(squealing)

11:18.529 --> 11:19.576
(Rubble:)
Hurray!

11:19.620 --> 11:22.224
- Yay! Woo-hoo!
- Chase, you did it!

11:22.283 --> 11:23.826
Thanks, Paw Patrol.

11:23.896 --> 11:27.091
I think I'm going to go back to
my trusty old delivery van.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.255
No more drones for me.

11:29.372 --> 11:31.802
