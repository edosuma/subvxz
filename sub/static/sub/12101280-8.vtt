WEBVTT

00:24.232 --> 00:25.942
[thunder rumbling]

00:45.003 --> 00:46.046
Can you feel them?

00:47.547 --> 00:49.299
No heartbeats yet, sir.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.846
[whispering] How many markers
have we passed?

00:54.929 --> 00:56.264
[whispering] Five, ma'am.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.696
[volcra screeching in distance]

01:14.407 --> 01:15.950
[volcra growling]

01:17.744 --> 01:19.704
-They're coming.
-Yes.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.500
-I should just tear this down now.
-And what can you really do on your own?

01:31.341 --> 01:32.425
Besides,

01:33.301 --> 01:35.720
it would be a monumental waste of power.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.104
[volcra growling in distance]

01:45.730 --> 01:47.232
[Jesper grunts]

01:47.315 --> 01:49.901
This is a bad idea. [sniffs]

01:49.984 --> 01:52.320
-[Kaz] I think it's rather practical.
-[Jesper scoffs] What? Why?

01:52.403 --> 01:55.281
I don't see how we step off this boat
without you pulling those guns.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.700
-[chuckles]
-So, cleaning them is a good idea.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.703
I don't mean this. I mean this.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.497
[volcra growling]

02:02.580 --> 02:07.794
We are in the worst place in the world,
on a ship full of people who want us dead,

02:07.877 --> 02:10.046
surrounded by monsters
who want us in their gullets.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.923
-I should have brought Milo.
-Who's Milo?

02:12.882 --> 02:13.758
The goat.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.762
-How many bullets do you have?
-[growling continues]

02:18.555 --> 02:19.639
Not enough.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.820
I hate this place.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.909
Why isn't he giving Alina the go-ahead?

02:40.493 --> 02:44.080
-She has one job. This.
-Soon.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.334
Did the general tell you something?

02:48.418 --> 02:51.629
He told me to have you stop the skiff
before we reach the western docks.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.464
Why?

02:56.467 --> 02:58.177
To make sure there's an audience.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.529
[coins jingling]

03:18.281 --> 03:19.407
All clear.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.290
If we were in Fjerda,
my people would help.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.209
Help kill me, maybe.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.963
[sighs] I don't like it either,

03:34.047 --> 03:37.759
but can't have you
out on the streets in Ravka, now, can I?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.970
You are safe here in Arkesk.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.516
I will go north in the night.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.731
No. This can't be it.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.778
I'm not done tormenting you.

03:59.155 --> 04:01.491
I'm not going back to that whaler's hut.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.118
Well, then somewhere else?

04:05.912 --> 04:09.082
There must be a place
where we're not just Grisha and Drüskelle.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.629
Somewhere beyond Ravka? Beyond Fjerda?

04:15.588 --> 04:20.009
A place where
we're just Nina Zenik and Matthias Helvar.

04:21.761 --> 04:22.845
If I go…

04:24.097 --> 04:26.349
I could never go back to Fjerda.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.480
I would be court-martialed as a deserter.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.990
I'd be branded a traitor to all Grisha.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.202
I know.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.957
It's your whole life.
I can't take that away from you.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.753
But thank you for saving me.

04:57.839 --> 04:58.673
[Matthias] Hmm.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.766
You did the same for me.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.355
And if we stayed together,
I doubt it would be the last time.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.655
But I have only known
two countries my whole life.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.159
Yours and mine.

05:29.787 --> 05:30.997
What are the others like?

05:31.080 --> 05:35.209
Well, Kerch…
might be a bit much for you.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.962
On Ghezen's Day, it's customary
to ride through the streets naked

05:38.046 --> 05:39.714
and drunk on grapefruit wine.

05:39.797 --> 05:41.132
Not Kerch.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.094
Oh, the Wandering Isle.
Well, I can fit in there, no trouble.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.388
-Have you ever met anyone from there?
-Hmm.

05:47.972 --> 05:51.601
-They are infernally happy there.
-Yeah, you'll come to like being happy.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.439
You'll never have to grow
that damned Drüskelle beard.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.275
I mean…

06:00.693 --> 06:02.111
you're welcome to grow a beard,

06:02.195 --> 06:05.073
but only for the purposes
of keeping me warm.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.036
I will keep you warm.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.458
[stomach growling]

06:15.541 --> 06:17.085
[both laugh]

06:19.170 --> 06:20.254
Um…

06:21.380 --> 06:22.965
I may be hungry.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.302
There's a pub downstairs
that serves hot meals.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.598
Maybe they have waffles.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.600
What are waffles?

06:33.684 --> 06:37.396
I can't wait to introduce you
to my truest love.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.524
[indistinct chatter]

06:42.860 --> 06:46.322
Nah, I'm out of the merchant trade.
I hunt slavers now.

06:46.405 --> 06:49.242
[bartender] Even out here?
You're a long way from Ketterdam.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.453
[Kerch captain] They raised the bounty.
20,000 a head.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.957
As long as
the captive will testify in court.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.292
That's more than
a haul of Kaelish whiskey.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.919
-[bartender chuckles]
-My whole crew gets double pay.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.754
[footsteps approaching]

07:01.838 --> 07:02.964
[whispers] It's clear.

07:05.424 --> 07:06.384
Come on.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.765
-Is there meat in this?
-Mmm. No.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.685
Saints, you're a genius.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.813
Yeah. Infused with cured boar.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.065
[Matthias chuckles]

07:21.149 --> 07:23.317
Is this supposed to be sweet or savory?

07:23.401 --> 07:24.360
Yes.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.446
[both chuckle]

07:27.989 --> 07:29.657
[heart beating rapidly]

07:30.741 --> 07:31.576
Matthias?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.287
What? What is it?

07:34.829 --> 07:37.081
Matthias, what is it?
What's the matter, Matthias?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.082
What's the matter?

07:39.584 --> 07:42.211
[heart beating steadily]

07:46.674 --> 07:49.802
Dropped the blood flow to his head,
so he's out for a few minutes.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.971
Something you could
have done hours ago, right?

07:52.054 --> 07:53.097
Fedyor.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.225
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.562
We got report
of a Drüskelle ship taking Grisha north.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.189
So we're on a hunt.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.275
We spied you
with the Fjerdan and followed you here.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.819
My Squaller says he's one of Brum's men.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.947
Are there more nearby?
Is that why you haven't killed him?

08:10.031 --> 08:11.949
-He's with me.
-He's…

08:18.080 --> 08:19.207
[Fedyor sighs]

08:21.125 --> 08:23.628
Your heart is pounding.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.507
Is it for him?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.176
-For the enemy?
-He's changed.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.678
They don't change.

08:36.015 --> 08:36.974
[sighs]

08:39.018 --> 08:40.728
Bring him to the general with us,

08:41.771 --> 08:44.649
and I won't name you a traitor.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.276
He must die for his crimes.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.237
Nina.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.201
Slaver! This man is a slaver
who is taking me to be sold.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.579
-Will you testify in court?
-I'll testify, yes.

08:59.413 --> 09:00.831
Take me with you to Ketterdam.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.625
[Fedyor] He's not a slaver.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.627
He's Fjerdan and she's Grisha.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.255
Don't matter to me, a bounty's a bounty.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.381
[Fedyor] And we are taking him.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.052
-But you'll just kill him.
-So?

09:13.135 --> 09:16.597
Well, that's a waste of 20,000 kruge.

09:17.139 --> 09:17.974
So…

09:18.891 --> 09:20.810
[guns cocking]

09:27.275 --> 09:30.111
You're already at war
with Fjerda, Heartrender.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.948
You want a new one with my country?

09:34.615 --> 09:37.785
Is one man that important to you?

10:04.562 --> 10:05.438
Happy sailing.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.404
[volcra screeching]

10:23.706 --> 10:24.874
Do something.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.920
-No. Remember who's driving.
-[gasps]

10:41.349 --> 10:43.017
[people murmuring]

10:48.856 --> 10:51.108
[Kirigan] Your power is mine now.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.112
[woman] What's he doing?

10:56.614 --> 10:57.490
[man] What's going on?

10:58.532 --> 10:59.784
[rumbling]

11:05.414 --> 11:06.248
[Jesper] So?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.545
What's our play?

11:11.629 --> 11:12.755
We wait.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.965
For what?

11:17.635 --> 11:19.512
For whatever the general has planned.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.806
-You figured him out?
-Not quite.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.100
Consider the scenario.

11:24.725 --> 11:28.479
The Sun Summoner fled from his palace,
now she's tied to the deck.

11:28.562 --> 11:29.688
We're sailing for a city

11:29.772 --> 11:32.441
where another Ravkan general
hired Arken to kill her.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.654
And I saw his face as he boarded.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.573
I know that look.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.410
He's a man consumed with vengeance.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.954
See it enough in the mirror, do you?

11:47.123 --> 11:48.249
So?

11:49.750 --> 11:52.586
What kind of revenge
is he planning, exactly?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.381
[Kaz] We know
it requires the Sun Summoner,

11:55.464 --> 11:57.299
which makes her valuable to us.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.136
She's the one
keeping everyone safe in here.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.471
If we have control of her,
then we call the shots.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.975
-We need to threaten her life.
-[both] What?

12:07.435 --> 12:08.269
[Jesper] Who's this?

12:09.937 --> 12:11.814
-Who are you?
-[Inej] A stowaway.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.608
Why pick this of all skiffs?

12:17.194 --> 12:19.488
To kill the general and save Alina.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.491
-I'll ask again.
-[gun cocking]

12:23.242 --> 12:24.326
Who are you?

12:25.119 --> 12:25.953
Mal Oretsev.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.588
-[Kaz] You know Alina?
-I do.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.133
-Who's in control of her?
-The general I'm going to kill.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.301
[Kaz] Inej, give him his gun.

12:41.135 --> 12:41.969
Why?

12:42.052 --> 12:44.805
Because if he isn't with Kirigan's crew,
he's with ours.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.190
[scraping]

13:00.321 --> 13:01.614
[Alina] Why this half measure?

13:02.573 --> 13:04.116
Why just carve a tunnel?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.494
You have me. You have this.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.246
Destroy the Fold. You said we could.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.916
And why would we destroy the Fold?

13:13.375 --> 13:15.377
It's the greatest weapon that we've got.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.313
See? The sun girl is not so useless.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.233
Whatever gets us to Novokribirsk.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.111
As soon as we land,
I'm going straight to see my aunt.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.614
You have family there?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.743
Yes. My family's Ravkan.

13:47.826 --> 13:50.579
That's why I volunteer
to drive the skiffs. To see them.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.669
[Ostap] Sir, your thoughts?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.088
[Zlatan] Lead with diplomacy.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.507
We welcome
the Black General and his escort.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.800
But when they're docked,

14:03.300 --> 14:05.886
when they're close,
kill everyone on the skiff.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.347
But the power on display here,

14:08.889 --> 14:10.599
it means they have the Sun Queen.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.728
-Are you giving the order to kill her too?
-I already did.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.106
But Arken failed me,
so we'll do it ourselves.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.986
Sir, she could destroy the Fold.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.154
Then she is a threat to our independence.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.128
Why have we stopped?

14:41.630 --> 14:43.257
-What's he doing?
-Shh.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.051
One more demonstration.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.389
You've seen what the Sun Summoner can do.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.227
Now bear witness to what I can do…

14:56.478 --> 14:57.855
with her power.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.028
Whatever it is you want me to do,
I won't do it.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.237
[Kirigan] You've done your part.

15:07.781 --> 15:08.782
Now I shall do mine.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.333
[air whooshing]

15:18.584 --> 15:19.877
[rumbling]

15:21.712 --> 15:24.048
-[indistinct chatter]
-Retreat.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.384
Retreat! Retreat!

15:32.097 --> 15:34.391
What have you done? [gasps]

15:35.726 --> 15:37.353
[power surging]

15:46.111 --> 15:47.279
No, you don't.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.405
[Alina grunts]

15:48.906 --> 15:50.449
[people screaming]

15:54.495 --> 15:55.829
[panting]

15:56.413 --> 15:59.416
They are traitors who tried to kill you.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.086
This is retribution.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.295
[Alina grunts]

16:03.379 --> 16:04.588
[gasps]

16:13.889 --> 16:15.474
[people screaming in distance]

16:15.557 --> 16:16.600
What now?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.811
We wait.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.522
Kaz, you can hear him slaughtering a city.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.316
So you understand
the scale of his power, then? Good.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.027
The bold move is to strike now.

16:27.111 --> 16:30.155
And the smart one
is to get clear of the damned Fold first.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.410
I never said I was smart.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.954
[knife clatters]

16:37.037 --> 16:39.248
-Can you believe him?
-[Inej] I'm going with him.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.589
Today, we redraw all the maps.

16:48.757 --> 16:53.846
With the power of the Sun Summoner
at my command, I control the Fold.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.723
And its monsters.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.225
I can move it to any border I like.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.602
Engulf any harbor.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.522
Consume any city.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.818
Take what you have seen
back to your home countries.

17:07.901 --> 17:08.902
Tell the Fjerdans.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.697
-Tell the Shu Han.
-[panting]

17:12.364 --> 17:16.869
There will be no more war with Ravka.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.289
All countries will answer to us.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.375
For who would oppose us now?

17:26.211 --> 17:27.296
-[gunshot]
-Mal!

17:35.721 --> 17:37.473
[whooshing]

17:38.474 --> 17:39.683
[grunts]

17:42.061 --> 17:43.687
[panting] Mal.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.899
[Kirigan] Keep him alive.
He could be useful to us.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.442
[Mal grunting] Alina.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.032
[Kirigan] Focus.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.579
You put your attention
on the light that's keeping us all safe,

18:00.662 --> 18:02.748
or your friend dies now.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.379
[power surging]

18:18.889 --> 18:19.723
[grunts]

18:19.807 --> 18:21.558
[Alina crying]

18:29.399 --> 18:31.276
-We wait!
-The action's up there.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.238
-They have the advantage.
-Only because I'm not in the game.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.412
-[wind gusting]
-Zoya, what are you doing?

18:42.496 --> 18:43.747
The general wants us to stay put.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.374
Get us out of here. Now!

18:46.750 --> 18:49.044
[grunting]

18:50.587 --> 18:51.922
[groans]

18:52.005 --> 18:54.424
Do you think I need
special power to end your life, Wraith?

18:56.969 --> 18:58.178
[Alina whimpering] Mal…

18:58.262 --> 18:59.721
[heart beating loudly]

19:02.349 --> 19:05.978
General Kirigan, this will only turn
the world against you and all Grisha.

19:06.061 --> 19:09.690
You'll be seen not as a savior,
but a heretic.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.777
[guns cocking]

19:14.862 --> 19:17.239
-No!
-[people groaning]

19:20.784 --> 19:21.618
Shame.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.998
I'll have to give that speech again now.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.209
[Inej and Feliks grunting]

19:38.635 --> 19:40.137
[grunting]

19:47.728 --> 19:49.479
[heart beating rapidly]

19:51.523 --> 19:53.233
[heartbeat slowing]

19:53.317 --> 19:55.444
[wind gusting]

19:59.865 --> 20:00.949
Help me stop him.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.872
[wind gusting]

20:06.955 --> 20:07.998
[groaning]

20:08.081 --> 20:08.999
[screams]

20:12.294 --> 20:13.295
[Kirigan] Zoya?

20:16.548 --> 20:17.966
Zoya!

20:21.011 --> 20:22.596
-[gunshot]

[crackling]

20:39.238 --> 20:40.239
[groans]

20:49.581 --> 20:51.959
It will take more than this!

21:09.768 --> 21:11.270
You stay in the dark.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.563
[volcra growling]

21:15.148 --> 21:16.358
[groans]

21:27.244 --> 21:28.453
Zoya. Zoya.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.080

[growling]

22:03.405 --> 22:04.865
[panting]

22:56.666 --> 22:58.085
It's just you and me now, Alina.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.881
And we are all we need, anyway.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.473
[Alina] You may have needed me…

23:12.724 --> 23:14.142
but I never needed you.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.477
[blade swishes]

23:27.572 --> 23:30.867
Your first words to me were,
"What are you?"

23:31.910 --> 23:34.371
This is what I am.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.879
[volcra shrieking]

23:49.302 --> 23:50.971
How do you claim such power?

23:52.639 --> 23:54.432
-I am the one who killed the Stag.
-[grunting]

23:54.516 --> 23:57.185
I didn't understand before, but I do now.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.855
You cannot claim
what was not given to you.

24:00.355 --> 24:02.357
The Stag chose me.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.609
[power surging]

24:09.322 --> 24:12.617
You chose to betray our people.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.079
I was trying to save us.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.208
[grunts]

24:21.084 --> 24:22.502
No! [panting]

24:22.586 --> 24:23.587
Mal!

24:23.670 --> 24:25.338
[both panting]

24:27.257 --> 24:28.633
[Mal] You betrayed us first.

24:37.225 --> 24:39.603
[both grunting]

24:39.686 --> 24:40.687
[groaning]

24:52.199 --> 24:53.825
-How dare you?
-[groaning]

24:56.494 --> 24:58.079
He gave you everything.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.417
-[chokes]
-Remember your place.

25:05.712 --> 25:06.922
[grunts]

25:07.505 --> 25:09.299
[grunting]

25:09.382 --> 25:10.550
[groaning]

25:14.012 --> 25:15.180
[grunts]

25:19.309 --> 25:21.019
Still couldn't shoot the pretty face.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.312
I've got to stop doing that.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.773
[both grunting]

25:51.758 --> 25:53.510
[volcra growling]

25:54.511 --> 25:55.929
I recommend we get moving.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.313
-[blade swishes]
-[Mal grunts]

26:06.022 --> 26:07.774
[grunting]

26:27.502 --> 26:29.713
I've survived for centuries.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.383
Did you really think you could kill me?

26:34.259 --> 26:35.802
I don't have to kill you, Darkling.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.513
Your past will do it for me.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.598
[volcra shrieking]

26:47.522 --> 26:48.440
[Mal] What happened?

26:48.940 --> 26:50.442
[Inej] It's Kirigan's Heartrender.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.781
[Mal] Come on, Alina.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.327
Alina, come back for me, please. Alina?

27:01.578 --> 27:02.662
[crying] Please wake up.

27:03.788 --> 27:04.873
Please come back.

27:06.041 --> 27:06.958
Please.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.711
[growling]

27:14.049 --> 27:17.218
-[Mal] Come on, please.
-[gasps] Mal…

27:19.637 --> 27:21.389
[sobs] I'm here.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.311
Don't you dare say,
"Meet me in the meadow."

27:27.979 --> 27:29.856
[volcra growling]

28:11.731 --> 28:13.358
I've never met a Saint before.

28:14.442 --> 28:16.152
I've never been a Saint before.

28:19.864 --> 28:22.534
Wherever you are, whatever you need…

28:24.577 --> 28:26.329
my hand is yours.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.666
I like that hand with a dagger in it.

28:31.084 --> 28:34.421
I couldn't hold onto yours,
so take mine as a replacement.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.632
It's not much,
but it'll fend off a bully or two.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.593
[chuckles]

28:42.720 --> 28:44.097
I know just what to name it.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.311
[Jesper] Step one for any good plan,

28:50.895 --> 28:51.896
a change of clothes.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.649
It's worked for me.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.567
Here.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.110
[Mal] Thank you.

28:58.903 --> 29:02.073
So… will you still be
trying to kidnap me?

29:04.200 --> 29:05.285
'Course not.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.163
Have you found religion, too?

29:08.246 --> 29:09.873
No, it's just… [sighs]

29:09.956 --> 29:11.916
I'm exhausted. Besides…

29:12.834 --> 29:15.462
it'd be bad form to kidnap someone
after they saved your life.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.257
You are quite valuable, you know?

29:31.019 --> 29:32.270
So is this.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.906
I saw this on a portrait
of one of the queens in the Little Palace.

29:42.989 --> 29:43.990
[Alina] It's not a gift.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.825
It's to keep quiet about who I am.

29:46.534 --> 29:47.911
Where I go from here.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.549
The deal is the deal.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.795
I didn't expect it to burn at all.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.884
But it can be destroyed in the end.

30:46.719 --> 30:47.887
Just like him.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.115
I know that look.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.453
You're staring down your new bully.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.164
We're worse off than we were before, Mal.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.378
Kirigan turned on his own people--

31:20.461 --> 31:21.421
Okay.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.552
You're not ready yet.

31:28.887 --> 31:29.804
Neither were they.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.431
That's not your fault.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.183
Who do you think the world will blame?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.440
We'll come back, I promise.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.485
You will tear it down.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.070
Just not today.

31:48.907 --> 31:49.991
I have to go.

31:50.491 --> 31:51.367
Wait!

31:52.535 --> 31:54.495
You can't go back into the Fold.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.831
To Novokribirsk.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.626
I had family in that city.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.712
I need to know how much of it is lost.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.923
It's dangerous to go looking for the dead.

32:05.965 --> 32:08.593
What you see
may haunt you for the rest of your days.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.765
Not going will haunt me more.

32:17.852 --> 32:19.270
You can't stay in Ravka.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.981
The Apparat will try to keep his power.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.524
Blame this on all of us.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.693
The people will turn on Grisha again.

32:26.527 --> 32:27.904
You need to find new allies.

32:35.578 --> 32:36.996
Then I'll come back…

32:38.164 --> 32:39.707
and reclaim our country.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.921
I still don't like you…

32:46.005 --> 32:48.758
but I'm grateful for you.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.636
So remember this.

32:52.345 --> 32:55.807
Saints become martyrs
before they get to be heroes.

32:56.849 --> 32:57.684
So…

32:59.352 --> 33:00.478
stay alive.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.272
They'll have to get through me first.

33:03.773 --> 33:07.944
You need more than bullets and bravado
to survive the people hunting you now.

33:22.291 --> 33:25.211
[Kaz] It's a two-day walk to Os Kervo
from here, given our condition.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.671
[Jesper sighs] Two days as the crow walks.

33:26.754 --> 33:29.173
We can smuggle ourselves
onto a ship to Ketterdam from there.

33:35.304 --> 33:38.558
[Inej] You berated me for letting her go,
and now that's what you're doing.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.935
So what's your angle?

33:41.978 --> 33:43.604
I'm keeping my promise to you.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.442
I swore
you won't go back to the Menagerie,

33:47.525 --> 33:49.569
and one of these gemstones covers it.

33:51.237 --> 33:52.905
She needs my help more than you.

33:52.989 --> 33:53.990
But we do need you.

33:57.326 --> 33:58.494
I need you.

34:05.626 --> 34:09.505
I want to see the look
on Heleen's face when you clear the books.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.217
After that…

34:14.719 --> 34:15.720
we'll see.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.071
Matthias?

34:33.154 --> 34:34.864
Matthias. Matthias.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.632
-[groaning]
-[dishes clattering]

34:54.092 --> 34:55.384
Devil Drüsje.

34:55.468 --> 34:58.638
No. No, Matthias, please. [groans]

34:59.388 --> 35:00.973
[heart beating rapidly]

35:01.057 --> 35:02.433
[panting]

35:04.352 --> 35:07.105
-I'm sorry.
-[groaning]

35:07.188 --> 35:08.439
Matthias?

35:08.523 --> 35:12.777
-[heart beating steadily]
-This was… just a cruel joke all along.

35:13.402 --> 35:16.197
To prove a point.
To treat me as I treated you.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.574
No. This was to save your life.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.535
They would have killed you.

35:21.035 --> 35:23.955
It was falling on the mercy
of Kerch law, or certain death.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.375
I knew if I said you were a slaver,
they would only arrest you.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.584
I am no slaver.

35:28.668 --> 35:31.170
I know, I'll drop the charge
when the case goes to court.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.340
[laughs] "Goes to court"?
Maybe in a year or two.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.135
Meantime, we're headed to Hellgate.

35:37.635 --> 35:42.390
All that awaits us is a dank,
stone cell where we'll rot. [laughing]

35:42.473 --> 35:43.474
[guard] Time's up!

35:45.017 --> 35:47.311
Trust me, please.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.814
You broke my trust.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.315
No, I can fix this.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.901
You cannot fix this.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.863
-[guard] Get up. Time's up. Up you come.
-Matthias, please.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.538
[sighs]

36:07.832 --> 36:11.335
Os Kervo! Docked at Os Kervo!

36:11.419 --> 36:13.337
On to Ketterdam next!

36:17.008 --> 36:18.634
[Jesper] We set out with a clear mission,

36:19.260 --> 36:21.888
a prize of a million kruge.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.808
And a new member on our crew. So…

36:25.892 --> 36:26.767
[grunts]

36:27.602 --> 36:28.769
what did we learn?

36:29.645 --> 36:31.189
People with trains are evil.

36:31.939 --> 36:34.358
You can't kidnap a human sunbeam.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.861
And maybe, just maybe,

36:37.612 --> 36:40.406
greed is a poor motivator.

36:41.073 --> 36:44.285
True wealth is the friends
you make along the way.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.703
I just might be impressed.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.705
I'm talking of Milo, of course.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.710
But I won't have my smelly friend
when walking into Ketterdam.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.463
Where Dreesen is waiting for our return.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.174
And Pekka Rollins.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.928
They'll both want our heads
once we show up without the Sun Summoner.

37:02.011 --> 37:03.512
Well, I'm sure the boss has a plan.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.891
[laughing] He wouldn't
send us into a death trap.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.477
Tell me you have a plan.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.687
I don't care if it's a lie.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.023
I have a plan.

37:15.358 --> 37:18.569
And, just how this all started…

37:19.862 --> 37:21.572
we're going to need a Heartrender.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.157
[Jesper] Milana?

37:23.241 --> 37:26.786
[Kaz] No. For this to work,
it has to be someone neither of them know.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.538
Someone desperate for work,
with loyalties only to us.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.916
[man 1] It'll be a long passage
without that wine shipment.

37:31.999 --> 37:34.502
[man 2] Have a heart.
Novokribirsk is in ruins.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.087
Their Sun Saint is dead.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.549
Excuse me. Is what he said true?

37:41.676 --> 37:43.052
I don't know if she's dead.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.720
But she is a Saint.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.980
[sailor speaks Kerch]

37:55.773 --> 37:57.400
Did he call us ghosts?

37:58.567 --> 38:00.236
It also means survivors.

38:05.032 --> 38:08.286
But ghosts
are what we'll need to be for a while.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.373
Zoya's right.
The whole world will be after you.

38:17.545 --> 38:20.256
I know some people
in this world who'd like those odds.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.140
[Alina] It's you and me now,
like old times.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.475
[Mal] I like those odds, too.

38:39.775 --> 38:44.488
[Alina] And when I'm strong enough,
we'll come back. Together.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.074
And tear it down…

38:48.326 --> 38:50.119
now that the Darkling is dead.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.172
[gasps]

39:03.799 --> 39:05.176
[grunting]

39:22.318 --> 39:23.402
Follow.
