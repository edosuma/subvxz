An ax murderer
with blood dripping

00:30.800 --> 00:33.160
from her
grizzly weapon...

00:33.160 --> 00:36.120
Or a mummy wrapped
in rotten bandages.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.160
What about
a razor-sharp hook

00:38.160 --> 00:40.320
where her hand
should be?

00:40.320 --> 00:41.480
No, no.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.680
A zombie
with sunken eyes

00:43.680 --> 00:46.440
and all
stifflike.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.280
Sounds like
Kristen's up tonight.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.080
We're trying
to guess what act

00:50.080 --> 00:51.720
she's going
to pull to scare us.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.400
I liked it
when she dressed up

00:53.400 --> 00:54.800
as the prom queen.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.560
Whatever it is,
i hope she gets here soon.

Hey, where did
you get that stuff?

01:09.040 --> 01:10.440
Up in the attic.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.280
I, uh,
think my parents

01:12.280 --> 01:14.920
were old hippies
or something.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.880
Here.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.480
Groovy, man.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.480
And... here.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.320
Whoa! Sock it to me.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.960
What's this got to do
with your story?

01:28.960 --> 01:31.480
There's an old saying
that goes,

01:31.480 --> 01:34.320
if you don't learn
from the past,

01:34.320 --> 01:37.640
you'll be doomed
to repeat it.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.600
My story's
a little different.

01:42.280 --> 01:46.000
In my tale, if you don't
learn from the present,

01:46.000 --> 01:49.320
you'll repeat the past...

01:49.320 --> 01:53.440

It's kind of far
from things.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.640
Are you complaining?

02:47.640 --> 02:48.680
No.

02:48.680 --> 02:49.960
Look, I've been here

02:49.960 --> 02:53.200
far too long to take
grief from a transfer

02:53.200 --> 02:54.200

5 minutes.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.800
And hold your finger
on the end

03:31.800 --> 03:33.920
so that it doesn't run out.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.560
Simple.

Don't do that.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.280

with things

my old school.

Oh. Where
are you from?

your next class?

to get there?

think of the new girl?

05:36.280 --> 05:37.520
Kind of weird,

in chemistry?

Well...

05:43.640 --> 05:46.360
She had
this straw thing

05:46.360 --> 05:49.560

the water...

05:49.560 --> 05:52.360
Yeah. Then what?

Well, then she
sort of did this.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.680
about giving me grief,
Miss Dufaux?

06:26.680 --> 06:27.840
But, sir, I didn't--

a troublemaker,

what happened

not to laugh?

this sounds crazy,

I saw a ghost.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.880
What's the matter?

08:50.880 --> 08:52.480
I trusted you, and you had to
tell everybody what I told you.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.440
Julie, I didn't--

08:54.440 --> 08:56.040

jerks in the cafeteria,

to be nice.</i>

I should have
seen you coming.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.080
Julie, I only told
one person.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.080
I didn't know they were
going to make it news.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.480
Well, they did.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.920
Now everybody thinks I'm
the crazy new foreign kid.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920

for a reason, OK?

got a good laugh.

to scare you,

I didn't think

09:35.480 --> 09:36.920
anything
could scare you.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.360
That's because
you're a ghostbuster.

to the same person.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.320
Groovy. I'll meet you
in the lab.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.840
Groovy?

14:49.840 --> 14:52.000
Something strange
happened, Chris.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.680
Yeah. Tell me
about it.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.520
That was Shaffner,
but he was--

14:55.520 --> 14:57.440
he was young.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.840
I know.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.200
It's like if we're back
in the sixties.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.520
How could that happen?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.360
You said it was
your necklace.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.960
Take it off.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.040
Oh, man!

15:13.040 --> 15:14.880
Oh, man,
this is wild.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.880
<i>It is
the necklace.</i>

15:16.880 --> 15:19.880
It has some kind
of power.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.320
Candy. That girl
called you Candy.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.960
Who is Candy?

15:25.960 --> 15:28.400
I don't know,
but we can find out.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.480
Come on.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.840
Hey, come here.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.840
You see,
I'm checking 1968,

15:41.840 --> 15:44.120
when the white album
came out.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.080
Bingo.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.080
What?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.400
Candy Warren--
locker 22.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.640
Yeah, that was
her locker, all right.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.680
Who was she?

15:54.600 --> 15:56.920
I don't get it.
Why isn't she here?

15:56.920 --> 15:58.520
Check
the next year again.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.760
I checked three times.
She isn't here.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.480
There.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.800
That's her.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.240
That's the ghost.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.840
This is real, isn't it?

16:12.840 --> 16:16.040
I guess. We can't
both be crazy.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.520
Why is Candy
showing herself to me,

16:18.520 --> 16:20.840
<i>and why do they
think I'm Candy?</i>

16:20.840 --> 16:22.480
I don't know.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.320
Whatever's
going on here,

16:24.320 --> 16:26.920
we can't handle it,
all right?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.480
Well, what do we do?

16:28.480 --> 16:30.320
I don't know.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.800
I feel like
she's trying

16:31.800 --> 16:33.320
to tell me
something, Chris.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.800
This is happening
for a reason.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.840
Maybe. Come on.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.320
Let's get out
of here.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.160
I have to get my books.
Let's talk tonight.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.680
OK. Later.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.320
Mr. Radeau.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.840
Chris,
you're here late.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.560
Mr. Radeau, you've
been teaching here,

17:02.560 --> 17:03.840
like, forever, right?

17:03.840 --> 17:06.599
Yeah, I suppose 30
years is forever to you.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.960
Did you know
a Candy Warren?

17:08.960 --> 17:11.000
Candy Warren.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.520
Haven't thought
of her in years.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.680
Sure, I knew her.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.839
Sweet girl.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.440
Such a tragedy.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.800
Well, how did she die?

17:21.800 --> 17:23.359
Was she, like, sick
or something?

17:23.359 --> 17:24.680
Heavens, no.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.480
It was
a horrible accident.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.119
What, a car crash?

17:28.119 --> 17:30.120
No, it happened
right here.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.480
At Derby?

17:40.480 --> 17:42.480
Miss Warren--now!

17:48.120 --> 17:50.000
She was staying late
after school

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
on some chemistry
project or something.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.600
Apparently she got
a little careless...

17:57.360 --> 18:01.960
And there was an
explosion and fire and...

18:05.640 --> 18:09.160
It's hard to even
think about it now.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.360
Why do you ask?

18:11.360 --> 18:12.920
Who was her teacher?

18:12.920 --> 18:17.000
Ooh, that was
many years ago. I--

18:17.000 --> 18:19.800
I don't...

18:19.800 --> 18:22.080
Thanks, Mr. Radeau.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.200
Oh, wait.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.520
It was
Mr. Shaffner.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.520
Before he became
assistant principal,

18:26.520 --> 18:28.680
he worked in the
chemistry department.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.840
Nice of you
to join me.

18:46.840 --> 18:47.560
Julie!

18:48.920 --> 18:49.640
Julie.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.040
Julie.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.440
Julie!

19:01.920 --> 19:03.280
[Mr. Shaffner]
Sit.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.960
Worksheets,
thermometer, beakers...

19:11.960 --> 19:14.640
And a pipette
for measuring.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.080
Swell.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.520
Could you, um...

19:27.520 --> 19:29.560
Explain what we're doing?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.040
We're identifying
compounds

19:31.040 --> 19:34.040
by determining
their melting points.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.800
Or would you
like to skip

19:35.800 --> 19:37.280
right to
summer school now?

19:37.280 --> 19:38.280
No, no.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.080
I want to try.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.080
How do I do this?

19:43.080 --> 19:45.840
That's what this test
is about now, isn't it?

19:47.760 --> 19:49.680
I'll give you
a little hint.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.720
Turn on the gas
and light the burner.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.720
After that
you're on your own.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.600
I'll be back
in 20 minutes.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.120
Whoa! Candy.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.320
Um, is Julie
in the past?

20:30.080 --> 20:31.400
[Gas hissing]

20:41.880 --> 20:43.320
I hate this stuff.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.160
Listen, Candy.
She's going to die.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.280
You got to stop her.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.440
Wet.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.000
Julie!

21:12.800 --> 21:14.320
Hey, no running.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.240
Come on, man. Julie
-- I mean Candy--

21:16.240 --> 21:17.240
Candy's in trouble.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.360
She certainly is.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.840
She's going to flunk.
Bummer!

21:19.840 --> 21:21.320
Come on, man.
Let me go.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.720
Man, let me go!

21:26.720 --> 21:27.800
Who are you, anyway?

21:27.800 --> 21:29.360
I'm your future,
pal.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.960
Let go!

21:33.320 --> 21:34.800
Julie!

21:40.040 --> 21:42.720
What are you doing?

21:42.720 --> 21:44.760
Yes. What were
you doing?

21:44.760 --> 21:46.160
If you think
you can--

21:46.160 --> 21:48.200
Stop. Just stop! Look at
this. It's rotted through.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.960
If you'd have put
fire into this,

21:49.960 --> 21:51.920
the whole place
would have gone up.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.760
Hey, don't you check your
equipment, Mr. Shaffner?

21:53.760 --> 21:54.600
My God!

21:56.760 --> 21:59.080
You could
have been killed.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.840
I don't know
what to say.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.120
Say you're in
the wrong line of work.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.040
Thank God
you saw this.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.760
If you hadn't...

22:11.760 --> 22:14.000
I would have been toast.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.240
So that's
how Candy died.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.000
Yeah. I saw her.
She brought me back.

22:22.000 --> 22:22.680
Oh, man!

22:22.680 --> 22:24.680
Come here.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.480
Ahem!

22:30.480 --> 22:33.000
Can I ask what
you're doing here so late?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.240
I, um...

22:34.240 --> 22:36.520
I was helping her
with her locker.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.160
It's stuck.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
<i>At least,
it was stuck.</i>

22:41.800 --> 22:44.240
Oh, I know. It used to stick
for me all the time, too.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.680
For you?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.960
That was
your locker?

22:47.960 --> 22:50.200
Back in the dark ages.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.520
You must be Julie Dufaux.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.160
Nice to meet you.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.680
Who are you?

22:55.680 --> 22:57.680
I'm the assistant principal--
Ms. Warren.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.960
Candy Warren.

23:04.720 --> 23:08.560
Gentlemen,
my office, please.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.120
The end.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.520
Far out.

23:18.520 --> 23:19.680
Solid!

23:19.680 --> 23:20.480
Psychedelic.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.720
Um...

23:23.040 --> 23:24.640
Neat-o?

23:30.400 --> 23:31.840
That was
a cool story.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.840
Thanks, man.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.840
Good story, Chris.
