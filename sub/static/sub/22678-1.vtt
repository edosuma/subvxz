talking back to you.

here to replace it.

09:07.180 --> 09:07.915

Quinn was on the couch.

bring my daughter to stagings.

was busy, and, uh

wasn't special to you.

with the house.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.941
And that's why trash TV
never got a hold of my phone

13:28.775 --> 13:30.110
and intercepted my messages.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.145
That's why none of my talent

13:33.413 --> 13:34.882
ever walked away from
a sold out stadium.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.985
Are you starting to
notice a difference

13:37.985 --> 13:39.619
between you and me Billy?

13:39.619 --> 13:40.453
Yeah, I think I am.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.091
So if it were me, I would
forget about everything else

13:45.458 --> 13:47.494
and find the most profitable
star on our rooster.

13:49.062 --> 13:49.429
And how do you
propose I do that?

13:51.031 --> 13:52.299
He's obviously on some

13:53.533 --> 13:55.969
lost artist woe-is-me
touchey-feely search.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.472
So get back to your good ol'
boy roots and get looking.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.275
Mary...

14:03.643 --> 14:05.312
I have a lot of other acts

14:05.312 --> 14:06.179
that I need to pay
attention to so I can't...

14:07.447 --> 14:09.382
I'm sorry.
Why are you still talking?

14:09.382 --> 14:10.683
I could have sworn
I just told you

14:10.683 --> 14:11.484
word for word what to do.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.787
Oh, and since you
seem to have trouble

14:14.787 --> 14:16.356
reading between the lines.

14:16.356 --> 14:16.990
Bring back Zane

14:17.790 --> 14:18.591
or don't come back.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.366
Rebecca!
My latte!

15:33.733 --> 15:35.102
I didn't hear you come in.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.172
She made you supper.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.207
I see that.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.611
So how did operation replace
the broken vase go?

15:46.013 --> 15:48.215
Oh, I, ah, I got
caught red-handed.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.051
Oh crap. Did you get
into a bunch of trouble?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.320
Um, no.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.057
Turns out the homeowner has a
pretty nice six-pack though.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.728
Exactly what kind of trouble
did you get into young lady?

16:03.263 --> 16:05.232
Nothing happened. It was just
a bright spot in my day.

16:08.235 --> 16:11.038
When I was in Italy,
I dated this guy named Franco.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.107
- It was before I met your dad.
- Uh, huh.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.243
(SIGH)

16:16.743 --> 16:17.444
Fine.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.747
My point is, it would
not hurt for you

16:20.747 --> 16:22.215
to get yourself back out there.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.083
It's been a long time.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.419
- I know you mean well.
- I do.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.556
But I've got a lot on
my plate right now.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.524
I just want you to be happy.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.193
I am happy.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.697
But I've got a lot
of studying to do.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.199
Got it.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.373
Don't stay up too late.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.409
And you don't stay up too
late dreaming about Franko.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.211
- Franco.
- Oh, okay.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.081
His name is Franco.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.108
(PHONE RINGING)

17:26.913 --> 17:28.415
Hey Marco, I'm heading
over to the house now.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.350
I'm just running a bit late.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.518
Hey Jeannette, that's
why I'm calling.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.819
I have some bad news.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.154
What's up?

17:34.154 --> 17:35.555
I got a call from the

17:35.555 --> 17:37.357
property manager
this morning.

17:37.357 --> 17:37.790
The owner is cancelling
the staging service.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.326
What?

17:40.793 --> 17:42.995
I'm sorry, I know what a
great job you were doing

17:42.995 --> 17:43.630
And it would have been great
for your resume.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.232
Is this about the vase?

17:46.133 --> 17:46.466
No.
What vase?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.936
I replaced it.
He said it was fine.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.904
I don't know what to
tell you, Jeannette.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.140
I wish I had another
job for you right now,

17:54.307 --> 17:54.941
especially since
it's Christmas.

17:54.941 --> 17:55.875
That jerk.

17:55.875 --> 17:56.243
Who?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.911
(SIGH)
Never mind.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.812
I need that key
back right away.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.581
Okay.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.854
(MONICA) And then there was
this one time when I was seven.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.723
My mom signed me up for ballet
classes for the first time.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.593
Ah huh.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.861
I didn't spend half of that
class knocking people.

18:15.795 --> 18:16.396
And myself too.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.366
But then after the dance class
I overheard the dance teacher

18:20.633 --> 18:21.568
talking to my mom saying
that I have two left feet.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.403
Jolene, can you believe it?

18:24.837 --> 18:26.739
I had three people tell me I
have two left feet in one week!

18:26.739 --> 18:28.175
You don't say?

18:28.175 --> 18:29.176
That's when my mom said

18:30.410 --> 18:31.278
I should probably just
start singing instead.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.179
(BANGING)

18:36.283 --> 18:37.317
Oh ah, sweetie.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.453
You think you should be the
one handling that staple gun?

18:41.654 --> 18:42.455
Why not, I mean I've
never used one before,

18:43.290 --> 18:44.491
but I have fired a real gun.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.559
Now, why on God's green earth?

18:47.427 --> 18:49.329
Well Michael, my ex-boyfriend,

18:49.329 --> 18:51.198
he used to take me to
his uncle's junk yard

18:51.198 --> 18:51.731
to fire guns all the time.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.201
This one time he...

18:54.201 --> 18:54.467
(STAPLE FIRING)
(GLASS BREAKING)

18:55.835 --> 18:57.670
Jolene, I am so sorry.
I don't know what happened...

18:57.670 --> 19:00.006
You know what, I
got a great idea.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.208
Why don't we take a lunch break.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.376
And we'll just hang
this after we eat.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.745
Yeah, okay.
I'm hungry.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.549
(TO HERSELF) Thank the Lord
that one's cute as a button.

19:10.250 --> 19:10.850
(DOOR CREAKS OPEN)

19:13.019 --> 19:14.387
You know, if you've trying
to stay incognito,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.924
you have got to stop wearing
that God-awful cologne.

19:19.292 --> 19:19.926
I stopped wearing that
cologne years ago.

19:21.093 --> 19:21.928
Well I can still smell it.

19:24.664 --> 19:28.235
Zane Thomas Gunther.
What are you doing here?

19:28.235 --> 19:28.801
Oh, it's good to see you.

19:30.737 --> 19:31.238
I missed you.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.373
I missed you too.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.409
Man, you got half
the music industry

19:37.710 --> 19:38.745
camped out at your folk's
old place in Florida.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.014
You got the other half
steppin' in cow pies

19:42.014 --> 19:43.850
at your big ranch in California.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.354
And here you are in our
little bitty town.

19:48.087 --> 19:48.721
I like it here.

19:50.122 --> 19:50.923
Well, you always did.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.561
You know we had to shut down
the music camp?

19:55.762 --> 19:56.763
Yeah, I heard about that.
That's too bad.

19:58.498 --> 19:58.965
You know I learned a
lot from you there.

20:00.066 --> 20:00.567
You got me out of my shell.

20:02.001 --> 20:02.669
Do you remember how shy I was?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.305
I was terrified of the stage.
(CHUCKLES)

20:06.973 --> 20:09.442
Well you had it in you then and
you still got it in you now.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.711
It's just good to see you
in the real world.

20:12.245 --> 20:12.979
Ah well.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.848
I could use a dose of the
real world right about now.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.588
I was sorry to hear
about your dad.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.423
Thanks.

20:25.992 --> 20:26.826
So what is it?

20:27.894 --> 20:29.762
Girl break your heart?

20:29.762 --> 20:32.332
Naw. (LAUGHS)
Naw. She wasn't right for me.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.803
Did you blow all your money
on that terrible cologne?

20:37.604 --> 20:38.338
(LAUGHS)

20:41.173 --> 20:42.575
How many times do you think
I sang last year?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.478
Mmmm, I don't know.
Hundred?

20:46.879 --> 20:47.580
Zero.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.817
The insurance company tells me

20:51.684 --> 20:52.585
I shouldn't sing my own shows.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.020
I mean I gotta lip sync.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.790
Man, things have
changed, haven't they?

20:58.925 --> 21:01.027
They used to be happy
to make you sing

21:01.027 --> 21:01.594
till you couldn't sing anymore.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.596
I know.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.564
It's not what I signed up for.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.667
Do you think this is
what I signed up for?

21:09.035 --> 21:10.337
You know, I miss those days.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.406
Riding across the country
in a nice big bus.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.443
People screaming your name
wanting your autograph.

21:17.544 --> 21:18.711
We didn't do selfies.

it was cracked up to be either.

of putting a spin on it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm
grateful, okay, I am but...

21:35.828 --> 21:37.597
To be honest, if I ain't
singing and writing,

21:37.597 --> 21:38.498
I just can't do it anymore.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.401
That's why I thought it
might be good for me

21:41.401 --> 21:41.868
to come out here
and clear my head.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.372
Does Billy know you're here?

21:48.841 --> 21:49.509
Nope.

I don't know.
I didn't stop to find out.

I got out of there
as fast as I could.

- Jeannette!

- Hi Jolene.
- Everything okay?

22:35.287 --> 22:35.655
You know, if you were really
that upset about the vase

22:38.691 --> 22:39.992
I'm sorry it broke, I am.
But I did the best I could.

You might be rich,

22:45.698 --> 22:47.099
but some of us have to work
very hard for a living.

22:48.435 --> 22:48.968
Some of us have people
who count on us.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.504
So why don't you think
of that next time

22:52.772 --> 22:54.040
you get someone fired for
breaking a stupid vase.

Jeannette fired?

23:00.179 --> 23:00.980
(TOGETHER): We're friends.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.751
Look, I didn't call anyone.
Okay.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.555
Ah, wait.
You didn't?

23:11.123 --> 23:12.459
No, I actually really liked
that vase you got me.

23:15.795 --> 23:19.165
So...you didn't call my boss
and get me fired?

23:21.534 --> 23:22.802
Okay, this is what you'd
call real awkward.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.039
Look I, I took the
house off the market.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.041
And I guess the
real estate agent

23:29.041 --> 23:30.477
thought that it didn't
need to be staged anymore.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.713
I...I'm really sorry.

were mad and...

than I'd care to admit.

your clothes on this time.

came out of the shower, okay?

24:50.022 --> 24:51.758
Zane...Gunther?

24:52.224 --> 24:52.992
(LAUGHS)

24:54.326 --> 24:56.663
Zane, Zane Gunther the musician.
(EMBARASSED LAUGH)

24:58.097 --> 25:00.132
Oh okay, umm. You know what?
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.568
Bye.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.269

25:14.013 --> 25:14.847
Hey mom.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.149
Ah, no.
Nothing's wrong.

25:18.585 --> 25:19.051
Actually, I just got fired.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.988
Yeah. It's okay, though,
I got another job.

25:22.421 --> 25:23.189
Uh huh.

25:24.591 --> 25:25.958
Yeah, it's...
been a weird morning.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.160
I'll tell you all about
it when I get home.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.964
(DOOR OPENING) Ah, mom,
I gotta go. Okay, bye.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.299
- Jeannette, hey.
- Hey.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.703
I'm really sorry about that.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.239
I jumped to conclusions,
and you didn't deserve it.

25:41.608 --> 25:42.609
It's all good.
I, ah, cost you a job

25:43.776 --> 25:45.612
and I was hoping to
make it up to you

25:45.612 --> 25:46.879
by maybe taking you
out for dinner.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.048
Like a...like a date?

25:50.516 --> 25:52.118
Yeah, yeah, sure why not?
I mean unless you're married?

25:53.085 --> 25:55.187
I'm not, umm,

25:55.187 --> 25:56.889
but dating is not really
something I'm doing right now.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.225
So...thanks anyway.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.994
It's all good.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.696
Like I said, I just feel
terrible about everything.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.699
I, ah...just want
to make it right.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.636
- You have a nice day.
- You too.

Good morning

26:46.472 --> 26:47.239
Hello?

26:48.975 --> 26:49.876
Can I get you something
there, Mr. Fancy Suit.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.144
Same old Marty.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.080
How's that then?

26:56.883 --> 26:57.750
It's me, Bill.

26:59.418 --> 26:59.952
Do I know you?

27:03.422 --> 27:04.090
It's Billy goat.

27:06.592 --> 27:07.159
Little Billy goat?

27:08.795 --> 27:09.862
- From music camp?
- Yeah.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.732
(LAUGHS)
You gotta be kidding me!

27:13.399 --> 27:14.901
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

27:15.702 --> 27:16.402
Come on.
Do the goat.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.271
No, I don't do that anymore.

27:20.406 --> 27:21.974
You know I never really
liked that at camp

27:21.974 --> 27:23.009
when you made me do that.

27:24.143 --> 27:24.711
Do the goat.

27:25.511 --> 27:26.178
Marty.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.916
It took me a lot of time in
therapy to get over that.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.217
- I don't do that anymore.
- Just do it!

27:32.484 --> 27:34.954
(SIGH) It's nice to see
you've come so far since

27:36.022 --> 27:38.891
working here at
your father's bar.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.927
Yeah. So.
Whatever happened to you?

27:42.094 --> 27:43.763
Guess you got a big city job?

27:43.763 --> 27:45.264
Yeah, I...got an executive job.

27:46.799 --> 27:47.734
I manage Zane.

27:50.469 --> 27:53.773
And I just thought I'd stop by
to see if you might of seen him.

27:54.741 --> 27:55.241
Zane Gunther?

27:56.442 --> 27:57.810
You think Zane Gunther
might be here?

27:59.879 --> 28:01.013
Well, here's not at
his home in Florida.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.350
And he's not at his ranch
in California, so...

28:05.651 --> 28:06.919
I know he's always
had this, ah...

28:08.120 --> 28:10.289
Thing for this small town.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.158
Well how about that.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.961
Somebody with big city options

28:14.961 --> 28:16.128
decides they like this
small town of ours.

28:20.199 --> 28:20.833
- I'm sorry.
- Uh huh.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.805
Hey, can I get a sandwich to go?

28:25.805 --> 28:26.773
No.

28:32.779 --> 28:33.780
Good morning.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.282
Well, aren't you a
sight for sore eyes.

28:36.883 --> 28:37.483
Thanks, Jolene.

28:38.785 --> 28:39.485
I was talking to the coffee.

28:40.853 --> 28:41.487
(BANGING AND CRASHING)
Sorry.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.792
Oh, Monica, sweetie. Why don't
you come out here for a minute?

28:47.693 --> 28:49.829
Jolene, that staple gun just
keeps going off on it's own.

28:50.529 --> 28:50.963
I think it's broken.

28:52.231 --> 28:52.932
Well, don't worry
about it right now.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.501
This is my friend Jeannette.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.069
Jeannette, Monica.
Monica meet Jeannette.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.839
I think I've seen
you around before.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.573
At the coffee shop, right?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.308
Yeah, that's right.
I work there twice a week.

29:05.845 --> 29:06.946
Coffee!

29:08.280 --> 29:09.448
I don't think this
one needs caffeine.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.418
I love coffee. I've only had
three cups this morning.

29:13.285 --> 29:13.820
(DOOR OPENING)

29:19.325 --> 29:19.959
Ah, Monica.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.162
Why don't you and I go see if
we can fix that staple gun?

29:24.363 --> 29:25.531
- Okay. - Okay, go ahead. I'll
be right there.

29:26.732 --> 29:27.366
Jolene, what is he doing here?

29:28.901 --> 29:31.037
What?
He wanted to help out.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.205
- Good morning.
- Jolene!

29:34.373 --> 29:35.241
- How are you?
- Good. How're you doing.

29:36.008 --> 29:36.909
Good morning, Jeannette.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.379
Jeannette was nice enough to
bring us coffee this morning.

29:41.848 --> 29:42.381
Thank you!

29:43.615 --> 29:44.851
Ah, Jolene...

29:45.952 --> 29:47.887
Hi! Nice to meet you!
I'm Monica.

29:48.687 --> 29:49.288
Nice to meet you.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.993
You know, you kind of look like
that Zane Gunther

29:53.993 --> 29:55.161
everybody's been looking for.

29:56.328 --> 29:56.929
Yeah.
I get that sometimes.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.466
Ha ha.
That's funny. (LAUGHS)

30:02.201 --> 30:03.435
Jolene, I kind of made
a mess backstage.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.105
It's okay.
Go ahead.

30:07.406 --> 30:08.440
- I'll be there to help you
clean it up. - Okay.

30:09.842 --> 30:12.411
Jeannette, there's the stage,

30:12.411 --> 30:13.545
there's some set pieces
behind the curtain

30:14.914 --> 30:17.083
and there's decorations
on the table, so...

30:18.617 --> 30:20.920
Why don't you two see what
you can come up with and...

30:21.787 --> 30:22.388
fill me in when I get back.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.195
Well, I guess w're
working together.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.331
Yeah, I guess so.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.566
Look, I don't want
to step on your toes

30:34.566 --> 30:35.167
so if there's anything I can
do to help, you let me know.

30:35.601 --> 30:36.302
Okay.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.270
- Let's get to work.
- All right.

30:44.743 --> 30:45.411
"Last Saturday Night"?

30:46.312 --> 30:47.213
No.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.081
"Hometown Summer"?

30:49.581 --> 30:50.917
Uh, uh.

30:50.917 --> 30:51.417
"I Got Horsepower"?

30:52.584 --> 30:53.185
Oh, yeah that one I know.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.454
I was one of 12
writers on that one.

30:56.722 --> 30:57.589
Not my finest work, but, uh...

30:58.824 --> 31:00.326
it sure as heck
did sell records.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.363
I'm really sorry.
You're super talented, I just...

31:06.065 --> 31:07.967
I like my music more
on the quiet side.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.168
There's nothing wrong with that.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.804
Well it's been three
three days now

31:12.804 --> 31:13.973
and you haven't asked me
any of the questions.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.075
What are the questions?

31:17.276 --> 31:19.111
Well, most people ask
me the same things.

31:20.846 --> 31:22.281
Where do I buy my clothes?
What song earned me the most?

31:23.449 --> 31:24.616
You haven't even asked
me for a picture.

31:25.651 --> 31:26.218
(CHUCKLES)

31:28.420 --> 31:29.521
I'd rather know about you than
what's going on around you.

31:33.092 --> 31:33.960
What about you?

31:36.228 --> 31:37.529
Huh?
I know you have a...

31:39.131 --> 31:40.566
an amazing daughter,
an amazing mother.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.003
But, uh, tell me something
about you I don't know.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.307
Well, you know 'm a single mom.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.178
That I work as many jobs
as I have time for.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.814
Next year I will be graduating

31:55.814 --> 31:58.985
with a degree in
Interior Design.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.552
That's incredible.
That I did not know.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.289
I guess that explains
why my house

32:03.289 --> 32:04.190
looks like a million bucks.

32:04.723 --> 32:05.291
Thank you.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.228
I really love music.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.365
Just...not the type that's
on the radio. No offense.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.067
No.
None taken.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.471
Now, I'm going to throw you
into the deep end here.

32:21.473 --> 32:22.541
What's the song that
changed your life?

32:24.176 --> 32:25.244
Changed my life?

32:27.013 --> 32:28.347
No top five favourites
or anything?

32:29.048 --> 32:29.615
Nah, it's boring.

32:30.582 --> 32:31.250
Okay.

32:35.354 --> 32:38.257
When Quinn was a baby,
we moved in with my mom.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.261
I was new in town, and
Jolene was my first friend.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.331
Her kids were older than Quinn

32:45.331 --> 32:46.632
so I went to her
for advice a lot.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.472
And when Quinn was six months
old she got her first tooth.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.443
She was up for three
days straight

32:57.443 --> 32:59.045
and I was at the end of my rope.

33:00.879 --> 33:03.782
And Jolene didn't have a cure
for a teething baby,

33:03.782 --> 33:05.717
but she did send me a song.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.488
And it said what I
needed to hear.

33:10.722 --> 33:11.757
It gave me strength.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.062
I haven't heard
that song in years.

33:17.263 --> 33:18.064
The power of music.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.299
Yeah.

33:23.769 --> 33:24.770
"I know that you are scared

33:26.772 --> 33:28.474
"But troubles fade
when they are shared

33:30.442 --> 33:31.510
"We'll hold each other up

33:33.579 --> 33:34.613
(TOGETHER):
"Until we see the sunrise."

33:36.648 --> 33:37.483
Wow.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.620
I recorded that song in
Jolene's barn 10 years ago.

33:44.723 --> 33:45.757
I didn't think that
anyone had ever heard it.

33:46.558 --> 33:47.826
That was you?

33:47.826 --> 33:49.095
(LAUGHS)
Yeah.

33:52.398 --> 33:53.632
- I like that song.
- Well thank you.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.136
(QUINN):
Mommy!

33:59.105 --> 34:00.406
- Mommy!
- Hey there ladybug.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.576
Shouldn't you be in school?

34:05.511 --> 34:07.179
No, it's Christmas break!

34:07.946 --> 34:08.813
Ah, that's right.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.783
Is this the Quinn I've
heard so much about?

34:12.918 --> 34:13.452
Aren't you a cutie pie.

34:14.820 --> 34:15.754
It's an absolute pleasure
to meet you. I'm Zane.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.757
Is this the fellow

34:18.757 --> 34:19.425
you were telling me
about the other night?

34:20.859 --> 34:21.827
Oh, you told your mom about me?

34:24.196 --> 34:24.663
You were right, he...

34:25.331 --> 34:26.398
- Mom!
- Yeah.

34:27.132 --> 34:27.833
This is Zane.

34:28.867 --> 34:29.701
Zane, this is my mother Suzanne.

34:30.902 --> 34:31.402
It's a pleasure to meet you.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.172
The pleasure's all mine.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.908
I have to go to the gallery
and meet a local artist

34:36.908 --> 34:37.443
so I have to go.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.411
Okay.
I hope you two had fun.

34:40.379 --> 34:41.679
- We always do, right?
- Yeah!

34:42.281 --> 34:43.215
See you then.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.719
- Ah, it's my buddy Quinn.
- Hi Jolene!

34:48.320 --> 34:49.155
How are you?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.489
You know what?

34:51.489 --> 34:53.159
I saw you sing at your
Christmas concert

34:53.159 --> 34:54.226
and you knocked my socks off.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.161
(GIGGLES)

34:56.695 --> 34:58.330
Now, I need your mom to help
me for a little while longer.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.466
So what would you like to do?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.535
- Can we go to the park?
- In the snow?

35:04.736 --> 35:06.405
Quinn, I brought crafts
and a colouring book

35:06.405 --> 35:07.773
for you to do here.

35:07.773 --> 35:08.674
Awwww, please.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.510
Zane, what are you up to?

35:13.512 --> 35:15.647
Well, I was kind of hoping
to go play in the park.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.517
Did you happen to see a
swing set out there?

35:19.618 --> 35:20.319
I think so.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.221
Zane, you really do't have to.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.890
Oh, don't worry about it.
He'd love to.

35:25.657 --> 35:26.458
I would.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.427
Please mom, please?

35:29.195 --> 35:29.861
Okay.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.463
Yes.

35:32.264 --> 35:32.864
Let's do it.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.771
So how come you don't
live in that big house?

35:41.373 --> 35:42.474
Because I bought
it for my brother.

35:43.509 --> 35:44.643
Then why isn't he here?

35:46.111 --> 35:47.713
Well he figured he was better
suited for the big city.

35:49.515 --> 35:49.881
Do you like your brother?

35:50.716 --> 35:51.250
Very much so.

the legs.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.269

36:11.670 --> 36:13.572
Well I drive a little blue car
that my dad gave me

36:13.572 --> 36:14.540
when I was a teenager.

36:15.106 --> 36:15.741
I like blue.

- Do you?
- Yeah.

- All right you like this slide
then? - Yeah.

Yeah, I'm aware of that.

She used to be married to my
daddy but, he passed away.

36:43.001 --> 36:43.635
I'm really sorry to hear that.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.604
He was a hero.

36:58.784 --> 36:59.785
How come you don't have
a Christmas tree up?

37:01.019 --> 37:01.687
That is a very good question.

37:03.555 --> 37:03.989
You should put up
a Christmas tree.

37:05.857 --> 37:06.425
You're absolutely right.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.494
Do you know that Christmas
trees are my favorite.

37:09.027 --> 37:09.728
Mine too.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.398
You need the Christmas tree

37:12.398 --> 37:13.532
so Santa has somewhere
to put your presents.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.301
Exactly, that's
why you gotta get

37:16.368 --> 37:17.336
the biggest Christmas
tree you can.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.671
I don't get a lot of presents.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.443
Oh, you know what?

37:25.611 --> 37:27.078
I didn't get a lot of
Christmas presents

37:27.078 --> 37:27.813
when I was your age either.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.448
How come?

37:30.516 --> 37:31.517
Well, I was just like you.

Well, not exactly like
you, I was a little boy.

37:40.626 --> 37:41.660
we just didn't have
a lot of money left for gifts.

37:42.361 --> 37:42.994
What about Santa.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.332
Well of course Santa
brought us stuff. Come on.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.435
I don't ask Santa for
expensive presents anymore.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.870
Last year, I asked him
for a game system but

37:52.704 --> 37:53.572
I guess he couldn't make it.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.075

would be pretty tough

37:57.075 --> 37:58.344
for those little elves
to make electronics.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.347
He got me these gloves instead.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.893
Used to do it as a kid.
That's how we heated the house.

47:07.893 --> 47:08.894
It was my job to chop the wood.

47:10.428 --> 47:11.062
Look.

47:13.164 --> 47:14.933
I wanted to say thank you.
For last night.

47:16.267 --> 47:17.903
What you did was really nice and

47:19.437 --> 47:20.571
I was too busy trying to find
something wrong with it.

47:22.974 --> 47:24.042
It's just been Quinn
and I for so long

47:24.609 --> 47:25.176
You know?

47:27.312 --> 47:30.248
And if I'm being a
hundred percent honest

47:31.449 --> 47:33.418
I hated seeing you give
her something I can't.

47:35.086 --> 47:36.955
Yeah, well I should have
run that by you first.

47:37.588 --> 47:38.189
No, it's okay.

47:39.424 --> 47:40.491
She told me that you
guys talked about it.

47:41.626 --> 47:42.560
It was a really thoughtful gift.

47:44.029 --> 47:45.596
And I should never
get in the way

47:46.998 --> 47:48.199
of someone who made my
little girl smile so

47:48.833 --> 47:49.600
Thank you.

47:51.102 --> 47:52.203
Well, I appreciate you
coming by to say that.

47:54.005 --> 47:55.206
And I was hoping I could
make it up to you.

47:55.773 --> 47:56.341
My treat.

47:56.942 --> 47:58.977
Oh.

47:58.977 --> 48:00.778
I can't ask you to
spend any money on me.

48:00.778 --> 48:01.146
No, don't worry about that.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.349
I also know you need
to stay hidden so

48:06.651 --> 48:07.285
Here.

48:07.785 --> 48:08.419
Well.

48:09.587 --> 48:10.121
What do you say?

48:11.522 --> 48:12.323
I say yes.

48:13.959 --> 48:14.993
All right.

48:14.993 --> 48:15.626
Jeez.

48:17.128 --> 48:17.662
- How do I look?
- Great.

48:18.396 --> 48:19.630
All right.

48:19.630 --> 48:20.298
Your chariot awaits.

48:43.621 --> 48:44.555
All right.

48:50.361 --> 48:51.262
Starting with a
little light B&E?

48:52.097 --> 48:53.331
It's my mom's gallery.

48:53.999 --> 48:55.033
Come on.

49:04.709 --> 49:05.610
Okay.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.347
There should be Christmas
decorations in here somewhere.

49:10.748 --> 49:11.582
You know, I was never
very good at decorating.

49:12.683 --> 49:13.351
That's why you have me.

49:14.185 --> 49:15.086
Yeah, that's right.

49:16.721 --> 49:18.356
You were my decorator, until
I got you fired that is.

49:20.525 --> 49:22.693
And when I graduate and become
a famous interior designer

49:23.628 --> 49:24.562
you can hire me back.

49:26.031 --> 49:26.731
All right.

49:27.732 --> 49:28.499
Sorry.

49:31.502 --> 49:32.203
Sorry.

49:41.679 --> 49:42.480
I honestly don't
know how you do it.

49:43.948 --> 49:44.649
You're working two jobs

49:46.751 --> 49:47.685
taking night courses

49:49.254 --> 49:50.155
raising an amazing daughter.

49:56.527 --> 49:57.662
I think that's the other box.

50:03.901 --> 50:04.735
Whoa, it's heavy.

50:08.373 --> 50:08.773
I'm serious, though.

50:09.807 --> 50:10.508
It's ah...

50:13.211 --> 50:14.079
It's inspiring.

50:18.316 --> 50:20.685
Ah, I think this is everything.

50:28.893 --> 50:30.795
Next, we cut down one of those.

50:32.463 --> 50:33.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We can't
just steal a Christmas tree.

50:34.699 --> 50:35.433
This is your property.

50:37.135 --> 50:37.802
Really?

50:38.569 --> 50:39.237
Uh huh.

50:40.405 --> 50:42.073
All right.
Well, let's go check it out.

50:45.143 --> 50:49.214
So my dad figures if the
cat won't leave it alone

50:50.081 --> 50:52.016
he'll just put it up high enough

50:52.016 --> 50:52.450
that Mr. Snuggles
can't reach it.

50:53.584 --> 50:54.352
Oh, I think I know
where this is going.

50:55.686 --> 50:57.255
So it's three a.m. and
we hear a huge crash.

50:58.856 --> 51:00.525
We come downstairs, the
tree is on the ground

51:01.726 --> 51:03.961
everything's a mess and
there is Mr. Snuggles

51:03.961 --> 51:04.729
in the corner with the
decoration in his mouth.

51:05.263 --> 51:06.131
(LAUGHTER)

51:07.298 --> 51:09.167
Well, we don't have to
worry about that mess.

51:09.167 --> 51:10.368
There's no cats,
no dogs, just me.

51:15.806 --> 51:17.175
So how long are you
going to hide out here?

51:20.178 --> 51:20.845
Well, I hadn't really
thought about it.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.482
I didn't realize how much I
missed the peace and quiet.

51:26.951 --> 51:27.518
You like this little town?

51:29.254 --> 51:30.155
Yeah, yeah.

51:31.622 --> 51:32.390
Most people can't wait
to get out of here.

51:32.957 --> 51:33.558
Well, I ah

51:34.792 --> 51:35.726
have a bit of a
history here, though.

51:36.694 --> 51:37.262
My parents used to

51:39.029 --> 51:40.331
bring my brother and I here
for music summer camp.

51:41.832 --> 51:42.800
This is where I fell
in love with music.

51:45.170 --> 51:46.537
But, ah, back to your point.

51:48.673 --> 51:51.776
Most people they want to
get out of a small town

51:51.776 --> 51:53.178
because they're searching
for something, right.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.414
And they think they can
find that in a bigger city.

51:57.948 --> 51:58.683
And you?

52:01.018 --> 52:03.754
Well, I've been to just about
every big city there is

52:03.754 --> 52:06.591
and I can tell you
that finding happiness

52:06.591 --> 52:08.559
isn't about how many
intersections there are.

52:11.196 --> 52:12.530
And where do you find happiness?

52:14.031 --> 52:15.433
Well, it's just about the
people you're with and

52:16.234 --> 52:16.901
the experiences you have.

52:17.968 --> 52:19.804
It's about moments.

52:22.072 --> 52:24.709
Being happy's not just about
big days, with big wins.

52:25.610 --> 52:28.413
It's about those little moments.

52:30.781 --> 52:33.684
Like...a cup of coffee with your
newspaper on Sunday morning.

52:33.684 --> 52:35.753
Yeah.
That's a good one.

52:35.753 --> 52:40.658
Or, ah, standing in the forest
just closing your eyes,

52:40.658 --> 52:41.859
listening to the wind
blow through the trees.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.695
Or listening to an old record.

52:45.696 --> 52:47.232
That's a good one.
Yes.

52:48.966 --> 52:51.236
Or, decorating a Christmas tree
with a new friend.

52:52.770 --> 52:53.471
Friend?

52:54.305 --> 52:55.306
Yeah, we're friends.

52:57.275 --> 52:58.376
I thought we were more
than just friends.

53:04.915 --> 53:05.716
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

53:08.319 --> 53:09.354
Sorry.

53:12.857 --> 53:13.524
Hey sweetie.

53:14.158 --> 53:14.759
Everything okay?

53:16.126 --> 53:16.661
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

53:18.363 --> 53:18.829
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

53:21.799 --> 53:23.301
Hey Mary, I was just
about to call you.

53:25.336 --> 53:27.338
Oh that's good because

53:27.338 --> 53:28.739
I was worried I
was calling you

53:28.739 --> 53:29.707
to fire you for
not finding Zane.

53:30.841 --> 53:31.809
Where should I send
your gift basket?

53:33.478 --> 53:34.479
Funny thing is, I haven't
found him just yet.

53:35.313 --> 53:35.946
But I'm getting close.

53:38.349 --> 53:38.983
How is that funny?

53:40.618 --> 53:41.286
Right.

53:42.152 --> 53:43.288
Well, I'm actually heading over

53:44.422 --> 53:45.423
to a mutual friend's
house, so, ah

53:47.292 --> 53:47.925
ask him for a little
bit more time.

53:49.093 --> 53:49.894
Zane's next show is in

53:49.894 --> 53:51.396
three days.

53:51.396 --> 53:52.763
If he's not there,
neither are you.

53:53.964 --> 53:54.632
I got it.

53:55.666 --> 53:56.667
And just to be clear.

53:57.968 --> 53:58.669
I mean you'll be fired.

54:00.605 --> 54:01.906
Thank you for clearing that up.

54:08.379 --> 54:09.013
(SIGH)

54:11.316 --> 54:12.550
More pressure, Olga, please.

54:14.184 --> 54:14.819
(SIGH)

54:20.791 --> 54:21.926
Well, that is one good
looking Christmas tree.

54:23.328 --> 54:23.861
Thanks for doing this.

54:24.495 --> 54:25.029
You're welcome

54:26.163 --> 54:28.533
Oh, also, ah, about earlier...

54:29.700 --> 54:31.569
When we got decorations
at my mom's gallery?

54:32.169 --> 54:32.737
No, after that.

54:33.871 --> 54:34.705
Oh, when you opened
a bottle of wine?

54:35.373 --> 54:35.940
Before that.

54:37.074 --> 54:39.377
Oh, when you tried to kiss me?

54:39.377 --> 54:40.811
Oh, you leaned in too.

54:41.379 --> 54:42.046
(LAUGHS)

54:43.548 --> 54:44.649
Anyway, I'm sorry if I was
a little too forward.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.752
No, that's fine.
I just...

54:48.986 --> 54:49.987
don't date.

54:52.357 --> 54:53.391
Quinn told me about her father.

54:55.860 --> 54:56.727
Yeah.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.599
When we said til
death do us part I

55:04.001 --> 55:05.035
didn't think it
would be so soon.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.841
The hardest part is having
to explain it to Quinn.

55:12.410 --> 55:13.444
I can't imagine.

55:15.880 --> 55:16.981
But, that's not
why I don't date.

55:18.483 --> 55:21.686
I'm just...busy,
following my dreams.

55:23.921 --> 55:24.589
What about you?

55:26.491 --> 55:28.926
You got your dream
and walked away?

55:30.395 --> 55:32.463
Well, being famous
was never my dream.

55:33.698 --> 55:34.732
Just something that
sort of happened.

55:37.301 --> 55:41.406
Seems like fame was
more of a dream

55:41.406 --> 55:42.540
for everyone else around me.

55:45.576 --> 55:46.477
What is your dream?

55:50.415 --> 55:51.048
Tell you another time.

55:52.417 --> 55:53.851
Ooooh, mysterious.

55:55.219 --> 55:56.687
Well, I got to save something
for our next non-date.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.858
You think there's going
to be another non-date?

56:00.858 --> 56:01.592
Well, maybe.

56:04.228 --> 56:04.795
What would we do?

56:06.897 --> 56:07.565
Hmmm.

56:09.199 --> 56:09.900
Teach you how to play guitar.

56:12.537 --> 56:14.705
Ah, actually, there's
one right there.

56:15.473 --> 56:16.441
Have you ever played?

56:17.307 --> 56:20.445
No, I have zero musical ability.

56:21.746 --> 56:23.147
Well maybe you just haven't
had the right teacher.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.489
All right.

56:31.489 --> 56:32.122
(STRUMS THE GUITAR)

56:33.123 --> 56:34.058
(GUITAR PLAYING)

56:41.365 --> 56:41.899
Scootch over.

56:49.474 --> 56:50.675
Now.
Let's see

56:52.176 --> 56:53.478
I think we can start
with a G chord. So...

56:55.045 --> 56:57.181
The G, you want to put your
middle finger right here.

56:59.750 --> 57:00.618
And your index there.

57:02.186 --> 57:03.087
Ring finger way down there.

57:04.021 --> 57:04.722
And squeeze hard and strum it.

57:06.056 --> 57:07.525
(GUITAR STRUM)

57:07.525 --> 57:08.693
Hey, you made a new chord.

57:09.126 --> 57:10.394
(LAUGHS)

57:10.394 --> 57:12.497
Ah, yeah, squeeze tight.

57:13.263 --> 57:13.831
Right there, yeah.

57:17.568 --> 57:18.135
(GUITAR STRUM)

57:19.236 --> 57:21.071
Hey, and there's your first G.

57:39.423 --> 57:39.924
I should be getting home.

57:41.592 --> 57:42.092
I wanna tuck Quinn in.

57:43.293 --> 57:43.928
I understand.

57:45.696 --> 57:46.764
Come on, I'll walk
you to the door.

58:01.378 --> 58:01.912
Free tomorrow?

58:02.913 --> 58:03.548
Yeah.

58:04.348 --> 58:04.815
Is it okay if I call you?

58:06.150 --> 58:06.651
I'd like that.

58:07.351 --> 58:07.918
All right.

58:09.253 --> 58:10.555
Say good night to Quinn for me.

58:10.988 --> 58:11.689
I'll do.

58:29.473 --> 58:30.274
Hi Jolene.

58:32.042 --> 58:32.677
Hey Billy.

58:33.911 --> 58:35.112
I'm, ah, I'm looking for Zane.

58:36.981 --> 58:38.616
I don't know what to tell you.
I haven't seen him.

58:40.017 --> 58:40.818
Give me a break.

58:41.852 --> 58:42.653
Listen, I just need
to talk to him.

58:43.420 --> 58:44.589
I'd love to help you but

58:45.590 --> 58:46.757
I haven't seen Zane
since last year.

58:48.258 --> 58:49.259
I can give you his
number if you like.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.096
I have his number, Jolene.

58:53.631 --> 58:54.599
He just hasn't picked
up in a few days.

58:55.966 --> 58:58.235
Did you ever think that if
you can't get a hold of him

58:58.235 --> 58:59.970
that maybe he doesn't
want to talk to you?

59:02.673 --> 59:03.674
I thought we used
to be friends too.

59:07.311 --> 59:07.978
Billy!

59:09.113 --> 59:10.314
I'm sorry.

59:25.095 --> 59:25.796
Yeah?

59:27.131 --> 59:29.433
You want to know where
to find Zane Gunther?

59:29.433 --> 59:30.200
Yeah.
Do you know where he is?

59:31.201 --> 59:32.102
It'll cost you.

59:41.879 --> 59:44.348
Bug?
What are you doing here?

59:45.816 --> 59:47.017
Why do you have all that money?

59:48.719 --> 59:49.754
And I'm about to make a
whole lot more, too.

59:50.988 --> 59:51.656
What are you talking about?

59:52.923 --> 59:53.891
Hey, you wanna know
where Zane Gunther is?

59:54.458 --> 59:55.292
Bug, stop.

59:56.226 --> 59:56.894
What's it worth to you?

59:57.361 --> 59:58.095
Bug!

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.139
Well, well, well.

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:11.776
Took you long enough.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.178
I don't know why I didn't
think of this place first.

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:16.981
Yeah, me too.
Do you still have your key?

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:18.649
I thought you sold it.

01:00:19.383 --> 01:00:20.050
I was about to, but, ah

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:22.186
I just couldn't
pull the trigger.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:24.088
Too many good memories
in this town.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.957
Yeah well, in case
you don't recall

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:27.892
my times here weren't
as good as yours.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.061
Well, you didn't have an older
brother looking out for you.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.398
Older brother now?
That's good to know.

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:37.301
You weren't returning my calls,

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:38.669
so I thought you'd
walked away from me too.

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:41.271
I'm sorry, I'm just,
ah, needed some time.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.341
I don't know why you don't
think I want the best for you.

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:46.076
I know you do.
I just...

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:48.645
Look, I figured if I
kept you out of it,

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:49.346
they couldn't blame you.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.749
Yeah, well there's
no chance there.

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.219
Mary said if I don't bring you
back then I'm out of a job.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.187
Oh man.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.424
I don't know if I've
ever said this but

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:02.927
I don't really care
for her very much.

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:05.362
Yeah, well the truth is

01:01:06.964 --> 01:01:07.998
I didn't come looking
for you to save a job.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:10.267
I know.

01:01:11.736 --> 01:01:12.937
I'm all right.
Okay.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:21.411
So your fans are
as rabid as ever.

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:26.116
She's not a fan.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:28.352
Hey, whoa!
What's wrong?

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:29.887
I didn't say anything.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:32.322
I think he saw something, or
said something to somebody.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:34.258
Slow down.
Who saw something?

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:36.093
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:01:41.766 --> 01:01:42.432
Oh no.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:46.270
We have to go.

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:50.775
Stay back!
Just stay back!

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:54.812
Miss, how does it
feel to ruin music?

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:56.446
Everybody back up right now.

01:01:57.782 --> 01:01:59.016
Zane, is she your girlfriend?

01:02:00.985 --> 01:02:01.986
Everybody, we'll have
time to talk later.

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:06.156
(YELLING)

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:15.032
Jeannette!
Wait, wait. Look.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:16.934
I need to get out
of here for a while

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:20.938
I'm hoping you and Quinn
might come with me.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.008
Zane I can't just uproot
my and Quinn's life.

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:26.944
Look it would just be for a bit.

01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:29.113
My brother's got a
condo in the city.

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:30.047
We can stay there until this
whole thing blows over.

01:02:31.816 --> 01:02:33.150
I mean who knows, maybe you and
Quinn might like it there.

01:02:34.819 --> 01:02:35.485
And what happens after that?

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.023
We can't just run
away from this.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:40.825
Look being with you

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:43.393
has been the realest thing
I've felt in a long time.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.397
Zane, I don't have the
luxury of just taking off.

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:51.135
My life is here.
I have responsibilities.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.139
What happens if you
change your mind,

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.207
meet someone better?

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:00.377
Now, what kind of person
do you think I am?

01:03:01.846 --> 01:03:02.546
That's just it.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:06.250
I honestly don't know.

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:12.522
Can you stand here
and promise me that

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.892
if I uproot my daughter

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.928
we're all going to live
happily ever after?

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:20.164
No.

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:22.132
No I can't.

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:24.869
I can't promise you anything.

01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:27.471
But I'm standing
here in front of you

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:30.274
begging you to come with me.
And that's not nothing.

01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:32.943
No.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:35.145
It's not.

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:38.415
If it were just me, I'd
already be packed.

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:41.551
But when it comes to what I want

01:03:42.887 --> 01:03:43.487
and Quinn needs...

01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:48.592
It's just what's best for her
every day of the week.

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:53.898
Family.

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:57.467
You asked me before
what my dream was.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:01.605
It was never the
music or the fame.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.975
All I wanted was a family.

01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:07.978
That would have been enough.

01:04:10.114 --> 01:04:11.181
I'm not giving up on us.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:16.286
I know.

01:04:19.723 --> 01:04:20.390
I am.

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:36.540
And the riddle for Where in
the world is Zane Gunther?

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:38.575
has been solved,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:40.444
Just as another starts.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.347
Everyone wants to know
who is this Jeannette Williams

01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:46.583
and what do I have to do
to switch places with her?

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:50.020
Right, I mean this simple
small town single mom

01:04:50.955 --> 01:04:52.056
has been swept off her feet.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:55.559
Now the question is,
is she an undercover princess?

01:04:57.694 --> 01:04:58.562
What's an undercover princess?

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:02.166
And to top things off

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.469
his latest album this
summer has mixed reviews--

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:09.039
I'm sure there's
something better

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:10.540
you can do with your time.

01:05:12.977 --> 01:05:13.677
What?
You're not talking to me now?

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:17.681
Okay.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.152
Well I was looking for
someone to share candy with.

01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:26.356
They said you made him leave.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.496
I liked him.
He was nice to us.

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.365
Well Quinn, sometimes liking
someone isn't enough.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.402
He was my friend.
And you ruined it.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:44.474
I think you can spend the
rest of the day in your room.

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:47.011
Fine.

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:48.612
(INDISTINCT YELLING)

(YELLING THROUGH DOOR)

01:05:50.914 --> 01:05:51.581
Go away!

01:05:53.017 --> 01:05:54.351
Oh, okay.
What's happening?

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:56.653
It's all right.
I've got this.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.389
I have to go to work.
I sent Quinn to her room.

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:02.392
Ladybug, it's going
to be all right.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:03.293
Do you want me to talk to her?

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:05.495
Honestly mom, do
whatever you want.

01:06:08.165 --> 01:06:10.100
They're saying that
he's back on tour

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.668
and playing down in
the city tonight.

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:12.636
Yeah, he's probably got a few
new girlfriends already.

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:14.671
Well, I've gotta
get back to work.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:17.041
Don't worry buddy,
I got this one.

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:18.608
You never pay.

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:27.051
Hey, there she is.

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:28.485
Zane's other woman.

01:06:29.186 --> 01:06:30.287
Please, no more.

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:33.423
I got it bad enough
from the reporters.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:34.124
Yeah, it looks like he
left you both behind.

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:35.259
Heck of a guy.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.095
Well since I imagine you guys

01:06:38.095 --> 01:06:38.562
are going to hear
about it soon enough.

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:40.530
Hear what?

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:41.565
Nothing.
It's just maybe...

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.501
I might of exaggerated a little
bit about being with Zane.

01:06:45.169 --> 01:06:47.237
You don't say.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:48.205
Well I for one am blown
away by this news.

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:49.573
So you weren't dating Zane?

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:51.608
Not in a typical sense, no.

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:53.110
Patty!

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.512
Okay.
You got me.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:56.480
No dating. No nothing.
All right.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:58.582
I got his autograph
and took a picture.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:01.085
You happy?
Patty's a loser.

01:07:01.985 --> 01:07:02.652

are so in love.

Thank you Jolene.
And it is gorgeous in here.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.667
Jeannette, can you
get up there please?

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:28.537
Jeannette?

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:32.309
Don't tell me I've lost you too.

01:08:33.277 --> 01:08:34.310
I couldn't take that today.

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:35.779
Sorry.
I'll get right on it.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:37.781
Look.

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:39.549
Don't worry about it.

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:42.551
The lights will still be
messed up in five minutes.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.191
How are you holding up?

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:50.627
Good.

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.895
Uh hmm.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:58.268
Not good.

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:04.341
Even us tough girls get our
hearts broken sometimes.

You didn't blow it.

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.386
It's not an easy choice.

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.389
Anyone can make an easy choice.

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:24.394
Do you think I should
have gone with him?

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.533
You're a mom.
And a damn good one.

01:09:31.435 --> 01:09:33.703
And you're always going to put

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:34.837
that sweet little girl's
needs above your own.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:41.545
Would you have gone with him?

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.314
Oh, in a heartbeat.

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:49.553
But, you know, I'm
a terrible mom.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:51.255
No you're not.

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:53.957
I cannot tell you
with any certainty

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:56.159
where my kids are right now.

but I truly have no idea.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:07.404
You're going to be okay.

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:15.645
Listen, this is going to
be a quick meet and greet.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.248
Maybe a couple of hand
shakes with execs.

01:10:20.284 --> 01:10:21.285
Honestly, I cannot
tell them apart

01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:23.353
so don't look at
me for any names.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:29.993
Then I was thinking
maybe we should, ah

01:10:31.395 --> 01:10:32.996
run down to Mexico,
maybe rob a bank?

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:35.465
Kind of a bucket list
thing, you know?

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:36.900
Yeah, sure.

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:41.871
Zane, why don't we just stop
the car and turn around?

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:45.275
Really.
I mean, why are we doing this?

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:46.943
She said she gave up.

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:54.384
