00:40.791 --> 00:43.502
<i>Everyone's heard of the city</i>
<i>that never sleeps.</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:46.046
<i>What about the mothers who never sleep</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:50.175
<i>because their boys move to the city</i>
<i>and never call?</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:55.264
<i>This is a story about three such mothers</i>
<i>and their three sons.</i>

00:55.556 --> 00:57.349
Stop the cab!

00:58.642 --> 00:59.476
Look where we are.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.436
You guys are such profound assholes.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.565
-It's time, Daniel.
-All right, I know. I'm still deciding.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.942
-You decided, you got a ring.
-Yes.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.527
-You're getting engaged!
-Yes.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.112
-Right now?
-Isn't that fantastic?

01:10.195 --> 01:13.907
I'm not asking Erin to marry me tonight,
drunk with girls in the car. No offense.

01:13.991 --> 01:17.035
-I mean, no, we're going to Matt's.
-D, I love you, but get out.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.496
-Come on.
-Bye.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.414
Come on.

01:20.998 --> 01:21.832
Look...

01:22.791 --> 01:24.543
You are happy with Erin.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.296
Like, happier than I've seen you since...

01:28.005 --> 01:29.131
sixth grade.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.301
You said you'd have your first novel
finished by the end of the year,

01:32.384 --> 01:33.927
three ends-of-the-years ago.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.929
-Horrible pep talk.
-These are the facts.

01:36.013 --> 01:39.391
-She's hot. I'm gonna do it if you don't.
-That's a better pep talk.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.642
-Erin!
-All right.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.352
Baby! Erin!

01:43.312 --> 01:44.146
This, by the way,

01:44.229 --> 01:46.857
-is why we don't all hang out anymore.
-Listen to me, okay?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.609
This will be romantic.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.653
This is the story
that she's gonna tell your kids.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.574
She's gonna say, "That's the night
that he stormed up the stairs,

01:55.949 --> 01:57.618
and got down on one knee..."

01:58.368 --> 02:00.662
and you asked if she would marry you.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.874
That is novel material.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.167
Novel material.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.710
Ah, yeah.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.254
It would be a pretty great story.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.885
<i>We were there for every big life event,</i>

02:15.344 --> 02:18.430
<i>and now we're lucky</i>
<i>if we hear about anything at all.</i>

02:29.691 --> 02:30.692
Erin!

02:32.402 --> 02:33.403
Daniel?

02:36.198 --> 02:37.074
What the fuck?

02:38.950 --> 02:41.244
<i>There's a lot you don't know as mothers.</i>

02:41.328 --> 02:43.330
<i>In fact, that's what bonded us</i>

02:43.413 --> 02:46.124
<i>when the boys' friendship</i>
<i>launched our friendship</i>

02:46.208 --> 02:48.835
<i>on a playground in Poughkeepsie.</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:04.476
<i>We've been through so much together.</i>

03:04.768 --> 03:06.311
<i>Graduations, proms,</i>

03:06.395 --> 03:09.147
<i>skinned knees, emergency room visits, </i>

03:09.231 --> 03:12.401
<i>family vacations, bad days, bad jobs,</i>

03:12.484 --> 03:15.987
<i>and at every scary and unfamiliar stage,</i>

03:16.071 --> 03:19.241
<i>the answer was always "friends".</i>

03:23.829 --> 03:24.913
<i>That's Gillian.</i>

03:24.996 --> 03:26.915
<i>She still has kids in the house,</i>

03:27.457 --> 03:28.834
<i>they're just not hers.</i>

03:29.584 --> 03:30.836
Why are you teaching today?

03:32.337 --> 03:33.714
It's just one lesson.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.924
He wants to play this later
for his mother.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.259
He still likes her.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.969
Daniel texted you already.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.472
Nothing says "I don't want to talk to you"
like a text.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.307
He said he misses us.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.350
That's nice.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.352
It's a lie.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.229
But it's a nice lie.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.861
<i>And that's Helen.</i>

03:56.319 --> 03:57.612
<i>She never ages.</i>

03:58.280 --> 03:59.740
<i>At least, not publicly.</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:05.537
Frank, I have to run a few errands
before I go to Carol's.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.332
Would you tell her I could sell her house
tomorrow if she'd give me the listing?

04:09.875 --> 04:12.127
Are you spray-painting
the top of your head again?

04:12.210 --> 04:14.588
I'm tall enough, so no one even sees it.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.173
Unless you're sitting.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.675
Carol talks a good game, Frank,

04:18.759 --> 04:21.136
but she will never sell that house.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.054
You'd have to sell it with her in it.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.934
<i>The three of us don't see each other</i>
<i>as often as we used to.</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:29.394
<i>The boys are gone,</i>

04:29.478 --> 04:31.480
<i>husbands have come and gone,</i>

04:31.563 --> 04:34.941
<i>but one tradition remains.</i>

04:36.067 --> 04:39.321
-Oh, I'm so glad we're still doing this!
-Happy Mother's Day!

04:39.404 --> 04:42.324
Without husbands and kids,
it might actually be fun.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.909
I brought donuts.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.870
I brought bourbon.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.706
Like I'm really gonna drink a mimosa?
It's Mother's Day.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.208
I knew I should have Ubered.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.504
Guys, I think the guy at the liquor store
was flirting with me.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.757
Oh, I can't remember the last time
someone flirted with me.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.343
I bet it happens all the time.
You're not flirting back.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.512
Why do you flirt back? You're married.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.680
My marriage isn't as perfect
as yours, Gillian.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.892
Besides, flirting isn't cheating.
It's a pick-me-up for your ego.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.437
-It keeps you in shape, sexually speaking.
-Oh, so it's sexercise.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.523
Yes, women should sexercise daily.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.442
Terrific, another thing
that I'm not doing.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.862
Come on, there's nothing you're not doing.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.614
Look at this spread.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.783
And you're always volunteering.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.495
Oh, please, I teach art
in a retirement home two days a week.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.121
I'm hardly Mother Teresa.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.249
And look at your house, it's spotless.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.917
A key to a clean house?

05:34.251 --> 05:35.418
Dead husband.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.673
Oh, God, that came out much darker
than I intended.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.175
No, that's a great household tip.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.513
What is with these flowers?

05:46.596 --> 05:49.516
Come on, they get bigger every year.
Did Matt send these?

05:49.599 --> 05:51.685
Yes, delivered this morning.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.521
Matty is the perfect son,
he never forgets.

05:54.938 --> 05:55.981
Is he dating anyone?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.399
He doesn't have time.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.318
He's helping to launch
some new sports magazine.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.363
So he just works, works out, and sleeps,
so he says.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.116
Paul is the same way,
he never mentions dating anyone.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.619
God, I wish Daniel would date someone
other than that Erin.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.622
She's not good enough for him.
I told him that.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.207
And how did that go?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.334
He unfriended me.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.254
See? Now, that's why I'm not on Facebook.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.717
-Remember how cute they were?
-Remember how cute we were?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.385
When did I turn 50?

06:25.468 --> 06:29.097
Oh, several years after I did,
so shut up and enjoy your youth.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.683
I love that with us,
we don't have to lie about our age.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.436
I love with us,
we don't have to lie about anything.

06:35.186 --> 06:38.315
Look, I've just I just polished off
a whole donut in front of you two.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.775
I didn't even pretend to only want half.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.444
Come on, that's friendship.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.487
You are so right.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.911
I sent myself the flowers.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.793
Been doing it for a while now.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.005
And each year, it gets
more and more depressing,

07:02.088 --> 07:03.882
so I get bigger and bigger flowers.

07:05.926 --> 07:06.760
Well...

07:07.385 --> 07:09.721
But you don't include a note, do you?

07:10.513 --> 07:11.431
No!

07:11.514 --> 07:13.266
I would not write my own...

07:14.476 --> 07:15.352
Yes.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.355
What did the note say this year?

07:19.397 --> 07:21.274
You are the best mother ever.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.484
Yes.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.735
Well, you are.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.737
What son forgets Mother's Day?

07:25.820 --> 07:28.448
Well, what kind of son
sends a Mother's Day text?

07:28.782 --> 07:29.908
Pass the bourbon.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.620
Come on, lazy! Buy me some bath salts.
Is that so difficult?

07:34.037 --> 07:37.457
-A candle, a frame, something.
-I should've sent myself flowers.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.375
It's brilliant.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.585
Daniel can't call me
from Long Island City?

07:40.669 --> 07:42.879
God, I have a girl for him to meet.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.173
The little jerk won't even call me back.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.342
Paul stopped caring when I married Frank.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.886
Matt hasn't been home
since Finn's funeral.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.596
And he barely came home for that.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.015
Stayed 16 hours, and he wore sneakers.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.184
They were nice ones. They were Gucci.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.521
What did we do wrong?

08:00.105 --> 08:02.774
We did everything right.
That's what we did wrong.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.153
I mean, we raised our children
to be free-thinking, independent beings,

08:07.237 --> 08:09.447
and now, they just...
they don't need us anymore.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.075
Well, they're gonna need us again
when they have kids,

08:12.158 --> 08:15.286
-when we're grandmothers.
-I don't want to be a grandmother, but...

08:15.578 --> 08:17.455
I would like one Mother's Day card.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.208
Motherhood.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.337
That sinking feeling that,
as your child's growing up,

08:24.421 --> 08:28.216
that you're being broken up with,
on a gradual but daily basis.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.094
It's inhumane emotional waterboarding.

08:32.095 --> 08:35.348
That is the best description of motherhood
I have ever heard.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.935
Well, at this stage,
it doesn't feel like motherhood,

08:39.019 --> 08:40.270
it feels like "otherhood."

08:40.812 --> 08:42.480
Oh, my God, you're so right.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.315
I don't want to be an "other."

08:44.399 --> 08:46.943
Me neither. But what are we gonna do?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.779
Drive to Manhattan,
storm their apartments?

08:49.863 --> 08:52.073
No, we've got to respect their space,

08:52.657 --> 08:54.367
let them individuate,

08:54.451 --> 08:56.369
blah, blah, blah.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.538
Except...

08:59.622 --> 09:01.166
it's fucking Mother's Day.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.302
-Come on, Carol, we're doing this!
<i>-Vámonos.</i>

09:13.428 --> 09:15.138
Let's go.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.059
All set.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.560
See you!

09:20.810 --> 09:22.353
I need some grown-up luggage.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.731
This is  my good luck bag from Guatemala.

09:25.106 --> 09:25.940
Here we go!

09:48.755 --> 09:49.798
Walk on boots.

09:49.881 --> 09:50.965
Hear us, boys?

09:51.049 --> 09:53.259
We should go on <i>America's Got Talent.</i>

09:57.305 --> 09:59.390
What was wrong with the old bridge?

10:02.685 --> 10:04.354
She was sagging...

10:05.021 --> 10:06.106
a little.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.796
I think the bourbon just wore off.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.798
Have we really thought this through?

10:31.881 --> 10:33.633
What if the boys don't want to see us?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.302
"Mother" is not just a noun, it's a verb.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.263
It requires action.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.848
I read that some place.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.475
-Well, I teach on Tuesday.
-Just call in sick.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.186
That's what I did
for the first time in... ever.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.147
I brought five clean pairs of underwear.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.524
Hey, I might be sick all week.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.276
All week?

10:51.609 --> 10:53.111
Well, how long are we staying?

10:53.194 --> 10:55.029
Until we feel like mothers again.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.490
Why can't we feel like mothers
from a hotel room?

10:57.574 --> 10:59.367
Now, that is a valid question.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.453
Because we're not on vacation,
we are on a mission.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.165
They can deal with having us
in their homes for a few days.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.292
They were in ours for 18 years.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.254
You got this, champ!

11:11.337 --> 11:13.214
Go in and call us when you're in!

11:13.298 --> 11:15.800
-Gillian, I can't do this, I can't!
-Oh, you'll be fine.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.385
-It's gonna be really great.
-No.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.971
You're going to live out this day.
You are.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.598
Don't take no for an answer.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.057
Make him love you!

11:23.141 --> 11:25.977
Helen! Gillian! Wait!

11:34.110 --> 11:34.944
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:35.028 --> 11:37.071
Hi, I just happened to be
in the neighbor--

11:38.281 --> 11:40.074
I'm downstairs. It's your mo--

12:00.303 --> 12:01.137
Mom.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.141
-What are you--
-I was just missing you today.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.810
Shit, it's Mother's Day.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.230
-Is it?
-I was gonna call.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.272
Can I come in?

12:11.606 --> 12:13.775
Yeah. Of course. Please.

12:13.858 --> 12:14.692
Please.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.739
I sent the elevator.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.741
It's just five floors.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.370
Well, can I get you something?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.664
Well, you didn't even hug me.

12:28.706 --> 12:29.749
I...

12:30.917 --> 12:32.335
You caught me off guard.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.924
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.969
-Let's just sit.
-Yeah.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.013
Let's just put this over here.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.431
That's gone.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.475
Good, let me just set that up.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.146
Just...

12:53.523 --> 12:54.607
That's not even...

13:05.576 --> 13:08.121
I've been thinking about our relationship,

13:08.663 --> 13:10.081
and I...

13:13.543 --> 13:15.003
I don't think we have one.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.963
What? Mom.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.340
Mom, you are my mom.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.758
How could we not have one?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.093
What's my favorite flower?

13:23.970 --> 13:25.263
We have a relationship.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.098
Then tell me something about me.

13:27.181 --> 13:30.101
Okay, there are a thousand things
that I know about you.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.352
Irises.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.063
I knew that.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.943
I want to stay for a few days.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.612
What? No. Mom. I mean, why?

13:41.696 --> 13:44.574
Because you still live
like a 15-year old, sweetheart.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.700
I mean, look!

13:46.075 --> 13:47.452
Look at this mess.

13:47.702 --> 13:52.123
I'll clean while you think of ten things
that you honestly know about me.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.333
Okay, Mom. Ten?

13:54.250 --> 13:56.169
It's gonna take days to get this in shape.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.254
Mom, I have a woman for that.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.341
Well, how often does she come?
Biannually?

14:50.431 --> 14:51.891
<i>Hey, it's Daniel Lieberman.</i>

14:51.974 --> 14:53.935
<i>I'm guessing you know what to do.</i>

15:04.570 --> 15:06.114
Oh, gosh.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.492
Did you get in?

15:09.575 --> 15:10.410
Yeah.

15:10.785 --> 15:11.619
I got in.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.454
Tell me something.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.456
Does Paul have drapes?

15:15.540 --> 15:20.211
Matt has 75 pairs of brand new sneakers,
but no drapes.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.755
Yes, Paul has drapes.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.340
Listen...

15:26.092 --> 15:28.094
Would you mind
if I called you back tomorrow?

15:28.177 --> 15:29.804
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.222
Enjoy!

15:31.305 --> 15:33.516
Okay. Yeah, I will. Goodnight, honey.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.775
Just stop.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.531
I'm a coward. Okay.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.449
Hey!

15:49.782 --> 15:50.741
Hey.

15:50.825 --> 15:51.659
Thank you.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.286
How's it going with Paul?

15:53.369 --> 15:54.203
<i>Good.</i>

15:54.287 --> 15:57.582
<i>Paul has been very gracious.</i>

15:58.374 --> 16:00.084
He just poured me a drink.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.170
<i>Well, how's it going with Daniel?</i>

16:02.253 --> 16:04.130
I'm gonna go by in the morning.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.758
Daniel's not answering the phone.
I think he's got that caller ID thing.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.970
<i>But I'll tell you this,</i>
<i>Long Island City is the place to go</i>

16:11.053 --> 16:12.597
<i>if you want to be stabbed.</i>

16:13.181 --> 16:15.725
<i>'Cause I was terrified</i>
<i>to get out of my car.</i>

16:16.100 --> 16:20.021
Hey, have you heard of this place,
the Hudson Hotel?

16:20.438 --> 16:21.981
<i>It's where Joel got the best rate.</i>

16:22.064 --> 16:23.858
Oh, yeah. It's supposed to be cool.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.109
<i>It's really cool.</i>

16:25.193 --> 16:27.820
<i>I mean, it's more like a club</i>
<i>than a hotel.</i>

16:29.947 --> 16:32.408
The bellboys are gorgeous.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.036
<i>Gillian, you scamp.</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:39.582
I'm gonna ambush Daniel when it's light.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.000
Listen...

16:41.792 --> 16:44.003
It is okay that you decided to wait.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.631
It's a difficult thing to do.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.758
I don't blame you.

16:50.009 --> 16:50.885
Actually...

16:51.677 --> 16:52.553
I've...

16:54.805 --> 16:56.265
-I...
-<i>Oh, hey.</i>

16:56.349 --> 16:58.267
<i>Can you tell Paul that I say hi?</i>

16:59.936 --> 17:01.521
Gillian says hello.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.940
Paul says hello back.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.400
<i>-Well, all right, sweet dreams.</i>
-Okay.

17:06.484 --> 17:07.401
<i>Night, hun.</i>

17:07.485 --> 17:08.528
Good night.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.725
I found some sausages in your freezer.

17:39.809 --> 17:43.521
Took the skillet I gave you
for college graduation out of the box.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.148
Well, I don't eat breakfast.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.359
You used to eat breakfast.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.403
"Most important meal of the day."

17:50.653 --> 17:52.154
Yeah, according to Dad,

17:52.238 --> 17:54.198
and whoever said it originally.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.034
Probably someone involved
in the cereal business.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.790
I need to get dressed and get to work.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.792
Oh, well, don't let me stop you.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.462
Those banana pancakes?

18:11.132 --> 18:13.342
Well, I guess... one...

18:14.010 --> 18:14.927
wouldn't kill me.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.481
-It's after eight. You're late.
-Hi...

18:27.565 --> 18:30.026
Touch anything on my desk,
you're fired. Understand?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.819
-I'm here to see Paul.
-He'll pay you.

18:31.902 --> 18:32.945
Andre!

18:33.029 --> 18:34.280
-Don't mess up.
-Okay.

18:43.956 --> 18:44.790
Hi.

18:45.041 --> 18:45.875
Hi.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.501
You're the new housekeeper.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.296
I'm Paul's mother.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.010
-I'm Helen.
-Right, yeah, sorry.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.261
-Hi, I'm Andre.
-Hi.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.512
Nice to meet you.

18:58.596 --> 18:59.430
Are you...

18:59.513 --> 19:01.307
Are you... are you Paul's boyfriend?

19:03.851 --> 19:05.353
I'll see if he's dressed.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.146
I just made coffee.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.607
-I'd love some coffee.
-Please. Please, join me.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.406
Paul never officially came out to me,
you know.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.492
-So...
-Did you ever ask?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.496
It wasn't my place to ask.
It was his place to tell.

19:24.246 --> 19:28.793
I'm sure at some point he knew I knew,
but we never, you know, talked about it.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.962
Well, my parents are visually deaf.
I mean...

19:32.046 --> 19:32.880
hello.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.800
What do you do, Andre?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.219
As little as I can get away with.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.597
He never alters his pattern.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.975
I can tell by the creeks in the floor
when he's about to come downstairs.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.187
Oh, my God, I owe you a blow job.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.189
-Your mother.
<i>-Your </i>mother.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.691
Surprise!

19:53.401 --> 19:54.777
Hey, Mom!

19:55.528 --> 19:56.362
Boo!

19:57.405 --> 20:00.533
I know it doesn't make any sense for me
to try to maintain that house.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.535
It's in constant need of repairs,

20:02.618 --> 20:05.579
and no one's even been in the pool
since your father died.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.497
So, just sell it.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.666
-But we've been there for 20 years.
-I haven't.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.544
He didn't want me to be alone,
and I don't want to be, but...

20:12.044 --> 20:13.170
the mattress...

20:14.130 --> 20:16.298
it sags where your father slept.

20:17.091 --> 20:20.386
And I keep thinking, you know,
maybe I should just buy a new one.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.012
But if I did that, then...

20:23.139 --> 20:26.100
the mattress wouldn't sag
where your father slept.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.114
Well, that's a nice greeting
for your mother.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.117
What's a nice greeting?
I didn't say anything.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.536
That's what I'm talking about.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.999
-Are you and Dad fighting or something?
-I came to see if you were okay.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.084
I'm fantastic.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.462
You want a screwdriver or something?

20:54.545 --> 20:56.297
Are you trying to make me cry?

20:56.380 --> 20:59.258
Can you not threaten me with feelings, Ma?
Don't worry about me.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.969
Your life is your life and mine is mine.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.722
That's the stupidest thing I've heard.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.600
If everyone was here for themselves,
life would be pointless.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.310
Life is pointless.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.437
Children give your life meaning.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.814
You are the point of my life, Daniel.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.066
Please don't make me
question my existence.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.194
Oh, my God, Ma, what are you doing here?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.029
Really? That's where we are?

21:20.112 --> 21:22.072
I drive for hours and hours,

21:22.156 --> 21:24.575
the first thing you say is,
"What are you doing here?"

21:24.658 --> 21:27.161
It wasn't the first thing I said,
it was the last thing.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.414
Okay. I'll go.
If you don't want me, I'll go.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.792
-I'll get my bag.
-I'm not saying I don't want you,

21:32.875 --> 21:35.753
I'm wondering why you didn't call me
to tell me you were coming.

21:35.836 --> 21:39.715
You didn't call me on Mother's Day,
I'm not holding that against you.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.008
I texted you.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.218
I birthed you.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.595
Anyway, it's not why I'm here.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.931
I found you a nice Jewish girl.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.474
You weren't even Jewish.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.476
I converted, for you.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.353
Okay, you converted for Dad.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.897
Yes, so we could raise our kids as Jews.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.816
So, stop dating the <i>shiksas.</i>

21:58.734 --> 21:59.985
Are you talking about Erin?

22:00.069 --> 22:02.196
Erin. What kind of name is that?

22:02.279 --> 22:04.281
It's like the leftovers
of a Scrabble hand.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.784
That's a character flaw now, her name?

22:06.867 --> 22:08.953
You met her once.
You barely even spoke to her.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.081
-You never even gave her a chance.
-I saw her social media.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.916
A lot of margarita nights.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.918
-She's a drinker.
-I'm a drinker.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.046
You're a thinker. You use alcohol
as a coping mechanism.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.674
That's the definition of alcoholism.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.759
You're an intellectual,
she's a hairdresser.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.678
Hairstylist. And so what?

22:25.761 --> 22:29.181
So, let her style your hair,
but don't procreate with her.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.767
That is so classist and offensive.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.562
And it's over,
so why don't you just move on, okay?

22:34.645 --> 22:35.729
I have.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.691
Remember the Brimers?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.318
-Ivan and Joan.
-No.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.779
On the corner.
They had that horrible little Shih Tzu

22:43.863 --> 22:46.240
-that bit you when you were six.
-I remember the dog.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.952
Well, Joan's sister
has a nephew by marriage in Yonkers,

22:50.327 --> 22:53.581
and he gave me this number
of this brilliant woman from his temple.

22:53.664 --> 22:58.085
She's just been through a painful divorce,
which apparently was not her fault at all.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.420
Okay, good to know.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.422
And she is a beautiful person.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.049
-She's friends with his wife.
-Oh, my God, Ma,

23:04.133 --> 23:07.595
-you've never even met her, have you?
-I saw her social media.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.555
She is smart.

23:09.638 --> 23:10.973
She did a beach clean-up.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.559
She's starting to think
about dating again.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.311
We got to get in there fast.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.604
When I reached out to her,

23:16.687 --> 23:18.939
I told her you were nearby
and in a similar boat.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.859
-She said she'd love to hear from you.
-Why have you done this?

23:22.276 --> 23:24.028
Her name is Alison.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.489
She graduated from Brown,
she has a political science degree,

23:27.573 --> 23:29.074
she does something in television.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.367
Let me get this straight.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.369
You want me to go on a date
with this woman

23:32.453 --> 23:36.290
based on the fact that she attends temple
with some guy in Yonkers

23:36.582 --> 23:39.752
who's somehow related to the woman
whose dog bit me when I was a kid.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.129
You can't hold that horrible dog
against her.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.214
I'm not talking about the dog, Ma.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.508
I'm talking about your insanity.

23:47.801 --> 23:48.844
Good shot.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.347
Have you had a date
since you've lived here?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.515
I don't think this apartment
is helping at all.

23:53.599 --> 23:57.353
-It's like you're living in Gollum's cave.
-Okay, Ma, thanks for the dating advice.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.438
Please, just leave it. Please.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.483
I'm not leaving New York
until you call her.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.444
You can't force me
to go on a date with someone.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.113
I call it prodding, a gentle little nudge.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.783
Okay, I'll be back at supper time.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.118
I need my Mace and my keys.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.747
I'll be back... alive. Hopefully.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.173
Hi, is this Alison?

24:26.674 --> 24:27.800
It's...

24:28.384 --> 24:29.802
Daniel Lieberman.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.763
My mom said I should call you.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.891
So, Paul lives with his...

24:36.308 --> 24:38.602
-Andre?
-Yes, and some other people.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.146
It's kind of great.
It's sort of a group home for gays.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.565
There's an older Wall Street guy
that owns the place

24:43.649 --> 24:45.901
and a tiny man who is very abrupt.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.821
I told Andre I was gonna cook
for the whole gang tonight.

24:48.904 --> 24:49.989
You? Cooking?

24:50.656 --> 24:52.992
That's more shocking
than your son coming out.

24:53.075 --> 24:56.078
Well, apparently, he's been completely out
to everybody but me.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.956
-Oh, honey, he just assumed you knew.
-I did know.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.749
-Well, we all knew.
-No, I didn't.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.584
Why am I the last to get the memo?

25:02.668 --> 25:04.461
You're not. Larry is.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.589
He had one foot out of the door
by the time Paul was in high school.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.050
So, I thought, I'm gonna let him
find out by himself.

25:10.134 --> 25:14.263
You know, his only son. It's gonna drive
that closed-minded lying dickhead crazy.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.516
Oh, Larry.
Can we talk about something else?

25:17.766 --> 25:19.810
Absolutely. How's Daniel?

25:21.228 --> 25:24.064
It's worse than I imagined.
That's never happened to me before.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.774
I under-worry.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.736
Well, all the more reason
for you to leave your hotel

25:28.819 --> 25:31.488
and move in like Helen and I did.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.532
Yeah, I'm in a hotel, too.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.075
What?

25:35.159 --> 25:38.871
Yes, I know what I said,
but, you know, Paul's got his plate full

25:38.954 --> 25:41.373
and doesn't need a house guest
on top of it, you know?

25:41.457 --> 25:43.792
So, he forgot Mother's Day. Big deal.

25:43.876 --> 25:44.835
-Big deal?
-Yeah.

25:44.918 --> 25:47.337
What? You got me drunk
and made me come here.

25:47.421 --> 25:48.505
But seriously...

25:48.881 --> 25:51.425
how do you live in this town
and forget Mother's Day?

25:51.508 --> 25:54.595
Look. Mother, mom, mama,
<i>Mutter, madre, maman.</i>

25:55.971 --> 25:57.181
This is Joseph.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.641
Look at these cute bags. Let's go in.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.020
No. Paul does Joseph.
He did these windows.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.025
I am so moving in with that fucker.

26:14.073 --> 26:14.907
Hi.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.159
Are you the famous writer?

26:17.242 --> 26:19.953
Either my mom exaggerated,
or you're meeting someone else.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.206
-I'm Alison.
-Daniel.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.457
-Hello.
-Hi.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.126
You write for <i>The New Yorker,</i>
that's pretty famous.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.711
I don't write for <i>The New Yorker.</i>

26:27.795 --> 26:30.380
I thought your mom said
you did write for <i>The New Yorker.</i>

26:30.464 --> 26:34.384
<i>The New Yorker </i>published one short story
of mine four years ago, which...

26:35.302 --> 26:38.222
resulted in a very small book deal,
but as of yet, no book.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.640
The rest of my work,

26:39.723 --> 26:42.726
if you can call it that,
is in literary journals no one's heard of.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.853
-I might have heard of them.
-No, you haven't.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.063
Come on, tell me.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.316
<i>-The Willacoochee River Journal.</i>
-No.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.609
I know, it's funny, right?

26:50.692 --> 26:53.403
-You're making that up.
-I wish I could make that up.

26:53.487 --> 26:56.073
Sadly, that is non-fiction.
That is my life.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.117
My mom should talk less.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.411
Yeah, but if your mom talked less,
we wouldn't be here right now, so...

27:01.495 --> 27:03.622
you know, thank God for your mother,
right?

27:06.583 --> 27:07.459
<i>Daniel!</i>

27:08.502 --> 27:10.712
If you're there
and you're pretending you're not,

27:10.796 --> 27:12.381
I'm never talking to you again.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.258
Or maybe that's what you want.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.342
Daniel!

27:17.886 --> 27:18.720
What?

27:19.138 --> 27:22.224
Oh, God, this is totally unsafe.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.561
Oh, come on.

27:25.936 --> 27:26.812
Open?

27:34.862 --> 27:36.321
Come on, old girl.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.073
You still got it.

27:38.782 --> 27:39.700
Okay.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.748
Mice!

27:47.833 --> 27:49.334
So, you lived in New York?

27:49.418 --> 27:50.586
Did I ever.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.381
I worked in fashion at the time.
I met Paul's father at Studio 54.

27:54.798 --> 27:55.799
-No.
-Yeah.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.050
Fabulous.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.803
Yes, and ridiculous.
You're supposed to have sex

27:59.887 --> 28:02.764
with people you meet there,
do drugs with them, not marry them.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.934
I think Larry fell in love with me
for my looks

28:06.018 --> 28:08.520
and just tolerated me for everything else.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.523
Does that sound terribly vain?

28:12.024 --> 28:15.194
Look who you're talking to.
I'm window dressing for a window dresser.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.447
But you two are happy?

28:19.823 --> 28:20.657
Yeah.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.204
He says he'd like me to be
older or flabbier

28:25.287 --> 28:26.538
so when he leaves for work,

28:26.622 --> 28:29.208
he won't have to wonder
if I'll be here when he gets home.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.422
Since when is Paul so insecure?

28:38.008 --> 28:39.760
-He gets that from you.
-Yeah.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.389
You were...

28:45.891 --> 28:47.267
You were preoccupied

28:47.601 --> 28:50.729
between husbands, dating,
hosting charity events.

28:51.647 --> 28:52.648
I mean, look...

28:53.357 --> 28:55.067
You were hurt after the divorce.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.320
Right? Lost? I get that.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.490
But he felt a little abandoned.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.287
Well, he never told me that.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.039
Hey.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.542
-Hey!
-There he is.

29:12.876 --> 29:13.835
-Hi.
-Hey.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.838
Are you cooking?

29:16.922 --> 29:17.756
Well, yeah.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.344
I was falling out of love with him,

29:22.427 --> 29:25.555
but I thought I was falling out
of love with myself. Know what I mean?

29:25.931 --> 29:26.974
No, not really.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.058
Oh, okay.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.102
Think of yourself as an egg.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.354
-Okay, why?
-Because the egg is you, okay?

29:32.437 --> 29:35.399
It's your self-love, your self-worth.
You're the egg, right?

29:35.482 --> 29:39.152
So good love presses on the ends of you,
you know,

29:39.236 --> 29:41.655
but what happens when you press
on the ends of an egg?

29:41.947 --> 29:42.781
I don't know.

29:43.156 --> 29:46.034
Nothing. Good love challenges the egg,
puts pressure on the egg,

29:46.118 --> 29:47.744
but allows the egg to stay whole.

29:48.161 --> 29:51.373
But what does it take
to turn good love into bad love?

29:52.541 --> 29:53.709
An expiration date?

29:54.042 --> 29:56.837
No. The egg twists, okay? That's it.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.923
Now, suddenly,
the pressure is on the sides of the egg.

30:00.007 --> 30:03.468
-Okay? And then, what happens?
-We break the egg analogy?

30:03.552 --> 30:04.469
Oh, yeah.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.930
Yes, Daniel. It breaks, all right.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.474
So, who broke your egg, Daniel?

30:12.853 --> 30:14.354
<i>I waited five weeks.</i>

30:14.771 --> 30:16.023
To bang your trainer?

30:16.106 --> 30:17.107
Five weeks...

30:18.066 --> 30:19.026
without a word.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.612
I felt like you were happy
for the chance to walk away.

30:23.613 --> 30:24.448
I came...

30:25.115 --> 30:26.950
to tell you that I decided.

30:27.534 --> 30:31.788
I always thought I had to finish my novel
first or make something of my life,

30:31.872 --> 30:33.665
and then, I finally realized...

30:34.499 --> 30:36.209
all I ever wanted was you,

30:36.293 --> 30:38.253
and for us to be together, and...

30:39.546 --> 30:40.464
maybe we'll...

30:41.673 --> 30:43.008
one day have children.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.636
And that would be
the purpose of our lives,

30:46.720 --> 30:48.764
the best thing that we'd ever do.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.019
I was wrong.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.104
No.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.314
Daniel.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.066
Who broke your egg?

31:01.151 --> 31:02.069
Okay, look...

31:02.694 --> 31:04.071
-Alison.
-Yep.

31:04.154 --> 31:05.781
I'm here to get rid of my mother,

31:05.864 --> 31:08.116
and you're here
to talk about your ex-husband.

31:08.200 --> 31:12.079
So, why don't we just call it over easy
and be done with it?

31:12.162 --> 31:14.206
I'm gonna give you an answer
to that question,

31:14.289 --> 31:17.084
even though I don't think
you'll understand it,

31:17.167 --> 31:18.668
and I don't think you deserve it.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.754
-I'm telling you I don't deserve it.
-Okay.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.215
-You don't have to.
-You don't fix the egg.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.509
It doesn't matter who twisted it,
it's broken.

31:25.592 --> 31:26.885
And you gotta let it go.

31:26.968 --> 31:30.347
And once you've truly bid
that egg farewell, you'll...

31:30.639 --> 31:31.973
you'll find a new egg.

31:34.017 --> 31:34.851
Thank you.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.311
That was...

31:37.104 --> 31:38.647
I really need the check right now.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.358
I don't think I can hear about the egg
anymore. I'm sorry.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.568
All right. I was gonna split the bill
with you,

31:43.652 --> 31:45.320
but now I'm not so...

31:45.695 --> 31:46.530
thank you.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.573
Fair. Good luck with your egg hunt.

31:48.949 --> 31:49.783
Thank you.

31:54.204 --> 31:58.583
Well, I'm so glad we just finally get
to sit down and have a meal together.

31:59.501 --> 32:00.335
And...

32:01.420 --> 32:04.381
Did I mention that Paul
has never officially come out to me?

32:07.384 --> 32:08.510
Shame on you, Paul.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.847
You know, what is this bullshit
about having to come out?

32:11.930 --> 32:15.475
It's not like straight people have
to gather their families when they're 18

32:15.559 --> 32:19.312
and find a way to break it to them
they're heterosexual, thank you, so...

32:19.396 --> 32:20.939
why is it any different for us?

32:21.481 --> 32:24.317
Why can't parents just see what they see

32:24.401 --> 32:26.486
and figure it out for themselves?

32:27.112 --> 32:28.697
-It is not a sin.
-No.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.491
And it is not something I need to confess.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.203
Shut up and tell her.
She deserves the truth.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.497
Do it now! This is really good, Helen.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.169
-Mom.
-Yeah?

32:43.044 --> 32:44.004
I'm gay.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.047
You're what?

32:46.590 --> 32:48.300
I support you and I love you!

32:50.594 --> 32:51.428
I'm happy.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.804
All right, kiss her already.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.514
-No!
-I'm not gonna go kiss her.

32:54.598 --> 32:55.807
-Get up.
-Kiss your mother.

32:55.891 --> 32:59.769
Walk over to your mother
and kiss her the way you're supposed to.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.188
-Kiss.
-Here I come.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.524
Beautiful.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.277
You just made my night.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.572
Now all you have to do
is tell your father.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.949
I told him a long time ago.

33:13.825 --> 33:14.659
What?

33:16.036 --> 33:18.121
-I mean, a while ago.
-How long ago?

33:19.748 --> 33:21.416
I don't know. A few years.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.339
Why did you tell him and not me?

33:28.882 --> 33:30.175
I figured you knew.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.094
So...

33:33.178 --> 33:36.515
So, I'm punished for being perceptive.

33:36.598 --> 33:40.018
I would like to know why he got
to have the conversation and I didn't.

33:40.101 --> 33:43.271
Mom, you just forced me to come out
to three men who know I'm gay.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.815
No way that this moment
wasn't going to be about you.

33:45.899 --> 33:49.528
So, maybe this is the exact reason why.

33:49.945 --> 33:53.990
This has nothing to do
with you coming out to me. It's just...

33:54.366 --> 33:56.034
It has nothing to do with that.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.329
This is about how you treat me
and your father.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.957
I mean, is he always the one
that is going to be--

34:02.040 --> 34:04.167
Mom, there is no you and my father.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.669
You're divorced!

34:07.671 --> 34:10.507
There is me and him,
and there is me and you,

34:10.924 --> 34:12.717
but there is no you and him.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.011
And I am not willing to be
the you and the him,

34:15.095 --> 34:18.723
which is what you have always wanted,
which is why you are blowing up now.

34:19.099 --> 34:22.352
There is a me and him
because there is a you. And you...

34:22.811 --> 34:25.689
You are just like him.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.898
Exactly like he is!

34:26.982 --> 34:29.317
No, please do not compare me
to someone you despise.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.028
-How about that, huh?
-I gotta go make a phone call.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.453
I'll just go ahead and take this with me.

34:41.454 --> 34:42.747
Am I interrupting?

34:42.998 --> 34:45.125
<i>No, Daniel isn't home yet.</i>

34:45.750 --> 34:46.960
Neither is Matt.

34:47.627 --> 34:51.881
I feel like I'm being stood up
and all of Tribeca knows it.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.426
These windows.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.220
Oh, stop complaining.
I'm in a basement apartment.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.597
All I see are cockroaches

34:58.680 --> 34:59.723
<i>and feet.</i>

35:01.766 --> 35:04.978
I'll call you later
if there are any new developments.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.438
<i>All right. Good night. </i>

35:06.938 --> 35:07.939
Bye.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.775
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be. Nothing to be sorry about.

35:10.859 --> 35:14.362
-I get emotional.
-I know. Just give it a sec, okay?

35:15.822 --> 35:16.698
Andre said...

35:17.282 --> 35:19.576
that I ruined your life

35:19.659 --> 35:21.620
-and you hate me for it!
-That's...

35:21.703 --> 35:23.913
Helen! No! That's... no.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.332
-I...
-Yeah.

35:25.415 --> 35:26.249
No. I said--

35:26.333 --> 35:28.668
-It is. When I was chopping cucumbers.
-That's...

35:28.752 --> 35:32.380
I kind of said you have some abandonment
issues because of her. That's all.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.840
That's what you told...

35:35.759 --> 35:36.593
Okay.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.314
Mom.

35:50.106 --> 35:50.940
Yeah?

35:52.108 --> 35:52.942
Hey.

35:55.153 --> 35:55.987
Yeah?

35:56.363 --> 35:57.364
I love you.

35:59.741 --> 36:00.575
Mom.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.203
I would do anything for you,

36:03.745 --> 36:05.038
and you know that.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.751
I would like to stay here for a few nights
if that's all right.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.840
-Well, there's not really a guest room.
-It's okay.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.113
Plague?

37:29.664 --> 37:30.874
Matthew Walker.

37:31.458 --> 37:32.959
Dartmouth graduate.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.096
Something smells good.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.140
It smelled better at six.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.350
Mom!

38:31.017 --> 38:32.477
You were supposed to be gone!

38:32.894 --> 38:33.853
Who said that?

38:34.604 --> 38:36.397
I said, "Lock up when you leave."

38:36.981 --> 38:38.149
I didn't leave yet.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.735
Is this your...

38:41.110 --> 38:41.945
girlfriend?

38:42.028 --> 38:43.863
This is Angel.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.157
Angel, this is Mom.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.075
Hi.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.869
-How long have you two been together?
-A while.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.121
Been together about four months now.

38:53.748 --> 38:54.582
Wow!

38:54.999 --> 38:57.710
-Well, I'll make another plate.
-No. You don't need to!

38:57.794 --> 39:01.047
-Thank you, Mrs. Walker.
-You don't have to call her Mrs. Walker.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.842
Thank you... Mom?

39:05.885 --> 39:06.761
Wow!

39:15.144 --> 39:16.229
How the hell...

39:17.397 --> 39:18.273
Did she...

39:25.363 --> 39:28.032
Unbelievable. She just comes in and...

39:28.825 --> 39:29.951
makes her...

39:35.456 --> 39:36.541
No boundaries.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.254
So, what do you do, Angel?

39:42.630 --> 39:43.840
I'm still in school.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.843
Did Matt tell you
that he went to Dartmouth?

39:46.926 --> 39:47.760
No.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.387
That's amazing.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.474
I might take a year off to travel
before college,

39:54.142 --> 39:55.018
maybe go to Europe.

39:58.187 --> 39:59.480
So, you're...

39:59.772 --> 40:01.399
still in high school.

40:01.482 --> 40:02.483
You were in a bar.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.277
-I'm 18...
-You don't look it.

40:04.819 --> 40:05.653
Next month.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.489
-Seventeen.
-You never said that you were 17!

40:08.573 --> 40:11.117
Dating for four months,
you don't know how old she is?

40:11.200 --> 40:14.537
You forced me to lie. You make it sound
like I can't be in a relationship.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.289
-I didn't force you.
-I just met her.

40:16.372 --> 40:18.249
She was with friends drinking, I paid.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.168
I didn't come with you
because you paid.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.670
He asked me to model for his magazine.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.298
-Because you said that you were a model.
-I am.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.717
I used to model children's clothing.

40:28.051 --> 40:30.136
When was that? Last year?

40:30.219 --> 40:32.472
Okay, I think that you should go.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.808
Could you make sure
she gets into a cab, at least?

40:35.892 --> 40:38.061
Know what?
I'd love to put both of you in a cab.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.105
-It was nice to meet you.
-Good night, Angel.

40:42.899 --> 40:43.983
Happy Birthday!

40:44.359 --> 40:45.276
Next month.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.112
No.

41:06.005 --> 41:06.965
-Hey.
-Hi.

41:08.591 --> 41:09.425
Thank you.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.846
I wouldn't have yelled at her
if she were my mom.

41:14.681 --> 41:17.016
-You hate your mom.
-Because she yells at me.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.226
-Okay
-It's...

41:22.897 --> 41:25.483
-I will write her a note of apology.
-Thank you.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.902
And invite her to lunch,
where I'll apologize again.

41:28.528 --> 41:31.781
She doesn't really hear apologies
the first time through, so...

41:32.490 --> 41:33.366
Thank you.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.037
Do we have a cross I can nail the note to?

41:38.121 --> 41:39.747
-Please just write the note.
-Sure.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.629
Mom.

41:47.964 --> 41:51.801
-Mom, I said I have somebody for that.
-No, you said you'd do it.

41:54.137 --> 41:56.014
I'm sorry about last night.

41:56.097 --> 41:57.223
Why are you sorry?

41:58.099 --> 42:00.852
-Because it was embarrassing.
-No, it wasn't embarrassing.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.604
Statutory rape,
but let's not argue semantics.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.399
It's never happened to me before.
I mean, 17?

42:06.482 --> 42:08.317
-I am not interested, Matt.
-What?

42:08.401 --> 42:10.236
If you're gonna lie, I'm not interested.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.362
I'm not lying.

42:11.446 --> 42:14.615
I saw your magazine.
It is not about sports.

42:14.699 --> 42:15.700
I never said it was.

42:15.783 --> 42:19.245
You said you work for a men's magazine
called <i>All Balls.</i>

42:19.328 --> 42:21.080
What I was supposed to think, scrotum?

42:21.164 --> 42:24.542
A, that's not a word I need to hear
out of my mother's mouth, and B,

42:24.625 --> 42:26.085
you are not the demographic.

42:26.169 --> 42:29.088
Well, that much is clear.
So now I know the truth about you.

42:29.172 --> 42:32.383
My job has nothing to do
with that girl being underage. Young...

42:32.717 --> 42:34.761
younger than she has a right to be.

42:34.844 --> 42:36.637
So how old is she, do you think?

42:36.721 --> 42:38.473
-I don't know, Mom.
-You're the editor.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.891
I'm the art director.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.602
I design the look and the feel
of <i>All Balls.</i>

42:43.478 --> 42:44.771
The magazine.

42:44.854 --> 42:46.481
So it reflects your taste?

42:46.564 --> 42:48.441
It's my job, Mom.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.193
A job that I'm very good at.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.612
To tailor the content to our audience.

42:52.695 --> 42:55.990
And our audience happens to be young men,
and young men like young women.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.618
This is not a magazine
for under the mattress.

42:58.701 --> 43:01.621
We are <i>Vanity Fair </i>with half the brain
and twice the body.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.206
We are totally mainstream.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.167
Well, your father and I didn't raise you
to be mainstream.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.211
We raised you to be exceptional.

43:08.795 --> 43:11.547
-If your father were alive...
-What, he'd be disappointed?

43:11.839 --> 43:14.675
Because God forbid I haven't lived up
to his standards, right?

43:15.301 --> 43:16.677
But he's not here, Mom.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.430
So why are you still taking his side?

43:22.141 --> 43:23.768
What are you talking about?

43:25.812 --> 43:29.273
How come you never came
to any of my basketball games?

43:32.527 --> 43:34.195
That was your time with your father.

43:34.278 --> 43:37.448
He was the coach, you were the star.
I still have every trophy,

43:37.532 --> 43:40.576
and you have to know how proud I was
of every single win.

43:40.660 --> 43:41.786
What about when we lost?

43:41.869 --> 43:44.539
-You didn't lose very often.
-No, I didn't lose very often,

43:44.622 --> 43:47.041
because according to Dad,
failure wasn't an option.

43:47.583 --> 43:48.918
But apparently, now it is.

43:49.001 --> 43:52.505
-You are not a failure.
-Oh, no, I know that I'm not a failure.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.006
Why are you still lecturing me?

43:54.090 --> 43:56.384
I just want you to expect more
from your life.

43:56.467 --> 43:59.095
Make the most of your time on this planet.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.431
I'm not the one
still living in the same house!

44:11.274 --> 44:14.610
Ma, did you break into my apartment
and steal my vodka?

44:17.029 --> 44:17.989
Vodka?

44:18.865 --> 44:20.032
That's crazy talk.

44:21.534 --> 44:24.495
Hey, we were supposed to have dinner.
I baked you a pie.

44:24.579 --> 44:26.622
I was on your date last night.

44:26.831 --> 44:28.749
What? How was it?

44:29.083 --> 44:31.043
I'd rather be bitten by the dog again.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.715
I had such hopes
for that girl from Yonkers.

44:36.424 --> 44:39.635
You know, sometimes it's the second date
where the magic happens.

44:48.728 --> 44:50.897
You want to meet me at the Met after work?

44:51.397 --> 44:52.231
I can't.

44:52.607 --> 44:54.567
I have a party at 1 Oak tonight.

44:55.276 --> 44:58.154
A product launch for a shampoo/body wash.

44:58.237 --> 45:00.031
-Oh, are mothers invited?
-No.

45:00.448 --> 45:02.283
I mean, no, it's...

45:03.034 --> 45:05.244
It's guest list only,
and you've got to RSVP.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.165
It's not even a party.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.585
It's work, and I shouldn't have even said
that it was a party.

45:24.305 --> 45:25.723
It was good to see you, Mom.

45:26.057 --> 45:26.891
Love you.

45:27.683 --> 45:30.394
And if you decide to leave, just lock up.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.063
Like I said.

45:32.897 --> 45:33.898
I'm not leaving.

45:35.399 --> 45:36.234
Okay.

45:39.946 --> 45:40.863
Look.

45:40.947 --> 45:42.990
Oh, it has little bees.

45:43.866 --> 45:45.326
Oh, my God.

45:45.409 --> 45:46.702
Can you imagine?

45:46.786 --> 45:48.996
Isn't it fabulous?
It's sort of conservative.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.706
What do we know about this party?

45:50.790 --> 45:52.541
There's a list, apparently.

45:52.625 --> 45:53.709
For a shampoo?

45:55.461 --> 45:56.629
I feel naked.

45:57.964 --> 46:01.592
-Oh, my. Where have you been hiding those?
-I try to de-emphasize.

46:01.676 --> 46:04.053
Why? They're spectacular.

46:04.428 --> 46:06.013
Is this appropriate, you think?

46:06.097 --> 46:08.975
That dress
or crashing your son's work party?

46:09.308 --> 46:12.144
Matt brought home a girl
almost half his age.

46:12.228 --> 46:14.647
Well, Larry married a girl
almost half his age.

46:14.730 --> 46:15.940
It's just what men do.

46:17.692 --> 46:18.651
How about these?

46:19.694 --> 46:21.946
Matt, he doesn't listen to me anymore,

46:22.321 --> 46:24.740
so I'm trying to listen to him.

46:25.157 --> 46:29.120
I'm trying to understand his life here,
support what he wants.

46:29.537 --> 46:31.038
Is that going too far?

46:31.122 --> 46:32.039
No.

46:32.665 --> 46:35.001
-That is admirable.
-Yes.

46:35.543 --> 46:39.880
You should go to that party
and you should wear this fabulous dress.

46:40.589 --> 46:42.550
And we should get your hair done.

46:45.511 --> 46:46.429
That's her.

46:46.762 --> 46:49.390
-Okay, well, is she any good?
-I don't know.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.267
-Carol, it's time.
-Time for what?

46:51.350 --> 46:52.685
-A new look.
-Yeah.

46:52.768 --> 46:55.646
Now, come on.
I got to meet Paul for lunch at one.

46:57.189 --> 46:59.358
-Hi, I'm Erin.
-Hello.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.736
And I see you bought your girl--
Oh, my gosh.

47:02.611 --> 47:03.654
Mrs. Lieberman.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.866
How crazy. Erin.

47:06.949 --> 47:10.369
Yes, it's Gillian.
And this is Carol and Helen.

47:10.453 --> 47:11.912
-Hi.
-Hello.

47:12.288 --> 47:14.540
-I know this is weird.
-Yep.

47:14.623 --> 47:15.624
And I'm sorry.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.043
But it was Carol.

47:17.293 --> 47:19.754
-Carol wants a makeover.
-No.

47:19.837 --> 47:22.840
I did not say "makeover," okay?

47:22.923 --> 47:25.009
Look... I'm going to a party tonight.

47:25.384 --> 47:26.802
But first things first,

47:26.886 --> 47:30.056
I need to know what is your experience
with my texture of hair?

47:30.139 --> 47:32.266
Oh, yeah, I do all types of hair.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.267
See?

47:34.643 --> 47:36.562
You're the perfect stylist.

47:36.645 --> 47:37.480
Perfect.

47:37.938 --> 47:38.773
Okay.

47:39.648 --> 47:40.483
Okay.

47:40.900 --> 47:41.734
Right?

47:44.028 --> 47:45.738
Does Daniel know you're here?

47:46.906 --> 47:48.991
No. This is all me.

47:49.075 --> 47:51.619
But I remembered
that you had mentioned this salon

47:51.702 --> 47:53.704
when we had brunch that one time.

47:53.954 --> 47:57.708
Right, and then you asked me
what I wanted to be when I grew up.

47:58.459 --> 47:59.502
Jesus.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.045
Did I?

48:03.631 --> 48:04.924
I'm so sorry.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.550
Anyhoo, let's just...

48:08.010 --> 48:10.429
-get Carol started.
-No.

48:10.513 --> 48:11.514
No rush.

48:11.597 --> 48:12.973
Let's not cut angry.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.142
I'm sorry. Did I say that I'm sorry?

48:15.226 --> 48:18.437
Yeah, no, three times now.
So, I think we're good.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.023
Okay.

48:21.565 --> 48:22.566
So, Carol...

48:22.650 --> 48:23.484
Yes.

48:23.567 --> 48:24.985
Are you open to a new shape?

48:25.069 --> 48:26.404
-Well...
-She is.

48:26.612 --> 48:28.739
Well, nothing severe.

48:28.823 --> 48:32.618
You know, Finn always loved my hair
just the way that it is, so...

48:32.701 --> 48:35.955
Well, you have a beautiful face.
We should frame your face.

48:37.206 --> 48:39.667
And I think we gotta rock these curls.

48:43.045 --> 48:44.004
That's great.

48:44.755 --> 48:45.589
Nice.

48:48.467 --> 48:49.301
Yes.

48:49.969 --> 48:51.178
You're my first cut.

48:53.806 --> 48:55.516
Okay, now put your head back.

48:58.227 --> 48:59.186
What do you think?

49:01.021 --> 49:02.648
Oh, my gosh!

49:02.731 --> 49:06.402
If you looked any younger,
Matt would date you.

49:06.485 --> 49:08.070
You're a miracle worker!

49:08.154 --> 49:10.114
-No.
-Really? Was it that tired?

49:10.197 --> 49:11.198
No...

49:12.241 --> 49:13.951
Erin, thank you. I love it.

49:14.243 --> 49:15.453
I just helped you be you.

49:18.372 --> 49:19.665
Look, Erin,

49:20.332 --> 49:21.750
I really have to apologize.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.836
-Again?
-Yes, again.

49:23.919 --> 49:25.796
I should have tried harder before.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.841
Listen, maybe I could take
you and Daniel out to lunch, and...

49:28.924 --> 49:30.759
Or maybe you could do my hair?

49:31.135 --> 49:32.803
Oh, now you volunteer.

49:33.137 --> 49:33.971
Thank you.

49:34.597 --> 49:36.474
No, I'm actually moving next week.

49:36.765 --> 49:38.225
What? Why? Where?

49:38.309 --> 49:42.146
My friend has a salon in Los Angeles,
so I'm gonna try the other coast.

49:42.438 --> 49:44.690
But it was so good to see you again.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.066
And enjoy your party, Carol.

49:47.067 --> 49:48.652
Well, how can I not now?

49:49.028 --> 49:50.654
-Thank you.
-Nice to meet you, Erin.

49:51.363 --> 49:52.323
How is he?

49:52.907 --> 49:54.241
He's...

49:54.700 --> 49:56.744
Yeah, well, you know,

49:56.827 --> 49:57.703
been better.

49:58.662 --> 49:59.580
With you...

50:00.247 --> 50:01.248
he was better.

50:02.374 --> 50:03.834
Until I broke his heart.

50:06.378 --> 50:07.796
But he broke mine first.

50:08.964 --> 50:09.924
So, we're even.

50:11.842 --> 50:12.676
He did.

50:18.390 --> 50:19.934
One thing I do know...

50:20.392 --> 50:23.979
the problem is not that I meddled,
it's that I should have meddled sooner.

50:24.897 --> 50:26.398
I wouldn't tell him that.

50:27.149 --> 50:28.776
Oh, there's Paul.

50:30.653 --> 50:32.404
Look at him, he's so handsome.

50:32.488 --> 50:33.697
Okay, we're not even here.

50:33.781 --> 50:35.741
-Go enjoy your apology.
-Yes, go.

50:36.951 --> 50:38.452
-Hi.
-I don't want him to see us.

50:38.536 --> 50:41.247
We're middle-aged women in Manhattan,
practically invisible.

50:42.748 --> 50:43.624
Okay.

50:43.999 --> 50:44.875
Thank you.

50:46.418 --> 50:47.336
Thank you.

50:48.420 --> 50:51.131
You were so thoughtful with the note.

50:52.132 --> 50:53.342
Was that Andre's idea?

50:55.469 --> 50:56.554
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

50:56.637 --> 50:59.348
I'm gonna have what she's having,
without the taunting.

51:01.267 --> 51:02.351
Listen, I'm...

51:02.685 --> 51:05.854
really sorry I attacked you last night
about Dad.

51:07.982 --> 51:08.816
Yeah.

51:09.358 --> 51:10.651
-Okay?
-Yes.

51:11.026 --> 51:11.902
Sorry.

51:14.572 --> 51:17.908
It's just not my problem
if you can't let go.

51:20.703 --> 51:22.162
I usually get the fish.

51:24.873 --> 51:27.167
-So...
-What do you mean, I can't let go?

51:29.003 --> 51:30.504
I'm just saying that's the issue.

51:31.714 --> 51:33.257
Well, you're absolutely wrong.

51:33.340 --> 51:36.176
I am happily married
to someone I am in love with.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.470
I will believe anything you tell me.

51:38.762 --> 51:40.598
Please stop patronizing me.

51:40.681 --> 51:41.515
Thank you.

51:41.599 --> 51:42.683
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

51:44.518 --> 51:47.062
I'm not patronizing, I'm apologizing.

51:47.146 --> 51:50.316
So, accusing me of having a sham marriage
is what you call an apology?

51:50.399 --> 51:52.484
I'm not accusing you of anything.

51:52.568 --> 51:54.862
I'm just trying to apologize.

51:55.154 --> 51:57.197
You know, it's what you always do.

51:57.281 --> 51:59.658
You always make
some outrageous accusation,

51:59.742 --> 52:01.994
and then you act
as if I'm being hypersensitive

52:02.077 --> 52:03.495
to notice that you've said it.

52:03.871 --> 52:05.289
It's a small thing.

52:05.372 --> 52:08.792
It's a tiny observation.
It's something that was obvious to me.

52:09.209 --> 52:11.879
Mom, if I was wrong,
you wouldn't be so upset. Mom!

52:12.296 --> 52:13.631
-Oh, my...
-We should go.

52:13.714 --> 52:14.548
Don't--

52:15.716 --> 52:16.717
We should go!

52:17.885 --> 52:19.928
You should be ashamed of yourself.

52:20.804 --> 52:22.056
Carol Walker?

52:28.771 --> 52:29.855
Gillian Lieberman.

52:30.939 --> 52:33.484
I don't know why she didn't tell you
that we're in town,

52:33.567 --> 52:36.362
but I certainly wouldn't use
the word "conspiracy."

52:36.445 --> 52:38.072
My feelings, or lack of them,

52:38.155 --> 52:41.325
toward my husband and my ex-husband
are really none of your business.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.118
Well, I didn't say they were.

52:43.202 --> 52:44.536
That was meant for me.

52:45.037 --> 52:46.872
And you have no place speculating

52:46.955 --> 52:50.542
on what I may or may not
be thinking or feeling,

52:50.626 --> 52:54.421
especially when your speculations
are inaccurate and deeply hurtful.

52:54.505 --> 52:55.964
You are absolutely right.

52:56.048 --> 52:57.257
Subject closed.

52:57.341 --> 52:58.509
-Thank God.
-Yeah.

52:58.592 --> 53:01.136
I think Carol and I should get going now.

53:01.220 --> 53:04.139
Well, there's one more thing
I wanted to tell you.

53:04.223 --> 53:06.392
Just... get everything out on the table.

53:06.475 --> 53:09.561
Didn't want you to hear it
from somebody else or somebody else's son.

53:09.645 --> 53:12.773
Or if I even needed to tell you,
'cause it doesn't really involve you.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.149
Just come on, spit it out.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.819
I... might not...

53:18.612 --> 53:20.114
have children of my own.

53:20.739 --> 53:23.575
-That much I figured.
-Gay people have children all the time.

53:23.659 --> 53:25.953
-Do you want children?
-No, I do not.

53:26.036 --> 53:28.163
The point is that gay men have...

53:28.872 --> 53:30.666
sperm, and lesbians have wombs,

53:30.749 --> 53:33.836
and we don't need straight people
to tell us what we can or can't do.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.045
What?

53:36.338 --> 53:38.090
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

53:38.173 --> 53:41.343
You are too young
to make a decision like this.

53:41.427 --> 53:44.596
-A decision like what?
-Two mommies and a sperm-daddy, right?

53:44.680 --> 53:47.099
Mom, what I'm saying is...

53:47.558 --> 53:52.479
if I lent my sperm
to two women that I knew and trusted,

53:52.563 --> 53:55.649
then I would know that the child
would be loved and cared for--

53:55.733 --> 53:59.236
Are you saying you weren't loved?
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

53:59.319 --> 54:00.821
This has nothing to do with you.

54:00.904 --> 54:03.615
-This is about me.
-And the gift you're giving your friends?

54:03.699 --> 54:06.410
Yes, the gift I'm giving my friends,
which I feel good about

54:06.493 --> 54:08.454
because I love them,
and they love the baby.

54:13.709 --> 54:15.252
-Did he say baby?
-You have a baby?

54:15.335 --> 54:18.839
-There's a baby?
-What did you think we were talking about?

54:19.214 --> 54:22.760
Sperm!
I thought we were talking about sperm!

54:22.843 --> 54:24.261
A baby takes nine months.

54:24.344 --> 54:27.473
-You've kept this from me for nine months?
-Mom, the more of a scene--

54:27.556 --> 54:31.143
This has been a lovely lunch,
even though we didn't have lunch.

54:31.226 --> 54:32.144
So, don't get up.

54:32.227 --> 54:34.813
Please, just sit there and have more
<i>not </i>your children,

54:34.897 --> 54:38.525
so I can have more <i>not </i>my grandchildren,
and we can get together for the holidays

54:38.609 --> 54:40.527
and have one big, not happy, not a family,

54:40.611 --> 54:43.030
because I'm not a mother anymore,
I'm an other.

54:43.113 --> 54:45.574
-And now I am not a grandmother...
-What is...

54:45.657 --> 54:46.992
I am a grand-other!

54:47.785 --> 54:48.619
Helen, sweetie!

54:48.702 --> 54:51.663
-Your hair looks very nice, Carol.
-Well, thank you, Paul.

54:51.747 --> 54:54.291
But that was not an apology.

54:57.336 --> 54:58.170
Helen!

55:00.672 --> 55:03.217
I thought you didn't want to be
a grandmother.

55:03.300 --> 55:07.387
Well, I just don't want things
to be taken away from me.

55:07.888 --> 55:08.722
I mean...

55:09.264 --> 55:11.934
now someone else gets my grandchild,

55:12.226 --> 55:14.853
just like someone else got my husband.

55:15.938 --> 55:17.981
How did this become about Larry?

55:18.065 --> 55:20.651
Because divorce is not fair.

55:21.610 --> 55:24.321
Divorce is great for men.
They get someone...

55:24.404 --> 55:25.280
younger,

55:25.739 --> 55:27.282
thinner, better.

55:27.366 --> 55:32.412
And women get someone older and fatter,
with thinner hair!

55:34.957 --> 55:36.458
I got a text from Daniel.

55:37.918 --> 55:39.920
"Stop calling me."

55:41.839 --> 55:42.881
What should I reply?

55:42.965 --> 55:44.716
Please, don't reply.

55:45.133 --> 55:45.968
Let's just...

55:46.677 --> 55:49.596
Let's just go home
before we do any more damage.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.765
No. Carol.

55:51.849 --> 55:54.852
You and your boobs are going out,
and I don't mean me and Helen.

55:54.935 --> 55:55.853
Yeah.

55:55.936 --> 55:58.355
-Carol, you go out and have fun.
-Yeah.

55:59.147 --> 56:02.651
I wish Larry had died on me, too.

56:06.905 --> 56:09.575
You should think more about what you say

56:10.117 --> 56:11.827
and less about what you feel.

56:12.244 --> 56:13.829
I'm so sorry.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.791
What did I say?

56:19.126 --> 56:19.960
What?

56:20.043 --> 56:21.086
Really?

56:28.635 --> 56:29.469
Excuse me.

56:31.722 --> 56:33.765
I'm a guest of Matt Walker.

56:34.266 --> 56:35.934
Do you have him on the list?

56:36.602 --> 56:37.978
He's <i>All Balls.</i>

56:38.604 --> 56:39.438
The magazine.

56:40.272 --> 56:41.440
It's a magazine.

56:41.523 --> 56:43.150
Yeah. I know Matt.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.153
He's already checked in.
He doesn't have a plus one.

56:47.321 --> 56:49.656
I'm his mother. Carol Walker.

56:50.032 --> 56:51.575
I have a driver's license.

56:54.036 --> 56:54.870
There.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.790
And a picture of Matt in the tub
when he was three.

56:59.750 --> 57:01.001
Does he have a woody?

57:02.252 --> 57:05.172
Oh, no, that's a toy boat.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.007
Oh, my God.

57:10.844 --> 57:12.262
It's for Instagram.

57:14.723 --> 57:15.682
She's good.

57:50.759 --> 57:53.011
Excuse me.

57:53.095 --> 57:54.054
Excuse me.

58:04.773 --> 58:06.149
I ruined your dress.

58:06.650 --> 58:08.694
-I'm so sorry.
-I never liked this dress.

58:08.777 --> 58:09.861
Oh, it's all my fault.

58:10.362 --> 58:11.488
I'm running from my son.

58:12.739 --> 58:13.615
I'm Julia.

58:15.367 --> 58:17.160
Carol... Walker.

58:17.536 --> 58:19.329
Why are you running from your son?

58:19.955 --> 58:21.707
Well, he told me I couldn't come.

58:22.082 --> 58:23.083
That's not nice.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.710
Maybe it was.

58:24.793 --> 58:27.295
Maybe he knew everyone here
would be 30 years younger,

58:27.379 --> 58:30.132
and I would feel like the last dinosaur.

58:31.508 --> 58:34.803
-Well, thank you, Damon. Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.224
Damon, Damon, Damon.

58:39.474 --> 58:40.308
Hey.

58:40.392 --> 58:42.853
Hey, would a grandma wear these?

58:42.936 --> 58:45.480
No, especially not to bed.

58:45.564 --> 58:49.026
We are not going to bed,
we are going clubbing.

58:49.693 --> 58:52.320
I didn't go clubbing
when I was supposed to go clubbing.

58:52.404 --> 58:53.989
Would we even get into a club?

58:54.072 --> 58:57.200
Well, I didn't think I'd get
into these jeans, and look at me now.

58:57.284 --> 58:58.243
Can you breathe?

58:58.326 --> 58:59.411
Sporadically.

58:59.494 --> 59:02.039
Come on. Let's go downstairs.

59:02.122 --> 59:04.624
This hotel is supposed to be
a huge party scene.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.168
Just call for a bellboy.

59:06.376 --> 59:09.463
One's more gorgeous than the next,
and they come to you.

59:09.546 --> 59:12.090
I know. You've called for ice twice.

59:12.174 --> 59:13.925
Just fuck one of them already.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.552
What? I'm thirsty.

59:15.761 --> 59:18.388
Come on, we are in New York City.

59:18.472 --> 59:20.182
Let's go!

59:20.932 --> 59:22.601
Okay. Let me take a shower.

59:23.477 --> 59:24.394
Yes.

59:24.478 --> 59:25.687
I think this might be him.

59:26.063 --> 59:27.981
Is he the most handsome guy in the room?

59:28.982 --> 59:30.025
He's got swagger.

59:33.820 --> 59:34.654
That's him.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.282
I can't talk to him right now.

59:37.741 --> 59:38.575
Matt...

59:39.326 --> 59:41.203
has never seen me drunk.

59:42.662 --> 59:46.708
So, tell me more about this non-profit
that you're working with.

59:46.792 --> 59:48.335
It's called micro lending.

59:48.418 --> 59:51.671
We provide small loans
for the world's poorest of the poor,

59:51.755 --> 59:52.798
mostly women,

59:52.881 --> 59:55.383
so they can work their own way
out of poverty.

59:55.467 --> 59:58.845
I want you to give my son a child.

1:00:02.182 --> 1:00:03.016
Matt...

1:00:03.433 --> 1:00:06.144
He may seem vain, and superficial, and...

1:00:06.228 --> 1:00:10.649
so afraid of any real emotion
that it makes you cry.

1:00:11.441 --> 1:00:14.236
But he's basically good.

1:00:14.820 --> 1:00:19.449
He has it in him to be a really good man.

1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:22.077
I need you to show him

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:24.621
how to be that man.

1:00:27.415 --> 1:00:29.209
I think we should get you home.

1:00:30.293 --> 1:00:31.253
Let's dance.

1:00:31.503 --> 1:00:34.172
I used to love to dance.

1:00:40.679 --> 1:00:43.181
Matt's dad used to take me dancing.

1:00:44.182 --> 1:00:45.392
He's dead now.

1:00:45.976 --> 1:00:47.310
That's why he stopped.

1:00:51.982 --> 1:00:52.816
Mom!

1:00:54.025 --> 1:00:54.943
What are you...

1:00:55.735 --> 1:00:57.946
What is all this?
What happened to your hair?

1:00:58.029 --> 1:01:00.657
And Mom, you did not have those
this morning.

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:02.826
Matt...

1:01:03.743 --> 1:01:05.620
I'm in love with Julia!

1:01:07.330 --> 1:01:10.167
I love her. I think you might, too.

1:01:13.044 --> 1:01:14.963
Okay, let go of her hand.

1:01:15.046 --> 1:01:16.298
She is my mother.

1:01:16.381 --> 1:01:19.092
Dancing does not make you a lesbian.

1:01:19.176 --> 1:01:22.053
-Your dad liked lesbians, by the way.
-Mom.

1:01:22.137 --> 1:01:24.306
I found his videos after he died.

1:01:24.723 --> 1:01:27.434
Please, stop talking and dancing.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:30.687
You know what?
Let's just get you into a cab.

1:01:30.770 --> 1:01:32.314
You get into a cab!

1:01:33.148 --> 1:01:34.399
I'm having dessert.

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:38.028
I may stay out all night.

1:01:38.445 --> 1:01:40.280
I may drink from a shoe.

1:01:41.323 --> 1:01:43.658
I was a girl before I was your mother.

1:01:45.702 --> 1:01:47.704
All right, does this outfit work?

1:01:47.787 --> 1:01:49.956
I mean, outside Poughkeepsie.

1:01:57.088 --> 1:01:57.923
Shoot.

1:01:58.757 --> 1:01:59.925
-Hey.
<i>-Gillian.</i>

1:02:00.884 --> 1:02:02.427
<i>I need my friends.</i>

1:02:03.511 --> 1:02:04.888
He barely recognized me.

1:02:04.971 --> 1:02:06.389
Because of your new look?

1:02:06.473 --> 1:02:08.934
No! Because I was having fun!

1:02:09.017 --> 1:02:11.603
-That's what we were supposed to do.
-You passed out.

1:02:11.686 --> 1:02:14.105
By the way, you have incredible
new beauty products.

1:02:14.189 --> 1:02:15.982
Yeah. It's all anti-aging.

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:18.193
Why is everyone anti-aging?

1:02:18.276 --> 1:02:20.153
You know what's anti-aging?

1:02:20.237 --> 1:02:21.071
Death.

1:02:21.404 --> 1:02:22.864
Let's be happy we're aging.

1:02:22.948 --> 1:02:23.782
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:02:24.115 --> 1:02:25.033
By the way,

1:02:25.116 --> 1:02:29.246
do you know how long it's been
since I have had--

1:02:29.329 --> 1:02:30.163
Sex?

1:02:30.914 --> 1:02:32.499
I was gonna say pizza.

1:02:39.005 --> 1:02:40.715
I'm not going home tonight.

1:02:41.132 --> 1:02:42.467
I mean, Matt's home.

1:02:43.093 --> 1:02:44.135
I'm on vacation.

1:02:44.219 --> 1:02:46.972
-So, we're done with the mission?
-We have a new mission.

1:02:48.098 --> 1:02:49.599
Dance till dawn.

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:53.478
But... did we fail the first mission?

1:02:53.895 --> 1:02:55.313
Fuck the first mission!

1:02:55.397 --> 1:02:56.606
What about the boys?

1:02:56.815 --> 1:02:58.650
Fuck the boys!

1:02:58.817 --> 1:02:59.901
Wow!

1:02:59.985 --> 1:03:01.820
Man, I love the new Carol!

1:03:01.903 --> 1:03:02.988
Yeah!

1:03:03.071 --> 1:03:04.864
Yes!

1:03:40.442 --> 1:03:41.276
One more.

1:03:50.577 --> 1:03:51.828
Get it, girl! Get it!

1:03:53.621 --> 1:03:55.206
One, two, three.

1:04:02.672 --> 1:04:03.506
Yes!

1:04:24.110 --> 1:04:24.986
Come on.

1:04:39.292 --> 1:04:40.502
Yeah.

1:04:48.510 --> 1:04:49.344
It's you.

1:04:53.807 --> 1:04:55.308
Your mother left this in the cab.

1:04:57.394 --> 1:04:58.228
Thank you.

1:04:59.187 --> 1:05:00.438
Do you know where she is?

1:05:00.522 --> 1:05:01.398
Sleeping.

1:05:01.856 --> 1:05:02.690
It's early.

1:05:03.066 --> 1:05:04.401
-Is she?
-Isn't she?

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:06.820
This isn't where I dropped her.

1:05:07.445 --> 1:05:09.280
I got your address from her phone.

1:05:15.995 --> 1:05:16.830
Ma?

1:05:18.832 --> 1:05:22.377
-Okay, where did you drop her?
-At a pizza place in the Village.

1:05:22.460 --> 1:05:25.296
-She was meeting friends.
-She doesn't eat pizza.

1:05:25.839 --> 1:05:28.049
And she doesn't have any friends
in the Village.

1:05:28.133 --> 1:05:30.927
The hair and the dress.
Like she wanted people to look at her,

1:05:31.010 --> 1:05:32.178
and that's not my mother.

1:05:32.262 --> 1:05:35.640
-Okay? She doesn't even like dancing.
-She loves to dance.

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:40.437
Right.

1:05:41.855 --> 1:05:45.108
My name and number are on a napkin
in the phone case.

1:05:46.734 --> 1:05:48.153
I'd like to know she's okay.

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:53.783
Wait.

1:05:53.867 --> 1:05:55.118
Hey. Hi, Mrs. Dean.

1:05:55.577 --> 1:05:56.411
Julia.

1:05:57.245 --> 1:05:59.080
Look, thanks. That was...

1:06:00.707 --> 1:06:01.624
That was nice.

1:06:02.709 --> 1:06:04.627
Great photo on Instagram, by the way.

1:06:05.044 --> 1:06:05.879
What?

1:06:12.218 --> 1:06:13.803
Is that someone knocking?

1:06:14.304 --> 1:06:16.097
Or is it just my head pounding?

1:06:16.347 --> 1:06:17.974
You go out, Gill. Go.

1:06:18.183 --> 1:06:19.100
Why me?

1:06:20.143 --> 1:06:20.977
Okay.

1:06:26.441 --> 1:06:27.400
What is it?

1:06:27.484 --> 1:06:28.860
-Hey, Mom.
-Daniel.

1:06:28.943 --> 1:06:31.029
-Excuse me.
-What? Matt?

1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:33.198
-They're here.
-Yeah.

1:06:34.199 --> 1:06:35.033
Mom.

1:06:35.116 --> 1:06:35.950
Mom!

1:06:36.701 --> 1:06:40.246
Is this why you couldn't make a call?
Your new friend dropped this off.

1:06:40.830 --> 1:06:43.082
-Why?
-We were worried sick.

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:44.834
Did I invite any of you in?

1:06:44.918 --> 1:06:46.669
Did we invite any of you to New York?

1:06:46.753 --> 1:06:49.088
Okay, could everyone
just please stop shouting?

1:06:49.172 --> 1:06:50.340
I have a hangover.

1:06:51.132 --> 1:06:54.636
Yeah, Mom, that's what happens
when you get drunk at my work party.

1:06:54.928 --> 1:06:57.263
And now there is a naked picture of me
on Instagram.

1:06:57.347 --> 1:07:00.308
-I had nothing to do with a naked picture.
-In the tub.

1:07:01.518 --> 1:07:03.561
Oh, yeah. Well, I just showed one person.

1:07:03.645 --> 1:07:05.146
We're allowed to be in New York.

1:07:05.230 --> 1:07:07.398
I had no idea where you were last night.

1:07:07.482 --> 1:07:10.109
I had no idea I had a grandchild,
so we're even.

1:07:11.903 --> 1:07:12.820
I told her.

1:07:13.154 --> 1:07:14.822
See, Paul talks to his mom.

1:07:14.906 --> 1:07:16.866
Why did you break up with Erin?

1:07:16.950 --> 1:07:19.077
Ma, yesterday you told me
you were checking out.

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:20.495
Why are you still here again?

1:07:20.578 --> 1:07:23.665
-Wait, hang on. You've been in a hotel?
-Why? Is that a crime?

1:07:23.748 --> 1:07:27.418
-Why didn't you stay in a hotel?
-Well, Helen and Gillian wouldn't let me.

1:07:27.502 --> 1:07:29.003
Why? What's wrong with a hotel?

1:07:29.087 --> 1:07:31.172
Well, I'll tell you what's wrong
with this one.

1:07:31.256 --> 1:07:32.590
The security stinks.

1:07:33.049 --> 1:07:35.176
Would you put on a robe at least?

1:07:35.260 --> 1:07:39.430
-Oh, what do you care? You're gay. Here.
-You know what? I'm gay, not blind.

1:07:39.514 --> 1:07:41.641
Okay, Matt, I'll see you at home.

1:07:41.724 --> 1:07:43.059
Your home is in Poughkeepsie!

1:07:43.142 --> 1:07:44.978
-That's not nice.
-I'm sorry.

1:07:48.815 --> 1:07:49.732
Bye, Ma.

1:07:52.110 --> 1:07:55.363
-I've wanted to see those since I was ten.
-Those are some nice titties.

1:07:55.446 --> 1:07:57.782
Talk about something other
than my mother's breasts.

1:07:57.865 --> 1:08:00.827
-She's a lovely lady.
-How about where we're going to lunch?

1:08:00.910 --> 1:08:03.246
How about we talk about Woody Walker?

1:08:03.329 --> 1:08:04.163
Oh, my God.

1:08:04.247 --> 1:08:06.958
-You should be proud.
-It was a toy boat!

1:08:07.041 --> 1:08:09.836
-A penis-shaped toy boat?
-Seventy thousand likes?

1:08:09.919 --> 1:08:10.878
Let me see that.

1:08:14.132 --> 1:08:15.383
I am so mad at her.

1:08:15.466 --> 1:08:17.385
-Just breathe. Stop.
-So...

1:08:21.764 --> 1:08:22.640
I forgive you.

1:08:24.267 --> 1:08:25.560
Okay, good.

1:08:27.228 --> 1:08:29.272
Did you tell Larry he has a grandchild?

1:08:29.814 --> 1:08:31.107
I'm gonna go to the store.

1:08:31.816 --> 1:08:32.650
Yes.

1:08:32.734 --> 1:08:34.777
And he respected my decision.

1:08:35.194 --> 1:08:36.195
I'm sure he did.

1:08:38.448 --> 1:08:40.283
It does not matter anyway, Mom.

1:08:40.950 --> 1:08:42.660
Dad does not have a grandchild.

1:08:42.744 --> 1:08:44.704
-You do not have a grandchild.
-I know.

1:08:44.787 --> 1:08:46.164
I do not have a daughter.

1:08:46.247 --> 1:08:47.790
This was sperm only.

1:08:47.874 --> 1:08:50.168
Oh, Paul, it's a girl?

1:08:54.172 --> 1:08:55.173
I'm going home.

1:08:56.257 --> 1:08:57.592
I shouldn't have come.

1:08:58.092 --> 1:09:01.304
Well, what did you think
was gonna happen, Mom?

1:09:03.014 --> 1:09:04.974
I thought you wouldn't let me in.

1:09:05.433 --> 1:09:06.559
That was an option?

1:09:08.061 --> 1:09:09.103
You're popular.

1:09:10.146 --> 1:09:11.147
You're successful.

1:09:12.065 --> 1:09:14.108
Mom, you make it sound so depressing.

1:09:14.192 --> 1:09:17.528
No, this is what's supposed to happen
to children.

1:09:18.613 --> 1:09:20.406
You're fully independent.

1:09:20.823 --> 1:09:23.618
Mom, why does it feel
like we're breaking up?

1:09:23.701 --> 1:09:26.537
Matthew, I need to tell you something.

1:09:27.038 --> 1:09:30.792
Your dad didn't want me at your games.
That's why I didn't go.

1:09:32.210 --> 1:09:33.878
I thought he drove you too hard.

1:09:33.961 --> 1:09:36.964
And we would argue about it,
and finally, he said,

1:09:37.048 --> 1:09:39.300
"Well, stop coming if it bothers you."

1:09:40.134 --> 1:09:41.469
So, I did.

1:09:43.221 --> 1:09:45.640
And then all the trophies
started rolling in,

1:09:45.723 --> 1:09:48.518
and I thought he was right
and I was wrong.

1:09:50.061 --> 1:09:52.313
And now it turns out that I was right.

1:09:54.357 --> 1:09:57.193
And what's so ironic is that...

1:09:58.695 --> 1:10:01.614
you did need me then,
and you don't need me now.

1:10:02.532 --> 1:10:04.075
Mom, I'm fine.

1:10:05.410 --> 1:10:08.121
-Right? I turned out fine, right?
-Matthew...

1:10:08.830 --> 1:10:10.790
You know who you are without me.

1:10:13.459 --> 1:10:16.003
I need to figure out who I am without you.

1:10:29.517 --> 1:10:32.770
So, apparently, the one
who didn't carry the baby

1:10:32.854 --> 1:10:35.523
is saying that <i>her </i>mother
is the daddy granny,

1:10:35.606 --> 1:10:38.151
so, I'm not anything.

1:10:38.526 --> 1:10:41.362
And they even had the gall to tell Paul

1:10:41.446 --> 1:10:43.948
they didn't want me to even see Ella.

1:10:44.031 --> 1:10:46.325
-Well, what changed their mind?
-Nothing.

1:10:46.409 --> 1:10:48.244
And you know what is most unfair?

1:10:48.327 --> 1:10:49.579
I always wanted a girl.

1:10:49.662 --> 1:10:50.913
Larry was one and done,

1:10:50.997 --> 1:10:53.166
but I would've had three
if he hadn't been--

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:55.835
Wait, why are we here
if you can't see the kid?

1:10:55.918 --> 1:10:58.671
I could be hijacking Erin's moving van
right now.

1:10:58.755 --> 1:11:02.049
-It's not a perfect plan, but it's a plan.
-I thought we were going home.

1:11:02.133 --> 1:11:04.594
Yeah, we are.
We're just stopping in Cobble Hill first.

1:11:04.677 --> 1:11:08.222
I convinced Paul to give me the address.
I don't want to show up empty-handed.

1:11:08.306 --> 1:11:11.809
Well, we weren't wanted by our sons.
That didn't stop us.

1:11:11.893 --> 1:11:15.062
Yeah, I am so tired of being stopped.

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:19.400
Larry said if it meant so much to me
to have a girl, I should've had twins.

1:11:19.484 --> 1:11:21.486
Larry, Larry, Larry! Enough with Larry!

1:11:21.569 --> 1:11:24.739
We never want to hear his name again.
We never even liked him.

1:11:26.532 --> 1:11:29.869
Look, you've been divorced from that idiot
for 11 years.

1:11:29.952 --> 1:11:32.371
You still talk about him
in the present tense.

1:11:32.747 --> 1:11:34.957
You're wasting a good marriage

1:11:35.041 --> 1:11:37.251
because you refuse to let go of a bad one.

1:11:37.335 --> 1:11:39.670
-What about baby yoga mats?
-Are you jealous?

1:11:39.754 --> 1:11:41.547
-Is that what this is about?
-What?

1:11:41.631 --> 1:11:44.175
You're jealous that I'm the one
that has a grandchild?

1:11:44.258 --> 1:11:45.218
-Oh, Helen.
-What?

1:11:45.301 --> 1:11:48.012
We are thrilled
that you get to meet Ella today.

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:50.973
I think what Gillian is trying to say

1:11:51.057 --> 1:11:53.309
is that you have something special
in Frank.

1:11:53.684 --> 1:11:57.271
The way he looks at you,
the way he talks about you.

1:11:57.355 --> 1:12:01.526
You have no idea how fortunate you are
to have Frank instead of Larry.

1:12:01.609 --> 1:12:02.777
We're not jealous of you.

1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:05.905
Paul went in a room and jerked off.
If that makes you a grandmother,

1:12:05.988 --> 1:12:08.366
-then we're all grandmothers.
-Let's stop, all right?

1:12:08.449 --> 1:12:12.161
We've already pissed off our sons.
We are all that we have left.

1:12:12.787 --> 1:12:14.205
Jealous?

1:12:14.288 --> 1:12:16.290
Oh, my God.

1:12:16.707 --> 1:12:18.543
What is wrong with you, Helen?

1:12:22.171 --> 1:12:23.422
Okay.

1:12:23.881 --> 1:12:25.424
I'm gonna tell you what's wrong.

1:12:25.508 --> 1:12:27.385
And it has been brewing for 11 years.

1:12:27.718 --> 1:12:29.846
You know why I divorced Larry, right?

1:12:29.929 --> 1:12:31.055
Yeah. He cheated on you.

1:12:31.138 --> 1:12:34.016
Yeah. It was that year our husbands
went on that fishing trip

1:12:34.100 --> 1:12:35.309
-to the Berkshires.
-Right.

1:12:35.393 --> 1:12:36.936
Okay, Helen. You win.

1:12:37.019 --> 1:12:40.064
And Larry had a fuck buddy up there,
and I found out about it,

1:12:40.147 --> 1:12:43.109
and I had the courage
and the self-dignity to leave.

1:12:43.192 --> 1:12:45.319
He was paying her rent
from Paul's college fund.

1:12:45.653 --> 1:12:47.572
She was an anorexic blonde vegan,

1:12:47.655 --> 1:12:50.950
and she had a friend
for Gillian's husband.

1:12:51.993 --> 1:12:54.829
Joel cheated on Gillian
just like Larry cheated on me,

1:12:54.912 --> 1:12:56.330
but she forgave him.

1:12:56.414 --> 1:13:00.918
I don't expect you to understand
why I forgave Joel,

1:13:01.002 --> 1:13:03.963
because the only person
you've ever truly loved is yourself.

1:13:04.338 --> 1:13:06.757
Not Larry, and not Frank,

1:13:06.841 --> 1:13:10.887
and not Carol, or me,
or your new "spermdaughter,"

1:13:10.970 --> 1:13:12.805
not even your own son!

1:13:13.723 --> 1:13:17.018
The only person you ever loved was you.

1:13:17.727 --> 1:13:18.561
Okay.

1:13:18.978 --> 1:13:21.397
Well, if you are so much better at loving,

1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:25.276
then why is your son the one
who's broke, depressed, and jobless?

1:13:26.527 --> 1:13:27.612
I'll tell you why.

1:13:28.029 --> 1:13:30.781
Because you sabotaged
his chance at happiness.

1:13:31.324 --> 1:13:34.702
-That is bullshit, and you know it.
-Is it? He had a ring.

1:13:34.869 --> 1:13:35.870
But you...

1:13:35.953 --> 1:13:38.998
You planted so many doubts.

1:13:39.081 --> 1:13:41.250
Not just about Erin, but about himself,

1:13:41.334 --> 1:13:43.628
so that when he finally had the balls
to propose,

1:13:43.711 --> 1:13:45.755
he caught Erin schtupping her trainer.

1:13:45.838 --> 1:13:47.423
I think Daniel would've mentioned--

1:13:47.506 --> 1:13:49.675
He didn't want to give you
the satisfaction.

1:13:49.759 --> 1:13:51.761
You hated Erin until ten minutes ago.

1:13:51.844 --> 1:13:53.387
Paul told me.

1:13:53.930 --> 1:13:55.056
Did you know about this?

1:14:00.311 --> 1:14:03.064
I think Matt mentioned something
once about a ring.

1:14:03.147 --> 1:14:05.816
-Helen. About that fishing trip.
-No.

1:14:06.025 --> 1:14:09.528
-Carol, let's just go now.
-And Paul jerked off to create a person.

1:14:09.612 --> 1:14:11.614
Helen, in the Berkshires...

1:14:14.408 --> 1:14:17.161
did the vegan have someone for Finn?

1:14:19.330 --> 1:14:21.707
I'm sorry. She was full of friends.

1:14:30.174 --> 1:14:31.384
All this time...

1:14:32.468 --> 1:14:35.012
and neither of you said anything to me.

1:14:38.724 --> 1:14:40.768
And I thought we were friends.

1:14:43.521 --> 1:14:44.397
Oh, fuck.

1:14:44.814 --> 1:14:46.190
You're taking a train home.

1:14:48.859 --> 1:14:51.821
-Please, don't leave. You guys, I'm sorry!
-Let me drive you home.

1:14:51.904 --> 1:14:54.031
Carol, I'm sorry! Gillian, wait!

1:14:54.115 --> 1:14:55.658
-Don't leave!
-Stop.

1:14:56.909 --> 1:14:59.537
That was bad!

1:15:59.430 --> 1:16:01.724
Open the door or I'm gonna start singing!

1:16:02.266 --> 1:16:05.561
Do you need directions home?
I can show you how to Waze.

1:16:06.645 --> 1:16:08.522
I don't want the government tracking me.

1:16:08.939 --> 1:16:11.901
-Would it kill you to answer your phone?
-I've been working.

1:16:12.109 --> 1:16:13.778
-On what?
-My novel.

1:16:14.195 --> 1:16:15.654
I finally got inspired.

1:16:15.738 --> 1:16:18.699
It's about an overbearing mother.
It's called <i>Baking and Entering.</i>

1:16:19.366 --> 1:16:21.202
Daniel, this is important.

1:16:21.535 --> 1:16:23.204
Do you still have the ring?

1:16:26.207 --> 1:16:27.041
What ring?

1:16:27.750 --> 1:16:30.169
The one you were planning on giving Erin.

1:16:31.087 --> 1:16:33.214
Honey, why didn't you say anything?

1:16:33.714 --> 1:16:37.259
Well, you never liked her anyway, Ma.
So, what's the difference?

1:16:37.343 --> 1:16:41.222
Well, what do I know?
I'm just some weird internet stalker.

1:16:42.223 --> 1:16:43.140
And I was wrong.

1:16:43.224 --> 1:16:46.102
I always wondered what it'd be like
to hear you say those words.

1:16:46.185 --> 1:16:48.437
And as it turns out,
you were actually right, so...

1:16:48.521 --> 1:16:49.355
No.

1:16:50.064 --> 1:16:53.067
She's a lovely woman,
and you're a lovely man.

1:16:54.318 --> 1:16:56.278
So, if you have that ring,

1:16:57.279 --> 1:16:59.365
and if she is the love of your life,

1:16:59.949 --> 1:17:02.910
then do something before it is too late.

1:17:02.993 --> 1:17:07.748
Because for all you know, she might be
packing her bags and leaving town...

1:17:08.124 --> 1:17:09.041
or something.

1:17:12.086 --> 1:17:12.920
I love you.

1:17:13.254 --> 1:17:14.421
You're a grown man.

1:17:15.548 --> 1:17:18.759
I  just hope you do what is best
for your life and your future.

1:17:18.843 --> 1:17:21.178
Did you see her somewhere or something?

1:17:21.428 --> 1:17:22.346
Ma, wait.

1:17:23.806 --> 1:17:26.142
Mom! Did you break into her place, too?

1:18:17.193 --> 1:18:18.027
Hello!

1:18:24.950 --> 1:18:27.077
Is there a reason you're following me?

1:18:28.746 --> 1:18:30.664
Paul said you wouldn't listen to us.

1:18:32.166 --> 1:18:34.501
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

1:18:36.253 --> 1:18:37.588
What is it that you want?

1:18:39.757 --> 1:18:40.591
I...

1:18:41.258 --> 1:18:42.092
I don't want...

1:18:42.968 --> 1:18:46.472
anything. I'm not asking for anything.
I'm just...

1:18:47.097 --> 1:18:48.515
saying what I am.

1:18:50.226 --> 1:18:51.393
A grandmother.

1:18:52.478 --> 1:18:54.063
She has grandmothers.

1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:01.779
I brought a few...

1:19:04.615 --> 1:19:05.741
hundred gifts.

1:19:08.452 --> 1:19:10.704
Look, we talked about this
before the birth.

1:19:10.788 --> 1:19:11.956
We adore Paul.

1:19:12.373 --> 1:19:15.209
We do, and we want Ella to know Paul.

1:19:15.459 --> 1:19:18.837
We hope she gets some of his great
qualities. That's why we chose him.

1:19:19.964 --> 1:19:21.215
But he's not the dad.

1:19:21.298 --> 1:19:22.841
He's a sperm donor, okay?

1:19:22.925 --> 1:19:24.927
We all agreed. We signed papers.

1:19:29.056 --> 1:19:29.890
But...

1:19:30.891 --> 1:19:32.226
now that I have her...

1:19:33.686 --> 1:19:35.896
and now that I know what it feels like...

1:19:37.106 --> 1:19:39.400
when she has a baby, if...

1:19:40.401 --> 1:19:41.610
she has a baby...

1:19:42.653 --> 1:19:44.446
if I couldn't see that baby...

1:19:46.991 --> 1:19:49.994
I'd probably chase that baby
all over the city, too.

1:19:54.039 --> 1:19:55.207
It's okay, honey.

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.385
She looks just like Paul did.

1:20:10.681 --> 1:20:12.308
Would you like to hold her?

1:20:14.685 --> 1:20:15.519
Come on.

1:20:16.770 --> 1:20:17.896
-Say hi.
-Hi.

1:20:19.732 --> 1:20:21.317
Hi!

1:20:22.401 --> 1:20:23.360
Hi!

1:20:25.112 --> 1:20:27.281
-Hi.
-That's a good girl.

1:20:27.990 --> 1:20:32.077
I want to be a good grandmother.
A good one. Not a bad one.

1:20:36.623 --> 1:20:39.543
Honey, five weeks is not late.

1:20:39.626 --> 1:20:41.712
Five weeks is abandonment.

1:20:42.212 --> 1:20:44.715
It sounds like she waited
a long time for you.

1:20:45.090 --> 1:20:46.467
All right, Ma. You know what?

1:20:46.550 --> 1:20:49.803
You and Dad have, like,
your perfect story, so, you wouldn't...

1:20:49.887 --> 1:20:51.764
No. There is no perfect story.

1:20:53.057 --> 1:20:54.141
In fact...

1:20:56.393 --> 1:21:00.064
years ago, your father had an infidelity.

1:21:09.448 --> 1:21:11.116
Before I was born or after?

1:21:13.494 --> 1:21:15.371
You were 16.

1:21:19.083 --> 1:21:20.417
How'd you forgive him?

1:21:23.462 --> 1:21:24.380
It wasn't easy.

1:21:25.464 --> 1:21:27.383
I went crazy for a little while.

1:21:27.466 --> 1:21:30.886
I went on this...
fakakta five-week egg diet.

1:21:30.969 --> 1:21:31.887
You remember?

1:21:31.970 --> 1:21:33.639
Yes, I do. You were, like...

1:21:33.722 --> 1:21:35.557
-You wanted chickens or something.
-Yeah.

1:21:35.641 --> 1:21:36.558
A chicken coop?

1:21:38.394 --> 1:21:39.311
But...

1:21:39.395 --> 1:21:40.604
I realized...

1:21:41.522 --> 1:21:43.190
I still wanted your dad.

1:21:45.234 --> 1:21:48.112
And I decided to do the harder thing
and stay.

1:21:51.573 --> 1:21:53.117
But I think what really...

1:21:54.076 --> 1:21:56.537
made it possible for me to forgive him...

1:21:57.454 --> 1:21:58.288
was...

1:21:58.705 --> 1:22:01.083
he never fully forgave himself.

1:22:04.128 --> 1:22:05.629
Mom, I really admire you.

1:22:07.047 --> 1:22:09.633
And I get why you're sharing
this story with me.

1:22:12.553 --> 1:22:14.471
I just don't think I'm built like that.

1:22:18.892 --> 1:22:20.102
This is your life.

1:22:20.769 --> 1:22:24.648
This big, bruised, bloody,
beautiful thing.

1:22:24.731 --> 1:22:27.693
This is your life.
I'm not going to tell you what to do.

1:22:27.776 --> 1:22:28.694
Since when?

1:22:29.528 --> 1:22:30.737
Since today.

1:22:31.405 --> 1:22:32.781
-Okay.
-Daniel, hey.

1:22:33.574 --> 1:22:37.286
You have been under the water
for a long time.

1:22:39.329 --> 1:22:40.581
But when you come up,

1:22:41.874 --> 1:22:44.126
you need to decide what life you want.

1:22:48.714 --> 1:22:49.631
You got this.

1:22:51.008 --> 1:22:51.842
I love you.

1:22:54.344 --> 1:22:55.179
Ma.

1:22:56.638 --> 1:22:58.599
I think I'm locked out of my apartment.

1:22:58.682 --> 1:23:00.309
Use the window. That's what I do.

1:23:01.018 --> 1:23:01.977
I'm out!

1:24:21.848 --> 1:24:22.766
Hi.

1:24:23.141 --> 1:24:24.601
You're back.

1:24:28.438 --> 1:24:30.357
What's the matter, sweetheart?

1:24:30.941 --> 1:24:32.150
You and Paul have a fight?

1:24:33.277 --> 1:24:34.111
Several.

1:24:34.820 --> 1:24:35.779
And Gillian.

1:24:36.071 --> 1:24:36.905
And Carol.

1:24:37.781 --> 1:24:39.866
We didn't even drive back together.

1:24:40.534 --> 1:24:41.577
Everyone is...

1:24:42.619 --> 1:24:43.954
sick of me,

1:24:44.037 --> 1:24:45.706
and... so am I.

1:24:48.709 --> 1:24:50.794
Frank, why did you marry me?

1:24:51.003 --> 1:24:51.837
What?

1:24:52.212 --> 1:24:55.674
Well, I think what everybody wonders
is why you married me.

1:24:56.174 --> 1:24:57.509
No, really.

1:24:58.427 --> 1:24:59.386
Why?

1:25:00.846 --> 1:25:01.930
You're kind.

1:25:02.806 --> 1:25:05.309
And you're smart. You're funny as hell.

1:25:05.642 --> 1:25:07.519
You have a lot of love to give.

1:25:07.603 --> 1:25:10.147
-I do, right?
-Yes.

1:25:10.522 --> 1:25:11.940
And you're opinionated,

1:25:12.858 --> 1:25:13.942
and passionate.

1:25:15.152 --> 1:25:18.155
Sometimes you have sharp edges,
and I like that.

1:25:19.156 --> 1:25:20.657
You tell it like it is.

1:25:22.034 --> 1:25:22.868
My...

1:25:23.577 --> 1:25:24.453
looks?

1:25:24.828 --> 1:25:27.664
Oh, you think I married you
for your personality?

1:25:29.916 --> 1:25:31.418
You come in a very...

1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:33.587
beautiful package.

1:25:35.047 --> 1:25:37.716
But that's not all there is
to Helen Halston.

1:25:39.843 --> 1:25:42.554
I am so lucky.

1:25:44.139 --> 1:25:45.015
I'm so...

1:25:50.103 --> 1:25:52.064
-Oh, really?
-Yes. We're doing it.

1:26:02.824 --> 1:26:03.825
Thanks for coming.

1:26:04.409 --> 1:26:05.952
Your texts wore me down.

1:26:07.954 --> 1:26:09.164
Did you bring a pen?

1:26:19.466 --> 1:26:22.511
-Hey, Mrs. Walker. More flowers.
-It must be some mistake.

1:26:23.053 --> 1:26:24.680
I didn't order any flowers.

1:26:25.472 --> 1:26:26.807
There's a note with them.

1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:31.561
<i>Her favorite flower is... an Iris.</i>

1:26:31.812 --> 1:26:33.271
Well, thank you, Shawn.

1:26:33.355 --> 1:26:35.190
And I know that because she told me

1:26:35.273 --> 1:26:37.526
when she asked me for ten things
I know about her.

1:26:38.026 --> 1:26:41.154
-Then you can't use it.
-What? Yes, I can. It's a freebie.

1:26:41.238 --> 1:26:43.865
If you can't think of ten things
you know about your mother

1:26:43.949 --> 1:26:46.535
without one of them being something
she flat-out told you,

1:26:46.618 --> 1:26:47.786
then you're a shitty son.

1:26:47.869 --> 1:26:49.371
I am not a shitty son.

1:26:49.663 --> 1:26:52.165
Then think about why you love her
and write it down.

1:26:54.835 --> 1:26:58.046
<i>I know she loved my father,</i>
<i>and he wasn't that lovable.</i>

1:26:58.463 --> 1:27:00.132
<i>He was always working.</i>

1:27:00.674 --> 1:27:03.218
<i>Even when we played, it was work.</i>

1:27:04.678 --> 1:27:06.888
My mom was the one who taught me
how to have fun.

1:27:08.181 --> 1:27:09.975
When I was a kid, she used to...

1:27:10.308 --> 1:27:12.686
read me these bedtime stories, and...

1:27:13.270 --> 1:27:15.522
she'd pretend there was one more page.

1:27:18.817 --> 1:27:21.069
And we'd make up a new ending.

1:27:26.074 --> 1:27:27.868
-Write that down.
-Oh, yeah.

1:27:29.327 --> 1:27:31.455
<i>She did a lot of art when I was a kid.</i>

1:27:31.830 --> 1:27:33.206
<i>Pen and ink note cards,</i>

1:27:33.790 --> 1:27:35.625
oil paintings from photographs.

1:27:36.710 --> 1:27:38.378
This one time, she did this...

1:27:40.338 --> 1:27:41.715
great mural on my wall.

1:27:45.844 --> 1:27:46.678
<i>One:</i>

1:27:47.053 --> 1:27:48.555
<i>You loved my father.</i>

1:27:51.099 --> 1:27:51.933
<i>Two:</i>

1:27:52.726 --> 1:27:54.519
<i>You taught me how to have fun.</i>

1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:57.314
<i>Three:</i>

1:27:57.939 --> 1:27:59.608
<i>You could have been an artist.</i>

1:28:00.233 --> 1:28:01.109
<i>Number four:</i>

1:28:01.610 --> 1:28:03.069
She thinks you're a good person.

1:28:04.571 --> 1:28:05.530
No, she doesn't.

1:28:05.614 --> 1:28:06.490
She told me.

1:28:07.532 --> 1:28:10.035
She told you
that she thinks that I'm good?

1:28:10.952 --> 1:28:13.705
You could write she's the only person
who thinks you're good.

1:28:15.999 --> 1:28:17.709
I never knew that she thought that.

1:28:18.460 --> 1:28:19.336
<i>Four:</i>

1:28:19.419 --> 1:28:22.672
<i>You're the only person in the world</i>
<i>who thinks I'm good.</i>

1:28:23.965 --> 1:28:24.800
<i>Five:</i>

1:28:25.550 --> 1:28:28.178
<i>You made me feel loved and safe.</i>

1:28:28.929 --> 1:28:29.763
<i>Six:</i>

1:28:30.347 --> 1:28:34.059
<i>You cut up fruit for my snacks</i>
<i>even when I begged for junk food.</i>

1:28:35.310 --> 1:28:36.144
<i>Seven:</i>

1:28:36.812 --> 1:28:39.731
<i>You still call me, even when I ignore you.</i>

1:28:40.565 --> 1:28:41.399
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:28:42.651 --> 1:28:43.485
<i>Eight:</i>

1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:46.279
<i>The only times I've ever seen you angry</i>

1:28:46.363 --> 1:28:49.115
<i>are times you deserved to be angrier.</i>

1:28:50.992 --> 1:28:51.827
<i>Nine:</i>

1:28:52.619 --> 1:28:53.870
<i>You love to dance.</i>

1:28:55.914 --> 1:28:56.748
<i>Ten:</i>

1:28:57.457 --> 1:28:58.500
<i>You're my mother.</i>

1:29:00.252 --> 1:29:01.086
<i>Eleven:</i>

1:29:01.962 --> 1:29:04.589
<i>You taught me there is room</i>
<i>in every story...</i>

1:29:05.590 --> 1:29:06.800
<i>for a better ending.</i>

1:29:23.942 --> 1:29:24.776
Erin!

1:29:27.863 --> 1:29:28.697
Erin!

1:29:30.198 --> 1:29:31.032
Erin!

1:29:33.243 --> 1:29:34.119
Erin!

1:29:36.121 --> 1:29:37.080
Erin!

1:29:39.833 --> 1:29:40.792
Erin!

1:29:45.463 --> 1:29:46.631
Erin, wait up!

1:29:50.927 --> 1:29:51.761
I really...

1:29:51.845 --> 1:29:52.679
I need to...

1:29:53.013 --> 1:29:54.347
get to the gym more often.

1:29:54.431 --> 1:29:55.765
What are you doing?

1:29:56.016 --> 1:29:57.142
What are you doing?

1:29:57.225 --> 1:29:58.435
I'm moving to L.A.

1:29:58.894 --> 1:29:59.728
Well...

1:30:01.479 --> 1:30:03.565
-Can I talk to you first?
-About what?

1:30:03.648 --> 1:30:04.649
About us.

1:30:04.733 --> 1:30:05.609
Oh, my...

1:30:05.692 --> 1:30:08.361
It's too late, Daniel.
My whole life is in this truck.

1:30:09.529 --> 1:30:11.740
That's funny.
I was just thinking the same thing.

1:30:13.992 --> 1:30:15.160
You're not gonna stop me.

1:30:16.745 --> 1:30:17.579
Okay.

1:30:18.246 --> 1:30:19.080
Okay.

1:30:21.541 --> 1:30:23.084
Can we talk on the way?

1:30:23.627 --> 1:30:25.420
-You don't have anything to do?
-Please.

1:30:25.795 --> 1:30:28.256
-You're gonna drive me to L.A.?
-I'm coming to L.A.

1:30:28.632 --> 1:30:29.841
I'm coming with you.

1:30:30.467 --> 1:30:31.509
Coming to L.A.

1:30:32.510 --> 1:30:33.345
I'm sorry.

1:30:33.428 --> 1:30:34.304
Sorry!

1:30:34.387 --> 1:30:35.263
I'm sorry.

1:30:37.641 --> 1:30:38.767
I'm sorry, too.

1:30:41.269 --> 1:30:44.481
-Do you know how to drive one of these?
-I have no idea what I'm doing.

1:31:01.998 --> 1:31:03.249
Hey, where you going?

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:06.878
I swear she looks like both of you.

1:31:06.962 --> 1:31:09.214
To be honest,
we think she looks like your mother.

1:31:09.714 --> 1:31:10.548
Acts like it.

1:31:11.549 --> 1:31:13.927
-Oh, my goodness!
-Speaking of the devil.

1:31:14.010 --> 1:31:16.680
-Or angel, depending who you ask.
-Who's that?

1:31:16.888 --> 1:31:18.974
Grandma loves Ella!

1:31:19.057 --> 1:31:20.141
Yay, look who it is!

1:31:20.225 --> 1:31:21.851
-Grandma!
-There's Grandma!

1:31:21.935 --> 1:31:23.228
-Say hi to Grandma.
-And you,

1:31:23.311 --> 1:31:25.689
-and you, and you.
-Hi.

1:31:26.147 --> 1:31:27.148
-And you.
-Hi.

1:31:28.858 --> 1:31:31.820
This is kind of a complicated garment,
isn't it?

1:31:31.903 --> 1:31:35.240
My mother's at her son's semi-Jewish
wedding, and she's still complaining.

1:31:35.323 --> 1:31:37.826
You're not supposed to see the bride
before the wedding.

1:31:37.909 --> 1:31:41.162
I know, but we broke a few rules already.
I think we can break one more.

1:31:41.746 --> 1:31:43.873
Well, he's got a point. We can show him.

1:31:53.091 --> 1:31:54.092
Thanks, Ma.

1:31:55.301 --> 1:31:56.219
For everything.

1:32:04.144 --> 1:32:05.478
No one's gonna notice.

1:32:07.272 --> 1:32:09.399
There's just one little thing, though.

1:32:10.525 --> 1:32:12.110
It's too late for a thing.

1:32:12.193 --> 1:32:15.447
I know,
but this is really an important thing.

1:32:16.072 --> 1:32:18.116
I think we should rehearse the kiss again.

1:32:19.909 --> 1:32:21.494
Hi!

1:32:32.964 --> 1:32:36.092
I'm still so angry,
I can barely stand to look at you.

1:32:36.468 --> 1:32:38.386
I know. Thank you for the invitation.

1:32:38.470 --> 1:32:40.680
I invited Frank. You're his plus one.

1:32:41.181 --> 1:32:43.558
-Did you get my messages?
-Yeah, about 20 of them.

1:32:43.641 --> 1:32:46.603
-Did you get my texts?
-"Stop calling me."

1:32:47.562 --> 1:32:48.396
You know...

1:32:49.355 --> 1:32:52.484
I am kind of responsible
for this whole wedding.

1:32:52.567 --> 1:32:54.944
I mean, if we hadn't gone to New York...

1:32:55.278 --> 1:32:58.031
So, now we're considering that trip
a success?

1:32:58.114 --> 1:33:00.158
Well, look at where we are, and...

1:33:00.241 --> 1:33:02.494
And Carol's in Italy.

1:33:02.869 --> 1:33:04.621
She didn't even RSVP.

1:33:04.704 --> 1:33:07.624
She's probably too busy painting,
eating pizza,

1:33:08.166 --> 1:33:10.251
taking Italian lovers...

1:33:10.335 --> 1:33:13.296
I'm sure she's miserable
since she sold that house.

1:33:18.510 --> 1:33:20.178
Don't start the wedding without us!

1:33:21.721 --> 1:33:22.889
I knew she would come!

1:33:22.972 --> 1:33:25.558
I missed her so much more
than I missed you.

1:33:25.642 --> 1:33:27.018
Same here. Only double.

1:33:27.727 --> 1:33:29.395
Oh, it's just his date.

1:33:30.063 --> 1:33:33.024
She's too old to be his date.
She's, like, his age.

1:33:37.362 --> 1:33:39.197
Oh, my God!

1:33:39.572 --> 1:33:41.574
Oh, my God!

1:33:42.992 --> 1:33:43.827
Yes!

1:33:48.748 --> 1:33:50.291
I heard there was cake.

1:33:50.375 --> 1:33:52.252
You don't call, you don't write.

1:33:52.335 --> 1:33:54.712
Oh, we missed you so much!

1:33:55.505 --> 1:33:58.049
-You look so glamorous.
-So do you.

1:33:59.717 --> 1:34:02.428
By the way, I brought bourbon.

1:34:03.096 --> 1:34:05.140
Oh, no! Not again!

1:34:05.223 --> 1:34:07.183
Of course you did.

1:36:22.777 --> 1:36:23.611
Yeah.

1:36:38.084 --> 1:36:39.043
You're driving.

1:37:25.256 --> 1:37:26.090
All right.

1:37:44.525 --> 1:37:45.651
Get out of the car!

1:37:47.570 --> 1:37:48.529
Let me out!

1:38:35.910 --> 1:38:37.245
Oh, I'm out of breath.
