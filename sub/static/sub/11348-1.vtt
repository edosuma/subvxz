male narrator: IN THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:05.206 --> 00:06.340
SEXUALLY-BASED OFFENSES
ARE CONSIDERED

00:06.374 --> 00:08.109
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.410
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.443 --> 00:11.345
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:11.379 --> 00:12.813
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.846 --> 00:14.548
KNOWN AS THE SPECIAL
VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.582 --> 00:18.219
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.554
- YOU READY, LITTLE MAN?

00:20.588 --> 00:23.291
YOU READY?

00:23.324 --> 00:25.626
THERE WE GO. SHH, SHH.

00:25.659 --> 00:29.163
GOOD NIGHT, SWEET NOAH.

00:29.197 --> 00:33.367
AW, YOU MISS YOUR MOMMY,
DON'T YOU?

00:33.401 --> 00:38.339
SHE HAD A HARD ROAD, HUH?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.174
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER
GONNA BE ABLE

00:40.208 --> 00:42.843
TO TELL YOU THIS STORY.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.247
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.416
SHE LOVED YOU.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.519
VERY, VERY MUCH.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.422
HER NAME WAS ELLIE.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.428
- SO THEY LET
LITTLE TINO STAY OUT?

01:00.461 --> 01:02.296
- BUT HE'S WEARING
A BRACELET, ELLIE.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.697
YOU'RE GONNA BE SAFE HERE.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.266
- WHEN DO I HAVE TO TESTIFY?

01:05.299 --> 01:06.567
- AT THE GRAND JURY TOMORROW.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.769
- AND THEN I'LL GET NOAH BACK?

01:08.802 --> 01:11.272
- YOU GOTTA FOCUS RIGHT NOW
ON GETTING CLEAN.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.374
YOU GOTTA FOCUS
ON WORKING YOUR PROGRAM.

01:13.407 --> 01:18.312
OKAY? YOU CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

01:18.346 --> 01:21.249
- I DON'T WANT NOAH TO GROW UP
IN FOSTER CARE LIKE I DID.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.552
I JUST WANT HIM TO BE SAFE,

01:24.585 --> 01:28.289
TO GROW UP KNOWING
THAT HE'S LOVED.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.292
- THEY MAY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.394
- IS IT HER?
- THE BODY'S BURNED UP

01:33.427 --> 01:34.828
PRETTY BAD.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.599
- IT'S ELLIE.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.772
COME ON, TINO. WHO DID IT?

01:44.805 --> 01:46.540
WHO GAVE THE ORDER?

01:46.574 --> 01:49.243
- I GREENLIT HER.
- NO WAY!

01:49.277 --> 01:51.545
YOU'RE DOING TIME, PLAYA,
25 TO LIFE.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.282
WHO'S PULLING YOUR STRINGS?

01:54.315 --> 01:57.418
- SERGEANT BENSON,
YOU RESCUED THE INFANT.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.220
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

01:59.253 --> 02:03.191
- IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU MIGHT LIKE TO BECOME

02:03.224 --> 02:04.825
A FOSTER MOTHER TO THIS BABY?

02:08.596 --> 02:13.201
- I'M STILL TRYING TO FIND THE
MAN THAT HURT YOUR MOM, NOAH.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.768
AND I HAVE...

02:17.305 --> 02:21.842
YOU HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS.

02:21.875 --> 02:25.779
AND I PROMISE YOU THIS.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.916
I'M NOT GONNA REST
UNTIL I GET HIM.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.188
- THEY DON'T TEACH YOU
EVERYTHING AT THE ACADEMY.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.724
THE BEST WAY TO WIN SOME FIGHTS
IS TO NEVER HAVE THEM.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.727
- THEY BRAINWASH YOU
AT ANGER MANAGEMENT?

02:39.760 --> 02:43.231
- FINE, TRY IT THE HARD WAY.

02:43.264 --> 02:48.236
NOW, LESSON TWO, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT PICTURE?

02:54.308 --> 02:55.743
AFTERNOON, SIR.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.811
LICENSE, REGISTRATION,
AND INSURANCE, PLEASE?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.647
- WHY, IS THERE A PROBLEM,
OFFICER?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.349
- YOU'RE PARKED IN FRONT
OF A HYDRANT,

03:01.382 --> 03:02.950
AND YOU'RE EXPOSING YOURSELF.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.818
YOU MIND ZIPPING UP
AND STEPPING OUT?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.420
BOTH OF YOU.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.322
HANDS ON THE HOOD.
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.224
I'M PARKED, ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND. YOU KNOW?

03:10.258 --> 03:11.859
I MEAN, IT'S BETTER
THAN ME GETTING SERVICED

03:11.892 --> 03:13.761
WHILE I'M DRIVING, RIGHT?
- THAT'S GREAT.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.264
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT SAFETY.
AND YOUR GIRL, WHAT'S HER NAME?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.399

03:25.138 --> 03:26.807
MY WIFE--
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.809
- GIVE ME MY PURSE!
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING!

03:28.842 --> 03:30.978
- DON'T LIE TO ME, CHICA!
- HEY, HEY!

03:31.011 --> 03:32.713
YOU MOVE, YOU LOSE YOUR CAR.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.648
EASY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN.
CALM DOWN.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.917
EASY. HEY, CALM DOWN.
HEY, JUST BREATHE.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.486
- GIVE ME MY PURSE!

03:38.519 --> 03:41.589
EASY.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.458
HE'LL FRIGGIN' KILL ME.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.972
- YOU CAN HELP YOURSELF

MY PARTNER'S PROCESSING HER NOW.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.978
GUAPO, YOU DONE WITH THE EMPATHY

04:05.012 --> 04:08.816
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?
- YO. WHAT'S UP?

04:08.849 --> 04:12.019
- HOW ARE YOU?
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU CALLED.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.055
I'VE JUST BEEN BUSY, YOU KNOW,
PULLING AS MUCH OT AS I CAN.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.990
- WE KNOW HOW IT IS.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.859
- YOU WON'T BE HERE
FOR MUCH LONGER.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.295
LISTEN, THIS GIRL YOU
BROUGHT IN, LUNA GARCIA.

04:21.329 --> 04:24.064
- YEAH, SHE'S UNDERAGE.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.567
HER PRINTS CAME IN FROM INS
A HALF HOUR AGO.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.369
- SHE'S ALSO A MATERIAL WITNESS

04:28.402 --> 04:31.339
IN THE RAPE HOMICIDE
OF ELLIE PORTER.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.541
- NOAH'S MOM? DOES LIV KNOW?

04:33.574 --> 04:36.477
- THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
- MY PARTNER DID THE PAPERWORK.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.046
IF I'D SEEN THE WANT CARD,
I'D HAVE CALLED RIGHT AWAY.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.782
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
A RAPPORT WITH LUNA,

04:41.815 --> 04:42.850
IF YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO HER.

04:42.883 --> 04:46.354
- LIV WANTS US TO BRING HER IN.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.022
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.
NO, I GET IT.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.058
- HERE.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.966

WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.034
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE, HONEY.
WE JUST NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.770
[gunshot]
- OH!

05:04.505 --> 05:05.939

05:07.741 --> 05:08.976
- POLICE! DROP THE GUN!

05:11.912 --> 05:13.847
[tires screeching]

05:18.386 --> 05:21.355

05:27.060 --> 05:30.030
[dramatic music]

06:13.741 --> 06:13.941
.

06:13.974 --> 06:14.975
- WHERE'S THE SHOOTER?
- AT THE HOSPITAL WITH FIN.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.879
THE GIRL, LUNA, IS IN INTERVIEW.
SHE IS SHAKEN UP.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.648
- HOW'D THEY KNOW YOU WERE
PICKING HER UP?

06:20.681 --> 06:22.550
- AMARO THINKS THAT THEY WERE
FOLLOWED TO THE PRECINCT.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.817
- AMARO?
- YEAH.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.686
HE WAS THE ARRESTING OFFICER.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.987
- THEY SHOT AT COPS
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE STATION?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.656
SO THEY WANT US TO KNOW
THEY'RE CRAZY.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.491
- YOU MUST BE MY NEW DETECTIVE.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.159
- DOMINICK CARISI, JR.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.595
CALL ME SONNY.
I BROUGHT ZEPPOLI.

06:34.628 --> 06:38.499
- I ASKED FOR AN EXPERIENCED,
EMPATHIC DETECTIVE

06:38.532 --> 06:41.435
AND THEY SENT YOU?
- I'M WAY EXPERIENCED.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.870
SENSITIVE AND MOODY, TOO.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.072
AND I CAN DO
THAT WHOLE EMPATHY THING.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.508
- WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.577
- STATEN ISLAND SVU
FOR TWO MONTHS,

06:49.610 --> 06:52.713
AND BROOKLYN FOR ALMOST A MONTH,
AND THEN QUEENS LAST WEEK.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.915
- SO THEY LOVE YOU WHEREVER
YOU GO, CARISI?

06:54.948 --> 06:57.217
- CALL ME SONNY. I WAS
SUPPOSED TO START TOMORROW,

06:57.250 --> 06:59.119
BUT I HEARD ABOUT
THE SHOOTING OVER MY SCANNER,

06:59.152 --> 07:00.120
SO I CAME IN.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.556
WHAT'S OUR READ?

07:02.590 --> 07:06.594
- THE 116 HAD A WITNESS
OF AN OPEN CASE.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.629
THEY TOOK A SHOT AT HER.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.465
- THE GIRL GIVING THE SMOOTHIE
TO THE MOOK IN A MINIVAN?

07:11.499 --> 07:13.534
WHAT'S SHE A WITNESS TO?
- A FEW MONTHS AGO,

07:13.567 --> 07:15.969
A TRAFFICKED GIRL WAS GANG-RAPED
AND SET ON FIRE.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.471
- THE ELLIE PORTER CASE.
- YEAH.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.206
- I REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT IT.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.074
HER PIMP GREENLIT HER, RIGHT?
- LITTLE TINO.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.143
HE TOOK THE RAP, BUT WE DON'T
THINK HE ORDERED THE HIT.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.778
- SO THIS GIRL'S HOOKING
FOR THE SAME CREW,

07:24.812 --> 07:26.714
AND YOU THINK THAT SHE'S
GONNA GIVE UP MR. BIG.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.716
WANT ME TO TAKE A RUN AT HER,
SERGEANT?

07:28.749 --> 07:31.251
- I CAN CERTAINLY SEE
WHY YOU'RE SO POPULAR.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.755
ROLLINS, HOW ABOUT YOU TALK
TO THE JOHN.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.157
AND, CARISI, COME WITH ME.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.093
I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW MY LEAD
OR YOU'LL BE OH FOR FOUR,

07:40.127 --> 07:42.496
AND THEN YOUR ALL-BOROUGH TOUR
OF SVU

07:42.530 --> 07:45.566
WILL CONTINUE IN THE BRONX.

07:45.599 --> 07:49.603
- MY SON HAS SOCCER TOMORROW.
I NEED MY CAR BACK.

07:49.637 --> 07:52.840
- I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.876
YOUR GIRL WAS 16.
- WELL, SHE DIDN'T FINISH.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.878
OK? 'CAUSE WE GOT INTERRUPTED.
SO THAT--

07:57.911 --> 08:02.282
- SEE, RIGHT THERE, YOU JUST
CONFESSED TO STATUTORY RAPE.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.818
OKAY, SO HOW'D YOU
MAKE THE DATE?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.554
- CRAIGSLIST.
YOU CALL THE NUMBER,

08:06.587 --> 08:07.655
AND THEN THEY COME IN A CAR,

08:07.688 --> 08:10.891
AND SHE GETS IN THE CAR WITH ME.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.527
- COULDN'T GET A ROOM?
THAT'S CLASSY.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.195
- WELL, THAT COSTS
A LOT OF MONEY. OKAY?

08:15.228 --> 08:17.798
AND I HAVE TWO CHILDREN
IN CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.734
YOU EVER DATE THIS GIRL?
SHE GOES BY THE NAME LISETTE.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.303
OR MAYBE ELLIE.
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.807
I'M NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION
TO THEIR FACES, SO...

08:26.840 --> 08:28.576
- YOU WANT TO LOOK AGAIN?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.146
- I DON'T KNOW HER.
- YEAH, YOU DO, LUNA.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.849
YOU LIVED WITH HER.
WE FOUND YOUR PASSPORT

08:35.883 --> 08:38.819
WHEN WE RAIDED
LITTLE TINO'S MOM'S HOUSE.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.121
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO ELLIE?

08:41.154 --> 08:43.223
- JUST PUT ME IN JAIL.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.559
- LUNA, LISTEN TO ME.

08:45.593 --> 08:49.296
THEY TOOK A SHOT AT YOU,
THEY WANT YOU DEAD.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.298
THEY KILLED ELLIE.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.567
NOW IF YOU WORK WITH US,

08:53.601 --> 08:56.704
IF YOU TALK WITH US, WE CAN
MAKE SURE THAT YOU STAY SAFE.

08:56.737 --> 09:00.641
- SAFE AS YOU CAN BE.
ANYWAY.

09:00.674 --> 09:04.211
SHE'S NOT GONNA TALK TO US
IF WE KEEP BLOWING SMOKE.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.979
- UM...

09:06.013 --> 09:11.284
- HOW LONG YOU BEEN
ON THE STREETS? ONE YEAR, TWO?

09:11.318 --> 09:14.622
SIX MONTHS BEFORE THAT, YOU'RE
IN MEXICO GETTING TURNED OUT.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.256
YOU HAVE ANY HOPE LEFT?

09:16.289 --> 09:17.958
YOU STILL PRAYING
TO OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE

09:17.991 --> 09:20.594
EVERY NIGHT,
ASKING HER FORGIVENESS?

09:20.628 --> 09:23.797
[speaking Spanish]
- CARISI, WOULD YOU BE SO KIND

09:23.831 --> 09:25.733
TO GET MS. GARCIA
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

09:25.766 --> 09:27.267
- I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW HER!

09:27.300 --> 09:28.902
- OKAY, NO PROBLEM, SARGE.

09:28.936 --> 09:32.773
BUT BEFORE I GO,
[speaks Spanish]

09:32.806 --> 09:34.975
THAT WASN'T A WARNING SHOT.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.344
YOUR PAPI GREENLIT YOUR ASS.
- HEY, THAT'S NOT HELPFUL.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.279
- YOU ASK ME,
YOU GOT ONE HOPE,

09:39.312 --> 09:42.315
T-NONIMMIGRANT STATUS
FOR TRAFFICKED GIRLS.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.986
YOU GET A NEW IDENTITY,
YOU MOVE TO A NEW CITY.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.623
WELCOME TO AMERICA.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.793
NOW I CAN PULL THOSE STRINGS
AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN,

09:52.826 --> 09:56.730
BUT YOU HAVE
TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

09:56.764 --> 10:01.068
AT LEAST WE CAN
OFFER YOU A CHANCE.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.270
BUT THAT'S ALL IT IS,
IT'S A CHANCE.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.076
- [speaks Spanish]

10:09.109 --> 10:12.412
- IT'S US OR THEM.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.349
WE WANT YOU TO LIVE, LUNA.

10:16.383 --> 10:21.121
THEY DON'T.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.356
- SI.
- AND MY PARTNER HERE

10:23.390 --> 10:26.760
IS GONNA GET YOU
THAT DRINK THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.800
YOU GOT PRETTY LUCKY IN THERE,
PROMISING HER "T" STATUS.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.267
WHAT ARE YOU,
AN IMMIGRATION LAWYER?

10:34.301 --> 10:37.004
- HALFWAY THERE.
NIGHT SCHOOL, FORDHAM LAW.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.406
I JUST DID A TERM PAPER
ON "T" NONIMMIGRANT STATUS.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.441
SHE'S A GOOD CANDIDATE.
- SO YOU DID A PAPER,

10:41.474 --> 10:43.310
AND NOW YOU TOLD HER
THAT YOU HAVE PULL?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.946
- IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER IF
I'M ACTUALLY TELLING THE TRUTH.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.414
I MEAN,
I GOT HER TO BELIEVE I AM.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.083
- LOOK, THAT MAY WORK
IN STATEN ISLAND,

10:50.117 --> 10:52.352
BUT THAT'S NOT
HOW WE DO THINGS HERE. OKAY?

10:52.385 --> 10:54.154
- MY APOLOGIES, SERGEANT.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.056
BUT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
TO ELLIE PORTER,

10:56.089 --> 10:57.324
SHE KNOWS WE CAN'T
KEEP HER SAFE.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.359
- SO YOU SCARE HER?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.695
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT
EMPATHY THING YOU DO?

11:01.729 --> 11:05.999
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
SHE GOT EMPATHY FROM A MAN?

11:06.033 --> 11:07.868
I MEAN, SHE'S USED TO A PIMP
TELLING HER WHAT TO DO.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.737
TO HER, A NICE GUY
IS JUST PLAYING HER.

11:09.770 --> 11:14.274
- FINE. JUST GET HER TO TALK.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.309
OKAY, GUYS,
SO WHERE ARE WE AT?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.477
DID YOU GET ANYTHING
FROM OUR JOHN?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.079
- LOOKS LIKE THE SAME SETUP

11:19.112 --> 11:20.981
AS LITTLE TINO'S OPERATION.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.150
BURNER CELL PHONES,
CRAIGSLIST ADS.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.285
- BUT LITTLE TINO'S IN JAIL.
THIS IS ANOTHER FRANCHISE.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.920
- OKAY.
SO WHAT ABOUT THE SHOOTER?

11:26.954 --> 11:29.056
- DIEGO RAMIREZ.
HE SOMEHOW MANAGED

11:29.089 --> 11:31.424
TO LAWYER UP WHILE STILL
IN SURGERY. NO RECORD.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.394
- BUT HIS PRINTS MATCH
ONES ON THE GAS CAN

11:34.427 --> 11:36.463
FOUND AT ELLIE'S MURDER.
- SO HE WAS THERE.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.265
DID HE RAPE HER?
- WE'RE WAITING ON THAT.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.233
- I KNOW WHY LUNA
DOESN'T NEED A LAWYER.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.302
SHE'S GOT A MOUTH ON HER.
- DID YOU GET ANYTHING?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.137
- I GOT THE ADDRESS OF THE
HOUSE SHE'S WORKING OUT OF.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.305
- BUT DID YOU GET HER PIMP?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.373
- IT'S TOO SOON TO ASK.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.507
- SO YOU GOT NOTHING.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.909
- I'M TRYING TO BUILD A RAPPORT.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.010
JUST STAKE OUT THE HOUSE,

11:50.043 --> 11:51.912
YOU'LL FIND HIM.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.281
- WHO'RE YOU?

11:54.314 --> 11:56.349
- DETECTIVE TUTUOLA,
MEET SONNY CARISI.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.418
REMEMBER THAT SENSITIVE,
EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE

11:58.451 --> 12:00.153
THAT I PUT IN FOR?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.089
- SO WHO DO WE CALL
FOR A WARRANT?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.423
- EASY THERE, COWBOY.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.892
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN DOWN
ONE HOUSE,

12:04.925 --> 12:06.293
AND ALL WE GOT WAS HOUSE.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.128
THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER
GOING ON HERE.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.397
- MAYBE WE DO STAKE IT OUT,
PUT A U.C. INSIDE?

12:10.430 --> 12:12.399
- COOL. THEY DON'T KNOW ME.
HOW ABOUT I DO IT?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.267
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
HOW ABOUT WE GO WITH SOMEBODY

12:14.301 --> 12:17.370
THAT THEY DO KNOW,
AND SOMEBODY THAT THEY ALSO KNOW

12:17.404 --> 12:20.107
HAS A GRUDGE AGAINST NYPD.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.456
[siren chirps]

12:46.499 --> 12:48.301
- LICENSE, REGISTRATION,
INSURANCE.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.003
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THE DEAL.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.339
- THE DEAL IS
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.208
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEAR.
- EXCUSE ME?

12:55.242 --> 12:57.277
- LISTEN, JOAQUIN MENENDEZ,
I COULD CITE YOU

12:57.310 --> 12:59.112
FOR ROLLING
THROUGH THE STOP SIGN,

12:59.146 --> 13:00.280
I COULD TOSS YOUR CAR
AND PLANT DRUGS,

13:00.313 --> 13:01.949
OR WE CAN JUST DISCUSS
WHAT'S GOING ON

13:01.982 --> 13:03.350
IN THAT HOUSE BACK THERE.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.118
- HEH.

13:05.152 --> 13:09.289
SO THIS IS A SHAKEDOWN.
MAYBE I SHOULD CALL MY ABOGADO.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.392
- NO, NO, NO. [speaks Spanish]
HEAR ME OUT.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.594
WE BOTH KNOW YOU HAVE
WORKING GIRLS IN THERE.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.464
[speaks Spanish]

13:17.497 --> 13:19.332
- AND WHERE DID YOU
HEAR THIS FROM?

13:19.366 --> 13:23.236
- FRIENDS AT SVU.
I MEAN, MAYBE I CAN GIVE YOU

13:23.270 --> 13:24.905
A HEADS UP WHEN YOU NEED IT,

13:24.938 --> 13:27.074
AND YOU CAN HELP ME
WITH MY ALIMONY.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.441
- I'LL JUST TAKE THE TICKET.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.244
- YOU NEED PROOF?

13:31.278 --> 13:33.313
I'LL GIVE YOU
SOMETHING FOR FREE.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.316
YOU'RE GETTING RAIDED TONIGHT.
HERE'S YOUR LICENSE.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.451
THAT'S MY CARD.
BURNER CELL IS ON THE BACK.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.921
CALL ME WHEN
YOU'RE READY TO DEAL.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.458
- HEY, AMARO.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.495
AREN'T YOU THE ONE
THAT BEAT UP THAT CHOMO?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.597
AND NOW THEY GOT YOU
DOING TRAFFIC STOPS

13:50.630 --> 13:53.233
OUT HERE IN QUEENS.
- FINE.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.902
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE TOO STUPID
TO BELIEVE ME

13:54.935 --> 13:57.437
AND YOU GET SNATCHED UP,
LOOK FOR EL MORENO.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.140
TELL HIM WE'RE FRIENDS.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.442
DRIVE SAFELY, JOAQUIN.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.380
- POLICE!
WE'RE CLEAR!

14:07.414 --> 14:09.149
NOBODY MOVE!

14:09.182 --> 14:11.084
- LET'S SEE YOUR HANDS!
- CLEAR THAT ROOM.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.385
- STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.121
- HANDS IN THE AIR!
HANDS IN THE AIR!

14:14.154 --> 14:15.222
- COME ON, COME ON.
GO TAKE HER.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.257
YOU, YOU CHECK THE BACK.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.892
- DON'T MOVE!
GET OVER THERE!

14:18.926 --> 14:21.661
- YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.
- IT'S OKAY.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.965
GIRLS, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.535
SEE, LOOK. IT'S OKAY. COME.
COME ON OUT, IT'S OKAY.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.572
YOU'RE OKAY.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.514
- NOT ONE MORE STEP, AMIGO.
YOU STAY RIGHT THERE.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.616
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
I GOT THIS, YOUNG BLOOD.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.385
ROLLINS FOUND SOME GIRLS
UPSTAIRS.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.555
SHE NEEDS YOU INSIDE.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.461
- HEY, IT'S ALL GOOD.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.197
YO, I'M A FRIEND OF NICK'S.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.033
- OKAY,
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

15:09.509 --> 15:09.909
.

15:09.943 --> 15:10.343
- CHOCOLATE MILK.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.048
THE REAL KIND, WITH SYRUP,
NOT POWDER.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.717
- I DON'T WANT THAT.
I'M NOT A KID.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.486
AND I'M WAITING
FOR MY LAWYER TO COME.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.055
- YOU THINK JOAQUIN
IS SENDING YOU A LAWYER?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.224
HE'S DOWNTOWN RIGHT NOW,
HE'S CLAIMING HE HAD NO IDEA

15:24.257 --> 15:26.293
YOU WERE TURNING TRICKS.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.496
- YOU'RE HOW OLD, 14?

15:29.529 --> 15:32.165
JUST TELL US WHAT HE'S DONE
TO YOU, HOW YOU GOT HERE.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.234
- I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
- NO.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.004
WE GOT YOUR PHONE.

15:37.037 --> 15:42.709
SO HOW ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER?
DOES SHE NEED OUR HELP?

15:42.742 --> 15:47.014
- WE RAIDED A HOUSE LAST MAY,
AND THERE WERE CHILDREN INSIDE.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.717
NOT SO TONIGHT.
WHERE'S YOUR BABY, MISSY?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.125
- CAN I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT?

15:59.759 --> 16:01.561
- I'LL ORDER YOU SOMETHING.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.001
[door opens, closes]

16:08.035 --> 16:11.638
- STILL NOT TALKING?
OKAY, SUIT YOURSELF.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.077
I'M OH FOR THREE.
- THESE GIRLS HAVE BEEN THROUGH

16:17.110 --> 16:18.578
SO MUCH,
THEY ARE SCARED TO DEATH.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.513
- AND THESE IDIOTS IN DC
WANT TO SEND THEM BACK

16:20.547 --> 16:23.083
BECAUSE THEY'RE "TERRORISTS
BRINGING OVER EBOLA."

16:23.116 --> 16:25.085
DID YOU GET ANYTHING FROM MISSY?
- NO, NOT YET.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.187
BUT BOY WONDER'S IN THERE
TALKING TO HER ABOUT HER BABY.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.788
- HER BABY?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.523
[exhales]
SHE'S, WHAT, 15?

16:30.557 --> 16:33.526
- 14. SHE GREW UP
IN FOSTER HOMES, SHE RAN AWAY.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.762
SHE GOT SEDUCED
BY SOME ROMEO PIMP,

16:35.795 --> 16:38.398
AND GOT TURNED OUT,
AND THEN SOLD TO JOAQUIN'S GANG.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.201
- JUST LIKE ELLIE.
- YOUR SETUP WORKED.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.670
AFTER I LET JOAQUIN GO,
HE CALLED UP AMARO

16:43.703 --> 16:45.138
AND TOLD HIM HE
OWED HIM A FAVOR.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.373
SAID HE'D PUT HIM ON RETAINER.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.041
- WELL, I'M GLAD
JOAQUIN'S HAPPY.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.676
DID WE GET ANYTHING
OUT OF THE RAID?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.778
- LOOK, TARU IS GOING THROUGH
THE GIRLS' CELL PHONES.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.047
THE NUMBERS MATCH
THE ONES ON THE CRAIGSLIST ADS.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.748
AND LOTS OF PHONE CALLS
FROM MIDTOWN HOTELS.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.784
- OH, GREAT.
- AND ANOTHER THING.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.519
ALL THE GIRLS HAD THE SAME APP

16:59.552 --> 17:00.820
FOR A SAME CAR SERVICE,
QUICKRIDE.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.655
- YOU'VE SEEN THE SIGNS.
"DRIVE FOR US,

17:02.689 --> 17:03.623
MAKE FOUR GRAND A MONTH."

17:03.656 --> 17:05.792
- I BET THEY'RE MAKING A LOT
MORE THAN THAT

17:05.825 --> 17:08.761
DRIVING AROUND OUT-CALLS.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.366
- A PROSTITUTION RING?
NOT AGAIN.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.302
MY BROTHER'S ON THE JOB
IN MIAMI, SO I KNOW

17:15.335 --> 17:18.438
HOW THESE THINGS WORK,
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN DO.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.373
- HOW ABOUT GIVING US THE NAMES
AND ADDRESSES

17:20.407 --> 17:22.609
TO THESE ACCOUNTS.
- WE DON'T RECORD THAT

17:22.642 --> 17:24.844
FOR PRIVACY REASONS.
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH UBER.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.214
I SPENT THREE YEARS BUILDING UP
THIS BUSINESS,

17:27.247 --> 17:29.349
I'M NOT GONNA SEE IT GO DOWN
BECAUSE DRIVERS WERE ARRESTED

17:29.382 --> 17:31.151
FOR HARASSING
FEMALE CUSTOMERS.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.552
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HOW ARE THE ACCOUNTS PAID?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.187
- SOME DIRECT DEPOSIT,

17:34.221 --> 17:37.324
SOME BILLED MONTHLY,
SOME BITCOIN.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.527
THESE ACCOUNTS,
ALL PAID BY AN OFFSHORE LLC.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.795
ADDRESS IS A PO BOX.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.732
- YOU MENTIONED EARLIER YOU'VE
HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE?

17:45.765 --> 17:48.501
- I HAD TO CLOSE AN ACCOUNT
ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.703
DRIVERS WERE COMPLAINING
ABOUT A MAN BEING ROUGH

17:50.737 --> 17:54.741
- WITH YOUNG GIRLS IN MY CARS.
- THIS GUY GOT A NAME?

17:54.774 --> 17:59.179
- TINO AGUILAR. HE WASN'T HAPPY
WHEN I CUT HIM OFF.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.648
A REAL BADASS.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.751
[security door buzzes]

18:04.784 --> 18:07.287
- BOTH THESE PIMPS USE QUICKRIDE
TO TRANSPORT THE GIRLS?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.189
- PAID FOR
BY A SHELL CORPORATION.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.524
AND SO FAR, FORENSIC ACCOUNTS
CAN'T TRACK IT DOWN.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.360
- SO WHY WOULD LITTLE TINO TALK?

18:13.393 --> 18:15.295
- AN ADA COMING ALL THE WAY
TO ATTICA?

18:15.328 --> 18:17.564
THAT MIGHT MAKE HIM
THINK HE CAN GET A DEAL.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.736
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
- YOUR GIRLS USED QUICKRIDE.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.240
WE JUST BUSTED ANOTHER HOUSE
THAT USED QUICKRIDE.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.776
IT'S THE SAME QUESTION,
LITTLE TINO.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.344
WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?

18:31.378 --> 18:34.814
- I'M ALREADY IN JAIL
FOR RAPE AND MURDER.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.517
YOU CAN GET ME OFF FROM THAT?
- I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.420
- YOU COOPERATE,
WITNESS PROTECTION

18:40.453 --> 18:44.457
IS ONE PHONE CALL AWAY.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.360
- IF I TALK, EVERYBODY'S GONNA
KNOW IT'S COMING FROM ME.

18:47.394 --> 18:50.530
- NO, THEY WON'T.
YOU HAVE COVER NOW.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.333
WE HAVE THE OTHER HOUSE,
WE HAVE THE CAR SERVICE.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.468
WE HAVE A SHOOTER IN CUSTODY
RIGHT NOW FOR TRYING

18:55.502 --> 18:56.736
TO TAKE OUT
ONE OF THE WORKING GIRLS.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.805
SOMEBODY'S GONNA
GIVE UP YOUR BOSS.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.208
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
THAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.876
- BUT NONE OF THOSE WITNESSES
TALKED YET?

19:03.910 --> 19:04.911
DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU SOMETHING?

19:04.944 --> 19:09.849
- WHO ORDERED ELLIE KILLED?

19:09.882 --> 19:12.919
- WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED
ABOUT THAT DEAD WHORE?

19:12.952 --> 19:14.854
IT WORKED OUT PRETTY GOOD
FOR YOU.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.292
- EXCUSE ME?

19:19.326 --> 19:23.363
- I HEARD YOU GOT A BABY
OUT OF IT.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.866
- WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- YOU LOVE THAT LITTLE BABY?

19:28.635 --> 19:31.738
- OH.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.941
- ARE YOU STUPID ENOUGH
TO THREATEN A SERGEANT'S FAMILY

19:34.974 --> 19:38.811
IN FRONT OF A DA
WHEN HE'S OFFERING YOU A DEAL?

19:38.845 --> 19:42.349
- ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IF I WAS YOU,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.651
I'D LEAVE THIS ALONE.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.654
SOME OF YOUR OWN GUYS
ARE WORKING AGAINST YOU.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.835
- MY TURN TO BUY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:02.869 --> 20:05.772
- I WANT YOU TO STAY IN THE CAR.
DON'T TEXT.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.508
- I'LL TAKE AN ICED COFFEE,
LIGHT AND SWEET.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.743
- KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE STREET.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.753
YOU DONE WITH THIS PAPER?

20:24.991 --> 20:28.261
YOUR SHOOTER, DIEGO,
IS IN RECOVERY.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.630
HE'S LOOKING FOR A DEAL.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.332
HE DON'T KNOW NOTHING.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.933
AND MY GIRLS YOU SNATCHED UP
AT THE HOUSE,

20:33.966 --> 20:35.902
THEY'RE ALL LAWYERED UP
AND OUT ON BAIL.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.837
SO I GOT NO WORRIES.

20:37.870 --> 20:41.007
- YOU KNOW A GUY
NAMED LITTLE TINO?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.276
THE DA'S LEANING ON HIM.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.578
WENT UP TO ATTICA, TOLD HIM
IF SOMEONE ELSE TALKS FIRST,

20:45.612 --> 20:47.347
TINO SPENDS THE REST OF HIS LIFE
IN PRISON.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.449
- TINO'S COOPERATING?

20:49.482 --> 20:52.752
- THESE KEEP COMING, I MAKE
A FEW CALLS AND FIND OUT.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.288
BUT IF TINO DOES TURN, YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE THE LAST MAN IN.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.725

21:51.511 --> 21:52.745
DO WE STILL HAVE EYES

21:58.851 --> 22:00.086
HE'S GONE.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.754

MISSY, THAT KID,

22:01.788 --> 22:03.356

23:15.027 --> 23:17.430
THEY THINK HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO SCARE EVERYONE.

23:17.464 --> 23:20.900
- IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.102
IT'S OKAY.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.605
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.907
LET'S GET YOU INSIDE,

23:27.940 --> 23:31.611
DIEGO RAMIREZ
GOT A HOTSHOT IN BELLEVUE.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.113
MISSY BROOKS,
EXECUTED ALONG WITH A JOHN.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.616
LOOKS LIKE HE WAS JUST
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.618
AND LITTLE TINO, CRITICAL.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.588
STILL IN SURGERY,
SHIVVED NINE TIMES.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.523
- AND NOAH. AND LUCY.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.793
A SHOOTER
OPENED UP AT THE PLAYGROUND.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.961
- YOU OKAY, LIV?

23:48.995 --> 23:51.197
WE SHOULD GET THEM
OUT OF THE CITY.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.466
- THERE'S A DETAIL ON THEM AND
WE'VE ALREADY PICKED UP LUNA.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.468
NOW, WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW

23:55.502 --> 23:57.136
IS FIND OUT WHOEVER
ORDERED THESE HITS,

23:57.169 --> 23:59.171
STARTING WITH JOAQUIN.
- WE KNOW HOW THIS STARTED.

23:59.205 --> 24:02.509
AMARO MET WITH JOAQUIN AND AN
HOUR LATER THE KNIVES COME OUT?

24:02.542 --> 24:04.544
SOMEHOW HE GOT THAT MESSAGE
TO HIS BOSS.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.778
- HOW? WE HAD JOAQUIN'S PHONE
TAPPED,

24:05.812 --> 24:07.780
HE WAS UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

24:07.814 --> 24:11.684
- TELL AMARO TO SET UP A MEET
WITH JOAQUIN.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.753
THE SECOND THOSE TWO SIT DOWN,
YOU BRING THEM BOTH IN.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.689
- YOU WANNA ARREST NICK?

24:16.723 --> 24:19.191
- IT HAS TO LOOK GOOD.
- I KNOW.

24:19.225 --> 24:22.562
- ANYTHING ELSE?

24:22.595 --> 24:26.833
- MISSY WAS KILLED IN RICHMOND
HILL IN A JOHN'S CAR.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.101
I'M WONDERING HOW SHE GOT THERE.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.503
HOW ABOUT I GO TALK

24:36.909 --> 24:38.545
ANGEL PEREZ?

24:40.747 --> 24:42.181
ANGEL PEREZ?

24:42.214 --> 24:44.283
- GET OUT. I'M NOT TALKING.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.285
THEY DID A NUMBER ON THIS PLACE.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.287
- I WOULD THINK YOU'D WANT US
TO CATCH THESE GUYS.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.523
- ONE OF YOUR DRIVERS
MAY HAVE DROPPED OFF A GIRL

24:50.557 --> 24:53.726
WHO WAS MURDERED YESTERDAY.
- HEY! YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.896
HE SAID GET OUT.
THIS ONLY HAPPENED

24:56.929 --> 24:58.698
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND TALKED
TO THOSE DETECTIVES.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.033
SO LEAVE US ALONE.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.238
- MAN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

25:06.272 --> 25:07.674
I GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF NAMES

25:07.707 --> 25:09.275
AND YOU PUT HITS OUT
ON ALL OF THEM?

25:09.308 --> 25:11.243
TAKE POTSHOTS AT MY
FORMER SERGEANT'S KID?

25:11.277 --> 25:13.245
- I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
- YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?

25:13.279 --> 25:14.714
TELL ME WHO PUT THESE HITS OUT,

25:14.747 --> 25:15.948
OR I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN
RIGHT HERE.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.784
WHO WAS IT? WHO DID IT?

25:17.817 --> 25:19.251
- WHO YOU THINK
YOU TALKING TO?

25:19.285 --> 25:21.087
- I KNOW WHO I'M TALKING TO.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.023
- YOU TAKE ME DOWN,
I'M BRINGING YOU DOWN WITH ME.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.593
A COP ON THE TAKE, SETTING
UP WITNESSES TO BE KILLED.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.862
THAT'D BE THE FINAL NAIL
IN YOUR COFFIN.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.564
PLEASURE DOING
BUSINESS WITH YOU.

25:31.598 --> 25:32.865
- NO, MAN.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.133
FROM ME!

25:34.166 --> 25:36.636
JOAQUIN MENENDEZ, NICK AMARO!

25:36.669 --> 25:37.837
BACK UP, GET YOUR HANDS
UP IN THE AIR.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.238
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
- HANDS UP!

25:39.271 --> 25:40.807
- WE DON'T NEED TO DO THIS HERE,
GUYS.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.609
HEY, COME ON.
- TURN AROUND.

25:42.642 --> 25:47.013
- LOOK, I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL.
- NOT ANYMORE.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.915
- COME ON.

25:48.948 --> 25:51.317
- LET'S GO.

25:51.350 --> 25:55.955
- THIS IS BULL.
YOUR DIRTY COP AMARO SET ME UP.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.090
- SIT DOWN!

25:58.124 --> 25:59.826
- HE HAD ALL THE NAMES.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.961
- SHUT UP!

26:01.994 --> 26:04.931
WHO ORDERED THE HITS?
- I GOT NO IDEA.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.799
- NO IDEA. OKAY.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.636
SO WHY DON'T WE START
WITH AN EASY QUESTION, HUH?

26:09.669 --> 26:12.739
WHO GREENLIT ELLIE?

26:12.772 --> 26:15.975
WE KNOW THAT IT
WASN'T LITTLE TINO.

26:16.008 --> 26:19.278
SO WHO WAS IT?

26:19.311 --> 26:22.281
WHO WAS IT?

26:22.314 --> 26:25.818
- WHY THE HELL YOU CARE SO MUCH?

26:25.852 --> 26:29.255
OH, WAIT.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.623
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HAS HER KID.

26:30.657 --> 26:33.125
- WAS IT YOU WHO TOOK THE SHOT?

26:33.159 --> 26:34.827
YOU TRIED TO KILL NOAH?

26:34.861 --> 26:36.162
YOU WON'T MAKE IT OUT
OF CENTRAL BOOKING.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.363
- DON'T PUT THAT ON ME.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.298
- I DON'T CARE IF YOU DID IT

26:39.331 --> 26:43.302
OR YOU KNOW WHO DID IT.
THIS ONE'S ON YOU.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.871
- SERGEANT.
- AND I PROMISE YOU,

26:44.904 --> 26:46.706
YOU BETTER START TALKING,

26:46.739 --> 26:48.641
OR THEY'RE GONNA FIND
YOU HANGING IN YOUR CELL.

26:52.879 --> 26:55.882
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.356
- HEY, LIV.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.858
WE JUST GOT A CALL FROM ATTICA.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.394
LITTLE TINO IS CONSCIOUS.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.997
- GOOD. WE GOT HIM.
THANK YOU.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.232
[security door buzzes]

27:13.265 --> 27:14.867

MS. AGUILAR. OKAY? STEP ASIDE.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.845
- LIKE HELL.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.014
HE TALKS TO YOU AGAIN,
HE'S DEAD.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.182
- HE DIDN'T TALK, AND THEY
ALREADY TRIED TO KILL HIM.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.318
YOU WANT TO KEEP HIM ALIVE,
TELL US WHO HIS BOSS IS.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.253
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.956
- I GUESS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
TO TALK ABOUT.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.227
- WAIT.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.395
- WHAT,
YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO US?

27:43.429 --> 27:45.331
- YEAH.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.838
I DON'T DEAL WITH THE BOSS.

27:51.871 --> 27:56.175
BUT I HAVE DEALT
WITH HIS BOTTOM. SELENA.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.944
- HOW DO WE GET IN TOUCH
WITH HER?

27:57.977 --> 28:00.312
- SELENA'S THE ONE
THAT BREAKS IN THE NEW GIRLS.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.414
I HEARD THERE'S A NEW ONE UP,

28:02.448 --> 28:05.952

28:40.519 --> 28:44.256
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO FOR ME?

28:44.290 --> 28:48.360
- WHATEVER YOU WANT.
MASSAGE IS 200.

28:48.394 --> 28:52.231
- MASSAGE? THAT'S A JOKE, RIGHT?

28:52.264 --> 28:54.867
I DIDN'T CALL YOU FOR A MASSAGE.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.403
- JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S BETTER.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.305
I LIKE THE ONES WHO STRUGGLE.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.942
NO, NO, NO.

29:05.377 --> 29:09.415
I LIKE IT ROUGH.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.483
YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
YOU FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.086

29:43.449 --> 29:46.485
- OKAY. NO PROBLEM, MA'AM.
NO PROBLEM.

29:46.518 --> 29:47.920
LOWER THE GUN.
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.922
NOBODY NEEDS TO GET HURT HERE.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.259
[grunts]

29:53.292 --> 29:54.827
- HANDS IN THE AIR.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.362
- THIS ONE'S DONE.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.397

30:00.132 --> 30:01.500
COME HERE.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.003
HEY, YOU'RE OKAY NOW.
ALL RIGHT?

30:13.112 --> 30:13.312
.

30:13.345 --> 30:13.779
- CARMEN HAD A DATE.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.283
WE GAVE HER A RIDE,
FIVE MINUTES LATER

30:17.316 --> 30:18.951
SHE CALLED, SCREAMING,
SCARED FOR HER LIFE.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.186
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.954
- YOU THINK THAT'S GONNA
PLAY FOR A JURY?

30:21.988 --> 30:22.621
WE'VE GOT YOU
AND YOUR MUSCLE ON VIDEO.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.290
- SELENA, STOP.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.292
WE'VE BEEN TRACKING YOU.
WE HAVE YOU,

30:26.325 --> 30:29.161
ON COMPELLING PROSTITUTION.
THAT'S TEN YEARS, MINIMUM.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.263
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
TEN YEARS.

30:31.297 --> 30:34.967
SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION.

30:35.001 --> 30:39.205
- [scoffs]
SO YOU'RE HER MOUTHPIECE?

30:39.238 --> 30:41.607
NICE SUIT.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.076
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO'S PAYING YOUR SALARY,

30:44.110 --> 30:46.245
BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY HERE
TO DEFEND SELENA,

30:46.278 --> 30:50.082
THEN I SUGGEST YOU GET HER
TO TELL US SOMETHING.

30:50.116 --> 30:53.552
- I DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING.
- SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.487
WE KNOW SHE'S WORKED HER WAY
TO THE BOTTOM.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.890
WE'RE BUILDING
A CASE AGAINST HER BOSS.

30:57.924 --> 31:00.659
- HOW, BY THREATENING MY CLIENT
WITH JAIL?

31:00.692 --> 31:03.262
WITH DEPORTATION?

31:03.295 --> 31:05.531
I WOULD THINK SVU DETECTIVES
WOULD HAVE MORE SYMPATHY

31:05.564 --> 31:07.967
FOR THE PATH
SHE'S BEEN MADE TO WALK.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.970
- FAIR ENOUGH.
LET'S TALK ABOUT HER PATH.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.205
LET'S TALK ABOUT
HOW SHE GOT HERE.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.175
LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHO SHE WORKS FOR,

31:16.208 --> 31:19.278
AND WHAT HE MADE HER DO.

31:21.247 --> 31:25.317
- WHAT YOU ARE ASKING HER TO DO
WOULD PUT HER IN GRAVE DANGER.

31:25.351 --> 31:28.687
TO PROTECT HERSELF, MY CLIENT
IS INVOKING AT THIS POINT.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.158
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO
CONSULT WITH YOUR CLIENT FIRST?

31:32.191 --> 31:35.294
MAYBE SEE WHAT SHE WANTS?
- DON'T TRY TO TRICK HER.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.497
SELENA KNOWS
TO TRUST HER ABOGADO.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.967
VERDAD, SELENA?

31:46.638 --> 31:50.342
[door opens, closes]

31:50.376 --> 31:52.511
- YOU SAW THE LOOK OF TERROR
ON HER FACE

31:52.544 --> 31:54.313
WHEN HER OWN LAWYER
WALKED IN THE ROOM?

31:54.346 --> 31:57.049
SHE'S SCARED TO DEATH.
- SHE WORKS FOR THOSE PIMPS.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.251
SHE HAD TO KNOW ABOUT ELLIE,
SHE HAD TO KNOW

31:59.285 --> 32:01.187
ABOUT THAT 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
MISSY.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.490
- AND GOING AFTER NOAH?
- YES.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.326
- WHATEVER SHE'S BECOME,
WE KNOW SHE STARTED OUT

32:07.359 --> 32:10.129
LIKE THOSE OTHER GIRLS.
- THAT'S WHO SHE WAS.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.299
IT'S NOT WHO SHE IS NOW.
SHE'S A VICTIMIZER NOW.

32:13.332 --> 32:16.568
WE HAVE TO
BUILD A CASE AGAINST HER.

32:16.602 --> 32:19.671
WHERE'S LUNA?
- SHE'S IN THE BUNK ROOM.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.074
- GET HER DOWN HERE.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.612
- HOW'S MY APPLICATION
FOR "T" STATUS GOING?

32:30.316 --> 32:32.318
- I'M WORKING ON IT.

32:34.086 --> 32:38.224
LUNA, DO YOU KNOW HER?

32:38.257 --> 32:42.128
- EVERYBODY KNOWS SELENA.
SHE'S IN CHARGE OF US.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.596
- SO SHE'S THE ENFORCER?
- YES.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.266
BUT NOW SHE THINKS SHE'S BETTER
BECAUSE SHE WORKS FOR THEM.

32:47.299 --> 32:51.270
SHE USED TO BE LIKE US.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.140
SHE TELLS ME IT'S MY FAULT
I'M A WHORE.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.108
- YOUR FAULT?

32:59.345 --> 33:02.248
- SHE ASKS HOW COULD
I BE SO STUPID.

33:02.281 --> 33:06.685
IN OUR VILLAGE, VARGAS,
EVERY GIRL KNEW IT COULD HAPPEN.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.225
AND I DID WHAT MY MOTHER SAID.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.726
I NEVER WORE MAKEUP.

33:14.760 --> 33:18.230
I TRIED TO LOOK UGLY,
NO DRESSES.

33:18.264 --> 33:21.233
[speaks Spanish]

33:21.267 --> 33:23.602
AND WHEN THE NARCOS COME,
YOU HIDE.

33:27.806 --> 33:31.043
- IT'S OKAY.

33:31.077 --> 33:34.680
- ONE DAY, I WAS HIDING WITH MY
KITTEN WHEN SHE RAN AWAY.

33:37.649 --> 33:41.387
I CLIMBED OUT AFTER HER,
AND THEY TOOK ME.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.325
JUST AFTER MY FIRST COMMUNION.

33:46.358 --> 33:50.829
- LUNA, WHY DID YOU SAY

33:50.862 --> 33:54.266
"OUR VILLAGE?"

33:54.300 --> 33:57.403
- SELENA WAS ONE
OF THE FIRST GIRLS TAKEN.

33:57.436 --> 34:01.107
EVERYBODY KNEW HER STORY.

34:01.140 --> 34:05.344
SHE WAS AT THE MARKET ONE DAY
WITH HER MOTHER,

34:05.377 --> 34:08.280
AND SHE LET GO
OF HER MAMA'S HAND.

34:08.314 --> 34:12.284
AND THAT WAS IT.

34:12.318 --> 34:17.156
AND EVERYBODY KNEW
SHE GOT TAKEN TO TENANCINGO.

34:17.189 --> 34:19.825
SAME PLACE I GOT TAKEN.

34:23.795 --> 34:27.466
- TENANCINGO IS THE EPICENTER
FOR SEX TRAFFICKING IN MEXICO.

34:27.499 --> 34:30.569
PIMPING IS
THEIR MAIN INDUSTRY.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.472
IT IS A VERY POOR VILLAGE,
SHACK AFTER SHACK AFTER SHACK.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.307
EXCEPT FOR THESE MANSIONS.

34:35.341 --> 34:38.544
THEY'RE FIVE STORIES HIGH,
TURRETED, GATES.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.179
PAGODA ROOFTOPS.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.281
- I SPOKE TO A FEDERAL TASK
FORCE LOOKING INTO THIS.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.283
THE TRAFFICKERS
MAKE SO MUCH MONEY,

34:44.316 --> 34:45.884
THEY BUILD THESE HUGE HOUSES.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.287
THEIR MOTHERS LIVE THERE,
A FEW GUARDS, AND THE CHILDREN.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.721
- CHILDREN
OF KIDNAPPED GIRLS.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.490
- SO THERE HAVE MANSIONS
IN MEXICO.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.659
HOW'S THIS HELP US
TAKE DOWN THIS CREW?

34:53.692 --> 34:55.227
- I'M JUST GETTING TO THAT.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.229
THE TASK FORCE WAS ABLE
TO ID THREE OWNERS.

34:57.263 --> 35:00.366
THE FIRST, SHOT TO DEATH
IN TIJUANA LAST APRIL.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.534
THE SECOND IS A RELATIVE
OF A RESPECTED MEMBER

35:02.568 --> 35:05.404
OF THE TOWN COUNCIL.
AND THE THIRD THEY CLAIM

35:05.437 --> 35:08.240
IS SOMEWHERE IN THE U.S.,
POSSIBLY NEW YORK.

35:08.274 --> 35:11.377
TEODORO JUAREZ, 35.
- SON OF A BITCH.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.581
- AM I MISSING SOMETHING?
- THAT'S ANGEL.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.649
MUST HAVE VANDALIZED
HIS OWN OFFICE.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.585
- TEODORO JUAREZ IS KNOWN
TO US AS ANGEL PEREZ.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.920
HE OWNS QUICKRIDE,
THE CAR SERVICE THE GIRLS USE.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.590
- SO HE WASN'T JUST
TRANSPORTING, HE'S TRAFFICKING.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.226
- PROBLEM IS, NO ONE'S
GONNA TESTIFY TO THAT.

35:27.259 --> 35:29.495
HE'S RUTHLESS,
HE DOESN'T THINK TWICE

35:29.528 --> 35:31.663
ABOUT KIDNAPPING YOUNG GIRLS,
RAPING THEM,

35:31.697 --> 35:33.232
AND HOLDING THEIR
BABIES HOSTAGE.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.733
- HOLD ON.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.369
THAT MIGHT BE OUR WAY IN.

35:37.403 --> 35:39.938
THESE GIRLS,
THEY'VE GIVEN UP ON THEMSELVES.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.774
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BABIES?

35:42.808 --> 35:44.710
DOES THE TASK FORCE
HAVE EYES ON THE GROUND?

35:44.743 --> 35:47.279
- AND IN THE AIR.
- SO CAN THEY TELL US

35:47.313 --> 35:49.748
HOW MANY KIDS ARE HIDDEN
INSIDE ANGEL'S MOTHER'S HOUSE.

35:58.257 --> 35:58.457
.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.358
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?
I'VE DONE MY TWO DAYS.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.494
I'M OUT TOMORROW.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

36:02.528 --> 36:05.197
- YOU THINK YOUR LAWYER
GOT YOU THAT DEAL?

36:05.231 --> 36:07.333
WE HAD YOU ON TRAFFICKING,
ASSAULT, RAPE.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.268
LETTING YOU PLEA DOWN
TO A MIS-D,

36:09.301 --> 36:10.902
THAT WAS JUST TO GET
YOUR LAWYER OUT OF THE WAY.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.738
- MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HIM,
TELL HIM YOU'RE HERE.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.306
- YOU COULD DO THAT.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.741
I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA

36:15.774 --> 36:17.309
HELP YOU GET YOUR SON BACK.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.615
- MIGUEL?

36:23.649 --> 36:26.318
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

36:26.352 --> 36:29.255
IS HE OKAY?
- HE'S FINE.

36:29.288 --> 36:32.824
U.S. FEDERAL AGENTS
TOOK THAT PHOTO YESTERDAY.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.893
IN TENANCINGO.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.429
IN ANGEL'S HOUSE.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.802
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

36:43.835 --> 36:47.739
YOU WANT ME TO TALK?

36:47.773 --> 36:49.975
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?
THEY'RE GONNA KILL HIM.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.411
- WE'VE GOT A TASK FORCE
ON THE GROUND, OKAY.

36:52.444 --> 36:56.815
WE THINK WE CAN GET MIGUEL BACK
FROM MEXICO AND BACK TO YOU.

36:56.848 --> 37:00.452
- IS THIS A TRICK?
- NO, IT'S NOT A TRICK.

37:00.486 --> 37:03.789
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO SEE YOUR SON AGAIN,

37:03.822 --> 37:05.691
YOU NEED TO TURN ON ANGEL.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.793
YOU NEED TO TESTIFY.

37:07.826 --> 37:12.764
AND THIS LIFE THAT YOU'VE LED,
SELENA, IS OVER.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.271
- [sniffles]

37:19.305 --> 37:20.939
MIGUEL.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.378
WHERE DO I START?

37:28.514 --> 37:30.282
- YOU START WITH HER.

37:37.756 --> 37:41.360
- ELLIE.

37:41.393 --> 37:44.863
SHE WAS SMART.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.667
HAD SPIRIT.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.870
THAT'S ALWAYS TROUBLE.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.706
ANGEL GAVE PERMISSION FOR
ANYBODY TO DO WHATEVER

37:54.740 --> 37:57.376
THEY WANTED TO HER.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.847
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO ME...

38:04.082 --> 38:06.051
IF I HELP YOU?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.557
- YOU'RE GONNA TRANSFER ME
TO MICHIGAN, RIGHT?

38:11.590 --> 38:13.425
I READ ONLINE
THAT'S THE PLACE TO GO.

38:13.459 --> 38:16.995
- JUST SIGN THE STATEMENT, TINO,
BEFORE I TAKE IT AWAY.

38:26.104 --> 38:28.840
- WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR,
A FAVOR?

38:28.874 --> 38:31.042
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

38:31.076 --> 38:33.779
'CAUSE I'M TELLING ANYONE WHO'LL
LISTEN YOU TOOK A BRIBE.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.947
- UC'S CALL THAT EVIDENCE.

38:35.981 --> 38:40.886
I'M NOT AS DIRTY AS I SEEM,
JOAQUIN.

38:40.919 --> 38:45.491
I'M HERE WITH BAD NEWS.
EVERYONE'S CUTTING DEALS.

38:45.524 --> 38:48.093
THEY'RE LINING UP
TO TURN ON ANGEL.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.570
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

38:58.604 --> 39:00.839
- WELL,
I'M AFRAID IT'S TOO LATE.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.140
THEY DON'T NEED YOU.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.976
YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIFE
WITHOUT PAROLE.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.778
- THIS AIN'T OVER, AMARO.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.118
- SIGNED STATEMENTS
FROM LITTLE TINO,

39:13.151 --> 39:15.454
FIVE TRAFFICKED GIRLS,
AND SELENA.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.055
- EVERYONE HATES GUYS
LIKE ANGEL.

39:17.088 --> 39:21.059
WHEN IT TURNS, IT TURNS FAST.
LET'S GET HIM.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.128
- YEAH, WE'RE RUNNING
A LITTLE BIT LATE.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.963
- POLICE! DON'T MOVE.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.965
- YOU! HEY! PUT YOUR HANDS UP!
PUT 'EM ON THAT CAR!

39:26.998 --> 39:28.967
- SECURE THE HOUSE!
GO AROUND BACK!

39:29.000 --> 39:30.936
- WHAT IS THIS? I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.439
- WE HAVE A WARRANT. KEEP YOUR
HANDS UP WHERE WE CAN SEE 'EM.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.106
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
HE'S DONE NOTHING WRONG!

39:35.140 --> 39:37.008
- DON'T MAKE THIS HARD.
- IT'S OVER, ANGEL.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.511
WE ARRESTED YOUR MOTHER
IN TENANCINGO FOR KIDNAPPING.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.747
- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN
SILENT. ANYTHING YOU SAY

39:41.780 --> 39:43.482
CAN AND
WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.417
- MIRA, CALL THE LAWYERS.
- I WILL.

39:45.451 --> 39:48.520
- YOU KNOW THIS IS STUPID,
RIGHT? I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

39:48.554 --> 39:51.457
I KNOW ABOUT THAT BABY.
FROM ONE PARENT TO ANOTHER,

39:51.490 --> 39:53.091
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.126
- YOU THREATENING
MY SERGEANT'S KID?

39:55.160 --> 39:57.028
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING!

39:57.062 --> 39:58.730
- MA'AM!
- GET BACK!

39:58.764 --> 40:00.198
- UNH!
- ANGEL!

40:00.231 --> 40:02.568
- AAH!

40:02.601 --> 40:05.737
- NO! AAH!

40:05.771 --> 40:08.607
WHY? ANGEL!
- PLEASE STEP AWAY.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.776
- OH, NO, NO! ANGEL!

40:10.809 --> 40:13.078
- LET'S GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

40:13.111 --> 40:16.181
- ANGEL! NO, NO!
[sobbing]

40:21.252 --> 40:23.455
[security door buzzes]

40:37.936 --> 40:40.105
- MIJO!
- MAMA!

40:40.138 --> 40:42.874
- MIJO! OH!

40:42.908 --> 40:45.911
[both crying]

41:07.566 --> 41:11.537
- HI, NOAH. HOW'S MY BOY?

41:11.570 --> 41:14.205
MWAH.
HUH, HOW'S MY BABY?

41:16.074 --> 41:19.911
I GOT GOOD NEWS,
SWEETHEART.

41:19.945 --> 41:23.248
THE MAN THAT HURT YOUR MAMA
IS NEVER...

41:23.281 --> 41:27.052
EVER GONNA HURT ANYBODY AGAIN.

41:27.085 --> 41:28.987
IT'S OVER.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.057
IT'S OKAY NOW.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.131
I LOVE YOU.
