(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:35.769 --> 00:37.736
(WHIMPERS)

00:39.239 --> 00:41.640
Well, mystery solved.
Let's go team.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.075
(SIRENS APPROACHING)

00:45.779 --> 00:48.614
So, the sound they heard
coming from their attic

00:48.616 --> 00:50.082
really was a demon, huh?

00:50.084 --> 00:52.251
MIKE: Yep, I think it was.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.219
I definitely think
that it was.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.121
And so you thought
you should just, uh,

00:56.123 --> 00:57.723
burn their house
to the ground?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.626
Yeah, that seemed like
the thing to do, you know,

01:00.628 --> 01:01.927
to get the demon.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.963
PIGEON: Yeah, I mean, yeah,
if there was a demon.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.132
MIKE: Yeah, it was definitely
a demon in there.

01:07.134 --> 01:08.700
I'm pretty sure of that.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.840
That poor old couple.

01:14.842 --> 01:18.010
You could've at least offered
to take them to a hotel
or something.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.345
PIGEON:
Way to go, guys. Great job.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.649
-You were a big help.
-What?

01:23.651 --> 01:26.051
I thought you said,
"Stay inside the van."

01:26.053 --> 01:28.053
You didn't say,
"Stay inside the van,"

01:28.055 --> 01:29.755
you said,
"Stay inside the van."

01:29.757 --> 01:31.423
But, you know, we got this,

01:31.425 --> 01:34.026
don't worry about it,
that kind of thing.

01:34.028 --> 01:35.527
-No.
-That is so weird.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.996
I remember I was about
to get out and go in there,

01:37.998 --> 01:39.398
participate in that mystery,

01:39.400 --> 01:41.567
and then I could swear
you said,

01:41.569 --> 01:43.268
"Pigeon, why don't
you hang out in the van?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.471
"And we'll go in this house,
see what's going on,

01:45.473 --> 01:47.639
"and we'll call you
if we need anything."

01:47.641 --> 01:50.442
You're saying that
you didn't say any of that.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.444
You know I didn't say
any of that.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.580
Hey, everybody, do you know
what mystery that was?

01:54.582 --> 01:56.415
That was
our hundredth mystery.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.184
-What?
-We have not solved
a hundred mysteries.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.686
Not solved but attempted.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.488
This is cause
for a celebration.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.323
Hey, let's go to Remaldos.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.525
-Oh, please. No. No.
-Oh, not Remaldos.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.760
Wait, is that
the Mexican restaurant

02:08.762 --> 02:11.697
where all the waiters
are white college kids?

02:11.699 --> 02:12.931
It's always a good sign,

02:12.933 --> 02:15.134
when you're gonna sit down
to some Mexican food

02:15.136 --> 02:18.137
and the person taking your
order keeps asking if you want

02:18.139 --> 02:20.639
an order of "guaca-mole"
for the table.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.675
You know it, Pigeon, they got
that good guaca-mole there.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.513
Can I get anyone
anything to drink?

02:27.515 --> 02:30.082
-Iced tea for me.
-Me too, iced tea.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.717
I thought we were celebrating.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.219
Lucky diamond light
and a tequila shot
on the side.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.488
-Any tequila?
-Any tequila.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.390
-And you, sir?
-Do you have iced tea?

02:38.392 --> 02:39.858
Yes, lemon with that?

02:39.860 --> 02:41.160
Hmm.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.228
Hey, Pigeon, did you get
any lemon with yours?

02:43.230 --> 02:45.197
-No.
-No lemon please.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.732
I'll send over some chips
and guaca-mole.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.501
Oh, good, because this
is a celebration.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.871
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

02:52.873 --> 02:54.640
You're welcome.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.309
Um, before we eat,
I'd like to say grace.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.245
For this and all
we're about to receive,

03:00.247 --> 03:02.147
make us truly grateful, Lord.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.316
Through Christ we pray, amen.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.988
-What the...was that?
-What?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.523
It's called giving thanks.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.359
When did you become, um,
religious?

03:14.361 --> 03:16.361
I go to Bible study
once a week.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.799
You all said I needed to make
friends my own age.

03:20.801 --> 03:21.800
So you joined a cult?

03:21.802 --> 03:24.069
Okay, before being
so critical,

03:24.071 --> 03:26.605
why don't we let Yung tell us
a little more about it.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.674
What church is the group
identified with?

03:29.609 --> 03:30.676
Christian.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.244
Well, what the hell
does that mean?

03:32.246 --> 03:33.545
Is it Protestant, Episcopal,
Methodist?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.447
I don't know,
it's just Christian.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.282
Look, we just hang out mostly.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.785
You guys are acting like
I joined a gang.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.154
Okay, I'm gonna wash my hands
and I hope when I get back,

03:42.156 --> 03:44.590
you're all done
being so judgmental.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.960
Mmm, this is a dangerous
moment in parenting.

03:47.962 --> 03:49.828
I know that you have to let
your children

03:49.830 --> 03:52.364
experiment with stuff
when they grow older

03:52.366 --> 03:54.333
and trust them
that they'll find their way,

03:54.335 --> 03:56.168
but I thought
it would be drugs or sexting

03:56.170 --> 03:57.469
or something normal.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.705
I mean, man, she's Asian, man.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.907
So I thought
maybe I'm gambling,

04:01.909 --> 04:03.375
but not Jesus.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.644
I didn't see Jesus
coming in our lives.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.312
Here's your tequila and beer,

04:07.314 --> 04:09.281
and iced tea
for everyone else.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.482
I didn't order ice-tea.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.317
-No?
-I said root beer.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.919
But I think I'm gonna
change it.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.520
Give me a hot chocolate.

04:20.994 --> 04:24.596
Ooh, that kale
is a bitter mother...
Tastes like garbage.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.398
Hey, Pigeon,
you want me to make you

04:26.400 --> 04:27.966
a kale protein shake?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.568
Oh, no, thank you.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.804
On account of you just said
it tastes like garbage.

04:32.806 --> 04:33.872
(DOORBELL RINGS)

04:35.241 --> 04:37.209
Hey, everyone,
that's my friend, Will.

04:37.211 --> 04:39.344
-Who's Will?
-He's in my Bible study.

04:39.346 --> 04:40.979
-He's coming over to hang out.
-Hang out?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.115
When I was your age,
hangout meant anal.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.249
-What?
-Wait,

04:44.251 --> 04:45.617
maybe it didn't mean that,

04:45.619 --> 04:48.053
but it definitely meant
you liked him.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.122
-Do you like this Will?
-I do.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.957
So don't embarrass me, Pigeon.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.325
Embarrass you, how?

04:53.327 --> 04:54.693
Like, by talking,

04:54.695 --> 04:56.361
or by watching pornography
in front of him

04:56.363 --> 04:58.630
and masturbating to it
in front of him.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.232
Or by asking to see his penis,

05:00.234 --> 05:02.801
or by telling him that I have
a penis, stuff like that.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.438
That embarrasses you?
You're so fragile.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.640
I guess it makes sense
that you need religion.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.410
You're gonna be such
a frail reed.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.648
Gosh, I can't believe that
your dad is Mike Tyson.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.917
I mean,
that's incredibly interesting.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.986
I mean, nothing about you
seemed to suggest

05:20.988 --> 05:22.487
that he was your dad.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.856
(SIGHS)
Yeah, I get that a lot.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.792
Yung, can I...

05:28.194 --> 05:29.528
-Whoa.
-Oh.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.963
No, I meant to talk to you.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.299
Physical intimacy
outside of marriage

05:34.301 --> 05:36.501
is an abomination before God.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.805
Oh, yeah, no, totally, you,

05:39.807 --> 05:41.406
you had an eyelash
on your cheek,

05:41.408 --> 05:42.641
so I was gonna blow you.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.109
Actually, I wasn't
gonna blow you,

05:44.111 --> 05:45.410
I was gonna, with my mouth,

05:45.412 --> 05:47.112
I wasn't gonna blow wind,

05:47.114 --> 05:49.681
I wasn't gonna suck it off.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.752
Yung, do you know
what the rapture is?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.954
Um, sort of.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.557
It's when those who are saved
will be taken up to heaven,

05:58.559 --> 06:00.425
while the rest
will be left behind on Earth

06:00.427 --> 06:02.627
to be tortured
by Satan's minions.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.197
Wow.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.599
We haven't talked about that
at bible study, have we?

06:07.601 --> 06:08.900
I hate to say it,

06:08.902 --> 06:11.036
but not everybody
goes to bible study

06:11.038 --> 06:12.637
for the right reasons.

06:12.639 --> 06:15.774
I think some people just like
to hang out with friends.

06:15.776 --> 06:19.077
And do charitable stuff
for those less fortunate.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.246
(SCOFFS) What assholes.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.549
Yung, I need you to be saved,
so when the rapture comes

06:24.551 --> 06:26.952
you can join me
in the kingdom of heaven.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.220
Well, that's nice.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.155
Of course, you'll be
leaving behind your friends.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.690
-What?
-Well...

06:31.692 --> 06:34.025
That all-white man
you introduced me to

06:34.027 --> 06:35.527
is obviously a homosexual.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.362
Which is an abomination
before God.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.597
-I don't...
-And someone trained

06:38.599 --> 06:40.732
your pet bird,
to say the C-word.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.335
He told me I have
a C-word face.

06:43.337 --> 06:44.736
Well, I'm sorry he said that.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.305
You definitely do not have
a...face.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.274
But Will, I have to say,

06:49.276 --> 06:52.144
I'm sorry, but I don't believe
any of this stuff.

06:52.146 --> 06:53.712
That's what faith is.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.481
Believing in things that are
unbelievable and crazy?

06:56.483 --> 06:57.949
-Yeah.
-Okay.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.951
Everybody, we got
a new mystery!

06:59.953 --> 07:01.920
Dad, have you been
hiding in there?

07:01.922 --> 07:04.990
I came out because I saw
we got a new mystery.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.458
Then, you guys came out.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.627
And then I wanted to
respect your privacy.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.762
So I just crouched down
in there

07:10.764 --> 07:12.631
and I hid, and I spied on you.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.633
So, yes. Then I just
wanted to make sure

07:14.635 --> 07:16.635
that Will wasn't
a scientologist.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.702
He seemed so nice.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.538
And every scientologist
I've met

07:19.540 --> 07:21.006
has always been so nice.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.375
And you're just like,
"No one can be that nice."

07:23.377 --> 07:25.377
-It's just weird.
-Oh, my God.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.179
What's...face
still doing here?

07:27.181 --> 07:29.948
Will, I have to go.
We have a mystery to solve.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.351
Yung, please, I'm not leaving
here until you're saved.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.053
It could happen at any second.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.122
What could happen
at any second?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.423
The rapture.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.858
Unfortunately, you won't
be joining us

07:39.860 --> 07:41.460
in the kingdom of heaven,
because you're gay.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.094
You'll be going to hell.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.263
Okay, I'll be sure to say hi
to your mom when I get there.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.398
...face.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.833
To the Mystery Mobile.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.103
I'll wait here for you!

07:57.477 --> 07:59.544
It's that same
old couple again.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.346
What the hell do they want?

08:01.348 --> 08:05.617
I bet they want to sue you
for burning down
their...house.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.353
OLD MAN: Oh, finally.

08:08.355 --> 08:09.955
Margaret and I
were sitting here,

08:09.957 --> 08:13.458
picking through the ashes,
looking at everything we had,

08:13.460 --> 08:14.826
all burned to nothing,

08:14.828 --> 08:17.529
when suddenly
that demon popped up.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.664
Ha! I told you there was
a demon, Pigeon.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.899
He didn't believe me.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.567
No, it was more like
I didn't care.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.702
So, what happened?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.203
He said, "Take my hand."

08:25.205 --> 08:28.707
And we said, "No, sir.
Get on out of here, demon."

08:28.709 --> 08:31.309
-And he did.
-Well, that was nice of him.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.978
But before he went, he said

08:32.980 --> 08:34.880
since you burned down
this house,

08:34.882 --> 08:36.748
he was going to go live
in your house,

08:36.750 --> 08:40.285
and get one of you to let him
live in your soul.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.053
Oh, no, Will.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.522
Who the...is Will?

08:45.758 --> 08:48.260
How long does it take
to solve a mystery?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.297
Ah, finally.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.736
Yung, is that you?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.938
(MENACING LAUGHTER)

08:59.940 --> 09:02.240
DEMON: I'm not Yung, you fool.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.544
I'm here to steal your soul.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.945
WILL: You can't have me,
demon.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.514
My God is an awesome God.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.550
He's an awesome God!

09:18.624 --> 09:19.791
Will!

09:19.793 --> 09:23.261
Will is gone. I took his soul.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.730
I'm the demon Bathog.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.234
Come forth and admire
my nine penises.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.702
(LAUGHS)

09:32.872 --> 09:35.340
Well, don't just
stand there, Yung.

09:41.113 --> 09:42.647
Hello, everybody.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.816
God, here.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.185
Will was right,
it's the rapture.

09:47.187 --> 09:51.189
Oh, no, son, there's no such
thing as the rapture.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.792
That was something we told
some of the dumber ones

09:53.794 --> 09:55.226
to keep them in line.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.862
But we need to take care of
that demon Bathog,

09:57.864 --> 10:01.299
and there is only one way
to take care of a demon.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.934
Am I right, Mike Tyson?

10:02.936 --> 10:06.237
Hell yeah, God, burn that
mother...down.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.646
I'm sorry,
but believe me, Yung,

10:14.648 --> 10:15.947
it would not
have been enjoyable

10:15.949 --> 10:18.950
losing your virginity
to a nine-dicked demon.

10:20.052 --> 10:21.219
Well...

10:21.221 --> 10:22.554
God bless y'all.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.289
Ha! Go Cowboys!

10:24.291 --> 10:25.724
(LAUGHS)

10:28.694 --> 10:31.296
PIGEON:
Ha! God is Jerry Jones.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.807
I was informed that is was
just our 30th mystery, yes,

10:42.809 --> 10:45.710
um, bad counting.
I was doing the counting,

10:45.712 --> 10:47.912
of course it came out bad,
and, um,

10:47.914 --> 10:50.448
we're only on number 30.
Three-oh.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.650
Thank you.
