00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on?

00:09.000 --> 00:10.633
Hey, stop right there,
sir.

00:10.633 --> 00:11.667
Let me see some ID.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.667
ID? I'm George Lopez.
I live here.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.067
ID, sir.

00:16.067 --> 00:17.400
Man, all right.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.700
You wanna go viral?
Film this.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.967
All right, Mr. Lopez,
your neighbors complained

00:21.967 --> 00:23.300
about reckless endangerment.

00:23.300 --> 00:26.200
Knives flying
into their backyards.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.367
I was just throwing them
at the fence.

00:28.367 --> 00:29.567
And one slipped through.

00:29.567 --> 00:31.767
Oh man, Hector,
come on, man.

00:31.767 --> 00:34.167
What're you thinking,
dude?

00:34.167 --> 00:37.167
(sighing)
Listen, he's staying with me.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.500
I'm trying to rehabilitate him,
help him out.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.100
Why don't I make a...
(clearing throat)

00:40.100 --> 00:42.100
a donation.
Is it still...

00:42.100 --> 00:43.667
Toys for Tots.
Toys for Tots.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.200
Thank you, Officer.
All right, thanks.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.100
**

00:48.200 --> 00:50.000
Unhook him.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
(siren whooping)

00:51.000 --> 00:53.133
**

00:55.800 --> 00:58.500
I simply don't get it.
I tweeted 32 great rants

00:58.500 --> 00:59.833
about e-cigarettes,
and I've got

00:59.833 --> 01:03.833
a total of 32 likes,
and they're all from Hector.

01:03.833 --> 01:05.567
Got your back, bro.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.267
Damn, I gotta
figure out a way

01:07.267 --> 01:08.567
for more people
to see my stuff.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.800
George, I need
some of your followers.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.367
Can you just retweet me
once every few hours?

01:13.367 --> 01:14.567
The people that follow me
don't like you.

01:14.567 --> 01:15.567
But I tell you what,
I'mma do it.

01:15.567 --> 01:16.900
'Cause you sound desperate.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.633
Hey, can't have a recap
of yesterday and be

01:18.633 --> 01:20.433
pissing the neighbors off,
so, Manolo,

01:20.433 --> 01:21.767
your job is to keep him
out of trouble.

01:21.767 --> 01:23.333
I'm sorry, jefe, but school's

01:23.333 --> 01:25.333
kicking me in the culo,
I gotta study.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.200
Can you quiz me
on the presidents?

01:27.200 --> 01:28.700
What makes you think
I know?

01:28.700 --> 01:32.400
Hey, Maronzio is gonna
quiz you on the presidents.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.067
And both of you help him
find a job

01:34.067 --> 01:36.767
because I can't have him here
exfoliating all day

01:36.767 --> 01:39.600
and taking cat naps between
episodes of the "Gilmore Girls."

01:39.600 --> 01:42.267
It's hard for parolees
to find even a doo-doo job.

01:42.267 --> 01:43.933
Like when I was trying
to get on at Arby's

01:43.933 --> 01:45.167
and they were like, "No."

01:45.167 --> 01:46.600
And I was like,
"Man..."

01:46.600 --> 01:48.600
You know who said that first?
Mark Twain.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.600
Write that down.
I'm going golfing.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.933
Help him find a job,
you two, all right?

01:53.933 --> 01:56.433
**

01:56.433 --> 01:59.300
Hey, Amir,
what zip code is that?

01:59.300 --> 02:00.700
Hey, you're pretty funny,
George.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.700
You ever think
of doing comedy?

02:02.700 --> 02:04.367
Hey, wait 'til you guys
see my new show.

02:04.367 --> 02:06.533
Hour-long drama...

02:06.533 --> 02:08.767
I play a scary
son of a bitch.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.933
Oh, you playing a drunk?
(all chuckling)

02:10.933 --> 02:12.433
Hey, I didn't know
your kid worked here.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.800
Yeah.
Mine did too.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.500
Hell, for the amount of money
we pay in dues,

02:15.500 --> 02:17.267
better hire our kids.

02:17.267 --> 02:20.167
That's right,
they better hire our kids.

02:20.167 --> 02:21.867
Hundred bucks you make
this one, Lopez.

02:21.867 --> 02:23.667
You're on.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.567
**

02:31.067 --> 02:34.367
It's actually so good
to be home actually.

02:34.367 --> 02:36.367
Glad you're back.
Again.

02:36.367 --> 02:38.100
It's like America's gotten

02:38.100 --> 02:40.600
so small-minded
and provincial.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.367
Seriously,
all the rad towns

02:42.367 --> 02:43.767
I used to live in
are dead.

02:43.767 --> 02:44.867
I had to dip out.

02:44.867 --> 02:46.333
I ghosted Williamsburg,

02:46.333 --> 02:48.667
I ghosted Brooklyn,
ghosted Omaha.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.067
So I was selling
chronic in Boulder

02:51.067 --> 02:52.500
until that became legal

02:52.500 --> 02:54.167
and then I was driving
for Lyft in Austin

02:54.167 --> 02:55.400
until that became illegal.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.567
Aww, they outlawed Lyft
and inlawed weed.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.933
An American tragedy.
You're so comedy.

03:00.933 --> 03:02.567
So I thought,
why not come home

03:02.567 --> 03:03.933
and let Mom enable me
for a while?

03:03.933 --> 03:06.133
Hey, it's kinda
like the old days.

03:06.133 --> 03:07.633
You at your computer
doing nerdy things

03:07.633 --> 03:09.433
and me actually
living my life.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.433
Hey, could you ghost
my room for just a sec?

03:11.433 --> 03:12.467
I've got a meeting
with George

03:12.467 --> 03:13.900
that I need to prepare for.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.433
Mmm, Mom said I should be
your new assistant.

03:17.433 --> 03:20.100
It's not the worst idea,
right?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.533
Mom?

03:25.100 --> 03:28.267
Wow, it's all
green and stuff.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.967
It's like we're in
nature or something.

03:29.967 --> 03:32.133
Hey, thanks for the
opportunity again, George.

03:32.133 --> 03:33.533
Okay, listen,
take it easy, all right?

03:33.533 --> 03:35.067
Bring it-bring it down
a little bit, all right?

03:35.067 --> 03:37.733
You're not a Lopez,
but here you represent me,

03:37.733 --> 03:39.533
George Lopez, okay?
Actually, George,

03:39.533 --> 03:41.967
I am a Lopez.
I'm Hector Lopez.

03:41.967 --> 03:44.633
You are?
Okay, well, listen.

03:44.633 --> 03:47.167
Probably let them know
you're not my kid, is one.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.267
But don't do
anything stupid

03:48.267 --> 03:49.400
or say anything stupid,
all right?

03:49.400 --> 03:50.633
And work,
but don't talk.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.500
Okay.
All right.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.500
Uh, what do I do with this?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.333
I got it.
You have money?

03:56.333 --> 03:57.933
Uh, yeah.
In your wallet.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.900
**

04:02.333 --> 04:03.533
Could you hurry up?

04:03.533 --> 04:05.600
I want to look good
on my first day.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.067
Who gives a rats?
It's only a trial.

04:08.067 --> 04:10.067
For you, this is just
something to pass the time

04:10.067 --> 04:13.300
'til you ghost off to Eugene
and open up a hula-hoop shop.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.467
Oregon? Gross.
Too white.

04:15.467 --> 04:17.067
Well, it doesn't matter
where you go.

04:17.067 --> 04:19.100
I'm only doing this for you
until you get on your feet

04:19.100 --> 04:20.500
and you leave again.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.433
This is my job
and I take it very seriously.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.567
You're really only doing this
because Mom threatened

04:24.567 --> 04:26.067
to kick you off
the family phone plan.

04:26.067 --> 04:27.867
It's my office,
so I need the--

04:27.867 --> 04:30.200
Okay, if you're gonna
be my assistant,

04:30.200 --> 04:32.067
I'm going to call you
Tagine.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.400
Your fake assistant?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.233
Can you do an accent?

04:36.233 --> 04:37.733
(Cockney accent)
G'day, mate!

04:37.733 --> 04:39.400
Could I get you
a cup of coffee?

04:39.400 --> 04:41.867
Maybe Coca-Cola?
A latte?

04:41.867 --> 04:44.700
Ow, was that Dothraki?
Forget it.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.867
I tried.
No, do your voice.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.967
So, uh...

04:48.967 --> 04:50.233
your Olly's sister?

04:50.233 --> 04:51.400
And assistant.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.400
I'm Pfeiffer.
Hi.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.400
Can I get you
a coffee, a water?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.367
They really need
a Stumptown around here.

04:57.367 --> 04:59.367
Uh, no, I'm okay.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.167
It's my house,
so I'm fine.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.667
(giggling)
This job is so epic.

05:03.667 --> 05:05.700
Um, should we start
the meeting?

05:07.867 --> 05:10.833
Pfeiffer, could you
excuse us for a sec?

05:10.833 --> 05:11.833
Whatever.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.200
(groaning)
Sorry, Mom
made me hire her.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.533
I work so hard
just to get by,

05:18.533 --> 05:20.733
and everything falls
into her lap.

05:20.733 --> 05:23.600
Jobs, dudes,
most nights.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.167
Okay.
Sorry.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.767
Yeah, back to business.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.600
Everything's moving along
very well with "The Valleys."

05:28.600 --> 05:30.233
They love Coco,
obviously.

05:30.233 --> 05:31.600
They're talking
to writers.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.300
In the meantime,
I'm going to scout

05:33.300 --> 05:35.067
a YouTube show
this weekend.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.300
I think you should come.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.667
Why?
That's horrible.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.133
Mmm, no doubt it will be.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.667
But these performers
have millions of followers.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.900
You could end up on one of
their live feeds and...

05:44.900 --> 05:48.100
And be relevant.
All right, I'll go.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.567
(clearing throat)

05:49.567 --> 05:51.400
Got Hector a job
at the country club.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.400
Trying to see
if everything's all right.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.700
He told me he'd text me.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.067
How did you and I end up
taking care of people?

05:57.067 --> 05:59.067
It's not like we're
these selfless altruists.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.867
We're in show business,
for God's sake.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.967
Maybe it's who we are.
Yeah.

06:02.967 --> 06:05.700
Wait, do you think you always
have to take care of me?

06:05.700 --> 06:07.800
Why, do you think you always
have to take care of me?

06:10.067 --> 06:12.067
**

06:19.067 --> 06:21.167
Ooh.

06:21.167 --> 06:23.200
Yo, hold up.
These are all for you?

06:23.200 --> 06:25.567
(exhaling)
I'm still drunk
from last night.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.567
Why stop now?
Woo-woo!

06:27.567 --> 06:29.167
Hey, block me
while I pound these.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.900
Well, hurry up, I don't
want to get in trouble, man.

06:33.233 --> 06:34.567
(exhaling)
Trouble?

06:34.567 --> 06:36.433
Aren't you the new barback
that was in lockup?

06:36.433 --> 06:38.600
Yeah, I'm Hector.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.600
Connor Hyundai,
no relation to the cars.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.933
But I am rich.
(playing siren sound effect)

06:42.933 --> 06:44.367
How'd you know
I was in jail?

06:44.367 --> 06:45.767
I found out everything.

06:45.767 --> 06:47.600
You were in jail
and still got a job here?

06:47.600 --> 06:49.067
That's thug.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.567
Well, look, man,
George Lopez is helping me out

06:50.567 --> 06:51.900
and I really don't want
to let him down.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.733
I hear you, esé.
My dad got me this gig.

06:53.733 --> 06:56.667
Did he give you that whole,
"fly straight, work hard,

06:56.667 --> 06:59.133
make connections" spiel?
Yeah.

06:59.133 --> 07:01.967
Well, you made the numero uno
conexión at this place.

07:01.967 --> 07:04.100
Nothing goes down without
me hearing about it, so...

07:04.100 --> 07:06.633
(phone vibrating)
Oh! Break time.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.067
You got any weed?
No!

07:08.067 --> 07:09.067
You want some?

07:10.533 --> 07:12.867
You sure this is okay?

07:12.867 --> 07:15.433
You know who I lit up with
in this very spot yesterday?

07:15.433 --> 07:17.267
The number-one realtor
in the Valley.

07:17.267 --> 07:19.633
He's gonna hire me to
DJ his Christmas party.

07:19.633 --> 07:20.933
Yeah...
That's a good connect.

07:20.933 --> 07:22.900
You bet your ass it is.
You stick with me,

07:22.900 --> 07:24.700
you're gonna be
crushing it too in no time.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.933
Country clubs are dope.

07:31.933 --> 07:34.133
Yo, sharing is caring, man.
Puff, puff, pass.

07:34.133 --> 07:35.267
Oh, yeah.

07:36.533 --> 07:38.300
**

07:42.367 --> 07:44.233
Who's this guy?

07:44.233 --> 07:45.400
Mmm, I told you.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.900
Hector. He's new.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.067
What's up?
I'm Bayleigh.

07:49.067 --> 07:52.067
She's lit, right, sis?
Sis?

07:52.067 --> 07:53.567
Oh, we say that
instead of "bro."

07:53.567 --> 07:55.567
It's more woke.
My girl's lit.

07:55.567 --> 07:56.733
Tell me she's lit.

07:56.733 --> 07:58.900
She's your girl, dude.
I mean, sis.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.633
It's okay, sis.
Say it.

08:00.633 --> 08:03.067
She's lit.
She's lit?

08:03.067 --> 08:05.133
Hells yeah!
(all laughing)

08:07.367 --> 08:09.067
Hey, what's your tattoo?

08:09.067 --> 08:11.433
Oh this? My whole squad
up in county has it.

08:11.433 --> 08:15.067
I inked it myself.
This dude is cool.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.667
Let's keep him.
Mm-hmm.

08:16.667 --> 08:17.833
Yeah?
Yeah.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.200
Yeah?

08:19.200 --> 08:20.467
Oh, okay.

08:23.533 --> 08:25.067
Hey!

08:25.067 --> 08:26.867
Where you been, dude?
You don't check your phone?

08:26.867 --> 08:28.867
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything is so great.

08:28.867 --> 08:30.700
I'm murdering it.
This kid named Connor

08:30.700 --> 08:31.867
is showing me all the ropes.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.700
Oh, his dad's
a bridge contractor.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.200
The secret is to build 'em
just good enough

08:35.200 --> 08:37.067
so you have to rebuild them
again in ten years.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.367
That's terrifying.

08:38.367 --> 08:40.733
(phone vibrating)
Oh, it's break time.

08:40.733 --> 08:41.967
Can't miss break time.
Connor said

08:41.967 --> 08:43.500
that's when
all the deals go down.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.567
Let me have that drink.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.967
Ho-ho! What's crackin',
hombre?

08:46.967 --> 08:48.167
You don't mind
if I sit, do you?

08:48.167 --> 08:49.233
I do, but go ahead.
That's cool.

08:49.233 --> 08:50.800
Thank you, pal.
Uh, listen,

08:50.800 --> 08:51.967
I'm working on
my new television show.

08:51.967 --> 08:53.167
It's kinda really relevant.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.300
Edgy, cooler,
younger audience.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.633
Ah, for Netflix?
Yeah, you know,
like that.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.300
Uh, here's the thing
you probably don't know

08:59.300 --> 09:00.833
about television shows,
it takes 'em

09:00.833 --> 09:02.167
a little while
to get up and running.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.300
The shows you do, sure.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.167
When I'm selling on
Great Value Network,

09:06.167 --> 09:08.867
I could do seven days a week
if I want.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.067
There's a constant
audience, buddy.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.500
Okay, listen.
I don't think you heard me

09:12.500 --> 09:14.967
where I said younger,
cooler audience.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.600
Au contraire, Georgie.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.933
Listen to me.

09:17.933 --> 09:21.100
Since "Shark Tank,"
everybody is into GVN.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.100
Young people, old people,
middle-aged people,

09:24.100 --> 09:26.600
hipsters, blipsters,
you name it, everybody.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.833
What's a blipster?

09:27.833 --> 09:29.467
Black hipsters.

09:29.467 --> 09:30.633
I'm writing that down.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.433
Wait a second.
Georgie...

09:32.433 --> 09:34.567
You should be selling
something, man.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.500
Yeah, but it's gotta be
really difficult to land on

09:36.500 --> 09:38.067
the right product,
though, right?

09:38.067 --> 09:39.167
All you do is come up
with something people

09:39.167 --> 09:40.600
think they're gonna
use all the time,

09:40.600 --> 09:41.833
but won't take up
too much space

09:41.833 --> 09:43.467
when they shove it
in their closet.

09:43.467 --> 09:45.367
Like the ThighMaster.
That thing,

09:45.367 --> 09:47.067
you could put that thing
in a glove compartment.

09:47.067 --> 09:49.067
Can fit anywhere.
Now you're talkin', baby.

09:49.067 --> 09:52.067
Huh?
You talk, I type.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.200
All right, let's see...

09:53.200 --> 09:55.867
Now this won't be
on the test,

09:55.867 --> 09:58.067
but I think
you need to know...

09:58.067 --> 10:01.867
that I am a direct descendent
of Thomas Jefferson.

10:01.867 --> 10:05.067
Mm-hmm. I have family
from that area.

10:05.067 --> 10:06.800
If you get a nickel,
you'll be able

10:06.800 --> 10:07.900
to see the resemblance.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.233
Hey--
Back off, homie.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.533
Sorry, uh, what kind
of perfume are you wearing?

10:12.533 --> 10:14.800
It's called chorizo,
no wonder you like it.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.600
Uh, Manolo, eyes on
your own paper

10:16.600 --> 10:18.900
and the notes are right here
on the board, baby.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.900
Sorry, Miss Wendy,
it's too far away.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.100
Wait a minute, man,
you need glasses

10:27.100 --> 10:29.600
and you've been driving me
this whole time?

10:29.600 --> 10:30.933
Hey, man,
what's wrong with you?

10:30.933 --> 10:32.600
Dude, you just ran
through that stop sign.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.733
Oh, I'm sorry, jefe.

10:34.733 --> 10:37.400
Jefe, I need some change
for the toll.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.433
Change for the toll?
We're under the bridge.

10:40.433 --> 10:41.900
Why are we waiting here?

10:41.900 --> 10:43.700
Stop sign.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.133
That's for a yard sale.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.933
Now it all makes sense.

10:47.933 --> 10:49.933
I'm making you
an eye doctor's appointment.

10:49.933 --> 10:52.100
And I'm driving us
to that YouTube showcase.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.700
Man, I love my new job.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.167
Thanks again so much.

10:56.167 --> 10:58.000
So everything went fine?
No problems?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.233
Yeah, man, no problems.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.533
Hey, do we have
any LaCroix left?

11:01.533 --> 11:03.200
Check the garage fridge.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.433
Garage fridge?
My life is badass.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.700
You're doing a good thing
for him, jefe.

11:09.700 --> 11:10.933
You know, Manolo?

11:10.933 --> 11:12.133
I wish there was
more people like me.

11:12.133 --> 11:13.300
I should take in more kids.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.433
I got four
empty rooms upstairs.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.967
(woman on TV)
So what'd you do last night?

11:18.967 --> 11:20.667
Did you end up going out
with that guy?

11:20.667 --> 11:22.467
(knocking on door)

11:25.467 --> 11:27.100
What's up?

11:27.100 --> 11:29.667
Uh, where's Connor?

11:29.667 --> 11:30.933
I don't know.

11:30.933 --> 11:32.133
How do you know
where I live?

11:32.133 --> 11:33.800
I followed you home.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.400
Then I waited
'til your two dads left.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.067
So you gonna let me in
or what?

11:38.067 --> 11:40.367
Uh, actually, um...

11:40.367 --> 11:43.067
I'm not supposed to have
anybody over.

11:48.167 --> 11:50.367
and I'm grabbing, like,
the cow's breasts, say what?

11:50.367 --> 11:51.867
(crowd laughing)
Udders?

11:51.867 --> 11:54.400
I mean, I don't remember
the technical term for them...

11:54.400 --> 11:56.067
Hey, Olly, so I've been
talking to Jake

11:56.067 --> 11:57.267
about getting
some products together

11:57.267 --> 11:59.200
to take over to GVN.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.733
Great, perfect.

12:00.733 --> 12:03.400
It's very important
to diversify these days.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.833
Yeah, just to clarify,

12:04.833 --> 12:06.533
is this guy purposely
trying not to be funny?

12:06.533 --> 12:08.300
Who knows, who cares?
You know what I mean?

12:08.300 --> 12:09.833
But you should try
to get on his feed.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.167
He's an engager.

12:11.167 --> 12:13.333
I'd engage with
that fine piece of ass.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.833
He has nine-million
followers.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.500
Nine-million followers?

12:16.500 --> 12:18.500
I gotta figure out a way
to get a piece of that.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.267
Ooh, if you get
one of your rants

12:20.267 --> 12:21.733
on one of these feeds...

12:21.733 --> 12:23.800
(imitating explosion blast)
(crowd laughing)

12:26.067 --> 12:27.400
How's it going
with Pfeiffer?

12:27.400 --> 12:28.867
Surprisingly, not awful.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.567
She's really great
with different brands

12:30.567 --> 12:32.167
of coconut water,
and she started

12:32.167 --> 12:34.067
an Instagram account
for my hats.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.167
How's Hector's job going?

12:35.167 --> 12:36.567
Surprisingly, not awful.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.300
You know, he's making
a lot of connections at work.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.767
You know what?
Go Team Lopez.

12:40.767 --> 12:43.100
(man)
Hey, give it up.
Paul Logan, everybody,

12:43.100 --> 12:46.300
with nine-million followers.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.500
(all cheering)

12:48.500 --> 12:50.333
Now this next guy
coming to the stage

12:50.333 --> 12:52.167
is a special guest with--

12:52.167 --> 12:53.600
How many followers
did you say you had?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.067
Uh, 3,033.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.633
(chuckling)

12:56.633 --> 12:59.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
Maronzio Vance.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.200
(scattered clapping)
'Kay. That's okay.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.667
Thank you for
that warm welcome.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.400
I don't wanna rant,
but I have to.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.667
Look, I saw a guy today
with a man bun.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.100
And I don't know
what that was about.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.567
But he had a man bun
and he had on

13:14.567 --> 13:17.067
a Pitbull: Live in Concert
T-shirt...

13:17.067 --> 13:18.567
(crowd chuckling)

13:18.567 --> 13:20.067
... and he
had on Crocs.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.400
Then on top of that,

13:21.400 --> 13:22.600
what made it
even more offensive

13:22.600 --> 13:24.600
is he was screaming
"I'm on it"

13:24.600 --> 13:26.433
into a flip phone.
(crowd laughing)

13:26.433 --> 13:28.733
Who still has a flip phone?
Can we just talk about

13:28.733 --> 13:31.900
how many ways this guy
is not "on it," people?

13:31.900 --> 13:34.700
Numero uno, no one should
wear a man bun

13:34.700 --> 13:37.067
unless you're
a samurai warrior...

13:37.067 --> 13:38.833
(all laughing)

13:38.833 --> 13:40.667
Is that our network
executive right there?

13:42.200 --> 13:43.433
Yes.
Jason.

13:43.433 --> 13:44.900
Not Jason.
I mean, Jason.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.600
But don't come over here.
No, that's cool.

13:46.600 --> 13:47.933
Actually, it's fine.
Play it cool.

13:47.933 --> 13:49.267
I'll follow your lead.

13:49.267 --> 13:50.433
Hi.
Oh, hey.

13:50.433 --> 13:52.433
Hi, hi, hi.
Hi.

13:52.433 --> 13:55.167
We'll talk after.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.367
My name is
Maronzio Vance.

13:56.367 --> 13:59.100
M-A-R-O-N-Z-I-O Vance.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.800
Thank y'all very much.
(crowd cheering)

14:05.600 --> 14:08.800
Yeah, Maronzio.
Yay, Maronzio!

14:08.800 --> 14:10.600
We know him.
(giggling)

14:10.600 --> 14:12.633
You drink too much
at these industry things.

14:12.633 --> 14:13.900
Mm-mmm, mmm.

14:13.900 --> 14:17.567
Alcoholism is the only
fun thing in our family.

14:17.567 --> 14:19.467
Where'd your sister go?
Huh?

14:21.067 --> 14:22.433
Of course.

14:22.433 --> 14:24.067
You know who else has
nine-million followers?

14:24.067 --> 14:26.200
Her, in her pants.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.167
Can I just take that?
Sure.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.467
Yeah, you'll be all right.

14:31.367 --> 14:33.233
So where we gonna do this?

14:33.233 --> 14:36.800
Wow, no offense,
but you're Connor's girlfriend.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.267
I told myself
if you didn't want

14:38.267 --> 14:40.100
to bump uglies,
I wouldn't force it.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.367
I'm not a perv, sis.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.067
Whew, thank goodness.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.367
So onto my second place.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.367
I want a prison tat.

14:47.367 --> 14:50.233
I brought the ink,

14:50.233 --> 14:52.400
clean knitting needle,

14:52.400 --> 14:54.167
at least I think
it's clean.

14:54.167 --> 14:56.633
I haven't done
a tattoo in forever.

14:56.633 --> 14:59.100
These will help.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.133
Shrooms?
Total ghetto.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.067
But it'll make it
all magical.

15:03.067 --> 15:05.067
Like The Beatles.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.700
A'ight.
Yeah.

15:08.067 --> 15:10.633
I crushed it, George.
Like, I crushed it.

15:10.633 --> 15:13.233
I feel good. I didn't even take
the eight bucks for the set.

15:13.233 --> 15:14.567
How much was it?
It was eight bucks.

15:14.567 --> 15:16.400
So you're rolling
in it, huh?

15:16.400 --> 15:18.067
Look, man,
I got new followers.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.800
I mean, the message and
the medium have finally met.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.633
Jefe, I saw
this big light,

15:22.633 --> 15:24.067
so I called Mami
to come down.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.367
Check out her new grill.

15:25.367 --> 15:27.067
What's that right there?
It smells delicious.

15:27.067 --> 15:28.433
I'll take two of those.

15:28.433 --> 15:31.200
Monies primero.
(George)
Seriously?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.600
That's why they're
building a wall.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.767
It's that kind of attitude.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.800
(rain falling)
Lluvia!

15:36.800 --> 15:38.100
(speaking Spanish)

15:38.100 --> 15:39.600
**

15:39.600 --> 15:41.267
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can't bring that in here.

15:41.267 --> 15:43.633
That's a fire hazard.
(whimpering)

15:43.633 --> 15:45.567
**

15:53.100 --> 15:54.533
What if somebody, like,

15:54.533 --> 15:56.800
invented an indoor
Mexican grill?

15:59.067 --> 16:02.567
(FaceTime ringing)
(woman on TV)
I just read a book
and cleaned my...

16:02.567 --> 16:04.767
Oh, Connor.
'Sup, Connor?

16:04.767 --> 16:07.767
Nah! Don't smile at me.
Where is she?

16:07.767 --> 16:10.133
She's gone, sis, chill.
What's up?

16:10.133 --> 16:13.067
Bayleigh texted a pic
of your hands on her ass.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.300
I have no chill.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.067
She wanted a tramp stamp,
all right?

16:16.067 --> 16:17.200
It goes above her ass.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.700
Wait, you didn't
like my work?

16:18.700 --> 16:22.067
Nobody puts angel wings
above my girl's ass.

16:22.067 --> 16:25.267
You think you're hard?
I'll show you hard.

16:25.267 --> 16:26.633
(FaceTime hanging up)

16:26.633 --> 16:27.600
Connor?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.300
(people chattering)

16:30.300 --> 16:32.633
Terrible.

16:32.633 --> 16:34.300
You guys didn't
hear anything?

16:34.300 --> 16:35.800
What the hell's going on?

16:35.800 --> 16:38.267
Well obviously,
I've been vandalized.

16:38.267 --> 16:39.333
Not to point any fingers,

16:39.333 --> 16:41.233
but it's because
of you-know-who.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.400
You're literally
pointing a finger.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.833
Who?
Knife Boy.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.467
Hector.

16:51.233 --> 16:53.567
than the average white person
or black person,

16:53.567 --> 16:55.833
but I'm certain
that Hector and the...

16:55.833 --> 16:59.133
element he attracts is in
some way responsible for this.

16:59.133 --> 17:00.833
(clearing throat)
Well, first of all,

17:00.833 --> 17:02.800
there's no sliding scale
of racism.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.500
And secondly, how do you
even know Hector was involved?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.567
This was a bit of
a tip-off.

17:10.167 --> 17:13.233
Oh.
Also, I have
security-cam footage

17:13.233 --> 17:15.367
of a kid about Hector's age
caught in the act.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.900
You can't even make out
who that i-- I'll pay for it.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.933
And please get Hector to come
clean it up tomorrow.

17:19.933 --> 17:22.100
I'll be around
from 1:00 to 3:00.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.700
I'll make him lunch.

17:27.733 --> 17:30.500
So Connor got
the wrong place?

17:30.500 --> 17:32.133
Seriously? You think
this is funny?

17:32.133 --> 17:33.967
Wait a minute, man.
Are you high?

17:33.967 --> 17:35.667
No, no.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.200
I don't think Hector
did anything wrong.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.200
He refused to have sex
with Connor's girlfriend.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.567
She asked for a tattoo
so he gave her one.

17:41.567 --> 17:42.900
Thank you for that recap.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.100
Listen, no more
tattoos, okay?

17:45.100 --> 17:46.967
And stay away from
that dude Connor

17:46.967 --> 17:48.733
and that girl
whatever-her-name-is.

17:48.733 --> 17:51.233
I will.
And thanks, George.

17:51.233 --> 17:52.800
You're welcome.
Tomorrow I'll see

17:52.800 --> 17:54.433
if I can get you
transferred from the club.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.067
I'll talk to the manager,
see if he can put you in the...

17:56.067 --> 17:57.767
probably greenskeepers,
those guys are all

17:57.767 --> 17:59.300
from Guatemala,
they don't speak English.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.833
And I gotta keep
you away from

18:00.833 --> 18:03.067
that destructive
Asian influence.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.733
Here's what you do,
you gas up the cars

18:04.733 --> 18:06.067
and I want you
to wash the dishes.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.567
And don't say that maid's
gonna do it

18:07.567 --> 18:11.100
'cause she's already here
and I'm looking at her.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.733
(man moaning)

18:16.133 --> 18:18.833
What's your number?

18:18.833 --> 18:20.600
(Pfeiffer)
Find me on Insta.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.300
(door opening, closing)

18:26.733 --> 18:28.900
What the hell are you doing?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.100
That is the exec
for George's new show.

18:31.100 --> 18:32.133
Uh, good morning.

18:32.133 --> 18:33.467
No, what did
you tell him?

18:33.467 --> 18:34.933
Does he know I live at home?

18:34.933 --> 18:36.367
Oh, you're gonna
screw this up for me

18:36.367 --> 18:37.367
like you do everything.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.867
Easy, tiger, don't worry.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.700
That dude never
shuts up about himself.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.367
He kept going on and on
about his marriage

18:42.367 --> 18:43.667
even while we were doing it.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.500
Ugh, he's married?

18:45.500 --> 18:46.833
Not happily.

18:48.533 --> 18:51.067
You're... so...

18:51.067 --> 18:53.167
(groaning)

18:54.633 --> 18:57.067
(Manolo)
I like how that grill's
coming along, jefe.

18:57.067 --> 19:00.067
Yeah, me too, Manolo.
I'm psyched.

19:00.067 --> 19:03.567
Ah, your
glasses came in, eh?

19:03.567 --> 19:05.067
Yeah, aren't they great?

19:05.067 --> 19:06.267
Yo, sometimes
they slip down,

19:06.267 --> 19:09.233
but you can push them
right back up again.

19:09.233 --> 19:12.667
Oh... that's quite
a day for you.

19:12.667 --> 19:15.133
**

19:29.333 --> 19:30.800
(George)
Hector?

19:30.800 --> 19:33.767
Oh, not Amir's wife!

19:33.767 --> 19:35.900
**

19:41.967 --> 19:44.500
* That's right, come on,
come on, come on *

19:44.500 --> 19:46.700
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

19:46.700 --> 19:48.900
* Come on (oh!),
Come on (oh!) *

19:48.900 --> 19:50.833
**

19:57.200 --> 19:58.367
* Get your hands up *

19:58.367 --> 19:59.500
* Get your hands up *

19:59.500 --> 20:00.500
* Get your hands up *

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
* Get your hands up *

20:01.500 --> 20:02.500
* Get your hands up *

20:02.500 --> 20:03.900
* Get your hands up *

20:03.900 --> 20:05.800
**
