00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
NINE MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND TWO MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:23.416 --> 00:25.750
Breakfast is served here
from eight to ten,

00:25.833 --> 00:29.791
but if you want tea at some other time,
just ask and I can make you some.

00:29.875 --> 00:31.583
Are you here visiting friends?

00:31.666 --> 00:33.250
No, I'm traveling alone.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.666
Oh, alone. How come?

00:35.750 --> 00:38.333
It's been a while since I last did it, so…

00:38.416 --> 00:39.791
Let's see how it goes.

00:39.875 --> 00:43.250
Well, you know best.
If you need anything, I'll be around.

00:43.833 --> 00:45.916
-Okay.
-Okay, make yourself at home.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.083
Thank you.

01:42.625 --> 01:44.125
-Are you Spanish?
-Yes.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.083
It's close by.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.083
-You go out…
-Yes?

01:47.166 --> 01:49.458
You go straight and you turn.

01:51.208 --> 01:52.416
Want to see the necklace?

01:53.791 --> 01:55.000
-Well…
-Come closer.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.416
It's very pretty.

02:00.375 --> 02:01.541
We make it here.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.083
Come, I show you more. Okay?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.833
-Come, my friend.
-Okay, yeah.

02:07.833 --> 02:10.291
Lamps, carpets… All is very pretty.

02:20.083 --> 02:23.666
He chooses them. And with his hands,
very artistic, he makes them.

02:24.375 --> 02:25.250
Samir.

02:32.416 --> 02:33.916
There are more surprise to see.

02:43.666 --> 02:44.541
Well, hello.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.000
Hello.

05:23.666 --> 05:24.916
Hello, my Spanish friend.

06:43.291 --> 06:45.166
Look, you have a…

09:27.916 --> 09:28.958
Whoa, it's freezing.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.666
No!

09:42.750 --> 09:44.500
You're freezing, girl.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.333
But you're so warm.

09:46.416 --> 09:48.250
You're hurting me. Come on, stop.

09:48.791 --> 09:51.166
-How can a few kisses hurt?
-Lina, stop.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.166
You'll get my book wet.

09:56.125 --> 09:56.958
Okay.

10:08.833 --> 10:09.666
What's wrong?

10:12.791 --> 10:13.625
Nothing.

10:19.666 --> 10:21.833
Lately it feels like
we're always like this.

10:25.791 --> 10:26.625
Like this, how?

10:27.791 --> 10:29.833
Well, me chasing after you, and you…

10:32.125 --> 10:33.041
not wanting to.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.166
I don't want to do it here, that's all.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.625
I don't think it has
anything to do with the place.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.041
It also happens when we're at home.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.708
This didn't happen to us before.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.041
If you say so. I don't know.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.875
THIS SERIES IS A WORK OF FICTION.
