00:26.059 --> 00:28.061
Thank you.

00:28.979 --> 00:31.648
That's perfect, Zaren. Just like that.

00:35.235 --> 00:38.071
That's OK. It's just
my friends returning.

00:55.797 --> 00:57.883
Hello, children.

00:58.050 --> 01:01.720
Daniel? No child-labour
laws here on Orban?

01:02.220 --> 01:04.221
No, these are Urrone.

01:04.388 --> 01:09.728
They're like apprentices to the
adults. They're... everywhere.

01:09.853 --> 01:12.606
It's just the way they
do things. Look at this.

01:14.441 --> 01:17.110
Chalchiutlicue. The
Aztec goddess of water.

01:19.946 --> 01:23.992
They don't even know what they've got
here. Who knows what we'll uncover!

01:24.159 --> 01:27.496
- That is, if General Hammond said yes.
- He said yes.

01:27.662 --> 01:30.332
Colonel O'Neill. You are most punctual.

01:31.416 --> 01:35.545
Merrin and I are eager to participate
in this exchange between our worlds.

01:35.712 --> 01:39.758
Major Carter is eager as well.
She's really looking forward to it.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.927
So's Teal'c.

01:42.094 --> 01:45.389
I will share my knowledge
of the Goa'uld freely.

01:46.515 --> 01:49.059
Teal'c's eager on the inside.

01:50.102 --> 01:52.104
Then, if you are ready to leave...

01:52.771 --> 01:58.110
Kalan, I thought we were bringing
back one of your naqahdah reactors.

01:59.236 --> 02:02.280
- This is the device.
- That little thing?

02:07.411 --> 02:08.787
OK.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.955
Daniel, have fun.

02:11.123 --> 02:13.125
I know you will.

02:13.792 --> 02:16.628
Teal'c... make friends. As always.

02:23.927 --> 02:26.638
Folks, to Earth.

02:26.805 --> 02:29.057
They're a most impressive society.

02:29.224 --> 02:33.979
They've accomplished in decades what it
took humans over a century to achieve.

02:34.146 --> 02:37.190
- Sounds like they'd make good allies.
- I think so.

02:37.357 --> 02:41.945
They're not up to the Goa'uld level of
technology yet, but in a few years...

02:53.040 --> 02:57.753
Thank you for this exchange. I am sure it
will be fruitful for both of our worlds.

02:57.919 --> 03:02.841
Major Carter, please allow Merrin to
present you with this naqahdah reactor.

03:05.761 --> 03:09.890
- You may study it during our exchange.
- Thank you.

03:11.016 --> 03:13.310
I would like to offer a tour of...

03:13.477 --> 03:16.271
The exchange has been made.

03:17.814 --> 03:20.901
- We will return to Orban now.
- You just got here.

03:21.068 --> 03:25.155
You can't leave. Someone needs
to teach me how to use this thing.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.410
Please explain what you mean by this.

03:30.535 --> 03:31.912
Teaching?

03:32.079 --> 03:36.541
Uh, explaining how the reactor functions
- its components, its construction.

03:37.626 --> 03:40.128
I do not have this knowledge.

03:41.546 --> 03:43.757
I will... teach you.

04:58.123 --> 05:02.210
Major Carter will show you the lab.
First, I'd like you to visit our infirmary.

05:03.754 --> 05:06.131
It's nothing to be afraid of.

05:06.298 --> 05:10.343
You must screen newcomers for
potential pathogens. Of course.

05:10.761 --> 05:14.347
So, Merrin, I understand
you're a reactor expert.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.099
Yes.

05:16.266 --> 05:18.268
- How old are you?
- I'm eleven.

05:18.435 --> 05:20.729
How old are you?

05:20.896 --> 05:22.939
So, Merrin, ...

05:23.106 --> 05:25.567
. . l understand you're a reactor expert.

05:53.762 --> 05:56.890
This is my son Tomin. He is also Urrone.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.852
Teal'c, you will please
tell him of the Goa'uld.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.736
You are most generous to
offer your knowledge, Teal'c.

06:10.654 --> 06:13.657
There was an apprentice here
- Zaren. Do you know where she went?

06:13.824 --> 06:15.700
Zaren is not here.

06:15.867 --> 06:21.915
- It was past the time of her Averium.
- Averium. Is that like a graduation?

06:22.791 --> 06:24.918
That is an approximate definition.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.629
Dr Jackson, you wished to view the city.

06:27.796 --> 06:30.465
It is best to see the
Pyramid of Suns in daylight.

06:30.799 --> 06:33.593
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Teal'c, ...

06:33.760 --> 06:36.888
. . you will please
remain here with Tomin.

06:55.741 --> 06:59.703
- What is your purpose?
- Observing your physical characteristics.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.960
Dr Jackson tells us you were
once a warrior with the Goa'uld.

07:07.544 --> 07:09.546
That is correct.

07:10.380 --> 07:14.176
I think I understand now why
the Goa'uld are so feared.

07:18.388 --> 07:20.807
Hurts a little bit, huh?

07:20.974 --> 07:23.518
You are being very brave.

07:25.562 --> 07:27.981
How's our little rocket scientist doing?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.442
We're almost done, Colonel.

07:30.609 --> 07:36.198
- I am not a rocket scientist.
- Colonel O'Neill means you're very smart.

07:36.698 --> 07:38.992
You find my intelligence level unusual?

07:39.910 --> 07:43.455
No. There are lots of
intelligent people around here.

07:43.622 --> 07:45.624
Just not as young as you.

07:45.791 --> 07:48.752
You mean you were not always
as smart as you are now?

07:48.919 --> 07:52.589
No. We spent a long time in
school to get to this point.

07:52.756 --> 07:55.467
Please explain what school is.

07:55.634 --> 07:58.762
Uh... school is a place
where you go to learn.

07:58.929 --> 08:03.392
A teacher gives you information. You
take classes to learn different subjects.

08:03.558 --> 08:06.561
So this is how you and Dr
Fraiser became scientists?

08:06.728 --> 08:08.730
Mm-hm.

08:10.065 --> 08:13.402
- You aren't a scientist?
- Oh, no.

08:13.568 --> 08:17.906
Then you are not as smart as
Major Carter and Dr Fraiser?

08:21.243 --> 08:23.537
Well, it depends on what you mean by...

08:26.581 --> 08:28.750
OK, no. I'm not.

08:28.917 --> 08:32.712
But while they were stuck in school,
I was out doing other things, ...

08:32.879 --> 08:35.298
. . like... having fun.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.847
You... do know what fun is, don't you?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.937
OK, fun is...

08:49.896 --> 08:52.691
. . what you do to make yourself happy.

08:52.858 --> 08:55.777
Like music, games.

08:56.737 --> 09:01.366
It's whatever you do when you're not
learning to be a rocket scientist.

09:02.451 --> 09:05.912
I'm here to teach Major
Carter about the reactor.

09:06.788 --> 09:09.166
Sounds like fun to me!

09:10.584 --> 09:15.672
- Whatever. Go ahead, knock yourself out.
- Come on, Merrin. I'll show you the lab.

09:16.339 --> 09:21.261
But you found hosts for other Goa'uld
as First Prime to the Goa'uld leader.

09:22.429 --> 09:26.516
I have vowed to battle the
Goa'uld and to free my people.

09:26.683 --> 09:31.813
If I let the symbiote I carry be implanted,
I would be perpetuating all that I oppose.

09:33.982 --> 09:36.860
What happens if you do not
find a host for this Goa'uld?

09:37.027 --> 09:39.029
It will die.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.700
If the Goa'uld dies,
then you will die as well?

09:47.579 --> 09:50.082
That would be unfortunate.

09:58.340 --> 10:02.344
I should have known by the murals, but
the pyramid's construction confirms it!

10:02.511 --> 10:05.514
- Dr Jackson, I do not understand.
- Teotihuacan.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.351
A city in pre-Columbian south
America, even bigger than ancient Rome.

10:09.518 --> 10:13.105
Which wouldn't mean anything
to you, but it is significant.

10:13.271 --> 10:17.359
- But you said we are Aztec.
- No, these people predated the Aztecs.

10:18.860 --> 10:22.072
OK, look. These pictures
form a narrative.

10:22.239 --> 10:26.451
Whatever's under this platform may
tell us how you came to be on Orban.

10:26.952 --> 10:29.538
You will explain this to Tomin.

10:31.623 --> 10:34.084
Wait.

10:34.251 --> 10:40.215
Teotihuacan flourished for centuries
before suffering an upheaval in 750 AD.

10:40.382 --> 10:43.802
I think you could be the
descendants of that civilisation.

10:44.636 --> 10:48.724
Do you believe the arrival of the
Goa'uld caused Teotihuacan's downfall?

10:48.890 --> 10:50.475
Yes!

10:59.401 --> 11:02.612
OK, that's the converter, right?

11:02.779 --> 11:04.823
- The heating element.
- What?

11:04.990 --> 11:07.659
W... When did we talk
about the heating element?

11:07.784 --> 11:10.829
In the very beginning, when
I described the fodinaire.

11:10.996 --> 11:13.373
Oh, man. It can't be this hard.

11:15.167 --> 11:19.171
- I will begin again.
- No, wait. Let's try this a different way.

11:19.337 --> 11:23.925
How about we break everything down
into its most basic components?

11:24.092 --> 11:27.596
Let's start with the reactor
casing. What's it made of?

11:28.680 --> 11:32.684
- The fodinaire attaches...
- No. I'm sorry, Merrin. We'll get to that.

11:32.851 --> 11:37.355
Right now, I just need to know what
materials make up the reactor casing.

11:38.690 --> 11:42.736
It'll have to block radiation,
so we'll make it lead-lined.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.905
See? This is easy.

11:45.072 --> 11:49.868
And the casing material
would have to measure...

11:50.035 --> 11:51.620
Major?

11:51.787 --> 11:55.749
If you don't mind, I'd like to
see Merrin in the infirmary again.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.878
Just a couple of follow-up tests.

12:03.173 --> 12:04.966
OK.

12:06.468 --> 12:08.470
Okey-doke.

12:14.601 --> 12:20.273
Merrin's blood shows traces of silicon,
trinium and an element I have never seen.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.151
I think it's a mineral, but
it is not found on Earth.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.947
OK, even I know that's bad.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.075
Well, I found out what was responsible.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.165
What?

12:37.332 --> 12:40.293
- A nanite.
- She has nanites in her blood?

12:40.460 --> 12:44.464
Yes. However, it still didn't explain
Merrin's high neuropeptide levels.

12:44.631 --> 12:48.051
So I did a computer-enhanced
MRl. Ready for this one?

12:54.099 --> 12:56.935
There's millions of them.

12:57.102 --> 13:00.063
They've infested that
little girl's brain.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.444
I put the base on alert.

13:05.610 --> 13:10.824
Get blood samples from everyone. I want
to know how far the nanites have spread.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.660
My nanoprocessors are harmless to you.

13:13.827 --> 13:18.874
Merrin, we've run into these little beggars
before. They're anything but harmless.

13:19.040 --> 13:23.712
We encountered a civilisation in which
the Goa'uld used a similar method...

13:23.879 --> 13:26.423
. . to accelerate the age of a population.

13:26.590 --> 13:29.676
- Colonel O'Neill was adversely affected.
- Oy!

13:29.843 --> 13:34.931
These nanites were created by Orbanians
in an Orbanian laboratory 49 years ago.

13:35.098 --> 13:38.101
All my people have them. It is
the way we acquire knowledge.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.938
Wait. You're saying all
Orbanians' brains look like this?

13:42.105 --> 13:45.734
Each citizen receives a
nanite after every Averium.

13:45.901 --> 13:48.695
Urrones are given millions
more nanites at birth...

13:48.862 --> 13:52.949
. . because we are required to learn
vast amounts of information quickly...

13:53.116 --> 13:55.786
. . before neural
pathways are established.

13:56.161 --> 13:59.414
So... these nanites act
as additional synapses?

13:59.748 --> 14:04.419
Yes. But that is all they do. They do
not age us and cannot leave the brain.

14:04.586 --> 14:07.005
But we found a nanite in your blood.

14:07.172 --> 14:10.717
If a nanite malfunctions, it
will disconnect from the brain...

14:10.884 --> 14:13.053
. . and be absorbed into the bloodstream.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.431
Those are inactive and
incapable of harming others.

14:16.598 --> 14:20.852
I'm sorry if I have alarmed you, and
I understand if you wish me to return.

14:21.019 --> 14:25.649
Oh, I don't think that would
be necessary. Do you, General?

14:25.816 --> 14:29.027
If you think it's safe, Major
Carter, you can continue to work.

14:29.194 --> 14:32.948
- But I still want blood samples, Doctor.
- Yes, sir.

14:42.999 --> 14:45.001
Father?

14:45.836 --> 14:48.547
I wish to undergo the
Averium immediately.

14:48.713 --> 14:51.216
Tomin, it is six months
until you turn 1 2.

14:51.383 --> 14:54.719
I am concerned by what Teal'c
has told me of these Goa'uld.

14:54.886 --> 14:58.557
If they learn of our
existence, they will destroy us.

14:58.724 --> 15:02.561
The studies I have made about defence
technologies must be put to use, ...

15:02.728 --> 15:05.605
. . so that Orban can begin preparations.

15:06.982 --> 15:08.984
I will notify the elders.

15:09.151 --> 15:12.154
You have learned well,
my son. I am proud.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.335
You study botany as well, Major?

15:27.502 --> 15:30.422
Oh, no. Those are just decoration.

15:33.717 --> 15:37.512
That does not look like
a naqahdah reactor core.

15:37.679 --> 15:43.351
Yeah. Well, I improvised, since we're only
using a microscopic amount of naqahdah.

15:43.518 --> 15:46.229
How about you sketch it for me?

15:46.772 --> 15:49.733
- What?
- Draw me your reactor core.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.402
Give me an idea of what it looks like.

15:55.947 --> 15:57.699
I don't draw.

15:58.742 --> 16:01.411
You don't draw? Everyone draws.

16:01.578 --> 16:06.583
No. It is not something I am required
to do. I've never had to draw before.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.211
Oh.

16:09.377 --> 16:10.545
Well, ...

16:10.712 --> 16:13.131
. . it's, uh... it's pretty easy.

16:13.298 --> 16:15.092
Here.

16:19.304 --> 16:21.098
See?

16:22.057 --> 16:24.893
- What is that?
- It's a picture of me.

16:32.317 --> 16:37.489
Well, I know it doesn't exactly look like
me, but it's just a basic representation.

16:37.656 --> 16:43.120
See, that's all I need from you
- just a basic representation of the reactor's core.

16:44.121 --> 16:45.914
All right.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.126
But this paper is not large enough.

16:49.292 --> 16:51.086
OK.

16:57.342 --> 16:59.594
- How's this?
- That will do.

17:20.824 --> 17:23.160
Kel mel, Daniel Jackson.

17:24.661 --> 17:30.000
Look at this. This proves the Goa'uld
were here in the last few hundred years.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.335
Now we just need to
figure out why they left.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.426
Dr Jackson, I brought the tools.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.139
Teal'c, you will please tell
Solen methods to fight the Goa'uld:

17:44.306 --> 17:47.309
. . which weapons and strategies
have been effective, ...

17:47.476 --> 17:51.021
. . also, anything in your experience
as First Prime to Apophis.

17:51.188 --> 17:54.858
It is an honour to accept
your knowledge, Teal'c.

17:55.567 --> 17:58.487
Perhaps it would be
better for Tomin to return.

17:58.653 --> 18:02.157
H-he is unavailable.
Solen will learn now.

18:03.241 --> 18:06.870
- Tomin is familiar with the subject.
- He has given us his knowledge.

18:07.037 --> 18:11.458
- Please, you will talk to Solen.
- But if they've established a rapport...

18:11.625 --> 18:15.754
It is impossible for Tomin to be
here. He has gone through the Averium.

18:19.925 --> 18:21.718
Please, Teal'c. Begin.

18:23.553 --> 18:26.223
I would like to see Tomin immediately.

18:30.936 --> 18:32.521
Merrin.

18:32.687 --> 18:34.940
What are you doing?! Get down.

18:35.107 --> 18:40.028
Colonel O'Neill, I need 1 5 sheets
of paper at least 48cm by 23cm.

18:40.195 --> 18:42.989
Well, that's fine. Why
don't you just ask...

18:45.909 --> 18:47.911
Excuse me.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.998
Major. Carter!

18:52.165 --> 18:53.542
Oh.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.545
Oh. Uh... Merrin, I am so sorry.

19:02.884 --> 19:04.719
Wow!

19:05.804 --> 19:07.389
Amazing.

19:07.556 --> 19:11.143
I cannot represent the
reactor core on a 3-D plane, ...

19:11.309 --> 19:14.563
. . so I depicted several layers
of the reactor's interior.

19:14.730 --> 19:20.360
- With additional supplies, I can finish it.
- Cross sections. Of course!

19:20.527 --> 19:25.157
If I scan these into the computer, I can get
a 3-D picture of the reactor's interior...

19:25.323 --> 19:29.161
All right! Will you
two... give it a rest?

19:29.327 --> 19:31.121
Both of you.

19:31.288 --> 19:34.958
You've been at this for
24 hours. You need rest.

19:35.250 --> 19:39.337
I do not need to. Urrone
children require little sleep.

19:39.504 --> 19:42.632
OK, now I am jealous.

19:42.799 --> 19:45.552
All right, Carter, you sleep.

19:45.719 --> 19:48.972
Young lady, if not sleep... fun.

19:49.139 --> 19:53.185
No! I need 1 5 sheets of
paper at least 43cm by 28cm.

19:54.853 --> 19:56.855
1 5?

19:58.065 --> 19:59.858
Colonel O'Neill?

20:00.025 --> 20:03.070
I require some of these pencils as well.

20:19.461 --> 20:21.671
Do you not recognise me?

20:22.798 --> 20:25.050
It is Teal'c.

20:27.010 --> 20:29.012
Kalan!

20:33.141 --> 20:35.685
Explain this Averium.

20:35.852 --> 20:39.398
In the ceremony, an Urrone's nanites
are removed, then distributed.

20:39.564 --> 20:44.319
Each adult and each non-Urrone child
then receives an injection of one nanite.

20:44.486 --> 20:49.366
It becomes part of their synaptic network,
adding to nanites received previously.

20:49.866 --> 20:53.578
So when you say he gave you his
knowledge, you meant it literally?

20:53.745 --> 20:56.248
It was a beautiful ceremony.

20:57.874 --> 21:00.836
Now you have seen. We must
resume our work, Dr Jackson.

21:01.002 --> 21:03.171
What will become of Tomin?

21:04.297 --> 21:08.552
- He stays here with the other past Urrone.
- That's it? You... you...

21:08.718 --> 21:12.055
- Don't you play with him?
- What is play?

21:12.764 --> 21:16.852
- Interacting, teaching him new things.
- These children cannot be taught.

21:17.018 --> 21:20.939
- Have you ever tried?
- Yes, but they can't receive new nanites.

21:21.106 --> 21:23.108
The brain rejects them.

21:23.275 --> 21:26.611
Have you ever tried teaching
them without nanites?

21:26.778 --> 21:28.989
What do you mean?

21:31.366 --> 21:34.745
There is no need for concern.
These children are well cared for.

21:34.911 --> 21:36.830
Kalan, ...

21:36.997 --> 21:38.999
. . this is your son.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.752
My son is here now.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.180
Kalan says that Tomin
is not brain-damaged, ...

21:53.346 --> 21:55.682
. . but clearly he was not himself.

21:55.849 --> 21:58.685
If the nanites have taken
over the learning process...

21:58.852 --> 22:01.438
. . and prevented normal
brain development, ...

22:01.605 --> 22:05.776
. . then there's a chance their removal
would make these children infant-like.

22:05.942 --> 22:08.445
What's the difference if
they keep 'em locked up?

22:08.612 --> 22:13.408
So once Merrin returns, she will have this
Averium and her nanites will be removed?

22:13.784 --> 22:16.286
Yes.

22:16.661 --> 22:19.081
Then maybe she won't return to Orban.

22:19.247 --> 22:24.461
- Colonel...
- General, she'll get her brain sucked out!

22:24.628 --> 22:27.589
And I dare anybody to
phrase it more delicately.

22:27.798 --> 22:30.092
Sir, I agree with you.

22:30.258 --> 22:34.012
- But we can't just keep Merrin here.
- Why not?

22:34.179 --> 22:35.972
We'd be saving her life.

22:36.139 --> 22:40.227
OK, why don't we just try asking
Kalan not to harvest Merrin's nanites?

22:40.393 --> 22:44.648
I do not believe the Orbanians will
understand the reason for your request.

22:44.815 --> 22:48.360
- They do not see this as wrong.
- We need to make them understand.

22:49.903 --> 22:51.696
Teal'c, return to Orban.

22:51.863 --> 22:57.869
Before we risk an interplanetary incident,
I'd like to try the diplomatic route first.

23:01.415 --> 23:06.461
- How can you make this demand?
- Kalan, no one is demanding anything.

23:06.628 --> 23:09.005
The Averium is not in
Merrin's best interests.

23:09.172 --> 23:11.842
It most certainly is
- for her and for her people!

23:11.967 --> 23:15.637
OK. You see, we don't believe in
doing anything that harms a child.

23:15.804 --> 23:20.934
We do not harm our children, Dr Jackson.
You saw how well Tomin is cared for!

23:21.101 --> 23:24.229
We can work this out. We just
need to discuss alternatives.

23:24.396 --> 23:27.732
There are no alternatives!
Merrin must undergo the Averium.

23:27.899 --> 23:29.985
You will return her immediately!

23:34.448 --> 23:39.244
- The Averium is a great honour.
- That's what the adults told you.

23:39.578 --> 23:43.623
But when they take out
these... nanite things, ...

23:44.833 --> 23:48.503
. . they also take out everything
that makes you... you.

23:48.837 --> 23:52.507
- But my people will have my knowledge.
- But you won't!

23:53.508 --> 23:56.428
I do not understand why
you are so concerned.

23:56.595 --> 24:01.183
Merrin, we don't think you realise what
you give up by going through an Averium.

24:01.349 --> 24:06.605
- It is a great honour to be chosen.
- Will you please... stop saying that?

24:06.772 --> 24:09.065
Colonel? A word, please?

24:14.237 --> 24:15.614
Teal'c.

24:15.781 --> 24:19.951
Kalan refused our request. Dr Jackson
is attempting to alter his position.

24:20.285 --> 24:23.580
Good. That gives us a chance
to make Merrin understand.

24:23.872 --> 24:26.124
She's already refused amnesty, Colonel.

24:26.291 --> 24:29.669
General, it's obvious the
little girl has been brainwashed.

24:29.836 --> 24:33.131
We can't send her back
without at least trying.

24:35.675 --> 24:39.471
Teal'c, do you foresee any danger
to Dr Jackson if he stays on Orban?

24:39.638 --> 24:41.723
I do not believe he will be harmed.

24:43.725 --> 24:46.186
I'll give it 48 hours.

24:48.605 --> 24:52.317
Merrin, looks like you'll be
spending a little more time with us.

24:52.484 --> 24:54.694
Please return me to Orban.

24:55.612 --> 24:57.948
You do understand we're trying to help?

24:58.573 --> 25:00.784
I don't need your help.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.544
Kalan, you can't do this.

25:10.710 --> 25:14.339
If you will not return Merrin to
us, I will retrieve her myself.

25:14.506 --> 25:19.344
If you don't transmit a special code,
they will close the iris. You will die.

25:21.221 --> 25:23.640
Please explain this iris.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.185
I will explain it, but only to you.

25:27.352 --> 25:32.232
- If you won't explain it, transmit the code.
- I'm sorry.

25:32.399 --> 25:37.571
You claim to love knowledge, yet now
you demand we change to please you!

25:37.738 --> 25:39.948
No, it is not to please me!

25:40.115 --> 25:44.578
You are an advanced society. Can't you
find a better way to educate your people?

25:44.745 --> 25:48.123
- There is no better way.
- Even if it means giving up your son?

25:48.290 --> 25:52.210
It was the happiest day of my life
when Tomin was selected to be Urrone.

25:52.377 --> 25:56.840
I knew even before he was born that he
would make a contribution to our society.

25:57.007 --> 26:01.511
- You never once thought otherwise?
- Not once. And neither did Tomin.

26:02.012 --> 26:04.556
And what if Merrin does?

26:06.475 --> 26:09.519
Merrin is one of only
a few Urrone children, ...

26:09.686 --> 26:13.815
. . and the only one to have spent ten
years learning the naqahdah technology.

26:13.982 --> 26:17.986
Without her Averium, those awaiting
her knowledge for their research...

26:18.153 --> 26:21.782
. . will have to wait 1 2 years
for another Urrone to learn.

26:22.449 --> 26:25.410
Well, I didn't know that.

26:26.161 --> 26:28.246
Merrin does.

26:28.413 --> 26:30.499
She does not question her duty.

26:30.665 --> 26:36.004
It is you, Dr Jackson, who are misguided
to think you can convince her otherwise.

26:47.390 --> 26:51.186
Come on! Why, why,
why aren't you working?

26:53.897 --> 26:57.818
- She insisted on seeing you, Major.
- It's all right. Thanks.

26:58.944 --> 27:00.320
Hey.

27:00.487 --> 27:03.657
Major Carter? I need your assistance.

27:03.824 --> 27:08.370
You must tell General Hammond
to let me return to Orban.

27:09.579 --> 27:13.375
I thought, as a scientist,
you would understand.

27:13.542 --> 27:15.836
Merrin, you're only 1 1.

27:16.962 --> 27:21.425
Half the interesting things in my
life didn't happen till I turned 1 5.

27:21.591 --> 27:26.054
- What kind of interesting things?
- Oh... just, uh...

27:26.221 --> 27:28.598
. . stuff.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.727
If it were possible, ...

27:32.894 --> 27:36.106
. . l would give you one of my nanites, ...

27:36.773 --> 27:39.734
. . and then you would
know that it's all right.

27:39.901 --> 27:43.989
Thank you, but I don't think
that would make a difference.

27:45.157 --> 27:47.617
You are finished?

27:47.784 --> 27:50.120
Almost.

27:50.287 --> 27:55.292
Once I ran a computer simulation of your
sketches, I thought I'd adapt the design.

27:55.459 --> 27:58.962
But the current is being diverted
before it reaches the core.

27:59.129 --> 28:02.883
I think the shielding
might be diverting power.

28:03.049 --> 28:06.178
- Major Carter...
- Unless... Hey, hey, hey!

28:06.344 --> 28:09.389
. . the trinium is absorbing the current.

28:09.556 --> 28:12.225
- Correct. All you...
- Wait! Sorry, let me.

28:16.146 --> 28:20.358
OK. By reversing the polarity...

28:22.903 --> 28:25.781
That's it! We're in business!

28:27.741 --> 28:30.744
Why wouldn't you let me
give you the solution?

28:30.911 --> 28:33.455
What would have been the fun in that?

28:34.581 --> 28:36.792
Fun?

28:36.958 --> 28:42.297
Yeah. Figuring something out on my own,
especially if it's been eluding me a while.

28:42.464 --> 28:46.218
It's far more satisfying than
having the answer given to me.

28:46.384 --> 28:49.054
But not as efficient.

28:51.598 --> 28:53.892
Come in.

28:54.059 --> 28:56.061
You...

28:58.021 --> 29:03.026
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Kalan has come to escort Merrin back.

29:04.111 --> 29:07.447
Before you say anything, know
that I have granted his request.

29:07.989 --> 29:13.078
I don't like it either, but you don't know
the effect this is having on the Orbanians.

29:14.371 --> 29:16.873
What about the effect
it's having on Merrin?

29:17.040 --> 29:20.919
Dr Jackson has come to realise
Merrin's importance to her people.

29:23.130 --> 29:25.966
Her importance as a vegetable?

29:26.258 --> 29:29.010
- Colonel!
- If you would try to understand...

29:29.177 --> 29:31.513
No! I won't.

29:33.849 --> 29:38.019
The way you treat your children
is absurd. You don't deserve them.

29:38.186 --> 29:42.357
- Colonel O'Neill!
- Request permission to be excused, sir!

29:47.571 --> 29:50.282
OK, clear.

29:55.537 --> 29:57.539
We did it!

29:58.248 --> 30:01.168
Let me record these readings.

30:01.334 --> 30:04.463
- What the heck was that?
- The reactor worked.

30:07.591 --> 30:08.967
Carter.

30:09.134 --> 30:13.221
Yes, sir. We're fine.
It was just the reactor.

30:13.388 --> 30:17.350
No, sir, just an initial energy
pulse. There's no threat to the base.

30:22.522 --> 30:24.775
It's all right, airman, I've got it.

30:38.789 --> 30:41.666
You are taking me to the surface?

30:43.794 --> 30:45.796
Yes.

30:48.215 --> 30:51.176
Look, you came here to learn, right?

30:51.343 --> 30:56.098
There's something I have to show you, but
I have to take you off the base for it.

30:57.099 --> 30:59.893
You do not have permission.

31:00.060 --> 31:02.062
Do you?

31:03.063 --> 31:05.482
No. I don't.

31:05.649 --> 31:09.361
In the future, Major, before
you activate any reactor, ...

31:09.820 --> 31:13.490
- . . l'd appreciate it ifyou'd notify me.
- It won't happen again.

31:13.657 --> 31:15.075
Good.

31:15.242 --> 31:19.287
- I'd like to see Merrin in my office.
- Colonel O'Neill just left with her.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.127
Thank you, Major.

31:27.921 --> 31:32.843
This is Hammond. If Colonel O'Neill
attempts to leave, you're ordered to...

31:34.052 --> 31:36.054
How long ago?

31:39.141 --> 31:41.685
I see.

31:46.606 --> 31:50.318
- This is a school?
- It's part of it.

31:50.485 --> 31:52.487
We call this the playground.

31:53.071 --> 31:56.116
What is it for?

31:56.283 --> 31:58.076
Well, just watch.

32:03.206 --> 32:05.667
Bambinas!

32:05.834 --> 32:07.836
Pizzeria! Mamma mia!

32:08.003 --> 32:11.673
- Colonel Jack, what're you doing here?
- Playing hooky.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.676
Kids, I want you to
meet my friend Merrin.

32:14.843 --> 32:18.430
Think you can show her around
while I talk to Mrs Struble?

32:36.281 --> 32:38.074
Colonel O'Neill!

32:38.241 --> 32:41.995
The kids have been asking when
you're coming back to see us.

32:43.121 --> 32:47.375
- How's Cassandra enjoying junior high?
- She's doing fine. She loves it.

32:47.542 --> 32:51.379
Listen, do you have room for
another student this afternoon?

32:55.842 --> 32:58.136
She's... visiting...

32:58.303 --> 33:00.472
. . from out of town.

33:01.473 --> 33:05.102
- We have art scheduled after recess.
- That's perfect.

33:09.272 --> 33:13.443
Your assignment is to
paint something you love.

33:13.610 --> 33:17.781
Now, it could be a
person or... an object.

33:17.948 --> 33:20.367
Just... use your imaginations.

33:37.759 --> 33:41.012
- I look fat.
- Colonel O'Neill?

33:46.393 --> 33:49.729
This brush is too wide to
accurately render the wires.

33:49.896 --> 33:52.107
OK, let's try this again.

33:56.111 --> 33:59.156
Something you love.

33:59.656 --> 34:02.534
Something that's not a machine, OK?

34:04.244 --> 34:07.789
Remember the flowers in Major
Carter's lab? The ones on the desk?

34:07.956 --> 34:11.333
Paint one of those. Go ahead.

34:18.341 --> 34:20.510
Bigger!

34:22.387 --> 34:24.181
Big.

34:34.565 --> 34:37.027
There is no purple.

34:38.570 --> 34:40.781
Use red.

34:41.907 --> 34:44.074
If I could have another cup, ...

34:44.242 --> 34:47.454
- . . l could mix the blue with the red...
- Make the flower red.

34:47.621 --> 34:49.748
But those flowers were purple!

34:49.915 --> 34:52.751
You ask me to draw, but you
do not give me the means...

34:53.043 --> 34:55.629
Merrin... Iisten to me.

34:56.922 --> 34:59.716
It doesn't have to be exact.

34:59.883 --> 35:02.385
Paint me a flower.

35:03.929 --> 35:06.348
I don't care what it looks like. Here.

35:07.974 --> 35:11.603
Use this. And don't stop with
one. Paint the whole garden.

35:11.770 --> 35:14.272
- But...
- Ah!

35:15.440 --> 35:17.442
Paint.

35:49.558 --> 35:51.351
Nice.

35:52.185 --> 35:56.273
- Who's that?
- It's a representation of Major Carter.

35:58.358 --> 36:00.360
Of course it is.

36:01.778 --> 36:03.780
Is it right?

36:04.865 --> 36:07.701
Oh, yeah. It's way more than right.

36:13.081 --> 36:16.209
Thank you, Colonel O'Neill,
for teaching this to me.

36:17.836 --> 36:20.172
You're welcome.

36:21.339 --> 36:23.341
Merrin.

36:24.384 --> 36:28.472
All you have to do is ask. I'll
find a way to make it happen.

36:31.349 --> 36:35.228
I have a duty to my people. My
knowledge is important to them.

36:37.230 --> 36:39.524
You did promise.

36:48.492 --> 36:53.580
Unfortunately, the test used up the last
of our naqahdah, but we'll find more.

36:53.747 --> 36:56.291
At least we've got a working prototype.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.044
Colonel?

37:01.088 --> 37:04.466
- I'm not here to cause trouble, sir.
- Colonel O'Neill?

37:07.677 --> 37:09.846
I have something for you.

37:19.481 --> 37:22.150
They're beautiful. Thank you.

37:28.573 --> 37:33.745
- You are mad at me for not staying.
- No. No, I'm not.

37:34.204 --> 37:36.623
Then you understand?

37:46.133 --> 37:50.262
Major Carter, please take Merrin to
the gate room. I'll be there soon.

37:50.429 --> 37:51.805
Yes, sir.

38:01.189 --> 38:05.986
You've already given me more than
enough reason for a court martial.

38:07.112 --> 38:09.322
General, ...

38:09.489 --> 38:13.869
. . for a few hours today I got to
show that little girl how to be a kid.

38:14.995 --> 38:17.497
If you want to punish me, ...

38:18.623 --> 38:20.750
. . go ahead.

38:45.275 --> 38:47.819
On behalf of the citizens of Orban, ...

38:47.986 --> 38:52.783
. . l'd like to thank you for the experience
you have given me and to my people.

38:53.575 --> 38:56.828
- I have learned much in my time here.
- So have we.

39:29.402 --> 39:33.824
We received a transmission from Orban.
Kalan asked for all of you to go there.

39:33.990 --> 39:38.203
- Is something wrong?
- You'll find out when you get there.

39:48.046 --> 39:50.132
Thank you for coming!

39:50.298 --> 39:53.844
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing is wrong! I will show you!

40:10.110 --> 40:11.695
Come.

40:11.862 --> 40:13.905
Look!

40:14.072 --> 40:16.533
Isn't it wonderful?

40:31.506 --> 40:33.508
Solen... Solen.

40:35.719 --> 40:39.431
Colonel O'Neill, this is my
son Tomin. I am teaching him.

40:40.307 --> 40:42.851
All of the past Urrone
children will now learn...

40:43.018 --> 40:46.146
. . in the "old-fashioned
way", as you might say.

40:47.063 --> 40:50.150
He will know all that
you have done for Orban.

40:52.652 --> 40:55.906
Oh, l... I drew this for you.

40:58.617 --> 41:00.619
To express my gratitude.

41:06.166 --> 41:07.959
- Isn't that...
- Me!

41:12.464 --> 41:16.218
- Kalan, when did all this start?
- Last night, after Merrin's Averium.

41:16.384 --> 41:19.054
She must have known this would happen.

41:19.387 --> 41:21.890
This... is what she learned.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.562
Colonel.

41:58.051 --> 42:00.262
Hi, Merrin.

42:07.102 --> 42:09.104
OK.

42:11.648 --> 42:16.361
I guess we'll just have to get to
know one another all over again.

42:36.173 --> 42:39.217
You're right. What was I thinking?

42:43.430 --> 42:46.308
Have you ever seen a dog?

42:46.475 --> 42:49.311
Dogs are my favourite people.

42:50.270 --> 42:53.106
Some have tails, some don't.

42:54.733 --> 42:56.735
There are a lot of purple dogs...

42:57.305 --> 43:03.768
