00:08.320 --> 00:10.480
Welcome the Frog Skull Island.

00:10.519 --> 00:13.000
It’s a stunning vista
of a crossing.

00:13.039 --> 00:14.439
What’s your favorite, most
beautiful part

00:14.480 --> 00:15.880
of this to look at, Wayans?

00:15.919 --> 00:17.640
- Um... like the mermaid.
- You do?

00:17.679 --> 00:20.239
I like the little moon with
the little frog inside of it.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.519
That’s an Easter egg here.

00:21.559 --> 00:23.079
Someone worked really
hard on that.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.600
My one critique: all the
clouds look the same.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.399
You’re right,
it’s a terrible course.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.000
Terrible course,
scrap the whole thing.

00:30.039 --> 00:31.320
They are, they’re identical.

00:31.359 --> 00:32.520
You know what they did?

00:32.560 --> 00:34.119
They designed the whole course
and they said,

00:34.159 --> 00:35.719
screw it, I’m going to
mail-in the clouds.

00:35.759 --> 00:37.119
No one will notice.

00:37.159 --> 00:40.920
Control-C, control-V.
Control-C, control-V.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.920
Control-Alt-Delete.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.679
Tonight on "Frogger"...

00:45.719 --> 00:47.399
- Oh my God!
- Woo!

00:47.439 --> 00:49.200
Rattle your cutlass.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.840
He’s taking heavy
punishment.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.719
Six swashbuckling Froggers.

00:54.759 --> 00:55.679
Woo!

00:55.719 --> 00:57.000
You are wasting time, my friend!

00:57.039 --> 00:59.200
- Woo!
- Let’s go!

00:59.240 --> 01:02.240
Take on three buccaneering
crossings.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.240
Oh my goodness!

01:03.280 --> 01:05.359
I just peed a little bit.
I did.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.760
- Damon has wet his pants.
- I peed.

01:06.799 --> 01:08.040
I peed a little bit.

01:08.079 --> 01:10.400
Who will make it to the
Boss Toad Bonus Round?

01:10.439 --> 01:12.200
- Oh!
- Man!

01:12.239 --> 01:14.239
And haul in
a pirate’s booty?

01:14.280 --> 01:16.599
Ah! How you like
them apples?

01:16.640 --> 01:18.319
Arrr!

01:18.359 --> 01:22.000
It’s the $10,000
Golden Fanny Pack.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.120
- I’m Damon Wayans Jr.
- I’m Kyle Brandt.

01:24.159 --> 01:26.400
- And this is "Frogger".
- And this is "Frogger".

01:29.799 --> 01:32.040
All right, the coin
slot is loaded...

01:32.079 --> 01:33.920
And this crossing is
going to be incredible.

01:33.959 --> 01:35.319
So much fun.
This place is epic.

01:35.359 --> 01:36.599
Let’s roll.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.200
From the first rope swing
to the moving planks,

01:39.239 --> 01:41.680
Froggers must board
the Jolly Frogger

01:41.719 --> 01:45.120
and grab a cracker for Polly
the Parrot’s ride to the beach.

01:45.159 --> 01:47.359
They’ll pass
Devil Skull Rock

01:47.400 --> 01:48.519
and the gators.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.200
Pelted by water cannons,

01:50.239 --> 01:51.920
they’ll make their way
across the lilies,

01:51.959 --> 01:55.599
to the spinning X
with a final leap home.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.920
The short cut from the ship
to the lilies

01:57.959 --> 02:00.200
is even tougher.

02:00.239 --> 02:02.920
First to walk the plank tonight

02:02.959 --> 02:07.560
is Kevin Beverly
versus Roland Hanagan.

02:07.599 --> 02:09.120
My name is Kevin.

02:09.159 --> 02:11.039
I’m 31 years old,
I’m from Chicago, Illinois.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.080
And I’m an acrobat
and circus artist.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.560
I would say that I’ve been
training elite level

02:15.599 --> 02:16.919
my whole life.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.319
I worked for Cirque du Soleil
for three years.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.680
I did a North American tour,
which was amazing.

02:20.719 --> 02:23.560
I have what it takes
to win "Frogger"

02:23.599 --> 02:25.439
because this
is what I do.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.919
I have no doubt that
this is my game.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.199
Hi, I’m Roland,
I’m 21 years old,

02:30.240 --> 02:31.960
and I’m a parkour and
gymnastics coach

02:32.000 --> 02:33.439
from Greenville,
South Carolina.

02:33.479 --> 02:35.840
I’m on "Frogger" because
I’m literally a frog.

02:35.879 --> 02:39.159
With parkour, you’re using your
arms to vault over obstacles.

02:39.199 --> 02:40.919
I’ve flipped across
rooftops,

02:40.960 --> 02:43.879
I leap, I jump.
I love playing in the mud.

02:43.919 --> 02:45.840
Anything a frog can do,
I can do.

02:45.879 --> 02:47.759
I am super competitive.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.759
The second a competition starts,

02:49.800 --> 02:52.520
I’m going to crush them.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.199
- Are you ready for this?
- I am ready.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.439
There is a buzz in the
world of Frogger right now.

02:56.479 --> 03:00.520
Think about this as two one
seeds in the NCAA tournament.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.000
- Well, I’m excited, bro.
- Dude, yes.

03:02.039 --> 03:04.719
This is parkour
versus circus.

03:04.759 --> 03:06.520
Dude, we got this for sure.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.080
What is parkour?

03:08.120 --> 03:09.680
You know that sport where

03:09.719 --> 03:12.439
people jump from one building
to the next building

03:12.479 --> 03:14.039
messing up people’s property,
stuff like that?

03:14.080 --> 03:15.400
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That’s parkour.

03:15.439 --> 03:17.479
- And this dude is into that?
- Yeah.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.000
So Roland is a nuisance.

03:19.039 --> 03:20.159
A professional nuisance.

03:21.639 --> 03:23.479
Ready, Frogger 1?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.560
Here we go.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.800
Kevin Beverly, 5’10", 165 pounds

03:29.840 --> 03:33.439
a circus freak, this guy seems
like he’s in complete control

03:33.479 --> 03:34.879
right off the bat.

03:34.919 --> 03:37.520
Cargo net,
strong grip right there.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.879
He has a decision to make,
conservative approach.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.719
Stay left, get the cracker
out of the barrel.

03:41.759 --> 03:44.719
You go to the right, you
take the shortcut, risk it all

03:44.759 --> 03:47.400
to take your chances
with the rope.

03:47.439 --> 03:49.680
He is taking the shortcut.

03:49.719 --> 03:50.919
Oh, no.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.080
This has never been
done successfully.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.520
He is playing to win on the
single rope shortcut.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.520
What the hell?

03:57.560 --> 03:58.840
Dude, that’s insane!

03:58.879 --> 04:00.520
I don’t know what he’s doing.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.159
He’s putting on some kind
of circus performance.

04:02.199 --> 04:03.199
Oh!

04:04.479 --> 04:06.000
Dang.

04:06.039 --> 04:07.520
This man is built
to last.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.240
He’s hanging on a fine
trapeze right now

04:09.280 --> 04:12.680
in a three ring circus,
this is compelling Frogger.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.439
And he’s down!

04:14.479 --> 04:17.120
This is a shame, because
he handled the shortcut.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.920
Watch how he points
his toes.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.199
Oh, yeah.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.399
Graceful.

04:22.439 --> 04:24.399
It’s gorgeous.
It’s beautiful.

04:24.439 --> 04:27.120
- It’s glorious to watch.
- It’s ballet.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.439
You know my favorite letter
in the alphabet

04:28.480 --> 04:30.759
is actually W, cause...
I only win.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.879
Give me your hands and
let’s get you a little wet.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.120
Ooh, ooh.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.519
You almost got me
there, sir.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.600
- No, boy.
- Uh-uh, I’m not getting wet.

04:37.639 --> 04:38.759
Ready, Frogger 2?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.040
Here we go!

04:40.079 --> 04:42.920
Young Roland, only
21 years old,

04:42.959 --> 04:44.720
the parkour master.

04:44.759 --> 04:46.560
So you just saw Kevin
attempt a shortcut

04:46.600 --> 04:48.759
and come up really close.
What would you do?

04:48.800 --> 04:50.319
Uh, I would avoid
the shortcut.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.279
Especially at that size,
he’s 5’3".

04:52.319 --> 04:53.360
Oh, there we go.

04:53.399 --> 04:55.040
So comfortable,
so calm.

04:55.079 --> 04:55.879
Attaboy.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.120
There parkour guys are freaks.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.319
There’s a pattern
to it, Kevin.

04:58.360 --> 05:01.000
These guys, Wayans,
don’t even think

05:01.040 --> 05:02.199
about going up to the deck.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.439
Its shortcut or nothing,
and I love it.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.519
I gave it a little flair,
a little technique,

05:06.560 --> 05:07.800
just for the audience.

05:07.839 --> 05:11.040
He looks like a trained
expert right now.

05:11.079 --> 05:13.079
Oh, this is great.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.480
But can he make this jump?

05:14.519 --> 05:16.199
Wow!

05:16.240 --> 05:17.279
Yo!

05:17.319 --> 05:18.920
No that’s how you
do "Frogger".

05:18.959 --> 05:20.279
Incredible.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.920
He is the first Frogger
to land the shortcut.

05:22.959 --> 05:27.319
But can he be the first
to conquer Punk Rock?

05:27.360 --> 05:30.199
This is ridiculous
how amazing this has been.

05:33.879 --> 05:35.240
Oh my gosh!

05:35.279 --> 05:36.680
- Oh, wow!
- We’ve got a champ!

05:36.720 --> 05:39.639
Waving the flag
will stop the cannons.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.240
Ahoy, matie!

05:41.279 --> 05:42.240
Come on, pirate.

05:42.279 --> 05:43.680
How do you like
them apples, Kevin?

05:43.720 --> 05:45.160
Come on, pirate.

05:45.199 --> 05:46.680
He’s talking, he’s a chirper,
isn’t he?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.439
This frog can croak.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.319
Oh my gosh, he’s only
two jumps away now!

05:51.360 --> 05:52.319
This is crazy.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.000
Ooh, that is a fast
spinning X.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.920
We’re in new territory here
on Frog Skull Island.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.959
Everything is a first.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.879
Up next, the spinning X.

06:01.920 --> 06:06.240
Spins 15 times per minute
at 500 pounds.

06:06.279 --> 06:08.079
He almost seemed
a little rattled.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.160
It’s the first time we’ve seen
him show any vulnerability.

06:10.199 --> 06:12.560
Ladies and gentlemen,
the biggest jump of his life.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.199
Oh, no, he’s off! He’s off!

06:15.240 --> 06:18.160
What an unbelievable fail!

06:18.199 --> 06:22.040
He careened across
the X and went in.

06:22.079 --> 06:23.959
That was so close!

06:25.199 --> 06:26.600
It’s over, I don’t care
what kind

06:26.639 --> 06:29.720
of a park you’re a master of.
You’re in.

06:29.759 --> 06:32.160
You know, Kevin?
My dad’s name is Kevin,

06:32.199 --> 06:34.480
and he definitely couldn’t
finish this course,

06:34.519 --> 06:36.319
so... I just want you
to keep that in mind.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.480
I am almost as old
as your dad, so...

06:38.519 --> 06:40.439
Oh, dang,
you’re almost retired?

06:40.480 --> 06:42.120
[laughing]

06:42.160 --> 06:43.680
- I like them smack talking.
- Yeah.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.399
The boy be talking too much.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.920
Oh, baby!

06:46.959 --> 06:49.279
Oh, the hand.

06:49.319 --> 06:54.519
Second life for Kevin Beverly,
Chicago, Illinois.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.240
Remember, he got this
far last time.

06:56.279 --> 06:59.399
and had a very close miss
with the first lily pad.

06:59.439 --> 07:02.319
What will he do differently
here around?

07:02.360 --> 07:04.199
- Oh!
- Yeah!

07:04.240 --> 07:06.759
- That was great.
- Wow.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.959
I’ll give him that.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.600
That was impressive.

07:09.639 --> 07:11.560
- He just blew him a kiss.
- He just blew him a kiss.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.040
Love you, too, Kevin.

07:13.079 --> 07:15.879
Circus versus parkour.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.519
Now we’ve got something,
the gloves are off.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.519
Wow.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.680
Ahoy, matie!
Ahoy!

07:21.720 --> 07:23.639
Ooh, all right, all right.

07:23.680 --> 07:24.560
Ahoy!

07:24.600 --> 07:25.519
It’s getting good.

07:25.560 --> 07:26.519
That’s for you.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.199
Love you, buddy.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.319
I’d love you a little more if
you were in the water right now.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.759
We got to get Roland
a headset and a mic.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.720
Ooh!

07:34.759 --> 07:36.920
No problem, and here we go.

07:36.959 --> 07:39.000
What did Kevin
learn from Roland?

07:39.040 --> 07:40.439
This is why we signed up.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.959
"Frogger" doesn’t
get any better.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.759
This is where he fell
the last time.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.120
Dude, this is so nerve-wracking.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.439
The spinning X,
soaking wet.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.560
- He’s off... he’s got it.
- Wow.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.120
Ooh!

07:52.160 --> 07:54.600
Could Kevin be
the first person

07:54.639 --> 07:57.120
the conquer Frog Skull Island?

07:57.160 --> 08:00.720
If he can time the rotation
and jump onto the final mat...

08:00.759 --> 08:02.560
- We’ve... got it!
- Oh, yeah!

08:02.600 --> 08:05.360
Yeah! Yeah!

08:05.399 --> 08:08.639
Kevin Beverly gets
the treasure!

08:08.680 --> 08:09.920
- All right.
- Oh!

08:09.959 --> 08:11.000
He took the shortcut.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.319
He is now the first to conquer

08:13.360 --> 08:15.160
Frog Skull Island.

08:15.199 --> 08:17.120
- Woo!
- The word you hear is clutch.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.399
You hear it in hitting
the free throws in the NBA.

08:20.439 --> 08:24.000
The goal in the NHL,
and that crossing in Frogger.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.600
Doesn’t get more
clutch than that.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.759
- I’m bringing this back, mwa.
- The chef’s kiss!

08:28.800 --> 08:29.959
Yes, mwa!

08:30.000 --> 08:31.439
The frog’s kiss!

08:31.480 --> 08:33.399
Who’s retired now?

08:33.440 --> 08:34.879
Oh!

08:34.919 --> 08:36.320
That is not what I wanted
to bee, gonna be honest.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.039
This is high stakes
stuff, here.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.879
Roland needs this
to force the tie-breaker.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.919
If he falls here,
he goes home.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.720
We’ve seen and heard of
Froggers falling

08:45.759 --> 08:46.919
right at the goal line.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.279
This is the Super Bowl,
the World Series

08:49.320 --> 08:50.639
and WrestleMania
combined.

08:50.679 --> 08:52.240
I’m really worried
because this thing was

08:52.279 --> 08:54.279
way more slippery than
I thought it was gonna be.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.039
This is sudden death,
do or die.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.440
And the jump...
he’s got it.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.879
Wow.

08:58.919 --> 09:02.120
He’s in control. Can he finish
and force a tiebreaker?

09:02.159 --> 09:03.799
That’s not too far.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.759
21 year old Roland Hanagan,

09:16.799 --> 09:19.440
can he finish and
force a tie-breaker?

09:19.480 --> 09:21.639
- Look at the tension.
- I’m nervous.

09:21.679 --> 09:23.440
Palms are sweating, and...

09:23.480 --> 09:25.440
Oh, he slipped!

09:25.480 --> 09:27.360
- He’s holding on!
- Oh, oh!

09:27.399 --> 09:28.159
He’s holding on!

09:28.200 --> 09:29.200
All right, we’re there!

09:29.240 --> 09:31.200
- Oh...
- Oh my gosh!

09:31.240 --> 09:32.000
Ooh!

09:32.039 --> 09:33.159
Is that good?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.240
And he’s got it!

09:35.279 --> 09:37.000
Wow!

09:37.039 --> 09:38.279
Let’s go!

09:38.320 --> 09:40.200
- Let’s go!
- Oh my goodness!

09:40.240 --> 09:42.000
Wow!

09:42.039 --> 09:43.559
Dude, let’s go!

09:43.600 --> 09:44.759
Oh my gosh.

09:44.799 --> 09:47.000
Can we please watch
that replay?

09:47.039 --> 09:49.399
- It’s a game of inches.
- Oh!

09:49.440 --> 09:52.000
Watch the fingertips.

09:52.039 --> 09:54.360
He held onto that
like a building.

09:54.399 --> 09:55.679
Spectacular!

09:55.720 --> 09:57.120
You know what’s the best part?

09:57.159 --> 10:00.600
We built this up to
the showdown of the century,

10:00.639 --> 10:04.399
parkour versus circus
and now we get more!

10:04.440 --> 10:06.000
This is good, tire yourself out,
this is great.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.440
This is great.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.440
This is the biggest
moment in "Frogger" history.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.799
Kevin and Roland are heading
to our first ever tie breaker.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.600
If they both complete
the crossing,

10:16.639 --> 10:19.279
which ever does
it fastest wins.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.679
Can they use the shortcut?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.519
The shortcut is out.

10:22.559 --> 10:25.879
I cannot wait.
I am so excited right now.

10:25.919 --> 10:26.840
Ready, Frogger?

10:26.879 --> 10:27.720
Oh, I’m ready.

10:27.759 --> 10:29.679
Here we go.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.440
Parkour versus circus.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.720
Winner takes all.

10:32.759 --> 10:34.639
This is the playoffs right now.

10:34.679 --> 10:36.200
Right out of the gate.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.080
You’ve got to be fast,
but you can’t be reckless.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.039
Nice catch, nice catch!

10:41.080 --> 10:42.320
Cannot go to the shortcut,
he’s got to go to

10:42.360 --> 10:44.600
the barrel of crackers
and make his way

10:44.639 --> 10:47.080
across the ship.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.120
Yeah, his height is
a little issue here.

10:49.159 --> 10:51.399
Polly is a tall
drink of water up there.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.360
Come here, Polly!

10:52.399 --> 10:54.159
I need to get
this done, dude.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.960
First ever meeting
with Polly.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.360
They really made this hard
for a short lad like me.

10:58.399 --> 11:00.200
Finding out if
the height is a factor.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.039
5’3" only, doesn’t seem
to be a problem.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.000
Oh, this is sick!

11:05.039 --> 11:06.480
Here we go.

11:06.519 --> 11:09.840
It is sick until
you stick the landing though.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.639
Oh! Beautiful.

11:12.679 --> 11:13.480
He’s so good.

11:13.519 --> 11:14.759
Oh, nice.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.480
This is where he lives,
this is parkour embodied.

11:17.519 --> 11:18.600
This is meat and
potatoes for him.

11:18.639 --> 11:19.759
Yeah.

11:19.799 --> 11:21.720
Gets out of bed
doing this stuff.

11:21.759 --> 11:24.039
Gets up... oh, that was great.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.279
We have never seen someone

11:25.320 --> 11:26.840
move this fast
through this crossing.

11:26.879 --> 11:29.639
That parkour experience is
just really showing right now.

11:29.679 --> 11:32.000
Watch out, baby’s slippery!

11:32.039 --> 11:34.399
First gator, all right,
we’ve got a full mount.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.759
Gator time, it’s gator time.

11:36.799 --> 11:38.840
Second gator.

11:38.879 --> 11:40.159
Okay, no problem.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.600
Steve, our most
temperamental gator,

11:43.639 --> 11:46.039
says let’s go for a ride.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.840
At this rate, he’s going to
be the first person

11:47.879 --> 11:52.240
to cross Frog
Skull Island twice.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.799
[grunts]

11:53.840 --> 11:54.919
Oh, no!

11:56.360 --> 11:57.519
He’s done!

11:57.559 --> 11:58.440
And he’s down!

11:58.480 --> 11:59.559
Oh no.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.600
Frogger down.

12:01.639 --> 12:04.080
The parkour guy goes swimming.

12:04.120 --> 12:04.879
All right, you did good.

12:04.919 --> 12:06.399
You did very good.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.039
All right, Damon, so
here’s where we’re at.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.320
Should Kevin make the jump
to Punk Rock, he wins.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.600
If he comes up shorter
than Punk Rock,

12:13.639 --> 12:14.720
he loses.

12:14.759 --> 12:15.759
Game over.

12:15.799 --> 12:16.840
Oh, I’m excited.

12:16.879 --> 12:17.600
Here we go.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.960
Kevin Beverly, from
Chicago, Illinois.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
This is your moment,
the circus is in town.

12:26.039 --> 12:27.440
- Ooh.
- Ooh!

12:27.480 --> 12:29.600
Don’t blow it here,
though my man.

12:29.639 --> 12:31.360
Not as easy as it seems.

12:31.399 --> 12:33.519
Up the cargo net, this will
be his first time

12:33.559 --> 12:35.240
going to the barrel of crackers

12:35.279 --> 12:37.279
because we pointed out, in
overtime there is no shortcut.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.639
Polly! Polly!

12:38.679 --> 12:39.919
Let’s go for a ride, baby.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.000
Come on!

12:41.039 --> 12:41.840
Here comes Polly.

12:41.879 --> 12:43.360
This is nice so far.

12:43.399 --> 12:45.919
Kevin looks so comfortable
on the bar, Wayans,

12:45.960 --> 12:47.799
that’s years of training.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.200
Oh, dude, that looks
so sick.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.799
And look at that, look at how
he moves his legs

12:50.840 --> 12:52.039
to get momentum.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.799
Got it. Oh!

12:53.840 --> 12:55.960
That was beautiful!

12:56.000 --> 12:57.320
Come on, now.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.600
No you’re showing off,
No hesitation.

12:58.639 --> 13:00.080
Oh, dude.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.120
Here we go, right off the edge.

13:02.159 --> 13:05.000
Smooth.

13:05.039 --> 13:06.759
As we approach
Devil Skull Rock,

13:06.799 --> 13:08.840
he won’t have the same
advantage as Roland

13:08.879 --> 13:11.200
because he’s not as small but
he still goes the same route.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.720
Gets his feet wet,
but he’s alive.

13:12.759 --> 13:13.720
Wow.

13:13.759 --> 13:15.159
No way.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.759
Roland is so nervous right now.

13:16.799 --> 13:18.080
Oops!

13:18.120 --> 13:19.519
Yeah, his timing is
really good right now.

13:19.559 --> 13:22.440
If he can get even so much
as Punk Rock, he wins.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.519
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

13:23.559 --> 13:25.399
I’ve never seen anybody
stand up fully.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.919
Hey, just go for
a swim right now, Kevin.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.039
How do you jump like that?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.600
Constant running commentary
from Roland as always.

13:36.639 --> 13:38.039
And we’re on to the third gator.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.799
One slip of the foot and
his "Frogger" life is over.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.080
Dude, I love Kevin, but I hope
he falls in, dude.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.039
- And he’s off.
- Wow.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.240
He’s got it.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.639
This is it, this is everything.

13:48.679 --> 13:51.600
Right here, Frog Skull Island
overtime.

13:51.639 --> 13:54.120
This is for all
the fanny packs.

13:54.159 --> 13:56.879
Kevin Beverly,
if he makes this jump,

13:56.919 --> 13:58.360
he’s going on.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.519
He’s on!

14:02.559 --> 14:03.799
He advances, it’s over!

14:03.840 --> 14:06.399
Oh, that is so heart-breaking.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.559
Yeah!

14:09.679 --> 14:11.399
He fell off!

14:11.440 --> 14:13.840
[laughing]

14:13.879 --> 14:15.519
He celebrates because
he knows

14:15.559 --> 14:18.000
he is the victor, and
then the water cannon

14:18.039 --> 14:19.360
just shoots him off.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.960
An emphatic overtime victory.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.279
This was incredible.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.159
You don’t see better
"Frogger" than that.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.159
A battle for the ages,
and the best part is

14:30.200 --> 14:32.720
Kevin Beverly is still joining
us in the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

14:32.759 --> 14:34.519
We get more of KB.

14:34.559 --> 14:36.559
So what crossing is up next?

14:36.600 --> 14:39.159
Welcome to Candy Frog Land.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.279
Starting on the candy conveyor,

14:41.320 --> 14:43.279
Froggers must
remove the gumballs

14:43.320 --> 14:45.720
and take the jawbreakers
or the lilies

14:45.759 --> 14:47.720
to the candy cane monkey bars.

14:47.759 --> 14:49.559
Leaping between
the chocolate bars

14:49.600 --> 14:50.840
to the spinning S’mores,

14:50.879 --> 14:52.399
they’ll jump to the cupcake

14:52.440 --> 14:54.600
before a licorice
rope walk home.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.480
Next up it’s fitness
fanatic Brianna

14:58.519 --> 15:01.519
versus professional
wrestler, Bobby Orlando.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.200
I’m Brianna, I’m 28.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.399
I’m from San Diego, California,

15:05.440 --> 15:07.399
and I am a health
and fitness coach.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.000
I love to test myself
physically.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.279
I can deadlift 405 pounds,

15:12.320 --> 15:14.799
so I think I’m a little stronger
than even some of the guys.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.200
I may look glamorous,

15:17.240 --> 15:20.360
but I am strong and
you are going down.

15:20.399 --> 15:24.159
I am Bobby Orlando.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.240
I am a professional wrestler.

15:28.679 --> 15:33.000
People back home call
me the master of sick tricks.

15:33.039 --> 15:34.320
Sick trick!

15:34.360 --> 15:37.320
So as many sick tricks
I can do the better.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.759
Ba!

15:38.799 --> 15:40.440
Be afraid, be prepared.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.600
And be shook.

15:43.639 --> 15:46.120
So, at the end of this,
that’s where I’ll be

15:46.159 --> 15:49.240
and you’ll be somewhere...

15:49.279 --> 15:50.320
- I’ll be there, too.
- ...In the water.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.480
No, no, no, on, no, no, no.

15:51.519 --> 15:54.679
I’m staying dry.
I’m staying dry.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.399
They’re bringing it,
it’s already been "broughten".

15:57.440 --> 15:58.720
Woo!

15:58.759 --> 16:02.080
Think these two are our
most confident Froggers yet.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.200
Ready, Frogger 1?

16:03.240 --> 16:05.440
- Yep.
- Here we go.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.559
Good luck, you need it.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.440
San Diego’s own Briana Lamb.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.200
Welcome to the candy conveyor
on Candy Frog Land.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.720
Four gumballs before
she can advance.

16:14.759 --> 16:15.799
And it’s already tricky.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.480
This is hard.
Oh my God!

16:20.679 --> 16:22.039
The blue gumball is down.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.320
We’ve got three more.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.440
She’s already expended
a lot of energy.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.440
I like that jump, man.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.120
The jump is ferocious.

16:28.159 --> 16:30.320
There’s seven feet every
single time.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.799
Pink gumball.
Down.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.639
Not bad, yo.

16:35.679 --> 16:37.399
Woo!

16:37.440 --> 16:42.200
Now she’s got to get back to
the ominous jawbreaker.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.240
All right!
In position.

16:44.279 --> 16:46.039
Does she go jawbreaker?
She’s going to the lily pad!

16:46.080 --> 16:47.679
- She’s in!
- Oh!

16:47.720 --> 16:49.600
Down goes Brianna.

16:49.639 --> 16:50.960
Great effort, though.

16:52.759 --> 16:55.639
This is her 57th jump she’s
already done in this crossing.

16:55.679 --> 16:58.000
Those knees gave out.

16:58.039 --> 16:59.919
- Woo!
- They’re like, hey, I quit.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.080
Brianna goes splash.

17:03.039 --> 17:04.480
Bobby Orlando.

17:04.519 --> 17:05.559
You know it.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.440
- Ready, Frogger 2?
- Yes.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.640
- I was born ready.
- Here we go.

17:11.359 --> 17:14.000
He he comes, Mr. Bobby Orlando.

17:14.039 --> 17:16.319
Whoa!
That was a rough ring entrance

17:16.359 --> 17:18.319
for our semi-pro or-- Whoa!

17:18.359 --> 17:20.519
He just got smashed
by the watermelon.

17:20.559 --> 17:21.400
[laughing]

17:21.440 --> 17:23.200
She is laughing at him.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.000
All right, this ain’t
so bad, yo.

17:25.039 --> 17:27.200
This is easy work!

17:27.240 --> 17:29.400
He says this is easy work,
I don’t know, dude.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.200
He did that by accident.

17:31.240 --> 17:36.000
We got three gumballs down,
one left for Mr. Bobby Orlando.

17:36.039 --> 17:37.880
He says he’s the best
wrestler alive.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.680
This ain’t no joke, yo,
but Bobby Orlando’s got it!

17:40.720 --> 17:41.839
Oh, God.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.880
- Does he, though?
- The goatest!

17:43.920 --> 17:45.440
The goatest?
Oh, jeez.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.400
He almost died.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.200
He’s almost died
26 times.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.400
All right... one smooth jump.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.680
Jawbreaker,
do the jawbreaker.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.799
Here we go.

17:55.839 --> 17:57.200
And right on to
the lily pad.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.440
I didn’t think...
and he’s alive!

17:58.480 --> 17:59.680
Ah!

17:59.720 --> 18:03.559
Bobby is alive and well,
what a run we’ve got.

18:03.599 --> 18:05.400
Time to catch the breath.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.039
He might have shattered
his tailbone

18:08.079 --> 18:09.000
but he made it.

18:09.039 --> 18:10.680
I think he hurt
his coccyx.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.559
I would ask the doctor to
inspect it but I bet he’ll pass.

18:14.599 --> 18:15.359
And to the lily, okay.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.559
Ah!

18:16.599 --> 18:18.400
Jeez, he’s going to
slip on everything.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.559
If this guy can do
the body slam, the suplex

18:20.599 --> 18:21.920
the pile driver, certainly
he can do

18:21.960 --> 18:23.200
some candy cane monkey bars.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.599
Let’s go, pomade.
Come on.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.400
I mean, his shoes are made
out of banana peels.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.400
I know.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.839
Bobby’s slipped as
many times

18:28.880 --> 18:31.200
as Brianna jumped.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.759
All right, Bobby, let’s go.

18:32.799 --> 18:34.000
He said his name
was Orlando.

18:34.039 --> 18:35.480
But can he bloom?

18:35.519 --> 18:36.680
Hey!

18:36.720 --> 18:39.519
Here we go, he’s electing
to go uptown.

18:39.559 --> 18:41.519
Now get to the Kricket Krunches.
He’s on!

18:41.559 --> 18:42.519
Sick trick!

18:42.559 --> 18:45.079
- Come on, Bobby Orlando.
- Woo!

18:45.119 --> 18:46.440
I’m bringing it back
to 2011,

18:46.480 --> 18:48.400
we’re planking.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.160
All right!

18:50.200 --> 18:52.000
Bobby is now facing

18:52.039 --> 18:54.000
the Kricket Krunches.

18:54.039 --> 18:55.799
What are the ingredients
of a Kricket Krunch bar?

18:55.839 --> 18:57.799
Chocolate and crickets.

18:57.839 --> 18:59.000
- Oh.
- I heard a rumor

18:59.039 --> 19:00.400
that they rounded up
those crickets

19:00.440 --> 19:02.720
from the audience at one of
your comedy shows.

19:02.759 --> 19:04.279
Hey, man.

19:06.119 --> 19:09.519
Second Kricket Krunch bar
beckoning him.

19:09.559 --> 19:10.559
All right.

19:10.599 --> 19:12.119
This is when it seems
so easy, Wayans.

19:12.160 --> 19:15.480
Things have a tendency to
go AWOL and astray.

19:15.519 --> 19:18.039
This is the shot.
He’s going over the bar!

19:28.440 --> 19:30.279
- All right.
- Pro wrestle Bobby Orlando

19:30.319 --> 19:33.759
second Kricket Krunch bar.
beckoning him.

19:33.799 --> 19:37.240
This is the shot.
He’s going over the bar!

19:37.279 --> 19:38.680
Ah!

19:38.720 --> 19:39.960
And he’s done!

19:40.000 --> 19:42.279
What the hell was he thinking?

19:42.319 --> 19:44.400
Oh my gosh, we need
a replay like

19:44.440 --> 19:45.480
we’ve never needed one before

19:45.519 --> 19:47.279
because we’ve never seen this.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.319
This is a licorice bridge,
it’s almost always a de facto

19:49.359 --> 19:51.079
limbo stick,
you go underneath it.

19:51.119 --> 19:53.319
He decided to go
over the obstacle,

19:53.359 --> 19:56.079
- and almost pulled it off.
- He did.

19:56.119 --> 19:57.480
It was close.

19:57.519 --> 19:59.200
Ready, Frogger 1?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.480
Ready.

20:00.519 --> 20:01.559
Here we go.

20:01.599 --> 20:03.799
Briana Lamb came here
to do one thing:

20:03.839 --> 20:05.319
jump all over the course.

20:05.359 --> 20:08.079
We’ve never seen a Frogger
this frog-like

20:08.119 --> 20:10.119
Seven feet, every time
she makes a--

20:10.160 --> 20:13.359
Oh! She’s in! Good Lord,
that was a fatality.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.759
Oh my God!

20:14.799 --> 20:17.160
Oh my goodness.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.960
Let’s see that again.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.400
Briana Lamb.
Carve that Lamb

20:21.440 --> 20:22.759
and serve it with
some mint jelly.

20:22.799 --> 20:24.160
That Lamb is cooked.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.759
I think the Lamb is silenced.

20:25.799 --> 20:28.680
We have the official silence
of the Lambs.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.880
She’s got nothing to say.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.720
Get her a glass of chianti.

20:32.759 --> 20:34.319
[smacking lips]

20:34.359 --> 20:35.480
Yes!

20:35.519 --> 20:38.640
Bobby Orlando, you have
two lives left.

20:38.680 --> 20:39.880
Ah!

20:39.920 --> 20:41.599
Ah-oo!

20:41.640 --> 20:42.759
Ugh!

20:42.799 --> 20:44.599
- Ah!
- Yah!

20:44.640 --> 20:45.920
[laughing]

20:45.960 --> 20:48.079
I feel like Bobby would rather

20:48.119 --> 20:50.640
look good and lose
than look bad and win.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.079
[chuckles]
I agree.

20:52.119 --> 20:53.640
- He’s got that vibe going on.
- Yes.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.559
Life number two
for the pro wrestler.

20:55.599 --> 20:58.279
If he finishes this crossing,
Briana Lamb is eliminated.

20:58.319 --> 21:00.359
But he got nuts
at this stage of the crossing

21:00.400 --> 21:03.480
- last time around.
- Over the top!

21:03.519 --> 21:04.880
You know what, actually?

21:04.920 --> 21:06.200
Underneath might be easier.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.799
- [laughing]
- I don’t know!

21:07.839 --> 21:10.759
Just jump over it again,
give the people what they want.

21:10.799 --> 21:11.920
Over the top.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.759
This is the one,
he goes over again.

21:13.799 --> 21:16.240
- And lands...
- No!

21:16.279 --> 21:17.960
Are you kidding me?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.319
Oh no.

21:19.359 --> 21:21.279
Into the water
like Augustus Gloop.

21:21.319 --> 21:24.400
Way to learn your lesson,
Bobby Orlando.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.079
He has been downgraded
now to Bobby Jacksonville.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.799
Unfortunately,
he’s got a new name.

21:28.839 --> 21:31.680
After that it’s going
to have to be Bobby Tampa.

21:31.720 --> 21:32.759
Maybe, I don’t know where
we go from there.

21:32.799 --> 21:35.039
Yeah.

21:35.079 --> 21:36.839
Two foot release, that’s fine.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.839
Perfectly clears
the licorice bridge,

21:38.880 --> 21:40.119
and then take us through this.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.039
Gravity takes over
and says,

21:42.079 --> 21:44.880
hey, Bobby, I heard
you wrestle.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.440
Let me show you
who’s boss.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.200
I don’t know what Bobby’s
wrestling record is,

21:48.240 --> 21:50.920
but gravity’s is undefeated.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.319
Brianna, this is
your final life.

21:54.359 --> 21:55.519
Here we go.

21:55.559 --> 21:58.079
Briana Lamb on
the candy conveyor.

21:58.119 --> 21:59.599
You want to go the route
of the jawbreaker,

21:59.640 --> 22:01.440
or the slightly safer lily pad.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.799
She comes up short,
Bobby Orlando will advance.

22:04.839 --> 22:06.680
Here we go, and here’s the jump.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.039
- Oh no.
- What the?

22:09.079 --> 22:10.480
Woo-hoo!

22:10.519 --> 22:12.079
That is it,
she just didn’t have it.

22:12.119 --> 22:13.880
Wow, man.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.359
Spectacularly right
into the water.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.559
As they say in Jersey,
sleeping with the fishes.

22:19.599 --> 22:20.680
Hey, yo.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.880
A hell of an effort,

22:21.920 --> 22:23.880
but well short
of Bobby Orlando.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.000
Patting myself on the back.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.480
I’ve got news
for you Wayans.

22:26.519 --> 22:29.640
Bobby Orlando is going to
the Boss Toad Bobby Round,

22:29.680 --> 22:30.920
we’re calling it.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.519
What do the kids say?
Bobby is "extra."

22:32.559 --> 22:33.960
Isn’t that what
they say these days?

22:34.000 --> 22:38.079
Bobby Orlando is
a ridiculous human being.

22:41.039 --> 22:44.119
We are rolling,
rolling, rolling

22:44.160 --> 22:46.160
down Ribbit River.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.039
Froggers must pass
the powerful jets

22:49.079 --> 22:50.720
of the waterfall,
then call for the turtles,

22:50.759 --> 22:52.680
and jump a ride to the logs,

22:52.720 --> 22:55.160
or take a tough shortcut
through the spinning lilies.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.480
Once they’ve traversed
the up and down loco lilies,

22:57.519 --> 23:00.279
Froggers ride the gators
and scale the rocks

23:00.319 --> 23:02.720
before swinging home
to the landing pad.

23:02.759 --> 23:06.440
Next up, it’s person trainer
Jaimar Brown

23:06.480 --> 23:10.240
versus punk rocker
David Christopher.

23:10.279 --> 23:12.759
My name is Jaimar,
I am 29.

23:12.799 --> 23:14.440
I’m from Boston, Massachusetts,

23:14.480 --> 23:16.759
and I am a fitness instructor,
a personal trainer,

23:16.799 --> 23:18.440
and a fitness influencer.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.119
I was going through
a little breakup,

23:20.160 --> 23:22.079
I was like,
let’s get it together.

23:22.119 --> 23:24.279
Revenge body.
Let’s do it.

23:24.319 --> 23:27.079
Ah!

23:27.119 --> 23:29.240
All of these skills
that I’ve learned

23:29.279 --> 23:32.240
through my fitness journey,
I’m going to use it here

23:32.279 --> 23:33.960
to take the prize.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.319
Who’s winning now?

23:38.480 --> 23:39.519
My name is David.

23:39.559 --> 23:40.839
I’m from Los Angeles,
California,

23:40.880 --> 23:42.480
I’m 34 years old.

23:42.519 --> 23:47.079
My nickname is Punk Rock,
because I am punk rock.

23:47.119 --> 23:48.759
"Frogger" enthusiast,

23:48.799 --> 23:50.680
there’s no such thing
as competition here.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.279
I’m not worried about it.

23:52.319 --> 23:54.920
I’m going to take home
that money.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.839
Ready, Frogger 1?

23:58.880 --> 24:00.279
Let’s go!

24:00.319 --> 24:03.720
29 year old Jaimar Brown,
Boston, Massachusetts.

24:03.759 --> 24:05.359
He wants that Golden Fanny Pack.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.960
He says he works out
three hours a day.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.200
Wow.

24:09.240 --> 24:09.880
This is why you do it.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.119
See the results.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.319
Thank you for
the desert, cameraman.

24:15.119 --> 24:16.680
You got this.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.000
Oh, here we go.
Whoa!

24:20.039 --> 24:21.680
- Are you...
- There’s your flex!

24:21.720 --> 24:22.680
...kidding me?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.799
- Wow!
- Yeah!

24:24.839 --> 24:27.039
Take a moment, pose.

24:27.079 --> 24:28.440
Damn it, I hate that
you made that.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.000
But good job, man.

24:30.039 --> 24:32.319
Go, JJ, go JJ, go!

24:32.359 --> 24:33.799
Wow, JJ!

24:33.839 --> 24:35.039
Now was that his mating call?

24:35.079 --> 24:37.000
A self-congratulatory
mating call?

24:37.039 --> 24:38.440
- I don’t mind it.
- It worked.

24:38.480 --> 24:41.799
Little Rock welcomes
the flexing Jaimar Brown.

24:41.839 --> 24:43.200
Woo!

24:43.240 --> 24:44.720
Make a choice, come on.

24:44.759 --> 24:46.440
And he’s off!

24:46.480 --> 24:47.960
Tony the Turtle.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.400
Uh-oh.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.240
Wait, what?

24:50.279 --> 24:52.000
Come on, Mr. Muscles.

24:52.039 --> 24:53.720
Don’t slip, don’t slip.

24:53.759 --> 24:54.680
[grunts]

24:54.720 --> 24:55.680
Miraculous!

24:55.720 --> 24:56.720
The power.

24:56.759 --> 24:58.599
This is Jaimar’s revenge bod,

24:58.640 --> 25:01.119
what the hell did
his ex do to him?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.599
Ribbit.
Ribbit.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.359
Remember, he’s got
a choice here.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.519
He could go for the silly lily,
that spinning one,

25:07.559 --> 25:09.319
which is
actually a quicker route,

25:09.359 --> 25:11.160
or he goes to the rope
and the set of logs

25:13.480 --> 25:14.799
Oh, we’re going rope here.

25:14.839 --> 25:17.400
Okay, we got action.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.160
Let go!

25:18.200 --> 25:20.039
Look at the bicep flex.

25:20.079 --> 25:21.319
This is why
he’s doing this.

25:21.359 --> 25:23.359
I didn’t realize how
difficult it is

25:23.400 --> 25:24.960
to get to Tommy from Tony.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.759
We don’t see many
Froggers do it,

25:26.799 --> 25:28.440
and it is deceptively hard.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.279
Ah!

25:29.319 --> 25:30.519
Oh, he’s getting wet now.

25:30.559 --> 25:31.640
Now the shoes are wet.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.119
Terrible form.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.440
Amazing strength.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.599
Oh!

25:44.000 --> 25:46.359
He’s on the rope and he’s going
the conventional path.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.359
But this is tough, now,
because you get caught

25:48.400 --> 25:49.960
in no man’s land,
where is he going next?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.759
Oh!
Okay.

25:51.799 --> 25:54.480
All right, here we go,
let’s go Mr. Atlas.

25:54.519 --> 25:57.160
Is he strategizing
or just posing?

25:57.200 --> 25:59.920
The finger hold,
get the leg up.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.759
All right!

26:01.799 --> 26:03.799
Great job, great strength!

26:03.839 --> 26:04.960
Woo!

26:05.000 --> 26:07.480
Next up, that lazy logs.

26:07.519 --> 26:09.559
These lazy logs may
loo easy as

26:09.599 --> 26:13.079
14 foot targets,
but don’t be fooled.

26:13.119 --> 26:14.720
Their narrow,
uneven surfaces

26:14.759 --> 26:17.599
will have Froggers
swimming in no time.

26:17.640 --> 26:18.839
Huge lead he’s opening.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.519
Straight flexing
on Ribbit River.

26:20.559 --> 26:21.599
And he’s off!

26:21.640 --> 26:23.240
Oh boy.

26:23.279 --> 26:24.920
And now we’ve got a battle.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.119
Mr. Muscleman, dig deep now.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.119
Think of all that protein.
Think of all those reps.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.279
Pull yourself up.

26:30.319 --> 26:32.079
Dude, he down.
He’s gone!

26:32.119 --> 26:33.759
My feet are not
in the water!

26:33.799 --> 26:35.160
No way, dude,
no way.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.240
We got a grip, can he hold on?

26:37.279 --> 26:39.960
He’s down!

26:40.000 --> 26:41.480
So many Froggers go
to that little knot.

26:41.519 --> 26:43.079
I think we’re calling
it Knot’s Landing.

26:43.119 --> 26:44.279
It’s right where they land,

26:44.319 --> 26:45.880
rarely do they
pull themselves out.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.119
If this guy can’t do it,

26:47.160 --> 26:48.839
you know it’s tough
for the others.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.480
Who has a muscle
on their elbow?

26:50.519 --> 26:52.279
Ready, Frogger 2?

26:52.319 --> 26:55.559
- Ready.
- Here we go.

26:55.599 --> 26:57.920
David Christopher embarks
upon Ribbit River.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.359
Let’s rock!

26:59.400 --> 27:04.359
5’ 9", 160, 34 years old.
Los Angeles, California.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.599
Very physically fit.
these two Froggers, Wayans.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.799
Here he goes.

27:07.839 --> 27:09.119
It’s just water, come on,
you got this.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.119
What is this?

27:11.160 --> 27:12.640
[laughing]

27:12.680 --> 27:14.319
He’s mounting the thing.

27:14.359 --> 27:16.119
Taking it bidet style.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.359
David, you want to get
your colon cleansed?

27:17.400 --> 27:19.359
I’m gonna clean mine.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.279
He’s taking heavy punishment.

27:21.319 --> 27:23.400
All right, face first.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.079
Look at the strength
he still has.

27:25.119 --> 27:26.079
He got the rope!

27:26.119 --> 27:27.759
Go dry land... got it

27:27.799 --> 27:29.359
That’s what you’re
supposed to do.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.440
- Absolutely beautiful.
- That’s how you play.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.119
Hey, froggies!

27:34.160 --> 27:36.839
Froggy froggy froggy froggy!

27:36.880 --> 27:38.799
Literally not a frog.

27:38.839 --> 27:40.160
Froggy!

27:40.200 --> 27:41.759
Froggy, froggy, froggy,
that’s what he said

27:41.799 --> 27:43.200
to the hard shelled turtle.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.000
Got it!

27:47.039 --> 27:48.000
- Okay
- Wow.

27:48.039 --> 27:49.680
That was a great landing.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.839
Okay.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.000
He advances again.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.359
We have a competition now.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.119
If he can get to this log,
he takes the lead.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.440
Look how he’s not spinning.

27:59.480 --> 28:00.960
What a rock star thing
to take the record

28:01.000 --> 28:02.200
and put it backwards.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.839
The hidden messages,
and here he goes.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.240
And he’s holding on!

28:05.279 --> 28:06.960
He’s alive!

28:07.000 --> 28:08.240
Come on, Punk Rock.

28:08.279 --> 28:09.480
Get up there.

28:09.519 --> 28:12.200
Okay, upper body strength,
come on.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.759
The name of his band
is Against All Odds.

28:14.799 --> 28:17.119
And that is what
he’s looking at right now.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.359
You can let go now,
it’s all good.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.160
We’ve seen many attempts

28:20.200 --> 28:23.160
on this log before, nobody has
ever succeeded.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.680
This guy battles, Wayans.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.000
We love guys who battle!

28:26.039 --> 28:27.279
True warrior, man.

28:27.319 --> 28:29.279
Oh my gosh, we might get it.

28:29.319 --> 28:31.519
- Oh...
- If he gets on top of

28:31.559 --> 28:32.400
this log, Wayans,
we’re going to lose our minds.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.640
Come on, David.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.880
Pull up, pull up!

28:35.920 --> 28:36.759
Come on!

28:36.799 --> 28:38.400
Yeah!

28:38.440 --> 28:40.079
Woo!

28:40.119 --> 28:42.240
- It was all worth it!
- He did it!

28:42.279 --> 28:44.000
I feel like we’ve
already run a marathon.

28:44.039 --> 28:46.160
I just peed a little bit.
I did.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.359
- Damon has wet his pants.
- I peed.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.759
I peed a little bit.

28:48.799 --> 28:51.480
This is a six foot jump
to the lily pad stationary.

28:51.519 --> 28:52.759
And he is strong,
and here he goes.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.200
- Wayans, he is up.
- Wow.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.000
This is unbelievable to watch.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.200
Unbelievable.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.400
So now he is on
the loco lilies,

29:00.440 --> 29:02.359
which go up and down
up to eight feet off

29:02.400 --> 29:03.799
the surface of the river.

29:03.839 --> 29:05.480
- Beautiful.
- Wow.

29:05.519 --> 29:07.720
That’s the first lily,
now there’s eight feet across.

29:07.759 --> 29:09.359
Eight feet of elevation,

29:09.400 --> 29:10.960
and there’s that change
of direction.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.079
How the hell am I
going to do that?

29:12.119 --> 29:14.119
This is big.
David’s on fire

29:14.160 --> 29:17.279
And I don’t mean
like Jimi Hendrix.

29:17.319 --> 29:19.279
Oh man!

29:19.319 --> 29:21.440
- Oh, man is right.
- Slipped.

29:21.480 --> 29:25.279
The stage dive with no fans
there for the rock star.

29:25.319 --> 29:27.799
That’s an unfortunate ending.

29:27.839 --> 29:30.599
Ready, Frogger 2?

29:30.640 --> 29:32.279
Here we go.

29:32.319 --> 29:33.039
He’s flexing already.

29:33.079 --> 29:34.920
Let’s go, J!

29:34.960 --> 29:36.160
You got this, brother,
come on!

29:40.000 --> 29:42.440
That’s not gonna work, Jaimar.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.839
Jaimar is going to have
to solve this log problem.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.400
He’s really struggling,
even with his immense strength.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.599
Oh no, he’s down.

29:51.640 --> 29:54.359
Down goes Jaimar,

29:54.400 --> 29:56.359
and David maintains the lead.

29:56.400 --> 29:59.240
The muscle guys,
they look great.

29:59.279 --> 30:01.279
- Yeah.
- It’s not necessarily

30:01.319 --> 30:02.880
a ticket to winning
in "Frogger".

30:02.920 --> 30:05.759
The crowd begging
for more David.

30:05.799 --> 30:07.039
Encore, encore.

30:07.079 --> 30:08.960
The lights come down
and he is back out.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.240
Let’s see how he does here.

30:10.279 --> 30:11.640
Oh, he looks focused,
I like it.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.960
This could be a moment
right here, Wayans.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.079
This is the jump
of his life.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.680
- Oh, another fight.
- Oh, wow!

30:19.720 --> 30:20.640
Ring the bell!

30:20.680 --> 30:22.079
Come on, David.

30:22.119 --> 30:23.440
That’s his entire body weight.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.079
Not only that but he has
a bunch of

30:26.119 --> 30:28.359
shrubbery on him.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.119
Let’s go, let’s go,
fight for it!

30:30.160 --> 30:31.359
Fight for it!

30:31.400 --> 30:33.960
Look at this guy,
what is that?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.160
He’s trying to use it.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.720
We got a shot here.

30:36.759 --> 30:40.200
Never have I seen this
in all our time here on Frogger.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.440
Are you kidding me?

30:41.480 --> 30:43.960
Cannot believe
he’s doing this.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.759
He’s right back in the octagon.

30:45.799 --> 30:48.720
Can he win another
ground and pound?

30:48.759 --> 30:49.839
Ah!

30:49.880 --> 30:51.559
Oh, and he’s down!

30:51.599 --> 30:53.960
David Christopher,
what a battle.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.039
I love this dude.
I’m a fan.

30:55.079 --> 30:57.039
Wow, what perseverance.

30:57.079 --> 30:58.839
I love that.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.960
Jaimar Brown has one life left.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.680
He just hasn’t mastered
the jump yet.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.319
I still feel like
he’s not decided

31:06.359 --> 31:07.640
which log he’s going for even.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.160
He’s tried both.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.559
Which one will he jump on?

31:10.599 --> 31:12.240
Let’s find out.

31:12.279 --> 31:13.759
Make a move J, come on!

31:13.799 --> 31:15.240
Here we go...

31:15.279 --> 31:17.599
Oh, that was a quick one.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.680
Yeah!

31:18.720 --> 31:21.000
Let’s go, Boss Toad!
Bring it on!

31:21.039 --> 31:22.640
Punk Rock, baby!

31:22.680 --> 31:25.160
David Christopher,
the rock star

31:25.200 --> 31:28.720
is going to our rock star
named Boss Toad.

31:28.759 --> 31:30.960
The question remains:
who’s going to take home

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
that Golden Fanny Pack?

31:32.039 --> 31:33.599
Let’s find out.

31:45.359 --> 31:49.079
He knows 23 languages.

31:49.119 --> 31:52.440
Yet speaks none of them.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.839
He dabbles in black magic,
and juggling.

31:56.880 --> 32:02.640
He was once bullied by a gang
of crazed mosquitos.

32:02.680 --> 32:06.559
He is Boss Toad.

32:09.279 --> 32:11.839
And now it’s time for
our final Froggers

32:11.880 --> 32:14.839
to match wits with Boss Toad.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.839
Guess what the hardest part
of the that will be?

32:16.880 --> 32:17.839
What’s that?

32:17.880 --> 32:19.039
Finding Boss Toad’s wit.

32:19.079 --> 32:20.440
[laughing]

32:20.480 --> 32:22.599
Not hard to find him, though.
He’s stinks!

32:22.640 --> 32:23.799
[belches]

32:23.839 --> 32:26.640
Boss Toad has frognapped
five froglets

32:26.680 --> 32:29.440
and hidden them across the most
challenging crossing

32:29.480 --> 32:32.519
of them all,
Boss Toad’s Temple.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.559
Our Froggers each get
five minutes to rescue

32:34.599 --> 32:37.240
those froglets, as many
as they can,

32:37.279 --> 32:38.799
and they can choose
any route they want

32:38.839 --> 32:40.480
to get the job done.

32:40.519 --> 32:42.079
But they only have
one life,

32:42.119 --> 32:44.200
so if they fall in,
game over.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.400
Tonight’s winner takes home
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.839
He’ll also go on to
compete in the ultimate

32:51.880 --> 32:54.599
Frogger championship and
the chance to take home

32:54.640 --> 32:57.839
- a cool $100,000.
- Woo!

32:57.880 --> 33:02.599
Taking of Boss Toad temple
we have Kevin Beverly,

33:02.640 --> 33:05.799
the first to ever cross
Frog Skull Island.

33:05.839 --> 33:09.279
Winner in the battle of
the bands, David Christopher.

33:09.319 --> 33:13.720
But first, pro wrestling’s
Bobby Orlando.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.440
Ready, Frogger?

33:16.480 --> 33:17.920
Yo, Bobby’s ready.

33:17.960 --> 33:18.960
[laughing]

33:19.000 --> 33:20.839
Boss Toad!

33:20.880 --> 33:24.160
Bobby Orlando challenging
Boss Toad.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.440
It’s a bold strategy, Wayans,

33:25.480 --> 33:26.480
let’s see how it
plays out for him.

33:26.519 --> 33:29.359
His own private
Froggermania

33:29.400 --> 33:31.319
as he steps into the ring.

33:31.359 --> 33:33.279
Rock and circus await.

33:33.319 --> 33:35.680
This match is scheduled
for one fall.

33:37.839 --> 33:40.039
All right, he’s going to
the proximate one first.

33:40.079 --> 33:43.000
That quick baby froglet
right there, Wayans.

33:43.039 --> 33:45.039
I like it.
I like this play.

33:45.079 --> 33:47.039
Froglet number one.

33:47.079 --> 33:48.599
Bobby looking to get
on the board.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.000
Is he going to make the jump
with the froglet?

33:51.039 --> 33:53.720
And he will and he’s got it.

33:53.759 --> 33:56.279
Ha!
There we go!

33:56.319 --> 33:59.359
We’ve got on froglet banked,
five possible.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.759
They are surrounded
all across Boss Toad temple.

34:01.799 --> 34:04.359
Remember, if he falls
into the water, it’s over.

34:05.359 --> 34:06.640
- Oh!
- Whoa!

34:06.680 --> 34:07.599
He almost had it.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.679
Good save.

34:08.719 --> 34:09.599
Wow.

34:09.639 --> 34:11.239
Good job, Bobby,
good job.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.679
He’s going to go to
Harriet the hippo.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.800
Here we go.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.000
Ah!

34:17.039 --> 34:18.320
Oh, man.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.320
You are wasting time,
my friend!

34:20.360 --> 34:24.039
Harriet the hippos rotations are
exactly 12.5 seconds,

34:24.079 --> 34:25.280
which is what he just burned

34:25.320 --> 34:27.679
letting her go for
another rotation.

34:27.719 --> 34:29.719
This is a very important
jump here.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.639
Ha!

34:31.679 --> 34:32.679
Oh, he’s in!

34:32.719 --> 34:34.239
Bobby is down,
they hooked the leg.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.800
Three count, he’s out.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.880
[bell dings]

34:36.920 --> 34:38.079
He got a froglet on the board.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.199
Let’s give him that.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.039
- He got one.
- He got one.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.480
With David and Kev Bev waiting,

34:43.519 --> 34:45.840
they’re so talented, I just
can’t see one holding up.

34:45.880 --> 34:49.039
David Christopher,
this is your solo, my friend.

34:49.079 --> 34:50.719
Let’s rock.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.840
Going right to that closest
froglet in the incisors

34:53.880 --> 34:55.840
of the Venus frog trap.

34:55.880 --> 34:56.800
Great technique.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.000
That was a big jump right there.

34:58.039 --> 34:59.039
Don’t underestimate it.

34:59.079 --> 35:00.800
Oh, a little messy.

35:00.840 --> 35:03.440
Now, does he reach for it
like we saw Bobby Orlando do?

35:03.480 --> 35:04.960
That’s the smartest play.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.800
He’s a little shorter,
so I think he’s going

35:06.840 --> 35:08.320
to have to get inside.
- Absolutely, he’s only 5’9".

35:08.360 --> 35:10.840
He’s got a split position.
Careful now.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.960
Oh, God!

35:13.000 --> 35:14.239
Froglet secured.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.840
I believe he’s going
to jump with it.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.400
An aerial move for the lead
guitarist, David Christopher.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.599
And he’s got it.

35:22.559 --> 35:24.639
Now he’s got one in,
is it fast enough

35:24.679 --> 35:26.280
to beat Bobby Orlando?

35:26.320 --> 35:27.480
- Oh!
- Ah!

35:27.519 --> 35:29.039
He’s not taking
any chances here.

35:29.079 --> 35:31.079
He’s approaching Harriet.

35:31.119 --> 35:32.119
This is for Bobby!

35:32.159 --> 35:33.360
Thank you, David!

35:33.400 --> 35:35.320
If he gets two,
he’s good.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.079
Got to nail it here, though.

35:38.119 --> 35:39.519
Oh my God, he got it!

35:39.559 --> 35:41.800
Clock is ticking
over a minute.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.039
Off of Harriet.

35:43.079 --> 35:44.480
Oh, the rocker is rolling.

35:44.519 --> 35:46.039
Does he go for
the big stage?

35:46.079 --> 35:48.760
No, he wants that helicopter
ride.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.280
Boss Toad, ugly as sin.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.760
He reeks of swamp sewage.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.239
He stank.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.280
He gets to the helipad,
a second froglet.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.440
How should he tuck it, Wayans?

35:57.480 --> 35:59.559
- Right between the legs.
- Bam!

35:59.599 --> 36:02.119
And here comes
Hopper Chopper 1000.

36:02.159 --> 36:03.719
Woo!

36:03.760 --> 36:05.440
What’s up baby?

36:05.480 --> 36:06.880
How’s the dismount?

36:06.920 --> 36:08.039
Holy crap is this high.

36:08.079 --> 36:09.280
Woo!

36:09.320 --> 36:10.920
What a rock star!

36:10.960 --> 36:12.880
Gets that second froglet down.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.840
And Bobby Orlando is done.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.239
[imitates guitar solo]

36:16.280 --> 36:18.239
The rock star is in first place

36:18.280 --> 36:20.079
with the circus performer
yet to go..

36:20.119 --> 36:21.239
Oh!

36:21.280 --> 36:23.159
He scorpioned on
that lily pad.

36:23.199 --> 36:24.960
Rocked it like a hurricane.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.639
And he is alive.

36:26.679 --> 36:29.559
Time’s ticking, he’s almost
to the two minute mark, Wayans.

36:29.599 --> 36:31.159
He’s going to the pyramid,
he’s going to the pyramid.

36:31.199 --> 36:33.280
Here we go, Toad temple awaits!

36:33.320 --> 36:35.199
I love this play,
it’s dangerous.

36:35.239 --> 36:36.840
- But he gets two if he does it!
- Absolutely.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.599
At this point of the course,
banking two more froglets

36:39.639 --> 36:41.000
is huge.

36:41.039 --> 36:43.639
He’s very athletic, but this
is where fatigue comes.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.039
We’ve seen Froggers fall
at this very spot.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.239
This is a big jump.

36:48.280 --> 36:51.519
David is going to the temple,
he’s going double or nothing.

36:51.559 --> 36:54.079
He need these two Froggers
to secure his lead.

36:56.199 --> 36:58.039
No!

36:58.079 --> 36:59.280
Down he goes!

36:59.320 --> 37:01.800
Exit stage left.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.840
That is the set, no encore.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.119
One life only.

37:05.159 --> 37:07.320
[Boss Toad laughs]

37:07.360 --> 37:09.400
[imitates guitar]

37:09.440 --> 37:10.239
Doing a little
air guitar, right?

37:10.280 --> 37:11.679
But like a sad one.

37:11.719 --> 37:13.159
[imitates guitar]

37:13.199 --> 37:13.960
Yeah, this is more
of the blues.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.199
Yeah.

37:15.239 --> 37:16.920
Two froglets on the board
for David.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.760
Any he did it
pretty quickly.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.559
It is time for
our final Frogger.

37:21.599 --> 37:23.360
Kevin Beverly.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.159
Cirque du Soleil on his resume.

37:25.199 --> 37:27.480
Can he beat two froglets
and take home

37:27.519 --> 37:30.480
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack?

37:30.519 --> 37:32.559
It all comes down to this.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.440
It is time for our final
Frogger, Kevin Beverly.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.159
Can he beat two froglets
and take home

37:49.199 --> 37:51.239
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack?

37:51.280 --> 37:52.440
Let’s find out.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.039
I’m getting excited.

37:54.079 --> 37:57.519
Bam, all right, casual, easy
jump on to Harriet the hippo.

37:57.559 --> 37:59.519
This gentleman
is in control

37:59.559 --> 38:00.920
and I’ve got a feeling
he’s headed for

38:00.960 --> 38:01.880
the Hopper Chopper, Wayans.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.280
Lily pad, no problem.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.719
Here’s the point of decision,
and you know it.

38:05.760 --> 38:06.880
Fire up the chopper.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.119
He’s got speed.

38:08.159 --> 38:09.360
Pace is great.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.760
Perfect form.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.000
Kevin Beverly has
got the froglet,

38:13.039 --> 38:14.960
takes it out of his
little burlap diaper.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.480
We are off and he is
flying, Wayans. So fast.

38:18.519 --> 38:20.159
Not, at the 30 second mark.

38:20.199 --> 38:21.440
Oh, that was beautiful.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.559
Stunt on him, Kevin.

38:22.599 --> 38:24.159
This guy’s from the Matrix!

38:26.599 --> 38:28.039
He’s going for
the second froglet.

38:28.079 --> 38:29.840
Not wasting any time.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.360
Oh my God, he is already
back with the froglet.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.000
Boom, that was fast!

38:34.039 --> 38:35.119
Oh my gosh.

38:35.159 --> 38:36.119
I believe that was
under a minute.

38:36.159 --> 38:37.119
Under a minute.

38:37.159 --> 38:38.440
Bam, two froglets in.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.519
Wayans, Kevin Beverly is
here for five froglets.

38:41.559 --> 38:42.679
And he’s going turtle.

38:42.719 --> 38:44.119
Interesting.

38:44.159 --> 38:46.320
The turtle jump is treacherous,
you have to first go gator

38:46.360 --> 38:47.599
and then spinning turtle.

38:47.639 --> 38:49.920
This is a five foot jump
followed by a six.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.039
Now look to the right.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.719
This guy is doing
what I love.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.119
Guys, we’re seeing
a champion right here.

38:55.159 --> 38:56.599
Oh, this is fantabulous.

38:56.639 --> 38:57.199
Is that a word?

38:57.239 --> 38:58.039
Yeah, it is now.

38:58.079 --> 38:59.599
Okay.

38:59.639 --> 39:00.519
I feel like the rest of the
Froggers are in slow motion

39:00.559 --> 39:01.960
compared to Kevin Beverly.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.679
Oh my gosh, he just jumped
in there like a ninja!

39:03.719 --> 39:06.719
Look at this, just hop-scotching
through Boss Toad temple.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.000
Look at this guy go!

39:08.039 --> 39:09.519
It’s like magic.

39:09.559 --> 39:10.639
Oh!

39:10.679 --> 39:11.920
Don’t you kiposh them, Wayans!

39:11.960 --> 39:14.719
How dare you!

39:14.760 --> 39:17.079
Kevin Beverly back on
Gilligreen’s Island.

39:17.119 --> 39:20.079
And he has got it, that is
froglet number three.

39:20.119 --> 39:21.400
He wins, Wayans.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.519
All right, he’s looking
to make a statement here

39:24.559 --> 39:27.039
by getting all five froglets.

39:27.079 --> 39:29.320
Only the legendary
Jazzy Longlegs

39:29.360 --> 39:30.760
has achieved perfection before.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.840
Can Kevin set
a new high score?

39:32.880 --> 39:34.400
Let’s go.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.360
Look at this guy go!

39:35.400 --> 39:36.320
He’s not stopping!

39:36.360 --> 39:38.039
He is surfing on Harriet.

39:38.079 --> 39:39.679
The balance is exceptional.

39:39.719 --> 39:41.360
Two more out there,
and he wants them all.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.559
This is beautiful.

39:42.599 --> 39:44.119
- Woo!
- This is one of the greats.

39:44.159 --> 39:45.760
Oh man!

39:45.800 --> 39:47.599
He got blasted.

39:47.639 --> 39:49.280
He almost seemed
a little rattled.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.920
But he is playing to win.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.119
Let’s see if he can
tackle the temple.

39:53.159 --> 39:55.639
Kevin Beverly, you know he can.

39:55.679 --> 39:58.440
* I love everything
you’re doing Kevin *

39:58.480 --> 40:01.119
He’s got it, the parental
instincts kicking in.

40:01.159 --> 40:02.639
Keeping that froglet safe.

40:04.239 --> 40:06.480
And there’s five.

40:06.519 --> 40:07.559
He’s got a lot of
time Damon.

40:07.599 --> 40:08.800
He may go and
try to find six.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.320
It’s not out there,
but he may look.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.400
Here we go!
I love it.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.679
And look out on your six,
here it comes!

40:14.719 --> 40:15.880
Boom!

40:15.920 --> 40:18.519
Dodges that thing like a young
Indiana Jones.

40:18.559 --> 40:20.400
Damon, he’s going to
double dunk this finish.

40:20.440 --> 40:22.519
This is the Black Swan
he’s dancing.

40:22.559 --> 40:25.159
Last jump remaining,
hours on the clock.

40:25.199 --> 40:28.400
Oh!

40:28.440 --> 40:31.920
Kevin Beverly!
You are beautiful!

40:31.960 --> 40:33.360
- Five for five
- Yeah!

40:33.400 --> 40:35.880
This is a legend.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.119
Wow, what a statement!

40:38.159 --> 40:41.719
The circus performer
goes goat!

40:41.760 --> 40:43.239
- Whoo!
- Wow!

40:43.280 --> 40:44.639
And a backflip!

40:44.679 --> 40:46.119
Put this guy
in the Olympics.

40:46.159 --> 40:46.880
I want him in.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.519
Dear Olympics,

40:48.559 --> 40:50.440
Kevin.

40:51.840 --> 40:55.239
Congratulations to the planet’s
greatest athlete, Kevin,

40:55.280 --> 40:58.320
who just destroyed
Boss Toad Bonus Round.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.519
Collecting all five froglets,

41:00.559 --> 41:03.119
and doing it in seemingly
ten seconds.

41:03.159 --> 41:04.880
Someone may get five,

41:04.920 --> 41:08.039
but they have to get it
with a lunar cycle

41:08.079 --> 41:09.360
left over on the clock.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.000
$100,000, I’m coming for you.

41:12.039 --> 41:13.960
All right, let’s do it.
