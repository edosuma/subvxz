Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.358
Cami: Right now, people
like me are out there

00:04.388 --> 00:06.359
getting killed, conveniently timed

00:06.389 --> 00:08.828
with the arrival of your old acquaintance.

00:08.858 --> 00:10.546
(Lucien gasps)

00:10.576 --> 00:12.348
Cami: He's the first
person you ever turned.

00:12.378 --> 00:14.044
He's the first of your sire line.

00:14.046 --> 00:15.412
Elijah: So you say that you're in conflict

00:15.414 --> 00:16.641
with those of my sire line.

00:16.671 --> 00:19.183
Am I to assume that the
lord Tristan de Martel

00:19.185 --> 00:20.818
is up to his usual tricks?

00:20.820 --> 00:22.408
Lucien: This is no quarrel, Elijah.

00:22.438 --> 00:23.771
We are on the brink of war.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.272
Tristan knows that if he kills Klaus,

00:25.274 --> 00:27.179
he will eliminate all his enemies.

00:27.209 --> 00:29.515
Freya: If this prophecy is fulfilled.

00:29.545 --> 00:31.979
You will all fall... one by friend,

00:31.981 --> 00:35.048
one by foe, and one by family.

00:35.050 --> 00:39.386
Klaus: The lady Aurora, she is exquisite.

00:39.388 --> 00:41.169
I'll be in New Orleans shortly.

00:41.199 --> 00:44.408
Don't start the party without me.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.245
Klaus, voice-over: I never
meant for you to know me.

01:08.350 --> 01:10.901
I never meant to let you in...

01:16.341 --> 01:19.042
But then I should not have kissed you...

01:21.180 --> 01:24.014
Not the first time...

01:28.854 --> 01:31.421
Certainly not the second...

01:32.991 --> 01:35.559
But there is a light in you so bright,

01:35.561 --> 01:38.028
it makes me feel like
the man I wish I was...

01:40.766 --> 01:43.934
And forget the thing I am.

01:43.936 --> 01:46.881
I am chained to certain hungers

01:46.911 --> 01:49.739
and have damned another to my fate.

01:52.077 --> 01:54.377
You have seen what we do...

01:54.379 --> 01:59.182
we hunt, we feed, we kill...

01:59.184 --> 02:01.885
Aah!

02:01.887 --> 02:04.960
Klaus, voice-over: But what I am
I cannot answer...

02:04.990 --> 02:07.313
my family are the first;

02:07.343 --> 02:10.077
there is no name for it...

02:10.079 --> 02:12.346
(Sobbing)

02:13.716 --> 02:18.752
But I also desire deeply...

02:22.324 --> 02:27.261
And I can love, as I love you.

02:27.263 --> 02:29.563
Aurora: It was the most beautiful letter

02:29.565 --> 02:32.900
I'd ever received,

02:32.902 --> 02:36.103
and I did love him

02:36.105 --> 02:38.171
with all of my heart...

02:41.365 --> 02:42.613
But then eventually, our love,

02:42.643 --> 02:46.246
like the letter, crumbled to dust.

02:46.248 --> 02:48.282
(Sighs)

02:48.284 --> 02:50.617
Deliver this, will you,

02:50.619 --> 02:53.453
with my special instruction?

02:56.137 --> 02:58.225
So my first sire wants to kill you.

02:58.227 --> 02:59.560
Yours wants to kill me.

02:59.562 --> 03:01.094
Makes you regret turning any vampires

03:01.096 --> 03:02.529
in the first place.

03:02.531 --> 03:03.931
Well, the division of labor
seems crystal clear...

03:03.933 --> 03:05.566
two of them, two of u...

03:05.568 --> 03:07.868
us.

03:25.798 --> 03:27.948
"Roses are red. Lavender is blue.

03:29.601 --> 03:32.092
Come find me before I find you."

03:37.509 --> 03:39.700
I remember her a better poet.

03:40.217 --> 03:42.970
Oh, I wouldn't say that
this is lacking in poetry.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.639
She wants us to find her, so let's.

03:45.641 --> 03:47.741
You're so eager, Niklaus.

03:47.743 --> 03:50.010
Last time you even said her name was

03:50.012 --> 03:52.079
a thousand years ago when you told me

03:52.081 --> 03:54.915
never to speak it again in your presence.

03:54.917 --> 03:56.283
So I'm to wait till she leaves

03:56.285 --> 03:58.318
her little calling cards all over my home.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.122
There's something you should know.

04:02.124 --> 04:04.324
When mother seized control of my mind,

04:04.326 --> 04:05.859
unleashing those monstrosities

04:05.861 --> 04:08.295
that lurk behind the red door,

04:08.297 --> 04:12.899
I saw something.

04:12.901 --> 04:14.768
Aurora was there.

04:14.770 --> 04:17.137
If you mean to confess a
thousand-year-old secret

04:17.139 --> 04:18.839
that will divide us after our hard-won

04:18.841 --> 04:20.774
reconciliation, then te absolvo, brother.

04:20.776 --> 04:22.609
There is nothing you could have done

04:22.611 --> 04:24.011
involving her that would be worse

04:24.013 --> 04:25.345
than what she did to me.

04:25.347 --> 04:26.680
Please do not dismiss this, Nikla...

04:26.682 --> 04:28.482
whatever it is, it can wait.

04:28.484 --> 04:30.050
We have a plate of
here-and-now problems,

04:30.052 --> 04:31.151
and I mean to clear it.

04:31.153 --> 04:32.319
If it makes you feel any better,

04:32.321 --> 04:34.154
we can kill Aurora together.

04:34.156 --> 04:35.555
Then neither of us need play

04:35.557 --> 04:38.959
her little mind games ever again, hmm?

04:43.365 --> 04:46.266
Cami: So there is an active
serial killer at large,

04:46.268 --> 04:47.701
and the city's response is the throw

04:47.703 --> 04:49.936
a serial-killer-themed festival.

04:49.938 --> 04:51.772
Axeman's Jazz Fest is a big deal, Cami.

04:51.774 --> 04:53.373
Ain't nobody gonna sit that out

04:53.375 --> 04:55.809
because some active,
second-tier serial killer

04:55.811 --> 04:58.645
is on the loose, and as far as killers go,

04:58.647 --> 05:01.682
Axeman is the best this city's ever had.

05:01.684 --> 05:04.351
What? The year was 1919,
and after terrorizing

05:04.353 --> 05:07.154
the city or months with an actual ax,

05:07.156 --> 05:09.156
he writes a letter to
the "Times-Picayune,"

05:09.158 --> 05:10.991
claims he's a demon.

05:10.993 --> 05:13.193
He says he's gonna kill thousands

05:13.195 --> 05:14.594
the next night.

05:14.596 --> 05:16.997
Only way he wouldn't was if every house

05:16.999 --> 05:18.432
in the city threw a party and played jazz

05:18.434 --> 05:19.533
as loud as it could.

05:19.535 --> 05:20.901
Every single house in the city did.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.602
No one died. Ha-ha!

05:22.604 --> 05:23.937
Now, some people think it was a vampire.

05:23.939 --> 05:25.138
He was actually a witch.

05:25.140 --> 05:26.173
How do you know he's a witch?

05:26.175 --> 05:27.240
Oh, he's a witch.

05:27.242 --> 05:29.042
The day he chose was Fete de Kado.

05:29.044 --> 05:30.444
That's the day that every witch gives

05:30.446 --> 05:31.912
a gift to the city in the hopes

05:31.914 --> 05:33.246
that the city gives one back.

05:33.248 --> 05:35.449
Now, Axeman's idea of a gift

05:35.451 --> 05:37.584
was not murdering people for a day,

05:37.586 --> 05:40.053
and in return, look, this city threw him

05:40.055 --> 05:43.287
the greatest party it has ever seen.

05:43.546 --> 05:46.393
Wait, so what you're
saying is, while frat boys

05:46.395 --> 05:49.096
celebrate an ax murderer,
the witches are having

05:49.098 --> 05:51.576
their version of Christmas,
which makes them all

05:51.606 --> 05:53.567
easy pickings for whoever our killer is.

05:53.569 --> 05:54.968
You still think our playboy vampire

05:54.970 --> 05:56.636
is the best lead we got?

05:56.638 --> 05:58.772
My gut's telling me he's involved somehow,

05:58.774 --> 06:00.474
which means if he kills
again, it's my fault

06:00.476 --> 06:01.875
for convincing Klaus not to kill him,

06:01.877 --> 06:04.010
so I want to keep tabs on him.

06:04.012 --> 06:07.948
Well, well, well. Speak of the devil.

06:10.786 --> 06:13.754
(Sighs)

06:16.492 --> 06:18.959
Brother, she could be anywhere.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.794
How, exactly, do you intend to find her?

06:20.796 --> 06:22.095
She'll leave a mark.

06:22.097 --> 06:24.998
That is, after all, her favorite game.

06:27.569 --> 06:29.603
Oh... Oh...

06:29.605 --> 06:33.673
Well, that was fun... delightful,

06:33.675 --> 06:35.942
- delirious...
- Ha-ha!

06:35.944 --> 06:38.445
Delicious fun.

06:38.447 --> 06:40.680
Mm...

06:40.682 --> 06:43.817
Ah, and yet

06:43.819 --> 06:46.620
you would appear to want more.

06:46.622 --> 06:48.522
I fear I've not satisfied you.

06:48.524 --> 06:51.525
Your fears are absurd.

06:51.527 --> 06:53.627
- Ha-ha!
- Ha-ha!

06:53.629 --> 06:55.362
I'm not fragile, you know.

06:55.364 --> 06:57.798
You do not have to treat me so gently.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.533
I do not wish to hurt you.

06:59.535 --> 07:01.101
Well, then make me like you.

07:01.103 --> 07:02.669
Do to me what you did to Lucien.

07:02.671 --> 07:04.871
You know not what you ask.

07:04.873 --> 07:06.039
Well, I know we'd no longer

07:06.041 --> 07:07.440
have to hide our love...

07:07.442 --> 07:09.176
not from my father, my brother,

07:09.178 --> 07:10.544
not from anyone.

07:10.546 --> 07:12.646
If I were like you, I would be beholden

07:12.648 --> 07:14.881
to no one, and we could be together

07:14.883 --> 07:19.152
truly with no boundaries.

07:20.956 --> 07:26.827
You are perfect just the way you are.

07:27.911 --> 07:33.233
Take, for example,
these lovely, long locks.

07:33.235 --> 07:37.604
Hmm, now, how did you manage to capture

07:37.606 --> 07:39.639
the scent of a summer's day

07:39.641 --> 07:43.076
in the tresses of your hair?

07:50.757 --> 07:54.354
This mark that you speak of,

07:54.356 --> 07:56.556
see nothing, brother.

08:20.592 --> 08:22.282
I knew you would find me.

08:24.419 --> 08:26.386
Hello, my sweet love.

08:33.273 --> 08:35.594
I have to pick one. Orange or purple?

08:35.624 --> 08:38.013
Did you seriously call us
here to play "Fashion Police"?

08:38.043 --> 08:39.738
Ok. I know this is sacred oil,

08:39.768 --> 08:42.544
but can we please not do that right now?

08:42.575 --> 08:44.748
Thank you.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.116
(Sighs)

08:46.118 --> 08:48.385
Sorry. Thanks for coming.

08:48.387 --> 08:50.053
Like we had a choice, Davina.

08:50.055 --> 08:51.588
Either we do your bidding

08:51.590 --> 08:53.356
or you blow out that candle of yours

08:53.358 --> 08:54.924
and you turn us back into wolves,

08:54.926 --> 08:57.394
so we're pretty much your slaves.

08:57.396 --> 09:00.685
Now, Hayley, come on.
This is the deal we made.

09:00.865 --> 09:02.632
Let's let her say her piece, hmm?

09:02.634 --> 09:05.201
What do you want?

09:05.203 --> 09:07.070
This is my first kado as regent.

09:07.072 --> 09:08.471
Since I represent the city, the covens

09:08.473 --> 09:09.739
have to pay tribute to me,

09:09.741 --> 09:11.374
and I throw them a party.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.376
I need them to respect me, but this is

09:13.378 --> 09:15.078
the first public event since...

09:15.080 --> 09:16.646
since you had me kill those witches

09:16.648 --> 09:19.082
in the ninth ward?

09:19.882 --> 09:21.885
I have a feeling it might not go so well,

09:21.887 --> 09:23.553
especially since Van Nguyen blames me

09:23.555 --> 09:25.255
for what happened to his mom.

09:25.257 --> 09:27.062
He vowed to get back at me.

09:27.403 --> 09:30.493
Actually, he said he would erase me.

09:30.495 --> 09:33.163
I mean, who even talks like that?

09:33.696 --> 09:36.466
So you want us to be your bodyguards.

09:36.468 --> 09:38.168
Look. I know that you're not exactly

09:38.170 --> 09:39.669
thrilled with me right now,

09:39.671 --> 09:42.472
but if I die, that candle's
magic dies, too,

09:42.474 --> 09:43.773
and then there's nothing stopping you

09:43.775 --> 09:46.395
from changing back into wolves.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.280
Well, why don't you stay with Davina,

09:50.282 --> 09:53.683
and I will check out the crowd?

09:55.220 --> 09:57.520
I'll keep you alive,

09:58.139 --> 10:00.523
but if you wear that awful, orange scarf,

10:00.525 --> 10:03.760
you'll wish that I hadn't.

10:08.595 --> 10:11.773
A thousand years.

10:12.098 --> 10:14.059
Can it really have been so long?

10:14.089 --> 10:16.055
Looking at you now, it
feels like yesterday.

10:16.057 --> 10:18.324
If yesterday were the apocalypse.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.626
Are you saying that leaving me

10:19.628 --> 10:21.161
felt like the end of the world?

10:21.163 --> 10:23.096
Leaving you alive.

10:23.714 --> 10:25.265
I notice Elijah's not with you.

10:25.267 --> 10:26.766
Was he reluctant to tag along?

10:26.768 --> 10:28.168
On the contrary.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.335
He's been calling me incessantly since I

10:29.337 --> 10:31.404
ditched him to find you raving

10:31.406 --> 10:33.506
about some ancient secret

10:33.857 --> 10:36.695
and the possibility of using your head

10:36.725 --> 10:37.944
as a footstool.

10:37.946 --> 10:39.979
(Both chuckle)

10:40.533 --> 10:41.681
Well, I'm sure he would rather have

10:41.683 --> 10:43.903
his footstool than have me share

10:43.933 --> 10:45.952
that little secret.

10:45.954 --> 10:47.887
Let me guess.

10:47.889 --> 10:49.822
In the time between being with me

10:49.824 --> 10:52.091
and seeking refuge in
the arms of your brother,

10:52.093 --> 10:54.060
you slept with mine.

10:54.062 --> 10:57.185
Oh, your accusations are so banal.

10:57.215 --> 10:59.206
The truth is, I've never
been with your brother,

10:59.751 --> 11:01.350
at least not in the way that you think.

11:01.352 --> 11:03.886
Why are you here, Aurora?

11:04.828 --> 11:06.522
The witches here,

11:06.983 --> 11:08.758
they celebrate Fete de Kado...

11:09.118 --> 11:10.793
Feast of Gifts.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.296
It made me remember that very intimate gift

11:13.298 --> 11:17.266
we gave each other so long ago.

11:17.268 --> 11:19.053
(Sniffling)

11:20.105 --> 11:21.904
I always thought the day of one's birth

11:21.906 --> 11:24.240
was an event to be celebrated.

11:24.242 --> 11:25.742
(Sniffles)

11:25.744 --> 11:28.344
And yet I wish I'd not been born.

11:29.180 --> 11:31.416
(Sniffles)

11:32.548 --> 11:34.884
What saddens you so?

11:35.363 --> 11:38.821
Aurora, what is it? Tell me.

11:39.398 --> 11:43.359
The day of my birth is no occasion for joy.

11:44.329 --> 11:48.264
My mother died giving birth to me.

11:48.266 --> 11:50.399
That's my first act on this earth,

11:50.401 --> 11:53.569
was to kill the one who gave me life.

11:53.571 --> 11:57.173
It makes me cursed and broken,

11:57.175 --> 11:58.975
an abomination.

11:58.977 --> 12:01.010
I...

12:01.012 --> 12:03.579
(Sobs)

12:04.585 --> 12:08.951
You believe that you are cursed,

12:08.953 --> 12:11.888
but you are not alone.

12:15.593 --> 12:18.294
There is a thing that I have done

12:18.296 --> 12:21.631
that I never told anybody.

12:21.633 --> 12:24.567
It will break Rebekah's heart.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.869
Kol would rage.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.505
Finn would disown me, and Elijah...

12:32.076 --> 12:34.343
would never forgive me.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.420
I killed my mother...

12:46.491 --> 12:49.559
Not in childbirth, but in a fit of rage.

12:49.561 --> 12:53.863
Twice she birthed me... once as a bastard

12:53.865 --> 12:57.233
and then once as this thing I am now.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.335
She crippled me from becoming

12:59.337 --> 13:00.903
who I was meant to be, and then she

13:00.905 --> 13:03.539
turned her back on me in shame...

13:07.045 --> 13:10.313
And so I killed her,

13:10.315 --> 13:13.983
and I blamed it on my father,

13:13.985 --> 13:16.838
and we've been running ever since

13:16.868 --> 13:20.074
until now,

13:20.104 --> 13:22.852
until you,

13:22.882 --> 13:26.063
so, you see,

13:26.093 --> 13:28.097
how ever broken you think you are,

13:28.099 --> 13:30.800
you are not as broken as me.

13:34.671 --> 13:37.406
See, once again, you seek to repel me

13:37.408 --> 13:40.143
with our differences, but all I can see

13:40.145 --> 13:45.014
is how you and I are the same.

13:45.830 --> 13:48.184
Well, then let us share
this gift with each other.

13:48.549 --> 13:50.386
You will forever hold my deepest shame,

13:50.388 --> 13:53.637
and... I...

13:54.053 --> 13:56.759
I will hold yours.

13:56.761 --> 13:59.462
Never again shall we
speak them to another soul,

13:59.464 --> 14:03.699
and never again will they
have any power over us.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.039
Would you think it base of me to ask

14:10.041 --> 14:12.542
one more gift on my birthday?

14:12.544 --> 14:17.018
I would give you anything.

14:18.855 --> 14:21.295
Oh, then, please, Niklaus...

14:24.219 --> 14:26.345
Make me like you.

14:30.257 --> 14:32.461
You've had a thousand birthdays since.

14:32.463 --> 14:33.963
If I forgot to send a card,

14:33.965 --> 14:37.233
it's because I forgot about you.

14:37.235 --> 14:39.435
Is that why you're here,

14:39.437 --> 14:41.804
to remind me?

14:42.525 --> 14:45.368
I am here for the same reason
Lucien and Tristan are...

14:45.537 --> 14:47.460
to protect my sire.

14:47.696 --> 14:50.813
Now, if you turned me
that night like I'd asked,

14:51.048 --> 14:53.115
I would be here to protect you,

14:53.117 --> 14:56.052
but since you didn't, I need to know

14:56.054 --> 14:58.387
where in the hell is Rebekah?

15:14.939 --> 15:16.372
Elijah.

15:16.402 --> 15:18.646
I didn't realize we had a
meeting on the books today.

15:18.676 --> 15:19.342
We don't.

15:19.372 --> 15:20.466
Unfortunately, your assistant

15:20.496 --> 15:23.093
refused to accommodate me.

15:27.001 --> 15:28.501
What would you like to discuss?

15:28.531 --> 15:29.769
Recent events would suggest you've been

15:29.771 --> 15:31.170
less than forthcoming about threats

15:31.172 --> 15:32.972
facing my family.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.540
A threat to you is a threat to me.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.843
Naughty, little liar.

15:36.845 --> 15:39.601
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:39.631 --> 15:40.847
Oh, I'm quite certain you do know

15:40.849 --> 15:45.184
precisely what I am talking about, Tristan.

15:45.830 --> 15:48.460
I can hear that heart of yours racing away.

15:49.106 --> 15:50.657
You see, even as we speak,

15:50.960 --> 15:55.862
I suspect Niklaus is with your sister.

15:55.864 --> 15:57.730
I don't have to tell you what a volatile

15:57.732 --> 15:59.732
combination the two of them are.

15:59.734 --> 16:02.035
And you think I'm hiding her.

16:02.037 --> 16:04.904
Wherever you go, Aurora follows.

16:04.906 --> 16:06.372
It's true, on her good days.

16:06.374 --> 16:09.976
Years ago, Rory fell into
one of her dark periods.

16:09.978 --> 16:12.368
It's been a long one and has yet to lift.

16:12.398 --> 16:14.640
I saw she got the care she needed.

16:14.670 --> 16:17.917
I don't care. Where is she?

16:17.919 --> 16:19.752
Are you that afraid of what my sister

16:19.754 --> 16:21.688
might have to say to your brother?

16:21.690 --> 16:24.791
Your sister has a habit
of cultivating misfortune.

16:24.793 --> 16:27.260
I can't disagree, and as it happens,

16:27.262 --> 16:29.562
I don't know her current whereabouts,

16:29.564 --> 16:31.809
but I know she can't be here.

16:31.839 --> 16:33.800
I'm the first person she'd come to.

16:42.718 --> 16:45.712
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

16:56.167 --> 16:57.598
Cami: Do you think in a hundred years

16:57.628 --> 16:59.025
they'll be throwing him a party...

16:59.027 --> 17:02.094
smiley face carver blues fest?

17:02.096 --> 17:03.396
Vincent: Eh, well, everybody likes

17:03.398 --> 17:04.632
a charismatic killer.

17:04.662 --> 17:06.732
You and me know that better than most.

17:06.948 --> 17:08.367
Excuse me?

17:08.368 --> 17:12.165
You and Klaus, me and my psycho ex-wife.

17:12.544 --> 17:15.124
Why do you think I don't
practice magic anymore?

17:15.275 --> 17:16.731
There was something in me that was drawn

17:16.761 --> 17:18.527
to Eva's darkness, and I will always be

17:18.529 --> 17:20.596
on guard against that part of myself.

17:23.867 --> 17:27.368
Cami: No. No, no. What just happened?

17:27.848 --> 17:31.240
No. No. He's stringing us...

17:31.399 --> 17:32.637
Cami...

17:32.850 --> 17:33.694
Cami?

17:33.724 --> 17:34.515
Uh!

17:34.545 --> 17:36.775
(Pants)

17:37.897 --> 17:41.216
Cami, so good to see you.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.586
I've been dying to get you alone.

17:52.584 --> 17:54.117
(Sighs)

17:54.426 --> 17:56.252
You do know I was cleared of suspicion

17:56.254 --> 17:59.956
by real detectives, yet you hound me.

18:01.131 --> 18:02.158
Why is that?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.432
It's my job to read people,

18:03.462 --> 18:04.961
and you aren't that hard to read.

18:04.963 --> 18:07.703
Ha! Now, on that, we disagree.

18:07.733 --> 18:09.484
One thing we can agree on,

18:09.514 --> 18:11.434
this delicate, little theater between us

18:11.436 --> 18:16.640
does need to reach a conclusion, so...

18:16.642 --> 18:20.243
How do we end it?

18:22.145 --> 18:24.681
Heh. If you hurt me,

18:25.214 --> 18:27.984
I know a certain someone
who won't react very well.

18:28.383 --> 18:30.320
Ah, yes.

18:31.513 --> 18:33.893
You think because you
know someone like Klaus,

18:33.923 --> 18:35.792
you know someone like me?

18:35.794 --> 18:37.366
Well, you don't.

18:37.396 --> 18:40.369
You have no idea what I'm capable of,

18:41.609 --> 18:44.252
but you are about to find out.

18:46.914 --> 18:49.039
(Man gagging)

19:00.739 --> 19:02.385
Oh... Oh...

19:02.387 --> 19:05.455
No. No. No.

19:05.768 --> 19:06.695
Uh...

19:06.725 --> 19:09.525
You came all this way to protect Rebekah?

19:09.527 --> 19:11.995
Bit of a wasted trip, really.

19:11.997 --> 19:14.870
Your sire has moved on to greener pastures.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.800
My fate is bound to hers.

19:16.802 --> 19:18.857
I should be allowed to protect her.

19:18.887 --> 19:21.321
You needn't concern yourself with Rebekah.

19:21.323 --> 19:24.090
Besides, I doubt she'd make
the same mistake twice.

19:24.624 --> 19:26.426
The first mistake being...

19:26.428 --> 19:28.928
Ever trusting you.

19:30.198 --> 19:32.766
(Door opens)

19:33.969 --> 19:35.869
(Panting)

19:41.209 --> 19:43.243
Uh!

19:48.901 --> 19:50.750
(Gasping)

19:54.357 --> 19:56.189
You stupid girl,

19:56.191 --> 19:57.824
why would you do this to yourself?

19:58.034 --> 20:00.593
(Panting)

20:03.272 --> 20:04.864
It's Tristan.

20:04.866 --> 20:06.533
He forbade me from seeing Niklaus.

20:06.535 --> 20:08.334
Everything inside of me was screaming.

20:08.336 --> 20:09.636
I had to let it out.

20:09.638 --> 20:11.704
To take your own life?

20:11.706 --> 20:14.073
Aurora, this pain, it will pass.

20:14.075 --> 20:15.742
You do not understand.

20:15.844 --> 20:18.811
My own mind is a demon that haunts me.

20:18.813 --> 20:22.982
It tortures me and hunts me, but you...

20:22.984 --> 20:26.041
you are not saddled with such disease.

20:26.071 --> 20:29.906
You and your family, you're never ill,

20:30.105 --> 20:32.242
and if you are wounded...

20:34.980 --> 20:37.347
You heal like Lucien

20:37.349 --> 20:39.516
after Niklaus fed him blood.

20:39.518 --> 20:42.886
We have our own torments, Aurora,

20:42.888 --> 20:45.021
none that I would dare wish on another.

20:45.023 --> 20:46.990
Your torments of hunger and blood

20:46.992 --> 20:48.925
do not frighten me.

20:48.927 --> 20:51.194
Niklaus once told me
he never felt more alive

20:51.196 --> 20:52.695
than when he became what he is.

20:52.697 --> 20:54.564
And do we seem alive to you

20:54.566 --> 20:56.032
hiding in your family's manor,

20:56.034 --> 20:57.534
pretending to be of a class

20:57.536 --> 20:59.769
and a stature that we are not?

20:59.771 --> 21:01.576
We are cursed.

21:02.533 --> 21:04.727
Perhaps, but your curse

21:04.757 --> 21:07.977
is nothing compared to mine.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.786
Please go. I want to sleep.

21:16.788 --> 21:19.088
Oh, sweet girl.

21:36.708 --> 21:38.508
(Creak)

21:44.232 --> 21:47.713
Aurora, voice-over: Your sister
smelled of wild berries...

21:47.743 --> 21:50.069
it was intoxicating...

21:55.310 --> 21:58.444
and the night smelled of lavender.

21:58.446 --> 21:59.985
(Wind whistling)

22:00.015 --> 22:02.682
I could see the garden from above.

22:13.248 --> 22:17.313
The last thing I remember
as a human was that scent,

22:17.315 --> 22:20.750
which clung to me all the way down.

22:24.856 --> 22:26.489
(Baa)

22:26.491 --> 22:27.957
(Chickens clucking)

22:27.959 --> 22:29.459
(Baa)

22:29.461 --> 22:31.349
Another goat. How lovely.

22:31.379 --> 22:32.779
(Baa)

22:32.781 --> 22:34.380
I'd like to thank the Gentilly coven

22:34.382 --> 22:37.751
for their generous gift on
this day of Fete de Kado.

22:39.354 --> 22:41.855
(Oinking)

22:41.857 --> 22:44.524
(Baa)

22:45.681 --> 22:48.561
I apologize. I need a minute.

22:48.563 --> 22:50.730
(Murmuring)

22:59.263 --> 23:02.041
Not a fan of goats, huh?

23:02.043 --> 23:04.477
I love goats, but do you know

23:04.479 --> 23:07.413
how many of them I've had to sacrifice?

23:07.715 --> 23:10.416
Just once, I'd like to get a gift card.

23:10.418 --> 23:12.318
I mean, I know this is all tradition,

23:12.320 --> 23:15.188
but it's just not me,

23:15.190 --> 23:17.009
and you know what I really hate?

23:17.039 --> 23:18.033
That choker scarf?

23:18.063 --> 23:21.427
This choker scarf, and I only wore it

23:21.429 --> 23:22.826
because Josephine did
and I thought that maybe

23:22.856 --> 23:26.599
if I were more like her, then...

23:26.601 --> 23:30.036
then maybe they would respect me.

23:30.341 --> 23:33.673
Here. You need this more than I do.

23:38.713 --> 23:40.780
(Chuckles)

23:40.782 --> 23:43.082
You know, Davina, I...

23:43.084 --> 23:44.784
I wasn't ok with what you had me do

23:44.786 --> 23:47.286
to the Versailles coven...

23:48.990 --> 23:51.924
But I'm guessing that you're
not ok with it, either,

23:51.926 --> 23:54.093
so you're running from it,
pretending to be someone

23:54.095 --> 23:56.562
that you're not, someone who you think

23:56.564 --> 24:00.032
that they want you to be.

24:00.034 --> 24:03.402
You know what I learned?

24:03.404 --> 24:05.638
No one is gonna respect you

24:05.640 --> 24:08.341
until you show them who you really are,

24:08.343 --> 24:13.312
so if you're gonna wear
old-lady choker scarves...

24:15.416 --> 24:17.650
You're gonna get old-lady goats.

24:17.652 --> 24:19.418
(Chuckles)

24:21.122 --> 24:22.755
(Chuckles)

24:27.428 --> 24:30.630
Marcel: Is that all you got, a hunch?

24:30.632 --> 24:32.798
Elijah: I don't do hunches.

24:33.146 --> 24:34.967
I've known Tristan a thousand years.

24:34.969 --> 24:37.570
He's not easily shaken, and yet I heard

24:37.572 --> 24:39.906
that little weasel's heart pound

24:39.908 --> 24:42.408
when I accused him of working with someone

24:42.410 --> 24:45.077
and, strangely, nothing
when I mentioned Aurora.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.848
He may be telling the truth about that.

24:48.850 --> 24:51.417
But he could be hiding something,

24:51.419 --> 24:53.686
and now you need my help finding out what.

24:53.688 --> 24:55.254
Would be splendid, Marcellus.

24:55.256 --> 24:57.857
You do have that fabulous,
new Strix membership.

24:57.859 --> 24:59.825
Hmm, I'm only with those people

24:59.827 --> 25:01.494
because I want to know
why they're in my city,

25:01.496 --> 25:02.862
and I'm not blowing my cover

25:02.864 --> 25:06.032
just because you heard a guy's heart skip,

25:06.034 --> 25:08.634
but, lucky for you, I got the city wired

25:08.636 --> 25:11.370
in ways you don't even know about.

25:11.372 --> 25:13.739
I'll have my people trail your boy.

25:13.741 --> 25:16.642
Let's see what they find out.

25:16.644 --> 25:18.644
You can always catch an insect

25:18.646 --> 25:21.480
with the smell of a flower...

25:22.884 --> 25:26.385
But it's the smell of blood
that draws a carnivore.

25:26.387 --> 25:28.788
And what draws a snake?

25:28.790 --> 25:31.357
Ooh, how you loathe me,

25:31.359 --> 25:33.893
so certain I've come to do you harm,

25:34.174 --> 25:35.494
yet, as I recall,

25:35.496 --> 25:37.563
we did plenty of harm to each other,

25:37.565 --> 25:38.931
and, if I'm not mistaken,

25:38.933 --> 25:41.300
we both rather liked it, didn't we?

25:56.951 --> 25:59.018
What have you done?

25:59.020 --> 26:01.187
Remade myself into your equal.

26:01.189 --> 26:02.888
- No!
- Yes.

26:02.890 --> 26:05.324
Now we need never be alone.

26:07.646 --> 26:08.966
(Chomp)

26:08.996 --> 26:11.807
- Mm!
- Ah.

26:16.137 --> 26:18.938
(Panting)

26:26.881 --> 26:28.948
Aurora, voice-over: Do you
remember what that first time

26:28.950 --> 26:30.983
felt like to be with someone

26:30.985 --> 26:33.419
who's every bit as powerful,

26:33.421 --> 26:36.894
as tormented, and as cursed

26:37.650 --> 26:39.759
as you?

26:42.630 --> 26:44.843
Yes.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.834
Look me in the eye

26:48.836 --> 26:50.736
and tell me that you haven't thought

26:50.738 --> 26:53.072
about what we had every day

26:53.074 --> 26:55.708
for the last thousand years.

26:56.911 --> 26:59.779
You want to know why I have come?

26:59.781 --> 27:01.747
Because after a thousand years

27:01.749 --> 27:04.550
of trying to erase your touch,

27:04.552 --> 27:09.422
your smell, the taste of your lips...

27:12.026 --> 27:14.694
I'm here for you...

27:17.365 --> 27:19.498
For this.

27:32.935 --> 27:34.134
(Police radio chatter)

27:35.271 --> 27:37.337
There's nothing I could've done.

27:37.339 --> 27:40.607
Well, I could've. I could've.

27:40.609 --> 27:42.609
Lucien's our killer, right?

27:42.611 --> 27:44.445
I mean, is there really any doubt?

27:44.447 --> 27:45.979
And, like you said from the very beginning,

27:45.981 --> 27:48.115
you can't use cops to take down a vampire.

27:48.117 --> 27:49.783
You got to use something else,

27:49.785 --> 27:51.018
something like me.

27:51.020 --> 27:53.253
What if I told you there was a way

27:53.255 --> 27:56.557
you could use magic
without actually doing it?

27:57.793 --> 27:59.698
Kinney: You had quite a night, O'Connell,

28:00.870 --> 28:02.029
hmm?

28:02.031 --> 28:04.198
I guess I took a wrong turn.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.266
You mean to tell me
you just turned a corner

28:06.592 --> 28:07.801
and happened to find a victim

28:07.803 --> 28:11.303
in the murder case you're
independently investigating, huh?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.806
Vince, you were there for all this?

28:12.808 --> 28:14.541
I got here, she was trying to save the guy.

28:14.543 --> 28:15.976
She was too late. That's it.

28:15.978 --> 28:17.277
Right, so you found her after she'd been

28:17.279 --> 28:19.629
alone with the victim, is that right?

28:20.816 --> 28:23.050
Are you accusing me?

28:23.448 --> 28:24.451
All I know is, I used to have

28:24.453 --> 28:26.120
to call you to these crime scenes.

28:26.122 --> 28:28.989
Now here you are, part of one.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.606
(Men chanting)

28:51.303 --> 28:55.215
In the name of those we lost,
we will have justice for them.

28:56.508 --> 28:57.885
Hey!

28:57.887 --> 29:00.020
Uh! Uh!

29:00.022 --> 29:02.289
Uh! You're a little old
to be playing with dolls.

29:02.291 --> 29:03.790
You gonna finish me

29:03.792 --> 29:06.160
like your people finished off my mom?

29:07.496 --> 29:08.662
Come on.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.534
(Panting)

29:19.208 --> 29:20.541
(Gasps)

29:20.543 --> 29:21.842
We could've been the greatest

29:21.844 --> 29:23.816
love story ever told.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.879
Perhaps you've forgotten why we're not.

29:25.881 --> 29:28.447
Oh, I remember quite well.

29:28.477 --> 29:30.417
The night you left without me,

29:30.419 --> 29:32.653
you didn't even bother to look back.

29:32.655 --> 29:34.354
I knew it would come to this,

29:34.356 --> 29:35.822
be it Kol's antics or yours

29:35.824 --> 29:37.724
or those creatures you and Rebekah created.

29:38.058 --> 29:39.026
What is it?

29:39.028 --> 29:40.294
Word has spread.

29:40.296 --> 29:41.495
The villagers talk of beasts

29:41.497 --> 29:42.629
who feed on blood,

29:42.631 --> 29:44.231
and if these country imbeciles know...

29:44.233 --> 29:47.568
Father will come. We need to flee.

29:48.352 --> 29:50.671
Run away with you?

29:50.673 --> 29:53.674
Leave my brother, this house?

29:53.676 --> 29:55.576
Klaus: The world is bigger than this house.

29:55.578 --> 29:57.411
- Let me show you.
- How,

29:57.413 --> 30:00.480
as we hide fleeing your brute of a father,

30:00.482 --> 30:03.016
always on the run, living like dogs?

30:03.018 --> 30:04.423
I think not.

30:04.453 --> 30:06.392
Your brother has turned you from me.

30:06.422 --> 30:10.491
No. I turned from you
because I do not love you.

30:12.588 --> 30:13.861
I...

30:13.863 --> 30:16.530
I thought I did, but it's as if

30:16.532 --> 30:19.234
I see you clearly for the first time,

30:19.264 --> 30:21.735
and I find you a cruel, wretched thing,

30:21.737 --> 30:24.242
pathetic, really, and unworthy

30:24.272 --> 30:27.174
of anyone's love, let alone mine.

30:27.707 --> 30:29.310
You don't mean that.

30:29.312 --> 30:33.414
After all, your own
mother turned against you.

30:33.616 --> 30:35.782
If she who gave you life
could come to loathe you

30:35.784 --> 30:38.318
and then be snuffed out by your own hand,

30:38.320 --> 30:40.454
then what hope is there for you?

30:44.326 --> 30:47.127
You're breaking my heart...

30:48.697 --> 30:50.631
And you swore

30:50.633 --> 30:54.401
that you would never speak of this.

30:54.403 --> 30:57.037
I owe you nothing.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.773
We are not alike,

30:59.775 --> 31:03.043
and I could never love you.

31:16.812 --> 31:19.359
You know, you should count yourself lucky.

31:19.361 --> 31:21.128
In a thousand years, no one has talked

31:21.130 --> 31:22.729
to me that way and lived.

31:22.731 --> 31:25.165
Yes. I was rather cruel, wasn't I?

31:25.167 --> 31:28.535
Some might say uncharacteristically so.

31:28.537 --> 31:30.237
What are you getting at?

31:30.239 --> 31:33.307
I was not the architect of our heartbreak.

31:33.309 --> 31:36.849
In the moments before you
asked me to flee with you,

31:38.174 --> 31:40.914
I saw your brother.

31:42.174 --> 31:43.583
Aurora: Where are you going?

31:43.585 --> 31:45.190
Father is coming. We have to leave.

31:45.220 --> 31:46.553
Well, then I will come with you.

31:46.555 --> 31:47.921
No. No.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.190
His curse is ours and ours alone to bear.

31:50.192 --> 31:51.658
But I am like you now.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.226
You are not our blood.

31:53.228 --> 31:55.028
What difference does blood make,

31:55.030 --> 31:56.630
all this talk of your sacred family bond

31:56.632 --> 31:59.800
when I know things about
him that you never will,

31:59.802 --> 32:03.837
even that which weighs
heaviest on his heart.

32:04.386 --> 32:06.006
What did you say?

32:06.008 --> 32:08.275
I told him I wouldn't betray you

32:08.277 --> 32:10.310
and that true love transcends blood,

32:10.312 --> 32:12.145
but he wouldn't listen to me.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.980
He just had one question.

32:13.982 --> 32:17.317
What could you possibly know
about my brother that I do not?

32:18.821 --> 32:23.023
What, precisely, did my brother say to you?

32:23.025 --> 32:25.502
Speak!

32:30.766 --> 32:33.433
And so you told him.

32:33.435 --> 32:37.170
I couldn't stop the words
flying out of my mouth,

32:37.172 --> 32:40.574
words I swore I would never
tell to another living soul

32:40.576 --> 32:42.843
about how you killed your mother

32:42.845 --> 32:45.512
and blamed your father and you had to lie

32:45.514 --> 32:48.248
to them all so that
they would flee with you.

32:48.250 --> 32:52.152
He... he killed our mother?

32:52.154 --> 32:54.157
Niklaus.

32:55.023 --> 32:57.157
Why did I tell you?

32:57.159 --> 33:00.060
I swore I would keep his secret.

33:01.663 --> 33:04.397
So he... he lied to me.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.300
He's lied to us all.

33:07.302 --> 33:11.271
And yet I love him in spite of it.

33:12.140 --> 33:15.342
He does not deserve your love.

33:15.344 --> 33:17.878
You listen to me.

33:18.847 --> 33:20.447
You must only see him

33:20.449 --> 33:22.249
as the wretched, deceitful monster

33:22.251 --> 33:24.317
that he truly is.

33:24.319 --> 33:28.822
I see him as the monster that he is.

33:35.631 --> 33:38.832
When you came to me not minutes later

33:38.834 --> 33:41.201
begging me to go with you,

33:41.203 --> 33:43.303
I could not say yes.

33:43.305 --> 33:45.705
I had been compelled otherwise.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.875
I believe it was the first time

33:48.877 --> 33:50.877
he experienced the ability to compel,

33:50.879 --> 33:53.013
and when he understood what he did,

33:53.015 --> 33:55.315
he did not come and undo it.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.818
So that's it...

34:02.124 --> 34:04.424
Elijah's secret.

34:08.094 --> 34:12.732
Yes. You made him suffer
the loss of a mother,

34:12.734 --> 34:15.168
and this was his revenge.

34:22.303 --> 34:23.607
You've already taken
everything away from me,

34:23.637 --> 34:25.120
so go ahead.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.987
Kill me. Get it over with.

34:28.018 --> 34:30.351
You tried to murder a regent,

34:30.353 --> 34:31.953
by which law you should be hanged.

34:31.955 --> 34:33.420
Murder?

34:33.422 --> 34:36.190
Is that the first place your mind goes?

34:36.193 --> 34:40.161
Do you even know what I
was using to attack you?

34:47.070 --> 34:48.937
This isn't to kill me.

34:48.938 --> 34:51.005
It's a figure veritas.

34:51.007 --> 34:52.574
Stab it in the heart, and
the victim must confess

34:52.576 --> 34:54.376
their darkest truths.

34:54.918 --> 34:58.146
You wanted me to admit
what I did to your mom

34:58.148 --> 34:59.581
so I'd be shunned.

34:59.583 --> 35:01.082
Maybe I'd rather see you dead,

35:01.084 --> 35:02.539
but at least that would be justice.

35:02.569 --> 35:04.870
Look. She's the one who attacked me.

35:04.872 --> 35:06.471
She wanted a mutiny, and if that happens,

35:06.473 --> 35:07.873
what's next, an all-out witch war

35:07.875 --> 35:09.574
to decide the next regent?

35:09.576 --> 35:12.210
How many more people will die then?

35:12.240 --> 35:14.779
So you think the covens
are better off with you.

35:16.783 --> 35:20.652
I do. I've seen things done the old way.

35:20.654 --> 35:23.455
I've done things the old
way, and it doesn't work.

35:23.457 --> 35:26.024
If you don't want peace, then, fine, go...

35:26.026 --> 35:29.628
you're free... but I'm
asking you, please stay.

35:29.630 --> 35:32.597
We can work together. We can change things.

35:44.341 --> 35:48.179
Elijah: Niklaus, would
you kindly return my call?

35:49.112 --> 35:50.649
Marcellus, talk to me.

35:51.429 --> 35:53.652
Yep. We got a problem.

35:53.654 --> 35:55.654
My guy stayed on Tristan's tail all day,

35:55.656 --> 35:58.456
followed him to this place
called the Candide Royale.

35:58.691 --> 36:00.959
He goes in, never comes out,

36:00.961 --> 36:02.327
so he's obviously using it as a way

36:02.329 --> 36:04.638
- to get to somewhere else.
- How and where?

36:04.668 --> 36:06.464
The building has hidden passageways

36:06.466 --> 36:07.699
leading out the back.

36:07.701 --> 36:09.134
Now, bootleggers used them in the twenties

36:09.136 --> 36:11.970
to run booze to a secret
storehouse on Dauphine,

36:11.972 --> 36:15.040
and you'll never guess who
just bought that storehouse.

36:15.042 --> 36:20.045
Kingmaker Land Development,
owned by one Lucien Castle.

36:20.047 --> 36:22.247
Now, that sure as hell isn't a coincidence.

36:22.249 --> 36:24.549
Either they're brokering
some kind of truce...

36:24.551 --> 36:27.152
Or they've been working
together the whole time.

36:29.156 --> 36:31.056
You have had a thousand years

36:31.058 --> 36:32.924
to tell me of Elijah's betrayal.

36:32.926 --> 36:34.526
Why now?

36:34.528 --> 36:36.161
Well, there's never been a prophecy witch

36:36.163 --> 36:38.229
spelling all of our doom until now.

36:38.231 --> 36:39.564
What do you know of her?

36:39.566 --> 36:41.666
I know I killed her.

36:42.149 --> 36:44.602
My brother told me of her prophecy, but...

36:44.604 --> 36:45.602
(Sniffles)

36:45.632 --> 36:47.945
I needed to see her for myself,

36:47.975 --> 36:49.908
and what did she show me?

36:50.347 --> 36:52.911
The clan Mikaelson destroyed,

36:53.542 --> 36:56.982
including my sire, and I believed her,

36:56.984 --> 36:58.917
but a dangerous toy in dangerous hands

36:58.919 --> 37:02.153
must be removed, so I poisoned her,

37:02.541 --> 37:03.688
and now I'm going to change

37:03.690 --> 37:05.257
the future she saw.

37:05.259 --> 37:08.393
By turning me against the
only brother I have left.

37:08.395 --> 37:10.962
The prophecy said that you would fall

37:10.964 --> 37:15.433
by friend, by foe, and by family.

37:15.435 --> 37:19.070
Have you thought of who
that family might be?

37:19.072 --> 37:21.773
Because it just might be
the one closest to you.

37:32.316 --> 37:37.319
Happy... witch day or whatever this is.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.026
(Chuckles)

37:39.432 --> 37:41.656
Hayley, I wanted to thank you.

37:41.658 --> 37:45.093
For what, the free fashion advice?

37:45.095 --> 37:46.394
(Chuckles)

37:46.396 --> 37:48.230
You were right.

37:48.232 --> 37:50.739
Since I became regent,
I've tried to control

37:50.769 --> 37:53.168
everything and everyone,

37:54.688 --> 37:56.037
but that's not me.

37:56.039 --> 37:58.840
I don't want to be that person anymore.

38:05.693 --> 38:08.006
I asked the ancestors to give me the magic

38:08.036 --> 38:10.151
to lift your curse.

38:10.153 --> 38:12.254
Since it's Kado...

38:15.149 --> 38:16.391
They granted it.

38:16.393 --> 38:18.693
Huh.

38:19.287 --> 38:21.171
Keeping you as a slave seems like something

38:21.201 --> 38:24.399
the older generation would do.

38:24.841 --> 38:27.068
I'd rather have you as a friend.

38:39.266 --> 38:40.615
You realize half this stuff comes

38:40.617 --> 38:42.242
from the Treme witches, right?

38:42.272 --> 38:45.579
How would I know?
I inherited it all from my uncle.

38:45.812 --> 38:50.191
You don't even want to know
what this stuff does, Camille.

38:51.995 --> 38:53.595
Why didn't you tell me about it before?

38:53.597 --> 38:56.264
Oh, yeah. "Hey, Vincent,
you want to check out

38:56.266 --> 38:59.128
my creepy collection of
black-magic knickknacks?"

38:59.158 --> 39:01.300
See, this is not a joke, all right?

39:01.330 --> 39:03.171
In the wrong hands, this
stuff could destroy the city.

39:03.173 --> 39:05.907
Kinney: Define the wrong hands
because I'm taking all of it,

39:05.909 --> 39:08.904
property of Nola PD,
evidence in a murder case.

39:08.934 --> 39:09.990
Detective Kinney, how did you...

39:10.020 --> 39:12.252
you really think it was hard
for me to find this place?

39:12.921 --> 39:14.692
Search warrant was easy.

39:14.722 --> 39:15.984
I just gave the judge your history.

39:15.986 --> 39:18.352
Your twin brother was a mass murderer.

39:18.382 --> 39:20.021
Your Uncle's death smells of a cover-up,

39:20.023 --> 39:21.790
and the forensics from
tonight's crime scene,

39:21.792 --> 39:26.906
crazy thing, only prints
on the victim are yours.

39:26.936 --> 39:29.861
Combine that with
whatever the hell this is,

39:29.891 --> 39:31.833
call that probable cause.

39:31.835 --> 39:35.337
Cami O'Connell, you're under arrest.

39:41.468 --> 39:43.912
I've given you much to think about.

39:43.914 --> 39:46.047
I'll leave you to work through.

39:49.205 --> 39:53.655
Go to Elijah. Ask him yourself.

39:53.657 --> 39:56.291
I suspect you know what you will find...

39:59.196 --> 40:02.864
And when you do, come find me.

40:04.501 --> 40:07.002
See who's really on your side.

40:11.475 --> 40:13.174
(Gulp)

40:14.953 --> 40:16.878
She told you.

40:18.663 --> 40:20.815
How convenient to voice
this ancient grievance

40:20.817 --> 40:22.717
in the very moment we need to stand united

40:22.719 --> 40:25.053
against our enemies.

40:25.055 --> 40:27.922
You speak to me of enemies

40:27.924 --> 40:30.225
when the greatest traitor of my life

40:30.227 --> 40:33.094
stands before me.

40:49.615 --> 40:53.715
What you did to Aurora, to me,

40:53.717 --> 40:55.884
you set my course!

40:55.886 --> 40:57.585
I protected you.

40:57.587 --> 41:00.021
I protected our family.

41:00.051 --> 41:01.978
Aurora was the sister of a lunatic

41:02.008 --> 41:03.725
and a powerful lunatic, at that.

41:03.727 --> 41:05.260
Father was in pursuit.

41:05.262 --> 41:07.762
What was I supposed to do, Niklaus?

41:07.764 --> 41:10.671
And despite every one
of your despicable deeds,

41:10.701 --> 41:13.635
I alone have always stood by you.

41:14.079 --> 41:16.771
And why is that?

41:16.773 --> 41:18.940
Guilt.

41:19.549 --> 41:22.262
You knew that your secret betrayal

41:22.292 --> 41:25.046
was the cause of everything I became!

41:26.750 --> 41:28.316
Aagh... Haah...

41:28.318 --> 41:29.551
Agh!

41:37.202 --> 41:39.194
All this blame!

41:40.964 --> 41:44.332
Will you ever look at yourself?

41:45.541 --> 41:48.503
I have carried you for centuries, Niklaus.

41:49.238 --> 41:52.006
No more.

41:52.630 --> 41:54.075
You want a fight?

41:57.710 --> 41:59.347
So be it.
