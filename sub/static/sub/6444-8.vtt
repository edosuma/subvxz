00:12.840 --> 00:14.193
Thank you for the lift.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.954
With any luck, my car will be
out of the garage tomorrow.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.917
Oh, bummer.
I love being your chauffeur.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.550
We can chat, and I get to spend
quality time with my new best friend.

00:22.720 --> 00:23.994
I'm proud of you, Lois.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.720
Living in your own apartment,
buying a brand-new car.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.474
- You've really grown up.
- Oh, let's not get carried away.

00:29.640 --> 00:30.914
The car's my safety net.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.958
When I lose my job and apartment,
I'll need somewhere to sleep.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.239
- Thanks again.
- See you. Bye.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.038
Bye.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.112
Shelby?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.879
Mom? Mom. Mom.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.189
Mom, wake up.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.956
- Are you okay? Mom?
- L... I must have fainted.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.952
I haven't eaten anything today.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.479
That sound, flash of light,
what was that?

01:40.280 --> 01:42.510
What are you talking about?

02:44.160 --> 02:46.674
According to the Weather Bureau,
at 10:35 last night...

02:46.840 --> 02:49.718
...other than a little rain,
there was nothing over Smallville.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.758
- That doesn't rule out heat lightning.
- Nothing was reported.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.276
Clark, most people are interested
in the forecast, not the past-cast.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.749
- What's going on?
- Last night I heard a sound.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.229
It sounded like thunder.
Then I saw a bright light.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.630
Outside, I found my mom
unconscious in the field.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.189
- Oh, my God.
- I thought she was struck by lightning.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.555
- Is she all right?
- Fine, like nothing happened.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.995
- That's the weird part.
- Maybe she passed out.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.878
- Has she seen a doctor?
- This morning.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.237
- They couldn't find anything wrong.
- Then why are you so worried?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.994
I wanna know where that sound
and that light came from.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.152
Maybe someone was setting off
fireworks in the field next to you.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.517
Maybe your super hearing picked up
a car backfiring two counties away.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.958
What does it matter? Your mom's fine.
You don't have anything to worry about.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.789
All right, why do I feel like I'm getting
the abridged version of this story?

03:38.920 --> 03:41.639
I think Jor-El might have
something to do with this.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.597
Your biological father?

03:43.760 --> 03:46.832
When I died and he brought me back,
he made a deal.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.476
He's come back to collect.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.918
Don't take this the wrong way,
but after 800 pictures...

04:00.080 --> 04:02.548
<i>...you</i> don't get any prettier.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.190
That's enough. Thanks, guys.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.031
How about a latte?

04:09.520 --> 04:11.397
Don't you find this just a tad <i>sleazy...</i>

04:11.560 --> 04:14.677
...holding a campaign photo shoot
where Martha Kent works?

04:14.840 --> 04:18.548
You might as well, I don't know,
go out to their farm and milk their cows.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.111
In case you don't know where your
paycheck comes from, I own the Talon.

04:25.360 --> 04:29.319
What don't you own? I guess now
you wanna own the government.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.074
Why are you so angry, Lois?

04:34.240 --> 04:35.673
What have I ever done to you?

04:35.840 --> 04:38.718
You just remind me of
the pseudo-politicians I grew up around.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.996
You know, men who bought their
way into office.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.628
But do you really think
you can beat Jonathan Kent?

04:43.800 --> 04:47.156
There must be enough dirt on you
to create a landmass the size of Texas.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.039
Please, grab a shovel
and start digging.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.430
I have nothing to hide.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.956
Let me give you a little friendly advice:

04:57.440 --> 04:58.668
Bow out of the race...

04:58.840 --> 05:02.355
...before a pesky little squirrel
digs up one of your rotten acorns.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.551
Well, thanks, Lois.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.031
You know,
there's nothing more <i>valuable...</i>

05:08.200 --> 05:13.115
...than the savvy political advice
of a muffin-peddling college dropout.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.909
Speaking of, do you have
banana blueberry today?

05:23.320 --> 05:27.393
Well, many humans believe
that Earth was created in seven days.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.279
Surprised it took you that long
to trust me.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.234
I wanna know more about Jor-EI.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.433
What son doesn't wanna learn more
about his absentee father?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.431
But like all great figures in history...

05:40.600 --> 05:42.909
...he can only be understood
in the proper context.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.799
- We must start at the beginning, Kal-EI.
- I don't have time.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.758
I'm worried.
He's done something to my mother.

05:48.920 --> 05:53.391
Is your concern based on the bargain
Jor-El made with you?

05:53.560 --> 05:56.279
- How do you know about that?
- I know more than you imagine.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.034
I've been keeping an eye on you
for months.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.794
Does your mother have any
markings on her skin?

06:02.480 --> 06:03.913
No.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.389
Why? Does that have
something to do with Jor-EI?

06:06.560 --> 06:07.993
All in due time.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.628
He's my father.
I have the right to know about him.

06:10.800 --> 06:14.588
- I agree. When you're ready.
- I'm ready now!

06:20.040 --> 06:23.999
Impatience is
such a pathetic human trait.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.352
I suppose it's to be expected from
someone raised by such a primitive race.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.915
I happen to care a great deal
about this primitive race.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.150
A lot more than I do about Krypton.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.151
Waiting. Patiently.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.790
A Kryptonian is teaching history
at Central Kansas University?

07:00.960 --> 07:04.350
I didn't believe it either
until I saw him use his powers.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.953
He can do everything I can.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.759
You've seen meteor-infected people
do all kinds of things.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.399
It doesn't mean he's Kryptonian.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.836
He calls me Kal-EI.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.479
And he knows about Krypton.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.555
Clark, I want you
to steer clear of this fellow.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.431
- Clark.
- I didn't have a choice.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.037
What do you mean?
You always have a choice, son.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.636
- I wanted to learn more about Jor-EI.
- I'll tell you what you need to know.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.792
Every Kryptonian has been
hell-bent on death and destruction.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.589
You can't judge an entire people by
the acts of a few. Clark is Kryptonian.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.878
Kryptonian raised by human beings
with strong values.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.589
Clark, we don't have any idea
who this professor really is.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.398
He's done nothing but help so far.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.710
He told me the truth about Lex.
He saved Lana.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.758
- He took the Silver Kryptonite out of me.
- But why, Clark?

07:53.920 --> 07:57.117
We have no idea
what his motives really are.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.475
- I'Il...
- I'll get it, sweetheart.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.433
Mom!

08:07.640 --> 08:09.517
I can't feel my hand.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.151
Oh, God. My shoulder's burning.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.592
Dad, what did the doctor say?

08:39.760 --> 08:42.479
They don't know what it is.
They gave us some antibiotics...

08:42.640 --> 08:45.234
...and said I should call
if anything got worse. Come on.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.470
They're just gonna
let her come home?

08:47.880 --> 08:50.599
Clark, the doctor said
her vital signs are perfectly normal.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.149
Normal? I found her unconscious
in the driveway.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.311
That's anything but normal.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.595
Is there something
you're not telling me, son?

09:02.400 --> 09:03.833
I'm just worried about Mom.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.230
Me too. But don't worry,
she's gonna be fine.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.078
Come on.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.392
Miss Sullivan.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.717
Mr. Luthor. What are you doing here?

09:34.240 --> 09:39.030
You have made it
to the major leagues.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.833
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.713
Very, very nice.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.152
You've done quite well for yourself.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.072
I am certain that sooner than later...

09:55.240 --> 09:59.472
...you're gonna be working upstairs
under the Tiffany lamps.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.549
A big story certainly would
accelerate the process.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.837
Not that obituaries...

10:06.000 --> 10:09.436
...and wedding announcements
don't inspire scintillating journalism.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.831
If you're trying to feed me
some sort of self-promoting fluff piece...

10:13.000 --> 10:14.592
<i>...I'm</i> not interested.

10:14.760 --> 10:18.435
You can put a tuxedo on the fiddler but
he's still gonna play the same old tune.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.672
That's good. You should jot that down
and add it to your calendar.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.114
I gotta go.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.239
Your creative passion will always be
for the bizarre and the inexplicable.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.233
That's why I think you're
the perfect reporter for this story.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.790
You have one minute.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.311
The clock is ticking.

10:41.560 --> 10:45.235
It seems there is someone
at Central Kansas University...

10:45.400 --> 10:51.191
...who has the astounding ability
to run at virtually the speed of light.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.158
Have you ever heard of such a thing?

10:54.320 --> 10:58.279
The school is located in Smallville,
meteor-freak capital of the world.

10:58.440 --> 11:02.115
This person can lift an automobile
with one hand.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.272
Can create fire
with the blink of an eye.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.192
It's extraordinary.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.115
It sounds like a bit of a stretch,
even for me. Do you have any proof?

11:12.280 --> 11:15.989
If we had proof there wouldn't be
any need for investigative reporting.

11:16.400 --> 11:20.154
The person's name is Milton Fine.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.039
He is a professor of world history.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.838
Why did you come to me?

11:25.080 --> 11:26.593
Frankly?

11:27.560 --> 11:30.028
I didn't think <i>TIME</i> magazine
would be interested.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.435
Good day, Miss Sullivan.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.199
Professor.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.271
Are you shaking me down
for lecture notes?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.431
Or are you ready to begin
independent study?

11:49.600 --> 11:53.195
A mark showed up on my mom.
The doctors don't know what it is.

11:53.360 --> 11:57.558
- Describe it to me.
- It's like a bruise with veiny strands.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.792
- Did it start on her left shoulder?
- Yes.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.752
Your father tortured his dissidents
on Krypton the same exact way.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.512
What?

12:11.080 --> 12:14.470
I don't suppose I can
hide the truth from you any longer.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.798
He was a violent dictator.

12:18.800 --> 12:23.191
He ruled over Krypton with an iron grip
of fear and intimidation.

12:23.440 --> 12:27.592
Anybody who spoke out against him
was locked away.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.554
Even the great
hero of the people, Zod.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.399
If he hadn't been <i>captured...</i>

12:35.560 --> 12:38.791
...Zod could have stopped your father
from eviscerating the planet.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.838
My father destroyed Krypton?

12:42.040 --> 12:43.951
Billions of people died.

12:45.560 --> 12:49.473
But he made sure
his only son survived.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.711
All so that one day
you could conquer the human race...

12:56.600 --> 12:59.433
...and re-create Krypton on Earth.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.911
Why should I believe you?

13:04.160 --> 13:06.196
Believe what you will.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.316
My concern is for your mother's health.
I need to see her immediately.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.118
My wife needs medical attention.
You're obviously not a doctor.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.714
Make this easier on both of us,
and get out of my way.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.269
Dad, the doctors couldn't help.
Let him look at her.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.557
- It's been a day and a half since you fell?
- Yes. Exactly.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.392
Clark, go out and get the truck.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.279
Martha, I'm taking you
back to the hospital. Come on.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.635
The doctors can't treat her, Mr. Kent.
Trust me.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.156
If they puncture her skin or
use medication it could kill her instantly.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.357
- Why should I trust you?
- Because he's Kryptonian.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.594
- This could be a Kryptonian disease.
- Clark.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.437
- Mom? Mom?
- What's happening?

13:49.600 --> 13:52.160
She needs a meteor rock.
Do you have a meteor rock?

13:52.840 --> 13:55.115
- Dad, in the closet!
- Yeah.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.508
It's on the top shelf.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.113
Martha?

14:01.560 --> 14:03.710
Hold it to her forehead.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.236
Martha, Martha.
Breathe, Martha.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.470
That's it. It's me.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.154
It's working.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.595
In this case,
appearances are deceiving.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.471
There is no cure.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.473
The meteor will only help
ease her pain.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.315
- No.
- I'm sorry, Kal-EI.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.677
Within a matter of hours,
your Earth mother will be dead.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.914
Sweetheart.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.478
- Where are you going?
- To see Jor-EI.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.029
- Don't. He'll only feed you more lies.
- I don't care!

14:39.200 --> 14:40.792
Hey, wait a minute.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.872
Are you telling me
Jor-El is responsible for this?

14:48.080 --> 14:49.433
What's going on, clark?

14:52.360 --> 14:53.759
When Jor-El brought me back...

14:53.920 --> 14:57.151
...he warned me someone close to me
would have to die.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.949
So he is going after your mother.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.388
And why didn't you
tell me about this before?

15:03.560 --> 15:05.676
I didn't want you and Mom to worry.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.190
You're the only one that has a chance
of stopping this, so do something.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.591
I won't let him kill her.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.312
Don't.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.676
<i>Kal-EI, why have you come?</i>

15:36.840 --> 15:38.432
Please...

15:39.040 --> 15:40.712
...do whatever you want to me.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.757
Leave my mother alone!

15:42.920 --> 15:45.798
<i>I have caused your mother no harm.</i>

15:45.960 --> 15:48.520
No! Don't lie to me!

15:48.680 --> 15:50.955
If I'd have known
someone close to me would die...

15:51.120 --> 15:52.599
<i>...I'd</i> have given up my life.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.079
<i>It was you...</i>

15:54.240 --> 15:57.357
<i>... who chose to give up your powers</i>
<i>and turn your back on me.</i>

15:57.520 --> 15:59.715
Please let her live!

16:00.120 --> 16:02.475
<i>I am sorry, my son.</i>

16:03.000 --> 16:06.675
<i>The wheel of fate</i>
<i>has already been set in motion.</i>

16:07.160 --> 16:10.391
<i>Even you cannot alter destiny.</i>

16:28.400 --> 16:30.709
So, what am I looking at here?

16:31.320 --> 16:35.029
It started 48 hours ago, and it's been
continuing on and off since.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.599
What is it, a video glitch?

16:36.760 --> 16:39.228
More like an electromagnetic
tidal wave.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.868
- Good afternoon, Lex.
- Thank you.

16:42.040 --> 16:45.635
Dad, if you've come to dispense a dose
of political advice, save your breath.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.074
I know. I know, Lex.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.630
You have a cadre
of top-shelf professionals for that.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.677
I wonder...

16:53.280 --> 16:56.716
...do they know of the sorts of things
you keep hidden behind closed doors?

16:58.040 --> 17:01.077
You must be referring
to our deep, dark family secrets.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.151
Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.232
I'm talking about what you keep
in Warehouse 15.

17:08.680 --> 17:11.830
If you wanna make up stories,
you won't be the first.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.273
Just make it original.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.193
It's not your campaign
I'm worried about, it's your legacy.

17:16.359 --> 17:19.079
You don't want to end up an eccentric
like Howard Hughes...

17:19.240 --> 17:23.915
...remembered more for his 10-inch
toenails than his contributions to society.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.268
I'm afraid
you're the eccentric in the family, Dad.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.829
Yes, but I'm not the one
running for public office.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.912
Believe me, Lex,
the electorate has little patience...

17:33.080 --> 17:36.038
...for candidates
obsessed with little green men.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.637
It's time to get
your house in order, Lex.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.229
Where's my smile?

18:43.480 --> 18:46.790
Are you okay, Mom?
Can I get you anything?

18:49.680 --> 18:52.558
Your father told me
about Jor-EI, Clark.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.073
I want you to know...

18:55.240 --> 18:58.755
<i>...I'm</i> more than ready to give up my life
for the life of my child.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.116
Don't talk like that, Mom.

19:07.600 --> 19:12.151
You've given me
so much happiness, Clark.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.231
I don't know what I would've been
without you.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.876
Without me, none of this
would have happened.

19:23.040 --> 19:27.431
Don't ever feel guilty about this.
Do you hear me?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.554
I wouldn't have it any other way.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.990
You're gonna be fine.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.190
Look at you.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.155
You're a man now, clark.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.680
A wonderful man.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.872
My...

19:47.320 --> 19:49.470
My job is done.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.396
No, it's not, Mom.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.471
You can't say that.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.911
You have to fight this.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.997
I love you, Clark.

20:08.280 --> 20:13.559
And just because I'm <i>gone...</i>

20:14.960 --> 20:17.520
<i>...it</i> doesn't mean
my love goes with me.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.835
I will always be in your heart.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.274
Always.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.790
I'm not gonna let you die.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.312
I won't let you.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.198
Baby.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.479
I don't mean to stop the presses,
but I have a favor, Chlo.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.471
What else are cousins for? Shoot.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.712
You once mentioned that Lex Luthor
spent time in the cuckoo's nest.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.074
Why not write an exposé...

21:03.240 --> 21:05.993
...on the mental stability
of the great bald hope of Kansas?

21:06.160 --> 21:07.639
That would make a great story...

21:07.800 --> 21:10.997
...if I could find any shred of evidence
or a source that would talk.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.354
There has to be something.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.193
There's lots of sex, lies and videotapes
in Lex's vault.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.557
The problem is, he sleeps
with the key under his pillow.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.631
Why the sudden urge
to take down Lex?

21:20.800 --> 21:23.109
I'm just sick and tired
of rich powermongers...

21:23.280 --> 21:25.999
...who think they can win an election
with their checkbook.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.232
Not to mention the fact
that he called me a "muffin peddler."

21:29.400 --> 21:35.350
- Oh, so basically he hurt your feelings.
- Sort of. But that's beside the point.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.717
You have to have something
on that little hard drive of yours.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.717
Actually clark's professor at cKU was
doing some investigating on LuthorCorp.

21:47.920 --> 21:52.835
- Clark's professor?
- Yeah. He's writing a book.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.878
I actually followed him
to a LuthorCorp warehouse downtown.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.553
And what did you see?

21:57.720 --> 22:01.190
Nothing. Thanks to a little thing
called security, I couldn't get near it.

22:02.640 --> 22:06.918
Well, now you have your trusty sidekick
along for the ride.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.269
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.158
Let's go.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.758
- Hey.
- Maybe you can help me.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.036
I'm trying to find the highway
and I'm lost.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.031
Hold on. I got a map.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.399
Go.

22:49.360 --> 22:53.478
- You know, this is a really nice car.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

22:53.640 --> 22:58.031
You know, you can't fully appreciate
a car like this unless you sit in it.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.509
- Really?
- Come on. Yeah.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.194
- Okay.
- Just for a minute.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.588
Go ahead.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.513
Yeah.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.799
- Ready for this? It's amazing.
- Yeah.

23:14.960 --> 23:18.236
If you look there,
there's all sorts of really cool buttons.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.436
Okay, you have a pop-up thingy.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.115
Have a look. Yeah, you can put
things, like, I don't <i>know...</i>

23:24.600 --> 23:26.716
...breath mints and all sorts of stuff.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.749
Put coffee mugs.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.151
- How's the stereo?
- It's fantastic. Turn it up.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.709
And, yeah, well...

23:55.880 --> 23:58.678
You know,
I really gotta get back to work.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.596
Right. Okay.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.269
I love a man in uniform.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.554
Hey, how'd you get in here?

24:41.760 --> 24:44.228
Attention. Cobra Niner.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.832
<i>This is Three-four-niner, come in.</i>

24:49.280 --> 24:50.554
Hey.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.914
Thank you, Miss Andretti.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.514
Hold it!

25:21.760 --> 25:23.830
There's gotta be a way
to save my mom.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.359
There must be. I'll do anything.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.635
There is one option,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.398
What is it?

25:35.440 --> 25:36.953
No matter how malevolent he is...

25:37.120 --> 25:39.759
...Jor-El represents
your only connection with your past.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.554
Just tell me what it is.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.231
The only way to save your mother
is to destroy the Fortress.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.479
Jor-EI's will is controlling her virus
through the crystals.

25:50.640 --> 25:53.950
If you bring down his Fortress,
you will save your mother from his grip.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.720
All he's ever done
is try to ruin my life.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.798
Sadly, that was his legacy
on Krypton as well.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.551
I want him gone.

26:17.600 --> 26:21.912
If anyone is strong enough
to get through this...

26:22.880 --> 26:25.235
<i>...it's</i> you, sweetheart.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.311
You can't give up.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.390
You can't give up.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.354
I'll be right back.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.554
Mr. Kent, I'm so sorry,
but I have to find Clark.

26:44.760 --> 26:45.954
He's not here, chloe.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.998
- He's with his professor, is he?
- Yeah, they went to the cave.

26:49.560 --> 26:53.075
I've gotta get to him. Okay,
Milton Fine is not your ordinary Ph.D.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.430
I know about him.
He's trying to help Martha.

26:57.160 --> 27:00.277
I don't know how helpful
he's actually gonna be.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.079
I'll tear this place down
piece by piece.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.238
Just tell me where to start.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.158
Right here.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.312
Stab it into the console.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.431
It'll trigger
a self-destruct mechanism...

27:40.600 --> 27:44.149
...and Jor-El and his Fortress
will be forever gone.

27:44.360 --> 27:48.399
- What is it?
- It was created to defeat your father.

27:48.560 --> 27:51.870
But Zod was a man of peace.
He would only use it as a last resort.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.832
There was never a chance.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.358
There is now.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.598
You will never hurt my family again.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.315
I couldn't have done it without you.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.755
You're the only one
who could affect the Fortress.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.236
Now that you've accomplished your task,
you're just a petty annoyance.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.591
The meteor rock.
You're not even Kryptonian, are you?

28:27.800 --> 28:30.360
I was created by Kryptonians...

28:30.560 --> 28:33.757
<i>...but</i> I'm a whole lot smarter.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.713
You are free, General Zod.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.758
Zod?

28:42.600 --> 28:45.512
The one true Kryptonian.

28:45.720 --> 28:49.998
Finally he will rid this fertile planet
of the scourge of humans...

28:50.160 --> 28:52.833
...and create Krypton here on Earth.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.951
Everything you said to me was a lie.

28:55.160 --> 29:01.474
When you were talking about Jor-EI,
you really were talking about Zod.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.313
Jor-El didn't infect my mother, did he?
You did!

29:06.520 --> 29:09.717
To think that you would sacrifice
your Kryptonian heritage...

29:09.880 --> 29:11.950
...for a single <i>Homo sapien.</i>

29:12.160 --> 29:14.833
You are a pitiful disgrace.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.713
Goodbye, Kal-EI.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.598
Welcome to our new home,
General Zod.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.954
Clark?

29:33.440 --> 29:34.714
Clark?

30:35.880 --> 30:37.233
Chloe.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.190
Oh, my God!

31:55.720 --> 31:57.199
It's gone.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.549
Hey, you.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.513
Mom, you okay?

32:23.720 --> 32:27.315
Yeah. It's amazing how wonderful
a rainstorm smells...

32:27.480 --> 32:29.914
...after you think
you'll never smell one again.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.631
I can't imagine what it would be like
if you were gone.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.713
The hardest thing in life
is losing the people you love.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.389
But you'd learn to move on.
We all do.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.636
It wouldn't be easy.

32:48.160 --> 32:51.436
Dad's given me so much,
I could never measure it.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.390
But you're my heart. My soul.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.674
Well, I...

32:58.880 --> 33:02.316
I don't plan on going anywhere
for a long, long time.

33:03.680 --> 33:04.954
Good.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.949
You know, next time I head up north,
I've got to remember to pack a parka.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.832
How'd you get up there, anyway?

33:27.600 --> 33:30.239
You left your key in the cave.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.875
Seriously, Clark,
you've gotta be more careful.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.072
I mean, if I can get up there,
anyone can.

33:38.240 --> 33:41.437
You know, Professor Fine said
that human beings were insignificant...

33:41.600 --> 33:43.511
<i>...and</i> couldn't be depended on.

33:44.560 --> 33:48.553
- He obviously didn't know you very well.
- Please.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.275
Robo-professor knows as much
about human nature as R2-D2.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.311
What was he, anyway?

33:56.520 --> 33:59.034
I saw him materialize from a bunch of
nuts and bolts...

33:59.200 --> 34:00.918
...that spilled out of the spaceship.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.275
Some sort of Kryptonian
artificial intelligence.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.192
And what did he want with you?

34:05.680 --> 34:08.399
He wanted me to help him free
a rebel Kryptonian named Zod.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.553
What I still don't understand
is how you got onto Fine's trail.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.955
You're not gonna like this very much.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.350
Lionel Luthor gave me the lead.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.793
Lionel?

34:20.960 --> 34:23.757
- How'd he know about Fine?
- I have no clue.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.871
I hope he doesn't know
about the spaceship.

34:26.040 --> 34:29.429
You should get ahold of that thing
before somebody else beats you to it.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.873
There's a problem.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.469
I checked out that warehouse
you told me about. The ship's gone.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.234
Well, the master of the shell game
must have moved it.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.357
- Or...
- Or what?

34:41.120 --> 34:43.509
Or I have bigger problem
than I thought.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.437
Lex.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.319
Your message sounded urgent.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.277
You all right?

35:02.880 --> 35:05.599
I thought you were past
your kleptomania stage, Dad.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.034
But I guess old habits die hard.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.594
If you are accusing me
of some sort of thievery...

35:12.760 --> 35:17.038
...I assure you, son, I have no interest
in your little baubles and trinkets.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.515
You seemed interested
in what was in my warehouse.

35:19.920 --> 35:23.037
What'd you do? Pay off my security?
Bribe my scientists?

35:23.240 --> 35:27.313
You're telling me you misplaced
your most prized possession?

35:28.400 --> 35:30.994
Oh, Lex, Lex.
How many times have I told you.

35:31.160 --> 35:35.073
If you don't keep an eye on the things
you value, they will disappear.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.236
I want it back now!

35:37.400 --> 35:38.628
I wish I could oblige...

35:38.840 --> 35:42.389
...but, sadly, I had nothing to do
with this unfortunate heist.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.751
I don't know what happened to you
in that meteor shower, Dad.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.469
But you're more connected to what was
in that warehouse than I ever realized.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.638
Please be careful, Lex.
You're a fragile man.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.276
I don't wanna see you shattered again
by your delusions.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.272
Tell me you've managed to dig up
at least a speck of dirt on Lex.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.670
I'll take an unpaid parking ticket
at this point.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.350
I told you, Lex keeps his dirty laundry
in a cast-iron hamper.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.869
I might have done this at first
because of pride...

36:35.040 --> 36:36.712
...but then I started to worry...

36:36.960 --> 36:39.679
...what would Lex Luthor do
with the power of public office?

36:39.880 --> 36:41.871
He's gonna try to rule the world.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.873
- Lf you're that worried, do something.
- I plan to.

36:45.040 --> 36:48.749
But the one thing I plan on not doing
is poking around inside his warehouses.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.434
I can't believe after that
<i>Charlie's Angels</i> escapade...

36:51.600 --> 36:55.229
...all you found in there was fertilizer.
- It wasn't a complete waste of time.

36:55.400 --> 36:58.676
No? What did we manage to do
besides put a scratch on my new car?

36:58.840 --> 37:02.230
You got to experience
the chills and thrills of journalism.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.312
Thanks, but no, thanks.

37:04.480 --> 37:05.833
I don't know how you do it.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.912
Chasing story after story
that only leads to dead ends.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.553
I'd never be able to let go.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.271
That's usually how it starts.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.119
Hey.

37:40.280 --> 37:44.114
I know how hard all this has
been on you. How you holding up?

37:44.880 --> 37:47.519
I just don't know
how I could be so gullible.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.911
- I believed everything he said.
- I would've done the same thing, son.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.270
You were trying to save your mother.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.354
Luckily, she's safe now.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.637
I think the best thing we can do
is just put all this behind us...

37:59.800 --> 38:02.075
...and move on with our lives,
don't you?

38:02.240 --> 38:04.196
I'm not so sure.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.193
Jor-EI's warning is still out there.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.632
Clark...

38:13.760 --> 38:17.878
<i>...your</i> mother's virus was caused
by Fine, not by Jor-EI.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.599
He hasn't done anything yet.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.832
And for all we know,
he might never do anything.

38:23.040 --> 38:27.238
Dad, we both know that Jor-EI's
not the type to just let things go.

38:28.360 --> 38:33.480
Clark, when it comes down to it,
none of us are gonna be around forever.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.678
Now, we can't dwell on that.

38:35.880 --> 38:40.590
I think the trick is to just
live your life to its fullest.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.590
Make sure you spend as much time
as you possibly can...

38:45.800 --> 38:47.631
...with the people you love.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.679
You're right.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.998
Yeah.
