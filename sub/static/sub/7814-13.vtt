That Ronaldo can dazzle you
with his fancy physics bluster,

03:28.458 --> 03:31.250

he’s just a dirty cheater.

That’s so true.
Sorry.

Nah. You talk
too much already.

on their side.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.959
Four wheels and a box.

Word on the street says
you’re facing Ronaldo
on Mount Hurtsmore.

05:09.417 --> 05:11.959
I always thought the word
on the street said,
"PED XING."

Looks like you could use
some words of advice

05:14.083 --> 05:15.834

Oh, sorry.
I’ll clean later.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.291
Now listen up, boys.

05:29.291 --> 05:31.083
We gotta build you
a new cart.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.709
But there’s a couple things
you need to know first.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.959
Ronaldo plays by nobody’s
rules but his own.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.834
And he’s a cheater,
so he doesn’t play
by any rules.

05:43.834 --> 05:45.875
So forget everything
I just said.

05:45.875 --> 05:47.542
Except that he’s
a cheater.

05:49.542 --> 05:51.917
He veers left,
you veer right.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.875
He goes under,
you go over.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.250
He goes around,
you go through.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.959
He eats expired
cottage cheese, you--

05:58.959 --> 05:59.917
Well, you shouldn’t
do that.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.542
Gosh, that’s
a terrible idea.

06:01.542 --> 06:04.208
This is kind of
the worst advice ever.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.083
[hammering]
[ratcheting]

06:08.125 --> 06:09.709

you build a cart.

Awesome, Kick.
You’re ready.

06:12.917 --> 06:14.458

for Mount Hurtsmore.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.667

Okay,
so you’re not ready.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.750
Don’t get me wrong.
You’re as ready as
anyone’s ever been.

06:18.750 --> 06:21.166
But there’s one thing
nobody can teach you about,

06:21.166 --> 06:22.834

and that’s Turn 6.

06:22.834 --> 06:25.208

after I crashed that day.

you lost your eye?

subsonic aerodynamics.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.917
These wheels couldn’t withstand
even the slightest spinout.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.709
And your weight distribution
is so severely off-balance

07:21.709 --> 07:22.750
that it’s hilarious.

no science at work here.

so confident,

a little

that tonight’s my big
birthday party.

Sorry, Jackie.
I’d love to come,
but--

12:29.417 --> 12:30.667
Great!
It starts at 7.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.375

greatest daredevil

12:34.375 --> 12:36.166

12:47.333 --> 12:48.709
Because if you did,

12:48.709 --> 12:50.709
I can help you.
How?

her birthday party

to see you again.
