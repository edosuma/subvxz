No.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.034
Because I'm still here.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.838
[Grunting]

49:01.920 --> 49:03.513
They'll all know that you did this.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.398
Earl attacked you because
you got his son killed!

49:05.480 --> 49:06.436
[squeals]

49:06.520 --> 49:07.555
[Both grunt]

49:07.640 --> 49:10.712
You blamed me. You attacked me.

49:10.840 --> 49:13.116
And I defended myself.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.840
[Grunts]

49:15.920 --> 49:18.196
Gregory: [Groaning]

49:18.280 --> 49:19.429
[Grunts]

49:19.520 --> 49:22.080
[Panting]

49:30.640 --> 49:33.473
[Birds cawing]

49:33.560 --> 49:35.278
Carol: I'll see you soon.

49:36.960 --> 49:39.156
Give Henry a kiss for me.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.591
[Smooches]

49:44.680 --> 49:46.398
I'm not running away.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.949
It kind of feels like you are.

49:49.040 --> 49:50.155
If I pushed too hard--

49:50.240 --> 49:53.471
No. My friends need my help.

49:53.560 --> 49:57.110
And I want to be there for them.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.316
But I have a home I want to get back to,

49:59.400 --> 50:02.392
and that's enough for me for now.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.472
I hope it is for you, too.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.233
I'll be content

50:07.320 --> 50:11.359
to move at your speed, Lady Carol.

50:15.520 --> 50:17.557
[Grunts]

50:17.640 --> 50:20.280
Though the waiting
is such sweet sorrow.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.112
[Sighs]

50:22.200 --> 50:24.669
Jerry, our steeds.

50:24.760 --> 50:27.115
[Horse snorts]

50:27.200 --> 50:30.272
Jerry, take care of them for me,
just for a little bit.

50:30.360 --> 50:33.318
You got it, boss.

50:38.880 --> 50:41.679
[Horse snorts]

50:41.760 --> 50:43.558
[Hooves clopping]

50:47.600 --> 50:49.796
[Engine rumbling]

50:49.880 --> 50:52.076
[Hooves clopping]

50:59.480 --> 51:01.471
[Rumbling continues]

51:06.800 --> 51:08.120
[Engine shuts off]

51:08.200 --> 51:10.316
[Horse snorts]

51:13.760 --> 51:16.320
[Birds chirping]

51:16.400 --> 51:19.279
[Horse snorts]

51:21.800 --> 51:24.792
[Gravel crunching]

51:25.840 --> 51:28.400
[Horse sputters]

51:28.520 --> 51:30.670
[Birds chirping]

51:35.120 --> 51:36.918
It's funny.

51:37.000 --> 51:37.910
And he knows it.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.593
He's a little stinker.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.239
[Chuckles]

51:41.320 --> 51:43.550
He's just perfect.

51:43.640 --> 51:45.199
He really is.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.556
Yeah.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.074
I think I'll keep him.

51:50.640 --> 51:52.517
Come here.

51:57.480 --> 51:59.676
Okay. Here you go.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.793
[Baby cooing]

52:03.880 --> 52:05.871
Don't go running off.

52:05.960 --> 52:07.439
[Chuckles]

52:12.160 --> 52:13.878
Now that Hershel's a little older

52:13.960 --> 52:17.874
and you're going on runs again [Sighs]

52:17.960 --> 52:20.554
I'd love for you to visit
Alexandria sometime,

52:20.640 --> 52:23.871
if you're up for it.

52:23.960 --> 52:27.555
Judith talks about Aunt Maggie
at Hilltop all the time.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.153
[Sighs]

52:29.240 --> 52:32.073
I'm surprised she still
remembers you, but she does.

52:32.160 --> 52:34.515
Rick, I can't. You know I can't.

52:34.600 --> 52:37.831
[Sighs]

52:40.160 --> 52:42.276
But you came about something else.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.476
Oh.

52:44.560 --> 52:46.790
Maggie, it can-- it can wait.

52:46.880 --> 52:49.156
I'm okay.

52:49.240 --> 52:52.790
Just talk to me
about anything else, please.

52:52.880 --> 52:54.951
[Birds chirping]

52:55.040 --> 52:57.156
All right.

52:59.520 --> 53:02.751
Well...

53:02.840 --> 53:06.674
I need your help fixing the bridge.

53:06.760 --> 53:10.754
Hilltop's thriving because of you.

53:10.840 --> 53:13.275
This place is doing better
than anywhere else,

53:13.360 --> 53:16.876
and you've been generous.

53:16.960 --> 53:19.679
Hilltop's given so much already,

53:19.760 --> 53:22.639
but I'm asking for more.

53:22.760 --> 53:24.319
What?

53:24.400 --> 53:26.357
Sanctuary's still short on food,

53:26.440 --> 53:28.158
and a project like this is gonna take

53:28.240 --> 53:30.470
a lot of people and supplies.

53:30.600 --> 53:33.513
I'm asking if you'll be generous again,

53:33.600 --> 53:35.352
if you'll stretch.

53:38.600 --> 53:41.638
If my people want to work on the bridge,
I won't stop them.

53:44.720 --> 53:46.472
But no more food and supplies

53:46.560 --> 53:48.790
without getting something back for it.

53:48.880 --> 53:50.359
What do you want?

53:50.440 --> 53:55.719
If the Sanctuary needs food,
I'll give it to 'em.

53:55.800 --> 53:58.997
But... they provide

53:59.080 --> 54:03.313
most of the labor
on the bridge for us.

54:03.400 --> 54:04.879
And they send over all the fuel

54:04.960 --> 54:06.394
they've been making
from their dead corn.

54:06.480 --> 54:08.676
[Exhales sharply]

54:08.760 --> 54:11.036
S-Sanctuary's barely
holding on right now.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.554
We're obliged to help.

54:12.640 --> 54:16.076
Why? They surrendered.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.674
We didn't kill 'em.

54:18.760 --> 54:21.400
That's it.

54:21.480 --> 54:22.879
I can't solve all their problems

54:22.960 --> 54:25.076
when I clearly have
things to take care of here.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.589
Maggie, I'm so sorry
this happened to you and Enid--

54:29.680 --> 54:34.197
I've survived worse.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.873
But it has to stop.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.877
[Birds chirping]

54:50.640 --> 54:53.029
When we were fighting the Saviors,

54:53.120 --> 54:57.398
you told me that soon,
you'd be the one following me.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.794
But you didn't.

55:01.160 --> 55:03.754
'Cause I wasn't someone to follow.

55:05.480 --> 55:07.391
That changes now.

55:10.320 --> 55:12.709
[Baby cooing]

55:16.040 --> 55:18.077
It'll be dark soon.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.393
It's time to put the children to bed.

55:26.120 --> 55:28.953
[Windmill creaking, wind whistling]

55:31.520 --> 55:34.433
[Crickets chirping]

55:47.360 --> 55:51.513
[Sighs] I don't want to do this.

55:51.600 --> 55:54.194
But people need to understand
that at Hilltop,

55:54.280 --> 55:55.793
the punishment fits the crime.

55:58.440 --> 56:00.113
[Chirping continues]

56:07.200 --> 56:09.510
Do you have any final words?

56:11.720 --> 56:14.280
Gregory: [Whimpering]

56:17.440 --> 56:20.956
What you're doing isn't right.

56:21.040 --> 56:23.839
Somebody stop this, please.

56:23.920 --> 56:30.155
Killing me in the dead of night
because you're ashamed.

56:31.960 --> 56:34.793
You're wrong.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.473
I'm not ashamed.

56:42.720 --> 56:45.678
Stop this! Please!

56:45.760 --> 56:49.674
Now, for the love of God, stop it!

56:49.800 --> 56:52.314
[Breathing raggedly]

56:52.400 --> 56:54.073
- Maggie, stop!
- No, no!

56:54.160 --> 56:55.878
- Wait!
- Daryl: Ha!

56:55.960 --> 56:58.759
[Neck cracks, gasping]

56:58.840 --> 57:01.593
[Rope creaking, hooves clopping]

57:01.680 --> 57:03.193
Get the children back in bed.

57:09.600 --> 57:13.150
I made this decision.

57:13.280 --> 57:16.511
But this is not the beginning
of something.

57:16.600 --> 57:19.877
I don't want to go through it again.

57:19.960 --> 57:22.349
[Creaking continues]

57:22.440 --> 57:25.512
[Crickets chirping]

57:32.440 --> 57:34.511
Cut him down.

57:37.960 --> 57:39.712
[Knife scratching]

57:44.680 --> 57:46.114
-[Rope creaks, snaps]
-[Body thuds]
