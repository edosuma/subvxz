00:01.502 --> 00:05.106
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:05.139 --> 00:08.309
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.244
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.278 --> 00:11.712
and by the time I got here,

00:11.745 --> 00:16.016
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.386
I hid who I really was

00:18.419 --> 00:22.623
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.656 --> 00:26.094
To most people, I'm a reporter
at Catco Worldwide Media.

00:26.127 --> 00:29.630
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.663 --> 00:31.532
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.565 --> 00:34.368
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.569 --> 00:39.173
I am Supergirl.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.674
KARA: Previously
on Supergirl...

00:40.708 --> 00:42.576
SUPERGIRL:
Jeremiah helped us escape.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.977
You saw Dad?

00:44.011 --> 00:46.247
SUPERGIRL:
You're Hank Henshaw.
The real Hank Henshaw.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.282
Hank Henshaw is dead.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.818
I'm Cyborg Superman.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.321
About us not being a match,

00:53.354 --> 00:54.755
I didn't mean that.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.257
Nothing's stopping us.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.392
Nothing's stopping us.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.112
Good morning.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.481
Kara?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.551
Kara!

01:25.586 --> 01:27.255
Was it that bad?

01:29.623 --> 01:31.759
Was it that good?

01:31.792 --> 01:34.728
NEWSCASTER ON TV:
...and it's been
quite a morning for Supergirl.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.365
National City's own
feminist hero in a cape

01:37.398 --> 01:40.668
has already prevented
five armed robberies,

01:40.701 --> 01:42.035
delivered a litter of puppies,

01:42.069 --> 01:46.340
and given one very lucky
tugboat owner some extra help

01:46.374 --> 01:48.176
hauling a tanker.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.244
She's done a lot more than me.
(CHUCKLES)

01:51.579 --> 01:52.580
Morning.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.315
Hi.

01:54.348 --> 01:57.685
-I got you these.
-Oh! What a gentleman.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.487
Thank you.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.392
-Just hang on, one sec.
-Okay.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.163
(LAUGHS)

02:09.197 --> 02:10.398
Hi.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.266
(SIGHS)

02:12.966 --> 02:14.902
So, I...

02:14.935 --> 02:17.405
I had a really nice time.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.841
Yeah? Me, too.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.411
-Um, one note.
-Okay?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.946
I would like to wake up
next to you.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.748
-Oh?
-Yeah.

02:30.318 --> 02:34.222
Gosh, it's so nice to do that
without breaking
the guy's nose.

02:34.255 --> 02:37.725
-How many times
did that happen?
-Um...

02:37.758 --> 02:40.361
-Less than five.
-So four?

02:40.394 --> 02:43.197
-(LAUGHS)
-Exactly four times.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.871
Hey, so, since you got your
little superhero-ing out of
the way for the day,

02:50.904 --> 02:54.208
can we maybe just stay here?

02:54.242 --> 02:56.744
-Hmm?
-Oh, gosh, I really...

02:56.777 --> 02:58.712
-I... Oh, no...
-Yes. Yes.

02:58.746 --> 03:03.717
No, no, no,
'cause we have to be
at the DEO in like 20 minutes.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.720
-Boo!
-I know, I know.

03:06.754 --> 03:11.292
Speaking of which, um,
can we just keep this quiet?

03:11.325 --> 03:12.593
What you...

03:12.626 --> 03:15.296
-You don't want
people to know?
-No, no, I do.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.797
It's not that. It's just...

03:17.665 --> 03:18.466
Just for now.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.635
'Cause the last time
I liked someone,

03:21.669 --> 03:26.574
everyone in my life
watched and commented on it.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.510
And I just really
don't want that
to happen to us.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.380
Hmm.
So there's an "us"?

03:32.413 --> 03:35.015
-Yeah.
-Yeah? I like that.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.417
(CHUCKLES)

03:38.819 --> 03:40.254
Well, okay.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.023
We can keep it quiet.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.759
Hey, everybody!
Uh, quick thing.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.362
Kara and I are dating.
Yes, it's awesome.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.464
Yes, we are very happy.

03:50.498 --> 03:53.634
And your jealousy
is appropriate.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.637
You can carry on now.
Thank you. Sorry.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.339
-Ten seconds.
-Yeah, I thought that was...

03:58.372 --> 04:00.641
You lasted...
We just walked in.
It was 10 seconds.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.843
...very, very short.
I'm sorry,
I couldn't help myself.

04:02.876 --> 04:06.380
I mean, back on Daxam,
they used to throw parties
when people got together.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.648
You're lucky
I didn't arrange a parade.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.883
-Ha ha!
-I'm just saying.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.321
Can we just pretend
like that never happened?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.555
I'd like nothing more.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.457
But unfortunately,
as your supervisor,

04:16.490 --> 04:18.559
I have to ask you
to report to HR.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.593
(LAUGHS)

04:21.529 --> 04:22.830
Wait, you're serious?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.365
Kara, you're dating
a co-worker.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.600
That's not...
Wait, we have an HR?

04:26.634 --> 04:28.068
Walk this puppy
down to the second floor

04:28.101 --> 04:31.972
and fill out all the forms
Pam gives you in triplicate.

04:32.005 --> 04:36.076
Oh, and you're gonna
have to attend a mandatory
sexual harassment seminar.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.511
Seriously?

04:39.480 --> 04:41.415
It's going to be a rough
sparring session for me.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.550
-You think?
-Okay, I'm gonna warm up.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.052
-(BEEPING)
-Holy Cadmus cream egg.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.921
Cadmus? They've been dark
since Lillian broke out
of prison.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.591
Uh, well, they are back
and with a vengeance.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.728
We've got a convoy coming out
from one of their suspected
weapon storage facilities

04:54.762 --> 04:56.830
Tell Alex and Mon-El
to set up a back-up team.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.500
-You going alone?
-Nope. I'm taking
the other fly guy.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.436
Teamwork makes the dream work.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.559
I can't see inside.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.528
(GUNS FIRING)

05:40.040 --> 05:41.642
(TIRES SQUEAL)

05:44.912 --> 05:46.414
Cover me!

06:16.444 --> 06:18.979
(CREAKING)

06:19.012 --> 06:20.714
(TIRES SCREECHING)

06:31.024 --> 06:33.026
(GRUNTS)

06:37.097 --> 06:38.966
Oh, my God.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.468
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

06:48.476 --> 06:50.177
They told me
but I didn't believe it.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.046
Alex. My Alex. Ow.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.850
(CHUCKLING)

06:59.587 --> 07:00.754
Okay.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.826
(SLOW CLAPPING)

07:10.631 --> 07:13.767
I don't know how long
we were rotting out there
in the Amazon, but...

07:15.068 --> 07:17.871
I came to at Cadmus.

07:17.905 --> 07:22.242
They saved me,
so I could save Henshaw.

07:22.275 --> 07:26.480
They forced me
to keep him alive,
to enhance him.

07:26.514 --> 07:29.683
Physically turn him into
the monster he was beneath.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.621
It is strange

07:33.654 --> 07:35.489
seeing you in Henshaw's skin.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.157
I hope I've put it
to good use.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.626
Better than he ever did.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.093
SUPERGIRL:
But what happened after that?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.195
You were gone
for such a long time.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.665
I guess I did too good a job
enhancing Henshaw,

07:44.698 --> 07:46.767
'cause Cadmus wanted me
to stick around,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.169
help 'em with other projects.

07:49.202 --> 07:52.072
In the beginning,
I tried to escape
again and again.

07:52.105 --> 07:56.744
But, well, let's just say
they didn't appreciate
that very much.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.613
(SIGHS) Oh, Dad. I...

07:59.647 --> 08:01.181
It's okay, by...

08:01.214 --> 08:04.117
By working with them,
I was helping to keep you

08:04.151 --> 08:05.586
and your sister safe.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.820
(DOOR OPENS)

08:06.854 --> 08:08.656
I came as soon as I heard.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.825
Mon-El of Daxam.
We meet again.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.661
I'm glad you're okay.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.963
I was worried
after you let us out
that Cadmus was gonna...

08:15.996 --> 08:18.666
Cadmus would imprison
and torture me
for betraying them?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.133
Yeah, well, you'd be right.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.804
Dad, the uh,

08:23.837 --> 08:28.542
the damage to your hand is...
It's extensive.

08:28.576 --> 08:33.080
It's a punishment for helping
Mon-El and Kara escape.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.816
But I would do it again,
in a heartbeat.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.687
I'm so lucky you found me.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.855
I'm so lucky to be back
with you two.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.058
Well, it's more than luck.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.126
What do you mean?

08:46.159 --> 08:48.228
We got an alert that Cadmus
was moving a weapon,

08:48.261 --> 08:50.831
and we don't get alerts
unless they're releasing
a video

08:50.864 --> 08:52.132
or we catch them red-handed.

08:52.165 --> 08:55.102
But we did catch them
red-handed.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.739
Though... No, they were waving
their red hands
around in the air

08:58.772 --> 09:00.808
literally like
they just didn't care.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.110
-No...
-JEREMIAH: No,
Mon-El is right.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.879
You need to keep
your guard up.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.715
'Cause Cadmus
does have a weapon.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.149
What is it?

09:09.182 --> 09:11.885
A nuclear fusion bomb.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.320
They're going to
destroy National City,

09:13.353 --> 09:15.623
and blame it
on hostile aliens.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.924
How did Cadmus
get their hands on it?

09:16.957 --> 09:20.127
Well, they didn't steal it.
They built it.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.362
Using the radiation they mined
from your heat vision

09:22.395 --> 09:23.897
when you were
in their custody.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.067
(SCREAMS)

09:27.701 --> 09:28.969
Oh, my God.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.710
LILLIAN:
When will the device be ready?

09:41.281 --> 09:44.117
Right... Now.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.258
The DEO and Supergirl

09:51.291 --> 09:53.761
won't be able
to stop us this time.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.267
So, what you're telling me
is that Jeremiah Danvers,

10:00.300 --> 10:03.070
former DEO agent
and Alex and Kara's
long lost father

10:03.103 --> 10:05.072
has returned from
Cadmus custody with news

10:05.105 --> 10:08.642
that our enemy has developed
a nuclear fusion explosive

10:08.676 --> 10:10.944
using Kara's other-worldly
heat vision radiation,

10:10.978 --> 10:15.148
and that they're going to
drop that on National City
and just kill us all?

10:15.182 --> 10:18.786
Ha! Is... Is this...
Is this place bomb-proof?

10:18.819 --> 10:22.089
You could run a trace
on Kara's heat vision
radiation signature.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.991
Right, yeah well,
if the bomb is armed,

10:24.024 --> 10:26.126
then yes, I might be
able to pinpoint

10:26.159 --> 10:28.261
its location
before it goes off.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.963
Good, get to work, Winn.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.201
Jeremiah!

10:36.403 --> 10:37.771
Eliza.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.911
-Oh, my God.
-(GROANS)

10:43.944 --> 10:45.879
My God, did I miss you?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.990
Hey, Kara,
can I talk to you
for a second?

10:57.390 --> 10:58.726
Yeah.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.060
What's up?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.796
Look, I know you're happy
he's back.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.865
-Are you not?
-I... (SIGHS)

11:04.898 --> 11:06.867
-He saved us.
-Yes. Exactly.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.002
I was there and I...
I watched you solar flare,

11:09.036 --> 11:12.139
and it didn't look like
they were trying to, you know,
capture your heat-vision.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.708
It looked like
they just wanted you
to blow your powers out.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.476
Mon-El.
You are not a scientist.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.979
And you don't know
how that Cadmus device worked,

11:19.012 --> 11:20.881
but Jeremiah does.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.750
Why is it so hard
for you to trust him?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.785
-Why is it so easy for you?
-Because he's always
protected me,

11:24.818 --> 11:26.086
at great cost.

11:26.119 --> 11:30.123
He also lived
with your enemy for years.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.159
They... They forced him
to keep Henshaw alive.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.162
What makes you think that
they're not forcing Jeremiah
to do something now?

11:35.195 --> 11:37.898
I know you're just trying
to look out for us.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.934
-For me.
-Mmm-hmm.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.270
But he needs us right now.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.906
Please.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.076
Okay.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.313
-Okay. Okay.
-Thank you.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.185
-We're having a family dinner
to celebrate his return.
-Yeah?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.788
Just come over
and get to know him.

12:00.821 --> 12:05.125
Spend time with him
and you will see that there's
nothing to be afraid of.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.227
At all.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.933
Jeremiah's return
isn't an "accidental gift."

12:12.966 --> 12:15.135
It's just a gift.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.004
And we should be
happy about it.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.443
The last time
I saw you two set a table,

12:23.476 --> 12:25.145
it was only after
we took your phones away.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.114
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.381
Yeah, we were perfect angels.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.150
Oh, really?
That's the party line?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.252
I seem to recall
a lot of grumbling.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.254
-(KNOCKING)
-Well, times have
changed, Dad.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.857
Yes, we have embraced
being helpful.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.526
On scales
both large and small.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.195
-Hey.
I heard there was a party.
-Come on in.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.833
Hey, um... Come in.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.868
-Hey, sweetie.
-Um...

12:47.901 --> 12:51.138
Dad, this is
my girlfriend, Maggie.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.041
Things have changed.

12:56.944 --> 13:00.280
There is no man on Earth
good enough for Alex Danvers.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.916
So it would have to be
someone like you.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.052
Oh, flattery. (LAUGHS)

13:05.085 --> 13:07.220
And you're right.
Alex deserves the best.

13:08.388 --> 13:12.525
Oh! And you brought...
Tequila.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.327
Okay, she's family.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.396
(CHUCKLES) You wanna
show the kids how
margaritas are done?

13:16.429 --> 13:18.231
-Let's do it.
-All right.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.868
(KNOCKING)

13:20.901 --> 13:22.302
(EXHALES)

13:22.335 --> 13:24.905
On a scale
of one to crazy happy,
how crazy happy are you?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.406
I can't even. You?

13:26.439 --> 13:29.142
I mean, sometimes I can even.
But right now I cannot even.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.582
Hi! How are you?

13:35.615 --> 13:37.017
(WHISPERING) Was I supposed
to wear a tie?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.318
-No.
-Okay.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.588
-Dr. Danvers! And Dr. Danvers!
-(CHUCKLES)

13:41.621 --> 13:43.056
That's a knife.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.959
-Don't shake your knife.
-Hello, sweet boy.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.062
JEREMIAH: Oops! (LAUGHS)

13:49.096 --> 13:51.031
-It's harder, one-handed.
-Here, let me.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.169
(SIGHS)

13:59.172 --> 14:01.108
Fourteen years with Cadmus,

14:01.141 --> 14:03.243
this is all I ever
thought about. Right here.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.547
Look at our girls.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.118
(LAUGHING)

14:12.085 --> 14:13.253
Thank you, Lizzie.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.125
I'm so sorry...

14:19.259 --> 14:21.228
That I wasn't here.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.896
It's going to be
different now.

14:22.930 --> 14:26.967
We can make up for lost time.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.235
No.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.637
It's not possible.
That time, it's gone.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.305
What do you mean?

14:32.339 --> 14:34.641
I mean that I love you and
I have missed you every day.

14:34.674 --> 14:38.478
But I don't know you anymore
and you don't know me.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.417
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.955
But this is going to
have to be something new.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.523
I think we're just
going to have to
learn each other again.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.660
Do you think we can do that?

14:56.196 --> 14:58.298
Let's just start with dinner.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.433
Okay?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.172
Kids! Drinks are ready!

15:05.205 --> 15:06.406
All right!

15:08.175 --> 15:09.409
JEREMIAH: Here we go.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.311
-Let me help.
-Ah, thank you.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.280
So sorry I'm late.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.348
Oh, don't be silly, J'onn.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.251
Oh, hey! I forgot
to do something earlier.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.154
Oh!

15:21.188 --> 15:23.290
Thank you.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.958
Thank you for
saving my life again.

15:24.992 --> 15:28.461
Thank you for
keeping your promise
to watch over my girls.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.529
It was an honor.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.664
KARA: A toast.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.100
To coming home.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.502
ALL: Coming home.

15:39.706 --> 15:44.177
Now, obviously,
this is going to be
a time of adjustment.

15:44.211 --> 15:47.747
But I hope
you'll all be patient with me.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.451
I've seen and done things
that I wish I hadn't.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.885
Dad, don't.

15:52.919 --> 15:56.689
No, sweetie.
If I'm going to move forward,
I can't ignore my past.

15:56.723 --> 16:00.327
Cadmus... Changed me,
they tried to break me.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.230
But in the process,
they made me dangerous.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.664
I know their weaknesses,

16:05.532 --> 16:06.599
and I'm here...

16:06.633 --> 16:09.602
To work with all of you
to make our planet safer.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.073
So, if you'll
have me, Director,

16:13.106 --> 16:15.642
I'd like to return to the DEO.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.676
Formally.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.411
J'onn? Can he?

16:21.048 --> 16:24.551
Pending a full
psych evaluation
and a field readiness exam...

16:27.387 --> 16:29.656
We'll give you
the tour tomorrow.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.624
-Thank you, friend.
-All right.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.497
I'm in the DEO for two months
before I can pee alone,

16:37.530 --> 16:39.266
and he just walks
right back in?

16:39.299 --> 16:42.235
Say something nice to him.
Now.

16:45.338 --> 16:49.309
(CLEARS THROAT) I just wish
you were coming back
at a time of peace, sir.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.044
We all do.

16:51.078 --> 16:55.515
What a lucky thing
that you have returned
when you did.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.218
You mean when he was rescued,
right, Mon-El?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.189
Um...

17:02.222 --> 17:04.191
I mean,
that it is very fortunate

17:04.224 --> 17:05.792
that Dr. Danvers has returned

17:05.825 --> 17:08.295
just as a fusion bomb
has become a threat.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.829
A fusion bomb
that only he's mentioned

17:09.862 --> 17:11.098
and no one else has seen.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.299
I mean, what a gift.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.101
What did you just say
to my father?

17:14.134 --> 17:16.603
MON-EL: And now
he's just gonna go
right back to the DEO.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.339
With full access,
I'm guessing, right, J'onn?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.241
No background checks
for your old soldier buddy.

17:21.274 --> 17:24.277
-You need to back up.
-Why don't you just let him
right back in?

17:24.311 --> 17:25.412
What?

17:25.445 --> 17:27.314
Why are you pushing me?

17:27.347 --> 17:29.282
So, we're just gonna
give him free rein?

17:29.316 --> 17:31.251
Why is... Why is no one
questioning this?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.453
-Is that not crazy?
-If your father walked through
that door right now,

17:33.486 --> 17:36.189
after all these years
that you thought he was dead,
what would you do?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.590
I would run.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.527
-Run?
-Because he was
not a good man.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.295
So...

17:42.329 --> 17:43.630
You know what?
I'm sorry about that.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.266
But this is not about you
and your suspicion,

17:46.299 --> 17:48.401
and your disrespect
are out of line.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.702
And you need to leave my home.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.603
-Kara...
-No.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.339
-That's the...
-No, no!

17:52.372 --> 17:54.607
You've ignored what I need
from moment one today.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.644
I asked for privacy and time
and you ignored that.

17:57.677 --> 18:00.613
And I asked you
to give Jeremiah
the benefit of the doubt

18:00.647 --> 18:02.749
and you ignored that too.
So I don't...

18:02.782 --> 18:04.284
Okay, okay, hey!

18:04.317 --> 18:07.520
I'm sorry.
That is two strikes on me,

18:07.554 --> 18:10.123
okay, but let's just...
Let's let it go...

18:10.157 --> 18:12.759
(LAUGHS) I am not baseball.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.828
And unless you learn
that what I say counts,

18:15.862 --> 18:17.297
this isn't going to work.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.605
-Why don't I show you out?
-I think that's
a really good idea.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.110
Okay, I was
heading out, anyway.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.596
Sir, as a scientist,
you have to believe
in questioning.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.164
That's all I was trying
to do in there.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.832
-I'm sorry if I hurt you...
-I know who you are.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.603
And?

18:57.704 --> 18:58.738
That's it.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.374
I know who you are.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.510
And I doubt
Kara would like the truth.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.748

IN THE BACKGROUND)

19:11.518 --> 19:12.719
(DOOR SHUTS)

19:16.723 --> 19:18.191
Hey.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.392
-For you.
-Ooh!

19:19.426 --> 19:20.593
Perfect timing.
Thanks for coming.

19:20.627 --> 19:21.861
Always happy to grab a drink,

19:21.894 --> 19:23.763
but you do realize
we're like kind of in

19:23.796 --> 19:25.632
all-hands-on-deck
situation right now?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.568
You know, trying to
track down that fusion

19:28.601 --> 19:29.469
b-o-m-b.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.803
Very discrete.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.038
Yeah. And speaking of...

19:32.071 --> 19:35.608
What's so top secret that you
can't talk to me at the DEO?

19:35.642 --> 19:36.676
Um...

19:38.378 --> 19:40.480
It's Jeremiah's return.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.682
What if... What if
Cadmus allowed us

19:42.715 --> 19:45.352
to "rescue" Jeremiah
so he could sabotage us?

19:45.385 --> 19:48.455
Just when this,
this doomsday bomb is
about to be detonated.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.290
-I mean, think about it.
-Okay. You know what...

19:50.323 --> 19:52.459
I knew I shouldn't have
given you my Netflix password.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.494
Because watching
that much 24 at once

19:54.527 --> 19:55.895
is not healthy, I told you.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.731
I... I... I'm not being
paranoid here, Winn.
I'm not.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.401
When... When is the last time
we were this lucky?

20:01.434 --> 20:04.737
Lucky enough that
Cadmus was moving
their most valuable prisoner,

20:04.771 --> 20:07.274
a guy that the DEO
has been unable to find

20:07.307 --> 20:08.675
for over 15 years?

20:09.876 --> 20:12.412
And he just... He just
lands in our lap?

20:12.445 --> 20:14.281
So, you think Jeremiah is...

20:14.314 --> 20:17.317
It's just... He is somebody
that we need to

20:17.350 --> 20:19.286
keep our guard
up around.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.954
At least until we know exactly
what he's has been doing

20:21.988 --> 20:23.590
for the past 15 years.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.593
Yeah. Okay. I'll help you.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.262
Are you... Really?

20:29.296 --> 20:31.531
-Hey, thank you.
-Yeah, yeah.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.999
You're a good friend.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.834
-I know.
-(CHUCKLES)

20:34.867 --> 20:38.438
You... You realize
now that you...

20:38.471 --> 20:39.972
That you owe me
a favor in return.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.575
Anything.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.843
Just be good to her.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.246
I will.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.884
Hey. I didn't think we were
meeting until a little later.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.020
Hey you. Yeah, I'm just

20:54.053 --> 20:55.722
catching up my friend, Mon-El.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.390
-Mmm-hmm?
-Hmm.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.691
Pleasure to meet you.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.560
And you.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.729
I'll see you tonight.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.831
-Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:04.864 --> 21:05.898
Oh.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.712
JEREMIAH: You really turned
this place around.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.881
I can't take the credit.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.050
For years I was afraid
of real change,

21:24.083 --> 21:27.720
of revealing my true identity
through pro-alien action.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.856
Your daughters
helped me with it.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.724
They demanded
we all be better.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.461
I owe them a great deal.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.995
Don't sell yourself
short, J'onn.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.064
It's easy for the young
to demand change.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.932
And you were open to it.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.067
You did your part.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.736
A lot of lives are going
to be better because of you.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.006
What did I say?

21:47.039 --> 21:49.609
You were the first human
to treat me as an equal.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.044
Knowing who I really was.

21:52.078 --> 21:55.448
I didn't think that I'd ever
see you again, my friend.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.385
Don't tell the girls, but
I'm happy to see you, too.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.586

22:08.395 --> 22:10.763
report to the Med Bay.
Familiarize yourself with
the equipment there.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.065
I gotta go check on
the hunt for the fusion bomb.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.367
See you there, afterwards.

Yes. Give me...
Just...

22:49.001 --> 22:50.437
If this is what
I think it is...

22:50.470 --> 22:52.439
No. Nope. Turn around.

and we think you should
know about it.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.446
Okay.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.847
Okay. So, earlier today,

23:00.880 --> 23:02.882
J'onn's giving Jeremiah
a tour of the facility.

23:02.915 --> 23:06.586

J'onn stepped away,

into the DEO mainframe...

23:13.493 --> 23:15.795
Were you spying on Jeremiah?

23:15.828 --> 23:17.129
-MON-EL: Kara...
-Did you put him up to this?

23:17.163 --> 23:18.665
You are not listening!

23:18.698 --> 23:21.701
-Winn found something.
-A "big" something.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.737
-What?
-He actually broke in to
the DEO system.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.707
-(WHISPERS) Too loud.
-(WHISPERS) I'm sorry.
But it sure as hell looks like

23:27.740 --> 23:29.909
Jeremiah is spying on us.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.050
Still no ping on
the fusion bomb?

23:38.084 --> 23:39.552
Uh, no. Nothing.

23:39.586 --> 23:43.189
Is it possible they could
have developed some
sort of cloaking device?

23:43.222 --> 23:46.459
No, no. They would have needed
me to build it for them.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.495
Keep scanning.
It'll come online eventually.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.997
Hey, Jeremiah...

23:52.499 --> 23:53.800
Can we talk for a minute?

23:54.266 --> 23:56.235
Sure. What's up?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.737
Is everything okay?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.240
Um...

24:01.273 --> 24:04.577
Earlier today, you accessed
some highly classified files

24:04.611 --> 24:06.212
from the DEO mainframe.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.680
That's true. I did.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.782
Why?

24:09.816 --> 24:13.820
I tried to use my old passkey
to look at some case files.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.522
But the access codes
have changed,

24:15.555 --> 24:17.123
so I did a workaround

24:17.924 --> 24:18.958
to get inside.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.560
What were you looking at?

24:20.593 --> 24:22.729

24:23.129 --> 24:25.665

24:25.698 --> 24:29.168

had been up to.

24:54.827 --> 24:59.098

I mean, looks like it's just
a bunch of old case files.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.833
(SIGHS) Oh, Dad.

something else.

and scared as you are.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.231
I share the same feelings.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.566
But I also...

25:34.166 --> 25:35.935
See clearly now.

25:36.903 --> 25:40.773
Jeremiah was with Cadmus
a long time.

25:40.807 --> 25:43.009
We've never faced
an enemy more dangerous.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.277
We owe it to ourselves

25:45.311 --> 25:47.814
to look at every angle,

25:47.847 --> 25:49.782
even if it makes us
uncomfortable.

-You sound just like him.

-(MUMBLES)
-Look, I realize that you're
in your honeymoon phase,

25:56.355 --> 25:58.324
but really, Kara,

25:58.357 --> 26:01.928
I mean, you don't
have to take every
stance that he takes.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.263
I'm not and this isn't
about Mon-El,

26:04.296 --> 26:05.832
this is about the truth.

26:05.865 --> 26:09.602
And the truth is that
Jeremiah breaking into
the DEO computer system is...

26:10.369 --> 26:11.303
It's weird.

26:11.337 --> 26:15.675
He missed out on over
a decade as our father.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.944
I don't blame him for wanting
to catch up,

26:17.977 --> 26:20.279
-however he can.
-Then why not just ask us?

26:20.312 --> 26:21.848
We're right here.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.650
He spent an hour
with J'onn today...

26:23.683 --> 26:25.985
Why wait until he's
alone to access the system?

26:26.018 --> 26:27.754
Kara, you really don't trust
him, do you?

26:27.787 --> 26:30.089
No, I don't trust Cadmus.

26:30.122 --> 26:34.093
And I'll do what I have to,
to protect us.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.395
Well, I guess, you've
chosen your side.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.197
This is not about sides.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.733
No. It is.

26:40.767 --> 26:44.303
Because either you're a part
of this family or you're not.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.005
-You don't mean that.
-He's my father.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.274
-He's mine, too.

How could you?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.927
How could you?

35:28.960 --> 35:31.263
Would you believe me if
I said I did it for you?

35:33.332 --> 35:35.367
You betrayed everyone

35:35.401 --> 35:37.269
at the DEO.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.438
(GASPS) Your friends.

(SHAKILY) Our family,

35:41.907 --> 35:43.375

(SOBS)

35:48.747 --> 35:50.316
You did that for me?

35:50.349 --> 35:51.783
Family's complicated, honey.

35:54.553 --> 35:55.754
I'm bringing you in.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.257
Not alive, you're not.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.158
-(SOBS)
-If you want to bring me in...

36:01.493 --> 36:02.694
You're gonna have to shoot me.

(GASPS)

36:07.399 --> 36:08.567
If you do it...

36:09.468 --> 36:10.669
I'll understand.

You are always
the best part of me.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.708

over to you. Okay.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.643
Hey, hey, hey. Any luck?

36:52.344 --> 36:53.379
We lost.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.514
I'm sorry, guys.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.715
Yeah.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.251
On your feet already?

36:59.285 --> 37:00.352
No time to waste.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.954
Any idea what
he stole from us?

37:02.988 --> 37:04.790
-What he gave to Cadmus?
-Not yet.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.692
Now, I have to go check down
on the mainframe and then

37:06.725 --> 37:09.027
once we get
the systems back online,
I can run a diagnostic...

37:09.060 --> 37:11.497
Quick as you can.
I want to know
what we're up against.

37:11.530 --> 37:12.731
Yes, sir.

How are you both?

Excuse me.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.677
(GASPS) I heard what
your father did.

What're you thinking?

37:28.814 --> 37:30.782
(SIGHS) I'm...

37:32.584 --> 37:34.286
Just worried.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.422
I'm worried about what
this means for Alex,

37:36.455 --> 37:38.357
for me, for...

37:38.390 --> 37:40.492
Jeremiah and Eliza,

37:40.526 --> 37:41.960
for our fight
against Cadmus.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.365
I'm just worried it's going
to change everything.

37:47.633 --> 37:48.800
It will.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.437
It will make us stronger.

tell me anything.

Why don't you tell me
what you need?

Winn, did you figure out
what Jeremiah stole
from the DEO computers?

It's not good, Kara.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.399
(GASPS)

Cadmus has the list of
all the aliens in the country.

Jeremiah.

Yes, we do.
