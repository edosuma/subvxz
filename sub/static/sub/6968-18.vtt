00:30.906 --> 00:32.824
OK, OK.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.997
OK.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.433
¿ Qué pasa aquí?

01:24.001 --> 01:26.044
¡Santa María!

01:38.348 --> 01:40.642
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.479
Hey, get out of the way!

01:44.605 --> 01:45.898
Hey, move!

01:50.777 --> 01:53.447
Ray's hurt bad, man.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.909
Hurry up! Get an ambulance!

01:57.910 --> 02:00.454
This is Wesley Brewer out on route seven.

02:00.495 --> 02:04.041
Looks like about an eight o'clock ETA
on that trailer pick-up.

02:04.166 --> 02:09.378
- This fog's gonna slow me down.
- 10-4, Wesley. See you when you get here.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.590
Mother of God!

02:43.539 --> 02:46.834
Mom, is it gonna die?

02:53.841 --> 02:56.969
She was just lying there
when we found her, Officer.

<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 18 - Fearful Symmetry

04:23.847 --> 04:26.308
So you saw nothing when the window broke?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.768
- No.
- Nothing.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.562
We heard a noise, like thunder.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.857
Then glass everywhere.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.193
OK. Thank you.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.863
- What'd the janitors say?
- They claim they didn't see anything.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.575
The security monitors don't have
a recording of anything either.

04:43.659 --> 04:47.204
Just a giant implosion of glass
like some kind of giant shock wave.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.040
What they described
sounds more like a sonic boom.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.626
Well, no sonic boom did this.

04:54.044 --> 04:58.632
The construction worker who was killed
had his spine crushed like a string of shells.

04:58.715 --> 05:03.345
A circular abrasion on his torso in
roughly the shape of an elephant's foot.

05:03.428 --> 05:08.267
Other workers said they felt the ground
shake, then a faint whiff of animal odour.

05:08.559 --> 05:13.188
If you still think the elephant did this,
it defies logic. Somebody would have seen it.

05:13.272 --> 05:16.733
Well, if somebody would have seen it,
Scully, we wouldn't be here.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.152
Another vehicle would have left evidence -

05:19.236 --> 05:22.781
distress to the metal or paint.
I can see signs of neither.

05:22.865 --> 05:27.035
I'd admit the possibility of a tornado,
but it's not really tornado season.

05:27.119 --> 05:31.039
I'd even entertain the notion
of a black hole passing over the area...

05:31.123 --> 05:35.210
...or some cosmic anomaly, but it's
not really black-hole season either.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.755
If I was a betting man,
I'd say that it was, um...

05:38.839 --> 05:40.716
An invisible elephant?

05:40.799 --> 05:44.261
I saw David Copperfield make
the Statue of Liberty disappear.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.471
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.433
Ed Meecham, Fairfield Zoo.
Sorry for the hold-up.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.186
We had trouble transporting Ganesha's body.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.104
- This is Agent Scully.
- Hi.

05:54.396 --> 05:59.151
- Have they determined what he died of?
- She. She was a 12-year-old Indian female.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.904
I figure she ran herself into exhaustion.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.781
- How did she escape?
- Well, now, there's a puzzle.

06:04.865 --> 06:09.745
When I got the call, I expected to find her
cage open, but it was locked, just like I left it.

06:09.828 --> 06:14.791
- Any idea how she could have escaped?
- No, sir. No signs of tampering either.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.587
I've read about something called
"the elephant rebellion" in zoos.

06:18.670 --> 06:22.007
Elephants turning on their keepers,
destroying their pens.

06:22.090 --> 06:27.262
- Was Ganesha ever a problem like that?
- Elephants are very big, very wilful animals.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.515
So you're saying there were problems?

06:29.598 --> 06:32.768
The person you wanna talk to
about that is Willa Ambrose.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.770
- Ambrose?
- She's a naturalist.

06:34.853 --> 06:38.649
She was hired by the board of supervisors
last year to oversee things.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.193
She's supposed to be the reigning authority.

06:41.276 --> 06:46.240
In your opinion, the damage here, could this
have been caused by an escaped elephant?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.408
My honest opinion? Sure.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.245
Excuse me.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.835
- What you looking for, Mulder?
- A local paper.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.046
I wanna see if David Copperfield's in town.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.312
Excuse me. We're looking for Willa Ambrose.

07:17.396 --> 07:20.065
- There.
- Thank you.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.657
- Miss Ambrose?
- Yes.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.077
I'm Agent Dana Scully. This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the FBI.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.290
- How can I help you?
- A federal employee has been fatally injured.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.668
There is a case around
the elephant that escaped from your zoo.

07:39.751 --> 07:45.382
I understood that the eyewitnesses said
they didn't know how the man was killed.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.510
What we're trying to determine
is how Ganesha escaped.

07:48.594 --> 07:53.098
- What did Ed tell you?
- He found the cage locked, as he'd left it.

07:53.182 --> 07:57.102
- What more can I say?
- A man was found trampled to death.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.688
An animal from your zoo
was found 43 miles away.

07:59.771 --> 08:05.611
No one's looking to place any blame.
We're just trying to understand the facts.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.072
This is where Ganesha was held
when she wasn't in her habitat.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.701
- Who has keys to this lock?
- Only myself and Mr Meecham.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.746
Otherwise, this is a restricted area.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.541
Elephants aren't good jumpers,
if that's what you're thinking.

08:19.708 --> 08:23.837
No. I was wondering why such
a small pen for such a large animal.

08:23.921 --> 08:28.342
The zoo was built in the 1940s.
The pens and habitats are all too confining.

08:28.425 --> 08:32.929
I was brought on to expand
and create more humane environments.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.390
Unfortunately, these things take time.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.436
- Those, uh... chains on the ground there?
- Those are tie-downs.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.899
They restrict the animal's movement.
I disallowed their use when I came here.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.152
- Disallowed their use by whom?
- It was Ed Meecham's practice.

08:47.236 --> 08:51.114
It reflected an old,
non-progressive zoo policy.

08:51.281 --> 08:56.620
- How's your relationship with Ed Meecham?
- I'm his boss and a woman. Ed doesn't like it.

08:56.787 --> 09:00.249
Would he be vindictive enough
to let Ganesha go as sabotage?

09:00.332 --> 09:05.921
If he did, that would be foolish. The facility is
running at a deficit and may lose its funding.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.715
- Have you discussed the incident with Ed?
- No.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.677
I think Ed's got enough
dealing with the WAO.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.680
- The WAO?
- It's the Wild Again Organisation.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.392
They believe any captive animal
is a crime against nature.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.478
They're gonna have a field day with this one.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.647
Excuse me.

09:24.982 --> 09:30.112
The WAO believes only tragedy results
from keeping animals in captivity.

09:30.195 --> 09:34.324
In the wild, an elephant would roam
an area of 20 square miles minimum.

09:34.408 --> 09:39.872
Ganesha weighed over 5,000 pounds and
she was being held in a 50- by 50-foot cage.

09:39.955 --> 09:44.084
- You consider that inhumane?
- It's like you or I living in a pickle barrel.

09:44.168 --> 09:48.297
FBI files state you've been arrested
over a dozen times for the kidnapping...

09:48.380 --> 09:52.217
...of circus and zoo animals.
- The WAO sees it as liberation.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.886
Hm.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.722
Were you involved
in the "liberation" of Ganesha?

09:56.805 --> 10:00.434
That would make me an accessory
to murder, wouldn't it?

10:00.851 --> 10:04.229
Endangering these animals
is against everything we believe.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.024
These are incredibly spiritual creatures.

10:07.107 --> 10:11.778
Their rituals and behaviour are linked
to a past no man ever witnessed.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.448
Did you know they actually bury their dead?

10:14.531 --> 10:17.534
They can visit
an elephant graveyard centuries old...

10:17.618 --> 10:20.829
...and know instinctively
where their ancestors' bones lie.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.582
What do you think
Ganesha was running from?

10:23.916 --> 10:26.293
You wanna see? I'll show you.

10:26.793 --> 10:30.547
Get up! Halt. I got him.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.675
This is how Ed Meecham
treats these majestic animals.

10:33.759 --> 10:37.304
- This is still going on?
- Meecham's a barbarian.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.974
He's been torturing animals
at the Fairfield Zoo for years.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.895
We figure he's still at it.
Eventually we're gonna get some proof.

10:45.854 --> 10:49.566
We're here to put pressure on the zoo.
We're keeping track of what goes on.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.195
Willa Ambrose claims she's put a stop
to most of his old practices.

10:53.278 --> 10:58.116
Whatever her intentions, she's too
preoccupied to know how Meecham operates.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.327
Preoccupied with what?

11:00.410 --> 11:05.582
A lawsuit she's fighting against the Malawi
government over a gorilla named Sophie.

11:05.666 --> 11:10.796
Willa rescued her from an African customs
house ten years ago. Raised her like a child.

11:10.879 --> 11:15.300
- The Malawi government wants her back.
- Will they win?

11:15.384 --> 11:19.263
This is a perfect example of man's
imperialism over the animal kingdom.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.892
Some craven impulse to turn animals
into objects for our own selfish pleasure.

11:24.017 --> 11:28.522
- I thought you said she rescued this gorilla?
- So she could spend her life behind bars!

11:28.605 --> 11:33.902
Her obligation should have been to return the
gorilla to the wild. Animals should run free.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.115
- Even if it means trampling a man to death?
- Maybe he should have moved.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.994
I'm sure he would have
if he'd seen it coming.

11:42.703 --> 11:46.123
Thanks for your time, sir,
and we'll get back to you soon.

11:58.385 --> 12:02.055
- It's all happening at the zoo, Scully.
- Well, we found our suspects.

12:02.139 --> 12:06.143
- You think they busted out Ganesha?
- You heard him. "Animals should run free."

12:06.226 --> 12:09.813
What about the eyewitness accounts,
the security tapes...

12:09.897 --> 12:14.151
...the fact that no one saw an elephant
until it was miles away from the zoo?

12:14.234 --> 12:18.405
The lights at the construction site
were mercury-vapour, 10,000 candlepower.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.533
They can restrict a man's ability
to adjust to the dark.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.952
And their security cameras are poor quality.

12:24.036 --> 12:27.789
A grey elephant may not have registered
an image on tape in the dim light.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.501
I'm not buying it.
I think these guys are all talk.

12:30.584 --> 12:34.630
These guys are dedicated to exactly
this kind of activity, unabashedly.

12:34.713 --> 12:38.050
- Did you check out the night-vision camera?
- No.

12:38.133 --> 12:41.720
It wouldn't surprise me if they tried
to capitalise on their success.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.057
- By doing what?
- By liberating another animal.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.101
Willa Ambrose said
the zoo was in trouble financially.

12:48.185 --> 12:53.065
The loss of another big exhibit
could shut them down entirely.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.400
All right. You keep an eye on the WAO.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.028
And where are you going?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.197
To talk to the animals.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.368
Beam me up, Scotty!

13:04.451 --> 13:07.204
Did anybody tell you
the camera loves you, Frohike?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.916
Yeah, the arresting officers
at the Free James Brown rally.

13:10.999 --> 13:15.295
- What's this costing the taxpayers, Mulder?
- Uh... about a 150 bucks an hour.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.757
Ouch! Almost as much
as Bill Clinton's haircuts.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.552
- Where's Langly?
- He has a philosophical issue...

13:21.635 --> 13:23.637
...with having his image transmitted.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.474
- What are you doing in Idaho?
- I'm in Fairfield. What do you know about it?

13:27.558 --> 13:32.354
They got a little zoo there. Lots of strange
lore. Animals escaping, disappearing.

13:32.437 --> 13:36.316
- Any idea why?
- You're near the Mountain Home Air Base.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.151
Major UFO hotspot.

13:38.235 --> 13:42.656
Weird fact, Mulder: no animal at Fairfield Zoo
has ever brought a pregnancy to term.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.700
Not a cub or a chick.

13:44.783 --> 13:50.247
The woman in charge has a gorilla that knows
sign language, supposedly a thousand words.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.417
If that's the lovely Agent Scully...

13:53.500 --> 13:56.795
...let her know I've been working out. I'm buff.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.924
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

14:01.008 --> 14:05.095
I was right. I just followed
the kid from the WAO to the zoo.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.098
He's just about to make it over the fence.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.767
All right. I'll be right there, Scully.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.743
What the hell are you doing here?

15:09.826 --> 15:12.955
There's a member of
the WAO on the premises.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.123
Come with me.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.663
What's going on?

16:39.958 --> 16:42.252
OK, Sophie. Calm down.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.477
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.522
You have no idea
what he was doing at the zoo?

17:43.605 --> 17:46.525
If you're asking if I had
any idea of his intentions...

17:46.608 --> 17:49.194
...the answer is simple: not the slightest.

17:49.278 --> 17:52.739
I saw this camera sitting up there
on the shelf yesterday.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.741
Guess I never noticed it before.

17:54.867 --> 17:58.620
A tiger is missing
and a member of your organisation is dead.

17:58.704 --> 18:02.958
For such a principled man,
you show an amazing lack of emotion.

18:03.625 --> 18:07.880
If the tiger killed this person,
then it was a natural act.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.968
If I find evidence that he was releasing
those animals under your orders...

18:13.051 --> 18:15.846
...you'll spend the rest
of your life behind bars.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.599
Scully?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.026
That guy really pisses me off.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.069
- Are you OK, Scully?
- Yeah.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.238
Have you calmed down?

18:34.156 --> 18:37.659
- Have they found the tiger yet?
- No. But I took a look at the cassette.

18:37.743 --> 18:40.245
- He wasn't killed by the tiger.
- What?

18:40.329 --> 18:44.166
Unless it's trick photography,
it was some kind of phantom attacker.

18:44.249 --> 18:48.754
You saw his body! He was mauled to death.
He had claw marks on his chest and back.

18:48.837 --> 18:52.591
I can't explain it, either.
But I know someone who might be able to.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.518
Excuse me? Miss Ambrose?

19:02.601 --> 19:04.895
Can we have a word with you?

19:04.978 --> 19:08.857
I don't know anything more than
I've told the police. I have nothing to say.

19:08.941 --> 19:11.527
Is this where you keep Sophie?

19:12.402 --> 19:16.281
- Sophie is ill.
- Do you think we could meet her?

19:16.657 --> 19:19.618
We're not here
to try to take her away from you.

19:25.541 --> 19:28.919
Six weeks ago I had to take
Sophie out of her public habitat.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.755
She'd become so withdrawn and depressed.

19:31.839 --> 19:35.676
She'd curl into a ball in the corner
of her cage and just shiver.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.720
- Did you ask her why?
- All the time.

19:38.804 --> 19:41.890
- What did she say?
- Light afraid.

19:41.974 --> 19:45.519
- Literally, she's afraid of the light.
- She speaks to you?

19:45.602 --> 19:50.190
Over 600 words using American Sign
Language. She understands over a thousand.

19:50.274 --> 19:53.026
I'll show you her vocabulary list.

19:53.110 --> 19:57.114
- Is this who you wanted to speak to?
- It's basic investigative procedure.

19:57.197 --> 20:02.327
- Interview all the possible witnesses.
- Gorillas are highly sensitive creatures and...

20:02.411 --> 20:05.747
...Sophie's use of language skills
makes her even more so.

20:05.831 --> 20:11.003
- Why would she be afraid of the light?
- You've heard about the Malawi government.

20:11.086 --> 20:15.007
Sophie could be taken away from me
and I think that she knows that.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.176
- Are these Sophie's?
- Yes.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.261
What do you think they mean?

20:19.344 --> 20:22.514
Until recently,
Sophie desperately wanted a baby.

20:22.598 --> 20:27.019
The brown object in the centre
is her expression of that.

20:27.102 --> 20:30.314
- Have you tried to mate her?
- We were looking for a partner...

20:30.397 --> 20:35.444
...but under these stressful conditions,
I didn't wanna put her through it.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.488
- Do you have a veterinary facility here?
- Yeah.

20:38.572 --> 20:42.409
This is a strange request, but it might
help to explain what's been going on.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.704
I'm gonna need your help on this, too, Scully.

20:46.872 --> 20:51.502
- I hope you know what you're getting us into.
- I'm pretty sure of what we're gonna find.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.962
This isn't exactly in my job description.

20:54.046 --> 20:57.758
Next thing you know
they'll be doing it on MTV Sports.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.844
OK, the elephant's cavity is clear.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.013
I'm ready for you.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.939
- The knife's right down there.
- OK.

21:12.022 --> 21:15.984
I was told there's never been a successful
pregnancy at the Fairfield Zoo.

21:16.068 --> 21:19.780
- You've been talking to Kyle Lang.
- Well, is it true?

21:19.863 --> 21:23.909
Yes. But I don't think
for the reasons Kyle claims.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.954
Not because Ed Meecham
has done anything to the animals.

21:27.037 --> 21:29.748
- Why then?
- Bringing a pregnancy to term...

21:29.831 --> 21:34.086
...in captivity is always difficult.
- But a perfect failure rate?

21:34.169 --> 21:38.131
I know. It's one of the things I was
determined to change when I came here.

21:38.215 --> 21:40.509
Was an attempt ever made to mate Ganesha?

21:40.592 --> 21:43.971
No. Mating an elephant
out of the wild is rarely successful.

21:44.054 --> 21:49.977
There have only been six elephants
born in captivity over the last ten years.

21:51.770 --> 21:56.775
Here's the uterine tissue. But I'm still
not clear on what you expect to find.

21:57.109 --> 22:02.739
You're right, Mulder. The signs in
the uterus and the ovaries are unmistakable.

22:02.823 --> 22:05.409
So, what did you find?

22:05.492 --> 22:07.995
This animal had been pregnant.

22:09.121 --> 22:12.082
- What are you talking about?
- There's hypoplasia...

22:12.165 --> 22:14.293
...and the corpus luteum is ruptured.

22:14.376 --> 22:18.463
- That's not possible.
- Neither is an invisible elephant.

22:19.006 --> 22:23.510
- What is going on here?
- Whatever it is, it's been going on a while.

22:23.594 --> 22:27.222
I think you'll find evidence
of the same thing when your tiger returns.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.309
I still can't believe
you bet on the Chargers!

22:32.644 --> 22:35.647
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

22:55.792 --> 22:58.962
- Where's the tiger?
- Inside the site. Two men are trapped.

22:59.046 --> 23:01.131
Put the gun away, Ed!

23:02.257 --> 23:04.635
Do you wanna be responsible
for another death?

23:04.718 --> 23:07.304
We can capture this cat
without harming anyone.

23:07.387 --> 23:11.475
- This is no time for wishful thinking.
- I'm ordering you, Ed.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.479
Yes, ma'am. Lead the way.

23:31.995 --> 23:35.332
How'd the tiger get across town
without being spotted?

23:35.415 --> 23:39.628
I don't know, but we'd better
find her before Meecham does.

24:16.456 --> 24:19.376
Hey! Shh, shh.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.962
It was just here.

24:56.955 --> 24:59.917
It's all right, Willa.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.628
They don't all talk and draw pictures.

25:18.769 --> 25:23.023
This last incident has left the board
with no choice but to withdraw all funding.

25:23.106 --> 25:26.151
If that's your decision,
there's nothing else I can say.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.529
I'm sorry.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.699
It really is a shame. It's too bad.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.297
I'm out of a job.

25:48.799 --> 25:50.759
They've cut off all funding.

25:50.843 --> 25:54.930
The animals are being shipped out
to other zoos, starting Monday.

25:55.013 --> 25:59.017
- I'm sorry.
- It could not have happened at a worse time.

26:00.561 --> 26:02.563
You mean for Sophie?

26:02.646 --> 26:07.693
What I had going for me was
my position here. Having a place for her.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.988
Have the results come in on the tiger?

26:11.071 --> 26:14.157
Agent Scully did the test.
The tiger had been pregnant, too.

26:14.241 --> 26:18.120
It's impossible. There's no chance
those animals could get pregnant.

26:18.203 --> 26:20.622
What if they were artificially inseminated?

26:20.706 --> 26:23.834
That's a very fine and complex process.
I would have known.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.128
Unless it was done somewhere else.

26:26.211 --> 26:29.715
- Where?
- What do you know about alien abduction?

26:32.217 --> 26:34.636
You're... You're kidding me?

26:35.971 --> 26:39.766
You think that these animals
were taken aboard some spaceship?

26:39.850 --> 26:43.395
I don't know, but there's obviously
some problem getting them back.

26:43.478 --> 26:48.317
Due to what may be an astrological variation,
a trouble with the time-space continuum.

26:48.400 --> 26:53.405
These animals taken from cages are returned
two miles west-southwest of this zoo.

26:53.488 --> 26:58.493
- Aliens impregnating zoo animals.
- Yes, and harvesting the embryos.

26:58.577 --> 27:00.871
- Why?
- Maybe their own Noah's Ark?

27:00.954 --> 27:04.082
To preserve the DNA
of these animals that we're depleting.

27:04.166 --> 27:08.504
That's probably why you've never had
a successful birth at this facility.

27:08.587 --> 27:11.048
It's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

27:11.131 --> 27:16.303
I understand that you might think it's
ridiculous. Maybe you should ask Sophie.

27:16.386 --> 27:19.306
You think... this is what she's so afraid of?

27:19.389 --> 27:23.936
I believe she's pregnant.
And she's afraid of them coming for her baby.

27:26.772 --> 27:29.775
Sophie, come here.

27:30.234 --> 27:32.653
I wanna ask you a question.

27:32.736 --> 27:35.197
It's OK, Sophie.

27:36.532 --> 27:39.117
Come here.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.086
- What's she saying?
- She says "man, woman hurt."

27:49.169 --> 27:53.090
She thinks you or your partner
are going to hurt her or me.

27:53.173 --> 27:57.928
Sophie. Man woman are here to help you.

27:58.762 --> 28:02.224
They want to know about Sophie's baby.

28:06.645 --> 28:08.897
- Can I ask her a question?
- Yeah.

28:08.981 --> 28:11.942
Will you ask her if she wants to leave here?

28:12.734 --> 28:14.820
Sophie.

28:14.903 --> 28:17.406
Do you want to leave here?

28:21.451 --> 28:24.079
She says "light afraid".

28:24.162 --> 28:26.665
Sophie, what are you afraid of?

28:27.040 --> 28:29.126
Tell me.

28:30.711 --> 28:35.632
- What did she say?
- She said "Baby go flying light".

28:38.886 --> 28:42.222
I just finished off in the infirmary.

28:42.306 --> 28:45.809
The sheriff's deputy came
looking to serve you papers.

28:45.893 --> 28:48.353
I think it's about Sophie.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.650
- What am I gonna do?
- You can't leave Sophie here...

28:53.734 --> 28:56.945
...if you want to protect her.
- I've nowhere else to take her.

28:57.029 --> 28:59.323
Excuse me.

29:00.574 --> 29:02.868
- Willa Ambrose?
- Yes.

29:02.951 --> 29:08.290
I'm serving you with a court order
to release Sophie into protective custody.

29:40.614 --> 29:45.077
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to ask for your help, Kyle.

29:45.911 --> 29:48.914
- Help with what?
- Sophie.

29:50.582 --> 29:54.962
- They've taken her into protective custody.
- Let her go, Willa.

29:56.046 --> 30:01.885
They're putting her in an iron cage
as we speak, without bars, without windows.

30:01.969 --> 30:03.887
It'll kill her.

30:03.971 --> 30:09.434
Sophie's been behind bars her entire life. Let
her go home, to the freedom she deserves.

30:09.518 --> 30:14.231
Freedom to what? Be killed by poachers
and have her hands cut off as souvenirs?

30:14.314 --> 30:19.820
- They promised she'll be in a preserve.
- She's mine, Kyle. I won't let her go!

30:19.903 --> 30:22.656
Please, come on.
We can find a place for her here.

30:22.739 --> 30:25.200
- A private reserve. You know people.
- No. No.

30:25.284 --> 30:27.786
That's against everything I stand for.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.414
She's pregnant.

30:30.497 --> 30:33.709
- What?
- Sophie's pregnant.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.129
I don't believe you, Willa.

30:38.046 --> 30:40.132
- It's true.
- What if she was?

30:40.215 --> 30:43.218
Is the baby gonna live out
its life behind bars, too?

30:43.302 --> 30:48.098
Look, Willa, she doesn't belong to you.
She's not your child.

30:48.348 --> 30:52.686
She belongs with other gorillas,
not selling tickets for a zoo.

30:53.562 --> 30:56.064
You won't help me?

30:56.148 --> 30:58.025
No.

31:28.722 --> 31:32.809
- Wanna see something interesting?
- Where d'you get this?

31:33.143 --> 31:37.856
I was looking for a pen to finish my report
in Willa's office and that was in her drawer.

31:37.940 --> 31:40.817
It's a small world after all.

31:48.534 --> 31:52.079
It's OK, Sophie. It's OK, honey.

31:52.162 --> 31:55.749
Sophie. Sophie. Sophie, don't worry.

31:56.959 --> 31:58.919
I'm with you.

32:03.924 --> 32:06.009
I love you, too.

32:28.824 --> 32:30.909
Willa?

32:49.845 --> 32:51.972
Willa? Are you here?

33:02.232 --> 33:04.318
Willa, where are you?

33:11.033 --> 33:13.118
Willa?

33:35.432 --> 33:39.436
I told you. It happened exactly
the way it did with the tiger.

33:39.520 --> 33:44.233
I heard the animals going crazy. I got up
to check on Sophie and she was gone.

33:44.316 --> 33:46.944
That's when I found Kyle.

33:47.027 --> 33:50.989
- Any idea what he was doing at the zoo?
- No.

33:51.073 --> 33:55.577
A witness says that you visited
Kyle's office yesterday. Is that true?

33:55.661 --> 33:57.120
Yeah.

33:57.204 --> 34:01.500
- For what purpose?
- Basically, to tell him that he'd won...

34:01.583 --> 34:06.129
...the zoo was being shut down and Sophie
was being taken into protective custody.

34:06.213 --> 34:10.384
Did you ask him to help you take Sophie
to prevent her from being taken from you?

34:10.467 --> 34:14.972
No. That would be against
everything Kyle believed in.

34:15.054 --> 34:18.976
But he helped you to rescue her
originally, isn't that correct?

34:19.059 --> 34:23.105
He had a connection to you and to
this animal that went back several years.

34:23.188 --> 34:27.775
Whatever "connection" he and I had...
was over long ago.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.696
But you asked him anyway... to help you?

34:32.239 --> 34:33.907
No.

34:33.991 --> 34:38.786
Then what was he doing here last night
and why did he give you this note?

34:45.418 --> 34:48.130
I don't know. I told you.

34:49.380 --> 34:53.969
- Did he make a habit of visiting the zoo?
- If he did, it was probably late at night...

34:54.052 --> 34:57.514
...after he'd jumped over the fence
like a good WAO soldier.

34:57.598 --> 35:01.935
Why don't you ask Agent Mulder what he
thinks happened? He has a novel theory.

35:02.186 --> 35:05.105
Maybe it was alien abduction.

35:06.148 --> 35:08.859
Scully, can I talk to you for a second?

35:17.284 --> 35:20.579
- You think she's telling the truth.
- Why do you say that?

35:20.662 --> 35:25.000
Kyle Lang's death and the disappearance
of the animal match the previous incidents.

35:25.083 --> 35:26.335
Yes.

35:26.418 --> 35:29.630
And you've been pushing
this alien abduction angle.

35:29.713 --> 35:34.134
- I still am, but Willa's reactions are wrong.
- To losing Sophie?

35:34.218 --> 35:38.555
I think she knows where Sophie is and Lang
died cos he knows what she's capable of.

35:38.639 --> 35:42.476
- You think she killed him?
- I think she'd do anything to protect Sophie.

35:42.559 --> 35:46.355
Even wait atop a stack of crates
for her former lover to walk underneath?

35:46.563 --> 35:50.609
An examination of the body will give us
a picture of what happened last night.

35:50.692 --> 35:53.570
You do that and I'll check out the warehouse.

37:29.208 --> 37:34.338
- Looks like you're in a hurry.
- Well, there isn't much to hang around for.

37:34.421 --> 37:36.507
I'm afraid there is.

37:37.883 --> 37:41.136
I found evidence
that Kyle died a wrongful death.

37:41.261 --> 37:43.430
He was hit with a cattle prod.

37:43.514 --> 37:48.101
There's gonna be an investigation,
so I have to read you your rights.

37:50.479 --> 37:52.564
It was an accident.

37:53.732 --> 37:55.901
Kyle surprised Ed.

37:56.485 --> 38:00.989
- He wasn't supposed to be there.
- Ed Meecham took Sophie?

38:01.073 --> 38:03.158
Yes.

38:05.244 --> 38:07.454
There was no one else to turn to.

38:08.830 --> 38:10.916
Where is she, Willa?

38:11.792 --> 38:14.211
Ed has her.

38:14.294 --> 38:19.049
She's in some building...
on the road to Boise.

38:28.308 --> 38:32.646
Put it down, Ed. There's been
enough violence, don't you think?

38:33.564 --> 38:37.526
- I didn't kill Kyle Lang.
- Put down the gun and we'll talk about it.

38:37.609 --> 38:40.279
I was only doing what she paid me to do.

38:41.947 --> 38:45.576
- Where's the animal, Ed?
- Down the hall.

38:45.659 --> 38:49.830
You show me where.
We're gonna go there together. Come on.

38:56.670 --> 38:59.965
- What's she doing?
- Throwing herself against the door.

39:00.048 --> 39:02.551
She's gone crazy.

39:15.564 --> 39:19.443
- She's scared.
- Yeah? Well, she's gonna kill herself.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.283
OK, Ed. Well, you're gonna have to save her.

39:26.366 --> 39:29.870
Take your tranquilliser gun.
I'll be right behind you.

39:42.466 --> 39:46.845
I've only got one dart in this thing,
so you gotta get her out in the light.

39:46.929 --> 39:50.933
- Can you see her?
- I think she's over in that corner over there.

39:59.149 --> 40:02.027
Hey, Meecham!

40:05.197 --> 40:07.616
I'm not gonna hurt you.

40:56.373 --> 40:58.458
Mulder!

41:01.211 --> 41:03.297
Mulder!

41:07.634 --> 41:10.512
- Ow!
- Sorry. Lie still.

41:10.596 --> 41:13.599
- Where's Sophie?
- Can we get a paramedic in here?

41:13.682 --> 41:15.684
- Meecham?
- He's been arrested.

41:15.767 --> 41:19.605
We picked him up on the way to Boise.
That's how we found you here.

41:19.688 --> 41:22.065
- They took Sophie.
- Who did?

41:22.149 --> 41:25.986
- Where's Willa?
- She's making a statement about Kyle Lang.

41:26.069 --> 41:28.155
I gotta talk to her.

41:33.702 --> 41:35.537
- Where is she?
- She's gone.

41:35.621 --> 41:39.791
- What did he do to her?
- It wasn't Ed. She tried to tell me something.

41:43.629 --> 41:45.964
- What is that?
- That doesn't make any sense.

41:46.048 --> 41:49.218
- What does it mean?
- Man save man.

41:49.301 --> 41:55.015
We've just received a report
of a large animal spotted on the interstate...

41:55.098 --> 41:58.769
- That's her.
- She's heading back towards the zoo.

42:17.162 --> 42:20.165
- Where is she?
- Over there.

42:20.249 --> 42:22.876
- What happened?
- Animal got hit by a car.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.045
Ran off into the field.

42:36.431 --> 42:41.103
No! No, no, no, no!

42:43.146 --> 42:45.274
Sophie?

42:45.816 --> 42:47.901
Sophie?

42:52.739 --> 42:55.158
No, no.

43:02.457 --> 43:07.754
Ambrose and Meecham have been
charged with manslaughter for Lang's death.

43:07.838 --> 43:11.800
The courts will rule on this matter
and justice will no doubt be served...

43:11.884 --> 43:14.636
...but the pall of a greater tragedy remains.

43:14.720 --> 43:19.558
The motives of the silent visitors who
set these events in motion remain unclear.

43:19.641 --> 43:22.227
Is it a judgment on
a global rate of extinction...

43:22.311 --> 43:26.398
...that has risen to one thousand times
its natural rate in this century?

43:26.481 --> 43:31.862
An act of alien conservation of animals
we are driving hard toward oblivion?

43:31.945 --> 43:35.866
And if so, might it follow
that our own fate and existence...

43:35.949 --> 43:41.413
...could finally be dependent on the
conservatorship of an extraterrestrial race?

43:42.289 --> 43:48.337
Or, in the simple words of a creature whose
own future is uncertain: will man save man?

43:53.276 --> 43:58.694
