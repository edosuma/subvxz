12:01.345 --> 12:05.932
AND HERE IT IS AFTER.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.351
BUT WHAT CAN YOU
DO ABOUT IT?

12:08.519 --> 12:11.271
WELL, YOU COULD RUN AWAY.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.235
HO HO, AS IF THEY'D
COME AND LOOK FOR YOU.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.406
SAY, HERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.782
THINK OF ALL
THE GOOD TIMES

12:22.950 --> 12:25.618
YOU'VE HAD
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

12:27.913 --> 12:32.292
BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALL OVER NOW, HA, HA, HA!

12:41.218 --> 12:45.221
OKAY, HERE WE GO,
SCOTCH ROCKS, SCOTCH ROCKS,

12:45.389 --> 12:49.058
AND A MANGO MARGARITA.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.435
HE WAS IN THE NATIONAL GUARD.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.437
Bull:
AH.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.773
OH, YOU KNOW,
I ALMOST FORGOT,

12:54.940 --> 12:57.358
I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR CAR KEYS.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.861
HOW DRUNK DO YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO GET, HUH?

13:00.029 --> 13:01.613
HOPEFULLY, DRUNK ENOUGH.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.496
MY WIFE'S GOT MY KEYS.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.458
YOU KNOW, BULL,
IF YOU WERE SERIOUS...

13:13.626 --> 13:14.667
I'LL TAKE THAT JOB.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.961
YOU GOT IT. HEY, IT'LL
BE JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.005
I MEAN,
EXCEPT FOR THE KILLIN'.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.594
MIDGE, I NEED MY KEYS.
SHARON, HI.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.679
HONEY,
YOU REMEMBER SHARON.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.098
UH, NO.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.976
SHARON, IS IT?

13:32.144 --> 13:33.394
YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.522
HOW DO YOU KEEP
YOUR HANDS OFF HIM?

13:35.689 --> 13:38.650
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DO.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.904
SO, MY PARENTS ARE, LIKE,
FIGHTING ALL THE TIME,

13:43.072 --> 13:45.323
AND THEY WANT ME
TO CHOOSE SIDES.

13:45.491 --> 13:50.119
BUT I CAN'T,
BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH IDIOTS.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.204
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,
I REALLY THINK

13:51.372 --> 13:55.875
THEY'RE GONNA GET A DIVORCE.

13:56.043 --> 14:00.547
OH MY GOD, DONNA,
I AM SO SORRY.

14:00.714 --> 14:01.381
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.675
THAT VERY THING HAPPENED
TO A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE,

14:03.843 --> 14:07.804
AND NOW SHE HAS
TWICE AS MUCH STUFF,

14:07.972 --> 14:10.431
TWICE AS MUCH CLOTHES,

14:10.599 --> 14:14.018
AND HER PARENTS EVEN FOUGHT
OVER WHO GOT TO BUY HER A CAR.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.273
I MEAN,
YOU'RE RIGHT, JACKIE.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.232
I MEAN,
THIS WHOLE DIVORCE THING

14:19.400 --> 14:20.692
COULD ACTUALLY WORK
TO MY ADVANTAGE.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.694
EXACTLY!

14:22.862 --> 14:24.112
YEAH...

14:24.280 --> 14:25.321
I JUST HAVE TO
MAKE IT VERY CLEAR

14:25.489 --> 14:29.075
THAT MY LOVE IS CONTINGENT
ON HOW MUCH THEY BUY ME.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.286
WHY AM I EVEN
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS?

14:31.453 --> 14:34.330
YOU HAVE
A GREAT HANDLE ON IT.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.461
EXCUSE ME, UM...

14:40.629 --> 14:44.883
JACKIE, WHEN EXACTLY
DID YOU LOSE YOUR SOUL?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.926
UM...

14:47.094 --> 14:48.928
CHEERLEADING CAMP.

14:52.683 --> 14:59.314
YOU ALMOST DONE THERE,
HAZEL?

14:59.481 --> 15:04.068
SEE, THAT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE HAZEL IS A MAID.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.907
OR YOU COULD HAVE
CALLED HIM ALICE, TOO.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.950
SHUT UP, FEZ.

15:11.118 --> 15:15.580
SO, PRETTY TOUGH WITH THAT
SCRUBBER IN YOUR HAND, HUH?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.832
YEAH, I KNOW. HYDE, RED
AND KITTY AREN'T EVEN HERE.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.127
I MEAN, YOU'RE
KISSING PHANTOM BUTT.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.962
YOU KNOW WHAT, FORMAN?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.797
I USED TO THINK RED
WAS A REAL HARD-ASS,

15:24.965 --> 15:28.217
BUT AFTER DOING YOUR CHORES
FOR THE LAST 5 DAYS,

15:28.385 --> 15:29.344
I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION

15:29.511 --> 15:31.679
THAT YOU'RE JUST
A LAZY, SPOILED BRAT.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.890
OOH.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.895
HAZEL NEVER TALKED
LIKE THAT.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.857
HEY...

15:43.025 --> 15:44.275
HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.027
YOU'VE BEEN
DOING THEM FOR 5 DAYS,

15:46.195 --> 15:48.446
TRY 16 YEARS, MAN.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.281
YOU KNOW, I GUESS I'M
JUST GRATEFUL, FORMAN.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.368
WELL, STOP IT!

15:53.535 --> 15:54.702
YOU'RE MAKING ME
LOOK BAD.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.372
PLUS, YOU'VE BECOME, LIKE,
A TOTAL DRAG TO HANG OUT WITH.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.998
HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THE PSYCHOTIC TROUBLEMAKER

15:59.166 --> 16:00.959
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE?

16:01.126 --> 16:02.377
LOOK,
PUT DOWN THE DISHES

16:02.544 --> 16:05.672
AND START DOING SOMETHING
STUPID AND SENSELESS RIGHT NOW.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.257
FORMAN, I'M A GUEST HERE.

16:08.425 --> 16:12.679
WELL... THE-THEN...
FINE.

16:12.846 --> 16:16.349
I GUESS... I WILL HAVE TO
DO SOMETHING STUPID.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.812
HEY, HEY!

16:20.980 --> 16:24.774
I KNOW SOMETHING STUPID
WE CAN DO.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.193
YOU GOT A BOWLING BALL?

16:27.361 --> 16:28.945
WHAT?

16:29.571 --> 16:30.655
AND THEY'RE ARGUING

16:30.823 --> 16:32.824
AND ARGUING
AND ARGUING...

16:32.992 --> 16:34.575
OKAY...

16:34.743 --> 16:36.577
NO OFFENSE, DONNA,

16:36.745 --> 16:40.123
BUT ALL THIS TALK ABOUT
YOUR MOM AND DAD FIGHTING,

16:40.290 --> 16:42.458
WELL, IT'S BORING ME.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.880
REALLY? WELL, TALKING ABOUT
YOUR HAIR WAS FASCINATING.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.594
Fez:
HOLD IT
BY THE THUMBHOLE!

16:58.434 --> 17:01.686
OKAY, WHAT ARE
THOSE IDIOTS DOING?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.313
SOMETHING IDIOTIC.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.232
LET'S GO FIND OUT.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.570
DON'T BE SUCH A BABY.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.905
WE JUST WANT TO SEE
HOW HIGH IT'LL BOUNCE.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.574
NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.118
OKAY, FORMAN, MAN, THINK.

17:17.286 --> 17:21.122
YOU ARE LISTENING TO KELSO.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.040
DON'T DO IT.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.082
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.834
NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO?!

17:25.002 --> 17:27.378
ENOUGH TALK. DO IT.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.175
[CRASH]

17:41.894 --> 17:45.229
SEE, I NEVER EVEN
THOUGHT OF THAT.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.649
LATER.

17:48.817 --> 17:49.484
THANK YOU.

17:49.651 --> 17:50.193
SEE YOU.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.861
BYE.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.866
AH, MAYBE
THEY WON'T NOTICE.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.748
OKAY, KITTY, IT'S YOUR TURN.
PICK A KEY.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.874
[JINGLING]

18:05.042 --> 18:06.918
OH, MY GOSH,
THERE ARE SO MANY,

18:07.086 --> 18:10.797
I CAN'T TELL
WHICH ONES ARE OURS.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.507
KITTY,
YOU DON'T PICK YOUR KEY,

18:12.674 --> 18:14.675
BECAUSE THEN YOU'D GO HOME
WITH YOUR OWN HUSBAND,

18:14.843 --> 18:19.097
AND WHO WANTS THAT?

18:19.264 --> 18:21.516
OH, I, UH...

18:21.683 --> 18:23.726
ME?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.728
BUT THE WHOLE POINT
OF A KEY PARTY

18:25.896 --> 18:29.232
IS TO MEET NEW AND INTERESTING
PEOPLE AND HAVE SEX WITH THEM.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.863
OH, MY GOD...

18:36.031 --> 18:37.782
YOU'RE SWINGERS.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.451
RED, HONEY, IT'S...
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.161
NOW?
I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.871
UM, I LEFT
THE IRON ON...

18:44.039 --> 18:44.747
AND THE STOVE.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.457
I... I... I LEFT THE IRON ON

18:46.625 --> 18:48.584
ON THE STOVE,
WHICH IS ALSO ON,

18:48.752 --> 18:51.337
AND IT CAN'T BE SAFE.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.880
KITTY, WHAT'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

18:53.048 --> 18:55.842
OH, RED, LOOK
WHOSE KEYS I'VE GOT.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.261
OH, DEAR LORD.

18:58.428 --> 19:01.639
YOU LUCKY BASTARD. BITE
HER EARLOBES, SHE LOVES THAT.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.892
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:05.060 --> 19:09.230
RED, YOU DO KNOW THAT THIS IS
A WIFE-SWAPPING PARTY, RIGHT?

19:09.398 --> 19:10.648
WHAT?!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.900
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU WANT
TO SLEEP WITH MY WIFE?!

19:13.068 --> 19:14.443
NO!

19:14.611 --> 19:17.864
I'LL TAKE A RUN
AT ANY ONE OF THESE LADIES.

19:18.031 --> 19:22.076
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH MY WIFE?!

19:22.244 --> 19:23.995
NOTHING, RED,
IT'S JUST DONE RANDOM

19:24.163 --> 19:27.290
SO THAT IT'S FAIR,
THAT'S ALL.

19:27.457 --> 19:30.835
JEEZ, BULL,
I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.171
YOU DO, RED, I'M THE SAME GUY
WHO'S GOT SHRAPNEL...

19:33.338 --> 19:35.089
NO, NO!

19:35.257 --> 19:38.009
GOOD NIGHT.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.845
COME ON, BOB.
THEY'RE SWINGERS.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.972
OH...

20:10.125 --> 20:11.459
WELL, IT...

20:11.627 --> 20:16.839
TOOK A REALLY WEIRD HOP.

20:17.007 --> 20:21.177
WHY WOULD YOU DROP
A BOWLING BALL ON THE COUCH?

20:21.345 --> 20:24.764
WHAT GOOD
COULD COME OF IT?

20:26.475 --> 20:27.934
WELL, OKAY,
HINDSIGHT BEING...

20:28.101 --> 20:32.563
ERIC, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY
MORE OF YOUR DUMB-ASS EXCUSES.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.065
THIS IS THE MOST
IRRESPONSIBLE,

20:34.233 --> 20:38.152
IDIOTIC THING
YOU HAVE EVER DONE!

20:38.320 --> 20:41.155
ACTUALLY, RED,
I DID IT.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.490
YOU?

20:42.658 --> 20:43.324
NO, NO, NO.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.243
DAD, HYDE'S JUST COVERING
FOR ME. I DID IT.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.662
HEY, FORMAN, STOP.
RED, IT WAS ME.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.496
NO, IT WAS ME.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.498
WELL, GUESS WHAT?!

20:50.666 --> 20:52.333
I DON'T CARE!

20:52.501 --> 20:56.087
YOU'RE BOTH IDIOTS!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.256
AND IF YOU HAVE TO GET
A JOB DIGGING DITCHES,

20:58.423 --> 21:01.342
YOU ARE GONNA BUY ME
A NEW TV!

21:01.510 --> 21:02.593
NOW, GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!

21:02.761 --> 21:03.344
YES, SIR.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.179
ALL RIGHT...

21:05.347 --> 21:07.974
SIR.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.395
I COULD HAVE HAD
A CORVETTE!

21:21.196 --> 21:23.114
OH, RED.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.951
NO, KITTY, DAMN IT,
I'M PISSED.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.953
I MEAN, BULL'S
A FREAK-O PERVERT,

21:29.121 --> 21:31.956
AND HE GETS
EVERYTHING HE WANTS.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.500
I WORK HARD,
I RAISE A FAMILY,

21:34.668 --> 21:35.960
AND WHAT DO I GET?

21:36.128 --> 21:42.466
A BOWLING BALL IN MY TV!

21:42.634 --> 21:44.510
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT?

21:47.723 --> 21:51.100
YOUR KEYS.

I WANT A BIG TV.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.280
A BIG ONE.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.197
THIS ONE'S ON SALE.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.908
THAT'S LAST YEAR'S MODEL.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.661
AND MY TV'S GONNA BE NEW.

22:10.829 --> 22:11.412
WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.998
NO REMOTE.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.334
MY TV'S GOT TO HAVE
A REMOTE.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.294
OH, HO HO!
LOOK AT THIS.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.588
26-INCH SCREEN.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.090
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY MADE 'EM THAT BIG.

22:23.258 --> 22:24.759
DAD, YOUR OLD TV
WASN'T THAT BIG.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.928
NO, BUT MY NEW TV'S
GONNA BE THAT BIG.
