00:16.142 --> 00:17.678

00:17.894 --> 00:19.600
[Vic] So, did your girl find
a pack to take her in yet?

00:20.480 --> 00:21.595
[Pyper] Nope. [sighs]

00:21.814 --> 00:24.430
It appears the world still
doesn't know what to do
with an alpha female.

00:25.276 --> 00:26.686
Which is why
us alpha females

00:26.903 --> 00:28.939
need to take matters
into our own hands.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.772
You want to buy
my crappy old motor home?

00:33.576 --> 00:35.316
I do. [laughs]

00:35.536 --> 00:37.527
Yeah.
I mean, um...

00:37.747 --> 00:39.533
Do you have
somewhere else to go?

00:40.333 --> 00:42.699
Well, maybe I could
go live with her.

00:42.919 --> 00:44.750
She could use a roomie.

00:44.921 --> 00:48.664

don't you wish you were me J‘J‘

01:18.079 --> 01:20.536
Ethel's over in Lot 64.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.363
-Ethel?
-Yeah.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.823
Her granddaughter
called you guys

01:24.001 --> 01:25.787
about a stolen
Social Security check?

01:25.962 --> 01:28.328
Oh. Yeah, no,
I'm not here about work.

01:28.548 --> 01:30.664

What are you here for?

01:31.551 --> 01:33.963

for one more caterpillar.

up inside here!

02:50.087 --> 02:51.668
Yeah.

02:51.839 --> 02:55.047
Not exactly like building
the Barbie Dreamhouse, is it?

02:55.259 --> 02:56.715
I had no problem
installing

02:56.886 --> 02:58.501
the water pressure monitor
and the gray water hose,

02:58.679 --> 02:59.885
but for some reason,
the black water hose

03:00.097 --> 03:01.428
doesn't want to connect.

03:01.641 --> 03:03.927
Why don't you let Joe-Mega
slide under there

03:04.143 --> 03:07.385
and apply his magical hands
to your undercarriage?

03:09.065 --> 03:11.397
You need to keep your magic
hands on your own undercarriage.

03:11.609 --> 03:12.815
All right?

03:13.027 --> 03:14.767
I got this. Okay?

03:15.571 --> 03:17.186
Yes, ma'am.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.325
[sighs]

03:23.537 --> 03:24.947
Barbie House is not that easy.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.158

03:27.375 --> 03:29.616
Aah! [whimpers]

03:30.461 --> 03:32.326
What exactly
do you want me to do, Bob?

03:32.963 --> 03:34.954
Billy needs
to get into rehab.

03:35.675 --> 03:38.257
-His drinking's gotten that bad?
-It ain't drinkin'.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.251
It's heroin.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.512
Heroin.

03:43.683 --> 03:44.923
Since when?

03:45.142 --> 03:46.427
I'm not sure.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.103
But it's gotten worse.

03:48.312 --> 03:49.722
Everything has.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.389
I think we did the
wrong thing, Walt.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.734
What do you mean?

03:56.946 --> 03:58.231
Billy's never
forgiven himself

03:58.406 --> 04:00.738
for that drunk driving accident
that just about killed Cady.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.360
I thought I was doing
the right thing

04:02.576 --> 04:04.487
by taking the fall for him.

04:04.704 --> 04:06.535
Turns out it was
the worst parenting mistake

04:06.747 --> 04:09.033
I've ever made,
and that's saying something.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.620
Billy should have
done his time, Walt.

04:15.256 --> 04:18.123
Maybe then he would have stopped
punishing himself.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.768
[man coughs]

05:14.440 --> 05:16.396
[vehicle approaching]

05:24.575 --> 05:26.486
Shit!
Let's get out of here!

05:27.661 --> 05:28.616
[Woman] Come on!

05:49.433 --> 05:50.764
[Walt] Okay, that's enough.

05:53.729 --> 05:54.844
Oh, shit.

05:55.064 --> 05:56.019
Hey.

05:56.857 --> 05:57.846
Hey!

06:01.570 --> 06:03.356
We're here to
help you, Billy.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.734
[Bob] You're sick, son.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.190
You need to get well.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.250
You son of a bitch.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.201
[panting]

06:18.420 --> 06:21.127
You goddamn son of a bitch!

06:25.135 --> 06:26.511
Hey.Hey!

06:26.720 --> 06:28.676
Get off him! [sighs]

06:29.890 --> 06:31.551
-Okay, Bob.
-|t's all right.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.226
It's okay.
It's all right.

06:34.270 --> 06:35.385
I'm good.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.678
What the hell's
wrong with you, boy?!

06:36.897 --> 06:37.977
What are you doing?

06:43.988 --> 06:45.023
[Henry] We have a problem.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.480
Joey Takoda showed up
at the Red Pony.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.281
-Dead.
-Whoever you are,

06:49.493 --> 06:51.654
I hope you know
this call can be traced.

06:51.871 --> 06:53.987
lam on a pay phone.
The call is secure.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.663
What are we going to do
about this dead drug dealer?

06:56.959 --> 06:59.575
Well, that depends.
Did you kill him?

07:04.800 --> 07:05.880
Did I kill him?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.754
Did you kill him,
is the question.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.585
Is this your latest way
of setting me up?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.139
Don't be paranoid,
Standing Bear.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.758
I'm on your side.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.341
Then tell me--
what am I supposed to do?

07:16.687 --> 07:18.427
If you really have nothing
to hide,

07:18.606 --> 07:21.769
then you should do what any
upstanding citizen would do.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.391
Call your local sheriff.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.064
[cellphone beeps]

07:34.288 --> 07:36.904
[Billy] You know,
you can't make me go here.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.198
-You need help.
-Why? Why?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.409
Because I like to party
on my days off?

07:41.629 --> 07:44.086
I got a job.
I pay my bills.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.754
That's more
than you can say.

07:45.925 --> 07:46.835
Damn it.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.541
Look at your arm.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.672
-You're a junkie!
-So what?

07:50.888 --> 07:52.628
I'm an adult.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.555
In fact,
this is kidnapping.

07:55.768 --> 07:56.723
And lam leaving.

07:56.936 --> 07:57.641
Easy.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.102
That's true.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.437
You have every right
to leave this place.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.767
Just as l have every right
to arrest you for possession.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.227
Oh.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.487
Now, you're gonna get clean
either here

08:10.699 --> 08:12.109
or at the Tri-County Jail.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.691
It's your choice.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.196
[sighs]

08:16.538 --> 08:18.199
[sniffs]

08:18.540 --> 08:20.667
[sighs] Fine.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.878
Let's go sign in
or whatever.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.543
Hey,Dad.

08:33.389 --> 08:34.128
Yeah?

08:37.184 --> 08:39.675
You sure you don't want to do
my rehab for me?

08:39.895 --> 08:41.431
Save me the trouble?

08:53.784 --> 08:55.445
You're doing the
right thing, Bob.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.783
[engine shuts off]

09:05.629 --> 09:07.369
[camera shutter clicks]

09:08.090 --> 09:09.455
[Walt] What do we have?

09:09.675 --> 09:11.666
Looks like an OD.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.929
Seems like our friend here
had his own little party.

09:17.975 --> 09:21.684
Found a detergent pod with
what I assume is heroin inside,

09:22.354 --> 09:25.096
a blackened spoon, and a lighter
in a sunglasses case,

09:25.315 --> 09:27.442
and a syringe
on the floorboard.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.982
You find an injection mark?

09:29.194 --> 09:33.187
Uh, yeah. In the
crook of his right arm.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.034
Ferg. Why don't
you give me a hand?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.908
We'll lay him out
on the ground.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.408
Okay, now...

09:59.850 --> 10:01.135
You recognize him?

10:02.728 --> 10:03.763
Maybe.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.639
Not sure from where.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.763
[Vic] His name's Joey Takoda.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.729
Looks like he lives on the Res.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.104
I'll call Mathias.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.780
See if he knows anything.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.364
Hey, Walt.

10:27.086 --> 10:28.622
You're gonna want
to see this.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.667
That's quite the arsenal.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.130
That's interesting.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.758
You want me to find a ball
so we can play catch?

10:44.520 --> 10:46.681
Well, if this
is Joey Takoda's glove...

10:47.356 --> 10:48.971
means he's right-handed.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.978
If you're right-handed, do you
inject your left or right arm?

10:52.444 --> 10:53.684
-Left.
-Left.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.779
So why is he shooting up
into his right arm?

10:58.784 --> 11:00.740
Maybe somebody else
injected him.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.788
What are you two doing?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.036
Looking for more
needle marks.

11:09.253 --> 11:12.290
Sometimes users shoot up
between their toes

11:12.506 --> 11:14.963
to hide
the injection marks.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.504
So far, he's just got
the one injection mark

11:17.719 --> 11:19.380
in his right arm, so...

11:24.977 --> 11:26.513
No marks on this foot.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.389
This one's clean, too.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.819
Which makes me think...

11:35.696 --> 11:37.607
Joey wasn't a user.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.359
Then what was he?

11:40.617 --> 11:41.902
[Malachi] Well, now.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.075
Looky here.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.500
Tickle his toes all you want,
Victoria.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.335
I don't think
he's gonna wake up.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.171
[laughs]

12:04.391 --> 12:06.222
And there he is.

12:06.435 --> 12:09.302
Red Pony's own
cigar store Indian.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.219
[chuckles]

12:13.775 --> 12:16.733
Let's make sure we get plenty
of pictures of everything.

12:17.696 --> 12:21.154
We need to get the victim's car
to the shed for prints.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.073
And let's send that syringe
to the lab in Cheyenne.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.074
Okay.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.451
[trunk lid closes]

12:37.925 --> 12:39.540
[sighs]

12:58.946 --> 13:00.982
[keyboard keys clacking]

13:05.285 --> 13:07.071
So, did you call the sheriff
like I suggested?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.323
Walt is at
the Red Pony now.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.245
Which he has already deduced
to be a murder scene.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.162
So the scumbag
was murdered.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.460
Presumably, that's not a problem
for either of us.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.209
Not until Walt
starts asking questions.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.209
What do I tell him?

13:21.385 --> 13:22.716
How about the truth?

13:22.928 --> 13:24.543
That Joey Takoda
was a drug dealer

13:24.721 --> 13:26.302
who got what
was coming to him.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.131
But I already acted like
I did not know him.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.216
Then don't say anything.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.394
Who cares if Walt figures out
who killed some heroin dealer?

13:41.196 --> 13:42.811
We both should care.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.987
I torched Joey's entire stash,

13:45.200 --> 13:46.906
and when I did,
he was scared for his life.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.075
Clearly, he had
good reason to be.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.492
I think whoever killed him
may be coming after Hector next.

13:52.958 --> 13:53.993
Why?

13:56.086 --> 13:57.747
Days after
I burn Joey's drugs,

13:57.921 --> 13:59.457
he shows up dead
in my parking lot.

13:59.673 --> 14:00.378
Coincidence?

14:00.799 --> 14:02.881
I'm the only one
who knows you're Hector.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.503
And even if someone else
did know,

14:04.720 --> 14:06.335
how would they guess
that Hector was the one

14:06.555 --> 14:07.670
that burned up that heroin?

14:08.849 --> 14:12.341
Maybe because I spray-painted
"Hector Lives" across the house.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.177
Well, that was stupid.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.019
I never intended to be
a criminal mastermind.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.898
And now we have a problem.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.445
I am sure that Walt

14:25.657 --> 14:27.522
will go to Joey Takoda's house
to investigate,

14:27.743 --> 14:29.529
but we might be able
to paint over Hector's name

14:29.745 --> 14:30.825
before he does.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.157
Maybe.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.368
[intercom buzzes]

14:36.585 --> 14:39.748
[Woman] Mathias, Sheriff
Longmire's here to see you.

14:44.009 --> 14:44.873
Or maybe not.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.560
[Vic] Hey. So I got the
coroner's initial results back.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.482
Hey, uh, so,
what did he say?

15:02.694 --> 15:04.559
Joey Takoda died
from respiratory failure

15:04.780 --> 15:07.988
and cardiac arrest
due to a large dose of heroin.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.361
-Was he a user?
-Can't tell yet.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.738
But the coroner couldn't
find any more injection
marks on his body,

15:12.954 --> 15:14.660
so he's gonna do
a more thorough autopsy.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.409
He probably wants
to look at the lungs.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.411
Oxygen deprivation
damages the tissue.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.710
It's a telltale sign
of long-term abuse.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.798
It's so cool
that you know that.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.716
What'd you find out
in your questioning?

15:28.929 --> 15:31.295
Yeah.
Uh, so, um...

15:31.515 --> 15:34.473
there's no evidence of
any bad batches of heroin
making the rounds,

15:34.643 --> 15:36.508
but there has been
a significant uptick

15:36.728 --> 15:38.764
in, uh, heroin overdoses.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.641
Heroin's exploded
over the last couple months.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.939
It's a rare shift
not to have a few heroin cases

15:43.151 --> 15:44.652
coming through the ER.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.273
It's not just here.
It's small towns everywhere.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.113
[chuckles]

15:50.283 --> 15:52.069
Awesome.
Ferg, let's go.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.575
So, I sent the syringe
off to the lab in Cheyenne,

15:57.791 --> 15:59.873
but we're not gonna get
the results back for a while.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.374
Oh, shoot.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.996
I think I left my phone
back there.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.578
I'll be right back.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.332
Excuse me, sir.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.293
Can I ask you a question
you might be able to answer?

16:11.513 --> 16:12.673
I'll try.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.550
What's wrong
with my black water hose?

16:14.724 --> 16:15.850
Black hose.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.474
Ihave
absolutely no idea.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.391
Hey.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.441
Did you forget something?

16:28.738 --> 16:29.898
Idid.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.884
[sighs]

16:58.393 --> 17:01.135
I appreciate you letting me
search the victim's house.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.972
You know anything
about him?

17:06.193 --> 17:07.979
[Mathias]
Well, by the looks of things,

17:08.195 --> 17:10.436
I'm thinking
he didn't have a girlfriend.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.066
Have any enemies?

17:13.241 --> 17:15.027
Yeah. Me.

17:16.244 --> 17:17.620
Why's that?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.865
I arrested this asshole
three separate times

17:20.040 --> 17:21.325
for dealing drugs
on the Res.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.122
But I couldn't hold him.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.621
All l was allowed to do was
charge him with a misdemeanor.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.875
Well, it looks like he died
of a heroin overdose.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.833
-Do you know if he used?
-No idea.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.759
Do you know everyone
who's using hard drugs

17:34.971 --> 17:36.051
in yourjurisdiction?

17:40.101 --> 17:41.557
Well, there's, um...

17:42.687 --> 17:43.722
no needles...

17:44.773 --> 17:47.936
no pipes, no bent spoons
anywhere in this place.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.237
No track marks
on his body.

17:51.446 --> 17:55.359
It's odd for a non-user to die
of an overdose, don't you think?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.361
Honestly, I don't care.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.192
All I know is that
there's one less person

17:59.412 --> 18:01.118
peddling drugs on my land.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.616
But if you're so concerned

18:02.832 --> 18:04.959
about solving the lonesome death
of Joey Takoda,

18:05.168 --> 18:06.624
why don't we head back
to the station

18:06.836 --> 18:08.576
so I can give you my files
on him?

18:11.174 --> 18:13.711
Thanks.
We'll do that.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.582
Looks like
I have a suspect.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.790
Hector doesn't kill.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.829
The real Hector
didn't kill.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.710
I'm not so sure
this new Hector

18:54.884 --> 18:56.749
has the same kind
of self-control.

18:57.554 --> 18:58.714
And as much
as I understand

18:58.930 --> 19:00.511
how the law works
against your people,

19:00.682 --> 19:02.547
ljust can't
look the other way

19:02.726 --> 19:05.138
if Hector killed someone
in my county.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.638
[sighs]

19:06.855 --> 19:08.595
Well, whoever
this Hector is,

19:08.815 --> 19:11.352
I'm not gonna play any part
in helping you arrest him.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.143
You've investigated
the victim's house.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.186
-Favor's finished.
-That's fine.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.192
Now I know
what I'm looking for.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.363
Pain in the butt.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.507
You guys look like
a couple of pros.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.589
If I'm gonna be
in sportsman country,

19:40.764 --> 19:41.719
I'm gonna be a sportsman.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.379
Not a tourist.

19:44.267 --> 19:48.306
I, uh... understand that
you might be a little upset.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.600
So you got my message?

19:50.815 --> 19:52.146
Message?

19:52.359 --> 19:54.975
Oh, the-- the kid
in the parking lot. Joey?

19:56.154 --> 19:59.191
Um, it's a little excessive,
don't you think?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.948
He lost $10,000 worth
of product.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.152
What do you expect?
Time-out chair?

20:05.372 --> 20:08.455
Well, could have been
some kind of mistake.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.033
How does a kid go and lose
that much heroin?

20:11.252 --> 20:12.708
He didn't lose it.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.416
He said some guy named Hector
burned it up.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.256
Well, then,
why didn't you kill Hector?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.671
We couldn't find him.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.670
But we found the kid.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.723
Turns out he couldn't
reimburse our losses,

20:27.560 --> 20:29.175
-so...
-I see.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.302
Well--

20:32.524 --> 20:34.685
Careful now, Wahoo.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.276
Always.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.572
I've got a little over
two grand on me.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.129
[chuckles lightly]

21:07.684 --> 21:10.551
I'll give you two weeks
to come up with the rest,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.476
plus 20% interest.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.772
You do know that I can, uh,
get you something much better.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.187
Like what?

21:20.739 --> 21:22.479
Like the head
of Hector himself.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.567
You mean instead
of the remaining eight grand?

21:26.995 --> 21:27.745
Yes.

21:28.872 --> 21:32.364
Plus, uh... going forward,

21:32.584 --> 21:36.202
I want another 5% on everything
you run through the casino--

21:36.421 --> 21:38.377
that's drugs, whores,
everything.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.673
If this Hector is still, uh,
lurking around,

21:41.843 --> 21:44.755
he'll at least be that much
of a drag on your business.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.337
So, if we, uh,
if we move him out,

21:48.349 --> 21:49.885
everybody wins.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.683
And there won't be anybody here
to match you.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.470
Except maybe you,
old-timer.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.139
I've run into
your kind before.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.896
Yeah? Where?

22:02.113 --> 22:03.569
Belfast.

22:06.618 --> 22:07.983
So, is it a deal?

22:11.122 --> 22:13.113
You're still breathing,
aren't you?

22:15.627 --> 22:16.833
Do you know this man?

22:18.213 --> 22:19.498
Probably not.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.455
His name's Joey Takoda.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.380
Have you heard anything
about him?

22:24.219 --> 22:25.925
Yeah, I heard that
you were looking for him.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.638
[Bob]
Knock it off, Billy.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.678
You owe the sheriff.
Now answer him honestly.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.516
Honestly, the sheriff
can kiss my ass.

22:33.728 --> 22:36.390
Now you can talk to me
like that, but not him.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.813
He deserves your respect.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.729
Now look at this picture
and tell him--

22:41.945 --> 22:44.561
You tell Walt if you've seen
this man before or not.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.523
I know you got some connection
to him.

22:47.742 --> 22:51.530
I found the same heroin pod in
your pocket that I found on him.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.657
All right.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.864
All right.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.499
He's a Res guy.
He's a dealer.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.087
Anything else?

23:00.588 --> 23:02.579
Yeah. If he knew
I was talking about him,

23:02.799 --> 23:03.879
he'd probably show up
at my door

23:04.092 --> 23:05.923
with a baseball bat
and a .30-06.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.716
Joey's dead, Billy.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.883
Did he have trouble
with anyone?

23:11.099 --> 23:14.887
Anybody ever talk about...
sending Hector after him?

23:15.937 --> 23:17.427
Look, I don't know anything
about Hector,

23:17.605 --> 23:19.937
but there was a girl
who tried to get me

23:20.149 --> 23:21.605
to steal a bunch of smack
off of Joey,

23:21.818 --> 23:24.685
which I refused to do
because I'm not an idiot.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.441
You think she may have recruited
somebody else to rip him off?

23:27.657 --> 23:29.067
Yeah, that was her plan.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.654
Is she Cheyenne?
Could she have sent Hector?

23:31.870 --> 23:33.235
No, she's not Native.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.991
But she is persuasive.

23:36.165 --> 23:39.783
-Her name's Jule.
-Ju|e what?

23:39.961 --> 23:42.828
I don't know. It's not like
we spent a lot of time talking.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.332
Is this Jule the same girl

23:44.549 --> 23:45.959
that we found you with
this morning?

23:50.138 --> 23:52.094
I was with somebody
this morning?

23:54.642 --> 23:55.677
[paper rustles]

23:56.769 --> 23:58.851
One last question, Billy.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.680
Have you ever run into anybody
wearing a black hood

24:01.900 --> 24:03.811
and a red sash
around their neck

24:04.027 --> 24:06.814
out at that party site
or on the Res?

24:07.030 --> 24:08.145
No.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.031
I think even I'd remember
seeing something like that.

24:16.414 --> 24:19.247
Walt wants us to go through
mug shots and arrest records.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.744
We're looking for
a woman named Jule

24:20.960 --> 24:22.416
as a possible
murder suspect.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.455
-Jule what?
-Don't know.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.961
Walt says she's a known
heroin user,

24:30.178 --> 24:31.588
probably in her mid-20s.

24:31.763 --> 24:34.049
[sighs] Okay.

24:35.558 --> 24:39.597
"Jule" could be short
for Julia, Juliana...

24:39.812 --> 24:41.803
You know, we should
call the high school

24:42.023 --> 24:44.355
and have them send over
their most recent yearbooks.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.652
The last time heroin swept
through Philly,

24:46.861 --> 24:49.068
it hit the good kids
as hard as it hit the bad.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.522
I saw cheerleading
honor students O.D. at 17.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.528
Since heroin
is new to Durant,

24:54.744 --> 24:56.530
this Jule probably doesn't
have a record yet.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.533
Any hits on Jule?

25:02.168 --> 25:05.001
No, you just called from
the road like a minute ago.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.294
What you looking for?

25:14.514 --> 25:17.096
Well, Ferg and Zach, uh,
put together a list

25:17.308 --> 25:19.139
of possible Hectors
a while back, so...

25:19.352 --> 25:21.343
Yeah.
It's in my desk.

25:21.813 --> 25:24.680
[Ferg] Think there's a Jule
or a Julie on it?

25:25.942 --> 25:28.433
No, but, uh,
it's possible this new Hector

25:28.653 --> 25:30.735
could be another suspect
in this murder.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.278
I found "Hector Lives"

25:32.490 --> 25:33.991
spray-painted
at the victim's house.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.573
Here's the list
with the names on it.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.370
Zach checked into
most of them.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.865
Yeah. Zach.

25:44.836 --> 25:46.076
Do you remember what he said

25:46.295 --> 25:48.001
the last time we were
looking for Hector?

25:48.214 --> 25:50.956
"A badge and a gun
doesn't make you flawless."

25:51.175 --> 25:52.790
-Yeah.
-Well, it wasn't too long ago

25:53.011 --> 25:54.717
that you thought that he was
the one that shot Walt,

25:54.929 --> 25:56.044
so going by that logic...

25:56.264 --> 25:58.300
You think that Zach
is Hector?

25:58.516 --> 26:01.428
Just saying that-- that
the dead guy is a drug dealer.

26:01.602 --> 26:02.887
We can't rule out the idea

26:03.104 --> 26:04.810
that the killer
has a badge and a gun.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.598
Zach doesn't have a badge
anymore.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.183
Does he have a gun?

26:10.778 --> 26:12.894
I-I know
what I said before,

26:13.114 --> 26:16.072
but I really think Zach
just wanted to help people.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.823
Yeah, I'm sure that's what
the new Hector

26:18.036 --> 26:19.651
thinks he's doing, too.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.328
I just feel like
we shouldn't discount people

26:23.541 --> 26:25.873
because we feel like
we know them.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.285
Especially if they're
feeling powerless.

26:31.841 --> 26:32.751
No.

26:33.634 --> 26:34.919
We shouldn't.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.930
[bag crinkles]

26:45.938 --> 26:46.723
Fellas.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.393
I'm guessing
you may have missed out

26:49.609 --> 26:51.816
investing in Apple
and Google stock.

26:52.028 --> 26:57.068
So allow me to introduce
a genuine business opportunity.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.232
What opportunity
is that, boss?

26:59.452 --> 27:02.364
Early retirement
with a big, fat bank account.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.617
And all you have to do is--
is bring Hector to me.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.164
Dead or alive.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.412
Hector's already dead.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.210
Everyone knows that.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.037
He's just
a ghost story now.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.633
No way.
I saw him.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.132
Or I almost did.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.880
Anyway, he's alive
and very real.

27:18.096 --> 27:21.384
As fascinating as this
philosophical debate may be,

27:21.599 --> 27:23.510
somebody's sticking their hand
in our business

27:23.726 --> 27:25.307
and signing it "Hector."

27:25.520 --> 27:27.226
Now, this has got to stop.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.434
Okay. We'll keep
our eyes open.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.481
You'll keep your eyes open?

27:32.693 --> 27:35.400
This isn't a bunch of Indians
sitting around type of deal.

27:35.613 --> 27:38.980
This is "Get off your asses
or else" type of deal.

27:39.492 --> 27:40.732
I can't do it.

27:41.619 --> 27:42.529
What was that?

27:44.038 --> 27:45.369
I'm sorry.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.957
Hector's a spirit,

27:47.125 --> 27:48.786
a descendant
of the Dog Soldiers.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.825
I can't do it.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.085
[sighs]
So you're saying

27:53.297 --> 27:56.664
you're more afraid of Hector
than you are of me.

27:58.302 --> 28:02.011
I'm saying if Hector is really
speaking for our ancestors--

28:02.223 --> 28:03.463
[gunshoﬂ

28:05.977 --> 28:07.467
[gasping]

28:14.652 --> 28:17.485
Well... if Hector
really is a spirit,

28:17.697 --> 28:19.403
you tell him hello for me.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.321
And let him know
that I'm coming for him.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.776
[gasping]

28:24.996 --> 28:27.487
Anyone else have any more issues
they want to settle?

28:28.624 --> 28:29.409
Good.

28:43.514 --> 28:44.219
[Walt] Henry.

28:44.432 --> 28:45.137
Walt.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.727
-Malachi's put fish on the menu?
-No.

28:48.936 --> 28:52.178
A couple of tourists asked me
to cook their fresh catch.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.737
So, uh...

29:00.990 --> 29:04.608
...the man you found today
was actually murdered.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.031
Turns out he was dealing
on the Res.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.871
And "Hector Lives"

29:11.042 --> 29:13.499
was spray-painted
on the side of his house.

29:13.711 --> 29:14.996
Which makes me think
that Hector

29:15.213 --> 29:17.625
may have had something to do
with this murder, so...

29:18.549 --> 29:21.040
I need to ask you something
about this new Hector.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.296
Fire away.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.351
Is Hector...

29:30.561 --> 29:34.429
actually... Mathias?

29:37.944 --> 29:39.525
Mathias.

29:41.364 --> 29:43.855
What makes you think
he has become a vigilante?

29:44.075 --> 29:47.067
Mathias tried to arrest Joey
for dealing,

29:47.286 --> 29:48.742
but he could never
hold him.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.445
So he was frustrated.

29:50.665 --> 29:53.031
Just like he was when he
couldn't arrest Gab's rapist.

29:53.251 --> 29:56.288
Now, becoming Hector
would get him around all that.

29:56.504 --> 29:58.165
Mathias is not the only person
who is frustrated

29:58.381 --> 30:00.121
by the limits
of reservation law.

30:00.341 --> 30:01.421
No.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.670
But Mathias
is the only person

30:03.844 --> 30:06.631
to come to me with notes taken
from Hector's jar.

30:07.348 --> 30:11.682
Now, one of those notes called
for the death of Gab's rapist.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.389
Mathias claimed that he
intercepted those notes,

30:14.563 --> 30:18.602
but if he did, how would Hector
know to show up at the bonfire

30:18.818 --> 30:22.356
unless Hector is Mathias?

30:23.990 --> 30:25.275
[sighs]

30:28.160 --> 30:30.071
You said you found
"Hector Lives" graffiti

30:30.288 --> 30:31.824
-at the victim's house?
-I did.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.155
And Mathias tried to keep me
from finding it.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.661
But the body was found here
in the parking lot.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.702
If it was Hector
that killed him,

30:39.880 --> 30:41.211
why not write "Hector Lives"
on the car

30:41.424 --> 30:42.789
or on the side
of the Red Pony?

30:43.009 --> 30:44.545
Why do it all the way back
at the victim's house?

30:44.760 --> 30:45.875
I don't know.

30:46.095 --> 30:48.928
Is it possible that this murder
is unrelated to Hector?

30:50.016 --> 30:53.725
Either way, this new Hector
needs to be stopped.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.603
Okay.

30:58.983 --> 31:03.147
But given
all the... attention

31:03.321 --> 31:06.028
focused on you
with your civil suit,

31:06.240 --> 31:08.572
you should probably rule out
all other suspects

31:08.784 --> 31:11.070
before you make an accusation
that serious.

31:13.873 --> 31:15.738
[fish sizzling]

31:20.254 --> 31:23.872
So, what abuse of authority
is on the menu today?

31:24.091 --> 31:25.752
Harassment?
Entrapment?

31:25.968 --> 31:27.754
I'm actually investigating
a murder,

31:27.970 --> 31:29.301
so if you'll excuse me.

31:29.513 --> 31:30.889
My son is not a murderer.

31:31.098 --> 31:33.510
-Where are you going?!
-To talk to your son.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.300
[Vic] Hey, Travis!
Are you up yet?

31:37.229 --> 31:39.436
| Vic?
s that you?!

31:39.648 --> 31:41.354
Uh,yeah.
Of course I'm up.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.390
Um... what are you doing here?

31:44.111 --> 31:45.226
Ineed
to ask you something.

31:45.446 --> 31:46.777
Uh, yeah, sure.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.525
The-- The door's unlocked.

31:48.741 --> 31:51.528
Nope.
Not this time, missy.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.401
Um...

31:53.621 --> 31:55.577
your mommy
won't let me in.

31:55.790 --> 31:57.121
Mom!

31:57.917 --> 32:00.784
Answer the question
through the door, Travis.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.872
[sighs]

32:03.089 --> 32:04.249
Um...

32:07.343 --> 32:09.174
Do you recognize
that guy?

32:12.014 --> 32:13.879
I don't think so.
Who is he?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.715
His name's Joey Takoda.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.642
He's a drug dealer that was
found murdered at the Red Pony.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.721
I was thinking maybe you'd seen
him there, at the casino?

32:21.941 --> 32:23.351
I don't recognize him.

32:23.567 --> 32:24.943
What about
a girl named Jule?

32:25.152 --> 32:27.564
-You ever run into her?
-The singer?

32:27.780 --> 32:30.271
Oh, I wish he would meet someone
like that instead of--

32:30.491 --> 32:32.106
Mom. Damn it!

32:32.952 --> 32:34.158
I think I can handle this.

32:34.370 --> 32:35.860
Of course
you think you can.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.320
But I'll be watching.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.122
I see everything.

32:44.213 --> 32:45.999
I'm sorry. Um...

32:47.591 --> 32:50.424
I don't think
I know any Jule.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.002
I'm sorry. I-I wish--
I wish I could help you.

32:53.222 --> 32:56.510
Um... you might
still be able to.

32:56.684 --> 32:57.799
Yeah?

32:58.018 --> 33:00.395
You used to have
a trailer home, right?

33:00.563 --> 33:01.643
Yeah. Yeah.

33:02.231 --> 33:04.347
What the hell is wrong
with my black water hose?

33:08.446 --> 33:10.311
[knock on door]

33:10.531 --> 33:11.611
Come in!

33:18.789 --> 33:21.656
I got your message.
What did Walt say?

33:23.127 --> 33:25.789
Walt thinks Hector murdered
the heroin dealer.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.248
Well, we knew
that would happen.

33:27.465 --> 33:29.922
And he thinks
Hector is you.

33:30.426 --> 33:31.962
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:32.595 --> 33:33.835
Me?

33:37.057 --> 33:38.638
Shit.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.011
Well put.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.594
So, what's Walt
gonna do now?

33:44.440 --> 33:45.850
[Henry]
I imagine he will keep digging

33:46.066 --> 33:47.681
until he proves his theory.

33:48.694 --> 33:49.774
But...

33:54.109 --> 33:54.283
If we can not Walt off the Idea
that Hector Is a klllor.

33:54.283 --> 33:55.272
he might stop.

33:55.493 --> 33:57.734
He'll still
be suspicious of me.

33:57.953 --> 33:58.988
And that'll put him
awfully close

33:59.163 --> 34:00.744
to discovering the truth
about you.

34:03.876 --> 34:06.834
Well, then maybe we should start
with the truth about me.

34:07.004 --> 34:09.290
Walt needs to realize
that all that Hector did

34:09.507 --> 34:11.293
is burn
Joey Takoda's drugs.

34:11.509 --> 34:13.170
Well, how are you
gonna manage that?

34:15.596 --> 34:17.257
Very carefully.

34:17.765 --> 34:20.222
And with your help.
[grunts]

34:25.439 --> 34:26.975
How are you
feeling, Billy?

34:28.651 --> 34:30.858
Like warmed-over shit.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.565
My deputies have, uh,
put together some pictures.

34:38.661 --> 34:40.492
Are any of these women
the Jule

34:40.704 --> 34:43.116
that wanted your help
ripping off Joey Takoda?

34:46.710 --> 34:47.699
[sniffs]

34:50.130 --> 34:51.586
Man, I don't know.

34:52.216 --> 34:54.172
I just see her at parties.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.921
She'd show up
whenever I scored dope.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.839
Uh...

35:04.186 --> 35:05.517
I think that's her.

35:08.232 --> 35:09.312
There.

35:11.318 --> 35:12.819
Well, she's changed,

35:13.028 --> 35:15.565
but I think that's who
you were with yesterday.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.147
Is that--
Is that a yearbook photo?

35:18.325 --> 35:21.067
It is. Junior year.

35:21.245 --> 35:22.735
How many years ago?

35:23.205 --> 35:24.706
Last year.

35:24.915 --> 35:26.951
So Jule would be 18,
at most.

35:28.961 --> 35:30.326
18.

35:40.931 --> 35:42.091
Shit.

35:43.684 --> 35:45.140
[exhales sharply]

35:47.438 --> 35:49.554
[Vic] All right, ma'am.
I understand.

35:51.108 --> 35:53.190
Can you at least tell me
where to find Jule?

35:53.360 --> 35:56.602
[keyboard keys clacking]

35:56.822 --> 35:59.188
And do she and her grannie
share the same last name?

36:00.701 --> 36:01.565
Hello?

36:02.578 --> 36:03.283
Hello?

36:03.495 --> 36:06.532
[thudding]

36:06.749 --> 36:07.989
[sighs]

36:12.755 --> 36:13.995
Any progress?

36:14.214 --> 36:16.421
Oh, I don't know.

36:16.634 --> 36:19.501
Does completely solving
your entire damn problem

36:19.720 --> 36:20.800
count as progress?

36:21.305 --> 36:22.761
Are you serious?

36:22.973 --> 36:24.929
You fixed it?
How?

36:25.684 --> 36:29.268
Good ol' American
stick-to-it-iveness
and ingenuity.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.811
Also, uh...

36:32.107 --> 36:33.847
I went up
to the hardware store.

36:34.068 --> 36:37.811
Your-- Your adapter--
well, it was all busted.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.146
It turns out the, uh, male end
and the female end

36:40.324 --> 36:43.441
weren't exactly,
uh, simpatico.

36:43.661 --> 36:46.528
I guess I have intuition when
it comes to stuff like that.

36:48.749 --> 36:51.456
So, um, you're welcome.

36:51.669 --> 36:53.125
How about you?

36:53.337 --> 36:55.328
Any luck on your--
your Jule search?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.754
Uh, all Jule's mom
would tell me

36:57.925 --> 36:59.711
was that after she kicked
her daughter out of the house,

36:59.885 --> 37:01.421
Jule moved in with
her Grannie Ethel.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.302
[tool thuds]

37:08.519 --> 37:09.679
What is it?

37:09.895 --> 37:11.601
Um...

37:12.439 --> 37:14.725
Lot 64.

37:14.942 --> 37:20.403
Yesterday, I heard about...
an Ethel and her granddaughter,

37:20.614 --> 37:23.447
and they live on Lot 64.

37:30.749 --> 37:31.909
Oh, Walter.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.073
There you are.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.835
Bob Barnes just called,

37:37.047 --> 37:40.665
and they're kicking Billy
out of the rehab facility.

37:41.468 --> 37:44.585
Kicking him out?
What for?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.175
Well, Bob can't afford it.

37:47.391 --> 37:49.427
I've been calling around
to see if the state facilities

37:49.601 --> 37:52.058
can take him,
but they've all got wait lists.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.096
I remember
what a sweet little boy he was.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.235
Do you know anybody
with some pull

38:02.906 --> 38:07.070
that could maybe help him
get moved up the list?

38:08.537 --> 38:10.277
Actually, I do.

38:12.166 --> 38:13.497
[clears throat]

38:21.800 --> 38:23.586
[Ethel]
Can I help you, hon?

38:23.761 --> 38:26.594
Yeah, I-I'm Deputy Moretti
from the sheriff's department.

38:26.764 --> 38:30.507
Oh, did you find
my Social Security check?

38:30.684 --> 38:33.517
Well, my granddaughter called
you about it last week.

38:33.729 --> 38:35.139
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.936
-We haven't found it yet.
-Oh.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.310
But I am looking
for your granddaughter.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.897
-Ju|e, is it?
-Ju|iette.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.274
Well, I think
she's in the bathroom.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.276
I hear the water running.

38:46.492 --> 38:48.733
She'll just be a minute.
Come on in!

38:50.496 --> 38:51.235
Thank you.

38:55.959 --> 38:56.823
Come on in.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.414
I'll just check and see
if she's out of the shower.

38:59.630 --> 39:00.540
Okay.

39:01.215 --> 39:04.457
Juliette,
someone is here to see you.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.300
[knock on door]

39:22.402 --> 39:24.063
I'm sure
she'll be right out.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.860
Can I get you
a ginger ale?

39:26.073 --> 39:27.734
-Uh, yes, please.
-Okay.

39:27.950 --> 39:28.860
Have a seat.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.286
[Travis] Hey.

39:39.419 --> 39:40.374
Jule!

39:41.296 --> 39:42.581
Can we-- Can we talk?

39:43.674 --> 39:44.629
No.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.165
-Hey!
-No!

39:46.385 --> 39:47.670
Hey! Come back!
Stop!

39:47.886 --> 39:49.842
-No!
-Citizen's arrest!

39:50.722 --> 39:52.633
So does your granddaughter
live here with you?

39:52.850 --> 39:55.887
Yes. Uh-huh.
But I barely see her anymore.

39:56.103 --> 39:58.469
She's a very busy
young woman.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.890
Halt in the name of the Absaroka
County Sheriff's Department!

40:06.113 --> 40:08.399
[Ethel]
With her job and her friends,

40:08.615 --> 40:11.197
we always called her
our overachiever.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.241
[chuckles]

40:13.453 --> 40:15.614
Get away from me!
[grunts]

40:15.831 --> 40:18.789
Get away! Agh!
Get away from me!

40:19.001 --> 40:20.582
-Calm down.
-[screams]

40:20.794 --> 40:21.749
You know,
she's been in there a while.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.501
Do you mind
if I go check on her?

40:24.172 --> 40:26.424
Well, I-- I suppose
that's fine.

40:27.634 --> 40:29.010
Okay. Thank you.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.141
[knock on door]

40:38.896 --> 40:40.978
[Jule screams]
Let me go, you asshole!

40:41.189 --> 40:43.896
I really hope this is the girl
you're looking for.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.646
-Let me go!
-Just chill out!

40:46.862 --> 40:47.772
[Jule groans]

40:49.823 --> 40:50.858
[Walt sighs]

40:54.244 --> 40:55.359
Do you know this man?

40:56.580 --> 40:57.490
Nope.

40:57.915 --> 40:59.155
[Walt] Really?

40:59.750 --> 41:02.116
I heard that he was
your heroin dealer.

41:02.336 --> 41:04.122
And you were planning
on robbing him.

41:04.338 --> 41:08.172
[chuckles]
Sounds like junkie talk to me.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.044
Drop the attitude, Jule.
We know Joey's dead.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.216
We're investigating
his murder, okay?

41:12.429 --> 41:15.045
And the junkie talk
that we're hearing

41:15.265 --> 41:17.927
is more than enough to make you
our primary suspect.

41:19.102 --> 41:20.603
Well, I didn't kill him,

41:20.812 --> 41:23.269
and I wasn't planning
on robbing him, either.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.522
l was just planning
on getting what was mine.

41:25.734 --> 41:26.940
He owed me.

41:27.152 --> 41:28.232
What'd he owe you?

41:29.613 --> 41:30.523
Money?

41:31.782 --> 41:36.367
Let's say, hypothetically,
a girl needed medicine.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.990
But that girl
has no money.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.655
So, hypothetically,

41:43.085 --> 41:44.621
this girl becomes
really friendly

41:44.836 --> 41:47.794
with the guy with [chuckling]
a lot of medicine

41:48.006 --> 41:49.792
so she could get more.

41:50.550 --> 41:52.586
You slept with a drug dealer
for heroin?

41:53.637 --> 41:54.968
Yeah. It's not
actually something

41:55.180 --> 41:58.468
you would put
in your annual Christmas letter.

41:58.642 --> 42:00.223
But, yeah, I did.

42:00.435 --> 42:03.051
[Walt]
You said that Joey owed you.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.978
Did something go wrong
with your arrangement?

42:06.942 --> 42:08.148
You could say that.

42:12.322 --> 42:13.903
[sighs]

42:14.116 --> 42:18.359
We were at Joey's,
the usual arrangement.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.957
After we'd spend some time
together,

42:23.125 --> 42:24.990
he was gonna hook me up.

42:29.089 --> 42:30.169
By who?

42:30.382 --> 42:31.292
I don't know.

42:31.508 --> 42:34.420
This... redheaded dude.

42:34.636 --> 42:35.796
I didn't get a name,

42:36.013 --> 42:38.595
but [chuckles]
Joey was scared of him.

42:38.807 --> 42:41.514
Anyway, this redhead
told Joey

42:41.685 --> 42:43.971
that he was short 100 bucks
this week

42:44.187 --> 42:48.351
and that if it happened again,
he'd get "emotional."

42:50.694 --> 42:54.357
After that, Joey refused to
give me any more from his stash

42:54.573 --> 42:59.283
after I'd completely satisfied
my end of the deal.

43:02.414 --> 43:04.996
So, did you get someone
to help you rob Joey?

43:05.208 --> 43:07.199
I didn't rob Joey.

43:07.419 --> 43:08.829
I didn't need to.

43:09.629 --> 43:11.790
I found another way
to score.

43:11.965 --> 43:13.330
You find someone else
to sleep with?

43:17.512 --> 43:20.629
Grannie Ethel always said
I was a very clever girl.

43:58.595 --> 43:59.835
Hello!

44:00.055 --> 44:02.888
Got a Meat Lovers,
half-order of garlic knots!

44:21.159 --> 44:22.444
[sighs]

44:27.290 --> 44:28.325
[engine starts]

44:29.042 --> 44:30.498
[screaming]

44:34.756 --> 44:37.919
Brought over those files
on Joey Takoda I mentioned.

44:38.135 --> 44:40.171
Thanks.
[clears throat]

44:41.054 --> 44:42.089
Take a seat.

44:46.184 --> 44:48.220
In your many run-ins
with Joey,

44:48.436 --> 44:50.518
did you ever encounter
a redheaded man?

44:51.439 --> 44:53.020
No. Why?

44:53.233 --> 44:54.689
Because a redheaded man

44:54.901 --> 44:57.734
seems to have been
Joey's heroin supplier.

44:58.822 --> 45:01.939
He also threatened his life
when he was short on a payment.

45:03.243 --> 45:05.325
Does that mean you're off
your Hector theory?

45:09.124 --> 45:10.910
Is that why
you're really here?

45:11.084 --> 45:13.325
To see if I'm off
my Hector theory?

45:15.630 --> 45:16.836
[knock on door, door opens]

45:17.048 --> 45:18.584
Walter, excuse me.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.337
Jamie DeBell
is on line one.

45:21.553 --> 45:24.010
-What does he want?
-I couldn't tell.

45:24.222 --> 45:25.598
He was hyperventilating.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.470
[panting]

45:30.645 --> 45:32.806
He s-- He said his name
was Hector.

45:33.023 --> 45:35.810
He held me up
and then took my car.

45:36.026 --> 45:38.483
-Who would want to steal my car?
-Nobody.

45:40.447 --> 45:42.153
Found it down the road.

45:46.786 --> 45:47.821
[groans]

45:50.040 --> 45:51.280
So, what'd this Hector
look like?

45:51.499 --> 45:52.659
I don't know.

45:52.876 --> 45:55.538
He had a black hood
covering his face

45:55.754 --> 45:57.619
and a red string
around his neck.

45:57.839 --> 46:00.706
Which honestly seemed like
kind of a safety hazard.

46:02.594 --> 46:03.925
How tail was Hector?

46:04.137 --> 46:06.469
He was tall.
About as tall as you.

46:07.432 --> 46:10.174
-Hector again?
-Sounds like it.

46:11.228 --> 46:13.310
-Did he say anything to you?
-Yeah.

46:13.480 --> 46:16.517
Said I was spreading poison
on the reservation.

46:16.733 --> 46:19.770
Then he took my merchandise
and burned it.

46:22.739 --> 46:25.822
-What kind of merchandise?
-Tell him.

46:26.826 --> 46:30.159
I'm a...
cannabis enthusiast.

46:30.372 --> 46:32.237
So Hector
burned your pot?

46:33.250 --> 46:35.787
He said, "You stay on your land,
I'll stay on mine."

46:35.961 --> 46:37.701
I told him,
"You got a deal."

46:38.713 --> 46:40.920
If Hector's going around
destroying drugs,

46:41.132 --> 46:43.839
maybe he just burned
Joey Takoda's stash.

46:44.386 --> 46:46.593
Well, like I said,
Hector doesn't kill.

46:48.056 --> 46:51.048
I noticed a burn barrel
in Joey's backyard.

46:51.268 --> 46:53.634
You should go back and check
for heroin residue.

46:56.815 --> 46:59.602
You ever run
into a redheaded heroin dealer?

47:00.277 --> 47:02.734
Yeah, actually.
H-How did you know?

47:02.946 --> 47:05.779
He offered me a job
dealing heroin.

47:05.991 --> 47:08.607
I turned him down 'cause
I-I don't do the hard stuff.

47:08.827 --> 47:10.067
Too much stress
makes me nauseous.

47:10.287 --> 47:11.777
You get his name
or anything?

47:11.997 --> 47:13.453
I got a business card.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.827
There's no name,
but a number.

47:19.963 --> 47:21.294
So you've kept it?

47:22.424 --> 47:24.130
I didn't want to litter.

47:28.471 --> 47:29.756
I need you
to call him back.

47:29.973 --> 47:30.928
Tell him you've changed
your mind.

47:31.141 --> 47:32.472
You want to meet.

47:32.642 --> 47:35.509
I assume that's preferable
to a drug dealing arrest.

47:37.939 --> 47:40.897
I thought you and I had...
an arrangement.

47:41.109 --> 47:42.565
[Mathias]
But you and I don't,

47:42.777 --> 47:44.563
and this is my jurisdiction.

48:00.128 --> 48:01.584
Your grandmother
thought I was visiting her

48:01.796 --> 48:04.082
about a lost
Social Security check.

48:04.883 --> 48:06.794
She said that you'd
reported it missing.

48:08.094 --> 48:09.595
But I checked.

48:11.056 --> 48:12.637
You didn't report it.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.475
Because you're the one
that stole it, aren't you?

48:19.564 --> 48:20.679
Yeah.

48:22.484 --> 48:24.975
I stole my own grandmother's
Social Security check

48:25.195 --> 48:27.607
so I could go and get high.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.401
And I've always been
her favorite one.

48:34.329 --> 48:35.694
Have you stolen any more
from her?

48:36.206 --> 48:38.663
No. No.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.834
I found that having sex
with a drug dealer

48:44.005 --> 48:46.587
was easier to live with
than stealing from her.

48:54.599 --> 48:55.759
[clears throat]

48:56.726 --> 48:57.590
Come on.

48:58.978 --> 49:00.263
I'll walk you in.

49:08.822 --> 49:11.404
Juliette.
You okay?

49:14.661 --> 49:16.322
You know,
she's actually, uh--

49:17.747 --> 49:19.032
She's more than okay.

49:19.249 --> 49:21.706
She just helped us
with an important investigation.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.963
And that actually
entitles her...

49:27.298 --> 49:28.333
to a reward.

49:28.550 --> 49:30.256
[clears throat]

49:30.468 --> 49:32.004
But your granddaughter here--

49:34.180 --> 49:37.047
she wanted me to make
the reward check out to you

49:38.268 --> 49:41.635
because she thought
that that might help you

49:41.855 --> 49:44.892
with the loss of your
Social Security check.

49:54.033 --> 49:55.239
Thank you.

49:58.037 --> 50:00.995
And thank you,
my precious Juliette.

50:12.260 --> 50:13.921
W-Why wouldn't he meet
at the location we suggested?

50:14.137 --> 50:15.752
Why's he got to meet out here?
What's it mean?

50:15.972 --> 50:18.088
Jamie. Jamie.
You need to relax.

50:18.308 --> 50:22.017
All you got to do is get
the heroin and leave.

50:22.228 --> 50:24.765
-We'll take care of
the rest, okay?
-Okay.

50:24.981 --> 50:28.394
Um, I'm guessing you want me
to record the conversation?

50:28.610 --> 50:29.645
That would help.

50:29.861 --> 50:32.273
Okay. Here.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.613
You-- You need
me wired up, right?

50:37.452 --> 50:40.194
Uh, just hit record...

50:40.413 --> 50:41.949
and you're wired.

50:44.167 --> 50:46.408
And while you're at it, see if
he'll give you any syringes.

50:47.212 --> 50:49.248
The victim had a large
yellow syringe on him.

50:49.464 --> 50:50.795
I was just at the hospital
with Travis,

50:51.007 --> 50:52.543
and they use
different syringes.

50:52.759 --> 50:54.295
So if this redhead
has a yellow one,

50:54.511 --> 50:56.172
that could connect him
to the murder.

50:57.138 --> 50:59.424
Murder? You-- You didn't
say anything about a murder.

50:59.641 --> 51:01.177
Is that who I'm gonna meet?
A killer?

51:01.392 --> 51:02.893
Jamie. Jamie.
Come here. Come here.

51:03.102 --> 51:06.936
Now, you were very good to
my wife during a difficult time.

51:07.148 --> 51:08.809
I don't forget that.

51:09.984 --> 51:13.442
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, okay?

51:14.906 --> 51:17.522
Okay. Okay.

51:17.742 --> 51:21.360
Okay. Okay. [sighs]

51:29.921 --> 51:31.786
[engine starts]

51:32.006 --> 51:33.086
You sure we have
enough evidence

51:33.299 --> 51:35.585
to convict this guy
of the murder?

51:37.220 --> 51:40.587
If we don't, at least we can
get him for selling heroin.

51:44.894 --> 51:46.134
So, are we in the clear?

51:46.354 --> 51:48.640
[Mathias]
You are a criminal mastermind.

51:48.856 --> 51:51.689
Walt seems to be off Hector
as a murder suspect.

51:51.901 --> 51:53.482
And off me as Hector.

51:53.695 --> 51:54.525
Good.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.352
Now we just have to keep him
off of me.

51:56.573 --> 51:57.528
[cellphone beeps]

52:10.545 --> 52:11.785
Looking for something?

52:12.463 --> 52:14.294
Yeah. Hector.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.507
[bottles clink]

52:18.720 --> 52:20.426
He does not seem
to be here.

52:21.264 --> 52:23.380
Yeah, I know.
But he's been here.

52:24.767 --> 52:27.554
I've seen "Hector Lives"
graffiti in here before.

52:29.522 --> 52:32.935
If you hear any Hector rumors,
let me know and I'll cut you in.

52:33.818 --> 52:35.103
On what?

52:35.320 --> 52:37.060
The bounty
on Hector's head.

53:00.428 --> 53:01.793
Remember me?
We just talked.

53:02.013 --> 53:03.674
I'm here for my supply.

53:08.478 --> 53:10.639
I-I'm, uh, pretty excited
about--

53:11.898 --> 53:14.480
I mean, it's a real
gr-growth opportunity for me.

53:15.526 --> 53:17.687
It may take me a while
to-- to move the heroin, though.

53:17.904 --> 53:19.860
A lot of my regulars don't--
don't use it.

53:28.831 --> 53:30.207
Just don't come up short.

53:32.377 --> 53:35.164
First time you're short,
you get a warning.

53:35.963 --> 53:40.377
The second time...
I get emotional.

53:50.436 --> 53:51.425
It's in there.

53:56.901 --> 53:57.936
Oh.

54:08.204 --> 54:09.569
Okay I take
some of these?

54:09.789 --> 54:10.778
Knock yourself out.

54:24.554 --> 54:25.293
[Ferg] Hands up!

54:29.058 --> 54:30.559
Down on the ground.

54:31.561 --> 54:32.596
On the ground.

54:32.812 --> 54:35.269
Kiss my ass,
you filthy pig!

54:36.149 --> 54:38.686
[grunting]

54:38.901 --> 54:40.311
[Ferg] You're under arrest...

54:41.904 --> 54:43.769
for possession
and intent to distribute!

54:43.990 --> 54:45.070
Get away from the water!

54:45.241 --> 54:46.526
Easy!

54:46.743 --> 54:48.074
Easy, Sheriff.

54:48.244 --> 54:49.359
You got nothing
on me, pig!

54:49.579 --> 54:50.819
Easy there, Pacino.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.289
Don't oversell it.

54:52.498 --> 54:53.658
Is there some kind
of problem here?

54:53.875 --> 54:55.331
Not if you come over here
right now.

54:55.543 --> 54:57.374
All right. Yeah.
I got it.

55:02.884 --> 55:03.964
On your knees.

55:11.768 --> 55:15.260
Whoa, now.
That hurts.

55:15.480 --> 55:18.392
Yeah.
That's the idea.

55:19.484 --> 55:20.189
Come on.

55:31.829 --> 55:35.162
My dad loved his Westerns.

55:36.918 --> 55:39.830
"Ride The High Country,"
"Pale Rider,"

55:40.004 --> 55:41.414
"Fistful of Dollars."

55:41.631 --> 55:43.747
He loved all that redneck shit.

55:45.092 --> 55:47.128
So, that deer up there.

55:47.762 --> 55:49.093
Did you kill that thing
yourself?

55:51.808 --> 55:53.218
What about you, Eddie?

55:56.062 --> 55:57.427
Did you kill this man?

55:58.773 --> 56:00.729
|-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

56:02.068 --> 56:05.902
So, there's what,
just you and that deputy here?

56:06.113 --> 56:08.399
[imitates gun firing]

56:08.616 --> 56:10.527
[chuckles]

56:10.743 --> 56:14.031
Or are there others out there
wrangling up steers somewhere?

56:14.205 --> 56:18.039
Mr. Harp, I don't think you're
understanding the situation.

56:19.752 --> 56:23.165
This man was drugged and killed
with a heroin overdose

56:23.381 --> 56:25.042
from a large
yellow syringe,

56:25.258 --> 56:27.920
which matches the drugs
and syringe

56:28.135 --> 56:29.671
that we just found on you.

56:29.846 --> 56:31.757
Nah,nah.

56:31.973 --> 56:33.554
I think the guy
that you got in your cell

56:33.724 --> 56:35.225
had the heroin
and syringes on him.

56:35.434 --> 56:38.141
I was just out there fishing
when he offered me the drugs.

56:38.354 --> 56:40.310
Yeah. I turned him
down, of course.

56:40.481 --> 56:43.268
The guy in my cell got the drugs
from your creel.

56:44.235 --> 56:47.352
No, no, no. Hold on.
Y-You found drugs in my creel?

56:47.572 --> 56:50.314
No. 'Cause you kicked it over
into the river.

56:50.533 --> 56:52.774
I'm not too sure
that I agree

56:52.994 --> 56:54.700
with your version
of events, Sheriff.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.494
I'm not too sure
a judge will, either.

56:57.707 --> 57:01.791
You know, that-- that Bronco--
that's your official police car?

57:01.961 --> 57:03.997
That is awesome.

57:04.881 --> 57:06.462
Oh, wait. No. Wait a minute.
I get it.

57:06.674 --> 57:09.711
[laughing] It's a Bronco!

57:09.927 --> 57:14.887
You're a cowboy and [laughing]
that's your horse.

57:15.099 --> 57:16.214
Yes.

57:16.434 --> 57:17.844
You really think a judge
is gonna believe

57:18.060 --> 57:19.846
your version of events?

57:20.062 --> 57:22.769
I guess it just depends on what
you can cook up against me.

57:22.982 --> 57:24.222
Oh, sweet.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.015
A "WANTED" poster.

57:26.235 --> 57:27.816
Cowboy Bill.

57:28.029 --> 57:29.860
The bank robber.

57:30.072 --> 57:31.107
Can I keep that?

57:42.960 --> 57:45.451
Hot damn.
Look at that cell.

57:45.671 --> 57:48.083
There better be a harmonica
waiting for me in there.

57:49.050 --> 57:50.085
You're next, tough guy.

57:50.301 --> 57:51.131
Come on.

57:52.428 --> 57:53.338
That way.

57:59.518 --> 58:00.382
Let's go.

58:03.856 --> 58:07.599
Guys, l-l'm sorry if I laid it
on a little th-thick out there.

58:07.818 --> 58:09.194
Truly, I respect you.

58:09.362 --> 58:10.397
I just don't want that guy

58:10.613 --> 58:12.149
to think that I'm in
on any of this.

58:12.323 --> 58:13.563
I'm pretty sure he doesn't.

58:14.283 --> 58:16.069
-So, did he confess?
-No.

58:16.243 --> 58:18.325
No, he insisted
Jamie had the drugs

58:18.537 --> 58:19.913
on him the entire time.

58:20.081 --> 58:21.287
Which doesn't matter,

58:21.499 --> 58:23.410
since we have the
transaction on tape.

58:23.626 --> 58:25.582
[Ferg] Yeah. About that.

58:25.795 --> 58:27.581
ljust listened
to the recording.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.296
[water rushing]

58:33.719 --> 58:36.256
Now we know why he wanted
to meet Jamie by the creek.

58:36.472 --> 58:38.008
Can't make out a thing
they're saying.

58:38.224 --> 58:40.465
[knock on door, door opens]

58:40.643 --> 58:41.723
[Vic] Hey.

58:44.063 --> 58:46.349
I just got off the phone
with the FBI.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.937
-What do they want?
-Eddie Harp.

58:51.153 --> 58:52.654
Soon as I punched his name
into the database,

58:52.863 --> 58:54.524
I got a phone call
from an FBI agent

58:54.740 --> 58:56.651
saying they wanted to pick him
and transport him to Montana

58:56.867 --> 58:59.324
to question him in an ongoing
federal investigation.

59:00.371 --> 59:01.611
Look.

59:01.831 --> 59:04.413
I don't like the FBI being
involved any more than you do,

59:04.625 --> 59:06.866
but maybe they've got more
on this guy than we've got.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.420
And it's never a bad idea

59:08.629 --> 59:10.494
to get a drug dealer
out of the county.

59:12.258 --> 59:14.795
-No offense, of course.
-Oh, none taken.

59:18.097 --> 59:21.635
Vic, um, tell the FBI
they can have Harp,

59:21.851 --> 59:24.058
but I'd prefer
to transport suspects myself.

59:24.270 --> 59:27.262
Walter!
Donna just called.

59:27.440 --> 59:30.307
She's found another clinic
for Billy Barnes.

59:30.526 --> 59:32.391
If you can get him there
within the hour.

59:37.450 --> 59:39.987
[Ferg] Walt.
You should go help Billy.

59:40.161 --> 59:42.447
I can drive Harp
out to the feds.

59:49.587 --> 59:52.078
The landscape out here
is stunning.

59:52.840 --> 59:53.955
It really is.

59:55.051 --> 59:58.259
The depth of color,
the scale of it all.

59:59.555 --> 1:00:02.262
Not to mention
that John Ford sky.

1:00:02.475 --> 1:00:03.464
Yep.

1:00:05.061 --> 1:00:06.642
We like it here.

1:00:06.854 --> 1:00:07.934
[Eddie] That's it.

1:00:08.147 --> 1:00:09.762
I've made up my mind.

1:00:10.566 --> 1:00:12.602
I've been threatening to take up
watercolors for years,

1:00:12.818 --> 1:00:14.319
but I'm gonna do it now.

1:00:14.528 --> 1:00:17.440
Get myself some nice brushes,
an easel.

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:20.860
What do you think?

1:00:21.994 --> 1:00:23.450
lthink...

1:00:23.662 --> 1:00:26.870
having a hobby like painting

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.116
might help pass the time
in prison.

1:00:45.434 --> 1:00:46.640
[tires squeal]

1:00:51.607 --> 1:00:52.687
That's weird.

1:01:00.908 --> 1:01:02.148
What's going on?

1:01:02.368 --> 1:01:04.233
[laughing] Who knows?

1:01:04.453 --> 1:01:06.364
It's like the Wild West
out here, ain't it?

1:01:08.582 --> 1:01:11.619
My dad
would love this.

1:01:13.629 --> 1:01:15.790
Pure Peckinpah.

1:01:20.594 --> 1:01:22.459
It's like they're
cutting you off at the pass.

1:01:26.058 --> 1:01:27.639
[guns cocking]

1:01:44.285 --> 1:01:45.900
[automatic gunfire]
