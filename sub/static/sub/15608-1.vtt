11:21.061 --> 11:26.106
(GASPS) Is that my
limited edition
Brushmaster 3000?

11:26.106 --> 11:27.938
Oh, man, I got an itch.

11:30.310 --> 11:33.073
Oh! Popped that zit!

11:33.523 --> 11:34.815
It's a gusher.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.526
(SHRIEKS)

11:41.411 --> 11:45.535
Everyone smile
and say "Hey... Zel!"

11:47.748 --> 11:49.379
(CAMERA CLICKS)

11:49.379 --> 11:52.632
This is going
on the Camp Kikiwaka FacePage,
and all over the web!

11:52.632 --> 11:56.046
I hope she's just talking
about the web she spun
in our bathroom.

11:56.046 --> 11:58.048
I hope a bullet comes out
of that camera.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.341
Got it!

12:01.341 --> 12:03.013
I'm gonna go post it.

12:03.013 --> 12:06.056
And remember, Up-Chucks,
from now on, anyone seen

12:06.056 --> 12:08.058
out of this uniform
gets a demerit.

12:08.058 --> 12:09.059
Bye!

12:10.650 --> 12:12.773
(GRUNTING)

12:12.773 --> 12:14.775
(GASPING)

12:16.156 --> 12:18.909
What happened, Reek?

12:18.909 --> 12:22.742
I fell asleep for five minutes
and those Weasel weirdos
gave me a "makeover".

12:24.244 --> 12:26.626
Okay, it's bad enough
they shot arrows at you,

12:26.626 --> 12:28.668
and turned you
into coyote bait,

12:28.668 --> 12:33.133
but when they humiliate you
with poorly applied makeup,
that's where I draw the line!

12:33.133 --> 12:34.674
Why are y'all
dressed like Hazel?

12:34.674 --> 12:37.087
Because this is
Hazel's idea of "fun".

12:37.087 --> 12:40.010
Tomorrow, we're going
to play something called
"scorpion tag".

12:41.221 --> 12:44.224
I'd cry for you,
but I have no more tears.

12:44.224 --> 12:47.227
Guys, we have to think
of a way to save Reek,

12:47.227 --> 12:49.439
and get Hazel back
to the Weasel Cabin.

12:49.439 --> 12:50.981
Could you actually do that?

12:50.981 --> 12:52.192
Is there really hope?

12:53.563 --> 12:56.026
I said "hope", not "rope".

12:56.026 --> 12:58.899
You shouldn't have
tried to escape, Reek.

12:58.899 --> 13:00.070
That was naughty.

13:00.951 --> 13:02.202
(SCREAMS)

13:10.170 --> 13:13.293
Xander, are you hiding
from Hazel again?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.045
Nope, she keeps finding me.

13:16.126 --> 13:17.717
I think she put
a chip in my neck.

13:19.339 --> 13:20.971
Have you guys
seen my guitar?

13:20.971 --> 13:22.182
Someone took Gabby!

13:22.843 --> 13:24.764
Gee, I wonder who.

13:24.764 --> 13:27.597
Maybe the guy
who showed up
in handcuffs.

13:27.597 --> 13:29.599
Is my microscope book
still here?

13:32.272 --> 13:34.144
Thank the gods!

13:34.144 --> 13:36.736
Look, I know you guys
don't trust Griff,

13:36.736 --> 13:39.279
but there's no way
he would steal my guitar.

13:39.279 --> 13:40.530
Oh, really?

13:40.530 --> 13:43.283
Then why is your guitar pick
on his bed?

13:43.283 --> 13:44.074
What?

13:46.907 --> 13:48.708
I can't believe
Griff would steal Gabby.

13:48.708 --> 13:50.450
He knows
how much I love her.

13:50.450 --> 13:52.832
He knew how much
I loved my brush,

13:52.832 --> 13:56.216
and now his back pus
is all over it!

13:56.216 --> 14:00.010
So I'm forced to use
this cheap, disgusting one.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.591
Wha... That is mine.

14:03.013 --> 14:04.844
Wait, where did it go?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.927
It's lost in my hair.

14:06.927 --> 14:09.679
It's like a curly
Bermuda Triangle up there.

14:17.067 --> 14:18.188
Action figure.

14:19.279 --> 14:20.901
Teeny-tiny car.

14:22.242 --> 14:23.613
Toothbrush.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.405
Hey, put that back in.

14:25.405 --> 14:26.786
That's where I keep it.

14:28.538 --> 14:31.331
Hey, guys. Look what I made
in arts and crafts!

14:31.331 --> 14:33.453
In juvie, we only got
to make license plates.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.496
Hey, Griff...

14:36.496 --> 14:38.418
Why was my guitar pick
on your bed?

14:38.418 --> 14:40.050
Oh... Sorry, man.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.631
I borrowed that
after we went zip-lining,

14:41.631 --> 14:44.004
to get the bugs
out of my teeth.

14:44.004 --> 14:45.385
You know, the last time
I saw my guitar,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.427
this pick was wedged
between the strings.

14:47.427 --> 14:48.598
A-ha!

14:48.598 --> 14:50.270
He did take the guitar!

14:50.270 --> 14:52.182
I say we strip search him!

14:52.182 --> 14:56.016
Dude, where exactly
do you think I'm stashing it?

14:56.016 --> 14:58.068
I'm really disappointed
in you, Griff.

14:58.068 --> 14:59.859
I flipped a lot of burgers
to buy Gabby.

14:59.859 --> 15:03.573
And it took a long time,
'cause I kept flipped
most of them on the floor.

15:03.573 --> 15:06.286
Xander, I did not
take the guitar!

15:06.286 --> 15:09.159
Look, I want to believe you,

15:09.159 --> 15:13.033
but in these situations,
camp tradition dictates
that we do a Trial by Fire.

15:13.033 --> 15:14.164
You're going to burn me?

15:15.165 --> 15:16.536
No!

15:16.536 --> 15:18.838
We're just going
to have a little trial
by the camp fire.

15:18.838 --> 15:21.251
You know, we really
should change that name.

15:24.384 --> 15:27.137
Ew, ew, ew!

15:27.137 --> 15:29.259
You're not even
touching the rat!

15:29.259 --> 15:31.141
I know, but that cheese
is not low fat.

15:37.147 --> 15:40.981
Okay, Operation
"Rat Under the Quilt
To Get Rid of Hazel" is ready.

15:42.402 --> 15:43.903
What's going on here?

15:43.903 --> 15:46.196
Hazel, there's a rat
in our cabin!

15:46.196 --> 15:49.829
Yeah, it's the second
most disgusting thing
that's moved in this week.

15:51.371 --> 15:52.912
It's in your bed!

15:55.335 --> 15:56.666
(SQUEAKS)

15:57.457 --> 15:58.878
(HISSES)

15:58.878 --> 15:59.959
(SQUEAKING)

16:03.343 --> 16:04.924
Problem solved!

16:08.388 --> 16:10.640
I can't believe
she scared that rat.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.472
I can't believe
she ate that cheese!

16:15.435 --> 16:18.148
I can't believe
everyone thinks
I stole that guitar!

16:18.148 --> 16:19.899
Well...

16:19.899 --> 16:22.772
Your resume does include...
How shall I put it...
Stealing.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.236
So that automatically
makes me a thief?

16:26.236 --> 16:27.777
Well...

16:27.777 --> 16:30.320
Technically...
And legally... Yes.

16:31.571 --> 16:36.416
If I may ask,
why did you
start stealing things?

16:36.416 --> 16:38.668
(SIGHS) I don't know.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.711
When I was growing up,
there wasn't always
enough food,

16:41.711 --> 16:44.504
so I borrowed some
from the grocery store.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.715
Oh...

16:45.715 --> 16:47.677
So, you were just
trying to survive?

16:47.677 --> 16:49.509
Exactly.

16:49.509 --> 16:55.935
But they put me in juvie
after I borrowed a skateboard,
a TV, a motorcycle...

16:55.935 --> 16:59.479
You are really playing
fast and loose
with the word "borrow".

16:59.479 --> 17:02.352
Hey, you don't
get to judge me!

17:02.352 --> 17:04.274
You have no idea
what I've been through,

17:04.274 --> 17:06.406
what it's like to have
your parents abandon you.

17:07.907 --> 17:14.534
Actually, I lived in
an orphanage in India
until I was 10.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.157
So...

17:17.157 --> 17:21.581
I do know what it is like
to be poor, and feel unwanted.

17:21.581 --> 17:23.123
So you weren't always rich?

17:23.123 --> 17:24.504
No.

17:24.504 --> 17:28.218
But, unlike you,

17:28.218 --> 17:30.300
I never resorted to stealing.

17:30.300 --> 17:34.174
Okay, I know I haven't made
the best choices in the past,

17:34.174 --> 17:37.767
but I was really hoping
to put that all behind me.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.439
I understand.

17:39.439 --> 17:42.272
I have made mistakes
in my past
I wish I could take back.

17:42.272 --> 17:43.483
Really?

17:43.483 --> 17:45.485
You've been arrested?

17:45.485 --> 17:47.857
No, but I was once
penalized with quite
a hefty library fine.

17:49.859 --> 17:51.781
You're pretty hardcore, Rav.

17:51.781 --> 17:53.493
That is also
what the librarian said.

17:54.654 --> 17:56.406
Huh.

17:56.406 --> 17:58.828
Who would have thought
you and I would have
so much in common?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.500
I know.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.791
It's too bad they're gonna
kick me out,

18:01.791 --> 18:04.504
because I was really starting
to like it here,

18:05.705 --> 18:08.628
even you and your dumb face.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.422
Sorry, still working
on my people skills.

18:16.806 --> 18:18.178
Reek, heel!

18:19.269 --> 18:20.350
Sit!

18:23.723 --> 18:26.316
You can do
your stupid judge thing,

18:26.316 --> 18:29.569
but you better be back
in half an hour.

18:29.569 --> 18:31.361
The hole will be dug by then.

18:36.656 --> 18:38.368
What's the hole for?

18:38.368 --> 18:39.739
For me...

18:39.739 --> 18:41.241
And the snakes.

18:43.663 --> 18:45.375
Are you aware
there's a rat
on your shoulder?

18:46.876 --> 18:48.298
Yep.

18:48.298 --> 18:52.172
At first he was scared of me,
but now we're besties.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.054
I finally found someone
who gets me.

18:57.347 --> 18:59.559
So, judges,
let's get this started.

19:01.471 --> 19:05.565
Hear me, hear me!
Let the trial begin!

19:05.565 --> 19:10.440
Griff, you stand accused
of stealing Gabby the guitar,
which you obviously did.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.612
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

19:12.612 --> 19:15.575
What's the point?
You all think
I'm guilty anyway.

19:15.575 --> 19:17.036
Griff, if you won't
defend yourself,

19:17.036 --> 19:18.618
then we have no choice...
Wait!

19:21.541 --> 19:25.455
Distinguished judges,
counselors, Hazel's rat...

19:27.247 --> 19:29.959
I know Griff has
a checkered past.

19:29.959 --> 19:32.462
In fact, he has
a long history of theft,

19:32.462 --> 19:35.174
including watches,
a skateboard, a motorcycle,

19:35.174 --> 19:37.717
which he clearly was
not licensed to operate...

19:37.717 --> 19:39.469
Dude, what are you doing?

19:39.469 --> 19:40.560
I'm defending you.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.602
Not very well!

19:42.602 --> 19:45.184
You're worse than
my last public defender.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.016
And I found him
on a bus bench.

19:47.016 --> 19:48.478
Oh, he was advertising
on a bus bench?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.570
No, he was sleeping on it.

19:52.272 --> 19:54.023
Anyhoo...

19:54.023 --> 19:56.696
What is a criminal?

19:56.696 --> 20:00.660
The word is derived
from the Latin word,
criminalis, which means...

20:00.660 --> 20:03.493
Can we kick Ravi
out of camp, too?

20:03.493 --> 20:06.666
If he doesn't get
to the point quick, yes.

20:06.666 --> 20:12.752
My point is, Griff came
to Camp Kikiwaka hoping
for a fresh start.

20:12.752 --> 20:16.546
More than anything,
he just wanted to be
part of a family.

20:16.546 --> 20:19.799
And he was starting
to find that here, with us.

20:19.799 --> 20:23.182
I do not believe he would do
anything to jeopardize that.

20:23.182 --> 20:26.556
Ergo, he did not
steal Xander's guitar.

20:27.687 --> 20:29.899
Thanks, Ravi.

20:29.899 --> 20:32.562
Nobody's ever stuck up
for me like that before.

20:32.562 --> 20:33.903
Or used the word "ergo".

20:35.565 --> 20:37.066
Who cares?

20:37.066 --> 20:38.658
He's guilty!

20:38.658 --> 20:40.490
Throw him in the hole
with Lou and the snakes!

20:41.911 --> 20:43.493
Hold on.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.625
If Griff didn't
take my guitar,
then who did?

20:45.625 --> 20:48.578
(DOOR SLAMS)
Wait, don't cook that camper!

20:48.578 --> 20:52.672
We're not!
It's just a barbecue
for afterwards!

20:52.672 --> 20:57.136
I told the girls
about Xander's missing guitar,
and they found it!

20:57.136 --> 20:59.299
It was under Hazel's bed!

20:59.299 --> 21:00.640
(GASPS)

21:00.640 --> 21:03.513
Yeah, we found it when we were
planting explos...

21:04.724 --> 21:06.806
I mean, cleaning up.

21:08.348 --> 21:11.351
Hazel! You took
Xander's guitar?

21:11.351 --> 21:16.065
She looks guiltier than I did
when I finally returned
that library book!

21:16.065 --> 21:20.900
Okay, okay, I took
Xander's stupid guitar.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.573
How dare you love Gabby
more than you love me!

21:23.573 --> 21:25.204
I don't love you at all!

21:25.204 --> 21:26.746
Body-pillow Xander does!

21:26.746 --> 21:28.788
And he doesn't mind
when I drool on him!

21:28.788 --> 21:29.829
ALL: Ew!

21:31.791 --> 21:37.046
Look, Griff, I am really sorry
I didn't believe you.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.629
You're a good kid,
and if you still want
to stay at camp,

21:40.800 --> 21:43.092
I'd be proud to have you
as a Grizzly.

21:43.092 --> 21:44.263
That'd be cool, man.

21:45.845 --> 21:48.267
I'm really glad
you're staying, dude...

21:48.267 --> 21:52.482
But if you touch
my hair curlers,
it's go time.

21:52.482 --> 21:54.644
I'll try to restrain myself.

21:54.644 --> 21:59.649
Okay, guys, let us
celebrate by giving Griff
a big Grizzly Cabin bear hug!

22:03.613 --> 22:04.704
Hazel!

22:04.704 --> 22:06.245
How does she do that?

22:06.245 --> 22:08.327
Release!
Never!

22:08.327 --> 22:09.999
Emma, go get
your pepper spray.

22:14.914 --> 22:18.127
Oh! It's so great to have
everything back to normal.

22:18.127 --> 22:19.669
Welcome home, Woody!

22:19.669 --> 22:20.550
(IN DEEP VOICE)
Thanks, Lou.

22:22.051 --> 22:24.724
Well, as normal
as it gets around here.

22:24.724 --> 22:26.426
We're glad you're back, Lou.

22:26.426 --> 22:28.638
Yup, right where I belong.
Up to my cheeks in Chucks!

22:30.770 --> 22:31.931
Hey, whose ribbon is that?

22:31.931 --> 22:33.232
Don't touch that!

22:35.354 --> 22:36.566
Hey!

22:36.566 --> 22:38.738
Where's all my stuff?

22:38.738 --> 22:41.861
Sorry, Hazel, but you're
back in Weasel Cabin.
Effective immediately.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.614
What?
You can't make me move!

22:44.614 --> 22:47.036
Sure we can.
Unless you want us
to tell Gladys

22:47.036 --> 22:49.539
you stole
another counselor's
property...

22:49.539 --> 22:51.991
And framed
an innocent camper.

22:51.991 --> 22:53.753
Okay, you can make me.

22:53.753 --> 22:55.164
But this isn't over.

22:55.164 --> 22:58.668
You haven't seen
the last of Hazel Swearengen!

23:00.339 --> 23:02.091
Uh-oh. (SCREAMS)

23:04.504 --> 23:05.715
Those Weasels are freaks,

23:05.715 --> 23:08.217
but their timing
is impeccable.

23:08.217 --> 23:09.469
Woodchuck salute?

23:09.469 --> 23:11.140
(ALL CHITTERING)

23:11.140 --> 23:14.684
Hey, Tiffany, show them
the cab driver salute
I taught you.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.726
Okay!
No, no, no, no.
