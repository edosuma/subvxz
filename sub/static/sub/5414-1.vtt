00:51.017 --> 00:52.382
Mr. Cox?

00:53.186 --> 00:55.051
Mr. Cox?

00:56.523 --> 00:58.252
Mr. Cox?

00:59.259 --> 01:01.989
Guys, I need Cox.

01:03.696 --> 01:07.223
He goes on in two minutes
and I can't find him.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.096
Mr. Cox.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.175
Mr. Cox?

01:17.677 --> 01:20.373
You're gonna have to give him
a moment, son.

01:20.580 --> 01:25.142
Dewey Cox needs to think about
his entire life before he plays.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.644
Come on, Nate, let's go play.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.079
I can't, Dewey. I gotta practice.

01:58.284 --> 02:02.084
You can't practice all the time, Nate.
You're already perfect.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.916
All right. Come on, Dewey,
let's go play!

02:05.125 --> 02:07.491
-Today's gonna be the best day ever!
-Yeah!

02:07.694 --> 02:10.424
Ain't nothing horrible
gonna happen today.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.157
What do you wanna be
when you grow up, Dewey?

02:14.367 --> 02:17.063
I don't know. Never really
thunk about it before.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.932
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a great composer.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.074
And a professional baseball player.

02:22.275 --> 02:26.109
Then I'm gonna be an astronaut,
and I'm gonna go to the moon.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.179
There's nothing I won't do
with this long, long life of mine.

02:29.582 --> 02:30.708
For sure.

02:30.917 --> 02:34.648
That's what's great about being young.
So much time to do great things.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.879
Let's go play!

02:42.495 --> 02:43.894
My turn!

02:48.368 --> 02:50.302
I got him! I got him!

02:50.503 --> 02:51.561
Catch!

02:53.840 --> 02:55.205
Chicken!

03:14.894 --> 03:17.055
I challenge you to a duel, sir.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.525
I don't know, Nate.

03:18.731 --> 03:21.564
You know how mad Pa gets
when we play with his machetes.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.862
Come on. There's nothing wrong
with a little machete-fighting.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.369
Now, en garde!

03:30.677 --> 03:33.077
-Do you yield, sir?
-Never!

03:35.782 --> 03:37.545
Prepare to meet your maker.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.587
-Dewey!
-Nate!

03:50.263 --> 03:51.389
I'm halved!

03:51.598 --> 03:53.259
Oh, we should've listened to Pa.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.491
Dewey, I'm cut in half pretty bad.

03:56.369 --> 04:00.362
In case I don't make it,
then you'll have to be double great...

04:00.573 --> 04:02.063
...for the both of us.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.468
Wow, that's a lot of pressure, Nate.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.043
You can handle it, Dewey.
Now, run, get Pa!

04:11.584 --> 04:12.915
Holy shit.

04:17.055 --> 04:21.618
This was a particularly bad case
of somebody being cut in half.

04:22.195 --> 04:27.132
I was not able to reattach
the top half of his body...

04:27.333 --> 04:29.164
...to the bottom half of his body.

04:29.535 --> 04:32.936
Speak English, doc!
We ain't scientists.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.240
I'm sorry, folks. He's gone.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.999
Oh, no!

04:37.210 --> 04:38.575
Oh, my God.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.042
Dear God. Oh, Dewey.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.010
It's all your fault, Dewey Cox.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.379
Oh, Pa, you don't mean that.
It's not his fault.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.880
He cut him in half with a machete.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.147
No.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.155
You. You're not half the boy
that Nate was.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.329
You're not even half the boy
that the top half of Nate was...

04:57.530 --> 04:59.293
...after you cut him in half.

04:59.499 --> 05:03.230
So you're saying I'm less than
a quarter of the boy Nate was?

05:04.404 --> 05:06.929
The wrong kid died.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.541
Ma, I can't smell anything.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.641
You can't smell anything?

05:14.981 --> 05:17.313
I think I lost my sense of smell.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.849
You gone smell-blind, son.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.648
It'll pass, Dewey.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.323
Now, you run on down to the country
store and get us some butter.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.088
And a candle.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.661
We're gonna light us
a candle tonight.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.408
I'm a gamblin' man

05:48.781 --> 05:50.874
I gambled everywhere I go

05:53.186 --> 05:55.245
Lord, I'm a gamblin' man

05:57.290 --> 06:00.225
Gambled everywhere I go

06:04.497 --> 06:05.930
I'm a gamblin' man

06:08.334 --> 06:10.996
Lord, I gambled from door to door

06:34.160 --> 06:37.061
I've never heard no music
like that before.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.128
It's so sad.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.357
That's why it's called the blues, boy.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.131
I think I'd like to play me
some blues.

06:44.337 --> 06:48.865
Ain't no 6-year-old boy understand
the true meaning of the blues.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.134
I reckon I might.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.011
You play the guitar?

06:53.212 --> 06:56.306
Never have before.
But I'm a real fast learner.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.108
Well, go ahead.

07:01.521 --> 07:05.924
You put your finger right up there.
Place your hands here. That's it.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.251
That's the G chord.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.821
Now hit the strings
with your other hand.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.401
-That's it.
-There you go.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.178
That ain't bad.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.975
I done a bad thing

07:35.721 --> 07:39.179
Cut my brother in half

07:44.297 --> 07:48.427
I done a bad, bad thing

07:50.102 --> 07:53.538
Cut my brother in half

07:59.812 --> 08:03.771
My mama's gonna cry

08:04.383 --> 08:09.514
Somewhere the devil's havin' a laugh

08:11.991 --> 08:13.686
It's not bad for your first time.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.888
You can do it, Dewey.
You'll be double great.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.088
For the both of us.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.107
Dewey?

08:36.916 --> 08:39.043
Dewey.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.745
Dewey?

08:43.489 --> 08:44.979
Mama, you made it!

08:45.191 --> 08:47.682
There's my favorite 1 4-year-old son.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.557
Oh, no. Come on, now.
Not in front of the fellas.

08:51.764 --> 08:52.822
Howdy, boys.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.761
Howdy, Mrs. Cox.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.457
I just wanted to say break a leg.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.035
I know you boys are gonna
play a real good song.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.466
Oh, thanks, Ma.

09:00.673 --> 09:04.074
I'm just so proud you learned to play
the guitar so good.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.035
Without even having
a sense of smell.

09:07.246 --> 09:10.147
It's all right now, Mama.
I learned how to play by ear.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.442
You just go out there
and sing your heart out.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.415
I will, Mama.

09:15.421 --> 09:18.754
I don't know what we're doing here
at this high school talent show.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.984
We're here to see our boy,
that's what we're doing here.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.023
You all right, ma'am?

09:28.100 --> 09:29.931
I'm fine.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.670
Just my vertigo acting up again.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.932
-What's vertigo?
-Just a little dizziness is all.

09:37.476 --> 09:40.001
Ain't nothing terrible
ever came from no dizziness.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.481
Testing, testing.

09:42.682 --> 09:45.207
Crawdad, crawdad.

09:46.218 --> 09:49.676
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the annual talent show.

09:49.889 --> 09:55.191
We're gonna get this going here with
the juggling talents of Johnny McGraw.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.448
-How we gonna follow that?
-Delilah Montgomery.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.020
-Delilah Montgomery.
-Very nice!

10:25.691 --> 10:28.455
And now sophomore Dewey Cox
is gonna sing us a song.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.458
So, ladies and germs....

10:32.531 --> 10:34.226
I know, I know.

10:34.433 --> 10:38.301
Please welcome Dewey Cox
and the Dewey Cox Four.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.674
Hi. My name's Dewey Cox.

10:51.884 --> 10:55.342
And this is a little song I wrote called
"Take My Hand."

10:55.554 --> 10:56.919
I sure hope you like it.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.320
The wrong kid died, goddamn it.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.266
-Take
-Take, take

11:08.467 --> 11:10.401
Take my hand

11:10.603 --> 11:11.763
Take my hand

11:11.971 --> 11:14.405
We're gonna walk through the park

11:15.574 --> 11:19.977
I promise to have you
Home before dark

11:20.446 --> 11:22.380
Home before dark

11:22.581 --> 11:25.550
Oh, life would be so sweet

11:26.152 --> 11:29.212
Walking with you down the street

11:30.322 --> 11:32.222
This music is an outrage!

11:32.692 --> 11:34.717
Come on and take my hand

11:34.927 --> 11:36.656
Come on and take my hand

11:36.862 --> 11:38.921
It's the devil's music!

11:39.131 --> 11:42.589
It's all right if you're coy

11:42.802 --> 11:46.670
After all I'm a boy

11:46.872 --> 11:48.339
And you're a girl

11:48.541 --> 11:50.736
But make no mistake

11:51.077 --> 11:54.513
Yours is the hand
I want to take

11:54.714 --> 11:56.306
So please

11:56.515 --> 11:58.506
So please, please

11:58.718 --> 12:00.618
Take my hand

12:00.820 --> 12:02.014
You're going to hell!

12:02.488 --> 12:04.683
Blasphemer!

12:08.794 --> 12:11.592
That's it. I want you
out of this house, boy.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.197
-Pa!
-You heard the preacher.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.925
You think we don't know
what you're talking about...

12:17.136 --> 12:18.569
...when you say "take my hand"?

12:18.771 --> 12:20.363
What? It's about holding hands.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.562
You watch your mouth.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.834
You know who's got hands?
The devil.

12:25.044 --> 12:27.069
And he uses them for holding.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.483
I ain't got no room in my house
for no devil's spawn.

12:31.684 --> 12:35.984
Be careful. Before you say something
you regret for the rest of your days.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.748
Like what?
Like "the wrong kid died"?

12:38.958 --> 12:40.050
Oh, no! No!

12:40.259 --> 12:43.126
It's okay.
It's okay, Mama, settle down.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.124
Pa's right.

12:45.998 --> 12:49.126
Springberry ain't big enough
for me no more.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.128
I reckon it's time for Dewey Cox
to move on.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.097
But you're only 1 4.

12:55.307 --> 12:57.741
Mama, I love you.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.939
But I don't need nobody.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.275
All I need is my music.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.984
I seen my path today,
and I'm gonna take it.

13:07.186 --> 13:10.644
And someday,
I'll make my masterpiece...

13:10.856 --> 13:13.586
...and you'll all be proud of me.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.488
Just like you were of Nate.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.893
Can I come, Dewey?

13:18.097 --> 13:20.759
Of course you can, Edith.
You're my girlfriend.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.490
-I am?
-Yeah, silly.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.931
I pointed at you in the audience.

13:25.704 --> 13:29.697
Did you hear that?
I'm Dewey's 1 2-year-old girlfriend!

13:29.909 --> 13:32.673
You're the most talented man
I've ever seen in my whole life.

13:32.878 --> 13:36.609
And you will never get anything
but love and support from me...

13:36.816 --> 13:39.683
...for you and your dreams
the rest of my life.

13:39.885 --> 13:43.116
Well, then, go on.
Get out of this house.

13:43.322 --> 13:47.691
Before I cut your dreams in half
like you cut mine in half.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.793
Goodbye, Pa.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.829
Just wait till you see
what happens now.

13:56.635 --> 13:58.296
Here we go.

13:59.638 --> 14:02.106
Ma and Pa leave home
All the kids get glad

14:02.308 --> 14:04.139
You know our house's
Gonna jump like mad

14:04.343 --> 14:06.436
We're gonna jump, li'l children, jump

14:06.645 --> 14:08.636

Play it for me, daddy!

14:32.771 --> 14:35.740
That's a sexy look right there.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.467
Oh, I like it, I like it.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.941
Let's jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

You know what I'm saying.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.290
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa 's gone

14:56.495 --> 14:58.122
Let's take them home, fellas.

14:58.330 --> 15:02.494
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

15:04.837 --> 15:06.566
Yeah, baby. Wrap it up right there.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.471
I'm gonna take one of them
home tonight.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.143
My name is Bobby Shad
and these are the Bad Men.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.505
We gonna take a break,
then we be right back...

15:14.713 --> 15:17.307
...to rock till the morning light,
all right?

15:20.152 --> 15:23.519
Mr. Shad! Mr. Shad!
Wow, that was really great.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.849
Hey, I play a little guitar.
If you ever need--

15:26.058 --> 15:28.322
-Dewey!
-Yes, sir?

15:28.527 --> 15:30.427
I pay you to mop,
not bother the band.

15:30.629 --> 15:34.588
My customers come to dance erotically,
and they need a clean floor to do it on!

15:34.800 --> 15:36.791
Do your job or I'll find
somebody who will.

15:37.002 --> 15:38.594
Yes, sir.

15:45.945 --> 15:46.934
Lonesome blues

15:47.146 --> 15:50.274
Dewey, will you cut out that racket?
I'm trying to feed your child!

15:51.016 --> 15:54.213
How am I supposed to make it as
a famous musician if I don't practice?

15:54.420 --> 15:56.752
Will you stop talking
about that music?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.423
But it's my dream, baby.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.922
I am tired of hearing about
your dreams, Dewey Cox.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.253
You are a selfish dickhole.

16:03.662 --> 16:07.894
Daddy said if we move home, he could
give you a job at the slaughterhouse.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.624
You can make an honest living.

16:09.835 --> 16:13.896
Wouldn't have to hang your head in
shame, walking around like a failure.

16:14.106 --> 16:17.075
I think I'm doing okay for a 1 5-year-old
with a wife and a baby.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.834
But, sweetheart...

16:19.044 --> 16:22.912
...I thought you liked working
at the slaughterhouse for my daddy.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.514
I did.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.745
You got a real talent for this, boy.

16:29.955 --> 16:33.755
Someday this is all gonna be yours.

16:34.727 --> 16:39.289
It's just, as much as I loved it, Edith,
I want more than that.

16:39.498 --> 16:43.025
Ain't no musician ever made
no money, Dewey.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.962
What? Of course they do.
Plenty of them do.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.433
Name one.

16:49.575 --> 16:51.736
-Slim Whitman.
-Who the hell is Slim Whitman?

16:51.944 --> 16:53.411
All right, Frank Sinatra.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.007
Who the hell is Frank Sinatra?

16:56.215 --> 16:58.979
Edith, I am starting to think...

17:00.052 --> 17:01.986
...that maybe
you don't believe in me.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.185
I do believe in you.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.255
I just know you're gonna fail.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.184
-What are you talking about, Edith?
-What about my dreams?

17:10.396 --> 17:13.092
Edith, I told you,
I can't build you a candy house!

17:13.298 --> 17:16.597
It will fall down! The sun will
melt the candy! It won't work!

17:16.801 --> 17:18.201
It will if it never rains.

17:18.936 --> 17:22.270
Dewey, you have got
to give up your dream.

17:24.276 --> 17:27.608
Dreams don't come true.

17:32.251 --> 17:35.049
I am gonna make
this dream come true.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.518
Nobody ever said it's gonna be easy.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.781
It's hard.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.749
It ain't easy to walk
to the top of a mountain.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.258
It's a long, hard walk.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.432
It's a rocky road.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.430
But I plan on walking.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.169
Oh, I'm gonna walk.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.669
Hard.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.934
I will walk hard.

18:03.382 --> 18:06.909
Walk hard.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.757
I got a full house coming tonight.

18:13.959 --> 18:16.519
If Bobby Shad can't play
I need to find someone who can.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.958
I'm fine. I can play through the pain.

18:19.164 --> 18:22.463
Should've thought before you punched
your landlord and got laryngitis.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.295
I guess there's no music tonight.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.802
Bullhickey! People come here
to dance erotically!

18:28.006 --> 18:30.668
I ain't got no music,
I ain't got no nightclub.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.840
Excuse me.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.172
I play a little.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.872
I don't know how
to tell you this, boy.

18:39.084 --> 18:42.247
You're white.
This crowd will eat you alive.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.015
I been watching Mr. Shad every night.
I know all the songs.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.385
It'll be the same show.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.892
It'll be just like Bobby Shad and the
Bad Men, only it'll be me tonight.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.663
This is crazy.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.696
But I ain't got no other choice.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.499
I don't mean to put more
pressure on you, boy.

19:03.709 --> 19:07.110
The suits from the record company
just got here.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.242
Oh, okay.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.117
Scared?

19:16.622 --> 19:18.522
-A little.
-Well, you should be.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.988
Those Jews control show business.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.787
Just lay it down
exactly like Bobby does.

19:26.431 --> 19:30.390
Good evening. We're Bobby Shad
and the Bad Men. I'm Dewey Cox.

19:30.602 --> 19:34.231
Bobby Shad couldn't be here tonight
so I'm gonna do his show for you.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.304
And I hope you enjoy it.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.641
This first song
we're fitting to do is....

19:41.847 --> 19:43.576
Well, it's about....

19:44.917 --> 19:47.249
It's about when your woman
catches you.

19:47.452 --> 19:50.353
You know, she catches you
running around town...

19:50.556 --> 19:52.751
...getting into all kinds of strange.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.425
This is racially insensitive.

19:54.626 --> 19:59.723
And she says, "Son, get your lazy,
two-timing, Negro ass up out of here."

20:00.432 --> 20:02.923
-And you say to her:
-What's he doing? You see that?

20:03.635 --> 20:05.796
You got to love your Negro man

20:06.271 --> 20:08.569
You got to love your Negro man

20:09.074 --> 20:11.565
You got to love your Negro man

20:11.777 --> 20:13.972
You got to love your Negro man

20:14.479 --> 20:15.673
You got to love, love

20:15.881 --> 20:18.372
-ls he playing "Negro Man"?
-He is playing "Negro Man."

20:18.584 --> 20:20.074
He's playing "Negro Man."

20:20.285 --> 20:22.845
From early in the morning
Till late at night

20:23.055 --> 20:25.523
You know I love your apples
Let me take a bite

20:25.724 --> 20:27.954
You got to love your Negro man

20:28.160 --> 20:30.594
You got to love your Negro man

20:30.796 --> 20:33.094
You got to love, love, love, love, love

20:33.298 --> 20:35.027
Your Negro man

20:35.234 --> 20:36.599
Yeah, come on, Dewey.

20:36.802 --> 20:38.963
I know I treat you wrong
And that ain't right

20:39.171 --> 20:41.662
Let me put it on you, mama
And you'll feel all right

20:41.873 --> 20:44.273
You got to love your Negro man

20:44.476 --> 20:46.967
You got to love your Negro man

20:47.312 --> 20:49.576
You got to love, love, love, love, love

20:49.781 --> 20:51.772
Your Negro man

21:01.827 --> 21:05.285
Now, that's what I call
winning over an audience.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.592
Go, Dewey, go.

21:14.740 --> 21:18.699
I like what you did out there tonight.
Have you ever made a recording?

21:19.177 --> 21:22.305
Oh, Mr. L'Chaim, Mr. Mazeltov,
that's been my dream.

21:22.514 --> 21:25.278
He's not the one you want.
I'm the one you want.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.214
-I think he's the one we want.
-He's got a nice thing.

21:28.420 --> 21:31.981
He's not bad with the singing and the
playing and the shaking of the tochis.

21:32.324 --> 21:36.192
I think you've got what it takes
to make it in the big time.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.220
The big time?

21:39.965 --> 21:44.095
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie

21:44.303 --> 21:45.895
That's amore

21:46.104 --> 21:48.072
When the world seems to shine

21:48.273 --> 21:49.297
What the hell is this?

21:49.508 --> 21:52.204
Pizza pie. What's in a pizza pie?

21:52.878 --> 21:56.006
Bells will ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling

21:56.214 --> 21:59.012
And you'll sing "Vita bella"

21:59.217 --> 22:01.412
Hearts will play
Tippy-tippy-tay

22:01.620 --> 22:03.588
Please, I can't anymore.

22:06.591 --> 22:07.785
That's what I was gonna say.

22:07.993 --> 22:13.795
-That's amore
-Amore

22:19.738 --> 22:21.706
That is amore

22:21.907 --> 22:25.001
All right. Hold, please. Stop that.
Stop your singing!

22:25.210 --> 22:27.269
Stop your singing this instant,
young man!

22:27.479 --> 22:29.743
I will not have this in my studio!

22:30.015 --> 22:32.313
That's just a terrible, terrible...

22:32.517 --> 22:36.647
...terrible, terrible "That's Amore."

22:37.022 --> 22:39.252
Maybe it was a wrong song choice?

22:39.458 --> 22:43.588
If you just let me play one of my songs,
I think you'll like it a whole lot better.

22:43.795 --> 22:47.322
You have failed conclusively.
It's over.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.500
And there is nothing
that you can do...

22:49.701 --> 22:52.431
...here in this room
that can turn that around.

22:52.637 --> 22:56.403
Nothing you can do that can make up
for what you did to "That's Amore."

22:56.742 --> 22:59.677
-Well, my mother liked it a whole lot.
-Your mother was wrong.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.541
I was willing to open my mind...

23:02.748 --> 23:05.649
...because these Jewish gentlemen
brought you in here.

23:05.851 --> 23:07.648
They usually have good taste.

23:07.953 --> 23:11.389
And now here you are in front of me
pretending you can sing.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.717
And I have to say that today...

23:13.925 --> 23:17.292
...your performance has shaken
my belief in the Jewish people.

23:17.496 --> 23:19.691
Well, there's nothing
I would like more, sir...

23:19.898 --> 23:23.595
...than to restore your faith in Judaism,
if you could just give me that shot.

23:23.802 --> 23:25.929
But I'll tell you,
you have failed so far...

23:26.138 --> 23:29.904
...and if somehow you are able
to sing a song now...

23:30.108 --> 23:32.633
...bringing these boys together
you haven't even met...

23:33.278 --> 23:35.405
...and make something
so personal, so new...

23:35.881 --> 23:37.849
...that the whole world takes notice...

23:38.049 --> 23:40.950
...and that your life
is never the same again....

23:41.319 --> 23:45.619
But I'm telling you right now,
I don't think it's going to happen.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.989
Wait, wait, wait. We're here already.
What could it possibly hurt?

23:50.929 --> 23:53.489
L'Chaim, I'll do it for you.
But just one more song.

23:53.698 --> 23:55.256
All right.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.668
All right, son. I'm gonna
give you 1 5 more seconds.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.701
Thank you, sir.
I hope you won't regret it.

24:06.978 --> 24:09.173
Dewey, we don't know this song.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.541
You just follow me.

24:12.751 --> 24:13.843
I don't know.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.768
Walk hard

24:34.473 --> 24:35.565
Hard

24:35.774 --> 24:36.968
Walk hard?

24:37.175 --> 24:40.269
Down life's rocky road

24:42.347 --> 24:44.008
Walk bold

24:45.383 --> 24:46.680
Hard

24:47.486 --> 24:49.920
That's my creed

24:50.589 --> 24:52.648
My code

24:52.858 --> 24:56.225
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

24:57.696 --> 25:01.029
Had to struggle every day
My whole life through

25:02.167 --> 25:05.603
Seen my share of the worst
That the world can give

25:06.671 --> 25:11.267
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

25:11.676 --> 25:13.371
Walk hard

25:14.479 --> 25:15.776
Hard

25:17.115 --> 25:19.777
Here is America's new hit song
"Walk Hard"...

25:19.985 --> 25:23.284
...recorded just 35 minutes ago
by Dewey Cox.

25:24.389 --> 25:26.118
Hard

25:26.458 --> 25:28.449
Though they say

25:28.660 --> 25:31.390
You're not the one

25:31.596 --> 25:34.929
Even if you've been told
Time and time again

25:35.934 --> 25:39.495
That you're always gonna lose
And never gonna win

25:40.572 --> 25:43.336
You gotta keep that vision
In your mind's eye

25:44.876 --> 25:49.336
When you're standin' on top
Of a mountain high

25:57.722 --> 25:59.713
He walks so hard.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.358
How do I walk, boys?

26:02.427 --> 26:03.860
Hard

26:07.098 --> 26:09.999
When I meet my maker
On my dying day

26:11.303 --> 26:14.101
I'm gonna look him in the eye
And by God, I'll say

26:15.740 --> 26:19.005
I gave my word
And my word was good

26:19.911 --> 26:23.210
I took it in the face
And I walked as hard as I could

26:23.415 --> 26:26.350
Oh, hey, Shorty. Hello, my darling.

26:26.551 --> 26:29.179
I sang a song at a circus
in New Jersey.

26:29.387 --> 26:31.184
They said, "We'll give you 5 grand."

26:31.389 --> 26:34.051
I said, "No, you won't.
You'll give me that giraffe."

26:34.292 --> 26:37.989
-And they did. They gave it right to me.
-That is one beautiful giraffe.

26:38.196 --> 26:39.185
Thank you.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.626
It'll just be a few weeks, Edith.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.926
Who's gonna help me
take care of the children?

26:44.135 --> 26:46.626
Dewey, you have got to
give up this dream.

26:46.838 --> 26:49.932
You're never gonna make it.
Give it up, Dewey.

26:50.241 --> 26:54.109
What are you talking about?
I got a number one hit on the radio.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.542
I'm playing my music
for people who wanna hear me.

26:56.748 --> 26:58.545
It's everything we always wanted,
Edith.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.981
I never get to see you anymore.
Your kids never get to see you.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.379
I don't know how to tell you this.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.113
I'm gonna miss some things, okay?

27:06.324 --> 27:08.792
I'm gonna miss some birthdays
and some christenings.

27:08.994 --> 27:10.689
I'm gonna miss some births, period.

27:10.895 --> 27:14.023
Unrealistic to think I'm gonna be
here every time you have a baby.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.666
But aren't you happy?
You have a beautiful new home.

27:17.869 --> 27:20.599
All your fancy new clothes
and your monkey and your giraffe.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.973
Look, what else you need?

27:23.174 --> 27:26.974
How about I get you
a crow that could talk?

27:27.278 --> 27:30.611
And I'll teach him phrases that I say.
"Good morning, honey."

27:30.815 --> 27:34.512
-But it'll be a little crow talking.
-This ain't about no exotic pets!

27:34.719 --> 27:37.779
It's about love,
you stupid piece of shit.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.116
-Dewey.
-Edith!

27:40.325 --> 27:42.793
Don't you go in the bathroom.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.962
Edith, please.

27:45.163 --> 27:48.326
Mama said there's a lot of evil
on the road.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.364
Temptations.

27:50.568 --> 27:53.093
They'll make a man do evil things.

27:53.304 --> 27:58.469
Edith, that is ridiculous.
Is that what this is all about?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.907
There ain't no evil out there.

28:01.446 --> 28:03.744
Come on, now, cupcake,
open the door.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.215
Edith.

28:09.888 --> 28:15.224
My beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful angel.

28:18.763 --> 28:21.288
You know how much I love you.

28:21.966 --> 28:23.934
You and this fast-growing family
of ours...

28:24.135 --> 28:26.103
...is the only thing
that matters to me.

28:26.304 --> 28:27.828
You understand that?

28:28.039 --> 28:32.840
Heck, life without you
would be like no life at all.

28:35.013 --> 28:38.380
Like no life at all.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.347
Where's a pencil? Where's a pencil?

28:41.553 --> 28:44.420
Dewey!

28:46.024 --> 28:47.116
Hello, baby!

28:47.792 --> 28:50.454
Yeah, this is
the Big Bopper speaking.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.290
Oh, you sweet thing.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.091
Do I what?

28:56.468 --> 28:58.459
Will I what?

28:58.670 --> 29:03.300
Oh, baby, you know what I like.

29:03.908 --> 29:08.174
Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a ponytail

29:08.379 --> 29:10.279
How are we supposed to follow that?

29:10.482 --> 29:12.279
Don't worry, Dewey, you'll do great.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.282
-Thanks, Buddy Holly.
-If you don't, I'll pick it back up.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.648
-You got nothing to worry about.
-Oh, thank you.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.057
I really like that "Walk Hard" song.

29:20.658 --> 29:22.091
Oh, thanks.

29:22.293 --> 29:25.490
I like that "Peggy Sue" song.
It's my favorite Buddy Holly song.

29:25.697 --> 29:28.131
Thanks, Dewey.
I'm awful proud of that one.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.358
Man, I'm awful nervous, Buddy Holly.

29:30.568 --> 29:33.833
Dewey, you'll be fine,
or my name's not Buddy Holly.

29:34.038 --> 29:37.337
Change of plans. Elvis wants
to get out of here early. He's hungry.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.511
We'll change the order.
After the Big Bopper, it's Buddy Holly...

29:40.712 --> 29:43.806
...then Elvis Presley,
and then you, Dewey Cox.

29:44.015 --> 29:47.109
So it's the Big Bopper...

29:47.318 --> 29:48.842
...and then Buddy Holly...

29:49.053 --> 29:52.489
...and then Elvis Presley,
and then me?

29:52.690 --> 29:55.022
Yeah. Just for tonight.

29:55.226 --> 29:58.684
Well, I'm just happy to be here.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.030
What am I doing?

30:04.235 --> 30:06.430
I ain't good enough to follow Elvis.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.106
What are you talking about, Dewey?

30:13.211 --> 30:15.839
Nate. Nate, is that you?

30:16.047 --> 30:18.982
You can do it, Dewey.
I know you can.

30:19.184 --> 30:22.676
I know because I'm your brother,
and I believe in you.

30:22.887 --> 30:25.185
But, hell, ain't nobody
can follow Elvis.

30:25.623 --> 30:28.615
-Wait, did you say Elvis?
-Yeah.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.625
Elvis Presley?
The King of Rock 'n' Roll?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.195
Yeah, Elvis Presley.

30:33.398 --> 30:35.423
He has nine number one hits.

30:35.633 --> 30:37.032
Nate, I understand that.

30:37.235 --> 30:39.066
He has 50 million fans.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.704
I'm aware of that, Nate.
That's why I'm out here.

30:41.906 --> 30:43.203
I'm having a crisis.

30:43.474 --> 30:45.066
Holy shit.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.772
Dewey! The big fella's on his
final encore. Are you ready?

30:51.249 --> 30:54.582
Yeah. I'm ready.

31:01.726 --> 31:03.660
Elvis!

31:05.630 --> 31:06.688
Ladies.

31:06.898 --> 31:09.765
Dang, Elvis Presley, you didn't
have to rile them up like that.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.595
What, now?

31:11.836 --> 31:13.667
-No, I'm--
-Excuse me, what?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.999
I'm just saying,
we gotta follow that and--

31:16.207 --> 31:19.005
Well, sometimes you have to go all out
when you're the King.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.440
Because there's only one man
who's the King.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.511
God picks him, hand-plucks him.

31:23.715 --> 31:27.412
One night, God looked down at all the
millions and millions of people, man...

31:27.619 --> 31:31.020
...and he decided which one
was the best, and it was me.

31:31.222 --> 31:34.988
He plucked me from all those millions
and millions of people, man.

31:35.326 --> 31:37.419
-Yeah.
-Listen to this, right now.

31:37.629 --> 31:41.121
There's two things you need to know.
I'm the King. And number two is:

31:41.332 --> 31:43.857
Look out, man! Look at that
coming at you. You see that?

31:44.068 --> 31:46.628
It's called karate
and only two kinds of people know it.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.965
The Chinese and the King.

31:49.173 --> 31:50.606
And one of them is me.

31:50.808 --> 31:51.832
You're the King.

31:52.043 --> 31:55.672
On to Memphis, they want a nice little
honey and a little bit of June bug.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.507
-Yeah?
-Yeah....

31:59.617 --> 32:01.141
Come on, man....

32:03.154 --> 32:04.644
Look out, man!

32:06.057 --> 32:07.251
Well, thanks, Elvis.

32:10.128 --> 32:12.562
Let's go. Come on, mama.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.858
What the fuck was he talking about?

32:18.403 --> 32:21.566
How y'all doing?
My name's Dewey Cox.

32:22.340 --> 32:27.573
And, well, looks like I got some
proving myself to do.

32:28.813 --> 32:30.178
Sam.

32:41.192 --> 32:42.523
Walk hard

32:43.895 --> 32:45.123
Hard

32:46.364 --> 32:49.765
Down life's rocky road

32:56.975 --> 32:58.875
Wow, great playing, boys.

32:59.077 --> 33:00.601
The fillies love you, Dewey.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.145
If I wasn't married with a good head on
my shoulders, I don't know what I'd do.

33:04.349 --> 33:06.909
You gotta get back out there.
They are going crazy.

33:07.118 --> 33:08.779
Let me splash some water
on my face.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.579
Okay. Hurry up!

33:12.357 --> 33:15.121
Golly, that rock 'n' roll.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.826
-Get out of here, Dewey.
-What are y'all doing in here?

33:22.033 --> 33:25.764
We're smoking reefer,
and you don't want no part of this shit.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.335
You're smoking reefers?

33:27.538 --> 33:29.301
Of course we are.
Can't you smell it?

33:29.841 --> 33:32.469
No, Sam, I can't.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.542
Come on, Dewey, join the party.

33:34.746 --> 33:38.477
No, Dewey, you don't want this.
Get out of here!

33:38.683 --> 33:41.345
I don't want no hangover.
I can't get no hangover.

33:41.552 --> 33:43.645
It doesn't give you a hangover.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.756
Will I get addicted to it
or something?

33:46.958 --> 33:48.653
It's not habit-forming.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.161
Oh, okay, well....

33:51.662 --> 33:55.120
I don't know.
I don't wanna overdose on it.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.527
You can't OD on it.

33:57.568 --> 33:59.502
It's not gonna make me
wanna have sex, is it?

33:59.704 --> 34:01.331
It makes sex even better.

34:02.106 --> 34:03.573
Sounds kind of expensive.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.834
It's the cheapest drug there is.

34:08.279 --> 34:09.405
You don't want it.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.871
I think I kind of want it.

34:12.617 --> 34:15.141
Okay, but just this once.
Come on in.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.815
-What do I do?
-Like this.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.665
Oh, my.

34:38.876 --> 34:43.040
Hey, listen, folks. I'd like to play
a song I wrote for a very special lady.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.306
I'm talking about Mrs. Dewey Cox.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.879
Oh, my darlin'

34:50.088 --> 34:52.056
Oh, my darlin'

34:52.255 --> 34:55.714
Yeah, yeah, yeah

34:55.960 --> 35:00.420
I have a perfect life

35:00.631 --> 35:04.795
You are the perfect wife

35:05.002 --> 35:08.961
I don't know why

35:09.173 --> 35:13.576
I sit and cry

35:14.045 --> 35:18.675
And now I miss you so

35:18.883 --> 35:23.081
Please don't let me go

35:23.287 --> 35:26.916
I make mistakes and that is true

35:27.525 --> 35:31.791
At least I learn each time I do

35:31.996 --> 35:32.985
Here, have some of this.

35:33.197 --> 35:35.529
Darling, you must believe

35:35.733 --> 35:41.467
I could never leave you
If I tried

35:42.140 --> 35:45.769
A life without you

35:45.977 --> 35:53.713
Is no life at all

35:56.287 --> 35:57.914
Oh, my darlin'

35:58.122 --> 35:59.953
Oh, my darlin'

36:00.158 --> 36:02.558
Yeah, yeah, yeah

36:02.760 --> 36:04.625
Beth Anne.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.296
Can I get that for you?

36:06.497 --> 36:07.964
Thanks, Dewey.

36:08.699 --> 36:12.760
Tears fall in vain

36:12.970 --> 36:17.236
I'm standing in the rain

36:17.441 --> 36:21.537
No matter how I feel

36:21.746 --> 36:26.581
I never seem to know what's real

36:26.784 --> 36:30.117
So sharpen up your knives

36:30.321 --> 36:33.313
-Can I get that for you?
-Thanks, Dewey.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.157
I'm a bad horse.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.956
Phil, can I get that for you?

36:44.368 --> 36:45.733
Thanks, Dewey.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.962
Darling, you must believe

36:48.172 --> 36:50.367
I could never leave you
If I tried

36:50.575 --> 36:53.908
Phil? What happened?

36:55.012 --> 36:58.072
A life without you

36:58.282 --> 37:06.587
Is no life at all

37:11.762 --> 37:13.730
Well, the tour's going
real great, baby.

37:13.931 --> 37:15.990
Yeah, we're having a real nice time.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.259
Yeah, the boys have been
playing great...

37:18.469 --> 37:21.029
...and the audiences have been
just wonderful, so....

37:21.239 --> 37:23.537
-When you coming home?
-Soon, baby, real soon.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.972
We gotta hit the major markets in
the Northeast, Chicago, Detroit--

37:27.178 --> 37:30.875
Dewey, could you shut up? I'm trying to
have sex with these women down here.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.606
Who's that?

37:32.950 --> 37:35.748
Oh, that's Sam.

37:35.953 --> 37:39.150
-He's just looking for his drumsticks.
-Howdy.

37:39.357 --> 37:40.949
Excuse me.

37:42.827 --> 37:47.093
Anyway, you don't wanna hear about
this boring stuff. How was your day?

37:47.298 --> 37:49.994
Oh, you know,
just taking care of the kids.

37:50.201 --> 37:53.568
Went down to Wilson's Market
the other day to pick up some milk.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.638
Completely out of milk.
I had to go down to Peach Street.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.537
-I hate going down there.
-Oh, brother. Can you believe it?

37:59.744 --> 38:00.768
-Yes, Bert?
-Hey, Dewey.

38:00.978 --> 38:03.208
-You want a cup of coffee?
-No, thank you.

38:03.414 --> 38:05.746
Will you give me a minute?
I'm on the phone here.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.877
-Who's that?
-That's Bert, my roadie.

38:08.085 --> 38:11.179
Just wants to know if I want any coffee
or anything like that.

38:12.423 --> 38:16.621
Dewey, there's a distance growing
between us, I feel, and I don't like it.

38:16.827 --> 38:18.920
Oh, now, that is crazy talk, Edith.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.654
You know
I'm just the same old Dewey.

38:20.865 --> 38:22.594
-Hey, Dewey.
-Yes, Bert?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.028
You seen my sandals?

38:24.635 --> 38:27.900
I don't know.
I'm talking to my wife, Bert.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.235
Baby, there's somebody at the door.
I gotta go.

38:31.442 --> 38:33.069
Can I call when I get to New Jersey?

38:33.277 --> 38:34.608
Okay. Bye, Dewey.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.143
-I love you.
-All right.

38:36.347 --> 38:37.541
-I love you.
-I love you.

38:37.748 --> 38:40.148
-You're never gonna make it, okay?
-Okay, bye.

38:40.685 --> 38:41.811
Bye.

38:46.023 --> 38:48.116
-Pa.
-Dewey.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.953
What are you doing here?

38:50.227 --> 38:51.455
It's about your mama.

38:52.797 --> 38:55.595
Ma? What about her? Is she okay?

38:58.302 --> 39:00.964
We better step out into the hall.

39:03.908 --> 39:07.207
-What happened?
-I'll tell you what happened.

39:07.445 --> 39:12.314
We were readying for bed
when your song comes on the radio.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.484
It's Dewey!

39:14.985 --> 39:17.977
Your son is talented.
You should be proud.

39:18.823 --> 39:23.226
Well, I must admit,
it is kind of catchy.

39:23.427 --> 39:24.758
Dance with me, Pa.

39:27.331 --> 39:29.822
It does make you kind of wanna move,
doesn't it?

39:30.034 --> 39:31.399
It sure does.

39:33.437 --> 39:36.338
Maybe I have been
kind of hard on little Dewey.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.401
Maybe you have.

39:43.447 --> 39:45.005
Be careful, Ma.

39:46.317 --> 39:48.751
-You all right, Ma?
-I'm all right.

39:53.524 --> 39:57.290
The vertigo, it won in the end.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.723
She lost her balance...

40:00.097 --> 40:02.292
...and fell out the window...

40:03.501 --> 40:05.401
...and then the radio
crushed her head?

40:05.603 --> 40:08.128
While she was dancing to your song.

40:08.773 --> 40:11.139
I thought you should know
what your music does.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.105
It kills people.

40:13.310 --> 40:16.507
You made her happy
and it killed her.

40:16.714 --> 40:20.878
If Nate was alive,
this never would have happened.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.351
Wrong kid died.

40:31.529 --> 40:34.259
Damn you, God!

40:36.600 --> 40:40.263
How could you let my mama
fall out a window?

40:41.272 --> 40:44.901
And then let a radio
hit her on the head?

40:49.180 --> 40:51.740
-Get out of here, Dewey.
-What are y'all doing in here?

40:52.116 --> 40:55.882
It's called cocaine,
and you don't want no part of this shit.

40:56.086 --> 40:57.917
Cocaine?

40:58.923 --> 40:59.890
What's it do?

41:00.090 --> 41:02.752
It turns all your bad feelings
into good feelings.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.152
It's a nightmare.

41:06.330 --> 41:09.561
I'm thinking maybe I'd like to try me
some of that cocaine.

41:11.502 --> 41:14.596
When I meet my maker
On my dying day

41:14.805 --> 41:17.467
Look him in the eye
And by God I'll say

41:18.142 --> 41:20.508
I gave my word
And my word was good

41:21.712 --> 41:25.705
I took it in the face
And I walked as hard as I could

41:25.916 --> 41:29.010
Walk hard
Walk hard, hard, hard

41:29.220 --> 41:31.017
Walk hard, hard, hard
Walk....

41:36.827 --> 41:39.159
All right, again. Faster.

41:39.363 --> 41:43.993
This is crazy, Dewey. Ain't nobody
gonna wanna listen to music like this.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.362
Standing there
playing as fast as you can...

41:46.570 --> 41:49.198
...singing like some sort of punk.

41:49.807 --> 41:52.640
Don't you dare try to stifle me.

41:52.843 --> 41:56.279
Whose band is this anyway,
you cocksucker!

41:56.714 --> 41:58.909
I'll punch you in the mouth!

42:00.317 --> 42:02.911
Oh, God. I'm sorry, Dave.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.678
No, I didn't mean that.

42:06.390 --> 42:11.191
Just with my mama dying and all,
I'm just all twisted up inside.

42:11.395 --> 42:12.623
Mr. Cox?

42:13.831 --> 42:18.325
I heard you were looking for a new
backup singer. For your new duet.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.061
You heard right.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.534
I was wondering if you might like
to give me a try.

42:26.944 --> 42:28.935
I reckon I might.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.213
I've been singing in my church choir
since I was a girl.

42:35.719 --> 42:36.879
I like the sound of that.

42:38.856 --> 42:40.551
Darlene Madison.

42:41.592 --> 42:43.389
Dewey Cox.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.458
Hello, Darlene.

42:48.766 --> 42:50.961
Hello, Mr. Cox.

42:52.036 --> 42:54.095
You ready to sing one?

42:54.305 --> 42:56.364
I'm always ready.

42:57.341 --> 42:59.070
Well, all right.

43:01.111 --> 43:04.080
In my dreams you're blowin' me

43:04.281 --> 43:05.771
Some kisses

43:08.252 --> 43:12.746
That's one of my favorite things
To do

43:14.592 --> 43:17.390
You and I could go down

43:17.595 --> 43:19.062
In history

43:21.599 --> 43:26.298
That's what I'm prayin' to do with you

43:26.837 --> 43:28.532
Let's duet

43:29.406 --> 43:33.069
In ways that make us feel good

43:33.644 --> 43:35.271
Let's duet

43:36.580 --> 43:39.606
And make that sacred sound

43:43.020 --> 43:45.488
Dewey Cox!
I am not that kind of woman.

43:47.558 --> 43:49.856
-All right.
-Well...

43:50.060 --> 43:52.722
...that doesn't mean
that we still can't be friends.

43:53.597 --> 43:55.189
Okay.

43:55.399 --> 43:57.924
Well, then, here's to us
being great friends.

44:02.506 --> 44:04.565
I can't! We're friends!

44:05.909 --> 44:08.036
I'm gonna beat off

44:08.278 --> 44:10.109
All my demons

44:12.216 --> 44:17.279
That's what lovin' Jesus' all about

44:18.889 --> 44:23.519
Lookin' in your eyes I start believin'

44:25.896 --> 44:30.765
Let's bring this whisper to a shout

44:31.235 --> 44:32.998
Let's duet

44:33.704 --> 44:37.504
In ways that make us feel good

44:38.375 --> 44:41.173
Put two and two together

44:41.378 --> 44:44.711
Perfect harmony we've found

44:44.948 --> 44:47.940
We know it's only natural

44:48.152 --> 44:50.677
Let's duet

44:52.022 --> 44:54.456
I just wanna make out

44:54.658 --> 44:56.353
What you're sayin'

44:58.562 --> 45:03.158
Read my lips
It's what you're lookin' for

45:05.369 --> 45:09.703
Here I am a-sneakin' up behind you

45:11.875 --> 45:17.472
You can always come in
My back door

45:17.681 --> 45:19.239
Let's duet

45:27.091 --> 45:31.619
Darlene, these last three weeks
have been so...

45:31.829 --> 45:34.059
...full and wonderful.

45:34.264 --> 45:37.461
We've shared so many activities
together as good friends.

45:37.668 --> 45:42.196
It's like you understand me
the way nobody else ever has.

45:42.639 --> 45:44.334
I mean, if I--

45:51.215 --> 45:54.651
-What is it, Dewey?
-I don't know.

45:55.319 --> 45:56.786
It's nothing. I'm fine.

45:56.987 --> 45:59.979
Nothing? You look like
you seen a ghost.

46:01.458 --> 46:04.291
I got a lot of pain in me, Darlene.

46:05.162 --> 46:06.424
You should know that.

46:06.797 --> 46:08.958
Where does all that pain
come from, Dewey?

46:10.434 --> 46:14.336
Did you ever have something
that you really loved...

46:15.405 --> 46:18.203
...that you accidentally...

46:19.843 --> 46:23.301
...killed, or hurt in some way,
with a machete?

46:23.514 --> 46:25.641
-No.
-No, me neither.

46:25.849 --> 46:28.283
-Wouldn't that be terrible?
-How would you live?

46:28.485 --> 46:31.420
I know, right? Exactly.

46:31.855 --> 46:34.050
Darling Darlene

46:35.459 --> 46:38.792
Darling Darlene

46:38.996 --> 46:42.090
I'm in love with you
I'm havin' fun with you

46:42.299 --> 46:45.393
I'm in love with you
I'm on the run with you

46:45.602 --> 46:50.733
I'm in love with you
And I'll be one with you one day

46:56.713 --> 46:58.977
Thanks for letting me sleep
in your bunk, Dewey.

46:59.183 --> 47:00.946
Gotta sleep somewhere, right?

47:04.054 --> 47:06.454
-Dewey, I can't.
-I know. I know.

47:07.090 --> 47:10.719
We both know that the sexual tension
between us is palpable.

47:11.094 --> 47:14.530
Don't you know that I wrestle with
the same temptations you do?

47:14.731 --> 47:17.165
I know I shouldn't be saying this
to you, Dewey...

47:17.367 --> 47:20.165
...because we're not married
and we're just friends...

47:20.370 --> 47:25.637
...but sometimes I lie awake at night
aching for a man's touch.

47:26.543 --> 47:29.808
And by "a man's touch,"
I mean a penis in my vagina.

47:31.048 --> 47:32.777
It's just so silly.

47:32.983 --> 47:35.042
Oh, that's so silly.

47:35.252 --> 47:38.221
-Well, we better get some sleep.
-Okay.

47:40.390 --> 47:42.517
Take my hand, Dewey.

47:43.060 --> 47:47.156
Let's promise to never, ever give in
to our lesser desires.

47:47.364 --> 47:50.162
After all, we're not married.

47:58.408 --> 48:00.569
I'm ready for sex.

48:09.052 --> 48:11.850
I been waiting for this for so long.

48:12.055 --> 48:13.249
Me too.

48:13.457 --> 48:15.721
From the moment I laid eyes on you.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.560
Oh, my.

48:33.877 --> 48:35.367
Dewey, I'm nervous.

48:35.579 --> 48:39.345
Don't worry, angel.
I'll show you the ways of love.

48:43.820 --> 48:45.685
Whoops-a-daisy.

48:47.424 --> 48:48.516
Oh, Dewey.

48:48.725 --> 48:50.716
Surprise!

48:51.028 --> 48:52.552
Edith!

48:53.096 --> 48:56.588
-Who are you?
-I'm his wife, that's who I am.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.030
No, you're not. I'm his--

49:00.270 --> 49:03.205
-Good Lord, you're already married?
-I can explain.

49:03.407 --> 49:07.468
Explain to her? You should explain
to me. I am the mother of your children.

49:07.678 --> 49:09.771
-It's not what it looks like.
-Children?

49:09.980 --> 49:11.413
It's not what it looks like.

49:11.615 --> 49:14.140
Not what it looks like to me,
or not what it looks like to her?

49:14.351 --> 49:17.115
It's gotta be the way it looks like
to at least one of us.

49:17.321 --> 49:18.413
We're married.

49:19.056 --> 49:21.581
I did the right thing.
It's not like we're not married.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.987
If you're married,
you can't get married again.

49:24.194 --> 49:27.425
I know, I know, and that was wrong,
but it's just....

49:28.198 --> 49:30.063
We were such good friends.

49:30.267 --> 49:33.259
You told me about that dream
where you were licking my balls...

49:33.470 --> 49:36.200
...and that seemed like a signal,
and....

49:36.473 --> 49:37.497
I forgot.

49:37.975 --> 49:41.968
I'm leaving you, Dewey Cox,
and I will see you in court!

49:42.179 --> 49:44.306
No, Edith! Don't go!

49:46.383 --> 49:49.011
Oh, well. She's gone now.

49:49.519 --> 49:54.252
I'm leaving too. You got the order
of things all backwards.

49:54.458 --> 49:56.289
Darlene, don't go!

49:56.493 --> 49:58.222
Edith, don't go either!

49:59.663 --> 50:03.861
I made a mistake.
I made a terrible mistake.

50:05.135 --> 50:07.899
Edith! Edith! Edith!

50:08.105 --> 50:10.699
-Leave me alone, Dewey.
-I never meant no harm to you.

50:10.907 --> 50:13.171
Edith. Cupcake.

50:13.377 --> 50:17.279
Baby, you don't know what it's like out
there on the road. It's lonely out there.

50:17.814 --> 50:19.338
Edith, I can't be alone.

50:19.549 --> 50:22.985
Maybe you should've thought of that
before you got double married.

50:23.453 --> 50:25.648
Is that what this is about?

50:25.856 --> 50:29.485
Don't you stand there and judge me
like I'm some kind of criminal.

50:29.693 --> 50:32.457
You are a criminal.
This is illegal, Dewey.

50:32.662 --> 50:33.856
What do you mean?

50:34.064 --> 50:37.591
It's illegal to be married to two people
at the same time, Dewey.

50:38.168 --> 50:41.103
What about if you're famous?
Is that--?

50:41.772 --> 50:43.865
You never done nothing
you shouldn't have done?

50:44.074 --> 50:45.302
What have I ever done?

50:45.509 --> 50:48.239
You woke up in the middle
of the night and drank the milk.

50:48.445 --> 50:50.709
I got up to have my cornflakes,
there's none left.

50:50.914 --> 50:52.381
Dewey, you cheated on me!

50:52.582 --> 50:55.210
So I'm a cheater,
but you can just drink up all the milk.

50:55.419 --> 50:58.786
Okay. All right, that's fine, I get it.
You're innocent, and I'm guilty.

50:58.989 --> 51:01.048
Guilty as charged.

51:01.558 --> 51:03.685
Guilty as charged

51:03.894 --> 51:06.192
Don't you dare write a song
right now, Dewey!

51:06.563 --> 51:10.431
You know what? Go ahead.
Take the children. I don't care.

51:11.001 --> 51:12.491
All I need is my music.

51:12.702 --> 51:13.964
I don't need you.

51:14.171 --> 51:15.866
And I don't need you.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.233
And I don't need you.

51:18.208 --> 51:19.766
And I don't need you.

51:19.976 --> 51:22.945
You're just sitting there
all high and mighty in your diaper.

51:23.146 --> 51:26.673
If anything, you need me.
You're a baby.

51:26.917 --> 51:27.906
Come on, Miles.

51:29.653 --> 51:31.177
Don't you dare take Miles.

51:31.388 --> 51:35.415
You can take the children,
but you leave me my monkey.

51:35.959 --> 51:37.426
Fine.

51:37.994 --> 51:40.224
Goodbye, Dewey Cox.

51:40.764 --> 51:42.425
No! No, come back.

51:42.999 --> 51:44.591
Don't leave me, Edith.

51:44.801 --> 51:48.703
"Don't leave me, Edith."
There's a title for a song.

51:51.641 --> 51:56.601
That's not a bad title,
but please don't leave me.

51:57.214 --> 51:58.408
What have you done?

52:05.889 --> 52:08.824
I'm telling you, I've had it.
I've had it with all this crap.

52:09.025 --> 52:10.322
You took her side every time.

52:10.527 --> 52:13.963
All you care about is fruit
and touching yourself. Well, fuck you.

52:15.565 --> 52:17.726
Get out of here.
You don't want no part of this.

52:17.934 --> 52:21.426
-What y'all doing in here?
-We doing pills, uppers and downers.

52:21.638 --> 52:23.401
They're the logical next step for you.

52:23.607 --> 52:25.268
I want some of that shit.

52:27.878 --> 52:31.143
Good morning, Your Honor.
May I approach the bench?

52:36.820 --> 52:39.618
I don't give a damn
What anyone thinks

52:42.425 --> 52:45.588
I stay up all night
And I smoke and I drink

52:47.464 --> 52:50.763
I'm a wanted man
And I'm blowin' town

52:50.967 --> 52:53.834
Don't waste your time
Tryin' to hunt me down

52:55.939 --> 53:00.569
The cops are sayin'
I belong behind bars

53:00.777 --> 53:02.677
And I'm guilty

53:02.879 --> 53:04.870
Guilty

53:05.515 --> 53:07.142
I'm guilty as charged

53:09.286 --> 53:11.117
Does Dewey seem unhappy to you?

53:13.056 --> 53:15.251
He's changed, I tell you,
he's changed.

53:15.458 --> 53:18.052
That was early Dewey,
this is middle Dewey.

53:19.329 --> 53:21.524
Dewey, are you enjoying yourself?

53:21.731 --> 53:25.531
What? Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot you were here.

53:25.735 --> 53:28.033
Hey, Dave. I like your girl better,
let's switch.

53:28.705 --> 53:32.038
-Well, Dewey, this is my wife.
-Oh, nice to meet you.

53:32.242 --> 53:34.335
Well, this is Kathy.
Kathy, this is Dave.

53:34.544 --> 53:37.206
Come on, darling.
So where you from?

53:39.883 --> 53:41.009
Hi there.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.049
Guilty

53:43.253 --> 53:45.915
I'm guilty as charged

53:47.557 --> 53:50.151
I ain't askin' God to forgive my sins

53:50.360 --> 53:53.022
Take a good look
And you'll know where I've been

53:53.230 --> 53:55.892
I'm dancin' with the devil
Every night and every day

53:56.233 --> 53:59.327
People pay attention to the things
That I say

53:59.536 --> 54:00.525
Say

54:00.904 --> 54:04.135
Hey, Jerry, I'm a long-time listener
and a first-time caller.

54:04.341 --> 54:07.833
Yeah, I just wanted to say
I love the show, keep it up.

54:08.044 --> 54:09.807
Am I on the radio right now?

54:10.313 --> 54:12.975
I'm guilty as charged

54:14.351 --> 54:18.845
If you're sayin' my love is too large

54:19.055 --> 54:20.113
Then I'm guilty

54:21.658 --> 54:25.389
Goddamn it,
this is a dark fucking period!

54:26.229 --> 54:27.696
Oh, I'm guilty

54:27.897 --> 54:30.957
-Freeze! Hands above your head.
-It's not what it looks like.

54:31.167 --> 54:33.294
I'm guilty as charged

54:33.503 --> 54:34.492
Stop!

54:35.138 --> 54:36.730
You got me.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.773
Come on, Mr. Cox. How about it?
Look here.

54:39.976 --> 54:47.610
I'm guilty as charged

54:56.259 --> 54:59.194
Cox, you got a visitor.

55:01.898 --> 55:03.957
Prison has changed me.

55:04.467 --> 55:07.493
I understand the common man
in a way I never did before.

55:08.772 --> 55:13.368
I gotta get out of here, so I can
bring joy to the men back in here.

55:13.576 --> 55:15.874
But I don't wanna live with them.

55:16.546 --> 55:17.808
Lean closer.

55:19.816 --> 55:22.148
I'm going to speak to you
in my language...

55:22.385 --> 55:26.014
...so that the guards can't understand
what I'm saying.

55:27.057 --> 55:29.082
There must be something you can do.

55:29.292 --> 55:31.590
I'm 21 years old.

55:31.795 --> 55:34.525
I got my whole life ahead of me....

55:34.731 --> 55:38.360
We think we can get you off.

55:38.902 --> 55:39.891
What do I have to do?

55:40.236 --> 55:42.932
You gotta go to rehab.

55:43.707 --> 55:45.368
-"Rehab"?
-Rehab.

55:48.244 --> 55:51.577
-Rehab?
-Oh, rehab. Okay, okay, I gotcha.

55:53.283 --> 55:55.911
Doctor! Doctor!

55:57.120 --> 55:59.384
-I'm so cold.
-We need more blankets.

55:59.589 --> 56:01.147
We need more blankets.

56:01.991 --> 56:03.515
Doctor!

56:03.727 --> 56:06.594
-I'm so hot!
-I think he has too many blankets.

56:06.796 --> 56:07.820
Fewer blankets!

56:08.598 --> 56:10.793
I'm hot and cold at the same time!

56:11.000 --> 56:13.867
He needs more blankets
and he needs less blankets.

56:14.070 --> 56:15.799
I'm afraid you're right.

56:16.005 --> 56:17.199
Dewey?

56:17.540 --> 56:19.667
My wife sends her love...

56:19.876 --> 56:21.104
...asshole.

56:21.311 --> 56:25.873
Dewey, tall and powerful

56:27.450 --> 56:30.749
Dewey, I don't know if you can
hear me in there...

56:32.622 --> 56:34.817
...but the wrong kid died.

56:36.559 --> 56:39.289
Dewey. Do you mind
if we get stoned in here?

56:39.496 --> 56:43.023
He can't hear you.
He's gonna die anyway.

57:01.518 --> 57:04.316
Are you ready to go home,
Dewey Cox?

57:05.922 --> 57:07.253
Darlene.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.888
I could never get you
out of my head.

57:12.862 --> 57:14.853
Me neither.

57:15.064 --> 57:17.294
I could never stop
thinking about you.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.264
But I wasn't gonna be
no home wrecker.

57:20.470 --> 57:24.907
Now that I'm your only wife though,
it seems different.

57:25.108 --> 57:29.977
I'm a new man, Darlene.
Prison and rehab have changed me.

57:30.346 --> 57:33.247
All these blankets
have saved my life.

57:33.483 --> 57:37.317
I think you're finally ready to be
the man I always thought you could be.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.987
Let me get this off.

58:26.002 --> 58:27.435
I love you.

58:27.637 --> 58:28.695
I love you too.

58:38.014 --> 58:41.916
Oh, my God.

58:49.993 --> 58:52.052
Oh, don't stop.

58:52.262 --> 58:55.629
Don't stop. Don't stop, Dewey.

58:55.832 --> 58:57.322
Oh, God.

58:59.202 --> 59:01.932
Oh, yes!

59:12.782 --> 59:14.682
Hey, boys, have you seen Dewey?

59:14.884 --> 59:17.409
I think I saw him in the barn
with Wavy Gravy

59:17.620 --> 59:19.485
I saw him by the creek
talking to Donovan.

59:19.689 --> 59:23.284
No, I think he was painting
a portrait with Joni Mitchell.

59:28.965 --> 59:30.933
Jerry Garcia, brother,
have you seen Dewey?

59:31.134 --> 59:33.500
I think I saw him in the study,
Sister Darlene.

59:33.703 --> 59:35.364
Thanks, Jerry Garcia.

59:36.439 --> 59:40.500
Hey! Casey, Jones,
watch your speed.

59:46.015 --> 59:49.178
Come on, Dewey. It's almost time
for Dewman's cake.

59:49.385 --> 59:53.913
All right. It's just-- It's hard for me
to sit around at some birthday party...

59:54.123 --> 59:57.149
...when I know there's so much
injustice going on in this world.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.453
-I know.
-My daddy was right.

59:59.662 --> 01:00:02.392
I can't spend all my time
thinking about Dewey Cox no more.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.430
I've got to think about
the other people.

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:05.925
Like your family?

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:11.367
No, I mean, like, people that's having
injustices done to them.

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:13.834
Like women and midgets and such.

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:17.535
I mean, it's 1 966, Darlene.
And, baby...

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.440
...I'm feeling it.

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:26.252
I know. The '60s are an important
and exciting time.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.755
Aren't they? It's like there's
something happening here.

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:33.588
And what it is ain't exactly...

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.253
...obvious.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.128
I have to try to help people
with my music.

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:43.396
Some people are saying that your new
music sounds a lot like Bob Dylan.

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:45.574
Well, maybe Bob Dylan
sounds a lot like me.

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.504
How come nobody
ever asks Bob Dylan:

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.610
"Why you sound
so much like Dewey Cox?"

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:55.307
Mailboxes drip like lampposts in
The twisted birth canal of the coliseum

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:01.423
Rimjob fairy teapots
Mask the temper tantrum

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.751
Oh, say can you see 'em?

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:08.763
Stuffed cabbage is the darling
Of the Laundromat

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:13.635
The mouse with the overbite explained
How the rabbits were ensnared

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:16.267
What the hell is this song about?

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:18.064
I have no idea.

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:22.574
You guys are idiots.
This song is very deep.

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:29.184
Inside the three-eyed monkey
Within inches of his toaster-oven life

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.785
What do your parents think about
your protest songs?

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:35.355
What do your parents think about
my protest songs, Mr. TlME Magazine?

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.361
All the elevator buttons

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:44.358
So incredibly high

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:47.559
I stand today for the midget

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:51.829
Half the size of a regular guy

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:56.370
Let me hold you, little man

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:59.571
As the parade passes by

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:03.579
Let me hold you, little man

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.412
We'll make believe you can fly

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.352
You shout for me to put you down

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:14.953
But I'm marching today
For your cause

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:18.998
I'm banging the drum
Your big day will come

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:21.796
When they remake The Wizard of Oz

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:28.537
So let me hold you, midget man

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:32.379
Pretend that you're flying in space

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:36.245
Let me hold you, midget man

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:39.250
So the dog will stop licking your face

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.750
Sing with me!

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:44.550
Sing it!

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.752
Mr. Cox, why are you going to India?

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:50.865
Well, I'm searching for something,
if you must know.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.535
I'm fixing to do some meditating
with the maharishi.

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:56.204
And Dewey Cox needs India
right now...

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:59.397
...and, heck, I reckon India
needs Dewey Cox too.

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:06.805
Only through meditation can we
begin to understand our role.

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:11.083
We're nothing but grains of sand.

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:13.687
That was freaking transcendental,
Paul McCartney.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.256
-Don't you agree, John Lennon?
-Yes, Dewey Cox.

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:19.822
With meditation there's no limit
to what we can...

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:21.394
...imagine.

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:23.394
What do you think, George Harrison?

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:27.296
I don't know. I'm just trying to get some
more songs on the album, you know.

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:30.768
And as Ringo Starr,
I'm not so interested in meditation.

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.032
I just like to have fun.

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:36.645
-I like the little one.
-It's so dark in this tent.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:40.304
Reminds me when we, the Beatles,
the four Beatles, us--

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:42.609
-From Liverpool.
-Yes, we are from Liverpool.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:46.778
We used to play those dark clubs
in Hamburg. Remember that, Paul?

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:51.289
Of course I do, I booked them.
I'm the leader of the Beatles.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.520
Well, I have to say I like your stuff.
It's pretty good.

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.994
And most of your records,
I really enjoy.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.100
We're big fans of your records too.

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:02.328
We like to think that Hard Day's Night
is our Guilty as Charged.

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.472
-Great record.
-Excellent album.

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.665
-We learned a lot from you.
-Great record.

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.503
-We're big fans of y'all.
-Huge fans.

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:11.305
You're almost as good as the Monkees.
You guys are great.

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:16.477
I think I might adjourn to another
dimension, take some LSD.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.086
-Do you care to join me?
-Yeah, let's do that.

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:21.756
Care to join us for some LSD?
It's good for you.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:25.325
-Built by scientists, it is.
-Lysergic.

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:27.589
Gotta check with headquarters.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.992
Come on, Dewey Cox.
Think you might enjoy it.

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:33.691
Open your mind to a new experience,
a new level of consciousness...

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:35.768
...Iike we do,
because we are the Beatles.

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:38.634
Let him decide.
If he wants to take LSD, he'll take it.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:41.036
He doesn't have to listen to you.
You're not the boss of him.

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:43.804
Don't tell me what to say
and what not to say, Paul McCartney.

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:48.347
I'm sick of you being so dark when I'm
so impish and whimsical. I'm sick of it.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:51.748
Hey, everyone,
I've got a brand-new mantra:

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.512
Paul's a big fat cunt.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.055
Don't know why you
don't let me write more songs.

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:59.660
You know, I just sit here while me
guitar quietly whimpers, you know.

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:02.456
You are the quiet one,
so why don't you shut the fuck up?

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:04.360
I've got a song about an octopus.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:07.502
Jam it up your ass. You're lucky
we still let you play drums.

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:11.469
Wow, seems like there's a rift
happening between the Beatles.

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:14.666
I wonder if your songs will
still be shit when I'm 64.

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.310
-Great sod.
-No, stop it!

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:17.843
You bastard! You sissy.

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:21.312
Beatles. Please stop fighting
here in India.

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:23.508
No, no, let them go.
Let them work it out.

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:24.708
Taste it.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.513
Right there in the bollocks.

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:29.251
-Bastard!
-Cunt!

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:32.890
Dewey, you been living clean
for three years now...

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.325
...and it's done you a world of good,
has it not?

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.624
I know I've had trouble
with drugs in the past.

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:42.395
But I'm addicted to coke, weed, booze,
ludes and speed. Not LSD.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.971
Nobody gets addicted to LSD.

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:48.007
It was invented by scientists.
Ringo Starr just told me.

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:51.008
I heard that doing LSD
can awaken your demons.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:55.139
I ain't got no demons
gonna get woke.

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:59.854
If you promise
it'll just be this one time.

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.482
Okay.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.426
Let's go drop acid with the Beatles.

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.097
Hello, Dewey.

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:21.037
Welcome to your LSD trip.

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:23.541
Where everything's a cartoon.

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:26.306
We're the trippy cartoon Beatles.

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:29.075
Look at that. It's a flying fish.

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.980
Totally trippy!

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.688
Wow, this LSD's all right.

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.983
I like being a trippy cartoon.

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:39.753
Just keep thinking
happy thoughts, Dewey.

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:43.090
I'd hate for this
to turn into a bad trip.

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:46.692
What's that scary music?

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:50.031
I had an unhappy thought.

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.672
It's a bad trip.

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.364
Bad trip, bad trip!

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:56.511
Help! Trippy machete!

01:06:57.613 --> 01:07:00.673
Oh, fuck me.
I can see my large colon.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.782
I guess I do have some demons.

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.476
You all right, Cox?

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:06.950
I don't know.

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:09.590
Do you want some more LSD?

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.625
Yeah. I think I do.

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:22.733
Mr. Schwartzberg, you're his long-time
manager. Maybe you can talk to him.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.633
Well, what's the problem?

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.400
He's been on that trampoline
for four days.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.636
You have got to talk some sense
into him. I'm worried.

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:36.613
Dewey, as your manager,
I have to tell you I'm concerned.

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.980
I think the LSD has changed you.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:42.749
It has changed me.
It's opened my mind right up.

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.425
I'm reinventing music.

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:47.687
I'm creating something new
that I call "shmusic."

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:51.389
You've recorded the same song for
months. You're not close to finished.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.228
Because this record is different
than any other I've made.

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.871
I told you. This is going to be
my masterpiece.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.303
The one I'm remembered by.
It's for my brother.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:00.633
What brother?

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.311
Nothing. Never mind. It's private.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:06.276
I've got this sound in my head
and it's trying to get out.

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:10.043
I can't find it on this human plane of
existence. I've got to keep searching.

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:14.850
But I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna find it.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.594
You guys should make friends.
He's a wonderful man.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:29.259
Professor, good morning.
All right, everyone. Thank you.

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.831
I've just been outside,
I had a little bounce.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:35.033
What we're going to do is
run through the entire piece...

01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:37.144
...in our minds, silently.

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:39.314
And...

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:40.845
...begin.

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:43.712
As we sit here together
on Thanksgiving...

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.682
...on our beautiful trampoline...

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:50.018
...I think we should take a moment to
think about what it's like to be a turkey.

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:53.057
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:55.093
"Hi, I'm just a little turkey."

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.822
Just cut the damn bird, boy.

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:02.335
Dewey? Can we just enjoy
our Thanksgiving dinner?

01:09:02.537 --> 01:09:07.134
You think you're so great
sitting there all drugged up...

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.140
...on your trampoline.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.540
You're the black sheep
of this family.

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:13.745
You call yourself a Cox.

01:09:13.948 --> 01:09:15.849
Until you get right with Jesus...

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:20.010
...you'll never be nothing
but a big, black Cox.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:25.719
Nothing I do will ever please you,
will it?

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:30.095
We're both Cox, Pa.
Both of us are Cox.

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:33.700
I've got 1 37 musicians
waiting on me.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.894
You'll have to excuse me.

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:37.935
Dewey, watch the turkey.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:46.703
I wasn't dreaming

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.542
Barely awake

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:52.584
Off to the grinder we stroll

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.288
This is not a good song.

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:58.989
It's like five songs on top
of each other at the same time.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.925
Not even a song.
It's some kind of concerto.

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:03.392
Just let him work it out.

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:06.128
Masterpieces take time.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.361
Do you hear that?
That goat's been singing...

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:11.972
...more than I am on this damn song.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:18.672
Well?

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.679
That was beautiful, Dewey.
It was perfection.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:24.478
Yeah, even the goat was perfect.

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:27.212
Yeah, the goat was good.
Were the strings tangy enough?

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.414
Oh, they were tangy.
They were very tangy.

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.320
Unbelievably tangy.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:34.496
No, guys, the strings were not tangy!
They were salty!

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:36.221
Am I crazy?

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.957
Let's do one more time.
Okay, strings, lean into it.

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:42.001
I want it really tangy this time.
Now, Mike, you're flatting.

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:46.197
Bushmen, make it sound like
you're in the fucking bush, okay?

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.501
Back off the goat
on the second pre-chorus.

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.474
I wanna hear his heart, not his soul.

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:53.546
Sam, go back to that thing you did
yesterday on the bridge.

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:57.014
-What did I do?
-It sounded like velvet pancakes.

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:59.881
-Yeah, right.
-Okay, everybody, one more time.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.353
What on earth is a velvet pancake?

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:07.325
It's the LSD.
I think it's having an effect on him.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:10.396
From the top of the overture.
Slate it.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:13.860
"Black Sheep," take 1 1 2.

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:17.163
One, and a two,
and a five, six, seven, eight.

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:22.809
I just close my eyes
When I fantasize

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:26.243
Much to my surprise
I'm only half the size

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.313
That I used to be

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:33.517
Bye-bye, white brother

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:37.317
This black sheep gotta roll

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:39.653
It's on the beat!

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.897
I just open up
Like a catacomb

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:46.932
Though my heart is half
From the half-F tone

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.636
That tickles.

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:55.033
Bye-bye, pastures of plenty

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:58.842
I don't know where I will

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.676
-Roam
-Black sheep, black sheep

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.412
Like that, with some urgency.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:08.056
Not, "I'm in the yard.
I wanna go outside."

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:12.694
Like, "I'm about to die." Like that.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.624
The blade has been swung

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:17.594
Black sheep, black sheep

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.635
All right? Here we go.

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:25.297
Push. Push, baby, push.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.275
-Are we recording this?
-No.

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:30.741
Well, we should be. Get a microphone.
Push, baby.

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.311
Push.

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.607
Push! Push!

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:39.785
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:43.287
I'm losin' no sleep
I'm dyin'

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:47.655
Why shouldn't I keep from cryin'?

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.523
Cryin'

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:54.032
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:57.569
I'm losin' no sleep
I'm dyin'

01:12:57.773 --> 01:13:01.072
Why shouldn't I keep from cry--?

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.406
It's still not finished yet.

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:12.611
I'm hearing more
aboriginal percussionists.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:17.454
And I want an army of didgeridoos.
Fifty thousand didgeridoos!

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.718
Folks, can we have a moment
with Dewey?

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:25.026
What the hell are these songs about?

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.532
You're singing about
cutting people in half--

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:32.631
I'm working something out.
It's called a metaphor.

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:34.274
Well, what are you working out?

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:36.774
It's secret.
That's why it's called metaphor.

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.708
That's what metaphor means. Secret.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:42.012
I just don't see why you gotta
throw away the recipe, is all.

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:46.313
Why don't we just go in there, lay down
some tracks like we always done?

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:49.082
Yeah, why can't we just walk hard?

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:51.122
What do we need
all these people for?

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:54.921
I don't need people around me
stifling me.

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:58.463
So if you don't like it,
there's the door.

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:01.191
Dewey?

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.098
Are you saying
you don't need us no more?

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:10.040
Not unless you can open your mind
and learn to play the fucking theremin.

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:13.976
Fuck you, Dewey!

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.780
Yeah, fuck you, Dewey.

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:19.545
In 20 years not once have you
thrown a woman my way.

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:22.087
You don't think we like
cheating on our wives too?

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.283
And you never once paid for drugs.
Not once!

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:28.463
You pay that chimp
more than you pay us.

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:31.497
I had to borrow from the chimp
to get a mortgage on my house.

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.898
And those stupid Siamese glass cats
you get us every year for Christmas.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:38.937
I don't want any more
Siamese glass cats!

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:42.133
The Siamese cat is a symbol of nobility
in ancient Egypt.

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:43.333
Fuck nobility!

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:45.410
Fuck ancient Egypt.

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.313
Fuck cats!

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.984
And you never paid for drugs.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.650
Not once.

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:53.481
You slept with my wife.

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:54.883
You slept with me too!

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:58.321
And I've had confused feelings
about that for 1 0 years now!

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.927
And you never once paid for drugs.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.298
Not once.

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.626
You're on your own, Dewey Cox.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.360
We're leaving.

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:14.067
Well, I guess this is the end of
a chapter in your life, Dewey Cox.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:30.382
What's happened to you,
Dewey Cox?

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:31.923
Stay out of this, Darlene!

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:34.595
You're driving away the people
who love you most!

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:36.821
I don't need anybody, Darlene.

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.099
All I need is my music.

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:44.396
This ain't about your music, Dewey.
It's about the drugs.

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:47.336
Honey, I told you
I'm gonna quit again.

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.836
As soon as the record's done.
Whenever that is.

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.740
Look, you can't rush a masterpiece.

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:58.514
You need to take a break. You need
to clean yourself up, otherwise--

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.914
Otherwise what?

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:02.590
Otherwise I can't be married
to you no more.

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.521
I know you don't mean that.

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:08.220
I believe you know that I do.

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.730
Okay.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.639
-Okay?
-Okay.

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:20.768
You'll take a break?

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:23.074
I will take a break.

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:24.911
And you'll quit the drugs?

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.679
And I will quit the drugs.

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:29.978
Dewey!

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:35.356
Oh, baby. I've been praying
about this day for so long.

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:38.357
-What did you just put in your mouth?
-Gum.

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:42.292
-You ain't chewing no gum.
-Candy?

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:45.398
-What did you put in your mouth?
-It's PCP.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.796
Oh, you just said--!

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:53.069
I'm going to town!

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:01.115
Get out of the road, you jerk!

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.074
Hey!

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:05.744
Hey! What's going on?

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:17.665
There he is!

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:27.098
Dewey! Get off that building!
It's inappropriate!

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:33.878
Dewey Cox, you give me no choice.

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:38.951
It breaks my heart,
but I'm leaving you.

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.416
I'm Zeus!

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:45.950
No mortal can stop me! I'm Zeus!

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.097
-Rehab?
-Rehab.

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:03.166
Nate!

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.807
Nate?

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.178
This is what I'd look like
if I'd grown up...

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:14.085
...and perhaps hadn't been murdered,
or whatever.

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:18.081
I just came to tell you
you need to get your shit together!

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.783
I know.

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:21.462
I've fallen again.

01:18:21.663 --> 01:18:23.961
Listen to yourself.
Whining like a little bitch.

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:27.863
If I was alive right now, I'd be the
fucking president of the United States.

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:31.164
I'd be on the moon, walking around
looking for aliens to kill.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.035
-What?
-You know why Dad liked me better?

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.039
Because I was better than you.

01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:38.542
When I played the piano,
I was fucking awesome.

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:40.715
Well, you think
it's been easy for me?

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:42.907
Since you're gone
I got no sense of smell.

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.779
Oh, you got no sense of smell?

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:49.123
You can't smell anything?
You can't smell anything?

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:51.758
I got no sense of having legs,
Dewey!

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.191
I have no life!
I'm dead because somebody...

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.422
...I'm not gonna point out
names right now...

01:18:57.632 --> 01:18:59.497
...decided to murder me
with a machete.

01:18:59.701 --> 01:19:02.431
-Nate.
-I can't even smell, touch, feel.

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:06.539
I can't even masturbate. You ever try
to jerk off with a ghost hand? Nothing!

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:11.211
I'm just trying to say
you need to fix this shit.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:14.678
You need to get out of that bathtub.
Start writing songs again.

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.120
Is he almost done
thinking about his life?

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:25.020
He just reached the '70s.

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:46.940
Schwartzy, I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know what's going on with me.

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:48.411
I got the song block.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:49.641
Song block.

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.842
I don't need to write any new songs.

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:55.489
I'll just do my old ones. We'll do
a oldies tour. I'll do "Walk Hard."

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:58.523
Dewey, "Walk Hard"
is over 20 years old.

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:01.025
Well, a lot of people like
my old songs.

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:03.060
Old people like your old songs.

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:04.824
May I make a suggestion?

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:07.058
Are you familiar with
the Donny & Marie show?

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:10.466
-The television show?
-I got a call from CBS.

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:13.266
They wanna do the same kind
of show with you.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.933
I'm a serious musician.
I'm not some TV personality.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:20.546
Well, why can't you be both? Look
at those goofy bastards on Hee Haw.

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:22.448
Well, I do love Hee Haw.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.779
Television, Dewey. It's the way
into the people's hearts.

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:29.447
All right. You call them back today...

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:32.024
...and you tell Mr. CBS...

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:35.788
...that I will do it if I have
total creative control.

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:38.557
Dewey, you can't have
any creative control.

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:41.565
Okay.

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:44.739
All right, let's just do it then.
Fuck it, let's do it.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.268
I'm bored.

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:50.202
Live from Burbank, California.

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:52.346
It's The Dewey Cox Show.

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:57.610
And now your host, Dewey Cox!

01:20:57.819 --> 01:20:59.912
-Walk hard
-Hard

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.645
-Hard
-Hard

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:04.951
Down life's rocky road

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:07.720
-Walk bold
-Bold

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.294
-Hard
-Hard

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:11.465
That's my creed

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.497
My code

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:15.761
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.636
Had to suffer every day
My whole life through

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.641
Seen my share of the worst
That the world can give

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.772
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:31.516
Walk hard

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:34.244
Walk hard

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:38.659
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the show.

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.088
We've got a great one.

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:43.093
To get things rolling,
I'd like to bring out my first guest...

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:47.701
...a model I think is pretty super:
Miss Cheryl Tiegs.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.041
Well, hello, Cheryl.
Don't you look lovely tonight.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.267
Well, thanks so much, sir.
So do you.

01:21:56.478 --> 01:22:00.710
Cheryl, you know, you remind me
of a 1 977 Corvette.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.042
Why is that?

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.115
Because you're
a beautiful new model.

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:09.050
Just kidding.

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:16.527
Would you do me the honor
of joining me for a song?

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:19.359
Well, I thought you'd never ask,
Mr. Cox.

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:25.837
Baby, come as you are
With just your heart

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:29.072
And I'll take you in

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:32.136
You're rejected and hurt

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:37.512
To me you're worth
What you have within

01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:41.454
You don't have to be a star, baby

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:44.825
To be in my show

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:48.959
Good night, everybody.
We'll see you next week.

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:55.792
Good show.

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.600
-You ready, Dewey?
-Yes, I'm ready.

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:06.804
"Who Wants to Party?"
Dewey, lead vocal, take one.

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:13.918
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:17.990
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:22.562
Hey, hey
Who wants to party now?

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:27.028
I don't know. I'll see you in a minute.

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:30.227
All right. Everybody good?
Everybody good?

01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:32.269
Whoa, Dewey.
Great party, great party.

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:35.773
Thanks, Patrick Duffy from Dallas.
Listen, mingle, enjoy yourself.

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:38.878
-Have sex with anybody you want.
-Well, can do.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.479
-Hey!
-Dewey!

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:44.709
Oh, my God, your show is such a hit.
You beat McCloud last week.

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:48.514
Well, thank you, Morgan Fairchild,
but I never pay attention to the ratings.

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:51.385
Just kidding. We're gonna
take a shit on Donnie & Marie.

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.151
-Oh, you do that, honey.
-Yes.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:57.127
Hey, you. Are you gonna
save a dance for me, Dewey?

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:59.800
Well, you bet,
Cheryl Ladd from Charlie's Angels.

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.935
Hey there, Little Miss Cox-Tiegs.

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:04.105
Have you met my new wife,
Cheryl Cox-Tiegs?

01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:06.296
We've met, yes.

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:08.703
Isn't that funny?
You're both named Cheryl.

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:11.140
Yeah. We're aware of that.

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:13.938
That is hilarious.

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:17.616
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:20.117
I don't know what they're
talking about with this energy crisis.

01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:23.586
Because I have plenty of energy,
all right? I am loaded with energy.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.185
Look, I gave up politics
a long time ago.

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:31.832
You know, let somebody else march.
I wanna play Frisbee.

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:35.427
I'm on the beach.
I'm not marching on the beach.

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:37.969
Billy, don't be a hero

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:41.142
Don't be a fool with your life

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:46.313
Do me, Dewey.

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:53.946
I can't, Cheryl Ladd,
I'm married to Cheryl Tiegs.

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:57.215
Oh, I should've been your guest star
last week instead of her.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:59.791
It could've been me.

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:02.491
"It could've been me."

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:06.428
It could have been me
Could've been me

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.226
Stay in it. Stay in it.

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:16.103
It could've been me

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.710
Rocky ro--

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:23.179
No! You're repeating yourself!

01:25:24.385 --> 01:25:27.843
Why can't I write
a fucking song anymore?

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:31.556
I love the nightlife
I got to boogie

01:25:31.759 --> 01:25:34.557
On the disco 'round

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:35.990
Oh, yeah

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:39.030
I told you
I love the nightlife

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:40.496
I got to boogie

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:44.194
On the disco 'round
Oh, yeah

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:47.772
I'll tell you, I've never been
so truly satisfied.

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:50.945
Living here in this beautiful
beach house with you...

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:53.637
...my beautiful Cheryl Cox-Tiegs.

01:25:53.848 --> 01:25:56.976
The ratings are great.
These are the salad days.

01:25:57.185 --> 01:26:01.781
Yeah, I've been looking for something
my whole life, and this is it.

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:04.888
I'm finally truly satisfied.

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:14.061
Goodbye, love

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:18.294
Goodbye, love

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:22.340
You are not going home.
You are sleeping in the guestroom.

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:24.239
Forever.

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:26.470
Because you're the only one
who stuck around.

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.672
Everyone else got sick of it
and left...

01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:31.579
...but you stuck around,
which means you're my friend.

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:41.327
There's a starman waiting in the sky

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.258
He'd like to come and meet us

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:45.125
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:49.497
There's a starman waiting in the sky

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:53.196
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:54.602
He told me

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:58.108
Let the children use it
Let the children lose it

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.474
Let all the children boogie

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:02.978
Goddamn it!

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:07.144
I mean, what do I have to do
to get you on my bone? Invent fire?

01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:10.882
And then huge laugh and we go
to commercial. All right, take five.

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:12.953
Hey.

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:15.553
Great rehearsal, Dewey.
Very funny sketch.

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.856
Thank you.
Have you seen the ratings?

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.660
We're getting our ass kicked
by The Incredible Hulk.

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:23.860
Well, last night's episode
was a very special episode.

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.973
They revealed that the Incredible Hulk
has an evil twin.

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:28.836
And he's not green. He's red.

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:31.136
I know. It was amazing.
Did you see it?

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:34.338
You can't compete with that.
But we do need to do more promotion.

01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:38.212
Here's what we'll do. We'll introduce
people to the new Dewey Cox.

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:42.321
I got a girl here to interview you.
She's from the local affiliate in Dallas.

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:46.523
I don't know.
I'm not so good on interviews.

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:48.992
Bubbe, it's a puff piece.
It's very puffy.

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:51.165
All you have to do
is remind the audience...

01:27:51.366 --> 01:27:55.200
...you're not mainlining acid anymore.
And the show, it's a lot of fun, right?

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:56.563
-You're having fun.
-Yeah.

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:59.239
It's on every Thursday night
after the local news.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.308
"It's on every Thursday night after your
local news. I'm not mainlining acid."

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:05.638
-Anymore.
-Oh, I'm not gonna promise that.

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:09.044
-Whatever you're comfortable with.
-"I don't smoke angel dust anymore.

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:11.275
So don't be afraid."
Something like that?

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:13.886
Why don't you tell us about
your new TV program?

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:16.852
Gail, it's a variety show.
I do a little bit of everything.

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:19.822
I do some singing, some dancing,
chatting with the guests...

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:22.121
...the skits, the monologues,
the comedy.

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:23.888
Wonderful. Comedy.

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:26.498
It really is a lot of fun.

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:30.569
We'll have more fun when we come
back from this word from our sponsors.

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:32.103
Don't go away.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:37.839
Okay, you know what, I gotta tell you,
my heart goes out to you.

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:41.413
I know what it's like to be on
a piece-of-shit television program...

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:44.585
-...because I'm hosting one right now.
-Excuse me?

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:47.880
Must wanna blow your fucking
brains out, I'll bet. I know I do.

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:51.214
And we're back
with Mr. Dewey Cox.

01:28:51.426 --> 01:28:53.917
We're talking about the fun
he's having on his show.

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:58.360
But right now, let's talk about your
lovely wife, Darlene. How's she doing?

01:28:58.766 --> 01:29:01.030
Darlene and I separated
some years ago, Gail.

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:03.567
Oh, okay. Guess I didn't
do my homework.

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:06.035
And to answer your question,
I miss her terribly.

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.502
Well, that's sweet.

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:10.872
Why don't we talk about your parents?
They've gotta be proud of you.

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:13.403
Well, my mom is dead.

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:18.449
And my pa and I don't
speak to each other...

01:29:18.653 --> 01:29:20.780
...so we're not very close.

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:25.216
We can always cut around this
if it gets too pathetic.

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:28.554
Tell us about your kids.
I know you got a whole slew of them.

01:29:28.996 --> 01:29:31.487
I'm locked in a custody battle
at this time.

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:34.600
Custody is being forced upon me,
which I don't think is right.

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:37.794
You know, if you don't want
the responsibility of children...

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:39.973
...you should be able to walk away...

01:29:40.174 --> 01:29:44.406
...and apparently a couple of my
ex-wives don't feel the same. So, yeah.

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:47.080
Wherever my kids are, they're watching
The Dewey Cox Show...

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:50.114
...on Thursday nights at 8:00,
right after the local news.

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:52.781
And I just wanted to say
to everyone out there...

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:55.785
...I'm no longer mainlining acid
or smoking PCP.

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.480
It's official.

01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:01.653
Okay. Why don't we lighten it up
just a bit here?

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:05.959
You're so busy, Dewey Cox, do you
have time to stop and smell the roses?

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.461
I've got no fucking sense of smell.

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:09.959
All right, I'm done.

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:14.369
-Come on, folks. Do a little research.
-That would've been nice information.

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:18.577
I'm sorry, I must be tired
from the show or something.

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.476
-It's okay.
-Yeah, Dewey, it's okay.

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:24.480
No, it's not okay.
I should be able to do this.

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:26.516
We're in no rush.

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:29.248
Should we get an
American Indian woman?

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:33.257
No, that won't help. I mean,
it should already be pretty exciting.

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:35.520
There's three of you.

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.558
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:42.664
Yeah.

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.667
-Dewey.
-Nate?

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:50.332
You were supposed to be double great.
What the fuck is this bullshit?

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:52.638
-I know.
-All I'm asking...

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.712
...is that you write one
masterpiece...

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:57.441
...that is the culmination
of your entire life.

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:58.641
How hard is that?

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:02.453
I'm empty, Nate. What do I do?

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:07.390
Dewey, who's the one person in your
life who's made you feel like shit?

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:09.961
-Pa.
-You need to talk to him, Dewey.

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:13.198
-I don't know.
-You need to hug him.

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:17.736
I have been putting this off
my entire life...

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:20.600
...but I think you might be right.

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:25.411
The wrong kid died

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:29.215
Hello, Pa.

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:34.552
What do you want?

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:37.189
I feel like there's some things
I need to say to you.

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:39.858
Well, go on. Talk.

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:42.720
I've realized that...

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:47.224
...I never really said I was sorry
for what happened with Nate.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:51.070
Pa, I've spent my entire life...

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:54.605
...trying to find love with wives...

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:56.640
...and hotel clerks...

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:58.903
...and tollbooth attendants...

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:02.241
...and giraffes and monkeys
and trampolines...

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:05.510
...and men who dress like women
and men who look like you.

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:11.251
And I realized the only person
I've ever really wanted to love me...

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.394
...was you, Pa.

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:18.898
Dewey, I don't know what to say.

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.728
You don't have to say anything, Pa.

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:25.394
I just wanted to come here
and tell you that I loved you...

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.370
...and I always have.

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:35.244
I appreciate you finding the courage
to say that, Dewey.

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:38.618
But there's only one way
to settle this.

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:42.616
-Machetes.
-What?

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:45.553
The right kid is gonna die tonight.

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:50.863
You've been practicing!

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:08.347
No, Pa. No!

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:11.450
I been waiting for this
for a long time!

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.313
You have?

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.059
Oh, no.

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:23.492
Oh, my goodness!

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:25.325
I halved myself.

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:28.024
Pa! No, Pa!

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:32.763
Dewey, I guess I never realized
until this moment...

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:38.276
...just how easy it is to accidentally
cut someone in half.

01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:39.468
It is, right?

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.944
I'm sorry for blaming you, Dewey.

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:45.209
Of course you didn't mean
to cut Nate in half.

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:47.546
It's all so obvious now.

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:48.949
Pa.

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:51.681
I should've been a better father
to you, Dewey.

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:55.487
I wish I spent more time
playing catch with you...

01:33:55.696 --> 01:34:00.429
...and less time training my body
and mind to kill you in a machete fight.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:03.900
You be a better father
than I was, Dewey.

01:34:04.105 --> 01:34:05.367
I'll try, Pa.

01:34:05.573 --> 01:34:07.200
It shouldn't be that hard.

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.602
In case I don't make it--

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:12.301
Pa! You're gonna make it!
It's the 1 970s!

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:16.108
They got all kinds of new procedures
that can attach tops to bottoms now!

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:18.547
Hang in there! You're gonna be fine!

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:22.450
I reckon you're probably right.
Now, go call the doctor...

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:25.285
-...and bring me some ice, a lot of ice.
-Some ice.

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.586
And a tourniquet.
Don't forget a tourniquet.

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:30.457
-All right, ice and a tourniquet?
-Ice and a tourniquet.

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:33.065
-And a tourniquet.
-Don't forget that tourniquet.

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:36.566
And you know those three words
you always wanted to hear, Dewey?

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:38.204
Well, here they are.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:39.973
I love....

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:44.102
You love what?

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:46.537
Pa, you love what?

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:48.974
What was the third word?

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:50.616
Come on, one more word!

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:52.979
No!

01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:58.217
I want all you fucking parasites
out of my house...

01:34:58.426 --> 01:34:59.757
...right now!

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.690
I said, everybody out!

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:06.097
Well, look at you,
you arrogant cocksucker.

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.235
-How dare you.
-What happened to you, Dewey?

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:13.032
I don't know what's happened to me,
but I know what happened to you.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.003
Patrick Duffy took a beating.

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:19.904
Stop it, Dewey, you son of a bitch.

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:25.885
Stop it! Patrick Duffy was only
saying what we were all feeling.

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:29.147
You get the hell away from me,
Cheryl Cox-Tiegs!

01:35:32.993 --> 01:35:35.860
If you tear that sink off the wall,
I'm leaving you.

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:37.257
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.768
I'm leaving you, Dewey Cox.

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:44.704
No!

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:33.481
Dad?

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:38.948
Yes, what is it, son?

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.958
I was just wondering
if you wanna have a catch.

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:45.224
A catch?

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:49.096
Son...

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:54.006
...there is nothing in this world
I want more...

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:56.904
...than to have a catch with you.

01:36:58.245 --> 01:37:02.648
Son, forgive me,
this is going to sound strange...

01:37:03.684 --> 01:37:05.618
...but what is your name again?

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.948
I'm Dewey Junior,
but my friends call me "Dewdrop."

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:11.057
Well....

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:18.587
It's nice to formally meet you,
Dewdrop.

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:21.391
So this is catch.

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:25.230
This is what I been missing out
on all them years on the road, huh?

01:37:26.073 --> 01:37:29.839
I like it, it's wonderful. You throw
it to me, I throw it back to you.

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:33.309
It's so simple, and yet so powerful.

01:37:34.448 --> 01:37:36.507
Boy, you're really terrible
at this game.

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:39.345
Well, I mean, you never really
played with me before.

01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:42.954
How am I supposed to learn?
A boy needs a dad.

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:45.220
Yes, he does.

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:49.622
Well, I reckon we got some lost time
to make up, you and me.

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:52.594
And all your brothers and sisters.
How many of you are there?

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:56.930
Twenty-two brothers and sisters. And
also 1 4 half-brothers and half-sisters.

01:37:57.137 --> 01:37:59.002
Holy shit.

01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:00.767
This may take a while.

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:05.673
That's real good.

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:10.039
So beautiful.

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:17.582
Are you sure you're one of mine?

01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:44.116
Go ahead and taste some dirt.

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:45.910
That's good dirt. That's good dirt.

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.055
On the surface,
Macbeth is about revenge.

01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:50.416
But what is the subtext?

01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:53.752
A power struggle for the Scottish
royal family, that's what it is.

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:55.826
I just gave you it.
That one's a mulligan.

01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:03.602
Yeah.

01:39:17.017 --> 01:39:18.006
Hello, Dewey.

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:20.610
Darlene.

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:25.383
It's Dewina's birthday. I brought her
a present. It's a bracelet.

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:28.060
How's Glen Campbell?

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:29.991
He and I split up a long time ago.

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:31.924
Really?

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:34.199
It's just me these days.

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:35.766
At age 50.

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:39.662
Would you care to take a walk
with me, Darlene Madison?

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.299
I haven't been playing much music.

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:49.448
I realize now I wasn't much of a father
when I was out on the road.

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:51.876
Now this is what makes me happy.

01:39:52.086 --> 01:39:55.886
Not the music, not getting high...

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:57.921
...just my family.

01:39:58.125 --> 01:39:59.558
That's all I care about.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:02.456
And that family is missing one piece,
Darlene.

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:06.424
My God, you're as beautiful
as the day I met you.

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:14.501
You don't want this dirty old Cox.

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:16.471
Oh, I want it more than ever.

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:22.080
Did you wash your hair today?

01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:24.978
I sure did. How could you tell?

01:40:25.185 --> 01:40:27.551
It smells terrific.

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:36.923
I smelt it.

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:39.131
You mean...?

01:40:40.467 --> 01:40:42.264
I smelt it!

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:45.094
I can smell again!

01:40:47.775 --> 01:40:49.208
I smelt it!

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:51.810
-I smell you.
-Smell it.

01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:54.042
Oh, you've been driving me wild.

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:57.113
I smelt it! I smelt it!

01:40:57.317 --> 01:40:59.217
I smelt it, God!

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.854
It's a miracle!

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:03.921
I smell you, flowers.

01:41:04.124 --> 01:41:05.421
I smell you, twig.

01:41:07.628 --> 01:41:09.118
I smell horseshit!

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:14.566
It's horrible!

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:17.202
-But I can smell it!
-Smell that shit, baby!

01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:19.099
I smelt it.

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:27.105
Anyway, that's when I learned...

01:41:27.314 --> 01:41:31.011
...that Quaaludes and water-skiing
do not mix.

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:32.685
Now, you remember that.

01:41:32.886 --> 01:41:35.286
How come you did all of that stuff,
Grandpa?

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:40.586
Well, Dewey Rahim, I'll tell you.
I was young and stupid then.

01:41:40.794 --> 01:41:42.955
I didn't understand a lot of things.

01:41:43.163 --> 01:41:46.326
Think it had to do with how
I was reared as a boy.

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:49.327
But, you know, I got no complaints.

01:41:49.536 --> 01:41:51.697
It's been a beautiful ride.

01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:53.434
A beautiful ride?

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:59.111
A beautiful ride.

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:04.049
Dewey, sweetheart,
there's someone here to see you.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.153
Mr. Cox.

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:11.617
I'm sorry, have we met?

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:15.256
You worked with my father,
Kvetch L'Chaim.

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:16.827
You're Mr. L'Chaim's boy?

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:19.498
Dreidel L'Chaim, that's me.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:22.134
Well, it's nice to see you again,
Dreidel L'Chaim.

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:23.564
The pleasure's all mine.

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:27.706
Listen, Mr. Cox,
there's something I want to show you.

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:30.001
I never rock a fella
But I rock a Cinderella

01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:33.008
While she's sittin' in between
A nigga's legs like a cello

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:34.942
Must be those pair of double-Ds

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:37.515
That got a nigga sittin'
Rock-hard in his jeans

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:40.545
Time to play
Make your mouth into a hole, yo

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:41.914
Tell me how I feel
When I'm rockin' your boat

01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:44.249
-I wanna make you fuckin'
-Hard

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:48.260
I'm so wet, I gotta make you

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:52.159
Hard

01:42:54.568 --> 01:42:57.264
Mr. L'Chaim, how could you
allow them to do such a thing...

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:58.870
...with my husband's music?

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:00.869
Through the roof, we're selling.

01:43:01.074 --> 01:43:03.702
Lil' Nutzzak. That's the rapper.
Sweet kid.

01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:07.312
Anyway, he's introduced
a whole new generation...

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:09.482
...to the magic of Dewey Cox.

01:43:09.683 --> 01:43:13.175
You could even play together.
Cox and Lil' Nutzzak. What a package.

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:16.115
Anyway, as if that was not enough...

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:19.053
...they're giving Dewey the Lifetime
Achievement Award next month.

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.892
The Lifetime Achievement Award?

01:43:24.097 --> 01:43:26.793
Baby, that's wonderful.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.527
You go on TV, they give you the award,
you play a song, it's a magical thing.

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:32.997
I can't go on TV and play.

01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:34.572
-What? Why not?
-Why, Grandpa?

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:39.405
Hell, I'm 71 years old. I don't even
know if I can rock no more.

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:41.410
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:43.640
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:45.909
Well, I don't know that I can rock.

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:48.844
And besides that...

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:53.719
...I gave that life up for a reason.

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:57.763
I'm afraid of the temptations,
Darlene.

01:43:57.965 --> 01:44:01.196
You can do it, Dewey.
I know you can.

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:04.233
Just go out there
and sing your song.

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:09.902
I'm gonna need my band.

01:44:20.787 --> 01:44:22.482
My hip.

01:44:38.605 --> 01:44:40.163
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:44.674
...please welcome Jewel, Lyle Lovett
and Jackson Browne.

01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:46.436
Walk hard

01:44:47.981 --> 01:44:49.676
Hard

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:52.048
Down life's

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:54.579
-Rocky road
-Rocky road

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:56.619
Walk bold

01:44:58.325 --> 01:45:00.190
Hard

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.587
That's my creed

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:05.460
-My code
-My code

01:45:05.732 --> 01:45:09.463
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:14.339
Had to struggle every day
My whole life through

01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:18.910
Seen my share of the worst
This world can give

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:24.849
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

01:45:25.285 --> 01:45:27.412
-Hi.
-Hey there.

01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:28.610
Hello.

01:45:28.822 --> 01:45:31.154
Oh, he is so cute.

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:33.519
What are you doing later, Dewey?

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:39.258
I am returning to the hotel
with my family.

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:41.567
Good night to you.

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:45.501
He fucked my grandma.

01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:47.230
That's awesome.

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:48.465
Ghostface Killah.

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:51.442
Walking hard
I'm a real hard walker

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:54.170
Fast on the trigger
And a smooth talker

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:58.715
My guns pop out like a jack-in-the-box
I'll cut you in half like Dewey Cox

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:00.216
-Walk hard
-My skin stays scarred

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.910
You can ask God

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:04.147
Lots of ladies unsnapped they bras

01:46:04.358 --> 01:46:06.826
Ask Lyle Lovett
I had sex on Mars

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:09.427
That's how we do it
When we walk hard

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:12.120
-Walk hard
-How do I walk? Hard as a stone

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:14.562
How do I walk?
Hard like a bone

01:46:14.768 --> 01:46:17.134
-Walk hard
-How do I walk? Like a jackhammer tool

01:46:17.337 --> 01:46:19.771
How do I walk?
Harder than Jewel

01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:24.740
Tell me how we walk
Hard, hard, hard, hard

01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:27.004
Oh, no. You're adorable.

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:30.115
Sam. What are y'all doing in here?

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:33.582
Dewey, get out of here.
You don't want no part of this shit.

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:35.043
What is it?

01:46:35.255 --> 01:46:37.655
It's a medication
for erectile dysfunction.

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.348
It gives you a boner.

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:41.789
Not to be used if you have
a heart condition.

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:45.522
If boners last for more than four hours,
call more ladies.

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:48.258
Well, that does sound tempting.

01:46:48.468 --> 01:46:52.268
But do you know what, Sam?
I really don't want no part of that shit.

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:55.300
Did you hear what I said?
It gives you a boner.

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:57.943
Hate to let you down, old friend...

01:46:58.145 --> 01:47:00.670
...but I don't wanna succumb
to the temptations.

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:03.179
-My girl
-My girl

01:47:03.383 --> 01:47:06.682
Talkin' 'bout my girl, yeah

01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:08.249
My girl

01:47:09.489 --> 01:47:10.717
The Temptations!

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:14.018
When it's cold outside

01:47:14.928 --> 01:47:17.260
I got the month of May

01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:30.001
Do I still have what it takes?

01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:33.577
Am I still the man I used to be?

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:37.709
And do I even want to be?

01:47:38.051 --> 01:47:40.212
You're still Dewey Cox.

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.583
And you're the only man
who ever will be.

01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:45.681
But is that enough?

01:47:45.892 --> 01:47:47.359
It's more than enough.

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:54.426
Nate. Have I fulfilled my promise
to be double great for the both of us?

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:57.728
Are you kidding?
You've made 44 gold records.

01:47:58.138 --> 01:48:00.163
You've been addicted to,
and then kicked...

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:02.068
...almost every drug known to man.

01:48:02.275 --> 01:48:05.438
You slept with 41 1 women
and three men.

01:48:05.645 --> 01:48:08.580
Dewey, you have had
an awesome life.

01:48:08.949 --> 01:48:10.917
I have, haven't I?

01:48:11.117 --> 01:48:12.880
You sure have.

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:17.848
-Pa.
-Son, you learned the hard way.

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:20.891
You can't spend all your time
thinking about Dewey Cox.

01:48:21.094 --> 01:48:23.722
You gotta think about the world
and your family.

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:26.194
But then, at the same time....

01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:27.923
Are you my inner child?

01:48:28.134 --> 01:48:31.103
-Yeah, Dewey, I'm you.
-He's us.

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:34.739
You realized you gotta take care
of Dewey Cox.

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:38.035
That's a little different
than what I was saying.

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:39.473
You're all right.

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:44.707
Pa, inner child, Nate,
my own reflection.

01:48:45.318 --> 01:48:48.810
I've learned that I can't spend
all my time thinking about Dewey Cox.

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:51.547
And I've also learned
I need to love Dewey Cox.

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:54.318
I can't spend all my time
thinking about other people.

01:48:54.528 --> 01:48:56.223
I have to focus on myself.

01:48:56.429 --> 01:49:01.264
But also not focus on myself
and instead focus on other people.

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:03.095
It's all so clear now.

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:06.499
It's not about yourself
and other people.

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.970
-Mama.
-It's about the music.

01:49:09.175 --> 01:49:12.440
-It's about the music.
-It always has been.

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:14.972
It always has been.

01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:17.342
It always has been.

01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:21.216
-Who are you?
-I'm your feminine side.

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:23.946
I've been waiting for you
to get in touch with me.

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:28.423
We heard him sing
about walking hard...

01:49:28.628 --> 01:49:31.859
...and we learned a little something
about how we wanted to walk.

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:35.868
What do we think about
when we think about Cox?

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:37.866
He's been called the Drifter.

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:42.440
Also the Shape Shifter,
the Master Chef, the Chameleon.

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:45.008
The Problem Child. The Hard One.

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:48.112
The White Indian. The Giant Midget.

01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:51.613
If Elvis and Buddy Holly are
the Cain and Abel of rock 'n' roll...

01:49:51.818 --> 01:49:53.979
...and Bruce Springsteen
is Zechariah...

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:55.984
...Iggy Pop is Methuselah...

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:59.818
...and, of course, Neil Young
is the wise prophet Ezekiel...

01:50:00.026 --> 01:50:02.790
...then what does
that make Dewey Cox?

01:50:02.996 --> 01:50:04.725
Well, I don't know what God....

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:06.125
Mr. Cox?

01:50:06.933 --> 01:50:09.458
I don't wanna rush him,
but he goes on in a minute.

01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:15.738
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great honor to introduce...

01:50:15.942 --> 01:50:19.207
...for the first time on-stage
in 25 years...

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:22.472
...performing his final masterpiece...

01:50:22.682 --> 01:50:25.207
...that will sum up his entire life...

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:26.976
Mr. Cox?

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:28.845
...the one, the only...

01:50:29.055 --> 01:50:30.613
I'm ready.

01:50:30.824 --> 01:50:32.758
...Mr. Dewey Cox.

01:50:48.642 --> 01:50:50.633
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.942
You'll forgive me if I'm a bit rusty.

01:50:53.146 --> 01:50:55.910
This is the first song I've written
in a very long time.

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:57.174
I hope you enjoy it.

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:02.083
Now that I have lived

01:51:02.722 --> 01:51:05.885
A lifetime's worth of days

01:51:06.459 --> 01:51:08.950
Finally I see

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:13.527
The folly of my ways

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:17.396
So listen when I sing of

01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:20.569
The temptations of this world

01:51:21.307 --> 01:51:24.299
Fancy cars and needles

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:29.981
Whiskey, flesh and pearls

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:33.046
And then in the end

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:36.487
It's family and friends

01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:39.417
Loving yourself

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:42.318
But not only yourself

01:51:42.696 --> 01:51:46.291
It's about the good walk
And the hard walk

01:51:46.499 --> 01:51:50.458
And the young girls you've made cry

01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:55.232
It's about make a little music
Every day till you die

01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:58.500
It's a beautiful ride

01:51:58.712 --> 01:52:02.512
Beautiful ride

01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:04.308
A beautiful ride

01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:08.647
Beautiful ride

01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:13.784
Beautiful

01:52:13.993 --> 01:52:18.862
Beautiful ride

01:52:19.632 --> 01:52:22.533
As I stand on the precipice of death

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:25.564
My perspective is enormous

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:28.799
Every leaf, every cloud

01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:32.372
I see the hands
Which have formed us

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:35.043
And some days all you got

01:52:35.782 --> 01:52:38.444
Is a nighttime graveyard walk

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:41.844
And you whistle some sweet melody

01:52:42.055 --> 01:52:46.151
To the ghosts down at the dock

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.094
Sing into your hand

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.988
Lead the marching band

01:52:53.633 --> 01:52:58.127
Don't you let 'em fade
Your colors gray

01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:02.401
'Cause when all is said and done

01:53:02.942 --> 01:53:05.467
When youth is spent and burned

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:09.076
You'll see that it's all about

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:10.408
Music

01:53:10.817 --> 01:53:11.977
Flowers

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:13.508
Babies

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:15.781
Sharin' the good times

01:53:15.989 --> 01:53:18.014
Travelin' not just for business

01:53:18.224 --> 01:53:20.658
Accepting your mortality

01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:26.093
This is finally what I've learned

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:29.500
And then in the end

01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:32.637
It's family and friends

01:53:33.406 --> 01:53:35.533
Loving yourself

01:53:35.842 --> 01:53:38.675
But not only yourself

01:53:39.245 --> 01:53:42.214
It's about the good walk
And the hard walk

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:46.678
And the young girls you've made cry

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:52.357
It's about make a little music
Every day till you die

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:54.026
It's a beautiful ride

01:53:54.227 --> 01:53:59.255
Beautiful ride

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:06.200
Beautiful ride

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.673
Beautiful

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:13.102
Beautiful ride

01:54:13.313 --> 01:54:17.909
Beautiful ride

01:54:19.652 --> 01:54:24.954
Beautiful ride

01:54:25.959 --> 01:54:28.723
Beautiful

01:54:29.195 --> 01:54:36.294
Beautiful ride

01:59:35.334 --> 01:59:36.824
Walk hard
