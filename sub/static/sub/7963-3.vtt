Masturbation.

00:16.288 --> 00:19.339
We all do it, but what if I told you,

00:19.424 --> 00:22.626
you've been doing it all wrong?

00:23.795 --> 00:26.630
In his 2008 book "Outliers,"

00:26.715 --> 00:30.717
Malcolm Gladwell argues that
any expert in any given field

00:30.802 --> 00:33.520
must accumulate over 10,000 hours

00:33.605 --> 00:35.939
in his or her own craft.

00:35.974 --> 00:39.276
He calls this the "10,000 Hour Rule."

00:39.311 --> 00:42.775
Well, folks, what about
a 10 million hour rule?

00:44.449 --> 00:47.284
By noon of most days,
I've become desensitized

00:47.319 --> 00:49.736
to even the most outlandish
forms of pornography.

00:49.821 --> 00:53.123
I am just a joyless husk of a man.

00:53.158 --> 00:55.575
So how do I push through it? Hmm?

00:55.661 --> 01:00.380
How do I make myself continue?

01:00.465 --> 01:02.465
Ingenuity.

01:02.501 --> 01:05.969
Say you want to masturbate
to an ex-girlfriend,

01:06.004 --> 01:08.388
or a high school crush
but she's never done porn.

01:08.473 --> 01:11.174
Well, guess you can't
masturbate to her, right?

01:11.260 --> 01:12.926
Wrong!

01:13.011 --> 01:15.345
Take the audio from a porn vid,

01:15.397 --> 01:18.014
and play it under her most
skin-revealing Facebook photos.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.650
Now she's in the action.

01:27.693 --> 01:30.026
Um...

01:30.112 --> 01:33.363
Unfortunately, I have to
go take care of something.

01:35.117 --> 01:36.366
Wish me luck.

01:36.451 --> 01:37.450
Whoo!

02:05.030 --> 02:07.564
I'm not even eating it for
the marshmallows anymore.

02:07.649 --> 02:11.067
I actually look forward to the oat pieces.

02:11.153 --> 02:13.653
Guess I'm getting older.

02:13.739 --> 02:15.405
Josh?

02:15.490 --> 02:16.406
Are you even listening to me?

02:16.491 --> 02:18.074
No, no. Sorry.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.243
What, I'm just kind of
in the middle of a thing

02:20.329 --> 02:22.128
with the girl across the bar.

02:22.214 --> 02:23.797
- Ooh, which one?
- Don't... don't look, don't look.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.749
I'm trying to take a long game approach.

02:25.834 --> 02:28.051
facial recognition.

02:28.086 --> 02:31.388
Just want to plant the
seed. That way maybe sometime

02:31.423 --> 02:33.840
weeks from now I bump
into her and she goes,

02:33.925 --> 02:36.176
"Hey, don't I recognize
you from someplace?"

02:36.261 --> 02:39.262
And I'll be like, "Huh. I don't know.

02:39.348 --> 02:40.897
Do you? Maybe?"

02:40.932 --> 02:42.649
That sounds like a really long game.

02:42.734 --> 02:44.851
Ah, I figure what's the hurry, right?

02:55.447 --> 02:58.415
H-Hello?

03:05.290 --> 03:08.124
Aah! Aah! Aah!

03:08.210 --> 03:09.042
Aah!

03:13.131 --> 03:14.130
Aah!

03:20.272 --> 03:23.306
Oh, God.

03:23.392 --> 03:25.308
Are you here to kill me?

03:28.146 --> 03:29.479
No, no? So then, what, what?

03:29.564 --> 03:31.648
What? What do you want?

03:31.733 --> 03:35.318
My teeth? My mouth? My face. My...

03:35.404 --> 03:36.786
My hair?

03:41.326 --> 03:43.827
Oh, God, it's gonna look that bad?

03:43.912 --> 03:45.412
Ah, oh! No!

03:45.497 --> 03:47.714
But I'm only 28. I'm too young to go bald!

03:47.799 --> 03:50.633
No, okay! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:50.669 --> 03:52.168
Okay, what can I do? What can I...

03:52.254 --> 03:54.087
Rogaine! I'll start doing Rogaine, right?

03:54.172 --> 03:55.755
That can buy me some time, if I start using

03:55.841 --> 03:57.974
the creams and the gels, right?

03:58.009 --> 04:00.343
No. Okay, so,

04:00.429 --> 04:02.679
So no hair. Guys look good without hair.

04:02.731 --> 04:04.514
Like Jason Statham.

04:06.101 --> 04:09.269
Yeah, I know, okay, I'm not Jason Statham.

04:09.354 --> 04:11.654
Man, I feel like... black
guys. If I were black, like...

04:11.690 --> 04:14.908
'Cause black guys can pull off
the bald look, I think, right?

04:14.993 --> 04:16.358
Like...

04:16.445 --> 04:18.862
I suppose they have it bad in other ways,

04:18.947 --> 04:21.447
like oppression.

04:21.533 --> 04:25.034
I mean, I mean, would you...
would you make that trade?

04:27.672 --> 04:31.257
Yeah, it is interesting. It is interesting.

04:31.343 --> 04:32.709
No!

04:32.794 --> 04:34.377
Oh! Oh! Oh!

04:38.216 --> 04:41.017
So, it's like a gradual process.

04:41.052 --> 04:45.688
Okay, so, ballpark, how
much time we looking at here?

04:48.527 --> 04:51.394
No!

04:51.480 --> 04:54.063
I've got to hurry.

05:03.785 --> 05:04.985
Man.

05:06.062 --> 05:07.478
God damn it.

05:09.232 --> 05:10.531
Oh, my God.

05:13.236 --> 05:15.569
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold one second.

05:17.490 --> 05:19.907
Hey!

05:19.992 --> 05:23.544
Hey. What's... what's with the hat?

05:23.579 --> 05:25.162
You know, I'm just trying a new look.

05:25.248 --> 05:27.381
It's, uh, business on the bottom,

05:27.417 --> 05:30.000
party atop my head.

05:30.086 --> 05:32.336
- What would you like for dinner?
- Give me that hat, all right?

05:32.422 --> 05:33.921
- You look so ridiculous.
- No, no!

05:33.973 --> 05:35.056
What? It looks ridiculous.

05:35.091 --> 05:37.091
I'm... I got a... I got a...

05:37.176 --> 05:40.561
- What?
- I'm going bald, Liz.

05:40.596 --> 05:43.180
I don't see it. Where?

05:43.266 --> 05:44.098
I can't see it. There's a spot.

05:44.183 --> 05:45.766
There's a spot.

05:45.818 --> 05:48.853
- Right here, there's like a...
- Right there?

05:48.938 --> 05:51.072
I think you're overreacting, there.

05:51.107 --> 05:52.857
I'm not over... you don't
know what this is like.

05:52.942 --> 05:55.776
Imagine just trying to date,
and there's this one part

05:55.862 --> 05:58.245
of your body that you have no control over,

05:58.281 --> 06:00.948
that has, like, a ticking clock to it.

06:03.286 --> 06:04.952
Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough.

06:05.004 --> 06:07.788
My point is, I need to
lock something down now.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.090
I need to get in there.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.125
I need to lock something down yesterday,

06:11.177 --> 06:15.463
and I'm not above lowering
my expectations to do that.

06:15.548 --> 06:18.132
Wait, what? Why? What does that mean?

06:18.184 --> 06:20.351
I don't need someone with
all the bells and whistles.

06:20.436 --> 06:25.139
I just need someone
safe. Reliable, you know.

06:25.224 --> 06:26.941
Sounds like you're talking about a car.

06:29.278 --> 06:31.445
Maybe I am.

06:31.481 --> 06:33.147
Maybe I am.

06:35.401 --> 06:38.152
Mike, Liz, I want you to
meet my new girlfriend.

06:38.237 --> 06:40.287
She's a 1998 Saturn.

06:41.791 --> 06:43.657
Hi... hi.

06:43.743 --> 06:45.493
What's up? I'm Mike.

06:46.829 --> 06:48.712
Hey, man.

06:48.798 --> 06:50.247
You want to come hit up the buffet with me?

06:50.333 --> 06:52.166
- Oh, yeah, you got it.
- Cool.

06:52.251 --> 06:53.134
All right, I'll see you in a bit.

06:53.169 --> 06:55.669
Mwah!

06:55.721 --> 06:58.672
Uh, don't listen to anything
this one says about me.

06:58.758 --> 07:00.474
- Oh, gosh.
- Nice to meet you.

07:01.677 --> 07:03.427
Well, I love your hubcaps.

07:05.348 --> 07:07.982
- So you're attracted to her?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:08.017 --> 07:10.234
I'm not blind... I know she
doesn't have the kind of body

07:10.319 --> 07:14.071
you'd see on the cover of
"Penthouse" or "Car and Driver"

07:14.157 --> 07:16.190
or something, but...

07:16.242 --> 07:18.025
We... we make it work.

07:20.196 --> 07:21.745
How, exactly?

07:21.831 --> 07:23.247
Ah, that's pretty personal.

07:23.332 --> 07:27.368
Would you say that you...
put it in her gas hole?

07:27.420 --> 07:29.954
- Mike!
- Well, do you? I don't know.

07:41.133 --> 07:42.716
Yes.

07:42.768 --> 07:44.969
God, um, and... and... and...

07:47.139 --> 07:50.357
Do you, uh, complete the act?

07:53.229 --> 07:56.313
- Yes.
- My God.

07:56.399 --> 08:00.367
Well, look, is it the
best sex I've ever had? No.

08:00.403 --> 08:03.487
Does it get the job done? Sort of.

08:03.573 --> 08:06.323
Does it hurt? Well, I'm
sticking my cock into a gas tank,

08:06.409 --> 08:09.326
so yes, but I'm just
happy to have a girlfriend.

08:09.412 --> 08:11.412
Well, as long as you're happy, man.

08:11.464 --> 08:13.998
Michael, I couldn't be happier.

08:44.447 --> 08:45.412
Hey, hey.

08:46.866 --> 08:50.618
Yeah.

09:17.730 --> 09:20.981
Ouch.

09:21.033 --> 09:23.484
Oh! Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

09:23.536 --> 09:24.818
Ow! Ow!

09:26.689 --> 09:28.372
Josh doesn't bring a lot of ladies home,

09:28.457 --> 09:30.791
so this is a real treat.

09:35.665 --> 09:38.716
Uh, are you sure I can't
get you a glass of wine?

09:38.801 --> 09:42.419
Oh, well, actually, she doesn't drink.

09:42.505 --> 09:43.837
How about some brisket?

09:43.889 --> 09:46.924
She doesn't eat meat.

09:47.009 --> 09:49.510
Just gas, usually.

09:49.595 --> 09:52.313
No only, she... all she eats is gas.

09:52.348 --> 09:53.764
Neato.

09:57.987 --> 10:02.406
Well, I think I'll clear some plates.

10:02.491 --> 10:04.742
Josh, would you mind helping me?

10:04.827 --> 10:06.327
Oh, yeah, not at all.

10:06.362 --> 10:10.414
So, thank you, uh, for having us over.

10:10.499 --> 10:11.865
Mmm.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.834
And I can tell she really likes you.

10:13.869 --> 10:18.539
Josh, you know that Tom
and I love you very much,

10:18.591 --> 10:22.009
and you know that we
will always support you.

10:22.044 --> 10:25.262
- Mm-hmm.
- Having said that,

10:25.348 --> 10:27.181
this is a tough one.

10:27.216 --> 10:29.433
What do you mean?

10:29.518 --> 10:33.937
I think you're settling, Josh,
and I don't want you to settle!

10:34.023 --> 10:38.108
I want you to be with
the person, or the car,

10:38.194 --> 10:41.395
or the boat, or whatever you think

10:41.447 --> 10:43.063
is the absolute best.

10:43.115 --> 10:46.817
Why? Why? It's not like
I'm the absolute best.

10:46.902 --> 10:51.789
- Oh, Joshy!
- Seriously, Mom, I'm a...

10:51.874 --> 10:54.575
balding 28-year-old temp.

10:54.660 --> 10:58.579
I think this midsize sedan is
about the best I'll ever do,

10:58.664 --> 11:03.834
which... which is why I'm
gonna ask her to marry me.

11:06.138 --> 11:08.922
Oh.

11:08.974 --> 11:10.140
Well.

11:11.811 --> 11:13.811
This is a tough one.

11:18.984 --> 11:21.151
Would you do me the honor

11:21.237 --> 11:24.405
of taking me as I am on bended knee?

11:26.275 --> 11:27.991
Oh, shit. The ring.

11:28.077 --> 11:30.611
The ring, the ring, the ring.

11:30.696 --> 11:32.413
Very important.

11:32.448 --> 11:34.665
Oh, right, yeah.

11:36.252 --> 11:38.252
Yeah.

11:38.287 --> 11:40.621
- Saturn, I'm home.
- Ah, you're dirty.

11:40.706 --> 11:42.506
- You are dirty!
- What the hell?

11:42.591 --> 11:44.541
- Ah, Jesus!
- Oh, my God!

11:44.627 --> 11:46.293
- Oh...
- Aah!

11:46.378 --> 11:48.378
Hey, hey, it's not what
it looks like, I'm sorry.

11:48.464 --> 11:50.848
- Get out of my house!
- Can I finish?

11:50.933 --> 11:52.633
No, you can't finish! Get out of here!

11:52.685 --> 11:53.851
Sorry, sorry.

11:56.639 --> 11:58.806
You too!

11:58.891 --> 11:59.773
Sorry.

12:05.314 --> 12:06.213
Yes, ma'am.

12:18.770 --> 12:20.720
Hey, buddy.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.889
What are you doing all alone in the corner?

12:22.975 --> 12:25.392
Mike, I've been doing

12:25.444 --> 12:28.311
some thinking about life,

12:28.397 --> 12:30.981
and I've come to the conclusion

12:31.066 --> 12:32.782
I'm the most pathetic
piece of shit on the planet.

12:32.868 --> 12:34.401
Ah, don't say that.

12:34.486 --> 12:36.369
It's true, though. It's true.

12:36.405 --> 12:39.573
I just keep getting rejected.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.575
And even when I settle,

12:41.660 --> 12:43.743
I still get cheated on
with three other guys.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.712
- Thought it was two guys.
- No, no.

12:45.747 --> 12:47.497
A third was discovered.

12:47.583 --> 12:52.135
I'm a miserable bald piece of shit

12:52.221 --> 12:54.254
in a stupid beanie.

12:54.339 --> 12:57.307
You know what, I don't
think... I don't care anymore.

12:57.392 --> 12:59.426
I don't even care anymore. That's it.

12:59.478 --> 13:02.345
Take a look, everybody.
Take a look at the freak!

13:02.431 --> 13:03.847
Shut up, shut up.

13:03.932 --> 13:05.815
There's a crazy hot girl over there.

13:05.901 --> 13:09.486
All right, don't look,
don't look, don't look.

13:09.571 --> 13:10.570
Hey, what are you doing?

13:12.691 --> 13:14.441
I'm gonna ask her out.

13:14.526 --> 13:16.159
How are you so confident all of a sudden?

13:16.245 --> 13:17.444
You were just talking
about what a loser you are.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.279
That's just it.

13:19.348 --> 13:23.783
I'm such a loser, I gots
nothing left to lose.

13:40.719 --> 13:43.553
Hey, you want to date,
like, a creepy bald guy?

13:43.639 --> 13:45.522
- No.
- Cool.

13:45.607 --> 13:49.059
Dude, that was crazy. Sorry.

13:49.144 --> 13:49.976
- Want to date?
- Go away.

13:50.028 --> 13:51.978
Yep.

13:52.030 --> 13:53.446
- I'm Josh, you want to party?
- No.

13:53.482 --> 13:56.032
Makes sense.

13:56.118 --> 13:57.867
- Should we do this?
- Gross.

13:57.953 --> 14:00.987
- All right.
- Dude, that was insane.

14:01.039 --> 14:03.490
I've never seen somebody get
rejected so many times in a row.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.241
How are you still alive?

14:05.327 --> 14:06.826
Because I use my secret weapon:

14:06.878 --> 14:08.712
not giving a shit.

14:08.797 --> 14:10.497
Yeah, well, you know who will give a shit.

14:10.582 --> 14:13.750
Greenberg!

14:13.835 --> 14:15.385
You're a loose cannon!

14:15.470 --> 14:17.554
You can't walk straight up to girls!

14:17.639 --> 14:19.389
It's too direct.

14:19.474 --> 14:21.725
You got to be cool.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.593
You got to make small talk.

14:23.679 --> 14:25.929
Talk about the "Game of Thrones."

14:26.014 --> 14:30.317
At least play the college
name game, for Christ's sake!

14:33.405 --> 14:35.855
God damn it, Greenberg.

14:35.907 --> 14:37.407
Put that out!

14:40.996 --> 14:43.863
Holy shit!

14:43.915 --> 14:46.166
That's unnecessary, man.

14:46.201 --> 14:47.701
Get out!

14:52.457 --> 14:53.923
Wait, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

14:54.009 --> 14:55.342
There's a real hot girl at Flanagan's.

14:55.377 --> 14:56.876
She's been there two hours now

14:56.962 --> 14:57.877
and everyone's too afraid to hit on her.

14:57.929 --> 14:59.879
Let's roll.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.297
Now, Josh, wait.

15:01.383 --> 15:02.766
It sounds like she's really hot, man.

15:02.851 --> 15:05.802
We got to think this through. Josh! Ugh!

15:05.887 --> 15:07.387
I'm getting too old for this shit.

15:11.059 --> 15:12.776
Get this shit out of my face.

15:17.199 --> 15:19.899
- What's the sitch?
- It's worse than we thought.

15:19.951 --> 15:21.534
That super-hot woman is
in there with her friends,

15:21.570 --> 15:23.570
and they're really hot too.

15:23.655 --> 15:25.572
The guys inside are scared, all right?

15:25.657 --> 15:27.073
There's no way anyone's gonna hit on her.

15:27.159 --> 15:28.992
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

15:29.077 --> 15:32.245
Hi, sorry.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.297
Why does someone have to hit on her?

15:34.383 --> 15:36.249
Well, because she's hot.

15:36.334 --> 15:37.801
Okay, but, so what?

15:37.886 --> 15:42.005
Why does an attractive
woman have to be hit on?

15:42.090 --> 15:43.723
It just doesn't make sense.

15:46.228 --> 15:48.344
- Somebody get her out of here!
- Good. All right.

15:48.430 --> 15:50.430
What's the game plan?

15:50.515 --> 15:52.315
Well, we need a guy on the inside,

15:52.401 --> 15:53.566
talking close to her about something

15:53.602 --> 15:54.984
she can kind of latch on to.

15:55.070 --> 15:56.853
The latest episode of "Empire."

15:56.938 --> 15:58.321
Then maybe, hopefully,
she can say something like,

15:58.407 --> 15:59.823
"Hey, you guys talking about 'Empire'?"

15:59.908 --> 16:02.659
- And then we can say...
- No, no. Screw that.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.360
I'm going in. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

16:04.446 --> 16:05.779
You can't go straight up to her, man.

16:05.831 --> 16:06.780
It's a suicide mission.

16:06.865 --> 16:08.782
You think I care?

16:08.834 --> 16:10.500
I'm loco.

16:27.969 --> 16:30.053
Excuse me, I need to talk
to your friend for a second.

16:38.063 --> 16:40.063
Hi, I'm Josh. You want to go on a date?

16:40.148 --> 16:42.482
You want to reject me?
You want to reject me?

16:42.567 --> 16:45.318
You want to reject me? Go
on, reject me, reject me.

16:45.370 --> 16:48.621
I live for this shit.
Just do me a favor, babe.

16:48.657 --> 16:50.824
Do it right to my face.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.243
- I'll go out with you.
- What?

16:53.328 --> 16:55.462
I'll go on a date with you.

16:55.497 --> 16:57.247
Well, so, when? When should we do this?

16:57.332 --> 16:59.749
When's good for you? I'm available, always.

16:59.835 --> 17:01.551
I mean, you know what? Let's just...

17:01.636 --> 17:04.554
Let's just... let's just give
each other... exchange info,

17:04.638 --> 17:08.724
like we're in a car accident,
and we will figure out

17:08.810 --> 17:11.478
the logistics of everything later on.

17:11.512 --> 17:12.929
Okay.

17:20.521 --> 17:24.824
He may be crazy, but god
damn it, he gets the job done.

17:24.859 --> 17:26.326
Occasionally.

17:26.361 --> 17:27.993
Hey, you better not say "I told you so."

17:28.029 --> 17:29.445
Okay.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.414
- But I told you so.
- Hey!

17:35.822 --> 17:37.222
I want to know how the date went.

17:37.342 --> 17:38.149
Terrible.

17:38.477 --> 17:40.598
I got nervous and went on a rant

17:40.683 --> 17:42.850
about the plot holes in "Prometheus."

17:42.935 --> 17:44.735
- How long?
- Pretty long.

17:44.771 --> 17:47.405
I mean, it's a long movie.
It's rife with plot holes.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.490
Did you use the word "rife"?

17:49.575 --> 17:51.442
- Several times.
- Yeah.

17:51.527 --> 17:54.161
Anyway, at least I went for it, right?

17:54.247 --> 17:56.113
And just 'cause it
didn't work out this time,

17:56.199 --> 17:58.582
doesn't mean I won't try again.

17:58.618 --> 18:00.201
Good.

18:00.286 --> 18:01.836
I'm just glad you got
rid of that stupid hat.

18:01.921 --> 18:03.371
Yeah, me too.

18:23.059 --> 18:24.358
Watch out!

18:32.869 --> 18:35.236
Saturn, what the hell are you doing here?

18:37.874 --> 18:39.240
How much have you had to drink?

18:41.360 --> 18:42.910
Really? That doesn't sound like two beers.

18:49.168 --> 18:51.335
No, no, no, no.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.005
Why do you think? Because
you treated me like crap,

18:55.091 --> 18:56.507
all right, and I moved on.

18:56.559 --> 18:59.427
So please do me a favor,
vacate the premises.

19:01.681 --> 19:02.847
Reverse.

19:04.016 --> 19:06.350
Hey, reverse!
