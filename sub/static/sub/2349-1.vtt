WEBVTT

00:58.850 --> 01:02.445
So thanks very much for having
me in and here's my pitch.

01:02.545 --> 01:07.335
This is a movie I've had in my head for
a long time. It's a comedy. Hopefully.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.585
Anyway...

01:08.902 --> 01:12.389
Let's say Jack Nicholson decided

01:12.489 --> 01:14.475
that he wanted to know
what people truly thought of him.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.060
Whether his life had
actually amounted to anything.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.935
So he fakes his death
and stages his own funeral.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.152
I just think the possibilities
are pretty hilarious.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.407
Ultimately, amid all the cliché eulogies

01:30.507 --> 01:32.659
and insincere expressions of grief,

01:32.759 --> 01:36.363
he discovers one grandson
who truly misses him.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.078
It could be very heartwarming.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.206
I don't get this.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.460
Just like I didn't get it when
you pitched it to me six months ago.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.216
I did? Where was that?

01:47.316 --> 01:49.589
At the Red Sunset premiere.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.337
Glad I left such an
impression that night.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.848
Oh, right, sorry, yeah, yeah.
I knew I knew you.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.350
Sorry. Yes! Yes!

01:56.450 --> 01:59.770
Yeah, you were between jobs
and looking for a development position.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.981
So, bravo! No, that was a great night.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.611
Oh, of course, there's no reason
why it couldn't be a woman.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.984
You know, everyone loves Betty White.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.782
Keith, we love you.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.074
We're huge fans.

02:13.425 --> 02:16.828
This is the studio that made
your Paradise Misplaced 15 years ago,

02:16.928 --> 02:19.807
when Jenny over here was just an embryo.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.827
It's a fun idea, it's just not for us.

02:24.561 --> 02:30.717
We're looking more for edgy comedies
with a kick-ass-type woman.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.921
Now if you have something like that,
we'd love to hear it.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.788
You are a fantastic agent
as you have frequently told me.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.125
I just wanted to ask, do you think
you could possibly find me just...

03:03.225 --> 03:05.498
Just one job, you know? Just any job.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.999
OK.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.755
There is something.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.173
You have to hear me out.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.716
If it pays, I'll take it.

03:12.109 --> 03:16.263
My brother-in-law is a chem professor at
Binghamton University in upstate New York,

03:16.363 --> 03:18.682
and they're looking for a writer
in residence this semester,

03:18.782 --> 03:21.635
cos the one they had died,
so I thought of you.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.522
You thought of me for a teaching job?

03:25.622 --> 03:28.025
Look, you're going to teach
a screenwriting class.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.569
You're going to take some time
to figure out your life

03:30.669 --> 03:31.737
and write something great.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.823
And they're going to give you a car,
a house, a salary.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.575
Yeah, a pitiful one I don't doubt.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.368
Well, it's a lot more
than you're making now.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.371
Yeah, but I can't teach
and I hate teachers, you know.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.915
They're frustrated losers who haven't
done anything with their own lives

03:44.015 --> 03:45.412
so they want to instruct other people.

03:45.809 --> 03:49.789
Oh, forget it, I will just
write my script on spec and...

03:54.192 --> 03:55.293
Keith?

03:57.487 --> 04:01.592
OK. Where exactly is Binghamton?

04:06.580 --> 04:10.942
The city of Binghamton is
2,754 miles from Los Angeles

04:11.042 --> 04:14.316
and 172 miles northwest
of New York City.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.861
IBM was founded there.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.036
Sir, is this your bag?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.997
- Yeah.
- Well, we have to check it.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.323
OK.

04:25.891 --> 04:29.495
Rod Serling, creator of Twilight Zone
grew up and was raised there.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.127
I admit there's a somewhat
ominous quality to that factoid.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.470
What is this?

04:39.487 --> 04:42.091
"Best Original Screenplay."

04:42.866 --> 04:45.519
Dude, you wrote Paradise Misplaced?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.104
I did. Yeah, yeah.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.939
That's such a great flick.

04:49.039 --> 04:53.731
- Thank you. Thanks very much.
- Yo, Kevin, Ali, come here.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.447
This is Keith Michaels.
He wrote Paradise Misplaced.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.824
- You wrote that?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:58.924 --> 05:01.618
- A long time ago but I did, yeah.
- Oh, I love that movie, man.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.912
- My kids love that movie.
- Thank you, thank you, I appreciate it.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.789
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

05:05.889 --> 05:06.915
Wow, look at this.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.292
I could have brought a bomb on board
and no one would have minded.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.835
Don't say that. That's not good.

05:13.438 --> 05:17.208
Oh, you're so right. I'm sorry.
I apologise. I used to know what was funny.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.590
Thank you. Thank you.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.810
Binghamton is also the
birthplace of the Spiedie,

05:26.910 --> 05:30.105
a sandwich consisting of cubes
of marinated beef, chicken, or pork

05:30.205 --> 05:32.023
grilled over a charcoal pit.

05:38.213 --> 05:42.534
Binghamton is amongst the top 10
most cloudy and rainy American cities.

05:43.677 --> 05:48.032
On the plus side, it is considered
"the carousel capital of the world".

05:51.101 --> 05:53.454
It has never been the
site of a major riot.

05:54.604 --> 05:58.459
And from what I can tell so far,
it is the absolute end of civilisation.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.012
It's impossible to know what
anyone could have to teach here

06:02.112 --> 06:03.714
except "get out".

07:33.370 --> 07:34.847
Can I help you with something?

07:35.205 --> 07:38.400
Oh, sorry. I'm just a bit jet-lagged.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.860
I just flew in from LA.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.903
- You came here from LA?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.197
I have come to teach at the college.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.033
- What are you teaching?
- Writing. Screenwriting.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.368
You're Keith Michaels?

07:48.468 --> 07:51.162
I submitted a screenplay for that class.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.455
He wrote Paradise Misplaced.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.332
Are you kidding me?

07:54.432 --> 07:55.625
Come sit with us.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.210
No, I don't want to impose...

07:57.310 --> 08:00.004
Dude, you have to. It's only
my favourite movie of all time.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.841
OK, I will... I will obey.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.381
Thank you.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.807
I'm Karen. This is Judy and Chloe.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.268
Right. What are you
all majoring in then?

08:13.368 --> 08:14.769
- I'm pre-med.
- Really?

08:14.869 --> 08:17.314
And where do you
stand on full body scans?

08:17.414 --> 08:21.067
Would you say helpful or would you say
cancer-causing cash conduits?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.361
- Well, I mean...
- Nice alliteration.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.487
I'm an English major.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.564
I thought I recognised
a fellow sufferer.

08:27.257 --> 08:30.368
And Chloe is majoring in...

08:34.097 --> 08:35.498
Telepathy?

08:35.597 --> 08:37.292
I can't believe you wrote that movie.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.169
That's absolutely, truly cool.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.791
Nice assonance.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.883
- Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds.
- Vowel sounds.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.424
Look at me. Teaching already.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.264
I really want to take your course.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.886
Well, that's good news.
I thought maybe no one would.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.392
Fantastic.

09:38.953 --> 09:43.437
Henry, no. Sorry. Henry's not used
to seeing people in the house.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.648
I'm Jim.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.443
Hi, Jim. Henry.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.778
I've got to get ready for work.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.121
Right. No problem.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.042
Hey.

10:11.374 --> 10:12.383
Good morning.

10:14.146 --> 10:17.183
I unfortunately have to go. I'm supposed
to meet the head of the department.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.135
Dr Lerner. I had him for Chaucer.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.214
When you say you
"had him" for Chaucer...

10:22.914 --> 10:25.312
- This was really fun.
- Yeah.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.435
- See you later.
- Yeah.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.322
I like being a teacher.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.466
Harold Lerner. How was your trip?

10:49.566 --> 10:50.925
It was nice. Thank you.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.303
We could have had somebody
meet you at the airport.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.389
I'm sure one of our nerdier English majors
would have been happy to do that.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.599
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.434
Although I have actually met
some of the students,

10:59.534 --> 11:01.603
and they're extremely generous
with their time.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.022
Oh, sure, yeah, they're friendly.
Most of them are high.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.860
US Marine Corps.
I... I like to follow the rules.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.488
Well, Writers Guild of America.
I feel exactly the same.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.781
Excellent.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.033
Let me grab something
and I'll show you to your new digs.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.325
Yeah, yeah.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.035
Good use of their parents'
tuition money.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.668
Well, here's your new home
away from home.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.639
That's lovely. Yeah, thank you.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.936
Oh, there's a little faculty get-together
at 5:00 tonight in the Susquehanna Lounge.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.480
Give you a chance to meet
the rest of the department.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.981
Good. Great.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.692
- All right. Give me a call if you need anything.
- Yep, yep, yep.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.522
Thank you. Oh, Dr Lerner,
you forgot your box.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.532
Oh, I'm sorry, no. That's yours.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.952
That's the 30-page screenplays
submitted by all the students

11:59.052 --> 12:00.529
who wanna take your course.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.205
About 70 of them.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.706
And you teach day after tomorrow,

12:03.806 --> 12:06.084
so we're going to need
your selections right away.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.752
You only have to pick 10.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.045
We would have let you know sooner,

12:09.145 --> 12:12.374
but we didn't know you were
taking the job until a couple days ago.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.050
OK.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.672
- Happy reading.
- Yeah.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.138
Mr Michaels! Mr Michaels!

13:00.238 --> 13:01.555
Hi.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.141
Hi.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.768
Oh, I'm glad I caught you
before the faculty reception.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.140
I'm Holly Carpenter.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.565
Hello. Hello.
And what do you teach, Holly?

13:10.665 --> 13:14.944
What, teach? No, I don't teach.
I learn. I'm a sophomore.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.821
Really?

13:16.921 --> 13:20.283
Oh, you are? That's great. That's good.
It's wonderful going back to school at your...

13:20.383 --> 13:21.618
- Height?
- Yes, exactly.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.036
I thought that's what you meant.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.787
It was, it was. We're very simpatico.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.706
Holly, listen,
I'm a little late for this thing.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.125
Am I going the right way
to the Susquehanna Lounge?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.710
Yes, it's straight ahead.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.128
OK, great. Thank you.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.751
I'm actually a psych major.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.716
And...

13:36.816 --> 13:38.301
We have a lit requirement,

13:38.401 --> 13:43.139
and I've written short stories
and I've written poems. I love writing.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.390
I have an idea for a screenplay,

13:44.490 --> 13:47.268
I know the class submission deadline
was yesterday...

13:47.368 --> 13:51.481
But I stayed up last night and wrote this
and I hope that you would still consider me.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.183
Thank you. Thank you.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.027
Oh, I've got to tell you,
I love Paradise Misplaced.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.695
I still watch it with my girls.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.943
Oh, your girls? Are you a lesbian?

14:01.122 --> 14:03.326
I wish. No, my daughters.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.494
Of course. Well, of course.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.247
Well, I hope you watch a DVD
and not one of those illegal web sites.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.749
Oh, I didn't know that was an option.
I'll have to check that out.

14:10.369 --> 14:14.295
A criminal. Now I will read this
with genuine interest.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.506
OK, thank you. Thank you.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.878
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.670
- I hope you like it.
- Oh, yeah.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.065
Thank you very much.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.734
- That is quite... Thank you. Yeah.
- You're welcome.

14:43.224 --> 14:47.821
Hi, Jim Harper. My dog, Henry IV, and I
were peering in your window this morning.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.373
Yes, wow. That was, that was...
That was unusual.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.042
Yeah. Henry kind of walks me.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.421
- Listen, I love your movie.
- Oh, thank you very much, thank you.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.048
I've actually written three,
and a co-writing credit on another.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.719
Oh, wow, I didn't know that. That's terrific.
Jeez, I wish I could do what you do.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.055
Oh, so do I. And what do you do, Jim?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.390
I teach Shakespeare.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.393
Excuse me. Keith, I'd like you to meet
some of our other English faculty.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.645
This is Ron Jenson, Medieval Literature.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.064
Pleasure. I really love your movie.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.732
Oh, thanks, the movies...

15:17.542 --> 15:20.153
Paul Prentiss, American Lit.
Great to have you here.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.237
Great, thanks a lot.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.782
- Hi, Naomi Watkins, African Literature.
- Nice to meet you, Naomi. I'm Keith.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.952
Clara Foss, fellow writer, resident poet.
Welcome aboard.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.246
Well, that didn't rhyme at all.
I doubt your credentials.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.289
And this is Professor Mary Weldon.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.880
Professor Weldon holds the Bainbridge Chair
in Comparative Literature

15:38.980 --> 15:41.382
and she's about to publish
what will prove to be

15:41.482 --> 15:45.131
- the definitive work on Jane Austen.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.389
- You don't like Jane Austen?
- No, no, she's obviously brilliant.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.726
It's just I find it all
a bit trivial, you know?

15:51.826 --> 15:54.354
Really? That's fascinating. How so?

15:54.454 --> 15:57.523
Well, isn't it all, you know,
"Who's going to the ball tonight?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.817
"My corset is askew.
However will I curtsey?"

16:02.044 --> 16:03.279
I'd also like you to meet...

16:03.379 --> 16:05.406
In other words, why should
a 21st century man care

16:05.506 --> 16:07.658
about the obstacles facing
a 19th century woman?

16:07.758 --> 16:10.745
No, that makes me sound like a misogynist.
I love and respect women.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.121
As long as they're not writing.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.995
On the contrary, there are
myriad women writers I adore.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.873
- Can you name one?
- Elaine May.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.171
I'm not familiar with her work.

16:20.271 --> 16:24.547
Oh, she wrote A New Leaf, The Birdcage,
she did an uncredited rewrite on Tootsie.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.388
Movies?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.681
We're talking about literature.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.810
And while you may not think much
of the women writers of that period,

16:33.910 --> 16:36.020
Austen, Woolf, and the Bronte sisters
were artists

16:36.120 --> 16:39.065
who represented
the female empowerment of their age.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.441
Oh, well, forgive me,

16:40.541 --> 16:42.985
but I'm just a little bit tired
of "female empowerment."

16:43.085 --> 16:45.279
Whoa! Battle stations.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.324
Dr Lerner, you must
have an opinion on this?

16:48.924 --> 16:51.994
I have a wife and four daughters.
I have no opinions.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.997
What exactly is
your opinion, Mr Michaels?

16:55.097 --> 16:57.708
- Another glass?
- Thank you so much, that's nice.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.587
It's just, honestly, everything seems to be
about female empowerment nowadays.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.965
You know, any meeting I go
to in Hollywood, someone says,

17:04.065 --> 17:06.925
"You know what we need? A kick-ass girl.
That would be a great twist."

17:07.026 --> 17:08.845
Except every movie has a kick-ass girl.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.931
You know, some martial-arts,
CGI, slow-motion woman

17:12.031 --> 17:14.642
who kicks the crap out of
every man in her path.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.645
Can I tell you what would be
truly innovative?

17:17.744 --> 17:19.771
A movie without a kick-ass girl.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.271
Or, better yet, a movie where
a woman gets her ass kicked.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.241
Perhaps you'd like to kick mine.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.532
No, don't be silly.
I didn't mean literally.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.514
Besides, not much of a target there.

17:37.515 --> 17:41.293
Which I mean in a very nice way...
Cos you are in great shape.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.045
You're... You're svelte.

17:43.668 --> 17:46.381
This... I'm sure you'd like to meet...

17:48.150 --> 17:49.251
Somebody.

17:59.787 --> 18:03.107
Hey. So this worked out great, right?

18:03.874 --> 18:05.693
Two of us living right
next door to each other.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.612
- Yeah.
- I'll give you a lift in tomorrow.

18:07.712 --> 18:08.696
Oh, thank you, Jim.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.407
You know, you're a lovely man
with an unusual dog...

18:11.507 --> 18:13.326
But I don't think I can do this.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.200
I actually miss LA,
and I didn't think that was possible.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.290
"O thou invisible spirit of wine,

18:19.390 --> 18:22.334
"if thou hast no name to be
known by, let us call thee devil!"

18:24.645 --> 18:25.755
When I was younger,

18:25.855 --> 18:28.299
I thought having the perfect
Shakespeare quote for any situation

18:28.399 --> 18:29.625
would make me beloved.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.302
It's surprisingly unhelpful.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.970
Yeah, it seems to really annoy people.

18:33.704 --> 18:35.798
Sorry, hang on, hang on, hang on.

18:39.410 --> 18:42.146
I'm going to have to take this.
I think I can find my house from here.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.148
OK, sure, you go for it.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.025
- Listen though...
- Hang on one second.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.820
Give teaching a shot, OK?
It gets its hooks in you, you'll see.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.239
With all respect, I don't believe

18:51.339 --> 18:53.533
that anything worth knowing
can be taught in a classroom.

18:53.633 --> 18:57.286
And I intend to do as little as possible
while carrying on with this charade.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.160
Yeah, if I gave it any thought,
I'd probably feel the same way.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.457
Yeah, hi.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.001
Oh, hi. I'm stuck in traffic,
I thought I'd check in. How's it going?

19:04.101 --> 19:07.129
I'm very, very, very, very cold, and,

19:07.229 --> 19:09.131
I have to read a huge box of scripts,

19:09.231 --> 19:12.843
and I just got into a fight with
Professor McGonagall about Jane Austen.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.346
You know, it's interesting
that you should bring that up.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.265
You know what J.K. Rowling said?

19:17.365 --> 19:19.308
"Where did I put
that last billion dollars?"

19:20.076 --> 19:22.353
She said that failure was the best
thing that ever happened to her

19:22.453 --> 19:24.146
cos it freed her from the inessential.

19:24.246 --> 19:28.234
It allowed her to concentrate on the
thing that mattered most. Writing.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.487
Maybe the time has come for me to write
that sequel to Paradise Misplaced

19:31.587 --> 19:33.781
that you've been hounding me
for all these years.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.491
Hey, hey. I thought
you weren't interested.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.160
You said the story was over,
and if I remember correctly,

19:38.260 --> 19:40.538
continuing it would be creative suicide.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.332
Yeah, well, that was when I was young
and believed in myself.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.159
So now is the perfect time.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.917
"Flo Bai."

20:31.647 --> 20:36.469
Hello, Flo. Congratulations
and welcome to the screenwriting class.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.719
"Dave Fenman."

20:44.034 --> 20:47.479
You're a good-looking guy, Dave.
Get your own screenwriting class.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.624
Not even close.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.325
Hello. Good morning. I'm Keith Michaels.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.119
Oh, thank you.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.167
Thanks very much. Thanks, yeah.

21:51.727 --> 21:52.712
Thank you.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.255
Well, now...

21:54.814 --> 21:57.466
Since it will be easier for me
to evaluate your material

21:57.566 --> 21:58.801
if I read an entire script,

21:58.901 --> 22:00.636
and you've all turned in 30 pages

22:00.736 --> 22:02.763
and the average screenplay is 120,

22:02.863 --> 22:04.636
that leaves roughly 90 to go.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.977
So if you write three pages a day,
six days a week,

22:08.077 --> 22:09.478
you should all be done in about a month.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.679
Let's meet again then.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.015
Great. Looking forward to it.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.831
Hey. That's the way all classes
should be. Five minutes.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.500
I had no intention of going that long,
I am so sorry.

22:32.200 --> 22:36.505
- So maybe later, do you want to catch up...
- Excuse me. Hi. Do you have a minute?

22:36.803 --> 22:37.798
Holly.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.801
Oh, yes. I work at the Campus Bookstore.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.723
So, Holly, this is Karen.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.184
- Yeah, we've taken some classes together.
- Hi.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.894
So you didn't accept my screenplay

22:49.994 --> 22:52.605
but I was wondering if you could give me
some constructive criticism.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.352
I thought that
I could come during office hours.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.649
Yes. Yes.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.443
- I'll see you later, Mr Michaels.
- Oh, Karen.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.199
Hi. I'm still here.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.784
Yes. Yes, you are.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.577
Well the thing is, Holly...

23:06.677 --> 23:10.831
I'm not entirely sure that I have anything
very helpful to say regarding your screenplay.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.958
- Oh. That bad?
- No, not at all.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.669
It's just that I don't really believe
that writing can be taught.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.631
Oh, interesting position
for a creative writing teacher to take.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.591
But true. You know,
you can't teach talent.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.051
I think most people have talent,

23:22.151 --> 23:23.761
they just haven't been exposed
to the right teachers.

23:23.861 --> 23:24.845
I beg to differ.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.722
You can get me the best music teacher
in the world

23:26.822 --> 23:28.808
and I still wouldn't be able to
write songs like Paul McCartney.

23:28.908 --> 23:29.975
How do you know? Have you tried?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.060
No.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.513
- Do you want to write songs?
- Not at all.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.014
What are we talking about?

23:36.081 --> 23:40.778
About the fact that the most idiotic
thing that anyone has ever said

23:40.878 --> 23:43.280
is that if you just put your mind to it
and believe in yourself,

23:43.380 --> 23:45.032
there is nothing you can't accomplish.

23:46.132 --> 23:49.245
I say that! Does that make me an idiot?

23:49.345 --> 23:51.368
No, no, not you. Other people.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.674
How can I make my script better?

24:04.026 --> 24:06.970
Right, well, it could be more...

24:07.696 --> 24:09.098
Organised.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.346
"More organised" how?

24:12.284 --> 24:14.352
- Structurally.
- Structurally.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.017
Yep.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.565
Yeah. Structurally.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.445
Did you like that part
where she looks in the mirror

24:23.545 --> 24:25.114
and she sees herself as an old woman?

24:25.214 --> 24:27.575
Honestly, I found that
a little heavy-handed.

24:28.035 --> 24:32.955
So did I. Which is why I didn't write it.
You didn't read my screenplay, did you?

24:33.055 --> 24:36.083
No. But I didn't read anyone's screenplay,
don't take it personally.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.293
It's entirely personal.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.753
I worked on it and
I would like to tell this story.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.463
OK. You're in the class.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.086
No. I want you to read my script
and tell me if I have any potential.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.923
All right. I will read your screenplay.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.513
Thanks. I think.

24:50.906 --> 24:51.974
I'll let you eat in peace.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.723
Oh, thank you, thank you.
It's a bit late for that.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.017
Keith.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.856
Dr Lerner.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.238
Interesting wine
and cheese party last night.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.033
I am so sorry.
Honestly, I was nervous meeting everyone

25:09.133 --> 25:11.452
and you combine that
with the free-flowing wine

25:11.552 --> 25:13.871
and it is just a recipe
for Austen-bashing.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.540
Mary's a pretty powerful presence
around here, you know?

25:16.640 --> 25:18.583
She's tenured, she's published.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.036
She's also head of the Ethics Committee

25:21.353 --> 25:23.213
which means
she can make your life miserable.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.587
Even get you fired.

25:26.316 --> 25:29.010
She wants me fired? Already?

25:29.319 --> 25:30.512
She's not happy.

25:30.612 --> 25:33.465
She did use words in her email
to me like "harassment".

25:34.199 --> 25:35.300
That's a very bad word.

25:35.576 --> 25:38.054
Yes, it is indeed. Here, walk with me.

25:38.787 --> 25:43.192
Listen, I know you're a big Hollywood guy,
obviously you don't need this job.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.986
Well, I wouldn't want to
let the students down, you know.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.986
Well, then I'm afraid you're going
to have to kiss her svelte ass.

25:50.591 --> 25:51.867
That sounds difficult.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.320
I couldn't do it.
And I was in Desert Storm.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.957
Should I bring her a gift
of appeasement, you know?

25:58.057 --> 25:59.329
What does she like?

25:59.641 --> 26:01.038
Jane Austen.

26:34.843 --> 26:38.322
And the award for Best
Original Screenplay goes to...

26:39.431 --> 26:42.459
Keith Michaels for Paradise Misplaced.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.164
This is...

26:47.689 --> 26:51.176
Well, it's tragic
how much I'm enjoying getting this.

26:54.154 --> 26:57.303
And it's with tremendous ill-grace,

26:58.033 --> 27:02.513
that I grudgingly acknowledge
the contribution of a few other people.

27:04.373 --> 27:09.320
Our brilliant director, Niles Kelling,
my very loud agent, Ellen Klein.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.608
My beautiful wife, Tina,
who, frankly, could do much better.

27:14.424 --> 27:18.037
And our son, Alex,
who I can honestly say

27:18.137 --> 27:21.040
is the only thing
I've ever had a hand in producing

27:21.140 --> 27:23.375
not desperately in need of a rewrite.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.703
So, cheers, Alex, and go to bed.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.586
Thank you.

28:21.325 --> 28:25.145
I'm not interested in your feelings
about Persuasion, Miss Stein-Rosen,

28:25.245 --> 28:26.605
or anything else for that matter.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.858
I am interested in a
well-thought out analysis

28:29.958 --> 28:34.696
corroborated with evidence from the text
and only the text. Not Wikipedia.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.782
That's what I thought I was doing.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.325
What you thought
you were doing is irrelevant.

28:38.425 --> 28:42.905
What you have done or in this case,
not done, is what counts.

28:43.305 --> 28:44.998
Can I do some kind of extra credit?

28:45.098 --> 28:46.916
Like Habitat for Humanity?

28:48.227 --> 28:49.328
Who is it?

28:52.272 --> 28:54.383
Hello. Am I interrupting?

28:54.483 --> 28:56.510
I'm having office hours, Mr Michaels.

28:56.610 --> 28:57.886
Oh, OK.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.556
Hi, Mr Michaels.
I'm in your screenwriting class.

29:00.656 --> 29:01.890
Andrea Stein-Rosen.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.934
Oh, yes, yes. Andrea.

29:04.034 --> 29:06.645
Great Neck High School.
Likes Adele and Pinkberry.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.846
Yeah.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.439
I can come back.

29:09.539 --> 29:12.108
Oh, no, I think we're done.
Right? Are we done?

29:12.251 --> 29:13.523
Ten minutes ago.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.276
Nice to see you.

29:18.674 --> 29:19.783
Good morning.

29:22.135 --> 29:25.747
It could be said that we got off to a
poor start at the wine and cheese event.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.290
"We" did?

29:27.724 --> 29:28.959
I did. I did.

29:29.059 --> 29:31.211
Bit too much wine,
not quite enough cheese.

29:31.311 --> 29:34.790
Which is why I brought these
few small peace offerings.

29:35.148 --> 29:38.218
These are DVDs of every
Jane Austen novel

29:38.318 --> 29:41.221
including my favourite,
Clueless with Alicia Silverstone.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.472
What is Clueless?

29:42.572 --> 29:44.433
Oh, I think you'll like it.
It's based on Emma.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.977
Bit hit. Spun off into
a mildly successful series.

29:47.077 --> 29:52.608
Also, a gift certificate from Amazon
covering all the following items.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.812
My personal favourite is
the "What Would Jane Do?" tote bag.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.315
Mr Michaels...

29:59.840 --> 30:00.941
Thank you.

30:01.967 --> 30:05.329
This is the finest public university
in the Northeast.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.455
Yes. I understand.

30:06.555 --> 30:10.000
We expect a degree of professionalism
even from a non-professional.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.210
Yes, of course.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.421
Which means that you
behave at faculty events.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.632
You read the material
that has been submitted to you.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.092
You do not dismiss your
class for a month.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.420
- Oh.
- Yes, I heard about that.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.973
But I want to be fair,
and act without pride or prejudice,

30:25.073 --> 30:26.266
if you'll forgive the reference...

30:26.366 --> 30:28.644
No, I very much enjoyed it. It was good.

30:28.744 --> 30:32.314
So I'll give you one more opportunity
to conduct yourself like a teacher.

30:32.414 --> 30:35.393
Absolutely. I will watch
Dead Poets Society to prepare.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.112
It's a film. It's about teaching...

30:39.212 --> 30:41.861
I'll get to it right after... Clueless.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.200
- Clueless? Great.
- Yes.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.464
Good afternoon.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.351
- Oh, Mr Michaels.
- Please, call me Keith.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.520
Sorry, my youngest was
throwing up all night.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.393
Oh, had she been drinking?

31:13.914 --> 31:17.063
She's nine. But maybe,
I'm a really permissive mother.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.528
How can I help you?

31:19.628 --> 31:21.655
Well, by thanking me
for reading your script.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.699
- Really?
- You want to test me?

31:23.799 --> 31:25.242
It is called Local Girl,

31:25.342 --> 31:28.537
and it is about a perky
Binghamton lass called Peggy,

31:28.929 --> 31:32.874
who dreams big dreams about being a dancer
and is attracted to the wrong boys

31:32.974 --> 31:34.710
and her father is a police officer

31:34.810 --> 31:37.337
and her mother is a beautician
and opera singer.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.756
Wow, you really did read it.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.630
So, what did you think?

31:43.026 --> 31:46.013
I think that
your characters are quite interesting,

31:46.113 --> 31:48.307
but that it's a little
randomly structured.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.643
Anyway, I have sent an email telling everyone
that we have class today

31:51.743 --> 31:52.969
and I would like you to attend.

31:54.756 --> 31:55.605
Great.

31:56.206 --> 31:57.478
Congratulations.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.985
I just have a question.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.320
I would expect no less.

32:01.420 --> 32:05.696
If you don't believe writing can be taught,
what are we going to be doing in class?

32:06.299 --> 32:07.867
Well, we're going to...

32:25.574 --> 32:27.061
So...

32:29.614 --> 32:32.351
Why don't we deal with attendance,
you know?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.770
Get that out of the way.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.941
Rachel Anslow.
Now am I pronouncing that right?

32:40.041 --> 32:42.189
Is that "Ans-low" or is it "An-slow"?

32:42.669 --> 32:43.770
"Ans-low."

32:44.171 --> 32:46.615
- Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
- "Ans-low!"

32:46.715 --> 32:49.159
OK. OK, OK. That's fine. Tick.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.036
And another tricky one.
Flo Bai? Or should I say "bay", "bai"?

32:55.515 --> 32:57.459
It's "bay". But I could go either way.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.286
Good. I appreciate your flexibility.

32:59.561 --> 33:03.837
Could be either, or indeed, "eye-ther".

33:04.566 --> 33:05.838
Let's call the whole thing off.

33:06.359 --> 33:09.971
I'm sorry, Miss Stein-Rosen,
but you will have to wait for the "S's".

33:10.071 --> 33:12.891
Or is it the "R's"?
Interesting question.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.727
I was just going to say,
I think everyone is here.

33:15.827 --> 33:20.023
There were 10 of us last time,
there's 10 today, plus...

33:20.332 --> 33:21.650
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

33:21.750 --> 33:25.070
Everyone, welcome the new student
to our class. Holly Carpenter.

33:25.879 --> 33:28.232
Holly, perhaps you'd like to tell us
a little bit about yourself.

33:28.590 --> 33:31.318
No, I'm good, good.
Thanks, thanks for asking.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.115
I see.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.542
So, the consensus is that
we're all here, yeah?

33:38.642 --> 33:39.668
Yeah.

33:39.768 --> 33:42.838
All right, all right, if you think so.
Seems a little rash to me, but...

33:49.611 --> 33:50.804
Mr Michaels?

33:50.904 --> 33:53.682
Maybe you could tell us
a little bit about

33:53.782 --> 33:57.853
why you decided to come
to Binghamton and teach?

33:58.912 --> 34:01.435
I certainly could, Miss Carpenter.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.143
The truth is that...

34:05.502 --> 34:06.603
I...

34:09.547 --> 34:13.248
The truth is that I'm going
to be writing a movie

34:13.301 --> 34:15.949
about a teacher
and this is all research.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.364
Who's going to be in it?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.666
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.493
You know, Matt hasn't committed yet...

34:21.810 --> 34:24.129
Matt Damon? Oh, my God!

34:24.271 --> 34:25.547
- Oh, my God!
- I did not say that, no.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.007
No, the point is that, you know,

34:27.107 --> 34:30.427
I have to learn who
my protagonist really...

34:30.527 --> 34:32.550
Protagonist, protagonist, protagonist.

34:32.862 --> 34:37.559
Pro-tag-on-nist

34:37.659 --> 34:38.976
is all about, you know,

34:39.077 --> 34:43.181
what he aspires to be,
what goal he wishes to achieve.

34:44.165 --> 34:47.438
You mean like how in A New Hope,
Luke wants to become a Jedi Knight?

34:47.835 --> 34:49.196
Yeah, perfect example, Mr...

34:49.295 --> 34:50.906
Frazier. Billy Frazier.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.449
Yeah. Billy, good, yes.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.702
A goal has been established and
the story consists of trying to overcome

34:55.802 --> 34:57.324
the obstacles in the way of that goal.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.583
Feel free to write that down.

35:02.309 --> 35:05.420
And, I bet that if you all thought
of your favourite movie

35:05.520 --> 35:09.625
you could identify the hero or heroine
and what their goal was.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.010
Dirty Dancing.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.679
Are you serious?
That's not even a movie.

35:14.779 --> 35:18.225
It's a wack Cinderella fantasy
that's totally devoid of reality.

35:21.536 --> 35:22.604
Just excuse me one second.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.564
You know, Hollywood never rests.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.766
- Yeah, hi.
- Hey. Are you OK?

35:27.208 --> 35:29.027
You sounded like you were going to kill
yourself last night.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.279
I was, but it was
far too cold and rainy.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.323
Listen, I am actually
teaching at the moment.

35:33.423 --> 35:36.076
OK, good, good.
Well, I'm just checking in.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.161
You hang in there
and I'll talk to you soon, OK?

35:38.261 --> 35:40.247
Yeah, I will do, will do.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.957
And just one other thing.

35:43.183 --> 35:45.460
Tell them if Matt wants a meeting
he's going to have to come here.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.962
Matt? Who is Matt?

35:47.062 --> 35:48.964
Because, you know, there's always Ryan.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.341
Gosling or Reynolds?

35:51.441 --> 35:54.094
- OK. Talk to you soon. Yeah, ciao.
- Ciao.

35:54.194 --> 35:56.922
I'm so sorry about that.
They never leave me alone.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.432
So, any other favourite movies?

36:12.045 --> 36:13.146
Hey.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.448
You made it through. Sort of.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.326
I couldn't have done it without
your probing and annoying question.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.698
I'm always here for you.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.534
Mr Ronson.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.162
Your pages were excellent.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.377
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.149
Thanks, Mr Michaels.

36:29.648 --> 36:30.626
- Sorry.
- Oh!

36:31.940 --> 36:33.883
I think I might be coming down
with something.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.960
Do you have any idea
where you might be going with the story?

36:37.404 --> 36:39.598
Yes. I have more pages.

36:40.782 --> 36:41.974
All of them, actually.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.219
Sorry, why did you only hand in 30?

36:44.953 --> 36:48.398
That's all they asked for.
I didn't want to impose.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.728
Well, I'd love to see the rest, if and
when you're comfortable sending them.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.105
And assuming you live that long.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.411
Dismissed.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.287
Henry, let go.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.749
It's garbage.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.339
- Evening, Jim.
- Evening.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.514
- Henry, how are you?
- Hey, boy.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.938
You know, Karen,
I want to have a quick chat with Jim

37:29.038 --> 37:32.442
about the correct schedule
for garbage pickups for a moment,

37:32.542 --> 37:36.442
- so why don't you go on in and I'll catch up.
- OK.

37:36.796 --> 37:39.115
OK, don't be too long. You want it hot.

37:39.549 --> 37:40.821
Take care, Professor Harper.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.736
I'll put on some music.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.122
OK, all right, Henry.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.616
Quiet, Henry.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.663
Sorry about Henry here.
I think he's why my wife left me.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.674
Your wife? I didn't realise
you were married.

37:55.774 --> 38:01.888
Yeah. She's with some visiting professor
in the Physics Department.

38:01.988 --> 38:06.476
One of the guys that helped discover
that whole Higgs boson thing.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.144
The glue to the universe.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.517
She's impressed with that kind of stuff.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.648
Listen...

38:16.461 --> 38:17.862
About Karen...

38:17.962 --> 38:19.239
You know, we've been spending
some time together.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.325
Yeah, I think I may have seen that.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.526
Right.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.620
You know, she's been
very welcoming, very friendly.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.997
- Lot of school spirit.
- Right, right.

38:28.097 --> 38:31.292
And she's actually
also taking my course.

38:32.519 --> 38:33.670
OK. I gotcha.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.423
Right. So I was just wondering
if there's any kind of, you know,

38:36.523 --> 38:39.259
university policy or official position
on that kind of thing.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.302
Yeah, it's totally against the rules.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.971
- Is that right?
- Yeah, no, big time.

38:43.071 --> 38:44.969
People get fired for that.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.176
Wow, I didn't realise, so...

38:48.660 --> 38:50.311
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.563
- Thank you very much, Jim.
- Sure.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.522
- Gentlemen.
- Well, hey.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.479
Just coming back from a grocery run.
What are we talking about?

39:01.756 --> 39:06.411
I was just trying to remember
which Shakespeare play, the line

39:06.511 --> 39:09.664
"Tomorrow and tomorrow,
creeps in this petty pace" comes from

39:09.764 --> 39:11.537
and Jim was assisting me.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.668
Macbeth. Act V, Scene V.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.870
- Very impressive, very impressive.
- Wow.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.298
- That is why he's Department Chairman.
- Right.

39:18.398 --> 39:19.674
Actually, I'm Department Chairman

39:19.774 --> 39:21.926
because it pays more
and I have four daughters

39:22.026 --> 39:24.800
who spend so much time at the mall,
the mannequins call them by name.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.515
Wow. So it's just you in the house
with five women?

39:27.615 --> 39:29.809
Yup. Me and the girls.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.777
Well, I'm going to go
and brush up on my classics,

39:38.877 --> 39:40.195
so I will see you gentlemen later.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.031
And, I'm just going to go ahead
and walk my friend here.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.733
"Once more unto the breach".

39:55.810 --> 39:57.583
Thank you. Here you are.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.634
Good timing. Last umbrella.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.761
Yeah, I'm quite excited.
I haven't actually owned one of these

40:04.861 --> 40:06.888
since I left England
about 100 years ago.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.265
But your horrendous weather
has forced my hand.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.226
No, you're looking
at it all the wrong way.

40:11.326 --> 40:14.555
First of all, think about how much
you save in suntan lotion.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.606
Yes, I see that. And sunglasses.

40:16.706 --> 40:17.690
And convertibles.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.193
And bikinis. I'm now very
glad I did not bring mine.

40:20.293 --> 40:21.569
I can lend you one when it gets sunny.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.780
Oh, you're saying there actually
will be a sunny day?

40:23.880 --> 40:27.033
Oh, yeah. It gets sunny,
and it is worth the wait.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.993
The lawn is filled with
Frisbees and guitars.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.913
Professors teach outside
and it's just, you just...

40:32.013 --> 40:36.869
You soak it all in, you absorb it, like the
best scoop of ice cream you ever had.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.415
What a sad, pathetic story.

40:38.853 --> 40:39.838
Too randomly structured?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.256
Bit cliché.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.629
Saying "a bit cliché" is a bit cliché.

40:43.942 --> 40:48.179
Mark Twain said that, "The difference between
the almost right word and the right word

40:48.279 --> 40:50.139
"was the difference between
the lightning bug and lightning."

40:50.239 --> 40:52.225
I love it. This is the
kind of stuff I want to learn.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.102
Yes, and this is exactly
what can't be taught, so...

40:54.202 --> 40:55.562
I know, I know.
No one can learn anything.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.935
It's all set in stone,
let's just all kill ourselves.

40:59.374 --> 41:00.771
This is what I'm talking about.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.323
Late Bloomers.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.118
Looks like one of those Victorian plays
where many people say, "arse".

41:10.218 --> 41:13.663
Well, it is about people who find
their true talents later in life.

41:14.514 --> 41:16.708
Sylvester Stallone,
he was a deli counter attendant.

41:17.475 --> 41:21.087
Rodney Dangerfield gave up selling
aluminium siding to go on to become

41:21.187 --> 41:23.965
- one of the most famous comedians ever.
- Yeah?

41:24.065 --> 41:25.967
Alan Rickman, a fellow countryman,

41:26.067 --> 41:28.303
didn't get a movie role until he was 48.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.638
- Wow.
- Susan Boyle was 46.

41:30.738 --> 41:35.093
Laura Ingalls Wilder didn't write Little
House on the Prairie until she was 65.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.561
Incredible. And look at that.

41:36.661 --> 41:39.014
Jesus didn't give up carpentry
until he was 30.

41:39.247 --> 41:42.021
Yeah, and now he's,
like, a top guy in his field.

41:42.333 --> 41:46.154
The thing is, you see, I would argue
late bloomers may have had talent all along.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.197
It was just unrecognised.
There's a difference.

41:48.548 --> 41:51.197
I disagree. I think
it's just about focusing.

41:51.759 --> 41:52.827
Right.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.867
I wish you'd focused on my umbrella.

41:56.097 --> 41:58.325
Oh, it's a good thing
I don't work on commission.

42:02.437 --> 42:03.629
Hat?

42:04.230 --> 42:05.331
Yes, all right.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.727
Yeah, come in.

42:24.125 --> 42:25.647
Clem, hello.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.781
- Are you all right?
- I noticed this discolouration on my arm.

42:29.881 --> 42:33.485
I thought it was the flesh-eating virus,
but the infirmary says it's just a dry patch.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.070
Well, better luck next time.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.704
But the good news is,

42:36.804 --> 42:39.623
I have now finished
your completed script, and...

42:40.933 --> 42:42.034
It's brilliant.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.211
- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.546
It's unbelievable. It's annoying, actually.
Have you always written?

42:45.646 --> 42:48.049
Pretty much. Especially in high school.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.343
It gave me something to do
in between getting beaten up.

42:50.526 --> 42:53.254
Yeah well, most good writers spend
a lot of their time getting beaten up.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.223
And I'll tell you something wonderful
about Hollywood.

42:55.323 --> 42:56.675
Nerds can rule.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.601
Not that you're a nerd, I mean...

42:58.701 --> 43:01.229
Are you kidding? I aspire to nerd.

43:01.329 --> 43:05.233
OK, so, what I'd like to do
is just give you my few, inane notes

43:05.333 --> 43:08.569
which if you've seen my last few movies,
you will know to ignore

43:08.669 --> 43:11.648
and then, I'd like to
show this to my agent.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.901
Are you kidding? Thank you.

43:18.346 --> 43:21.374
I don't have a Kleenex, but I have this.

43:21.474 --> 43:22.621
It's as good as.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.581
Let's ask the Rabbi what he thinks.

43:25.061 --> 43:27.463
Suddenly, they see Rabbi Stein
eat some food.

43:27.563 --> 43:30.462
Alicia says,
"Oh, no, he's allergic to nuts!"

43:30.691 --> 43:32.839
And the Rabbi grabs for his heart.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.258
End of Act 1.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.348
It's completely contrived.

43:37.448 --> 43:40.927
Your lead character resembles no one
who's ever walked the planet.

43:41.494 --> 43:42.720
She's based on me.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.605
Maybe you need a villain.

43:44.705 --> 43:48.025
He could wear a mask that covers his face.
You could hear his breathing.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.311
I thought it had some
really nice touches.

43:50.545 --> 43:52.192
Me too. I really enjoyed it.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.443
Very quick read.

43:53.548 --> 43:56.576
You start with two pages
describing clouds.

43:56.676 --> 43:58.786
If it was a movie about
a meteorologist, fine,

43:58.886 --> 44:01.489
but it's a story about
a Bat Mitzvah gone wrong.

44:01.597 --> 44:03.415
Ok, Andrea, good.

44:03.599 --> 44:05.542
Let me just ask you
this question. Sit down.

44:06.686 --> 44:07.878
Why did you write this?

44:08.646 --> 44:09.714
- What do you mean?
- Well,

44:09.814 --> 44:12.417
what was the thing that made you
want to write this story?

44:13.568 --> 44:15.170
- I don't know.
- OK.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.346
Your favourite film, Dirty Dancing,
what's that about?

44:17.446 --> 44:19.557
A girl who learns to dance
and falls in love.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.805
Yes. But isn't it about more than that?

44:22.076 --> 44:24.228
Isn't it about a girl named Baby

44:24.328 --> 44:26.773
who discovers that she is in fact
becoming a woman?

44:26.873 --> 44:28.520
Isn't it about lost innocence?

44:28.875 --> 44:30.026
Yes, I guess so.

44:30.126 --> 44:33.321
See, the thing is,
writing a movie is so hard,

44:33.421 --> 44:35.364
it's like jumping into the sea.

44:35.464 --> 44:36.657
And you need a life raft.

44:36.757 --> 44:39.494
And that raft is the impulse
behind the movie.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.163
It's the thing that made you want to
write the story in the first place.

44:42.263 --> 44:45.037
You've got to figure that out
and then cling on for dear life.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.743
So why did you write Paradise Misplaced?

44:48.102 --> 44:51.047
- We don't want to talk about my stuff.
- Yeah, why did you tell that story,

44:51.147 --> 44:52.340
- Mr Michaels?
- How did you come up with that?

44:52.440 --> 44:54.884
- Yeah, what was your life raft?
- Did you have a near-death experience?

44:59.447 --> 45:01.220
Well, it was a...

45:02.366 --> 45:04.844
I used to tell my son stories at night.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.641
You have a son?

45:06.787 --> 45:07.897
Yeah, yeah, Alex.

45:07.997 --> 45:10.024
He's 18 now

45:10.124 --> 45:12.397
and he is a freshman
at Stanford University.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.236
Wow. So, he's really smart.

45:14.629 --> 45:18.199
Well, his mother was quite clever.
Smart enough to divorce me anyway.

45:18.299 --> 45:20.902
But, while we were still together,

45:21.594 --> 45:23.788
my dad died and...

45:23.888 --> 45:25.414
Suddenly Alex, at age five,

45:25.514 --> 45:29.039
became frightened of the dark
and obsessed with death.

45:29.685 --> 45:33.585
So I invented a story
about heaven to comfort him.

45:35.316 --> 45:37.510
He didn't really buy it, you know?

45:37.610 --> 45:40.221
He had so many brilliant
and detailed questions

45:40.321 --> 45:42.719
that I had to refine
my answers every night.

45:44.158 --> 45:48.396
That turned into the story of two angels
who botch a mission to take a soul

45:48.496 --> 45:50.773
to heaven and have to go
to hell to get her back.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.400
Paradise Misplaced.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.726
Yeah, yeah.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.904
It was a fairy tale, you know,

45:57.421 --> 45:59.944
designed to make a five-year-old
boy go to sleep.

46:03.761 --> 46:06.914
And that's the thing, you know.
Just having that idea,

46:07.014 --> 46:09.584
however big or small,
is an enormous help

46:09.684 --> 46:12.754
when you're drifting to sea somewhere
in the middle of your second act.

46:13.354 --> 46:15.506
I mean, let's say, for instance,

46:15.606 --> 46:18.926
that I was going to write a sequel
to Paradise Misplaced.

46:19.026 --> 46:19.969
Are you going to do that?

46:20.069 --> 46:22.096
I ask the question purely academically,

46:22.196 --> 46:24.549
but you know,
what could be the spine to that story?

46:32.456 --> 46:36.360
Well, I always thought Paradise Misplaced
was about second chances

46:36.460 --> 46:39.530
and how it's never too late to redeem
yourself and to start over again.

46:39.630 --> 46:43.075
Interesting, Miss Carpenter,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:43.175 --> 46:45.244
I'm sorry, I just had
an unrelated thought.

46:45.344 --> 46:48.164
- Yeah, Billy?
- Maybe instead of going to Hell this time,

46:48.264 --> 46:49.786
they go into space.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.293
OK, yeah. I think I see
where you're going with that one.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.836
It needs a love story.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.379
It should be in 3-D.

46:55.896 --> 46:57.381
One of the angels
from the original movie

46:57.481 --> 46:59.342
could have been captured
and brought down to Hell

46:59.442 --> 47:01.795
so two younger angels
have to try and get him back.

47:02.194 --> 47:05.639
Jonah Hill. And Channing Tatum.
We know that works.

47:06.574 --> 47:08.351
Good, good, good, good.

47:08.451 --> 47:10.679
Yes. Well, I hope you're
learning something here.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.309
Hey. Hey!

47:16.792 --> 47:19.270
That was an incredible story
you told about your son today.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.698
Yeah. I shouldn't have really
gotten caught up in all that.

47:22.798 --> 47:23.991
No, it was really moving.

47:24.091 --> 47:26.193
I was just surprised
you hadn't mentioned it before.

47:26.761 --> 47:29.489
Hey, let's go someplace and talk.
Really talk.

47:29.972 --> 47:31.832
There's this restaurant called Number 5.

47:31.932 --> 47:34.794
You know, that would be lovely,
but I had not realised

47:34.894 --> 47:37.088
that there's this school policy.

47:37.188 --> 47:38.589
Discouraging teachers and students

47:38.689 --> 47:41.008
from having "romantic and
extracurricular relationships".

47:41.108 --> 47:43.177
- Yeah, exactly.
- But it happens all the time.

47:43.277 --> 47:47.098
I've had relationships with three of
my professors and teaching assistants.

47:48.032 --> 47:49.350
Wow. Three.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.477
And I just think trying to tell adults

47:51.577 --> 47:54.480
what they can or can't do
with their personal lives is ridiculous.

47:54.580 --> 47:57.433
I agree with that, but in our case,

47:58.292 --> 48:00.861
one of us is so much more adult
than the other.

48:00.961 --> 48:03.030
I don't mean emotionally,
because obviously that would be you...

48:03.130 --> 48:04.448
Age is just a number.

48:04.548 --> 48:07.326
I care about who a person is.
And you're an amazing man.

48:07.426 --> 48:09.328
- Well, fair enough...
- Listen to me.

48:09.428 --> 48:10.905
Do you know Steven Spielberg?

48:11.972 --> 48:13.207
Know him? No, not really. We've met.

48:13.307 --> 48:15.459
If you bumped into him in the street,
would he recognise you?

48:15.559 --> 48:18.671
Well, if I bumped into him really hard
and, you know, reintroduced myself

48:18.771 --> 48:20.089
when he was lying on the sidewalk,
I suppose.

48:20.189 --> 48:21.340
What about George Clooney?

48:21.440 --> 48:23.718
We had a lunch.
I pitched him something he really hated.

48:23.818 --> 48:27.513
Do you realise how amazing this is?
These people are the gods of our time.

48:27.822 --> 48:29.473
Yeah, I'm not sure anyone
in the Screen Actors Guild

48:29.573 --> 48:30.890
should really be called a god.

48:31.033 --> 48:33.561
Every society back to
ancient times had gods.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.479
I'm minoring in anthropology.

48:35.579 --> 48:37.064
First it was the stars and the sun,

48:37.164 --> 48:39.859
then the Greeks and Romans
anthropomorphised them.

48:39.959 --> 48:41.444
Then, we had monotheism,

48:41.544 --> 48:44.196
and in today's culture
our gods are celebrities.

48:44.296 --> 48:46.023
And you know them personally.

48:46.215 --> 48:47.908
I suppose that makes me
a kind of demi-god.

48:48.008 --> 48:49.201
Quite a morale-booster.

48:49.301 --> 48:52.913
Besides, what if you meet
your soulmate this way?

48:53.013 --> 48:54.832
What if you meet the person
you're going to marry?

48:54.932 --> 48:56.454
Is that something to be discouraged?

48:59.728 --> 49:00.755
No, I suppose not. No.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.089
Then let's go to dinner.

49:02.189 --> 49:05.051
Unless, you just want it to be about sex.
And I'm fine with that.

49:05.151 --> 49:07.136
Just say that you only
want it to be about sex.

49:07.236 --> 49:09.805
I certainly don't want that.

49:09.905 --> 49:10.931
I...

49:11.031 --> 49:12.808
Let's talk about it at dinner.
That's a good idea.

49:12.908 --> 49:14.100
Great.

49:24.879 --> 49:26.572
Calm down. No one's going to see us

49:26.672 --> 49:27.948
and who cares if they did.

49:28.048 --> 49:30.785
Yup. You're absolutely right.
Silly of me to be worried.

49:30.885 --> 49:33.613
So your son? What is he majoring in?

49:34.096 --> 49:35.743
Well, you know...

49:36.223 --> 49:37.833
I'm not absolutely certain.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.794
Welcome to... Oh.

49:39.894 --> 49:40.961
- Oh, Lord.
- Hi.

49:41.061 --> 49:43.964
- Mr Michaels and Karen.
- Hello, Holly.

49:44.064 --> 49:45.591
Wow, so you work here?

49:45.691 --> 49:48.544
No, I just walk around with a pad
and I find out what people like to eat.

49:49.069 --> 49:51.012
- I'd like the ahi tuna.
- OK.

49:51.572 --> 49:52.556
Excellent choice.

49:52.656 --> 49:54.258
Great. And a glass of Chardonnay.

49:54.575 --> 49:56.803
OK. Just need to see an ID.

49:56.911 --> 49:57.853
Seriously?

49:57.953 --> 49:59.430
That's just restaurant policy.

50:09.548 --> 50:13.494
Oh, I'm sorry. That doesn't look real.

50:13.761 --> 50:14.829
Yes, it is.

50:14.929 --> 50:16.288
I can take it to the manager.

50:16.388 --> 50:18.749
I'll tell you what.
Why don't I order a Chardonnay

50:18.849 --> 50:19.950
and we can share it.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.749
OK. Are we going to get straws?
Am I three years old?

50:23.103 --> 50:24.955
Well, we don't really know,
because your ID is fake.

50:26.148 --> 50:27.249
Sorry.

50:27.942 --> 50:29.885
I'm going to change my order, it's fine.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.300
I'll have a beef enchilada
and a margarita

50:32.613 --> 50:34.841
at Café Mexico with Judy and Chloe.

50:35.407 --> 50:36.508
Karen.

50:37.618 --> 50:38.719
Karen.

50:39.995 --> 50:41.355
Don't make a big thing about this.

50:41.455 --> 50:44.859
She's being totally rude
and it'd be nice if you stood up for me.

50:44.959 --> 50:47.107
Either you take me
seriously or you don't.

50:47.253 --> 50:48.320
No, I do.

50:48.420 --> 50:50.698
I just think it's probably her job
to ask that question

50:50.798 --> 50:51.899
- and she...
- Good night.

50:56.428 --> 50:57.871
Daughters.

51:02.977 --> 51:07.048
It might have been real,
we just have to check.

51:07.481 --> 51:09.254
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:12.987 --> 51:15.764
So, the ahi tuna actually
sounded delicious.

51:15.864 --> 51:17.892
And I will have a glass of Chardonnay.

51:17.992 --> 51:19.093
Thank you.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.265
Would you like to see ID?

51:26.125 --> 51:28.728
Hey, I'm driving you home.

51:30.254 --> 51:32.823
Wow, this is a full-service restaurant.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.242
Well, you had two glasses
and you had two at the bar

51:35.342 --> 51:36.952
and if you die, I don't get
to take your course

51:37.052 --> 51:38.454
and it's going to screw up
my whole schedule.

51:38.554 --> 51:40.623
What about my car?

51:40.723 --> 51:42.291
It's a Hyundai.
It'll be there in the morning.

51:51.066 --> 51:53.970
The girls are doing a disco performance.

51:54.570 --> 51:56.513
I'm helping. You know, I used to dance.

51:57.573 --> 52:00.309
No, I know. You danced modern.
It's in your script.

52:00.409 --> 52:02.478
Peggy goes all the way to the big city

52:02.578 --> 52:04.647
to dance before coming back
and marrying Ted,

52:04.747 --> 52:07.942
the hot, but quite thick
minor league baseball player.

52:08.042 --> 52:11.820
I didn't write "big city".
I said "New York".

52:11.920 --> 52:13.822
You think we're all rubes up here?

52:13.922 --> 52:15.783
Very much so, yes, yes, yes.

52:15.883 --> 52:19.286
That true, did you really dance
in an off-Broadway show?

52:19.386 --> 52:21.455
Yes, until I blew my ankle out.

52:22.973 --> 52:25.667
Must have been tough, coming back
here after being in the big...

52:26.226 --> 52:27.461
Manhattan.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.413
Why?

52:30.064 --> 52:31.674
Binghamton rocks.

52:31.774 --> 52:34.343
Oh, I know. I know.

52:38.364 --> 52:40.091
How does it rock?

52:41.325 --> 52:42.677
Gorgeous.

52:42.868 --> 52:46.647
One of the oldest antique carousels
in the United States.

52:46.747 --> 52:48.440
Rod Serling used it as the model

52:48.540 --> 52:51.519
for one of the most famous episodes
of The Twilight Zone ever.

52:52.252 --> 52:53.399
Do you know it?

52:53.754 --> 52:55.781
I was always too scared
to watch The Twilight Zone

52:55.881 --> 52:56.991
because of that music.

52:57.091 --> 52:58.325
You mean...

53:00.052 --> 53:01.453
Yup, that's it. Yup.

53:03.430 --> 53:06.083
You're very good.
You can stop now. Please.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.035
Please, seriously, stop, stop.

53:08.852 --> 53:12.339
It's the story of a middle-aged man
who's lost his way

53:12.439 --> 53:14.717
and goes back in time
to the park he used to play in.

53:14.817 --> 53:16.594
This park.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.888
And, he rides the merry-go-round

53:19.446 --> 53:21.098
and he sees his father
and his father tells him

53:21.198 --> 53:22.850
that he has to move on with his life

53:22.950 --> 53:27.021
because he's been looking behind him
and he has to try looking ahead.

53:27.121 --> 53:29.273
All right, well, thank you
for the history lesson.

53:29.373 --> 53:31.191
Folks, closing in a minute.

53:31.291 --> 53:34.395
And thanks for being so
understanding tonight about Karen.

53:35.087 --> 53:36.822
It's not what it seems.

53:36.922 --> 53:39.199
Seems like you're sleeping with her.

53:39.299 --> 53:41.243
Then it is what it seems.

53:41.343 --> 53:43.037
I mean, I realise I shouldn't
be leading her on, but...

53:43.137 --> 53:44.371
- Oh!
- I mean, it takes...

53:44.471 --> 53:47.908
You think it's about you?
It's about her father.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.171
What do you mean, it's about her father?

53:52.271 --> 53:54.840
The whole subtext of her script
is about a young girl

53:54.940 --> 53:57.509
trying to get her distant,
powerful father's love.

53:58.610 --> 54:02.181
You're just a substitute for the attention
she never got from an older male figure.

54:02.281 --> 54:03.515
That's rather disturbing.

54:03.615 --> 54:05.392
What's disturbing is
what does it say about you?

54:05.492 --> 54:08.766
You trying to fill a spiritual vacancy
with alcohol and young women?

54:09.288 --> 54:10.435
Yes.

54:18.338 --> 54:19.564
Well.

54:20.340 --> 54:21.737
Thank you very much.

54:23.051 --> 54:24.277
No problem.

54:28.557 --> 54:30.125
- Good.
- Yes.

54:41.153 --> 54:43.430
That was very nice of you to show me
the sights of Binghamton.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.099
Oh, the sight. That was about it.

54:45.199 --> 54:47.685
Well it was surprisingly lovely and...

54:47.785 --> 54:50.604
You're very easy to talk to even though
you did do most of the talking.

54:50.829 --> 54:52.356
Thank you. I think.

54:52.456 --> 54:54.399
And you look very nice
in your waitress uniform.

54:55.459 --> 54:56.985
But, I've always had a yen for uniforms.

54:57.085 --> 54:58.946
I think Kim Jong-Eun looks pretty sexy.

54:59.446 --> 55:02.265
Well, I am flattered by the competition.

55:05.677 --> 55:06.994
Yeah.

55:08.055 --> 55:09.957
OK. Good night.

55:10.057 --> 55:11.500
Good night.

55:30.244 --> 55:31.645
Character.

55:31.745 --> 55:33.939
Character is everything.

55:34.039 --> 55:36.608
Fortunately, not in life,
but in storytelling.

55:36.708 --> 55:39.486
Make sure that your
characters drive the plot

55:39.586 --> 55:41.188
and not the other way around.

55:43.215 --> 55:45.067
Yes, questions? Anyone else?

55:46.969 --> 55:48.245
Karen, yeah?

55:48.345 --> 55:51.165
I'm just wondering,
given that besides Paradise Misplaced

55:51.265 --> 55:54.126
all your other films were critical
and commercial failures,

55:54.226 --> 55:56.875
why should we take this
or any advice from you?

56:03.443 --> 56:07.047
Well, you shouldn't. Because...

56:08.699 --> 56:12.043
When it comes to writing,
there are no rules, you know?

56:12.143 --> 56:16.690
Except be true to the story you're telling.
Just make it your own unique voice.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.439
So thank you for pointing that out, Karen.
That's very helpful.

56:45.819 --> 56:47.888
Well, I enjoyed your pages, Sara,

56:47.988 --> 56:52.434
but, why is it subtitled
when the film is in English?

56:52.534 --> 56:56.230
To demonstrate the vast gulf between
what we say and what we mean.

56:56.330 --> 56:57.815
No one's ever done that before.

56:57.915 --> 57:00.609
Yeah, I think Woody Allen
did it in Annie Hall.

57:01.668 --> 57:03.153
That was a comedy.

57:03.253 --> 57:04.947
I'm not interested in comedy.

57:05.047 --> 57:07.366
No, no, I do see that. Yes.

57:07.466 --> 57:09.910
- Thanks, Mr Michaels.
- Thank you, Rosa.

57:10.010 --> 57:12.746
- Thank you, Mr Michaels.
- Thank you, Andrea, Clem, Billy...

57:12.846 --> 57:14.957
Maya. At last, thank you.

57:15.057 --> 57:18.085
Andrea, this is vastly improved.

57:18.185 --> 57:20.879
Really? I'm going to cry.

57:20.979 --> 57:23.090
No, really, you've done a good job

57:23.190 --> 57:27.594
of foreshadowing by starting the script
with the Bat Mitzvah video,

57:27.694 --> 57:29.346
giving us a hint of the horror to come.

57:29.446 --> 57:34.052
But, I still think maybe you just need
to define the larger theme of your story.

57:35.494 --> 57:38.272
What about the idea that you really
have to do everything yourself?

57:38.372 --> 57:40.520
Because you can never trust caterers.

57:41.249 --> 57:44.695
Yeah. That might be a tad close
to The Hurt Locker.

57:44.795 --> 57:47.364
Did you think you could maybe
dig a little deeper?

57:48.840 --> 57:50.157
I don't think I go that deep.

57:51.051 --> 57:53.153
That's what everybody
keeps telling me anyways.

57:55.097 --> 57:58.167
Well, let's prove everybody wrong.

58:07.109 --> 58:08.760
OK, well here's my thought, Billy,

58:08.860 --> 58:10.762
and I know how much you love Star Wars,

58:10.862 --> 58:13.473
but I'm just not sure it's really going
to pass muster to just

58:13.573 --> 58:16.643
retell those stories
and change some names around.

58:17.202 --> 58:18.186
I didn't.

58:18.286 --> 58:21.640
Well, you have a small, wise,
greenish character called Zoda.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.067
- That's not the same.
- Yes,

58:24.167 --> 58:27.112
but I just think maybe it'd be good
to let go of your obsessions.

58:27.212 --> 58:28.313
Do you have other ideas?

58:29.047 --> 58:32.447
I was thinking about
trying to join a frat.

58:32.592 --> 58:35.866
Well, that would take care
of your social life, I suppose.

58:37.305 --> 58:38.907
Anything we could do, writing-wise?

58:39.725 --> 58:41.327
They're kind of the same thing.

58:42.561 --> 58:45.422
A lot of nights when
I'm sitting home alone,

58:45.522 --> 58:48.546
Star Wars is what I look forward to.

58:48.984 --> 58:52.930
And sometimes I wish it was real
and I could go live in that world.

58:53.030 --> 58:54.507
So, that's what I write about.

58:55.991 --> 58:57.559
It's just that somebody
already wrote it.

58:58.118 --> 59:00.391
Yeah, no, it's bad timing.

59:01.121 --> 59:03.019
So you think I should do the frat thing?

59:03.957 --> 59:06.902
Yeah, why not? Expand your horizons.

59:07.002 --> 59:10.902
Go forth like Luke Skywalker
and find new worlds to conquer.

59:12.966 --> 59:14.201
- Mr Michaels.
- Rosa.

59:14.301 --> 59:15.661
Sorry to bother, but...

59:15.761 --> 59:19.206
That was an awesome class on character
development the other day. Thanks.

59:19.306 --> 59:21.158
Oh, well, my pleasure, Rosa.

59:24.811 --> 59:27.047
You know, I've been
teaching for 25 years,

59:27.147 --> 59:28.464
nobody's ever thanked me.

59:29.274 --> 59:30.509
Thank you.

59:30.609 --> 59:33.178
You're welcome. Ooh, that felt good.

59:33.987 --> 59:37.766
I've been hearing really good buzz
from the kids on your course, Keith.

59:37.866 --> 59:41.228
I know Hollywood is calling, but if you
could stay, we'd love to have you.

59:41.328 --> 59:43.931
Well, I appreciate that,
it's very flattering. Thanks.

59:44.498 --> 59:47.898
I don't think students should
even be allowed to attend these events.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.968
Oh, you look good doing that.
Watch the hair.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:54.301
- Yes, hello, Ellen.
- Hey.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.636
- Got the outline. Looks good.
- Excellent.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:59.639
I think even an agent of your calibre
should be able to sell it.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:03.894
And, I have a script I'd like you to take
a look at by a young man in my class.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:04.978
Oh, yeah?

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.813
Yeah. It's called Veronica, Out of Time

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.858
and it's about a kick-ass girl
who gets sucked into a time machine

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:12.736
and has to fight her way back
through various periods of history.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.988
Imagine The Matrix meets Gossip Girl.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:18.366
- Oh. Hold that. I like that.
- Yeah, me too.

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.660
And if anything happens with it,
I would like to produce.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.080
Email me the pages.
In the meantime, stay out of trouble.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.665
I'm in Binghamton.
What trouble could I get into?

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:26.866
Oh, hang on.

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:30.162
I think I just discovered how the
rhetorical question was invented.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:32.755
- I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.508
Hi.

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.428
I want to discuss our relationship,
if you can call it that.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.139
Well, exactly,
I am not sure that you can,

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:43.642
because if your script
is any kind of guide,

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:46.103
it could be said that any interest
you have in me

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:49.981
is just a misplaced attempt
to earn the attention

01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:52.855
that you never received
from a remote father figure.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:55.900
Jesus.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.072
I mean, I don't mean to offend.

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:00.965
That's unbelievably insightful.

01:02:00.966 --> 01:02:02.990
Well, it was very obvious
to me from your pages.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:04.955
And, can I tell you what I think

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.034
is the most significant problem
with your otherwise very promising script?

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.794
Fine. OK, sure, tell me.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:16.258
All right. So your father character is rich,
narcissistic, selfish, womanising...

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:17.467
Yeah, I know. Too unlikeable.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.636
No, no, no, I loved him. He's fantastic.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.430
You loved him? That's perverse.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.891
Well, he's an incredibly
well-drawn character.

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:27.644
The problem is with the daughter,
she's sort of paper-thin, you know?

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:30.564
She's a good daughter,
she's a good student.

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.399
There's no flaws,
nothing needs to be fixed.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:33.984
So? The father needs to be fixed.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.652
Which is what makes him
an interesting character.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:39.573
And in reaction to that, I think
that maybe the daughter should be...

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:44.953
Libidinous, spoiled, sexually manipulative,
you know, more like...

01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:48.832
So many interesting characters.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:50.784
Like me? You were going to say me.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:54.087
- Not at all.
- You were looking right at me.

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:56.464
I was looking in that direction.

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:58.666
Karen, Karen.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.721
Listen, listen. I did not mean you.
I did not mean you

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:06.308
and I really do think that your script
has enormous potential.

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.768
And I really do think
you should go fuck yourself.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.229
Oh, and bring my weed in.
I left it your house.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:15.025
Because after this relationship,
I really need to get baked.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:22.073
Office hours.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.618
There's nothing like one-on-one time
with a student, is there?

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:25.944
How are you today?

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.626
Hey, are you OK, buddy?

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:35.462
I'm not sure.

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:37.710
Maybe I should go home
and eat the rest of Karen's pot.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.966
I know what you need.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:49.513
Right?

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:50.810
Incredible.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.263
All we need is a good wine
and this is Paris.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:58.689
Well, since my four daughters
and my wife became vegetarians,

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.780
I'm not allowed to have any meat
in the house, so,

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.529
I'm going to get some pork Spiedies
to go and store them in my office.

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:11.164
- That's a little bit sad, isn't it?
- What?

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:14.413
Well, you know,
being henpecked to death like that.

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:18.292
Are you kidding me?
He's the happiest guy I know.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:21.174
At faculty meetings, we bet on how long

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:24.010
it will take him to cry
when he talks about his family.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.837
Twenty-five seconds is the record.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.847
Seriously? Dr Lerner?

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:31.176
I'm telling you. In a perfect world,
I should be that happy.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:37.524
I started seeing this woman, Joan.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:40.193
She's an insurance agent
with State Farm.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:41.736
She specialises in collision.

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:42.946
Don't let her go.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.614
I'm trying not to.

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:47.151
What's the secret?

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:48.702
You're asking me?

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:51.162
I've been divorced for 10 years
and you just caught me in the hall

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:53.206
being severely berated
by an undergraduate.

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:57.081
I don't know, my only thought
is that you be yourself.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.715
- No, that's not going to work.
- No, you're obviously right.

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:04.509
But in an ideal world,
that's what you hope for, isn't it?

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:07.554
That you find someone
you can be yourself with, you know?

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.473
Some smart, funny woman
full of fire and honesty,

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.767
who looks great dancing barefoot

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:15.311
and can obviously
see straight through you.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.100
Why barefoot?

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.644
I enjoy feet.

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:26.071
Hey.

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:29.909
So, Harold, you don't happen to have
any pictures of your family, do you?

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:32.453
Oh, I don't know, maybe. I might.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:36.458
A-ha, Look at that.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:37.917
My wife, Helen.

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:41.880
And that's Kate, Rosalind, Olivia

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.128
and the little one is Beatrice.

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.467
That Beatrice.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.802
She's got a mischievous glint
in her eye, doesn't she?

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.424
Yeah. Unbelievable.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.684
I forgot napkins.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.979
OK, 33 seconds. Solid time.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.485
So, this is funny.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:05.028
It's engaging.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:08.156
My only thing is I'm just a
little confused about Jack,

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:11.284
this conservative, older banker
who is now dating Peggy.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:12.494
Oh, what's wrong with him?

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.621
Well, he's a bit dull
for Peggy, isn't he?

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:18.666
No, Jack's steady.
He's from Peggy's hometown.

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:19.751
He'd be a great stepfather.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:22.295
Yeah, but Peggy doesn't love Jack.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.339
Maybe not, but Peggy can learn to.

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:25.924
Yes, of course,
if Peggy puts her mind to it.

01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:27.175
Stupid of me, yes.

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.177
And, you know,
Jerry's not such a bad egg.

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:30.678
Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.050
Who's Jerry?

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:34.389
Does Jack know about Jerry?

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:37.719
No. Jack is Jerry.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.939
- Jack is Jerry.
- Jack is Jerry.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.108
Oh, so Jerry is a man you are seeing.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.735
Yes. And that's why the character
should work.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.780
Because I'm writing from real life.
I'm writing what I know.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.365
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:51.950
Not at all, no, no. That's absurd.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:55.700
I mean, for a start, what if you're like me,
what if you don't know anything?

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.873
But, you're writing your Matt Damon movie
about being a teacher now

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:01.459
and you wrote about your son
and that worked out.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:04.708
Yeah, that's debatable seeing as we
haven't actually spoken in over a year.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.173
But Jack, or should I say Jerry...

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.171
You haven't spoken
to your son in a year?

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:13.555
Well it's not a big deal, it's just
that after his mother remarried,

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:16.133
we sort of saw less and less
of each other, so...

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:20.061
Cos when you spoke about him in class,
your whole face lit up.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:22.188
Yeah, well, I was very fond of him.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:23.935
And now you're not?

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:32.365
There is no adulation
like Hollywood adulation, you know?

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:36.619
People that you have only seen in magazines
tell you that they love you

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.914
and they want to be your friend.
And it's magical.

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:43.251
Until your next film is not as good
and the one after that even less so.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:47.088
And suddenly,
your confidence is shattered

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:51.418
and your wife leaves you for the man
who directed your one hit.

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:54.842
The guy who directed Paradise Misplaced?

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:56.973
- Niles Kelling.
- Oh, God.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.600
He's big. Hit after hit.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.726
Yeah, thank you very much.

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:02.645
And, as I was drinking a bit too much

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.398
and dating actresses
young enough to believe

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:07.859
that a writer could get them a job,

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:10.778
I sort of stopped calling Alex.

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:15.946
Because you think he feels about you
the way you feel about you?

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.203
Yup, yup, yup.
And really, why wouldn't he?

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:22.540
You know, cos he's with his mother
and stepfather

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.542
flying to Hawaii on a private jet

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:28.542
while Dad is being rejected
for a rewrite of Piranha 3D.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.756
And is not being a great dad anyway.

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:36.095
"As long as you're alive,
you can forgive and be forgiven.

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:38.930
"Once you're dead,
it gets significantly harder."

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:43.603
That's from Paradise Misplaced.
My favourite movie.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.064
One of them anyway. Top five.

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:47.356
Definitely top 10.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.317
I'm very worried about your taste.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:51.814
Top 20.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.276
Call your son.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:56.653
Really?

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.488
Really.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.959
Is it so bad, where you're from?

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.456
I thought so, Pop.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.209
I've been living at a dead run
and I was tired.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.962
And one day I knew
I had to come back here.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:15.760
Had to come back
and get on the merry-go-round

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:19.180
and eat cotton candy
and listen to a band concert.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.134
Had to stop and breathe.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.104
Maybe when you go back, Martin,

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:29.729
you'll find that there are merry-go-rounds
and band concerts where you are.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:32.022
Maybe you haven't been looking
in the right place.

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.688
You've been looking behind you, Martin.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.194
Try looking ahead.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:01.889
Hey, this is Alex.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:03.941
Hello, there.

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:08.938
I'm not sure if you recognise
this voice any more, but...

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:12.525
It's me...

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:16.821
Your father. Wanting to say hi.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:20.195
Wanting to check up on you,
make sure you're OK.

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:22.655
Wanting to say...

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.874
I love you and I miss you...

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:31.836
And, it would be great

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.881
if you had the inclination to call me.

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:37.004
I'm on the same number.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.305
That's probably it.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:45.141
OK. OK. It's your dad.

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.738
- Hey, Keith.
- Hey.

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:04.410
Keith, here's why I texted you.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.664
Professor Weldon claims that
based on what she witnessed,

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:12.752
you have been carrying on "an inappropriate
relationship with a female student."

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:19.175
Now, if you just
go away quietly, it'll be fine.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:22.553
Otherwise, she'll take it to the Ethics
Committee and there will be a hearing.

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:24.721
And would that be a public hearing?

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.934
- Behind closed doors.
- Well, thank God for that.

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:30.262
But they usually
wind up on the Internet.

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.055
What is wrong with that woman?

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:36.200
Weldon? She's elitist,
lonely, miserable...

01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:38.102
And in this case, right.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:43.449
My oldest daughter is going
off to college this fall.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:48.155
And if this happened to her,
I'd come after you. And I'd be armed.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:50.790
I was sort of hoping
you were pro-gun control.

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.494
Well, I was a Marine,
so I could kill you with my bare hands.

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:59.298
A sharp blow to the Adam's apple.
Knuckle heart punch. Malaysian choke hold.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:01.759
I wouldn't, you know,
because I like you.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.803
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.089
But, Keith, you made a mistake here.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.675
Yeah.

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:15.732
Hey, there. Any news on the outline?
It has been a few days.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:16.899
Listen, Keith.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.862
The studio is planning to do
Paradise Misplaced Two.

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:23.861
But, they want those guys
Furman and Lesser to write it.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.328
Why, what...

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.247
Wait, wait, wait. Maybe,

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:35.001
maybe they just want to hire these guys
because they think I'm not interested?

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.794
No, no, no. I told them
that you were interested.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:40.465
But they said they're looking
for a fresh perspective. A new voice...

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:43.176
You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:46.471
But look, you do have a roof over your head
and you have some money coming in...

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:48.347
And you must be teaching
those kids something

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:52.723
because I love that script you sent me
from that boy in your class.

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:57.440
That's good. You should call him.
You should call him and tell him.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.275
You sure that's OK?

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:02.945
Yeah. I'm glad someone's
career is alive.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:07.325
Your career is alive.
It's just, you know, dormant right now.

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:09.202
Just hang in. All right?

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:11.245
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:13.080
Bye.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:42.568
Walt Disney?

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.403
I actually think he is a genius.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:47.740
- I agree.
- I love The Little Mermaid.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.370
The music, the songs, the bubbles?
And Prince Eric was totally hot.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:53.496
Please. Stop.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:55.581
Why do there have to be
all these distinctions?

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.793
Why can't you like 101 Dalmatians
and Reservoir Dogs?

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:01.792
Exactly. Fantastic point, Rosa.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:08.427
Mr Michaels, do you think you can
mention Disney in the same breath

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.639
as Tarantino, Kurosawa or Bergman?

01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:14.433
Well, you just did, Sara. So, yes.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:17.186
- And what's the difference?
- Sorry?

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:21.275
Well, Disney, Kurosawa, they're dead.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:26.400
I mean, great art didn't save them, did it?
They're gone. They're forgotten.

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:29.990
Does anyone still watch Bambi?

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:33.786
Kurosawa. I think most people
would say that's sushi.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:37.411
Bergman. I will give you $100 if anyone
here can name three of his movies.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.251
- Wild Strawberries.
- The Seventh Seal, Persona.

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:42.253
Yeah, well. Apart from you two.

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.631
You know, it all fades.
It all turns to dust.

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:49.218
It's very hard to know why any of you
would want to do this in the first place,

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:52.889
because you will be rewritten,
discarded, fired, forgotten.

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:54.849
That's if you're lucky enough
to work in the first place.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:15:00.980
So don't be under any illusion that this
will bring you immortality. Or happiness.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.683
Perhaps it's better not to even try.

01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:12.233
Try not. Do or do not.
There is no "try".

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.662
Thank you, Billy. Thank you.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:20.332
Excellent shirt, by the way.
I think that may be my favourite so far.

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.550
So one Scotch, and one...

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:34.801
Hi.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:38.851
- Hey.
- Hey. You here for dinner?

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:42.396
- No. No, I had a Spiedie earlier.
- Sorry to hear that.

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:46.484
No. I just wanted to tell you something

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:49.570
and I didn't want you to hear it
in front of the whole class.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.155
Weldon knows about Karen.

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:54.985
She's gonna put me in front of
the Ethics Committee, unless I leave.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:58.329
Whoa.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.539
- What are you going to do?
- I don't think I have a choice.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:04.085
There'd be a hearing, it would inevitably
go public and everyone in LA would know.

01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:07.380
- Not that they care, but then...
- And then your son would find out.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.714
Exactly. Yeah.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.800
Well, do you want to stay?

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.128
- The issue is whether I can stay.
- Yes.

01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:15.471
- First, you gotta go to Weldon.
- And say what?

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:19.058
I've already bought her every Jane Austen
gift short of a "Hello, Mr Darcy" thong.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:22.561
You tell her that you did an incredibly
stupid thing. Which it was.

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:24.772
Yes, yes. I think we've already
covered that ground very well.

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:27.900
And then you tell her that you didn't
know that it was against school rules

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.821
and that she was over 21,
according to her fake ID.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:34.991
- Yes, fair point. Yes.
- And then you tell her how sorry you are.

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:38.369
Do you think that's really going to work with
a woman who practically wears a bonnet?

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:40.287
I think it's worth a shot.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:48.087
Here you are. I'll be right back
for your dinner order.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.635
I think I should just go quietly.

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:59.473
OK. Whatever you want.

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:02.268
I guess that it will give you more time
to work on your Matt Damon movie.

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:06.689
Oh, Lord, no.
Look, there is no Matt Damon movie.

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:10.735
- What? So, all that was just...
- It was a lie. It was a lie.

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:12.862
Yeah. I'm sorry.
There's no movie at all.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:17.450
As a matter of fact, the only reason
I'm here is because I can't get a job.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:19.535
But you do have a job.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:22.121
You mean teaching? Well, yeah.
Number one, I'm no good at it,

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:25.249
and number two,
I don't have it any more, so...

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:27.960
But you don't know that
until you go to Weldon.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.880
Holly, I wish I shared your faith that
if you just push yourself hard enough,

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.548
everything will work out.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:37.720
It's very American, like country music,
or, I don't know, obesity. But it's not true.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.264
You know, it won't make anyone talented,

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:42.558
it won't get me a job,
and it won't make my son call me.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:46.353
I don't understand. Why are you reducing me
to some kind of optimism machine?

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:49.398
You think I wake up in a motivational video?
This is what I believe.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.525
I believe what I believe.
This is what I'm teaching my girls.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.569
Oh, really, and how are you
teaching them that?

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:56.363
By contemplating marrying someone
because he's steady and secure?

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:58.824
I don't understand. So now,
you're giving me parenting advice?

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:01.368
- If you like to dish it out...
- I thought you wanted to talk this through.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:03.496
I don't understand.
What is going on with you?

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:05.869
- Miss? We're ready to order now.
- I'm just saying...

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:09.914
Be right there.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:13.581
Watch it!

01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:21.305
Well, listen. You've got to
get me something. Anything. A rewrite...

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:25.851
I'll work on reality TV
as a writer or a contestant.

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:29.363
Keith, I'm really sorry.
It's hard times out here.

01:18:29.463 --> 01:18:30.523
It's not just you, either. It's...

01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:34.478
Wait a minute. There's some kind of
riot going on. I'll call you back.

01:18:34.752 --> 01:18:36.487
Dude, not cool, man.

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:37.696
Is the party over?

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:41.617
- Mr Michaels.
- Sara, what's all the ruckus?

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:46.038
I don't know. I was coming to the party
and I saw cops and paramedics...

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.207
I wasn't going to drink.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:50.668
Oh, It's fine, Sara.
If anyone needs one, it's you.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:52.378
- All right, people! Clear the way!
- Oh, my God!

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:54.130
- Is he gonna be OK?
- It's Billy.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.549
Excuse me. What's going on?

01:18:56.649 --> 01:19:00.094
Some hazing thing, made him
drink a half a bottle of vodka.

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:03.218
- He'll probably be OK.
- He should join a sorority.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.940
All right, there are easier ways to get out
of finishing your third act, you know.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.942
Mr Michaels.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.493
Hey.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:30.082
Those guys just kept saying
"One more, Obi-Wan, one more."

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:33.627
They didn't want me in the frat.
I'm such an idiot.

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:37.923
No, you are not an idiot, Billy.
You're, you know, you're weird.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:40.501
But half the successful people
in Hollywood are weird.

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:45.764
Talking of which, I was thinking
about your screenplay, and I think

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:50.060
if you love Star Wars, write Star Wars.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.436
But just give it a little twist, you know?
For example, bad version...

01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:59.737
College guy who's obsessed with Star Wars
meets a similarly-obsessed Star Wars girl.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:02.364
Did you ever see a film called Marty?

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.825
OK, I think you could
write a story like that.

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.952
- In fact, I think that could be...
- Billy, honey?

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:08.621
Mom, Dad.

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:11.574
Hi. I'm Keith Michaels.
I'm a teacher. I teach Billy.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:15.127
- And I'll give you your privacy. Yeah?
- Thank you.

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:19.506
- Billy...
- Are you OK?

01:20:19.606 --> 01:20:22.301
- Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.
- I'm so happy you're OK.

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:25.054
You really had your mother worried,
I'll tell you that much.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.847
Sorry about that.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.714
Afternoon. Hello.

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:12.351
So...

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:14.224
Sara told us what you did for Billy.

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:16.105
Oh, I didn't do anything.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.940
The guys at that frat are such jerks.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.314
We're all gonna go visit Billy
this afternoon, if you'd like to come.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:27.404
I would, Rosa. But...
I actually have to leave town today.

01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:30.286
As it turns out, unfortunately...

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:33.490
I am not gonna be able
to finish the rest of this semester.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.500
But...

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.129
I've spoken to Dr Lerner, and Clara Foss,
the renowned poet, will be taking over.

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:41.672
So you'll be in good hands.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.632
Well, what about our screenplays?

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:47.628
I am sorry, not to be able to finish
your third acts with you.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:51.590
And I owe you an apology
for our last meeting. You know...

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:56.808
What I was saying about
writing being meaningless...

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:04.278
In a movie that I wrote
many years ago...

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:08.782
An 11-year-old girl finds herself
an angel in Heaven, and she's...

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:12.536
Understandably bereaved,
missing her family and her friends

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:14.621
and all the life she'll never have.

01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:19.209
But an older angel tells her that 11 is
actually a wonderful age to be in Heaven.

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:24.465
Because at 11, everything you
love and hate really stays true

01:22:24.565 --> 01:22:30.513
while mortal life is a long, losing struggle
not to compromise those feelings.

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:37.269
I think that's a bit the case with writing.
It's our 11-year-old selves saying,

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:40.272
"Yes, that's funny",
or "no, that's stupid".

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:43.692
You know, Sara may come at it from
one direction, Andrea, from another.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.362
But it's real.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.405
And true.

01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:53.786
Anyway, I wanted to say thank you all.

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:57.456
It's been an honour and a privilege.

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.650
I can't wait to see
the Matt Damon movie.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:27.524
Thanks. Yeah. Thank you, Flo.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.864
I really enjoyed your class.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:33.032
Thank you, Rosa. Thanks.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.910
I've really enjoyed the class.

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.998
- She enjoyed the class.
- That was nice. Thank you, Rachel.

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:42.166
And thank you, Maya, for translating.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.912
You helped me find my voice.

01:23:47.064 --> 01:23:48.541
I'll never forgive you.

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:53.170
Here's your rewrite. Read it in hell.

01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:59.351
Mr Michaels...
I don't know how to thank you.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:02.020
Thank you, Clem.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.048
You've made me quite jealous.

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:08.060
Brilliant. Brilliant.

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:11.988
So...

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:15.534
- Now, listen...
- Good luck.

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:17.077
Write.

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:19.079
No, I definitely will. Or email.

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:21.873
I meant a script.
I need something to watch with my girls.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.329
Right.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:26.044
I loved the class.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.997
And you can teach, because I got better.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:32.593
Yeah. Look, just... Sorry.
Hold on, one...

01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:34.340
I have a class.

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:45.898
I meant to tell you never to call again
unless it was good news.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:49.401
Wish granted.
Paragon wants to buy Clem's script.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.695
I spoke to Jenny Glick
and Greg Nathan this morning.

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:54.948
The same people who love me
and are huge, huge fans

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:57.075
and rejected me from the sequel
to my own movie?

01:24:57.175 --> 01:25:00.454
I know. But they love this. And I told
them if they want it, you're producing.

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:01.872
And they said?

01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:03.457
Well, they want David Shore
to executive produce,

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:04.583
but they're going to give you a credit

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.793
and enough money to get you back home.
Greg is...

01:25:07.414 --> 01:25:10.923
I'm sorry. Greg and Jenny are going to
be at a premiere in Manhattan tonight,

01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:13.091
and they want to meet Clem. And you.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:14.968
Get back to LA as soon as you can

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:16.762
so that we can ride this credit,

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.885
set up some meetings. Right? I'll...

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.134
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:25.253
Fantastic.

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:46.917
I hope you have a good trip.

01:25:47.017 --> 01:25:49.044
Thanks. And thanks again for everything.

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:52.005
Well, hold on.
You're not getting away that easy.

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:53.590
Get over here.

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:56.172
Oh, God.

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:48.519
So, Clem, tell us how this happened.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:52.816
There was a screenwriting seminar,
so I submitted some pages.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:54.568
You had already written the whole thing?

01:26:54.668 --> 01:26:57.237
Well, I had a draft
and Mr Michaels asked to see it.

01:26:57.337 --> 01:26:59.364
He brought the script
to a whole other level.

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:03.702
- I'm sure. We love Keith.
- Huge, huge, fans.

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.121
So tell us a little bit about
how this idea came into being.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:08.373
I don't know where the ideas
come from, usually.

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:11.209
And, I wanted to write something fresh,
something different that...

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:13.128
- It is fresh. It is different.
- It's just a fresh voice.

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.796
It's a fresh voice.
And if we can get a Fanning sister...

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.798
- Do they have a young sister?
- Excuse me. Can I get the butter?

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.800
It started a few years ago now,
already, I think.

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:19.968
- Nice.
- Almost three years ago. Yeah.

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.304
So I was watching the History Channel
and there's a special

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:25.682
on the history of the world,
or modern civilisation...

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:29.478
And I was watching it
and I just found it so interesting

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:32.606
how, you know, the natural progression
of things, and how everything just seemed

01:27:32.706 --> 01:27:34.366
to link perfectly together.

01:27:34.466 --> 01:27:36.276
Because we like this story,
we like the protagonist.

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:37.361
A female protagonist?

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:39.237
It's exactly what
we've both been looking...

01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:41.365
- It's exactly what we need.
- It's what the world needs.

01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:43.867
Edgy comedies with
a kick-ass-type woman.

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:46.036
- Huge, huge fans.
- We love Keith.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:48.163
Or into time, sure. Other time periods.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:49.748
- Huge, huge fans.
- Technology.

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:50.874
It's really incredible...

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:52.417
Sorry, guys, excuse me.

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:54.995
Can I have a quick moment with Clem?

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:59.792
- Little story conference?
- Kind of, yeah. Come on. Come here.

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:01.588
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:09.184
You're doing brilliantly.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:12.938
So brilliantly that I am going to leave you
to finish the meeting on your own.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:16.024
What? No, my Imodium
hasn't even completely kicked in.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:18.902
Listen to me. You've probably
missed the last plane.

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:20.404
So I'm gonna give you money for the bus.

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:22.280
No, no, I'm staying
with my parents in the city.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.490
- OK, that's fine...
- Mr Michaels,

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:24.783
I can't go back in there without you.

01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:27.786
Clem, listen to me.
Do not grow a tumour.

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:32.332
They are going to make your movie,
and you'll be feted and rich,

01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:34.660
and surrounded by women.
Can you handle that?

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.379
I don't want to be feted.
And the money would be fine.

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:40.879
- But the only woman I really want is Rosa.
- Rosa from our class?

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:43.927
Really? Good choice. She's gorgeous.

01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:46.179
Not of course that I notice
women of that age.

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:49.015
- Mr Michaels, I don't feel comfortable.
- OK, listen to me.

01:28:49.115 --> 01:28:50.809
A thousand years ago

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:56.357
I was in your position. And you know,
just enjoy it. It's glorious fun.

01:28:57.791 --> 01:29:00.690
And remember, they need you
more than you need them.

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:04.656
This is your ride. It's not mine, OK?

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.497
- Hey, he's back.
- Hey. Thanks.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.249
- Sans glasses.
- Yeah.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.293
You look mighty handsome.

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:17.540
Thank you.

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:21.339
So this is what we're
thinking about, we're discussing this...

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:24.009
We don't want to get ahead of ourselves,
but, franchise.

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:27.588
Yeah. We're really excited about it.
There's actually so much that we can do...

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:33.286
- Hi.
- Keith.

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:35.038
I'm so sorry to bother you
this late. I just...

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:37.666
- I did try to call, but there was no answer.
- That's OK.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:41.962
Just sitting around with the family,
watching Eat Pray Love.

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:45.423
I'll be right back. Go on without me.

01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:46.591
You sure, honey?

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:48.464
Yeah. You can tell me what I missed.

01:30:50.919 --> 01:30:52.264
OK.

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:55.434
Listen, I did not expect
to see you again.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:31:00.522
No, well, I have decided to take my chances
at the hearing, if it's not too late.

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:02.566
Really?

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:04.143
May I ask why?

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:06.611
Yes. I'm not quite sure.

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.780
Well, I'm glad
you've thought it through.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.117
And I was wondering if you could get me
a meeting with Professor Weldon,

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:14.286
cos I'd rather not just
show up at her door.

01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:16.238
- No, I think that would be dangerous.
- Yeah.

01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:19.374
Sure. I can arrange that.

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.459
Thank you. Thank you.

01:31:21.559 --> 01:31:23.795
And I wanted to say
I'm sorry for what happened

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.964
and for putting you
in an awkward position.

01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:29.092
Honey, you've got to see this.

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:32.679
OK, just keep talking
and do not make me go back in there.

01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:35.181
Well, they obviously want to share
the experience with you, you know.

01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:37.309
It must be wonderful
to have a family like that.

01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:39.307
It's a pain.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.147
Every week, movie night.

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:43.481
Yeah.

01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:45.609
- Always a chick flick.
- Yeah.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:48.778
And my daughters usually
bake these sugar cookies.

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:49.946
Oh, yeah.

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:51.698
- Which they will not let me have...
- Yeah.

01:31:51.798 --> 01:31:53.742
Because...

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:56.828
They're concerned about my, cholesterol.

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:02.918
So they give me,

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:04.669
non-fat popcorn.

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:06.755
That's great.

01:32:59.365 --> 01:33:04.141
I was not formally aware that these
relationships were prohibited.

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:07.440
I did almost immediately break it off

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.190
and I deeply regret the entire incident.

01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:22.496
You arrived on campus,

01:33:23.473 --> 01:33:25.246
became inebriated,

01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:29.496
insulted members of the faculty.

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:35.427
You dismissed your class with the intention
of not having them return for a month.

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:39.556
And that class bears a suspicious
resemblance to a beauty pageant.

01:33:39.656 --> 01:33:40.765
Not the men.

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:44.644
Which leads me to wonder if they weren't
assembled for your own viewing pleasure

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:48.314
evidenced by the fact that you carried on an
inappropriate relationship with one of them.

01:33:48.414 --> 01:33:51.943
And even if you were not aware
of our policy on that matter,

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:56.489
it strains credulity that you didn't have
the good sense to know that it was wrong.

01:33:56.589 --> 01:34:01.695
So unless my information is faulty,
this Ethics Hearing is a foregone conclusion.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:07.125
Professor Weldon,
you're entirely correct.

01:34:07.225 --> 01:34:11.129
I behaved unprofessionally
and I can present no good reason

01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:13.548
why you should extend me
the privilege of staying here.

01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:17.969
Except to say, that when I was
at the Binghamton Airport yesterday...

01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:22.057
I was pulled aside by a
charming geriatric TSA officer

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:24.142
who needed to inspect my award.

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:29.397
And she started telling me that her security
post was the perfect setting for a movie,

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:34.652
but she couldn't write because, as she put it,
"Either you're born with it or you're not".

01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:38.072
You see, a few months ago,
I would have agreed with that.

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:42.494
But suddenly, I found myself
explaining the three-act structure

01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:46.956
and the basics of outlining until she had
to go and pat down a suspicious man

01:34:47.056 --> 01:34:48.541
who kept readjusting his shorts.

01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:51.928
And I realised I was
trying to teach her.

01:34:52.806 --> 01:34:56.257
Me, the person who did
nothing but mock teaching

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:59.836
as an absurd profession
practised only by desperate failures.

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:03.264
I mean, obviously not
at the university level.

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:07.014
But it has, as a new friend
told me it might...

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:10.647
Got its hooks into me.

01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:15.652
So, I ask for your leniency,
because I think that,

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:17.529
you know, with a little effort,

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:21.575
I could possibly be quite good at this job
and actually worthy of your esteem.

01:35:22.467 --> 01:35:26.371
And because these kids
have actually reminded me

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:29.324
why I wanted to write
in the first place.

01:35:30.642 --> 01:35:33.628
But, mostly, because I can't bear
the thought of anyone else

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:36.456
getting to help my class
with their third acts.

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:52.522
Mr Michaels, I am not popular.
My students don't like me.

01:35:55.083 --> 01:35:59.438
And it is because
they assume I am an Elinor.

01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:02.448
An Elinor?

01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:04.450
From Sense and Sensibility.

01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:06.578
Oh, yes, yes. That Elinor. Yes.

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:10.707
Prudent, cautious, conservative.
And I do have that side of me.

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:12.834
But there's another side as well.

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:15.253
Well, that's nice. It's always nice
when people have so many sides.

01:36:15.353 --> 01:36:16.671
It's like a Rubik's Cube.

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:18.293
I have a Marianne side.

01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:21.843
- Unpredictable, impetuous...
- Yes.

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:23.678
...irrational sometimes.

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:28.892
You have appealed to that side and I will
indulge it this one last time, because...

01:36:28.992 --> 01:36:32.141
As Miss Austen said...

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:38.610
"Selfishness must always be forgiven, you
know, because there is no hope for a cure."

01:36:39.002 --> 01:36:41.946
Did she say that? That's quite clever.

01:36:42.046 --> 01:36:44.282
Mansfield Park.

01:36:44.382 --> 01:36:46.868
The key to good teaching, Mr Michaels

01:36:46.968 --> 01:36:50.447
is the willingness
to always learn something new.

01:36:51.764 --> 01:36:53.662
I will remember that.

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:56.286
I want you to see something.

01:36:59.439 --> 01:37:00.540
Open it.

01:37:02.734 --> 01:37:05.261
- Screenplay?
- Don't be idiotic. A memoir.

01:37:06.404 --> 01:37:09.807
Based on my experience
of a lifetime teaching literature.

01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:12.310
I'd like an unbiased honest appraisal.

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:14.012
I'd be honoured.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:17.065
But if it were to become a movie,
Meryl Streep should play me.

01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:19.275
Yes, I will read it with that in mind.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:21.277
But don't take it.
That's my personal copy.

01:37:21.377 --> 01:37:23.780
- Sorry.
- I'll email you.

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:26.699
Now, I have to prepare for a class...

01:37:26.799 --> 01:37:27.867
Yes, yes, yes.

01:37:27.967 --> 01:37:30.035
So if you don't mind...

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:32.956
Nice bag.

01:37:33.056 --> 01:37:34.408
- Please leave.
- Yes.

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:39.170
Hello?

01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:40.755
What, you walked out on the meeting?

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.799
I did. How'd it go otherwise?

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:45.301
Well they loved Clem,
and they're making the deal.

01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:48.596
Fantastic. Listen, I will be very happy
to work with him on the script,

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:50.139
but only as his teacher.

01:37:50.239 --> 01:37:52.350
So now you want to stay in Binghamton?

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:54.352
Well, I've been thinking.

01:37:54.452 --> 01:37:57.480
Maybe I will write a screenplay
about a washed-up writer

01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:00.058
who goes to teach
at an out-of-the-way university.

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:03.236
You know what?
That is a great idea for Matt Damon.

01:38:03.336 --> 01:38:05.822
I'm going to call his producing partner,
and I'm going to call you back.

01:38:05.922 --> 01:38:08.283
Excellent. But not between
12:00 and 1:30.

01:38:08.383 --> 01:38:10.827
I have class and will not be
picking up the phone.

01:38:14.097 --> 01:38:15.414
Thanks.

01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:22.918
$16.98.

01:38:26.221 --> 01:38:29.091
Dumb. Buy an umbrella
on the first sunny day.

01:38:29.162 --> 01:38:31.009
- It's raining.
- It's going to clear up.

01:38:31.197 --> 01:38:32.469
I see.

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:37.228
So, it appears that I'm going
to stay here and teach for a bit.

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:41.398
And I would also like to buy this book.

01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:45.107
- $24.95.
- Yeah, complete rip-off. OK, forget the book.

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:49.240
- Will there be anything else?
- Yes.

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:52.618
I don't think you're an
optimism machine.

01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:56.748
I know how hard you work at being a mum
and a student and I'm in awe.

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:59.125
I'm completely in awe. And...

01:38:59.225 --> 01:39:02.837
Although I was only gone for a few hours,
I found myself missing you.

01:39:02.937 --> 01:39:05.715
Now it's quite possible that
if I'd stayed away a few more hours

01:39:05.815 --> 01:39:09.135
I'd have just completely got over that,
but now we'll never know.

01:39:09.235 --> 01:39:13.806
So the answer is yes, I'm hoping
that there will be something else.

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:16.851
Much more else.

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:25.773
Right. Well, then,
I will see you in class.

01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:30.531
But, in looking over my script,

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:33.785
I did see what you meant
about the random structuring.

01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:38.616
And I'm not so sure where the
Jerry character fits in any more.

01:39:39.557 --> 01:39:42.585
Well, that's very encouraging to hear.

01:39:42.685 --> 01:39:44.712
I mean, not for Jerry, obviously.

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:50.339
And it makes me think that if I just try as hard
as I can and really, really believe in myself,

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:53.054
I can make my dreams come true.

01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:56.099
You know, when you say it,
it really does sound ridiculous.

01:39:56.199 --> 01:39:57.333
Maybe it's the accent.

01:39:59.494 --> 01:40:02.473
What? Yes, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

01:40:08.294 --> 01:40:10.154
That can't be right.

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:11.947
Oh, it's right.

01:40:12.715 --> 01:40:15.238
What'd I tell you? Worth the wait.

01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:18.245
OK, I just want you to know...

01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:22.250
I will respect the fact that you are my
student until the end of the semester.

01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:23.952
OK. Thank you.

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:27.255
When is the end of the semester?

01:40:28.248 --> 01:40:29.732
Oh, you'll know.

01:40:44.622 --> 01:40:49.023
No, no, no. Thank you.
Thanks, that's truly...

01:40:49.961 --> 01:40:53.565
Oh, Billy! Yes, welcome back!

01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:57.739
Welcome back, Billy.

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:04.208
And for those of you who were looking
forward to the poetic charms of Clara Foss...

01:41:04.308 --> 01:41:06.251
I apologise. I'm back.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.425
Back from New York,
where if you don't know already.

01:41:12.525 --> 01:41:15.344
Clem has just sold his
first script to Hollywood.

01:41:19.949 --> 01:41:22.768
You deserve it.
Your writing's brilliant.

01:41:22.868 --> 01:41:25.229
I would also like to say that today
we will be taking a look

01:41:25.329 --> 01:41:28.524
at some new and truly exciting pages
from Karen Gabney.

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:34.447
With regard to my premature departure
from our last class...

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:36.900
I'm sorry. The truth is...

01:41:38.676 --> 01:41:40.278
Somewhat complicated.

01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:44.332
Well it's my third act, I suppose,

01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:47.043
and I will let you see it
when I have finished my teacher script.

01:41:47.143 --> 01:41:49.587
And I will want your complete
and honest opinions.

01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:51.631
Though I will vastly prefer
the people who love it.

01:41:53.649 --> 01:41:57.094
Good, let's get back to work.
I think we were on... Hey, hang on.

01:41:57.194 --> 01:41:58.596
There will be no more of that.

01:41:58.996 --> 01:42:01.949
You have my full attention
from here on in.

01:42:02.992 --> 01:42:04.890
OK, third acts.

01:42:05.536 --> 01:42:08.940
Andrea, tell us what happens during
the dessert phase of the Bat Mitzvah.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:14.445
OK. So they bring the cake out and they
find out that the cake isn't kosher.

01:42:14.545 --> 01:42:17.240
But Alicia's parents start fighting
and accusing each other

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:20.451
of getting the wrong caterer because
there are also pigs in a blanket.

01:42:20.551 --> 01:42:23.746
And Alicia starts crying
because she realises

01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:26.040
that she doesn't care about the cake.

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.626
She just wants her parents to be happy.

01:42:28.726 --> 01:42:32.129
And she insists on doing her Torah
and her Haftarah portions over again

01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:34.377
and it just gets so crazy.

01:42:53.042 --> 01:42:55.194
A-ha! "How dost thou, sweet lord?"

01:42:55.294 --> 01:43:00.741
Keith! You're back!
May I introduce Joan from State Farm.

01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:03.661
Yes. Hello Joan.
He's quite a catch, isn't he?

01:43:03.761 --> 01:43:07.491
He's low-risk, dependable,
limited-liability.

01:43:07.932 --> 01:43:10.585
"Thank Heaven, fasting,
for a good man's love."

01:43:10.685 --> 01:43:13.038
As You Like It. Act III, Scene V.

01:43:14.105 --> 01:43:16.003
It just gets me when he does that.

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:22.513
"Ken's dead. He's dead now.

01:43:22.613 --> 01:43:26.434
"He'll be dead in two hours,
and then he'll be dead forever.

01:43:27.076 --> 01:43:29.979
"TOM: Will you marry me?

01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:32.356
"MAURA: You're thick and stupid.

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:35.693
"You can't see the darkness
that surrounds you.

01:43:35.793 --> 01:43:38.904
"TOM: You make me feel alive.

01:43:39.004 --> 01:43:41.232
"MAURA: That won't last."

01:43:43.175 --> 01:43:47.655
"CAROL: Daddy, I think you should know,
I'm sleeping with your business partner."

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:54.629
The other day, she comes
and climbs up on my lap

01:43:54.729 --> 01:44:00.051
with a book and she says, "Daddy, will you
read me this book in your scary voice?"

01:44:37.146 --> 01:44:38.418
Oh, Sara.

01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:44.212
OK. I admit I never watched it before.

01:44:45.529 --> 01:44:49.133
- But when Johnny lifts her at the end...
- No, I know, it's very moving.

01:44:50.034 --> 01:44:51.826
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

01:44:51.827 --> 01:44:54.305
Yeah, understood. Yeah, 100%.
