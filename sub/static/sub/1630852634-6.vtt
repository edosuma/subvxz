00:11.333 --> 00:12.958
[door opens]

00:19.791 --> 00:21.875
Help them. Please.

00:23.583 --> 00:27.041
[Invoker] The little one has several
broken bones and internal bleeding,

00:27.125 --> 00:28.916
the taller one a punctured lung.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.416
They will both die shortly.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.541
[Davion] Then help.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.625
The Shopkeeper's rules
of commerce obligate me

00:36.708 --> 00:41.208
to offer safety and hospitality
during our… negotiation.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.666
Negotiation? What are you…

00:42.750 --> 00:43.833
Sleep.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.541
[theme music]

01:42.250 --> 01:43.875
[Fymryn] You let her inside?

01:44.375 --> 01:46.166
It's not so simple.

01:46.666 --> 01:48.375
Make it simple.

01:49.625 --> 01:50.541
[zaps]

01:56.125 --> 01:58.791
[priest] Selemene's moonlight
shines through me.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.791
Luminous and pure.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.291
Repeat.

02:03.875 --> 02:06.041
[Coedwei] Selemene's moonlight
shines through me.

02:06.583 --> 02:08.208
Luminous and pure.

02:09.666 --> 02:15.291
We live our life in her service,
souls sealed in servitude.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.291
Repeat.

02:19.375 --> 02:21.625
[Coedwei]
We live our life in her service,

02:21.708 --> 02:23.916
souls sealed in servitude.

02:24.000 --> 02:24.958
[moans]

02:25.041 --> 02:27.208
[all screaming in pain]

02:33.500 --> 02:34.791
Help.

02:34.875 --> 02:37.125
Help, please.

02:37.208 --> 02:38.750
[soldier groaning]

02:38.833 --> 02:40.416
Raise the alarm!

02:47.833 --> 02:49.166
[injured soldier coughs]

02:49.250 --> 02:50.166
[moaning]

02:52.041 --> 02:53.666
[injured soldier] In the woods.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.208
-Who?
-Coedwei.

02:56.291 --> 02:57.250
How many?

02:57.333 --> 02:59.166
First they took out our mounts.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.333
Made us suffer.

03:01.416 --> 03:02.500
How many?

03:02.583 --> 03:06.125
Couldn't tell. Came from all around.

03:06.208 --> 03:10.416
Wanted to hurt us. Wanted you to see.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.375
[screams]

03:11.458 --> 03:13.125
-[nurse 1] Calm him.
-[nurse 2] Be still.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.708
-[nurse 1] He'll reopen his wounds.
-[nurse 2] He'll be all right.

03:24.750 --> 03:27.291
Mirana? Marci?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.875
She probably isn't going
to shout back, is she?

03:40.166 --> 03:42.416
[grunts]
What in the hells…

03:42.500 --> 03:45.041
It can be unnerving the first time.

03:45.541 --> 03:46.541
My friends?

03:46.625 --> 03:49.166
In a healing sleep. Safe.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.958
Thank you. Truly.

03:52.541 --> 03:56.916
Now, if you've come to my tower,
you've come with a purpose.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.750
The gem.

03:59.250 --> 04:05.083
Not mine, theirs. I came to ask
about demons. Terrorblade.

04:05.166 --> 04:06.166
Curious.

04:06.750 --> 04:10.666
The injuries your friends sustained
were of dragon origin.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.666
Yeah. The dragon that did it…

04:15.250 --> 04:16.375
is me.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.208
[Luna] May your moon always be full.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.875
The village elder you were wanting to see.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.500
The Legion did this.

04:29.583 --> 04:30.833
Legion?

04:30.916 --> 04:33.125
There is no Legion.

04:33.625 --> 04:37.500
There are only angry people
who want you to leave.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.541
Don't play stupid with me.

04:39.625 --> 04:41.833
If I have to find them myself,
you won't like it.

04:42.958 --> 04:46.083
My pod. My family.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.583
You're asking me to betray them.

04:48.666 --> 04:50.583
I'm asking you to save them.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.916
The Coedwei have a saying.

04:53.416 --> 04:56.750
Those that go into the forest
looking for trouble…

04:57.666 --> 04:59.750
always find it.

05:01.666 --> 05:03.583
[village elder] The Shadow Terrace.

05:04.708 --> 05:07.333
Even Coedwei hesitate to enter it.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.041
We're not Coedwei.

05:25.916 --> 05:26.750
[grunts]

05:29.541 --> 05:31.416
You're leading us in circles.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.041
I'm leading you where I think they are,
not where I know they are.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.291
[soldier grunts]

05:43.375 --> 05:44.750
Wait! No!

05:44.833 --> 05:45.666
Shields!

05:50.791 --> 05:51.916
[Dark Moon soldiers grunt]

05:52.000 --> 05:53.166
[arrows whooshing]

05:53.250 --> 05:54.583
[Dark Moon soldiers moan]

05:57.500 --> 05:58.666
[elder grunts]

06:00.333 --> 06:01.833
[Luna] The elder…

06:06.041 --> 06:07.125
[zaps]

06:13.625 --> 06:15.875
[low growl]

06:21.375 --> 06:23.125
[yelling]

06:24.291 --> 06:26.125
-[grunts]
-[groans]

06:28.458 --> 06:29.708
Fall back!

06:30.750 --> 06:31.958
[Dark Moon soldiers groan]

06:36.583 --> 06:38.291
[grunts]

06:41.750 --> 06:42.583
[Luna grunts]

06:50.500 --> 06:51.958
[moans, grunts]

06:57.291 --> 06:59.083
[Dark Moon soldiers groaning]

07:01.666 --> 07:04.708
Form up! We're going back in.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.166
[soldier 1] Look.

07:24.291 --> 07:25.500
Up there.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.291
[ominous music]

07:37.291 --> 07:38.750
[soldier 2] What's it say?

07:39.916 --> 07:41.166
"Traitor."

07:43.208 --> 07:46.166
[Invoker] You imagine
your enemies are animals.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.458
This is a mistake.

07:48.041 --> 07:52.791
The realm we inhabit rests between
the seven heavens and seven hells.

07:53.458 --> 07:56.208
At each moment,
each of these realms fracture

07:56.291 --> 07:59.041
into an infinite number
of different realities.

07:59.666 --> 08:03.875
Supporting all of this
are the eight pillars of creation,

08:04.375 --> 08:09.125
the four elements
and the four fundamental forces.

08:09.708 --> 08:12.916
These pillars are the souls
of the eldwyrms.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.833
Dragons.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.208
I devoted my life to killing them.

08:25.291 --> 08:30.083
With these souls, Terrorblade can
remake the world in his image.

08:30.166 --> 08:33.000
Bend it to his own horrifying desires.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.333
Slyrak.

08:35.291 --> 08:36.625
He chose me.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.166
Why?

08:38.250 --> 08:39.250
Unknowable.

08:39.750 --> 08:43.208
As long as he is part of you,
he remains undetectable.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.125
This will not last.

08:45.208 --> 08:47.250
You mean Terrorblade will find him.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.708
He'll find me.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.583
-Us.
-Worse.

08:54.458 --> 08:58.916
I've imbued this with a binding spell.
It will prevent transformation.

08:59.416 --> 09:03.833
But the end is inevitable.
Soon Slyrak will go mad.

09:03.916 --> 09:09.333
When he does, an insane,
angry eldwyrm will be loosed on the world.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.208
-And how do I stop him?
-[Invoker] You don't.

09:12.291 --> 09:13.958
This process is killing you.

09:14.041 --> 09:18.083
When the time comes, you will be dead.

09:20.291 --> 09:23.625
[Fymryn] In the stories,
you would appear to the faithful.

09:24.416 --> 09:29.375
And I always wished…
No, knew you would appear to me.

09:29.458 --> 09:33.166
I risked it all.
But the stories, they aren't even true.

09:33.666 --> 09:37.250
Everything, everyone I love. Gone.

09:37.333 --> 09:40.000
For nothing. For no one.

09:40.583 --> 09:45.375
All I want now is to kill her.
That woman, that human.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.166
I know this isn't what you want.

09:48.666 --> 09:50.125
I'm so alone.

09:50.875 --> 09:55.333
Mene, please, give me a sign. Please.

10:12.666 --> 10:14.875
[Luna] I'm lost, Selemene.

10:14.958 --> 10:17.875
For years, I've lived in the light,
but now…

10:18.541 --> 10:19.625
[sighs]

10:19.708 --> 10:23.041
All I can think about is killing them.

10:23.125 --> 10:26.916
Burning their fields,
their families, their flesh.

10:27.875 --> 10:31.375
But it's more. Their blood. Their pain. I…

10:32.416 --> 10:36.958
I crave it. The taste, the smell.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.500
I thought I was stronger.

10:39.583 --> 10:42.958
I swore that once I found you,
that part of me died.

10:44.375 --> 10:48.125
You're afraid there is no light
behind your shadow.

10:48.208 --> 10:51.375
I want to make those traitors pay
in ways that…

10:52.375 --> 10:55.458
-you'd never forgive me.
-That's impossible.

10:56.041 --> 10:59.666
It's not that I don't want to go back
to who and what I was.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.375
It's that I do.

11:01.458 --> 11:06.458
Who you were then, who you are now,
they're one and the same.

11:07.708 --> 11:12.541
I love all of you, Luna.
It's why I chose you,

11:12.625 --> 11:14.208
why I need you.

11:16.083 --> 11:19.583
You will do the things that must be done.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.083
I will never fail you, Goddess.

11:22.166 --> 11:25.250
I am yours. I belong to you.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.000
The Coriel'Tauvi reject your love.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.625
And in rejecting you, they summon me.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.208
[gasps, exhales]

11:38.041 --> 11:39.166
We're…

11:45.625 --> 11:46.833
We're safe.

11:47.583 --> 11:48.791
Alive.

11:50.458 --> 11:53.625
The Sage's tower. We're going home.

11:53.708 --> 11:56.083
I can feel it.
[grunts]

11:58.833 --> 12:00.541
[chuckles excitedly]

12:04.708 --> 12:07.333
-You look better.
-You're wearing pants.

12:08.750 --> 12:09.750
[Mirana] What is it?

12:12.166 --> 12:16.291
Sage. Eternal thanks for your hospitality.

12:16.916 --> 12:20.083
-I am Mirana of--
-I know who you are.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.958
I know why you've come.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.041
But do you?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.041
Hm.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.166
You think you want to return
the lotuses to Selemene.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.416
-You know about the lotuses?
-I told him everything.

12:33.500 --> 12:37.000
-You serve Selemene?
-She is my goddess.

12:37.083 --> 12:40.458
You haven't the faintest idea
whom you serve,

12:41.125 --> 12:43.250
Princess of the Moon.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.666
[Invoker] In her paranoia,

12:49.750 --> 12:55.250
your Goddess believes the prophesied
Elven Legion rises to murder her.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.000
And so she strikes.

12:59.208 --> 13:00.916
Horror follows.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.166
[Mirana] No.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.500
This can't be. None of it.

13:05.583 --> 13:08.541
[Invoker] Selemene reveals her true self.

13:09.041 --> 13:12.291
Her lotuses are gone, her power stolen.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.958
She is afraid.

13:15.041 --> 13:17.000
[Mirana] She helps people.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.916
This is madness.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.000
The brightest lights…

13:22.083 --> 13:23.916
cast the darkest shadows.

13:26.625 --> 13:27.833
[blasts]

13:34.708 --> 13:35.625
[screams]

13:39.875 --> 13:41.125
Run!

13:57.625 --> 13:58.625
[in Elvish]
Attack!

13:58.708 --> 14:00.208
[soldiers yelling]

14:02.375 --> 14:04.041
[fighting grunts]

14:05.833 --> 14:07.458
-[swords clashing]
-[grunting]

14:14.000 --> 14:15.208
[blasts]

14:25.375 --> 14:26.875
[screams]

14:27.791 --> 14:29.125
[moaning]

14:29.208 --> 14:31.208
Your leader. Where?

14:31.291 --> 14:33.666
Burn in the fourth hell!

14:33.750 --> 14:34.708
[screams]

14:37.041 --> 14:42.458
She's in… the canyon.

14:52.875 --> 14:53.958
You.

14:54.041 --> 14:59.125
You're no sage.
You're the Devil of the Moon.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.333
The Invoker.

15:00.916 --> 15:02.625
Ah, you know the stories.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.291
The stories are fiction.

15:04.375 --> 15:05.291
[Mirana] You lie.

15:05.375 --> 15:09.041
You want the apocalypse.
The end of all things, all life.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.583
I only want peace.

15:12.666 --> 15:13.708
Prove it.

15:13.791 --> 15:16.208
I will return the lotuses to you.

15:16.291 --> 15:19.458
On one condition. Take them to Selemene.

15:19.541 --> 15:23.000
Convince her to withdraw
from the enclaves.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.708
Restore things as they are meant to be.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.291
Only fools bargain with devils.

15:28.375 --> 15:33.000
Spend some time. Consider my offer.
What you've seen.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.000
As long as we negotiate, you're safe.

15:35.083 --> 15:39.541
Protected by the Shopkeeper's magic.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.708
[Davion] Bad luck to nurse a bottle alone.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.708
-Then come make my fortunes better.
-There's only one glass.

16:00.750 --> 16:01.750
Cheers.

16:11.541 --> 16:13.916
[Mirana] I met her when I was 13.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.958
For ten years, everything was perfect.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.583
Selemene protected me.
Fixed broken things.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.958
Until I failed her.

16:27.166 --> 16:33.291
But looking into those pools,
seeing the madness, the atrocities…

16:34.000 --> 16:35.458
I was back in that cave.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.833
Walking towards the darkness.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.083
If I were still the Princess of the Moon…

16:42.583 --> 16:43.916
This violence?

16:45.041 --> 16:46.166
It's not who we are.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.791
[Davion] We don't always know
who we really are.

16:50.291 --> 16:53.791
Maybe this guy isn't the devil
your stories make him out to be.

16:53.875 --> 16:57.666
Maybe he really does just want
to make everything how it was.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.083
Afraid of what happens if he can't.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.708
Maybe I'm just a scared little girl
trying to run home.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.041
You? No.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.666
You took down an eldwyrm.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.750
All I did was survive.

17:11.833 --> 17:14.416
Making you one of the few people
who ever has.

17:14.916 --> 17:17.083
You might actually make
a good Dragon Knight.

17:17.958 --> 17:21.500
And I've seen you in, what,
five outfits now?

17:21.583 --> 17:23.708
Maybe you'd make a good princess.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.375
You'll do the right thing.

17:34.333 --> 17:37.500
Even if you're afraid. You always do.

17:38.083 --> 17:38.958
Are you scared?

17:39.041 --> 17:42.250
Davion the Dragon Knight
isn't afraid of anything.

17:46.541 --> 17:48.250
I'm terrified.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.625
[ominous music]

18:10.666 --> 18:11.708
[Fymryn gasps]

18:12.291 --> 18:15.541
Not even a god would violate
the Shopkeeper's rules.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.625
You offered to return the lotuses.

18:17.708 --> 18:22.208
When you stole the lotuses,
there were consequences.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.125
You speak to me of consequences.

18:24.208 --> 18:27.041
Selemene does not take failure lightly,

18:27.125 --> 18:31.125
and yet Mirana is here,
still pining for her goddess.

18:31.625 --> 18:37.833
All she wants is what you want.
What I have wanted for a thousand years.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.166
-What's been lost.
-What about the lotuses?

18:41.250 --> 18:42.583
You'll just have to trust me.

18:42.666 --> 18:43.916
Trust you?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.416
You're giving them back. After everything.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.833
The Filomena.

18:51.416 --> 18:53.000
My daughter discovered them.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.958
Doubt anything that you like.

18:59.041 --> 19:01.041
But do not doubt my love for her.

19:01.625 --> 19:05.000
Do not think I will ever forget.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.875
[ominous music]

19:09.208 --> 19:10.791
[panting]

19:12.083 --> 19:13.125
[grunts]

19:19.416 --> 19:21.250
I only want your leader.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.833
We are not betrayers,
and we will not stop until…

19:23.916 --> 19:25.250
[in Elvish]
Attack.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.750
-[beast growls]
-[elf screaming]

19:29.625 --> 19:30.791
Enough!

19:31.541 --> 19:34.541
-Your search is for me.
-Your name.

19:35.125 --> 19:37.916
You don't remember me.
[chuckles]

19:38.000 --> 19:42.375
Of course. We were all just bodies to you.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.708
You called yourself a mercenary,
but you were a murderer.

19:46.458 --> 19:47.583
A traitor.

19:48.875 --> 19:51.375
We died for you,
and you turned your back on us.

19:51.916 --> 19:54.375
-Sold us out to the Helio Imperium.
-Liar.

19:54.458 --> 19:57.875
Take any name you like,
worship at whatever shrine you choose,

19:57.958 --> 19:59.875
you're still just
the Scourge of the Plains.

19:59.958 --> 20:04.958
[scoffs]
Go on. Kill me. More will follow.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.291
[grunts]

20:14.541 --> 20:15.708
No.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.000
[Luna] If I kill you, I've made a martyr.

20:19.583 --> 20:23.500
Leave you alive, and, well, the stories…

20:23.583 --> 20:26.500
No one will ever follow you again.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.208
Tell me your terms.

20:44.291 --> 20:47.708
This box is sealed with powerful magic.

20:48.291 --> 20:50.125
Carry it to Coedwig.

20:50.208 --> 20:54.500
If the Dark Moon Order agrees
to leave the enclaves, it will open.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.041
We have a bargain.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.500
We have a bargain.

21:05.041 --> 21:06.791
As for your dragon issue…

21:06.875 --> 21:09.125
Yes. The necklace. Thank you.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.041
Of course.

21:11.750 --> 21:14.916
While they're gone,
we can explore additional remedies.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.833
I'm going with her.
You'll be here when I get back.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.000
I've got to see this one through.

21:21.291 --> 21:25.583
In that case, you'll need new equipment.

21:25.666 --> 21:28.833
If you struggle with your issue again,

21:28.916 --> 21:30.833
your clothing won't be destroyed.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.333
Marci won't be happy about that.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.708
A Coedwen will accompany you
as your guide.

21:38.291 --> 21:39.208
[Invoker] Fymryn.

21:40.375 --> 21:41.208
Fymryn.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.458
Coedwig is dangerous for outsiders.

21:43.541 --> 21:45.250
I'll make sure you get there.

21:45.333 --> 21:46.833
A peaceful resolution.

21:46.916 --> 21:48.416
So you say.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.125
So I hope.

21:53.958 --> 21:57.125
When you are finished,
return the Dragon Knight to me.

22:00.916 --> 22:02.666
I am never far.

22:06.708 --> 22:07.750
[Sagan growls]

22:23.375 --> 22:25.125
Coedwig is yours.

22:25.666 --> 22:29.000
But the Coedwei do not say
my name in their prayers.

22:29.083 --> 22:31.000
They shudder at yours.

22:31.083 --> 22:34.083
Again and again,
I hear "Scourge" on their lips.

22:34.166 --> 22:35.250
In their hearts.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.000
What have you done?

22:37.083 --> 22:40.458
I found their leader.
Shattered their resistance.

22:40.541 --> 22:43.000
[Selemene] By killing anyone
who stood in your way.

22:43.083 --> 22:45.500
You have failed me.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.791
This is what you wanted.

22:47.875 --> 22:50.041
I never told you to commit atrocities.

22:50.125 --> 22:52.458
You told me to burn out the impurities.

22:53.083 --> 22:55.166
Do the things that must be done.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.500
I told you to be the real Luna!

23:01.541 --> 23:03.166
Do not fear.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.625
You have my love.

23:06.625 --> 23:10.333
I'm sure you'll find a way
to earn my forgiveness.

23:16.708 --> 23:18.708
[epic music]

23:33.291 --> 23:35.291
I bring an offer.

23:39.958 --> 23:41.958
[closing theme music]
