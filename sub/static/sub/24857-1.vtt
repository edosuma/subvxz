(typing)

01:28.678 --> 01:31.047
(intense music playing)

01:33.150 --> 01:35.987
(beeping)

01:42.058 --> 01:44.628
(typing)

01:58.175 --> 01:59.609
<i>I know about your work.</i>

02:04.415 --> 02:07.218
(intense music continues)

02:10.687 --> 02:12.523
<i>I know they turned
their back on it.</i>

02:18.828 --> 02:20.863
<i>What if I told you
I had a plan?</i>

02:21.398 --> 02:23.935
<i>A plan to finally see it
come to life.</i>

02:24.567 --> 02:25.669
(typing)

02:29.607 --> 02:31.974
<i>Because I know for a fact
that it's the only thing</i>

02:31.976 --> 02:34.178
<i>powerful enough to stop
what's coming.</i>

02:41.351 --> 02:45.088
(typing)

02:45.488 --> 02:47.757
(music rising to crescendo)

02:49.192 --> 02:50.126
Voice: <i>The end.</i>

02:51.361 --> 02:54.496
Reporter: <i>Joining us today is
astrophysicist Michael Swaford</i>

02:54.498 --> 02:57.665
<i>from MIT's Kavli Institute
for Space Research</i>

02:57.667 --> 03:02.105
<i>to discuss his new book,</i>
In the End There Was Light.

03:02.472 --> 03:04.141
<i>Welcome to the show.</i>

03:04.374 --> 03:07.141
<i>This light you describe as,
"The brightest and most violent</i>

03:07.143 --> 03:09.645
<i>event in our known universe",
is what, exactly?</i>

03:09.845 --> 03:12.782
<i>It's a gamma ray burst
or a GRB.</i>

03:13.149 --> 03:15.284
<i>And you believe, Mr. Swaford,
that this light,</i>

03:15.286 --> 03:18.320
<i>this gamma ray burst is
the last thing that mankind</i>

03:18.322 --> 03:20.889
<i>will see before we are
blown out of existence?</i>

03:20.891 --> 03:22.591
<i>Yes. That's correct.</i>

03:22.893 --> 03:25.429
<i>Where do they come from,
these GRBs,</i>

03:25.595 --> 03:26.996
<i>and how are they made?</i>

03:27.798 --> 03:30.201
<i>When a high mass star
collapses,</i>

03:30.400 --> 03:33.237
<i>gravity crushes its core
into a black hole.</i>

03:33.570 --> 03:37.071
<i>This black hole immediately
begins to devour the dying star</i>

03:37.073 --> 03:38.907
<i>around it at a rate of
1 million</i>

03:38.909 --> 03:40.609
<i>Earth masses per second.</i>

03:40.611 --> 03:42.744
<i>Now that's far too much energy
for the black hole</i>

03:42.746 --> 03:43.880
<i>to consume at once,</i>

03:44.113 --> 03:46.081
<i>so a majority of that energy</i>

03:46.083 --> 03:48.452
<i>is blasted back out
into the universe.</i>

03:48.719 --> 03:51.255
<i>In the form of two narrow beams
of intense radiation.</i>

03:51.454 --> 03:54.825
<i>And you believe, Mr. Swaford,
that there is a dying star</i>

03:54.992 --> 03:58.993
<i>right here in our own
Milky Way Galaxy, AWR104</i>

03:58.995 --> 04:02.696
- <i>that could be a likely GRB candidate?</i>
- <i>Yes, that's right.</i>

04:02.698 --> 04:04.800
<i>And that Earth is
lying directly</i>

04:04.802 --> 04:06.436
<i>in the path
of the beam zone.</i>

04:06.970 --> 04:10.307
<i>We are essentially staring down
the barrel of a gun.</i>

04:16.279 --> 04:18.315
(ominous music playing)

04:37.933 --> 04:40.770
(eerie music playing)

04:58.454 --> 05:01.358
(typing)

05:20.543 --> 05:22.680
(eerie music playing)

08:30.700 --> 08:34.003
- (soft piano music)
- (waves crashing)

08:41.210 --> 08:43.046
(seagulls squawking)

09:22.084 --> 09:25.454
Joe: <i>Hey, you know, I've been
thinking of a couple of names.</i>

09:26.455 --> 09:29.993
Heather: <i>Oh yeah?
Let's hear them.</i> (echoes)

09:31.661 --> 09:35.498
Joe: <i>What about Rhea?
You know, like a ray of light?</i>

09:37.367 --> 09:38.368
Rhea.

09:40.470 --> 09:41.671
Rhea Steadman.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.507
I love it.

09:46.310 --> 09:47.710
<i>What about if it's a boy?</i>

09:48.110 --> 09:49.745
Joe: <i>Oh, that's easy.
Joe Junior.</i>

09:50.446 --> 09:53.247
- Joe: <i>What?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I don't think so.</i>

09:53.249 --> 09:55.017
- (Heather laughing)
- Joe: <i>Yes! Come on.</i>

09:55.551 --> 10:00.020
<i>Uh-uh. Zoe Lorraine, let's go!
S'more time.</i>

10:00.022 --> 10:01.222
Joe: <i>No, no, I got her.</i>

10:01.224 --> 10:03.093
Zoe: Wait, you forgot a prize.

10:03.893 --> 10:05.459
- Joe: A prize?
- Zoe: This one.

10:05.461 --> 10:07.830
It's got magic powers
that make you strong.

10:07.997 --> 10:08.931
Joe: Thank you.

10:09.366 --> 10:11.468
<i>I always wanted magic powers.</i>

10:14.070 --> 10:15.839
Zoe: <i>I spy a secret light!</i>

10:16.006 --> 10:18.942
Joe: <i>I spy a secret light. Okay.</i>

10:19.175 --> 10:21.677
- Is it that one?
- Zoe: No.

10:22.646 --> 10:25.349
- Joe: Is it that one?
- Zoe: You win!

10:25.581 --> 10:27.683
Joe: You know
that's a lighthouse, right?

10:28.518 --> 10:30.252
Check this out.
Watch how it blinks.

10:30.719 --> 10:32.221
One four three.

10:32.789 --> 10:34.190
That stands for...

10:34.491 --> 10:35.392
I.

10:35.925 --> 10:38.561
L. O. V. E.

10:39.963 --> 10:42.031
Y. O. U.

10:42.699 --> 10:43.833
<i>One four three.</i>

10:44.334 --> 10:47.438
- What does that spell?
- Zoe: I love you!

10:51.074 --> 10:53.043
I love you, too, baby girl.

10:59.581 --> 11:02.585
(sirens blaring)

11:53.103 --> 11:54.438
(beeping)

11:59.408 --> 12:03.444
Primary subject:
Joseph Steadman. Forty-five.

12:03.446 --> 12:06.548
DNA analysis concludes
possible match.

12:06.815 --> 12:09.485
- <i>Further testing required.</i>
- Joe: <i>What's up, man?</i>

12:10.753 --> 12:15.459
- (indefinite chatter)
- Joe: <i>Anytime bro.</i>

12:19.762 --> 12:21.230
(beeping)

12:21.598 --> 12:24.067
Control: <i>Undergoing psychiatric
treatment for depression,</i>

12:24.401 --> 12:25.967
<i>suicidal tendencies</i>

12:25.969 --> 12:29.305
<i>and recurring
anger control issues.</i>

12:29.839 --> 12:32.608
And the anger.
Have we maintained control?

12:33.575 --> 12:35.577
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I...

12:35.844 --> 12:38.981
- You remember what happened last time.
- I know. Yes, it's...

12:39.148 --> 12:41.150
That's never gonna happen
again.

12:42.084 --> 12:44.219
I'm doing work. I am, really.

12:44.586 --> 12:46.721
Psychologist: <i>Remember, if it
starts to happen you have to...</i>

12:46.723 --> 12:48.992
Joe: <i>Think with my head before
my heart.</i>

12:49.325 --> 12:50.727
- I know.
- Psychologist: Precisely.

12:51.127 --> 12:54.462
- Precisely.
- You're in control of your emotions.

12:54.464 --> 12:56.499
They're not in control of you.

12:57.967 --> 13:01.438
Control: <i>His condition remains
unstable.</i>

13:04.306 --> 13:06.142
(instrumental music playing)

13:07.743 --> 13:08.811
Zoe Steadman.

13:09.345 --> 13:12.315
<i>Daughter of test subject.
Twenty-five.</i>

13:15.118 --> 13:18.454
<i>Unable to forgive her father
after the mother's death,</i>

13:18.820 --> 13:20.156
<i>when he left.</i>

13:25.261 --> 13:26.996
- Michael: Surprise!
- (gasps)

13:27.196 --> 13:28.530
Michael: <i>I got take-out.</i>

13:29.065 --> 13:30.430
Control: <i>Currently putting
herself through nursing school.</i>

13:30.432 --> 13:31.700
Zoe: I didn't hear you come in.

13:32.134 --> 13:34.501
- Control: <i>She's headstrong...</i>
- Zoe: It's okay.

13:34.503 --> 13:36.770
- Control: <i>...independent and self-sufficient.</i>
- It's my favorite.

13:36.772 --> 13:40.842
A direct contrast to her
younger sister, Rhea Steadman.

13:40.844 --> 13:43.579
<i>Substance abuse.
Started at seventeen.</i>

13:43.847 --> 13:46.950
<i>When she decided to follow
in her father's footsteps.</i>

13:47.150 --> 13:50.486
<i>Zoe's attempts at reaching out
have been met with resistance.</i>

13:50.786 --> 13:53.987
<i>Opiates, I'm afraid, have
twisted her perspective.</i>

13:53.989 --> 13:57.226
(Rhea humming)

14:00.262 --> 14:04.700
(Nico whistling)

14:10.172 --> 14:15.177
Control: <i>Lost would be the best way
to describe her current situation.</i>

14:15.545 --> 14:17.514
Nico: I know you're in there.

14:20.550 --> 14:24.320
Just one more time.
I... I promise.

14:24.686 --> 14:26.355
Rhea: Just don't do this to me.

14:27.291 --> 14:29.358
I told you I'm done
with that shit.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.261
Pretty please?

14:36.700 --> 14:38.535
Nico: I miss your touch, baby.

14:44.574 --> 14:45.976
(door lock clicking)

14:47.944 --> 14:49.413
(door squeaking)

15:05.929 --> 15:07.698
(tense music playing)

15:24.946 --> 15:26.880
Agent: <i>I've got eyes
on Subject B.</i>

15:26.882 --> 15:29.852
<i>She just entered the library
on 2nd Street.</i>

15:30.619 --> 15:33.889
<i>Intercepting
the security camera feed now.</i>

15:34.791 --> 15:36.727
<i>Okay, the image should be up.</i>

15:45.901 --> 15:47.436
Michael: <i>What do we have here?</i>

15:47.737 --> 15:51.040
The Anatomy and Physiology
of Health and Illness.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.009
Oh, sounds like a page-turner.

15:53.608 --> 15:55.045
So are we done here? Can we go?

15:55.377 --> 15:56.747
There's one more.

15:56.979 --> 15:58.348
Michael: <i>Oh, goody.</i>

15:59.515 --> 16:03.253
So, Dr. Apocalypse, I um...

16:03.820 --> 16:06.022
Finally finished it. Your book.

16:07.055 --> 16:10.090
- Oh, good. I'll just be over here...
- (Zoe chuckles)

16:10.092 --> 16:14.061
No, it's just you're...
you're surprisingly chipper

16:14.063 --> 16:16.833
for someone who thinks we're
all gonna get wiped out by...

16:17.467 --> 16:22.303
What'd you call it? A cosmic
beam of concentrated energy?

16:22.305 --> 16:24.174
I'm impressed. That's good.

16:24.741 --> 16:27.177
But you know what?
Uh, I've actually been

16:27.544 --> 16:31.946
doing a lot of thinking lately and
don't tell anybody else about this

16:31.948 --> 16:35.485
but just recently somebody really
inspiring came into my life.

16:35.985 --> 16:40.287
And they kind of changed the way
that I look at things.

16:40.289 --> 16:42.058
- Really? How so?
- Hmm.

16:42.825 --> 16:46.861
Well, I guess you could
say that they convinced me

16:46.863 --> 16:51.667
of the possibility of a more
optimistic future for mankind.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.544
- Oh, shhh. Sorry.
- (Zoe snickers)

17:03.313 --> 17:04.980
- Look! Fate page.
- What?

17:05.248 --> 17:08.351
- What?
- When a book falls like that it's a fate page.

17:08.684 --> 17:10.319
Me and my sister,
we used to play this game.

17:10.686 --> 17:12.453
We kind of just dropped them
on purpose

17:12.454 --> 17:14.023
And see what page
they open up to.

17:14.190 --> 17:16.625
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, wait. Just close your eyes.

17:17.861 --> 17:20.430
- Just do it. Just close your eyes.
- (Michael sighs)

17:21.631 --> 17:23.900
- Okay, so you take your finger.
- Mhm.

17:24.633 --> 17:26.132
- Pick it up.
- Mhm.

17:26.134 --> 17:28.368
You move it kind of around
the page.

17:28.371 --> 17:29.372
- Okay.
- Zoe: Circle it.

17:29.605 --> 17:31.440
And you just drop it down.

17:33.509 --> 17:35.711
Okay, don't move it.
You can open your eyes.

17:36.645 --> 17:37.979
It's kind of like a fortune.

17:38.146 --> 17:40.048
You can see how it applies
to your life.

17:40.615 --> 17:41.785
What does it say?

17:43.084 --> 17:44.353
(clears throat)

17:44.653 --> 17:47.990
During an infection, apoptosis,

17:48.357 --> 17:49.625
whatever the hell that is,

17:49.959 --> 17:52.692
can serve a protective function
by killing off

17:52.694 --> 17:56.932
virus-contaminated cells before they
spill over with virus particles.

17:57.267 --> 18:01.003
This act of self-sacrifice
hampers the spread of infection

18:01.370 --> 18:04.006
and can save the whole organism.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.844
That is completely
not informative.

18:09.078 --> 18:11.213
No, you have to look
past the words.

18:11.613 --> 18:13.149
You know, like...

18:13.682 --> 18:15.850
Like maybe you're the apoptosis

18:15.852 --> 18:19.389
- serving a protective function.
- Oh! Right.

18:19.622 --> 18:21.255
That is such a sound theory.
You know what?

18:21.257 --> 18:23.624
I think I saw the mental health
section back there.

18:23.626 --> 18:25.560
- We should probably just go...
- Okay.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.330
- ...take a gander over there. What do you think?
- Got you.

18:27.663 --> 18:31.267
(indistinct chatter)

18:31.934 --> 18:33.768
Psychologist: And how is
the job-hunt going?

18:34.003 --> 18:37.773
- Any luck?
- I landed a front desk gig

18:37.973 --> 18:40.841
at this
government funded facility.

18:40.843 --> 18:42.810
It's... I don't know
I didn't even apply.

18:42.812 --> 18:46.048
They uh, I don't know, they got
my name, They contacted me and...

18:47.016 --> 18:48.517
Thought it was
kind of weird but...

18:49.250 --> 18:54.590
you know, whatever.
It's good pay and benefits so...

18:54.790 --> 18:58.794
A year sober, a new job,
a new man.

18:59.696 --> 19:00.963
It's all good stuff.

19:01.296 --> 19:03.031
Man: Well, everyone,
this is a special evening.

19:03.364 --> 19:07.036
Joe, come on up here
and get your one-year chip.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.541
(applause)

19:16.278 --> 19:19.848
I guess I should thank my
higher power. Um...

19:20.917 --> 19:25.956
<i>I don't really know who
or whatever that is yet.</i>

19:28.592 --> 19:31.259
I remember when my wife was sick
and uh...

19:32.061 --> 19:35.331
After she died
I prayed all the time.

19:36.399 --> 19:38.367
<i>There was no voice
coming back to me.</i>

19:38.934 --> 19:41.704
<i>There were no answers,
There were no nothing.</i>

19:42.904 --> 19:46.776
And I ended up stranding my kids
out to sea.

19:48.277 --> 19:49.945
I don't blame them
for hating me.

19:50.846 --> 19:52.248
I mean, I'd hate me too.

19:53.215 --> 19:54.150
Uh...

19:55.884 --> 19:57.853
<i>But I got to believe
that in their hearts</i>

19:58.488 --> 20:00.123
<i>they still want their dad.</i>

20:00.922 --> 20:02.157
<i>I don't know.</i>

20:02.392 --> 20:03.727
<i>I can do better.</i>

20:04.727 --> 20:05.929
<i>I can be better.</i>

20:08.530 --> 20:10.267
(ambient music playing)

20:11.901 --> 20:14.168
- Buddy! Hello!
- (Heather giggling)

20:14.170 --> 20:15.937
Heather: Oh,
where are my kisses?

20:15.939 --> 20:19.609
- Good boy! Oh, hello!
- Hi.

20:20.241 --> 20:21.744
Welcome home, Dad!

20:27.115 --> 20:29.449
- Joe: <i>You got a little taller.</i>
- Rhea: <i>Little bit, little bit.</i>

20:29.451 --> 20:30.986
Where's your sister?

20:31.386 --> 20:33.422
- Heather: Oh, she's uh, she's up there.
- Rhea: Oh Dad, you stink.

20:34.356 --> 20:36.925
- What's with this?
- It's for a school project.

20:37.259 --> 20:38.927
You wanna know what it's about
now?

20:38.929 --> 20:40.428
No, no.
Come here and give me a hug.

20:40.430 --> 20:42.196
- Zoe: No, you smell.
- (Rhea laughing)

20:42.198 --> 20:44.230
- Look.
- Zoe: No. (squealing) No!

20:44.232 --> 20:47.002
- Here.
- Zoe: Stop it. (laughing)

20:47.803 --> 20:49.138
Heather: Don't chase your child.

20:49.372 --> 20:51.740
Joe: <i>All right, so what is this
report on?</i>

20:52.240 --> 20:54.073
Zoe: Uh, it's on professions
and I chose yours.

20:54.075 --> 20:55.708
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- Rhea: No, wait, wait!

20:55.710 --> 20:57.412
- Rhea: Wait. Here it is.
- Joe: Abso...

20:57.880 --> 20:59.482
- Zoe: Wait Rhea I was gonna... Just one second.
- Heather: She baked a cake.

20:59.648 --> 21:00.950
Be right with you.

21:01.950 --> 21:03.884
Zoe: <i>Say your name
and your profession.</i>

21:03.886 --> 21:05.852
- <i>You need to say it into the camera.</i>
- Joe: <i>Hi.</i>

21:05.854 --> 21:07.256
<i>My name is Joseph Steadman.</i>

21:07.590 --> 21:10.725
<i>I am a deck hand
on a commercial fishing boat.</i>

21:10.727 --> 21:14.197
Zoe: <i>What do you do in your off-time
when you're... When you're not working?</i>

21:16.198 --> 21:17.200
Uh...

21:19.134 --> 21:20.804
Mostly I think about this.

21:22.304 --> 21:23.373
Being here.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
Being home.

21:26.042 --> 21:27.944
(clears throat)
You know, you guys.

21:44.893 --> 21:46.327
Michael: So I'm just wondering,
like,

21:46.728 --> 21:49.565
at one point you're gonna have
to take, like, a bedpan test?

21:49.966 --> 21:51.465
- Like, do you guys have...
- Do you...

21:51.467 --> 21:53.370
do you really think
that's a real thing?

21:57.006 --> 21:58.908
You need to be pretty
experienced at that.

21:59.075 --> 22:02.978
- I mean, it's a very delicate situation...
- What do you think nursing is?

22:11.319 --> 22:13.288
Michael: ...just dumping them
out there for ya.

22:13.655 --> 22:17.424
Just saying, things that will
make you a better nurse

22:17.426 --> 22:19.395
- at the end of the day.
- Yeah, that's abs...

22:19.661 --> 22:21.063
- Zoe: Oh, shit.
- Michael: What?

22:21.229 --> 22:24.233
- Hey, Zoe.
- Zoe: That's my dad.

22:26.536 --> 22:28.138
I got a year sober today.

22:30.905 --> 22:33.142
I uh, thought maybe
we could uh...

22:34.876 --> 22:37.079
go to dinner, maybe talk.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.115
I got you something.

22:41.784 --> 22:42.951
Am I embarrassing you?

22:43.353 --> 22:45.321
Dad, why don't you go try
this with Rhea?

22:45.688 --> 22:48.922
She needs it. You think coming
here with presents is gonna help?

22:48.924 --> 22:51.094
Okay, no, no, no, listen,
listen, listen. I...

22:52.661 --> 22:55.465
I'm trying. And you know, I...

22:56.065 --> 22:57.432
I can't get through to Rhea.

22:57.933 --> 22:59.301
Not by myself.

23:01.203 --> 23:03.605
Maybe we could, uh,
do it together.

23:04.207 --> 23:06.276
Maybe the three of us
like a family.

23:07.209 --> 23:08.777
Can we just leave? Can we go?

23:08.978 --> 23:10.944
Alright, well I just want you
to have this.

23:10.946 --> 23:13.147
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look, why don't
you just give her some space?

23:13.149 --> 23:15.049
She's obviously just not into it
right now.

23:15.051 --> 23:17.253
- Alright, listen. I just...
- Hey, you are.

23:17.620 --> 23:20.489
- I am what?
- You are embarrassing her.

23:20.890 --> 23:22.989
- (groans) Get your fucking hands off me!
- Zoe: Dad!

23:22.991 --> 23:25.726
- Dad, just stop!
- What's your problem? Christ!

23:25.728 --> 23:28.531
- Stop! Stop!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

23:28.930 --> 23:31.200
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry!

23:31.600 --> 23:33.068
No, it wasn't him, it's you!

23:33.235 --> 23:35.138
It's always you!
It's the same shit!

23:36.572 --> 23:37.841
You're never gonna change.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.077
Zoe. Zoe!

23:44.580 --> 23:45.782
I...

23:47.815 --> 23:50.319
(birds chirping)

24:08.537 --> 24:11.306
(intense music playing)

24:18.380 --> 24:20.816
(phone ringing)

24:24.120 --> 24:25.921
Zoe: <i>Come on, Rhea. Pick up.</i>

24:26.188 --> 24:27.790
<i>I got you that phone
so you would use it.</i>

24:28.090 --> 24:32.328
<i>Okay, please? Sis, I'm here.
Just... Don't forget, okay?</i>

24:35.197 --> 24:37.698
I don't understand.
She was doing so well.

24:37.700 --> 24:40.833
We talked every Sunday for the last
three months. She's using again.

24:40.835 --> 24:44.272
Look, just give her some time, all right?
I know she's gonna call.

24:44.707 --> 24:45.874
You know?

24:46.609 --> 24:49.141
You don't know anything
about me, Michael.

24:49.143 --> 24:50.511
I mean, why are you
even still here?

24:50.513 --> 24:52.580
My dad just punched you
in the face.

24:52.582 --> 24:54.350
No, look. Hey, it's okay.

24:55.517 --> 24:58.020
I'm here because I love you,
all right?

24:59.888 --> 25:03.357
God, you don't wanna get sucked into this.
I'm like a fucking black hole.

25:03.359 --> 25:05.995
No.
You are not a black hole, Zoe.

25:06.527 --> 25:07.528
Your dad is.

25:08.063 --> 25:10.166
And unlike him
I'm not going anywhere.

25:11.467 --> 25:12.535
All right?

25:17.073 --> 25:18.240
It's okay.

25:20.209 --> 25:21.443
It's gonna be okay.

25:32.287 --> 25:34.923
(eerie music playing)

25:43.865 --> 25:47.135
Joe: <i>Rhea. Rhea, it's me.</i>

25:48.069 --> 25:49.271
<i>Uh...</i>

25:50.639 --> 25:55.344
<i>Uh, I fucked up.
Can you call me?</i>

25:56.511 --> 25:57.512
<i>I, uh...</i>

25:59.014 --> 26:02.986
<i>I wanna fix this. Just call me.</i>

26:25.140 --> 26:27.377
(music rising to crescendo)

26:59.607 --> 27:01.510
Heather:
<i>I'm not scared anymore, baby.</i>

27:04.313 --> 27:05.715
<i>I've accepted it.</i>

27:08.450 --> 27:10.420
<i>And I need you to do the same.</i>

27:14.155 --> 27:16.258
You just have to believe
like I do.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.696
Believe you're the man
that I see.

27:24.299 --> 27:26.702
I need you to be strong
for our girls.

27:27.836 --> 27:30.506
And you keep our family
together when I'm gone.

27:33.342 --> 27:37.380
Joe: Don't say that.
You're not going anywhere.

27:39.815 --> 27:41.084
Joe...

27:43.385 --> 27:44.319
Please.

27:46.854 --> 27:48.190
Promise me.

27:51.259 --> 27:52.594
Joe: <i>I promise.</i>

27:56.632 --> 27:58.334
I'm sorry, baby.

28:02.404 --> 28:04.272
I messed everything up.

28:07.543 --> 28:08.710
I lost 'em.

28:46.047 --> 28:48.785
(tense music playing)

28:51.018 --> 28:52.521
(Joe muffled yelling)

28:59.961 --> 29:01.229
(groans)

29:17.912 --> 29:19.614
(eerie music playing)

29:26.054 --> 29:27.190
Control: <i>Gentlemen.</i>

29:28.723 --> 29:31.660
- <i>We are at zero hour.</i>

29:35.863 --> 29:36.832
(beeping)

29:37.199 --> 29:39.134
(ominous music playing)

29:53.315 --> 29:56.184
(beeping)

30:07.563 --> 30:09.363
(high-pitched buzzing)

30:09.565 --> 30:13.169
- (ears ringing)
- (groans)

30:14.268 --> 30:16.037
Open your eyes, Joseph Steadman.

30:16.904 --> 30:18.971
<i>But everybody calls you Joe,
don't they?</i>

30:18.973 --> 30:20.208
(groaning)

30:21.776 --> 30:22.745
What...

30:24.380 --> 30:26.982
When your wife died
you reached out for a God.

30:27.283 --> 30:31.254
But no one answered. (echoes)

30:32.921 --> 30:34.720
You wanted someone
to tell you what to do.

30:34.722 --> 30:37.893
(echoes) To tell you what to do.

30:39.694 --> 30:41.660
Joe: (recording) <i>I remember
when my wife was sick</i>

30:41.662 --> 30:44.400
- <i>And uh... She died.</i>
- (groaning)

30:44.734 --> 30:50.640
<i>I prayed all the time. And uh, there
was no voice coming back to me.</i>

30:52.074 --> 30:54.375
<i>I did not know what to do.</i>

30:55.076 --> 30:57.711
<i>I did not know what to do.</i>

30:58.279 --> 31:00.583
<i>I did not know what to do.</i>

31:01.517 --> 31:04.487
<i>I did not know what to do.</i>

31:14.330 --> 31:17.166
(screaming in agony)

31:17.565 --> 31:19.334
Control: <i>We're transmitting
a data burst</i>

31:20.102 --> 31:22.604
<i>through a device
we placed on your optic nerve.</i>

31:25.440 --> 31:27.241
<i>It allows us to see
what you see.</i>

31:27.843 --> 31:30.746
<i>And you to see
what we want you to.</i>

31:31.212 --> 31:34.416
<i>In this case your drug addict
daughter, Rhea.</i>

31:35.584 --> 31:38.219
<i>Now you see the consequences
of your actions, Joe.</i>

31:38.719 --> 31:40.456
<i>Look at how you influenced her.</i>

31:40.789 --> 31:42.857
<i>She's about to score
her next hit.</i>

31:43.725 --> 31:46.562
<i>I've been watching your family
for some time now, Joe.</i>

31:47.562 --> 31:49.197
(Joe screams in pain)

31:49.797 --> 31:51.997
Control: <i>Why did you give up
so easily?</i>

31:51.999 --> 31:53.568
- Joe: <i>No!</i>
- Control: <i>You're not fixing anything!</i>

31:53.802 --> 31:55.901
- <i>It's broken, all of it.</i>
- Joe: <i>Stop!</i>

31:55.903 --> 31:58.371
<i>Lost because you weren't strong
enough to hold it together.</i>

31:58.373 --> 32:00.340
- Joe: <i>Get out of my head!</i>
- Control: <i>Broken promises, Joe.</i>

32:00.342 --> 32:04.379
<i>Broken family, smashed down
by your unstable hands.</i>

32:04.680 --> 32:07.280
Zoe: <i>It's got magic powers
to keep you strong.</i>

32:07.282 --> 32:09.582
Control: <i>And I can help you
find your strength to put those</i>

32:09.584 --> 32:11.718
- <i>pieces back together.</i>
- Joe: <i>I always wanted magic powers.</i>

32:11.720 --> 32:13.488
Control: <i>But first,
you have to answer me, Joe.</i>

32:13.756 --> 32:15.591
<i>Do you believe in me?</i>

32:16.158 --> 32:17.593
(Joe chuckles)

32:18.227 --> 32:20.296
(screams)

32:24.032 --> 32:27.336
- Come on, honey. Turn it off.
- (groans)

32:32.708 --> 32:34.442
(screaming in agony)

32:41.549 --> 32:43.018
Answer me, Joe.

32:43.986 --> 32:45.488
(groans)

32:48.657 --> 32:50.926
Yes. What do you want?

32:51.258 --> 32:52.493
Sabi: Hello?

32:53.394 --> 32:54.963
- Joe: Help me!
- Sabi: What happened?

32:55.363 --> 32:57.296
I need you to lift that firearm
And shoot this woman in the head.

32:57.298 --> 32:59.698
- Sabi: Are you ok?
- Joe: Call the police. Please!

32:59.700 --> 33:01.670
- Help me! He...
- Sabi: Tell me what happened.

33:02.069 --> 33:04.504
- Control: Now, Joe.
- Joe: I don't know just please help me.

33:04.506 --> 33:05.841
You're gonna be fine.

33:07.109 --> 33:09.109
Control: <i>Or I'm gonna put a
bullet in your daughter's head.</i>

33:09.111 --> 33:11.945
Joe: <i>No! No, please!
Okay, anything.</i>

33:11.947 --> 33:13.949
- Sabi: What?
- Please, don't hurt her.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.285
Control: <i>Then do as I say.
You've got exactly five seconds.</i>

33:16.852 --> 33:18.921
- I can't do this.
- Wait, who are you talking to?

33:19.153 --> 33:20.189
Control: <i>Five.</i>

33:20.756 --> 33:23.425
- Joe: Okay, okay, okay, okay!
- Control: <i>Four.</i>

33:23.991 --> 33:25.759

33:41.576 --> 33:43.844
Joe: (recording) <i>I guess,
I should thank my higher power.</i>

33:44.513 --> 33:50.686
<i>Honestly, I don't really know
who or whatever that is yet.</i>

33:51.487 --> 33:53.122
Remember this, Joe.

33:54.355 --> 33:56.424
I am your higher power.

33:57.459 --> 33:59.762
And you will surrender to me.

34:00.863 --> 34:03.865
- We have big plans for you.

<i>Help!</i>

<i>Oh no!</i>

35:34.855 --> 35:38.026

- Operator: <i>9-1-1.</i>

35:41.495 --> 35:45.566
- <i>What's the nature of your emergency?</i>
- Joe: <i>Yes, I've been kidnapped!</i>

35:45.968 --> 35:48.234
<i>There's a man, he's watching
my daughters and I...</i>

35:48.236 --> 35:51.072
<i>If you contact the authorities
in any way again...</i>

35:53.107 --> 35:56.544
- <i>We will kill them.</i>
- Joe: <i>Wait. Wait, no!</i>

36:28.343 --> 36:29.777
Now look inside the car.

36:30.879 --> 36:33.281
- You see the backpack?
- Yes.

36:33.881 --> 36:37.151
You'll need a few items for this
next assignment.

36:38.018 --> 36:39.520
<i>Please just show them to me.</i>

37:23.464 --> 37:25.832
Zoe: <i>Rhea, it's a grocery
bagging job.</i>

37:25.834 --> 37:28.134
<i>They don't care how you look. They'd
hire you if you had a nose ring</i>

37:28.136 --> 37:30.136
- <i>on the back of your head.</i>
- Rhea: <i>Hey, everybody cares</i>

37:30.138 --> 37:31.573
<i>what I look like.</i> (laughs)

37:31.839 --> 37:33.373
<i>Besides, how much longer
can you</i>

37:33.540 --> 37:35.475
<i>possibly stand me sleeping
on your couch for?</i>

37:35.477 --> 37:39.348
- Zoe: <i>That's very true.</i>
- Rhea: <i>Seriously, though.</i>

37:41.783 --> 37:45.653

Control: <i>Look in the bag.
Take out the tablet.</i>

38:33.602 --> 38:35.170
<i>You recognize this man?</i>

38:35.870 --> 38:38.639
Yeah, that's Charles Margrey.

38:39.408 --> 38:41.409
He's the president of Redlock,
where I work.

38:42.176 --> 38:43.911
Now you know who to look for.

38:44.812 --> 38:49.117
<i>Grab your bag, we're moving in.
Don't forget your mask.</i>

38:51.853 --> 38:54.256
Place the small black box
on the security panel.

39:11.473 --> 39:15.444
- Sabi: <i>All right, we're in.</i>
- It's time to see what you're made of.

39:28.689 --> 39:30.124
What am I doing here?

39:31.526 --> 39:32.995
(exhales)

39:33.794 --> 39:36.230
You're insane. I can't do this.

39:37.098 --> 39:38.767
You're wasting time, Joe.

39:40.835 --> 39:42.033
(exhales)

39:42.035 --> 39:43.871
Go upstairs to the third floor.

39:44.038 --> 39:46.175
- He's in the room at the end of the hall.
- Joe: <i>All right.</i>

39:48.576 --> 39:49.911
Okay.

39:56.951 --> 39:58.454
Control: <i>Impressive, isn't it?</i>

39:59.288 --> 40:02.290
<i>Charles Margrey had a simple
idea that put him on the map.</i>

40:03.257 --> 40:05.727
How do we beat the Soviets
in Afghanistan?

40:06.261 --> 40:09.331
<i>We arm and fund the mujahideen
to fight them.</i>

40:11.265 --> 40:14.001
The politicians
called it genius.

(buzzing)

40:18.839 --> 40:22.076
(breathes deeply)

40:22.444 --> 40:24.546
Seven years later
the Soviets were defeated.

40:25.245 --> 40:31.318
They gave this terrorist keys to his own
weapons research facility as a reward.

40:32.020 --> 40:36.225
Thirteen years later two towers
fell in Manhattan.

40:37.658 --> 40:41.095
Take a good, long, hard look
around, Joe.

40:42.263 --> 40:44.799
<i>This is what death can buy you.</i>

41:12.026 --> 41:13.228
Look in the bag.

41:14.196 --> 41:15.761
You're gonna put that gun
to his head.

41:15.763 --> 41:18.065
Threaten his life
unless he opens his safe.

41:24.038 --> 41:25.507

Joe: Get up! Get up!

41:41.056 --> 41:42.690
Charles: What the hell
is going on?

41:42.857 --> 41:45.093
- Joe: Take me to your safe!
- Take it easy with that gun.

41:45.359 --> 41:48.829
- Just take me to your safe on the second floor, goddammit!
- Okay, okay, all right.

41:49.196 --> 41:52.433
- Joe: Get up! Let's go!
- Okay.

41:58.540 --> 41:59.575
Joe: Come on.

42:03.678 --> 42:05.580
In the safe. Get it.

42:12.252 --> 42:14.055
The laptop on the center shelf.

42:15.189 --> 42:17.124
Get the laptop
on the center shelf.

42:17.459 --> 42:18.594
Just grab it.

42:21.830 --> 42:22.830
Come on.

42:23.431 --> 42:26.935
- Tell him to authorize it.
- Authorize it.

42:42.116 --> 42:43.517
Control: <i>Put your finger

42:44.319 --> 42:45.353
Back up.

42:51.593 --> 42:52.995
(beeping)

42:57.230 --> 42:59.600
Sabi: <i>You were right, Doctor.
It is him.</i>

43:00.134 --> 43:01.636
(Sabi gasps) <i>Wow.</i>

43:03.605 --> 43:06.105
- Look at that.
- That's impossible.

43:06.107 --> 43:09.009
Control: <i>Take the small metallic
LED device from your backpack.</i>

43:09.544 --> 43:12.547

- Place it on the laptop.

43:18.786 --> 43:19.988
All right.

43:20.522 --> 43:23.255
Okay, the data is transferred
and I have a cloned copy

43:23.257 --> 43:24.660
<i>of all your work coming up.</i>

43:25.792 --> 43:29.296
Good, Joe. We have what we need.

43:30.131 --> 43:33.367
- <i>Tell him to get on his knees.</i>
- No.

43:34.736 --> 43:36.569
<i>You said no one
was gonna get hurt.</i>

43:36.571 --> 43:39.071
- I said no such thing.
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

43:39.073 --> 43:40.973
- (groans)

43:40.975 --> 43:43.308

- Control: <i>I need it powered on.</i>

43:43.310 --> 43:45.646

- Joe.

43:47.814 --> 43:51.485
<i>Wait. Wait. No, no, no.
It's me, Joe.</i>

43:52.053 --> 43:53.221

43:59.861 --> 44:01.730
- <i>Jesus.</i>
- Joe: <i>Trust me. Believe me.</i>

44:02.263 --> 44:05.931
<i>There is a man and he's in my
head and he's talking to me.</i>

<i>You're watching me right now,
aren't you, you crazy bastard?</i>

44:16.477 --> 44:19.911
I shut down the program
for a reason.

44:19.913 --> 44:22.848
- <i>It's too dangerous.</i>
- Walk forward now, Joe,

44:22.850 --> 44:23.984
or he will kill you.

44:24.652 --> 44:27.252
- <i>Tell him he's right.</i>
- He says you're right.

44:27.254 --> 44:30.157

<i>That's if you make it

51:35.683 --> 51:37.885
Because that's the way

He's gone.

54:08.468 --> 54:10.003
I could have held him together.

54:11.339 --> 54:13.341
I should have never given up
on him.

54:22.783 --> 54:24.185
(sirens wailing)

54:28.489 --> 54:30.522
<i>If you are just
joining us here is a recap</i>

54:30.524 --> 54:33.991
<i>of what we know right now.
A horrific scene.</i>

54:33.993 --> 54:36.361
<i>A massive explosion
that has destroyed</i>

54:36.363 --> 54:39.366
<i>a government research lab,
Redlock.</i>

54:39.632 --> 54:42.100
<i>They have a long history
of weapons research</i>

54:42.102 --> 54:44.938
<i>with the department of defense.
Now early today authorities...</i>

54:45.105 --> 54:47.075
- (Joe screams)
- <i>...acknowledged there were...</i>

54:50.011 --> 54:51.512
<i>...rescue workers
that have been...</i>

54:51.678 --> 54:52.712
(Joe screams)

54:53.314 --> 54:54.812
Reporter: <i>...the cause
of the explosion</i>

54:54.814 --> 54:56.116
<i>is still unknown.</i>

54:56.417 --> 54:58.183
<i>It was heard over
a ten mile distance,</i>

54:58.185 --> 55:00.351
<i>shattering windows
in the adjacent...</i>

55:00.353 --> 55:02.288
(Joe screams)

55:02.556 --> 55:04.458
Reporter:
<i>...they are still at this point</i>

55:04.857 --> 55:06.294
<i>searching for survivors.</i>

55:06.527 --> 55:08.393
<i>Senior management
have refused to comment</i>

55:08.395 --> 55:10.728
<i>on whether or not weapons
were in fact</i>

55:10.730 --> 55:12.397
<i>located at the facility,</i>

55:12.399 --> 55:15.000
<i>which could explain
the level...</i>

55:15.002 --> 55:16.371
You're here now, aren't you?

55:20.774 --> 55:23.176
What did you do to me?
Where are you!

55:23.410 --> 55:26.446
(Reporter continues
in the background)

55:26.680 --> 55:29.817
Reporter: <i>The FBI has not
determined whether or not...</i>

55:33.587 --> 55:37.190
- Stop fucking with me!
- There are four fundamental forces, Joe.

55:37.457 --> 55:41.025
- <i>Gravity. Electromagnetism.</i>
- Why are you doing this to me!

55:41.027 --> 55:43.730
The strong nuclear force.
The weak one.

55:45.064 --> 55:47.232
<i>Weakness is something
you're familiar with,</i>

55:47.234 --> 55:48.900
- <i>aren't you Joe?</i>
- I have to call...

55:48.902 --> 55:50.671
Control:
<i>The weak force destroys,</i>

55:50.937 --> 55:52.238
<i>but through that decay</i>

55:53.174 --> 55:56.543
we have the furnace of the sun
that brings life.

55:56.910 --> 55:59.147
It's not work... fuck!

56:00.681 --> 56:01.983
(garbled audio)

56:04.252 --> 56:06.020
Why are you doing this to me?

56:06.687 --> 56:08.422
I did what you asked me to!

56:09.189 --> 56:11.690
Let me see her!
Let me talk to her...

56:11.692 --> 56:12.893
Leave us alone!

56:13.060 --> 56:15.863
- (high-pitched buzzing)
- What...

56:19.899 --> 56:21.401
What did you do to me?

56:22.035 --> 56:24.305
(high-pitched buzzing)

56:25.172 --> 56:26.270
Oh God.

56:26.272 --> 56:27.307
(screams)

56:31.712 --> 56:33.181
(Joe screaming)

56:34.147 --> 56:36.750
- (rumbling)
- (buzzing)

56:41.055 --> 56:42.989
(Joe screams)

56:48.194 --> 56:49.196
Amazing.

56:49.864 --> 56:52.998
(Joe breathing heavily)

56:53.000 --> 56:55.469
(screams)

56:57.004 --> 56:58.536
What's happening to me?

56:58.538 --> 57:00.741
Control: <i>I have blessed you,
Joe.</i>

57:01.375 --> 57:03.107
<i>By taking your
greatest weakness</i>

57:03.109 --> 57:04.777
<i>and turning it into a strength.</i>

57:05.111 --> 57:07.511
<i>The anger, the fear,
the anxiety.</i>

57:07.513 --> 57:11.117
<i>That chaos living inside you
that tore your life apart,</i>

57:11.384 --> 57:14.955
<i>I've harnessed it into a
source of infinite power.</i>

57:15.989 --> 57:18.857
<i>And now I need you
to use that power, Joe.</i>

57:18.859 --> 57:20.991
<i>To do what you've
always wanted.</i>

57:20.993 --> 57:22.595
<i>To keep them together.</i>

57:22.863 --> 57:25.366
<i>To save your family's life.</i>

57:26.100 --> 57:29.268
<i>You were always meant for more,
Joseph Steadman,</i>

57:29.270 --> 57:33.672
<i>But first you need to pass
my tests designed specifically</i>

57:33.674 --> 57:36.509
<i>to unlock
your greatest potential.</i>

57:36.877 --> 57:38.645
<i>But I need you to be strong.</i>

57:39.113 --> 57:41.082
Show me how strong
you really are.

57:44.852 --> 57:46.884
<i>Now get on your feet.
You have fifteen minutes</i>

57:46.886 --> 57:48.254
<i>to get to the next location.</i>

57:48.888 --> 57:51.457
Alright. Whatever, you psycho.

57:52.225 --> 57:54.227
Just point me
in the right direction.

57:55.796 --> 57:58.131
Fifteen minutes, Joe.
And you'll need your gun.

58:00.301 --> 58:02.136
Alright, he's stabilizing.

58:09.210 --> 58:11.212
(breathing heavily)

58:13.915 --> 58:14.915
Joe: <i>Where's my car?</i>

58:15.616 --> 58:17.149
<i>Where's my car?
How do you...</i>

58:17.151 --> 58:18.783
<i>I can't get there without...</i>

58:18.785 --> 58:20.555
- (bang)
- (groans)

58:23.189 --> 58:24.892
Do you think
there's someone out there?

58:25.393 --> 58:27.562
Your wife in heaven
watching over you?

58:28.361 --> 58:31.431
There is no heaven, Joe.
And your wife is dead.

58:31.698 --> 58:33.566
(Joe screams)

58:34.535 --> 58:37.038
- (high-pitched buzzing)
- (engine revving)

58:38.839 --> 58:40.174
Sabi: <i>Look at that.</i>

58:41.207 --> 58:44.443
The astonishing thing
about electromagnetism...

58:45.212 --> 58:48.114
is that it has infinite range.

58:48.348 --> 58:50.383
<i>Now you see
how this works, Joe.</i>

58:50.783 --> 58:53.854
<i>The angrier you get,
the more you unlock.</i>

58:54.087 --> 58:57.123
<i>Cause and effect.
Now get on the bike.</i>

58:58.692 --> 59:00.625
Joe: Alright. Where am I going?

59:00.627 --> 59:02.696
Control: <i>To see how far
we can push it.</i>

59:03.263 --> 59:05.165
Cause and effect.

59:05.966 --> 59:08.069
(tense music playing)

59:17.009 --> 59:18.446
(tires screeching)

59:22.848 --> 59:24.151
Joe: Okay. Then what?

59:24.384 --> 59:26.152
Once I'm at this place
what do I do?

59:26.419 --> 59:28.721
Control: You get inside
and confront this man.

59:29.056 --> 59:31.758
- Joe: Who?
- Control: <i>His name is Nico Sola.</i>

59:32.658 --> 59:34.859
<i>The man
who took your daughter Rhea</i>

59:34.861 --> 59:36.963
<i>under his wing after you left.</i>

59:39.732 --> 59:41.334
(engine revving)

59:43.603 --> 59:45.471
<i>The same man
who got her hooked</i>

59:45.473 --> 59:48.776
<i>and kept her that way.
Cause and effect, Joe.</i>

59:49.109 --> 59:51.112
<i>Cause and effect.</i>

59:51.877 --> 59:53.980
(music continues)

01:00:02.823 --> 01:00:05.359
Joe: <i>There are powers out there
that are greater than us</i>

01:00:10.163 --> 01:00:11.464
<i>And we can't control.</i>

01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:16.270
<i>All we can do is...</i>

01:00:18.172 --> 01:00:19.407
<i>is let go.</i>

01:00:21.642 --> 01:00:24.511
(clang in slow motion)

01:00:28.647 --> 01:00:31.049
Back it up. Now!

01:00:31.051 --> 01:00:32.286
- You back it up!
- Woah!

01:00:33.087 --> 01:00:35.156
- Relax.
- Joe: Move!

01:00:58.212 --> 01:01:01.015
(electronic music playing
in distance)

01:01:25.004 --> 01:01:27.474
(electronic music playing)

01:01:38.785 --> 01:01:40.087
Joe: Hey!

01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:44.758
Hey! Are you Nico?

01:01:47.127 --> 01:01:48.295
Hey!

01:01:51.931 --> 01:01:53.234
Is your name Nico?

01:01:54.935 --> 01:01:56.335
- Smile!
- Joe: Woah!

01:01:56.669 --> 01:01:59.305
- (camera clicking)
- (Joe groans)

01:02:04.745 --> 01:02:06.781
- (woman laughing)
- (Joe groans)

01:02:13.786 --> 01:02:15.122
(Joe screams)

01:02:18.158 --> 01:02:19.493
(thud)

01:02:23.897 --> 01:02:25.399
(Nico speaking indistinctly)

01:02:26.165 --> 01:02:27.634
Nico: Big bad wolf.

01:02:29.669 --> 01:02:30.837
(Nico chuckles)

01:02:33.906 --> 01:02:35.109
Name!

01:02:39.913 --> 01:02:41.148
Steadman.

01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:45.553
Steadman?

01:02:47.654 --> 01:02:48.656
Steadman.

01:02:49.522 --> 01:02:51.825
(woman crying on TV)

01:02:53.093 --> 01:02:54.227
You're Rhea's old man.

01:02:54.794 --> 01:02:56.363
- Huh?
- (woman crying continues)

01:02:56.796 --> 01:02:57.929
Okay.

01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:59.133
(laughs) Okay.

01:03:00.334 --> 01:03:01.301
<i>Okay.</i>

01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:03.969
Here we go.
You don't understand.

01:03:04.169 --> 01:03:05.305
You just...

01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:09.743
There she is.

01:03:10.944 --> 01:03:12.344
(Nico laughs)

01:03:12.779 --> 01:03:15.515
You're gonna love this.
(laughing)

01:03:16.082 --> 01:03:17.451
You shouldn't do this.

01:03:20.721 --> 01:03:22.590
<i>And... Action!</i>

01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:26.660
<i>You got some hero...</i>

01:03:26.926 --> 01:03:30.195
<i>fuckin' save the day thing
going on, right?</i>

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:34.701
- (sniffs) Oh!
- (coughs) (laughing)

01:03:35.835 --> 01:03:36.770
Shit!

01:03:37.002 --> 01:03:38.439
That's your daughter, hero.

01:03:41.709 --> 01:03:44.044
Joe: You baked that?
That's beautiful.

01:03:44.377 --> 01:03:47.413
And it has no egg in it,
all natural.

01:03:47.647 --> 01:03:49.450
- Joe: That's the best.
- Rhea: Mmm-hmm.

01:03:55.989 --> 01:03:58.558
(music rising to crescendo)

01:03:58.825 --> 01:04:04.698
- (groans)
- (high-pitched buzzing)

01:04:09.902 --> 01:04:12.805
(alarm beeping)

01:04:15.908 --> 01:04:18.378
(ominous music playing)

01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:39.366
(Nico coughing)

01:04:43.102 --> 01:04:44.504
(coughs)

01:04:52.846 --> 01:04:54.281
(Nico screams)

01:04:57.283 --> 01:04:58.485
(Nico cries out)

01:05:06.225 --> 01:05:08.494
(gunshots)

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:12.265
What the fuck are you?

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:17.538
(chokes)

01:05:18.605 --> 01:05:20.975
(intense music playing)

01:05:30.582 --> 01:05:31.985
Woman: Somebody help!

01:05:32.618 --> 01:05:34.654
(woman screaming)

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.997
(engine revving)

01:05:45.364 --> 01:05:46.899
(girl coughing)

01:05:57.243 --> 01:05:58.478
(bullet ricochets)

01:05:59.111 --> 01:06:00.847
Die motherfucker!

01:06:02.348 --> 01:06:03.549
(groans)

01:06:04.116 --> 01:06:05.486

- (high-pitched buzzing)

01:06:13.861 --> 01:06:15.562
(drone buzzes)

01:06:17.631 --> 01:06:19.665
Joe: <i>That's enough!
What's happening!</i>

01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:21.701
<i>How am I doing this?</i>

01:06:21.868 --> 01:06:23.570
Control: <i>You haven't done
anything, Joe.</i>

01:06:24.102 --> 01:06:25.938
- Joe: <i>But I just...</i>
- Control: <i>You failed</i>

01:06:26.172 --> 01:06:27.140
<i>once again.</i>

01:06:27.873 --> 01:06:29.609
<i>The police are on their way.</i>

01:06:30.176 --> 01:06:31.378
<i>Turn yourself in.</i>

01:06:32.546 --> 01:06:34.848
<i>I need you to dig deeper, Joe.</i>

01:06:35.149 --> 01:06:37.750
<i>We need to unlock more.</i>

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.223
- Police: Freeze!
- Drop your weapon!

01:06:46.225 --> 01:06:48.359
- Okay, okay! Okay!
- Put the gun on the ground. Now!

01:06:48.361 --> 01:06:51.129
- Get down!
- Just don't wanna hurt anyone else!

01:06:51.131 --> 01:06:53.567
- I said get on the ground, now.
- Stay away!

01:06:53.966 --> 01:06:55.535
Get on the ground!

01:06:56.136 --> 01:06:58.906
(policeman screams)

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.942
(indistinct police radio)

01:07:03.176 --> 01:07:04.210
Joe: You don't understand.

01:07:04.911 --> 01:07:07.545
I'm dangerous. I don't
know how to control this!

01:07:07.547 --> 01:07:09.950
(sirens wailing)

01:07:17.223 --> 01:07:19.959
(Joe groaning)

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.528
You're making a mistake.

01:07:22.962 --> 01:07:23.962
Just wait!

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:26.567
Wait! You don't understand!

01:07:28.301 --> 01:07:30.503
Lieutenant: Gridlock
was annihilated two days ago,

01:07:30.736 --> 01:07:33.339
taking out half a city block.
Now this shit?

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.241
<i>Two blasts, two days.</i>

01:07:35.908 --> 01:07:37.875
<i>And we got you in both places...</i>

01:07:37.877 --> 01:07:39.743
The third force of nature
is the strong nuclear force.

01:07:39.745 --> 01:07:41.513
Detective: You've been lying
to us for two hours.

01:07:41.515 --> 01:07:43.348
Control: <i>Destroy a single atom
and you get Hiroshima.</i>

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:45.051
- Just shut up.
- Hey, look at me!

01:07:45.252 --> 01:07:47.018
And you better start
telling the truth.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:49.187
For Christ's sake
I'm telling you the truth.

01:07:49.189 --> 01:07:51.788
What's that Nico Sola got to do
with that research facility uptown?

01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:53.458
It looked like a war zone.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.991
- Who are you working for?
- Control: <i>Tell them</i>

01:07:54.993 --> 01:07:56.296
you're working
for a higher power.

01:07:57.196 --> 01:07:59.629
- I'm working for a higher power.
- What are you, a terrorist?

01:07:59.631 --> 01:08:01.133
- No!
- People died,

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.768
- you son of a bitch!
- Control: <i>Now that's established,</i>

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:06.036
let them know you've left a
rather advanced explosive device

01:08:06.038 --> 01:08:07.871

- Joe: He's got a bomb.

01:08:10.442 --> 01:08:12.509
- Who's... who's got a bomb?
- Lieutenant: Jesus.

01:08:12.511 --> 01:08:15.381

If you find that bomb first,
everybody lives.

01:08:24.825 --> 01:08:26.425
But if they find it before you

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:29.095
<i>I would estimate 20,000 dead.</i>

01:08:29.696 --> 01:08:31.429
That's an awful lot of blood
on your hands, Joe.

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:33.663

01:08:33.666 --> 01:08:35.633
You can keep whining

about it.

01:08:37.303 --> 01:08:38.572
Talk to me!
