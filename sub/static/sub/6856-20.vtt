00:16.635 --> 00:17.558
<i>Invasion!</i>

00:17.938 --> 00:21.788
<i>Separatist leader Wat Tambor
has taken control of the planet Ryloth</i>

00:22.124 --> 00:25.674
<i>and subjugates its people
through a brutal droid occupation.</i>

00:26.235 --> 00:29.445
<i>In a daring surprise attack,
Jedi Anakin Skywalker</i>

00:29.613 --> 00:31.072
<i>and his padawan, Ahsoka Tano,</i>

00:31.439 --> 00:34.158
<i>defeated the space blockade
guarding the planet.</i>

00:34.501 --> 00:37.401
<i>Now Jedi Generals Mace Windu
and Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>

00:38.124 --> 00:41.315
<i>lead a massive invasion
to liberate the starving people.</i>

00:41.440 --> 00:44.249
First trick will be getting our troops
on the ground.

00:44.419 --> 00:47.963
If you take the city of Nabat first,
we'll have our landing zone.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.800
Well, it's time to meet the natives.

01:08.481 --> 01:11.529
<i>You must not allow the clones
to reach the surface.</i>

01:11.941 --> 01:14.689
Our new proton cannon
are in the optimum position

01:14.814 --> 01:16.200
to prevent that, sir.

01:16.751 --> 01:17.751
<i>What?</i>

01:18.766 --> 01:21.205
<i>What if they focus the attack
on your cannon?</i>

01:21.770 --> 01:25.918
I am utilizing the prisoners
from this village as living shields.

01:26.692 --> 01:30.514
I calculate the Jedi will not risk
the prisoners' safety

01:30.695 --> 01:32.133
with a direct assault.

01:39.503 --> 01:41.183
We need to remember why we're here.

01:41.376 --> 01:44.526
We came to aid the Twi-leks,
not destroy their home.

01:45.068 --> 01:46.068
Cody?

01:46.425 --> 01:48.568
That means we'll be taking it back
the hard way.

01:48.693 --> 01:51.690
Minimal destruction with blasters
and droid poppers only.

01:51.815 --> 01:53.946
No rockets or detonators.
Check your aim.

01:54.420 --> 01:57.129
Keep an eye out for the locals.
Am I understood?

01:57.254 --> 01:58.325
Sir, yes, sir!

01:59.433 --> 02:01.281
If we're her
to free the tail-heads,

02:01.406 --> 02:03.497
the list they can do is
get out of our way.

02:04.378 --> 02:06.228
Sir, the enemy is in range.

02:06.863 --> 02:08.169
Fire at will.

02:27.691 --> 02:30.791
General, the enemy fire
is penetrating our shields.

02:31.274 --> 02:32.443
Get me Kenobi.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.294
<i>We can't risk landing
the larger transports</i>

02:35.419 --> 02:38.783
- <i>until you take out those guns.</i>
- Pull back. We'll take care of it.

02:43.885 --> 02:46.693
Commander, the Republic transports
have turned away,

02:46.818 --> 02:49.068
but the gunships
are still heading toward us.

02:49.194 --> 02:51.128
Just as I calculated.

03:22.995 --> 03:26.361
I think I see movement in the trees.
Fire, fire!

03:43.521 --> 03:45.506
That bunker is gonna be
a problem, General.

03:45.631 --> 03:48.352
Leave the bunker to me.
Bring in your troopers on my signal!

03:59.632 --> 04:01.132
Let's take them out!

04:14.492 --> 04:16.291
Ghost company. Let's move!

04:17.759 --> 04:20.885
Sir, I've lost contact
with our outer defenses.

04:21.445 --> 04:24.697
The Republic troops
have overrun the village perimeter.

04:24.822 --> 04:27.570
Find out
how the Jedi plan to attack.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.252
Roger, roger.

04:31.352 --> 04:34.273
The wall is secure, sir.
Are we moving on to the guns?

04:34.687 --> 04:37.448
We need to know
what the droids have in store for us.

04:37.573 --> 04:39.273
Send your best men to scout ahead.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.971
Will do, sir.

04:41.528 --> 04:43.328
Boil, Waxer, come with me.

04:43.837 --> 04:45.451
I guess we're the best.

04:58.572 --> 05:00.522
Buildings are just buildings.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.427
What really makes a city
are the inhabitants that live in it.

05:04.009 --> 05:05.679
So where are they?

05:08.206 --> 05:10.950
We'll check out the courtyard.
You two, take the south sector.

05:11.075 --> 05:13.164
Be back at command by 0620.

05:13.449 --> 05:14.449
Yes, sir.

05:16.305 --> 05:18.782
I tell you, Boil, this is creepy.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.324
You think they've killed
all of them?

05:22.449 --> 05:24.369
Well, there are no bodies.

05:24.770 --> 05:28.420
They were driven from their homes.
I don't think they had a...

05:29.214 --> 05:30.261
Had a what?

05:32.635 --> 05:33.635
Choice.

05:47.867 --> 05:50.260
Not going to be easy
getting to those guns, sir.

05:50.385 --> 05:52.309
There is always a way, Wooley.

05:59.947 --> 06:01.197
Wait, Twi'leks.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.697
They're holding
all the survivors hostage.

06:05.322 --> 06:07.922
We have to report this
to General Kenobi.

06:24.746 --> 06:28.174
They're in the courtyard here and here.
But there's a complication.

06:28.325 --> 06:31.389
They've taken the locals hostage
and they're using them as shields.

06:31.514 --> 06:35.013
The Twi'lek prisoners will make this
difficult but not impossible.

06:35.138 --> 06:38.313
I still have a good plan
for taking out those guns.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.734
<i>Getting the villagers out of harm's way
is our first priority.</i>

06:41.859 --> 06:43.569
<i>I have faith in you, General Kenobi.</i>

06:44.013 --> 06:46.076
Cody, we'll go in
with everything we have.

06:46.201 --> 06:47.448
Clear those hostages.

06:48.783 --> 06:52.911
So it's General Kenobi
who is leading this assault.

06:53.515 --> 06:56.065
He is known
for his deceptive maneuvers.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.459
Roger, roger. Download his file.

07:12.487 --> 07:15.328
- It's just a little girl.
- What are we going to do with her?

07:16.213 --> 07:17.978
Why do we have to do anything?

07:18.146 --> 07:21.231
- We've got a mission to finish.
- We should do something.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.768
- I say we take her with us.
- You can't be serious.

07:23.893 --> 07:25.527
She'll only slow us down.

07:26.327 --> 07:29.281
- Look, she's afraid of us.
- Not us. Quick, hide!

07:32.342 --> 07:34.495
That was a recon unit.
We'd better get moving.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.080
We can't leave her here.

07:36.936 --> 07:38.123
Fine, we'll take her.

07:39.602 --> 07:40.766
Be careful.

07:40.891 --> 07:43.462
Don't worry, Waxer.
I don't think she's armed.

07:45.467 --> 07:47.167
Little tail-head bit me.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.218
Stop, you're scaring her.

07:50.079 --> 07:52.229
She probably thinks we're droids.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.619
It's all right.
See, I'm flesh and blood,

08:00.188 --> 08:01.330
just like you.

08:01.455 --> 08:03.105
She looks half starved.

08:03.954 --> 08:04.954
Here.

08:23.518 --> 08:25.159
No, I'm Waxer.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.111
He's Boil.

08:29.719 --> 08:32.269
You made a friend.
Mission accomplished.

08:32.677 --> 08:33.720
Can we go now?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.230
Come on, kid.

08:37.950 --> 08:38.950
Come on.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.703
Look, she doesn't even want to go.

08:41.828 --> 08:45.328
Little monster was fine
before we came along, so let's move.

09:11.832 --> 09:14.032
Sergeant, are the creatures ready?

09:14.244 --> 09:16.232
I starved them,
like you ordered, sir.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.558
I wonder what happened
to her family.

09:30.683 --> 09:33.489
They're probably dead.
Hopefully, she'll survive this mess.

09:37.897 --> 09:41.061
So what happens to her?
I mean, after we leave.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.481
I don't know.

09:43.084 --> 09:45.918
Don't get any ideas.
We're not taking her with us.

09:49.518 --> 09:50.568
She's gone.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.957
I'm sure the little biter
will turn up.

09:57.793 --> 09:58.993
There you are.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.032
How'd she get in front of us?

10:07.389 --> 10:10.707
No, don't go that way!
That's where the recon droid went.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.209
Waxer, let her go.

10:12.334 --> 10:15.134
I'm not just going
to let the droids get her.

10:15.377 --> 10:17.577
I'm just trying to keep you alive!

10:18.797 --> 10:20.410
I'll be darned if I know why.

10:28.069 --> 10:29.378
Where's she going?

10:37.585 --> 10:39.135
Wait! Hold on, there!

10:44.231 --> 10:45.589
There you are.

10:46.323 --> 10:47.873
Good, you caught her.

10:47.998 --> 10:50.131
You know,
I have binders if we need 'em.

10:50.256 --> 10:51.191
What?

10:57.303 --> 10:59.353
What are we doing here, anyway?

11:25.789 --> 11:27.589
I guess this was her home.

11:28.327 --> 11:30.689
Poor little thing. She lost it all.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.837
It's okay now.
We're here to help.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.122
Don't cry, kid.
We'll keep you safe.

12:13.151 --> 12:14.151
I promise.

12:22.016 --> 12:24.066
The men set, Cody?
What is it?

12:24.385 --> 12:26.212
Waxer and Boil are not responding.

12:26.337 --> 12:29.649
- They never returned from scouting.
- That isn't like them.

12:29.774 --> 12:31.589
They may have run into trouble.

12:31.714 --> 12:33.959
Sergeant,
use the high-powered transmitter,

12:34.129 --> 12:36.524
- {\to }see if you can reach Waxer and Boil.
- Yes, sir!

12:36.649 --> 12:40.349
Let's get the rest of the men moving.
The others will catch up.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.510
They are on the move.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.962
Sergeant, the attack is coming.

12:45.715 --> 12:47.165
Release the beasts.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.900
It is time to execute my plan.

12:50.151 --> 12:51.301
Roger, roger.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.525
It's the commander.
We're way overdue, Waxer.

13:03.652 --> 13:06.252
We're going to end up
polishing R2 units.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.861
Wait. How are we going
to explain all this, her?

13:10.947 --> 13:12.082
You're asking me?

13:12.250 --> 13:15.090
Maybe if we hurry back, we can tell them
we ran into a little trouble.

13:15.215 --> 13:16.464
Oh, that's for sure.

13:16.589 --> 13:18.797
And our transmissions
were jammed by the droids.

13:19.545 --> 13:22.069
It's worth a try.
But mark my words,

13:22.552 --> 13:24.385
this will end badly.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.655
I think I know
why the kid never came back here.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.633
You see what happens
when we don't follow orders?

13:48.758 --> 13:50.358
Let's get out of here!

13:55.902 --> 13:57.802
These suckers won't give up!

13:58.155 --> 14:00.445
You grab the gun
and I'll hold 'em back.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.779
- Aim for their eyes!
- Look out, look out!

14:44.904 --> 14:45.904
Fall back!

14:46.969 --> 14:50.288
The Republic ground troops
have been routed, Emir.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.404
<i>What was that?</i>

14:52.529 --> 14:54.968
I calculate the remaing clones

14:55.093 --> 14:57.743
are attempting
a desperate final offensive.

14:58.342 --> 15:00.642
Their chances of success against us

15:01.167 --> 15:03.527
are 742:1.

15:03.989 --> 15:05.567
<i>You had better be right.</i>

15:06.218 --> 15:07.218
I am a droid.

15:07.914 --> 15:09.314
I am always right.

15:42.126 --> 15:43.126
No, wait.

15:57.283 --> 15:59.374
- Incredible.
- Quiet, rookie.

16:00.031 --> 16:01.334
Shoot the bridge!

16:24.785 --> 16:25.942
Don't shoot.

16:34.075 --> 16:36.661
Waxer, Boil.
Where have you two slackers been?

16:37.159 --> 16:39.034
Sir, there is an explanation.

16:39.159 --> 16:40.609
We got sidetracked.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.378
I think I see what sidetracked you.

16:45.835 --> 16:47.972
The clones have defeated
the creatures.

16:48.097 --> 16:50.648
Yes, but their numbers are thin.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.053
Prepare for their final attack.

16:55.134 --> 16:56.534
Hello, little one.

16:56.942 --> 16:58.844
She brought us here
through the tunnels.

16:58.969 --> 17:01.581
Knows her way around them
pretty good, sir.

17:08.946 --> 17:11.458
The girl can lead us
through the tunnel to the prisoners.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.873
Cody,
we're going to need a diversion.

17:31.068 --> 17:34.731
Yup, this is about the worst job
in the droid army.

17:36.961 --> 17:37.961
What?

17:40.508 --> 17:41.508
What?

17:45.788 --> 17:48.438
I'll take care of this.
You keep her here.

18:16.976 --> 18:18.726
There they are. Let's go!

18:45.240 --> 18:46.708
Pull back! Pull back!

18:52.340 --> 18:54.290
Commander, we have a problem.

18:54.562 --> 18:56.762
The Jedi is freeing the prisoners.

19:09.923 --> 19:10.923
Numa!

19:17.666 --> 19:19.466
Waxer, Boil, come with me.

19:20.317 --> 19:21.675
We're with you, sir.

19:38.737 --> 19:39.987
Ready, General.

19:46.117 --> 19:47.917
Setting Alpha five or six!

19:54.736 --> 19:56.286
Where's the override?

20:28.354 --> 20:30.489
You lose, General Kenobi.

20:33.704 --> 20:36.293
Does not compute.
Does not compute.

20:36.622 --> 20:39.022
Does not compute.
Does not compute...

21:01.421 --> 21:03.230
Great job getting rid
of those cannons.

21:03.355 --> 21:05.575
Now we have
a more difficult objective.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.500
We must take the capital
and free this world.

21:09.270 --> 21:11.020
See ya later, little one.

21:17.155 --> 21:18.155
Hey, numa.

21:19.169 --> 21:20.669
Stay out of trouble.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.792
Don't be afraid. We'll be back.

21:41.326 --> 21:43.776
Sir, what is that
she keeps calling us?

21:43.920 --> 21:45.999
<i>Nerra.</i> It means "brother."
