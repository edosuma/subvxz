01:03.641 --> 01:06.410

It's pretty little.

01:06.411 --> 01:10.048
I feel as if it's proportion...

01:10.049 --> 01:12.216
that we are in proportion,

there always will be.

We are going to deal

03:51.508 --> 03:55.812
The first question is,
what is happening

03:55.813 --> 04:00.216
in terms of the distribution
of income and wealth?

04:00.217 --> 04:02.787

04:02.788 --> 04:05.589
Number three, is it a problem?

into this subject.

your assumptions.

If possible, I want to shake
your assumptions a little bit

04:29.680 --> 04:35.333
about why the system
works as it does.

04:48.333 --> 04:50.505
Some inequality is inevitable.

04:53.505 --> 04:55.472
If people are gonna have
the proper incentives

04:55.473 --> 04:59.478
to be productive, to work
hard, to be inventive...

05:01.478 --> 05:03.080
that's the essence
of capitalism,

05:03.081 --> 05:07.154
and capitalism does generate
a lot of good things.

05:09.154 --> 05:13.123
Look, the question
is not inequality per se.

05:13.124 --> 05:17.528
The question is, when does
inequality become a problem?

05:17.529 --> 05:21.165
How much inequality
can we tolerate

05:21.166 --> 05:23.900
and still have an economy
that's working for everyone

05:23.901 --> 05:27.703
and still have a democracy
that's functioning?

05:27.704 --> 05:31.909
Of all developed nations
today, the United States has

05:31.910 --> 05:36.580
the most unequal distribution
of income and wealth by far.

05:36.581 --> 05:41.552
And we're surging toward
even greater inequality.

05:41.553 --> 05:43.854
One way of looking at
and measuring inequality

05:43.855 --> 05:46.556
is to look at the earnings
of people at the top

05:46.557 --> 05:47.825
versus the earnings

05:47.826 --> 05:49.562
of the typical worker
in the middle.

05:51.562 --> 05:54.564
The typical male worker in 1978

05:54.565 --> 05:58.802
was making around $48,000,
adjusted for inflation,

05:58.803 --> 06:01.470
while the average person
in the top 1%

06:01.471 --> 06:04.874
earned $390,000.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.410
Now fast-forward.

06:06.411 --> 06:09.547
By 2010,
the typical male worker

06:09.548 --> 06:11.681
earned even less
than he did then,

06:11.682 --> 06:13.350
but the person at the top

06:13.351 --> 06:16.822
got more than twice as much
as before.

in 2008,

became front-page news.

how it got this bad

07:02.266 --> 07:03.406
or why.

07:09.406 --> 07:10.974
Not until the last few years

07:10.975 --> 07:14.410
have we really understood
all that much about inequality.

07:14.411 --> 07:17.780
I mean,
we knew the top 10% or 20%

07:17.781 --> 07:19.249
were moving in one direction

07:19.250 --> 07:21.886
and the bottom 10% or 20%
was moving in another.

07:21.887 --> 07:24.621

happening at the very top,

and Thomas Piketty,

07:34.798 --> 07:36.737
found a different
source of data.

07:38.737 --> 07:42.004
They looked at IRS tax data,

07:42.005 --> 07:44.340

over the last few years

07:44.341 --> 07:48.011
but all the way back to 1913,

07:48.012 --> 07:51.584
when the income tax
was instituted.

07:53.584 --> 07:56.487
It showed that there
were two peak years.

07:56.488 --> 08:01.290
1928 and 2007
become the peak years

08:01.291 --> 08:03.126
for income concentration,

08:03.127 --> 08:05.595
both of them in which the
top 1% is taking home

08:05.596 --> 08:08.668
more than 23% of total income.

08:10.668 --> 08:13.537
We knew that inequality
had started to increase

08:13.538 --> 08:16.006
in the late '70s and the 1980s,

08:16.007 --> 08:20.210
but we didn't know
how dramatically

08:20.211 --> 08:21.910
income concentration
had increased,

08:21.911 --> 08:24.147
especially within the top 1%.

08:24.148 --> 08:27.650

come out in 2003,

08:27.651 --> 08:29.753
it sat there
for a number of years,

to the financial sector,

incomes were stagnating,

10:06.918 --> 10:10.620

thing to understand

10:10.621 --> 10:13.790
is that consumer spending
is 70%

10:13.791 --> 10:16.759

is the heart

13:22.947 --> 13:24.848
$25 in your checking account,

13:24.849 --> 13:27.617
that's got to be...

13:27.618 --> 13:29.552
That's not very much.

13:29.553 --> 13:31.553
No, it's not.

13:31.554 --> 13:33.023
(SNIFFLES)

13:33.024 --> 13:35.591
But, I mean, it's Tues...
it's Wednesday.

13:35.592 --> 13:37.859
I'll survive today.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.061
I'll look up in the pantry,

13:39.062 --> 13:41.663
see what else is there to eat.

13:41.664 --> 13:44.968
I have a full tank of gas,
so I'm fine on that part.

13:44.969 --> 13:47.009
I don't need to go anywhere
right now.

13:53.009 --> 13:54.778
When I was laid off,
I decided to go ahead

13:54.779 --> 13:57.714
and pursue my degree
at that point.

13:57.715 --> 14:02.485
Most of the classmates I have
are a lot younger than I am.

14:02.486 --> 14:04.354
It's different
when you're reading about it

14:04.355 --> 14:06.422
or somebody else's issues.

14:06.423 --> 14:08.891
That's different from when
it's your own family's.

14:08.892 --> 14:10.159
So when it hits home,

14:10.160 --> 14:12.629
that's probably
the hardest part.

14:12.630 --> 14:17.100
There is no official definition
of the middle class.

14:17.101 --> 14:18.468
But Alan Krueger,

14:18.469 --> 14:20.403
chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisors,

14:20.404 --> 14:22.104
these are the percentage
of households

14:22.105 --> 14:27.643
with annual incomes within 50%
of the median household.

14:27.644 --> 14:32.285
$50,000, median income,
50% above, 50% below.

14:35.285 --> 14:37.653
If you're in the top %1,
you're earning

14:37.654 --> 14:40.790
at least $380,000 a year.

14:40.791 --> 14:42.892
If you're at the lower end
of this group,

14:42.893 --> 14:44.528
you're probably
at the top levels

14:44.529 --> 14:47.997
of the professional fields,
a top doctor or a top lawyer.

14:47.998 --> 14:49.298
Higher in this group,

14:49.299 --> 14:50.933
earning several million
dollars a year,

14:50.934 --> 14:54.403
are successful entrepreneurs
who start profitable companies.

14:54.404 --> 14:58.474
At the highest levels, earning
$10 million a year or more,

14:58.475 --> 15:00.743
are the CEOs of big companies,

15:00.744 --> 15:04.080
the heads of Wall Street
banks, top entertainers,

15:04.081 --> 15:06.883
and also the top sports stars.

15:06.884 --> 15:12.021
Last year, we made $36,000,
and we're a family of three.

15:12.022 --> 15:13.290
I think I probably make

15:13.291 --> 15:15.358
in between $45,000
and $50,000 a year

15:15.359 --> 15:19.129
working 70 hours a week,
six days a week.

15:19.130 --> 15:20.696
Combined income with the army

15:20.697 --> 15:27.070
and with my personal job,
maybe $55,000 to $60,000 a year.

15:27.071 --> 15:32.841
Probably close to $600,000.

15:32.842 --> 15:36.778
Usually more than $10 million,
less than $30 million

15:36.779 --> 15:38.148
but, you know, a lot,

15:38.149 --> 15:41.221
a ridiculous amount of money.

15:44.221 --> 15:46.755
I am an entrepreneur
and venture capitalist.

15:46.756 --> 15:49.959
My family owns a large
manufacturer of bed pillows

15:49.960 --> 15:52.394
and down comforters called
Pacific Coast Feather Company.

15:52.395 --> 15:54.297
We are, in fact,
one the largest manufacturers

15:54.298 --> 15:56.375
of those things in the world.

16:05.375 --> 16:08.311
The problem
with rising inequality is,

16:08.312 --> 16:11.080
a person like me,
who earns 1,000 times as much

16:11.081 --> 16:13.649
as the typical American,

16:13.650 --> 16:16.418
doesn't buy 1,000 pillows
a year.

16:16.419 --> 16:20.293
Even the richest people only
sleep on one or two pillows.

16:22.293 --> 16:24.393
The pillow business
is quite tough,

16:24.394 --> 16:27.196
as it is for many,
many industries,

16:27.197 --> 16:31.367
because fewer and fewer
people can afford to buy

16:31.368 --> 16:34.206
the products that we make.

16:36.206 --> 16:38.543
(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)

16:40.543 --> 16:42.311
And I have the nicest
Audi you can get,

16:42.312 --> 16:45.281
but it's still only one Audi.

16:45.282 --> 16:47.517
I personally hate fancy food.

16:47.518 --> 16:50.653
I would infinitely rather
go have a great bowl

16:50.654 --> 16:52.721
of pho at the local
Vietnamese place

16:52.722 --> 16:57.130
than a five-course $300
dinner at some fancy place.

16:59.130 --> 17:00.763
You know, we can only
go out to eat

17:00.764 --> 17:02.331
so many times a year.

17:02.332 --> 17:04.633
We can only get
so many haircuts a year.

17:04.634 --> 17:07.604
We can only get...
I can, you know...

17:07.605 --> 17:09.471
Three pairs of jeans
will do you, you know?

17:09.472 --> 17:11.175
Like, you don't need 300 pairs.

17:13.175 --> 17:15.178
The problem isn't that the rich

17:15.179 --> 17:17.046
spend too much
of what they earn.

17:17.047 --> 17:20.349
It's actually, paradoxically,
that they spend too little.

17:20.351 --> 17:23.154
They're not generating
enough economic activity.

17:25.154 --> 17:27.390
Somebody earning
$10 million a year

17:27.391 --> 17:30.293
doesn't spend $10 million.

17:30.294 --> 17:31.826
They save it.

17:31.827 --> 17:34.797
And those savings go
anywhere around the world.

17:34.798 --> 17:39.135
They can make the most money,
get the highest return.

17:39.136 --> 17:42.838
They become part
of the global capital market,

17:42.839 --> 17:45.274
including a lot
of speculative instruments,

17:45.275 --> 17:48.178
having gold and real estate
and anything else

17:48.179 --> 17:50.747
that they're all chasing.

17:50.748 --> 17:55.317
With the exception of the
money I personally invest

17:55.318 --> 17:59.221
to start companies,
I have essentially no idea

17:59.222 --> 18:00.990
what happens to my money.

18:00.991 --> 18:03.993
I invest in funds of funds,

18:03.994 --> 18:08.097
and those hedge funds
do God knows what with it.

18:08.098 --> 18:10.700
But I do believe absolutely

18:10.701 --> 18:13.702
that most of the return
that's being created

18:13.703 --> 18:17.073
isn't creating
any kind of social utility

18:17.074 --> 18:20.175
other than creating
a return for me.

18:20.176 --> 18:22.178
Now, ordinarily we like saving.

18:22.179 --> 18:24.046
I mean, savings are good,
but when we have

18:24.047 --> 18:27.683
so much unemployment,
so much underutilized capacity

18:27.684 --> 18:31.822
here in the United States,
we need spending.

18:31.823 --> 18:37.259
Every single person there has
to process 12 units per hour.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.496
How are we gonna create jobs
if you're taxing

18:39.497 --> 18:41.698
the very successful people
in America

18:41.699 --> 18:43.399
who provide those jobs?

18:43.400 --> 18:46.568
Sometimes we think
that this is a debate

18:46.569 --> 18:48.970
over facts and figures
and data.

18:48.971 --> 18:52.409
To raise taxes on the job
creators in this country...

18:52.410 --> 18:53.709
I think if you believe that,

18:53.710 --> 18:55.444
you're fooling yourself
a little bit.

18:55.445 --> 18:58.448
The people that you call rich,
I call job creators.

18:58.449 --> 19:00.783
When somebody calls
themselves a job creator,

19:00.784 --> 19:03.419
they're not describing
the economy

19:03.420 --> 19:04.787
or how the economy works,

19:04.788 --> 19:06.722
although that's
what it sounds like.

19:06.723 --> 19:09.592
What they're really doing
is making a claim

19:09.593 --> 19:13.364
on status, privileges,
and power.

19:14.364 --> 19:16.731
If a guy like me
is a job creator

19:16.732 --> 19:18.800
at the center
of the economic universe,

19:18.801 --> 19:21.971
the current
economic arrangements

19:21.972 --> 19:25.208
are righteous and justified.

19:25.209 --> 19:26.976
I know how comfortable
this is to believe

19:26.977 --> 19:29.545
because I used to believe it.

19:29.546 --> 19:31.914
You know, I grew up
kind of believing that.

19:31.915 --> 19:34.316
You know, and when people
challenged that idea,

19:34.317 --> 19:35.751
I would say things like,

19:35.752 --> 19:37.886
"Well, you just don't
understand economics."

19:37.887 --> 19:39.889
(LAUGHS)

19:39.890 --> 19:42.659
But of course,
if rich business guys like me

19:42.660 --> 19:44.960
are not job creators...
it's actually our customers

19:44.961 --> 19:46.496
that are the job creators...

19:46.497 --> 19:49.265
we are not the center
of the economic universe.

19:49.266 --> 19:50.536
They are.

19:52.536 --> 19:56.338
We need to replace
trickle-down economics

19:56.339 --> 19:58.741
with middle-out economics.

19:58.742 --> 20:02.644
And, indeed,
every place you look on Earth

20:02.645 --> 20:06.548
where you find prosperity,
you finds massive investments

20:06.549 --> 20:08.317
in the middle class
and the poor,

20:08.318 --> 20:12.854
because at the end of the day,
they are the true job creators.

20:12.855 --> 20:15.758
The most pro-business thing
you can do

20:15.759 --> 20:19.394
is to help middle-class
people thrive.

20:50.394 --> 20:53.395
Okay, I'm gonna get the box.

20:53.396 --> 20:57.633
Now, see, this box
is really important.

20:57.634 --> 20:59.935
I travel not only
with my MINI Cooper

20:59.936 --> 21:01.903
but with my box.

21:01.904 --> 21:04.207
(HUMMING)

21:04.208 --> 21:05.608
Hello, George.
How are you?

21:05.609 --> 21:07.143
You are so kind
to bring the box.

21:07.144 --> 21:08.510
We have one for you too.

21:08.511 --> 21:09.745
It's the same room and...

21:09.746 --> 21:11.047
In recent years,
I've discovered

21:11.048 --> 21:14.217
that I actually have
a very, very rare

21:14.218 --> 21:16.585
genetic condition.

21:16.586 --> 21:18.854
It's Fairbanks Syndrome

21:18.855 --> 21:22.324
that is responsible
for me being very short.

21:22.325 --> 21:25.393
Hey, Bob, let me carry that.
No, no, no, that's fine.

21:25.394 --> 21:27.630
My parents were normal size.

21:27.631 --> 21:29.732
My grandmother
always said to me,

21:29.733 --> 21:31.367
"Don't worry,"
'cause when I hit

21:31.368 --> 21:34.738
about 10 or 11 or 12,
I'm gonna,

21:34.739 --> 21:37.573
you know,
have a real growth spurt.

21:37.574 --> 21:39.541
And then I got to be
about 10, 11,

21:39.542 --> 21:41.576
and nothing happened, you know?

21:41.577 --> 21:42.945
Right up this way to the right.

21:42.946 --> 21:43.979
Right this way.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.413
Yup, behind you.

21:45.414 --> 21:48.765
(APPLAUSE)

22:01.765 --> 22:04.467
I grew up in the shadow
of World War II.

22:04.468 --> 22:08.136
My father was in the war.

22:08.137 --> 22:10.105
We were middle-class.

22:10.106 --> 22:13.144
My father sold dresses.
My mother helped in the shop.

22:15.144 --> 22:19.147
My first job in Washington
was working as a summer intern

22:19.148 --> 22:22.719
for Robert Kennedy.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.454
It was a time when there
were kind of giants.

22:25.455 --> 22:28.391
Robert F. Kennedy,
Martin Luther King,

22:28.392 --> 22:31.559
they were all
trying to change society.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.997
There was a sense
of possibility.

22:33.998 --> 22:37.232
It kind of turned me on
to politics.

22:37.233 --> 22:40.635
A few years later, I was
picked to be a Rhodes Scholar.

22:40.636 --> 22:42.904
In those days,
all the Rhodes Scholars

22:42.905 --> 22:45.946
who were selected
took a boat to England.

22:50.946 --> 22:53.582
The problem was, you know,
when you go over there,

22:53.583 --> 22:57.120
the Atlantic Ocean
is pretty rough.

22:57.121 --> 23:00.021
You know, I and most
of the other Rhodes Scholars

23:00.022 --> 23:02.892
were sick,
and I went down to my cabin.

23:02.893 --> 23:04.531
You know,
I thought I was gonna die.

23:08.531 --> 23:10.665
And then there was a knock
on the door,

23:10.666 --> 23:12.701
and this fellow was there,

23:12.702 --> 23:15.004
this kind of tall,
gangly Southerner,

23:15.005 --> 23:17.306
and he had chicken soup
in one hand

23:17.307 --> 23:19.374
and crackers in the other,

23:19.375 --> 23:21.743
and he said, "I hear
you aren't feeling too well.

23:21.744 --> 23:23.278
"I thought these might help.

23:23.279 --> 23:26.149
My name is Bill Clinton."

23:26.150 --> 23:28.550
At Oxford,
we were at the same college.

23:28.551 --> 23:30.556
We kept in touch.

23:32.556 --> 23:34.958
At Oxford,
I studied mostly economics

23:34.959 --> 23:37.326
and philosophy.

23:37.327 --> 23:40.595
But those experiences
really were a study for me

23:40.596 --> 23:43.232
of the rules by which
markets are organized.

23:43.233 --> 23:44.767
And this is an important point,

23:44.768 --> 23:47.903
and it's one
that's very often lost,

23:47.904 --> 23:51.339
but it was the focus
of my attention.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.608
You see, there's no such thing

23:52.609 --> 23:55.044
as a perfectly free market
anywhere.

23:55.045 --> 24:00.016
Government sets the rules
by which the market functions.

24:00.017 --> 24:02.885
All of these rules
are necessary

24:02.886 --> 24:06.889
in order to construct
a free market.

24:06.890 --> 24:10.526
The real question is,
who do these rules benefit

24:10.527 --> 24:12.760
and who do they hurt?

24:12.761 --> 24:15.130
And in the last 30 years,

24:15.131 --> 24:18.201
as the structure of the
economy began to shift,

24:18.202 --> 24:20.769
many of the rules
governing our market

24:20.770 --> 24:23.009
began to shift as well.

24:26.009 --> 24:28.411
Today we're going
to try to explain

24:28.412 --> 24:34.616
the mystery of why inequality
has been widening.

24:34.617 --> 24:37.586
Remember, the economy is
growing all of this time.

24:37.587 --> 24:38.787
The economy is...

24:38.788 --> 24:40.789
The economy continues to grow.

24:40.790 --> 24:43.258
Look, here is
gross domestic product growth

24:43.259 --> 24:46.261
from 1929 to 2011.

24:46.262 --> 24:49.565
The economy overall
has done extremely well,

24:49.566 --> 24:51.933
and productivity
keeps on increasing.

24:51.934 --> 24:54.269
We are producing
more and more and more

24:54.270 --> 24:55.738
and more and more value.

24:55.739 --> 24:58.007
That's a big, big
success story.

24:58.008 --> 25:00.041
But here is the problem.
Here's the puzzle.

25:00.042 --> 25:02.845
Because if you look at the
average hourly earnings

25:02.846 --> 25:04.614
of production workers,

25:04.615 --> 25:09.050
the average hourly earning
continued to rise

25:09.051 --> 25:15.191
until the late 1970s,
and then something happened,

(FUNKY MUSIC)

25:38.548 --> 25:40.516
In the late 1970s,

25:40.517 --> 25:43.251
I was at the Federal
Trade Commission.

25:43.252 --> 25:45.453
I was looking at
a lot of studies

25:45.454 --> 25:50.191
about the direction that
the economy was going in.

25:50.192 --> 25:53.796
More of American manufacturing
was beginning to move abroad.

25:53.797 --> 25:59.133
There was the beginnings
of a technological revolution.

25:59.134 --> 26:03.105
Financial markets were becoming
a little bit more powerful.

26:03.106 --> 26:05.844
There was a move to deregulate.

26:07.844 --> 26:10.479
Well, you connect the dots,
and all of these

26:10.480 --> 26:14.851
begin to look as if
they're connected somehow

26:14.852 --> 26:17.624
to this widening inequality.

26:20.624 --> 26:24.727
For example, we knew that
labor unions were declining.

26:24.728 --> 26:27.864
And that decline mirrored
almost exactly

26:27.865 --> 26:29.931
the decline
in the middle class' share

26:29.932 --> 26:32.401
of national income.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.875
Many people, even to this day,

26:40.876 --> 26:44.614
say that the decline of unions
really was attributable

26:44.615 --> 26:49.352
to Ronald Reagan taking on

to report for duty this morning,

26:55.392 --> 27:00.262
they have forfeited their
jobs and will be terminated.

27:00.263 --> 27:03.499
There's no question that
beginning in the late '70s

27:03.500 --> 27:07.769
but also after Reagan fired
the air traffic controllers,

27:07.770 --> 27:14.277
there was a major assault
on unions.

27:14.278 --> 27:18.181
Employers did try to prevent
unions from being formed

27:18.182 --> 27:20.382

than before...

You don't have to hang on to me.

27:22.987 --> 27:26.322

to bust unions

also many companies abroad.

was two interrelated things:

29:46.730 --> 29:48.329
cost of wages or labor.

It's also which country's
workers add what value.

means less and less
in this new global economy.

like cargo ships, containers,

30:07.951 --> 30:10.419
satellite communication
technologies,

30:10.420 --> 30:13.154
and eventually
computers and the internet,

30:13.155 --> 30:16.893
these technologies enabled
the production process

30:16.894 --> 30:20.162
to be parceled out
around the world.

30:20.163 --> 30:22.831
Large numbers of American
manufacturing workers

30:22.832 --> 30:25.701
began to lose their jobs,

30:25.702 --> 30:29.136
which meant it inevitably
began undercutting

30:29.137 --> 30:33.010
the wages of a lot
of working Americans.

30:35.010 --> 30:37.312
Even factories remaining
in the United States

30:37.313 --> 30:40.787
shed workers as they automated.

30:43.787 --> 30:45.954
And we have this romantic idea

30:45.955 --> 30:48.022
that we can get
manufacturing back.

30:48.023 --> 30:50.124
But you get manufacturing
plants back,

30:50.125 --> 30:52.126
and they're filled
with robots and computers.

30:52.127 --> 30:54.697
The old assembly line is gone.

30:54.698 --> 30:58.768
I was one of the earliest
investors in amazon.com.

30:58.769 --> 31:02.904
I consider amazon.com
to be one of the greatest

31:02.905 --> 31:05.106
economic achievements
of our time

31:05.107 --> 31:08.778
and certainly something
I'm incredibly proud of.

31:08.779 --> 31:15.616
But make no mistake:
amazon.com employs 60,000 people

31:15.617 --> 31:20.489
and does $70 billion,
$80 billion in sales.

31:20.490 --> 31:22.624
But if mom-and-pop retailers
were doing

31:22.625 --> 31:26.027
that $70 billion or
$80 billion in sales,

31:26.028 --> 31:28.497
it would be 60,000 people
employed doing it.

31:28.498 --> 31:32.567
It'd be 600,000 or 800,000
or a million people

31:32.568 --> 31:38.172
because those business models
are so much less efficient.

31:38.173 --> 31:41.710
So Amazon created
a huge economic windfall

31:41.711 --> 31:43.711
here in the Pacific Northwest,

31:43.712 --> 31:45.914
but all over the country,

31:45.915 --> 31:48.150
there are people
who are no longer employed

31:48.151 --> 31:51.890
in selling stuff
who are not happy.

31:53.890 --> 31:55.624
As a manager for Circuit City,

31:55.625 --> 31:59.361
it was a look behind
the curtain, so to speak,

31:59.362 --> 32:03.531
as a manager, to see exactly
how everything worked.

32:03.532 --> 32:05.901
So when you got laid off,
did you see it coming,

32:05.902 --> 32:07.536
or was it sudden?

32:07.537 --> 32:11.106
They did several layoffs
while I was there.

32:11.107 --> 32:12.908
People who had been there too long:

32:12.909 --> 32:14.677
"They're making too much money

32:14.678 --> 32:16.577
"because they've
been there too long,

32:16.578 --> 32:21.450
and we're gonna have to do
something to cut the payroll."

32:21.451 --> 32:25.491
The hardest part was thinking,
"Is it gonna happen to me?"

32:29.491 --> 32:31.360
Until I became a student,
it was pretty dicey.

32:31.361 --> 32:32.894
I mean, it would have been
easy for me

32:32.895 --> 32:34.997
to just fall into depression,

32:34.998 --> 32:36.499
which happens
to a lot of people,

32:36.500 --> 32:39.067
or go for a lower-paying job,
which would have

32:39.068 --> 32:43.074
put me in a worse
financial situation.

32:45.074 --> 32:49.678
Looking back on it,
you can see the pattern.

32:49.679 --> 32:52.014
It's not as easy to see
when you're in it,

32:52.015 --> 32:53.481
but the signs were there.

32:53.482 --> 32:58.720
I mean, there was
a major slowdown in business,

32:58.721 --> 33:00.556
and I think a lot of that
had to do

33:00.557 --> 33:03.758
with things like Amazon.

33:03.759 --> 33:06.961
Because I've been in retail
for so long,

33:06.962 --> 33:10.198
I don't go through
the automated checkout lines.

33:10.199 --> 33:12.366
And one of the main reasons
is because I know

33:12.367 --> 33:14.269
that every time
I go through that,

33:14.270 --> 33:17.974
it's taking a little bit
of someone's job away.

33:18.974 --> 33:21.308
It's not that I think
that I'm going to...

33:21.309 --> 33:23.746
save their jobs
in the long run.

33:23.747 --> 33:25.448
But I know
that I'm gonna slow down

33:25.449 --> 33:28.717
the transition a little bit
so that maybe

33:28.718 --> 33:31.252
they're gonna have
a little bit longer

33:31.253 --> 33:33.127
to get ready for the transition.

33:39.127 --> 33:41.096
Contrary to popular mythology,

33:41.097 --> 33:44.100
globalization and technology
haven't really

33:44.101 --> 33:46.701
reduced the number of jobs
available to Americans.

33:46.702 --> 33:51.586
These transformations
have reduced their pay.

34:02.586 --> 34:05.187
I mean, it's not just
that wages are stagnating,

34:05.188 --> 34:07.655
but when you take
into consideration

34:07.656 --> 34:09.391
rising costs...

34:09.393 --> 34:13.129
the rising costs of rents
or homes,

34:13.130 --> 34:16.297
dramatically increasing costs
of health care,

34:16.297 --> 34:18.667
the rising costs of child care,

34:18.668 --> 34:21.569
and also the rising costs
or higher education,

34:21.570 --> 34:24.605
rising much faster
than inflation...

34:24.606 --> 34:27.141
Take all of these
into consideration,

34:27.143 --> 34:28.509
and you find
that it's much worse

34:28.510 --> 34:30.645
than just stagnating wages.

34:30.646 --> 34:33.882
It's basically
middle-class families,

34:33.884 --> 34:35.484
often with two wage earners,

34:35.485 --> 34:38.020
working harder and harder
and harder

34:38.021 --> 34:40.393
and getting nowhere.

34:43.393 --> 34:49.031
I work at a law firm
as a litigation assistant.

34:49.032 --> 34:50.899
And Moises?

34:50.900 --> 34:54.402
I work as a bus operator.

34:54.404 --> 34:57.573

your bank account right now?

34:57.574 --> 34:59.475
Mine is less than 100 bucks.

34:59.476 --> 35:02.576
So I want to say maybe $80.

35:02.577 --> 35:05.080
Yeah, yesterday
it was only $30.

35:05.081 --> 35:07.015
(LAUGHTER)

35:07.016 --> 35:08.183
And that's with us working.

35:08.184 --> 35:09.484

Car insurance, $125.

35:11.221 --> 35:13.221
Kids' World, $150.

35:13.222 --> 35:15.758
Rent, $1,375.

35:15.759 --> 35:18.259
We felt like we had
to write it all down,

35:18.260 --> 35:20.662
because how could we
not have money?

35:20.663 --> 35:21.562
We make money.

35:21.563 --> 35:23.332
You know, I'm working now.

35:23.333 --> 35:26.067
We don't know how much we're
gonna be paying on that.

35:26.068 --> 35:27.502
The Y.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.171
This is my money that I donate.

35:29.172 --> 35:32.306
$16 a month
to Children International.

35:32.307 --> 35:36.578
We don't even have here
my UCSF bill.

35:36.579 --> 35:38.647
Remember that hospital bill?

35:38.648 --> 35:40.348
It's, like,
200 and something dollars

35:40.349 --> 35:42.017
that's not even here
that we need to pay.

35:42.018 --> 35:43.317
Oh, yeah.

35:43.318 --> 35:45.654
What about savings?

35:45.655 --> 35:47.122
We haven't been able to.

35:47.123 --> 35:49.723
We don't have
a savings account.

35:49.724 --> 35:53.528
I took it off because it...
It wasn't working.

35:53.529 --> 35:54.562
(LAUGHS)

35:54.563 --> 35:57.433
Oh, you brought your glove.

35:57.434 --> 35:59.100
Did you guys play baseball?

35:59.101 --> 36:01.035
And she's been playing with you?

36:01.036 --> 36:02.971
When she was born,
we had no money.

36:02.972 --> 36:05.841
The refrigerator was empty.
The freezer was empty.

36:05.842 --> 36:08.009
I said, "This is not the way
I want to raise my daughter."

36:08.010 --> 36:10.812
How was your day?
Good.

36:10.813 --> 36:14.549
I've seen single mothers
work three jobs

36:14.550 --> 36:18.252
just to be able to pay rent.

36:18.253 --> 36:20.020
And I didn't want that.

36:20.021 --> 36:21.527
So I started going to school.

36:24.527 --> 36:27.495
How do you build wealth?

36:27.496 --> 36:29.263
Not that I want to be wealthy.

36:29.264 --> 36:30.265
I just...

36:30.266 --> 36:31.834
How do you do it?

36:31.835 --> 36:33.401
How the heck
do you build wealth,

36:33.402 --> 36:35.203
like, when you don't
have anything,

36:35.204 --> 36:38.439
when you don't have any assets,
when you don't have nothing?

36:38.440 --> 36:41.310
This is gonna be Mommy's office.
Look.

36:41.311 --> 36:43.312
This is gonna be my office.

36:43.313 --> 36:44.812
It's not my office yet,

36:44.813 --> 36:47.915
but it's going to be
my office really soon.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.218
Hmm?

36:49.219 --> 36:50.785
People, I think,
would be less concerned

36:50.786 --> 36:53.455
about inequality
of income and wealth

36:53.456 --> 36:56.692
if everybody had a chance
to make it.

36:56.693 --> 36:58.493
As long as there's
upward mobility,

36:58.494 --> 37:01.796
as long as anybody
with enough guts and gumption

37:01.797 --> 37:04.332
and hard work
can make it in America,

37:04.333 --> 37:09.605
can move up the income ladder,
then we don't have a problem.

37:09.606 --> 37:12.908
But as income inequality rises,

37:12.909 --> 37:16.712
upward mobility is actually
less than it was before.

37:16.713 --> 37:18.245
Come on.
You want to see the rest?

37:18.246 --> 37:20.547
Yeah.

37:20.548 --> 37:24.419
In the United States,
42% of kids born into poverty

37:24.420 --> 37:26.154
will not get out.

37:26.155 --> 37:27.723
Compare that to Denmark,

37:27.724 --> 37:31.794
where only 25% of kids
born into poverty stay there.

37:31.795 --> 37:33.160
Even Great Britain,

37:33.161 --> 37:35.796
a country that still has
an aristocracy,

37:35.797 --> 37:38.503
has more upward mobility
than we do.

37:40.503 --> 37:43.471
You know, people
occasionally say to me,

37:43.472 --> 37:47.642
"Okay, Reich, if you think
it can be done better,

37:47.643 --> 37:49.944
"what nation does it better?

37:49.945 --> 37:52.446
Whom should we emulate?"

37:52.447 --> 37:55.417
And the answer is

37:55.418 --> 37:56.389
the United States.

38:01.389 --> 38:04.459
In the three decades
after World War II,

38:04.460 --> 38:07.062
a period that I call
"the Great Prosperity,"

38:07.063 --> 38:08.997
the economy boomed,

38:08.998 --> 38:11.033
but not only
did the economy boom,

38:11.034 --> 38:14.472
but you had very low inequality.

38:16.472 --> 38:19.306
We made education
a national priority,

38:19.307 --> 38:22.776
particularly higher education.

38:22.777 --> 38:26.147
By 1940,
only 5% of adult Americans

38:26.148 --> 38:27.982
had a four-year college degree,

38:27.983 --> 38:31.289
but that percentage
began to explode.

38:34.289 --> 38:36.225
The GI Bill paid college costs

38:36.226 --> 38:37.792
for those who returned
from war,

38:37.793 --> 38:40.796
and the subsequent expansion
of public universities

38:40.797 --> 38:44.899
made higher education
affordable to many.

38:44.900 --> 38:49.038
By the late '50s, we had
the best-educated workforce

38:49.039 --> 38:51.073
of any country in the world.

38:51.074 --> 38:52.306
(GAVEL POUNDING)

38:52.307 --> 38:54.679
We also had labor unions.

38:56.679 --> 39:00.381
By the mid-1950s,
more than 1/3 of all workers

39:00.382 --> 39:02.917
belonged to a union.

39:02.918 --> 39:05.421
This gave average workers
bargaining leverage

39:05.422 --> 39:08.689
to get a larger share
of the growing pie.

39:08.690 --> 39:11.292
We created
the largest middle class

39:11.293 --> 39:12.826
the world had ever seen.

39:12.827 --> 39:17.487
And that middle class
was part of a virtuous cycle.

39:38.487 --> 39:40.254
The wider their prosperity,

39:40.255 --> 39:42.957
the more people were included
in that prosperity,

39:42.958 --> 39:45.137
the more that prosperity
generated more prosperity.

39:54.137 --> 39:55.541
Hello.

39:59.541 --> 40:03.278
Okay, now,

40:03.279 --> 40:07.716
they're gonna be calling in
momentarily.

40:07.717 --> 40:09.616
From American Public Media,

40:09.617 --> 40:12.319
this is <i> Marketplace.</i>

40:12.320 --> 40:16.725
(UPBEAT PERCUSSIVE MUSIC)

40:16.726 --> 40:18.560
America's already
making it harder

40:18.561 --> 40:21.163
for young people of modest
means to attend college.

40:21.164 --> 40:24.598
41 states are cutting spending
for public higher education,

40:24.599 --> 40:27.806
and tuition and fees
are rising as a result.

40:30.806 --> 40:32.839
One of the things we've
learned about inequality

40:32.840 --> 40:35.776
is that it's clearly
linked to education,

40:35.777 --> 40:39.214
including higher education.

40:39.215 --> 40:41.883
More than anything else,
that's what lifted people

40:41.884 --> 40:43.685
out of poverty
and into the middle class

40:43.686 --> 40:45.854
during the Great Prosperity.

40:45.855 --> 40:48.089
But starting in the late 1970s,

40:48.090 --> 40:51.197
our college graduation rates
began to flatten out.

40:55.197 --> 40:58.033
Countries that kept focusing
on higher education

40:58.034 --> 41:00.767
were able to deal
with globalization better

41:00.768 --> 41:03.937
by creating
a highly skilled workforce.

41:03.938 --> 41:06.040
Look at South Korea.
Look at the Netherlands.

41:06.041 --> 41:08.343
Look at Germany.

41:08.344 --> 41:11.212
They've invested
substantially in education,

41:11.213 --> 41:15.582
in skill building
of all of their workers.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.017
Even though their wages
are high,

41:17.018 --> 41:18.752
it's worth it to make stuff

41:18.753 --> 41:21.156
that goes into the iPhone
from Germany

41:21.157 --> 41:25.627
because it is so well made
and is so precise.

41:25.628 --> 41:27.761
Basically, every other
industrialized country...

41:27.762 --> 41:30.966
Japan, Germany, France...
they are investing per capita

41:30.967 --> 41:34.335
much more public investment
in all of the areas:

41:34.336 --> 41:36.571
roads, bridges,
public education.

41:36.572 --> 41:37.671
That's what we're not doing.

41:37.672 --> 41:38.872
That's what we have to be doing.

41:38.873 --> 41:40.207
We're almost out of time.

41:40.208 --> 41:41.676
We can't do it,
not with new tech.

41:41.677 --> 41:43.310
For years, I have been writing

41:43.311 --> 41:45.680
about the importance
of investing in people,

41:45.681 --> 41:48.383
in our workforce, so that
our people could compete

41:48.384 --> 41:50.954
in this new global economy.

41:51.954 --> 41:55.589
And then in 1992,
I thought I finally

41:55.590 --> 41:57.991
might be able
to do something about it.

41:57.992 --> 42:01.029
Today I proudly announce
my candidacy

42:01.030 --> 42:03.665
for president of the
United States of America.

42:03.666 --> 42:05.933
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

42:05.934 --> 42:09.404
Bill Clinton told me
he had read all my books.

42:09.405 --> 42:10.904
They must have influenced him,

42:10.905 --> 42:14.676
because it formed the
backbone of his 1992 campaign

42:14.677 --> 42:16.977
about putting people first.

42:16.978 --> 42:19.046
If you put people first,
if you do what works,

42:19.047 --> 42:21.316
what we know works
in the global economy,

42:21.317 --> 42:23.919
you'll do what the Germans do;
you'll do what the Japanese do.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.053
You'll put your people first.

42:25.054 --> 42:26.955
You'll expand the middle class.

42:26.956 --> 42:29.357
I mean, here was, you know,
somebody I'd known

42:29.358 --> 42:32.493
from the age of 22,
and he called me one day

42:32.494 --> 42:35.663
and said, "Look, Bob,
what I really want you to do

42:35.664 --> 42:37.799
"is come down to Washington
right now.

42:37.800 --> 42:41.468
I need you to run the
economic transition team."

42:41.469 --> 42:44.476
I didn't even know what an
economic transition team was.

42:48.476 --> 42:52.881
You can't imagine the
headiness, the excitement.

42:52.882 --> 42:56.618
I mean, the chance
to actually take these ideas,

42:56.619 --> 42:59.220
put them into practice...

42:59.221 --> 43:02.756
I named my economic plan
Putting People First

43:02.757 --> 43:04.759
to highlight my belief
that our nation

43:04.760 --> 43:08.196
can only become a high-wage,
high-growth economy

43:08.197 --> 43:11.700
if we make a commitment to
invest in the American people

43:11.701 --> 43:14.535
to make the American economy
prosper.

43:14.536 --> 43:18.506
That is why I'm naming today
one of my most trusted advisors

43:18.507 --> 43:20.008
and closest friends

43:20.009 --> 43:22.047
to the position
of secretary of labor.

43:25.047 --> 43:28.216
Well, modesty aside,
I have assumed for months

43:28.217 --> 43:31.051
that I was on Bill Clinton's
short list.

43:31.052 --> 43:32.986
You can step up on that, Bob.
There is a step.

43:32.987 --> 43:35.524
Oh, there is a step here.
Okay.

43:35.525 --> 43:37.459
It was a dream job

43:37.460 --> 43:40.794
for somebody like me,
who had worried about

43:40.795 --> 43:43.631
and fretted about
and studied and taught about

43:43.632 --> 43:45.600
and wrote about
what was happening

43:45.601 --> 43:48.102
to the American workforce
for years.

43:48.103 --> 43:51.038
That long decline
in median wages...

43:51.039 --> 43:52.841
the wage of that person
smack in the middle

43:52.842 --> 43:55.776
of the wage scale...
that decline started in 1978.

43:55.777 --> 43:57.278
Those wages began to decline

43:57.279 --> 43:59.379
in terms of the real purchasing
power of the dollar...

43:59.380 --> 44:01.850
You know, on the one side,
it was pretty clear

44:01.851 --> 44:05.854
that wages were flat
for most people.

44:05.855 --> 44:08.489
The flip side was that
some people in this country

44:08.490 --> 44:10.032
were doing extraordinarily well.

44:17.032 --> 44:19.232
You see,
the same new technologies

44:19.233 --> 44:21.870
that brought globalization
and automation

44:21.871 --> 44:24.738
bestowed ever larger rewards
on people

44:24.739 --> 44:27.642
who had the right education
and connections

44:27.643 --> 44:29.347
to take advantage
of globalization.

44:32.347 --> 44:34.549
Some people say to me,
"But wait a minute.

44:34.550 --> 44:37.986
You've got technologies today
that you didn't have in 1980."

44:37.987 --> 44:40.254
You know, we didn't have
flat-screen televisions.

44:40.255 --> 44:42.522
We didn't have
low-cost air travel.

44:42.523 --> 44:44.225
We didn't have Skype.

44:44.226 --> 44:47.127
We didn't have the internet.

44:47.128 --> 44:49.062
So who are
the winners and losers

44:49.063 --> 44:52.634
from this great shift?

44:52.635 --> 44:54.868
Consumers certainly are winning.

44:54.869 --> 44:57.538
I mean, you guys, as consumers,

44:57.539 --> 44:58.874
you are doing very well.

44:58.875 --> 45:01.207
You get wonderful products.

45:01.208 --> 45:05.212
Almost everything you're
buying is getting cheaper,

45:05.213 --> 45:08.216
and the investors
are doing well.

45:08.217 --> 45:12.687
Here is a chart showing
the rise and fall

45:12.688 --> 45:14.723
of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.

45:14.724 --> 45:17.459
You can see something here.

45:17.460 --> 45:19.326
There is sort of a pattern.

45:19.327 --> 45:20.361
Whoo!

45:20.362 --> 45:21.562
(LAUGHTER)

45:21.563 --> 45:24.198
You see, something happened,

45:24.199 --> 45:28.803
and I think it happened
starting right in these years.

45:28.804 --> 45:31.839
(LAUGHTER)

45:31.840 --> 45:34.975
You see these were the...

45:34.976 --> 45:37.779
years I was labor secretary.

45:37.780 --> 45:40.647
And investors got very excited.

45:40.648 --> 45:42.584
(LAUGHTER)

45:42.585 --> 45:43.817
I mean, we all saw

45:43.818 --> 45:45.986
the stock market
going like this.

45:45.987 --> 45:47.022
I mean, how...

45:47.023 --> 45:48.489
What in the world was going on?

45:48.490 --> 45:49.957
How could that be possible?

45:49.958 --> 45:53.463
Were companies suddenly
that much more profitable?

45:55.463 --> 45:57.297
One of the big reasons
corporations

45:57.298 --> 46:02.069
were showing higher profits is,
they were keeping pay down.

46:02.070 --> 46:04.437
At the same time,
corporate CEOs

46:04.438 --> 46:07.308
were starting to pay
themselves large multiples

46:07.309 --> 46:09.544
of what the average worker
was earning.

46:09.545 --> 46:12.113
When we, in the fourth
quarter of last year,

46:12.114 --> 46:13.913
along with a number
of other companies,

46:13.914 --> 46:16.984
has to consider
workforce reductions,

46:16.985 --> 46:18.953
it was a difficult time.

46:18.954 --> 46:22.357
You knew that you
were impacting people

46:22.358 --> 46:25.426
who would have a difficult
time, many of them,

46:25.427 --> 46:27.995
in finding new jobs,
but you had to do it

46:27.996 --> 46:34.804
for the organization to,
in that day, look to survive.

46:35.804 --> 46:39.006
This chart shows you
the compensation

46:39.007 --> 46:43.444
of the highest-paid
executives in 2010.

46:43.445 --> 46:46.948
These executives are being
paid a lot of money.

46:46.949 --> 46:50.116
Executive pay keeps going up.

46:50.117 --> 46:53.254
Here's the ratio
of average CEO compensation

46:53.255 --> 46:55.122
to the average worker's pay.

46:55.123 --> 47:00.294
Suddenly this ratio
goes kablooey.

47:00.295 --> 47:04.966
Bill Clinton in 1992,
one of his campaign planks

47:04.967 --> 47:07.435
was that no company
should be able

47:07.436 --> 47:10.171
to deduct the cost
of executive compensation

47:10.172 --> 47:11.772
in excess of $1 million.

47:11.773 --> 47:15.042
Many big corporate executives
raised their own salaries

47:15.043 --> 47:17.243
even when their companies
were losing money

47:17.244 --> 47:20.848
and their workers were being put
into the unemployment lines.

47:20.849 --> 47:23.283
I expect the jet-setters
and the featherbedders

47:23.284 --> 47:26.254
of corporate America to know
that if you sell your companies

47:26.255 --> 47:28.221
and your workers and your
country down the river,

47:28.222 --> 47:29.890
you'll be called on the carpet.

47:29.891 --> 47:33.026
That's what the president's
bully pulpit is for.

47:33.027 --> 47:34.595
When it came
to actually implementing it,

47:34.596 --> 47:38.332
the Treasury Department decided
that as long as CEO pay

47:38.333 --> 47:40.868
was linked
to company performance,

47:40.869 --> 47:43.504
you could deduct pay
over $1 million.

47:43.505 --> 47:47.341
Well, that was the signal
to a lot of executives

47:47.342 --> 47:51.412
and to their boards of directors
to make more and more

47:51.413 --> 47:54.316
of executive pay
into stock options.

47:54.317 --> 47:57.218
That's where the whole
stock option thing came from.

47:57.219 --> 48:00.221
It was kind of a perversion
of Bill Clinton's promise

48:00.222 --> 48:02.559
in the 1992 election.

48:04.559 --> 48:06.694
Another result of all of this
is that you get

48:06.695 --> 48:11.431
the third group of people who
are doing remarkably well.

48:11.432 --> 48:13.535
They're the people
who always do well,

48:13.536 --> 48:16.604
particularly in times
of high inequality:

48:16.605 --> 48:17.872
the financiers.

48:17.873 --> 48:20.808
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

48:20.809 --> 48:23.611
Between 1997 and 2007,

48:23.612 --> 48:27.582
finance was the fastest-growing
part of the American economy.

48:27.583 --> 48:30.651
In 2009, during the depths
of the recession,

48:30.652 --> 48:34.654
the seven highest-paid
hedge fund managers

48:34.655 --> 48:37.927
were taking in
more than $1 billion each.

48:39.927 --> 48:42.363
Remember that government
sets the rules

48:42.364 --> 48:44.737
by which the market functions.

48:47.737 --> 48:50.171
We deregulated Wall Street,

48:50.172 --> 48:52.306
allowing Wall Street to engage

48:52.307 --> 48:55.047
in more and more excessive
behavior.

48:59.047 --> 49:01.482
These are
the financial sector wages

49:01.483 --> 49:03.219
relative to everyone else's.

49:05.219 --> 49:07.520
Does this graph look familiar?

49:07.521 --> 49:09.957
I mean, this is

with our religion too,

okay, Mormons.

49:56.838 --> 49:58.305
The majority
of the Mormons are.

There are those rare Democrats,

50:00.442 --> 50:02.276
but the majority of them
are Republicans.

Oh, I called them,
but you know what it is?

as someone

cutting back on people

50:41.282 --> 50:44.551
Well, the operation
will be more profitable

50:44.552 --> 50:47.687
if they cut back on personnel.

Some people walked out.

51:23.559 --> 51:25.959
There was tension in the air.

51:25.960 --> 51:28.162
The underlying reality

51:28.163 --> 51:29.997
is that if workers
don't have power,

51:29.998 --> 51:32.066
if they don't have a voice,

51:32.067 --> 51:36.437
inevitably their wages
and benefits start eroding.

51:36.438 --> 51:38.872
It happens inevitably.

I'm a proud Christian.

I think they treat me more fair

51:46.014 --> 51:47.582
than I should be treated.

51:47.583 --> 51:52.419
If you have a company that is
dependent on shareholders,

51:52.420 --> 51:56.056
there is growing and growing
pressure on that company

51:56.057 --> 51:57.457
to show better
and better profits

51:57.458 --> 51:59.259
and have higher and higher
share prices.

51:59.260 --> 52:00.960
That's just
the way capitalism is.

52:00.961 --> 52:02.162
That's not bad.

52:02.163 --> 52:04.864
But what that means inevitably

52:04.865 --> 52:07.533
is that there's greater
and greater pressure

52:07.534 --> 52:12.105
to push wages and benefits
down to the minimum.

52:12.106 --> 52:14.308
So you're a capitalist.
I'm a capitalist.

52:14.309 --> 52:16.243

52:16.244 --> 52:17.678

the same thing

Well, GE has been creating
more jobs abroad

53:44.266 --> 53:47.334
than it's been creating jobs
in the United States.

of the American worker?

53:49.972 --> 53:52.473
Who is looking out
for the American worker

as GE and other big companies
and Wall Street

53:55.909 --> 53:57.377
and the very wealthy,

53:57.378 --> 53:59.946
who basically have capital
all over the world...

53:59.947 --> 54:03.051

54:09.090 --> 54:12.259

of the American workforce?

54:12.260 --> 54:14.041
The answer is nobody.

54:27.041 --> 54:30.678
So why didn't the nation respond
to the great regression

54:30.679 --> 54:33.680
that started around 1980?

Why didn't we take bold steps

54:36.585 --> 54:40.824

for just about everyone?

54:42.824 --> 54:45.526

three ways

54:45.527 --> 54:48.462
to cope with flattening

without reducing our
relative standard of living.

The first coping mechanism,
starting in the late '70s,

is, women go into paid work.

Some of them did,

56:14.248 --> 56:16.616
but that's not the major
reason women went to work.

56:16.617 --> 56:19.486
They went to work mainly
because they had to prop up

56:19.487 --> 56:21.122
family incomes
that were dropping

56:21.123 --> 56:22.857
because the men in the family,

and I was amazed,

56:51.552 --> 56:53.287
and then I'd go out
into the field,

56:53.288 --> 56:55.055
and I'd go to various cities,
and I'd talk with people,

56:55.056 --> 56:57.524
and people were working,
you know, all hours...

56:57.525 --> 57:01.629
I mean, second jobs,
third jobs, overtime.

57:02.963 --> 57:05.431

But there's a limit
to how hard you can work.

57:18.445 --> 57:21.415
When those were exhausted,
the third coping mechanism

57:21.416 --> 57:23.517
was borrowing, going into debt,

57:23.518 --> 57:27.687
which seemed easy because
housing prices were going up.

(SAW BUZZING)

57:29.257 --> 57:32.526
For 13 years, Americans
have enjoyed a housing boom,

57:32.527 --> 57:34.727
the longest ever.

57:34.728 --> 57:37.765
This a great time to buy
a house in Delray Beach.

57:37.766 --> 57:39.633
You can make,
if you have some cash,

57:39.634 --> 57:41.602
an unbelievable deal.

57:41.603 --> 57:45.939
From the mid-to late '90s
onward,

57:45.940 --> 57:48.975
you have this huge rise
in housing prices.

57:48.976 --> 57:51.412
People said, "Well,
I can take out a loan

57:51.413 --> 57:52.712
against my home."

57:52.713 --> 57:54.314
"I could use my home
as collateral,"

57:54.315 --> 57:55.982
or, "I can refinance my home."

57:55.983 --> 57:57.852
And that kept the
middle class going.

57:57.853 --> 57:59.121
Homes were like piggy banks.

58:01.121 --> 58:04.625
Americans have been using
their home as an ATM,

58:04.626 --> 58:09.296
cashing out more than
$500 billion in home equity

58:09.297 --> 58:14.067
from 2001 to 2005 to cover
expenses like health costs,

58:14.068 --> 58:17.474
student debt, repairs,
and credit cards.

58:19.474 --> 58:24.278
We had a debt bubble prompted
by middle-class America

58:24.279 --> 58:27.848
trying to maintain
its living standard

58:27.849 --> 58:30.654
in the face of stagnant wages.

58:32.654 --> 58:35.122
We're seeing more clients
every day that,

58:35.123 --> 58:37.625
very sadly, they've gotten
into a debt hole

58:37.626 --> 58:40.896
that is very difficult
to dig out of.

58:41.896 --> 58:44.096
But there's a limit
to how far you can do that.

58:44.097 --> 58:46.500
You know, that was a
speculative bubble,

58:46.501 --> 58:49.602
and it burst in 2008.

58:49.603 --> 58:50.803
We know what happened.

58:50.804 --> 58:53.306
And so all of the coping
mechanisms

58:53.307 --> 58:59.680
that the middle class has used
to avoid the inevitable reality

58:59.681 --> 59:02.950
that their wages have gone
nowhere for 30 years,

59:02.951 --> 59:07.391
adjusted for inflation,
are now exhausted.

59:10.391 --> 59:14.026
When the middle class doesn't
share in the economic gains,

59:14.027 --> 59:17.132
you get into this downward
vicious cycle.

59:51.132 --> 59:54.701
The problem is,
for the last three decades,

59:54.702 --> 59:57.203
nothing
has fundamentally changed

59:57.204 --> 59:58.612
in terms of inequality.

01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:03.243
And it wasn't until
the Clinton administration

01:00:03.244 --> 01:00:07.080
that there was an opportunity
to reverse all of this.

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:10.984
And that was what was
so damn frustrating.

01:00:10.985 --> 01:00:13.453

is on the verge of passing

01:00:13.454 --> 01:00:16.323

Things are going well.

01:00:17.492 --> 01:00:20.127
I mean,
we had budget surpluses.

01:00:20.128 --> 01:00:21.995
We might have been able
to take those surpluses

01:00:21.996 --> 01:00:24.397
and invest them in education
and job training,

01:00:24.398 --> 01:00:28.134
change the structure,
ultimately, of the economy.

01:00:28.135 --> 01:00:32.872
But there wasn't the
political will to do that.

01:00:32.873 --> 01:00:34.441
Before I leave,
I also want to say

01:00:34.442 --> 01:00:35.676
a special word of thanks

to my longtime friend
Secretary Reich,

01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:40.379
who's carried on this fight
for the minimum wage.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.850
This was an especially
sweet day for him as well,

01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:44.384
and I thank him for his efforts.

01:00:44.385 --> 01:00:49.154
I should say something just
so it's not misunderstood.

01:00:49.155 --> 01:00:52.392
You know,
Bill Clinton did preside

01:00:52.393 --> 01:00:56.263
over one of the best economies
we've had in this country

01:00:56.264 --> 01:00:57.631
in living memory.

01:00:57.632 --> 01:00:59.665
The wages
of most people went up.

01:00:59.666 --> 01:01:02.303
Poverty actually declined.

01:01:02.304 --> 01:01:04.939
But we didn't do enough.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:09.614
We did really alter
the underlying trend.

01:01:12.614 --> 01:01:15.515
I became a true pain in the ass.

01:01:15.516 --> 01:01:18.953
I mean, looking back on it,
I'm embarrassed.

01:01:18.954 --> 01:01:21.488
In meetings,
I would sound off about,

01:01:21.489 --> 01:01:23.723
you know, inequality,
and, "Are we looking

01:01:23.724 --> 01:01:27.026
at the distributional impacts
of this policy or that policy?"

01:01:27.027 --> 01:01:28.495
I mean, I became predictable.

01:01:28.496 --> 01:01:30.263
People would roll their eyes.

01:01:30.264 --> 01:01:34.067
I'm surprised Bill Clinton
kept me around.

01:01:34.068 --> 01:01:35.602
I did want to bring you
up to date

01:01:35.603 --> 01:01:37.236
on a couple of matters.

01:01:37.237 --> 01:01:40.339
First of all,
the president was reelected.

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.942
(APPLAUSE)

01:01:42.943 --> 01:01:46.312
The second is that I'm going home.

01:01:46.313 --> 01:01:49.082
(AUDIENCE GROANS)

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:52.051
(LAUGHTER)

01:01:52.052 --> 01:01:54.288
I am so glad you did not clap.

01:01:54.289 --> 01:01:56.556
(LAUGHTER)

01:01:56.557 --> 01:01:57.823
In the end, I left.

01:01:57.824 --> 01:01:59.491
Partly, I was frustrated.

01:01:59.492 --> 01:02:02.730
Partly, I just hadn't seen
anything in my family.

01:02:02.731 --> 01:02:04.096
I hadn't seen the boys.

01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:07.945
I said to Bill Clinton
I had to go home.

01:02:17.945 --> 01:02:21.814
I... I do ask myself

01:02:21.815 --> 01:02:25.322
whether I've been
a total failure.

01:02:27.322 --> 01:02:31.124
I've been saying much of the
same thing for 30 years.

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:34.498
And some of the trends
have grown worse.

01:02:36.498 --> 01:02:38.464
Inequality has become worse.

01:02:38.465 --> 01:02:41.271
The danger to the economy and
democracy have become worse.

01:02:44.271 --> 01:02:47.374
But here's what I tell myself

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:49.375
in my quiet moments.

01:02:49.376 --> 01:02:55.381
I say, close to home,
you know, nuts and bolts,

01:02:55.382 --> 01:02:58.518
over the kitchen sink,
dining room table,

01:02:58.519 --> 01:03:02.087
you know, this is what counts
for most people:

01:03:02.088 --> 01:03:08.062
good jobs, good wages,
a good opportunity

01:03:08.063 --> 01:03:11.665
and set of opportunities
for their kids.

01:03:11.666 --> 01:03:13.036
This is where people live.

01:03:16.036 --> 01:03:18.270
Detective Conan O'Brien

01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:22.246
and Detective Former Secretary
of Labor Robert Reich.

01:03:25.246 --> 01:03:27.080
I am a cockeyed optimist.

01:03:27.081 --> 01:03:29.381
I ask you, do I look
like big government?

01:03:29.382 --> 01:03:30.649
(LAUGHTER)

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:33.653
I wouldn't have spent
so much of my adult life

01:03:33.654 --> 01:03:36.122
banging my head against the
wall if I didn't think

01:03:36.123 --> 01:03:38.892
that ultimately
it would pay off

01:03:38.893 --> 01:03:41.227
in terms of social change.

01:03:41.228 --> 01:03:44.997
No!

01:03:44.998 --> 01:03:47.404
That's why I teach.

01:03:49.404 --> 01:03:52.339
Now, people who are worried
about widening inequality

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:56.276
are also worried
about something else.

01:03:56.277 --> 01:03:58.044
It's not upward mobility.

01:03:58.045 --> 01:04:00.046
It's not even trust.

01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:06.556
They are worried about the
undermining of democracy...

01:04:08.556 --> 01:04:12.158
when so many resources,
so much money, so much wealth,

01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:14.794
so much income
accumulates at the very top,

01:04:14.795 --> 01:04:19.598
that with money
comes the capacity

01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:22.938
to control politics.

01:04:23.938 --> 01:04:26.941
(SLICK SPY MUSIC)

01:04:34.581 --> 01:04:36.884
There's nothing sinister
the way it starts.

01:04:36.885 --> 01:04:38.183
Usually they bring in somebody

01:04:38.184 --> 01:04:39.919
you haven't seen
for a few years.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.888
You know,
they're paying them 10 grand.

01:04:41.889 --> 01:04:43.857
Might be the best man
in your wedding

01:04:43.858 --> 01:04:45.392
or a guy
you played football with.

01:04:45.393 --> 01:04:47.259
You say, "Eddie, hell,
I haven't seen you..."

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.796
And then they say, "Now,
I'd like to turn it over

01:04:49.797 --> 01:04:51.964
to old Freckles here..."

01:04:51.965 --> 01:04:54.701
And then they give you
the whole load.

01:04:54.702 --> 01:04:57.504
But money...
I mean, do the lobbyists come in

01:04:57.505 --> 01:05:02.241
and obviously
the unspoken reality is,

01:05:02.242 --> 01:05:04.009
"We can help you win
your next election

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:05.312
if you cooperate with us"?

01:05:05.313 --> 01:05:07.448
There's a guy in every office

01:05:07.449 --> 01:05:09.281
to say, "So-and-so
wants to see you.

"He's from the American
Shoe Leather Company.

01:05:12.119 --> 01:05:14.687
"They have maxed out,"
meaning they gave you

01:05:14.688 --> 01:05:18.125
the maximum in your primary
when you first started.

01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:20.326
"They gave you the maximum
in every general.

01:05:20.327 --> 01:05:21.962
"You've run three times now,

01:05:21.963 --> 01:05:24.730
and they were there for you
at every point."

01:05:24.731 --> 01:05:25.966

01:05:25.967 --> 01:05:27.670
Access.

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:31.904
This is actually
where there is blame,

01:05:31.905 --> 01:05:35.008
and I think the blame
is justifiable.

01:05:35.009 --> 01:05:36.475
It's not that people are rich.

01:05:36.476 --> 01:05:40.279
It's that they abuse
their wealth

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:46.720
by lobbying for bailouts
and subsidies and taxes

01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:49.756
that are going to entrench
their wealth.

01:05:49.757 --> 01:05:53.593
That's the reason why the rules
have changed so dramatically.

01:05:53.594 --> 01:05:54.895
Look at history.

01:05:54.896 --> 01:05:57.430
Inequality and top tax rates

01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:59.899
have had
an inverse relationship.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.669
When inequality was lowest,
top tax rates were higher.

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:07.439
When inequality was highest,
tax rates on the wealthy

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.753
went down.

01:06:19.753 --> 01:06:23.089
Under Dwight D. Eisenhower...
you know, he was a Republican;

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:25.058
nobody dared call him
a socialist...

01:06:25.059 --> 01:06:29.395
the top marginal tax rate
was 91%.

01:06:29.396 --> 01:06:30.997
I mean, even when you consider

01:06:30.998 --> 01:06:33.100
all deductions
and all tax credits,

01:06:33.101 --> 01:06:35.602
they were still paying
way over 50%.

01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:38.705
I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy,
do solemnly swear...

01:06:38.706 --> 01:06:40.306
I will faithfully execute...

01:06:40.307 --> 01:06:43.709
The office of president
of the United States...

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:44.877
So help me, God.

01:06:44.878 --> 01:06:46.178
So help me, God.

01:06:46.179 --> 01:06:50.484
Taxes on the top
were never below 70%

01:06:50.485 --> 01:06:54.126
until Reagan dropped
those taxes on the top.

01:06:59.126 --> 01:07:01.694
Read my lips.

01:07:01.695 --> 01:07:05.098
No new taxes.

01:07:05.099 --> 01:07:07.968
I, William Jefferson Clinton...

01:07:07.969 --> 01:07:09.134
I, George Walker Bush...

01:07:09.135 --> 01:07:10.335
Do solemnly swear...

01:07:10.336 --> 01:07:11.772
Do solemnly swear...

01:07:11.773 --> 01:07:15.140
I, Barack Hussein Obama,
do solemnly swear...

01:07:15.141 --> 01:07:16.977
In fact, most of the very
rich in this country

01:07:16.978 --> 01:07:18.412
don't even pay close to that

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:20.312
because most of their income
is in the form

01:07:20.313 --> 01:07:23.482
of capital gains,
which is now taxed at 15%.

01:07:23.483 --> 01:07:27.654
My total taxes paid... payroll
taxes plus income tax,

01:07:27.655 --> 01:07:31.158
mine came to 17.7%.

01:07:31.159 --> 01:07:33.725
The average for the office
was 32.9%.

01:07:33.726 --> 01:07:35.495
There wasn't anybody
in the office,

01:07:35.496 --> 01:07:37.730
from the receptionist on,
that paid as low a tax rate.

01:07:37.731 --> 01:07:41.334
The taxation system
has tilted toward the rich

01:07:41.335 --> 01:07:43.837
and away from the middle
class in the last ten years.

01:07:43.838 --> 01:07:46.573
It is dramatic, and I don't
think it's appreciated.

01:07:46.574 --> 01:07:48.475
What's the effective rate
I've been paying?

01:07:48.476 --> 01:07:51.076
Well, it's probably closer to
the 15% rate than anything.

01:07:51.077 --> 01:07:54.781
Mr. Romney's income taxes
were finally posted,

01:07:54.782 --> 01:07:57.383
and he paid 13.9%.

01:07:57.384 --> 01:08:00.854
Nancy and I paid 33% or more.

01:08:00.855 --> 01:08:04.957
It was in the 30s,
and I find that atrocious.

01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:10.796
I paid 11% last year
on an eight-figure income.

01:08:10.797 --> 01:08:13.567
Wowzers.
So less than Mitt Romney.

01:08:13.568 --> 01:08:17.170
When you give rich
businesspeople tax breaks

01:08:17.171 --> 01:08:18.705
all in the name of job creation,

01:08:18.706 --> 01:08:21.974
all that really happens is
that the fat cats get fatter.

01:08:21.975 --> 01:08:23.876
And, of course,
that's what's happened

01:08:23.877 --> 01:08:24.978
over the last 30 years.

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:26.712
That's the signature feature

01:08:26.712 --> 01:08:29.484
of the economy
over the last 30 years.

01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:36.822
Look, nobody wants
to pay taxes.

01:08:36.823 --> 01:08:40.093
But taxes are the price we pay
to finance the kinds of things

01:08:40.094 --> 01:08:44.634
that we can't do individually,
that we need to do together.

01:08:46.634 --> 01:08:48.935
There's kind of a negative
trickle-down effect,

01:08:48.935 --> 01:08:50.670
and it starts in Washington.

01:08:50.671 --> 01:08:53.706
I mean, if the wealthy are
not paying their fair share

01:08:53.707 --> 01:08:56.309
and if the middle class
are basically stagnant

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:57.943
and are not paying much
in taxes

01:08:57.944 --> 01:09:00.212
because they're not making
much money,

01:09:00.212 --> 01:09:02.247
then you're gonna have
a budget crisis

01:09:02.247 --> 01:09:03.353
somewhere along the line.

01:09:06.353 --> 01:09:09.024
That means less revenue
sharing with the states.

01:09:11.024 --> 01:09:13.459
That means the states
have to pull in their belts.

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.662
They cannot support
public higher education.

01:09:17.663 --> 01:09:22.702
As state funding to institutions
of higher education went down,

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:25.475
tuitions went up to compensate.

01:09:27.475 --> 01:09:29.443
I mean, at Berkeley,
where I teach,

01:09:29.444 --> 01:09:33.080
in the 1960s, tuition was free.

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:36.483
In the 1970s,
it was $700 a year

01:09:36.484 --> 01:09:39.286
in today's dollars.

01:09:39.287 --> 01:09:43.055
But now it costs $15,000

01:09:43.055 --> 01:09:44.228
for in-state residents.

01:09:47.228 --> 01:09:48.861
Next week, members of Congress

01:09:48.862 --> 01:09:50.863
are gonna have a chance
to vote on what we call

01:09:50.863 --> 01:09:52.999
the Buffett Rule,
and it's simple.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.970
If you make more money...
more than $1 million a year,

01:09:57.971 --> 01:10:00.473
not if you have $1 million

01:10:00.474 --> 01:10:03.644
but if you make more
than $1 million a year,

01:10:03.645 --> 01:10:05.946
you should pay
at least the same percentage

01:10:05.947 --> 01:10:09.482
of your income in taxes
as middle-class families do.

01:10:09.483 --> 01:10:10.916
He is killing the economy,

01:10:10.917 --> 01:10:12.718
and this is class warfare.

01:10:12.719 --> 01:10:15.188
I think Barack Obama
is a socialist.

01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:16.488
It'll only be a minimum tax

01:10:16.489 --> 01:10:18.558
on people who make
lots of money.

01:10:18.559 --> 01:10:21.394
More class warfare
from an affable billionaire.

01:10:21.395 --> 01:10:23.996
Is he completely a socialist?

01:10:23.997 --> 01:10:26.072
(LAUGHTER)

01:10:31.072 --> 01:10:33.805
Is Warren Buffett a socialist?

01:10:33.806 --> 01:10:35.175
(LAUGHTER)

01:10:35.176 --> 01:10:38.978
You really have no (BLEEP) clue
what socialism is, do you?

CEOs and Wall Street
have been doing terribly...

01:10:41.215 --> 01:10:42.514
you know, enormously well.

01:10:42.515 --> 01:10:44.651
Why should they get
continued tax cuts

01:10:44.652 --> 01:10:48.153
when, in fact, we have a huge
deficit way down the line?

01:10:48.154 --> 01:10:49.589
Robert Reich.
You know Robert Reich?

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:51.023
I do indeed.
He's a Communist.

01:10:51.024 --> 01:10:53.326
You know that, right?
Communist/socialist.

01:10:53.327 --> 01:10:55.261
Okay.
Confused. He's a confused.

01:10:55.262 --> 01:10:56.929
The guy secretly adores
Karl Marx

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.264
and is up there in Cambridge...

01:10:59.265 --> 01:11:00.599
Can I just be clear about this?

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.569
I am not, nor have I ever been,

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:06.505
a member of the Communist
Party or a Communist.

01:11:06.506 --> 01:11:08.175
A lot of people are
watching Fox, and I like Fox.

01:11:08.176 --> 01:11:10.643
I like appearing with you,
and I like you personally.

01:11:10.644 --> 01:11:12.511
I used to be on O'Reilly's show.

01:11:12.512 --> 01:11:13.880
In fact, I even substituted

01:11:13.881 --> 01:11:15.848
for Bill O'Reilly
a couple of times.

01:11:15.849 --> 01:11:17.283
He asked me.

01:11:17.284 --> 01:11:18.984
I was on Fox quite a lot.

01:11:18.985 --> 01:11:21.020
Joining us now
is former labor secretary,

01:11:21.021 --> 01:11:22.221
our good friend Robert Reich.

01:11:22.222 --> 01:11:23.724
Secretary, how are you,
my friend?

01:11:23.725 --> 01:11:24.823
Good see you.

01:11:24.824 --> 01:11:26.358
But no longer.

01:11:26.359 --> 01:11:28.728
They don't ask.

01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:30.662
The football field
of American politics

01:11:30.663 --> 01:11:33.633
has kept on shifting
to the right.

01:11:33.634 --> 01:11:36.702
I just... you know,
basically I just stand here.

01:11:36.703 --> 01:11:38.772
I've watched it move.

01:11:38.773 --> 01:11:40.907
I used to be
something of a centrist.

01:11:40.908 --> 01:11:44.778
In fact, my first job was
in the Ford administration.

01:11:44.779 --> 01:11:45.879
Hello.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.746
That's a Republican
administration.

01:11:47.747 --> 01:11:51.283
You know, were considered
conservative in the 1990s.

01:11:51.284 --> 01:11:52.785
Yeah.

01:11:52.786 --> 01:11:56.555
You almost became the majority
leader of the Senate.

01:11:56.556 --> 01:11:58.724
I could have been king.

01:11:58.725 --> 01:12:01.461
Our staffs
were not terribly happy

01:12:01.462 --> 01:12:02.995
that we were getting together.

01:12:02.996 --> 01:12:07.867
My staff said, "Don't have lunch
with this right-winger."

01:12:07.868 --> 01:12:09.602

From Wyoming.

01:12:09.603 --> 01:12:11.871
"There's nothing in it."

01:12:11.872 --> 01:12:13.973
We were approached
about doing a show.

01:12:13.974 --> 01:12:15.006
Mm-hmm.

01:12:15.007 --> 01:12:17.345
(APPLAUSE)

01:12:19.345 --> 01:12:21.179
Hello, Robert.
Good to see you again.

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:22.348
Good evening.
Yeah, here.

01:12:22.349 --> 01:12:25.352
Oh, thank you so much.

01:12:25.353 --> 01:12:27.554
You're now considered
a moderate,

01:12:27.555 --> 01:12:29.589
if not lefty.

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:31.825
Commie.
What happened?

01:12:31.826 --> 01:12:34.359
They came in,
and they brought with them

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:37.029
an antigovernment hatred.

01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:40.233
And you don't have
adversaries anymore.

01:12:40.234 --> 01:12:42.167
You have enemies.

01:12:42.168 --> 01:12:44.804
There does seem to be
a strong correlation

01:12:44.805 --> 01:12:48.474
between political
polarization on the one hand

01:12:48.475 --> 01:12:52.278
and widening
economic inequality.

01:12:52.279 --> 01:12:54.412
Researchers measured
the distance

01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:56.049
between the median
voting patterns

01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:57.950
of one party
and the other party,

01:12:57.951 --> 01:13:02.621
and what they found is that
in times of high inequality,

01:13:02.622 --> 01:13:06.826
you have the highest degree
of polarization.

01:13:06.827 --> 01:13:09.667
It almost tracks exactly.

01:13:13.667 --> 01:13:17.871
You see how totally
integrated and connected

01:13:17.872 --> 01:13:21.273
the issue of inequality is
to our democracy.

01:13:21.274 --> 01:13:25.144
And you see how the ultimate
guardians of our democracy...

01:13:25.145 --> 01:13:26.813
if Congress doesn't do it

01:13:26.814 --> 01:13:28.781
and if the executive
doesn't do it,

01:13:28.782 --> 01:13:31.923
the ultimate guardians
are up here.

01:13:36.923 --> 01:13:41.027
In 2010, the Supreme Court
in Citizens United

01:13:41.028 --> 01:13:44.363
decided that corporations
are people.

01:13:44.364 --> 01:13:47.166
And as Citizens United was
interpreted by lower courts,

01:13:47.167 --> 01:13:49.368
it basically said
that corporations,

01:13:49.369 --> 01:13:52.572
wealthy individuals, anybody
who has a lot of money,

01:13:52.573 --> 01:13:54.840
can flood the political system,

01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:58.044
can basically inundate
our democracy

01:13:58.045 --> 01:13:59.582
with their money.

01:14:02.582 --> 01:14:04.084
Mr. Wertheimer?

01:14:04.085 --> 01:14:06.620
Robert, how are you?
How are you?

01:14:06.621 --> 01:14:11.489
The idea that a corporation
could spend $1 billion

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:14.660
in an election
to elect a president

01:14:14.661 --> 01:14:17.229
and it would not have
the capacity

01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:20.233
to have a corrupting influence
over government decisions...

01:14:20.234 --> 01:14:21.533
That's absurd.
I mean...

01:14:21.534 --> 01:14:24.373
Is a concept
from another planet.

01:14:27.373 --> 01:14:29.541
The money isn't new.

01:14:29.542 --> 01:14:32.379
The quantity of the money
is new.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.013
In the last
presidential election,

01:14:34.014 --> 01:14:36.950
we saw for the first time
in this country

01:14:36.951 --> 01:14:37.950
billionaires...

01:14:37.951 --> 01:14:40.419
I mean,
a handful of billionaires...

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:42.855
contributing huge sums of money

01:14:42.856 --> 01:14:44.189
to individual candidates,

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:46.229
basically keeping
those candidates going.

01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:51.430
I mean, is this America?

01:14:51.431 --> 01:14:52.765
Not in my mind.

01:14:52.766 --> 01:14:54.570
I think
it's absolutely stupefying.

01:14:57.570 --> 01:14:59.805
I think, if you keep going,

01:14:59.806 --> 01:15:01.407
in the next presidential
election,

01:15:01.408 --> 01:15:05.344
it will be, "Have you got
$300 million in your pocket?

01:15:05.345 --> 01:15:07.681
'Cause you can buy a president."

01:15:08.681 --> 01:15:11.718
There are liberal billionaires.

01:15:11.719 --> 01:15:14.187
There are conservative
billionaires.

01:15:14.188 --> 01:15:21.126
So if you see someone buying
a result that you like,

01:15:21.127 --> 01:15:24.496
someone else can buy a result
that you're gonna hate

01:15:24.497 --> 01:15:27.099
if they can give
a huge amount of money.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.141
You cannot have government
on the auction block.

01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:37.977
When we see the contrast
between the values we share

01:15:37.978 --> 01:15:40.278
and the realities we live in,

01:15:40.279 --> 01:15:44.716

foundation for social change.

01:15:50.858 --> 01:15:53.827
was born in the wake
of the Wall Street bailout.

01:15:53.828 --> 01:15:55.795

01:15:55.796 --> 01:15:57.429

how much money people have.

having their voices heard.

01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:48.335
I was always getting beat up.

01:19:55.335 --> 01:19:58.603
When I was a kid,
the bigger boys

01:19:58.604 --> 01:20:00.273
would pick on me.

01:20:00.274 --> 01:20:02.474
You know,
that was what you did.

01:20:02.475 --> 01:20:05.277
That's what is done.

01:20:05.278 --> 01:20:08.447
So I got an idea
that I would make alliances

01:20:08.448 --> 01:20:09.747
with older boys,

01:20:09.748 --> 01:20:11.350
you know, like, just one or two

01:20:11.351 --> 01:20:13.189
who would be my protectors.

01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:18.991
The summer when I was about ten,

01:20:18.992 --> 01:20:21.193
one of the older boys
who I depended on

01:20:21.194 --> 01:20:25.665
to kind of be a protector, his
name was Michael Schwerner.

01:20:25.666 --> 01:20:30.435
In the summer of '64,
I learned that Mickey

01:20:30.436 --> 01:20:37.376
had been in Mississippi
registering voters.

01:20:37.377 --> 01:20:41.913
And he and two other people
who had been with him

01:20:41.914 --> 01:20:45.718
registering voters were...

01:20:45.719 --> 01:20:48.056
were tortured and murdered.

01:20:51.056 --> 01:20:54.193
And when I heard
that my protector

01:20:54.194 --> 01:21:01.002
had been murdered
by the real bullies...

01:21:03.002 --> 01:21:06.138
I think it changed my life.

01:21:06.139 --> 01:21:10.108
I had to protect people
from the bullies,

01:21:10.109 --> 01:21:12.344
the people who would
beat them up economically

01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:15.480
or the people who would subject
them and their families

01:21:15.481 --> 01:21:18.082
to real harm.

01:21:18.083 --> 01:21:19.751
Because if you don't
have a voice,

01:21:19.752 --> 01:21:21.120
if you don't have power,

01:21:21.121 --> 01:21:23.956
if you are vulnerable
economically in society,

01:21:23.957 --> 01:21:27.033
you don't have anybody
to protect you.

01:21:34.033 --> 01:21:37.536
There's no single magic bullet

01:21:37.537 --> 01:21:38.871
to solving this problem.

01:21:38.872 --> 01:21:40.540
I mean, I've written
a lot of books.

01:21:40.541 --> 01:21:43.442
I've come up with a lot
of policy ideas.

01:21:43.443 --> 01:21:47.248
I'm not alone.
Policy ideas are plentiful.

01:21:49.248 --> 01:21:52.684
Remember, we make the rules
of the economy.

01:21:52.685 --> 01:21:56.658
And we have the power
to change those rules.

01:21:57.658 --> 01:22:00.960
You've got to mobilize.
You've got to organize.

01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:04.196
You've got to energize
other people.

01:22:04.197 --> 01:22:08.033
Politics is not out there.

(STUDENTS GROAN)

01:22:28.255 --> 01:22:29.788
Remember the first part
of the course,

01:22:29.789 --> 01:22:32.825
we looked at the dynamics
of wealth and poverty,

01:22:32.826 --> 01:22:34.260
and many of you...
many of you

01:22:34.261 --> 01:22:38.163
were a little bit down
after that?

01:22:38.164 --> 01:22:40.700
And some of you worried
that that dynamic

01:22:40.701 --> 01:22:42.667
was inevitable.

01:22:42.668 --> 01:22:44.769
Is this going to be
just a partisan fight?

01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:48.806
Are we just going to have
class warfare in this country?

01:22:48.807 --> 01:22:50.175
No.

01:22:50.176 --> 01:22:53.246
The rich actually do better

01:22:53.247 --> 01:22:56.014
with an economy
that is growing faster,

01:22:56.015 --> 01:22:58.084
when everybody else
is doing better.

01:22:58.085 --> 01:23:01.754
This is not a zero-sum game.

01:23:01.755 --> 01:23:08.094
History is on the side
of positive social change:

01:23:08.095 --> 01:23:11.162
unemployment insurance,
social security,

01:23:11.163 --> 01:23:14.233
civil rights,
and voting rights,

01:23:14.234 --> 01:23:16.001
environmental protection,

01:23:16.002 --> 01:23:17.536
the Environmental
Protection Act,

01:23:17.537 --> 01:23:20.906
signed into law
by Richard Nixon,

01:23:20.907 --> 01:23:22.174

about the possibility
of social progress,

01:23:45.398 --> 01:23:47.368
To you.

01:23:48.368 --> 01:23:50.669
You don't necessarily
need to be elected

01:23:50.670 --> 01:23:53.270
president of the United States
or be a secretary of labor

01:23:53.271 --> 01:23:55.344
to have a huge impact.

01:23:57.344 --> 01:24:00.246

are going to change

may your days be filled
