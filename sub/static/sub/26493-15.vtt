WEBVTT

00:00.620 --> 00:02.360
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:02.370 --> 00:03.166
I'VE BEEN ROBBED.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.114
DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

00:04.120 --> 00:05.497
WITH MY SECURITY
CAMERAS BEING OFF?

00:05.500 --> 00:08.083
SO ARE WE GONNA IGNORE
THE OBVIOUS HERE ON PURPOSE?

00:08.090 --> 00:09.797
LET'S SEE, SPENCER
HAS BEEN FIGHTING

00:09.800 --> 00:11.040
WITH THE GANGS
IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:11.050 --> 00:12.085
YOU GOT ME CONFUSED, BRO.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.717
I'll PUT YOUR ASS DOWN LIKE
A DOG AND WON'T THINK TWICE.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.757
OLIVIA: I KNOW HOW I'D
FEEL IF THIS HAPPENED TO ME,

00:15.760 --> 00:18.559
SO I FIGURED YOU MIGHT
NEED A LITTLE COMPANY.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.928
IF THERE'S ONE THING I LEARNED
ABOUT YOU, PREACH, IT'S LOYALTY.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.932
THE STRONGER THE LOYALTY,
THE DEEPER THE BOND.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.430
TYRONE HAD
YOUR FAMILY KILLED.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.852
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
YOU'RE COOL WITH THAT?

00:27.860 --> 00:30.181
WE DON'T NEED YOUR GIFTS
AROUND HERE, A'TGHT? WE GOOD.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.351
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
MIGHT THINK DIFFERENTLY.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.771
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU'RE BACK,

00:32.780 --> 00:34.657
AND IT'S PROBABLY BEST
WE KEEP IT THAT WAY.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.311
I WASN'T COMPLETELY HONEST
AS TO WHY YOUR FATHER LEFT.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.368
I'M NOT PROUD OF THE WAY
I GHOSTED ON MY FAMILY,

00:39.370 --> 00:41.611
BUT GIVEN THE
CIRCUMSTANCES AT THAT TIME,

00:41.620 --> 00:43.577
IT FELT LIKE
THE ONLY THING TO DO.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.780
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

00:47.790 --> 00:49.872
IT DON'T MATTER.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.416
OF COURSE IT MATTERS.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.127
YOU WORKED HARD FOR THAT.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.462
HE WASN'T THERE.

00:55.470 --> 00:57.336
WHY DID HE LEAVE?

00:57.340 --> 00:59.422
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

01:02.980 --> 01:04.971
NOTHING HAPPENED.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.473
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
GROW APART.

01:10.110 --> 01:11.600
BUT NO MATTER WHAT,

01:11.610 --> 01:13.817
WE BOTH LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH.

01:13.820 --> 01:15.640
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

01:15.650 --> 01:17.311
YEAH.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.233
COME HERE.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.332
YAY!

02:02.910 --> 02:04.901
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

02:04.910 --> 02:08.038
SO I'VE GIVEN YOU
YOUR SPACE THIS WEEK,

02:08.039 --> 02:09.417
BUT IT'S TIME WE TALK.

02:09.419 --> 02:12.788
WHY? EVERYTHING OUT YOUR
MOUTH GONNA BE LIES ANYWAY.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.246
YOU ONLY GET ONE
OF THOSE.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.911
LOOK, SPENCER,

02:15.920 --> 02:18.082
WHAT HAPPENED
WAS A MISTAKE.

02:18.090 --> 02:20.752
IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE
HAPPENED AND...

02:20.760 --> 02:22.922
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

02:22.930 --> 02:25.092
I'M SO SORRY, BABY.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.341
WE WERE BOTH IN A REALLY
DARK PLACE AT THE TIME.

02:27.350 --> 02:30.183
I WAS IN A DARK PLACE WHEN DAD
TOOK OFF AND YOU LEFT ME THERE.

02:30.190 --> 02:33.433
ALL THIS TIME, YOU KNEW THE REASON
HE LEFT AND YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.397
-HOLD UP.
-AND YOU MOVED ME INTO YOUR HOME,

02:35.400 --> 02:37.107
PRETENDED TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT MY MISSING FATHER

02:37.110 --> 02:39.021
WHEN YOU KNEW
THE TRUTH, TOO.

02:39.030 --> 02:40.486
DILLON:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:40.490 --> 02:42.618
WHY'S COACH BAKER HERE?

02:42.620 --> 02:47.285
HE JUST...STOPPED BY TO DROP
OFF SOMETHING FOR SPENCER.

02:47.290 --> 02:49.327
YOU STILL DOING IT.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.878
LOOK, YOU DESERVE
TO KNOW THE TRUTH, MAN.

03:01.470 --> 03:03.632
DAD'S BACK.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.802
WHAT?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.146
MAN: BOY, YOU CAN'T STOP

03:12.150 --> 03:13.606
YOU KNOW YOU WANT
US TO SHINE

03:14.980 --> 03:16.641
GET IT ALL ON THE LINE

03:16.650 --> 03:17.936
ANNOUNCER: AND ANOTHER
THRILLING VICTORY

03:17.940 --> 03:19.487
FOR THE BEVERLY HIGH
EAGLES.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.527
JORDAN: ALL RIGHT, WHOSE HOUSE?
PLAYERS: OUR HOUSE!

03:21.530 --> 03:22.736
-WHOSE HOUSE?
-OUR HOUSE!

03:22.740 --> 03:25.368
-WHO'S NEXT?
-SOUTH CRENSHAW!

03:25.370 --> 03:27.236
YOUR OLD TEAM,
BRO.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.743
THE BEST GIFT I COULD GIVE
Y'ALL AFTER A GAME LIKE THAT

03:29.750 --> 03:31.821
IS A SHORT SPEECH.

03:34.670 --> 03:37.799
YOU'VE GIVEN ME
EVERYTHING ALL YEAR,

03:37.800 --> 03:40.212
AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.837
I'M JUST ASKING
FOR ONE MORE GAME.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.172
IF WE BEAT SOUTH CRENSHAW,

03:45.180 --> 03:47.968
WE WILL BE STATE CHAMPIONS.
Y'ALL HEARD?

03:47.970 --> 03:49.677
-YES, SIR!
- 1 SAID, "Y'ALL HEARD?"

03:49.680 --> 03:51.341
-YES, SIR!
-LET'S GET IT.

03:56.360 --> 04:00.069
LOOK, WE WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE IT THIS FAR WITHOUT YOU.

04:00.070 --> 04:02.698
THE TEAM COULDN'T ASK
FOR A BETTER CAPTAIN,

04:02.700 --> 04:04.316
AND, UM,

04:04.320 --> 04:08.325
I COULDN'T ASK FOR
A BETTER SON, SO...

04:08.330 --> 04:10.742
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.208
SO MUCH FOR YOUR
SHORT SPEECH, DAD.

04:23.340 --> 04:26.219
YOU EVER GONNA TELL
YOUR FAMILY THE TRUTH?

04:32.640 --> 04:36.895
LOOK...I'M SORRY
I HURT YOU.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.723
I AM, AND IF I COULD
CHANGE EVERYTHING,

04:40.730 --> 04:45.657
I WOULD, BUT HASN'T ALL THIS
HURT ENOUGH PEOPLE ALREADY?

04:45.660 --> 04:49.449
IT'S BEEN YEARS, SPENCER.

04:49.450 --> 04:52.659
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD TELLING
MY FAMILY ACCOMPLISH NOW

04:52.660 --> 04:55.163
EXCEPT...
BRINGING THEM MORE PAIN?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.377
IT MIGHT BE EASY FOR YOU
TO LIVE IN THAT HOUSE

04:57.380 --> 05:01.339
AND LIE TO YOUR FAMILY,
BUT I CAN'T, A'IGHT?

05:01.340 --> 05:05.379
SO YOU GOT TO TELL THEM BY
THE END OF THE WEEKEND, OR I WILL.

05:24.530 --> 05:26.316
HEY.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.197
CONGRATS ON
MAKING IT TO STATE.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.407
80 YARDS AND A
TOUCHDOWN. NOT BAD.

05:30.410 --> 05:32.572
-84 YARDS.
-OH. EXCUSE ME.

05:32.580 --> 05:35.709
HA HA! IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER A
HUNDRED, BUT BUTLER MISSED THAT BLOCK.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.075
OH, YEAH.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.497
I HEARD LEILA'S CRASHING
AT YOUR PLACE.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.128
GUESS HOTEL BAKER
ISN'T THAT FULL.

05:43.130 --> 05:45.007
OK, GET SOMEONE
TO ROB YOUR HOUSE

05:45.010 --> 05:46.796
AND I'll SEE WHAT I
CAN DO, OK?

05:46.800 --> 05:49.087
-HOW'S SHE DOING?
-SHE'S OK.

05:49.090 --> 05:52.424
I CAN'T BLAME HER FOR NOT WANTING
TO BE ALONE IN THAT HOUSE, THOUGH.

05:52.430 --> 05:53.716
YEAH.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.262
THINGS ANY BETTER
AT YOURS?

05:57.270 --> 05:58.760
THEY'RE FINE.

05:58.770 --> 06:01.762
GUESS NEVER A DULL MOMENT
AT THE ADAMS' MOTEL.

06:01.770 --> 06:03.431
HAROLD:
THERE'S MY BOY.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.522
ALMOST A HUNDRED
YARDS RECEIVING.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.601
STUPID BUTLER.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.271
YEAH, I KNOW. HEH!

06:09.280 --> 06:11.271
HEY, I GOTTA GO.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.780
MAYBE I SHOULD DRIVE.

06:16.540 --> 06:19.453
LEILA: HEY, THEY WERE REALLY
ROUGH ON YOU OUT THERE.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.280
-NOTHING I COOUIÃ©_DN'T HANDLE.

06:21.290 --> 06:23.793
I WAS GONNA OFFER YOU
A MASSAGE, BUT YOU'RE OK.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.949
-OH. OH, NO, NO, NO.
-NO, YOU LOOK GREAT.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.792
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE'S SO MUCH PAIN.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.336
-OH, IT DOES HURT?
-YEAH.

06:28.340 --> 06:29.546
COREY: SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

06:29.550 --> 06:31.757
JUST WANT TO SAY
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.310
MAN, YOU PLAYED
ONE HELL OF A GAME.

06:35.310 --> 06:36.459
THANKS.

06:39.810 --> 06:42.518
THIS IS
MY GIRL, LEILA.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.818
BABY, THIS IS, UM...

06:44.820 --> 06:46.356
COREY JAMES.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.442
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.736
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.027
I KNOW IT'S LAST-MINUTE,
BUT I WAS THINKING

06:52.030 --> 06:54.112
MAYBE I COULD
TAKE YOU TO DINNER.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.329
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU MAKE
IT TO STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.491
YOU SHOULD COME, TOO.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.706
WE GOT PLANS.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.338
I MEANT WHAT I SAID.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.832
I WANT A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU AND DILLON.

07:06.840 --> 07:10.470
YEAH. LET'S GO, BABE.

07:10.470 --> 07:12.381
NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.347
YOU, TOO.

07:19.270 --> 07:22.058
REGGIE: SO TAMIA COMES IN
AND SAYS IT'S RAINING INSIDE,

07:22.060 --> 07:24.108
AND TURNS OUT THAT THE
PIPES HAD BURST IN HER ROOM

07:24.110 --> 07:26.010
AND IT REALLY--
IT REALLY WAS RAINING.

07:26.020 --> 07:28.148
HA HA HA. THAT'S NOT
FUNNY. I COULD'VE DROWNED.

07:28.150 --> 07:30.061
OH, BUT LUCKY FOR US,
YOU DIDN'T.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.486
I'M GONNA GET THE CHECK.

07:32.490 --> 07:34.276
UH-UH, YOU BETTER NOT
BE REACHING FOR THAT WALLET.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.443
PAY ME BACK WHEN YOU'RE
A BIG-TIME NFL STAR.

07:37.450 --> 07:39.828
ALL RIGHT,
YOU GOT IT.

07:39.830 --> 07:42.117
HEY, IT'S GOOD TO SEE Y'ALL
TWO GETTING ALONG AGAIN.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.782
YEAH, MAN,
EVERYTHING IS GREAT.

07:44.790 --> 07:47.122
NOT EVERYTHING.

07:47.130 --> 07:50.088
YO, WHY YOU GOT
TO BRING THAT UP?

07:50.090 --> 07:51.831
YOU KNOW WHAT PREACH
IS GONNA DO TO TYRONE.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.751
SHAWN IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF TYRONE.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.501
HE DESERVE WHATEVER
GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM.

07:55.510 --> 07:57.092
I KNOW YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.387
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT
A KILLER, COOP,

07:59.390 --> 08:01.722
AND OFFERING UP TYRONE IS THE
SAME AS PULLING THE TRIGGER YOURSELF.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.687
PATIENCE: WHEN ALL THIS
STARTED, I TOLD YOU

08:03.690 --> 08:05.397
I'D MAKE SURE
COOP STAYED COOP.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.765
AND YOU AIN'T GOT
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.522
-WELL, I AM WORRIED.
-HOW YOU GONNA FEEL

08:08.530 --> 08:11.397
WHEN YOU GOT TYRONE'S BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS, HUH?

08:11.400 --> 08:12.481
KIDS, READY TO GO?

08:12.490 --> 08:13.901
-YES, SIR.
-YEAH.

08:26.330 --> 08:29.129
-WHAT UP, D?
-WHERE YOU BEEN?

08:29.130 --> 08:31.007
-WITH COOP.
-FOR REAL, FOR REAL,

08:31.010 --> 08:34.048
OR YOU DON'T WANT ME TO KNOW
THAT YOU WERE WITH DAD?

08:34.049 --> 08:36.006
LOOK, MAN, I KNOW YOU
WANT TO MEET HIM,

08:36.010 --> 08:38.001
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.216
-WHY NOT?
-'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU

08:39.220 --> 08:40.346
GETTING HURT WHEN
HE LEAVES AGAIN.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.057
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE'S GOING TO?

08:42.059 --> 08:43.687
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE
HASN'T CHANGED?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.556
PEOPLE LIKE HIM
DON'T CHANGE.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.972
WHY'D YOU EVEN
TELL ME HE WAS HERE

08:47.980 --> 08:49.687
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO SEE HIM?

08:49.690 --> 08:52.899
'CAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO LIE TO YOU.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.278
BUT YOU GOT TO
TRUST ME, A'IGHT?

08:55.280 --> 08:56.770
WE'RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HIM.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.612
WHY DO YOU GET
TO DECIDE WHAT I DO?

08:58.620 --> 09:00.361
YOU DON'T EVEN
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

09:00.370 --> 09:02.077
YOU'RE OFF WITH YOUR
OTHER FAMILY IN BEVERLY HILLS

09:02.080 --> 09:03.400
WHILE I'M STUCK
HERE ALONE.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.161
D.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.335
CHRIS: HEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT, Y'ALL?

09:17.340 --> 09:19.172
I'D ACTUALLY LIKE
TO MAKE A TOAST

09:19.180 --> 09:21.137
TO THE BEVERLY EAGLES.

09:21.140 --> 09:22.926
CONGRATULATIONS
ON DOING SOMETHING

09:22.930 --> 09:25.262
ME AND MY BOYS
NEVER COULD...

09:25.270 --> 09:28.262
MAKING IT TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP
WITH MY BOY SPENCER.

09:28.270 --> 09:30.602
JORDAN: HEY, THAT'S
FINE, ALL RIGHT?

09:30.610 --> 09:32.271
TAKE SPENCE ANY DAY
OF THE WEEK.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.640
CHRIS: YOU KNOW WHAT?
Y'ALL SHOULD ACTUALLY

09:35.650 --> 09:37.061
COME THROUGH TO MY CRIB
TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:37.070 --> 09:38.617
MY PARENTS ARE OUT
OF TOWN, SO YOU KNOW

09:38.620 --> 09:40.110
I'M THROWING A PARTY.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.656
IT COULD BE ONE
LAST CELEBRATION

09:41.660 --> 09:44.197
BEFORE WE CRUSH
Y'ALL DREAMS NEXT WEEK.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.111
<i>1). A PARTY?</i>

09:46.120 --> 09:48.327
I'M ON IT.

09:48.330 --> 09:49.957
HE'S ON IT.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.200
OK, HOW DOES HE
KNOW MY ADDRESS?

09:54.210 --> 09:55.792
LEILA: I THINK
A PARTY COULD BE FUN.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.461
YEAH, WE CAN ALL
GO TOGETHER.

09:57.470 --> 09:58.881
-SOUNDS FINE.
-FINE?

09:58.890 --> 10:00.460
SPENCE, YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND, MAN.

10:00.470 --> 10:02.097
YOU KNOW MY PARTIES
ARE LIT.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.465
HEH. YEAH.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.768
SPENCE, I'M NOT...

10:07.100 --> 10:09.182
HEY, CAN I STAY OVER
AGAIN TONIGHT?

10:09.190 --> 10:11.978
YEAH. YEAH, NO, STAY
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.859
HAVE YOU TOLD SPENCER HOW
FREAKED OUT YOU ARE TO GO HOME?

10:14.860 --> 10:16.988
UM, NO. HE THINKS
I'M STAYING THERE

10:16.990 --> 10:19.197
'CAUSE I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HIM.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.363
I'M GONNA GET A WATER.
YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING?

10:22.370 --> 10:24.190
-MM-MMM.
-NO.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.616
HEY.

10:27.620 --> 10:30.783
HEY. UH, PICK-UP
FOR ASHER.

10:30.790 --> 10:33.339
UH, CAN I GET A WATER,
PLEASE? THANK YOU.

10:33.340 --> 10:35.411
SO, YOU JOINING US OR...

10:35.420 --> 10:37.218
NO, TAKE OUT.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.042
I GOT TO GET HOME, TRY AND
GET SOME FOOD INTO MY DAD.

10:40.050 --> 10:42.712
YEAH, I DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING,

10:42.720 --> 10:44.757
BUT HE SEEMED A LITTLE
DRUNK AT THE GAME.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.479
-IS HE OK?
-YEAH, HE'S FINE.

10:49.020 --> 10:52.012
LOOK, HE'S ALWAYS
LIKED TO DRINK. IT'S JUST...

10:52.020 --> 10:54.352
GOTTEN WORSE
SINCE MY MOM LEFT.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.853
HE'LL BE FINE IF HE CAN GET
BACK ON HIS FEET, THOUGH.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.851
I MEAN, WELL,
MY MOM KEEPS SAYING

10:59.860 --> 11:01.521
THAT SHE NEEDS HELP
WITH FUNDRAISING,

11:01.530 --> 11:03.612
I MEAN, AND YOUR DAD HAS
CONNECTIONS WITH THE BOOSTERS.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.019
I CAN SEE IF SHE'LL
MEET WITH HIM.

11:05.030 --> 11:07.192
YOU DON'T NEED TO
KEEP SAVING ME. I'M GOOD.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.361
I'M NOT TRYING
TO SAVE YOU.

11:08.370 --> 11:11.249
I'M JUST OFFERING
TO HELP YOUR DAD.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.627
YOU SURE?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.621
DOESN'T HURT TO ASK.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.338
BUT, LOOK, JUST DON'T
GET YOUR HOPES UP, OK?

11:17.340 --> 11:19.661
IF HE HAS A PROBLEM,
THERE'S NO EASY FIX.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.422
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.387
THANKS, LIV.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.947
THANKS FOR COMING.

11:47.950 --> 11:50.533
THANKS FOR GIVING ME
A CHANCE.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.702
DILLON SEEMS TO THINK
YOU DESERVE ONE.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.632
I LIKE LEILA.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.256
SHE SEEMS NICE.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.638
-YOU BARELY MET HER.
-OH, SO SHE'S NOT NICE?

12:10.640 --> 12:13.689
NO, SHE IS. I JUST DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT HER.

12:13.690 --> 12:16.648
SPENCER, I'M TRYING.

12:16.650 --> 12:19.529
YOU SAID THAT DILLON WANTED
YOU TO GIVE ME A CHANCE.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.521
DILLON DOESN'T REMEMBER
HAVING A DAD,

12:21.530 --> 12:23.658
AND THEN ONE DAY
HE'S JUST GONE.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.561
NO NOTE, NO GOOD-BYE,
NO NOTHING.

12:26.570 --> 12:29.870
LOOKING AT YOU NOW BRINGS
ALL THAT ANGER BACK, MAN.

12:29.870 --> 12:31.690
I WAS ANGRY
FOR TOO LONG,

12:31.700 --> 12:33.828
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
THAT WAY NO MORE.

12:33.830 --> 12:38.336
HEY...NO ONE SAID THIS IS
GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.581
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.581
ABOUT WHAT?

12:42.590 --> 12:44.547
WHAT, MY FIRST GAME?
MY FIRST DATE?

12:44.550 --> 12:46.632
DILLON'S FIRST DAY
OF SCHOOL?

12:46.640 --> 12:50.099
IT DON'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU
WEREN'T THERE FOR ANY OF IT, MAN.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.057
IT DON'T CHANGE THE
FACT THAT FOR 8 YEARS

12:52.060 --> 12:54.882
YOU COULD NOT PICK UP THE
PHONE AND CALL YOUR KIDS.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.067
OR DID YOU TRY,
AND THAT'S JUST

12:59.070 --> 13:00.856
ANOTHER THING MOM'S
LIED TO ME ABOUT?

13:00.860 --> 13:02.646
GO EASY
ON YOUR MOM, MAN.

13:02.650 --> 13:05.199
IT TAKES TWO PEOPLE
TO RUIN A MARRIAGE,

13:05.200 --> 13:07.567
AND I DID MORE
THAN MY PART.

13:07.570 --> 13:10.232
I GAVE UP MY DREAM OF PLAYING
IN THE NFL FOR YOUR MOTHER,

13:10.240 --> 13:12.322
AND I NEVER LET HER
FORGET IT.

13:12.330 --> 13:14.651
I RESENTED HER,
PUSHED HER AWAY.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.960
WHEN SHE FINALLY GAVE ME
AN EXCUSE TO LEAVE, I TOOK IT.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.122
SO YOU'RE RIGHT
TO HATE ME,

13:20.130 --> 13:22.667
BUT DON'T TAKE IT OUT
ON YOUR MOTHER.

13:22.670 --> 13:26.220
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY BREAK'S OVER.

13:26.220 --> 13:29.042
I'M SORRY I WASTED
YOUR TIME.

13:34.430 --> 13:37.479
PREACH: SHOOT FOR 10,
SHOOT FOR 10. LET'S GO.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.687
AHH!

13:39.690 --> 13:42.648
MONEY GONE. GIVE ME THAT.
GIVE ME ALL THAT.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.857
PREACH, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.988
MAN: SECOND COMING COMES

13:46.990 --> 13:48.810
HEY, I'M STILL IN IT.

13:48.820 --> 13:53.781
MAN: DID YOU FIRE 'EM

13:53.790 --> 13:58.990
LOOK, SO I'M THINKING
TYRONE MIGHT NOT HAVE TO DIE.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.243
THAT'S THE CODE, COOP. I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED JUSTICE FOR SHAWN.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.708
I DO, BUT YOU ALREADY GOT
TWO STRIKES AGAINST YOU.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.213
YOU GET BUSTED, YOU'RE
GOING BACK TO JAIL FOR LIFE.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.086
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU
CARE ABOUT ME.

14:09.090 --> 14:12.640
THIS IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU
AIN'T DOWN WITH YOUR ROLE IN ALL THIS.

14:12.640 --> 14:15.018
IT'S A DIFFERENT BEAST
WHEN YOU SET IT IN MOTION.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.933
THAT'S WHY THIS LIFE AIN'T
NEVER BEEN FOR YOU, COOP.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.762
LOOK, THERE'S OTHER WAYS
TO GET RID OF TYRONE.

14:20.770 --> 14:22.568
WE COULD RUN HIM OUT
OF TOWN, LET HIM KNOW

14:22.570 --> 14:24.777
HE AIN'T WELCOME
IN CRENSHAW NO MORE.

14:24.780 --> 14:28.148
AND YOU THINK HE'D GO,
JUST LIKE THAT?

14:28.150 --> 14:31.484
HE WOULD IF HE KNEW HIS ONLY
OPTIONS WAS THAT OR DEATH.

14:31.490 --> 14:34.539
COME ON, IT'S WORTH
A TRY, RIGHT?

14:40.330 --> 14:43.493
COME ON, I NEED MORE
THAN A HEAD NOD, PREACH.

14:46.670 --> 14:48.581
LOOK, YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:48.590 --> 14:51.469
THE LAST THING I NEED
IS MY THIRD STRIKE.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.678
HEY, Y'ALL,
I'M BACK IN.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.761
LEILA: HEY.
SPENCER: HEY.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.852
HOW'D THINGS GO
WITH YOUR DAD?

15:06.860 --> 15:08.521
ABOUT AS I EXPECTED.

15:08.530 --> 15:10.908
ANY CHANCE YOU WANTED IT
TO GO THAT WAY?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.309
HEH. PROBABLY.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.027
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.192
WHO--WHO NEEDS
A FATHER ANYWAY?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.861
YOU AND I
TURNED OUT OK.

15:17.870 --> 15:20.362
NAH, YOU TURNED OUT
BETTER THAN OK.

15:20.370 --> 15:23.249
AT LEAST YOU STILL HAVE
AN AMAZING MOTHER.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.456
WHAT?

15:26.460 --> 15:28.121
HEY, WHAT IS IT?

15:28.130 --> 15:30.258
SPENCER,
YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.672
IF SOMETHING IS BOTHERING
YOU, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.796
BESIDES, IT'S GRACE.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.962
HOW BAD CAN IT BE?

15:38.310 --> 15:40.881
MY MOM CHEATED ON MY DAD
WITH COACH BAKER.

15:40.890 --> 15:43.222
THAT'S WHY HE LEFT.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.772
LAURA: BABE,
GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.613
LOOK WHO CAME
TO SEE YOU.

15:57.620 --> 15:58.530
GREAT.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.861
WELL, I'll LEAVE
YOU BOYS ALONE.

16:00.870 --> 16:03.532
COREY, IT WAS REALLY
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.035
PLAY NICE.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.452
-MM-HMM.
-HE MISSES HIS SON.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.041
ALWAYS LIKED LAURA.

16:14.050 --> 16:15.461
WHY ARE YOU
IN MY HOUSE?

16:15.470 --> 16:17.711
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT SPENCER.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.210
HE'S A RESILIENT KID.

16:19.220 --> 16:21.928
THERE'S NO NEED TO START
WORRYING ABOUT HIM NOW.

16:21.930 --> 16:23.477
ARE WE DONE HERE?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.892
I'M GUESSING LAURA
DON'T KNOW THE TRUTH.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.265
IS THAT A THREAT?

16:27.270 --> 16:29.648
I'M NOT HERE TO RUIN
ANYONE'S LIFE.

16:29.650 --> 16:31.812
I WASN'T EVEN GONNA TELL
SPENCER ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.356
I'M SURPRISED YOU DID.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.691
WELL, THAT WAS GRACE.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.441
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

16:36.450 --> 16:38.987
SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM
HEARING IT FROM YOU.

16:38.990 --> 16:41.652
SHE WAS ALWAYS
A SMART WOMAN.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.582
LOOK,

16:47.590 --> 16:49.581
I KNOW YOU THINK I
BLAME YOU FOR EVERYTHING

16:49.590 --> 16:52.582
THAT HAPPENED,
AND FOR A WHILE, I DID.

16:52.590 --> 16:55.582
BUT EVENTUALLY, YOU HAVE TO
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF YOUR MISTAKES

16:55.590 --> 16:57.467
AND HOPE YOUR FAMILY
FORGIVES YOU.

16:57.470 --> 17:01.839
THAT'S WHAT GRACE DID. THAT'S
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO NOW.

17:01.850 --> 17:04.512
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
DO THE SAME.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.316
WOMAN: THE POLL NUMBERS
AREN'T GREAT.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.027
YOU'RE NOT COMING
ACROSS AS RELATABLE.

17:15.030 --> 17:17.818
VOTERS SEE YOU AS JUST ANOTHER
RICH BEVERLY HILLS WOMAN.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.653
I'M RELATABLE. HOW--
HOW AM I NOT RELATABLE?

17:20.660 --> 17:22.150
'COURSE YOU'RE
RELATABLE, BABY.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.117
YOU'RE STRONG,
SMART, SUCCESSFUL.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.828
RIGHT. STRONG,
SMART, SUCCESSFUL,

17:26.829 --> 17:28.958
RICH BEVERLY HILLS
WOMAN.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.450
NOT HELPING, OLIVIA.

17:30.460 --> 17:33.964
LUCKILY, I HAVE THE
SOLUTION-- YOUR FAMILY.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.041
THEY'RE THE PERFECT IMAGE
FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.132
THEY'RE CHARMING,
ATTRACTIVE.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.426
DIVERSE.

17:39.430 --> 17:40.920
THAT DOESN'T HURT.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.762
GO BACK TO THE
ATTRACTIVE PART REAL QUICK.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.228
I'M JUST NOT SURE
I'M COMFORTABLE

17:45.230 --> 17:47.050
USING MY FAMILY
LIKE THAT.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.188
WHY NOT? WE'RE
STUFFING ENVELOPES.

17:49.190 --> 17:51.511
IF IT'LL HELP YOU
WIN, I'M IN.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.352
I'll SET UP THE PHOTO
SHOOT THIS WEEKEND.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.395
PHOTO SHOOT?

17:54.400 --> 17:55.982
DO YOU THINK SPENCER
WOULD BE WILLING TO JOIN?

17:55.990 --> 17:57.731
HE'S LIKE FAMILY, RIGHT?

17:57.740 --> 17:59.151
YEAH, AND HE'S
FROM CRENSHAW.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.696
THAT DOESN'T HURT.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.112
-THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, YEAH.
-YEAH, MAYBE WE CAN GET...

18:03.120 --> 18:06.158
-WHO IS SHE?
-WHO IS--HA HA!

18:16.510 --> 18:19.389
GRACE: IS YOUR PLAN
TO AVOID ME FOREVER?

18:19.390 --> 18:23.759
BECAUSE IF NOT, I REALLY WOULD LIKE
THE CHANCE TO TALK TO MY SON AGAIN.

18:42.700 --> 18:47.194
YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU AND
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER ARE MY WORLD,

18:47.200 --> 18:49.862
THAT THE LAST THING I WOULD
WANT TO DO IS TO HURT YOU.

18:49.870 --> 18:52.749
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE LIED TO ME.

18:59.550 --> 19:02.542
YOU WERE SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL, HAPPY BOY.

19:02.550 --> 19:06.180
WHEN COREY LEFT, I REMEMBER
LOOKING INTO YOUR EYES,

19:06.180 --> 19:11.516
AND I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO BREAK YOUR
HEART NO MORE THAN WHAT IT ALREADY WAS.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.228
AND THEN WHEN HE
NEVER CAME BACK,

19:14.230 --> 19:18.519
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO HATE
THE ONLY PARENT YOU HAD LEFT.

19:19.900 --> 19:23.404
AND AS TIME WENT ON,
I JUST...

19:23.410 --> 19:26.482
I THOUGHT IT WAS BEST TO
LEAVE THE PAIN BURIED IN THE PAST.

19:26.490 --> 19:29.619
ONLY YOU DIDN'T.
IT STAYED WITH ME,

19:29.620 --> 19:32.373
EVERY DAY WHEN I WONDERED
IF I WAS THE REASON HE LEFT.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.872
I KEPT THINKING MAYBE
THERE WAS SOMETHING

19:34.880 --> 19:36.700
I COULD HAVE DONE
TO KEEP HIM HERE.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.508
I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.377
YOU ALSO SAID
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.838
AND THEN YOU LET ME
MOVE IN WITH COACH BAKER

19:43.840 --> 19:45.751
WHEN HE WAS
THE REASON HE LEFT.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.422
BILLY WASN'T THE REASON
COREY LEFT.

19:48.430 --> 19:50.307
COREY AND I WAS
THE REASON, BUT I KNEW

19:50.310 --> 19:52.096
THAT YOU WOULDN'T
SEE IT THAT WAY.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.808
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MOVED
IF YOU KNEW THE TRUTH.

19:54.810 --> 19:57.142
AND I JUST WANTED YOU TO HAVE
A CHANCE AT A BETTER FUTURE.

19:57.150 --> 19:59.608
BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MY DECISION TO MAKE.

19:59.610 --> 20:02.068
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT AS A PARENT,

20:02.070 --> 20:04.619
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS,

20:04.620 --> 20:07.942
AND IT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS
BE THE RIGHT ONES.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.752
DID YOU GO
SEE HIM AGAIN?

20:28.680 --> 20:30.341
I JUST NEEDED
TO TALK TO HIM.

20:30.350 --> 20:33.012
THAT'S ALL
I WANTED TO DO.

20:34.690 --> 20:37.057
WHAT DID YOU
TALK ABOUT?

20:37.060 --> 20:39.722
DID HE SAY WHY
HE LEFT?

20:44.240 --> 20:47.528
HE, UM...

20:51.290 --> 20:53.281
IT WAS LIKE MOM SAID.

20:53.290 --> 20:55.998
THEY JUST GREW APART,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.788
SO HE HAD TO LEAVE.

20:58.790 --> 21:02.670
BUT IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH US.

21:02.670 --> 21:05.469
A'IGHT? I PROMISE.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.973
OOH!

21:14.980 --> 21:16.300
GIRL. YEAH.

21:16.310 --> 21:17.516
OH, MY GOD.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.181
SEEING THAT DUDE
LOOKING AT YOU?

21:19.190 --> 21:21.101
WHAT? WHAT IF HE WAS
LOOKING AT YOU?

21:21.110 --> 21:22.566
THEN HE HAD
TWO LAZY EYES

21:22.570 --> 21:24.106
BECAUSE THEY WAS BOTH
POINTED IN YOUR DIRECTION.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.817
SHUT UP.
YOU CAN HAVE HIM.

21:25.820 --> 21:27.356
GREAT.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.988
YO, COOP.
YOU ROLLING TONIGHT?

21:29.990 --> 21:31.116
ROLLING WHERE?

21:32.870 --> 21:34.360
GIVE ME A SECOND.

21:34.370 --> 21:36.281
YEAH.

21:36.290 --> 21:38.497
WHAT'S UP?

21:38.500 --> 21:40.582
I'M GETTING PAYBACK
FOR SHAWN.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.207
FIGURED SINCE YOU TWO
WERE CLOSE, YOU'D WANT IN.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.759
THAT AIN'T HAPPENING NO MORE.
YOU DIDN'T TALK TO PREACH?

21:45.760 --> 21:48.331
YEAH, HE'S THE ONE
PICKING US UP.

21:52.260 --> 21:54.058
ALL RIGHT.

21:54.060 --> 21:56.472
WELL, YEAH, I--I GUESS
I'll SEE YOU TONIGHT.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.142
ALL RIGHT.
FOR SURE.

21:59.150 --> 22:01.471
IS EVERYTHING OK?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.687
NO, IT'S NOT OK.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.819
THEY'RE STILL GOING
AFTER TYRONE, MAN.

22:06.820 --> 22:10.404
I GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE THEY DO.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.661
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

22:22.670 --> 22:25.833
I WANTED TO MEET
WITH YOU, TOO.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.292
DID YOU LOVE MY MOM?

22:32.300 --> 22:34.302
OR JUST HATE MY DAD?

22:34.310 --> 22:36.517
UH, WOW.

22:36.520 --> 22:40.400
SPENCER, IT WASN'T--
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.358
SOMETIMES IN LIFE,
THINGS GET MESSY.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.729
YEAH, I KNOW. I'M PART OF THE
MESS Y'ALL TWO NEVER CLEANED UP.

22:47.740 --> 22:50.778
NO, WE DIDN'T.

22:52.620 --> 22:55.533
YOU KNOW, DILLON ASKED ME
THIS MORNING WHY POPS LEFT.

22:55.540 --> 22:59.363
AND I COULDN'T TELL HIM.
JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

22:59.370 --> 23:02.670
AND THEN I REALIZED
IT WASN'T MY PLACE.

23:04.380 --> 23:07.088
I AIN'T GONNA TELL
YOUR FAMILY, MAN...

23:07.090 --> 23:10.253
SO IF YOU THINK IT'S BETTER
FOR THEM NOT TO KNOW,

23:10.260 --> 23:11.967
THAT'S YOUR CALL.

23:11.970 --> 23:14.177
I'M GONNA TELL
LAURA TODAY.

23:14.180 --> 23:16.592
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

23:16.600 --> 23:19.979
TO BE HONEST,
YOUR FATHER.

23:19.980 --> 23:21.687
WHAT, HE THREATEN
TO TELL THEM?

23:21.690 --> 23:24.398
NO, NO...

23:24.400 --> 23:27.392
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.027
HE REMINDED ME

23:29.030 --> 23:32.352
THAT YOU CAN'T START
THE HEALING PROCESS

23:32.360 --> 23:36.365
UNTIL YOU'RE MAN ENOUGH
TO OWN YOUR MISTAKES.

23:38.540 --> 23:41.498
TV ANNOUNCER: WE SAW 3 CARS
CRASHING DURING QUALIFYING YESTERDAY.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.992
HAD TO PULL OUT
THOSE BACK-UP CARS

23:44.000 --> 23:45.707
AND HEAD TO THE BACK
OF THE PACK.

23:45.710 --> 23:48.418
I THINK THE DRIVERS ARE STILL
GETTING USED TO THE DRAG...

23:48.420 --> 23:50.252
OLIVIA BAKER CALLED.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.422
SHE SAID YOU DIDN'T SHOW
UP FOR YOUR INTERVIEW.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.080
YEAH, I GAVE IT
SOME THOUGHT.

23:54.090 --> 23:57.094
I'M NOT GONNA EVEN VOTE
FOR LAURA BAKER.

23:57.100 --> 24:00.593
WHY WOULD I WORK FOR HER?
JOB'S BENEATH ME.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.479
AND LYING AROUND
GETTING DRUNK ISN'T?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.317
HEY!

24:07.320 --> 24:08.970
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?

24:08.980 --> 24:11.358
ARE YOU SO SCARED OF
FAILING YOU WON'T EVEN TRY?

24:11.360 --> 24:15.274
I'M NOT THE LOSER WHO HAD TO
GROVEL TO STAY ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.829
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THE
ONLY ONE THAT LOST EVERYTHING.

24:17.830 --> 24:21.539
I DID, TOO. THE DIFFERENCE IS I'M
STILL TRYING AND YOU'VE GIVEN UP.

24:21.540 --> 24:22.780
YOU FINISHED?

24:22.790 --> 24:24.417
YOU DON'T WANT
A LOSER FOR A SON?

24:24.420 --> 24:26.787
WELL, GUESS WHAT, I DON'T
WANT A LOSER FOR A FATHER.

24:26.790 --> 24:28.372
SO DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO.

24:28.380 --> 24:31.042
I'M DONE CARING
ABOUT YOU.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.631
-HEY, BABE.
-HEY.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.132
DO YOU THINK THAT I

24:43.140 --> 24:46.644
SHOULD END MY SPEECH
WITH "THANK YOU,"

24:46.650 --> 24:49.563
OR IS THAT NOT
RELATABLE ENOUGH?

24:49.570 --> 24:50.856
UM--

24:50.860 --> 24:53.773
-"PEACE OUT," MAYBE?

24:53.780 --> 24:57.318
IT WAS A JOKE...APPARENTLY
NOT A VERY FUNNY ONE.

24:57.320 --> 25:01.200
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED
TO TELL YOU, BABY.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.611
OK.

25:02.620 --> 25:04.782
IS EVERYTHING OK?

25:06.330 --> 25:07.991
UM--

25:08.000 --> 25:09.661
HEY...

25:09.670 --> 25:12.298
WHATEVER IT IS, WE'LL--

25:12.300 --> 25:15.338
WE'LL TACKLE IT HEAD ON
LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

25:17.180 --> 25:20.673
I HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH GRACE JAMES.

25:20.680 --> 25:25.345
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
AND IT WAS RIGHT AFTER

25:25.350 --> 25:28.263
I BLEW OUT MY KNEE
AND MY CAREER WAS OVER.

25:28.270 --> 25:32.025
AND I WAS DEPRESSED
AND I WAS ANGRY,

25:32.030 --> 25:35.853
AND ONE NIGHT YOU AND I
JUST GOT INTO A HUGE FIGHT,

25:35.860 --> 25:40.696
AND...I FOUND MYSELF
IN CRENSHAW AND...

25:40.700 --> 25:43.192
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I WAS
IN MY OWN NEIGHBOR--

25:43.200 --> 25:45.908
MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD
WITH MY OLD GIRLFRIEND,

25:45.910 --> 25:48.629
AND I FELT LIKE
MY OLD SELF,

25:48.630 --> 25:50.951
A FOOTBALL STAR

25:50.960 --> 25:53.088
THAT EVERYBODY USED
TO CHEER FOR, AND

25:53.090 --> 25:56.219
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

25:56.220 --> 25:59.292
IT--IT ONLY
HAPPENED ONE TIME.

25:59.300 --> 26:00.677
I'M SORRY...

26:00.680 --> 26:03.342
I--I DIDN'T
TELL YOU SOONER.

26:03.350 --> 26:07.344
AND I KNOW THIS IS A LOT,
BUT 1 REALIZED THAT, UM,

26:07.350 --> 26:10.900
THE ONLY WAY I COULD FIX THIS--THE
ONLY WAY I COULD FIX THIS WAS IF

26:10.900 --> 26:12.937
I--I WAS COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU.

26:12.940 --> 26:16.649
YOU'RE SUCH A COWARD...

26:16.650 --> 26:18.357
YOU KNOW THAT?

26:18.360 --> 26:21.113
THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE
TELLING ME THIS NOW

26:21.120 --> 26:24.943
IS BECAUSE COREY'S BACK
AND BECAUSE...

26:24.950 --> 26:28.614
MY CAMPAIGN IS
DIGGING UP THE PAST.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.622
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:30.630 --> 26:32.416
SCREW THE CAMPAIGN,

26:32.420 --> 26:35.128
BECAUSE OUR
PERFECT FAMILY ENDED

26:35.130 --> 26:38.122
THE DAY THAT YOU
BETRAYED US.

26:38.130 --> 26:43.307
AND YOU MOVED HER SON
INTO OUR HOUSE.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.979
I HAVE--I HAVE NOT BEEN
WITH GRACE SINCE.

26:47.980 --> 26:51.644
I PROMISE. I PROMISE.

26:55.650 --> 26:58.483
UP UNTIL TODAY, THAT MIGHT
HAVE MEANT SOMETHING.

27:00.110 --> 27:01.657
LAURA, PLEASE.
WAIT. LAURA.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.480
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE WORST PART

27:03.490 --> 27:06.289
IS NOT EVEN THAT YOU
HAD AN AFFAIR.

27:08.250 --> 27:11.072
IT'S THAT YOU HAD
TO GO TO GRACE JAMES

27:11.080 --> 27:13.082
TO FEEL WHOLE AGAIN.

27:13.090 --> 27:16.082
NOT YOUR WIFE...

27:16.090 --> 27:19.219
AND THE MOTHER
OF YOUR CHILDREN.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.631
GOD!

27:25.470 --> 27:28.679
UP UNTIL A MINUTE AGO,
I LOVED YOU MORE THAN

27:28.680 --> 27:30.887
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.

27:30.890 --> 27:34.349
I--I DON'T KNOW--
I'M GONNA FIX THIS.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.476
I CAN FIX THIS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW--

27:36.480 --> 27:39.438
-BUT I CAN--I CAN
TALK TO THE KIDS.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.852
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:41.860 --> 27:45.524
YOU HAVE DONE
MORE THAN ENOUGH.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.949
I'll TALK TO OUR KIDS.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.533
MAN: YOU CAN TRY
TO RUN AWAY

27:54.540 --> 27:58.955
BUT YOU KNOW THE GHOSTS
WILL STAY AND...

27:58.960 --> 28:00.962
OLIVIA, LAUGHING:
WHY?

28:03.260 --> 28:07.424
SO COME IN
AND CLOSE THE DOOR...

28:07.430 --> 28:11.936
I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT
THAT-- I THOUGHT THAT...

28:15.560 --> 28:17.722
MOM, YOU OK?

28:17.730 --> 28:22.395
NO, I'M NOT OK.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.357
SIT DOWN.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.239
I HAVE SOMETHING I
NEED TO TELL YOU.

28:40.550 --> 28:42.541
HEY, COOP, HOLD UP.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.757
LET ME GUESS.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.218
PATIENCE CALLED.

28:47.220 --> 28:49.348
YO, REMIND ME TO DELETE
YOUR NUMBER OUT HER PHONE.

28:49.350 --> 28:51.557
SHE'S JUST WORRIED ABOUT
YOU, A'IGHT? WE BOTH ARE.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.881
SPENCE, I'M NOT DUMB.
TYRONE IS MEETING ME

28:53.890 --> 28:55.597
IN A PUBLIC PLACE
WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.309
YEAH, WELL, NOW YOU GOT
ONE MORE, SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

29:04.280 --> 29:05.850
TYRONE: LEAVE TOWN?

29:05.860 --> 29:08.079
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M
JUST GONNA PICK UP AND LEAVE?

29:08.080 --> 29:11.289
COOP: YOU GOT NO CHOICE. YOU'RE NOT
WELCOME HERE IN CRENSHAW NO MORE.

29:11.290 --> 29:13.452
-THAT'S A BOLD STATEMENT, LITTLE GIRL.
-HEY.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.167
HOPE YOU PACKING SOMETHING
STRONGER THAN SPENCER.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.070
LOOK, YOU AIN'T GOT TO STEP
TO COOP, ALL RIGHT?

29:17.080 --> 29:19.208
SHE THE ONLY FRIEND
YOU GOT RIGHT NOW,

29:19.210 --> 29:21.372
AND SHE GIVING YOU
A CHANCE TO SAVE YOURSELF.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.508
GIVING ME A CHANCE?
OH, IT'S LIKE THAT.

29:23.510 --> 29:26.548
YO, EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT YOU DID
TO SHAWN, AND THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU.

29:26.550 --> 29:28.791
IS THAT RIGHT? WHO'S
COMING FOR ME, EXACTLY?

29:28.800 --> 29:30.302
YOUR OWN BLOODS.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.267
COOP: MIGHT EVEN BE
YOUR HOMEBOYS OVER THERE.

29:32.270 --> 29:35.183
AND IT'S GOING DOWN SOON,
SO THE WAY I SEE IT,

29:35.190 --> 29:39.354
EITHER YOU LEAVE TOWN
OR YOU END UP LIKE SHAWN.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.273
WHAT'S STOPPING ME FROM
PUTTING Y'ALL DOWN RIGHT HERE?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.645
COME ON, MAN, EVEN YOU
AIN'T THAT CRAZY.

29:43.650 --> 29:45.982
LOOK, TYRONE, THIS
AIN'T YOUR 'HOOD NO MORE,

29:45.990 --> 29:48.027
AND THOSE AIN'T
YOUR PEOPLE.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.520
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING

29:49.530 --> 29:51.692
YOU DIDN'T GIVE SHAWN,
AND THAT'S A WAY OUT.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.862
-WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
-'CAUSE I DON'T WANT ANYBODY

29:53.870 --> 29:56.202
TO DIE IF THEY
DON'T HAVE TO.

29:56.210 --> 29:57.996
I KNEW YOU
WERE SOFT, COOP.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.662
COMPASSION DON'T
MAKE ME SOFT.

30:00.670 --> 30:02.411
IT'S OVER, TY.

30:09.890 --> 30:12.552
GUESS Y'ALL
LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.220
FEELING IT UP
IN HERE, BABY.

30:22.230 --> 30:24.437
YOU'RE FEELING IT
UP IN HERE, BABY.

30:27.150 --> 30:29.903
BEVERLY IN THE
HIZOUSE, BITCHES.

30:29.910 --> 30:32.151
MAN: SWIM TEAM IN IT,
THAT'S A POOL HOUSE...

30:32.160 --> 30:33.901
THERE GOES
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

30:33.910 --> 30:35.821
LIKE SCHOOL'S OUT

30:35.830 --> 30:38.538
MY MAN DROPPING BEATS.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.281
MAN ON SONG: SO WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?

30:40.290 --> 30:41.951
GIRL: MICHAEL JACKSON.

30:43.170 --> 30:44.831
MAN: THROW MY HANDS UP...

30:54.970 --> 30:57.473
I NEED A DRINK.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.347
YEAH, MAKES TWO OF US.

31:03.610 --> 31:05.271
MAN: WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND, BOY?
LET IT GO

31:05.280 --> 31:09.399
I'll BE PUMPING GAS
LIKE TEXACO

31:09.400 --> 31:12.028
HEY, I COULD REALLY USE
A FRIEND TONIGHT.

31:12.030 --> 31:13.737
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

31:13.740 --> 31:15.538
UM...

31:15.540 --> 31:19.408
WELL, A NEW FATHER
WOULD BE A GOOD START.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.367
WE JUST FOUND OUT
HE HAD AN AFFAIR

31:21.370 --> 31:23.498
WITH SPENCER'S MOM.

31:23.500 --> 31:26.629
OLIVIA, I'M SO SORRY.

31:26.630 --> 31:28.462
I KNOW IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO,

31:28.470 --> 31:31.838
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT
HURT ANY LESS.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.719
WAIT. YOU KNEW?

31:34.720 --> 31:37.633
UM, SPENCER TOLD ME
YESTERDAY.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.222
WAIT.
SPENCER KNEW, TOO?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.221
LIV, HE JUST FOUND OUT.
WE DIDN'T--

31:41.230 --> 31:43.016
WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO HANDLE IT.

31:43.020 --> 31:45.762
SO WHY EVEN TRY,
RIGHT?

31:45.770 --> 31:47.181
LIV.

31:47.190 --> 31:49.568
MAN: MY FACE IS YELLOW,
BUT MY HEART IS BLUE

31:49.570 --> 31:51.698
FILM ME A MOVIE,
SENT TO HOLLYWOOD

31:51.700 --> 31:53.862
I DO IT LIKE USHER,
NICE AND SLOW

31:53.870 --> 31:55.406
GIRL, YOU GOT ME
LIKE "FROZEN"...

31:55.410 --> 31:57.367
YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE.

31:57.370 --> 31:59.407
YOU FREAKED OUT WHEN
WE DIDN'T TELL YOU

31:59.410 --> 32:00.900
ABOUT OUR PARENTS
DATING BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL,

32:00.910 --> 32:02.321
AND YOU FIND THIS OUT
AND SAY NOTHING, SPENCE?

32:02.330 --> 32:04.162
-JORDAN.
-I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT YOU, MAN.

32:04.170 --> 32:06.332
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY.
I'M ANGRY, TOO.

32:06.340 --> 32:07.910
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER, HUH?

32:07.920 --> 32:09.001
YO, YOU SHOVE HIM
ONE MORE TIME,

32:09.010 --> 32:10.751
THERE'S GONNA BE
A PROBLEM.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.001
- LET IT GO
- LET IT GO, LET IT GO

32:13.010 --> 32:15.172
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.421
YOU KNOW THAT I BALL
LIKE AMBER ROSE

32:17.430 --> 32:20.013
- LABEL ME LIKE INTERSCOPE

32:20.020 --> 32:21.510
STRIP CLUB, WE THROW
PLENTY, THOUGH

32:21.520 --> 32:23.181

32:23.190 --> 32:24.760
A HUNNID BAND,
GOT THE CASH OUT

32:24.770 --> 32:26.397
LITTLE MAMA BEND IT OVER,

32:26.400 --> 32:28.141

- WORD

32:29.190 --> 32:30.772
YOU AIN'T RIDIN'...

32:37.530 --> 32:39.282
JUST TO BE
IN YOUR THOUGHTS

32:39.290 --> 32:42.203
AND I AIN'T GONNA DO IT
'CAUSE YOU SAID I CAN

32:42.210 --> 32:44.747
NO.

32:44.750 --> 32:46.878
UM, CAN I HAVE
MY BEER BACK?

32:46.880 --> 32:49.042
LOOK, I CAN'T HAVE
TWO PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

32:49.050 --> 32:51.200
GOING DOWN THE SAME HOLE
ON THE SAME DAY.

32:51.210 --> 32:54.919
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
-IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:54.930 --> 32:56.921
-I'M ENJOYING MYSELF.
-YOU MEAN THROWING AWAY YOUR SOBRIETY.

32:56.930 --> 33:00.173
-IT'S THE SAME THING.
-WHY DON'T WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

33:00.180 --> 33:02.729
I--I'M HERE.
I CAN LISTEN--NO.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.051
FINE, I'll JUST POUR
MYSELF ANOTHER ONE.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.391
THEN I WILL TAKE
THAT ONE AS WELL.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.890
IT'S ONE BEER,
ASHER. WHO CARES?

33:07.900 --> 33:09.140
- I CARE.
-STOP.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.640
HEY, LIV.
HEY, WHERE YOU BEEN?

33:10.650 --> 33:12.732
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
ALL NIGHT. YOU ALL RIGHT?

33:12.740 --> 33:13.946
COME HERE.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.440
YEAH, I'M GREAT.

33:15.450 --> 33:17.612
HEY, MAN, CAN YOU
GIVE US A MINUTE?

33:17.620 --> 33:21.488
UH, ACTUALLY, HEY, WE'RE KIND
OF IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

33:21.490 --> 33:23.117
WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK
I INTERRUPTED?

33:23.120 --> 33:25.327
SHE WASN'T HAPPY WITH WHATEVER
YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF,

33:25.330 --> 33:26.707
SO I THINK YOU SHOULD
GIVE US THAT MINUTE.

33:26.710 --> 33:28.121
ARE YOU REALLY TRYING
TO START SOMETHING?

33:28.130 --> 33:29.120
LOOK, OLIVIA'S HAVING
A ROUGH NIGHT.

33:29.130 --> 33:30.666
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

33:30.670 --> 33:32.126
I DON'T NEED ADVICE ON
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF--

33:32.130 --> 33:33.291
HEY, ENOUGH.

33:33.300 --> 33:34.620
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

33:34.630 --> 33:36.632
-LIV--
-DON'T NEED ANYONE'S HELP.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.882
BRO, WHAT'S UP?
YOU GOOD?

33:43.890 --> 33:46.894
-WHAT UP?
-YEAH.

33:46.900 --> 33:50.109
I IMAGINED MY POPS
COMING BACK FOR YEARS,

33:50.110 --> 33:53.102
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE.

33:53.110 --> 33:54.987
I NEVER PICTURED THIS.

33:54.990 --> 33:57.402
DUDE'S BEEN BACK IN TOWN
LESS THAN A MONTH,

33:57.410 --> 33:59.401
AND EVERYBODY'S
ALREADY WORSE OFF.

33:59.410 --> 34:01.401
UH, WHEN I SAID,
"IS YOU GOOD?" I MEANT,

34:01.410 --> 34:04.152
"YOU WANT ANOTHER
DRINK?" HA HA HA!

34:04.160 --> 34:08.370
BUT WE CAN DO THIS, TOO.
WE CAN DO THIS.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.996
YOU KNOW DILLON
WANTS TO SEE HIM?

34:10.000 --> 34:11.161
YEAH.

34:11.170 --> 34:12.831
HOW CAN I LET
THAT HAPPEN, COOP?

34:12.840 --> 34:14.877
HE ABANDONED US.
IF HE REALLY WANTED

34:14.880 --> 34:17.292
TO BE A PART OF OUR LIVES, WHY'D
IT TAKE HIM SO LONG TO COME BACK?

34:17.300 --> 34:18.835
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.547
MAYBE THE SAME THING
THAT KEPT YOUR MOMS

34:20.550 --> 34:23.053
FROM TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH FOR SO LONG,

34:23.060 --> 34:26.382
AND THE THING THAT KEPT ME
FROM COMING OUT TO MY PARENTS.

34:26.389 --> 34:28.016
AND WHAT'S THAT?

34:28.020 --> 34:29.681
SHAME.

34:29.690 --> 34:32.681
I MEAN, IT'S HARD TO
DISAPPOINT THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

34:32.690 --> 34:35.523
I WASN'T ASHAMED
OF BEING GAY,

34:35.530 --> 34:38.693
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT LOSING
THE PEOPLE I WAS CLOSEST TO.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.690
IT TOOK A LOT
FOR ME TO COME OUT.

34:40.699 --> 34:43.158
YEAH, I KNOW.
THIS AIN'T THE SAME THING.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.571
YES, IT IS.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.446
HE GOT TO BE ASHAMED
OF WHAT HE DID.

34:46.449 --> 34:48.703
THAT'S WHY HE
TRYING SO HARD NOW.

34:48.710 --> 34:52.032
LOOK, IT JUST TOOK HIM
A HELL OF A LONG TIME

34:52.040 --> 34:54.121
TO GET THE COURAGE
TO FACE YOU.

34:54.130 --> 34:56.451
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE.

34:56.460 --> 34:59.122
YEAH, IT MIGHT BE
FOR YOU,

34:59.130 --> 35:01.383
BUT IS IT FOR DILLON?

35:03.350 --> 35:05.967
NOW THINK ABOUT IT.

35:13.730 --> 35:18.395
HEY, YO, WATCH
THE KICKS, DADDY'S BOY.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.152
SAY THAT AGAIN.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.650
WHICH PART?

35:21.660 --> 35:23.651
THE PART ABOUT YOU
SCUFFING MY SHOES,

35:23.660 --> 35:25.401
OR THE PART
ABOUT YOU BEING QB1

35:25.410 --> 35:28.619
JUST 'CAUSE YOUR
DADDY'S THE COACH?

35:28.620 --> 35:31.362
HEY! HEY! HEY!

35:33.130 --> 35:35.121
NO, NO, NO.
LET HIM GO, MAN.

35:35.130 --> 35:37.087
EVERYBODY KNOW HE GOT
A WEAK ARM.

35:37.090 --> 35:38.467
YO, CHILL, MAN.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.007
JORDAN: GET OFF ME!
CHRIS: YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:41.010 --> 35:42.546
IT'S TIME FOR YOU BEVERLY
HILLS BOYS TO GO BACK

35:42.550 --> 35:43.676
TO WHERE YOU BELONG,
ALL RIGHT?

35:43.680 --> 35:45.591
YO, PARTY'S OVER!
THE PARTY'S OVER!

35:45.600 --> 35:48.479
IT SUCKS WHEN SOMEBODY
CRASHES YOUR WORLD

35:48.480 --> 35:51.347
AND RUINS EVERYTHING,
DOESN'T IT? GET OFF ME.

36:08.950 --> 36:12.079
-HEY.
-HEY.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.912
UH, YOU WANT
TO GRAB SOME FOOD,

36:13.920 --> 36:16.127
DROWN OUR SORROWS IN
A MILKSHAKE AND PRETEND

36:16.130 --> 36:17.791
THIS NIGHT
NEVER HAPPENED?

36:17.800 --> 36:20.087
I WOULD, BUT...

36:20.090 --> 36:23.173
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET HOME,
MEND THINGS WITH MY MOM.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.830
OK.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.252
-AND YOU GONNA BE OK?
-YEAH, OF COURSE.

36:27.260 --> 36:28.967
I'll SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

36:28.970 --> 36:31.177
ALL RIGHT.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.236
HEY.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.368
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

36:49.370 --> 36:51.031
TIRING.

36:56.290 --> 36:58.281
I GET WHY YOU LIED.

37:00.090 --> 37:02.502
SOMETIMES THE TRUTH
JUST HURTS TOO MUCH,

37:02.510 --> 37:04.672
NO MATTER
WHAT AGE YOU ARE.

37:06.510 --> 37:08.672
YOU OK, BABY?

37:10.140 --> 37:12.302
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
DIFFERENT NOW, AIN'T IT?

37:13.980 --> 37:16.893
NOTHING WE CAN'T HANDLE.

37:16.900 --> 37:19.972
I'M SORRY FOR HOW
I'VE BEEN ACTING, MA.

37:19.980 --> 37:24.019
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT DAD COMING
BACK COULD MEAN FOR YOU AND DILLON.

37:24.030 --> 37:26.158
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME, BABY.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.980
NO, I DO, THOUGH,
AND I GET IT

37:27.990 --> 37:30.732
IF YOU DON'T WANT DAD
BACK IN YOUR LIFE, BUT...

37:30.740 --> 37:32.902
DILLON WANTS TO MEET HIM.

37:34.830 --> 37:37.879
AND I THINK HE DESERVES
A CHANCE TO HAVE A FATHER.

37:40.840 --> 37:44.720
SYML: WHERE DID WE GO?
I LOVE YOU

37:44.720 --> 37:47.212
COME HERE.

37:47.220 --> 37:51.430
WHERE DID WE GO?
I LOVE YOU

37:51.430 --> 37:54.172
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER: WE HAVE
A LOT TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

37:54.180 --> 37:57.184
WHERE, WHERE, WHERE, WHERE,
WHERE DID WE, WE GO?

37:57.190 --> 38:00.478
WHERE, WHERE DID WE,

38:11.030 --> 38:14.534

BILLY: HEY, I THINK, UH,
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.043
I'M DONE CARING
WHAT YOU THINK.

38:25.010 --> 38:27.422
PLEASE. WAIT. WAIT.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.467
I'M SORRY.

38:29.470 --> 38:32.553
I'M SORRY.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.881
YOUR MOM AND YOU

38:34.890 --> 38:37.598
AND YOUR BROTHER MEAN
THE WORLD TO ME.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.809
AND, UH, IT WAS
A MISTAKE.

38:40.810 --> 38:43.814
IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT THAT.

38:45.150 --> 38:48.529
I MEAN, YOU LIED
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

38:48.530 --> 38:51.022
I PROMISE

38:51.030 --> 38:53.738
I WILL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

38:53.740 --> 38:55.742
TO EARN BACK
YOUR TRUST.

38:55.750 --> 38:59.072
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO.

39:05.420 --> 39:07.582
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE

39:07.590 --> 39:09.422
WHEN WE FEEL ALONE
AND UNLOVED.

39:09.430 --> 39:12.593
HEY, UH, YOU GUYS ARE
OPEN ALL NIGHT, RIGHT?

39:12.600 --> 39:13.715
WE ARE.

39:13.720 --> 39:17.679
DON'T WANT
TO GO HOME, HUH?

39:17.680 --> 39:19.842
I KNOW THE FEELING.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.897
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER: THANK YOU
FOR GIVING US THE STRENGTH

39:27.900 --> 39:29.891
TO FACE OUR PROBLEMS.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.619
HEY, ANGIE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:32.620 --> 39:34.440
I TOLD YOU TO CANCEL
THE SHOOT.

39:34.450 --> 39:36.282
THE CAMPAIGN'S OVER.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.746
WELL, UH--

39:37.750 --> 39:39.787
I CALLED HER.

39:39.790 --> 39:41.110
YOU GUYS CAN SET UP.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.589
LOOK, WE'RE NOT
LETTING YOU GIVE UP.

39:46.590 --> 39:48.080
OK? NOT FOR DAD.

39:48.090 --> 39:49.967
NOT FOR ANYONE.

39:49.970 --> 39:53.133
WE WIN AS A FAMILY,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

39:53.140 --> 39:57.259
NOW, UH, IS THIS
RELATABLE ENOUGH, MOM?

39:58.850 --> 40:00.511
YES.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.722
LOVE YOU, MOM.

40:04.730 --> 40:07.028
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER: THANK YOU
FOR GIVING US A SECOND CHANCE

40:07.030 --> 40:10.239
TO GET THINGS RIGHT
WHEN WE MAKE MISTAKES.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.653
DILLON,
THIS IS OUR DAD.

40:13.660 --> 40:17.119
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, SON.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.248
-GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
-YEAH.

40:21.460 --> 40:24.168
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE

40:26.290 --> 40:28.292
BILLY: THANK YOU, GUYS,
FOR DOING THIS.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.418
WE'RE NOT DOING
IT FOR YOU.

40:31.420 --> 40:35.789
ANGIE: JUST TRY
TO LOOK NATURAL, HAPPY.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.464
MAN: TIME ZONE

40:42.810 --> 40:44.596
YOU CAN TAKE A STAND

40:44.600 --> 40:46.602
WHEN YOU WANT TO
MAKE IT RIGHT

40:46.610 --> 40:52.196
CONSTANTLY MISTAKEN

41:12.130 --> 41:18.752

41:18.760 --> 41:21.422
SOMEBODY CALL 9-1-1!
