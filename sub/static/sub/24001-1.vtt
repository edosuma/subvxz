GOOD.
THAT’S GOOD TO HEAR.

01:25:20.581 --> 01:25:22.716
MAYBE THIS TIME,
JUST DON’T WRITE
A BOOK ABOUT IT.

01:25:22.716 --> 01:25:24.618
[LAUGHS]

01:25:24.618 --> 01:25:27.421
THAT’S SOME GOOD ADVICE.
THANK YOU.

01:25:28.288 --> 01:25:29.790
NOW, IF YOU’LL EXCUSE ME,

01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:33.393
I HAVE A LONG-AWAITED VACATION
TO ATTEND TO.

01:25:34.261 --> 01:25:36.630
AH.

01:25:38.432 --> 01:25:41.401
YOU KNOW, YOU’RE A HARD GIRL
TO WHISK AWAY.

01:25:41.401 --> 01:25:43.604
BUT SO WORTH IT.

01:25:43.604 --> 01:25:45.606
YES, YOU ARE.
[CHUCKLING]

01:25:45.606 --> 01:25:48.141
NOT THAT IT’S GONE
TO YOUR HEAD OR ANYTHING.

01:25:48.141 --> 01:25:49.643
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:25:49.643 --> 01:25:51.211
I LEARNED I’M PRETTY SCRAPPY
IN A FIST FIGHT.

01:25:51.211 --> 01:25:52.913
YOU MIGHT NOT
WANNA MESS WITH ME.

01:25:52.913 --> 01:25:54.915
[CLEARS THROAT]

01:25:54.915 --> 01:25:57.217
BUT I LOVE
MESSING WITH YOU.

01:25:57.217 --> 01:26:00.821
WELL, YOU HAVE A WHOLE WEEK
WITH NOTHING TO DO
BUT MESS WITH ME.

01:26:00.821 --> 01:26:04.424
DON’T THREATEN ME
WITH A GOOD TIME.

01:26:04.424 --> 01:26:07.127
I’M GLAD
WE’RE DOING THIS.

01:26:07.127 --> 01:26:09.229
YEAH?
MM.

01:26:10.931 --> 01:26:13.800
I WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER
IF YOU REALLY LIKED ME OR NOT.

01:26:15.135 --> 01:26:18.605
YOU ALWAYS HAVE
THIS WALL UP.

01:26:21.074 --> 01:26:23.544
YEAH.

01:26:23.544 --> 01:26:26.446
THAT WALL’S
COMING DOWN NOW.

01:26:27.347 --> 01:26:29.349
I’M READY.
