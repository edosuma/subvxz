00:03.069 --> 00:07.062
Captain's Log, Stardate 48623.5.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.598
There are 246 elements
known to Federation science.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.874
We believe we have
just discovered the 247th

00:13.947 --> 00:18.247
inside the ring system
of a Class-D planet.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.684
The element has
an unusually large atomic mass--

00:20.754 --> 00:22.449
over 550 nucleons.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.511
And the readings are constant.

00:23.590 --> 00:24.921
The element appears
to be stable.

00:24.991 --> 00:28.154
A stable, transuranic element
inside a natural environment.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.490
This is a first.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.393
Can you imagine what we
could make with this stuff?

00:31.464 --> 00:34.558
Probe casings that could go
into the core of a sun.

00:34.634 --> 00:35.828
Ultrathin reactor shielding.

00:35.902 --> 00:36.891
That's assuming we can mine it.

00:36.970 --> 00:37.994
Ensign, try and locate

00:38.104 --> 00:40.163
the highest concentration
of the element.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.229
The element is present

00:41.307 --> 00:43.275
in most of the asteroids
that comprise the rings.

00:43.343 --> 00:46.608
l can isolate a sample
and beam it aboard.

00:46.679 --> 00:47.805
Or better yet,
maybe we could get

00:47.881 --> 00:49.007
a first-hand look
at this element

00:49.082 --> 00:50.879
in its natural environment.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.441
lt looks like most
of these asteroids

00:53.520 --> 00:55.385
support Class-M atmospheres.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.889
Good idea. Commander,
you're in charge.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.390
Aye, Captain.

00:59.459 --> 01:01.723
Mr. Kim, would you
like to join us?

01:01.795 --> 01:03.387
l wouldn't miss it, sir.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.929
The highest concentration

01:08.001 --> 01:10.435
is about 30 meters
directly ahead.

01:10.503 --> 01:13.028
l'm picking up
a large cavern in there.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.698
The readings are...

01:14.774 --> 01:16.742
What the hell is this?

01:18.311 --> 01:19.972
lt's organic.

01:20.046 --> 01:23.812
Some kind of biopolymer residue.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.874
l want to see what's ahead.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.436 --> 01:45.904
The readings are higher
over here,

01:45.972 --> 01:48.702
but l still can't find
the source of the...

01:51.578 --> 01:52.977
Commander?

01:58.852 --> 02:01.980
Class-5 humanoid.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.649
lt appears to be dead.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.759
Captain, there are
18 bodies here--

04:30.837 --> 04:33.067
all humanoid--
1 1 male, seven female.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.436
From what we can tell,

04:34.507 --> 04:36.372
they're in various stages
of decomposition.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.603
Some have been here for years.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.839
Others, no longer
than a few days.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.746
ln fact, one body arrived
less than 12 hours ago.

04:43.816 --> 04:44.976
Arrived from where?

04:45.051 --> 04:46.177
l don't know, Captain,

04:46.252 --> 04:47.879
but from the position
of the arms

04:47.954 --> 04:50.149
l'd say we're looking
at some kind of burial site.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.487
What about the element
we discovered?

04:52.558 --> 04:55.118
lt's emanating
from their bodies, Captain.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.355
We think it's
some kind of byproduct

04:57.430 --> 04:59.591
of their decomposition process.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.499
l recommend we leave these
bodies in peace, Captain.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.036
However, Mr. Kim
has a different opinion.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.594
With all due respect, Captain,

05:06.673 --> 05:08.641
l have to disagree
with the Commander.

05:08.708 --> 05:11.302
This is our first contact
with this race,

05:11.377 --> 05:14.005
and l think we should be
learning all we can about them.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.412
lt's a unique
anthropological opportunity.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.642
l understand the chance

05:17.717 --> 05:19.241
for scientific discovery,
Captain,

05:19.319 --> 05:22.220
but whatever belief this race
has, they clearly meant

05:22.288 --> 05:23.414
for their dead to be left alone,

05:23.489 --> 05:24.922
and l think we should
respect that.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.016
l'm afraid
l agree with Commander Chakotay.

05:27.093 --> 05:29.425
Set your tricorders
for passive scans.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.622
l don't want
to disturb anything.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.131
Captain, the sanctity

05:33.199 --> 05:35.531
of these bodies
should be respected.

05:35.601 --> 05:38.069
l recommend we make
visual observations only.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.365
No tricorders.

05:39.439 --> 05:40.929
Very well.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.507
Keep me informed.

05:42.575 --> 05:43.735
Janeway out.

05:43.810 --> 05:44.970
All right.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.376
The only sensors you
have left are your eyes.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.539
Concentrate on details.

05:48.614 --> 05:49.979
We're going to have
to do a thorough report

05:50.083 --> 05:53.280
when we get back.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.289
Commander, thanks for letting me
voice my opinion to the Captain.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.121
l remember the first time
l went on a tomb excavation

06:00.193 --> 06:01.888
on Ktaria Vll.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.156
l wanted to keep a memento
of the experience,

06:04.230 --> 06:06.255
so l picked up a rock
from the burial site.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.392
Only l found out later
it wasn't just a rock.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.232
What was it?

06:11.304 --> 06:13.067
lt was a sacred stone.

06:13.139 --> 06:16.108
The Ktarians lay thousands
of them in the Tomb.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.473
Each one represents
a special prayer.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.011
Without realizing it,

06:20.079 --> 06:22.274
l had desecrated
that man's grave.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.114
Well...

06:26.185 --> 06:28.517
l think l've found out
about all l can with my eyes.

06:28.588 --> 06:29.612
Really?

06:29.689 --> 06:32.249
What have you learned
about this culture so far?

06:32.325 --> 06:36.659
They like to bury their dead
on asteroids.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.630
That's about all l can tell
without a tricorder.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.257
No artifacts, no inscriptions,

06:41.334 --> 06:42.767
just some naked dead people.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.235
You're looking,
but you're not seeing.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.601
The fact that they're
naked says a lot.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.139
lt means this race
doesn't believe

06:48.207 --> 06:49.401
in dressing the deceased.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.807
And the lack of artifacts
could indicate

06:51.878 --> 06:53.311
they don't believe
any worldly goods

06:53.379 --> 06:55.779
can be taken into the afterlife.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.975
What makes you think
they believe

06:58.084 --> 06:59.642
in an afterlife at all?

06:59.719 --> 07:02.552
Look at the position
of the arms and hands.

07:02.655 --> 07:06.022
The bodies have been arranged
in poses of serenity,

07:06.058 --> 07:08.219
and they appear to be wrapped
in the same biopolymer residue

07:08.294 --> 07:09.989
we found out in the passageway--

07:10.062 --> 07:11.689
all indications
that this culture

07:11.764 --> 07:13.095
has a great deal of ritual

07:13.166 --> 07:15.430
associated
with disposing of the dead.

07:15.501 --> 07:18.470
That normally indicates
some belief in the afterlife.

07:18.538 --> 07:20.699
The Klingons believe
in an afterlife,

07:20.773 --> 07:22.536
but there's no burial ritual.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.473
They just dispose of the corpse

07:24.544 --> 07:25.909
by the most efficient
means possible.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.536
Good point.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.639
However, some archeological digs
on the Klingon Homeworld...

07:35.488 --> 07:37.456
Tricorders.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.424
A dimensional distortion
is forming.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.518
Some kind of subspace vacuole.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.688
Chakotay to Voyager.
Emergency beam-out.

07:44.764 --> 07:48.131
We're having trouble
locking on to your signals.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.168
Stand by.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.566
Have everyone stand
closer together.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.331
l'm going to try
a blind beam-out

07:52.405 --> 07:53.497
centered on your com signal.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.666
Acknowledged. Energize!

07:59.245 --> 08:01.975
Bridge to Transporter Room 3.
Do you have them?

08:02.048 --> 08:04.744
Subspace distortions
from the vacuole are interfering

08:04.817 --> 08:05.749
with the transporter lock.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.719
l'm attempting to compensate.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.653
Okay. l think l've got them.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.594
Chakotay and Lieutenant
Torres are aboard.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.494
So is one
of the humanoid bodies,

08:19.565 --> 08:21.863
but there's no sign
of Ensign Kim.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.198
Scan the asteroid.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.238
No life signs, Captain.

08:26.305 --> 08:28.000
l'm broadening the scan.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.507
Nothing.

08:29.575 --> 08:32.339
He is nowhere in the
entire asteroid field.

08:32.410 --> 08:35.744
Seska, initiate Emergency
Transport Procedure 21 Alpha.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.181
l'm already on it, Captain.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.183
lt's no use.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.582
His pattern's gone

08:40.653 --> 08:43.679
and the subspace vacuole
has disappeared.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.417
l'm looking
at the transporter logs.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.254
My only guess is he was
pulled into the vacuole.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.556
This isn't one of the bodies
we found in the cavern.

08:49.629 --> 08:50.561
lt's someone else.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.928
This body might have come out
of the vacuole

08:53.032 --> 08:54.693
at the same time
Kim was taken in.

08:54.767 --> 08:55.825
Wait a minute.

08:55.902 --> 08:59.338
l'm showing signs of electrical
activity in the brain.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.270
lt looks like she died
just a few minutes ago.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.535
We might be able to revive her.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.373
lf we can, we might
get some answers.

09:06.445 --> 09:07.605
We can't interfere

09:07.680 --> 09:11.616
with this woman's
natural process of death.

09:11.684 --> 09:14.016
What do you suggest we do,
Commander?

09:14.086 --> 09:15.485
Kim's gone.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.715
She's the only one
who might be able

09:16.789 --> 09:18.620
to tell us what happened.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.227
Beam us directly to Sick Bay.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.819
Aye, Commander.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.728
Death is the end of this life,

09:26.799 --> 09:30.633
but it is also the beginning
of a new journey.

09:30.703 --> 09:35.037
Ptera will now thrive
in the Next Emanation.

09:35.107 --> 09:39.168
This is both her sacred duty
and her great privilege.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.406
Eler'atah.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.505
As she begins her transition,

09:43.583 --> 09:45.915
we promise
to carry memories of her

09:45.985 --> 09:47.976
so that when we enter the...

09:49.455 --> 09:51.923
Help! Get me out of here!

09:52.024 --> 09:54.049
She's... alive!

09:54.126 --> 09:55.855
Deactivate the cenotaph--

09:55.928 --> 09:57.828
quickly!

09:57.897 --> 09:59.091
Let me out...!

10:07.740 --> 10:09.571
Here it is.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.735
Thanks.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.806
A lot of memories in this.

10:16.882 --> 10:19.851
We're so proud of you, Hatil.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.444
This is such a generous,
selfless act.

10:22.521 --> 10:26.958
lt's my last gift for you
and the children.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.085
And it's one we will
always cherish.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.124
But l'm still going to miss you.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.998
l know.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.037
l'll miss you, too.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.238
But l'll see you
in the Next Emanation,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.471
when you're ready to join me.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.941
Give my love to your father.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.315
Tell him that the
garili trees he planted

10:53.386 --> 10:56.947
have, have been in bloom
for three years straight.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.854
l will.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.130
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

11:26.819 --> 11:27.979
Lie down.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.988
lt's going to be all right.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.024
We won't harm you.

11:34.393 --> 11:35.917
Who is that?

11:36.095 --> 11:38.120
We're not sure yet.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.166
We think he came
from the Next Emanation.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.963
The Next Emanation?

11:45.738 --> 11:47.899
You mean he's come back?

11:47.973 --> 11:49.440
Come back from where?

11:49.508 --> 11:51.635
We've called
for the thanatologist.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.178
He'll be here any moment.

11:53.245 --> 11:54.473
l don't think there should be

11:54.547 --> 11:56.845
any further discussion
about this until he arrives.

12:08.627 --> 12:10.561
How did you get here?

12:12.832 --> 12:14.561
l'm not sure.

12:16.769 --> 12:21.331
l just sort of woke up
inside one of those pods.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.898
l was conducting
an investigation

12:23.976 --> 12:25.443
on an asteroid.

12:25.511 --> 12:26.944
We found some dead bodies.

12:27.012 --> 12:30.573
Then there was some kind
of subspace phenomenon.

12:30.649 --> 12:33.584
What do you mean
you saw dead people there?

12:42.728 --> 12:45.697
l'm, uh, Dr. Neria,

12:45.765 --> 12:49.565
the Chief Thanatologist
of this facility.

12:49.635 --> 12:52.900
Ensign Harry Kim of
the Federation Starship Voyager.

12:52.972 --> 12:56.305
l see.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.867
What race are you from?

12:59.945 --> 13:02.175
We call ourselves human.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.909
We come from a planet
called Earth

13:04.950 --> 13:07.214
in a distant part of the galaxy.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.517
He said he saw dead
people on an asteroid.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.420
Dead?

13:12.491 --> 13:15.119
Look,
can you tell me where l am?

13:15.194 --> 13:18.186
Doctor, what does this mean?

13:18.264 --> 13:20.528
Rest, Hatil.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.931
There's no need for concern.

13:28.941 --> 13:32.604
May l speak to you
privately, Ensign Harry?

13:32.678 --> 13:35.374
Just Harry's fine.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.210
We are the Vhnori

13:37.283 --> 13:40.275
and this is our homeworld.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.912
We were investigating
one of the asteroids

13:42.988 --> 13:45.149
in the rings around your planet.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.886
There are no rings
around our world.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.786
So... the subspace vacuole

13:51.864 --> 13:54.560
must have transported me
somewhere else.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.727
Do you have any star charts
l could look at?

13:57.803 --> 14:00.237
l'd like to figure
out where l am now

14:00.306 --> 14:02.467
in relation to where l was.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.634
Where you are now

14:04.710 --> 14:07.008
is in the world of the living.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.138
Where you came from was...

14:10.649 --> 14:12.879
another dimension.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.249
Another dimension?

14:14.320 --> 14:15.287
Yes.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.915
You returned
from the Next Emanation.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.653
The afterlife.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.197
How were you able to revive her?

14:30.269 --> 14:32.703
lt's a simple process,
really.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.636
She died of a cancerous growth
on the brain stem.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.870
l removed the tumor,
replicated new neural tissue,

14:37.943 --> 14:40.639
and used the standard
Starfleet postmortem

14:40.713 --> 14:42.374
resuscitation technique
for a Class-5 life-form.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.973
Why was she covered
with this bio-polymer?

14:45.084 --> 14:47.177
She wasn't covered
with it exactly.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.245
The bio-polymer is a byproduct
of her own tissues.

14:50.322 --> 14:51.254
Explain.

14:51.323 --> 14:52.654
As her tissues decayed,

14:52.725 --> 14:56.183
the cell membranes broke down
into a bio-polymer resin,

14:56.262 --> 14:58.856
which was then excreted
by her epidermal layer.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.798
My guess is it's
a natural decomposition process

15:01.867 --> 15:03.801
for this species.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.303
So the other bio-polymer fibers
we found in the cavern were...

15:06.372 --> 15:07.304
Were probably the result

15:07.373 --> 15:09.432
of other bodies
that had decomposed

15:09.508 --> 15:12.102
and left a residual membrane.

15:12.177 --> 15:13.337
ln essence, Commander,

15:13.412 --> 15:15.642
you were strolling
through dead bodies.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.914
Can you wake her?

15:21.020 --> 15:22.510
Yes, of course.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.318
Kes, 2cc's of netinaline.

15:37.803 --> 15:38.929
Hello.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.771
l know this must be

15:41.840 --> 15:44.365
very confusing for you,
but you're all right.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.173
My name is Kathryn Janeway.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.942
l'm Ptera.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.142
Where's my brother?

15:52.217 --> 15:53.514
Your brother?

15:53.585 --> 15:55.610
l'm afraid he's not here.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.282
But he's supposed to be here.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.723
They're all supposed to be here.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.387
Ptera, we were able
to remove the tumor

16:03.462 --> 16:04.429
from your brain.

16:04.496 --> 16:05.963
You're going to be all right.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.464
We revived you
because one of our...

16:07.533 --> 16:09.398
This is the Next Emanation?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.436
This is the afterlife?

16:14.239 --> 16:16.707
No. No, it's not.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.242
You're on a starship.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.800
This can't be right.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.243
My brother's supposed
to be here.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.245
Something's wrong.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.111
-Let me explain.
-No.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.481
No, get away from me.

16:26.552 --> 16:27.519
This isn't right!

16:27.586 --> 16:28.553
This can't be right!

16:40.599 --> 16:42.430
You're saying there
was a woman in here

16:42.501 --> 16:43.525
just before l arrived?

16:43.602 --> 16:44.591
That's right.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.728
Her name was Ptera.

16:45.804 --> 16:49.501
She was dying of a tumorous
lesion to her midbrain.

16:49.575 --> 16:50.974
Dying?

16:51.076 --> 16:52.839
So she wasn't dead yet?

16:52.911 --> 16:54.503
No, of course not.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.481
She didn't die until
the cenotaph was activated.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.744
That's the purpose
of the cenotaph--

16:59.818 --> 17:01.547
it terminates a person's life

17:01.653 --> 17:04.713
just before the appearance
of a spectral rupture,

17:04.757 --> 17:06.622
and then it allows their body

17:06.692 --> 17:08.955
to be taken
to the Next Emanation.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.619
Spectral rupture.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.290
Well... l can show you.

17:17.136 --> 17:20.127
This looks like what we would
call a subspace vacuole.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.638
Does the cenotaph
create these ruptures?

17:22.708 --> 17:24.800
No. They're
natural occurrences--

17:24.877 --> 17:25.844
once every six hours.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.674
This entire complex
was built on this site

17:27.746 --> 17:29.441
because a spectral rupture
occurs here.

17:29.515 --> 17:32.541
We have thousands
of such sites on our world.

17:32.618 --> 17:37.487
Forgive my curiosity,
Harry, but, uh,

17:37.556 --> 17:39.353
you are the first person

17:39.425 --> 17:43.293
ever to come back
from the afterlife.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.660
l have quite a few questions.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.929
You said
that you saw dead bodies?

17:50.002 --> 17:51.469
That's right.

17:51.537 --> 17:56.497
There were...
seven females, 1 1 males.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.304
Some of the bodies
had been there for years.

17:58.377 --> 17:59.969
Others just for a few days.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.071
Are you saying that when we die,

18:02.114 --> 18:06.778
we go to some asteroid
and decompose?

18:07.820 --> 18:09.310
Well...

18:09.388 --> 18:11.083
that's what
it looked like to us.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.522
These bodies,
did you perform

18:13.592 --> 18:15.492
any kind of bio-scans on them?

18:15.561 --> 18:17.085
W-Was there any specific

18:17.162 --> 18:19.062
medical data
that you can remember?

18:19.131 --> 18:21.861
Doctor, maybe l should
just stop right there.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.301
This is what my people call
a First Contact situation,

18:25.370 --> 18:27.770
and we've learned
to be very careful

18:27.840 --> 18:31.401
about how much we tell
alien cultures we've just met.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.775
l would like to start
a complete bioanalysis

18:33.846 --> 18:34.972
as soon as possible.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.173
lf you'll just follow
Dr. Ranora.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.910
lf you'll just follow
Dr. Ranora.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.417
Bioanalysis?

18:40.486 --> 18:43.819
Look, all l want to do
is get back to my ship

18:43.889 --> 18:46.687
and l think there might be a way
to use this spectral

18:46.758 --> 18:47.690
rupture of yours to...

18:47.759 --> 18:49.750
You're not going anywhere.

18:49.828 --> 18:55.926
You are our first glimpse
into what lies beyond death.

18:56.034 --> 19:00.164
We are not going to let
this opportunity pass us by.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.743
We've completed our analysis
of the ring system.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.473
Our sensors have detected
over 200,000 alien bodies

19:08.547 --> 19:10.310
on various asteroids
in the rings.

19:10.382 --> 19:11.440
From what we can tell,

19:11.517 --> 19:14.111
a subspace vacuole appears
about every two hours,

19:14.186 --> 19:16.279
deposits a body,
and then disappears.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.152
We need to focus
on those vacuoles.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.020
Concentrate on trying
to probe them

19:20.092 --> 19:22.060
with a high-resolution
subspace scan.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.458
See if you can find
any sign of Mr. Kim.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.292
Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.

19:25.364 --> 19:26.296
Go ahead.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.196
Our guest
has regained consciousness

19:28.267 --> 19:29.791
and she's a little calmer
this time.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.927
l'm on my way.
You have the Bridge.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.031
That's, that's all l know.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.633
l'm sorry. l can't
tell you anything more.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.678
You've told me quite a bit.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.839
At least now l have an idea

19:42.915 --> 19:45.679
of what might
have happened to Mr. Kim.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.151
ls there anything
l can do for you?

19:48.220 --> 19:50.916
Well, l'd, l'd like
some answers.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.581
About what?

19:52.658 --> 19:55.058
About what happens
to my people when we die.

19:57.062 --> 20:00.361
We're not sure, exactly,

20:00.432 --> 20:04.869
but from what we do know,
the vacuoles deposit the bodies

20:04.937 --> 20:07.269
on the asteroids
in this ring system.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.772
And then what?

20:08.840 --> 20:10.205
l'm not sure what you mean.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.936
We're supposed to evolve

20:12.010 --> 20:15.173
into a higher level
of consciousness when we die.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.179
We're supposed to gain

20:16.248 --> 20:18.079
a greater understanding
of the universe.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.677
All of our questions
are supposed to be answered.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.688
Ptera, l know this
must be frightening for you.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.951
You've been through
a very traumatic experience--

20:27.025 --> 20:29.425
it would frighten me--

20:29.494 --> 20:31.860
but please try to understand,

20:31.930 --> 20:35.422
just because l don't have
the answers to your questions

20:35.500 --> 20:36.797
doesn't mean there aren't any.

20:39.504 --> 20:42.234
My brother...

20:42.307 --> 20:45.037
l always thought
l'd see him again.

20:45.110 --> 20:51.049
l had so many things to tell him
about his children...

20:51.116 --> 20:53.107
the people he left behind...

20:54.786 --> 20:57.311
but he isn't here, is he?

20:57.389 --> 20:59.857
He's...

21:01.193 --> 21:05.095
So, what am l supposed
to do now,

21:05.163 --> 21:08.724
spend the rest of my life
on this... this... starship?

21:08.800 --> 21:13.237
Ptera, l am going to do
everything in my power

21:13.305 --> 21:15.830
to figure out
just how you got here,

21:15.907 --> 21:19.468
and as soon as l know anything,
l will tell you.

21:19.544 --> 21:22.240
All right?

21:22.314 --> 21:23.747
All right.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.942
Maybe we should
get out of Sick Bay.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.282
Let you walk around
for a while, clear your mind.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.218
Maybe get something to eat.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.551
Are you hungry?

21:31.623 --> 21:34.888
Yes. Actually, l could use
something to eat.

21:35.894 --> 21:36.861
What was that?!

21:36.928 --> 21:38.395
Janeway to Bridge.
Report.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.294
There's some kind
of dimensional distortion

21:40.365 --> 21:42.162
forming near Main Engineering,
Captain.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.361
lt looks like
a subspace vacuole.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.529
Janeway to Engineering.
B'Elanna, what's going on?

21:46.605 --> 21:49.199
l've pinpointed the location,
Captain.

21:49.274 --> 21:51.367
lt's right here in Engineering.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.104
Stand by.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.054
Hatil, what are you saying?

22:07.025 --> 22:10.927
l'm just not sure l'm ready,
that's all.

22:11.029 --> 22:13.827
l don't understand.

22:13.899 --> 22:16.697
Neither do l.

22:16.768 --> 22:19.896
lt's just
that l'm starting to wonder

22:19.971 --> 22:23.668
what really happens
when we die...

22:23.742 --> 22:25.642
if l'm really going on

22:25.711 --> 22:29.704
to a higher level
of consciousness.

22:29.781 --> 22:32.807
The alien, what has
he been telling you?

22:32.884 --> 22:35.876
All he's done is made
me stop and think

22:35.954 --> 22:38.388
about something we've
always taken for granted.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.826
And now that l've
thought about it,

22:42.894 --> 22:45.761
l'm not so eager to go
through with it anymore.

22:45.831 --> 22:48.732
Hatil, we know
nothing about him,

22:48.800 --> 22:52.600
or why he's come here,
or why he's spreading lies

22:52.671 --> 22:54.002
about the Next Emanation.

22:54.139 --> 22:56.573
All l know is
you can't throw away

22:56.641 --> 22:58.939
a lifetime of belief
because of him.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.875
lt doesn't make any sense.

23:02.681 --> 23:05.707
l don't know
what to think anymore.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.084
l'm scared, Araya.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.489
lt's going to be all right.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.356
Think about your father.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.157
He's waiting for you.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.467
l'll see you
at the Transference Ritual.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.709
l don't know who you are,
or where you come from,

23:35.781 --> 23:38.079
but you stay away
from my husband.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.243
l'm sorry.

23:40.318 --> 23:41.979
l didn't mean to...

23:44.589 --> 23:48.116
Harry,
you have to forgive my wife.

23:48.193 --> 23:52.095
She's having trouble
understanding my concerns

23:52.164 --> 23:53.961
about the afterlife.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.829
That's why l'm here.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.370
l'm, uh...

23:59.438 --> 24:01.201
getting ready to die.

24:01.306 --> 24:06.710
Forgive me for asking again,
but can you tell me anything

24:06.745 --> 24:09.805
about what l might find
in the Next Emanation?

24:09.881 --> 24:11.815
Everyone keeps asking me that,

24:11.883 --> 24:14.681
and l just keep giving
the same answer.

24:14.753 --> 24:15.913
l don't know.

24:16.021 --> 24:20.117
But you do come
from the afterlife.

24:20.192 --> 24:23.650
l come from a different reality,
maybe another dimension,

24:23.728 --> 24:26.162
and maybe it is your afterlife.

24:26.231 --> 24:27.698
l don't know.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.860
All l do know is that there
are countless billions

24:30.936 --> 24:33.496
of people there
who are born, live and die

24:33.572 --> 24:34.539
just like you do here.

24:34.606 --> 24:38.372
But you did see my people there.

24:38.443 --> 24:40.240
You said they were dead.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.577
Yes, but...

24:43.648 --> 24:47.414
Look, for all l know,
your thanatologists are right,

24:47.486 --> 24:48.748
and all l saw were

24:48.820 --> 24:50.913
the corporeal remains
of your people,

24:50.989 --> 24:53.890
and you do go on
to a higher consciousness.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.620
But it's, uh...

24:55.694 --> 24:59.653
it's also possible that...

24:59.731 --> 25:02.757
there is no higher
existence for us--

25:02.868 --> 25:07.896
that when we die,
we simply cease to exist.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.600
l...

25:10.675 --> 25:13.235
l really can't say.

25:13.311 --> 25:16.906
l don't know what happens
to your people after they die.

25:16.982 --> 25:20.008
l don't even know what happens
to my people after they die.

25:20.085 --> 25:24.647
Don't you have thanatologists,
people who study death?

25:24.723 --> 25:26.918
Well, sort of.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.586
There have certainly been
medical experts,

25:30.662 --> 25:32.653
philosophers, theologians,

25:32.731 --> 25:35.700
who have spent
a great deal of time

25:35.767 --> 25:37.860
debating what happens
after death,

25:37.936 --> 25:40.496
but no one's come up
with an answer yet.

25:40.572 --> 25:43.803
My people have come
to think of death

25:43.875 --> 25:47.311
as just another stage
of our existence.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.315
There are some people
who are even eager to die.

25:51.483 --> 25:55.476
lf they feel depressed
or lonely in this life,

25:55.554 --> 25:57.886
they simply move on
to the next one.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.389
ls that why you're here?

25:59.457 --> 26:01.823
Because you're not happy
with your life?

26:05.897 --> 26:08.388
Ever since the, um...

26:08.466 --> 26:09.831
accident...

26:12.404 --> 26:15.567
life hasn't been easy.

26:17.108 --> 26:20.600
But l have to say this
is more my family's idea

26:20.679 --> 26:22.010
than it is mine.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.047
Your family.

26:23.114 --> 26:26.447
l'm a burden to them right now.

26:26.518 --> 26:30.511
lt takes a lot of their time
and resources to care for me,

26:30.589 --> 26:33.888
and l can't give
much back to them.

26:33.959 --> 26:38.362
So there was a family meeting,
and it was agreed that...

26:38.430 --> 26:41.558
l should move on
to the Next Emanation.

26:46.571 --> 26:48.198
You look appalled.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.867
lt's not my place
to judge your culture,

26:50.942 --> 26:52.807
but from my perspective,

26:52.877 --> 26:55.437
it's a little chilling
to hear that.

26:57.349 --> 27:01.547
Even though the family
did it out of... love...

27:03.021 --> 27:09.358
and everyone was happy for me,
and they said they'd see me

27:09.427 --> 27:11.918
when they got
to the Next Emanation...

27:13.798 --> 27:16.130
l have to admit,

27:16.201 --> 27:17.566
there is a little voice
inside of me

27:17.636 --> 27:20.366
that is terrified of dying

27:20.438 --> 27:22.235
and since
l've been talking to you...

27:23.775 --> 27:26.073
that little voice
has started to get...

27:26.144 --> 27:28.009
louder.

27:37.522 --> 27:39.717
l'm reading another vacuole
forming on the ship.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.725
Tuvok, try remodulating
the shield harmonics.

27:41.793 --> 27:42.885
lt's no use, Captain.

27:42.961 --> 27:45.725
The vacuole is still forming.

27:53.471 --> 27:55.268
Take the body
to the ship's morgue.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.409
This is odd.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.640
Three bodies have appeared

28:03.715 --> 28:05.842
on Voyager so far,
and each one of them

28:05.917 --> 28:08.943
has released some kind
of neural energy.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.578
ln every case,
the energy has passed

28:10.655 --> 28:14.751
through the hull
and out into the rings.

28:14.826 --> 28:17.192
The energy's frequency
is identical

28:17.262 --> 28:20.095
to the ambient radiation
in the asteroid field.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.664
The vacuoles are disrupting

28:23.735 --> 28:25.464
the warp core's
magnetic interlocks.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.869
lt won't be long before
we lose antimatter containment.

28:27.972 --> 28:29.098
The vacuoles have all formed

28:29.174 --> 28:31.404
within 20 meters
of the warp core.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.444
They might be attracted to it.

28:33.511 --> 28:34.910
Janeway to Bridge.

28:35.013 --> 28:36.310
Mr. Paris, lay in a course.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.439
l want to get at least

28:37.515 --> 28:39.847
a half a light year away.
Warp seven.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.351
Aye, Captain.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.826
Paris to Janeway.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.828
l've brought us out of warp.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.694
We're point six light-years
from the ring system.

28:54.766 --> 28:57.394
Any other subspace
vacuoles forming?

28:57.469 --> 28:58.731
No.

28:58.803 --> 29:00.202
The magnetic interlocks
have stabilized.

29:00.305 --> 29:01.329
l think we're safe out here.

29:01.372 --> 29:03.306
Begin working
on a way to protect

29:03.374 --> 29:04.432
the warp core
from these vacuoles.

29:04.509 --> 29:05.567
Aye, Captain.

29:10.949 --> 29:14.715
Sometimes l come in here and
just stare out at the stars.

29:14.786 --> 29:15.810
for hours.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.856
l never get tired
of looking at them.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.824
We were always told we
would see beautiful sights

29:21.893 --> 29:25.454
in the Next Emanation--
colors, lights--

29:25.530 --> 29:27.589
and that we would see
them with new eyes

29:27.665 --> 29:28.791
and a new understanding.

29:28.867 --> 29:32.394
But now...

29:32.470 --> 29:35.633
what happened to the others--

29:35.707 --> 29:38.107
my brother...

29:38.176 --> 29:39.643
my father...

29:39.711 --> 29:43.579
and everyone before them.

29:43.648 --> 29:47.084
People die every day
on my world.

29:47.152 --> 29:50.246
Do they all end up
as lifeless corpses?

29:50.321 --> 29:54.382
When people die on my world,
we bury them beneath the soil

29:54.459 --> 29:58.691
and we believe that their comra
is released into the afterlife.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.890
Their comra?

30:00.965 --> 30:02.899
Our soul, our spirit,

30:02.967 --> 30:05.094
the essence of our beings.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.604
Maybe something similar
happens to you.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.109
But you don't understand.

30:12.177 --> 30:15.613
We don't believe
in any kind of spirit.

30:15.680 --> 30:19.639
When we die, we're supposed
to reappear as physical beings

30:19.717 --> 30:21.651
with arms and legs.

30:21.719 --> 30:23.346
That's the whole point

30:23.421 --> 30:26.754
of sending our people
through the spectral ruptures.

30:26.825 --> 30:31.319
We're supposed to travel on to
the Next Emanation as ourselves,

30:31.396 --> 30:33.796
and be reunited
with our families.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.402
But none of that is true...

30:40.471 --> 30:41.995
is it?

30:47.078 --> 30:50.047
None of the people l love
are here.

30:51.649 --> 30:53.207
l'm alone.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.020
l don't belong here.

30:59.090 --> 31:01.320
l can't live like this.

31:01.426 --> 31:04.486
Please, can't you send me home?

31:04.529 --> 31:07.464
l think there is
only one person on this ship

31:07.532 --> 31:10.160
who could answer that question.

31:10.235 --> 31:13.568
We're doing everything we can
to get you back home, Ptera.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.833
Once we locate
our missing officer,

31:15.907 --> 31:17.875
we're hoping he might be able
to tell us enough to...

31:17.942 --> 31:18.874
Wait a minute, Captain.

31:18.943 --> 31:21.411
Maybe there is a way
to send Ptera home

31:21.479 --> 31:23.879
and find Ensign Kim
at the same time.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.347
Explain.

31:25.416 --> 31:27.941
What if we recreated
the transporter accident?

31:28.019 --> 31:29.782
lf it's true that Harry was
pulled through the vacuole

31:29.854 --> 31:31.287
during transport,
we might be able

31:31.356 --> 31:33.381
to reproduce
those circumstances,

31:33.458 --> 31:34.720
and send Ptera home.

31:34.792 --> 31:37.522
We could send Ptera through
with a subspace transponder,

31:37.595 --> 31:38.823
and hope the signal
will penetrate

31:38.897 --> 31:39.829
the dimensional barrier,

31:39.898 --> 31:41.661
and allow us
to lock on to Kim

31:41.733 --> 31:42.665
with a transporter beam.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.666
Right.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.929
So l can get home?

31:46.104 --> 31:48.129
Ptera, you should know

31:48.206 --> 31:50.333
that there's no guarantee
this is going to work.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.966
l understand the risk,

31:52.043 --> 31:54.011
but l've already
been dead once,

31:54.112 --> 31:57.047
and l'm prepared to die again
if necessary.

31:57.115 --> 31:59.982
So if there's a chance
l can get home,

32:00.051 --> 32:01.643
l'm willing to take the risk.

32:01.686 --> 32:04.382
All right.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.356
Commander, prepare
a subspace transponder

32:06.424 --> 32:07.823
and teach Ptera how to use it.

32:07.892 --> 32:09.018
Aye, Captain.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.530
Captain's Log, supplemental.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.691
We've returned
to the ring system,

32:15.767 --> 32:18.861
and we're preparing to send
Ptera back to her dimension.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.564
Lieutenant Torres
has found a way

32:20.638 --> 32:23.106
to temporarily protect the
warp core against the vacuoles,

32:23.174 --> 32:24.402
but she is uncertain

32:24.475 --> 32:28.172
how long her measures
will be effective.

32:28.246 --> 32:30.976
You understand the instructions
for Mr. Kim, if you find him?

32:31.049 --> 32:32.209
Yes.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.250
We've got one, Commander,

32:33.318 --> 32:35.616
forming ten meters
below us, Deck 13.

32:35.687 --> 32:36.949
Okay, let's see
if your dampening field

32:37.021 --> 32:39.319
is going to protect
the warp core.

32:39.390 --> 32:43.554
The field is fluctuating
slightly... but holding.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.619
Engineering
to Transporter Room 3.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.324
There's a vacuole
forming on Deck 13.

32:47.398 --> 32:49.298
Magnetic interlocks are stable.

32:49.367 --> 32:50.459
Acknowledged.

32:50.535 --> 32:52.901
l see the vacuole.
Locking on.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.508
Good luck, Ptera.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.915
l have a transporter lock.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.313
Energizing.

33:06.384 --> 33:09.876
Matching her pattern
to the subspace distortions.

33:09.954 --> 33:12.422
Wait a minute, the vacuole
is shutting down.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.856
l can't get her pattern through.

33:14.926 --> 33:16.484
Abort the procedure.
Pull her back.

33:16.561 --> 33:19.587
l'm trying.
l'm losing her pattern.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.757
Shunt emergency power
into buffer tank 4.

33:23.434 --> 33:26.164
That's it.
l've got the pattern.

33:37.815 --> 33:39.339
She's dead.

33:39.417 --> 33:40.349
ls there any brain activity?

33:40.418 --> 33:41.544
Can we revive her?

33:43.755 --> 33:44.722
Janeway to Lieutenant Torres.

33:44.789 --> 33:46.814
How long until we have to leave?

33:46.891 --> 33:48.859
l'd say we're safe
for another two hours.

33:48.926 --> 33:50.917
That gives us two hours
to find Mr. Kim.

33:50.995 --> 33:53.156
We'll have to stay within
high-range scanner range.

33:53.231 --> 33:54.562
Perform another subspace scan.

33:54.632 --> 33:56.930
This time, extend
the scan radius to ten AU.

33:57.001 --> 33:58.764
l'm on my way to Engineering.
Janeway out.

33:58.836 --> 33:59.768
Aye, Captain.

33:59.837 --> 34:02.328
Ensign, beam her onto
one of the asteroids.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.907
Aye, Captain.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.772
That's where
she was meant to be.

34:11.748 --> 34:14.809
l hope you find
your afterlife, Ptera.

34:18.489 --> 34:19.614
Why?

34:19.690 --> 34:21.920
We want to make
a more detailed scan

34:21.993 --> 34:23.483
of your
microcellular structures,

34:23.561 --> 34:25.927
and a complete examination
of your neural chemistry.

34:26.030 --> 34:29.431
This facility isn't equipped
for such a detailed bioanalysis.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.867
The complex at Paffran
has everything we need.

34:32.937 --> 34:35.906
Look, if my ship
is still searching for me,

34:35.973 --> 34:37.873
they're not going
to stay there forever.

34:37.942 --> 34:39.034
l have to get back.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.407
That's not possible.

34:40.478 --> 34:43.344
We don't even understand
how you got here.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.348
Then maybe l can figure out
a way to get back.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.315
Let me take a look
at one of those cenotaphs.

34:47.385 --> 34:48.851
There's no time for that.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.286
Word about you has spread
very quickly, Harry.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.380
Not only in the scientific
world, but in the community

34:53.458 --> 34:54.389
at large.

34:54.458 --> 34:58.395
There are many people
who are very... nervous

34:58.463 --> 34:59.987
about what you represent.

35:00.031 --> 35:01.328
Some even see you as a threat

35:01.365 --> 35:03.094
to their beliefs
about the afterlife.

35:03.167 --> 35:07.001
We need to take you
to a more secure location.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.505
lt's for your own protection.

35:09.574 --> 35:11.235
Wait!

35:11.309 --> 35:13.777
l'm sorry, Harry.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.813
lt's out of my control.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.152
What are you doing?

35:27.225 --> 35:30.058
Preparing for
the Transference Ritual.

35:32.096 --> 35:34.860
This is a ceremonial shroud

35:34.932 --> 35:39.130
that's been in my family
for five generations.

35:39.203 --> 35:44.641
So they make you wrap yourself
in your own death shroud.

35:44.709 --> 35:48.509
lt's something we look
forward to, actually.

35:48.579 --> 35:51.980
l remember
when my father used this shroud,

35:52.083 --> 35:55.985
and his father before him.

35:56.087 --> 35:59.989
The difference is,
when my father put this on,

36:00.024 --> 36:05.360
there was no doubt in his mind
about where he was going.

36:05.429 --> 36:07.363
Can't you just back out?

36:07.431 --> 36:09.399
Say you've changed your mind?

36:09.467 --> 36:16.236
l... have thought of just
walking out and disappearing.

36:16.307 --> 36:19.276
l have some friends
in the Cararian Mountains.

36:19.343 --> 36:23.109
They would be willing
to let me stay with them.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.116
But my family
would worry about me.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.119
They'd wonder
what was happening,

36:29.187 --> 36:35.683
if l was all right,
if l were hurt...

36:35.760 --> 36:39.287
No. Everyone's expecting
a Transference Ritual

36:39.363 --> 36:41.763
and l'm going to give them one.

36:41.832 --> 36:46.235
What if you did disappear
into the mountains,

36:46.304 --> 36:49.273
but your family
thought you were dead?

36:49.340 --> 36:52.434
l mean, they're here for
a Transference Ritual, right?

36:52.510 --> 36:56.503
Do you realize
what you're suggesting?

36:56.581 --> 36:57.980
lt's perfect.

36:58.082 --> 37:01.313
Those cenotaphs send your people
back to my dimension,

37:01.419 --> 37:03.512
which is where l want to go.

37:03.554 --> 37:07.650
Voyager's probably still near
the asteroid searching for me.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.488
As soon as l appear,

37:09.560 --> 37:12.586
they'll pick up my signal
and beam me aboard.

37:12.663 --> 37:14.096
And you...

37:14.165 --> 37:16.599
you can just disappear.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.101
Your family will
think you're dead,

37:19.170 --> 37:23.698
and you can live out your life
in the mountains.

37:23.774 --> 37:27.870
Harry, if you go
into that cenotaph

37:27.979 --> 37:29.913
and go through
with the Transference Ritual,

37:30.014 --> 37:31.538
you'll die.

37:31.616 --> 37:35.074
Well, if Voyager can
beam me aboard quickly enough,

37:35.152 --> 37:37.882
our doctor should be able
to revive me.

37:39.557 --> 37:42.924
Medicine's pretty advanced
in our culture.

37:43.027 --> 37:45.222
l've heard of cases where people
have been dead for hours

37:45.296 --> 37:46.820
and still been
brought back to life.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.927
But it's not certain.

37:50.001 --> 37:54.062
No, it's not...

37:54.138 --> 37:58.097
but l think this
is my only chance to get home.

38:06.350 --> 38:09.183
The shroud has to be wrapped
in a particular way.

38:09.253 --> 38:10.948
l'll show you how.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.956
But we have to hurry.

38:13.024 --> 38:16.619
l'm scheduled for Transference
in less than an hour.

38:22.166 --> 38:24.634
A pleasant trip, Hatil.

38:24.702 --> 38:27.637
Say hello to Varel and Toyan.

38:27.705 --> 38:30.674
l'll see you there
in a few years.

38:32.743 --> 38:34.870
We are joined here today

38:34.945 --> 38:38.711
to bid farewell
to our dear friend Hatil Garan.

38:38.783 --> 38:41.308
We salute not only his life,

38:41.385 --> 38:44.650
but the manner in which
he has chosen to end it.

38:44.722 --> 38:47.657
He makes
a noble sacrifice today,

38:47.725 --> 38:51.183
that his family
may have a better tomorrow.

38:51.262 --> 38:54.197
We prepare to send him on
to the Next Emanation

38:54.265 --> 38:56.597
with the full knowledge
and faith

38:56.667 --> 39:01.001
that the life he will find there
is better than the one here,

39:01.072 --> 39:04.769
that he will no longer
be hampered by his infirmities,

39:04.842 --> 39:08.243
and that he will come
to understand the cosmos

39:08.312 --> 39:11.247
in a way that he could
never have imagined.

39:14.118 --> 39:17.417
Good-bye, Hatil.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.786
l love you.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.140
Another vacuole.
Deck 15.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.652
The body of an alien female
has been left behind.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.846
Chakotay
to Transporter Room 3.

39:50.921 --> 39:52.786
Lock on to the body on Deck 15,

39:52.857 --> 39:54.825
and transport it
to one of the asteroids.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.086
Aye, sir.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.923
Status on the warp core,
Lieutenant.

39:57.995 --> 40:00.463
The dampening field's
down to 21 percent.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.499
The interlocks won't
hold much longer.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.433
l recommend leaving, Captain.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.405
Very well.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.813
Mr. Paris, bring us about.

40:19.884 --> 40:21.818
Prepare to resume our...

40:22.853 --> 40:24.980
Captain,
l'm picking up a vacuole

40:25.055 --> 40:26.317
forming on Deck 12.

40:26.390 --> 40:28.483
lt deposited a human body...

40:28.559 --> 40:29.992
Human?

40:30.060 --> 40:31.857
But it's dead.

40:33.531 --> 40:34.498
Janeway to Seska.

40:34.565 --> 40:35.497
There's a body on Deck 12.

40:35.566 --> 40:36.999
Beam it directly to Sick Bay.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.364
Yes, Captain.

40:43.808 --> 40:46.299
2cc's cordrazine.

41:07.097 --> 41:10.191
Relax, Mr. Kim.
Everything's fine.

41:10.267 --> 41:12.258
You're alive.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.562
Mind if l join you?

41:46.637 --> 41:48.571
No, not at all.
Please.

41:48.639 --> 41:49.936
Thank you.

41:52.476 --> 41:54.967
So, how are you feeling?

41:55.045 --> 41:58.344
Better. l'll be ready
for duty tomorrow morning.

41:58.415 --> 42:00.906
You're off duty
for the next two days.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.451
Captain, l'm fine.

42:02.486 --> 42:05.546
lt's not a reflection
on your capabilities, Ensign.

42:05.623 --> 42:10.560
l just want to give you a chance
to reflect on what's happened.

42:10.628 --> 42:13.256
This may not make
much sense to you now--

42:13.330 --> 42:16.265
a young man
at the beginning of his career--

42:16.333 --> 42:18.392
but one of the things you learn
as you move up the ranks

42:18.469 --> 42:22.371
and get a little older
is that...

42:22.439 --> 42:26.432
you wish you had more time
in your youth to really...

42:26.510 --> 42:29.206
absorb all the things
that happen to you.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.908
lt goes by so fast.

42:33.450 --> 42:36.248
lt's so easy to become jaded,

42:36.320 --> 42:37.753
to treat the extraordinary

42:37.821 --> 42:40.119
like just another day
at the office.

42:40.190 --> 42:42.920
But sometimes...

42:42.993 --> 42:46.986
there are experiences
which transcend all that.

42:47.064 --> 42:48.929
You've just had one, Mr. Kim,

42:48.999 --> 42:53.231
and l want you to live
with it for a little while.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.238
Write about it
if you feel like it.

42:55.306 --> 42:57.331
Paint...

42:57.408 --> 42:59.569
express yourself
in some fashion.

42:59.643 --> 43:02.544
The Bridge will still be there
in two days.

43:02.646 --> 43:05.547
Thank you, Captain.

43:05.583 --> 43:10.919
l have been a little preoccupied
with the experience.

43:11.021 --> 43:12.852
l mean, all those people think

43:12.923 --> 43:15.357
that they know
what happens after death.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.757
They look forward to it.

43:16.827 --> 43:18.761
They're prepared for it.

43:18.829 --> 43:22.765
But the truth is,
none of it's real.

43:22.833 --> 43:25.358
They don't have an afterlife.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.371
They just decay
inside those asteroids.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.306
l wouldn't be so sure of that
if l were you.

43:31.375 --> 43:34.139
That neural energy
their bodies release--

43:34.211 --> 43:35.644
it becomes part

43:35.713 --> 43:39.547
of the ambient electromagnetic
field surrounding the planet.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.608
Our readings also indicate

43:41.685 --> 43:43.983
the energy is unusually dynamic.

43:44.088 --> 43:46.386
There's a great deal
of variation

43:46.457 --> 43:49.255
in pattern complexity,
quantum density...

43:49.326 --> 43:53.558
Are you saying you think
they do have an afterlife?

43:53.631 --> 43:56.566
That the energy field
is where they exist

43:56.634 --> 43:58.898
at a higher level
of consciousness,

43:58.969 --> 44:00.527
just like they believe?

44:02.539 --> 44:05.030
l'm not certain.

44:05.109 --> 44:08.044
But l am certain about this:

44:08.112 --> 44:12.014
What we don't know about death

44:12.082 --> 44:16.314
is far, far greater
than what we do know.

44:18.022 --> 44:20.923
See you in two days, Ensign.

44:21.025 --> 44:23.186
Thank you, Captain.
