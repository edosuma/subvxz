13:08.417 --> 13:09.875
- OKAY. OKAY, OKAY.

13:09.875 --> 13:13.250
BUT FIRST SOMEBODY REALLY
WANTS TO TALK WITH YOU.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.250
[giggling]

13:14.250 --> 13:16.625
- DEXTER!

13:16.625 --> 13:18.583
- HEY, CODY, YOU OKAY?

13:18.583 --> 13:20.291
- WE'VE BEEN HAVING
THE BEST DAY.

13:20.291 --> 13:22.959
I HAD COTTON CANDY
FOR BREAKFAST.

13:22.959 --> 13:24.917
- THAT'S GREAT.
Astor: HERE, GIVE ME THE PHONE.

13:24.917 --> 13:26.959
GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.041
HEY, DEXTER.
CAN I TALK TO MOM?

13:29.041 --> 13:31.834
- NOT NOW.
- WHY NOT?

13:31.834 --> 13:34.792
- SHE'S, UH...

13:34.792 --> 13:36.375
SHE'S IN THE SHOWER.

13:36.375 --> 13:39.208
- WELL...CAN YOU TELL HER
WE MISS HER?

13:39.208 --> 13:42.417
Cody: WE MISS YOU TOO,
DEXTER, AND HARRISON.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.750
Astor: HERE'S MY GRANDMOTHER.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.417
- [laughing]
SO THERE WAS SOMETHING

13:46.417 --> 13:48.875
THAT YOU NEEDED TO TELL ME?

13:48.875 --> 13:51.291
- WHEN YOU BRING THEM HOME
TONIGHT, UH...

13:51.291 --> 13:52.834
[Harrison fusses]

13:52.834 --> 13:57.000
COME TO DEB'S APARTMENT
INSTEAD OF THE HOUSE...OKAY?

13:57.000 --> 14:00.333
- WHAT HAPPENED,
DID YOU MISS YOUR FLIGHT?

14:00.333 --> 14:04.834
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'LL EXPLAIN WHEN YOU GET HERE.

14:10.041 --> 14:13.000
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TELL THEM ABOUT RITA?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.583
- [exhales]

14:14.583 --> 14:18.458
I JUST WANT THEM TO HAVE
ONE MORE GOOD DAY.

14:18.458 --> 14:22.000
- LOOK, I KNOW
THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT...

14:22.000 --> 14:23.917
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT NEED TO HAPPEN

14:23.917 --> 14:26.291
BEFORE RITA CAN BE BURIED.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.375
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE
ALL MORNING

14:30.375 --> 14:32.959
WITH A FUNERAL DIRECTOR
WHO DOES A LOT OF COPS.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.542
AND HE'S WILLING TO SEE US
RIGHT AWAY.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.083
YOU WILLING TO DO THAT?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.250
- I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

14:54.250 --> 14:56.208
- HOW DOES HE DO THAT?

14:56.208 --> 14:58.458
- MY SINCERE CONDOLENCES.

14:58.458 --> 15:01.083
- HE SOUNDS LIKE
HE ACTUALLY MEANS IT.

15:02.417 --> 15:05.458
- THANK YOU.

15:05.458 --> 15:08.000
- WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.333
COFFEE?

15:10.333 --> 15:11.917
WATER?

15:11.917 --> 15:14.375
- NO. I'M FINE.

15:14.375 --> 15:17.000
[Harrison fusses]

15:21.417 --> 15:23.750
- THERE ARE KLEENEXES HERE...

15:23.750 --> 15:27.125
IF YOU NEED THEM.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.208
WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW,
DEXTER--

15:32.208 --> 15:35.291
M-MAY I CALL YOU THAT?

15:35.291 --> 15:36.792
WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW,
DEXTER,

15:36.792 --> 15:38.375
IS MAKE SOME VERY
IMPORTANT DECISIONS

15:38.375 --> 15:41.917
ABOUT HOW YOUR WIFE RITA
WILL BE REMEMBERED.

15:41.917 --> 15:43.959
- OKAY.

15:43.959 --> 15:46.792
- WE LIKE TO START WITH
THE OBITUARY.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.750
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO LET PEOPLE
KNOW ABOUT SERVICES

15:48.750 --> 15:50.667
AND WHERE TO SEND
REMEMBRANCES.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.583
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT'S A CHANCE TO EXPRESS

15:52.583 --> 15:54.625
YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT RITA
IN YOUR OWN WORDS.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.625
- 'SCUSE ME.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.625
- I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING
FOR THE PAPER.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.500
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED?

16:16.625 --> 16:18.917
- SO THIS IS HOW
NORMAL PEOPLE DO IT.

16:18.917 --> 16:21.959
NO HEFTY BAGS.
NO DIESEL FUMES.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.667
- [sobbing]

16:26.667 --> 16:29.458
- THIS IS WHAT
SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED--

16:29.458 --> 16:31.792
A GRIEVING SPOUSE...

16:31.792 --> 16:35.417
FOR ONCE DOING WHAT
A PERSON'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.834
- DEXTER MORGAN?

16:54.834 --> 16:56.333
- RITA?

16:56.333 --> 16:58.917
HI.
- HI.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.500
SORRY I'M LATE.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.875
- THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.834
- THERE WAS TRAFFIC,
OF COURSE.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.834
I WENT TO THE WRONG CAFE.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.875
I WENT TO THE ONE
IN TOWN.

17:08.875 --> 17:11.625
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
ANYTHING EVEN OUT THIS FAR.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.667
HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE?

17:13.667 --> 17:16.125
- I, UH...
TRACKED IT DOWN.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.166
- SO I--YOUR SISTER...

17:24.166 --> 17:26.041
DEBRA'S TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

17:26.041 --> 17:28.041
- UH-OH.
- OH.

17:28.041 --> 17:30.083
NOTHING BAD, OF COURSE.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.166
- SHE OMITTED THE FACT
THAT I'M AN AX MURDERER?

17:32.166 --> 17:35.375
- NO. SHE SAID THAT
YOU WERE A...

17:35.375 --> 17:37.375
BLOODSTAIN PATTERN
ANALYST...

17:37.375 --> 17:39.750
WHICH I HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT THAT IS.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.625
- BELIEVE ME,
I BARELY DO EITHER,

17:41.625 --> 17:44.333
AND I DO IT 40 HOURS A WEEK.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.000
- SHE SEEMS NICE,
YOUR SISTER.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.250
- YOU SEEM NICE TOO.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.041
- THANK YOU.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.000
- [chuckles]

17:57.375 --> 17:58.709
- SO, UM, WHAT'S GOOD HERE?

17:58.709 --> 18:00.000
I MEAN,
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING SPECIAL

18:00.000 --> 18:03.500
TO BRING YOU
ALL THE WAY OUT THIS FAR.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.291
I...

18:05.291 --> 18:06.834
I USUALLY PLAY IT SAFE

18:06.834 --> 18:09.083
AND GO WITH
A CAESAR SALAD.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.792
BUT I DON'T
SEE ONE ON HERE.

18:11.792 --> 18:14.959
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'M GONNA GET THE SPECIAL,

18:14.959 --> 18:16.583
THE MUSHROOM RAVIOLI.

18:16.583 --> 18:18.083
DEXTER?

18:20.375 --> 18:21.792
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT?

18:21.792 --> 18:23.083
- YES, I DO.

18:27.291 --> 18:30.125
[woman sobbing]

18:35.125 --> 18:36.917
- DEX.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.417
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:39.417 --> 18:43.917
- I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT RITA, HOW MUCH...

18:43.917 --> 18:46.208
- HOW MUCH YOU MISS HER?

18:46.208 --> 18:49.750
- HOW MUCH I LIED TO HER,
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

18:56.625 --> 18:59.125
- FUNERAL'S
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

18:59.125 --> 19:02.959
I CHOSE AN OAK CASKET.
I HOPE THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

19:02.959 --> 19:06.583
WHITE ROSES.
I THINK SHE'D LIKE THOSE.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.959
THEY WANT TO KNOW
IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR DRESS

19:08.959 --> 19:11.709
YOU'D LIKE HER TO BE BURIED IN.

19:11.709 --> 19:14.417
- NOT REALLY.

19:14.417 --> 19:17.291
- OKAY.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.125
LL FIND SOMETHING.

19:19.125 --> 19:22.667
QUINN CALLED, AND THE FBI
HAS RELEASED THE CRIME SCENE

19:22.667 --> 19:24.375
AT YOUR HOUSE,

19:24.375 --> 19:27.333
SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I WANT TO DO THERE AND...

19:27.333 --> 19:28.917
I'M GONNA DROP YOU TWO OFF
AT THE APARTMENT.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.000
IS THAT OKAY?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.333
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.083
[woman sobbing]

19:35.083 --> 19:38.125
- YOU'RE WORRYING ME.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.166
- I REALLY DIDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO COME.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.750
- WE'RE PARTNERS.
I'M HERE.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.667
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

20:13.667 --> 20:15.083
- NOTHING.

20:15.083 --> 20:18.750
TRINITY WOULDN'T LEAVE
ANYTHING BEHIND.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.834
- WHAT ARE WE DOING THEN?

20:28.166 --> 20:31.750
- I WANTED TO CLEAN
THE PLACE UP.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.959
MAKE SURE DEXTER
DIDN'T SEE IT LIKE THIS.

20:33.959 --> 20:37.917
- THE FBI LEFT IT THIS WAY.

20:37.917 --> 20:40.500
THEY HAVE PEOPLE
WHO'LL DO THAT.

21:36.208 --> 21:39.125
- THIS MUCH BLOOD,
USUALLY YOU CALL DEXTER.

21:41.959 --> 21:44.458
HOW YOU HOLDIN' UP?

21:47.959 --> 21:50.458
- OKAY. I GUESS.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.375
I MEAN, YOU KNOW MY BROTHER.
IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TELL.

21:55.375 --> 21:58.583
- NO, I MEAN YOU.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

21:58.583 --> 22:00.291
- OH.

22:02.917 --> 22:04.333
FINE.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.750
NOT USED TO HAVING TO BE
THE STRONG ONE, YOU KNOW?

22:09.083 --> 22:11.083
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DEXTER.

22:12.709 --> 22:15.542
AND NOW...
- HE'S THE STRONG ONE?

22:15.542 --> 22:19.000
TO ME IT'S ALWAYS SEEMED
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.166
- SWEAR TO GOD,
I CAN'T EVEN...

22:24.166 --> 22:26.667
TELL WHAT HE'S THINKING.

22:26.667 --> 22:27.917
- [whispering] SORRY.

22:27.917 --> 22:30.917
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.625
[whispers]
IT'S OKAY.

22:36.041 --> 22:39.375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

22:59.333 --> 23:02.125
[knocking, kids' voices]

23:02.125 --> 23:04.875
- HURRY, COME ON, OPEN UP!
DEXTER!

23:04.875 --> 23:07.208
[knocking continues]
Maura: ARE YOU THERE?

23:07.208 --> 23:10.375
[knocking, chattering]

23:11.709 --> 23:14.000
- DEXTER,
YOU CAME BACK EARLY!

23:14.000 --> 23:15.291
OH!

23:15.291 --> 23:17.083
- HEY, GUYS.
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

23:17.083 --> 23:19.500
- IT WAS AWESOME.
- WE GOT YOU STUFF.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.125
[laughter]

23:22.125 --> 23:26.500
- PERFECT.
- THERE'S ONE FOR MOM TOO.

23:30.959 --> 23:33.125
- WHERE IS SHE?

23:33.125 --> 23:36.083
- SHE'S NOT HERE.

23:36.083 --> 23:39.000
- WELL, WHERE IS SHE?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.750
- JUST...SIT DOWN.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.542
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

23:45.709 --> 23:47.959
- DEXTER?

23:47.959 --> 23:50.291
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

23:50.291 --> 23:51.959
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE FREAKING--

23:51.959 --> 23:53.375
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

23:55.917 --> 23:59.125
- SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOM.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.542
Cody: SOMETHING BAD?

24:06.041 --> 24:07.959
- YEAH. SOMETHING BAD.

24:07.959 --> 24:10.542
- IS SHE OKAY?

24:12.250 --> 24:15.250
- A MAN CAME INTO OUR HOUSE,

24:15.250 --> 24:17.333
AND YOUR MOTHER CAME HOME AND...

24:17.333 --> 24:18.583
HE KILLED HER.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.417
Cody: WHAT? SHE GOT KILLED?

24:20.417 --> 24:22.125
SOMEBODY KILLED HER?
Astor: NO, SHE'S FINE.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.667
Maura: DEXTER.
WHAT--

24:23.667 --> 24:26.291
Astor: YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
Maura: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:26.291 --> 24:28.792
YOU SAID SPEND THE DAY
AT DISNEY WORLD.

24:28.792 --> 24:30.959
[crying]

24:35.083 --> 24:36.959
- I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

24:36.959 --> 24:38.291
[Maura crying]

24:55.458 --> 24:58.125
ASTOR?
- GO AWAY.

24:58.125 --> 24:59.792
I MEAN IT!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

24:59.792 --> 25:02.500
- JUST...LISTEN TO ME.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.083
- IT WON'T BE.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.542
SHE'S DEAD!

25:06.542 --> 25:08.625
- I KNOW.

25:08.625 --> 25:11.208
- AND IT DOESN'T EVEN
MATTER TO YOU.

25:11.208 --> 25:13.625
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

25:13.625 --> 25:15.500
- 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.208
I CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.667
WHERE WERE YOU?

25:23.667 --> 25:26.625
WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN SOMEONE WAS KILLING HER?

25:26.625 --> 25:30.250
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
TO PROTECT HER.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.291
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:32.291 --> 25:35.959
- THAT WAS YOUR  JOB!
- I KNOW.

25:35.959 --> 25:37.917
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE,

25:37.917 --> 25:39.834
AND I WISH I COULD
TAKE IT ALL BACK.

25:39.834 --> 25:42.041
I WISH...THAT NONE OF THIS
HAD EVER HAPPENED

25:42.041 --> 25:44.333
AND YOUR MOM
WAS STILL ALIVE.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.458
- WANNA KNOW WHAT I WISH?

25:46.458 --> 25:50.667
THAT IT WAS JUST MY MOM
AND ME AND CODY AND HARRISON.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.709
'CAUSE WE ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO MUCH BETTER OFF

25:52.709 --> 25:54.750
IF SHE HADN'T MET YOU!

25:56.083 --> 25:58.834
I WISH YOU  WERE DEAD!

26:21.959 --> 26:24.208
- DO YOU MIND?
- WHAT?

26:24.208 --> 26:26.709
- LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE.

26:39.417 --> 26:40.750
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:40.750 --> 26:44.417
- JESUS, QUINN, YOU CAN'T
GRAB A SHEET OR SOMETHING?

26:44.417 --> 26:46.208
- OH. SORRY.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.583
SO...WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:48.583 --> 26:49.917
- TRYING TO FIND A DRESS
FOR RITA.

26:49.917 --> 26:51.250
- YOU GONNA BURY HER
IN ONE OF THOSE?

26:51.250 --> 26:53.875
- YOU GOT SOMETHING BETTER?

26:58.417 --> 27:00.583
GREAT. I-I GOTTA GO.

27:00.583 --> 27:03.000
I GOTTA GO HOME NOW.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.917
- YOU MIGHT WANNA
PUT SOME PANTS ON THERE.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.875
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT,
OR YOU JUST GONNA ACT WEIRD?

27:09.875 --> 27:11.542
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.875
- OKAY.

27:12.875 --> 27:15.291
- I MEAN...
YOU SHOW UP HERE,

27:15.291 --> 27:17.709
WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN
ASK YOU TO DO, SO...

27:17.709 --> 27:19.583
- YEAH. TO HELP.

27:19.583 --> 27:21.166
- IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT?

27:21.166 --> 27:23.792
- MORGAN.

27:23.792 --> 27:25.417
[engine turns]

27:39.208 --> 27:41.375
ELLIOT?

27:41.375 --> 27:42.959
THAT'S YOUR NAME, RIGHT?

27:42.959 --> 27:44.333
- YEAH.

- HI. QUINN.
METRO HOMICIDE.

43:15.458 --> 43:16.750
HEY, YOU.

43:16.750 --> 43:18.917
- HEY...YOU.

43:18.917 --> 43:20.583
IT'S RITA.

43:20.583 --> 43:22.458
- YEAH, I KNOW.

43:22.458 --> 43:24.500
- I WAS JUST CHECKING IN.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.750
WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WERE
FEELING BETTER.

43:26.750 --> 43:28.709
- MUCH BETTER.

43:28.709 --> 43:31.000
- GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
[splash]

43:31.000 --> 43:32.667
THE WAY YOU LEFT
THE RESTAURANT SO QUICKLY,

43:32.667 --> 43:34.417
I DON'T KNOW,
I FELT MAYBE I...

43:34.417 --> 43:36.208
SAID SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU.

43:36.208 --> 43:37.750
- NO, YOU WERE FINE.

43:37.750 --> 43:38.750
[splash]

43:38.750 --> 43:41.250
UH, VERY UNDERSTANDING.

43:43.750 --> 43:47.917
- I-I WASN'T COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU. UM...

43:47.917 --> 43:50.500
- YOU DIDN'T REALLY
GET STUCK IN TRAFFIC?

43:50.500 --> 43:53.083
- [laughs]

43:53.083 --> 43:56.417
I HAVE TWO KIDS.
ASTOR AND CODY.

43:56.417 --> 43:58.625
THEY'RE 9 AND 7.

43:58.625 --> 44:01.458
- I LIKE KIDS.

44:01.458 --> 44:04.291
- YOU DO?

44:04.291 --> 44:05.458
- YEAH, THEY'RE FUN.

44:05.458 --> 44:08.792
BESIDES,
DEB ALREADY TOLD ME.

44:08.792 --> 44:12.542
- AND MY EX-HUSBAND
AND OUR...PROBLEMS?

44:12.542 --> 44:14.000
DID SHE TELL YOU?

44:14.000 --> 44:15.875
- YEAH.

44:15.875 --> 44:19.875
- SO YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME.

44:19.875 --> 44:22.750
- I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE.

44:22.750 --> 44:25.125
- [laughs]

44:25.125 --> 44:26.917
SO...

44:26.917 --> 44:30.667
- SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET TOGETHER AGAIN SOMETIME.

44:32.500 --> 44:35.458
- I WOULD LIKE THAT.
A LOT.

44:35.458 --> 44:37.291
A LOT.
[laughs]

44:37.291 --> 44:40.458
I KNOW I SHOULD
HANG UP RIGHT NOW,

44:40.458 --> 44:42.583
BUT I JUST NEED TO SAY IT.

44:42.583 --> 44:47.166
UM, I DON'T KNOW
WHY EXACTLY, BUT...

44:47.166 --> 44:50.500
YOU MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

44:50.500 --> 44:53.166
LIKE THINGS COULD BE DIFFERENT.

44:53.166 --> 44:56.166
- SO DO YOU.

44:56.166 --> 44:59.959
MAKE ME FEEL THAT WAY...
TOO, I MEAN.

44:59.959 --> 45:01.583
- GLAD I CALLED.

45:01.583 --> 45:03.417
I DON'T KNOW, I FELT...

45:03.417 --> 45:06.291
UP IN THE AIR
THE WAY THINGS ENDED.

45:06.291 --> 45:10.583
YOU KNOW, LIKE WE NEVER
SAID A PROPER GOOD-BYE, SO...

45:10.583 --> 45:13.166
- GOOD-BYE, RITA BENNETT.

45:13.166 --> 45:17.834
- GOOD-BYE, DEXTER MORGAN.

45:23.542 --> 45:25.834
- GOOD-BYE.

45:28.208 --> 45:30.875
I'M SORRY.

45:34.542 --> 45:37.375
[engine sputters]

45:58.125 --> 46:02.250
[wind chimes clanging]

46:02.250 --> 46:06.917
[bell dinging]

46:08.834 --> 46:10.083
[pounding on counter]

46:10.083 --> 46:11.792
- WHERE'S THE KEY
TO THE FUCKING BATHROOM?

46:11.792 --> 46:15.291
OR SHOULD I JUST DUMP
OUT ON THE FLOOR?

46:20.208 --> 46:22.291
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

46:22.291 --> 46:24.417
- NOTHING.

46:24.417 --> 46:25.959
- FUCKING RETARD.

46:25.959 --> 46:27.667
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!

46:27.667 --> 46:30.709
- HE'S RIGHT.
I SHOULD KEEP MOVING.

46:39.875 --> 46:41.667
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
HEY.

46:43.834 --> 46:45.041
I SAID...

46:45.041 --> 46:46.959
WHAT THE FUCK
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

46:48.458 --> 46:50.500
- I'VE HAD A BAD WEEK.

46:50.500 --> 46:53.917
MY WIFE DIED,
AND IT WAS MY FAULT.

46:53.917 --> 46:56.709
- WELL, I'M REAL SORRY
FOR YOUR FUCKIN' LOSS,

46:56.709 --> 46:59.834
BUT YOUR DEAD WIFE
CAN SUCK MY DICK.

47:07.709 --> 47:09.834
- I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT HER.

47:22.959 --> 47:26.000
[wet crunching sound]

47:48.125 --> 47:50.709
- THAT'S THE FIRST HUMAN THING
I'VE SEEN YOU DO

47:50.709 --> 47:54.333
SINCE SHE DIED, DEXTER.

47:54.333 --> 47:57.208
- I THOUGHT YOU'D LEFT ME.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.667
- I'M HERE.

48:06.458 --> 48:09.667
IT'S OKAY, SON...

48:09.667 --> 48:12.834
TO SHOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

48:16.542 --> 48:21.208
- [whimpering]

48:21.208 --> 48:24.709
[louder groaning]

48:24.709 --> 48:27.500
[shrieking]

48:28.709 --> 48:30.500
[screams]

48:36.750 --> 48:39.625
- THEY'RE NOT BETTER OFF
WITHOUT YOU.

48:39.625 --> 48:43.125
YOU'RE NOT BETTER OFF
WITHOUT THEM.

48:43.125 --> 48:46.041
YOU NEED TO GO BACK.

49:03.458 --> 49:06.083
- DEB SAYS
SHE'S SURE HE'LL BE HERE.

49:06.083 --> 49:08.083
BETTER BE.
IF WE DON'T GET GOING SOON,

49:08.083 --> 49:12.125
WE'LL BE BURYING RITA
BY CANDLELIGHT.

49:16.750 --> 49:18.583
SO YOU'RE NOT...
TALKING TO ME NOW?

49:18.583 --> 49:21.083
IS THAT IT?

49:21.083 --> 49:23.792
- I HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.

49:27.667 --> 49:29.583
- YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU HAVE.

49:31.917 --> 49:34.375
I JUST NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND...

49:34.375 --> 49:35.917
- SO TELL ME.

49:35.917 --> 49:38.583
- I COULD HAVE FOUGHT
FOR THIS CASE, BUT...

49:38.583 --> 49:40.959
PART OF ME DIDN'T WANT TO.

49:42.667 --> 49:46.750
RITA...DIED.

49:48.291 --> 49:52.792
SHE DIED, AND IT SCARED ME.

49:52.792 --> 49:55.083
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED, WHAT,
TEN HOURS?

49:57.000 --> 49:58.917
DEXTER WAS THE WITNESS
AT OUR CEREMONY.

49:58.917 --> 50:00.125
FOR ALL I KNOW,

50:00.125 --> 50:02.667
HE WAS THERE WITH US
WHILE SHE WAS...

50:02.667 --> 50:05.375
BEING...
- I KNOW.

50:07.166 --> 50:10.875
- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
REMINDED OF THAT.

50:10.875 --> 50:14.417
I DIDN'T WANT TO INVESTIGATE.

50:14.417 --> 50:16.083
I JUST WANTED...

50:16.083 --> 50:18.917
I JUST WANTED IT TO BE
OUR WEDDING DAY.

50:18.917 --> 50:21.250
OH...

50:21.250 --> 50:23.417
I DON'T LIKE IT, ANGEL.

50:23.417 --> 50:25.166
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THIS MAKES ME FEEL.

50:25.166 --> 50:26.583
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH ANY OF IT.

50:26.583 --> 50:28.125
- MARIA.
- [sobs]

50:30.208 --> 50:32.667
WHAT?

50:32.667 --> 50:35.208
- NO ONE DOES.

50:43.125 --> 50:47.291
- WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN HIS OWN WIFE'S FUNERAL?

50:47.291 --> 50:49.667
PEOPLE ARE GETTING RESTLESS.

50:49.667 --> 50:54.250
- THANK YOU FOR REPORTING IN
WITH THE OBVIOUS, QUINN.

50:54.250 --> 50:57.834
LIKE I'M SUCH A MORON
THAT IT'S LOST ON ME.

50:57.834 --> 51:00.250
YOU EVER GIVEN A EULOGY?

51:00.250 --> 51:01.542
- NO.

51:01.542 --> 51:03.250
- WELL, I CAN'T DO IT.

51:03.250 --> 51:05.750
AND THOSE AGENTS,
THOSE VULTURES

51:05.750 --> 51:07.542
ARE JUST WAITING FOR HIM.

51:07.542 --> 51:09.041
- LOOK...

51:09.041 --> 51:11.667
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW.

51:11.667 --> 51:14.083
- WHAT?

51:14.083 --> 51:16.458
- IT'S NOT EXACTLY
AN EASY THING TO SAY.

51:16.458 --> 51:20.000
THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR ELLIOT,
I SPOKE TO HIM THE OTHER DAY.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.542
- WHAT THE FUCK?
- I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE...

51:59.250 --> 52:02.291
- SHE HAD A BIG HEART.

52:04.709 --> 52:08.709
BIG ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.792
HAD TO BE.

52:11.792 --> 52:17.625
I WASN'T EVEN HUMAN...

52:17.625 --> 52:19.959
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

52:19.959 --> 52:24.291
I NEVER EXPECTED THAT
TO CHANGE.

52:24.291 --> 52:26.000
SHE REACHED OUT
AND FOUND SOMETHING

52:26.000 --> 52:28.667
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WAS THERE.

52:28.667 --> 52:32.250
SHE NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.625
SHE WAS INNOCENT.

52:37.959 --> 52:40.125
AND SHE DIED A BRUTAL DEATH
AND...

52:40.125 --> 52:45.583
AND I CAN'T...

52:45.583 --> 52:47.583
FIX IT.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.333
BUT I KNOW I HAVE TO TRY...

53:01.834 --> 53:04.959
HERE IN MIAMI WITH THE PEOPLE
WHO KNEW HER

53:04.959 --> 53:07.166
AND WHO--WHO...

53:09.667 --> 53:12.291
WHO CARED ABOUT HER.

53:14.333 --> 53:17.792
AND WHO LOVED HER.

53:23.333 --> 53:25.834
LIKE I DID.
