5/7/7.

00:28.980 --> 00:32.768
For this next one,
you need to be very, very quiet.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.600
["Fascination Street" playing]

00:42.910 --> 00:45.162
Because you ’re about to do
something very wrong.

00:54.260 --> 00:55.249
Be careful.

00:56.470 --> 00:57.585
Ano’ don ’t get caught

01:02.140 --> 01:05.268
Have you ever wondered what
it would feel Me to watch someone?

01:06.350 --> 01:08.261
To in vao’e someone’s privacy?

01:12.030 --> 01:14.521
Do you wonder what secrets
you might uncover?

01:18.700 --> 01:20.941
What skeletons you might turn up?

01:23.330 --> 01:25.958
Well, for this next one,
you ’re about to find out.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.207
A-4 on your map, kio’s.

01:32.130 --> 01:34.451
- Oh, it’s opening time

01:34.550 --> 01:37.087
-Mother. ..
- Down on Fascination Street

01:37.180 --> 01:39.387
So lets cut the conversation

01:39.470 --> 01:41.256
And get out for a bit

01:41.850 --> 01:44.808
Because I feel it all fao’ing
Ano’ ,oa/r'ng. . .

01:44.890 --> 01:47.381
[Hannah]
lVow, o’on’tsay you ’re too afraid

01:47.480 --> 01:50.392
or that you don ’t feel comfortable
doing this kino’ of thing,

01:50.480 --> 01:51.606
because guess what?

01:52.770 --> 01:55.102
You spy on people every day.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.602
But if you open your mouth

01:58.700 --> 02:01.191
Then I can ’t be respons/b/e...

02:02.160 --> 02:03.980
We ’re always watching someone.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.240
Fol/owing someone.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.859
And being followed.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.325
Just pull on your pout

02:10.420 --> 02:12.832
And let’s move to the beat

02:12.960 --> 02:15.167
ere we know that it’s over

they’ve made us a society of stalkers

02:26.640 --> 02:27.595
And we love it.

[car alarm blaring]

02:37.530 --> 02:38.736
[alarm chirps]

02:38.820 --> 02:43.325
Of course, stalking someone
in real life is a whole ’nother thing.

02:55.210 --> 02:56.336
Thatis ”gm:

02:57.380 --> 02:58.586
I had a stalker.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.831
And if you ’ve made it to .44,
you ’re outside his wino’ow.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.006
Just l/ke .7 am...

03:06.100 --> 03:07.055
right now.

03:09.810 --> 03:11.186
Any guesses yet?

03:11.770 --> 03:12.759
No?

03:13.860 --> 03:18.229
Well, stay tuned to hear
about the skeletons he dug up.

03:18.820 --> 03:19.775
For now...

03:20.490 --> 03:22.230
let's see if he's got any of his own.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.861
I get that it's a thrill...

03:26.990 --> 03:28.742
looking into someone's life.

03:30.870 --> 03:32.610
My heart's pounding right now.

03:32.710 --> 03:33.825
Can you hear it?

03:34.080 --> 03:34.910
Listen.

03:38.420 --> 03:41.253
[heart beating rapidly]

03:53.850 --> 03:54.851
Marcus!

03:54.940 --> 03:56.476
You asshole. What the hell...?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.435
-What are you doing?
-Sorry, okay?

03:59.030 --> 04:00.930
I said your name, like, three times.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.907
What are you...

04:04.780 --> 04:05.610
wearing?

04:05.700 --> 04:07.110
Oh, I totally forgot.

The tropical storm?

04:14.210 --> 04:15.495
No? Okay.

04:15.790 --> 04:18.839
Wow, I really hope you're not
one of the judges tomorrow, 'cause--

04:18.920 --> 04:20.501
Marcus, what are you doing?

04:20.590 --> 04:22.797
The costume contest.
Two hundred bucks.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.620
Here... what are you doing out here?

04:24.720 --> 04:25.709
Oh.

04:26.010 --> 04:27.136
I heard you, man.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.012
The car alarm. I live right over there.

04:30.100 --> 04:33.058
Besides, you're not the first one
to come look at the famous window.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.266
We all did it.

04:35.850 --> 04:37.477
And we all took our shot.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.350
Wait, "we"?

04:41.150 --> 04:41.980
Are you on the...?

04:43.860 --> 04:45.521
Why? What did you do?

04:45.610 --> 04:47.908
Who knows? Okay? I didn't listen.

04:47.990 --> 04:49.867
I just started each tape
till I heard who it was,

04:49.950 --> 04:52.157
figured out who came after me,
and passed 'em on.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.416
But what about the second set?

04:55.500 --> 04:58.913
-Hannah said that if we don't listen--
-Hannah said. Dude, Hannah's dead.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.336
I'm sorry, but it's true.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.586
Nothing anyone did to her
was any different

05:03.670 --> 05:05.831
than what happens to every girl
at every high school.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.130
She just wanted attention.

05:09.550 --> 05:11.552
And leaving those tapes...

05:11.640 --> 05:14.347
that's a fucked-up thing to do!
No one deserves that.

05:16.690 --> 05:17.588
[light switch clicks]

05:20.610 --> 05:22.601
Except maybe that psycho.

05:24.570 --> 05:25.810
[Clay] Tyler Down?

05:27.450 --> 05:31.659
Dude, listen, take your shot
and pass those things on, man.

05:31.950 --> 05:33.281
You'll feel better.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.247
[sighs] We need to get
this window fixed, Tyler.

05:43.340 --> 05:44.876
It's time.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.506
[Tyler] They're just gonna break it again.

05:47.220 --> 05:48.539
Who are these kids?

05:48.640 --> 05:49.675
We need names.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.502
I want to report it to the school
or to the police.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.589
No.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.978
We don't need to. Just forget it.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.846
I don't know who they are, Dad, okay?

05:58.020 --> 05:59.339
Why are they doing this?

05:59.520 --> 06:00.555
I said I don't know, okay?

06:00.650 --> 06:02.891
Can I just do my homework, please?

06:03.570 --> 06:04.776
Yeah.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.908
[Hannah]
Welcome to your tape, 7'y/er Down.

06:08.990 --> 06:09.979
Good night.

06:10.660 --> 06:11.695
So, tell me...

06:12.530 --> 06:13.531
when did it start?

06:14.660 --> 06:16.787
How long were you watching me, Tyler?

06:16.870 --> 06:18.326
I can't believe you don't like them.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.240
Look, I'm just saying, I don't...

06:20.330 --> 06:23.959
Okay, vampires, aliens,
even werewolves, I get it.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.416
I get the motivation,
I get the metaphors, right?

06:26.510 --> 06:27.909
But, like, zombies?

06:28.010 --> 06:29.045
They're just...

06:29.130 --> 06:30.336
They're just stupid.

06:31.430 --> 06:33.000
So you hate zombies?

06:33.850 --> 06:35.215
You're a zombie racist.

06:36.810 --> 06:38.175
Just, like, I don't understand 'em.

06:38.270 --> 06:39.259
What's their story?

06:39.350 --> 06:43.684
They don't want to take over the world,
kill their masters, anything interesting.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.021
They're not good or evil.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.102
They're just hungry... for brains.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.440
I mean, like, brains.

06:53.660 --> 06:54.945
Well...

06:55.040 --> 06:56.075
thank you...

06:56.490 --> 06:57.900
for walking me home.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.452
And for destroying all future
zombie media for me forever.

07:03.420 --> 07:04.455
Anytime.

07:17.060 --> 07:18.129
Asshole.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.106
Turn around, dude.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.026
[Hannah]
1' o’io’n ’1' really think
anything of it at first

07:36.950 --> 07:38.030
[camera clicks]

07:40.500 --> 07:42.821
Must have been the souno’
of a tree branch in the wind.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.166
[clicking]

07:54.300 --> 07:55.790
But the sound followed me.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.520
[clicking continues]

08:41.140 --> 08:42.880
I was too scareo’ to move...

08:44.850 --> 08:46.010
even to shut the blinds.

08:59.660 --> 09:01.116
And if we tear this room apart--

09:01.200 --> 09:04.283
I don't want to tear this room apart,
and I'm not sure I want to fight.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.531
We have to. For Hannah.

09:06.670 --> 09:07.659
What about for us?

09:08.250 --> 09:10.127
Honey, our daughter is gone.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.160
Christ, Andy, I know that!

09:12.420 --> 09:13.409
I have to know why.

09:13.510 --> 09:15.216
I
need
to know why.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.461
And if you don't, I...

09:32.150 --> 09:34.106
[Hannah]
I o'io’n’ts/eep much that night.

09:35.150 --> 09:36.481
You should know.

09:37.160 --> 09:41.403
But then, the pictures you took that n/ght
aren ’t the reason you ’re on this tape,

09:41.490 --> 09:42.320
are they?

09:43.450 --> 09:45.611
We ’re talking about one picture
in particular.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.917
Goddamn it, Tyler.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.120
[Mr. Jensen] How bad is it?

09:51.170 --> 09:52.330
Oh, um...

09:53.000 --> 09:54.001
Hey, Dad.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.546
How bad is what?

09:56.630 --> 09:58.586
I'll never forget my first hangover.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.211
Uh... Yeah. First.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.130
Is that what I'm feeling?

10:03.470 --> 10:04.459
Ugh.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.349
I prefer to leave my lectures
in the lecture hall, but, you know...

10:09.310 --> 10:12.222
there's actually an important lesson
to be learned from a hangover.

10:13.650 --> 10:15.356
Don't drink?

10:15.990 --> 10:19.699
Sure, but... you'll drink. It happens.

10:19.780 --> 10:23.659
The overarching lesson is that
actions have consequences.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.367
Judging from the way you look,

10:25.450 --> 10:27.577
you've probably suffered
enough for today.

10:29.750 --> 10:30.990
What is that?

10:31.130 --> 10:34.497
Hot sauce, horseradish,
kale, a raw egg,

10:34.590 --> 10:37.798
and, uh, about six other things
designed to cure a hangover.

10:39.470 --> 10:40.505
Oh, no, don't smell it.

10:40.590 --> 10:42.000
Just drink.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.131
[clears throat]

10:48.850 --> 10:53.810
So, listen, uh, I talked to Mom
about the grounding situation

10:53.900 --> 10:55.720
and all it entails,

10:55.820 --> 11:01.406
and I managed to convince her
to stay her ruling, on one condition:

11:02.780 --> 11:04.771
You gotta start opening up to us, kid.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.288
Just... you know,
let us know what's going on.

11:09.410 --> 11:11.241
Only enough to keep us informed.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.378
And your mother also prefers...

11:14.710 --> 11:16.200
no more closed doors.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.257
Literal and figurative.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.802
Oh, and no big spread this morning.

11:25.890 --> 11:27.767
It's just us, so cereal okay?

11:31.140 --> 11:32.300
Wait, where's Mom?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.015
So, mood swings.

11:34.310 --> 11:37.359
Refusal to participate
in group activities,

11:37.440 --> 11:38.600
change in their appearance...

11:38.690 --> 11:40.601
You're making me feel
like a bad student.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.441
I'm starting to feel like a bad parent.

11:43.530 --> 11:44.986
...declining GPA...

11:45.700 --> 11:47.440
and substance abuse.

11:47.580 --> 11:51.209
Now, paying close attention to
these warning signs can help you

11:51.290 --> 11:55.124
prevent your children
from making a terrible mistake.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.299
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Porter,
for that informative presentation.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.928
If anybody has questions,
we're happy to answer now.

12:02.930 --> 12:03.885
Yeah?

12:04.300 --> 12:06.382
What can you tell us about this lawsuit?

12:06.510 --> 12:07.886
Was that girl bullied?

12:07.970 --> 12:11.133
Actually, legally, we are
not allowed to discuss that,

12:11.230 --> 12:16.350
but we can all become more involved
In our children's lives, okay?

12:16.440 --> 12:18.101
And that starts at home.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.313
Should we be worried about
our own kids being bullied?

12:22.570 --> 12:26.154
In our experience,
relative to many other schools,

12:26.240 --> 12:29.118
we do not have a problem with bullying.

12:29.700 --> 12:30.997
Then why did that girl do it?

12:31.080 --> 12:34.368
That girl's name is Hannah.

12:37.540 --> 12:38.746
Mrs. Baker.

12:38.840 --> 12:42.003
It's so good to see you.
We didn't know you'd be joining us.

12:42.090 --> 12:44.627
Well, I'm still a member of
the school community, right?

12:47.470 --> 12:49.051
And if you want to know why...

12:49.890 --> 12:51.676
I suggest you ask your own children.

12:52.850 --> 12:57.514
Or take a look at the walls
of the restrooms they use every day.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.646
"Bitch."

12:59.730 --> 13:00.776
"Slut."

13:00.860 --> 13:01.679
"Whore."

13:02.320 --> 13:04.140
"Die." Die!

13:04.240 --> 13:08.313
These are the words carved on
the walls of the bathrooms they use,

13:08.410 --> 13:11.038
and
your
kids did the carving.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.160
[bell rings]

13:21.460 --> 13:22.290
Tyler.

13:24.380 --> 13:25.756
Wait, hey, Tyler.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.465
Tyler. Hey.

13:35.310 --> 13:36.129
I'm sorry, man.

13:36.940 --> 13:38.555
[Justin] This fucking chain is gay.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.272
-I look like a punk rock dog.
-Mmm-hmm.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.232
What? Justin, what?
You said you wanted to do this.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.447
I do. I'm here, right?

13:50.370 --> 13:51.268
I'm doing it.

13:52.410 --> 13:54.037
What the fuck are you looking at, Jensen?

13:54.580 --> 13:56.571
He's checking out our awesome costumes.

13:56.660 --> 13:58.070
Clay gets it, right?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.376
Yeah.

13:59.460 --> 14:03.044
Sid Vicious, born John Ritchie,
bassist for the Sex Pistols,

14:03.130 --> 14:04.620
and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen.

14:04.710 --> 14:05.916
Nice.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.882
But you know how the story ends, right?

14:09.470 --> 14:10.960
What? How does the story end?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.169
Thanks, Clay.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.215
How does the story end?

14:14.100 --> 14:15.670
I don't know. I think you kill me.

14:15.770 --> 14:16.634
Alex, hey.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.147
Alex! Hey.

14:21.270 --> 14:22.430
Have you seen Tyler?

14:22.730 --> 14:23.719
Why?

14:25.070 --> 14:26.355
I did research about what he did.

14:27.110 --> 14:29.988
-I think that we should--
-No, see, there's no "we," okay?

14:30.070 --> 14:33.028
You should be very careful
about who you talk to.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.281
There he is!

14:34.370 --> 14:35.780
Jensen!

14:35.870 --> 14:38.782
Nice work last night, buddy.
You can hold your booze.

14:38.870 --> 14:40.497
Yeah, I bet he puked like a bitch.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.956
Fuck you, Dempsey.

14:42.170 --> 14:44.240
You puked on three wine coolers
last weekend.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.257
Yeah, because they were strawberry.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.000
I'm allergic.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.923
I'm having a Halloween thing
at my place, super small.

14:51.010 --> 14:51.829
You should come.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.709
Alex will be there.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.261
I uh,

14:56.350 --> 14:57.590
I'll think about it.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.432
What, you got something else to do?

14:59.520 --> 15:00.896
How about French?

15:01.560 --> 15:02.720
Madame Steinberg?

15:03.020 --> 15:04.681
You needed help with the homework.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.271
Why would I need your help...

15:06.360 --> 15:08.772
I mean, yeah, sure. Whatever.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.197
[bell rings]

15:12.280 --> 15:14.020
[Bryce] Think about it, Jensen.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.491
I have a better grade than you in French.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.615
I was just trying to help.

15:19.910 --> 15:20.740
-Yea h?
-Yeah.

15:20.830 --> 15:23.207
Where was your help last night?
Where'd you go?

15:24.380 --> 15:25.369
I had a family thing.

15:26.590 --> 15:28.046
-Family thing?
-Yeah.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.079
That's good.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.595
[principal] ”
Megan is a whore and a... ”

15:41.690 --> 15:44.181
what on earth is a "cum dumpster"?

15:44.270 --> 15:47.478
[Mr. Porter] Well, sir, I assume... well,
it could be a guy or a girl, actually.

15:47.570 --> 15:48.810
[principal] Oh, Jesus Christ.

15:49.070 --> 15:51.698
These kids, they can't even spell,

15:51.780 --> 15:53.099
and they come up with this shit.

15:55.370 --> 15:57.406
How have we never seen this before?

15:58.160 --> 16:01.869
Oh, well, faculty is not supposed
to be in the students' restroom.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.953
I could call the janitorial staff and
see if they could repaint these walls.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.372
Well, I think we should, although...

16:08.920 --> 16:13.004
[sighs] I don't know how this is going
to calm Olivia Baker at all.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.079
Yeah.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.671
I'm wondering if her husband
is any more reasonable.

16:17.180 --> 16:21.014
I actually know Andy a bit.
I shop at their store.

16:22.810 --> 16:25.222
I understand about the grief, all right?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.469
It's just the...

16:26.560 --> 16:28.312
It's the grasping for blame.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.185
It's just graffiti, right?

16:31.360 --> 16:33.396
Oh, my God!

16:34.780 --> 16:37.829
[teacher] In honor of Halloween,
your in-class essay today

16:37.910 --> 16:41.494
will analyze this quote from chapter four
of
Beyond Good and E v/l:

16:42.160 --> 16:45.118
"Whoever fights monsters should see to it

16:45.210 --> 16:47.166
that he does not become a monster."

16:47.880 --> 16:48.949
Psst.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.376
I'm worried about you, Clay.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.080
Why aren't you entering
the costume contest?

16:56.430 --> 16:58.091
Because I'm not wearing a costume.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.303
[teacher] Can you think of
the abyss in your own life?

17:02.140 --> 17:06.099
Can you think of an occasion in the book
where the protagonist lost their way?

17:08.230 --> 17:09.970
-What monsters have you...
-Psst.

17:12.190 --> 17:13.316
You're gonna get in trouble.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.156
Watch and learn.

17:20.950 --> 17:23.578
-You sleep in class?
-Are you kidding?

17:23.660 --> 17:25.070
With my schedule,

17:25.160 --> 17:27.116
power naps are essential.

17:27.830 --> 17:29.377
I just couldn't sleep last night.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.830
Obsessing over the history exam?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.159
Uh, no.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.330
About who you're going to take
to Winter Formal?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.500
People take people to that?

17:38.590 --> 17:39.887
Quiet study, please.

17:46.230 --> 17:47.470
What else has you up nights?

17:51.690 --> 17:53.521
I think there's someone outside my window.

17:54.190 --> 17:55.566
What, like a burglar?

17:56.610 --> 17:58.908
Like someone taking pictures.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.110
No way!

18:01.200 --> 18:02.280
Shh.

18:08.290 --> 18:10.531
Nothing that interesting
ever happens to me.

18:10.630 --> 18:13.952
I'm not sure "interesting"
is the first word that comes to mind.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.126
It's sort of awful.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.256
You have to do something about it.

18:19.340 --> 18:20.546
Like what?

18:20.640 --> 18:21.629
I don't know.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.959
But I'll help.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.419
[teacher] Girls.

18:43.370 --> 18:45.406
I didn't realize you were
taking photography.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.958
Yep, the project is all about contrast,

18:48.290 --> 18:50.497
which is why we have to do it at night,

18:50.580 --> 18:52.582
and which is why I have to sleep over.

18:53.170 --> 18:55.582
-It's due tomorrow.
-I see.

18:56.170 --> 18:59.128
I would like your parents' number,
just in case.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.006
Already put the Bakers in your contacts.

19:01.090 --> 19:02.796
You'll make sure to text me
before you go to bed?

19:02.890 --> 19:03.788
Yes.

19:03.890 --> 19:05.801
And you're sure
you don't want me to help--

19:05.890 --> 19:07.300
I've got it, Dad, really.

19:07.390 --> 19:08.516
Okay, okay.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.312
He's very involved.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.436
That's the worst, right?

19:16.530 --> 19:17.565
No, it's cool.

19:18.030 --> 19:20.487
I like that you can just talk to him.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.729
I wish I could do that.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.447
Grass is always greener, I guess.

19:27.580 --> 19:30.117
That was the first time
I've ever lied to either of them.

19:31.790 --> 19:33.326
Welcome to the dark side.

19:33.420 --> 19:34.580
[evil laugh]

19:41.180 --> 19:42.716
Technically, it's for bears.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.554
Supposedly, like, blinds the bears,
giving you time to run away.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.965
So, who do you think it could be?

19:49.060 --> 19:50.379
I don't know,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.550
but there's this
creepy old dude on the corner

19:52.650 --> 19:55.392
who walks with an umbrella
on perfectly sunny days.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.936
-Weird.
-Exactly.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.428
My money's on him.

19:58.530 --> 20:02.148
He's gonna need more than an umbrella to
block the rays of this thing. Wanna see?

20:03.410 --> 20:05.059
You may want to look away.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.951
[Ryan] I'm amazed you still shoot on film.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.826
I shoot all different ways,

20:13.920 --> 20:16.662
but film really makes you focus
on the image you're creating.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.627
It's not just there for you on a screen.

20:19.170 --> 20:20.455
These are...

20:22.340 --> 20:23.546
really good.

20:24.590 --> 20:25.420
Yeah.

20:25.510 --> 20:27.250
I need you to print a few
for the tribute issue.

20:27.350 --> 20:28.669
-Okay.
-Can you get them in time?

20:28.760 --> 20:30.387
Yeah, I'm already started.

20:34.190 --> 20:35.259
That one.

20:39.190 --> 20:40.020
That one.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.309
This candid.

20:45.660 --> 20:46.479
Wow.

20:47.660 --> 20:48.524
This one.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.701
You really did capture her, didn't you?

20:55.710 --> 20:56.745
Um...

20:57.380 --> 20:59.029
I've really got a lot of work to do.

20:59.130 --> 21:00.119
Do you think you could...?

21:00.210 --> 21:01.541
-Yeah.
-Yeah, okay, cool.

21:03.510 --> 21:05.171
Yeah, no, um...

21:19.230 --> 21:20.060
[door closes]

21:20.150 --> 21:21.890
[Clay] You've got a real eye.

21:22.940 --> 21:25.488
Jesus, Clay,
what are you doing in here?

21:26.820 --> 21:30.574
Just seeing what our prize-winning
photographer is working on.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.115
Interesting stuff.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.406
Well, no, don't.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.242
This is all for yearbook only.
You're not supposed to be here.

21:36.330 --> 21:40.164
Really? You're gonna
call me out on trespassing?

21:40.250 --> 21:41.239
I heard your tape.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.911
And throwing a rock
through my window isn't enough?

21:44.010 --> 21:45.329
I didn't throw one.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.579
So, what do you want, then?

21:48.680 --> 21:50.966
I want you to delete
the photos you took.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.096
Destroy the negatives. Whatever.

21:53.180 --> 21:55.728
-Or I'm turning you in.
-Turning me in?

21:56.270 --> 21:58.306
What, are you gonna turn everybody in?

21:59.400 --> 22:00.890
Like Justin and Alex?

22:00.980 --> 22:01.810
You stalked her.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.277
I'm the student life photographer, okay?

22:04.360 --> 22:05.896
I stalk everybody. It's my job.

22:05.990 --> 22:08.447
That means you stand
outside everyone's windows?

22:08.530 --> 22:10.828
-No, it doesn't mean that.
-That's a relief.

22:10.910 --> 22:13.401
'Cause a first-time offense
IS only SIX months In jail,

22:13.490 --> 22:16.072
but for repeat offenders, that's a year.

22:16.660 --> 22:17.536
That's not a thing.

22:17.620 --> 22:20.123
Criminal invasion of a minor's privacy.
Look it up.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.377
I don't think they'll let you have
a camera in prison,

22:25.460 --> 22:27.337
but maybe you can draw pictures.

22:27.420 --> 22:29.638
-I'm not a criminal.
-You are.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.961
-And you're a creep.
-I just took pictures.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.177
-You humiliated her.
-I didn't mean to.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.056
-You ruined her.
-I loved her!

22:39.810 --> 22:42.051
And I know I barely knew her, but I...

22:43.230 --> 22:44.777
I saw her.

22:45.530 --> 22:48.237
Most people, you put a camera on them,
and they smile.

22:48.650 --> 22:51.904
They pose. They basically fake it.

22:52.410 --> 22:55.322
You don't see them, you see their mask.

22:55.410 --> 22:57.992
Whenever my camera was on Hannah,
she was...

22:59.330 --> 23:00.740
different.

23:02.210 --> 23:03.529
Like, real, and...

23:04.550 --> 23:05.869
I fell in love with that.

23:07.210 --> 23:08.416
Real.

23:08.510 --> 23:12.002
So, yeah, I took pictures of her,
but that's because girls like that

23:12.090 --> 23:15.093
don't hang out
with the yearbook guy, with me.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.307
Why didn't you just talk to her?

23:17.390 --> 23:18.800
[scoffs] Why didn't you?

23:19.690 --> 23:20.679
What do you mean?

23:20.770 --> 23:23.728
Come on, I stalk everybody, remember?

23:25.480 --> 23:26.390
I don't miss much.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.521
You loved her, too.

23:30.110 --> 23:32.772
And all you did was watch her
from the sidelines, so...

23:35.490 --> 23:37.196
I guess we're not so different, are we?

23:37.290 --> 23:41.169
Delete the pictures, Tyler.
Destroy them. All of them.

23:42.790 --> 23:43.779
Come on.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.990
You sure you don't want to keep just one?

23:52.890 --> 23:55.597
[Cheerleader]
Okay, everybody.
Drumro/l, please.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.308
-[students stomping]
-[rock music playing]

23:58.390 --> 24:02.269
Tight race, you guys, but I think
we've narrowed down our finalists.

24:02.350 --> 24:04.853
We're gonna choose the winner by applause.

24:04.940 --> 24:09.604
The costume with the most applause
takes home 200 smackers, so...

24:09.690 --> 24:10.896
[cheering]

24:11.280 --> 24:13.601
Genius is so often misunderstood.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.945
Mud divers!

24:18.040 --> 24:19.405
[cheering]

24:21.290 --> 24:22.609
Hey, you okay?

24:24.210 --> 24:25.029
Yeah.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.836
You kept listening, didn't you?

24:27.540 --> 24:29.121
I know that feeling, man.

24:29.420 --> 24:30.910
Hurts bad, I know it.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.926
Let yourself off the hook.

24:33.010 --> 24:34.125
Hannah's gone.

24:34.220 --> 24:37.098
And it's terrible,
but we've got to live on.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.591
And let go.

24:40.180 --> 24:43.092
Come hang out with everybody tonight.
Bring the tapes.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.976
We'll figure it out.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.061
[rap music playing over speakers]

24:49.150 --> 24:50.435
[all cheering]

24:51.110 --> 24:52.816
Okay, okay, okay.

24:53.110 --> 24:56.159
Ladies and gents,
I think we have a winner!

24:56.280 --> 24:58.771
Justin and Jessica, as sexy punk rockers!

24:58.870 --> 25:00.576
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

25:02.620 --> 25:04.611
Sid and Nancy, for fuck's sake.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.668
Come on! Whoo!

25:08.540 --> 25:10.041
Pathetic, right?

25:11.710 --> 25:14.292
-What?
-The way they celebrate themselves and...

25:14.840 --> 25:16.330
just their whole group. It's...

25:18.550 --> 25:20.598
It's better to stay outside of it all.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.715
You know?

25:21.810 --> 25:23.266
No, I don't know.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.310
[sighs]

26:02.180 --> 26:03.636
[toilet flushes]

26:10.520 --> 26:11.566
Seriously?

26:11.860 --> 26:13.851
You're following me into the bathroom now?

26:16.030 --> 26:17.645
Silent treatment. Wow.

26:20.030 --> 26:21.156
You know what? Good.

26:21.410 --> 26:22.729
'Cause I'm tired of it all aanay.

26:22.910 --> 26:24.571
-C|ay.
-Oh, it speaks!

26:25.200 --> 26:27.282
Clay, those guys are using you.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.746
They just want to shut you down.

26:30.290 --> 26:33.168
And whatever they're offering you,
they're lying.

26:34.130 --> 26:35.199
You lied to me.

26:36.050 --> 26:38.120
You lied about where you were last night.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.882
I saw you. With your brothers.

26:41.970 --> 26:43.380
I saw you beating up that guy.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.967
Or were you just "helping" him too?

26:46.730 --> 26:47.765
Clay.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.305
Clay!

26:53.070 --> 26:54.059
Oh, fuck.

27:07.450 --> 27:09.327
-Sti|| open?
-[Mr. Baker] Still open.

27:11.420 --> 27:12.705
Oh, thank God.

27:13.090 --> 27:16.958
My wife would kill me if I came home
empty-handed again.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.669
Okay.

27:27.100 --> 27:28.089
You got uh,

27:28.180 --> 27:29.511
two different sizes here.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.056
I got two different kids,

27:31.140 --> 27:32.687
two and a half and nine months.

27:32.770 --> 27:34.476
I'm running on fumes here.

27:34.940 --> 27:37.477
I think I slept a few hours last week.

27:38.610 --> 27:39.895
I remember those times.

27:40.150 --> 27:41.230
Oh!

27:44.910 --> 27:46.537
We ran out of these last year.

27:52.330 --> 27:55.242
You know, I fought
having the Walplex move in, too.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.877
I mean, maybe it's open late,
but it's not this, you know?

28:01.090 --> 28:02.216
It's not people we know.

28:03.510 --> 28:05.000
Well, thank you.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.999
We appreciate your business.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.558
'Course, if I've learned anything
from watching high school football,

28:11.640 --> 28:13.688
the bigger team always seems to win.

28:13.770 --> 28:14.850
Am I right?

28:21.990 --> 28:23.059
Um...

28:26.370 --> 28:30.192
Look, I know this whole lawsuit thing

28:30.290 --> 28:32.861
has made it hard to talk to people,

28:32.960 --> 28:37.408
but if you ever needed
someone to talk to...

28:38.840 --> 28:40.796
Not me, of course. That would be...

28:42.300 --> 28:43.540
Um...

28:43.630 --> 28:45.461
I could recommend someone.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.176
You know, a professional.

28:49.770 --> 28:52.477
Yeah, thank you,
that's a very kind offer, but, uh...

28:53.390 --> 28:55.438
I think we're handling it our own way.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.680
Don't forget your keys.

28:58.190 --> 28:59.396
Good luck with your store.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.349
Come on!

29:04.450 --> 29:05.656
["Skeletons" playing]

29:05.740 --> 29:07.651
I guess I ’ve been brur'sed

29:07.740 --> 29:10.117
If we were to speak plain

29:10.700 --> 29:13.612
Every bruise that comes to ﬂesh

29:14.580 --> 29:16.491
Makes its mark

29:17.290 --> 29:20.088
Skeletons in the back yard...

29:23.670 --> 29:25.718
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you guys doing?

29:26.470 --> 29:27.539
Let's go, let's go!

29:28.930 --> 29:29.919
Get out of here.

29:40.900 --> 29:42.640
Drop it, right now!

29:42.900 --> 29:44.982
You stay right there
while I call the police.

29:45.110 --> 29:47.442
-Wait, this wasn't me.
-It's in your hand.

29:47.530 --> 29:49.361
No, I was taking it down. Really.

29:49.490 --> 29:51.538
Mrs. Baker, I knew Hannah.

29:54.450 --> 29:56.031
We used to work together.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.662
I was riding by, and I saw these kids...

30:01.420 --> 30:02.409
You knew Hannah?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.040
I did.

30:08.050 --> 30:09.927
Would you want to come inside?

30:13.680 --> 30:14.726
Sure.

30:27.860 --> 30:28.906
[Courtney] Bye.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.617
We won't be late.

30:31.700 --> 30:34.942
I don't know. Maybe we should just
change the reservations to another night.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.029
They'll be fine.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.112
I think this place will probably
charge the card if we move it.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.660
Wow.

30:40.750 --> 30:42.377
You said you wanted a nice restaurant.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.700
Um, what are you guys still doing here?

30:45.840 --> 30:48.217
Your mother thinks
that we should stay home.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.210
And break date night?

30:50.300 --> 30:51.597
You guys, go.

30:51.930 --> 30:55.388
Do, yeah, date night things
I'm trying not to picture right now.

30:55.470 --> 30:57.597
-The only thing--
-We've got pizza money.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.309
I'm just thinking maybe I should
cook dinner for your new friend.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.563
She's gonna be my new ex-friend
if you guys don't stop acting weird.

31:05.730 --> 31:06.731
-Okay.
-Okay.

31:06.820 --> 31:07.855
All right, have fun.

31:07.940 --> 31:08.941
Thank you.

31:09.030 --> 31:10.236
-I love you.
-Okay, bye.

[door opens]

31:15.990 --> 31:17.036
[exhales]

31:17.120 --> 31:18.326
Alone at last.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.995
Shall we?

31:21.330 --> 31:23.036
Okay, so...

31:23.920 --> 31:27.663
Once it's dark and we hear him
outside the window--

31:27.800 --> 31:29.415
We open the window
and flash the light.

31:29.510 --> 31:32.252
Mm-hmm. And expose creepy umbrella guy.

31:32.340 --> 31:33.841
_ -Aah!
[both giggling]

31:33.970 --> 31:35.631
Oh, my God, don't say "expose."

31:36.600 --> 31:37.669
What if he's...?

31:39.770 --> 31:40.805
Eww.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.219
Eww.

31:43.940 --> 31:44.929
Okay.

31:45.940 --> 31:47.680
For the first time, I'm freaking.

31:47.780 --> 31:48.849
Me too.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.156
Do we need...

31:52.990 --> 31:53.809
courage?

32:08.460 --> 32:09.540
I could use some courage.

32:15.220 --> 32:17.632
My husband was the one who suggested

32:17.720 --> 32:20.302
that we not give out candy this year.

32:22.310 --> 32:25.973
He thought seeing all the kids
would make me too emotional.

32:27.230 --> 32:29.221
Now all it's done is attract them.

32:31.110 --> 32:32.520
I'm really sorry.

32:32.990 --> 32:34.480
Kids can be...

32:34.570 --> 32:35.559
Yes.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.905
They can.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.366
Did you...

32:40.790 --> 32:42.530
Did you want a soda or something?

32:42.620 --> 32:44.702
I'm really fine, thank you.

32:49.420 --> 32:52.298
Hannah didn't have many friends, so I'm...

32:52.880 --> 32:54.791
I'm thrilled to finally meet one.

32:56.050 --> 32:57.096
Clay, was it?

32:57.680 --> 32:58.920
Yes. Clay Jensen.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.557
You do look familiar, though.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.971
You two worked together?

33:03.520 --> 33:04.896
Right. At the Crestmont.

33:04.980 --> 33:06.891
I wonder if she said anything to you.

33:06.980 --> 33:10.939
Did she ever talk to you about
her experiences at school?

33:12.610 --> 33:14.237
Uh, experiences?

33:14.320 --> 33:16.948
I mean, did she ever say anything to you

33:17.030 --> 33:20.443
that would indicate that she might
have been mistreated

33:20.540 --> 33:22.781
or bullied in any way?

33:26.670 --> 33:27.705
I, uh...

33:29.460 --> 33:32.202
we didn't really talk
about that kind of thing, I guess.

33:34.670 --> 33:36.501
Maybe I was more of, um...

33:36.590 --> 33:39.297
an acquaintance than a close friend.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.300
I see.

33:45.640 --> 33:46.891
[sighs]

33:49.690 --> 33:52.227
We moved to this town for a fresh start.

33:53.070 --> 33:54.355
For all of us, but...

33:56.070 --> 33:57.480
especially for Hannah.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.823
[M rs. Baker]
You just ask yourself over and over. ..

34:02.660 --> 34:03.490
what happened?

34:10.920 --> 34:12.626
Todd. Hi.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.125
Andy! Hey!

34:15.970 --> 34:17.005
I, uh, wow,

34:17.090 --> 34:18.717
I guess you got curious too,

34:18.800 --> 34:21.348
about all this Walplex nonsense.

34:21.470 --> 34:22.505
Sure.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.512
Listen, Dr. Mendez
hasn't called in your refill.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.182
It's been a couple of months.
Should I give him a ring?

34:29.270 --> 34:31.306
Uh, no, I'm...

34:31.400 --> 34:32.435
No, there's no need.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.851
Okay, well...

34:36.110 --> 34:37.099
Take care.

34:37.650 --> 34:39.356
Give my best to Olivia, please.

34:42.700 --> 34:43.576
[alarm chirps]

34:58.010 --> 34:59.295
[stops tape]

35:05.350 --> 35:06.760
Thank you for this.

35:08.350 --> 35:09.977
Now I know who's responsible.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.600
You are!

35:14.980 --> 35:17.028
You killed Hannah!

35:17.150 --> 35:18.230
[water running]

35:34.500 --> 35:36.047
[indistinct chatter, giggling]

35:39.010 --> 35:40.420
[Hannah] Who does that? Who...?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.711
The whole thing. Like...

35:48.390 --> 35:49.721
[girls giggling]

35:49.810 --> 35:51.129
Wait. Shut up, wait.

35:51.230 --> 35:53.607
So the whole Justin thing
was just a rumor?

35:54.190 --> 35:56.010
I totally thought you guys went to third.

35:56.110 --> 35:57.646
Nope. Just first.

35:58.110 --> 36:00.988
Also, why someone picked
the most boring sport ever

36:01.070 --> 36:04.198
to mark our sexual milestones
still kind of baffles me.

36:04.660 --> 36:07.322
My God. I am so sorry.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.747
I totally misjudged you.

36:10.250 --> 36:11.285
It's cool.

36:12.330 --> 36:14.207
I misjudge me all the time.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.245
-Boys are assholes.
-[chuckles]

36:17.340 --> 36:20.047
Sometimes I think we'd be
better off without them.

36:20.130 --> 36:21.370
I will drink to that.

36:24.890 --> 36:26.096
[chuckles]

36:26.850 --> 36:28.169
What is in this?

36:28.260 --> 36:30.728
Vodka, Scotch, Kahla,

36:31.430 --> 36:32.476
and...

36:32.560 --> 36:35.973
and just enough of anything
the parents won't notice is missing!

36:36.230 --> 36:38.357
It's kind of like
when you run your soda cup

36:38.440 --> 36:40.237
under the fountain drinks
at the Crestmont,

36:40.320 --> 36:42.447
just, you know, with liquor.

36:43.070 --> 36:45.777
Yeah, my friend Kat and I
used to call it a suicide.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.440
I can't imagine why.

36:48.950 --> 36:50.747
[Hannah]
So, yeah,

36:50.830 --> 36:52.741
we kind of lost track of the plan.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.786
Okay. Your turn.

36:56.630 --> 36:58.666
I dare you to...

36:59.750 --> 37:01.001
take another drink.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.928
But it was so nice having a new friend.

37:11.310 --> 37:12.299
Bonng!

37:13.140 --> 37:14.596
Well, I don't know.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.721
Okay, your turn.
I dare you to take off your bra.

37:19.650 --> 37:21.606
Under your shirt. Relax.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.985
[laughing]

37:37.250 --> 37:38.319
Okay.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.042
I dare you to take off your shirt.

37:44.090 --> 37:45.500
[laughing]

37:50.810 --> 37:53.552
Um... I dare you to kiss me.

37:53.680 --> 37:54.726
Yeah, right.

37:56.810 --> 37:57.970
-Seriously?
-Come on.

37:58.060 --> 37:59.220
Doesn't mean anything.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.435
Come on. Here, I'll close my eyes.

38:10.950 --> 38:13.282
[giggles echoing]

38:13.750 --> 38:15.115
[Mrs. Baker] Everything okay?

38:18.710 --> 38:22.248
Sorry, I just got turned around
on my way back from...

38:24.960 --> 38:26.370
This is Hannah's room?

38:29.760 --> 38:30.749
Yes.

38:38.770 --> 38:39.805
It is.

38:46.360 --> 38:47.816
But you knew that already.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.229
I what?

38:49.320 --> 38:50.696
I knew you looked familiar.

38:50.780 --> 38:53.112
I saw you standing outside that window.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.206
I was just, uh...

38:57.290 --> 38:59.531
No, it's okay. I'm not angry.
But, um...

39:00.500 --> 39:01.626
[stammers]

39:04.630 --> 39:05.949
Maybe we could help each other.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.716
You must have questions.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.177
It's actually...
It's getting late, Mrs. Baker.

39:12.260 --> 39:14.091
No, no, no. Please, Clay.

39:15.350 --> 39:17.227
I'm just trying to piece things together.

39:17.310 --> 39:18.299
You don't need--

39:18.390 --> 39:19.880
My parents are expecting me home.

39:19.980 --> 39:21.265
No, we...

39:23.980 --> 39:25.060
We never got a note.

39:29.740 --> 39:31.276
We never got a reason.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.485
So now my daughter

39:33.580 --> 39:36.037
might as well be
an acquaintance to me, too.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.033
I have some of her things,
some of her photos,

39:40.120 --> 39:42.031
and, um, her notes.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.450
We could look at them together.

39:44.540 --> 39:46.792
Wait... wait here?

39:56.810 --> 39:57.845
[girls giggling]

40:03.270 --> 40:06.478
[Hannah]
It’s hard to say exactly
how things turned but...

40:09.110 --> 40:12.318
let’s just say.. . that night;

40:12.410 --> 40:14.059
things escalated quick/y.

40:17.910 --> 40:19.821
[camera clicking]

40:21.080 --> 40:23.822
Wh/le Courtney o’r'dn ’t hear
my stalker arrive. . .

Idid.

40:25.380 --> 40:26.335
[clicking continues]

40:26.420 --> 40:29.753
Thankfully, I found a way
to krl/ two birds with one stone.

40:31.510 --> 40:32.750
Wait.

40:34.010 --> 40:34.999
Who are you?

40:36.970 --> 40:38.176
Tyler?

40:43.480 --> 40:44.799
Tyler Down?

40:45.900 --> 40:49.688
Oh, my God, you said it was
some creepy guy from down the street!

40:49.780 --> 40:50.895
I thought it was.

40:53.820 --> 40:55.401
Uh, I should...

40:57.080 --> 40:58.650
-Wait.
-I should go.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.151
What? No. Courtney.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.569
Courtney, wait.

41:06.290 --> 41:07.120
Come back.

41:19.510 --> 41:20.807
Wait.

41:21.100 --> 41:23.056
Please, I just want to talk.

41:23.140 --> 41:24.880
I'm sorry, my mom's waiting for me.

41:24.980 --> 41:25.890
I'm sorry.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.574
[Hannah]
Remember when I said you wou/dn ’t
believe the skeletons Tyler found?

41:41.950 --> 41:43.360
Turns out they weren ’t mine.

41:45.290 --> 41:46.325
Hey.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.785
They were Courtney’s.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.706
-Everything okay?
-Everything's great.

41:49.790 --> 41:53.169
Um, I'm sorry I left last night.
I just wasn't feeling well.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.289
Okay.

41:57.180 --> 41:58.966
Should we at least talk about it?

42:00.640 --> 42:02.016
There's nothing to talk about.

42:02.430 --> 42:03.465
Okay.

42:04.640 --> 42:08.053
Listen, I'm going to get
those pictures from Tyler, so...

42:08.400 --> 42:09.389
don't worry about that.

42:09.480 --> 42:10.640
Yeah, okay. Good.

42:11.230 --> 42:12.436
Good. You should.

42:21.450 --> 42:22.439
Is this all of them?

42:23.040 --> 42:23.859
Yeah.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.036
Um, Hannah, wait.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.376
Um...

42:30.000 --> 42:32.628
Would you ever want to hang out?

42:34.420 --> 42:35.546
You...

42:35.630 --> 42:37.257
want to hang out with me?

42:42.470 --> 42:44.711
[door opens, closes]

42:44.810 --> 42:46.721
[Hannah]
I guess we all have secrets.

42:47.270 --> 42:48.259
[locker closes]

42:48.350 --> 42:50.511
And nobody l/kes it
when their secret gets out.

42:53.610 --> 42:54.770
What did you do?

42:54.860 --> 42:56.100
Whoa, what's wrong?

43:03.120 --> 43:05.156
No, I talked to Tyler this morning.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.868
-He told me he got rid of all of them.
-Well, he lied.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.996
Group-texted half the school.

43:11.750 --> 43:14.082
Okay, look, calm down.
No one can tell that's us.

43:14.170 --> 43:15.831
You don't think they'll figure it out?

43:15.920 --> 43:18.332
I shouldn't even be seen
talking to you right now.

43:18.630 --> 43:21.337
-Because of a stupid picture?
-Come on, Hannah.

43:21.470 --> 43:25.349
You of all people should know what
a picture can do to a person's life.

43:27.060 --> 43:28.425
Me of all people?

43:29.060 --> 43:29.879
I told you--

43:29.980 --> 43:31.516
Just stay away from me, okay?

43:31.600 --> 43:32.646
Courtney.

43:43.450 --> 43:44.610
[Hannah]
Funny thing is,

43:44.700 --> 43:46.440
no one ever found out it was us.

43:48.750 --> 43:51.287
That whole fall,
everyone looked at that picture.

43:52.460 --> 43:54.416
I ’d imagine some boys more than once.

43:57.130 --> 43:58.700
But no one ever knew who it was.

44:11.890 --> 44:13.141
[knocking at door]

44:13.230 --> 44:14.891
Well, now you know.

44:14.980 --> 44:16.015
[knocking continues]

44:16.110 --> 44:16.929
[door opens]

44:18.320 --> 44:20.390
So, just, a...

44:20.700 --> 44:23.442
gentle reminder about closed doors.

44:24.070 --> 44:26.231
Sorry. Old habits. I'll work on it.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.036
Your mother has dinner ready.

44:28.540 --> 44:29.859
And a special surprise.

44:29.950 --> 44:31.656
Yeah. Be right down.

44:37.130 --> 44:39.792
[Hannah]
t/ke I said
we ’re a society of stalkers.

44:41.630 --> 44:42.619
We ’re all gu/lty.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.794
We all look.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.636
We all think things we ’re ashamed of

44:55.980 --> 44:57.641
The only diﬁ'erence is, Tyler...

44:58.610 --> 44:59.599
[phone chimes]

44:59.690 --> 45:00.736
. . . you got caught.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.171
Guys, I have to go out after dinner, okay?

45:30.260 --> 45:31.261
Won't be long.

45:31.350 --> 45:32.339
Where you going?

45:33.350 --> 45:34.385
What are you doing here?

45:34.480 --> 45:35.890
Your mom invited me.

45:35.980 --> 45:37.299
There you are!

45:37.400 --> 45:39.891
I ran into Tony's dad at school today.

45:39.980 --> 45:42.858
I haven't seen Tony in so long,
I thought, invite him to dinner.

45:51.700 --> 45:53.611
[Mrs. Jensen]
You have three older brothers?

45:53.700 --> 45:55.952
God, I only had one,
and we fought constantly.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.826
Though, to be fair, he's an asshole.

45:58.670 --> 45:59.659
Matt!

45:59.750 --> 46:02.378
Well, we actually get along pretty well.

46:02.510 --> 46:03.545
Really?

46:04.510 --> 46:06.546
I feel I saw you guys fighting recently.

46:07.640 --> 46:08.834
Well, that's true.

46:09.430 --> 46:12.467
We're not afraid of confrontation,
but at the end of the day,

46:12.560 --> 46:15.051
we always know whose side we're on.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.300
How's that history project going?

46:20.230 --> 46:21.857
With the cassettes.

46:23.190 --> 46:24.600
That's a good question.

46:24.690 --> 46:26.191
How are things going, Clay?

46:28.240 --> 46:29.229
I, uh...

46:30.450 --> 46:31.940
I think I'm done, actually.

46:32.870 --> 46:33.859
Oh, yeah?

46:34.700 --> 46:36.327
-A| ready?
-Yeah.

46:36.410 --> 46:37.661
I think I'm just gonna...

46:38.790 --> 46:41.031
pass the project on to the next student.

46:41.210 --> 46:42.620
Sounds very collaborative.

46:43.590 --> 46:47.299
A colleague of mine is studying
collaborative learning theory.

46:47.380 --> 46:48.369
[door bell rings]

46:48.470 --> 46:50.131
It actually strengthens your synapses.

46:50.760 --> 46:51.966
Wow.

46:52.050 --> 46:53.051
[Clay] Um...

46:53.680 --> 46:54.886
Yeah, it's...

46:55.220 --> 46:57.381
-It's like our oral history is...
-Trick or treat!

46:57.600 --> 46:59.761
passed down through the generations.
That kind of thing.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.891
Fantastic. It's the oral tradition.

47:01.980 --> 47:04.608
Except if we don't finish our part first,

47:04.690 --> 47:06.317
we could fail the whole assignment.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.389
Right?

47:08.700 --> 47:10.019
We could.

47:10.110 --> 47:11.361
But I doubt it.

47:11.450 --> 47:14.078
I would hate for us to have
to face those repercussmns.

47:14.830 --> 47:16.240
Maybe we won't.

47:16.660 --> 47:18.457
Maybe those repercussions
aren't even real.

47:20.080 --> 47:22.878
As your project partner,
I would highly recommend that we--

47:23.000 --> 47:23.989
Are you...

47:24.460 --> 47:25.586
my partner?

47:27.630 --> 47:31.214
The assignment was very clear what
would happen if we broke the rules.

47:31.340 --> 47:33.547
The assignment was given by a dead person.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.010
In history.

47:39.770 --> 47:42.432
The historical figure is dead, obviously.

47:43.730 --> 47:45.186
Sure, sure.

47:46.070 --> 47:49.233
In a sense, all our assignments
are given by dead people.

47:51.780 --> 47:52.610
Hmm?

47:54.160 --> 47:57.197
I mean, we came here to get away
from the fucking Walplexes...

47:58.910 --> 48:00.457
and... and now,

48:00.540 --> 48:03.327
they've not only followed us, but...

48:04.920 --> 48:06.876
but they're stealing our customers.

48:07.670 --> 48:10.969
Walplex isn't the reason
why people aren't coming in, Andy.

48:12.130 --> 48:13.506
They're scared of us.

48:14.970 --> 48:16.346
They can't face us.

48:17.140 --> 48:18.767
What can we do about that?

48:21.390 --> 48:22.596
We could fight.

48:24.440 --> 48:26.977
[sighs] You know, take on the monolith.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.233
We've got those pictures
from the bathroom that you took.

48:30.320 --> 48:32.060
We have that list.

48:32.150 --> 48:33.560
And if that's not enough,

48:33.660 --> 48:35.867
we're just gonna have to find
something else,

48:35.950 --> 48:39.579
because we have to let them know
this is not a senseless tragedy,

48:39.660 --> 48:43.039
that there are reasons why this happened.

48:58.930 --> 49:00.716
That our little girl has a face.

49:03.520 --> 49:04.555
And a name.

49:08.820 --> 49:09.809
Okay.

49:11.610 --> 49:12.599
Okay.

49:28.630 --> 49:30.120
That guy you saw last night.

49:30.590 --> 49:32.046
He messed with my sister.

49:32.840 --> 49:34.546
Me and my brothers took care of it.

49:34.680 --> 49:35.795
Messed with...

49:36.640 --> 49:38.039
You should call the police.

49:38.470 --> 49:40.927
The police in my neighborhood
are a little different than yours.

49:41.850 --> 49:44.432
Sometimes when there's no justice,
you make it for yourself.

49:46.310 --> 49:47.516
Don't go to Bryce's.

49:47.770 --> 49:49.055
Don't listen to Marcus.

49:49.150 --> 49:50.811
Just... don't do it.

49:52.690 --> 49:53.736
Why not?

49:54.490 --> 49:55.639
It's not what Hannah wanted.

49:57.660 --> 49:59.480
How do you know what Hannah wanted?

49:59.870 --> 50:00.985
Hey, how do you even...

50:01.580 --> 50:03.571
_ Marcus told me
he just passed the tapes on.

50:03.660 --> 50:06.037
-Marcus lied.
-How do you know?

50:06.870 --> 50:09.282
There probably isn't even
a second set of tapes.

50:09.380 --> 50:10.995
It's probably all bullshit.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.706
[engine starts]

50:17.890 --> 50:19.630
[recording]
Hey, it’s Hannah.

50:20.390 --> 50:21.425
Hannah Baker.

50:22.470 --> 50:24.472
Thatis right. Don ’t adjust your. . .

50:24.680 --> 50:26.807
whatever device you ’re hearing this on.

50:26.890 --> 50:27.970
It’s me,

50:28.060 --> 50:29.687
live and in stereo.

50:36.490 --> 50:37.605
[Hannah]
Thing is. . .

50:38.110 --> 50:40.112
even though Tyler stopped coming around...

50:41.410 --> 50:43.321
I never stopped feeling afraid.

50:43.830 --> 50:45.070
So what could I do after that?

50:46.460 --> 50:48.360
First the school, then my house. ..

50:48.460 --> 50:49.996
even my own bedroom.

50:51.420 --> 50:52.535
Nowhere was safe.

50:54.090 --> 50:56.046
You took all that away.

51:02.050 --> 51:04.177
[sputtering]

51:08.100 --> 51:10.728
You guys have any idea how much
shit I'm in with Jessica?

51:10.900 --> 51:12.891
-Where the fuck is he?
-He'll be here.

51:13.940 --> 51:16.238
If he doesn't show,
we're done making friends.

51:16.320 --> 51:17.435
We do it my way.

51:17.530 --> 51:19.942
-What is your way, exactly?
-We make him understand.

51:20.030 --> 51:22.271
-[door bell buzzes]
-Yeah, understand what?

51:23.660 --> 51:24.649
Candy's in the bowl.

51:24.740 --> 51:25.866
[man]
You got a delivery.

51:36.130 --> 51:37.711
Holy shit, is that them?

51:52.060 --> 51:55.188
-The fuck! Those are for my dad!
-Uh...

51:56.400 --> 51:58.527
Dude! I must be, like,

51:58.610 --> 52:00.066
really stoned or something.

52:06.830 --> 52:08.866
Okay, we should not be
doing this at his house.

52:08.950 --> 52:10.326
Really? Should we do it at yours?

52:10.410 --> 52:12.492
-He's going to find out.
-Maybe he should.

52:12.620 --> 52:13.700
Maybe that's how this ends.

52:13.790 --> 52:14.779
No.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.199
This ends with Clay.

52:16.300 --> 52:17.699
Whatever we have to do, okay?

52:18.300 --> 52:19.506
You're freaking me out.

52:19.590 --> 52:21.330
Maybe you're too fucking stoned, huh?

52:24.640 --> 52:26.380
[Hannah]
You made me paranoia; Tyler.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.589
So now...

52:31.190 --> 52:32.339
I'm giving that to you.

52:35.020 --> 52:38.228
Maybe I'll never know
why you did what you did.

52:41.360 --> 52:44.568
But I can make you understand
how it felt to be me.

52:48.580 --> 52:50.650
That's why I'm outside your window, Tyler.

52:52.330 --> 52:55.072
And after people hear this,
I bet I won't be the only one.

53:27.450 --> 53:28.656
[phone vibrates]

53:43.010 --> 53:44.420
Knock knock, Tyler.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.559

54:11.290 --> 54:12.609
Oh, shit.

54:14.500 --> 54:15.899
Fucking Clay.

54:17.210 --> 54:18.199
You're so done.

54:18.290 --> 54:19.951
You ’re so
fuck/ng
done.

You wanted it; wanted it
