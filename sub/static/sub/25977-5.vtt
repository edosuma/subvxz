WEBVTT

02:19.431 --> 02:22.601
For all your Muslim roots...

02:23.853 --> 02:26.021
we have to...

02:26.063 --> 02:29.483
bring this war...

02:29.525 --> 02:32.570
from our land to their land.

02:36.699 --> 02:40.786
In the name of God...

02:40.828 --> 02:43.205
to all the Muslim people with

02:43.247 --> 02:46.667
all your tribes...

02:46.709 --> 02:49.461
and your beliefs...

06:33.393 --> 06:35.521
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.314
Name?

06:37.356 --> 06:40.025
Hanin Abdullah.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.031
Names and ages of your children?

06:46.073 --> 06:49.743
Rama is 10, Sara is 14 and...

06:49.785 --> 06:52.371
Is there someone else?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.372
My son.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.414
Where is he?

06:54.456 --> 06:55.582
He's not with me.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.334
I had to leave him.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.378
But I'm going to find
a way to get him back,

06:59.419 --> 07:00.379
once we're settled.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.632
Where do you intend to go?

07:03.674 --> 07:05.759
We're trying to get to Europe.

07:05.801 --> 07:08.178
Hold still.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.975
Only place you're going
is back to Syria.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.394
Please! Our lives
are in danger...

07:15.435 --> 07:19.731
Turkey can't accept
any more refugees.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.358
Especially after Paris.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.528
Paris? What do you mean?

07:28.365 --> 07:31.952
Here's your tent assignment.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.162
Let's go.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.873
Next!

07:58.312 --> 08:02.316
I ask you to return
to your homes...

08:02.357 --> 08:06.069
all my brothers and sisters.

08:06.111 --> 08:10.240
Come back to your senses.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.826
Come back to your homes.

09:33.115 --> 09:37.911
Sheikh, Dudayev and the men
await your orders.

09:37.953 --> 09:40.497
My orders are the same...

09:40.539 --> 09:45.043
as they were yesterday,
nothing has changed.

09:45.085 --> 09:49.423
They'll meet and travel south
into Italy together.

09:49.464 --> 09:53.218
It's just...
they're getting anxious.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.303
The longer--

09:54.344 --> 09:56.847
We will wait for my brother.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.432
Understood?

10:06.815 --> 10:09.901
Any news about
my wife and daughters?

10:09.943 --> 10:13.113
Yazid hasn't checked in.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.249
Brother!

10:26.626 --> 10:28.879
Come here.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.679
You're one of Al-Radwan's men.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.891
I was, Sheikh Suleiman.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.809
But I'm honored to be with you.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.646
When was the last time
you put on clean clothes?

10:48.899 --> 10:51.568
This is all I have.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.658
There's water here... to wash
your clothes and yourself.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.162
What's your name?

11:02.204 --> 11:03.789
Ismail.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.415
Where are you from?

11:07.084 --> 11:09.127
Tunis, my Sheikh.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.630
Listen to me, Ismail from Tunis.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.467
Being poor can
rob you of many things.

11:15.509 --> 11:21.348
But it must never
take away your self-respect.

11:21.390 --> 11:26.520
If you don't respect yourself,
no one else will respect you.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.313
Go and bathe.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.482
Get this man some of my clothes.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.900
Yes, sir.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.611
Thank you.
May God bless you, Sheikh.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.988
God be with you.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.986
Michel?

12:17.154 --> 12:20.031
Mousa Suleiman.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.992
We interned at
Credit Suisse together.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.034
Mousa.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.333
Best foot forward, right?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.560
Thank you.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.520
No, please keep it.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.739
Am I saying that right?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.616
Mousa.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.330
Mousa.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.748
Come with me, please.

13:12.709 --> 13:17.714
I see you published a paper
on digital banking...

13:17.756 --> 13:20.467
and its effect
on the global economy.

13:20.509 --> 13:21.760
That's correct.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.386
Tell us about that.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.681
In a global economy,

13:26.723 --> 13:28.391
the bankers of tomorrow

13:28.433 --> 13:32.270
must be agile and quick.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.857
Digital banking

13:35.899 --> 13:38.109
and electronic transactions

13:38.151 --> 13:39.986
are the future of banking.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.781
My paper explored the many ways

13:42.822 --> 13:46.117
technology will effectively
disrupt this industry.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.119
A bank such as yours...

13:48.161 --> 13:50.747
could be on the forefront
of this disruption

13:50.789 --> 13:56.211
and gain
tremendous market share.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.715
Instead of trying
to change a system,

14:00.757 --> 14:02.968
I'd encourage you to operate
within its parameters.

14:04.803 --> 14:07.305
Relationships and trust...

14:07.347 --> 14:09.558
are the currency with which
we've operated on

14:09.599 --> 14:11.476
for over 260 years.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.686
If you please--

14:12.727 --> 14:16.314
That kind of trust
cannot be built over a computer.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.021
Guys,

17:43.062 --> 17:44.439
come

17:44.481 --> 17:45.982
look!

17:54.240 --> 17:56.451
God is great.

17:56.493 --> 18:00.079
In the Alps, they're still
searching for the terrorist...

18:03.082 --> 18:05.210
who attacked a church in Paris.

18:05.251 --> 18:08.004
Parisians are still in shock...

20:34.484 --> 20:37.236
Ouch! You don't do it like Mom.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.948
It's done, you're fine.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.449
One minute.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.371
Press it.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.875
Yes, my love.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.128
Are you going to find
my mother and sisters?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.838
Sure, I'm going to find them,

20:55.880 --> 20:57.715
don't worry.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.384
He's here, my Sheikh.

21:03.429 --> 21:08.434
Samir, go eat your lunch.
All of it.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.313
Hey, Babon!

23:29.200 --> 23:31.327
You know it was some shooting!

23:33.162 --> 23:34.664
You're under arrest, bitch!

23:36.666 --> 23:39.377
One of these days,
I'm gonna cap your ass.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.170
I'm gonna break your heads in!

23:41.212 --> 23:43.381
Bust their heads with what?

23:43.422 --> 23:45.716
With what?

23:45.758 --> 23:47.510
OK, laugh, laugh.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.014
With this.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.476
Let me see.

23:55.518 --> 23:56.519
Stop, man!

23:56.561 --> 23:57.812
Who gave it to you?

23:57.854 --> 24:00.064
Halim.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.274
Motherfucker!

24:01.315 --> 24:02.692
Why'd he give you
something like that?

24:02.733 --> 24:04.110
This is not a toy!

24:04.152 --> 24:06.028
You don't know anything,

24:06.070 --> 24:08.197
stick with selling falafel.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.748
Didn't you used to
come here to draw?

24:19.917 --> 24:22.879
You ever thought about
picking it up again?

24:25.882 --> 24:28.342
Like what,
drawing pictures of tourists?

24:29.594 --> 24:32.722
What do I need money for?

24:32.763 --> 24:36.225
You're the one who's
gonna get us out of here.

24:37.977 --> 24:42.231
You should see the way they look
at me in these interviews.

24:42.273 --> 24:48.738
When they see me,
hear my name and where I live.

24:48.779 --> 24:53.743
It's over before I even
sit down. Sons of bitches.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.959
You have to think positive.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.420
You have to will it
into existence.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.593
How much of that shit
have you been smoking?

25:12.345 --> 25:14.597
Your future is
going to be great,

25:14.639 --> 25:16.432
you just have to believe it.

25:16.474 --> 25:19.894
And if it doesn't, I'm fucked.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.480
There's no way I'm putting on
an apron and selling falafel.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.482
I still have my pride.

25:31.906 --> 25:35.076
Stand up.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.828
Stand up and keep your hands
where I can see them.

25:37.870 --> 25:38.871
Come on!

25:40.456 --> 25:42.708
You smell that?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.043
What is that?

25:44.085 --> 25:46.212
Incense?

25:49.173 --> 25:51.425
This belong to you?

25:51.467 --> 25:54.262
What was that? You want to say
something to me, tough guy?

25:54.303 --> 25:56.639
No, he doesn't.

25:56.681 --> 25:58.975
No one's talking to you,
asshole.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.434
Okay, arms raised.

26:00.476 --> 26:01.435
Raise your arms!

26:01.477 --> 26:03.479
Come on!

26:03.521 --> 26:05.398
What's going on here?

26:12.154 --> 26:14.115
Go fuck yourself!

26:14.156 --> 26:15.157
Leave him alone!

26:17.702 --> 26:18.744
Gun!

26:24.417 --> 26:25.751
Run!

30:43.425 --> 30:46.178
-Hello.
-Hello.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.346
Is Mr. Sadik here?

30:47.388 --> 30:48.722
Come in.

30:48.764 --> 30:49.765
Thank you.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.771
Mr. Sadik?

30:55.813 --> 30:58.065
Oh... hello.

30:58.107 --> 31:00.234
Hello.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.990
Did someone send you here?

31:06.031 --> 31:08.200
Yes. A man in
my neighboring tent... Rifaat.

31:08.242 --> 31:10.202
He told me
I should speak to you.

31:10.244 --> 31:11.870
Sit down.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.247
Thank you.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.670
Stinks out there, eh?

31:25.467 --> 31:29.847
I heard a pipe burst.

31:29.888 --> 31:30.931
Please.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.891
We want to go to Europe.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.352
The journey is very hard.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.146
Very dangerous.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.814
And it's going to cost you.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.275
How much do you want?

31:41.317 --> 31:43.986
How much do you have?

31:50.576 --> 31:53.621
I'm sorry...

31:54.913 --> 31:57.499
It's all I have, I swear!

31:57.541 --> 31:59.251
This?

31:59.293 --> 32:01.503
Maybe for just one of you.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.384
No, no, please.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.219
I have two small daughters.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.931
I can't help you now.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.934
But once you have more money...

32:15.976 --> 32:17.227
come back.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.234
Peace be upon you.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.485
Come here, you.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.701
How are you?

33:22.251 --> 33:24.169
What?

33:25.421 --> 33:27.464
You don't like my new look?

33:29.633 --> 33:31.510
What did they do to you?

33:34.763 --> 33:37.266
Nobody did anything to me.

33:40.728 --> 33:44.773
The whole story is,
I've met some people here.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.651
And thank God.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.778
God helped me.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.282
What the fuck
are you talking about?

33:58.579 --> 34:01.498
Ever since our parents died,

34:03.542 --> 34:06.879
I've never felt like
I belonged anywhere.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.589
Until now.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.055
In prison?

34:20.309 --> 34:22.519
My body is in prison, yes.

34:26.106 --> 34:29.818
This is the first time I felt
that my mind and soul...

34:29.860 --> 34:31.153
are free.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.491
I want every Muslim

34:35.532 --> 34:39.703
to feel that sense of belonging
that I feel.

34:41.663 --> 34:47.628
God has put me on a path
to realize that.

34:50.088 --> 34:53.717
And he's going
to show me the way.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.177
Time's up.

34:58.555 --> 35:00.724
I promise you...

35:00.766 --> 35:04.102
everything will be different
when I get out.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.855
Peace be with you.

35:08.065 --> 35:10.275
No, brother.

35:10.317 --> 35:14.613
Not if she's been
with you first.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.725
You ready?

39:11.767 --> 39:13.393
In position.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.008
Be careful.

39:46.635 --> 39:48.303
Slowly.

39:54.476 --> 39:55.560
Sheikh.

39:58.522 --> 39:59.898
Ali?

41:18.977 --> 41:21.062
Just a minute.

41:21.104 --> 41:25.358
How do we know it's him?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.986
Who else would know
to contact us this way?

41:28.028 --> 41:30.447
You saw the news...

41:30.488 --> 41:33.366
the French police are after him.

41:33.408 --> 41:34.409
We have to be sure.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.038
What are you doing?

41:38.079 --> 41:41.041
Back-tracing the IP address.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.556
Chamonix, France.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.313
Is it correct?

44:02.515 --> 44:04.142
We have to close.

44:04.184 --> 44:06.519
Wait a minute.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.273
Talk to your boss.

46:15.315 --> 46:16.900
I took care of everything.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.776
Everything is fine.

46:24.491 --> 46:25.783
Let's go, let's go!

46:42.884 --> 46:44.552
The woman and the two girls?

46:44.594 --> 46:46.012
Where are they?
