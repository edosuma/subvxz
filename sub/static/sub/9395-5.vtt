02:05.949 --> 02:07.653
Hey, lets move it lady.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.199
Come on!

02:26.501 --> 02:27.237
Haley.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.794
- How long are we going to do this?
- Do what?

02:31.257 --> 02:34.268
- Avoid each other.
- You tell me. You’re the one upset.

02:34.401 --> 02:35.655
And you’re the one who lied to me.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.596
I don’t know what to say to you, Luke.

02:38.230 --> 02:41.666
Just explain to me why you were with Nathan. Huh?

02:42.117 --> 02:44.267
I mean, considering the past few weeks and what he’s done…

02:44.733 --> 02:45.594
I can’t.

02:47.094 --> 02:48.865
You know how I feel about him, Haley.

02:49.178 --> 02:50.846
Lucas, fine!

02:52.091 --> 02:55.967
Yes. I know how you feel about him. But there is something you don’t know.

02:57.502 --> 02:59.862
I promised him I’d tutor him if he left you alone.

03:01.444 --> 03:02.192
What?

03:02.895 --> 03:04.337
I’m doing it for you, Luke.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.375
- So you and Peyton are history?
- Nah.

04:22.417 --> 04:24.646
- I wouldn’t count on that.
- No?

04:25.086 --> 04:28.153
Yeah. This is what she does. She freaks out, we break up;

04:28.526 --> 04:29.950
a few days later, we make up.

04:33.668 --> 04:34.881
So why put up with that?

04:35.736 --> 04:37.400
Because a few days later, we make up.

04:38.179 --> 04:39.177
Hey, ball.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.498
Expect plenty more of that at the father/son game because we’re going to crush you guys.

04:46.574 --> 04:47.215
Oh yeah?

04:51.736 --> 04:53.175
You can expect more of that.

04:53.779 --> 04:54.476
Bring it on.

05:05.090 --> 05:05.980
I’m an idiot.

05:07.691 --> 05:08.842
I know.

05:09.555 --> 05:10.542
I’m sorry.

05:12.428 --> 05:13.974
I miss hanging out with you, Hales.

05:15.177 --> 05:16.923
Yeah. I miss hanging out with you too.

05:17.977 --> 05:21.280
Listen. I appreciate everything you did for me.

05:21.985 --> 05:26.051
I do, Haley, but- how about you let me handle the team from now on, okay?

05:28.106 --> 05:28.862
Okay.

05:29.625 --> 05:33.603
All right. So you can… stop tutoring Nathan now.

05:35.038 --> 05:37.306
Um, no. I can’t.

05:37.715 --> 05:40.792
- Haley.
- Lucas. I can’t. I promised him.

05:40.858 --> 05:45.006
If I break that promise, I’m just as bad as... you think he is.

05:50.110 --> 05:52.941
Hey, Lucas, I’m looking forward to see you play in the father/son game this year.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.780
Good article about you and your pop.

06:04.662 --> 06:07.605
Who would’ve known that Dan Scott’s basketball pedigree would be inherited

06:07.646 --> 06:11.031
by his two sons, Nathan Scott and Lucas?

06:12.808 --> 06:14.145
You’ve got to be kidding me.

06:14.349 --> 06:17.222
That’s great, Dad. We’re all one big happy family now.

06:17.959 --> 06:21.840
Watch it. I wonder what they’re paying this reporter to support his crack habit?

06:21.926 --> 06:25.009
- How about some breakfast?
- I lost my appetite.

06:26.448 --> 06:30.067
Dan, the boy exists. He’s on the team. It’s not exactly headline news.

06:30.148 --> 06:31.686
No, Deb, apparently it is.

06:32.346 --> 06:34.589
Well, how do you think Lucas and Karen feel about it?

06:34.676 --> 06:37.562
Gosh, I don’t know. Maybe we should invite them over for breakfast and find out.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.643
Alright, look. If you guys are going to argue, I’m out of here.

06:39.704 --> 06:42.324
We’re not arguing and your breakfast is getting cold.

06:42.392 --> 06:44.864
I’m just going to grab something at school with my brother.

06:48.127 --> 06:53.066
You know, there is a chance that Lucas and Nathan can get along if their father encouraged it.

06:53.245 --> 06:57.434
True. But there’s also a chance that hell can freeze over.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.118
You’re not still mad at me, are you?

07:06.835 --> 07:07.869
I’m not mad.

07:09.174 --> 07:10.106
We’re just over.

07:16.896 --> 07:19.425
Hey cutie. I saw your picture in the paper.

07:19.962 --> 07:22.016
Personally, I didn’t think it did you justice.

07:22.507 --> 07:23.874
- No?
- No.

07:25.057 --> 07:26.307
Far too much clothing.

07:48.439 --> 07:52.491
Hey, Lucas. That father verses son game’s coming up.

07:52.654 --> 07:53.933
Considered who you want to play with.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.923
- I figured I’d skip it.
- Oh, come on, son.

07:57.974 --> 08:00.965
I know it’s hard, but it will be worse if you don’t play.

08:01.758 --> 08:05.495
Besides, I thought you said you were through hiding from Dan.

08:05.925 --> 08:06.743
I am.

08:07.743 --> 08:09.658
Well, wouldn’t it be fun to dunk on him?

08:14.204 --> 08:18.014
Here we go! Ravens, lets score!

08:18.080 --> 08:19.867
Wait! Hold on, Peyton, you’ve got the arms wrong.

08:19.985 --> 08:23.323
- It’s not brain surgery, Brooke.
- Okay, what’s with the attitude?

08:23.645 --> 08:24.880
What’s with your life?

08:25.140 --> 08:28.285
Seriously, aren’t you embarrassed that the most important thing in your world is some stupid cheer?

08:28.381 --> 08:31.091
Look, I’m really sorry things didn’t work out with you and Nathan,

08:31.151 --> 08:34.438
- but don’t go all Mariah on me, okay?
- You think this is about Nathan?

08:34.758 --> 08:37.956
You’re not even close! You’re not even in the neighborhood of close!

08:38.018 --> 08:40.761
- Okay, then, what’s wrong?
- What’s wrong is how… pointless all of this is.

08:40.850 --> 08:43.046
- Stop saying that!
- No! Because it’s true.

08:43.366 --> 08:47.515
What difference does it make if you sleep with a popular guy, or you go to the right party,

08:47.572 --> 08:52.047
or you know the moves to some moronic cheer to do with some lame-ass game I could care less about!

09:07.027 --> 09:10.888
- Hey. You’re not working today.
- Yeah, I have a favor to ask.

09:10.965 --> 09:14.933
Uh, there’s this father/son charity basketball game.

09:15.025 --> 09:18.635
Whitey says I’ve got to play, so… you interested?

09:19.735 --> 09:21.932
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:22.020 --> 09:25.987
Yeah, okay. Of course, I might be, you know, a little out of shape,

09:26.909 --> 09:30.631
not to mention I… wasn’t worth a crap back in high school.

09:30.754 --> 09:32.162
Well, it’s better for us, right?

09:32.751 --> 09:34.553
Well. Why don’t you start coming to the court with us?

09:34.717 --> 09:37.800
Hang with a member of the Scott basketball dynasty?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.471
So how are you doing with that?

09:42.080 --> 09:43.299
Well. What are you going to do?

09:44.133 --> 09:46.560
- Sucks for my mom…
- Yeah. What about you?

09:47.164 --> 09:51.409
Honestly… I can’t stand being connected to Nathan or Dan.

09:52.402 --> 09:53.595
Hey, big brother!

09:54.147 --> 09:56.563
I was getting some cardio in, ran out of water. You wanna help me out?

09:57.302 --> 09:58.536
Yeah. Sure, why not?

09:59.186 --> 10:03.615
So, uh, you wanna buy some charity tickets to the big father/son game?

10:04.218 --> 10:06.646
Oh, well, I, you know, could if I wasn’t playing in it.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.309
Luke invited me.

10:09.683 --> 10:10.655
Oh, great.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.127
Well, try not to soil the Scott family name while you’re at it.

10:14.290 --> 10:16.235
Yeah… that’s every day advice for you, huh?

10:18.238 --> 10:19.098
Hey, kid.

10:20.623 --> 10:22.892
Seems as though you have an obligation to the family name too.

10:23.379 --> 10:24.207
Don’t blow it.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.854
That article’s a lie.

10:27.576 --> 10:29.338
You’re not my father and you never were.

10:30.086 --> 10:31.887
You’re right. It is a lie.

10:32.788 --> 10:34.979
You should never have had the name in the first place.

10:35.497 --> 10:37.282
Hey! Dan!

10:42.982 --> 10:45.988
- You okay?
- Look! I have no responsibility to him or his name.

10:46.064 --> 10:49.116
Just… Don’t let him get inside your head, okay?

10:49.404 --> 10:51.451
You know what. I don’t plan on it. You know, as a matter of fact,

10:51.625 --> 10:55.101
I think it’s about time I get out from under this guy completely.

10:55.521 --> 10:56.675
What’s that supposed to mean?

10:57.176 --> 10:58.973
Meaning I’m not gonna be a Scott anymore.

11:00.848 --> 11:02.757
I’m gonna change my last name.

11:17.641 --> 11:21.951
You’re late. I expected you this morning after that article in the paper.

11:22.321 --> 11:24.823
I understand Lucas has asked Keith to play in the basketball game.

11:25.592 --> 11:27.512
- Do you think that’s wise?
- Why not?

11:28.745 --> 11:30.844
Well, Keith isn’t exactly a father.

11:31.398 --> 11:34.915
You’re not the best father, either, Danny, and you’re playing.

11:35.145 --> 11:36.098
What about Lucas?

11:36.723 --> 11:38.634
You have to know this will be embarrassing for him.

11:38.837 --> 11:39.937
Embarrassing for him?

11:40.726 --> 11:42.856
What about embarrassing for you?

11:44.014 --> 11:44.883
Wait a minute.

11:46.141 --> 11:48.145
This isn’t about Lucas and Keith.

11:49.088 --> 11:50.849
This is all about you, Danny…

11:51.694 --> 11:56.869
and that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you see the son that you…

11:57.505 --> 11:58.800
never claimed.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.194
You were a great player.

12:03.413 --> 12:05.585
Maybe the best I ever had.

12:06.850 --> 12:10.099
But you can score a hundred points in this game,

12:10.659 --> 12:13.045
and that feeling’s not going to go away.

12:14.176 --> 12:19.086
It’ll be there until you acknowledge that Lucas is your son

12:19.557 --> 12:21.175
and that you made a mistake.

12:31.748 --> 12:34.297
You uncle Keith’s been working hard getting ready for the game.

12:36.796 --> 12:40.160
He mentioned that you’re thinking of changing your last name?

12:41.071 --> 12:44.805
I just don’t want people to read these stupid articles and think I played ball just because Dan did.

12:46.448 --> 12:48.695
I don’t want you to have to read that stuff.

12:50.016 --> 12:52.014
Well, you’re in the spotlight now.

12:53.012 --> 12:54.808
The article’s come with the territory.

12:55.592 --> 12:57.292
But I don’t want you to run away from that.

12:59.027 --> 13:01.106
I’d rather you face your problems head on.

13:01.397 --> 13:05.197
I just… figured it would make you happy if I took your name.

13:10.036 --> 13:15.110
When I found out I was pregnant, Dan already had a basketball scholarship

13:15.171 --> 13:17.260
and nothing was going to get in the way of that.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.033
But then something strange happened.

13:22.078 --> 13:25.198
Right before classes started, Dan changed his mind.

13:25.611 --> 13:28.641
He said he’d finish the semester and… we’d get married.

13:30.141 --> 13:34.111
So when I went into labor and you appeared,

13:35.002 --> 13:38.098
the nurse asked for your name and I said it was Scott.

13:40.051 --> 13:41.396
Keith was there,

13:42.532 --> 13:45.431
and when the nurse brought you in she let him hold you.

13:46.783 --> 13:49.225
I’ve known Keith my whole life,

13:50.675 --> 13:53.296
and that’s the only time I’ve seen him cry.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.446
Your father never showed up.

14:00.264 --> 14:01.451
So to hell with him.

14:02.516 --> 14:03.684
I don’t want his name.

14:04.866 --> 14:06.798
Keith’s a Scott too, you know.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.256
I’ve never been ashamed of you, Lucas, not for a second. Or your name.

14:12.812 --> 14:16.198
Then I also never had to carry that name in this town the way you have,

14:16.274 --> 14:19.378
so if you want to change it, you have my blessing.

14:20.473 --> 14:22.116
But it’s just a name, Luke.

14:22.976 --> 14:25.019
What you do with it is up to you.

14:35.506 --> 14:36.197
Brooke!

14:37.287 --> 14:38.956
Hey. Have you heard from Peyton?

14:39.463 --> 14:42.770
Not since you two broke up and she went psycho on me in practice. Why?

14:43.241 --> 14:44.455
Because she’s not in school.

14:44.906 --> 14:46.791
And she won’t pick up at home or on her cell.

14:47.379 --> 14:49.765
Well… maybe she’s out kicking the homeless.

15:00.368 --> 15:02.534
A lot of smokers in this place.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.593
I don’t really smoke.

15:05.134 --> 15:08.477
I just figured since Nathan and I broke up, I’ve got room for a new bad habit.

15:09.896 --> 15:11.315
Mind if I sit down?

15:19.860 --> 15:22.824
She was quite a gal, your mother.

15:23.710 --> 15:24.581
Yeah.

15:25.052 --> 15:27.940
She used to lead cheers for my team, too.

15:31.115 --> 15:32.968
And you’ve got her looks.

15:34.739 --> 15:37.723
- I don’t really remember her.
- Oh, I do.

15:37.822 --> 15:41.778
She was a wily one. Your old man didn’t stand a chance.

15:46.453 --> 15:49.060
So what are you doing here? Making a reservation?

15:49.786 --> 15:51.416
You better watch it!

15:52.296 --> 15:53.053
No.

15:55.133 --> 15:58.015
No. My wife, Camilla, is buried out here.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.876
Right over behind those trees.

16:03.089 --> 16:07.108
I couldn’t get in a word edgewise while she was alive so I come out here

16:07.780 --> 16:11.957
and visit, tell her about things.

16:12.868 --> 16:14.209
You think she’s listening?

16:15.489 --> 16:18.946
Yeah. I know she’s listening.

16:21.531 --> 16:29.226
I lost my wife just about the time your mother passed away.

16:31.402 --> 16:34.362
That always make us weak and tough one.

16:35.514 --> 16:36.620
They’re all tough.

16:38.033 --> 16:38.878
Yeah.

16:43.886 --> 16:47.342
The good news is you did better… and the bad news is better is a D.

16:47.828 --> 16:50.127
Yeah. I guess I didn’t really give this one my best shot.

16:50.721 --> 16:51.939
What’s going on with you?

16:52.195 --> 16:53.926
Well. You know me and Peyton broke up.

16:54.136 --> 16:56.783
- Peyton and I.
- Oh. She broke up with you too?

16:59.280 --> 17:02.236
Just… I didn’t know she was going to take it this hard.

17:02.876 --> 17:04.667
She went off on Brooke at practice.

17:05.808 --> 17:07.325
I’m kinda worried about her.

17:07.518 --> 17:09.904
Well, maybe you should’ve worried more about her when you were together.

17:10.416 --> 17:12.454
- I’m sorry, but come on, it’s true.
- No!

17:12.634 --> 17:14.498
You don’t know the first thing about Peyton and I.

17:17.342 --> 17:19.315
- Me and Peyton.
- Whatever.

17:34.312 --> 17:35.367
Why do you do this?

17:40.708 --> 17:42.695
If I were you, I’d get back out now.

17:43.150 --> 17:44.814
Not until you tell me what’s going on.

17:52.361 --> 17:54.234
Come on! Slow down, Peyton! Come on!

17:55.268 --> 17:56.574
Slow the car down!

17:58.899 --> 18:01.301
Peyton? Slow the car down.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.182
She was driving to school to pick me up.

18:04.804 --> 18:08.038
She was late, so she ran a red light.

18:11.167 --> 18:14.096
It was one light at the wrong split second and it ended for her.

18:24.055 --> 18:26.189
My mom ran one red light.

18:27.992 --> 18:30.432
I run them all the time and nothing happens.

18:32.901 --> 18:34.120
It’s not fair.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.046
No it’s not.

18:39.088 --> 18:40.357
You can get out now.

18:41.727 --> 18:43.228
Or I can stay if you want.

18:45.113 --> 18:47.627
No. You can’t.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.716
- Hey, Keith.
- Hey.

19:11.808 --> 19:13.919
Twice in a week. It’s got to be some kind of record.

19:14.087 --> 19:16.165
Yeah, well, it’s this father/son thing.

19:16.897 --> 19:20.054
- Yeah. How about a frostie?
- Nope, I’m in training.

19:23.151 --> 19:26.795
- It’s just a game, Dan.
- No. It’s a public event.

19:27.379 --> 19:30.507
I mean, what are people gonna think? Especially after that article?

19:30.655 --> 19:32.243
Oh yeah. About that…

19:33.037 --> 19:35.960
what in the hell is wrong with you telling Lucas he never deserved the name Scott?

19:36.646 --> 19:38.990
- Well, he doesn’t.
- The hell he doesn’t.

19:39.523 --> 19:41.905
- You fathered him, Dan.
- That’s right.

19:42.320 --> 19:46.773
Which brings me to my original point. What do you think you’re doing playing in the basketball game?

19:46.819 --> 19:50.711
I mean, whatever you think you are to Karen and her son, you’re not a husband. Or a father.

19:52.043 --> 19:53.830
How much does a suit like that cost?

19:55.646 --> 19:59.824
Because it’s gonna look like hell when I lay you out all over that greasy floor.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.963
- Come on, big brother.
- That’s right. Big brother.

20:03.047 --> 20:05.595
And no matter what you did on that basketball court a lifetime ago,

20:05.672 --> 20:08.308
and no matter what you do now, I’ll always be your big brother.

20:08.662 --> 20:12.718
So guess what, Danny boy? It was my name first. It’s Lucas’ name now.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.502
And there’s nothing you can do about it.

20:16.828 --> 20:18.037
Okay, Keith.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.674
You know, you can be ashamed of me.

20:21.559 --> 20:23.121
And you can be ashamed of Lucas.

20:24.232 --> 20:30.197
But what makes YOU think we’re not just as ashamed of you? Huh?

20:31.253 --> 20:32.491
Now get out of my shop.

20:48.474 --> 20:49.480
Hi.

20:52.613 --> 20:57.015
You never know who you’re going to see in the boys’ locker room these days.

20:57.410 --> 20:58.542
Or what you’ll see.

20:59.909 --> 21:01.307
I thought maybe we could talk.

21:01.829 --> 21:03.186
Unless… you’re too busy.

21:04.082 --> 21:05.505
No, sure. We can talk.

21:07.256 --> 21:08.413
Still in denial?

21:10.083 --> 21:10.866
About what?

21:11.593 --> 21:12.586
Missing her.

21:14.153 --> 21:15.453
It’s okay that you do.

21:16.897 --> 21:18.501
What… are you my tutor or my shrink?

21:19.238 --> 21:20.421
Whatever you need.

21:23.611 --> 21:25.802
I treated Peyton pretty bad.

21:26.446 --> 21:28.120
She had every right to walk away.

21:30.096 --> 21:33.404
Okay, yeah, it was my fault. I screwed up.

21:35.012 --> 21:36.646
I just wish I had another chance.

21:40.337 --> 21:41.187
Nice work.

21:42.593 --> 21:47.264
- That was the truth.
- No. On your practice exam. 81.

21:50.408 --> 21:51.427
You know, it’s funny.

21:52.804 --> 21:56.005
I think we’ve actually talked more than Peyton and I ever did.

21:56.972 --> 21:59.363
Peyton and I… good job.

21:59.655 --> 22:01.273
Yeah, you too.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.264
Hey… are you coming to the game?

22:04.170 --> 22:07.293
Um, well, it depends on how you do on your English exam.

22:07.519 --> 22:10.858
Anything less than an 81, I’m staying home and watching The Office.

22:10.996 --> 22:11.718
Alright.

22:12.650 --> 22:13.529
Haley?

22:14.299 --> 22:15.021
Yeah?

22:15.758 --> 22:17.493
I know this hasn’t been easy for you.

22:18.549 --> 22:20.729
I just wanted to say thanks.

22:22.820 --> 22:23.832
Good luck.

22:32.170 --> 22:35.548
My wife wouldn’t let me smoke in the house, so...

22:35.733 --> 22:38.277
I got in the habit of coming up here to this bridge.

22:39.230 --> 22:42.410
I’d offer you one, but I know you’re trying to cut down.

22:44.339 --> 22:46.797
- How long have you been coaching?
- Too long.

22:47.996 --> 22:50.448
- Do you ever wonder about it?
- What?

22:51.007 --> 22:53.664
I mean, you’ve spent your whole life watching boy’s play a game.

22:55.680 --> 22:59.525
Well, I’d prefer to think I was teaching them to play.

23:01.333 --> 23:07.861
Yeah, sometimes I think about the conversations when I’m finished between me and my wife.

23:08.583 --> 23:11.676
The holidays I missed because I was off coaching somewhere.

23:12.914 --> 23:16.073
That’s when I come closest to thinking it was a mistake.

23:19.386 --> 23:21.536
- Do you miss her?
- Every day.

23:24.624 --> 23:28.485
Peyton, it’s hard to lose somebody.

23:30.522 --> 23:35.115
I spent a lot of time searching for reasons or answers.

23:36.052 --> 23:38.366
But you can’t find what’s not there.

23:39.165 --> 23:40.485
It just happened.

23:42.348 --> 23:44.531
So you gonna light that thing or what?

23:44.930 --> 23:52.283
No. I used to love cigars but I haven’t smoked one since I lost Camilla.

23:53.142 --> 23:55.007
I don’t even carry matches anymore.

23:57.884 --> 24:00.100
I don’t guess I’ve been much help to you.

24:00.879 --> 24:02.488
But I do know one thing.

24:03.741 --> 24:05.728
Your mother’s proud of you.

24:07.653 --> 24:09.164
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

24:18.759 --> 24:20.611
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:23.606 --> 24:25.456
I really don’t want to be like this, Luke.

24:25.695 --> 24:26.515
What is that?

24:27.396 --> 24:31.533
This. Us skirting around each other. I mean, we’re friends.

24:32.573 --> 24:35.445
You know, when you wanted to join the team,

24:36.090 --> 24:39.510
I didn’t understand it and I told you that, but I supported you.

24:40.084 --> 24:43.202
- I know.
- So… support me!

24:44.030 --> 24:46.262
When I’m tutoring someone, and they get it,

24:46.493 --> 24:50.933
and that light goes on, I feel good! I feel worthy.

24:51.025 --> 24:53.487
The same way that you feel when you play basketball.

24:54.522 --> 24:56.636
Besides, having things gotten better for you?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.909
The team’s left you alone, the hazing’s stopped?

25:00.667 --> 25:04.516
Yeah. So, that’s worth the risk for me.

25:05.314 --> 25:07.389
What’s not worth the risk it us.

25:07.609 --> 25:10.409
We’re friends and that is important to me.

25:12.104 --> 25:13.502
You’re just tutoring him?

25:13.747 --> 25:18.222
I am just tutoring him. That’s it.

25:18.995 --> 25:19.907
Okay.

25:29.907 --> 25:32.421
- Oh, game.
- I think I pulled a kidney.

25:33.889 --> 25:35.902
- You alright?
- Yeah.

25:38.749 --> 25:39.655
Yeah…

25:43.092 --> 25:45.907
So you decide on the name thing yet?

25:46.613 --> 25:51.041
Well, I downloaded the forms. But, uh… Mom’s still got to sign off on them.

25:51.877 --> 25:53.243
Mind if I tell you what I think?

25:54.389 --> 25:55.410
I think you just did.

25:56.710 --> 26:00.980
Hey, I know I’m not your father, and, I’d never try to tell you what to do, but…

26:02.655 --> 26:05.871
I just… wish you’d think about it.

26:07.837 --> 26:08.732
I will…

26:10.432 --> 26:12.485
and you know you don’t have to play if you don’t want to.

26:13.222 --> 26:14.411
Oh. Why do you say that?

26:15.629 --> 26:18.976
I know it puts you in a weird spot.

26:19.274 --> 26:21.507
And Dan and Nathan are your family too, right?

26:23.002 --> 26:26.641
As far as I’m concerned, you and your mom are my family.

26:26.836 --> 26:27.973
As long as you’ll have me.

26:29.289 --> 26:34.737
You know, Dan and I, we... we’ve never seen eye to eye. Even when we were kids.

26:34.802 --> 26:37.726
And Nathan’s practically a stranger.

26:39.416 --> 26:40.482
Besides,

26:41.240 --> 26:45.053
I was honored that you asked me to play.

26:46.190 --> 26:47.152
Good.

26:48.325 --> 26:49.912
I was hoping you’d say that.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.164
Listen. I’ve got to take off.

26:55.140 --> 26:55.832
Talk to you later?

26:56.865 --> 26:57.531
Si.

26:58.800 --> 26:59.819
Take care, all right.

27:01.233 --> 27:02.830
- Hey, Keith?
- Yeah.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.902
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

27:16.503 --> 27:17.286
How’s my boy?

27:18.475 --> 27:19.160
Why?

27:20.303 --> 27:22.596
Dad send you to spy on me? Where’s my drink?

27:30.860 --> 27:33.491
You know, you’d think he organized this entire thing himself.

27:33.794 --> 27:35.376
Just so he could get back on the court.

27:37.464 --> 27:40.256
I know he’s been tough on you lately, Nate.

27:40.348 --> 27:43.772
But I want you to know things are going to change around here.

27:44.366 --> 27:46.082
I just wish he’d lay off, you know.

27:47.531 --> 27:48.606
I wanna do good for him.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.919
He just gets so worked up about this stuff.

27:52.625 --> 27:55.836
Well, if you don’t want to play, don’t play.

27:56.932 --> 27:58.319
He’ll get over it.

28:00.244 --> 28:01.770
You know that’s a lie, Mom.

28:12.605 --> 28:13.285
Hey.

28:16.090 --> 28:17.310
I’ve been thinking about you.

28:18.491 --> 28:19.822
Try a cold shower.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.615
Sorry. You set yourself up for that one.

28:25.502 --> 28:26.484
Yeah, I guess so.

28:28.317 --> 28:29.182
How you doing?

28:29.948 --> 28:31.363
Lets see.

28:32.011 --> 28:35.587
I broke up with my boyfriend. My mom’s dead.

28:36.228 --> 28:38.778
And my dad’s away on a job.

28:39.837 --> 28:40.841
What’s your dad do?

28:41.395 --> 28:43.273
Captains a drudging boat.

28:44.261 --> 28:49.478
He’s only here for those forked anniversaries but this year, he sent his sympathies in an email.

28:51.455 --> 28:52.667
I read your article.

28:53.837 --> 28:57.199
I think it seemed like you guys are just one great, big, happy family.

28:57.286 --> 28:58.510
Yeah. It’s kind of ironic, huh?

28:59.432 --> 29:03.652
You know, I would gladly erase my dad if it would bring back your mom.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.331
I wish I could change it for you.

29:10.353 --> 29:11.453
Thank you.

29:14.776 --> 29:16.313
I gotta go.

29:18.274 --> 29:19.046
Hey, Peyton!

29:20.686 --> 29:21.877
Don’t ruin it, okay?

29:32.974 --> 29:34.556
Excited about your game tomorrow?

29:34.980 --> 29:38.374
Truthfully? It’s like Christmas Eve.

29:40.603 --> 29:44.401
And have you been naughty… or nice?

29:44.719 --> 29:48.216
Have I been naughty? Well, which would you prefer?

29:53.147 --> 30:00.064
Honey. I know this is important to you and I know that Nathan is talented but…

30:01.277 --> 30:03.694
I think you push him too hard sometimes.

30:05.059 --> 30:08.477
I worry that he won’t enjoy it anymore.

30:09.049 --> 30:12.757
Oh, he enjoys it. If he doesn’t, he’ll regret it when it’s gone.

30:13.571 --> 30:14.431
Do you?

30:15.531 --> 30:16.280
Every day.

30:18.798 --> 30:20.277
There’s nothing like it, Deb.

30:21.307 --> 30:24.466
Walking into the arena, hearing the cheers of a sellout crowd,

30:24.841 --> 30:26.545
knowing it’s going to be your night.

30:28.255 --> 30:31.184
And for an hour or two, the world is yours

30:32.008 --> 30:34.179
and there’s nothing they can do to stop it.

30:36.089 --> 30:38.858
I wish I would’ve known you then. I wish you could’ve been there.

30:39.693 --> 30:43.943
No decisions to make, cars to sell, bills to pay.

30:45.300 --> 30:46.415
Just the game.

30:48.265 --> 30:49.652
And I was good.

30:54.875 --> 30:56.800
It’s the best it ever was for me.

30:59.012 --> 31:00.615
Better than your life now?

31:01.623 --> 31:04.464
Better than... knowing your son?

31:05.310 --> 31:06.349
Or me?

31:10.256 --> 31:11.464
It was different.

31:24.688 --> 31:25.800
What do you call that?

31:26.609 --> 31:27.591
Love.

31:30.237 --> 31:31.390
What do you want, Nathan?

31:33.501 --> 31:34.801
It’s what I don’t want.

31:37.418 --> 31:38.871
I don’t want this for us.

31:39.389 --> 31:41.217
Maybe you should’ve thought of that sooner.

31:42.553 --> 31:43.617
Yeah, I know.

31:46.056 --> 31:48.496
I’ve been thinking about how we were when we started going out.

31:50.427 --> 31:52.087
Like that day at Rhysfield Beach.

31:53.027 --> 31:54.513
The nights here in your room.

31:55.625 --> 31:57.892
We haven’t been that way in a long time.

31:58.538 --> 31:59.500
We could be.

32:01.622 --> 32:05.167
Come on, Peyton. I’ve been thinking about you.

32:06.089 --> 32:07.773
I know you’ve been thinking about me.

32:09.832 --> 32:11.712
I’ve actually had a lot going on lately.

32:13.272 --> 32:14.460
Yeah, me too.

32:15.075 --> 32:18.814
My dad’s been going crazy about this father/son game and my mom…

32:19.382 --> 32:21.757
it’s like ever since she came back she’s been wanting to hang out.

32:21.813 --> 32:23.579
I really can’t hear this right now.

32:26.574 --> 32:30.076
Alright. Well, how about you come to the game?

32:30.829 --> 32:32.406
Maybe we could hang out afterwards.

32:42.119 --> 32:43.430
I miss you, Peyton.

32:46.437 --> 32:47.613
I’ll see you there.

33:05.631 --> 33:06.839
Catch up to you later man.

33:07.939 --> 33:10.321
- Got a sec?
- Hey, yeah, what’s up?

33:11.273 --> 33:12.193
Check that out.

33:12.753 --> 33:15.538
An 84! That’s so great.

33:16.962 --> 33:18.851
Yeah, hey, congratulations!

33:35.511 --> 33:39.101
Hey! Dan the man, are you going to carry us tonight or what?

33:39.192 --> 33:42.393
You know it, Bruce. I’ll carry the team and Keith can carry my jock.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.547
- Keith, it’s good to see you man.
- You too, Bruce.

33:48.730 --> 33:51.189
I didn’t know you had a son that played ball too.

33:52.736 --> 33:54.195
Well, actually I’m just a stand-in.

33:55.023 --> 33:56.975
One of the boys doesn’t have a father.

34:04.636 --> 34:06.862
Luke! Lucas!

34:07.727 --> 34:09.226
Hey, Scott!

34:17.204 --> 34:18.719
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

34:18.827 --> 34:22.811
And welcome to the Tree Hill Ravens’ father and son charity basketball game.

34:23.016 --> 34:27.065
Tonight the fathers battle the sons and the winner gets bragging rights.

34:28.534 --> 34:33.619
Coming soon tonight, Ravens son league MVP Nathan Scott.

34:34.434 --> 34:37.976
And for the father’s, the all-time even scorer in the history of Tree Hill,

34:38.059 --> 34:43.562
and state championship runnerup, put your hands together for Dan Scott!

34:50.511 --> 34:52.855
Sounds like the old man got a louder applause than you did.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.657
Are you sure your hearing aid’s not turned up too loud?

35:20.385 --> 35:23.540
Under a minute remaining now and the Ravens’ sons are putting on a show.

35:23.683 --> 35:25.785
They’ve made a mockery out of this one.

35:25.823 --> 35:28.270
28 point lead and they’re running it in on the fathers…

35:31.884 --> 35:35.562
Lucas Scott spins the ball on his finger… over to Hamilton…

35:39.308 --> 35:44.512
- Hamilton disgraces his father.
- Don’t try that crap with me, Nate.

35:49.488 --> 35:53.491
Nathan Scott tries… scores and is left with an even 30 points at halftime.

35:56.906 --> 35:59.154
You guys suck out there. It’s embarrassing.

35:59.452 --> 36:00.444
For you, maybe.

36:01.192 --> 36:05.868
Come on… you play house with a girl I get pregnant in high school and I’m supposed to be embarrassed?

36:06.660 --> 36:09.539
It’s embarrassing because we’re old men, Dan, playing horribly

36:09.620 --> 36:12.252
- and that’s the way it’s supposed to be.
- Not for me.

36:18.191 --> 36:20.648
- Enemy approaching.
- That’s right, enemy approaching.

36:20.740 --> 36:22.179
Are you going to bring your best game or what?

36:22.886 --> 36:25.691
- You’re down by thirty, Dad.
- No, I’m talking to you.

36:26.052 --> 36:28.385
You bring your best game, I’ll bring mine, and then we’ll see.

36:29.064 --> 36:31.165
- We’ll see what?
- We’ll see who’s the best.

36:31.359 --> 36:32.927
Or maybe you’d rather not know.

36:33.525 --> 36:37.183
- Hey. Come on, relax, little brother.
- This isn’t your place, Keith.

36:37.406 --> 36:40.310
Well, it’s not your place either, Dan.

36:40.913 --> 36:44.145
It’s their game now. We should be proud they’re so good.

36:44.257 --> 36:46.064
Like you had anything to do with it.

36:49.603 --> 36:51.006
You walk away, Danny.

36:54.227 --> 36:55.439
Lets see what you got.

37:01.634 --> 37:03.585
Any of you give me your best game and...

37:04.594 --> 37:05.791
I’m gonna hurt you.

37:08.430 --> 37:09.882
Hey, you’re doing fine.

38:03.173 --> 38:09.014
- Lucas. Luke. Are you mad at me? What’s going on?
- I don’t want to talk about it right now.

38:09.291 --> 38:11.179
Okay, can you just tell me what I did, please?

38:11.652 --> 38:14.206
- I saw you with him.
- Who Nathan?

38:14.718 --> 38:17.928
God, he got a good grade on that math quiz. It was nothing.

38:18.257 --> 38:19.971
I want to believe you, Haley. I do.

38:20.713 --> 38:25.741
- But I don’t think you’re telling the truth.
- I’m am telling the truth Lucas. There’s nothing going on.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.340
Nice bracelet.

38:37.523 --> 38:41.092
Well folks, an impressive showing for Dan Scott. The kids are just too much.

38:41.173 --> 38:42.781
What do you say we make this interesting?

38:43.007 --> 38:46.917
Lets make the score 0-0, and the next basket wins.

38:47.077 --> 38:48.228
Alright. Give me the ball.

38:48.468 --> 38:51.839
Alright. Lets go, fellas. Ravens on three. One, two, three! Ravens.

39:00.930 --> 39:03.743
The Ravens’ sons have the ball, and the next basket wins.

39:04.366 --> 39:05.345
Game over, Dad.

39:08.284 --> 39:12.549
Nathan Scott to the tape. He catches the ball in the wing. He rides to the- holy crap!

39:13.348 --> 39:15.043
Lets hope the young man’s okay.

39:21.851 --> 39:22.922
You okay?

39:24.718 --> 39:26.393
I couldn’t give you the winning bucket, Nathan.

39:35.937 --> 39:38.031
- Beat them?
- Yeah.

39:38.538 --> 39:40.084
But I want to do it myself.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.289
Well, good news, folks. Nathan seems to be okay.

39:44.390 --> 39:46.536
And the Ravens sons still have a crack at it…

39:47.974 --> 39:49.915
Lucas Scott hands the ball to Nathan.

39:51.334 --> 39:54.375
He drives- ooh! He drops the ball. It’s moving.

39:54.528 --> 39:57.799
That will create a turnover. The fathers have a crack at it.

39:58.158 --> 40:00.354
Looks like its payback time.

40:03.519 --> 40:05.398
That was a sloppy turnover, Nathan. That’s not like you.

40:05.460 --> 40:08.173
- That’s because it was on purpose.
- On purpose? Why?

40:08.251 --> 40:09.898
Because you don’t deserve my best game, Dad.

40:10.580 --> 40:14.178
Look. I could’ve beat you. You know it and I know it.

40:14.256 --> 40:17.389
You know, if you want to mess with that, go ahead. I’ll give it to you.

40:31.992 --> 40:33.389
You didn’t beat me, Dad.

40:34.081 --> 40:35.308
You never will.

40:50.403 --> 40:51.126
Good game.

40:52.160 --> 40:55.374
What? Are you kidding me? I was by far the worst one out there.

40:55.635 --> 40:58.318
And that includes old Mr. Budieres and his wooden leg.

40:59.455 --> 41:01.441
Oh, Keith, you know it’s never about basketball.

41:03.864 --> 41:05.037
And just so you know…

41:05.804 --> 41:07.033
what you did for Nathan,

41:08.298 --> 41:10.484
what you’ve done for me…

41:12.906 --> 41:15.988
well, lets just say I was proud to have you as my dad for the night.

41:19.019 --> 41:24.073
You know, I’ve been thinking about what you said about the Scott name, and...

41:25.612 --> 41:30.616
I think I’ll keep it. I just hope I can wear it as well as you.

41:31.548 --> 41:32.516
Thanks.

41:43.482 --> 41:44.219
Hey.

41:49.519 --> 41:50.502
I’m glad you came.

41:51.849 --> 41:52.742
I knew you would.

41:57.164 --> 41:59.166
I want you to know thing’s are going to be different for us.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.674
Did you know that my mom died tonight?

42:02.217 --> 42:03.660
Seven years ago?

42:06.596 --> 42:08.919
You didn’t know because you never asked.

42:11.366 --> 42:13.036
I didn’t come here for you tonight.

42:14.551 --> 42:15.749
Why’d you come?

42:48.400 --> 42:50.248
John Steinbeck once wrote

42:51.401 --> 42:55.421
“It seems to me that if you or I must choose

42:55.475 --> 42:57.554
between two courses of thought or action,

42:58.972 --> 43:00.606
we should remember our dying

43:01.164 --> 43:02.582
and try so to live

43:04.137 --> 43:07.144
that our death brings no pleasure on the world."
