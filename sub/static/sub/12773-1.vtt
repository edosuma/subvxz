Mm-mm.

Okay.

Yeah.

Yeah, I hear it's
beautiful, too.

No, I don't want

I just, I want to

01:24.095 --> 01:25.595

01:25.597 --> 01:27.764
Okay, no,

obviously.

01:29.201 --> 01:32.769

bound to happen.

01:35.974 --> 01:38.374
I think that
the least likely scenario

01:38.376 --> 01:40.810
is that you are never going
to have to beast out again.

01:40.812 --> 01:43.813
I will if they screw up
our room service again.

01:45.684 --> 01:46.883

Do you understand?

I know, but we can't ignore
this, it's big.

04:40.712 --> 04:41.859
It's a blogger.

04:41.860 --> 04:44.060

a celebrity blogger,

04:44.062 --> 04:46.496

to have proof.

04:47.932 --> 04:49.599
all the exposure threats
from last year

04:49.601 --> 04:50.833
and somehow pieced it together?

04:50.835 --> 04:52.268
I already told you,

04:52.270 --> 04:53.469
Homeland Security
covered all those tracks.

04:53.471 --> 04:54.871
Mainstream tracks, maybe,

04:54.873 --> 04:56.139
but not digital tracks,

04:56.141 --> 04:57.807

this guy Duncan's done,

10:16.478 --> 10:18.679
maulings,
vigilante stuff.

10:18.681 --> 10:20.581
And since his blog is
starting to gain traction

10:20.583 --> 10:23.617
with the fringe crowd, we've got
to stop him before it goes wide.

10:23.619 --> 10:25.419
Okay.

10:25.421 --> 10:27.054
I mean, why not?

10:27.056 --> 10:28.889
It's been a little slow since
the last big showdown and all.

10:28.891 --> 10:30.257
So, yeah, I'm game.
Okay.

10:30.259 --> 10:32.025
So what do we do,
how do we stop this?

10:32.027 --> 10:33.160
We have to discredit
him somehow,

10:33.162 --> 10:34.595
make people lose faith in him.

10:34.597 --> 10:36.196
How? He's not making
any of this stuff up.

10:36.198 --> 10:37.331
I know, but we have to make

10:37.333 --> 10:38.832
his fan base think that he is

10:38.834 --> 10:40.834
Okay, so hack into his computer,
corrupt his files?

10:40.836 --> 10:42.636
No, that'll just only confirm

10:42.638 --> 10:44.504
that somebody's
trying to stop him

10:44.506 --> 10:45.873
and fan the conspiracy flames.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.975
We have to control
the messaging somehow.

10:47.977 --> 10:49.376
I know.

10:49.378 --> 10:50.878
We have to get
to his computer

10:50.880 --> 10:52.546
and send out
the disinformation from there

10:52.548 --> 10:53.914
to make it look legit.

10:53.916 --> 10:56.283
Fine, but how?

10:56.285 --> 11:00.754
Well, uh... like, maybe
a little breaking and entering?

11:00.756 --> 11:02.990
But we've done
so much worse.

11:09.965 --> 11:11.932
Come on.

11:11.934 --> 11:13.433
Oh.

11:13.435 --> 11:14.735
(gasps)

11:14.737 --> 11:16.637
Shh.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.607
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

11:20.609 --> 11:23.076
It was your idea.

11:23.078 --> 11:24.444
I know.

11:24.446 --> 11:26.113
But maybe it
wasn't a good one.

11:29.385 --> 11:31.218
Well, this doesn't
look right.

11:31.220 --> 11:32.219
Why?

11:32.221 --> 11:33.553
What do you mean?

11:33.555 --> 11:36.957
Well, you know, it's nicely
decorated and classy.

11:36.959 --> 11:39.393
It's not really
what I expected from a blogger.

11:39.395 --> 11:42.229
What'd you expect, wall-to-wall
computers and video games?

11:42.231 --> 11:44.431
Yeah.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.303
MAN:
Who the hell are you?

11:49.305 --> 11:50.604
Oh. Oh, uh...

11:50.606 --> 11:52.606
(clears throat)
Uh, sorry, sorry.

11:52.608 --> 11:54.608
(JT stammers)

11:54.610 --> 11:56.310
We must be in the
wrong apartment.

11:56.312 --> 11:57.878
Uh, is this 3C?

11:57.880 --> 11:59.279
3B.

11:59.281 --> 12:01.515
Oh.
(laughs) 3B.

12:01.517 --> 12:04.284
Uh, No-no wonder it
didn't look familiar.

12:04.286 --> 12:05.552
Come on, honey, let's
get out of here.

12:05.554 --> 12:06.687
Ah, my bad.

12:06.689 --> 12:08.355
Honey, let's go. Um...

12:08.357 --> 12:10.190
(whispering):
JT.

12:14.363 --> 12:16.596
I'm going to ask one more time.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.966
Who are you?

12:18.968 --> 12:21.001
Uh...

12:21.003 --> 12:22.703
Nobody really.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.474
(screaming)

12:29.778 --> 12:31.044
Oh.

12:31.046 --> 12:32.679
Run, hurry!

12:33.916 --> 12:35.482
(screams)

12:40.689 --> 12:43.223
(indistinct chatter)

12:52.568 --> 12:54.568
Heather. Heather?

12:54.570 --> 12:55.836
H...

12:55.838 --> 12:57.104
Heather!

12:58.507 --> 12:59.706
Heather!

13:03.045 --> 13:05.479
(Vincent clears his throat)

13:05.481 --> 13:07.447
Well, at least we finally
got out of the hotel room.

13:07.449 --> 13:09.349
And nearly got exposed.
But I didn't.

13:09.351 --> 13:10.684
Yeah, but you almost did.

13:10.686 --> 13:12.486
What do you want
me to do, nothing?

13:12.488 --> 13:14.187
No, of course not,
that's not the point.

13:14.189 --> 13:15.822
Okay, then what
is the point?

13:15.824 --> 13:17.824
Really? We're gonna
have our first fight

13:17.826 --> 13:19.226
as a married couple
on our honeymoon?

13:19.228 --> 13:21.228
Sorry.

13:21.230 --> 13:23.597
That's just our new
reality, that's all.

13:23.599 --> 13:26.600
We're so used to worrying
about being exposed

13:26.602 --> 13:30.437
by somebody who's after you,
but this, this is different.

13:30.439 --> 13:32.839
This is our future.

13:32.841 --> 13:35.742
Even doing the right
thing is a threat.

13:35.744 --> 13:37.544
There are cameras
everywhere.

13:39.515 --> 13:41.515
Come on, what
choice do we have?

13:41.517 --> 13:44.818
Neither one of us is the kind
of person not to get involved.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.286
And that is not
about to change

13:46.288 --> 13:47.754
just because we got
married, right?

13:47.756 --> 13:49.756
Yeah, I don't want
to change it, I don't.

13:49.758 --> 13:52.592
But you have to admit
that the consequences

13:52.594 --> 13:54.067
of being exposed
are pretty huge.

13:54.068 --> 13:55.783
We have never got
caught, have we?

13:55.807 --> 13:56.564
No, but...

13:56.565 --> 13:59.433
No, and we are not
about to either.

13:59.435 --> 14:01.068
You want to know why?

14:01.070 --> 14:02.402
Hmm?

14:02.404 --> 14:04.504
Tell me.
Because...

14:04.506 --> 14:09.409
we have gone through so much
just to get to this point.

14:09.411 --> 14:12.079
That we've overcome
so many obstacles,

14:12.081 --> 14:15.315
more than any other couple
could possibly...

14:15.317 --> 14:17.851
ever handle--
that's why...

14:17.853 --> 14:20.420
we have made it.

14:20.422 --> 14:23.323
(chuckles)

14:23.325 --> 14:25.525
We got nothing
to worry about.

14:25.527 --> 14:27.761
(phone ringing)

14:27.763 --> 14:29.429
Mm.

14:31.066 --> 14:33.166
JT, is everything all right?

14:33.168 --> 14:35.168
No. Sorry, it's not.

14:35.170 --> 14:38.105
Heather's hurt, and I'm pretty
sure Vincent's in trouble.

14:39.341 --> 14:42.809
Let me guess-- honeymoon's over.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.220
Are you all right?

14:50.222 --> 14:53.090
Tess. Hey.
Are you hurt?

14:53.092 --> 14:54.925
No, I... I don't think so.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.827
And Heather's
gonna be okay, too.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.262
Thank God.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.563
(chuckles):
Yeah. No kidding.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.898
(thump)
Ow.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.132
What the hell were you thinking?

15:02.134 --> 15:04.334
I can explain.
No, you can't, JT.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.404
Forget the fact that you're
guilty of breaking and entering.

15:08.507 --> 15:11.108
Which, by the way, makes you
a possible murder suspect.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.809
You could have
gotten yourself killed.

15:12.811 --> 15:14.444
Heather, too.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.048
You think we expected
to find a killer inside?

15:18.050 --> 15:20.284
And not just any killer,
but an assassin.

15:20.286 --> 15:23.053
You should have seen
what he did to the blogger.

15:23.055 --> 15:24.829
Which, by the way,
proves I was right.

15:24.829 --> 15:25.915
About what?

15:25.939 --> 15:28.758
About what Duncan knew,
or at least thought he knew,

15:28.994 --> 15:31.028
about... beasts.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.730
Why else would the killer

15:33.732 --> 15:35.933
have taken his hard drive
<i>and</i> killed him?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.768
Bloggers piss people off
all the time.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.770
You don't know it
was because of...

15:39.772 --> 15:41.672
the “B” word.
That's what detectives

15:41.674 --> 15:43.106
are for, not professors.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.442
And this is so not us
moving forward, JT,

15:45.444 --> 15:47.577
this is us moving backwards.

15:50.983 --> 15:56.086
You okay?
Uh, yeah, sure...

15:56.088 --> 15:57.120
(chuckles)

15:57.122 --> 15:58.922
How you feeling?

15:58.924 --> 16:00.524
Feeling? Me? Um...

16:00.526 --> 16:01.992
fine.

16:01.994 --> 16:03.660
Good. That's great.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.862
Um...

16:05.864 --> 16:07.197
are you a doctor?

16:07.199 --> 16:08.865
Oh.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.268
(laughs) Uh... sorry,
you probably don't remember it.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.337
I'm the EMT who brought you in.

16:13.339 --> 16:14.938
Oh, you are?
Yeah.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.239
Kyle.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.175
Kyle, it's nice to meet you.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.243
I'm Heather.
I know.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.578
I brought you in.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.213
(both laugh)

16:23.215 --> 16:24.514
Right. (laughs)

16:24.516 --> 16:26.149
Well, Doc says you're
gonna be okay.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.452
No concussions,
no broken bones.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.121
You're lucky-- that
was a pretty bad fall.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.290
Yeah.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.493
You weren't the one
who changed me in-into my...

16:36.495 --> 16:37.527
(laughs)
No.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.196
Okay. (laughs)
Yeah, I-I just

16:39.198 --> 16:40.464
bring the patients in.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.599
Nurses do all
that other fun stuff.

16:42.601 --> 16:43.800
I mean...

16:43.802 --> 16:45.268
I didn't mean it that way.

16:45.270 --> 16:47.070
I-I just...

16:47.072 --> 16:48.171
Anyway,

16:48.173 --> 16:49.539
uh...
(chuckles)

16:49.541 --> 16:52.042
So... what happened
in that apartment?

16:52.044 --> 16:55.312
Did you see who killed that guy?
Oh, um...

16:55.314 --> 16:57.414
you know...
TESS: Hey.

16:57.416 --> 16:58.548
Police business. Out.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.390
Just so we're clear,

17:06.392 --> 17:08.992
Cat would kill you for this,
you know that, right?

17:08.993 --> 17:10.327
Yeah.

17:12.564 --> 17:15.832
(sighs): Look... maybe the
blogger did know about beasts,

17:15.834 --> 17:18.101
which means the killer
does now, too.

17:18.103 --> 17:19.703
All right, now we're talking.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.005
TESS:
Or not. Either way,

17:22.007 --> 17:24.141
it's a police investigation,
do you understand me?

17:24.143 --> 17:27.109
A murder-- which means,
you stay out of it, both of you.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.345
And keep Cat and Vincent

17:28.347 --> 17:29.513
out of it, too.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.381
(sighs)

17:31.383 --> 17:32.549
What?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.185
Um, I already sort
of called them.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.754
TESS:
In Paris on their honeymoon?

17:37.756 --> 17:40.190
Heather got hurt-- what was I
supposed to do, not tell them?

17:41.660 --> 17:43.160
They're already
on their way back.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.028
I don't get it--
it's almost like

17:45.030 --> 17:47.030
you guys miss
all this craziness. Do you?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.565
(chuckles):
No. Of course not.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.767
Of course not.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.570
All right, look,
go to the airport,

17:53.572 --> 17:55.405
turn Cat and Vincent around.
What?!

17:55.407 --> 17:56.606
Yeah?
To France?

17:56.608 --> 17:58.708
How? They're not
gonna want to go back.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.778
Make them. Tell them you
overreacted, jumped the gun.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.947
Tell them Heather's fine.
Just do whatever you have to do

18:03.949 --> 18:07.084
to keep them out of here until
we know exactly what's going on.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.320
I don't need any more beast crap
to cover up.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.991
(sighs)

18:17.262 --> 18:20.564
WOMAN (over P.A.): Last call for Flight 707
to Los Angeles.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.032
CATHERINE:
JT!

18:22.034 --> 18:23.066
What are you doing here?

18:23.068 --> 18:25.735
Hey! Welcome back. Bonjour!

18:25.737 --> 18:27.337
What, you got a cab waiting
for us or something?

18:27.339 --> 18:28.638
A cab? No, uh, listen,

18:28.640 --> 18:30.807
I-I think there's been
some sort of mix-up.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.242
What do you mean?
Okay, can we talk about this

18:32.244 --> 18:33.977
on the way to the hospital?
Yeah.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.345
Actually, no.
Uh, we don't really need

18:35.347 --> 18:37.380
to go to the hospital.
Heather's fine.

18:37.382 --> 18:39.149
She's been released.
She's... on her way home.

18:39.151 --> 18:40.350
Home?
I mean, you know,

18:40.352 --> 18:41.418
to your place.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.153
She's house-sitting, right?

18:43.155 --> 18:45.155
Okay, wait-wait-wait.
Uh, I'm confused.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.791
I thought you said
that she <i>fell</i> three stories.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.526
More like two
and a half.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.294
Couple of bruises,
that's it.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.696
O-Okay, and what
about this blogger?

18:52.698 --> 18:54.498
You said he-he knows
something about me?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.666
Possibly but
maybe not.

18:56.668 --> 18:58.435
I might have jumped
the gun a little.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.836
I apologize-- I-I
shouldn't have called

18:59.838 --> 19:01.671
and ruined your
honeymoon, but...

19:01.673 --> 19:04.374
hey, there's another flight
to Paris in a couple hours,

19:04.376 --> 19:05.842
so, <i>allez, vite!</i>

19:05.844 --> 19:06.843
Wait!

19:06.845 --> 19:08.445
Tess is pissed

19:08.447 --> 19:10.046
that you called us, isn't she?

19:10.048 --> 19:11.181
No.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.183
Yes.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.784
But Heather
really is okay.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.353
I promise.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.054
And... Tess is right--
I shouldn't have dragged her

19:18.056 --> 19:20.757
into this, I shouldn't
have put her in harm's way.

19:20.759 --> 19:22.526
Come on, man, you shouldn't put
yourself into harm's way.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.394
What the hell are you thinking?
I don't know. I mean,

19:24.396 --> 19:26.730
I really thought this blogger
was maybe gonna expose you,

19:26.732 --> 19:29.866
and then he got killed,
then I don't know what's going on.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.301
Maybe Tess is right--
maybe I'm just

19:31.303 --> 19:33.036
used to getting into trouble.
Okay, look,

19:33.038 --> 19:35.405
on the bright side, if it
does turn out to be something,

19:35.407 --> 19:37.174
it'll be a good thing
you called, right?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.809
(groans): Aw, Tess is gonna kill me.
I will

19:39.811 --> 19:42.012
take care of Tess.
You track the killer,

19:42.014 --> 19:44.414
see if you can figure out why
he wanted to kill the blogger so badly.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.783
Love you.
Love you. Mwah!

19:46.785 --> 19:49.819
Uh, b-but what, what
are you gonna tell Tess?

19:51.156 --> 19:53.056
Come on!

19:53.058 --> 19:55.225
(siren wails, chirps)

19:56.562 --> 19:59.596
TESS: What do you mean
he was tortured? How?

19:59.598 --> 20:02.065
Who would do
something like that?

20:02.067 --> 20:03.133
Don't be mad at JT.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.267
We wouldn't leave.

20:04.269 --> 20:05.735
No, it's probably a good thing.

20:05.737 --> 20:06.870
All right, send
me the M.E.'s report,

20:06.872 --> 20:08.038
along with whatever else

20:08.040 --> 20:09.239
was on the blogger's cloud.

20:09.241 --> 20:10.574
I need to know
what the killer has

20:10.576 --> 20:11.775
and what his next move is.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.376
What's going on?

20:13.378 --> 20:15.478
Oh, you know, just people
getting skinned alive,

20:15.480 --> 20:16.913
um, cover-ups,

20:16.915 --> 20:18.582
beast hunters-- I'm screwed.

20:18.584 --> 20:19.749
“Beast hunters”?

20:19.751 --> 20:21.017
Door.

20:23.188 --> 20:25.121
Do you remember
how close Liam came

20:25.123 --> 20:27.023
to exposing Vincent
last year?

20:27.025 --> 20:29.059
You know, dredging up
beastly cold cases?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.995
Yeah, but Agent Russo
had DHS cover that up for us.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.297
Apparently some
conspiracy theory blogger

20:34.299 --> 20:35.665
stayed on the case

20:35.667 --> 20:37.767
and was going to offer up
proof of beasts

20:37.769 --> 20:39.903
this afternoon.
But somebody killed him first?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.005
Yeah, after torturing him
for information.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.674
JT and Heather were lucky
they got out of there alive,

20:44.676 --> 20:46.776
because whoever this killer
is, he's badass.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.378
So, JT was right.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.281
Yes, yes.
Unfortunately.

20:51.283 --> 20:54.217
Oh, Cat, geez.

20:54.219 --> 20:56.753
Really, I really,

20:56.755 --> 20:58.855
I thought we were past all this.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.490
I thought it was over.

21:00.492 --> 21:01.858
Believe me, you're not

21:01.860 --> 21:03.860
the only one surprised
that we're back.

21:03.862 --> 21:05.128
How do we ever move on?

21:05.130 --> 21:06.930
How do we get
back to our normal lives

21:06.932 --> 21:08.832
if we're constantly playing
whack-a-beast all the time?

21:08.834 --> 21:11.001
I don't know,
but we can't stop trying.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.536
Somehow, some way,
there's a way out of this,

21:13.538 --> 21:15.205
I know it.
We just have to find it.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.306
I thought I did.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.941
I thought JT and I did,
you know?

21:17.943 --> 21:19.409
We're supposed
to move in together

21:19.411 --> 21:20.977
like normal people do.

21:20.979 --> 21:24.214
Look, we just have to take this
one step at a time.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.149
If we can find
this killer,

21:26.151 --> 21:27.617
hopefully we can
put an end to it

21:27.619 --> 21:29.286
before anybody else
starts looking for beasts.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.321
Amen.
Your lips, God's ears.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.156
(phone rings)

21:33.158 --> 21:35.191
Yeah.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.228
Wait, are you sure?

21:39.331 --> 21:41.698
All right, thanks.
What is it?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.566
I.T. says that
the blogger discovered

21:43.568 --> 21:45.669
somebody at DHS
squashed the cold cases,

21:45.671 --> 21:47.704
which you and I know
link to Vincent,

21:47.706 --> 21:48.872
so it means that
the killer knows about...

21:48.874 --> 21:49.939
Agent Russo.

21:49.941 --> 21:51.541
We have to warn him.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.761
CATHERINE:
Freeze!

22:15.033 --> 22:17.567
TESS:
Hands up!

22:17.569 --> 22:18.735
Turn around.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.644
Stop, don't move.
Stop!

22:45.330 --> 22:46.830
So...

22:46.832 --> 22:48.998
how was the honeymoon?

23:07.532 --> 23:09.065
Excuse me.

23:09.067 --> 23:10.433
Is that Agent Russo?

23:10.435 --> 23:12.902
Tortured, too,
just like the blogger.

23:12.904 --> 23:14.604
How the killer
got past security

23:14.606 --> 23:16.339
and surveillance,
I have no clue.

23:16.341 --> 23:18.374
He's obviously a pro.

23:18.376 --> 23:20.076
Wait, what are you guys
even doing here,

23:20.078 --> 23:22.078
how'd you find out?
Uh, Vincent beast-tracked

23:22.080 --> 23:23.279
the killer from
the blogger's apartment.

23:23.281 --> 23:24.747
(whispers):
Really?

23:24.749 --> 23:27.183
Sorry.
Okay, look, obviously he's following

23:27.185 --> 23:28.718
the blogger's trail.
The question is, why is he

23:28.720 --> 23:29.752
torturing and killing people

23:29.754 --> 23:31.287
just to try and find...

23:31.289 --> 23:33.189
You?
Well,

23:33.191 --> 23:34.857
I don't think he
knows it's me yet.

23:34.859 --> 23:37.193
Otherwise why would
he come looking here?

23:37.195 --> 23:38.695
Still, he's getting close.

23:40.599 --> 23:42.332
Real close.

23:46.571 --> 23:48.838
Deputy secretary's
getting nervous.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.873
Can you blame him?
With Russo gone,

23:50.875 --> 23:52.642
he's the only other agent
who knows about this.

23:52.644 --> 23:54.210
Yeah, you think maybe
he's starting to regret

23:54.212 --> 23:55.678
covering for us?
No, he just

23:55.680 --> 23:56.879
wants us to keep it quiet,

23:56.881 --> 23:58.514
especially from
the rest of DHS.

23:58.516 --> 24:00.183
He went out on a limb
to protect us,

24:00.185 --> 24:02.051
he doesn't want it to bite him
in the ass either.

24:02.053 --> 24:03.319
Yeah, well, then
we'd better find

24:03.321 --> 24:05.221
the killer before the
other agents do.

24:05.223 --> 24:06.923
And before
the blogosphere finds out.

24:06.925 --> 24:09.025
Duncan getting
killed was big news,

24:09.027 --> 24:11.227
which only made
the conspiracy theorists

24:11.229 --> 24:13.363
that much more convinced that
somebody's hiding the truth.

24:13.365 --> 24:16.032
Exposure concerns all around.
Yeah, well,

24:16.034 --> 24:18.067
I'm more worried about you
right now. Now that he knows

24:18.069 --> 24:19.268
that you're involved.
He's probably

24:19.270 --> 24:20.703
gonna come
looking for you next

24:20.705 --> 24:22.071
to try and ID me.

24:22.073 --> 24:24.140
At our apartment.

24:24.743 --> 24:26.042
Heather.

24:27.779 --> 24:29.646
(Heather exclaiming)

24:29.648 --> 24:31.247
Heather.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.349
Whoa.

24:34.552 --> 24:35.918
(gasps)
Heather?

24:35.920 --> 24:37.120
Cat?
Kyle?

24:37.122 --> 24:38.888
Keller?
What, you two know each other?

24:38.890 --> 24:40.390
Yeah, he's an EMT.

24:40.392 --> 24:42.558
I was just checking on her.

24:43.595 --> 24:45.395
Aren't you supposed
to be in France?

24:45.397 --> 24:48.031
Yes, and you aren't supposed
to be in our bed.

24:48.033 --> 24:49.632
That's just...

24:49.634 --> 24:50.800
that's wrong.

24:50.802 --> 24:52.802
Wrong.

24:52.804 --> 24:54.570
Right.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.781
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.

25:07.519 --> 25:09.085
(sighs)

25:09.087 --> 25:11.387
Well, that was awkward.
Heath,

25:11.389 --> 25:12.555
we thought you were in trouble.

25:12.557 --> 25:14.357
Trouble, why?
Because

25:14.359 --> 25:15.858
we knew you were staying here,
and someone's

25:15.860 --> 25:17.460
probably after Catherine.

25:17.462 --> 25:18.594
So what else is new?

25:18.596 --> 25:20.096
What? It's
always

25:20.098 --> 25:21.364
either one
of you two.

25:21.366 --> 25:22.999
Or JT, or me.

25:23.001 --> 25:24.100
How long have you known Karl?

25:24.102 --> 25:25.234
Kyle.

25:25.236 --> 25:27.203
And, you know, a while.

25:28.406 --> 25:30.606
Okay, fine. Like a day.
A day?

25:30.608 --> 25:32.108
I don't need your sisterly
judgment right now, okay?

25:32.110 --> 25:33.409
I'm a grown woman.

25:33.411 --> 25:35.211
Who tends to fall
for guys too fast.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.947
I'm sorry.

25:37.949 --> 25:40.049
It's just, I don't think
that now is the best time

25:40.051 --> 25:42.051
to start seeing somebody.

25:42.053 --> 25:42.730
Why not?

25:42.753 --> 25:45.340
Because somebody might
be trying to expose me.

25:45.690 --> 25:48.024
Again, what else is new?

25:48.893 --> 25:50.193
You're serious?

25:50.195 --> 25:51.961
For right now, yeah.

25:51.963 --> 25:53.262
I just think
it's too dangerous

25:53.264 --> 25:56.332
for you, Heath,
and for, uh... Karl.

25:56.334 --> 25:57.700
Kyle.
It's Kyle.

25:57.702 --> 26:00.002
And maybe you should

26:00.004 --> 26:01.637
find a new place to live,

26:01.639 --> 26:02.638
at least until
everything, you know,

26:02.640 --> 26:03.706
blows over.

26:03.708 --> 26:05.641
Really? And when will that be--

26:05.643 --> 26:07.176
in, like, 50 years?

26:09.514 --> 26:11.647
(door opens, closes)

26:11.649 --> 26:13.850
If we're lucky, 50 years.

26:13.852 --> 26:16.018
Oh, come on.
No.

26:16.020 --> 26:18.454
No, she's right, we should
be realistic about this.

26:18.456 --> 26:21.023
Who's to say this will not
continue happening forever?

26:21.025 --> 26:23.259
Hey, hey, we will
find a way out, okay?

26:23.261 --> 26:24.360
Yeah, how?

26:24.362 --> 26:26.496
I-I don't know,

26:26.498 --> 26:28.064
but we will, okay? We
haven't come this far

26:28.066 --> 26:31.601
not to get our
happily ever after back.

26:31.603 --> 26:33.369
Unless, of course,
you want a divorce.

26:33.371 --> 26:35.404
I get the espresso maker.

26:35.406 --> 26:36.606
I get the juicer.

26:36.608 --> 26:38.207
See-- who needs lawyers?
Yes.

26:38.209 --> 26:39.842
I love you.
Mm-hmm.

26:39.844 --> 26:42.078
Okay, so what
are we gonna do?

26:42.080 --> 26:44.113
How are we gonna get this guy?

26:44.115 --> 26:46.349
Well, I think the best way

26:46.351 --> 26:49.185
would be to have him
get me first.

Hmm.

27:01.699 --> 27:04.233

to think this big beast
announcement's still happening.

27:06.704 --> 27:08.871
I can't believe how many people
actually showed up.

Tess could ID the guy
before he actually got here.

27:13.611 --> 27:15.278
I don't even know
what he looks like, I got

27:15.280 --> 27:16.879
no idea what I'm up against.
Just

30:02.260 --> 30:05.294
what you miss, can it?
No, of course not.

30:05.296 --> 30:07.997
But what are we supposed to do
right now, not help?

30:10.635 --> 30:12.602
Hey. Where's Cat?

30:12.604 --> 30:15.738
Uh, I-I lost her.

30:15.740 --> 30:16.873
What?
What?

30:16.875 --> 30:19.242
It was... it was crowded, okay?

30:19.244 --> 30:21.611
And I-I panicked
and I-I just lost her, okay?

30:21.613 --> 30:23.512
It's been a while
since I've done this.

30:23.514 --> 30:25.181
Okay, okay. Did you I.D. him?

30:25.183 --> 30:26.883
No, no. Did you I.D. him yet?

30:26.885 --> 30:28.284
No.
No.

30:28.286 --> 30:29.819
Okay, look.
We need to find this guy

30:29.821 --> 30:32.088
immediately before he does
anything to hurt her.

30:32.090 --> 30:35.424
Okay. Okay, problem is, even
though the deputy secretary's

30:35.426 --> 30:38.394
given us complete access,
nothing pops up on this guy.

30:38.396 --> 30:39.829
All right, well, maybe don't
just look for hit men, okay?

30:39.831 --> 30:42.531
Maybe look for any kind
of killer or mercenary.

30:42.533 --> 30:44.700
The keyword is
“mutilate,” all right?

30:44.702 --> 30:45.868
The guy is creepy.

30:56.848 --> 30:57.980
You sensing something?

30:57.982 --> 30:59.582
Yeah.

30:59.584 --> 31:01.951
This guy's not just

31:01.953 --> 31:04.287
a hit man. He's a expert hunter.

31:04.289 --> 31:05.721
A hunter, what do you mean?
I mean he doesn't

31:05.723 --> 31:07.490
just skin people
for the hell of it.

31:07.492 --> 31:10.493
Okay, look for poachers,
wildlife traffickers,

31:10.495 --> 31:13.195
black-markma smugglers,
maybe even big game hunters.

31:13.197 --> 31:14.864
Seems our killer

31:14.866 --> 31:19.268
thinks
I'm the ultimate trophy kill.

31:25.610 --> 31:28.377
(hisses)

31:28.379 --> 31:30.279
(growls)

31:46.764 --> 31:50.700
Got tired of waiting for you
to wake up, Detective Chandler.

31:50.702 --> 31:53.035
Who are you?

31:53.037 --> 31:54.670
Oh, I think you know who I am,

31:54.672 --> 31:56.605
what I want.

31:56.607 --> 31:58.407
The creature, the beast.

32:00.445 --> 32:02.745
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:02.747 --> 32:05.314
Sure, you do.

32:07.118 --> 32:10.252
Agent Russo told me.

32:10.254 --> 32:12.822
People will say anything
when they're being tortured.

32:12.824 --> 32:15.758
Usually the truth, though.

32:17.061 --> 32:18.828
Okay, look,

32:18.830 --> 32:21.464
I don't have any idea what
Agent Russo was investigating.

32:21.466 --> 32:24.467
I was just there
investigating a murder.

32:24.469 --> 32:27.837
I don't know anything
about... beasts.

32:27.839 --> 32:30.306
I don't... I don't believe
in that crap.

32:30.308 --> 32:32.808
I think you do,

32:32.810 --> 32:34.910
and I think you know who it is.

32:34.912 --> 32:38.114
And seeing as someone's
willing to pay $5 million

32:38.116 --> 32:41.117
to capture one, I think
I should know who it is.

32:41.119 --> 32:43.386
$5 million? There's a bounty?

32:43.388 --> 32:45.454
A credible one, as well.

32:45.456 --> 32:47.089
Otherwise I wouldn't have
gone to all this trouble

32:47.091 --> 32:48.457
to track him down.

32:48.459 --> 32:49.892
Who's putting up the money?

32:49.894 --> 32:51.627
How does he even know it exists?

32:51.629 --> 32:53.095
I don't know and I don't care.

32:53.097 --> 32:56.399
He obviously does.

32:56.401 --> 32:59.235
Actually, you rarely get to know
the buyers in my line of work.

32:59.237 --> 33:02.671
Human targets, exotic
animals-- all the same to me.

33:02.673 --> 33:04.907
But the people who pay me,

33:04.909 --> 33:08.511
they prefer to remain anonymous.

33:11.182 --> 33:13.382
For obvious reasons.

33:19.023 --> 33:21.490
Okay, are you sure it's him?
JT: Facial recognition says yes,

33:21.492 --> 33:23.259
but I'm not sure. It's dark.
Okay.

33:23.261 --> 33:26.228
Okay, which pier?
Either Pier 89 or 90.

33:26.230 --> 33:27.452
Damn it, which one is it?

33:27.477 --> 33:29.467
I don't know. He could
be walking to either one.

33:29.467 --> 33:31.400
Fish and Wildlife busted
a smuggling ring at Pier 89

33:31.402 --> 33:33.436
five years ago. I'm on my way.

33:33.438 --> 33:35.638
It's 89.
Okay, I'll be there.

33:37.108 --> 33:39.008
I know you're repulsed by
what I do, but it's a craft

33:39.010 --> 33:41.010
like anything else.
If there wasn't a market

33:41.012 --> 33:43.079
for this kind of thing,
I wouldn't do it.

33:43.081 --> 33:45.481
I'm really just
a businessman.

33:45.483 --> 33:50.686
Nothing justifies killing
innocent people and animals.

33:50.688 --> 33:53.923
$5 million justifies a lot.

33:53.925 --> 33:56.225
Now,

33:56.227 --> 33:57.860
just give me a name,

33:57.862 --> 34:00.162
and we don't have
to go through all this.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.764
Screw you.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.813
(snarling)

34:51.815 --> 34:55.217
(man groans)

35:13.483 --> 35:15.883
Here's my report.

35:16.485 --> 35:19.457
And you explained how the killer
got impaled how, exactly?

35:19.557 --> 35:22.057
We fought, I kicked his ass,
and he tripped.

35:22.059 --> 35:24.259
Mm-hmm.
(sighs) Mm-hmm.

35:24.261 --> 35:27.162
Another cover-up.
Not completely.

35:27.164 --> 35:29.598
We stopped a poacher,
we shut down

35:29.600 --> 35:32.735
his wildlife smuggling
operation. That is legit.

35:32.737 --> 35:34.203
True. Plus, we kept him

35:34.205 --> 35:36.171
from turning your husband
into a trophy head.

35:36.173 --> 35:37.806
Also true. See, win-win.

35:37.808 --> 35:39.808
Still, Vincent's lucky
he got out of there

35:39.810 --> 35:41.210
before the media arrived.

35:41.212 --> 35:43.612
We're all lucky. Again.
Sorry we keep

35:43.614 --> 35:45.681
dragging you back into this,
Tess.

35:45.683 --> 35:47.216
It's-it's not what we chose,

35:47.218 --> 35:49.084
obviously.
It's not your fault.

35:49.086 --> 35:51.186
It's actually my fault.

35:51.188 --> 35:53.288
If I had just listened
to JT when he first came

35:53.290 --> 35:55.224
to me with this... I just...

35:55.226 --> 35:57.626
I really believed
that it was all over.

35:57.628 --> 36:00.129
Just enough time had passed
since the last beast battle

36:00.131 --> 36:01.563
to give me hope, so...

36:01.565 --> 36:03.165
Well, how do you think I feel?

36:03.167 --> 36:04.933
I got yanked away
from my honeymoon

36:04.935 --> 36:05.901
to find out that there's

36:05.903 --> 36:08.737
a beast bounty
out there.

36:08.739 --> 36:10.406
I guess our work's not done yet.

36:10.408 --> 36:11.874
Will it ever be?

36:20.651 --> 36:23.052
(soft knocking)
Hey.

36:23.054 --> 36:26.021
Hey.

36:26.023 --> 36:29.725
Glad to see you're
still packing, at least.

36:29.727 --> 36:31.927
Yep.

36:31.929 --> 36:35.564
JT, please, I'm sorry, okay?

36:35.566 --> 36:37.566
I should have listened to you.
I should have. I just...

36:37.568 --> 36:40.135
I didn't want to believe it was
all happening again, you know?

36:40.137 --> 36:42.404
I just wanted our real lives
back.

36:42.406 --> 36:44.206
So do I.

36:44.208 --> 36:45.574
Do you, really?

36:45.576 --> 36:47.609
Yes, I do.

You're a police
captain. You make

36:54.285 --> 36:56.952
a big difference, all the time.
I don't.

36:56.954 --> 36:58.620
Are you kidding?

36:58.622 --> 37:01.290
You affect dozens
of college students, hundreds.

37:01.292 --> 37:02.958
That makes a huge difference.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.827

37:04.829 --> 37:08.564
Look, I want normal

something not normal for years,

37:12.570 --> 37:17.039

friend became a beast.

37:17.041 --> 37:18.941
Do I miss it? No.

37:18.943 --> 37:21.610
But did it form me,

change me?

37:24.448 --> 37:27.116
Yeah, it did.

a bigger difference,
