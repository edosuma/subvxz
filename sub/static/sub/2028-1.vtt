Around The World
in 80 Days

01:13.774 --> 01:16.641
To the Bank of England! Quickly!

01:16.710 --> 01:18.143
Surround the building!

01:18.212 --> 01:20.874
You go that way! You go this way!

01:28.589 --> 01:31.057
There he is!

01:31.125 --> 01:33.093
- Come on!
- After him, men!

02:00.487 --> 02:01.511
That way!

02:25.145 --> 02:28.706
- He came this way. I'm sure of it.
- Come on!

02:28.782 --> 02:31.148
Come on, mates! Keep up!

02:35.923 --> 02:37.857
Sorry, sir.

02:59.246 --> 03:03.512
Today is the day I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible.

03:04.084 --> 03:07.542
Man can break
the 50-mile-per-hour speed barrier.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.055
And you're lucky
to be a part of it, Pierre.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.559
- It's Jean Michel, sir.
- Yes.

03:13.627 --> 03:17.290
We will make history.
Or we will die trying.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.697
- Die?
- This is very exciting.

03:20.768 --> 03:24.101
That's it!
I refuse to be catapulted,

03:24.171 --> 03:28.403
electrocuted, or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!

03:30.044 --> 03:32.103
I quit!

03:34.982 --> 03:36.973
He is a very sick man!

03:39.486 --> 03:42.512
The electrocution was not my fault!

03:42.623 --> 03:45.820
You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.917
We're looking for a bank robber.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.130
Is there no man brave enough
to be my valet?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.430
Oh... Aah!

03:59.306 --> 04:00.705
I'm your new valet.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.640
Uh... I must commend
the valet service

04:04.712 --> 04:07.010
on their impeccable foresight.

04:07.081 --> 04:10.312
But they know I only
accept French valets.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.410
Yes. Oh! Oui! Oui!

04:13.520 --> 04:17.149
I come from a long line
of French valets.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.885
On my father's side.
Very, very French.

04:20.594 --> 04:24.462
- But your accent.
- My father French. Never speak.

04:24.531 --> 04:29.594
My mother Chinese and never shuts up.
All the children pick up her accent.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.934
Very well.

04:33.007 --> 04:37.103
Will you be willing to risk your life
to challenge the laws of physics?

04:37.177 --> 04:41.671
- Yes. Uh, and I can sing, too.
- Excellent. Pop this little hat on.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.809
- He's got to be in here.
- He's this way!

04:49.957 --> 04:53.290
And the throttle in your
right hand controls the speed.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.824
- How do I stop?
- Godspeed!

05:19.987 --> 05:21.045
Uh-uh-uh...

05:22.856 --> 05:26.553
Twenty-five miles per hour.
Yes, the pressure's stable-ish.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.757
We need more speed, man.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.265
Waah! Wee-yoo!

05:33.767 --> 05:36.668
Forty miles per hour.
Hang on in there, my good man.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.437
Forty-seven.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.069
Forty-eight.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.943
Forty-nine.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.983
Eureka! We've done it!

05:58.525 --> 05:59.924
Uh...

06:00.961 --> 06:01.985
Waaah!

06:02.062 --> 06:04.553
I say, I say. Uh, good morning.

06:04.631 --> 06:08.397
- I'm looking for a man with...
- Over here!

06:08.469 --> 06:10.266
There he is. There's my valet.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.839
Sorry! New valet.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.452
Whoa!

06:28.522 --> 06:31.389
Whoa!

06:33.293 --> 06:35.693
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:35.762 --> 06:39.664
You'll be able to let go any second.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.291
The pack will run out of steam

06:41.368 --> 06:45.805
in exactly three, two, one.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.636
Now.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.972
Look out!

06:52.546 --> 06:56.073
- That was incredible!
- We've broken the human speed barrier.

06:56.150 --> 06:59.142
Good-bye, sir.

06:59.219 --> 07:02.188
It's been very nice valeting for you.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.993
Let's... do it again soon.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.425
Please, wait!

07:08.495 --> 07:11.555
With you as my brave valet,
I can test all my inventions.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.725
No!

07:13.800 --> 07:15.734
Spread out!

07:15.802 --> 07:17.133
- Cover that...
- Yes, yes.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.037
- I take the job.
- Splendid!

07:20.107 --> 07:22.439
I can't wait to present
my results to the Academy.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.400
RAS

07:24.578 --> 07:27.809
Too kind. Too kind. Thank you.

07:27.881 --> 07:32.580
And with this grant to develop
new applications for copper wire,

07:32.686 --> 07:35.985
Dr. Ramsey invented this.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.555
Needless to say,
the Royal Academy of Science

07:42.629 --> 07:46.531
declared this crackpot
mentally incompetent,

07:46.633 --> 07:50.797
and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.839
Sir. I have an urgent
announcement for you. Here.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.571
Don't just stand there. Read it.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.670
Oh. Um...

08:00.747 --> 08:04.376
"It is with great distress

08:04.451 --> 08:07.147
that Scotland Yard announces

08:07.254 --> 08:09.984
that the Bank of England...
has been robbed."

08:11.658 --> 08:15.253
My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?
You blighter!

08:15.329 --> 08:18.958
You gave me every assurance that
the Bank of England was impenetrable!

08:19.032 --> 08:21.626
Sir, sir, I said, "lmpregnable."

08:21.702 --> 08:24.500
It's the same thing, you idiot!

08:26.206 --> 08:28.731
Please, please, not the quills!

08:28.809 --> 08:30.743
Lord Salisbury!

08:30.811 --> 08:34.804
Please contact General Fang
and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.

08:34.881 --> 08:38.749
To forgo your obligation would
be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.

08:39.785 --> 08:42.380
A woman in the Royal Academy?

08:42.489 --> 08:46.186
The Jade Buddha was delivered
by us to the Bank of England.

08:46.293 --> 08:50.491
- What happens while in British hands...
- Is absolutely your concern.

08:50.530 --> 08:54.022
Colonel Kitchner,
chief of Scotland Yard,

08:54.101 --> 08:55.466
please inform General Fang

08:55.535 --> 08:58.129
what other items were stolen
from the bank.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.663
Nothing else.

09:01.742 --> 09:05.178
Exactly. It seems
your little land dispute

09:05.245 --> 09:08.373
has spilled over
onto our noble shore.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.939
Until the Jade Buddha
is back in my possession,

09:11.051 --> 09:16.353
you and your cause will receive no
British military assistance whatsoever.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.753
Kitchner.

09:20.861 --> 09:25.491
My agents will retrieve the Jade
Buddha once again, Lord Kelvin.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.966
This time, do not let it
slip through your fingers.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.552
A female general.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.887
What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?

09:56.330 --> 09:57.695
Cor!

09:57.764 --> 10:01.564
- Come away from here.
- Oh, Dad. Can't we stay?

10:09.710 --> 10:12.042
My wind-powered pulley system

10:12.112 --> 10:14.637
circulates the house with fresh air.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.707
Kitchen items are to be placed
on the white boat,

10:17.784 --> 10:20.252
and the blue is for laundry.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.686
But most importantly,
this supplies the house

10:22.756 --> 10:26.021
with a running current of electricity.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.124
Electricity.

10:29.196 --> 10:34.031
This is my comprehensive
data schedule and list of regulations.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.969
It's quite simple. You're never
to divert one iota from my plans.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.563
I must live my life
with total efficiency...

10:40.640 --> 10:43.108
to maximize my inventing capacity,

10:43.176 --> 10:47.010
thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind.

10:47.080 --> 10:51.540
Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble,
precise gentleman.

10:52.119 --> 10:56.988
Thank you. Uh... Sorry.
What was your name? Ahem.

10:57.758 --> 11:01.194
Passport. Too.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.787
Passepartout.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.867
Bottled light.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.499
A miracle.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.043
Hardly.

11:18.111 --> 11:22.571
Just undiscovered science from
an American named Thomas Edison.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.516
It turns on with a whistle.

11:27.621 --> 11:30.818
Please don't do that.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.916
Ah, I see your eye is drawn

11:33.026 --> 11:36.621
to what I hope will one day
be my crowning achievement.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.527
A giant moth?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.294
- It's a flying machine.
- It can fly?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.497
Yes.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.370
No. But it will... one day.

11:48.442 --> 11:51.502
One day it will transport people
through the air.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.513
Perhaps over entire oceans.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.214
Uh-oh.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.344
I'm going to have
to make a rule for this.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.730
Dear Father:

12:15.802 --> 12:20.569
I will find the fastest way
back to China...

12:20.640 --> 12:23.074
to make our village safe once again.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.191
Passepartout?

12:40.260 --> 12:45.129
Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.563
Prepare my urban transport device.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.567
Prepare my urban transport device.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.364
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.234
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.170
Clear the way. Clear the way.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.644
Mr. Fogg coming through.
Watch out! Watch out!

13:00.814 --> 13:02.839
Excuse me. Out of way.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.180
- Gangway.
- Fogg's arrived.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.652
- Gangway. Ooh!
- Hey!

13:08.722 --> 13:11.555
That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.616
That will be all.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.963
Gentlemen.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.467
Today I have proved that man

13:22.536 --> 13:25.505
can break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrier

13:25.572 --> 13:28.040
without disrupting
his internal organs.

13:29.175 --> 13:32.702
Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?

13:32.779 --> 13:35.179
What am I thinking? What a fool.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.376
That would mean that you
were a real scientist!

13:40.220 --> 13:42.950
By your definition,
a real scientist's objective

13:43.023 --> 13:45.287
would be to prevent man from progress.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.320
We live in a golden age, Fogg.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.455
Everything worth discovering
has been discovered.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.658
Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insist

13:53.733 --> 13:57.066
on a past filled with dinosaurs...

13:57.137 --> 13:58.661
and evolution.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.933
And on a future filled

14:01.007 --> 14:02.941
with motorized vehicles,

14:03.009 --> 14:05.341
radio waves,

14:05.412 --> 14:07.346
and flying machines!

14:07.414 --> 14:10.645
Confound it! The bloody
Bank of England is a madhouse!

14:12.586 --> 14:15.521
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.
An Asian chap.

14:16.590 --> 14:19.024
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.793
Nothing.

14:26.766 --> 14:31.726
Yes, I heard it was a Chinese fellow,
and he acted alone.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.409
No. Actually,
they say he was Norwegian.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.584
In fact, though, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.914
I heard it from a very reliable source

14:53.026 --> 14:55.961
that it was a gang
of redheaded elderly Norwegians

14:56.029 --> 14:57.428
with very tiny feet.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.327
It's about time
someone robbed that bank.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.632
Like this very institution,

15:04.704 --> 15:06.729
the Bank of England is outdated.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.866
As usual, your contempt
for tradition is appalling.

15:11.077 --> 15:14.137
You rest on your traditions,
if you prefer,

15:14.214 --> 15:18.048
but, as with this bank robber,
progress waits for no one.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.648
So now you're an expert
on the bank thief as well.

15:21.755 --> 15:25.122
Give us the benefit
of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.627
Twenty-six minutes ago,
a ship left Dover for Paris.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.360
From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express,

15:34.434 --> 15:37.835
where he transfers to a steamer,
from Istanbul to India.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.429
In little over a month,
that man could be in China.

15:41.274 --> 15:45.938
If we're to believe Fogg's calculations,
he will have circled the globe

15:46.012 --> 15:47.946
and returned to England in a fortnight.

15:52.452 --> 15:57.754
Actually, by my calculations, it would
be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.063
Outstanding idea.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.102
Well, then, Fogg,

16:10.170 --> 16:13.037
let's see you circumnavigate the world

16:13.106 --> 16:15.540
in 80 days.

16:16.409 --> 16:20.607
I... That would be
a fruitless use of my time.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.875
I'm on the verge of numerous...

16:22.949 --> 16:25.417
countless... scientific breakthroughs.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.749
You coward. Admit it.
It cannot be done.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.390
It can! I could do it.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.792
A wager.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.093
£10,000.

16:39.733 --> 16:43.066
Unlike you and your colleagues,
money does not inspire me.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.269
I believe every man has his price.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.436
Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.

16:51.511 --> 16:56.141
There must be something I could offer
that would be worthy of your time.

16:59.252 --> 17:02.915
There is. Your position as head
of the Royal Academy.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.354
I could lead Britain
and the rest of the world

17:09.429 --> 17:12.057
into a new age of progress
and discovery.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.297
- Fair enough.
- What?

17:19.239 --> 17:23.005
I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow

17:23.076 --> 17:27.672
to surrender my position as minister
of science to Phileas Fogg...

17:27.747 --> 17:29.840
- No!
- No! No!

17:29.916 --> 17:33.852
if he can circumnavigate
the globe...

17:33.920 --> 17:36.480
in no more than 80 days.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.317
But if he cannot,

17:40.393 --> 17:44.420
he must never set foot
in this academy again,

17:44.931 --> 17:50.335
he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore
he calls a laboratory,

17:50.403 --> 17:52.963
and he must swear...

17:53.039 --> 17:56.099
never to invent again.

17:59.813 --> 18:02.145
Just as I always suspected, Fogg.

18:02.215 --> 18:05.673
You promise so much, yet you deliver...

18:05.785 --> 18:07.343
oh, nothing.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.653
- I'll take your wager.
- What did you say?

18:14.561 --> 18:16.495
I'll take your wager!

18:17.530 --> 18:18.895
He did it.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.332
Then it's done.

18:24.404 --> 18:28.704
A man who has never set foot
out of England circling the globe.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.901
This is going to be rather amusing.

18:35.181 --> 18:38.850
History won't remember your amusement,
but it will be hard-pressed to forget

18:38.952 --> 18:44.282
the moment I'm standing on the very top
step of the Royal Academy of Science.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.417
By the strike of noon,

18:47.527 --> 18:51.293
after I, Phileas Fogg,
have traveled around the world

18:52.098 --> 18:54.225
in 80 days!

19:00.907 --> 19:02.306
Oh, dear.

19:03.376 --> 19:08.814
Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.
Mr. Fogg, are you in here?

19:08.882 --> 19:12.079
Phileas! Phileas! Phileas!

19:13.519 --> 19:16.215
- Uh...
- Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.119
Huh?

19:18.191 --> 19:20.125
Uh, Passepartout.

19:21.227 --> 19:24.196
Would you... sit with me a moment?

19:29.802 --> 19:30.894
Yes, sir.

19:36.276 --> 19:39.677
I risked everything,
my entire life's work.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.006
For something you believe in.

19:44.083 --> 19:47.109
Nothing could make
more sense than that, sir.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.425
You are honorable, Passepartout.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.290
But I'm afraid this was
a calamitous lapse of judgment.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.264
- Mr. Fogg?
- Yes?

20:05.972 --> 20:08.839
- Let your family...
- There is no one left to tell.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.508
This house and my inventions
are all I have.

20:18.051 --> 20:23.148
And a brave French valet that will help
you make it around the world in 80 days.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.761
- You really believe we can succeed?
- Yes.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.195
Yes. Yes. Yes!

20:34.267 --> 20:37.259
You're mad. We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.639
We're with you, sir!

20:45.144 --> 20:46.839
Good luck!

20:51.684 --> 20:53.515
Halt!

20:56.289 --> 20:59.850
- Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.
- Thank you, Inspector.

20:59.959 --> 21:05.761
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to detain
you and your valet until further notice.

21:05.832 --> 21:10.235
This here doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.495
Vehicle code?

21:12.572 --> 21:14.335
Code 431.

21:14.407 --> 21:18.503
All vehicles
must be powered by horses.

21:18.578 --> 21:22.412
Or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like,

21:22.482 --> 21:24.347
excluding giraffes and...

21:24.417 --> 21:26.009
You're driveling. Stand aside.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.679
I'm about to embark upon
a journey around the world.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.279
Not in this monstrosity,
you're not. No!

21:31.391 --> 21:33.325
- Mm-mm.
- That's hot.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.025
It's... Ow!

21:47.473 --> 21:50.271
Time to go.
We have a boat to catch.

21:50.343 --> 21:53.779
Stealing a police vehicle is not
an acceptable way to begin our journey.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.041
- Not stealing. Borrowing.
- Excuse us.

21:56.115 --> 21:59.107
We're borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris,

21:59.185 --> 22:01.949
if someone could inform
the appropriate authorities.

22:11.130 --> 22:14.293
Bloody hell! Me brain's leakin'!

22:17.603 --> 22:19.195
Ahh! Damn that nincompoop Fix.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.797
What's the point of hiring
a corrupt police officer

22:21.874 --> 22:24.342
if he can't abuse the law properly?

22:24.410 --> 22:25.843
- Kitchner.
- Sir!

22:25.912 --> 22:27.846
Tell Fix to pack his bags.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.939
- He's going on a trip.
- Right away, sir.

22:30.222 --> 22:33.262
Get the Jade Buddha in Paris.

22:33.542 --> 22:35.741
And Lau Xing...

22:36.101 --> 22:37.781
Kill!

23:01.700 --> 23:05.980
Day 2
PARIS

23:20.233 --> 23:21.325
Hmm. Smart man.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.868
Passepartout, tell this
impudent fellow we must

23:23.936 --> 23:28.339
leave within six and a half hours, or we
miss our connection in Constantinople.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.308
Yes, sir. Please.
We are in a great hurry.

23:31.377 --> 23:32.639
- Passepartout?
- Yes?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.771
In French.

23:40.486 --> 23:42.351
Sacre bleu, la champignon,

23:42.421 --> 23:47.036
chateau, bien, françoise, voilà,
ooh-la-la, foie de gras.

23:48.337 --> 23:49.837
Imbecille!

23:53.099 --> 23:54.794
- What did he say?
- Uh...

23:55.801 --> 23:56.825
He say...

24:04.610 --> 24:06.840
- What?
- He says not to worry.

24:06.913 --> 24:11.009
The next train will leave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.678
Passepartout, this is
a scientific expedition, not a holiday!

24:14.787 --> 24:16.846
I will not miss this train.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.491
Ah!

24:20.560 --> 24:22.289
- Very amazing.
- What?

24:22.361 --> 24:23.953
What does it say?

24:24.030 --> 24:26.430
Eddie Thomason will be
showing his inventions.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.729
Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?

24:28.801 --> 24:31.793
What a chance for you
to meet another great inventor.

24:31.871 --> 24:35.534
I would quite like to tell him
about my whistle modification.

24:35.608 --> 24:36.734
Good idea.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.282
See? Exposition. Science.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.831
I assure you these are not
the works of Thomas Edison.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.425
Uh, I think he is
somewhere around here.

25:03.970 --> 25:07.838
Wait a moment. This isn't science.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.370
This is art.

25:10.443 --> 25:11.876
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.139
That painting is highly inaccurate.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.977
It's not
supposed to be accurate.

25:18.117 --> 25:22.053
The artist views reality
through imagination

25:22.121 --> 25:25.352
rather than simply recording it.

25:25.424 --> 25:28.120
It is called "lmpressionism."

25:29.495 --> 25:32.692
Well, um, I'm not impressed.

25:32.765 --> 25:36.326
Trees are not violet,
grass is not charcoal,

25:36.402 --> 25:38.267
and a man cannot...

25:48.981 --> 25:50.448
fly.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.507
You feel something.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.849
You dream of flying.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.650
Or of naked men.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.191
- Sometimes.
- Ah.

26:00.259 --> 26:03.422
The flying. N-N-Not the men.

26:03.496 --> 26:06.431
I am glad you like my painting.
Monique La Roche.

26:06.499 --> 26:11.723
Phileas Fogg. I must say, it's a lot
better than these amateurs.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.362
What did he say?

26:15.508 --> 26:19.238
- Oh, no.
- God, Manique.

26:22.912 --> 26:25.037
Goodness. What was that all about?

26:25.231 --> 26:26.971
It is mine, do you like it?

26:26.991 --> 26:31.064
Do you like..? No.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.200
To hang something?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.814
Well, a wealthy gentleman
bought my painting for a lot of money.

26:37.915 --> 26:41.660
- Sir...
- Actually, no! You are fired!

26:42.505 --> 26:44.461
Let art artists.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.500
Something wrong?

26:50.621 --> 26:54.900
Well, a wealthy gentleman
bought my painting for a lot of money.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.811
Champagne for everyone!

27:10.062 --> 27:14.123
I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie.
Nice painting.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.532
Have you considered
a career in schematic drawing?

27:20.239 --> 27:22.935
No. It would be far too limiting.

27:23.008 --> 27:25.306
At least your work
shows genuine promise.

27:26.746 --> 27:30.682
Thank you. Those I painted
many months ago.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.684
I was lacking inspiration.

27:32.785 --> 27:36.380
I found some men
to help me find Mr. "Edimon."

27:37.523 --> 27:40.458
- This way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.625
He's very eager.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.197
Get him!

27:54.974 --> 27:58.967
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, it's terrible, no?

27:59.044 --> 28:00.568
No, no, it's...

28:00.646 --> 28:01.908
- clever.
- Oh.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.175
Hmm. Yes.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.172
- He's a clown.
- Mm-hmm.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.309
And yet...

28:07.420 --> 28:09.615
he's incredibly angry.

28:09.722 --> 28:13.158
The irony is, uh, terrifying.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.227
- Is that good?
- Is it?

28:44.690 --> 28:46.089
Ah, this is interesting.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.689
Without opposable thumbs,
a dog could never play poker.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.993
Yes, they can.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.056
Where have you seen
a dog playing poker?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.698
Right there.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.300
Perhaps I'm not the best judge.

29:35.641 --> 29:38.769
Bandits! They come to take away
all the paintings!

29:48.787 --> 29:52.086
- Quickly! Come this way!
- Passepartout!

29:54.693 --> 29:55.921
Go, go, go!

30:17.550 --> 30:21.953
Thank you, Miss La Roche.
You may just have saved our trip.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.512
- There you are.
- I would, uh...

30:24.623 --> 30:27.387
- I would like to repay you.
- Take me with you.

30:27.459 --> 30:31.190
- What?
- I'm stifled here. Pigeonholed.

30:31.263 --> 30:34.892
They think of me only
as a coat-check girl!

30:34.967 --> 30:38.459
- Why?
- Because I am the coat-check girl.

30:38.904 --> 30:40.098
- Ah.
- Look.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.800
The leading art critic in Paris.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.366
Look what he wrote
about one of my paintings.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.381
- I can't read this. It's French.
- I wish I couldn't.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.143
Why do you carry it?

30:51.216 --> 30:56.176
When I do succeed,
I can throw it in his face, but for now,

30:56.255 --> 30:59.224
I need a world journey to inspire me.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.494
I'm inspired to get us
back on schedule.

31:07.933 --> 31:12.029
Let's see. Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots,

31:12.104 --> 31:14.868
factoring in air density...

31:14.940 --> 31:16.202
Outstanding!

31:16.275 --> 31:19.540
Passepartout, onward! Ah.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.712
There we go. Passepartout,
tell him to keep the change.

31:29.822 --> 31:32.222
Uh...
fromage, por favor.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.887
We are going around
the world in 80 days!

31:35.888 --> 31:36.888
My God!

31:37.889 --> 31:39.289
They are fools!

31:41.700 --> 31:43.827
The balloon cannot
support all this weight!

31:43.936 --> 31:46.404
Your hot air should compensate, no?

31:46.438 --> 31:48.463
Get off!

31:56.115 --> 31:58.948
- What are they doing?
- They're being disorderly.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.043
Hey! Let go! Let go!

32:01.153 --> 32:05.954
Hey! Passepartout!
My valise! It has all my money in it.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.069
Hey, lady, lady, lady! It's my bag.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.073
No, that is my bag.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.735
No, that's not your bag. It's my bag!

32:24.810 --> 32:25.868
- No!
- You crazy.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.434
Yes.

32:27.513 --> 32:31.381
That tickles!

32:38.323 --> 32:39.756
You took my bag.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.656
Mr. Fogg!

32:43.062 --> 32:44.290
- Good catch!
- Thank you.

32:57.242 --> 32:58.470
Ooh!

33:02.314 --> 33:04.407
Those are the gallery bandits.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.118
Oh, yes!

33:15.728 --> 33:17.195
Ah.

33:22.167 --> 33:25.603
He stole my purse!
This devil stole my purse!

33:49.161 --> 33:51.652
My bag! He took my... Ah!

33:52.931 --> 33:56.799
- We've stolen that old lady's purse.
- Huh. Here.

33:59.872 --> 34:04.104
We must help Passepartout.
How do I make this go lower?

34:04.176 --> 34:06.906
What are you doing?
Decrease the overall weight...

34:06.979 --> 34:09.208
- That's not going to work.
- Yes, it is.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.149
Physics, no?

34:15.254 --> 34:17.085
Yes.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.393
Ahhh...

34:33.472 --> 34:35.770
Ooh! Ay! Owww.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.012
Bonjour.

34:47.119 --> 34:50.179
Bonjour.

34:51.156 --> 34:53.147
- Eh?
- Bye-bye!

35:00.933 --> 35:03.163
Wake up, lady! Wake up, lady!

35:07.639 --> 35:10.073
Wake up! Lady, wake up!

35:19.184 --> 35:21.015
- Bye, mama.
- Merci.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.086
Bye, baby.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.647
Ohh...

35:33.265 --> 35:36.234
Very impressive. I'd have let go by now.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.664
The statue's grabbing his trousers.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.902
I don't think it's doing it on purpose.

35:59.224 --> 36:02.523
Oh, dear.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.503
Help!

36:22.447 --> 36:24.074
Well done, Passepartout.

36:24.149 --> 36:27.118
We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.085
Yes, yes. Thank you.

36:33.025 --> 36:36.256
Those art thieves
seemed to recognize you.

36:37.129 --> 36:41.930
- I look like someone they know.
- Some other Frenchman, perhaps?

36:44.136 --> 36:49.699
- So, where can we drop you off?
- We're not stopping.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.744
Once we land to board
the Orient Express, you are free to go.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.244
Thank you so much.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.772
- For what?
- I'm free to go with you.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.409
I did not say you were free to come.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.316
- I said you were free to go.
- Where?

37:03.288 --> 37:05.722
- Anywhere.
- Thank you. I will go with you.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.890
- No, you will not, Miss La Roche.
- Monique.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.155
Miss... Monique!

37:12.631 --> 37:14.121
There! Now we are getting along.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.362
Comme c'est beau.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.565
C'est magnifique.

37:23.308 --> 37:24.969
Toutes ces couleurs.

37:25.043 --> 37:28.809
Look at the sunrise.
There is only one word for it.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.474
- "Magical."
- Miss La Roche!

37:31.550 --> 37:34.542
I refuse to allow you
to continue traveling with us.

37:34.653 --> 37:38.646
I'm not traveling with you.
I'm making my own way.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.691
Maybe you shouldn't travel with me.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.387
This is what happens
when you leave your home.

37:43.495 --> 37:46.362
You meet... people!

37:54.706 --> 37:57.937
Why are you keeping up this ruse?

38:01.313 --> 38:06.717
Perhaps I should inform Mr. Fogg,
and together he and I can speculate.

38:16.028 --> 38:20.226
A very sacred object
was stolen from my village.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.289
I have taken it back.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.708
Incroyable.

38:34.646 --> 38:38.514
For many centuries, the Jade Buddha
has protected my people.

38:38.583 --> 38:41.814
It has never left our village until now.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.716
And those art thieves. Who are they?

38:47.826 --> 38:52.354
The Black Scorpions.
They work for an evil warlord. Fang.

38:52.431 --> 38:56.026
She wants the Buddha
so she can take over my village.

38:56.101 --> 39:00.162
I must return the Jade Buddha
to protect Lanzhou.

39:00.238 --> 39:03.036
Mr. Fogg is the fastest way.

39:04.309 --> 39:08.006
Perhaps, then,
we can help one another.

39:08.747 --> 39:12.478
I will keep your secret,
and you convince Mr. Fogg

39:12.551 --> 39:15.076
to allow me to travel
the world with you.

39:22.194 --> 39:26.654
Keep this Dummkopf in his seat,
or we throw him off!

39:28.266 --> 39:32.430
Merely pointing out if they coordinated
their coal-shoveling technique,

39:32.504 --> 39:35.871
they could maximize our speed.

39:37.876 --> 39:42.506
When we reach Constantinople, I suggest
you board a train we are not on.

39:43.482 --> 39:48.249
- Uh, Mr. Fogg, she must come with us.
- And why is that?

39:48.353 --> 39:53.154
Uh, we just discovered that we are
related from the same family.

39:56.161 --> 40:01.497
I'm her father's second cousin's sister
on my mother's side. French.

40:03.268 --> 40:07.102
Monsieur Fogg. If I make the train
go faster, I can come with you, oui?

40:07.172 --> 40:09.868
Yes.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.975
I bid you farewell, Miss La Roche.

40:30.962 --> 40:35.126
If there's anything else you would like,
just let us know, Miss La Roche.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.563
Ah! Voilá.

40:37.636 --> 40:41.834
Champagne with your first-class seats,
Mademoiselle La Roche.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.033
Merci.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.401
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

40:48.513 --> 40:50.242
- Merci.
- Monsieur.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.414
A tea?

41:21.913 --> 41:22.971
Okay.

41:25.550 --> 41:28.348
How to make English tea.

41:29.054 --> 41:31.784
Precisely 96 degrees.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.621
Ooh.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.325
Excuse me, sir.

41:41.399 --> 41:44.368
Fogg's valet!

41:44.469 --> 41:47.461
- A jade Buddha!
- This is not a jade Buddha.

41:47.505 --> 41:51.737
- Oh, yes, it is!
- You're right. But I'm not a valet.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.801
Oh. Really?

41:55.480 --> 41:56.674
Owww!

41:57.916 --> 41:59.941
Me bloody nose!

42:00.051 --> 42:03.851
Let me in!
You're gonna pay for scorchin' me willy!

42:18.403 --> 42:21.031
Heh-heh-heh-heh. Now I gotcha.

42:22.207 --> 42:25.335
Ow! Oh! Ow!

42:25.410 --> 42:28.538
Ahhh!

42:28.613 --> 42:30.604
You're under arrest!

42:32.550 --> 42:34.882
Ah! Ooh! Ow!

42:35.854 --> 42:37.253
Sorry!

42:50.300 --> 42:51.900
TURKEY

42:54.205 --> 42:56.196
Why the devil are we stopping?

42:59.000 --> 43:01.200
Day 10
Istanbul

43:03.982 --> 43:06.314
Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Fogg

43:06.384 --> 43:08.682
and his traveling companions
at his banquet.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.448
How very flattering.

43:10.555 --> 43:14.616
But please inform Prince "Happy"
that we are on a very tight schedule.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.427
Prince Hapi demands it.

43:19.097 --> 43:22.396
Then Prince Hapi
will have to get accustomed

43:22.467 --> 43:24.697
to not getting everything he wants.

43:32.210 --> 43:34.303
It is magnificent.

43:34.379 --> 43:37.212
Mr. Fogg, his house
is even bigger than yours.

43:37.282 --> 43:41.082
His collection, his taste...
It is exquisite.

43:41.152 --> 43:42.642
Yes, it is.

43:43.922 --> 43:46.948
Not good.
Very old. Look. Broken.

43:47.025 --> 43:50.017
And where is His Highness?

43:58.570 --> 44:02.370
Oh. The prince is also
a talented musician.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.170
If I did nothing
but lounge about the palace,

44:05.243 --> 44:07.370
I'd learn to pluck a few notes.

44:20.291 --> 44:22.919
Let's make this brief.
I'll pose for photographs,

44:23.027 --> 44:24.995
wearing a turban,
holding an atlas...

44:25.096 --> 44:26.563
Mademoiselle.

44:28.867 --> 44:33.930
How magical that our paths should cross.
Do you believe in fate?

44:34.005 --> 44:35.597
Is that what you call it

44:35.673 --> 44:38.335
when one stops a train
and kidnaps its passengers?

44:38.410 --> 44:40.503
Phileas Fogg.

44:40.578 --> 44:42.102
Please forgive me,

44:42.180 --> 44:46.776
but I feel like Aphrodite herself
descended to Earth.

44:47.619 --> 44:49.610
What is a ravishing
woman like you...

44:51.589 --> 44:56.549
- I never think when I'm naked.
- I do. In the bath.

44:56.628 --> 44:58.357
- Yes. Well, I mean...
- No!

44:58.463 --> 45:00.431
Don't touch it!

45:00.532 --> 45:05.936
- That is my most treasured possession.
- I was only pointing. I was just...

45:06.004 --> 45:07.869
Don't even point.

45:07.939 --> 45:09.566
Rodin.

45:09.641 --> 45:12.769
Yes. A Rodin.

45:12.844 --> 45:14.243
Oh.

45:14.312 --> 45:17.804
I have never seen a more beautiful...
muscular form.

45:17.882 --> 45:21.875
Well, I can assure you,
I'm in much better shape now.

45:21.953 --> 45:25.218
Incroyable. It is a sculpture of you!

45:25.290 --> 45:26.484
Yes.

45:26.558 --> 45:29.652
"Hapi Birthday.
Your pal, Rodin."

45:29.761 --> 45:33.094
- Come, my dear. Let us dine.
- Yes.

45:34.966 --> 45:37.935
Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.

45:38.002 --> 45:39.993
No, sorry. We are on a tight schedule.

45:40.071 --> 45:43.006
We will join you, actually.
But just one drink.

45:48.947 --> 45:52.246
After the duke and the duchess
sat down in the bath,

45:52.317 --> 45:54.979
I realized I forgot
to put on my bathing suit.

46:00.992 --> 46:02.323
I'm such a fool.

46:02.427 --> 46:06.454
Always embarrassing myself
in front of visiting dignitaries.

46:06.564 --> 46:09.590
But you know how that can be,
right, Phil?

46:09.701 --> 46:11.669
Uh, yes.

46:11.736 --> 46:14.466
Uh, it's Phileas, actually.

46:14.539 --> 46:18.202
So, Foggy, tell me.
I heard you're an inventor.

46:18.276 --> 46:21.643
Well, I try to apply myself
to thinking of new ways

46:21.713 --> 46:24.307
to help better mankind,
if that's what you mean.

46:24.382 --> 46:26.316
Well, I'm not an inventor,

46:26.384 --> 46:30.013
but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry land

46:30.088 --> 46:33.057
so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry.

46:33.124 --> 46:34.284
Oh.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.353
Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.

46:41.833 --> 46:43.733
Not now, Passepartout.

46:45.937 --> 46:47.734
Oh.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.272
Mmm.

46:49.340 --> 46:50.864
- Miss La Roche.
- Hmm?

46:50.942 --> 46:55.140
It is mesmerizing,
the way your face illuminates.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.407
Oh...

46:56.481 --> 46:59.279
Her discoloration could be
an allergic reaction

46:59.350 --> 47:02.012
or a mild form of hives.

47:04.222 --> 47:07.521
Although I've noticed a certain

47:07.592 --> 47:11.289
luminescent glow about her
complexion when she's drawing.

47:11.396 --> 47:15.924
And sometimes, when she's...
concentrating on her latest work,

47:16.034 --> 47:18.594
her ears will actually flutter.

47:21.339 --> 47:25.935
- It's rather fetching.
- Guess who else was in this bath.

47:26.010 --> 47:29.070
U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.

47:30.882 --> 47:33.578
Shouldn't we be going?
We have a schedule to keep.

47:33.651 --> 47:35.710
Thank you for your hospitality.

47:35.787 --> 47:39.484
It's been absolutely fascinating,
but I'm afraid we must push on.

47:39.557 --> 47:40.581
Yes.

47:40.692 --> 47:42.660
Very well.
The gentlemen are free to go.

47:42.694 --> 47:46.186
But Miss La Roche...
stays here with me.

47:46.864 --> 47:48.855
- To be my wife.
- Hmm?

47:48.967 --> 47:51.561
Yes. Wife number seven.

47:52.303 --> 47:55.568
- You have seven wives?
- One for each day of the week.

47:58.176 --> 48:01.612
- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- No more talk!

48:01.679 --> 48:03.146
Prince Hapi has spoken!

48:05.850 --> 48:09.445
Well, we did say one drink.
Passepartout, we're leaving.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.647
I can tell when we're not wanted.

48:15.827 --> 48:16.816
Monsieur Fogg!

48:18.062 --> 48:20.326
Do Tuesdays work for you?

48:21.366 --> 48:24.130
- Good-bye.
- Thank you!

48:28.106 --> 48:30.540
No!

48:31.576 --> 48:32.634
Halt!

48:33.211 --> 48:34.803
Or Hapi gets smashed!

48:34.879 --> 48:39.009
Please! Anything but my statue of me!

48:39.083 --> 48:42.610
Miss La Roche,
please join us, if you will.

48:44.022 --> 48:48.482
- All of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as he says!

48:49.827 --> 48:52.523
- Get in the tent.
- Everybody!

48:52.630 --> 48:56.031
- Now!
- Let's go. Come on.

49:02.507 --> 49:06.841
Now, take off your clothes
and throw them... Uh...

49:06.911 --> 49:10.847
I assure you the statue is not
armed... harmed in any way.

49:26.431 --> 49:29.332
Get them!

49:32.303 --> 49:33.736
His arm!

49:35.039 --> 49:37.303
Thank you, Phileas.
That was very heroic.

49:37.375 --> 49:40.037
Yes, and needlessly time-consuming.

49:40.111 --> 49:43.376
This is exactly why
I should never have let you come along.

49:43.448 --> 49:44.676
Kill them!

49:45.349 --> 49:49.046
I want my arm!

49:49.120 --> 49:52.248
No!

49:52.323 --> 49:56.054
Sir! I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.355
- A-ha!
- According to him,

49:58.463 --> 50:01.694
the bank thief and Fogg's valet
are the same man.

50:01.766 --> 50:04.826
Fogg doesn't realize
he's transporting the bank thief!

50:04.902 --> 50:09.271
Or does he?
He did leave town in quite a hurry.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.308
Wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?

50:11.375 --> 50:13.309
Indeed, Lord Salisbury.

50:13.377 --> 50:15.402
Eh, evading arrest,

50:15.480 --> 50:17.846
stealing a police vehicle,

50:17.915 --> 50:20.645
sounds rather incriminating to me.

50:20.718 --> 50:22.618
One can almost deduce

50:22.687 --> 50:25.451
this entire bet was merely a ruse

50:25.523 --> 50:27.616
to facilitate his escape.

50:28.392 --> 50:32.260
- Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?
- Yes.

50:32.330 --> 50:33.957
Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.

50:34.065 --> 50:37.865
I shall name a beef-related entrée
after you in your honor! Kitchner!

50:37.935 --> 50:40.028
- Sir!
- Inform your men at Scotland Yard

50:40.104 --> 50:45.508
that Phileas Fogg is without a doubt
the man who robbed the Bank of England!

50:45.610 --> 50:49.137
- Where are they now?
- They're taking a train across India,

50:49.180 --> 50:50.738
from Bombay to Calcutta.

50:50.815 --> 50:53.079
Thank God we own India!

50:53.151 --> 50:55.517
I want their faces
in every police station,

50:55.586 --> 50:58.077
army barracks, post office,
railway station and outhouse in India!

51:00.324 --> 51:02.986
We're going to stop Fogg
and get my Jade Buddha back

51:03.094 --> 51:05.824
by any means necessary!

51:05.900 --> 51:07.300
India

51:13.704 --> 51:16.298
Agra is where we will capture them!

51:24.549 --> 51:26.881
Intercept them at Agra!

51:26.951 --> 51:28.680
Carry on, Cutter!

51:28.753 --> 51:31.187
Move it! Move it! Fall in!

51:36.500 --> 51:38.900
Day 24
train to Agra

51:42.266 --> 51:45.099
And they were
the greatest kung fu boxers.

51:45.203 --> 51:47.728
Ten Tigers of Canton.

51:47.772 --> 51:49.103
Brothers in arms.

51:49.173 --> 51:51.937
They fought to keep order
and justice in China.

51:52.009 --> 51:55.467
The most famous of Ten Tigers
is Wong Fei Hung.

52:00.318 --> 52:02.786
Armed with
only bamboo sticks...

52:02.854 --> 52:04.913
It's salivating on... please.

52:04.989 --> 52:06.479
Is this your goat?

52:06.557 --> 52:08.718
Did they really fight like tigers?

52:08.826 --> 52:12.057
Each Tiger have their own
animal fighting style.

52:12.163 --> 52:14.461
Like tiger.

52:14.532 --> 52:17.592
Snake. Snake head, snake tail,
snake mouth, snake tongue!

52:18.636 --> 52:20.365
Where are my calculations?

52:20.438 --> 52:21.837
Monkey!

52:22.907 --> 52:26.536
The goat! Passepartout, I'm being
attacked by a ferocious animal!

52:27.678 --> 52:30.704
- It has small horns.
- Sorry, Mr. Fogg.

52:30.781 --> 52:33.682
Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me.

52:33.751 --> 52:35.810
And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.

52:35.887 --> 52:38.788
Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?

52:39.357 --> 52:41.086
It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg.

52:41.792 --> 52:46.195
How could a man learn to defend himself
by watching animals behave like...

52:46.297 --> 52:48.697
- animals?
- It is famous legend.

52:48.766 --> 52:52.725
- A ridiculous legend.
- Most legends are born from truth.

52:52.837 --> 52:54.600
Yes.

52:54.672 --> 52:58.130
But all truths are born from facts.

52:58.209 --> 53:00.905
Solid, tangible facts
that can be calculated

53:00.978 --> 53:02.707
and written down on paper.

53:02.780 --> 53:06.614
And then eaten by a goat.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.744
Mr. Feelsillious,
when I tell the story

53:09.820 --> 53:13.085
of the man who circled
the entire world in 80 days,

53:13.157 --> 53:15.489
would that not be a legend?

53:18.362 --> 53:21.058
Only if the man's name
was Feelsillious Frog.

53:25.803 --> 53:30.467
- What the blazes is it now?
- Come this way! Come on!

53:30.541 --> 53:33.408
Look sharp, now. Get 'em!

53:33.477 --> 53:35.035
Find these men!

53:35.112 --> 53:40.140
Uh-oh. Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England.

53:40.217 --> 53:43.345
Preposterous. This is a desperate
attempt by Lord Kelvin

53:43.454 --> 53:44.614
to impede my journey.

53:44.655 --> 53:47.146
I am a British citizen.
I have nothing to fear.

53:49.493 --> 53:51.484
Except bullets.

53:52.530 --> 53:54.828
Listen up!
Have you seen these men?

53:56.500 --> 53:58.593
Come on!

54:10.982 --> 54:12.916
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?

54:12.984 --> 54:15.612
They were on the train.
Keep your rifles ready.

54:15.686 --> 54:17.210
They won't get past us, sir!

54:19.223 --> 54:21.885
Ladies, have you seen these two men?

54:23.294 --> 54:26.661
Look closely. They're very dangerous.

54:26.731 --> 54:29.757
They're everywhere!
This is not going to work!

54:29.867 --> 54:33.462
- Just act like ladies.
- Not a problem.

54:33.537 --> 54:36.370
Hello. Hello! Ah.

54:37.708 --> 54:40.973
- I feel faint.
- Phileas, women are not that weak!

54:41.045 --> 54:43.206
No, but I am.

54:49.687 --> 54:52.986
Hello, darling.
What can I do for you, eh?

54:57.395 --> 55:02.389
What nice hand,
nice eye, nice hair...

55:03.434 --> 55:05.561
Hang about!

55:08.939 --> 55:11.931
Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.

55:12.009 --> 55:13.704
Stop, stop.

55:15.946 --> 55:19.882
Go, go, go! Get us out of Agra quickly.

55:19.950 --> 55:22.248
Passepartout, we did it.

55:27.558 --> 55:29.549
Hey, wrong way.

55:29.660 --> 55:30.888
Ah!

55:35.533 --> 55:37.694
Phileas? No! No!

55:42.073 --> 55:44.268
Aah! Run! Run, Passepartout!

55:44.375 --> 55:46.036
Ah! Ah!

55:46.077 --> 55:47.704
Ahhh!

55:47.778 --> 55:49.609
Fogg's valet! Heh!

55:50.181 --> 55:52.411
- What are you doing?
- Now I gotcha!

55:52.917 --> 55:54.578
Hand over the Jade Buddha!

55:55.953 --> 55:56.942
Oh!

55:58.923 --> 56:02.757
You're under arrest! Whoa!
Watch me plums! Ooh!

56:07.364 --> 56:11.164
Now you get him very mad! Let's go.

56:11.235 --> 56:13.430
Stop, or I'll arrest you as well!

56:22.446 --> 56:24.437
Run!

56:25.783 --> 56:27.978
- Which way?
- Down!

56:28.052 --> 56:30.043
Again!

56:31.422 --> 56:32.684
Down!

56:35.326 --> 56:36.452
Jump!

56:40.064 --> 56:42.965
- Go, go, go!
- What's upsetting him?

56:43.067 --> 56:45.900
- He wants the Jade Buddha!
- Then give it to him!

56:49.740 --> 56:53.574
- Phileas, wake up!
- Please, please. You must go.

56:54.578 --> 56:58.514
- My husband will be home soon.
- Phileas!

57:11.195 --> 57:13.163
Ow! Ay!

57:17.067 --> 57:18.728
Phileas, help!

57:18.802 --> 57:20.702
Leave her alone! I'll protect you!

57:20.771 --> 57:22.705
Ah!

57:23.707 --> 57:25.265
I'm here, my dear.

57:25.342 --> 57:28.368
Uh, that stumble was
simply to buy me time.

57:29.380 --> 57:32.679
This cane is not as it appears.

57:32.750 --> 57:37.551
If I depress this button, it would
deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.

57:41.158 --> 57:43.649
This... is...

57:43.761 --> 57:46.423
a strange knife.

57:46.530 --> 57:47.997
Isn't it a sextant?

57:48.899 --> 57:50.867
Yes.

57:57.575 --> 57:59.042
Huh.

58:03.113 --> 58:07.641
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Phileas, that was so unlike you. Ah!

58:07.718 --> 58:09.652
You men, come with me!

58:09.720 --> 58:12.951
You'd better put this on.

58:13.023 --> 58:15.787
Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often.

58:20.431 --> 58:22.422
Oh.

58:22.533 --> 58:24.057
We should run.

58:24.168 --> 58:26.102
- What, now?
- Mm-hmm.

58:27.104 --> 58:28.662
Yes, we should run.

58:33.010 --> 58:35.103
- Break down the door!
- Okay.

58:36.513 --> 58:37.741
No, not me brains!

58:50.327 --> 58:52.795
- Give me the Jade "Bu-ddha"!
- Okay, okay.

58:52.896 --> 58:54.659
What's "Bu-ddha"?

58:57.101 --> 58:59.831
Get ready to jump! Now!

59:13.684 --> 59:16.949
It is him, the Englishman
who robbed the Bank of England!

59:17.021 --> 59:19.717
He's escaping in that palkee-garry!

59:19.790 --> 59:22.156
Hey, there he is!

59:23.594 --> 59:26.119
They'll check all trains heading east.

59:26.230 --> 59:30.599
If we could make it to the coast, we
can't sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.

59:30.668 --> 59:34.001
- They're both British colonies.
- Does England own everything in Asia?

59:34.071 --> 59:37.529
Not China. Not yet.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.000
CHINA

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:33.094
Passepartout?

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:39.494
- You look troubled.
- I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:41.231
You did what you had to.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.830
The fate of your village
is of far greater importance

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:46.774
than any bet Phileas has made.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.075
If he loses, all it will
cost him his money and pride.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:53.605
No, Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that.

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:57.543
What do you mean?

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:04.253
My village!

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:11.128
- Your village?
- Uh... I mean,

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:13.135
my, what a village!

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:14.670
Oh, it's beautiful!

01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:19.065
We do need to stop and
resupply, but we must be off by morning.

01:01:19.366 --> 01:01:22.066
Day 41
Lanzhou village

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.331
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:44.128
Lau Xing.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:47.465
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:00.511
Goodness, that's quite a welcome.
Do these people know him?

01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:04.418
It must be their custom,
the way they welcome all strangers.

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:06.581
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.500
Kids, say hello to my friends as well.

01:02:21.472 --> 01:02:23.770
Whoo!

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.334
Lau Xing.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.600
My son, you're home!

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:39.878
Lau Xing.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.521
Lau Xing.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.600
Who is this man?

01:02:45.662 --> 01:02:46.689
Ah. Uh...

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.100
This is my servant.

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.901
I'm so proud.

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:56.202
My son has a butler.
I'm so happy!

01:02:56.203 --> 01:03:01.303
We must celebrate
Lau Xing returned.

01:03:01.304 --> 01:03:04.304
His servant for us
tract a great feast.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.424
Oh. It's beautiful.

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:17.460
You are very talented.

01:03:17.528 --> 01:03:18.893
Thank you.

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:22.154
You need more blue.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.736
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:36.778
Sorry?

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.214
Vile.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:50.226
Absolutely vile.

01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:00.603
Welcome home, Lau Xing.

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:06.105
Your brothers will be proud.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:09.009
The whole notion of
a lighter-than-air craft cannot work,

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:11.707
unless you can
harness the power of helium.

01:04:11.782 --> 01:04:13.807
Or hydrogen, which is far better...

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:19.320
Yes, well, couldn't have
put it better myself.

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:24.452
As for this Englishman, do you think
such an association is wise?

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:27.724
He is the most disciplined man
I have ever met.

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:30.600
The crane!

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:32.794
The monkey. Very frightening.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.805
Snake.

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:39.398
And, of course, the eagle.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:43.671
Phileas?

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:49.048
Phileas, I made this for you.

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:53.556
Oh, yes.
Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:54.818
What does this say?

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.883
Stupid.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.600
You came back to us our
Sacred Buddha

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.101
This came to our village of hope.

01:05:10.202 --> 01:05:12.402
Drink to health.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.400
Thanks to your courage

01:05:24.501 --> 01:05:26.601
Drink to health.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.685
I've had quite enough.

01:05:31.795 --> 01:05:33.820
I just... I...

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.000
Thanks to your courage

01:05:37.101 --> 01:05:39.001
we live in peace a...

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:41.002
Drink to health.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.000
Thanks to your courage

01:05:48.001 --> 01:05:49.001
we live in peace and harmony

01:05:49.302 --> 01:05:52.002
and for this we are eternally grateful

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:57.803
Drink to health.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:05.425
I am going to be abominably ill.

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:14.000
Drink to health.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.576
I... I want to die.

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:24.774
Please kill me.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.512
"Dear Father:

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:03.747
I will find the fastest way to China."

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:09.320
It's strong.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:20.431
Mr. Fogg, I was going to tell you.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:30.270
- This is your family.
- My name is not Passepartout.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:32.110
It is Lau Xing.

01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:37.853
- I robbed the Bank of England.
- You robbed the Bank of England?

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:41.652
Not for gold or money,
but for the Jade Buddha.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.193
It was stolen from our village.

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:50.062
Phileas, he had no other choice.
This was his only way to get home.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.436
- You knew about this?
- Well...

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.870
I have nothing but respect
for you, Mr. Fogg.

01:08:03.113 --> 01:08:05.809
Then respect my deductive reasoning.

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:09.079
You have both used me.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:11.017
You to escape to China,

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:14.284
and you to travel to further
your impressionistic humbug!

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:17.889
Your overtures of... comradeship,

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:20.019
of friendship, of...

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:27.495
All that was a means to ensure
I would take you along.

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:31.904
My entire life,
I got along splendidly by myself.

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:36.036
You've been pebbles in my shoe,
slowing me down, endangering my life,

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.240
risking everything,
all I've ever lived for.

01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:42.182
And you!

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.247
You knew that.

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:01.933
Don't let him go.
He'll be lost by midnight.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:04.267
Go!

01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:11.511
More of your relatives, I suppose.

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:19.682
You can just forget
about a reference.

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:23.283
I beg a thousand pardons, Mr. Fogg.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.660
What's he screaming about?

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:37.298
He's saying, "Please, let me go.
I'm bored."

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.734
Why is he in prison?

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:51.716
Urinating in public.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:54.621
Charming.

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:57.819
At least he had the decency
to be forthcoming about it.

01:09:57.928 --> 01:10:00.897
Is there anything you've told me
that's even remotely true?

01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:02.692
I really can sing.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.594
# Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:08.501
# Dormez-vous

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:10.004
# Dormez-vous

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:12.837
# Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:15.309
# Ding, ding, ding
Ding, ding, ding

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:18.438
# Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.
Ding, dang, dong. #

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:22.881
Look!

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:28.422
Oh, good. Here comes
Mr. Grumpy and the Leatherettes.

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:38.597
- Where is the Jade Buddha?
- You are better off killing me.

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:44.137
You have nerve.
Are your comrades so brave?

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:48.309
Your threats don't frighten me.
Nor does your silly bracelet.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:52.778
All right. It's not silly.

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:56.842
I spit on you! France spits on you!

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.353
Vive I'Anjou!

01:10:59.356 --> 01:11:02.223
- Your turn will come soon enough.
- Coward!

01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:05.261
Leave them alone. Fight me.

01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:07.387
Yes, fight him.

01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:10.732
Let's see how ferocious you really are.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:00.874
Hey, that's cheating!

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:04.083
- Look out!
- Huh?

01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:06.281
Left!

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.525
Behind you!

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:16.493
No!

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:19.831
- Hit them!
- Silence!

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:26.836
You savages!

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:29.969
Phileas, help him!

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:32.947
- Watch out on the right.
- Huh?

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:34.506
No, my right.

01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:37.085
Stop helping me!

01:12:37.153 --> 01:12:39.018
What's happening?

01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:40.420
Where is Passepartout?

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:41.980
How is he getting on?

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:46.324
I wouldn't say he's winning,
but, uh, I think he's doing all right.

01:12:54.471 --> 01:12:56.632
Go home to mama.

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.318
Huh?

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:17.851
- What took you so long?
- I had to finish my lunch.

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:28.961
Wong Fei Hung!

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:33.841
Surely you're not foolish enough
to take on all of my men by yourself?

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:40.507
Ten Tigers?

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:50.721
Kill them!

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:04.502
Execute the prisoners!
I want their heads on pikes!

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.853
What's happening?

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.249
Phileas!

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.264
Ohhh!

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.067
Passepartout... Knife!

01:14:44.414 --> 01:14:46.575
- Merci.
- You're welcome.

01:16:09.032 --> 01:16:13.628
You promise me that Black Scorpions
will never come back to Lanzhou.

01:16:34.324 --> 01:16:38.021
These are my brothers and sister.
The Ten Tigers.

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:41.290
- But there are only nine.
- Including me.

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:42.830
They're real.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.560
The legend was true.

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:35.847
- Mr. Fogg...
- Passepartout,

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:38.352
or whatever your name is,
save your apologies.

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:42.289
Phileas, he risked his life
for what he believes in.

01:17:42.358 --> 01:17:44.451
If anyone understands that, you do.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.121
Please ensure Miss La Roche
finds safe passage home.

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:51.098
This should be adequate.

01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:56.972
Oh.

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:59.872
I, uh, believe this is your veil.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.143
I will never dress like a woman again.

01:18:08.584 --> 01:18:10.518
Ever.

01:18:10.586 --> 01:18:13.987
Mr. Fogg.
Please let me help you win your bet.

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:19.360
I have secured the services
of a more reliable gentleman.

01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:33.566
Yes. Well, perhaps I'll just, uh,

01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:35.304
travel alone.

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:27.400
Day 61
San Francisco

01:19:27.463 --> 01:19:31.422
Fifi La Belle!
She sings! She dances!

01:19:31.534 --> 01:19:35.163
She does the dance of the...
You, sir, come right in.

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:37.968
See Miss Fifi La Belle in all her...

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.568
Ah, the most modern city in the world.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:45.580
Finally, civilization.

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:52.449
Yoo-hoo!

01:19:52.522 --> 01:19:55.150
Excuse me. Pardon me.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:59.217
Can anyone direct me
to the Pacific Railroad Station?

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.099
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.363
I'm such a... rutabaga sometimes.

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:09.870
No, no, no.
Please, it's my fault entirely.

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:13.238
- Let me, uh...
- Oh... Ah!

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:16.210
Oh. Oh, Lord,
I think I sprained my knee.

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:18.304
Uh! Ooh.

01:20:18.381 --> 01:20:20.576
I should find you a physician.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:23.380
There's a doctor who has
an office around the corner.

01:20:23.452 --> 01:20:27.149
Excellent.
Well, uh, I'll get him for you.

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:28.349
Thank you.

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:31.860
There should be more people
like you in this world.

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:36.896
Whoo, doggy! Jackpot!

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.632
Whoo!

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.500
Three Days Later

01:20:52.882 --> 01:20:54.543
Mon Dieu.

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:58.109
Can you imagine Phileas alone
in a place like this?

01:20:58.187 --> 01:20:59.745
I'm sure he's fine.

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:03.952
Alms.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:05.891
Alms.

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:09.026
Alms for the poor?

01:21:13.636 --> 01:21:14.796
Arms?

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:19.466
You already got arms.
It's money you need.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:23.607
I can't even scrounge proficiently.

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.112
Hey.

01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:29.446
Cheer up, pal. You just gotta
figure out what'll work for you.

01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:33.682
Now, what makes you
different from them?

01:21:33.756 --> 01:21:36.122
I'm hungry and miserable.

01:21:36.192 --> 01:21:38.854
No. You stink.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:43.897
Your stink is your most powerful weapon
in your begging arsenal.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.695
Watch this.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.067
Hey.

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:52.733
- Give me money.
- Sure. Don't touch me. You stink.

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.279
- That guy smells like a dead horse!
- I'm not proud of it.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:22:00.110
Simple, yet effective.

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:01.672
- Yeah, I see.
- You try.

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:04.811
Give it a shot. I got faith in you.

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:09.717
Excuse me. Now, uh, you...

01:22:13.162 --> 01:22:14.151
Ah.

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:18.131
I'm not gonna lie to you.
That's gonna happen about half the time.

01:22:20.803 --> 01:22:22.794
It's a volume business.

01:22:24.974 --> 01:22:28.137
- Hunk of cheese?
- Oh, yes, I would rather...

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:29.802
Maybe later.

01:22:31.347 --> 01:22:34.282
What are them drawings?
You some kind of devil worshipper?

01:22:35.151 --> 01:22:37.711
Don't you be putting a hex on me.
I'll cut you.

01:22:39.088 --> 01:22:42.148
- I'm an inventor.
- That's nice.

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:44.556
Or, rather, I was.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:56.738
One day I will build a machine
that will allow man to fly.

01:22:57.406 --> 01:22:59.738
Flying men? Where?

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:04.673
- Nowhere.
- Where are the flying men?

01:23:04.747 --> 01:23:06.908
- Where are the flying men?
- Over there.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:09.280
The bird men are coming! I knew it!

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:12.411
The bird men are coming!
The bird men are coming!

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.854
The birds! The bird men!

01:23:14.924 --> 01:23:16.892
Bird men! Birds!

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:29.299
"I traveled the world for inspiration

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:34.240
and found it in a man...
who lives what he dreams."

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:18.177
- Phileas?
- No.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:21.613
Passepartout! Monique!

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.218
Mr. Fogg.

01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:31.666
You crossed the Pacific Ocean.
For me?

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:35.830
- We will help you win your bet.
- Mr. Fogg, I would never let you down.

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:40.364
- But why would you do this?
- Because you are our friend,

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:43.309
and perhaps... more.

01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:48.543
More with her. You and me?
We just stick with friends.

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:52.246
- Ooh.
- Oof!

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:56.519
Lord Kelvin, I can
offer you something much more precious

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.753
than a single Jade Buddha.

01:24:58.828 --> 01:25:02.662
Beneath Lanzhou are a series
of untapped jade reserves.

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:07.566
If the town were to be overrun,
those reserves would be ours.

01:25:07.636 --> 01:25:08.796
I see.

01:25:08.871 --> 01:25:12.034
However, should Phileas Fogg
win this race,

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:17.101
I will have neither the power nor
the means to hand over any arsenal.

01:25:17.179 --> 01:25:22.412
Then I will see to it personally
that Mr. Fogg's journey is cut short.

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:26.682
Very well.
Let us consider our deal to be...

01:25:29.024 --> 01:25:31.993
Still, it's a first-rate idea, sir.

01:25:32.061 --> 01:25:36.395
What's this blocking my jade reserves?
That will have to be demolished.

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:39.868
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:42.631
It's not that great.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.400
Day 66
Somewhere In The Desert

01:25:52.982 --> 01:25:56.315
Passepartout went
to get help hours ago.

01:25:56.385 --> 01:25:58.717
What if he's lost, or...

01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:00.584
Don't fret, my dear.

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:04.922
Passepartout's a warrior
with impeccable survival instincts.

01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:09.158
No doubt he'll return with help, and we
will board our train with time to spare.

01:26:09.265 --> 01:26:10.732
Agua.

01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:14.565
Perhaps I'm being a little optimistic.

01:26:14.637 --> 01:26:15.899
Help!

01:26:15.971 --> 01:26:17.871
- Help us!
- Help!

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:20.033
Ah! A rattlesnake!

01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:21.133
Help!

01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:23.474
I don't want to die!

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.775
Ah. Good morning.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Wrigh Bros.
Bicycle Sales and Repairs

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.479
- Howdy.
- Hey.

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:31.951
Crazy English cowboy wannabe man.

01:26:32.021 --> 01:26:35.957
How's about going someplace else?
You're blocking the path.

01:26:36.025 --> 01:26:38.016
Wilbur, it's him.

01:26:39.962 --> 01:26:41.190
I'll be damned.

01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:46.665
Mr. Fogg, my name is Orville Wright.
This is my brother, Wilbur.

01:26:46.735 --> 01:26:50.171
- We're big fans of yours.
- Fan's a strong word.

01:26:50.272 --> 01:26:55.039
Better way to say it's we got a lot
of money riding on you to win your bet.

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:57.442
We're gonna use
our winnings to build this.

01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.915
Orville, maybe now is not the time.
Let me explain it to Mr. Fogg.

01:27:00.983 --> 01:27:05.716
Just one second. Forgive my brother.
He's got his head up in the clouds.

01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:10.282
He's one of these dreamers who thinks
man's gonna go swooshing around

01:27:10.359 --> 01:27:13.453
on the planet
like a little hummingbird.

01:27:13.529 --> 01:27:16.293
Yeah, we're all gonna fly.
He thinks so, too.

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:19.390
It's kind of sad. I'm sorry.
He's kind of a moron.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:23.938
He's mastered the cable steering system.
The drag-and-lift ratio.

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:25.997
- This is brilliant.
- Thank you.

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:29.067
That's what I've been saying,
but Orville doesn't listen.

01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:32.079
All that stuff about mastering...
That's what I say.

01:27:32.147 --> 01:27:36.049
You gotta have faith in me, no matter
how crazy big brother's dreams sound.

01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:38.882
- But you told me...
- You gotta have confidence.

01:27:38.954 --> 01:27:42.048
- You've got to speak up and support me.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:27:42.124 --> 01:27:44.615
Have you come across our friend
on your way here?

01:27:45.694 --> 01:27:47.719
Who are we looking for?

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:48.922
Passepartout.

01:27:49.832 --> 01:27:52.027
You mean the crazy,
half-naked Chinese guy

01:27:52.134 --> 01:27:54.193
we saw running around,
where he was like...

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:57.033
- Singing "Frère Jacques"?
- With a cow skull on his head?

01:27:57.573 --> 01:27:59.063
- Possibly.
- Yes.

01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:02.542
- He's in the back of the wagon.
- Passepartout.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:05.136
- You are alive!
- Is that you, Grandma?

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.252
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck. Go win the bet.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.120
- No pressure, but you gotta win it.
- Bye.

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:19.183
Now, you see, to get the real
classy dames, you gotta invent stuff.

01:28:19.261 --> 01:28:21.786
I did.

01:28:21.897 --> 01:28:23.865
"I did"? What's with the "I did"?

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:27.197
We're the Wright Brothers.
We did. Now go.

01:28:27.369 --> 01:28:30.304
Hyah!

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:41.442
They're not going to make it!

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.100
Worldwide Fogg Frenzy!

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.100
Patent Office Swamped!

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.300
U.S. Bets All Its
Marbles On Fogg!

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.500
Day 72
New York City

01:28:54.563 --> 01:28:57.532
Ah-ha-ha! New York, New York!

01:28:57.633 --> 01:29:00.101
So much to see! So little time!

01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:02.535
Our steamer leaves in ten minutes!

01:29:02.604 --> 01:29:04.572
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

01:29:14.316 --> 01:29:17.342
- We're never going to make it.
- Phileas Fogg?

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.500
Wanted Dead or Alive
Reward $5000

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:23.491
Autograph this for me?
It's for the wife.

01:29:23.559 --> 01:29:27.620
Certainly. This business about me
robbing the Bank of England...

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:30.095
Ah, I'm from Ireland. Nice goin'.

01:29:32.101 --> 01:29:36.834
The boat. Follow me.
I know a shortcut. Make a lane!

01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:43.544
Make a lane!

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:54.184
Where are we?

01:29:54.857 --> 01:29:57.451
- Ah!
- Whoa!

01:29:57.526 --> 01:30:01.860
- That's a big man.
- It is a lady. A French lady.

01:30:02.097 --> 01:30:05.533
She looks like an evil
Chinese warlord to me.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:19.646
Your journey has caused
quite a stir, Mr. Fogg,

01:30:19.715 --> 01:30:21.649
but I'm afraid it ends here.

01:30:21.717 --> 01:30:24.447
Leave them alone.
This has nothing to do with them.

01:30:25.721 --> 01:30:28.121
On the contrary, Lau Xing,

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:32.593
Lord Kelvin and I have made
new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:34.652
Unfortunately for Mr. Fogg,

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:37.891
they entail his... permanent detour.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.627
I knew Kelvin was duplicitous,

01:30:39.735 --> 01:30:42.670
but to align himself
with such a little scoundrel!

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:46.536
You're not a scoundrel,
but you are quite small!

01:30:48.677 --> 01:30:54.115
As in petite, but most definitely lethal
and generally very scary.

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:58.344
One, two...

01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:01.315
- Go!
- Three!

01:31:06.862 --> 01:31:09.092
- Go up there.
- Stop them.

01:31:15.571 --> 01:31:18.039
Passepartout, my cane!

01:31:21.343 --> 01:31:22.503
Uh, there.

01:31:46.435 --> 01:31:49.632
Passepartout!
Help! We are trapped!

01:32:06.388 --> 01:32:07.980
Help!

01:32:11.126 --> 01:32:14.061
Passepartout! Help!

01:32:32.314 --> 01:32:33.645
There you are!

01:32:36.852 --> 01:32:39.320
You have a knife in your buttock.

01:33:06.315 --> 01:33:08.579
It's the evil Chinese warlord!

01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:10.015
- Ooh!
- Huh?

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:12.349
She's coming!

01:33:15.324 --> 01:33:17.121
The boat!

01:33:17.192 --> 01:33:20.093
Up there! Hurry! Go, go, go!

01:33:21.129 --> 01:33:23.893
Go, Mr. Fogg. There's not much time.

01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:44.883
Wait, wait! What am I thinking?

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:46.715
Passepartout can't defeat them.

01:33:46.755 --> 01:33:48.950
He's nine Tigers short.

01:33:51.259 --> 01:33:56.094
Phileas, I do believe you are becoming
the man of my dreams.

01:33:56.198 --> 01:33:58.723
When this is over,
let's hope the arms and legs

01:33:58.834 --> 01:34:01.769
of the man of your dreams
are still attached to the torso...

01:34:01.837 --> 01:34:03.805
of the man of your dreams.

01:34:30.966 --> 01:34:35.164
- You have failed to stop him.
- Then your death will have to suffice.

01:34:54.823 --> 01:34:56.290
Let go of me!

01:34:56.358 --> 01:35:00.294
The book! It's going to fall!
How can we save...

01:35:00.362 --> 01:35:02.523
- Phileas?
- I will save him...

01:35:02.631 --> 01:35:05.259
Wah!

01:35:13.608 --> 01:35:15.303
Mr. Fogg!

01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:30.055
No!

01:35:42.337 --> 01:35:44.430
Oh. Passepartout?

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:56.816
Passepartout!

01:35:56.885 --> 01:35:58.113
- Huh?
- You're alive!

01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:01.747
Are you injured?

01:36:06.194 --> 01:36:09.857
Yes, well, uh...
Rules are made to be broken.

01:36:09.965 --> 01:36:12.798
Or, uh, stabbed by a spiky shoe.

01:36:12.868 --> 01:36:16.861
Mr. Fogg, you missed the ship.
You'll lose your bet.

01:36:16.972 --> 01:36:20.635
Oh. At least I didn't lose a friend.

01:36:30.852 --> 01:36:33.980
You must be the eleventh Tiger.

01:36:34.389 --> 01:36:36.050
Meow!

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:44.521
- Let's go. We must catch the next ship.
- It would never reach London in time.

01:36:47.903 --> 01:36:50.371
No. No! No!

01:36:50.472 --> 01:36:54.465
We are not giving up!
I almost died! You almost died!

01:36:54.543 --> 01:36:57.944
We take the next ship
and win that bet!

01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:03.049
Very well.

01:37:03.118 --> 01:37:04.779
- Let's go.
- Yes!

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:07.448
Thank you.

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:29.000
Day 73
Atlantic Ocean

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:45.849
Yes. Yes! Yes!

01:37:47.529 --> 01:37:49.588
Oh, it's hopeless.

01:37:49.698 --> 01:37:52.633
By those calculations,
I'm still behind by one day.

01:37:52.701 --> 01:37:57.638
- There must be some way!
- Phileas Fogg on my boat?

01:37:58.506 --> 01:38:01.270
What an honor, sir!

01:38:01.343 --> 01:38:05.109
I've quite a penny wagered on you.
The wife's none too happy about it.

01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:10.015
Then again, she hasn't cracked a smile
since that shark almost devoured me.

01:38:10.685 --> 01:38:13.017
Got 'em both in one bite.

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:31.300
Ah, it's Inspector Fix!

01:38:31.373 --> 01:38:35.036
My goodness! He made it
around the world before Fogg!

01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:39.146
I came back from India
the short way, you ninny!

01:38:40.815 --> 01:38:44.012
I take it you don't have
Phileas Fogg in that valise.

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:50.254
A little Jade Buddha, perhaps?

01:39:04.039 --> 01:39:06.633
That's the last
of the coal, Captain.

01:39:16.918 --> 01:39:19.352
Mr. Fogg.

01:39:19.421 --> 01:39:22.447
I'm sorry to say,
we've burnt the last of the coal.

01:39:22.524 --> 01:39:25.186
But I've had a word with the crew,

01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:27.694
and all of them...

01:39:28.363 --> 01:39:30.524
have agreed to burn their shoes.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.064
The effort is appreciated, Captain.

01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:37.070
Unfortunately,
we've gained a mere six hours.

01:39:37.739 --> 01:39:42.574
- Even shoes cannot help us now.
- Must be something we can do.

01:39:51.252 --> 01:39:54.653
That's it.
I've got it.

01:39:55.924 --> 01:39:56.913
Birds.

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:59.482
Excellent idea! We'll burn birds!

01:39:59.561 --> 01:40:01.791
No, we'll fly to London.

01:40:01.896 --> 01:40:05.627
We follow the laws of physics
mastered by the birds millennia ago

01:40:05.734 --> 01:40:09.670
and combine it with the Wright
Brothers' steering system.

01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:12.806
Most people would laugh at you.

01:40:12.874 --> 01:40:16.332
But not us. We care about you.

01:40:23.485 --> 01:40:26.977
Captain, I'm afraid
I have to ask permission

01:40:27.055 --> 01:40:29.500
to dismantle your ship
to build this machine.

01:40:29.657 --> 01:40:31.818
Dismantle Carmen?

01:40:31.893 --> 01:40:34.828
But she's me livelihood,
me most loyal companion.

01:40:34.929 --> 01:40:36.157
Never, never, ever!

01:40:36.264 --> 01:40:39.700
What if I could direct you
to an impeccable physician

01:40:39.801 --> 01:40:42.929
who could replace both your nipples,
at my expense,

01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:46.404
and I will give you enough money
to buy a brand-new ship?

01:40:47.876 --> 01:40:50.504
You had me at the nipples.

01:40:50.845 --> 01:40:54.975
- Cornelius, fetch me me tools! Now!
- Aye, aye, Captain!

01:40:56.518 --> 01:40:57.985
One, two! One, two!

01:41:04.159 --> 01:41:06.150
Timber!

01:41:37.859 --> 01:41:40.453
I'll go sharpen the propeller.

01:41:50.138 --> 01:41:51.935
Wrong way. Not looking.

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:25.200
Day 80
5 hours 54 minutes until noon

01:42:28.176 --> 01:42:30.201
Just one more.

01:42:30.278 --> 01:42:33.076
That's it! Right, lads, tie it off!

01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:37.675
The Greenwich time zone. The last time
I shall set my watch ahead.

01:42:37.919 --> 01:42:40.114
Well...

01:42:40.188 --> 01:42:43.157
- Shall we fly?
- Let's.

01:42:43.892 --> 01:42:48.090
Mr. Fogg. Hurrah!

01:42:48.196 --> 01:42:50.221
Hurrah!

01:42:51.833 --> 01:42:53.801
Inspiring words.

01:42:54.869 --> 01:42:58.430
- Very well. Prepare for takeoff!
- Yes, sir!

01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:15.251
- Mr. Fogg, are you sure?
- No!

01:43:16.991 --> 01:43:19.186
Whoa!

01:43:26.234 --> 01:43:28.725
How the hell are we getting back?

01:43:28.836 --> 01:43:31.703
Whoa!

01:43:34.475 --> 01:43:36.841
- Now!
- Ohhh!

01:43:43.651 --> 01:43:46.984
You did it, Phileas! We are flying!

01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:49.785
My God! It's...

01:43:50.792 --> 01:43:52.054
magical!

01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:55.992
- Better than your dreams?
- Better than my dreams.

01:43:56.097 --> 01:43:57.928
Hey! Don't forget to steer!

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:21.388
It's a...

01:44:21.456 --> 01:44:23.651
a telegram from...

01:44:23.725 --> 01:44:25.818
General Fang, sir.

01:44:34.135 --> 01:44:36.103
We're going to make it!

01:44:40.174 --> 01:44:42.369
- This all right?
- Oh, dear.

01:44:42.443 --> 01:44:46.038
- This is exactly like a dream I had.
- You dream of winning the race?

01:44:46.147 --> 01:44:50.982
- No, of crashing to my death.
- Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.

01:44:53.788 --> 01:44:56.154
- Look up there!
- Great Scott!

01:44:56.224 --> 01:44:58.351
Look! A flying machine!

01:44:58.993 --> 01:45:02.520
- Don't step on the wing!
- It's Phileas Fogg!

01:45:03.664 --> 01:45:06.997
Sir, rumor has it a flying machine
is heading for the Royal Academy,

01:45:07.068 --> 01:45:09.263
our bank thief at the pedals.

01:45:09.337 --> 01:45:11.999
Some people will believe anything.

01:45:12.073 --> 01:45:14.598
A flying machine is
heading for the Academy!

01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:18.736
- The bank thief is pedaling!
- See what I mean?

01:45:18.813 --> 01:45:20.747
Help!

01:45:20.815 --> 01:45:23.215
Well done, Passepartout!

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:25.242
The wing ropes!

01:45:26.521 --> 01:45:30.685
Just a minor setback.
Another minor setback.

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:35.526
All right, this is a major setback.

01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:38.590
A flying machine is headed
for the Royal Academy,

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:41.634
and witnesses swear
that it's Phileas Fogg.

01:45:43.237 --> 01:45:46.673
Faster, Passepartout! Faster!

01:45:46.741 --> 01:45:49.403
- We're losing altitude!
- Landing gear?

01:45:49.477 --> 01:45:52.037
That would have been
an excellent idea!

01:45:55.283 --> 01:45:57.376
The bird men are here!

01:46:00.388 --> 01:46:03.414
No. I will not lose this wager!

01:46:03.491 --> 01:46:07.860
He is not to reach the top step.
Get the police. Here. Now!

01:46:07.929 --> 01:46:11.194
I want Fogg arrested the moment
his feet touch British soil!

01:46:11.299 --> 01:46:12.561
Oh!

01:46:12.667 --> 01:46:14.601
- I'm sorry...
- Right in my ear!

01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:17.661
Passepartout, get back in your seat.

01:46:17.772 --> 01:46:20.673
We're going to return to the ground!

01:46:26.347 --> 01:46:28.577
Stop! Kitchner! Hold your ground!

01:46:29.283 --> 01:46:31.808
Why are they fleeing?

01:46:31.886 --> 01:46:34.047
Cowards!

01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:40.193
Hold on!

01:47:11.025 --> 01:47:12.993
Make it to the top step!

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:15.927
- New Zealand. We didn't go there.
- Top step.

01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:19.158
Arrest them!
They robbed the Bank of England!

01:47:19.901 --> 01:47:23.234
No, no!
Nonsense! Where is your proof?

01:47:23.304 --> 01:47:26.034
This is the Royal Academy of Science!

01:47:26.107 --> 01:47:29.133
We don't need to prove anything!

01:47:29.210 --> 01:47:32.475
Besides which,
by the time you get out of jail,

01:47:32.547 --> 01:47:35.038
you'll have lost the wager.

01:47:39.987 --> 01:47:41.545
Noon.

01:47:41.622 --> 01:47:42.987
We did our best.

01:47:44.492 --> 01:47:48.622
Out of me way! Move it!
I used to be somebody important!

01:47:49.163 --> 01:47:51.461
Should have thrown him
through a higher window.

01:47:51.566 --> 01:47:54.330
- Get off!
- Get rid of this buffoon!

01:47:54.402 --> 01:47:58.998
That's the thanks I get for going
halfway around the world to stop Fogg?

01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:04.373
He also sent a Chinese warlord
to kill Phileas Fogg!

01:48:04.445 --> 01:48:06.140
That's right. He did!

01:48:07.582 --> 01:48:09.846
Lies! All of it!

01:48:13.521 --> 01:48:14.647
- Kitchner!
- Yes?

01:48:15.489 --> 01:48:18.219
- Tell them!
- Oh, well, yes, uh...

01:48:18.292 --> 01:48:21.728
- Well, the thing of it...
- You mumbling moron!

01:48:21.829 --> 01:48:24.195
Salisbury, translate Kitchner's blather.

01:48:24.298 --> 01:48:27.267
I... Me... I... Yes. Yes!

01:48:27.335 --> 01:48:30.395
- Rhodes!
- The thing of it is,

01:48:31.038 --> 01:48:33.006
I don't want to make a fuss.

01:48:33.074 --> 01:48:36.908
You spineless cretins!

01:48:36.978 --> 01:48:41.779
That man stuck me with quills!
Bunches of them!

01:48:41.849 --> 01:48:45.546
Yes! Lord Kelvin's a bully!

01:48:45.653 --> 01:48:50.955
It's true! I hate to admit it,
but I'm a battered lord.

01:48:50.992 --> 01:48:54.120
- No!
- Oh, boo-hoo!

01:48:54.195 --> 01:48:57.426
So what if I did
try to kill Phileas Fogg?

01:48:57.798 --> 01:49:01.131
What are you gutless peons
going to do about it?

01:49:01.202 --> 01:49:05.070
I hold all the power!
I run everything!

01:49:05.139 --> 01:49:10.475
So which of you half-wits
is going to stop me? You? You? You?

01:49:10.544 --> 01:49:13.707
- The queen!
- The queen?

01:49:13.781 --> 01:49:16.648
Oh, the queen!

01:49:16.717 --> 01:49:20.847
That inbred, antiquated old cow!

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:25.949
The only way she could stop me
is if she sat on me!

01:49:26.961 --> 01:49:30.556
With her big, fat royal bottom!

01:49:34.235 --> 01:49:36.760
She's behind me, isn't she?

01:49:37.438 --> 01:49:39.702
Oh, Your Majesty.

01:49:39.774 --> 01:49:44.143
I have just apprehended the culprits
who robbed the Bank of England.

01:49:44.211 --> 01:49:46.645
- No, Majesty!
- Rubbish!

01:49:48.249 --> 01:49:50.240
Quiet!

01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:54.053
I love being able to do that.

01:49:54.121 --> 01:49:56.783
So, Lord Kelvin,

01:49:56.857 --> 01:50:00.452
unsportsmanlike conduct,
attempted murder,

01:50:00.528 --> 01:50:03.725
trading my arsenal for Buddhas.

01:50:03.831 --> 01:50:06.322
How do you know about that?
I never said...

01:50:06.434 --> 01:50:10.803
Admit it. You've been
a naughty boy, haven't you?

01:50:13.174 --> 01:50:18.339
Your Majesty, I assure you,
there is an explanation for all of this.

01:50:18.412 --> 01:50:20.778
What it was, was, was...

01:50:20.848 --> 01:50:23.976
I was... I... I was simply...

01:50:24.051 --> 01:50:25.712
simply...

01:50:27.555 --> 01:50:29.352
Why do they always run?

01:50:29.423 --> 01:50:30.947
Arrest him.

01:50:31.025 --> 01:50:35.860
Get out of my way, you fools!
Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?

01:50:36.797 --> 01:50:40.426
I'll kill you!
I'll have you for this, Fogg!

01:50:40.534 --> 01:50:45.233
So, is this Phileas Fogg's
miraculous flying invention?

01:50:45.906 --> 01:50:48.670
Your Majesty, we all invented it.

01:50:48.743 --> 01:50:52.440
I'm very impressed,
and that doesn't happen often.

01:50:52.513 --> 01:50:53.844
Thank you.

01:50:53.914 --> 01:50:57.543
But still, we failed
to help Phileas win his bet.

01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:03.179
- I'm sorry, Phileas.
- Don't be, my chéri.

01:51:03.257 --> 01:51:07.489
I saw the world.
I learnt of new cultures.

01:51:07.561 --> 01:51:09.893
I flew across an ocean.

01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:11.658
I wore women's clothing.

01:51:12.566 --> 01:51:14.830
Oh?

01:51:15.836 --> 01:51:18.270
Made a friend.

01:51:19.707 --> 01:51:22.369
Fell in love.

01:51:22.443 --> 01:51:25.742
- Who cares if I lost a wager?
- I do.

01:51:25.813 --> 01:51:31.683
- I've got 20 quid riding on you.
- Your Majesty, it has gone 12 noon.

01:51:31.752 --> 01:51:35.313
Correct. Which gives you
24 hours remaining.

01:51:36.056 --> 01:51:38.923
- Could we have miscounted?
- No.

01:51:38.993 --> 01:51:42.895
I moved Mr. Fogg's watch ahead one hour
as we passed each time zone.

01:51:44.298 --> 01:51:46.789
The international date line.

01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:49.870
We set our watches forward
at 20 more time zones, so...

01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:52.962
here it's still day 79.

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.702
- So, we've...
- We've won!

01:52:02.817 --> 01:52:04.341
We won, we won...

01:52:04.418 --> 01:52:07.046
Thank God. Ah!

01:52:11.459 --> 01:52:14.519
Your Majesty, I...
I apologize. Do forgive me.

01:52:14.595 --> 01:52:18.691
- I quite forgot myself.
- Go and win your bet, Mr. Fogg.

01:52:18.799 --> 01:52:21.859
I shall need a new minister of science.

01:52:24.338 --> 01:52:28.206
Uh, yes, of course, Your Majesty.

01:52:30.544 --> 01:52:32.910
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

01:52:33.948 --> 01:52:37.509
Go!

01:52:42.656 --> 01:52:44.624
- We won, Phileas! We won!
- Yes!

01:52:44.725 --> 01:52:46.386
We won!

01:52:48.829 --> 01:52:50.854
Oh, well done!

01:52:57.771 --> 01:52:59.033
Go ahead.

01:53:04.078 --> 01:53:05.340
Oh!

01:53:38.045 --> 01:53:40.570
# Everybody

# A feat for man

01:53:50.791 --> 01:53:55.125
# Eighty days since it all began

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:59.188
# Crowds are cheering for Phileas Fogg

01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:03.634
# Mice are dancing with cats and dogs

01:54:03.704 --> 01:54:05.569
# For he has proved

01:54:05.639 --> 01:54:07.698
# With a positive mind

01:54:07.775 --> 01:54:11.836

# So live your dream for all it's worth

01:54:45.813 --> 01:54:49.840

To shoot for the stars

01:54:49.917 --> 01:54:54.183

To Jupiter or Mars sing
