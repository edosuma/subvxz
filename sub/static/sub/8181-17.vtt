WEBVTT

00:08.857 --> 00:10.592
HEY, HONEY.
YOU READY?

00:10.659 --> 00:11.593
YEP.

00:11.660 --> 00:13.361
DO ME A FAVOR.
TAKE MY LICENSE.

00:13.429 --> 00:14.795
WHAT FOR?

00:14.863 --> 00:16.697
IN CASE WE WANT
TO GET A BEER

00:16.765 --> 00:17.965
AND I HAVE TO SHOW
MY I.D.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.667
DID THEY RAISE
THE DRINKING AGE TO 36

00:19.735 --> 00:21.336
AND NOT TELL ME?

00:21.403 --> 00:22.770
JUST DO IT.

00:22.838 --> 00:25.223
AND, OH...
MY LIPSTICK.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.559
CAN'T YOU KEEP THIS STUFF
IN YOUR PURSE?

00:27.626 --> 00:28.660
IT'S A CONCERT
IN THE PARK.

00:28.727 --> 00:29.827
I DON'T WANT
TO CARRY A PURSE.

00:29.895 --> 00:30.878
I DON'T WANT
TO SIT ON THE WET GRASS

00:30.946 --> 00:32.213
LISTENING TO
AN ABBA TRIBUTE BAND,

00:32.281 --> 00:33.981
BUT WE ALL
HAVE OUR PROBLEMS.

00:34.049 --> 00:35.533
CAN YOU JUST,
PLEASE, THANK YOU.

00:35.601 --> 00:37.802
OH, AND MY HAIR SPRAY.

00:37.870 --> 00:39.837
AND GUM.

00:39.906 --> 00:42.507
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO
NEED THIS OTHER LIPSTICK.

00:42.574 --> 00:43.508
AND MY BRUSH.

00:43.575 --> 00:45.710
AND AN UMBRELLA
IN CASE IT RAINS.

00:45.778 --> 00:48.113
I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.447
LET'S GO!

00:49.514 --> 00:50.448
OK.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:32.441 --> 01:35.410
OH, GUY. I'M TRYING TO
WHIP UP A BATCH OF MOJITOS,

01:35.477 --> 01:38.146
BUT I'LL NEED
30 SPRIGS OF FRESH MINT.

01:38.214 --> 01:39.914
OH, SPRIGS OF MINT?

01:39.981 --> 01:42.950
OUT IN THE GARDEN,
NEXT TO MY ARTICHOKES.

01:43.018 --> 01:45.803
WHEN YOU ASK SOMEONE TO BE
A BARTENDER FOR YOUR PARTY,

01:45.871 --> 01:47.372
THE LEAST
YOU COULD DO

01:47.440 --> 01:49.607
IS GIVE THEM
THE PROPER SUPPLIES.

01:49.675 --> 01:52.727
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO BE BARTENDER.

01:52.795 --> 01:55.913
YOU KNOW WHAT-
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS!

01:57.616 --> 02:00.085
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

02:00.152 --> 02:01.086
THANKS.

02:01.153 --> 02:02.787
11 YEARS.
THAT IS AWESOME!

02:02.855 --> 02:04.222
OH, YEAH.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.825
EASY, LOU. I'M ONE PIZZA
POCKET AWAY FROM BLASTOFF.

02:07.893 --> 02:09.727
I'M GOING TO CHECK
ON MY MOJITO.

02:09.794 --> 02:11.429
OH, OK.

02:11.496 --> 02:15.499
SO, UM...
WHERE'S ARTHUR?

02:15.567 --> 02:16.584
OH, WE CAUGHT A BREAK.

02:16.652 --> 02:17.985
ONE OF HIS OLD
ARMY BUDDIES DIED,

02:18.053 --> 02:20.655
SO HE'S GONE
FOR THE WEEK.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.156
OH.

02:22.224 --> 02:23.157
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

02:23.225 --> 02:25.827
WELL, HE BORROWED
$70 FROM ME,

02:25.894 --> 02:28.462
AND HE SAID
HE'LL PAY ME BACK TODAY.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.815
LOU, LOU, LOU,
THAT MONEY.

02:30.883 --> 02:33.618
SHE'S GONE.

02:37.155 --> 02:38.790
FORGOT TO PUT OUT
THE VEGETABLE PLATTER.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.191
OH, GOOD SAVE,

02:40.259 --> 02:44.095
'CAUSE IT AIN'T A PARTY UNTIL
WE GET SOME BROCCOLI CHUNKS.

02:44.162 --> 02:45.430
THINK EVERYBODY'S
HAVING FUN?

02:45.498 --> 02:46.598
YEAH...

02:46.665 --> 02:49.634
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.
HON, LOOK.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.402
WHAT?

02:51.470 --> 02:54.739
AT OUR WEDDING
WE HAD ABOUT 125 GUESTS.

03:00.580 --> 03:04.282
11 YEARS LATER,
WE HAVE 6.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.884
MIGHT WANT TO PULL
YOUR ATTITUDE BACK A LITTLE.

03:06.952 --> 03:10.188
HEY, YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE
GETTING INTO WHEN YOU MARRIED ME.

03:10.256 --> 03:12.424
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, OK?

03:12.491 --> 03:15.260
THAT CARLA FERRIGNO'S
RUBBING ME THE WRONG WAY.

03:18.380 --> 03:20.532
OH, CAN I HAVE
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION?

03:20.600 --> 03:24.235
LOOK, IT'S BEEN
A GREAT NIGHT,

03:24.303 --> 03:26.638
AND I THINK I SPEAK
FOR EVERYONE WHEN WE SAY

03:26.705 --> 03:29.073
DOUG, CARRIE,

03:29.141 --> 03:30.575
WE LOVE YOU GUYS.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.927
OH, THANK YOU.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.662
AND BECAUSE WE DO,

03:34.730 --> 03:37.115
DEACON AND I DECIDED TO
GET YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING.

03:37.182 --> 03:38.983
NO, WE SAID NO GIFTS!

03:39.051 --> 03:40.334
HEY, THAT WAS YOU.

03:40.402 --> 03:41.386
IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED,

03:41.454 --> 03:43.655
I'M REGISTERED AT
THE JERKY HUT.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.707
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY,

03:45.774 --> 03:48.760
YOU GUYS GOT US THOSE
INCREDIBLE JAZZ STATUES, SO...

03:48.827 --> 03:50.477
WE HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

03:53.365 --> 03:55.282
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN THEM SOMETHING.

03:55.351 --> 03:57.084
IT SAID NO GIFTS
ON THE INVITE.

03:57.152 --> 03:59.687
I KNOW WHAT IT SAID.
WHY DO I LISTEN TO YOU?

03:59.755 --> 04:01.556
CAN WE NOT
DO THIS HERE?

04:16.238 --> 04:17.622
HEY...

04:19.858 --> 04:21.024
THAT'S US.

04:21.093 --> 04:22.827
YEAH.

04:22.894 --> 04:24.095
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.496
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
CARRIE?

04:25.564 --> 04:27.365
WHAT DO I THINK?

04:27.433 --> 04:29.834
I THINK... WOW!

04:32.404 --> 04:33.571
WE FOUND
THIS GREAT ARTIST IN SOHO

04:33.639 --> 04:34.972
WHO CAN
TAKE ANY PHOTOGRAPH

04:35.040 --> 04:36.607
AND MAKE AN OIL PAINTING
OUT OF IT.

04:36.675 --> 04:38.660
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

04:39.962 --> 04:41.512
WE WERE GOING TO GET YOU
OMAHA STEAKS,

04:41.580 --> 04:42.947
BUT WE FIGURED YOU EAT THAT,
IT'S GONE,

04:43.015 --> 04:45.616
BUT THE PAINTING,
THAT'S FOREVER.

04:47.235 --> 04:48.836
ACTUALLY,
I HEARD RED MEAT

04:48.904 --> 04:51.338
STAYS IN YOUR COLON
FOR YEARS.

04:51.406 --> 04:53.191
AGAIN,
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

04:53.258 --> 04:56.544
AND AGAIN,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

05:04.619 --> 05:07.354
WOULD YOU JUST
LET IT GO?

05:07.422 --> 05:09.423
WE WERE IN
WILLIAMS-SONOMA,

05:09.491 --> 05:11.225
I HAD A PANINI GRILL
IN MY HAND,

05:11.293 --> 05:12.994
AND YOU WOULDN'T LET ME
BUY IT FOR THEM.

05:13.061 --> 05:15.529
FOR THE LAST TIME,
THEY SAID NO GIFTS.

05:15.597 --> 05:18.032
DEACON AND KELLY WERE THE ONLY
ONES THAT GOT THEM ANYTHING.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.234
YES, YES. BECAUSE THEY
KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME,

05:20.302 --> 05:22.203
AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE DOUG
AND CARRIE'S GO-TO COUPLE.

05:22.271 --> 05:24.438
GO-TO COUPLE?

05:24.506 --> 05:25.807
THAT'S THE COUPLE
YOU CALL FIRST

05:25.874 --> 05:27.341
WHEN YOU WANT TO GO
TO A MOVIE

05:27.409 --> 05:29.143
OR ON A CRUISE.

05:29.211 --> 05:31.478
THERE'S NO REASON
THAT CAN'T BE US.

05:31.546 --> 05:33.197
EXCEPT WE'RE NOT
A COUPLE.

05:33.265 --> 05:36.017
YOU DO KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

05:36.085 --> 05:38.036
OF COURSE I KNOW THAT.

05:38.070 --> 05:40.337
I'M JUST SAYING THERE ARE
WEEKENDS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE DATES.

05:40.405 --> 05:41.673
IT WOULD BE NICE
TO DO THINGS

05:41.740 --> 05:42.873
WITH DOUG AND CARRIE.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.292
SHOULDN'T WE PUT EFFORT
INTO GETTING GIRLFRIENDS?

05:45.360 --> 05:47.846
HAVE YOU HEARD
ONE WORD I'VE SAID?

05:52.451 --> 05:54.101
OK, NOW WE KNOW.

05:54.169 --> 05:55.402
LOU DRINKS
A LITTLE TEQUILA,

05:55.471 --> 05:57.738
HE STARTS LIFTING PEOPLE
OVER HIS HEAD.

05:57.806 --> 06:00.458
MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY
BIG BOYS BLOW OFF STEAM.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.408
I HOPE SPENCE IS ALL RIGHT.

06:01.476 --> 06:04.078
THAT CEILING FAN
WAS ON HIGH.

06:06.298 --> 06:09.100
SOME SURPRISE, HUH?
FROM DEACON AND KELLY.

06:09.168 --> 06:11.469
YEAH. THEY'RE GREAT,
GREAT PEOPLE.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.670
YEAH.

06:12.737 --> 06:14.838
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO PUT IT?

06:14.906 --> 06:18.193
HOW ABOUT
THE STATEN ISLAND LANDFILL?

06:18.260 --> 06:20.979
CARRIE, THEY'RE OUR FRIENDS.
WE GOT TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE.

06:21.046 --> 06:22.230
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
LOOK AT THIS.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.632
I GOT ONE TINY ARM
AND ONE HUGE ARM.

06:27.085 --> 06:29.269
I THINK
IT'S JUST THE ANGLE.

06:29.337 --> 06:30.355
LOOK AT MY HANDS!

06:30.422 --> 06:34.308
THAT'S A CHICKEN FOOT
AND THAT'S A CATCHER'S MITT!

06:34.376 --> 06:37.295
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT MY FOREHEAD.

06:37.362 --> 06:41.082
I WANT TO SPRAY-PAINT
GRAFFITI ON IT.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.616
AND WHAT'S WITH
THE BEAVER TEETH?

06:42.685 --> 06:45.820
LOOK AT THOSE CHOPPERS.

06:45.888 --> 06:48.489
AT LEAST I CAN SEE
WHERE THEY GOT THAT FROM.

06:48.557 --> 06:50.758
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

06:50.826 --> 06:53.461
NOTHING.
YOUR TEETH ARE PERFECT.

06:53.529 --> 06:54.929
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS,

06:54.996 --> 06:56.714
WE JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH THIS THING.

06:56.781 --> 06:58.583
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO-

06:58.650 --> 07:00.618
WE'LL PUT A NAIL IN THE WALL
AND HANG THE PICTURE.

07:00.685 --> 07:01.986
HOW ABOUT THIS-

07:02.053 --> 07:03.988
WE HANG IT WHEN WE KNOW DEACON
AND KELLY ARE COMING OVER?

07:04.055 --> 07:05.256
DEACON'S HERE EVERY DAY.

07:05.324 --> 07:06.957
THE MAN'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

07:07.025 --> 07:08.642
THEN JUST STICK IT
IN THE CLOSET

07:08.710 --> 07:10.278
AND IF ANYBODY ASKS,

07:10.345 --> 07:11.912
WE JUST HAVEN'T FOUND THE
RIGHT PLACE TO HANG IT YET.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.714
FINE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:13.782 --> 07:15.616
YOU DIDN'T HATE
MY TEETH SO MUCH

07:15.684 --> 07:17.618
WHEN I HAD TO STRIP
THAT SPEAKER WIRE.

07:23.792 --> 07:26.094
WHAT'S UP, FAMILY?
YOU READY TO GO?

07:26.161 --> 07:27.828
JUST FINISHING UP.

07:27.896 --> 07:29.898
SO, WHERE'D YOU PUT
THE PAINTING?

07:29.965 --> 07:31.699
UH, LOOK AT THIS-

07:31.767 --> 07:33.334
SAYS ONE BOWL
HAS 100 PERCENT

07:33.402 --> 07:37.171
OF YOUR DAILY REQUIREMENT OF RIBOFLAVIN.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.706
I HAD THREE BOWLS.

07:38.724 --> 07:41.408
SO I'M GOOD
FOR THE WEEKEND.

07:41.476 --> 07:43.828
THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.097
WHERE'D YOU PUT
THE PAINTING?

07:46.165 --> 07:48.249
OH, THE-OH, YEAH-

07:48.317 --> 07:50.084
HERE'S THE THING.

07:50.152 --> 07:53.170
CARRIE AND I- THE PICTURE'S
JUST SO SPECIAL TO US-

07:53.238 --> 07:55.740
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE PERFECT PLACE

07:55.808 --> 07:57.675
TO HANG IT.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.843
SHE'S GOT HER FAVORITES,
I GOT MY FAVORITES.

07:59.911 --> 08:02.713
SO, WE'RE
JUST KIND OF DEBATING

08:02.781 --> 08:04.114
AND GOING
THROUGH THE PROCESS.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.416
THAT'S BASICALLY
WHAT IT IS,

08:05.484 --> 08:06.950
UNTIL YOU
FIND A PERFECT SPOT.

08:07.018 --> 08:09.603
PROBLEM SOLVED.
I KNOW THE PERFECT SPOT.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.478
OK, A LITTLE BIT MORE
TO THE RIGHT.

08:17.546 --> 08:18.830
HEY!

08:18.898 --> 08:22.083
HEY, CAR.
WE GOT IT UP!

08:22.868 --> 08:25.720
YOU SURE DID!

08:25.787 --> 08:26.987
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:27.055 --> 08:27.988
IT GOT AWAY FROM ME.

08:28.056 --> 08:29.991
LEFT. A LITTLE MORE
TO THE LEFT.

08:30.058 --> 08:31.125
OW!

08:31.193 --> 08:33.561
HEY, DEAC, BABE,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

08:33.629 --> 08:34.929
WE WERE GOING TO HIRE-

08:34.996 --> 08:39.000
HEY, HEY, HEY, THAT IS
NOT HOW THE PALMERS ROLL.

08:39.952 --> 08:42.470
THAT'S NOT
HOW THEY ROLL.

08:42.538 --> 08:43.821
DOUG HAD A GREAT IDEA

08:43.889 --> 08:46.757
TO PUT ONE OF THOSE
ART LIGHTS OVER IT.

08:46.825 --> 08:50.428
DID HE?
GREAT IDEA, DOUG!

08:52.931 --> 08:55.833
SAME SPOT.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.092
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:05.160 --> 09:08.763
DEACON CAME BY AND PUT
THE ART LIGHT UP.

09:11.132 --> 09:13.300
HE SAID
THAT'S HOW THEY ROLL.

09:16.037 --> 09:17.204
ARE YOU CRYING?

09:17.272 --> 09:19.741
NO.

09:19.808 --> 09:20.758
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:20.876 --> 09:23.210
DOUG, I CAN'T LIVE
WITH THIS PAINTING.

09:23.278 --> 09:27.732
I AM WILLING TO LOSE
THEM AS FRIENDS OVER THIS.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.366
FORGET ABOUT
THE STUPID PAINTING.

09:29.434 --> 09:31.936
DOUG, I CAN'T.
I SEE IT IN MY SLEEP.

09:32.004 --> 09:35.840
WHEN I GOT TO THE KITCHEN,
THE EYES FOLLOW ME!

09:35.907 --> 09:37.925
SO, POKE THEM OUT
WITH YOUR GIANT FINGERS.

09:37.993 --> 09:40.078
COME ON,
I'M BEING SERIOUS!

09:40.145 --> 09:42.080
STOP JOKING!

09:43.582 --> 09:45.382
COME ON, CARRIE.

09:45.450 --> 09:46.818
I KNOW
THE PAINTING'S HORRIBLE,

09:46.885 --> 09:48.786
BUT, YOU KNOW,

09:48.854 --> 09:49.954
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.956
NO, I WON'T!

09:52.024 --> 09:53.992
JUST LIKE THAT PURPLE VASE
THAT MY MOM GOT.

09:54.059 --> 09:55.276
YOU HATED THAT THING.

09:55.343 --> 09:56.944
I STILL HATE IT.

09:57.011 --> 09:58.162
BUT YOU DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.798
IT JUST BLENDS IN
WITH ALL OUR OTHER CRAP.

10:00.866 --> 10:05.219
OH, MY GOD! THIS ARM
IS BIGGER. I'M A FREAK!

10:06.205 --> 10:09.524
WOULD YOU STOP IT?
YOUR ARMS ARE PERFECT.

10:09.591 --> 10:10.792
THEY ARE?

10:10.859 --> 10:12.660
YES. COME ON.

10:12.728 --> 10:14.295
IT WAS OUR ANNIVERSARY,

10:14.362 --> 10:16.196
AND I DIDN'T EVEN
GIVE YOU MY PRESENT YET.

10:16.264 --> 10:17.698
OOH,
WHAT'D YOU GET ME?

10:17.766 --> 10:22.136
IT'S UPSTAIRS...
IN THE BEDROOM.

10:22.203 --> 10:24.938
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:25.006 --> 10:27.941
I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU, TOO,
THAT'S UPSTAIRS.

10:29.861 --> 10:31.145
COME HERE, BABY.

10:41.239 --> 10:43.007
ACTUALLY, I GOT TO GO
TO THE GARAGE FOR A SECOND.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.692
YEAH, TAKE YOUR TIME,
BABY.

10:51.116 --> 10:52.816
OK, WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET

10:52.884 --> 10:55.086
THAT YOU COULDN'T TELL US
OVER THE PHONE?

10:55.153 --> 10:57.288
SHOULD I,
OR DO YOU WANT TO?

10:57.356 --> 10:59.157
EITHER WAY.
I COULD.

10:59.224 --> 11:01.926
HEY, CHIP AND DALE.
SPIT IT OUT.

11:03.128 --> 11:05.979
UH, WE'VE DECIDED WHAT
WE WANT TO GIVE YOU GUYS

11:06.047 --> 11:07.581

11:07.649 --> 11:10.817
<i>YOUR CHEF, MOl, WILL
PREPARE A VERITABLE FEAST</i>

11:10.885 --> 11:12.686

BUT THANK YOU.

11:22.531 --> 11:23.364
OH, FUNNY.

11:23.431 --> 11:24.848
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM

11:24.916 --> 11:26.384
TAKING DEACON AND KELLY'S
GIFT.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.686
YOU LIKE THEM BETTER
THAN US. JUST ADMIT IT.

11:28.753 --> 11:31.339
ALL RIGHTY.

11:31.406 --> 11:32.156
I TOLD YOU
THIS WAS LAME.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.007
IT'S NOT LAME!
LISTEN, GUYS,

11:34.075 --> 11:35.609
YOU GOT TO LET US
GET YOU SOMETHING.

11:35.677 --> 11:38.579
SOMETHING THAT WILL TOP
DEACON AND KELLY'S GIFT.

11:38.647 --> 11:42.300
WHY DON'T YOU PUSH US
DOWN SOME STAIRS?

11:43.618 --> 11:44.685
WHAT?

11:44.753 --> 11:46.620
YOU DON'T LIKE
THE PAINTING?

11:46.688 --> 11:48.556
WE HATE THAT THING.

11:48.623 --> 11:50.824
THAT'S TOO BAD!

11:50.892 --> 11:52.827
YOU WANT
TO GET US SOMETHING.

11:52.894 --> 11:55.029
I'VE GOT
THE PERFECT GIFT.

11:55.096 --> 11:56.731
WILL YOU HURRY UP?

11:56.798 --> 11:58.199
SHOULD HAVE ROBBED THIS HOUSE
45 MINUTES AGO.

11:58.266 --> 12:01.402
I HAD TO GET
MY ALLERGY SHOT.

12:01.469 --> 12:03.637
WE'RE NOT STEALING A CAT!

12:05.390 --> 12:07.708
ALL RIGHT, SO, HOW DO
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

12:07.775 --> 12:09.110
YOU STEAL,
I RANSACK?

12:09.177 --> 12:11.679
I REALLY HAD MY HEART SET
ON RANSACKING.

12:11.747 --> 12:13.864
FINE, YOU RANSACK,
I'LL STEAL.

12:13.932 --> 12:16.183
WAIT, WAIT. CARRIE GAVE
US A LIST OF DOUG'S STUFF

12:16.251 --> 12:17.551
SHE WANTS US TO TAKE.

12:20.756 --> 12:22.957
GRAY SWEATPANTS,
TORN IN THE BACK.

12:23.025 --> 12:25.960
EVERYTHING IN
HIS UNDERWEAR DRAWER.

12:26.028 --> 12:28.395
AND HIS MR. FRENCH FRY
MACHINE. ALL RIGHT. FINE.

12:28.463 --> 12:30.131
OK, COOL.

12:30.198 --> 12:32.266
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THEY KNOW IT'S US.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.601
I WANT
TO SET THE MOOD.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.986
HOW DOES
WEARING A SKI MASK-

12:35.053 --> 12:36.904
I WANT TO WEAR
THE MASK!

12:37.973 --> 12:39.840
I'M WEARING THE MASK!

12:39.908 --> 12:41.709
OK.

12:41.777 --> 12:44.128
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

12:44.196 --> 12:46.630
IT'S... IT'S
JUST MY PROCESS.

12:46.698 --> 12:47.598
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

12:51.853 --> 12:53.221
GREAT, THEY'RE BACK!

12:53.288 --> 12:55.789
JUST HURRY UP.
TAKE THE PAINTING!

12:55.857 --> 12:57.124
HURRY!

12:57.192 --> 12:58.509
IT'S STUCK!

12:58.577 --> 13:00.994
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
BE THEIR GO-TO COUPLE!

13:02.831 --> 13:03.514
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

13:03.581 --> 13:04.599
MR. FRENCH FRY MACHINE.

13:04.666 --> 13:05.600
OH, YEAH.

13:10.438 --> 13:12.923
OH, MY GOD!

13:16.144 --> 13:17.078
WHAT?

13:18.981 --> 13:20.815
WHAT?

13:20.882 --> 13:22.383
WE'VE BEEN ROBBED!

13:22.451 --> 13:25.986
WHAT MAKES YOU
SAY THAT?

13:26.054 --> 13:30.041
THE COUCH PILLOW!
IT'S ON THE FLOOR!

13:30.108 --> 13:33.244
THEY WERE PROBABLY
LOOKING FOR LOOSE CHANGE.

13:33.311 --> 13:35.212
OH, GOD... OH, GOD!

13:35.280 --> 13:36.897
THEY PROBABLY
JUST WRECKED THE PLACE.

13:36.965 --> 13:38.332
THEY DIDN'T
TAKE ANYTHING.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.516
GUYS, LOOK.

13:40.618 --> 13:41.952
NOT THE PAINTING.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.088
DAMN IT TO HELL!

13:45.157 --> 13:46.357
DAMN!

13:46.425 --> 13:48.976
WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL
WOULD DO THAT?

13:49.043 --> 13:50.978
AN ANIMAL
WITH GREAT TASTE.

13:56.885 --> 13:59.253
I GUESS YOU GUYS SHOULD
CALL THE POLICE OR SOMETHING?

13:59.321 --> 14:00.337
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

14:00.405 --> 14:03.474
IT'S PROBABLY HALFWAY
TO MEXICO BY NOW.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.593
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE WILL.

14:05.660 --> 14:06.827
WE JUST NEED
A LITTLE TIME.

14:11.449 --> 14:12.616
ALONE.

14:12.683 --> 14:14.985
OH, SURE. OK.

14:15.053 --> 14:16.586
CALL US
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING

14:16.654 --> 14:17.654
OR HEAR ANYTHING.

14:17.722 --> 14:19.189
WE WILL, WE WILL.

14:19.257 --> 14:20.224
TAKE CARE, GUYS.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.392
OK.
YEAH.

14:26.814 --> 14:30.250
IT'S GONE! WHAT A RELIEF! AWESOME.

14:30.318 --> 14:31.651
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

14:31.719 --> 14:34.188
GOOD IDEA. YOU BREAK
OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE,

14:34.255 --> 14:36.290
I'LL WHIP US UP
SOME FRENCH FRIES.

14:37.976 --> 14:39.843
OH, MY GOD!

14:44.165 --> 14:45.366
YOU SAID
THIS WOULD WORK!

14:45.433 --> 14:46.500
I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

14:46.567 --> 14:48.002
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY'D
STAGE A FAKE ROBBERY.

14:48.069 --> 14:49.536
WELL, THEY DID.

14:49.604 --> 14:51.571
GOD, I'VE BEEN
LIVING A NIGHTMARE

14:51.639 --> 14:53.007
EVER SINCE
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

14:57.545 --> 15:01.198
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

15:01.265 --> 15:03.467
WE KNEW YOU GUYS
LIKED JAZZ, SO...

15:03.535 --> 15:05.069
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:05.137 --> 15:08.889
I THINK... WOW.

15:08.957 --> 15:10.341
WE GOT THEM IN HARLEM.

15:10.408 --> 15:12.809
REALLY?

15:12.877 --> 15:15.145
SO, WHERE YOU
GOING TO PUT IT?

15:15.213 --> 15:16.196
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

15:16.264 --> 15:17.764
I DON'T WANT
TO PUT THEM ANYWHERE

15:17.832 --> 15:19.033
UNTIL WE FIND
THE RIGHT PLACE.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.334
YEAH, JUST RIGHT.

15:20.402 --> 15:21.685
I GOT
THE EXACT RIGHT PLACE.

15:21.753 --> 15:23.487
HOW ABOUT RIGHT HERE,
HUH?

15:23.555 --> 15:25.256
BANG!
HA!

15:28.727 --> 15:31.061
YOU SAID, LET'S GET THEM
A REALLY BAD GIFT.

15:31.129 --> 15:32.262
THEY'LL SAY THEY HATE IT,

15:32.331 --> 15:33.764
WE CAN SAY WE HATE
THE JAZZ FIGURINE,

15:33.865 --> 15:36.166
EVERYONE LAUGHS
AND GOES HOME HAPPY.

15:36.234 --> 15:38.068
I KNOW WHAT I SAID.
I'M THE ONE WHO SAID IT.

15:38.136 --> 15:40.120
WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN
EASIER TO SAY

15:40.188 --> 15:41.755
WE HATE
YOUR JAZZ GUYS?

15:41.822 --> 15:43.340
DOUG AND CARRIE
ARE OUR BEST FRIENDS.

15:43.408 --> 15:45.075
THEY WENT TO A LOT OF
TROUBLE TO GET US THOSE.

15:45.143 --> 15:47.127
THOSE THINGS ARE RACIST!

15:47.195 --> 15:50.481
THEY'RE NOT RACIST.
THEY'RE JUST... BAD.

15:50.549 --> 15:54.118
SO, WHAT'S NEXT, GENIUS?

15:58.172 --> 16:00.358
SO, THIS GIRL
AT WORK WALKS IN

16:00.425 --> 16:03.126
WEARING THE SAME SHOES
I BOUGHT THE DAY BEFORE.

16:03.194 --> 16:04.945
I CAN KEY HER CAR,
RIGHT?

16:05.013 --> 16:07.581
SHOES, NO.
SAME HAIRCUT, YEAH.

16:07.649 --> 16:10.233
OH... NOTE TO SELF-

16:10.301 --> 16:11.301
NEXT TIME
I GO TO SUPERCUTS,

16:11.369 --> 16:14.371
DON'T GET THE KELLY.

16:14.438 --> 16:17.491
SO, UH, ANY NEWS
ON THE ROBBERY?

16:17.558 --> 16:19.292
WHAT? NO.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.894
NO... NO.

16:20.962 --> 16:23.029
COME ON, HONEY.
DON'T GO THERE.

16:23.097 --> 16:25.732
IT'S JUST BEEN HARD.
IT'S HARD.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.501
IT'S VERY HARD.

16:27.568 --> 16:29.369
WE FIGURED THAT.

16:29.438 --> 16:31.872
WHICH IS WHY
WE MADE ANOTHER TRIP

16:31.940 --> 16:33.073
BACK TO SOHO!

16:35.777 --> 16:37.678
YOU DID NOT GET US
ANOTHER ONE!

16:37.745 --> 16:38.629
I THINK WE DID!

16:38.697 --> 16:40.046
NO!
YOU DIDN'T!

16:40.114 --> 16:41.898
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

16:41.966 --> 16:45.335
WHOA! WHOA... LOOKIT.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.605
WE SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK ON THE BOYS.

16:47.672 --> 16:49.740
YOU FOUR TALK AMONGST
YOURSELVES, ALL RIGHT?

16:53.712 --> 16:55.529
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

16:55.596 --> 16:56.964
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

16:57.032 --> 17:00.333
MY BIG ARM IS BIGGER,
MY EYES LOOK LIKE RAISINS!

17:00.401 --> 17:02.202
YOU LIKE RAISINS.

17:02.270 --> 17:03.420
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:03.455 --> 17:05.137
YOU JUST LIKE IT BECAUSE
THE PAINTER DID SOMETHING

17:05.205 --> 17:07.240
TO MAKE YOU LOOK
HANDSOME.

17:07.308 --> 17:08.809
YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?

17:10.979 --> 17:12.646
DOUG, I AM TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW,

17:12.714 --> 17:14.647
YOU BETTER TELL DEACON AND
KELLY WE DON'T LIKE THIS

17:14.715 --> 17:15.648
OR I SWEAR,

17:15.717 --> 17:17.718
I AM CALLING A DIVORCE
LAWYER TOMORROW.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.319
11 YEARS. WE HAD A GOOD RUN, DIDN'T WE?

17:19.387 --> 17:20.354
NOT THAT GOOD.

17:20.421 --> 17:21.689
I WAS BEING POLITE!

17:21.756 --> 17:22.922
I TOLD YOU.

17:22.990 --> 17:24.824
WE JUST HAD TO TURN THEM
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

17:24.892 --> 17:26.425
THAT'S WHERE WE WENT WRONG
THE FIRST TIME.

17:26.493 --> 17:27.694
IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

17:27.762 --> 17:29.696
LET'S BRING
THIS BABY HOME.

17:29.764 --> 17:31.298
SO, WHO'S READY
FOR PIE?

17:31.366 --> 17:33.951
ACTUALLY,
WE'RE GONNA GET GOING.

17:34.018 --> 17:36.286
UH, BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:36.354 --> 17:38.889
DOUG DOES HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO YOU GUYS.

17:39.724 --> 17:41.976
UH, YEAH,
THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

17:42.043 --> 17:45.212
AND THE PICTURE
IS AWESOME.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.481
THAT'S IT.
I'M OUT OF BULLETS.

17:48.666 --> 17:50.634
WE HATE
THE JAZZ STATUES.

17:50.701 --> 17:51.802
WHAT?

17:51.869 --> 17:52.903
IT'S TRUE.
WE HATE THEM.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.588
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:54.656 --> 17:56.056
WE GOT THEM
IN HARLEM.

17:56.123 --> 17:57.290
I KNOW.

17:57.358 --> 18:00.961
YOU TELL US EVERY TIME
YOU COME OVER HERE.

18:01.029 --> 18:02.930
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

18:02.998 --> 18:06.266
SO, THE PAINTING
WAS SOME KIND OF PAYBACK?

18:06.334 --> 18:07.117
NO. NO, NO-

18:07.268 --> 18:09.136
WE WERE JUST TRYING
TO FIND A NICE WAY

18:09.204 --> 18:11.905
TO BRING UP THE TOPIC
OF CRAPPY GIFTS.

18:13.174 --> 18:16.610
NICE? I HAVE NIGHTMARES
ABOUT THIS PAINTING!

18:16.678 --> 18:18.779
WELL,
THESE SCARE OUR KIDS.

18:18.846 --> 18:21.882
OH, DO THEY?
BOO-HOO.

18:21.950 --> 18:23.183
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
GIRL.

18:23.251 --> 18:25.018
YOU HATE THEM SO MUCH,

18:25.086 --> 18:26.286
THEY ARE
OUT OF YOUR LIE.

18:26.354 --> 18:27.287
THANK YOU.

18:27.355 --> 18:29.022
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME,
MISS.

18:29.090 --> 18:30.807
'CAUSE WE HAVE PLENTY OF
OTHER BLACK FRIENDS

18:30.875 --> 18:33.010
THAT WOULD LOVE THIS.

18:39.167 --> 18:42.335
LET'S GO TELL THE KIDS
THE GOOD NEWS.

18:47.041 --> 18:51.478
OK... WHICH ONE IS IT, TRUTH OR DARE?

18:51.545 --> 18:52.479
TRUTH.

18:52.546 --> 18:54.114
OK, HERE WE GO.

18:54.182 --> 18:57.551
WHAT WAS YOUR
MOST EMBARRASSING KISS?

18:57.619 --> 19:00.437
UM... THIS
STAYS HERE, RIGHT?

19:00.505 --> 19:02.672
UH-HUH.

19:02.740 --> 19:06.326
THERE WAS THIS COUNSELOR
AT MATH CAMP...

19:06.394 --> 19:07.678
NOW CAN I CALL
DEACON AND KELLY?

19:07.746 --> 19:09.380
RUN, BABY, RUN.

19:09.447 --> 19:11.181
SETTLING INTO MY BUNK...

19:15.420 --> 19:16.886
HONEY, COME ON, PLEASE.

19:16.954 --> 19:17.921
I HAVE TO START DINNER.

19:17.989 --> 19:19.790
I REALLY THINK I CAN TAKE YOU THIS TIME.

19:19.857 --> 19:22.025
OK.

19:23.361 --> 19:24.294
READY?

19:24.362 --> 19:25.295
YEAH.

19:25.363 --> 19:26.296
