16:33.192 --> 16:34.386
That seems appropriate.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.655
I am the leader
of the revolutionary forces.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.720
This is my Capitan,
Senor Alvarez.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.357
Martien has three
U.S. citizens in his prison.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.661
We're going to
get them out.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.498
Nothing can interfere
with the revolution.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.504
No offense, but
from what I've seen,

16:46.572 --> 16:48.233
this isn't much
of a revolution.

16:48.307 --> 16:51.435
Hey, man, you're fighting
hit-and-run
with rocks and sticks.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.738
That ain't no way
to fight a war.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.006
We will endure
as we always have.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.015
In five years of fighting,
Martien has failed
to destroy us.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.711
Or you've made
no progress against him.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.151
It does depend
on how you look at it.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.984
We do not need
outside help.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.616
The revolution is a battle
for the people of San Marcos.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.182
You know, that Russian

17:08.260 --> 17:09.727
who was getting
the grand tour,

17:09.795 --> 17:11.353
isn't here to buy a condo.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.329
You can never stop
the will of the people.

17:13.398 --> 17:17.858
If Martien is snuggling up
to the those guys you can
kiss this revolution goodbye.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.929
STOCKWELL: The Russians
will not affect your mission,
Colonel.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.667
There was no need
to tell you about them.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.903
Well, the people down here
are pretty upset about it.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.444
Now, It may take us
an extra day.

17:27.512 --> 17:31.574
Colonel, you are to get
the men out of prison
and meet the sub on schedule.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.449
You are to have no contact
with the civilians

17:34.520 --> 17:36.420
or the government
of San Marcos.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.919
Now, do it my way.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.058
Is that understood?

17:42.361 --> 17:44.921
You were breaking up
pretty bad there, General.

17:45.297 --> 17:48.391
(VOlCE BREAKlNG UP)
Sir, I don't read you,
but I'll talk to you later.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.774
You're in
a defensive posture.

17:57.309 --> 18:00.142
What you need are a couple
of decisive victories.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.112
As you can see,
we are hardly equipped

18:02.181 --> 18:04.115
to attack Martien's
forces directly.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.810
That's a bad attitude.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.216
We're going to have
to work on that.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.482
Make sure you tie
that hitch real tight,

18:10.556 --> 18:11.955
so we can keep the tension.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.083
A half hitch in time
saves nine.

18:14.493 --> 18:18.054
It is very kind of you,
Frankie, and your friends
to do so much for us.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.654
You are very special.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.231
Yeah, well, when you've
been doing this kind of stuff
as long as I have,

18:23.302 --> 18:26.237
it sort of becomes
second nature,
know what I mean?

18:26.305 --> 18:28.705
I only hope I can
express my gratitude.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.275
Oh, we'll think
of something.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.122
All set, Face.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.685
Couldn't you have found me
something in eelskin?

18:51.763 --> 18:53.094
Okay,

18:53.332 --> 18:56.165
you've got five grenades,
the best M14 we've got,

18:56.235 --> 18:59.204
50 rounds of ammunition,
a synchronized watch,
and this.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.798

there is a requirement
of a five-mile walk

19:06.778 --> 19:09.076
but I think I can swing it
with the board.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.244
Now, don't say anything.
Let's just share the moment.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.176
What you...
Share it!

19:16.855 --> 19:18.152
Your man
Santana could pass,

19:18.223 --> 19:20.282
but the others would be
spotted instantly.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.987
That's true,
but Face has got to
have a back-up.

19:23.061 --> 19:24.426
Very well,
two of our men will go

19:24.496 --> 19:25.895
with Face and Senor Santana.

19:26.064 --> 19:27.531
We're fighting
a revolution here.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.658
We cannot sacrifice two
of our men for their mission.

19:29.735 --> 19:30.963
If they destroy
the weapons,

19:31.036 --> 19:32.731
they are doing us
quite a favor, Juan.

19:32.804 --> 19:33.793
I will go.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.430
Oh, no, no, no.
Forget that.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.372
I'm not even crazy
about me going.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.876
Frankie, this is my country,
I believe in the revolution,

19:39.945 --> 19:42.106
and I will fight
with the others
for that belief.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.273
Okay.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.647
Bueno. Bonita will go.
Juan, you will go as well.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.077
I will not be lead
by foreigners.

19:49.154 --> 19:50.781
Fine, you lead.

to be carrying a grudge.

as I have told you

this is the work
of a small group
of malcontents.

22:19.538 --> 22:23.065

as they did through
the negligence of soldiers.

who allowed the attack

you have an insurgency

with the wrong man.
