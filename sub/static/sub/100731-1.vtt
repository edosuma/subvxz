WEBVTT

03:32.720 --> 03:35.224
You're going to that prom
if I have to sell my body

03:35.257 --> 03:36.058
to get you a date!

03:40.062 --> 03:41.997
Oh honey, you've got
no sense of humor.

03:42.031 --> 03:43.199
I know, Mama.

03:43.232 --> 03:45.800
Did you know, I knew by the
time she was two years old

03:45.834 --> 03:47.136
she had no sense of humor?

03:47.169 --> 03:48.904
And I know where she gets it.

03:48.938 --> 03:51.140
I swear Francie,
you better shut up

03:51.173 --> 03:52.141
or that old Hank's
gonna hear you.

03:52.174 --> 03:56.078
Well he's out with his
cows, his beloved cows.

03:56.112 --> 03:57.246
Still.

03:57.279 --> 04:01.183
Okay, aww, is
that not the sweetest thing

04:01.217 --> 04:02.084
you've ever seen.

04:03.886 --> 04:05.988
Honey I left a little bit
of material up by the bust,

04:06.021 --> 04:07.957
just a little bit, you've
finally got something up there.

04:07.990 --> 04:09.657
I just want you to
flaunt it a little bit.

04:09.691 --> 04:10.292
Mama.

04:11.427 --> 04:12.895
What do you think?

04:12.928 --> 04:13.828
It's just a little bit.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.730
Honey, don't be such a prude.

04:15.763 --> 04:17.366
Well at least
she ain't pregnant.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.068
Are you honey?

04:20.302 --> 04:21.803
Now if Hattie'd take
Iris into her crowd,

04:21.836 --> 04:23.005
she'd have a date by tomorrow.

04:23.038 --> 04:25.241
I know, honey, but I can't
control who that child likes

04:25.274 --> 04:27.977
any more than I can
control the tides.

04:28.010 --> 04:30.312
Honey, you go ahead and
try it on for me, all right?

04:39.188 --> 04:40.923
Ain't you running
late for school?

04:40.956 --> 04:41.756
Yes, Daddy.

04:41.789 --> 04:42.857
All right, get going.

04:48.197 --> 04:50.399
Bring a chance of
clothes with you, honey.

04:52.134 --> 04:53.135
Iris?

04:57.973 --> 05:00.675
I do not want her embarrassing
herself in class, Hank.

05:03.913 --> 05:05.314
You're a horse's
ass, Francine.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.155
He should know.

05:14.890 --> 05:16.192
He's seen enough of 'em.

05:16.225 --> 05:18.127
Oh, gal, you're
too much.

06:46.348 --> 06:50.119
Well, if it
ain't old Stinky Drawers.

06:50.152 --> 06:51.819
Oh man, now she
don't smell too bad

06:51.853 --> 06:55.991
now that she got a pair of
jugs the size of melons.

06:56.025 --> 06:57.259
Here we go, boys, here we go.

06:59.361 --> 07:01.863
Come on, what are you doing?

07:01.897 --> 07:03.265
Iris, what
are you doing?

07:03.299 --> 07:05.134
Come on, Iris.

07:05.167 --> 07:06.335
Hey Iris.

07:06.368 --> 07:07.236
Ain't you
gonna stop, Iris?

07:07.269 --> 07:09.438
Can I walk you to school?

07:09.471 --> 07:10.105
No, thank you.

07:11.340 --> 07:13.909
Oh come on, let me walk you.

07:13.942 --> 07:15.244
Come
on, grab her tits, Mike.

07:15.277 --> 07:16.979
Let me hold your books.

07:17.012 --> 07:18.347
Oh, Iris,
don't be so stingy.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.415
Come on, Mike, do it!

07:19.448 --> 07:21.216
If you let me
carry your books,

07:21.250 --> 07:22.284
I might take you to prom.

07:23.585 --> 07:25.487
Leave me alone.

07:25.521 --> 07:26.955
Let me hold 'em, Iris.

07:28.324 --> 07:29.258
Come on.

07:29.291 --> 07:30.092
What are you waiting for, huh?

07:30.125 --> 07:31.460
Your wedding day?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.262
Then she'll be
waiting a long time then.

07:33.295 --> 07:34.096
Give me!

07:35.164 --> 07:36.532
Stop, stop the truck!

07:37.900 --> 07:39.501
She's in the right
position now, Mikey.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.338
Ah, Jesus H. Christ.

07:42.371 --> 07:45.107
Get back you inbred
son-of-a-bitch!

07:45.140 --> 07:46.275
What the hell?

07:46.308 --> 07:47.543
Shit, that's blood.

07:47.576 --> 07:49.044
Mike, you okay?

07:51.280 --> 07:52.881
You crazy?

07:52.915 --> 07:54.116
What the hell did you do?

07:54.149 --> 07:55.250
You better get back
into that beat up piece

07:55.284 --> 07:58.887
of shit you call a truck
before I let loose, farm boy.

07:58.921 --> 08:00.122
Who the hell are you?

08:00.155 --> 08:01.390
None of
your damn business.

08:01.423 --> 08:03.292
Well, this ain't none
of your damn business.

08:03.325 --> 08:05.461
Come over
here and stand behind me.

08:05.494 --> 08:06.929
Don't you move.

08:06.962 --> 08:08.330
If you
touches you again,

08:08.364 --> 08:10.666
he's gonna be singing
soprano in the church choir.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.134
Where you
think you going, Iris?

08:12.167 --> 08:13.335
Mike, what
the hell you doing?

08:13.369 --> 08:14.303
What're you doin'
you chicken shit?

08:14.336 --> 08:16.171
Whyn't you come on out?

08:16.205 --> 08:19.074
Better get back over
here right now, Stinky.

08:19.108 --> 08:20.376
Son of a bitch!

08:21.343 --> 08:23.045
You do that one more
time you're gonna sorry.

08:23.078 --> 08:24.546
Sorry 'cause I
forgot my manners

08:24.580 --> 08:26.014
or sorry 'cause you're
about to do something?

08:26.048 --> 08:27.282
Mike,
it ain't worth it.

08:27.316 --> 08:30.352
I said move it,
move it, move it.

08:30.386 --> 08:31.653
Get in!

08:32.955 --> 08:34.123
I'll get you, bitch.

08:34.156 --> 08:35.324
Cow fuckers!

08:37.426 --> 08:39.027
Are you okay?

08:39.061 --> 08:41.163
We gotta turn those bastards in.

08:41.196 --> 08:42.030
Bastards!

08:44.533 --> 08:46.435
Hey, where you going?

08:46.468 --> 08:49.471
Wait up a minute, you're
probably in shock or something.

08:49.505 --> 08:51.540
I can drive you if you want.

08:53.308 --> 08:54.243
Is it my mouth?

08:54.276 --> 08:55.444
I'm sorry, I've got a
mouth like a gutter.

08:55.477 --> 08:57.012
I'm from the city.

08:57.045 --> 08:58.614
I can take
care of myself.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.450
No need to thank me.

09:02.384 --> 09:03.452
Anytime.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.289
It's not like I risked
my life or anything.

09:16.632 --> 09:18.467
Welcome to Oklahoma.

10:35.310 --> 10:36.745
Settle down, people.

10:36.778 --> 10:39.448
Young ladies, young gentlemen,

10:39.481 --> 10:41.683
homeroom is starting.

10:41.717 --> 10:42.718
Come on up, sweetie.

10:42.751 --> 10:45.787
Class, this is Margot Richmond.

10:45.821 --> 10:46.822
Maggie.

10:46.855 --> 10:47.656
Excuse me, dear?

10:47.689 --> 10:48.490
I'm called Maggie.

10:48.524 --> 10:50.192
Well, that's fine.

10:50.225 --> 10:53.161
Margot comes to us all
the way from Kansas City.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.097
I expect all of
you to welcome her

10:55.130 --> 10:56.532
to our humble farm town.

10:56.565 --> 10:59.434
If that's what they wear
in the city, you can have it.

11:00.469 --> 11:01.637
She is pretty though.

11:01.670 --> 11:03.305
In a hard kind of way.

11:07.576 --> 11:09.611
And just why are we
late, Miss Deerborne?

11:12.114 --> 11:13.549
Speak up, dear,
I can't hear you.

11:13.582 --> 11:15.250
I went to the nurse's office.

11:16.518 --> 11:17.753
That's the third
time this week.

11:17.786 --> 11:20.322
I don't suppose
you brought a note.

11:20.355 --> 11:22.224
Never mind, just sit down.

11:24.526 --> 11:26.094
You have a seat
too, Miss Richmond.

11:27.596 --> 11:30.566
Okay people, today we will
be identifying different

11:30.599 --> 11:34.736
microorganisms on slides
through our microscopes.

11:34.770 --> 11:38.840
And do not touch
the Bunsen burners.

11:38.874 --> 11:41.476
Alice and Eddie, station one.

11:41.510 --> 11:44.379
Iris and Clarissa, station two.

11:44.413 --> 11:47.516
Can't we switch
partners this week?

11:47.549 --> 11:48.885
I
already told you no.

11:48.918 --> 11:50.887
I just don't understand
why I keep getting stuck

11:50.920 --> 11:53.488
with Iris, just
'cause we're both Ds?

11:53.522 --> 11:54.623
We don't have time

11:54.656 --> 11:57.159
for your social
preferences, Clarissa.

11:57.192 --> 12:00.897
Science doesn't care with
whom you are partnered.

12:09.371 --> 12:10.305
So what'd he do?

12:14.409 --> 12:15.277
What?

12:15.310 --> 12:16.545
Your daddy?

12:16.578 --> 12:18.180
I mean, he must've
done something

12:18.213 --> 12:19.748
to land you all in Wakita.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.650
Did he drink away
the family fortune?

12:21.683 --> 12:23.552
Or was it gambling?

12:24.586 --> 12:26.254
Is that what your daddy did?

12:28.423 --> 12:29.591
Why are you laughing?

12:30.726 --> 12:31.593
Nothing.

12:32.828 --> 12:34.162
I was just...

12:36.899 --> 12:38.266
Nothing.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.535
My daddy invented
terraced farming

12:40.569 --> 12:43.605
which just about saved Oklahoma
from another dust bowl.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.807
He's the richest
man in the tri-county.

12:45.841 --> 12:47.542
That's right.

12:47.576 --> 12:51.546
Wow, my daddy's never done
anything as grand as that.

12:52.982 --> 12:56.251
He just takes pictures
for Life Magazine.

12:56.284 --> 12:56.919
He does not.

12:59.321 --> 13:02.624
Well, if your daddy's
some big photographer,

13:02.658 --> 13:04.493
then what are y'all
doing in Wakita?

13:07.964 --> 13:09.364
Have you ever heard

13:09.398 --> 13:13.268
of Edward R. Murrow's
"Harvest of Shame?"

13:13.301 --> 13:14.636
Yeah, of course.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.338
What is that?

13:16.371 --> 13:17.606
Rhonda.

13:17.639 --> 13:18.774
It's a documentary
on the exploitation

13:18.807 --> 13:19.976
of migrant farm workers.

13:20.009 --> 13:21.476
I already knew
that, Iris Deerborne,

13:21.510 --> 13:22.778
you didn't need to tell me.

13:22.811 --> 13:24.613
You seemed a little confused.

13:24.646 --> 13:25.847
Well, I wasn't.

13:25.882 --> 13:28.918
Anyways, Daddy's
doing a follow-up.

13:30.552 --> 13:32.621
"The hardened heartland
of America" sort of thing.

13:32.654 --> 13:34.690
Local color and all.

13:34.723 --> 13:36.625
So that's why we came here.

13:36.658 --> 13:39.929
Believe me, I despise moving
to some podunk farm town

13:39.962 --> 13:41.329
and soon as I graduate,

13:41.363 --> 13:44.700
you'll see nothin' but my dust.

13:44.733 --> 13:46.635
I'm gonna be an airline hostess.

13:46.668 --> 13:48.437
They interviewed me
back in Kansas City

13:48.470 --> 13:49.638
and since I'm already 18,

13:49.671 --> 13:51.606
they said I could
just start right away.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.642
Then I'll just travel the world.

13:54.776 --> 13:55.844
I've been to Tulsa.

13:59.681 --> 14:01.717
Take my daddy, for instance,

14:01.750 --> 14:04.352
he flies all around the world.

14:04.386 --> 14:07.656
You might have even seen the
picture he did for Marilyn.

14:07.689 --> 14:10.026
Like Marilyn Monroe?

14:10.059 --> 14:11.894
Well, who else?

14:11.928 --> 14:14.696
He mostly does
political events.

14:14.730 --> 14:18.734
You know, wars, summit
hearings, stuff like that,

14:18.767 --> 14:21.703
but every now and then
Hollywood needs him

14:21.737 --> 14:22.939
to take some picture

14:22.972 --> 14:25.307
to capture some famous
person's true essence.

14:27.642 --> 14:29.879
Celebrities are real picky
about who shoots 'em.

14:29.912 --> 14:33.315
And Marilyn's very
particular about her nose.

14:39.721 --> 14:41.757
You
should be a songbird.

14:41.790 --> 14:44.693
Definitely, she'd fit
right in with the girls.

14:44.726 --> 14:46.728
Mrs. Hubbard loves us.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.730
We can get you in, no problem.

14:49.731 --> 14:50.732
Maybe.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.742
Do you
know what we're doing?

16:23.025 --> 16:23.859
Hello?

16:28.463 --> 16:31.833
I'll be right back.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.939
Hi, I'm Grace Richmond.

16:36.973 --> 16:38.941
I have a two
o'clock appointment.

16:41.944 --> 16:42.811
Come on in.

16:46.949 --> 16:49.584
You have simply got to go
to the Disciples of Christ.

16:49.618 --> 16:50.887
You will love Reverend Steve.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.587
We just love Reverend Steve.

16:52.621 --> 16:54.856
He has the most
scandalous cleft chin.

16:54.891 --> 16:56.192
Like one of them
models on the cover

16:56.225 --> 16:59.929
of those Harlequin
Romances.

17:01.863 --> 17:03.498
You are a Christian?

17:03.531 --> 17:04.399
Of course.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.835
And I'm sure joining the church

17:06.868 --> 17:09.571
will help us get to know
your wonderful community.

17:10.973 --> 17:13.575
My daughter, Maggie, had her
first day at Wakita High.

17:13.608 --> 17:14.809
Oh, my
Hattie goes there.

17:14.843 --> 17:16.845
Oh, and my Clarissa too.

17:16.879 --> 17:20.849
They will love her if
she is anything like you.

17:20.883 --> 17:23.920
Miss Atkins, I think I've
got that fence shored up

17:23.953 --> 17:25.121
real good for you now.

17:26.521 --> 17:28.224
You'd like to come
take a look at it?

17:28.257 --> 17:30.592
Oh, I'm sure everything
looks great, Mr. McCoy.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.094
She don't have
to check your work

17:32.128 --> 17:33.795
every step of the way, Len.

17:33.828 --> 17:36.564
I just like my customers
to approve of my work, dear.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.533
Well, she oughta be since
you've been working on her fence

17:38.566 --> 17:40.169
for going on damn-near
six whole days now

17:40.202 --> 17:42.804
while Jerry Unger's been
waitin' on the barn loft

17:42.837 --> 17:43.638
all this while!

17:43.672 --> 17:45.573
I'll get to it, okay?

17:45.607 --> 17:46.876
I'm sure everything
looks great.

17:46.909 --> 17:48.443
Let me just get you your money.

17:54.016 --> 17:57.819
You are
working my last nerve.

17:57.852 --> 17:58.653
You hear me?

18:03.059 --> 18:04.994
This looks
delicious, sweetheart.

18:05.995 --> 18:07.063
Quit it, Tallulah.

18:07.096 --> 18:08.463
Don't do that.

18:09.831 --> 18:11.968
Shh shh shh.

18:14.602 --> 18:15.905
Girls, I don't know how many
times I have to tell you

18:15.938 --> 18:18.174
to put your napkin
in your lap please.

18:18.207 --> 18:20.042
And Maggie, could you
please be a good role model

18:20.076 --> 18:20.943
for your sisters?

18:24.013 --> 18:25.014
Emily.

18:26.315 --> 18:29.919
So, I went by the local
beauty salon today.

18:29.952 --> 18:32.021
Met a woman named Barbara Dell.

18:32.054 --> 18:33.923
Her daughter Clarissa
is in Maggie's homeroom.

18:33.956 --> 18:35.257
Oh, is that right?

18:35.291 --> 18:37.927
And apparently
Clarissa's quite popular.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.262
She can help Maggie
meet some new friends.

18:40.296 --> 18:41.696
Some really nice girls.

18:41.730 --> 18:42.932
Yeah, I've met some of them

18:42.965 --> 18:44.967
and they'll kill
you with kindness.

18:46.002 --> 18:47.937
Stop it, ow.

18:47.970 --> 18:49.939
What, it could be nice
to meet some new friends,

18:49.972 --> 18:51.073
some good girls.

18:52.041 --> 18:53.009
Make the best of the situation.

18:53.042 --> 18:53.943
Girls, please.

18:53.976 --> 18:56.312
Just hope they like me.

18:56.345 --> 18:59.315
Oh honey, they have
no reason not to.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.984
All right, well, let's pray
and eat this delicious meal

19:02.018 --> 19:03.551
that your mother's prepared.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.257
Dear Heavenly Father,

19:09.258 --> 19:11.659
we thank You for this day.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.029
We thank You for this food

19:13.062 --> 19:14.629
and for the preparation of it.

19:14.662 --> 19:16.332
And I ask that You continue
to give us strength

19:16.365 --> 19:18.800
to love others around us.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.635
Thank you for this house
and the many blessings

19:20.668 --> 19:22.271
that You have given us.

19:22.304 --> 19:23.906
We do not deserve them, God.

19:27.609 --> 19:29.078
Who cares, you are.

19:30.913 --> 19:33.049
I was gonna bring 'em
out to your house.

19:33.082 --> 19:33.983
Oh, she'll see,

19:34.016 --> 19:35.717
if an attractive girl like you

19:35.750 --> 19:36.919
came to my house, my wife
Pat will be very jealous.

19:36.952 --> 19:38.120
Oh, say that again.

19:38.154 --> 19:39.321
My wife
Pat will be very...

19:39.355 --> 19:41.856
No, the first part.

19:41.891 --> 19:43.725
An attractive girl like you.

19:43.758 --> 19:44.592
Oh.

19:45.995 --> 19:48.030
An attractive,
adorable girl like you.

19:48.064 --> 19:49.764
Now that's a real man.

19:54.103 --> 19:56.638
Those European types,
they know a thing or two.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.642
Those European types
stay off of farms.

20:00.675 --> 20:01.310
That's for sure.

20:05.014 --> 20:07.049
They steer clear of steer.

20:09.818 --> 20:13.788
They steer clear of
steer.

20:13.822 --> 20:17.359
Hey, I'm talking to you.

20:21.297 --> 20:23.232
Leave it be, Francie.

20:27.036 --> 20:28.938
Leave it be, Francie.

20:35.010 --> 20:37.012
That's enough for you.

20:37.046 --> 20:37.980
Might
be enough for you,

20:38.013 --> 20:40.682
but it sure as shinola
ain't enough for me.

20:40.715 --> 20:45.154
Goddammit, Francie, I
told you that's enough.

20:46.222 --> 20:48.290
Oh, look who
got up out of his chair.

20:49.757 --> 20:50.893
Let me have that.

20:50.926 --> 20:52.261
- Mr. Invisible.
- No, let me have that.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.661
Don't you tell me what to do.

20:53.695 --> 20:54.863
Now I'm not gonna
tell you what...

20:54.897 --> 20:57.066
If I need to grab
that out of you, I will.

20:57.099 --> 20:59.068
Don't you take it.

20:59.101 --> 21:01.070
Hank, I swear to
God, don't take it!

21:55.823 --> 21:58.494
I wish I may, I wish I might,

21:58.527 --> 22:00.996
have the wish I wish tonight.

22:01.030 --> 22:03.731
Let me disappear.
Let me disappear.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.943
Who is it? Who's there?

22:14.910 --> 22:15.710
It's Maggie.

22:17.046 --> 22:18.080
Maggie?

22:18.113 --> 22:18.948
Maggie Richmond.

22:20.883 --> 22:21.951
What are you doing here?

22:23.152 --> 22:24.786
Swimmin'?

22:24.819 --> 22:26.422
But you can't,
this is private.

22:26.455 --> 22:28.057
It's a private place.

22:28.090 --> 22:30.159
Oh, I didn't know.

22:32.061 --> 22:34.463
Well, if it's so private,
what are you doing here?

22:35.898 --> 22:37.499
This is my place.

22:37.533 --> 22:39.068
Oh.

22:39.101 --> 22:41.836
Do you mind sharin'
it for a little while?

22:41.869 --> 22:42.804
Are you naked?

22:43.805 --> 22:44.974
You can't be naked in here.

22:45.007 --> 22:46.475
What if somebody
comes and sees you?

22:46.508 --> 22:48.944
Thought you said this
was a private place.

22:48.978 --> 22:49.979
Who's gonna see me?

22:54.450 --> 22:55.850
You better be careful.

22:56.552 --> 22:58.153
Why?

22:58.187 --> 22:59.888
There's a dead body in here.

23:01.223 --> 23:02.925
Charlotte Owings,
she drowned here.

23:04.093 --> 23:05.294
Suicide, she just
walked right in

23:05.327 --> 23:06.828
until the water
covered her head,

23:06.861 --> 23:08.897
and that's why nobody
comes here anymore.

23:10.599 --> 23:11.799
You come here.

23:19.008 --> 23:20.876
Why'd she kill herself?

23:20.909 --> 23:23.245
People said she
was the town punch.

23:23.279 --> 23:24.779
The town punch?

23:25.981 --> 23:30.019
That she was with other
men that weren't her husband.

23:30.052 --> 23:32.588
But that's, that's
just what they say.

23:32.621 --> 23:34.757
I don't know, I think
she was just sad.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.329
Maybe I should
kill myself then.

23:41.863 --> 23:44.133
Lie down at the bottom
there with Charlotte Owens.

23:44.166 --> 23:46.302
It's not funny.

23:46.335 --> 23:48.337
She was really sad,
she wasn't like you.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.240
What do you know about me?

23:54.610 --> 23:56.345
What?

23:56.378 --> 23:57.946
Someone's got my foot.

23:57.980 --> 24:00.349
- No, they do not.
- No, I'm serious, Iris.

24:00.382 --> 24:02.518
Someone's got my foot.

24:03.419 --> 24:04.253
Maggie!

24:05.654 --> 24:06.889
Maggie?

24:08.891 --> 24:11.360
Maggie, where'd you go?

24:11.393 --> 24:13.062
Maggie, there's roots under
here, you could get stuck.

24:13.095 --> 24:13.996
That's not funny.

24:16.899 --> 24:20.269
Maggie?

24:28.610 --> 24:29.912
That wasn't funny.

24:29.945 --> 24:31.213
You should have
seen your face,

24:31.246 --> 24:32.648
it was hilarious.

24:32.681 --> 24:34.383
You're no better
than the rest of 'em.

24:34.416 --> 24:37.319
Think you're big by stepping
on somebody else is disgusting.

24:38.654 --> 24:40.222
Wait, Iris I was kidding.

24:41.924 --> 24:42.991
Please, don't go.

24:44.460 --> 24:45.860
Please, we can share it.

24:50.099 --> 24:50.933
Please.

24:59.141 --> 25:00.676
And then they wanted
me to be a model,

25:00.709 --> 25:02.644
but my dad didn't want
me to get spoiled.

25:02.678 --> 25:04.680
You know he's worked with
all those famous actresses,

25:04.713 --> 25:06.382
and sees how spoiled they get,

25:06.415 --> 25:08.617
but I did take a few
modeling classes.

25:08.650 --> 25:10.552
Do you wanna know
how to sell lips?

25:10.586 --> 25:11.620
Sell lips?

25:11.653 --> 25:13.455
Yeah, you know if you're
a model for lipstick,

25:13.489 --> 25:15.491
you have to know
how to sell lips.

25:15.524 --> 25:18.961
It's like this.

25:20.195 --> 25:21.930
That looks awful.

25:21.964 --> 25:23.999
What do you mean?
That's how you do it.

25:24.032 --> 25:24.666
You try.

25:26.001 --> 25:26.635
You're a liar.

25:28.437 --> 25:29.271
What?

25:31.006 --> 25:32.007
You lie.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.409
You did it today in chemistry,

25:33.442 --> 25:35.677
your daddy doesn't
work for Life magazine.

25:35.711 --> 25:37.312
Yes he does.

25:37.346 --> 25:38.313
You didn't take no
modeling classes, neither.

25:38.347 --> 25:39.181
I did too.

25:40.482 --> 25:41.984
What do you know about me?

25:43.152 --> 25:44.686
Nothin'. I don't know,

25:44.720 --> 25:47.389
maybe you just want
people to like you.

25:47.423 --> 25:48.624
Why do you think that?

25:49.658 --> 25:51.226
You wish people would like you?

25:53.262 --> 25:54.930
I don't care if
people like me.

25:57.633 --> 25:58.634
You don't know me.

26:00.002 --> 26:01.437
You don't know
anything about me.

26:02.704 --> 26:03.505
Except, you know what?

26:03.539 --> 26:04.373
You're right.

26:05.741 --> 26:07.075
I am a liar.

26:07.743 --> 26:09.211
I don't want to share
this place with you.

26:09.244 --> 26:10.145
You can have it.

27:02.264 --> 27:03.298
Who were you with?

27:03.332 --> 27:04.166
No one.

27:07.069 --> 27:08.303
Maggie?

27:08.337 --> 27:10.272
Grace, get back inside.

27:10.305 --> 27:12.474
Honey, it's late.

27:12.508 --> 27:14.142
Wouldn't it be best
if we all came in?

27:14.176 --> 27:16.144
Grace, get back inside.

27:18.347 --> 27:19.181
Alright.

27:24.119 --> 27:26.021
I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

27:27.289 --> 27:29.791
Who were you with?

27:29.825 --> 27:31.226
I was swimming alone.

27:37.633 --> 27:40.068
I left
my job for you.

27:40.102 --> 27:41.436
I moved my family.

27:42.738 --> 27:44.406
You already told me that.

27:46.208 --> 27:47.609
Next time we're
gonna go without you.

27:47.643 --> 27:48.710
Do you understand me?

27:49.845 --> 27:51.513
I told you it
won't happen again.

27:53.582 --> 27:55.117
Get inside and dry off.

27:56.218 --> 28:01.223
Now.

28:58.847 --> 29:00.349
What's that bruise?

29:05.955 --> 29:08.256
How come they call
you "Stinky Drawers"?

29:37.419 --> 29:38.487
She might be from the city,

29:38.520 --> 29:39.755
but the girl needs schooling.

29:46.929 --> 29:51.233
I swear, this damn bra.

29:51.266 --> 29:53.468
It's a blessing and
a curse, ain't it?

29:53.502 --> 29:54.302
Forget it.

29:54.336 --> 29:55.170
Maggie?

29:56.605 --> 29:58.373
Now don't worry if you
can't do the splits

29:58.407 --> 29:59.474
in the tryouts, okay?

29:59.508 --> 30:00.877
They won't hold it against you

30:00.910 --> 30:02.945
as long as you have
flexibility in other areas.

30:02.979 --> 30:04.947
Like, there's flexibility
besides the splits.

30:04.981 --> 30:06.883
And you oughta know, Hattie.

30:06.916 --> 30:09.718
Now you don't have to
be a bitch, Clarissa.

30:09.751 --> 30:12.854
You have to come to the
after-game dance tomorrow night.

30:12.889 --> 30:15.757
Oh yeah, it's a good time
to nail down a prom date.

30:15.791 --> 30:17.994
Let me tell you, pickin's
are gettin' mighty slim.

30:18.027 --> 30:20.762
Todd Ingram and Jerry Junior
are already off the market.

30:20.796 --> 30:22.230
Already?

30:22.264 --> 30:24.000
Yes, there's an air
of hysteria building.

30:24.033 --> 30:27.302
I'm not worried but, Maggie,

30:27.335 --> 30:28.804
this is a crucial time for you.

30:28.837 --> 30:30.672
We can't afford to be lazy.

30:30.706 --> 30:33.308
- You could get left at home.
- You wouldn't want that.

30:33.341 --> 30:35.277
Certainly not.

30:35.310 --> 30:39.381
And Maggie, we know
you're new and all.

30:39.414 --> 30:41.884
There's no real
way you could know.

30:41.918 --> 30:42.919
But it is essential you

30:42.952 --> 30:45.287
stay away from Iris Deerborne.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.989
She's
an untouchable.

30:47.023 --> 30:48.356
An untouchable?

30:48.390 --> 30:51.027
Like India? They're
the lower class.

30:51.060 --> 30:54.262
They bathe in their
own body waste.

30:54.296 --> 30:56.398
Oh Rhonda, please
not before lunch.

30:56.431 --> 30:57.332
That's disgusting.

30:57.365 --> 30:58.834
I'm sure you'll
still be able to eat.

30:59.735 --> 31:01.037
Clarissa Dell, I
will have you know

31:01.070 --> 31:02.504
I've lost 5 pounds this month.

31:02.537 --> 31:04.006
Yeah, you look swell.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.007
But if you're not
careful you'll have it

31:05.041 --> 31:06.575
back on by Tuesday.

31:06.608 --> 31:08.510
Songbirds have to set
an example, Hattie.

31:08.543 --> 31:10.378
Remember we talked
about self-control?

31:10.412 --> 31:12.014
Oh my lord.

31:13.381 --> 31:17.352
The point is, being
seen with Iris Deerborne

31:17.385 --> 31:19.254
is social suicide.

31:20.489 --> 31:22.925
As opposed to suicide, which
wouldn't be as embarrassing?

31:24.927 --> 31:25.761
Never mind.

31:32.367 --> 31:33.568
How's my form?

31:33.602 --> 31:34.503
It needs work.

31:39.108 --> 31:41.476
Do you think your
daddy would photograph

31:41.510 --> 31:43.946
any of the games if
you made the squad?

31:45.413 --> 31:46.414
If I made the squad.

31:46.448 --> 31:47.282
Okay!

32:21.650 --> 32:22.784
This thing seat two?

32:24.486 --> 32:25.988
Uh, not easy.

32:28.557 --> 32:31.459
I never said I
was easy, young man.

32:31.493 --> 32:34.663
Mrs. Deerborne, you know
I didn't mean it like that.

32:34.696 --> 32:35.932
I know what you meant.

32:35.965 --> 32:37.666
How 'bout we go for
a quick spin anyways.

32:38.935 --> 32:40.069
I really should
be gettin' home.

32:40.102 --> 32:41.603
My grandma's waitin' on me.

32:41.636 --> 32:43.371
Okay, well let's just
make it a quick spin.

32:43.405 --> 32:46.909
The wind's already messed
up my hair.

32:48.677 --> 32:50.378
I don't know if Mr. Deerborne
would approve of that.

32:50.412 --> 32:52.581
Hank? Hank's out
in the back forty

32:52.614 --> 32:54.083
moonin' on his cows.

32:54.116 --> 32:54.951
C'mon.

32:54.984 --> 32:56.651
I paid for this thing.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.753
Might as well get
a ride out of it.

32:58.787 --> 33:00.422
Let's go.

33:00.455 --> 33:01.958
Mrs. Deerborne, I really
should go. I'm sorry.

33:01.991 --> 33:03.125
No you don't.

33:03.159 --> 33:04.559
No you don't gotta go.

33:04.593 --> 33:06.128
Now just stop right there

33:06.162 --> 33:08.697
and just give me a ride.

33:08.730 --> 33:09.966
No.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.100
Just 'cause your mama
went and drowned herself

33:11.133 --> 33:13.869
don't mean you gotta be scared
of every woman you know.

33:14.870 --> 33:15.972
No.

33:16.005 --> 33:17.706
Oh honey, I'm sorry.

33:17.739 --> 33:18.673
Oh!

33:19.208 --> 33:21.043
Oh I'm so sorry.

33:21.077 --> 33:24.546
Goddammit Iris.

33:25.614 --> 33:26.949
She just sees a
good-lookin' boy,

33:26.983 --> 33:29.018
and she just falls to pieces.

33:32.687 --> 33:33.923
Let the dog get it.

33:33.956 --> 33:35.423
I'll take it out
of your allowance.

33:42.831 --> 33:44.699
Take the egg money
out of my wages.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.460
Iris?

34:12.494 --> 34:15.197
You awake? Baby, you awake?

34:15.231 --> 34:16.498
What, Mama?

34:17.599 --> 34:18.466
Baby?

34:18.500 --> 34:21.203
I want you to try
this dress on, okay?

34:21.237 --> 34:22.871
- Mama, no.
- Let me tell you something,

34:22.905 --> 34:24.506
This is your boy catcher.

34:25.807 --> 34:28.210
You just don't know how to
catch a boy. That is all.

34:28.244 --> 34:30.012
And I'm gonna help you, okay?

34:30.913 --> 34:32.580
- Now get up.
- Mama, please.

34:32.614 --> 34:33.815
Get up baby, now c'mon
c'mon c'mon. Get up. Get up.

34:35.184 --> 34:36.685
I'm tellin' you, I
am sick and tired

34:36.718 --> 34:39.587
of people in this town
talkin' down to you.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.123
I'm just sick and tired of it.

34:42.258 --> 34:43.825
No, Mama, don't, Mama.

34:43.858 --> 34:44.927
I'm gonna help you.

34:46.262 --> 34:48.830
When I was your age, I
could get any boy I wanted.

34:48.863 --> 34:51.267
I had to beat 'em
off with a stick.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.601
If I hadn't gotten pregnant,
who knows where I might be?

34:53.635 --> 34:54.437
Mama, I wanna go to sleep.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.105
C'mon sweetheart,
let's get up.

34:56.138 --> 34:59.175
And I am not gonna
let you use up your chance.

34:59.208 --> 35:01.676
No ma'am. No ma'am.

35:02.744 --> 35:04.779
You are not.

35:04.813 --> 35:06.715
Let's take a look at you now.

35:12.854 --> 35:14.856
Baby,
you look so pretty.

35:17.226 --> 35:19.161
You look so pretty.

35:19.195 --> 35:21.763
Oh,
c'mon baby, let's go.

35:21.796 --> 35:23.265
Let's get out of
her room, honey.

35:23.299 --> 35:25.700
I'm not trying to
make a problem, baby.

35:25.734 --> 35:27.236
- I know, c'mon.
- I'm not trying to make a problem.

35:27.269 --> 35:30.605
Come here, come
here. C'mon. Let's go.

35:32.975 --> 35:34.542
I'm sorry, baby.

36:00.369 --> 36:02.304
Are you okay?

36:02.338 --> 36:06.808
Don't come near me.

36:13.815 --> 36:16.818
I just wanna make sure
you're okay, and then I'll go.

36:16.851 --> 36:18.287
No, please get away.

36:19.687 --> 36:21.057
It's okay.

36:21.090 --> 36:22.024
Get back!

36:24.659 --> 36:25.660
It's okay.

36:27.897 --> 36:29.165
I wet myself.

36:30.399 --> 36:31.800
What?

36:31.833 --> 36:37.273
I wet myself.

36:37.306 --> 36:38.140
Oh.

36:51.187 --> 36:53.355
My dad works for
Agricultural Quarterly.

36:57.393 --> 36:59.295
He doesn't work
for Life magazine.

37:01.796 --> 37:05.167
He doesn't take pictures
of Marilyn Monroe.

37:06.701 --> 37:09.838
He takes pictures of
drainage pipes and cow shit.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.777
I also could never be a model.

37:15.810 --> 37:18.680
I'm way too
flat-chested.

37:21.917 --> 37:24.752
They also never interviewed
me to be an airline hostess.

37:26.388 --> 37:28.190
I could never be
an airline hostess.

37:29.325 --> 37:30.993
Why not?

37:31.026 --> 37:32.094
I get airsick.

37:34.796 --> 37:36.764
The last time I
was on an airplane,

37:36.798 --> 37:39.935
I threw up my Ovaltine
all over the aisles.

37:41.170 --> 37:43.038
and the airline hostess
made me clean it up.

37:45.174 --> 37:46.774
They're all first-class bitches.

37:54.483 --> 37:56.385
They call me "Stinky Drawers"

37:59.155 --> 38:01.656
'cause I've got a weak bladder.

38:04.726 --> 38:06.395
And I hate this dress.

38:09.398 --> 38:10.900
I hate this dress!

38:34.490 --> 38:36.025
Here you go.

38:36.058 --> 38:37.026
Thank you.

38:45.301 --> 38:48.404
You've got a great arm.

38:48.437 --> 38:51.173
But you just need to work
on your aim a little bit.

38:51.207 --> 38:52.508
I learned this
really great trick

38:52.541 --> 38:54.776
from my favorite
southpaw, Bud Daley.

38:54.809 --> 38:58.180
So, if you point your free hand

38:58.214 --> 38:59.781
where you want the rock to go,

38:59.814 --> 39:03.118
and then with your
hand that has the rock,

39:03.152 --> 39:04.386
you just chuck it.

39:06.188 --> 39:07.022
You try.

39:09.191 --> 39:12.061
And Deerborne takes the mound.

39:12.094 --> 39:14.330
This rookie's ready
to throw some heat.

39:14.363 --> 39:16.764
Here comes the windup.

39:16.798 --> 39:20.835
And it's clocked at
90 miles per hour,

39:20.868 --> 39:22.972
it's a strikeout!

39:23.005 --> 39:25.140
Oh my gosh! It worked!

39:25.174 --> 39:26.442
I told you it works.

39:26.475 --> 39:29.844
Bud Daley never fails.

39:29.878 --> 39:30.845
Ah!

39:36.986 --> 39:37.785
What'd I tell you?

39:37.819 --> 39:39.088
Oh my gosh!

39:39.121 --> 39:39.922
Not so bad.

39:40.589 --> 39:41.890
Not so bad.

39:45.594 --> 39:47.795
You don't have to
talk to me at school.

39:49.565 --> 39:53.435
It's 'cause of my parents,
the cheerleading and stuff.

39:54.836 --> 39:55.904
I understand.

39:58.073 --> 39:58.907
They hate me.

39:59.975 --> 40:00.808
Who?

40:01.910 --> 40:02.745
My parents.

40:05.847 --> 40:07.815
Sometimes I wonder
if they even see me.

40:09.585 --> 40:11.920
Or they're lookin' at
what they wish I was.

40:15.857 --> 40:18.060
How could they not see you?

40:24.099 --> 40:24.933
Let me pull you.

40:54.963 --> 40:56.831
Go see who's honkin'.

41:08.177 --> 41:09.178
It's Maggie.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.881
Who's Maggie?

41:12.915 --> 41:13.549
My friend.

41:39.375 --> 41:41.043
Thanks for picking me up
for school.

41:41.076 --> 41:43.112
Oh, you shouldn't thank me,

41:43.145 --> 41:44.046
'cause we're ditching.

42:16.512 --> 42:17.613
Maggie?

42:17.646 --> 42:19.114
Yeah?

42:19.148 --> 42:21.683
I think I'm too big
for your mom's stuff.

42:21.717 --> 42:24.386
That's how it's
supposed to look, Iris.

42:30.559 --> 42:31.960
Is your bust popping out?

42:31.994 --> 42:33.262
A little.

42:33.295 --> 42:34.596
Then it's right.

42:36.498 --> 42:38.500
Oh.

43:02.558 --> 43:03.559
I'm legally blind.

43:04.693 --> 43:06.228
Well then you
won't get arrested.

43:16.205 --> 43:17.506
Just a little dab.

43:22.778 --> 43:23.579
Beautiful.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.549
And this shadow, Dusky Mauve,

43:29.051 --> 43:30.385
is complimentary if you purchase

43:30.419 --> 43:32.588
the Sun Kissed body makeup.

43:37.726 --> 43:40.629
And now, for the
finishing touch.

43:40.662 --> 43:42.966
This is Captive Rouge.

43:47.769 --> 43:50.539
I imagine wearing this
while on a deserted island

43:50.572 --> 43:51.473
with Bobby Darin.

43:53.842 --> 43:55.744
This is the perfect
moment to sell lips.

44:17.566 --> 44:20.102
Did you see the
way he came barreling in

44:20.135 --> 44:21.570
and shooting that gun?

44:21.603 --> 44:23.839
That was the craziest
thing I've ever seen.

44:23.872 --> 44:26.441
I've never seen anyone
shoot a gun that fast.

44:26.475 --> 44:28.076
Steve McQueen was,

44:28.844 --> 44:30.445
he was nice.

44:30.479 --> 44:31.613
What?

44:31.647 --> 44:32.748
He was what?

44:32.781 --> 44:35.317
He was nice.

44:40.122 --> 44:41.423
Now I can't see anything.

44:41.456 --> 44:43.058
We should get you new glasses.

44:43.759 --> 44:45.394
My mom will never go for that.

44:45.427 --> 44:48.263
She always says, don't
fix it if it ain't broke.

44:48.297 --> 44:49.798
Iris, it's broke.

44:50.699 --> 44:52.267
Would you look at that?

44:56.438 --> 44:57.306
It's beautiful.

44:58.440 --> 44:59.541
It's meant for you.

45:01.376 --> 45:02.411
You should try it on.

45:05.681 --> 45:07.382
I'd just ruin it.

45:09.284 --> 45:12.087
That's why mama
never buys me anything nice.

45:22.264 --> 45:22.864
Let's go.

45:22.899 --> 45:24.700
Not yet.

45:30.505 --> 45:31.640
Iris.

45:45.721 --> 45:46.655
Dr. Kay?

45:46.688 --> 45:47.924
Yes dear?

45:47.957 --> 45:50.592
Do you have Iris
Deerborne's results?

45:50.626 --> 45:51.560
I do.

45:51.593 --> 45:53.428
Well I'm her sister, Margot.

45:53.462 --> 45:55.330
Could you tell me
what's wrong with her?

45:57.366 --> 46:00.836
Hank Deerborne's only got
one child so far as I know.

46:00.869 --> 46:02.939
Well I'm, I'm her friend.

46:02.972 --> 46:06.174
As I told her mother
many times before,

46:06.208 --> 46:07.843
I didn't find anything
wrong with Iris.

46:08.878 --> 46:10.278
Well then how come she,

46:10.312 --> 46:11.480
how come she keeps
wetting herself?

46:11.513 --> 46:12.447
It's all up here.

46:13.482 --> 46:14.349
Psychosomatic.

46:16.785 --> 46:17.619
Dr. Kay?

46:19.956 --> 46:22.624
Maybe this time there is
something wrong with her.

46:40.742 --> 46:42.210
That's Clarissa Dell's car.

46:44.246 --> 46:44.881
Oh.

46:47.582 --> 46:49.518
We can come
back another time.

46:52.254 --> 46:53.789
Okay.

47:14.743 --> 47:15.744
Maggie, no.

47:34.629 --> 47:35.430
Hi.

47:39.468 --> 47:41.336
Iris Deerborne, is that you?

47:41.369 --> 47:42.604
Hi Hazel.

47:42.637 --> 47:43.839
I've never seen
you all dolled up.

47:43.872 --> 47:45.707
I hardly recognized ya.
What can I do for you?

47:45.741 --> 47:48.410
More like a mud
frog in a sweater set.

47:50.880 --> 47:51.713
What'd she say?

47:53.049 --> 47:54.050
Actually, you seem busy.

47:54.083 --> 47:54.884
No, not at all, not at all.

47:54.917 --> 47:56.785
Clarissa and Rhonda
are just drying

47:56.818 --> 47:58.820
and Hattie needs to soak.

47:58.854 --> 48:00.957
I've been soaking
for 30 minutes.

48:00.990 --> 48:02.491
You have
rough calluses, dear.

48:02.524 --> 48:03.993
Come on over.

48:04.026 --> 48:06.028
We need to get Iris ready
for the after-game dance.

48:06.062 --> 48:06.896
We do?

48:06.929 --> 48:08.797
What's a dance
without its wallflower?

48:10.432 --> 48:11.633
You know, I don't
think I put enough

48:11.666 --> 48:13.936
permanent solution in your hair.

48:13.970 --> 48:15.704
I'll be right with you
as soon as I figure out

48:15.737 --> 48:17.839
what to do with all
of Iris' natural curl.

48:25.982 --> 48:28.316
I told you she
was an untouchable.

48:29.484 --> 48:31.653
Shoot, well I guess
I'd better warn my dad.

48:32.854 --> 48:33.990
Why?

48:34.023 --> 48:36.591
I know it sounds crazy, but

48:36.625 --> 48:39.327
he's photographing
her for the magazine.

48:39.361 --> 48:40.562
For Life Magazine?

48:40.595 --> 48:41.763
Mmhmm.

48:41.797 --> 48:43.799
Somehow he got this
idea in his head

48:43.832 --> 48:46.035
that he needs to find the
heart of the Heartland

48:46.068 --> 48:50.072
for his next piece so
he thinks Iris is deep,

48:51.506 --> 48:54.309
as deep and far reaching
as the plains of Oklahoma.

48:56.545 --> 48:57.813
You look a picture.

48:59.982 --> 49:01.550
Let's get started.

49:48.097 --> 49:49.364
Is that me?

49:52.567 --> 49:54.070
That's you, hon.

49:56.438 --> 49:58.007
I hardly recognize myself.

49:59.141 --> 50:01.409
Clarissa Dell,
eat your heart out.

50:01.443 --> 50:04.512
I have a feeling
she will.

50:05.647 --> 50:06.615
What about you?

50:07.549 --> 50:09.085
Me?

50:09.118 --> 50:11.586
What can we do
with that gorgeous mane?

50:11.620 --> 50:16.158
God.

50:16.192 --> 50:19.161
It's a mess.

50:21.463 --> 50:22.731
What a
beautiful color you have.

50:22.764 --> 50:24.532
Thank you.

50:28.237 --> 50:30.739
Is this your husband?

50:30.772 --> 50:31.740
How did he die?

50:32.909 --> 50:34.743
If it's not too
rude of me to ask.

50:35.878 --> 50:37.479
No, it's not rude at all, hon.

50:39.148 --> 50:40.815
He died in the Korean War.

50:41.716 --> 50:44.519
Oh, I'm so sorry.

50:46.554 --> 50:47.189
Me too.

50:54.931 --> 50:56.232
Um, you know what?

50:56.265 --> 50:58.034
Um, I actually don't even
know what I'm wearing,

50:58.067 --> 50:59.834
but thank you though.

51:02.138 --> 51:05.041
Oh the outfit does
pick the hair style.

51:05.074 --> 51:07.475
Mmhmm, Iris, let's go.

51:07.509 --> 51:08.543
All right.

51:08.576 --> 51:09.211
Thanks, Hazel.

51:10.179 --> 51:11.846
It was my pleasure.

51:12.847 --> 51:14.150
You all have fun.

52:19.248 --> 52:21.516
Who is this angel before me?

52:33.262 --> 52:34.964
What did you do to yourself?

52:36.298 --> 52:38.234
Maggie gave me
a beauty makeover.

52:38.267 --> 52:40.269
And I'd say she
did a mighty fine job.

52:40.302 --> 52:41.270
Where'd you get
the money for it?

52:41.303 --> 52:42.204
We don't have that kind of money

52:42.238 --> 52:43.638
just lying around the house.

52:43.671 --> 52:44.672
It's all right if
she uses a little

52:44.706 --> 52:45.941
of her own allowance on herself.

52:45.975 --> 52:47.776
Where
are you glasses?

52:47.809 --> 52:49.979
I took 'em off, but
it's just for tonight.

52:50.012 --> 52:52.281
I wanna go to the
after-game dance.

52:52.314 --> 52:53.681
You can't go outside
without your glasses.

52:53.715 --> 52:55.351
You can't see a foot
in front of you.

52:55.384 --> 52:56.584
I'll be careful...

52:56.618 --> 52:57.486
Francie, lay off.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.355
Don't tell me how
to mind my child.

52:59.388 --> 53:01.257
Edith says this Maggie's
mom drives around

53:01.290 --> 53:03.359
in a spanking new car.

53:03.392 --> 53:05.261
She gets her clothes from Dior.

53:06.728 --> 53:08.898
So what are you gonna
do when this Maggie says

53:08.931 --> 53:10.366
she don't like the
way Iris smells?

53:10.399 --> 53:13.169
Francie, leave it be.

53:13.202 --> 53:14.203
Now I mean it.

53:16.405 --> 53:18.773
That is just like
the two of you,

53:18.807 --> 53:20.608
just ganging up on me.

53:23.412 --> 53:27.349
Honey, you go on and go to
that dance now, all right?

53:29.185 --> 53:31.287
You go on and you
enjoy yourself.

53:31.320 --> 53:32.321
You look beautiful.

53:33.389 --> 53:36.624
Thank you.

54:00.883 --> 54:03.419
Hey, well
hurry up and get ready.

54:03.452 --> 54:04.686
You're gonna be late.

54:07.056 --> 54:07.890
I'm not going.

54:09.291 --> 54:11.026
What do you mean
you're not going?

54:12.361 --> 54:14.330
It doesn't matter
if I change my hair

54:14.363 --> 54:16.332
or I have different clothes or

54:17.466 --> 54:19.368
a different face, I'm still me.

54:19.401 --> 54:21.403
I'm still the same
girl I always was.

54:22.304 --> 54:23.239
Iris...

54:23.272 --> 54:24.273
No, you shouldn't miss it.

54:24.306 --> 54:25.107
You should go.

54:26.408 --> 54:28.277
I'm gonna be with
you the whole time

54:29.777 --> 54:31.679
and anyone who doesn't like
it can go straight to hell.

54:34.483 --> 54:35.717
I can't.

54:36.418 --> 54:38.387
Night, Maggie.

55:36.412 --> 55:38.447
I don't care about your help.

55:38.480 --> 55:43.085
Well, Mads says that we
are beautiful young ladies.

55:43.118 --> 55:45.387
You do
pay her for a reason.

55:46.488 --> 55:48.157
Clarissa.

56:01.136 --> 56:02.905
There she is.

56:02.938 --> 56:05.140
Calm down,
Hattie, she's not Christ risen.

56:05.174 --> 56:06.542
You made the team!

56:06.575 --> 56:07.943
You're an official songbird.

56:07.977 --> 56:09.545
Which makes you one of us.

56:09.578 --> 56:12.214
Great. What
happened to your hair?

56:13.082 --> 56:14.450
Never mind that.

56:14.483 --> 56:16.151
Okay, our first
official order of business

56:16.185 --> 56:19.054
for our new songbird is
to find her a prom date.

56:19.088 --> 56:21.490
Oh! Brian
Emerich asked me.

56:21.523 --> 56:22.558
The midget.

56:22.591 --> 56:23.959
He is not.

56:23.993 --> 56:26.028
He
comes up to her bust.

56:26.061 --> 56:27.162
That's only
if I'm wearing heels.

56:27.196 --> 56:29.298
Don't be so sensitive, Hattie.

56:29.331 --> 56:30.933
Anyway, we all have
football players,

56:30.966 --> 56:32.834
but I think there's
one left for you.

56:32.867 --> 56:34.270
Over there.

56:34.303 --> 56:37.006
But we have to wait 10
minutes before we approach.

56:37.039 --> 56:38.240
Clarissa says,

56:38.274 --> 56:39.508
it's never good
to look too eager.

56:39.541 --> 56:40.876
I do say that.

56:42.544 --> 56:45.881
Well, I wouldn't
want to look too eager.

56:51.053 --> 56:52.087
What are these?

56:53.522 --> 56:56.058
I found them in
your coat pocket.

56:56.091 --> 56:58.193
Pills for my bladder.

56:58.227 --> 56:59.962
Maggie took me to Dr. Kay.

56:59.995 --> 57:00.862
Maggie?

57:02.164 --> 57:03.299
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

57:04.366 --> 57:05.968
She's my friend, mama.

57:06.001 --> 57:07.236
Some friend.

57:08.404 --> 57:10.139
You know what these are?

57:10.172 --> 57:11.540
They're
pills for my bladder.

57:11.573 --> 57:12.975
They're sugar pills.

57:13.876 --> 57:15.044
That's all they are.

57:16.278 --> 57:17.079
Sugar.

57:17.980 --> 57:19.348
Mama, give me my pills.

57:20.549 --> 57:22.817
Honey, you think this
girl is your friend,

57:24.653 --> 57:25.853
I'm the one that knows better.

57:25.888 --> 57:27.556
I'm the one that
takes care of you

57:27.589 --> 57:29.191
and I can tell you,

57:29.224 --> 57:32.494
I would never ever
give you sugar pills.

57:32.528 --> 57:33.595
Stop it.

57:33.629 --> 57:35.264
No, you do not need these.

57:35.297 --> 57:37.900
You do not need these,
these are no good for you.

57:39.902 --> 57:42.404
You keep taking these and
you will still wet yourself

57:42.438 --> 57:45.840
and that girl, Maggie will
be having one big old laugh.

57:53.582 --> 57:55.184
Mama, I haven't wet myself.

57:59.655 --> 58:00.923
I'm dry.

58:21.510 --> 58:22.611
Well alright then.

58:23.645 --> 58:26.115
You go on to that
dance and you have fun.

58:28.617 --> 58:30.285
Oh don't forget your candy.

58:51.039 --> 58:55.043
Craig Butler, this is
Maggie Richmond.

58:55.077 --> 58:56.712
She's just as pretty
as y'all said she is.

58:56.745 --> 58:58.213
She's right here.

58:58.247 --> 58:59.548
Oh she's feisty too.

59:00.449 --> 59:01.283
I like that.

59:03.085 --> 59:04.953
Don't touch.

59:04.987 --> 59:06.321
If you two go together,

59:06.355 --> 59:09.057
then we can take
yearbook photos together.

59:09.091 --> 59:10.726
Maybe Maggie's
daddy can take it.

59:10.759 --> 59:12.361
Oh, he's pretty busy.

59:12.394 --> 59:14.363
Well you
can at least ask.

59:16.732 --> 59:19.735
So where are you
boys taking us for dinner?

59:19.768 --> 59:22.604
Oh, we were
thinking Beef and Chips.

59:22.638 --> 59:26.642
Well that's
disgusting, Craig Butler.

59:26.675 --> 59:27.676
Excuse me.

59:31.246 --> 59:32.748
Who is that?

59:32.781 --> 59:33.982
I don't know.

59:35.150 --> 59:35.751
Maybe she's new?

59:35.784 --> 59:37.753
That's Iris Deerborne.

59:37.786 --> 59:39.555
No it's not.

59:39.588 --> 59:41.023
Yes it is, can't
you smell her?

59:43.559 --> 59:45.194
You came.

59:45.227 --> 59:46.595
I came.

59:46.628 --> 59:49.431
I love that you came.

1:00:15.457 --> 1:00:18.327
Once a pig, always a pig.

1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:19.294
Hmm.

1:00:19.328 --> 1:00:20.362
Definitely.

1:00:23.165 --> 1:00:26.201
We've got to cure Maggie
of her Pygmalion complex.

1:00:29.338 --> 1:00:30.339
Pygmalion.

1:00:31.607 --> 1:00:34.276
Pig, we read it Sophomore Lit.

1:00:35.577 --> 1:00:38.580
God, Rhonda, you're so dense.

1:00:42.684 --> 1:00:44.686
Please don't stay
here on my account.

1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:45.754
Go have fun.

1:00:45.787 --> 1:00:47.089
I am having fun.

1:00:51.660 --> 1:00:53.562
- I should go home.
- Don't you dare.

1:00:55.330 --> 1:00:56.698
Hey, Iris.

1:01:00.202 --> 1:01:02.671
That gorgeous boy
just said hey to you.

1:01:03.672 --> 1:01:05.440
I know.

1:01:05.474 --> 1:01:07.175
Why don't you say hey back?

1:01:09.578 --> 1:01:10.412
I can't.

1:01:11.380 --> 1:01:12.414
Why not?

1:01:13.515 --> 1:01:15.784
Because I might throw up.

1:01:17.486 --> 1:01:18.120
Oh.

1:01:22.190 --> 1:01:23.492
You know what?

1:01:24.660 --> 1:01:26.395
I think I will go have some fun.

1:01:28.397 --> 1:01:29.598
Wait, Maggie.

1:01:29.631 --> 1:01:30.432
No, wait.

1:01:30.465 --> 1:01:31.466
Maggie?

1:01:38.340 --> 1:01:39.708
Did you have to pay?

1:01:40.910 --> 1:01:42.511
What?

1:01:42.544 --> 1:01:44.813
Those eggs that we broke.

1:01:44.846 --> 1:01:47.349
Did you have to pay for them?

1:01:47.382 --> 1:01:49.117
No.

1:01:49.151 --> 1:01:51.353
Oh, good.

1:01:51.386 --> 1:01:53.589
Otherwise, I was going
to have to pay you back.

1:01:54.690 --> 1:01:59.294
Well, you don't, so.

1:02:01.496 --> 1:02:03.599
You look different
without your glasses.

1:02:05.233 --> 1:02:06.635
I'm just going to have
to put them right back on.

1:02:06.668 --> 1:02:07.469
I can't see a thing.

1:02:08.870 --> 1:02:11.273
No, no, you look
good with them on.

1:02:11.306 --> 1:02:12.140
But...

1:02:14.209 --> 1:02:15.544
I don't know.

1:02:15.577 --> 1:02:16.879
I guess without them you just,

1:02:18.614 --> 1:02:21.249
I don't know, you look
all grown-up or something.

1:02:22.952 --> 1:02:23.785
Oh.

1:02:27.789 --> 1:02:30.225
Do you wanna dance?

1:02:30.258 --> 1:02:31.293
What?

1:02:31.326 --> 1:02:33.428
Do you wanna dance with me?

1:02:36.832 --> 1:02:37.633
No.

1:02:39.534 --> 1:02:40.335
Oh.

1:02:42.204 --> 1:02:43.238
I can't dance.

1:02:45.807 --> 1:02:46.909
Neither can I.

1:02:49.611 --> 1:02:51.513
Then why do you
wanna dance with me?

1:02:54.383 --> 1:02:58.587
Because Iris, you're
the only girl in this town

1:02:58.620 --> 1:03:00.822
who's not phony.

1:03:09.431 --> 1:03:10.265
Come on,

1:03:11.566 --> 1:03:12.401
please?

1:03:41.730 --> 1:03:42.531
Hey.

1:03:43.498 --> 1:03:46.868
Jeff Owings is dancing
with Iris Deerborne.

1:03:46.903 --> 1:03:47.803
Shut your mouth!

1:03:59.381 --> 1:04:00.515
Maybe she is deep?

1:04:38.620 --> 1:04:39.454
Hey, Iris.

1:04:43.092 --> 1:04:43.926
Hello?

1:04:45.527 --> 1:04:50.532
Today we are creating
magnesium oxide in our labs.

1:04:51.633 --> 1:04:53.668
Alice and Eddie, station one.

1:04:53.702 --> 1:04:56.338
Clarissa and
Johnna, station two.

1:04:56.371 --> 1:04:58.306
I don't see why we
gotta change partners

1:04:58.340 --> 1:05:00.475
just 'cause we have someone new.

1:05:00.509 --> 1:05:03.045
Well, that's
not very friendly, Clarissa.

1:05:03.079 --> 1:05:05.547
Just who is Johnna
supposed to work with?

1:05:05.580 --> 1:05:06.681
How should I know?

1:05:06.715 --> 1:05:08.084
Just when I get used to Iris

1:05:08.117 --> 1:05:10.652
you gotta change everything.

1:05:10.685 --> 1:05:12.721
Kim and Jack, station three.

1:05:12.754 --> 1:05:15.724
Charlie and Scott, station four.

1:05:15.757 --> 1:05:19.028
Katherine and
Mona, station five.

1:05:19.061 --> 1:05:21.898
Tripp and Richard, station six.

1:06:00.735 --> 1:06:01.636
You seen Clarissa?

1:06:04.706 --> 1:06:05.674
No.

1:06:11.780 --> 1:06:14.583
She said she might ditch
third and go to the drive-up.

1:06:17.987 --> 1:06:18.921
Over here!

1:06:20.957 --> 1:06:21.756
Oh, my God.

1:06:21.790 --> 1:06:22.992
It's hot.

1:06:23.025 --> 1:06:24.726
Why did y'all have to
sit in the sun for?

1:06:24.759 --> 1:06:26.661
So we can get a
tan before prom.

1:06:26.695 --> 1:06:27.762
Right, Iris?

1:06:31.766 --> 1:06:34.036
Did anybody ask you yet?

1:06:34.070 --> 1:06:37.706
We saw you with Jeff Owings
the other night dancing.

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:39.708
No

1:06:39.741 --> 1:06:41.911
Well, he hasn't
asked anybody else.

1:06:41.944 --> 1:06:44.679
Susan Laharty
is beside herself.

1:06:44.713 --> 1:06:47.116
She thought for sure they'd
get back together by prom.

1:06:47.149 --> 1:06:48.050
She can forget it.

1:06:48.084 --> 1:06:49.517
He doesn't even go to prom.

1:06:49.551 --> 1:06:50.852
He's one of them lone
wolf types, you know.

1:06:50.887 --> 1:06:54.623
That may be but
I'll have Clarissa

1:06:54.656 --> 1:06:55.892
put in a good word with him.

1:06:57.626 --> 1:06:58.760
Uh, thanks.

1:07:01.796 --> 1:07:02.899
I don't want that.

1:07:02.932 --> 1:07:05.767
What's in here, though?

1:07:16.645 --> 1:07:18.546
Iris, you wanna ride?

1:07:40.769 --> 1:07:41.636
Oh, come on.

1:07:41.670 --> 1:07:42.972
You can't tell me
you didn't love it.

1:07:43.005 --> 1:07:44.839
I didn't love it.

1:07:44.873 --> 1:07:45.540
They're gonna find out
your daddy doesn't work

1:07:45.573 --> 1:07:47.642
for Life Magazine any second.

1:07:47.676 --> 1:07:50.512
If that's all they find
out then I'm gonna be lucky.

1:07:50.545 --> 1:07:53.515
Besides, his magazine's
owned by Life.

1:07:53.548 --> 1:07:54.917
You can't keep
lying like that.

1:07:54.951 --> 1:07:57.119
I swear I will
never lie to you.

1:07:57.153 --> 1:08:02.058
But it was so worth it watching
their dumb faces squirm

1:08:02.091 --> 1:08:05.027
when I told them my dad
thought you were deep.

1:08:11.267 --> 1:08:12.201
Hey!

1:08:12.234 --> 1:08:13.835
What are you doing?

1:08:16.205 --> 1:08:17.605
You shouldn't be naked.

1:08:17.639 --> 1:08:19.909
What if someone
comes and sees you?

1:08:19.942 --> 1:08:21.210
I thought you said
this place was private.

1:08:21.243 --> 1:08:22.677
Who's gonna come?

1:08:33.555 --> 1:08:35.623
- You did it!
- I did!

1:08:42.864 --> 1:08:43.765
Tallulah,
don't forget

1:08:43.798 --> 1:08:44.799
to drink your juice, please.

1:08:47.569 --> 1:08:48.870
Well, I understand
a certain young lady

1:08:48.904 --> 1:08:50.638
got asked to the prom.

1:08:50.672 --> 1:08:51.673
Oooo.

1:08:51.706 --> 1:08:52.942
Did I hear that right?

1:08:52.975 --> 1:08:54.210
Candy Butler phoned
me this morning

1:08:54.243 --> 1:08:56.012
to tell me that her
son Craig asked you.

1:08:56.045 --> 1:08:57.279
Oh.

1:08:58.147 --> 1:08:59.048
Girls.

1:08:59.081 --> 1:09:00.316
Shh, shh, shh.

1:09:00.349 --> 1:09:02.151
Candy says Craig's
a football player.

1:09:02.184 --> 1:09:02.985
Isn't that nice?

1:09:03.019 --> 1:09:04.753
He plays football.

1:09:04.786 --> 1:09:05.620
Sure.

1:09:08.224 --> 1:09:10.092
Well, I thought it would
be a good idea if you skip

1:09:10.126 --> 1:09:12.827
school and went to look for
a dress with your mother.

1:09:12.861 --> 1:09:13.762
How about that?

1:09:13.795 --> 1:09:14.796
You know I really can't.

1:09:14.829 --> 1:09:16.631
I've got a test
in Classics today.

1:09:16.664 --> 1:09:18.867
Oh, I think it's a
pretty good idea to go

1:09:18.901 --> 1:09:20.069
look for a dress
with your mother.

1:09:20.102 --> 1:09:23.005
I think it's a nice thing
for a mother and a daughter

1:09:23.039 --> 1:09:23.838
to do together.

1:09:23.872 --> 1:09:24.907
Don't you think?

1:09:25.941 --> 1:09:26.741
Okay.

1:09:28.077 --> 1:09:28.911
Well, good.

1:09:29.945 --> 1:09:31.147
Good.

1:09:31.180 --> 1:09:33.149
Well, then I'll
just go get ready.

1:09:37.719 --> 1:09:39.989
I don't want you
to worry about money.

1:09:40.022 --> 1:09:41.623
I want you to get what you want.

1:09:42.958 --> 1:09:43.959
No expense spared.

1:09:43.993 --> 1:09:44.960
All right?

1:09:44.994 --> 1:09:45.961
Thanks, Dad.

1:10:48.857 --> 1:10:52.760
Hello?

1:10:52.794 --> 1:10:53.628
Um.

1:10:58.968 --> 1:11:02.004
I wasn't expecting anyone.

1:11:02.037 --> 1:11:04.006
Uh, what can I do for ya?

1:11:05.107 --> 1:11:06.942
Got a date to the prom.

1:11:06.976 --> 1:11:09.278
You and half the
rest of the town.

1:11:09.311 --> 1:11:11.046
I'm booked the next
two weeks solid.

1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:15.417
You know, cuts and perms
and latest hairstyles, so.

1:11:17.052 --> 1:11:17.953
Okay.

1:11:17.987 --> 1:11:20.322
Well um, thanks anyway.

1:11:22.925 --> 1:11:25.094
I mean, I can show
you how to style it

1:11:25.127 --> 1:11:25.928
if you want.

1:11:26.896 --> 1:11:27.695
Yeah.

1:11:28.964 --> 1:11:29.764
That'd be

1:11:29.797 --> 1:11:30.732
that'd be great.

1:11:30.765 --> 1:11:32.800
Um, I just got this dress today

1:11:32.834 --> 1:11:36.005
and my mom wanted me to see
what hairstyle would go with it.

1:11:36.038 --> 1:11:37.406
Well, let's see the dress.

1:11:42.478 --> 1:11:43.879
Was that your choice?

1:11:45.014 --> 1:11:46.415
What do you think?

1:11:46.448 --> 1:11:47.883
I think, no.

1:11:47.917 --> 1:11:48.750
Right.

1:11:50.052 --> 1:11:51.853
Well, you didn't
get to pick the dress

1:11:51.887 --> 1:11:54.323
so you're gonna have
to pick the hairstyle.

1:11:57.293 --> 1:11:58.860
Can I put it right there?

1:11:58.894 --> 1:11:59.727
Sure can.

1:12:09.338 --> 1:12:12.774
You seem to be adjusting
to Wakita pretty fast.

1:12:13.841 --> 1:12:14.742
Yeah, it's okay.

1:12:16.912 --> 1:12:17.913
Do you like it here?

1:12:20.115 --> 1:12:23.919
I wouldn't have chosen
it but my great-aunt

1:12:23.953 --> 1:12:26.155
left me the house
after she died.

1:12:26.188 --> 1:12:29.091
And I needed a fresh start,

1:12:29.124 --> 1:12:31.026
so here I am.

1:12:35.197 --> 1:12:37.832
Now um, you know,
we could give you a

1:12:39.168 --> 1:12:40.369
we could give you a chignon.

1:12:40.402 --> 1:12:42.071
Give you that
Roman Holiday look.

1:12:43.539 --> 1:12:46.108
That kind of
gives me a headache.

1:12:46.141 --> 1:12:48.010
Goes with the dress.

1:12:51.914 --> 1:12:55.217
I mean, we could do
Dorothy from Wizard of Oz.

1:12:55.251 --> 1:12:57.319
Or Annette Funicello.

1:12:58.921 --> 1:13:01.756
All I need is a bullet bra
and something to fill it with.

1:13:05.561 --> 1:13:07.129
I mean, I like you like this.

1:13:09.164 --> 1:13:10.765
Unadorned, you know?

1:13:12.101 --> 1:13:13.135
Just you.

1:13:14.970 --> 1:13:17.172
I don't think you
need a style, sweetie.

1:13:17.206 --> 1:13:21.310
But if you want I can fit you
in for a set and dry day of.

1:13:22.911 --> 1:13:23.545
Okay.

1:13:25.214 --> 1:13:26.582
What time is the dance?

1:13:26.615 --> 1:13:28.083
Uh, 6:00.

1:13:31.086 --> 1:13:33.289
How about two o'clock?

1:13:33.322 --> 1:13:34.223
That'd be great.

1:13:36.091 --> 1:13:37.426
Two o'clock it is.

1:13:41.063 --> 1:13:41.897
Do you miss him?

1:13:46.068 --> 1:13:46.969
Yes, I do.

1:13:49.038 --> 1:13:50.139
He was a good boy.

1:13:52.207 --> 1:13:54.410
Do you think
you'll ever marry again?

1:13:59.348 --> 1:14:01.116
I... I was never married.

1:14:03.952 --> 1:14:06.488
I just told people
that when I moved here.

1:14:06.522 --> 1:14:08.390
You know people in a small town,

1:14:09.625 --> 1:14:11.160
they don't wanna know.

1:14:12.127 --> 1:14:14.163
Well, they don't need
to know everything.

1:14:15.998 --> 1:14:18.200
So he was your lover?

1:14:18.233 --> 1:14:19.301
No, that would be scandalous.

1:14:19.335 --> 1:14:20.302
No.

1:14:20.336 --> 1:14:22.438
No, that's my brother, Eddie.

1:14:30.179 --> 1:14:32.247
He was 19 when he went to Korea.

1:14:34.183 --> 1:14:36.618
He was so skinny that
his uniform hung off him

1:14:36.652 --> 1:14:38.887
like a gunny sack
on a broomstick.

1:14:40.089 --> 1:14:41.457
He had pimples all
over his forehead.

1:14:44.393 --> 1:14:46.362
He thought he'd
never get a girl.

1:14:48.230 --> 1:14:49.932
He was so desperate
to get a girl.

1:14:51.166 --> 1:14:53.669
That's the sad part for me

1:14:53.702 --> 1:14:54.536
that um

1:14:55.938 --> 1:14:57.506
that he never outgrew that.

1:15:01.210 --> 1:15:03.612
That notion of being
a flawed person.

1:15:21.196 --> 1:15:23.198
So I'll um, I'll
see you on the 15th.

1:15:26.001 --> 1:15:26.635
Okay.

1:15:28.270 --> 1:15:29.071
Great.

1:15:30.239 --> 1:15:31.306
- All right.
- Bye, thank you.

1:15:48.724 --> 1:15:50.726
Hey!

1:15:50.759 --> 1:15:52.528
I don't recall saying yes.

1:15:56.165 --> 1:15:57.633
Better go
talk to her, Craig.

1:16:06.442 --> 1:16:08.210
Can I help you with somethin'?

1:16:08.243 --> 1:16:09.711
I don't think it's very
nice that you're telling

1:16:09.745 --> 1:16:12.080
everyone around town you're
taking a gal to a dance

1:16:12.114 --> 1:16:14.450
when she never did say yes.

1:16:14.483 --> 1:16:15.417
Don't you think I have the right

1:16:15.451 --> 1:16:17.052
to make up my own mind?

1:16:17.085 --> 1:16:19.354
I figured I knew
what was good for ya.

1:16:19.388 --> 1:16:21.356
You think so?

1:16:21.390 --> 1:16:22.291
Know so.

1:16:23.425 --> 1:16:24.259
Prove it.

1:16:31.133 --> 1:16:32.601
Oh man!

1:16:32.634 --> 1:16:34.269
You just going to
leave us like that?

1:16:37.272 --> 1:16:40.275
Craig!
She got a sister?

1:16:46.381 --> 1:16:47.349
What are we doing here?

1:16:47.382 --> 1:16:48.650
What, are you chicken?

1:16:49.852 --> 1:16:53.155
I do not need to see a ghost
come up out of that water.

1:16:53.188 --> 1:16:56.458
Oh, a big ol' strong man like
you ain't afraid of nothing!

1:16:59.561 --> 1:17:03.398
Damn, you
city girls is fast.

1:17:03.432 --> 1:17:06.201
And you
country boys is slow.

1:17:06.235 --> 1:17:10.272
We can be
if you want us to be.

1:17:10.305 --> 1:17:11.640
I like it fast,

1:17:12.841 --> 1:17:14.243
then slow.

1:17:15.177 --> 1:17:17.045
Damn.

1:17:17.079 --> 1:17:18.580
You
forget to be afraid.

1:17:20.315 --> 1:17:21.650
I'm afraid of you.

1:17:41.503 --> 1:17:42.704
What are you doing?

1:17:42.738 --> 1:17:44.540
Let me in before I
break my goddamn neck

1:17:44.573 --> 1:17:46.208
for Christ sake.

1:17:48.143 --> 1:17:51.213
Geez Louise, goodness gracious.

1:17:51.246 --> 1:17:53.815
Shh, shh, you have to be quiet

1:17:53.849 --> 1:17:56.084
'cause if my mom hears you
there will be hell to pay.

1:17:56.118 --> 1:17:58.453
Ugh, there's
always hell to pay.

1:17:58.487 --> 1:17:59.755
You're drunk.

1:18:00.689 --> 1:18:02.224
I am?

1:18:02.257 --> 1:18:03.225
You smell like...

1:18:04.426 --> 1:18:05.561
What is that?

1:18:05.594 --> 1:18:08.196
Um, lighter fluid?

1:18:08.230 --> 1:18:09.565
I think?

1:18:09.598 --> 1:18:10.766
Let me go get you some water.

1:18:10.799 --> 1:18:12.200
No, no, no, don't
get any water,

1:18:12.234 --> 1:18:14.303
I'll just get drunker,
I don't need any.

1:18:14.336 --> 1:18:15.203
Where you been?

1:18:17.439 --> 1:18:18.607
I've been to Hell.

1:18:21.310 --> 1:18:25.547
I saw the Devil and he
said, "Maggie Richmond,

1:18:26.615 --> 1:18:28.283
"you don't fool me."

1:18:29.451 --> 1:18:30.252
Shh, shh, shh.

1:18:30.285 --> 1:18:32.421
Fool me. Hey,
Iris it's just that

1:18:33.822 --> 1:18:37.359
it don't matter if
I change my hair,

1:18:39.194 --> 1:18:40.362
or have different clothes.

1:18:40.395 --> 1:18:43.265
I'm still me, I'm
still the same person.

1:18:43.298 --> 1:18:44.733
I always was.

1:18:44.766 --> 1:18:46.268
I don't know what you're
talking about, Maggie.

1:18:46.301 --> 1:18:47.803
It don't matter if my daddy

1:18:48.938 --> 1:18:52.407
moves me from the
city with all of those

1:18:52.441 --> 1:18:55.544
bad influences, and no matter

1:18:56.812 --> 1:18:58.847
I'm sick in the soul

1:18:58.881 --> 1:19:01.617
and I need savin'.

1:19:02.551 --> 1:19:03.785
Oh, Maggie.

1:19:03.819 --> 1:19:05.554
Don't matter if
I lose my virginity

1:19:05.587 --> 1:19:09.191
to Craig Butler in
the Sumner Pond.

1:19:09.224 --> 1:19:10.359
Maggie.

1:19:10.392 --> 1:19:13.495
Let him put
himself inside of me.

1:19:13.528 --> 1:19:15.163
Hey, hey, hey.

1:19:17.666 --> 1:19:18.467
It's okay.

1:19:19.501 --> 1:19:22.704
I'm, I'm dirty,

1:19:22.738 --> 1:19:24.573
and I can't get it out of me!

1:19:24.606 --> 1:19:27.576
You're not dirty, Maggie.

1:19:27.609 --> 1:19:29.678
Don't cry, it's all
going to be okay.

1:19:29.711 --> 1:19:32.347
You're the only
one that gets me.

1:19:33.582 --> 1:19:37.853
You're the only one that
understands me.

1:19:39.521 --> 1:19:41.223
I promise, you're okay.

1:19:41.256 --> 1:19:43.792
The only one that gets me.

1:19:43.825 --> 1:19:46.194
Hey, you're going to be.

1:19:51.500 --> 1:19:52.501
Maggie.

1:19:52.534 --> 1:19:53.635
I didn't mean
to do that to you.

1:19:53.669 --> 1:19:55.704
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

1:19:55.737 --> 1:19:58.306
I'm sorry, nothin' happened.

1:19:58.340 --> 1:19:59.408
It's okay.

1:19:59.441 --> 1:20:00.109
Nothin' happened. I don't
think of you that way.

1:20:00.143 --> 1:20:01.677
That's not how I think of you.

1:20:01.710 --> 1:20:03.345
I know you don't!

1:20:03.378 --> 1:20:05.213
It's never been like
that with you, I'm sorry.

1:20:05.247 --> 1:20:05.982
Maggie, no!

1:20:06.015 --> 1:20:06.815
Maggie, don't go!

1:20:06.848 --> 1:20:07.783
Maggie!

1:20:07.816 --> 1:20:09.886
Maggie, please don't go! Maggie!

1:20:53.662 --> 1:20:54.730
Hi.

1:20:54.763 --> 1:20:56.398
Hi.

1:20:56.431 --> 1:20:57.632
Is your dad around?

1:20:57.666 --> 1:20:59.634
I kinda need to talk
to him before school.

1:21:00.903 --> 1:21:03.638
He's in the barn,
tractor's down again.

1:21:04.806 --> 1:21:07.009
Well you're
a sight for sore eyes.

1:21:08.510 --> 1:21:09.711
Good morning,
Mrs. Deerborne.

1:21:09.745 --> 1:21:12.681
Oh, call me Francie, make
me feel like I'm 100 years old

1:21:12.714 --> 1:21:15.283
calling me Mrs. Deerborne.

1:21:15.317 --> 1:21:18.487
Iris, you best get on to
school before you're late.

1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:19.956
I'm waiting for my ride.

1:21:19.989 --> 1:21:21.958
It don't
look like she's coming.

1:21:23.625 --> 1:21:27.395
Maybe she's moved on
to greener pastures.

1:21:27.429 --> 1:21:28.630
Happens.

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:34.402
Actually
I'm her ride today,

1:21:34.436 --> 1:21:35.604
if she wants.

1:21:36.571 --> 1:21:39.474
It's okay, but she
don't need your pity.

1:21:39.508 --> 1:21:41.476
She doesn't need my pity,

1:21:41.510 --> 1:21:42.544
she just needs a ride.

1:22:34.964 --> 1:22:37.632
You need
a ride back home?

1:22:37.666 --> 1:22:38.733
Why?

1:22:40.569 --> 1:22:44.573
I saw you, during that
real hot stretch last August,

1:22:44.606 --> 1:22:45.540
at Sumner Pond.

1:22:49.544 --> 1:22:50.980
It was my mom's birthday.

1:22:53.415 --> 1:22:56.518
I just wanted to go someplace
where I maybe could you know,

1:22:56.551 --> 1:22:57.954
feel close to her.

1:22:58.955 --> 1:23:00.422
Talk to her maybe.

1:23:03.993 --> 1:23:05.560
Then I saw you there,

1:23:06.695 --> 1:23:08.663
you were sitting
there on the shore,

1:23:08.697 --> 1:23:10.832
looking up at the sky.

1:23:10.866 --> 1:23:13.535
You must've been thinking
about something real serious.

1:23:18.074 --> 1:23:19.075
I don't know,

1:23:20.977 --> 1:23:23.045
you looked so different alone.

1:23:24.546 --> 1:23:25.580
You seemed so...

1:23:27.682 --> 1:23:28.617
at peace.

1:23:29.986 --> 1:23:32.587
I thought, I don't know maybe,

1:23:34.924 --> 1:23:37.592
she could be at peace too.

1:23:52.942 --> 1:23:54.609
Iris!

1:23:54.643 --> 1:23:55.744
There you are.

1:23:55.777 --> 1:23:56.645
Hi, Hattie.

1:23:56.678 --> 1:23:57.746
Hi, Jeff.

1:23:57.779 --> 1:23:58.613
Guess what?

1:23:59.748 --> 1:24:01.050
I guess I'll see you.

1:24:01.083 --> 1:24:01.884
Guess what?

1:24:01.918 --> 1:24:02.817
What?

1:24:02.851 --> 1:24:04.653
Craig gave Maggie a ring!

1:24:04.686 --> 1:24:05.922
They're getting married?

1:24:05.955 --> 1:24:07.789
No silly, a promise ring!

1:24:08.723 --> 1:24:10.927
A promise to what?

1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:13.628
Oh Iris Deerborne, I
swear you're so deep,

1:24:13.662 --> 1:24:15.463
how come you don't know
what a promise ring is?

1:24:15.497 --> 1:24:16.232
Good heavens!

1:24:16.265 --> 1:24:17.832
Come on.

1:24:17.866 --> 1:24:19.068
He did what?

1:24:19.101 --> 1:24:21.703
Craig somehow
managed to bootleg

1:24:21.736 --> 1:24:22.905
a bottle of Dom.

1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:24.839
Dom?

1:24:24.873 --> 1:24:25.774
Perignon.

1:24:25.807 --> 1:24:27.709
It's champagne.

1:24:27.742 --> 1:24:28.743
Ta-da!

1:24:30.679 --> 1:24:31.981
It was his grandmothers.

1:24:33.815 --> 1:24:35.251
Looks new.

1:24:35.284 --> 1:24:36.718
Well I shined it up
with some toothpaste,

1:24:36.751 --> 1:24:38.154
but it's a bonafide antique.

1:24:44.293 --> 1:24:46.128
I like aged things.

1:25:20.762 --> 1:25:22.564
I swear this is the
last greasy burger

1:25:22.597 --> 1:25:24.566
I'm having for the
next two weeks,

1:25:24.599 --> 1:25:26.002
or I'm going to be
blemished for prom.

1:25:26.035 --> 1:25:28.304
Yeah, I think I'm
going to skip lunch.

1:25:28.337 --> 1:25:30.973
You have to skip it
up to fit in your dress.

1:25:32.141 --> 1:25:33.742
Why do you
gals always pick on me?

1:25:33.775 --> 1:25:35.177
Hattie!

1:25:35.211 --> 1:25:37.046
No honestly, I don't
know why I put up with it?

1:25:37.079 --> 1:25:38.680
I'll just go get
the food.

1:25:44.819 --> 1:25:46.755
Can you let me out?

1:26:03.838 --> 1:26:05.774
Somethings wrong, I know it.

1:26:05.807 --> 1:26:07.176
Just leave it.

1:26:07.209 --> 1:26:08.310
I can always tell
when you're lying.

1:26:08.344 --> 1:26:09.211
I'm not lying.

1:26:10.845 --> 1:26:12.148
I don't believe you.

1:26:12.181 --> 1:26:13.082
Last night...

1:26:13.115 --> 1:26:14.884
I was drunk last night.

1:26:14.917 --> 1:26:16.252
I barely remember anything.

1:26:17.619 --> 1:26:18.320
You swore you'd
never lie to me,

1:26:18.354 --> 1:26:20.588
and you're doing it right now.

1:26:20.622 --> 1:26:22.925
Meet me at the pond tonight.

1:26:22.958 --> 1:26:24.026
I can't.

1:26:24.060 --> 1:26:24.894
Yes you can. Meet me.

1:26:27.329 --> 1:26:28.730
I changed my mind.

1:26:30.399 --> 1:26:32.234
I don't need to get fries.

1:27:01.263 --> 1:27:02.630
Maggie, what are you doing?

1:27:02.664 --> 1:27:03.899
We're having a
party, that's what.

1:27:06.335 --> 1:27:09.804
Maggie, I don't see
why we have to come here.

1:27:09.838 --> 1:27:11.941
This place gives me the creeps.

1:27:11.974 --> 1:27:13.008
Well that's
because our parents

1:27:13.042 --> 1:27:15.111
won't come looking for us here.

1:27:15.144 --> 1:27:16.145
Absolutely not.

1:27:18.380 --> 1:27:19.848
What are you doing?

1:27:19.882 --> 1:27:22.151
Maggie, why are they here?
This is our own place!

1:27:22.184 --> 1:27:24.120
Don't be so stingy.

1:27:24.153 --> 1:27:26.721
Craig Butler, you better
keep your trousers on.

1:27:26.754 --> 1:27:27.389
What'd you think it's

1:27:27.423 --> 1:27:28.958
gonna jump out at you?

1:27:28.991 --> 1:27:30.192
Ahhhhhh!

1:27:30.226 --> 1:27:31.360
You better put that
away, Craig Butler!

1:27:31.393 --> 1:27:32.428
That's for my eyes only!

1:27:32.461 --> 1:27:34.662
Get them out of here.

1:27:41.870 --> 1:27:44.873
I am not disrobing if
that's what you think.

1:27:44.907 --> 1:27:46.841
We've all seen it about
a hundred times, Hattie,

1:27:46.876 --> 1:27:48.843
I don't know what
the problem is?

1:27:48.878 --> 1:27:50.279
Oh, fine.

1:27:50.312 --> 1:27:52.281
Maggie, make them go, please.

1:27:52.314 --> 1:27:53.883
Stop!

1:27:53.916 --> 1:27:55.750
Come on in, Maggie!

1:27:57.953 --> 1:27:59.687
Oh my God!

1:27:59.721 --> 1:28:00.788
Stop it!

1:28:00.822 --> 1:28:02.291
- What are you doing? Get out!
- Whoa, whoa, you crazy?

1:28:02.324 --> 1:28:03.125
Stop it!

1:28:03.159 --> 1:28:04.692
Get out!

1:28:04.726 --> 1:28:08.830
Get up, get up, get out!

1:28:09.932 --> 1:28:10.966
Don't!

1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:11.833
Stop it!

1:28:11.866 --> 1:28:13.169
Calm down.

1:28:13.202 --> 1:28:13.969
Get out!

1:28:15.204 --> 1:28:17.339
She's gone crazy!

1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:20.442
Get out of my pond!

1:28:20.476 --> 1:28:22.311
Iris! Iris, stop!

1:28:22.344 --> 1:28:23.745
Iris, calm down!

1:28:23.778 --> 1:28:24.380
Stop!

1:28:24.413 --> 1:28:25.447
What's wrong?

1:28:25.481 --> 1:28:27.883
You're not like them,
you're nothing like them!

1:28:27.917 --> 1:28:30.486
You lie to them, not
me, you lie them.

1:28:30.519 --> 1:28:31.719
What is
she talking about?

1:28:31.753 --> 1:28:33.155
Have you lied to me?

1:28:33.189 --> 1:28:34.890
I don't know
what she's saying.

1:28:34.924 --> 1:28:36.392
Maggie, Maggie,
please help me.

1:28:36.425 --> 1:28:38.194
Come on, what's wrong with
you? What is wrong with you?

1:28:38.227 --> 1:28:40.996
You're what's wrong with me!

1:28:41.030 --> 1:28:42.331
Maggie!

1:28:42.364 --> 1:28:45.067
You're what's wrong with me.

1:28:45.100 --> 1:28:46.734
Stinky drawers.

1:28:48.504 --> 1:28:49.972
You're lying.

1:28:50.005 --> 1:28:51.040
Don't.

1:28:52.774 --> 1:28:53.841
I know you.

1:28:56.011 --> 1:28:58.914
Maggie, come
on in, the water's nice.

1:28:58.948 --> 1:29:01.317
We didn't want
her anyway.

1:29:01.350 --> 1:29:03.785
She'd just
stink up the place!

1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:06.088
Don't worry about her.

1:29:13.996 --> 1:29:16.232
Mags, where are you going?

1:29:45.127 --> 1:29:47.129
You shouldn't be here.

1:30:14.056 --> 1:30:17.426
I just don't get why Clarissa
gets to decide everything.

1:30:17.459 --> 1:30:19.461
I thought you
liked Cattleman's?

1:30:20.462 --> 1:30:21.330
That's not the point.

1:30:22.864 --> 1:30:24.533
She just, she decided
where we're eating

1:30:24.566 --> 1:30:26.801
prom night with out
asking me or my date.

1:30:28.504 --> 1:30:32.041
I just don't think I'm going
to put up with it anymore.

1:30:32.074 --> 1:30:33.976
What are you going
to do about it?

1:30:34.009 --> 1:30:35.511
Tell her off?

1:30:35.544 --> 1:30:37.446
I might!

1:30:37.479 --> 1:30:39.081
I'd like to see that.

1:30:39.114 --> 1:30:40.349
What, you think I wouldn't?

1:30:42.084 --> 1:30:43.152
No!

1:30:43.185 --> 1:30:44.486
I don't know.

1:30:44.520 --> 1:30:48.624
Its just, I'd like
to see it that's all.

1:30:53.662 --> 1:30:55.197
Where are we going?

1:30:55.230 --> 1:30:57.366
I'm supposed to pick
up some henna for my mom.

1:30:57.399 --> 1:30:59.268
It's after midnight.

1:31:00.536 --> 1:31:03.105
Hazel said she'd leave
it on the front porch.

1:31:04.106 --> 1:31:05.107
It's alright.

1:31:07.242 --> 1:31:08.544
I'll be right back.

1:31:12.348 --> 1:31:16.085
She done slam that
door, mmm that girl.

1:31:24.927 --> 1:31:27.329
What the Sam Hill are you doing!

1:31:27.363 --> 1:31:28.464
It's late!

1:31:28.497 --> 1:31:29.898
You'll wake her up!

1:31:29.932 --> 1:31:32.067
Maybe she left it
on the back stoop?

1:31:32.101 --> 1:31:35.504
Can we not do this in
the morning, I'm zonked!

1:31:35.537 --> 1:31:38.340
Keep your shirt on,
I'll just be a minute!

1:31:38.374 --> 1:31:40.509
Hattie!

1:32:29.691 --> 1:32:34.530
Maggie and
Hazel. Maggie and Hazel!

1:32:34.563 --> 1:32:36.231
Maggie and Hazel!

1:32:36.265 --> 1:32:38.267
Hattie, I can't make hide
or hair what you're saying.

1:32:38.300 --> 1:32:39.701
Maggie and Hazel.

1:32:39.735 --> 1:32:40.736
What, baby?

1:32:40.769 --> 1:32:43.038
I saw them together.

1:32:43.071 --> 1:32:44.506
What? Together?

1:32:44.540 --> 1:32:46.508
I saw them together.

1:32:48.076 --> 1:32:49.678
Baby baby, shh!

1:32:51.547 --> 1:32:53.749
It's alright baby.

1:32:53.782 --> 1:32:55.150
It's alright, it's alright.

1:32:55.184 --> 1:32:56.652
Shh! Mommy's here.

1:34:42.758 --> 1:34:44.159
I guess men like me

1:34:44.192 --> 1:34:46.161
ain't good enough for
you, are we, bitch?

1:34:55.871 --> 1:34:57.506
You brought all this
on yourself, honey!

1:34:59.374 --> 1:35:00.542
You know that?

1:35:07.416 --> 1:35:10.819
Now you can go back
to your sorry life!

1:35:49.324 --> 1:35:50.927
We can go
back to that doctor

1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:53.729
in Kansas city.

1:35:53.762 --> 1:35:54.897
He said he could help them

1:35:54.931 --> 1:35:59.167
they help so many kids like
that, help them be normal.

1:36:25.227 --> 1:36:26.495
Sorry

1:36:30.699 --> 1:36:31.733
You were

1:36:33.970 --> 1:36:37.272
You were my beautiful
little baby,

1:36:39.008 --> 1:36:40.208
my little girl.

1:36:41.576 --> 1:36:47.282
And you always woke
up smiling to see us

1:36:47.315 --> 1:36:47.950
and so happy.

1:36:49.518 --> 1:36:50.352
I'm sorry.

1:36:52.354 --> 1:36:53.990
We did
something wrong.

1:36:54.023 --> 1:36:56.792
I did something wrong.

1:37:07.036 --> 1:37:12.240
You were an angel.

1:37:13.775 --> 1:37:16.244
I'm gonna make it better.

1:37:18.346 --> 1:37:19.781
I'm gonna fix this.

1:37:19.815 --> 1:37:20.917
Jesus. Jesus.

1:37:20.950 --> 1:37:22.317
I promise.

1:37:24.352 --> 1:37:26.521
You don't have to
worry about me anymore.

1:37:28.057 --> 1:37:28.891
I'm sorry.

1:37:31.293 --> 1:37:32.861
I'm so sorry.

1:37:39.568 --> 1:37:40.869
Maggie!

1:37:43.973 --> 1:37:45.640
Maggie!

1:37:45.674 --> 1:37:47.342
Maggie!

1:38:16.072 --> 1:38:20.275
Mrs. Deerborne, it
was just so terrible.

1:38:22.011 --> 1:38:23.745
Oh, I knew it.

1:38:23.779 --> 1:38:25.614
I knew there was something
not right with that girl,

1:38:25.647 --> 1:38:26.448
I knew it.

1:38:26.481 --> 1:38:27.315
What's happened, mama?

1:38:28.583 --> 1:38:31.954
You. I don't even
wanna talk to you.

1:38:31.988 --> 1:38:34.023
What are you talking about?

1:38:34.056 --> 1:38:36.725
Hattie found that Maggie
Richmond and Hazel together.

1:38:37.994 --> 1:38:39.929
Hazel
cuts Maggie's hair.

1:38:39.962 --> 1:38:43.065
Not like that, you
dimwit, together.

1:38:43.099 --> 1:38:45.400
My poor baby is
traumatized for life.

1:38:45.433 --> 1:38:46.936
It's all over town.

1:38:46.969 --> 1:38:49.272
Boys done went over to
Hazel's and run her off.

1:38:51.439 --> 1:38:52.041
Where's Maggie?

1:38:52.074 --> 1:38:53.475
Ow!

1:38:53.508 --> 1:38:53.943
Don't you
touch my daughter.

1:38:53.976 --> 1:38:55.644
Where is she?

1:38:55.677 --> 1:38:58.080
Some of the kids saw her
go into to Sumner Pond.

1:38:58.114 --> 1:38:59.916
She just walked right in 'til
the water covered her head,

1:38:59.949 --> 1:39:01.516
just like Charlotte Owings.

1:39:03.953 --> 1:39:04.786
Iris!

1:39:08.623 --> 1:39:09.691
It's okay.

1:39:59.942 --> 1:40:01.676
You're Iris?

1:40:01.710 --> 1:40:02.544
Yes.

1:40:04.046 --> 1:40:06.681
Her mother told
me you were her friend.

1:40:06.715 --> 1:40:07.616
I am her friend.

1:40:08.550 --> 1:40:09.551
Have you seen her?

1:40:11.153 --> 1:40:12.989
Not since
yesterday, no.

1:40:15.523 --> 1:40:17.994
I've been looking
all over town.

1:40:18.027 --> 1:40:19.896
If you see her, tell
her to come home.

1:40:21.130 --> 1:40:23.698
Tell her it doesn't matter,
tell her I don't care anymore.

1:40:23.732 --> 1:40:25.500
We don't care if she was bad.

1:40:25.533 --> 1:40:29.171
Mr. Richmond,
she was never bad.

1:40:34.076 --> 1:40:35.912
We got something!

1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:40.216
Oh, let her disappear.

1:40:40.249 --> 1:40:42.184
Let her disappear,
let her disappear.

1:40:45.787 --> 1:40:48.224
What is it?

1:40:48.257 --> 1:40:50.192
I don't know!

1:40:51.559 --> 1:40:53.728
Neale, you got
your eyes on this?

1:41:08.210 --> 1:41:09.611
Is that?

1:41:11.513 --> 1:41:12.248
That looks like my...

1:41:12.281 --> 1:41:13.748
It's a dress!

1:41:19.188 --> 1:41:21.924
Do you know how much time and
labor I put into that dress?

1:41:21.958 --> 1:41:23.225
I do not think this is funny.

1:41:24.793 --> 1:41:25.995
I know mama.

1:41:26.028 --> 1:41:27.096
I never did have
a sense of humor.

1:41:27.129 --> 1:41:28.197
None whatsoever.

1:42:56.318 --> 1:42:57.752
Hey, come on now!

1:42:57.786 --> 1:42:59.221
Hey!

1:42:59.255 --> 1:43:00.289
Stinky drawers!

1:43:00.322 --> 1:43:01.924
Never knew you liked girls!

1:43:01.957 --> 1:43:04.093
Come on
Iris, where you going?

1:43:04.126 --> 1:43:05.261
Come on back.

1:43:05.294 --> 1:43:06.195
Hey, what are you doing?

1:43:06.228 --> 1:43:06.996
Stop it, stop it!

1:43:07.029 --> 1:43:07.930
You hit this truck.

1:43:07.963 --> 1:43:08.663
I swear, stop that!

1:43:08.696 --> 1:43:09.597
Shit!

1:43:09.631 --> 1:43:10.799
Alright come on!

1:43:10.832 --> 1:43:12.867
Get the hell
outta here, man!

1:43:12.902 --> 1:43:15.104
Don't you ever touch me again!

1:43:15.137 --> 1:43:16.305
You bastards!

1:43:16.338 --> 1:43:18.240
I'll kill you!

1:43:18.274 --> 1:43:19.341
I'll kill you!

1:43:19.375 --> 1:43:20.675
Crazy dyke!

1:43:21.676 --> 1:43:22.744
Cow fuckers!

1:43:34.423 --> 1:43:35.324
Okay I'm gonna

1:43:35.357 --> 1:43:38.394
have to watch your
sticky little fingers.

1:43:38.427 --> 1:43:41.197
Did I tell you Hattie said,

1:43:41.230 --> 1:43:42.131
when she saw them?

1:43:43.399 --> 1:43:44.599
Totally naked.

1:43:46.835 --> 1:43:47.669
Totally?

1:43:48.870 --> 1:43:50.272
Nothing, nothing on.

1:43:53.943 --> 1:43:56.912
Yep, and they still haven't
found that girl's body.

1:43:56.946 --> 1:43:59.115
I bet you she's down
there with Charlotte,

1:43:59.148 --> 1:44:01.716
trapped in one of them
underground caves forever.

1:44:02.885 --> 1:44:04.652
I don't think a girl
who can throw rocks

1:44:04.686 --> 1:44:08.924
like Maggie Richmond's gonna
let herself die of shame.

1:44:10.226 --> 1:44:12.660
I bet you she got on the
night bus out of Wakita

1:44:12.694 --> 1:44:14.662
and she snubbed her
nose at all the petty,

1:44:14.696 --> 1:44:17.632
small-minded people who
couldn't see her shine.

1:44:18.968 --> 1:44:20.936
Where you going
dressed like that?

1:44:20.970 --> 1:44:23.606
Maybe she's going
to the prom after all.

1:44:24.839 --> 1:44:27.076
I wouldn't go to that
prom to save my life.

1:44:28.310 --> 1:44:29.378
I've got a date.

1:44:31.013 --> 1:44:31.779
With who?

1:44:32.982 --> 1:44:34.016
A boy.

1:44:38.053 --> 1:44:39.421
Since when do you have a boy?

1:44:42.224 --> 1:44:45.027
I'm never gonna be as
beautiful as you are, mama,

1:44:46.462 --> 1:44:48.730
but I've got a date
with a boy tonight.

1:44:56.738 --> 1:44:58.274
I do love you, mama.

1:45:26.335 --> 1:45:29.338
Well, quit staring at me
and play your goddamn cards.

1:45:40.983 --> 1:45:42.017
You're late.

1:45:43.485 --> 1:45:48.490
Sorry, I had to pick
something up for you.

1:45:57.399 --> 1:46:00.369
Oh, it's beautiful.

1:46:00.402 --> 1:46:01.470
Here.

1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:12.780
Is this alright?

1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:19.521
Yes.
