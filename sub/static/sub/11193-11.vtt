WEBVTT

00:05.400 --> 00:08.935
<i>Let's go, Captain!
Those gliders are comin' back!</i>

00:08.919 --> 00:10.958
- This man's alive!
- We cannot wait!

00:15.596 --> 00:18.170
<i>Not all Goa'uld are the same.</i>

00:18.196 --> 00:19.772
I am Jolinar of Malk-shur.

00:20.875 --> 00:22.951
Jolinar is wanted in Goa'uld town.

00:22.993 --> 00:25.532
<i>He claims to be part of the Tok'ra.</i>

00:25.553 --> 00:29.338
The Tok'ra is an alliance of Goa'uld
who oppose the System Lords.

00:29.312 --> 00:31.803
<i>I will never, never trust a Goa'uld!</i>

00:32.670 --> 00:34.082
<i>Kree shac.</i>

00:34.151 --> 00:38.529
By decree of the Goa'uld System Lords,
you will die with dishonour.

00:38.469 --> 00:41.423
My death feeds the fire
that burns strong in the Tok'ra.

00:44.508 --> 00:46.049
Sam! Sam!

00:46.786 --> 00:48.826
The Goa'uld gave its life for me.

00:49.386 --> 00:51.426
It saved me.

00:54.265 --> 00:56.552
- Jacob Carter.
- Carter?

00:56.585 --> 00:58.161
As in... my father, sir, yes.

00:58.223 --> 01:01.259
George said you were up
for the Air Medal for your work in...

01:01.262 --> 01:03.386
What the hell was that again?

01:03.421 --> 01:06.588
- Deep space radar telemetry.
- Right!

01:06.581 --> 01:09.036
- I have cancer, Sam.
- What?

01:09.060 --> 01:11.099
- Lymphoma.
- Oh, God... Dad!

01:11.140 --> 01:15.885
This is gonna go on for months, so you
don't have to check up on me tomorrow.

01:15.819 --> 01:18.487
Dad, please don't go like this.

01:18.496 --> 01:19.445
Dad!

01:35.852 --> 01:39.304
We have to activate the Chaapa-ai.
Quickly, Jolinar!

01:55.725 --> 01:57.349
Argh!

02:08.602 --> 02:10.639
Jolinar, hurry!

02:19.397 --> 02:21.770
I think I might have found something.

03:30.576 --> 03:32.783
You don't think it was just a dream?

03:35.614 --> 03:38.698
No, sir. It was real. I could tell.

03:38.694 --> 03:41.066
- You could tell?
- Yes, sir.

03:41.093 --> 03:43.963
I don't know how exactly, but I could tell.

03:43.972 --> 03:49.311
So we're supposed to buy into this... ESP,
or whatever it is?

03:49.210 --> 03:52.413
O'Neill, when a Goa'uld infests its host,...

03:52.408 --> 03:55.195
...their minds intermingle, become as one.

03:55.207 --> 03:59.538
Portions of Jolinar of Malk-shur
may remain in Captain Carter's mind.

03:59.487 --> 04:01.776
<i>These Tok'ra were on the run.</i>

04:01.806 --> 04:03.633
They may be in trouble.

04:03.686 --> 04:05.974
We should find them before they move on.

04:06.006 --> 04:08.294
They may still be at these coordinates.

04:08.324 --> 04:10.862
You said their eyes glowed.

04:10.884 --> 04:14.834
Are you sure that these Tok'ra
are what Jolinar said they were?

04:14.801 --> 04:17.589
- Good guys, for lack of a better word.
- Yes.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.225
Yes? Just... yes?

04:20.240 --> 04:21.817
Could you elaborate a little?

04:21.879 --> 04:25.129
I'm sorry, Colonel.
I know it's hard to understand.

04:25.119 --> 04:29.033
I don't really understand it myself,
but I am sure.

04:28.997 --> 04:30.824
I... I just know.

04:30.877 --> 04:34.875
According to Jaffa legend,
the Tok'ra are the Goa'uld resistance.

04:34.836 --> 04:39.415
Their goal is to destroy the System Lords
and change the ways of the empire.

04:39.355 --> 04:41.514
They are despised by the Goa'uld.

04:41.552 --> 04:43.841
Yes! My kind of guys.

04:43.872 --> 04:45.533
General Hammond, if I may.

04:45.593 --> 04:50.932
My vision is our only lead. Shouldn't we
at least check it out before they move on?

04:51.191 --> 04:52.601
Colonel?

04:54.269 --> 04:55.894
General?

04:55.949 --> 05:00.161
I'm prepared to send SG-1 to the
coordinates in Captain Carter's vision.

05:00.108 --> 05:02.516
<i>- If you agree.
- Colonel...</i>

05:02.547 --> 05:06.759
I know you're scepticaI, but I am
confident that I'm right on this one.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.569
Let's check it out.

05:24.901 --> 05:27.687
Colonel, is it all right
if I catch up with you?

05:27.699 --> 05:30.154
- We leave in ten.
- Only need five.

05:43.975 --> 05:46.014
Dad. Hi, it's me - Sam.

05:49.052 --> 05:51.509
What do you mean,
why am I calling, Dad?

05:51.531 --> 05:54.449
You just told me
you have cancer. You can't...

05:55.971 --> 05:58.009
Right. OK, never mind.

05:58.050 --> 06:01.004
Listen, uh... I'm about to go on a little trip.

06:01.968 --> 06:04.009
Yes, it's for the Air Force.

06:05.127 --> 06:07.619
It's not important where I'm going, Dad.

06:07.648 --> 06:11.858
But I may be gone a while, and I just
wanted to call and see how you're doin'.

06:17.963 --> 06:19.588
You're sure?

06:35.038 --> 06:37.077
Your father?

06:39.516 --> 06:41.557
Yes, sir.

06:41.596 --> 06:44.716
- How is Jake?
- He claims he's OK.

06:44.715 --> 06:47.466
Not that he'd tell me if he weren't.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.048
Did you know he got an apartment
here in town?

06:50.074 --> 06:52.944
He wanted to be closer
to his daughter during...

06:53.793 --> 06:55.832
During his last days.

06:58.271 --> 07:01.723
Sir, this is the first time
I've left on a mission where...

07:01.709 --> 07:04.627
...I've felt like I might be
leaving something behind.

07:04.629 --> 07:07.000
Like I might miss something important.

07:07.028 --> 07:08.855
Understandable.

07:08.908 --> 07:12.442
I'll put a temporary replacement on SG-1.
You can stay here.

07:12.427 --> 07:14.086
I wish I could, sir.

07:14.146 --> 07:17.064
But I don't think
I'm replaceable on this one.

07:17.064 --> 07:20.564
The memories Jolinar left in my mind
could be invaluable.

07:20.545 --> 07:22.372
No one else has them.

07:22.423 --> 07:24.713
True. But... your father...

07:24.742 --> 07:27.661
Sir, it's OK.
He doesn't want me around anyway.

07:27.661 --> 07:30.947
Sam, I've known Jacob a long time.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.100
That's not true.

07:34.659 --> 07:38.740
Sir, he's always too concerned about
appearing the strong soldier.

07:38.699 --> 07:44.120
The last thing he would want is for me to
see him in a hospital bed losing a battle.

07:46.776 --> 07:50.644
I should get going, sir.
I don't want to hold things up.

07:50.615 --> 07:52.192
Captain!

07:55.334 --> 07:59.165
You're more like your father
than you'd like to admit.

08:25.285 --> 08:27.990
There is no evidence
of footprints or tracks.

08:28.004 --> 08:32.250
If the Tok'ra were here, they have not
been near the gate in many days.

08:34.922 --> 08:37.837
Where's that yellow brick road
when you need it, Dorothy?

08:39.639 --> 08:42.096
Some sort of dunes over there.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.477
Dunes it is.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.143
Worthless.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.113
No one's tread here in a while.

09:02.153 --> 09:06.102
<i>The Tok'ra are known
for their ability to mask their trails.</i>

09:06.072 --> 09:08.692
They are, as you say,
stealthy in their actions.

09:13.870 --> 09:16.787
Yeah, stealthy would be
a good word, Teal'c.

09:17.989 --> 09:20.028
Good guys or bad guys?

09:22.667 --> 09:25.370
We mean you no harm, but I warn you.

09:25.385 --> 09:28.386
If you make any aggressive moves,
we will fire upon you.

09:28.384 --> 09:29.927
Same here.

09:31.144 --> 09:34.227
But we will have the advantage.
There are more of us.

09:37.142 --> 09:38.932
This is true.

09:38.981 --> 09:42.018
This one is a Jaffa. Apophis sect.

09:42.019 --> 09:46.432
- I am no longer in the service of Apophis.
- Who, then, are you in service to?

09:46.379 --> 09:48.586
I am allied with these, the Tauri,...

09:48.618 --> 09:52.745
<i>- .. in battle against Apophis.
- And all other Goa'uld.</i>

09:52.697 --> 09:54.903
- Be careful, Daniel.
- Why?

09:54.936 --> 09:58.351
- Because they are Goa'uld.
- Do not call us that.

09:58.335 --> 10:00.375
<i>We are not Goa'uld!</i>

10:11.130 --> 10:12.755
Hammond.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.450
Put him through.

10:17.210 --> 10:19.249
Jacob? Are you OK?

10:21.168 --> 10:23.207
Oh, no. I'll be right there.

10:34.803 --> 10:38.422
You know, in some galaxies,
this is called "loitering".

10:38.403 --> 10:40.644
How long do you think we can keep it up?

10:44.040 --> 10:45.665
Martouf.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.951
I do not know this woman.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.538
But I'm right, aren't I?
Your name is Martouf.

10:54.118 --> 10:55.826
It is.

10:55.878 --> 10:57.917
- How do you know me?
- I don't.

10:57.956 --> 11:01.705
But I knew someone who did.
His name was Jolinar of Malk-shur.

11:04.995 --> 11:07.034
Where is Jolinar?

11:08.354 --> 11:10.346
He died saving my life.

11:10.393 --> 11:13.596
That's why we're here.
To seek out the Tok'ra.

11:13.591 --> 11:16.841
<i>Assuming, of course, you are the Tok'ra.</i>

11:18.270 --> 11:20.062
And if we're not?

11:20.110 --> 11:22.815
Well, I guess we all start shooting.

11:22.828 --> 11:26.494
There's blood, death, hard feelings.
It'd suck.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.855
And if we are this thing you call Tok'ra?

11:30.866 --> 11:34.865
If you are the Tok'ra of Jaffa legend,
we should form an alliance.

11:34.826 --> 11:39.701
I learned a lot from Jolinar. Enough
to know that we could be good friends.

11:39.624 --> 11:42.293
And enough to know
that you are the Tok'ra.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.308
I believe this one speaks the truth.

11:54.499 --> 11:56.538
Perhaps we should...

11:56.577 --> 11:59.413
...just listen to what they have to say.

12:17.572 --> 12:19.611
Well, that's better, isn't it?

12:21.291 --> 12:22.750
So,...

12:22.809 --> 12:24.850
...take me to your leader.

12:24.889 --> 12:26.928
I will take you to whom you seek.

12:26.970 --> 12:30.469
But on one condition.
You must leave your weapons with us.

12:31.408 --> 12:33.317
Ah, no. No.

12:33.368 --> 12:37.033
- They won't hurt us, Colonel.
- They're Goa'ulds, Carter.

12:37.005 --> 12:40.588
- They won't hurt us.
- And you, what... feel this?

12:40.566 --> 12:42.807
No. I can remember it.

12:44.443 --> 12:47.114
O'Neill, if they are the Tok'ra,...

12:47.123 --> 12:50.124
...we are in no danger.

12:50.121 --> 12:52.364
I vote we take the chance.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.046
OK. But I want it understood...

12:59.080 --> 13:02.697
...that we're doing this
in the spirit of future relations.

13:02.677 --> 13:04.801
I expect us to be treated as such.

13:31.548 --> 13:34.384
Please, come closer together.

13:34.388 --> 13:36.879
- Why?
- Jack...

13:36.908 --> 13:39.576
- It's OK, Colonel.
- Oh, it is?

13:54.461 --> 13:56.500
This way.

13:58.461 --> 14:00.833
This looks just like the place in my dream.

14:00.860 --> 14:05.687
But that was on the planet
that we - they - were fleeing.

14:05.618 --> 14:11.158
Legend says that when the Tok'ra arrive
on a planet, they go deep underground.

14:11.057 --> 14:14.177
That they possess
the technology to grow tunnels.

14:14.176 --> 14:18.221
This is some crystal material.
Theoretically it could be grown.

14:18.174 --> 14:24.047
<i>Apophis had me search for such
tunnels for years. We never found them.</i>

14:23.932 --> 14:27.217
When the Tok'ra move on,
the tunnels are destroyed.

14:28.331 --> 14:29.956
Carter.

14:30.009 --> 14:33.296
- What's the story with this Martouf?
- I'm not sure.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.374
I get the feeling I know
almost all of these people,...

14:36.369 --> 14:39.287
...but my memories of Martouf
are the strongest.

14:39.288 --> 14:41.743
It's like I have some weird bond with him.

14:43.927 --> 14:45.966
Please, come this way.

15:20.556 --> 15:21.966
George!

15:22.953 --> 15:24.365
Jacob.

15:24.434 --> 15:26.474
Are you all right?

15:27.993 --> 15:30.032
I've been better.

15:30.072 --> 15:34.283
I was under the impression that
the cancer hadn't gone this far.

15:34.230 --> 15:36.307
So was I.

15:36.350 --> 15:38.592
They cleaned out all the Iymph nodes.

15:38.629 --> 15:42.413
The problem is, apparently,
one squadron of those little buggers...

15:42.388 --> 15:44.629
...got themselves reassigned in my liver.

15:44.668 --> 15:47.503
Let me make a call.
Get Captain Carter recalled.

15:47.506 --> 15:49.334
There's no need.

15:51.345 --> 15:54.181
- Jacob, she should be here.
- Why?

15:54.184 --> 15:57.139
Let me tell you something, George.

15:57.144 --> 15:59.717
My little girl grew up
seeing Daddy go off...

15:59.743 --> 16:02.317
...to God knows where
to fight God knows who.

16:02.342 --> 16:04.631
And I always came home alive and well.

16:04.660 --> 16:08.445
Now I'm gonna let her sit here
and watch me lose a war?

16:08.419 --> 16:11.374
To some little runt so small
I can't even see him?

16:13.259 --> 16:16.009
That's exactly
what she thought you'd say.

16:17.897 --> 16:21.230
How about doing us all a favour, Jake?

16:21.216 --> 16:23.043
What?

16:23.096 --> 16:25.254
Cut the brave soldier routine.

16:25.296 --> 16:30.289
She's your daughter. She should have a
chance to be here to see you through this.

16:30.213 --> 16:35.634
I've got a feeling she's on a pretty
important mission right now. Am I right?

16:36.730 --> 16:38.937
Well, yes, but there are others...

16:38.971 --> 16:43.134
Then do me a favour
and honour my wishes. Leave her there.

16:44.168 --> 16:46.209
This is ridiculous.

16:46.249 --> 16:49.664
- There is one thing you could do for me.
- Anything.

16:49.647 --> 16:52.054
Tell me what my little girl's doing.

16:52.087 --> 16:56.465
Except that. You know it's classified.

16:56.404 --> 16:59.940
George, they're tellin' me
I don't have much time left.

17:00.964 --> 17:03.003
Who am I gonna tell?

17:03.043 --> 17:04.703
God?

17:08.123 --> 17:10.162
<i>I'm sorry, Jake.</i>

17:26.476 --> 17:28.515
People of the Tauri,...

17:28.556 --> 17:32.055
...let me introduce
Grand Council Garshaw of Belote.

17:36.832 --> 17:38.872
<i>Greetings.</i>

17:38.912 --> 17:40.371
Hi!

17:40.432 --> 17:42.508
You are Garshaw of Belote?

17:42.550 --> 17:44.460
I am.

17:48.348 --> 17:51.019
She is the most hunted Goa'uld
of all time.

17:51.788 --> 17:54.539
We prefer you to
not refer to us as Goa'uld.

17:54.548 --> 17:56.587
Yeah, we... got that earlier.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.583
<i>What should we call you?</i>

17:59.625 --> 18:01.950
I assume you are from the first world.

18:01.984 --> 18:04.476
The Tauri. Is that correct?

18:04.503 --> 18:06.544
Yeah.

18:06.584 --> 18:10.830
Were you among those who rid the galaxy
of the Supreme System Lord,...

18:10.742 --> 18:12.285
...Ra?

18:12.340 --> 18:14.381
Yup. That's us.

18:14.421 --> 18:16.248
That... Yeah, we're those.

18:16.299 --> 18:20.678
<i>- Then, in a sense, you are Tok'ra.
- Of course!</i>

18:20.619 --> 18:22.660
Tok'ra! Tok...

18:22.698 --> 18:26.280
Tok Ra - against Ra.
Thank you for... sharing that.

18:26.258 --> 18:28.630
We still don't know what to call her.

18:28.655 --> 18:31.407
We, too, are Tok'ra.

18:31.415 --> 18:32.958
Finally!

18:33.016 --> 18:34.807
It's a pleasure to meet you.

18:34.855 --> 18:38.900
I understand you were sent to us
by Jolinar of Malk-shur.

18:38.853 --> 18:41.521
Please, tell us how that came to be.

18:41.531 --> 18:44.319
Well, it... uh... It's a long story.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.413
We were on this planet - Nasya.

18:47.451 --> 18:50.570
The Goa'uld were attacking.
Jolinar's host was killed.

18:50.569 --> 18:55.528
So he... jumped into me
while I was trying to save his host.

18:55.448 --> 18:57.523
Please, excuse me.

18:57.567 --> 19:01.150
- Did you say Jolinar's host was killed?
- Yes.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.076
I'm sorry.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.403
But Jolinar... lived on?

19:08.084 --> 19:11.038
Uh, yeah. For a while, at least.
Inside of me.

19:11.643 --> 19:13.719
Should I continue?

19:13.761 --> 19:15.137
Please.

19:16.481 --> 19:20.016
He's in V-tach.
We'll shock him at uh... 200. OK, clear!

19:25.400 --> 19:27.688
Again at 300. Clear!

19:32.238 --> 19:34.277
Normal sinus. OK.

19:37.075 --> 19:39.744
Hey, General, how are you doing?

19:39.755 --> 19:42.044
All right. He's in aplastic crisis.

19:42.074 --> 19:46.701
Let's give him a unit of packed cells.
Check his vitals every 15 minutes.

19:46.633 --> 19:49.087
Let me know if anything changes.

19:49.112 --> 19:50.060
Doctor...

19:51.311 --> 19:53.351
He's... uh... stable, for now.

19:53.391 --> 19:57.009
May I ask... how long does he have?

19:56.989 --> 20:01.615
Can't say with a cancer like this.
Could be five days or five minutes.

20:03.547 --> 20:05.172
Sorry.

20:05.227 --> 20:08.596
If there's any family to contact,
I'd get them here ASAP

20:19.821 --> 20:24.281
So am I to understand you did not
invite Jolinar to use you as a host?

20:24.221 --> 20:28.469
That is correct. He did it in an emergency,
to escape an assassin.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.911
Then if you are not a voluntary host,...

20:30.939 --> 20:35.434
...how do we know that you
did not kill Jolinar yourself?

20:36.176 --> 20:38.215
Uh... Well, because I didn't.

20:38.256 --> 20:41.008
I guess you'll just have to trust us on that.

20:41.016 --> 20:42.723
And why should we trust you?

20:42.773 --> 20:47.152
You know somethin'? I've been
asking myself the same damn question.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.788
<i>Why should we trust you?</i>

20:50.813 --> 20:53.268
You are, after all, Goa'ulds.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.330
- Jack...
- Ah - don't!

20:55.372 --> 20:58.241
We've done nothing but
get interrogated here.

20:58.250 --> 21:02.330
Now, are we prisoners,
and are you Goa'ulds?

21:02.288 --> 21:05.824
You are not.
And I have told you, we are not Goa'uld!

21:05.807 --> 21:07.266
I didn't...

21:07.326 --> 21:09.366
Why do you talk like that?

21:09.405 --> 21:11.565
And what's with the glowing eyes, huh?

21:11.605 --> 21:15.817
Might it have something to do with
a little reptilian activity in your heads?

21:15.765 --> 21:19.015
We have symbiotic creatures
within us, yes.

21:19.002 --> 21:20.795
Well, then?

21:20.844 --> 21:25.257
Well, then, you can see how we might
think you would be a danger to humans.

21:25.201 --> 21:29.946
- You take humans as hosts.
- Goa'uld take hosts. Tok'ra do not.

21:29.881 --> 21:31.920
Ours wish to be so.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.366
We have a truly symbiotic relationship.

21:34.398 --> 21:39.275
No offence, but... why would any human
volunteer to be a host for a Goa'uld?

21:42.036 --> 21:45.819
<i>Uh, perhaps...
I can... I can help you?</i>

21:46.595 --> 21:48.920
I am Yosuuf. I am Garshaw's host.

21:48.953 --> 21:51.788
I speak freely without restraint or censor.

21:51.792 --> 21:55.957
All of us who serve as hosts
volunteer to do so freely.

21:55.913 --> 21:58.403
Maybe you can answer my question, then.

21:58.431 --> 22:01.965
Why would any human
volunteer for... for... that?

22:01.950 --> 22:07.619
Well, with the blending, I gain
all of Garshaw's knowledge, her wisdom.

22:07.509 --> 22:10.627
More than any human could ever attain.

22:10.627 --> 22:14.625
And my life span is twice
what it would be without the blending.

22:14.586 --> 22:17.421
And for all this, all I have to do is...

22:17.424 --> 22:20.047
...share my physical body.

22:20.065 --> 22:23.148
So you've got a little
Faustian deal going here.

22:23.144 --> 22:25.432
Selling your soul for immortality.

22:25.463 --> 22:28.914
Well, what you understand as "soul"
remains intact.

22:28.903 --> 22:33.611
So this symbiotic relationship is what
makes the Tok'ra differ from the Goa'uld?

22:33.540 --> 22:34.490
Yes.

22:34.579 --> 22:37.913
This has supported the Tok'ra's efforts
against the Goa'uld.

22:38.659 --> 22:40.781
Your Jaffa friend is correct.

22:40.817 --> 22:44.482
If you'd like to come with me,
I will show you what he means.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.013
Allow me to introduce...

23:04.050 --> 23:06.126
...Selmak.

23:06.171 --> 23:09.125
<i>Her host's name is Saroosh.</i>

23:09.128 --> 23:13.922
She is one of the oldest and wisest among
us. An important leader for our cause.

23:13.847 --> 23:17.512
However, she is unfortunately very ill,
and will soon die.

23:19.207 --> 23:20.487
How old is she?

23:20.566 --> 23:23.602
She will be 203 of your years
in a few of your days.

23:23.605 --> 23:28.230
I was under the impression that Goa'uld
lived much longer than 200 years.

23:28.163 --> 23:30.202
The Goa'uld do. The Tok'ra don't.

23:30.241 --> 23:34.868
- Because you don't use the sarcophagus.
- Correct. We believe to do so would...

23:34.801 --> 23:38.384
- ...drain the good from our hearts.
- I can vouch for that.

23:38.359 --> 23:41.361
That's why our numbers
don't grow large enough...

23:41.359 --> 23:44.894
...to defeat the massive forces
aligned with the System Lords.

23:44.878 --> 23:46.502
Zero population growth.

23:46.557 --> 23:51.135
Since you won't take new hosts by force,
mostly the Goa'uld dies with the host.

23:51.076 --> 23:53.483
And this is about to happen to Selmak.

23:54.954 --> 23:56.994
Unless...

23:57.035 --> 24:00.902
...one of you wishes to volunteer
to serve as a host.

24:07.511 --> 24:09.752
I'm gonna pass on that.

24:09.790 --> 24:14.749
Yes. Although it does sound... fascinating,
it's a little too long-term for me.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.622
I'm sorry. I've already been through that.

24:33.182 --> 24:36.432
<i>Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.</i>

24:36.423 --> 24:39.127
You shouldn't sneak up
on a person like that.

24:40.422 --> 24:44.465
We didn't mean to upset you
with the suggestion of becoming a host.

24:44.419 --> 24:46.992
Well, as long as
you take no for an answer.

24:47.019 --> 24:51.765
We have never forced a human to become
a host. It goes against all we believe in.

24:51.697 --> 24:55.612
You know, Captain Carter
didn't exactly invite Jolinar in.

24:55.576 --> 24:59.443
But he was sincere in wanting to leave me
once he found another host.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.790
If he found one.

25:00.855 --> 25:05.848
I'm curious. If you're not interested
in becoming a host, why seek us out?

25:05.773 --> 25:08.265
To form an alliance.

25:08.291 --> 25:12.704
So you said. But it's apparent that
the thought of an alliance disgusts you.

25:12.652 --> 25:16.815
Wait. You think by "form an alliance",
we mean we want to be hosts?

25:16.769 --> 25:21.395
What other sort of alliance would a
non-blended human and the Tok'ra want?

25:21.327 --> 25:25.242
Well, we do have a common enemy.
How about a friendship?

25:25.208 --> 25:29.039
- We could share information.
- Engage in battle side by side.

25:29.006 --> 25:32.422
<i>I do not believe
you can be of any service to us.</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:35.441
You are neither strong enough...

25:35.525 --> 25:36.983
...nor advanced enough.

25:37.044 --> 25:39.166
<i>- We're not?
- Incorrect.</i>

25:39.202 --> 25:42.536
It was these who destroyed
two Goa'uld mother ships.

25:42.521 --> 25:44.560
That was you?

25:44.602 --> 25:47.685
We had operatives who died
on board those vessels!

25:48.359 --> 25:51.859
- Oh, boy.
- We were only defending our planet.

25:52.877 --> 25:56.875
<i>We didn't know
they had travelled to the Tauri.</i>

25:56.836 --> 25:59.327
This information explains a lot.

25:59.356 --> 26:02.477
At least now we know
how and why our operatives died.

26:02.474 --> 26:04.468
For that, we are truly grateful.

26:04.515 --> 26:07.136
<i>So maybe we can be of service.</i>

26:07.153 --> 26:12.065
Perhaps you're correct. I'll try to convince
the Council of Tok'ra to meet with you.

26:14.271 --> 26:16.809
<i>Uh... Excuse me.</i>

26:16.830 --> 26:18.703
Are we prisoners here?

26:18.750 --> 26:23.211
Well... Until we decide what level
of information to entrust to you,...

26:23.148 --> 26:26.599
...um... we cannot allow you
to roam this facility freely.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.338
I'm sorry.

26:32.105 --> 26:34.857
Would you like to take a walk
on the surface?

26:34.865 --> 26:36.146
What?

26:36.224 --> 26:37.719
Why?

26:38.345 --> 26:41.630
I would like to hear more
of Jolinar of Malk-shur.

26:42.423 --> 26:45.507
- OK.
- Well, yeah, sure!

26:45.502 --> 26:49.547
I'm only inviting Captain Carter.
What we have to discuss is private.

26:49.500 --> 26:53.545
- I hope you understand.
- Actually, no, I don't.

26:56.019 --> 26:58.473
Colonel, I... I think I should go with him.

26:58.498 --> 27:03.326
I need to go with him. There's a lot of
questions he could answer about Jolinar.

27:05.895 --> 27:09.762
I assure you, sir,
she'll be very safe with me.

27:09.734 --> 27:11.526
Colonel...

27:11.574 --> 27:14.778
I need to do this. Please.

27:20.092 --> 27:22.132
OK, son.

27:22.170 --> 27:25.788
But I want you to have her back
by 11 o'clock. You understand?

27:28.328 --> 27:32.197
<i>- Feeling any better?
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

27:32.166 --> 27:34.409
<i>Please, tell me of Jolinar.</i>

27:34.447 --> 27:38.575
<i>I get the feeling
you knew him way better than I ever did.</i>

27:38.526 --> 27:40.565
Of that I am sure.

27:40.605 --> 27:44.222
<i>For one, he was a she.</i>

27:44.203 --> 27:46.243
What? You're kidding!

27:46.282 --> 27:48.654
Well, actually, that is inaccurate.

27:48.682 --> 27:50.805
The symbiote does not have a gender.

27:50.842 --> 27:54.886
However, Jolinar has always
been in female hosts.

27:54.840 --> 27:59.669
<i>Well, actually, the host I found him in
- Her in - was a male.</i>

27:59.598 --> 28:01.057
Really?

28:02.199 --> 28:05.864
Must have been another method
of hiding from the Ashrak.

28:08.557 --> 28:12.305
- Tell me of Jolinar's last days.
- Well, it's kind of weird.

28:12.276 --> 28:14.980
Like I'm left with these intuitions, feelings.

28:14.994 --> 28:19.787
I know this:
she sacrificed herself to save me.

28:19.712 --> 28:23.461
That speaks a ton about her character
as far as I'm concerned.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.324
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

28:37.346 --> 28:39.386
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28:39.426 --> 28:43.211
Martouf is having a more difficult time
handling this than I am.

28:43.184 --> 28:47.811
- So you're his symbiote. Lantash. Right?
- Yes. Martouf is the name of my host.

28:47.744 --> 28:49.572
Yeah, I knew that.

28:49.623 --> 28:52.327
I seem to know everything about you.

28:55.541 --> 28:58.542
When I'm with you,
I feel a different sort of...

28:58.540 --> 29:02.538
...I don't know... recognition
than I do with the other Tok'ra.

29:02.500 --> 29:06.082
Is something different
about your relationship to Jolinar?

29:06.058 --> 29:11.811
Jolinar and I were together for nearly...
one hundred of your years.

29:11.696 --> 29:13.736
She was my mate.

29:13.775 --> 29:15.602
Oh.

29:17.894 --> 29:20.221
How does that work?
She was whose mate?

29:20.253 --> 29:22.376
- Martouf or Lantash?
- Both.

29:30.570 --> 29:32.777
Now let me attempt an explanation.

29:34.569 --> 29:39.029
As I said before, ours is
a truly symbiotic relationship.

29:39.927 --> 29:42.383
So... what I feel,...

29:42.406 --> 29:44.445
...Lantash feels.

29:44.486 --> 29:47.771
And what Lantash feels, I feel.

29:47.766 --> 29:51.384
So... when one of you is in love,
you both feel it.

29:51.364 --> 29:55.362
Yes. We love as one, and...

29:55.323 --> 29:57.730
...and we mourn as one.

29:57.762 --> 30:00.882
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.171
We want you to truly comprehend this...

30:03.201 --> 30:05.739
...so that you'll better understand us.

30:05.759 --> 30:07.798
OK.

30:07.838 --> 30:09.878
Well, I am curious.

30:09.919 --> 30:12.836
What was Jolinar's host like?

30:14.757 --> 30:18.208
Jolinar's host Rosha was very beautiful.

30:18.195 --> 30:21.895
She had eyes like the oceans of Marloon.

30:21.875 --> 30:25.458
Hair was the colour of sand of Abydos.
And her smile was...

30:26.713 --> 30:28.836
...was as infectious as laughter.

30:31.592 --> 30:35.838
In fact, Rosha looked
very much like you, Captain Carter.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.830
You are very beautiful.

30:39.390 --> 30:42.260
You'd make a lovely new host for Selmak.

30:48.705 --> 30:52.406
I'm sorry. I...
I've said something to offend you.

30:52.385 --> 30:54.461
No. Yes!

30:55.825 --> 30:59.989
It's difficult enough with
just the remnants of Jolinar in here.

30:59.942 --> 31:04.190
The last thing I need is
another person - symbiote - whatever.

31:31.053 --> 31:33.093
I didn't mean to upset you so.

31:33.133 --> 31:36.218
It's just the thought of
going through that again.

31:36.211 --> 31:38.618
Don't give it another moment's thought.

31:38.651 --> 31:41.022
It was an inappropriate suggestion.

31:41.048 --> 31:45.546
Please, understand that it came from...

31:45.489 --> 31:50.067
...an honest, deep desire to have Jolinar
back in my life in some form.

31:54.365 --> 31:57.652
This must be what it feels like
to be schizophrenic.

31:58.605 --> 32:00.644
What is...

32:00.683 --> 32:02.723
...schizophrenic?

32:04.522 --> 32:06.730
It's a mental illness humans have.

32:06.761 --> 32:08.968
It's like a... split personality.

32:09.001 --> 32:11.040
Two people in... in one brain.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.157
I mean, there's me,...

32:13.200 --> 32:15.240
...Samantha Carter.

32:15.279 --> 32:19.989
And then there's this leftover part
of Jolinar that feels things like...

32:21.238 --> 32:23.278
Like...?

32:25.996 --> 32:28.487
Like some pretty deep feelings for you.

32:32.394 --> 32:35.063
Jolinar's left this imprint on your mind?

32:35.074 --> 32:36.236
Yes.

32:36.313 --> 32:38.804
I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable...

32:38.832 --> 32:40.872
No. It's just...

32:41.990 --> 32:45.240
What you had... you and Jolinar...

32:47.150 --> 32:50.020
You were in love
longer than I've been alive.

32:50.028 --> 32:52.152
Hell, longer than I will be alive!

32:54.747 --> 32:56.952
She left this feeling with you?

32:58.465 --> 33:01.171
You can feel how she felt for me?

33:01.184 --> 33:03.224
Yes.

33:03.265 --> 33:06.715
- And it's confusing the hell out of me.
- Why?

33:06.703 --> 33:09.871
Because it's not just in my mind,
like a memory.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.902
I feel it.

33:11.942 --> 33:15.726
<i>Like I've had this relationship
with you for a hundred years.</i>

33:15.700 --> 33:18.653
I don't know if I can describe it
with words.

33:21.577 --> 33:23.617
What Jolinar felt for you I...

33:24.657 --> 33:27.907
...I don't even think
I'm capable of comprehending.

33:27.896 --> 33:32.808
Maybe there's another way you can
communicate it. Perhaps in a way...

33:32.736 --> 33:34.776
...other than words.

33:47.010 --> 33:48.837
Sam!

33:50.090 --> 33:51.500
Daniel.

33:53.250 --> 33:55.490
Learning a lot about Jolinar?

33:58.406 --> 34:00.648
Yeah. You'd be surprised how much.

34:01.246 --> 34:04.330
Um... The Tok'ra Council's
agreed to meet with us.

34:04.326 --> 34:06.698
Jack thought you might wanna be there.

34:06.724 --> 34:08.717
Yeah.

34:19.161 --> 34:21.534
Quite the place you've got here.

34:23.199 --> 34:26.235
<i>Is it true
these facilities are grown?</i>

34:26.239 --> 34:30.367
It is. When we arrive at the new place,
we plant certain crystals...

34:30.317 --> 34:32.559
...and they grow into all that you see.

34:32.597 --> 34:34.221
Wow!

35:23.141 --> 35:25.347
<i>May I help you?</i>

35:25.380 --> 35:28.583
Uh... No, thanks. I was just lookin' around.

35:32.777 --> 35:35.813
This is not the way
to the new Council chambers.

35:38.217 --> 35:41.052
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

35:41.054 --> 35:44.259
But I would be happy to answer
any questions you have.

35:44.255 --> 35:46.295
These are my private quarters.

35:46.333 --> 35:48.954
Not very private.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.510
The Tok'ra hold no secrets
from each other.

35:51.532 --> 35:53.940
There is no need for doors or partitions.

35:56.170 --> 35:59.255
Can I show you back to your group?

36:00.369 --> 36:03.039
Uh, no. No, thanks. I...

36:05.168 --> 36:07.206
I can find my way back.

36:11.047 --> 36:13.715
How fast can you grow a facility like this?

36:13.726 --> 36:16.217
Quite rapidly. We build only as we need.

36:16.244 --> 36:20.871
That is why we are only now adding
the corridor, and the Council chambers.

36:20.804 --> 36:22.842
See for yourselves.

36:35.958 --> 36:38.664
What the hell...?

37:02.949 --> 37:04.989
This chamber is newly grown.

37:05.030 --> 37:08.648
Until now, we had no reason
to convene the Council of Tok'ra.

37:08.628 --> 37:12.579
- It's a sort of accelerated crystal growth.
- That is correct.

37:12.547 --> 37:17.090
We have learned to pattern
the natural tendencies of the crystal.

37:17.025 --> 37:19.599
Like a geode.

37:19.625 --> 37:22.293
People of the Tauri,
allow me to introduce...

37:22.304 --> 37:24.760
...the Grand Council of the Tok'ra.

37:36.699 --> 37:38.905
Hiya, folks. Nice to meet ya.

37:38.938 --> 37:43.932
Uh... We're very grateful. We're
representatives of a planet called Earth.

37:43.856 --> 37:46.773
It is an honour.

37:46.777 --> 37:51.983
The Council has reviewed your proposal
of an alliance between our peoples.

37:51.894 --> 37:52.891
And?

37:52.974 --> 37:55.762
<i>We would like you
to understand our situation.</i>

37:55.773 --> 37:59.023
We are an illegal resistance group
within the Goa'uld.

37:59.012 --> 38:02.630
We are the most hunted, most hated
enemies of the System Lords.

38:02.610 --> 38:06.360
Hey, we haven't made too many friends
along the way either.

38:06.329 --> 38:10.742
The secrets of the Tok'ra would never be
revealed. It is not the way of the Tauri.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.974
Not intentionally.
But you might be followed to us.

38:13.967 --> 38:19.472
You might be tortured to reveal where we
are, or a spy might appear in your midst.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.737
We would like to know
what you can offer us...

38:21.766 --> 38:24.719
...that is of sufficient value
to justify our exposure.

38:27.003 --> 38:31.831
- Well, I think we've got a lot of things.
- The Tauri have become quite advanced.

38:31.762 --> 38:34.050
I'm sure we have something
you could use.

38:34.081 --> 38:36.702
Please, give us an example.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.047
Sure. Daniel?

38:40.920 --> 38:42.958
Uh... Well, I mean, after all,...

38:42.998 --> 38:45.371
...we have the same goals in mind.

38:45.398 --> 38:47.936
Perhaps some technology
could be of use.

38:47.958 --> 38:52.038
Technology other than our own
is useless to us.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.447
We are infiltrators.
We work from within the Goa'uld.

38:55.434 --> 38:59.599
<i>Therefore it's important
that we appear to be Goa'uld.</i>

39:01.713 --> 39:03.373
Bring them in!

39:03.432 --> 39:05.472
What are you people planning?

39:06.952 --> 39:08.411
Beg your pardon?

39:08.471 --> 39:11.554
The Chaapa-ai just activated
and brought forth these!

39:15.509 --> 39:17.085
SG-3.

39:21.226 --> 39:23.266
Colonel Makepeace?

39:23.626 --> 39:25.666
What are you doing here?

39:25.706 --> 39:28.327
General Hammond sent us
to extract Captain Carter.

39:28.344 --> 39:29.969
Why?

39:30.025 --> 39:32.349
I'm afraid it's your father, Captain.

39:32.385 --> 39:35.219
He's in the hospital in a serious condition.

39:43.061 --> 39:45.302
You have to let her go home.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.811
I'm sorry, I cannot do that.

39:48.860 --> 39:52.773
- Why not?
- I'm afraid we have made our decision.

39:52.737 --> 39:56.485
We have decided not to accept
your request for an alliance.

39:56.456 --> 40:01.331
You shall be our guests until such time
as we decide to move to another planet.

40:01.253 --> 40:04.373
<i>- What?
- I'm sure you understand.</i>

40:04.373 --> 40:07.992
Your knowledge of this planet
makes you a security risk.

40:07.972 --> 40:09.715
We cannot allow you to leave until we

40:09.731 --> 40:12.306
move somewhere you
do not know about.

40:12.291 --> 40:15.791
Surely, as Tok'ra,
you're more compassionate than that.

40:15.769 --> 40:18.972
<i>Captain Carter's father is dying.
At least let her go.</i>

40:18.969 --> 40:24.724
She is the highest risk of all. She contains
the memory of Jolinar of Malk-shur.

40:24.608 --> 40:27.893
<i>We are not the only ones
who know of this planet.</i>

40:27.887 --> 40:32.014
Those we left behind on the Tauri
also possess this knowledge.

40:31.965 --> 40:34.289
As evidenced by our friends here.

40:36.083 --> 40:38.871
It is our wish that your lack of return...

40:38.882 --> 40:42.880
...will convince them
that we are Goa'uld and not Tok'ra.

40:42.842 --> 40:46.969
- You want them to think that we're dead.
- Well, that kinda sucks.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.960
I'm sorry.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.701
We will try to make you
as comfortable as possible.
