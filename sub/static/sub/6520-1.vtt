01:05.068 --> 01:08.526
Bum buttery, flit fluttery
Dum diddly-ooh

01:08.738 --> 01:12.037
Bum buttery, bluebird
Is singing a tune

01:12.242 --> 01:15.575
Daffy-down-dillies awaken
And prune

01:15.778 --> 01:18.679
Bursting in bloom
All the flowers assume

01:18.882 --> 01:22.943
It's a loverly, loverly spring

01:30.159 --> 01:33.754
Chit-chattery chipmunks
All singing along

01:33.963 --> 01:37.057
Humming their
Join-in-a-spring-along song

01:37.267 --> 01:40.065
Spring is the springiest time
For a song

01:40.270 --> 01:43.569
It's a loverly, loverly spring

01:43.806 --> 01:47.970
In the forest we play
With the rabbits all day--

01:48.211 --> 01:52.204
I'm sorry to say that this is not
the movie you will be watching.

01:52.682 --> 01:57.051
The movie you are about to see
is extremely unpleasant.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.811
If you wish to see a film
about a happy little elf,

02:00.056 --> 02:03.321
I'm sure there is still plenty
of seating in theater number two.

02:03.526 --> 02:06.188
However, if you like stories
about clever

02:06.429 --> 02:08.624
and reasonably attractive orphans,

02:08.865 --> 02:12.323
suspicious fires,
carnivorous leeches,

02:12.535 --> 02:15.527
Italian food
and secret organizations,

02:15.772 --> 02:17.262
then stay

02:17.540 --> 02:19.667
as I retrace each and every one

02:19.876 --> 02:22.845
of the Baudelaire children's
woeful steps.

02:23.780 --> 02:26.544
My name is Lemony Snicket,

02:26.749 --> 02:29.946
and it is my sad duty
to document this tale.

02:31.454 --> 02:33.251
Violet Baudelaire, the eldest,

02:33.456 --> 02:37.449
was one of the finest 14-year-old
inventors in the world.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.661
Anyone who knew Violet well could
tell she was inventing something

02:40.964 --> 02:43.899
when her long hair was tied up
in a ribbon.

02:44.767 --> 02:48.567
In a world of abandoned items
and discarded materials,

02:48.805 --> 02:51.797
Violet knew there
was always something.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.369
Something she could fashion
into nearly any device

02:54.577 --> 02:56.977
for nearly every occasion.

02:57.547 --> 03:00.914
And no one was better
to test her inventions

03:01.718 --> 03:02.844
than her brother.

03:04.420 --> 03:09.119
Klaus Baudelaire, the middle child,
loved books.

03:09.359 --> 03:12.021
Or, rather, the things he learned
from books.

03:12.328 --> 03:15.820
The Baudelaire parents had
an enormous library in their mansion.

03:16.132 --> 03:20.466
A room filled with thousands
of books on nearly every subject.

03:20.770 --> 03:22.533
And nothing pleased Klaus more

03:22.772 --> 03:27.471
than spending an afternoon filling up
his head with their contents.

03:27.777 --> 03:30.371
And everything he read
he remembered.

03:37.854 --> 03:42.086
Sunny, the youngest,
had a different interest.

03:42.291 --> 03:46.284
She liked to bite things
and had four sharp teeth.

03:47.363 --> 03:50.594
There was very little that Sunny
did not enjoy biting.

04:01.210 --> 04:03.041
Sunny was at an age when one
mostly speaks

04:03.246 --> 04:05.806
in a series of unintelligible shrieks.

04:06.049 --> 04:07.516
For instance:

04:08.117 --> 04:09.345
Which probably meant,

04:10.019 --> 04:13.318
''Look at that mysterious figure
emerging from the fog. ''

04:13.923 --> 04:15.652
Or perhaps,

04:15.858 --> 04:18.019
''What is a banker like Mr. Poe doing

04:18.261 --> 04:22.163
trudging thorough the sand
to find us at Briny Beach?''

04:26.035 --> 04:27.434
Children,

04:27.637 --> 04:32.540
I'm afraid I must inform you
of an extremely unfortunate event.

04:33.576 --> 04:37.137
I'm very, very sorry to tell you this,
but your parents have perished in a fire

04:37.346 --> 04:39.337
that's destroyed your entire home.

04:40.349 --> 04:43.045
If you have ever lost someone
very important to you,

04:43.352 --> 04:45.547
then you already know how it feels.

04:45.755 --> 04:47.086
And if you haven't,

04:47.457 --> 04:49.755
you cannot possibly imagine it.

04:59.135 --> 05:02.536
No one knows the precise cause
of the Baudelaire fire.

05:02.805 --> 05:05.433
My colleagues and I
have investigated the best we can.

05:05.641 --> 05:07.404
But all we've discovered
is that the blaze

05:07.610 --> 05:09.703
was started from a great distance

05:10.012 --> 05:12.845
through the refraction
and convergence of light.

05:13.149 --> 05:17.313
And within moments,
the entire mansion was in flames.

05:45.681 --> 05:48.445
And as mysterious as the source
of the blaze,

05:48.651 --> 05:52.553
other mysteries began to unfold
before the children's eyes.

05:53.089 --> 05:57.116
Every family has its secrets,
doors left unopened.

05:57.527 --> 05:59.324
But as Klaus now realized,

05:59.529 --> 06:03.590
the smallest discovery would send
his mind reeling with questions.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.101
What was this spyglass hidden
in his father's desk?

06:07.336 --> 06:11.295
Were there other secrets about their
parents' lives yet to be revealed?

06:11.607 --> 06:14.405
Questions he now feared
might never be answered.

06:15.611 --> 06:17.238
And just like that,

06:17.613 --> 06:21.606
the Baudelaire children
became the Baudelaire orphans.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.152
I tried to warn you.

06:34.864 --> 06:37.628
This is an excellent opportunity
to walk out of the theater,

06:37.833 --> 06:41.234
Iiving room or airplane
where this film is being shown.

06:42.538 --> 06:45.939
It's not too late to see a film
about a happy little elf.

06:46.943 --> 06:49.969
Yes. Come with me.

06:52.048 --> 06:55.347
Now, as chief officer
of Mulctuary Management

06:55.551 --> 06:57.280
and the executor of
your parents' estate,

06:57.486 --> 07:00.922
it is my legal obligation to take care
of your money till you come of age

07:01.190 --> 07:04.125
and to place you in the care
of your closest relative.

07:04.393 --> 07:07.123
So I'm taking you to live
with your dear Count Olaf,

07:07.396 --> 07:10.695
who resides right here in the city,
just 37 blocks away.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.491
I don't think that's what ''closest''
is supposed to mean.

07:13.703 --> 07:15.330
We don't know a Count Olaf.

07:15.538 --> 07:16.835
Yes, yes, of course you do.

07:17.039 --> 07:18.802
He's either your third cousin
four times removed

07:19.008 --> 07:20.532
or your fourth cousin
three times removed.

07:22.712 --> 07:25.806
And he's an actor by trade.
Isn't that exciting, children?

07:28.117 --> 07:30.210
You should count yourselves
lucky, children.

07:30.553 --> 07:33.818
This sort of generosity is rare
in a person of his profession.

07:39.128 --> 07:41.062
Here we are, your new home.

07:42.031 --> 07:44.022
Isn't it lovely, children?

07:46.068 --> 07:47.365
Oh, hello.

07:48.137 --> 07:49.764
You must be the Baudelaires.

07:49.972 --> 07:51.234
Hi.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.533
I was so sorry to hear
about the accident,

07:53.743 --> 07:56.041
but so happy to hear
you were coming here.

07:56.279 --> 07:58.474
Welcome. I'm Justice Strauss
of the city high court.

07:58.681 --> 08:02.310
I'm Violet. And this is my brother,
Klaus, and my sister, Sunny.

08:02.585 --> 08:04.678
Poe, Mulctuary Management.
How do you do?

08:04.920 --> 08:05.887
Lovely.

08:06.289 --> 08:08.189
Your house is so beautiful.

08:08.424 --> 08:09.482
Thank you.

08:09.725 --> 08:12.785
Please don't be strangers.
You come visit me anytime you like.

08:14.597 --> 08:15.928
- Visit?
- You mean,

08:16.132 --> 08:17.429
you don't live with Count Olaf?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.434
Live with--? With Count Olaf? No.

08:20.736 --> 08:24.433
No, no, no, no. He's--
He's my neighbor.

09:13.989 --> 09:15.980
Entrood.

09:25.301 --> 09:27.394
Haven't got all day. In you go.

09:31.307 --> 09:36.506
Well, hello, hello, hello.

09:36.712 --> 09:40.944
I am your beloved Count Olaf.

09:42.318 --> 09:46.652
And welcome to my loverly home.

09:46.922 --> 09:51.621
May you find solace within
the womblike warmth of its. . .

09:53.229 --> 09:54.924
. . .downy plume.

09:55.531 --> 09:59.729
Or as the Greeks
in the ancient times would say:

10:00.136 --> 10:01.626
Orphanis. . .

10:01.937 --> 10:03.928
. . .encribo. . .

10:04.373 --> 10:05.772
. . .something, something, something.

10:06.041 --> 10:11.638
Music builds to a crescendo
Ending on the right foot

10:11.847 --> 10:13.678
And strike a Fosse.

10:15.851 --> 10:20.083
Not exactly what I was going for,
but you get the idea.

10:29.598 --> 10:32.260
My dear. . .

10:35.004 --> 10:36.471
. . .Violet.

10:36.872 --> 10:38.669
Enchanté.

10:42.211 --> 10:43.803
How do you do?

10:44.380 --> 10:46.974
And this must be Klaus.

10:47.183 --> 10:50.277
Young Klaus.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.688
Your left side is the good one.

10:55.691 --> 10:57.420
And. . .

10:58.761 --> 11:00.626
. . .what is this?

11:03.332 --> 11:06.631
I'm sorry, I don't speak monkey.

11:07.169 --> 11:08.227
Banana.

11:10.473 --> 11:12.031
Sunny's our sister.

11:12.775 --> 11:17.144
I must say, you're a gloomy-looking
bunch. Why so glum?

11:18.347 --> 11:20.144
Our parents just died.

11:20.382 --> 11:24.148
Oh, yes, of course.
How very, very awful.

11:24.587 --> 11:26.885
Wait, let me do that one more time.

11:27.156 --> 11:30.148
Give me the line again.
Quickly, while it's fresh in my mind.

11:30.593 --> 11:32.788
Our parents just. . .

11:33.262 --> 11:34.194
. . .died?

11:36.565 --> 11:37.896
Oh, yes.

11:41.170 --> 11:42.899
Mr. Poe. . .

11:44.773 --> 11:47.298
. . .I will raise these orphans

11:47.576 --> 11:51.012
as if they were actually wanted.

11:51.780 --> 11:54.806
And though you would call it
a burden, a sacrifice,

11:55.017 --> 11:57.008
you are mistaken, sir.

11:57.219 --> 11:59.119
And should be ashamed of yourself.

11:59.321 --> 12:00.811
The idea.

12:04.927 --> 12:08.021
Anyway, where do I sign
for the fortu--? I mean. . .

12:08.564 --> 12:09.826
. . .children.

12:10.065 --> 12:15.367
You won't officially have guardianship
until the hearing on Thursday morning.

12:15.638 --> 12:18.471
And what am I to do with them
until then?

12:18.841 --> 12:19.830
Excuse me?

12:20.743 --> 12:21.835
What I mean is. . .

12:22.044 --> 12:25.480
Do you work out? You look good.
Healthy, I mean.

12:26.649 --> 12:29.083
Well, I'd better get back to the bank.

12:29.351 --> 12:32.479
Can't you stay for a brief imbibement?

12:32.755 --> 12:35.189
A glass of port? Sanka?

12:35.391 --> 12:37.291
- Well, I suppose I could--
- Another time, then.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.255
Children, if you need anything,
do feel free--

12:39.461 --> 12:41.053
Oh, no, we're fine. We're all fine.

12:41.263 --> 12:42.696
Any questions be--

12:47.403 --> 12:49.871
I realize that my humble abode

12:50.072 --> 12:53.405
isn't as fancy
as the Baudelaire mansion,

12:53.776 --> 12:56.870
but I'm coming into a great deal
of money soon,

12:57.046 --> 12:58.911
and I think it'll be

12:59.548 --> 13:02.016
quite charming when it's finished.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.911
Shall we take a look?

13:08.557 --> 13:11.025
This is the living room.

13:11.727 --> 13:14.423
The kitchen.
I know what you're thinking:

13:14.730 --> 13:17.028
''This place could use a little TLC.''

13:17.266 --> 13:21.726
I trust you've had your tetanus shots.
Polio. Smallpox. Typhoid. Malaria.

13:21.937 --> 13:24.132
This is the entertainment
or rumpus room.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.840
I'm told the ceiling can be brought
up to code in no time.

13:27.042 --> 13:29.067
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

13:29.645 --> 13:32.739
Imagine that.
A monkey afraid of heights.

13:33.349 --> 13:35.840
My theater.

13:36.051 --> 13:37.746
This way.

13:39.888 --> 13:41.480
What's that up there?

13:46.662 --> 13:48.095
The tower. . .

13:50.065 --> 13:52.363
. . .which you are never to enter. . .

13:54.670 --> 13:57.503
. . .under any circumstances.

14:05.347 --> 14:08.043
And this is where you'll sleep,
time permitting. Nighty-night.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.946
- But the sun's still up.
- ''But the sun's still up.''

14:11.420 --> 14:13.115
I don't know
if you've ever noticed this,

14:13.355 --> 14:16.916
but first impressions
are often entirely wrong.

14:17.626 --> 14:22.120
For instance, Klaus, when Sunny
was born, didn't like her at all.

14:22.731 --> 14:26.633
But by the time she was six weeks old,
the two of them were thick as thieves.

14:26.869 --> 14:32.171
A phrase which here means,
''fetching and biting for hours on end. ''

14:32.541 --> 14:34.168
In the case of Count Olaf, however. . .

14:34.476 --> 14:37.138
Orphans!

14:37.546 --> 14:39.138
. . . they were correct.

14:40.049 --> 14:42.847
Every morning, Count Olaf
would order the Baudelaires

14:43.052 --> 14:45.850
to do a great number
of terrible chores.

14:46.055 --> 14:49.991
After which he would stalk off
to his mysterious tower room.

14:57.833 --> 15:01.098
And as unfortunate
as their situation seemed,

15:01.804 --> 15:03.135
it was only about to get worse.

15:03.338 --> 15:04.999
--tub full of ice in Baja,

15:05.207 --> 15:07.835
and I realized that these clever girls
had stolen my kidney.

15:08.043 --> 15:09.510
- No!
- No!

15:09.712 --> 15:12.613
Imagine my surprise.

15:13.849 --> 15:16.841
Orphans, this is my acting troupe.

15:17.119 --> 15:19.110
Acting troupe, orphans.

15:19.421 --> 15:20.718
They don't look rich.

15:22.424 --> 15:24.551
Ugly little people.

15:29.331 --> 15:32.232
Why aren't you children in the kitchen
preparing our dinner?

15:32.835 --> 15:33.859
Dinner?

15:34.136 --> 15:36.627
It's the French word
for the evening meal.

15:40.576 --> 15:43.067
On the back. Flip it.

15:45.948 --> 15:47.882
We'll take it in the dining room
at 8:00.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.574
And we'll expect absolute silence
while we're rehearsing our play.

15:50.853 --> 15:53.788
- But we've never made dinner before.
- It's already 7:30.

15:54.056 --> 15:54.988
Eight o'clock!

16:13.809 --> 16:15.606
Pasta it is.

16:15.811 --> 16:19.542
Okay. Let's start casting this puppy.

16:21.817 --> 16:23.114
Now,

16:24.119 --> 16:25.950
who shall play

16:26.321 --> 16:29.757
the most handsome count
in all the world?

16:35.030 --> 16:36.964
Would you do it, sir?

16:37.966 --> 16:39.160
Oh, all right.

16:39.468 --> 16:43.029
''Pasta puttanesca.'' That's ltalian
for ''very few ingredients,'' you know.

16:43.338 --> 16:44.532
That's great.

16:45.841 --> 16:47.035
Sunny. Little help.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.243
- Okay, we're gonna need a pot.
- No pot.

16:51.446 --> 16:53.971
- And a strainer.
- No strainer.

16:55.450 --> 16:56.439
Thank you.

16:58.687 --> 16:59.779
And a saucepan.

17:00.088 --> 17:03.990
This is a little piece I like to call
''Electric Chair.''

17:09.498 --> 17:12.523
I think you might have to turn it up.

17:13.502 --> 17:15.128
Is anybody out there?!

17:18.507 --> 17:20.599
Strainer. That's brilliant.

17:20.809 --> 17:22.106
Sunny, how's that pot coming?

17:25.747 --> 17:30.650
Sunny, that's not a pot.
It's a spittoon.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.410
A spittoon? You mean, like. . .?

17:35.224 --> 17:36.316
We'll wash it twice.

17:39.628 --> 17:40.720
Well?

17:41.029 --> 17:42.929
It's good. It's really good.

17:43.131 --> 17:44.098
Time check.

17:44.733 --> 17:47.429
Let's go back to prehistoric times,

17:47.736 --> 17:50.933
when dinosaurs ruled the earth.

18:04.686 --> 18:07.177
Baudelaire orphans
to the courtesy desk.

18:07.422 --> 18:09.390
Baudelaire orphans
to the courtesy desk.

18:21.937 --> 18:22.995
What do you want?

18:23.639 --> 18:25.504
Dinner is served.

18:28.944 --> 18:30.036
Puttanesca.

18:30.412 --> 18:31.743
What did you call me?

18:32.247 --> 18:35.410
It's pasta. Pasta puttanesca.

18:35.651 --> 18:37.346
Where's the roast beef?

18:38.120 --> 18:39.610
Roast beef?

18:40.122 --> 18:41.749
Beef. Yes. Roast beef.

18:42.624 --> 18:45.923
It's the Swedish term for beef
that is roasted.

18:47.462 --> 18:50.158
But you didn't tell us
you wanted roast beef.

18:54.636 --> 18:59.403
You know, there's a big world out there
filled with desperate orphans

18:59.608 --> 19:02.168
who would gladly swim across
an ocean of thumbtacks

19:02.377 --> 19:07.576
just to be eclipsed by the long shadow
that is cast by my accomplishments.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.074
But I don't care about them.

19:10.686 --> 19:13.382
I chose to open my heart

19:13.822 --> 19:17.121
to you two loverly children

19:17.492 --> 19:19.585
and your hideous primate.

19:19.795 --> 19:23.231
All I ask in return is that you do each
and every thing that pops into my head

19:23.432 --> 19:27.596
while I enjoy the enormous fortune
your parents left behind.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.436
- No.
- Why, you litt--

19:45.921 --> 19:50.017
It's time you children learned
a little respect.

19:50.258 --> 19:51.350
You put her down!

19:54.129 --> 19:55.721
You monster!

19:59.067 --> 20:01.331
You all saw it. The boy slipped.

20:01.536 --> 20:04.027
You won't get a cent
until Violet turns 18.

20:04.673 --> 20:06.470
Oh, really?

20:07.042 --> 20:07.974
Says who?

20:08.243 --> 20:09.733
The law. Look it up.

20:09.945 --> 20:12.345
We're going to call Mr. Poe
about this right now.

20:20.455 --> 20:21.752
Are you?

20:24.559 --> 20:27.187
I'm very disappointed
in you, children.

20:30.365 --> 20:32.299
Where were we?

20:33.001 --> 20:34.366
Are you okay?

20:34.569 --> 20:36.059
No.

20:39.775 --> 20:41.072
Klaus, what are you doing?

20:41.309 --> 20:43.300
- I'm going.
- Going where?

20:43.512 --> 20:44.774
Home.

20:45.313 --> 20:47.372
This is our home now.

20:49.785 --> 20:51.480
This is not home.

20:51.987 --> 20:54.581
Home is where your parents
put you to bed at night.

20:54.890 --> 20:56.323
Where they teach you to ride a bike.

20:56.625 --> 20:59.719
Or where they get all choked up
on your first day of school.

20:59.928 --> 21:02.260
This is not home.

21:06.034 --> 21:07.865
How could they do this to us?

21:08.070 --> 21:09.230
They're just bad people.

21:09.771 --> 21:11.830
Not them. Mom and Dad.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.632
- Klaus!
- What?

21:13.842 --> 21:16.868
Violet, you're thinking it too.
How could they?

21:17.145 --> 21:18.772
They had no plan for us at all?

21:19.047 --> 21:21.140
Well, maybe they did have a plan.

21:21.950 --> 21:23.941
Well, sure looks like it to me.

21:31.793 --> 21:34.853
Do you remember
when Mom and Dad went to Europe?

21:35.864 --> 21:39.061
And we thought they'd abandoned us
because they didn't even write.

21:39.267 --> 21:40.962
Then we found out they'd written
a long letter.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.466
It had just gotten lost in the mail.

21:42.671 --> 21:46.163
Do you remember how guilty we felt
for thinking bad thoughts about them?

21:47.709 --> 21:48.869
This is just like that.

21:50.078 --> 21:51.477
No, it's not.

21:52.380 --> 21:53.608
Why?

21:55.917 --> 21:59.819
Because they're not in Europe.
They're not coming back.

22:07.028 --> 22:11.158
Do you think anything
will ever feel like home again?

22:24.746 --> 22:26.236
''Sanctuary''

22:26.548 --> 22:31.850
is a word which here means, ''a small,
safe place in a troubling world. ''

22:33.054 --> 22:38.048
Like an oasis in a vast desert
or an island in a stormy sea.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.090
The Baudelaires enjoyed their evening
in the sanctuary they'd built together.

22:41.296 --> 22:42.263
I see it. I see it.

22:42.464 --> 22:46.867
But in their hearts they knew that
the troubling world lay just outside.

22:47.068 --> 22:50.902
A world which, I'm sad to say,
can be described in two dismal words.

22:51.206 --> 22:53.071
Custody granted.

22:55.911 --> 22:59.506
Thank you, Your Honor.
Nice doing business with you.

23:06.555 --> 23:11.015
Children, I've been contemplating
our situation,

23:11.226 --> 23:16.425
and I realize that I've been
a bit standoffish, shall we say.

23:16.731 --> 23:19.029
Which in this case is a big,
big word meaning--

23:19.234 --> 23:20.565
Pure evil.

23:20.835 --> 23:23.326
--tough, but fair.

23:23.872 --> 23:26.568
But now that we're family,
I can make it up to you.

23:26.775 --> 23:29.938
I can be the ultimate dad.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.644
I know. Let's stop for a treat.

23:37.352 --> 23:38.944
Soda. Soda. Banana.

23:41.356 --> 23:42.550
Got it.

24:02.210 --> 24:06.203
Violet, where'd the locks go?

24:13.755 --> 24:17.521
Hello. I'm going on a perfectly
innocent ride in the country

24:17.726 --> 24:20.024
with my kids, whom I love.

24:20.262 --> 24:21.923
Is that clock correct?

24:28.036 --> 24:29.628
What is it?

24:30.639 --> 24:32.732
I think it's a schedule.

24:53.261 --> 24:57.823
Kiwi Watermelon Surprise. My favorite.

25:08.943 --> 25:10.103
Go!

25:15.817 --> 25:18.411
- He took the keys.
- Try everything.

25:26.828 --> 25:30.320
Chit-chattery chipmunks all singing--

25:33.368 --> 25:34.835
Count Olaf? Hello. Poe.

25:35.036 --> 25:37.971
I'm calling you back about
that inheritance question you raised.

25:38.239 --> 25:39.968
- Mr. Poe, thank goodness.
- Who is this?

25:40.241 --> 25:42.141
It's Violet Baudelaire.
We're in Count Olaf's car.

25:42.344 --> 25:44.141
Oh, hello, Violet.
Well, where's Count Olaf?

25:44.379 --> 25:45.471
He's not here right now, but--

25:45.747 --> 25:47.647
You're driving the car alone?

25:47.882 --> 25:50.646
No. We're-- The car's on the train
tracks, and the train is coming.

25:50.885 --> 25:55.345
I'm sorry, Violet, I can't hear a thing.
I'm driving next to a train!

25:55.590 --> 25:57.785
We're going to be hit by a train.

25:57.992 --> 26:01.484
Right. Yes. I can't hear
because of the train!

26:01.696 --> 26:04.995
I'll call you back when I get
to the bank! Goodbye!

26:10.705 --> 26:15.301
Klaus, you've read books on trains.
What do we do?

26:22.050 --> 26:23.347
The track switcher.

26:23.651 --> 26:24.811
There!

26:28.556 --> 26:29.648
It's too far away.

26:29.924 --> 26:32.825
No. There has to be something
we can use to pull it.

26:33.027 --> 26:35.962
- There's nothing in here.
- There's always something.

26:37.932 --> 26:39.832
Sunny, bite the head off that elf.

27:15.003 --> 27:16.095
Quick, pull it back in.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.610
- Violet.
- I got it.

27:24.913 --> 27:26.540
I don't mean to rush you.

27:32.821 --> 27:34.448
- Nice shot.
- Thank you. Pull.

28:35.750 --> 28:40.653
Mr. Poe. Dear Mr. Poe. Can't we
discuss this like reasonable men?

28:40.855 --> 28:42.254
I'm sorry, Count Olaf.

28:42.457 --> 28:44.425
Allowing a child of Sunny's age
to drive a car

28:44.659 --> 28:45.751
is simply not good parenting.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.018
He tried to kill us.

28:47.228 --> 28:50.527
Let us not exaggerate, Klaus.
The vehicle was not even in gear.

28:51.332 --> 28:56.031
May I have a moment
alone with the children?

29:00.675 --> 29:02.074
Goodbye, kids.

29:02.677 --> 29:04.201
It's been fun.

29:04.479 --> 29:06.276
I'm going to get you.
No matter where you go,

29:06.481 --> 29:09.473
no matter what you do, I'll find you.

29:09.918 --> 29:12.512
You are so deceased.

29:17.892 --> 29:19.587
Take them, Mr. Poe. . .

29:20.995 --> 29:23.293
. . .before I lose it, bigtime.

29:24.499 --> 29:26.091
Trumping a talentless villain

29:26.401 --> 29:29.529
might seem all in a day's work
for three ingenious orphans.

29:29.938 --> 29:32.202
But the Baudelaires
savored their victory

29:32.407 --> 29:35.035
as they sped
towards their new home.

29:35.310 --> 29:37.505
What lay ahead for them
was unclear,

29:37.745 --> 29:39.940
but they remained
cautiously optimistic

29:40.148 --> 29:43.208
that their next guardian would be
better than the last.

29:43.451 --> 29:47.114
Or at least wouldn't try
to flatten them with a train.

29:53.628 --> 29:56.722
Do you know
what kind of scientist he is?

29:56.931 --> 29:59.525
No, I don't. I was far too busy
making arrangements for you three.

29:59.734 --> 30:00.928
I didn't have time for chitchat.

30:01.169 --> 30:02.431
Hello!

30:03.137 --> 30:06.971
Oh, my goodness.

30:07.241 --> 30:10.074
Look at you. You must be Violet.

30:10.278 --> 30:12.473
Do you remember me?
I don't suppose so.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.739
You were just a little baby
at the time.

30:15.049 --> 30:18.246
And, Klaus, we've never met.
How do you d--?

30:18.953 --> 30:22.081
What a firm grip.
Like a Burmese python.

30:22.390 --> 30:27.692
And Sunny. Little Sunny. You look
so much like your dear mother.

30:28.162 --> 30:31.654
Thank you very much, Mr. Poe.
I'll take it from here.

30:32.367 --> 30:34.164
Oh, perhaps I should come inside.

30:34.369 --> 30:35.859
Oh, by all means.

30:36.671 --> 30:38.468
You could help us pick out
the gut worms

30:38.673 --> 30:40.470
from the bowel of the Viscid Boa.

30:41.109 --> 30:44.169
Children, remember,
if you need me anytime,

30:44.379 --> 30:47.815
you can reach me by phone or fax.

30:48.082 --> 30:49.208
Good day.

30:53.221 --> 30:55.189
Well, we got rid of him, didn't we?

30:55.490 --> 30:58.653
Come in. Come in. There's not
much time, and we have to pack.

30:59.827 --> 31:01.021
Pack?

31:03.464 --> 31:04.522
Did you say ''pack''?

31:04.732 --> 31:08.031
Oh, yes. We have to pack
all the equipment.

31:08.436 --> 31:10.836
Then there's the essentials,
like clothing and such.

31:11.039 --> 31:13.530
And we have to tag all of the snakes
who are coming with us.

31:13.741 --> 31:14.833
Coming where?

31:15.043 --> 31:17.170
Oh, did I mention we're going
to Peru?

31:17.378 --> 31:19.744
- No.
- Yes, we're going to Peru.

31:19.947 --> 31:23.178
Tomorrow morning.
Isn't that exciting?

31:23.451 --> 31:24.884
This way to the Reptile Room.

31:27.588 --> 31:30.557
Welcome to my humble abode.

31:30.958 --> 31:33.552
You children know anything
about snakes?

31:34.262 --> 31:35.889
Only what I've read in books.

31:36.297 --> 31:38.060
No, not very much.

31:38.766 --> 31:42.862
Well, we may have one or two things
here that aren't in books.

31:43.971 --> 31:48.567
I'll just put the big fellow in his bed and
introduce you to a few of me friends.

31:49.477 --> 31:50.910
Over here. . .

31:51.112 --> 31:52.409
That's the two-headed cobra.

31:52.613 --> 31:54.581
Well spotted.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.272
Is that a he or a she?

31:56.684 --> 31:59.050
I have no idea.
Didn't think it polite to ask.

31:59.620 --> 32:03.215
And over here,
the Tibetan Third-Eye Toad.

32:03.424 --> 32:06.825
We can't stop this fellow chanting.
Om. Ribbit.

32:07.228 --> 32:11.062
And now, children, you have
to see my latest discovery.

32:11.265 --> 32:16.066
Found him in Tanzania. One of a kind.
The lncredibly Deadly Viper.

32:16.738 --> 32:21.334
My assistant, Gustav, and I may be
the only people ever to have seen him.

32:48.069 --> 32:51.561
Oh, I'm sorry. My ribbon just jammed.

32:51.773 --> 32:53.764
Let me just adjust it here.

32:55.510 --> 32:56.477
Right.

32:56.677 --> 32:57.644
There we are.

32:57.945 --> 32:59.105
Now,

32:59.814 --> 33:00.940
where was I?

33:01.215 --> 33:03.911
Oh, yes. The attack
of the Incredibly Deadly Viper.

33:05.219 --> 33:08.313
Not to worry, little one.
You're all right.

33:08.523 --> 33:11.219
It can't possibly harm you.
Here we go.

33:11.559 --> 33:14.722
The lncredibly Deadly Viper
couldn't have possibly harmed her?

33:14.929 --> 33:16.658
No. No, no, no, no.

33:18.733 --> 33:20.223
It's a big softy.

33:20.535 --> 33:23.026
One of the least harmful
and most friendly creatures

33:23.237 --> 33:24.534
in the animal kingdom.

33:24.739 --> 33:25.865
It's a misnomer.

33:26.073 --> 33:29.440
I only called him that to play a prank
on those stuffed shirts

33:29.644 --> 33:31.635
down at the Herpetological Society.

33:31.879 --> 33:34.643
Uncle Monty,
why are we going to Peru?

33:35.082 --> 33:36.879
Just this morning I was wondering,

33:37.151 --> 33:39.346
''How are we all going to get
out of town together?''

33:39.587 --> 33:43.045
And I thought, ''Peru.''
They have snakes in Peru, don't they?

33:43.257 --> 33:45.748
But why are we getting out of town?

33:47.395 --> 33:51.354
Violet, do you know snakes are more
afraid of you than you are of them?

33:52.767 --> 33:54.257
Few people do.

33:55.069 --> 33:57.537
When threatened,
a snake will retreat to a place

33:57.738 --> 34:01.003
that is quiet, safe, remote.

34:02.109 --> 34:07.137
A sanctuary.
Where it can feel out of danger.

34:09.050 --> 34:10.710
That's why Peru.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.522
Wait, that spyglass.
I saw one just like that in our dad's--

34:17.725 --> 34:19.522
Plenty of time for chitchat later.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.524
But right now, what I need
is an inventor,

34:22.730 --> 34:24.061
a reader

34:24.264 --> 34:25.926
and a biter.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.225
Know any?

34:34.775 --> 34:39.268
High upon Highlands
And low upon Tay

34:40.581 --> 34:45.780
Bonnie George Campbell
Rode out on a day

34:46.786 --> 34:51.781
Saddled and bridled
So gallant rode he

34:52.659 --> 34:57.597
Home came his good horse
But never came he

34:59.934 --> 35:03.597
Petunia, what have I told you
about this?

35:03.804 --> 35:06.102
She thinks I'm a tree, you know.

35:06.908 --> 35:11.709
I think I know that song. I think-- I think
our parents used to play it for us.

35:11.913 --> 35:15.041
They certainly did. As I did for mine.

35:15.249 --> 35:17.740
- You had children?
- Oh, yes.

35:18.452 --> 35:20.818
And a wife and a home.

35:22.523 --> 35:23.615
Until the fire.

35:25.026 --> 35:26.323
A fire?

35:27.828 --> 35:30.820
I may know better than anyone
what you're going through.

35:32.333 --> 35:33.925
But it's gonna be all right.

35:34.468 --> 35:38.962
We'll be among people who
understand us. People who are like us.

35:39.473 --> 35:41.634
People who appreciate
unique children

35:41.842 --> 35:47.144
who can read and invent
and bite things.

35:49.550 --> 35:52.644
Uncle Monty, why are you doing
all this for us?

35:54.355 --> 35:56.482
Isn't that what family does?

35:57.325 --> 36:00.783
''And so the Baudelaire children
went to Peru

36:00.995 --> 36:02.724
and together had
wonderful adventures

36:02.930 --> 36:06.297
with their loving
and wonderful new guardian.

36:07.001 --> 36:08.992
The end. ''

36:10.805 --> 36:13.501
These are the words
I desperately wish I could type.

36:13.808 --> 36:18.108
Oh, I would give anything
to say that the story ends here.

36:18.312 --> 36:21.008
But alas, my mission is
not to weave happy endings

36:21.182 --> 36:24.515
where they do not occur
but to report the actual events

36:24.719 --> 36:27.847
in the lives of the unfortunate
Baudelaire children.

36:28.856 --> 36:30.721
And as much as it pains me,

36:30.925 --> 36:34.725
I must confess that their troubles
had only just begun.

36:34.929 --> 36:38.023
And it did so with two musical notes.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.542
Hello.

36:54.749 --> 36:59.379
I am looking
for Dr. Montgomery Montgomery.

37:01.188 --> 37:04.680
I am Stephano. I am an ltalian man,

37:05.026 --> 37:10.328
and I am here to assist him
in his research as best I can.

37:10.531 --> 37:14.695
As well as to facilitate
and remain observatory.

37:14.902 --> 37:16.392
You're Count Olaf.

37:21.609 --> 37:25.010
Now, why would you say
something like that?

37:25.546 --> 37:29.243
I have never met such a person
as a Count Olaf,

37:29.550 --> 37:31.916
but if I had,

37:32.119 --> 37:36.715
I'm sure he would look and sound
completely different.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.251
You're Olaf,
and we're not letting you in.

37:45.332 --> 37:49.928
Well, perhaps you should re-evaluate
your hypothesis.

37:50.638 --> 37:54.631
Anyway, that's why you should
never run with one of these, kids.

37:54.842 --> 37:57.402
Words of wisdom indeed,
Mr. Stephano.

37:57.611 --> 38:00.205
Oops, you caught me being
a mentor.

38:00.481 --> 38:03.416
And bless you for coming
at such short notice.

38:03.684 --> 38:05.276
Not at all, not at all.

38:05.519 --> 38:09.387
My chief assistant, Gustav, took sick
and phoned not one hour ago.

38:09.590 --> 38:12.081
He'd give anything
to be here right now.

38:15.696 --> 38:17.596
Thank goodness you were available.

38:17.832 --> 38:22.735
Well, I am a fan, if I may gush.

38:23.003 --> 38:26.234
Your work has profoundly influenced
my research

38:26.440 --> 38:29.603
up at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. . .

38:31.312 --> 38:32.609
. . .on the sea snake.

38:33.214 --> 38:35.739
It's a very volatile animal.

38:36.050 --> 38:41.352
- Perhaps we should--
- I've been bitten 43. . . 700 times.

38:41.922 --> 38:43.355
Mostly on the face.

38:43.557 --> 38:46.526
A lot of this has been reconstructed.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.317
But I think they did one heck of a job,

38:48.529 --> 38:51.828
even though my mustache
is a tad askew.

38:55.035 --> 38:58.402
I wonder if I could get the kids
to help me in with my bags.

38:58.672 --> 39:01.766
My left side is somewhat
neurologically challenged.

39:02.009 --> 39:03.670
- But of course. Children--
- Uncle Monty--

39:03.978 --> 39:08.074
Please. Let us not be rude
to our guest.

39:08.382 --> 39:09.576
Now, go on.

39:10.885 --> 39:12.284
What's he up to?

39:12.486 --> 39:13.475
I don't know.

39:13.721 --> 39:18.124
There is no good moment, of course,
for a notorious villain to arrive.

39:18.325 --> 39:20.293
But the timing
of Olaf's reappearance,

39:20.494 --> 39:23.986
just when Dr. Montgomery's secret
could be revealed to the children,

39:24.198 --> 39:26.894
was almost more
than Klaus could bear.

39:27.101 --> 39:28.398
Violet, listen to me.

39:28.836 --> 39:32.135
Monty's spyglass. I saw
the exact same one in Dad's desk.

39:32.940 --> 39:35.909
- Klaus, it's just a coincidence.
- Violet, no.

39:36.110 --> 39:38.010
Everything happens for a reason.

39:38.212 --> 39:41.511
Now, the children will be helping us
extensively with the research in Peru.

39:41.715 --> 39:43.148
Do you have experience
with children?

39:43.417 --> 39:46.648
Children are strange
and foreign to me.

39:47.621 --> 39:49.020
I never really was one.

39:49.223 --> 39:52.624
I know that they are
an important part of the ecosystem.

39:52.927 --> 39:54.827
He's never gonna let us alone
with Monty.

39:55.029 --> 39:56.428
We've gotta get a message to him.

39:57.131 --> 39:58.530
Leave that to me.

39:59.833 --> 40:02.028
I was feeding the moray,

40:02.469 --> 40:06.235
and of course, I got cocky.

40:06.440 --> 40:10.274
And that's all it takes.
That's all it takes, is one time.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.240
Just once.

40:14.481 --> 40:17.245
I had the kipper in my mouth,
and I offered it.

40:17.551 --> 40:20.987
And there was a team from
National Geographic that were there.

40:21.255 --> 40:22.586
They were filming the whole thing.

40:22.790 --> 40:26.282
And, well, a lot of people don't
know this about the moray,

40:26.560 --> 40:29.256
but you think, you know, ''This can't be
a tremendously strong animal.''

40:29.463 --> 40:31.761
I mean, sure, it has a certain amount
of strength,

40:31.966 --> 40:35.299
but how does it pull a man's face
into a cave?

40:35.803 --> 40:37.964
Anyway, long story short,

40:38.205 --> 40:40.503
the bends,
a reconstructive surgery. . .

40:40.708 --> 40:45.873
But yes, from my understanding,
Peru is a wonderful place.

40:46.180 --> 40:48.011
The beaches. The people.

40:48.282 --> 40:49.476
The relaxed guardianship laws.

40:50.918 --> 40:52.818
Relaxed guardianship laws?

40:54.588 --> 40:56.021
Did I say that?

40:57.558 --> 40:58.923
Darn neurotoxins.

40:59.326 --> 41:03.660
Oh, Stephano, you have
a wonderful gift for storytelling.

41:03.964 --> 41:06.660
- Doesn't he, children?
- Oh, yeah.

41:06.867 --> 41:09.927
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
milking Petunia for me.

41:10.137 --> 41:15.439
Petunia. Well, the milking. . .
Now, see, what I was--

41:15.643 --> 41:16.837
Could I just. . .?

41:17.044 --> 41:19.945
Yeah, sure. I'll take a shot at that.

41:20.381 --> 41:24.044
Now, they used to call me Old
MacDonald up at the milking lab there,

41:24.251 --> 41:26.185
because I'd milk these things
all day long.

41:26.453 --> 41:30.184
But the little udders
are hard to locate.

41:31.759 --> 41:34.751
Anyway, why don't you take that

41:34.962 --> 41:37.760
and go ahead and start the party
without me, and then. . .

41:38.065 --> 41:43.059
I'm not sure I brought my milking gear.
I'll take a gander.

41:54.581 --> 41:55.878
Is he still watching?

41:57.217 --> 41:58.309
Yes.

41:58.819 --> 42:00.753
Don't look at me.
Pretend you're talking to Klaus.

42:01.021 --> 42:02.818
Okay.

42:03.023 --> 42:06.322
I got your message.
Don't worry. I know.

42:06.527 --> 42:08.518
- You do?
- Yes.

42:08.729 --> 42:11.664
A moray eel would never eat kippers.
Far too salty.

42:12.032 --> 42:14.364
And did you see the way he kept
glancing into my satchel,

42:14.568 --> 42:16.729
where I keep
the exotic snake venoms?

42:17.037 --> 42:20.939
You children were right.
Stephano is an imposter.

42:21.141 --> 42:22.130
Yes.

42:22.343 --> 42:24.038
He's a spy from
the Herpetological Society.

42:24.244 --> 42:26.439
He's here to steal
the lncredibly Deadly Viper.

42:26.680 --> 42:27.647
- No.
- No. Uncle Monty--

42:30.150 --> 42:35.452
Darn. All finished. I was
so looking forward to the milking.

42:36.357 --> 42:38.689
Isn't it about time you kids
went to bed?

42:38.892 --> 42:42.851
Absolutely.
Early start tomorrow, children.

42:43.063 --> 42:44.291
Off you go.

42:45.265 --> 42:46.391
Good night.

42:51.872 --> 42:55.467
Oh, and if you kids should get
restless during the night,

42:55.776 --> 42:59.405
I'm right down the hall,
and I'm a very light sleeper.

42:59.713 --> 43:04.116
In fact, I hardly sleep at all.

43:16.163 --> 43:18.324
Do you have a hall pass?

43:21.935 --> 43:23.835
I didn't think so.

43:24.638 --> 43:28.472
Oh, Petunia, I'm going to miss you.

43:29.743 --> 43:32.837
You're such a good girl, aren't you?

43:33.747 --> 43:35.374
Such a pretty girl.

43:35.949 --> 43:39.248
You are. Yes, you are.

43:41.288 --> 43:43.882
Oh, yes, you are.

43:45.292 --> 43:48.193
It is a curious thing,
the death of a loved one.

43:50.464 --> 43:52.056
Uncle Monty?

43:52.266 --> 43:55.201
It's like walking up the stairs
to your bedroom in the dark

43:55.402 --> 43:58.701
and thinking that there's
one more stair than there is.

43:59.339 --> 44:01.500
Your foot falls down through the air,

44:01.708 --> 44:04.905
and there's a sickly moment
of dark surprise.

44:07.047 --> 44:08.036
Uncle Monty?

44:13.821 --> 44:16.312
The children's grief
was not only for their uncle

44:16.623 --> 44:20.115
but for that tender hope that they
may have found home again.

44:20.427 --> 44:23.521
A hope which, thanks to a villainous
actor, was now slowly tumbling away.

44:29.837 --> 44:32.635
I do feel somewhat responsible
for this tragedy.

44:32.840 --> 44:36.037
I should've taken it upon myself
to warn him

44:36.276 --> 44:37.834
that the lncredibly Deadly Viper

44:38.045 --> 44:41.037
is the most deadly snake
in the entire ecosystem.

44:41.248 --> 44:44.240
I should know. I discovered it.

44:44.451 --> 44:45.782
You what?

44:46.053 --> 44:47.281
Detective?

44:48.188 --> 44:52.147
Little girl, the big cage door is open,
no snake. Dead guy.

44:52.359 --> 44:53.587
You know what I'm thinking?

44:53.794 --> 44:56.661
I'm thinking, ''Who woke me up
at 9 in the morning for this?''

44:57.297 --> 45:00.095
It's definitely a snake bite.
There's no question about it.

45:00.300 --> 45:02.097
Snake bite, no question about it.
Thanks, doc.

45:02.336 --> 45:05.203
You don't understand, the lncredibly
Deadly Viper couldn't have killed him,

45:05.405 --> 45:07.896
because it's one of the least dangerous
and most friendly creatures

45:08.108 --> 45:09.302
in the animal kingdom.

45:09.610 --> 45:11.305
You mind if I skip the paperwork
on this?

45:11.612 --> 45:15.912
I think that'd be best. These kids
have been through a major upheaval.

45:16.517 --> 45:19.953
I wonder if it's a good idea, even,
to change their plans at this point.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.914
We were headed for Peru tomorrow,

45:23.156 --> 45:25.522
- and the tickets are nonrefundable.
- No.

45:25.726 --> 45:26.715
Doc, what do you think?

45:26.960 --> 45:29.520
Could be the only chance
for them to get closure.

45:30.864 --> 45:32.229
Closure. Thank you, doc.

45:32.432 --> 45:34.525
From interviews with witnesses
who were there that day,

45:34.735 --> 45:38.364
I have learned the following about
the youngest Baudelaire's plan:

45:38.639 --> 45:40.368
Brave Sunny started here

45:40.641 --> 45:42.336
and approached
the Incredibly Deadly Viper

45:42.543 --> 45:44.636
with single-minded determination.

45:44.945 --> 45:48.142
No, he's Count Olaf,
and that doctor is his accomplice.

45:48.348 --> 45:49.747
He tried to kill us with a train.

45:49.950 --> 45:52.976
- And where would this man get a train?
- Where am I gonna get a train?

45:53.287 --> 45:54.879
Children, that's enough
of this foolishness.

45:55.188 --> 45:57.918
Mr. Stephano bears absolutely
no resemblance to Count Olaf.

45:58.125 --> 46:01.788
Who is this incredibly handsome
Count Olaf they keep speaking of?

46:01.995 --> 46:05.726
Count Olaf is their old guardian,
who made an error in judgment.

46:06.500 --> 46:10.436
What about the tattoo? Count Olaf
had a tattoo of an eye on his ankle.

46:11.138 --> 46:13.106
Anything for the kids.

46:14.841 --> 46:17.605
Voilà! Spick-and-span.

46:17.911 --> 46:19.936
Well, he's an actor.
He covered it with makeup.

46:22.015 --> 46:24.643
Doctor, I wonder if you
could help me escort

46:24.918 --> 46:27.318
- these young children to the vehicle.
- No. Mr. Poe--

46:27.521 --> 46:29.250
- No, Mr. Poe!
- I'll send you a postcard.

46:29.456 --> 46:31.617
About one thing,
all the witnesses agreed.

46:31.858 --> 46:36.625
The sound they heard next
was so shocking, so surprising,

46:36.863 --> 46:39.229
it still haunts them to this day.

46:49.076 --> 46:53.342
Damn it. This was
such a good character.

47:15.502 --> 47:18.494
Bum buttery, bluebird is singing a tune

47:18.705 --> 47:23.039
Rest assured, children, the authorities
are in hot pursuit of Mr. Stephano,

47:23.243 --> 47:26.735
from his eyebrowless forehead
to his untattooed ankle.

47:27.147 --> 47:28.842
The ltalian fiend.

47:29.049 --> 47:31.517
Though still in the clutches
of a clueless banker,

47:31.718 --> 47:34.346
the Baudelaires celebrated
their unmasking of Count Olaf

47:34.621 --> 47:38.421
as they skimmed their way across
the icy surface of Lake Lachrymose.

47:38.725 --> 47:42.525
But Klaus wasn't the sort to think
on the surface of anything.

47:42.729 --> 47:44.924
He knew there was something
beneath their journey,

47:45.132 --> 47:47.828
even though all he had to go on
was a spyglass,

47:48.035 --> 47:52.335
the knowledge of another terrible fire
and two words on a slip of paper.

47:52.539 --> 47:54.530
Aunt Josephine?

47:55.142 --> 47:56.837
Never heard of her.

47:58.311 --> 48:02.179
Does it strike you as odd that none
of our relatives are related to us?

48:18.932 --> 48:20.490
Aunt Josephine?

48:22.402 --> 48:25.200
Baudelaires? Is that you?

48:25.405 --> 48:26.599
Yes.

48:28.108 --> 48:29.405
Oh, good.

48:29.710 --> 48:30.699
Come in. Come in. Come in.

48:30.911 --> 48:34.039
Hurricane Herman
is about to arrive at any time now.

48:35.916 --> 48:39.215
Oh, Violet. Look at you.

48:39.453 --> 48:40.715
Hello.

48:40.921 --> 48:42.912
Come in, quickly. Quickly, children.

48:43.123 --> 48:44.454
- What? What?
- What's the matter?

48:44.758 --> 48:48.717
Not that quickly. You could trip
over the welcome mat

48:49.029 --> 48:50.326
and decapitate yourselves.

48:51.631 --> 48:56.261
So, quickly, but not too quickly,
all right?

49:10.484 --> 49:13.510
I'm sorry it's so chilly in here.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.686
Sometimes it gets so cold
I can hardly stand it.

49:17.991 --> 49:20.585
Would you like me to turn the radiator
up for you, Aunt Josephine?

49:20.927 --> 49:25.091
Oh, no. I never turn on the radiator.
I'm frightened that it might explode.

49:26.299 --> 49:30.497
Children, I must ask you not to use
any of the doorknobs in the house.

49:31.204 --> 49:35.903
Just push on the wood of the door,
and it'll open.

49:36.309 --> 49:37.241
Why?

49:37.711 --> 49:39.736
Well, I'm always afraid
that the doorknobs

49:39.946 --> 49:41.641
will shatter into a million tiny pieces,

49:41.848 --> 49:43.611
and one of them will hit my eye.

49:48.522 --> 49:50.752
''Delmo'' is not a word.

49:51.358 --> 49:54.919
I can see that I'm going to have to
teach her proper English.

50:00.534 --> 50:04.527
Grammar is the greatest joy in life,
don't you find?

50:04.738 --> 50:06.035
- Most definitely.
- I love grammar.

50:15.182 --> 50:16.843
Perfect. Nice hot soup.

50:17.551 --> 50:20.850
Actually, it's chilled cucumber soup.

50:21.087 --> 50:22.486
I never cook anything hot.

50:22.756 --> 50:25.589
I'm afraid that the stove
will burst into flames.

50:25.959 --> 50:26.983
Where's your brother?

50:27.561 --> 50:28.550
The kitchen.

50:29.262 --> 50:30.251
Klaus?

50:31.565 --> 50:32.759
What are you doing?

50:33.266 --> 50:34.198
Napkins.

50:35.268 --> 50:39.568
Napkins are here. Come away from
the fridge. If it falls, it'll crush you flat.

50:41.274 --> 50:42.571
All right.

50:43.076 --> 50:45.977
Everyone, would you like
to see some pictures?

50:49.816 --> 50:51.784
Careful. Don't get a paper cut.

50:55.288 --> 50:56.277
Is this lke?

50:58.425 --> 50:59.722
Wasn't he handsome?

51:04.431 --> 51:06.729
All the things you did,
Aunt Josephine.

51:07.434 --> 51:08.731
You tamed lions?

51:09.469 --> 51:14.736
Oh, I was quite adventurous
when lke was alive.

51:29.289 --> 51:31.951
Uncle Monty?
You knew Uncle Monty?

51:32.158 --> 51:34.786
No. That's not a good picture of me.

51:35.061 --> 51:37.586
Wait, is. . .? Is that our parents?

51:37.797 --> 51:39.594
Was this some sort of club?

51:40.000 --> 51:42.264
Why do you all have
these spyglasses?

51:42.469 --> 51:47.270
I don't like the way I look
in that picture.

51:51.378 --> 51:53.505
Did lke die in a fire?

51:53.880 --> 51:57.008
No, no, no, no. Silly child, no.

51:57.817 --> 51:59.910
He was eaten by leeches.

52:03.323 --> 52:04.620
Come, I'll show you.

52:10.030 --> 52:14.524
Watch the chandelier, children.
If it falls, it will impale you.

52:34.854 --> 52:40.156
Ike and I explored every cove and inlet
of Lake Lachrymose,

52:40.360 --> 52:42.851
from Horrid Harbor,

52:43.063 --> 52:47.898
all the way over to Curdled Cave,
way over there.

52:48.401 --> 52:51.564
And near that rock is
where the leeches attacked.

52:55.275 --> 52:57.140
Lachrymose leeches have six rows

52:57.344 --> 53:00.006
of very sharp teeth,
and one very sharp nose.

53:00.313 --> 53:04.647
They are blind, but they can smell food
on a human from miles away.

53:04.851 --> 53:08.947
And if they smell food,
they will swarm.

53:12.225 --> 53:17.527
I told him, ''lke, you must wait one hour
before going into the water.''

53:18.064 --> 53:19.224
But. . .

53:20.233 --> 53:24.533
. . .he only waited 45 minutes,

53:24.738 --> 53:25.932
and. . .

53:34.748 --> 53:37.581
I apologize, children.

53:38.385 --> 53:39.682
Klaus!

53:40.253 --> 53:43.450
That area is private.
That was lke's room.

53:47.460 --> 53:50.395
Oh, God, I hate it here.

53:52.265 --> 53:55.701
Well, Aunt Josephine,
have you ever thought

53:55.902 --> 53:57.335
of maybe moving someplace else?

53:57.537 --> 54:01.200
Maybe if you moved away from Lake
Lachrymose you might feel better.

54:02.308 --> 54:04.333
I could never,

54:04.611 --> 54:08.843
never, never, never sell this house.

54:10.216 --> 54:12.514
I'm terrified of realtors.

54:12.919 --> 54:15.251
There are two kinds of fears:

54:15.622 --> 54:18.455
rational and irrational.

54:19.125 --> 54:22.424
Being afraid of realtors
is an irrational fear.

54:22.629 --> 54:24.062
Is this a bad time?

54:29.636 --> 54:31.433
We gotta get her out of the house.

54:39.145 --> 54:43.343
Watch out for those avocados. The pit
could become lodged in our throats.

54:43.650 --> 54:48.144
And watch out for that cart.
It could break free and run us over.

54:49.355 --> 54:51.585
Everything's fine, Aunt Josephine.

54:52.092 --> 54:54.890
Lord thundering jumped-up Jehovah.

54:55.095 --> 54:56.756
The black plague!
Is it the black plague?

54:56.963 --> 54:58.487
No, that there was all my fault.

54:58.798 --> 55:00.993
Tell you what, can't tell you
how sorry I is

55:01.201 --> 55:03.795
for running into your sister there
like that.

55:04.003 --> 55:05.027
Aunt Josephine, this--

55:05.238 --> 55:07.103
Couple of right beauties
you are, mum.

55:07.340 --> 55:08.500
Especially you.

55:08.708 --> 55:10.232
Aunt Josephine--

55:10.510 --> 55:12.000
But allow me to introduce meself.

55:12.245 --> 55:14.145
No, allow Klaus and I to introduce him.

55:14.414 --> 55:16.405
- This--
- ''Klaus and me.''

55:16.616 --> 55:17.913
It doesn't matter. This is--

55:18.118 --> 55:19.312
Doesn't matter?

55:20.954 --> 55:22.421
Are you jigging me, girl?

55:22.722 --> 55:27.159
Why, perhaps it's just the ramblings
of an expert fisherman,

55:27.427 --> 55:29.327
but grammar is the number-one
most important thing

55:29.529 --> 55:31.520
in this here world to me.

55:31.931 --> 55:32.920
It is?

55:34.367 --> 55:37.234
It's the whole ball of wax.
The entire kit and caboodle.

55:37.470 --> 55:39.131
Why, without your good grammar,

55:39.339 --> 55:42.740
the whole darn shooting match
could go arse over tea kettle.

55:43.343 --> 55:46.779
Well, you can certainly turn a phrase.

55:47.147 --> 55:49.877
I can flip it up and rub it down too.

55:50.150 --> 55:54.951
Of course, that would be entirely
up to you, mum.

55:56.189 --> 55:57.816
Captain Sham. . .

55:58.691 --> 56:00.090
. . .at your service.

56:00.393 --> 56:03.294
He's lying. He's Count Olaf.

56:04.297 --> 56:07.630
That horrible man you warned me
about? Where? Who?

56:07.834 --> 56:09.495
- Right in front of you.
- Where's he at?

56:09.702 --> 56:11.101
- Behind Captain Sham?
- No.

56:11.304 --> 56:15.138
I'll show him a thing or two. I'll give
him the old ''wax on, wax off,'' me son.

56:15.408 --> 56:17.103
Captain Sham is Count Olaf.

56:18.111 --> 56:20.306
I'm not going through this again.

56:20.513 --> 56:22.504
Children of the corn!

56:24.150 --> 56:25.447
Klaus!

56:25.652 --> 56:29.816
Why did you do this
to this poor man?

56:30.023 --> 56:32.856
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

56:33.826 --> 56:36.317
That's gonna smart in the morning.

56:36.829 --> 56:39.423
Oh, I don't pay that no
never mind, mum.

56:39.732 --> 56:43.327
He's just a boy barely
out of his OshKosh B'Gosh.

56:43.536 --> 56:45.128
I've had to deal with that sort of thing

56:45.338 --> 56:48.330
ever since me leg was chewed off
by the Lachrymose leeches.

56:48.841 --> 56:54.143
Why didn't I wait an hour before
swimming? Why? Why? Why?

56:55.248 --> 56:57.011
The leeches took my husband too.

56:57.183 --> 56:58.207
Get out of town.

56:58.418 --> 57:00.613
No, really.

57:00.820 --> 57:05.120
By jeez, them blasted leeches doomed
me to a life of hopping, they did.

57:05.892 --> 57:08.383
Sure, I get the good parking spots,

57:08.695 --> 57:12.631
but who could love a man with one leg
and a face like a hen's arse?

57:12.899 --> 57:16.198
I'm as lonely as a gull on a rock, girl.

57:16.502 --> 57:19.096
Oh, Captain Sham.

57:19.839 --> 57:23.434
Would you come to my house
for dinner this evening?

57:23.710 --> 57:24.699
- No!
- No!

57:25.011 --> 57:26.638
Oh, no, I don't know about that, mum.

57:26.846 --> 57:30.407
I'm afeard I might scuff up the floors
with this old cribbage peg.

57:30.617 --> 57:33.051
Well, I will lay down newspapers.

57:33.353 --> 57:37.312
Please, the children are going to make
a lovely dinner of puttanesca.

57:37.624 --> 57:41.560
The very meal I ate
before they took me leg!

57:42.028 --> 57:46.124
Oh, my goodness. Well, children,
I'm going to take Captain Sham home.

57:46.432 --> 57:50.766
And you stay here and shop for
an entirely puttanesca-free dinner.

57:51.838 --> 57:54.773
- But--
- ''But'' is not a sentence, Klaus.

57:56.643 --> 57:57.769
Aunt Josephine.

57:57.977 --> 58:00.605
Hey, you haven't paid for that.

58:07.186 --> 58:09.381
Kids today.

58:32.812 --> 58:34.507
Aunt Josephine?

58:40.320 --> 58:42.015
Aunt Josephine?

58:44.924 --> 58:46.323
Are you here?

58:46.826 --> 58:48.157
Aunt Jo?

58:49.262 --> 58:50.661
Are you here?

58:51.431 --> 58:53.126
Aunt Josephine?

58:58.905 --> 59:00.372
Oh, no.

59:00.573 --> 59:02.268
No.

59:08.381 --> 59:09.780
We're too late.

59:12.385 --> 59:14.182
We're too late.

59:20.426 --> 59:21.825
What does it say?

59:22.195 --> 59:23.890
It's a suicide note.

59:26.032 --> 59:29.991
''Violet, Klaus and Sunny, by the time
you read this, my life will be at its end.

59:30.203 --> 59:33.695
My heart is as cold as lke,
and I find life inbearable.''

59:34.006 --> 59:35.200
''lnbearable''?

59:35.408 --> 59:36.705
Go on.

59:37.210 --> 59:40.543
''l know you children may not
understand the sad life of a dowadg--''

59:41.013 --> 59:42.344
''Dowager'' has one D.

59:42.548 --> 59:44.345
It doesn't matter. Keep going.

59:45.618 --> 59:50.851
''--or what would have led to this
desperate akt.'' ''Act'' is spelled with a C.

59:51.124 --> 59:53.024
It's a suicide note.
Why are you checking spelling?

59:53.226 --> 59:55.126
She said her greatest joy in life
was grammar.

59:55.328 --> 59:56.659
Why is she making
all these mistakes?

59:58.030 --> 59:59.520
If you were about to jump
out a window,

59:59.732 --> 01:00:01.723
you might make
a few spelling mistakes too.

01:00:02.068 --> 01:00:03.763
''Please know that
I am much happier this way.

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:06.871
As my last will and testament, I leave
you three in the care of Captain Sham,

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.233
a kind and honorable man.''

01:00:10.943 --> 01:00:13.468
That was his plan.
He made her write this note,

01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:15.442
and then he pushed her
out the window.

01:00:21.387 --> 01:00:24.845
No. It's not a suicide note.
It's a message.

01:00:25.291 --> 01:00:28.260
It's not supposed to be ''lke,''
it's supposed to be ''ice.'' C.

01:00:29.962 --> 01:00:31.759
And ''unbearable'' with a U.

01:00:50.383 --> 01:00:52.908
All the way over to Curdled Cave,
way over there.

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:55.587
She's not dead. She's hiding.

01:00:56.122 --> 01:00:57.419
Curdled Cave?

01:01:01.427 --> 01:01:02.724
Sunny!

01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:25.847
He was investigating fires.

01:01:37.396 --> 01:01:39.557
Klaus, we gotta go.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.606
Come away from the fridge.

01:01:56.082 --> 01:01:57.106
What?

01:01:57.617 --> 01:02:00.108
If it falls, it could crush you flat.

01:02:41.394 --> 01:02:42.361
No way.

01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:54.873
Is it over?

01:03:01.614 --> 01:03:04.549
Violet, you better tie your hair up.

01:03:25.037 --> 01:03:27.665
Violet, ideas?

01:03:47.159 --> 01:03:48.649
Bring me that fire extinguisher.

01:03:49.362 --> 01:03:50.294
Why?

01:03:50.663 --> 01:03:52.995
Because we need to move
this anchor over there.

01:03:53.265 --> 01:03:55.893
- What?
- Just help me.

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:12.411
On three, we're gonna
break that beam.

01:04:12.618 --> 01:04:13.915
- Break it?
- Yes.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.714
- That's the only thing keeping us up.
- Exactly.

01:04:16.956 --> 01:04:18.617
Are you sure you tied your hair
tight enough?

01:04:18.924 --> 01:04:20.323
On three.

01:04:21.827 --> 01:04:23.055
One.

01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:25.057
Two.

01:04:26.032 --> 01:04:27.056
Three.

01:04:37.143 --> 01:04:38.167
Wait.

01:04:38.477 --> 01:04:39.671
Wait.

01:04:40.146 --> 01:04:42.273
Wait. Hold on, Sunny.

01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:43.641
Now!

01:04:59.298 --> 01:05:00.629
What do we do now?

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:03.393
She's alive. We have to go
to the authorities.

01:05:03.803 --> 01:05:05.134
- No.
- What?

01:05:05.438 --> 01:05:07.736
- They won't listen. They never listen.
- Violet!

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:11.398
It's Olaf. He'll never stop.
We have to find her ourselves.

01:05:13.646 --> 01:05:15.136
Hey, you kids.

01:05:15.448 --> 01:05:18.815
It's Captain Sham,
your new guardian.

01:05:19.118 --> 01:05:22.815
You just stay where you're at,
and we'll come where you're to.

01:05:23.155 --> 01:05:25.248
Ever read any books on sailing?

01:05:28.027 --> 01:05:33.329
Klaus had read exactly 15 books on
sailing and two books on meteorology.

01:05:33.866 --> 01:05:36.630
But it is one thing to do something
in theory,

01:05:36.836 --> 01:05:39.066
another to do it in practice.

01:05:39.338 --> 01:05:42.865
Little could have prepared them
for the crossing to Curdled Cave

01:05:43.075 --> 01:05:46.977
at the hands of an angry
and ill-humored lake.

01:05:47.179 --> 01:05:50.637
But as the storm passed
and the waters calmed,

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:54.843
the Baudelaires couldn't help but feel
a small sense of accomplishment.

01:05:55.087 --> 01:05:58.682
A rare moment of joy
in their otherwise woeful lives.

01:06:00.092 --> 01:06:01.582
They had made it.

01:06:01.794 --> 01:06:04.194
And if their guardian
could not rescue them,

01:06:04.396 --> 01:06:07.991
then they would rescue
their guardian.

01:06:18.611 --> 01:06:20.203
Aunt Josephine?

01:06:35.728 --> 01:06:37.218
Aunt Josephine?

01:06:53.579 --> 01:06:55.240
Aunt Josephine?

01:06:58.284 --> 01:06:59.808
Are you in here?

01:07:11.597 --> 01:07:13.030
Aunt Josephine!

01:07:15.935 --> 01:07:17.402
Oh, children.

01:07:17.603 --> 01:07:22.506
You did it! You deciphered
the clues in my note.

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:24.107
We're so glad you're okay.

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:25.402
It was so horrible.

01:07:25.611 --> 01:07:28.045
Count Olaf forced me
to write that will,

01:07:28.247 --> 01:07:31.512
and then it nearly killed me to add in
all those grammatical errors.

01:07:33.452 --> 01:07:35.147
So did you bring groceries?

01:07:35.354 --> 01:07:38.255
Groceries?
We just came through a storm.

01:07:38.457 --> 01:07:41.358
Well, so? How do you expect us
to live in this cave

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.425
if you didn't bring any food?

01:07:43.629 --> 01:07:44.823
Live in the cave?

01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:47.157
No, no, no. Aunt Josephine,
you have to come back with us.

01:07:47.366 --> 01:07:50.335
You willed us to Captain Sham.
You're the only proof we have it's a lie.

01:07:50.536 --> 01:07:53.266
No, no, no, no. No, no, it's much too
dangerous, children. I'm very sorry.

01:07:53.472 --> 01:07:56.771
Too dangerous? You're our guardian.
You're supposed to take care of us.

01:07:56.976 --> 01:07:58.705
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

01:08:00.512 --> 01:08:04.073
You know, Aunt Josephine,
Curdled Cave is for sale.

01:08:04.283 --> 01:08:05.375
So?

01:08:05.885 --> 01:08:10.788
So before too long, people
are gonna come to look at it.

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:14.785
And some of those people
will be realtors.

01:08:40.019 --> 01:08:41.542
Aunt Josephine,

01:08:42.621 --> 01:08:44.212
what does this mean?

01:08:45.224 --> 01:08:46.622
Where did you find that?

01:08:46.825 --> 01:08:48.314
I found it in lke's room.

01:08:48.761 --> 01:08:50.319
The fires.

01:08:50.729 --> 01:08:52.662
Why was he investigating fires?

01:08:52.898 --> 01:08:57.801
We all were. Uncle Monty, lke and. . .

01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:00.670
Our parents.

01:09:01.774 --> 01:09:04.072
They were our leaders.

01:09:05.277 --> 01:09:06.470
Children,

01:09:07.179 --> 01:09:11.707
there are good people
and bad people in the world.

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:15.613
The ones who start the fires
and the ones who put them out.

01:09:15.854 --> 01:09:17.014
Who's doing this?

01:09:17.288 --> 01:09:18.278
Is it Olaf?

01:09:19.191 --> 01:09:21.853
I've said too much already.
Your parents knew the answer to that,

01:09:22.094 --> 01:09:23.322
and look what happened to them.

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:27.487
Our parents? What did they say?

01:09:29.033 --> 01:09:31.024
We should never have left that cave.

01:09:31.236 --> 01:09:32.828
It's not too late for us
to turn around now,

01:09:33.037 --> 01:09:34.835
and I'll just take my chances
with the realtors.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.029
Aunt Josephine,

01:09:36.375 --> 01:09:38.935
what did our parents say?

01:09:40.212 --> 01:09:41.839
We're going to die.

01:09:43.415 --> 01:09:46.850
- What?
- It's the leeches!

01:09:53.524 --> 01:09:56.824
I guess it's a good thing none of us
have eaten in a while then.

01:10:06.438 --> 01:10:07.837
Aunt Josephine!

01:10:25.657 --> 01:10:27.955
There's a crack in the boat!

01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:33.861
Klaus, what do we do?
They're eating the boat!

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.661
We're sinking, sinking, sinking.

01:10:36.869 --> 01:10:39.963
- Klaus, paddle, please.
- Doomed. Doomed.

01:10:40.172 --> 01:10:42.800
Aunt Josephine, that is not helping.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:52.172
There's a boat.
Over here! Over here!

01:10:52.384 --> 01:10:55.581
But as unpleasant
as Lachrymose leeches can be,

01:10:55.821 --> 01:10:59.917
there was something far more
unpleasant arriving out of the fog.

01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:04.061
Hello, hello, hello.

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:08.461
I missed you guys.

01:11:08.667 --> 01:11:12.535
Looks like you could use
a little assistance.

01:11:12.738 --> 01:11:15.036
You're gonna need assistance
when we get back to town.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.401
Aunt Josephine's gonna tell everyone
what happened.

01:11:17.643 --> 01:11:19.133
Then I'll be arrested and sent to jail,

01:11:19.344 --> 01:11:21.574
and you'll live happily ever after
with a friendly guardian,

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.839
spending your time inventing things
and reading books

01:11:24.049 --> 01:11:25.482
and sharpening
your little monkey teeth.

01:11:25.684 --> 01:11:27.743
And bravery and nobility
will prevail at last.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.979
And this wicked world
will slowly but surely become

01:11:30.255 --> 01:11:31.347
a place of cheerful harmony.

01:11:31.557 --> 01:11:33.548
And everyone will be singing
and dancing and giggling

01:11:33.792 --> 01:11:35.089
Iike the Littlest Elf.

01:11:35.294 --> 01:11:38.752
A happy ending.
Is that what you had in mind?

01:11:39.164 --> 01:11:43.191
Because I hardly think that anybody
is going to believe a dead woman.

01:11:43.569 --> 01:11:44.900
You're not gonna touch
Aunt Josephine.

01:11:45.104 --> 01:11:46.401
She'll tell everyone what happened.

01:11:46.605 --> 01:11:49.073
No, no, no, no, I won't tell anybody
anything. I promise.

01:11:49.274 --> 01:11:50.935
Please don't throw me
to the leeches.

01:11:51.176 --> 01:11:53.576
You can have the fortune.
You can have the children.

01:11:53.779 --> 01:11:55.269
Aunt Josephine!

01:11:55.481 --> 01:11:56.607
Please.

01:11:56.815 --> 01:11:59.545
Welcome aboard. Hot potato.

01:12:01.453 --> 01:12:04.422
I'll go away. I'll dye my hair.
I'll change my name.

01:12:04.656 --> 01:12:08.148
- But what about us?
- Quiet, child. The adults are talking.

01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:13.564
- I suppose I don't have to kill you.
- No.

01:12:13.765 --> 01:12:16.233
On the other hand, with that little stunt
of yours at the window,

01:12:16.401 --> 01:12:19.768
you hadn't been
a very trustworthy person.

01:12:20.472 --> 01:12:21.769
But. . .

01:12:23.575 --> 01:12:25.634
. . .I could show a little mercy.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.914
''Haven't.''

01:12:33.952 --> 01:12:35.078
What?

01:12:35.954 --> 01:12:39.549
You said ''hadn't.'' That's bad grammar.
You should've said,

01:12:39.791 --> 01:12:42.589
''You haven't been
a very trustworthy person.''

01:12:46.298 --> 01:12:49.756
Thank you for correcting me.

01:12:50.369 --> 01:12:51.597
Not at all.

01:12:52.871 --> 01:12:55.601
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Aunt Josephine. Aunt Josephine!

01:12:55.807 --> 01:12:57.001
- Aunt Josephine.
- You can't--

01:12:57.142 --> 01:12:59.303
- Aunt Josephine. Aunt--
- Aunt Josephine. Jump!

01:13:00.445 --> 01:13:02.606
Well, you get the picture.

01:13:06.952 --> 01:13:08.544
Aunt Josephine.

01:13:09.254 --> 01:13:13.520
Well, we've done all we can do.

01:13:15.961 --> 01:13:17.326
Everybody be cool.

01:13:17.729 --> 01:13:20.129
Children? Is that you?

01:13:20.332 --> 01:13:21.629
Mr. Poe! We're--

01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:23.130
Drowning.

01:13:25.971 --> 01:13:29.372
I saved him! I saved the boy
from the leeches!

01:13:29.575 --> 01:13:32.135
Back to the depths,
you fingery devils.

01:13:32.344 --> 01:13:35.370
You will not devour
this boy's head today.

01:13:39.885 --> 01:13:42.547
Count Olaf?
What are you doing here?

01:13:42.788 --> 01:13:47.282
Mr. Poe, please. Count Olaf,
what are you doing here, man?

01:13:47.659 --> 01:13:50.150
I know, I know. I shouldn't have come.

01:13:50.395 --> 01:13:53.853
But when I heard the children
were in danger, I had to.

01:13:54.266 --> 01:13:56.359
Even if I'm not. . .

01:13:56.702 --> 01:13:58.636
. . .fit to be their guardian.

01:14:00.606 --> 01:14:02.801
It appears I was wrong about you,
Count Olaf.

01:14:03.008 --> 01:14:05.033
- No!
- No.

01:14:05.244 --> 01:14:08.805
You have proven yourself to be
an exceptionally capable guardian.

01:14:09.214 --> 01:14:10.806
And I would be remiss
in my responsibility

01:14:11.016 --> 01:14:13.712
if I did not place the children
with you immediately.

01:14:14.419 --> 01:14:16.614
- Why, if it weren't for you, the--
- Don't say it!

01:14:16.855 --> 01:14:20.018
I can't stand the thought
of losing my little treasures.

01:14:20.225 --> 01:14:22.420
Even the thought
of the massive inheritance

01:14:22.628 --> 01:14:25.529
would be a constant reminder
of my heartache.

01:14:25.731 --> 01:14:27.722
Well, well, there's no need
to fret about that.

01:14:27.933 --> 01:14:31.369
The law clearly states that you
would not inherit the Baudelaire fortune

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.037
if anything happened to the children.

01:14:33.372 --> 01:14:34.339
Say what?

01:14:34.539 --> 01:14:39.135
No, no. With the exception, of course,
of blood relatives and married couples.

01:14:39.845 --> 01:14:40.937
Really?

01:14:50.289 --> 01:14:51.756
Mr. Poe,

01:14:52.357 --> 01:14:55.952
have I told you about our new play?

01:15:06.705 --> 01:15:08.195
Critic.

01:15:08.907 --> 01:15:10.340
Critic!

01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:12.999
Cape, sir.

01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:15.008
Don't try to get on my good side.

01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:20.850
What is he up to?
Why are we in the play?

01:15:21.053 --> 01:15:24.955
He's using this as a prop.
It says that if two people are married,

01:15:25.157 --> 01:15:28.217
they're entitled to any money
that either of them has.

01:15:28.427 --> 01:15:31.828
No, but it's just a play. He can't get
our fortune by marrying me in a play.

01:15:33.265 --> 01:15:34.630
Can't l?

01:15:34.833 --> 01:15:38.929
Conspirators. ''Caesar must die.
Caesar must die. Caesar must die.''

01:15:39.137 --> 01:15:40.365
In order to be a valid marriage,

01:15:40.572 --> 01:15:43.336
it has to be administered
by a bona fide justice of the peace.

01:15:43.542 --> 01:15:44.668
It says so right here.

01:15:44.876 --> 01:15:49.142
Justice Strauss, are you ready
for your debut?

01:15:50.949 --> 01:15:55.682
Look at you.
Violet, you look so beautiful.

01:15:56.088 --> 01:15:59.216
You are the bride, I'm the judge.
Who's the groom?

01:15:59.491 --> 01:16:02.085
No, Justice Strauss, you don't
understand. The play is real.

01:16:02.294 --> 01:16:04.228
Yes! Yes.

01:16:04.429 --> 01:16:07.990
It must be real. That's why I cast you.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.101
All the other actors I saw
lacked the proper--

01:16:11.303 --> 01:16:12.702
What's the word I'm looking for?

01:16:12.904 --> 01:16:14.701
- Hair?
- Hands?

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.840
Verisimilitude.

01:16:17.542 --> 01:16:18.839
Now, remember, Justice Strauss,

01:16:19.044 --> 01:16:21.808
you must say the words exactly
as you would in a real wedding.

01:16:22.013 --> 01:16:24.811
Get it absolutely right. There are
talent scouts in the audience

01:16:25.016 --> 01:16:28.349
Iooking for someone your age.
It's all riding on this one.

01:16:29.121 --> 01:16:32.215
Why did you have to tell me that?
Oh, my God.

01:16:32.424 --> 01:16:33.618
Take her to makeup.

01:16:33.859 --> 01:16:37.056
Enjoy! Embrace the butterflies.

01:16:37.262 --> 01:16:41.323
This is ridiculous. Violet's only 14.
She can't be legally married.

01:16:41.533 --> 01:16:43.364
She can if she has the permission
of her guardian.

01:16:43.568 --> 01:16:46.435
And who's that? Oh, yes. Me!

01:16:49.141 --> 01:16:50.665
Look it up, bookworm.

01:16:50.876 --> 01:16:53.640
Yes. Once you say ''l do''
and sign the marriage certificate,

01:16:53.845 --> 01:16:56.336
you'll really be my loverly bride.

01:16:56.548 --> 01:16:59.676
You'll cook and clean
and massage my bunions

01:16:59.885 --> 01:17:02.376
and clip my thick, yellow toenails.

01:17:02.587 --> 01:17:07.024
Hey, marriage is no picnic.
You gotta work at it.

01:17:07.292 --> 01:17:09.624
I'll never say ''l do.'' Never.

01:17:11.096 --> 01:17:12.791
I think you might. . .

01:17:13.732 --> 01:17:16.030
. . .once you look up there.

01:17:24.543 --> 01:17:25.635
Let her go!

01:17:26.211 --> 01:17:27.803
Gladly. Let her go.

01:17:28.713 --> 01:17:30.510
- No!
- Put a hold on that.

01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:33.918
If you don't say ''l do,''

01:17:34.119 --> 01:17:37.145
or if anything should happen
to interrupt this performance,

01:17:38.023 --> 01:17:39.513
I say one word into this,

01:17:39.758 --> 01:17:44.127
and down will come baby,
cradle and all.

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:46.024
Clang!

01:17:47.032 --> 01:17:49.227
How could you? She's an infant.

01:17:49.434 --> 01:17:52.665
Oh, Violet. Violet, Violet, Violet.

01:17:53.572 --> 01:17:56.040
Violet.

01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:57.868
You're 1 4 years old.

01:17:58.076 --> 01:18:01.807
You should know by now that you
can't have everything you want.

01:18:02.113 --> 01:18:05.674
You want a life of happiness?
A roof over your head?

01:18:05.884 --> 01:18:08.876
A place to call your own
and all that jazz?

01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:13.883
And what about what I want?

01:18:14.626 --> 01:18:17.686
I want that enormous fortune

01:18:17.896 --> 01:18:21.889
and for all investigations
against me to cease.

01:18:22.734 --> 01:18:27.034
You're going to help me
get what I want. . .

01:18:27.939 --> 01:18:29.429
. . .tonight.

01:18:38.617 --> 01:18:40.448
My public awaits.

01:18:48.527 --> 01:18:51.462
Ladies and gentlemen, could you
put your appendages together

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:54.324
for The Marvelouse Marriage.

01:18:54.533 --> 01:18:56.933
No. You're not gonna
go through with this.

01:19:00.272 --> 01:19:01.705
I have to.

01:19:02.107 --> 01:19:05.270
No, come on.
There's always something.

01:19:05.477 --> 01:19:07.206
There's always something.

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:10.475
No, not this time.

01:19:11.983 --> 01:19:12.972
But. . .

01:19:13.184 --> 01:19:14.811
Camel, you're on.

01:19:17.289 --> 01:19:19.280
- Go, Klaus.
- Violet.

01:19:19.491 --> 01:19:20.480
Go!

01:19:21.693 --> 01:19:23.820
Move your hump, camel. You're on.

01:19:32.504 --> 01:19:34.995
Nothing in the world will keep
The count from his beloved bride

01:19:35.206 --> 01:19:37.800
Nothing in the world will keep
The count from his beloved bride

01:19:38.009 --> 01:19:40.034
Nothing in the world
Nothing in the world

01:19:40.245 --> 01:19:42.509
Nothing
Nothing

01:19:47.218 --> 01:19:51.154
What a marvelous day
for a marriage.

01:19:51.356 --> 01:19:56.658
If only the handsome count
were here to claim his bride.

01:19:56.861 --> 01:20:00.820
With his full head of hair
and great bravery,

01:20:01.032 --> 01:20:04.024
the count has no equal.

01:20:06.137 --> 01:20:07.536
What would Violet do?

01:20:07.739 --> 01:20:11.436
The courageous battle
has waylaid him.

01:20:11.643 --> 01:20:15.374
There's always something.
There's always something.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.344
And a quiet, bald-headed suitor

01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:21.178
has stolen the bride's affections.

01:20:22.153 --> 01:20:25.247
Alas. The groom is a cad.

01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:28.891
And nowhere near as handsome
as the count.

01:20:29.194 --> 01:20:32.095
If only for a miracle.

01:20:32.297 --> 01:20:36.597
Some way for the handsome count
to come and save. . .

01:20:40.872 --> 01:20:44.273
What a thoroughly unmarvelous
marriage this will be.

01:20:44.476 --> 01:20:45.966
But wait.

01:20:46.611 --> 01:20:49.273
What is that?

01:20:54.085 --> 01:20:58.419
It's the count, in his autogiro.

01:20:58.623 --> 01:21:00.716
I didn't know they had
this kind of budget.

01:21:11.536 --> 01:21:16.667
Yes, it is l, come to marry my bride.

01:21:17.175 --> 01:21:21.942
And you, sir, have been taken
by surprise.

01:21:22.447 --> 01:21:25.746
Caution. This next scene could get
pretty graphic.

01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:27.349
Away, rapscallion!

01:21:31.356 --> 01:21:32.584
Hairless Lothario!

01:21:33.158 --> 01:21:35.456
Take that. And that.

01:21:37.162 --> 01:21:38.857
Can I get some slack?

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:43.293
Let the wedding begin.

01:22:10.829 --> 01:22:12.126
Don't look down.

01:22:13.331 --> 01:22:14.730
Don't look down.

01:22:27.779 --> 01:22:30.577
Do you, Count Olaf,

01:22:30.782 --> 01:22:34.980
take this to be
your lawfully wedded wife,

01:22:35.186 --> 01:22:39.350
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:41.356
Until death,

01:22:42.494 --> 01:22:44.587
I most certainly do.

01:22:48.066 --> 01:22:50.193
Do you, Violet Baudelaire,

01:22:50.401 --> 01:22:54.098
take this--? Count Olaf

01:22:54.305 --> 01:22:57.399
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

01:22:57.609 --> 01:23:01.636
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

01:23:01.846 --> 01:23:03.507
Justice Strauss, l--

01:23:09.854 --> 01:23:11.048
I do.

01:23:11.723 --> 01:23:13.623
- She doesn't deserve him.
- No.

01:23:13.825 --> 01:23:16.521
- Are you thinking that?
- No, she doesn't.

01:23:16.961 --> 01:23:18.861
- Now, all that is left. . .
- Sunny?

01:23:19.063 --> 01:23:22.328
. . .is for this happy couple to sign
the marriage certificate,

01:23:22.534 --> 01:23:24.229
and this union shall be--

01:23:24.435 --> 01:23:25.868
Official

01:23:26.571 --> 01:23:27.731
and legal.

01:23:51.863 --> 01:23:55.094
Sunny, where's the key?
The key to the lock.

01:24:20.458 --> 01:24:22.756
Right hand, please.

01:25:27.058 --> 01:25:29.526
Children, I'm afraid
I must inform you

01:25:29.727 --> 01:25:33.356
of an extremely unfortunate event.

01:25:34.632 --> 01:25:37.624
I'm very, very sorry to tell you this,
but your parents have perished in a fire

01:25:37.835 --> 01:25:39.666
that's destroyed your entire home.

01:25:40.638 --> 01:25:42.731
These things don't just happen.

01:25:46.477 --> 01:25:48.069
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:54.941
Look what I did
to your pretty little home.

01:25:56.654 --> 01:25:57.712
Let's finish here.

01:26:06.698 --> 01:26:07.722
Boss.

01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:10.125
What is it? Kind of busy right now.

01:26:10.335 --> 01:26:11.495
We've got a problem.

01:26:11.703 --> 01:26:12.829
Where are you?

01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:14.834
Look up.

01:26:19.143 --> 01:26:20.110
Hi!

01:26:24.015 --> 01:26:25.642
And so concludes our play!

01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:27.511
No, wait, it wasn't a play!

01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:30.449
Count Olaf was gonna kill Sunny
if I didn't go through with the marriage.

01:26:30.722 --> 01:26:31.654
Ridiculous.

01:26:32.623 --> 01:26:34.022
No, you have to listen to me.

01:26:34.225 --> 01:26:37.217
He was only marrying me to get
to the Baudelaire fortune.

01:26:37.428 --> 01:26:39.020
No, that part is true, actually.

01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:40.219
What?

01:26:40.431 --> 01:26:43.832
Violet and I are indeed
a blissfully wedded couple,

01:26:44.035 --> 01:26:45.229
because, you see,

01:26:46.337 --> 01:26:48.828
we were married
in an official ceremony,

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.974
with official and legal vows

01:26:51.175 --> 01:26:55.373
in front of a bona fide
justice of the peace.

01:26:55.747 --> 01:26:57.476
Oh, my God, what have I done?

01:26:57.882 --> 01:26:59.782
I'm sorry! I didn't know!

01:26:59.984 --> 01:27:01.679
First order of business,

01:27:01.886 --> 01:27:05.287
put the other two brats
up for adoption, separately,

01:27:05.490 --> 01:27:07.617
into the far corners of the earth.

01:27:07.892 --> 01:27:11.191
These children are meddlesome
when they're together.

01:27:11.396 --> 01:27:17.198
- Mr. Poe!
- You unspeakable cad! Arrest him!

01:27:18.202 --> 01:27:19.294
For what?

01:27:19.604 --> 01:27:21.003
For being a greedy monster!

01:27:21.205 --> 01:27:22.194
Come on.

01:27:23.508 --> 01:27:27.308
Oh, I'm the monster? I'm the monster?

01:27:28.346 --> 01:27:30.712
You're the monster.

01:27:31.115 --> 01:27:33.413
Come on. Come on.

01:27:33.618 --> 01:27:37.247
These children tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

01:27:37.522 --> 01:27:40.218
No one ever listens to children.

01:27:40.925 --> 01:27:43.257
- Come on.
- Do you think you're innocent?

01:27:43.461 --> 01:27:45.019
You're accomplices.

01:27:45.563 --> 01:27:49.363
This certificate says
that I have the fortune now.

01:27:49.767 --> 01:27:50.859
Come on!

01:27:51.069 --> 01:27:53.629
And there's nothing you can do
about it!

01:27:59.377 --> 01:28:02.710
What do you think? Too diabolical?
Give me some feedback.

01:28:18.196 --> 01:28:21.029
Hey, marriage is no picnic.

01:28:21.232 --> 01:28:24.497
Oh, and by the way,
you're a terrible actor.

01:28:25.002 --> 01:28:26.128
Now, now,

01:28:27.205 --> 01:28:29.002
Iet's keep our heads here.

01:28:29.307 --> 01:28:32.936
If you do anything to me,
you're just sinking to my level.

01:28:33.211 --> 01:28:37.204
Not to mention setting
a terrible example for the children.

01:28:38.449 --> 01:28:39.507
Guilty.

01:28:39.717 --> 01:28:43.244
I am thrilled to say that Count Olaf
was captured,

01:28:43.454 --> 01:28:46.150
for crimes too numerous to mention.

01:28:46.424 --> 01:28:49.916
And before serving his life sentence,
it was the judge's decree

01:28:50.161 --> 01:28:52.652
that Olaf be made to suffer
every hardship

01:28:52.930 --> 01:28:54.830
- that he forced upon the children.
- Yes!

01:28:57.802 --> 01:29:00.100
Get out! Get out!

01:29:04.375 --> 01:29:05.808
Oh, no.

01:29:14.986 --> 01:29:17.420
The Baudelaires had triumphed.

01:29:17.688 --> 01:29:21.818
A word which here means, ''unmasking
a cruel and talentless arsonist

01:29:22.093 --> 01:29:25.028
and solving the mystery
of the Baudelaire fire. ''

01:29:27.899 --> 01:29:30.129
If only justice were as kind.

01:29:30.334 --> 01:29:35.636
Count Olaf vanished after a jury
of his peers overturned his sentence.

01:29:36.207 --> 01:29:39.904
As for the Baudelaires, what lay
ahead for them was unclear.

01:29:40.111 --> 01:29:41.601
But one thing they knew,
as they climbed

01:29:41.812 --> 01:29:44.838
once again into the back
of Mr. Poe's car:

01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:47.017
They were moving on.

01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:51.417
Now, don't worry, children,

01:29:51.923 --> 01:29:55.017
I'm sure the authorities will catch up
with Count Olaf very soon.

01:29:56.227 --> 01:29:59.924
No, no, we'll never have to deal
with that terrible man again.

01:30:03.734 --> 01:30:05.224
Before we leave,

01:30:06.671 --> 01:30:10.732
perhaps there's time
for just one last stop.

01:31:56.781 --> 01:31:59.807
''Violet, Klaus and Sunny.''
It's addressed to us.

01:32:00.017 --> 01:32:01.814
Look at all these postmarks.

01:32:02.153 --> 01:32:07.113
It's been to England and Rome
and Kenya and lceland.

01:32:07.425 --> 01:32:09.222
I don't even know
where these are from.

01:32:09.427 --> 01:32:10.724
Who's it from?

01:32:17.335 --> 01:32:18.734
Mom and Dad.

01:32:33.851 --> 01:32:35.250
It's the letter.

01:32:36.187 --> 01:32:38.052
The letter that never came.

01:32:42.059 --> 01:32:44.687
''Dearest children,
since we've been abroad

01:32:44.895 --> 01:32:46.658
we have missed you all so much.

01:32:47.898 --> 01:32:51.197
Certain events have compelled us
to extend our travels.

01:32:52.002 --> 01:32:53.663
One day, when you're older,

01:32:54.171 --> 01:32:56.605
you will learn all about the people
we've befriended

01:32:56.807 --> 01:32:58.536
and the dangers we have faced.

01:32:59.243 --> 01:33:02.406
At times, the world can seem
an unfriendly and sinister place.

01:33:02.613 --> 01:33:06.310
But believe us when we say that there
is much more good in it than bad.

01:33:06.517 --> 01:33:08.712
All you have to do
is look hard enough.

01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:12.048
And what might seem to be
a series of unfortunate events

01:33:12.323 --> 01:33:14.917
may in fact be the first steps
of a journey.

01:33:15.926 --> 01:33:18.724
We hope to have you back
in our arms soon, darlings.

01:33:18.929 --> 01:33:23.025
But in case this letter arrives before
our return, know that we love you.

01:33:24.335 --> 01:33:27.236
It fills us with pride to know that
no matter what happens in this life

01:33:27.438 --> 01:33:28.962
that you three will take care
of each other

01:33:29.173 --> 01:33:31.471
with kindness and bravery
and selflessness,

01:33:31.675 --> 01:33:33.438
as you always have.

01:33:33.978 --> 01:33:37.141
And remember one thing, my darlings,
and never forget it:

01:33:37.848 --> 01:33:41.648
That no matter where we are, know
that as long as you have each other,

01:33:41.852 --> 01:33:44.480
you have your family,
and you are home.

01:33:45.456 --> 01:33:47.151
Your loving parents.''

01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:09.937
Passing the torch is a rite of passage
that can take many forms.

01:34:10.147 --> 01:34:13.913
But perhaps the least known
and most surprising

01:34:14.418 --> 01:34:16.613
is the passing of a spyglass.

01:34:35.339 --> 01:34:37.864
Dear reader, there are people
in the world

01:34:38.075 --> 01:34:40.839
who know no misery and woe.
And they take comfort

01:34:41.045 --> 01:34:43.275
in cheerful films about twittering
birds and giggling elves.

01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:49.183
There are people who know that
there's always a mystery to be solved.

01:34:49.386 --> 01:34:50.853
And they take comfort in researching

01:34:51.055 --> 01:34:54.354
and writing down
any important evidence.

01:34:56.393 --> 01:34:59.294
But this story is not about
such people.

01:34:59.597 --> 01:35:02.691
This story is about the Baudelaires.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.232
And they are the sort of people who
know that there's always something.

01:35:08.105 --> 01:35:11.302
Something to invent,
something to read,

01:35:11.509 --> 01:35:14.137
something to bite
and something to do

01:35:14.345 --> 01:35:17.712
to make a sanctuary,
no matter how small.

01:35:28.526 --> 01:35:31.723
And for this reason,
I am happy to say,

01:35:31.929 --> 01:35:36.866
the Baudelaires were
very fortunate indeed.

01:46:11.902 --> 01:46:15.394
Oh, the captain loved
The ladies

01:46:15.605 --> 01:46:18.005
But he dragged himself
A wife

01:46:18.208 --> 01:46:21.803
Now he's wishin' he was fishin'
But he's on the hook for life

01:46:22.012 --> 01:46:23.309
Well, I guess he should not
Ought-er

01:46:23.513 --> 01:46:25.708
But he drowned her
In the water

01:46:25.916 --> 01:46:27.611
And then a flounder
Downed her

01:46:27.817 --> 01:46:29.910
That's why they never
Found her

01:46:35.225 --> 01:46:38.558
Bum buttery, flit fluttery
Dum diddly-ooh

01:46:38.762 --> 01:46:42.061
Bum buttery, bluebird
Is singing a tune

01:46:42.265 --> 01:46:45.632
Daffy-down-dillies awaken
And prune

01:46:45.835 --> 01:46:48.633
Bursting in bloom
All the flowers assume

01:46:48.838 --> 01:46:52.638
It's a loverly, loverly spring

01:47:00.083 --> 01:47:03.382
Chit-chattery chipmunks
All singing along

01:47:03.587 --> 01:47:06.988
Humming their
Join-in-a-spring-along song

01:47:07.190 --> 01:47:10.023
Spring is the springiest time
For a song

01:47:10.227 --> 01:47:13.628
It's a loverly, loverly spring

01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:17.391
In the forest we play
With the rabbits all day

01:47:17.601 --> 01:47:21.002
We visit the birdies
And fishes

01:47:21.204 --> 01:47:24.605
There's nary a care
When there's spring in the air

01:47:24.808 --> 01:47:28.403
The feeling is just
Too delicious

01:47:28.612 --> 01:47:32.013
Rum-buttery buttercups
All in a row

01:47:32.215 --> 01:47:35.514
Trilling and thrilling
And stealing the show

01:47:35.719 --> 01:47:38.620
May is the merriest month
That I know

01:47:38.822 --> 01:47:41.256
It's a loverly, loverly

01:47:41.458 --> 01:47:42.720
La-la-loverly

01:47:42.926 --> 01:47:45.952
La-la-la-loverly spring

01:47:45.953 --> 01:47:47.953
