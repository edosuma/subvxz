WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.370
Hey, fellas.

00:02.403 --> 00:05.039
I'm on antidepressants,
so I won't even cry after.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.483
ANNOUNCER:
FX presents Better Things.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.855
Om Mani Padme Hum.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.158
Om Mani...

00:24.192 --> 00:25.726
Can yo u guys maybe turn that
up?

00:25.759 --> 00:27.428
I can still hear other things.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.430
Sorry, Mom.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.732
FRANKIE:
And this is my kitchen,
everybody.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.734
Oh, and this is my mom.
Mom, say hi.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.537
You're on UVU.
I'm live-ing.
You're live.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.773
Frankie!
Oh, she's embarrassed
because she's in a towel.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.775
Are you serious right now?

00:45.779 --> 00:47.515
Wow.

00:47.548 --> 00:51.452
(episode of King of the Hill
continues indistinctly)

01:01.295 --> 01:05.133
Frankie, I'm sorry I threw
your phone in the sink.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.236
(sighs): But...
I'm in the kitchen

01:08.269 --> 01:10.104
in my towel,
and all of a sudden

01:10.138 --> 01:12.072
a bunch of strangers
are looking at me?

01:12.106 --> 01:14.475
We have to have some boundaries
with the phones.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.776
Okay?

01:15.809 --> 01:17.411
(sighs)
But yes,

01:17.445 --> 01:18.979
I'm sorry I lost control

01:19.012 --> 01:20.814
and I threw your phone away.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.816
That was not okay.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.552
So tomorrow...

01:24.585 --> 01:28.389
I'll take you, and we'll
get you a brand-new phone.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.791
Okay. Cool.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.626
(inhales deeply, exhales)

01:32.660 --> 01:35.163
Okay.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.033
(sighs)

01:42.970 --> 01:45.206
Oh, you're good.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.342
Heh. Oh-ho.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.245
* Mother

01:51.279 --> 01:54.748
* You had me

01:54.782 --> 01:59.520
* But I never had you

01:59.553 --> 02:01.355
*

02:03.624 --> 02:07.495
* I wanted you

02:09.163 --> 02:14.134
* You didn't want me.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.337
*

02:20.874 --> 02:22.810
Remember that person that came
to the house and, like...

02:22.843 --> 02:25.145
Yeah, Mom, what was
the name of that lady

02:25.179 --> 02:26.947
who came to sage our house?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.949
Oh, oh...

02:28.982 --> 02:30.851
um, Pussy...

02:30.884 --> 02:32.953
Pussy something?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.121
No.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.357
Shakuntala.
Shakuntala!

02:36.390 --> 02:38.459
Yeah! Yes!

02:38.492 --> 02:39.993
Oh, my God!
Shakuntala!

02:40.027 --> 02:41.128
SAM:
You guys want
smoothies?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.130
I'm making for Duke and Sorrow.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.065
(doorbell rings)
Oh, I'll get it.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.234
NARRATOR (on TV): This time
on Life After People...

02:46.267 --> 02:48.636
What else do you guys want
in your smoothies?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.971
Max, will you grab
the strawberries?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.406
What do you want
in your smoothies?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.308
* What do you want
in your smoothies? *

02:54.342 --> 02:56.176
* What do you
want in your smoothies? *

02:56.210 --> 02:58.679
* I'm gonna give you
strawberry. *

02:58.712 --> 03:01.014
You could put rocks and dog shit
in there, they wouldn't notice.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.550
I think they
would notice.
Hey.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.718
Hey, Jeff.
Sorrow, your dad.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.019
Come on, chimp.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.256
This is almost over.
Ten more minutes.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.057
Ay... Okay.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.058
Oh. Sorry.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.860
You want a smoothie?

03:12.893 --> 03:15.363
Sure. Would you be offended if
I put a little vodka in there?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.431
What, do you keep a flask
in your sock?

03:17.465 --> 03:20.167
No, I don't.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.236
Hey, do you have Sorrow
next weekend?

03:22.270 --> 03:23.871
No, that's Sunny's. Why?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.573
(blender and TV stop)
Well, because...

03:25.606 --> 03:26.707
Oh.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.776
Oh...
JEFF:
All right,

03:28.809 --> 03:30.344
everybody stay calm.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.945
(scoffing grunt)

03:31.979 --> 03:33.113
Mom, what happened?

03:33.146 --> 03:34.448
Mom, did you pay the power bill?

03:34.482 --> 03:35.516
What? Oh, my God.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.551
Mom. We were watching.

03:37.585 --> 03:40.988
Okay. Let me just...
I'll check the breaker box.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.130
Yeah, the power's

03:50.163 --> 03:51.865
really out.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.635
Mom, i-is this, like,
a nuclear strike or something?

03:54.668 --> 03:56.737
Uh, hold up.
What,
are you googling

03:56.770 --> 03:58.439
"was there just
a nuclear strike"?

03:58.472 --> 04:00.574
No. I'm...

04:00.608 --> 04:02.276
(phones beeping loudly)
SAM: Oh, shit.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.977
"Stand by
for emergency message."

04:04.011 --> 04:05.212
Shit, what?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.213
That's all it says.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.315
I can't make a call.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.082
Who are you calling?

04:09.116 --> 04:11.051
Dad.
JEFF: My phone
doesn't work, either.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.786
Neither does
mine. Mom?

04:12.820 --> 04:14.922
Guys... it's okay.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.290
It's the lights.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.758
It's not in our phones.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.159
It's here.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.428
Well, what if we had
an emergency?

04:20.461 --> 04:21.462
How would we tell anyone?

04:21.495 --> 04:22.763
Okay.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.998
And this, girls,

04:25.032 --> 04:27.735
is why we keep a landline.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.902
JEFF (chuckles):
Yeah. That's not

04:28.936 --> 04:31.138
gonna work, either--
those used to work

04:31.171 --> 04:32.606
in a blackout,
because they had

04:32.640 --> 04:34.241
their own dedicated
copper wiring.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.676
Landlines are bullshit now--
they're...

04:35.709 --> 04:36.810
tied into your cable.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.011
They're all digital.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.113
Oh, shit, you're right.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.350
(exhales):
Mom?

04:42.383 --> 04:44.284
Max... don't.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.453
It's okay, Max.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.254
SAM: And where are
all my candles?

04:47.287 --> 04:50.858
Will you girls stop stealing
candles for crying in the tub?

04:50.891 --> 04:53.461
You don't need candles, Sam--
it's still light out.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.128
SAM:
But that is why

04:55.162 --> 04:58.098
I need candles while
it's still light out, Frankie,

04:58.131 --> 04:59.767
before it gets dark.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.635
That's why I need candles now.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.937
Face!
MAX: Uh-oh, Mom,
I can't get the faucet to work.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.440
That's not electricity.
JEFF:
The water pump

05:06.474 --> 05:07.841
is electrical, too.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.110
Gran. I got to check on Gran.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.380
Who wants
to go with me?
Me.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.819
(door closes)

05:18.852 --> 05:20.354
What?

05:21.389 --> 05:23.290
Hi, Phil.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.825
Are you okay?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.794
Of course I am.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.961
Hi, Mrs. Geronimus.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.296
Hi.
Are you okay?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.699
My cat door isn't working.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.534
(air siren wailing)
Oh.

05:33.567 --> 05:37.004
Ooh. What the dirty
rotten shit is that now?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.640
That's... I don't know.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.308
Mom! Are we gonna die?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.210
No, not like this.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.545
What-what if you're wrong?

05:44.578 --> 05:45.846
What?

05:45.879 --> 05:48.649
What if we die after
you said we wouldn't?

05:48.682 --> 05:51.318
Oh, well, then whoops.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.420
(chuckles)

05:52.453 --> 05:54.087
(chuckling)

05:54.121 --> 05:55.322
(horn honking lightly)

05:55.355 --> 05:56.924
Hi.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.826
What's going on
with the power?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.260
It's just
a regional interruption.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.195
Should be back up in a minute.
Okay.

06:02.229 --> 06:05.198
MAN (over radio):
All clear.
Oh. There it is. Good to go.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.535
Oh. Cool.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.269
(air siren winds down)

06:09.302 --> 06:11.505
Okay, cool.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.373
Ah. Bye, Joyce.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.912
NARRATOR (on TV):
Will they be survived
(blender whirring)

06:18.946 --> 06:20.948
by other memorials to mankind?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.117
Jesus.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.953
Look at our lives.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.287
I know.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.723
Okay, fun's over,
everybody.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.459
(TV shuts off)

06:31.492 --> 06:33.927
(groans, sighs)

06:33.961 --> 06:35.362
You know,
you should get a generator.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.864
What for? We're fine.
Yeah, I know,

06:36.897 --> 06:39.266
but this stuff happens, and what
if next time it lasts longer?

06:39.299 --> 06:40.568
You should get a genny.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.936
Well, isn't that,
like, involved?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.538
No. It's, like, 300 bucks.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.807
Put some diesel in it,
let it sit in the garage,

06:46.840 --> 06:49.477
hook a power strip up to it,
and then if it happens again,

06:49.510 --> 06:52.212
it'll go for a couple days
on one tank.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.382
Okay, where do I get
one of those?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.250
DIY. I'm going there tomorrow
for some stuff.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.086
If you want,
I can swing by first,

06:59.119 --> 07:00.921
and I can help you get one.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.256
Okay. That would be awesome.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.196
What?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.067
Hey, buddy.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.769
Sammy.
(grunts)

07:16.770 --> 07:18.472
Ooh.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.108
All right.
(grunts)

07:23.443 --> 07:26.413
* Cellino & Barnes

07:26.446 --> 07:29.316
* Injury attorneys
* Attorneys

07:29.349 --> 07:31.318
* 888-88...
* 888-88...

07:31.351 --> 07:35.288
Oh, God. Oh, God.
(singsongy):
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

07:35.322 --> 07:37.024
Drive, drive,
drive, drive.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.191
Hello!
What do you
want me to do?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.192
Oh, God.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.261
Hello! Hello!

07:41.294 --> 07:43.430
Okay.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.098
Hello.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.433
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Phyllis.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.635
You're Bob.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.369
Yes. Bob.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.805
Mom, this is Jeff.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.373
No, it's Bob.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.642
That's right.
Sam, I'm Bob.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.043
Okay. Bye, Mom.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.277
Wait, where are you going?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.446
(sighs)
We're going to DIY.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.948
Oh, DIY.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.016
Yeah. You need something?

08:03.050 --> 08:05.452
Well, if you see a lavender suit

08:05.485 --> 08:07.821
or a merlot skirt...
What?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.222
Oh. Where are you going?

08:09.256 --> 08:11.491
DIY. They sell toilets

08:11.525 --> 08:14.027
and drywall and plungers.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.163
Well, if you see
a lavender suit...

08:16.196 --> 08:17.665
No.
Why not?

08:17.698 --> 08:18.999
Okay.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.734
I'll ask the guy
at the paint counter

08:20.768 --> 08:22.970
if he has
a lavender woman's suit.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.305
I don't know
why you can't just say,

08:25.338 --> 08:28.475
"Yes. I will if I see it.
I love you."

08:28.508 --> 08:30.611
You know why I can't, Phil?

08:31.845 --> 08:35.583
You know what, I-I don't know.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.918
I'm sorry.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.920
If I see one, I'll get you one.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.921
Thank you.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.355
And no buttons.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.191
I don't like
when they have buttons.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.425
(sighs)

08:45.458 --> 08:47.928
You mean on the suit
or on the skirt?

08:47.961 --> 08:48.929
The suit.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.064
I like buttons on a skirt.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.400
Wait, I got
to write this down.
No, I've got it all up here.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.703
Bye, Phil.
Bye!

08:59.707 --> 09:02.209
*

09:02.242 --> 09:05.245
BOTH (singing along):
* 'Cause when my baby is sad

09:05.278 --> 09:08.749
* You know that is bad

09:08.782 --> 09:12.686
* 'Cause she's the heart
of my heart *

09:12.720 --> 09:16.456
* And I'm her ol' dad

09:16.489 --> 09:20.293
* And I'll do anything
to put a smile on her face *

09:20.327 --> 09:24.297
* 'Cause seeing her sad
is just a big disgrace *

09:24.331 --> 09:26.066
* Seeing her sad

09:26.099 --> 09:29.903
* Is just a big disgrace.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.773
Yee-hee!
Yee-haw!

09:32.806 --> 09:36.910
But if she's his baby,
why is he her old dad?

09:36.944 --> 09:39.279
I think because it rhymes.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.149
And also because he's shtupping
his daughter.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.450
(snorts)

09:45.152 --> 09:49.189
(over radio):
* My memories...

09:50.991 --> 09:53.193
What?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.730
Nothing.

09:56.764 --> 10:00.167
What are you getting
at the hardware store?

10:01.601 --> 10:04.304
Just some wood
for Sunny's porch.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.507
(scoffs) You realize
you do ten times more for her

10:07.540 --> 10:09.176
since you guys divorced?

10:09.209 --> 10:10.944
Yes.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.680
She's got the sweetest deal.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.015
I mean, she's having a romance
with Mr. Private Jets,

10:15.048 --> 10:17.818
popping bottles, and she's got
her loser ex-husband doing

10:17.851 --> 10:19.486
all the chores.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.622
Okay.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.091
Do you want me to just go
ahead and I'll drop you off

10:24.124 --> 10:25.826
right over here?
Sure, that'd be great.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.661
I'll help that lady
sell oranges.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.029
(chuckles)

10:31.031 --> 10:33.000
So, the girls' dad...

10:33.033 --> 10:35.602
(sighs)
Xander.
Yeah.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.270
What's his, uh, deal?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.940
Oh, I just...

10:39.973 --> 10:42.943
I'd really rather not,
Jeff, thanks for asking.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.612
No, I know. But how often
does he see his girls?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.682
I can't.
I really can't.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.517
I would rather
show you my pussy

10:50.550 --> 10:52.119
than sit here
and talk about that.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.787
Oh. Well, okay.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.789
That would
be good, too.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.858
Shut up. You know
what I mean.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.126
(chuckles)

10:59.159 --> 11:01.128
I do, actually.

11:01.161 --> 11:05.198
I think the worst part about
divorce is being asked about it

11:05.232 --> 11:08.135
all... the... time.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.638
I mean, it's amazing how
nobody minds bringing it up.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.974
You know? Like I want
to talk about it?

11:14.007 --> 11:17.677
I'm fighting moment to moment
just to feel normal.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.414
Put one foot in
front of the other.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.683
Trying not to look down.
And people are like "Hey.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.353
"Hey, guy.
What about down?

11:26.386 --> 11:30.958
What's-what's going
on... down there?"

11:31.925 --> 11:34.762
I feel you, brah.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.906
So, this is the one
I have. Or Sunny has.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.175
Okay, fine.
I'll take it.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.178
Okay. Did you want to see
the others?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.713
What am I looking at?
It's all metal and plastic.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.083
It's like if you took
me to an alien store

11:56.116 --> 11:59.586
and you said, "You want
the zeep zop or the zorgle?"

11:59.619 --> 12:01.221
Whatever Sunny has.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.790
I'll have what she's having.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.724
Okay.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.260
So, how are we gonna get it out
of there?

12:07.294 --> 12:11.031
You rip the tag off and...

12:11.064 --> 12:13.901
and then they put it in the
trunk while you're checking out,

12:13.934 --> 12:15.135
same as my lumber.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.736
I get it.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.239
That's why you said
we don't need the cart.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.474
Yeah, yeah. That's okay.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.477
I'm stupid. Stup... I'm a girl.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.080
Slightly stupid. No harm done.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.448
(grunts)

12:28.481 --> 12:30.550
Okay, well,

12:30.583 --> 12:33.220
I still think
the cart is cool.

12:33.253 --> 12:38.225
It's like... I, like,
have made this kind of guy.

12:38.258 --> 12:43.063
(deep voice): "Excuse me, ma'am,
where can I put this for you?"

12:43.096 --> 12:45.065
It's like I
want everything.
(chuckles)

12:45.098 --> 12:48.468
Anyway, thanks for helping me
out, buddy. I appreciate it.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.070
It's no problem, buddy.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.973
You know, I kind of want
to do this other...

12:54.041 --> 12:55.809
What?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.620
ROBIN:
Mia,

13:07.654 --> 13:09.389
this is Sam.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.159
Hi.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.261
It's nice to meet you.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.496
Oh, hi.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.866
Nice to meet you, too.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.772
Hi. I'm buying a picture
of a generator.

13:25.805 --> 13:30.443
I just want to say one thing.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.079
I just want
to say that...

13:34.747 --> 13:36.749
...I miss you.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.890
And it sucks
not being with you anymore.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.664
Come on, Mia.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.879
Ugh!

14:05.913 --> 14:07.480
(groans)

14:07.514 --> 14:10.583
I hate myself
right now.

14:12.119 --> 14:15.222
Ugh! I'm the biggest
piece of shit in the world.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.590
Oh. (sighs)

14:17.624 --> 14:18.926
* Out west, nowhere...

14:18.959 --> 14:21.394
I deserve to be alone.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.896
And I didn't even
have the balls

14:22.930 --> 14:25.332
to just break up with him!

14:25.365 --> 14:27.367
Ooh!

14:28.268 --> 14:30.270
Damn it.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.706
Okay, Sam.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.742
SAM:
Ugh.

14:35.775 --> 14:38.045
I'm gonna have to throw
a little bit of a flag

14:38.078 --> 14:41.614
on the play, here, all right?
I don't know the story.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.616
Maybe you did
something sketchy.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.252
Whatever.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.687
Far be it from me,
of anyone...

14:47.720 --> 14:49.689
but the way he
came up to you

14:49.722 --> 14:51.124
with the whole, uh,

14:51.158 --> 14:52.392
"I just want to say

14:52.425 --> 14:54.727
I miss you,"
was a little...

14:54.761 --> 14:56.063
bitchy.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.231
Okay? And in front
of his daughter?

14:58.265 --> 14:59.632
No. I don't like it.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.634
All right? And, okay,

15:01.668 --> 15:03.036
that's, you know,
from an outsider,

15:03.070 --> 15:04.271
but also, for
a minute, Sam,

15:04.304 --> 15:05.805
just for a minute...

15:05.838 --> 15:08.775
You know that I couldn't
show up for my marriage.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.210
Right?
I wasn't there,

15:10.243 --> 15:11.878
I couldn't do it.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.313
And when I finally
screwed up enough

15:13.346 --> 15:15.815
to get out by mistake...

15:15.848 --> 15:17.484
on purpose--

15:17.517 --> 15:20.153
which sounds like what
you did with this guy--

15:20.187 --> 15:21.821
everybody hated me.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.923
And still does. I go to
pick up Sorrow from school,

15:23.957 --> 15:26.493
every mom, dad, teacher,
they look at me like I'm shit,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.128
okay? And I have
to live with that.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.463
I lost every friend, Sam--
every one of 'em--

15:30.497 --> 15:31.798
except for you, okay?

15:31.831 --> 15:33.466
You're the only one,

15:33.500 --> 15:35.768
literally the only one

15:35.802 --> 15:37.971
who let me off the hook
even just a little bit

15:38.005 --> 15:40.007
and let me live my life.
Because, for some reason,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.908
you decided that I'm
just a regular shithead

15:41.941 --> 15:43.743
who sucks at one thing.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.512
I guess what I'm
trying to say is that

15:45.545 --> 15:47.280
I wish that you
would give yourself

15:47.314 --> 15:50.117
some of the same understanding
that you've given me.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.853
And realize that maybe this
just wasn't for you right now,

15:53.886 --> 15:55.688
with that guy.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.457
And maybe, like a million
other shitheads, you just

15:57.490 --> 15:59.192
didn't know how to get out.
And maybe that means

15:59.226 --> 16:01.328
you're just not a
whole piece of shit.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.963
All right? I just wish
you'd give yourself

16:03.997 --> 16:06.633
a tiny bit of the kindness
that you've given me.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.170
* 'Cause we're living
in a world of fools *
That's what I wish you would do.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.839
* Breaking us down

16:12.872 --> 16:14.141
* When they all

16:14.174 --> 16:17.344
* Should let us be

16:17.377 --> 16:20.880
* We belong to you and me

16:20.913 --> 16:23.516
* I believe in you

16:23.550 --> 16:27.254
* You know the door
to my very soul *

16:29.056 --> 16:32.992
* You're the light
in my deepest, darkest hour *

16:33.026 --> 16:34.727
No!

16:34.761 --> 16:37.497
No, no, no.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.132
No, Jeff. No.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.834
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

16:41.868 --> 16:44.404
no, no, no, no, no, no... No!

16:44.437 --> 16:46.806
No. No. No, Jeff!

16:46.839 --> 16:48.908
No. No.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.710
No. No!

16:50.743 --> 16:52.045
* How deep is your...
(clicks off)

16:52.079 --> 16:53.313
No!

16:53.346 --> 16:55.682
No! No, Jeff.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.850
No. Jeff.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.223
No. No.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.325
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.994
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.197
No.
No, no, no, no,

17:10.230 --> 17:13.366
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

17:13.400 --> 17:16.336
Jeff. Jeff. Jeff.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.937
Jeff. No.

17:17.970 --> 17:21.174
No. No. No, Jeff.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.343
No! No.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.779
No. No, no, no, no, no.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.081
No.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.550
No. No. No. No,

17:30.583 --> 17:32.119
no, no, no, no.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.953
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

17:33.986 --> 17:37.090
no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.791
(panting): No.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.227
No.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.196
No. No.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.232
Right?

17:46.466 --> 17:47.967
Right?

17:51.238 --> 17:52.472
Well...
No!

17:52.505 --> 17:53.740
No, no, no, no,

17:53.773 --> 17:55.142
no, no, no, no!

17:55.175 --> 17:57.076
Not, "Well." No.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.545
No, Jeff.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.613
Jeff. No.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.082
Sam. Sam.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.585
This is so stupid.
You're so stupid.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.387
You're Sunny's
piece-of-shit ex-husband.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.089
You're Sorrow's dad.
You're Push's dad.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.493
You're my kid's favorite man
in the world, probably.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.895
Shut up. Shut up.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.064
Shut up.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.634
And, yes, you just said
an awesome thing.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.570
And it was really cool

18:23.603 --> 18:25.605
and a little bit sexy,

18:25.638 --> 18:29.276
but no! Jeff. No.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.778
I'm keeping my hand here,
because...

18:31.811 --> 18:35.014
this is a very no.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.817
Okay?

18:38.985 --> 18:41.354
We calm down.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.123
We calm down.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.860
Because this is a very no.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.696
No.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.698
And we just...

18:51.731 --> 18:53.733
let it go.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.912
(panting)

19:11.083 --> 19:13.453
Um... okay.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.488
I disagree.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.060
I think that we...

19:21.093 --> 19:22.329
should bone.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.164
Mainly because I really

19:25.198 --> 19:26.833
want to bone you right now.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.536
Ugh.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.472
(sighs)
Look, I just...
I'm making a suggestion.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.974
I want to make s... a-a
suggestion, okay? I'm just...

19:35.007 --> 19:38.211
I'm-I'm... I'm-I'm...
I'm-I'm putting this out there.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.749
The decision is
yours, clearly.

19:42.782 --> 19:46.386
I-If you were just to...

19:49.856 --> 19:51.824
...taste my dick,

19:51.858 --> 19:53.726
and then we just go...
Ew!

19:53.760 --> 19:55.228
Ew!

19:55.262 --> 19:58.030
Thank God! Thank God.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.400
Oh, my God, you suck.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.035
Thank God! Thank God!

20:05.272 --> 20:07.039
Oh, God.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.841
Whew!

20:08.875 --> 20:11.244
Yes.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.246
Oh.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.182
Hey.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.084
Oh, yes.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.552
Yes.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.020
Hey.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.890
Yes... yes.

20:26.259 --> 20:30.096
* And it's me you need to show

20:30.129 --> 20:31.898
* How deep is your love

20:31.931 --> 20:35.702
* How deep is your love,
how deep is your love *

20:35.735 --> 20:38.971
* I really mean to learn

20:39.005 --> 20:41.474
* 'Cause we're living

20:41.508 --> 20:44.110
* In a world of fools

20:44.143 --> 20:46.313
* Breaking us down

20:46.346 --> 20:47.814
* When they all

20:47.847 --> 20:51.217
* Should let us be

20:51.250 --> 20:54.821
* We belong to you and me

20:54.854 --> 20:56.856
(vocalizing)

21:11.838 --> 21:14.240
* And you come to me

21:14.273 --> 21:16.275
* On a summer breeze

21:16.309 --> 21:18.645
* Keep me warm in your love

21:18.678 --> 21:20.980
* Then you softly leave

21:21.013 --> 21:24.417
* And it's me you need to show

21:24.451 --> 21:26.185
* How deep is your love

21:26.218 --> 21:29.489
* How deep is your love,
how deep... *
