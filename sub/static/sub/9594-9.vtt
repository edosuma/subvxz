WEBVTT

00:22.823 --> 00:24.558
Temperature at 82 degrees.

00:24.658 --> 00:28.028
Wind gusting
from the southwest
at 10 knots.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.330
Clear skies.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.300
The conditions
are perfect for a...

00:32.400 --> 00:34.435
Beach day!

00:34.535 --> 00:35.769
Sand castle!

00:35.869 --> 00:37.638
Surfin'!

00:37.738 --> 00:39.173
Water!

00:39.273 --> 00:40.674
Seashells!

00:46.314 --> 00:47.348
What?

00:47.448 --> 00:49.717
Quarantine!
Quarantine!

00:53.321 --> 00:54.822
What did I do?

00:54.922 --> 00:56.157
You yawned, girl!

00:57.125 --> 00:58.326
Don't you know that yawns
are contagious?

00:58.426 --> 01:00.294
I have never
heard that, no.

01:00.394 --> 01:04.132
Everyone knows yawns
cause sleep. Except
for Starfire, I guess.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.800
Anyway, it's okay.
I think we caught it in time.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.469
That was close.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.174
Ah!

01:13.274 --> 01:15.409
It's...
It's not what you think.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.211
Let's hit the beach,
come on.

01:17.311 --> 01:20.248
I'm sorry, old friend.
It has to be this way.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.650
-No!

01:24.752 --> 01:26.687
I'll never forget you, buddy.

01:32.326 --> 01:35.763
Well, Raven, looks like
it's just you...

01:40.668 --> 01:43.737
These naps will not
be taken in vain.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.608
Must not yawn.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.411
Must show off beach bod.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.658
-Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.795
We slept through the most
perfect beach day
we'll see for the next...

02:07.895 --> 02:09.530
One, two, then carry the four,
add the leap year...

02:09.630 --> 02:12.433
Twenty four years

02:12.533 --> 02:14.535
I am sorry, fellow Titans.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.704
I did not know
about the yawns.

02:16.804 --> 02:17.805
It's all right.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.574
No, friend Cyborg,
it is the all wrong.

02:22.276 --> 02:25.646
This is not the first time
my ignorance of Earth culture
has ruined the merriment.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.882
-This new stereo
is the bomb!

02:29.517 --> 02:30.851
The bomb?

02:30.951 --> 02:32.553
MAN:
* It's time to break dance

02:34.922 --> 02:37.658
I will forever be
the celebration ruiner.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.361
Star, we love you
just the way you are.

02:40.461 --> 02:44.665
-Besides, the more you know,
the bigger bummer you are.
-Like Raven.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.868
Whoa!
I'm not a bummer.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.870
You're a total bummer,
Raven.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.206
Look at this chart
and you'll see
there's a direct correlation

02:52.306 --> 02:54.375
between knowledge
and being a bummer.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.244
Here's Beast Boy
and Cyborg.

02:56.344 --> 02:59.280
Together they know
virtually nothing
and everybody loves them.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.914
-Thanks, man.
-Aw!

03:01.014 --> 03:02.182
ROBIN: Here is me.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.352
I don't know too much
or too little,

03:05.853 --> 03:06.820
leaving people not feeling
very strongly about me
in one way or another.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.522
Hmm.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.825
And here's you, Raven.
You know a lot
and you bum everyone out.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.295
I do not wish
to be the bummer.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.672
You okay, Star?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.609
No, it has happened again.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.978
-A misunderstanding.

03:31.078 --> 03:35.416
Beast Boy asked me
to set him up
on the blind date.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.618
My eyes! My eyes!

03:37.718 --> 03:40.654
Why did you burn my eyes?

03:41.922 --> 03:43.891
Ow!

03:45.626 --> 03:46.960
BEAST BOY: Ah!

03:47.060 --> 03:49.530
I am the sorry!

03:49.630 --> 03:52.300
And the hopeless.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.238
Okay, wow.
Do you want me to teach
you some stuff?

03:58.339 --> 04:01.509
But will that
make me the bum?

04:01.609 --> 04:03.877
No way! Knowledge
is power, girlfriend.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.947
I'll give you a crash course
in all things Earth.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.384
I would prefer a course
without the crashing.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.286
Which brings me
to lesson one.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.788
Common expressions.
You don't have
to take everything literally.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.757
-You see, Star,

04:16.857 --> 04:19.660
it's all about adding
a little style into what
you're trying to say.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.994
Here's how you do it.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.600
* Don't say what you mean

04:26.700 --> 04:28.769
* But mean what you say

04:28.869 --> 04:33.273
* It sounds complicated
but it's easy in every way

04:33.374 --> 04:35.809
* Don't say you're goin'
to sleep, nuh-uh

04:35.909 --> 04:37.911
* Instead you're catching Z's

04:38.011 --> 04:40.448
* Never say that things
were easy, no

04:40.548 --> 04:42.650
* Just say
that they were a breeze

04:42.750 --> 04:44.752
* Instead of saying
watch how you spend

04:44.852 --> 04:47.020
* Say money
don't grow on trees

04:47.120 --> 04:49.657
* You see you say
what you got
to say every day

04:49.757 --> 04:51.825
* With style, that's the key

04:51.925 --> 04:54.395
* Don't say what you mean

04:54.495 --> 04:56.564
* But mean what you say

04:56.664 --> 04:58.799
* It's not that complicated,
no

04:58.899 --> 05:00.834
* It's easy in every way

05:01.635 --> 05:02.936
Uh-huh.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.572
You got this.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.610
-I believe I understand.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.580
Your song was
so kitten, dude.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.981
Kitten?

05:14.081 --> 05:17.851
Yes, the kittens are good
and so your song was good.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.687
Am I not meaning what I say?

05:19.787 --> 05:22.623
Ugh. Clearly a song
is not gonna do it.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.094
Oh, it is the okay.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.097
My ignorance will
always hold me back.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.334
Okay, okay.
Lesson number two.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.737
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

05:36.837 --> 05:41.742
Wear this magic relic tonight
and in the morning
you'll know everything.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.383
Oh, thank you, Raven.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.025
So, I checked the weather

05:58.125 --> 06:00.661
and today has all
of the perfect conditions

06:00.761 --> 06:02.963
for a lake day!

06:03.063 --> 06:04.532
Jet Skis!

06:04.632 --> 06:05.633
Fishing!

06:05.733 --> 06:07.034
Water!

06:07.134 --> 06:08.101
Pollution!

06:09.470 --> 06:14.842
Yeah, 46% of lakes
are too polluted
for recreational activities.

06:14.942 --> 06:18.378
Ugh! Why are we talking
about numbers on lake day?

06:18.479 --> 06:21.515
Because numbers reveal
undeniable facts, Beast Boy.

06:21.615 --> 06:25.118
Like 1.2 trillion gallons
of sewage are dumped
into lakes each year.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.054
Sewage? Ugh!

06:27.154 --> 06:29.957
Make her stop, Robin.
These facts
are bumming me out.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.627
What's gotten into you,
Starfire?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.963
Knowledge, Robin,
that's what.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.402
Raven, did you have
something to do with this?

06:42.503 --> 06:44.772
I may have taught her
a few things.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.607
I was just trying to help.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.442
This is what I wanted,
Robin.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.512
Now you won't have
to deal with me ruining
another occasion.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.946
You just ruined lake day!

06:53.046 --> 06:54.682
Knowledge is power,
Robin.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.517
This will only
make her stronger.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.818
Or a total bummer.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.553
That book is so overrated.

06:59.653 --> 07:03.056
I'll save you some time.
Everyone dies in the end.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.759
BOYS:  Bummer!

07:05.859 --> 07:07.795
Meditation can cause
problems ranging from

07:07.895 --> 07:09.797
muscle spasms
to hallucinations.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.732
BOYS:  Bummer!

07:12.700 --> 07:15.536
You do know those toys
are for babies.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.437
BOYS:  Bummer!

07:19.239 --> 07:20.508
Okay, you were right.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.042
She is kind of a bummer now.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.811
But I still say it was
an improvement.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.547
You guys want to know
where hamburger meat
comes from?

07:28.549 --> 07:29.717
What happened to Starfire?

07:29.817 --> 07:33.053
-Her brain is huge!
-That is just wrong!

07:33.153 --> 07:34.454
Raven!

07:34.555 --> 07:37.190
Okay,
this is all my fault.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.127
I used dark magic
to give Starfire
all human knowledge.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.229
Apparently it's expanding
too rapidly.

07:42.329 --> 07:45.866
If we don't go inside
and destroy it,
her head will explode.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.468
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

07:57.745 --> 08:01.114
Oh, look at
all that knowledge.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.685
It's unnatural
and it's growing
at an alarming rate.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.787
Then let's nuke some neurons!

08:06.887 --> 08:09.890
Fact attack! Fact attack!

08:15.295 --> 08:18.599
It's not working.
They're growing back, dudes.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.933
This is worse than I thought.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.902
We're gonna have
to take it out at the source.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.241
ROBIN: This must be it.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.978
Indeed! I am the source.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.914
I am knowledge,
facts and trivia!

08:34.014 --> 08:36.116
So you're the one
who made her a bummer!

08:36.216 --> 08:37.785
Yes, I am.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.887
And when I'm finished,
she'll be...

08:41.889 --> 08:44.157
One hundred percent bummer!

08:44.257 --> 08:45.659
Not on my watch.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.928
Titans, go!

08:48.028 --> 08:51.531
Seventy five percent
of missiles never reach
their intended targets.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.834
How did she know that?

08:54.267 --> 08:56.069
Fire lasers!

08:57.605 --> 09:00.741
Laser technology is
not advanced enough yet
to inflict any real damage.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.677
She's using facts and figures
to deflect our attacks!

09:03.777 --> 09:05.713
Allow me to teach you
another lesson.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.221
Her knowledge
is too powerful.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.689
We don't stand a chance.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.727
This is like shooting fish
in a barrel.

09:19.827 --> 09:22.596
The only way
to fight knowledge
is with ignorance.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.568
RAVEN: But I do not see
the fish or the barrels
anywhere.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.872
It is an expression, fools!

09:31.972 --> 09:35.208
I mean destroying you
will be a piece of cake!

09:36.243 --> 09:37.144
I like the cake.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.146
May I have
the strawberry flavor?

09:42.349 --> 09:45.786
I'm just trying
to put a little style
into what I say.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.155
Defeating you
will be a breeze.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.624
Breeze?
Do you need the coat?

09:53.961 --> 09:55.996
It's working.
She's weakened!

09:56.096 --> 09:57.765
Fire away, Robin!

09:57.865 --> 09:59.733
I've got one last
fact for you!

09:59.833 --> 10:02.970
The Titans win
100% of the time!

10:03.971 --> 10:06.106
Wait, is that true?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.884
How do you feel, Star?

10:18.151 --> 10:21.188
I feel as if a thousand
glinkglats are dancing
on my glipnorp.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.094
-She's back!
-Oh, yeah!

10:27.194 --> 10:28.261
Yes!

10:29.029 --> 10:30.297
I'm sorry, Star.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.632
I shouldn't have used magic
to cure your ignorance.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.868
I should have taken
the time to teach you
the old-fashioned way,

10:34.968 --> 10:38.772
with books and calculators
and protractors
and more books...

10:38.872 --> 10:40.407
BOYS:  Bummer!
