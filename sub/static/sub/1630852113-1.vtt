WEBVTT

02:33.588 --> 02:35.890
I hate that alarm clock.

02:38.793 --> 02:39.694
I got it.

02:50.505 --> 02:51.539
Stay.

02:54.609 --> 02:55.777
You know I can't.

02:55.810 --> 02:57.645
I've got a nice warm bed

02:57.679 --> 02:59.681
and some underwear
with your name on it.

03:06.921 --> 03:09.590
Promise me that when
your next deal is done,

03:09.624 --> 03:11.726
you'll take a few days off.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.827
Just you and me.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.233
I promise.

03:21.636 --> 03:22.670
Just you and me.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.242
Today, we close the
deal on the sale

03:29.276 --> 03:31.579
that we've been working
on the last few weeks.

03:32.714 --> 03:33.815
This is gonna be good for us.

03:33.848 --> 03:35.348
Sure it will.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.751
This is going
to be a good one.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.986
And when it is,
we can celebrate.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.387
Sounds like a plan.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.658
You know, I still don't get
why people pay so much money

03:43.691 --> 03:46.594
for an old painting or
some random dot on a page.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.930
It's because you
have no class, dear.

03:48.963 --> 03:50.898
Did you just hear that?

03:50.932 --> 03:51.999
What?

03:52.033 --> 03:55.435
I swore I just heard
something, oh, that was it.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.838
Said you needed one of these.

04:00.575 --> 04:02.877
They certainly broke the mold when
they made you, that's for sure.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.946
And that's exactly
why you love me.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.013
Ben?

05:57.592 --> 05:58.491
What are you doing?

05:58.526 --> 05:59.694
There was someone here.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.863
What?

06:01.896 --> 06:05.465
Someone was standing
where you are right now.

06:05.498 --> 06:08.669
Nope, just me.

06:08.703 --> 06:10.104
You okay?

06:10.137 --> 06:13.473
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.876
Are you sure?

06:14.909 --> 06:17.712
Yeah, how was your day?

06:19.714 --> 06:24.619
To be honest, if it started
bad, it just got worse.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.386
I take it the
sale didn't go through?

06:27.188 --> 06:30.691
In a nutshell, no
message, no calls, nothing.

06:30.725 --> 06:32.693
We had all the
papers ready to go.

06:32.727 --> 06:34.461
A complete time-waster.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.531
Now he's not even
returning our calls.

06:37.565 --> 06:42.737
So after sir's
hard day at work,

06:44.839 --> 06:49.644
maybe there's a way to help
take your mind off of things.

06:53.881 --> 06:57.551
Sorry, I'm just gonna grab
a shower and get to bed.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.719
It's been a hell-

06:58.753 --> 07:02.957
- It's fine, you just get
your head down and relax.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.992
Okay, thanks.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.634
Hey, Ellie.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.635
<i>How's my
favorite girl doing?</i>

08:21.669 --> 08:23.971
I'm good, just gettin'
on with my dissertation

08:24.005 --> 08:26.974
and it's killing me.

08:27.008 --> 08:33.014
15,672 words and counting.

08:33.948 --> 08:37.118
<i>Very precise,
it also sounds like hell.</i>

08:37.151 --> 08:38.486
It is.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.788
<i>I don't envy
you one bit right now.</i>

08:40.821 --> 08:42.156
Thanks for caring.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.025
<i>That's
what friends are for,</i>

08:44.058 --> 08:46.560
<i>but if you're busy, I can go.</i>

08:46.594 --> 08:47.595
No, it's okay.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.296
I could do with a
distraction, if I'm honest.

08:49.330 --> 08:51.832
<i>I was hoping
that you'd say that.</i>

08:51.866 --> 08:53.267
<i>I was thinking it's
been a little while</i>

08:53.300 --> 08:54.902
<i>since we had a bit
of a girl time.</i>

08:54.935 --> 08:57.772
<i>How about me and
you hit the Cuba?</i>

08:57.805 --> 08:58.439
Tonight?

08:58.472 --> 08:59.940
<i>Yeah, why not?</i>

09:01.275 --> 09:04.945
As much as I would love
a cocktail with my girl,

09:04.979 --> 09:07.148
I really can't tonight.

09:07.181 --> 09:08.716
<i>How about Thursday?</i>

09:08.749 --> 09:11.185
Perfect, that would
certainly be doing nice.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.255
<i>What was that noise?</i>

09:17.291 --> 09:18.993
You heard that?

09:19.026 --> 09:21.328
<i>Yeah, of course
I heard it. What was it?</i>

09:25.166 --> 09:26.000
<i>Lucy?</i>

09:31.739 --> 09:32.773
<i>Lucy?</i>

09:40.014 --> 09:42.083
<i>What, you okay?</i>

09:43.384 --> 09:46.754
Yeah, it was a crow.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.722
<i>What are
you talking about?</i>

09:48.756 --> 09:51.659
The sound we heard was
a crow hitting the window.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.893
<i>Ah, is it dead?</i>

09:52.927 --> 09:53.928
I think so.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.230
<i>Strange, they don't
normally kill themselves</i>

09:56.263 --> 09:57.431
<i>like that, unless,
I saw a thing-</i>

09:57.465 --> 10:01.068
- Please, I could really do
without any signs and advice

10:01.102 --> 10:02.203
on superstition right now.

10:04.138 --> 10:06.207
Just give me a minute
while I sort this out

10:06.240 --> 10:07.308
and I'll give you a call back.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.843
<i>All right, no worries.</i>

10:08.876 --> 10:10.044
<i>Let me know if
you need me, okay?</i>

10:10.077 --> 10:10.878
<i>I'll speak to you later.</i>

10:10.911 --> 10:11.979
Speak to you later.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.191
How's my girl doing?

10:57.224 --> 10:58.826
Missing you.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.693
How was your day?

11:03.063 --> 11:04.465
What?

11:04.498 --> 11:06.800
Nothing, just
admiring the view.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.403
Thank you.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.138
You're not so bad
yourself, mister.

11:13.508 --> 11:15.042
Did you speak to Jason today?

11:19.213 --> 11:20.748
You didn't say
anything, did you?

11:23.117 --> 11:25.252
You know you really
can't put this off?

11:25.286 --> 11:27.321
- As I said...
- Yeah, I'm fully aware of what you said.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.024
Can't I just come back,
say "Hi, honey, I'm home,"

11:30.057 --> 11:31.992
and just get on with it?

11:32.026 --> 11:34.428
If you really wanna know how my day
went, it was the same as yesterday.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.296
Shit.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.168
How was your day?

11:45.773 --> 11:48.042
I got most of my work done.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.044
Then I worked out on the bike

11:50.077 --> 11:52.446
and a crow killed itself
by hitting the window.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.480
What?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.350
Can I ask you a
random question?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.520
And I know this may sound a
little weird and out of the blue

11:58.553 --> 12:01.255
but who owned this
house before you?

12:02.356 --> 12:03.390
What's that gotta
do with anything?

12:03.424 --> 12:05.459
I'm just curious.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.127
I have no idea.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.395
It's a relatively new build.

12:08.429 --> 12:09.396
The owners no longer wanted it,

12:09.430 --> 12:12.866
so they moved out, moved
to Australia, I think.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.502
Did they ever tell
you anything about the house?

12:14.536 --> 12:16.303
Tell me about what?

12:16.337 --> 12:19.039
Anything strange
or odd happening?

12:19.073 --> 12:20.774
Why would they tell me that?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.310
I don't know.

12:23.344 --> 12:25.946
Maybe they were experiencing
something weird.

12:25.980 --> 12:28.048
You mean like, as
in being haunted?

12:30.284 --> 12:31.118
Maybe.

12:33.187 --> 12:36.457
Wow, this is a really
exciting conversation over here.

12:36.490 --> 12:41.195
Please, I've just been
feeling a little uneasy

12:41.228 --> 12:43.030
since I moved in, that's all.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.299
Uneasy about what?

12:45.332 --> 12:47.067
Like I can't settle.

12:47.101 --> 12:48.235
What the fuck does that mean?

12:50.304 --> 12:54.074
I just feel like sometimes
I'm not alone in the house.

12:54.108 --> 12:56.277
The house isn't
fucking haunted, Lucy!

13:04.184 --> 13:05.853
Do you know what?

13:05.886 --> 13:06.820
Don't worry about it.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.122
I won't, I'm off to bed.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.257
Ben, don't do that.

13:10.291 --> 13:11.358
Ben!

15:59.393 --> 16:01.094
It's definitely strange.

16:05.466 --> 16:08.035
You sure it wasn't
just some weirdo

16:08.068 --> 16:10.270
playing some kind of sick prank?

16:10.304 --> 16:12.607
There was no one there
when I took the picture.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.443
Come on, look, you
can clearly see it,

16:16.477 --> 16:18.746
it's some crank in
a coat or something.

16:18.780 --> 16:20.347
I'm not lying.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.583
You hear about
people pulling pranks

16:21.616 --> 16:23.250
like this all the time.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.085
Look at that clown craze
that was going around,

16:25.118 --> 16:27.421
where people were standing
outside in those clown suits.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.056
That was all kinds of messed up.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.258
I can promise you
there was no one there.

16:37.130 --> 16:40.334
There was no one there
when I took the picture.

16:41.736 --> 16:42.737
No one.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.509
If it's what you say, then...

16:49.176 --> 16:50.678
I guess you have
every right to be scared.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.309
What's this?

17:24.378 --> 17:27.180
Madam, dinner shall
be served in 10 minutes.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.550
Your presence is requested,

17:28.583 --> 17:31.385
should you care to indulge
in some ala carte food,

17:31.418 --> 17:33.688
served with nothing but love.

17:33.721 --> 17:35.623
What's on the menu?

17:35.657 --> 17:37.124
Pizza and chips.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.526
Oh, my favorite!

17:38.560 --> 17:40.528
You certainly know
how to treat a lady.

17:42.530 --> 17:43.731
Well, I'll go get ready.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.571
Lucy, I'm sorry
about last night.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.273
I've been under a lot of
pressure with work lately

17:53.307 --> 17:54.341
and I just...

17:58.746 --> 18:00.414
All work and no play, I guess.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.687
It's okay. I'm going
to go and get ready.

18:24.639 --> 18:26.908
Thank you for tonight.

18:26.941 --> 18:28.876
I really needed this.

18:28.910 --> 18:30.645
Are we out of the woods yet?

18:32.412 --> 18:35.583
I guess that depends
on what's for dessert.

18:35.617 --> 18:38.118
Ah, dessert.

18:38.953 --> 18:40.454
You forgot about it?

18:40.487 --> 18:41.823
Well, not exactly.

18:42.790 --> 18:44.892
There's custard in the fridge.

18:44.926 --> 18:45.760
Custard?

18:47.662 --> 18:50.598
Wow, you've really
blown it now, mister.

18:50.632 --> 18:53.467
You'll just have to make
it up to me some other way.

18:53.501 --> 18:54.669
And that is?

18:54.702 --> 18:57.505
For me to know and
for you to find out.

19:02.744 --> 19:04.378
I was thinking
about that picture

19:04.411 --> 19:06.514
that you sent me earlier.

19:06.547 --> 19:07.414
I was thinking-

19:07.447 --> 19:10.450
- Can we just leave
this until later?

19:10.484 --> 19:12.820
I just wanna enjoy
this moment with you.

19:12.854 --> 19:14.388
No interruptions.

19:15.389 --> 19:16.658
No interruptions.

19:43.584 --> 19:45.252
You're really something.

19:47.555 --> 19:49.624
I'm so lucky to have you.

19:50.892 --> 19:53.795
A girl could get used
to all these compliments.

19:53.828 --> 19:55.195
Keep 'em coming.

19:56.564 --> 19:57.565
I mean it.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.669
I know you do.

20:17.819 --> 20:22.623
I think I'm gonna get
another glass of wine,

20:22.657 --> 20:25.526
and then we're going upstairs.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.628
And you're getting me
out of these clothes.

20:57.959 --> 21:00.327
What the fuck
are you doing now?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.328
I did nothing.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.730
I turned around and all
the cupboards were open.

21:02.764 --> 21:04.599
They didn't just
open on their own!

21:04.632 --> 21:05.867
Why won't you believe me?

21:05.900 --> 21:08.368
What is it with you?
You really know how to fuck shit up!

21:11.572 --> 21:12.907
Lucy, I didn't mean, Lucy!

21:43.504 --> 21:44.572
I'm coming, Nana.

22:52.773 --> 22:54.474
It's out there!

22:54.508 --> 22:55.009
It's out there!

22:55.042 --> 22:56.177
What is?

22:56.210 --> 22:57.979
It was right by the door.

22:58.012 --> 22:59.146
There's nothing there.

22:59.180 --> 23:01.549
I promise you, I see it!

23:01.582 --> 23:02.415
See what?

23:02.449 --> 23:03.718
The man in the hat.

23:03.751 --> 23:05.686
Oh, this again?

23:05.720 --> 23:07.154
Please, Ben!

23:07.188 --> 23:08.522
I'm not lying to you.

23:08.556 --> 23:10.457
Just stop it, Lucy, stop it!

23:10.490 --> 23:11.759
What is it with you, huh?

23:11.792 --> 23:13.160
Huh?

23:13.194 --> 23:15.763
You don't believe me?

23:15.796 --> 23:18.132
Why won't you believe me?

23:51.599 --> 23:52.600
Look up for me.

23:53.868 --> 23:54.702
And to the left.

23:56.037 --> 23:56.871
And the right.

24:00.608 --> 24:01.842
Have you been
getting much sleep?

24:01.876 --> 24:02.977
A little.

24:03.010 --> 24:05.947
I guess I've been pretty
hectic with coursework lately.

24:05.980 --> 24:07.515
So not much sleep,
in other words?

24:09.216 --> 24:10.483
Apart from being
a little rundown,

24:10.518 --> 24:12.086
I can't see anything wrong.

24:12.119 --> 24:16.590
I would suggest trying to
take things a little easier

24:16.624 --> 24:19.593
and try and avoid too
much stress if you can.

24:19.627 --> 24:20.761
Here's what I'll do.

24:20.795 --> 24:23.496
I will prescribe
you some of these,

24:26.133 --> 24:28.636
and these will help you
sleep, if you need it, okay?

24:29.637 --> 24:30.237
There you go.

24:30.271 --> 24:31.471
Great.

24:33.774 --> 24:36.811
There I was studying to help
others deal with their problems,

24:36.844 --> 24:38.980
and here I am unable
to deal with my own.

24:49.824 --> 24:50.992
Ah, babe, don't get upset.

24:52.059 --> 24:53.060
You'll work it out.

24:55.963 --> 24:58.132
So have you told
him how you feel?

24:58.165 --> 25:01.869
No, I just can't bring
myself to say anything.

25:01.902 --> 25:06.907
I don't wanna say it, but
maybe he just needs to lose you.

25:08.576 --> 25:09.877
You're not helping, Ellie.

25:09.910 --> 25:11.579
No, what I mean is,

25:11.612 --> 25:14.715
when he realizes what
you actually mean to him,

25:14.749 --> 25:16.751
you'll be gone and
it'll be too late.

25:18.652 --> 25:21.288
You're a great girl
who any guy would give

25:21.322 --> 25:24.925
his right testicle to be with.

25:24.959 --> 25:27.995
Look at you, you're a stunner.

25:28.029 --> 25:29.063
I definitely wouldn't say no.

25:30.664 --> 25:33.334
Oh great, now you're
trying to hit on me.

25:33.367 --> 25:34.568
You're a funny one.

25:34.602 --> 25:35.236
That's me.

25:36.370 --> 25:38.939
You know I'm here for you
if you ever need anything.

25:40.808 --> 25:45.012
I hate seeing you upset because
you deserve to be happy.

25:45.046 --> 25:46.714
And if that means

25:46.747 --> 25:48.849
that you need to tell
him exactly how you feel,

25:48.883 --> 25:51.652
then you need to tell
him exactly how you feel.

25:55.022 --> 25:56.023
Thank you.

25:57.058 --> 25:57.892
It's nothing.

26:00.361 --> 26:02.663
I just like to see
my girl doing well.

26:27.922 --> 26:29.223
You have seen him.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.257
Pardon?

26:31.192 --> 26:33.627
You've
seen him, haven't you?

26:35.362 --> 26:38.065
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:39.934 --> 26:45.072
You can't run. The man in
the hat, you've seen him.

26:45.106 --> 26:45.873
Get off of me.

26:45.906 --> 26:48.876
He won't stop
until he has you.

26:48.909 --> 26:51.011
Don't let him in.

26:51.045 --> 26:52.746
Get off me!

27:03.157 --> 27:07.094
The woman I just
mentioned approached me

27:07.128 --> 27:08.929
in the toilet earlier,

27:08.963 --> 27:12.266
and started talking about
the shadow man in the photo,

27:12.299 --> 27:16.170
and how I shouldn't let him
in or something like that.

27:16.203 --> 27:18.405
Was she a psychic
or something?

27:18.439 --> 27:21.175
I don't know. She
didn't say who she was.

27:21.208 --> 27:22.176
That's a bit odd.

27:24.211 --> 27:26.947
I really don't know what to say.

27:26.981 --> 27:29.984
I mean, there must be
someone or somewhere

27:30.017 --> 27:32.987
that you can go to
talk to you about that.

27:33.020 --> 27:35.289
Like a church or something.

27:35.322 --> 27:36.891
I honestly don't
know. I haven't looked.

27:37.892 --> 27:40.027
Well, let's get looking.

27:40.060 --> 27:41.028
Maybe we need to find someone

27:41.061 --> 27:46.066
that focuses on spirits
or ghosts or something.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.936
I know I probably
sound really crazy.

27:48.969 --> 27:50.004
You don't sound crazy.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.173
It's me.

27:54.074 --> 27:56.010
Back home, there were
all these stories

27:56.043 --> 28:00.881
about La Bruja, which
means witch in English.

28:00.915 --> 28:03.083
There were all these reports
of young boys being woken up

28:03.117 --> 28:05.152
in the middle of the night

28:05.186 --> 28:06.954
and being held down
by this shadow.

28:08.255 --> 28:09.356
And they'd wake
up with scratches

28:09.390 --> 28:11.058
all up their arms and legs.

28:12.826 --> 28:16.897
I knew one of the guys
and I saw the scratches.

28:18.199 --> 28:19.166
So I believe you.

28:25.406 --> 28:26.941
Ah, here you go.

28:29.009 --> 28:30.110
Dr. David Andrews.

28:32.046 --> 28:36.050
He's the author of a book
called "Walking With Shadows."

28:36.083 --> 28:37.384
And by the looks of it,

28:37.418 --> 28:39.220
he claims to have had
a ghostly encounter

28:39.253 --> 28:40.821
with the man in the hat.

28:43.891 --> 28:45.025
Seems like you're
not the only one

28:45.059 --> 28:48.395
that's seen this
guy, shadow thing.

28:50.864 --> 28:55.069
It also says seeing the shadow
man, AKA a man in the hat

28:55.102 --> 28:58.906
usually has a connotation to
a sense of heavy presences,

28:58.939 --> 29:01.775
tense and sometimes
violent atmospheres

29:01.809 --> 29:04.111
through relationship,
marital breakdowns,

29:04.144 --> 29:06.146
and or physical
and mental abuse.

29:08.215 --> 29:11.151
Visitations of the hat
man, even though uncommon,

29:11.185 --> 29:13.387
usually occur in a
heightened state of sleep

29:13.420 --> 29:16.524
where an individual wakes
up and is paralyzed.

29:16.558 --> 29:19.493
The phenomenon known
as sleep paralysis

29:21.563 --> 29:27.434
shares common blah-blah-blah,
he's your guy.

29:29.036 --> 29:31.805
There's a phone number and an
address here on the website.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.408
All you have to do is reach out.

29:36.277 --> 29:37.311
What have you got to lose?

30:15.482 --> 30:16.283
Yes?

30:16.317 --> 30:18.586
Hi, Dr. David Andrews?

30:18.620 --> 30:21.155
Whatever you're trying to get me
to sign up to, I'm not interested.

30:21.188 --> 30:23.123
I promise you, I'm not
trying to sell anything.

30:23.157 --> 30:25.192
I just really need
to talk to you.

30:25.225 --> 30:26.093
Good day.

30:26.126 --> 30:28.530
Please, it's about
the man in the hat

30:28.563 --> 30:29.930
that you talk
about in your book.

30:31.265 --> 30:32.299
I've seen him.

30:46.980 --> 30:47.981
Have a seat.

31:49.376 --> 31:51.078
Found what you're looking for?

31:52.379 --> 31:54.415
Oh, I'm sorry, I just-

31:54.448 --> 31:56.450
- Let's just cut to
the chase, shall we?

31:59.253 --> 31:59.888
Why are you here?

32:02.456 --> 32:04.425
I don't know what else to do.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.561
I was hoping maybe
you could help.

32:06.594 --> 32:07.995
What makes you
think I have answers

32:08.028 --> 32:09.597
to whatever it is
you want to ask?

32:11.165 --> 32:11.965
I don't know.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.068
In your book, you wrote about-

32:15.102 --> 32:16.103
- Ah, the book.

32:17.271 --> 32:18.939
The book, the book, the book.

32:21.108 --> 32:23.277
Been a little while since
anyone asked me about that.

32:26.648 --> 32:28.516
You're a journalist, aren't you?

32:28.550 --> 32:31.151
A journalist looking for
a free ride and a laugh,

32:31.185 --> 32:32.286
just like all the rest.

32:33.588 --> 32:35.355
You care not for
the consequence.

32:35.389 --> 32:37.291
Just the result of a good story.

32:39.426 --> 32:40.628
Go ahead and take your shot.

32:43.263 --> 32:44.566
At the moment,
there's no one here.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.434
Just me now.

32:52.239 --> 32:54.241
I shouldn't have come here.

32:54.274 --> 32:55.610
Sorry for wasting your time.

32:57.344 --> 32:59.179
It's attracted to
stress, you know.

33:02.483 --> 33:03.651
What did you say?

33:04.719 --> 33:10.390
Stress, it,

33:10.424 --> 33:12.192
they, him.

33:13.628 --> 33:14.995
They're attracted to it.

33:16.764 --> 33:18.065
Why do you say that?

33:21.268 --> 33:22.436
It's why you're
here, isn't it?

33:27.174 --> 33:29.511
I've seen that look before.

33:29.544 --> 33:31.579
What are you talking about?

33:31.613 --> 33:32.446
Fear.

33:33.681 --> 33:35.617
I can see it dwelling
in your eyes.

33:37.819 --> 33:39.521
I know that look all too well.

33:41.523 --> 33:44.324
It's your eyes
that gave you away.

33:44.358 --> 33:47.327
You have a certain humility
that's quite endearing.

33:47.361 --> 33:49.463
A little too honest
to be a journalist.

33:52.466 --> 33:54.802
I'm sorry about
being tough on you.

33:54.836 --> 33:56.370
I just needed to be sure.

33:57.371 --> 34:00.675
It's okay, I understand.

34:00.708 --> 34:02.075
I don't think you do.

34:03.343 --> 34:04.378
What have you seen?

34:05.680 --> 34:09.049
I saw something.

34:10.217 --> 34:11.385
What
did it look like?

34:13.287 --> 34:18.091
Tall, black hole
of a man in a hat.

34:19.326 --> 34:22.262
Like the drawings in your book.

34:22.296 --> 34:25.633
If you've seen him,
they already have started.

34:27.702 --> 34:29.704
What has started?

34:29.737 --> 34:31.506
Seems you may
have been chosen.

34:35.208 --> 34:36.778
What?

34:36.811 --> 34:38.178
What do you mean?

34:39.413 --> 34:41.415
I could never
really figure out why.

34:42.884 --> 34:45.620
It could be an opening
from a childhood trauma.

34:45.653 --> 34:48.422
A house you live in,
the land, perhaps.

34:50.223 --> 34:50.858
Who knows?

34:53.460 --> 34:54.862
The only thing I
could ever be sure of

34:54.896 --> 34:59.333
was that it's like a
parasite looking for a host,

34:59.366 --> 35:01.168
any sign of weakness,

35:01.201 --> 35:03.538
any opportunity to feed
off negative energy,

35:03.571 --> 35:04.639
it'll thrive from it.

35:08.543 --> 35:09.711
You have seen the entity.

35:12.346 --> 35:14.481
My guess is it's attached
itself to you already.

35:17.351 --> 35:18.720
It's only a matter of time now.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.189
Time?

35:22.222 --> 35:22.857
Until what?

35:35.469 --> 35:38.271
I'm not sure if
you're a person of faith

35:38.305 --> 35:40.340
or if you even believe
in the supernatural,

35:41.609 --> 35:43.578
but if you're ever
gonna start praying,

35:45.345 --> 35:46.614
now would be a good time.

35:48.382 --> 35:50.150
And what's that
supposed to mean?

35:53.253 --> 35:54.321
Dr. Andrews, tell me.

35:59.627 --> 36:01.428
It's time you leave.

36:01.461 --> 36:03.296
I've got work to do.

36:03.330 --> 36:05.600
But, but you-

36:05.633 --> 36:07.334
- You must go now!

36:09.369 --> 36:10.538
Thank you for your time.

36:11.606 --> 36:13.273
My name's Lucy, by the way.

36:15.610 --> 36:19.312
Lucy, no matter
what anyone says,

36:20.615 --> 36:22.416
or however crazy you might feel,

36:24.585 --> 36:25.653
don't let him in.

38:08.823 --> 38:09.891
Lucy.

38:11.793 --> 38:12.627
Nan?

38:44.759 --> 38:45.793
Hello?

40:19.921 --> 40:21.421
I love you, darling.

40:22.823 --> 40:24.058
I love you too, Nana.

40:26.060 --> 40:27.528
I love you too.

40:29.797 --> 40:31.232
Thank you for letting him in.

44:27.434 --> 44:29.136
Can you believe this?

44:29.170 --> 44:30.771
They've been talking about
this so-called government deal

44:30.804 --> 44:33.307
for months now, and they
still can't decide what to do.

44:33.340 --> 44:35.976
And you would've think they knew what
they were doing with this country.

44:36.010 --> 44:38.012
It's almost like they want
the economy to collapse.

44:42.183 --> 44:44.018
Is the heating off?

44:44.051 --> 44:45.052
It's cold.

44:46.153 --> 44:48.322
It's no different from
any other morning this week.

44:49.823 --> 44:51.992
Where were you last night?

44:52.026 --> 44:54.862
Just thought it best
to give you some space.

44:54.895 --> 44:55.796
How thoughtful.

44:55.829 --> 44:57.831
Please, let's not argue again.

44:57.865 --> 44:59.800
If we've got nothing nice
to say, I'd rather not talk.

44:59.833 --> 45:00.434
Always running away.

45:00.467 --> 45:01.368
What's that mean?

45:02.937 --> 45:03.771
Nothing, Ben.

45:05.139 --> 45:05.973
Nothing.

45:10.110 --> 45:11.812
My Nan used to make me waffles.

45:14.048 --> 45:17.885
It's funny, the
memories we hold on to,

45:17.918 --> 45:20.054
it's always the little
things we miss the most.

45:21.322 --> 45:23.090
I never did tell
you the real reason

45:23.123 --> 45:24.124
why I lived with my Nan.

45:26.060 --> 45:30.097
It feels like the more I
try to hide from my past,

45:30.130 --> 45:32.466
the further I can feel
you slipping away.

45:32.499 --> 45:34.368
Where's this all come from?

45:34.401 --> 45:36.403
I know it's been two years
since you lost your Nan,

45:36.437 --> 45:38.072
and there's nothing
wrong with grieving.

45:38.105 --> 45:39.173
No.

45:39.206 --> 45:41.141
But some people take more
time to get over things.

45:41.175 --> 45:42.544
I mean it's fine.
It's perfectly normal.

45:42.577 --> 45:43.444
It's not about that.

45:43.477 --> 45:44.111
Maybe we should
get you checked out.

45:44.144 --> 45:45.513
Seeing all the doctors help-

45:45.547 --> 45:46.914
- It's not about that!

45:47.915 --> 45:51.919
God, why won't you
ever listen to me?

45:57.424 --> 45:59.960
You didn't finish
what you were saying,

45:59.994 --> 46:02.863
about why you lived
with your Nan.

46:02.896 --> 46:04.231
Forget about it,
it doesn't matter.

46:04.265 --> 46:06.233
No, it does matter, it does.

46:06.267 --> 46:09.036
We just both need to let our
guards down for a moment.

46:16.277 --> 46:19.213
For a big part
of my younger life,

46:19.246 --> 46:26.287
I was terrorized by
things I couldn't explain.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.389
Things a little girl
should never see.

46:30.190 --> 46:34.596
My mum and dad thought
that I was being tormented

46:34.629 --> 46:38.899
by demons and that I
needed to find faith.

46:40.134 --> 46:43.203
So they would wake me up
in the middle of the night

46:43.237 --> 46:45.172
and stand me naked in the garden

46:45.205 --> 46:48.208
as they splashed
me with holy water,

46:48.242 --> 46:51.111
reciting prayers from the Bible.

46:51.145 --> 46:53.147
Eventually I tried to run away.

46:53.180 --> 46:55.916
Anywhere was better than
living there with them.

46:58.252 --> 47:00.321
And that's when
my Nan took me in.

47:00.354 --> 47:05.125
All my crazy experiences
stopped soon after.

47:05.159 --> 47:09.163
For the first time in
my life, I felt free.

47:11.165 --> 47:14.201
Free from the pain,
free from the suffering.

47:16.604 --> 47:20.974
That was until last night,
when I felt it again.

47:23.143 --> 47:27.114
I'm scared, Ben.
I'm really scared.

47:27.147 --> 47:29.149
I've never seen you like this.

47:29.183 --> 47:30.184
What happened last night?

47:30.217 --> 47:31.418
I know this sounds crazy.

47:31.452 --> 47:34.321
I even told myself how
stupid this sounds,

47:34.355 --> 47:37.291
but I was attacked in
our bedroom last night.

47:37.324 --> 47:39.293
I don't know who or what it was.

47:39.326 --> 47:43.430
I couldn't see it, but
there was something there.

47:43.464 --> 47:49.203
And ever since it happened,
I just don't feel right.

47:51.205 --> 47:52.339
What? Why didn't you just-

47:52.373 --> 47:56.477
- I feel like I'm falling apart.

47:56.511 --> 47:57.878
And I don't know what to do.

49:09.416 --> 49:12.019
Is
everything okay, my child?

49:12.052 --> 49:12.654
I'm fine.

49:14.188 --> 49:15.489
I can pray for
you, if you like?

49:15.523 --> 49:16.490
I said I'm fine.

50:18.285 --> 50:19.654
Hi, is that Father Roberts?

50:21.523 --> 50:24.324
Hi, my name's Lucy Morgan.

50:24.358 --> 50:25.560
I'm pretty new to the area,

50:25.593 --> 50:28.328
and I just wondered if I could
speak with you for a moment.

50:31.431 --> 50:33.835
I'm sorry, this can't wait.

50:33.868 --> 50:36.203
I really need to speak
to you. It's urgent.

50:51.753 --> 50:55.155
I don't blame you if
you want to leave.

50:59.594 --> 51:01.495
I spoke to Jason
earlier today.

51:03.565 --> 51:04.599
Told him that I'm going to think

51:04.632 --> 51:06.366
about our business arrangement,

51:08.168 --> 51:09.537
and I needed a few days off.

51:38.900 --> 51:40.602
Do you think
we're gonna make it?

51:43.738 --> 51:45.172
I don't know.

51:51.613 --> 51:52.479
I love you.

51:54.214 --> 51:55.550
I love you too.

52:07.929 --> 52:09.296
Can I get you a drink?

52:10.565 --> 52:11.498
What's on the menu?

52:11.532 --> 52:14.836
We have coffee, tea, water,

52:14.869 --> 52:17.705
and hot chocolate
with whipped cream.

52:17.739 --> 52:20.842
Hmm, it'll just have
to be hot chocolate

52:20.875 --> 52:22.577
and whipped cream, I guess.

52:22.610 --> 52:23.645
Got it.

54:18.693 --> 54:19.727
Hey!

54:23.030 --> 54:24.297
What's up, what's wrong?

54:57.397 --> 54:59.634
Lucy, pleasure to meet you.

55:03.905 --> 55:06.107
Thank you for this.

55:06.140 --> 55:09.510
Sorry if I don't
seem too with it,

55:09.544 --> 55:12.513
I really haven't been
sleeping too well lately.

55:12.547 --> 55:14.782
Sometimes we all
go through something

55:14.816 --> 55:16.984
that forces us in
different directions.

55:18.052 --> 55:19.086
If only you knew.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.655
That's why I'm here.

55:24.125 --> 55:25.560
What do you fear?

55:30.497 --> 55:33.835
Fear is a very relative term.

55:36.904 --> 55:39.006
When one learns to be
at peace with the Lord,

55:39.040 --> 55:41.108
your perception of fear changes.

55:42.143 --> 55:43.678
Do you know what I fear?

55:45.412 --> 55:46.413
The unknown.

55:48.182 --> 55:51.919
I was attacked the other night
by a presence I couldn't see.

55:53.187 --> 55:54.989
And it happened
again last night.

55:56.691 --> 55:58.960
Where did this attack happen?

55:58.993 --> 56:01.128
In the bedroom
and the bathroom.

56:01.162 --> 56:02.830
Were you alone at the time?

56:02.864 --> 56:06.701
For the first one,
yes, but not last night.

56:06.734 --> 56:08.636
My partner, Ben, was downstairs.

56:09.637 --> 56:11.739
Did he see anything?

56:11.772 --> 56:15.408
No, my head doesn't
feel like me anymore,

56:16.811 --> 56:19.847
now it feels like day
and day feels like night.

56:23.184 --> 56:24.785
Have you tried prayer?

56:27.755 --> 56:30.457
I respect that you believe
you're being troubled

56:30.490 --> 56:33.060
by forces unseen.

56:33.094 --> 56:35.796
And this is to sound
in no way patronizing,

56:35.830 --> 56:40.835
but sometimes we can
think things are real,

56:42.169 --> 56:46.073
when in actuality, there's
another explanation,

56:46.107 --> 56:47.675
not of the supernatural.

56:51.145 --> 56:51.946
I know this might not-

56:51.979 --> 56:55.516
- Can you help or not?

57:02.489 --> 57:03.124
Okay.

57:05.860 --> 57:09.931
I don't have much experience
with things of this nature,

57:09.964 --> 57:11.999
but if you would permit me to,

57:12.033 --> 57:13.801
I would like to
offer up some comfort

57:13.834 --> 57:15.603
in the form of a house blessing.

57:17.138 --> 57:19.106
Just something to help
put your mind at ease

57:19.140 --> 57:20.908
and we can take it from there.

57:22.777 --> 57:23.811
Thank you.

57:28.282 --> 57:30.584
And what did you
say your address was?

57:30.618 --> 57:32.887
11 Croswell Drive.

57:32.920 --> 57:36.857
11 Croswell Drive?

57:36.891 --> 57:38.960
Could you do me a favor
and write down for me?

57:59.280 --> 58:00.480
Lucy?

58:58.873 --> 59:02.810
Sorry to trouble you. This is
11 Croswell Drive, isn't it?

59:02.843 --> 59:05.146
It is. How may I help?

59:05.179 --> 59:08.249
You must be Ben. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

59:08.282 --> 59:10.651
My name is Father
William Roberts.

59:10.684 --> 59:13.788
I believe I was speaking with
your partner earlier on today.

59:13.821 --> 59:14.588
Lucy?

59:17.291 --> 59:19.360
I know this visit is
completely unannounced

59:19.393 --> 59:21.762
but she left in rather a hurry

59:21.796 --> 59:24.065
and I just want to
make sure she's okay.

59:24.098 --> 59:26.333
Yeah, she's fine. Thanks.

59:26.367 --> 59:28.069
Do you mind if I
speak with her briefly?

59:29.403 --> 59:30.971
I'm afraid now
is not a good time.

59:32.807 --> 59:33.908
I respect your territory

59:35.042 --> 59:37.778
and the fact this may be a
complete surprise for you.

59:37.812 --> 59:39.246
If you could tell
her that I called,

59:39.280 --> 59:40.781
I would appreciate that.

59:40.815 --> 59:41.782
No worries.

59:41.816 --> 59:42.883
Thank you, kindly.

59:42.917 --> 59:44.318
Hi, Father.

59:44.351 --> 59:45.219
Lucy.

59:45.252 --> 59:46.854
Thanks for coming.

59:46.887 --> 59:48.055
Please, come in.

1:00:15.449 --> 1:00:16.984
It's a nice place
you've got here.

1:00:17.017 --> 1:00:20.020
Thanks. Do you want a drink?

1:00:20.054 --> 1:00:22.022
Coffee, tea, anything?

1:00:22.056 --> 1:00:24.024
Just a water will be fine.

1:00:24.058 --> 1:00:25.092
Thank you.

1:00:38.839 --> 1:00:40.875
I'm here for you.

1:00:40.908 --> 1:00:42.409
The Lord is here for you.

1:00:43.444 --> 1:00:45.146
Here you go, priest.

1:00:45.179 --> 1:00:46.013
Thank you.

1:00:48.849 --> 1:00:50.718
You seemed somewhat
troubled earlier.

1:00:52.286 --> 1:00:53.287
Is all okay?

1:00:54.388 --> 1:00:57.992
It's funny. As
children, we're told

1:00:58.025 --> 1:01:00.094
there's no such
thing as monsters

1:01:00.127 --> 1:01:02.062
and we shouldn't be
afraid of the dark.

1:01:05.065 --> 1:01:06.700
We both know that's not true.

1:01:11.405 --> 1:01:15.309
There may be forces
that we can't see at play,

1:01:15.342 --> 1:01:17.378
but that doesn't always
mean they're malevolent.

1:01:17.411 --> 1:01:19.046
What happens when they are?

1:01:22.082 --> 1:01:23.918
Do you feel a
presence with us now?

1:01:23.951 --> 1:01:26.153
Since the other
night, it's never left.

1:01:26.187 --> 1:01:27.188
Where is it?

1:01:29.490 --> 1:01:31.025
Everywhere.

1:01:34.261 --> 1:01:35.696
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

1:01:36.531 --> 1:01:37.998
Why?

1:01:38.032 --> 1:01:41.235
Listen to yourself.
You sound nuts.

1:01:41.268 --> 1:01:43.003
Lucy has reason
to believe she's-

1:01:43.037 --> 1:01:45.839
- Please, priest, I
don't mean to be rude-

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:47.007
- Ben, please.
- And I appreciate

1:01:47.041 --> 1:01:48.475
that you're here to help.

1:01:48.510 --> 1:01:50.811
But let's not jump
to any conclusions.

1:01:50.844 --> 1:01:53.347
I don't want her head more
confused than it already is

1:01:53.380 --> 1:01:55.282
with all this
spiritual ghost crap.

1:01:56.217 --> 1:01:58.886
I'm sure there's probably
a more logical explanation

1:01:58.919 --> 1:02:00.020
for all of this.

1:02:00.054 --> 1:02:02.456
What, that I strangled
myself and I'm making this up?

1:02:02.489 --> 1:02:04.491
Why can't you just believe me?

1:02:04.526 --> 1:02:07.027
I... I just can't.

1:02:07.061 --> 1:02:11.865
I accept and love
you, not for your money,

1:02:11.899 --> 1:02:14.168
not for what you can
give me, just for you.

1:02:16.237 --> 1:02:20.107
And I need you now
more than ever.

1:02:22.176 --> 1:02:25.412
As I said earlier, I
respect your territory

1:02:25.446 --> 1:02:27.414
and your beliefs.

1:02:27.448 --> 1:02:29.883
All I have is a few questions
I'd like to ask Lucy

1:02:29.917 --> 1:02:31.151
and then I'll be on my way.

1:02:33.153 --> 1:02:35.089
Seems that you both
have more to discuss

1:02:35.122 --> 1:02:36.857
before we can move forward.

1:02:48.435 --> 1:02:49.270
What's this?

1:02:51.171 --> 1:02:52.006
Open it.

1:03:07.288 --> 1:03:09.123
What does it mean?

1:03:11.158 --> 1:03:12.192
You have no idea?

1:03:14.928 --> 1:03:15.863
You wrote it.

1:03:17.632 --> 1:03:19.933
No way. How can I write this

1:03:19.967 --> 1:03:21.969
when I don't even
know what it says?

1:03:23.437 --> 1:03:27.408
The writing here is
in an old Latin text.

1:03:27.441 --> 1:03:29.209
And what does it say?

1:03:29.243 --> 1:03:30.612
I don't think what
it says is really-

1:03:30.645 --> 1:03:34.114
- Please, I need to know.

1:03:43.924 --> 1:03:46.994
The Latin text you
wrote translates to

1:03:50.397 --> 1:03:51.566
I have her now.

1:03:53.601 --> 1:03:56.003
So you're writing
in Latin now?

1:03:56.036 --> 1:03:58.005
I have no idea
how I wrote this.

1:03:58.038 --> 1:03:59.206
Maybe you didn't.

1:04:03.277 --> 1:04:04.646
Do you mind if I
use the bathroom?

1:04:04.679 --> 1:04:06.280
Upstairs, first door in front.

1:04:59.233 --> 1:05:01.402
For Michael, the Archangel,

1:05:01.435 --> 1:05:04.639
oh, glorious prince of
the heavenly armies,

1:05:04.672 --> 1:05:08.008
defend us in battle
and protect us

1:05:08.041 --> 1:05:10.244
against the wickedness
and tyranny of the devil.

1:05:43.076 --> 1:05:44.311
You okay, Lucy?

1:05:51.351 --> 1:05:52.386
Lucy?

1:05:53.621 --> 1:05:56.624
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:07:44.832 --> 1:07:47.835
Lucy, are you coming to bed?

1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:14.227
Babe, just come back to bed.

1:08:21.903 --> 1:08:22.837
Lucy?

1:08:29.443 --> 1:08:30.444
Lucy, open the door!

1:08:31.579 --> 1:08:32.446
Lucy, open up!

1:09:11.953 --> 1:09:13.153
Lucy.

1:09:21.963 --> 1:09:23.330
What are you doing?

1:09:45.602 --> 1:09:49.064
Holy Mary, Mother of God

1:09:49.106 --> 1:09:51.899
pray for us sinners,

1:09:51.942 --> 1:09:55.153
now and at the hour of our death...

1:10:05.807 --> 1:10:10.545
Amen!

1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:43.010
Sometimes I feel
it is important

1:10:43.044 --> 1:10:46.848
that we know abundance
is our birthright.

1:10:49.617 --> 1:10:54.622
The mental prison we condemn
ourselves to is not fulfilling

1:10:57.424 --> 1:11:00.862
or even gratifying
when we judge others

1:11:00.895 --> 1:11:03.396
and ourselves so harshly.

1:11:06.567 --> 1:11:08.468
The intended purpose of...

1:11:15.442 --> 1:11:17.477
The intended purpose...

1:11:38.132 --> 1:11:39.634
Hello?

1:11:39.667 --> 1:11:40.902
<i>Father Roberts?</i>

1:11:40.935 --> 1:11:42.970
That's I.

1:11:43.004 --> 1:11:44.337
Who's calling?

1:11:44.371 --> 1:11:48.776
<i>It's Ben. You came
to visit Lucy earlier today.</i>

1:11:48.810 --> 1:11:49.744
Ah, yes.

1:11:51.478 --> 1:11:53.446
What can I do for you?

1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:54.549
<i>Is there any,</i>

1:11:56.150 --> 1:11:58.986
<i>any chance you can
come by tonight?</i>

1:12:00.121 --> 1:12:01.656
<i>Something's not right with Lucy.</i>

1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:06.761
I'm afraid that I-

1:12:06.794 --> 1:12:10.798
- <i>Please, I
don't know what to do.</i>

1:12:10.832 --> 1:12:13.835
<i>But that, that is not Lucy.</i>

1:12:16.671 --> 1:12:18.639
I'll be right over.

1:12:18.673 --> 1:12:19.841
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:13:38.653 --> 1:13:39.687
Thank you for coming.

1:13:42.857 --> 1:13:43.858
How is she?

1:14:02.777 --> 1:14:03.611
She's been better.

1:14:05.179 --> 1:14:06.981
I'm sorry. This is
really hard for me.

1:14:07.014 --> 1:14:09.116
I've never seen anything
like this before.

1:14:10.785 --> 1:14:12.586
Where's Lucy?

1:14:12.620 --> 1:14:13.988
Upstairs, in the bedroom.

1:14:23.564 --> 1:14:27.635
Is there anything you feel
you should tell me first?

1:14:27.668 --> 1:14:31.605
Please, she's upstairs.
You've gotta see for yourself.

1:14:35.475 --> 1:14:36.978
Do you mind if I
use your counter?

1:14:39.647 --> 1:14:40.648
Go for it.

1:15:49.717 --> 1:15:51.218
Upstairs on the right.

1:16:01.896 --> 1:16:04.565
I'm not going up there.
I...

1:16:06.634 --> 1:16:07.701
I just need a minute.

1:16:10.671 --> 1:16:11.972
You've done the right thing.

1:16:47.942 --> 1:16:48.776
Lucy?

1:16:53.047 --> 1:16:55.950
It's me, Father Roberts.

1:16:58.452 --> 1:17:00.287
Ben asked if I could
pay you a visit.

1:17:06.060 --> 1:17:07.094
Lucy.

1:17:17.137 --> 1:17:20.641
What do you want, Father?

1:17:23.377 --> 1:17:24.745
Who are you?

1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:42.663
This one is mine.

1:17:47.902 --> 1:17:48.903
Child of the Lord,

1:17:49.904 --> 1:17:52.206
I pray that you shall
be guided and protected

1:17:52.239 --> 1:17:54.175
from the light of
the heavenly father,

1:17:54.208 --> 1:17:57.311
and that you shall be
freed from any affliction

1:17:57.344 --> 1:18:00.281
and demonic forces
around you now.

1:18:00.314 --> 1:18:02.883
Our father, who art in heaven.

1:18:05.219 --> 1:18:06.220
Help me.

1:18:10.057 --> 1:18:13.360
There is
absolutely no possible way

1:18:13.394 --> 1:18:15.429
it can be done that quickly.

1:18:15.462 --> 1:18:17.231
Please,
just listen to the recording.

1:18:17.264 --> 1:18:18.999
That's all I ask.

1:18:19.033 --> 1:18:22.836
Even if I did,
it changes nothing.

1:18:22.870 --> 1:18:25.039
It's out of my hands.

1:18:26.173 --> 1:18:28.876
There must be
something you can do.

1:18:28.909 --> 1:18:32.112
I'm sorry, father. But
you have to understand,

1:18:32.146 --> 1:18:35.082
you're not asking for
a simple blessing here.

1:18:35.115 --> 1:18:39.053
It is a very delicate situation

1:18:39.086 --> 1:18:42.389
and the correct channels
must be followed accordingly.

1:18:44.491 --> 1:18:46.360
We have to be prudent.

1:18:46.393 --> 1:18:48.729
You see, that's the
problem we have here.

1:18:49.531 --> 1:18:52.099
The time in the
world moves forward,

1:18:52.132 --> 1:18:54.301
and yet we, as the
church, stand still

1:18:54.335 --> 1:18:57.805
and then you call
this approach prudent.

1:18:57.838 --> 1:19:00.040
More like cowardice,
if you ask me.

1:19:00.074 --> 1:19:04.311
I didn't ask you. You
are to do as instructed.

1:19:04.345 --> 1:19:06.847
Whether we like it or not,

1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:09.083
the enemy is winning the battle,

1:19:09.116 --> 1:19:12.052
while we sit here and debate
on rules and regulations.

1:19:12.086 --> 1:19:16.190
And it is by following
those rules and regulations

1:19:16.223 --> 1:19:19.793
that we keep the dignity
and the very foundations

1:19:19.827 --> 1:19:22.229
of the church together.

1:19:22.263 --> 1:19:25.032
We cannot go around
conducting any sort

1:19:25.065 --> 1:19:28.469
of miscellaneous practice
however we see fit,

1:19:30.004 --> 1:19:33.173
without proper assessment
and consultation.

1:19:33.207 --> 1:19:34.942
That is not how it works.

1:19:34.975 --> 1:19:36.410
Let me just talk
to the Bishop.

1:19:40.247 --> 1:19:44.418
I can explain why this
woman, in my own opinion,

1:19:44.451 --> 1:19:49.189
needs a rite of exorcism,
but most of all, our help.

1:19:58.932 --> 1:20:01.035
You never see what I saw.

1:20:03.270 --> 1:20:07.841
The diabolical influence
attached to this woman is real,

1:20:07.875 --> 1:20:10.077
and unlike anything
I've ever seen.

1:20:16.417 --> 1:20:18.952
The Bishop doesn't
need to say yes,

1:20:18.986 --> 1:20:20.821
but let me plead my case.

1:20:23.324 --> 1:20:28.596
Without careful consideration

1:20:28.630 --> 1:20:32.966
and approval from the Bishop,

1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:37.304
you cannot, by any means,

1:20:37.338 --> 1:20:39.574
pursue this matter further,

1:20:41.475 --> 1:20:44.912
until I have spoken
with the Bishop myself.

1:20:46.180 --> 1:20:47.848
Is that understood?

1:20:49.016 --> 1:20:52.286
The tyranny of evil
triumphs, chancellor,

1:20:52.319 --> 1:20:55.856
when good people stand by
and do nothing to help.

1:21:54.415 --> 1:21:57.384
Still reading
your Bible, I see.

1:21:57.418 --> 1:21:59.353
Thank you for coming.

1:21:59.386 --> 1:22:00.287
Don't mention it.

1:22:02.690 --> 1:22:05.627
It's been a little while since
I've been in one of these.

1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:07.361
It most certainly has.

1:22:09.196 --> 1:22:11.165
Things are not what
they used to be.

1:22:11.198 --> 1:22:12.399
You can say that again.

1:22:17.371 --> 1:22:18.405
Miss it?

1:22:19.707 --> 1:22:22.376
Not really. Still enjoy it?

1:22:25.647 --> 1:22:30.417
It has its own cross to
bear, but like all things,

1:22:30.451 --> 1:22:32.319
silver lining and all that.

1:22:32.352 --> 1:22:34.455
Sounds like the
same place of old.

1:22:34.488 --> 1:22:35.690
Same place of old.

1:22:39.159 --> 1:22:41.729
I know you've been
through a lot.

1:22:41.763 --> 1:22:43.464
I'm always here
when you need me.

1:22:45.466 --> 1:22:49.637
Do you mind if we cut all
the how are you, how am I crap?

1:22:50.638 --> 1:22:53.608
I know you didn't call me here
just to see how things are.

1:22:55.777 --> 1:22:59.246
There's no other way
than for me just to say it,

1:23:00.481 --> 1:23:02.316
and you're one of the
only people I can trust

1:23:02.349 --> 1:23:04.117
with what I'm about to say.

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:08.322
I need to perform
a rite of exorcism.

1:23:10.057 --> 1:23:12.359
Did those words just
come out of your mouth?

1:23:12.392 --> 1:23:15.763
You want to perform an exorcism?

1:23:15.797 --> 1:23:18.499
Sorry, deliverance ministry?

1:23:18.533 --> 1:23:20.300
Yeah.

1:23:20.334 --> 1:23:21.168
On who?

1:23:23.237 --> 1:23:26.039
A desperate woman
with no options left,

1:23:30.277 --> 1:23:32.179
and it has to happen soon.

1:23:32.212 --> 1:23:36.350
Tomorrow, in fact, the
clock is against me on this.

1:23:36.383 --> 1:23:38.118
Tomorrow?

1:23:38.151 --> 1:23:40.320
You know that won't go
down well with the Bishop?

1:23:40.354 --> 1:23:43.490
Will take a few weeks at
best for him to sanction it,

1:23:43.525 --> 1:23:45.192
and that's even if he does.

1:23:46.528 --> 1:23:48.128
And I thought I was bad.

1:23:48.161 --> 1:23:49.564
Coming from the man
who has lost faith

1:23:49.597 --> 1:23:51.064
and walked away from life?

1:23:51.098 --> 1:23:53.501
When I believed
my wife should live

1:23:53.535 --> 1:23:55.703
and he decided otherwise.

1:23:55.737 --> 1:23:58.105
Let's just say we had
a conflict of interest.

1:23:58.138 --> 1:24:01.108
I would not call running
away a conflict of interest.

1:24:01.141 --> 1:24:02.844
I did not run away.

1:24:02.877 --> 1:24:06.714
I made a choice for
myself, no guilt trips,

1:24:06.748 --> 1:24:08.448
no one to ask for guidance.

1:24:08.482 --> 1:24:10.718
Just me deciding
what I want for me.

1:24:13.888 --> 1:24:18.125
Like you, I got into
the act of God's work

1:24:18.158 --> 1:24:19.827
because I wanted to help people.

1:24:21.261 --> 1:24:23.363
Those who are vulnerable,

1:24:23.397 --> 1:24:25.533
those who do not have
a voice of their own,

1:24:27.535 --> 1:24:32.840
the woman. This couple that
I speak of need our help.

1:24:32.874 --> 1:24:34.408
Our help?

1:24:34.441 --> 1:24:36.511
What have I got to do with it?

1:24:36.544 --> 1:24:37.344
I need you.

1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:40.615
I can't do this alone.

1:24:40.648 --> 1:24:41.849
I'm not going to help you

1:24:41.883 --> 1:24:45.753
while you go on rough shot,
conducting your own exorcisms

1:24:45.787 --> 1:24:48.155
like some sort of witch doctor.

1:24:48.188 --> 1:24:51.659
Look, I really
wish I could help,

1:24:51.693 --> 1:24:53.393
but I'm not the man I once was.

1:24:53.427 --> 1:24:55.295
Yes, you are.

1:24:55.329 --> 1:24:58.131
You were one of the best
ministers that I knew.

1:24:58.165 --> 1:24:59.601
Well, that was before.

1:24:59.634 --> 1:25:03.470
You cannot keep yourself
a slave to the past forever.

1:25:05.907 --> 1:25:06.874
It changes nothing.

1:25:09.577 --> 1:25:12.179
Unfortunately, death is
as much a part of life

1:25:12.212 --> 1:25:13.514
as life is to itself.

1:25:15.917 --> 1:25:17.919
It wasn't your fault, you know?

1:25:17.952 --> 1:25:21.589
You're right. It
wasn't my fault.

1:25:21.623 --> 1:25:23.490
I know whose fault it was.

1:25:25.459 --> 1:25:30.430
Him on high, our
oh, precious one.

1:25:31.833 --> 1:25:37.672
31 years I spent. 31 years,
devoted, loving, and caring

1:25:37.705 --> 1:25:40.575
doing the work for someone else.

1:25:40.608 --> 1:25:43.578
What thanks did I get?

1:25:43.611 --> 1:25:45.445
I tell you what I get.

1:25:45.479 --> 1:25:49.617
People like you telling
me that I lost my wife

1:25:49.651 --> 1:25:52.720
and it was all because
the Lord called her home.

1:25:52.754 --> 1:25:54.454
I'm sick of it.

1:25:54.488 --> 1:25:56.289
Sick of Him.

1:25:56.323 --> 1:25:59.359
I'm sick of faith, religion.
I'm done with it all.

1:26:03.330 --> 1:26:05.566
You will find the
latest incident on there.

1:26:07.669 --> 1:26:11.939
She needs our help and
that's what I'm going to do.

1:26:11.973 --> 1:26:14.575
Alone and without consent.

1:26:21.381 --> 1:26:24.217
I can't live my life
concerned only by myself.

1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:30.625
You know something, you were
once someone I looked up to.

1:26:30.658 --> 1:26:31.759
Interesting, isn't it?

1:26:33.460 --> 1:26:34.796
What is?

1:26:34.829 --> 1:26:36.296
How things change.

1:26:38.533 --> 1:26:40.200
Sorry for wasting your time.

1:27:11.733 --> 1:27:12.900
Hello?

1:27:12.934 --> 1:27:16.804
<i>William, I
listened to the recording.</i>

1:27:16.838 --> 1:27:19.372
<i>What time are you
leaving tomorrow?</i>

1:27:19.406 --> 1:27:21.976
I'll be heading over
about seven in the evening.

1:27:22.009 --> 1:27:24.545
<i>How long does
it take to get there?</i>

1:27:24.579 --> 1:27:27.347
20 minutes, give or take?

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:28.783
<i>I'll get to you for six.</i>

1:27:30.752 --> 1:27:31.753
Change your mind?

1:27:43.664 --> 1:27:45.800
Don't you think
you've drunk enough?

1:27:45.833 --> 1:27:46.667
Nope.

1:27:49.637 --> 1:27:50.638
Whatever you're doing

1:27:50.671 --> 1:27:52.774
or however you think
you're dealing with this,

1:27:52.807 --> 1:27:55.308
you being out of it
isn't gonna help Lucy.

1:27:56.811 --> 1:27:58.813
You know the priest
wants to do an exorcism

1:27:58.846 --> 1:28:00.748
on her tomorrow, right?

1:28:02.449 --> 1:28:03.684
Now, how would I know that?

1:28:05.052 --> 1:28:06.754
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1:28:11.092 --> 1:28:12.627
I just thought
you should know.

1:28:15.462 --> 1:28:17.297
Are you even being
serious right now?

1:28:18.099 --> 1:28:21.569
You can be a real fucking
pig sometimes, you know that?

1:28:21.602 --> 1:28:23.436
All you're doing right now
is thinking about yourself

1:28:23.470 --> 1:28:24.605
while the woman who loves you

1:28:24.639 --> 1:28:29.710
and needs you is upstairs
dealing with God knows what?

1:28:32.113 --> 1:28:33.681
And all you can do is this.

1:28:34.682 --> 1:28:39.452
Oh, fuck.

1:28:39.486 --> 1:28:40.121
Fuck!

1:28:43.157 --> 1:28:44.826
I'm gonna go check on Lucy.

1:28:59.140 --> 1:29:00.608
Are you asleep?

1:29:03.010 --> 1:29:03.978
Lucy?

1:29:21.929 --> 1:29:22.930
Lucy?

1:30:14.582 --> 1:30:15.549
Ellie?

1:30:22.757 --> 1:30:23.724
Ellie!

1:30:23.758 --> 1:30:24.725
Ben?

1:30:24.759 --> 1:30:25.860
I wanna get out.

1:30:25.893 --> 1:30:27.161
Let go of the handle!

1:30:27.194 --> 1:30:28.729
I'm not holding it!

1:30:30.164 --> 1:30:31.198
I can't open it!

1:30:31.232 --> 1:30:32.767
Get me out, please!

1:30:33.935 --> 1:30:35.102
It won't move!

1:30:45.846 --> 1:30:48.215
Get me out,
please get me out!

1:30:48.249 --> 1:30:49.617
I'm trying!

1:30:54.255 --> 1:30:55.623
I see it.

1:30:56.791 --> 1:30:58.659
I see it!

1:31:04.265 --> 1:31:05.800
I've had fucking
enough of this!

1:34:19.994 --> 1:34:20.961
Hello!

1:34:59.033 --> 1:35:01.001
What's going on?

1:35:01.035 --> 1:35:01.835
It's gonna be okay.

1:35:01.869 --> 1:35:03.103
Don't talk to it.

1:35:06.874 --> 1:35:08.108
This is not Lucy.

1:35:10.110 --> 1:35:11.078
Why am I tied up?

1:35:12.514 --> 1:35:16.116
Ben, please, untie me.

1:35:18.152 --> 1:35:19.186
Ben!

1:35:21.422 --> 1:35:22.323
Untie me!

1:35:25.226 --> 1:35:29.063
Lord Jesus Christ,
ruler over the heavens,

1:35:30.431 --> 1:35:32.066
I'm here as your servant.

1:35:33.267 --> 1:35:34.201
Have mercy.

1:35:37.238 --> 1:35:38.239
Have mercy.

1:35:41.475 --> 1:35:45.045
In the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

1:35:45.079 --> 1:35:47.114
by the power of his cross,

1:35:47.147 --> 1:35:49.183
his blood and his resurrection,

1:35:51.285 --> 1:35:54.421
I bind you, Satan, and
the powers of darkness.

1:35:56.156 --> 1:35:59.126
I take authority over you,

1:35:59.159 --> 1:36:02.496
and stand with the power
of the Lord God almighty.

1:36:05.224 --> 1:36:09.895
I, the dealer of death,

1:36:09.937 --> 1:36:15.275
condemn you to a thousand
serpents of pain.

1:36:17.579 --> 1:36:21.448
Reveal yourself,
creature of the night.

1:36:24.184 --> 1:36:27.254
We are many!

1:36:27.288 --> 1:36:28.155
Lucy?

1:36:28.188 --> 1:36:29.356
Don't talk to it!

1:36:31.325 --> 1:36:34.128
Together, the Lord's prayer.

1:36:36.497 --> 1:36:40.134
Our father,
who art in heaven,

1:36:40.167 --> 1:36:43.571
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come.

1:36:44.972 --> 1:36:48.842
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

1:36:48.876 --> 1:36:52.246
Give us this day
our daily bread,

1:36:52.279 --> 1:36:54.415
and forgive us our trespasses

1:36:54.448 --> 1:36:58.553
as we forgive those who
trespass against us,

1:36:58.586 --> 1:37:03.257
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1:37:06.243 --> 1:37:08.453
Holy Mary, Mother of God

1:37:08.495 --> 1:37:10.330
pray for us sinners,

1:37:10.372 --> 1:37:13.083
now and at the hour of our death...

1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:15.102
Reveal yourself to me, demon!

1:37:27.081 --> 1:37:28.082
I'm sorry!

1:37:39.126 --> 1:37:43.565
I stand with the power
of the Lord God almighty.

1:37:46.333 --> 1:37:47.502
Tell me your name.

1:37:49.504 --> 1:37:54.074
I am the bearer of darkness
that consumes the night

1:37:54.108 --> 1:37:57.878
and we are legion.

1:38:12.694 --> 1:38:16.397
And she will burn.

1:38:25.472 --> 1:38:26.373
The power's out!

1:38:31.011 --> 1:38:33.180
It's no longer
safe for you both.

1:38:33.213 --> 1:38:34.181
I need you to stay here.

1:38:34.214 --> 1:38:35.349
But wouldn't it-

1:38:35.382 --> 1:38:37.418
- I'm afraid you'll only be
putting yourself in danger

1:38:37.451 --> 1:38:38.620
as well as Lucy.

1:40:10.377 --> 1:40:11.211
Lucy?

1:40:22.356 --> 1:40:23.490
Fight it, child.

1:40:25.627 --> 1:40:31.365
By the power invested in
me, I command you, legion,

1:40:31.398 --> 1:40:33.166
to leave this woman at once.

1:41:09.236 --> 1:41:12.840
Lucy, if you can hear me,

1:41:12.874 --> 1:41:14.742
resist the dark spirit.

1:41:20.414 --> 1:41:22.115
Most unclean spirit,

1:41:23.585 --> 1:41:25.853
in the name of
our almighty Lord,

1:41:25.887 --> 1:41:29.156
I command you to leave
this woman at once.

1:41:42.937 --> 1:41:45.439
Most unclean spirit,

1:41:45.472 --> 1:41:48.442
in the name of
our almighty Lord,

1:41:48.475 --> 1:41:52.614
I command you to leave
this woman at once.

1:41:54.448 --> 1:41:57.619
I will not leave.

1:41:58.519 --> 1:42:03.423
She is mine forever!

1:42:03.457 --> 1:42:05.459
In the name of Christ,

1:42:05.492 --> 1:42:08.395
I command you, legion, to part.

1:42:08.428 --> 1:42:13.735
Most unclean spirit, return
to the depths of darkness

1:42:13.768 --> 1:42:17.538
and burn in the eternal flame.

1:42:17.572 --> 1:42:19.172
Most unclean spirit,

1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:21.776
in the name of our mighty-

1:42:21.809 --> 1:42:25.747
- I command you, legion,
most unclean spirit,

1:42:25.780 --> 1:42:27.715
return to the darkness

1:42:27.749 --> 1:42:31.485
and burn in the
eternal flames of hell.

1:42:32.954 --> 1:42:37.391
In the name of the
almighty God, return!

1:43:29.610 --> 1:43:30.712
Stop the car.

1:43:37.284 --> 1:43:38.686
What is it?

1:43:45.660 --> 1:43:46.694
It's nothing.
