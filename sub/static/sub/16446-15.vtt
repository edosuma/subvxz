00:00.660 --> 00:04.000
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- DAN: <i>Still no sign of Lucifer?</i>

00:04.041 --> 00:05.773
It's been two weeks. He's gone.

00:05.809 --> 00:06.840
LUCIFER: Detective!

00:06.843 --> 00:08.273
<i>Meet Candy Morningstar,</i>

00:08.276 --> 00:09.744
- my wife.
- (giggles)

00:09.780 --> 00:11.512
Lucifer's concocting a plan.

00:11.515 --> 00:13.315
What if there is no hidden agenda, Mom?

00:13.317 --> 00:14.482
Why would I be surprised?

00:14.518 --> 00:16.484
<i>You disappeared after I almost died?</i>

00:16.520 --> 00:19.287
Does Chloe know that you <i>zagged</i> Candy?

00:19.323 --> 00:20.588
Everything I felt for her

00:20.624 --> 00:21.605
<i>was smoke and mirrors,</i>

00:21.608 --> 00:22.729
<i>courtesy of Dad.</i>

00:22.732 --> 00:24.525
So it's okay to ignore her feelings?

00:24.528 --> 00:25.828
Feelings that aren't real.

00:25.831 --> 00:26.862
But she doesn't know that.

00:26.864 --> 00:28.863
Which is why I had to save her!

00:28.899 --> 00:29.931
From you.

00:29.967 --> 00:31.199
I manipulated him.

00:31.235 --> 00:32.934
I pushed him too hard.

00:32.970 --> 00:34.034
I did this.

00:34.037 --> 00:35.803
The Oscar goes to Candy Morningstar.

00:35.839 --> 00:37.238
You think they bought it?

00:37.274 --> 00:38.714
My mother doesn't know what hit her.

00:38.742 --> 00:39.974
Thank you for helping me

00:40.010 --> 00:42.243
peek inside that scheming head of hers.

00:42.279 --> 00:44.646
What if I told you that
the Flaming Sword is

00:44.649 --> 00:45.958
<i>Azrael's blade?</i>

00:45.961 --> 00:48.406
<i>The weapon that can cut through
the Gates of Heaven itself.</i>

00:48.409 --> 00:50.520
We have everything we need to go home.

00:55.893 --> 00:57.692
Azrael's blade.

00:57.728 --> 00:58.659
You're sure?

00:58.695 --> 01:00.061
I am.

01:00.097 --> 01:01.396
So if we could just get your brother

01:01.398 --> 01:05.199
to stop drinking and
show us where he hid it...

01:05.235 --> 01:08.636
I just wanted you to
tell him what you told me,

01:08.672 --> 01:10.004
before I make a mess.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.274
What mess are you going to...

01:14.091 --> 01:16.693
That's where it's been this whole time?

01:17.612 --> 01:19.681
Put it somewhere I
could keep an eye on it.

01:19.683 --> 01:21.149
Wouldn't want someone to incite another

01:21.151 --> 01:22.583
stabbing rampage, now, would we?

01:22.619 --> 01:25.119
Well, it's not my fault
humans can't handle the divine.

01:25.155 --> 01:26.487
Besides, if I hadn't done that,

01:26.523 --> 01:30.007
we wouldn't have found out
what that blade actually is.

01:30.010 --> 01:32.693
And you really think that
this is the Flaming Sword?

01:32.729 --> 01:34.956
I thought Father destroyed
it during my rebellion

01:34.959 --> 01:36.264
so I wouldn't use it against Him.

01:36.266 --> 01:37.762
Father <i>said</i> He destroyed it.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.499
Apparently, He just
hid it in plain sight.

01:40.535 --> 01:44.770
But it's so small and so... not flaming.

01:44.806 --> 01:49.274
That's because only
you, my Lightbringer,

01:49.310 --> 01:50.933
can ignite it.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.269
Well, what am I supposed to do,

01:52.272 --> 01:54.281
dip it in some whiskey
and light a match?

01:54.284 --> 01:57.316
Last time it caught
flame, you were angry,

01:57.319 --> 02:00.318
so think about your
Father, that should do it.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.189
All right. (clears throat)

02:04.158 --> 02:05.392
(exhales)

02:07.261 --> 02:08.860
(strains): No!

02:08.895 --> 02:10.562
Right, back to my whiskey plan.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.264
No, you're much too calm.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.499
When it flamed before, you were furious.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.748
So you're saying the blade
can sense my emotional state?

02:17.751 --> 02:19.049
It's the most powerful weapon

02:19.052 --> 02:20.182
in the universe, Mum...

02:20.185 --> 02:23.074
The sword that guarded
Eden, not a groovy mood ring.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.186
Maybe I should try it.

02:24.189 --> 02:26.466
Your brother is the
Lightbringer, Amenadiel.

02:26.481 --> 02:29.314
He just needs to apply
himself and get angry!

02:29.350 --> 02:31.685
Well, I can't just get ang... Aah!

02:32.412 --> 02:34.152
Bloody hell!

02:34.155 --> 02:35.987
Well, it was worth a shot.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.500
Right. Maybe Amenadiel should try it.

02:38.503 --> 02:41.576
Here, why don't you hold it,
and I'll kick you in the...

02:41.579 --> 02:43.395
Boys!

02:43.431 --> 02:46.364
We need to work together on this.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.733
We're so close now.

02:47.769 --> 02:49.167
Are we, Mom?

02:49.203 --> 02:50.869
Because our return home hinges

02:50.905 --> 02:53.972
on Lucifer being able
to control his emotions.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.974
Oh, you've no faith
in me, brother? Good.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.143
Means I get to prove you wrong.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.910
(scoffs)

03:04.719 --> 03:09.121
So the three of you plan
to use this... Flaming Sword

03:09.157 --> 03:11.590
to cut through the Gates of Heaven

03:11.626 --> 03:12.858
and go home?

03:12.894 --> 03:14.526
That's the plan, yes.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.928
Do you mean actual gates?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.463
Like big and pearly?

03:18.499 --> 03:19.931
Are we talking clouds?

03:19.967 --> 03:22.569
Harps? Old dudes in white robes?

03:22.572 --> 03:24.103
And my dad is Morgan Freeman?

03:24.105 --> 03:26.705
Focus, Doctor. Now, come on.

03:26.741 --> 03:29.841
I need you to help me
control my emotions.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.710
Well, emotions can't
be controlled, Lucifer.

03:31.746 --> 03:34.214
What? Isn't that your entire job?

03:34.217 --> 03:38.070
My job is to help you
understand your emotions.

03:38.073 --> 03:40.999
I can help you become aware
of what it is you're feeling,

03:41.002 --> 03:44.858
or trying to <i>avoid</i> feeling.

03:48.070 --> 03:49.889
Right, you've got that look on your face

03:49.897 --> 03:51.330
when you're saying something insightful

03:51.332 --> 03:53.131
and waiting for me to figure it out.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.369
I think you married
her to hide something.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.571
- Or <i>from</i> something.
- Right, look,

03:59.607 --> 04:02.507
what I may or may not be hiding
is beside the point, Doctor.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.509
Either way, I need the sword lit.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.512
So, come on. Emotions. Chop, chop.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.268
You clearly have a lot
of walls up, Lucifer.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.982
Between yourself and your emotions,

04:11.018 --> 04:13.451
and now between yourself and me.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.225
If you're unwilling to
bring those walls down,

04:16.228 --> 04:17.591
I can't help you.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.926
(sighs)

04:20.962 --> 04:23.196
(rock music playing)

04:26.500 --> 04:28.433
(rock music playing through
Maze's earbuds stops)

04:28.469 --> 04:29.968
What the hell, Decker?

04:30.004 --> 04:31.236
No breakfast?

04:31.272 --> 04:34.206
Oh, I forgot. Sorry.

04:34.242 --> 04:35.307
You forgot?

04:35.343 --> 04:37.344
Chloe Decker forgot?

04:38.646 --> 04:40.612
Are you okay?

04:40.648 --> 04:42.647
What did you do with my roommate?

04:42.683 --> 04:45.317
She would never ask about my feelings.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.952
(laughs): Oh, feelings?

04:46.988 --> 04:49.321
No, I was thinking brain tumor,

04:49.357 --> 04:52.759
early-onset dementia, chlamydia.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.396
Uh, well, yeah.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.332
I guess I'm still a little upset

05:00.368 --> 05:03.134
that Lucifer just disappeared on me

05:03.170 --> 05:05.537
and got married just when we were...

05:05.573 --> 05:07.672
(sighs) You know, I
don't know what we were.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.908
(rock music playing
loudly through earbuds)

05:09.944 --> 05:12.978
And sure, he got it annulled
right away, but, you know,

05:13.014 --> 05:14.512
that almost makes it worse.

05:14.548 --> 05:18.083
(rock music continues through earbuds)

05:18.119 --> 05:20.051
Focus on Trixie.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.020
And I'm-I'm worried about her.

05:22.056 --> 05:23.521

05:37.071 --> 05:39.104

deal with human emotions

05:42.944 --> 05:44.776
on an empty stomach.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.178
Makes me...

05:47.214 --> 05:49.014
nauseous.

05:49.050 --> 05:52.218
Of course. What did I expect?

Tall, non-fat almond milk latte

06:06.500 --> 06:09.401
with sugar-free caramel
drizzle and no vodka this time.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.769
What's the occasion?

06:10.805 --> 06:13.005
Well, I thought we should
celebrate our first day together

06:13.007 --> 06:14.706
as crime-solving divorcees.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.907
(laughs)

06:15.943 --> 06:17.848
Ah, making a joke you don't like. Check.

06:17.851 --> 06:19.577
See? We'll be back to normal in no time.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.747
Uh, not until you start whining
about how boring the case is.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.183
(chuckles) Well, touché, Detective.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.819
Our victim's name is Debbie Lang.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.121
She worked as the head of
administrations of a very

06:30.157 --> 06:32.857
prestigious elementary school
on the Westside called...

06:32.893 --> 06:34.756
called Starford.

06:34.759 --> 06:37.158
How could a career in
education pay for all this?

06:37.161 --> 06:39.416
L.A. private schools are insane.

06:39.419 --> 06:41.132
You know, money gets thrown around.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.500
What do we have?

06:42.536 --> 06:44.803
Well, poor Debbie was
stabbed in the back,

06:44.839 --> 06:45.937
literally.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.133
DAN: Maybe figuratively, too.

06:47.141 --> 06:48.306
There was no signs of B&E,

06:48.342 --> 06:50.179
which suggests she
knew who her killer was.

06:50.182 --> 06:52.577
- Anyone recover the murder weapon?
- No, not yet.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.601
ELLA: You'd think knife,
but the circumference

06:55.604 --> 06:57.348
of the wound is unusually wide,

06:57.351 --> 06:59.601
like it was a... fat knife.

06:59.604 --> 07:01.398
LUCIFER: PhD in psychology,

07:01.401 --> 07:03.390
certificate for behavioral therapy.

07:03.393 --> 07:04.823
I should have thought
this woman had figured out

07:04.825 --> 07:06.425
human interaction, yet
she provoked someone

07:06.427 --> 07:07.692
into killing her?

07:07.728 --> 07:10.270
Therapists don't really
know anything, do they?

07:10.273 --> 07:13.028
Ooh, Lucifer's projecting his
personal issues on the case.

07:13.031 --> 07:14.424
Guess we're back to normal.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.700
- (chuckles)
- ELLA: Ah, man.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.036
I got into it with my
shrink a couple of weeks ago.

07:18.072 --> 07:19.926
What? You see a psychologist?

07:19.929 --> 07:22.145
I know. You wouldn't think so, right?

07:22.148 --> 07:24.414
'Cause I'm so upbeat all the time.

07:24.417 --> 07:27.379
But up here... lot of darkness.

07:27.415 --> 07:29.609
- Really?
- CHLOE: Hey, guys?

07:29.612 --> 07:31.159
What's this?

07:35.890 --> 07:37.288
(Lucifer laughs)

07:37.324 --> 07:39.624
Well, where do I start?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.693
ELLA: Missing commemorative scissors.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.925
Looks like we found our fat knife.

07:43.928 --> 07:45.227
Or didn't find it,

07:45.230 --> 07:46.355
but, you know.

07:46.358 --> 07:48.166
So, weapon of convenience.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.317
Could have been a crime of passion.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.552
Vic knew the killer,

07:51.555 --> 07:53.789
so we should go to the
school where she worked.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.346
I, uh... I just can't believe it.

08:01.382 --> 08:03.513
You know, Debbie was the best

08:03.516 --> 08:05.081
head of admissions we've ever had,

08:05.084 --> 08:08.386
the heart and soul of
the Starford community.

08:08.422 --> 08:10.652
We're all devastated.

08:10.655 --> 08:12.621
Is there any way we could see her office

08:12.657 --> 08:14.790
or the last few things
she was working on?

08:14.826 --> 08:15.591
Sure.

08:15.627 --> 08:17.426
No phones on campus, please.

08:17.462 --> 08:18.761
Sends a message

08:18.797 --> 08:21.369
that our arms aren't actually
available to our children.

08:21.372 --> 08:23.171
Right. Detective, this school is weird,

08:23.174 --> 08:25.040
and, yes, this case is boring.

08:25.043 --> 08:26.309
Not weird.

08:26.312 --> 08:27.542
Unique.

08:27.545 --> 08:29.869
Our groundbreaking pedagogical approach

08:29.905 --> 08:32.636
focuses on emotional self-control.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.578
Emotional self-control?
How'd you go about that, then?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.010
Lucifer, can you go back to being bored,

08:37.011 --> 08:38.378
and not derail the conversation?

08:38.414 --> 08:40.246
No, no, but this is fascinating,
Detective. The so-called expert

08:40.249 --> 08:43.216
I just consulted insisted
emotions can't be controlled.

08:43.219 --> 08:44.551
Well, we respectfully disagree.

08:44.554 --> 08:47.987
Um, our children learn to
manage their emotions in no time.

08:48.023 --> 08:51.059
Well, why didn't you say
so in the first place?

08:52.595 --> 08:54.193
Let the schooling begin!

08:54.229 --> 08:55.885

09:12.582 --> 09:14.350
- "I feel, therefore I am."
- Hmm.

09:14.386 --> 09:15.385
Fascinating.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.086
Let's just stick to the case.

09:17.122 --> 09:18.254
Hold on, Detective.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.015
Debbie isn't going to un-die, is she?

09:20.018 --> 09:22.425
Whereas I require immediate assistance.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.761
Look, yes, how long
does it take for rug rats

09:24.797 --> 09:26.279
to gain emotional self-control?

09:26.282 --> 09:27.597
MURRAY: Oh, our methods
work very quickly.

09:27.599 --> 09:28.931
The parents see it for themselves

09:28.967 --> 09:30.696
after sitting in on just one class.

09:30.699 --> 09:33.302
Notice all the, um, testimonials.

09:33.338 --> 09:35.004
Yes.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.239
So, Debbie.

09:36.275 --> 09:39.008
Did she have any enemies
here at work that you know of?

09:39.044 --> 09:41.611
You see, our faculty practices the same

09:41.647 --> 09:44.247
conflict-resolution
method as our children.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.749
People in a conflict actually

09:46.785 --> 09:48.384
present handmade gifts to one another.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.820
This was Debbie's desk,

09:50.856 --> 09:54.022
and, as you can see,
not a single macramé.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.093
What about outside the faculty?

09:57.129 --> 09:59.829
Any recent incidents with parents maybe?

09:59.865 --> 10:01.515
Nothing like that would
ever happen Starford.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.633
Oh, weird, 'cause heads of admissions

10:03.669 --> 10:05.668
at other prestigious private schools

10:05.704 --> 10:08.704
are practically stalked
by eager parents, so,

10:08.740 --> 10:11.007
maybe the spots here at
Starford just aren't as coveted.

10:11.043 --> 10:11.808
(laughs): Not so.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.109
No, parents go above and beyond

10:13.145 --> 10:14.844
to get their children here at Starford.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.725
And they go absolutely crazy
when they fail to land a spot.

10:17.728 --> 10:19.784
Just the other day...

10:23.889 --> 10:26.823
Well, perhaps there was one incident.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.958
Debbie did get into a rather

10:28.994 --> 10:31.294
ugly fight with the parents of a child

10:31.330 --> 10:33.100
who'd been denied admission.

10:33.103 --> 10:34.564
- It got vicious.
- LUCIFER: Ooh.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.532
Fisticuffs? Beat-down at the bike sheds

10:36.568 --> 10:37.767
after the final bell?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.802
No, <i>verbally</i> vicious.

10:39.838 --> 10:41.404
- Ah, terrible grammar.
- Mmhmm.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.506
Got you.

10:43.986 --> 10:45.618
Did you see the fight?

10:45.621 --> 10:46.727
Everyone saw it.

10:46.730 --> 10:47.830
It happened right in
front of the school,

10:47.832 --> 10:49.478
violating what we like to think of as

10:49.481 --> 10:51.447
our safe space here at Starford.

10:51.483 --> 10:53.082
What was said?

10:53.118 --> 10:55.586
I will kill you.

10:57.103 --> 10:58.967
That is what I said, yes.

10:58.970 --> 11:00.656
But you have to understand.

11:00.692 --> 11:03.626
I was furious that she'd
rejected our son, Wolfe.

11:03.662 --> 11:05.995
If you have children,
I'm sure you can relate.

11:06.031 --> 11:07.563
A Starford education

11:07.599 --> 11:09.765
feeds almost directly to the Ivy League.

11:09.801 --> 11:13.198
Debbie took our money and
crushed our son's future.

11:13.201 --> 11:14.639
What do you mean? What money?

11:14.642 --> 11:17.549
Well, she implied that a hefty
contribution to the school

11:17.552 --> 11:19.685
would grease the wheels
on Wolfe's admission.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.454
So you made the contribution
and Wolfe was still rejected?

11:22.490 --> 11:23.588
Yes.

11:23.624 --> 11:25.590
We felt we'd been... misled.

11:25.626 --> 11:26.892
More like robbed.

11:26.928 --> 11:28.553
And then, when we tried

11:28.556 --> 11:31.062
to bring it up to
Debbie, she had the gall

11:31.065 --> 11:33.465
to suggest that the school
hadn't received the donation.

11:33.501 --> 11:35.167
But the check cleared!

11:35.203 --> 11:36.169
Lying...

11:37.438 --> 11:39.339
(clears throat)

11:41.843 --> 11:43.775
JON: I know my husband's temper

11:43.811 --> 11:45.977
suggests otherwise, but
we're dealing with this

11:46.013 --> 11:48.847
the civilized way... Through our lawyer.

11:48.883 --> 11:51.717
We could never kill anyone.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.552
Then can you explain
why the murder weapon

11:53.588 --> 11:55.155
was found in your pool house?

11:57.658 --> 11:59.726
♪

12:03.431 --> 12:06.631
♪ We're fireworks ♪

12:06.667 --> 12:10.602
♪ We shoot so high ♪

12:10.638 --> 12:14.840
♪ But tell me what
becomes of the rising sun ♪

12:14.876 --> 12:17.509
♪ That burns before it shines ♪

12:17.545 --> 12:21.580
♪ Now, the same thing
happens every time... ♪

12:21.616 --> 12:24.049
Are you Lucifer Morningstar?

12:24.085 --> 12:25.283
I am, yes.

12:25.319 --> 12:26.585
But sadly, I don't have the time

12:26.587 --> 12:28.454
to give you the most
amazing night of your life.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.989
I'm busy dealing with
this impenetrable book.

12:31.025 --> 12:32.924
Mr. Morningstar, you're under arrest.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.059
(laughs)

12:34.095 --> 12:35.427
I am now, am I?

12:35.463 --> 12:37.095
- On what charge?
- Ladies,

12:37.131 --> 12:38.997
he's resisting arrest.

12:39.033 --> 12:40.132
Cuff him.

12:40.168 --> 12:41.733
My pleasure.

12:41.769 --> 12:43.535
Right, why do you sexy detectives

12:43.571 --> 12:45.839
look so disturbingly familiar?

12:48.609 --> 12:50.275
Mum!

12:50.311 --> 12:51.877
Mum, come on.

12:51.913 --> 12:54.648
Come on out from
wherever you're snooping.

12:56.559 --> 12:57.985
- What?
- Ah.

12:57.988 --> 13:00.286
I tried to find ones that
resemble your detective.

13:00.288 --> 13:02.621
Then again, all humans look alike to me.

13:02.626 --> 13:05.098
No, you did, um, well, remarkably well.

13:05.101 --> 13:06.600
But what on Earth for?

13:06.603 --> 13:08.894
Since anger didn't
work, I wanted to incite

13:08.930 --> 13:10.829
a different emotion.

13:10.865 --> 13:12.998
See if that would get
the sword fired up.

13:13.034 --> 13:15.702
A foursome isn't an emotion, Mum.

13:16.771 --> 13:17.969
Ladies, I'm sorry, but, uh,

13:18.005 --> 13:19.805
it's hard for me to
enjoy a triple-decker

13:19.841 --> 13:22.142
with my mum's hands all over it, so...

13:23.744 --> 13:26.980
Another time, maybe. Shame.

13:28.249 --> 13:30.782
(clears throat)

13:30.818 --> 13:32.017
Don't look so glum.

13:32.053 --> 13:33.852
It's just a matter of time before I get

13:33.888 --> 13:36.121
a handle on my emotions.

13:36.157 --> 13:37.923
I know it's a matter of time.

13:37.959 --> 13:39.958
- That's the problem.
- What's the rush?

13:39.994 --> 13:42.896
Not like eternity's got
a "best before" date.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.932
You'd understand if you had children.

13:46.968 --> 13:48.742
Many of which you haven't
seen in a millennia.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.701
Yes.

13:49.737 --> 13:51.705
That's it, Mum. You're right.

13:52.473 --> 13:54.739
I need to have a child.

13:54.775 --> 13:56.708
Right, have a gander at that.

13:56.744 --> 13:58.778
See if you can learn a few things.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.085
Mm-hmm.

14:07.121 --> 14:10.188
Right, well, it seemed like
something wasn't adding up.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.931
Yeah, okay.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.801
Thanks, Ella.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.295
(gasps) Okay.

14:17.331 --> 14:19.297
(exhales)

14:19.333 --> 14:22.267
I am gonna tie a bell around
your neck at some point.

14:22.303 --> 14:24.269
Oh, sounds like a fun bit of foreplay,

14:24.305 --> 14:26.105
but I've more important
things to attend to first.

14:26.107 --> 14:27.672
Yeah, I'm sure you do, but hold on.

14:27.708 --> 14:29.040
Something's bothering me.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.976
The killer wiped the
fingerprints off the handle,

14:30.978 --> 14:32.611
but not Debbie's blood from the blade.

14:32.647 --> 14:34.946
But the scissors were found
at their home, correct?

14:34.982 --> 14:36.821
In the unlocked pool house,

14:36.824 --> 14:38.589
so anyone could have
gained access to it.

14:38.592 --> 14:40.493
So you think the killer
planted the murder weapon

14:40.495 --> 14:42.494
on the couple last seen
fighting with the victim.

14:42.497 --> 14:43.695
That's admirably devious.

14:43.698 --> 14:45.798
Jon and Craig said that
their check cleared.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.082
But Debbie told them the school
never received their money.

14:48.084 --> 14:50.210
- So she's lying.
- But what if she wasn't lying?

14:50.213 --> 14:52.081
What if somebody embezzled
the money at the school?

14:52.083 --> 14:53.884
Debbie could have found out,
she could have confronted them.

14:53.886 --> 14:55.085
They could be the killer.

14:55.088 --> 14:57.120
So, you know, what we got
to do... check the books,

14:57.123 --> 14:58.722
see if there's a record of a donation.

14:58.742 --> 14:59.815
LUCIFER: Right.

14:59.818 --> 15:01.739
Baby, why are you still in your PJs?

15:01.742 --> 15:02.941
You're gonna miss the bus.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.695
I don't have time to
drive you to school today.

15:04.697 --> 15:05.462
Hold on.

15:05.498 --> 15:07.030
Why don't you go and deal

15:07.066 --> 15:08.632
with the donation thingy,

15:08.668 --> 15:12.535
and I can, uh, take the little
sh... ugar plum fairy to school.

15:12.571 --> 15:14.080
Are you sure?

15:14.083 --> 15:17.140
For my partner? Yes, I can sacrifice.

15:17.176 --> 15:19.142
You okay with that?

15:19.178 --> 15:21.711
Brilliant.

15:21.747 --> 15:24.080
♪ Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah ♪

15:24.116 --> 15:26.449

15:32.725 --> 15:35.225
What? I said I'd drive you to school.

15:35.261 --> 15:36.893
I never specified which one.

15:36.921 --> 15:39.396
So, play along, and I'll
deliver my end of the bargain.

15:39.407 --> 15:40.689
- Mr. Morningstar?
- Yes.

15:40.692 --> 15:42.265
- Hey. Mr. Taylor.
- Ah.

15:42.301 --> 15:43.334
You're here for the Starford tour?

15:43.336 --> 15:44.834
I am indeed. I am indeed.

15:44.870 --> 15:48.104
And this little creature,
who gets whatever she wants...

15:48.140 --> 15:51.508
Trixie Morningstar.
Nice to meet you, sir.

15:51.544 --> 15:52.995
Hi. (chuckles)

15:53.779 --> 15:55.450
Ah, lovely.

15:57.396 --> 16:00.730
So, right upstairs there
is our plant-based kitchen.

16:00.766 --> 16:02.765
Uh, it's where the students
make their own lunch.

16:02.801 --> 16:04.926
You know, instead of
packaged, preprocessed foods,

16:04.929 --> 16:06.628
we, uh, we like them to bring in, uh...

16:06.631 --> 16:08.098
(quietly): Sorry, do we have to touch?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.134
Don't you have a leash or
something for when we go out?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.241
Do you want to sell this or not?

16:12.277 --> 16:14.177
- It's a lot of fun...
- Yes, that's all quite riveting.

16:14.179 --> 16:15.845
Um, where is it where children learn to,

16:15.881 --> 16:17.613
you know, harness their emotions?

16:17.649 --> 16:19.923
Uh... uh...

16:19.926 --> 16:21.184
(sighs) Hold on.

16:21.220 --> 16:23.236
Uh, sorry, this isn't my normal job.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.754
I'm just filling in till we find
a replacement for poor Debbie.

16:25.757 --> 16:27.723
Oh, well, what is it you normally do?

16:27.759 --> 16:30.760
Uh, I'm the movement
and wellness mentor.

16:30.796 --> 16:33.130
So you're the P.E. teacher. Lovely.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.999
Okay, well, right here, this is

16:37.035 --> 16:38.734
the, uh, meditation room.

16:38.770 --> 16:40.303
Um, and then, right next door is, uh,

16:40.339 --> 16:42.038
it's where the kids do
their justice circles.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.006
I need you to show me
where they teach lessons

16:44.042 --> 16:45.977
on controlling your emotions.

16:47.045 --> 16:48.511
TAYLOR: Oh.

16:48.547 --> 16:51.113
She's having emotional problems?

16:51.149 --> 16:52.315
Who?

16:52.351 --> 16:53.449
Oh, the child.

16:53.485 --> 16:54.951
Sure. Probably.

16:54.987 --> 16:56.719
Listen, what would be really helpful is

16:56.755 --> 16:59.924
turning feelings into
something, like a weapon.

17:01.267 --> 17:03.593
Well, I think I know just the class.

17:03.629 --> 17:05.428
You do? Wonderful.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.363
Great.

17:07.398 --> 17:08.898
Come on, child.

17:10.202 --> 17:15.711
And you want to look
through our ledgers... why?

17:15.714 --> 17:17.906
Because we want to know if
Debbie was telling the truth

17:17.909 --> 17:19.175
about the missing donation,

17:19.211 --> 17:22.211
and it could tie into
the motive for the murder.

17:22.247 --> 17:24.380
(sobs)

17:24.415 --> 17:26.098
I knew it.

17:26.852 --> 17:28.451
(sobbing): You got me.

17:28.487 --> 17:31.220
No need to look at the books. I did it.

17:31.256 --> 17:34.690
The donation never made
it into the school account.

17:34.726 --> 17:36.459
I cashed the check.

17:36.495 --> 17:37.727
You stole the money?

17:37.763 --> 17:39.295
- Why?
- I guess I was

17:39.331 --> 17:42.031
tired of feeling like I didn't belong.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.833
Starford seemed so

17:43.869 --> 17:45.935
nonjudgmental and inclusive.

17:45.971 --> 17:48.037
But I'm-I'm under a lot of pressure

17:48.073 --> 17:49.305
to look a certain way,

17:49.341 --> 17:51.907
drive a certain car.

17:51.943 --> 17:54.609
And my salary barely covers my rent.

17:54.612 --> 17:57.480
Okay, so Debbie found out that you took

17:57.516 --> 17:59.393
Jon and Craig's donation money

17:59.396 --> 18:01.584
and... did you kill her?

18:01.620 --> 18:04.420
What? No, no.

18:04.456 --> 18:09.125
Debbie assumed the parents
never extended the check.

18:09.161 --> 18:10.559
They called her a liar,

18:10.595 --> 18:14.363
got so upset, and they killed her.

18:14.399 --> 18:16.766
But I'm to blame.

18:16.802 --> 18:18.868
I'm sorry.

18:18.904 --> 18:20.136
DAN: Look, we're not

18:20.172 --> 18:24.607
real sure if Jon and
Craig killed Debbie.

18:24.643 --> 18:26.131
Really?

18:29.481 --> 18:30.846
(sniffles)

18:30.882 --> 18:32.081
Oh.

18:32.117 --> 18:35.584
If it's not related to
the murders, after all, um,

18:35.620 --> 18:40.122
perhaps we could disregard...

18:40.158 --> 18:41.691
that last exchange.

18:41.727 --> 18:43.926
Uh, is everything okay in here?

18:43.962 --> 18:45.699
Sounded like a child was crying.

18:45.738 --> 18:49.065
We're just asking the
assistant dean some questions.

18:49.101 --> 18:50.941
Uh, I am Detective Decker.
This is Detective...

18:50.969 --> 18:53.002
Oh, you're Trixie's
cop-mom, aren't you?

18:53.038 --> 18:54.704
That's a great kid you've got.

18:54.740 --> 18:56.706
Thank you. H-How do you know...

18:56.742 --> 18:58.007
How do you know my daughter?

18:58.043 --> 18:59.475
She's in Madison's class right now.

18:59.478 --> 19:01.092
Yeah, her father brought her in.

19:01.095 --> 19:04.180
Um... I'm pretty sure he didn't.

19:04.216 --> 19:08.150
Uh, can you finish getting
the statement, please,

19:08.186 --> 19:10.252
and I'll see whatever
the hell Lucifer is doing.

19:10.288 --> 19:13.589
But the good news is bad feelings can be

19:13.625 --> 19:15.858
harnessed into good actions.

19:15.894 --> 19:18.896
My son Ranger knows this. Right, Ranger?

19:22.734 --> 19:24.613
Would anyone else like to try?

19:24.616 --> 19:25.581
Yeah.

19:25.584 --> 19:28.237
Would any of the <i>children</i>
like to volunteer?

19:28.240 --> 19:29.505
(Lucifer sighs)

19:29.541 --> 19:33.043
For a progressive school,
it's rather ageist.

19:34.379 --> 19:35.745
Trixie.

19:35.781 --> 19:37.340
Do you have feelings you want to use?

19:37.343 --> 19:39.081
I know it's only your first time, but...

19:39.117 --> 19:41.447
I feel sad.

19:41.450 --> 19:43.719
- Okay, why?
- Because...

19:43.755 --> 19:46.178
my mommy almost died.

19:46.194 --> 19:48.691
Her job is scary.

19:48.727 --> 19:50.593
But she has helped so many other people

19:50.629 --> 19:52.128
with their problems,

19:52.164 --> 19:55.065
I don't want her to worry about mine.

19:56.067 --> 19:58.746
So I pretend I'm okay.

19:58.785 --> 20:00.269
Well...

20:00.305 --> 20:03.606
welcome to the club of
parental deceit, child.

20:03.642 --> 20:04.907
It's a lonely place,

20:04.943 --> 20:07.678
but, uh, that's the
price of being clever.

20:10.348 --> 20:11.614
Okay, now what?

20:11.650 --> 20:14.750
How does one control that
juvenile angst usefully?

20:14.786 --> 20:18.421
Trixie can channel her strong feelings

20:18.457 --> 20:20.322
into something productive.

20:20.358 --> 20:22.358
Okay, go on.

20:22.394 --> 20:25.194
For example, she could...

20:25.230 --> 20:26.328
write a poem.

20:26.364 --> 20:27.430
A poem?

20:27.466 --> 20:28.731
I came here to learn how

20:28.767 --> 20:31.461
to turn emotions into energy,
not to become Dr. Seuss.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.769
Well, creative energy is energy.

20:33.805 --> 20:35.938
Oh, come on. If I wanted
to attend an art class,

20:35.974 --> 20:37.606
I would have at least had the sense

20:37.642 --> 20:38.908
to take one with a nude model.

20:38.944 --> 20:41.661
I suppose you're
channeling emotional despair

20:41.664 --> 20:44.330
over not getting dessert
before your veggies, are you?

20:44.333 --> 20:48.018
No. This is a picture of
my mommy stabbing Debbie.

20:51.122 --> 20:52.623
Lucifer.

20:54.259 --> 20:55.791
Detective.

20:55.827 --> 20:57.159
Right, before you chastise me

20:57.195 --> 20:58.861
for kidnapping your offspring,

20:58.897 --> 21:01.665
I've solved the case.

21:03.201 --> 21:05.701
Okay, the boy's mother is Joy Sherman.

21:05.737 --> 21:07.436
This is her contact info.

21:07.472 --> 21:09.071
Okay, I'll look into it.

21:09.107 --> 21:10.137
Is Trixie okay?

21:10.140 --> 21:11.774
I'll talk to her.

21:11.810 --> 21:13.909
I'll see you at the station, okay?

21:13.945 --> 21:15.746
Yeah.

21:19.084 --> 21:20.115
Ah, Detective.

21:20.151 --> 21:21.851
You need to understand, I'm dealing with

21:21.887 --> 21:23.252
a most challenging issue...

21:23.288 --> 21:25.654
Yeah, I want to talk to
my daughter for a second.

21:25.690 --> 21:26.856
Please don't be mad at him.

21:26.892 --> 21:28.557
I should be the one in trouble.

21:28.593 --> 21:31.627
Oh... I'm not mad at you.

21:31.663 --> 21:33.195
You're not in trouble, Monkey.

21:33.231 --> 21:34.864
I do want you to know

21:34.900 --> 21:38.067
you can talk to me if
something's going on.

21:38.103 --> 21:39.068
I know.

21:39.104 --> 21:40.069
You know that?

21:40.105 --> 21:42.471
You want to talk about something now?

21:42.507 --> 21:44.940
I could tell you anything?

21:44.976 --> 21:46.577
Yes.

21:48.313 --> 21:50.112
I'd like to ride with Lucifer.

21:50.148 --> 21:52.014
I promise I'll make him take me

21:52.050 --> 21:54.618
to my actual school this time.

21:56.288 --> 21:58.254
Huh.

21:58.290 --> 22:00.891
Um, yeah, okay.

22:03.328 --> 22:06.595
You are lucky my daughter
likes you so much.

22:06.631 --> 22:09.798
Yes, I'm starting to respect
the deceptive little parasite.

22:09.801 --> 22:11.719
- (chuckles)
- Oh, well, that's nice.

22:11.722 --> 22:13.969
Speaking of, a deal's a deal.

22:14.005 --> 22:15.039
What?

22:17.406 --> 22:19.107
CHLOE: Oh, no.

22:20.779 --> 22:22.144
I... (sighs)

22:22.180 --> 22:24.402
Driving lessons will have to wait

22:24.405 --> 22:26.304
until your mum's not looking.

22:26.307 --> 22:28.672
- CHLOE: Bye, babe.
- (engine starts)

22:33.670 --> 22:35.537
(sighs): Oh, kids.

22:38.459 --> 22:39.458
Ah.

22:39.509 --> 22:42.240
Wonderful, a mugger. (chuckles)

22:42.299 --> 22:44.255
Come on, then. I fancy a bit of exercise

22:44.258 --> 22:45.392
after a frustrating day.

22:53.158 --> 22:55.196
(shouts)

23:02.871 --> 23:05.104
Mum?

23:05.140 --> 23:07.941
Let me see the blade. Anything?

23:07.977 --> 23:10.476
Since when can you hit so hard?

23:10.512 --> 23:12.761
My strength has been growing steadily.

23:12.764 --> 23:14.681
As is your recklessness, it seems.

23:14.683 --> 23:16.549
I mean, what did you expect me to do?

23:16.552 --> 23:19.212
Stab you with the blade and
have it be ignited by my joy?

23:19.215 --> 23:21.287
I was trying to get you worked up.

23:21.323 --> 23:22.555
Anger and awakening

23:22.591 --> 23:24.824
your sexual instincts didn't work.

23:24.827 --> 23:28.227
I thought maybe if you
were afraid for your life...

23:28.230 --> 23:29.863
Well, if you really wanted to upset me,

23:29.865 --> 23:31.931
you should have just
thrown me into the Corvette.

23:31.967 --> 23:33.166
Don't...

23:33.202 --> 23:35.835
throw me into the Corvette.

23:35.871 --> 23:38.771
Just trust me, Mum.
I'm dealing with this.

23:38.807 --> 23:40.773
Clearly, not fast enough.

23:40.809 --> 23:42.075
Why are you so angry?

23:42.111 --> 23:43.242
I'm not angry!

23:43.278 --> 23:44.676
Yes, you are.

23:44.679 --> 23:45.744
Just...

23:45.747 --> 23:48.982
really need to get
home, where we belong.

23:49.018 --> 23:50.284
Soon.

23:55.491 --> 23:58.391
Hey, Chlo, we got that
kid's mom in inter...

23:58.427 --> 24:00.860
What's wrong?

24:00.896 --> 24:03.228
Look at this e-mail.

24:03.231 --> 24:05.299
Why are you being invited
to a "grieving gathering"

24:05.302 --> 24:06.361
at Starford Academy?

24:06.364 --> 24:08.402
'Cause Trixie's being
considered for admission.

24:08.404 --> 24:10.503
Apparently, she impressed
some of the teachers there.

24:10.539 --> 24:12.572
Or they were impressed
with Lucifer's bank account.

24:12.575 --> 24:14.440
It's probably the only
thing they care about

24:14.443 --> 24:15.542
at that pretentious place.

24:15.545 --> 24:16.242
Well, I mean,

24:16.278 --> 24:18.044
it is non-traditional, that's for sure.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.901
Wait, are you actually considering it?

24:19.904 --> 24:21.681
I mean, don't you
think that with the divorce

24:21.717 --> 24:23.517
and the move and everything
that Trixie's had enough

24:23.519 --> 24:25.018
- big changes lately?
- Exactly.

24:25.054 --> 24:27.020
Trixie's pretending
that she's fine, Dan.

24:27.056 --> 24:30.839
One morning at Starford,
and she's been opening up

24:30.842 --> 24:33.844
like I haven't been able
to get her to do for months.

24:34.530 --> 24:36.462
- You didn't see her.
- Yeah, well,

24:36.498 --> 24:38.231
it kills me to think that she, uh,

24:38.267 --> 24:40.266
she's been keeping up an
act just to protect us.

24:40.302 --> 24:42.423
When did our kid get so adult?

24:42.426 --> 24:44.826
She does still hide chocolate
cake under the bed, though.

24:44.829 --> 24:46.273
Yeah, well, thank God for that.

24:46.275 --> 24:47.674
Okay, well,

24:47.710 --> 24:49.876
maybe we can consider sending
our daughter to that school

24:49.878 --> 24:52.714
after we've solved the ongoing
murder investigation there.

24:54.112 --> 24:56.045
DAN: Can you explain to us why

24:56.048 --> 24:58.084
your son would draw this, Ms. Sherman?

24:58.120 --> 25:01.354
I'm not sure what it even is.

25:01.390 --> 25:03.489
He says it's you killing Debbie.

25:03.525 --> 25:06.426
Oh, he was listening to me. (chuckles)

25:06.462 --> 25:08.995
He never listens to me.

25:09.031 --> 25:10.596
So you said that you killed Debbie?

25:10.599 --> 25:14.067
No, I-I said I wanted to kill her.

25:14.103 --> 25:16.335
Every morning, while
peeling the sticker off

25:16.371 --> 25:18.571
some root vegetable I
got at the supermarket

25:18.607 --> 25:20.440
for a third of the price
of the organic crap.

25:20.476 --> 25:22.742
Rubbing it in dirt works
like a charm, by the way.

25:22.778 --> 25:23.611
Hmm.

25:23.614 --> 25:25.078
Why would you say that to him?

25:25.080 --> 25:28.347
Because I'm single
and I work full-time,

25:28.374 --> 25:30.279
and Debbie had a million little ways

25:30.291 --> 25:32.824
of making me feel like
a bad mom because of it.

25:32.827 --> 25:34.520
- For working?
- Yeah.

25:34.523 --> 25:38.257
Well, that sounds like
a great environment.

25:38.293 --> 25:40.901
Apparently, I wasn't "involved enough."

25:40.904 --> 25:43.004
Like, I'm sorry that
my bake sale cupcakes

25:43.007 --> 25:45.540
weren't gluten and dairy free, Debbie.

25:45.543 --> 25:47.346
Joy, where were you two nights ago?

25:47.382 --> 25:50.149
Tuesday?

25:50.185 --> 25:51.452
Mm-hmm.

25:52.332 --> 25:55.533
Um, I was, I was with Mr. Taylor.

25:55.536 --> 25:56.634
CHLOE: Mr. Taylor?

25:56.637 --> 25:59.591
The wellness mentor?
What were you doing?

25:59.627 --> 26:02.361
We weren't discussing
the French New Wave.

26:02.397 --> 26:03.929
DAN: So you're having an affair

26:03.965 --> 26:05.331
with the...

26:05.367 --> 26:06.699
with the P.E. teacher.

26:06.735 --> 26:08.968
JOY: Only on Tuesday nights.

26:09.004 --> 26:11.038
He had a busy schedule.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.440
Look, every mom at Starford knows

26:14.476 --> 26:15.842
that the movement and wellness program

26:15.844 --> 26:17.943
is one of the best
benefits of the school.

26:17.979 --> 26:21.647
I mean, the man is as
dumb as a box of hair,

26:21.683 --> 26:25.584
but he does know how to move.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.376
CHLOE: While I check
into your alibi, uh,

26:27.379 --> 26:29.178
can you tell us, are
there any other people

26:29.181 --> 26:31.657
that you can think of that
had a grudge against Debbie?

26:31.659 --> 26:33.125
Are you, are you kidding?

26:33.161 --> 26:35.594
Who didn't hate the Wicked
Witch of the Westside?

26:35.630 --> 26:38.397
She held the keys to the most
exclusive school in the city,

26:38.433 --> 26:40.566
and she never let anyone forget it.

26:40.602 --> 26:42.935
We were told that she
was very well loved.

26:42.971 --> 26:44.069
(laughs)

26:44.105 --> 26:46.572
Well, the hairlines and the perky boobs

26:46.608 --> 26:48.073
aren't the only phony things

26:48.109 --> 26:49.208
at that school.

26:49.244 --> 26:50.876
You want to know who killed her?

26:50.912 --> 26:54.346
You should go to that grieving
gathering they're throwing.

26:54.382 --> 26:56.550
All her frenemies will be there.

27:03.525 --> 27:06.325
(mumbling quietly)

27:06.361 --> 27:07.826
(snaps fingers)

27:07.862 --> 27:10.596
Never seen you so worried
about an outfit, Decker.

27:10.632 --> 27:13.732
Not picking up the first
coat off the floor as usual?

27:13.768 --> 27:15.300
Nope.

27:15.336 --> 27:16.802
No, I'm not.

27:16.838 --> 27:18.270
I am going

27:18.306 --> 27:19.962
to a grieving gathering at the school,

27:20.025 --> 27:23.275
and, well, you should
see the other parents.

27:23.311 --> 27:24.643
They are very fancy.

27:24.679 --> 27:26.211
It's...

27:26.247 --> 27:27.713
- (sniffs)
- You know what?

27:27.749 --> 27:29.481
Never mind. I don't
want to make you sick

27:29.517 --> 27:30.783
- with my feelings.
- No.

27:30.819 --> 27:32.618
Come on. I'm listening, I promise.

27:32.621 --> 27:33.988
No more earbuds.

27:37.559 --> 27:39.658
Okay, Trixie might get
into this private school,

27:39.694 --> 27:41.760
and it could be really,
really good for her.

27:41.796 --> 27:43.228
But it's super exclusive,

27:43.264 --> 27:45.998
and I'm not sure that I want
her in that kind of environment.

27:46.034 --> 27:49.168
That's what you're so worried about?

27:49.204 --> 27:50.436
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

27:50.472 --> 27:52.171
A school like that is great for Trixie.

27:52.207 --> 27:53.272
You think so?

27:53.308 --> 27:54.206
Yeah.

27:54.242 --> 27:55.641
Fancy-pants rich kids?

27:55.677 --> 27:56.909
They're like vipers, okay?

27:56.945 --> 27:58.844
Trixie will learn to
slash them with her words.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.014
Then I will teach her the knives.

28:02.050 --> 28:03.916
Oh, okay.

28:03.952 --> 28:06.185
I think... I know you're trying to help,

28:06.221 --> 28:07.686
but, uh, I don't think

28:07.722 --> 28:10.124
you can help me with... with this now.

28:22.203 --> 28:23.868

Yeah. (chuckles nervously)

WOMAN: Aw.

28:31.346 --> 28:32.945
That must be difficult.

28:32.981 --> 28:35.649
Actually, she's with me.

Oh. Two mommies?

28:41.723 --> 28:43.555
Oh, hell yeah.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.824

- Trixie's a handful,

28:45.860 --> 28:48.200
definitely a two-woman job.

28:48.203 --> 28:49.497

28:59.490 --> 29:02.855
Look, I'm not good at listening.

29:02.891 --> 29:05.324
Or talking about emotion stuff.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.292
But I do know you don't let your girl

29:07.328 --> 29:10.095
go into enemy territory alone.

29:10.131 --> 29:11.198
Thank you.

29:13.535 --> 29:16.001
Oh, wow.

29:16.037 --> 29:18.537
I guess networking is the new grieving.

29:18.573 --> 29:19.706
MAZE: Mm-hmm.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.375
You're Trixie's moms, right?

29:23.411 --> 29:25.611
- Mm.
- I'm the event coordinator here.

29:25.647 --> 29:27.112
I just wanted to tell you

29:27.148 --> 29:30.282
that we'd be so happy to have
you as part of the family.

29:30.318 --> 29:32.951
Mid-afternoon yoga always
needs more volunteers.

29:32.987 --> 29:33.983
(giggles)

29:33.986 --> 29:35.824
I would love to, but mid-afternoons,

29:35.835 --> 29:36.655
I'm at my job.

29:36.658 --> 29:37.890
- Oh.
- Yeah.

29:37.926 --> 29:40.092
She's a homicide detective.

29:40.128 --> 29:41.060
Oh.

29:41.096 --> 29:42.694
She has a gun and everything.

29:42.730 --> 29:43.695
(woman chuckles)

29:43.731 --> 29:45.664
A real pistol in the sack, too.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.032

- Oh!

29:47.068 --> 29:48.667
(chuckles) Jokester.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.469
I wish I had time for a job.

29:50.505 --> 29:51.737
But you know what they say:

29:51.773 --> 29:54.873
exceptional child, exhausted mom.

29:54.909 --> 29:56.275
(giggles)

29:56.311 --> 29:57.711
Mm-hmm.

29:59.286 --> 30:00.951
I've never heard anyone say that.

30:00.954 --> 30:02.981
- (scoffs)
- Doesn't makes sense.

30:03.017 --> 30:05.350
Maze, look at everybody.
Look at these parents.

30:05.386 --> 30:07.386
Who has a kid and is this put together?

30:07.422 --> 30:09.021
Use those detective skills, Decker.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.223
Get out of your own head. Look around.

30:11.259 --> 30:12.157
All right.

30:12.193 --> 30:13.959
That entire table over there

30:13.995 --> 30:16.128
is just waiting for that
couple to go nuclear.

30:16.164 --> 30:18.464
(chuckles) Oh, when
that woman walked in,

30:18.500 --> 30:21.533
the entire room started
commenting on her cheek-filler.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.235
- Hmm.
- They're miserable.

30:23.271 --> 30:25.137
And waiting to tear each other apart.

30:25.173 --> 30:27.439
Actually...

30:27.475 --> 30:29.308
reminds me of home.

30:29.344 --> 30:31.610
Hmm.

30:31.646 --> 30:34.613
You know what? You're right.

30:34.649 --> 30:36.915
They love gossip.

30:36.951 --> 30:39.785
And the juicier, the better.

30:39.821 --> 30:41.086
You know what?

30:41.122 --> 30:43.323
Let's give them something to talk about.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.259

Too much of that will make you go blind.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.151
Mom was right.

31:12.187 --> 31:15.166
I can't make it work.

31:15.169 --> 31:17.089
Ah, I see. You're up here

31:17.125 --> 31:19.458
practicing a different kind
of self-flagellation, are you?

31:19.494 --> 31:21.793
Hoping for a celestial spark?

31:21.829 --> 31:23.195
You don't even have your powers.

31:23.231 --> 31:25.497
Yeah, thanks for that reminder, Luci.

31:25.533 --> 31:27.766
You know, I also don't seem

31:27.769 --> 31:30.036
to have much of Mom's attention anymore.

31:30.039 --> 31:32.004
Because, unlike you,

31:32.040 --> 31:36.442
I don't have some glorious
destiny to wield the sword.

31:36.445 --> 31:38.028
(sighs) And what's so great

31:38.031 --> 31:39.597
about Mum's attention?

31:39.600 --> 31:41.666
She nearly killed me
in the car park earlier,

31:41.669 --> 31:43.582
trying to help me achieve that destiny.

31:43.585 --> 31:46.114
Oh, good job warning me she's
strong enough to lift a house,

31:46.117 --> 31:46.852
by the way.

31:46.888 --> 31:49.188
Same old Luci, always the victim.

31:49.224 --> 31:51.990
Can't you just be grateful for once?

31:52.026 --> 31:53.258
You're the Lightbringer!

31:53.294 --> 31:54.092
Am I?

31:54.128 --> 31:55.561
Am I, indeed?

31:55.597 --> 31:57.629
'Cause so far, it's
just Mum's word against,

31:57.665 --> 31:59.299
well, reality.

32:00.535 --> 32:02.534
What if she's wrong, brother?

32:02.570 --> 32:05.370
She's been acting very odd recently.

32:05.406 --> 32:06.838
On edge.

32:06.874 --> 32:08.707
This obsession with getting home,

32:08.743 --> 32:10.055
it's a bit much, don't you think?

32:10.057 --> 32:12.190
(scoffs)

32:12.193 --> 32:14.929
You see, I thought we
all wanted to go back.

32:14.932 --> 32:17.082
You know I don't lie, brother.

32:17.118 --> 32:20.719
So trust me when I say
nothing would make me happier

32:20.755 --> 32:22.721
than Mum getting her wish.

32:22.724 --> 32:25.682
Then you need to stop
fighting this, Luci,

32:25.685 --> 32:26.854
and find a way

32:26.857 --> 32:28.456
to get the sword to work.

32:28.542 --> 32:32.798
Because whether we like it or not,

32:32.834 --> 32:34.900
it is all on you.

32:34.936 --> 32:37.070
Lightbringer.

32:42.749 --> 32:45.939
You, uh, call this pâté, huh?

32:45.942 --> 32:47.494
(chuckles) I know, right?

32:47.497 --> 32:49.654
You know, say what
you will about Debbie,

32:49.657 --> 32:52.486
but that woman knew
how to cater a party.

32:53.199 --> 32:55.365
You're married to that cop, right?

32:55.368 --> 32:57.368
Yeah.

32:57.803 --> 33:00.104
Actually, can you keep a secret?

33:01.638 --> 33:03.638
My wife is very close

33:03.641 --> 33:06.230
to making an arrest.

33:06.233 --> 33:09.254
We think the killer
might actually be here.

33:10.453 --> 33:12.919
She found evidence just tonight.

33:12.955 --> 33:14.087
DNA.

33:14.123 --> 33:16.256
It's in the car right now.

33:16.292 --> 33:21.329
Somebody here is going to jail.

33:22.915 --> 33:25.732
Oh, but keep that on the DL, all right?

33:25.768 --> 33:26.701
Knuckles.

33:33.776 --> 33:34.808
(gasps)

33:34.844 --> 33:38.213
Five gossips down, a
couple more to be safe.

33:40.349 --> 33:42.649
No, look, this is plenty.

33:42.685 --> 33:45.819
Let's hope they take the bait.

33:45.855 --> 33:47.654
Okay, all I have to do now

33:47.690 --> 33:50.390
is stake out the car,
if the killer is here,

33:50.426 --> 33:52.360
they'll go out there for the evidence.

33:54.000 --> 34:00.074

34:02.338 --> 34:03.303
Ah.

34:03.339 --> 34:05.071
Just the person I'm looking for.

34:05.107 --> 34:06.773
- Mr. Morningstar.
- Yes.

34:06.809 --> 34:09.242
Look, I'm willing to give
your Kumbaya curriculum

34:09.277 --> 34:10.744
a second look.

34:10.780 --> 34:13.112
Perhaps if I'm more specific
about what I want out of it:

34:13.149 --> 34:15.114
uh, less watercolors,

34:15.150 --> 34:17.283
more, sort of, heavenly flames?

34:17.319 --> 34:18.885
Are you following me?

34:18.920 --> 34:20.987
Sorry, do you need something
out of the detective's car?

34:20.989 --> 34:23.822
Uh, uh, yeah, she-she asked
me to grab something for her.

34:23.859 --> 34:24.690
Ah.

34:24.726 --> 34:26.226
Well, let's get that over with,

34:26.262 --> 34:28.966
so we can focus on what's important: me.

34:29.065 --> 34:30.697
(car alarm chirps)

34:30.733 --> 34:33.800
Uh, don't tell her I,
uh, got a copy made.

34:33.835 --> 34:36.770
She gets all fussy about
things like illegal duplicates.

34:36.806 --> 34:39.242
So, uh, do you do private tutoring?

34:39.245 --> 34:40.774
'Cause I'm free most of the time.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.074
Specifically now.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.409
Yeah.

34:43.446 --> 34:45.945
Lucifer, what are you doing?

34:45.981 --> 34:48.547
Uh, Madison said she needed
something from your car.

34:48.583 --> 34:49.916
What?

34:49.952 --> 34:51.184
She's the killer.

34:51.204 --> 34:53.837
(chuckles) That's
quite a leap, Detective.

34:53.856 --> 34:55.623
No, it isn't. Lucifer, please, she...

34:58.427 --> 35:01.061
My gun's in the car.

35:01.097 --> 35:04.130
Well, why didn't you
tell me all this earlier?

35:04.166 --> 35:06.943
- Put your hands up.
- (sighs)

35:08.869 --> 35:09.899
Stay back!

35:12.228 --> 35:13.994
- Stay back!
- Madison,

35:14.030 --> 35:15.829
- put down the gun.
- Yes.

35:15.865 --> 35:17.165
Perhaps if you channel your feelings

35:17.167 --> 35:18.566
into something other than bullets,

35:18.602 --> 35:20.067
that might...

35:20.103 --> 35:21.136
- (yelping)
- Okay.

35:22.672 --> 35:24.271
I said stay back!

35:24.307 --> 35:26.475
Okay, got it.

35:27.444 --> 35:28.811
Oh, you!

35:30.413 --> 35:32.413
This is all your fault!

35:32.449 --> 35:33.681
With your stupid

35:33.717 --> 35:36.579
handsome face and your chiseled abs

35:36.582 --> 35:37.714
and your huge...

35:37.717 --> 35:39.687
You slept with the P.E. teacher, too?

35:39.723 --> 35:42.022
Well, the movement and wellness
mentor, Detective, but...

35:42.058 --> 35:45.159
CHLOE: Madison, if I've
learned anything here tonight,

35:45.195 --> 35:47.861
it's that everyone here has secrets.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.196
No one's perfect.

35:49.232 --> 35:50.464
Okay?

35:50.500 --> 35:52.433
- But we didn't have sex.
- (gasps)

35:52.469 --> 35:53.634
Well, I mean, okay, one time.

35:53.670 --> 35:55.369
But, come on, that was, like, years ago.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.004
One time was all it took.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.374
This is about your son, isn't it?

36:00.410 --> 36:01.650
LUCIFER: What? You mean the boy

36:01.678 --> 36:03.944
in the class with the special
diet of boogers and paste?

36:03.980 --> 36:04.945
Lucifer.

36:04.981 --> 36:05.813
I...

36:05.849 --> 36:07.615
MADISON: God knows I love Ranger,

36:07.651 --> 36:11.118
but he's not very smart.

36:11.154 --> 36:12.720
My husband is,

36:12.756 --> 36:15.522
and that witch Debbie
put two and two together.

36:15.558 --> 36:17.491
And she told you that she was gonna

36:17.527 --> 36:19.493
expose Mr. Taylor as Ranger's

36:19.529 --> 36:20.694
real father.

36:20.730 --> 36:22.563
She hated how all the moms loved him.

36:22.599 --> 36:24.798
My husband would've left me.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.300
Madison, I understand.

36:26.336 --> 36:28.335
You were just thinking
of your son's future.

36:28.371 --> 36:30.471
I-I get it. I-I'm a mother, too.

36:30.507 --> 36:32.940
Um, maybe you remember
Trixie, my daughter.

36:32.976 --> 36:34.176
Th-The little girl who was sad

36:34.210 --> 36:36.076
because her mom had such a scary job.

36:36.112 --> 36:37.945
That's me. She's my daughter.

36:37.981 --> 36:40.382
So, please,

36:40.385 --> 36:43.018
Madison, put down the gun.

36:47.691 --> 36:49.390
I'm so sorry.

36:49.426 --> 36:50.958
I-I got so angry,

36:50.994 --> 36:52.993
I couldn't control myself.

36:53.029 --> 36:54.228
What? Hold on.

36:54.264 --> 36:56.363
All this talk about
controlling your emotions

36:56.366 --> 36:59.800
and harnessing them for
creation was all just a sham?

36:59.836 --> 37:02.202
I tried so hard to make it real.

37:02.238 --> 37:04.805
- (sighs)
- We can't control our emotions.

37:04.841 --> 37:06.607
We just have to keep try...

37:06.643 --> 37:08.342
(Madison screams)

37:08.378 --> 37:10.310
(crowd gasps)

37:10.346 --> 37:13.347
(panting)

37:13.383 --> 37:17.017
Listening to feelings,
it's not my thing.

37:17.053 --> 37:18.520
Right, honey?

37:19.989 --> 37:21.221
You know, if I were you,

37:21.257 --> 37:23.390
I'd take my child out of this school.

37:23.426 --> 37:24.560
Terrible place.

37:26.229 --> 37:27.428
Wait.

37:27.464 --> 37:28.964
I'm a father?

37:30.533 --> 37:33.869
(laughs): That's awesome.

37:38.274 --> 37:40.209
(softly): Here you go.

37:42.746 --> 37:44.713
How cute this guy is.

37:47.083 --> 37:48.749
So...

37:48.785 --> 37:51.285
I went back to that school today.

37:51.321 --> 37:54.280
And I think they'd let
you in if you wanted to go.

37:54.283 --> 37:56.451
So how do you feel about that?

37:57.778 --> 38:01.230
Well, can I tell you how
it made me feel being there?

38:02.046 --> 38:03.411
Well, at first,

38:03.414 --> 38:07.501
it made me feel insecure and worried.

38:07.537 --> 38:10.003
I mean, the school is so fancy,

38:10.039 --> 38:12.906
and all the other
mommies seemed so perfect.

38:12.942 --> 38:15.008
But guess what I found out.

38:15.044 --> 38:15.809
What?

38:15.845 --> 38:18.145
That the other mommies,

38:18.181 --> 38:20.948
they were just as worried as I was.

38:20.984 --> 38:23.684
And they were just
pretending to be perfect.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.054
Is it bad to pretend?

38:27.057 --> 38:29.356
No, not always, Monkey.

38:29.359 --> 38:32.392
I mean, sometimes people feel like...

38:32.428 --> 38:34.728
(sighs)

38:34.764 --> 38:37.131
like they have to pretend
that everything's okay.

38:37.167 --> 38:38.499
But...

38:38.535 --> 38:42.369
And this is the most important part...

38:42.405 --> 38:44.104
You and me,

38:44.140 --> 38:46.475
we never have to

38:46.478 --> 38:49.113
pretend with each other. (sniffles)

38:51.447 --> 38:54.014
I really didn't like that school.

38:54.050 --> 38:56.216
(whispers): I didn't like it either.

38:56.252 --> 38:57.586
(chuckles)

39:00.890 --> 39:03.025
Thanks for telling me, Monkey.

39:09.582 --> 39:11.681
It turns out you were right, Doctor.

39:11.684 --> 39:14.518
It's impossible to
control your feelings.

39:14.521 --> 39:17.020
And anyone who does risks
turning into a murderous lunatic

39:17.023 --> 39:19.457
with a child of below-average
intelligence, so...

39:19.460 --> 39:20.774
Yeah, well, I'm sure

39:20.810 --> 39:23.644
at least some of that,
that's inaccurate.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.714
But I'm glad you've come around.

39:26.983 --> 39:30.450
Are you ready to be
more forthcoming now?

39:30.486 --> 39:31.618
(sighs)

39:31.654 --> 39:33.754
Yes, I suppose.

39:33.790 --> 39:36.490
If that's what it takes
to get you to help me.

39:36.526 --> 39:38.826
So...

39:38.862 --> 39:39.993
um...

39:40.029 --> 39:42.529
I wasn't lying before, obviously.

39:42.565 --> 39:44.898
I do intend to use the Flaming Sword

39:44.934 --> 39:46.800
to cut through the Gates of Heaven.

39:46.836 --> 39:48.435
But what you left out...?

39:48.471 --> 39:50.070
Is that once I do that,

39:50.106 --> 39:52.439
I plan on kicking Mum into Heaven

39:52.475 --> 39:54.874
and slamming the gates on her backside.

39:54.877 --> 39:57.277
But she'll be trapped there,

39:57.280 --> 39:59.379
on her own.

39:59.415 --> 40:01.179
Won't God destroy her?

40:01.182 --> 40:03.282
Hopefully, they tear each other apart.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.350
Then they'll both get what they deserve.

40:05.386 --> 40:06.452
What's that?

40:06.488 --> 40:08.253
Punishment.

40:08.289 --> 40:09.855
For manipulating me.

40:09.891 --> 40:11.290
I mean, Dad set a trap for me,

40:11.326 --> 40:13.559
but Mum was the one who made
sure that I fell into it.

40:13.595 --> 40:17.064
She was the one that
made sure that I felt...

40:18.766 --> 40:20.999
that I...

40:21.035 --> 40:23.735
that I felt things that I
don't want to feel anymore.

40:23.771 --> 40:24.937
That, right there,

40:24.973 --> 40:28.874
that what you stopped
yourself from feeling,

40:28.910 --> 40:30.709
that's exactly what you need to feel.

40:30.745 --> 40:31.910
What, the anger?

40:31.946 --> 40:33.512
Oh, I feel it.

40:33.548 --> 40:36.448
Not the anger.

40:36.484 --> 40:37.683
The pain.

40:37.719 --> 40:39.918
That's what you've been suppressing.

40:39.954 --> 40:43.388
All the pain and heartbreak

40:43.424 --> 40:46.059
that you have over what
happened with your mother.

40:48.842 --> 40:50.427
And Chloe.

40:53.468 --> 40:57.603
I know it's difficult.

40:57.639 --> 41:00.272
But the only way to
get over that pain...

41:00.308 --> 41:01.540
(chuckles softly)

41:01.576 --> 41:03.113
is to go through it.

41:07.649 --> 41:10.649
AMENADIEL: <i>So you think
you've figured it out?</i>

41:10.685 --> 41:12.151
Yes.

41:12.187 --> 41:14.119
And you're sure this time?

41:14.155 --> 41:14.920
Just...

41:14.956 --> 41:17.925
let me do it, Mum, please.

41:24.332 --> 41:26.166
♪

41:41.382 --> 41:43.317
(sobbing softly)

41:59.534 --> 42:00.966
That's it?!

42:01.002 --> 42:02.768
You must not be feeling enough!

42:02.804 --> 42:04.636
(scoffs) Trust me.

42:04.656 --> 42:06.770
That's it. That's all I've got!

42:06.773 --> 42:08.973
You have to try harder.

42:08.976 --> 42:10.409
- What?
- Try harder!

42:10.445 --> 42:12.844
Mom! That's enough!

42:12.880 --> 42:14.513
I'm not broken.

42:14.549 --> 42:16.481
The sword must be.

42:16.517 --> 42:17.816
Okay.

42:17.852 --> 42:19.411
Okay, then we'll fix it.

42:19.414 --> 42:20.485
There's plenty of time.

42:20.521 --> 42:22.521
(chuckles)

42:22.557 --> 42:23.722
Of course.

42:23.758 --> 42:25.457
You're right, son.

42:25.493 --> 42:28.393
There's plenty of time.

42:28.429 --> 42:30.197
(scoffs)

42:38.406 --> 42:40.374
(elevator bell dings)

42:51.552 --> 42:54.353
(exhales)

42:54.389 --> 42:56.323
Just not for me.
