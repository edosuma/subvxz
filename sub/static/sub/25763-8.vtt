>> KIM: I need to get a cuticle
cutter.

39:54.467 --> 39:57.667
My nail is falling off.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

39:57.667 --> 40:00.400
>> KIM: I feel like I also need
to get, like, lingerie and

40:00.400 --> 40:03.533
stuff.
>> KOURTNEY: For Valentine's?

40:03.533 --> 40:05.734
>> KIM: Yeah.
I don't know.

40:05.734 --> 40:08.600
Just, like, when you have, like,
so many kids, it's, like,

40:08.600 --> 40:13.467
important to make your
relationship still, like, a top

40:13.467 --> 40:16.033
priority.
>> KOURTNEY: You should want to.

40:16.033 --> 40:18.567
>> KIM: Yeah.
I think you just have to.

40:18.567 --> 40:21.500
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: Like, no matter what.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.000
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: Kanye is really into,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.133
like, the small, little, cute
things.

40:26.133 --> 40:29.667
So, for Valentine's Day, I'm
gonna get him all of his

40:29.667 --> 40:32.767
favorite Band-Aids and have a
heart box of Band-Aids.

40:32.767 --> 40:35.100
Oh, Kourt, your favorite.
They have flu shots.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.500
I think he'll think it's really
cute.

40:37.500 --> 40:42.500
Tough strips. No, more.
I actually think this is enough.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.633
Kanye's so thoughtful and even
when he's really, like, in crazy

40:45.633 --> 40:49.500
work mode, he always takes the
time to check in on me to see

40:49.500 --> 40:53.033
what's going on.
And I think when I get in super

40:53.033 --> 40:57.133
busy mode, I need to really
just, like, slow down and be a

40:57.133 --> 41:01.600
little bit more thoughtful.
I think I've definitely gotten

41:01.600 --> 41:04.600
better with that after this.
It's called Excitement,

41:04.600 --> 41:06.667
Excitement.
Hi.

41:06.667 --> 41:09.133
Like, I swear I've worn some of
this stuff out before.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.533
Like, I've gotten, like, this.
>> KOURTNEY: The dress?

41:11.533 --> 41:13.133
>> KIM: Or, like, a top like
that.

41:13.133 --> 41:16.133
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.
>> KIM: And, like, it's $1.99.

41:16.133 --> 41:19.066
Oh, my God, you're gonna think
I'm, like, joking, but I love

41:19.066 --> 41:23.166
these shoes.
>> KOURTNEY: Do you want a nurse

41:23.166 --> 41:26.066
costume?
You should get a nurse since he

41:26.066 --> 41:29.600
said you don't take care of him.
>> KIM: (laughs)

41:29.600 --> 41:32.467
He's ignoring me once he
realized I was on a filter.

41:32.467 --> 41:35.533
Hey, Rob. Say, "Happy
Valentine's Day."

41:35.533 --> 41:38.467
>> ROB: Happy Valentine's Day.
>> KIM: Now that our fight is

41:38.467 --> 41:41.734
over, Kourtney and I thought it
would be really cute to just go

41:41.734 --> 41:45.166
and bring all the kids and go
skiing.

41:45.166 --> 41:49.567
All right, it's our first day on
the slopes.

41:49.567 --> 41:53.767
Kourtney, me and Mason, we are
going skiing, guys.

41:53.767 --> 41:56.633
I am excited to go away with
Kourtney.

41:56.633 --> 42:00.166
I think it'll be just a good,
few, fun days of just skiing and

42:00.166 --> 42:04.767
having fun and no drama.
