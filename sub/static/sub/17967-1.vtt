00:11.544 --> 00:14.013
           (whirring)

00:14.114 --> 00:16.515
         (music playing)

00:17.384 --> 00:19.351
    (computer alert beeping)

00:19.452 --> 00:22.388
         <i> Ab, Ab, Ab-- No</i>
         <i> joke, today is the day</i>

00:22.489 --> 00:24.189
      <i> we become Abbi and Ilana,</i>
      <i> the boss bitches</i>

00:24.290 --> 00:25.691
           <i> we are in our minds.</i>

00:25.792 --> 00:26.825
               Are you with me?

00:26.926 --> 00:29.094
Yeah, I'm with
you, awesome.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.831
Are you--
Is that the whole thing?

00:32.932 --> 00:34.333
       <i> Obviously I have a plan.</i>

00:34.434 --> 00:38.303
 Tonight we are going to see a
 secret pop-up Lil Wayne concert

00:38.405 --> 00:39.471
            at Bowery Ballroom.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.707
I can't, I'm so broke.
              <i> No excuses, girl.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:43.575
      <i> I'm getting big ol' balls</i>
      <i> of mozzarella today.</i>

00:43.676 --> 00:44.576
                 <i> Chea-- Get it!</i>

00:44.677 --> 00:46.311
                 <i> Chea-- Harder.</i>

00:46.413 --> 00:48.280
You're gonna have to speak
in English for me.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.649
 <i> I am getting my paycheck today</i>
 <i> and I can spot you, bitch!</i>

00:50.750 --> 00:51.917
I wish that I could,

00:52.018 --> 00:54.720
but I am so close to finishing
season one of "Damages,"

00:54.821 --> 00:57.689
and I made, this,
like, amazing cashew stir-fry

00:57.791 --> 00:59.925
for the week, so I'm
actually pretty booked.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.860
                      <i> Stir-fry?</i>

01:01.961 --> 01:04.096
         <i> Can I talk to the Abbi</i>
         <i> who stole a van?</i>

01:04.197 --> 01:06.765
        <i> Ab, you're so stuck</i>
        <i> in your little routine.</i>

01:06.866 --> 01:08.367
        <i> I bet you schedule when</i>
        <i> you jack off.</i>

01:08.468 --> 01:12.237
Schedule when I ja--
        (exhales deeply)

01:12.338 --> 01:14.106
Oh, my God.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.307
Is that Lincoln?

01:15.408 --> 01:16.408
              Yep.

01:16.509 --> 01:17.609
<i>Is he inside</i>
<i>of you?</i>

01:17.710 --> 01:18.710
              Yep.

01:18.812 --> 01:19.878
        <i> I'm just</i>
        <i> keeping him warm.</i>

01:19.979 --> 01:21.580
All right-- Let's just set
some ground rules here

01:21.681 --> 01:23.115
for everybody involved.

01:23.216 --> 01:25.184
<i>I don't want to</i>
<i>see you have sex.</i>

01:25.285 --> 01:26.785
<i>Let's try and</i>
<i>avoid that.</i>

01:26.886 --> 01:28.987
Lincoln, you seem well.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.956
      Thank you-- I've been
    doing this no-bread diet

01:31.057 --> 01:32.591
      and it's pretty good.

01:32.692 --> 01:33.659
       It's been working.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.294
All right--
I'm gonna head out, then.

01:35.395 --> 01:36.762
                    Peace, bye.

01:36.863 --> 01:37.763
That was hot--
That was cool.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.698
That was like a threesome,
in a way.

01:39.799 --> 01:41.633
              Uh, Ilana,
              what are we doing?

01:41.734 --> 01:43.335
         Are we just having sex,
         hooking up?

01:43.436 --> 01:44.570
                 Are we dating?

01:44.671 --> 01:45.671
                  What is this?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.907
This is purely
physical.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.943
            Why does this
            always happen to me?

01:51.044 --> 01:53.412
    ¶ Four and three and two
          and one-one ¶

02:01.287 --> 02:03.322
(Abbi)
Climb--
Push it!

02:03.423 --> 02:04.523
Come on!

02:04.624 --> 02:05.657
Let's make some
magic here.

02:05.758 --> 02:06.892
Let's climb it.

02:06.993 --> 02:08.926
Turn up that resistance--
Come on.

02:09.027 --> 02:10.162
Let's do this.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.898
Yes, climb.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.466
                       Yo, Abbi.
Hey.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.335
                   Got something
                   for you.
Okay.

02:16.436 --> 02:17.836
          Big ol' clogged toilet
          in the girls' room.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.338
               It's pretty bad.

02:19.439 --> 02:20.672
                You'll know it
                when you see it.

02:20.773 --> 02:21.707
Thanks for
the heads-up, Tre.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.908
             No problem--
             Just do me a favor.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.276
     Try not to make eye contact
     with any members

02:24.377 --> 02:25.544
            when you're
            holding the plunger.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.745
           Really bums 'em out.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.814
Well, I mean, what if
someone just, like, walks--

02:36.389 --> 02:37.689
              (man)
       Underwater massage?

02:37.790 --> 02:40.125
         Yes-- Yes, that
         sounds intense.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.326
     Great job, killing it.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.562
         Who's got more
             deals?

02:43.663 --> 02:45.097
            Who else
       has a deal for me?

02:45.198 --> 02:46.865
       Ooh, Nicole, what's
           your deal.

02:46.966 --> 02:49.735
 I'm kind of obsessed with
 these D-I-Y vajazzling seminars

02:49.836 --> 02:52.204
     and I feel like they'd be a
     really great fit for us.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.239
          That is what
       I'm talking about.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.574
     Do you guys smell that?

02:55.675 --> 02:56.675
         Come on, sniff
            the air.

02:56.776 --> 02:57.776
      Oh, what's that odor?

02:57.877 --> 02:59.244
     I think it's the scent
           of a deal.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.245
            Who's got
       more deals for me?

03:00.346 --> 03:01.813
        Ooh, in the back,
             Ilana.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.249
        Dope sweatshirt--
       What is your deal?

03:04.350 --> 03:07.419
      I've been kind of obsessed
      with getting paid

03:07.520 --> 03:09.221
       and I was wondering
       if that's happening today

03:09.322 --> 03:11.957
                 so we could all
                 be paid.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.993
     Checks, unfortunately,
      delayed 'til Friday.

03:15.094 --> 03:16.395
             Bummer.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.930
          F-M-L, right?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.965
       Speaking of F-M-L,
      went on a third date

03:20.066 --> 03:21.466
       with that girl from
           Match.com,

03:21.568 --> 03:22.801
    to keep you guys updated,

03:22.902 --> 03:24.770
 third time, went for the kiss,
      third time rejected,

03:24.871 --> 03:26.471
         but I'll try--
          I'll get it.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.209
            Let's get
       back to our desks.

03:30.310 --> 03:33.011
        Deals don't make
           themselves.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.714
             (Ilana)
      Bonjour, petit Wayne.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.017
         I am a genius.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.719
                   (man)
                   Not so much--
                   Right, buddy?

03:40.820 --> 03:42.454
            That's the look of a
            dealer right there.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.989
          If I was in Las Vegas,
          I'd assume you could

03:44.090 --> 03:45.157
          move the table limit.

03:45.258 --> 03:46.892
            That's how much of a
            dealer you are.

03:50.496 --> 03:51.697
                          Ilana.
              Ooh.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.366
               Come on,
               this is not work.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.201
           Oh... Okay,
        I'll take lunch.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.469
                      Please...

03:57.570 --> 03:58.770
               Come back today.

04:04.611 --> 04:05.544
                         Oh!

04:05.645 --> 04:06.678
                         Ilana.

04:06.779 --> 04:10.015
             Don't Black Swan me
             like that, dude.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.750
            Okay, what are
            you even doing here?

04:11.851 --> 04:13.418
Nothing-- Just strolling
through the neighborhood

04:13.519 --> 04:14.453
and wanted to
see my number one.

04:14.554 --> 04:15.821
                    Oh, really?

04:15.922 --> 04:18.390
Okay, listen-- I really
think that you deserve--
                            Hey.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.358
Sorry, I forgot
about the line.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.194
I'll see you in the
second-class citizen area.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.396
      It's called the non-member
      pen and you know that.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.998
Ew--
Listen to yourself.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.201
I think you deserve like an
Abbi Bueller's day off.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.936
       I can't just leave work
       in the middle of the day.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.938
Yes, you can--
You just lie and leave.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.973
All they let you do is
fold towels, anyway.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.141
                No, they don't.

04:36.242 --> 04:37.909
             They let me do a
             lot more than that.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.979
      I wash the towels and then
      I dry the towels.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.382
           Great... to see you.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.484
Good friend?
                   Uh-huh, yeah,
                   she's great.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.753
       Also, any day now, a
       trainer's gonna be absent

04:47.854 --> 04:52.491
    and guess who they're gonna
    invite to instruct a class.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.559
I would love for that to
happen, but it's just not.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.661
They don't respect you.

04:55.762 --> 04:56.762
      Oh, thank God, Abbi,
         there you are.

04:56.863 --> 04:57.963
                         Tre.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.498
                      Thank God.
         We really need
          you, buddy.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.133
             Yes, I'm prepared.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.302
              So...

05:03.403 --> 05:05.404
  We got another pube situation
   in the women's locker room.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.039
         Yeah-- Somebody
       really went to town

05:07.140 --> 05:08.173
      in the second shower
             stall.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.341
           And if you
         need the snake,

05:09.442 --> 05:10.609
     it's probably wherever
        you last left it.

05:10.710 --> 05:11.843
                I know
                where it is, so.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.211
    You know, you should just
    label it "Abbi's snake,"

05:13.313 --> 05:15.147
    you're so good with it.
                 I don't know if
                 I wanna...

05:15.248 --> 05:17.149
           Seriously.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.651
           Okay, Abbi,
            come on.

05:19.752 --> 05:20.986
     Can I get a little more
  positivity from you, please?

05:21.087 --> 05:22.020
                 I'll clean it.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.088
      You can be positive,
             right?

05:23.189 --> 05:24.890
           I know you
        can be positive.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.493
                  Yeah, you know
                  what?

05:28.594 --> 05:29.695
              You know,
              I can be positive,

05:29.796 --> 05:31.563
             because I actually
             might be positive.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.265
       I'm dealing with some
       pretty scary test results

05:33.366 --> 05:34.866
            that are at a clinic
            right now

05:34.967 --> 05:36.768
           and I have to get
           'em, but I'm at work.

05:36.869 --> 05:39.738
  I mean, I might be positive in
  a blood situation, so...

05:39.839 --> 05:40.939
          Is it herpes?

05:41.040 --> 05:42.341
                  No, it's not.

05:42.442 --> 05:45.911
         Genital warts.
                             No.

05:46.012 --> 05:46.945
           Oh, my God.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.280
              Abbi.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.614
       Is it the big one?

05:49.716 --> 05:51.149
                    It could be
                    the big one.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.317
       Abbi, you gotta get
         those results?

05:52.418 --> 05:53.518
                     I gotta get
                     the pubes.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.053
           Don't worry
     about the pubes, Abbi.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.655
        Get your results.

05:56.756 --> 05:59.057
     Blaise, there you are--
     Would you get to class?

06:00.526 --> 06:01.693
              Abbi.

06:01.794 --> 06:02.894
           Let me know
        if you have AIDS.

06:02.995 --> 06:05.097
         You'll be the first one
         that I tell.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.832
               When I find out.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.074

06:16.309 --> 06:19.177
                Okay, so tickets
                are 50 each.

06:19.278 --> 06:21.213
                 Obviously, we
                 need an eighth.
Ok.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.015
        Plus drinks, that's like
        200 bucks total.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.351
         And since Todd wouldn't
         give me my paycheck.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.653
                         Girl!

06:28.755 --> 06:31.289
You took all of
his office supplies.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.592
             Listen, what I do
             at my place of work

06:33.693 --> 06:35.594
          is none of your godamn
          business, okay?

06:35.695 --> 06:38.663
Okay, I think you really
need to be fired really soon.
                         I know.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.601
    ("What a Wonderful World"
            playing)

06:42.702 --> 06:43.902
          Oh, I love this song.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.204
Ugh--
This is a slave song.

06:46.305 --> 06:47.773
                   It's not
                   a slave song.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.040
Yes, it is.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.342
It's widely known
by the black community

06:50.443 --> 06:52.711
that "What a Wonderful World"
is, like, a slave song.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.246
     Right, right, right, I
     totally forgot that you're,

06:54.347 --> 06:56.281
    like, the voice of the whole
    black community.

06:56.382 --> 06:57.983
It's a thing--
Google it.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.284
It's in
a Fugees song.

06:59.385 --> 07:01.753
Wyclef's like, "And I think
to myself."

07:01.854 --> 07:03.088
He's like
angry about it.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.257
    I feel like all we ever talk
    about is black people

07:05.358 --> 07:07.859
              and slaver...y...

07:07.960 --> 07:08.860
            Hi.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.829
         I would like to
       return these items.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.330
        I once owned them
           personally,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.566
          but I have no
      use for them now, so.

07:16.068 --> 07:19.304
Your total comes
to $135.67.

07:19.405 --> 07:20.639
              Yes!
                     Shit-- Yes!

07:22.141 --> 07:23.742
               Oh.

07:23.843 --> 07:27.746
      You know, we'd love
  to get that in liquid cash.
                           Yeah.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.451
              Okay.

07:32.552 --> 07:33.885
          Okay, what about
          my fishbowl of change?

07:33.986 --> 07:35.887
     There's got to be, like, 30
     or 40 bucks in there?

07:35.988 --> 07:37.289
Can you leave?

07:37.390 --> 07:39.491
             Yeah, we're gonna--
          We're ending
           the convo.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.667

     Justin, Justin, there's
      a sniper there-- Oh!

07:48.768 --> 07:50.368
             I just
         told you that!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.270
           Oh, my God.

07:52.371 --> 07:53.705
           Hey, guys.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.873
                     Hey.
              Yo.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.608
          What gun are
           you using?

07:56.709 --> 07:59.544
           Ah, you got
   the variable zoom on that.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.446
     Oh, I'll have to check
            that out.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.849
Sorry, Ilana, all that
cheese you wanted is gone.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.052
It looks like somebody
ate it all.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.086
                    That sucks.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.321
                Cheese is dope.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.324
       Uh-oh, UAV inbound
    courtesy of yours truly.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.326
       (with funny voice)
         You're welcome.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.760
                   Hey, Bevers.

08:15.862 --> 08:19.698
     So I noticed that you
     ate all of my cheese again.

08:19.799 --> 08:20.832
                   Could you not
                   do that?

08:20.933 --> 08:21.900
                       Or maybe
                       get more?

08:22.001 --> 08:23.068
I'm sorry.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.769
I actually didn't realize
it was your cheese.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.905
              I labeled
              it pretty clearly.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.473
Mm-hmm, I see.

08:28.574 --> 08:31.343
Maybe in the future if you do
that, put it on, like--

08:31.444 --> 08:34.746
Like, all six sides
of the cheese brick.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.214
                         Yeah.

08:36.315 --> 08:37.849
          Well, maybe you can
          just restock it, then?

08:37.950 --> 08:39.551
I can put on some sweats and
run out if you want me to.

08:39.652 --> 08:40.684
                     Yeah, okay.
Or, you know...

08:40.785 --> 08:41.785
           (laughing)

08:41.888 --> 08:42.821
I'm not talking
to you!

08:42.922 --> 08:44.089
I'm talking
to my roommate!

08:44.190 --> 08:45.257
                   You're not my
                   roommate.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.192
           You're my
           roommate's boyfriend.
What?

08:47.293 --> 08:49.461
Oh, also,
the toilet's clogged.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.096
My bad.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.964
You know, I think I'm
lactose intolerant.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.966
              Good thing you ate
              all that cheese.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.102
        You know that there's a
        plunger in the bathroom.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.336
                 It's right next
                 to the toilet.

08:58.437 --> 08:59.638
                 It's like,
                 right within...

08:59.739 --> 09:01.339
I do know that, but I
also know that you told me

09:01.440 --> 09:03.275
not to touch your stuff
in the bathroom.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.342
                         Right.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.343
                     That's
                     my mistake.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.878
Yeah.
                 You disgust me.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.380
What?

09:08.481 --> 09:11.049
Oh-- Sergeant

09:11.150 --> 09:13.118

09:15.922 --> 09:18.023
         Both of us are
         over 18, yeah.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.991
        Under 18, I said.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.726
      We're both under 18,
       we're young teens--

09:21.827 --> 09:24.496
             Hello?

09:24.597 --> 09:25.931
           Goddammit.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.602
              Okay.

          the ocean ¶¶

09:38.210 --> 09:39.578

              left a dank turd--

09:39.679 --> 09:42.581
                    Oh, my God.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.049
You still have your
performance bib, right?

09:44.150 --> 09:45.350
                     Yeah, duh.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.953
       This is gonna make a dent
       in the Weezy fund, dude.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.120
Huge dent.

09:49.221 --> 09:50.188
              (man)
        Did you call me?

09:50.289 --> 09:51.990
No, Matt, I didn't
call you!

09:52.091 --> 09:53.491
              It's like, why
              would we call you?

09:53.593 --> 09:56.094
It's like he's constantly
in my face.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.796
    It kills me that he lives
    here and doesn't pay a cent.

09:57.897 --> 10:02.167
I feel dirtier when I leave
the shower because his hair--

10:02.268 --> 10:04.536
his hair is, like,
all over my body.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.738
       It's like I have to see
       your dick in your shorts.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.647
    It just doesn't matter--
           We're done.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.215
           We're done
          as a country.

10:17.316 --> 10:18.950

call me?

else that I can get you,

       but I have been hankering
       for something sweet.

11:31.657 --> 11:33.324

Oh.

and best friend I've ever had.

known to man.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.242
I mean, I think
they even have food now.

12:24.343 --> 12:25.543
               Oh, yeah--
               No, I'll take it.

12:25.644 --> 12:26.678
There's like,
lamps.

12:26.779 --> 12:27.912
                        Please--
Tons of stuff.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.114
                 Give it to me.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.315
Yeah--
That's good...

12:30.416 --> 12:32.617
Trade?
                   I'll take it.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.486
                            Yes.
              Yes.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.087
              (warming up voice)
              Bah, bah,
              black sheep.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.056
Dude, the card worked.
                            Yes.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.058
                     Now we only
                     need 140.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.626
Easy, we're done.
           We're doing it, dude,

12:41.727 --> 12:42.961
           we're getting there.

12:43.062 --> 12:43.962
Is that Lincoln?

12:44.063 --> 12:46.064
         (straw squeaks)

12:46.165 --> 12:48.700
           Why is he doing this
           to me before curtain?

12:50.336 --> 12:52.737
       (warming up voice)
            Bah, bah,
          black sheep.

12:52.838 --> 12:54.105
                Lincoln, why are
                you here?

12:54.206 --> 12:55.140
                    No offense.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.674
I saw your tweet,
so I wanted to stop by,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.243
but I wanted to respect
your space.

12:58.344 --> 12:59.544
That's why
I'm hanging back.

12:59.645 --> 13:00.578
                   That's cool.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.914
                  I respect you
                  respecting me.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.048
Yeah?

13:04.150 --> 13:06.117
               I'm gonna respect
               your dick later.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.421
            (tapping)

13:10.523 --> 13:12.557
                         Yeah!

13:14.260 --> 13:15.326
                      Weekdays
                      are tough.

13:15.427 --> 13:18.496
It's early
for lunch.

13:18.597 --> 13:21.432
   They just need time to find
     the audience, you know?

13:21.534 --> 13:22.700
            The first
      season of "Seinfeld,"

13:22.802 --> 13:24.502
      not that many people
         saw that show,

13:24.603 --> 13:27.038
           but it got
          time to grow.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.240
                         Yeah.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.442
                      Oh, we got
                      a fan.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.344
                  We got a fan,
                  hey, hey, hey.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.715
     Me and Ilana, we really
    don't like to use labels.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.184
        We try to be more
          progressive.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.119
            We have a
        real connection.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.758
    Oh, she's break dancing,
          that's cool.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.495
All right,
let's pick it up.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.665
           Who teaches
      the bucket drummers?

13:53.766 --> 13:58.369
  I never seen a bucket drummer
     class listed anywhere.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.805
      (clapping, cheering)

14:02.708 --> 14:04.375
           She should be
           giving us, like, 25%.

14:05.778 --> 14:06.678
        We can't do this
            anymore.

14:06.779 --> 14:07.679
         This is insane.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.247
          We're like--
Where'd the music go?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.682
                    (crowd)
                    Boo!

14:10.783 --> 14:12.217
             Are you
           kidding me?

14:12.318 --> 14:14.319
   No-- She wouldn't even have
      anything to dance to

14:14.420 --> 14:15.587
      if it wasn't for us!

14:15.688 --> 14:16.955
                       (man)
                       You suck!

14:17.056 --> 14:18.857
                    What--
                    Shut up!

14:20.192 --> 14:21.426
           All right.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.062
        You come out and
    you try to do some good.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.864
Stop!

14:25.965 --> 14:27.065
            Grow up!

14:28.367 --> 14:31.035
     I just don't understand why
     she took the fishbowl.

14:31.136 --> 14:33.538
                I would have
                given it to her.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.274
Homeless people need supplies,
I don't know.
                         I know.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.843
And we need 90 bucks
in two hours

14:38.944 --> 14:41.045
and you need to
get stoned, I need your...
                90 bucks-- Okay.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.780

14:42.882 --> 14:44.115
       (phone vibrating)
      You know what, Ilana,
      I rag on you all the time,

14:44.216 --> 14:45.617
              but you're right,
              like, I needed to

14:45.718 --> 14:47.118
                  get out of my
                  element today.
Hello?

14:47.219 --> 14:48.653
                   I needed it.

14:50.756 --> 14:52.323
           It was nice of
           you to have my back--

14:52.424 --> 14:53.691
                         Jesus.

14:53.792 --> 14:54.859
               Thank you for
               this opportunity.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.895
             We'll see you in
             30 minutes or less.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.196
                  Bye-bye, sir.

14:58.297 --> 14:59.530
What?

14:59.632 --> 15:00.932
      Okay, I had a backup plan
      on the low this whole time

15:01.033 --> 15:02.767
             and it's coming up,
             it's happening.

15:02.868 --> 15:03.801
                 We are gonna
                 make this money

15:03.903 --> 15:05.403

              new piggy bank,

                        Come on.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.509
         Ilana, this is
        really good pot.

15:11.610 --> 15:12.510
It's PCP.

15:12.611 --> 15:13.511

             Yeah, we saw, dude.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.936
I hope I never see
this again.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.370
I don't
even know.

18:26.472 --> 18:27.772
   All right, all right, careful
   of the marbles.

18:27.873 --> 18:32.110
   So I'm gonna grab this,
   'cause babies don't like fur.

18:32.211 --> 18:33.144
             Are you my fwends?

18:33.245 --> 18:34.745
               No.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.814
         (phone ringing
         and vibrating)

18:39.685 --> 18:41.085
         This is David.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.858
     Is the flight delayed?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.126
               Was
       the flight delayed?

18:48.227 --> 18:51.362
      ¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶

18:51.463 --> 18:53.097
      ¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶

18:53.198 --> 18:54.332
Lil Wayne's so short, though,

18:54.433 --> 18:56.067
that we weren't even gonna
be able to see him

18:56.168 --> 18:57.969
from where
we would have sat.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.470
      I don't think I even would
      have recognized him.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.172
                I don't know
                who this guy is.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.275
You know, I read that he's
actually better pre-recorded.

19:04.376 --> 19:05.977
I just didn't want to say
anything 'cause I wanted to go.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.278
                   These spaces
                   are so small,

19:07.379 --> 19:10.014
      like, we would be so close
      to so many strangers

19:10.115 --> 19:11.115
                 we don't know.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.551
Drinks are, like, so
expensive and tiny, like--

19:13.652 --> 19:15.286
                     Oh, my God,
                     double...
Crap.

19:15.387 --> 19:17.455
      Do you know me, how I have
      to pee, like, constantly?

19:17.556 --> 19:19.157
      We would be standing
      in line the whole concert.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.093
        The whole time, we would
        be standing in a line.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.828
Ugh.

19:23.929 --> 19:26.497
Tomorrow's gonna be
the day, like, I know it,

19:26.598 --> 19:30.034
that we're gonna look back and
be like, that was the day!

19:30.135 --> 19:34.138
     I know that tomorrow...
     tomorrow's totally the day.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.673
          Like, I'm so confident
          in myself,

19:35.774 --> 19:37.308
                    I feel it
                    in my heart.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.410
            I'm confident myself
            in the day.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.379
Yes...
Yeah!

19:41.480 --> 19:42.580
                       I believe
                       in us.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.115
Hyah--
Yeah!

19:44.216 --> 19:47.952
                      Yes, dude!
Dude, I would follow you
into hell, brother.

19:48.053 --> 19:51.155
            I would take you on
            my shoulders, like,

19:51.256 --> 19:57.428
    I'd strap you up and I'd be
    like, let's go through hell.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.164
              Should we go to...
            Mm-hmm.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.532
                    the subway.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.802
We'll give you
some privacy.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.037
           (knocking)

20:08.140 --> 20:10.007
     Enjoy your office supplies,
     my friend.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.309
                  They even
                  have food now.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.443
                  Crazy, right?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.245
                  Okay...
                  Okay, cha-cha.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.282
                         Good.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.617
               Ah.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.421
             Please.

20:23.522 --> 20:24.622
            Help me.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.457
           Ay, mi amor,
           what happened to you?

20:28.660 --> 20:30.728
    (computer alert beeping)

20:30.829 --> 20:31.729
                      <i> Oh, yeah.</i>

20:31.830 --> 20:32.964
What the hell--
What is this?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.799
                 Oh,
                 it's happening.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.067
           (coughing)

20:36.168 --> 20:37.802
Why are we doing
this right now?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.103
             Hymes, you can go.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.271
                    She got me.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.473
<i>I don't got her--</i>
<i>I'm not there with you.</i>

20:42.574 --> 20:44.909
                  Leave me one,
                  leave me one.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.911
Okay.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.514
<i>Ilana, we drank</i>
<i>the same amount.</i>

20:50.616 --> 20:52.350
                  <i> I'm so sorry.</i>

20:52.451 --> 20:53.584
              <i> I always do this.</i>

20:53.685 --> 20:56.220
It's fine, everyone
has nights like this.

20:56.321 --> 20:57.321
Just, if you feel like
you're gonna throw up,

20:57.422 --> 20:58.589
just give
me a heads up.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.494
             You wanna come over
             and hang out?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.363
             We just got pizza.

21:05.464 --> 21:06.564
What kind?

21:07.305 --> 21:13.797
