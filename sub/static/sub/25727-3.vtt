WEBVTT

00:04.312 --> 00:06.589
Dean was free climbing with no harness.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.257
His fall was so hot.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.033
He held eye contact the whole way down.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.427
I felt like it was in slow motion.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.095
I was actually in fear of my life,

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
but still, like halfway down,

00:15.057 --> 00:17.183
I was able to pull off one of these.

00:17.184 --> 00:20.102
Oh, my God. Dean, I'm blown away.

00:20.103 --> 00:24.190
Uh, and I just want to be
the first person to ask you...

00:24.191 --> 00:26.901
Will. You. Do. My. Podcast?

00:26.902 --> 00:29.195
Let me give you 5 answers here, OK?
I would never do your podcast.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.905
I won't do your podcast. No way.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.531
Not gonna do your podcast. And...

00:32.531 --> 00:34.617
You pick. You pick any of those answers.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.410
The last one could have been anything.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.621
Be right back.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.957
Look, while I'm
out of commission, Benji,

00:40.958 --> 00:43.167
I'm gonna need you
to help out at the office, OK?

00:43.168 --> 00:46.629
I'm waiting on an international courier

00:46.630 --> 00:49.006
to deliver something
very, very important.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.007
Oh, OK, yeah!

00:50.008 --> 00:51.425
I want you to go in there.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.840
I want you to not talk to anyone.

00:52.851 --> 00:54.804
Keep your mouth shut. And I don't
want you to touch anything.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.430
And try not to bring shame
on our family.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.473
How 'bout that, man?

00:57.474 --> 00:58.474
I mean, I can not talk,

00:58.475 --> 01:00.309
but shame on the family?

01:00.310 --> 01:02.937
- That's a real stretch, don't you think?
- He can't pull that off.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.690
Babe, I'm going to Palm Springs
for the weekend.

01:05.691 --> 01:08.568
If you don't hear from me,
send me a DM on Instagram.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.319
OK, cool.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.698
- Take me out, babe!
- Yeah.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.368
I mean, Olivia may have
a perfect clavicle,

01:17.369 --> 01:19.787
but she's a crappy girlfriend, OK?

01:19.788 --> 01:22.832
You don't just leave someone
in their time of need.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.875
Now, I'm gonna be stuck
taking care of Dean.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.128
Such a classic Esther move.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.838
Tryin' to take advantage
of a broken man.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.464
You know, now that I think about it,

01:30.465 --> 01:32.466
I think every hot guy
you slept with had the flu.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.928
Please. I'm just gonna make
him soup, wash his bed sores.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.348
If we watch a movie, hold hands,
and fall in love, so be it.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.351
Really? And is that before or after you
break his legs with a sledgehammer?

01:42.352 --> 01:43.687
Oh, very funny.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.231
Hopefully before.

01:47.344 --> 01:49.797

01:53.697 --> 01:55.740
Oh! How can I help you?

01:55.741 --> 01:58.117
Uh, I'm Dean's brother.
I... I can't talk.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.180
Oh, I didn't know
Dean had a... brother...

02:05.792 --> 02:07.127
that's a bigger jerk than him.

02:09.795 --> 02:12.340
Oh. Pretty good bones.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.549
Delivery for Mr. Aflalo.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.384
- Hi.
- Ooh...

02:15.385 --> 02:17.219
Look, man, you don't have to be ashamed.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.509
Like, 95% of people at work
are looking at porn.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.035
I wasn't looking at porn.
I'm looking at houses up for auction.

02:22.046 --> 02:24.001
Even if I was looking at
porn, I'm porn-positive.

02:24.012 --> 02:25.647
- There's no shame in it.
- Sure.

02:25.658 --> 02:28.064
Sure. This is for you.
Uh, international package.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.024
What? It's from Vietnam.
I love their soup!

02:30.025 --> 02:32.401
- It's pronounced "fo" or "fuh"?
- I really don't know.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.111
'Cause there's two restaurants
by my house,

02:34.112 --> 02:36.405
and one's called, "What Have
You Done Pho Me Lately"

02:36.406 --> 02:38.407
and the other one's called,
"Phoget About It."

02:38.408 --> 02:40.993
I work two jobs, man.
Can you just sign, please?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.412
Yeah.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.081
Hey, Dean, are you decent?

02:45.082 --> 02:47.375
Yeah, you're supposed to
come into the room

02:47.376 --> 02:49.543
- after you ask that question.
- Oh.

02:49.544 --> 02:53.214
I brought you a little something
that helps me when I'm sick.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.722
"Miss Congeniality 2:
Armed and Dangerous."

02:55.733 --> 02:57.625
I haven't seen the first one,
so, you know what,

02:57.636 --> 02:59.428
- it's not gonna make sense.
- You do not need to see both.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.844
In fact, it... it's better
to watch the second one first.

03:01.855 --> 03:03.683
Please leave my room.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.686
I also brought you this.
It's a vuvuzela.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.938
They were very popular
during the World Cup.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.648
I won mine in a meat-eating contest

03:10.649 --> 03:12.483
at a Brazilian restaurant.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.611
It's very sensual.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.238
I don't want you to do that.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.365
I'm gonna leave it with you,
and just blow on it

03:19.366 --> 03:22.037
if you need anything
in this world at all.

03:22.048 --> 03:24.870
OK, so, then, if I don't blow on
it, you'll never come back again?

03:24.871 --> 03:26.747
Very silly, but my rules are:

03:26.748 --> 03:29.417
Blow once for water,
twice for bathroom help,

03:29.418 --> 03:31.336
three times for an emergency,
and four times,

03:31.347 --> 03:33.452
I'll just go ahead and assume
you're watching soccer.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.840
I'll see ya later!

03:35.841 --> 03:36.842
That's all I needed.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.889
Why are you walking
like you're squashing bugs?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.892
OK, sorry.

03:47.644 --> 03:51.021
Oh! I'm sorry, Benji,
but visiting hours are over.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.150
Why do you look and smell
like a man with a job?

03:54.151 --> 03:56.318
I'm an international businessman. <i>Scusi.</i>

03:56.319 --> 03:58.320
Let him in and go home!

03:58.321 --> 04:00.949
You have 15 minutes. He's really tired.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.244
Hey, Benj, look who
came through, all right!

04:06.746 --> 04:09.832
See? I'm embarrassing,
but not always embarrassing.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.723
How's it feel to trust
your brother? Feel good?

04:11.734 --> 04:14.333
Pretty soon, I'll be drinkin'
out of your boob mug from Cabo,

04:14.344 --> 04:15.861
- am I right?
- I don't know, man.

04:15.872 --> 04:17.515
That was hand-painted.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.134
Also, I saw some of the houses

04:20.135 --> 04:21.886
you have up for auction, and...

04:21.887 --> 04:23.929
I'd be glad to help out, if you want.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.639
- Oh, hell yeah!
- Really?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.100
Oh, aren't these sick?

04:28.101 --> 04:32.229
You... you had me go all the way to
your office just to pick up shoes?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.689
These aren't just shoes.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.568
These are 2011 Air Jordan
West All-Star Team Editions.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.361
What did you think this was?

04:39.362 --> 04:41.113
I don't know. I thought I was doing

04:41.114 --> 04:45.655
important international
business-y... business.

04:45.666 --> 04:47.495
Man, you're not ready
for real responsibility.

04:47.496 --> 04:51.123
I watched you and Esther
build a fort yesterday.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.459
I get real estate stuff.
I'm in this family, too.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.136
Sometimes, Dad talked to me. A little.

04:56.147 --> 04:57.922
OK, well, you know what,
actually, tomorrow,

04:57.923 --> 04:59.537
I do need you to go run by the office.

04:59.548 --> 05:01.625
I need you to pick up
two pairs of shoes for me.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.221
If you really need me
to just be your errand boy,

05:05.222 --> 05:07.973
I'll do it, but, for the record,

05:07.974 --> 05:09.391
the fort had a skylight.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.568
Who cares, it had a skylight?

05:10.579 --> 05:12.436
And also, Esther barely helped.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.522
Oh, it was mostly you
that made the fort?

05:14.523 --> 05:16.441
That's more sad.
You just made it more sad.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.780
 Benji, you need to be quiet, OK?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.615
What if Dean calls?

05:24.616 --> 05:26.784
You know, I should just
go check on him now.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.787
He doesn't need you.
He doesn't need either of us.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.872
We're like packing snow pants to Hawaii.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.833
OK, but, you know what
I'm just now realizing,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.703
is that the vuvuzela could be broken...

05:35.714 --> 05:38.075
Esther, those things are made
to last through a soccer riot.

05:38.086 --> 05:40.004
You could kill
an innocent Spaniard with one

05:40.015 --> 05:41.590
and it would still work.
I don't think he's calling you.

05:41.591 --> 05:45.219
OK, but, you know, if Dean
doesn't want me at his lowest,

05:45.220 --> 05:49.390
then he may never want me,
and I may need to face the fact

05:49.391 --> 05:51.836
that he may never get me
accidentally pregnant.

05:51.847 --> 05:53.109
Esther, was that on the table?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.406
My really good-looking, tall
brother getting you pregnant?

05:55.417 --> 05:59.525
- I don't remember hearing that.
- I mean... it was on my table.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.820
I'll get it.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.157
- Olivia.
- Hey, is Dean up?

06:07.158 --> 06:08.951
My plans got cancelled.
I'm gonna let him

06:08.952 --> 06:11.245
eat this nigiri off me
while we watch a movie.

06:11.246 --> 06:15.040
Um... yeah. Uh, come on in.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.584
Wait!

06:16.585 --> 06:19.461
Actually, I forgot for a second.

06:19.462 --> 06:23.007
Dean... died.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.342
We're all really sad,
and we're in the middle

06:25.343 --> 06:27.469
of a Brazilian death ritual.
So I have to go.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.682
Great to see you. Bye!

06:38.648 --> 06:40.065
Why are you wearing my hair net?

06:40.066 --> 06:42.026
I'm making table-side lemonade for Dean,

06:42.027 --> 06:46.322
and it's gonna be... a little
bit sour, a little bit sweet,

06:46.323 --> 06:49.617
and a little bit... sexy!

06:49.618 --> 06:51.160
My brother does not want you help.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.537
What you don't know, is that yesterday,

06:53.538 --> 06:56.165
Dean needed me to change the
batteries in his remote,

06:56.166 --> 07:00.210
and who had AA batteries
just in their purse?

07:00.211 --> 07:03.213
Little old future
perfect wife and mother, me.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.049
Did you use your
purse vibrator batteries?

07:05.050 --> 07:06.550
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- 'Cause I don't think

07:06.551 --> 07:08.552
there's anything else in your purse
that needs batteries.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.180
Why do you look and smell
like you've been doing you-know-what?

07:11.181 --> 07:12.278
I mean, come on, man.

07:12.289 --> 07:14.294
The only thing worse
than being an adult errand boy

07:14.305 --> 07:16.758
is being an adult errand boy who
actually tries. So yes, I got high.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.784
- Big deal.
- I didn't want to have to do this,

07:18.795 --> 07:20.847
but I'm gonna have to go
tell Dean that you're high.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.608
You know what?
I'm gonna have to tell Dean

07:22.609 --> 07:24.319
that you told Olivia he was dead.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.196
Never mind! Have a great day!

07:27.197 --> 07:29.157
Yeah. You too.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:38.958 --> 07:41.502
- What?
- Dean. Hi.

07:41.503 --> 07:45.297
Um, you may be noticing
that one of my many talents

07:45.298 --> 07:47.716
is squeezing lemons performatively.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.087
Ah! Come on.

07:49.098 --> 07:50.683
Sorry. I am sorry about that.

07:52.497 --> 07:55.438
Whoa! Whoa! Dean, what are you doing?

07:55.449 --> 07:57.591
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Argh! That's bone-on-bone.

07:58.937 --> 08:02.606
OK, that's what happens
when you try to escape me.

08:02.607 --> 08:06.026
I just... got a little
ahead of myself, I guess.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.904
I'm gonna leave you alone, OK?

08:08.905 --> 08:09.906
Hey.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.036
OK, I'll have some of that lemonade.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.960
OK, there you go.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.755
- Is it good? -No, it
tastes like guacamole.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.591
Oh, I forgot to wash
the mortar and pestle.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.009
That's so gross!

08:31.010 --> 08:33.554
Well, it's... California style.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.014
 But if they're not askin',

08:36.015 --> 08:38.558
- I'm not tellin', you know?
- That's not even...

08:38.559 --> 08:41.854
- Oh! I'm...
- Oh. Dean's brother.

08:41.855 --> 08:42.897
Didn't see ya there.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.400
- My bad! I was just...
- dealin' with this shark right now.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.985
You got a big deal cookin' up?

08:47.986 --> 08:50.321
We don't have to small talk.
None of this shit matters.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.990
Love ya.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.618
Three point five million,
I'm the man! Yes!

08:57.662 --> 09:00.748
Oh. He just closed a $3.5
million deal before lunch.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.210
OK, a three point five sell
pre-Cobb salad, that's insane.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.798
What? Who the hell are you?

09:09.799 --> 09:11.300
- Where's Dean?
- Um...

09:11.301 --> 09:13.761
I... I can handle
one question at a time.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.263
Well, answer this one question,
you little turd.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.016
My house, which I'm about to close on,

09:19.017 --> 09:20.976
is now going to someone else.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.187
Wow, I'm... I'm sorry, man. That sucks.

09:23.188 --> 09:26.149
Your buddy Dean said it was a done deal.

09:26.160 --> 09:29.078
What do you want a house in L. A.
For, anyways? We're on a fault line.

09:29.089 --> 09:30.694
We're just an ocean waiting to happen.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.696
OK, your level of calmness
is not correct

09:32.697 --> 09:34.829
for the amount of anger
that I'm directing at you.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.482
I mean, my dad's Middle Eastern,
I grew up around a lot of yelling.

09:37.493 --> 09:38.827
It just goes right through me.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.746
You gotta throw a lamp
if you really want to get

09:40.747 --> 09:42.118
a reaction out of me.

09:42.129 --> 09:44.041
I think I get you.
You're a straight-shooter.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.251
Not like Dean, who talks out of
both sides of his ass.

09:46.327 --> 09:48.203
You know, he could learn
a thing or two from you.

09:48.214 --> 09:50.717
Yeah, pretty boys don't
learn that well, you know?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.886
Did he just talk down Mr. Sears?

09:55.887 --> 09:57.764
I think he might be
Dean's secret weapon.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.686
Dean, what an incredible
strong, loud toot.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.897
- Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.441
My straw has a hole in it,
so I can't drink my smoothie.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.590
Look. I get nothing but air. See?

10:11.601 --> 10:13.636
So how could everything be OK
if that's happening?

10:13.647 --> 10:16.115
OK. Somebody sounds a little bit grumpy.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.868
- I'm not grumpy. I'm real. -Well, I
think maybe it's time for lunch.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.162
What's that?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.475
It's an ice cube.

10:23.486 --> 10:25.206
I put them in there
because I have actually

10:25.217 --> 10:26.875
burned several layers of my soft palate,

10:26.876 --> 10:29.086
and I do not want
to let that happen to you.

10:31.766 --> 10:34.675
I actually cooked the carrots longer
than I cooked the rest of the can,

10:34.676 --> 10:36.426
because carrots can be a choking hazard.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.721
Dean, did you hear
what I said about the carrots?

10:39.722 --> 10:43.058
Hey, who do you think's hotter,
Olivia H. Or Olivia R.?

10:43.059 --> 10:44.852
Why don't we take a break
from screen time?

10:44.863 --> 10:46.270
Oh, come on, I need that.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.148
- No.
- Come on, I'm bored.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.276
Let's just... here, let's watch this.

10:52.277 --> 10:55.696
Oh, my God. "Miss Congeniality 2"?

10:55.697 --> 10:57.948
Yeah, let's watch a movie. OK.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.625
Soup time's over. I'll be right back.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.080
Hey, budd... hey!

11:04.091 --> 11:05.873
What are you doin'?
These are pumps, man.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.834
- You could break the chamber like that.
- I don't care about shoes, man.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.794
I just saved your biggest client.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.088
That old guy, yells a lot,
grumpy and stuff?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.716
- Mr. Sears?
- He was about to fire you,

11:15.717 --> 11:18.844
and then I stepped in,
saved the day, charmed 'im.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.500
You got me playin' waterboy, dude!

11:20.511 --> 11:22.514
I should be out there getting
concussions like everyone else.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.683
No, dude. You pulled
a hamstring playing Twister.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.186
You're not ready to go out in the
field, OK? Trust me.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.521
Oh, really? Look.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.981
I went through your computer.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.399
I found a house up for auction

11:32.400 --> 11:33.984
better than the one you're lookin' at.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.736
Yeah, this is...
I mean, this house is OK.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.696
It's good. It's not bad.
But, look, I'm lookin'

11:37.697 --> 11:40.490
at a house that's in a neighborhood
that's gentrifying hard.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.992
I know that neighborhood really well.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.535
It's been gentrifying for years.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.080
I was eating cauliflower pizza
there in like, 2013.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.416
This is the house I'm lookin' at.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.421
And I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do.
Mainly because I'm laid up here.

11:52.432 --> 11:53.712
You're gonna go to auction and try

11:53.713 --> 11:55.099
and snatch this house
up for me, how 'bout that?

11:55.110 --> 11:56.111
Really?

11:57.759 --> 12:00.263
I'm gonna kill it, dude.
I'm not gonna mess up.

12:00.274 --> 12:02.346
I've been wanting to do this
for a while. Thank you!

12:02.347 --> 12:04.692
- No problem.
- I'm not gonna let you down!

12:04.703 --> 12:05.808
Step aside.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.935
It's "Miss Congeniality 2"...

12:07.936 --> 12:09.312
o'clock.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.149
How'd you change your makeup so fast?
What do you got, a stencil?

12:14.150 --> 12:17.236
I've been experimenting with a
smoky eye, and you need to leave.

12:23.584 --> 12:26.078
A lot of people tell me that I
should have been an FBI agent.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.704
That I missed my calling.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.165
I almost took the test once.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.584
You would be so great.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.630
I could really see you rescuing me
from a murderer's basement dungeon,

12:36.631 --> 12:39.217
and then, like, holding me
while I shiver.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.376
Ow, it's all kernel-y.

12:45.387 --> 12:47.435
What is this? There's like,
no... It's all seeds.

12:47.446 --> 12:48.817
You don't need to eat the popcorn.

12:48.828 --> 12:50.732
No, I can't eat the popcorn,
is what I'm saying.

12:50.743 --> 12:52.537
It's all seeds. What do I have, a beak?

12:53.395 --> 12:55.399
Well, you could just take from the top,

12:55.400 --> 12:56.915
because the seeds are at the bottom.

12:56.926 --> 12:58.857
So you don't have to
scrounge in there for them.

12:58.868 --> 13:00.435
My point is, is that you should be able

13:00.446 --> 13:03.991
to grab any of the popcorn
wherever I put my hand,

13:03.992 --> 13:05.909
and... grab popcorn.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.996
I... I don't understand
what's happening right now.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.403
Every single bowl of popcorn
in human history

13:11.414 --> 13:13.375
has always had a seed bed,
so I don't know how...

13:13.376 --> 13:15.168
- Not in movie theaters.
- Yes.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.504
Have you ever looked in a movie
theater popcorn machine?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.881
There's a giant fluffy top,
and then at the bottom,

13:19.882 --> 13:21.842
there's a wall-to-wall seed bed.

13:21.843 --> 13:25.637
OK, so that's a good idea.
I'm gonna go to a movie theater

13:25.638 --> 13:29.057
and stick my head in a movie
theater popcorn machine.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.476
- Well...
- And not be a crazy person.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.061
Nobody said stick your head in it.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.314
- I just said, "Look in it"...
- You were insinuating it.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.317
You were insinuating for me
to stick my head in a popcorn machine.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.458
Look, just...
this is the makeover montage,

13:41.469 --> 13:43.447
so, can you just...?

13:43.448 --> 13:44.948
I need to make over this popcorn,

13:44.949 --> 13:47.034
- is what we need to make over.
- No, we don't.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.828
Benji, Benji, Benji!

13:50.621 --> 13:52.622
Oh, it's you!

13:52.623 --> 13:55.167
Guess who's goin'
to the auction for Dean?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.794
I'm lubricating my throat.
This is what George Harrison did

13:57.795 --> 13:59.254
for the Concert for Bangladesh.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.480
It's how he sings forever.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.591
It's partially the cocaine
that gives you the endurance,

14:02.592 --> 14:04.301
but that also hurts your throat, so...

14:04.302 --> 14:07.262
Benji! Stop talking!
I'm having a crisis!

14:07.263 --> 14:10.015
I was just in bed with Dean,

14:10.016 --> 14:12.934
and we were holding hands
watching my favorite movie,

14:12.935 --> 14:15.520
like, basically, in a solid pre-cuddle,

14:15.521 --> 14:19.733
and I didn't like it.
In fact, I found it annoying.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.318
What is with this popcorn?

14:21.319 --> 14:23.195
Look at kernel-y that is!

14:23.196 --> 14:24.613
What am I, one of Darwin's finches?

14:24.614 --> 14:26.198
How am I gonna eat those kernels?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.533
It's not kernels.
Just take from the fluffy top.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.078
There's no problem. It's just...

14:31.954 --> 14:35.415
Oh, my God. Broken Dean isn't hot,

14:35.416 --> 14:37.751
because Broken Dean is <i>you.</i>

14:39.087 --> 14:43.925
Ew! Ew! No! No, no, no, no, no!

14:50.932 --> 14:54.768
Olivia! Hey, great news. Dean's alive.

14:54.769 --> 14:58.105
Yeah. No, I know. There was
a mix-up at the morgue.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.481
Happens more thank you think.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.983
Sure. Um...

15:01.984 --> 15:06.655
He's been asking for you, so...
Oh, you're in Mexico?

15:06.656 --> 15:08.490
OK.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.158
You... you're not coming?

15:10.159 --> 15:13.036
Yeah, no, sure, I'll tell Dean
you think it's turnt he's still alive.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.038
Great. Thanks so much. Bye.

15:15.039 --> 15:18.209
Dean, you're abusing the toot system!

15:19.752 --> 15:21.586
Here's your lemonade.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.839
- Why is it all gloppy?
- Dean, what do you want from me?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.508
Actually, I want the humidifier
in Benji's room.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.263
All right, the corner of my lip
is startin' to crack.

15:28.274 --> 15:30.554
OK. Coming right up.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.931
Thank you.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.935
Benji.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.648
Dean, I'm here. I'm sort of overdressed.

15:38.659 --> 15:40.355
Everyone looks like they work
at a truck stop.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.190
Well, don't underestimate them,
because they each

15:42.191 --> 15:44.151
have enough cash in their pocket
to get Nic Cage out of debt.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.403
Next property up is Marion Court.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.698
We'll start bidding at $450,000.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.973
Game face.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.659
<i>Your face didn't change at all, did it?</i>

15:52.660 --> 15:53.994
- No.
- I knew it.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.121
- Four-fifty!
- Four-fifty.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.875
I've got four hundred and fifty.
Any further bidders?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.459
Going once.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.711
Going twice.

16:02.712 --> 16:03.712
<i>We're lookin' good, Dean.</i>

16:03.713 --> 16:06.173
I shoulda brought a lawn chair,
but we are lookin' good.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.133
- Five hundred!
- <i>Yo, what's going on?</i>

16:08.134 --> 16:11.053
There's people from your office bidding.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.055
I just waved at them. That felt weird.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.683
Why did I do that? I shoulda
done a throat-cutting motion.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.185
Five hundred, going twice!

16:18.186 --> 16:20.520
Bid, bid, bid, bid!
But six hundred is our max.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.189
- Five-fifty!
- Five-seventy!

16:22.190 --> 16:23.982
- Five-eighty!
- Five-ninety!

16:23.983 --> 16:25.984
Six hundred!

16:25.985 --> 16:28.195
Six-fifty.

16:28.196 --> 16:32.490
Going once... twice.
This property is sold.

16:34.553 --> 16:36.411
Dean, are you sitting down?
We lost the house.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.829
I know you're sitting down.
That was a dumb question.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.248
- No, you have to get that house.
- I don't know what you want from me!

16:40.249 --> 16:42.000
I did everything you told me to do!

16:42.001 --> 16:43.710
<i>I took enough ADD medicine
to kill a horse.</i>

16:43.711 --> 16:45.670
Hey, little guy.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.048
- Hi.
- Sorry we took your house.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.258
You guys don't seem sorry.
You're saying "sorry,"

16:50.259 --> 16:51.801
- but your face doesn't seem sorry.
- The secret's out.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.803
You're the brains behind
Dean's little operation.

16:53.804 --> 16:57.098
Any house you bid on has gotta
be worth more than market.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.392
You got prop-blocked, sucka.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.145
Later.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.231
Dean, I think we lost the house

17:04.232 --> 17:05.982
'cause everyone at your office
thinks I'm a genius.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.483
I knew you'd bring shame on our family.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.984
I think all we gotta do to fix this

17:08.986 --> 17:10.779
is just buy that house I told you about.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.265
No, do not buy that house!

17:12.276 --> 17:13.949
I can't hear you. There's, like,
construction or something.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.249
- Can you hear me?
- Hello?

17:15.260 --> 17:17.327
It's a cheap Bluetooth.
I got it on Canal Street.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.744
Two-for-one with a stun gun. Hello?

17:18.746 --> 17:21.039
Hey! Oh, come on!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
Damn it.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.960
Do not throw things at me, Dean.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.753
I am already covered in
sloshed-out humidifier water.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.339
Dude, Benji's gone rogue, all right?

17:29.340 --> 17:30.590
I need to call somebody at the office

17:30.591 --> 17:32.133
to figure this out. Give me my phone!

17:32.134 --> 17:33.260
- No.
- Yes.

17:33.261 --> 17:36.179
No!

17:37.974 --> 17:39.766
I need my phone!

17:39.767 --> 17:41.185
Too bad!

17:42.645 --> 17:45.605
- That was your idea!
- I can't take it anymore, Dean.

17:45.606 --> 17:49.192
This isn't you. This is not
the Dean I fell in love with.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.736
I thought I wanted Broken Dean,
but I don't! I take it back!

17:51.737 --> 17:53.154
Get yourself together,

17:53.155 --> 17:55.156
wipe the soup crust
off your chin right here,

17:55.157 --> 17:57.325
and go to the auction yourself!

17:57.326 --> 17:59.995
- But I'm injured! -I don't
care that you're injured.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.581
Benji is out in the world
doing your business for you

18:02.582 --> 18:04.332
while you're sitting here breathing in

18:04.333 --> 18:07.460
his humidifier algae.
Is that what you want?

18:07.461 --> 18:09.087
Did you seriously not clean that?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.131
We both know I didn't clean it, Dean.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.341
Get your ass out of bed <i>now.</i>

18:13.342 --> 18:16.136
Do you know how to drive a seven
speed dual clutch transmission?

18:16.137 --> 18:18.222
I absolutely do not. Let's go.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.689
I don't know how we got here!

18:27.690 --> 18:30.483
I don't even think I touched the wheel.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.193
Dude, you're a dead man.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.612
I didn't buy wave runners and blow

18:33.613 --> 18:35.196
with your cashiers checks, just relax.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.595
I want you to look at this house.

18:36.606 --> 18:38.867
I'm telling you, the price is
better than the other one,

18:38.868 --> 18:41.036
and it's a block closer to Whole Foods.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.288
Yeah, it's a good deal. But
we're gonna have to bid on it

18:43.289 --> 18:45.332
without those parasites
knowing that we're doing it.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.042
OK, well...

18:47.043 --> 18:49.961
Maybe I can wear a fake mustache
and then, I can bid, or...

18:49.962 --> 18:51.838
Or Esther, you can do
a smoky eye for me...

18:51.839 --> 18:53.757
- What?
- A smoky eye and a mustache?

18:53.758 --> 18:55.842
- Oh, yeah. Both. That'd be a great idea.
- No, that's not a good idea.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.010
What are you, a Kardashian?

18:57.011 --> 18:58.316
He can't pull off Kardashian.

18:58.327 --> 19:00.013
Oh, no, wait, shut up.
Hold on one second.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.849
- We're gonna use Esther.
- Me?

19:02.850 --> 19:05.185
You guys wanna use me? Are you serious?

19:05.186 --> 19:07.187
- Yes.
- OK.

19:07.188 --> 19:10.482
- Just say numbers.
- OK.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.777
Next up, the property
at 770 Springvale Drive.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.447
We'll start the bidding at $440,000.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.784
Four-forty, please. Yeah?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.746
Going once.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.124
Oh, my God. Am I about to win?

19:28.125 --> 19:32.587
Twice! Being no further bids,
this property is sold!

19:34.215 --> 19:35.799
To the woman doing ballet.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.427
I won! I won! I won!

19:39.428 --> 19:41.389
You said a number.
Let's not get carried away.

19:45.269 --> 19:47.933
How do you let her drive the car?
You never let me drive the car.

19:47.944 --> 19:50.436
Maybe because you don't know
how to drive a six transmission

19:50.447 --> 19:51.670
seven clutch red car.

19:51.681 --> 19:53.206
You know, I hate to admit it, but...

19:53.217 --> 19:54.717
wasn't a bad deal.

19:54.718 --> 19:56.218
You guys did a good job.

19:56.219 --> 19:57.595
Here's your paperwork.

19:57.596 --> 20:00.222
Let me know if you need a guy
for the blood stains on the carpets.

20:00.223 --> 20:02.016
- Wait, what?
- It's a murder house.

20:02.017 --> 20:04.727
Some woman got
bludgeoned to death there.

20:04.728 --> 20:07.814
Good luck if you're tryin'
to re-sell it. Enjoy!

20:09.065 --> 20:10.399
I had no idea.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.068
I bought a murder house?

20:13.069 --> 20:15.029
I mean, I know it was the violent end

20:15.030 --> 20:16.489
to someone else's life, but...

20:16.490 --> 20:19.408
it's the best day of mine! Ha-ha!

20:19.409 --> 20:20.868
You know what else
there's a good thing to find out

20:20.869 --> 20:22.343
before you purchase a house?

20:22.354 --> 20:25.623
Is whether or not
someone was murdered in it.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.605
Maybe I just go back
to picking up shoes for you,

20:27.616 --> 20:29.015
and then work my way back up?

20:29.026 --> 20:30.863
I was crushing it
with your shoes, remember that?

20:30.874 --> 20:32.796
It was shoe after shoe
after shoe with me.

20:32.797 --> 20:34.632
Looks like I'm the little brother now.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.590
You're not his little brother.
I'm his little brother!

20:36.601 --> 20:39.379
- No. She's my little brother now.
- She is not your little brother!

20:39.390 --> 20:41.096
Can't be wife, I'll take little brother.

20:41.097 --> 20:43.098
Peel out, lil' bro.
