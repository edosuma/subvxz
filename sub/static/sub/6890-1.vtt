02:16.928 --> 02:18.887
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.806
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Mr. Washington.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.433
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.566
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

02:32.068 --> 02:35.904
- Morning, Bancini.
- Good morning.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.788
How you feel?

02:45.415 --> 02:47.457
Rested.

03:03.308 --> 03:07.769
<i>Medication time. Medication time.</i>

03:32.462 --> 03:34.421
Okay, move it up.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.675
Mr. Fredrickson, just be careful now.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.441
Juice.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.156
Chief.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.835
Okay, my friend, let's go.

04:34.357 --> 04:38.568
Here's his papers,
and I'm gonna need a signature.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.722
Whoo!

05:34.584 --> 05:36.251
Hi.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.467
- Mr. McMurphy's here.
- All right.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.972
Thank you.

05:59.275 --> 06:03.445
- All right, I'm ready.
- Okay. One pair of socks.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.948
T-shirt.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.206
Hi.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.003
Goddamn, boy, you're about
as big as a mountain.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.714
Look like you might have played
some football.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.549
What's your name?

06:24.717 --> 06:30.764
He-- He can't hear you.
He's de-- Deaf and dumb Indian.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.475
Is that so?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.185
Come on, Bibbit.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.146
Can't even make a sound, huh?

06:39.524 --> 06:40.816
How.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.159
Come on, Billy.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.161
Club lead. Jack of clubs.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.914
Ha, ha. Uh-oh.

06:58.167 --> 07:01.294
- What's your name, son?
- Bill-- Billy Bibbit.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.339
Glad to know you, Bill.
McMurphy's mine.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.968
Ha-ha-ha.
That's old Charlie Cheswick's cards.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.513
- Ha-ha.
- That's his ace of spades.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.849
Your turn, Bill.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.684
Big 10.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.980
- Put one of them on it, will you?
- Wait a minute.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.278
Oh, I can win that one.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.863
- I win.
- Oh, you overtrumped?

07:28.030 --> 07:29.239
- Sure.
- Pinochle, huh, Bill?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.241
- You're avoiding spades?
- Mm-hm.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.495
- Oh, okay. You sure you're avoiding spades?
- What's the bid?

07:35.705 --> 07:38.915
- I know how to play the game.
- Five-- Five-fifty.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.672
Oh, uh, you like to look
at other people's cards, do you?

07:45.840 --> 07:49.718
- Yes.
- Ever seen this one?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.728
- Come on, Martini.
- Martini.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.190
Martini, will you--?
Will you play a club?

08:07.945 --> 08:09.488
Whose turn is it now?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.032
Well, let's see, he trumped.
Where you going?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.576
- Aren't you gonna play?
- What's the matter with him?

08:14.744 --> 08:17.078
- Aren't you gonna play, Martini?
- What's--?

08:17.246 --> 08:20.832
- Martini? I wanna play.
- You took a trump. You got-- It's your lead.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.337
Billy? Billy, I wanna win some... I...

08:25.505 --> 08:27.672
Get a grip on yourself, will you?

08:30.885 --> 08:32.302
Yes?

08:33.261 --> 08:37.057
- Mr. McMurphy's here, doc.
- Good, have him come in.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.020
Thank you.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.272
McMurphy, I'm Dr. Spivey.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.566
Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.945
- Sure. Pull up a chair, sit down, let's talk.
- Sure.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.874
R.P. McMurphy.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.960
That's a hell of a fish there, doc.

09:05.127 --> 09:08.713
- Isn't that a dandy?
- Yeah. It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?

09:08.881 --> 09:10.757
- No, 32.
- Thirty-two.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.343
I'll tell you,
it took every bit of strength I had...

09:13.511 --> 09:15.595
to hold it while the guy
took the picture.

09:15.763 --> 09:16.805
Every damn bit.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.683
Probably that chain
didn't help it any either.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.893
You didn't weigh the chain,
did you, doc?

09:22.061 --> 09:25.772
No, I didn't weigh the chain, but damn,
I'm awful proud of that picture.

09:25.940 --> 09:29.317
That's the first Chinooker
I ever caught.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.778
- It's a nice one.
- Hmm.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.911
Randall Patrick McMurphy.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.289
Thirty-eight years old.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.461
Mm.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.841
What can you tell me about, uh...

09:53.009 --> 09:54.801
why you've been sent over here?

09:57.054 --> 10:00.599
Well, ahem, I don't know.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.018
What's it say there?

10:03.394 --> 10:05.770
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, go right ahead.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.107
Well, it, um...

10:09.275 --> 10:11.359
says several things here.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.531
Said you've been belligerent...

10:17.199 --> 10:20.035
talked when unauthorized...

10:20.202 --> 10:24.873
you've been resentful in attitude
toward work in general, that you're lazy.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.667
Chewing gum in class.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.882
Well, the real reason
you've been sent over here...

10:34.050 --> 10:36.760
is because they wanted you
to be evaluated.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.511
- Yeah.
- To determine whether or not...

10:38.679 --> 10:40.055
you're mentally ill.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.557
- Uh-huh.
- This is the real reason.

10:42.725 --> 10:46.061
Why do you think
they might think that?

10:48.230 --> 10:51.900
Well, as near as I can figure out,
it's because I, uh...

10:52.068 --> 10:54.903
Uh, fight and fuck too much.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.404
In the penitentiary?

10:56.572 --> 10:58.198
No, no, no, you mean why--
Wait--

10:58.366 --> 11:01.910
Why did you get sent over here
from the work farm?

11:02.078 --> 11:04.829
Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh. Uh...

11:04.997 --> 11:08.333
Well, I really don't know, doc.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.502
It says here that you went around--

11:10.670 --> 11:13.338
- Let me just take a look.
- It ain't up to me, you know.

11:13.506 --> 11:19.427
One, two, three, four...

11:19.595 --> 11:25.266
- You've got at least five arrests for assault.
- Yeah.

11:25.434 --> 11:29.104
- What can you tell me about that?
- Five fights, huh?

11:29.355 --> 11:33.400
Rocky Marciano's got 40,
and he's a millionaire.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.319
- That's true.
- That is true.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.282
Of course, it's true that you went in
for statutory rape.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.326
That's true, is it not, this time?

11:43.494 --> 11:46.329
Absolutely true. But, doc...

11:47.081 --> 11:50.291
she was 15 years old 
going on 35, doc...

11:50.459 --> 11:53.628
and, uh, she told me she was 18, 
and she was...

11:53.796 --> 11:55.505
uh, very willing.
You know what I mean?

11:55.673 --> 11:57.465
- Mm. Mm.
- I practically had to take...

11:57.633 --> 11:59.759
to sewing my pants shut.

11:59.927 --> 12:04.097
But, uh, between you and me, uh...

12:05.141 --> 12:08.393
she might have been 15.
When you get that little red beaver...

12:08.561 --> 12:11.646
right up there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at all.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.649
- And I don't think you do either.
- I hear what you're saying.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.695
No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.989
Now they're telling me
I'm crazy over here...

12:21.157 --> 12:23.658
because I don't sit there
like a goddamn vegetable.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.827
It don't make a bit of sense to me.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.912
If that's what being crazy is...

12:28.080 --> 12:31.708
then I'm senseless, out of it,
gone down the road, wacko.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.335
But no more, no less. 
That's it.

12:34.503 --> 12:40.592
Well, to be honest with you,
McMurphy, what it says here...

12:42.970 --> 12:44.637
is that...

12:45.347 --> 12:46.806
they think...

12:47.349 --> 12:49.058
They think...

12:49.226 --> 12:53.813
you've been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail.

12:54.356 --> 12:58.902
- What do you think about that?
- Do I look like that kind of guy to you, doc?

12:59.069 --> 13:01.029
Well...

13:01.614 --> 13:06.034
Let's just be frank for a minute,
Randall, if you would.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.827
Tell me...

13:07.995 --> 13:12.123
do you think there's anything wrong 
with your mind, really?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.709
Not a thing, doc.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.378
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.

13:20.716 --> 13:26.054
Well, you're gonna be here for a period
for us to evaluate you.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.015
- We're gonna study you.
- Mm-hm.

13:29.183 --> 13:33.228
We'll make our determinations
as to what, uh, we're going to do...

13:33.395 --> 13:36.147
and give you
the necessary treatment, uh...

13:36.482 --> 13:38.775
- as indicated--
- Doc, let me just tell you this.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.362
I'm here to cooperate with you 100 percent.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.988
A hundred percent.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.991
I'll be just right down
the line with you. You watch.

13:47.326 --> 13:53.748
Because I think we ought to get
to the bottom of, uh, R.P. McMurphy.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.387
Whoo!

14:07.555 --> 14:09.722
The scythe.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.645
- Oh.
- I'm awfully tired.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.564
- Sit down.
- I'm tired.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.732
Well, sit down.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.110
Oh.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.278
That better?

14:34.164 --> 14:36.457
Mr. Ellsworth...

14:36.792 --> 14:39.294
you'll wear yourself out.
Come here.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.462
Okay.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.300
All right, gentlemen, let's begin.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.512
At the close of Friday's meeting...

14:49.680 --> 14:53.641
we were discussing Mr. Harding's problem 
concerning his wife.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.271
Mr. Harding stated that his wife
made him uneasy...

14:58.439 --> 15:01.983
because she drew stares
from men on the street.

15:02.151 --> 15:08.239
- Is that correct, Mr. Harding?
- Yes. Uh, yes. That's correct.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.118
He also thinks he may have
given her reason...

15:12.286 --> 15:17.123
to seek sexual attention elsewhere,
but he wasn't able to say how.

15:19.001 --> 15:22.170
Mr. Harding has been heard
to say to his wife:

15:22.338 --> 15:26.090
"I hate you.
I don't ever want to see you again.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.343
You've betrayed me."

15:29.595 --> 15:33.848
So does anyone care
to touch on this further?

15:49.657 --> 15:54.077
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?

15:56.205 --> 15:58.373
Are you sure?

16:03.504 --> 16:04.879
Billy, how about you?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.884
No-- No-- No, ma'am.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.805
I'd like to write in my book
that you began the meeting.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.016
Just once.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.698
Mr. Martini?

16:33.909 --> 16:35.201
Are you with us?

16:37.204 --> 16:38.746
Yes.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.291
Would you like to begin?

16:52.344 --> 16:54.429
Mr. Cheswick?

17:03.605 --> 17:06.315
- Me?
- Yes.

17:11.446 --> 17:15.950
You mean there's not a man here
who has an opinion on this matter?

17:19.954 --> 17:21.873
All right.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.708
Mr. Harding...

17:24.167 --> 17:26.252
you've stated
on more than one occasion...

17:26.420 --> 17:29.130
that you suspected your wife
of seeing other men.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.717
Oh, yes. Yes, very much--
I suspect her.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.218
I suspect her.

17:34.845 --> 17:39.474
Well, maybe you can tell us 
why you suspect her.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.521
Well, I can only...

17:45.689 --> 17:48.149
speculate as to the reasons why.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.279
Have you ever speculated, Mr. Harding...

17:53.447 --> 17:55.698
that perhaps you are...

17:55.866 --> 17:57.283
impatient with your wife...

17:57.451 --> 18:01.287
because she doesn't meet
your mental requirements?

18:03.165 --> 18:06.667
Perhaps, but you see,
the only thing I can really...

18:06.835 --> 18:08.503
speculate on, Nurse Ratched...

18:08.670 --> 18:15.009
is the very existence of my life,
with or without my wife...

18:15.177 --> 18:19.764
in terms of the human relationships,
the juxtaposition...

18:19.932 --> 18:22.850
of one person to another,
the form, the content.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.562
Harding, why don't you knock off the bullshit 
and get to the point?

18:26.730 --> 18:28.314
This is the point.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.067
This is the point, Taber.
It's not bullshit.

18:31.235 --> 18:34.570
I'm not just talking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.614
I can't seem to get that through to you.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.867
I'm not just talking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.745
I'm talking about form.
I'm talking about content.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.664
I'm talking about interrelationships.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.542
I'm talking about God, the devil,
hell, heaven.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.545
- Do you understand? Finally?
- Ha!

18:50.712 --> 18:53.005
Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb
I can't believe it.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.341
Oh. Oh.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.885
It makes me feel very peculiar,
very peculiar...

18:58.053 --> 18:59.220
- when you throw in that.
- Peculiar?

18:59.388 --> 19:02.056
- Why?
- What does that mean, peculiar, Harding?

19:02.224 --> 19:05.017
- Peculiar? Peculiar?
- Peculiar?

19:05.352 --> 19:07.937
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I'm going to tell you guys something.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.939
You just don't wanna learn anything.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.024
You just don't want to listen to anybody.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.734
He's got intelligence.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.821
You've never heard the word peculiar?
Say, what are you trying to say?

19:18.407 --> 19:20.241
You trying to say I'm queer?
Is that it?

19:20.409 --> 19:23.202
Little Mary Ann?
Little Marjorie Jane? Huh?

19:23.370 --> 19:25.496
That it?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

19:25.664 --> 19:27.748
Is that your idea of communicating something?

19:27.916 --> 19:30.168
- Well, is it?
- Oh.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.503
They're all crowding in on you, Mr. Harding.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.881
- They're all ganging up on you.
- Is that news?

19:35.465 --> 19:39.260
No, they-- They sometimes wanna
gang up on me too, but I--

19:39.428 --> 19:41.429
- Cheswick, do me a favor.
- What? Huh?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.139
- Take it easy.
- Take it--?

19:43.307 --> 19:45.558
- And stay off my side.
- But I only wanna--

19:45.726 --> 19:47.268
I only wanna help you.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.270
- I understand.
- Don't you want me to--?

19:49.688 --> 19:51.772
- Please.
- But I only wanna--

19:52.107 --> 19:54.108
- Please.
- But I only wanna help you.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.610
Please!

19:57.988 --> 19:59.780
You see...

19:59.948 --> 20:02.533
the other day you made some allusions, 
both of you.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.952
- Illusions?
- A sexual-- Yes, allusions.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.122
Allusions. Not illusions. Allusions...

20:08.290 --> 20:10.958
to sexual problems
I might be having with my wife.

20:11.126 --> 20:14.378
All right, say it's true.
Say I know it to be true, but you don't.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.964
If that's your idea of trying
to tell me something--

20:17.132 --> 20:20.384
Harding, I think you're some
kind of morbid asshole or something.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.636
- Peculiar.
- Asshole again.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.095
It makes you feel peculiar.

20:23.263 --> 20:26.349
You been talking about your wife 
ever since I can remember. She's on your mind.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.976
- Blah, blah, blah.
- I'm not talking about my wife.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.270
When are you gonna get that
through your head?

20:31.438 --> 20:33.814
When are you gonna wise up
and turn her loose?

20:33.982 --> 20:36.108
- Please.
- No, just peculiar.

20:36.276 --> 20:39.820
- I'm tired.
- I don't wanna hear it.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.156
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I'm tired.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.116
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I'm tired. 

20:44.284 --> 20:45.868
- It's a lot of baloney.
- I don't wanna hear it.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.454
It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.916
- I don't wanna hear it.
- We know you're tired. We're tired.

20:52.084 --> 20:56.087
- I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney.
- You're not tired, Bancini.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.966
Take your hands off me.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.370
<i>Recreation time, gentlemen.</i>

21:29.538 --> 21:30.746
<i>The bus is waiting.</i>

21:30.914 --> 21:36.043
<i>All nonrestricted patients
please report to the bus.</i>

21:58.275 --> 22:00.901
Ever play this game, Chief?

22:04.906 --> 22:07.158
Come on, I'll show you.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.618
Old Indian game.

22:09.786 --> 22:14.665
It's called, uh,
Put the Ball in the Hole.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.169
Now, that ought to be--
Just hold it right there.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.378
All right.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.756
Now, that's your spot. 
Don't move.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.216
Never move. That's your spot,
you understand?

22:24.384 --> 22:26.427
Right there. You don't move. Now...

22:26.887 --> 22:28.429
take the ball.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.557
Here, take the ball.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.101
That's it. Hold on to it.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.854
Not too hard, Chief.
You'll crush all the air out of it.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.523
We're gonna put her in the basket.
You understand?

22:39.691 --> 22:43.402
All right.
Now, uh, raise up your arms.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.113
Raise the ball up in the air, Chief.
Raise it up.

22:46.281 --> 22:50.868
McMurphy, what you talking to him for?
He can't hear a fucking thing.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.789
I ain't talking to him. I'm talking to myself.
It helps me think.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.957
Yeah, well, it don't help him none.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.294
Well, it don't hurt him either, does it?

23:00.462 --> 23:02.797
Don't hurt you, does it, Chief?

23:02.964 --> 23:04.799
See? Don't hurt him.

23:07.594 --> 23:10.262
All right, now, Chief, uh...

23:10.430 --> 23:14.308
Let's raise our hands up in the air.
Just raise them up.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.561
Up, you understand?
Raise the hands up, here.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.605
Up. Raise your hands up.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.900
Up. That's it. That's it.
Up, all the way up.

23:23.068 --> 23:27.279
All the way up.
That's a baby, all right. Huh?

23:27.447 --> 23:29.740
Okay, now, uh...

23:29.908 --> 23:33.202
Now, jump up in the air,
and put it in the basket, Chief.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.996
Jump up and dunk it in.

23:36.498 --> 23:40.292
Jump up in the air and stuff
that son of a bitch in there, Chief.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.879
Take a rest, Chief.

23:44.047 --> 23:48.217
Just stay right there. Take a rest.
I'll be right back.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.348
Bancini, come here a minute.

23:54.516 --> 23:57.017
You're looking all right.
Get right over here for a second.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.270
Now, just stand right there.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.647
Just get down a little bit.
All right. Stand up.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.149
Stand up. Go ahead.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.693
Whoo. That's a baby.
All right, you got her.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.611
All right. Now, over there.

24:09.197 --> 24:12.366
Hit me, Chief. I got the moves.
I got them, Chief.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.326
Hold it right there. 
Give me the ball.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.704
Give me the ball. That's it.
Thank you, Chief.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.539
Now, hold it right there.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.710
Now, you take the ball, you jump up
and put it in the basket.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.796
See what I mean? Put it--
Bancini, hold still.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.715
All right, Chief, here. 
Take the ball.

24:27.883 --> 24:32.052
Now, jump up and put her
in the basket, Chief. Huh?

24:32.220 --> 24:35.181
Jump up and put her in the basket!
Not you, Bancini.

24:35.348 --> 24:37.183
Raise up-- Bancini, where you going?

24:37.350 --> 24:38.976
- I'm tired. I'm tired.
- Where--? No.

24:39.144 --> 24:43.147
Fast break. Defense. 
Get back. Back.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.108
Come on, Bancini,
where the fuck you going at?

24:46.276 --> 24:48.402
- General, get this man around here.
- Aah! Aah!

24:48.570 --> 24:52.156
- That's it, back. Over to Chief.
- Oh, I'm tired.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.952
Fast break. Fast break.
Hit me, Chief. Hit me, baby.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.622
Put it in the basket, Chief!

24:59.789 --> 25:02.082
Put it in the basket!

25:16.223 --> 25:18.682
Thirty-eight...

25:19.768 --> 25:21.644
All right.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.563
Make the bets.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.316
- What's this?
- Make the bets.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.944
It's a dime, Martini.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.279
I bet a nickel.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.199
A dime's the limit, Martini.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.453
I bet a dime.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.961
This is not a dime, Martini.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.631
This is a dime.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.466
If you break it in half...

25:52.634 --> 25:55.970
you don't get two nickels,
you get shit.

25:56.137 --> 25:59.306
Try and smoke it. 
You understand?

25:59.641 --> 26:01.308
- Yes.
- You don't understand.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.685
All right, here they come.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.688
Queen to the Chesser,
big bull to Tabelations...

26:05.855 --> 26:09.108
10 to Billy to match his whang,
and the dealer gets a three.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.485
Hit me. Hit me.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.320
- Hit me. I bet a dime.
- I can't hit you...

26:13.488 --> 26:15.447
because it ain't your turn yet.
You understand?

26:15.615 --> 26:18.492
You see these other people?
These are the real ones.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.537
These are real people here.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.999
What'll you do, Ches? 
Hit or sit?

26:25.166 --> 26:26.584
Um...

26:31.673 --> 26:33.007
Hit me.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.175
That's 23 up, Cheswick.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.428
All right, Taber, you're busted.
Give me this.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.972
- Twenty-three--
- Uh? Hit?

26:40.140 --> 26:41.640
- Hit me.
- Shut up!

26:41.808 --> 26:42.850
Taber.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.852
- Give me a dime.
- I'm next, Taber.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.479
You're not next. Huh?

26:47.647 --> 26:49.273
- Hit me.
- Ace.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.109
- Hit me.
- That's four or 14.

26:53.653 --> 26:55.696
Don't want any more. Billy?

26:55.864 --> 26:57.990
- Hit me. Hit me.
- All right, five.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.367
- Hit me. Hit me.
- Huh?

27:00.535 --> 27:04.038
You didn't make a bet, Martini.
I can't hit you. Jesus Christ.

27:04.205 --> 27:05.456
- Huh?
- I bet a dime.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.874
All right, here. Go ahead.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.959
- That's 20 showing.
- No.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.919
- Take your money.
- No.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.129
It's not.

27:12.297 --> 27:16.675
It's 10, 11, 12, 13.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.720
This is a fucking queen here,
you understand?

27:19.888 --> 27:24.016
- You don't count the this... and the this.
- Hit me.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.893
You got 20 showing.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.020
Hit me again. I want another card.

27:28.188 --> 27:32.149
- Scanlon, who's pitching the opener?
- Mac? Mac? Mac, here.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.901
<i>Medication time.</i>

27:34.069 --> 27:38.072
- This isn't a queen.
- <i>Medication time, gentlemen. Medication.</i>

27:38.239 --> 27:41.116
- Mac, hit me.
- Who's the--?

27:41.284 --> 27:43.160
- Who's pitching the opener?
- Hit me.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.662
Jesus Christ Almighty.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.164
Do you nuts wanna play cards
or you wanna jerk off?

27:47.332 --> 27:48.415
Play the game.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.834
I can't even hear myself think already.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.053
Aah! Stay back.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.554
Excuse me, ma'am. 
I just wanted to--

28:02.722 --> 28:04.181
- Stay back.
- Mr. McMurphy.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.475
Patients aren't allowed
in the nurses' station.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.186
Well, I just, ahem, 
wanted to, uh, turn--

28:09.354 --> 28:13.399
When you're outside, we'll discuss
whatever problem you have, okay?

28:13.566 --> 28:18.112
Patients are not allowed
in the nurses' station. All right?

28:18.279 --> 28:20.155
Yes, ma'am.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.365
Billy.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.619
Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on?
Thank you. Excuse me, miss.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.914
Do you think it might be possible
to turn that music down...

28:29.082 --> 28:32.584
so maybe a couple of the boys
could talk?

28:33.128 --> 28:36.171
That music is for everyone,
Mr. McMurphy.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.216
I know, but do you think
we might ease it down a little bit...

28:39.384 --> 28:43.303
so maybe the boys
didn't have to shout? Huh?

28:43.471 --> 28:45.097
What you probably don't realize...

28:45.265 --> 28:47.975
is that we have a lot of old men
on this ward...

28:48.143 --> 28:51.145
who couldn't hear the music
if we turned it lower.

28:51.312 --> 28:54.481
That music is all they have.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.067
Your hand is staining my window.

28:58.653 --> 29:02.990
- Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am. Really sorry.
- All right.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.202
- Mr. McMurphy, your medication.
- Huh?

29:07.787 --> 29:10.831
- What's in the horse pill?
- It's just medicine. It's good for you.

29:10.999 --> 29:15.085
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking something 
if I don't know what it is.

29:15.503 --> 29:19.923
- Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.
- I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.

29:20.091 --> 29:25.345
It's just that I don't want anyone
to try and slip me saltpeter.

29:25.513 --> 29:26.513
You know what I mean?

29:27.849 --> 29:29.558
It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.

29:29.726 --> 29:33.687
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want
to take his medication orally...

29:33.855 --> 29:37.775
I'm sure we can arrange
that he can have it some other way.

29:39.277 --> 29:43.113
But I don't think you'd like it,
Mr. McMurphy.

29:44.574 --> 29:48.035
You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?
Give it to me.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.704
- Good.
- Mm.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.416
Mm.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.170
Very good.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.882
Mm, yummy.

30:05.553 --> 30:08.305
- Mr. Harding?
- Mm-hm. Oh.

30:23.530 --> 30:24.947
Tell me, lover boy...

30:25.114 --> 30:28.158
why didn't you tell her
to go fuck herself?

30:34.249 --> 30:35.749
Jesus Christ.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.920
Okay. Funny, huh? 
That's funny, huh?

30:40.088 --> 30:42.422
You know, that wasn't very smart.
She could have seen that.

30:42.590 --> 30:43.924
- Oh.
- Yeah.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.843
- Ooh.
- Oh.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.302
Ooh.

30:47.470 --> 30:51.014
God Almighty,
she's got you guys coming or going.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.767
What do you think she is?
Some kind of a champ or something?

30:53.935 --> 30:55.769
No, I thought you were the champ.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.981
Wanna bet?

30:59.148 --> 31:01.149
Bet on what?

31:01.317 --> 31:02.359
One week.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.987
I bet in one week I can put a bug
so far up her ass...

31:05.154 --> 31:07.197
she don't know whether to shit
or wind her watch.

31:07.365 --> 31:10.284
What do you say to that? Wanna bet?
No, you wanna bet?

31:10.451 --> 31:12.578
One week. That's all I need.
Who wants to bet?

31:12.745 --> 31:16.039
You wanna bet? Bet a buck.
One buck. Huh?

31:16.207 --> 31:17.916
I'll bet.

31:18.668 --> 31:22.796
Tabes in, 1 buck. Solid.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.883
Last time we were discussing...

31:26.050 --> 31:28.218
Mr. Harding and the problem
with his wife...

31:28.386 --> 31:31.763
and I think we were making
a lot of progress.

31:32.181 --> 31:35.183
So who would like to begin today?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.440
Mr. McMurphy?

31:41.608 --> 31:45.944
Yeah, I've been thinking about
what you said about, uh...

31:47.280 --> 31:49.656
you know, getting things
off your chest.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.659
And, uh... Uh, ahem.

31:52.827 --> 31:56.121
Well, there's a couple of things
that I'd like to get off my chest.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.957
Well, that's very good,
Mr. McMurphy. Go ahead.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.834
Okay.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.421
Today, as you may or may not know--
It doesn't matter.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.465
--is the opening of the World Series.

32:07.884 --> 32:12.346
What I'd like to suggest is that
we change the work detail tonight...

32:12.513 --> 32:15.349
so that we can watch the ball game.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.646
Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking...

32:21.189 --> 32:25.943
is that we change
a very carefully worked-out schedule.

32:27.362 --> 32:31.281
A little change never hurt, huh?
A little variety?

32:32.033 --> 32:35.035
Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.

32:35.203 --> 32:40.374
Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.

32:40.541 --> 32:43.502
Change it now,
and they might find it very disturbing.

32:43.670 --> 32:47.214
Ah, fuck the schedule. They can go back
to the schedule after the Series.

32:47.382 --> 32:51.718
I'm talking about the World Series,
Nurse Ratched. Huh?

32:51.886 --> 32:55.389
Well, anyway, this is no way
to proceed about this.

32:55.556 --> 32:59.101
How would it be if we had a vote...

32:59.268 --> 33:00.894
and let majority rule?

33:01.396 --> 33:03.563
Great. Let's vote on her.

33:05.233 --> 33:09.236
So all those in favor, raise your hands.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.074
Okay, guys, come on.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.744
Put your hands up.

33:19.872 --> 33:24.084
What's the matter with you?
Don't you wanna watch the World Series?

33:24.711 --> 33:26.878
Come on, get your hands up.
It'll do you good...

33:27.046 --> 33:30.716
to get some exercise
putting your arms up in the air.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.260
That's it. Come on, let's...

33:42.687 --> 33:45.731
What is this crap?
I mean, I watch the Series.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.691
I haven't missed the Series in years.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.862
Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler,
they run it there or they have a riot.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.824
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, be good Americans.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.706
Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes...

34:02.874 --> 34:05.959
and that's not enough
to change ward policy.

34:06.127 --> 34:07.419
I'm sorry.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.842
My turn. Okay, hot dice.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.887
I wanna get to go.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.638
Because I need cash.

34:18.806 --> 34:22.684
I wanna get to Mediterranean Avenue.
Big 10. Perfect.

34:22.893 --> 34:27.773
Two fives. Two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

34:27.940 --> 34:30.067
- What are you doing?
- Hotel.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.652
- You do not have a hotel there.
- Hotel.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.196
For the third time...

34:34.362 --> 34:36.656
- you do not have a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

34:36.824 --> 34:40.284
- It costs $1000 and four green houses...
- Hotel.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.329
- to put a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

34:42.496 --> 34:43.538
Play the game.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.373
- Knock off the bullshit.
- Huh?

34:45.541 --> 34:48.126
- Play the game, Harding.
- What are you talking about?

34:48.293 --> 34:50.420
- Play the game.
- I ain't doing anything to you.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.838
- What bullshit?
- Your bullshit.

34:52.005 --> 34:53.590
- Your bullshit?
- Play the game.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.175
- Hands off me.
- Play the game.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.469
- Enough bullshit. You hear me?
- Play the game.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.680
- What the fuck are you picking on me for?
- Play the game, Harding.

35:00.848 --> 35:03.141
- Look, I'm trying to ignore you.
- Just play the game.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.018
Keep your hands off me.

35:05.186 --> 35:08.230
- Keep your hands off me! You hear me?
- Play the game.

35:08.397 --> 35:11.525
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I can be pushed just so far, see.

35:11.692 --> 35:12.734
Play the game.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.654
You touch me once more.
Just touch me once more.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.031
Just once more, huh?
Just once more.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.534
- Just touch me once more.
- Play the game, Harding.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.577
Just touch me once more.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.704
Holy Jesus.

35:42.306 --> 35:46.059
Is that what your schedule
does for you, Hard-on? Huh?

35:46.853 --> 35:48.770
Damn lunatic.

35:48.938 --> 35:53.441
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh?

35:53.609 --> 35:56.820
Because I'm going downtown
and watch the World Series anyway.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.405
Anybody wanna come with me?

35:58.573 --> 36:03.410
- I do, Mac. I wanna go with you.
- Ches, all right. Anybody else?

36:03.578 --> 36:06.496
- Where?
- Any bar downtown.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.498
Mac-- Mac, you can't--

36:08.666 --> 36:11.877
Can't get-- Can't get out of here.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.005
Anybody wanna bet?

36:15.173 --> 36:18.049
Hmm, chickenshits?

36:18.467 --> 36:21.011
Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched
his big thing...

36:21.179 --> 36:22.804
and she'll open the door for him.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.185
Yeah, maybe I will...

36:28.394 --> 36:31.980
and then maybe I'll just use your thick skull 
and knock a hole in the wall.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.732
Sefelt, see?

36:36.736 --> 36:39.404
Why, my head would squash
like an eggplant.

36:41.449 --> 36:44.034
Fuck Sefelt's head,
I don't need Sefelt's head.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.453
I'm gonna take this,
put it through the window...

36:46.621 --> 36:49.372
and me and my buddy Cheswick
are gonna go out...

36:49.540 --> 36:52.542
downtown, sit down in a bar,
wet our whistles...

36:52.710 --> 36:54.211
and watch the ball game.

36:54.378 --> 36:58.632
And that's the bet. 
Now, does anybody want any of it? Huh?

36:59.759 --> 37:01.259
You're gonna lift that thing?

37:02.678 --> 37:04.804
Yeah. That's right.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.724
I'll bet a buck.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.894
Taber, $1.

37:11.646 --> 37:12.979
I bet a dime.

37:13.147 --> 37:18.151
Mac, you can't--
Can't li-- Lift that thing.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.614
Anybody else want any of it? 
Hard-on?

37:22.782 --> 37:24.658
Hmm?

37:25.493 --> 37:28.453
I'll bet $25.

37:28.621 --> 37:31.331
Twenty-five dollars, Hard-on.

37:31.499 --> 37:37.003
Mac! Mac, no--
Nobody could ever lift that thing.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.464
Get out of my way, son.
You're using my oxygen.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.174
You know what I mean?

37:42.677 --> 37:46.680
All right.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.360
Giving up?

38:03.864 --> 38:06.283
No. Just warming up.

38:06.450 --> 38:11.830
Warming up. Warming up.
This will be the one.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.793
All right, baby. Come on.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.551
Fucking thing.

39:04.216 --> 39:06.676
But I tried, didn't I? 
Goddamn it.

39:06.844 --> 39:09.346
At least I did that.

39:15.978 --> 39:19.272
<i>And on the mound,
the left-hander Al Downing.</i>

39:19.440 --> 39:22.692
<i>The two pitchers still warming up
right down below us.</i>

39:22.860 --> 39:25.653
<i>The second game
of the 1963 World Series...</i>

39:25.821 --> 39:30.617
<i>is being brought to you
from Yankee Stadium.</i>

39:33.120 --> 39:36.623
Did you tell the girl
how you felt about her?

39:43.881 --> 39:46.549
Well-- Well, I went--

39:46.717 --> 39:49.552
I went over to her house...

39:49.720 --> 39:53.181
one Sunday afternoon...

39:53.349 --> 39:58.144
and I brought--
Brought her some flowers.

40:02.233 --> 40:05.402
And I said-- I said:

40:06.946 --> 40:10.490
"Celia, will you ma--?"

40:14.995 --> 40:17.497
"Ma--? Marry me?"

40:35.349 --> 40:37.350
Billy?

40:39.019 --> 40:40.854
Why did you want to marry her?

40:43.983 --> 40:48.194
Well, I was in lo--
In love with her.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.115
Your mother told me
that you never told her about it.

41:01.333 --> 41:06.212
Billy, why didn't you tell her about it?

41:17.725 --> 41:23.605
Billy, wasn't that the first time
you tried to commit suicide?

41:31.197 --> 41:33.656
Oh, my God.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.742
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

41:36.410 --> 41:38.369
Miss Ratched...

41:38.537 --> 41:40.497
I'd like to ask you a question, please.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.832
Go ahead.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.085
Okay, uh...

41:46.253 --> 41:48.463
You know, if, uh...

41:48.631 --> 41:51.758
Billy doesn't feel like, 
uh, talking...

41:52.176 --> 41:55.845
I mean, uh,
why are you pressing him?

41:56.013 --> 41:58.723
Why can't we go on
to some new business?

41:58.891 --> 41:59.933
Huh?

42:00.434 --> 42:03.269
The business of this meeting,
Mr. Cheswick...

42:03.437 --> 42:05.313
is therapy.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.482
Oh.

42:08.651 --> 42:11.778
Well, you know,
I don't understand this, Miss Ratched...

42:11.946 --> 42:14.197
because, uh, I don't, uh...

42:14.365 --> 42:15.782
Mr. McMurphy...

42:15.950 --> 42:20.620
he said something yesterday
about a World Series.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.747
A baseball game?

42:23.332 --> 42:26.042
You know, and I've never been
to a baseball game...

42:26.210 --> 42:29.254
and, well,
I think I'd like to see one...

42:29.421 --> 42:34.133
and that would be good therapy, too,
wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?

42:34.969 --> 42:37.470
I thought we'd decided that issue.

42:39.014 --> 42:43.101
Well, I don't think so,
because, I mean...

42:43.269 --> 42:45.979
we discussed that yesterday...

42:46.146 --> 42:49.983
and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?

42:50.150 --> 42:54.320
That's right, Ches, and we want
a new vote on it, don't we?

42:57.449 --> 43:00.868
Would one more vote satisfy you,
Mr. McMurphy?

43:01.036 --> 43:02.537
Yeah.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.747
It'll satisfy me.

43:06.166 --> 43:08.209
There's a vote before the group.

43:08.377 --> 43:13.339
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule, 
please raise your hand.

43:16.343 --> 43:19.721
Okay, I wanna see the hands.
Come on.

43:19.888 --> 43:23.516
Which one of you nuts
has got any guts?

43:29.857 --> 43:34.861
- All right. That's it.
- I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.

43:35.029 --> 43:38.698
Ha-ha-ha. She only counts nine.
Only nine. It's a landslide.

43:40.326 --> 43:44.287
There are 18 patients on this ward, 
Mr. McMurphy...

43:44.455 --> 43:47.665
and you have to have a majority
to change ward policy.

43:48.542 --> 43:52.211
So you gentlemen
can put your hands down now.

43:56.717 --> 44:00.261
Are you trying to tell me
that you're gonna count these?

44:00.429 --> 44:03.973
These poor son of a bitches?
They don't know what we're talking about.

44:04.683 --> 44:07.727
Well, I have to disagree with you,
Mr. McMurphy.

44:07.895 --> 44:11.731
These men are members of the ward,
just as you are.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.569
All right. 
All I need is one vote, right?

44:16.904 --> 44:18.446
Right?

44:18.614 --> 44:19.697
All right.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.492
Okay.

44:23.410 --> 44:26.204
Wanna watch the World Series?
Come on in, pal.

44:26.372 --> 44:29.332
This could be a big moment for you.
Wanna watch a baseball game?

44:29.500 --> 44:30.667
You wanna watch baseball?

44:30.834 --> 44:33.044
Just raise that hand up.
Just raise the hand up.

44:33.212 --> 44:35.380
- What do you say?
- I gave it all to her.

44:35.547 --> 44:36.923
Sorry.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.050
Bancini, old horse.

44:39.218 --> 44:42.011
What do you say? You wanna watch
the ball game on TV? Huh?

44:42.179 --> 44:44.472
Wanna watch the ball game?
Baseball? World Series?

44:44.640 --> 44:45.973
- What do you say, pal?
- I'm tired.

44:46.141 --> 44:47.183
You're tired?

44:47.351 --> 44:49.977
Just raise your hand up, Bancini.
Watch the ball game, huh?

44:50.145 --> 44:53.564
- I'm tired. Awfully tired.
- Okay. All right.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.608
What about you, pal?

44:55.776 --> 44:59.362
All we need's one vote. Just one vote.
Just your one vote. That's all we need.

44:59.530 --> 45:04.575
Just raise your hand up, and your buddies
can watch the baseball game on...

45:10.457 --> 45:14.585
General, you remember, don't you?
October, the banner, the stars.

45:17.339 --> 45:19.173
The World Series.
Raise your hand up, Gen--

45:21.593 --> 45:23.803
Just raise your hand up.

45:25.389 --> 45:28.474
What about you pal, huh?
Wanna watch the ball game?

45:28.642 --> 45:31.769
Wanna watch the ball game, huh?
Just one vote. Just raise your...

45:32.771 --> 45:34.480
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.

45:34.648 --> 45:37.400
For chrissake, isn't there
one of you fucking maniacs...

45:37.568 --> 45:39.819
- that knows what I'm talking about?
- Mr. McMurphy?

45:39.987 --> 45:41.112
Huh?

45:41.280 --> 45:42.739
The meeting is adjourned.

45:42.906 --> 45:44.657
Just wait a minute.
Just one minute?

45:45.159 --> 45:47.744
You can bring the subject up
again tomorrow.

45:47.911 --> 45:49.412
All right, Chief...

45:50.497 --> 45:54.125
you're our last chance. What do you say?
Huh? Just raise your hand up.

45:54.293 --> 45:57.962
That's all we need from you today, Chief.
Just raise your hand up one time.

45:58.130 --> 46:02.008
Show her that you can do it.
Just show her that you can still do it.

46:02.176 --> 46:04.677
Just raise your hand up.
All the guys have got them up.

46:04.845 --> 46:08.347
Just raise your hand up, Chief.
Will you? Huh?

46:11.769 --> 46:15.521
Come on, there's gotta be one guy in here
that's not a total fucking nut.

46:15.689 --> 46:17.398
Mac?

46:18.400 --> 46:19.901
Chief. The Chief.

46:21.278 --> 46:24.197
Chief! Nurse Ratched!
Nurse Ratched, look.

46:24.364 --> 46:26.532
Look. The Chief put his hand up.

46:26.700 --> 46:28.618
The Chief put his hand up.
Look, he voted.

46:28.786 --> 46:32.205
Would you please turn--? Would you please
turn the television set on?

46:32.372 --> 46:34.665
The Chief has got his hand up,
right there.

46:36.877 --> 46:40.630
The Chief voted. Now, will you please
turn the television set on?

46:40.798 --> 46:41.881
Mr. McMurphy...

46:42.049 --> 46:44.550
the meeting was adjourned,
and the vote was closed.

46:44.718 --> 46:48.262
But the vote was 10-to-8.
The Chief, he's got his hand up. Look.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.597
No, Mr. McMurphy.

46:49.765 --> 46:53.768
When the meeting was adjourned,
the vote was 9-to-9.

46:54.353 --> 46:58.231
Ah, come on, you're not gonna say that now. 
You're not gonna say that now.

46:58.398 --> 47:02.151
You're gonna pull that shit now, when--
The Chief just voted. It was 10-to-9.

47:02.319 --> 47:06.864
I want that television set turned on!
Right now!

47:11.453 --> 47:12.995
Mr. Cheswick.

47:13.747 --> 47:15.998
Come on. Come on.

47:16.166 --> 47:19.210
- I wanna watch television.
- No, you have a work assignment.

47:39.731 --> 47:41.566
- Koufax.
- Where's my sponge?

47:41.733 --> 47:46.445
Koufax kicks. He delivers.
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.

47:46.613 --> 47:50.283
Richardson's rounding first, going for second. 
The ball's in to deep right center.

47:50.450 --> 47:52.702
Davidson over in the corner.
Here comes the throw.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.621
Richardson around the dirt.
Slides, he's in there! A double!

47:55.789 --> 47:58.416
He's in there, Martini!
Richardson, he's on second base.

47:58.584 --> 48:01.168
Koufax is in big fucking trouble.
Big trouble, baby.

48:01.336 --> 48:03.462
All right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter.

48:03.630 --> 48:05.506
Tresh looks in. Koufax...

48:05.674 --> 48:08.676
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro.
He kicks once, he pumps.

48:08.844 --> 48:12.555
It's a strike. Koufax's curve ball
is snapping off like a fucking firecracker.

48:12.723 --> 48:14.473
Here he comes with the next pitch.

48:14.641 --> 48:17.810
Tresh swings.
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!

48:19.396 --> 48:22.315
- It's going! It's gone!
- <i>Mr. Washington...</i>

48:22.482 --> 48:25.693
<i>and Mr. Warren, please see 
that the men are doing their work.</i>

48:27.279 --> 48:29.739
Somebody get me a fucking wiener
before I die.

48:31.408 --> 48:35.703
Koufax looks down. Looking at the great
Mickey Mantle now. Here comes the pitch.

48:35.871 --> 48:39.206
Mantle swings.
It's a fucking home run!

48:39.374 --> 48:42.043
<i>Gentlemen, stop this.</i>

48:42.210 --> 48:45.254
<i>Stop this immediately.</i>

48:54.264 --> 48:56.599
Do you like it here?

49:00.187 --> 49:02.772
Well, that fucking nurse, man.

49:03.690 --> 49:05.483
What do you mean, sir?

49:05.859 --> 49:08.069
She, uh...

49:14.868 --> 49:17.536
She ain't honest.

49:19.122 --> 49:20.164
Oh, now, look.

49:20.332 --> 49:24.585
Miss Ratched's one of the finest nurses
we've got in this institution.

49:27.381 --> 49:30.466
Well, I don't wanna break up
the meeting or nothing...

49:30.634 --> 49:33.511
but she's something of a cunt,
ain't she, doc?

49:34.137 --> 49:36.305
How do you mean that?

49:37.307 --> 49:40.893
She likes a rigged game.
You know what I mean?

49:45.857 --> 49:49.735
Well, you know, I've, uh,
been observing you here now...

49:49.903 --> 49:51.529
for the last four weeks...

49:51.697 --> 49:56.325
and I don't see any evidence
of mental illness at all.

49:56.493 --> 50:00.121
I think that you've been trying
to put us on all this time.

50:01.123 --> 50:04.083
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.

50:06.211 --> 50:09.588
You know what I mean? Is that it?
Is that crazy enough for you?

50:09.756 --> 50:13.759
Want me to take a shit on the floor?
Hmm. Christ.

50:14.302 --> 50:17.930
Have you ever heard the old saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss"?

50:19.850 --> 50:21.767
Yeah.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.270
Does that mean something to you?

50:24.604 --> 50:25.855
Uh...

50:29.151 --> 50:33.779
It's the same as 
"Don't wash your dirty underwear in public."

50:34.114 --> 50:36.574
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.703
I'm smarter than him, ain't l?

50:43.290 --> 50:46.250
Well, that sort of 
has always meant is, uh...

50:46.835 --> 50:50.463
it's hard for something to grow
on something that's moving.

50:50.922 --> 50:54.425
How did you feel about
what happened yesterday?

50:59.473 --> 51:02.892
Well, you wanna kill.
You know what I mean?

51:11.443 --> 51:13.486
Do you gentlemen 
have any more questions?

51:13.653 --> 51:15.946
No, not at the moment.

51:16.114 --> 51:18.949
I don't have any more,
but, uh, perhaps you do.

51:19.117 --> 51:20.659
Do you have a question, McMurphy?

51:21.995 --> 51:24.830
Where do you suppose she lives?

51:55.195 --> 51:58.030
Chief, come on with me.

51:58.198 --> 52:00.032
Come on.

52:00.200 --> 52:03.035
We'll show these guys who's nuts.

52:03.203 --> 52:04.203
Huh?

52:04.371 --> 52:07.164
All right, wait. 
Stand right here.

52:08.875 --> 52:12.211
All right. Grab the fence.

52:12.379 --> 52:14.338
Grab the fence here.

52:14.506 --> 52:17.883
Right here, Chief. Strong.
Strong, like this, here.

52:21.930 --> 52:26.976
That's it. All right. 
Okay. Up.

52:27.144 --> 52:30.396
That's it. 
All right, you got it?

52:34.484 --> 52:37.486
You do. This one.
Here. All right, push.

53:20.906 --> 53:22.990
Come on, Bob.

53:23.158 --> 53:25.326
Where you going?

53:25.952 --> 53:30.080
Don't breathe on me, Club.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

53:32.834 --> 53:35.878
Come on, you guys.
Get the lead out, huh?

53:44.346 --> 53:46.472
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

53:46.640 --> 53:48.641
Hey, wait a minute. Aah!

53:48.808 --> 53:49.975
Hold it.

53:50.435 --> 53:53.979
- See how easy it is?
- Oh! Whoa!

54:30.267 --> 54:31.767
Boys...

54:32.852 --> 54:38.607
this here is Candy.
Candy, this is the boys.

54:39.025 --> 54:40.859
Hi.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.612
- Hi.
- Oh!

54:52.122 --> 54:53.872
You all crazies?

55:19.941 --> 55:21.275
Let's go. Down here.

55:21.443 --> 55:24.653
- Isn't this wonderful?
- Right down here.

55:25.071 --> 55:26.905
No problem.

55:27.490 --> 55:28.490
Huh?

55:28.658 --> 55:31.076
Right here. Come on.

55:31.244 --> 55:34.705
Come on, we don't wanna be late
for our first day out.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.588
Hello.

55:46.885 --> 55:49.928
Come on, will youse?
What are you standing around for here?

55:50.096 --> 55:52.431
Get onboard. 
Give them these, Candy.

55:55.435 --> 55:58.520
Hey, wait a minute.
What the heck is going on here?

55:59.230 --> 56:02.941
- What are you doing on this boat?
- We're going fishing.

56:03.109 --> 56:05.277
No, you're not going fishing.

56:05.445 --> 56:08.822
Not on this boat.
You're not going fishing on this boat.

56:08.990 --> 56:12.284
Oh, yeah, on this boat.
Uh, ask Captain Block.

56:12.452 --> 56:15.079
- Captain Block?
- Captain Block. Yes, that's right.

56:15.246 --> 56:16.997
Who are you?

56:18.041 --> 56:22.461
Uh, we're from the, uh,
state mental institution.

56:22.629 --> 56:23.962
Uh...

56:24.130 --> 56:28.967
This is Dr. Cheswick, Dr. Taber,
Dr. Fredrickson...

56:29.135 --> 56:32.596
Dr. Scanlon.
The famous Dr. Scanlon.

56:32.764 --> 56:35.474
Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit...

56:35.642 --> 56:40.270
Dr. Martini, and, uh, Dr. Sefelt.

56:41.815 --> 56:46.485
- How about you? Who are you?
- Oh. I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy.

56:51.908 --> 56:54.243
Wait, wait, wait one second.
You don't understand.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.870
We chartered the boat,
we're going to go fishing...

56:57.038 --> 56:59.665
and, uh, that's all there is to it.

57:05.255 --> 57:09.341
You better quit on this. They'll throw you
in the can again, you know.

57:09.759 --> 57:11.760
No, they won't. We're nuts.

57:13.096 --> 57:16.557
They'll just take us back
to the feeb farm, see?

57:17.100 --> 57:20.853
Von Sefelt, get the stern line.

57:21.020 --> 57:24.189
- Tabes, you're at the bow.
- This one?

57:26.693 --> 57:29.194
That one. The one at your feet.

57:36.202 --> 57:39.037
Get back on. Jesus.

57:41.499 --> 57:43.167
Tabes.

58:26.044 --> 58:27.169
Cheswick.

58:29.088 --> 58:30.255
Come here, quick.

58:37.263 --> 58:39.264
Aye, aye, sir. I mean, yes, Mac.

58:39.432 --> 58:42.726
Take it easy, Charlie.
You ever driven one of these things?

58:42.894 --> 58:45.437
- Driven one of--?
- Yeah.

58:45.605 --> 58:49.107
- No, Mac. I-- I--
- Well, it's a lot of fun.

58:49.275 --> 58:50.526
- Lot of fun.
- Come on over here.

58:50.693 --> 58:51.735
Put your hands on the wheel.

58:51.903 --> 58:53.612
- Put your hands on.
- I never did this.

58:53.780 --> 58:56.823
Put your hands on the wheel
so you don't fall down. All right.

58:56.991 --> 58:59.117
Just hold it steady right there, 
like that.

58:59.285 --> 59:00.494
- Steady?
- Steady, yeah.

59:00.662 --> 59:02.120
Now just go straight.

59:02.288 --> 59:04.456
- Straight as an arrow, Charlie.
- Straight, Mac?

59:04.624 --> 59:06.959
- Just straight. That's right.
- But, Mac...

59:07.126 --> 59:11.004
Mac, this thing 
ain't too steady, Mac. Mac!

59:11.172 --> 59:16.134
- Mac. Where are we going, Mac?
- Straight. Just go on.

59:18.054 --> 59:23.016
Oh.

59:25.645 --> 59:28.063
This is the bait.

59:29.649 --> 59:32.568
- Little fishes.
- Dead fishes.

59:32.735 --> 59:34.319
That's right.

59:34.487 --> 59:38.198
Now, what are we gonna do
with these little fishes?

59:39.492 --> 59:43.996
- Catch big fishes.
- That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini.

59:44.163 --> 59:48.000
And hooks.

59:48.167 --> 59:49.960
Hooks.

59:51.129 --> 59:55.841
Now, hold on to your hooks
because here are the fishes.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.010
Tabes.

59:59.929 --> 01:00:03.599
Get a fish here.
There, for you, Martini.

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:07.519
All right, now we each one of us
has got a fish.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.940
What are you laughing at, Martini?
You're not an idiot, huh?

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:15.193
You're not a goddamn loony now, boy,
you're a fisherman. Ha-ha-ha.

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:20.324
- Yes. Yes.
- Huh? Now, take your bottom hook.

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:22.993
- You got it?
- Yes.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:24.870
You take it...

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:30.709
and you push it all the way through. 
Like that.

01:00:31.377 --> 01:00:33.462
Wait a second.
Get it through the eyes. Here.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:35.589
- Right through here.
- In his eye?

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:37.799
Don't worry about it.
He's dead, Martini.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:41.595
Jesus Christ, just put it
through his eyeball here.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:42.929
That's it.

01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:46.224
Crunch it right through.
All right. Now you got it, see?

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:49.561
Now, you just pull that baby through.
You see what I mean?

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:53.190
And you wrap it around.
You pull this so it's a little loop.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:54.566
- That's very good.
- Aah!

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.943
That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson.

01:00:57.111 --> 01:01:00.072
Very good eye work. Good eye work.

01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:03.909
That little devil's gonna not even
feel the sting, is he, boy? Huh?

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:08.121
That son of a gun is gonna bite on you, 
is he? Let me see that face.

01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:13.794
You-- You, um--
Got-- Got-- Got beautiful hair.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.046
Thank you.

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:18.965
You gotta pull it tight like this.

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:20.926
And you-- You, um, got--

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:26.473
Beautiful eyes.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.893
Thank you. Heh-heh.

01:01:31.604 --> 01:01:35.107
Billy, what's the matter?
Fishing don't grab you?

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:42.489
Yeah-- Yeah--
They-- They-- They do.

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.658
Now, come on with me, over here.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:48.537
I'm gonna give each
and every one of youse a rod.

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:56.712
All right. 
Here are your poles.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:13.562
Now, just keep watching the tip here.
If you get a strike, let me know.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:14.771
Understand?

01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:18.233
Come on, Candy.
Just keep fishing, guys.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.819
Don't call me unless you get
something really big...

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.905
you can't handle yourselves.

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.660
Keep on fishing.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:32.456
That's right.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:02.652
Mac?

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.031
Hey! Where is everybody?

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:14.581
Hey. Hey!

01:03:18.377 --> 01:03:22.255
Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you
to steer that boat straight.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:23.632
I tried to.

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.385
Fish!

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.556
Fish! Help, help!

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:36.353
Goddamn it, he's got a fish. Hold it!
Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:39.564
Cheswick, get the fuck back up there!
Get up there and drive!

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:41.399
- Fish!
- I got it, Tabes.

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.735
Get up, Tabes, I'll get it for you.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:48.156
Son of a bitch, he's going over here!
Get up, Tabes!

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:53.745
I got it.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.622
I got it. Give it to me.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:59.584
- Hey, Harding, I'm the skipper of this boat.
- Ah, shut up.

01:03:59.752 --> 01:04:02.504
Well, he said to go straight out
as an arrow.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.923
You're not going straight,
you're kind of...

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:08.510
I'm going straight enough.
Now, Chessy, stop it.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:12.389
- It's my duty.
- Chessy, stop it.

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:15.100
- No!
- Don't you--

01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:18.395
No, you son of a bitch.

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:22.524
All right, Martini.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:26.695
All right, take him over.
Take him over.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.072
That's it. Now play them, boys.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.783
You son of a bitches.

01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:35.871
Keep it straight.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:38.123
Come back this way.

01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:12.782
Home safe and sound. 
Didn't lose a nut.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:14.826
Beach bowling, you know what I mean?

01:05:17.496 --> 01:05:18.622
We caught it, look.

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:20.665
They're gonna be trolling this place...

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.584
for six months
looking for dead bodies.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:23.752
Whoo!

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.171
We caught it. Look.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.886
I think he's dangerous.

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:36.848
He's not crazy, but he's dangerous.

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:41.561
- You don't think he's crazy?
- No, he's not crazy.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:44.773
Dr. Songee?

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:48.109
I don't think he's overly psychotic...

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:50.320
but I still think he's quite sick.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:54.866
- Do you think he's dangerous?
- Absolutely so.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:59.871
Well, John, what do you wanna do 
with him?

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.877
Well, I think we've had our turn.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:10.715
I'd like to send him back to the, 
uh, work farm, frankly.

01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:15.053
Is there anybody
that you have on your staff...

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:19.349
that could relate to him?
Maybe understand him?

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.559
Help him out
with some of these problems?

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:25.480
Well, the funny thing is that the person 
that he's the closest to...

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.857
is the one he dislikes the most. Heh.

01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:29.693
- Well, sure.
- That's you, Mildred.

01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:34.364
Well, gentlemen, in my opinion,
if we send him back to Pendleton...

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:37.909
or we send him up to Disturbed...

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:43.248
it's just one more way of passing on
our problem to somebody else.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.042
You know we don't like to do that.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:50.922
So I'd like to keep him on the ward.

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.967
I think we can help him.

01:06:56.637 --> 01:07:01.099
All right, huh? 
Chief. Chief, come on.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:04.436
Come with me, huh? 
All right.

01:07:04.603 --> 01:07:08.273
Now, Chief, this is the spot.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:13.319
Right there is the spot. Remember?
Raise the hands, in the basket.

01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:15.280
That's it. Raise the hands up.

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:19.451
All right. Let's have a little ball
from you nuts in here. Here we go.

01:07:19.618 --> 01:07:22.579
All right. Let's play some ball, nuts.
Let's make some moves.

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:27.250
Hey, Mac, Mac. Time, time, time.
You got six men on the court.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:31.671
All right. 
Harding, out of the ball game.

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.131
Hey, why me?

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:37.302
- Because I'm the coach. I'll put you in later.
- Oh, no, no. I don't trust you.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:42.140
Ma-- Mac, I'll go.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:46.144
Okay, good boy, Billy.
I'll put you in in a minute, all right?

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.190
All right, let's play ball.
Harding, break over.

01:07:50.357 --> 01:07:53.568
All right, Martini, get it back.
I'm in the open. What are you doing?

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.487
You threw the damn ball
into the fence!

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:58.364
Christ Almighty, 
you threw the ball into the fence!

01:07:58.532 --> 01:08:00.700
There's nobody there.
We're playing ball.

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:05.163
All right, come on, get in the game.
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here.

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.624
- For chrissake.
- Hey, Mac, I'm open. I'm open.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:10.543
All right, Harding, give it back.
Back to me, Harding. Here.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:12.796
I'm open.
Harding, will you give me the ball?

01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:15.006
- Stop dribbling the goddamn ball.
- I got it.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:16.424
Harding, over here.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.511
Oh, for chrissake, I'm standing--

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:21.179
- You were covered.
- I was open.

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:23.890
Just give me the ball.
They're making all over the--

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:25.809
I was open. Give me the ball.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:31.189
- You were covered, Mac.
- I wasn't covered. Somebody get back.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.358
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- All right?

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:34.943
- Ow!
- Yeah, we're going.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.779
Chief. Attababy, put it in.

01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:43.952
Get down there.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.412
- Defense.
- Hey!

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:50.959
Get down there, Chief.
All right, all right.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.711
- Pick up somebody over there!
- Get this side.

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:55.212
Get around, Chief.

01:08:58.884 --> 01:09:01.553
No, no, no. 
Get down there, Chief.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.055
The ball's in play. Ball's in play.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.392
- That's bullshit.
- Ball's in play.

01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:10.478
Oh, fuck that shit.
You got to be crazy.

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:13.356
Man, that doesn't go. 
The ball ain't in play.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:16.359
- Chief.
- Go on, Chief.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:17.652
Put it in.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:23.575
Chief, all right! 
That was great!

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.746
What a ball club.

01:09:57.109 --> 01:09:59.903
McMurphy, get off the side.

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:02.447
- Come on, move it, man.
- Hey, damn it.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:06.451
Go ahead. Come on. Come on.
There's no one looking.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:09.037
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:12.040
Go ahead.

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:16.502
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
You know what I mean?

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:18.963
By the time you get out of here...

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:21.049
you'll be too old to even get it up.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:25.094
Sixty-eight days, buddy.
Sixty-eight days.

01:10:25.262 --> 01:10:28.056
What the fuck you talking about,
68 days?

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.808
That's in jail, sucker.

01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:33.895
You still don't know where you're at,
do you?

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:38.483
- Yeah, where am I at, Washington?
- With us, baby, you're with us.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:43.112
And you're gonna stay with us
until we let you go.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:54.290
Do you want to say something
to the group, Mr. McMurphy?

01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:58.586
Well, ahem, yeah.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:04.050
I'd like to know why none of the guys
never told me that you...

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:05.802
Miss Ratched...

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:10.974
and the doctors could keep me here
till you're good and ready to turn me loose.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:16.980
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Well, fine, Randall. That's a good start.

01:11:17.147 --> 01:11:20.608
Would anyone care
to answer Mr. McMurphy?

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.444
Answer what?

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:25.613
You heard me, Harding.

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:28.533
You let me go on hassling
Nurse Ratched here...

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:32.453
knowing how much I had to lose
and you never told me nothing.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.455
Now, Mac, wait a minute.

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:37.166
Wait a minute, I didn't know
anything about how much--

01:11:37.334 --> 01:11:39.961
- Shit. Fuck.
- Wait a minute. No, listen.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:44.757
Now, look. I'm voluntary here, see?
I'm not committed.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:50.054
I don't have to stay here.
I mean, I can go home any time I want.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:53.057
You can go home any time you want?

01:11:53.225 --> 01:11:55.685
- That's it.
- You're bullshitting me.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.895
He's bullshitting me, right?

01:11:58.063 --> 01:12:01.899
No, Randall,
he's telling you the truth.

01:12:02.067 --> 01:12:06.154
As a matter of fact, there are
very few men here who are committed.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:10.241
There's Mr. Bromden, Mr. Taber...

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:13.953
some of the chronics, and you.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:21.627
- Cheswick?
- Hmm?

01:12:21.795 --> 01:12:24.255
You're voluntary?

01:12:24.965 --> 01:12:26.090
Mm-hm.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.553
Scanlon?

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:37.268
Billy, for chrissakes,
you must be committed, right?

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:39.437
No-- No-- No.

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:43.358
Oh. Oh, man.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:44.859
You're just a young kid.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.987
What are you doing here?
You ought to be out in a convertible...

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:49.781
bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.

01:12:49.948 --> 01:12:51.407
What are you doing here,
for chrissake?

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:55.620
- What's so funny about that?
- Well...

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.707
Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing
but complain about how you can't...

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:03.544
stand it in this place here, and then
you haven't got the guts to walk out?

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:07.632
I mean, what do you think you are,
for chrissake? Crazy or something?

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.302
Well, you're not. You're not.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:14.889
You're no crazier than the average asshole
walking around on the streets.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:20.770
And that's it.
Jesus Christ, I can't even believe it.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:29.487
Those are very challenging observations
you made, Randall.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.658
I'm sure some of the men
would like to comment.

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.746
Mr. Scanlon?

01:13:39.998 --> 01:13:44.669
I wanna know why the dorm is locked
in the daytime and on weekends.

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:54.595
Yeah. I would like to know
about our cigarettes.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:58.683
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.811
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick,
and wait your turn.

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.524
Go ahead, sit down.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.202
To answer your question
about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon...

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.537
you know very well...

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:24.041
that if we left the door open, you'd just
go right back to bed after breakfast.

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:27.295
- Am I right?
- So what?

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:30.965
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.717
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:35.428
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:37.388
For chrissake.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.019
Cigarettes.

01:14:45.105 --> 01:14:48.191
Remember, Mr. Scanlon,
we've discussed many times...

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:52.737
that time spent in the company of others
is very therapeutic...

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:57.408
while time spent brooding alone
only increases a feeling of separation.

01:14:57.576 --> 01:14:58.993
You remember that, don't you?

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.537
Do you mean to say...

01:15:01.705 --> 01:15:03.664
it's sick to wanna be off by yourself?

01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:05.583
Miss Ratched?

01:15:07.294 --> 01:15:10.254
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down.

01:15:10.422 --> 01:15:12.715
- But I wanna know about--
- Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:15.051
I wanna--

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:18.513
- Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?
- It's my last one.

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:22.892
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.228
Look, I'm not running a charity ward, see?

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:26.896
Come on.

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:31.734
Look, I don't want his cigarettes,
and I don't want his or his or his...

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:37.240
or his or his or his or his or his, 
or even yours.

01:15:37.407 --> 01:15:42.203
Do you understand that?
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:46.916
I want my cigarettes.
I want mine, Miss Ratched.

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:49.210
What gives you the damn right...

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:52.713
to keep our cigarettes
piled up on your desk...

01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:56.884
and to squeeze out a pack
only when you feel like it, huh?

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:01.472
- Miss Ratched.
- Mr.-- Mr. Harding.

01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:05.476
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:08.271
- You surprise me.
- No, well, I lost my head. I'm sorry.

01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:12.483
I'm sorry, I didn't mean--
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:15.653
I didn't mean--
I'm really very sorry. Just forgot.

01:16:16.029 --> 01:16:17.446
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

01:16:17.614 --> 01:16:19.782
Miss Ratched!

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:24.245
- Yes, Mr. Cheswick?
- I asked you a question.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.373
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:31.294
and I will answer your question
as soon as you've calmed down.

01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:33.296
Okay.

01:16:35.716 --> 01:16:38.175
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?

01:16:38.343 --> 01:16:40.636
- I'm calm.
- Good.

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:44.181
Now, as you all know...

01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:48.519
Mr. McMurphy has been running
a small gambling casino in our tub room.

01:16:49.896 --> 01:16:52.773
Now, most of you lost
all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...

01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:58.237
not to mention a tidy sum of money
to Mr. McMurphy.

01:16:58.405 --> 01:16:59.864
And that's why...

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:03.367
your tub-room privileges
have been suspended...

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:07.371
and your cigarettes
have been rationed.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:11.667
Mr. Martini?

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:14.837
How we gonna win our money back?

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:23.220
You're not going to win
your money back, Mr. Martini.

01:17:23.388 --> 01:17:25.264
That's all over.

01:17:25.432 --> 01:17:27.725
If you had obeyed the rules
in the first place...

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.852
- you wouldn't have lost your money.
- Oh!

01:17:39.112 --> 01:17:41.739
Sit down, gentlemen.
Sit down, gentlemen.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.949
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Oh! Oh!

01:17:44.117 --> 01:17:48.913
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:53.084
Rules? Piss on your fucking rules,
Miss Ratched.

01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:54.710
Sit down, will you, Cheswick?

01:17:54.878 --> 01:17:57.505
I want you to know something
here and now, Miss Ratched.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:01.008
- I ain't no little kid. I ain't no little kid...
- You sit down.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:04.303
where you're gonna have cigarettes
kept from me like cookies...

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:06.972
and I want something done!
Ain't that right, Mac?

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:13.521
- That's right. Now, will you sit down?
- I won't! I won't! I want something done!

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.523
- Sit down.
- I want something done!

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.733
- I want something done!
- Mr. Washington!

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.151
I want something done!

01:18:19.319 --> 01:18:22.405
I want something done!

01:18:22.572 --> 01:18:25.700
I want something done!
I want something done!

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.952
- Here. Here.
- I want something done!

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.539
Goddamn it, Cheswick, here. 
Hey, calm down.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:35.501
Why don't you leave him alone,
Washington? He's gonna be all right.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:49.306
Emergency 34-B, 34-B.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:53.728
I'm gonna break your fucking back.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:56.772
Punk-ass motherfucker.

01:18:59.651 --> 01:19:02.987
Forget it.
It's all over, McMurphy.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:06.449
Warren! Warren!

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.619
Warren.

01:19:46.364 --> 01:19:48.532
Would you move, please?
We need this chair.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.535
Just move right over there, okay.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:58.292
I see we have Mr. Bromden back.
Yeah, okay.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.044
Don't bother anyone.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.962
- Mr. McMurphy.
- Mr. McMurphy.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:05.216
- How do you do, Mr. McMurphy?
- I do real fine.

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:07.718
I know you didn't do anything wrong.
Just sit down.

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:11.013
We're not going to hurt you.
Sit down, right here. That's it.

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:13.599
Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick.
He's a little upset.

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:15.935
Okay, fine. Thank you very much.

01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:18.312
- You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick.
- Yes.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.857
Would you keep an eye on these three?

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:14.285
Would you please take these, gentlemen?

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:16.954
He can't hear nothing.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.292
That's it.

01:21:25.088 --> 01:21:26.255
Calm down, Ches, will you?

01:21:26.673 --> 01:21:29.717
Mr. Cheswick, would you please follow me?

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.554
Mr. Cheswick?

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:39.435
Mac. Mac.

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:41.395
- No!
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.856
- No!
- It'll be all right, Ches.

01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:46.233
- No!
- You're all right. No one's gonna hurt you.

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:47.443
No, leave me alone.

01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:52.239
- Make it easy on yourself.
- No. Mac. Mac.

01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:56.660
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.

01:21:56.828 --> 01:22:00.831
- Come on.
- No. I didn't do nothing.

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:03.500
Mac. No!

01:22:03.668 --> 01:22:10.090
- Come on.
- I won't go. I don't wanna go. I won't go.

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:19.183
Jesus Christ.

01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:24.855
All right, then.

01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:31.070
Want some gum?

01:22:34.824 --> 01:22:35.866
Thank you.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.225
Ah, Juicy Fruit.

01:23:02.727 --> 01:23:07.523
Well, you sly son of a bitch, Chief. Ha!

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:14.279
- Can you hear me too?
- Yeah, you bet.

01:23:14.447 --> 01:23:18.242
Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief.

01:23:19.744 --> 01:23:24.206
And they all-- They all think
you're deaf and dumb.

01:23:24.916 --> 01:23:26.959
Jesus Christ.

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:31.088
You fooled them, Chief.

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:35.092
You fooled them. You fooled them all.
Goddamn.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:42.850
What are we doing in here, Chief? Huh?

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:46.103
What's us two guys
doing in this fucking place?

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:56.363
Let's get out of here.

01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:59.283
Out.

01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:07.624
- Canada?
- Canada.

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:12.379
We'll be there before these
son of a bitches know what hit them.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:16.300
Listen to Randall on this one.

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:39.073
- Mr. McMurphy?
- Huh?

01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:41.700
Please follow me.

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:48.332
You and me, Chief.

01:24:59.969 --> 01:25:02.638
Take a cigarette break, boys. 
Easy.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:10.646
I'll be fine, thank you. 
Seated.

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:13.899
Ah.

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:17.236
- Would you sit up, please?
- Sure. Love to.

01:25:17.403 --> 01:25:18.570
Attaboy.

01:25:18.738 --> 01:25:22.533
There might be a little fluid in them boots,
you know what I mean, boys?

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.618
Just a little leak.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.537
A light shine, boys...

01:25:26.746 --> 01:25:29.998
and send the specimen
to Nurse Ratched.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.045
Huh?

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:39.883
- All right, out with your gum.
- Hmm?

01:25:40.051 --> 01:25:41.885
Out with your gum.

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:48.392
Okay, this won't hurt,
and it'll be over in just a moment.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.560
Uh-huh.

01:25:49.727 --> 01:25:51.562
- What's that?
- Conductant.

01:25:51.729 --> 01:25:53.355
A little dab will do you.

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.566
Ain't that right, Mr. Jackson?

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:58.735
Open your mouth.

01:25:59.028 --> 01:26:01.572
- What's that?
- Keep you from biting your tongue.

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:03.991
Now just bite down on it.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:07.411
That's right. Just bite down.
Now, bite down on it.

01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:15.711
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:20.424
Here we go.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.957
Now, one big breath.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.589
Very good.

01:27:03.176 --> 01:27:06.386
Gentlemen, I'd like to begin today.
It shouldn't take too long.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.100
Jim, it's been brought to my attention...

01:27:12.268 --> 01:27:15.979
that you've been giving Mr. Fredrickson
your medication.

01:27:16.147 --> 01:27:17.481
Is that true?

01:27:23.112 --> 01:27:24.988
No, ma'am.

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:27.824
Jim...

01:27:27.992 --> 01:27:30.869
are you giving your medication
to Mr. Fredrickson...

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:33.163
or are you not?

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:10.534
How about it, you creeps,
you lunatics, mental defectives.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:15.372
Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall,
back in action. Nice shirt, Cheseroo.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:22.713
Look at the faces on you. 
Look at you.

01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:25.465
The feebs' brigade, you ding-a-lings.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:29.428
The mental defective league in formation.

01:28:30.888 --> 01:28:34.224
How are you, Nurse Ratched?
I'm happy to be back.

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:38.729
- We're happy to have you back, Randall.
- Thank you.

01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:42.399
Would you like to rest today,
or would you like to join the group?

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:46.236
Uh...
Oh, I'd love to join the group.

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:47.696
I'd like...

01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:50.866
I'm proud to join the group, 
Mildred. Ahem.

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:55.912
- How--? How's it going, Mac?
- Perfect, Billy boy. Absolutely perfect.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.792
They was giving me 10,000 watts a day,
you know, and I'm hot to trot.

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.879
Next woman takes me on
is gonna light up like a pinball machine...

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:05.422
and pay off in silver dollars.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.262
Well, that's an amusing thought, Randall...

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:15.307
but when you came in,
we were talking to Jim.

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:20.062
He has a problem with his medication,
and we'd like to get back to that.

01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:22.647
Oh, I don't mind at all, Nurse Ratched.

01:29:22.815 --> 01:29:27.069
I'm, uh, gentle as a puppy dog and...

01:29:27.236 --> 01:29:29.988
Please proceed. Thank you.

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:33.617
<i>The administration was hopeful 
but cautious Friday...</i>

01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:36.953

Yeah, baby, it's Mac.

It's on tonight.

01:31:13.509 --> 01:31:14.926
Don't worry about it.

01:31:15.094 --> 01:31:17.929
Don't worry about it. 
Get a car.

01:31:18.097 --> 01:31:21.391
I don't give a shit, baby.
Steal it if you have to.

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:23.560
I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:26.730
Uh, don't forget to bring some booze. 
Right.

01:31:26.898 --> 01:31:28.565
Bye.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:21.451
Chief.

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:24.871
Chief, I can't take it no more.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:26.957
I gotta get out of here.

01:32:31.921 --> 01:32:34.714
I can't. I just can't.

01:32:35.925 --> 01:32:37.884
It's easier than you think, Chief.

01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:43.306
For you, maybe.
You're a lot bigger than me.

01:32:45.142 --> 01:32:48.645
Why, Chief, you're about as big
as a goddamn tree trunk.

01:32:54.527 --> 01:32:57.487
My papa's real big.

01:32:57.947 --> 01:33:00.657
He did like he pleased.

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:03.952
That's why everybody worked on him.

01:33:06.163 --> 01:33:11.334
The last time I seen my father
he was blind in the cedars from drinking.

01:33:11.502 --> 01:33:14.337
And every time he put
the bottle to his mouth...

01:33:14.505 --> 01:33:16.548
he don't suck out of it.

01:33:16.716 --> 01:33:20.385
It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk...

01:33:20.553 --> 01:33:24.347
so wrinkled and yellow,
even the dogs don't know him.

01:33:25.182 --> 01:33:26.600
Killed him, huh?

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.563
I'm not saying they killed him.

01:33:31.731 --> 01:33:36.610
They just worked on him,
the way they're working on you.

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:48.371
There they are, Chief.
There they are. They're here.

01:34:01.677 --> 01:34:05.221
Hey. Hey. Over here. 
That's it.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.807
McMurphy, stop all this holy-roller shit...

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:10.226
and get your ass back in bed.
You understand?

01:34:10.853 --> 01:34:15.857
Well, uh, my prayers
have been answered, Turkle.

01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:18.443
Come on and see.

01:34:26.243 --> 01:34:28.662
You'd take, uh, $20...

01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:32.624
to get down on your knees and pray, 
wouldn't you, Turkle?

01:34:33.125 --> 01:34:35.001
No, it don't send me, don't send me.

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:36.920
- It don't?
- Don't do nothing to me, no.

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:39.422
Well, you know there'll be more.

01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:44.678
I mean, uh, they'll be bringing
a couple of bottles with them, and, uh...

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:47.931
You're getting closer, brother.
You're getting closer...

01:34:49.433 --> 01:34:53.436
but they gonna be sharing
more than just bottles, ain't they?

01:34:53.604 --> 01:34:55.605
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:57.691
- I know what you mean.
- You understand?

01:34:57.858 --> 01:35:00.527
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:03.113
- Anything you say, Turkle.
- I'm on my knees, brother.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.116
- Yeah, all right, all right.
- I'm on my knees.

01:35:06.283 --> 01:35:07.450
- All right.
- Let them in.

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:13.289
- Let me give you a hand here.
- I appreciate that.

01:35:13.457 --> 01:35:14.916
- Hi.
- Ladies.

01:35:15.084 --> 01:35:18.294
Oh, thank you. I believe
this is your department, Mr. Turkle.

01:35:18.462 --> 01:35:20.547
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi, Rose, how you doing?

01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:23.049
- Love to give her a hand.
- Ow!

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:25.552
- Keep it down.
- Shh.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.263
- I split my pants.
- Keep it down.

01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:32.183
- Give it to me. Give it all to me.
- You got to keep it down.

01:35:32.351 --> 01:35:33.643
- Hi.
- Mm.

01:35:34.437 --> 01:35:35.937
This looks like my high school.

01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:38.398
Shh.

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.567
Oh, hey, I take that.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:42.444
- The barber chair.
- You may have it.

01:35:42.611 --> 01:35:43.987
It is mine, mine.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:46.114
You can have it.
You can have it, honey.

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:48.450
Ooh.

01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:52.328
- Take a load of these tubs.
- Real nice place you got here, Mac.

01:35:52.496 --> 01:35:53.663
Ooh. Ooh.

01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:58.001
- Hey, can I take a bath?
- Sure, you can take a bath. Sure.

01:35:58.169 --> 01:36:00.628
Just don't drown
your pretty little self.

01:36:00.796 --> 01:36:02.088
You know, um...

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:06.176
Rose was married to a maniac once,
up in Beaverton.

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:10.263
Oh, really, miss?
What seemed to be the problem?

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:14.976
Oh, nothing, he used to put frogs
in my bra all the time.

01:36:17.354 --> 01:36:20.315
Very interesting.

01:36:20.483 --> 01:36:22.609
- Uh, Mr. Turkle.
- Uh-huh?

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:27.197
Uh, Rose is very interested
in hospitals and hospital facilities.

01:36:27.364 --> 01:36:29.741
- I am?
- Yes. Oh, yes, you are.

01:36:29.909 --> 01:36:32.035
- I'm going to take Candy--
- Where you going?

01:36:32.203 --> 01:36:34.662
Uh, I'm gonna take Candy for a stroll.

01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:36.372
I got you, I got you.

01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:39.334
- But just don't make too much noise.
- Not a peep, not a peep.

01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:40.710
Peep.

01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:43.046
- All right.
- Yes, that's right.

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:47.050
Now, you come over here, baby,
right over here.

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:51.054
- Candy?
- Don't worry about Candy, honey.

01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:53.223
Sit down and relax. Now...

01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:08.738
<i>Wake up, boys. Wake up.</i>

01:37:08.906 --> 01:37:11.825
<i>It's medication time.</i>

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:14.327
<i>Medication time.</i>

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:16.538
<i>The nighttime spirits are here.</i>

01:37:16.705 --> 01:37:18.915
<i>It's Randall to say goodbye...</i>

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:24.420
<i>and get you high,
and nighttime angel, Candy. Oh, yes.</i>

01:37:24.588 --> 01:37:28.258
<i>That's right, Mr. Martini,
there is an Easter bunny.</i>

01:37:37.768 --> 01:37:42.272
<i>Round the side, boys. Join Mr. McMurphy
in the executive lounge, please.</i>

01:37:42.439 --> 01:37:43.439
<i>Round the side.</i>

01:37:47.987 --> 01:37:50.363
It's gonna be so great.

01:37:50.656 --> 01:37:54.033
You like a nip, don't you, Charles?
No trouble at all.

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:58.162
It's Billy the Club of the fabulous
and fantastic 14--

01:37:58.330 --> 01:38:01.457
- What the hell's going on?
- Mr. Turkle.

01:38:04.003 --> 01:38:05.753
Ain't this a bitch.

01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:09.007
McMurphy, what you trying to do?
Get my ass really fired, man?

01:38:09.174 --> 01:38:11.843
Come on, get your ass out of here.
Ain't this a-- Come on.

01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:13.219
We're just having a party.

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:16.097
Party, my ass. This ain't no nightclub,
this is a hospital.

01:38:16.473 --> 01:38:20.727
Man, this is my fucking job.
I don't give a damn, this is my fucking job.

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:26.482
Oh, shit. The supervisor.
Come on, get your asses back in there.

01:38:26.650 --> 01:38:29.152
Come on. Come on there.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:33.656
Where is that no-talking son of a bitch?
Is he in there? Good. Come on.

01:38:58.474 --> 01:39:05.521
Mr. Turkle?

01:39:07.524 --> 01:39:10.693
Where the hell is he?
Why doesn't he answer?

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:12.528
He's jerking off somewhere.

01:39:13.864 --> 01:39:15.865
Ain't nobody jerking off nowhere, 
motherfucker.

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:17.909
Turkle, what the fuck
are you doing here?

01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:19.369
Go out there and talk to her.

01:39:19.536 --> 01:39:22.664
Doing the same fucking thing
you're doing in here, hiding.

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.210
Yes, ma'am?

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:32.715
- Everything all right, Mr. Turkle?
- Oh, everything is just fine, ma'am.

01:39:32.883 --> 01:39:34.342
Just fine. Just fine.

01:39:44.061 --> 01:39:45.687
Who's there?

01:39:46.438 --> 01:39:49.857
- Ain't nobody in there.
- Please open that door.

01:39:55.531 --> 01:39:56.906
Oh. Heh-heh-heh.

01:39:57.074 --> 01:39:58.741
I'm sorry. Heh-heh-heh.

01:39:58.909 --> 01:40:00.326
Heh.

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:08.042
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you know,
a man gets awful lonesome at night.

01:40:08.210 --> 01:40:13.089
You understand what I mean, don't you?
You understand? I'm sure you understand.

01:40:13.257 --> 01:40:17.677
I want that woman
off this ward immediately.

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:22.098
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

01:40:41.744 --> 01:40:43.786
- Jesus.
- Mr. Turkle, is she gone?

01:40:43.954 --> 01:40:45.705
Shit, yeah, she's gone, and so am I.

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:47.957
Get your behinds out of here
and back to bed.

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:50.168
Go ahead, move it, move it. 
Move it.

01:40:50.335 --> 01:40:52.086
- I knew we were in trouble.
- Let's go.

01:40:52.254 --> 01:40:55.298
You and your teddy-bear ass.
Move them on out of here.

01:40:55.466 --> 01:40:56.924
Come on, come on.

01:40:57.092 --> 01:40:58.760
- Candy?
- Come on, Candy.

01:40:58.927 --> 01:41:00.928
Jesus Christ.

01:41:01.096 --> 01:41:02.764
Mr. Turkle, I'm really sorry.

01:41:02.931 --> 01:41:05.433
Motherfuckers fucking with my job.

01:41:05.601 --> 01:41:07.518
- Get out.
- I'm really sorry.

01:41:07.686 --> 01:41:08.811
What are you...?

01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:10.730
What the fuck--?
Get out of here.

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:14.400
Please get out, this is my job.
You fucking it up. You understand?

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:16.235
Get out.

01:41:16.403 --> 01:41:18.654
Get out of here,
you slim motherfucker.

01:41:20.449 --> 01:41:24.202
Fuck it.

01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:40.301
Good night, good night,
don't let the cooties bite.

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:55.316
There.

01:41:55.484 --> 01:41:59.320
Make you get up and dance. Okay?

01:42:06.912 --> 01:42:09.330
Right out of the Shock Department.
I got it from--

01:42:09.498 --> 01:42:11.040
I got it from Ratched's charts.

01:42:11.208 --> 01:42:15.378
Right. There you go, there you go.
Easy now. Don't take it all at once.

01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:18.339
Let's try a little over here.
There you go.

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:05.488
Let's go.

01:44:10.786 --> 01:44:13.788
I'll have to be the one, Chief.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.181
Hey, Mac, what's going on? Huh?

01:44:32.349 --> 01:44:36.852
Well, Dale, Lord Randall
is stepping down one.

01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:39.188
Fredrickson.

01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:41.941
Jimmy.

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:44.110
You gonna say 
goodbye to me, Mac?

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:47.405
Sure, I'm gonna say 
goodbye to you, Charles.

01:44:47.572 --> 01:44:49.991
- Hey, Mac? Mac?
- Yeah?

01:44:50.158 --> 01:44:53.494
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

01:44:53.662 --> 01:44:57.999
- I'll never forget you.
- Settle down, Charles, all right?

01:45:00.335 --> 01:45:02.670
Hey, Billy, what's wrong?

01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:06.382
Billy, for chrissake...

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.679
What's the matter?

01:45:14.558 --> 01:45:18.227
I'm-- I'm gonna--
Gonna miss you very, very...

01:45:18.395 --> 01:45:21.230
very, very much, Mac.

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:26.360
Well, why don't you come with us, then?

01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:30.448
Think-- Think I don't want to?

01:45:30.615 --> 01:45:36.454
- So come on, then, let's go.
- Well-- Well, it's not-- Not that easy.

01:45:38.957 --> 01:45:42.918
I'm not-- Not--
Not ready yet.

01:45:44.921 --> 01:45:46.255
Tell you what we'll do.

01:45:46.423 --> 01:45:48.674
When I get to Canada,
I'll write you a postcard...

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:51.427
and I'll put my address on it.

01:45:51.595 --> 01:45:55.014
That way when you are ready,
you'll know where to go.

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:57.350
What do you say?

01:45:59.644 --> 01:46:01.354
Yeah.

01:46:02.230 --> 01:46:08.944
Ma--? Mac? Is she--?
She going with you?

01:46:12.824 --> 01:46:13.949
Candy?

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:20.748
Yeah, she'll be there when you get there.
She's going with us.

01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:25.294
Are you gonna--?
Gonna marry her?

01:46:25.462 --> 01:46:30.049
No. No, we're just good friends. Why?

01:46:37.516 --> 01:46:39.058
No-- No-- Nothing.

01:46:39.226 --> 01:46:44.313
No-- No-- Don't "nothing" me, all right? 
What is it?

01:46:49.611 --> 01:46:55.783
Well, it's too-- Too late.

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:01.247
You want a date with her?

01:47:01.415 --> 01:47:02.540
No.

01:47:02.707 --> 01:47:08.337
Jesus, I must be crazy
to be in a loony bin like this.

01:47:08.505 --> 01:47:10.047
Date, huh?

01:47:10.215 --> 01:47:13.217
Well, it'll have to be a fast date,
I'll tell you that.

01:47:13.385 --> 01:47:18.431
No-- No-- Not now.

01:47:18.598 --> 01:47:19.807
Not now?

01:47:20.392 --> 01:47:21.434
When, then?

01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:27.982
Um-- Um--

01:47:29.526 --> 01:47:31.527
When I have a free weekend.

01:47:32.237 --> 01:47:36.240
You busy right now, are you?
You got something to do right now?

01:47:36.408 --> 01:47:37.950
- You got something to do?
- Uh, no-- No.

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:41.036
Good, then don't talk to me about
when you're ready. Yeah, yeah.

01:47:41.204 --> 01:47:42.955
- No. No.
- Ready and everything like that.

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:45.124
Candy, come here a minute.

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:48.794
Yes, yes, yes. Candy,
I want you to meet the famous Billy.

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:50.880
Go get him, will you?

01:47:51.047 --> 01:47:53.549
Go get him. 
Get him out of there.

01:47:53.717 --> 01:47:58.304
I want you to get ahold of Billy...

01:47:58.472 --> 01:48:00.514
All you gotta do
is this one little thing.

01:48:00.682 --> 01:48:03.726
- The kid's cute, isn't he? Huh?
- Yeah.

01:48:08.565 --> 01:48:11.233
Think of me the whole time.

01:48:11.735 --> 01:48:15.946
There he is. Billy the Club.

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:24.121
Billy, I got $25...

01:48:24.289 --> 01:48:28.000
that says you are gonna burn
this woman down.

01:48:29.586 --> 01:48:32.171
Oh, boy.

01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:36.258
Candy, baby...

01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:41.931
I love you.

01:48:42.098 --> 01:48:43.641
Hurl the ringer.

01:48:47.938 --> 01:48:52.024
Hey, easy. Back. Back. 
Come on.

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:53.275
That's enough.

01:48:53.443 --> 01:48:55.611
No, no, no,
I'll show you some card tricks.

01:48:55.779 --> 01:48:57.613
You ain't seen the Spanish deck yet.

01:48:57.781 --> 01:48:59.949
That's 40 percent more torture.

01:49:01.952 --> 01:49:04.286
Mr. Scanlon, I'm gonna present you...

01:49:04.454 --> 01:49:09.124
with this fine deck of cards
for playing.

01:49:11.294 --> 01:49:15.130
This ain't gonna take long, Rose,
you know what I mean?

01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:27.351
When we get to Canada...

01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:17.503
Out of sight, man. Out of sight.

01:51:33.603 --> 01:51:34.645
Morning, Miss Ratched.

01:51:34.813 --> 01:51:36.897
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:44.488
Mr. Warren, close the window
and lock the screen.

01:51:44.656 --> 01:51:46.824
Right.

01:52:11.307 --> 01:52:14.268
Mr. Miller, show this woman
the way out of the hospital.

01:52:14.436 --> 01:52:16.311
Gladly.

01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:19.106
- Come on, lady, let's go.
- Oh--

01:52:19.274 --> 01:52:20.649
- You're going home.
- Where?

01:52:20.817 --> 01:52:23.152
Let her go, Scanlon.
You're going home.

01:52:23.319 --> 01:52:24.945
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes, Miss Ratched.

01:52:25.113 --> 01:52:27.990
- Make sure no one is missing.
- Will do.

01:52:29.325 --> 01:52:30.993
- Mac?
- Come on, Scanlon, move.

01:52:31.161 --> 01:52:33.579
- Everybody out of here.
- Come on, move it out.

01:52:33.747 --> 01:52:36.790
Come on, move it.
Martini, get your butt up. Come on, up.

01:52:36.958 --> 01:52:38.834
Colonel, get your dead ass up there.

01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:41.837
What the hell's going on here?
Come on, move out.

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:51.847
- Move it out of there.
- Miss Ratched?

01:52:52.015 --> 01:52:55.184
Okay, Martini, let's go. 
Move it.

01:52:55.351 --> 01:52:58.187
- Fredrickson, what you doing?
- Where you going? Back out here.

01:52:58.354 --> 01:53:01.190
- Let's go. Go on, let's go.
- What the hell is that?

01:53:02.275 --> 01:53:06.320
Taber, get up. Come on.
I said, get up.

01:53:09.157 --> 01:53:13.869
Move it back there. McMurphy, get your ass 
over here, and bring Dracula with you.

01:53:14.037 --> 01:53:15.871
- Move it.
- Come on.

01:53:16.164 --> 01:53:18.040
Let's go. Let's go.

01:53:18.208 --> 01:53:20.250
Stay right there, Bancini.

01:53:20.835 --> 01:53:22.419
- Miss Ratched?
- Yes?

01:53:22.587 --> 01:53:24.755
Looks like Billy Bibbit's
the only one missing.

01:53:24.923 --> 01:53:26.840
- Billy?
- Mm-hm.

01:53:27.008 --> 01:53:29.927
- Thank you, Mr. Washington.
- Okay.

01:53:30.804 --> 01:53:34.765
Did Billy Bibbit leave the grounds
of the hospital, gentlemen?

01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:42.022
I want an answer to my question.

01:53:42.357 --> 01:53:45.484
Did he leave the grounds
of the hospital?

01:53:57.831 --> 01:53:59.289
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes.

01:53:59.457 --> 01:54:02.584
Miss Pilbow, check all the rooms.

01:54:02.752 --> 01:54:03.919
- Mr. Warren?
- Yes.

01:54:04.087 --> 01:54:06.755
You'll start with the tub room.

01:54:13.263 --> 01:54:14.429
Mr. Martini?

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:18.225
May I have my cap, please?

01:54:18.518 --> 01:54:23.105
My cap. My cap. There.

01:54:27.151 --> 01:54:28.402
Thank you.

01:54:54.053 --> 01:54:56.138
Miss Ratched.

01:55:31.382 --> 01:55:33.342
Miss Ratched...

01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:48.649
Um, I can explain everything.

01:55:48.816 --> 01:55:50.692
Please do, Billy.

01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:53.487
Explain everything.

01:55:56.324 --> 01:55:58.700
Everything?

01:56:00.119 --> 01:56:02.996
Aren't you ashamed?

01:56:04.832 --> 01:56:06.291
No, I'm not.

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:07.709
All right.

01:56:16.761 --> 01:56:18.887
You know, Billy, what worries me...

01:56:19.055 --> 01:56:22.224
is how your mother's
going to take this.

01:56:30.358 --> 01:56:32.401
Um... Um, well, you--

01:56:32.568 --> 01:56:36.238
You don't have to...

01:56:36.406 --> 01:56:39.491
tell her, Miss Ratched.

01:56:39.909 --> 01:56:41.326
I don't have to tell her?

01:56:43.246 --> 01:56:46.081
Your mother and I are old friends.
You know that.

01:56:54.215 --> 01:57:01.138
Um... Please do--
Don't tell my m--

01:57:01.305 --> 01:57:04.599
Don't you think you should have thought
of that before you took that woman...

01:57:04.767 --> 01:57:06.685
in that room?

01:57:14.944 --> 01:57:17.237
No, no.

01:57:18.281 --> 01:57:19.448
I--

01:57:22.285 --> 01:57:23.618
I didn't.

01:57:23.786 --> 01:57:26.955
You mean she dragged you 
in there by force?

01:57:34.839 --> 01:57:38.133
She-- She--

01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:43.096
She-- She did.

01:57:46.267 --> 01:57:51.438
- Everybody did.
- Everybody? Who did?

01:57:51.606 --> 01:57:53.607
You tell me who did.

01:58:08.956 --> 01:58:12.000
M-- M--

01:58:12.835 --> 01:58:15.796
M-- McMurphy.

01:58:18.341 --> 01:58:23.553
Miss Rat--
Miss Ratched, please don't...

01:58:23.721 --> 01:58:26.306
- tell my mother, please.
- Mr. Warren?

01:58:26.474 --> 01:58:29.226
Would you see that the men
are washed and ready for the day?

01:58:29.393 --> 01:58:34.022
Miss Ratched, please--
Please don't tell my mother.

01:58:34.190 --> 01:58:35.482
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes?

01:58:35.650 --> 01:58:38.360
- Put Billy in Dr. Spivey's office.
- No, no. No.

01:58:38.528 --> 01:58:41.446
- Stay with him till the doctor arrives.
- No, no, no.

01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:44.199
No, no. No.

01:58:46.244 --> 01:58:49.204
- Move it. Come on, Martini, get on.
- No.

01:58:49.372 --> 01:59:05.387
No! No! No!

01:59:11.894 --> 01:59:15.522
That way, please.
Please, gentlemen. Huh?

01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:18.191
Let's go, come on.
Come on, you guys. What is this?

01:59:18.359 --> 01:59:19.401
Let's go.

01:59:43.634 --> 01:59:45.385
Hey, what the hell is that?

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:48.597
McMurphy, what the hell are you doing?

01:59:50.266 --> 01:59:51.266
Aah!

01:59:53.227 --> 01:59:57.022
<i>Washington to the Day Room. 
Immediately.</i>

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:09.743
Put down those keys and nobody gets hurt.

02:00:19.587 --> 02:00:22.797
Move away from the window
and take that damn Chief with you.

02:00:32.391 --> 02:00:33.934
Mac?

02:00:34.644 --> 02:00:37.145
Come on, let's go.

02:00:45.321 --> 02:00:48.823
Let me through. Let me through.

02:00:52.286 --> 02:00:53.328
Oh.

02:00:59.502 --> 02:01:00.919
Out of the way, McMurphy.

02:01:04.799 --> 02:01:08.009
- Come on, clear it.
- Get these people out of here.

02:01:08.177 --> 02:01:10.553
- Oh, Billy.
- Will you guys clear the door?

02:01:10.721 --> 02:01:13.348
Everybody out. Out. 
Everybody out.

02:01:13.683 --> 02:01:16.351
Come on, goddamn it. 
Get your ass--

02:01:18.729 --> 02:01:20.021
Now calm down.

02:01:20.690 --> 02:01:23.900
The best thing we can do
is go on with our daily routine.

02:01:24.068 --> 02:01:26.528
All right?

02:01:26.696 --> 02:01:29.155
Mac. Don't.

02:01:32.868 --> 02:01:34.286
Don't. Mac.

02:01:38.082 --> 02:01:43.086
Mac. Don't. Mac. No.

02:01:43.754 --> 02:01:44.796
Don't.

02:02:19.582 --> 02:02:21.416
And the bets are placed.

02:02:21.584 --> 02:02:24.711
There's one for Tabes and Chessy
and Martini and the dealer.

02:02:24.879 --> 02:02:27.130
And a four to Tabes,
and a six and a nine...

02:02:27.298 --> 02:02:30.842
- and a 10 to the dealer.
- A nine? Nine?

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:33.094
What do you say, Tabes?

02:02:33.262 --> 02:02:34.763
A dime apiece.

02:02:34.930 --> 02:02:36.681
No? You stick.

02:02:36.849 --> 02:02:39.976
- He sticks.
- Sticks with a four.

02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:43.271
Chessy's going for the ride.

02:02:43.439 --> 02:02:45.231
- What does that mean?
- He wants a hit.

02:02:45.399 --> 02:02:47.067
He wants a hit.
And a big queen.

02:02:47.234 --> 02:02:48.443
I think you're busted.

02:02:48.611 --> 02:02:49.986
Buggered, not busted.

02:02:50.154 --> 02:02:51.696
- Turn them over.
- Buggered.

02:02:51.864 --> 02:02:52.947
And weep.

02:02:53.115 --> 02:02:55.325
- Hit me.
- Hit.

02:02:55.493 --> 02:02:57.035
I think you're over.

02:02:57.203 --> 02:02:58.244
I know you're over.

02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:00.872
That's a three.

02:03:12.802 --> 02:03:15.387
<i>Mr. Sefelt?</i>

02:03:15.805 --> 02:03:17.472
<i>Did everything go well?</i>

02:03:20.142 --> 02:03:24.562
<i>That's very nice.
Now you feel better, don't you?</i>

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:26.523
Yes, ma'am.

02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:29.818
Deuce to the dealer.

02:03:29.985 --> 02:03:32.112
Split them. Higher.

02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:35.323
McMurphy is out.

02:03:38.869 --> 02:03:40.829
McMurphy has escaped.

02:03:42.164 --> 02:03:44.165
They were taking him
through the tunnel.

02:03:44.333 --> 02:03:47.001
He beat up two of the attendants
and escaped.

02:03:47.503 --> 02:03:51.047
- McMurphy's upstairs.
- Oh, no, no, no.

02:03:51.215 --> 02:03:53.383
Jim, I'm telling you,
McMurphy is upstairs...

02:03:53.551 --> 02:03:55.343
and he's as meek as a lamb.

02:03:55.511 --> 02:03:58.346
Really? I mean, how do you know?

02:03:59.473 --> 02:04:03.017
- Jack Dunphy told me.
- Jack Dunphy's full of shit.

02:04:03.185 --> 02:04:06.688
- Ha.
- Right. Right.

02:04:54.403 --> 02:04:56.529
We got you.

02:04:58.115 --> 02:05:00.116
There you go.

02:05:55.172 --> 02:05:56.881
Mac.

02:05:58.050 --> 02:06:00.802
They said you escaped.

02:06:01.929 --> 02:06:06.808
I knew you wouldn't leave without me.
I was waiting for you.

02:06:06.976 --> 02:06:12.188
Now we can make it, Mac.
I feel big as a damn mountain.

02:06:29.999 --> 02:06:31.833
Oh, no.

02:07:03.032 --> 02:07:06.034
I'm not going without you, Mac.

02:07:07.953 --> 02:07:11.205
I wouldn't leave you here this way.

02:07:20.424 --> 02:07:23.217
You're coming with me.

02:07:43.906 --> 02:07:45.406
Let's go.

02:13:36.008 --> 02:13:38.009
