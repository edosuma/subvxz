THE GREAT GATSBY
Transcript and sync: jcdr V3 — 10.10.2013

01:10.075 --> 01:13.707
<i>In my younger and more vulnerable years,</i>

01:14.173 --> 01:17.521
<i>my father gave me some advice.</i>

01:19.292 --> 01:23.443
<i>"Always try to see the best
in people", he would say.</i>

01:25.030 --> 01:30.402
<i>As a consequence, I'm inclined
to reserve all judgments.</i>

01:31.717 --> 01:34.959
<i>But even I have a limit.</i>

01:37.844 --> 01:42.201
<i>Back then, all of us drank too much.</i>

01:43.226 --> 01:47.018
<i>The more in tune with the times we were,</i>

01:47.578 --> 01:50.873
<i>the more we drank.</i>

01:50.954 --> 01:55.039
<i>And none of us contributed anything new.</i>

01:57.300 --> 02:00.760
When I came back from
New York, I was disgusted.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.576
I see, Mr. Carraway.

02:06.105 --> 02:10.579
Disgusted with everyone,
and everything.

02:11.820 --> 02:15.608
Only one man was exempt from my disgust.

02:19.683 --> 02:23.351
One man… Mr. Carraway?

02:27.726 --> 02:29.717
Gatsby.

02:32.221 --> 02:34.401
Was he a friend of yours?

02:36.432 --> 02:38.774
He was…

02:39.397 --> 02:44.091
the single most hopeful
person I've ever met,

02:44.722 --> 02:48.393
and I'm ever likely to meet again.

02:50.225 --> 02:54.993
There was something about him,
a sensitivity. He was like…

02:56.491 --> 03:00.978
he was like one of those machines that
register earthquakes 10,000 miles away.

03:02.477 --> 03:04.620
Where did you meet him?

03:09.388 --> 03:11.920
At a… at a party.

03:13.002 --> 03:17.265
In New York.
<i>In the summer 1922,</i>

03:17.372 --> 03:21.763
<i>the tempo of the city approached…
hysteria.</i>

03:34.322 --> 03:36.870
<i>Stocks reached record peaks,</i>

03:36.930 --> 03:42.057
<i>and Wall Street boomed
in a steady golden roar.</i>

03:42.128 --> 03:44.449
<i>The parties were bigger.</i>

03:44.644 --> 03:46.752
<i>The shows were broader.</i>

03:46.920 --> 03:49.153
<i>The buildings were higher.</i>

03:49.581 --> 03:54.062
<i>The models were looser, and
the ban on alcohol had backfired,</i>

03:54.370 --> 03:57.145
<i>making the liquor cheaper.</i>

04:01.814 --> 04:05.694
<i>Wall Street was luring
the young and ambitious,</i>

04:06.949 --> 04:09.674
<i>and I was one of them.</i>

04:12.990 --> 04:16.009
<i>I rented a house twenty miles
from the city on Long Island.</i>

04:16.226 --> 04:19.849
<i>I lived in West Egg, in a forgotten
groundskeeper's cottage,</i>

04:19.983 --> 04:23.463
<i>squeezed among the mansions
of the newly rich.</i>

04:23.925 --> 04:28.230
<i>To get started, I bought a dozen volumes
on credit banking and investment,</i>

04:28.304 --> 04:30.150
<i>all new to me.</i>

04:30.175 --> 04:31.621
<i>The stock market hit another high.</i>

04:31.647 --> 04:33.002
The market's moving up, up, up!

04:33.080 --> 04:36.393
Well, of course, nothing is 100%.
Though I wouldn't go investing every penny.

04:37.377 --> 04:41.890
<i>At Yale, I dreamed of being a writer.
But I gave all that up.</i>

04:42.542 --> 04:46.165
<i>With the sun shining and the
bursts of leaves on the trees,</i>

04:46.192 --> 04:48.761
<i>I planned to spend
the summer studying.</i>

04:49.926 --> 04:56.606
<i>And I probably would have, were it not
for the riotous amusements that beckoned,</i>

04:59.728 --> 05:04.414
<i>from beyond the walls
of that colossal castle,</i>

05:05.394 --> 05:09.765
<i>owned by a gentleman I had not yet met,</i>

05:10.030 --> 05:12.788
<i>named Gatsby.</i>

05:14.157 --> 05:17.410
So, he was your neighbor?

05:17.679 --> 05:21.025
My neighbor…
Yeah.

05:22.356 --> 05:26.153
<i>When I think about it,
the history of the summer really began</i>

05:26.177 --> 05:30.201
<i>the night I drove over
to my cousin Daisy's for diner.</i>

05:30.234 --> 05:37.619
<i>She lived across the bay
in old moneyed East Egg.</i>

05:42.273 --> 05:46.389
<i>Her husband was heir to one of
America's wealthiest families.</i>

05:47.128 --> 05:51.055
<i>His name was Tom Buchanan.</i>

05:53.743 --> 05:56.903
<i>When we were at Yale together,
he'd been a sporting star.</i>

05:57.071 --> 06:00.461
<i>Now his glory days were behind him,
and he contented himself with—</i>

06:00.526 --> 06:02.209
— Telephone, Monsieur Buchanan.
— It's me.

06:02.611 --> 06:06.311
<i>…other affairs.</i>
— I thought I told you not to call me here.

06:06.319 --> 06:07.345
Boaz!

06:08.180 --> 06:11.258
— Shakespeare!
— Tom!

06:12.353 --> 06:14.267
How is the great American novel coming?

06:14.321 --> 06:16.460
I'm selling bonds now, with
Walter Chase's outfit.

06:16.615 --> 06:18.847
Let's say, after diner,
you and I we go into town.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.915
— I can't.
— Catch up with the ol'wolf pack.

06:21.202 --> 06:24.019
— Big day on the job tomorrow.
— Nonsense! We're going.

06:24.073 --> 06:26.546
First team, all American.

06:26.632 --> 06:28.870
See? Made me who I am today.

06:29.023 --> 06:32.504
Forest Hills, played the Prince of Wales.
What a sissy!

06:32.992 --> 06:37.121
Live is something you dominate, Nick!
If you're any good.

07:01.857 --> 07:03.689
Henry! Where are you?

07:04.136 --> 07:05.308
Oui, Monsieur.

07:05.476 --> 07:07.567
The doors! Close them.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.124
Allez!

07:10.227 --> 07:12.476
Sorry. Thank you.

07:13.068 --> 07:15.599
Is that you, my lovely?

07:19.095 --> 07:22.680
<i>Daisy Buchanan. The Golden Girl.</i>

07:23.035 --> 07:25.224
<i>A breathless warmth flowed from her.</i>

07:25.296 --> 07:29.471
<i>A promise that there was no one else
in the world she so wanted to see.</i>

07:30.098 --> 07:31.962
Do they miss me in Chicago?

07:31.963 --> 07:33.493
Uh yes, huh, uhm…

07:34.117 --> 07:36.425
At least a dozen people send their love.

07:36.479 --> 07:38.330
How gorgeous.

07:38.538 --> 07:40.449
They're absolutely in mourning.

07:40.450 --> 07:42.789
They're crying. Yes, they're wailing.
— No. I don't believe it.

07:42.843 --> 07:44.711
— I don't believe you.
— They're screaming, they're shouting,

07:44.772 --> 07:46.964
"Daisy Buchanan,
we can't live without you!"

07:47.346 --> 07:50.084
I'm paralyzed with happiness!

07:55.012 --> 07:58.138
Jordan Baker, a very famous golfer.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.792
<i>She was the most frightening
person I'd ever seen.</i>

08:01.934 --> 08:05.891
Well I— I've seen your face on the cover
of Sporting Life. Nick Carraway.

08:06.501 --> 08:08.719
But I enjoyed looking at her.

08:08.809 --> 08:12.044
I've been lying on that sofa
for as long as I can remember.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.611
This summer, I'll fling
you two together,

08:14.640 --> 08:17.015
I'll push you into linen closets,
and out to sea in boats!

08:17.090 --> 08:18.641
I'm not listening to a word.

08:18.679 --> 08:21.891
So Nick, Daisy tells me
that you're over in West Egg.

08:22.474 --> 08:25.993
Throwing your lot in with those
social climbing primitive new money types.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.662
My little shack's just a cardboard
box at $80 a month.

08:28.699 --> 08:29.981
Your life is adorable.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.861
I know somebody in West Egg.

08:31.986 --> 08:34.116
I don't know a single person
that side of the bay.

08:34.163 --> 08:36.522
Oh! You must know Gatsby.

08:37.519 --> 08:39.522
Gatsby?

08:43.086 --> 08:44.342
What Gatsby?

08:44.343 --> 08:47.065
Madame, the dîner is servi.

08:58.415 --> 09:00.158
Would you like to hear a family secret?

09:00.226 --> 09:01.639
That's why I came over.

09:01.647 --> 09:02.846
It's about the butler's nose.

09:02.847 --> 09:04.459
Things went from bad to worse.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.776
I hate that word, "hulking".

09:05.860 --> 09:09.241
Nicky, I heard a rumor that you were
getting married to a girl out West.

09:09.339 --> 09:10.741
It's a libel. I'm too poor.

09:10.776 --> 09:12.558
They have to be old so they die quickly.

09:12.588 --> 09:14.120
Can't we talk about something else?

09:14.153 --> 09:15.494
— We ought to have plans.
— Anything. Crops.

09:15.525 --> 09:17.629
You're making me feel uncivilized, Daisy.

09:17.656 --> 09:19.109
Civilization's going to pieces.

09:20.723 --> 09:23.202
Have you read "The Rise
of the Colored Empires"?

09:23.330 --> 09:26.579
By this fellow, Goddard.
Everyone ought to read it.

09:26.860 --> 09:30.749
The idea is that it's up
to us, the dominant race,

09:30.895 --> 09:35.080
to watch out or these other races
will have control of things.

09:35.136 --> 09:36.994
Tom's very profound lately.

09:37.106 --> 09:39.269
He reads deep books with
long words in them.

09:39.551 --> 09:41.376
It's been proved. Scientific.

09:41.603 --> 09:44.112
We've got to beat them down.

09:52.331 --> 09:54.770
Buchanan residence?

09:55.138 --> 09:59.368
Monsieur Wilson from the garage.
Monsieur Buchanan?

09:59.431 --> 10:02.400
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

10:05.255 --> 10:07.158
I'm sorry.

10:09.248 --> 10:13.530
Well. This, huh, this Mr. Gatsby
you spoke of. He's my neighbor.

10:13.805 --> 10:16.854
Don't talk. I wanna hear what happens.

10:16.879 --> 10:18.217
<i>I don't care what you do…</i>

10:18.218 --> 10:19.327
Something happening?

10:19.328 --> 10:20.845
Why, I thought everybody knew.

10:20.880 --> 10:21.886
Well, I don't.

10:22.008 --> 10:24.309
Tom's got some
woman in New York.

10:24.353 --> 10:25.164
Got some woman?

10:25.291 --> 10:29.623
She might have the decency not to
telephone at diner time. Don't you think?

10:30.448 --> 10:32.948
- Is that too much to ask?
- Daisy, don't create a scene.

10:33.664 --> 10:37.426
I love seeing you at my table, Nicky.
You remind me of a rose.

10:37.668 --> 10:39.692
An absolute rose, doesn't he?
— So, after diner…

10:39.693 --> 10:42.601
— Well, I'm not even faintly like a rose.
— Nick wanted to go into town.

10:42.614 --> 10:43.887
Right, Nick? To the Yale club.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.958
— Nicky. Stay!
— I have to work early.

10:46.026 --> 10:48.398
— Nonsense.
— There's so much to talk about.

10:48.673 --> 10:50.530
It's just for a drink or two.

10:56.703 --> 11:02.130
None of us could ignore that
fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.989
— Oh! Nicky.
— What?

11:06.104 --> 11:10.131
It's just… Oh you see, I think
everything's terrible anyhow.

11:11.012 --> 11:12.638
— Really?
— Yes.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.368
I've been everywhere and seen
everything and done everything.

11:16.589 --> 11:21.506
I've had a very bad time, Nicky.
I'm pretty cynical about everything.

11:25.934 --> 11:29.246
Your daughter, I suppose she talks
and eats and everything?

11:29.316 --> 11:30.781
Pammy?

11:31.364 --> 11:33.070
Oh, yes.

11:33.180 --> 11:38.347
Listen, Nick. When she was born, Tom was…

11:38.537 --> 11:41.379
God knows where.

11:45.616 --> 11:47.956
With God knows whom.

11:48.038 --> 11:52.431
And I asked the nurse if
it was a boy or a girl.

11:53.688 --> 11:57.287
And she said it was a girl.
And I wept.

11:57.913 --> 12:00.669
I'm glad it's a girl.

12:02.081 --> 12:04.851
And I hope she'll be a fool.

12:04.886 --> 12:08.098
That's the best thing a
girl in this world can be.

12:09.190 --> 12:11.760
A beautiful little fool.

12:14.284 --> 12:18.838
All the bright, precious things
fade so fast.

12:20.686 --> 12:22.984
And they don't come back.

12:53.633 --> 12:58.932
<i>When I arrived home, I noticed that a
figure had emerged on my neighbor's dock.</i>

13:04.504 --> 13:07.349
<i>And something told me it was…</i>

13:07.602 --> 13:10.124
<i>Mr. Gatsby.</i>

13:17.443 --> 13:21.987
<i>He seemed to be reaching towards
something out there in the dark.</i>

13:34.992 --> 13:37.130
<i>The green light.</i>

13:42.025 --> 13:44.458
I don't wanna talk about this, doctor.

13:44.633 --> 13:47.027
Then write about it.

13:47.710 --> 13:50.218
— Write about it?
— Yes.

13:50.925 --> 13:52.877
Why would I do that?

13:52.878 --> 13:56.379
You said yourself writing
brought you solace.

13:56.479 --> 14:01.382
Yeah well… it didn't bring
anyone else much solace.

14:01.785 --> 14:03.895
I wasn't any good.

14:03.929 --> 14:08.602
No one need ever read it.
You could always burn it.

14:12.969 --> 14:15.957
— What would I write about?
— Anything.

14:17.225 --> 14:19.432
Whatever brings you ease.

14:19.661 --> 14:24.249
A memory. A thought. A place.

14:25.968 --> 14:28.100
Write it down.

14:31.908 --> 14:33.490
A place…

14:39.266 --> 14:43.193
The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place.

14:45.350 --> 14:49.914
<i>New York's dumping ground half way
between West Egg and the city,</i>

14:49.940 --> 14:56.497
<i>where the burnt out coal that powered the
booming golden city was discarded by men,</i>

14:56.532 --> 15:02.538
<i>who moved dimly and already
crumbling through the powdery air.</i>

15:02.626 --> 15:07.436
<i>This Fantastic Farm was ever
watched by Dr. T.J. Eckleburg.</i>

15:07.466 --> 15:11.585
<i>A forgotten oculist whose
eyes brooded over it all.</i>

15:11.919 --> 15:14.981
<i>Like the eyes of God.</i>

15:16.956 --> 15:20.784
<i>Tom had invited me to town.
Apparently for lunch at the Yale club.</i>

15:21.139 --> 15:25.375
<i>But the day took an unexpected turn.</i>

15:26.376 --> 15:27.827
Come on.

15:27.942 --> 15:29.435
— Come on!
— What do you mean?

15:29.555 --> 15:31.940
— Trust me!
— What are we doing?

15:32.090 --> 15:34.036
— Hey, where are you going?
— Jump!

15:34.062 --> 15:35.981
— What are you doing?
— Come on!

15:35.999 --> 15:38.125
— Tom!
— Come on!

15:38.201 --> 15:41.887
Oh, God. Tom, wait!
Wait a second, would ya?

15:42.624 --> 15:45.077
Dominate, Nick!
Dominate!

15:47.168 --> 15:50.374
Hello, Wilson. How's business?

15:51.332 --> 15:53.316
Yeah, I can't complain.

15:55.273 --> 15:58.077
So uh… When're ya
gonna sell me that car?

15:58.184 --> 16:00.707
Well I've still got my man
working on it.

16:00.848 --> 16:02.745
Yeah well he works pretty slow, don't he?

16:03.099 --> 16:05.276
Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else.

16:05.322 --> 16:07.560
Uh no, no no, I wasn't
saying that, I… was…

16:07.617 --> 16:10.506
If it's business, you should
be talking to me.

16:11.250 --> 16:14.448
Get some chairs, why don't you,
so somebody can sit down!

16:16.265 --> 16:19.565
Uh, sure.
Yeah, let's talk business.

16:20.585 --> 16:23.474
Sure. I'll get the chairs, uh…

16:23.506 --> 16:25.416
Mirt, why don't you uh…
don't you entertain.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.880
— Oh yeah.
— Yeah. I…

16:27.612 --> 16:29.735
— Hi.
— Hi.

16:30.108 --> 16:32.654
— Mr. Buchanan. Candy?
— Uh. No! Thank you.

16:32.727 --> 16:34.403
— No?
— Uh. Mrs. Wilson.

16:34.443 --> 16:35.650
— Okay.
— Nick Carraway.

16:35.677 --> 16:37.466
Oh. A pleasure.

16:37.589 --> 16:39.434
— Uh, Nick's a writer.
— Ah?

16:39.457 --> 16:41.565
Oh, I'm— I'm in bonds, actually.

16:41.588 --> 16:43.411
I want you…

16:44.066 --> 16:45.442
get on the next train.

16:45.486 --> 16:47.418
— Now?
— Yes!

16:47.857 --> 16:50.135
Can we get the dog for the apartment?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.183
Whatever you want.

16:51.233 --> 16:53.238
Hey, Mr. Buchanan, you want a—
you want a soda?

16:53.261 --> 16:56.113
— Uh! I'm fine!
— No? Ah.

16:56.402 --> 16:58.226
Call your sister,
she will like him.

16:58.254 --> 17:00.348
No no no. Uh. That's alright, thank you.

17:00.375 --> 17:03.187
Catherine's said to be very good looking,
by people who oughta know.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.411
Uh. Really I can't.

17:04.441 --> 17:07.156
Hey! You wanna embarrass Myrtle?

17:09.012 --> 17:11.445
That's rude.

17:48.935 --> 17:52.532
I'm Catherine.
Ain't we having a party?

17:53.052 --> 17:55.720
Hum… I'm not sure
now's a good time.

17:55.881 --> 17:58.541
I'm just going. Uh.
Actually, there are peop—

17:58.549 --> 18:01.154
Hullo! Oh Chester,
this must be the cousin.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.940
Oh, you are adorable!

18:02.994 --> 18:03.735
Oh, thank you.

18:03.748 --> 18:06.547
— Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you.
— Nick Carraway.

18:06.603 --> 18:08.674
— Come on, don't you like me?
— Oh! Uh! Plant!

18:09.322 --> 18:12.082
Myrtle? Myrtle?

18:16.187 --> 18:19.270
Myrtle Turtle!

18:19.568 --> 18:20.846
I really must go!

18:20.847 --> 18:23.402
Myrtle, get everybody a drink
before they fall asleep.

18:23.628 --> 18:25.580
Tom, I'm— I'm just leaving now.

18:25.581 --> 18:26.428
Nick! Wait!

18:26.429 --> 18:28.695
I'm just… I'm just going,
I've gotta get out of here.

18:28.719 --> 18:29.511
Nonsense!

18:29.519 --> 18:31.511
Go on in there, talk to Catherine!

18:31.558 --> 18:33.987
Tom, I'm not comfortable here.
Daisy is my cousin.

18:34.045 --> 18:36.089
Listen, I know you like to watch.

18:36.090 --> 18:37.688
I remember that from college.
— That's not what—

18:37.708 --> 18:39.343
Oh no no no, I don't make any judgment.

18:39.376 --> 18:43.698
We have all summer! Now you wanna
sit on the sideline and watch,

18:43.899 --> 18:45.493
or d'you wanna play ball?

18:45.553 --> 18:47.886
— Play ball!
— Ain't we good enough for you?

18:47.909 --> 18:50.649
Come on!
— Come on! Yeah!

18:51.641 --> 18:53.813
He's gonna sit on the side and watch? Uh?

18:53.839 --> 18:55.558
Or is he gonna play ball?

18:56.661 --> 18:58.841
Take off your hat and stay a while.

18:58.888 --> 18:59.863
Oh, uh Nick.

18:59.864 --> 19:02.648
McKee is in the artistic game.
— Photography.

19:02.680 --> 19:06.326
— Yeah. Nick's artistic.
— No! No no no, not really!

19:06.656 --> 19:09.062
I write a little, but…
— Really?

19:09.131 --> 19:12.045
Do you live on Long Island too?
— I live in West Egg.

19:12.103 --> 19:14.240
I was there at a party
about a month ago.

19:14.432 --> 19:18.035
A man named Gatsbys.
D'you know him?

19:18.089 --> 19:20.452
I live right next door to him.

19:20.502 --> 19:22.877
He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhem's.

19:23.058 --> 19:25.663
You know, the evil German king?
— Really?

19:25.671 --> 19:29.195
Hey McKee! Take a picture of that!

19:29.950 --> 19:32.088
Don't, I'm not one of those models!

19:32.244 --> 19:34.444
But you can, if you want.

19:37.250 --> 19:40.998
Neither of them can stand
the person they're married to.

19:41.206 --> 19:42.911
Doesn't she like Wilson either?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.705
He's a greasy little scumbag.

19:44.787 --> 19:48.247
No thanks. I feel just as good
on nothing at all.

19:48.494 --> 19:52.077
Nerve pills. I get them
from a doctor in Queens.

19:52.193 --> 19:53.299
Do you want one?

19:53.372 --> 19:56.472
Oh no. My nerves are fine, thanks.

20:05.965 --> 20:09.125
<i>I had been drunk just twice in my life.</i>

20:09.361 --> 20:13.683
<i>And the second time was that afternoon.</i>

20:56.368 --> 21:00.008
<i>That night in the hidden flat
that Tom kept for Myrtle,</i>

21:00.270 --> 21:03.969
<i>we were buoyed by a sort
of chemical madness.</i>

21:04.118 --> 21:08.691
<i>A willingness of the heart that
burst thunderously upon us all.</i>

21:09.191 --> 21:12.530
<i>And suddenly, I began to like New York.</i>

21:12.684 --> 21:14.929
This is better than the Yale club!

21:47.152 --> 21:49.631
<i>High over the city,</i>

21:49.759 --> 21:55.145
<i>our yellow windows must have contributed
their share of human secrets</i>

21:56.610 --> 21:59.252
<i>to the casual watcher in the street.</i>

22:02.341 --> 22:04.401
<i>And I was him too,</i>

22:04.440 --> 22:10.048
<i>looking up and wondering,
I was within… and without…</i>

22:13.533 --> 22:16.478
…enchanted and repelled…

22:17.195 --> 22:21.290
by the inexhaustible variety of life.

22:29.820 --> 22:32.381
You have got no right to speak her name!

22:32.382 --> 22:35.058
— Daisy, Daisy, Daisy—
— You got no right to speak her name!

22:35.166 --> 22:38.000
I'll speak her name when—

22:40.677 --> 22:42.631
Oh my God! You are crazy!

22:42.632 --> 22:43.960
You're a whore!

22:43.985 --> 22:45.987
They're gonna arrest you!

22:58.504 --> 23:00.689
I have no clue how I got home.

23:00.790 --> 23:05.904
<i>But I do know that I awoke
with a distinctly uneasy feeling</i>

23:05.987 --> 23:08.742
<i>that Gatsby was watching me.</i>

23:10.925 --> 23:12.982
Watching you?

23:13.877 --> 23:17.920
Yes. Gatsby was always watching me.

23:19.634 --> 23:21.792
And how did you know that?

23:21.966 --> 23:23.874
I got an invitation.

23:26.085 --> 23:27.911
I was the only one.

23:27.985 --> 23:30.904
<i>By which I mean, no one except me</i>

23:31.265 --> 23:35.606
<i>ever received an actual
invitation to Gatsby's.</i>

23:37.601 --> 23:41.611
<i>You see, the rest of New York
simply came uninvited.</i>

23:44.110 --> 23:49.418
<i>The whole city packed into automobiles
and all weekends, every weekend,</i>

23:49.794 --> 23:52.854
<i>ended up at Gatsby's.</i>

24:02.124 --> 24:07.510
<i>And I mean, everyone from every walk
of life and every corner of New York city.</i>

24:07.845 --> 24:13.709
<i>This kaleidoscopic carnival
spilled through Gatsby's door.</i>

24:13.917 --> 24:15.984
— Out of the way!
— My invitation.

24:17.217 --> 24:19.113
Hello.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.275
— Sir, my invitation.
— This way!

24:51.897 --> 24:57.000
<i>A caravansary of billionaire playboy
publishers and their blond nurses…</i>

24:57.591 --> 25:01.291
<i>Heiresses comparing inheritances
on Gatsby's beach.</i>

25:01.499 --> 25:05.359
<i>My boss, Walter Chase,
losing money at the roulette tables.</i>

25:05.687 --> 25:10.752
<i>Gossip columnists alongside gangsters
and governors exchanging telephone numbers.</i>

25:11.426 --> 25:14.694
<i>Film stars, Broadway Directors,</i>

25:14.725 --> 25:17.924
<i>morality protectors,
high school defectors,</i>

25:17.964 --> 25:22.362
<i>and Ewing Klipspringer,
dubious descendant of Beethoven.</i>

25:27.609 --> 25:31.550
Do you know where I might find the host,
Mr. Gatsby? I live just next door.

25:31.624 --> 25:34.483
Gatsby? I've never seen Mr. Gatsby, sir.

25:34.564 --> 25:36.606
Why, no one has.

25:37.075 --> 25:42.706
Alone and a little embarrassed,
I decided to get roaring drunk.

26:12.002 --> 26:14.455
I thought I might see you here.

26:16.508 --> 26:17.966
Hello!

26:18.090 --> 26:19.942
I remembered you live next door.

26:19.980 --> 26:21.382
It's like an amusement park!

26:21.776 --> 26:22.800
Shall we?

26:23.343 --> 26:26.833
— Did you get an invitation?
— People aren't invited to Gatsby's.

26:27.042 --> 26:29.945
Well I was. Seems I'm the only one.

26:30.153 --> 26:31.362
Who is this Gatsby?

26:31.363 --> 26:33.717
He was a German spy during the war.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.165
Teddy Barton, Nick Carraway.

26:36.166 --> 26:37.364
A German spy?

26:37.572 --> 26:39.904
No no, no no. He's the Kaizer's assassin.

26:39.943 --> 26:41.927
— I heard he killed a man once.
— It's true!

26:41.934 --> 26:43.858
— He kills for fun.
— Free of charge.

26:43.917 --> 26:45.784
He's certainly richer than God.

26:46.706 --> 26:49.198
You don't really believe
he killed a man, do you?

26:49.266 --> 26:51.510
Well, let's go find him, and
you can ask him yourself.

29:28.729 --> 29:30.440
Uh, yes, the ninth battalion.

29:30.463 --> 29:31.987
— I was in the seventh.
— Excuse me.

29:32.017 --> 29:34.109
I knew you looked familiar.
Having a good time, old sport?

29:34.149 --> 29:36.977
Oh, the whole thing's incredible.
I live just next door.

29:37.582 --> 29:41.046
Uh, he sent me an actual invitation.
Seems I'm the only one.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.427
I still haven't met Mr. Gatsby.

29:43.452 --> 29:44.372
No one's met him.

29:44.379 --> 29:47.757
They say he's third cousin to the Kaiser,
and second cousin to the devil.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.864
I'm afraid I haven't been
a very good host, old sport.

29:50.912 --> 29:52.914
You see…

29:55.196 --> 29:57.254
I'm Gatsby.

Sorry old sport, I though you knew.

Please, just… I don't know
what to say, please forgive me.

30:21.937 --> 30:24.535
— It's quite alright.
— I've had so much to drink.

30:24.583 --> 30:25.997
— Yes?
— Mr. Gatsby, Sir.

30:26.035 --> 30:27.653

30:32.688 --> 30:35.104
Would you like to go with me?

— What time?
— The time that suits you.

30:38.155 --> 30:40.168
Well, that's very kind of you.

30:41.043 --> 30:43.613
Lovely to see you again, Miss Baker.

30:44.513 --> 30:49.337
If there is anything that you want…
just ask for it, old sport.

30:52.828 --> 30:56.442
Excuse me.
I will rejoin you later.

31:01.831 --> 31:04.048
I expected him to be…

31:04.243 --> 31:06.363
— Old and fat?
— Yes.

31:06.818 --> 31:12.040
Young men don't just drift coolly out of
nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island.

31:13.874 --> 31:16.722
He told me once he was an Oxford man.

31:17.114 --> 31:18.912
However I don't believe it.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.041
— Why not?
— I don't know.

31:21.130 --> 31:23.168
I just don't believe he went there.

31:23.404 --> 31:24.843
I beg your pardon.

31:25.157 --> 31:29.631
Ms. Baker, Mr. Gatsby would
like to speak to you, alone.

31:30.298 --> 31:33.377
— With me?
— Yes, madam.

33:13.045 --> 33:16.185
Nick. Nick!
Nick!

33:17.228 --> 33:19.753
I've just heard the most shocking thing!

33:19.827 --> 33:21.706
Where have you been?
The car's waiting.

33:21.714 --> 33:23.699
— Come on, we're leaving.
— This is amazing.

33:23.885 --> 33:27.685
It all makes sense!
It all makes sense!

33:27.716 --> 33:29.484
Come on!

33:29.511 --> 33:31.769
— What makes sense?
— Everything.

33:31.786 --> 33:33.831
Come on, this is crazy.
We gotta get out of here.

33:33.847 --> 33:37.036
Oh, but here I am tantalizing you,
and I swore I wouldn't tell.

33:37.070 --> 33:38.211
Just tell me.

33:38.536 --> 33:42.217
Oh Nick, I'm sorry, I swore.
I swore I wouldn't tell.

33:49.023 --> 33:51.620
Sorry to keep her from you, old sport.

33:51.935 --> 33:55.975
Don't forget, we're going up in
that hydroplane tomorrow morning.

33:56.249 --> 33:57.208
Yes!

33:57.209 --> 33:59.621
Mr. Gatsby sir, Philadelphia on the phone.

33:59.662 --> 34:01.093
Yeah.

34:02.740 --> 34:05.867
Good night, old sport. Good night.

34:06.548 --> 34:08.648
Thank you.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.675
What's the matter?
You run out of gas?

34:16.587 --> 34:20.781
Nick! Come and see me!
We'll have tea next week!

34:20.800 --> 34:22.774
I'm in the phone book.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.998
I'll call you up.

34:55.141 --> 35:00.459
<i>Well, we rode in the hydroplane,
and I attended two more of his parties.</i>

35:00.748 --> 35:03.605
<i>Even made use of his beach.</i>

35:03.838 --> 35:05.425
<i>But you know, doctor,</i>

35:05.544 --> 35:11.800
<i>I realized that I knew absolutely
nothing about Gatsby at all.</i>

35:12.884 --> 35:14.838
<i>Until…</i>

35:36.164 --> 35:39.410
It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?
Haven't you ever seen it before?

35:39.795 --> 35:43.979
It's all a custom job.
Supercharged engine.

35:44.441 --> 35:47.525
Get dressed. We're going to lunch.

35:47.550 --> 35:49.552
— Oh, well.
— Yeah.

36:04.092 --> 36:08.547
Look here, old sport. What…
What is your opinion of me anyhow?

36:08.613 --> 36:11.732
— My opinion?
— Yes, yes. Your opinion.

36:12.609 --> 36:15.162
I don't want you to get the
wrong impression from all these—

36:15.230 --> 36:17.831
from all these bizarre accusations
you must be hearing.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.463
A pack of lies, I guarantee.
You— you've heard the stories.

36:20.489 --> 36:22.454
— Oh! Well—
— I will tell you God's truth.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.016
God's truth about myself.

36:24.089 --> 36:26.481
I am the son of very wealthy
people from the Middle West.

36:26.535 --> 36:29.056
Sadly, all of them are dead now.

36:30.786 --> 36:33.679
I was brought up in America, but
educated at Oxford because all my

36:33.691 --> 36:36.978
ancestors had been educated there for many
years, you see, it's a family tradition.

36:37.197 --> 36:41.252
<i>The way he spoke! No wonder
people thought he was lying.</i>

36:41.453 --> 36:44.651
After my family died, I came
into a great deal of money.

36:44.853 --> 36:48.005
After that, I lived like a young prince
in all the capitals of Europe.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.785
— Oh, Europe?
— Yes, Europe!

36:50.786 --> 36:54.204
Paris, Venice, Rome,
Vienna, Zurich,

36:54.412 --> 36:58.934
Helsinki, Moscow, Istanbul,
collecting jewels —chiefly rubies—

36:58.989 --> 37:02.346
hunting big game, painting a little—
things for myself only.

37:02.371 --> 37:04.101
Trying to forget something sad.

37:04.102 --> 37:07.661
<i>Just when I thought it couldn't be
any more fantastical…</i>

37:07.718 --> 37:09.407
Then came the war, old sport.

37:09.421 --> 37:13.869
<i>…he became a war hero,
single handedly defeating the German army.</i>

37:13.896 --> 37:17.375
In the Argonne forest, I took two
machine gun detachments, so far—

37:17.414 --> 37:20.413
outnumbered, five to one—
there was half a mile gap on either side—

37:20.447 --> 37:22.499
there wasn't a single
German soldier left standing—

37:22.533 --> 37:25.282
we stayed there two days and two nights—
and we saw piles of dead—

37:25.310 --> 37:28.369
130 men, with only 16 Lewis guns—

37:28.409 --> 37:31.675
every allied government gave
me a medal — even Montenegro.

37:34.062 --> 37:36.471
Here, that's from Montenegro.

37:36.759 --> 37:39.753
"Major Jay Gatsby,
for Valour Extraordinary".

37:39.982 --> 37:41.050
That's right.

37:41.277 --> 37:44.756
And this something I always carry with me,
a souvenir of Oxford days.

37:44.903 --> 37:49.113
That was taken in Trinity Quad, the man
on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.

37:49.182 --> 37:50.954
<i>What could I say?</i>

37:51.822 --> 37:54.561
<i>The photograph was undoubtedly authentic.</i>

37:54.748 --> 37:57.014
<i>Could it all be true?</i>

37:57.310 --> 37:59.932
But of course, you don't need
to take my word for it, old sport.

37:59.950 --> 38:01.832
At lunch today,
I'm going to introduce you

38:01.869 --> 38:03.996
to one of New York's most
distinguished businessmen,

38:04.010 --> 38:06.789
a Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim.
My good friend.

38:06.835 --> 38:10.042
And he will confirm all I have told you,
and vouch for my good character.

38:10.104 --> 38:11.708
Oh, I'm sure that's not necessary.

38:11.753 --> 38:13.330
Oh, but it is though.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.780
You see, I though you ought to
know something about my life,

38:15.821 --> 38:17.286
I didn't want you
to think I was…

38:17.628 --> 38:20.280
Well, I didn't want you to think
I was just some nobody.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.605
— No!
— You see, old sport, I'm…

38:22.645 --> 38:25.618
I'm going to make a very
big request of you today.

38:25.846 --> 38:27.022
A big request?

38:27.023 --> 38:31.135
Yes. Ms. Baker will explain everything
when you take her to tea this afternoon.

38:33.181 --> 38:35.620
Jordan? What's she got to do with it?

38:36.205 --> 38:38.236
Well I assure you it's nothing underhand.

38:38.260 --> 38:41.813
Miss Baker's a honest sportswoman, she
wouldn't do anything that wasn't alright.

38:42.271 --> 38:44.303
Pull over! Pull over to the curb!

38:44.365 --> 38:46.610
Alright old sport. Alright.

38:51.869 --> 38:54.908
Right you are! I'll know you
next time, Mr. Gatsby.

38:54.949 --> 38:57.375
— Excuse me!
— Thank you.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.872
— One of your old Oxford pals?
— Well I was…

39:01.940 --> 39:04.662
I was able to do the
commissioner a favor once.

39:04.692 --> 39:06.537
He sends me a Christmas card every year.

39:07.173 --> 39:10.483
I imagine he'll be at lunch too.

39:15.031 --> 39:18.886
<i>Βy the time we reached the bridge,
Ι was impossibly confused.</i>

39:30.811 --> 39:33.391
<i>I didn't know what to think.</i>

39:33.703 --> 39:36.429
<i>But the city seen from
the Queensboro Bridge</i>

39:36.432 --> 39:39.991
<i>is always the city seen
for the first time…</i>

39:40.723 --> 39:47.044
<i>In its first wild promise of all
the mystery and the beauty in the world.</i>

39:48.375 --> 39:50.673
<i>Anything can happen!</i>

39:50.727 --> 39:53.568
<i>Now that we've slid over
this bridge, I though…</i>

39:53.738 --> 39:58.666
<i>Anything at all, even Gatsby,
could happen.</i>

40:00.591 --> 40:02.593
<i>Yes, absolutely.
Have you heard about…</i>

40:05.591 --> 40:08.264
Aah! My boy!

40:08.889 --> 40:10.891
Meyer, Meyer, Meyer.

40:11.246 --> 40:13.651
— Smell so good. Look at you!
— Look at you!

40:13.698 --> 40:16.058
Mr. Carraway, this is my good friend,
Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim.

40:16.687 --> 40:18.846
A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway.

40:18.940 --> 40:21.091
— My pleasure.
— I know all about you.

40:21.116 --> 40:22.488
— I see.
— Yes!

40:22.528 --> 40:25.522
Mr. Gatsby's always talking about you.
— Really?

40:26.572 --> 40:27.963
Shall we?

40:28.139 --> 40:29.629
Come!

40:30.808 --> 40:34.152
Join us for a little lunch.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.879
♪<i>Hundred, hundred, hundred dollar bills</i>

40:57.905 --> 40:58.479
Yeah!

40:58.505 --> 41:00.755
— …hands off! Get your hands off me!
— Out! Out you go!

41:01.712 --> 41:05.850
Tell Walter Chase. He keeps his mouth
shut or he doesn't get a penny.

41:06.058 --> 41:07.685
We'll talk about that later.

41:07.686 --> 41:10.412
— Highballs, Mr. Gatsby?
— Highballs it is.

41:10.471 --> 41:12.002
— Alright!
— Take care of my friend.

41:12.327 --> 41:13.826
Mr. Warden. May I ask you…

41:13.827 --> 41:15.927
Look who's here!

41:15.954 --> 41:18.649
You see these fists?
He's the next heavyweight champion.

41:18.686 --> 41:20.474
Pay my respects to your boss.

41:20.531 --> 41:23.554
Hey, Jay! You're under arrest!

41:23.555 --> 41:27.180
You be careful now, you're turning into
a real jazz hound, commissioner!

41:31.151 --> 41:33.021
That's the commissioner back there.

41:33.043 --> 41:35.145
Mr. Gatsby! You table is ready.

41:35.273 --> 41:37.275
Gatsby!
Good to see you!

41:39.741 --> 41:42.319
You be careful with those
tables now, Senator.

41:42.342 --> 41:44.111
I'll put a bet on for you, Jay!

41:50.172 --> 41:53.432
We'll have the lobster. It's decorated
with truffles and fine herbs.

42:04.250 --> 42:07.364
How's the bond business, Mr. Carraway?

42:07.505 --> 42:08.399
Fine, thank you.

42:08.467 --> 42:11.466
I understand you're looking
for a business connection.

42:11.517 --> 42:15.130
No. No no, no. No no no.
Uh. This isn't the man, Meyer.

42:15.239 --> 42:18.225
Remember this is the friend
I told you about.

42:18.270 --> 42:21.813
Oh my, I beg your pardon.
I had the wrong man.

42:23.328 --> 42:26.866
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to make that call.

42:30.510 --> 42:32.683
— Any luck, Senator ?
— What a gentleman.

42:32.714 --> 42:35.748
From one of the finest
families in the Midwest.

42:36.103 --> 42:38.161
Sadly, all dead now.

42:38.303 --> 42:42.678
When I first made the pleasure of Mr.
Gatsby's acquaintance just after the war,

42:43.385 --> 42:47.094
I knew I'd discovered
a man of fine breeding.

42:47.176 --> 42:54.033
A war hero, such medals, and…
a man, an Oxford man.

42:54.816 --> 42:57.937
You know Oxford?
— Yes, I've heard of it.

42:58.034 --> 43:00.236
Then you would know that when
it comes to married women,

43:00.237 --> 43:01.847
a man like this can be trusted.

43:03.191 --> 43:09.293
With a friend, with someone like you,
he'd never so much as look at your wife.

43:10.673 --> 43:14.720
— I'm not married.
— But you work on Wall Street, right?

43:14.749 --> 43:15.573
Yes.

43:18.491 --> 43:23.171
You're looking at my tie pin?
Finest specimen of human molar.

43:23.239 --> 43:24.385
Gentlemen?

43:25.400 --> 43:26.664
Everything alright?

43:26.719 --> 43:31.553
Yes! Yes, we… we were just
talking about other people's wives.

43:31.669 --> 43:33.501
— Other people's wives?
— Yes.

43:33.602 --> 43:35.389
Well, my work here is done.

43:35.558 --> 43:40.072
I'm gonna leave you gentlemen
to talk about your sports and your women.

43:40.135 --> 43:42.938
— Other people's wives?
— Hello, ladies.

43:45.677 --> 43:47.877
Who is he anyhow ? An actor?

43:47.878 --> 43:51.116
Meyer? No no no.
He's a gambler.

43:53.786 --> 43:56.581
He's the man who fixed
the 1919 World's Series.

43:57.007 --> 43:58.991
— Fixed it?
— Fixed it.

43:59.218 --> 44:01.232
How did he manage that?

44:01.571 --> 44:04.287
He saw the opportunity, I suppose.

44:04.495 --> 44:06.989
He's a very smart man.

44:15.705 --> 44:18.358
Now old sport, about Miss Baker
and that—

44:18.417 --> 44:20.836
that request we spoke of—
— Nick?

44:21.270 --> 44:24.189
Nick!
— Tom! Funny seeing you!

44:24.250 --> 44:26.648
— How have you been?
— Yeah! Good.

44:26.703 --> 44:29.804
Nick, Daisy is furious.
You haven't called her.

44:29.918 --> 44:33.557
Hey, uh. Mr. Gatsby, this is Mr. Buchanan.

44:35.383 --> 44:37.474
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

44:39.810 --> 44:42.917
I never wouldn't have expected
to find you in this temple of virtue.

44:42.931 --> 44:45.204
Well, I was just having
lunch with Mr. Gatsby.

44:53.836 --> 44:54.810
Can I help you, sir?

44:54.868 --> 44:57.520
Jordan Baker, the famous
sporting star? The golfer?

44:57.921 --> 45:00.143
I— I see, I've spotted her. Thank you.

45:00.144 --> 45:01.092
There you are.

45:01.118 --> 45:03.047
What kind of game are you
and Gatsby playing at?

45:03.075 --> 45:04.765
— This gentleman will be joining—
— Excuse me, one moment.

45:04.795 --> 45:06.274
— Nick, please, just sit down.
— Well, it's all rather strange,

45:06.294 --> 45:07.785
he picks me up in his fancy yellow car,

45:07.811 --> 45:09.469
and he's going on and on about his life,
— Please keep your voice down,

45:09.502 --> 45:11.125
— and the war and…
— Everybody can hear you.

45:11.139 --> 45:15.630
— What is this enormous request, Jordan—
— He wants you to invite Daisy to tea.

45:16.947 --> 45:19.016
Daisy?

45:19.831 --> 45:23.077
And Gatsby.
Why?

45:23.769 --> 45:26.315
I don't quite know where to start.

45:26.428 --> 45:31.354
You see, I didn't realize until
the other night that I'd met Gatsby.

45:31.536 --> 45:34.483
Five years ago. In Louisville.

45:35.517 --> 45:38.476
That was the day I got
my new English golf shoes.

45:42.269 --> 45:46.840
Daisy was by far the most popular girl
with the officers from Camp Taylor.

45:47.324 --> 45:48.410
Hello, Jordan.

45:49.044 --> 45:53.598
One of them was in the car with her.
It was Gatsby.

45:53.806 --> 45:58.140
And the way he looked at her, is
the way all girls want to be looked at.

45:58.529 --> 46:00.731
So. Tell me what happened.

46:01.119 --> 46:02.474
Well, I don't know.

46:02.785 --> 46:04.441
Charge!

46:06.921 --> 46:09.132
Gatsby was sent off to war.

46:09.372 --> 46:12.596
When the war ended,
Daisy waited,

46:12.933 --> 46:17.053
but for some unknown reason,
Gatsby couldn't return.

46:17.337 --> 46:22.803
A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago
swept in and stole her away.

46:22.893 --> 46:27.722
He gave her a string of pearls
worth 350,000 dollars.

46:28.493 --> 46:31.359
But the morning of the wedding,
Daisy received a letter.

46:31.373 --> 46:33.745
Tell them Daisy's changed her mind!

46:33.798 --> 46:35.606
— What is this?
— Daisy, please!

46:35.665 --> 46:37.985
— Hand it to me!
— No!

46:38.098 --> 46:39.800
Leave me alone!

46:39.837 --> 46:41.213
Jordan, no one must know about this.

46:41.214 --> 46:45.201
— But what was in the letter?
— I don't know, she wouldn't tell me.

46:45.777 --> 46:47.263
But it was too late.

46:47.394 --> 46:51.644
That day at five o'clock,
Daisy Fay married Tom Buchanan

46:51.732 --> 46:55.779
with more pomp and circumstance
Louisville had ever seen.

46:56.304 --> 46:58.304
Congratulations, Mr. Buchanan!

47:00.540 --> 47:03.853
After the honeymoon,
I saw them in Santa Barbara.

47:04.026 --> 47:07.667
Well it was touching, really, I'd never
seen a girl so in love with her husband.

47:08.107 --> 47:10.759
A week later, Tom crashed his car.

47:10.820 --> 47:13.938
The girl with him was a chambermaid
at the Santa Barbara hotel.

47:13.980 --> 47:15.784
It got into all the papers.

47:16.999 --> 47:19.667
— It's a strange coincidence.
— What is?

47:19.728 --> 47:22.975
The fact that Gatsby's house
is just across the bay.

47:23.569 --> 47:28.121
It's no coincidence. He bought
that house to be near her.

47:28.512 --> 47:31.863
He threw all those parties,
hoping she would wander in one night.

47:31.937 --> 47:36.092
He constantly asked about Daisy.
I was just the first person that knew her.

47:37.191 --> 47:40.244
All that for a girl
he hasn't seen in five years.

47:40.309 --> 47:42.981
And now he just wants me
to invite her over to tea.

47:43.656 --> 47:45.845
The modesty of it…

47:46.261 --> 47:48.099
kind of take your breath
away, doesn't it?

47:48.122 --> 47:50.908
Evening, sweet hearts.
Where're you kids going?

47:51.006 --> 47:52.798
— Long Island, please.
— Long Island.

47:52.851 --> 47:55.981
And you think I should?
I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby?

47:56.111 --> 47:58.002
She's absolutely not to know.

47:58.328 --> 48:01.891
You're just supposed to invite her over,
so he can happen to pass by.

48:02.605 --> 48:05.124
<i>I remember feeling torn.</i>

48:05.445 --> 48:09.210
<i>Was it right to bring my cousin
Daisy, a married woman,</i>

48:09.319 --> 48:12.652
<i>together with a man I hardly knew?</i>

48:17.426 --> 48:21.563
<i>When I returned home,
Gatsby's was lit from tower to cellar</i>

48:21.593 --> 48:25.013
<i>as if for another wild party.</i>

48:28.052 --> 48:30.491
<i>But there wasn't a sound.</i>

48:44.866 --> 48:47.171
— Thank you.
 — Have a good night, sir.

48:56.052 --> 49:00.138
Your place looks like
the World's fair or Coney Island.

49:00.299 --> 49:02.250
— Ah, does it?
— Yes.

49:02.325 --> 49:05.948
Oh I— I've just been… glancing
into some of the rooms.

49:06.348 --> 49:08.586
What'd you say we go
to Coney Island, old sport?

49:08.640 --> 49:12.287
We— we could take my car if you want.
— Oh, uh… It's too late, tonight.

49:12.325 --> 49:14.074
We could take a plunge
in the swimming pool,

49:14.114 --> 49:16.682
I haven't made use of it all summer.
— I must go to bed.

49:17.546 --> 49:19.170
Alright.

49:26.672 --> 49:28.230
Happy to do it.

49:29.078 --> 49:32.277
I'm going to call Daisy
and invite her to tea.

49:32.284 --> 49:33.301
That's alright, I— I— I—

49:33.302 --> 49:35.552
— What day would suit you?
— What day would suit you!?

49:35.574 --> 49:37.149
I don't want to put you to any trouble.

49:37.212 --> 49:38.984
The day after tomorrow alright?

49:39.266 --> 49:41.299
The day after tomorrow?!

49:41.879 --> 49:46.180
Well I… See, I— I'd want
to get the grass cut.

49:47.905 --> 49:51.005
— Well…
— Uh…

49:52.054 --> 49:55.777
Look here old sport, you—
you don't make much money, do you?

49:55.825 --> 49:58.139
— Not really.
— If you forgive me.

49:58.711 --> 50:02.478
You see… I happen to run a little—
a little business on the side,

50:02.498 --> 50:05.268
a sort of side line. I mean,
you understand what I'm saying, right?

50:05.637 --> 50:08.569
You do sell bond, don't you, old sport?
— I'm trying to.

50:08.622 --> 50:11.834
Right, well, it happens to be a
rather confidential sort of thing,

50:11.861 --> 50:14.007
but you might make a nice
bit of money on the side.

50:14.033 --> 50:15.649
Uh no, thank you,
I have my hands full.

50:15.692 --> 50:18.499
But you wouldn't have to do any
business with Wolfsheim, I assure you.

50:18.536 --> 50:20.388
It's a favor, Jay, just a favor.

50:22.988 --> 50:25.565
Yes. I'm happy to do it.

50:25.971 --> 50:28.352
— A favor?
— Yes!

50:32.831 --> 50:35.373
— Well, good night.
— Good night.

51:23.639 --> 51:27.643
One of the papers says they thought
the rain would stop about 4:00.

51:28.200 --> 51:31.443
I think it was the—
I think it was the 'Journal'.

51:34.292 --> 51:35.776
Just in to the right, gentlemen.

51:35.803 --> 51:38.701
To the right, in the living room.
Thank you.

51:43.083 --> 51:45.011
Is everything alright?

51:45.229 --> 51:47.904
Oh, the grass looks fine,
if that's what you mean.

51:48.182 --> 51:50.923
Grass? What grass?

51:54.503 --> 51:56.313
I bought cakes.

52:07.799 --> 52:10.169
Have you— have you got
everything you need?

52:10.184 --> 52:11.717
Perhaps more flowers.

52:12.845 --> 52:16.415
— I think they did a fine job, don't you?
— Beautiful.

52:16.651 --> 52:18.421
You think it's too much?

52:19.656 --> 52:22.087
I think it's what you want.

52:22.140 --> 52:24.384
I think so too.

52:46.082 --> 52:47.705
I can't wait all day.

52:47.706 --> 52:49.328
I'm leaving!

52:49.615 --> 52:51.607
Ah, don't be silly,
it's just two minutes to four.

52:51.651 --> 52:53.215
No one's coming to tea, it's too—

53:01.792 --> 53:03.966
It's her!

53:17.533 --> 53:20.084
Is this absolutely where you live,
my dearest one?

53:20.118 --> 53:21.737
Yes, it suits me.

53:22.451 --> 53:25.844
Why did I have to come alone?
Are you in love with me?

53:25.985 --> 53:29.890
Oh, it's the secret of Carraway castle.
Tell your chauffeur to go far away.

53:30.332 --> 53:33.892
Come back in an hour, Ferdie.
His name is Ferdie.

53:47.433 --> 53:51.509
Oh my goodness!
I can't believe it.

53:53.336 --> 53:57.371
You? Did you ransack a greenhouse?

53:58.092 --> 54:00.623
He IS in love with me.

54:14.178 --> 54:15.391
Would you?

54:15.939 --> 54:18.727
— That's funny.
— What's funny?

54:27.532 --> 54:29.321
What are you doing?

55:19.687 --> 55:22.512
I'm certainly glad to see you again.

55:24.653 --> 55:30.222
Hi. I'm certainly glad
to see you as well.

55:58.547 --> 56:00.690
We've… we've uh…

56:01.424 --> 56:03.858
We've met before.

56:06.459 --> 56:10.001
I'll have someone to come
repair this immediately.

56:26.213 --> 56:28.432
Sorry about the clock.

56:28.753 --> 56:30.087
That's an old clock.

56:30.133 --> 56:32.598
— Lovely though, a lovely clock.
— Yes.

56:34.523 --> 56:38.503
— We haven't met for many years.
— Five years, next November.

56:40.858 --> 56:42.186
— Tea?
— Yes, thank you,

56:42.187 --> 56:43.991
— Darling, thank you.
— Thank you, old sport.

56:44.031 --> 56:45.664
— Lemon or sugar?
— Neither.

56:45.711 --> 56:47.133
Plain, thank you.

57:06.206 --> 57:08.336
— I just have to pop into town.
— Town?

57:08.357 --> 57:10.241
— I'll be right back.
— Nick, I've…

57:10.243 --> 57:13.321
got to speak to you about something!
— Yes, I— I'll be right back!

57:13.729 --> 57:17.176
God! This is a mistake!
This is a terrible, terrible mistake!

57:17.215 --> 57:19.821
You're just embarrassed,
Daisy's embarrassed too.

57:21.576 --> 57:24.889
— She is embarrassed?
— Yes. Just as much as you are.

57:24.914 --> 57:26.555
Don't talk so loud!

57:26.556 --> 57:27.977
You're acting like a little boy!

57:27.978 --> 57:30.510
You're being rude, Daisy's
in there all alone, and you—

58:06.497 --> 58:08.876
<i>Looking over my story so far,</i>

58:08.968 --> 58:12.878
<i>I'm reminded that, for the
second time that summer,</i>

58:13.486 --> 58:16.418
<i>I was guarding other people's secrets.</i>

58:17.773 --> 58:22.793
<i>Once again, I was within… and without.</i>

58:51.534 --> 58:53.704
It stopped raining.

58:56.764 --> 58:59.669
Yes. It has, hasn't it?

59:12.168 --> 59:14.272
What do you think of that, Daisy?

59:16.173 --> 59:20.182
Come look.
— Oh Nicky, how funny.

59:21.457 --> 59:24.021
Look, it's my house.

59:26.650 --> 59:29.411
Just there, across the bay.

59:34.922 --> 59:37.322
I know.

59:37.980 --> 59:40.818
I have the same view from my place.

59:42.014 --> 59:44.340
Where is your place?

59:46.761 --> 59:50.613
Nick, I want you and Daisy
both to come over to my house.

59:50.733 --> 59:52.203
I'd like to show her around.

59:52.438 --> 59:54.239
You sure you want me to come?

59:54.447 --> 59:58.229
Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely.

59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.966
Ladner, open the gates.
— Open the gates!

01:00:03.007 --> 01:00:06.181
I had the gates brought in
from a castle in Normandy.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.823
— Oh Jay, it's so grand!
— You like it?

01:00:12.996 --> 01:00:14.407
I love it.

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:17.997
— But how do you live here all alone?
— Well I don't.

01:00:18.312 --> 01:00:22.399
I keep it always full of
interesting celebrated people.

01:00:23.564 --> 01:00:25.735
Come with me.

01:00:30.174 --> 01:00:31.516
The house looks well, doesn't it?

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:34.039
See the way the whole front
catches the light like that?!

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:36.178
That's splendid.

01:00:39.128 --> 01:00:41.610
Come on, you two.
I want the Royal Tour!

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:44.089
You must understand that I like
all things that are modern!

01:00:44.137 --> 01:00:46.702
Press the orange, it all comes out there.

01:00:56.313 --> 01:00:57.770
Anyone for a round of golf?

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.086
You still know I'm a
champion golfer, don't you?

01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:01.267
— Great!
— Go on.

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:03.592
I thought we could…

01:01:03.617 --> 01:01:05.611
This remarkable little camera's
the latest design.

01:01:05.612 --> 01:01:07.398
Let me show you,
I'll show you how it's done.

01:01:07.423 --> 01:01:08.747
— Alright.
— Nick, keep filming.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:11.371
She's gonna take a swing.
— Get ready. Aim. Fore!

01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:15.289
I'm such a brute.

01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:17.965
— Okay, you're ready for your close-up?
— I don't want to forget a single moment.

01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:18.700
You're shimmering.

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:20.796
She look like she could be on
the cover of Vogue, don't you think?

01:01:20.807 --> 01:01:21.748
Turn on the camera!

01:01:24.873 --> 01:01:26.873
— Where did you go?
— Slow down.

01:01:26.898 --> 01:01:28.898
Slow down.

01:01:34.234 --> 01:01:36.965
— It's beautiful!
— It's a custom Wurlitzer.

01:01:37.046 --> 01:01:39.398
— Can anyone play that?
— Klipspringer can.

01:01:39.657 --> 01:01:41.595
— Someone, wake Ewing!
— Of course, sir.

01:01:41.623 --> 01:01:44.145
Music! And then we can dance all night.

01:01:44.175 --> 01:01:46.342
Ewing ​​is a funny genius,
he can play anything.

01:01:46.567 --> 01:01:47.989
Then I demand a Charleston.

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.939
She makes it look so— so splendid,
don't you think, old sport?

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.992
I have a man in England
who buys me clothes.

01:01:56.053 --> 01:01:58.105
I've never seen anything like this.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.542
Something for the lady.

01:02:00.225 --> 01:02:03.385
He sends over a selection
at the beginning of each season.

01:02:04.319 --> 01:02:06.123
These are silk.

01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:08.744
— These are flannel.
— They're so beautiful!

01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:10.538
— Indian cotton.
— Stop it, Jay!

01:02:12.298 --> 01:02:13.248
Linen!

01:02:14.183 --> 01:02:17.292
— Nicky, he's a mad man!
— I can't help you!

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.112
You know you'll have to refold
every single one of them!

01:02:21.186 --> 01:02:22.155
You'll ruin them!

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:27.867
Jay, stop it!

01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:29.903
— Right here!
— No, Jay!

01:02:47.002 --> 01:02:48.977
What is it?

01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:53.771
Daisy, Daisy darling, what is it?

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.457
It makes me sad.

01:03:02.427 --> 01:03:05.243
— Why?
— Because…

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:13.398
<i>Five lost years struggled on Daisy's lips.</i>

01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:18.074
<i>But all she could manage was…</i>

01:03:20.899 --> 01:03:22.899
Why?

01:03:24.038 --> 01:03:27.371
Cause I've never seen
such beautiful shirts before.

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:54.115
If it wasn't for the mist,
we could see the green light.

01:03:59.472 --> 01:04:01.276
What green light?

01:04:02.503 --> 01:04:06.648
The one that burns all night
at the end of your dock.

01:04:09.202 --> 01:04:14.718
<i>Possibly it had occurred to Gatsby that
the colossal significance of that light</i>

01:04:14.748 --> 01:04:17.848
<i>had vanished forever.</i>

01:04:17.962 --> 01:04:21.420
<i>Now it was once again
just a green light on a dock,</i>

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:26.229
<i>and his count of enchanted
object had diminished by one.</i>

01:04:27.677 --> 01:04:29.399
Who is this? Your father?

01:04:29.429 --> 01:04:32.254
Oh No. That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.

01:04:33.239 --> 01:04:34.657
He's dead now.

01:04:34.698 --> 01:04:37.687
He used to be my best friend
many years ago.

01:04:38.213 --> 01:04:41.410
You never told me you had
a pompadour or a yacht.

01:04:41.466 --> 01:04:43.673
I wanna show you something.

01:04:44.961 --> 01:04:46.900
Have a seat.

01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:51.359
Here's a lot of clippings I collect.
About you.

01:04:55.117 --> 01:04:58.011
You saved my letters.

01:04:58.386 --> 01:05:02.111
This was my first photo of you.

01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:05.768
You remember this letter, do you?
"We can't lose each other.

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:08.987
And let all this glorious
love end in nothing.

01:05:09.075 --> 01:05:12.510
Come home.
I'll be here waiting and hoping,

01:05:13.012 --> 01:05:16.274
for every long dream of you to come true."

01:05:20.013 --> 01:05:21.822
Excuse me.
- Sir, Slagle's in Detroit.

01:05:30.222 --> 01:05:32.549
I can't talk now, old sport.

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:39.930
He must know what a small town it is.
Listen to me! Listen to me!

01:05:43.817 --> 01:05:46.079
I said a small town.

01:05:46.704 --> 01:05:48.704
He must know what a small town is.

01:05:52.188 --> 01:05:56.366
Listen to me. He is of no use to us
if Detroit is his idea of ​​a small town,

01:05:56.379 --> 01:05:57.836
you understand?

01:06:03.556 --> 01:06:05.754
We'll chat later, old sport.

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:08.417
Alright.

01:06:11.693 --> 01:06:14.015
Klipspringer.

01:06:14.602 --> 01:06:16.665
He must be awake.

01:06:19.027 --> 01:06:20.880
Shall we?

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:15.227
I wish I had done everything
on earth with you.

01:07:21.978 --> 01:07:24.229
All my life…

01:07:26.424 --> 01:07:30.110
I wish it could always be like this.

01:07:36.396 --> 01:07:38.827
It will be.

01:07:42.189 --> 01:07:44.889
<i>If only it had been enough for Gatsby,</i>

01:07:44.957 --> 01:07:47.313
<i>just to hold Daisy.</i>

01:07:47.742 --> 01:07:52.550
<i>But he had a grand vision
for his life and Daisy's part in it.</i>

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:59.569
<i>It wasn't until the end of that summer,
on the last night I saw Gatsby,</i>

01:08:00.365 --> 01:08:05.159
<i>that he told me of the life he had
dreamed for himself since he was a boy.</i>

01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:10.174
You see, Doctor, Gatsby's real name was…

01:08:12.047 --> 01:08:13.764
James Gatz.

01:08:14.801 --> 01:08:19.447
<i>His parents were dirt-poor
farmers from North Dakota.</i>

01:08:20.023 --> 01:08:23.194
<i>He never accepted them
as his parents at all.</i>

01:08:23.907 --> 01:08:27.685
<i>In his own imagination,
he was a son of God.</i>

01:08:29.276 --> 01:08:32.140
<i>Destined for future glory.</i>

01:08:32.863 --> 01:08:38.377
<i>Chasing this destiny,
a 16-year-old Gatz ran far, far away.</i>

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:43.714
<i>One afternoon, off the coast of Lake
Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril.</i>

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:49.514
<i>He rode out and rescued the vessel and its
captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody.</i>

01:08:52.702 --> 01:08:55.660
You're gonna hit the shoal! Come on
sir, we're gonna hit the shoal!

01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:59.774
What the hell are you doing, old sport?

01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:03.251
<i>This was his opportunity,
and he seized it.</i>

01:09:03.295 --> 01:09:07.041
And I decided right then and there,
to call myself Jay Gatsby.

01:09:07.102 --> 01:09:11.191
<i>He sailed the yacht out of danger
and into his future.</i>

01:09:11.298 --> 01:09:17.063
<i>Gatsby showed skill and ambition,
and for five years, they sailed the world.</i>

01:09:17.725 --> 01:09:20.613
He was alright, old Dane.
He taught me everything.

01:09:20.803 --> 01:09:23.683
— <i>How to dress, act and speak…</i>
— Gatsby.

01:09:23.977 --> 01:09:25.745
— <i>…like a gentleman</i>
— Jay Gatsby.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.040
She looks well, don't she!

01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:29.960
<i>Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody's fortune.</i>
— Old sport.

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:35.167
<i>But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated
of his inheritance by Cody's family.</i>

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:38.765
He'd been left with the ability
to play the gentleman,

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:42.376
but he was once again dirt poor.

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:50.531
<i>By mid-summer, Gatsby was front page news.</i>

01:10:01.425 --> 01:10:04.270
<i>Where did the money come from?</i>

01:10:17.382 --> 01:10:20.258
<i>That's what the whole of
New York wanted to know.</i>

01:10:20.359 --> 01:10:23.696
<i>And it was the same
question on Tom's mind,</i>

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:28.166
<i>when he accompanied Daisy
to one of Gatsby's…</i>

01:10:28.246 --> 01:10:30.007
<i>…glittering parties.</i>
Take a look around.

01:10:30.774 --> 01:10:32.085
I'll be right back.

01:10:32.867 --> 01:10:36.358
You know, a lot of these newly rich people
are just filthy booze makers.

01:10:36.641 --> 01:10:40.541
Not Gatsby. He's a businessman,
he owned a lot of drugstores.

01:10:40.797 --> 01:10:42.982
— Businessman!
— May I introduce Senator Gulick.

01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:45.680
This is Mr. Carraway.
— Senator.

01:10:46.462 --> 01:10:48.099
Mrs. Buchanan.

01:10:48.188 --> 01:10:50.268
— Charmed.
— Delighted.

01:10:50.574 --> 01:10:53.594
Oh and Mr. Buchanan,
the polo player.

01:10:55.957 --> 01:10:56.771
No, not me.

01:10:56.798 --> 01:10:58.903
Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan.

01:10:58.943 --> 01:10:59.650
Likewise.

01:10:59.677 --> 01:11:02.089
Senator, I'll catch you up later,
perhaps at the crap table.

01:11:02.099 --> 01:11:03.917
I'd rather not be the polo player.

01:11:03.996 --> 01:11:07.145
Tom, you should be proud
of your achievements.

01:11:09.379 --> 01:11:12.624
— May I show you around?
— Sure.

01:11:14.597 --> 01:11:17.349
You must know the faces of
many people you've heard of.

01:11:17.381 --> 01:11:18.179
Absolutely.

01:11:18.206 --> 01:11:22.143
We don't go around very much. I don't
think I recognize a single person.

01:11:22.165 --> 01:11:25.138
Is that so? Perhaps you know
that lady right there.

01:11:25.184 --> 01:11:28.311
It's Marlene Moon!
I adore her pictures.

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.860
Would you like me to introduce you?

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:35.077
I'd really rather not be the Polo player.

01:11:41.522 --> 01:11:43.961
All these things excite me so.

01:11:44.698 --> 01:11:46.842
Nice little dance.

01:11:49.546 --> 01:11:53.726
I believe we've met before, Mr. Buchanan.
About a month ago.

01:11:56.352 --> 01:11:58.200
That's right!

01:11:58.458 --> 01:12:01.386
And you were with Nick, here.
The barber shop.

01:12:02.306 --> 01:12:05.925
That's right.
You see, I know your wife.

01:12:08.807 --> 01:12:11.610
— Is that so?
— Yes.

01:12:15.966 --> 01:12:19.685
Mr. Gatsby, sir.
Mr. Slagle is here.

01:12:19.686 --> 01:12:22.165
No, not now!
— … and guitars with…

01:12:22.941 --> 01:12:25.851
…the Foxtrot.

01:12:39.285 --> 01:12:43.906
Mr. Buchanan.
Would you mind terribly?

01:12:46.869 --> 01:12:48.635
Of course not.

01:12:51.725 --> 01:12:54.699
I think I can keep myself amused.

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:58.568
In case you need to
take down any addresses.

01:13:11.593 --> 01:13:14.095
Please move aside. Excuse me.

01:13:17.544 --> 01:13:19.404
Another swell party, Jay.

01:13:19.405 --> 01:13:22.289
Be careful for the snake charmer,
Mr. McLennahan.

01:13:22.878 --> 01:13:26.320
Is all this made entirely
from your own imagination?

01:13:27.453 --> 01:13:29.095
No.

01:13:30.146 --> 01:13:32.941
See, you were there all along.

01:13:33.149 --> 01:13:35.448
In every idea.

01:13:35.656 --> 01:13:37.568
Every decision.

01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:41.918
Of course, if anything is not
your liking, I'll change it.

01:13:45.002 --> 01:13:47.375
It's perfect.

01:13:47.488 --> 01:13:51.013
From your perfect
irresistible imagination.

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:58.638
I wonder where the devil he met her.

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:10.288
— I'll find you.
— Alright.

01:14:14.834 --> 01:14:16.711
Come with me.

01:14:19.036 --> 01:14:21.036
Coming through, please.
Pardon me.

01:14:24.261 --> 01:14:25.958
Thank you.

01:15:48.419 --> 01:15:50.470
Have you seen my wife?

01:15:52.412 --> 01:15:54.206
No.

01:15:54.547 --> 01:15:57.043
Not for a while.

01:15:59.306 --> 01:16:03.335
Whiskey. It's funny, the Senator
just saw her down here.

01:16:08.241 --> 01:16:10.934
I wish we could just run away.

01:16:19.906 --> 01:16:22.739
Run away?
No.

01:16:23.265 --> 01:16:27.358
Daisy, darling, that…
that wouldn't be respectable.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.756
You live around here, Nick?

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.159
— Just next door.
— Is that so?

01:16:39.121 --> 01:16:45.812
We're gonna live here.
In this house. You and me.

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:50.975
Darling…

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.626
It's time to tell Tom.

01:16:58.051 --> 01:17:00.051
Come on boys, it's too late!

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.759
Good night, gentlemen!

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.462
What a circus.

01:17:08.486 --> 01:17:14.209
Well, if you see her, I'll be
looking for her. You tell her.

01:17:16.107 --> 01:17:17.907
Remember how much fun we had?

01:17:17.947 --> 01:17:20.614
I don't know why we can't
just have fun like that again.

01:17:20.655 --> 01:17:22.482
Hello?

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:27.864
Hello, Nicky. We're having a row.

01:17:27.865 --> 01:17:30.917
— What about?
— About things.

01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:34.648
About the future.

01:17:35.804 --> 01:17:38.124
The future of the Colored Empires.

01:17:39.597 --> 01:17:42.665
It's Tom, he's wandering
around the party,

01:17:42.787 --> 01:17:43.785
 looking for—
— Sir.

01:17:44.521 --> 01:17:49.175
Mr. Gatsby, sir. It's Mr. Slagle.
He's quite emotional.

01:17:50.619 --> 01:17:52.286
Excuse me.

01:17:55.732 --> 01:17:58.695
Nick. Would you mind terribly?

01:17:58.783 --> 01:18:00.843
Of course.

01:18:03.557 --> 01:18:07.706
<i>Gatsby disappeared to deal
with a dispute of some sort.</i>

01:18:09.662 --> 01:18:11.888
<i>Daisy waited.</i>

01:18:15.137 --> 01:18:18.656
<i>But Gatsby was unable to return.</i>

01:18:20.756 --> 01:18:23.848
With these hot-headed types
in here, I rely on you.

01:18:24.174 --> 01:18:25.600
But you were not available.

01:18:26.038 --> 01:18:28.776
A scene was made.
What's going on with you, Jay?

01:18:32.219 --> 01:18:34.704
— Where were you?
— With Nicky.

01:18:34.787 --> 01:18:37.488
Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds.

01:18:37.617 --> 01:18:41.471
He certainly must have strained
himself to get this menagerie together.

01:18:43.861 --> 01:18:47.590
I'd like to know who he is.
What he does.

01:18:48.342 --> 01:18:51.674
And I think I'll make a point
of finding out.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:13.470
— I'm not sure. Ask them in the kitchen.
— To the left.

01:19:13.495 --> 01:19:16.595
Yeah, we'll pile that stuff in the garage,
it's going back to town.

01:19:30.088 --> 01:19:32.815
Oh, there you are!
Daisy just left.

01:19:32.856 --> 01:19:35.762
She asked me to tell you
she had a wonderful time.

01:19:35.978 --> 01:19:37.230
She didn't like it.

01:19:37.495 --> 01:19:40.311
— Of course she did!
— No, no no.

01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:44.864
No, she didn't like it, she…
she did not have a good time, I…

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:47.460
feel so far away from her now.

01:19:47.502 --> 01:19:49.148
So hard to make her understand.

01:19:49.295 --> 01:19:52.755
— You mean about the party?
— The party?

01:19:54.194 --> 01:19:56.455
I couldn't care less
about the parties.

01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:58.760
That will be all for now, gentlemen.

01:19:58.761 --> 01:19:59.882
Thank you.
— Thank you, sir.

01:20:00.892 --> 01:20:02.826
You see…

01:20:04.285 --> 01:20:07.269
She has to tell Tom that
she never loved him.

01:20:07.318 --> 01:20:08.750
— What?
— Yes.

01:20:09.462 --> 01:20:12.985
Then we can go back to Louisville
to her parents' house.

01:20:13.254 --> 01:20:15.888
Her parents are lovely people, old sport.

01:20:16.099 --> 01:20:18.405
We'll be married there.

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:24.191
See… See, Daisy and I are gonna
start over just as if it were 5 years ago.

01:20:24.248 --> 01:20:25.927
I wouldn't ask too much of her.

01:20:26.001 --> 01:20:27.987
— Wouldn't ask too much?
— No.

01:20:32.807 --> 01:20:35.442
I beg your pardon, old sport, it just…

01:20:35.863 --> 01:20:40.033
it's so sad because it is so hard
to make her understand.

01:20:40.509 --> 01:20:42.998
It's so hard to make
her understand.

01:20:42.999 --> 01:20:46.025
I've gotten all these things for her,
I've gotten all these things for her,

01:20:46.048 --> 01:20:48.937
now she just…
she just wants to run away.

01:20:50.256 --> 01:20:51.860
She even wants to leave that.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.912
Jay! You can't repeat the past.

01:20:57.407 --> 01:21:00.581
— Can't repeat the past?
— No.

01:21:01.997 --> 01:21:06.093
Why, of course you can.
Of course you can.

01:21:07.938 --> 01:21:11.402
See, I'm gonna fix things,
just the way they were before.

01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:15.548
Everything's been so…
so confused since that night.

01:21:16.988 --> 01:21:19.260
<i>He talked a lot about the past.</i>

01:21:20.054 --> 01:21:22.584
<i>As if he wanted to recover something.</i>

01:21:23.082 --> 01:21:27.405
If I c— if I could just
get back to the start.

01:21:29.247 --> 01:21:33.973
If I could just get back to the start…
I could find it again.

01:21:34.047 --> 01:21:39.139
<i>Some vision of himself that
he'd put into loving Daisy.</i>

01:21:40.575 --> 01:21:44.412
<i>One night in Louisville, five years ago,</i>

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:49.326
<i>Gatsby found himself at Daisy's
house by colossal accident.</i>

01:21:49.727 --> 01:21:53.518
So I went to her house first, with
some of the officers from Camp Taylor.

01:21:54.147 --> 01:21:56.903
I'd never been in such
a beautiful house before.

01:21:56.928 --> 01:21:58.242
May I save the next dance?

01:21:58.243 --> 01:22:02.891
<i>His uniform hid the truth,
that he was a penniless young man,</i>

01:22:03.472 --> 01:22:06.787
<i>with only that grand vision of himself.</i>

01:22:06.816 --> 01:22:09.150
— Daisy, don't scamper.
— I was not, mother.

01:22:09.185 --> 01:22:11.196
So many dashing young officers here,

01:22:11.253 --> 01:22:13.998
and from such illustrious families.

01:22:14.118 --> 01:22:17.290
I always knew that I could climb.

01:22:17.325 --> 01:22:20.177
But I could only climb if I climbed alone.

01:22:24.136 --> 01:22:28.467
I knew that when I kissed this girl…

01:22:30.697 --> 01:22:33.538
I would be forever wed to her.

01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:39.839
So I stopped.

01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:44.988
I stopped, and I…
I waited.

01:22:46.871 --> 01:22:49.609
I waited for a moment longer.

01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:55.231
<i>He knew his mind would never again
be free to romp like…</i>

01:22:56.994 --> 01:23:01.119
<i>the mind of God.</i>

01:23:02.327 --> 01:23:06.224
<i>That falling in love
would change his destiny…</i>

01:23:07.185 --> 01:23:09.605
<i>for ever.</i>

01:23:12.784 --> 01:23:15.783
Αnd then I just let myself go.

01:23:23.994 --> 01:23:27.097
<i>She blossomed for him like a flower…</i>

01:23:29.561 --> 01:23:32.795
<i>and the incarnation was complete.</i>

01:23:41.941 --> 01:23:45.757
I knew it was a great mistake
for a man like me to fall in love.

01:23:46.393 --> 01:23:52.454
I'm only 32, I might still be a great man if
I can forget that I once lost Daisy, but…

01:23:52.488 --> 01:23:57.650
my life, old sport, my life…
My life has got to be like this.

01:24:02.347 --> 01:24:04.991
It's got to keep going up.

01:24:10.418 --> 01:24:16.221
She has to go to Tom…
and tell him that she never loved him.

01:24:21.326 --> 01:24:25.487
I just need to give her more time,
old sport. More time.

01:24:31.953 --> 01:24:36.426
Don't worry old sport, don't worry.
I can protect her here.

01:24:39.109 --> 01:24:41.040
Good night, old sport.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:52.225
You're wrong about the past, old sport!

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:56.209
You're wrong.

01:25:20.133 --> 01:25:22.737
<i>There had been music from
my neighbor's all summer.</i>

01:25:23.067 --> 01:25:26.173
<i>In his blue gardens, men and
girls came and went like moths,</i>

01:25:26.217 --> 01:25:29.328
<i>among the whisperings and
the laughter and the stars.</i>

01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:33.959
— Breakfast?
— Yes. Thank you, thank you.

01:25:35.378 --> 01:25:38.506
Laughter.
Thank you.

01:25:39.907 --> 01:25:43.667
No, the whispering and the—
the champagne and the stars.

01:25:45.065 --> 01:25:46.993
But…

01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:54.085
<i>After Tom and Daisy's visit,
Gatsby's lights went out one by one.</i>

01:25:54.855 --> 01:25:57.626
<i>There were no more parties.</i>

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:02.530
<i>Daisy visited discreetly.</i>

01:26:05.339 --> 01:26:11.595
<i>For the very same fame that had all summer
been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby,</i>

01:26:12.428 --> 01:26:14.878
<i>had become a threat.</i>

01:26:43.561 --> 01:26:45.628
I don't wanna go home.

01:26:48.594 --> 01:26:51.294
I— I heard you fired all your servants.

01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:54.673
Daisy comes over sometimes
in the afternoon,

01:26:54.685 --> 01:27:00.487
I wanted people who wouldn't gossip
until we decide what we're going to do.

01:27:01.085 --> 01:27:04.966
You see, these towns are
very close together, old sport.

01:27:05.315 --> 01:27:07.927
If it gets in the papers, you understand?

01:27:07.981 --> 01:27:11.308
They're all people Wolfsheim
wanted to do something for.

01:27:11.769 --> 01:27:15.734
What's the difference as long as
they can cook and make beds, right?

01:27:19.392 --> 01:27:21.928
Nick, Daisy's ready.

01:27:21.971 --> 01:27:25.498
She's ready, there's just…
one thing she's requesting,

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:29.866
that you and Mrs Baker be there
for lunch tomorrow at her house.

01:27:31.581 --> 01:27:34.107
Will you come, old sport?

01:27:34.331 --> 01:27:36.213
Daisy needs you.

01:27:39.843 --> 01:27:42.147
We need you.

01:27:48.578 --> 01:27:51.047
Will you come, old sport?

01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:12.057
You know, I read somewhere that
the sun is getting hotter every year.

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:16.357
Wait a minute. It's the opposite.

01:28:16.701 --> 01:28:19.376
The sun is getting colder every year.

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:25.458
Oh I would like to be out
on that bay today.

01:28:28.188 --> 01:28:30.434
I'm right across from you.

01:28:33.321 --> 01:28:35.293
Right there.

01:28:40.425 --> 01:28:42.192
So you are.

01:28:47.234 --> 01:28:55.093
You see, every night I can see that
light at the end of your dock blinking.

01:28:56.783 --> 01:28:58.738
What light?

01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:09.721
You see, Mr. Buchanan,
I wanted to be close…

01:29:15.252 --> 01:29:17.025
Daisy and I have—
— It's so hot!

01:29:17.159 --> 01:29:19.203
Everything's so confused!

01:29:19.291 --> 01:29:21.363
What'll we do with ourselves
this afternoon or,

01:29:21.401 --> 01:29:23.355
the day after that, or
for the next thirty years?

01:29:23.463 --> 01:29:25.637
Oh, don't be morbid.

01:29:25.638 --> 01:29:27.375
Let's go to town.
Who wants to go to town?

01:29:27.376 --> 01:29:28.699
Town?

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.181
Oh! Women get these notions!

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.023
Daisy?

01:29:58.024 --> 01:30:00.160
You look so cool.

01:30:02.548 --> 01:30:05.029
He always looks so cool.

01:30:05.523 --> 01:30:08.683
Like the advertisement
of the man in Times Square.

01:30:10.424 --> 01:30:13.460
The man in the cool beautiful shirts.

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:22.543
<i>She had told Gatsby that she loved him.</i>

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:26.242
<i>And Tom had seen it.</i>

01:30:26.549 --> 01:30:28.319
Let's go to town!

01:30:28.607 --> 01:30:31.060
I'm perfectly willing.
It's a marvelous idea.

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:32.738
Henry, have the car
brought around now.

01:30:32.775 --> 01:30:35.146
Just like that? Can't anyone
at least have a cigarette first?

01:30:35.175 --> 01:30:36.554
We smoked all through lunch.

01:30:36.579 --> 01:30:39.558
Come on, let's have fun.
It's too hot to fuss.

01:30:39.611 --> 01:30:43.358
Daisy, it was your great idea!
Why don't we? Let's all go to town?

01:30:43.434 --> 01:30:45.536
I changed my mind, you brute.

01:30:45.579 --> 01:30:48.374
Oh come on, we'll get a
great big room at the Plaza.

01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:53.937
A bucket of ice, a bottle of whiskey
and it will be fun.

01:30:54.184 --> 01:30:57.138
Come on. It was your idea.

01:30:58.461 --> 01:31:00.437
Fine. Have it your own way, Tom.

01:31:00.684 --> 01:31:02.907
Come on, Jordan.

01:31:07.163 --> 01:31:09.564
Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?

01:31:10.029 --> 01:31:12.521
Two bottles of whiskey,
wrap them in a towel.

01:31:12.534 --> 01:31:13.805
Come on, Nick!

01:31:18.797 --> 01:31:22.506
Mr. Gatsby, would you be good
enough to take my coupé,

01:31:22.541 --> 01:31:24.840
 and I'll drive everyone
else in your circus wagon.

01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:27.650
I don't think there's much gas, old sport.

01:31:27.683 --> 01:31:29.628
Nope, plenty o' gas.

01:31:29.639 --> 01:31:32.092
Well, if I run out,
I'll stop at a drugstore.

01:31:32.225 --> 01:31:35.464
I hear you can buy anything
at a drugstore nowadays.

01:31:36.245 --> 01:31:39.918
— You take Nick and Jordan.
— I suppose you can, yes.

01:31:39.951 --> 01:31:41.840
We'll meet you at the Plaza.

01:31:41.886 --> 01:31:45.292
I'll be the man in the corner,
smoking two cigarettes.

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.133
You must think I'm
pretty dumb, don't you?

01:31:54.152 --> 01:31:57.064
But I have a second sight sometimes
that tells me what to do.

01:31:57.101 --> 01:31:59.303
I've made a small investigation
into this fellow.

01:31:59.330 --> 01:32:00.911
And you found he was an Oxford man?

01:32:00.937 --> 01:32:04.329
Oxford, New Mexico.
He wears a pink suit, for Christ sake.

01:32:29.012 --> 01:32:31.876
Tom, we're almost out of gas.

01:32:39.684 --> 01:32:43.388
Wilson? What are you waiting for?
Let's have some gas!

01:32:44.163 --> 01:32:45.970
Do I have to do it myself?

01:32:46.001 --> 01:32:47.479
Do you think I come here
to admire the view?

01:32:47.502 --> 01:32:49.127
Sorry uh, I'm sick.

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:50.742
Why?

01:32:50.923 --> 01:32:52.102
Why, what's the matter?

01:32:52.143 --> 01:32:54.976
I don't know, I'm… I all run down.

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:56.491
I need money real bad.

01:32:56.756 --> 01:32:59.814
— What?
— My wife and I, we wanna go west.

01:33:01.478 --> 01:33:03.813
Oh, your wife does?

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:07.229
<i>Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.</i>

01:33:07.871 --> 01:33:12.156
<i>His mistress and wife,
an hour ago so secure,</i>

01:33:12.224 --> 01:33:15.404
<i>were both slipping
from his control.</i>

01:33:15.454 --> 01:33:18.906
I wised up to something funny
these last two days.

01:33:19.946 --> 01:33:23.746
There she is. She's going West,
whether she wants it or not.

01:33:24.668 --> 01:33:28.311
— What do I owe you?
— A dollar. A dollar twenty.

01:33:28.533 --> 01:33:31.058
You can have the car.
I'll send it over tomorrow.

01:34:24.946 --> 01:34:26.953
Fine! Fine, fine.

01:34:28.301 --> 01:34:30.308
Open another window.

01:34:30.414 --> 01:34:31.552
There aren't any more.

01:34:31.667 --> 01:34:34.055
Then telephone for an axe.

01:34:34.102 --> 01:34:37.962
Will you forget about the heat?!
You make it worse by crabbing about it.

01:34:38.079 --> 01:34:40.983
Why not let her alone, old sport?

01:34:42.487 --> 01:34:45.447
That's a great expression
of yours, isn't it?

01:34:45.541 --> 01:34:46.441
What is?

01:34:47.287 --> 01:34:50.117
'Old sport'. Where did you pick it up?

01:34:50.225 --> 01:34:52.508
Now see here, Tom, if you're
gonna make personal remarks,

01:34:52.528 --> 01:34:53.807
I won't stay here a minute.

01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.596
Mr. Gatsby, I understand
you're an Oxford man.

01:35:02.802 --> 01:35:04.197
No. Not exactly, no.

01:35:04.297 --> 01:35:07.575
Oh yes, I understand that
you went to Oxford.

01:35:08.959 --> 01:35:10.289
Uh yes, I went there.

01:35:10.364 --> 01:35:13.987
Sure. The man in the
pink suit went to Oxford.

01:35:14.009 --> 01:35:15.386
Tom!

01:35:15.587 --> 01:35:17.222
I said I went there, didn't I?

01:35:17.364 --> 01:35:20.924
Oh, I heard you.
I'd like to know when.

01:35:21.496 --> 01:35:23.276
You'd like to know when?

01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:35.825
Well, Mr. Gatsby?

01:35:37.874 --> 01:35:40.835
It was in 1919,
I only stayed there 5 months,

01:35:40.852 --> 01:35:44.535
that's why I can't exactly
call myself an Oxford man.

01:35:44.562 --> 01:35:48.138
You see, it was an opportunity they
gave to some of us officers who—

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:49.405
who fought in the war.

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:53.852
<i>I wanted to get up and
slap Gatsby on the back.</i>

01:35:53.932 --> 01:35:55.569
I'll make you a drink, Tom.

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:57.815
Then you won't seem
so stupid to yourself.

01:35:57.884 --> 01:35:59.359
Wait a minute.

01:35:59.493 --> 01:36:02.725
I wanna ask Mr. Gatsby
one more question.

01:36:02.731 --> 01:36:05.018
Oh, please! Please go on,
Mr. Buchanan, go on.

01:36:05.466 --> 01:36:09.981
What kind of a row are you trying
to cause in my house anyhow?

01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:12.369
He isn't causing a row.
You're causing a row.

01:36:12.753 --> 01:36:14.274
Please have a little self-control.

01:36:14.375 --> 01:36:15.768
Self-control!

01:36:15.967 --> 01:36:19.393
Oh! I suppose the latest
thing is to sit back

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:23.246
and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere
make love to your wife.

01:36:23.412 --> 01:36:26.184
Well, if that's the idea,
you can count me out.

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:31.729
See, nowadays people begin by sneering
at family life and family institutions,

01:36:31.802 --> 01:36:34.458
and the next you'll know, we'll
throw everything overboard,

01:36:34.492 --> 01:36:36.744
and we'll have intermarriage
between black and white!

01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:39.056
Your wife doesn't love you!

01:36:44.343 --> 01:36:47.533
She never loved you.
You see, she loves me.

01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:55.166
— You must be crazy.
— No, old sport.

01:36:55.585 --> 01:36:59.072
No, you see… she never loved you.

01:36:59.329 --> 01:37:02.673
She only married you because I was
poor and she was tired of waiting,

01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:06.264
it was a terrible, terrible mistake,
but in her heart,

01:37:07.052 --> 01:37:09.525
in her heart she never
loved any one but me.

01:37:09.581 --> 01:37:10.861
— We should go.
— Stay.

01:37:10.895 --> 01:37:12.768
— Let's all go home.
— Sit down, Daisy!

01:37:12.823 --> 01:37:15.822
Please. Please take a seat.

01:37:16.426 --> 01:37:18.356
Come on, Daisy.

01:37:19.563 --> 01:37:20.867
Daisy?

01:37:22.249 --> 01:37:23.136
What's been going on?

01:37:23.178 --> 01:37:25.802
— I wanna hear all about it.
— I've just told you what's going on,

01:37:25.824 --> 01:37:27.716
it's been going on for five years.

01:37:27.924 --> 01:37:32.298
You've been seeing him… for five years?

01:37:32.355 --> 01:37:35.068
No, no. No, not seeing.
Not seeing, we couldn't but…

01:37:35.084 --> 01:37:38.070
both of us loved each other
all that time, didn't we?

01:37:39.112 --> 01:37:40.763
Oh, that's all?

01:37:42.042 --> 01:37:43.326
You're crazy!

01:37:43.469 --> 01:37:45.951
I can't speak about what
happened five years ago.

01:37:46.094 --> 01:37:47.764
Because I didn't
know Daisy then.

01:37:47.871 --> 01:37:51.021
And I'll be damned if I know
how you got within a mile of her,

01:37:51.064 --> 01:37:54.127
unless you brought the groceries
to the back door,

01:37:54.162 --> 01:37:59.117
but all the rest of that is a goddamn lie!
Daisy loved me when she married me,

01:37:59.170 --> 01:38:00.733
and she loves me now.

01:38:00.941 --> 01:38:01.782
— No! No.
— She does!

01:38:01.783 --> 01:38:03.894
— I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan.
— She does though!

01:38:03.931 --> 01:38:05.136
— No.
— Oh no no, she does though,

01:38:05.157 --> 01:38:07.317
she does, and what's more,
I love Daisy too.

01:38:13.264 --> 01:38:16.654
Though once in a while, I— I go off
on a spree, I always come back.

01:38:16.670 --> 01:38:18.822
— A spree!
— And in my heart I love—

01:38:18.842 --> 01:38:21.120
— I love her all the time.
— You're revolting.

01:38:21.185 --> 01:38:23.157
Do you know why we left Chicago?

01:38:23.239 --> 01:38:26.064
I'm surprised they didn't treat you
to the story of that little spree.

01:38:26.103 --> 01:38:28.875
Alright, that's all over now,
Daisy, darling, that's all over!

01:38:28.941 --> 01:38:32.308
Just tell them the truth, go on.
That you never loved him…

01:38:32.374 --> 01:38:35.320
and this… this will all
be wiped out forever.

01:38:35.354 --> 01:38:36.842
Why, how could I love him, possibly!

01:38:37.566 --> 01:38:40.211
Remember our plan, tell him
that you never loved him,

01:38:40.222 --> 01:38:42.120
and all this pain will be
wiped out forever.

01:38:44.656 --> 01:38:46.006
Daisy.

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:48.568
Daisy, tell him.

01:38:49.372 --> 01:38:51.566
I never loved him?

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.660
Never?

01:38:53.988 --> 01:38:56.237
— No.
— No.

01:38:57.077 --> 01:38:59.392
Not at Kapiolani?

01:39:02.704 --> 01:39:06.829
Not that day I carried you down from
the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?

01:39:10.885 --> 01:39:12.457
Never?

01:39:12.509 --> 01:39:14.626
Please don't.

01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:16.647
Daisy.

01:39:17.353 --> 01:39:21.086
No, Jay! You want too much.

01:39:21.356 --> 01:39:25.035
I love you now, isn't that enough?
I can't help what's past.

01:39:25.115 --> 01:39:28.775
I did love him once—
but I loved you too.

01:39:30.643 --> 01:39:34.289
You— you loved— you loved me <i>too</i> ?
You loved me…

01:39:34.586 --> 01:39:37.244
Even that is a lie! She did
not know that you were alive!

01:39:37.273 --> 01:39:40.183
There are things between Daisy and me,
Gatsby, that you'll never know!

01:39:40.211 --> 01:39:41.929
Things that neither of us
can ever forget!

01:39:41.953 --> 01:39:44.058
I just need to speak to
Daisy alone. You see, you—

01:39:44.082 --> 01:39:47.935
you've got her all excited now,
don't you old sport.

01:39:47.999 --> 01:39:48.877
Daisy, hey—

01:39:48.931 --> 01:39:51.890
Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,
it wouldn't be true.

01:39:52.217 --> 01:39:54.690
— Of course it wouldn't.
— As if it mattered to you.

01:39:54.734 --> 01:39:57.773
Of course it matters. Daisy, I'm gonna
take better care of you from now on.

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.696
You're not taking
care of Daisy anymore.

01:40:00.419 --> 01:40:02.118
— She's leaving you.
— Nonsense!

01:40:02.150 --> 01:40:04.001
— I am though!
— No no no no no.

01:40:04.033 --> 01:40:05.364
No, she is not leaving me.

01:40:05.461 --> 01:40:09.028
And certainly not for a
common swindler like you.

01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:11.371
Mr. Gatsby, exactly who are you, anyhow?

01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:13.968
You see, I have made a small
investigation into your affairs,

01:40:14.130 --> 01:40:16.219
You're one of Meyer
Wolfsheim's bunch.

01:40:16.255 --> 01:40:17.312
Please, let's go home!

01:40:17.346 --> 01:40:21.017
See, he ​​and this Wolfsheim,
they bought up a lot of drugstores,

01:40:21.252 --> 01:40:23.798
and sold bootleg alcohol over the counter.

01:40:23.824 --> 01:40:25.165
What about it, old sport?

01:40:25.199 --> 01:40:26.493
Don't you call me 'old sport'!

01:40:26.523 --> 01:40:29.081
And this drugstore business
is just small change

01:40:29.113 --> 01:40:32.199
compared to this bonds stunt that
you and Wolfsheim have got going.

01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:34.816
Your friend Walter Chase
isn't too proud to come in on it.

01:40:34.836 --> 01:40:36.324
I was giving it lots of thoughts.

01:40:36.325 --> 01:40:38.956
How does a reputable
banker like Walter Chase,

01:40:38.963 --> 01:40:41.063
find himself up to his eyeballs in debt—

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.305
— I'll tell you how.
— to a little kike like Wolfsheim?

01:40:43.338 --> 01:40:45.750
— It's called greed, old sport.
— That's right.

01:40:45.765 --> 01:40:49.417
And you have half of Wall Street
out there swilling your free booze,

01:40:49.435 --> 01:40:51.199
at that fun park every weekend.

01:40:51.301 --> 01:40:53.985
I'm surprised he hasn't
tried to drag you in.

01:40:55.642 --> 01:40:57.366
My God, he has.

01:40:57.438 --> 01:41:01.279
— He's got nothing to do with—
— with your odd little racket.

01:41:02.454 --> 01:41:04.345
Daisy?
Daisy!

01:41:06.009 --> 01:41:08.280
Can't you see who this guy is?

01:41:08.396 --> 01:41:13.186
With his house. And his parties.
And his fancy clothes.

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:17.905
He's just a front for Wolfsheim,
a gangster,

01:41:18.074 --> 01:41:20.800
to get his claws into respectable
folks like Walter Chase.

01:41:20.861 --> 01:41:23.862
The only respectable thing about you,
old sport, is your money.

01:41:24.336 --> 01:41:25.414
Your money, that's it.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.831
I have just as much as you,
that means we're equal.

01:41:27.855 --> 01:41:29.599
Oh, no! No.

01:41:30.519 --> 01:41:36.263
We're different.
I am, they are, she is.

01:41:36.597 --> 01:41:38.800
We're all different from you.

01:41:38.847 --> 01:41:41.213
You see, we were born different.

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:44.968
It's in our blood.

01:41:44.991 --> 01:41:49.078
And nothing that
you could do, say, or steal,

01:41:49.323 --> 01:41:52.245
or dream up, can ever change that.

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:53.804
A girl like Daisy—

01:41:53.850 --> 01:41:59.946
You shut up! Shut up!

01:42:08.404 --> 01:42:15.014
<i>Gatsby looked in that moment
as if he had killed a man.</i>

01:42:28.895 --> 01:42:32.982
My… My sincerest…

01:42:33.059 --> 01:42:36.878
My sincerest apologies.

01:42:39.456 --> 01:42:43.056
I seem to… have lost my temper.

01:42:43.661 --> 01:42:46.067
That's right, Mr. Gatsby.

01:42:46.813 --> 01:42:49.372
You showed us some of those
fine Oxford manners.

01:42:49.392 --> 01:42:51.477
Daisy, darling.

01:42:51.512 --> 01:42:54.966
None of this has… any consequence, I—

01:42:55.555 --> 01:42:59.713
Daisy.
Daisy, talk to me, darling.

01:42:59.851 --> 01:43:02.131
I just lost my temper, that's all.

01:43:02.246 --> 01:43:04.958
<i>He began talking excitedly.</i>

01:43:05.082 --> 01:43:09.249
<i>But with every word, Daisy was drawing
further and further into herself.</i>

01:43:09.274 --> 01:43:11.141
…to go to your parents' house
in Louisville.

01:43:11.142 --> 01:43:13.800
Please, Tom,
I can't stand it anymore!

01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:21.785
Why don't you two start on home,
in Mr. Gatsby's car.

01:43:21.810 --> 01:43:23.348
— Daisy, darling, look at me.
— Go on.

01:43:23.374 --> 01:43:25.957
— Daisy.
— He won't annoy you.

01:43:26.385 --> 01:43:29.557
I think he realizes that this
little flirtation is over.

01:43:29.598 --> 01:43:31.647
Daisy? Daisy!

01:43:45.306 --> 01:43:50.317
Do you want any of this?
Jordan? Nick?

01:43:52.617 --> 01:43:56.289
— Nick?
— What?

01:43:56.353 --> 01:43:59.056
— You want any?
— No.

01:44:00.553 --> 01:44:02.446
I just remembered…

01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:06.722
today is my birthday.

01:44:10.330 --> 01:44:12.310
Happy birthday.

01:44:14.527 --> 01:44:18.660
<i>Thirty. The promise
of a decade of loneliness.</i>

01:44:18.957 --> 01:44:22.381
<i>The formidable stroke
of thirty died away…</i>

01:44:22.496 --> 01:44:26.821
<i>as Gatsby and Daisy drove on
through the cooling twilight…</i>

01:44:28.651 --> 01:44:31.023
<i>towards death.</i>

01:44:34.304 --> 01:44:37.556
Don't you lie to me!
Where did you get this from?

01:44:37.583 --> 01:44:40.179
You might fool me, but you don't fool God!

01:44:40.338 --> 01:44:42.574
God sees everything!

01:44:44.467 --> 01:44:47.819
Myrtle! Where are you?

01:44:54.912 --> 01:44:57.588
Stop! Stop!

01:44:57.589 --> 01:45:01.959
— Myrtle! Baby!
— Stop!

01:45:03.796 --> 01:45:06.216
Please!

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.117
Slow down! Slow down!
Bad trouble up ahead, sir!

01:45:43.325 --> 01:45:47.382
Good! Wilson will have
a little business at last.

01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:49.431
Let's take a look.
— Oh, must we?

01:45:49.836 --> 01:45:51.449
Just a look.

01:45:51.924 --> 01:45:53.266
Come on!

01:45:58.823 --> 01:46:01.000
Move back! Clear the space here!

01:46:02.125 --> 01:46:04.125
Have a little respect!

01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:08.150
If you don't have a legitimate reason to
be in the building, I want you outside!

01:46:15.249 --> 01:46:18.531
If you saw anything tonight
you'd like to talk to me about,

01:46:18.557 --> 01:46:21.209
well, then you can talk to me outside.

01:46:21.234 --> 01:46:23.234
I don't want you in here. Okay?

01:46:25.232 --> 01:46:27.869
Please. Stand back. Please.

01:46:27.894 --> 01:46:29.894
Oh God.

01:46:30.919 --> 01:46:34.619
All right, folks. Make some room, huh?
Make some room back there!

01:46:35.344 --> 01:46:37.344
If you have no business, clear out!

01:46:53.259 --> 01:46:53.774
Sir?

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.332
What are you doing? Sir!

01:46:55.333 --> 01:46:58.269
Sir, I'm asking you to—
— Get off me!

01:46:58.477 --> 01:47:00.246
I'm fine!

01:47:01.451 --> 01:47:03.633
I'm fine.

01:47:04.996 --> 01:47:07.232
You knew her, eh?

01:47:12.943 --> 01:47:15.194
Not really. No.

01:47:16.863 --> 01:47:19.263
I gotta ask you to step back, sir.

01:47:22.583 --> 01:47:24.208
So what happened?

01:47:24.575 --> 01:47:26.891
She ran out in the road.

01:47:27.277 --> 01:47:30.315
Sonofabitch didn't even stop his car.

01:47:30.356 --> 01:47:34.083
Hey! I saw it. It was a yellow car.
A big yellow car.

01:47:34.246 --> 01:47:35.677
The damn thing came out of nowhere.

01:47:35.694 --> 01:47:39.507
Yeah. Yeah, big yellow Duesy.
Custom job.

01:47:40.612 --> 01:47:43.581
You have to tell me what
kind of car it was.

01:47:43.742 --> 01:47:45.467
I know what kind of car it was.

01:47:47.162 --> 01:47:50.727
— Wilson. Wilson, pull yourself together!
— I know what kind of car it was!

01:47:50.752 --> 01:47:51.788
He's upset!
Everybody out!

01:47:51.789 --> 01:47:54.682
Can't you see the man
needs peace and quiet! Listen!

01:47:54.763 --> 01:47:56.882
Wilson! I just—
I just got here from New York.

01:47:57.797 --> 01:48:01.030
Enough! Hey, Wilson!
I was bringing you the coupé.

01:48:01.153 --> 01:48:02.784
Sit down, sit down!

01:48:03.431 --> 01:48:04.883
Give him a drink!
Give him a drink!

01:48:04.949 --> 01:48:07.361
That yellow car wasn't mine.
D'you hear?

01:48:07.438 --> 01:48:09.236
I haven't seen it all afternoon.

01:48:09.303 --> 01:48:11.289
Hey!

01:48:11.329 --> 01:48:13.215
What color is your car?

01:48:13.323 --> 01:48:15.777
It's blue.
Coupé.

01:48:15.893 --> 01:48:17.292
We just got here from New York.

01:48:17.361 --> 01:48:18.867
Yeah, they just stopped.

01:48:26.261 --> 01:48:28.159
Okay.

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.757
Blue.

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:35.704
Here.

01:48:36.729 --> 01:48:37.979
Leave us alone.

01:48:39.005 --> 01:48:39.754
Wilson.

01:48:45.247 --> 01:48:48.004
Who owns the yellow car?

01:48:50.879 --> 01:48:54.142
A fella named Gatsby.
Jay Gatsby.

01:48:55.957 --> 01:48:58.218
He's a crook, George. Yes…

01:48:58.801 --> 01:49:02.674
throws all those parties the papers
are always talking about.

01:49:08.037 --> 01:49:11.995
Maybe he was the one that was
fooling around with Myrtle.

01:49:12.344 --> 01:49:14.755
Maybe that's why he killed her!

01:49:14.812 --> 01:49:16.344
Yeah, maybe.

01:49:18.731 --> 01:49:21.481
A guy like that, who knows?

01:49:24.221 --> 01:49:27.578
He didn't have to kill her.

01:49:35.977 --> 01:49:37.422
Gatsby.

01:49:38.537 --> 01:49:42.449
Something ought to be done
about a fella like that.

01:49:44.849 --> 01:49:48.262
He'll pay.
Oh, he will pay.

01:49:55.416 --> 01:49:57.338
Coward!

01:49:58.371 --> 01:50:00.499
He didn't even stop his car.

01:50:02.638 --> 01:50:05.029
You're gonna defend him now?

01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:26.261
I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick.

01:50:26.311 --> 01:50:29.063
Why don't you come inside
and have some supper while you wait?

01:50:29.198 --> 01:50:31.998
No thanks. I'll wait outside.

01:50:33.493 --> 01:50:35.869
What is the matter with you?

01:50:40.466 --> 01:50:43.044
— Won't you come in, Nick.
— No Thanks .

01:50:43.058 --> 01:50:46.841
— It's only half past nine.
— No, I've had enough! Of everyone.

01:51:02.775 --> 01:51:05.120
Hello, old sport.

01:51:13.209 --> 01:51:15.335
What are you doing?

01:51:16.318 --> 01:51:19.474
— Just sitting here.
— Yes, I see that!

01:51:19.701 --> 01:51:21.560
Did you see any trouble out on the road?

01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:23.681
That woman you ran down is dead, Jay!

01:51:23.996 --> 01:51:26.945
I thought so, I…
I told Daisy that I thought so.

01:51:26.992 --> 01:51:28.316
It's better that the shock—
— Daisy?

01:51:28.329 --> 01:51:30.037
— …should all come at once.
— Do you hear yourself?

01:51:30.061 --> 01:51:31.726
How could you?
How could you do that?

01:51:31.772 --> 01:51:32.896
— Keep your voice down!
— What's wrong with you?

01:51:32.922 --> 01:51:34.838
You're nothing but a goddamn coward!

01:51:34.874 --> 01:51:38.494
Keep your voice down, please!
There was no point in stop—

01:51:38.536 --> 01:51:41.642
No point ? No point!
What about that woman?

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:44.253
No point. She was— she was—
she was killed instantly.

01:51:44.346 --> 01:51:47.011
Yes, it ripped her open!
I was there, I saw it!

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:50.353
I understand! I understand you.
It was my fault!

01:51:50.478 --> 01:51:53.597
It was my fault, this woman,
she rushed out at us as if she was—

01:51:53.598 --> 01:51:55.752
See, she was trying to speak to us,

01:51:55.759 --> 01:51:58.383
it all happened so quickly!
She tried—

01:51:58.923 --> 01:52:01.436
I tried to turn in time, but—
— She?

01:52:18.365 --> 01:52:20.522
That was Daisy?!

01:52:24.918 --> 01:52:27.477
No, I…

01:52:29.172 --> 01:52:32.494
You see, after we left
New York, she was…

01:52:32.548 --> 01:52:34.785
she was very nervous, she thought…

01:52:35.602 --> 01:52:37.967
that driving would steady her.

01:52:38.001 --> 01:52:42.088
But… this woman, she rushed out at us.

01:52:44.387 --> 01:52:46.906
It all happened so quickly.

01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:49.131
It wasn't her fault, d'you see?

01:53:11.119 --> 01:53:13.953
No one must know that Daisy was driving.

01:53:15.599 --> 01:53:17.728
Promise me.

01:53:18.042 --> 01:53:19.395
Jay.

01:53:19.581 --> 01:53:21.714
You should go home
and get some rest.

01:53:21.782 --> 01:53:23.267
I'm going to wait here.

01:53:23.367 --> 01:53:25.499
I'm gonna wait here
all night, if necessary.

01:53:25.512 --> 01:53:27.081
No, no, no. That's not a good idea.

01:53:27.098 --> 01:53:30.392
If he tries to bother her about
that unpleasantness this afternoon,

01:53:30.414 --> 01:53:31.832
if he tries to bother her,

01:53:31.851 --> 01:53:33.456
if he tries any brutality—
— Wait!

01:53:33.472 --> 01:53:35.818
— on her, whatsoever,
— Tom— Tom won't touch her,

01:53:35.846 --> 01:53:38.825
— He's not even thinking about her, Jay.
— I don't trust him.

01:53:38.873 --> 01:53:43.480
I don't trust him.
— Alright. Alright.

01:53:46.213 --> 01:53:48.011
You wait here.

01:53:49.163 --> 01:53:51.511
I'll see if there's any commotion.

01:53:52.369 --> 01:53:55.019
Would you?

01:53:57.993 --> 01:53:59.866
Thank you, old sport.

01:54:08.837 --> 01:54:11.037
Listen, she was in the wrong,
running out on the road.

01:54:11.063 --> 01:54:12.886
Sweetheart, you have
nothing to worry about.

01:54:12.933 --> 01:54:17.454
Let me take care of things.
Take care of you.

01:54:17.479 --> 01:54:19.479
I'll make some calls.
We'll go away.

01:54:20.855 --> 01:54:24.018
Just go away, get out of town.

01:54:24.019 --> 01:54:27.647
Get some rest. Don't worry.
It'll be alright.

01:55:01.524 --> 01:55:04.277
— Hello, old sport.
— Jay.

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:08.575
— Is everything alright?
— Yes. Everything's just fine.

01:55:09.652 --> 01:55:12.896
At four o'clock, she—
she came at the window.

01:55:13.739 --> 01:55:15.113
She stood there, then…

01:55:16.469 --> 01:55:19.074
she turned out the lights, so…

01:55:19.099 --> 01:55:21.101
Well…

01:55:21.932 --> 01:55:24.432
Give me a hand, will you, old sport?

01:55:24.685 --> 01:55:27.982
<i>I should have told him
what I had just seen, but…</i>

01:55:29.058 --> 01:55:31.511
<i>All I could manage was:</i>

01:55:31.877 --> 01:55:35.417
You know Jay, with everything that's
happened, you ought to go away.

01:55:35.524 --> 01:55:37.676
Tonight. They'll trace your car.

01:55:37.698 --> 01:55:40.448
Go away? No. I can't leave now.
Not tonight.

01:55:40.571 --> 01:55:42.664
Jay, do you understand that
a woman has been killed?

01:55:42.718 --> 01:55:44.782
Daisy's gonna call in the morning.

01:55:45.191 --> 01:55:48.519
Then we'll make plans,
to go away together.

01:55:50.099 --> 01:55:51.203
Uh, Daisy, she—

01:55:51.216 --> 01:55:53.053
She just needs time
to think things through.

01:55:53.054 --> 01:55:56.751
Herzog! We're talking. Thank you.

01:55:59.874 --> 01:56:04.582
She just needs time to think—
— No, Jay… Daisy—

01:56:04.637 --> 01:56:08.886
She just needs time to think,
she's going to call in the morning.

01:56:17.765 --> 01:56:20.048
Wait up with me.

01:56:23.986 --> 01:56:26.521
The sun's almost up.

01:56:29.444 --> 01:56:33.119
<i>That was the night he
finally told me the truth.</i>

01:56:33.328 --> 01:56:34.245
<i>All of it.</i>

01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:41.529
You know, I thought for a while
I had a lot of things, but…

01:56:42.091 --> 01:56:45.124
the truth is I'm…
I'm empty.

01:56:45.153 --> 01:56:48.119
I suppose that's why I make
things up about myself,

01:56:48.135 --> 01:56:51.855
but I wanted to tell you the whole
story for a very long time.

01:56:53.476 --> 01:56:56.655
You see, I grew up terribly,
terribly poor, old sport.

01:56:56.963 --> 01:56:59.902
My folks were…
<i>— He revealed his humble beginnings,</i>

01:57:00.010 --> 01:57:03.415
<i>his transformative voyage with Dan Cody.</i>

01:57:03.496 --> 01:57:09.265
<i>The war, Oxford, and how
he joined Wolfsheim in the business.</i>

01:57:11.035 --> 01:57:17.279
<i>That was also that night that I became aware
of Gatsby's extraordinary gift for hope.</i>

01:57:17.312 --> 01:57:18.840
I can't describe how surprised I was

01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:21.512
to find out that I loved her, old sport,
and that she loved me too.

01:57:21.586 --> 01:57:24.786
<i>A gift that I have never found
in any other person…</i>

01:57:24.835 --> 01:57:29.148
I never realized how extraordinary
a nice girl could be.

01:57:29.338 --> 01:57:32.766
<i>…and which it is not likely
I shall ever find again.</i>

01:57:32.967 --> 01:57:36.658
I thought out my life with Daisy in it,
trying to figure out how we could marry,

01:57:36.686 --> 01:57:39.242
and struggle along on
so many dollars a month.

01:57:40.676 --> 01:57:42.954
What was in the letter?

01:57:44.882 --> 01:57:48.911
The reason why after the war, I…
I hadn't been able to return.

01:57:50.201 --> 01:57:55.570
I asked her to wait until I made
something of myself. But she was…

01:57:56.132 --> 01:57:58.574
See, I felt married to her.

01:58:01.408 --> 01:58:03.001
That was all.

01:58:03.696 --> 01:58:09.432
<i>It was all for her. The house,
the parties. Everything.</i>

01:58:16.666 --> 01:58:18.702
God sees everything.

01:58:27.471 --> 01:58:30.037
Mr. Gatsby, sir, excuse me.

01:58:30.038 --> 01:58:32.508
— Chicago called, it's—
— Not now.

01:58:33.588 --> 01:58:39.034
— Keep it open for a personal call.
— A personal call? Of course.

01:58:39.171 --> 01:58:41.987
Excuse me sir, Mr. Gatsby,
I'm gonna drain the pool today,

01:58:41.994 --> 01:58:43.769
before the leaves start falling in.

01:58:43.789 --> 01:58:45.323
Not today.

01:58:47.769 --> 01:58:50.136
Not today. It's so beautiful.

01:58:50.805 --> 01:58:52.261
You know, old sport…

01:58:53.368 --> 01:58:55.654
I haven't used that pool once all summer.

01:58:55.684 --> 01:58:59.561
Let's take a swim.
Have the phone brought down to the pool.

01:59:13.645 --> 01:59:16.055
I have to go, Jay.

01:59:18.121 --> 01:59:21.252
I have to work.
— I understand.

01:59:23.054 --> 01:59:25.496
Well. I'll walk you out.

01:59:33.754 --> 01:59:39.440
— Well, I'll call you up.
— Please do, old sport. Please do.

01:59:42.321 --> 01:59:45.120
I suppose that Daisy will call too.

01:59:48.385 --> 01:59:53.044
I… Well I suppose.

01:59:53.045 --> 01:59:54.204
Yes.

01:59:56.564 --> 01:59:58.747
Well. Goodbye.

02:00:17.746 --> 02:00:19.977
Jay?

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:23.407
They're a rotten crowd.

02:00:24.096 --> 02:00:27.412
You're worth the whole
damn bunch put together.

02:00:37.413 --> 02:00:40.148
<i>I was always glad I said that.</i>

02:00:42.025 --> 02:00:45.397
<i>It was the only compliment
I ever paid him.</i>

02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:54.194
<i>That morning, Wall Street
boomed its usual golden roar.</i>

02:00:54.266 --> 02:00:57.677
<i>But I wasn't worth
a decent stroke of work.</i>

02:00:58.693 --> 02:01:01.871
<i>And I waited for Gatsby
to call with news…</i>

02:01:04.163 --> 02:01:06.957
<i>while he waited for Daisy.</i>

02:01:50.114 --> 02:01:52.369
Gatsby's?

02:01:52.865 --> 02:01:57.030
I know Mr. Gatsby will be
very happy that you've called.

02:02:18.392 --> 02:02:21.100
Daisy…

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:46.656
Hello ? Hello?
Hello, is everything all right?

02:02:52.366 --> 02:02:55.027
Hello? Hello?

02:03:08.931 --> 02:03:13.999
<i>I remember the rest of that day
as an endless drill of police</i>

02:03:14.031 --> 02:03:17.002
<i>and photographers and tabloid reporters.</i>

02:03:18.605 --> 02:03:21.417
<i>The headlines were a nightmare.</i>

02:03:21.969 --> 02:03:24.280
<i>They pinned everything on Gatsby.</i>

02:03:24.332 --> 02:03:28.693
<i>The affair with Myrtle,
the hit and run, everything.</i>

02:03:28.757 --> 02:03:31.091
<i>And there was nothing I could say,</i>

02:03:31.153 --> 02:03:36.167
<i>except the one unutterable fact
that none of it was true.</i>

02:03:36.262 --> 02:03:39.969
Darling, Daddy's taking care
of his two favorite girls.

02:03:40.011 --> 02:03:42.987
— Where are we going?
— We're going on a holiday.

02:03:43.036 --> 02:03:45.705
— We should go.
— Just you, me and Daddy.

02:03:49.334 --> 02:03:50.679
Buchanan residence.

02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:54.540
May I speak to Mrs. Buchanan?
It's Mr. Carraway, her cousin.

02:03:54.563 --> 02:03:57.007
Madame is not available,
Monsieur Carraway.

02:03:57.379 --> 02:04:00.188
If you speak to her, tell her
the funeral's tomorrow.

02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:02.763
I'm sorry, Monsieur.
They have gone away.

02:04:02.798 --> 02:04:05.115
Gone away! Do you know
when they'll be back?

02:04:08.503 --> 02:04:11.862
No. They have already departed.

02:04:14.968 --> 02:04:19.613
Please. I know that she would
want to be there, she would—

02:04:19.614 --> 02:04:22.707
If you'd just get a message to her,
let me talk to her, please.

02:04:22.721 --> 02:04:27.601
You wish to contact her…
I have no further information, Monsieur.

02:04:27.790 --> 02:04:29.828
— Please!
— Αu revoir.

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:32.858
I…
Hello?

02:04:41.608 --> 02:04:48.383
<i>They were careless people, Tom and Daisy.
They smashed up things and people,</i>

02:04:48.406 --> 02:04:52.860
<i>and then retreated back into their
money and their vast carelessness.</i>

02:04:54.764 --> 02:04:58.064
Hey! Hey!
Get out of here!

02:04:58.084 --> 02:05:02.151
Go on! Get the hell out of here!

02:05:14.667 --> 02:05:19.114
<i>I rang, I wrote, I implored.</i>

02:05:20.577 --> 02:05:26.179
<i>But not a single one of the sparkling
hundreds that enjoyed his hospitality,</i>

02:05:26.387 --> 02:05:30.993
<i>attended the funeral.
And from Daisy…</i>

02:05:32.053 --> 02:05:34.442
<i>not even a flower.</i>

02:05:35.789 --> 02:05:40.902
<i>I was all he had.
The only one who cared.</i>

02:06:12.222 --> 02:06:17.177
<i>After Gatsby's death,
New York was haunted for me.</i>

02:06:18.848 --> 02:06:20.804
<i>That city…</i>

02:06:22.131 --> 02:06:26.056
<i>my once golden shimmering mirage…</i>

02:06:27.512 --> 02:06:30.373
<i>now made me sick.</i>

02:06:33.250 --> 02:06:35.955
<i>On my last night in New York,</i>

02:06:36.728 --> 02:06:41.760
<i>I returned to that huge
incoherent house once more.</i>

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:45.294
<i>Wolfsheim Associates had cleaned it out.</i>

02:06:45.335 --> 02:06:48.571
He threw all those parties,
hoping she would wander in one night.

02:06:48.599 --> 02:06:50.300
It's like an amusement park!

02:06:50.328 --> 02:06:51.966
How do you live here all alone?

02:06:52.014 --> 02:06:55.283
She makes it look so— so splendid,
don't you think, old sport?

02:06:55.857 --> 02:06:59.897
Music! And then we can dance all night.

02:07:01.524 --> 02:07:03.745
Will you come, old sport?
We need you.

02:07:03.792 --> 02:07:05.955
I wish it could always be like this.

02:07:06.584 --> 02:07:08.779
It will be.

02:07:09.857 --> 02:07:15.928
<i>I remembered how we had all come to
Gatsby's and guessed at his corruption,</i>

02:07:16.489 --> 02:07:22.164
<i>while he stood before us,
concealing an incorruptible dream.</i>

02:07:22.893 --> 02:07:27.555
It's perfect. From your perfect
irresistible imagination.

02:07:33.906 --> 02:07:36.650
<i>The moon rose higher.</i>

02:07:37.343 --> 02:07:41.551
<i>And as I stood there,
brooding on an old unknown world,</i>

02:07:41.913 --> 02:07:45.743
<i>I thought of Gatsby's wonder when
he first picked out the green light</i>

02:07:45.764 --> 02:07:48.269
<i>at the end of Daisy's dock.</i>

02:07:53.312 --> 02:07:56.467
<i>He had come such a long way,</i>

02:07:56.529 --> 02:08:02.352
<i>and his dream must have seemed so close
that he could hardly fail to grasp it…</i>

02:08:06.384 --> 02:08:09.950
<i>But he did not know that
it was already behind him.</i>

02:08:11.546 --> 02:08:14.637
<i>Gatsby believed in the green light,</i>

02:08:14.851 --> 02:08:19.380
<i>the orgastic future that year
by year recedes before us.</i>

02:08:19.702 --> 02:08:22.589
<i>It eluded us then,
but that's no matter.</i>

02:08:22.724 --> 02:08:28.035
<i>Tomorrow we will run faster,
stretch out our arms farther…</i>

02:08:28.809 --> 02:08:33.330
<i>And one fine morning—
So we beat on,</i>

02:08:33.882 --> 02:08:40.284
<i>boats against the current,
borne back ceaselessly</i>

02:08:40.979 --> 02:08:44.341
<i>into the past.</i>
