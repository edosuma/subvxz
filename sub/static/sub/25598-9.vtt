WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:04.160
There was a guard
who was getting suspicious

00:04.254 --> 00:05.540
of what was
going on in there.

00:05.631 --> 00:06.816
They wanted me
to put him down.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.502
I told him
I wouldn't do it

00:08.592 --> 00:10.752
until whoever was running
the show came to me directly.

00:10.844 --> 00:15.179
- And who exactly was that?
- Roger Shapiro. CEO of Reform Corp.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.222
- And then what happened?
- I killed him.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.801
So you two
are in on this together.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.511
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:21.605 --> 00:24.393
You're never gonna pull
this shit again on prisoners.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.691
That's a signed confession
from Roger Shapiro,

00:26.777 --> 00:28.129
saying he entered
into a conspiracy

00:28.153 --> 00:30.270
and that conspiracy
was arranged by you.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.151
Look, I'm not going
to stand here

00:32.241 --> 00:34.733
and write my resignation letter
in front of you two.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.055
- What's going on with you and Brian?
- Donna, he's married.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.115
I would never do it.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.391
I know, but I also know that
the heart doesn't always listen

00:40.415 --> 00:42.015
to what the brain
says it would never do.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.495
- Denise Gallo?
- Who are you?

00:43.585 --> 00:45.827
Someone who knew your father.
He wanted you to have this.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.710
- Did you know?
- Know what?

00:47.756 --> 00:50.151
That Gavin Andrews was gonna
ask me to launder money for him?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.007
I knew he was gonna
ask you to do something.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.210
Help me get out of this.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.572
What the hell did you do
with my money?

00:54.596 --> 00:55.990
I found you a legitimate
business opportunity.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.550
- You're fired.
- I don't think so.

00:57.641 --> 00:58.927
Because if I can
do this to you,

00:59.017 --> 01:00.679
imagine what I can
do for you.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.528 --> 01:10.860
- Hello.
<i>- There you are.</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:12.666
<i>What the hell time
do you get to the office?</i>

01:12.698 --> 01:14.842
I'm at my desk ten minutes
before I need to be every morning,

01:14.866 --> 01:16.107
which means
you tracked me down.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.487
The question is, why?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.160
Because we've got a situation.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.408
<i>- What did you do now?</i>
- I didn't do anything.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.490
One of my transport flights
was carrying some art.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.995
Apparently the hull
depressurized,

01:25.085 --> 01:26.667
and one of the pieces
got damaged.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.870
- What kind of art?
<i>- The expensive kind.</i>

01:28.964 --> 01:30.775
Well, then it had to be insured,
so what's the problem?

01:30.799 --> 01:33.337
The problem is the insurance
inspector just left here,

01:33.427 --> 01:35.267
and the son of a bitch
has got the balls to say

01:35.345 --> 01:37.007
they'd be suing me
for the damages.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.508
<i>All right, I'll get into it.</i>

01:38.599 --> 01:39.806
Who's the insurance company?

01:39.891 --> 01:42.850
<i>- Dexhart Insurance Group.</i>
- Shit.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.539
<i>What's the matter?
Is that gonna be a problem?</i>

01:44.563 --> 01:46.323
Just tell me,
have the papers been filed yet?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.689
Why do you think
I'm calling you this early?

01:54.031 --> 01:55.067
Louis.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.031
This is silly.
Where are you taking me?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.324
Relax. We're there.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.229
Then can I take off
this blindfold?

02:00.287 --> 02:03.655
No. Not until you guess exactly
where we are right now.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.036
We're in my new office.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.606
What the f...
How could you know that?

02:07.669 --> 02:09.814
Because you told me
I'd make senior partner next quarter,

02:09.838 --> 02:10.874
and it's next quarter.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.233
Now can I take
this blindfold off?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.697
Holy shit, you just suck the fun out
of everything, don't you?

02:16.261 --> 02:17.502
In that case,

02:18.430 --> 02:20.342
I have dreamt
about making senior partner

02:20.432 --> 02:22.014
since I was
nine years old.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.347
You not only fought
for me to get this...

02:26.521 --> 02:28.478
I wouldn't even
be at this firm without you.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.691
And on top
of all that, Louis...

02:32.986 --> 02:35.774
This office is the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.157
All right. I was wrong.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.905
You don't suck
the fun out of anything.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.113
Thank you, Louis.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.414
Thank you
for fighting for me.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.752
- Samantha, we need to talk.
- Let me guess...

02:51.838 --> 02:53.124
- Gavin called you.
- He did.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.317
Then you know
we have a conflict,

02:54.341 --> 02:56.069
which means one of us
has to drop their client.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.629
So, do you have
Gavin's private line,

02:57.719 --> 02:58.905
or do you need me
to give it to you?

02:58.929 --> 03:00.740
I don't need anything,
because you're gonna call up

03:00.764 --> 03:03.159
Dexhart Insurance and tell them
you can't handle this particular matter.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.411
Are you kidding me? You wouldn't
even have Gavin if it weren't for me.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.205
It doesn't matter how I got him,
I'm not dropping him.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.165
Alex, I told you,
the guy isn't worth the trouble.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.930
View this as an opportunity
to cut him loose

03:11.024 --> 03:12.502
- and be done with it.
- Wait a second.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.170
Did your client say they wanted
to sue mine,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.401
or did you suggest
it to them?

03:15.487 --> 03:16.589
What difference
does it make?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.132
The difference is
I thought we were past this.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.051
But if this is how you're making
your play for name partner,

03:20.075 --> 03:21.719
- it's not gonna work.
- The only play I'm making

03:21.743 --> 03:23.450
is to protect
my client from yours,

03:23.537 --> 03:25.199
because Gavin
sabotaged that plane,

03:25.288 --> 03:27.905
and I know that because I know
everything else he's done.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.686
And you just admitted
using privileged information

03:29.710 --> 03:30.791
against a former client.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.522
And I could have you
tossed off this just for that.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.149
You mean information like using a member
of your client's family against them?

03:35.173 --> 03:36.401
That's not breaking privilege,
and you know it.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.736
And neither is catching that asshole
with his hand in the cookie jar.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.780
Cut the bullshit, Samantha,
and step out of the ring,

03:40.804 --> 03:42.907
because this isn't happening
no matter how much you want it to.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.342
I don't want it.
My client does.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.313
And I've never stepped out
of a ring in my life.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.018
So, either call Gavin
or someone can do it for you,

03:49.104 --> 03:51.266
because this case
is moving forward.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.691
Nice home you've made
for yourself here, Robert.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.777
Nicer than the home
you should have, Tommy,

04:06.204 --> 04:07.365
since you belong in prison.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.914
Funny you should say that,
'cause that's exactly why I'm here.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.081
What are you
talking about?

04:11.168 --> 04:13.768
I'm talking about the fact
that you're sitting pretty in this firm

04:13.837 --> 04:15.022
after you forced me
out of mine.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.207
You're lucky
that's all I did,

04:16.298 --> 04:19.416
because you're responsible
for the deaths of multiple inmates.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.875
- According to you.
- According to Frank Gallo.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.250
That's right,
you got him on tape

04:23.305 --> 04:25.092
saying what monsters
we all are.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.800
And then you used it to blackmail me
into early retirement.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.977
But that gave me
plenty of time to think.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.679
Why the hell would
Frank Gallo cooperate with you

04:33.774 --> 04:35.811
if it meant
admitting to murder?

04:35.901 --> 04:37.044
What are you
getting at, Tommy?

04:37.068 --> 04:40.857
You and this firm offered
Frank Gallo money for his daughter

04:40.947 --> 04:45.612
in exchange for fabricated testimony
that you used to leverage me.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.694
Now I'm here
to make you pay.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.286
You're coming at us to get revenge
for something you actually did.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.992
I'm coming at you
for what's owed to me,

04:55.086 --> 04:57.578
which is the compensation
for the firm that I lost.

04:57.672 --> 05:01.211
And how about you compensate the families
of the people that you had killed?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.840
Because the only thing that you are
owed are a pair of prison stripes.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.388
And if you do this,
I promise you'll get them.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.809
Robert, if I wanted empty threats,
I would have brought this right to Harvey.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.012
But I didn't,
because I wanted to be here

05:14.105 --> 05:16.267
to see the look on your face
when you realized

05:16.358 --> 05:17.940
I'm going
to take you all down.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.435
Just like you did to me.

05:24.908 --> 05:28.151
<i>See the money,
wanna stay for your meal</i>

05:28.245 --> 05:31.283
<i>Get another piece of pie
for your wife</i>

05:31.373 --> 05:34.741
<i>Everybody wanna know
how it feel</i>

05:34.835 --> 05:38.203
<i>Everybody wanna see
what it's like</i>

05:38.296 --> 05:41.460
<i>I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind</i>

05:41.550 --> 05:43.382
<i>Me and missy is so early</i>

05:43.468 --> 05:45.334
<i>Busy, busy making money</i>

05:45.428 --> 05:46.509
<i>All right!</i>

05:46.721 --> 05:51.807
<i>All step back
I'm 'bout to dance</i>

05:52.602 --> 05:54.218
<i>The greenback boogie</i>

05:58.441 --> 05:59.544
Let me get this straight.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.151
Tommy Bratton
is accusing us of conspiracy

06:02.237 --> 06:03.339
and suing us for $20 million.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.650
Blackmailing us
for $20 million.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.780
Call it whatever you want.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.261
I'm not giving that
son of a bitch one nickel.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.554
Well, what are we
going to do, Robert?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.618
Because, I hate to say it,
we did conspire with you.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.015
I'll tell you
what we're going to do.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.017
We're gonna go through
every piece of communication

06:15.041 --> 06:16.077
on that case

06:16.167 --> 06:18.287
and make sure there's nothing
linking me to this firm.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.170
Robert, I went to your house.
Mike went to your house.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.966
We never exchanged one email,
phone call. We're good.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.089
And I don't feel like risking
my future on your memory.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.408
Wait a minute. Maybe we don't have
to risk anything on anything.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.576
What are you talking about?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.910
I'm talking about someone
close to Bratton

06:32.934 --> 06:35.221
who might be able to stop
this thing dead in its tracks.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.935
- Eli Gould.
- Exactly.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.684
He was Bratton's partner,
and what's more,

06:38.773 --> 06:39.876
Alex got him on tape admitting

06:39.900 --> 06:41.732
that he committed
a disbarrable offense.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.731
Which means you've been dangling
a sword over his head ever since.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.858
Guess what.
I got the sword right here.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.440
That settles it.
We have our game plan.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.491
Hold on. If this thing
goes to trial,

06:51.578 --> 06:53.069
couldn't Bratton
end up in prison?

06:53.163 --> 06:54.449
What are you
getting at, Donna?

06:54.539 --> 06:56.952
Why would he risk that
just to get revenge?

06:57.042 --> 06:58.249
Because people do crazy things

06:58.335 --> 06:59.895
when they think
they've lost everything.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.377
Now, let's get to it.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.162
We've all got
something to do.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.698
Samantha, whatever it is,
now is not the time.

07:10.722 --> 07:14.090
Too bad. We have a problem,
and his name is Gavin Andrews.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.425
Oh, what now
with that man?

07:15.518 --> 07:16.634
Long story short,

07:16.728 --> 07:19.641
Dexhart Insurance needs
to sue Starboard Airlines.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.472
And how exactly
is that supposed to happen

07:21.566 --> 07:23.148
when we represent them both?

07:23.234 --> 07:24.274
Why do you think I'm here?

07:24.361 --> 07:25.401
Oh, you better not be here

07:25.487 --> 07:27.194
to get me to tell Alex
to drop his client.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.522
Robert, you know Gavin
is not worth the headache.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.652
He needs to go.

07:30.742 --> 07:31.778
Here's a better idea.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.904
Since you and Alex

07:32.994 --> 07:34.030
each just lost a client,

07:34.120 --> 07:36.112
these two clients stay.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.242
What?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.662
You think I wouldn't find out
about that Rand Kaldor shit?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.771
- Robert, I was gonna...
- Listen to me.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.081
This firm is under attack.
We can't do this right now.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.318
What do you mean
under attack?

07:47.342 --> 07:51.052
That's none of your concern. What is
your concern is fixing this situation.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.298
And how do we do that

07:52.389 --> 07:54.221
when neither client
is gonna back down?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.970
I'll tell you how.
You and Alex stop acting like children.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.177
Get your clients in a room
and get them to settle.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.248
And what do you propose we do
when that doesn't work?

08:01.272 --> 08:04.140
Samantha, instead of taking up
more time that I don't have,

08:04.234 --> 08:05.600
I propose you make it work.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.111
Good morning, Katrina.
Can I help you with something?

08:17.205 --> 08:19.071
If this conversation
goes as planned,

08:19.165 --> 08:20.977
you're going to be helping me
with a lot of things.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.333
I don't understand.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.580
I just made senior partner.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.955
- So it's official?
- It's official.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.333
And, as my first act,

08:31.136 --> 08:34.129
Brian Simon Altman,
will you be my associate?

08:35.306 --> 08:36.797
Katrina, I'm honored.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.304
But before I answer,

08:39.394 --> 08:43.263
are you sure the two of us working
so closely together is a good idea?

08:45.108 --> 08:47.191
- What?
- I mean, we've become good friends,

08:47.986 --> 08:51.605
so it might get complicated
if I officially work for you.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.782
I appreciate that, Brian,
but I'm okay with it if you are.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.111
In that case, I would love
to be your associate.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.287
Then I suggest we start
with some ground rules.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.994
First, every day you get here
before everyone else.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.746
- Done.
- Next, power ties only.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.636
Not any of the ties
I have ever seen you wear.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.774
I've been meaning to replace
my entire collection anyway.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.256
Finally, I don't want
a yes-man.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.089
So, I don't care
what the topic is,

09:14.179 --> 09:16.592
if you disagree with me,
I want you to push back

09:16.681 --> 09:18.297
whether it'll piss me off
or not.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.178
Are we clear?

09:20.268 --> 09:23.056
If I say yes to that, that would mean
I'm being a yes-man,

09:23.146 --> 09:24.586
so I don't know
what to do right now.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.559
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.929
You're gonna help me
win the case

09:27.984 --> 09:29.270
that's gonna put us
on the map.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.491
Hey. Do you have a second?

09:38.036 --> 09:40.574
Only if you have an hour
to go through that box over there.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.865
Actually, I think I may have
a better way to spend my time.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.244
Okay.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.687
What's going on
in that brain of yours?

09:46.711 --> 09:47.938
I didn't want to say it
in the room,

09:47.962 --> 09:49.762
but I don't think
Eli Gould is the only person

09:49.839 --> 09:51.205
we should be going to
right now.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.340
We need to pay a visit
to Gallo's daughter.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.964
You think she knows something
that can help us.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.590
I don't know what she knows.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.492
But we better find out,
because there's a chance

09:59.516 --> 10:01.098
that Bratton has her
in his pocket.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.176
And who knows what lies
he told to get her there?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.682
You're right.
I'll go right now.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.374
No, no, no. That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.434
It can't be you.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.268
Donna, I know you're a part of
the firm's leadership, but...

10:11.361 --> 10:13.978
Harvey, if Bratton has convinced her
of some bullshit,

10:14.072 --> 10:16.314
then it's gonna be next to impossible
to change her mind.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.990
And the man who put her father away
in the first place

10:19.077 --> 10:20.284
isn't the one to do that.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.036
You're right.
Do what you can.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.876
Oh, finally.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.589
- I've been looking for you.
- Why?

10:34.676 --> 10:35.962
You got another lawsuit
to drop?

10:36.052 --> 10:37.964
Actually, I have
a settlement to reach.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.699
Are they putting
something in this coffee?

10:40.723 --> 10:42.118
Because it sounds
like you're backing off.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.974
Alex, Robert doesn't want
either one of us

10:44.060 --> 10:45.596
losing any more
business right now.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.040
You mean, you asked him to make me
drop Gavin, and he said no.

10:48.064 --> 10:51.228
The important thing is keeping
both clients wasn't a request.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.478
It was an order.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.969
Which means we need to figure out
a way to stay out of court.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.315
- We do.
- Well...

10:57.157 --> 10:59.385
I'm not selling out my client
just to please Robert Zane,

10:59.409 --> 11:01.366
so what exactly
are you suggesting?

11:01.452 --> 11:04.069
I'm suggesting that we do what
two people that like to go to war

11:04.164 --> 11:07.157
sometimes have to do.
Find a way to make peace.

11:12.714 --> 11:13.750
Eli.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.290
I hope you don't mind,
your wife let me in.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.420
Louis Litt.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.422
You've got some balls
coming to my house.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.656
I knew you might not like it,

11:20.680 --> 11:22.000
which is why
I brought you a gift.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.466
Is that what I think it is?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.246
If you think it's the only copy
of the recording

11:27.270 --> 11:29.470
Alex Williams made of you
that night, then, yeah, it is.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.272
- And I'm offering it to you.
- Why would you do that?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.253
I thought we could work out
a little arrangement.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.735
You get Tommy Bratton
to back off his lawsuit,

11:36.821 --> 11:39.279
you get back the one thing
that can cost you your license.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.358
What makes you think I'd help you
just to get that damn thing back?

11:42.452 --> 11:44.660
Eli, I don't think you fully
understand the situation.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.455
We may have forced him out,
but his name is still on your wall.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.625
You take this to court,
you're risking the name Bratton Gould

11:51.711 --> 11:53.751
forever being associated
with corruption and murder.

11:53.838 --> 11:57.673
And when he convinces a jury that you
fabricated material just to blackmail him,

11:57.759 --> 11:59.500
the whole world's gonna think
you're liars.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.677
That little tape of yours
will be worthless,

12:01.763 --> 12:04.130
and the name Bratton Gould
will be just fine.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.341
Eli, you need
to think this through.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.802
- The man is guilty.
- The man was my partner.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.933
You cost him millions,

12:12.023 --> 12:14.731
blackmailed me twice
with that thing already,

12:14.817 --> 12:16.729
and now you're gonna pay.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.274
- Eli, please.
- Get the hell out of my house.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.418
This is a bunch of bullshit.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.065
I take it that means
you're up to speed?

12:37.131 --> 12:39.491
I'm not just up to speed,
I know more about women's clothing

12:39.550 --> 12:40.916
than I ever thought possible.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.424
Then you know Hi-Rise Fashion
has been ripping off our client's designs.

12:44.514 --> 12:48.007
I do. The thing I don't know
is how we're gonna stop them,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.639
because copyright laws
are notoriously vague.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.937
Which is why, when we win,
it's going to make a statement.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.099
Then since I'm not supposed
to be a yes-man,

12:57.193 --> 12:59.171
I have to ask, are you sure
you don't want our first case

12:59.195 --> 13:00.731
to be a guaranteed win?

13:02.573 --> 13:05.611
Okay, the truth is I'm not just doing this
to make a statement.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.115
I'm also doing it
because the designer's my friend.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.411
Which means
this case is personal.

13:10.498 --> 13:14.788
And I told myself that when I had
enough clout to pick my cases,

13:14.877 --> 13:16.243
I would pick hers.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.950
In that case, why don't you tell me
what our first move is?

13:20.758 --> 13:21.839
Easy.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.134
Tomorrow morning
we slap them with this.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.900
- Denise Gallo?
- Yeah?

13:46.993 --> 13:49.827
My name's Donna Paulsen.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

13:49.912 --> 13:50.948
About what?

13:51.039 --> 13:52.975
I was wondering if a man
named Thomas Bratton came to you

13:52.999 --> 13:55.082
asking about the money
you received from your father.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.626
He came to me to ask
about the money I got from you.

13:57.712 --> 13:58.793
And what'd you tell him?

13:58.880 --> 14:01.497
That I don't know what my father did
to get that money,

14:01.591 --> 14:03.485
but a man came to my home
and dropped off a check,

14:03.509 --> 14:05.000
and I wasn't about
to turn it down.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.814
And didn't that man also tell you
that your father was a good person?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.175
So what if he did?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.756
So these people
are trying to say

14:10.850 --> 14:12.716
that we paid him off
to lie for us.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.926
And it isn't true.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.391
What do you want me
to do about it?

14:16.814 --> 14:18.897
I want you to take the stand
and testify.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.567
Your father died
trying to redeem himself.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.645
They're trying to take that away from you,
and you can't let them do it.

14:24.739 --> 14:28.358
Let's say I believe you,
and Frank actually had changed.

14:29.077 --> 14:32.241
Thomas Bratton told me the reason
he got killed is 'cause of you.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.446
Are you gonna tell me
that's not true?

14:35.917 --> 14:36.998
No.

14:37.835 --> 14:38.996
I'm not.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.625
Because they might
lie to you, but I won't.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.463
Frank never would have
tried to redeem himself

14:46.552 --> 14:47.759
if we hadn't contacted him.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.802
So, yeah,
he might still be alive.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.358
But the reason he's dead
isn't because of us.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.724
It's because they killed him.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.684
Well, it doesn't matter.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.850
'Cause I never knew
the man he became.

14:59.482 --> 15:03.396
I only knew the man he was,
and that man would've lied, cheated,

15:03.486 --> 15:05.443
done whatever else it took
to get what he wanted,

15:05.530 --> 15:07.362
which, most of the time,
was money.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.314
If you ask me
about that under oath,

15:09.409 --> 15:10.866
that's all
I'll be able to say.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.940
All right, Louis, we're all here.
What's going on?

15:22.964 --> 15:24.250
It didn't work with Gould.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.423
And I hate to pile on
more bad news,

15:26.509 --> 15:28.421
but if Bratton puts
Denise Gallo on the stand,

15:28.511 --> 15:30.218
she's gonna say
that Frank Gallo

15:30.304 --> 15:31.657
never did a thing
that wasn't for money.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.718
Which makes it look like
we paid him off to lie.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.120
And if we did that, we'd also be willing
to conspire with each other.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.181
Which means we're right back
at square one.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.478
I wouldn't say that.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.266
- What are you doing here, Eli?
- I'm here with an offer.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.442
Give me that tape back,
I'll get him to settle.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.192
Five million, and you two
admit what you did.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.399
- No deal.
- It saves you money.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.235
It also puts us in a position
of losing our licenses.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.911
Which is what he's been holding
over my head for two years.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.785
I don't give a shit.
No deal.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.959
Look, I thought about
what you said last night

16:02.044 --> 16:05.082
but if I'm gonna convince Tommy,
I got to give him something.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.665
Sign a civil admission,
and we'll seal it.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.670
Sealed or not,
we sign something like that,

16:09.760 --> 16:11.001
it finds its way to the Bar.

16:11.721 --> 16:12.928
Listen to me.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.932
I want this to go away as much as you,
but I'm telling you,

16:17.560 --> 16:19.267
this is the best
you're gonna get.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.395
I hate to say this, but,

16:26.486 --> 16:28.478
I think maybe
we should take his deal.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.567
We can't trust Eli Gould.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.694
And we sure as hell
can't trust Tommy Bratton.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.305
And I think you're forgetting that they
may be lying about the Gallo part,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.571
- but you and Robert did what they're saying.
- So what?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.392
So we may have no other choice
than to trust him.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.748
I'm not
trusting shit.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.250
Because I know
what's going on here.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.815
And it goes back
to Donna's original question.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.439
You mean, why would a man
like Tommy Bratton risk going to prison?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.421
And the answer
is he wouldn't.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.254
This whole thing
is a good-cop-bad-cop bluff,

16:54.347 --> 16:55.554
and I'm gonna
put a stop to it.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.676
How?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.473
The way you put a stop
to any bully.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.636
You take his bluff,
and you shove it down his throat.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.236
Those are lovely.
Whose are they?

17:11.821 --> 17:14.064
- I'm sorry?
- She means, "Who designed them?"

17:14.157 --> 17:15.490
Since we know
your people didn't.

17:15.576 --> 17:20.241
Just like they didn't design
this or this or this.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.617
I don't know
who you are,

17:21.707 --> 17:24.040
but these items were all part
of our last spring line,

17:24.126 --> 17:25.583
and we designed them
ourselves.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.458
What you mean is you copied
my client's designs,

17:28.548 --> 17:30.631
then beat her to market
and undercut her price.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.676
I see what this is
because I've seen it before.

17:34.762 --> 17:38.551
And no associate at some middling
law firm is going to shake me down.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.974
I'm not an associate,
I'm a senior partner.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.140
And this isn't a shakedown,

17:42.186 --> 17:45.224
it's a chance at a settlement
before we clean you out in court.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.101
Then file your suit.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.775
Because it's a thin line
between theft and inspiration,

17:50.861 --> 17:52.221
particularly
in a creative industry

17:52.280 --> 17:54.693
where people have
similar ideas all the time.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.569
My lawyers
have assured me of that.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.777
Have they also told you about
<i>Johnson v. Olympia Records?</i>

17:59.870 --> 18:02.408
Because a songwriter
was awarded $15 million

18:02.498 --> 18:04.865
for plagiarized work
in exactly the same situation.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.246
And since precedents
can cross industries,

18:07.336 --> 18:09.248
in particular
the creative ones...

18:09.338 --> 18:13.082
We thought $15 million for
our client's designs would be fair.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.633
We'll give you 24 hours
to consult your lawyers.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.878
After that,
we'll see you in court.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.139
As your lawyers, it is our job
to go to war for you.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.970
Most of the time
that means going to court.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.273
The thing is, court is ugly, expensive,
and most of all, it's risky.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.318
So last night Samantha and I came up
with a way to avoid all that.

18:33.404 --> 18:37.023
The painting in question had a
market value of $120 million.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.984
Our proposal is that
Starboard Airlines pay 45%,

18:40.077 --> 18:41.318
with no admission of fault.

18:41.996 --> 18:45.285
Let me get this straight.
You want me to pony up $50 million

18:45.374 --> 18:46.518
when we didn't
do anything wrong?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.854
Gavin, it's a compromise.
There's got to be pain on both sides.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.712
Well, I say that's a lot of pain on mine
and not enough on theirs.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.289
And you've got exposure
for the full 120,

18:54.383 --> 18:55.777
so I'd say you're getting
a hell of a deal.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.195
Well, I don't really care
what you say.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.255
Then I'll say it.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.212
If anybody's coming out ahead here,
it's you,

19:00.306 --> 19:01.342
and I don't like it.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.327
- Nina, listen to me.
- No, I did listen to you.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.370
Two days ago, when you said
this shady son of a bitch

19:05.394 --> 19:07.456
destroyed that painting
intentionally and you'd prove it.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.517
- I don't believe it.
- "Shady son of a bitch."

19:09.607 --> 19:11.376
Is that how you talk
about your former clients?

19:11.400 --> 19:12.982
- Gavin...
- Yeah, that's what she said.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.106
Nina, this deal
puts money on the table now.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.232
You don't take it,

19:16.322 --> 19:18.175
I will appeal this thing till 2020
and not break a sweat.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.942
Assuming we don't get it tossed,
which we will,

19:21.035 --> 19:23.994
knowing what I do about how you
and your company do business.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.571
About how I do business?

19:26.123 --> 19:27.803
You gonna let him
push us around like that?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.709
Alex, this thing is a loser for you.
Get your client under control.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.105
Don't tell me
how to handle my client

19:32.129 --> 19:33.440
when you started
this whole thing.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.464
And don't talk to me
about this case being a loser.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.308
- You're lucky we're even in here.
- Bullshit.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.504
You're lucky we're in here.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.426
We go to court,
and I will clean your clock.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.879
- Bring it on.
- If only we could.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.338
As far as I'm concerned,
you can,

19:43.432 --> 19:44.618
'cause I've had
enough of this.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.599
You want my money, Samantha,
come and take it,

19:46.686 --> 19:49.019
'cause I'm not signing
any deals with anyone.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.968
- Harvey, can I talk to you for a second?
- What about?

20:01.992 --> 20:04.096
About the fact that I've had it
with Samantha Wheeler's bullshit.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.452
Slow down.
What's going on?

20:05.538 --> 20:06.949
What's going on
is she deliberately

20:07.039 --> 20:08.905
encouraged Dexhart Insurance
to sue my client,

20:09.041 --> 20:11.441
- and I'm tired of tiptoeing around the situation.
- Meaning?

20:11.502 --> 20:13.063
I want to go
toe-to-toe with her in trial.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.374
You want us to go to trial
representing both clients?

20:15.464 --> 20:17.547
Harvey, I was in a room
with all sides today.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.914
They want a fight as much as I do.
They'll waive conflict.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.009
And that would work, Alex,

20:21.095 --> 20:23.007
except we can't afford
having two partners

20:23.097 --> 20:24.950
fighting a death match
in front of the whole world,

20:24.974 --> 20:27.466
when we need to look unified.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.246
What do you mean when we need
to look unified?

20:29.270 --> 20:30.727
What's going on?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.666
I don't want to get into it,
but we're handling it.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.584
Well, here's the thing, Harvey,
we're not unified.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.146
And even if we were,
those two clients aren't going to settle.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.353
So, like it or not,
my next move is going to court

20:39.447 --> 20:41.279
to get her
kicked off this case.

20:46.996 --> 20:50.080
Samantha, if you're here about your case
against Starboard Airlines...

20:50.166 --> 20:52.704
- You know about that?
- I'm a name partner.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.911
It's my business to know when one
of our attorneys files suit against another.

20:56.005 --> 20:59.005
Well, while we're on the subject
of filing things, Alex Williams filed this.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.446
This is a motion to force you
to recuse yourself.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.364
Yeah, he's trying to get me
kicked off my own case,

21:04.388 --> 21:06.116
which means you're gonna
kick him off instead.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.132
- Wait, what?
- You heard me.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.369
Alex is gonna
drop Gavin Andrews,

21:09.393 --> 21:10.537
and you're gonna
make him do it.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.122
No. You want that done,
you go to Robert.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.623
Robert's not here,
and I need it done now.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.750
Well, I can't do it for you.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.107
You can and you will
because you owe me.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.171
Oh, no. You don't get
to call in that chit for this.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.562
I get to call it in
for whatever I want,

21:21.655 --> 21:24.318
because you came to me
and made me drop Delta,

21:24.408 --> 21:28.152
and then I went against Robert when you
wanted back on the case he took from you.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.454
So we are dropping Gavin Andrews
whether you like it or not.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.960
You come
here for the steam?

21:45.054 --> 21:46.545
Because I hate
to break it to you,

21:46.639 --> 21:47.880
you got to take
the suit off.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.305
That's a good one, Tommy.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.973
But I'm here
to tell you I don't care

21:51.060 --> 21:55.179
if you get Eli Gould or Mother Teresa
or Gandhi to be your good cop,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.459
- we're not taking your deal.
- I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.440
- I didn't offer you a deal.
- Oh, yes, you did.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.894
Because you don't have
the balls to risk going to prison.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.827
That's funny, because
what are you going to say

22:03.864 --> 22:06.607
when I put you on the stand
and I ask you point-blank,

22:06.700 --> 22:09.317
did you conspire
with Harvey Specter?

22:09.411 --> 22:12.074
You talk a big game,
but it's not going down like that,

22:12.164 --> 22:14.907
because I'm gonna say that you conspired
to keep people in prison

22:15.000 --> 22:16.603
for the purpose
of lining your own pockets.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.493
And when you
end up in prison yourself,

22:18.587 --> 22:21.295
every inmate in there is gonna know
that's exactly what you did.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.710
- Now who's talking a big game, Robert?
- I am.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.882
Because we're gonna show
this video of Frank Gallo calling you out.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.180
Hell, we might even
put it up on YouTube.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.054
You're making
a big mistake, Robert.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.635
I'm calling your bluff.
So drop this thing,

22:36.230 --> 22:38.347
or go ahead
and pick a trial date.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.022
But, Tommy,
just to be clear,

22:40.109 --> 22:41.771
when they close
that cell door,

22:42.528 --> 22:44.315
you're not gonna
last the night.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.994
Harvey,
we need to talk.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.183
If it's about Robert and Bratton,
I haven't heard back yet.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.290
It's not.
It's about Alex and Samantha.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.868
- What did he do now?
- Not him, it's her.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.999
She wants me to make him
drop Gavin Andrews.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.900
Well, then what the hell
are you doing in here?

23:03.924 --> 23:05.040
Just tell her no.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.375
Here's the thing, Harvey.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.551
I gave her a chit.
I owe her.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.629
She knows it, and now
I don't know what to do.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.805
- Alex was right.
- What do you mean?

23:12.892 --> 23:15.179
I mean, I've had about enough
of Samantha's bullshit.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.206
So you're saying I should sacrifice my honor
and not let her cash in her chit?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.847
No, Louis. I'm saying
the complete opposite.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.985
Katrina, we've been
going over this all day.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.070
We've got them.
They're gonna take the deal.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.200
Maybe they will,

23:36.290 --> 23:39.408
but I am going to keep dotting my Is
and crossing my Ts

23:39.501 --> 23:40.541
because I need to be sure.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.291
What you need is for someone
not to be your yes-man,

23:43.380 --> 23:45.087
- and that starts right now.
- Brian...

23:45.174 --> 23:47.632
Katrina, you just became
senior partner.

23:47.718 --> 23:50.426
I bet you haven't even
taken time to celebrate yet.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.671
- I'll celebrate after we win.
- No, you won't...

23:52.765 --> 23:54.576
Because there'll be
another case and then another.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.886
And if you don't stop

23:55.976 --> 23:58.468
and appreciate the big moments
when they come,

23:58.938 --> 24:00.429
you'll regret it.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.899
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I'm pulling rank.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.728
We're going out to celebrate,
and we're going out right now.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.994
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

24:17.081 --> 24:18.447
Whoa, Alex, calm down.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.894
You told my client we're dropping him
and you want me to calm down?

24:20.918 --> 24:22.687
You're lucky I'm not putting you
on the floor right now.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.294
Listen to me. I had to do it.
It was the only way.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.665
- The only way to what? Screw me over?
- Alex, I owed Samantha.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.029
The only way for me to get out
of it was to do this for her.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.386
- So you put her over me.
- No, I didn't.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.179
Because if she wasn't
asking for this,

24:35.265 --> 24:37.973
she'd be asking me to back her
for name partner when the time comes,

24:38.060 --> 24:40.598
instead of me and Harvey backing you
for name partner right now.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.124
You're telling me I'm name partner?
Because I didn't get the memo.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.417
Harvey's going
to Zane as we speak.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.461
Well, Louis, the second you put
my name on the door,

24:46.485 --> 24:48.693
I will call Gavin and drop him
like a hot potato.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.315
Until then,
he's my client,

24:50.406 --> 24:52.687
and don't you ever contact him
without my knowledge again.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.792
To Z.S.L.'s
newest senior partner.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.314
Brian, you've already
toasted me four times.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.581
I'd figured you're new
to this whole celebrating thing.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.257
I wanted to show you
how it's done.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.507
Well, in that case...

25:14.596 --> 25:16.713
To Z.S.L.'s best associate,

25:16.807 --> 25:20.016
because, Brian, that precedent
was a stroke of genius.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.264
Thank you.

25:25.274 --> 25:28.142
By the way,
how did you come up with it?

25:28.235 --> 25:30.397
The music industry
is the perfect parallel,

25:30.487 --> 25:32.007
and yet no one's ever
thought of it before.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.148
It's actually
a little embarrassing.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.607
What do you mean
embarrassing?

25:36.452 --> 25:37.988
I thought
about the music industry

25:38.078 --> 25:41.913
because I considered
becoming a songwriter myself.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.786
- You're kidding.
- No.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.289
In fact, Julie and I
talked about it a long time

25:46.378 --> 25:48.461
before finally
deciding on law school.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.708
Let me guess.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.881
She wanted you
to take the safer route,

25:51.967 --> 25:54.584
and you wanted
to explore your artistic side.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.089
Actually,
the other way around.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.554
When I told her
I was going to be a lawyer,

25:58.640 --> 26:02.133
she said I should have more faith
in myself as an artist.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.391
You're lucky to have someone
who thinks so highly of you.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.517
I am.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.314
But the thing is,
once I moved into law,

26:08.400 --> 26:11.438
I found I loved it as much as I ever
loved writing.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.239
- What?
- Nothing. It's just...

26:18.452 --> 26:19.909
Julie doesn't
understand that,

26:19.995 --> 26:21.611
and sometimes
I wish she would.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.782
Anyway, it's nice to be able
to talk about the law

26:25.876 --> 26:27.436
with someone
that's actually interested.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.606
Well, if that's
what you're looking for,

26:29.630 --> 26:32.464
consider me happy to discuss
the nuances of the law anytime,

26:32.549 --> 26:34.165
because I love it
as much as you do.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.177
Thank you for tonight, Brian.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.798
This is exactly
what I needed.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.476
Thanks for asking me
to be your associate, Katrina.

26:45.562 --> 26:46.803
I'm really happy you did.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.852
Oh, Harvey. Good.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.738
You can help me go through
the last of these files.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.176
I'm not going
through anything, Robert.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.157
Not until we've talked
about Alex Williams.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.907
If this is about what I think it is,
we already talked about it.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.613
No, we agreed to kick
the can down the road.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.164
Well, this is the end
of the road,

27:07.251 --> 27:09.538
because Louis and I
are backing Alex

27:09.628 --> 27:10.835
for name partner right now.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.163
Harvey, now is not the time
to be discussing this.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.293
Yes, it is,

27:14.383 --> 27:17.046
because Samantha and Alex
are about to go to war.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.049
If you're talking about Dexhart Insurance,
I told her to settle.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.425
Well, she didn't.

27:21.515 --> 27:24.724
She went to Louis, called in a chit
to make him drop Gavin Andrews.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.642
And I didn't let you
become managing partner

27:26.770 --> 27:29.353
- just so your lieutenant...
- You didn't let me do anything.

27:29.439 --> 27:32.728
- And if Samantha did that, I'll deal with her.
- How?

27:32.818 --> 27:35.276
Because as far as I can tell,
you have never dealt with her.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.319
- Okay, you listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

27:37.406 --> 27:40.023
You've let her do whatever she wants
ever since she got here.

27:40.117 --> 27:43.030
Alex has been fighting for this firm
ever since he got here.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.236
And I made him a promise...

27:44.329 --> 27:46.489
Before you two go any further,
we got a bigger problem.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.581
Tommy Bratton
wasn't bluffing.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.979
He just sent over a trial date.
It's for a week from today.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.414
- Shit.
- Exactly.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.898
So you two need to
stop fighting each other

27:53.922 --> 27:55.900
- because now we got to fight him.
- No, we don't.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.695
- Because I know why Bratton's doing this.
- What are you talking about?

27:58.719 --> 28:00.738
You thought Bratton wouldn't risk
going to prison for this.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.675
Well, he will,
and I know why.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.330
I don't know about you,

28:09.354 --> 28:12.392
but getting here at 7:00 a.m. isn't
as easy with a hangover.

28:12.482 --> 28:13.893
I don't care, Brian,

28:13.984 --> 28:15.771
because Hi-Rise Fashion
just dropped a bomb.

28:16.403 --> 28:19.487
- Wait, what? How? We've got them.
- In court, yes.

28:19.573 --> 28:22.316
But they just cut a huge deal
with our manufacturer.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.275
And suddenly our manufacturer
is telling us

28:24.369 --> 28:26.656
they no longer have the capacity
to handle our product.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.704
You mean they made it
a condition of their order,

28:28.790 --> 28:30.122
which is illegal.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.166
Yes, it is.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.164
And if they did it to us,
they did it to others.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.608
And I'm going to tell them I'm going to
the DOJ if they don't back off.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.624
No, without proof,
a threat like that

28:38.717 --> 28:41.175
can be construed as inducing
malicious prosecution.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.340
- You can't do it.
- Well, I have to do something.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.230
Because instead
of spending my time last night

28:45.307 --> 28:47.845
thinking about how to prevent this,
I took my eye off the ball.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.892
Katrina, don't be
so hard on yourself.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.220
You couldn't have
seen this coming.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.850
I might have seen it coming

28:53.941 --> 28:55.432
if I'd stayed here
like I wanted to

28:55.525 --> 28:58.393
instead of letting you
convince me to go party.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.358
Hold on a second.
You're saying this is my fault?

29:05.744 --> 29:08.282
Because I didn't convince you,
I invited you.

29:08.372 --> 29:11.080
And you said you wanted
an associate who would push back.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.705
Push back on case work,
not tell me not to do my job.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.788
Then let me push back right now,
because you bluff these guys,

29:17.881 --> 29:20.043
you're opening yourself up
to huge exposure.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.294
So what?

29:21.385 --> 29:22.921
Harvey Specter
bluffs all the time.

29:23.011 --> 29:27.506
Harvey Specter has a 15-plus-year
track record of kicking people's asses.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.994
So you don't have faith in me
to pull this off.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.054
I didn't say that.

29:31.144 --> 29:35.013
I'm saying it's not a risk worth taking,
and I'm not gonna let you do it.

29:35.107 --> 29:39.272
Well, Brian, there's a time to push back
and a time to get in line.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.148
I'm going over there
at 3:00 p.m. today,

29:41.238 --> 29:43.321
and you are either
with me or you're not.

29:43.407 --> 29:47.321
Then I'm not, because this is a mistake,
and you know it.

29:55.544 --> 29:56.876
Harvey, you have a minute?

29:56.962 --> 30:00.205
I'm about to file a few motions,
but, yeah, I have a minute.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.979
I was under the impression you don't
normally file your own motions.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.296
Well, it's kind of important.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.220
What's on your mind?
Trouble in senior partner town?

30:07.306 --> 30:08.467
How'd you know?

30:08.557 --> 30:10.118
Because that's
the first thing that happens

30:10.142 --> 30:11.804
after you make it
to senior partner town.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.269
Well, then long story short...

30:16.023 --> 30:17.855
It's my first case...

30:17.941 --> 30:20.934
My back's against the wall,
and my only way out is to bluff.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.064
But?

30:22.154 --> 30:24.988
I'm opening myself up
to significant exposure, and...

30:26.199 --> 30:28.065
I'm not sure
I can pull it off.

30:29.578 --> 30:30.989
Then think of another way.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.699
How come?

30:32.789 --> 30:35.657
Because if you're not sure
you can pull it off, you won't.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.743
And, Katrina, life is long.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.374
You don't want to start your
senior partnership with exposure.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.171
Now, I got to go.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.874
Thank you, Harvey.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.846
I see they're letting you
use your old office.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.804
First, Robert, now you?

30:57.898 --> 30:59.514
Well, he had
his turn at bat.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.474
And we thought it was time
for me to have mine.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.231
Oh, go ahead and take your best shot,
but like I told Robert,

31:04.321 --> 31:05.357
I'm not bluffing.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.484
That's the thing, Tommy,
we know you're not,

31:07.574 --> 31:08.690
and we figured out why.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.384
You don't know
what you're talking about.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.197
Yes, I do.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.705
Turns out, three months ago,
you were diagnosed with cancer

31:15.791 --> 31:16.952
and given a year to live.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.626
Well, if you know that, then you
also know I'm never going to settle.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.500
What I know is what our trial
strategy is gonna be.

31:24.508 --> 31:25.715
Motion to delay,

31:26.593 --> 31:27.879
motion to delay,

31:27.969 --> 31:29.301
motion to delay.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.801
The wheels of justice
turn slowly, Tommy,

31:31.890 --> 31:34.257
which means even if you win,
you won't be here to see it.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.388
You really are
a son of a bitch, aren't you?

31:36.478 --> 31:38.094
No. You did this.

31:38.188 --> 31:39.975
You brought this
on yourself.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.431
It's time to let it go.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.983
Spend what time you have left
with your family.

31:44.778 --> 31:47.145
Just let me go back to my firm
for nine months more,

31:47.239 --> 31:48.480
and I will drop this.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.314
I can't let
you do that, Tommy,

31:50.409 --> 31:51.866
because I've seen
what you do.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.035
I'm not gonna let you
get back in the game

31:54.121 --> 31:56.329
and do something like this
to someone else.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.162
Then you know what?
Delay all you want.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.869
Because they say when you're
fighting something like I am,

32:02.963 --> 32:04.670
you have to have
something to live for.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.464
Well, you just gave me two years
to live on hate alone.

32:07.551 --> 32:10.510
Now get the hell out of here,
and I'll see you in court.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.228
That looks like a job
for your associate.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.275
If you're just here to talk me
out of my bluff,

32:27.362 --> 32:28.881
you don't have to worry,
I'm not gonna do it.

32:28.905 --> 32:29.941
Good.

32:30.532 --> 32:31.989
Because
you don't have to.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.162
I don't believe it.

32:43.253 --> 32:46.337
You got proof they colluded
with our manufacturer.

32:46.423 --> 32:47.459
I did.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.591
- Brian, how did you get this?
- Simple.

32:50.677 --> 32:54.717
I called up the factory pretending to be
in Hi-Rise's contracts department

32:54.806 --> 32:57.594
and started complaining about how
all we had were verbal assurances

32:57.684 --> 32:59.516
they'd uphold our agreement.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.141
Eventually they agreed
to sign a memo.

33:02.272 --> 33:04.980
- They agreed to incriminate themselves?
- Not exactly.

33:05.066 --> 33:08.480
I told them copyright laws
are notoriously vague,

33:08.570 --> 33:10.311
so their memo could be, too.

33:10.405 --> 33:14.149
But even a vague memo is enough
for us to get them investigated.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.323
Or threaten to.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.277
But now,

33:17.871 --> 33:19.203
you can do it with proof.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.542
Did it occur to you that
misrepresenting yourself like this

33:24.628 --> 33:26.665
could have opened you up
to huge exposure?

33:26.755 --> 33:27.962
It did.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.547
But I decided
it was worth the risk,

33:30.634 --> 33:33.297
because my job
may be to push back,

33:33.386 --> 33:35.548
but it's also
to have your back.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.259
And from now on, I will.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.846
"Two more years
on hate alone."

33:46.107 --> 33:47.223
He said that?

33:47.317 --> 33:49.900
He not only said it,
the son of a bitch meant it.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.148
He's gonna fight us
until his last breath.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.529
What?

33:55.116 --> 33:58.200
A man gets told he only has
so much time left on this Earth,

33:58.286 --> 34:00.619
you would think that would
put things in perspective.

34:00.705 --> 34:01.741
You would.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.331
But I guess
he'd have to be human.

34:06.336 --> 34:09.500
And as it turns out,
he's more like the Terminator,

34:09.589 --> 34:10.955
just won't go down.

34:11.757 --> 34:14.592
Come with me if you want to live.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.237
I'll be back.

34:16.763 --> 34:20.427
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.600
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.163
First of all, that's <i>Predator.</i>

34:24.187 --> 34:26.929
Second of all, you sound
Jamaican, not German.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.481
Oh. Oh, man, get off my back, man.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.605
You know what?
He's Austrian.

34:33.780 --> 34:34.860
Yeah.

34:39.119 --> 34:40.451
What are we gonna do?

34:41.329 --> 34:43.241
We're gonna do
what we have to.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.368
Just delay this thing
as long as possible

34:45.458 --> 34:46.869
and then fight it
on its merits.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.800
We don't have
to fight anything anymore.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.245
Tommy Bratton's dead.

34:52.632 --> 34:55.090
- What?
- Eli Gould just called.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.882
Said Tommy
had a heart attack.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.884
They think it was brought on
by the stress of fighting his illness.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.840
And fighting us.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.219
Anyway, for what
it's worth,

35:06.313 --> 35:07.804
Gould's dropping
the whole thing.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.516
I got to say, I always thought
we'd win, but not like this.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.435
Robert, you okay?

35:16.031 --> 35:17.192
I don't know.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.200
We may have
been at war, but...

35:22.829 --> 35:24.695
I knew the man
for 30 years.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.959
I could use a minute
to process this.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.130
You take
all the time you need.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.023
How'd it go?

35:56.738 --> 35:59.651
- I didn't know you liked baseball.
- I didn't know you liked music.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.525
- You heading home for the night?
- Yeah.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.179
- Actually, I have to...
- Don't go yet.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.656
Brian, you came through for me
in every way on this case.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.284
And like you said
the other night,

36:11.378 --> 36:13.461
if we don't stop to celebrate
the little things,

36:13.546 --> 36:15.162
then what's any of this for?

36:15.965 --> 36:18.924
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say this is your way of thanking me

36:19.761 --> 36:20.968
for looking out for you.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.090
It is.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.422
And I happen
to have made us reservations

36:24.516 --> 36:26.508
at an amazing place
with live music

36:26.601 --> 36:28.217
in honor of your
love of music...

36:28.311 --> 36:29.518
Katrina, I can't tonight.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.976
I really need to get home
to Julie and the baby.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.398
Oh.

36:34.484 --> 36:36.316
The baby, of course.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.269
I'm sorry.
I didn't think about it.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.695
No, it's okay.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.801
If you don't have one,
why would you think about it?

36:41.825 --> 36:43.465
Right.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.948
Let me just say that I would love
to get a rain check.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.457
- Rain check it is.
- In the meantime, I got to go.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.628
I'm sure you have someone else
who would love to take my place.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.751
Oh, of course.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.836
Have a good night, Brian.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.756
Good night, Katrina.

37:09.644 --> 37:10.930
Am I interrupting?

37:11.020 --> 37:12.511
- Not really.
- Good.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.848
Because I happen to have walked in
on a conversation last night

37:15.942 --> 37:17.586
that made me want
to have a conversation with you.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.021
I'm listening.

37:19.112 --> 37:20.728
This...

37:20.822 --> 37:23.906
Thing between you and Alex
is coming to a head,

37:23.992 --> 37:26.484
because Harvey and Louis
want Alex to be the next name partner

37:26.578 --> 37:28.194
and Robert doesn't.

37:28.288 --> 37:30.325
Skip the preamble, Donna.
What's on your mind?

37:30.832 --> 37:32.601
I don't suppose
it would do any good to ask you

37:32.625 --> 37:34.958
to let this thing go
and let Alex go up there first.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.484
- I don't believe it.
- Believe what?

37:36.546 --> 37:39.150
That Harvey doesn't have the balls
to come in here and ask me that himself

37:39.174 --> 37:40.210
instead, he sent you.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.383
He didn't send anybody.
I'm here on my own.

37:42.469 --> 37:44.530
Well, then you may have internalized
the patriarchal system here,

37:44.554 --> 37:45.715
but I have not.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.717
I haven't
internalized anything.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.844
I told you, I'm not here
at the behest of any man.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.426
I'm here on my own,
woman-to-woman,

37:52.520 --> 37:54.682
asking you to take
the long view and wait.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.389
I'm sure you think
that's true, Donna,

37:56.483 --> 37:59.476
but did it occur to you to ask Alex
to step down before you came to me?

37:59.569 --> 38:02.186
Because that's what I mean
by patriarchy.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.694
Well, I did thing to ask Alex,
and I chose to ask you.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.741
And I did that
because it comes down

38:07.827 --> 38:10.114
to who the promise
was made to first,

38:10.205 --> 38:12.367
not the gender of the person
it was made to.

38:12.457 --> 38:15.575
And what's to stop them from changing
their minds before it's my turn?

38:15.668 --> 38:17.605
Because they're not gonna
put a second name up there

38:17.629 --> 38:18.915
for at least another year.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.418
What if they
put it in writing?

38:23.510 --> 38:25.376
You're a lawyer,
you make it airtight.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.574
You really make
a person get to the bottom

38:28.598 --> 38:30.339
of what's inside
of them, don't you?

38:30.433 --> 38:31.594
What do you mean?

38:31.684 --> 38:33.220
I mean when you put it
that way,

38:33.311 --> 38:34.830
it's not about them
changing their minds

38:34.854 --> 38:37.767
or it taking too long or even
Robert getting hit by a bus.

38:37.857 --> 38:41.396
The truth is,
I'm not backing down because...

38:42.737 --> 38:44.478
I think I'm better
than Alex Williams.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.322
And I'm not going
to say that I'm not.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.784
Then I respect
your decision.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.328
Good night, Samantha.

39:00.380 --> 39:01.416
Hey.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.966
I heard you won
your first case,

39:06.052 --> 39:07.692
and the fact
that I already heard about it

39:07.762 --> 39:09.532
means you're already
making a name for yourself.

39:09.556 --> 39:10.637
So...

39:17.772 --> 39:18.979
Thank you, Louis.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.607
Wait a second.
Is something wrong?

39:22.694 --> 39:24.630
God damn it, did they spell
Bennett with one T again?

39:24.654 --> 39:25.940
No, nothing's wrong.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.943
It's just been a long day,
and I'm tired.

39:32.745 --> 39:35.203
Katrina...
I know you.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.408
You don't get tired after winning a case.
Something is going on.

39:41.337 --> 39:44.671
It's just...
I know I should be happy right now.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.709
I finally made it
to the top of the mountain.

39:47.802 --> 39:48.838
I get it.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.408
It only made you realize
how much further you still want to go.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.847
Yes, that's it.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.970
That's exactly it.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.311
No, it's not it.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.231
I have seen that look before,
and it was on my face.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.398
Katrina,

40:04.819 --> 40:06.355
when it comes
to that part of life,

40:08.197 --> 40:09.404
you can't force it.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.115
It's unpredictable.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.446
- I hate unpredictable.
- I know.

40:16.539 --> 40:17.996
I do, too.

40:18.082 --> 40:22.918
But you once told me that someday,
I would find someone.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.749
And I did.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.376
And you will, too.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.509
Life is gonna put that special someone
right in front of you,

40:30.595 --> 40:33.508
and when it happens,
I know you'll be ready.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.600
Hey, I just realized.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.274
I never took you out
to celebrate your promotion.

40:41.314 --> 40:43.314
What do you say we go out
and get dinner right now?

40:43.358 --> 40:46.601
Another time, Louis.
I have some work to catch up on.

40:46.694 --> 40:53.442
<i>I don't wanna run
Leave you talking to yourself</i>

40:53.534 --> 41:00.031
<i>Close your eyes
And you feel like somebody else</i>

41:08.549 --> 41:09.756
Drinking alone?

41:10.802 --> 41:12.543
I guess
what they say is true.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.546
None of us know
how much time we really have.

41:16.099 --> 41:17.215
No, we don't.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.218
Listen, Robert,
I've been doing some thinking

41:20.311 --> 41:22.303
about the Samantha
and Alex situation.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.104
- Not tonight.
- Just hear me out.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.226
Please.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.277
I think we should
let them fight.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.357
Harvey, we do that,
we're admitting our house is divided,

41:34.450 --> 41:36.112
and we make it
that much easier

41:36.202 --> 41:39.320
for another Tommy Bratton
to try and pick us apart.

41:39.414 --> 41:40.450
I know.

41:41.290 --> 41:42.747
But our house is divided.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.877
I made a promise,
you made a promise.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.295
And if we keep
doing nothing...

41:48.381 --> 41:50.589
It's worse than letting them
settle it themselves.

41:52.218 --> 41:56.053
One case, head-to-head,
winner gets name partner.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.464
You think they'll go for it?

41:58.558 --> 42:01.676
I think they've been wanting to go
at it ever since you two got here.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.890
Then I say we let them fight.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.648
You want to tell them,
or should I?

42:12.196 --> 42:13.528
Why don't we both tell them?

42:14.073 --> 42:15.689
But let's do it tomorrow.

42:15.783 --> 42:19.197
Because after today, all I want to do
is finish this drink,

42:19.829 --> 42:21.161
go home, and...

42:22.373 --> 42:23.489
See Laura.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.540
Good night, Robert.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.510
Goodnight, Harvey.
