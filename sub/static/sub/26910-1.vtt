[elder Mosi] Have you
ever wondered why the sun

00:16.375 --> 00:19.458
and the moon never shine
in the sky together?

00:20.958 --> 00:22.625
Long ago,

00:23.708 --> 00:25.375
they were husband and wife.

00:26.333 --> 00:30.417
Their love lit up the sky
like never before.

00:32.292 --> 00:33.292
But,

00:33.667 --> 00:36.125
But the moon became jealous
of the attention

00:36.167 --> 00:38.708
the sun gave to the universe.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.292
She was so heartbroken

00:42.125 --> 00:43.875
that she wanted nothing
to do with him.

00:45.458 --> 00:49.042
Kisiwa Island was split
into the Sun Village

00:49.125 --> 00:50.833
and the Moon Kingdom.

00:51.625 --> 00:53.958
Plants could not grow
without the sun.

00:54.875 --> 00:56.167
To stop the hunger,

00:57.083 --> 00:59.125
the moon sent animals.

01:00.208 --> 01:02.000
But the people
were still depressed

01:02.042 --> 01:03.167
without the sun.

01:03.583 --> 01:07.833
So she lavished them
with diamonds, rubies

01:08.417 --> 01:09.542
and lots of gold!

01:10.667 --> 01:14.083
Everybody lived by
the monarchy's number one rule:

01:14.500 --> 01:16.458
par-tay!

01:17.417 --> 01:20.292
Meanwhile, on the other side
of the island...

01:21.042 --> 01:22.958
The land was fertile.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.917
But without the moon,

01:27.875 --> 01:30.333
people worked non-stop.

01:31.917 --> 01:35.208
A council of wise elders
lead the village.

01:35.250 --> 01:36.875
Both sides of the island

01:37.708 --> 01:39.583
were like different planets

01:40.083 --> 01:41.667
until one girl

01:42.417 --> 01:45.542
changed the sky as we know it...

01:47.042 --> 01:49.167
[mama] I gotta take Grandma
to the doctor,

01:49.458 --> 01:51.875
help Aunt Imani
plan her baby shower,

01:51.875 --> 01:53.625
and stop by the market...

01:54.167 --> 01:56.083
You mind watching Kojo and Ayo?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.500
-[Kojo] Gimme!
-[Ayo] Gimme!

01:58.042 --> 01:59.375
[Dafina] Do I have a choice?

02:00.083 --> 02:02.083
Dafina, when I was your age,

02:02.375 --> 02:04.833
I had to look after
seven younger brothers.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.292
I know, Mama.

02:06.958 --> 02:10.083
But... why do girls
always have to baby-sit?

02:10.833 --> 02:12.583
That's the way it was for me,

02:13.042 --> 02:14.958
your grandmother,
your great-grand--

02:14.958 --> 02:17.750
-[Ayo farts]
-[Kojo cries]

02:18.000 --> 02:20.333
[laughs] Come here,
Little Miss Stinky.

02:21.667 --> 02:23.792
It's okay. I'll change her.

02:25.333 --> 02:26.583
Thanks, sweetheart.

02:28.375 --> 02:31.375
[slurps]

02:37.667 --> 02:39.000
[Kojo] Yummy! Yummy!

02:39.250 --> 02:40.792
[Ayo] Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!

02:41.000 --> 02:44.167
[Kojo and Aya laugh]

02:48.625 --> 02:49.875
[sighs]

02:50.667 --> 02:52.208
[baba] Good morning,
my children!

02:52.375 --> 02:53.375
[Omari] What's up!

02:53.500 --> 02:55.208
Hey, Baba. Hey, Omari.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.750
Mama made grits.

02:57.542 --> 02:58.750
Mmmm!

02:59.583 --> 03:01.208
No time for breakfast today.

03:01.542 --> 03:02.542
Aww!

03:03.417 --> 03:05.542
We're starting
a very important project.

03:05.958 --> 03:08.125
Oh! The princess stool?

03:10.292 --> 03:11.292
Wow!

03:11.500 --> 03:12.667
Remember,

03:12.708 --> 03:16.167
who it's for is never as
important as what it's for.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.208
[Kojo and Ayo laughs]

03:26.167 --> 03:28.000
[babytalk]

03:31.042 --> 03:33.417
Will I be surprised
with a princess stool

03:33.500 --> 03:34.958
for my birthday tomorrow?

[Mosi] Someday,
you'll be one cool mama.

05:39.042 --> 05:40.583
What do you want, Mosi?

05:41.417 --> 05:42.833
Happy birthday, Dafina!

05:43.208 --> 05:45.375
Go 'head, it's your birthday.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.917
Go 'head, it's your birthday.

05:48.542 --> 05:50.375
[laughs] Thanks for remembering.

05:51.292 --> 05:54.292
What kind of guy forgets
his future wife's birthday?

05:55.125 --> 05:56.917
Let's not get carried away.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.667
-[Kojo] Gimme, gimme.
-[Ayo] Gimme, gimme.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.958
The nerve of you to eat
my birthday gift!

06:04.833 --> 06:06.542
No, I... ouch!

06:06.708 --> 06:07.792
[kids laugh]

06:07.833 --> 06:10.000
I thought it might be romantic
to peel you some fruit,

06:10.250 --> 06:12.042
who knew love could
be so painful.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.375
[kids laugh harder]

06:16.125 --> 06:18.708
Friends have no business
being romantic.

06:19.417 --> 06:22.083
We could be much more
than friends.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.292
You never know when to quit.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.042
[chewing loudly]

06:29.917 --> 06:31.833
But I know what women want.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.333
Oh really?

06:37.458 --> 06:39.833
A guy who makes them laugh
till their stomach hurts.

06:40.708 --> 06:43.583
Or maybe that's gas? [laughs]

06:44.875 --> 06:47.000
Know the one about
the cheetah and the giraffe?

06:47.208 --> 06:48.208
[laughs]

06:48.625 --> 06:50.708
[Dafina] You've told that joke
twenty-eight times,

06:51.083 --> 06:53.708
-but who's counting--
-It was a very, very hot day.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.708
And the cheetah went under
the biggest tree for some shade.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.292
Along comes the giraffe
who says,

07:01.292 --> 07:03.083
"Hey, you took my spots."

07:03.458 --> 07:04.875
[crickets chirp]
Get it?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.125
They both have...

07:06.417 --> 07:08.375
[children giggle]

07:09.167 --> 07:11.875
[chuckles] Maybe that joke
is for a younger crowd.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.958
Don't worry, I'll get you
more fruit tomorrow,

07:16.958 --> 07:18.875
and the day after that,
and the day after that,

07:19.250 --> 07:20.833
till we're so old
that our teeth fall out

07:21.083 --> 07:22.750
and we can't eat fruit anymore.

07:23.667 --> 07:27.000
[Mosi pretends to be toothless]

07:27.042 --> 07:29.750
Ugh! That's gross,

07:30.458 --> 07:31.792
but kinda sweet too.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.583
[kissing sound]

07:34.875 --> 07:36.500
[Kojo and Ayo] Oooh.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.542
Thank you so much
for cooking my favorite.

07:48.917 --> 07:51.667
I had to make veggie stew
for my birthday girl.

07:52.042 --> 07:53.417
You didn't forget?

07:53.958 --> 07:57.417
Girl, I was in labor with you
for twenty-two hours! Um!

07:58.167 --> 08:00.208
I remember every second of it.

08:01.042 --> 08:03.917
When the midwife put you
in my arms and you smiled at me,

08:04.042 --> 08:06.875
I thought you were
the most precious thing

08:06.875 --> 08:08.333
under the sun.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.792
[baba] Happy birthday, Dafina!

08:12.083 --> 08:13.958
Your father and I
wanted to give you something

08:13.958 --> 08:16.833
as special
and unique as you are.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.333
Wow! It's really pretty!

08:21.792 --> 08:25.125
These eighteen beads represent
each year of your life.

08:25.625 --> 08:28.958
Let everything you've learned
be a foundation for wisdom.

08:29.625 --> 08:32.042
Thank you so much,
Mama and Baba.

08:39.125 --> 08:42.250
[Nubia] Hey girl, what'd you get
for your birthday?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.708
My father made this for me.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.250
[Sizani] I guess that's cute,

08:48.708 --> 08:50.458
if you like that sort of thing,

08:51.542 --> 08:54.917
but girl, look what my daddy
bought me for my birthday!

08:54.958 --> 08:55.958
[laughs proudly]

08:56.208 --> 08:58.167
Quit showing off, Sizani.

08:58.542 --> 09:01.583
You know her family
can't afford gold. Um.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.458
Oh, my bad.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.000
Besides,
the only gift that counts

09:06.042 --> 09:08.292
is the one
from your boyfriend, right?

09:09.083 --> 09:10.083
Check this out.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.125
See what my man got me
for my birthday!

09:13.542 --> 09:15.917
'Ey, we saw Mosi walking around

09:15.917 --> 09:17.750
with a lil' fruit basket
yesterday.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.208
Is that all he gave you?

09:19.417 --> 09:20.458
[cheetah laughs]

09:21.667 --> 09:23.375
Mosi is not my man.

09:23.958 --> 09:26.250
[giggles smugly]
Don't be ashamed, Dafina.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.875
Some girls get diamonds,
[clears throat]

09:29.042 --> 09:32.542
And some girls get corny guys
with corny jokes.

09:33.083 --> 09:36.250
Nubia, I told you,
he's not my ma--

09:36.667 --> 09:37.667
[Nubia] Hm.

09:38.042 --> 09:39.375
[Sizani] Bye Dafina!

09:39.958 --> 09:41.583
Come on, girl,
let's go to the market.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.917
I need new sandals
in the worst way.

09:43.958 --> 09:44.958
Ouch!

09:45.000 --> 09:47.375
[monkey laughs]

09:48.167 --> 09:49.792
Girl, what's the matter?

09:50.042 --> 09:52.583
That's exactly
what Mosi gave you.

09:53.708 --> 09:56.708
[laughs wickedly]

09:56.833 --> 09:59.000
He even kinda looks like Mosi.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.125
[cheetah mouth farts]

10:02.167 --> 10:03.208
[Sizani] Aw, look at him!

10:04.750 --> 10:05.750
Mosi!

10:05.917 --> 10:08.667
[Dafina cries]

10:15.833 --> 10:17.333
What's wrong, sweetheart?

10:21.125 --> 10:22.500
Other girls go shopping

10:23.333 --> 10:24.875
and all I do is baby-sit.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.583
And I know Baba says it's wrong
to want gold and diamonds,

10:29.042 --> 10:30.042
but why?

10:31.792 --> 10:34.417
If you're not satisfied
with who you are,

10:34.625 --> 10:37.250
a shiny rock
won't change anything.

10:40.417 --> 10:42.208
I'm worried about Dafina.

10:42.958 --> 10:43.958
[chuckles]

10:43.958 --> 10:45.833
You always worry about
the children.

10:46.292 --> 10:48.333
Usually all four of them,
at the same time.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.250
This is different.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.792
Dafina is changing.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.542
I know she's not
our little girl anymore,

10:56.167 --> 10:57.542
but why are you worried?

10:57.917 --> 11:01.042
She's curious about
gold and diamonds.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.333
Plant a seed
and you can eat the crop.

11:05.083 --> 11:08.167
Plant a diamond
and nothing grows.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.125
Yeah, but...
maybe if we bought something

11:11.417 --> 11:14.458
small for Dafina
...like a pair gold earrings,

11:14.833 --> 11:17.167
then she could see
that it's not a big deal.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.333
Here in the Sun Village...

11:19.708 --> 11:23.375
our soil, our plants,
our whole way of life

11:23.625 --> 11:25.792
is worth more
than all of the diamonds

11:25.792 --> 11:27.125
in the Moon Kingdom.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.083
One minute, Baba.

11:34.833 --> 11:37.833
Take your time, son.
You're not going anywhere today.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.333
Huh?

11:39.417 --> 11:41.125
You will stay home
and help your mother...

11:41.750 --> 11:43.750
Dafina, you will come with me.

11:52.333 --> 11:55.000
This place is so beautiful,
Baba.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.833
The real beauty is how
everything here has a purpose.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.333
Trees make the air we breathe.

12:01.708 --> 12:04.000
Without them, there is no life.

12:04.583 --> 12:07.083
And this one is
eight-hundred years old.

12:07.958 --> 12:08.958
Wow!

12:09.750 --> 12:11.375
[magical transformation]

12:13.375 --> 12:17.875
Actually,
I'm eight-hundred and sixteen,

12:18.375 --> 12:22.583
but I think I look
pretty good for my age.

12:23.292 --> 12:24.292
Huh?

12:25.208 --> 12:27.458
Whoa! Uh! [falls]

12:30.042 --> 12:32.833
Ebony,
this is my daughter, Dafina.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.833
[magical transformation]

12:38.750 --> 12:39.917
[tree whistles]

12:40.125 --> 12:42.708
Mm. Mmm. Mmmm! My, my, my!

12:44.333 --> 12:45.333
[kisses]

12:45.500 --> 12:48.208
Watch yourself or you might
end up being firewood.

12:48.833 --> 12:49.833
My bad,

12:50.625 --> 12:53.458
but your daughter is fine.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.375
[magical transformation]

12:55.500 --> 12:57.333
Baobob is such a flirt.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.500
He acts like that
with all the trees.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.000
[magical transformation]

13:01.042 --> 13:02.750
Man please,

13:03.167 --> 13:05.958
you know you ain't got no game.

13:06.708 --> 13:08.125
Do all of you...talk?

13:08.750 --> 13:10.917
We're always talking,

13:10.958 --> 13:14.042
but most folks
don't care to listen,

13:14.500 --> 13:17.833
except for your father,
he's a good man.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.583
Good man, my twig!

13:20.542 --> 13:23.125
He chops us up
into pieces for a living.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.958
But he always talks to us first

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
and he only takes what he needs.

13:29.458 --> 13:33.667
Other folks cut us down
without a thought or a care.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.417
If some fool lays one finger
on my bark,

13:36.625 --> 13:37.958
I've got something for 'em!

13:38.083 --> 13:41.125
Back up off me!
I said back up off me!

13:41.625 --> 13:44.625
[karate sounds]

13:51.042 --> 13:53.375
I meant to do that. (hurt) Oh!

13:53.583 --> 13:56.708
[laughs]

13:57.042 --> 13:58.708
This is all I need today.

13:59.292 --> 14:02.417
'Ey man, that's gonna cost you
ten cowry shells.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.083
Will that be credit or debit?

14:05.375 --> 14:08.125
Aw, shut your trunk, Baobab.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.792
I promise to put this
to good use.

14:11.875 --> 14:12.917
Take care, everybody.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.375
You do the same.

14:15.958 --> 14:16.958
See ya later!

14:17.083 --> 14:19.042
Don't leave a brotha hangin'.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.458
I was hoping
we could grab dinner sometime.

14:22.208 --> 14:23.667
You like mud pot pies?

14:24.542 --> 14:27.750
I always stress
that everything has a purpose.

14:28.708 --> 14:30.500
As you make the journey
into womanhood,

14:31.083 --> 14:34.167
your mother and I feel
it's important for you

14:34.208 --> 14:36.167
to embrace
that sense of purpose.

14:36.708 --> 14:37.708
Yeah!

14:38.542 --> 14:40.750
I guess I am a woman now
that I'm eighteen.

14:41.625 --> 14:44.750
Whoa-oh! Not so fast,
young lady.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.500
Look around you,

14:47.042 --> 14:48.917
everything here has a purpose.

14:49.833 --> 14:52.958
Dancers wear this mask
to honor the ancestors.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.792
Midwives wash newborn babies
in this bowl.

14:57.875 --> 15:01.208
And this will make a staff
for the lead council elder.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.667
Baba,
is that the princess stool?

15:09.583 --> 15:12.000
Can I sit in it? Please...

15:12.750 --> 15:15.208
Like I told you,
everything has a purpose.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.292
That was not made for you.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.083
This was.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.958
[leaves falling]

15:28.250 --> 15:30.000
[wood carving]

15:36.250 --> 15:37.250
Ouch!

15:41.250 --> 15:44.208
When I first learned,
this happened to me a lot.

15:44.958 --> 15:47.500
But accidents and mistakes
are the key to getting better.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.083
Someday, these will be
the hands of a great carver.

15:53.292 --> 15:56.292
[upbeat music]

15:56.500 --> 15:58.500
[babytalk]

15:59.625 --> 16:01.750
I had so much fun today!

16:02.083 --> 16:04.958
Not as much fun
as we did! (laughs)

16:05.292 --> 16:06.292
[babies laugh]

16:08.125 --> 16:11.125
So much for traditions, 'ey?
[laughs]

16:16.708 --> 16:18.958
Elder Femi will appreciate
your hard work.

16:19.958 --> 16:21.000
Baba!

16:21.458 --> 16:23.042
Why do we make
all this nice stuff

16:23.083 --> 16:24.083
for other people

16:24.167 --> 16:26.875
but we never get to
keep anything for ourselves?

16:27.625 --> 16:30.750
-You know that everything...
-Has a purpose...

16:32.833 --> 16:34.708
I'll get our lunch
on the way back.

[instrumental music]

16:59.125 --> 17:03.042
[instrument]

17:19.500 --> 17:21.541
I am Princess Dafina.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.291
Ruler of a mighty nation!

17:24.958 --> 17:26.375
(laughs)

17:28.250 --> 17:29.458
Princess Dafina...

17:29.833 --> 17:31.667
[Tamu]
It's my honor to serve you,

17:31.667 --> 17:33.167
Princess Dafina.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.583
[screams]

17:37.417 --> 17:38.417
Who said that?

17:41.042 --> 17:42.625
What have you done!?

17:43.083 --> 17:46.375
I am so sorry, I just...

17:46.708 --> 17:48.917
You disappoint me, Dafina.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.708
[babytalk]

18:05.042 --> 18:07.083
Ready to boogie across
the river?

18:12.667 --> 18:15.167
Um, I'll have to pass.

18:15.625 --> 18:16.625
Come on, girl!

18:23.250 --> 18:25.250
Mosi, I'm grounded.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.000
And even if I wasn't,

18:27.375 --> 18:29.958
Baba would never let me go
to a Moon Kingdom party.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.500
But I'm sure you'll have fun.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.792
Fun without you is like
the sky without the sun.

18:43.167 --> 18:44.458
[snoring]

18:49.500 --> 18:52.667
[Tamu] Dafina. Dafina.

18:56.042 --> 18:58.542
Mosi, um...

18:58.917 --> 19:01.292
tell me about the party later.

19:01.917 --> 19:03.167
DAFINA!

19:06.625 --> 19:08.417
What? [gasps]

19:08.833 --> 19:12.167
It's my honor to serve you,
Princess Dafina.

19:12.792 --> 19:15.083
Who-- what are you?

19:15.667 --> 19:19.667
I am Tamu, your loyal subject.

19:19.833 --> 19:20.833
Huh?

19:20.875 --> 19:23.000
When you sat on the royal stool,

19:23.500 --> 19:25.083
you became a princess.

19:25.708 --> 19:29.000
It was you..
you spoke to me in the forest...

19:29.833 --> 19:33.625
And now,
I'll take you to your palace.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.542
[giggles]

19:37.458 --> 19:38.458
What?

19:38.542 --> 19:40.208
[yawns]

19:40.958 --> 19:42.458
What are you doing?

19:43.042 --> 19:46.292
Ah...um...ah...bird watching.

19:47.833 --> 19:51.083
Mama, do you think
I could be a princess?

19:51.833 --> 19:54.375
You will be a queen
in your own right

19:54.500 --> 19:57.792
when you learn to appreciate
what you have. Um?

19:58.250 --> 19:59.917
[snaps green peas]

20:02.083 --> 20:04.833
But every girl dreams
of being a princess.

20:05.292 --> 20:08.167
I was always content
just being me.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.708
It figures you would say that,
Mama!

20:10.917 --> 20:11.917
[record stopping]

20:12.542 --> 20:15.917
Until you learn your lesson,
you'll stay grounded.

20:16.417 --> 20:17.417
Oooh!

20:17.625 --> 20:18.625
Oooh!

20:22.167 --> 20:23.333
Hey girl!

20:23.750 --> 20:26.750
Why was your man at
the party without you? Um

20:27.167 --> 20:28.833
Mosi is not my man.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.375
She probably didn't have
anything else to wear.

20:33.208 --> 20:35.583
Is that the only dress you got?

20:35.583 --> 20:36.792
[cheetah laughing]

20:36.833 --> 20:38.458
Listen, what I've got

20:38.875 --> 20:40.167
is none of your business!

20:40.917 --> 20:42.125
Whatever.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.083
Oh girl, let's go.
I'm running late

20:44.125 --> 20:45.125
for my hair appointment.

20:45.833 --> 20:46.833
[monkey laughs]

20:50.000 --> 20:51.542
[Tamu kicks the banana]

20:54.250 --> 20:55.250

20:56.125 --> 20:57.125
[laughs]

20:58.458 --> 20:59.458
Thanks.

20:59.542 --> 21:01.625
My pleasure, your highness.

21:01.833 --> 21:05.625
Are you real
or am I going crazy?

21:07.125 --> 21:08.500
You are real!

21:09.125 --> 21:12.750
Are you ready to go
to your palace, Princess Dafina?

21:13.375 --> 21:14.792
Sure. [giggles]

21:15.583 --> 21:17.792
But what about my family?

21:18.667 --> 21:20.458
Unfortunately,

21:20.458 --> 21:22.542
you'll have to
leave them behind.

21:23.417 --> 21:27.375
But just say the word,
and I'll bring you home.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.125
You can be princess for a day,

21:30.250 --> 21:32.833
a week, a month, a year...

21:32.833 --> 21:34.667
Are you some kind of genie?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.792
A genie can only grant you
three wishes.

21:38.292 --> 21:40.125
I can grant ya thousands.

21:40.542 --> 21:41.542
Wait a minute...

21:42.000 --> 21:43.292
What's the catch?

21:43.917 --> 21:44.917
Well...

21:44.958 --> 21:45.958
What is it?

21:46.292 --> 21:50.667
You can only be a princess
in the Moon Kingdom.

21:51.167 --> 21:52.333
What's wrong with that?

21:52.792 --> 21:55.917
It's quite different
from the Sun Village.

21:56.292 --> 21:58.708
I've been waiting
my whole life for different.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.125
Let's go!

22:00.542 --> 22:01.792
Hold on tight!

Whoa.

22:46.542 --> 22:48.042
This is amazing.

The amazing part is yet to come,
your highness.

[magical transformation]

22:56.250 --> 22:57.250
Wow!

22:58.167 --> 23:00.792
Right this way, Princess Dafina.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.875
I see you're not the only one.

23:18.708 --> 23:21.542
Does that make me
any less special?

23:21.833 --> 23:23.583
You're more than special,

23:23.875 --> 23:25.500
you made me a princess.

We'll be celebrating all month.

Perhaps we can
convince your father

to buy the diamond statue
you so deserve.

are there any vegetables?

Now that's a good one,

never plays with her food.

27:17.125 --> 27:19.250
[chews] Not bad.

27:20.625 --> 27:22.917
This would be nice
with some veggie stew.

27:24.125 --> 27:27.042
You know we only serve meat
in this palace.

to the Sun Village?

veggie stew is pretty tasty.

I hope you're not consorting
with those Sun kids.

for my little princess.

28:00.042 --> 28:03.000
Oh, really? But why?

28:03.708 --> 28:05.708
Because it's your
birthday month.

28:06.542 --> 28:09.792
You can pick out everything,
even the menu.

28:10.583 --> 28:14.000
I want okra, and yams, and rice,

some collard greens too?

28:47.583 --> 28:49.292
especially Mama's cooking.

28:49.417 --> 28:51.083
Are you ready to go home?

28:51.500 --> 28:53.500
It would be kinda rude
to leave now,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.333
The king is throwing me a party.

28:56.792 --> 28:59.083
I've never been to a...

28:59.542 --> 29:01.792
Par-tay! Par-tay! Par-tay!

29:02.167 --> 29:04.125
Whoa! [laughs]

29:04.917 --> 29:06.667
You remind me of someone.

29:07.292 --> 29:10.417
Is he handsome like me?

29:13.417 --> 29:15.583
I guess he's handsome
in his own way.

29:16.042 --> 29:18.792
Aaahhh... I see.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.708
No, it's not like that.

29:22.250 --> 29:23.542
Mosi is just a friend...

29:24.042 --> 29:26.292
I wonder if he would even
recognize me.

29:26.792 --> 29:29.958
I know Nubia and Sizani
would be so jealous.

29:30.583 --> 29:33.333
If seeing others jealous
makes you happy,

29:34.042 --> 29:36.000
I can grant that wish too.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.042
Nah

29:39.125 --> 29:41.667
Being a princess
is more than enough.

29:42.292 --> 29:43.292
[footsteps]

29:45.042 --> 29:47.000
There is no sign of Dafina.

29:49.708 --> 29:51.875
I asked everyone in the village.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.125
Nobody knows where she is.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.917
I pray nothing bad
has happened to her.

29:58.833 --> 29:59.833
[African music]

30:01.792 --> 30:05.417
Flawless diamonds
for a flawless princess.

30:14.042 --> 30:15.542
Thank you, Moon Queen.

30:16.708 --> 30:19.875
To this entire kingdom,
I am royalty,

30:20.875 --> 30:22.542
but my most important title

30:23.125 --> 30:24.708
will always be mother.

30:24.750 --> 30:28.000
Thank you...ah...Mama.

30:28.625 --> 30:30.542
You're so welcome, sweetie.

30:49.167 --> 30:51.167
I can't thank you enough,
Moon King.

30:53.667 --> 30:56.542
I mean, thanks Baba.

30:56.958 --> 31:00.542
Only the best
for my sweet princess.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.667
Well, this really turned out
to be a top-notch affair.

31:05.708 --> 31:07.750
And I can't get enough
of these collard greens

31:07.833 --> 31:08.833

31:30.500 --> 31:34.958

of Prince Ekene.

31:39.958 --> 31:42.167
What should I do?
What should I say?

31:42.583 --> 31:43.583
How's my hair?

31:44.833 --> 31:47.250
Oh, you are perfectly
lovely, dear.

31:47.292 --> 31:48.458
Just be yourself.

31:53.125 --> 31:56.458
Sweetheart, don't fall
for that ole' sky magic.

31:56.958 --> 32:00.042
Men do that all the time
when they want to...[hiccups]

32:04.500 --> 32:06.458
Good evening, Moonking,

32:07.708 --> 32:08.708
Moonqueen,

32:09.667 --> 32:11.917
and Princess Dafina.

32:12.542 --> 32:14.458
Can I please have this dance?

32:18.750 --> 32:21.417
[zap]
Stop right there, pretty boy.

32:21.667 --> 32:22.667
Darling,

32:23.292 --> 32:25.500
isn't this supposed
to be Dafina's night?

32:26.417 --> 32:30.500
[sighs] Alright.
But just one dance.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.250
[kisses]

32:33.333 --> 32:34.542
[trumpets playing]

32:36.917 --> 32:38.750
I was afraid
to even talk to you.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.708
Why? Because of the Moon King?

32:42.500 --> 32:44.042
Because of your beauty.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.792
Your eyes shine like
a million stars,

32:48.542 --> 32:50.333
your lips are as soft as...

32:50.750 --> 32:51.750
[faints]

32:54.583 --> 32:56.792
I've never been much
of a dancer.

32:57.167 --> 32:59.625
Hey, you still owe me a dance.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.417
-But I...
-If everything works out,

33:01.875 --> 33:04.083
we'll have our whole lives
to dance together.

33:04.292 --> 33:07.792
Whoa! Our whole lives!
You mean...

33:08.208 --> 33:10.000
I doubt your father
approves of me,

33:10.750 --> 33:13.083
the poorest prince
in the Moon Kingdom.

33:13.958 --> 33:16.083
My palace has only
fifteen bedrooms.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.917
But I could build an addition...

33:19.542 --> 33:22.917
My parents taught me
that the size of a hut...

33:22.917 --> 33:26.458
I mean a palace, doesn't matter
as much as the love inside.

33:27.167 --> 33:29.250
Then maybe I can
convince the king

33:29.333 --> 33:30.750
that I'm worthy
of your hand.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.208
I realize we just met,

33:33.708 --> 33:36.958
but what I feel goes deeper
than love at first sight.

33:37.667 --> 33:40.667
Princess Dafina,
I want to marry you.

33:44.833 --> 33:47.875
[dreams] Princess Dafina,
I want to marry you.

33:48.917 --> 33:51.042
Psst. Princess Dafina!

33:51.708 --> 33:52.708
[yawns]

33:55.125 --> 33:56.125
Hey, Tamu.

33:56.792 --> 33:59.708
Did you shake a tail feather?
Um. Um. Um!

33:59.792 --> 34:03.125
[giggles] No.
But tonight was perfect.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.667
The perfect food,
the perfect music,

34:06.083 --> 34:07.375
the perfect prince.

34:08.292 --> 34:11.542
Does that mean
you don't want to go home?

34:12.167 --> 34:15.625
Life here is amazing,
but I can't stay.

34:16.042 --> 34:17.875
I'm gonna tell Prince Ekene
the truth,

34:18.208 --> 34:19.667
then he can meet my real family,

34:19.917 --> 34:21.458
and we can all move
into his palace.

34:21.875 --> 34:23.792
He's got fifteen bedrooms,
you know.

34:24.667 --> 34:25.667
Impressive.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.167
None of this would've happened
without you.

34:28.583 --> 34:29.583
You're like family!

34:30.042 --> 34:32.125
Tamu,
I want you to live with us.

34:32.792 --> 34:36.833
It would be my honor,
Princess Dafina.

34:38.625 --> 34:42.167
[instrument]

34:55.833 --> 34:56.833
Ouch!

34:57.083 --> 34:58.792
I am so sorry,
your highness.

34:59.750 --> 35:03.458
You're fired, you incompetent
peasant Sun girl!

35:03.875 --> 35:06.625
Moon Queen, I mean Mama,

35:07.167 --> 35:08.750
she made an honest mistake.

35:08.958 --> 35:09.958
[door opens]

35:10.625 --> 35:12.000

[seamstress cries]

35:15.417 --> 35:16.917
You didn't have to do that.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.875
She gave me no choice.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.542
You just can't reason
with those people.

35:21.708 --> 35:23.667
But what do you mean
when you say "those people."

35:24.083 --> 35:27.375
The Sun Village is full
of hopeless souls

35:27.875 --> 35:30.292
who spend
their miserable little lives

35:30.542 --> 35:32.667
wanting what we have.

35:33.167 --> 35:34.375
Not all of them...

35:34.833 --> 35:35.833
In time,

35:36.083 --> 35:37.917
you'll see the truth
for yourself.

[fireworks]

35:52.042 --> 35:53.042
Wow.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.167
All of this for me?

35:56.625 --> 35:58.167
I wanna give you much more.

35:58.625 --> 35:59.625
[kiss]

35:59.833 --> 36:01.333
Are you always this romantic?

36:01.625 --> 36:03.083
I'm just getting warmed up.

36:03.375 --> 36:06.167
So tell me, Prince Ekene...

36:06.250 --> 36:08.417
Yes, Princess Dafina?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.458
What's your favorite joke?

36:10.542 --> 36:12.542
I really don't have one.

36:12.625 --> 36:14.833
Ever hear the one about
the cheetah and the giraffe?

36:15.458 --> 36:18.417
It was a hot day and the cheetah
went under the tree,

36:18.833 --> 36:22.292
or was it the bush?
No, the cheetah went
under the tree...

36:22.625 --> 36:25.625
-and--
-Wait,
is that a Sun Village joke?

36:25.833 --> 36:27.667
You got something
against Sun people?

36:27.875 --> 36:30.792
What if I told you
that I was really
a wood carver's daughter...

36:31.083 --> 36:32.667
from the Sun Village?

side of the island you're from.
-You don't?

36:42.083 --> 36:45.125
You're so sweet and beautiful.

36:45.208 --> 36:48.042
I couldn't imagine
life without you.

36:48.125 --> 36:52.208
So... you would still marry me,
even if I was a Sun girl?

36:52.417 --> 36:55.875
Me? Marry a Sun girl? [laughs]

36:56.250 --> 36:59.292
No. But you'd make
a great concubine.

-good-for-nothing seamstress
that I fired?
-What?

37:47.958 --> 37:49.833
There is no Sun girl here.

Now get off this property
at once!

find our daughter?

not know me?

I'm done being a princess.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.667
My own parents didn't know me!

39:27.750 --> 39:32.333
That's because you called
the moon queen and the moon king
"Mama" and "Baba."

39:32.667 --> 39:33.708
I know.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.750
I never should've done that.

to go home to my real family.

talking like that?

this is the real me.

42:46.375 --> 42:47.625
Alright.

Alright, I'll give you
a few days to adjust.

42:51.125 --> 42:52.458

You'll learn to love me

43:19.625 --> 43:22.875

43:22.958 --> 43:23.958
Don't tell me...

43:24.167 --> 43:27.917
he promised to make you
a princess with his magic

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
and his fake British accent.

43:31.208 --> 43:32.917
I never should've left home.

43:33.083 --> 43:38.625
I made that same mistake...
five years ago.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.375
[chime]
No. Uh-uh.

43:40.958 --> 43:42.625
Definitely not!

43:42.708 --> 43:46.375
I asked for an exact replica
of the princess dress!

43:46.542 --> 43:48.542
That's impossible.

43:48.625 --> 43:54.292
The royal family
uses a special fabric
that nobody can buy.

43:54.375 --> 43:57.750
Mother, you disappoint me.

43:57.958 --> 44:02.000
I'm sure the queen
never disappoints her daughter.

44:02.083 --> 44:06.167
If your father
was still alive, he would--

44:06.250 --> 44:08.000
This isn't about him.

44:08.375 --> 44:12.208
It's about
you not giving me what I want!

44:12.292 --> 44:16.125
Ife...
I can't make you a princess.

44:21.292 --> 44:23.792
[mocking mother] "Ife,
I can't make you a princess."

44:24.125 --> 44:25.542
Well, why not?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.375
A face this beautiful...

44:29.000 --> 44:31.250
belongs in a palace.

44:31.333 --> 44:34.625
-[Tamu] I agree, Princess Ife.
-[Ife screams]

44:36.208 --> 44:39.750
[Ife] I thought
I was hearing voices
until the night he appeared.

44:50.292 --> 44:52.500
-[Paparazzi 1] Princess Ife!
-[Paparazzi 2] Over here!

44:52.583 --> 44:53.708
Psst!

44:53.875 --> 44:57.417
[Ife] I also realized that
I had been a spoiled
you-know-what,

44:57.500 --> 45:00.875
that I had been living the life
of a princess all along,

45:01.083 --> 45:03.417
-except for the Paparazzi.
-Huh?

45:03.917 --> 45:09.583
[Paparazzi laughing]

45:10.083 --> 45:12.500
[Ife] I begged Tamu
to bring me home.

45:13.208 --> 45:15.167
[descending xylophone scale]

45:16.708 --> 45:19.792
[magical music]

45:20.292 --> 45:23.333
But he brought me here,
to Daybreak Mountain.

45:24.042 --> 45:27.792
His first wife, Zalika,
told me the truth about him.

45:27.875 --> 45:33.375
People like Tamu,
they give away their humanity
for riches or magic powers.

45:41.875 --> 45:46.000
He used a spell to make me
believe I was a princess,

45:46.458 --> 45:50.375
but I had been captive
on this mountain the whole time.

45:51.375 --> 45:54.917
He did the same thing to you.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.000
That does not make sense.

45:58.083 --> 46:01.042
I was at the Moon Palace,
I was there!

46:01.500 --> 46:02.500
No...

46:02.875 --> 46:04.458
Tamu brought you here...

46:04.792 --> 46:06.167
a year ago.

46:06.542 --> 46:09.208
You never stepped foot
in the Moon Palace.

46:09.292 --> 46:11.875
You never met the Moon Queen
or the Moon King.

46:12.208 --> 46:13.250
-You ne--
-No!

46:13.583 --> 46:17.125
I begged Tamu to let you go,
but...

46:17.208 --> 46:19.500
Uh-uh! I gotta get out of here!

46:19.750 --> 46:21.583
Please, stop!

46:22.042 --> 46:24.292
I don't want
you to end up like Zalika.

46:24.375 --> 46:25.667
What happened to her?

46:25.750 --> 46:28.333
One day, she tried to escape

46:28.417 --> 46:29.583
and she fell.

46:29.667 --> 46:32.875
There's no way to make it
off this mountain alive.

46:34.167 --> 46:35.167
Ew!

46:35.500 --> 46:37.292
Here, you try it!

46:40.250 --> 46:42.125
-[grasshopper hops]
-Ugh!

46:42.208 --> 46:46.167
Oh, that's nothing compared
to the stink beetle stew.

46:46.250 --> 46:47.250
Uughh!

46:47.625 --> 46:50.000
I'd do anything
to get back home.

46:50.083 --> 46:52.500
I miss my family so much.

46:53.042 --> 46:54.750
I miss my boyfriend too...

46:55.250 --> 46:58.708
[chuckles] even his corny jokes.

46:58.792 --> 47:01.333
Sounds like
a lot of people love you.

47:01.708 --> 47:03.417
I really miss my mother.

47:03.667 --> 47:06.750
I may never see her again,
but if I make it to heaven--

47:06.833 --> 47:09.500
Uh-uh. Don't give up
on getting out of here.

47:09.583 --> 47:12.375
Dafina, trust me,
we're stuck here.

47:12.750 --> 47:17.000
Hmm, not if we spice these up
with a little poison.

47:17.083 --> 47:19.875
Tamu bought everything
in this kitchen.

47:20.042 --> 47:21.375
So what's the plan?

47:21.667 --> 47:24.375
Honey,
when you go to the market,

47:24.458 --> 47:27.625
pick up some ginger,
some cinnamon...

47:28.125 --> 47:30.667
oh, and some poison too.

47:30.750 --> 47:32.333
Oh trust me...

47:32.833 --> 47:34.333
there's another way.

47:36.458 --> 47:39.042
-[grasshopper] Oh no!
-[Ife] Is that poisonous?

47:39.125 --> 47:40.125
Uh-uh.

47:40.583 --> 47:42.250
How about that one?

47:44.792 --> 47:46.167
I guess not.

47:50.708 --> 47:52.417

[Dafina gasps]

48:00.583 --> 48:04.417
[breathing heavily]

48:05.708 --> 48:07.417
It's so beautiful.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.917
Are you sure it's this one?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Oh yeah.

48:11.375 --> 48:14.667
Pretty things
can do the most damage.

48:15.417 --> 48:18.083
And that's exactly what
Tamu is gonna find out tonight.

48:18.167 --> 48:22.125
[dramatic music]

48:23.250 --> 48:25.042
[slurps]

48:25.917 --> 48:30.000
[exhales and clears throat]
That's it...

48:30.083 --> 48:34.375
A wife should always respond
to her husband's needs.

48:35.167 --> 48:38.750
By the way,
how you two getting along?

48:39.083 --> 48:41.375
Oh, great! [giggles]

48:41.458 --> 48:42.958
Wonderful! [giggles]

48:43.042 --> 48:46.458
Has Dafina been
helping around the kitchen?

48:47.042 --> 48:49.667
Ife is teaching me
everything you like.

48:49.750 --> 48:53.292
Two beautiful wives
cooking my favorite meals.

48:53.375 --> 48:56.125
I'm one lucky man.

49:43.458 --> 49:46.958
to my... [coughs]

49:47.042 --> 49:51.417
Ah, maybe you'll feel better
in the morning.

It's too late for me.

50:29.583 --> 50:31.125
[Tamu sighs]

50:31.208 --> 50:35.917
It's gonna take
more than berry poison
to get rid of yours truly!

50:36.542 --> 50:38.750
By the way, how was my acting?

50:41.500 --> 50:42.750
[funny noises]

50:42.833 --> 50:44.250
[Ife] Dafina, no!

50:44.333 --> 50:45.833
I can't stay here!

50:46.083 --> 50:47.917
But it's too dangerous to--

50:48.000 --> 50:50.583
[Tamu] Play time is over, girls!

50:52.792 --> 50:53.750
[Dafina] Ugh!

We've been waiting for you,

51:30.667 --> 51:35.167
I'm Marula, and this is
my twin brother, Adisa.

51:35.250 --> 51:36.875
So, what's up?

51:36.958 --> 51:41.667
Ah! Wait... is this heaven?

Naw, but we can take ya higher,
Sista Dafina.

51:46.292 --> 51:47.583
You know me?

Mm-hm, you're Ebony's home girl.

51:51.083 --> 51:53.583
I owe my life to both of you.

51:53.917 --> 51:56.292
Thanks so much for saving me.

51:56.375 --> 51:58.292
We're happy to help.

Listen, I... I um...

Out with it.

The squeaky wheel gets oil.

A watched pot never boils.

no bread, and I said--

52:13.083 --> 52:16.333
In other words,
speak your mind, girl.

52:16.417 --> 52:20.917
Ah, I really need
one more big favor.

thank you a million times,

that would never be enough.

Tell Ebony we say "hi."

It's been two years
since we've seen Dafina.

53:49.583 --> 53:51.917
I think about her every day.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.750
Yeah, I really miss her too.

53:54.833 --> 53:57.458
I just wish
we could see her one more time.

54:15.667 --> 54:18.208
I'm so sorry for what I did.

54:18.583 --> 54:20.000
I never should've left.

54:20.083 --> 54:22.375
I worried about you
all the time.

54:22.458 --> 54:25.250
We were afraid that
you were gone forever. Oh!

54:25.333 --> 54:26.917
I was afraid too.

54:32.542 --> 54:36.750
[piano music]

54:37.375 --> 54:39.792
I had everything
I could ever want,

54:41.333 --> 54:43.458
except the most important thing.

54:44.625 --> 54:50.417
I found out... that nothing
can replace the people you love.

54:59.333 --> 55:03.667
But when I wanted to come home,
I walked right into a nightmare.

55:07.750 --> 55:10.708
Thinking of all of you
kept me strong.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.917
And my friend, Ife,
she kept me sane.

55:14.958 --> 55:17.875
I knew I'd be back
where I belong one day.

55:24.583 --> 55:27.792
I'm real sorry that you had to
go through all of that.

55:28.208 --> 55:30.792
I wish I could've
been there to protect you.

55:30.875 --> 55:32.083
Oh, Baba...

55:32.167 --> 55:34.792
you taught me that
everything has a purpose.

55:34.875 --> 55:40.042
And what happened... Well,
that only made me more grateful
to finally be home.

55:40.125 --> 55:42.500
We love you so much, Dafina!

55:42.583 --> 55:45.708
And I love all of you! [laughs]

55:46.042 --> 55:49.417

01:08:31.082 --> 01:08:33.582
I pronounce you...

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:36.625
husband and wife.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.707
I'm sure you know
what to do next.

01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:43.457
[applause]

01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:48.957
[kids] Ooohh!

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:54.042
[happy music]

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:59.332
[harp music]

01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:05.417
[chimes]

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:10.417
[kiss]

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:15.332
[narrator] Well,
after the sun and moon made up

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:21.457
they decided to share
both sides of Kisiwa Island.

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:32.582
And that was the beginning
of day and night as we know it.

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:34.957
Oh, because you kissed Grandma!

01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:37.000
It was a kiss to remember.

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:42.125
-Ah!
-Actually,
Ife and I helped the Sun Village

01:09:42.207 --> 01:09:45.457
and the Moon Kingdom
reach a peace treaty.

01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:48.832
What's a pee treaty?

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:50.832
Oh! [laughs]

01:09:50.917 --> 01:09:55.167
A peace treaty
is an understanding
between people.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:57.500
Oh, it took many years...

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.542
But things got better between
Sun folks and Moon folks.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:06.750
And when our son
married Ife's daughter,

01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:10.000
all of you were like
the honey on the yams.

01:10:10.583 --> 01:10:14.833
Grandma, did you ever want
to be a rich princess again?

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:16.958
You know, like you used to be?

01:10:17.042 --> 01:10:20.042
This land, this life...

01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:21.833
and you grandchildren...

01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:24.583
Why you're my greatest riches.

01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:29.250
If you have love,
[laughs] you have everything.

01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:32.583
Grandma,
please tell us another story.

01:10:32.667 --> 01:10:36.083
Oh now, it's getting
kinda late, sweetheart.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.375
Aw...

01:10:37.458 --> 01:10:41.333
But, I think we have time
for a joke.

01:10:41.417 --> 01:10:43.958
[children laugh]

01:10:44.042 --> 01:10:47.958
-Now, Mosi...
-[child yawns]

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:51.792
Grandpa, it's almost bedtime!

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:53.750
Um, let's see...

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.083
if I can remember how it goes.

01:10:56.167 --> 01:10:58.375
[children] Oh!

01:10:58.417 --> 01:10:59.417
Don't tell me...

01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:03.917
is this the one about
the cheetah and the giraffe?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.125
[everyone laughing]
[chimes]

01:11:11.292 --> 01:11:13.750
[happy music]

01:11:16.042 --> 01:11:18.958
[chimes]

01:11:19.305 --> 01:11:25.480
