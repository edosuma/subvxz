WEBVTT

00:02.796 --> 00:04.664
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

00:04.666 --> 00:06.232
You work the lunch shift?

00:06.234 --> 00:09.168
Yeah. I've got eight pounds of
salmon that's about to go bad.

00:09.170 --> 00:10.705
Do you know
how to cook it?

00:10.707 --> 00:12.273
- Not really.
- Damn it.

00:12.275 --> 00:15.010
Should have liberated
the iffy chicken.

00:15.012 --> 00:18.447
What are you and Professor
Fussyface up to tonight?

00:18.449 --> 00:21.149
<i>Star Wars</i> on Blu-ray.

00:21.151 --> 00:24.118
Haven't you seen that movie,
like, a thousand times?

00:24.120 --> 00:26.253
Not on Blu-ray.

00:26.255 --> 00:28.288
Only twice on Blu-ray.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.690
Oh, Leonard.

00:30.692 --> 00:34.993
I know, it's
high-resolution sadness.

00:34.995 --> 00:38.162
Well, I'm going to take myself
out to a movie tonight.

00:38.164 --> 00:39.363
You want to go?

00:39.365 --> 00:40.797
Really? Do we do that?

00:40.799 --> 00:42.365
What do you mean?

00:42.367 --> 00:44.268
You know, we haven't spent
time alone together

00:44.270 --> 00:45.769
since we broke up.

00:45.771 --> 00:47.672
Oh, it's not a date, Leonard.

00:47.674 --> 00:49.125
It's just a man and a woman
hanging out, not having sex

00:49.150 --> 00:50.543
at the end of the night.

00:52.412 --> 00:55.112
Sounds like
most of my dates.

00:55.114 --> 00:59.450
SHELDON: Oh, dear Lord, get away
from me, you monster!

00:59.452 --> 01:01.752
What is that about?

01:01.754 --> 01:03.654
Well, he's smart
and crazy enough,

01:03.656 --> 01:05.722
he may have actually
created a monster.

01:05.724 --> 01:09.126
Shoo, shoo!
Be gone!

01:09.128 --> 01:10.528
What the hell is going on?

01:10.530 --> 01:13.831
There's a bird outside the
window, and he won't go away.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.833
That is the hell
that is going on.

01:15.835 --> 01:18.303
We have no worms or seeds here.

01:18.305 --> 01:19.771
Shoo, shoo.

01:19.773 --> 01:23.708
Really? On top of everything
else, you're afraid of birds?

01:23.710 --> 01:26.010
It's called ornithophobia.

01:26.012 --> 01:27.545
And someday it will
be recognized

01:27.547 --> 01:30.315
as a true disability, and the
landlord will be required by law

01:30.317 --> 01:32.316
to put a giant net
over the building.

01:33.418 --> 01:36.754
Which is unfortunate, because
I have a fear of nets.

01:36.756 --> 01:39.256
So movies, yes or no?

01:39.258 --> 01:41.091
Movies, yes.

01:41.093 --> 01:42.926
Great. I'll see you later.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.395
And remember, he's more afraid
of you than you are of him.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.329
That doesn't help.

01:46.331 --> 01:50.867
No, I was talking
to the bird.

01:51.835 --> 01:56.738
Go away, bird. Go away, bird.
Go away, bird.

01:56.740 --> 01:59.440
Sheldon, just ignore him.

01:59.442 --> 02:03.311
Good idea.
Attention is what birds want.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.716
Oh, much better. All right.

02:07.718 --> 02:09.985
Now I'll just get along
with my life.

02:09.987 --> 02:12.922
(bird squawks)

02:12.924 --> 02:15.992
Make a pot of tea, Leonard.
It's going to be a long night.

The bird's still there?

Quick, what does
a hawk sound like?

03:06.717 --> 03:08.483
I don't know--

03:08.485 --> 03:11.486
scree-scree.

03:11.488 --> 03:12.788
Please, that's a seagull.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.157
If you're not going
to help, don't help.

03:15.159 --> 03:17.893
Sorry. Do you think
I'm overdressed?

03:17.895 --> 03:20.196
It depends on the activity.

03:20.198 --> 03:21.797
For a prostate exam, yes.

03:21.799 --> 03:26.369
If you're playing Vegas,
I'd add sequins.

03:26.371 --> 03:27.938
I'm going to the movies
with Penny.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.674
I don't want her to think
that I think it's a date.

03:30.676 --> 03:32.309
Do you think it's a date?

03:32.311 --> 03:34.845
No, but she might think I think
it's a date even though I don't.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.247
Or you might think she thinks you think
it's a date even though she doesn't.

03:37.249 --> 03:40.383
- Are we overthinking this?
- Not at all.

03:40.385 --> 03:42.785
You're right. I'm fine.
I'm wearing this.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.821
Really? A blazer?
All right.

03:51.994 --> 03:53.561
Yes, hello.

03:53.563 --> 03:55.497
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

03:55.499 --> 03:58.366
I'm at 2311 North Robles Avenue.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.136
I'd like to report
a dangerous wild animal.

04:01.138 --> 04:03.339
A blue jay.

04:03.341 --> 04:06.142
I'm sorry, this is
Animal Control.

04:06.144 --> 04:08.345
I don't understand the laughter.

04:08.347 --> 04:10.814
No, the bird is not in my home.

04:10.816 --> 04:14.752
If he was in my home, I
obviously would have called 911.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.720
Sir, I have no doubt that
there are things

04:16.721 --> 04:18.522
that you're frightened of.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.625
Being stuck in a dead-end
public service job.

04:21.627 --> 04:23.227
Or your wife stepping out on you

04:23.229 --> 04:25.996
because you're stuck in
a dead-end public service job.

04:25.998 --> 04:28.899
Or spiders.

04:28.901 --> 04:31.234
Don't you think I tried
making cat noises?

04:35.672 --> 04:38.641
Too casual?

04:38.643 --> 04:40.543
For an audience
with the queen, yes.

04:40.545 --> 04:43.078
For an evening of passing
a bottle of fortified wine

04:43.080 --> 04:45.647
around a flaming trash can,
you look great.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.074

04:58.061 --> 05:00.495
(imitates cat snarling
and hissing)

05:02.498 --> 05:05.033
What am I thinking?
Whiskers.

05:08.890 --> 05:10.028
Oh, hey, if we hurry,

05:10.029 --> 05:11.845
we can make the new
Jennifer Aniston movie.

05:11.846 --> 05:13.046
Oh, yeah, sure.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.473
There's also
an amazing documentary

05:15.475 --> 05:18.810
about building a dam
on a river in South America.

05:18.812 --> 05:23.347
Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston
movie has Jennifer Aniston,

05:23.349 --> 05:25.783
and she's not
building a dam.

05:25.785 --> 05:27.751
Can't argue with that.

05:27.753 --> 05:30.053
- I'll get the tickets.
- Okay.

05:31.022 --> 05:33.957
Actually, you know what?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.860
I think it's about time
I picked a movie we see.

05:36.862 --> 05:39.262
You pick plenty of movies.

05:39.264 --> 05:41.331
No. You always picked,

05:41.333 --> 05:42.899
and it was always the same.

05:42.901 --> 05:45.134
An hour and a half of
beach houses in the rain

05:45.136 --> 05:46.713
until the woman turns
around and realizes love

05:46.738 --> 05:48.229
was here all along.

05:49.674 --> 05:53.743
Come on, that is a great movie,
and it starts in ten minutes.

05:53.745 --> 05:55.511
I hate those movies.

05:55.513 --> 05:57.480
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

05:57.482 --> 06:01.250
The only reason I went is
because you wanted to see them,

06:01.252 --> 06:03.285
and I wanted to have sex.

06:03.287 --> 06:06.087
To this day, I can't see
a Sandra Bullock movie poster

06:06.089 --> 06:08.856
without getting both
bored and aroused.

06:08.858 --> 06:10.591
Okay, so while we
were going out,

06:10.593 --> 06:14.361
how often would you pretend to like
things just to have sex with me?

06:14.363 --> 06:16.630
All the time.

06:16.632 --> 06:19.533
You're kidding.

06:19.535 --> 06:20.968
Does this sound familiar?

06:20.970 --> 06:23.971
I'd love to go
shoe shopping with you.

06:23.973 --> 06:26.206
Hiking? It's great.

06:26.208 --> 06:29.869
It's 2:00 a.m., of course I want
to go to Korea Town and sing

06:29.894 --> 06:30.957
karaoke with your friends.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.624
Who wouldn't?

06:33.247 --> 06:34.713
Okay, we were going out.

06:34.715 --> 06:36.448
You were going
to get sex anyway.

06:36.450 --> 06:38.792
Really? You would have slept
with me after a three-hour

06:38.817 --> 06:40.676
documentary on dams?

06:41.621 --> 06:45.322
No. No woman would.

06:45.324 --> 06:47.992
See? Now, that's
the great thing.

06:47.994 --> 06:49.860
We're out as friends.
This is not a date.

06:49.862 --> 06:51.328
Sex is off the table.

06:51.330 --> 06:53.931
So, let's go learn how
hydroelectric power

06:53.933 --> 06:57.302
might not be the environmental
bargain you think it is.

06:57.837 --> 07:01.340
Sorry. Spoiler alert.

07:02.142 --> 07:04.543
All right, fine.

07:04.545 --> 07:06.312
Thanks.

07:06.314 --> 07:08.148
Tickets are 11 bucks.

07:10.919 --> 07:14.053
Not a date.

07:17.124 --> 07:19.491
Come on, Sheldon,
<i>Star Wars.</i>

07:19.493 --> 07:21.626
I'm pushing play.
I mean it.

07:21.628 --> 07:22.727
If we don't start soon,

07:22.729 --> 07:26.030
George Lucas is going
to change it again.

07:27.198 --> 07:29.433
This would go a lot faster

07:29.435 --> 07:31.568
if you put your trade school
diploma to work

07:31.570 --> 07:34.504
and helped me set up this
high-frequency tone generator.

07:34.506 --> 07:37.707
I have a Masters degree
from M.I.T.

07:37.709 --> 07:39.342
Yeah, but you've got
a can-do attitude

07:39.344 --> 07:41.011
and that's what's important.

07:42.881 --> 07:45.349
I really don't get
your problem with birds.

07:45.351 --> 07:47.285
The question you
should be asking

07:47.287 --> 07:49.888
is what is their problem
with me?

07:49.890 --> 07:54.125
My first memory: A hummingbird
dive-bombing my stroller

07:54.127 --> 07:57.429
to get at the apple juice
in my sippy cup.

07:57.431 --> 07:59.264
Hummingbirds are pretty.

07:59.266 --> 08:03.401
Hummingbirds are the vampires
of the flower world.

08:04.636 --> 08:07.904
Still my first choice
for an ankle tattoo.

08:09.173 --> 08:12.741
Or a dolphin--
I go back and forth.

08:12.743 --> 08:16.178
Age seven, a blood-thirsty
chicken chases me up a tree.

08:16.180 --> 08:21.516
Age 12, a magpie tries to steal
the retainer out of my mouth.

08:21.518 --> 08:25.955
Age 16, a parrot in a
pet store calls me fat ass.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.591
Need I go on?

08:28.593 --> 08:30.425
Yes, please. This is way better
than the movie.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.928
(laughing)
All right, Sheldon,

08:32.929 --> 08:34.663
your bird death ray is ready.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.198
It's not a death ray.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.500
It's just a little ultrasonic
blast to scare him off.

08:38.501 --> 08:40.436
Trust me, if I had a death ray,

08:40.438 --> 08:42.136
I wouldn't be living here.

08:42.139 --> 08:44.607
I'd be in my lair
enjoying the money

08:44.609 --> 08:47.643
the people of Earth gave me
for not using my death ray.

08:47.645 --> 08:49.678
All right, and in three,

08:49.680 --> 08:51.847
two, one.

08:51.849 --> 08:53.349
(pushes button)

09:00.390 --> 09:03.792
That is one
tough birdie.

09:05.028 --> 09:07.129
Come on, you enjoyed
the movie.

09:07.131 --> 09:09.632
I saw you tearing up
when the village got flooded,

09:09.634 --> 09:11.400
and everyone
had to relocate.

09:11.402 --> 09:14.536
No, I was thinking how come
they get to leave and I can't.

09:15.371 --> 09:17.439
I'm going to get some fries.

09:17.441 --> 09:18.640
You want anything?

09:18.642 --> 09:20.241
- Uh, no, thanks.
- Are you sure?

09:20.243 --> 09:23.378
You always say no, and then
you eat half my fries.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.880
I just eat the little crispy
ones you don't like.

09:25.882 --> 09:28.549
No, I love them.
I save them for the end,

09:28.551 --> 09:30.718
but they're gone
because you ate them.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.120
And why did

09:32.122 --> 09:33.254
I let you eat them?

09:33.256 --> 09:35.256
- To get sex.
- Exactly.

09:36.459 --> 09:38.293
But this is
not a date.

09:38.295 --> 09:40.662
So I ask again,
would you like anything?

09:40.664 --> 09:42.498
All right, I'd like
an order of fries.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.001
Great. That'll be five dollars.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.039
I am having the best time.

09:49.041 --> 09:52.042
I'm so glad you suggested
we do this.

09:52.044 --> 09:54.144
Oh, sorry.

09:54.146 --> 09:56.079
No problem.

09:56.081 --> 09:58.214
What you writing there?

09:58.216 --> 09:59.882
A screenplay.

09:59.884 --> 10:01.883
Its about a guy whose
roommate is having sex

10:01.885 --> 10:05.988
and tells him to go to a bar
and work on his screenplay.

10:05.990 --> 10:09.324
"I Hope Alex Gets Crabs:
The Movie."

10:09.326 --> 10:12.760
- It's a working title.
- Oh. (chuckles)

10:12.762 --> 10:13.928
- I'm Kevin.
- Oh. Penny.

10:13.930 --> 10:15.029
Nice to meet you.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.031
I'll let you get
back to your date.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.799
Oh, no, no.
This isn't a date, no.

10:18.801 --> 10:21.935
Right?

10:22.737 --> 10:24.237
Uh... right.

10:24.239 --> 10:26.807
So have you written anything
I might have seen?

10:26.809 --> 10:29.844
That depends. How much time
do you spend on Yelp?

10:32.949 --> 10:36.685
(light sabers crackling on TV)
(bird squawks outside)

10:39.022 --> 10:40.923
(bird squawking)

10:42.559 --> 10:44.661
This is ridiculous.

10:44.663 --> 10:47.030
I'm a grown man from Texas.

10:47.032 --> 10:50.667
This isn't a terrifying bird
like a swan or a goose.

10:50.669 --> 10:52.569
(bird squawking)

10:52.571 --> 10:54.470
It's just a blue jay.

11:00.009 --> 11:02.144
That's a pretty big blue jay.

11:20.297 --> 11:21.964
One...

11:21.966 --> 11:23.032
two...

11:23.034 --> 11:24.234
three.

11:25.069 --> 11:28.037
Go! Shoo!
Am-scray, ird-bay!

11:28.039 --> 11:30.940
(gasps)
Bird in the apartment!

11:30.942 --> 11:32.275
Bird in the apartment!

11:32.277 --> 11:34.778
No!

11:40.098 --> 11:43.667
So it is an amazing
documentary.

11:43.669 --> 11:47.504
They need the electricity from
the dam, but at the same time,

11:47.506 --> 11:51.208
they want to preserve
the environment.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.177
You're kidding me.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.815
Uh, can I see you
for a sec over here?

11:58.817 --> 12:00.517
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Just one sec?

12:00.519 --> 12:02.552
No problem.

12:02.554 --> 12:03.553
What's up?

12:03.555 --> 12:04.754
I know what you're doing.

12:04.756 --> 12:06.523
- What am I doing?
- You're going out of your way

12:06.525 --> 12:08.859
to talk to that guy because
I said we weren't on a date.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.727
No, I'm talking to him
because he's cute.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.895
Come on, he's not that cute.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.263
Yes, he is.

12:13.265 --> 12:17.000
With his dorky T-shirt
and his little hipster glasses.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.007
I wear dorky T-shirts
and glasses.

12:25.009 --> 12:27.810
Yes, but when you're tall
and have great cheekbones,

12:27.812 --> 12:29.545
you're doing it ironically.

12:31.547 --> 12:34.249
If that's so, what if I
start talking to a girl?

12:34.251 --> 12:35.784
You should!

12:35.786 --> 12:37.051
I'm serious.
I'll do it.

12:37.053 --> 12:39.654
Good! Go! There are some
girls right over there.

12:43.358 --> 12:44.591
What are you waiting for?

12:44.593 --> 12:47.160
They're in a group.
I'm scared.

12:48.329 --> 12:50.898
Sheldon, what do you
expect us to do?

12:53.035 --> 12:54.469
You're biologists.

12:54.471 --> 12:56.304
Biology is the study
of living things.

12:56.306 --> 12:58.607
That's a living thing;
get cracking.

13:00.477 --> 13:02.745
I specialize in microorganisms,

13:02.747 --> 13:04.480
and Amy studies brains.

13:04.482 --> 13:07.417
Yeah, neither of us
minored in bird-shooing.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.452
Oh, come now.

13:09.454 --> 13:11.321
Your undergraduate work
must have included

13:11.323 --> 13:13.590
a varmints and critters class.

13:13.592 --> 13:16.493
Come back in, Sheldon,
he's not going to hurt you.

13:16.495 --> 13:19.129
He looks friendly.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.297
I think he might
be someone's pet.

13:21.299 --> 13:22.732
No, Bernadette, don't be a hero!

13:22.734 --> 13:26.102
Oh, he's a sweetie.

13:26.104 --> 13:28.004
Yes. It's very sweet.

13:28.006 --> 13:30.440
Now, slowly and carefully,

13:30.442 --> 13:33.277
flush him down the toilet.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.717
Sheldon, the only way
to get past this fear

13:38.719 --> 13:40.018
is to interact with it.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.955
Just like you did
with the mailman.

13:42.957 --> 13:48.060
Every year tens of people around
the world are killed by birds.

13:49.063 --> 13:52.098
I'm not going to be
another statistic.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.301
Look how sweet he is.
Come over and say hi.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.906
Come on.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.040
You can do it.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.308
Don't be scared.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.942
Come on.

14:07.546 --> 14:10.014
Oh, just pet the bird,
you big baby!

14:16.356 --> 14:17.356
(gasps)

14:17.358 --> 14:19.091
I did it!

14:20.861 --> 14:23.029
I actually did it.

14:23.031 --> 14:25.365
Okay, now flush him.

14:27.468 --> 14:30.436
So, Leonard,
what do you do for fun?

14:30.438 --> 14:32.504
I'm... let's see.

14:32.506 --> 14:34.706
Hiking.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.875
Karaoke in Koreatown.

14:38.943 --> 14:41.144
Any Jennifer Aniston movie.

14:41.979 --> 14:44.380
Hey. Sorry I ditched you.

14:44.382 --> 14:45.781
- No, it's fine. You can ditch away.
- Oh, no, no.

14:45.783 --> 14:47.583
We said we were going to
hang out, let's hang out.

14:47.585 --> 14:49.384
It's cool.
Go back to Kevin.

14:49.386 --> 14:51.053
Oh, he had to leave.

14:51.055 --> 14:52.454
Interesting.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.857
So now that he's gone,
you want to hang out with me.

14:54.859 --> 14:56.458
- This must be Penny.
- Yep.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.827
I totally get it.

15:01.665 --> 15:03.599
Huh? I'm sorry, get what?

15:03.601 --> 15:05.334
Don't worry about it. You know,
there's some guys over there.

15:05.336 --> 15:06.469
You should go talk to them.

15:06.471 --> 15:08.405
No, no. I want to
know what you told her.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.607
That's kind of
between me and...

15:10.609 --> 15:12.609
- Laura.
- Laura.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.144
Oh. Okay, I see.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.413
So while he was telling
you things, did he mention

15:16.415 --> 15:19.449
he owns, not one,
but two Star Trek uniforms?

15:19.451 --> 15:21.585
- Really?
- Yeah. Wears them.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.988
Not just for Halloween.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.425
Hey, pal.

15:28.727 --> 15:31.329
You didn't see me telling
Kevin that you thought

15:31.331 --> 15:34.566
cold wars were only
fought in winter.

15:34.568 --> 15:38.402
Okay. Then I'll return the
favor, and I won't tell...

15:38.404 --> 15:39.771
- Laura.
- ...Laura

15:39.773 --> 15:44.108
that half the dirty movies
you own are animated.

15:48.013 --> 15:51.315
When you were telling Kevin
about your acting career,

15:51.317 --> 15:54.185
did you mention your
long-running role as "Waitress"

15:54.187 --> 15:57.454
in a local production of
<i>The Cheesecake Factory?</i>

15:57.456 --> 16:01.057
Did you tell her about
your lucky asthma inhaler?

16:01.993 --> 16:04.594
Oh, yeah? Spell "asthma."

16:06.663 --> 16:08.965
A-s...

16:08.967 --> 16:11.067
Take me home.

16:11.069 --> 16:13.036
Maybe I'm not done
hanging out with...

16:16.073 --> 16:17.373
You're right,
it's getting late.

16:23.914 --> 16:25.781
It's remarkable.

16:25.783 --> 16:28.117
All that time spent in fear.

16:28.119 --> 16:29.985
And for what?

16:29.987 --> 16:32.755
He's magnificent.

16:32.757 --> 16:33.722
(gasps)

16:33.724 --> 16:35.024
Oh, dear.

16:35.026 --> 16:37.726
I just realized I haven't
offered you a beverage.

16:43.500 --> 16:47.970
Oh, it's just like my grandma
with her parrot.

16:47.972 --> 16:51.640
And after she lost her marbles
with her remote control.

16:52.775 --> 16:56.011
My phone's on the desk
over there.

16:56.013 --> 16:57.945
Take a picture of us together.

16:57.947 --> 17:00.080
Make it good enough
to go on a mug,

17:00.082 --> 17:02.015
a mouse pad, and a calendar.

17:07.588 --> 17:10.222
If you were a dove,
I'd call you Lovey-Dovey.

17:10.223 --> 17:12.290
Oh. Who am I kidding?

17:12.292 --> 17:14.526
This isn't a moment for strict
adherence to the literal.

17:14.528 --> 17:17.630
You're just my little
Lovey-Dovey, aren't you?

17:19.065 --> 17:20.299
Guess you gotta
have hollow bones

17:20.300 --> 17:22.501
to get some sugar around here.

17:24.637 --> 17:27.839
I still think he looks
like someone's pet.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.807
Maybe we should put up posters.

17:29.809 --> 17:32.242
Yes. It should have
a big picture of him,

17:32.244 --> 17:36.712
and the words, "Is this
your bird? Not anymore."

17:38.181 --> 17:40.582
We're going to have
so much fun together.

17:40.584 --> 17:43.318
You can carry messages
to all my enemies.

17:44.620 --> 17:48.790
I can tie a string to your leg
and fly you like a kite.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.892
If you're keeping him,
I've got a cage you can borrow.

17:50.894 --> 17:52.960
One of the test monkeys
slipped on a banana peel

17:52.962 --> 17:54.195
and broke his neck.

17:55.631 --> 17:58.867
It was both tragic
and hysterical.

18:01.237 --> 18:02.538
Nonsense.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.641
No. Lovey-Dovey doesn't
sleep in a cage.

18:05.643 --> 18:09.411
No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps
in his very own nest,

18:09.413 --> 18:11.513
which I'm going to get
off the windowsill

18:11.515 --> 18:12.981
and put in my room.

18:12.983 --> 18:15.483
Isn't that right, LD?

18:19.621 --> 18:20.888
No.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.556
Where are you going?

18:22.558 --> 18:24.624
Come back, Lovey-Dovey!

18:24.626 --> 18:26.226
This is your home now!

18:26.228 --> 18:30.931
I already ordered 20 pounds
of bird feed off of Amazon!

18:32.200 --> 18:33.267
He's gone.

18:33.269 --> 18:35.536
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

18:35.538 --> 18:37.671
How could he do this to me?

18:37.673 --> 18:41.843
Get back here, you stupid bird,
so I can love you!

19:08.619 --> 19:10.787
(sighs)

19:18.296 --> 19:20.731
(sighs)

19:20.733 --> 19:23.233
Okay. So...
we went out,

19:23.235 --> 19:25.936
saw a movie,
met some nice people,

19:25.938 --> 19:28.272
said horrible things
about each other in public...

19:28.274 --> 19:30.440
all in all,
a pretty magical night.

19:31.276 --> 19:32.710
Okay, I'm not innocent
in all this,

19:32.712 --> 19:37.315
but you basically called me
stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.

19:37.317 --> 19:40.518
I know, I-I-I crossed a line.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.253
And I'm sorry.

19:42.255 --> 19:44.389
No, no, no, hang on.
I really mean it.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.892
And it's not like when we were
going out, I'd just apologize

19:46.894 --> 19:49.429
for everything
so we could end up in bed.

19:50.831 --> 19:52.332
This is a 100%

19:52.334 --> 19:55.135
sex-is-off-the-table
"I'm sorry."

19:55.137 --> 19:57.370
(sighs) All right. Thank you.

19:57.372 --> 19:58.471
I'm sorry, too.

19:58.473 --> 20:02.476
Just to be clear,
sex is off the table, right?

20:02.478 --> 20:05.212
Way off.

20:05.214 --> 20:09.282
Maybe we're not ready
to hang out as friends.

20:09.284 --> 20:11.618
I don't know.
Up until the last part,

20:11.620 --> 20:13.720
I was kind of enjoying
take-charge Leonard

20:13.722 --> 20:14.821
with a little backbone.

20:14.823 --> 20:17.424
Picking the movie,
knowing what he wants,

20:17.426 --> 20:19.125
a little cocky.

20:19.127 --> 20:20.761
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:20.763 --> 20:25.233
Well, then, I'm putting
sex back on the table.

20:27.069 --> 20:30.339
What do you think about that?

20:30.341 --> 20:32.107
Ooh. Maybe I like it.

20:32.109 --> 20:34.476
You do? Because if that's what
you like, I can be that guy.

20:34.478 --> 20:36.378
I swear, I'll be anything
you want me to be.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.547
Good night, Leonard.

20:41.351 --> 20:43.218
(door slams)

20:43.220 --> 20:46.722
I am such an asthmatic dumbass.

20:48.224 --> 20:50.025
I had a weird night.

20:50.213 --> 20:52.220
Mine was great.

20:52.221 --> 20:54.789
I'm going to be a mommy.
