00:07.155 --> 00:09.478
My name is Melinda Gordon.

00:09.773 --> 00:12.359
I'm married,
I live in a small town,

00:13.502 --> 00:15.216
and I own
an antique shop.

00:15.241 --> 00:17.205
I might be just like you.

00:17.235 --> 00:21.623
Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:22.591 --> 00:25.581
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:26.211 --> 00:28.683
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:28.718 --> 00:31.091
and they come to me
for help.

00:34.025 --> 00:39.263
In order to tell you my
story, I have to tell you theirs.

00:40.932 --> 00:42.837
<i>Previously
on ghost whisperer...</i>

00:42.837 --> 00:45.233
there's a plane in the air...

00:45.256 --> 00:47.533
no one is flying it!

00:51.495 --> 00:54.812
Yeah, I really don't get the feeling
that he was on that flight.

00:54.818 --> 00:55.562
I mean, what are the chances?

00:55.595 --> 00:57.542
I can't lose
my brother, melinda.

00:58.896 --> 01:01.962
- Wait!
- They're mine.

01:09.698 --> 01:13.431
I've been trying to work up
the courage to go in there,

01:14.147 --> 01:16.581
- look at the passenger list.
- Andrea...

01:16.596 --> 01:18.601
there's
something I have to tell you.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.630
- You saw mitch.
- Andrea--

01:20.637 --> 01:24.393
- Don't! No. No.
- But I'm not sure--

01:24.395 --> 01:26.392
no way.
It's not him.

01:26.408 --> 01:28.501
It was 250 people, jim.

01:28.747 --> 01:30.763
Do I really have
the right to ignore that?

01:30.767 --> 01:34.041
What about the thousands people
you could help the rest of your life?

01:34.046 --> 01:36.693
You can't trick those souls
into staying here.

01:36.696 --> 01:40.780
I will release
all your precious souls.

01:40.817 --> 01:44.550
And in return,
I'll take...you.

01:44.965 --> 01:47.251
Mitch!

01:52.587 --> 01:56.003
- Mitch?
- I'm so sorry, Mitch.

01:56.006 --> 01:58.142
I was supposed
to be on that plane, Melinda,

01:58.148 --> 02:00.140
I can't believe Andrea
it's dead.

02:00.648 --> 02:01.941
How'd it happen?

02:01.947 --> 02:05.720
She was driving
to your apartment in the city.

02:06.498 --> 02:08.911
She tried so hard
to reach you.

02:09.407 --> 02:12.501
I guess her car got caught in the
path of the plane.

02:12.505 --> 02:15.973
- Do you think she suffered?
- No.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.561
No, I don't think so.

02:21.718 --> 02:23.911
This can't be happening!

02:27.778 --> 02:30.831
she's mine!

02:53.867 --> 02:58.931
- Andrea! Andrea!
- Melinda, I don't know what's happening!

02:58.936 --> 03:01.261
- Please, help me!
- I've been looking for you, where are you?

03:01.305 --> 03:03.412
At the store.
I'm so scared!

03:03.416 --> 03:06.341
- Well, can you get to my house?
- I don't know!

03:06.348 --> 03:10.811
Ok. I'll come to you.
I have really good news.

03:10.835 --> 03:12.910
Hello?!

03:12.915 --> 03:14.882
How is she calling you?

03:15.038 --> 03:18.500
She had her cell phone with her. You know,
maybe she can tap into the energy fields.

03:18.665 --> 03:21.260
- I'll come with you?
- No, she's gonna want to talk to me alone.

03:21.306 --> 03:25.192
She's gonna be so happy!

03:43.537 --> 03:45.770
Don't!

03:46.455 --> 03:48.691
The light hurts my eyes.

03:50.868 --> 03:53.772
Andrea, I've been
so worried about you!

03:53.778 --> 03:57.371
- Tell me everything's gonna be ok.
- I think maybe it is.

03:57.376 --> 03:59.931
You may not really be dead.

04:00.085 --> 04:02.082
- What?
- It's truim found you,

04:02.088 --> 04:04.033
Jim found you,
your body.

04:04.037 --> 04:07.312
You're in a coma at mercy hospital,
but you're gonna be ok.

04:07.347 --> 04:11.153
You're just out of body until ypu come out
of the coma. Doctors are working so hard.

04:11.246 --> 04:14.753
You're not lying to me? You're not just
trying to make me feel better?

04:14.775 --> 04:17.773
Look, you're not out of the woods.
You have some injuries.

04:17.778 --> 04:20.050
but the doctors think that
you're gonna pull through.

04:20.616 --> 04:23.903
We've been with you
at that hospital every day.

04:24.008 --> 04:28.012
- It's scary here.
- What's it like?

04:28.027 --> 04:32.042
I don't really like to look around too
much. There...there are people here.

04:32.045 --> 04:34.301
- People?
- Not people...

04:34.676 --> 04:39.931
I guess, maybe, um, beings or something?
They're dark, and they're always watching.

04:45.247 --> 04:48.300
- I can't really see.
- Melinda!

04:48.636 --> 04:50.942
Melinda... Open the door!

04:50.946 --> 04:54.500
- Open the door, let me in!
- I can't!

04:54.517 --> 04:56.833
- The door!
- It won't open!

04:58.167 --> 05:01.142
Andrea!...
No... No!

05:01.146 --> 05:03.941
- No!
- It's ok, it's ok.

05:03.947 --> 05:06.461
- Shh, just a dream.
- Sorry.

05:07.305 --> 05:09.390
Want some water?

05:10.047 --> 05:12.080
I dreamt
that she was alive,

05:12.608 --> 05:16.151
that you found her body
and that she was gonna be ok.

05:16.527 --> 05:19.231
Think she's trying
to come to you in the dreams?

05:19.237 --> 05:22.721
It doesn't usually work that way.
Scared the hell out of me, though.

05:22.797 --> 05:24.200
No kidding.

05:24.405 --> 05:27.073
- Sorry I woke you.
- Yeah, me, too.

05:27.078 --> 05:31.572
I was dreaming that I was floating on
a river of beer and I had a big cup.

05:31.666 --> 05:34.123
Are your dreams
always that complex?

05:34.138 --> 05:36.281
Pretty much.

05:37.085 --> 05:38.313
Gonna be able to sleep?

05:38.385 --> 05:43.162
I don't want to keep you up. You know what,
I think I'm just gonna go downstairs and read.

05:55.205 --> 05:57.202
Romano.

05:57.207 --> 05:59.642
Mine.

06:02.847 --> 06:06.293
Help me.

06:44.657 --> 06:48.270
Death is nothing at all.
It does not count.

06:48.518 --> 06:51.521
I have only slipped away
into the next room.

06:51.565 --> 06:54.060
Everything remains
as it was.

06:54.336 --> 06:57.712
The old life that we live so fondly
together in unchanged.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.840
Is andrea here?

06:59.848 --> 07:04.272
Whatever we were
to each other, that we are still.

07:05.537 --> 07:10.561
- I am but waiting for you. For an inverval,
interval, somewhere very near... - No.

07:10.565 --> 07:15.171
I just don't understand why
she's not coming to me.

07:15.175 --> 07:17.561
- Maybe she's crossed over.
- No, she hasn'T.

07:17.566 --> 07:19.722
I would know if she did.

07:19.728 --> 07:22.000
I just can't figure out
what's keeping her here.

07:22.007 --> 07:27.310
...How we shall laugh at the trouble
of parting when we meet again.

07:27.317 --> 07:31.312
Maybe she's still in the department.
I will be going to see later

07:47.747 --> 07:49.801
Thanks for everything
you did, melinda.

07:50.786 --> 07:55.132
I hope you know
how much andrea loved you.

07:55.136 --> 07:57.870
I loved her, too. So much.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.310
You were like her sister.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.283
Do you ever...feel like
she's with you??

08:06.285 --> 08:09.131
In some ways, you know,
like she's near you?

08:09.135 --> 08:11.501
No. Not really.

08:12.607 --> 08:14.681
Do you?

08:14.685 --> 08:17.652
I'd like to.

08:17.658 --> 08:22.462
Andrea said that you understood death
in ways that most people don'T.

08:23.297 --> 08:25.292
What else
did she say?

08:25.296 --> 08:29.830
Just that you knew
how to help people who were grieving.

08:30.675 --> 08:33.150
Now I'm one of them.

08:35.626 --> 08:37.751
We both lost a sister.

08:44.238 --> 08:46.322
Here in the stricken
town of grandview,

08:46.327 --> 08:48.592
residents struggle to resume
their normal lives

08:48.595 --> 08:51.553
after the tragedy
of flight 395.

08:51.555 --> 08:53.821
We're here today to see
how they're doing. Excuse me,

08:53.826 --> 08:57.261
We're here in grandview today to see
what kind of progress the town is making

08:57.266 --> 08:59.051
in the aftermath
of the plane crash.

08:59.086 --> 09:01.301
How do you think
things are going?

09:02.138 --> 09:05.191
Um...I can only say that the people
in this town are really strong,

09:05.335 --> 09:07.121
they're survivors.

09:07.166 --> 09:09.612
- We're gonna be ok.
- Thank you.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.470
Well, there you have it
from a local merchant.

09:12.476 --> 09:16.382
This town is grieving, but determined
to get back to business as usual.

09:27.986 --> 09:31.081
Andrea?...
Are you here?

09:33.955 --> 09:36.712
I just want
to talk to you, please.

09:36.716 --> 09:39.342
I know that you're scared.

10:34.268 --> 10:37.471
- Where's andrea?
- I'll be glad to take a message.

10:37.476 --> 10:41.252
- What are you doing to her?
- I don't have to do anything.

10:41.257 --> 10:44.333
- She's doing it all to herself.
- Who are you?

10:44.338 --> 10:47.341
I was alive once.
Just like you.

10:47.346 --> 10:51.380
- ...I had names, I had lis.
- Romano... Is that your name?

10:51.385 --> 10:53.561
- I'm just a humble teacher.
- Teacher?

10:53.565 --> 10:56.152
Trying to spread the word.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.643
- Much like yourself.
- What are you doing here? What do you want?

10:59.648 --> 11:01.932
- I have what I want.
- No. No, you don'T.

11:01.938 --> 11:06.311
Andrea will not go with you. I
know her. She's going into the light.

11:06.377 --> 11:09.802
I'm going to have her,
and I'm going to have you, too.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.819
It's just a matter of time.

12:16.327 --> 12:19.373
Andrea, you have to cross
over. Please let me help you.

12:19.376 --> 12:23.333
- I can'T. - Why not?
- You could never understand why!

12:36.797 --> 12:40.530
<i>Cloudy and cold in the seattle area
tonight. Possible showers tomorrow,</i>

12:40.537 --> 12:43.470
<i>but the rest of the week
looks like we might see some sunshine.</i>

12:43.476 --> 12:46.910
<i>In other news across the nation,
the small east coast town of grandview</i>

12:46.918 --> 12:49.672
<i>is still recovering from
that tragic plane crash.</i>

12:49.678 --> 12:56.031
<i>Um, all I can say is that people in
this town are strong. They're survivors,</i>

12:56.047 --> 12:58.310
<i>and we'll be ok.</i>

12:58.318 --> 13:00.423
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:00.426 --> 13:02.882
Melinda...

13:07.317 --> 13:10.831
That brings us back
to the power of the mind.

13:11.036 --> 13:15.420
Something so powerful that it creates
that which we want to be true.

13:15.426 --> 13:17.551
That's why athletes are taught
visualization techniques

13:17.558 --> 13:20.653
because if you imagine it,
it will happen.

13:20.658 --> 13:23.372
Now, how do we extrapolate this
theory to the world of the supernatural?

13:23.375 --> 13:26.430
Specters, demon n tities,
poltergeists, hauntings.

13:26.478 --> 13:29.250
Well, what do we do? We say that all
these things are complete bull,

13:29.267 --> 13:32.061
or they're all explainable
in some way or another.

13:32.066 --> 13:34.250
Now, my question
to you is this--

13:34.258 --> 13:38.310
could it be all of these phenomena
are just an extension of brain function,

13:38.358 --> 13:43.331
an extension of our collective minds
creating myths, filling in the blanks,

13:43.346 --> 13:46.990
if you will... And that is what we will
be studying in this class.

13:46.997 --> 13:48.992
Professor payne,
hi, I'm melinda gordon.

13:49.005 --> 13:51.592
- Good for you.
- No, we spoke on the phone, remember?

13:51.635 --> 13:53.721
- About what?
- I read about your work.

13:53.726 --> 13:55.722
- Why?
- I need some help.

13:55.725 --> 13:57.311
I need a lot of help, too, more
than you can imagine,

13:57.316 --> 13:59.271
but I don't come to your
workplace and ask for it, do I?

13:59.316 --> 14:02.072
Look, you're supposed to be the
expert on the history and beliefs

14:02.088 --> 14:03.421
of the occult and the supernatural--

14:03.466 --> 14:06.320
As it pertains to contemporary
psychology. If you want to find

14:06.325 --> 14:07.742
your dead aunt's will,
I can't help you.

14:07.776 --> 14:11.180
- Is it necessary to be this rude?
- Necessary, no. Amusing, always.

14:11.187 --> 14:13.183
Hey, you're the go-to guy,
and I need somebody to go to.

14:13.188 --> 14:14.191
They say
you're a genius.

14:14.196 --> 14:16.221
I can't believe you can't spare
half an hour!

14:16.228 --> 14:18.680
Makes me crazy the way they throw the
word "genius" around, all right?

14:18.696 --> 14:22.111
Although, coming from you,
it does give me a certain tingle.

14:22.146 --> 14:24.143
- Will you buy me food?
- Yes.

14:24.148 --> 14:26.752
- Follow me.
- Great!

14:27.276 --> 14:29.430
I don't teach
the supernatural.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.913
I teach society's need to believe
in the supernatural,

14:32.915 --> 14:35.842
the myths and the legends
throughout the ages.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.802
There are lots of myths about
dark spirits and light spirits.

14:38.807 --> 14:40.652
I'm just trying to
find out more about them.

14:40.685 --> 14:42.863
- Why?
- Because I really need to.

14:43.455 --> 14:45.520
Well, most cultures
favor the same motifs.

14:45.525 --> 14:49.351
Basically, it's demons, dark entities,
shadows, phantoms.

14:49.357 --> 14:53.231
You know, the relationship between
good and evil has always been symbiotic.

14:53.246 --> 14:55.800
You can't have one without the
other... And speaking of evil,

14:55.805 --> 14:58.772
- don't try that shrimp.
- What function do they serve?

14:58.775 --> 15:02.142
- Apparently to make us violently ill.
- Are you still talking about the shrimp?

15:02.325 --> 15:05.542
- Aren't you?
- Spirits, dark spirits.

15:05.545 --> 15:08.133
Dark spirits. Dark spirits and
light spirits are linked--

15:08.665 --> 15:12.262
at opposite ends, obviously, and the
dark spirits are here to create evil,

15:12.265 --> 15:14.093
not only create evil but to grow it.

15:14.138 --> 15:15.370
And the light spirits?

15:15.376 --> 15:18.750
The light spirits make sure that
the dead pass on to the other side.

15:18.788 --> 15:20.463
The light, heaven,
whatever you want to call it.

15:20.466 --> 15:22.462
They're the protectors
of the souls.

15:22.468 --> 15:25.461
They, uh, they just go
around spreading all things good.

15:25.476 --> 15:27.732
Love, happiness,
blah blah blah.

15:27.766 --> 15:30.821
And can one dark spirit become
more powerful than the others?

15:31.415 --> 15:33.502
Well, that depends on how many
souls they can take up,

15:33.547 --> 15:36.383
and that's why the dark spirits
hate the light spirits so much,

15:36.387 --> 15:40.712
because the light spirits are always
taking souls away from them.

15:40.808 --> 15:43.633
Well, uh, there's
an east african version

15:43.636 --> 15:47.080
where if a dark spirit can take over
the soul of a light spirit,

15:47.086 --> 15:48.791
that's like triple bonus
points right there.

15:48.838 --> 15:54.733
By engulfing the soul of a light spirit,
the dark spirit becomes invincible.

15:55.328 --> 15:57.482
- You ok?
- Yeah. Have you ever...

15:57.497 --> 16:00.402
come across this image?

16:01.507 --> 16:05.060
- Heh, a villain from old-time radio?
- That's not funny.

16:05.246 --> 16:08.770
- Do we have a name?
- Romano, maybe, I'm not sure.

16:08.778 --> 16:11.702
Ok. Is your romano
a dark spirit or a light spirit?

16:11.706 --> 16:14.450
Oh, you're right. They are too careless
with the word "genius."

16:14.455 --> 16:16.510
That's harsh.
Who are you again?

16:16.515 --> 16:20.621
Just someone who wants some help.
Someone who needs to learn.

16:20.627 --> 16:25.002
- Can you just check the sketch for me?
- I'm already on it. Good-bye.

16:29.247 --> 16:33.460
I'm just not sure what you hope to
get talkin' to this professor guy.

16:33.498 --> 16:36.921
I'm not exactly sure, either, but at
least, if I can find out who this romano is,

16:36.925 --> 16:39.033
then I can keep her
away from him.

16:39.037 --> 16:41.313
Does he know what you can do?
The professor.

16:43.348 --> 16:45.533
- Why don't you tell him?
- I don't tell people.

16:45.537 --> 16:48.762
- You told andrea.
- Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have.

16:48.955 --> 16:52.452
Maybe this whole spirit thing evaded
her life just as it has ours.

16:52.456 --> 16:55.891
Maybe she would have been
better off not even knowing.

16:55.928 --> 17:00.823
Hey. Slow down. You gotta realize you're
hurting, too. You've been through...

17:01.607 --> 17:03.872
a terrible shock.
Take a beat.

17:03.907 --> 17:05.262
Yeah, I can'T.

17:05.268 --> 17:08.910
- Why? - Because, if I stop
and think, I just feel so guilty.

17:09.405 --> 17:12.000
You know, like maybe
what happened to andrea is my fault.

17:12.318 --> 17:14.381
I mean, it's only because of me that
she knew about the plane.

17:14.387 --> 17:17.060
It's only because
of me that romano went looking for her.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.073
Maybe...

17:19.078 --> 17:22.463
Maybe... I unleashed something
that even I don't understand.

17:22.465 --> 17:24.640
Just do the best you can
do with what you know.

17:24.647 --> 17:26.781
I can't believe
that she's gone.

17:27.785 --> 17:31.611
I can't believe that she's not gonna
walk in this door at any minute

17:31.615 --> 17:34.533
with her coffee and a joke.

17:35.587 --> 17:40.351
I would give anything just to hear
her laugh one more time.

17:42.056 --> 17:44.980
She never doubted me.

17:45.647 --> 17:50.483
- Even for a minute. - Ok, there's
something that you should know about me.

17:52.446 --> 17:56.203
- Ooh, uh-oh.
- Yeah. And it's gonna sound crazy.

17:56.206 --> 17:58.200
And I'm telling you
for 2 reasons.

17:58.206 --> 18:02.873
One, because I have a good feeling about
ypu. You don't seem like you're judgmental.

18:02.877 --> 18:06.220
- Ok...
- ok, so here it is.

18:07.038 --> 18:12.901
Uh, sometimes when people
die, their spirits don't leave.

18:12.907 --> 18:15.613
They stay earthbound
for all kinds of reasons.

18:18.797 --> 18:23.611
And, well... I can see those people.
Those...spirits.

18:23.616 --> 18:26.392
They talk to me,
I can help them.

18:28.118 --> 18:30.780
You should say
something soon.

18:32.568 --> 18:36.101
That...is... the...

18:37.537 --> 18:42.551
-... coolest thing I've ever heard.
- You don't think I'm nuts?

18:42.556 --> 18:47.921
Ooh, ahh, no more nuts
than I am.

18:47.935 --> 18:50.153
I mean, I buy it. I like it.
I knew you'd get it, I just knew it.

18:50.158 --> 18:53.762
Yeah, but you said there was another
reason that you were telling me.

18:53.767 --> 18:57.103
Yeah, you have a ghost
attached to you.

18:57.106 --> 19:00.563
I'm sorry, what?
What--where? Where?

19:02.296 --> 19:05.262
I thought you could see me!

19:05.266 --> 19:09.240
He's, uh, behind you. He's been
following you for the last 2 weeks.

19:09.247 --> 19:11.610
What--why?
What does he want?

19:12.238 --> 19:15.382
Finally!
Ok, it's like this all right--

19:15.388 --> 19:19.110
you don't have to shout! Just because you're
dead doesn't mean that I can't hear you.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.602
All right, all right, what do I know?
I thought I was talking

19:21.606 --> 19:23.243
from the great beyond or something.

19:23.266 --> 19:27.391
Anyway, the point is, I used to live
in the apartment she lives in now.

19:27.408 --> 19:31.062
Ah, he's an older man who used to live
in your apartment.

19:31.506 --> 19:33.960
Ok, please tell me he didn't die
in my apartment.

19:33.968 --> 19:38.051
I didn't die there. I crapped out on
a bus one day coming home.

19:38.057 --> 19:42.093
Heart attack.
But I digress. The point is this.

19:42.095 --> 19:47.561
There's a stack of pictures of my
grandson that fell behind the stove,

19:47.565 --> 19:52.460
and I never got around to gettin' them out,
and my daughter would love those shots.

19:52.475 --> 19:55.383
Oh, there's pictures of his grandson
behind your stove.

19:55.386 --> 19:58.883
My daughter's name is nancy howard.
She's in the phone book.

19:58.888 --> 20:00.870
He wants you to send the pictures
to his daughter. I have her name.

20:00.878 --> 20:02.510
She's in the phone book.

20:07.655 --> 20:09.951
Hey, you're kidding, right?

20:13.575 --> 20:16.992
Ok, I am so gonna
love this job.

20:35.857 --> 20:38.161
Andrea?

20:52.457 --> 20:55.482
Got here about
a half hour ago.

20:55.485 --> 20:57.783
My key won't turn in the lock.
I knock, but no one answers.

21:01.357 --> 21:03.833
Hello? Who's in there?

21:06.645 --> 21:08.682
Try your key again.

22:04.225 --> 22:06.221
Who could have
done that?

22:06.226 --> 22:08.620
That's sick.
I don't get it.

22:08.625 --> 22:13.441
The words... that name, romano.
I have no idea who that is, do you?

22:13.717 --> 22:17.793
- Everything just seems a bit crazy right now.
- Should I call the police?

22:17.795 --> 22:21.783
- If it'll make you feel better, but I don't--
- Melinda, if you know something,

22:21.785 --> 22:23.203
please, tell me.

22:23.977 --> 22:26.623
I really don't know
what's going on.

22:27.147 --> 22:29.203
You feel like you
could know a person...

22:30.226 --> 22:32.802
I mean, really know who they
are through and through?

22:32.838 --> 22:34.850
- I do.
- I do, too.

22:34.856 --> 22:37.951
And I know my sister.
I know it sounds crazy,

22:37.958 --> 22:42.720
but I feel like something's wrong.
Like she's not at rest somehow.

22:43.288 --> 22:45.383
I can't shake it.

22:47.737 --> 22:51.041
You probably know things weren't
always great with us.

22:51.045 --> 22:53.253
She told me you didn't talk
for 2 years..

22:53.258 --> 22:55.862
It's worse than that.

22:55.876 --> 22:58.413
There's somethin'
I never told her.

22:59.028 --> 23:01.162
Something she should
have known.

23:01.168 --> 23:04.602
- What?
- What difference does it make?

23:05.547 --> 23:08.072
It's too late.

23:14.087 --> 23:18.853
Andrea?
Are you here?

23:28.628 --> 23:30.631
Andrea?

23:32.365 --> 23:35.623
He told me not to believe
a thing you say.

23:35.627 --> 23:37.931
Romano?

23:37.935 --> 23:41.153
I don't want to be dead!
I shouldn't be dead!

23:42.657 --> 23:50.890
Please...help me. I don't want
to be here. But I deserve it.

23:50.937 --> 23:53.680
- No, you don't!
- What'll happen to me if I go with him?

23:53.687 --> 23:57.520
He'll turn you into something,
something just like him.

23:57.526 --> 24:03.052
- He makes me want to be with him!
-Andrea, it's all lies!
Please don't let him do it--

24:03.558 --> 24:06.783
- I have to go.
- Where?

24:06.785 --> 24:07.551
Back to the beginning.
Oh, my god.

24:09.827 --> 24:12.101
Andrea, please!

24:13.668 --> 24:16.982
- I have to go now.
- Andrea!

25:12.626 --> 25:15.940
- Hello.
- Hi, melinda, it's rick payne.

25:15.956 --> 25:18.272
Uh, I just got back
to my office.

25:18.276 --> 25:21.102
Is there any chance you can
come over here? Right away?

25:21.106 --> 25:24.182
Could this wait till morning?
It's been kind of a long night.

25:24.188 --> 25:27.660
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe not.

25:28.655 --> 25:30.832
Ok, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

25:30.838 --> 25:33.100
Is there any chance
you'll pass a noodle parlor?

25:33.107 --> 25:35.333
- None.
- Fair enough.

26:07.266 --> 26:10.071
- when did this happen?
- Today. I'm teaching a class,

26:10.078 --> 26:12.011
and then I go out to
dinner--polynesian food.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.872
Have you ever had tongue
and papaya? I don't recommend it.

26:14.915 --> 26:19.203
I come back to my office to get some
books, and all this has happened.

26:19.295 --> 26:22.191
I--who could have done this?!
Some disgruntled janitor? No. No. No.

26:22.195 --> 26:25.693
Please. I don't think so.
And then--ooh-- check this out.

26:25.697 --> 26:27.780
Here's a drawing that i
didn't even know I had.

26:28.496 --> 26:31.472
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah, sure.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.363
- Well?
- Oh, sorry, uh,

26:34.398 --> 26:38.151
basically it's a warning.
It's a dark motif favored by the incans.

26:38.155 --> 26:42.191
"Back off or die" being
the fundamental message.

26:42.848 --> 26:46.710
Who are you really? Come on, you come here
asking me some very interesting questions.

26:46.725 --> 26:51.280
Next thing I know, my office is redecorated.
And I'm on the wrong end of
an incan death threat.

26:51.287 --> 26:53.771
Look, I'm really am
just kind of a student.

26:53.775 --> 26:56.791
There are some things that I know and
some things that I'm trying to find out.

26:56.795 --> 26:58.791
Ok. That's--
that's great.

26:58.796 --> 27:01.812
But are you going to tell me this all
happened because of a supernatural event?

27:01.857 --> 27:04.693
- Yes.
- Come on! That's crap!

27:04.698 --> 27:07.252
Who--who sent you here?
Who put you up to this?

27:07.258 --> 27:09.163
Is it spiegelman from princeton,
that son of a bitch?

27:09.168 --> 27:11.783
Ok, the sketch that I gave you.
Did you find out anything about him?

27:11.808 --> 27:13.812
Oh, yeah.
I did actually.

27:13.818 --> 27:18.640
There's an obscure sect in algeria,
sort of a quasi devil worship...

27:19.035 --> 27:22.991
sort of a quasi devil worshiping group. They
use this image as the object of their reverence.

27:23.025 --> 27:26.323
I also found another group in morocco,
and there's another one in portugal.

27:26.926 --> 27:29.342
Wow.
This is amazing.

27:29.385 --> 27:32.261
Come here!, you maybe want
to see this.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.692
Is this...

27:38.698 --> 27:41.760
that's an american cult leader living in
Spain-- went by the name romano.

27:41.766 --> 27:44.052
This guy had 115 followers.

27:44.057 --> 27:47.513
And he convinced them all to
commit themselves to their dark sides.

27:47.556 --> 27:51.322
And like you were telling me that dark
spirits like souls to be angry and toxic.

27:51.326 --> 27:55.340
Toxic is an understatement. This guy convinced
these people to commit the ultimate dark act...

27:55.347 --> 27:58.143
That would assure them
a place alongside him in eternity.

27:58.145 --> 28:00.630
- Suicide?
- On a grand scale.

28:00.636 --> 28:03.223
You say you've seen
this guy recently?

28:03.226 --> 28:05.540
- Kinda.
- You know, that's fascinating to me,

28:05.585 --> 28:10.072
this happened in 1939! And romano
killed himself with all the others.

28:10.168 --> 28:12.163
And became
a dark spirit?

28:12.165 --> 28:14.900
Let's say the sake of argument
that dark spirits are real.

28:14.908 --> 28:18.150
I would say your friend romano there
was a dark spirit long before that happened.

28:18.158 --> 28:20.423
- A living one?
- As these entities get stronger,

28:20.458 --> 28:22.772
they have the ability
to take over a weaker human.

28:22.777 --> 28:24.770
Literally take over
their bodies?

28:24.775 --> 28:26.911
In theory-- look, that's a picture of
some loser named romano

28:26.946 --> 28:30.321
with an evil heart and a weak will.,
But once the spirit got ahold of him

28:30.368 --> 28:32.490
all the negative energy
from that mass suicide--

28:32.498 --> 28:37.233
he was 100 times stronger. And then when
he died, he was released back into
the ether badder than ever.

28:37.997 --> 28:40.321
- And now?
- Now...

28:40.748 --> 28:42.831
regrouping
for a bigger bite.

28:42.836 --> 28:46.343
Maybe he's just sucking
up soul after soul and building more

28:46.347 --> 28:48.440
and more strength until the next
human being he takes over

28:48.446 --> 28:49.960
he could do some real
hurt to the world.

28:49.968 --> 28:53.472
And this guy's not gonna stop
until he destroys everything that's good.

28:54.286 --> 28:57.562
- You sound like a believer.
- I'd like to believe.

28:57.575 --> 29:02.060
I'd like to believe there's more than
this short rocket trip to the grave.

29:02.086 --> 29:04.083
I'd like to believe in
an afterlife.

29:05.088 --> 29:08.371
I believe in science. I need proof.
I need facts and figures.

29:08.415 --> 29:10.822
I can't just take it on faith
alone. And there lies the rub.

29:10.826 --> 29:14.721
No faith, no belief.

29:19.517 --> 29:24.273
I--I have
to plan breakfast now.

29:27.055 --> 29:29.922
Um...romano-- he didn't kill
anybody himself, did he?

29:30.335 --> 29:33.613
I mean, he just convinced them
to kill themselves.

29:33.618 --> 29:35.841
That also fits in
with the dark motif.

29:35.847 --> 29:37.831
In order for these things to win,
they have to take over a soul

29:37.845 --> 29:41.463
that acts with its own free will. They
have to cooperate in their own destruction.

30:15.076 --> 30:17.170
Hey, where the hell
have you been, kyle?

30:17.175 --> 30:21.020
- Well, I've been busy.
- I can see.

30:21.027 --> 30:24.593
Man, what's with you
and this chick...melinda?

30:25.085 --> 30:27.391
Like you're obsessed
with her.

30:28.848 --> 30:33.543
She and I--we have some
unfinished business.

30:35.315 --> 30:38.151
So the fact that romano
never physically killed anyone

30:38.167 --> 30:39.840
means that he has less power
than you thought.

30:39.846 --> 30:41.240
Means he has more power.

30:41.345 --> 30:45.922
Imagine being able to convince people--
100 of them-- to kill themselve

30:45.928 --> 30:48.670
- Gets in their heads, huh?
- No, he gets inside their souls.

30:48.676 --> 30:50.972
Makes them feel like
they're worthless, that they're bad.

30:50.976 --> 30:54.193
He poisons their spirits. And the weaker
they get, the stronger he gets.

30:54.547 --> 30:56.570
- He's doing this to andrea?
- Yeah, he's trying.

30:56.585 --> 31:00.300
And it makes me so frustrated, because
she's the only one who can turn him away.

31:00.305 --> 31:02.492
And I have to make her
understand that.

31:04.207 --> 31:06.282
- You don't know where she is?
- She said that she was going

31:06.285 --> 31:09.012
back to the beginning,
but the beginning of what?

31:09.016 --> 31:11.102
Your friendship?
The store?

31:13.135 --> 31:15.212
Wait a minute...

31:15.647 --> 31:20.343
I used to tell andrea all the time that
death isn't the end, it's the beginning.

31:20.807 --> 31:22.810
That's where she is.

31:22.816 --> 31:24.943
She went back
to where she died--

31:24.945 --> 31:26.961
where this began.

32:16.796 --> 32:19.092
- I can't cross over.
- Why not?

32:19.096 --> 32:21.091
Romano said I'd be punished.

32:21.096 --> 32:23.090
- For what?
- That night

32:23.096 --> 32:25.322
when mitch
came to the store

32:25.338 --> 32:27.353
and when you told him
I was dead.

32:28.816 --> 32:33.291
When I realized that was true--
that mitch was alive and I was dead...

32:35.168 --> 32:37.172
for just one minute

32:37.176 --> 32:41.792
I wanted to trade places.
I wanted to live so badly

32:42.027 --> 32:45.892
that I wished it was mitch who had
been killed by the plane and not me.

32:46.807 --> 32:49.060
I prayed for it.

32:49.078 --> 32:51.130
We were all in shock.

32:51.787 --> 32:56.533
But you have to talk to mitch. And he has
something that he has to say to you, too.

32:56.536 --> 33:01.380
My own brother,
and I wished him dead!

33:02.627 --> 33:05.001
I can't be forgiven for that.

33:05.006 --> 33:08.620
- Yes, you can.
- I don't want to be.

33:30.845 --> 33:34.792
I know you're packing,
but, I have to talk to you.

33:39.906 --> 33:41.950
I know this is a lot
to take in.

33:41.958 --> 33:44.891
- Ahh, you think?
- You tell me how well you know andrea.

33:44.897 --> 33:48.891
That she's not at rest, that
something's wrong. You can feel it.

33:49.097 --> 33:53.973
Did andrea know about this? That
you could... that you see the dead?

33:53.976 --> 33:57.212
Yes. I used to talk to her
about it all the time.

33:57.218 --> 33:59.402
I can't believe she never
said anything to you.

33:59.447 --> 34:01.300
- Did she believe you?
- Yes.

34:01.897 --> 34:04.581
She was so open
and curious.

34:05.566 --> 34:08.621
She had lots of questions,
always wanted to know more.

34:11.715 --> 34:15.311
That night...
in front of the store,

34:15.317 --> 34:17.951
when I saw you and you told me
what happened to andrea.

34:17.958 --> 34:20.370
Are you saying
that andrea was there?

34:20.558 --> 34:24.159
That you saw her? She
saw us, and she couldn't--

34:24.167 --> 34:26.862
she couldn't let me
know she was there?

34:26.895 --> 34:28.992
She was confused, mitch.

34:28.996 --> 34:32.663
She thought that you were the one that
was dead. It was hard for all of us.

34:32.667 --> 34:34.763
She's in a bad place.

34:34.766 --> 34:38.601
She can't cross over
into the light, and you're the reason.

34:38.617 --> 34:42.670
You have one last chance to do
something good for your sister.

34:50.146 --> 34:54.190
There's a lot of her in this place.
It'll help us to be here.

35:04.076 --> 35:06.080
So...how do we..

35:06.635 --> 35:10.780
- what am i supposed to do? - The best
way is tell me something about andrea.

35:10.787 --> 35:13.071
Just tell me a story.

35:18.978 --> 35:22.322
she was traveling
all the time,

35:22.677 --> 35:27.433
always away and never too good
about being in touch.

35:28.657 --> 35:31.901
My father was sick,
and it got bad real fast.

35:32.436 --> 35:35.551
And I think my dad was hanging on
so he could see her one more time.

35:36.115 --> 35:37.672
But we couldn't find her.

35:39.336 --> 35:41.762
I was with my pop
the night he died.

35:42.307 --> 35:46.482
He knew andrea would be heartbroken
about not being with him...

35:46.486 --> 35:49.102
how guilty she'd feel.

35:50.596 --> 35:54.071
And he wanted me to tell her
that it was all right,

35:54.358 --> 35:57.640
that he loved her,
and that he knew she loved him.

35:58.248 --> 36:00.130
And that he'd see her again.

36:02.718 --> 36:05.160
He didn't want her
to hurt.

36:05.167 --> 36:07.811
You never told me that.

36:09.037 --> 36:11.122
She's here, mitch

36:13.247 --> 36:15.293
Now?

36:15.335 --> 36:17.333
In here with us?

36:17.397 --> 36:20.680
She wants to know why you never
told her what your father said.

36:21.548 --> 36:25.300
Because I was so mad
about her not being there.

36:25.315 --> 36:30.330
And I know it's wrong. And I'm sorry.
I was going to tell her someday.

36:30.335 --> 36:32.380
I just--I never thought
it would be too late.

36:33.506 --> 36:35.751
Will you tell him, melinda?

36:38.448 --> 36:42.071
Mitch, the night that you came
to the store, andrea was there.

36:42.567 --> 36:45.811
She was watching when I told
you that she was dead.

36:45.957 --> 36:50.831
And for a moment, when she realized the
truth she wanted to change places with you.

36:50.837 --> 36:54.323
She wanted to be the one who was alive even if
it meant that you were the one that was dead.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.581
It was only for a split second.

36:56.588 --> 36:59.120
And she feels
full of shame about that.

37:01.795 --> 37:05.742
It's part of what's keeping her here.
She needs your forgiveness.

37:10.098 --> 37:12.402
- Tell her I--
- she can hear you.

37:14.988 --> 37:17.212
Andrea...

37:17.215 --> 37:22.851
I wished the same thing.
I wanted it to be me on that plane,

37:22.857 --> 37:25.511
and you still safe--

37:25.558 --> 37:27.793
still alive.

37:28.018 --> 37:31.631
I mean you were always
the one who lived.

37:32.096 --> 37:36.431
I was always so cautious,
and so worried about the rules.

37:36.436 --> 37:38.522
And what people think...

37:39.288 --> 37:46.333
you always charged ahead. You're the
one who should have gotten more life.

37:47.078 --> 37:49.663
She needs to hear you say
that you forgive her.

37:49.667 --> 37:54.532
There's nothing to forgive.
She didn't do anything wrong.

38:00.777 --> 38:03.363
Can you forgive me?

38:06.668 --> 38:09.912
Let's just say we're even.

38:10.658 --> 38:13.932
She says you're even now.

38:26.677 --> 38:29.023
He says I'll be judged
in the light.

38:29.026 --> 38:33.493
Don't be scared.
Don't let him into your head.

38:38.106 --> 38:40.970
Why isn't he coming inside?

38:40.978 --> 38:43.012
He can't now.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.272
There's too much love
in here.

38:45.275 --> 38:48.273
And that's what's in
the light, not judgment.

38:51.268 --> 38:54.001
Look, we all feel guilt
about what happened that night.

38:54.167 --> 38:58.210
But it's time that we let it go.
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

39:00.386 --> 39:02.380
I'm scared.

39:02.386 --> 39:04.380
I know you are.

39:04.548 --> 39:08.541
Just try and remember l the good
things that you're leaving us with.

39:08.546 --> 39:12.422
Remember that every person
that knew you is better for it...

39:12.435 --> 39:14.960
especially me.

39:15.638 --> 39:17.730
You taught me
to be fearless.

39:18.387 --> 39:20.450
And you loved really well,

39:20.458 --> 39:24.542
and you were loved. And that's what you're
bring into that light, nothing else.

39:30.195 --> 39:32.510
Ahh...I see it.

39:33.736 --> 39:35.791
The light...ohh.

39:41.618 --> 39:45.611
It's more beautiful
than I ever could have imagined.

39:45.628 --> 39:48.122
Then go into it.

39:50.165 --> 39:54.381
You're free.
This is how it's supposed to be.

39:56.005 --> 39:58.763
Melinda...

40:00.276 --> 40:04.900
I'm gonna miss you
so much.

40:04.908 --> 40:07.660
You'll see me again.

40:08.008 --> 40:11.121
And when I get to that light,
you better be waiting.

40:11.156 --> 40:15.040
You better be
the first face that I see.

40:16.348 --> 40:18.960
I'll be waiting.

40:20.257 --> 40:23.381
Good-bye.

40:26.146 --> 40:28.892
Say hi to pop for me.

40:34.116 --> 40:37.502
He says hi back.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.721
She's gone.

41:38.365 --> 41:42.183
Let's see, you're going to driscoll
county, connecting in chicago.

41:42.195 --> 41:45.332
You're all set. Just need
to see a photo I.D.

41:48.457 --> 41:51.791
Oh, shoot. I left
my I.D. In the car.

41:52.345 --> 41:55.753
Got time. Go and get it, and just
come back to the front of the line.
