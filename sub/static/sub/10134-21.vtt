08:13.076 --> 08:14.494
Kimmy, don't touch that.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.497
My dad can tell if you

08:14.535 --> 08:17.497
move anything an inch.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.666
Now I'm just gonna

08:17.538 --> 08:19.666
get a shirt and tie

08:19.707 --> 08:21.835
and we'll be out of here.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.505
Mmm, this one looks good.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.133
And dad's not scheduled

08:25.546 --> 08:28.133
to wear it until..

08:28.175 --> 08:30.593
...next Thursday.

08:30.635 --> 08:34.097
I'm in luck. He has

08:30.635 --> 08:34.097
another one just like it.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.057
Forget it, there's

08:34.139 --> 08:36.057
no way you're going

08:36.099 --> 08:38.393
out of this house

08:36.099 --> 08:38.393
dressed like me.

08:38.435 --> 08:42.105
Did you ever think just maybe

08:38.435 --> 08:42.105
you're the one dressing like me?

08:43.148 --> 08:44.358
- Leave the shirt alone.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.358
- No.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.359
Leave it alone!

08:45.400 --> 08:46.526
[thud]

08:48.320 --> 08:50.613
You're in big trouble, mister.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.493
Look what you did now.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.493
Now get out of my way.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.412
- I have to fix it.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.412
- No, I can fix it myself.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.997
- Let go of it!

08:57.454 --> 08:58.997
- No, you let go.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.208
- I said let go!

08:59.039 --> 09:01.208
- Okay.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.376
[thud]

09:06.546 --> 09:09.299
Well, I can see by

09:06.546 --> 09:09.299
the old hole in the wall

09:09.341 --> 09:11.009
that it's time

09:09.341 --> 09:11.009
for me to go.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.515
You girls will never learn.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.482
We're dead! Dad is

09:23.855 --> 09:25.482
gonna be home any minute.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.025
What are we gonna do?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.610
I know. Let's blame Kimmy!

09:29.652 --> 09:32.489
That won't work.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.489
We have to fix the hole.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.574
Right. We got to fix that hole.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.245
Well, go ahead.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.997
I don't know

09:38.286 --> 09:40.997
how to fix it.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.417
But I know someone who does.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.417
Stephanie, follow me.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.960
What about me?

09:46.002 --> 09:48.422
You stay right here

09:46.002 --> 09:48.422
and watch that hole.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.673
You got it, dude.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.140
I'm good at this.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.728
- Nail.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.813
- Hammer.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.190
Tuna.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.400
Tuna.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.988
You know, Jess, I can handle

10:11.111 --> 10:13.988
a lot more responsibility.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.200
Even Pat lets Vanna spin

10:14.030 --> 10:17.200
the wheel once in a while.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.954
Hey, the attic's

10:18.910 --> 10:20.954
looking really good.

10:20.995 --> 10:24.207
And how about this

10:20.995 --> 10:24.207
sandwich I made, huh? Huh?

10:24.249 --> 10:25.708
Very nice.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.169
Hey, Uncle Jesse

10:28.211 --> 10:30.422
aren't you worried

10:28.211 --> 10:30.422
that you might miss

10:30.464 --> 10:32.424
and put a hole

10:30.464 --> 10:32.424
in the wall?

10:32.466 --> 10:34.092
I don't miss.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.511
Well, what if

10:34.134 --> 10:36.511
Joey missed?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.638
Why would I give

10:36.553 --> 10:38.638
Joey a hammer?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.975
Well, what if Joey

10:39.806 --> 10:41.975
took your hammer

10:42.016 --> 10:43.435
without your permission?

10:43.477 --> 10:44.852
Then there'd be

10:43.477 --> 10:44.852
a hole in the wall.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.313
And how would you fix it?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.482
Well, girls, basically,

10:46.354 --> 10:48.482
what I would do--

10:48.523 --> 10:51.859
Excuse me. Let the man

10:48.523 --> 10:51.859
with the tool belt explain.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.737
Now, to fix a hole in

10:51.901 --> 10:54.737
the wall is quite simple.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.531
You take a piece

10:54.779 --> 10:56.531
of drywall..

10:59.951 --> 11:03.455
...you take spackle,

10:59.951 --> 11:03.455
put that on, smooth it

11:03.497 --> 11:05.415
sand it, paint it

11:05.457 --> 11:07.917
and kiss

11:05.457 --> 11:07.917
the hole goodbye.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.674
Uncle Jesse, how come that

11:12.088 --> 11:15.674
window frame is crooked?

11:15.716 --> 11:17.594
That's impossible.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.220
- Joseph, level.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.220
- Yes, sir!

11:19.262 --> 11:21.722
Getting the level, sir!

11:19.262 --> 11:21.722
Bringing the level, sir!

11:21.764 --> 11:23.141
Handing the level, sir!

11:23.183 --> 11:25.393
- Suck in that gut.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.393
- Sucking in, sir!

11:27.437 --> 11:28.771
(Jesse)

11:27.437 --> 11:28.771
'That's level.'

11:29.606 --> 11:30.607
That's lev..

11:30.649 --> 11:31.690
Girls, you're crazy.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.900
This is perfectly lev..

11:32.942 --> 11:33.985
Where'd they go?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.362
Uh, you know

11:34.027 --> 11:35.362
these kids today.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.904
They just don't

11:35.403 --> 11:36.904
appreciate leveling

11:36.946 --> 11:38.739
like we used to.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.659
Yeah. Sad but true.

11:40.699 --> 11:43.244
Okay. I'm gonna fix

11:40.699 --> 11:43.244
my wall bed over there.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.954
Joseph, electrical tape.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.790
Oh, yes, master.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.377
Yes, I'll do your

11:47.832 --> 11:50.377
bidding, master.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.588
Get you the electrical

11:50.418 --> 11:53.588
tape, master.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.090
But, please,

11:53.630 --> 11:56.090
don't level my hump.

11:57.716 --> 12:00.178
You see, this is

11:57.716 --> 12:00.178
the exact immature attitude

12:00.220 --> 12:02.180
that makes me the king

12:00.220 --> 12:02.180
of home improvement

12:02.222 --> 12:04.140
and you but the court jester.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.892
Okay, fine. Do it all yourself.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.061
Well, at least

12:05.933 --> 12:08.061
it'll be done right.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.567
Whoa. Whoa!

12:13.608 --> 12:16.236
Whoa! Joey!

12:16.277 --> 12:18.821
'Joey! Help me!'

12:18.863 --> 12:23.535
Hark. Is that the king asking

12:18.863 --> 12:23.535
the court jester for help?

12:23.577 --> 12:25.078
Sound the trumpets.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.997
[imitating a trumpet]

12:28.039 --> 12:30.458
'Joseph, just get

12:28.039 --> 12:30.458
me out of here!'

12:31.918 --> 12:34.546
- Is there a switch?

12:31.918 --> 12:34.546
- 'Yeah, it's in my tool belt.'

12:34.588 --> 12:36.130
'I haven't put it in yet.'

12:36.172 --> 12:38.299
Good planning, Your Majesty.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.219
'I'm in here!'

12:46.933 --> 12:49.352
If I see you laugh once..

12:49.394 --> 12:50.937
You won't.

12:50.978 --> 12:54.065
[laughing]

12:57.902 --> 13:00.405
There. I'm okay now.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.616
I must have

13:00.447 --> 13:02.616
short-circuited the wire.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.576
Alright, cut me out of here.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.536
Isn't there something

13:04.618 --> 13:06.536
you'd like to say to me first

13:06.578 --> 13:09.997
something with the words...

13:06.578 --> 13:09.997
"I'm sorry" in it?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.917
Absolutely not.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.917
Okay, okay, okay.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.922
- I'm sorry.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.922
- For what?

13:17.964 --> 13:21.008
Well, maybe I was

13:17.964 --> 13:21.008
a tad on the bossy side..

13:21.050 --> 13:22.885
Okay, okay, okay.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.221
I was a power-crazed maniac.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.598
And?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.516
And, and I should learn

13:28.558 --> 13:29.768
to let people help me

13:29.808 --> 13:31.894
and not do everything

13:29.808 --> 13:31.894
myself, okay?

13:31.936 --> 13:35.064
Okay. I'll help

13:31.936 --> 13:35.064
you get out of there.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.815
There's just one thing

13:35.106 --> 13:36.815
I want to ask you first.

13:36.857 --> 13:40.111
- What?

13:36.857 --> 13:40.111
- Are you really stuck in there?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.237
Yes.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.989
Are you sure that you're really

13:43.030 --> 13:44.198
really stuck in there?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.366
Yes.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.451
Good, 'cause there's something

13:46.493 --> 13:47.661
I've always wanted to do to you.

13:47.702 --> 13:48.703
What? Hey, not the hair!

13:48.745 --> 13:50.330
Not the hair!

13:50.371 --> 13:51.956
Leave my hair alone!

13:51.998 --> 13:53.916
Now! Uh! Joseph!

13:53.958 --> 13:56.169
Joseph! Joseph! Joseph!

13:56.210 --> 13:58.463
Joseph! Joseph! Stop!

13:58.505 --> 14:01.508
[instrumental music]

14:02.634 --> 14:05.970
(D.J.)

14:02.634 --> 14:05.970
That ought to do it.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.388
Looks good to me.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.723
You would never

14:07.430 --> 14:08.723
know a pole

14:08.765 --> 14:10.433
went through

14:08.765 --> 14:10.433
that wall.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.268
Are you nuts?

14:13.394 --> 14:16.022
Michelle, don't

14:13.394 --> 14:16.022
stare right at it.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.732
If you glance

14:16.063 --> 14:17.732
at it real fast

14:17.774 --> 14:19.317
you don't

14:17.774 --> 14:19.317
even notice it.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.568
Watch.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.613
Now you try.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.326
I still see it.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.911
Who are we kidding?

14:30.953 --> 14:32.997
Dad is gonna freak.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.207
This never would have happened

14:34.248 --> 14:35.500
if you weren't

14:34.248 --> 14:35.500
following me around

14:35.542 --> 14:37.502
trying to act like a teenager.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.962
That doesn't matter now!

14:37.544 --> 14:39.962
Nothing matters!

14:40.004 --> 14:42.882
We're gonna be grounded

14:40.004 --> 14:42.882
in our room forever!

14:42.923 --> 14:44.801
Steph, don't panic.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.010
I have an idea.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.137
That'll never work!

14:48.179 --> 14:50.181
You haven't even

14:48.179 --> 14:50.181
heard my idea yet.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.392
Let's move the dresser

14:50.223 --> 14:52.392
to cover the hole.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.186
Like I said, that'll never work!

14:55.228 --> 14:57.438
Dad notices everything.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.106
He sees us when we're sleeping

14:59.148 --> 15:01.442
he knows when we're

14:59.148 --> 15:01.442
awake. He knows--

15:01.484 --> 15:03.778
Steph, that's Santa Claus.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.781
Now listen to me,

15:04.945 --> 15:06.781
all we have to do

15:06.823 --> 15:10.368
is move everything else along

15:06.823 --> 15:10.368
this wall over to the right.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.704
And he'll never notice

15:10.410 --> 15:12.704
we moved the dresser.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.288
Now come on.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.288
Help me push.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.584
(Danny)

15:15.331 --> 15:17.584
'Girls, I'm home.'

15:17.625 --> 15:19.419
He's home!

15:17.625 --> 15:19.419
We're dead!

15:19.460 --> 15:21.671
We're dead!

15:21.713 --> 15:24.799
We are not dead yet.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.799
We can still pull this off.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.551
Now, Michelle,

15:24.841 --> 15:26.551
I'm going to give you

15:26.593 --> 15:28.803
the most important

15:26.593 --> 15:28.803
job you've ever had.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.639
Do I get to watch

15:28.845 --> 15:31.639
the hole again?

15:32.766 --> 15:34.434
No, you have

15:32.766 --> 15:34.434
to go downstairs

15:34.475 --> 15:36.352
and stop dad

15:34.475 --> 15:36.352
from coming up here.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.479
How do I do that?

15:38.521 --> 15:41.023
Uh, talk to him.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.023
Keep him busy.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.776
Do whatever it takes.

15:42.817 --> 15:43.902
Now, can you do it?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.904
I can do it!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.196
Great. Go get him.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.868
Do you think

15:49.824 --> 15:51.868
she can do it?

17:25.294 --> 17:28.088
tell me her phone number
