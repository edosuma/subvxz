WEBVTT

00:07.141 --> 00:10.144
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.178 --> 00:13.981
I WILL NEVER TAKE ANOTHER DRIVING
LESSON FROM YOU AS LONG AS I LIVE!

00:14.014 --> 00:16.617
PERFECT, BECAUSE I WILL NEVER GIVE YOU
ANOTHER LESSON AS LONG AS I LIVE,

00:16.650 --> 00:19.687
WHICH WILL BE A LOT LONGER NOW THAT I'M NEVER
GETTING INTO A CAR THAT YOU'RE DRIVING.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.756
YOU ARE THE WORST TEACHER EVER.

00:22.790 --> 00:26.494
EVEN WORSE THAN MISS LAYMAN IN SECOND GRADE,
AND SHE LET THE WHOLE CLASS EAT PAINT.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.697
WELL, I HAVE NEVER SEEN A
BIGGER MENACE BEHIND THE WHEEL,

00:29.730 --> 00:32.166
AND THAT INCLUDES AFTER PROM
WHEN KEVIN MARTIN DROVE ME HOME

00:32.200 --> 00:34.168
WITH A KEG IN HIS LAP!

00:34.202 --> 00:36.637
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS TO RECOVER.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.106
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA
RECOVER, TOO,

00:38.139 --> 00:40.741
WITH A BOTTLE OF THIS.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.444
NUH-UH, I'M GOING
COMMANDO TONIGHT.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.582
LOOKS LIKE TODAY'S LESSON
WENT A LITTLE BETTER.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.784
YEAH, IT WAS THE BEST ONE YET.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.120
( theme music playing )

00:52.153 --> 00:54.422
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

00:54.455 --> 00:56.290
♪ WITH ME ♪

01:01.529 --> 01:04.332
- COME ON.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

01:04.365 --> 01:07.335
YOU LURED ME IN HERE WITH
THE PROMISE OF MOUSSAKA.

01:07.368 --> 01:10.338
I GOT MOUSSAKA... YUMMY MOUSSAKA...
RIGHT HERE, ALL RIGHT?

01:10.371 --> 01:12.773
BUT NO ONE'S GETTING ANY OF
THIS TILL WE CLEAR THE AIR.

01:12.806 --> 01:16.510
- I'M NOT TALKING TO HER.
- WELL, I'M NOT TALKING TO HER MORE.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.045
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, IF YOU TWO
GUYS DON'T START TALKING,

01:18.078 --> 01:20.114
YOU'RE GONNA KISS THE
MOUSSAKA GOODBYE.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.049
- WAIT, STOP!
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.785
- WE'LL TALK.
- JUST DON'T HURT THE MOUSSAKA.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.588
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED DURING
THAT DRIVING LESSON, HUH?

01:27.621 --> 01:29.089
HOW'D IT GET SO BAD?

01:29.123 --> 01:32.526
WELL, I GENEROUSLY TOOK THE AFTERNOON
OFF TO TEACH THIS ONE HERE,

01:32.560 --> 01:35.095
AND LET'S JUST SAY I
WAS COMPLETELY CALM

01:35.129 --> 01:36.764
WHEN I SET FOOT IN THAT CAR.

01:36.797 --> 01:40.468
- ALL RIGHT, HONEY, NOW YOU SEE THAT TRUCK?
- YES.

01:40.501 --> 01:44.238
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE GONNA PASS IT ON
THE LEFT, SO WATCH YOUR SPEED.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.440
WATCH MY SPEED? YOU TOLD ME
TO KEEP MY EYES ON THE ROAD.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.376
SPEED OR ROAD, WHICH IS IT?

01:48.409 --> 01:51.479
- YOU CAN DO BOTH.
- IT'S TOO MUCH. YOU DRIVE.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.714
OH! OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:53.747 --> 01:56.150
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.287
THAT IS COMPLETE
AND UTTER FICTION.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.190
SHE WAS IMPOSSIBLE FROM THE
MOMENT WE STEPPED IN THE CAR.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.125
YOU'RE GONNA KILL US!
NO! ( screams )

02:05.159 --> 02:08.196
THERE ARE NO OTHER CARS AROUND.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.830
I DON'T WANNA DIE

02:09.863 --> 02:12.533
IN THIS OUTFIT.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.702
- ( car honks )
- ( yelps )

02:14.735 --> 02:16.370
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE...

02:16.404 --> 02:18.872
TWO WOMEN GOT IN THE CAR.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.809
LOOK, YOU TWO JUST NEED TO
SHARE IN THE RESPONSIBILITY,

02:21.842 --> 02:24.245
APOLOGIZE TO EACH
OTHER AND MOVE ON.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.713
I'M NOT APOLOGIZING.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.449
AND I DID NOTHING WRONG, BUT TO
SHOW THAT I'M THE BIGGER PERSON,

02:28.482 --> 02:31.185
HOW ABOUT THIS? I WILL TAKE YOU
FOR ANOTHER LESSON TOMORROW

02:31.219 --> 02:34.888
AND WILL FASHION MYSELF A
DRESS MADE OUT OF AIRBAGS.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.758
WAIT A MINUTE. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WOULD
NEVER EVER TEACH LENNOX TO DRIVE AGAIN.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.627
YEAH, WELL, I ALSO SAID I'D
NEVER DRINK DURING THE DAYTIME.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.796
SOME THINGS ARE SAID IN ANGER.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.699
I SAY...

02:45.733 --> 02:47.601
NO, I'LL TAKE THE BUS...

02:47.635 --> 02:50.204
FOREVER.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.773
SHE'LL BE BACK. TRUST ME.
LENNOX IS NOT A BUS GIRL.

02:52.806 --> 02:56.510
ONE SLOW, STINKY RIDE PAST THE
FISH MARKET, SHE'LL COME AROUND.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.447
OR MAYBE LENNOX JUST
NEEDS A FRESH START.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.415
MAYBE SHE NEEDS A NEW TEACHER,
SOMEBODY A LITTLE CALMER.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.183
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY NOT...

03:03.217 --> 03:05.619
WELL, JUST NOT YOU.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.589
- YOU?
- YOU GOT ME, BABY, USE ME.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.158
DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.
IT MAKES ME TUMMY QUEASY.

03:11.191 --> 03:15.162
I AM A WAY BETTER DRIVER THAN YOU, OKAY?
I MEAN, I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.598
- YOU LOVE TO BRAG.
- NO. NO NO NO.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.334
IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M BRAGGING, BUT REALLY,
I'M JUST TELLING YOU HOW GREAT I AM.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.869
THESE ARE ALL JUST FACTS.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.905
I AM A HIGHLY-SKILLED
DRIVER, ALL RIGHT?

03:24.938 --> 03:27.775
I EVEN TOOK ONE OF THOSE
EVASIVE-ACTION DRIVING COURSES.

03:27.808 --> 03:31.445
WHY, SO YOU CAN PARALLEL PARK
WHILE THE K.G.B. SHOOTS AT YOU?

03:31.479 --> 03:33.281
YOU DON'T PARK WHILE
THEY'RE SHOOTING AT YOU.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.349
YOU TAKE CORNERS ON TWO WHEELS.

03:35.383 --> 03:38.486
LOOK, I HAVE A GIFT FOR TEACHING.
WE ALL HAVE OUR STRENGTHS.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.788
ALL RIGHT? YOURS IS...

03:40.821 --> 03:43.223
SLEEPING IN.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.659
- THAT'S TRUE. I AM GREAT AT THAT.
- MMM.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.728
BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT
WHO'S THE BETTER TEACHER.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.898
THAT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT. LET'S QUIT THE BACK
AND FORTH AND JUST GIVE ME THE CAR KEYS.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.500
NO, THIS IS MY PARENTING MOMENT.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.967
I WANT THE JOY OF
TEACHING LENNOX TO DRIVE.

03:54.001 --> 03:57.338
- JOY? YOU GUYS ARE BOTH MISERABLE.
- SURE, NOW.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.673
YOU KNOW, LIFE'S MILESTONES ARE
ALWAYS MISERY TO GO THROUGH,

03:59.707 --> 04:01.675
BUT ONCE YOU GET PAST THEM,
YOU REMEMBER THEM FONDLY.

04:01.709 --> 04:05.212
AND FOR MOMENTS LIKE THAT, YOU DON'T
ASK FOR HELP FROM THE HOUSEHOLD STAFF.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.816
( stammers ) I'M SORRY. "STAFF"?

04:08.849 --> 04:12.252
DID YOU JUST CALL
ME THE "S" WORD?

04:12.286 --> 04:14.788
YEAH, I HAVE A LOT OF
"S" WORDS FOR YOU.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.290
AND ANYWAY, TRUST ME,

04:16.324 --> 04:18.826
I DO NOT NEED YOUR HELP
TEACHING MY NIECE HOW TO DRIVE.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.461
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
I'LL STAY OUT OF IT.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.396
WHAT OTHER "S" WORDS
DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

04:22.430 --> 04:25.699
- HOW MUCH TIME YOU GOT?
- IS ONE OF THEM "SEXY"?

04:27.701 --> 04:29.870
YES YES, THAT IS THE
ONE I USE THE MOST...

04:30.938 --> 04:33.441
THAT AND "SDELUDED."

04:36.877 --> 04:39.980
HEY, MEL. WOW, YOU'RE ALL DRESSED UP.
WHERE YOU HEADING?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.784
STEPHANIE'S PICKING ME UP.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.619
WE'RE GOING ESTATE
SALE SHOPPING.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.856
YOU GOTTA LOOK BROKE WHEN YOU'RE
LOWBALLING FOR GRANDMA'S SILVER.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.358
JEEZ, BURKE, WHAT'S NEXT?
YOU GONNA GO GRAVESIDE

04:50.391 --> 04:52.926
AND YANK OUT SOME GOLD TEETH?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.495
WILL YOU MOVE YOUR CAR?
YOU'RE BLOCKING ME IN.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.330
HERE, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST TAKE IT?

04:56.364 --> 04:59.467
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT
IT, FILL 'ER UP.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.968
( British accent )
RIGHT AWAY, MA'AM.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.836
YES, AFTER ALL, I AM THE STAFF.

05:04.672 --> 05:08.075
- ( normal voice ) YOU LIKE ME BRITISH?
- I BARELY LIKE YOU AMERICAN.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.682
HEY, BUD, I KNOW IT DOESN'T
MATTER TO YOU, MAN,

05:14.715 --> 05:16.083
BUT I GOT YOUR CLEAN CLOTHES...

05:17.918 --> 05:20.754
- ( camera clicks )
- ...HERE.

05:20.788 --> 05:24.558
HEY, JOE, I BET YOU'RE WONDERING
WHAT ALL THIS IS HERE.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.760
NO NO, NOT AT ALL. I
DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE

05:26.794 --> 05:28.562
ALL THOSE PRETTY LADIES SHOES
THAT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.998
SEE, IT'S JUST...

05:31.031 --> 05:32.800
JUST KIND OF A PROJECT OF MINE.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.436
YEAH, TAKING PICTURES
OF YOUR AUNT'S SHOES?

05:35.469 --> 05:36.937
DID SHE ASK YOU TO DO THAT?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.940
YEAH. I MEAN, NO.
NO, I VOLUNTEERED.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.943
I'M JUST TAKING PICTURES AND PUTTING
THEM ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOXES

05:42.976 --> 05:44.745
SO SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE HAS.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.914
SO YOU LIKE PLAYING
WITH LADIES' SHOES?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.984
ORGANIZING THEM, POSING THEM.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.321
WEARING THEM?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.089
NO. NO NO NO NO.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.358
THEY'RE MUCH TOO SMALL. I
COULD NEVER FIT MY SIZE 11s

05:58.392 --> 06:00.661
INTO THESE DELICATE
PEEP TOE PUMPS.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.931
I'M GUESSING.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.099
OKAY, KID, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:06.133 --> 06:08.035
I'M JUST GONNA PUT
YOUR LAUNDRY DOWN HERE

06:08.068 --> 06:12.039
AND I'M GONNA JUST ACCEPT
YOU THE WAY THAT YOU ARE.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.107
THANKS, JOE. CLOSE
THE DOOR BEHIND YOU?

06:14.141 --> 06:16.109
OH GOD, YEAH. GOOD AND TIGHT.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.048
I'LL TELL YOU... A FEW
MORE LESSONS FROM ME

06:21.081 --> 06:23.083
AND YOU'RE GONNA ACE
YOUR DRIVER'S TEST.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.852
AND THEN WHEN YOUR AUNT
ASKS, "HOW DID SHE DO IT?"

06:24.885 --> 06:28.656
I'M GONNA SAY, "WELL, ACTUALLY,
I DID IT." AND EVERYBODY WINS.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.591
HOW DOES AUNT MEL WIN?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.660
TECHNICALLY, SHE DOESN'T.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.128
HEY, YOU JUST PASSED THE HOUSE.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.098
CAN'T WE DRIVE AROUND THE
BLOCK JUST ONE MORE TIME?

06:38.131 --> 06:41.034
NO, HM-MMM. NO, WE HAVE TO GET
HOME BEFORE YOUR AUNT DOES.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.070
- WHY?
- ( brakes squeak )

06:44.438 --> 06:48.008
WHY? BECAUSE THESE
ARE SECRET LESSONS.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.043
SECRET IN WHAT WAY?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.880
SECRET FROM YOUR AUNT,

06:52.913 --> 06:56.584
'CAUSE SHE KIND OF DEMANDED THAT I
NEVER EVER TEACH YOU HOW TO DRIVE.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.418
KIND OF DEMANDED?

06:58.452 --> 07:00.153
YOU KNOW HOW COMPETITIVE SHE IS.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.056
IT WOULD KILL HER TO KNOW THAT I'M DOING
A MUCH BETTER JOB THAN SHE WOULD.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.927
SO WE'RE KEEPING IT A
SECRET, BUT IT'S FOR HER.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.630
IT'S GONNA GIVE YOU GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO PRACTICE DRIVING IN REVERSE ANYWAY.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.901
SO IF SHE FINDS OUT THAT YOU'RE
TEACHING ME HOW TO DRIVE,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.003
- WE'RE BOTH IN TROUBLE?
- NO, WE'RE NOT GONNA GET IN TROUBLE,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.771
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
GONNA FIND OUT.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.973
JUST RELAX. NOW LOOK,
CHECK BOTH MIRRORS.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.010
CHECK YOUR BLIND
SPOTS, ALL RIGHT?

07:23.043 --> 07:26.079
- ( engine revving )
- WATCH OUT FOR OTHER PEDESTRIANS, OTHER CARS...

07:26.113 --> 07:28.849
( crashes )

07:28.882 --> 07:30.884
...AND MAILBOXES.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.995
OH MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE I KILLED MRS.
ROSER'S MAILBOX.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.732
AUNT MEL IS GONNA HAVE MY
HEAD ON A SILVER PLATTER.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.067
RELAX, ALL RIGHT? SHE
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW

07:47.100 --> 07:49.570
WHERE WE KEEP THE PLATTERS.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.540
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL HER?
- WE'RE GONNA TELL HER THE TRUTH, ALL RIGHT?

07:52.573 --> 07:55.008
WE'RE GONNA TELL HER THAT I
TOOK THE CAR OUT BY MYSELF,

07:55.042 --> 07:58.445
AND I WASN'T LOOKING WHERE I WAS
GOING, AND I RAN OVER A MAILBOX.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.781
THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH!

08:01.849 --> 08:03.984
IN 100 YEARS, WILL
IT REALLY MATTER?

08:04.017 --> 08:06.587
BUT IF I TELL HER YOU DID
IT, SHE'LL KNOW I'M LYING.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.656
- HOW?
- 'CAUSE SHE KNOWS ME.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.924
SHE CAN LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND
DETECT LYING. IT'S FREAKY.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.994
AND LET ME TELL YOU, IT HAS
REALLY HURT ME SOCIALLY.

08:14.027 --> 08:17.130
ALL RIGHT, FINE, I'LL DO THE TALKING.
JUST BACK ME UP.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.132
SILENTLY, RIGHT?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.602
WITH NO EYE CONTACT?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.871
YES, SILENTLY, OKAY?

08:23.904 --> 08:27.107
JUST TRY TO LOOK INNOCENT, AND I'LL TRY
TO LOOK LIKE I MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.611
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PRACTICE WITH
THAT, BUT I'LL GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.513
- Melissa: HEY, GUYS.
- OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD!

08:33.547 --> 08:36.249
- WHAT?
- I LOOK GUILTY ALREADY AND I REEK OF DECEPTION!

08:36.283 --> 08:38.686
LENNOX, YOU DON'T LOOK...
WHERE ARE YOU...

08:41.722 --> 08:45.058
TADA! LOOK WHAT SOMEONE
COULDN'T TAKE TO HEAVEN.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.997
CERTAINLY GONNA MAKE THIS
PLACE LOOK LIKE HELL.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.100
IT'S SO UGLY, IT'S GOTTA
BE WORTH SOMETHING.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.968
YEAH, CARE FOR A GLASS OF WINE?

08:55.002 --> 08:57.070
I CARE DEEPLY. WHOA,
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.840
THIS IS THE $18 BOTTLE.
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.609
( chuckles ) YEAH,
YOU START SIPPING

09:01.642 --> 09:04.177
AND I'LL START TALKING, OKAY?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.081
IT'S GOOD, ISN'T IT? TAKE... TAKE
JUST A LITTLE MORE OF THAT, YEAH.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.019
OKAY, SO LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.188
I TOOK YOUR CAR TO THE HARDWARE
STORE AND HAD A LITTLE ACCIDENT.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.191
AND I RAN OVER MRS.
ROSER'S MAILBOX.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.928
OH MY GOD. HOW'S MY CAR?

09:20.961 --> 09:23.296
I'M FINE. THANK YOU.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.599
LOOK, THE CAR'S FINE. IT'S GOT A
LITTLE DENT IN THE REAR FENDER, OKAY?

09:25.633 --> 09:28.736
IT'S HARDLY NOTICEABLE AND THE
CAR'S COMPLETELY DRIVABLE.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.104
SO THAT EVASIVE DRIVING COURSE
YOU TOOK DIDN'T PREPARE YOU

09:31.138 --> 09:33.774
FOR THE DANGER OF A
STATIONARY MAILBOX?

09:33.807 --> 09:35.175
YEAH, I GUESS NOT.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.044
I'M GONNA FIX THE DENT, THOUGH,

09:37.077 --> 09:38.679
AND BUY A NEW MAILBOX.
SO ARE WE GOOD?

09:38.712 --> 09:42.683
NOT YET. I STILL NEED YOU
TO DO ONE TINY THING

09:42.716 --> 09:45.152
- TO HELP ME GET OVER THIS. ( sighs )
- NAME IT.

09:45.185 --> 09:48.155
SAY I'M A BETTER
DRIVER THAN YOU.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.657
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. IT COULD
HAVE HAPPENED TO ANYBODY.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.659
YEAH, BUT IT DIDN'T.

09:51.692 --> 09:55.595
IT HAPPENED TO YOU BECAUSE...

09:55.629 --> 09:58.265
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.101
AND THAT MAKES MEL...

10:01.134 --> 10:03.804
- A BETTER DRIVER...
- THAN...

10:03.837 --> 10:05.639
JOE.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.676
IT DOESN'T REALLY COUNT
UNLESS YOU SAY IT ALTOGETHER.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.014
- MEL'S A BETTER DRIVER THAN JOE.
- MMM.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.751
THIS CHARDONNAY PAIRS
WELL WITH HUMILIATION.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.221
HEY, SLOW DOWN, SPORT.
YOU'RE COMING TO A DOOR.

10:27.094 --> 10:30.831
RYDER, VERY NICE
WORK ON MY SHOES.

10:30.864 --> 10:34.167
NOW THAT THE JOB'S DONE, CAN
YOU SIGN THIS FORM FOR SCHOOL?

10:34.201 --> 10:37.771
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT, THIS SHOE
PROJECT TOOK YOU, WHAT, 10 HOURS?

10:37.805 --> 10:41.074
YEAH, YOUR SCHOOL REQUIRES A
FULL LEGITIMATE 20 HOURS.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.377
CAN'T FAKE THIS. IT'S
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.714
I PHOTOGRAPHED A
CLOSETFUL OF SHOES.

10:46.747 --> 10:50.050
MY HANDS SMELL LIKE FEET.
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

10:50.083 --> 10:53.153
10 MORE HOURS. YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL MY GARMENTS.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.322
YOU KNOW, CHECK EVERYTHING FOR
HOLES, TEARS, RIPS, SNAGS AND RUNS.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.158
OH, AND PAY SPECIAL
ATTENTION TO THE PANTYHOSE.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.160
PANTYHOSE?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.029
JOE ALREADY SAW ME
PHOTOGRAPHING YOUR SHOES.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.097
HE THINKS THAT, UM...

11:04.131 --> 11:06.366
GOD KNOWS WHAT HE THINKS.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.201
THEN KEEP THIS ON THE DOWN LOW.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.670
YOU KNOW, THE LESS JOE KNOWS ABOUT
OUR LITTLE ARRANGEMENT, THE BETTER.

11:10.704 --> 11:14.141
HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
IS TRUE COMMUNITY SERVICE.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.376
I'M A LITTLE FUZZY ON THAT, TOO.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.847
ANY TIME I'M NOT
WASTING IN MY CLOSET,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.648
I CAN BE SERVING THE
PEOPLE OF TOLEDO.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.751
YOU KNOW, EVERY SNAG
AND TEAR THAT YOU FIND

11:23.784 --> 11:25.753
IS ANOTHER CONSTITUENT
EMAIL ANSWERED

11:25.786 --> 11:27.821
OR A CURB REPAINTED.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.124
SO BY DIGGING THROUGH YOUR UNDERWEAR
DRAWER, I'M SERVING THE GREATER GOOD?

11:31.158 --> 11:33.961
FINALLY, SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.264
LENNOX, IT'S FINE.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.267
NO, THAT'S IT, JOE. NO MORE
SECRET DRIVING LESSONS.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.935
IT'S TOO RISKY.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.136
YOU DID GREAT, THOUGH. YOU
WERE LIKE A PRO OUT THERE.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.038
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T
HIT A SINGLE THING.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.374
YEAH, BUT AUNT MEL SAW US.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.309
- NO, SHE DIDN'T.
- YES, SHE DID.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.411
- I SWEAR THAT WAS HER CAR THAT WE PASSED.
- THAT WAS NOT HER CAR.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.847
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CARS OUT
THERE THAT LOOK JUST LIKE THAT,

11:53.881 --> 11:57.851
THAT ARE BEING POORLY DRIVEN
BY BLONDE-HAIRED WOMEN.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.788
- I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA LEARN HOW TO DRIVE, HUH?

12:00.821 --> 12:03.290
MAYBE I WON'T. I JUST KNOW
SHE'S GONNA FIND OUT.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.026
SHE IS NOT GONNA FIND OUT. YOU ARE GIVING
YOUR AUNT WAY TOO MUCH CREDIT, ALL RIGHT?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.962
IF SHE KNEW HALF THE STUFF THAT
I GOT AWAY WITH... I MEAN,

12:08.996 --> 12:11.064
"YEAH, MEL, MM-HMM, I CAUGHT
THAT RAT UP IN THE ATTIC

12:11.098 --> 12:13.700
AND I LET IT GO FREE IN THE WILD,
AND I KNOW TONIGHT IT'S AT HOME

12:13.733 --> 12:16.436
HAVING A NICE DINNER WITH HIS
WIFE AND KIDS." RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

12:16.469 --> 12:19.706
IN A COUPLE WEEKS, IT'S ALL GONNA BE
OVER AND YOU'RE GONNA PASS THAT TEST.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.174
OH, WHAT TEST?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.476
- UM...
- THE MATH TEST.

12:23.510 --> 12:27.147
SHE'S GOT A MATH TEST WITH
NUMBERS AND SHAPES AND WHATNOT.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.216
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
HAD A TEST COMING UP.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.418
I DO. I DO. I SWEAR I DO.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.187
YEP, JUST DON'T LOOK AT ME!
I HAVE TO GO STUDY!

12:34.221 --> 12:36.256
STOP ASKING ME
QUESTIONS ABOUT MATH!

12:37.858 --> 12:39.326
SHE'S 16 YEARS OLD.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.261
WILL YOU JUST LET HER HAVE
HER OWN MATH LIFE, PLEASE?

12:41.294 --> 12:43.964
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.765
WHAT? NO.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.936
I BET SHE'S STILL UPSET ABOUT THAT
DEBACLE OF A DRIVING LESSON WE HAD.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.104
- ( sighs )
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.940
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.242
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT, 100%.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.245
YOU. CANNOT GET
ANYTHING BY MEL BURKE.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.251
( doorbell rings )

13:04.284 --> 13:06.019
MRS. ROSER, I'M SO SORRY. I'VE
BEEN MEANING TO COME OVER

13:06.053 --> 13:08.221
AND OFFER MY CONDOLENCES
FOR YOUR MAILBOX.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.522
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

13:09.556 --> 13:12.960
WELL, BECAUSE I HAVE,
YOU KNOW, LIKE, A LIFE.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.029
I DON'T. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.931
NICE PLACE.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.400
I'VE ONLY EVER SEEN IT
THROUGH YOUR MAIL SLOT.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.369
THAT'S NOT CREEPY.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.237
ANYWAY, I'M REALLY SORRY

13:24.271 --> 13:26.106
AND I WANNA PAY FOR THE DAMAGES.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.241
YOUR HOUSEBOY BROUGHT
OVER A CHECK,

13:28.275 --> 13:29.943
BUT IT'S FOR THE WRONG AMOUNT.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.913
IT'S NOT $50. IT'S $150.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.415
FOR THAT PIECE OF... AMERICANA?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.784
LET ME JUST WRITE
YOU ANOTHER CHECK.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.220
AND YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE
BEFORE LETTING MR. MUSCLES

13:40.253 --> 13:42.022
GIVE YOUR NIECE ANOTHER
DRIVING LESSON.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.391
CLEARLY, HE HAS NO
IDEA WHAT HE'S DOING.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.359
LENNOX WAS DRIVING?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.395
WHEN SHE WASN'T CRASHING.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.064
AND JOE WAS TEACHING?

13:51.098 --> 13:53.266
IF YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.869
DON'T YOU HAVE A CLUE WHAT
GOES ON IN YOUR HOUSE?

13:55.903 --> 13:58.238
APPARENTLY I DON'T.

14:08.248 --> 14:11.919
( knocks ) RYDER, LOOK WHAT
YOUR AUNT GOT YOU, BUDDY.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.922
IT'S NOT WHAT IT
LOOKS LIKE, REALLY.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.225
YOU KNOW WHAT, DUDE?
YOU REALLY...

14:19.259 --> 14:21.294
YOU REALLY GOT START
LOCKING THIS DOOR.

14:23.096 --> 14:27.034
HEY, SO I JUST FOUND
OUT THAT AFTER DINNER,

14:27.067 --> 14:28.235
YOUR AUNT HAS A CITY
COUNCIL MEETING,

14:28.268 --> 14:29.536
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU GET
BEHIND THE WHEEL AGAIN?

14:29.569 --> 14:31.304
WE DO A LITTLE FREEWAY?
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.306
HOW ARE YOU SO CALM ABOUT THIS?
I'M FREAKING OUT,

14:33.340 --> 14:36.009
BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE
YOU'RE ENJOYING THE LIE.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.877
I AM A LITTLE.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.081
NO, I'M SORRY. I AM A LOT.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.117
LOOK, JUST DO WHAT I DO
AND ACT NATURAL, OKAY?

14:44.151 --> 14:46.519
RIGHT.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.256
- Melissa: HEY, LENNOX.
- ( screams )

14:49.289 --> 14:52.459
SLIPPERY SILVERWARE. SORRY.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.194
THAT'S OKAY, HONEY. IT'S A
PERFECTLY NORMAL THING TO DO,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.863
YOU KNOW, TO GET ALL JUMPY
WHEN SOMEBODY JUST SAYS HI.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.632
( laughs, whispers ) WILL YOU
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, PLEASE?

14:59.666 --> 15:02.970
( whispers ) BUT SHE KNOWS.
SHE KNOWS!

15:03.003 --> 15:04.271
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.074
HEY, LISTEN, HONEY, I WAS
THINKING AFTER DINNER,

15:07.107 --> 15:09.242
MAYBE WE COULD TAKE
A DRIVING LESSON.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.211
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A
MEETING TONIGHT.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.213
NO NO, THE MEETING
WAS CANCELLED.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.249
YEAH, FUNNY, SOME PEOPLE
KNEW ABOUT IT FOR DAYS

15:16.283 --> 15:18.651
AND KEPT IT FROM ME. THEY KNEW THE
TRUTH AND THEY DIDN'T TELL ME.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.153
DON'T YOU HATE THAT?

15:20.187 --> 15:23.190
DON'T YOU FIND THAT HURTFUL?

15:23.223 --> 15:25.925
MAYBE THEY WANTED TO
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

15:25.959 --> 15:28.128
BUT THEY WERE FORBIDDEN.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.132
OR MAYBE THEY DID IT BECAUSE IT
WAS THE BEST THING FOR EVERYBODY.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.169
YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T
TAKE YOU OUT DRIVING.

15:36.203 --> 15:39.206
MY CAR'S NOT HERE.
IT'S GETTING REPAIRED.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.274
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME KNOW HOW
MUCH IT COSTS TO BANG OUT THAT DING?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.476
YEAH, IT'S NOT A DING. IT'S
MORE THAN A DING, JOE.

15:43.510 --> 15:47.414
- IT'S A DONG.
- WHAT?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.217
YEAH, MY MECHANIC SAID THAT
LITTLE ACCIDENT YOU HAD

15:50.250 --> 15:52.285
KNOCKED THE REAR AXLE
COMPLETELY OUT OF ALIGNMENT.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.354
SAYS IT'S GONNA COST
$3,000 TO REPAIR IT.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.456
- $3,000?
- YEAH.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.559
THREE AND THEN THOUSAND.

16:01.494 --> 16:05.498
BUT THAT'S WHAT JOE MAKES
IN, LIKE, 10 YEARS.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.368
THANK YOU, LENNOX.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.570
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS MY PROBLEM.

16:10.603 --> 16:13.040
SO LET ME HANDLE THIS, OKAY? WHY
DON'T YOU GO IN THE OTHER ROOM HERE

16:13.073 --> 16:15.175
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS BY MYSELF.
THANK YOU.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.610
- JOE, IT'S NOT FAIR.
- I KNOW. LIFE'S NOT FAIR, SWEETIE. THANK YOU.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.348
ALL RIGHT, SO LOOK,

16:21.381 --> 16:24.551
YOU KNOW, I'LL PAY FOR
THE WHOLE $3,000.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.220
NO, JOE, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU COULD HAVE LIED.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.356
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE
CAR GOT HIT BY SOMEONE ELSE

16:29.389 --> 16:31.158
IN A PARKING LOT,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.026
YOU WERE HONEST WITH ME,

16:33.060 --> 16:36.263
AND I WANNA PAY FOR
IT, OKAY, GOOD JOE.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.999
HONEST JOE.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.435
NO, I DON'T REALLY
FEEL RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.604
NO, I'LL PAY YOU BACK, OKAY?

16:44.637 --> 16:47.207
HUNDRED BUCKS A
WEEK FOR 30 WEEKS.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.708
DOESN'T SEEM VERY FAIR.

16:48.741 --> 16:52.312
I MEAN, WON'T YOU OWE
ME INTEREST, TOO?

16:53.713 --> 16:56.283
100 BUCKS A WEEK FOR 40 WEEKS.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.418
AND I'LL NEED A RENTAL CAR
WHILE IT'S GETTING REPAIRED

16:58.451 --> 17:01.254
- AND I LIKE A SUNROOF.
- 50 WEEKS, OKAY?

17:01.288 --> 17:05.058
IT WAS ME! I WAS THE ONE DRIVING.
I KILLED THAT MAILBOX.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.659
JOE TOOK ME OUT FOR
SECRET LESSONS!

17:06.693 --> 17:09.396
OH MY GOD. ALL THIS STUDYING
IS MAKING HER INSANE.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.565
GO UPSTAIRS, WILL YOU, LENNOX?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.434
- THAT ONE IS...
- JOE.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.303
MRS. ROSER TOLD ME THE TRUTH.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.405
MRS. ROSER? YOU'RE GONNA BELIEVE MRS.
ROSER?

17:18.438 --> 17:20.607
THAT WOMAN WATCHES ME CLEAN
THROUGH THE MAIL SLOT.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.210
OKAY, NO CHANGING THE SUBJECT.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.611
I ASKED YOU TO DO ME
ONE LITTLE FAVOR.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.379
I ASKED YOU NOT TO
TEACH LENNOX TO DRIVE.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.781
HOW HARD IS IT TO
NOT DO SOMETHING?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.350
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
YOU TEACH HER,

17:30.383 --> 17:33.220
THE BETTER GUY TEACHES HER...
AS LONG AS SHE PASSES THE TEST.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.287
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT!

17:34.321 --> 17:36.223
WHAT THE HELL IS IT ABOUT THEN?

17:36.256 --> 17:39.726
IT'S... IT'S... YOU
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.364
THIS IS WHY YOU GOTTA LIE.

17:46.366 --> 17:50.069
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, BURKE?

17:50.103 --> 17:52.305
NOTHING.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.107
BURKE.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.477
BURKE.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.546
WE'RE NOT MARRIED. YOU CAN'T
GIVE ME THE SILENT TREATMENT.

18:04.417 --> 18:08.188
IS IT ABOUT THE RAT?
LOOK, I WAS VERY KIND.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.523
HE DIDN'T FEEL A THING.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.459
YOU KNOW WHO TAUGHT
ME HOW TO DRIVE, JOE?

18:12.492 --> 18:15.328
CHARLES, MY FATHER'S CHAUFFEUR.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.131
"WELL DONE, MISS BURKE.
VERY NICE JOB, MISS BURKE.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.433
THAT WAS A PEDESTRIAN,
MISS BURKE."

18:20.467 --> 18:22.335
AND WHEN WE WERE DONE,
CHARLES TIPPED HIS HAT

18:22.369 --> 18:24.337
AND ASKED ME TO
SIGN HIS TIMECARD.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.106
DAD MADE THE STAFF TEACH
YOU HOW TO DRIVE?

18:27.140 --> 18:29.309
THAT'S A LITTLE COLD.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.812
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE LENNOX THE MEMORY OF
LEARNING TO DRIVE FROM A LOVING RELATIVE,

18:32.845 --> 18:36.316
SOMETHING I WISH SOMEONE
HAD DONE FOR ME.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.418
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING?

18:38.451 --> 18:41.288
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT, I WOULDN'T HAVE SWEPT
IN THERE AND TAKEN AWAY YOUR MOMENT.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.324
- NOW I FEEL LIKE A TOTAL...
- WAD.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.425
- WELL, I MEAN...
- JERK.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.461
- DIPSTICK.
- HEY, BURKE.

18:48.495 --> 18:52.131
I APPRECIATE THE APOLOGY, BUT
LOOK, AS PARENTALISH UNITS,

18:52.165 --> 18:53.433
WE HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.202
WE CAN'T BE SNEAKING AROUND.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.503
WAIT A MINUTE. BACK UP, BACK UP.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.205
YOU JUST CALLED ME "A
PARENTALISH UNIT."

18:58.238 --> 19:00.507
WHEN DID I GET PROMOTED
FROM HOUSEHOLD STAFF?

19:00.540 --> 19:04.444
YOU'RE MORE THAN STAFF.
YOU'RE STAFF-PLUS.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.114
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE BASICALLY
MY CO-PARENT PERSON.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.449
CO-PARENT?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.419
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.522
NOT GONNA PUT THAT ON
MY RESUME OR ANYTHING.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.490
AND AS CO-PARENTS, YOU CAN'T BE
DOING THINGS BEHIND MY BACK.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.159
FROM NOW ON, YOU CAN ONLY
DO THINGS TO MY FRONT.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.537
I JUST GOT A LITTLE
SICK RIGHT THERE.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.472
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN...
NO MORE SECRETS.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.507
I GOT IT, OKAY?

19:34.541 --> 19:38.411
HEY, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, I
ACTUALLY MADE ANOTHER MOUSSAKA

19:38.445 --> 19:40.413
AND I HID IT IN THE
VEGETABLE CRISPER.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.482
WE HAVE A VEGETABLE CRISPER?

19:42.515 --> 19:45.318
YEAH, IT'S THE LITTLE DRAWER
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 'FRIDGE.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.288
OH, THE BACON HOLDER.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.458
ALL DONE, AUNT MEL. 20 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.493
I NEVER WANT MY ARM INSIDE
YOUR PANTYHOSE AGAIN.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.797
BECAUSE I'M MORE OF
A SHOE MAN MYSELF.

19:57.830 --> 20:01.534
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
- WE HAVE... WE JUST...

20:01.568 --> 20:03.236
WHAT IS IT WE HAVE, RYDER?

20:03.270 --> 20:06.806
NOT COMMUNITY SERVICE,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.475
GIVE ME THIS.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.443
"DEAR GRANT HIGH ADMINISTRATION,

20:10.477 --> 20:13.513
RYDER SCANLON HAS COMPLETED 20 HOURS
OF VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY SERVICE

20:13.546 --> 20:14.947
TO THE CITY OF TOLEDO.

20:14.981 --> 20:18.451
AUTHORIZED BY THE
HONORABLE MEL BURKE."

20:19.652 --> 20:21.588
SO CATALOGUING SHOES AND
ORGANIZING PANTYHOSE

20:21.621 --> 20:24.591
- IS COMMUNITY SERVICE?
- LET ME SEE THAT.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.594
( clears throat )
YEAH, IT SAYS IT IS.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.263
SEE, IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO
SPEND TIME IN HER CLOSET,

20:30.297 --> 20:32.632
THEN CURBS GET PAINTED
AND TOLEDO WINS.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.636
- SHE EXPLAINS IT BETTER.
- THANKS, RYDER.

20:36.669 --> 20:40.607
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS NOW
BECAUSE MY HOURS ARE DONE.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.843
NO MORE SECRETS, HUH?

20:43.876 --> 20:46.813
STARTING... NOW.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.288
HOW WAS YOUR DRIVING
LESSON WITH AUNT MEL?

20:55.322 --> 20:57.590
GOOD GOOD. HARDLY
ANYTHING HAPPENED.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.927
- BY THE WAY, IS JOE AROUND?
- NO, I THINK HE WENT TO THE GYM.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.663
DID HE NOW? WE'RE GOOD!

21:07.800 --> 21:09.536
YOU TELL ANYBODY WHAT
YOU SAW HERE TODAY,

21:09.569 --> 21:11.738
YOU'LL WIND UP LIKE THIS SIGN.

21:11.771 --> 21:15.608
- WOW, GOOD GOING, LENNOX.
- HEY, I WASN'T THE ONE DRIVING.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.710
I WOULDN'T HAVE HIT THE SIGN IF
YOU HADN'T BEEN SHOUTING AT ME.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.447
I WAS SHOUTING "LOOK OUT
FOR THE STOP SIGN!"

21:20.480 --> 21:21.914
CAN YOU HELP US CARRY
THIS TO THE GARAGE?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.883
WE'RE GONNA WRAP IT IN AN
ORIENTAL RUG AND BURY IT

21:23.916 --> 21:25.585
SO JOE WILL NEVER KNOW.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.688
JOE WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT?

21:28.721 --> 21:30.690
WILL NEVER KNOW HOW
MUCH I VALUE HIM

21:30.723 --> 21:32.759
AS A CO-PARENT.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.462
PLEASE ACCEPT THIS KEYCHAIN
AS A TOKEN OF MY ESTEEM.
