00:01.990 --> 00:04.990
>> Julie: It was a party in the
house all week.

00:04.990 --> 00:09.830
But for either James or Jeff,
the party is about to come to an

00:09.830 --> 00:09.990
end.

00:09.990 --> 00:13.990
Welcome to "Big Brother."

00:16.990 --> 00:20.990
Captioning funded by CBS
announcer: Previously on "big
brother."

00:20.990 --> 00:24.990
After Jeff told Austin he was on
to Liz's secret.

00:24.990 --> 00:27.990
>> Liz has an identical twin.

00:27.990 --> 00:31.990
I think one has a crush on you
and one doesn't.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.990
But the one that doesn't has
crush on me.

00:35.990 --> 00:38.990
>> If Jeff is going to keep
pressing this Liz and Julia

00:38.990 --> 00:41.990
thing it's making him a bigger
target in my mind.

00:41.990 --> 00:45.990
>> But head of household Vanessa
was intent on taking out James
instead.

00:45.990 --> 00:49.990
>> I want to get out with as
little blood on my hands as
possible.

00:49.990 --> 00:53.990
>> I still see Jeff as a bigger
target but she is hoh so I

00:53.990 --> 00:56.990
have to go along with it.

00:56.990 --> 01:00.990
>> Hoping to keep her
nominations the same, Vanessa

01:00.990 --> 01:02.410
wanted her alliance to control
the veto.

01:02.410 --> 01:13.990
>> Hopefully myself, Shelli or
Austin can do it so they can't
pull themselves off the block.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.990
>> Congratulations, John you
have won the golden power of
veto.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.540
>> Now.

01:18.540 --> 01:19.990
>> Vanessa need add plan b.

01:19.990 --> 01:21.540
>> How what do you want to do.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.990
>> We have to make a decision.

01:23.990 --> 01:25.990
Announcer: Using Jeff's words
against him --

01:25.990 --> 01:35.700
>> Vanessa and Austin came up
with a plan to make Jeff look

01:35.700 --> 01:35.990
bad.

01:35.990 --> 01:40.990
>> The whole house wants Audrey
out but I need an excuse to get

01:40.990 --> 01:42.990
somebody else up on the block.

01:42.990 --> 01:45.990
Jeff would be the perfect
replacement nominee.

01:45.990 --> 01:48.990
>> And they put him on full
blast.

01:48.990 --> 01:53.830
>> Have they said you can't work
with Jeff --

01:53.830 --> 01:54.990
>> what the hell?

01:54.990 --> 01:55.990
>> At the veto meeting.

01:55.990 --> 02:01.990
>> I have decided to use the
power of veto to save myself.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.700
>> Vanessa put her new target on
the block.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.990
>> Jeff, please take a seat.

02:06.990 --> 02:09.990
Announcer: Tonight either
James or Jeff will leave the

02:09.990 --> 02:12.990
"Big Brother" house and two new
houseguests will rise to power.

02:12.990 --> 02:16.990
Plus, a love triangle brings
Austin to his boiling point.

02:16.990 --> 02:18.950
>> What is going on.

02:18.950 --> 02:21.120
>> Why are you under the covers
together.

02:21.120 --> 02:26.990
>> All of this live on "big
brother."

03:06.830 --> 03:11.120
[Cheering]
>> Julie: Good evening.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.410
I'm Julie chen.

03:12.410 --> 03:13.990
Welcome to "Big Brother."

03:13.990 --> 03:17.990
Once again the houseguests had
Audrey marked for eviction and

03:17.990 --> 03:22.990
once again, she eluded the block
as head of household Vanessa had

03:22.990 --> 03:24.990
other plans.

03:24.990 --> 03:29.990
Now, two unsuspecting targets
find their game in jeopardy.

03:29.990 --> 03:34.990
So is James the country boy,
headed out to pasture or will

03:34.990 --> 03:37.990
Jess hunt for a half million
dollars come to an end?

03:37.990 --> 03:40.990
We will find out soon enough.

03:40.990 --> 03:44.000
First Jeff's mouth may have
gotten him on the block.

03:44.000 --> 03:56.540
The question now is, can he talk
his way to safety?

03:56.540 --> 04:00.950
>> Now that Jeff is on the block
I know one thousand percent I

04:00.950 --> 04:01.990
made the right choice.

04:01.990 --> 04:04.990
Now I can sit back and hopefully
he goes home.

04:04.990 --> 04:10.950
>> Shocker of shockers, I'm not
on the block.

04:10.950 --> 04:16.410
So when awkward hugs start I'm
just trying to seem sympathetic

04:16.410 --> 04:19.830
when on the inside I am dancing.

04:19.830 --> 04:21.990
>> I hope you can respect it,
you know?

04:21.990 --> 04:24.990
>> Vanessa is trying to back
door me.

04:24.990 --> 04:28.990
It couldn't be any more evident
but this nomination is

04:28.990 --> 04:32.950
definitely lighting a fire under
my butt.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.540
I'm not going to go down without
a fight.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.990
>> Well I'm not surprised there.

04:37.990 --> 04:38.990
>> Oh, my God!

04:38.990 --> 04:42.990
>> Try to shake my hand.

04:42.990 --> 04:46.290
I hope you can respect it -- no,
no, I can't.

04:46.290 --> 04:49.990
>> Once again Audrey is not on
the block.

04:49.990 --> 04:50.990
I'm super annoyed.

04:50.990 --> 04:54.990
This chick has more come backs
than Cher.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.410
>> James you know I love you,
bro.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.990
I just hate that it's you.

04:59.990 --> 05:02.990
>> Dude, I hate it's you.

05:02.990 --> 05:03.990
Whatever happens, happens.

05:03.990 --> 05:08.410
If I go home I'm going to enjoy
the rest of my summer, trust me.

05:08.410 --> 05:10.990
>> I have hot chicks on the
other side waiting.

05:10.990 --> 05:13.990
>> You have even hotter ones
now.

05:13.990 --> 05:17.950
>> You have a whole new box of
crayons.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.990
>> I really wanted Audrey
sitting next to me on the block

05:20.990 --> 05:23.990
but Jeff sitting next to me
isn't a bad thing.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.990
I'm pretty sure a lot of people
are upset with Jeff and that is

05:27.990 --> 05:31.990
great which means that's great
he is the target and not me.

05:31.990 --> 05:36.990
>> I didn't want someone to pull
a bitch move and back door my
ass.

05:36.990 --> 05:40.990
>> Jeff going on the block is a
disaster for me.

05:40.990 --> 05:43.990
Jeff is the only person I can
trust in this house and he

05:43.990 --> 05:46.990
really deep down is my only
friend.

05:46.990 --> 05:48.540
So he will be getting my vote.

05:48.540 --> 05:51.830
>> I don't know at this point if
people would rather keep James

05:51.830 --> 05:54.990
in their house for their game or
me in the house for their game.

05:54.990 --> 05:57.990
>> That's what it comes down to.

05:57.990 --> 05:58.990
>> There's 11 votes.

05:58.990 --> 06:17.990
>> Well I have to figure out how
to get the majority.

06:17.990 --> 06:21.990
>> After everything Austin and I
have been through especially in

06:21.990 --> 06:24.990
the past couple of days, it's
50/50.

06:24.990 --> 06:27.990
>> I tell you one thing, I think
you already know it's better to

06:27.990 --> 06:29.990
have me here fighting on your
side.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.990
>> That's the conflict.

06:31.990 --> 06:32.990
That's what I'm think.

06:32.990 --> 06:36.990
>> If I could get you and Liz --
>> huge.

06:36.990 --> 06:41.990
>> Not only is it huge but I'm
almost positive I would be able

06:41.990 --> 06:43.990
to seal my fate here.

06:43.990 --> 06:44.990
It's your vote.

06:44.990 --> 06:44.990
Think about it.

06:44.990 --> 06:48.990
>> I'm going to think about it a
lot and I want you to keep

06:48.990 --> 06:50.990
reporting back to me and tell me
what is going on.

06:50.990 --> 06:52.990
If this is going to swing in
your favor I need to know.

06:52.990 --> 06:56.290
>> Even after everything
happening this week and Jeff on

06:56.290 --> 07:01.990
the block he still thinks I'm
his bro and I have his back.

07:01.990 --> 07:04.950
Jeff, it's because of me that
you might be going home.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.990
>> All I know is you will need
someone to fight for you and

07:07.990 --> 07:09.990
James is not going to fight for
you to stay here.

07:09.990 --> 07:14.990
>> I know.

07:14.990 --> 07:17.990
>> You know where these go,
these towels?

07:17.990 --> 07:19.120
Just anywhere?

07:19.120 --> 07:24.950
>> What are you making?

07:24.950 --> 07:27.990
>> I would just
I think we can trust James

07:45.990 --> 07:54.830
more, for sure.

07:54.830 --> 07:58.990
>> Oh, my God I just don't know,
your guys.

07:58.990 --> 08:00.990
I keep going back and forth on
it.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.990
But the long run, who do you
want to be put up against.

08:03.990 --> 08:06.990
I don't want to put up against
James.

08:06.990 --> 08:08.990
James would win the game.

08:08.990 --> 08:12.120
And Jeff probably couldn't win
the game.

08:12.120 --> 08:19.990
He would never -- he wouldn't
win against you or me.

08:19.990 --> 08:21.950
>> I get that too.

08:21.950 --> 08:25.990
>> I would like to get James out
because he's very like and I

08:25.990 --> 08:28.990
believe will just become more
and more popular in the house.

08:28.990 --> 08:32.990
On the other hand, Jeff, who has
been caught in a couple of lies,

08:32.990 --> 08:37.990
may still keep making himself a
bigger and bigger target as the

08:37.990 --> 08:37.990
weeks go on.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.990
>> I just can't decide.

08:39.990 --> 08:46.700
I just really can't.

08:46.700 --> 08:52.990
>> Dude -- I know I made
mistakes, man, and I'm sorry for

08:52.990 --> 08:53.290
them.

08:53.290 --> 08:56.290
You played too strong too fast.

08:56.290 --> 08:59.990
If you stay you have to change
your game.

08:59.990 --> 09:06.540
>> It took me being put on the
block to realize I need to start

09:06.540 --> 09:08.990
playing the game differently.

09:08.990 --> 09:13.830
>> Will you admit you did
campaign to get me out.

09:13.830 --> 09:14.990
>> I don't know why I did that.

09:14.990 --> 09:24.290
What I will say, dude, is I'm
not threatened by the fact you

09:24.290 --> 09:26.120
and shi are working together.

09:26.120 --> 09:31.990
>> Jeff did betray me and Shelli
and he breached my trust.

09:31.990 --> 09:32.990
But I do believe in second
chances.

09:32.990 --> 09:36.990
I'm just unsure right now.

09:43.990 --> 09:46.120
>> What's going on?

09:46.120 --> 09:48.000
>> I'm waiting to talk to you.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.990
>> What's up?

09:49.990 --> 09:53.990
>> I wanted to see where your
head was at.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.990
I know a lot has happened and we
haven't had much time to talk

09:56.990 --> 10:02.990
about a lot of things but what I
will say, Shelli is, if you have

10:02.990 --> 10:09.830
it in your heart to decide to
keep me, I can promise you that

10:09.830 --> 10:14.990
I'm going to play the game the
way that I started day one.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.990
>> Honestly I could have gotten
you really far.

10:18.990 --> 10:20.290
I would have done anything for
you.

10:20.290 --> 10:24.990
And you just -- you decided to
let that go, and I'm upset by
that.

10:24.990 --> 10:29.540
>> I'm sorry.

10:29.540 --> 10:35.990
I just got caught up.

10:35.990 --> 10:37.990
And I made some mistakes.

10:37.990 --> 10:41.000
But Shelli, I will go to bat for
you.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
>> I'm just struggling to find
out where Jeff is coming from

10:46.000 --> 10:46.830
now.

10:46.830 --> 10:48.830
Are his emotions genuine?

10:48.830 --> 10:50.990
Is he trying to sell something
to me?

10:50.990 --> 10:52.990
And should I buy it or not?

10:52.990 --> 10:53.990
>> I'm sorry.

10:53.990 --> 10:56.990
I know I messed up.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.990
I just think it's unfair to
Jackie.

11:00.990 --> 11:05.410
>> I want you to know that I
definitely don't want to send
you home.

11:05.410 --> 11:07.990
That's the last thing that I
want.

11:07.990 --> 11:10.990
>> Give me a hug.

11:10.990 --> 11:13.000
Come here.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.990
Come on.

11:16.990 --> 11:23.990
I know it sucks.

11:23.990 --> 11:29.990
>> I just had a very intense
conversation with her.

11:29.990 --> 11:42.990
>> Ok.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.990
>>
I had to try my hardest I would

11:45.990 --> 11:49.290
get worked up now to think about
sad things and start crying.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.990
>> When it comes to making a
sale, sometimes the best thing

11:51.990 --> 11:57.830
to do is to know your audience
and knowing that Shelli is an

11:57.830 --> 12:01.990
emotional player I had to play
into that and give her an

12:01.990 --> 12:02.990
emotional sales pitch.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.990
I'm hoping all of this hard work
pays off and keeps me in the
house.

12:06.990 --> 12:10.950
>> But I'm wondering, I am an
emotional guy like --

12:10.950 --> 12:14.990
>> if Shelli decides to keep
you, she had convince Clay --

12:14.990 --> 12:18.990
>> I just need to get Clay and
Shelli on my side.

12:18.990 --> 12:25.540
>> Holy crap.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.990
>> Julie: Up next -- does Jeff
have the votes to stay?

12:27.990 --> 12:31.990
The twins might be the key to
keeping him in the game.

12:31.990 --> 12:34.990
The third live eviction of the
summer is coming up.

12:34.990 --> 12:37.990
Stay with us!

13:06.290 --> 13:09.990
[ Cheers and applause ]
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

13:09.990 --> 13:13.990
As he continues to work the
vote, Jeff is pulling out all

13:13.990 --> 13:15.540
the stops.

13:15.540 --> 13:18.990
And an emerging love triangle
could either make him or

13:18.990 --> 13:21.990
break him.

13:30.990 --> 13:34.120
>> They knew that I switched on
Sunday.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.990
Because of the scar.

13:35.990 --> 13:37.990
Jeff notices your scar right
here.

13:37.990 --> 13:41.000
Jeff is on the block, he's going
to try to get your vote since

13:41.000 --> 13:43.990
you have been flirty with him.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.990
Obviously know your loyalties
Liz.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.990
>> We're not going to vote for
him.

13:47.990 --> 13:51.990
Be aware that the catalyst of
this whole twin thing from day

13:51.990 --> 13:56.990
one was Jeff.

13:56.990 --> 14:01.990
>>
>> toenails.

14:01.990 --> 14:06.990
>> I have pretty toenails.

14:06.990 --> 14:11.990
>> When it comes to the twins I
have a great relationship with

14:11.990 --> 14:15.990
both of them but I have a really
strong connection with Liz.

14:15.990 --> 14:17.000
>> Very nice toenails.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.990
>> They are nice.

14:19.990 --> 14:28.950
>> We put the green dress on.

14:28.950 --> 14:30.990
>> Ahh.

14:30.990 --> 14:31.990
>> We look so cute.

14:31.990 --> 14:33.990
>> You look nice tonight.

14:33.990 --> 14:35.990
>> Thank you.

14:35.990 --> 14:35.990
She is.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.990
>> Yes, she is.

14:37.990 --> 14:41.990
Very nice.

14:41.990 --> 14:52.990
>>
>> oh, no.

14:52.990 --> 14:54.990
Are you going to bed?

14:54.990 --> 14:55.990
>> I'm thinking about it.

14:55.990 --> 14:56.990
>> I love you.

14:56.990 --> 15:01.990
>> I love you, too, Liz.

15:01.990 --> 15:04.990
>> Easy over there, tiger.

15:04.990 --> 15:09.990
>> You're the one in bed with
her.

15:09.990 --> 15:10.990
>> Touche.

15:10.990 --> 15:15.990
>> Austin started out as an Ally
in my eyes and now that I see

15:15.990 --> 15:19.990
that the feel rehabilitation
growing, it's hard for me to

15:19.990 --> 15:22.950
just think of him as that.

15:22.950 --> 15:26.290
My mom always says girls and
guys cannot be friends,

15:26.290 --> 15:26.990
especially girls like me.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.290
>> That doesn't mean anything.

15:29.290 --> 15:29.990
Love, that's heavy.

15:29.990 --> 15:33.990
All right?

15:33.990 --> 15:37.120
>> Would you love me kicking you
out of the bed.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.990
>> Sometimes any heart takes
over and I'm a romantic person.

15:40.990 --> 15:45.950
When Liz is in the house, I'm
like just -- she's the only

15:45.950 --> 15:48.990
person I can see, which is a
problem.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.990
>> I'm making moves.

15:52.990 --> 15:58.990
>> You're making more moves than
I am.

15:58.990 --> 15:59.990
>> Oh.

15:59.990 --> 16:05.990
>> What is it going to do to get
with you.

16:05.990 --> 16:07.830
>> I missed you.

16:07.830 --> 16:08.990
>> Did you?

16:08.990 --> 16:15.990
>> I'm pretty confident that Liz
is a twin, and I definitely

16:15.990 --> 16:19.410
don't plan on blowing up her
secret in front of the entire

16:19.410 --> 16:22.990
house but why not have a private
conversation with her and see if

16:22.990 --> 16:24.990
I can work it to my advantage.

16:24.990 --> 16:28.990
>> Why are you being so rude
today.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.990
You never come around with me.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.950
>> Oh, my God gliecialtsz me.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.990
It might be the swing vote that
I need.

16:36.990 --> 16:39.990
>> You act so weird around me.

16:39.990 --> 16:41.990
I don't know if it's cute or off
putting.

16:41.990 --> 16:45.950
>> I know Julia told me to stay
away from Jeff but I feel like I

16:45.950 --> 16:50.990
can control him because I have
the flirt thing hands down.

16:50.990 --> 16:55.990
>> I generally want to help you
and help protect you but I know

16:55.990 --> 16:57.990
more about you than you think.

16:57.990 --> 16:59.990
>> Ok.

16:59.990 --> 17:00.990
So what do you think.

17:00.990 --> 17:03.000
>> You know exactly what I'm
talking about.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.990
>> No, I don't.

17:06.990 --> 17:16.990
>>
>> so you think I have a twin?

17:16.990 --> 17:21.540
>> I know you do.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.990
>> Who told you that.

17:24.990 --> 17:27.990
>> It's not like I'm asking you
to admit to anything.

17:27.990 --> 17:31.990
>> Well, I don't so --
>> you don't have to say

17:31.990 --> 17:32.950
anything.

17:32.950 --> 17:36.990
I don't think anyone is going to
ever come at you and talk to you

17:36.990 --> 17:38.990
about it because it sounds
crazy.

17:38.990 --> 17:43.990
>> It sounds crazy.

17:43.990 --> 17:53.830
>> I want to talk to you about
so much more but I can't.

17:53.830 --> 18:00.290
>> What is going on?

18:00.290 --> 18:02.990
>> Oh, geez.

18:02.990 --> 18:05.950
>> Austin would you like to hey
down.

18:05.950 --> 18:06.990
>> I just worked out.

18:06.990 --> 18:11.120
You know I have high
testosterone now and I'm going

18:11.120 --> 18:13.410
to start raging at people.

18:13.410 --> 18:16.990
>> Jeff looks like she going to
do number two in his pants.

18:16.990 --> 18:17.990
>> Don't worry.

18:17.990 --> 18:18.990
I'm not stealing your date off.

18:18.990 --> 18:19.990
>> That's all right.

18:19.990 --> 18:23.990
I know you're not.

18:23.990 --> 18:34.990
>>
>> I want some ice cream.

18:34.990 --> 18:43.990
>> I'm pissed off.

18:43.990 --> 18:44.990
Making it all uncomfortable.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.990
>> It pisses me off seeing Liz
allow Jeff to get to in her bed.

18:47.990 --> 18:52.120
There's a lot of rage in me
about it.

18:52.120 --> 19:00.990
>> Why did Liz go underneath the
covers with him like that.

19:00.990 --> 19:04.990
She's supposed to be trying to
avoid him.

19:04.990 --> 19:05.830
I don't know.

19:05.830 --> 19:07.000
I don't know what Jeff is doing.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.290
I don't like it.

19:08.290 --> 19:09.990
>> I know.

19:09.990 --> 19:11.990
What's she doing?

19:15.990 --> 19:18.700
>> She's trying to get me.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.990
>> You can't get emotional in
the game.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.990
That puts a target on your back.

19:23.990 --> 19:29.990
>> It's just like, what's that,
what is he doing.

19:29.990 --> 19:33.120
>> You know what he's doing.

19:33.120 --> 19:37.990
>> I'm a very emotional person
by nature.

19:37.990 --> 19:42.990
And ultimately, if it comes down
to it, I might sacrifice my life

19:42.990 --> 19:48.540
in this game to fulfill the
emptiness that has been in my

19:48.540 --> 19:50.700
heart.

19:50.700 --> 19:54.830
>> Obviously he was going to do
what he's going to do.

19:54.830 --> 19:56.410
>> But why did you let him?

19:56.410 --> 19:57.990
Why were you guys under the
covers together.

19:57.990 --> 20:01.830
>> He was talking to me and
there were two other people

20:01.830 --> 20:01.990
sleeping in the room.

20:01.990 --> 20:02.990
>> What was he saying.

20:02.990 --> 20:04.990
>> He asked me --
>> the twin thing.

20:04.990 --> 20:05.990
>> Yes.

20:05.990 --> 20:06.990
>> What did you say?

20:06.990 --> 20:08.990
>> I denied it.

20:08.990 --> 20:09.700
>> That's good.

20:09.700 --> 20:13.990
>> Why would he try to do that
right now, like that's going to

20:13.990 --> 20:14.990
help you vote for him.

20:14.990 --> 20:16.410
>> Did he blackmail you.

20:16.410 --> 20:20.990
>> I know Austin doesn't like it
but I think that I have more of

20:20.990 --> 20:22.990
a control and a connection with
Jeff.

20:22.990 --> 20:25.990
I feel like I can control him
more with the flirting.

20:25.990 --> 20:30.990
Austin thinks that Jeff is the
Kingman up later but I'm

20:30.990 --> 20:34.700
starting to think Austin is it
trying to manipulate me a little

20:34.700 --> 20:34.990
bit.

20:34.990 --> 20:35.990
I have news for you.

20:35.990 --> 20:39.990
Liz is not going to be
manipulated and I think Jeff

20:39.990 --> 20:41.990
could be used to my advantage in
this game.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.990
>> He's done.

20:44.990 --> 20:44.990
Say I'm not aware a.

20:44.990 --> 20:48.830
>> Julie: Coming up, James or
Jeff?

20:48.830 --> 20:52.990
Who will be the next houseguest
sent packing? And which two

20:52.990 --> 20:57.990
houseguests will emerge as the
new heads of head of household?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.990
Stay with us.

21:18.990 --> 21:19.990
[ Cheers and applause ]
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

21:19.990 --> 21:19.990
brother."

21:19.990 --> 21:21.990
James or Jeff?

21:21.990 --> 21:25.990
One of their dreams of winning
it all is about to be dashed.

21:25.990 --> 21:30.990
Let's head to the living room
and begin tonight's live vote.

21:30.990 --> 21:35.990
Houseguests, it's now time for
the live vote to begin.

21:35.990 --> 21:36.950
James?

21:36.950 --> 21:36.990
Jeff?

21:36.990 --> 21:40.990
In just moments your houseguests
will cast their vote to evict

21:40.990 --> 21:41.700
live.

21:41.700 --> 21:49.990
But before they do, you each
have a final chance to sway

21:49.990 --> 21:52.410
their votes with one final brief
statement.

21:52.410 --> 21:52.990
James, you're first.

21:52.990 --> 21:54.990
>> Jeff, you're great man.

21:54.990 --> 21:58.950
Sorry me and youened up on the
block together. I think you're

21:58.950 --> 21:59.950
a good person.

21:59.950 --> 22:02.990
To the houseguests, I love every
one of your guys.

22:02.990 --> 22:05.990
I learned something from each of
you.

22:05.990 --> 22:08.990
You make me laugh and smile.

22:08.990 --> 22:11.990
Meg I'm sorry I said you look
eccentric today.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.990
You are a smoke bomb.

22:13.990 --> 22:14.990
Please vote to keep me.

22:14.990 --> 22:18.950
>> Julie: Well you should get
Meg's vote after that.

22:18.950 --> 22:19.120
Thank you, James.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.540
>> Julie: Jeff, it's your turn.

22:21.540 --> 22:25.990
>> Well, I did not see this one
coming but I guess that's why

22:25.990 --> 22:27.410
they call it a blindside.

22:27.410 --> 22:29.990
I love all of your guys.

22:29.990 --> 22:35.830
Honestly we have been hilarious
times making fun of Meg, the

22:35.830 --> 22:37.410
Jeff and Austin show.

22:37.410 --> 22:38.410
It's been a blast.

22:38.410 --> 22:41.990
Vote for you and vote for
whoever is going to take you

22:41.990 --> 22:41.990
further in the game.

22:41.990 --> 22:47.990
At the end of the day a lot of
you will be in my position.

22:47.990 --> 22:51.540
Don't cry because it's over,
smile because it happened.

22:51.540 --> 22:54.120
Amanda, whas'sup?

22:54.120 --> 22:55.990
Hope your guys vote for me.

22:55.990 --> 22:56.700
>> Julie: Thank you Jeff.

22:56.700 --> 22:57.700
Thank you both.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.990
It's now time for the live
voting to begin.

22:59.990 --> 23:04.990
Vanessa, as head of household,
you are not allowed to vote.

23:04.990 --> 23:07.410
Neither are the two nominees.

23:07.410 --> 23:10.990
One at a time the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

23:10.990 --> 23:13.990
cast your vote to evict.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.830

23:15.830 --> 23:24.990

her amazing race partner Jeff

23:29.990 --> 23:33.120
and she has vowed to stick with

23:42.990 --> 23:45.990

24:23.990 --> 24:27.990
>> Julie: Meg has wavered on
whom to keep this week.

24:27.990 --> 24:33.990
But now, she must make a choice.

24:33.990 --> 24:34.700
Hi, Meg.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.990
>> Hi, Julie.

>> Hi, Julie.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.990
>> Please cast your vote to
evict.

27:40.990 --> 27:44.990
>> I vote to evict Jeff.

27:44.990 --> 27:45.410
>> Julie: Thank you.

27:45.410 --> 27:46.990
>> Thank you.

27:46.990 --> 27:50.990
>> Julie: It's official, with
six vo.Es to evict Jeff, Jeff

27:50.990 --> 27:54.990
will leave the house tonight but
let's see how Audrey votes.

27:54.990 --> 27:55.990
>> Hi, Audrey.

27:55.990 --> 27:57.120
>> Hi, Julie.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.990
>> Please cast your vote to
evict.

27:58.990 --> 28:00.990
>> I vote to evict Jeff.

28:00.990 --> 28:01.990
>> Thank you.

28:01.990 --> 28:13.990
>> Thank you.

28:13.990 --> 28:16.830
>> All of the votes are in.

28:16.830 --> 28:18.990
Let's give the news to the
houseguests.

28:18.990 --> 28:22.990
>> Houseguests, the votes are
in.

28:22.990 --> 28:26.990
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

28:26.990 --> 28:29.990
just a few moments to say
goodbye, gather his belongings

28:29.990 --> 28:31.990
and walk out of the front door.

28:31.990 --> 28:38.990
By a vote of 7-4, Jeff, you are
evicted from the "Big Brother"

28:38.990 --> 28:50.990
house.

29:22.700 --> 29:39.290
[ Applause ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

29:39.290 --> 30:16.990
>> Julie: Please, have a seat
.

30:16.990 --> 30:21.290
>> Julie: Jeff, that was an
emotional hug you gave on the

30:21.290 --> 30:25.990
way out to Jackie, you former
partner in the last season of

30:25.990 --> 30:27.990
thethe amazing race.

30:27.990 --> 30:32.950
You said win this thing you you
barely talked to her in the

30:32.950 --> 30:32.990
house.

30:32.990 --> 30:33.990
Do you expect her to win.

30:33.990 --> 30:37.990
>> I do expect her to and I want
her to win it.

30:37.990 --> 30:40.990
Jackie is literally the only
person I trust.

30:40.990 --> 30:43.990
>> But you distanced yourself
from her in the house.

30:43.990 --> 30:43.990
Why?

30:43.990 --> 30:45.990
We hardly saw you strategizing.

30:45.990 --> 30:49.990
>> The biggest thing was I knew
going inside the house that just

30:49.990 --> 30:54.990
by people knowing that jacky and
I were on the show, that we are

30:54.990 --> 30:58.950
going to have huge targets on
our backs and I wanted one or

30:58.950 --> 31:02.120
both of us to go really far so
as a part of my strategy from

31:02.120 --> 31:05.990
day one to create an illusion
that maybe Jackie and I weren't

31:05.990 --> 31:06.990
as close as we are.

31:06.990 --> 31:10.700
>> Well, she appears to be
floating in this house.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.990
I don't know how you -- how do
you think she is going to win

31:14.990 --> 31:14.990
it.

31:14.990 --> 31:18.990
I think she thinks it's a pit
stop on amazing race.

31:18.990 --> 31:22.950
She is not strategizing and she
is not building relationships.

31:22.950 --> 31:25.990
>> I would have considered
myself a floater and I'm sitting

31:25.990 --> 31:27.990
here and Jackie is still in the
house.

31:27.990 --> 31:29.990
So maybe floating is working for
her right now.

31:29.990 --> 31:32.990
>> You flirted quite a bit with
Liz in the house.

31:32.990 --> 31:33.990
>> Yes.

31:33.990 --> 31:36.990
>> Knowing Austin has feelings
for her.

31:36.990 --> 31:39.000
>> It's fantastic.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.990
>> Is it?

31:40.990 --> 31:44.990
Is it partly why you're sitting
here with me evicted tonight.

31:44.990 --> 31:48.990
>> I'm sure it has a big part of
why I'm sitting here.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.990
Really, I didn't hide the fact
that I was flirting with Liz.

31:51.990 --> 31:55.990
I would do it right in front of
him and smile about it.

31:55.990 --> 31:56.990
But he was creepy.

31:56.990 --> 31:58.990
Like, I don't know, he was just
creepy.

31:58.990 --> 32:01.990
>> You got four votes to stay.

32:01.990 --> 32:03.830
Four people chose to evict
James.

32:03.830 --> 32:04.990
Any guesses who they were?

32:04.990 --> 32:08.990
>> Well, I would think it was
obviously Jackie.

32:08.990 --> 32:12.540
Johnny mack, Becky --
>> no.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.990
>> Audrey?

32:13.990 --> 32:15.990
>> No.

32:15.990 --> 32:16.990
>> Liz.

32:16.990 --> 32:17.990
>> Liz?

32:17.990 --> 32:20.990
>> Maybe flirting helped.

32:20.990 --> 32:21.990
And Steve.

32:21.990 --> 32:22.990
>> Wow!

32:22.990 --> 32:25.410
Steve pulled out the fast one
for me.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.990
>> Do you want to hear your
goodbye messages.

32:27.990 --> 32:28.700
>> Let's hear it.

32:28.700 --> 32:29.990
>> Look over here.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.990
Watch and listen.

32:31.990 --> 32:35.990
>> Jeff, my man, this has been a
tough week for me and I don't

32:35.990 --> 32:37.990
think I took this decision
lightly.

32:37.990 --> 32:38.990
This is strictly a game move.

32:38.990 --> 32:44.990
At the end of the day I can't
let somebody target myself.

32:44.990 --> 32:52.990
>> Jeff, who would take hoh,
take a swing at their integrity

32:52.990 --> 32:54.990
and all I have to say is
goodbye.

32:54.990 --> 32:56.950
>> I can't believe you're gone.

32:56.950 --> 32:58.990
You're my only true friend in
the house and it's not going to

32:58.990 --> 33:00.700
be the same without you.

33:00.700 --> 33:03.990
>> Definitely going to kick ass
on behalf of team j.J.

33:03.990 --> 33:04.990
I will miss you.

33:04.990 --> 33:08.290
>> Jeff it's been fun playing
you.

33:08.290 --> 33:12.990
I know you thought I was your
boy but let me introduce you to

33:12.990 --> 33:14.990
my alter ego Judas.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.990
No one comes between me and my
twins.

33:16.990 --> 33:21.990
>> So you were giving me a hard
time about being a twin and I

33:21.990 --> 33:27.990
hate to admit it but you were
right.

33:27.990 --> 33:31.990
>> Sorry we had to vote you out
of the house but you are blowing
up our game.

33:31.990 --> 33:35.990
So I was flirting with you, but
see you in Florida!

33:35.990 --> 33:39.990
>> In the final seconds, your
reaction to Liz and her twin

33:39.990 --> 33:41.990
whose name is Julia.

33:41.990 --> 33:42.990
What do you have to say?

33:42.990 --> 33:43.990
>> I'm not shocked.

33:43.990 --> 33:44.990
I'm not surprised.

33:44.990 --> 33:48.830
You can hide it from me, I was
studying you for the last week.

33:48.830 --> 33:52.410
I already knew your guys were
twins.

33:52.410 --> 33:55.990
One was flirty with me, kept
touching my butt.

33:55.990 --> 33:56.700
The other one didn't.

33:56.700 --> 33:57.990
>> That might give it away.

33:57.990 --> 33:59.990
>> Stay right there.

33:59.990 --> 34:00.990
Don't move.

34:00.990 --> 34:05.990
Up next, the houseguests will
decide the next two heads of

34:05.990 --> 34:07.830
head of household.

34:07.830 --> 34:09.990
That live competition is next.

34:09.990 --> 34:11.990
Stay with us.

34:30.990 --> 34:31.990
[ Cheers and applause ]
>> Welcome back to "big

34:31.990 --> 34:32.990
brother."

34:32.990 --> 34:35.990
It's now time to crown two new
heads of head of household, and

34:35.990 --> 34:39.990
each will be charged with
nominating two houseguests for
eviction.

34:39.990 --> 34:44.990
Who will become the two most
powerful houseguests in the
game?

34:44.990 --> 34:47.990
Let's go to the back yard and
get things started.

34:47.990 --> 34:49.990
The power is back up for grabs.

34:49.990 --> 34:53.990
Vanessa as outgoing hoh you
are not eligible to compete

34:53.990 --> 34:54.000
tonight.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.990
This week you're going back in
time.

34:56.990 --> 34:59.990
That's right, everybody.

34:59.990 --> 35:02.290
It's '90s week in the "big
brother" house.

35:02.290 --> 35:07.990
It all begins right now as we
crown two new heads of head of

35:07.990 --> 35:08.700
household.

35:08.700 --> 35:15.990
Welcome to the set of our 1994
music video, we're calling,

35:15.990 --> 35:16.410
bustin' moves.

35:16.410 --> 35:18.990
Here is how the competition
works.

35:18.990 --> 35:22.990
You will watch two '90s dance
performances.

35:22.990 --> 35:25.990
After each routinely ask you a
series of questions about what

35:25.990 --> 35:26.990
you just saw.

35:26.990 --> 35:29.990
The answer will be either true
or false.

35:29.990 --> 35:32.120
Get the answer right, you stay
in the game.

35:32.120 --> 35:36.990
Get the answer wrong and you
will be eliminated.

35:36.990 --> 35:41.990
This will continue until we have
crowned two new heads of head of

35:41.990 --> 35:41.990
household.

35:41.990 --> 35:42.990
Does everyone understand.

35:42.990 --> 35:43.990
>> Yes.

35:43.990 --> 35:44.990
>> Excellent.

35:44.990 --> 35:46.990
>> Then here is your first
routine.

36:31.990 --> 36:35.990
>> Julie: Question one: True
or false: There was a total of

36:35.990 --> 36:40.540

36:43.990 --> 36:46.990
The correct answer is false.

36:46.990 --> 36:47.990

36:54.990 --> 36:58.990
Everyone reset as we move on to
question -- oh, and Clay.

36:58.990 --> 37:04.290
Sorry, Clay also got it wrong.

37:04.290 --> 37:04.990

37:04.990 --> 37:06.990
True or false.

37:06.990 --> 37:12.990
Of the seven dancers, only three
of them were men.

37:12.990 --> 37:16.990
Answers please.

37:16.990 --> 37:19.000

37:25.990 --> 37:28.990
Meg and Austin.

37:28.990 --> 37:29.990
Reset, Austin.

37:29.990 --> 37:32.990
Everyone reset as we move on to

first to place the boom box on
the floor.

37:44.990 --> 37:46.990
Answers, please?

37:46.990 --> 37:50.700
The correct answer is false.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.990
And a big congratulations to Liz
and Shelli!

37:53.990 --> 37:56.990
You are the only two to get that
right.

37:56.990 --> 38:19.540
The two of you ladies are the
new heads of head of household!

38:19.540 --> 38:23.990
>> Julie: So who will Liz and
Shelli target for eviction?

38:23.990 --> 38:25.990
Stay with us!

39:06.990 --> 39:07.990
[ Cheers and applause ]
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

39:07.990 --> 39:08.120
brother."

39:08.120 --> 39:10.000
Let's rejoin the houseguests.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.290
Hello again everyone and a big
congratulations to Liz and

39:14.290 --> 39:14.990
Shelli.

39:14.990 --> 39:15.990
Nicely done ladies.

39:15.990 --> 39:16.990
Liz I want to start with you.

39:16.990 --> 39:18.410
You have never opinion hoh.

39:18.410 --> 39:22.990
How does it feel and what are
you looking forward to from

39:22.990 --> 39:23.540
home?

39:23.540 --> 39:24.990
>> I am beyond excited.

39:24.990 --> 39:28.990
The most that I'm looking
forward to from home is a letter

39:28.990 --> 39:31.990
and I know my dad is going to
write it so I'm so excited to

39:31.990 --> 39:31.990
read it.

39:31.990 --> 39:34.990
>> And Shelli, you have been up
there before.

39:34.990 --> 39:37.990
What are you looking forward to
and how does it feel.

39:37.990 --> 39:40.990
>> Definitely another letter
from my family, more pictures.

39:40.990 --> 39:44.000
I want everyone to see my family
a little bit more and hopefully

39:44.000 --> 39:45.990
see my little puppy.

39:45.990 --> 39:47.700
I miss the little guy.

39:47.700 --> 39:48.950
>> James.

39:48.950 --> 39:49.990
Let me turn to you.

39:49.990 --> 39:52.830
You survived the block tonight.

39:52.830 --> 39:54.290
But there were four votes
against you.

39:54.290 --> 39:55.990
How are you feeling?

39:55.990 --> 39:57.990
>> I'm just happy to be here.

39:57.990 --> 39:58.990
Obviously I had four votes.

39:58.990 --> 40:00.990
I'm not worried about it.

40:00.990 --> 40:01.990
That's all behind me now.

40:01.990 --> 40:04.990
>> The game just go on.

40:04.990 --> 40:12.700
>> Jason, gronk had you guys
partying for 24 hours.

40:12.700 --> 40:13.990
What party was your favorite?

40:13.990 --> 40:16.700
>> I liked all of them.

40:16.700 --> 40:20.990
The least favorite was the one
where I fell on the shower

40:20.990 --> 40:21.540
floor.

40:21.540 --> 40:24.990
>> John I want to turn to you.

40:24.990 --> 40:29.990
After 29 days in the Big Brother
house what are you missing the

40:29.990 --> 40:32.990
most from home?

40:32.990 --> 40:39.990
>> Probably my guitar:
>> We might hold you to that

40:39.990 --> 40:42.990
finale need if we need some live
music.

40:42.990 --> 40:42.990
>> Bring it.

40:42.990 --> 40:46.990
>> The next question comes from
the audience.

40:46.990 --> 40:48.540
This goes to Audrey.

40:48.540 --> 40:52.990
An audience member wants to
know, who do you think is the

40:52.990 --> 40:59.990
messiest or who is the messiest
person in the house?

40:59.990 --> 41:02.990
>> -- Jeff.

41:02.990 --> 41:06.990
He gets a kick out of it.

41:06.990 --> 41:10.000
We spend 30 minutes cleaning the
bedroom and he spends two

41:10.000 --> 41:11.990
minutes destroying it.

41:11.990 --> 41:13.990
>> Julie: Is this what you're
look at home?

41:13.990 --> 41:19.990
>> Yes.

41:19.990 --> 41:21.990
>> I will turn to Clay.

41:21.990 --> 41:24.700
Clay, how would you say living
in the "Big Brother" house

41:24.700 --> 41:26.990
compares to being out on the
football field?

41:26.990 --> 41:29.990
>> You know there's a lot of
similarities.

41:29.990 --> 41:31.990
It's definitely crazy in here.

41:31.990 --> 41:37.990
It's hectic and the shower is
probably more disgusting than

41:37.990 --> 41:38.990
the showers there.

41:38.990 --> 41:39.990
>> Julie: That is bad.

41:39.990 --> 41:40.990
That is bad.

41:40.990 --> 41:42.990
>> It's very foul.

41:42.990 --> 41:45.990
>> Well, thank you, houseguests.

41:45.990 --> 41:48.990
And have a good night everyone.

41:48.990 --> 41:50.990
>> Bye Julie.

41:50.990 --> 41:55.120
>> Julie: Get ready for a week
of fun as the '90s continue to

41:55.120 --> 41:57.990
roll in the "Big Brother" house.

41:57.990 --> 42:01.990
