WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:01.690
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:01.690 --> 00:04.430
You'd be an outstanding
candidate for STA-21.

00:04.430 --> 00:05.590
Seaman to Admiral?

00:05.590 --> 00:07.580
- Pushing me for STA-21.
- I knew it!

00:07.580 --> 00:08.610
I haven't said yes.

00:08.610 --> 00:10.380
Oh, but you haven't
said no, either, have you?

00:10.380 --> 00:12.910
I'm sure you're looking forward
to being back with your team.

00:12.910 --> 00:14.200
I'm my own worst enemy

00:14.210 --> 00:16.010
when I'm away from my
brothers and out of the fight.

00:16.010 --> 00:17.280
You know, Sonny's back soon.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.900
And how do you think he's
gonna react to you and Reiss?

00:18.900 --> 00:21.560
'Bout as well as him reacting
to you going to STA-21.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.440
What we do here, that's what matters.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.700
I'm not saying it doesn't, J,

00:24.700 --> 00:26.230
just saying it's gettin'
harder and harder

00:26.240 --> 00:27.780
not to have my head back
home with the family.

00:27.780 --> 00:29.750
Where you hang your
helmet... that's home.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.810
Sidiqi IDed our Key Unknown.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.610
His name is Azfaar Al-Hazred.

00:33.610 --> 00:36.270
Related to Asim Al-Hazred.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.850
Yes. Azfaar is his only son.

00:37.860 --> 00:38.920
Doesn't matter who his dad was.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.150
Just another name on the list.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.570
Okay. We'll need
somebody at that meeting.

00:41.570 --> 00:42.740
Eyes and ears inside.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.260
Please. Leave me alone.

00:44.260 --> 00:46.800
Your on-base vendor
contracts are up next month.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.370
I'd hate to tell your wife and
son that you lost your business.

00:49.370 --> 00:50.660
You're not serious.

00:50.660 --> 00:52.340
You may have burned our informant.

00:52.340 --> 00:53.630
Now you're just being paranoid.

00:53.630 --> 00:55.770
The Army patrol we tasked
got back ten minutes ago.

00:55.770 --> 00:57.870
They found him in the market. I'm sorry.

01:04.340 --> 01:07.860
_

01:07.860 --> 01:10.380
_

01:10.390 --> 01:12.990
_

01:14.990 --> 01:16.990
_

01:24.400 --> 01:26.900
_

01:30.350 --> 01:34.170
_

01:34.170 --> 01:36.170
_

01:41.040 --> 01:45.840
_

01:48.890 --> 01:52.430
Next step in the Tahara
network's long-term plan.

01:52.430 --> 01:55.500
Azfaar Al-Hazred has taken
his father's legacy of violence

01:55.500 --> 01:57.000
to a whole new level.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.400
Boys as young as 12

01:58.400 --> 02:00.270
trained as soldiers and suicide bombers.

02:00.270 --> 02:01.700
Junior inherits his dad's bloodlust

02:01.710 --> 02:02.740
and forces it onto others.

02:02.740 --> 02:04.540
Some intensive indoctrination.

02:04.540 --> 02:07.040
Charlie Manson would be jealous
of that level of brainwashing.

02:07.050 --> 02:09.410
Al-Hazred Jr. has already recruited

02:09.410 --> 02:11.780
thousands of young fighters
from at least a dozen nations.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.670
Whole new generation of enemies.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.790
Junior is also using the family brand

02:15.800 --> 02:17.120
to appeal to the old guard.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.520
Former IS and AQ fighters
are pouring into Afghanistan.

02:20.530 --> 02:21.620
So where is he?

02:21.630 --> 02:22.720
Unlike his father,

02:22.720 --> 02:24.080
who was a visible figurehead,

02:24.090 --> 02:26.260
Azfaar has managed to
remain in the shadows

02:26.260 --> 02:27.800
while building and leading his network.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.100
Well, we like shadows.
It's where the fun happens.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.300
Unfortunately, we still
don't have a trail on Junior.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.900
So we're nowhere. That's
what you're saying.

02:33.910 --> 02:35.480
Agency's digging hard for leads.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.610
Till we have a place to
point the tip of the spear,

02:37.610 --> 02:38.710
we're in a holding pattern.

02:38.710 --> 02:39.980
Right. We're in a holding pattern.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.710
Just hurry up and wait

02:41.710 --> 02:43.310
while the clock's running
out on deployment.

02:43.310 --> 02:45.050
We all hear it loud and clear.

02:45.050 --> 02:47.050
That's all for now.

02:49.260 --> 02:52.320
Going after the son of the biggest
terrorist we ever took out...

02:52.320 --> 02:53.760
that's one hell of a double-tap.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.780
There's nothing biblical about it, Ray.

02:55.780 --> 02:57.440
He's just the next target, that's all.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.100
Don't give me that
"next target" chatter.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.100
You taking out Al-Hazred

03:01.100 --> 03:03.640
was one of the biggest milestones

03:03.640 --> 03:04.960
in the war on terror.

03:04.970 --> 03:06.250
I mean, i-it changed history.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.270
You gonna say it didn't change you?

03:07.270 --> 03:08.340
You know what? You're over-thinking it.

03:08.340 --> 03:10.470
No. This is our lives
come full circle, brother.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.810
You're just gonna shrug it off

03:12.810 --> 03:14.480
like it's some cosmic coincidence?

03:14.480 --> 03:15.510
It's war.

03:15.510 --> 03:17.250
I want to fight. Don't
want to talk about it.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.020
Maybe not talking
about it's the problem.

03:19.020 --> 03:21.750
Jace...

03:21.750 --> 03:23.790
13 years later, here we
are in the same place,

03:23.790 --> 03:26.790
fighting the second generation
of the same war. Wh...

03:26.790 --> 03:29.190
What's that say about our job, Jace?

03:29.190 --> 03:30.660
What's that say about us?

03:30.660 --> 03:33.660
Far as I'm concerned, not a damn thing.

03:38.290 --> 03:41.790

03:52.720 --> 03:54.050
You in?

03:58.160 --> 04:00.520
What in the hell you
boys sittin' around for?

04:03.320 --> 04:04.600
Thought we had a war to fight.

04:04.610 --> 04:05.630
Sonny.

04:05.630 --> 04:07.730
You survived summer school.

04:07.730 --> 04:08.990
I sure did. And, uh...

04:08.990 --> 04:12.240
I actually brought you boys back
some Horny Lizard Hot Sauce.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.670
I figured, you know, we could,
uh, fire up the barbeque and...

04:14.670 --> 04:16.370
I'm gonna go get a lift in, fellas.

04:16.370 --> 04:18.570
I'm tired of bleeding money.

04:18.579 --> 04:20.140
I'm out.

04:22.410 --> 04:24.080
Oh.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.080
Welcome back.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.020
Guess these dudes
really dislike hot sauce.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.310
Oh, wait.

04:31.310 --> 04:32.470
Maybe it's you.

04:32.470 --> 04:34.420
You know, I didn't expect
to see you here, Thirty.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.630
I figured my teammates
would've already fitted you

04:36.630 --> 04:37.760
for an iron maiden.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.400
- Mm.
- Mm.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.360
Sounds like something you
should be worried about.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.640
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

04:44.640 --> 04:45.990
Means...

04:45.990 --> 04:48.790
whatever napalm you
dropped before you left

04:48.790 --> 04:50.720
is still simmering.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.210
Hey, how's this stuff on pancakes?

05:07.090 --> 05:08.320
Crept out of my hooch

05:08.330 --> 05:10.130
to read intelligence
reports this morning?

05:10.130 --> 05:12.190
A lesser man would've been offended.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.930
I can't let the intel go cold.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.600
Just like that coffee
I hope you're holding.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.200
Hazelnut's in the left hand.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.350
Five times straight.

05:21.350 --> 05:23.490
I'm gonna need a psyops unit
to run some tests on you.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.880
Maybe you're just easy to read.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.380
What's new?

05:26.380 --> 05:28.610
Oh. Actually looking at what's old.

05:28.610 --> 05:30.380
The file on Al-Hazred Sr.

05:30.380 --> 05:33.250
I'm trying to retrace that manhunt.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.050
Son might be following
in the father's footsteps.

05:35.050 --> 05:36.150
Anything interesting?

05:36.150 --> 05:38.620
Well, there was a medical angle

05:38.620 --> 05:40.620
that the Agency pursued back then.

05:40.630 --> 05:43.630
Al-Hazred's wife had
a rare genetic ailment

05:43.630 --> 05:45.830
called "aplastic anemia".

05:45.830 --> 05:48.220
Required regular blood transfusions.

05:48.230 --> 05:50.470
So, the idea was to
trace those treatments.

05:50.470 --> 05:52.770
We might get pointed to their hideout.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.770
I don't remember this from
the books or the movies.

05:55.770 --> 05:57.270
Didn't lead anywhere.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.240
But, you know, a... maybe
a hereditary condition...

06:01.250 --> 06:03.810
Could be a thread to follow.

06:03.820 --> 06:05.280
It's a long shot, I know.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.440
Mm.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.410
Your instincts have been dead-on so far.

06:08.420 --> 06:09.790
I'll have Langley check into it.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.150
Thank you.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.320
Mm-hmm.

06:15.260 --> 06:16.260
How is she?

06:17.300 --> 06:19.000
Not great.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.930
But she knows that no
one could have prevented

06:20.930 --> 06:22.700
what happened to Samim.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.500
She told you that?

06:25.540 --> 06:27.540
We haven't had a chance to really talk.

06:28.850 --> 06:31.210
... but the senator's
microphone was still on.

06:31.210 --> 06:33.310
Everybody in the room
heard what he said.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.640
Some people think he was
set up by his own party.

06:35.650 --> 06:38.810
I thought the Taliban fought dirty.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.290
So, uh, what's going on there?

06:43.290 --> 06:45.320
Um, other than Sonny
coming back from Texas,

06:45.320 --> 06:46.820
uh, not much to report.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.860
Sonny's back?

06:49.860 --> 06:53.830
Means it's been six weeks
since you left already.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.300
That's, um...

06:56.300 --> 06:57.320
... the way it seems.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.730
Yeah, I know. For me, too.

07:01.570 --> 07:05.310
So, how did he take it when you
told him you were going STA-21?

07:07.810 --> 07:09.850
You haven't told him yet.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.880
Sonny was a lit fuse before.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.020
I mean... he'd explode
out here in the wild.

07:14.020 --> 07:17.020
Speaking of lit fuses,

07:17.020 --> 07:18.860
that letter about Ambassador Marsden

07:18.870 --> 07:21.060
has been getting a lot of attention.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.150
Oh, yeah?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.410
Can't get a drink in this town

07:23.410 --> 07:25.590
without hearing someone's opinion

07:25.600 --> 07:27.060
on who sent the letter to the press.

07:27.070 --> 07:28.760
I mean, whoever it was
that sent it, at least

07:28.770 --> 07:30.670
they set the record straight,
and that's what matters.

07:30.670 --> 07:32.770
This whole thing will
all blow over soon.

07:32.770 --> 07:35.100
You sure about that?

07:35.110 --> 07:37.710
You know how politicians
love the troops...

07:37.710 --> 07:39.610
until they start having opinions.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.520
What's going on here, boss?

07:49.520 --> 07:51.450
Whoa, wait a second, look at that, huh?

07:51.460 --> 07:54.460
Now right there is a
knuckle-draggin' sight

07:54.460 --> 07:55.520
for sore eyes.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.790
Sonny Quinn! Yeah!

08:00.260 --> 08:01.900
Look at you, you look good.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.760
Figured all those steers and
steins you're putting down

08:03.760 --> 08:06.050
you'd add a couple more pounds,
but you're trimming up, bud.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.950
I did a lot of running
to work off those...

08:07.950 --> 08:09.570
Texas-sized meals, you know.

08:09.570 --> 08:10.640
Yeah, but you know what?

08:10.640 --> 08:12.480
Lindell, right, he sends you out there

08:12.480 --> 08:14.780
to, to die, and you proved him wrong.

08:14.790 --> 08:15.840
That's all that matters.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.260
Yeah, but what Lindell did...

08:17.260 --> 08:18.980
Backfired... that's what happened.

08:18.980 --> 08:21.220
Backfired, 'cause you
came back stronger.

08:21.220 --> 08:22.750
I can tell in your eyes.

08:25.230 --> 08:27.260
Learned my lesson, Jace.

08:27.260 --> 08:30.920
And I'm ready to be whatever
next-generation SEAL

08:30.920 --> 08:33.400
Lindell and my teammates need me to be.

08:33.409 --> 08:35.299
Stop with that
"next-generation SEAL" stuff.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.230
I don't need one of my
operators playing nice

08:37.230 --> 08:39.710
with the shot-callers...
and cake-eaters.

08:39.710 --> 08:41.570
That's not you.

08:41.570 --> 08:44.980
What if that's what it
takes to stay on Bravo?

08:46.610 --> 08:48.940
You know, I-I learned
something in, in Texas.

08:48.950 --> 08:50.910
Yeah?

08:50.920 --> 08:53.280
Evolution is inevitable.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.620
It don't mean it's a bad thing, either.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.490
That's bar down.

08:57.490 --> 09:01.260
And I'm the one who decides
who stays in Bravo, okay?

09:01.260 --> 09:03.340
You and I, we're warriors.

09:03.350 --> 09:05.000
We cannot afford change.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.660
Can't, got it?

09:06.660 --> 09:08.610
Whatever you say, Jace.

09:08.620 --> 09:09.820
Come on, man.

09:14.010 --> 09:16.010
You think I'm pretty now, Metal,

09:16.010 --> 09:18.270
you should've seen me back
when we took out Al-Hazred.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.680
All this talk about him,
got me feeling like I'm 25.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.510
Well, how does it feel
to be a virgin again?

09:23.510 --> 09:25.810
Trust me, when it
comes to an op like this,

09:25.820 --> 09:27.350
you're the virgin.

09:27.350 --> 09:28.460
You have no idea.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.490
Taking out a target like his daddy.

09:30.490 --> 09:31.550
All that attention.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.960
Start to feel like a golden god.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.390
Ain't that right, Ray?

09:34.390 --> 09:37.040
I don't know about all of that, but....

09:37.040 --> 09:40.430
I will admit having your op splashed

09:40.430 --> 09:42.330
all over every front
page in the world...

09:42.330 --> 09:44.300
hard not to feel something.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.900
Yeah, immortal.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.970
Remember when we got stateside,

09:47.970 --> 09:49.370
that tear we went on?

09:49.370 --> 09:51.810
Some of the best times of my life.

09:51.810 --> 09:54.480
Yeah, I don't remember
those times so fondly.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.510
I already needed a
swift kick in the ass.

09:56.510 --> 09:58.150
All that attention didn't
help the situation.

09:58.150 --> 10:00.020
You know what I mean?
Took meetin' Naima to...

10:00.020 --> 10:01.680
bring me back down to earth.

10:01.690 --> 10:03.150
Yeah, pray I don't get cursed

10:03.150 --> 10:04.250
with that kind of redemption.

10:04.260 --> 10:05.650
The craziest thing is, is...

10:05.660 --> 10:06.960
all the stuff I did to change my life,

10:06.960 --> 10:08.160
it's Groundhog Day around here.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.260
New generation of evil replaces the old.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.200
Something inescapable about it.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.600
I'll be right back.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.830
Yo!

10:17.840 --> 10:19.370
- Yeah.
- Hey!

10:19.370 --> 10:21.600
- Hey!
- What?! What?

10:21.610 --> 10:23.610
You done lapped this damn
thing about eight times.

10:23.610 --> 10:25.010
Yeah, just staying primed, okay?

10:25.010 --> 10:26.110
- Nothing wrong with that.
- Nope, you're sharking.

10:26.110 --> 10:28.710
You haven't sat still since we
found out about Al-Hazred Jr.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.350
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what,
if we weren't overthinking it,

10:30.350 --> 10:32.050
maybe we'd have him in our
crosshairs by now, all right?

10:32.050 --> 10:34.220
All right, I need two volunteers

10:34.220 --> 10:36.890
to escort Agent Ellis
into the Bagrami District.

10:36.890 --> 10:40.060
She's delivering a condolence
gift to Samim's widow.

10:40.060 --> 10:42.020
Why are you sending Mandy?

10:42.030 --> 10:44.030
I'm not, she insisted.

10:44.030 --> 10:45.290
Pentagon signed off on that?

10:45.300 --> 10:47.760
Yeah.

10:47.770 --> 10:50.630
All right, well, you got your
first volunteer right here.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.430
Well, visiting a grieving widow
isn't exactly a Tier One op.

10:54.430 --> 10:55.740
I'll take what I can get.

10:55.740 --> 10:56.810
Trent. Let's roll, man!

10:56.810 --> 10:58.240
Kit up, you're with me.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.380
All right.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.980
What are you doing here?

11:06.980 --> 11:08.450
Security detail.

11:08.450 --> 11:11.890
Sending Bravo 1's a
little over the top, isn't it?

11:11.890 --> 11:14.660
I'm aware of that. But
it is a condolence visit.

11:14.660 --> 11:16.260
People react badly.

11:16.260 --> 11:19.960
$20,000. That's what they get.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.970
For losing a husband, a father.

11:22.970 --> 11:25.350
Not surprising people react badly.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.340
Right. Well, you know what?
You don't have to do this.

11:27.340 --> 11:28.600
You know? I can deliver that for you.

11:28.610 --> 11:31.610
I sent Samim into the lion's den.

11:31.610 --> 11:34.440
A man with no training, no protection.

11:34.450 --> 11:37.280
So if you think that this
is gonna be dangerous?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.120
Seems only fair.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.140
You know, deliveries like these
are like death notifications.

11:57.140 --> 12:00.340
Just make the formal apology.
We'll be in and out.

12:04.810 --> 12:08.250
You know, Mandy, just because Samim died

12:08.250 --> 12:10.920
doesn't mean what you did was wrong.

12:11.990 --> 12:13.390
Why are you here?

12:13.390 --> 12:15.390
I'm watching your six.
That's why I'm here.

12:15.390 --> 12:16.990
Bravo 1 leaving his flock behind?

12:16.990 --> 12:18.350
I can't remember ever seeing this.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.500
You're looking for a distraction.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.700
From what?

12:25.700 --> 12:27.900
I'm just doing my job.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.710
Hey, Lisa.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.540
Lisa.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.110
Ensign Davis.

12:36.110 --> 12:38.750
You know, you are a hard
woman to track down.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.450
Been busy.

12:40.450 --> 12:43.360
Look, t-that conversation I had
with you before deployment...

12:43.370 --> 12:44.750
You mean, that one about
you getting so drunk

12:44.750 --> 12:46.820
at the strip club, they had
to call me to come get you?

12:46.820 --> 12:48.770
- Yes. That one. Hey.
- Again? That one, okay.

12:48.770 --> 12:50.620
Look, you were right not to answer.

12:50.630 --> 12:53.210
I was a grade-A jackass
and I should never

12:53.210 --> 12:54.730
have treated you like that.

12:54.730 --> 12:58.130
You had a lot going on.
Lindell blindsided you.

12:58.130 --> 12:59.630
I hope being in Texas helped.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.300
It-it did, yeah.

13:01.300 --> 13:05.110
Saw some old friends and
I even looked up my dad.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.480
Can you believe it or not... Yeah.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.280
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.710
My God, it's been, like,

13:11.710 --> 13:13.210
how long since you guys saw each other?

13:13.220 --> 13:16.920
Too long. I should've
been back way sooner.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.860
But he... You know us Quinns,

13:18.870 --> 13:21.790
we're a couple of stubborn jackasses.

13:24.430 --> 13:28.820
Um, look, Sonny, I'm glad
everything went well there,

13:28.830 --> 13:31.830
but I got to get to work.

13:31.830 --> 13:33.840
Lisa.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.000
Is everything okay?

13:37.010 --> 13:38.570
Yeah.

13:38.570 --> 13:40.980
Good to see you back.

13:51.650 --> 13:53.290
Who's that you were talking to?

13:53.290 --> 13:54.960
Oh, it's just one of the operators.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.520
We've worked together for a long time.

13:56.530 --> 13:58.130
You got something?

13:58.130 --> 14:01.300
Yeah, Azfaar Al-Hazred's
medical history. You were right.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.760
He suffers from the same
anemic condition as his mother.

14:03.770 --> 14:06.840
And we've IDed the doctor who's
alleged to be treating him.

14:06.840 --> 14:07.870
That is huge.

14:07.870 --> 14:10.440
Yep. I've got contractors on
their way to talk to the doctor.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.610
- Now, as soon you hear anything, will you just...
- Lisa.

14:12.610 --> 14:14.110
There's nobody else I'd go to.

14:14.110 --> 14:15.680
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.680
Oh, my God.

14:25.020 --> 14:26.890
They roll out the welcoming committee?

14:26.890 --> 14:29.820
It's probably just friends
and family of Samim,

14:29.830 --> 14:31.830
guarding his wife and son.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.190
Just sit tight. Got it?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.000
They don't seem too alarmed we're here.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.400
You and GRS pull security.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.870
I'll take her in.

14:47.910 --> 14:50.140
No chances on this one, you understand?

14:50.150 --> 14:52.410
- Anything looks off, we're out of here.
- Roger that.

15:05.290 --> 15:06.990
_

15:07.000 --> 15:09.720
_

15:09.720 --> 15:13.070
Okay. You can't come in with me.

15:13.070 --> 15:15.000
They way they're sporting
their AKs like that,

15:15.000 --> 15:16.400
you're not going in without me.

15:16.410 --> 15:17.790
Well, she's in mourning.

15:17.790 --> 15:20.770
Muslim law says that the only
men allowed inside are family.

15:20.780 --> 15:23.540
You know we can't dishonor that.

15:23.550 --> 15:26.380
Stay close to the door,
so I can hear you.

15:58.650 --> 15:59.880
Sonny.

16:02.280 --> 16:05.220
Hey, man.

16:05.220 --> 16:08.220
I was literally about
to go eat with Cerberus,

16:08.220 --> 16:09.420
assuming he'd have me.

16:09.430 --> 16:10.790
I know what you're
going through, brother.

16:10.790 --> 16:12.760
- Oh, yeah?
- Leaving your family's always hard,

16:12.760 --> 16:14.560
but sometimes coming back
ain't no picnic, either.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.160
Hard feelings have a tendency to fester.

16:17.170 --> 16:21.300
Clay, I get. I do. I mean,
I practically accused him

16:21.300 --> 16:22.940
of ratting me out to Lindell.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.940
Practically, my caramel-colored
ass. You did that.

16:25.940 --> 16:28.410
All right, okay, I deserve...
Look, I-I screwed up, man.

16:28.410 --> 16:30.910
I did. I screwed up with
Clay, with the team and...

16:30.910 --> 16:34.180
I just got to take my-my
medicine and prove myself again.

16:34.180 --> 16:37.180
But I'll tell you what, man,

16:37.190 --> 16:39.350
this whole Davis giving
me a cold shoulder

16:39.350 --> 16:41.290
'cause she got some new man,
you know... I-I don't know,

16:41.290 --> 16:43.920
I just... I didn't expect that.

16:43.930 --> 16:45.430
Look, man.

16:47.430 --> 16:49.830
It's time to go.

16:51.270 --> 16:52.930
All right.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.700
A mission package has been authorized.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.340
So listen up. We may
have a live one here.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.870
This morning, intel discovered
a doctor who's been treating

16:58.870 --> 17:01.340
Azfaar Al-Hazred for a
rare medical condition.

17:01.340 --> 17:03.310
Agency contractors just
spoke with that doctor.

17:03.310 --> 17:04.849
We got a location on Al-Hazred?

17:04.849 --> 17:07.180
The doctor doesn't have
one, but Al-Hazred's

17:07.180 --> 17:10.310
been using this courier to
send him his medications.

17:10.310 --> 17:11.619
There happened to be a pickup

17:11.619 --> 17:13.349
just minutes before
our contractors arrived.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.220
The courier could lead us to Al-Hazred.

17:15.220 --> 17:16.490
Tell me we've got eyes on him.

17:16.490 --> 17:18.839
Also on the two armed
guards that are accompanying him.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.490
The target vehicle's
currently on its way

17:20.500 --> 17:22.030
to the mountain town of Surobi.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.940
We're big game hunting today, boys.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.920
Because following the courier becomes

17:25.920 --> 17:28.200
increasingly difficult
in that area's terrain,

17:28.200 --> 17:31.000
OGA's requested a tac team to
roll him up for questioning.

17:31.010 --> 17:32.810
We're short a few guns.

17:32.810 --> 17:35.980
Well, apprehending the
courier is time-sensitive,

17:35.980 --> 17:38.210
so the mission proceeds
without Jason and Trent.

17:38.210 --> 17:41.750
Perfect. Statler and Waldorf
would just slow us down.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.850
All right. Saddle up your team, Ray.

17:43.850 --> 17:45.420
- Let's go.
- Copy that.

17:47.020 --> 17:49.220
Doesn't feel right
going out without Jason.

17:49.220 --> 17:51.490
Yeah, his fault for running
out to play bodyguard.

17:51.490 --> 17:53.030
Besides, this one's cake.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.530
Hmm. Maybe not.

17:54.530 --> 17:56.400
The easy ones are Murphy's favorite.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.500
Plus, we got a new,
uh, new starting lineup.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.230
Easy there, Pippi Blondestocking.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.500
I am tight and Ray's got this covered.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.900
Yeah, you sure about that?

18:03.910 --> 18:06.020
Ten years ago, I would've
followed Prime-Time Perry

18:06.020 --> 18:08.080
into Hades for a ham sandwich.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.600
But this kinder, softer
Ray Perry I'm seeing today?

18:10.600 --> 18:11.700
Oh! Ho!

18:13.020 --> 18:15.050
All right, everybody dial it in, okay?

18:15.050 --> 18:17.130
No matter where Jason is
right now, whatever he's doing,

18:17.130 --> 18:19.420
you can guarantee that
his head is in it 100%.

18:19.430 --> 18:22.760
That's what I need
from you. Are we clear?

18:24.230 --> 18:25.290
We're clear.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.780
My name is Mandy Ellis.

18:37.780 --> 18:41.210
I'm a representative of
the United States military.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.650
I wanted to come extend our condolences

18:44.650 --> 18:47.990
on the death of your husband.

18:53.130 --> 18:55.600
I'm sorry, that's the
extent of my Pashto,

18:55.610 --> 18:59.670
but Samim's English was excellent,

18:59.670 --> 19:02.540
so I hope you understand me.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.640
Your husband was a very brave man.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.300
Samim was a man of strong beliefs,

19:12.300 --> 19:14.760
and the conviction to
stand up for what's right.

19:14.760 --> 19:19.520
He understood that change takes action.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.060
He was working with
us to make this country

19:22.060 --> 19:24.090
a better place for everyone,

19:24.090 --> 19:26.330
but especially his family.

19:36.270 --> 19:37.540
Hey.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.110
Your dad,

19:40.110 --> 19:41.880
your dad was a hero.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.010
Unfortunately,

19:44.010 --> 19:48.850
Samim lost his life in
service of that ideal.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.320
The United States is very grateful

19:51.320 --> 19:53.180
for his assistance.

19:53.180 --> 19:56.910
We would like to recognize
his service and his courage.

20:00.030 --> 20:02.900
I know there's no amount of money

20:02.900 --> 20:04.990
that can make up for your loss, but...

20:04.990 --> 20:06.600
This is why you came here,

20:06.600 --> 20:10.570
to pay me for the life of my husband?

20:10.570 --> 20:14.110
How dare you?

20:14.110 --> 20:16.110
Do you think I don't know who you are?

20:16.110 --> 20:20.150
Samim told me about you,
how you-you pushed him,

20:20.150 --> 20:21.440
threatened him.

20:21.440 --> 20:25.000
You are the reason my husband is dead!

20:25.000 --> 20:29.490
And now you-you come here
with your blood money,

20:29.490 --> 20:30.620
to pay me off?

20:30.630 --> 20:31.730
Americans.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.490
To you, Afghan lives are nothing!

20:34.500 --> 20:36.230
- All right, let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.430
That's it. Let's go. Come on.

20:37.430 --> 20:38.670
Let's go. We're going. We're going.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.000
- Let's go. Move, move, move.
- That night,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.400
the night your husband was murdered,

20:41.400 --> 20:43.640
- did you see anything? Do you know anything...
- Leave!

20:43.640 --> 20:45.210
... about how your husband was
killed? Did you see anything?

20:45.210 --> 20:46.730
- Move. Come on, come on.
- Okay, okay.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.410
Come on.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.580
In you go.

20:56.950 --> 20:58.150
You all right?

20:58.150 --> 20:59.990
- I'm fine.
- Let's move.

21:13.650 --> 21:15.400
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.

21:15.410 --> 21:17.170
I pass Shula. Over.

21:17.170 --> 21:19.950
Copy, Bravo 1. CTR shows

21:19.950 --> 21:22.840
what appears to be six fighting-age
males inside the target.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.110
Did he say six?

21:24.110 --> 21:26.150
If the courier has two guards,
then who are the other three?

21:26.150 --> 21:28.880
Are we gonna harpoon
the white whale right here?

21:28.880 --> 21:31.550
Guess Captain America didn't
get cast for the sequel.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.710
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.160
Is there any indication
our HVT is in there?

21:36.160 --> 21:37.660
Negative, Bravo 1.

21:37.660 --> 21:40.180
Ronin had a visual on all six occupants.

21:40.190 --> 21:41.530
HVT's not on target.

21:41.530 --> 21:42.960
That's a good copy. Bravo out.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.660
All right.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.900
So, let's go get the guy
that's gonna give us the guy.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.740
Hey, Ray? Something you got to see.

22:25.740 --> 22:27.070
Copy that.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.240
On the move.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.240
What do we got?

22:31.250 --> 22:33.410
Looks like HVT squirted off target.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.280
If we're gonna catch
him, we got to go now.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.840
Just one deployment, I'd like to skip

22:36.840 --> 22:38.730
the "Big Tour of Afghan Tunnels".

22:38.730 --> 22:41.250
Havoc Base, this is Bravo
1. Target house is secure.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.290
Courier and three tangos
are unaccounted for.

22:43.290 --> 22:46.290
We have a tunnel on target, but
we don't know how far it goes.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.460
We'll likely lose comms.
Permission to enter.

22:48.460 --> 22:50.360
Go ahead and clear it, Bravo 1.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.250
You've got a 60-minute window off comms.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.870
Then I am launching a QRF.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.410
Copy that. Bravo out.

22:55.410 --> 22:56.820
Brock, you're the lucky one.

22:58.970 --> 23:01.610
Okay. Go get it.

23:12.050 --> 23:14.870
You did the right thing.

23:14.870 --> 23:16.160
She was wrong, accusing you like that.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.590
No, everything she said was true.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.130
And it's fine.

23:19.130 --> 23:20.350
Mandy, come on.

23:20.350 --> 23:22.330
He died fighting for the greater good.

23:22.330 --> 23:24.160
So stop beating yourself up.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.170
I know.

23:26.170 --> 23:30.000
Sending Samim in was the best
way to get a lead on Tahara,

23:30.010 --> 23:33.440
and if I had it to do all over again,

23:33.440 --> 23:35.780
I'd do exactly the same thing.

23:36.810 --> 23:38.350
And that's what scares me.

23:38.350 --> 23:41.220
When I first started this job,

23:41.230 --> 23:43.920
losing a CI would have decimated me.

23:43.920 --> 23:47.020
And now, losing Dr. Craig and Samim?

23:47.020 --> 23:49.190
It's really hard, but...

23:51.630 --> 23:54.290
... I can pick up the
pieces and do my job.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.800
That's good.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.800
- Is it?
- Yeah, that's good.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.440
Somewhere along the line, I changed.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.340
Or maybe the job changed me.

24:04.340 --> 24:07.640
I don't know when it happened,
but I'm not the person I was.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.840
I understand that, but, you know,

24:08.840 --> 24:10.300
we keep marching into this hell.

24:10.310 --> 24:13.130
It's gonna have an impact on our life.

24:13.130 --> 24:15.820
That's the price we pay.

24:15.820 --> 24:19.690
And we've both convinced
ourselves it's worth it.

24:19.690 --> 24:22.460
No choice in duty.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.660
Is that what you think?

24:23.660 --> 24:25.660
Yeah. That's what I think.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.830
The hardest part now is...

24:30.830 --> 24:34.530
... knowing that I...

24:34.540 --> 24:36.700
I chose to become this person.

25:02.290 --> 25:04.020
Hmm.

25:04.020 --> 25:06.090
Looks like we got the five-star tour.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.320
The hell?

25:08.320 --> 25:10.630
Lot of tunnels have full-on
command centers in them.

25:10.630 --> 25:12.070
Some built by the Soviets,

25:12.070 --> 25:13.840
some financed by the CIA.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.840
Yeah, our tax-paying dollars

25:15.840 --> 25:18.170
are going to build
Jihad Johnny a Batcave.

25:18.170 --> 25:20.010
No computers. Looks
more like a way station

25:20.020 --> 25:21.210
than a command center.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.180
What do we got?

25:23.190 --> 25:24.420
Uh...

25:24.420 --> 25:27.090
You know what?

25:27.090 --> 25:29.060
If we're gonna get ambushed,
this is the place to do it.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.720
Brock.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.630
- Pull the dog.
- Roger.

25:32.630 --> 25:34.290
Spenser?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.230
You're the lucky one.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.200
Work for me.

25:51.570 --> 25:53.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up there, Frodo.

25:53.260 --> 25:56.580
Our little outing is about to
come to a premature conclusion.

25:56.590 --> 25:57.620
Spenser, what do you got?

26:01.720 --> 26:03.590
Stay-behind.

26:06.130 --> 26:08.560
Trip wire's running where
I can't see both ends.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.800
- We need an EOD tech in here, man, otherwise...
- Boom.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.470
Well, can we get around it?
We don't have time for this.

26:14.470 --> 26:18.010
No. These walls are too tight.
We got to turn back.

26:21.810 --> 26:23.080
All right, let's head topside,

26:23.080 --> 26:24.540
let Havoc know we're heading back.

26:24.540 --> 26:25.770
What, we're turning tail?

26:25.770 --> 26:28.670
We have no idea how far
these tunnels go, Sonny.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.240
That HVT could pop out three
hours or three days from now,

26:31.240 --> 26:33.410
and I'm not risking it with
that stay-behind. We're going.

26:33.410 --> 26:35.240
Okay, that little firecracker back there

26:35.240 --> 26:37.060
ain't no reason for us to about-face.

26:37.060 --> 26:38.200
All right? When I was in Texas,

26:38.200 --> 26:40.680
I took a six-week,
court-ordered demo course.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.650
You're telling me you
learned how to defuse

26:42.650 --> 26:45.360
- a stay-behind like that back at Laughlin?
- Yeah.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.980
Six weeks of demolition classes
doesn't make you an EOD tech.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.420
Okay, well, the longer
we sit around here jawing,

26:50.430 --> 26:52.660
the further away that
UPS guy's gonna get.

26:52.660 --> 26:55.850
I say we let Sonny go
ahead and play Hurt Locker.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.250
All we got to lose is him.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.470
Yeah, unless this device blows
and caves in the whole place.

26:59.470 --> 27:03.100
Well, I appreciate the
confidence there, Clay-mation.

27:06.510 --> 27:08.340
Don't make this your funeral.

27:09.250 --> 27:10.530
Roger that.

27:10.540 --> 27:12.890
All right. MSD is around the
corner at the other tunnel.

27:12.890 --> 27:14.090
Let's move.

27:16.320 --> 27:21.190
If y'all don't hear from me
in two minutes, wait longer.

27:29.330 --> 27:32.970
What in hell did you get
yourself into, Sonny Quinn?

27:36.240 --> 27:38.240
All right.

27:40.810 --> 27:42.210
Uh, yeah...

27:42.210 --> 27:43.640
Uh-huh.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.520
That right there is
just the anchor point.

27:53.690 --> 27:56.660
All right.

27:56.660 --> 27:58.490
Clear thoughts.

28:04.330 --> 28:05.670
No pin.

28:07.670 --> 28:09.540
Oh, a Mousetrap, okay.

28:09.540 --> 28:11.440
All right.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.670
We're good.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.380
Hello, pretty.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.010
You're gonna help me out today.

28:18.010 --> 28:20.010
That's right.

28:25.550 --> 28:27.590
Nice and steady, Sonny.

28:27.590 --> 28:29.060
Nice and steady.

28:38.700 --> 28:42.140
But wait, there's more.

28:42.140 --> 28:43.900
Okay.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.610
Goonies never say die.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.320
Oh!

28:56.320 --> 28:59.120
Oh...

28:59.120 --> 29:03.060
Nice and steady. Nice and steady.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.170
Oh, yeah.

29:18.170 --> 29:20.570
Nice work, Sonny. Okay.

29:20.580 --> 29:22.820
Other than my underwear,

29:22.820 --> 29:24.480
we're all clear.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.150
Copy that.

29:29.950 --> 29:32.190
That stay-behind cost us some time.

29:32.190 --> 29:35.090
We got to cut their lead,
so we can slow them down.

29:35.090 --> 29:36.660
One way to do it for sure.

29:36.660 --> 29:39.160
Yeah. We got the NODs, they don't.

29:39.170 --> 29:40.690
Damn right.

29:40.700 --> 29:43.000
We kill the lights, may as well
just announce that we're here.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.800
Yeah, we ain't never gonna surprise them

29:44.800 --> 29:47.470
if we can't catch them.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.770
Metal, make it happen.

29:50.770 --> 29:51.940
On it.

30:47.530 --> 30:49.330
Contact front! Contact front!

30:49.330 --> 30:52.230
What's this I hear, you
sending Bravo out without me?

30:52.230 --> 30:54.430
That's correct, Master Chief.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.490
I told you I'd be back in two
hours. Did you not hear that?

30:56.500 --> 30:58.020
Yeah, well, time was of the essence.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.740
We needed a tac team on
the target immediately.

30:59.740 --> 31:00.800
What's the target?

31:00.800 --> 31:02.710
A courier picked up
medication for, um, Al...

31:02.710 --> 31:05.170
for Al-Hazred Jr. this afternoon.

31:05.170 --> 31:07.760
Agency contractors tracked
him to a house near Surobi.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.410
Okay, so they rolled in to get him.
They should be back by now.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.400
- Target house had a tunnel.
- Had a tunnel?

31:12.410 --> 31:14.600
You sent them in? They could
be walking right into an ambush.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.520
Yeah, it's exactly what
you would have done, Jason.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.260
Relax. You know your
team, they've got this.

31:21.830 --> 31:23.660
- Push forward!
- Moving!

31:32.070 --> 31:34.580
- Eyes on the HVT!
- Moving!

31:37.380 --> 31:38.880
RPG, Sonny!

31:54.130 --> 31:55.360
Everybody good?

31:55.360 --> 31:56.700
- Yeah.
- We're good.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.900
- Sonny?
- Yeah, I'm good.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.370
All right, that's all of us.

32:00.370 --> 32:01.900
By the time we're back topside,

32:01.900 --> 32:03.430
that courier's gonna be long gone.

32:03.430 --> 32:05.620
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.

32:05.630 --> 32:07.540
Radio check, over.

32:07.540 --> 32:11.050
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.
Radio check, over.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.320
How many comms windows have they missed?

32:15.320 --> 32:16.950
I gave them 60 minutes.

32:16.950 --> 32:21.090
Unless we see a reason to cut
that short, they get all 60.

32:21.090 --> 32:23.340
You have any idea how many times

32:23.340 --> 32:25.180
I've had to trust you to find a way?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.460
Havoc Base, radio check, over.

32:29.470 --> 32:31.530
There goes our only lead on Al-Hazred.

32:31.530 --> 32:33.640
- Yeah, way to bring down the house, Bravo None.
- You know what?

32:33.640 --> 32:34.990
- Shut up!
- You just fumbled the ball.

32:34.990 --> 32:38.610
- I've had as much as I can take from you. Shut up!
- Hey! Hey!

32:38.610 --> 32:40.580
I got an idea.

32:42.110 --> 32:43.940
I'm gonna need a boost.

32:43.950 --> 32:46.110
Thirty, make yourself useful.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.650
Three, two, one.

33:12.640 --> 33:16.140
Havoc, this is Bravo 6. Do you copy?

33:19.740 --> 33:21.730
Havoc, this is Bravo 6. You copy?

33:21.730 --> 33:23.620
50 minutes of radio silence.
Do you know what?

33:23.620 --> 33:25.690
Call the QRF. Tell them
I'm coming with them.

33:25.690 --> 33:27.590
It's been 50 minutes.
They've got ten more.

33:27.590 --> 33:30.290
Ten minutes, that means
nothing, you know that.

33:30.290 --> 33:32.530
Havoc, this is Bravo 6. You copy?

33:32.530 --> 33:35.960
That's good copy, Bravo 6.
Give me a sitrep?

33:35.970 --> 33:38.290
Havoc, I'm gonna send you a signal here.

33:38.290 --> 33:41.460
Copy, Bravo 6. ISR is
searching for your signal.

33:52.620 --> 33:53.660
There.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.580
I've got your position
at three and a half klicks

33:55.590 --> 33:57.590
north of the target building.

33:57.590 --> 34:00.990
Track vehicles 270 degrees
from this position.

34:00.990 --> 34:03.090
We're tracking 270 degrees.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.890
Negative. Nothing but mountains.

34:06.900 --> 34:09.060
We let another one get
away. That's it, right?

34:11.070 --> 34:13.030
Stand by.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.840
This mountain's got an overhang.
It's shielding the road. Look.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.540
Bravo 6, this is Havoc Base.

34:22.550 --> 34:25.510
We just picked up two vehicles
traveling north from your pos.

34:25.510 --> 34:28.050
Hey. They got eyes on the courier.

34:28.050 --> 34:29.080
Yes.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.960
The boys pulled it off. Got the courier.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.060
Damn straight they pulled it off.

34:37.060 --> 34:39.460
I was expecting
a Challenger-level disaster.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.520
Still can't believe Quinn pulled it off.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.510
Yeah, with a mirror and a
damn toothpick nonetheless.

34:43.510 --> 34:44.630
Shapow.

34:44.630 --> 34:47.199
That must've been one hell
of a demo course, Sonny.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.230
Hey, I wasn't the one dangling 80 feet

34:50.230 --> 34:51.940
in the air without a net.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.570
Mr. Cirque du Soleil over here,

34:53.580 --> 34:55.310
he saved the op, didn't he?

34:55.310 --> 34:58.080
Damn straight he did.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.200
Top cheddar.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.940
All right, man. Good work, boys.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.930
Sorry I missed all the fun.

35:03.930 --> 35:06.060
I mean, it wasn't
exactly mission success.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.500
Goal was to roll him up, right?

35:08.720 --> 35:10.790
Don't worry about it, you
know? ISR's tracking him.

35:10.790 --> 35:13.120
He'll lead us right to
where Al-Hazred is hiding.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.010
Let's hope it pays
off with a target soon.

35:15.010 --> 35:16.160
Yeah.

35:16.170 --> 35:18.100
I will drink to that.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.400
Shapow.

35:20.900 --> 35:22.740
Hey.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.340
You handled your business today.

35:24.340 --> 35:25.670
Kept us locked in.

35:25.680 --> 35:28.010
Nothing to say about my
more kinder, gentler side?

35:28.010 --> 35:30.080
Well, Prime-Time Perry would have been

35:30.080 --> 35:31.510
so jacked up for action,

35:31.510 --> 35:33.780
that tunnel would have become our tomb.

35:33.780 --> 35:34.950
Nice work, brother.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.650
All right, let's bring it together.

35:39.660 --> 35:41.920
Come on, let's go. Ready?

35:41.920 --> 35:44.490
- Yep!
- All right. Here's to guns that shoot straight...

35:44.490 --> 35:47.630
... chutes that inflate,
and ops that go great!

36:07.120 --> 36:08.150
Davis.

36:08.150 --> 36:09.980
Sonny.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.620
I just wanted to

36:11.620 --> 36:14.620
to come by and let you know that

36:14.620 --> 36:16.860
you're the reason we got
a line on our target.

36:16.860 --> 36:19.650
Maybe. Courier's still traveling.

36:19.650 --> 36:21.010
Either way, it was a team effort.

36:21.010 --> 36:22.960
Yeah, that might all be true.

36:22.970 --> 36:26.170
But, uh, we couldn't
have done it without you.

36:26.170 --> 36:29.000
Yeah, it seems like you've really
found your footing here.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.210
Oh, sorry, I didn't...

36:34.220 --> 36:35.710
I didn't realize that
you were still working.

36:35.710 --> 36:36.910
Oh...

36:36.910 --> 36:38.080
No, it's fine.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.680
Sonny Quinn.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.910
Hey. Reiss Julian.

36:40.920 --> 36:45.020
Oh. I was just telling
Ensign Davis here thank you

36:45.020 --> 36:46.190
for, uh, saving our bacon.

36:46.190 --> 36:48.260
Yeah, yeah. Lisa has, uh,

36:48.260 --> 36:50.350
told me that you guys worked
together for a long time.

36:50.350 --> 36:52.740
Yeah. Yeah. That is true.

36:52.740 --> 36:56.230
And, uh, I really appreciate her, and...

36:56.230 --> 36:57.720
well, the whole team does.

36:57.730 --> 36:59.290
So do I.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.100
Uh, we were just about
to get something to eat,

37:04.110 --> 37:05.410
if you care to join us.

37:05.410 --> 37:07.440
Um... Yeah, I,

37:07.440 --> 37:10.780
uh, I really appreciate that. I-I do.

37:10.780 --> 37:12.750
But, uh, I have...

37:12.750 --> 37:15.350
uh, I got things I should do.

37:15.350 --> 37:19.290
Ensign.

37:19.290 --> 37:21.290
Quinn.

37:23.960 --> 37:27.360
- Shall we?
- We shall.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.630
After you.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.770
So you, uh...

37:40.780 --> 37:43.040
you learned how to
disassemble that stay-behind

37:43.050 --> 37:45.750
when you were back in Texas, huh?

37:45.750 --> 37:48.480
Are you saying I didn't?

37:48.480 --> 37:50.370
I'm saying I've been your wing man

37:50.370 --> 37:51.880
long enough to know
when you're full of it.

37:51.880 --> 37:54.460
Okay, well, I could have learned
how to do it in Armory school.

37:54.460 --> 37:57.120
- How 'bout that?
- Mm-hm.

37:57.130 --> 37:59.790
- You took a risk for the team.
- Yeah.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.130
- A big one.
- That's what Team guys do, ain't it?

38:02.130 --> 38:03.430
Help each other out.

38:03.430 --> 38:05.400
I thought you said Bravo wasn't worth

38:05.400 --> 38:07.470
- standing up for anymore.
- Well...

38:07.470 --> 38:10.270
one thing I learned in Texas was

38:10.270 --> 38:13.510
family might disagree, but in the end,

38:13.510 --> 38:14.840
it is everything.

38:17.750 --> 38:20.110
We good?

38:21.150 --> 38:23.280
Good.

38:27.660 --> 38:31.430
You know, this is, um...

38:31.430 --> 38:33.360
is gonna be my last
deployment with Bravo.

38:35.430 --> 38:39.100
- I'm going STA-21.
- Oh.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.770
Congratulations.

38:40.770 --> 38:44.640
I'm gonna miss the
hell out of you. I am.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.000
I ain't gonna cry, but I'm
gonna miss the hell out of you.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.410
And I tell you what. You and I...

38:48.410 --> 38:49.880
we gonna get drunk before you leave.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.880
Oh.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.520
I honestly didn't think you
were gonna take it this well.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.720
You know...

38:56.720 --> 39:01.150
seeing my dad again, it
made me realize that...

39:01.160 --> 39:04.160
people get called to
different things in life.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.120
And for me, Sonny Quinn...

39:06.120 --> 39:08.080
I'm a knuckle-dragging door-kicker.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.030
That is my destiny. Amen.

39:10.030 --> 39:14.500
But if you're being
called to something else,

39:14.500 --> 39:16.840
got to be true to who you are.

39:20.210 --> 39:21.880
I mean, brother,

39:21.880 --> 39:24.710
if there was any way
we could have held off

39:24.710 --> 39:25.910
until you got back, we would have.

39:25.920 --> 39:28.260
Yeah? Well, I'll tell you,

39:28.260 --> 39:30.620
part of it was my fault
for going AWOL with Mandy.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.390
You know, team was in good hands.

39:32.390 --> 39:34.390
You brought 'em home safe.
That's what matters.

39:34.390 --> 39:37.720
With Jameelah's "do not die"
order ringing in my damn ear,

39:37.730 --> 39:39.390
there was no other way
it was gonna happen.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.330
You know, Ray,

39:41.330 --> 39:44.160
you know, I never told you,
but you know, I really admire

39:44.170 --> 39:46.230
the way you balance your operating life

39:46.240 --> 39:47.700
with your family life.

39:49.170 --> 39:51.170
- Thanks, brother.
- Yeah.

39:52.410 --> 39:55.940
- I mean, it's not easy.
- No.

39:55.950 --> 39:57.540
And being around Thirty...

39:57.550 --> 40:00.010
you know, remembering
the Al-Hazred raid, and

40:00.020 --> 40:03.180
taking me back to that time when I
didn't have that balance... it...

40:03.190 --> 40:06.290
just all reminds me how hard
I got to work to maintain it.

40:06.290 --> 40:08.620
Yeah, well, you know what?

40:08.620 --> 40:10.530
That's what makes you a rare breed.

40:12.430 --> 40:15.600
I should be telling your ass I
don't know how you do it.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.130
- Hmm.
- Oh.

40:17.130 --> 40:20.470
J, I had to make a call
today with Sonny that,

40:20.470 --> 40:22.070
if it had went wrong, it...

40:22.070 --> 40:24.200
it would have haunted me
for the rest of my life.

40:24.210 --> 40:26.810
And if I had to make a
call like that tomorrow,

40:26.810 --> 40:29.880
and then another one
like that the next day,

40:29.880 --> 40:33.480
I'm pretty sure I'd lose sight
of what was really important.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.950
What are you saying?

40:36.990 --> 40:39.320
I lied to my daughter, J.

40:39.320 --> 40:42.920
That was the first time I've
taken a shortcut with my family.

40:44.630 --> 40:48.400
And I swear it'll be my last.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.760
Man, I thought I was
protecting her, but...

40:50.770 --> 40:54.330
if I hide who I am and
what I do from my family,

40:54.340 --> 40:56.500
what kind of father does that make me?

40:57.940 --> 40:59.740
I just...

40:59.740 --> 41:02.310
I'm starting to realize
that one of the reasons

41:02.310 --> 41:04.580
I've chose warrant officer
instead of running my own team

41:04.580 --> 41:07.980
is because I've seen the
high cost of being Bravo 1.

41:07.980 --> 41:10.120
I've seen the sacrifices
you've made for this team.

41:11.550 --> 41:14.520
Brother, it's taken a lot
of years, but I realized

41:14.520 --> 41:16.690
I'm just not capable of being all-in

41:16.690 --> 41:18.190
with the team the way you are.

41:18.190 --> 41:19.690
I mean, I love the team.

41:19.700 --> 41:22.500
It's... it's a big part of me,

41:22.500 --> 41:24.130
but so is my family,

41:24.130 --> 41:26.170
and I will not lose that balance.

41:26.170 --> 41:29.200
Tomorrow, I'm gonna be happy as hell

41:29.200 --> 41:32.170
when you come back
and take over Bravo 1.

42:37.110 --> 42:39.540
You okay?

42:39.540 --> 42:41.840
I'm good.
