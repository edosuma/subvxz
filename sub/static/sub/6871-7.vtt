00:19.801 --> 00:21.846
Ugh, yes I'll accept
the charges.

<i>[Archer coughing]</i>

00:23.215 --> 00:26.785
[Chuckling]
Goddamn, who is it? Cancer?

00:26.852 --> 00:29.821
I think it's Mr. Archer.
Hello?

00:29.889 --> 00:31.956
<i>[Archer] Carol, hey, shut up.
I need your help.</i>

00:32.024 --> 00:35.160
[Pam] And that's how you ask?
<i>Wait, Pam? Is that you?</i>

00:35.227 --> 00:38.163
- Yes. - <i> Great, shut up, because</i>
<i>I'm talking to Carol,</i>

00:38.230 --> 00:40.999
<i>and Carol, here's the deal--</i>
let me guess. You're all butt-hurt

00:41.067 --> 00:43.802
because Lana hired some
Pakistani dude to shoot you,

00:43.869 --> 00:46.738
so you went to Vegas, and now you're
drunk and broke outside a casino,

00:46.806 --> 00:48.740
and you want me to wire
a thousand dollars

00:48.808 --> 00:52.177
to buy you a plane ticket
and a pre-flight whore.

00:52.244 --> 00:56.114
<i>Okay, I'm gonna list everything you
just said that's totally wrong. A...</i>

00:56.182 --> 00:57.856
Not outside a casino, so...

00:57.976 --> 01:00.900
<i>Okay, it's gonna sound</i>
<i>like I'm hanging up? But--</i>

01:01.020 --> 01:03.888
No. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
C'mon, I really need your help.

01:03.956 --> 01:06.858
[Deep sigh]
Okay, where do I send the--

01:06.926 --> 01:08.793
[Chuckling]
Hang on! Make him beg!

01:08.861 --> 01:10.862
<i>Pam, goddamn it, I said shut up!</i>

01:10.930 --> 01:14.966
You shut up! Jesus, I'm sending you the
money for your stupid plane ticket!

01:15.034 --> 01:16.868
<i>Which would be great...</i>

01:16.936 --> 01:19.838
If I were not on the no-fly list.
<i>[Pam cackling]</i>

01:19.905 --> 01:21.773
<i>[Carol] How did you get
on the no-fly list?</i>

01:21.841 --> 01:23.007
Uh...

01:23.075 --> 01:25.944
[Grunting, straining]
Help! Get it off!

01:26.011 --> 01:29.047
[Grunts] I wanna fly the plane!

01:29.115 --> 01:32.016
You know, who knows? It's the government.
That's not important--

01:32.084 --> 01:34.919
What is important
is getting me home.

01:34.987 --> 01:38.123
Ugh, fine, then I'll send money
for a stupid train ticket.

01:38.190 --> 01:40.992
Which would also be great...

01:41.060 --> 01:42.927
[Grunting, straining]

01:42.995 --> 01:44.028
[Grunts]

01:44.096 --> 01:46.731
I wanna fly the train!

01:46.799 --> 01:49.595
Wow, I had no idea there
was a "no-train" list.

01:49.715 --> 01:51.059
<i>Well, neither did I,</i>

01:51.179 --> 01:54.839
but apparently there is, and before
you ask, the answer is no, Carol.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.373
A thousand times no.

01:56.493 --> 02:00.945
[Choking up]
I will not-- I cannot ride the bus.

02:01.013 --> 02:03.081
<i>Wh--?</i>
Stop! Goddamn it, I said no!

02:03.149 --> 02:06.751
[Unintelligible mumbles]
Simone, I swear to God, I will rub

02:06.819 --> 02:08.686
your own remaining teeth
in your eyes!

02:08.753 --> 02:11.122
[Mumbling, spitting]

02:11.190 --> 02:13.658
You ain't got...
[Mumbling]

02:13.726 --> 02:17.762
So. I don't care what it costs me,
financially or self-respectfully,

02:17.830 --> 02:19.998
but I need you
to do me a big favor.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.803
Oh, thank you!
Thank you, God!

02:25.871 --> 02:29.674
Yay!
Right? [Chuckling]

02:29.742 --> 02:30.909
Archer, you look like shit.

02:30.976 --> 02:33.111
And--
[Weary sigh]

02:33.179 --> 02:34.979
And obviously thank you, too.

02:35.047 --> 02:38.759

<i>All I needed was an airplane!</i>

03:20.926 --> 03:23.461
So why is it full of you idiots?

03:23.529 --> 03:25.563
[Chuckles] I wasn't going to sit
around the office all by myself!

03:25.631 --> 03:27.499
[P.A. dings]
<i>[Man] Because one of us needed</i>

03:27.566 --> 03:30.468
some multi-engine time
for his pilot's license--

03:30.536 --> 03:33.538
[Carol] And one of us would go pretty
much anywhere to piss off your mother.

03:42.615 --> 03:44.883
<i>No. I'll drink it neat.</i>

03:44.950 --> 03:48.686
And me and Krieger are all about
going to Branson! Booyah!

03:48.754 --> 03:51.554
And I assume Branson is some sort of
all-one-cares-to-eat establishment?

03:51.590 --> 03:53.691
You're kidding, right?
Say what?

03:53.759 --> 03:57.629
It's only the biggest country music
tourist destination in the world!

03:57.696 --> 04:00.465
Wait a minute, is this about Cherlene?
Who?

04:00.533 --> 04:02.634
She has no memory
of any of that.

04:02.701 --> 04:06.638
Wait, what? You don't remember being the
number one country singer in America?

04:06.705 --> 04:08.740
[Chuckling] Pfff, okay...

04:08.808 --> 04:11.576
Besides, Branson isn't
just country music!

04:11.644 --> 04:13.812
There's Tony Orlando,
Charo--

04:13.879 --> 04:16.581
the comedy stylings
of Yakov Smirnoff!

04:16.649 --> 04:18.616
How do you not know
about Branson?

04:18.684 --> 04:21.846
I guess the same reason I don't know
what grits are, or... hush puppies!

04:21.966 --> 04:23.144
Are you serious?
Oh, my God.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.690
Hush puppies are little balls
of fried cornmeal batter.

04:25.758 --> 04:27.759
Mm.
Not really, though.

04:27.827 --> 04:30.395
Well, and also shoes.

04:30.462 --> 04:33.865
Well thank you, Cyril. I was just
angry, now I'm confused and angry.

04:33.933 --> 04:36.801
[Dings] <i>Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

04:36.869 --> 04:40.438
This is captain Ray Gillette, welcoming
you aboard from the flight deck.

04:40.506 --> 04:42.574
Flight time to Branson
is about three hours.

04:42.641 --> 04:44.542
<i>[Archer] No it isn't!</i>
Shut up! And in the meantime,

04:44.610 --> 04:46.578
if you look out
the left side of the cabin--

04:46.645 --> 04:51.482
<i>you can just make out Nellis Air
Force base, home to... Area 51!</i>

04:51.550 --> 04:52.717
Wait, what?
Seriously?

04:52.785 --> 04:54.886
Hey, watch it! Ow!
Man, I can't see it!

04:54.954 --> 04:57.655
See what? What's Area 51?
What's Area--

04:57.723 --> 05:00.692
Are you shitting me?
Everybody knows about Area 51!

05:00.759 --> 05:04.362
Yeah, even me, and I didn't even know
they made shoes out of cornbread.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.498
It's where the government keeps all the
aliens that have crashed on earth.

05:07.566 --> 05:08.700
Well, allegedly, but--

05:08.820 --> 05:10.638
Oh, my God.
Cyril, shut up.

05:10.706 --> 05:13.641
Oh, so you believe
the United States government

05:13.709 --> 05:16.777
is actually harboring
extra-terrestrial life-forms

05:16.845 --> 05:18.746
at an air force base
in the Nevada desert.

05:18.814 --> 05:20.481
[Chuckling] No.
Ray!

05:20.549 --> 05:22.483
Get in closer,
I can't see jack dick!

05:22.551 --> 05:23.784
<i>No, this is good.</i>

05:23.852 --> 05:25.920
That airspace is all
extremely restricted, so--

05:25.988 --> 05:27.888
<i>[Pam] Oh come on, you pussy!</i>
<i>[Krieger] For the love of God, man!</i>

05:27.956 --> 05:29.657
Well, maybe a little closer.

05:29.725 --> 05:31.926
<i>[Archer] Whoa, hang on,</i>
<i>what're you doing?</i>

05:31.994 --> 05:33.961
[Chuckling]
And what are you wearing?

05:34.029 --> 05:36.831
It was in the crew locker.
I think it looks pretty sharp.

05:36.898 --> 05:38.632
Really?
<i>[Pam] Ray, get closer!</i>

05:38.700 --> 05:40.668
Pam, shut up!
<i>[Krieger] Make her!</i>

05:40.736 --> 05:43.938
- Look, Ray, I know you don't do well
with peer pressure-- - Wha-a-a-aa?

05:44.006 --> 05:45.973
Teacup pig.
Oh. Yeah.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.776
And how big was Li'l Hamlet when
you finally had to get rid of him?

05:48.844 --> 05:50.745
He was up there.
[Chuckling] Yeah.

05:50.812 --> 05:52.680
Like three hundred
shit-covered pounds.

05:52.748 --> 05:54.989
But seriously, Ray. Don't
dick around with the air force.

05:55.050 --> 05:58.753
That's a top-secret base down there and
they've got surface-to-air missiles, so--

05:58.820 --> 05:59.945
[Pam] <i> Ray!</i>
Pam!

06:00.065 --> 06:01.217
<i>[Krieger] Ray?</i>
Krieger!

06:01.337 --> 06:02.182
<i>[Everyone]</i>
<i>Ra-ay!</i>

06:02.302 --> 06:03.891
What? God--
Damn it!

06:03.959 --> 06:05.559
What?
That.

06:08.630 --> 06:10.831
Goddamn it.
Everybody hang on!

06:10.899 --> 06:12.666
[Everyone screaming]

06:12.734 --> 06:13.934
God damn it!

06:14.002 --> 06:15.836
I said, hang on.

06:15.904 --> 06:16.904
Ya know...

06:20.976 --> 06:23.644
[Screaming]

06:23.712 --> 06:25.713
Jesus Christ, Ray, do something!

06:25.781 --> 06:27.848
Besides fly the goddamn plane?

06:27.916 --> 06:30.751
Oh, you're already-- sorry, I didn't
know what the deal was, if you--

06:30.819 --> 06:34.622
I think I can land it!
But I gotta... put it down... at Nellis!

06:34.689 --> 06:37.725
Where the missiles are coming from?
It's either that or frickin' crash!

06:37.793 --> 06:40.728
Okay, sorry, just making sure there's
not a third option we haven't--

06:40.796 --> 06:42.530
Get out!

06:42.597 --> 06:45.533
[Screams, prayers, curses]

06:45.600 --> 06:47.468
Are we gonna die?

06:49.704 --> 06:52.973
Not today, gorgeous, not today.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.643
I mean, probably today,
but--

06:55.710 --> 06:58.779
[All screaming] Krieger!
Everybody! Calm down!

06:58.847 --> 07:00.681
Ray says he can
land us at Nellis!

07:00.749 --> 07:02.917
[Gasps]
You mean right at Area 51?

07:02.984 --> 07:05.786
Yes, Pam! Happy?

07:05.854 --> 07:09.134
I mean... yes?

07:12.647 --> 07:14.318
But who needs ice?

07:14.558 --> 07:16.726
<i>It's perfectly fine without ice.</i>

07:16.793 --> 07:20.596
Just ask Europe.
Lana?

07:20.664 --> 07:21.681
No?

07:21.801 --> 07:25.334
Come in dear, what're
you doing? Come in here.

07:25.402 --> 07:27.470
[Weary sigh] Hello!

07:27.537 --> 07:30.956
Hello dear, drink?
Uh, no?

07:31.076 --> 07:33.676
Well, you're not missing much.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.080
No ice.
Not a cube.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.514
And I can't wait to hear
her flimsy excuse this time.

07:38.582 --> 07:40.462
<i>[Soldiers] Get out the plane!
Put your hands up!</i>

07:40.517 --> 07:43.619
Get out of the plane now!
Let's go, let's move!

07:43.687 --> 07:45.621
[Moans and groans]

07:45.689 --> 07:48.758
Wow, those guys
look... furious.

07:48.825 --> 07:51.460
Yeah, no shit!
So thank you, Ray!

07:51.528 --> 07:53.562
For what, safely
landing the plane?

07:53.630 --> 07:55.941
What, like that cancels out getting
it shot down in the first place?

07:56.061 --> 07:59.023
You were the one yapping your damn
head off about my damn teacup pig!

07:59.073 --> 08:01.141
Who I hope to see
on my next BLT!

08:01.209 --> 08:04.978
Well too bad, because he...
went to... live on a...

08:05.046 --> 08:06.980
A farm! Exactly!

08:07.048 --> 08:09.897
So unless that farm had
a magical talking spider--

08:10.017 --> 08:11.084
[huge gasp]

08:11.152 --> 08:13.954
Yeah, they don't keep 'em
around for their milk.

08:14.022 --> 08:16.982
And I don't know that we're accomplishing
as much as we could be right now.

08:16.991 --> 08:18.291
[Banging, rattling]

08:19.460 --> 08:21.128
Hmm. How about now?

08:21.195 --> 08:23.130
Oh my God, I bet it's nerve gas!

08:23.197 --> 08:26.233
Just like they sprayed on Duddy Kravitz
in "Close Encounters"!

08:26.300 --> 08:29.236
Wait, what?
It's not nerve gas, you idiots, it's--

08:29.303 --> 08:31.972
You think the CIA's
above nerve gas?

08:32.039 --> 08:35.942
I-- holy shit, that's right, it's the CIA!
I've got Q-clearance!

08:36.010 --> 08:38.145
Wait, what?
What does that even mean?

08:38.212 --> 08:39.980
It means get naked.

08:40.048 --> 08:42.282
C'mon, let's go.
Gun's out, buns out.

08:42.350 --> 08:44.418
Don't shoot!
Hands up, everybody!

08:44.485 --> 08:46.253
[Archer]
We're coming out! Don't shoot!

08:46.320 --> 08:49.022
[Cursing and muttering]

08:49.090 --> 08:50.257
[Archer] Do not shoot!

08:50.324 --> 08:52.059
Guys, it's okay, I--

08:52.126 --> 08:53.260
He's got a weapon!
He's got a weapon! Gun!

08:53.327 --> 08:55.162
Q-clearance!
I've got Q-clearance!

08:55.229 --> 08:57.130
Seriously, is that
even a real thing?

08:57.198 --> 08:59.594
[Colonel] Q-clearance?
We'll see about that.

08:59.714 --> 09:01.234
What's your
authentication phrase?

09:01.302 --> 09:05.972
Sweet dash forty-four, tender dash
nine, hot dash juicy pork chops!

09:06.040 --> 09:07.974
I didn't pick it.

09:08.042 --> 09:11.737
Authentication checks out, sir.
Says here he's Agent Slater.

09:11.857 --> 09:14.014
Hmph! Well, Agent Slater!

09:14.082 --> 09:15.248
What? Who?
Agent Slater.

09:15.316 --> 09:17.918
Shut up.
How'd you get Slater's codeword?

09:17.985 --> 09:21.636
You mind telling me why in God's
green dick you were in my airspace?

09:21.756 --> 09:24.625
Well, our airspace,
for starters, right?

09:24.692 --> 09:27.261
Since I have
CIA clearance and all.

09:27.328 --> 09:30.364
And not that it's any of
your business, lieutenant...

09:30.432 --> 09:34.368
Colonel. Lieutenant Colonel, but
during transport of these prisoners--

09:34.436 --> 09:36.437
black site, pretty icky stuff.

09:36.504 --> 09:40.607
They attempted to overpower me, forcing
my pilot to make an emergency landing,

09:40.675 --> 09:44.611
but before he could radio your tower
for permission to land, boom!

09:44.679 --> 09:46.480
And then-- well,
you know the rest.

09:46.548 --> 09:47.815
Is this true?

09:47.882 --> 09:51.385
Uh--
He's Israeli! So, just Hebrew. Unless...

09:51.453 --> 09:52.856
<i>Reds Yiddish? Nisht?</i>

09:52.976 --> 09:54.655
So no, just Hebrew.

09:54.722 --> 09:56.623
Then how was he gonna
radio the tower?

09:56.691 --> 10:01.105
Which, I mean-- yeah, exactly, and
if I spoke Hebrew I would ask him.

10:01.225 --> 10:04.465
- Well-- - R-right after I ask your
wife and kids about you,

10:04.532 --> 10:06.700
but they don't know, they
haven't seen you in a year.

10:06.768 --> 10:08.469
They think you ran off
with a stripper,

10:08.536 --> 10:10.637
when in reality you are
literally climbing the walls

10:10.705 --> 10:14.508
of a farmhouse in Virginia
somewhere, out of your mind on LSD,

10:14.576 --> 10:18.312
compliments of the CIA and MK-Ultra.
Jesus Christ...

10:18.379 --> 10:20.747
So while you're finding me
a new airplane, Air Force guy,

10:20.815 --> 10:23.818
we're gonna need some sort
of shuttle to...

10:23.938 --> 10:25.677
I assume you have an officer's club?
Yep.

10:25.797 --> 10:30.283
Jeeps! Gimme two jeeps up here, on the
double! Jeeps, goddamn it, jeeps!

10:30.657 --> 10:32.693
<i>Shisn tsvey hozn mit eyn shos.</i>

10:32.760 --> 10:34.072
[Lana] I'm sorry?

10:34.192 --> 10:35.880
You're sure you
don't want a drink?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.898
Yeah, in the...
low nineties on that.

10:38.018 --> 10:42.214
Suit yourself. So. And how
is our little Abbiejean?

10:42.334 --> 10:45.904
Oh, yeah she's good,
great actually,

10:46.024 --> 10:47.574
and I'm really liking her nanny.

10:47.642 --> 10:49.075
Mm. Hispanic?

10:49.195 --> 10:51.396
[Sighs] She's actually Polish.

10:51.516 --> 10:53.034
Is that supposed to be better?

10:53.154 --> 10:54.615
What? No. They're both--

10:54.682 --> 10:57.584
Abbiejean. That's
from where, again?

10:57.652 --> 10:59.753
Again, it was
my grandmother's name.

10:59.821 --> 11:03.281
Hmm. You know what I think
would be wonderful?

11:03.401 --> 11:07.248
A border moat?
...Is if she had her grandmother's name.

11:07.368 --> 11:11.139
Well yeah, and obviously I talked
to my mother of god, you mean you.

11:11.924 --> 11:12.910
Thoughts?

11:13.030 --> 11:16.218
Because they don't have my brands, I
don't even recognize most of these.

11:16.338 --> 11:19.373
Well, maybe instead of worrying
about what cocktails to make--

11:19.440 --> 11:22.709
That's what I'm saying, Cyril. I don't
even know if I can make cocktails!

11:22.777 --> 11:25.746
What the hell's the air force spending
all those kajillions of dollars on?

11:25.813 --> 11:28.549
O'Dublin tequila?
I mean vodka, maybe.

11:28.616 --> 11:30.684
They obviously know their
way around a potato, but--

11:30.752 --> 11:33.883
My point... is maybe you should worry
about what's gonna happen to us

11:34.003 --> 11:35.854
when they find out
you're not Slater!

11:35.974 --> 11:38.156
Cyril, I should worry
about all kinds of shit.

11:38.276 --> 11:40.561
But you know what
they say about stress.

11:40.628 --> 11:43.247
[High-pitched alien chatter]

11:43.297 --> 11:44.430
C'mon, anybody?

11:44.498 --> 11:46.365
[Everyone screams]

11:46.433 --> 11:50.136
[Archer]
Exactly, the silent killer.

11:50.204 --> 11:52.238
[Gibbering]

11:52.306 --> 11:54.140
What?
What is wrong with you?

11:54.208 --> 11:57.076
Jesus, use your talking words!
Just slap her.

11:57.144 --> 11:59.278
[Pam]
Ho, ho, ho, holy shitsnacks!

11:59.346 --> 12:00.913
Did you guys see that?

12:00.981 --> 12:02.081
What are you talking about?

12:02.149 --> 12:04.217
It was, it-it-it--
Just slap him.

12:04.284 --> 12:05.918
C'mon!

12:05.986 --> 12:08.354
Uhh! Where are you going?

12:08.422 --> 12:10.389
Oh! Goddamn it.
Ya think?

12:10.457 --> 12:13.359
Yeah, it's worse than I thought.
[Coughs]

12:13.427 --> 12:15.061
We might even have
to use sour mix.

12:15.128 --> 12:18.197
I am talking about Pam
and Krieger running around

12:18.265 --> 12:20.299
a top secret military
installation in their underwear!

12:20.367 --> 12:22.401
When they're supposed
to be prisoners!

12:22.469 --> 12:25.892
Yeah that's no good, huh?
They'll probably shoot them on sight.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.974
[Short goofy laugh] Well?

12:28.041 --> 12:32.011
Well what, Cyril? Yes, obviously
I'm gonna go after them...

12:32.079 --> 12:34.981
[Pouring]

12:37.150 --> 12:41.153
So just calm down, do something
with your hands. Cut some limes.

12:41.221 --> 12:45.224
[Klaxon sounds]
<i>[Woman] Security breach, sector nine.</i>

12:45.292 --> 12:49.028
No, but seriously, Cyril.
Cut some limes.

12:49.096 --> 12:51.063
Like, six.

12:53.407 --> 12:56.814
Security breach. Sector nine.

12:56.934 --> 13:00.470
You think that's for us?
I don't know. What sector is this?

13:00.538 --> 13:02.162
What am I, this map?

13:02.282 --> 13:05.809
Oh wait. Aw crap,
this is totally nine!

13:05.877 --> 13:09.075
Eh, could be a coincidence.
Yeah, like just a fire drill.

13:09.208 --> 13:12.243
Although it's probably because they
found that poor kid you clobbered.

13:12.311 --> 13:16.147
You don't think I killed him, do ya?
What am I, a doctor?

13:16.215 --> 13:18.149
[Chuckling] Ouch.

13:18.217 --> 13:22.917
So, guess Pam came through here.
Jesus, it's like tracking a bear.

13:24.457 --> 13:26.856
Wait, you're breathing
though, right?

13:26.976 --> 13:28.259
[Groans]

13:28.327 --> 13:31.129
Attaboy, shake it off. Bet you
probably just have brain--

13:31.197 --> 13:33.098
[Soldier] Freeze!

13:33.165 --> 13:35.300
Hey, guys.
Drop it! I said drop it!

13:36.435 --> 13:40.171
[Glass clatters]

13:40.239 --> 13:43.108
[Burps] It was empty anyway.

13:43.175 --> 13:45.143
The weapon! Drop the weapon!

13:45.211 --> 13:47.545
[Laughing] What, on the floor?
Are you serious?

13:47.613 --> 13:51.182
So hey, you may not know this, since
I assume you get yours for free,

13:51.250 --> 13:53.218
but guns are actually
pretty expensive--

13:53.285 --> 13:54.385
I'm gonna count to three!

13:54.453 --> 13:56.221
Look, count to
whatever you want.

13:56.288 --> 13:59.257
[Lana] A hundred thousand.
Mm-hm.

13:59.325 --> 14:01.359
Dollars.
Mm.

14:01.427 --> 14:03.328
To name my kid after you?

14:03.395 --> 14:05.130
I think it's quite generous.

14:05.197 --> 14:07.298
I think it's quite
batshit insane!

14:07.366 --> 14:09.467
Well, I-- and Ron
can afford it and--

14:09.535 --> 14:12.170
I'm not selling you
the naming rights, Malory!

14:12.238 --> 14:14.172
She's not a frickin' bowl game!

14:14.824 --> 14:19.415
[Crying hysterically]
Oh... now...

14:21.180 --> 14:24.797
[Sighs] I mean, if it
means that much to you--

14:27.319 --> 14:32.557
I guess maybe Malory
could be her... middle name?

14:32.625 --> 14:37.228
Really?
Yes.

14:37.296 --> 14:40.650
Well, obviously that's not worth a
hundred thousand dollars, but--

14:40.770 --> 14:42.133
Fifty?
Pff!

14:42.201 --> 14:46.171
22.5, and I want a notarized copy
of the revised birth certificate

14:46.238 --> 14:48.273
on my desk by Friday.

14:48.340 --> 14:50.542
I--
Oh, and christen her in a white church,

14:50.609 --> 14:55.380
and I'll kick in five more.
Wow.

14:55.447 --> 14:59.450
Real life E.T.'s! My God, I hope we
find them. I have so many questions!

14:59.518 --> 15:02.749
Pff, like what, how to
build a better anal probe?

15:02.788 --> 15:05.684
Right? I bet their anal technology
is light-years ahead of mine.

15:05.752 --> 15:08.520
A light-year's
a unit of length, dipshit.

15:08.588 --> 15:10.522
Well, whatever then...
Parsecs.

15:10.590 --> 15:12.458
Length.
I-- hey ya know what?

15:12.525 --> 15:16.261
[Chuckling] I know how far light
travels in vacuum in a Julian year.

15:16.329 --> 15:17.629
[Alien] Ooooh!

15:17.697 --> 15:20.332
Very good, Pamela.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.603
I, that, my, I--
you know my name?

15:24.671 --> 15:27.573
Yes, Pamela.
And yours, Algernop.

15:27.640 --> 15:30.342
But, but, but-but
but-but-- English?

15:31.678 --> 15:35.280
Yeah, head. Head.

15:35.348 --> 15:37.674
Pam! I think
he means telepathy.

15:37.794 --> 15:39.932
Holy shit, like in scanners?

15:40.706 --> 15:42.040
[Krieger, aliens] No.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.103
No no no, wait!
I have Q-clearance!

15:44.223 --> 15:46.863
Bullshit. Firing in three! Two!

15:46.930 --> 15:50.390
No! Stop it! Look, I'm serious.
Just radio Lieutenant Colonel.

15:50.510 --> 15:52.030
He can straighten
this whole thing out!

15:52.144 --> 15:53.995
Lieutenant Colonel who?
What?

15:54.115 --> 15:56.839
Lieutenant Colonel who.

15:56.907 --> 15:58.603
Oh, my God!

15:58.877 --> 16:02.295
[Chuckling] Wow, all right,
this is pretty embarrassing.

16:02.415 --> 16:04.714
I thought that guy
was a lieutenant,

16:04.782 --> 16:06.957
and that his
last name was Colonel.

16:07.456 --> 16:09.252
In three! Two!
Wait!

16:09.372 --> 16:13.073
Goddamn it, look, I was just
trying to get home from Vegas.

16:13.924 --> 16:17.342
[Sighs] So okay, here,
you can have my weapon.

16:17.462 --> 16:19.089
But I do have some conditions.

16:19.209 --> 16:20.963
Uh, what conditions?

16:21.031 --> 16:23.599
Well... you're
not gonna like 'em.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.935
[Yelling, grunting]

16:38.455 --> 16:39.982
[Out of breath] Whew!

16:40.050 --> 16:41.658
And not to knock
the air force, but...

16:41.778 --> 16:44.214
[Chuckling] good thing you guys
have airplanes.

16:44.464 --> 16:46.272
I got a cousin in the Air Force.

16:46.522 --> 16:48.783
Brian. I should give him a call.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.070
Should we, uh...

16:51.309 --> 16:53.911
Guys, I really feel like
we should be doing something.

16:53.979 --> 16:56.380
[Carol] Ugh, we are...
[Gillette] C'mon, nothing by the drifters?

16:56.448 --> 17:00.084
The tams? The dominoes?
The embers? They call this "Classic Rock."

17:00.151 --> 17:03.053
Pff, what is this, Myrtle Beach?

17:03.121 --> 17:06.223
Ray. Is this Myrtle Beach?
No.

17:06.290 --> 17:10.060
[Both crying]
And that, my dear earthlings,

17:10.127 --> 17:14.098
is the key to understanding
the entire universe.

17:14.165 --> 17:17.201
Well, at least
as we understand it.

17:17.269 --> 17:18.969
Yes.

17:19.037 --> 17:23.941
[Choking sobs]
[Stuttering] Ta-take us... with you!

17:24.009 --> 17:26.242
[Archer] I will, if you shut up!

17:30.482 --> 17:32.283
[Babbling]

17:32.350 --> 17:35.185
What the hell, Krieger, did you
shove your dick in a socket?

17:35.253 --> 17:38.222
[Stuttering]
Did-did-- ow!

17:38.290 --> 17:40.391
Krieger, I am in no mood.
Now, get dressed.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.326
[Carol] Ugh, seriously?

17:42.394 --> 17:45.396
Yes, seriously. We're gonna
walk out of this building,

17:45.463 --> 17:48.432
into a hangar, and steal
an Air Force plane!

17:48.500 --> 17:51.928
And while we're doing that, I could do
with a whole lot less shit from you,

17:51.996 --> 17:54.364
Since all I wanted was a ride home!

17:54.432 --> 17:58.001
On my private jet.
Wh--? Yes!

17:58.069 --> 18:00.937
Can, can-can we talk for a second?
About what happened?

18:01.005 --> 18:05.108
Uh, is that before or after Krieger
sexually assaulted a two-twenty outlet?

18:05.176 --> 18:07.110
[Laughing] "Area 51".

18:07.178 --> 18:09.946
No! You guys!
I swear, they were--

18:10.014 --> 18:11.948
Pam! Seriously, get
your shit together.

18:12.016 --> 18:15.085
We have to go steal a plane from
the United States Air Force.

18:15.153 --> 18:17.087
[Motors droning]

18:17.155 --> 18:18.288
<i>Which...</i>

18:18.356 --> 18:20.924
not as hard
as I would've thought.

18:20.992 --> 18:22.359
Ray! <i> Wie geht's?</i>

18:22.427 --> 18:24.961
<i>Pff, darf min gehn in kolledj?</i>

18:25.029 --> 18:29.199
Yeah? You guys good?
If you want a drink, just-- wh--?

18:29.267 --> 18:31.732
Because it's just
de-icing fluid and Tang.

18:31.852 --> 18:35.005
Tell me!
Tell me you saw them!

18:35.073 --> 18:39.209
I-- Pam, I saw a blinding
white flash, that's it. No E.T., no Alf...

18:39.277 --> 18:42.012
B-but you believe me,
don't you?

18:42.080 --> 18:44.006
You believe
I'm telling the truth!

18:45.715 --> 18:48.985
Pam, the truth is out there.

18:49.053 --> 18:51.354
[Gasp] So you do believe me?

18:51.422 --> 18:54.958
[Laughing]
No! You stupid idiot!

18:55.026 --> 18:58.803
Alrighty then! I think I'm
sufficiently drunk enough, so...

18:59.060 --> 19:00.981
so who's up for Branson?

19:01.101 --> 19:03.316
