08:57.667 --> 09:00.333
LIKE THE "TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW
IN THE LOBBY" GAME.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.800
IF THE ARROW LANDS ON YOU,

09:02.800 --> 09:05.367
YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW
IN THE LOBBY.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.067
- FINE.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.300
I SAW THEM DO THIS.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.867
- THEY'RE SECRETLY DATING.

09:14.867 --> 09:16.200
THAT IS TOTALLY FORBIDDEN

09:16.200 --> 09:18.200
ACCORDING TO
THE EX-GIRLFRIEND CODE.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.467
- WE DON'T KNOW THEY'RE DATING.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:21.167 --> 09:23.600
I HAVE TO PROVE THAT HE
BROKE THE EX-GIRLFRIEND CODE

09:23.600 --> 09:26.867
BEFORE I UNLEASH
THE FISTS OF FURY.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.867
[grunting and screaming]

09:28.867 --> 09:30.867
ACCORDING TO
THE FISTS OF FURY CODE.

09:30.867 --> 09:32.200
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.467
- NO.

09:33.467 --> 09:34.667
- OKAY, FINE.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.167
THEN LET'S JUST PLAY
ANOTHER FUN GAME.

09:40.367 --> 09:42.367
- I DON'T LIKE THE
"PUT A TREE HAT ON

09:42.367 --> 09:43.700
AND HIDE IN THE BUSHES" GAME.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.467
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
OKAY, HERE COMES THE SHUTTLE.

09:51.867 --> 09:53.100
- THAT WAS VERY FUN.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.467
- AND LET ME SAY,
YOUR MOVES ARE VERY SMOOTH.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.633
- HE HAS TERRIBLE MOVES.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.800
- WHAT?
WHY ARE YOU PUSHING ME?

10:05.367 --> 10:07.533
KENDALL!
WHAT ARE YOU--

10:07.533 --> 10:10.033
- I'M PRETTY SURE
I SAW A TREE HAT WIGGLING

10:10.033 --> 10:11.533
OUT OF MY PERIPHERALS.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.433
THEY'RE ON TO US.

10:13.433 --> 10:14.467
YOU ARE PARANOID.

10:14.467 --> 10:15.900
- WELL, YOU WOULD BE TOO

10:15.900 --> 10:18.067
IF YOU WERE HIDING A TERRIBLE
SECRET FROM YOUR FRIENDS.

10:18.067 --> 10:19.867
WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER DONE THIS.

10:19.867 --> 10:23.267
- BUT KENDALL, DARLING,

10:23.267 --> 10:25.733
WE'RE JUST FIGURE SKATING.

10:25.733 --> 10:27.433
- SHH!

10:27.433 --> 10:28.967
SOMEBODY MIGHT HEAR YOU!

10:35.267 --> 10:38.267
- OKAY, WHAT IS
THE FIGURE SKATING CODE?

10:38.267 --> 10:40.600
- GROWING UP, HOCKEY PLAYERS
AND FIGURE SKATERS

10:40.600 --> 10:43.233
WERE CONSTANTLY AT WAR
FOR ICE TIME.

10:43.233 --> 10:45.033
AND THEY ARE AWFUL PEOPLE
WITH TOE PICKS.

10:45.033 --> 10:47.433
AND WE VOWED
NEVER TO FIGURE SKATE...

10:47.433 --> 10:48.600
EVER.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.833
- HEY.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.733
I'M A FIGURE SKATER,
AND I'M NOT AWFUL.

10:51.733 --> 10:54.933
- YES, BUT MINNESOTA PAIRS
FIGURE SKATING CHAMPS

10:54.933 --> 10:56.900
CHET AND MIMI CAMERELLI WERE.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.100
THEY CALLED US CAVEMEN ON SKATES

10:59.100 --> 11:01.667
AND MADE FUN OF OUR DULL
AND BULKY UNIFORMS.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.067
AND THEY SAID
THAT WE COULD NEVER

11:03.067 --> 11:05.067
DO A DOUBLE SOW COW
OR DEATH SPIRAL

11:05.067 --> 11:07.200
IF WE TRIED.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.067
- SO WHY ARE YOU FIGURE SKATING?

11:09.067 --> 11:11.933
- BECAUSE I VOWED
THAT SOMEDAY I WOULD PROVE

11:11.933 --> 11:15.100
THAT HOCKEY PLAYERS ARE
JUST AS GOOD AS FIGURE SKATERS.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.300
AND WITH YOUR HELP,

11:16.300 --> 11:18.933
I WILL PROVE IT
AT TOMORROW'S COMPETITION.

11:18.933 --> 11:20.933
BUT FIRST...
slam!

11:20.933 --> 11:23.267
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET OUT OF THIS CLOSET

11:23.267 --> 11:25.267
WITHOUT THE ENTIRE PALMWOODS
THINKING

11:25.267 --> 11:26.767
THAT WE'RE MAKING OUT.

11:29.267 --> 11:32.100
- WELL, THAT'S EASY.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.333
I'M AN ACTRESS.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.600
WATCH OUT, PEOPLE!

11:36.600 --> 11:39.100
GOT A BUSTED PIPE ON THREE!

11:39.100 --> 11:41.267
MOVE OUT OF MY WAY!

11:41.267 --> 11:42.500
- HUH.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.933
I DID NOT KNOW THE PALMWOODS
GOT A NEW JANITOR.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.733
- THAT WAS THEM, GENIUS.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.067
- WHAT?

11:55.267 --> 11:57.767
- OH, HOW COULD SHE
FORGET OUR CAMP MEMORIES?

11:57.767 --> 11:59.600
THE WAY SHE LAUGHED
AT MY VICTORY DANCE

11:59.600 --> 12:00.767
WHEN I WON THE SACK RACE.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.167
- NOBODY COULD BEAT YOU.

12:02.167 --> 12:04.800
- OR HOW I WOULD GIVE HER MY
PERFECTLY TOASTED MARSHMALLOWS.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.633
- YOU WERE THE BEST CHEF
ON THE LAKE.

12:07.633 --> 12:10.067
- AND THAT CAMP SQUIRREL
WE USED TO FEED...

12:10.067 --> 12:12.100
NUTTY CUMBERDALE.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.433
OH, AND WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME

12:13.433 --> 12:15.433
THAT WE ACCIDENTALLY
GOT OUR HANDS GLUED TOGETHER

12:15.433 --> 12:16.800
WHILE MAKING BIRDHOUSES?

12:16.800 --> 12:17.800
- [sighs]

12:17.800 --> 12:20.067
SHE WAS LITERALLY STUCK ON YOU.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.933
BUT I DID MY BEST TODAY,

12:21.933 --> 12:24.967
WHICH IS IN COMPLETE ACCORDANCE
WITH THE BEST FRIEND CODE.

12:24.967 --> 12:27.400
- BUT YOU HAVE NOT FULFILLED
THE TRY HARDER CODE.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.100
- WE DON'T HAVE
A TRY HARDER CODE!

12:29.100 --> 12:30.267
- OH, WE DO NOW.

12:30.267 --> 12:31.967
AND YOU'RE BREAKING IT!

12:31.967 --> 12:33.267
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

12:33.267 --> 12:35.433
TAKE YOU BOTH BACK IN TIME
TO WONKY DONKEY

12:35.433 --> 12:37.767
SO SHE'LL
FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AGAIN?

12:37.767 --> 12:41.533
both: WELCOME
TO CAMP WONKY DONKEY!

12:41.533 --> 12:44.100
* WHERE YOU'LL HAVE
A WONKY DONKEY DAY *

12:44.100 --> 12:45.367
HEE-HAW!

12:45.367 --> 12:47.433
- I MUST ADMIT,
I WAS A LITTLE INTRIGUED

12:47.433 --> 12:49.533
WHEN I GOT
A WONKY DONKEY INVITATION

12:49.533 --> 12:52.333
FROM THE ONE AND ONLY
NUTTY CUMBERDALE.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.333
- OOH!

12:53.333 --> 12:54.367
HERE IS YOUR T-SHIRT

12:54.367 --> 13:00.667
AND TODAY'S CAMP SCHEDULE.

13:00.667 --> 13:01.967
- SO GO GET CHANGED,

13:01.967 --> 13:04.667
AND GET READY
FOR A DAY OF WONKY DONKEY FUN!

13:04.667 --> 13:05.733
both: HEE-HAW!

13:05.733 --> 13:07.100
- OKAY.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.367
- MOM?

13:10.367 --> 13:12.100
I'M MATURE NOW.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.433
I'VE PUT DOWN COMIC BOOKS
FOR MAGAZINES,

13:14.433 --> 13:16.767
I USE YOUR CREDIT CARD
ALL THE TIME,

13:16.767 --> 13:20.567
AND I'M READY FOR THAT RECIPE.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.100
- FAMILY CODE SAYS
I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE RECIPE CARD

13:23.100 --> 13:24.400
UNTIL YOU'RE 21.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.933
- YES,
BUT IF YOU TELL ME THE RECIPE,

13:26.933 --> 13:28.933
THEN THE CODE IS NOT BROKEN.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.100
- WELL,

13:30.100 --> 13:31.933
IN THAT CASE...

13:31.933 --> 13:34.433
YOU TAKE TWO FRYING PANS,

13:34.433 --> 13:35.433
AND...

13:35.433 --> 13:38.433
clang!
[both screaming]

13:38.433 --> 13:40.933
- THAT WAS SO NOT COOL.

13:40.933 --> 13:43.733
- MOM, GUSTAVO NEEDS TO KNOW

13:43.733 --> 13:46.533
WHAT MAKES THOSE COOKIES
SO DELICIOUS.

13:46.533 --> 13:48.200
- THEN WE COULD MAKE SOME,

13:48.200 --> 13:50.400
AND HE COULD FOCUS
AND FINISH THE SECOND ALBUM.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.933
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE RECIPE.

13:51.933 --> 13:55.133
- TELL US YOUR SECRET NOW,
KENDALL'S MOM,

13:55.133 --> 13:57.433
BEFORE THIS GETS UGLY.

13:57.433 --> 13:59.467
- YOU WANT TO KNOW MY SECRET?

13:59.467 --> 14:00.667
FINE.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.833
THIS COLOR ISN'T REAL.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.267
SO NOW I'M OFF TO THE SALON.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.233
- HUH.

14:09.233 --> 14:10.833
LOOKS SO NATURAL.

14:10.833 --> 14:13.667
- YES, AND WHEN
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING,

14:13.667 --> 14:20.100
YOU TEND TO LOOK
TO MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.333
- LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!

14:26.100 --> 14:28.100
- GO!

14:28.100 --> 14:29.667
both: NO!

14:29.667 --> 14:32.067
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE CODE-BREAKERS.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.533
YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE COOL,

14:33.533 --> 14:35.100
BUT YOU'RE DATING
BEHIND LOGAN'S BACK?

14:35.100 --> 14:36.700
- WE'RE FIGURE SKATING.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.067
- OH, SO YOU'RE FIGURE SKATING
BEHIND LOGAN'S BACK AND...

14:39.067 --> 14:40.067
WAIT.
WHAT?

14:40.067 --> 14:41.067
- WE'RE NOT DATING.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.167
WE'RE SKATING.

14:42.167 --> 14:43.267
- THAT'S GREAT.

14:43.267 --> 14:44.467
I'LL GO TELL LOGAN.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.933
- OH, NO!

14:45.933 --> 14:48.633
BECAUSE THEN HE'LL KNOW
I BROKE THE FIGURE SKATING CODE.

14:48.633 --> 14:52.533
AND YOU CAN'T TELL HIM
BECAUSE OF THE NEW FRIEND CODE.

14:52.533 --> 14:54.100
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.067
I AM REALLY HATING THESE CODES.

14:56.067 --> 14:57.933
- WE JUST HAVE
ONE MORE PRACTICE,

14:57.933 --> 14:59.433
THEN THE COMPETITION TONIGHT,

14:59.433 --> 15:01.267
AND THEN WE'RE DONE
SNEAKING AROUND.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.667
- DON'T LEAVE THROUGH THE LOBBY.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.667
LOGAN'S HIDING
IN THE VENDING MACHINE AREA.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.500
- IN A TREE HAT BY THE FERNS?

15:07.500 --> 15:08.500
- NO.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.767
HE'S IN THE VENDING MACHINE.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.100
- JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT!

15:21.767 --> 15:23.200
kids: * CAMP WONKY DONKEY

15:23.200 --> 15:24.933

16:38.800 --> 16:42.267
AND AFTER TONIGHT YOU'LL NEVER
SEE THEM SNEAKING AROUND AGAIN.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.267
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

16:44.267 --> 16:46.067
YOU HAVE A SECRET.

16:46.067 --> 16:48.767
REVEAL IT, BY THE ORDER OF
THE REVEAL IT CODE.

16:48.767 --> 16:50.300
- YEAH, WELL, I CAN'T,

16:50.300 --> 16:53.100
BECAUSE OF THE STUPID
NEW FRIEND CODE.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.100
- YOU'RE IN ON IT.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.433
- I'M NOT IN ON ANYTHING,

16:55.433 --> 16:57.333
EXCEPT REALIZING
YOU'RE ALL WEIRD.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.567
- YOU SEEN YOUR HAIR LATELY?

16:59.567 --> 17:02.333
AND...

17:02.333 --> 17:05.833
I'M BORROWING THIS.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.400
[laughs maniacally]

17:09.233 --> 17:10.467
- HEY.

17:10.467 --> 17:12.100
TRY AND AVOID THE LOBBY
WHEN YOU COME BACK.

17:12.100 --> 17:15.467
THERE'S AN AX-WIELDING MANIAC
LOOKING FOR YOU.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.200
ding!
- GO!

17:17.200 --> 17:18.933
TAKE THE STAIRS!
TAKE THE STAIRS!

17:18.933 --> 17:20.433
- BOO!

17:20.433 --> 17:22.267
[screaming]

17:22.267 --> 17:25.433
[crowd screaming]

17:25.433 --> 17:28.433
ding!
- COOKIE TIME!

17:28.433 --> 17:29.600
- WE WIN!

17:29.600 --> 17:32.267
YOUR MOM LOSES.

17:32.267 --> 17:36.433
[laughs maniacally]

17:36.433 --> 17:40.867
[spitting and shrieking]

17:40.867 --> 17:43.167
- OH, HOW'S THE BAKING GOING?

17:43.167 --> 17:45.333
- YOU PLANTED
A FAKE RECIPE CARD?

17:45.333 --> 17:46.500
- YEAH.
- [sighs]

17:46.500 --> 17:48.300
I TOLD YOU THE BOTTLE CAPS
AND TOOTHPASTE

17:48.300 --> 17:49.600
DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.433
- WELL, IF I DIDN'T
PLANT A FAKE RECIPE CARD,

17:51.433 --> 17:54.067
YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE TORN UP THE
WHOLE APARTMENT LOOKING FOR IT,

17:54.067 --> 17:55.600
AND THEN
I'D HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.733
- OH, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

17:56.733 --> 17:57.733
- YES, IT IS.
- [stammers]

17:57.733 --> 17:59.133
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S TRUE.

17:59.133 --> 18:01.533
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE NEED
TO FINISH THE SECOND ALBUM.

18:01.533 --> 18:03.067
AND WE CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOUR RECIPE.

18:03.067 --> 18:05.133
- AND YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING
HOW WE'RE FAMILY,

18:05.133 --> 18:07.800
SO WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE US THE SECRET FAMILY RECIPE

18:07.800 --> 18:09.667
BECAUSE I'M OVER 21!

18:09.667 --> 18:14.100
- IF YOU WANT ME TO BE NICER,
YOU SHOULD SET A BETTER EXAMPLE.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.433
- FINE.

18:15.433 --> 18:16.667
UGH!

READY-MADE SNICKERDOODLE DOUGH

18:20.600 --> 18:22.933
AND ADD SUGAR.

18:22.933 --> 18:25.967
- OKAY,
HOW IS THAT A SECRET RECIPE?

18:25.967 --> 18:28.433
- THE SECRET IS...

18:28.433 --> 18:30.867
I FORGOT ABOUT
A PEEWEE HOCKEY BAKE SALE.

18:30.867 --> 18:33.100
SO I BOUGHT THIS, ADDED THIS,

18:33.100 --> 18:34.600
AND THEN EVERYBODY
WANTED MY RECIPE,

18:34.600 --> 18:37.433
SO I MADE UP THE PART
ABOUT THE SECRET FAMILY RECIPE

18:37.433 --> 18:40.367
BECAUSE I'M A LOSER, OKAY?

18:40.367 --> 18:43.400
- YOU ADD A WHOLE BAG OF SUGAR?

18:43.400 --> 18:44.867

18:47.433 --> 18:49.067
- WE CAN FINISH THE ALBUM!

18:50.433 --> 18:52.267

18:57.267 --> 18:58.267
YOUR BIRDHOUSE...

18:58.267 --> 19:01.967
WHICH IS
STILL A LITTLE BIT STICKY.

19:01.967 --> 19:04.833
- WE HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME.

19:04.833 --> 19:07.500
- WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO GO BACK

19:13.167 --> 19:15.500

19:15.500 --> 19:17.600
