<i>Go! Go! Go!!</i>

05:57.299 --> 05:59.668
Hey. Hey.

05:59.669 --> 06:02.436
A thousand bucks.
I won a thousand bucks.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.839
Yeah?

06:05.174 --> 06:06.440
Heads up.

06:10.512 --> 06:13.447
A thousand bucks, man.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.960
Did you keep that?
I saw you keep that.

06:29.598 --> 06:33.836
That lottery ticket's about as useful
as your fuckin' hair gel Mickey.

06:36.205 --> 06:37.939
Hey man, let's have a catch.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.609
<i>- Nah. I don't feel like it.
- Aw, come on.</i>

06:40.610 --> 06:41.844
Let's work on that curveball, huh?

06:41.845 --> 06:44.378
<i>Yeah and what's a
curveball useful for?</i>

06:44.446 --> 06:46.714
Uh, it's fun man.

06:46.715 --> 06:49.151
It's baseball. We love
baseball, remember?

06:54.023 --> 06:55.122
Yeah.

06:56.091 --> 06:58.961
Okay no uh...

06:58.962 --> 07:00.729
no shorties, I'm not wearing a cup.

07:00.730 --> 07:05.033
None of this 57-foot
slider bullshit.

07:05.034 --> 07:07.937
You know, in Latin America, they
don't let kids throw curveballs.

07:07.938 --> 07:09.871
They teach them the changeup.

07:09.872 --> 07:13.341
It's a lot easier on the
shoulder, but just as effective.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.680
Was that your changeup?

07:19.815 --> 07:22.051
You don't have a changeup either.

07:22.052 --> 07:24.285
You're a one pitch bitch, Mickey.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.355
'One Pitch Bitch Mickey!'

07:29.892 --> 07:32.526
Hell of a pitch, though.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.359
Hey Mick.

09:12.694 --> 09:14.295
Wanna fish for a while?

09:15.164 --> 09:16.130
What?

09:17.366 --> 09:19.967
Do you wanna fish for a while?

09:20.903 --> 09:22.303
No.

09:24.373 --> 09:25.740
Okay.

09:27.342 --> 09:29.377
Might be a nice trick to learn.

09:30.179 --> 09:32.081
Think I could figure it out.

09:32.082 --> 09:33.481
Oh you do?

09:35.551 --> 09:37.752
You know, it's not so easy Mickey.

09:38.187 --> 09:40.189
There's a subtlety to it.

09:40.190 --> 09:41.422
A finesse.

09:42.724 --> 09:44.392
Yeah, you're subtle.

09:44.393 --> 09:46.560
You're Mr. Finesse.

09:46.962 --> 09:50.431
You're about as subtle as
a fucking sledgehammer.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.534
Anyway, look.

09:52.535 --> 09:57.571
Fish, fish, fish, more fish.

10:01.043 --> 10:02.411
Point taken.

10:02.412 --> 10:04.478
Why don't you start a fire.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.446
What are they doing out here?

10:41.183 --> 10:43.317
You said they wouldn't
come in the woods.

10:43.318 --> 10:44.486
No, I never said that.

10:44.487 --> 10:47.288
<i>- Yes! You said that...
- What I said, Mickey...</i>

10:47.789 --> 10:50.458
was that there would be
less of them in the woods.

10:51.126 --> 10:54.628
Same as there will be
less of them on the moon.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.031
Relax.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.500
It's done.

11:01.004 --> 11:03.224
Why don't you go put some
coffee on or something?

11:47.182 --> 11:49.550
Oh my God!

11:49.885 --> 11:50.552
Stinks?

11:50.553 --> 11:52.253
Ugh!

11:52.921 --> 11:54.288
Oh!

13:24.079 --> 13:26.313
Hey Benny, look,
there's a sun roof.

13:27.482 --> 13:29.817
Yeah well it's a fucking
rain roof right now!

13:29.818 --> 13:33.187
Close the thing, Jesus Christ.

14:02.284 --> 14:05.853
Well, it's better than the
shit that used to be on.

14:05.854 --> 14:09.257
You remember that girl I was
seeing up in Pittsfield?

14:10.792 --> 14:13.427
Ummm, no...

18:03.358 --> 18:04.225
Hey.

18:06.528 --> 18:09.229
Check this out.

18:09.364 --> 18:10.531
Right?

18:10.532 --> 18:11.932
Look at this.

18:15.537 --> 18:17.437
It's huge!

18:17.539 --> 18:20.407
We could lay some pillows
down, blankets...

18:20.542 --> 18:22.943
it's like a bachelor pad.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.912
Sure.

18:25.547 --> 18:27.114
Alright, then.

18:27.816 --> 18:31.184
Let's go steal some of your
dead girlfriend's blankets.

18:46.601 --> 18:48.669
I know what you're thinking Mickey.

18:49.571 --> 18:52.873
And the answer is no fucking way.

18:53.074 --> 18:54.441
What?

18:55.577 --> 18:57.444
You wanna stay.

19:00.415 --> 19:02.316
Just for a little while.

19:02.617 --> 19:03.984
No fuckin' way.

19:04.419 --> 19:05.852
Why not?

19:06.588 --> 19:08.822
Do I really have to
answer that question?

19:09.658 --> 19:12.793
But we just go and go, man.
Where are we going?

19:12.994 --> 19:15.295
We're not goin' anywhere.

19:15.597 --> 19:17.598
Mickey, that's the point.

19:17.599 --> 19:19.700
We're like sharks.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.871
Sharks are the ultimate
survivor, Mickey.

19:22.872 --> 19:25.106
They've been around four
hundred million fucking years,

19:25.107 --> 19:26.306
you know why?

19:26.775 --> 19:28.510
'Cause they keep moving.

19:28.511 --> 19:31.211
They stop, they die,
it's the same as us.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.313
It's not the same.

19:32.314 --> 19:36.351
That was a house, up in Pittsfield,
that we were stuck in.

19:36.352 --> 19:37.786
For three fuckin' months,

19:37.787 --> 19:39.154
- Remember?
- I remember.

19:39.155 --> 19:40.789
Your mother, your brother

19:40.790 --> 19:42.023
- They were in a house.
- I know.

19:42.024 --> 19:43.958
We ate dog food.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.460
- I know, Benny!
- And then we ate the dog!

19:45.461 --> 19:46.995
We ate the fuckin' dog, Mickey!

19:46.996 --> 19:48.963
I had to kill the dog so
we could eat the dog.

19:48.964 --> 19:51.065
I'm not gonna have this discussion.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.834
I'm not gonna trap myself

19:52.835 --> 19:54.903
in a big dumb-ass stupid
fuckin' house again!

19:54.904 --> 19:57.070
No thank you.

19:57.672 --> 20:00.508
No we came, we checked it
out, you're girl's not here.

20:00.509 --> 20:02.342
I'm sorry about that.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.912
But we got some cool shit!

20:03.913 --> 20:05.714
And as of now we're not
completely surrounded

20:05.715 --> 20:06.981
by fucking monsters.

20:06.982 --> 20:09.349
So I don't think we
should press our luck.

20:12.253 --> 20:12.921
Can't we just stay...

20:12.922 --> 20:15.455
Ahhhhhhhhh!

20:15.590 --> 20:17.357
Ahhh!

20:36.745 --> 20:37.778
Mickey.

20:40.849 --> 20:42.249
Mickey.

20:46.588 --> 20:47.621
Hey.

20:48.389 --> 20:49.423
What?

20:50.125 --> 20:51.425
Pile's hot.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.567
Mickey!

22:41.202 --> 22:43.069
Wanna throw me some?

22:43.972 --> 22:45.405
Mick?

23:02.658 --> 23:06.361
Jesus! What the fuck, man?!
Don't do that shit!

23:06.362 --> 23:09.062
Those things are gonna
get you killed, man.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.165
And maybe me too.
Turn 'em down, will ya?

23:11.166 --> 23:12.233
- Alright.
- I'm serious

23:12.234 --> 23:14.034
I heard you, alright.

23:14.035 --> 23:15.035
Okay.

23:15.503 --> 23:17.737
Now...

23:18.273 --> 23:19.940
- Here.
- Come pitch me some...

23:19.941 --> 23:21.575
Check this out.

23:24.113 --> 23:25.979
Come on, get out there.

23:29.050 --> 23:30.483
<i>Testing, testing,</i>

23:31.753 --> 23:33.888
What do you think the
range is on these things?

23:33.889 --> 23:37.591
I don't know, five,
ten miles maybe.

23:37.725 --> 23:38.960
Well, they work.

23:38.961 --> 23:40.861
They do work.

23:40.862 --> 23:42.796
Alright, you can come back in.

23:42.797 --> 23:45.165
Nah, actually I think I'm
gonna go take a shit.

23:48.236 --> 23:50.972
<i>Annie, this is Orchard.</i>

23:50.973 --> 23:52.806
<i>Come back.</i>

23:52.941 --> 23:55.442
<i>This is Annie, go head.</i>

23:55.710 --> 23:58.646
Yeah, listen. I got an addition
<i>to your shopping list here,</i>

23:58.647 --> 24:01.014
<i>courtesy of Miss Carter.</i>

24:01.449 --> 24:02.884
<i>Go head.</i>

24:02.885 --> 24:05.453
<i>Well, apparently
she told Jason uh,</i>

24:05.454 --> 24:07.255
<i>he could pick the movie this week,</i>

24:07.256 --> 24:09.590
<i>on account of the birthday thing.</i>

24:09.591 --> 24:10.892
What do we do?

24:10.893 --> 24:13.828
<i>She told him,
"Any movie you want."</i>

24:13.829 --> 24:15.929
<i>What'd he pick?</i>

24:16.064 --> 24:17.697
<i>"Tremors"</i>

24:17.832 --> 24:19.432
<i>Say again?</i>

24:19.734 --> 24:21.169
<i>"Tremors"</i>

24:21.170 --> 24:24.704
It's the giant killer worm movie
<i>with uh... Kevin Bacon.</i>

24:25.173 --> 24:28.041
<i>I'm familiar with "Tremors" over.</i>

24:28.242 --> 24:30.511
<i>Well, she promised the
kid we'd find it.</i>

24:30.512 --> 24:32.513
Been on my ass all day about it,

24:32.514 --> 24:34.816
<i>like I got time for this shit.</i>

24:34.817 --> 24:37.118
<i>What kind of a goddammed movie
is that to pick anyway?</i>

24:37.119 --> 24:38.818
<i>Over.</i>

24:38.953 --> 24:41.488
<i>Well if they got it,
I'll get it, Frank.</i>

24:41.689 --> 24:44.092
<i>Yeah, well don't bust
your ass over it.</i>

24:44.093 --> 24:46.293
<i>We got more pressing concerns.</i>

24:47.929 --> 24:49.229
Go head, man.

24:52.266 --> 24:53.633
Hello?

24:53.968 --> 24:55.468
Hello, over.

24:58.439 --> 25:00.108
Annie.

25:00.109 --> 25:01.241
Frank?

25:01.509 --> 25:03.209
The Orchard.

25:03.945 --> 25:06.179
Anyone, over.

25:07.783 --> 25:09.549
Who is this?

25:09.884 --> 25:11.552
Uh, hi. This is uh, Mickey.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.055
<i>I'm here with Ben.</i>
<i>Benjamin McBride. We're...</i>

25:14.056 --> 25:15.456
We're uh, ballplayers.

25:15.457 --> 25:17.892
We were playing baseball
up in Pittsfield, when...

25:17.893 --> 25:19.059
Well...

25:19.861 --> 25:22.130
Anyway, we've been
walking forever, and...

25:22.131 --> 25:23.898
We just found a car.

25:23.899 --> 25:26.333
We're in Connecticut. Over.

25:29.238 --> 25:31.973
<i>You stay off this channel.</i>

25:31.974 --> 25:33.074
What?

25:33.075 --> 25:34.075
Wait.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.942
Wait, what? Hello.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.078
Please, we're...

25:37.079 --> 25:39.579
we'e just looking for
a place to stay.

25:40.081 --> 25:41.983
We're really hard workers.
We can...

25:41.984 --> 25:43.917
fish, and cook...

25:43.985 --> 25:46.720
and I think that we could
help each other out, over.

25:47.155 --> 25:49.023
<i>We got hard workers, kid.</i>

25:49.024 --> 25:50.425
<i>What we ain't got is room.</i>

25:50.426 --> 25:52.593
<i>We got no vacancy.</i>

25:52.594 --> 25:54.027
<i>You understand?</i>

25:54.028 --> 25:55.096
<i>Now that's that.</i>

25:55.097 --> 25:56.597
<i>And don't try to find us.</i>

25:56.598 --> 25:58.898
<i>You're not welcome.</i>

25:58.933 --> 26:00.567
<i>Annie, come back.</i>

26:00.568 --> 26:02.169
<i>Go head.</i>

26:02.170 --> 26:03.905
<i>I don't want you
talking to these kids,</i>

26:03.906 --> 26:04.705
<i>you understand?</i>

26:04.706 --> 26:06.074
You know the rules.

26:06.075 --> 26:09.076
Just stay off the waves and
get back in, you copy?

26:09.077 --> 26:11.111
<i>10-4 and out.</i>

26:11.112 --> 26:13.113
No. No, no, no, no. Hello!

26:13.114 --> 26:14.415
Hello, please!

26:14.416 --> 26:15.915
Please!

26:17.185 --> 26:18.752
We're gonna die out here.

26:19.053 --> 26:20.387
Hello.

26:21.089 --> 26:22.288
Annie.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.924
Annie, please.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.327
Hello?

26:32.233 --> 26:34.167
You believe that?

26:35.236 --> 26:36.803
I don't know.

26:37.872 --> 26:39.339
What do we do?

26:40.308 --> 26:41.975
I don't know.

26:42.043 --> 26:43.610
You don't know?

26:43.644 --> 26:44.979
You don't know?

26:44.980 --> 26:46.746
What don't you know?

26:46.948 --> 26:48.082
I know.

26:48.083 --> 26:51.219
You know, I know that these
are the first people

26:51.220 --> 26:52.653
that we've heard from in months.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.454
Months!!

26:54.655 --> 26:56.590
They've got their
shit together, man.

26:56.591 --> 26:57.758
Communications...

26:57.759 --> 26:58.793
birthdays...

26:58.794 --> 27:00.128
fucking movies!

27:00.129 --> 27:01.729
Fucking "Tremors"!!!

27:01.730 --> 27:04.398
Yeah, and we're clearly not
invited to the party, Mick.

27:04.399 --> 27:06.499
I don't care.

27:06.767 --> 27:09.469
I don't wanna live out here
like this anymore, man.

27:09.470 --> 27:11.239
Sleeping on rooftops.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.940
Living out of a car.

27:12.941 --> 27:14.174
With you.

27:14.175 --> 27:15.977
You're like a fucking caveman.

27:15.978 --> 27:17.478
And you stink.

27:17.479 --> 27:19.446
And you don't seem to care.

27:19.447 --> 27:21.182
You know, you like living this

27:21.183 --> 27:24.252
hunter-gather
lifestyle, but I don't!

27:24.253 --> 27:26.854
You know, I don't like waking
up every day wondering if

27:26.855 --> 27:28.855
today's the day I'm gonna die.

27:28.923 --> 27:32.260
Wondering if today's the day that a
fucking walking dead person eats my head!

27:33.262 --> 27:34.462
It's not funny man!

27:34.463 --> 27:35.863
- No it's not funny
- It's not fucking funny!

27:35.864 --> 27:37.198
- It's the way you said...
- I'm serious!

27:37.199 --> 27:39.300
Okay, I know, okay, you're
fucking serious, man.

27:39.301 --> 27:40.867
I get it.

27:41.102 --> 27:42.703
You wanna find 'em, go find 'em.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.505
They don't wanna be found, man.

27:44.506 --> 27:46.206
How you gonna find 'em?

27:52.713 --> 27:56.316
Annie, come back, over.

27:56.317 --> 27:58.585
They're not gonna
answer you, Mickey.

27:59.153 --> 28:01.221
It's been days, man.

28:02.223 --> 28:05.692
That shit was just a
whisper in the wind.

28:11.532 --> 28:12.732
Annie.

28:13.234 --> 28:14.868
Come back, please.

28:15.703 --> 28:17.238
Wait a minute, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait...

28:17.239 --> 28:18.438
What?

28:19.874 --> 28:22.342
You got a thing for her, don't ya?

28:22.977 --> 28:24.411
Annie!

28:24.412 --> 28:26.047
Oh my God!

28:26.048 --> 28:28.716
Oh my God! You're so
fucking funny, man.

28:28.717 --> 28:30.251
You're so weird!

28:30.252 --> 28:32.752
You're not asking for, for Frank.

28:33.054 --> 28:34.555
You're not asking for The Orchard.

28:34.556 --> 28:35.256
Shut up.

28:35.257 --> 28:36.657
Just... Annie.

28:36.658 --> 28:37.992
Annie, come back!

28:37.993 --> 28:39.393
Annie, please come back!

28:39.394 --> 28:40.394
Save me!

28:40.395 --> 28:42.228
- Shut up.
- Please, Annie!

28:42.263 --> 28:43.231
You know what?

28:43.232 --> 28:45.566
You wanna know the difference
between you and me?

28:45.567 --> 28:47.235
What, I'm not an asshole?

28:47.236 --> 28:48.102
It's that...

28:48.103 --> 28:49.904
we both know...

28:49.905 --> 28:51.938
that there's a girl
out there, right?

28:52.006 --> 28:53.540
Driving around...

28:53.674 --> 28:56.344
doing some highly
organized scavenging...

28:56.345 --> 28:57.878
some recon missions...

28:57.879 --> 29:00.948
who knows, it could be a couple
fuckin' weirdos on the radio but...

29:00.949 --> 29:03.384
let's say she's out there.

29:03.385 --> 29:06.186
She's probably coming from
someplace fortified...

29:06.187 --> 29:08.621
big walls, like you said.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.524
But these are logical
deductions, yes?

29:11.525 --> 29:13.127
- What's your point?
- Well...

29:13.128 --> 29:14.661
My point is...

29:14.795 --> 29:16.463
in your mind,

29:16.464 --> 29:21.000
she's like this
post-apocalyptic pixie girl.

29:21.035 --> 29:23.203
With like, a gun on her hip.

29:23.204 --> 29:24.371
And like, a garter.

29:24.372 --> 29:26.407
And maybe like, a scar

29:26.408 --> 29:29.243
that's so well placed that
it shows how tough she is

29:29.244 --> 29:31.511
but doesn't fuck up her
pretty face, right?

29:32.280 --> 29:33.980
And in my mind?

29:35.116 --> 29:38.451
She's like a 46-year-old
softball coach.

29:39.287 --> 29:40.787
With a mullet.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.924
And fuckin' calves
like canned hams, man.

29:45.293 --> 29:46.659
Right?

29:46.794 --> 29:49.163
I mean, if they're gonna send a
woman, that's who they're gonna send.

29:49.164 --> 29:51.232
A trucker. A bull dyke.

29:51.233 --> 29:55.668
Not fuckin' Frank's
barely legal niece.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.173
But...

30:00.608 --> 30:02.642
you're a romantic.

30:03.277 --> 30:05.645
And I'm a realist, that's okay.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.148
Probably gonna get
you killed, though.

30:08.149 --> 30:10.283
Just like those fuckin' headphones.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.165
You know, you're the
only person I know

30:24.166 --> 30:27.467
that could walk all the way across
New England and gain weight.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.738
I'm the only person
you know, Mickey.

30:32.273 --> 30:33.840
Period.

30:36.110 --> 30:37.044
Plus...

30:37.045 --> 30:39.679
I'm a catcher,
I'm allowed to be fat.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.449
<i>Well then you pull it off.</i>

30:41.450 --> 30:43.017
Fuck you, sir.

30:43.018 --> 30:44.984
Fuck you to death.

30:55.463 --> 30:57.398
I think you're over
thinking this one, Mickey.

30:57.399 --> 30:59.199
- Yeah?
- Yep.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.534
I think you're
grasping a little bit.

31:02.403 --> 31:04.871
Who says that? "No Vacancy"?

31:05.206 --> 31:06.874
Uh, people say it man.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.741
It's a saying, it means...

31:08.809 --> 31:10.978
No room, no space, don't uh...

31:10.979 --> 31:12.246
don't come here.

31:12.247 --> 31:14.514
We cannot accommodate you.

31:14.515 --> 31:16.650
- Please don't come to...
- Oh shit!

31:16.651 --> 31:18.486
God dammit.

31:18.487 --> 31:20.955
I told you this was gonna happen.

31:22.257 --> 31:24.692
Get in the car. Get
in the god damn car.

31:24.693 --> 31:26.160
Can we go now, are we done?

31:26.161 --> 31:27.828
Can we cross this
place off the list?

31:27.829 --> 31:29.764
You know, I don't know why
you feel like you have to

31:29.765 --> 31:31.532
kill every fucking one of them.

31:31.533 --> 31:34.568
Because I do! Because
we do, it's our duty.

31:34.569 --> 31:35.770
No you don't!

31:35.771 --> 31:38.873
You're gonna get yourself killed because
you have to confront every single one.

31:38.874 --> 31:40.707
Pay attention! Watch out!

31:41.375 --> 31:43.778
If you'll just stop
fucking distracting me

31:43.779 --> 31:44.945
while I'm trying to do this!

31:44.946 --> 31:47.213
Just do it and get back in the car!

31:47.214 --> 31:49.083
You know, why don't you
get out here and do it?

31:49.084 --> 31:50.684
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:50.685 --> 31:51.552
- Are we gonna do this again?
- Yeah, no, I think it's time.

31:51.553 --> 31:52.686
Get out here and fucking do it.

31:52.687 --> 31:54.121
I mean, aren't you just
a little bit angry?

31:54.122 --> 31:55.623
Aren't you just a little
bit angry, Mickey?

31:55.624 --> 31:56.857
Shut up.

31:56.858 --> 31:58.692
This one over here?
She killed your brother.

31:58.693 --> 32:01.262
- Fuck you.
- This motherfucker here?

32:01.263 --> 32:02.463
- He ate your mom!

32:02.464 --> 32:04.524
- You're an asshole!
- He ate her right up!!!

32:12.473 --> 32:14.408
You're gonna have to
do it sometime, man.

32:14.409 --> 32:15.675
Yeah.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.810
But I don't have to do it today.

32:17.978 --> 32:20.780
And neither do you.

32:25.453 --> 32:26.420
Fuck you!

32:26.421 --> 32:27.820
Fuck you!

32:27.922 --> 32:29.089
Fuck!

32:29.090 --> 32:31.524
Fuck!

32:36.497 --> 32:37.932
Here hold this for me, will ya?

32:37.933 --> 32:39.567
Get that outta my fucking face.

32:53.147 --> 32:54.313
<i>Ah!</i>

32:54.515 --> 32:56.616
Aya whoohooo!

32:56.617 --> 32:58.284
Whoooo!

32:58.452 --> 32:59.752
Wooo!

32:59.753 --> 33:01.088
Ah ha haaa!

33:01.089 --> 33:02.722
Ahhh!

33:03.691 --> 33:06.359
Haaaa! ho hoooo

33:06.760 --> 33:08.661
Haaaaaa!

33:08.662 --> 33:10.062
Ha!

33:10.631 --> 33:12.231
Ohhh!

33:13.133 --> 33:15.168
Hahahahahah!

33:40.327 --> 33:41.328
Ah!

33:41.329 --> 33:42.730
No! No, no, no!

33:42.731 --> 33:43.497
No, no, no, no!!

33:43.498 --> 33:44.865
Ah, shit!!

33:44.866 --> 33:45.733
Ah, sh-shit!

33:45.734 --> 33:47.201
Shut up!!

33:47.202 --> 33:48.335
Oh, God!

33:48.336 --> 33:49.702
Ben!!

33:52.740 --> 33:53.940
Oh!

35:38.612 --> 35:40.446
The fuck!?

35:40.614 --> 35:43.417
Oh my fucking...

35:47.955 --> 35:49.423
I'm sorry, Mickey!

35:49.424 --> 35:50.524
I'm sorry, man!

35:50.525 --> 35:53.627
Oh shit, are you finished?

35:53.628 --> 35:55.496
I can't even fucking,
I can't breathe!

35:55.497 --> 35:57.498
I can't breathe!

35:57.499 --> 36:02.201
Fuck, I gotta go.

36:02.202 --> 36:04.503
I'll come back, you finish up!

36:04.538 --> 36:06.339
Aw, Jesus!

39:21.001 --> 39:23.002
We're fucking staying the night.

39:23.837 --> 39:24.937
Okay?

39:26.139 --> 39:27.574
We're in the middle of nowhere!

39:27.575 --> 39:29.843
There's nothing around for
miles and the only reason

39:29.844 --> 39:32.212
we got stuck in that
house in Massachusetts,

39:32.213 --> 39:35.014
is because we didn't know
what the fuck was going on!

39:35.048 --> 39:36.850
I want to sleep in a house.

39:36.851 --> 39:38.085
In a bed!

39:38.086 --> 39:40.085
Like a real human.

39:40.654 --> 39:43.088
So we're fucking staying the night!

39:46.860 --> 39:48.961
Okay.

39:50.697 --> 39:52.464
Guess we're staying the night.

40:26.801 --> 40:28.968
Hey Ben? Have you seen my...

40:31.405 --> 40:32.671
What's up?

40:32.906 --> 40:34.139
What are you doing?

40:34.207 --> 40:36.442
I'm trying to put this...

40:36.743 --> 40:37.911
fucking bow together.

40:37.912 --> 40:39.912
I can see that.

40:39.913 --> 40:41.981
So you wanna borrow those...?

40:42.149 --> 40:43.717
Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, these?

40:43.718 --> 40:46.085
- You can have 'em back tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

40:46.086 --> 40:48.488
Yeah. I'll give them
back when we leave.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.790
You'll give them back?

40:49.791 --> 40:51.590
They're my headphones.

40:52.492 --> 40:55.628
You're the one who wants
to stay the night.

40:55.629 --> 40:57.463
So that's what this is about?

40:57.798 --> 40:59.465
Yeah, it is.

40:59.733 --> 41:01.601
You wanna have a
fuckin' sleepover...

41:01.602 --> 41:04.104
in a big box with no wheels.

41:04.105 --> 41:06.805
And I don't want you
to be distracted.

41:07.407 --> 41:11.477
I want you to be able to hear a fucking
squirrel take a shit out there.

41:11.578 --> 41:14.253
That's the only way I'm gonna feel
remotely safe sleeping in this house.

41:16.350 --> 41:17.683
What?

41:18.018 --> 41:20.152
You think I don't like music?

41:21.621 --> 41:23.789
I fuckin' love music, man.

41:24.658 --> 41:26.460
But I always have to
be present and aware,

41:26.461 --> 41:28.527
because you don't
wanna deal with shit.

41:28.795 --> 41:31.164
You're always hiding in
these things, Mickey.

41:31.165 --> 41:32.599
You're burning through batteries,

41:32.600 --> 41:35.202
you're blowing out your eardrums,
and you're putting my life at risk.

41:35.203 --> 41:36.970
How am I putting your life at risk?

41:36.971 --> 41:39.371
Because we're a fucking team, man!

41:39.639 --> 41:40.974
A battery!

41:40.975 --> 41:42.708
Remember?

41:42.809 --> 41:44.144
Whether you like it or not

41:44.145 --> 41:45.979
and you know what,
maybe I'm just tired of

41:45.980 --> 41:49.148
watching both of our fucking
backs all the time.

41:50.851 --> 41:52.686
It's for your own good man.

41:52.687 --> 41:54.821
You need to wake up and realize

41:54.822 --> 41:57.222
that this is how it
is out here now.

42:01.228 --> 42:04.063
Nobody's gonna flip
this switch back on.

42:04.664 --> 42:06.033
Flip the switch back on?

42:06.034 --> 42:07.801
What's that, I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

42:07.802 --> 42:09.369
Can't hear you through
the beautiful...

42:09.370 --> 42:10.769
music.

42:10.837 --> 42:12.338
It's so loud.

42:12.506 --> 42:14.540
It's so loud and glorious.

42:21.381 --> 42:23.515
I'm gonna fucking shoot you.

42:36.063 --> 42:38.097
Did you see that?

42:54.915 --> 42:56.281
Hey Mick!

42:56.716 --> 42:59.485
Come and look at this
fuckin' mural, man.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.588
It's insane.

43:03.056 --> 43:05.324
There's like a beautiful woman.

43:06.793 --> 43:08.061
Perky little titties.

43:08.062 --> 43:10.396
Long legs.

43:12.566 --> 43:13.800
She's sitting in the
middle of the woods.

43:13.801 --> 43:16.935
Surrounded by a bunch
of animals. There's like...

43:17.070 --> 43:20.540
a gazelle, a fucking red fox.

43:20.541 --> 43:25.879
A huge stork. Some
kind of bird of prey.

43:25.880 --> 43:27.913
And she's like, leaning on a lion.

43:29.382 --> 43:30.884
It looks like... You
know what it looks like?

43:30.885 --> 43:34.587
It looks like one of those...
Jehovah's Witness pamphlets.

43:34.588 --> 43:36.957
You know, where all
of God's creatures...

43:36.958 --> 43:38.592
are united and peaceful

43:38.593 --> 43:40.959
in the Kingdom on
Heaven or some shit.

43:44.097 --> 43:46.165
Come here. Come look at it.

43:48.768 --> 43:51.270
What? No? Okay.

43:55.575 --> 43:57.876
I want to go there.

44:32.512 --> 44:35.681
Annie, you... you there?

44:38.018 --> 44:39.751
Anyone?

44:43.156 --> 44:46.191
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

45:01.976 --> 45:03.143
<i>They'd put me over the fence</i>

45:03.144 --> 45:05.511
<i>if they knew I was talking to you.</i>

45:09.482 --> 45:11.016
Hello?

45:13.153 --> 45:15.055
<i>You've gotta let this go.</i>

45:15.056 --> 45:16.788
<i>You understand?</i>

45:16.890 --> 45:18.123
<i>Please.</i>

45:20.227 --> 45:23.595
I can't <i>This place...</i>

45:23.897 --> 45:26.398
<i>it's not what you think it is.</i>

45:30.036 --> 45:31.737
What is it?

45:32.272 --> 45:33.773
<i>That's exactly the sort of thing</i>

45:33.774 --> 45:36.742
<i>they'd put me over the
fence for saying.</i>

45:39.112 --> 45:42.814
I bet it's not...
sleeping on a roof.

45:42.916 --> 45:44.950
Or a tree.

45:46.052 --> 45:47.419
Or in a car.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.489
Like a rat in a cage. Is it?

45:51.858 --> 45:54.326
<i>No, it isn't.</i>

45:56.263 --> 45:59.064
Then don't tell me to let it go.

45:59.065 --> 46:01.400
I don't have anything else.

46:02.269 --> 46:04.903
<i>What about your friend?</i>

46:10.110 --> 46:11.443
Ben?

46:12.812 --> 46:14.680
Ben... I...

46:16.650 --> 46:18.917
We were ballplayers, I...

46:19.452 --> 46:21.687
He was the starting catcher.

46:22.088 --> 46:24.256
I was out in the bullpen.

46:24.424 --> 46:27.926
We never hung out in
the same circles.

46:31.131 --> 46:33.632
I hardly even know him.

46:35.669 --> 46:37.804
<i>Listen, I didn't push this button</i>

46:37.805 --> 46:39.239
<i>to gab like schoolgirls.</i>

46:39.240 --> 46:43.008
For your own good, change the
fucking channel, Mickey.

Shut up. Shut up, shut up.

49:42.923 --> 49:44.222
Shut up!

49:49.128 --> 49:51.663
Mickey wake up!!

49:52.432 --> 49:54.033
<i>What the fuck!?!!</i>

49:54.034 --> 49:55.635
Come on, Mick!

49:55.636 --> 49:57.002
Come on, Mick!

49:57.303 --> 49:59.339
<i>- You gotta do it!
- What are you doing?!</i>

49:59.340 --> 50:01.107
<i>- Come on, Mickey!</i>
<i>- Let me out!!!</i>

50:01.108 --> 50:03.710
I left the bat in there!
I've seen you swing it!

50:03.711 --> 50:05.710
Swing the fucking bat, Mickey!

50:05.879 --> 50:07.981
<i>- Nooooo! No!</i>
<i>- Come on, Mick!</i>

50:07.982 --> 50:10.116
<i>- Noo!</i>
<i>- Mickey!</i>

50:10.117 --> 50:13.186
<i>God! Please!</i>

50:13.187 --> 50:16.356
<i>- Come on man!
- Stop! Get off! Get off!</i>

50:16.357 --> 50:18.491
Mickey!!!

50:22.362 --> 50:23.596
Man?

50:25.299 --> 50:27.000
Mickey?

50:38.378 --> 50:39.912
Well?

50:39.913 --> 50:43.548
You made a fucking mess,
but you got the job done.

50:47.587 --> 50:50.856
What the fuck, Mickey!
What the fuck are you...?

50:51.491 --> 50:52.559
Get off me!

50:52.560 --> 50:54.726
What the fuck!

50:55.161 --> 50:56.896
You motherfuck...

50:56.897 --> 50:58.964
Get off me!

51:04.203 --> 51:05.704
Fucker.

51:09.375 --> 51:11.411
Oh, fuck!

51:11.412 --> 51:14.279
Aw, Mickey. Mickey!

51:14.380 --> 51:16.648
Come back, man.

51:17.417 --> 51:20.385
You're on the board, Mick!

51:20.553 --> 51:23.288
We gotta celebrate!

51:35.568 --> 51:37.168
Mickey!

51:43.476 --> 51:45.110
Mickey!

51:47.246 --> 51:49.649
Where you goin', Mick?

51:55.755 --> 51:57.422
Mickey.

51:59.592 --> 52:01.326
What are you doin'?

52:05.565 --> 52:07.666
I talked to her.

52:08.001 --> 52:09.167
Who?

52:09.168 --> 52:10.869
Annie?

52:13.574 --> 52:16.808
She said they'd kick her
out if she talked to me.

52:17.477 --> 52:20.278
She told me to let it go.

52:23.316 --> 52:25.817
Aw shit man.

52:30.490 --> 52:32.825
You know, you look like a
fuckin' lunatic right now.

52:32.826 --> 52:34.659
Why don't you uh...

52:35.528 --> 52:37.295
come get cleaned up.

52:38.264 --> 52:39.798
Get some clothes on.

52:39.799 --> 52:42.033
Get outta this fucking rain.

52:45.505 --> 52:46.838
Come on.

53:08.728 --> 53:10.929
Cheer up, Mickey.

53:14.567 --> 53:16.001
Mickey.

53:16.169 --> 53:17.336
Cheer up!

53:17.337 --> 53:19.838
It was just a girl on the radio.

53:19.872 --> 53:21.841
There's other girls
out there, brother.

53:21.842 --> 53:23.608
Somewhere.

53:24.043 --> 53:25.844
We'll find you a nice one.

53:28.314 --> 53:32.083
This is the saddest game
of catch I've ever had.

53:32.385 --> 53:33.653
Do you want me to do a...

53:33.654 --> 53:36.454
Do you want me to do a dance?
A funky dance?

53:37.090 --> 53:39.092
Doo-dat-dooo-dat-doo

53:39.093 --> 53:40.993
doo-dee-doo-dee-doo

53:40.994 --> 53:43.096
dooodle-doo-dat-doo!

53:43.097 --> 53:45.264
Cheer up, Mickey!

53:45.265 --> 53:46.599
Alright, let's get you an assist.

53:46.600 --> 53:47.567
You want an assist?

53:47.568 --> 53:50.002
Here we go. He's gonna
come around second.

53:50.003 --> 53:51.571
He's gonna head for home.

53:51.572 --> 53:53.605
You're gonna throw him out,
alright? I want a rope.

53:53.606 --> 53:54.807
Come on, Mick.

53:55.542 --> 53:56.709
He's comin' around!

53:56.710 --> 53:58.977
Comin' around third!
Get it in, get it in!

53:59.345 --> 54:00.879
Whoooo!

54:01.280 --> 54:03.381
He's out!!

57:24.216 --> 57:25.583
Ben.

57:26.052 --> 57:27.252
What?

57:27.920 --> 57:30.056
It's hot.

57:30.057 --> 57:32.957
I think there's someone here.

57:40.499 --> 57:42.333
Hello!

57:44.971 --> 57:47.138
Anybody there?

57:51.010 --> 57:52.344
Just keep an eye out.

57:52.345 --> 57:55.013
We'll be gone in a second.

58:00.953 --> 58:02.053
Ben.

58:03.122 --> 58:03.823
- It's fucking...
- Benny!

58:03.824 --> 58:05.091
Bone dry!

58:05.092 --> 58:06.826
There's not a dr... hey!
Whoa, what the fuck!?

58:06.827 --> 58:09.160
Stop right there.

58:09.362 --> 58:11.796
<i>Just gimme the keys,
and I'll let him go.</i>

58:11.797 --> 58:13.766
Just calm down, okay?

58:13.767 --> 58:15.201
<i>Gimme the fucking keys!</i>

58:15.202 --> 58:17.203
Can we talk about this? Let's talk.

58:17.204 --> 58:19.171
I don't have time to fucking talk.

58:19.172 --> 58:21.173
Why not, what's the rush, man?
Where you going?

58:21.174 --> 58:22.475
Please, we can help you.

58:22.476 --> 58:24.842
We can take you anywhere you want.

58:24.844 --> 58:27.278
Yeah, I need to go
to fucking Arizona.

58:27.279 --> 58:29.981
Are you gonna take me
to fucking Arizona?!

58:30.049 --> 58:31.817
No, I didn't think so.

58:31.818 --> 58:36.154
Now put down the gun,
and toss over the keys.

58:36.655 --> 58:38.189
I don't have the keys.

58:38.991 --> 58:41.027
God dammit I am not
fucking around here!

58:41.028 --> 58:44.095
I will open this motherfucker up!

58:44.797 --> 58:46.731
No you won't.

58:46.866 --> 58:49.000
What did you say?

58:49.235 --> 58:51.569
I said you won't do it.

58:51.971 --> 58:54.339
Then you have no leverage.

58:54.840 --> 58:57.710
If they find me I'm
a dead man anyway.

58:57.711 --> 58:59.210
Who?

58:59.211 --> 59:00.379
Who finds you?

59:00.380 --> 59:02.014
I'm done talking to you, asshole.

59:02.015 --> 59:03.983
Hey tell me, what's
in Arizona, huh?

59:03.984 --> 59:06.084
You got three seconds.

59:06.085 --> 59:07.153
What do you got, a wife?

59:07.154 --> 59:09.021
Shut your fucking mouth!

59:09.022 --> 59:10.588
Couple of kids?

59:10.656 --> 59:11.856
Tell me.

59:12.892 --> 59:14.226
Are they gonna be happy
about the way you got home?

59:14.227 --> 59:16.494
Stealing from innocent people?

59:16.495 --> 59:19.031
Don't you think we got
enough to worry about?

59:19.032 --> 59:22.300
Without having to worry
about each other?

59:23.202 --> 59:25.570
Tell me your name, man.
What's your name?

59:26.038 --> 59:28.773
Jerry, my name's Jerry.

59:29.875 --> 59:31.209
Jerry.

59:31.510 --> 59:33.112
My name's Ben.

59:33.113 --> 59:34.880
- That's Mickey.
- Stop trying to talk me down!

59:34.881 --> 59:37.615
- Sir please!
- Shut up!

59:38.751 --> 59:40.885
They told me they
were gonna take me.

59:40.886 --> 59:42.555
They said if I stuck it out,

59:42.556 --> 59:44.090
and worked through
the winter they'd...

59:44.091 --> 59:45.858
come spring they'd give me a truck.

59:45.859 --> 59:48.493
And a gun, and enough food
and gas to make it home.

59:48.727 --> 59:50.463
But they fucking lied!

59:50.464 --> 59:52.330
Who, who lied?

59:52.431 --> 59:54.298
If you don't put down that gun...

59:54.300 --> 59:57.101
and give me the keys to that car...

59:58.237 --> 01:00:00.705
I will take his fucking eye.

01:00:00.706 --> 01:00:02.241
<i>No Ben! Benny!</i>

01:00:02.242 --> 01:00:02.908
Please!

01:00:02.909 --> 01:00:05.276
Give him the fucking keys!

01:00:05.778 --> 01:00:07.678
How's that for leverage?

01:00:08.314 --> 01:00:11.149
I told you, Jerry.

01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:13.484
I don't have the keys.

01:00:13.586 --> 01:00:15.853
They're in the car!

01:00:15.955 --> 01:00:18.756
They're in the car.
In the ignition.

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:19.957
Okay?

01:00:20.793 --> 01:00:22.193
Okay.

01:00:26.499 --> 01:00:29.100
You know, if it was
my kid, Jerry...

01:00:29.101 --> 01:00:31.604
I would have walked across this
whole fucking country by now.

01:00:31.605 --> 01:00:32.805
Fuck you!

01:00:32.806 --> 01:00:34.773
You don't know me, motherfucker!

01:00:34.774 --> 01:00:36.474
Open the door.

01:00:37.009 --> 01:00:38.709
Okay okay! Okay, Jerry?

01:00:38.811 --> 01:00:40.211
You win, Jerry.

01:00:40.613 --> 01:00:42.146
You win.

01:00:43.482 --> 01:00:45.283
Here's what's going to happen.

01:00:45.484 --> 01:00:47.885
I'm gonna throw the gun away.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.354
You're gonna let Mickey go.

01:00:50.756 --> 01:00:53.291
And you get in and
drive away, okay?

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.127
Okay.

01:00:55.128 --> 01:00:55.995
Give me the gun.

01:00:55.996 --> 01:00:58.964
No I'm not gonna give you the gun.
This is not a negotiation.

01:00:58.965 --> 01:01:01.200
Alright, I'd rather shoot you
both and take everything.

01:01:01.201 --> 01:01:03.502
You're not taking the
car and the gun.

01:01:03.503 --> 01:01:06.304
I am gonna throw the gun away,

01:01:06.839 --> 01:01:09.474
you're gonna let Mickey go,

01:01:09.775 --> 01:01:11.676
and be on your way.

01:01:14.346 --> 01:01:16.147
Okay.

01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:17.783
Throw it away.

01:01:17.784 --> 01:01:19.150
Okay.

01:01:24.123 --> 01:01:26.090
Let him go, Jerry.

01:01:35.035 --> 01:01:37.203
You fucking motherfucker!

01:01:37.204 --> 01:01:38.769
Fucker!

01:02:21.614 --> 01:02:23.249
That was a person, Benny.

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.949
Yeah it was.

01:02:25.251 --> 01:02:27.219
A real asshole, too.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.054
He just wanted to see his family.

01:02:29.055 --> 01:02:30.588
Yeah.

01:02:30.889 --> 01:02:33.091
I wanna see my family too, Mickey.

01:02:33.092 --> 01:02:35.261
But A: they're far away.

01:02:35.262 --> 01:02:38.396
And B: they're
probably fucking dead.

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:42.067
And I'm not gonna take someone
else's livelihood to do it.

01:02:42.068 --> 01:02:44.069
I mean, I don't
understand you, man.

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.138
That guy had a fucking
knife to your throat.

01:02:46.139 --> 01:02:48.107
I don't understand people
anymore, I tell ya I'm...

01:02:48.108 --> 01:02:49.275
starting to prefer the dead ones.

01:02:49.276 --> 01:02:50.109
Ben!

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:51.377
Look!

01:02:54.613 --> 01:02:56.681
Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:57.883 --> 01:02:59.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:12.264 --> 01:03:14.932
<i>We friends or what?</i>

01:03:15.734 --> 01:03:17.770
I don't know, are we?

01:03:17.771 --> 01:03:19.638
Well that's our car right there.

01:03:19.639 --> 01:03:22.640
We come to get it and be on our
way, that alright with you?

01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:25.311
Well it's got no gas in it.

01:03:25.312 --> 01:03:26.844
We got gas.

01:03:27.313 --> 01:03:27.946
So...

01:03:27.947 --> 01:03:28.947
we friends?

01:03:28.948 --> 01:03:30.615
Or what?

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:32.950
I guess so.

01:03:33.319 --> 01:03:35.019
Great.

01:03:48.934 --> 01:03:50.735
Thought you said we were friends.

01:03:51.136 --> 01:03:53.170
What about the shadow back there?

01:03:53.172 --> 01:03:54.972
Oh that's Egghead.

01:03:55.341 --> 01:03:56.975
Not because he's smart, either.

01:03:56.976 --> 01:03:59.178
Because he's got a big
ol' egg for a head.

01:03:59.179 --> 01:04:01.746
Put it away Eggs, get the can.

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:05.818
Who are you guys?

01:04:05.819 --> 01:04:08.753
Survivors, same as you.

01:04:08.787 --> 01:04:11.956
You uh, happened to see the
guy who was driving this?

01:04:11.957 --> 01:04:13.858
Yeah, we saw him.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.093
Where'd he go?

01:04:16.729 --> 01:04:18.429
He was bit.

01:04:19.031 --> 01:04:22.667
I had to finish him off, he's
in the field right there.

01:04:22.835 --> 01:04:26.203
He uh, say anything to you before?

01:04:26.538 --> 01:04:28.339
Bout what?

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:30.007
Anything?

01:04:31.176 --> 01:04:33.212
No, uh... just...

01:04:33.213 --> 01:04:36.781
panicky, yammering on
about family back West.

01:04:37.216 --> 01:04:39.385
He say where he got the car?

01:04:39.386 --> 01:04:40.718
No.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.354
Only that it was owed to him.

01:04:43.355 --> 01:04:46.357
And that you were probably
gonna come and get it.

01:04:46.725 --> 01:04:48.192
Half true.

01:04:48.394 --> 01:04:50.795
He tried to take ours, too.

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:53.265
Well he was a thief.

01:04:53.266 --> 01:04:55.200
Weird dude, you did
the right thing.

01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:56.934
You wanna see him?

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.202
No.

01:04:58.203 --> 01:05:00.371
We got what we came for.

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:17.388
Keep on keepin' on, boys.

01:05:17.389 --> 01:05:19.490
Wait, wait a minute.

01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:21.459
Annie?

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:24.062
Beg your pardon?

01:05:24.063 --> 01:05:26.231
It's you isn't it? Annie?

01:05:26.232 --> 01:05:27.631
It's me, Mickey.

01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:31.270
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:33.372
I told you to let it go.

01:05:33.373 --> 01:05:35.073
Aw, God!

01:05:35.074 --> 01:05:36.742
I- I did! We did!

01:05:36.743 --> 01:05:37.876
Oh! What the fuck!

01:05:37.877 --> 01:05:40.017
How were we supposed to know
you were gonna be here?

01:05:40.612 --> 01:05:41.914
You fucking bitch!

01:05:41.915 --> 01:05:45.250
I already shot you once,
Beardy-face I will do it again.

01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:47.419
I'm sorry, I told you.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.488
The Orchard is not
what you think it is.

01:05:49.489 --> 01:05:51.423
I can't have you following us.

01:05:51.424 --> 01:05:52.857
Where are your keys?

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.428
- Ben, give her the keys.
- Aw, come on Mickey!

01:05:56.429 --> 01:05:57.830
Ben, give her the
fucking keys, man!

01:05:57.831 --> 01:06:00.030
Alright, alright! Here!

01:06:00.899 --> 01:06:03.167
Here you motherfucker!

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.874
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.809 --> 01:06:12.610
Way to go, Mick!

01:06:12.744 --> 01:06:14.512
There she goes!

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:16.482
The girl that kept you up nights!

01:06:16.483 --> 01:06:17.816
Was she worth it?!

01:06:17.817 --> 01:06:19.617
Huh?!

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.488
You watching?

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.061
You wait till we're gone
before you go after 'em.

01:06:31.296 --> 01:06:33.864
If I see you again,
I'll kill you both.

01:06:42.174 --> 01:06:44.443
They gotta, they gotta be
right around there, Mickey.

01:06:44.444 --> 01:06:45.978
I watched them fall.

01:06:45.979 --> 01:06:48.012
Yeah I know, but...

01:06:49.481 --> 01:06:51.048
I don't know.

01:06:52.684 --> 01:06:54.919
Yeah, okay.

01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:59.356
Alright, just come on in.
We'll find 'em in the morning.

01:07:13.639 --> 01:07:16.106
I'll give you one thing, Mick.

01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:20.110
She wasn't no bull dyke.

01:07:20.178 --> 01:07:22.680
You were right about that.

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.974
<i>Benny.</i>

01:07:50.842 --> 01:07:52.409
<i>Benny.</i>

01:07:52.578 --> 01:07:55.479
<i>What, what? What, Mickey, what?</i>

01:07:56.014 --> 01:07:57.948
Did you hear that?

01:07:58.016 --> 01:07:59.416
<i>What?</i>

01:08:00.385 --> 01:08:02.220
<i>Oh shit!</i>

01:08:02.221 --> 01:08:03.522
<i>Oh shit, oh shit!</i>

01:08:03.523 --> 01:08:05.390
<i>Where's the light?
Where's the flashlight?</i>

01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:07.025
<i>Mickey calm down! Calm down, man.</i>

01:08:07.026 --> 01:08:09.927
<i>Turn the-hit the headlights.</i>

01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:12.764
<i>Oh!</i>

01:08:12.765 --> 01:08:14.433
<i>- Oh no!</i>
<i>- Oh my God!</i>

01:08:14.434 --> 01:08:15.601
<i>We gotta go.</i>

01:08:15.602 --> 01:08:18.435
<i>We gotta go no, come on!</i>

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.241
Ben, come on!

01:08:23.242 --> 01:08:25.377
I can't Mickey, my
fucking leg, man!

01:08:25.377 --> 01:08:26.411
Just go!

01:08:26.412 --> 01:08:27.978
Go!

01:08:31.884 --> 01:08:33.783
Aghhh!

01:08:34.252 --> 01:08:35.786
Oh, they're everywhere!

01:08:38.957 --> 01:08:41.560
Mickey turn off the lights!

01:09:50.462 --> 01:09:53.096
See if I can get any of
these motherfuckers.

01:09:55.867 --> 01:09:57.334
Ahhh!

01:10:06.478 --> 01:10:08.512
Ah, shit.

01:10:12.517 --> 01:10:14.118
Jesus!

01:10:14.519 --> 01:10:17.254
We, ugh! We have to
try to hot wire it!

01:10:17.322 --> 01:10:19.256
What, hot wire the car?

01:10:19.257 --> 01:10:21.993
We've only tried to do it a
dozen God damn times, Mickey.

01:10:21.994 --> 01:10:23.495
There's gotta be a way.

01:10:23.496 --> 01:10:24.496
It's just...

01:10:24.497 --> 01:10:25.864
twisting wires.

01:10:25.865 --> 01:10:27.099
Oh, yeah, in the movies.

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.202
In the fucking movies it's twisting
wires Mickey you're gonna get in there,

01:10:30.203 --> 01:10:32.604
start stripping wires, and
you're gonna fuck everything up!

01:10:32.605 --> 01:10:35.906
It's already fucked up!
Everything is fucked up!

01:10:36.108 --> 01:10:38.276
- They keys are gone!
- Yeah. And why is that?

01:10:38.277 --> 01:10:39.577
Why is that?

01:10:39.578 --> 01:10:40.412
What?

01:10:40.413 --> 01:10:41.780
Why are they keys gone?

01:10:41.781 --> 01:10:43.582
You told me to get
them tomorrow morning.

01:10:43.583 --> 01:10:45.917
No, no why are they in the
fucking field, Mickey?

01:10:45.918 --> 01:10:47.085
Why did I get shot?

01:10:47.086 --> 01:10:48.787
So you're blaming this on me?

01:10:48.788 --> 01:10:50.355
I'm saying...

01:10:50.356 --> 01:10:52.724
they told us that
we weren't welcome

01:10:52.725 --> 01:10:54.591
and you couldn't let it go.

01:10:54.726 --> 01:10:56.728
I told you not to
sugarcoat this girl.

01:10:56.729 --> 01:10:59.263
That it was gonna bite ya,
and now look where we are.

01:10:59.765 --> 01:11:04.735
Maybe if we just lay low, and
shut up, they'll go away.

01:11:05.203 --> 01:11:07.471
They don't go away, Mickey.

01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:10.507
You know that.

01:11:10.776 --> 01:11:12.943
But shut up anyway.

01:12:25.517 --> 01:12:26.917
Hey.

01:12:29.955 --> 01:12:33.590
How much water you think a person's
supposed to have everyday.

01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:36.260
I have no idea.

01:12:42.534 --> 01:12:45.102
How many days you think that is?

01:12:56.982 --> 01:12:58.448
Hey.

01:12:58.683 --> 01:12:59.918
- Hey.
- What's up? What?

01:12:59.919 --> 01:13:02.252
What about what we did
up in Pittsfield?

01:13:02.721 --> 01:13:04.055
What about it?

01:13:04.056 --> 01:13:05.889
Do you think it would work?

01:13:09.694 --> 01:13:11.096
No.

01:13:11.097 --> 01:13:13.230
I don't see how.

01:13:13.698 --> 01:13:16.166
I mean, that was a two
story house, Mickey.

01:13:16.167 --> 01:13:19.636
There was a little bit more
wiggle room, don't you think?

01:13:23.408 --> 01:13:26.577
This sound is driving me crazy.

01:13:27.212 --> 01:13:29.446
It's kinda nice, I think.

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:31.481
Soothing.

01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:36.887
Like rain on a tin roof.

01:14:30.608 --> 01:14:32.009
You done?

01:14:32.777 --> 01:14:35.345
Can't look at their
fucking faces anymore.

01:14:42.654 --> 01:14:47.991
Let's see, what do you
want, you want uh, tuna?

01:14:50.195 --> 01:14:52.663
Luncheon loaf?

01:14:54.933 --> 01:14:57.234
Chicken I think.

01:14:57.502 --> 01:15:00.372
Umm, chicken I guess.

01:15:00.373 --> 01:15:03.008
Okay, you wanna split
a can of peas, too?

01:15:03.009 --> 01:15:04.675
Sure.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:37.242
Oh wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, don't...

01:15:37.243 --> 01:15:39.209
don't eat that.

01:15:41.846 --> 01:15:43.714
Lemme get that...

01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:55.693
Oh, come on. That's disgusting.

01:15:55.694 --> 01:15:57.694
Yeah.

01:15:57.862 --> 01:16:01.431
Wait till we have to
start saving our piss.

01:16:17.882 --> 01:16:19.883
Shut up!

01:16:19.884 --> 01:16:24.287
Shut up! Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:35.465
"Like rain on a tin roof."

01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:37.634
Shut up.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.248
I have an idea.

01:16:54.052 --> 01:16:55.954
Let's get shitfaced.

01:16:55.955 --> 01:16:57.155
That's not an idea.

01:16:57.156 --> 01:16:58.623
It's a great idea.

01:16:58.624 --> 01:17:00.457
How's that gonna help?

01:17:00.592 --> 01:17:03.360
I think we should celebrate.

01:17:03.394 --> 01:17:05.096
What? What are you talking about?

01:17:05.097 --> 01:17:07.132
Celebrate what?

01:17:07.133 --> 01:17:09.800
I don't know.

01:17:11.002 --> 01:17:14.438
Last night on earth, maybe?

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.674
That's depressing.

01:17:20.011 --> 01:17:21.146
Okay!

01:17:21.147 --> 01:17:23.014
It's the source of infection!

01:17:23.015 --> 01:17:25.183
We figured it out!

01:17:25.184 --> 01:17:26.951
We fucking figured it out!

01:17:26.952 --> 01:17:28.319
Oh my God!

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.256
No, no! Don't do the
other one! Don't!

01:17:31.257 --> 01:17:35.193
- This one's really bad! It's really bad!
- I'm taking the socks off too!

01:17:35.194 --> 01:17:37.595
- Not the socks!
- Ahhhh!

01:17:37.596 --> 01:17:41.966
Come on! No!!! No! No!

01:17:41.967 --> 01:17:43.034
Oh come on!

01:17:43.035 --> 01:17:45.036
- Ewww
- It's not that bad.

01:17:45.037 --> 01:17:47.438
It's not that bad!

01:17:47.439 --> 01:17:48.973
Just say it man.

01:17:48.974 --> 01:17:50.808
- Say what?
- Say it!

01:17:50.809 --> 01:17:52.610
Say it! Say it! Say the "Z" word!

01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:53.977
No.

01:17:53.978 --> 01:17:56.548
- No way.
- Why not?

01:17:56.549 --> 01:17:58.783
Because they're not real.

01:17:58.784 --> 01:18:01.119
Oh they're fucking real.
They're pretty fucking real.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.354
Come on, you know what I mean.

01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:09.226
Let's do "Ro Shambo" you gotta
drink if you lose, alright?

01:18:17.468 --> 01:18:20.871
- Oh! Come on!
- Fuck you.

01:18:24.676 --> 01:18:28.245
I'm trapped in a fucking car.

01:18:29.047 --> 01:18:30.315
And I wish I had...

01:18:30.316 --> 01:18:33.483
air conditioning.

01:18:33.484 --> 01:18:36.786
Okay, I wanna win one.

01:18:38.823 --> 01:18:40.757
Fuck!

01:18:41.826 --> 01:18:43.261
Let's switch it up.

01:18:43.262 --> 01:18:46.831
Say they got fangs, and
they're sucking fucking blood

01:18:46.832 --> 01:18:49.167
and they're burning up in the sun.

01:18:49.168 --> 01:18:52.003
And you have a crucifix,
and they can't eat garlic...

01:18:52.004 --> 01:18:53.938
- What do you call 'em?
- Fuck you!

01:18:53.939 --> 01:18:57.108
Yeah, exactly. I'm just saying... if it
walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...

01:18:57.109 --> 01:18:59.609
it's probably a fucking zombie!

01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:07.417
Ohhhh!!!

01:19:07.885 --> 01:19:09.721
Trapped in a fucking car,

01:19:09.722 --> 01:19:13.223
I wish I had air conditioning,
balloons, cheese...

01:19:13.391 --> 01:19:15.892
and dynamite.

01:19:17.095 --> 01:19:19.264
I'm trapped in fucking car...

01:19:19.265 --> 01:19:25.302
and I wish I had air
conditioning, balloons, cheese,

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:28.004
dynamite,

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:33.410
and every Beatles album.

01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:35.278
Yeah.

01:19:39.951 --> 01:19:42.120
- Yeeeesssssss!
- Nooooooooo!

01:19:42.121 --> 01:19:44.821
- Drink for beating me!
- Okay.

01:19:46.291 --> 01:19:49.761
And then you just jump over
'em and you get the keys!

01:19:49.762 --> 01:19:52.163
But I couldn't find
the keys when...

01:19:52.164 --> 01:19:54.565
when there weren't
fifty fucking zombies,

01:19:54.566 --> 01:19:57.402
How am I supposed to...

01:19:57.403 --> 01:19:58.569
- Wait a minute, wait.
- What?

01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:00.071
What did you just say?

01:20:00.072 --> 01:20:02.440
Say it again. Say it again.

01:20:02.441 --> 01:20:03.808
- Ohhhh...
- Say it again.

01:20:03.809 --> 01:20:05.443
What did you say? Say the word.

01:20:05.444 --> 01:20:06.811
- Fifty...
- Say it.

01:20:06.812 --> 01:20:10.281
- Zombies!
- Zombies! Ha ha haaa!

01:20:10.282 --> 01:20:12.784
Alright. Okay, okay, okay.

01:20:23.529 --> 01:20:29.633
<i>♪ I'm tired and I
wanna go to bed. ♪</i>

01:20:29.767 --> 01:20:35.273

- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow we die.

01:21:04.069 --> 01:21:07.338
Okay.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:41.738
Mickey, you can do this, man.

01:21:44.609 --> 01:21:46.543
You can do it.

01:21:50.581 --> 01:21:52.216
You say low.

01:21:52.217 --> 01:21:54.417
And go hard.

01:21:56.287 --> 01:21:58.621
You'll be fine.

01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:27.784
Mickey?

01:22:29.086 --> 01:22:31.654
If you don't find the keys,

01:22:33.124 --> 01:22:35.325
don't come back.

01:22:36.327 --> 01:22:38.995
I'm not leaving you here.

01:22:39.897 --> 01:22:41.664
Ben.

01:22:41.766 --> 01:22:44.000
I can do this.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.347
Come on Mickey.

01:27:58.916 --> 01:28:01.284
Come on, Mickey, man.

01:28:07.625 --> 01:28:09.992
Fuck, fuck.

01:28:24.842 --> 01:28:30.012
Come on, Mickey. Come on, come on.

01:28:32.249 --> 01:28:34.117
Come on, Mickey.

01:29:12.723 --> 01:29:14.023
Benny!!

01:29:20.966 --> 01:29:22.499
Oh my God!

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:24.835
Mickey! Mickey!

01:29:27.806 --> 01:29:29.340
Come on, buddy!

01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:30.873
Come on!

01:29:34.212 --> 01:29:36.981
Did you get 'em? Mickey!

01:29:36.982 --> 01:29:39.015
Did you get 'em?!

01:29:39.216 --> 01:29:40.850
Mick?

01:29:41.051 --> 01:29:42.952
Mickey.

01:29:43.087 --> 01:29:45.755
Mickey, did you get the keys?

01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:48.057
Mick?

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:50.226
Mick, what's wrong?

01:29:50.895 --> 01:29:53.898
Mickey, Mickey were you bit?

01:29:53.899 --> 01:29:55.900
Oh my God!!

01:29:55.901 --> 01:29:57.735
Mickey, are you bit?!

01:29:57.736 --> 01:30:00.404
Oh fuck!! Mickey!!!

01:30:00.405 --> 01:30:02.339
- Oh Jesus!!!
- No Ben!!

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.073
Mickey!

01:30:03.074 --> 01:30:04.742
- Please Ben!
- Mickey!

01:30:04.743 --> 01:30:06.210
Oh fuck!

01:30:06.211 --> 01:30:07.444
Ohh!

01:30:07.445 --> 01:30:09.413
Oh God!

01:30:09.414 --> 01:30:11.514
- Oh God!
- What do I do?!

01:30:11.515 --> 01:30:13.417
What do I do?!

01:30:13.418 --> 01:30:15.753
Ben, please!

01:30:15.754 --> 01:30:18.188
Ben! What do I do, please!

01:30:18.189 --> 01:30:19.056
Oh God dammit!

01:30:19.057 --> 01:30:20.858
- Don't shut down...
- God dammit!!

01:30:20.859 --> 01:30:23.260
Please! Tell me what do I do?!

01:30:23.261 --> 01:30:24.794
I'm scared!

01:30:29.366 --> 01:30:30.766
Ben!

01:30:31.035 --> 01:30:32.636
Ben, please don't shut down on me!

01:30:32.637 --> 01:30:33.404
- Mickey!
- No!

01:30:33.405 --> 01:30:34.438
Ben, no!

01:30:34.439 --> 01:30:35.439
Put the gun away!

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.641
- You gotta get outta the car.
- No, you can't!

01:30:37.642 --> 01:30:38.742
You gotta get outta the car, man...

01:30:38.743 --> 01:30:41.545
- I can't!
- Get outta the fucking car!!!

01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:47.785
Mickey get out!!!

01:30:47.786 --> 01:30:49.954
- You can't do this!
- I have to, Mickey!

01:30:49.955 --> 01:30:50.987
You know it!

01:30:50.988 --> 01:30:52.890
God dammit!!!

01:30:52.891 --> 01:30:53.757
Please let me stay!

01:30:53.758 --> 01:30:55.793
Get outta the fucking car, Mickey!

01:30:55.794 --> 01:30:58.462
- Please!
- Oh, God!

01:30:58.463 --> 01:30:59.830
- Ben!
- Ohh!

01:30:59.831 --> 01:31:01.198
- Ben!
- Oh my God!

01:31:39.937 --> 01:31:42.138
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

01:31:53.484 --> 01:31:55.853
You know, me and Mickey we
were <i>trapped in a house</i>

01:31:55.854 --> 01:31:59.221
<i>for three months
when it all started.</i>

01:32:00.324 --> 01:32:03.225
<i>Had to board up the windows.</i>

01:32:03.894 --> 01:32:06.862
<i>Block out the sunlight.</i>

01:32:08.198 --> 01:32:11.267
<i>You ever been inside,
in one place...</i>

01:32:11.668 --> 01:32:13.703
<i>for that long?</i>

01:32:15.205 --> 01:32:18.509
<i>Listening to the
same sound, all day.</i>

01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:20.576
<i>Every day.</i>

01:32:28.419 --> 01:32:32.054
<i>It does something to you.</i>

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:44.867
Annie.

01:32:51.442 --> 01:32:54.210
<i>Are you listening?</i>

01:32:58.949 --> 01:33:01.919
I bet you are.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.453
Oh I bet you are.

01:33:08.092 --> 01:33:10.193
<i>Mickey didn't make it.</i>

01:33:10.194 --> 01:33:12.228
<i>Because of you.</i>

01:33:14.898 --> 01:33:16.465
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:33:32.316 --> 01:33:34.650
<i>It's funny.</i>

01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:38.254
<i>How we finally got
outta that house.</i>

01:33:40.124 --> 01:33:42.792
<i>We just opened the door.</i>

01:33:44.261 --> 01:33:47.965
<i>They all tried to pile in
one side, and we just...</i>

01:33:47.966 --> 01:33:50.132
<i>went out the other.</i>

01:33:54.771 --> 01:33:57.006
<i>All that time.</i>

01:33:57.174 --> 01:33:59.708
<i>And it was that easy.</i>

01:34:00.944 --> 01:34:02.411
<i>Just...</i>

01:34:02.412 --> 01:34:04.313
<i>let 'em in.</i>

01:34:12.122 --> 01:34:15.491
I think I'm gonna try it again.

01:34:17.327 --> 01:34:19.596
If it doesn't work this time...

01:34:19.597 --> 01:34:23.833
<i>I'm just gonna put a
bullet in my head.</i>

01:34:25.169 --> 01:34:28.171
<i>But if it does...</i>

01:34:28.172 --> 01:34:31.474
<i>I'm gonna come and
put one in yours.</i>
