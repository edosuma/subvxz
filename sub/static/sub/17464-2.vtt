I'm going to Nashville.

39:11.449 --> 39:15.761

39:17.419 --> 39:19.725
I think that's a good idea.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.830
It was nice of you to make flapjacks.

39:28.335 --> 39:30.557
(SIGHS) Kind of like the old days.

- You hate everyone who lives here?
- (DOOR OPENS)

39:57.562 --> 39:59.998
Pretty much.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.504
I got a proposition.

40:06.505 --> 40:07.699
Okay.

40:08.641 --> 40:09.996
Let's trade places.

40:11.095 --> 40:12.075
What?

40:12.076 --> 40:14.812
You go stay with your
mother, and I come here.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.414
Don't you have a mortgage?

40:16.415 --> 40:18.649
You've got, what, two
months left on your lease?

40:18.650 --> 40:19.910
Thereabouts.

40:21.111 --> 40:23.553
So, I come here, I'll
pay half your rent,

40:23.554 --> 40:26.055
and in two months, you've got
close to 1,000 bucks saved up

40:26.056 --> 40:28.024
for a down payment on a
car, free and clear.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.794
Why would I pay half the rent?

40:29.795 --> 40:31.746
Because you need a car, and I don't.

40:32.292 --> 40:33.745
But you need something.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.200
Not really.

40:37.201 --> 40:39.937
I hope you don't sell tires like this.

40:40.864 --> 40:42.027
Okay.

40:42.773 --> 40:46.824
Truth is, I never thought I'd
be at the house this long.

40:47.545 --> 40:50.513
I come home, there's Dad.
I go to work, there's Dad.

40:52.616 --> 40:56.787
- I can't do it anymore.
- So, I would be doing you the favor?

40:57.607 --> 40:58.722
It'd be mutual.

40:59.298 --> 41:00.890
Wouldn't pay half the
rent, tell you that.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.760
- 25%?
- Hell, no.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.196
If you stay here, you
pay the rent in full.

41:05.197 --> 41:07.308
Okay. (SIGHS) I'll pay the rent.
