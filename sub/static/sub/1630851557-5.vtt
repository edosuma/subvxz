WEBVTT

00:14.389 --> 00:16.265
Oh. No, no, no.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.352
No, no, no! No, no!

00:19.019 --> 00:20.020
Crap!

00:28.987 --> 00:30.572
Hey!

00:39.831 --> 00:42.417
-What happened, Chad?
-I screwed up. Bad.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.253
My mom's gonna be so mad.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.964
Or worse… disappointed.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.048
It can't be that bad.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.092
Just take a deep breath
and tell me what's wrong.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.386
Did you lock a guest in the sauna again?

00:53.178 --> 00:55.097
Oh, God. I-- I don't think so.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.682
No, no. This is worse. This is worse.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.101
My mom told me to place an order.
I totally forgot.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.563
And now the whole resort is out of coffee.

01:08.527 --> 01:09.528
So what?

01:09.611 --> 01:11.488
What do you mean, "So what"?

01:11.572 --> 01:14.575
What's the big deal?
There's no coffee. Whatever.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.911
Hugo, you might be too young
to understand this,

01:17.995 --> 01:21.540
but for adults, coffee is life.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.168
It's the one thing that keeps us going

01:24.251 --> 01:26.920
until it's late enough in the day
to turn to alcohol.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.131
I like to put a little brandy in my coffee

01:29.214 --> 01:31.175
around 2:00, 2:30 to bridge the gap.

01:32.801 --> 01:33.969
I wish it was 2:30.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.721
It's 3:15.

01:35.804 --> 01:36.805
Really?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.516
In that case…

01:49.860 --> 01:54.031
Fine hotels require fine coffee.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.284
It's only one of the thousands of details

01:57.367 --> 02:00.287
that needs to be perfect
at a place like Las Colinas.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.625
And just one of the many problems
we faced that night.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.545
We were all up late after
working overtime for that big wedding.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.882
I was just about to end my shift when…

02:12.508 --> 02:14.134
Well, maybe this was a mistake!

02:14.218 --> 02:16.303
-Oh, my God.
-Excuse me!

02:16.386 --> 02:17.721
-Are you okay?
-Yes, thank you.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.184
Did I just get knocked over
by a very formal cowboy?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.393
Welcome to Texas.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.561
That is so weird.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.605
-I thought we were in Mexico.
-Not tonight.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.066
The daughter of an oil baron
just got married here.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.318
Sounds like an episode of Dallas.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.111
Except J.R. was leading a conga line.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.072
What are you doing up so late?

02:35.155 --> 02:38.700
-Or up so early? I can't tell.
-I just got in with my parents,

02:38.784 --> 02:41.161
and I couldn't sleep,
so I wanted to come down here to read.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.038
But obviously…

02:43.121 --> 02:44.998
Sleep. I'm on my way there now.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.417
-I'm exhausted.
-You're leaving me already?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.253
Don't worry. I'll be back here soon,

02:49.336 --> 02:50.712
getting people drinks at the pool.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.005
Okay. Well, you better rest up

02:52.089 --> 02:54.258
because I'm gonna be needing
a lot of margaritas.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.677
In that case, I should sneak out
before someone sees me and--

02:56.760 --> 02:59.096
Ay, Máximo.
Thank God you're still here.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.098
This is all your fault.

03:01.473 --> 03:02.641
Sorry.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.561
-Is there a problem?
-The problem is

03:05.644 --> 03:08.522
Chad's lived here for three years
and he can barely speak Spanish.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.358
The only words he knows how
to say are "buenas nachos."

03:11.441 --> 03:13.402
I think Beto taught him
a few bad words too.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.697
He needs some help with some phone calls
while I help Mónica with the wedding.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.240
-Do you mind?
-Of course not.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.741
-Thank you.
-What else do I have to do

03:19.825 --> 03:20.868
at 4:00 in the morning?

03:22.411 --> 03:23.537
Monica, what happened?

03:23.620 --> 03:24.705
I don't know what to do.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.915
It's past 4:00 a.m.
and the wedding is still going on.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.917
Really?
But I thought they were gringos.

03:29.001 --> 03:32.129
They are.
They're usually all asleep by midnight.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.214
That's why I thought it was okay
to book this space

03:34.298 --> 03:37.634
for a 6:00 a.m. breakfast
for 100 plastic surgeons.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.386
No way,
you can't just tell them to wrap it up.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.180
No, that's hotel policy.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.348
The party ends when the party ends.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.017
I've tried everything to get them to go.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.894
-Did you turn all the lights off?
-Yes.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.437
-Did you turn all the lights on?
-Yes!

03:48.520 --> 03:50.314
Did you turn all the lights off and on,
off and on?

03:50.397 --> 03:51.565
Yes, yes, yes.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.358
And you tried playing slow songs?

03:53.442 --> 03:55.194
"Against All Odds" four times in a row.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.362
Oh, I love that song. It makes me cry.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.364
Julia, focus. I haven't slept in two days.

04:00.240 --> 04:06.288
Please, find a way to end this party
without asking them to leave.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.998
I've seen you with the guests.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.083
You're, like,
the gringo whisperer.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.335
Do people call me that?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.212
After tonight, they will.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.798
I can cover the front desk for you
while I prep for the breakfast.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.177
Don't you worry, I'll take care of it.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.517
The gringo whisperer.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.728
Nice.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.898
No, I don't need a whole café.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.067
No, I don't understand what you're saying.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.985
Hello?

04:37.819 --> 04:40.697
So, you need help with some phone calls?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.283
Yes! Thank you. Oh, my gosh.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.786
I don't know why people talk so fast
when they're not speaking English.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.747
Yeah, I've always wondered that.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.084
I didn't find out until much later,

04:52.167 --> 04:54.378
but someone else in my family

04:54.962 --> 04:56.839
was also awake at that time.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.718
Hi.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.265
We can't wake my mom up, stupid!

05:06.640 --> 05:07.558
You're stupid!

05:08.725 --> 05:09.893
Did you get it?

05:11.061 --> 05:13.772
We could get in so much trouble for this.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.113
Poltergeist!

05:28.620 --> 05:29.913
Are you scared?

05:30.038 --> 05:31.832
Of the movie? Nah.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.042
Of getting caught by your mom... ?

05:40.799 --> 05:43.385
Baby, come on. Take a deep breath.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.262
I love him.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.723
Come here, baby.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.602
Memo, what happened?

05:52.394 --> 05:55.981
So, everyone was having fun
until the groom came up to the bride

05:56.064 --> 05:57.733
and shoved a piece of cake in her face.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.026
What?

05:59.234 --> 06:00.235
Then she screamed.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.571
Then they started fighting.
Then he said, "You're being ridiculous!"

06:02.654 --> 06:04.698
Then she said,
"It was a mistake to marry you."

06:05.282 --> 06:06.700
And then he stormed off.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.661
It was amazing…

06:10.454 --> 06:11.747
and very sad.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.665
Come on,
let's go back to your room.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.334
-No!
-You can talk things over

06:15.417 --> 06:17.461
-with Bobby tomorrow.
-N-O.

06:17.544 --> 06:21.632
I ain't leaving till he comes back
and apologizes for ruining the wedding.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.467
Memo, if we want this party to end,

06:23.550 --> 06:25.469
we have to get the bride
and groom together again.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.720
Go find the groom.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.804
At your service.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.557
Señor groom!

06:31.683 --> 06:34.186
...Oh, you don't have any coffee to spare?

06:34.269 --> 06:36.271
What's he saying?
Do they have coffee? Do they deliver?

06:36.438 --> 06:38.065
Yes,
I also find all the shouting annoying...

06:38.148 --> 06:39.650
Tell them you wanna speak to the manager.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.568
You threaten 'em.
That's how we do it in America.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.529
-It's the US, not America.
-What?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.697
Nothing. They also said no.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.909
And we've called all the other hotels.
What am I-- What am I gonna do?

06:50.994 --> 06:52.955
I loved watching Chad panic.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.460
But then I realized

06:58.544 --> 07:03.632
this was my perfect opportunity
to impress Julia by saving the day.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.510
So this friend of yours
is going to meet us where?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.637
At the marina. It's not far.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.890
No, that sounds dicey.
I am not taking my Corvette to the marina.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.434
And I only have keys for
one of the resort vehicles.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.812
Okay. Then what are we taking?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.075
Don Pablo!

07:30.534 --> 07:32.828
Why are you awake at this time of night?

07:32.911 --> 07:35.414
That's none of your business.
What do you want?

07:35.497 --> 07:37.249
I'm looking for a groom.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.668
Well, I'm flattered but not interested.

07:39.751 --> 07:40.752
What?

07:40.836 --> 07:42.921
No!
The groom from the wedding.

07:43.172 --> 07:43.630
Really?

07:44.256 --> 07:45.465
The wedding hasn't ended?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.718
I thought they were all gringos.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.470
They are.
But there was a very dramatic incident

07:50.554 --> 07:52.639
and now the bride won't leave
until the groom comes back.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.559
Then I should find that groom.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.229
I suppose you're coming with me?

07:59.313 --> 08:00.397
I would love to.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.940
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry.

08:02.024 --> 08:05.068
I totally zoned out
for the last few minutes.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.196
-What happened?
-Are you kidding me?

08:07.279 --> 08:09.615
I'm sorry, I'm interested.

08:09.698 --> 08:13.869
It's just this scalp massage is excellent.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.997
As I was saying,

08:17.080 --> 08:19.499
I called my friend at the docks
to get coffee for Chad.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.295
You're kidding me.
What the hell is this thing?

08:23.962 --> 08:26.673
It's a calandria.
They're everywhere in Acapulco.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.176
You really don't get out much, do you?

08:30.093 --> 08:32.179
No. Why would I?
The resort has everything.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.807
Everything except coffee.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.191
Diane, what are you doing here?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.610
I just had a late night
out with investors.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.488
All I wanted was some peace and quiet.
What's happening?

08:49.571 --> 08:52.574
I haven't seen hair this big
since the '79 Daytime Emmys.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.243
I was robbed, by the way.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.412
-The wedding is still going on, but--
-Obviously the wedding is still going on.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.498
-Where's Mónica?
-She's prepping for breakfast.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.875
-I'm-- I'm covering for her.
-I'm sure you are.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.879
Meanwhile, I'll take care of this
and you can go back to the front desk.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.924
Technically, we never shut down a party,

09:09.007 --> 09:10.300
but there are tactful ways…

09:10.384 --> 09:14.012
…to make the guests feel like
they decided the party's over.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.813
Well, hello!

09:23.313 --> 09:26.400
I'm Diane, the owner of Las Colinas.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.945
I wanna thank you all
for choosing our hotel

09:30.028 --> 09:33.532
by sending chilaquiles to your room.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.868
You're Diane Davies!

09:37.286 --> 09:39.454
-I love you.
-Thank you.

09:39.538 --> 09:43.250
Anyway, if you all wanna go wait
for your chilaquiles--

09:43.333 --> 09:46.420
I used your workout tapes
to fit into this darn dress.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.424
Well, my tapes must have worked

09:50.507 --> 09:53.552
because you look fabulous.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.014
Get over here
and tell me what else you love about me.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.058
-Well, I would love to.
-Can we get another round here?

10:00.142 --> 10:02.728
Have a seat. Let's drink up, sister.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.356
Memo, hurry up and find the groom.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.233
Memo, now!

10:08.317 --> 10:12.029
It's nice we get to spend
this time together, sir. Bonding.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.239
We're not bonding.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.578
And now you're doing that joke where you--

10:19.661 --> 10:22.080
you pretend to be annoyed by me.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.758
I've always wondered
about that table you have set up.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.802
Maybe you just need someone to talk to...

10:36.053 --> 10:38.639
Someone who will take
your secrets to his grave.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.556
No.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.600
And that's the end of the conversation.

10:42.601 --> 10:43.936
I'm sorry, sir.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.899
Were you waiting for a lady friend?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.276
Someone who broke your heart?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.570
A lost love who will never return?

10:53.654 --> 10:55.781
I can give you some wise advice.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.242
I know all about women.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.201
You?

11:00.202 --> 11:01.495
I'm sure!

11:07.626 --> 11:08.961
Is this neighborhood safe?

11:09.044 --> 11:11.672
It seems kinda sketchy.
I don't like that we don't have doors.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.382
I live around here.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.801
Oh, man. You must be scared all the time.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.804
Yeah. This place is a real nightmare.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.264
What's up, Tuercas.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.516
Man, that sucks. Yeah.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.394
I know from the movies
how many Mexican criminals there are.

11:25.978 --> 11:29.022
You know the movies don't
show things as they really are, right?

11:30.524 --> 11:31.817
Yeah. That's true, you know.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.487
They told me there'd be
a lot more sombreros down here.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.617
So this guy we're meeting,
he's a good guy, right?

11:41.118 --> 11:43.161
No, Chad. He's a bad guy.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.664
Oh, man. Are we gonna be okay?

11:45.747 --> 11:48.709
If I had to listen to Chad
being ignorant all night,

11:48.792 --> 11:50.794
I was gonna have a little fun with it.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.962
You know what?

11:53.630 --> 11:56.258
Just play it cool and don't upset him.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.260
Then we'll be okay.

11:59.845 --> 12:00.888
Yep.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.515
Maybe this night
wouldn't be so bad after all.

12:04.433 --> 12:07.311
And if you're familiar
with Fonda's first video,

12:07.394 --> 12:11.607
you will clearly see
she stole that move from me.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.901
Give me scissors, ladies.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.906
Young guy. Tuxedo. Cowboy hat.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.158
We've found our groom.

12:21.783 --> 12:22.993
Señor groom!

12:23.577 --> 12:25.078
We need to get you back to the wedding.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.581
Uh-uh. No, sir. I ain't going nowhere.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.139
You think she heard us?

12:44.223 --> 12:45.766
I don't know.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.492
Is everything okay?

13:03.867 --> 13:06.370
Uh... yeah... sorry...

13:06.453 --> 13:08.872
I had a nightmare.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.500
That's what happens
when you have a heavy dinner.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.044
And then you fall asleep watching TV.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.421
Sorry, mom. Yeah,
I think dinner didn't sit well with me.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.632
But go back to sleep!

13:19.216 --> 13:21.343
I'll go back to my room.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.304
Okay then.

13:40.279 --> 13:42.573
- Ready?
- Yes.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.672
Wow. This must be where all the criminals
come to dispose the bodies.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.426
You know, in America, we have this thing,
the Italian Mafia. Those guys are no joke.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.225
Remember, be cool.
Don't let him sense your fear.

14:10.309 --> 14:11.393
I'm not scared.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.605
Hey Martin.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.151
Is this the guerito
who forgot to order coffee?

14:19.985 --> 14:22.821
Is he talking about me? I heard "güerito."
I know that means "Chad" in Spanish.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.991
How are you? How's Sarita?

14:26.074 --> 14:27.868
She's good. How's your mom?

14:27.951 --> 14:28.744
Good.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.915
Does she still make
that amazing octopus ceviche?

14:34.708 --> 14:36.418
What does she do to make it so tender?

14:36.877 --> 14:39.796
Well you just gotta slam it real hard.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.590
Let's see, show me how.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.345
Well, after you get it out of the water...

14:46.720 --> 14:48.347
you have to grab them hard...

14:48.472 --> 14:50.182
They like to fight--

14:50.599 --> 14:52.226
Right? Then you just hit them.

14:55.103 --> 14:58.148
If you see a rock, grab it... a rock and…

15:00.734 --> 15:03.111
Whatever you can, even here in the back.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.780
What's he saying?

15:04.863 --> 15:07.908
He's telling me
about this tourist he murdered last night.

15:08.659 --> 15:09.660
Cool, cool.

15:09.743 --> 15:14.581
You know? You can also hit all its body...
the tentacles...

15:14.665 --> 15:15.749
Like this, like this.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.504
Poor things... but they're so tasty.

15:22.297 --> 15:25.717
The coffee's in my truck. Should we go?

15:31.306 --> 15:32.683
Thank you so much Martin.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.477
You know who I'm impressed with?

15:36.228 --> 15:37.312
Hollywood.

15:37.396 --> 15:39.773
Their movie bad guys
look exactly like that guy.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.860
Why is he backing up?

15:44.027 --> 15:47.739
Hey, I actually have some ceviche here...

15:47.823 --> 15:49.241
He's got a gun! I'm flooring it!

15:55.747 --> 15:57.791
Get down! Get down! Get down!

15:59.418 --> 16:02.212
No, no, no! It's out of power.

16:03.922 --> 16:04.798
Chad!

16:05.591 --> 16:06.592
Chad!

16:06.675 --> 16:07.843
Güerito!

16:08.719 --> 16:12.097
Why don't we get back to
the happiest day of your life?

16:12.181 --> 16:15.642
It was the happiest day of my life
till Debbie ruined it.

16:16.351 --> 16:19.354
Well, you already married her.

16:20.105 --> 16:24.902
So I think it's better not to try
to understand and just go along.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.613
Women are too complicated.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.239
Ain't that the truth.

16:29.323 --> 16:33.160
Actually, they're not that complicated.

16:33.994 --> 16:37.289
You just have to think about things
from their point of view.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.334
For example…

16:42.544 --> 16:45.672
Debbie spent hours
doing her hair and makeup

16:45.756 --> 16:48.050
just to look perfect
on this important day.

16:48.133 --> 16:53.180
So maybe shoving cake in her face
seemed insensitive to her.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.726
I never really thought about it that way.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.062
All right, you know what?

17:01.188 --> 17:04.775
If she apologizes to me first
for all the mean things she said,

17:05.526 --> 17:07.069
then I'll apologize to her.

17:08.278 --> 17:11.323
You do know about women. How?

17:12.115 --> 17:13.909
I have a lot of sisters.

17:16.703 --> 17:21.083
Two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, and dance.

17:21.666 --> 17:25.045
Just when it seemed
the wedding had hit its low point,

17:25.546 --> 17:26.755
it got even lower.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.884
What is such a beautiful woman like you
doing here all alone?

17:33.178 --> 17:35.305
Whatever man left you
like this doesn't deserve you.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.766
No, no, no!

17:37.850 --> 17:40.227
To the right.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.563
No.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.606
Listen, Debbie. I--

17:44.690 --> 17:47.818
I know how you're feeling.
Men can be the worst.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.736
The worst.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.613
But they could also be the best.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.532
The best.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.078
My boyfriend can make
really bad decisions,

17:58.161 --> 18:03.584
but he also has this thing
where he knows exactly when I'm hungry.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.253
It's like a sixth sense.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.464
He'll suddenly show up to the front desk
with the snack I've been craving.

18:09.548 --> 18:10.716
Yeah.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.136
I'm sure there are things
about Bobby that you really like.

18:15.554 --> 18:19.057
Well, he's really good at carving turkey.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.644
Okay. That's a good start.

18:22.728 --> 18:23.937
Move to the right.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.902
Go on. Tell him.
Tell him how much he means to you.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.737
All right, everybody, keep going!

18:31.820 --> 18:34.406
Linda, be careful in those heels.

18:35.657 --> 18:36.658
Bobby?

18:38.076 --> 18:39.203
I'm sorry.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.705
Forget everything I said.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.041
No, no, no, sugar pie. I'm sorry.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.460
Bobby.

18:57.513 --> 19:00.432
Now this wedding can finally end.

19:00.516 --> 19:02.726
Now this wedding can finally end.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.521
Let's get this party started, y'all!

19:12.110 --> 19:14.154
Moving on to the bridesmaids.

19:43.475 --> 19:46.353
Well, if we were in America,
we could've called AAA.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.021
The US.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.274
Yeah, America.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.859
We are in America, Chad.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.527
You mean the United States.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.612
America's a continent, not a country.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.906
Why do all estadounidenses
talk like they own that word?

19:57.990 --> 20:00.617
-Esta-what?
-Estadounidenses.

20:00.701 --> 20:03.161
It means
"people of the United States of America."

20:03.745 --> 20:05.581
A word that doesn't even exist in English.

20:05.664 --> 20:06.999
But of course you don't know that.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.543
You've been here for three years
and you hardly speak any Spanish.

20:09.626 --> 20:10.878
Why should I? So I could understand

20:10.961 --> 20:13.213
what that criminal was saying
when he tried to kill me?

20:13.297 --> 20:14.381
Martín's not a criminal.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.799
I was just messing with you.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.343
What do you mean
you were just messing with me?

20:18.427 --> 20:20.053
I was messing with you.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.848
Máximo, what the hell?
I was really scared.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.391
Of course you were scared.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.476
You think this place
is just like the movies

20:26.560 --> 20:28.896
because you barely ever set foot
outside your mom's resort.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.481
You act better than us,
you don't try to learn our names.

20:31.565 --> 20:34.276
You wouldn't even stand up
for your own girlfriend at that dinner.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.611
Why is Julia even dating you?

20:47.414 --> 20:48.582
I'm sorry, Chad.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.502
I haven't slept in 26 hours
and I'm going mad.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.670
Please, forget what I said.

20:53.754 --> 20:54.755
No, you're right.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.216
You know what? I don't really know
why she's dating me either.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.343
All I do is screw things up.

20:59.927 --> 21:02.846
And what kind of jerk doesn't even
defend his own girlfriend?

21:02.930 --> 21:04.598
I'm caught between my mom and Julia.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.893
And doing what's right for one means,
you know, upsetting the other one.

21:08.477 --> 21:10.896
And I made the wrong call at the dinner.
Yeah.

21:11.772 --> 21:14.191
And you know what?
My mom is still disappointed in me.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.069
Come on. I'm sure your mom
isn't disappointed in you.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.529
You know, sometimes she says to me,

21:18.612 --> 21:21.657
"Just because you're my only child,
doesn't mean you're my favorite."

21:22.574 --> 21:24.243
Ohhh wow!

21:26.578 --> 21:28.497
Honestly…

21:32.751 --> 21:34.336
I'm just lonely down here.

21:35.546 --> 21:38.298
Well, you don't have to be lonely.

21:38.799 --> 21:42.427
Just get to know the people around you,
learn the language--

21:42.511 --> 21:43.512
I've tried.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.848
There's just so many words.

21:45.931 --> 21:48.225
I feel like I sound stupid in Spanish.

21:49.601 --> 21:52.020
Well, that feeling you're avoiding,

21:52.896 --> 21:54.857
that's what we have to face every day.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.694
The staff, me, Julia.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.197
You guys make it look so easy.

22:03.115 --> 22:04.408
Trust me, it isn't.

22:06.618 --> 22:08.036
Well, it doesn't matter anyways.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.581
With this last screwup,
there's no way my mom's keeping me on.

22:10.664 --> 22:14.960
It's buenas nachos for Chad.
Back to America.

22:15.043 --> 22:18.088
Sorry, the United States.

22:20.090 --> 22:22.217
Let's face it. It's over.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.526
You guys need help?

22:46.533 --> 22:48.619
-I'm gonna pull the plug.
-Diane,

22:48.702 --> 22:51.955
it will be the first party we've shut down
in 35 years.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.709
-Screw it. I'm exhausted.
-Wait.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.253
I have an idea.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.926
Hi!

23:04.009 --> 23:05.052
-Hey!
-Hello.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.762
I am so sorry to interrupt.

23:06.845 --> 23:08.639
I just wanted to share with you,

23:08.722 --> 23:10.641
something that would make
your wedding more special.

23:11.767 --> 23:15.145
It's a secret Mexican tradition
that I learned when I moved here.

23:15.229 --> 23:16.355
-Okay.
-Yeah.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.190
It's an ancient legend says that

23:18.273 --> 23:21.318
if you watch the sunrise
the morning after your wedding,

23:21.401 --> 23:23.153
you'll have good luck that year.

23:23.237 --> 23:25.739
But if you watch it with
your feet in the ocean,

23:26.240 --> 23:27.574
you'll have good luck forever.

23:28.617 --> 23:30.953
I love how Mexicans are so exotic.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.746
We don't have anything like that
in America.

23:32.829 --> 23:33.830
Nothing. Not a thing.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.208
Well, let's go to the beach
before the sun comes up!

23:36.291 --> 23:38.502
Mom, we're going to the beach!

23:40.212 --> 23:41.630
I never heard of that tradition.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.800
That's because it's bullshit.

23:50.514 --> 23:52.891
Is there some Mexican chant
we should all be singing?

23:54.434 --> 23:55.769
Right in that moment,

23:55.853 --> 23:59.106
Julia could only think of
one Mexican song.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.487
That's the piñata song.

24:05.571 --> 24:06.655
Exactly.

24:11.159 --> 24:16.290
Okay, my darlings. Let's turn it around!

24:16.373 --> 24:18.750
Come on, let's hustle! Pick up the pace!

24:18.834 --> 24:23.547
So, now that you've seen how good I am
with the female mind, sir,

24:24.256 --> 24:25.549
maybe you want to talk to me

24:25.632 --> 24:27.968
about that mysterious lover
you're waiting for?

24:28.552 --> 24:29.761
What was her name again?

24:30.470 --> 24:32.681
Thank you for your kindness, Memo.

24:32.764 --> 24:35.642
Now leave me alone. Good night.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.482
It's the morning, sir.

24:43.066 --> 24:46.153
We're gonna make it! This is awesome!

24:46.236 --> 24:48.906
We're gonna make it.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.407
We're gonna make it.

24:53.202 --> 24:54.369
You know what? You're right.

24:54.453 --> 24:56.079
I should do more things like this.

24:56.163 --> 24:59.208
Spend time with more Mexicanos.
People like you.

24:59.291 --> 25:00.751
No, thank you.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.337
He said he'd love to.

25:03.754 --> 25:05.380
Dude, I don't know a lot of Spanish,

25:05.464 --> 25:07.883
but I do understand
the words "no" and "gracias."

25:58.976 --> 26:00.227
We did it, hamigo.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.896
-"Amigo."
-Yeah. That's what I said.

26:03.939 --> 26:05.816
"Amigo. A-migo."

26:05.899 --> 26:07.985
You did it. You got the coffee.

26:08.068 --> 26:09.736
Yeah, thanks to this guy.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.530
Oh, it was nothing.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.907
Just Máximo saving the day again.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.784
Yay, Máximo.

26:15.868 --> 26:18.036
Hey, listen.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.371
I was thinking,

26:20.289 --> 26:22.249
what if we plan a trip to Colombia?

26:22.332 --> 26:24.626
I really wanna see
the city where you grew up,

26:24.710 --> 26:26.879
and, you know, maybe eat some arepas.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.590
-Oh, my God. That would be amazing.
-And while we figure that out,

26:29.673 --> 26:31.758
we can go down to the beach
you always wanted to go to.

26:31.842 --> 26:34.469
-It's called, "Quesa" or "Quinta"?
-You have something there.

26:34.553 --> 26:36.763
Starts with a "K."

26:36.847 --> 26:39.057
-Marquelia.
-Marquelia.

26:39.141 --> 26:41.518
-Exactly. Yes.
-Wow, that's so--

26:42.227 --> 26:43.979
That's so thoughtful of you. I love you.

26:44.062 --> 26:45.814
I love you.

26:46.815 --> 26:50.068
I felt so, so stupid.

26:51.028 --> 26:52.821
In my efforts to save the day,

26:53.906 --> 26:55.949
I had done the impossible.

26:56.033 --> 26:58.493
I had fixed Chad.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.415
I was devastated, Hugo.

27:03.498 --> 27:06.960
But you know what they say.

27:09.713 --> 27:11.298
"When one door closes…"

27:16.762 --> 27:19.890
Hey.
I thought you were going home already.

27:20.474 --> 27:22.476
I am now, finally.

27:23.101 --> 27:24.937
It's your fault I'm still here.

27:25.020 --> 27:28.273
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to
figure out how to make it up to you.
