WEBVTT

00:08.216 --> 00:10.083
Thank you for
bringing me here.

00:10.085 --> 00:12.102
I am so glad we made
it. That snowstorm

00:12.104 --> 00:13.520
was getting really bad.

00:13.522 --> 00:15.105
Wait, you think
this is a snowstorm?

00:15.107 --> 00:17.724
This is nothing.
I'll tell you about a snowstorm.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.694
It was winter break,
freshman year of college...

00:20.696 --> 00:22.295
<i>Marshall and I were</i>
<i>roommates, but we weren't</i>

00:22.297 --> 00:23.897
<i>- really good friends yet.</i>
<i>- Wait, stop.</i>

00:23.899 --> 00:25.365
You've told me this one before.

00:25.367 --> 00:26.483
I have? When?

00:26.485 --> 00:28.869
Uh, let's see. It was...

00:28.871 --> 00:29.853
all the time.

00:29.855 --> 00:32.289
Really?

00:32.290 --> 00:33.907
You and Marshall
drove back to school...

00:33.909 --> 00:35.642
<i>"500 Miles" played on a loop.</i>

00:35.644 --> 00:37.127
<i>You took a back road,</i>
<i>ran out of gas,</i>

00:37.129 --> 00:39.612
<i>got stuck in a snowstorm,</i>
<i>spooned to stay warm--</i>

00:39.614 --> 00:40.997
<i>at least that's your story--</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:43.166
<i>and at the end of it,</i>
<i>you were best friends.</i>

00:43.168 --> 00:46.469
Okay. Okay, that's fine,
because guess what.

00:46.471 --> 00:47.888
That wasn't even the worst
snowstorm ever.

00:47.890 --> 00:49.456
It was 2008...

00:49.458 --> 00:50.891
<i>- Barney and I...</i>
<i>- Took over the bar,</i>

00:50.893 --> 00:53.059
<i>met the Arizona Tech</i>
<i>marching band-- "Go Hens!"--</i>

00:53.061 --> 00:54.394
<i>and they played</i>
<i>"Auld Lang Syne" when Marshall</i>

00:54.396 --> 00:56.229
<i>picked up Lily at the airport.</i>

00:56.231 --> 00:59.099
Okay. Have I told you about
the time that Marshall...

00:59.101 --> 01:01.518
<i>Tried to put Christmas lights</i>
<i>on Lily's grandparents' house</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.303
<i>and the little ragamuffin from</i>
<i>next door left him stranded</i>

01:03.305 --> 01:04.671
<i>on the roof?</i>

01:04.673 --> 01:06.006
Did Lily tell you that one?

01:06.008 --> 01:07.407
Yeah.

01:07.409 --> 01:10.110
Lily used the word "ragamuffin."

01:12.830 --> 01:14.297
So I've told you
all my stories.

01:14.299 --> 01:16.333
I'm afraid so,

01:16.335 --> 01:19.169
I have plenty of stories
that you don't know yet.

01:19.171 --> 01:21.454
Like the one where my
college roommates and I

01:21.456 --> 01:22.655
went to this male strip club...

01:22.657 --> 01:24.507
And your friend Dongnose
got smacked on the nose

01:24.509 --> 01:25.792
with a dong?

01:25.794 --> 01:26.743
I know that one.

01:26.745 --> 01:29.679
Okay.

01:29.681 --> 01:31.715
What about the story
that explains how...

01:31.717 --> 01:33.350
Dongnose got her
nickname "Dongnose"

01:33.352 --> 01:35.752
and that it had nothing to do
with the dong-smacking incident?

01:35.754 --> 01:37.103
Heard it, loved it,

01:37.105 --> 01:40.140
called it the greatest
coincidence of the 21st century.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.342
Wow.

01:42.344 --> 01:45.145
You know every one
of my stories.

01:45.147 --> 01:48.281
And you know every one of mine.

01:48.283 --> 01:50.617
I guess it's official.

01:50.619 --> 01:52.185
We're an old married couple.

01:54.455 --> 01:56.489
Nice!
We did it!

02:13.102 --> 02:14.518
Hi.
Hi.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.555
Here for a romantic weekend
away from the kids.

02:17.557 --> 02:19.857
It's a good thing there's no
guests on either side of you,

02:19.859 --> 02:22.059
'cause those bedsprings
are gonna squeak like mice

02:22.061 --> 02:24.361
in a cheese factory.
Am I right?

02:24.363 --> 02:26.447
Just don't break any
of the lamps like your friends

02:26.449 --> 02:28.649
Barney and Robin, okay?
That's not how the lamp broke.

02:28.651 --> 02:30.734
Of course not. All right,
you have fun, you two.

02:31.937 --> 02:33.370
Uh,

02:33.372 --> 02:34.605
what lamp is this?

02:34.607 --> 02:36.540
The lamp Robin broke
the day of the wedding.

02:37.042 --> 02:38.959
Oh, my God.

02:38.961 --> 02:40.110
You don't know this one.

02:40.629 --> 02:42.112
Oh... man.

02:42.114 --> 02:43.747
This is a good one.

02:43.749 --> 02:45.299
I mean, it's got everything.

02:45.301 --> 02:47.635
Intrigue, betrayal, lamps.

02:47.637 --> 02:50.821
It is a ripping yarn,
so buckle your seatbelt.

02:50.823 --> 02:52.423
Just tell the story.
Okay.

02:52.425 --> 02:54.508
Here goes.

02:55.277 --> 02:57.811
Robin broke a lamp.

03:00.131 --> 03:01.649
Okay, this has to stop.

03:01.651 --> 03:04.101
Come on, we're
just having fun.

03:04.103 --> 03:06.803
It has been
a long weekend.

03:06.805 --> 03:08.022
This is how I relax.

03:08.024 --> 03:10.357
Really?

03:10.359 --> 03:11.775
<i>This</i> is how you relax?

03:11.777 --> 03:14.612
By not getting a single shot
past me the entire morning?

03:14.614 --> 03:17.281
You suck, Scherbatsky,
you shoot like my grandma.

03:17.283 --> 03:19.750
Okay, Scherbatsky,
you just poked the dragon.

03:19.752 --> 03:21.168
Here comes the bride.

03:21.170 --> 03:22.986
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
okay. How about

03:22.988 --> 03:26.874
we switch to an activity that's
more suited to somebody who's,

03:26.876 --> 03:29.543
you know, ,
getting married today?

03:29.545 --> 03:32.563
Oh. We gonna go
chug some Labatts?

03:32.565 --> 03:36.450
I was thinking we could chug
some memories instead.

03:36.452 --> 03:39.286
"Barney & Robin:
Lovers Forever

03:39.288 --> 03:40.521
"and Ever
and Ever:

03:40.523 --> 03:42.556
A Love Story."

03:42.558 --> 03:44.892
Sounds cheesy. I'm gonna go barf
forever and ever and ever.

03:44.894 --> 03:46.443
See you, hosers.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.114
It's not cheesy.

03:53.336 --> 03:54.818
See?

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:05.080 --> 04:07.698
Uh, can you tell me
the name of the guest

04:07.700 --> 04:09.249
staying in room nine?

04:09.251 --> 04:10.751
I'm sorry.

04:10.753 --> 04:13.003
That would violate
hotel privacy policy.

04:14.255 --> 04:18.309
Well, maybe my old friend
Mr. Lincoln...

04:18.310 --> 04:21.345
can emancipate that information.

04:23.815 --> 04:25.766
I'm so sorry, I wasn't clear.

04:25.768 --> 04:29.553
I <i>can't</i> violate
our hotel privacy policy.

04:30.822 --> 04:32.356
For five dollars.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.879
Something with
a two on it is fine.

04:38.881 --> 04:41.081
But those are super rare and
the one I have is kind of lucky.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.616
Just give me a 20, Mr. Mosby.

04:50.408 --> 04:53.477
That room belongs
to a Ms. Susan Tupp.

04:53.479 --> 04:55.796
Oh, boy.

04:58.917 --> 05:01.435
God, you're gorgeous.

05:01.437 --> 05:05.272
Oh, I can't wait
to be inside you.

05:05.274 --> 05:08.592
Barney. Get out here,
this is your wedding day.

05:08.594 --> 05:11.061
Wha...

05:11.063 --> 05:12.696
Where is she?
Who?

05:12.698 --> 05:15.482
Look, I just grossly overpaid
for some information

05:15.484 --> 05:17.151
about this room,
so I know it's accurate.

05:17.153 --> 05:19.787
This room belongs
to Susan Tupp.

05:19.789 --> 05:21.038
Who?

05:21.040 --> 05:22.539
Susan Tupp.

05:22.541 --> 05:23.607
Who?

05:23.609 --> 05:26.243
Sue...

05:26.245 --> 05:27.661
Tupp.

05:27.663 --> 05:28.729
Suit up.

05:28.731 --> 05:29.880
I'm <i>trying</i> to.

05:29.882 --> 05:32.049
I need you to help me

05:32.051 --> 05:34.418
pick the suit I'm gonna wear
when I walk down the aisle.

05:34.420 --> 05:35.619
Okay,

05:35.621 --> 05:38.722
Robin walks down the aisle,
you wait at the end of it.

05:38.724 --> 05:41.959
Okay, then the suit
I'll be wearing

05:41.961 --> 05:45.329
when they all stand as I enter the chapel.
That's also her.

05:45.331 --> 05:47.731
Really? Man, the fellas
sure do get boned

05:47.733 --> 05:49.850
on the whole wedding thing, don't they?
Okay.

05:49.852 --> 05:51.985
All right, well, let's,
let's pick you a suit.

05:51.987 --> 05:53.270
What are... what are
the top contenders?

05:53.272 --> 05:56.190
Well, after careful
consideration,

05:56.192 --> 05:58.475
I have narrowed it down to

05:58.477 --> 06:00.577
these ones...

06:00.579 --> 06:01.912
and these ones...

06:01.914 --> 06:03.831
and the other ones in this room

06:03.833 --> 06:06.166
and all the ones
in the adjoining room.

06:06.168 --> 06:07.707
So you've narrowed it down
to all your suits.

06:07.732 --> 06:08.870
Yeah, we're screwed.

06:08.871 --> 06:10.987
And this is a picture
of the restaurant

06:10.989 --> 06:14.091
where you and Barney
had your first date.

06:14.093 --> 06:16.593
And now you're getting married.

06:16.595 --> 06:20.330
Mm.

06:20.332 --> 06:22.165
from the meal you and Barney ate

06:22.167 --> 06:24.802
at that restaurant
on your first date.

06:24.804 --> 06:27.638
And now you're getting married.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.039
Can we look at this later?

06:29.041 --> 06:31.592
Later? There is no later.

06:31.594 --> 06:32.843
Robin,

06:32.845 --> 06:35.229
this is a day
you only get to do once.

06:35.231 --> 06:38.449
You need to appreciate
the importance of it right now.

06:38.451 --> 06:40.951
Oh, my God.

06:40.953 --> 06:45.456
How did I only
just now realize this?

06:45.458 --> 06:48.208
Dude, this hotel has
<i>The Wedding Bride 2</i>

06:48.210 --> 06:49.309
on pay-per-view.

06:49.311 --> 06:51.028
Score.

06:51.030 --> 06:53.213
This is the best
day of my life!

06:56.569 --> 06:59.392
I mean, I know Robin's
not the girliest girl,

06:59.393 --> 07:01.359
but you'd think
on her wedding day,

07:01.361 --> 07:03.695
she'd be at least
a little sentimental.

07:03.697 --> 07:05.447
Everyone deals with getting
married differently.

07:05.449 --> 07:07.649
I got what I thought was
the worst haircut ever.

07:07.651 --> 07:10.335
Till I fixed it with the
actual worst haircut ever.

07:10.337 --> 07:12.537
Which led to the worst
wedding photos ever.

07:12.539 --> 07:15.957
But at least you had
a wedding day freak-out.

07:15.959 --> 07:17.409
Baby, don't worry.
Any minute now,

07:17.411 --> 07:19.577
Robin's gonna get smacked
in the face with her own

07:19.579 --> 07:21.713
"holy crap, this
is my wedding" moment,

07:21.715 --> 07:24.466
and then she's gonna wedding out
all over the place. I promise.

07:24.468 --> 07:26.751
But you can't force it,
it has to just happen.

07:26.753 --> 07:29.971
Mm, I don't know. I mean,
she bailed on my scrapbook

07:29.973 --> 07:31.973
when she found out
<i>The Wedding Bride 2</i>

07:31.975 --> 07:32.987
is on pay-per-view.

07:33.012 --> 07:34.601
<i>The Wedding Bride 2</i>
is on pay-per-view?!

07:36.679 --> 07:37.762
<i>I'm sorry, did...</i>

07:37.764 --> 07:39.264
did I hear you guys
talking about

07:39.266 --> 07:40.465
<i>The Wedding Bride?</i>

07:40.467 --> 07:41.850
Oh, God.
The movie or the...

07:41.852 --> 07:43.668
smash Broadway musical?

07:43.670 --> 07:47.405
Smash? Oh, oh, oh,
I-I guess a show's a smash now

07:47.407 --> 07:49.774
if it closes
after only 96 weeks.

07:51.026 --> 07:52.911
So my husband's
ex-fiancé's husband

07:52.913 --> 07:54.863
wrote the screenplay
for <i>The Wedding Bride.</i>

07:54.865 --> 07:58.450
"Jed Mosley"
was based on Ted.

07:58.452 --> 08:01.186
Okay, Jed was not based on me...

08:01.188 --> 08:02.270
Hey!

08:02.272 --> 08:04.089
That is not a toy,
you ragamuffin.

08:04.091 --> 08:08.910
That is an authentic flail
I won at the Renaissance fair.

08:08.912 --> 08:10.111
...entirely.

08:10.963 --> 08:13.715
But, regardless, there's...

08:13.717 --> 08:15.500
there's still some
lingering pain there and...

08:15.502 --> 08:16.935
Well, as you can imagine,

08:16.937 --> 08:19.003
my friends promised me
that they'd never watch it.

08:19.005 --> 08:20.772
Wow.

08:20.774 --> 08:22.507
Those are some good friends.

08:22.509 --> 08:24.793
Oh, they're the best.

08:25.478 --> 08:28.029
Oh, oh, whoa!

08:28.031 --> 08:29.814
My wiener!

08:29.816 --> 08:32.784
I can't believe Jed made us
promise not to watch this.

08:32.785 --> 08:34.018
Wait, you mean Ted.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.804
Whatever. Same guy.

08:37.655 --> 08:40.041
See, I would have expected you
to have an extra-special suit

08:40.043 --> 08:41.409
tailor-made
just for this occasion.

08:41.410 --> 08:42.794
Oh, I did.

08:42.796 --> 08:45.463
I had my boy Timmy G make
the perfect wedding suit.

08:45.465 --> 08:46.748
You ever heard of "bespoke"?

08:46.750 --> 08:48.533
This suit was
be-freaking-screamed.

08:48.535 --> 08:51.035
But then I tried it on this
morning and it was uncomfortable

08:51.037 --> 08:53.538
and itchy and completely wrong.
It was like a suit made

08:53.540 --> 08:55.340
for someone
with terrible posture,

08:55.342 --> 08:58.209
no taste and limited funds.

08:58.211 --> 08:59.644
Here, you take it.

08:59.646 --> 09:01.146
The only
question is,

09:01.148 --> 09:03.114
which of these
other suits do I pick?

09:03.116 --> 09:05.016
There are so many great
ones to choose from.

09:05.018 --> 09:06.184
Uh,

09:06.186 --> 09:07.218
how about this one?

09:07.220 --> 09:09.687
Yes. Yes, that's the one.

09:09.689 --> 09:12.607
Oh, hey, quick question: is it
weird to get married in a suit

09:12.609 --> 09:15.393
that you may have worn while
banging a female rodeo clown?

09:17.229 --> 09:18.530
I know what you're wondering.

09:18.532 --> 09:20.765
Yes, the carpet
matched the drapes.

09:20.767 --> 09:23.034
Of course that's weird.
Every part of that is weird.

09:23.036 --> 09:24.068
Mm.

09:24.070 --> 09:25.420
Uh, what about this suit?

09:25.422 --> 09:27.505
Huh?

09:27.507 --> 09:30.191
Let's just say I stuffed
a lot of bunnies in that suit.

09:30.193 --> 09:31.993
Ugh, Barney, do you have
to phrase it that way?

09:31.995 --> 09:35.213
Actual bunnies, Ted.
This is my magic suit.

09:35.215 --> 09:36.881
Get your mind out
of the gutter.

09:36.883 --> 09:40.385
Though, I did once wear it
to the Playboy holiday party

09:40.387 --> 09:42.587
and, uh...

09:42.589 --> 09:45.690
Let's just say I stuffed a lot
of Bunnies in that suit.

09:47.726 --> 09:48.926
Uh...

09:48.928 --> 09:50.361
How about this one?
Oh, man,

09:50.363 --> 09:52.981
I went crazy on an escort
in that one.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.189
Barney, come on.

09:54.214 --> 09:56.833
A <i>Ford</i> Escort, Ted,
I did it on a car.

09:56.870 --> 09:59.537
With a woman who I then
may or may not have paid.

09:59.539 --> 10:01.039
Yeah, that one's out, too.

10:02.408 --> 10:05.393
Okay, so your wedding's
in a few hours.

10:05.395 --> 10:07.328
Kind of strange
to spend those hours

10:07.330 --> 10:09.047
watching a terrible movie,
right?

10:09.049 --> 10:12.000
Terrible? Lily,
this movie is a revelation.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.951
I can't believe that Ted
wouldn't let us see it.

10:13.953 --> 10:16.754
Yeah. Why was he hanging
so much beef on this movie?

10:16.756 --> 10:19.057
Just 'cause there's a character
based on him?

10:19.059 --> 10:22.060
Of course. I'll make
all weddings illegal.

10:22.062 --> 10:24.062
Then Stella can never
be a wedding bride.

10:25.232 --> 10:26.531
Ooh,

10:26.533 --> 10:29.150
No-can-I-do's-ville, baby doll.

10:29.152 --> 10:31.469
It's like,
"Relax, Ted,

10:31.471 --> 10:34.272
it's no big deal.
You should be flattered."

10:34.274 --> 10:36.357
And now to celebrate with
that piece of chocolate cake

10:36.359 --> 10:37.825
I've been saving.

10:37.827 --> 10:38.960
What?!

10:38.962 --> 10:40.478
Who ate my cake?!

10:42.281 --> 10:44.649
Uh, what cake?

10:44.651 --> 10:47.118
Narshall!

10:48.520 --> 10:50.471
Narshall?

10:51.390 --> 10:53.491
Narshall. How dare they?

10:53.493 --> 10:54.325
That is
insulting

10:54.327 --> 10:55.677
and ridiculous

10:55.679 --> 10:57.262
and I am nothing
like that character.

10:57.264 --> 10:59.163
I'm gonna sue everyone involved
with this film.

10:59.165 --> 11:02.634
So, you're-you're gonna sue
them on the grounds that

11:02.636 --> 11:05.570
nothing like that cake thing
has ever happened?

11:12.162 --> 11:13.978
If Ted didn't want me
to eat that cake,

11:13.980 --> 11:15.597
he should have put a note on it.

11:21.570 --> 11:24.155
Oh, hi, Grandma.
Robin, sweetheart.

11:24.157 --> 11:25.957
I wanted you
to have this.

11:25.959 --> 11:29.210
It's me and your grandpa
on our wedding day.

11:29.212 --> 11:30.712
Aw, that's so sweet.

11:30.714 --> 11:31.929
See my bouquet?

11:31.931 --> 11:33.881
Those wildflowers--

11:33.883 --> 11:36.250
they were supposed
to be hydrangeas,

11:36.252 --> 11:38.336
but there was a mix-up
at the florist's.

11:38.338 --> 11:40.388
I was so upset.

11:40.390 --> 11:42.924
Your grandpa went
behind the church

11:42.926 --> 11:45.176
and picked
those wildflowers

11:45.178 --> 11:46.978
for me. And now

11:46.980 --> 11:48.980
he's buried...
Behind the very same church,

11:48.982 --> 11:50.915
surrounded
by the very same wildflowers.

11:50.917 --> 11:53.217
Okay, Grandma,
watching a movie. Got to go.

11:53.919 --> 11:55.236
Every single holiday,

11:55.238 --> 11:56.554
that same dumb story.

11:56.556 --> 11:59.440
Sorry, Grandma, not as touching
as you think it is.

11:59.442 --> 12:01.659
At the very same church.

12:01.661 --> 12:03.060
Now, I want to see

12:03.062 --> 12:06.931
if Jed can get his wiener
unstuck from that thermos.

12:06.933 --> 12:09.617
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

12:09.619 --> 12:11.285
Uh, I'm sorry.
Did you just

12:11.287 --> 12:13.516
turn off the bride's TV
on her wedding day?

12:13.541 --> 12:13.956
Oh!

12:13.957 --> 12:16.073
Oh! Is this your wedding day?

12:16.075 --> 12:18.042
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell
because you're acting

12:18.044 --> 12:21.596
like it's any other
Sunday morning, and it's not.

12:21.598 --> 12:23.848
Lily, if you're waiting for me
to suddenly turn

12:23.850 --> 12:26.134
into th-th-the Wedding Bride,
you just give up.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.852
That's just not me.
Fine.

12:27.854 --> 12:31.105
Maybe we should all just act
like this wedding's no big deal.

12:31.107 --> 12:34.859
Maybe I don't even feel like
wearing my bridesmaid's dress.

12:34.861 --> 12:37.545
Great. It-It's just a wedding.
Who cares what people wear?

12:37.547 --> 12:38.730
Say yes to the suit!

12:38.732 --> 12:41.616
I can't! I can't.

12:41.618 --> 12:44.369
Great. Because I actually
brought a different dress

12:44.371 --> 12:45.703
that I'd like to wear.

12:45.705 --> 12:46.571
Fine.

12:46.573 --> 12:47.905
Oh, no.

12:47.907 --> 12:50.491
Maybe I'll go put it on
right now.

12:50.493 --> 12:51.993
Go right ahead.
What?

12:51.995 --> 12:53.094
I'm so sorry.

12:53.096 --> 12:54.111
What, why?

12:54.113 --> 12:56.581
I know this story, too.

12:56.583 --> 12:57.268
Really?

12:57.293 --> 13:00.118
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Robin and Lily get
in a big fight

13:00.119 --> 13:02.837
and then, a few minutes later,
there's a knock at the door.

13:04.390 --> 13:06.507
Hello.

13:11.344 --> 13:12.936
I've told you
this one before.

13:12.961 --> 13:14.370
A few times.

13:14.371 --> 13:16.354
I'm just...

13:16.356 --> 13:19.874
a boring old man
who won't stop spinning yarns.

13:19.876 --> 13:22.894
Oh, hey. I love your yarns.

13:22.896 --> 13:25.780
I hope you never stop
spinning them.

13:26.648 --> 13:28.850
But...

13:28.852 --> 13:31.769
You're the love of my life,
Pooh Bear.

13:31.771 --> 13:33.955
I just worry about you.

13:33.957 --> 13:39.860
I don't want you to be the guy
who lives in his stories.

13:40.579 --> 13:43.664
Life only moves forward.

13:46.301 --> 13:48.302
So what happens next?

13:48.304 --> 13:50.521
With Lily and the wedding dress,
I mean.

13:50.523 --> 13:53.474
Well... she brought the dress

13:53.476 --> 13:56.060
so that she and Marshall could
get new wedding photos taken.

13:56.062 --> 13:59.614
Because in yet <i>another</i> story
that I know...

13:59.616 --> 14:02.216
No!

14:02.218 --> 14:05.153
What kind of space would I have
in my brain for other things

14:05.155 --> 14:06.988
if I didn't know all this?

14:07.740 --> 14:09.741
Eh, probably just state birds

14:09.743 --> 14:10.942
or some crap.

14:10.944 --> 14:12.894
So, uh,

14:12.896 --> 14:15.446
Lily wanted to borrow
Robin's photographer.

14:15.448 --> 14:18.399
That shouldn't be a problem.
Shouldn't be

14:18.401 --> 14:21.085
a problem, Robin? Of course
it should be a problem.

14:21.087 --> 14:22.503
This is your wedding.

14:22.505 --> 14:25.273
You can't let somebody borrow
your photographer.

14:25.275 --> 14:26.758
Don't worry.
She's not serious, Robin.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.260
I didn't even bring the suit
that I wore to our wedding.

14:29.262 --> 14:30.411
Yes, you did.

14:30.413 --> 14:31.262
It's in our room.

14:31.264 --> 14:32.464
Go put it on.
We're doing this.

14:32.465 --> 14:35.183
And, Robin,
since you don't seem to care,

14:35.185 --> 14:37.852
I think I'll be wearing this
to the ceremony.

14:37.854 --> 14:39.137
Fine!
Fine!

14:39.139 --> 14:41.773
Fine. There's a very simple
solution here.

14:41.775 --> 14:43.724
We might as well just face it.

14:45.695 --> 14:48.429
U.S. Marines have to get married
in uniform, so...

14:48.431 --> 14:50.198
I'll just go enlist.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.099
Dude,

14:52.101 --> 14:54.051
we can enlist together!
That's the dream!

14:54.053 --> 14:54.587
That's not the...

14:54.612 --> 14:56.636
I wonder if they let you
pick bunkmates. I hope they do.

14:56.637 --> 14:59.374
Although I might want to request
a single. You'll make friends.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.708
Look, enough of this.

15:00.710 --> 15:03.461
Tim made you this amazing suit.

15:03.463 --> 15:04.745
Put it on.

15:07.916 --> 15:10.051
This feels weird.

15:10.053 --> 15:11.369
That's because it's new.

15:11.371 --> 15:13.137
It's a suit that's never
been worn before,

15:13.139 --> 15:15.423
a suit you never dreamed
you'd wear.

15:15.425 --> 15:18.943
All of this suit's memories
are still ahead of it.

15:18.945 --> 15:20.611
Look,
picture it, huh?

15:20.613 --> 15:22.647
The ceremony.

15:22.649 --> 15:25.933
When everyone stands up for me?
They do that for her.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.402
They should.

15:28.404 --> 15:30.138
She's gonna
look amazing.

15:30.140 --> 15:31.506
You'd better
believe it.

15:31.508 --> 15:34.325
She walks
down the aisle,

15:34.327 --> 15:36.310
you say your vows,

15:36.312 --> 15:38.812
you go
to the reception,

15:38.814 --> 15:40.814
you have
your first dance.

15:40.816 --> 15:43.835
And before you know it,
just like magic,

15:43.837 --> 15:46.204
you realize...

15:46.206 --> 15:48.256
it's a perfect fit.

15:50.342 --> 15:52.326
You're right, Ted.

15:52.328 --> 15:54.495
This is the one.

15:55.881 --> 15:57.381
Thanks.

15:59.801 --> 16:01.452
So...

16:01.454 --> 16:04.055
belts.

16:07.726 --> 16:09.093
Hey, Lil. Nice dress.

16:09.095 --> 16:11.028
You two were made
for each other.

16:11.030 --> 16:13.681
Like, does no one care
that I'm wearing this dress?

16:13.683 --> 16:15.149
I care.

16:15.151 --> 16:16.951
Okay. Now you're good.

16:16.953 --> 16:18.569
Okay, look,

16:18.571 --> 16:21.656
I know this is your
wedding, but this is

16:21.658 --> 16:23.541
a big moment
for all of us.

16:23.543 --> 16:26.043
This may be the last time
we're all hanging out together

16:26.045 --> 16:28.062
for who knows how long.

16:28.064 --> 16:29.080
I mean, tomorrow
morning,

16:29.082 --> 16:30.381
Ted's leaving
for Chicag...

16:30.383 --> 16:33.885
Oh, boy.
Lily.

16:33.887 --> 16:36.254
Wait, you already know.

16:37.022 --> 16:38.523
You already know.

16:38.525 --> 16:40.341
You're married to
Lily, which means...

16:40.343 --> 16:42.159
She pocket-texted me
while you were telling her.

16:42.161 --> 16:44.178
So...

16:44.180 --> 16:47.047
everybody knows I'm moving
to Chicago tomorrow.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.734
Lily's right.

16:49.736 --> 16:52.954
We don't know the next time
that we'll all be together.

16:52.956 --> 16:55.273
<i>And then I think</i>
<i>it hit all of us.</i>

16:55.275 --> 16:57.325
<i>We didn't know the next time</i>
<i>we'd be together.</i>

16:57.327 --> 17:01.045
<i>This was it.</i>

17:01.047 --> 17:02.163
And it's funny.

17:02.165 --> 17:03.247
In a moment like that,

17:03.249 --> 17:04.231
when what's really happening

17:04.233 --> 17:06.083
is too intense to deal with,

17:06.085 --> 17:08.202
sometimes it's best...

17:09.771 --> 17:12.740
To leave it unspoken

17:12.742 --> 17:16.127
and just enjoy
each other's company instead.

17:17.628 --> 17:20.131
You know, I've been wanting
to see this movie.

17:20.133 --> 17:22.516
Yes, movie time.

17:22.518 --> 17:23.968
So it's not bad luck for the...

17:23.970 --> 17:26.542
bride to see the groom
in his wedding suit?

17:26.568 --> 17:27.021
No,

17:27.022 --> 17:28.839
I think it's fine. Nice tie.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.726
Thanks. There was a cornflower
blue one I almost went with.

17:31.728 --> 17:32.977
Oh. Um,

17:32.979 --> 17:34.812
that would've brought out
your eyes.

17:36.565 --> 17:38.265
You brought more than one tie,
right?

17:38.267 --> 17:40.334
I was trying to pack light.

17:40.336 --> 17:42.570
Hey, you know what, maybe the, uh,
groomsmen should go get some food.

17:42.572 --> 17:44.405
I don't want Ted to have
to sit through this movie.

17:44.407 --> 17:46.240
Ah. I appreciate that, Narshall.

17:46.242 --> 17:47.224
Really?

17:47.226 --> 17:50.044
Aw, damn it.
Sorry, I saw it on a plane.

17:50.046 --> 17:51.542
What, so this is gonna be,
like, a thing now?

17:51.567 --> 17:51.997
Yeah,

17:51.998 --> 17:54.949
it's gonna be a thing now,
Narshall. Right?

17:54.951 --> 17:56.550
Narshall.
 Dude,

17:56.552 --> 17:58.169
settle down, Swarley.

17:58.171 --> 17:59.503
Yeah.

17:59.505 --> 18:01.872
Yeah, Swarlize Theron,
take it easy.

18:01.874 --> 18:05.459
Man, this was supposed
to be my special day.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.482
Oh. Hey, we survived the storm!

18:11.484 --> 18:15.569
Oh, Narshall,
did you do that?

18:15.571 --> 18:17.571
Nope. Wasn't me.

18:17.573 --> 18:19.824
Well, then who was it?

18:23.663 --> 18:25.446
A gorilla! Gorilla!

18:25.448 --> 18:26.614
So that

18:26.616 --> 18:28.148
really happened to Ted?

18:28.150 --> 18:30.334
That is exactly
what went down.

18:30.336 --> 18:32.019
Chapter and verse.

18:32.021 --> 18:33.788
Uh-oh. Out of ice.

18:33.790 --> 18:36.490
I'll get it.
Oh, no. Got it. Sit down.

18:36.492 --> 18:38.158
Plus, the, uh, vending machine's
got a loose coil.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.627
I'm gonna try
to hip check my way

18:39.629 --> 18:41.212
into some free
Tropical Skittles.

18:44.550 --> 18:47.284
Your sister's not
like most brides, is she?

18:47.286 --> 18:50.504
She's a Scherbatsky.
She's not gonna lose her Timbits

18:50.506 --> 18:52.289
just 'cause she's getting
married.

18:53.859 --> 18:56.394
I guess some people
just never have that

18:56.396 --> 19:00.331
"holy crap,
this is my wedding" moment.

19:08.323 --> 19:09.640
Mom?

19:17.833 --> 19:20.200
<i>That's the story.</i>

19:20.202 --> 19:22.386
Right down
to the surprise ending.

19:22.388 --> 19:24.371
Is that really such a surprise?

19:24.373 --> 19:25.890
I mean, come on.

19:25.892 --> 19:27.374
Yeah, of course she showed up.

19:27.376 --> 19:30.544
What mother is gonna miss
her daughter's wedding?

19:36.234 --> 19:38.218
Oh, hey.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.605
No. Come on.

19:41.607 --> 19:43.858
It's okay. I'm fine.

19:43.860 --> 19:46.210
I'm okay.

19:49.165 --> 19:53.400
Did Barney really wear
a scuba suit into the bar?

19:53.402 --> 19:55.286
I've told you that story
a million times.

19:55.288 --> 19:57.171
Yeah, but where did Barney get
the scuba suit?

19:57.173 --> 20:00.074
He stole it.

20:00.076 --> 20:00.941
What?

20:00.943 --> 20:02.293
Yeah.

20:02.295 --> 20:03.677
I can't believe
I forgot that.

20:03.679 --> 20:05.880
He... walked right
into a sporting goods store,

20:05.882 --> 20:08.783
tried on a scuba suit,
and walked right out the door.

20:08.785 --> 20:11.352
Walked all the way home
in it, like, 20 blocks.

20:12.605 --> 20:13.854
Guy in a scuba suit,

20:13.856 --> 20:16.273
just walking down Broadway.
Ah.

20:16.275 --> 20:17.858
He should be in prison.

20:17.860 --> 20:20.644
Well, yeah, for lots of reasons.

20:20.646 --> 20:22.446
You know, the thief
of the group is Lily.

20:22.448 --> 20:24.315
Yes. Oh, my God. Lily...
No. She stole my heart.

20:24.317 --> 20:25.451
No, n-no, I'm telling you,
Lily, from like, uh...
