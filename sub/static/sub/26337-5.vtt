16:09.170 --> 16:10.540
of S and P and some butter.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.009
You want to make sure
you get that good sear

16:12.009 --> 16:14.046
and then bring it back so
you're not overcooking anything.

16:14.046 --> 16:15.850
Something I really like to do
with my food is babysit.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.152
I like to‐‐

16:17.152 --> 16:18.622
How much you get?
12 bucks an hour for that?

16:18.622 --> 16:20.392
Yeah. No, sometimes.
It depends on where you're at.

16:20.392 --> 16:22.564
I would never leave
my children alone

16:22.564 --> 16:24.634
with Trevor‐‐absolutely not.

16:24.634 --> 16:26.905
I like the combination of
tomatoes and arugula‐‐classic.

16:26.905 --> 16:29.043
Right? Job well done.
I think it's great.

16:29.043 --> 16:30.980
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐Thank you, Chef.

16:30.980 --> 16:33.619
Right. Both take your dishes
back in line.

16:33.619 --> 16:36.692
I want this win bad.
I can taste it.

16:36.692 --> 16:39.631
Like, I need it.
I need to get out of here.

16:39.631 --> 16:42.436
Does the point go to Trevor
and the Red Team to even it,

16:42.436 --> 16:46.244
or does the point go to T
with the victory?

16:46.244 --> 16:50.318
Bottom of the ninth, two outs,
down by one, man on first,

16:50.318 --> 16:52.724
and here's the pitch.
It's a swing...

16:52.724 --> 16:54.528
I think I have to go with
the Blue Team with T.

16:54.528 --> 16:56.698
Yes!

16:56.698 --> 16:58.434
‐Yes!
‐And a [bleep] miss, bro.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.830
Good luck, guys. Keep going.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.205
Ladies, all of you
are gonna be traveling

17:17.205 --> 17:22.951
to the top of a skyscraper...
100 stories above the ground.

17:22.951 --> 17:25.388
All of your courage
will be tested

17:25.388 --> 17:27.627
as you walk a narrow plank

17:27.627 --> 17:29.531
from the top of the building.

17:29.531 --> 17:34.841
If you survive that, you'll
fight the zombie apocalypse.

17:34.841 --> 17:37.279
‐What?
‐I'm sending you all

<i>ARIEL: Zombies? Count me in.</i>

17:47.199 --> 17:50.105

17:53.411 --> 17:55.281

17:55.281 --> 17:58.989

‐Red Team, I'm expecting,

any minute now,

18:00.458 --> 18:06.437
a giant, humungous dumpster
brimming with manure.

18:06.437 --> 18:08.074
Since we've been open
in this competition,

18:08.074 --> 18:11.347
we've been saving
all of our waste,

18:11.347 --> 18:12.617

18:12.617 --> 18:15.188

18:18.796 --> 18:21.133
‐I'm wonderful, Chef.
‐Yeah? I can tell.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.739

18:41.875 --> 18:45.649
‐Bye, boys.
‐This some stinky‐ass [bleep].

18:45.649 --> 18:50.693
Ugh! Gross!

19:00.378 --> 19:03.084

not only like B. O.,

Oh, my God, no. No.

20:18.234 --> 20:21.307
I know.

20:21.307 --> 20:25.749
My heart was racing for a solid
30 minutes after that.

20:25.749 --> 20:27.352
You're like, "Oh, no."

20:27.352 --> 20:28.622
How was that? Too real?

20:28.622 --> 20:29.557
Too real.

20:29.557 --> 20:31.561
It was way too real.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.170
Motto, like right back at home
in the farm, huh?

20:36.170 --> 20:40.078
You're right, baby.
[bleep] brings back memories.

20:40.078 --> 20:41.815
Growing up, it's like
we got a cane field.

20:41.815 --> 20:43.618
Moved so many loads of dirt.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.656
Nothing in life
comes easy, dude.

20:45.656 --> 20:47.425
Nope. If it did,
we wouldn't be here, right?

20:47.425 --> 20:49.664
You didn't have that silver
spoon growing up, did you?

20:49.664 --> 20:52.235
Nope. Grew up in the country.

20:52.235 --> 20:54.574
I've been through way
worse [bleep] than this,

20:54.574 --> 20:56.544
<i>and I started picturing</i>
<i>my grandfather.</i>

20:56.544 --> 20:59.316
He wouldn't have let me
slack off on a load back then,

20:59.316 --> 21:01.253
so I'm not slacking off now.

21:01.253 --> 21:03.892

we got, dude.

21:03.892 --> 21:05.228

<i>Hard work is the reason</i>

21:06.531 --> 21:08.200

21:10.639 --> 21:12.643
Ah, I got juice
right in the face.

21:12.643 --> 21:15.048
Manure. It's like we're down
on the farm.

21:15.048 --> 21:17.152
That's what's gross.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.755
So why a ski resort?

21:18.755 --> 21:22.128
It was a bigger vision
for our hospitality group,

21:22.128 --> 21:23.799
which would be all food
and beverage,

21:23.799 --> 21:25.903
concessions, hotels...

21:25.903 --> 21:28.107
What do you guys
do in the offseason?

21:28.107 --> 21:31.013
We have a water park.
It's a zip line park.

21:31.013 --> 21:33.852
Scuba diving park, wakeboarding.

21:33.852 --> 21:35.756

an empire, and all of a sudden,

you put on the brakes
and come out here.

21:37.158 --> 21:39.262

30:34.900 --> 30:36.435

You've got to think
a little bit, young man.

30:37.939 --> 30:39.341
‐Yes, Chef.
‐It's just too casual for me

30:39.341 --> 30:40.978
‐‐not sharp enough up there.

30:40.978 --> 30:43.082
You may be a good cook, but
you're not sharp enough for me.

30:43.082 --> 30:45.053
This is a new system
working with new guys,

30:45.053 --> 30:47.191
and that communication
definitely wasn't there,

30:47.191 --> 30:49.529
but I know I'm way
better than that.

30:49.529 --> 30:50.898
I know I'm way better than that.

30:50.898 --> 30:53.971
‐Garnish up, Scotley?
‐Yeah. Already went.

30:53.971 --> 30:57.044
So, away now, two lobster,
one lamb, one duck.

30:57.044 --> 30:59.716
Yes, Chef. Guys,
Ten minutes out on lamb.

30:59.716 --> 31:01.753
Just keep it in the oven
to finish getting that crust,

31:01.753 --> 31:03.289
but I'm nervous about it.

31:03.289 --> 31:06.295
Okay, she's nervous about it,
so let's give it the time.

31:06.295 --> 31:08.567
Roe, give her one
extra minute, please.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.070
What's the extra minute for?

31:10.070 --> 31:12.241
Chef, the lamb is running
a little behind.

31:12.241 --> 31:15.581
By the way, T, did she tell
you one minute for the lamb,

31:15.581 --> 31:17.084
or was that you telling her?

31:17.084 --> 31:19.154
No, Chef, she was telling me
she's a little nervous.

31:19.154 --> 31:20.791
I was a little nervous
about the lamb.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.729
You need to start cooking
your own [bleep] food.

31:22.729 --> 31:23.864
Yes. Yes, Chef.

31:23.864 --> 31:25.033
Yeah?
It's just so strange for me.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.670
Yeah. Absolutely.

31:26.670 --> 31:28.039
You need to cook
with confidence.

31:28.039 --> 31:29.709
That's the whole thing.

31:29.709 --> 31:31.312
How strange.

31:31.312 --> 31:34.986
If she doesn't start trusting
that natural instinct as a chef,

31:34.986 --> 31:37.959
I can see it being a problem
for the Blue Team in the future.

31:39.763 --> 31:41.065
Blue Team.

31:42.735 --> 31:46.175
Look. It's perfectly cooked.

31:46.175 --> 31:47.679

‐It's absolutely perfect.
‐Yes, Chef.

Do me a favor.
I'll finish this.

33:45.614 --> 33:47.985
[bleep] off to the storeroom
and sort your differences

33:47.985 --> 33:50.824
out in [bleep] private.

33:53.095 --> 33:55.568
I'm [bleep] garnish.
I can't do the pass no more.

33:55.568 --> 33:56.803
Okay.

33:56.803 --> 33:58.005
Y'all can't expect me
to do the pass

33:58.005 --> 33:59.542
if I'm cooking [bleep] garnish.

33:59.542 --> 34:01.980
[bleep] kind of word is that,
Scotley? You "can't."

34:01.980 --> 34:04.451
You're supposed to be a chef,
aren't you? That's your job.

34:04.451 --> 34:06.656
No, somebody
do the [bleep] pass.

34:06.656 --> 34:07.959
Who's gonna work
with him, then?

34:07.959 --> 34:09.394
‐I am.
‐You're watching the pass.

34:09.394 --> 34:11.332
We need all [bleep]
all day long.

34:11.332 --> 34:12.635
Let's do it. Come on.

34:12.635 --> 34:14.037
<i>Is this the Red Team</i>
<i>that I know?</i>

34:14.037 --> 34:16.442
No, it's not. Is it over?
No, it's not.

34:16.442 --> 34:18.479
Was it over when the Germans
bombed Pearl Harbor?

34:18.479 --> 34:21.118
No, and it's not over yet.
Come on.

34:21.118 --> 34:22.454
Can I go halibut, Wellington?

34:22.454 --> 34:23.924
Halibut's up. Right behind.

34:23.924 --> 34:25.995
Chef, halibut's here.

34:25.995 --> 34:28.065
Wellington, sauce.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.134
I'm ready to go Wellington,
yeah?

34:29.134 --> 34:29.902
Garnish is gone.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.205
Right now.

34:31.205 --> 34:33.510
Right behind
with Wellington, Chef.

34:35.446 --> 34:39.722
Terrible.
Oh, boy, have they given up.

34:42.528 --> 34:45.166
Hey, put your finger in there.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.239
‐Yes, Chef.
‐Just put your finger in there.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.644
Just identify how [bleep]
ice cold it is.

34:50.644 --> 34:51.846
Ah, [bleep] off.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.754
How pathetic.

34:55.754 --> 34:57.424
Not even a boiling [bleep] toss.

34:57.424 --> 35:00.396
When you can't be‐‐
all of you, enough's enough.

35:00.396 --> 35:01.900
I've taken [bleep] all night.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.872
Every [bleep] table's
been a battle, and I'm done.

35:04.872 --> 35:06.810
All of you, try and do
something as a team.

35:06.810 --> 35:09.649
[bleep] off out of there
and have a great discussion

35:09.649 --> 35:11.251
about two individuals

35:11.251 --> 35:13.489
that you want to get rid of.
Get out!

35:14.726 --> 35:16.529
Sorry, Chef.

35:18.065 --> 35:19.969
Cold sauce. My bad.

35:19.969 --> 35:22.340
Got to love it.

35:22.340 --> 35:24.044
GORDON:
Last table, Blue Team, yes?

35:24.044 --> 35:25.446
I'm about to walk garnish.

35:25.446 --> 35:26.716
Walking two chicken,
two duck, guys.

35:26.716 --> 35:28.620
Beautiful. Let's go.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.490
Duck, beautifully cooked.
Crispy skin.

35:30.490 --> 35:32.895
New York strip, nicely cooked.
Pork, nicely cooked.

35:32.895 --> 35:34.665
‐Yeah, Blue Team.
‐Go, go, go.

35:34.665 --> 35:38.673
‐Oh, my God.
‐This is so tropical.

35:38.673 --> 35:40.243
It's delicious.

35:40.243 --> 35:42.113
‐Worth the wait.
‐That's it.

35:46.455 --> 35:48.425
Gizzy.

35:51.699 --> 35:53.269
When you cook like that,

35:53.269 --> 35:55.406
and everything
is absolutely on point,

35:55.406 --> 35:56.609
why are you holding back?

35:56.609 --> 35:59.014
I just wasn't thinking.

35:59.014 --> 36:00.483
I'm looking for a leader.

36:00.483 --> 36:03.222
Yes, you can cook,
but you better find your voice.

36:03.222 --> 36:05.092
It's self‐doubt.
That's all it is.

36:07.497 --> 36:10.236
And I think that's what sucks,
is that other people can be loud

36:10.236 --> 36:13.677
and confident and [bleep]
suck at this,

36:13.677 --> 36:15.246
and at least they have a voice.

36:15.246 --> 36:17.016
‐Help me to help you.
‐Yes, Chef.

36:17.016 --> 36:18.452
‐Got it?
‐Yes, Chef.

36:18.452 --> 36:20.591
Breathe. It's good.
You're good. Just breathe, okay?

36:20.591 --> 36:21.893
He would not be on your ass

36:21.893 --> 36:23.495
if he didn't think there
was more inside of you,

36:23.495 --> 36:24.765
I promise you.
Trust me.

36:24.765 --> 36:27.003
He was on my ass
the way he is on you.

36:27.003 --> 36:30.142
They're hard on me because
they know that I can do this.

36:30.142 --> 36:32.615
I feel like they know
it more than I do sometimes.

36:32.615 --> 36:34.417
You gonna find your voice?
Yeah?

36:34.417 --> 36:35.988
‐Yes, Chef.
‐Okay. Come on. Good job.

36:35.988 --> 36:37.323
Thank you.

36:39.962 --> 36:41.599
Leading up to getting
kicked out of the kitchen,

36:41.599 --> 36:43.937
the most problems
was on the fish station.

36:43.937 --> 36:45.540
Yeah.

36:45.540 --> 36:48.145
I had two salmon come back,
but I didn't know where I was,

36:48.145 --> 36:49.715
so that's the problem we have.

36:49.715 --> 36:52.788
After entrees start coming in,
there's no way.

36:52.788 --> 36:55.059
There is a way. I did it.
That's how you do that station.

36:55.059 --> 36:56.094
‐Okay.
‐In my mind,

36:56.094 --> 36:57.430
Scotley should go home.

36:57.430 --> 36:58.867
I went down because
he couldn't figure out

36:58.867 --> 37:02.206
how to communicate
what you're supposed to do.

37:02.206 --> 37:04.612
I know I [bleep] up, bro.
You know what I mean?

37:04.612 --> 37:06.616
Put it to a vote.

37:06.616 --> 37:11.291
I personally have to go Kevin
and Scotley.

37:11.291 --> 37:12.594
I want Scotley and Kev,
you know?

37:12.594 --> 37:14.164
They're not on their stations.

37:14.164 --> 37:16.970
People put my name up 'cause
I had two things come back.

37:16.970 --> 37:19.642
Yeah, but what about the lack
of leadership in anybody else?

37:19.642 --> 37:21.111
Chris, go ahead.
Who's your two?

37:21.111 --> 37:22.347
I would say Scotley
and Bret.

37:24.417 --> 37:27.190
Who wants a soft
finish to the service?

37:27.190 --> 37:28.827
I'm gonna go y'all two.

37:28.827 --> 37:31.198
Bret, you send out
the cold sauce.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.737
I don't even know
what to say right now.

37:33.737 --> 37:36.441
I'm baffled.
[bleep] sauce.

37:36.441 --> 37:39.147
I'm not going home
because of a cold sauce.

37:39.147 --> 37:41.318
Yo, so had there not been
mistakes in dinner service,

37:41.318 --> 37:42.921
cold sauce would have got us
kicked out, right?

37:42.921 --> 37:44.124
I'm just thinking. Right?

37:44.124 --> 37:45.359
We wouldn't
have been kicked out.

37:45.359 --> 37:46.696
No. We wouldn't
have been kicked out.

37:46.696 --> 37:48.165
‐Right.
‐Because I think me going up

37:48.165 --> 37:51.038
for elimination on a cold sauce
behalf is [bleep].

37:51.038 --> 37:52.240
To be honest with you.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.810
And every Wellington
was perfect?

37:53.810 --> 37:58.653
‐They weren't all perfect.
‐Did that ruin dinner service?

37:58.653 --> 37:59.889
That was one of many things.

37:59.889 --> 38:00.957
Okay, what was
the other thing?

38:00.957 --> 38:02.427
‐We had problems.
‐Okay.

38:02.427 --> 38:04.130
What were the other problems,
Motto? Spit it out.

38:04.130 --> 38:06.602
Dude, I've been telling you
what's on my [bleep] mind.

38:06.602 --> 38:08.706
There's a lot of big barking
and no bite, Bret.

38:08.706 --> 38:12.213
If you want to talk the talk,
like, walk the [bleep].

38:12.213 --> 38:15.352
I don't deserve to go home
because of a cold [bleep] sauce.

38:17.825 --> 38:19.060
That's for damn sure.

38:19.060 --> 38:20.931
[bleep] that.

38:33.455 --> 38:35.927
<i>NARRATOR: After the ladies</i>
<i>of the newly formed Blue Team</i>

38:35.927 --> 38:38.198
<i>won the dinner service,</i>
<i>the men of the Red Team</i>

38:38.198 --> 38:41.271
<i>must nominate two chefs</i>
<i>for elimination.</i>

38:41.271 --> 38:44.745
Red Team,
have you reached a decision?

38:44.745 --> 38:46.214
ALL: Yes, Chef.

38:46.214 --> 38:49.187
Trev, Red Team's first
nomination and why, please?

38:49.187 --> 38:52.594
First nomination for the Red
Team is Scotley, Chef.

38:52.594 --> 38:54.932
Garnish was one of the problems
that we had this evening,

38:54.932 --> 38:56.702
with timing and communication.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.773
Red Team's second nomination.

38:58.773 --> 39:00.442
Second nomination was...

39:02.346 --> 39:04.284
Kevin.

39:06.856 --> 39:09.060
Kevin. Why?

39:09.060 --> 39:10.095
The salmons that came back.

39:10.095 --> 39:11.364
Seemed like that's

39:11.364 --> 39:13.035
when everything started
to break down.

39:14.772 --> 39:17.443
Scotley, Kevin,
step forward, please.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.484
Kevin, second time in a row.

39:21.484 --> 39:23.255
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:23.255 --> 39:24.959
I got fight in me, Chef.
You know that.

39:24.959 --> 39:26.562
I'm not always yelling
and screaming,

39:26.562 --> 39:28.866
but I am a very
confident person.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.336
I communicated very well.

39:30.336 --> 39:32.206
You know, I need to kick
a little rust off,

39:32.206 --> 39:33.776
and this is definitely
a wakeup call, Chef.

39:33.776 --> 39:36.414
Scotley, why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:36.414 --> 39:38.720
I'm a good chef,
I'm determined to win.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.557
I'm not here to lay down.

39:40.557 --> 39:42.628
Yes, I could have
communicated better,

39:42.628 --> 39:44.698
but I didn't go down hard

39:44.698 --> 39:46.802
like how the fish station
went down tonight.

39:46.802 --> 39:48.740
The fish station
didn't go down hard.

39:48.740 --> 39:50.376
I had two [bleep] things,
you know?

39:50.376 --> 39:51.712
You didn't give me
definite times.

39:51.712 --> 39:53.816
One minute it's eight minutes,
then going back,

39:53.816 --> 39:55.720
"Oh, I need eight more minutes."
Like, come on.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.791
Garnish drives the ship.
Everybody knows that.

39:57.791 --> 39:59.127
Everyone's always known that.

39:59.127 --> 40:00.764
You are the one
that communicates.

40:00.764 --> 40:02.366
You can't say,
"I can't do it."

40:02.366 --> 40:05.406
The [bleep]?
You gonna give up?

40:05.406 --> 40:07.544
Chef, I got so much fire
in me, you know,

40:07.544 --> 40:08.579
I'm not ready to go home.

40:08.579 --> 40:10.015
You know, I step up and say,

40:10.015 --> 40:12.153
"Yeah, I've messed
the [bleep] up tonight, Chef,"

40:12.153 --> 40:15.627
but you know what? It's not over
for me, and I know that.

40:15.627 --> 40:17.597
This is a very
difficult decision.

40:17.597 --> 40:21.004
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

40:21.004 --> 40:23.241
<i>(dramatic music)</i>

40:24.578 --> 40:25.947
Kevin.

40:29.153 --> 40:31.257
Give me your jacket.

40:33.428 --> 40:36.602
<i>(mellow music)</i>

40:36.602 --> 40:38.238
I'm not feeling the desire.

40:38.238 --> 40:40.543
I mean, you've got success
outside this competition,

40:40.543 --> 40:43.549
and you are nowhere near
as hungry now

40:43.549 --> 40:46.154
as you were last time
you graced this floor.

40:46.154 --> 40:47.657
I wish you nothing but success.

40:47.657 --> 40:49.026
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you.

40:49.026 --> 40:50.630
Thank you for the opportunity.
Appreciate it.

40:50.630 --> 40:51.665
Thanks for coming back.

40:51.665 --> 40:52.968
‐Anytime.
‐Good luck.

40:52.968 --> 40:54.938
Peace out.

<i>Eight long years</i>
<i>I've been chewing on this.</i>

<i>I didn't have that fire.</i>

41:06.562 --> 41:08.633
I'm gonna give my kids
a hug and a kiss,

41:08.633 --> 41:10.904
and I'm going skiing.

41:10.904 --> 41:13.241
Scotley, back in line.

41:13.241 --> 41:16.247
I just want to make
one thing very clear:

41:16.247 --> 41:21.659
do not ever underestimate the
importance of being passionate.

41:21.659 --> 41:24.965
When you give up,
I'm gonna give up on you.

41:24.965 --> 41:25.767
Understood?

41:25.767 --> 41:26.635
ALL: Yes, Chef.

41:26.635 --> 41:29.006
