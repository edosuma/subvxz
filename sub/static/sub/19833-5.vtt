<i>Iam Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:03.297 --> 00:07.134
<i>Defeated at Ethandun,
Earl Guthrum was baptized</i>

00:07.259 --> 00:10.179
<i>and became King Aethelstan
of East Anglia,</i>

00:10.304 --> 00:15.642
<i>while in</i> Wessex <i>Aethelwold still sees
himself as the true heir to the throne.</i>

00:15.767 --> 00:17.561
I see it as a king would see it.

00:17.686 --> 00:19.730
<i>Yet King Alfred has other plans.</i>

00:19.855 --> 00:21.148
I'm to be married?

00:21.273 --> 00:23.775
A pennanent bond
between Wessex and Mercia.

00:23.901 --> 00:26.528
Which one of you is Aethelred?

00:26.653 --> 00:29.364
<i>Alfred forced me to renew my allegiance.</i>

00:29.489 --> 00:32.951
<i>He sent me to kill the Northmen
brothers, Erik and Sigefrid.</i>

00:33.118 --> 00:34.286
(GRUNTING)

00:34.411 --> 00:37.289
<i>After taking Sigefridk hand,
I banished them.</i>

00:37.414 --> 00:41.043
You will take one ship and you will
leave Northumbria. You will not return.

00:41.210 --> 00:42.377
I swear.

00:42.502 --> 00:44.338
<i>And at last in Northumbria,</i>

00:44.463 --> 00:47.925
<i>I took my revenge against Kjartan
and his son, Sven,</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:50.802
<i>freeing my enslaved sister, Thyra.</i>

00:50.928 --> 00:52.221
Let me help you.

00:52.346 --> 00:56.892
<i>Having defeated the Danes,
I married my love, Gisela,</i>

00:57.059 --> 00:59.645
<i>and now all seems quiet.</i>

00:59.770 --> 01:02.356
<i>But for a warrior
there can never be peace.</i>

01:02.481 --> 01:04.566
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

01:24.002 --> 01:25.170
We're here.

01:26.129 --> 01:29.549
Ground her ahead. Be ready.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.574
- SIHTRIC: She says she loves me.
- (MAN LAUGHS)

01:57.202 --> 01:59.204
- I swear. She says she loves me.
- She would.

01:59.329 --> 02:00.998
Sihtric, she's a whore.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.500
No. She's past that.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.335
What she loves is your silver.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.045
Is that the name of his cock?

02:07.170 --> 02:08.547
(LAUGHS)

02:09.339 --> 02:10.382
I wish to marry her.

02:10.507 --> 02:14.011
I wish you to kill Danes
and survive the night.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.138
We're the only chance
the villagers have.

02:16.263 --> 02:17.848

If you wish to live, boy,
take your hand away from your sword.

03:14.279 --> 03:16.406
UHTRED: There will be
no more than 30 raiders.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.202
We hide and we wait.

03:21.370 --> 03:23.455
We attack on my command, not before.

03:24.456 --> 03:27.376
You all heard the lord. We find cover.

03:28.835 --> 03:30.587

MAN: Elgin!

03:47.729 --> 03:49.314
Elgin, get UP!

03:51.608 --> 03:53.276
Help rob the prisoners.

03:53.402 --> 03:54.736
Keep them quiet!

03:59.449 --> 04:00.450
Elgin!

- Now!

(YELLS)

04:57.799 --> 04:59.301
What's your name?

05:04.556 --> 05:06.308
Her name is Aethelflaed, lord.

05:06.433 --> 05:07.893
You're her mother?

05:08.018 --> 05:09.769
No, lord.

05:19.154 --> 05:20.864
The king, Alfred...

05:21.948 --> 05:24.326
He has a daughter named Aethelflaed.

05:24.993 --> 05:27.370
She's strong and brave.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.624
You will need to be the same.

05:36.421 --> 05:39.216
Go back to your village.
Take care of your dead.

05:42.177 --> 05:43.261
(MAN GROANS)

05:43.428 --> 05:47.974
Finan. Hang three of the dead
from the trees, visible from the river.

05:48.099 --> 05:49.768
Lord.

05:51.061 --> 05:53.230
Take back what belongs to you.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.190
You're safe now.

05:57.275 --> 06:02.405
You will go back to your rats' nest
and tell anyone who cares to listen,

06:02.531 --> 06:06.076
"Beyond Lundene
the River Temes belongs to Alfred.

06:08.203 --> 06:11.081
And it's guarded
by Uhtred of Bebbanburg."

07:20.358 --> 07:22.902
Now, there's a welcome sight.

07:23.028 --> 07:24.821
My wife and my boy.

07:24.946 --> 07:26.615
Whoa!

07:26.740 --> 07:28.825
I think we might be
feeding you too much.

07:28.950 --> 07:31.369
Don't forget your daughter.
She's here too.

07:33.788 --> 07:36.583
- It went well?
- It did. Not a scratch.

07:37.667 --> 07:38.710
You have a visitor.

07:41.129 --> 07:42.964
He has been here all night.

07:51.222 --> 07:52.682
Aethelwold.

07:52.807 --> 07:54.726
How much of my ale have you drunk?

07:56.019 --> 07:57.979
Not a cup.

07:58.104 --> 08:01.524
Not a drop of ale has passed my lips
for ten days or more.

08:01.650 --> 08:02.901
You've been ill?

08:03.026 --> 08:06.321
Not ill, but sober,

08:06.529 --> 08:08.239
which, as you know, is unlike me.

08:09.366 --> 08:12.494
But it is important
that you accept that I am sober.

08:13.578 --> 08:14.871
(GROANS)

08:16.998 --> 08:20.585
Say what you're here to say.
You've waited long enough.

08:25.965 --> 08:27.384
The dead speak.

08:28.343 --> 08:32.389
I have seen it, heard it.
And the dead speak.

08:32.597 --> 08:33.597
The dead?

08:33.932 --> 08:35.140
A corpse.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.437
I saw him rise from his grave and speak.

08:39.604 --> 08:41.313
And what did this corpse say?

08:41.438 --> 08:44.526
What he said concerns us both... us all.
Hence my visit.

08:44.651 --> 08:47.362
And what I tell you are his words,
not mine, you understand.

08:47.529 --> 08:48.613
What did he say?

08:51.116 --> 08:52.367
That I should be king.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.245
No, believe me, it is true.

08:56.204 --> 08:57.914
He said that I should be king of Wessex

08:58.039 --> 09:01.042
and that you...
you should be a king too.

09:01.167 --> 09:05.046
He said that you, Uhtred,
will be crowned king of Mercia.

09:08.174 --> 09:09.968
Bjorn heard it
through the three spinners.

09:10.093 --> 09:11.428
Bjorn?

09:12.429 --> 09:14.013
That is his name.

09:19.769 --> 09:21.271
He is a Dane?

09:21.396 --> 09:24.274
A dead Dane, yes. Therefore a good Dane.

09:28.194 --> 09:30.029
We are royalty, you and I.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.240
I have done my utmost to serve Alfred

09:32.365 --> 09:34.492
but with no reward, no respo...
Where are you going?

09:34.659 --> 09:37.036
To wash the blood off my hands
and then to bed.

09:37.162 --> 09:38.455
Do you not believe me?

09:38.621 --> 09:40.331
Where did you see this corpse?

09:42.125 --> 09:43.835
Mercia. Beyond Watling Street.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.879
You crossed into Daneland?

09:46.004 --> 09:49.966
I went to the part of Mercia
that Alfred gifted to the Danes, yes.

09:50.091 --> 09:52.510
You happened to wander
across Watling Street?

09:52.677 --> 09:55.847
I was sent for! I was invited!
And the same will happen to you.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.355
I know what I saw.

10:09.277 --> 10:10.320
You will be a queen.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.239
I may not wish to be a queen.

10:19.537 --> 10:22.749
When Bjorn is ready to speak,
there will be a messenger.

10:26.085 --> 10:27.337
Tell me.

10:28.338 --> 10:30.006
Do you wish Alfred harm?

10:30.131 --> 10:32.509
No. No, of course not.

10:34.636 --> 10:37.138
I mean, I wish him dead
but I would not harm him.

10:44.854 --> 10:46.147
I know what I saw.

10:50.151 --> 10:52.320
I will not outstay my welcome.

10:55.156 --> 10:57.158
Thank you for your kindness.

11:13.591 --> 11:16.052
You are sworn to Alfred.

11:16.177 --> 11:19.556
To become king of Mercia
you would need to break that oath.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.391
If that is my fate.

11:22.308 --> 11:24.310
Then you believe he speaks the truth?

11:24.435 --> 11:26.396
No, I do not.

11:28.857 --> 11:31.150
But I know he's not telling lies.

11:34.779 --> 11:36.447
The truth is another matter.

11:38.324 --> 11:40.910
We do not want an enemy such as Alfred.

11:41.035 --> 11:43.830
And Alfred will not want
an enemy like me.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.084
It appears to be good progress, lord.

11:48.209 --> 11:51.212
The people of Coccham
seem to be in good spirits.

11:51.337 --> 11:53.089
It would appear so.

11:54.299 --> 11:55.592
We shall see.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.219
MAN: Lord King.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.807
Open the gates!

12:12.317 --> 12:14.319
- Finan.
- What?

12:17.614 --> 12:19.449
Lord King!

12:19.574 --> 12:21.910
- Welcome to Coccham.
- Finan.

12:22.035 --> 12:24.329
Lord Uhtred is at the fortress,
the burh.

12:24.454 --> 12:26.664
If you fetch him, Finan,
we'll be waiting in the hall.

12:26.831 --> 12:28.249
I will, lord.

12:31.669 --> 12:34.005
The man must have a priest
for each day of the year.

12:34.881 --> 12:36.382
MAN: God be with you.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.437
Lord, we are crossing into Wessex.

12:49.562 --> 12:52.565
This stretch of river
is protected by Lord Uhtred.

12:52.690 --> 12:55.568
- You say you have trade there?
- I do, lord.

12:57.904 --> 13:01.616
Lord, please,
I cannot risk losing my ship.

13:01.783 --> 13:03.785
You will keep your ship.

13:07.205 --> 13:09.248
It's easy enough to say it.

13:24.305 --> 13:26.099
It is a pagan's hall.

13:27.684 --> 13:30.561
Lord, you say the same
every time we visit.

13:30.728 --> 13:33.439
Uhtred is a pagan, as is his hall.

13:33.564 --> 13:36.609
I find it annoying
that he will not grow.

13:36.734 --> 13:39.612
He insists upon clinging
to these ancient beliefs.

13:39.737 --> 13:42.615
- The beliefs of our forefathers.
- Who knew no better.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.535
Lord King.

13:46.744 --> 13:49.455
- Refreshment.
- Thank you, Gisela.

13:51.666 --> 13:54.419
I, uh... I trust you are well.

13:54.544 --> 13:57.672
I am, lord, and better for your visit.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.009
- The ale is freshly brewed.
- Ah! Excellent.

14:04.095 --> 14:05.638
You are content in Wessex, I hope.

14:05.763 --> 14:07.056
I am, lord.

14:07.223 --> 14:11.060
I am well, my family are well,
and there's peace.

14:11.185 --> 14:15.273
This is all I ask.
And what of you? Are you content?

14:16.441 --> 14:20.153
My daughter is now old enough
and will soon be gifted in marriage.

14:20.278 --> 14:23.948
I am... apprehensive.

14:24.073 --> 14:26.451
- Aethelflaed is a sweet girl.
- She is.

14:26.576 --> 14:29.454
- You are fond of her suitor, lord?
- Aethelred.

14:30.747 --> 14:32.498
He serves a purpose. He is godly.

14:33.082 --> 14:37.295
GISELA: Well, we look forward to
the wedding celebrations in Winchester.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.630
And I wish her happiness.

14:39.756 --> 14:43.342
The purpose of marriage
is not to be happy, my dear.

14:43.468 --> 14:45.094
Then I am fortunate.

14:46.095 --> 14:48.389
I pray my own wife might say the same.

14:48.514 --> 14:51.350
Oh, I imagine she does, Odda,
as she so rarely sees you.

14:51.476 --> 14:53.311
(DOOR OPENS)

14:54.562 --> 14:56.939
Lord King. Lord Odda.

14:58.107 --> 14:59.525
Steapa, my friend.

15:00.401 --> 15:04.113
Uhtred, you do not deserve
such a charming wife.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.824
Oh, I can only agree, lord.

15:06.991 --> 15:09.077
I was not expecting you.
There's been no message.

15:09.202 --> 15:10.703
I'm hearing you've hanged a man.

15:13.206 --> 15:15.291
I hanged many men just lately.

15:15.416 --> 15:16.834
Raiders... Danes.

15:17.001 --> 15:19.796
And already dead, lord.

15:19.962 --> 15:23.299
I am speaking of a Saxon man,
a man of Coccham, of Wessex.

15:23.424 --> 15:25.009
That is why you are here?

15:25.134 --> 15:26.803
Amongst other concerns.

15:29.347 --> 15:32.975
That man was a thief, lord.
Sinful to the bone.

15:33.101 --> 15:35.394
You hanged him without trial.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.688
He was guilty. Three times over.

15:37.814 --> 15:39.690
It is the purpose of a trial
to determine guilt.

15:39.816 --> 15:42.110
People must witness
justice being done.

15:43.486 --> 15:45.029
Then I shall arrange a trial.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.031
It's a little bit late for that, I fear.

15:47.156 --> 15:49.826
GISELA: Has there been
a complaint, lord?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.661
There are laws, carefully written laws,

15:51.786 --> 15:54.372
and if you wish to remain an ealdorman,
you will adhere to them.

15:54.497 --> 15:58.042
You shall not impose your pagan ideals
within my kingdom.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.419
We are west of Watling Street, not east.

16:02.380 --> 16:03.339
Yes, lord.

16:03.464 --> 16:06.509
We do not cross over into Daneland,
we do not cross over into Danelaw,

16:06.634 --> 16:08.678
in mind, nor body nor spirit.

16:08.803 --> 16:10.012
No, lord.

16:12.557 --> 16:14.725
My nephew... Aethelwold.

16:14.851 --> 16:15.893
He was, uh...

16:17.603 --> 16:19.188
Well, he was seen doing just that.

16:20.314 --> 16:22.733
Leaving Wessex, crossing through Mercia
from west to east.

16:22.859 --> 16:25.153
Are you aware of this?

16:26.070 --> 16:27.071
I'm not.

16:28.489 --> 16:31.617
When Aethelwold was here, he mentioned
nothing of crossing into Daneland.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.536
Hm. What did he mention?

16:35.621 --> 16:38.124
He mentioned you, lord,
and how you took his crown.

16:38.249 --> 16:40.376
ODDA: Aethelwold is permanently idle.

16:40.501 --> 16:43.462
My advice is the same
as it has always been.

16:43.588 --> 16:45.882
You should put him on trial
and then kill him.

16:47.216 --> 16:51.179
Should the devil begin to whisper
in his ear, then I may have no choice.

17:50.529 --> 17:54.992
Besides the man you strung up,
how many of the raiders did you kill?

17:55.159 --> 17:56.786
We killed about 30 men in total.

17:57.662 --> 17:58.788
They'd sacked a village.

17:59.330 --> 18:03.000
- Which was in Mercia.
- Lord, we hear the screams at night.

18:03.167 --> 18:07.129
Mercia is weak. Its people
have no protection from the Danes.

18:07.255 --> 18:09.340
Mercia is disorganized
and that will change.

18:09.465 --> 18:11.342
There will be burhs.

18:15.429 --> 18:16.597
What is that?

18:17.139 --> 18:20.268
- That structure, there?
- It's a place for prayer, lord.

18:22.770 --> 18:24.188
A church, Uhtred?

18:24.313 --> 18:29.485
Not quite, lord. It's a shack...
with a cross attached.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.738
If it is for the purpose of prayer,
then it is a church.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.241
Lord! A ship is near.

18:36.575 --> 18:37.618
Traders.

18:38.577 --> 18:40.579
Perhaps you'd like a moment
to pray, lord?

18:42.623 --> 18:44.583
I'll need to watch the trader.

18:44.709 --> 18:45.710
Yes.

18:46.294 --> 18:48.212
Yes, I would like that.

18:58.764 --> 18:59.974
Lord!

19:01.017 --> 19:02.727
I was just thinking about you.

19:02.852 --> 19:05.813
You were in my prayers...
is what I mean.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.565
Thank you, Hild.

19:08.566 --> 19:11.068
Please continue.
Do not let me disturb your peace.

19:12.153 --> 19:15.906
Would you care to sit with me...
in peace, lord?

19:16.032 --> 19:17.992
I would, Hild. I will.

19:33.424 --> 19:39.096
May I ask...
have you found your lasting peace?

19:40.598 --> 19:42.099
I am near, lord.

19:43.351 --> 19:46.562
I feel more content here with God
than with my sword.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.690
Courage without the sword
is the more difficult path.

19:51.025 --> 19:55.279
It must in time become the only path.

19:57.615 --> 20:00.618
I pray you find your peace
sooner than I.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.621
Thank you, lord.

20:04.622 --> 20:06.457
CAPTAIN: You, stay with the ship.

20:10.586 --> 20:13.798
Godwin... I was expecting you days ago.

20:14.799 --> 20:16.258
Are you carrying the axe heads?

20:16.425 --> 20:19.303
I am, lord. Frankia made.

20:19.470 --> 20:21.305
Would split an oak tree.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.474
- How many?
- How many do you need?

20:27.228 --> 20:29.313
My man saw warriors aboard your ship.

20:32.441 --> 20:33.859
Is this true?

20:37.613 --> 20:38.906
Three men only, lord.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.283
It is a Northman.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.537
He wishes to speak with you, alone.

20:45.663 --> 20:48.457
- Can I trust this Northman?
- He says that you know him.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.877
His name is Erik.
He has a brother, Sigefrid.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.255
Finan.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.507
First sign of trouble, fire the ship.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.760
There'll be no need for fire, lord.

21:01.053 --> 21:04.765
Sihtric, fetch me
a whole bunch of torches.

21:07.143 --> 21:08.936
I like to be prepared.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.616
ERIK: Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

21:23.951 --> 21:26.829
Here you are, lost in Wessex once again.

21:26.954 --> 21:28.914
I am sworn...

21:29.039 --> 21:30.916
to King Alfred.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.545
That is why I am here.

21:35.921 --> 21:36.922
Why are you here?

21:37.047 --> 21:40.426
I'm not looking to fight. Not yet.

21:41.427 --> 21:44.305
Can you believe I'm traveling
to meet with a dead man?

21:44.430 --> 21:48.476
- You deal in sorcery now?
- It is my fate, or so I'm told.

21:49.768 --> 21:52.104
You have my word that I will
make my appointment in Mercia

21:52.313 --> 21:54.899
and then I shall return to Frankia.

21:55.024 --> 21:56.317
Sigefrid is in Frankia?

21:56.484 --> 21:57.776
He is.

21:57.902 --> 22:01.822
But not for much longer.
My brother is... restless.

22:02.698 --> 22:05.075
We have grown strong
in the years since Northumbria.

22:05.201 --> 22:08.204
We have a fleet now. 19 ships.

22:09.705 --> 22:11.707
Which you will sail to where?

22:11.832 --> 22:15.794
Oh, we have no firm plan,
other than to listen to Bjorn.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.129
The dead man.

22:17.338 --> 22:19.798
You say it without surprise, Uhtred.

22:19.924 --> 22:22.051
I think you might have
gotten wind of this ghost.

22:22.885 --> 22:26.013
He speaks the words of the three
spinners. We cannot ignore him.

22:26.555 --> 22:29.141
- We?
- You and I.

22:29.266 --> 22:32.686
After his defeat at Ethandun,
the Earl Guthrum rejected our gods

22:32.811 --> 22:34.188
and they are angry.

22:35.731 --> 22:37.358
They want revenge.

22:38.359 --> 22:40.569
I believe we have been chosen.

22:45.074 --> 22:48.452
You will receive your invitation.
You shall see for yourself, I'm sure.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.997
What if I refuse to meet
with this ghost?

22:52.122 --> 22:55.125
That is a matter
for the three spinners and the gods.

22:56.210 --> 22:59.129
And what if I believe this ghost
to be a trap?

23:00.256 --> 23:02.841
To be Sigefrid wanting to kill me?

23:02.967 --> 23:05.844
You have my word that it is not.

23:05.970 --> 23:11.308
I swear, all that we want is
Uhtred of Bebbanburg at our side.

23:12.810 --> 23:16.146
Now, am I allowed to pass
to keep my own appointment?

23:17.982 --> 23:18.983
You are.

23:21.235 --> 23:22.444
Safe journey.

23:24.029 --> 23:26.240
All the way back to Frankia.

23:26.407 --> 23:28.492
Uhtred Ragnarson.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.620
You will always have my respect.

23:36.875 --> 23:40.546
But do not forget
you were raised as a Dane.

23:44.633 --> 23:46.594
(LIVELY CHATTER)

23:52.433 --> 23:55.644
- The broth was suitable, lord?
- The broth was a delight, Gisela.

23:55.769 --> 23:56.812
As is the ale.

23:56.937 --> 23:59.815
You should moderate, Odda. You have
a ladder to climb to find your bed.

23:59.940 --> 24:03.444
- You can always be carried, lord.
- lt wouldn't be the first time.

24:03.569 --> 24:05.195
And I guarantee
it won't be the last time.

24:06.322 --> 24:09.033
Lord, you make me out to be a drunk.

24:09.158 --> 24:12.911
Though my head will be sore
in the morning, I know it.

24:13.037 --> 24:16.040
Well, then it's ale for breakfast, lord,
the only cure.

24:17.041 --> 24:18.083
(LAUGHTER)

24:20.377 --> 24:23.714
Was my nephew drunk
when he was here last?

24:26.300 --> 24:28.886
Aethelwold is often drunk, lord.

24:29.011 --> 24:31.013
But this last time
he did not touch a drop.

24:31.138 --> 24:34.683
He mentioned he had been sober for days,
which came as a surprise.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.894
- That's a miracle.
- Not quite.

24:37.019 --> 24:39.772
UHTRED: Aethelwold is not
a complete fool, lord.

24:39.897 --> 24:42.775
If he's idle, then could he not
help bring order to Mercia?

24:44.985 --> 24:46.362
He fought well at Ethandun.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.530
As he is fond of reminding people.

24:49.657 --> 24:50.866
He's as good a man as Aethelred.

24:50.991 --> 24:53.118
Uhtred, you speak of matters
you do not understand,

24:53.243 --> 24:54.870
matters that do not concern you.

24:54.995 --> 24:57.122
The safety of Wessex concerns me.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.582
I'm happy to hear you say it.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.626
Which is why
we killed the raiders, lord.

25:00.751 --> 25:02.378
Raiders who once belonged
to Earl Guthrum.

25:02.503 --> 25:03.837
His name is now King Aethelstan.

25:03.962 --> 25:06.006
That has been his name
since he became a Christian.

25:06.173 --> 25:09.218
Regardless of what he's called,
it's his men who now break the peace.

25:09.385 --> 25:11.261
- You are sure of this?
- UHTRED: lam.

25:11.428 --> 25:14.264
They gather at the mouth
of the Temes river at Beamfleot.

25:14.390 --> 25:17.142
It's true, lord.
Two hundred or more, we've seen it.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.520
UHTRED: And their number grows.

25:19.645 --> 25:22.189
If these rogues are Aethelstan's men,
then they are his worry.

25:22.314 --> 25:25.401
Until they decide
to blockade the river, lord.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.070
Then Wessex will be starved of trade.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.322
- Aethelstan shall deal with them.
- He must kill them.

25:30.447 --> 25:31.865
I believe we must kill them.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.952
ALFRED: What we must do
is hold the peace!

25:35.077 --> 25:37.287
War cannot always be the answer.

25:37.454 --> 25:41.458
Lord, forgive me but you speak of
matters you do not fully understand.

25:42.876 --> 25:47.798
These men will not listen to Aethelstan
and Aethelstan will not deal with them.

25:47.965 --> 25:48.924
For now they are rogues,

25:49.049 --> 25:51.760
but should they find a lord to serve,
then they will become an army.

25:51.885 --> 25:54.638
So answer me this. Where might
this lord come from? Do I know of him?

25:56.598 --> 25:57.850
Should I fear him?

25:59.101 --> 26:02.479
You can be sure
he will not be called Uhtred, lord,

26:02.646 --> 26:04.398
if that is your meaning.

26:08.026 --> 26:12.781
My advice, lord, is to send
ships and men to Beamfleot.

26:16.827 --> 26:19.496
We shall maintain the peace.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.635
They say it is an honor
to have the king stay,

26:33.802 --> 26:37.723
but his men and his priests have eaten
almost a winter's worth of food.

26:37.848 --> 26:41.143
Uhtred, how can you serve a man
who doesn't see your value?

26:41.268 --> 26:43.061
Oh, he sees it.

26:43.187 --> 26:45.689
His God won't allow him to embrace it.

26:45.814 --> 26:48.025
He dislikes me more by the day.

26:49.026 --> 26:51.320
Then you should ask him to release you.

26:52.529 --> 26:56.241
And we will go north,
to my brother and to Ragnar.

26:57.367 --> 27:01.205
I am content here, but we cannot
become an enemy of Alfred.

27:07.419 --> 27:09.129
HILD: Lord.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.341
Hild. You look fearsome.

27:13.217 --> 27:16.094
- I think I preferred you with a sword.
- My sword has become heavy.

27:16.220 --> 27:18.847
But you could probably
kill someone with that, though.

27:22.518 --> 27:24.311
I need to speak to you plainly.

27:26.146 --> 27:29.858
I would like to build a house,
a nunnery, here in Coccham,

27:29.983 --> 27:32.945
but with your permission
and that of the bishop, of course.

27:34.112 --> 27:35.656
The time is the right time.

27:37.825 --> 27:40.911
You have my permission. No question.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.663
Thank you.

27:42.788 --> 27:44.373
And you have my protection.

27:45.999 --> 27:49.670
Always... Abbess Hild.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.759
You will always be too good a woman
for God alone.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.094
(SHE CHUCKLES)

28:00.180 --> 28:02.140
UHTRED: Alfred will be pleased.

28:12.568 --> 28:15.362
ERIK: Stow the oars! Make her secure.

28:17.114 --> 28:18.907
- And, Haesten...
- Lord?

28:19.032 --> 28:20.576
Ensure the ships are guarded well.

28:20.701 --> 28:21.743
Yes, lord.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.837
The fortress of Beamfleot.

28:31.962 --> 28:33.714
And all the men inside.

28:34.172 --> 28:35.591
They're ours now.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.760
Even the air is rich here.

28:40.178 --> 28:42.431
Lundene is how far upriver?

28:42.556 --> 28:44.516
Half a day, with the tide.

28:45.392 --> 28:47.728
We take it at the earliest.

28:47.853 --> 28:48.979
And Uhtred.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.189
As we planned.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.794
BEOCCA: Are you looking forward
to the wedding, Father?

29:12.920 --> 29:15.964
I am. I am, Father Beocca.

29:16.089 --> 29:20.052
I enjoy a wedding
as much as the next drunkard.

29:20.177 --> 29:23.013
And how is your own lady, Father?
The Dane.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.348
Thyra?

29:24.473 --> 29:28.143
She is not my lady. She's well.

29:28.268 --> 29:30.896
She is something of a strange beauty.

29:31.063 --> 29:32.606
Yes.

29:32.773 --> 29:35.901
She's, uh... She's... Yes.

29:36.026 --> 29:39.404
I infonn God each evening
how much I miss the company of a woman.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.198
He sends me nothing.

29:41.323 --> 29:45.077
We talk, Thyra and I.

29:45.202 --> 29:46.662
She's a pleasant woman.

29:48.080 --> 29:53.168
There is no finer sight than that
of a naked woman, arms outstretched.

29:54.795 --> 29:56.463
Almost there.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.590
Lord! Lord?

29:58.715 --> 30:00.509
Beocca, come in.

30:04.137 --> 30:06.139
- Father Pyrlig.
- Good day, lord.

30:06.264 --> 30:08.976
I read of nothing
but skirmishes and raids.

30:10.185 --> 30:12.062
What kind of a place must Daneland be?

30:12.187 --> 30:14.606
- Sinful, lord.
- Without question.

30:14.731 --> 30:18.068
They aspire only to kill and fornicate.

30:18.193 --> 30:21.029
AELSWITH: Lord. Are we to wait?

30:21.196 --> 30:23.657
- For a moment.
- BEOCCA: Lady Aelswith.

30:23.824 --> 30:24.908
Lady, I beg your pardon

30:25.033 --> 30:27.911
for my somewhat colorful description
of life as a Dane.

30:29.246 --> 30:30.497
We are prepared, lord.

30:35.377 --> 30:37.838
- Father Pyrlig, I have a task for you.
- Lord.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.715
You are familiar with East Anglia,
are you not?

30:39.923 --> 30:43.135
I am, lord.
Aland of quite unremarkable beauty.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.386
You will go to King Aethelstan.

30:44.511 --> 30:47.514
He may need help
with the reading of this letter.

30:47.639 --> 30:48.640
Aethelstan.

30:48.765 --> 30:51.309
He is to deal with the rogue Danes
at Beamfleot and swiftly.

30:51.435 --> 30:53.645
- If you could emphasize swiftly.
- Emphasize swiftly.

30:53.770 --> 30:56.648
You have been allocated a guard.
They are waiting for you in the stable.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.860
- I am to leave now, lord?
- Swiftly, Father.

31:01.111 --> 31:04.740
May I say, I was somewhat looking
forward to the celebrations, lord?

31:04.948 --> 31:07.367
The whole of Winchester
shall be celebrating.

31:07.492 --> 31:09.161
Swiftly.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.622
- Yes, lord. I will gather what I need.
- Lord.

31:18.170 --> 31:20.005
You are ready?

31:23.633 --> 31:25.260
Iam.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.096
There's still
a little decorative work to be done.

31:28.221 --> 31:31.141
Now, do not touch it.
You have ink on your hands.

31:44.488 --> 31:47.991
Say what you think. Do you like it?

31:50.535 --> 31:52.370
I have not seen anything so beautiful.

31:55.373 --> 31:56.583
He does not deserve you.

31:56.708 --> 31:58.293
Did I not say the same?

31:58.418 --> 32:00.462
I hope that Aethelred says the same.

32:00.587 --> 32:04.966
Aethelred should consider himself
a very fortunate young man.

32:05.092 --> 32:07.260
And in time, you will
grow fond of him, I'm sure.

32:07.385 --> 32:08.512
I'm already fond of him.

32:08.637 --> 32:10.764
Oh, shush now. You've barely met him.

32:10.931 --> 32:13.058
The last time over a year ago.

32:13.183 --> 32:15.477
Aethelred is a good and godly man.

32:15.602 --> 32:18.230
Who is a little too fond of himself.

32:18.355 --> 32:20.273
Will Uhtred be coming to the wedding?

32:20.690 --> 32:23.735
Sadly, he will. I'm sure.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.946
I consider him to be our lucky charm.

32:26.071 --> 32:28.156
Now, now. There will be no mention
of luck or channs.

32:28.323 --> 32:31.076
- There is God's will and nothing more.
- Praise Him.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.002
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

32:42.254 --> 32:44.214
MAN: It is fertile land, lord.

32:47.509 --> 32:48.802
No greener than Mercia.

32:49.678 --> 32:53.098
Though Wessex has the advantage
of not sharing a border with the Welsh.

32:54.391 --> 32:58.812
The Welsh to the west, the Danes
to the east, and Alfred to the south.

32:58.979 --> 33:00.313
We're surrounded.

33:00.438 --> 33:02.524
I would say we're perfectly positioned,

33:02.691 --> 33:06.403
at the very middle
of Alfred's idea of an England.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.322
Pivotal.

33:09.447 --> 33:10.782
Yes, I like that.

33:14.911 --> 33:15.996
Lord?

33:16.997 --> 33:20.917
Lord! Have you made a decision yet?

33:22.752 --> 33:24.379
Have you given it thought?

33:24.504 --> 33:26.047
Given thought to what?

33:26.173 --> 33:27.757
Uhtred.

33:27.883 --> 33:31.887
Well, my request to marry, lord.
I would like to have a family.

33:34.139 --> 33:35.849
Lord, you will answer the man.

33:38.643 --> 33:41.938
I will speak with her at Winchester
and give you my decision.

33:42.939 --> 33:44.316
Thank you, lord.

33:45.609 --> 33:48.195
But you're to give her no more
of your ann-rings nor silver!

34:09.882 --> 34:11.967
If it is not the great Lord Uhtred

34:12.092 --> 34:14.971
of the small and little-known village
of Coccham.

34:15.138 --> 34:16.931
I see you're drinking again, Aethelwold.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.226
Just a cup or two, nothing more.

34:19.351 --> 34:21.353
I have news for you.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.521
You know where to find me.

34:26.775 --> 34:30.070
Before you take yourself away to an inn,
I wish to speak with you.

34:30.195 --> 34:31.987
About what?

34:32.155 --> 34:33.239
Privately.

34:42.958 --> 34:44.668
Uhtred, please.

34:44.793 --> 34:47.504
Let us not rush
to make an enemy of Alfred.

34:47.629 --> 34:49.922
And if the dead man and the gods
say differently?

34:50.130 --> 34:52.634
GISELA: They will not,
if they are truly gods.

34:53.510 --> 34:58.598
And also... this girl whom Sihtric
loves, you will not belittle her.

34:59.641 --> 35:01.393
She's an alehouse whore.

35:01.518 --> 35:03.270
GISELA: And what is Aethelflaed?

35:03.395 --> 35:04.980
What is a peace-cow if not a whore?

35:05.146 --> 35:07.232
There's a difference, clearly.

35:07.357 --> 35:11.486
She will marry and be humped by a man
she does not know and for a price.

35:11.611 --> 35:13.154
Where's the difference?

35:14.364 --> 35:17.158
- It's the way.
- She is a whore in a wedding gown.

35:18.201 --> 35:20.829
If it is the way,
then I belong to your uncle still.

35:24.624 --> 35:25.750
I will say no more.

35:26.459 --> 35:28.128
I'm pleased to hear it.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.010
Uhtred!

35:36.177 --> 35:39.306
Uhtred, as always
it begins as a joy to see you.

35:39.431 --> 35:41.308
And you, Father Beocca.

35:42.642 --> 35:45.854
- You look well.
- I am well.

35:45.979 --> 35:48.064
Oh, I would like you to meet
Father Pyrlig.

35:48.231 --> 35:50.775
Lord Uhtred.
I've heard much about you.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.153
Father Pyrlig was once
a warrior himself.

35:53.278 --> 35:54.738
Sword and spear, lord,

35:54.863 --> 35:58.325
but a man tires of sticking ironware
into the bellies of other men.

35:58.450 --> 36:01.703
I would have enjoyed a cup of ale
with you both, but I must leave you.

36:01.828 --> 36:03.413
You have the letter secure?

36:03.538 --> 36:07.876
I do, Father. I've put it
right next to my ball-bag.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.878
Lord Uhtred, it was an honor.

36:12.339 --> 36:15.717
- Unusual priest.
- Yes.

36:16.968 --> 36:18.386
Uhtred...

36:18.511 --> 36:22.307
There is a matter upon which
I find myself in need of your advice.

36:22.432 --> 36:24.225
About Thyra.

36:24.351 --> 36:27.729
Oh, as I say, she... she's...
Well, she's... delightful.

36:29.397 --> 36:30.690
But my problem is this.

36:32.942 --> 36:35.862
She, um... must leave, I feel.

36:36.529 --> 36:39.657
Um... Join you at Coccham
or return to Ragnar.

36:40.867 --> 36:42.869
- You don't want her here?
- No.

36:43.661 --> 36:45.080
Yes. I mean, no...

36:45.246 --> 36:48.124
I do want her here.
It's just that, uh...

36:48.291 --> 36:50.418
I simply cannot think.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.670
I can't work, I can't sleep.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.006
It's been like this for months.

36:56.508 --> 36:58.510
I can barely pray.

36:58.635 --> 37:00.553
And even when I do I pray,
I pray only for myself,

37:00.678 --> 37:02.013
which is wrong, very wrong.

37:02.972 --> 37:04.349
Sinful.

37:04.474 --> 37:06.142
Wrong.

37:07.102 --> 37:09.396
I didn't realize she had become
such a burden, Father.

37:09.521 --> 37:13.400
I mean, she's not a burden.
She could never be a burden.

37:14.943 --> 37:17.737
Then, Father, I'm lost.
Why must she leave?

37:17.862 --> 37:20.365
Because I cannot think
of anything but her.

37:23.326 --> 37:26.246
It is constant
and it is pathetic and hopeless,

37:26.371 --> 37:30.792
because... she is fair
and I am Beocca.

37:31.668 --> 37:34.629
A man old enough to be
her much older brother.

37:36.631 --> 37:37.966
You're smiling.

37:38.091 --> 37:39.634
No.

37:39.759 --> 37:41.428
You're laughing at me.

37:41.553 --> 37:43.513
No, Father. I swear
I'm not laughing at you.

37:43.638 --> 37:46.349
- I can see your teeth.
- I'm sharing yourjoy.

37:47.767 --> 37:48.893
There is no joy.

37:49.018 --> 37:52.313
- (DISTANT CHEERING)
- I feel I am in a purgatory of sorts.

37:53.356 --> 37:55.108
Thyra will not go to Ragnar.

37:55.275 --> 37:58.403
She's happy here in Winchester
with you.

37:58.528 --> 37:59.779
- Nonsense.
- Beocca...

38:00.780 --> 38:02.657
You are her peace, her happiness.

38:04.075 --> 38:05.660
- Marry her.
- Marry her?

38:06.870 --> 38:09.831
You should marry her, Father,
and bed her.

38:13.585 --> 38:16.045
And then give thanks to God
for giving us such a joy.

38:17.213 --> 38:19.215
Praise Him, Father.

38:19.382 --> 38:21.426
- Praise Him!
- (LAUGHS)

38:23.595 --> 38:25.555
But what if she refuses?

38:37.859 --> 38:39.027
CLAPA: ls that Aethelred?

38:39.152 --> 38:45.074
Mm... From what I know, Alfred
could not have chosen a bigger turd.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.619
I've never met the man,
but by the look of him,

38:47.744 --> 38:50.205
he was indeed
shat out the arse of a giant.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.372
(CHUCKLING)

38:51.498 --> 38:53.666
He is to be king of Mercia,
they are saying.

38:55.418 --> 38:56.920
The ealdormen of the Witan are saying.

38:57.045 --> 38:59.339
UHTRED: Lord of Mercia perhaps.

38:59.464 --> 39:03.343
Alfred would never allow
another Saxon to be called king.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.970
Nor would a certain dead man
called Bjorn.

39:07.096 --> 39:09.349
- He wishes to meet you.
- Come with me.

39:09.807 --> 39:12.644
Ow! You're pinching my skin.
You're pinching my skin.

39:15.438 --> 39:16.523
This was clean!

39:16.648 --> 39:19.400
Why are you being trusted with
my business? Who gave you this message?

39:19.526 --> 39:21.069
- A skald. A pagan skald...
- His name!

39:21.236 --> 39:23.988
Uh... Eilaf, Eilif...
Something Dane, something odd.

39:25.114 --> 39:27.617
Are you any wiser? No, you are not.

39:27.742 --> 39:29.702
I'm a messenger, nothing more.

39:31.788 --> 39:33.414
Like it or not we are bonded, you and I.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.458
- Bonded?
- Yes!

39:35.583 --> 39:38.503
Our ancestors were kings and yet
we are barely acknowledged as ealdormen.

39:38.628 --> 39:40.129
We deserve more.

39:41.464 --> 39:43.299
You especially deserve more.

39:45.885 --> 39:48.763
As for me, I have a chamber in the
palace and that is the sum of my land.

39:48.888 --> 39:52.809
He has given me nothing.
I am no longer part of the Witan even.

39:57.105 --> 40:00.024
Uhtred, I can see you are torn
but why should we stand by and watch

40:00.149 --> 40:03.903
while power and wealth is given
to the likes of Aethelred of Mercia?

40:05.446 --> 40:06.990
You are witness. You saw him just now,

40:07.156 --> 40:09.534
riding through Winchester
like a peacock, like he was king--

40:09.659 --> 40:11.578
When?

40:12.745 --> 40:14.163
When am I to meet with Bjorn?

40:15.665 --> 40:19.043
If we leave tonight, we can be back here
in two days, in time for the wedding.

40:19.168 --> 40:20.670
I am to take you there.

40:24.507 --> 40:28.553
Watch him rise from his grave
and you will know that it is all true.

40:30.513 --> 40:31.764
He will not ask again.

40:31.889 --> 40:33.182
SIHTRIC: Lord!

40:33.308 --> 40:35.476
Don't speak! Don't move!

40:39.105 --> 40:41.899
We leave as soon as
my horses are cooled and fed.

40:43.818 --> 40:45.737
The winds are blowing a change,
Lord King.

40:45.862 --> 40:46.904
(GRUNTS)

40:53.578 --> 40:55.955
You'll be glad to hear
that I've made my decision.

40:57.332 --> 40:58.666
You may marry this girl.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.044
- Lord, thank you--
- Upon completion of a task.

41:01.169 --> 41:03.630
You'll fetch Clapa, you'll go
to the stables and wait for me.

41:03.755 --> 41:05.840
Ensure the horses
are watered and fed, but ready.

41:05.965 --> 41:07.508
- Yes, lord.
- Go.

41:08.551 --> 41:10.094
And thank you, lord.

41:10.887 --> 41:12.639
We will name our first son Uhtred, lord.

41:12.805 --> 41:15.183
- No, you will not!
- No, we will not.

41:32.992 --> 41:34.369
- Thyra..
- (GASPS)

41:35.995 --> 41:38.289
Beocca...

41:38.414 --> 41:39.874
You... you gave me a fright.

41:39.999 --> 41:41.584
Forgive me.

41:42.210 --> 41:43.586
Are you coming inside?

41:46.297 --> 41:47.340
I have supper.

41:48.132 --> 41:50.510
There's something
I needed to say, Thyra.

41:50.635 --> 41:52.804
Something I needed to ask.

41:53.638 --> 41:55.807
- You should ask it--
- Marry me!

41:57.767 --> 42:00.353
I said... I said marry me.

42:02.313 --> 42:05.400
It was selfish of me to ask,
to even mention the word.

42:08.111 --> 42:10.029
But, uh...

42:10.154 --> 42:13.866
I fear you have become someone
I cannot live without.

42:13.991 --> 42:15.243
You fear?

42:16.202 --> 42:17.245
Life without you...

42:25.670 --> 42:26.671
Fear no more.

42:30.341 --> 42:31.551
I'm here.

42:33.428 --> 42:34.971
Always.

42:51.279 --> 42:52.280
Supper?

42:53.865 --> 42:54.866
Praise Him.

42:59.495 --> 43:00.955
This is it.

43:02.290 --> 43:03.875
The skald's hall.

43:04.459 --> 43:07.879
It was given to Eilaf by his lord,
for great service.

43:08.004 --> 43:10.715
Sihtric, you will go no further.

43:10.840 --> 43:13.843
Not until we are at the hall and inside.

43:13.968 --> 43:16.262
- At all times you will remain unseen.
- Yes, lord.

43:16.387 --> 43:20.600
If the dead man rises,

43:20.725 --> 43:24.520
when he returns to his grave,
you will keep watching.

43:26.230 --> 43:28.900
What if he sees me, lord?

43:29.025 --> 43:30.234
What if...

43:32.111 --> 43:33.905
What if he knows that I am near?

43:34.030 --> 43:36.407
Then you shit yourself. (CHUCKLES)

43:36.532 --> 43:39.076
You will remain unseen and keep watch.

43:39.202 --> 43:40.203
Yes, lord.

44:01.098 --> 44:03.059
There are men... warriors.

44:24.372 --> 44:26.874
We are here to see Eilaf, the skald.

44:30.336 --> 44:31.462
We have an invitation.

44:33.256 --> 44:34.423
Who leads here?

44:37.510 --> 44:39.512
- You?
- I do.

44:40.805 --> 44:42.223
I am Haesten

44:42.390 --> 44:45.935
and you... are Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

44:47.228 --> 44:50.022
You spared me at Eofervvic, lord.

44:50.147 --> 44:52.191
You're expected and welcome.

45:01.993 --> 45:04.996
(LIVELY CHATTER)

45:16.966 --> 45:18.342
Go take a piss.

45:22.430 --> 45:25.016
- Who is he?
- A thief, lord.

45:36.277 --> 45:40.406
I serve Erik, Sigefrid's brother.

45:42.158 --> 45:43.784
He sends you good wishes.

45:43.951 --> 45:45.286
Erik is not here?

45:46.954 --> 45:48.539
He is not.

45:48.664 --> 45:51.250
And if I had my way,
I would not be here.

45:52.418 --> 45:55.838
My men... are afraid.

45:55.963 --> 45:57.465
Of ghosts?

46:01.260 --> 46:03.220
It is not a sight you will forget.

46:06.432 --> 46:11.395
My lord wants you to know that by now
he will be at Beamfleot and not Frankia.

46:12.939 --> 46:14.023
With Sigefrid?

46:14.190 --> 46:17.276
With his brother... and with the fleet.

46:18.277 --> 46:19.487
He insisted you were told.

46:19.612 --> 46:21.989
And where to after Beamfleot?

46:24.617 --> 46:25.826
I can't say.

46:26.869 --> 46:29.163
But it is hoped
that you will join us there.

46:31.290 --> 46:33.459
Eilaf is resting, lord,
in preparation for tonight.

46:33.584 --> 46:36.420
You... may wish to do the same.

46:47.098 --> 46:50.184
They have a fleet. How many, I wonder.

46:50.309 --> 46:51.978
19 ships.

46:52.103 --> 46:55.231
That's more than 500 men,
plus those already there.

46:55.356 --> 46:57.066
And those who will come.

46:57.191 --> 46:58.442
Then it has started.

47:00.152 --> 47:03.114
- What?
- The end of the peace.

47:20.339 --> 47:22.383
You stand too close, girl.

47:30.599 --> 47:33.019
Do not make me speak to you again.

47:37.314 --> 47:39.233
Once the marriage is made,

47:39.358 --> 47:43.112
you should consider
making Aethelred earn his privilege.

47:43.237 --> 47:46.532
Skirmishes and raids from the Danes
must not be tolerated.

47:46.657 --> 47:48.034
Not one.

47:48.159 --> 47:50.202
It should be made
Aethelred's responsibility.

47:50.327 --> 47:55.166
And the Mercian ealdormen should be
invited to attend a Wessex Witan.

47:55.332 --> 47:57.043
For the purpose of what?

47:57.168 --> 47:59.962
For the purpose of bowing to the king

48:00.087 --> 48:02.882
and watching the lord of Mercia
do the same.

48:05.342 --> 48:09.972
I do not doubt for one moment that
Aethelred has dreamt... is dreaming...

48:10.097 --> 48:11.432
of overtaking me.

48:12.433 --> 48:14.351
It would be a simple reminder
of his position.

48:14.977 --> 48:17.021
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

48:17.146 --> 48:18.898
Excuse me, lord.

48:19.023 --> 48:20.399
Odda. Come in, join us.

48:25.613 --> 48:28.074
Lord, it is about
both something and nothing--

48:28.199 --> 48:29.241
Sit.

48:35.498 --> 48:38.209
Uhtred has left Winchester, last night.

48:38.334 --> 48:41.378
- And gone where?
- We don't know for certain.

48:42.296 --> 48:44.924
- And what of his current witch?
- His wife, dear.

48:45.049 --> 48:47.259
The Lady Gisela remains in Winchester.

48:48.677 --> 48:50.262
Well, he can't have gone far.

48:50.387 --> 48:53.182
Aethelwold is with Uhtred.

48:54.433 --> 48:57.520
- They went in which direction?
- Mercia, lord.

49:00.648 --> 49:02.316
I think it is more than nothing, Odda,

49:02.441 --> 49:05.528
and I am wholly tired
of never-ending disobedience.

49:05.653 --> 49:08.697
But it will not
ruin your appetite, lord.

49:10.741 --> 49:12.076
It will not.

49:13.119 --> 49:14.745
Put a watch on Gisela.
She must not leave

49:14.870 --> 49:17.123
until her husband has returned
and explained his absence.

49:20.709 --> 49:21.752
Father Beocca.

49:21.961 --> 49:22.962
Lord!

49:23.087 --> 49:25.548
Lord... Lady.

49:26.590 --> 49:27.633
I have news.

49:27.758 --> 49:29.176
Uhtred has returned?

49:29.301 --> 49:30.469
From where, lord?

49:30.594 --> 49:32.972
What is your news, Father Beocca?

49:34.849 --> 49:36.350
I am to be married.

49:42.731 --> 49:46.735
The once proud and brave Earl Guthrum...

49:46.902 --> 49:48.612
(MEN MUTTER)

49:48.737 --> 49:52.783
- He now calls himself a Christian!
- (MEN LAUGH)

49:53.784 --> 49:58.164
He now calls himself King Aethelstan,

49:58.289 --> 50:01.876
but he's nothing but Alfred's hound,

50:02.001 --> 50:05.129
- and he's shamed us all!
- (MEN SHOUT)

50:05.254 --> 50:09.925
He has shamed every warrior
that has gone before us!

50:11.343 --> 50:13.470
He has shamed the gods!

50:14.847 --> 50:21.145
The gods call upon every man
gathered here today to avenge them!

50:22.146 --> 50:26.358
- And avenge them we will!
- (MEN CHEER)

50:27.193 --> 50:29.403
By sunrise tomorrow,

50:29.528 --> 50:33.949
Lundene and all of its riches
shall be yours.

50:34.116 --> 50:38.078
- (MEN CHEER)
- Believe me when I tell you

50:38.204 --> 50:41.165
the gods are with us!

50:41.290 --> 50:44.251
- The gods are with us!
- (MEN CHEER)

50:46.045 --> 50:47.504
OARSMEN: Pull!

50:49.173 --> 50:50.758
Pull!

52:36.322 --> 52:40.701
Forgive me for not being awake
to greet you, lord.

52:41.493 --> 52:45.622
Bjorn has given me little rest
these recent times.

52:48.667 --> 52:50.711
We understand.

52:52.713 --> 52:56.008
The gods are wanting true men.

52:56.175 --> 53:00.471
So I thank you for being here,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

53:02.181 --> 53:06.477
After tonight... I hope to sleep.

53:17.237 --> 53:18.906
Fetch the blood.

53:23.202 --> 53:25.162
(MAN WHIMPERS)

53:25.287 --> 53:27.247
It is time.

53:53.857 --> 53:55.275
It's a Christian graveyard.

53:55.901 --> 53:57.820
HAESTEN: Yes, lord.

53:57.945 --> 54:02.741
Perhaps that is why Bjorn
cannot rest, nor pass.

54:14.086 --> 54:15.421
(MAN WHIMPERS)

54:18.841 --> 54:20.134
Please, no.

54:20.300 --> 54:22.511
Please... Please.

54:25.139 --> 54:30.644
To raise the dead, lord, we need
to send a messenger across the gulf.

54:30.769 --> 54:32.479
- He is guilty?
- Twice over.

54:32.646 --> 54:34.440
MAN: Please, I beg you, lord, please...

54:34.565 --> 54:37.317
I have a wife, I have children.
Please...

54:37.443 --> 54:38.735
What did you steal?

54:38.861 --> 54:41.572
Just a lamb, lord, for my family.

54:41.697 --> 54:44.366
- And furs.
- For my family, lord!

54:44.491 --> 54:47.411
I'm sorry but a thief twice over
deserves to die.

54:47.536 --> 54:49.997
- No! Please...
- Put it in his mouth.

54:50.122 --> 54:51.665
No, please, lord. I beg you, please.

54:51.790 --> 54:53.917
I can fight, I can work,
I can serve, lord.

54:54.042 --> 54:56.712
Please, I beg of you.
I'm on your side, lord. (SOBS)

54:56.837 --> 54:59.465
What is it? Please, no, lord.
Please, no...

55:02.301 --> 55:04.219
HAESTEN: Sh...

55:07.639 --> 55:08.807
A harp string, lord.

55:08.932 --> 55:10.893
A bridge from our world to Bjorn's.

55:11.018 --> 55:12.686
Kill him.

55:12.811 --> 55:15.355
Please, lord. Please, lord, no, please!

55:15.481 --> 55:18.775
Get the message into his mouth
and kill him!

55:18.901 --> 55:22.112
Spare me! Spare me
and I will repay you with gratitude.

55:22.237 --> 55:24.198
Please, lord... (SOBBING)

EILAF: Bjorn...

55:59.900 --> 56:01.693
You have blood.

56:03.946 --> 56:06.448
I have given you life.

56:07.866 --> 56:10.244
I have sent you a message.

56:10.410 --> 56:13.413
If it's peace that you want,

56:13.539 --> 56:17.209
you shall not have it
until we hear you speak.

57:07.301 --> 57:10.971
EILAF: Welcome, Bjorn.
This is Lord Uhtred,

57:11.138 --> 57:14.641
who has sent a good many Dane
to the place where you live.

57:14.766 --> 57:16.935
I do not live.

57:17.978 --> 57:20.564
EILAF: You have a message
for Lord Uhtred.

57:30.240 --> 57:33.577
Lord Uhtred. I see you now.

57:34.786 --> 57:38.081
The gods have had their sacrifice

57:38.248 --> 57:45.839
and the brothers have tonight begun
that which cannot be stopped.

57:45.964 --> 57:49.343
Lundene's streets are red...

57:50.761 --> 57:52.804
with Saxon blood.

57:55.182 --> 57:59.645
You... are to be king.

58:00.896 --> 58:02.689
King of Mercia.

58:02.814 --> 58:06.693
King of Saxon and Dane.

58:07.611 --> 58:11.615
King of other kings.

58:15.118 --> 58:18.538
You, Lord Uhtred.

58:24.586 --> 58:26.171
(HE FALLS)

58:30.133 --> 58:32.260
Bury him.

58:34.096 --> 58:35.222
Lord King?

58:37.224 --> 58:39.059
It is done.

59:12.342 --> 59:13.885
(GASPS)

59:23.186 --> 59:25.021
What we have just witnessed...

59:27.190 --> 59:28.442
You believe it to be true?

59:28.608 --> 59:30.485
I do.

59:32.237 --> 59:33.447
And me.

59:35.073 --> 59:37.367
It put a shiver
through your spine, no doubt.

59:40.078 --> 59:43.582
So, what now? You're sworn to Alfred.

59:43.707 --> 59:46.168
AETHELWOLD: Alfred is nothing
compared to the gods...

59:47.586 --> 59:49.463
I would suggest.

59:51.381 --> 59:56.803
Uhtred, it is our birthright
to be called kings.

59:58.221 --> 01:00:00.098
Haesten !

01:00:02.434 --> 01:00:05.103
- Lord?
- The brothers Sigefrid and Erik...

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:08.356
ls it true what Bjorn says?
They're attacking Lundene?

01:00:09.608 --> 01:00:13.111
I cannot say for certain, lord,
but that was the plan.

01:00:13.236 --> 01:00:15.697
To sail upriver and take Lundene,

01:00:15.822 --> 01:00:18.658
which would now be your city

01:00:18.825 --> 01:00:20.911
as king of Mercia.
