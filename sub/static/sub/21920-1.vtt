01:49.925 --> 01:51.631
Hail, emperor Caligula!

01:51.632 --> 01:53.881
- Hail!
- Hail!

01:53.882 --> 01:58.574
I wanted to welcome the
greatest defender of the USSR,

01:58.575 --> 02:01.174
But I wanted to know who Mr.
Neruda is,

02:01.175 --> 02:03.881
Because he fills his
mouth to speak of peace

02:03.882 --> 02:07.864
But supports the strikers
against our public force.

02:07.865 --> 02:10.339
I do not know what the
right to do with luxury

02:10.340 --> 02:15.256
Of insulting our president
in the foreign press.

02:15.257 --> 02:16.881
I'm talking with you.

02:16.882 --> 02:19.864
- I'm talking with you.
- I 'm listening, Senator.

02:19.865 --> 02:22.589
"Are you Neruda or not?"
- Certainly.

02:22.590 --> 02:26.425
I do not know, two months ago
he was called Ricardo Reyes.

02:27.675 --> 02:31.075
Why did you change your name?
Did you steal anything?

02:32.782 --> 02:34.215
Silence!

02:34.782 --> 02:37.699
"How dare you, sir?"
- It's just a question.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.256
More respect for the senator!

02:39.257 --> 02:44.549
Silence, the dignified senator
Neruda has the floor.

02:44.550 --> 02:47.507
Thank you, Mr. President
of this fucking Senate.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.506
First of all, I thank
the Russian people

02:51.507 --> 02:54.965
For having defeated fascism
and conquered world peace.

02:55.990 --> 02:59.799
Secondly, I thank
my Communist Party

02:59.800 --> 03:04.381
For always defending the rights
of the workers and the people.

03:04.382 --> 03:07.756
Rights that are
threatened at the moment,

03:07.757 --> 03:10.849
Because they are arresting
trade union leaders

03:10.850 --> 03:12.614
And members of the Communist Party.

03:12.615 --> 03:14.864
This is being done
by its president,

03:14.865 --> 03:18.340
The traitor Gonzales Videla, who
sold himself to the Northern Empire.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.339
You elected him, did not you?

03:21.340 --> 03:24.799
We all elected him,
unfortunately.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.400
All the idiots here
present elected him.

03:28.257 --> 03:29.557
Excuse.

03:33.765 --> 03:37.881
It's been three years since the
end of World War II and here,

03:37.882 --> 03:42.050
In this cheerful house, will
start a fabulous pursuit.

03:46.382 --> 03:49.806
I always thought that's how it
celebrates the Chilean left.

03:49.807 --> 03:52.090
When he is not
Complaining about something.

03:52.825 --> 03:56.131
Deep down, they're
happy, they're in love.

03:56.132 --> 03:59.590
They love to mingle with the
suffering and sweat of others.

04:02.532 --> 04:06.364
In this place neither
intellectuals nor artists,

04:06.365 --> 04:09.025
Those who traveled the
world and came back happy.

04:13.015 --> 04:16.005
The advisors, the lawyers.

04:16.007 --> 04:19.699
Every criminal gets
around people who are

04:19.700 --> 04:23.440
Who went to university to learn the
art of bureaucratic deception.

04:24.575 --> 04:25.999
Don Pablo.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.857
You're not ready yet because
you're going to get dressed.

04:28.858 --> 04:31.716
Like Lawrence of Arabia,
the desert guerrilla.

04:33.115 --> 04:34.415
And your wife.

04:35.325 --> 04:36.800
I do not understand it.

04:37.883 --> 04:41.099
She is an Argentine
aristocrat trained in Paris

04:41.100 --> 04:44.275
And ended up with that son
of a railroad worker.

04:51.265 --> 04:53.240
What then? How was I?

04:54.800 --> 04:56.200
Unrecognizable.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.083
Please silence!

05:10.425 --> 05:12.675
Silence! Thank you.

05:13.258 --> 05:17.883
We will continue the program with a
surprise from the owner of the house.

05:18.508 --> 05:22.133
With you, the poet Pablo Neruda.

05:26.350 --> 05:28.240
All eyes fixed on him.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.200
All the lids.

05:33.465 --> 05:38.799
“I can write the saddest
poem of all tonight”

05:38.800 --> 05:40.633
Many want to kiss him.

05:42.783 --> 05:44.758
They want to take it in their hands.

05:46.590 --> 05:48.315
They want to sleep in your bed.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.639
They say it smells like seaweed.

05:52.640 --> 05:57.424
"The night wind whirls
in the sky and sings...."

05:57.425 --> 06:02.050
What a shame, keep repeating
this rural school poem.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.424
Written over 20 years.

06:05.425 --> 06:11.133
"I loved her, and sometimes
she loved me too...."

06:14.533 --> 06:18.766
Women imagine that he makes
love with a rose in his mouth.

06:20.283 --> 06:22.114
And that, after kissing them,

06:22.115 --> 06:25.275
Will write love poems
inspired by them.

06:26.683 --> 06:28.499
He is the king of love.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.750
"I wanted to..."

06:43.333 --> 06:48.514
“I can write the saddest
poem of all tonight...

06:48.515 --> 06:51.090
To think I don’t have her. To
feel that I’ve lost her..."

06:52.090 --> 06:56.300
They do not know what it is to sleep
on the floor, but they are all red.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.981
"To hear the immense night,

07:01.982 --> 07:05.057
more immense without her..."

07:05.058 --> 07:07.364
If we had a Bolshevik
revolution,

07:07.365 --> 07:09.464
These would be the
first to flee.

07:09.465 --> 07:12.465
"As in the grass the dew."

07:14.590 --> 07:17.675
They say that Neruda is the most
important Communist in the world.

07:18.883 --> 07:22.674
He must firmly believe in the
union of operatives and peasants,

07:22.675 --> 07:26.550
In the dignity and historical lucidity
of the Chilean Bolshevik party.

07:27.133 --> 07:29.724
We will not drink water.

07:29.725 --> 07:31.507
These gentlemen are working.

07:31.508 --> 07:33.432
Please take this from here.

07:34.433 --> 07:35.864
Thank you.

07:35.865 --> 07:41.340
We are coming from an emergency of
the Party's political commission.

07:44.133 --> 07:45.433
Quiet!

07:46.175 --> 07:48.507
I was asked to tell you

07:48.508 --> 07:52.091
That the government is
confining our union leaders.

07:53.050 --> 07:55.858
I was asked to
inform you that...

07:58.800 --> 08:00.339
what...

08:00.340 --> 08:02.500
Let's go underground.

08:04.925 --> 08:06.225
Me too?

08:07.758 --> 08:09.058
Yes you too.

08:15.965 --> 08:18.132
I'm absolutely sure

08:18.133 --> 08:20.299
That sooner or later,

08:20.300 --> 08:22.964
Sooner than later...

08:22.965 --> 08:25.007
Silence, senators!

08:25.008 --> 08:28.549
This political process
will be properly judged

08:28.550 --> 08:33.750
And their perpetrators will
receive the name they deserve.

08:34.424 --> 08:35.725
Thank you very much.

08:38.633 --> 08:41.049
Silence in the salt, please!

08:41.049 --> 08:43.465
In Chile there will be no
Freedom of expression.

08:43.466 --> 08:45.915
We do not live free from fear.

08:45.916 --> 08:49.465
On January 6, 1948,

08:49.466 --> 08:53.756
I am persecuted for remaining faithful
to the highest human aspirations

08:53.757 --> 08:57.424
And I sat down for the
first time before a court

08:57.425 --> 09:02.256
For having denounced to America
the violation of those freedoms

09:02.257 --> 09:06.881
In the last place where
he wanted it to happen:

09:06.882 --> 09:08.882
Here in Chile.

09:11.366 --> 09:12.956
Why do they do this?

09:12.957 --> 09:15.840
Well, the Communists
hate to work.

09:16.591 --> 09:18.631
They prefer to set churches on fire.

09:18.632 --> 09:21.590
They say they feel more alive.

09:31.550 --> 09:34.715
The Chilean aristocracy
likes to show its wealth.

09:34.716 --> 09:37.206
But the poet should
not be impressed.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.174
Esteve nos sal es de Paris

09:39.175 --> 09:43.175
And this provincial imitation
makes you laugh. But he does.

09:45.341 --> 09:48.606
Alessandri was twice
President of the Republic.

09:48.607 --> 09:50.757
Now he is president of the Senate.

09:51.675 --> 09:55.457
In his office he has a key
with the word "Chile".

09:56.007 --> 09:58.550
All of us, Chileans,
are his servants.

10:03.841 --> 10:07.040
I was with the president.
He is very sad.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.631
Is it really? Because?

10:08.632 --> 10:12.715
He says that you have insulted
him with biased falsehoods.

10:12.716 --> 10:17.090
My intention is to cause the greatest
possible harm to the president.

10:17.091 --> 10:20.131
Write a book when you
leave the chain.

10:20.132 --> 10:23.049
"Carcerary Poems," or something.

10:23.050 --> 10:25.965
A lousy title, Alessandri.
Do not talk about what you do not understand.

10:25.966 --> 10:29.881
In politics, insolence
is a form of admiration.

10:29.882 --> 10:34.299
I ask you to open the prison of
Pisagua and release my comrades.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.465
Why do you ask me what
I do not want to do?

10:36.466 --> 10:38.465
I thought you did not take orders,

10:38.466 --> 10:40.965
But is now a footman of the
traitor Gonzales Videla.

10:40.966 --> 10:45.006
What language, senator!
That's why he has problems.

10:45.007 --> 10:48.924
No, I have problems
because I'm a communist.

10:48.925 --> 10:52.800
Yes, but also for
inciting riots...

10:53.491 --> 10:54.799
Trade unionists.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.149
I do not regret this.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.656
What do you regret?
To have turned bourgeois?

10:58.657 --> 11:01.049
I regret doing the
traitor's campaign.

11:01.050 --> 11:03.257
He wrote a poem for him!

11:04.632 --> 11:07.799
Now it's fun, but
during the campaign...

11:07.800 --> 11:10.465
But these traitors
have their charm too.

11:10.466 --> 11:12.006
I do not agree with that.

11:12.007 --> 11:15.965
You and your comrades
were so thirsty for power

11:15.966 --> 11:19.174
Who were deceived by a
populist of araque.

11:19.175 --> 11:21.874
What evil exists in
ambition for power?

11:21.875 --> 11:25.881
It's our turn.
We have the right to occupy La Moneda.

11:25.882 --> 11:27.465
How will you govern?

11:28.300 --> 11:31.256
With a Soviet democracy
of soldiers,

11:31.257 --> 11:33.465
Of operatives and peasants.

11:34.341 --> 11:35.965
God forbid!

11:35.966 --> 11:39.799
The palate will be stinking
with peanuts and wine.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.716
And you're going to write
laws with misspellings.

11:43.632 --> 11:44.932
Can be.

11:45.507 --> 11:48.965
But the cemeteries will not be
filled with political prisoners.

11:48.966 --> 11:50.631
Senator, please!

11:50.632 --> 11:54.631
They always think that they will
defeat communism by exiling us.

11:54.632 --> 11:58.549
Getting us in jail.
I'll give you some advice.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.800
The solution is to kill us all.
Kill us.

12:02.382 --> 12:04.590
So they solve the problem.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.715
Do not repeat that.
Some may try.

12:07.716 --> 12:09.466
Who's going to do that? You?

12:10.175 --> 12:11.675
I'll think about it.

12:13.257 --> 12:16.799
Pablo, the Supreme Court
will confirm your cassation.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.881
You need to leave the country now.

12:18.882 --> 12:21.090
Please, listen to me.

12:21.091 --> 12:24.174
If you leave the country without
a constitutional power,

12:24.175 --> 12:26.631
Your legal situation will worsen.

12:26.632 --> 12:29.174
But I'm going to
be banned anyway.

12:29.175 --> 12:31.800
Don Pablo, this is the
position of the Party.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.299
I think Pablo should get caught.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.840
Absolutely not.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.590
How am I more dangerous,
arrested or outlawed?

12:41.591 --> 12:43.381
- Stuck!
"What are you saying?"

12:43.382 --> 12:44.715
Outlaw.

12:44.716 --> 12:47.383
"Are you serious?"
- Of course.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.632
So we're going to have to run away.

12:51.050 --> 12:54.465
You can not think of Paul
as a political leader.

12:54.466 --> 12:57.299
He is a writer, his
obligation is to write.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.965
Trapped or dead, you will
not be able to do that.

12:59.966 --> 13:01.299
Who's going to kill me?

13:01.300 --> 13:03.507
Do you want to go to history, Pablo?

13:04.257 --> 13:06.590
He wants to move on to history.

13:07.782 --> 13:10.282
Say cheese! Looking...

13:13.407 --> 13:15.031
RESISTANCE

13:15.032 --> 13:17.032
- Perfect.
- You're ready.

13:19.491 --> 13:23.031
- So, what do you think?
- Pablo, give yourself.

13:23.032 --> 13:24.865
- They'll catch you.
- No.

13:24.866 --> 13:26.325
Disappear.

13:27.575 --> 13:31.715
Can be. But I will not
hide under the bed.

13:31.716 --> 13:35.200
This has to be a wild chase.

14:34.557 --> 14:36.057
This is where I come in.

14:37.532 --> 14:38.932
I have to go in.

14:40.432 --> 14:42.150
I come from the blank page.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.066
I came to get my black ink.

14:46.182 --> 14:49.399
Here enters the
policeman full of life,

14:49.400 --> 14:51.275
With his chest full of air.

14:55.749 --> 14:56.949
Over here, please.

14:56.950 --> 15:01.032
My president has a boss:
The president of the USA.

15:01.616 --> 15:05.199
When he orders the local
communists to be killed,

15:05.200 --> 15:08.065
This trained monkey must obey.

15:08.066 --> 15:11.075
- Good afternoon, Mr. President.
- Good afternoon.

15:14.366 --> 15:16.650
- This is the Chief Commissar?
- Yes sir.

15:17.366 --> 15:18.666
Much pleasure.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.031
It's my pleasure, Mr. President.

15:21.032 --> 15:23.531
The Director General, present here,

15:23.532 --> 15:26.450
You got upset because I
wanted to talk to you.

15:27.032 --> 15:29.406
I can not believe you got
upset with yourself.

15:29.407 --> 15:30.765
You got upset.

15:31.607 --> 15:34.365
If you upset or did not get
upset, what do you think?

15:34.366 --> 15:37.699
Yeah, I think she got
upset a little bit.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.575
- Do you know Neruda?
- Yes sir.

15:42.366 --> 15:44.241
Do you read poetry?

15:44.825 --> 15:46.324
Little.

15:46.325 --> 15:49.449
This country is full of
intelligent communists.

15:49.450 --> 15:51.865
They speak French and
like to build bridges.

15:51.866 --> 15:56.500
We are talking about someone
who only had shoes at age 12.

15:58.450 --> 16:01.865
In my campaign, he was
pulling out a little paper

16:01.866 --> 16:04.365
And ten thousand proletarians
were silent to hear him

16:04.366 --> 16:07.366
Recite a poetry with
that voice you have.

16:08.116 --> 16:12.075
But Chileans do not forgive the
criminals who have been arrested.

16:12.782 --> 16:14.082
Yes sir.

16:14.991 --> 16:16.566
Can I rest easy?

16:17.616 --> 16:19.175
Of course, sir.

16:20.157 --> 16:21.815
You will arrest him and humiliate him.

16:22.575 --> 16:24.157
Then we throw the party.

16:25.991 --> 16:28.324
Now the president is
going to dance a waltz.

16:28.325 --> 16:30.580
Or spend the night
playing the piano...

16:30.581 --> 16:31.781
Excuse.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.082
And crying with anger.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.565
Thank you, Mr. President.

16:44.475 --> 16:46.075
I'm a great cop.

16:47.825 --> 16:49.857
But I can also be
a great artist.

16:52.491 --> 16:55.900
You tell me. Excuse.

17:18.223 --> 17:20.633
- Is that me?
- No.

17:23.515 --> 17:24.915
It should be me.

17:26.390 --> 17:27.790
But it's a horse.

17:28.490 --> 17:31.282
Why do not we buy two
horses and run away?

17:33.074 --> 17:35.616
Of course. Can you ride?

17:35.617 --> 17:39.091
- Yeah. You forgot I'm from the south?
- Me too.

17:39.783 --> 17:40.983
Let's go.

17:42.450 --> 17:43.750
Do you dare?

17:44.825 --> 17:46.125
Together.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.440
Of course.

17:50.115 --> 17:51.775
Let's leave together...

17:53.700 --> 17:55.650
And then you follow alone...

17:57.075 --> 17:58.475
as always.

18:00.490 --> 18:01.790
Let's go.

18:02.740 --> 18:04.040
Let's go.

18:11.140 --> 18:12.864
They say that Chile is an island

18:12.865 --> 18:15.332
And that the mountain
range is a second sea.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.774
A kind of giant wave
that never breaks.

18:18.775 --> 18:22.282
On the other side there
is a strangely flat earth

18:22.283 --> 18:24.158
Called "Argentina".

18:26.515 --> 18:29.114
It's a green country, really.

18:29.115 --> 18:31.632
With agriculture and war.

18:35.232 --> 18:36.532
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.233
- Passports, please.
- Yes.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.408
Here they are.

18:46.600 --> 18:51.207
Here he says that his name
is Ricardo Reyes Basoalto.

18:51.208 --> 18:53.758
In my passport
says Pablo Neruda.

18:54.915 --> 18:56.489
But here it says "Reyes".

18:56.490 --> 18:59.382
Because "Neruda"
Is the artistic name.

19:00.408 --> 19:02.075
It is my name of war.

19:04.990 --> 19:09.289
If you have two names, you
can not leave the country.

19:09.290 --> 19:11.514
They're waiting for
me on the other side.

19:11.515 --> 19:13.015
I can walk.

19:16.325 --> 19:19.189
I'm sorry. It's the law.

19:19.190 --> 19:21.825
Turn around. Good afternoon.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.524
The first house is
the first house.

19:45.525 --> 19:48.649
Neruda is a man from the
mountains and from the guides.

19:48.650 --> 19:51.439
It is not colch é in the
floor nor clean bathrooms.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.640
Come in.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.790
Perfect.

19:57.533 --> 20:00.232
- Wonderful.
- Thanks for lying.

20:00.233 --> 20:03.258
At least we will not eat
lying down like Nero.

20:04.825 --> 20:08.157
Here we put the grand piano.

20:08.158 --> 20:10.741
Under the window,
the pool table.

20:11.365 --> 20:13.440
Here, the ballroom.

20:14.158 --> 20:16.657
Do you know the only problem
in this place, Victor?

20:16.658 --> 20:17.958
Which is?

20:18.783 --> 20:20.841
They'll never find me here.

20:21.490 --> 20:24.307
"Do you want them to find you?"
- No.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.950
But I wanted to feel them closer.

20:38.225 --> 20:39.625
No one touches anything.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.449
The astute Peluchonneau commission

20:45.450 --> 20:48.358
Leads the operation as if it
were the conquest of Egypt.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.699
This house is filled
with precious objects,

20:53.700 --> 20:56.150
The only thing
Neruda really loves.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.599
There is nobody.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.100
But there is no one.

21:03.158 --> 21:05.349
Of course, the order
arrived late.

21:05.350 --> 21:08.824
At this hour the poet
must be cutting onions

21:08.825 --> 21:11.440
For his disgusting conger baked.

21:27.515 --> 21:29.532
THE WOMAN IN THE ZOOL GOSPEL

21:33.783 --> 21:36.741
"Come and be born with me,
brother to the police."

22:05.350 --> 22:06.750
Nothing special.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.358
I have seen all this in the
prostrations of Callao.

22:21.325 --> 22:22.758
It's beautiful, this house.

22:23.433 --> 22:24.833
It's horrible!

22:25.700 --> 22:27.000
It's beautiful.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.657
A woman goes to the zoo
and never comes back.

22:37.658 --> 22:39.864
Gray men investigate.

22:39.865 --> 22:42.532
Dirty men, like me.

22:43.890 --> 22:45.425
Why am I reading this?

22:46.075 --> 22:49.365
These writers have never been
police officers with copper hearts.

22:50.490 --> 22:53.824
They do not know what it is to kick
a body with the support of the law.

22:53.825 --> 22:57.450
They do not know how wonderful
the criminal imagination is.

22:58.325 --> 22:59.825
But that does not matter.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.132
I'm here and Neruda is here.

23:03.133 --> 23:06.782
Must be writing words in
unexpected sequences.

23:06.783 --> 23:08.825
That cheap poetry.

23:10.158 --> 23:12.533
Must be between four
walls and a roof.

23:13.365 --> 23:14.565
Like me.

23:44.308 --> 23:45.989
- Pablo.
- I'm taking a breath.

23:45.990 --> 23:47.739
We can not stay here!

23:47.740 --> 23:50.074
Pablo, have ordered your arrest!

23:50.075 --> 23:52.989
"Not now, Delia.
"Is it true?" Read.

23:52.990 --> 23:57.007
- Come on, Pablo.
- Read! This is the best part.

23:57.008 --> 23:58.657
"It's true.
- Read.

23:58.658 --> 24:00.407
"They look for Neruda all over the country."

24:00.408 --> 24:03.489
Minister Miguel
Gonzales Castillo,

24:03.490 --> 24:05.907
Who ordered the arrest
of Senator Pablo Neruda,

24:05.908 --> 24:09.032
"Stated that the
poet fled his home."

24:09.033 --> 24:10.824
"It's a fact.
"It's true.

24:10.825 --> 24:13.282
"The commission Oscar Peluchonneau"

24:13.283 --> 24:17.114
Dispatched 300 policemen in
the searches to the poet,

24:17.115 --> 24:21.188
"Which is subject to 541
days of imprisonment."

24:21.189 --> 24:22.489
300 cops!

24:22.490 --> 24:26.989
"They are searching the
homes of Neruda's friends."

24:26.990 --> 24:30.025
- "It is imminent..."
- 300 cops!

24:31.033 --> 24:33.157
It's a good amount, is not it?

24:33.158 --> 24:34.949
There are many, Paul.

24:34.950 --> 24:37.582
And why are not these
shits coming after me?

24:37.583 --> 24:40.199
Do not be vulgar, do not yell.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.907
Are you hitting on
my friends' houses?

24:42.908 --> 24:44.782
And do not come here to get me?

24:44.783 --> 24:47.949
"You're my friend, are not you?"
Pablo, you drank half a bottle.

24:47.950 --> 24:50.114
I want to know, I'm asking.

24:50.115 --> 24:52.824
If you're looking for
me at friends' houses,

24:52.825 --> 24:54.657
Should not they come here?

24:54.658 --> 24:58.699
"Is it my friend or not?"
- No one knows I live here!

24:58.700 --> 25:00.364
So, never come!

25:00.365 --> 25:03.032
If nobody knows, they
will never come here.

25:03.033 --> 25:05.989
You will not find me.
Or are not you my friend?

25:05.990 --> 25:08.950
Behave and do not yell.

25:20.250 --> 25:23.115
Olivier, the founder of the police.

25:23.658 --> 25:25.439
The chief caretaker.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.175
The best of the best.

25:28.740 --> 25:30.040
My dad.

25:30.500 --> 25:31.824
Did not want to recognize me,

25:31.825 --> 25:34.340
But I proved by the bureaucracy
that I am your son.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.215
Now I am Peluchonneau, too.

25:38.658 --> 25:41.841
Olivier, Olivier Peluchonneau.

25:44.325 --> 25:45.725
Thanks dad.

26:19.058 --> 26:20.907
What's it?
The maid did not come?

26:20.908 --> 26:23.450
Sink soap spoils my hands.

26:24.825 --> 26:26.449
Look at them as they are.

26:26.450 --> 26:27.650
Delia...

26:29.283 --> 26:31.399
Hygiene is a bourgeois value.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.465
We do not clean the house
for political reasons.

26:34.908 --> 26:36.208
Senator.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.864
Are they sticking it all over?

26:40.865 --> 26:43.657
Yeah. Do not worry,
we're pulling out.

26:43.658 --> 26:45.157
Do not!

26:45.158 --> 26:48.491
We need to keep them.
It's historically rich, is not it?

26:49.015 --> 26:50.450
You're saying, senator.

26:51.825 --> 26:53.357
Jara...

26:53.358 --> 26:56.788
- Who are you?
Jara is the new protector.

26:56.789 --> 26:57.989
His name is Alvaro.

26:57.990 --> 27:01.282
Alvaro Jara.
A sad young man, like me.

27:01.283 --> 27:03.989
"You take care of my safety?"
- Yes sir.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.949
He also represents the Party.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.739
Another lost youth.

27:07.740 --> 27:09.489
I'm going to give you a mission, Jara.

27:09.490 --> 27:13.524
Go to the library and bring
me a quechua dictionary.

27:13.525 --> 27:15.989
- And a "Fauna of the Americas".
- It's clear.

27:15.990 --> 27:17.657
It's for the clandestine book.

27:17.658 --> 27:20.299
- Do you have the manuscript?
- A sketch.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.700
Want to see?

27:22.890 --> 27:24.465
There is not much, but...

27:24.865 --> 27:27.325
Here it is. "General Corner".

27:27.825 --> 27:30.239
Thirty c's of thirty poems.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.757
In thirty envelopes?

27:33.058 --> 27:34.364
Were they working?

27:34.365 --> 27:36.632
Not only by writing.

27:36.975 --> 27:39.424
Look! Thank you.

27:39.425 --> 27:42.007
Publisher Seventh Cycle.

27:42.008 --> 27:46.414
Neruda likes sex,
crime and violence.

27:46.415 --> 27:50.114
Police books make me forget
that the police are after me.

27:50.115 --> 27:51.449
This can not be forgotten.

27:51.450 --> 27:53.250
- I will.
- Waiting.

27:58.475 --> 28:01.014
- For Picasso.
- The blind painter.

28:01.015 --> 28:02.590
Very well. See you later.

28:27.850 --> 28:30.299
The thirty poems are flying.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.574
If I intercept one and burn,

28:32.575 --> 28:35.990
The other 29 will reach
the 29-red hands.

28:37.725 --> 28:41.258
Nothing can be done in
the face of a crook.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.782
- Good Morning.
- How can I help you?

29:05.783 --> 29:07.991
We scheduled a visit
with the President.

29:08.490 --> 29:09.990
Did they arrest Neruda?

29:10.749 --> 29:11.949
Do not.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.758
So what are you doing here?

29:14.240 --> 29:15.824
Did you search his house?

29:15.825 --> 29:18.658
- Yes of course.
- Was it there?

29:19.325 --> 29:21.839
- No.
- Where will it be?

29:21.840 --> 29:24.840
- We do not know.
- It has to be somewhere.

29:25.950 --> 29:27.250
You're right.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.824
Seek your first wife.

29:29.825 --> 29:32.324
There must always be
a wonderful plan.

29:32.325 --> 29:35.175
Listen, let's do this.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.464
But tell the President, please,

29:39.465 --> 29:41.199
We are looking for
you relentlessly...

29:41.200 --> 29:43.032
- No, no.
- Why not?

29:43.033 --> 29:45.407
I'm not your employee, you shit.

29:45.408 --> 29:49.857
I'm your civilian superior and I
order you to get this Communist.

29:49.858 --> 29:51.491
What if I get it?

29:52.365 --> 29:54.825
- How is it?
"What if I get him?"

29:57.264 --> 29:58.464
Excuse.

29:58.465 --> 30:00.090
A "civil superior"?

30:00.783 --> 30:02.758
A civilian is never superior to me.

30:05.090 --> 30:06.989
Why do not you dress?

30:06.990 --> 30:10.114
- With what?
- I do not know, there are clothes on.

30:10.115 --> 30:12.199
There's a dress in the chair.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.075
I'm a lady, Pablo.

30:15.615 --> 30:18.324
Without clean clothes,
I can not get up.

30:18.325 --> 30:20.200
Nor do I have clean clothes.

30:22.725 --> 30:24.408
Then get it out.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.025
Come here.

30:28.615 --> 30:30.015
He makes me a son.

30:42.808 --> 30:45.491
The poet struggles to
say something romantic.

30:46.783 --> 30:49.341
Delia, please.
- Please what?

30:53.039 --> 30:54.239
What's wrong with you?

30:54.240 --> 30:57.365
Anything! I want to get some
air and I'm stuck here.

31:00.325 --> 31:01.625
Then, leave.

31:02.990 --> 31:04.390
But they'll kill you.

31:24.683 --> 31:27.114
May the Duke of Braganza die,

31:27.115 --> 31:29.990
That falls from the horse, the Emperor.

31:33.075 --> 31:37.740
I'm a fish too.
I live in the Pacific Ocean.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.475
Max Havelaar, thank you.

31:41.490 --> 31:43.032
They're chasing me.

31:44.158 --> 31:47.491
A Chinese girl with
wet hair, I know.

31:51.075 --> 31:54.925
There's a place where you smoke pio.
You lie on your side...

31:55.490 --> 31:57.439
Xoxotinha, xoxotinha...

31:57.440 --> 32:00.357
Hidden, warm here...

32:02.390 --> 32:03.890
They're chasing me!

32:13.265 --> 32:16.615
The elegant Peluchonneau commission
works on a secret mission.

32:20.725 --> 32:24.525
The president has a plan
to humiliate Neruda.

32:25.075 --> 32:28.583
So I'm going to the station
to get a Dutch one.

32:29.889 --> 32:30.989
What?

32:30.990 --> 32:33.865
"Is he the wife of Neruda?"
- Yes.

32:36.640 --> 32:37.840
Come here.

32:40.975 --> 32:44.550
Every good cop knows how and
when to sacrifice himself.

32:45.115 --> 32:48.657
Besides, this blonde
has fire in her veins.

32:49.658 --> 32:51.525
I would never have left her.

32:55.215 --> 32:57.457
- Speak Spanish?
- A little.

32:58.025 --> 33:00.939
"And how was it treated?"
- More or less.

33:00.940 --> 33:04.424
It would help us a lot if
we gave some interviews.

33:04.425 --> 33:07.107
I could tell how
it was abandoned.

33:07.108 --> 33:10.732
Pablo left you with your
sick daughter, did not you?

33:10.733 --> 33:13.657
I want Pablo to pay
me one million pesos.

33:13.658 --> 33:18.625
Pablo has a lot of money because
he writes very long poems.

33:20.258 --> 33:22.282
Of course, that's fair.

33:22.283 --> 33:26.032
It is therefore important that,
when talking to journalists,

33:26.033 --> 33:28.507
You use the right word.

33:28.508 --> 33:31.732
- "Bábio".
- Bigamo?

33:31.733 --> 33:33.400
"Bábio".

33:34.983 --> 33:40.125
Yeah, bigamo.
Pablo loves women.

33:41.258 --> 33:43.458
This woman is going to destroy Neruda.

33:49.358 --> 33:50.758
Do not let me down.

33:52.758 --> 33:55.083
Many women like cops.

33:56.458 --> 33:58.332
Dream of cleaning their homes

33:58.333 --> 34:01.000
And change their dressings
when they get shot.

34:04.715 --> 34:06.775
The kiss of the butcher wolf.

34:09.925 --> 34:13.900
After you read it, it's
the turn of the dogs.

34:14.757 --> 34:18.233
It does not matter that she has
the stale stench of the poet.

34:19.398 --> 34:22.190
I'm used to that squid sweat.

34:27.366 --> 34:28.666
I love you.

34:31.197 --> 34:33.282
Do not imagine how I love you.

34:37.158 --> 34:41.708
For you I have a walking path and a
zoo in the middle of the desert.

34:59.823 --> 35:02.665
Those who flee from there
have seen a stanza of salt.

35:04.191 --> 35:05.857
But no one escapes,

35:05.858 --> 35:09.183
Because the captain of the
prison is a blue-eyed fox.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.416
His name is Augusto Pinochet.

35:28.758 --> 35:29.958
You come?

35:31.575 --> 35:32.775
Do not.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.032
I need to think why
I'm helping you.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.333
See you later.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.757
We are here, we are
God of the day,

36:02.758 --> 36:06.549
With Mrs. Maria Hagenaar,
wife of Pablo Neruda,

36:06.550 --> 36:08.966
To tell us his verse.

36:09.508 --> 36:13.299
Lady Maria, it is true
that Pablo Neruda

36:13.300 --> 36:14.600
Is it a bug?

36:18.508 --> 36:23.007
We have posters that show
the opinion of the people,

36:23.008 --> 36:25.699
Saying, for example,
"Neruda traitor",

36:25.700 --> 36:29.157
"Communist Neruda,"
things like that.

36:29.158 --> 36:32.825
- Whose traitor?
- Mrs...

36:34.700 --> 36:36.433
This is a lie.

36:40.950 --> 36:43.282
He is a great man.

36:43.283 --> 36:46.065
You owe me a lot of money, but...

36:46.066 --> 36:47.791
is very beautiful.

36:49.116 --> 36:52.175
I like the way Neruda sleeps.

36:53.608 --> 36:55.925
He is not a traitor.

36:56.525 --> 36:59.632
He's handsome, Neruda.
He is not a traitor.

36:59.633 --> 37:01.775
He is a great man...

37:06.133 --> 37:09.091
Thus fails the strategy of
the geniuses of intrigue.

37:12.491 --> 37:17.316
Mrs. Maria ran out of the
gods of the storm...

37:23.675 --> 37:25.816
Hello. Ol ل, Chile.

37:26.841 --> 37:28.925
This poet is a public danger

37:29.591 --> 37:31.483
And an unforgettable lover.

37:32.658 --> 37:35.465
Any information about
your whereabouts

37:35.466 --> 37:37.258
Will be rewarded.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.624
My name is Oscar Peluchonneau,

37:39.625 --> 37:43.466
Of the Chilean National
Police of Investigation.

37:44.841 --> 37:49.507
Let's take a musical break.
We'll be back.

37:49.508 --> 37:52.465
The World F ron of
Intellectuals for Peace

37:52.466 --> 37:56.690
Is pleased to introduce the
anti-fascist creator...

37:56.691 --> 37:58.958
Pablo Picasso!

38:01.841 --> 38:07.083
This is a letter sent by
my friend, Pablo Neruda.

38:07.566 --> 38:11.190
In this instant, he is
Hidden under a bridge

38:11.191 --> 38:13.799
Or on a railway track.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.465
Even so, in clandestinity,

38:16.466 --> 38:21.233
The poet organizes resistance
against Chilean fascism.

38:22.066 --> 38:26.074
This is the testimony of
a Latin American giant

38:26.075 --> 38:30.291
Which illuminates the path of peace
for the workers of the world.

38:54.491 --> 38:59.591
Girl, when I die.

39:01.300 --> 39:05.908
Do not cry over my grave.

39:07.925 --> 39:13.466
Sing me a beautiful tune.

39:14.341 --> 39:19.158
Sing me "La Sandunga".

39:20.258 --> 39:25.633
Do not cry for me, do not.

39:26.258 --> 39:30.883
Cause if you cry I die.

39:31.883 --> 39:36.858
But if you sing to me.

39:37.466 --> 39:43.366
I always live And I never die.

39:44.405 --> 39:49.664
But if you sing to me.

39:50.236 --> 39:56.136
I always live And I never die.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.263
Hello.

40:18.350 --> 40:20.241
Stop this fight now!

40:21.091 --> 40:22.391
Elegance!

40:25.383 --> 40:28.524
- Sing, fat!
- I'm singing to the senator!

40:28.525 --> 40:30.691
Keep singing, fat!

40:32.550 --> 40:35.566
- It's my art!
- Joy Joy!

40:47.925 --> 40:53.341
But if you sing to me.

40:53.908 --> 40:59.808
I always live And I never die.

41:00.450 --> 41:03.007
- Come to the poet!
- Come on!

41:03.008 --> 41:06.275
- Come to Pablo Neruda!
- Thank you.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.924
Sorry for what happened.

41:08.925 --> 41:12.549
Say a poem. S um.

41:12.550 --> 41:16.124
The one like this:
"I can say the verses..."

41:16.125 --> 41:17.658
Say, go.

41:19.325 --> 41:24.866
"I can write the saddest
lines tonight."

41:25.658 --> 41:28.700
To think that I do not have it.

41:29.408 --> 41:33.024
Feeling that I lost it.

41:33.025 --> 41:38.658
To hear the night immense,
more immense without it.

41:39.575 --> 41:42.741
"And the verse falls on the soul..."

41:45.075 --> 41:46.491
Applause!

41:51.325 --> 41:54.166
You sent me another
detective novel, poet.

41:55.341 --> 41:56.541
Because?

41:59.841 --> 42:02.041
Good evening! Police!

42:03.183 --> 42:04.483
Good evening.

42:06.508 --> 42:09.441
How does he know that this is
my backyard and my school?

42:10.733 --> 42:14.050
My mother worked in a house
like this for 30 years.

42:21.158 --> 42:23.283
Where is it?
This shitty Communist?

42:25.258 --> 42:26.958
Are you going to want a call?

42:28.050 --> 42:31.933
You want one of the girls, Don Oscar?

42:35.466 --> 42:38.291
Each of these women
is my mother.

42:39.258 --> 42:43.208
I am the son of a prostitute,
of a venereal disease.

43:18.158 --> 43:20.025
Turn around! Let's go!

43:41.883 --> 43:44.775
My mother never knew the
name of my real father.

43:45.841 --> 43:50.125
When she was drunk she said
Mu oz, Martinez, Mardones...

43:50.925 --> 43:52.757
But he also closed his eyes

43:52.758 --> 43:55.674
And suspected it was the
Peluchonneau commission.

43:55.675 --> 43:59.219
A silent lord, chief
of all the police.

44:00.591 --> 44:01.991
Did he pay you?

44:05.758 --> 44:07.058
Do you know who is?

44:09.158 --> 44:10.458
He's a politician.

44:11.366 --> 44:12.666
A communist.

44:15.966 --> 44:17.958
I did not know you were a communist.

44:26.658 --> 44:30.666
How long will you hold me here?
I have things to do.

44:36.925 --> 44:39.191
Look, let's just say one thing.

44:41.075 --> 44:43.115
It's not every day we find

44:43.116 --> 44:46.382
A poet of this category,
in our house.

44:46.383 --> 44:49.749
For me, it was a miracle.

44:49.750 --> 44:54.108
He was there with me
and I was with him.

44:54.658 --> 44:57.241
He told me we were the same.

44:58.691 --> 45:02.055
He asked me what I
felt when I sang.

45:02.966 --> 45:07.157
Imagine. I shared things that
I do not share with anyone.

45:07.158 --> 45:10.157
I told him that I like
jazz and classical music.

45:10.158 --> 45:11.966
I've added a...

45:12.633 --> 45:14.774
A minuet that I love.

45:14.775 --> 45:17.091
From Johann Sebastian Bach.

45:17.716 --> 45:20.907
I sang that and he was thrilled.

45:20.908 --> 45:23.824
He told me that I
was an art worker,

45:23.825 --> 45:27.616
An artist like him,
on an equal footing.

45:29.216 --> 45:31.008
And all of a sudden, he...

45:34.825 --> 45:37.491
Told me a poetry so beautiful.

45:38.425 --> 45:39.725
Long.

45:40.908 --> 45:44.866
He put his hand on my
knee, a hand so warm.

45:45.533 --> 45:46.866
And he told me here.

45:49.341 --> 45:50.641
Slowly.

45:53.758 --> 45:55.983
From artist to artist,
you understand?

45:57.241 --> 45:58.908
From man to man.

46:00.158 --> 46:02.200
With human respect.

46:05.408 --> 46:09.066
But a dog like you would
never understand.

46:38.966 --> 46:41.382
- Where's Victor?
- I do not know.

46:41.383 --> 46:43.383
- How do you not know?
- Don Pablo...

46:46.450 --> 46:48.825
Did you go out for
a walk last night?

46:51.553 --> 46:52.990
Do not.

46:52.991 --> 46:54.866
"You went out to walk?"
- No.

46:55.558 --> 46:57.158
Need more uk?

46:58.075 --> 46:59.749
Who do you Think You Are?

47:00.150 --> 47:02.657
So stay here and do not leave.

47:02.658 --> 47:04.533
If you leave, you'll get it.

47:04.958 --> 47:06.407
They'll rip your clothes off,

47:06.408 --> 47:09.490
Take photos of front and
back and send to France.

47:09.491 --> 47:13.407
They will glue everywhere, even in kites.
It's going to suck.

47:13.408 --> 47:16.075
Good ideas. All.

47:16.950 --> 47:20.032
Reds know the language
of violence well.

47:20.033 --> 47:22.157
No one will get me, learn!

47:22.158 --> 47:25.532
All Chile is hunting me and
no one is going to get me!

47:25.533 --> 47:28.407
Learn to behave like
a man, little boy!

47:28.408 --> 47:30.032
Wear men's clothing!

47:30.033 --> 47:32.882
Grow a mustache, buy a
gun, I do not know!

47:32.883 --> 47:34.866
Learn to respect me!

47:37.683 --> 47:39.325
Who does he think he is?

47:48.475 --> 47:49.975
Easy, sweetheart.

47:52.450 --> 47:56.075
"And here they found a
people who sang..."

48:02.033 --> 48:03.783
"For duty and love gathered..."

48:05.766 --> 48:08.950
"And the lean girl
fell with her flag..."

48:10.475 --> 48:14.033
"And the smiling young man
fell beside him, wounded..."

48:14.475 --> 48:17.890
"For these dead, our dead..."

48:17.891 --> 48:20.200
"I ask for punishment," at
the end of each sentence.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.140
GENERAL CORNER

48:24.141 --> 48:26.506
For the dead, our dead...

48:26.507 --> 48:27.807
I beg the penalty!

48:27.808 --> 48:30.015
For those whose blood
spattered the nation...

48:30.016 --> 48:31.324
I beg the penalty!

48:31.325 --> 48:33.907
For the executioner who
ordered this death...

48:33.908 --> 48:36.157
I beg the penalty!

48:36.158 --> 48:39.490
For the traitor who
prospered with the crime...

48:39.491 --> 48:41.782
I beg the penalty!

48:41.783 --> 48:44.207
For who gave the
order of agony...

48:44.208 --> 48:46.282
I beg the penalty!

48:46.283 --> 48:50.157
"For those who have defended this
crime, I ask for punishment."

48:50.158 --> 48:53.949
I do not want you to give me the
most splattered of our blood.

48:53.950 --> 48:55.699
I ask for punishment.

48:55.700 --> 48:57.199
I do not want ambassadors.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.490
Nor were they at home in peace.

48:59.491 --> 49:03.447
I want to see them tried in
this place, in this place.

49:03.448 --> 49:05.233
"I want punishment!"

49:08.008 --> 49:09.641
Thank you thank you.

49:11.933 --> 49:13.940
"Here, my friend.
- Thank you comrade.

49:13.941 --> 49:15.508
- You're welcome.
- Excuse...

49:16.783 --> 49:18.683
Sorry, I do not want to bother you.

49:20.075 --> 49:22.325
- What is your name?
- Silvia.

49:23.158 --> 49:25.366
Can I give you a kiss?

49:25.991 --> 49:27.616
Yes, of course, Silvia.

49:32.100 --> 49:33.400
Mrs...

49:34.940 --> 49:36.140
Forgiveness.

49:36.141 --> 49:39.866
Do not tell him he autographed
his book at this party.

49:43.225 --> 49:45.200
We are not here.

49:47.891 --> 49:50.782
I'm a trustworthy person.

49:50.783 --> 49:54.200
I have been a militant since I was 14.

49:54.741 --> 49:57.991
But the senator does not
need to worry so much.

49:59.450 --> 50:01.991
Do not you? Because?

50:02.933 --> 50:04.233
Excuse.

50:05.308 --> 50:09.783
If you're here, at this
party, and start reciting...

50:11.325 --> 50:13.324
"The land, blabla..."

50:13.325 --> 50:15.199
"Love, babe..."

50:15.200 --> 50:17.657
"The punishments, blabla..."

50:17.658 --> 50:20.537
I say it means

50:20.538 --> 50:24.412
That the government does
not want to arrest him.

50:25.575 --> 50:29.699
If they do, they get an
international problem.

50:29.700 --> 50:32.032
- Ma'am, enough.
- Because it's political.

50:32.033 --> 50:37.933
Government is concerned to
pursue it, but not to arrest it.

50:37.934 --> 50:39.557
Never.

50:39.558 --> 50:42.140
The senator is a communist,
like you and me.

50:42.141 --> 50:44.782
Yes, but it has
special protection.

50:44.783 --> 50:46.990
And I'll toast to that,

50:46.991 --> 50:50.740
Because we all need
the senator poet

50:50.741 --> 50:54.075
Keep writing about the
suffering of the people.

50:57.475 --> 51:00.074
Madam, he is protected by the
leadership of the Party.

51:00.075 --> 51:02.990
Do you know what I want to know?
Listen...

51:02.991 --> 51:08.349
When communism comes, everyone
will be the same as him.

51:08.350 --> 51:10.408
Or will they be the same as me?

51:11.491 --> 51:15.657
To me, I've been cleaning
up the fucking bourgeois.

51:15.658 --> 51:18.458
Since I'm 11 years old.

51:25.350 --> 51:27.300
They will all be the same to me.

51:28.558 --> 51:32.200
Let's eat in bed and
fornicate in the kitchen.

51:34.575 --> 51:37.475
For that we fight, comrade!

51:43.075 --> 51:45.824
"In Bogot they met
Morinigo, Trujillo,"

51:45.825 --> 51:49.533
Gonzales Videla, Somoza,
Dutra, and applauded.

51:50.158 --> 51:52.907
"You, young American,
do not know them..."

51:52.908 --> 51:54.425
Waiting...

51:56.341 --> 51:58.666
What if you read with the other voice?

52:00.058 --> 52:03.058
- What voice?
- A poet, Pablo.

52:06.225 --> 52:09.808
"You, young American,
do not know them."

52:10.575 --> 52:14.791
They are the dark
vampires of our skies.

52:15.450 --> 52:18.782
Bitter the shadows of their wings.

52:18.783 --> 52:22.925
"Pris es, martyr,
death, gave..."

52:26.850 --> 52:28.491
- Finished?
- Yes Yes.

52:31.225 --> 52:33.525
- Where are we going?
- Valparaíso.

52:33.526 --> 52:34.974
Thank you.

52:34.975 --> 52:40.210
The senator needs to wait for
a Chinese merchant ship.

52:40.211 --> 52:41.311
AND...

52:42.058 --> 52:44.700
Delia, they do not
allow women on board.

52:51.241 --> 52:52.541
My love...

52:54.641 --> 52:56.041
All right, dear.

52:59.183 --> 53:00.383
Excuse.

53:06.666 --> 53:09.466
Good... we'll talk.

53:12.158 --> 53:14.566
- Good trip.
- Thank you, Victor.

53:17.083 --> 53:18.483
My love...

53:21.516 --> 53:22.916
I will not cry.

53:43.683 --> 53:47.158
A good cop would follow him
to the fugitive's house.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.050
But I'm a bad cop.

53:50.433 --> 53:54.216
I like it when the suspects
confess with whispers or shouts.

53:58.350 --> 54:00.366
"Come and be with me, brother."

54:01.158 --> 54:05.033
Give me your hand, from the
depths of your disseminated pain.

54:05.725 --> 54:08.482
You will not come back from
the bottom of the rocks.

54:08.483 --> 54:11.399
You will not return
from underground time.

54:11.400 --> 54:14.324
Your angry voice will not return.

54:14.325 --> 54:16.825
"They shall not return
thine eyes pierced..."

54:21.616 --> 54:23.616
"Here I was punished."

54:29.866 --> 54:31.657
Because the jewelry did not shine.

54:31.658 --> 54:34.991
"And the earth did not deliver the
stone and the grain in due time."

54:36.033 --> 54:39.658
"I come to speak through
your dead mouth."

54:40.325 --> 54:42.857
Like a river of buried tigers.

54:42.858 --> 54:48.758
And let me cry for
hours, days, years.

54:49.450 --> 54:52.899
"Blind ages, stellar centuries."

54:52.900 --> 54:56.992
Strangely...
I believe in you.

54:56.993 --> 54:58.293
I believe.

54:58.732 --> 55:01.290
I am glad.
I was the first to say:

55:01.291 --> 55:04.540
"Pablo, if you go to
trial, you will win."

55:04.541 --> 55:06.307
So let's go get him together.

55:06.308 --> 55:08.990
But I do not know where, they
do not tell me anything.

55:08.991 --> 55:10.324
Because?

55:10.325 --> 55:12.607
They distrust me because
I'm not Chilean.

55:12.608 --> 55:13.974
I understand.

55:13.975 --> 55:16.575
Let's stay in touch, maybe
I'll find out something.

55:16.576 --> 55:18.102
Yes wait.

55:18.866 --> 55:21.449
We just learned that
Neruda left Chile.

55:22.158 --> 55:24.575
- Really?
- Yeah, he left.

55:26.266 --> 55:27.566
How incredible.

55:29.491 --> 55:30.791
Because?

55:31.450 --> 55:33.908
Because you're watching
over the borders.

55:36.850 --> 55:38.991
Do you think he's still in Chile?

55:40.158 --> 55:42.658
No, he must be outside.

55:52.958 --> 55:54.699
I'm going to Valparaíso.

55:54.700 --> 55:56.516
Do not. Because?

55:57.058 --> 55:58.783
To see if anyone saw him leave.

56:00.408 --> 56:02.640
I think he's still in Chile.

56:02.641 --> 56:05.116
But he just said he was abroad.

56:06.325 --> 56:09.958
Do not. You said that
he had escaped by ship.

56:10.891 --> 56:14.391
This is a good example of
a whispered confession.

56:18.475 --> 56:22.408
The lucidity of the policeman overcomes
the stupidity of the Spaniard.

56:34.758 --> 56:36.933
What looks so much out the window?

56:37.758 --> 56:39.058
People.

56:43.383 --> 56:45.825
"Is this silk?"
- No.

56:46.457 --> 56:47.657
So what is it?

56:47.658 --> 56:50.541
A sailor traded the cloth
for 12 bottles of wine.

56:52.124 --> 56:53.424
Good business.

56:53.425 --> 56:56.857
The poet will always applaud
an unfair exchange.

56:56.858 --> 56:59.157
Do I have to pretend
I'm a sailor?

56:59.158 --> 57:02.907
Do not. An eccentric guy, a
rich man from Central America.

57:02.908 --> 57:05.099
Embarking to Ecuador
or to Mexico.

57:05.100 --> 57:08.558
- Does he have to be Chilean?
- In those outfits? I doubt that.

57:09.241 --> 57:12.599
Do not shrink your belly. Release.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.866
- As?
- Release the air.

57:18.624 --> 57:19.824
That.

57:19.825 --> 57:21.640
Do not tell anyone my secret.

57:21.641 --> 57:24.533
Do not worry. No one cares.

57:26.850 --> 57:31.282
"He danced in Vin م del Mar
surrounded by jewels and goblets.

57:31.283 --> 57:35.450
But the black eyes stare
through the black night..."

57:42.416 --> 57:46.990
"But the man who caresses
you stops by the desert.

57:46.991 --> 57:51.991
Near the sea coast, in a world
devastated by death..."

58:00.058 --> 58:02.491
"Every people with their pain..."

58:24.325 --> 58:25.625
Don Pablo?

58:34.766 --> 58:35.966
Don Pablo?

58:54.708 --> 58:55.908
Gentleman!

58:57.616 --> 58:58.816
Gentleman!

59:04.350 --> 59:06.058
Sorry, I do not have anything.

59:41.600 --> 59:44.133
The smart cop smells
the Asian odor.

59:45.958 --> 59:47.258
He is close.

59:57.958 --> 59:59.457
Where were you?

59:59.458 --> 01:00:00.990
They found us. Let's go.

01:00:00.991 --> 01:00:03.200
Not yet. We're lost.

01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:06.716
Where are we?

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.825
- I said it was a good idea.
"Still, it was interesting.

01:00:17.391 --> 01:00:19.825
To write well, you must
know how to delete.

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:47.925
There is no terror to this persecution.

01:01:16.283 --> 01:01:17.583
Why do I read this?

01:01:19.966 --> 01:01:21.166
I want to know.

01:01:22.633 --> 01:01:24.341
What is your novel about?

01:01:33.308 --> 01:01:36.199
The poet has the fever
of the artistic spirits

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.108
Who think the world is
something they have imagined.

01:01:57.525 --> 01:01:58.840
The flies.

01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:00.833
Again, a swarm of flies.

01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:04.825
What is it?

01:02:05.516 --> 01:02:07.700
The last column of the Red Army?

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.325
It's here.

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.758
Ordinary little man.

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:15.740
Almost every night,

01:03:15.741 --> 01:03:17.657
The president sleeps
like a child.

01:03:17.658 --> 01:03:21.890
However, whenever you eat
escargot before bed,

01:03:21.891 --> 01:03:23.650
Must dream about Neruda.

01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:26.508
Senator!

01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:29.558
Let's take another turn.

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:50.782
- Enough, Senator!
- Fuck.

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:53.975
Here we are, Gabriel
Gonzales of shit!

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.141
- Pablo.
- Jorge, how are you?

01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:22.583
We have a plan to get
you out of Chile.

01:04:23.225 --> 01:04:25.057
"Does the Party know?"
- Of course you know.

01:04:25.058 --> 01:04:26.891
The Secretary-General agrees.

01:04:31.116 --> 01:04:32.316
I'll go.

01:04:34.016 --> 01:04:36.791
No, drink something.

01:04:36.792 --> 01:04:39.850
- No, thank you.
"Do not you want to eat anything?"

01:04:40.808 --> 01:04:42.582
See you tomorrow?

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:44.558
- I do not think so.
- As?

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:48.165
I'm going to ask the
Party to let me go.

01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:51.041
- Do not be an idiot, Jara.
- Please...

01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:55.849
This escape from the
south seems very risky.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.765
"You're not a country man.
"It was the Party's decision.

01:04:58.766 --> 01:05:01.015
But the decision is up to you.

01:05:01.016 --> 01:05:03.282
"You accept it or not.
- I already accepted.

01:05:03.283 --> 01:05:06.099
Why do not you listen
to what he's saying?

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.808
I know what I do with my life.

01:05:09.766 --> 01:05:11.674
They're all trapped but me.

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:15.165
You think I'm a king?
What are you waiting for?

01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:17.833
- In this case, stay.
- I can 't.

01:05:18.583 --> 01:05:20.933
I can not stay, I must run away.

01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:24.983
It is that you want
a grand escape.

01:05:28.418 --> 01:05:29.618
Is not it?

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:33.374
I will not get into the game
of these fucking fascists.

01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:35.474
I'll be their worst nightmare.

01:05:35.475 --> 01:05:38.557
For this, I have to
be a popular giant.

01:05:38.558 --> 01:05:40.057
You can not do that.

01:05:40.058 --> 01:05:42.207
- I already did.
- You can not do that.

01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:46.099
Will you say that you used
this chase as an excuse

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.265
To become a saint.

01:05:48.266 --> 01:05:50.140
That we were never repressed.

01:05:50.141 --> 01:05:52.850
That we like to live and suffer.

01:05:53.766 --> 01:05:56.208
But they're really killing us.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:01.725
See, I ask you to be a
little more humble.

01:06:07.733 --> 01:06:09.233
Good luck on your trip.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.683
"What's the matter with you?"
- As well?

01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:49.365
Do you know what to do with your life?

01:06:50.066 --> 01:06:52.224
Delia, please.

01:06:52.225 --> 01:06:54.932
- People will notice.
"Realize what?"

01:06:54.933 --> 01:06:56.265
That the artist here is me.

01:06:56.266 --> 01:06:58.265
- No, the artist is me!
- It's me.

01:06:58.266 --> 01:07:01.057
- The artist here is me!
"You are nothing, Pablo.

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:03.182
What's the story
of being a giant?

01:07:03.183 --> 01:07:05.549
It is what it is for me to be.

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:08.724
- You do not know?
- Please, Pablo.

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:11.265
If you do not like it,
walk out that door.

01:07:11.266 --> 01:07:13.224
No one is chasing you.

01:07:13.225 --> 01:07:14.682
What's the matter with you?

01:07:14.683 --> 01:07:19.015
You choke me, do not
give me a cent.

01:07:19.016 --> 01:07:20.724
Look at me.

01:07:20.725 --> 01:07:23.682
I was a prince, you made
me turn this around.

01:07:23.683 --> 01:07:25.308
Of course I'm leaving.

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:27.849
Without life, I'm leaving.

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:31.265
When you arrest me, I tell you
that you want to be president.

01:07:31.266 --> 01:07:35.199
They will hunt him down and kill him.
She's going to be happy.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.132
Then I'll hit a river.

01:07:38.133 --> 01:07:41.482
You can kill yourself.
You can kill yourself if you want.

01:07:41.483 --> 01:07:43.975
That's how I write 20
more years about you.

01:08:20.908 --> 01:08:24.099
- Antonio Ruiz Lagorreta.
- Ornit soon.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.846
Ant, I thought I was
going to die with you.

01:08:27.848 --> 01:08:29.721
You gave me everything.

01:08:29.723 --> 01:08:32.991
Without you, I would be nothing.
Neither Communist.

01:08:34.082 --> 01:08:35.282
What?

01:08:36.557 --> 01:08:39.807
If it goes well, if I survive...

01:08:40.723 --> 01:08:42.973
Let's start separating.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:50.848
I do not worry about staying,
but I think about you.

01:08:51.432 --> 01:08:56.223
Writing saddens you.
You bury your head in the hands...

01:08:58.098 --> 01:09:00.098
It's lovely to be with you.

01:09:02.557 --> 01:09:04.890
It's like living in a
leafy neighborhood.

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:06.716
Ant...

01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:31.015
The little ant does
not know what to do.

01:09:31.015 --> 01:09:34.973
Think of the strength of your arm
and the clarity of your brain.

01:09:35.515 --> 01:09:38.598
And realizes that he will
live another 40 years.

01:09:42.622 --> 01:09:44.923
For a minute you
only see red horses.

01:10:21.375 --> 01:10:22.675
Excuse?

01:10:23.957 --> 01:10:26.175
- You may come in.
- Thank you.

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:28.150
Are you walking?

01:10:29.682 --> 01:10:31.350
- No.
- What is it?

01:10:32.141 --> 01:10:37.175
It is an arrest warrant issued
by the Chilean National Police.

01:10:38.557 --> 01:10:40.807
- No, but...
- No.

01:10:41.565 --> 01:10:42.865
- No.
- No.

01:10:43.225 --> 01:10:47.141
I am a person who dies
but is not arrested.

01:10:48.557 --> 01:10:49.857
Where is he?

01:10:50.391 --> 01:10:52.641
- It's not here.
- At where?

01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:57.516
You do not understand it, do you?

01:10:59.457 --> 01:11:02.681
- You do not understand anything.
- What?

01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:06.207
In this fiction, we all revolve
around the protagonist.

01:11:07.791 --> 01:11:10.766
- As?
- Books, for example.

01:11:12.432 --> 01:11:13.732
This one...

01:11:15.975 --> 01:11:17.874
That you were reading.

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:19.275
THE ANGEL DARK

01:11:20.557 --> 01:11:23.806
There is a pursuer, a fugitive,

01:11:23.807 --> 01:11:26.640
One principal and one secondary.

01:11:28.266 --> 01:11:30.849
No, but I...

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:33.600
I'm no secondary character.

01:11:35.307 --> 01:11:38.000
Why do you think he
did not kill you?

01:11:39.975 --> 01:11:41.599
Why can not you kill me?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.575
Could. Practice
shooting every day.

01:11:46.057 --> 01:11:47.707
No, you can not.

01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:49.616
Do not you?

01:11:50.141 --> 01:11:54.306
Not, of course. He wants you
to chase him south. You go?

01:11:54.307 --> 01:11:55.915
Are you okay?

01:11:56.682 --> 01:11:59.640
Did he hurt you?
Hit you?

01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:03.108
No, he asked me to
give you this message.

01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:05.974
If you want, I can kill you.

01:12:05.975 --> 01:12:08.307
I could not do that.

01:12:08.975 --> 01:12:10.332
Of course I can.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.165
- No.
- Yes.

01:12:13.166 --> 01:12:14.474
- No!
- Of course yes.

01:12:14.475 --> 01:12:16.850
He wrote that a long time ago.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.432
Have you ever seen
a bored prisoner?

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:25.140
In your head, you are writing
a fascinating novel.

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:28.974
He created you, the Trojan policeman.

01:12:28.975 --> 01:12:31.640
He created me, the absurd woman.

01:12:31.641 --> 01:12:33.308
He wrote to himself.

01:12:34.975 --> 01:12:36.825
The depraved fugitive.

01:12:37.225 --> 01:12:42.925
What you're saying
is modern nonsense,

01:12:43.732 --> 01:12:45.640
A golden lamb.

01:12:46.682 --> 01:12:48.640
Do not you like the
way he writes?

01:12:49.387 --> 01:12:50.587
Like.

01:12:51.807 --> 01:12:56.300
Do you think he only
thinks of land and love?

01:12:56.301 --> 01:12:57.640
Do not.

01:12:57.641 --> 01:13:02.508
He thinks of naked women, of
detectives pursuing him...

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.850
He created you
thinking of yourself.

01:13:07.432 --> 01:13:11.390
You, in your house,
reading his poems.

01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:14.107
You, in front of the mirror.

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:19.474
He created you
watching our feast,

01:13:19.475 --> 01:13:21.682
Immersed in our music.

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:27.249
Closed in a car,
with empty eyes.

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.725
A dog at night,

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:33.433
A bird during the day.

01:13:35.391 --> 01:13:38.766
It created you spying, waiting.

01:13:39.725 --> 01:13:43.724
He created you imprisoned,
a furious spy.

01:13:43.725 --> 01:13:47.266
Listening to things
you'll never understand.

01:13:50.582 --> 01:13:53.643
Depreciating ideas and words.

01:13:54.407 --> 01:13:56.720
One hundred meters from life.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.116
Powerless.

01:13:59.891 --> 01:14:01.308
Freile.

01:14:01.991 --> 01:14:05.683
He created you as the guardian
of an imaginary frontier.

01:14:09.225 --> 01:14:12.407
He thinks of you
thinking of himself.

01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:15.640
All the detectives are in love.

01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:19.725
In all the detective
novels there are beds.

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:22.325
Right.

01:14:24.057 --> 01:14:25.457
He writes well.

01:14:26.432 --> 01:14:27.832
He created me.

01:14:29.391 --> 01:14:30.691
But I...

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.007
I've held you.

01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:39.091
And in this hug, I'm going
to take him to jail.

01:14:40.307 --> 01:14:44.265
I'll make him sleep
and watch him dream.

01:14:44.266 --> 01:14:46.890
And I'm going to end up
sitting on his chest.

01:14:46.891 --> 01:14:48.600
Then you will chase after him.

01:14:49.432 --> 01:14:52.765
You will chase after him and arrest him.

01:14:54.225 --> 01:14:56.932
Or it will not enter
the history of men.

01:15:06.891 --> 01:15:08.491
Am I a fiction?

01:15:09.057 --> 01:15:10.257
Yes.

01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:13.750
"And you, is it a fiction?"
- No.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.825
I am real. And I am eternal.

01:15:21.707 --> 01:15:22.907
Excuse.

01:16:06.166 --> 01:16:08.191
Secondary character?

01:16:08.192 --> 01:16:09.724
I?

01:16:09.725 --> 01:16:11.882
Do not. No, sir.

01:16:12.682 --> 01:16:14.182
Because I'll get you.

01:16:48.166 --> 01:16:49.766
I hope you're right.

01:19:28.675 --> 01:19:29.875
Stop the car.

01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:35.640
- The boss is coming.
- Thank you, Manuel.

01:19:35.641 --> 01:19:37.140
"Do you know him?"
- Yes.

01:19:37.141 --> 01:19:39.506
He is my patron, the
owner of this land.

01:19:39.507 --> 01:19:41.015
We're going to have to walk on foot.

01:19:41.016 --> 01:19:43.991
Does he know everything?
You can call the police.

01:19:48.207 --> 01:19:50.140
When do we go horseback riding?

01:19:51.182 --> 01:19:52.482
Not yet.

01:19:55.941 --> 01:19:57.725
I would eat a whole pig.

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:54.681
Good afternoon, Don Ricardo.
Good afternoon, ma'am.

01:20:54.682 --> 01:20:56.349
This is Antonio.

01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:57.966
How are you, sir?

01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:01.591
Good afternoon.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.290
Yes sir?

01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:09.906
I want to know if you could
welcome me to your house?

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:12.306
Not to mention the patron, of course.

01:21:12.307 --> 01:21:14.665
"Did you kill anyone?"
- No.

01:21:15.932 --> 01:21:18.740
Yes. Writing.

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.632
I'm always writing.

01:21:50.475 --> 01:21:53.725
For many years Neruda has
eaten this same burnt land.

01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:57.050
You must like this bed.

01:21:58.057 --> 01:22:01.265
She would sleep happily
there, hugging her daughter.

01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:09.132
Right now, I just
want you to hold me.

01:22:16.832 --> 01:22:18.825
- Sir.
- Good afternoon.

01:22:23.807 --> 01:22:25.825
- Are you lost?
- No.

01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:29.541
Did not finish

01:22:30.266 --> 01:22:31.800
Do you know where I can...?

01:22:34.307 --> 01:22:35.507
Look.

01:22:37.391 --> 01:22:38.825
Seeing the bike for you.

01:22:39.391 --> 01:22:42.640
Last generation vehicle.
From Germany.

01:22:42.641 --> 01:22:45.931
I'll take you to the
boss, he's got gas.

01:22:45.932 --> 01:22:49.033
I do not need gasoline.

01:22:49.507 --> 01:22:51.157
I need a horse.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.900
Two horses.

01:22:53.725 --> 01:22:56.631
I'm stalking a very
dangerous criminal.

01:22:56.632 --> 01:22:59.890
"And the bike, can I sell it?"
- Of course.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.225
Of course. As long as they come with me.

01:23:04.707 --> 01:23:06.907
This can be very exciting.

01:23:11.541 --> 01:23:13.865
Hello? President?

01:23:13.866 --> 01:23:15.806
Mr. President?

01:23:15.807 --> 01:23:18.307
Yes, it is Peluchonneau, yes.

01:23:19.475 --> 01:23:21.575
We arrest Senator Neruda.

01:23:23.557 --> 01:23:24.975
Come on, quick!

01:23:25.432 --> 01:23:26.732
The boss is coming.

01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:49.640
Dominguez.

01:23:49.641 --> 01:23:53.215
A feudal lord who invented
capitalism on his land.

01:23:53.216 --> 01:23:57.406
There is a secret trail up the mountain
to bring Argentine contraband.

01:23:57.407 --> 01:23:58.850
Hello, sir.

01:23:59.682 --> 01:24:02.850
This is Mr. Monsalve,
a Mapuche chief.

01:24:03.725 --> 01:24:05.975
We are afraid of these people.

01:24:06.932 --> 01:24:09.015
Are you tired, Mr. Ruiz?

01:24:09.016 --> 01:24:11.256
I'll call him Mr. Ruiz.

01:24:11.257 --> 01:24:15.275
I'm Pedro Dominguez,
owner of this shit here.

01:24:15.932 --> 01:24:18.266
On behalf of the President
of the Republic,

01:24:18.267 --> 01:24:20.500
I'm going to arrest
him for treason.

01:24:25.357 --> 01:24:28.230
"You're on my own day."
"Am I on your custom day?"

01:24:28.231 --> 01:24:29.431
It is.

01:24:29.432 --> 01:24:31.974
"Are you going to get me arrested?"
- No, I'll help you.

01:24:31.975 --> 01:24:34.015
Crossing the ridge.

01:24:34.016 --> 01:24:36.931
Many people die there.
I'll help you.

01:24:36.932 --> 01:24:38.765
You do not want to pay taxes.

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:43.181
I'm irritated by this
president you elected.

01:24:43.182 --> 01:24:45.581
He thinks that the state
is an enemy of freedom.

01:24:45.582 --> 01:24:47.765
So why will you help me?

01:24:48.354 --> 01:24:49.908
Yes.

01:24:50.475 --> 01:24:53.182
It is more fun to help
than to call the police.

01:24:54.307 --> 01:24:55.765
More fun?

01:24:55.766 --> 01:24:57.474
Yes, more fun.

01:24:57.475 --> 01:25:01.391
Over his shoulders and soul will
stand the future of the Republic.

01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:08.557
The millionaire is always
smarter than the laws.

01:25:21.357 --> 01:25:22.557
Patron.

01:25:23.266 --> 01:25:26.506
A police officer is here
behind the senator.

01:25:26.507 --> 01:25:29.285
- He wants us to show him the trail.
- What's he like?

01:25:29.775 --> 01:25:32.141
Kind of rough, half idiot.

01:25:36.125 --> 01:25:37.641
Araucania.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.503
A land without a temple.

01:25:41.307 --> 01:25:43.140
Trees and cold.

01:25:43.891 --> 01:25:46.265
It is said that the
conquistadors wept

01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:48.824
When a Mapuche patrol arrived.

01:25:48.825 --> 01:25:51.707
They were more afraid of the
Indians than of the Moors.

01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:55.516
Now it is a land of peace.

01:25:56.307 --> 01:25:59.040
A land of clay and work.

01:25:59.541 --> 01:26:01.183
The poet writes about it.

01:26:02.441 --> 01:26:04.850
The suffering of the
poor inspires him.

01:27:37.457 --> 01:27:39.725
Pablo!

01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:21.057
Hide! Hide!

01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:42.341
Pablo...

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.400
I'm seeing you.

01:28:47.807 --> 01:28:49.382
I hear you gasp.

01:28:59.957 --> 01:29:02.825
The middle one, the fat one.

01:29:04.475 --> 01:29:09.107
I go from the left, you
see from the right.

01:29:10.141 --> 01:29:13.306
I'm going to shoot the horse's
head so I'll die soon.

01:29:13.307 --> 01:29:16.132
You come and grab it.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.581
It's going to be very impressive.

01:29:22.582 --> 01:29:25.056
You think they will not shoot?

01:29:25.057 --> 01:29:26.357
Do not.

01:29:27.641 --> 01:29:30.391
Because the animals
will run scared.

01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:33.775
It's going to be a chain reaction.

01:29:34.391 --> 01:29:35.931
Meanwhile...

01:29:35.932 --> 01:29:38.331
I'll come forward.

01:29:38.332 --> 01:29:40.615
It's good to be a cop, right?

01:29:40.616 --> 01:29:42.325
Right. Let's go.

01:29:48.166 --> 01:29:49.600
I'm sorry, sir.

01:30:22.457 --> 01:30:26.600
The shit of the traitor Gonzales
Videla is me, and I came this far.

01:30:28.182 --> 01:30:31.507
Me, the skinny, the bony.

01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.557
In this white bed, I make a
toast to the last months.

01:30:54.975 --> 01:30:58.100
I only have one bullet,
passionate boar.

01:30:58.932 --> 01:31:03.007
But do not worry.
With the cold, you will not feel it.

01:31:03.008 --> 01:31:04.820
Pablo!

01:31:11.582 --> 01:31:13.432
Why does he come to me?

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:15.400
Are not you afraid?

01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:18.505
Pablo, where are you going?

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:19.806
But he is curious.

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:22.099
Pablo, come on. Pablo!

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:23.432
He wants to see me.

01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:26.550
How could he not see
the end of his story?

01:31:51.041 --> 01:31:52.600
Where are you going, man?

01:31:58.916 --> 01:32:00.316
He gave me a hug.

01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:04.650
Talked to me.

01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.907
And she danced with me.

01:32:10.016 --> 01:32:12.758
I pursued the guide, but I
do not know how to fly.

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.500
I'm far away.

01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:20.191
I can only go back to the
bottom of the earth.

01:32:23.182 --> 01:32:25.950
I lived believing I
was a Peluchonneau.

01:32:26.932 --> 01:32:29.090
Son of a police uniform.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.266
But now...

01:32:34.432 --> 01:32:37.032
I think maybe I was a Neruda.

01:32:38.266 --> 01:32:39.700
A son of the people.

01:32:41.057 --> 01:32:43.407
Maybe my father
lived on his knees,

01:32:44.016 --> 01:32:45.750
With the dirty face.

01:32:47.016 --> 01:32:49.281
Maybe put together four coins

01:32:49.282 --> 01:32:52.232
And paid to sweat the
back of my hand.

01:32:54.932 --> 01:32:56.975
Maybe I'm a son of the wheat.

01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:01.516
Another black head among
millions of black heads.

01:33:02.932 --> 01:33:04.931
But I'm going to die white,

01:33:04.932 --> 01:33:07.475
Because nobody else
persecuted the poet.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:11.432
No one else terrified
him in the snow.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.116
No one else made him
gasp regretfully.

01:33:16.391 --> 01:33:18.758
No one else accompanied
him on his trip.

01:33:21.957 --> 01:33:24.032
It does not matter
that you wrote to me,

01:33:24.782 --> 01:33:27.275
That made me a
secondary character.

01:33:43.957 --> 01:33:45.457
I wrote myself too.

01:33:47.391 --> 01:33:48.866
Lousy way.

01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:52.157
I invented myself without life,

01:33:52.766 --> 01:33:55.675
Alone, without love.

01:33:57.725 --> 01:34:00.232
But the poet invented me furiously,

01:34:00.766 --> 01:34:02.266
Full of wind.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.175
He wrote me to a fabulous death.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.216
A police death.

01:34:14.032 --> 01:34:17.050
Slow, cold.

01:34:18.391 --> 01:34:20.200
With red details,

01:34:21.057 --> 01:34:22.457
With music,

01:34:23.307 --> 01:34:24.865
with animals,

01:34:25.766 --> 01:34:27.166
With trees,

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.000
With poetry.

01:35:43.041 --> 01:35:44.441
Do you know him?

01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:52.300
Do not.

01:35:58.432 --> 01:35:59.632
Yes...

01:36:00.932 --> 01:36:02.365
Yes I know.

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.057
This is my inspector.

01:36:08.266 --> 01:36:09.666
My pursuer.

01:36:11.557 --> 01:36:13.450
My uniform ghost.

01:36:18.307 --> 01:36:20.656
I dream about him and
he dreams about me.

01:36:20.657 --> 01:36:23.265
He watches over me,
knows my back.

01:36:25.516 --> 01:36:27.600
Look what you wrote, officer.

01:36:28.975 --> 01:36:31.182
You wrote the snow
and the horses.

01:36:32.432 --> 01:36:33.990
You raise Me Up.

01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:43.782
Now you do not even feel the cold.

01:36:51.166 --> 01:36:52.566
We have to take him.

01:36:54.682 --> 01:36:56.325
Alert the muleteers.

01:37:12.932 --> 01:37:15.365
I feel the heart
beat of this horse.

01:37:17.225 --> 01:37:19.491
I feel my own heart, too.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.532
Because they did not kill me.

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:26.566
They did not kill me
with a blow to the head.

01:37:27.166 --> 01:37:28.991
- Are you breathing?
- No.

01:37:44.916 --> 01:37:47.931
Mr. Picasso, tell me
what happened to him.

01:37:47.932 --> 01:37:49.890
For almost two years,

01:37:49.891 --> 01:37:54.381
Neruda headed the Chilean
resistance in the clandestine.

01:37:54.382 --> 01:37:58.349
The political police chased
him into the mountains.

01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:01.599
But the poet crossed the Andes,

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.557
Disappeared in the snow
and came to heaven.

01:38:07.225 --> 01:38:10.724
Mr. Neruda, did you write
in the underground?

01:38:10.725 --> 01:38:11.925
Forgiveness?

01:38:11.926 --> 01:38:17.391
Are you afraid that your political
figure will overlap your poetry?

01:38:18.842 --> 01:38:20.042
Do not.

01:38:21.016 --> 01:38:22.833
I'm not afraid.

01:38:23.516 --> 01:38:25.349
It turns out that...

01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:29.932
Sometimes I feel like I'm
freezing in the snow.

01:38:30.641 --> 01:38:33.015
I dream. I dream with this.

01:38:33.016 --> 01:38:36.700
- Cold dead?
- No, dead with one shot.

01:38:37.432 --> 01:38:38.931
There's a man...

01:38:38.932 --> 01:38:42.432
Who was about to kill me.

01:38:43.141 --> 01:38:46.058
"Is he still pursuing you?"
- It's possible.

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:50.407
- Who is it?
"A policeman, miss.

01:38:51.807 --> 01:38:54.807
Maybe he's around, watching us.

01:39:12.875 --> 01:39:14.866
No one will know that I existed.

01:39:18.832 --> 01:39:21.032
Say my name. Say it!

01:39:24.875 --> 01:39:26.275
Say my name.

01:39:28.141 --> 01:39:29.700
Say my name!

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.432
His name was Oscar.

01:39:34.682 --> 01:39:37.056
Oscar Peluchonneau.

01:39:37.057 --> 01:39:40.431
- You said!
- Peluchonneau.

01:39:40.432 --> 01:39:41.765
You said my name!

01:39:41.766 --> 01:39:44.531
Write: Peluchonneau.

01:39:44.532 --> 01:39:47.032
I'm not a secondary character.

01:39:49.141 --> 01:39:53.265
Many men of my country
are in prison,

01:39:53.266 --> 01:39:55.140
Tortured, exiled.

01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:57.100
I'm just one of them.

01:39:57.932 --> 01:40:01.731
Because I've always been
a prisoner with them.

01:40:02.332 --> 01:40:06.556
Why did he do all this?
For your people.

01:40:06.557 --> 01:40:10.265
The poet gave them words
to count their lives.

01:40:10.266 --> 01:40:11.866
Their lives are hard.

01:40:13.266 --> 01:40:16.683
These words made sense to
his terrifying dreams.

01:40:17.641 --> 01:40:21.350
That's why he did everything,
so they could talk.

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:25.225
They can already be quoted as
being trampled by history.

01:40:26.266 --> 01:40:28.640
They do not remember
the poems of love,

01:40:28.641 --> 01:40:30.780
S of the fairy tales.

01:40:31.432 --> 01:40:33.638
Unrecognizable Poems...

01:40:34.225 --> 01:40:36.765
Poems of an imaginary future.

01:40:36.766 --> 01:40:39.806
"I can write the saddest
poem of all tonight..."

01:40:39.807 --> 01:40:43.023
Wonderful!

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.307
Neruda made me eternal.

01:40:48.932 --> 01:40:50.600
Your art gave me life.

01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:00.807
I was from paper...

01:41:02.850 --> 01:41:04.732
And now I am of blood.

01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:28.516
I can write the saddest
poem of all tonight...

01:41:29.305 --> 01:41:35.637
