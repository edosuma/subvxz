WEBVTT

00:01.323 --> 00:03.091
Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie.

00:03.158 --> 00:06.069
Listen, I got to go,
but I'll see you tonight?

00:06.104 --> 00:06.891
Okay.

00:06.959 --> 00:09.404
Bye-bye.

00:09.472 --> 00:11.481
No, you hang up first.

00:12.484 --> 00:14.486
Hello?

00:15.623 --> 00:17.561
Dude, I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend,

00:17.628 --> 00:20.263
but do you have to do all
that lovey-dovey stuff

00:20.331 --> 00:22.231
in front of those of us who don't?

00:22.299 --> 00:23.670
Actually, he might have to.

00:23.737 --> 00:26.473
There's an economic concept
known as a positional good

00:26.541 --> 00:29.210
in which an object is only
valued by the possessor

00:29.277 --> 00:30.910
because it's not possessed by others.

00:30.978 --> 00:32.414
The term was coined in 1976

00:32.482 --> 00:34.647
by economist Fred Hirsch

00:34.715 --> 00:36.049
to replace the more colloquial,

00:36.116 --> 00:38.750
but less precise "neener-neener."

00:38.818 --> 00:39.919
That's not true.

00:39.987 --> 00:41.288
My happiness is not dependent

00:41.356 --> 00:43.756
on my best friend being miserable and alone.

00:43.824 --> 00:44.824
Thank you.

00:44.892 --> 00:46.759
Although, I'd be lying if I said

00:46.827 --> 00:47.760
it wasn't a little bit of a perk.

00:47.828 --> 00:49.095
Who's miserable and alone?

00:49.162 --> 00:49.862
Me.

00:49.930 --> 00:51.029
Oh.

00:51.097 --> 00:52.264
I used to be like that.

00:52.331 --> 00:53.432
Then I got a girlfriend.

00:53.500 --> 00:58.305
In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.

00:58.373 --> 00:59.873
Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing

00:59.941 --> 01:01.008
for your first Valentine's Day?

01:01.075 --> 01:02.776
Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops.

01:02.844 --> 01:06.982
There's a $39.95 lover's
special at P.F. Chang's.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.117
Egg rolls, dumplings,

01:09.185 --> 01:11.486
bottomless wok,
and you get your picture taken

01:11.554 --> 01:14.289
on the big marble horse out front.

01:14.357 --> 01:17.992
Given that Saint Valentine was
a third century Roman priest

01:18.060 --> 01:19.695
who was stoned and beheaded,

01:19.763 --> 01:22.197
wouldn't a more appropriate
celebration of the evening

01:22.265 --> 01:25.835
be taking one's steady gal
to witness a brutal murder?

01:25.903 --> 01:29.505
I understand your point, but given a choice,

01:29.573 --> 01:31.607
Jews always go with Chinese food.

01:33.743 --> 01:34.877
Well, if anyone's interested,

01:34.944 --> 01:36.344
I'll be spending this Valentine's Day

01:36.412 --> 01:38.380
the same way I spend every Valentine's Day.

01:38.447 --> 01:40.214
Buying a rotisserie chicken
from the supermarket,

01:40.282 --> 01:42.049
taking it home, standing over the sink

01:42.117 --> 01:43.884
and eating it out of the package

01:43.952 --> 01:45.886
with my bare hands like an animal.

01:45.954 --> 01:49.856
Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse,

01:49.924 --> 01:51.825
one asinine comment,

01:51.893 --> 01:52.894
one lonely

01:52.961 --> 01:54.295
man and his chicken.

01:54.363 --> 01:55.630
And let's see. Who's left?

01:55.698 --> 01:57.699
Oh, that's right. My plans.

02:01.738 --> 02:03.506
Isn't anyone going to ask?

02:03.574 --> 02:05.308
Fine, tell us you're going
to have sex with Penny.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.010
That's not what I was going to tell you.

02:07.078 --> 02:08.345
It's okay.

02:08.412 --> 02:10.314
<i>I don't mind hearing about
your sex life.</i>

02:10.382 --> 02:11.749
It's his that bugs me.

02:13.651 --> 02:16.453
Guess who the university
is sending to Switzerland

02:16.521 --> 02:18.955
to attend a conference and
see the CERN supercollider

02:19.023 --> 02:20.757
on February 14?

02:20.824 --> 02:22.859
Professor Norton, although, God knows why.

02:22.926 --> 02:24.427
He hasn't published anything of note

02:24.494 --> 02:26.362
since he won that Nobel Prize.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.030
Actually, Professor Norton can't make it.

02:28.098 --> 02:29.531
He threw his back out rock climbing.

02:29.599 --> 02:32.401
I heard he threw his back out
climbing on his new girlfriend.

02:32.469 --> 02:34.136
The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?

02:34.204 --> 02:34.871
That's the one.

02:34.939 --> 02:36.273
In any case,

02:36.340 --> 02:38.475
they're asking me to fill in for him.

02:38.543 --> 02:41.378
In Switzerland or with the bi
g-boobed weather girl?

02:41.446 --> 02:43.214
Switzerland.

02:43.282 --> 02:45.216
And I get to bring a guest!

02:45.284 --> 02:47.085
Oh, man! No way, dude!

02:47.153 --> 02:48.253
This is incredible!

02:48.321 --> 02:49.754
I'm so happy,

02:49.822 --> 02:52.458
I'm not even going to question
their judgment in picking you.

02:52.526 --> 02:55.228
I'm just going to run
home and start packing.

02:57.131 --> 03:00.134
Why wouldn't you take Penny?

03:00.201 --> 03:03.805
<i>I am taking Penny.</i>

03:03.872 --> 03:05.573
Oh.

03:05.641 --> 03:07.809
Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation

03:07.877 --> 03:09.277
when you get home.

03:10.746 --> 03:14.282
âTª Our whole universe was in a hot,
dense state âTª

03:14.350 --> 03:17.586
âTª Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! âTª

03:17.654 --> 03:19.655
âTª The Earth began to cool âTª

03:19.723 --> 03:22.692
âTª The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools âTª

03:22.760 --> 03:24.194
<i>âTª We built the Wall âTª âTª We built the
pyramids âTª</i>

03:24.261 --> 03:27.096
âTª Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery âTª

03:27.164 --> 03:29.065
âTª That all started with a big bang âTª

03:29.133 --> 03:30.767
<i>âTª Bang! âTª</i>

03:38.960 --> 03:40.360
(knocking)

03:40.428 --> 03:41.728
Sheldon, you got a minute?

03:41.796 --> 03:43.431
Of course, my good friend.

03:43.498 --> 03:44.632
Come in.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.068
Help me out.

03:47.136 --> 03:50.372
<i>Which ski hat says aprÃ¨s
supercollider?</i>

03:52.709 --> 03:55.344
Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland.

03:55.412 --> 03:56.846
Well, of course you are.

03:56.914 --> 03:58.214
Who else would you take?

03:58.282 --> 03:59.348
Penny.

03:59.416 --> 04:00.516
What?

04:00.583 --> 04:01.817
That's absurd.

04:01.885 --> 04:04.887
Penny has no interest in
subatomic particle research.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.689
Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day.

04:07.757 --> 04:09.891
We can go sightseeing and skiing

04:09.958 --> 04:12.260
and make love in front of a roaring fire

04:12.327 --> 04:14.895
in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.

04:14.963 --> 04:19.733
But Penny has no interest in
subatomic particle research.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.002
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

04:22.070 --> 04:23.037
Sorry?

04:23.105 --> 04:24.238
I've been dreaming

04:24.306 --> 04:26.107
about going to the Large Hadron Collider

04:26.175 --> 04:27.743
since I was nine years old.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.112
Yeah, well, I've been dreaming
about spending Valentine's Day

04:30.180 --> 04:32.782
with a girl since I was six.

04:32.850 --> 04:35.018
Shame on you!

04:35.086 --> 04:38.589
That's no dream for a scientist!

04:39.958 --> 04:41.759
Okay, what's the big surprise?

04:41.826 --> 04:43.427
Just a minute.

04:43.494 --> 04:46.363
This tray contains clues

04:46.431 --> 04:50.000
as to what you and I are going
to be doing on Valentine's Day.

04:50.068 --> 04:52.302
Oh. Wow. Okay.

04:52.370 --> 04:53.637
Let's see.

04:53.704 --> 04:55.839
We've got, uh, milk chocolate,

04:55.940 --> 04:59.275
Swiss cheese, fondue.

04:59.343 --> 05:02.279
My lactose-intolerant boyfriend
is going to eat all this.

05:02.347 --> 05:04.381
Then I'm going to climb on his back

05:04.449 --> 05:06.449
and rocket to the moon?

05:10.154 --> 05:11.955
No.

05:13.124 --> 05:15.592
But it does involve air travel.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.594
Okay, um...

05:18.662 --> 05:22.465
<i>let me slice this Swiss cheese</i>

05:22.533 --> 05:24.867
<i>with my Swiss army knife,</i>

05:24.935 --> 05:27.269
and then you can wash it down with a cup

05:27.337 --> 05:31.439
<i>of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.</i>

05:31.507 --> 05:34.576
Okay, I'm starting to
think Swiss is key here.

05:34.643 --> 05:36.744
Uh-huh.

05:36.812 --> 05:39.481
We're going to Disneyland
and ride the Matterhorn?

05:42.185 --> 05:44.119
How does that involve air travel?

05:44.187 --> 05:49.090
<i>We're going to Disney World and
ride the Matterhorn?</i>

05:49.158 --> 05:50.658
No.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.294
Okay, sweetie, this started out fun,

05:52.362 --> 05:53.796
but I'm over it.

05:53.863 --> 05:56.666
We're going to Switzerland

05:56.734 --> 05:59.002
to see the CERN supercollider!

06:00.938 --> 06:03.339
And ski. We'll also go skiing.

06:03.407 --> 06:05.942
We're going skiing in Switzerland?!

06:06.009 --> 06:08.011
Well, you'll ski, I'll fall, but, yeah,

06:08.078 --> 06:11.046
we will be in Switzerland
for Valentine's Day.

06:11.114 --> 06:12.982
Oh, my God, Leonard!

06:13.050 --> 06:14.784
That's incredible!

06:14.851 --> 06:16.285
SHELDON: Not so fast.

06:16.353 --> 06:17.653
You might want to hold off

06:17.721 --> 06:19.655
on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.

06:19.723 --> 06:21.224
Rabe-what-ly?

06:21.292 --> 06:22.558
Rabeliechtli.

06:22.626 --> 06:23.893
It means turnip light

06:23.961 --> 06:25.561
and refers to a traditional lantern

06:25.629 --> 06:26.963
hand-carved from a root vegetable

06:27.030 --> 06:28.965
and used to celebrate
certain Swiss festivals.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.533
Which you will not be celebrating

06:30.601 --> 06:33.503
because A: these festivals
occur in the fall;

06:33.571 --> 06:34.971
and B:

06:35.039 --> 06:37.641
you will not be going to Switzerland.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.276
Sheldon, we've been through this.

06:39.343 --> 06:40.810
I'm taking Penny.

06:40.878 --> 06:41.978
Afraid not.

06:42.046 --> 06:43.146
Do you recognize this?

06:43.214 --> 06:45.148
Not the roommate agreement.

06:45.216 --> 06:47.049
Indeed, the roommate agreement.

06:47.117 --> 06:49.852
I call your attention
to the Friendship Rider

06:49.920 --> 06:51.687
in Appendix C: Future Commitments.

06:51.755 --> 06:54.689
"Number 37: in the event
one friend is ever invited

06:54.757 --> 06:56.758
"to visit the Large Hadron Collider,

06:56.825 --> 06:58.426
"now under construction in Switzerland,

06:58.494 --> 07:00.896
he shall invite the other
friend to accompany him."

07:00.963 --> 07:02.497
Oh, for God's sakes.

07:02.565 --> 07:05.234
You actually put that in an agreement?

07:05.302 --> 07:07.103
Yeah. We also put in what happens

07:07.170 --> 07:09.005
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant,

07:09.072 --> 07:10.740
or if one of us gets superpowers,

07:10.808 --> 07:13.343
or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.

07:13.411 --> 07:16.546
He can't kill me, even if I turn.

07:16.614 --> 07:20.351
Is there anything in there about
if one of you gets a girlfriend?

07:20.418 --> 07:22.853
No, that seemed a little farfetched.

07:25.523 --> 07:28.591
Sheldon, do you really
expect to enforce this?

07:28.659 --> 07:29.792
I've lived up

07:29.860 --> 07:31.460
to all my commitments under the agreement.

07:31.528 --> 07:33.862
At least once a day I ask how you are,

07:33.930 --> 07:35.330
even though I simply don't care.

07:35.398 --> 07:36.698
I no longer

07:36.766 --> 07:39.801
stage spontaneous biohazard
drills after 10:00 p.m.

07:39.868 --> 07:43.404
And I abandoned my goal to
master Tuvan throat singing.

07:43.472 --> 07:45.673
Okay, I know I shouldn't ask,
but what is...? No.

07:45.741 --> 07:47.742
(low, two-toned vocalizing)

07:54.250 --> 07:57.686
I'd be much further along if
I'd been allowed to practice.

07:57.753 --> 07:59.221
Look, Sheldon,

07:59.289 --> 08:00.622
I know it's in the agreement,

08:00.690 --> 08:03.959
and if you turn into a zombie,
I promise I will not kill you.

08:04.027 --> 08:06.095
In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains.

08:06.163 --> 08:08.197
But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.

08:08.265 --> 08:09.699
Is that your final decision?

08:09.767 --> 08:10.700
It is.

08:10.768 --> 08:13.670
Very well.

08:14.706 --> 08:16.708
It's not over, is it?

08:16.809 --> 08:18.810
What do you think?

08:18.878 --> 08:21.612
(low, two-toned vocalizing)

08:23.000 --> 08:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:31.824 --> 08:34.859
Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh?

08:37.794 --> 08:40.096
Think it's gonna rain?

08:41.732 --> 08:43.466
Instead of underpants,

08:43.534 --> 08:45.835
I covered my crotch with
potato salad this morning.

08:45.902 --> 08:47.136
Thoughts?

08:48.571 --> 08:50.972
Okay, I know what'll cheer you up.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.108
Let's play one of your driving games.

08:53.175 --> 08:55.743
All right.

08:55.811 --> 08:57.445
This game is called Traitors.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.315
I will name three historical figures,

09:01.383 --> 09:02.650
you put them in order

09:02.718 --> 09:04.452
of the heinousness of their betrayal.

09:04.520 --> 09:09.190
Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr.
Leonard Hofstadter.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.693
You really think I belong with
Benedict Arnold and Judas?

09:12.761 --> 09:13.861
You're right.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.663
Judas had the decency to hang himself

09:15.731 --> 09:16.831
after what he did.

09:16.899 --> 09:18.033
Come on, Sheldon.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.001
Can't you at least try to understand

09:20.069 --> 09:21.803
how much this means to me?

09:23.005 --> 09:25.440
Round two: Leonard Hofstadter,

09:25.507 --> 09:28.543
Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.844
Rupert Murdoch?

09:29.912 --> 09:33.047
<i>He owns Fox, and they
cancelled Firefly.</i>

09:34.583 --> 09:38.753
Hint: he and Darth Vader are tied for #2.

09:42.424 --> 09:44.558
I'm sorry I couldn't
hang with you last night.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.027
I had a date with Bernadette.

09:46.094 --> 09:47.228
I know.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.163
I saw the Tweet.

09:49.231 --> 09:50.731
So, what did you end up doing?

09:50.799 --> 09:51.899
Not much.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.367
Nuked a burrito. Oh.

09:53.435 --> 09:55.870
Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi
that your bowels would loosen

09:55.937 --> 09:58.005
and your penis would
droop like a willow tree.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.540
You seen Sheldon?

10:00.608 --> 10:02.709
No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?

10:02.777 --> 10:04.710
Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him.

10:04.778 --> 10:05.878
I mean, come on.

10:05.946 --> 10:07.880
What would you guys do if you were me?

10:07.948 --> 10:10.316
I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.

10:10.383 --> 10:11.484
Seriously?

10:11.551 --> 10:12.651
Absolutely.

10:12.719 --> 10:13.885
And I'd leave him there.

10:21.259 --> 10:24.229
What the hell is that?

10:24.296 --> 10:26.264
Uh, let's see.

10:26.332 --> 10:29.040
Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.

10:51.768 --> 10:53.103
Morning, old chum.

10:53.271 --> 10:54.604
What's going on?

10:54.672 --> 10:56.440
I've made you breakfast.

10:56.508 --> 10:58.442
Juice, coffee,

10:58.510 --> 11:00.444
and pancakes in the shape of some

11:00.512 --> 11:02.347
of your favorite fictional characters.

11:02.414 --> 11:04.382
See, here's Frodo.

11:04.450 --> 11:06.551
You made Frodo pancakes?

11:06.619 --> 11:09.621
Yeah, I used coconut shavings
to do the hair on his feet.

11:09.689 --> 11:13.058
If you need to void your
bladder before eating,

11:13.125 --> 11:15.493
I can keep them warm with this beret

11:15.561 --> 11:16.594
that I thoroughly laundered

11:16.662 --> 11:18.404
and pressed into service as a pancake cozy.

11:20.191 --> 11:22.131
Why are you doing this?

11:22.166 --> 11:25.191
It's by way of an apology
for my recent behavior.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.676
I've had some time

11:26.711 --> 11:29.076
to reflect and I've come to realize

11:29.111 --> 11:31.263
that friendship is not an aggregation

11:31.298 --> 11:32.565
of written agreements.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.324
It's a result of two people

11:34.359 --> 11:36.509
respecting and caring for each other.

11:36.544 --> 11:37.919
Butterscotch scone?

11:39.780 --> 11:40.554
Thanks.

11:42.573 --> 11:43.697
It's good.

11:43.732 --> 11:46.362
What you're tasting is
respect and affection.

11:47.262 --> 11:49.517
And about a pound of Crisco.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.569
After you've finished breakfast,

11:52.604 --> 11:54.118
I thought we could spend the day

11:54.153 --> 11:56.192
<i>watching the final season
of Babylon 5</i>

11:56.227 --> 11:57.599
with director commentary.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.288
<i>You hate Babylon 5.</i>

11:59.323 --> 12:01.608
I do. It fails as drama/science fiction,

12:01.643 --> 12:02.945
and it's hopelessly derivative.

12:03.479 --> 12:05.726
But you like it, and you're my friend.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.850
Okay, great.

12:10.653 --> 12:13.118
Still not taking you to Switzerland.

12:13.153 --> 12:14.031
Drat.

12:18.150 --> 12:20.033
No Frodo for you.

12:24.803 --> 12:26.916
Hello.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.743
***

12:29.769 --> 12:31.899
I believe you know why I'm here.

12:31.934 --> 12:34.470
Well, I always figured it was to study us,

12:34.505 --> 12:35.597
discover our weaknesses,

12:35.632 --> 12:37.603
and report back to your alien overlords.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.143
****

12:41.855 --> 12:43.102
Extraordinary intelligence

12:43.137 --> 12:45.071
might well appear extraterrestrial to you,

12:45.106 --> 12:47.747
but let me be more specific.

12:47.782 --> 12:50.691
I believe you know why I'm
here in the laundry room.

12:50.726 --> 12:53.514
Better acoustics for your throat singing?

12:54.928 --> 13:00.800
(low, two-toned vocalizing)

13:01.506 --> 13:03.160
It's actually not bad.

13:04.109 --> 13:07.299
But my true purpose in being here

13:07.334 --> 13:11.380
will be revealed in this brief
PowerPoint presentation.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.427
Lights.

13:22.124 --> 13:24.935
Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD,
should go to Switzerland

13:24.970 --> 13:26.621
to see the CERN supercollider:

13:26.656 --> 13:29.154
a PowerPoint presentation
by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.

13:29.189 --> 13:31.899
Oh, for God's sake.

13:32.876 --> 13:35.545
Here we have a highly gifted researcher

13:35.580 --> 13:37.134
in the field of particle physics

13:37.169 --> 13:38.967
whose work has brought him to the precipice

13:39.002 --> 13:41.678
of forever changing mankind's
understanding of the universe.

13:41.713 --> 13:43.471
AKA me.

13:44.387 --> 13:46.571
And here we have a waitress

13:46.606 --> 13:48.091
brushing her teeth with her finger.

13:49.355 --> 13:51.429
AKA you.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.161
I'm sorry.

13:53.196 --> 13:54.637
Is this supposed to be buttering me up?

13:54.638 --> 13:57.268
****

13:57.303 --> 14:00.454
This is the Large Hadron Collider

14:00.489 --> 14:01.904
at CERN in Switzerland,

14:01.939 --> 14:04.686
the product of decades of
planning and construction.

14:04.721 --> 14:06.908
It is a mecca for physicists the world over.

14:06.943 --> 14:10.391
This is Bath and Body Works

14:10.426 --> 14:12.044
on Colorado Boulevard.

14:12.079 --> 14:14.509
They sell scented soaps and lotions,

14:14.544 --> 14:15.951
some of which contain glitter.

14:15.986 --> 14:19.264
Now, let's see if we can
match the individual

14:19.299 --> 14:21.448
to the appropriate destination.

14:21.483 --> 14:22.982
O- kay.

14:23.017 --> 14:24.074
Show's over.

14:24.109 --> 14:25.171
No, it's not.

14:25.206 --> 14:26.794
I've got five more slides.

14:26.829 --> 14:29.121
Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision.

14:29.156 --> 14:31.662
He invited me to Switzerland,
and I intend to go.

14:35.189 --> 14:36.679
Very well.

14:37.580 --> 14:39.552
Enjoy yourself.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.819
You're going to be in the
presence of something

14:41.854 --> 14:43.833
that I've dreamed of seeing for decades.

14:44.953 --> 14:46.379
I just hope you'll be able to appreciate

14:46.414 --> 14:50.037
the magnitude of where you
are and what it represents.

14:52.167 --> 14:54.408
I'll talk to Leonard.

14:55.596 --> 14:57.176
You will?

14:57.211 --> 14:58.405
Yes.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.040
If it means that much to you, you should go.

15:01.075 --> 15:04.344
Oh, Penny, thank you!

15:05.508 --> 15:07.931
You're welcome.

15:07.966 --> 15:09.376
Since I rarely hug,

15:09.411 --> 15:11.977
I'm relying on your expertise
regarding duration.

15:13.155 --> 15:14.371
I think we're there.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.743
Bye-bye.

15:21.886 --> 15:22.906
You know what?

15:22.941 --> 15:24.574
Even though I don't have a girlfriend,

15:24.609 --> 15:26.575
I can still have a good
time on Valentine's Day.

15:26.610 --> 15:28.444
Trust me, you can't. I've tried.

15:29.335 --> 15:31.793
No, no, no, I'm going to have a "me" day.

15:31.828 --> 15:34.679
First I'm going to go to one
of those spas in Koreatown,

15:34.714 --> 15:36.441
take a steam and get a massage.

15:36.476 --> 15:40.310
Then I'm going to stop at a pet
store and get licked by puppies.

15:43.047 --> 15:44.746
Sheldon, I need to talk to you.

15:44.781 --> 15:46.193
All right, my friend.

15:46.228 --> 15:48.306
Would you like some cholermus?

15:48.341 --> 15:50.101
Some what? Cholermus.

15:50.136 --> 15:51.965
It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.224
I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system

15:54.259 --> 15:56.122
for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.

15:57.185 --> 15:59.784
You're not going to Switzerland!

15:59.819 --> 16:01.268
Oh, but I am.

16:01.303 --> 16:02.960
Didn't Penny tell you the good news?

16:02.995 --> 16:04.621
She told me that you went behind my back

16:04.656 --> 16:06.664
to guilt her into letting
you go instead of her.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.871
Yes, that good news.

16:09.649 --> 16:11.887
Well, forget it.
I was the one who was invited.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.369
I get to decide who goes with me,

16:13.404 --> 16:15.267
and it's Penny, not you!

16:15.302 --> 16:16.760
Howard, could you lower the lights?

16:16.761 --> 16:19.020
I have a short PowerPoint presentation.

16:19.055 --> 16:21.566
I don't need to see your presentation.

16:21.601 --> 16:22.836
This discussion is over!

16:22.871 --> 16:25.510
That's a somewhat ambiguous response.

16:25.545 --> 16:26.395
Am I going or not?

16:27.460 --> 16:28.912
Sheldon, at this point,

16:28.947 --> 16:31.795
I would go by myself
before I would take you.

16:31.830 --> 16:32.815
Really?

16:32.850 --> 16:33.874
Yeah, really.

16:33.875 --> 16:37.376
****

16:37.411 --> 16:38.711
From this moment forward,

16:38.746 --> 16:42.246
we can be roommates,
but we will no longer be friends.

16:42.281 --> 16:44.151
I'm sorry you feel that way.

16:44.186 --> 16:45.773
I don't think you're fully aware

16:45.808 --> 16:48.457
of the ramifications here, Leonard. (sighs)

16:48.492 --> 16:50.369
Why don't you enlighten me?

16:50.404 --> 16:53.368
With the friendship clause of
our roommate agreement nullified

16:53.403 --> 16:55.622
you are no longer entitled to accompany me

16:55.657 --> 16:58.085
to go swimming at Bill Gates'
house should I be invited.

17:03.294 --> 17:05.570
Ooh, that's gotta sting.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.510
Just think, this time tomorrow

17:10.545 --> 17:12.153
we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland

17:12.188 --> 17:14.096
for our first Valentine's Day.

17:14.131 --> 17:15.186
I know!

17:15.222 --> 17:16.622
I went shopping today

17:16.656 --> 17:18.987
and bought special undies for the occasion.

17:19.256 --> 17:21.402
Thermal? 'Cause it's gonna be cold.

17:21.436 --> 17:24.213
Think it through, Leonard.

17:25.205 --> 17:27.113
Oh! Oh!

17:27.147 --> 17:27.998
(both laugh)

17:29.151 --> 17:30.001
(sneezes)

17:30.036 --> 17:31.229
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

17:32.004 --> 17:33.100
Or as they say in Switzerland,

17:33.135 --> 17:34.820
<i>gesundheit.</i>

17:36.960 --> 17:38.255
You getting a cold?

17:38.290 --> 17:40.401
No, no, it's probably just allergies.

17:42.612 --> 17:43.748
Do you want an allergy pill?

17:43.783 --> 17:44.668
'Cause I have 'em all.

17:44.703 --> 17:46.194
Prescription, nonprescription,

17:46.229 --> 17:47.919
foreign, domestic, experimental.

17:49.161 --> 17:50.536
Do any of them work?

17:50.537 --> 17:52.818
******

17:54.045 --> 17:56.380
(blowing)

17:58.877 --> 18:02.272
(Penny vomiting)

18:03.474 --> 18:04.826
Penny?

18:05.231 --> 18:07.494
(toilet flushing)

18:07.529 --> 18:08.341
You okay?

18:08.376 --> 18:10.675
Did that sound okay to you?

18:11.680 --> 18:14.132
Do not come in here!

18:14.684 --> 18:16.657
What's going on?

18:16.692 --> 18:17.829
I'm having a tea party.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.450
What do you think's going on?

18:19.485 --> 18:21.873
(hocking loogie)

18:22.569 --> 18:24.737
I think I might have the flu.

18:24.772 --> 18:27.389
(vomiting)

18:27.424 --> 18:29.481
Or the plague.

18:31.071 --> 18:33.705
Well, our plane leaves at 9:00 a.m.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.266
Do you think you'll feel better by then?

18:35.301 --> 18:38.117
(vomiting)

18:38.152 --> 18:38.948
Yep.

18:38.983 --> 18:40.626
'Cause I'm gonna be dead.

18:44.429 --> 18:45.695
Hey, Sheldon?

18:46.540 --> 18:48.184
Listen, Penny is pretty sick

18:48.219 --> 18:50.507
and she's not going to be
able to go to Switzerland.

18:50.542 --> 18:54.206
So if you're still interested,
you're welcome to come.

18:54.241 --> 18:58.770
(vomiting, coughing)

18:58.805 --> 19:01.908
(toilet flushing)

19:01.943 --> 19:03.827
Great.

19:03.862 --> 19:05.658
I'll start packing.

19:06.326 --> 19:08.607
In a minute.

19:12.427 --> 19:15.500
Oh, look, it's the cholermus.

19:15.535 --> 19:18.138
(vomiting)

19:27.370 --> 19:29.222
Here's your soup.

19:29.257 --> 19:30.485
Chicken? Yes.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.498
<i>With the little stars? Yes.</i>

19:32.533 --> 19:34.333
Heated to 180 degrees?

19:35.127 --> 19:38.552
*******

19:38.587 --> 19:40.701
You don't have to be mean.

19:40.736 --> 19:42.102
I'm sick.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.689
Yeah, well, I'm sick, too.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.019
Not my problem.

19:47.512 --> 19:49.804
I just don't understand
how this happened to me.

19:49.839 --> 19:51.859
I'm scrupulous about my hygiene.

19:51.894 --> 19:53.876
I regularly disinfect my hands,

19:53.911 --> 19:57.504
and I avoid contact with other
people on general principle.

19:58.517 --> 20:00.596
I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.

20:03.115 --> 20:04.916
Oh, Penny, thank you!

20:06.439 --> 20:09.195
(in slow motion): You're welcome.

20:13.927 --> 20:16.638
It's you!

20:16.673 --> 20:18.149
I touched you!

20:18.184 --> 20:21.392
Happy Valentine's Day.

20:30.914 --> 20:34.072
Oh, my goodness, look at this room!

20:34.107 --> 20:36.112
(gasps) Champagne!

20:36.147 --> 20:37.825
Roses! Oh!

20:37.860 --> 20:40.574
And little chocolates!

20:40.609 --> 20:44.122
This is going to be the
best Valentine's Day ever.

20:45.042 --> 20:48.140
Yeah, I forgot about all this.

20:48.512 --> 20:50.801
But I never will.
