00:00.876 --> 00:02.252
NARRATOR:

00:02.252 --> 00:04.505
Where have you been? I've been looking for you.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.089
If you must know, I overslept.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.843
I'd love to go out again. Is tonight too soon?

00:08.843 --> 00:10.803
Let me check my calendar-- Yep, I'm free.

00:10.803 --> 00:13.597
You will not determine the type of lawyer I want to be.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.974
What's that supposed to mean?

00:14.974 --> 00:17.017
It means I'm willing to say I owe you one.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.602
Make an enemy of me... or not.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.312
That's the best you're going to get.

00:20.312 --> 00:22.314
I never sent the documents over.

00:22.314 --> 00:23.899
You shitting me? It's my fault.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.901
I'll take the bullet. They're not gonna give a shit

00:25.901 --> 00:28.445
whose fault this is. You must be out of your mind.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.947
Scottie, I'm in trouble here.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.949
I need you to help me. I'm sorry, Harvey,

00:31.949 --> 00:34.284
but I've said yes to you to many times.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.495
A year after I stopped with my therapist,

00:36.495 --> 00:38.288
I started seeing her. I'm guessing

00:38.288 --> 00:40.708
it didn't work out. It was complicated.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.502
Did Donna have anything to do with that complication?

00:49.008 --> 00:51.426
SCOTTIE: Still drinking sidewalk

00:49.008 --> 00:51.426
coffee, I see.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.595
That's because it's the best in the city.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.139
Don't know about that, but their croissants are good.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.141
When do you cross town for a croissant?

00:58.141 --> 01:00.060
I had a meeting nearby and wanted one.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.311
I'd ask you how you are,

01:01.311 --> 01:03.480
but I saw the announcement in the<i> Journal.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:05.315
Louis as Managing Partner. How?

01:05.315 --> 01:07.275
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.987
Have anything to do with the two new names on the wall?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.446
One I've never heard of before.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.865
Just because you never heard of her

01:12.865 --> 01:14.241
doesn't mean she's not a badass.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.910
What's that mean? The type of work

01:15.910 --> 01:17.118
that Samantha Wheeler did

01:17.118 --> 01:18.787
before she got her name on the wall

01:18.787 --> 01:20.372
didn't show up in the<i> Journal.</i>

01:20.372 --> 01:21.874
Get to why you're here.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.500
This is no chance encounter.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.169
I had a meeting nearby. I think that meeting's with me

01:26.169 --> 01:28.463
because I bet you have a case against us.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.757
Well, I'm sorry, Scottie,

01:29.757 --> 01:31.675
I'm not gonna let you get in my head.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.052
We both know if I wanted to,

01:33.052 --> 01:34.803
I could live in your head rent-free.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.890
It makes you feel any better, I don't have a case against you.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.767
Well, it's good to see you though.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.561
Maybe next time it won't be by chance?

01:48.483 --> 01:50.485
Katrina.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.863
Samantha, are you having a nice--

01:52.863 --> 01:54.281
Mind if we skip the chitchat?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.824
I'd like nothing more. Great.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.367
I need your help with something.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.369
With what? With getting out of a deal

01:59.369 --> 02:01.538
I negotiated for a mobile payment app

02:01.538 --> 02:04.917
with our client's credit card provider.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.835
But this is a three-year deal

02:06.835 --> 02:08.462
and you're only three months in.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.006
That's what makes it fun. Let me get this straight.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.591
You want out of this contract,

02:12.591 --> 02:14.676
you don't have any legal grounds to do it.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.845
You think I can fix your problem for you?

02:16.845 --> 02:18.931
If I can find a reason to pay into a trust

02:18.931 --> 02:21.308
instead of to them directly, then we can squeeze,

02:21.308 --> 02:24.019
make them take a buyout. If you already have that idea,

02:24.019 --> 02:26.021
why come to me? I need precedent,

02:26.021 --> 02:28.189
and legal minutia is one of your specialties.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.150
In other words, I owe you. You sure do.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.860
Better come up with something fast,

02:31.860 --> 02:34.863
because I need something by noon.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.863
Noon

02:34.863 --> 02:36.698
Because I already started paying into

02:36.698 --> 02:39.242
that trust yesterday, and their douche bag attorney

02:39.242 --> 02:40.702
moved the hearing up to today.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.329
Unless you want to owe me twice,

02:42.329 --> 02:45.707
stop asking me questions and start getting me some answers.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.673
Harvey, you needed to see me?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.133
I need to know what case I got

02:54.133 --> 02:55.759
coming up against Scottie.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.845
As far as I know, you don't have any cases

02:57.845 --> 02:59.930
pending against Scottie. Then look again,

02:59.930 --> 03:03.224
because I just ran into her at the coffee cart.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.184
There's no way that was a coincidence.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.604
I don't know, Harvey. The Scottie I remember

03:07.604 --> 03:09.982
would never come at you from the side like that.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.900
I thought the point was you two enjoyed

03:11.900 --> 03:13.401
attacking each other directly.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.987
Well, things change.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.781
It looks like she's operating out of a new playbook.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.283
If she is coming after us, we need to be prepared.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.077
Why don't you drop what you're doing

03:22.077 --> 03:24.412
and figure out what case she's got against us.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.413
Consider it dropped.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.633
LOUIS: Hey, Doc, listen,

03:34.297 --> 03:36.633
before we get going,

03:36.633 --> 03:38.468
I may need an hour and 15--

03:38.468 --> 03:39.720
Holy shit, what's wrong?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.304
Nothing, Louis,

03:41.304 --> 03:44.058
but I'm afraid I'm going to have to postpone our session.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.893
Are you okay? If you need something,

03:45.893 --> 03:47.519
there isn't anything I wouldn't--

03:47.519 --> 03:49.437
I'm fine, Louis. It's a personal issue.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.981
I would rather not discuss it.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.358
I've known you years. I've never seen that look.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.776
Me walking out without knowing

03:54.776 --> 03:56.611
what's going on isn't gonna happen.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.197
Then if you must know,

03:58.197 --> 03:59.322
it's a legal matter.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.699
What kind of legal matter? I don't want to talk

04:00.699 --> 04:02.076
about it.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.244
That's too bad. I can't represent you

04:04.244 --> 04:05.996
if you don't tell me what happened.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.664
Louis, it's out of the question.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.875
My personal life has nothing to do with you.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.793
Nothing to do

04:11.793 --> 04:14.254
I care about you. I'm a lawyer.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.798
If you're in some trouble-- Louis, please.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.342
This is not that serious.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.887
Just not every day I'm served with papers.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.598
So if you will be so kind as to reschedule,

04:24.598 --> 04:26.934
I would greatly appreciate it.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.603
Okay, Stan.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.772
I'll see you next week.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.484
Mr. Kendrick, I'd like to thank you for sitting down with us.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.027
Your situation's been difficult.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.821
The situation is my wife died.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.240
Difficult doesn't cover it. Of course not.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.951
Can we just get on with it?

05:25.951 --> 05:28.411
We made a few amendments to your offer.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.956
As you can see, I've red-lined the sections--

05:30.956 --> 05:33.208
Hang on. This says we admit it was our fault.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.918
It was your fault. ALEX: It wasn't.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.879
Tragic as this death was, we're under no obligation to pay.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.673
Why are you? TONY: It doesn't matter.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.883
I'm not admitting something that isn't true.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.760
ALEX: Tony-- No, my machines regulate

05:43.760 --> 05:45.220
insulin better than any human.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.181
I've dedicated my life to helping people.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.016
I'm not gonna let them say I didn't.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.392
Well, I dedicated my life to caring for my wife.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.312
She's dead now because of your machine.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.771
There's no need for hostility,

05:54.771 --> 05:56.773
so let's calm down, go back to the offer--

05:56.773 --> 05:58.357
Think I care about your offer?

05:58.357 --> 06:00.319
No amount is going to bring my wife back.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.487
I care about preventing this from happening

06:02.487 --> 06:03.989
to someone else, and that means

06:03.989 --> 06:06.241
making you take responsibility. Mr. Kendrick--

06:06.241 --> 06:07.659
That's enough. A woman is dead

06:07.659 --> 06:09.368
because of your client's product.

06:09.368 --> 06:12.206
If he won't admit it, we'll make a jury admit it for him.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.415
This is our final offer. Take it.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.459
Or we'll see you in court.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.093
Ms. Wheeler, looks like you're going to get to pay

06:25.093 --> 06:27.804
into that trust after all, because if they're not here

06:27.804 --> 06:29.890
in the next two minutes-- SCOTTIE: Sorry.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.308
I had a last-minute snafu.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.268
I thought Larry Samuels was on this.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.104
He was, but Larry's who they call when they don't need me.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.564
Dana Scott. Oh.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.566
Heard a lot about you. Have you now?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.318
I actually used to work at your firm

06:41.318 --> 06:43.528
back when there were three names on the wall.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.780
Now there's so many it's hard to keep track.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.575
Well, after this, you'll keep track just fine.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.036
Because you haven't lived up to your obligations,

06:51.036 --> 06:53.288
and according to these six precedents,

06:53.288 --> 06:55.582
we have the right to nullify this entire deal.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.167
You don't have the right to do anything.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.543
You're in violation.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.503
Paying into a trust isn't a violation.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.381
No, but meeting with the competition is.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.299
Don't know what you're talking about.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.800
You didn't know I'd find out.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.387
That snafu, Your Honor, was waiting on confirmation

07:08.387 --> 07:09.804
that Samantha Wheeler

07:09.804 --> 07:11.806
has engaged in a pattern of dirty tricks,

07:11.806 --> 07:14.559
unethical behavior, and borderline illegal activity

07:14.559 --> 07:16.853
all in the name of "representing" her clients.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.521
You're gonna say that about me,

07:18.521 --> 07:20.607
better damn well be able to back it up,

07:20.607 --> 07:22.150
which you can't.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.861
Here are three of Ms. Wheeler's old cases,

07:24.861 --> 07:26.821
and then you'll find payments forced,

07:26.821 --> 07:29.574
settlements withheld, and meetings with the competition

07:29.574 --> 07:31.076
just like she did last week.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.660
How the hell did you get those?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.079
Doesn't like you're denying.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.290
Did you meet with the competition last week?

07:36.290 --> 07:38.750
Your Honor, my past cases have no relevance here.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.044
No, but your answers to my questions do.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.545
Did you meet with them?

07:42.545 --> 07:44.005
Yes, but--

07:44.005 --> 07:46.216
You came into my chambers ready to lie

07:46.216 --> 07:48.260
and cheat and God knows what else,

07:48.260 --> 07:50.137
so you are going to dissolve that trust,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.680
you're gonna pay her client the money you owe them,

07:52.680 --> 07:54.515
and I don't ever want to see you

07:54.515 --> 07:57.394
in my chambers on this case again.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.772
All right, Tony, it's just you and me now.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.608
Tell me you're 100 percent sure this wasn't your machine.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.819
Have anyone in the world test my machines,

08:05.819 --> 08:07.737
every reports gonna say the same thing.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.406
That woman's death wasn't our fault.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.199
Then what else could have caused it?

08:11.199 --> 08:13.243
You heard that man. We're going to trial.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.703
This doesn't have to go to trial, and you know it.

08:15.703 --> 08:19.040
Just like we both know what caused her death.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.251
Shit. Yeah, I know.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.920
It was him, and we're gonna have to prove it.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.714
The question is

08:26.714 --> 08:29.676
when the time comes, are you gonna have the stomach

08:29.676 --> 08:32.637
to do what needs to be done?

08:34.639 --> 08:37.851
LOUIS: No, not right now, Donna.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.851
I'm in the middle of something.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.894
I'm in the middle of something for Harvey.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.647
These quarterly reports aren't gonna sign themselves.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.607
Well, put them right over there.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.568
"Boyd versus Lipschitz"?

08:47.568 --> 08:49.737
Lipschitz as in Dr. Lipschitz? Yes.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.740
He's being sued, and he tried to make it like it was nothing,

08:52.740 --> 08:54.409
but I pulled his legal filing and--

08:54.409 --> 08:55.952
It's not nothing. No, it's not.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.246
One of his patients is a construction foreman,

08:58.246 --> 09:00.623
had a meltdown at work, there was an accident,

09:00.623 --> 09:02.667
put someone in a coma, and now he claims

09:02.667 --> 09:04.294
it only happened because Lipschitz

09:04.294 --> 09:06.213
prescribed the wrong meds. Oh, my God.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.257
Gets worse. Instead of coming to me, he went to Dick Corman.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.634
They lose this case, he could lose his license.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.095
Are you talking about trying to convince Lipschitz

09:14.095 --> 09:16.597
to let you represent him? Yes, you're gonna tell me

09:16.597 --> 09:18.308
it's a bad idea. It's not.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.977
If someone I cared about was in a similar situation,

09:20.977 --> 09:23.855
wild horses wouldn't stop me from trying to protect them.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.690
How could I not support you?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.192
You mean that? Of course I do.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.361
What do you say you help me figure out a way

09:29.361 --> 09:31.654
to convince Stan to let me take his case.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.117
Samantha, how'd it go? I'll tell you how it went.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.536
I got my ass handed to me.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.913
They found out about our meeting with their rival.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.541
What meeting? You didn't tell me about any meeting.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.791
I didn't tell anyone.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.420
There's no way they could have found out

09:46.420 --> 09:49.214
unless they put someone in their competitor's office.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.383
I don't know. That sounds kind of extreme.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.885
No, Katrina, it sounds shady, and in my experience,

09:53.885 --> 09:56.054
the other side only does something like that

09:56.054 --> 09:58.098
when they have done something even shadier.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.683
They're hiding something, and you're gonna find it.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.395
No, we're gonna find it. Because there's no way in hell

10:03.395 --> 10:05.730
I'm gonna let Dana Scott get the better of me.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.774
Wait, who? Dana Scott.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.817
I know she used to work here or something.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.738
She didn't just work here. What does that mean?

10:13.738 --> 10:15.782
I'm not sure it's really my place to--

10:15.782 --> 10:19.077
Katrina, do I have to say it again?

10:19.077 --> 10:20.537
You owe me.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.790
She and Harvey were together,

10:23.790 --> 10:26.709
so if she knows things she shouldn't,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.211
he's the first place I'd look.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.340
Hey, Harvey.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.301
Dick over any of your partners lately?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.010
Nice weather we're having.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.012
Did you hear what I said? I ignored it.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.056
I have no idea what you're talking about.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.849
The name Dana Scott ring any bells?

10:41.849 --> 10:44.519
You just helped her make me look like a sleazebag

10:44.519 --> 10:46.605
in front of a judge. Slow your roll, Tiger.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.689
I didn't help her. All I said was:

10:48.689 --> 10:51.234
"You're a badass and sometimes..."

10:51.234 --> 10:53.570
Sometimes what

10:53.570 --> 10:55.155
Because she used that against me.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.949
I did give her that, but I didn't do it to help her.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.577
Well, whether you meant to help her or not, you did.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.955
So how about leveling the field and helping the home team?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.624
No way. I'm not getting involved.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.000
Why not? It'll just make her

11:07.000 --> 11:08.918
want to win all the more.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.671
Oh. So you're that kind of guy.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.131
What kind of guy?

11:13.131 --> 11:15.383
Handsome, powerful men-- goes one of two ways.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.136
You either want a woman who doesn't challenge you at all

11:18.136 --> 11:20.430
or you want one who challenges you all the time.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.182
I'm sorry, I stopped listening after

11:22.182 --> 11:24.017
the handsome and powerful part.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.519
The thing is, Harvey,

11:25.519 --> 11:27.728
with someone who challenges you all the time,

11:27.728 --> 11:30.482
there's always unfinished business.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.233
This is your chance to finish it.

11:32.233 --> 11:35.278
No, Samantha, this is just a chance to rip open an old scar,

11:35.278 --> 11:36.946
and I'm not doing it.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.697
Well, she just ripped me open,

11:38.697 --> 11:41.409
and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to return the favor.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.036
You don't want to help me, don't,

11:43.036 --> 11:46.540
but you sure as hell better stop helping her.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.636
Katrina. Harvey.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.722
What are you doing in here? Just having a coffee.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.308
No, you're here because you know

12:05.308 --> 12:07.561
I'm working with Samantha in her office.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.854
You don't want her to hear what you have to say.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.273
What if I don't

12:12.273 --> 12:14.942
I guess that depends on exactly what it is you want.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.404
I want to know if there's a deal to be had here.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.822
I don't know. Right now, Samantha is so pissed.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.659
Don't think she'd take anything less than an outright win.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.661
Samantha won't stop looking for leverage

12:24.661 --> 12:27.497
until she finds something that gives her the upper hand.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.541
Pretty much, yeah.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.959
Tell me this...

12:31.959 --> 12:34.713
what would a compromise look like?

12:37.798 --> 12:40.134
Louis, what are you doing?

12:40.134 --> 12:42.761
I'm not leaving until you sign this engagement letter.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.599
I told you, I have the matter handled.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.016
By Dick Corman

12:47.016 --> 12:49.352
who couldn't handle his way out of a paper bag.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.812
You let me do this or you tell me what's going on,

12:51.812 --> 12:53.690
but I'm a better lawyer than this guy.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.567
Louis, please. Don't you believe

12:55.567 --> 12:56.943
that I'm great at what I do?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.653
If I thought you didn't think that,

12:58.653 --> 13:00.113
I wouldn't have seen you all these years.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.115
I do believe you're great at what you do,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.743
but you overreact. Particularly when it involves

13:04.743 --> 13:06.035
people you care about.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.121
Damn it, Stan, your career is on the line.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.915
You hire me, you have my word that won't happen.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.918
I am well aware my career is on the line, Louis.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.878
It is all I can think about.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.589
Well, then think about this.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.425
How many times have you told me that I get in my own way?

13:20.425 --> 13:22.176
Well, now you're getting in yours,

13:22.176 --> 13:24.512
because I am the best man for this job

13:24.512 --> 13:26.598
and deep down you know it.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.771
Okay, Louis, you can represent me,

13:32.771 --> 13:34.439
but under one condition.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.483
I just told you I'll keep myself in check.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.944
No, Louis. One other condition.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.032
Thanks, Bill. Who's Bill?

13:45.032 --> 13:47.702
Just one of my many lovers calling to say hi.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.622
Or your doorman calling to say he's got your dry cleaning.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.957
Why can't he be both? Now why don't you tell me

13:52.957 --> 13:54.875
what you're doing in enemy territory.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.711
See, that's the thing, Scottie.

13:56.711 --> 14:00.799
You're an opponent. You're not an enemy.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.551
I don't want to see you get hurt.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.261
What is that? A way out.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.013
We buy your client at a fair price,

14:07.013 --> 14:09.349
they make a fortune, everybody comes out ahead.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.975
I win the championship.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.686
You want me to share the trophy?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.061
You didn't win anything yet,

14:14.061 --> 14:16.690
and she's not letting this go. So what?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.650
You two are on a collision course,

14:18.650 --> 14:21.820
and it isn't gonna be pretty. I didn't pick this fight.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.739
You escalated it by using information you got from me

14:24.739 --> 14:26.449
to go personal against my partner.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.785
I did what I had to do on behalf of my client.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.662
Samantha's gonna do what she has to

14:30.662 --> 14:33.164
and trust me, what she's willing to do

14:33.164 --> 14:36.167
isn't something you want a piece of.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.837
Does she even know about this?

14:38.837 --> 14:42.089
I should have known. Get out of my office, Harvey.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.758
I don't believe this.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.594
You lie to my face about taking a case against me,

14:46.594 --> 14:48.471
and now you're upset that I don't have

14:48.471 --> 14:50.682
Samantha's approval before coming over here?

14:50.682 --> 14:53.059
I said I didn't have a case against you, not her.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.686
Now you do have a case against me

14:54.686 --> 14:57.772
whether you like it or not. I gave you that offer,

14:57.772 --> 15:00.274
which means you have to present it to your client.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.235
You are not one of the attorneys listed.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.903
I do not have to present anything,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.822
if I did, I can tell you what they'd say.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.114
"Go to hell." Scottie--

15:07.114 --> 15:08.825
Thank you for the warning, Harvey,

15:08.825 --> 15:10.702
but I'm doing just fine.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.747
Okay, have it your way, but don't come crying to me

15:13.747 --> 15:15.998
when she figures out how to turn the tables.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.886
Hello?

15:27.886 --> 15:30.179
SCOTTIE : <i>Samantha, it's Dana Scott.</i>

15:30.179 --> 15:32.973
Dana, to what do I owe the pleasure?

15:32.973 --> 15:35.810
Look, we got off on the wrong foot today.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.813
You obviously don't want to be in business with us anymore,

15:38.813 --> 15:40.981
so I came up with a compromise. I'm listening.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.359
<i>You honor your contract</i> <i>for the next 18 months</i>

15:43.359 --> 15:45.862
and reduce your fees every quarter after that,

15:45.862 --> 15:48.406
and we won't enforce our exclusivity clause.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.658
I get it. You get to keep your revenue stream

15:50.658 --> 15:52.285
so your earnings don't take a hit,

15:52.285 --> 15:55.663
and we get to quietly pursue a new partnership.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.291
Plus, you save the backlash from me telling the judge

15:58.291 --> 16:01.168
that you're still working on this, like I know you are.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.171
I gotta say... it's a pretty good move.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.049
And under other circumstances, you'd have yourself a deal.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.510
<i>What other circumstances?</i> One where there wasn't

16:09.510 --> 16:11.178
more going on than meets the eye.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.180
There's nothing else going on here.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.515
Save it. You're coming to me

16:14.515 --> 16:16.517
with a compromise when you have me?

16:16.517 --> 16:18.937
You did something here, and I'm gonna find it.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.855
What makes you think I won't find more?

16:20.855 --> 16:23.566
It took me barely an hour to find what I already did.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.486
I think playing dirty isn't your specialty.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.112
You took a walk on the wild side,

16:28.112 --> 16:30.824
and turns out you fucked with the wrong marine.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.492
Listen to me-- <i>Sorry, Dana.</i>

16:32.492 --> 16:33.827
I'm done listening

16:33.827 --> 16:36.203
because I got to get back to looking.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.207
Gretchen, need something?

16:40.207 --> 16:42.669
The report on that diabetes machine came in.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.504
Why are you bringing me this?

16:44.504 --> 16:47.047
I know you're gonna use it to attack that husband.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.342
If you're here to tell me not to go after him,

16:49.342 --> 16:50.885
I'm already twisted up about it.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.929
As someone whose husband died of diabetes,

16:52.929 --> 16:54.889
I'm telling you do what you have to do.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.390
Your husband died of diabetes?

16:56.390 --> 16:59.018
He did. And that man is grieving.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.729
He's looking for an answer, and I can't blame him,

17:01.729 --> 17:03.564
but without machines like that one,

17:03.564 --> 17:06.734
my Carl wouldn't have lived as long as he did.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.406
Hey, how did you even know about this case?

17:12.406 --> 17:16.661
Well, we never really discussed the client you lost

17:16.661 --> 17:18.412
because of me. We didn't need to.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.998
They never should have asked me to let you go,

17:19.998 --> 17:21.457
and I never would have done it.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.376
All the same, I never thanked you

17:23.376 --> 17:25.336
'cause I didn't know how.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.129
So you were keeping tabs on my cases

17:27.129 --> 17:28.464
waiting for a way to help.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.341
I know it really isn't helping, but--

17:30.341 --> 17:32.635
You just showed me it was okay to do something

17:32.635 --> 17:34.554
I never thought I'd have to do.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.515
If that isn't help, I don't know what is.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.475
Thanks, Alex.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.776
All right, we've been at this for hours.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.277
It's getting us nowhere.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.154
We need to shake down some employees.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.156
That's well and good, but if we don't know

17:54.156 --> 17:56.993
what to ask, we're not going to get answers.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.993
Yes, we will.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.786
They don't know what we don't know.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.454
They don't know what we don't know.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.998
Yeah, that's what I just said.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.042
No, I'm saying according to this report

18:04.042 --> 18:07.045
their accounts are growing by 200 percent a month.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.171
Wait a second, if that's true, why are they

18:09.171 --> 18:11.173
clinging to this deal like a life raft?

18:11.173 --> 18:14.510
Maybe they're not really growing by 200 percent a month.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.598
Look.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.600
February...

18:20.600 --> 18:22.518
5 million new users,

18:22.518 --> 18:25.187
but 60 percent didn't meet the transaction threshold,

18:25.187 --> 18:26.940
parsing a likelihood of the fact--

18:26.940 --> 18:28.524
Katrina, English.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.611
Sixty percent of these card holders

18:31.611 --> 18:35.615
don't even seem to know they have the cards.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.033
Holy shit.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.453
The people are real, but the accounts are fake.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.830
This isn't just shady, this is the type of shit

18:42.830 --> 18:44.665
that lands someone in prison.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.089
Wait till the judge sees this. The judge?

18:51.089 --> 18:53.800
Why don't you just leverage them into letting us out?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.134
I have the upper hand now.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.261
I'm not giving her a chance to get it back.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.180
If she has anything to do with this, it would ruin her.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.766
If she didn't want to be ruined,

19:01.766 --> 19:03.893
she shouldn't have gotten involved in this,

19:03.893 --> 19:07.271
and she damn sure shouldn't have fucked with me.

19:07.271 --> 19:11.109
I want everything you have ready for court in 36 hours.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.786
Scottie, what are you doing here?

19:21.786 --> 19:23.621
I need to know if Samantha Wheeler

19:23.621 --> 19:25.832
is really the attack dog Harvey says she is.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.500
I heard about you tricking Harvey

19:27.500 --> 19:28.876
into giving you information.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.753
I'm not gonna let you do the same to me.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.296
This is not about tricking you.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.256
This is about me staying out of prison.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.967
What?

19:35.967 --> 19:37.885
Please.

19:50.773 --> 19:52.900
My clients have been creating fake accounts.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.444
I found out, and I've been helping them cover it up.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.988
How could you-- I know.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.615
I put a stop to it, but if I can buy them some time,

19:59.615 --> 20:00.992
they can dig themselves out,

20:00.992 --> 20:03.285
and hundreds of good people can keep their jobs.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.205
Scottie, what exactly are you here to ask me?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.540
I want you to convince Harvey

20:07.540 --> 20:09.667
to make Samantha honor that contract.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.960
Are you crazy?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.879
With a company that's committed fraud?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.881
They're making up for the fake accounts,

20:14.881 --> 20:17.091
but they lose their contract, they go under,

20:17.091 --> 20:19.010
and everything comes out.

20:19.010 --> 20:23.014
Okay, let's say that I believe you.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.099
Why are you coming to me and not Harvey?

20:25.099 --> 20:26.517
He came to me with a deal.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.644
I told him to go to hell. Why?

20:28.644 --> 20:30.855
If we take that deal, they open up the books

20:30.855 --> 20:32.356
and everything comes out.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.859
Harvey's gonna find out one way or the other,

20:34.859 --> 20:36.152
and you want me to tell him

20:36.152 --> 20:37.737
instead of telling him yourself.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.530
What the hell is really going on?

20:39.530 --> 20:41.866
Okay, fine, you want the truth?

20:44.535 --> 20:46.996
I'm ashamed of what I did,

20:46.996 --> 20:48.664
and maybe I wouldn't have done it

20:48.664 --> 20:51.625
if it didn't save those jobs, but maybe I would have...

20:51.625 --> 20:53.669
because I signed that company. I put my ass on the line

20:53.669 --> 20:55.713
for them,

20:55.713 --> 20:57.423
and I wasn't going to let them fail.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.134
If that's the case, Harvey would definitely understand.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.802
he's done the same thing himself.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.888
Maybe he would, but I need him to do this,

21:03.888 --> 21:05.598
and let's face it. For a long time,

21:05.598 --> 21:08.517
you've had a lot more sway over him than me.

21:08.517 --> 21:12.271
I convince him to help you.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.149
From now on, you steer clear of our firm.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.692
You mean steer clear of Harvey.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.611
I said what I meant, Scottie.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.571
Yes or no?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.285
Mr. Grant, you have a moment? Actually, no.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.037
I don't care. My name is Louis Litt,

21:28.037 --> 21:30.206
and I'm representing Dr. Stanley Lipschitz.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.332
I thought Dick-- You thought you got lucky

21:32.332 --> 21:33.793
and Dick was handling this.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.419
The big dogs are here.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.755
They better be here with a big, fat settlement.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.633
My client lost his livelihood due to your client's mistake.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.135
Your client lost his livelihood

21:42.135 --> 21:43.844
because he had a manic episode.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.513
I have 50 years of precedent that says you cannot blame

21:46.513 --> 21:48.891
a doctor for reasonably prescribing medication.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.517
Normally, I would walk in and say

21:50.517 --> 21:52.728
I've got you by the balls, squeeze tighter

21:52.728 --> 21:55.231
until you beg for mercy, but I'm not gonna do that.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.774
Oh, no? No. I'm gonna offer you

21:56.774 --> 21:58.818
a reasonable settlement you're gonna take.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.611
There's not one person on the planet

22:00.611 --> 22:03.197
that believes my client was at fault here.

22:03.197 --> 22:05.491
Actually, there is one person.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.368
And he just happens to be the leading expert in the field.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.496
You're gonna take whatever you're offer was

22:10.496 --> 22:13.249
and add two more zeroes, because I got you, asshole,

22:13.249 --> 22:15.584
and that testimony proves it. It proves nothing.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.878
When I get through with your so-called expert,

22:17.878 --> 22:19.964
the jury's gonna see a quack who is willing

22:19.964 --> 22:22.258
to sell his testimony to the highest bidder.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.384
I'll see you in court.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.055
ALEX: Mr. Kendrick,

22:25.678 --> 22:28.055
did your wife

22:28.055 --> 22:29.974
manage her insulin levels all by herself?

22:29.974 --> 22:31.976
No, her doctor set her base levels,

22:31.976 --> 22:33.560
and I monitored her daily needs.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.188
Isn't it true you recently changed

22:35.188 --> 22:37.023
the brand of cartridge you used?

22:35.188 --> 22:37.023
Yes.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.440
We tried the newest one,

22:38.440 --> 22:40.609
that your machine said it would accommodate.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.320
It does, but it also requires

22:42.320 --> 22:45.114
the overnight dosage time to be manually set by the user.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.615
Who did that? I did.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.659
I set the machine for 2 a.m. like always.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.703
Why did the machine not deliver the dosage

22:50.703 --> 22:52.079
until 3 a.m.? I don't know.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.081
Why don't you ask your client? I have.

22:54.081 --> 22:57.001
I've also asked an expert third party to check the machine.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.711
They both said it was working fine,

22:58.711 --> 23:00.587
yet that dose wasn't delivered until 3.

23:00.587 --> 23:01.881
Is there a question? Yes.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.299
Is it possible, Mr. Kendrick,

23:03.299 --> 23:05.009
that you set the machine for 3 a.m.?

23:05.009 --> 23:07.220
No, absolutely not. How can you be sure?

23:07.220 --> 23:08.971
Because I double-checked the time.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.597
I always double-check. It said 2.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.975
When did you double Right before bed.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.935
What time was that? I don't remember--

23:14.935 --> 23:16.312
You don't remember the time,

23:16.312 --> 23:18.147
but you remember checking the machine.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.316
Yes, I do, and it was probably around 10.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.901
So it was late. You were tired.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.195
That doesn't mean

23:24.195 --> 23:25.905
Why not

23:25.905 --> 23:27.865
You're a computer

23:27.865 --> 23:29.616
That's not fair! No, what's not fair

23:29.616 --> 23:31.702
is you blaming my client for your mistake.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.453
There are only two factors here--

23:33.453 --> 23:34.621
that machine and you.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.456
When I present all this plus the fact

23:36.456 --> 23:38.876
there is no instance of our machine ever failing,

23:38.876 --> 23:40.460
if the jury finds in your favor,

23:40.460 --> 23:42.796
the judge will throw it out as a matter of law.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.715
I checked that time. I see it in my mind,

23:44.715 --> 23:47.343
and you are never going to tell me different.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.639
How low can you be to pin this on him?

23:52.639 --> 23:55.101
Don't give me that. My client started this company

23:55.101 --> 23:56.727
because his own family needed it.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.812
The world's a better place because he did.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.773
We gave you an offer. It still stands.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.816
I'd advise your client to take it.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.532
Harvey, we need to talk about Scottie.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.285
No, we don't. Yeah, we do,

24:12.285 --> 24:14.703
because this isn't just the usual case of you two

24:14.703 --> 24:18.040
screwing each other over for fun. She's--

24:14.703 --> 24:18.040
I know.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.293
She's involved in some shady shit.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.878
You know

24:22.878 --> 24:24.171
Doesn't matter how.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.839
What are you gonna do about it?

24:25.839 --> 24:27.591
I'm not gonna do anything about it.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.802
She had every chance to ask for help,

24:29.802 --> 24:32.179
she didn't, and when I came to her with a deal,

24:32.179 --> 24:33.555
she told me to go to hell.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.849
If she took that deal, it would all come out.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.851
Well, it's all gonna come out now anyway.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.020
I don't believe this.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.231
What is wrong with you?

24:42.231 --> 24:43.941
She's only in this mess because

24:43.941 --> 24:45.525
she tried to save people's jobs,

24:45.525 --> 24:47.403
and you might have done the same thing.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.029
Why are you even defending her?

24:49.029 --> 24:50.990
Why shouldn't I? You've always been--

24:50.990 --> 24:52.616
Been what?

24:52.616 --> 24:55.493
Afraid to say it?

24:55.493 --> 24:57.871
Yeah, that's not a surprise.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.416
Well, Harvey, believe it or not,

25:00.416 --> 25:02.335
I care about her.

25:02.335 --> 25:05.129
Every time we've ever needed her she's been there for us.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.880
Not last year with Stanley Gordon.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.090
Maybe not every time,

25:08.090 --> 25:10.050
but when it was you on the line or Mike,

25:10.050 --> 25:11.718
she was there. In case you forgot,

25:11.718 --> 25:13.679
you did the same thing with Teddy Doyle,

25:13.679 --> 25:16.140
and not a week ago you came to me to save your ass

25:16.140 --> 25:17.641
just like she did this morning.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.019
You two are peas in a pod, you always have been.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.855
And for a guy who says loyalty is a two-way street...

25:22.855 --> 25:24.815
you sure as hell aren't acting like it.

25:24.815 --> 25:26.608
Because we aren't two peas in a pod.

25:26.608 --> 25:29.153
She's supposed to be better than me.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.780
Harvey. Donna, she did this.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.407
She didn't even tell me about it.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.201
I'm supposed to make my new partner,

25:35.201 --> 25:36.869
who I unknowingly sold out,

25:36.869 --> 25:41.415
take it easy...on the person I sold her out to.

25:41.415 --> 25:44.542
And I understand all that, but if it were me,

25:44.542 --> 25:46.504
I'd get Samantha to back off anyway.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.594
Gretchen, can I talk to you for a second?

25:54.594 --> 25:55.888
About what?

25:55.888 --> 25:58.015
About how it went with our plaintiff today.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.433
Of course, what happened?

25:59.433 --> 26:00.934
I hammered him again and again.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.895
It didn't matter. He stuck to his story,

26:02.895 --> 26:04.480
said he didn't care what I said

26:04.480 --> 26:06.273
or the machine or that report said.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.150
He checked the time, and it was 2 a.m.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.152
What are you looking for me to tell you?

26:10.152 --> 26:11.445
You made a mistake with me

26:11.445 --> 26:13.072
you never thought you could make.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.740
I guess I'm looking for you to say

26:14.740 --> 26:16.700
the same thing must have happened here.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.411
I can't tell you that. Why not?

26:18.411 --> 26:21.288
Because I never followed up with that messenger.

26:21.288 --> 26:24.208
That was my mistake, never following up.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.377
But he's saying that he did follow up,

26:26.377 --> 26:27.920
and if that's the case,

26:27.920 --> 26:30.297
you painted that man as guilty when he wasn't.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.673
And all that bullshit I said

26:31.673 --> 26:36.303
about it being worth it goes out the window.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.013
All right.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.682
I need some time to think. No.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.143
You need someone to help you sort through this mess

26:43.143 --> 26:45.438
and figure out what's going on here.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.780
Alex, what are you doing?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.782
Couldn't wait till tomorrow to bill me?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.410
I wish that's why I was here, Tony.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.870
But something James said didn't sit right with me,

27:01.870 --> 27:04.039
so...I went back through everything,

27:04.039 --> 27:06.292
and I found this. What is that?

27:06.292 --> 27:09.295
Turns out the software update on those new cartridges,

27:09.295 --> 27:10.879
the ones James used--

27:10.879 --> 27:14.425
Glitched for exactly 12 minutes between 9:43 and 9:55.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.051
The exact window which I suspect

27:16.051 --> 27:18.262
Anne Kendrick's machine reset.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.763
Fuck.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.308
Tony, I've got to ask. Did you know about this?

27:22.308 --> 27:24.268
You know me a long time, Alex.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.811
How can you accuse me of that?

27:25.811 --> 27:27.438
I'm not accusing you of anything,

27:27.438 --> 27:30.190
but I need the truth. The truth is I didn't know about

27:30.190 --> 27:31.525
this until eight second ago.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.486
If you hadn't looked where you shouldn't,

27:33.486 --> 27:35.321
you wouldn't. What does that mean?

27:35.321 --> 27:37.406
I need you to pretend you never saw this.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.532
Tony, a woman is dead.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.409
This isn't gonna bring her back,

27:40.409 --> 27:42.202
and she was the only person harmed.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.037
No. Her husband lost his wife.

27:44.037 --> 27:47.166
I told him he killed her, so you can keep making this machine.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.792
I don't keep making this machine,

27:48.792 --> 27:50.294
how many people are gonna die?

27:50.294 --> 27:51.795
I shouldn't have to remind you

27:51.795 --> 27:53.506
we don't make sunglasses.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.048
It's my duty to hand this over.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.593
Then back up a truck full of documents and bury it,

27:57.593 --> 27:59.761
because your duty doesn't include your guilt

27:59.761 --> 28:01.888
putting my company out of business.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.269
So you're telling me they did not accept our settlement?

28:07.269 --> 28:09.771
Yes, and before you ask, I did not overreact.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.816
They bought themselves a so-called expert that's saying

28:12.816 --> 28:14.109
you should have known better

28:14.109 --> 28:15.819
than to change that prescription.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.279
What? Stan, trust me.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.781
It happens all the time. Now the next step--

28:19.781 --> 28:20.991
Who do they have?

28:20.991 --> 28:22.993
Some joker named Paul Baxter,

28:22.993 --> 28:25.245
I'll admit his credentials look good on paper,

28:25.245 --> 28:26.997
but when I get him on the stand--

28:26.997 --> 28:28.248
Louis, I know this man.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.125
His opinion is not for sale,

28:30.125 --> 28:33.253
and I will not let you ruin his reputation,

28:33.253 --> 28:35.464
because if he's saying I caused this--

28:35.464 --> 28:38.175
He's not saying it. They're pushing him to say it.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.343
And I just told you

28:39.343 --> 28:41.261
they couldn't push him to say anything.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.763
What if I misprescribed, Louis?

28:43.763 --> 28:48.435
What if I am truly responsible for my own patient's breakdown?

28:48.435 --> 28:50.396
And if a jury decides that, so be it.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.565
You're the one who told me a thousand times

28:52.565 --> 28:54.608
it's not an exact science, right?

28:54.608 --> 28:57.653
Craig Boyd is unstable. Could have had a bad day

28:57.653 --> 29:00.531
or a fight with his mother or a thousand other things

29:00.531 --> 29:01.907
that could have caused this,

29:01.907 --> 29:04.410
but we are not going down without a fight.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.581
Okay, Louis.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.832
Do what you must. Put Dr. Baxter on the stand.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.126
Good, and I'm putting Craig Boyd up there too.

29:13.126 --> 29:16.505
What? Louis, you can't do that. He's my patient.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.131
If we don't get you out of this,

29:18.131 --> 29:19.717
no one's gonna be your patient.

29:19.717 --> 29:22.219
Louis, let's say you're correct.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.137
That he broke down for another reason.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.556
What do you think will happen

29:25.556 --> 29:27.224
when you go after him on the stand?

29:27.224 --> 29:28.434
Hopefully, he'll have a breakdown

29:28.434 --> 29:29.893
which will show the first one

29:29.893 --> 29:31.604
had nothing to do with medication.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.397
That is not something I can hope for.

29:33.397 --> 29:37.109
I did what you asked with his lawyer.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.278
I wasn't myself.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.739
But you can't ask me to not do everything I can

29:41.739 --> 29:43.823
to get you out of this. It's him or you.

29:43.823 --> 29:44.991
Then let it be him

29:44.991 --> 29:46.868
because if he were to hurt himself or,

29:46.868 --> 29:49.288
God forbid, worse, I could not live with that.

29:49.288 --> 29:53.375
Stan-- Louis, this is my final word.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.545
So if you insist on going after Craig,

29:56.545 --> 29:58.838
I will find another lawyer.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.889
SAMANTHA: Harvey, whatever it is,

30:05.304 --> 30:07.889
it'll have to wait.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.517
I'm busy preparing. I know what you're preparing.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.395
And I know instead of going to the judge,

30:13.395 --> 30:16.189
you could go to Scottie with this.

30:21.779 --> 30:24.156
She came to you, didn't she?

30:24.156 --> 30:26.032
Because she was in on this thing.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.951
I didn't say that. You didn't have to.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.787
The settlement says it loud and clear.

30:29.787 --> 30:30.912
Look-- No.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.331
I've got proof of fraud.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.040
You're here to get me to let them off the hook.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.251
I'm here to get you to let her off the hook.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.045
Why should I do that

30:39.045 --> 30:40.589
She did it for the right reasons

30:40.589 --> 30:42.299
just like when you buried evidence.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.384
You said you did it for the right reasons,

30:44.384 --> 30:45.927
You told me you'd do it again.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.929
That was to save an innocent woman's life.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.683
This is to save innocent peoples' jobs.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.726
I'm not gonna let you do this to Scottie.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.227
This is my case.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.689
You told me you didn't want anything to do with it.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.940
You want me to sell my client down the river.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.276
I'm not asking you to sell anyone down the river.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.195
I'm asking you to have her back.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.698
This isn't about me having her back.

31:05.698 --> 31:08.283
It's about you having mine.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.369
And you didn't when you told her about me,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.287
you didn't when I came to you for help,

31:12.287 --> 31:14.832
and you don't have it right now.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.919
Maybe I didn't have your back,

31:19.919 --> 31:22.422
but on this one I can't.

31:22.422 --> 31:25.217
Guess I'm saying if you're not willing to have her back,

31:25.217 --> 31:28.220
think of it as having mine.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.687
Donna, can I talk to you a second?

31:36.687 --> 31:38.938
Does this have something to do with Lipschitz?

31:38.938 --> 31:40.858
Yeah.

31:40.858 --> 31:42.526
I have an idea, but it involves

31:42.526 --> 31:44.319
going to his patient behind his back,

31:44.319 --> 31:46.154
threatening to put him on the stand.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.865
Why can't you put him on the stand?

31:47.865 --> 31:49.115
Lipschitz won't let me,

31:49.115 --> 31:51.785
and if he found out I even met with him,

31:51.785 --> 31:54.413
could ruin our relationship.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.331
Then don't do it. But if I don't, Donna,

31:56.331 --> 31:58.250
then he'll probably lose his license.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.168
And as hard as that is to accept,

32:00.168 --> 32:02.421
it's his choice.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.297
So I say if you really care about him,

32:04.297 --> 32:09.928
you need to stop representing him and start being his friend.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.930
I'm not sure if I can do that.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.973
I hope you can.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.269
Louis. Yeah.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.730
As long as we're talking about mixing the personal

32:19.730 --> 32:22.107
with the professional, there's...

32:22.107 --> 32:23.776
something that's been on my mind,

32:23.776 --> 32:26.152
and I haven't told you and it's time that I did.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.738
What is it?

32:27.738 --> 32:30.115
Thomas Kessler and I have been seeing each other,

32:30.115 --> 32:33.034
and I know he's a client-- Say no more, Donna.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.662
Thomas is a good man, and as far as I'm concerned,

32:35.662 --> 32:37.790
if you two are okay with seeing each other

32:37.790 --> 32:39.207
while he's a client, then I'm okay too.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.918
Thanks, Louis. Of course, Donna.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.711
I just have one question.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.713
Have you told Harvey yet?

32:44.713 --> 32:48.133
No, I haven't,

32:48.133 --> 32:50.009
but I will.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.562
I should've known.

33:00.562 --> 33:03.356
You did all this. You went to him, didn't you?

33:03.356 --> 33:07.026
Yes, I did. Goddamn it.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.946
I came to you to help me.

33:08.946 --> 33:11.448
You came to me because I kick ass as an attorney.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.533
In case you didn't notice, you wouldn't be

33:13.533 --> 33:15.994
making a decision if it weren't for me.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.579
In case you didn't notice,

33:17.579 --> 33:19.456
I have already made my decision.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.291
I don't give a shit what Harvey says.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.168
We're in the fourth quarter, up by 10,

33:23.168 --> 33:24.377
I am not taking my foot off the gas.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.963
What the hell is wrong with you?

33:25.963 --> 33:28.423
You have a chance to let someone keep their life

33:28.423 --> 33:29.758
and still get a win.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.927
Is revenge that important? It's not revenge.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.304
It's protection. From what?

33:34.304 --> 33:37.056
She went after me in public.

33:37.056 --> 33:39.058
Tried to expose me as

33:39.058 --> 33:41.311
Exactly who you are? Well, here's a thought.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.313
If you don't want to be exposed at that,

33:43.313 --> 33:45.691
maybe try not being that in the first place.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.067
I can't change who I was. No, but you can start

33:48.067 --> 33:50.069
turning it around right now.

33:50.069 --> 33:52.948
And at the same time, you'll have Harvey owe you

33:52.948 --> 33:54.449
and Scottie owe you.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.827
What good does it do to have those people owe me

33:56.827 --> 33:58.829
if they're just gonna be like you

33:58.829 --> 34:00.956
and not pay up when the time comes?

34:00.956 --> 34:03.208
I am paid up.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.210
You just don't get that because owing you

34:05.210 --> 34:07.337
doesn't mean doing whatever you say.

34:07.337 --> 34:10.048
I am a senior partner, and I have done everything I can

34:10.048 --> 34:11.884
to help you come out a winner in this.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.760
If you can't see that, that's on you.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.680
I'll just say you're welcome and leave it at that.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.064
Gretchen, not now.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.440
Yes, now.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.735
You put in a request for 50,000 documents

34:29.735 --> 34:32.320
to be delivered tonight. I don't wanna talk about it.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.072
Yes, you do or you wouldn't have had

34:34.072 --> 34:36.324
the request specifically take priority over--

34:36.324 --> 34:37.951
I didn't-- Don't bullshit me.

34:37.951 --> 34:40.495
You did that because you don't like what's going on

34:40.495 --> 34:42.455
and you wanted me to talk you out of it.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.165
There is no talking me out of it.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.084
We'll just have to see about that.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.836
It doesn't take a genius to guess

34:47.836 --> 34:49.421
you don't need that many copies

34:49.421 --> 34:51.381
unless you're trying to hide something.

34:51.381 --> 34:53.341
Maybe I wanted you to talk me out of it.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.052
It's too late. They're already gone.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.095
They may be gone, but it's never too late.

34:57.095 --> 35:00.432
Gretchen-- No, imagine it was me.

35:00.432 --> 35:04.394
Imagine you were letting me think I killed my Carl.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.897
Would it still be too late then?

35:12.569 --> 35:15.030
Can I help you? Hi, I'm Louis Litt.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.656
I'm-- I know who are you.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.742
You're the guy representing Dr. Lipschitz,

35:18.742 --> 35:21.286
which means you can't see me without my lawyer here.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.121
Except I'm not here as his attorney.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.664
I'm here as one of his patients.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.083
What? Yeah.

35:26.083 --> 35:29.002
I've been seeing Stan for a very long time,

35:29.002 --> 35:30.670
which is why I know how valuable

35:30.670 --> 35:32.505
having someone like him in the world is

35:32.505 --> 35:34.424
and how much he's probably helped you.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.885
You don't know nothing about me. No, I don't.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.638
But I know about me and the thing about me

35:39.638 --> 35:43.058
is I'd do anything to blame others before I blame myself.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.977
And if you think that's what I'm doing,

35:44.977 --> 35:46.812
then you can go to hell-- What I think

35:46.812 --> 35:49.648
is you're protecting yourself, but what you don't know is

35:49.648 --> 35:51.650
Stanley Lipschitz is protecting you too.

35:51.650 --> 35:52.776
What?

35:52.776 --> 35:54.360
I could put you on the stand now

35:54.360 --> 35:56.195
and I can break you. Look at me.

35:56.195 --> 35:59.658
I can do it in a heartbeat, but he won't let me do that

35:59.658 --> 36:01.326
because of what it would do to you

36:01.326 --> 36:03.829
even if it means losing his ability to help others.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.539
Isn't that proof enough that the world's a better place

36:06.539 --> 36:09.876
with Dr. Stanley Lipschitz doing what he does best?

36:11.711 --> 36:16.257
I lost everything. I have no job.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.426
If I walk away from this, what am I gonna do?

36:18.426 --> 36:21.179
Two things. First, you meet me in my office tomorrow.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.389
I represent the top construction firms

36:23.389 --> 36:27.268
in the country, and we will find you another job.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.896
And then? You call Dr. Lipschitz.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.189
You set up an appointment,

36:31.189 --> 36:34.233
and you start talking this through...

36:34.233 --> 36:37.529
because you need him now more than ever.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.332
Get the hell off my driveway. I get it.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.126
You hate me, but I was doing my job.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.418
It wasn't personal.

36:52.418 --> 36:54.129
You accused me of killing my wife.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.797
Felt pretty goddamn personal to me.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.841
Tell me what the hell you're doing here.

36:57.841 --> 37:00.593
There's a truckload of files on the way to your lawyer.

37:00.593 --> 37:04.389
I was just gonna let them go and...needle in a haystack,

37:04.389 --> 37:05.974
but I couldn't.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.560
So I made a second copy of one file,

37:08.560 --> 37:10.020
and I'm here to give it to you.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.397
Why are you giving it to me and not my lawyer?

37:12.397 --> 37:13.606
This is the one that says

37:13.606 --> 37:15.483
there was a problem with our software.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.651
So you lied to my face.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.236
We didn't lie. We didn't know.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.072
Bullshit. It's not bullshit.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.990
Tony offered that deal when he believed

37:21.990 --> 37:23.950
his company had nothing to do with this.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.451
You're not here to give me this.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.495
You're here to ask me to go easy on him.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.415
No, James. I'm here because in my heart

37:30.415 --> 37:32.625
You had nothing to do with your wife's death,

37:32.625 --> 37:34.419
and I'm sorry I ever said otherwise.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.421
What happened was one in a million thing,

37:36.421 --> 37:38.090
and I also know if this comes out,

37:38.090 --> 37:40.508
more people are going to die, not less.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.427
I know you're a good man.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.888
Please don't put an end to this company.

37:57.859 --> 38:01.362
Scottie, please tell me it all worked out.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.697
It did.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.449
Samantha came to me with a deal,

38:04.449 --> 38:07.452
nothing comes out, we all live to fight another day.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.995
<i>Well, that's great news.</i>

38:08.995 --> 38:11.998
Listen, if I came across as judging you, I--

38:11.998 --> 38:15.127
You didn't. You came through for me, so...

38:15.127 --> 38:17.087
thank you.

38:17.087 --> 38:18.463
But?

38:19.714 --> 38:22.008
Why did you do it?

38:22.008 --> 38:24.469
Why did you help me?

38:24.469 --> 38:26.972
There are a lot of things that we're at odds

38:26.972 --> 38:30.225
with each other about, Scottie, but...

38:30.225 --> 38:32.269
the one thing we've always had in common

38:32.269 --> 38:34.646
is that we both care about him.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.108
And you've always protected him.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.486
That means something.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.990
I called to tell you that

38:44.990 --> 38:47.200
I'm going to live up to my agreement.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.035
From now on, I'll stay away from him.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.787
I told you that's not what I meant.

38:50.787 --> 38:53.790
I know, but I'm going to anyway.

38:53.790 --> 38:59.129
And, Donna...I hope someday he sees what everyone sees.

39:11.099 --> 39:13.268
I'm guessing somebody got a call from Craig.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.936
I did, Louis. Going to him

39:14.936 --> 39:16.896
as a patient instead of as my attorney

39:16.896 --> 39:18.731
was a wonderful idea. I can't thank you enough.

39:20.566 --> 39:23.736
However, there is still one thing we must discuss.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.322
Yeah, if this is about payment,

39:25.322 --> 39:27.699
you can reinstate my weekend texting privileges

39:27.699 --> 39:29.909
and we'll call it even. You know that's not

39:29.909 --> 39:31.077
what I was going to say.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.912
You agreed that once this was over,

39:32.912 --> 39:34.622
I would no longer be your therapist.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.042
<i>I am calling to discuss</i> <i>our transition.</i>

39:37.042 --> 39:39.044
No, I don't accept that.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.586
Louis, you know too much

39:40.586 --> 39:43.006
for me to effectively continue as your therapist.

39:43.006 --> 39:45.842
Well, pardon my French, Stan, but that is bullshit.

39:45.842 --> 39:47.468
Our best breakthroughs were made

39:47.468 --> 39:49.554
by you sharing your personal life with me.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.514
And those were wonderful sessions,

39:51.514 --> 39:54.059
but, Louis, you agreed. <i>No, I don't care.</i>

39:54.059 --> 39:55.935
Louis. Stan,

39:55.935 --> 39:57.187
Even three years ago,

39:57.187 --> 39:59.022
I would have gone behind your back,

39:59.022 --> 40:00.899
threatened to put Craig on the stand,

40:00.899 --> 40:03.860
and God knows what he might have done to himself,

40:03.860 --> 40:07.530
<i>but because of you</i> <i>I went to him with compassion.</i>

40:07.530 --> 40:11.534
If that isn't proof showing me your human side is effective,

40:11.534 --> 40:13.661
Stan, I don't know what is.

40:17.456 --> 40:20.210
Weekend texting will never return,

40:20.210 --> 40:24.422
but I can try to answer your e-mails

40:24.422 --> 40:27.133
in a more timely fashion.

40:27.133 --> 40:31.429
Thank you, Stan. No, Louis, thank you.

40:36.309 --> 40:37.643
Well?

40:37.643 --> 40:39.896
He asked for twice the money so he can set up

40:39.896 --> 40:41.480
a foundation in his wife's name,

40:41.480 --> 40:43.608
but he agreed to keep the settlement sealed.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.860
What about Tony

40:45.860 --> 40:47.820
He did. What'd you tell him?

40:47.820 --> 40:50.156
What I should have told him in the first place.

40:50.156 --> 40:53.285
That what he asked wasn't right by me, James, or anyone else,

40:53.285 --> 40:55.995
and if you ever ask me to do anything like it again,

40:55.995 --> 40:58.706
he can find himself another lawyer.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.666
He's lucky to have you.

41:00.666 --> 41:01.960
And I'm lucky to have you.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.422
Are you hitting on me? No,

41:05.422 --> 41:07.924
but I am inviting you to dinner tomorrow night.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.093
I could invite my father-in-law too.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.428
He's a widower.

41:11.428 --> 41:14.180
Not bad-looking... if you ask him.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.808
And I will tell you what I told Carl.

41:16.808 --> 41:20.519
After he's gone, there won't be any other men.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.147
He didn't believe me either.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.942
See you tomorrow night. Invite Pops.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.194
We'll see what happens.

Hey.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.622
I just wanted you to know--

41:39.622 --> 41:41.791
Scottie called to thank me, Harvey.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.918
That's funny. She just called me.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.171
Well, I guess she's grateful to both of us.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.465
I guess so.

41:48.465 --> 41:51.384
Um...

41:51.384 --> 41:54.637
did she say something to you about...

41:54.637 --> 41:56.431
About what?

41:58.808 --> 42:00.643
Oh, perfect timing. Thomas.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.561
I thought we were meeting downstairs.

42:02.561 --> 42:05.273
I got here a little early. I thought I'd come meet you.

42:05.273 --> 42:07.942
Harvey, this is Thomas-- Kessler, we've met.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.486
Nice to see you again. You too.

42:09.486 --> 42:11.363
Louis always spoke very highly of you.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.198
You too.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.575
Well, shall we? Of course.

42:18.244 --> 42:21.539

42:38.473 --> 42:42.394
I'm sorry I didn't say yes sooner.

42:42.394 --> 42:44.396
She pushed a button.

42:44.396 --> 42:47.732
I let my competitive nature get the better of me.

42:47.732 --> 42:50.651
She does that. She sure does.

42:52.529 --> 42:54.947
Hey, I was gonna go to my office and get a drink,

42:54.947 --> 42:56.741
but now I'm thinking I want to go out.

42:56.741 --> 42:59.827
You care to join me

42:59.827 --> 43:01.162
But you're buying,

43:01.162 --> 43:03.915
'cause after all, I had your back.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.084
I am never gonna hear the end of this, am I?

43:06.084 --> 43:08.336
No, sir, you are not.
