He's not even Ronnie anymore.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.126
Like a vampire.

08:18.320 --> 08:22.723
Is there a reason Stein's brain is in control
of Ronnie's body, not the other way around?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.370
Simple Darwinism, I suspect.

08:24.600 --> 08:28.844

In this case, Ronnie's body, Stein's mind.

08:32.840 --> 08:37.368

and we have hunted meta-humans for less.

of Ronnie's body...

27:35.240 --> 27:38.084
- What are you talking about?
-You and Iris.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.280
Me and Iris? We're not...

27:41.720 --> 27:44.166
Who told you that I was hung up on Iris?

27:46.680 --> 27:49.763
- Hey. Um--
-Hey, what's up?

27:49.960 --> 27:54.170
Why would you tell Linda
that I had feelings for you?

27:54.440 --> 27:57.046
I did not say that. Wait, did I?

27:57.240 --> 28:00.164
Okay, Iris, this isn't funny. I like this girl.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.091
- I know and I am happy for you.
-Really?

28:03.320 --> 28:05.926
Because, I mean, right now,
it sort of feels like...

28:06.120 --> 28:10.125
...you don't want to be with me, and you
don't want anyone else to be with me either.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.170
I've wanted nothing more than
for you to meet someone amazing.

28:13.320 --> 28:17.086
And I did, and you went out of your way
to convince her that I was unavailable.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.966
Look, I'm really sorry.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.009
- Great.
-Do you want me to talk to her?

28:24.200 --> 28:28.091
No, no, no. Absolutely not. Don't talk to her.
I'll figure this out on my own.

28:28.880 --> 28:35.240
I just need you to know that
I don't have those feelings for you anymore.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.170
Yeah, I know.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.009
Okay.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.002
I'll see you later.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.888
Yes, yes, yes.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.726
See, we got two different blood samples.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.002
- One for each speedster.
-That's right.

29:00.160 --> 29:03.084
One is A-positive, and the other one's
AB-negative. Super rare.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.961
I'll run them both through the C.C.P.D.
criminal database, see if I get a match.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.248
Can you run them against a specific person?

29:09.480 --> 29:13.201
Yeah, sure, if we have something
to match it to. Who are we looking at?

29:13.400 --> 29:15.641
Dr. Harrison Wells.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.569
I thought we were trying to solve
Barry's mom's murder.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.290
We are.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.682
And I'm asking you to keep this between us.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.046
You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom?

29:33.360 --> 29:34.771
[SCOFFS]

29:34.920 --> 29:38.925
No way. He didn't even know Barry then.
Why would he kill his mom?

29:39.760 --> 29:41.569
I don't know yet.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.887
But I do know that Wells keeps secrets.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.411
And this may be one of them.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.725
Dr. Wells is a great man.

29:50.920 --> 29:55.403
I was nothing when he gave me a job,
a chance to change my life.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.291
He has helped so many people.
He's not a murderer.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.607
Cisco.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.648
I'm a cop. I'm good at reading people.

30:03.840 --> 30:07.561
So I know I can trust you with my suspicion.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.363
When I go talk to the family and friends
of a murder suspect...

30:11.560 --> 30:14.245
...somebody I know is guilty...

30:14.440 --> 30:16.966
...and I tell them the person they love
is a killer...

30:17.160 --> 30:19.162
...guess what they all say.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.165
"That's not the person I know."

30:25.560 --> 30:28.291
I think I'm done being a cop for today.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.481
Are you comfortable?

30:38.680 --> 30:40.250
A little warm.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.926
Ronnie used to always run warm.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.165
Not that warm.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.204
Can I talk to him?

30:51.680 --> 30:54.843
Sorry, my dear,
I'm not sure it works like that.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.848
I can feel him, though.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.289
I have these memories.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.609
Memories that I know aren't my own.

31:03.760 --> 31:06.331
One is particularly strong.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.251
Piedmont State Park,
it's famous for the Hudson Falls.

31:10.840 --> 31:16.131
I know that I've never been,
but I can remember those waterfalls perfectly.

31:18.520 --> 31:20.682
That's where Ronnie proposed to me.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.721
He loves you very much.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.730
That, I can feel.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.324
<i>WELLS:
Dr. Snow, can we see you for a minute?</i>

31:31.520 --> 31:33.170
Excuse me.

31:37.040 --> 31:40.726
- You okay?
-Yeah, it's just confusing.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.645
What isn't confusing
is what's happening to him now.

31:44.320 --> 31:48.644
Ronnie's body is rejecting Stein's atoms
like a host rejecting a parasite.

31:48.880 --> 31:52.521
The resulting instability
is causing an exothermic reaction.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.889
I worry, if his temperature
continues to rise...

31:56.040 --> 31:57.883
...it'll set off a chain reaction.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.208
And then what happens?

32:02.680 --> 32:04.603
He could go nuclear.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.931
Ronnie.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.171
Not Ronnie.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.204
- Martin Stein.
-Cisco Ramon.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.842
Your colleagues are in the next room,
not so subtly discussing my condition.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.725
That's not freaky at all.

32:29.960 --> 32:34.363
It seems Ronnie's fight with the Flash
has exacerbated the Firestorm matrix.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.204
It's unstable.

32:36.360 --> 32:40.126
It's exponentially increasing the rate
of fission inside his body.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.561
How long does he have?

32:42.760 --> 32:45.969
If his temperature keeps rising
at the current pace...

32:46.720 --> 32:48.290
...no more than a couple of hours.

32:48.520 --> 32:52.161
But you can fix it, right? I mean,
you can separate them before it's too late?

32:52.360 --> 32:56.410
Any attempt we make to separate
the two of them could be catastrophic.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.648
A nuclear explosion.

32:59.400 --> 33:03.325
And a nuclear explosion of this magnitude
would level this entire city.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.289
Unless...

33:06.000 --> 33:07.331
Unless what?

33:07.920 --> 33:10.526
Unless the host body
were no longer functional.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.730
You wanna kill Ronnie?

33:13.880 --> 33:16.201
No, I don't wanna kill Ronnie.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.290
But in this scenario,
Ronnie is the host body.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.603
If you kill Ronnie, you kill Stein.
That's two people.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.206
I don't know how else to stop it.

33:25.440 --> 33:28.808
And my guess is
that if Ronnie and Professor Stein...

33:29.000 --> 33:31.367
...knew the consequences that
we were all facing...

33:31.560 --> 33:33.289
...they would make the same decision.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.728
It's two lives for millions.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.610
Can you give us a minute?

33:48.880 --> 33:51.326
- Caitlin--
CAITLIN: I've already lost Ronnie once.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.251
I'm not gonna do it again.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.726
You said we have a couple of hours.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.843
Use them.

34:06.360 --> 34:09.762
Dr. Wells, you don't really
think we should kill Ronnie, do you?

34:09.920 --> 34:11.922
Stay here, Cisco.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.405
BARRY:
Hey.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.764
Sorry.

34:26.239 --> 34:27.650
Can I get you anything, or...?

34:27.840 --> 34:32.846
A glass of Chateau Haut-Brion
Pessac-Leognan 1982 might be nice.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.524
Or maybe it wouldn't.

34:35.760 --> 34:39.924
This body's taste buds
would obviously be different from my own.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.440
Perhaps I'm now a light beer man.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.043
There are worse things to be.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.646
You mean like a living nuclear bomb?

34:49.480 --> 34:50.561
You know.

34:50.760 --> 34:55.641
Unstable nuclear fission was always a danger
in the transmutation process.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.326
Plus, you all argue very loudly.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.165
I'm sorry.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.648
But my friends are gonna figure out
how to fix this, I promise.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.770
I remember meeting you, Mr. Allen,
on the train.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.450
You were headed to S.T.A.R. Labs
with a girl, but not your girlfriend.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.844
Yeah.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.447
I'm not sure that I have any girlfriend.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.328
You know, Einstein was not only brilliant...

35:25.480 --> 35:28.006
...he had a great sense of humor.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.004
How did it go?

35:30.520 --> 35:33.524
"Any man who drives safely
while kissing a pretty girl...

35:33.680 --> 35:38.607
...is not giving the pretty girl
the attention she deserves."

35:40.160 --> 35:42.811
If I learned anything this past year...

35:42.960 --> 35:45.122
...life's too short not to live.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.603
- Hey.
-What are you doing here?

35:55.840 --> 35:57.922
- I gave you an out.
-I don't want an out.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.168
I won't date someone who's
into someone else.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.527
I'm not into anyone else.
I'll prove it to you.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.644
This is a naga jolokia,
or the ghost pepper.

36:05.840 --> 36:10.880
It is the world's hottest pepper, measuring
401.5 times hotter than Tabasco sauce.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.486
If you do not agree
to go on another date with me...

36:13.680 --> 36:17.002
...I will eat it, right here, right now.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.407
You're bluffing.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.884
I never bluff.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.160
- Are you okay?
-I'm fine, yeah.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.930
- Are you sure?
-Mm-hm.

36:32.800 --> 36:35.087
Yes, yes, I'll go out with you.

36:35.240 --> 36:38.926
- That pepper could've killed you, nerd.
-Thanks. Mm.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.048
Ugh. Thank you.

36:43.080 --> 36:46.209
Okay, I won't let my job...

36:47.000 --> 36:51.767
...or how bad my mouth is burning right now
come between us.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.960
My Spice Champion of Central City. Ha, ha.

37:10.600 --> 37:14.127
<i>GIDEON:
A crude weapon, if I may say so, Dr. Wells.</i>

37:14.280 --> 37:16.601
I couldn't agree more, Gideon.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.966
But it Will do the job.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.810
Gideon...

37:29.360 --> 37:34.287
...can the tachyon prototype be converted
into a quantum splicer?

37:34.560 --> 37:37.643
<i>Theoretically,
but I must warn you, Dr. Wells...</i>

37:37.880 --> 37:40.929
<i>...converting the tachyon prototype
will delay your timetable.</i>

37:41.120 --> 37:45.569
There's not gonna be a timetable if Central
City goes up in a mushroom cloud.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.326
Hey, anything?

37:48.560 --> 37:53.441
I have an idea. It's a bit of a Hail Mary,
but Cisco and I are gonna give it a try.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.561
- Thank you.
<i>- I'll</i> get Professor Stein.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.250
Looking for the professor?

37:58.440 --> 38:00.920
Yeah, he's gone.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.563
- You guys almost done?
-Hang on, hang on.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.564
CAITLIN:
I found Stein. He's in the Badlands.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.644
The middle of nowhere,
3O miles outside of Central City.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.604
Minimum safe distance.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.404
He's sacrificing himself.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.802
How much time does he have left?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.684
Twelve minutes.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.969
And we're done.

38:25.120 --> 38:29.887
- What is it?
-This is a quantum splicer.

38:30.080 --> 38:33.163
- Will it work to separate them?
-We'll know in 12 minutes.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.727
Now, Barry, even you
can't outrun a nuclear blast...

38:35.920 --> 38:40.608
...so you get this device to Professor Stein
and you get out of there as fast as you can.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.529
- What are you doing?
-Going with you.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.409
- No, you're not.
-it's too dangerous.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.762
Barry doesn't know how
to operate the splicer.

38:46.920 --> 38:50.970
- Cisco's gonna talk me through it.
-There's not enough time. Let's go.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.770
Go.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.730
What was that?

39:03.480 --> 39:07.371
Uh, comm system's on the fritz.
I'll be right back.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.165
- Cisco.
-I'm not proud of it but I ran the samples.

39:13.360 --> 39:16.807
- One wasn't identified. The other had a match.
-Cisco, you're hesitating.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.803
- Was it Wells?
-No, it's not Dr. Wells.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.247
I told you, he has nothing to do with this.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.363
But I know whose blood it is.

39:23.560 --> 39:24.607
It's Barry's.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.888
We already know
Barry was there that night.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.128
No, no, no, you don't understand.

39:29.320 --> 39:33.848
The sample had high levels of P-16, a protein
that builds up in the blood as we get older.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.606
<i>And these levels were way too high
for an 11-year-old.</i>

39:37.960 --> 39:41.885
This sample was from Barry as an adult.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.566
Professor Stein!

39:59.920 --> 40:01.968
What are you doing here? You can't be here!

40:02.160 --> 40:03.764
Get her out of here now!

40:04.000 --> 40:07.004
Please, look,
Ronnie's still in there somewhere.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.647
All those people.
Clarissa, I won't let them die.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.569
It's better I end this now.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.370
We can separate you!

40:14.920 --> 40:16.649
We can stop the explosion.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.122
- How?
-A quantum splicer.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.244
It's a fission device
designed to bombard your atoms...

40:23.480 --> 40:27.201
...with as much energy as they experienced
in the particle accelerator explosion.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.204
It should be enough to separate you.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.566
Please, professor,
you have nothing left to lose.

40:38.320 --> 40:41.881
Ronnie, if you're in there...

40:42.440 --> 40:43.851
...I love you.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.928
That was from him.

40:56.880 --> 41:00.646
I look forward to meeting you
in person, professor.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.251
It's not working.

41:13.440 --> 41:17.764
- He's not gonna make it. He's gonna blow.
-Get out of there. Barry, get out of there now.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.442
- Oh, no. No, no!
-Caitlin, we have to go.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.647
Run!

41:26.200 --> 41:27.326
No!

41:44.800 --> 41:46.768
Sir, we have a thermonuclear detonation...

41:46.960 --> 41:49.406
...approximately 30 miles northeast
of Central City.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.410
Deploy the Rapid Response Team, sergeant.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.762
Bring me Firestorm.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.202
[English - US - SDH]
