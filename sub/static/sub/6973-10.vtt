00:02.001 --> 00:05.267
Now I lay me down to sleep,

00:05.338 --> 00:08.637
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

00:08.708 --> 00:12.007
If I die before I wake,

00:12.078 --> 00:15.377
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

Okay, okay, Amber Lynn.
Bedtime. Come on.

00:28.962 --> 00:32.557
You grab Mike, okay?
Hop in.

00:32.631 --> 00:35.533
Let's get you cozy, cozy,
toasty, toasty.

00:35.602 --> 00:38.332
Inside. Snug as a bug.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.498
- Night-night, Lynnie.
- Night-night, Daddy.

00:41.674 --> 00:45.166
- Night, Mommy.
- Night, love.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.973

01:24.084 --> 01:27.815
- Weapon on the floor.
- This is great.

02:18.771 --> 02:22.434
[Man On TV] Where's this trial
I'm being put through?

02:22.509 --> 02:24.909
Is this a test
of my love for you?

02:27.313 --> 02:29.338
Billie?

02:29.415 --> 02:32.851
- They are the ones that want me
to kill myself.

Amber Lynn LaPierre, that's right.

05:30.762 --> 05:32.855
A federal investigation is underway.

05:34.666 --> 05:36.861
The kidnapping in Sacramento,
California.

05:56.321 --> 05:58.812
- Why are you here, Agent Mulder?
- I want this case.

05:58.890 --> 06:02.018
I'm fairly certain I've got more
than enough competent agents in here.

06:02.094 --> 06:05.689
- Ooh, I can see that.
- This is a kidnapping, Agent Mulder.

06:05.764 --> 06:09.564
A little girl snatched from her bedroom.
Basic, missionary-style F.B.I. Work.

06:09.634 --> 06:11.932
- It's not an X-File.
- I'm aware of the facts.

06:13.772 --> 06:16.832
We're trying to rule out all
possibilities before we start
making any statements.

06:16.908 --> 06:19.206
That's what I'm talking about,
ruling out other possibilities.

06:19.277 --> 06:21.370
I can't just give you the case.

06:21.446 --> 06:24.040
I have to follow protocol.

06:24.116 --> 06:27.677
Behavioral gets first crack,
then the people down at N.C.N.E.C.

06:27.753 --> 06:29.880

06:29.955 --> 06:33.220

Every starstruck attorney in America...

06:33.291 --> 06:35.725
is gonna want to represent
these people for free.

06:35.794 --> 06:39.059

the right questions right now,
they may never get asked.

You've got till noon. Mulder...

06:54.146 --> 06:58.742
the agents in my office...
they have a pool going.

06:59.918 --> 07:02.580
They think she's dead.

07:04.089 --> 07:06.216

07:26.545 --> 07:28.740
Excuse me.
Have they found the girl?

07:28.814 --> 07:31.146
Are there any new developments
in the case? Is she dead?

07:31.216 --> 07:34.242
Are the parents suspects in
the disappearance of their daughter?

07:35.821 --> 07:38.085
Sorry, no press
allowed inside.

07:38.156 --> 07:40.954
Special Agent Fox Mulder,
F.B.I.

07:41.026 --> 07:44.462
- I'd like to speak to
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre if I may.
- My clients have nothing to say.

07:45.797 --> 07:48.960
Uh, Harry Bring.
How can I help you?

07:50.669 --> 07:54.196
Mr. Bring, your card says
"real estate law and conveyances."

07:54.272 --> 07:56.365
Have you ever handled
a murder case?

07:56.441 --> 07:59.808
- This isn't a murder case.
- Well, it might as well be...

07:59.878 --> 08:02.574
once the facts about Amber Lynn's
disappearance get out.

08:02.647 --> 08:08.244
My clients are not murderers,
and-and I resent any such accusation.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.812
You know, if you really want to help
your clients, get them a real lawyer.

08:11.890 --> 08:14.154
It's okay, Harry.

08:19.865 --> 08:23.801
- [Sobs]
- Billie and I got nothin' to hide.

08:25.904 --> 08:28.338
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre,
my name is Fox Mulder.

08:28.406 --> 08:31.569
I'm a special agent
with the F.B.I.

08:31.643 --> 08:35.238
I have a lot of experience with crimes
like the one that took place here.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.746
I know you've made
a statement to the police,

08:37.816 --> 08:40.250
but I'd like to ask you
some questions about that.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.775
I'd like you to answer in as
much detail as both you and your
lawyer are comfortable with.

08:43.855 --> 08:46.824
I want to ask you
about the note you found.

08:46.892 --> 08:50.328
Where did you fnd it?

08:50.395 --> 08:52.920
- In my daughter's bedroom.
- When?

08:52.998 --> 08:55.364
When I went
to check on her.

08:55.433 --> 08:59.597
- Do you know what time that was?
- 9;30, I think.

08:59.671 --> 09:01.764
It was right about then.

09:03.775 --> 09:07.108
- I was watching TV in here.
- What were you watching?

09:07.178 --> 09:11.171
I never heard of it before.
It was good.

09:11.249 --> 09:13.877
What about you,
Mrs. LaPierre?

09:19.658 --> 09:22.855
- I was in bed already.
- Were you asleep?

09:22.928 --> 09:25.396
Half.

09:25.463 --> 09:29.058
Is that Amber Lynn's bedroom
that I saw down the hallway there?

09:30.769 --> 09:32.703
Yes.

09:32.771 --> 09:35.899
Do you always lock your doors at night,
even if you're home?

09:37.142 --> 09:39.076
Yes.

09:42.314 --> 09:45.010
You know most of your neighbors,
I bet, up and down the street.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.745
- You're on good terms with them?
- Most of them, yes.

09:49.387 --> 09:51.651
Can you think of anyone who
might've wanted to hurt Amber Lynn?

09:51.723 --> 09:54.021
[Sobbing]

09:55.327 --> 09:57.659
That's enough questions.
They've been very helpful,

09:57.729 --> 10:00.664
but I think you can see that these folks
have nothing whatsoever to hide.

10:03.902 --> 10:06.336
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre,
I want you to understand something,

10:06.404 --> 10:10.272
because it's gonna get
very confusing from here on in.

10:10.342 --> 10:13.743
But whatever else
the F.B.I. Says or does,

10:13.812 --> 10:16.713
they're gonna try their damnedest
to find your little girl.

10:16.781 --> 10:20.114
- Okay.
- Thank you.

10:24.189 --> 10:26.054
Agent Mulder?

10:26.124 --> 10:30.424
Do you think they will...
find her?

10:33.932 --> 10:35.866
Oh, I hope so.

10:36.968 --> 10:40.631
Yeah. I really do.

11:11.236 --> 11:13.170
[Knocking]

11:13.238 --> 11:15.900
It's open.

11:15.974 --> 11:18.772
Mulder?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.711
Come on in.

11:21.780 --> 11:25.011
- What are you doing?
- Thinkin'.

11:25.083 --> 11:28.985
- About?
- Amber Lynn LaPierre.

11:32.524 --> 11:36.824
- Mind if I turn on a light?
- Yeah. I do.

11:40.832 --> 11:43.198
Skinner is royally pissed.

11:48.907 --> 11:52.434
- At you.
- I'm sure he is.

11:52.511 --> 11:55.036
He expected
a report at noon.

11:55.113 --> 11:58.549
He waited. And now he sent me
to find you to get it.

11:58.617 --> 12:03.350
- I don't have a report.
- They had to move on the case.

12:03.421 --> 12:07.152
The media got wind of the police
findings. They're gonna broadcast them.

12:07.225 --> 12:10.058
The parents are being held
for further questioning.

12:10.128 --> 12:13.495
- They're not guilty, Scully.
- The facts would say otherwise.

12:13.565 --> 12:15.533
There's no sign
of a break-in.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.534
Both of the parents were at home
at the time the girl disappeared.

12:17.602 --> 12:21.299
They lied about where
they found the note.

12:21.373 --> 12:24.137
- Why?
- That's what I've been thinkin' about.

12:30.615 --> 12:34.642
Is it the media,
orjust our own morbid fascination
with the killing of an innocent?

12:37.622 --> 12:40.182
She's not dead, Scully.

12:42.093 --> 12:44.527
[Phone Rings]

12:48.533 --> 12:51.730
- Mulder.
- [Woman] Fox, it's me.

12:51.803 --> 12:55.170
- Mom? Hi.
- I'm watching the news.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.004
That little girl in California.
You're out there, aren't you?

13:00.245 --> 13:02.110
Yes.

13:02.180 --> 13:06.879
- I am. Are you okay, Mom?
- When are you coming back here?

13:06.952 --> 13:10.183
Well, I'm not sure.
You know, I don't know.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.855
- Call when you get back, Fox.
- Okay, I will.

13:14.926 --> 13:16.860
Um...

13:16.928 --> 13:19.089
You take care,
Mom, okay?

13:19.164 --> 13:22.031
- [Dial Tone]
- [Receiver Clicks]

13:30.308 --> 13:33.038
[Skinner] From the note, we can
and have determined several facts.

13:33.111 --> 13:36.547
There is a threat of physical violence,
but no demand for money or ransom.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.913
The note is short and written
on a torn piece of paper,

13:38.984 --> 13:42.147
suggesting haste
and little or no planning.

13:44.856 --> 13:49.020
The paper's the type used by dry
cleaners to protect laundered garments.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.927
The torn piece that
the note was found on...

13:51.997 --> 13:56.195
matches exactly a piece that was found
in the garbage at the LaPierre home.

13:56.267 --> 13:59.828
The ink matches a felt-tip pen
that was also found in the garbage.

13:59.904 --> 14:02.930
One set of prints were found on it...
Billie LaPierre's prints.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.977
- Is it her handwriting?
- [Man]
That's gonna be diffcult to prove,

14:06.044 --> 14:08.979
due to the felt-tip pen
and the quality of the paper,

14:09.047 --> 14:12.107
which tends to cause bleeding,
makes the handwriting indistinct.

14:12.183 --> 14:15.619
It also looks like there's been
an attempt to disguise the writing.

14:16.888 --> 14:18.947
By using samples of
Mrs. LaPierre's handwriting,

14:19.024 --> 14:21.925
we see dominant letter forms...
the "S" in "strangle,"

14:21.993 --> 14:24.086
"stray dog,"
here in "Santa Claus."

14:24.162 --> 14:28.030
Matches up with
the "S"'s in "dollars"...

14:29.067 --> 14:31.797
"seven"and "cents."

14:31.870 --> 14:34.805
- Enough to make a connection.
- But not an indictment.

14:37.208 --> 14:40.200
Do you have information you'd like
to share with us, Agent Mulder?

14:40.278 --> 14:42.371
Bud LaPierre says he'd
been watching television...

14:42.447 --> 14:44.779
and had gotten up to go to bed
when he found Amber Lynn missing.

14:44.849 --> 14:46.942
But according to
the police report,

14:47.018 --> 14:50.215
the TVset was still on when
the frst offcers arrived on the scene.

14:50.288 --> 14:53.416
By his own account, both mother
and father put Amber Lynn to bed...

14:53.491 --> 14:56.892
and were never more than 20 feet
from her room during the period
in which she was abducted.

14:56.961 --> 15:01.523
The LaPierres know all their
neighbors up and down the street,
are on good terms with them.

15:01.599 --> 15:05.160
But no one saw a stranger
on a Friday...

15:05.236 --> 15:09.502
at a fairly early hour
enter into a locked and lighted home...

15:09.574 --> 15:11.701
and remove this
little girl undetected.

15:11.776 --> 15:14.472
- Husband's lying for his wife.
- I don't think so.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.071
Why?

15:19.117 --> 15:23.315
Because that doesn't explain
what happened to this little girl.

15:51.816 --> 15:53.909
What are you doing, Mulder?

15:53.985 --> 15:56.215
There's something in that abduction note
that I've seen before.

15:56.287 --> 15:58.221
That's not what I mean.

15:58.289 --> 16:02.453
You're personalizing this case.
You're identifying with your sister.

16:02.527 --> 16:07.362
My sister was taken by aliens.
Did I say anything about aliens?

16:07.432 --> 16:11.027
There are a lot of good agents
up in Skinner's office who do
not have the patience for this.

16:11.102 --> 16:13.570
What did I do?
I provided a logical counterpoint.

16:13.638 --> 16:17.699
- You told them that
they were wrong, Mulder.
- And they are.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.141
Pocatello, Idaho, 1987.

16:22.313 --> 16:25.248
Look familiar?

16:28.953 --> 16:30.887
[Children Chattering, Squealing]

16:50.808 --> 16:52.867
Kathy Lee,
visitors are here.

16:52.943 --> 16:55.810
- Can you let them in, please?
- [Buzzing]

17:01.752 --> 17:04.743
Hi, Ms. Tencate. My name is
Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.481
Can we have a seat?

17:10.127 --> 17:12.560
It's not the Ritz.

17:13.664 --> 17:17.498
Um... we just have
a few questions.

17:17.568 --> 17:21.503
We've reviewed the facts of your case.
The facts seem to speak for themselves.

17:21.571 --> 17:26.134
Your six-year-old son Dean
was taken from his bed while he slept.

17:26.210 --> 17:29.941
A note was found threatening his life,
later determined to be written by you.

17:30.014 --> 17:33.711
You plead innocent at trial,
but you were convicted...

17:33.784 --> 17:36.810
and sentenced to 12 years, even though
your son's body was never found.

17:36.887 --> 17:41.221
- Yes, that's right.
- Your story is that, uh,

17:41.292 --> 17:46.787
on the night your son disappeared,
you had a vision of him dead.

17:46.864 --> 17:49.526
You thought it was your mind
playing tricks on you,

17:49.600 --> 17:53.001
but when you got up to check on him,
he was missing from his bed.

17:53.070 --> 17:55.595
- Is that accurate?
- Yes.

17:55.673 --> 17:58.073
Now, three years ago,
after seven years of incarceration,

17:58.142 --> 18:00.702
you changed your story and confessed
to the murder of your son...

18:00.778 --> 18:05.340
in a fit of insanity,
a psychotic break.

18:05.416 --> 18:08.943
- Yes, that's right.
- Why did you do it?

18:11.756 --> 18:15.192
I don't know.
I was full of rage.

18:18.629 --> 18:21.996
I have a... copy of the note
that you wrote.

18:24.769 --> 18:27.670
Do you mind
if I show it to you?

18:27.738 --> 18:31.834
Now, there's a phrase
down here at the bottom.

18:31.909 --> 18:34.844
"No one shoots
at Santa Claus."

18:34.912 --> 18:37.403
Can you explain
what that means to me?

18:37.481 --> 18:40.075
[Kathy Lee]
Uh... It means that, uh,

18:40.151 --> 18:45.680
when someone promises you something,
a gift, like Santa Claus,

18:45.756 --> 18:49.214
that no one would do anything
for fear of not getting the gift.

18:52.730 --> 18:56.564
A little girl disappeared
from her bed three days ago.

18:56.634 --> 18:58.898
This is the note that was
left at that scene.

19:01.272 --> 19:04.673
Can you take a look at that
and tell me what it says at the bottom?

19:08.312 --> 19:11.247
Same thing.

19:11.315 --> 19:13.783
Neither note makes
a specific demand.

19:13.851 --> 19:17.514
In both cases, there is no evidence
of foul play or break-in.

You're not guilty of anything other
than a lie, just like these people.

The only reason you changed your story
was to get outta here.

might buy the story...

19:53.123 --> 19:55.557

and of your terrible remorse.

out ofjail who claimed her son
just disappeared out of thin air

their story.

could've killed her son?
- She was convicted in a court of law.

36:51.005 --> 36:53.599
- He's here.
- Hm?

36:53.675 --> 36:56.041
Come in, Agent Mulder.

37:03.318 --> 37:05.786
It's okay.
She's here to help.

37:08.189 --> 37:10.350
What happened here, Billie?

37:12.594 --> 37:16.360
I saw my daughter
right in this room...

37:18.533 --> 37:21.696
standing right there.

37:21.770 --> 37:25.103
I swear to God,
she was right over there...

37:25.173 --> 37:29.109
in the pajamas
her grandma gave her...

37:29.177 --> 37:31.111
saying something to me.

37:31.179 --> 37:36.276
- What was she saying?
- I don't know.

37:36.351 --> 37:40.185
Her lips were moving,
but I couldn't hear.

37:43.024 --> 37:44.958
I thought...

37:46.795 --> 37:49.730
I thought she
was saying "74."

37:49.798 --> 37:54.963
74? The number 74?
Does that mean anything to you?

37:59.741 --> 38:03.336
74 mean anything to you,
Mr. LaPierre?

38:14.489 --> 38:16.423
Let's go home.

38:16.491 --> 38:18.686
Mulder, we just got here.

38:18.760 --> 38:22.491
We're not gonna...
find these people's daughter alive.

38:22.564 --> 38:25.032
- How do you know that?
- What we're hearing, it's...

38:25.099 --> 38:28.591
the delusional talk of people
that don't want to accept the truth.

38:28.670 --> 38:31.230
- You think they know what
happened to their child?
- Maybe, maybe not.

38:31.306 --> 38:34.833
But you can't see a ghost
and still hope to find her alive.

38:34.909 --> 38:37.139
Both things
can't be true.

38:37.212 --> 38:40.670
If this little girl's spirit
really did appear to her mother,

38:40.748 --> 38:43.012
then there's probably
only one explanation.

38:43.084 --> 38:47.020
You think their
daughter's dead.

38:47.088 --> 38:50.615
- Well, what about the handwritten note?
- I don't know what that means.

38:50.692 --> 38:53.684
I don't know what is the truth
and what isn't anymore.

38:53.761 --> 38:57.595
I'm way too close to this case
to make any kind of sound judgment.

38:57.665 --> 39:01.692
In fact, I would like to ask for you
to let me off this case, please,

39:01.769 --> 39:04.567
and I'd like to take
some time off.

39:41.709 --> 39:43.836
What is it?

39:47.515 --> 39:50.075
- Santa Claus.
- What?

39:50.151 --> 39:52.517
Stop. Turn around.

41:14.302 --> 41:16.770
Some of these tapes
go back to the '60s.

41:31.986 --> 41:34.216
I think I know what
we're gonna find here.

41:34.288 --> 41:36.916
It's what my mother was
afraid of... my sister.

41:40.094 --> 41:44.121
[Children Chattering, Squealing]

41:44.198 --> 41:47.190
It's Amber Lynn LaPierre.

41:50.505 --> 41:54.908
This tape is dated two days
before her disappearance.

42:10.058 --> 42:11.491
Hey!

42:39.821 --> 42:42.119
- Stop!
- [Gun Fires]

42:45.359 --> 42:47.793
Keep your hands up!

42:51.265 --> 42:54.894
- What's your name?
- Ed Truelove.

42:54.969 --> 42:57.870
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

42:57.939 --> 43:00.271
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say...

43:00.341 --> 43:02.605
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

43:02.677 --> 43:04.770
You have the right
to speak with an attorney...

43:04.846 --> 43:07.280
and to have your attorney
present during questioning.

43:07.348 --> 43:10.283
If you so desire and cannot afford one...
[Continues, Indistinct]

43:17.024 --> 43:19.686
Scully.

44:26.059 --> 44:28.755
[Child]
I made this!
