18:55.676 --> 18:59.846
I have to confess, I'm not
quite in the mood anyway.

18:59.846 --> 19:01.307
Really?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.600
I just took on
this new client,

19:03.600 --> 19:07.479
and I don't think
I can help him.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.605
You can't?

19:08.605 --> 19:10.941
No,
he's one of those people

19:10.941 --> 19:14.611
there's just no hope for.

19:14.611 --> 19:17.030
Not even a little bit?

19:17.030 --> 19:18.532
No.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.910
It's very upsetting.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.496
Yes, it is.

19:47.394 --> 19:50.021
Oh, you got rid
of the soul patch.

19:50.021 --> 19:52.649
Yeah, I shaved it off
a week ago.

19:52.649 --> 19:56.237
Still, remember when
he had it?

19:56.237 --> 19:58.614
Really, we're gonna
do this again?

19:58.614 --> 20:01.074
You know, the ninth
fairway e-mailed me,

20:01.074 --> 20:03.452
and it wants its divot back.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.579
This doesn't
make sense anymore.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.789
The world's tiniest
plane called, yeah,

20:07.789 --> 20:11.585
they wanna know if the runway
is clear for landing.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.669
Can we just move on?

20:12.669 --> 20:15.464
A Brazilian porn star
left a message, she--

20:15.464 --> 20:17.216
I know what she
wants back, okay?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.343
I don't have it anymore!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.512
Hey.
Hey, guys.

20:21.512 --> 20:25.724
Oh, guys, guys,
look what she's wearing.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.058
Oh, crap.

20:27.058 --> 20:28.519
Where you going?

20:28.519 --> 20:31.438
Did you double-park
your gondola?
