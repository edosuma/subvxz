ANYWHERE.

IT'S NICE
TO GO OUT WITH SOMEBODY

SOMEBODY WHO IS FAMILY!

14:58.631 --> 15:00.433
THERE WAS $2,000
IN IT FOR ME, OKAY?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.269
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
A REAL DATE.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.737

THEY WERE GONNA END UP KISSING!

I WALKED IN ON THEM, GEORGE.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

15:22.122 --> 15:26.093
IT WAS LIKE A GIANT FISH
