[Tony] Cisco, get us out of here.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.819
[Echo] Am I the only one who misses

00:27.902 --> 00:30.947
mind-controlled people attacking
the hauler instead of zombie cars?

00:31.030 --> 00:32.115
[all exclaim]

00:32.198 --> 00:34.200
Those were simpler times.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.827
We'll be moving in just a second,

00:35.910 --> 00:38.371
as soon as Frostee
gets this airlock door open.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.914
Uh-oh. Hold on.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.083
We're already getting attacked
by angry cars

00:42.167 --> 00:43.752
and trapped in an underwater base.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.713
-Now why are you saying "uh-oh"?
-[Frostee] The AI is mutating.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.840
It's trying to jump back into the hauler!

00:48.923 --> 00:50.967
Ah, you got to stop it, Frostee!

00:51.050 --> 00:55.263
I can't handle another fro-yo attack, and
I'm the most lactose tolerant guy around.

-[sighs]

00:58.475 --> 00:59.517
Good! Let's move.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.062
But this virus
is getting smarter and evolving.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.147
It's harder to stop every time.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.649
That's why we need to
destroy this entire base

01:06.733 --> 01:09.069
before the Toretto Virus hits land.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.905
Otherwise we're looking at
a technological apocalypse

01:11.988 --> 01:13.990
like nothing the world has ever seen.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.785

every smartphone,

01:18.453 --> 01:21.081
every beloved electric blanket

01:21.164 --> 01:25.293
will turn against its owner,
broken free from its human overlords!

01:26.086 --> 01:28.588
Uh, this is usually my thing,
the overdramatic build up.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.924
Can we stop calling it
the Toretto Virus, okay?

01:31.007 --> 01:33.218
That's not really how I see myself,
as a virus.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.637
Also, who uses an electric blanket?

01:36.221 --> 01:38.389
She has poor circulation in her feet.

Probably all those pork pies.

after we find a way out of here?

01:49.526 --> 01:52.362
The AI has the door shut down.
I can't hack it!

01:52.445 --> 01:54.072
Then let's blast our way out.

02:23.059 --> 02:26.062
So we're just gonna be trapped in here
all the way to Bangkok?

02:26.146 --> 02:30.358
No. The AI just turned off
the oxygen in the airlock.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.110
We'll be out in two minutes.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.111
Oh my goodness!

02:33.194 --> 02:35.113
I think we're doing this the wrong way.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.873
Instead of blasting the door out,

02:44.956 --> 02:47.709
we should be pulling on it
and using the weight of the sea.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.793
Launching out after us
even though they can't swim.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.004
Yeah. Makes me a little proud.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.591
[gasps] Sudarikov's base
is gonna reach Bangkok in a half hour.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.593
If just one AI car gets there,

03:38.676 --> 03:41.137
the Toretto Virus
will live and breed forever.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.681
Seriously, can we just talk about
changing the name?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.433
Can you send your anti-viral code

03:45.516 --> 03:47.602
to Bangkok
to inoculate against the AI attack?

03:47.685 --> 03:50.438
Send it to who? The Bangkok computer god?

03:50.521 --> 03:51.856
Bro, I knew it!

03:52.440 --> 03:54.150
Oh… You're joking?

03:54.234 --> 03:57.528
No one can stop that virus
from infecting once it hits.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.865
That's why it's never gonna get there.
I'm calling in an air strike.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.452
That underwater car factory is going down.

04:04.535 --> 04:08.748
Yeah! Scramble the fighters!
I always wanted to say that. [laughs]

04:29.560 --> 04:31.854
Target sighted. Turning for firing run.

04:44.158 --> 04:47.745
You got to be kidding.
The car factory has missiles!

04:47.829 --> 04:49.372
Raptor one and two, eject!

04:59.716 --> 05:03.594

two of our jets. But the third…

but not striking.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.500
[Frostee] It's all good.

06:15.583 --> 06:20.088
You were just infected with an AI virus
created by a diabolical Russian.

06:20.171 --> 06:24.425
But I vaccinated your jet, so
you're fighting for the good guys again.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.595
What? What's happening?
I still don't have control.

06:27.678 --> 06:31.599

We're Spy Racers!

06:38.356 --> 06:42.068
[dramatic music plays]

06:42.151 --> 06:45.988
Okay, we've got one fighter with
two missiles, the hauler, and our cars.

06:46.072 --> 06:46.906
What do we do now?

06:46.989 --> 06:49.659
We take that car factory boat thing down!

06:49.742 --> 06:52.578
I think we all know that.
The question is how?

06:52.662 --> 06:56.457
That AI is all Toretto. It will do
anything to accomplish its mission.

06:56.541 --> 07:00.002
Even the craziest, most life-threatening,
idiotic maneuvers you can think of.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.630
-Aw. Thanks, Layla.
-[sighs]

07:02.713 --> 07:06.300
But we've got the advantage,
because we know how Toretto thinks.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.512
Also, the original Toretto
has something the AI Toretto doesn't.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.429
A family.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.183
That's right. There's only one team
that's ever stopped Tony.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.143
Us.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.771
-So how do you stop a Toretto?
-We got to think…

07:19.439 --> 07:21.357
Hm… [sighs]

07:22.567 --> 07:24.485
Do we just have to sit here
while we think?

07:24.569 --> 07:26.946
I want to, like, jump something,
or ram something.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.323
-That's it!
-Yes! Wait, what's it?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.701
That's how you stop him. By thinking.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.537
Tony, if you were going to infect Bangkok,
what would you do?

07:34.620 --> 07:35.830
I'd head straight for it.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.958
Smash through every obstacle,
then jump over every other obstacle.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.919
Isn't that, like,
double the actual number of obstacles?

07:42.003 --> 07:45.089
Never mind. That's exactly
what the AI will try to do.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.383
Sudarikov created a brain based on Tony.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.178
It's a doer, an attacker.
That's its weakness.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.512
I think I got a plan.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.097

07:53.181 --> 07:54.432
[Layla] First things first.

Toretto can never back away from a fight,
so let's start Toretto versus Toretto.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.354
[Tony] Finally!

08:01.481 --> 08:04.150
Lookie there, sir!
The kids made it out of your base.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.776
Yeah. Hooray…

08:05.860 --> 08:07.737
[Rusty] And there's old Tony Toretto.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.073
Man, I'll tell you,
that fella's really got nine lives.

08:11.157 --> 08:15.161
Which, of course, is a reference to
the Egyptian sun god, Atum-Ra.

08:15.244 --> 08:18.998
You know, in some regions of Spain,
they say cats have seven lives.

-Woohoo!

08:20.500 --> 08:22.877
Alright, virus! You want the Toretto name?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.713
You got to fight for it.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.393
Hey, yeah! Whoo!

08:41.979 --> 08:44.690
[Tony] Yeah, yes! Whoo!

08:45.650 --> 08:47.652
Where you at? You scared?

08:53.199 --> 08:54.700
Nope, not scared.

Yeah!

09:12.301 --> 09:13.636
Come on!

09:16.973 --> 09:20.393
[Layla] While Tony does his thing,
we'll attack the base on multiple fronts,

09:20.476 --> 09:22.812
so the AI can't focus on any one thing.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.231

09:37.535 --> 09:38.995
Okay, I think we made it mad.

-Well, I could just go home.
-[Frostee] No, I might need you later!

10:02.059 --> 10:04.020
Okay, let's get these subs going.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.150
Maybe speed it up a little?

10:09.734 --> 10:13.654

this thing was constantly evolving?

10:15.823 --> 10:20.119
Got it. Cisco, you have the conn.
They'll respond to your verbal command.

from captain to fleet commander so fast!

13:42.738 --> 13:44.532
Looks like the base is chasing us.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.992
It can't resist blowing us up
on the way to Thailand.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.704
Seems pretty into blowing me up too.
This time I think it might actually do it.

Oh no! The base is trying to
use missiles to infect Thailand,

the same way it infected this jet!

Okay, you got to admit,

to take this base down?

We're good to go. Charges are set.

How could you think you could possibly
land that car on a moving hauler sub?

16:03.087 --> 16:05.339
I do stuff like that all the time!

16:05.422 --> 16:08.592
-Seems crazy to me.
-Just get in the hauler, Toretto.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.510

It looks like the base is triggering
some kind of self-destruct mechanism.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.218
I try to take control, I…

21:01.301 --> 21:03.929
I have to learn not to be so rigid!

21:04.012 --> 21:06.765
A relationship is like a villain's lair.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.017
It needs to have a strong structure,

21:09.101 --> 21:12.688

where it's most vulnerable.

Hey, the only reason
it was the Toretto Virus

21:34.167 --> 21:36.086
is because I was the best driver.

Did you not learn anything
from this whole thing?

21:44.678 --> 21:47.806
The Toretto Virus represented you,
by yourself,

21:47.889 --> 21:51.768
and it got beat because it didn't have
a family like the real Toretto did.

21:51.852 --> 21:52.936
Do you not get that?
