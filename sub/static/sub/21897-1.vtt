00:02.570 --> 00:05.162
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:05.239 --> 00:06.905
welcome to the weigh-in

00:06.953 --> 00:09.671
for tomorrow night's
Battle in Ballarat!

00:09.796 --> 00:13.780
Mickey! Mickey!

00:13.828 --> 00:15.945
The fight of the year,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:15.996 --> 00:19.758
between the former light heavyweight
champion of Australia,

00:19.826 --> 00:21.834
the 10-year veteran,

00:21.927 --> 00:23.253
the bad boy,

00:23.301 --> 00:28.022
the mad boy, Ballarat's own
Mad Mickey Harris!

00:28.690 --> 00:31.290
Yeah, Mickey! Yeah, baby!

00:32.462 --> 00:37.415
Versus the ex-junior welterweight
state champion,

00:37.463 --> 00:38.591
the challenger,

00:38.639 --> 00:42.998
the King of Collingwood,
Raging Ray Davis!

00:47.524 --> 00:49.565
Mad Mickey to weigh in first.

00:54.994 --> 00:58.154
Mickey Ellis, 13 stone 5.

01:02.555 --> 01:04.805
Raging Ray to weigh in now.

01:09.041 --> 01:12.321
Ray Davis, 12 stone 4.

01:16.986 --> 01:18.532
Hey, where's the rest of ya?

01:18.680 --> 01:20.251
Enough to knock you off, eh, punchy.

01:20.321 --> 01:21.879
Buy your tickets,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:21.927 --> 01:25.095
Tomorrow night at the Grand.
Don't miss out.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.594
How about a pose for the cameras,
eh, boys? Give 'em a pose?

01:39.727 --> 01:41.330
Ah, Flanagan.

01:42.365 --> 01:44.623
You little leprechaun, eh?

01:49.605 --> 01:51.208
Enough!

01:52.981 --> 01:55.661
Tomorrow night you are a dead man.

01:58.835 --> 02:02.716
Your kind are not supposed to be
up here, Lou.

02:16.042 --> 02:17.886
Come on!

02:20.978 --> 02:22.884
Come on!

02:24.685 --> 02:26.884
Come on!
Move your feet!

02:28.057 --> 02:29.907
Come on baby, hit him!

02:44.275 --> 02:46.633
They're certainly
not holding back, eh?

02:46.717 --> 02:49.837
Come on! Get... get off me!

02:50.035 --> 02:52.509
You're bleeding. Sit! Sit!

02:53.501 --> 02:56.353
You're doing well, eh.
You got the hit in.

02:57.299 --> 02:58.829
There's still no sign of Flanagan?

02:58.915 --> 03:02.798
You just keep jabbing that eye.
Alright, jabbing that eye?

03:18.470 --> 03:21.282
You stay on him, OK? You stay on him
and you stay focused.

03:21.347 --> 03:23.079
I can't tell Ray.

03:23.165 --> 03:25.298
I still find it hard
to watch him fight.

03:25.346 --> 03:26.633
I can understand that.

03:26.681 --> 03:29.579
If I didn't know Bernie was looking
out for him, I'd be a wreck.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.589
Remember what we talked about, son.

03:31.715 --> 03:33.063
You can do it!

03:38.550 --> 03:39.979
Fight.

04:00.797 --> 04:04.139
I think he's had enough.
We should call it, eh?

04:12.125 --> 04:14.582
Move your feet!
Gus, we need to stop this.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.962
Guard up. Guard up!

04:22.433 --> 04:24.903
Something's wrong. Stop the fight!

04:28.189 --> 04:30.179
Stop the bloody fight!

04:43.721 --> 04:45.391
Give me some room, Gus.

It's going to be OK.

Let's get these off you.

05:54.389 --> 05:56.340
Ray! You alright?

05:56.388 --> 05:57.651
What do you think?

05:57.728 --> 05:58.793
I am sorry.

05:58.870 --> 06:00.632
Sure as hell didn't see that coming.

06:00.709 --> 06:02.450
Now the police will want
to speak with you,

06:02.527 --> 06:05.426
- but you just tell them the truth...
- Just not you.

06:05.590 --> 06:08.970
No. No, no, someone else.

06:09.267 --> 06:10.272
Charlie.

06:10.525 --> 06:11.872
Yeah, yeah.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.219
- I'll check in later, alright?
- Thanks, Charlie.

06:22.339 --> 06:24.648
Ah, Bill, Charlie.

06:28.025 --> 06:29.666
Tell me, how's your brother?

06:29.963 --> 06:32.250
Ah, he's pretty shaken up, Doc.

06:32.327 --> 06:34.353
To be expected.

06:34.525 --> 06:36.407
So, who's in charge?
Frank still in Melbourne?

06:36.455 --> 06:38.463
- Not due back till tomorrow.
- Right.

06:39.974 --> 06:41.401
Get your hands off me, Gus!

06:41.470 --> 06:43.080
Bastard!
What you are talking about it?

06:43.128 --> 06:45.939
You cheated. And you!
You murdered him!

06:45.989 --> 06:47.517
That's enough.
Nobody cheated.

06:47.627 --> 06:49.799
Where's your cornerman, huh?
Why has he run away?

06:49.847 --> 06:52.890
Why? Why? Because he's hiding,
like a little mouse.

06:53.087 --> 06:55.056
Charlie, take him outside.

07:01.949 --> 07:03.890
He was fighting up a weight class.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.700
A younger boxer, though.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.717
Are you alright?

07:17.863 --> 07:20.541
Alice, these all the personal items?

07:20.705 --> 07:24.014
That's all that came with him.
Nothing too unusual.

07:24.091 --> 07:26.549
There's some powder on the trousers.

07:26.626 --> 07:29.614
Looks like chalk.
Or talcum powder, perhaps.

07:29.744 --> 07:31.859
I'll have it tested.
Very good.

07:32.861 --> 07:35.153
Dear, oh, dear.

07:35.345 --> 07:37.502
I wonder if anyone's told her.

07:37.650 --> 07:39.970
She wasn't there to cheer him on.

07:40.094 --> 07:41.816
Maybe she doesn't like boxing.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.744
Two men punching each other
senseless

07:43.792 --> 07:45.775
doesn't appeal to me, either.

07:47.230 --> 07:50.713
Alice, do you know I'm finally
getting used to your haircut

07:50.761 --> 07:53.213
and I have to say,
it's really rather nice.

07:54.118 --> 07:55.404
More practical.

07:55.590 --> 07:57.770
Plus, I'm attempting to do more
things that scare me.

07:57.847 --> 07:59.135
Embracing change.

07:59.201 --> 08:01.814
- Haircuts scare you?
- Hairdressers.

08:02.134 --> 08:04.066
All that unsolicited touching.

08:06.394 --> 08:07.596
Right.

08:07.713 --> 08:11.424
Male, late 20s, athletic, obviously.

08:11.622 --> 08:14.665
- Laceration above the left eye.
- Old wound.

08:14.734 --> 08:16.135
Opened up during the bout.

08:16.247 --> 08:20.090
Bruising to the face and torso,
consistent with the fight,

08:20.167 --> 08:23.090
and this laceration
on the right hand.

08:23.338 --> 08:28.619
Ah, well, boxers can get abrasions
under their gloves,

08:28.744 --> 08:30.330
but this looks...

08:30.463 --> 08:31.813
..bear with me.

08:35.087 --> 08:39.017
- Yes, teeth marks.
- A bite?

08:39.119 --> 08:45.658
Well, not teeth into skin,
rather skin into teeth.

08:46.947 --> 08:48.830
Without his gloves on?

08:52.747 --> 08:55.025
Nothing to do with what went on
here yesterday.

08:55.073 --> 08:57.075
I don't want anyone stitched up.

08:57.924 --> 08:59.549
- Charlie!
- Hey.

08:59.658 --> 09:03.112
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Mum said you were here.

09:03.189 --> 09:05.018
No, I just wanted to make sure
Ray was alright.

09:05.065 --> 09:07.105
We thought we might have left
some gear behind here,

09:07.167 --> 09:10.131
but it looks like we took it
back to the hotel after all.

09:10.208 --> 09:11.393
Oh, well.

09:11.470 --> 09:12.912
I was just checking in.

09:12.989 --> 09:15.040
Ray's just going down to the lake
to have a bit of a run.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.211
You know, clear his head.

09:16.288 --> 09:18.916
Why don't you and I grab
a quick bite? I've got the car.

09:18.964 --> 09:21.213
No, I'm about to go on duty.

09:21.309 --> 09:23.619
We'll drop you off at the police
station anyway, hmm?

09:26.629 --> 09:28.994
Feel like a beer later?
I don't drink when I'm training.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.570
It'd be good to talk, Ray.

09:31.647 --> 09:32.952
Catch up.

09:33.052 --> 09:35.723
I'm all caught up, thanks anyway.

09:37.829 --> 09:40.739
- Everything alright here?
- Yes, officer.

09:44.470 --> 09:46.353
Plaque jaune.

09:46.430 --> 09:49.260
Indicative of bruising in the brain
over the long term.

09:49.331 --> 09:50.335
Fascinating.

09:50.383 --> 09:51.488
And look here,

09:51.703 --> 09:54.010
bleeding between the dura
and the brain.

09:54.069 --> 09:55.597
Acute subdural haematoma.

09:55.689 --> 09:57.979
Usually result of blunt force.

09:59.909 --> 10:03.010
Gosh, he certainly took a hiding
in those latter stages.

10:04.056 --> 10:06.596
But most of the damage was sustained

10:06.767 --> 10:11.112
after he lost motor control,
but once his defences were down.

10:11.189 --> 10:12.531
Two causes of death?

10:12.608 --> 10:16.061
Mickey suffered both cardiac failure
and a subdural haematoma.

10:16.109 --> 10:18.805
I suspect he sustained
the brain injury

10:18.914 --> 10:20.852
just after he had the heart attack.

10:20.914 --> 10:24.000
Well, so... so
he didn't die from Ray's punch?

10:24.187 --> 10:27.672
Charlie, I can't rule it out
conclusively just yet.

10:27.749 --> 10:29.752
Doctor Harvey needs
to complete her tests.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.531
I need to examine
Mickey's medical records.

10:31.608 --> 10:34.232
Doc, if he had a heart problem,

10:34.309 --> 10:36.164
then surely everyone would have
known about it.

10:36.229 --> 10:38.215
Not necessarily.

10:38.550 --> 10:41.432
Also, there are abrasions
on Mickey's knuckles,

10:41.517 --> 10:44.344
I believe from hitting someone
prior to the actual bout...

10:44.392 --> 10:45.415
Come on, we all saw what happened.

10:45.462 --> 10:46.656
Let's close this down.

10:46.829 --> 10:48.810
For Ray's sake,
let's just put an end to it.

10:48.887 --> 10:49.979
Sarge?

10:50.749 --> 10:52.326
Oh, what's he done?

10:52.397 --> 10:53.440
Thieving?

10:53.510 --> 10:54.793
No, he's come in to...

10:54.870 --> 10:55.872
I brought myself in.

10:55.949 --> 10:58.240
I thought the police might be
interested in some evidence.

10:58.288 --> 10:59.554
Evidence?

11:00.201 --> 11:01.593
Evidence of what?

11:01.670 --> 11:03.600
I found 'em behind the Grand.

11:08.466 --> 11:09.816
Plaster wraps.

11:13.686 --> 11:16.775
You put plaster of Paris
on the bandages.

11:16.852 --> 11:19.139
The sweat makes it set hard.

11:20.888 --> 11:24.239
Gives a stronger punch.
Why didn't you show me these before?

11:24.309 --> 11:26.149
You're the brother of the bloke
who wore them.

11:26.226 --> 11:27.876
I wouldn't want them
to magically disappear.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.055
Why bring 'em in now?

11:29.132 --> 11:32.073
Because I don't want to get
stitched up. There's witnesses here.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.451
You used to be Mickey Ellis' coach,
didn't you?

11:34.499 --> 11:35.544
Yes.

11:35.592 --> 11:37.579
Maybe you're trying to fit up
the other guy.

11:38.829 --> 11:40.979
Do what you want with them.
I've done my bit.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.410
If these are Ray's, then
he'll definitely be up for charges.

11:46.487 --> 11:47.814
Well, hang on a minute,

11:47.891 --> 11:50.611
if it was in fact Ray's punch
that killed Mickey.

11:50.688 --> 11:52.272
OK, I'll talk to Ray.

11:52.349 --> 11:54.404
You find the cornerman.
What's his name?

11:54.452 --> 11:57.700
- Ah, Flanagan.
- Yes.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.232
Doctor Spencer can help you,

12:02.309 --> 12:04.272
not that Mickey went there
too often.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.583
Thank you, I'll call him.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.857
Gus, I also wanted to ask
you about...

12:07.905 --> 12:08.949
Move!

12:08.997 --> 12:11.211
I also wanted to ask you about
teeth marks

12:11.259 --> 12:12.843
we found on Mickey's hand.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.250
Now you saw them too.

12:14.327 --> 12:17.393
Before the fight. Inside!

12:17.461 --> 12:19.778
Before the...?
So he had another fight?

12:19.826 --> 12:20.851
Did you ask him about it?

12:20.928 --> 12:23.832
I asked, but he does not answer.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.713
Your feet! Use your feet!

12:25.790 --> 12:28.693
Do you have any idea
where he was before the match?

12:28.897 --> 12:31.841
Well, he was supposed to be resting.
That was the rules.

12:31.889 --> 12:35.451
But you know Mickey and the rules,
they're not the best of friends.

12:35.569 --> 12:38.395
- Your feet! Move your feet.
- Gus, tell me.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.552
Had he been experiencing
head-aches or blackouts?

12:41.629 --> 12:44.672
What about his behaviour?
Was he more erratic, more...

12:44.749 --> 12:46.014
..more volatile of late?

12:46.091 --> 12:47.570
Well, he was always that way.

12:47.647 --> 12:51.050
Always making enemies,
always leaving a mess for me to fix.

12:51.127 --> 12:53.752
He was a mad dog, but a good boxer.

12:53.829 --> 12:55.131
Now move! Lead it!

12:55.208 --> 12:56.432
Even...
Good!

12:56.509 --> 12:59.568
Even the best fighters can only take
so much punishment, Ray.

12:59.616 --> 13:02.599
Well, he wanted to keep going.
He had to.

13:02.647 --> 13:05.472
He was going to get married.
Into him!

13:05.670 --> 13:08.252
And it was the only way
he could make money, yes?

13:08.408 --> 13:12.100
Boxing is one of the few jobs
where mad dogs are appreciated.

13:12.829 --> 13:14.259
Go. Inside!

13:22.150 --> 13:24.179
Oh! Look who's here. G'day, son.

13:25.150 --> 13:26.500
Mum.

13:27.144 --> 13:28.826
Bernie, I need a quick chat.

13:28.896 --> 13:30.614
Oh, sure. Pull up a chair.

13:30.691 --> 13:32.300
Well, it's police business.

13:34.122 --> 13:40.259
Oh, right. Why don't I just fix up
the bill and be back in a sec?

13:50.031 --> 13:52.193
You haven't seen
Sean Flanagan, I suppose?

13:52.300 --> 13:54.424
Bernie has his faults, Charlie.

13:54.696 --> 13:56.121
But he's a good man.

13:56.191 --> 13:59.216
Dad charged him for... for
fraud, wasn't it?

13:59.356 --> 14:02.858
People change. He cares about us.

14:03.271 --> 14:04.638
And you.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.291
No offence, Mum,
but he doesn't know me.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.570
Rightio. Won't be long, love.

14:09.647 --> 14:11.820
Yeah, won't be long.

14:15.208 --> 14:18.271
Look, I've been trying
to cheer your Mum up, but it's hard.

14:18.470 --> 14:20.334
She's really worried about all this.

14:20.411 --> 14:23.170
You haven't seen Sean Flanagan
this morning, have you?

14:23.247 --> 14:25.841
No, no, hasn't surfaced.
But he'll show up.

14:25.926 --> 14:27.950
Yeah. Yeah.

14:28.309 --> 14:32.341
Bernie, I need to ask about Ray.

14:32.661 --> 14:34.553
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

14:34.670 --> 14:37.073
I tell you what,
though, that kid is good.

14:37.150 --> 14:39.107
I mean, I reckon
he'd go all the way to the top.

14:39.216 --> 14:40.521
Oh, yeah?
Mm.

14:40.569 --> 14:42.021
By cheating?

14:43.199 --> 14:46.146
The plaster wraps.
I take it they were your idea?

14:46.626 --> 14:47.811
Yes.

14:48.029 --> 14:50.780
Bruising evident on both hands...

14:52.480 --> 14:54.396
..and grazes on the knuckles.

14:55.857 --> 14:57.990
Wouldn't have bled too much. Still...

14:59.329 --> 15:01.440
..enough to stain these.

15:03.550 --> 15:06.690
Ray and I found them after we took
his gloves off, after the fight.

15:06.845 --> 15:07.990
Oh, after?

15:08.038 --> 15:10.090
Yeah, after. Neither of us knew
anything beforehand.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.775
Ohh!
Yeah.

15:11.852 --> 15:13.491
Do you think I'm stupid?

15:13.568 --> 15:14.851
Oh, come on, son!

15:14.928 --> 15:16.500
Don't call me son.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.579
Now you're telling me
you had no idea?

15:21.318 --> 15:22.841
I didn't put them on.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.531
Myself. I mean, you can't really.

15:26.608 --> 15:28.020
So who did?

15:29.509 --> 15:32.272
It was Flanagan.
I thought he wasn't there.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.699
He wasn't there ringside, no,

15:33.747 --> 15:35.979
but he was in the change room
before the fight.

15:37.029 --> 15:41.112
It must have been obvious to you,
what Flanagan was up to.

15:41.189 --> 15:43.153
It's obvious when the plaster sets.

15:43.230 --> 15:44.651
But before that it's just powder.

15:44.728 --> 15:46.312
So you genuinely believed,

15:46.389 --> 15:48.552
you genuinely believed
it was talcum powder?

15:48.600 --> 15:50.211
I didn't have a reason not to.

15:50.288 --> 15:53.010
So Flanagan was there
to do the wraps. Then what?

15:53.087 --> 15:54.312
Well, just that.

15:54.389 --> 15:56.651
I mean,
we're pushing towards the ring

15:56.719 --> 15:59.333
and I turn around
and there he was, gone.

15:59.381 --> 16:00.598
Didn't you find that odd?

16:00.646 --> 16:02.570
Well, of course, I did,
but there was a fight on.

16:02.618 --> 16:04.506
I could hardly go looking for him.

16:04.732 --> 16:06.090
When I found the plaster,

16:06.167 --> 16:09.450
I figured he'd just shot through
because of that.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.773
So where is he?

16:13.909 --> 16:15.339
I don't know.

16:28.368 --> 16:31.037
Ray. Hey!

16:32.790 --> 16:34.179
How'd it go?

16:35.230 --> 16:36.832
It's a bloody nightmare.

16:36.909 --> 16:39.931
Yeah, look, I'm sorry,
I couldn't be in there with you.

16:40.008 --> 16:42.500
- You're family, so...
- Is that right?

16:44.430 --> 16:47.140
Listen, we need to talk.

16:47.188 --> 16:49.450
I'm worried about you,
with everything that's happened.

16:49.527 --> 16:52.050
I've done my interview, Sergeant.

16:52.127 --> 16:53.765
Nothing else to say.

16:54.043 --> 16:55.366
Hey!

16:55.546 --> 16:57.757
Would you stop acting
like a child for just one minute?

16:57.805 --> 17:00.187
You don't get to talk to me
like that anymore.

17:11.909 --> 17:14.153
Mickey's medical records.

17:14.230 --> 17:17.330
Hopefully, they'll tell us more
than the preliminary blood tests.

17:17.415 --> 17:19.901
They're telling me he was fit.

17:19.971 --> 17:21.339
Fit as a fiddle.

17:22.348 --> 17:24.290
You didn't find anything?

17:24.367 --> 17:25.872
No infections.

17:25.964 --> 17:29.554
No problems with the kidneys,
thyroid. Nothing.

17:30.790 --> 17:34.775
So a perfectly healthy young man
suffers a loss of motor control

17:34.852 --> 17:37.139
and dies suddenly of heart failure.

17:40.029 --> 17:42.539
With no other indications.

17:44.283 --> 17:45.393
Poison.

17:45.462 --> 17:46.963
Given the lack of any other symptoms,

17:47.019 --> 17:49.581
it's the most probable cause
of his heart attack.

17:49.644 --> 17:51.207
So you're not certain?

17:51.268 --> 17:52.774
No, not yet.

17:53.015 --> 17:56.596
But I really don't think
Ray's punch killed Mickey.

17:56.728 --> 17:58.783
- So what do we do now?
- Well...

17:58.932 --> 18:02.890
That's not something you want to ask
out loud too often there, Sergeant.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.793
Bloody hell.

18:04.870 --> 18:07.565
Matthew Lawson,
what are you doing here?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.486
Boss, good to see you.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.478
Well, you might
change your mind soon enough.

18:12.570 --> 18:13.994
Ah, sir?

18:14.174 --> 18:16.713
Frank Carlyle
won't be coming back.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.780
I've been brought in to take over.

18:20.389 --> 18:23.611
So, Melbourne's filled me in on this
Mickey Ellis.

18:23.688 --> 18:24.970
What's the latest?

18:25.047 --> 18:27.619
Ah, well, he was poisoned.

18:28.550 --> 18:31.432
But we don't know how or what with.

18:31.509 --> 18:33.272
What we do know is this -

18:33.349 --> 18:34.979
he fought hard for eight rounds,

18:35.027 --> 18:36.455
he died in the ninth.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.010
Now I suspect the poison
was administered in the break.

18:40.087 --> 18:43.179
Of course,
I need to test everything.

18:44.964 --> 18:46.985
Plenty of people with opportunity.

18:47.047 --> 18:48.460
Afraid so.

18:49.230 --> 18:52.739
Ah, I'm sorry, Charlie,
you might want to give that a miss.

18:54.968 --> 18:58.822
"Ray Davis killed another man
but today is walking free,

18:58.963 --> 19:02.770
"possibly because Ray is the brother
of Sergeant Charlie Davis.

19:02.847 --> 19:05.260
"Were raised
in the Collingwood slums.

19:05.346 --> 19:08.674
"Their father Norm Davis was killed
in the line of duty."

19:09.949 --> 19:11.377
Oh, Rose.

19:14.701 --> 19:16.408
I'm sorry. Um...

19:16.997 --> 19:19.502
Matthew, where's your...? Ah, here.

19:19.983 --> 19:21.254
Charlie, may I...?

19:22.507 --> 19:24.430
Ah, yes, now look.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.552
Look at his hand. No teeth marks.

19:27.629 --> 19:29.713
He got them after the weigh-in.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.511
Well, Flanagan had
a hell of a temper on him.

19:31.558 --> 19:34.385
My word. Poisoning someone.

19:34.776 --> 19:37.096
Now, gives you a hell of a reason
to want to disappear, eh?

19:37.144 --> 19:38.916
Right, well let's get cracking.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.511
Step up the search
for this Flanagan.

19:40.559 --> 19:42.170
Davis, you go with the Doctor.

19:45.790 --> 19:47.100
So...

19:48.749 --> 19:51.770
- ..Frank Carlyle?
- Oh, he's in a world of trouble.

19:51.979 --> 19:53.164
And you're...?

19:53.382 --> 19:54.933
Oh, perfectly fine.

19:56.983 --> 19:58.370
Mr Flanagan!

20:00.590 --> 20:02.901
Yeah, open it.

20:05.781 --> 20:07.624
Someone left in a hurry.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.634
Don't step in it.
We'll get a sample.

20:14.109 --> 20:16.539
Right, Charlie, here we are.

20:18.709 --> 20:21.393
Only just been cleaned,
by the looks.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.003
Must be bins somewhere, Charlie.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.192
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll head out back.
- Good man.

20:35.709 --> 20:38.059
Do we know if Mr Flanagan has a car?

20:39.590 --> 20:41.579
A yellow Holden van.

20:42.527 --> 20:43.837
Call it in.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.952
You certainly are a fight fan.
It's not on till tomorrow night.

20:56.029 --> 20:57.611
I'm surprised it's happening at all.

20:57.688 --> 21:00.198
Well, the coach is a bit of a shark.
Ah, Bernie.

21:00.246 --> 21:02.378
I meant Mickey's coach, Gus Jansons.

21:02.487 --> 21:04.393
He coaches King Connolly as well.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.730
They're just rumours.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.101
Mind you,
there are rumours about Bernie, too.

21:08.256 --> 21:09.801
Rumours...

21:10.074 --> 21:13.145
Speaking of which,
I saw this morning's front page.

21:14.071 --> 21:16.260
So did Charlie, just by the way.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.932
It was lovely seeing Jean
the other night.

21:20.026 --> 21:21.590
She seems very happy.

21:21.638 --> 21:23.823
Does she? That's good.

21:23.922 --> 21:25.018
Rose, since you're here,

21:25.091 --> 21:28.167
I'm trying to remember exactly
who was where during the fight.

21:28.215 --> 21:30.807
Now, of course, I was here. You
were here with me during the break.

21:30.854 --> 21:32.534
Well, I was moving around
everywhere, so...

21:32.582 --> 21:33.635
Of course.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.838
It's gone to the tip, Doc.

21:35.953 --> 21:37.605
I'll send...

21:40.017 --> 21:42.060
..I'll send someone down there.

21:42.309 --> 21:44.979
It would help if we had an idea of
what we're looking for, but...

21:45.027 --> 21:46.709
Yes, yes, very good, Charlie.

21:46.805 --> 21:50.635
Um, listen, fight night,
you were with your Mum and Jean, yes?

21:50.856 --> 21:52.307
Yeah.

21:52.909 --> 21:54.581
Over there.
Right.

21:54.768 --> 21:58.831
Directly behind Ray's corner.
Who else was with him? Um...

21:58.886 --> 22:01.626
Bernie.
Yeah, it was just Ray and Bernie.

22:03.629 --> 22:05.259
Right.

22:07.350 --> 22:08.392
Not now.

22:08.453 --> 22:11.038
And we've been told Flanagan
was out the back,

22:11.086 --> 22:12.639
nowhere near the ring.

22:12.838 --> 22:14.639
Rose, did you see anyone else?

22:14.687 --> 22:16.405
No, just Ray and Bernie.

22:18.537 --> 22:19.739
Alright.

22:19.949 --> 22:23.678
Over here, of course, Mickey, Gus.

22:23.780 --> 22:27.020
- Ah, their cornerman, um, Lou Dixon.
- Yeah.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.888
Yeah, it was just them
in the blue corner, Doc.

22:31.944 --> 22:33.476
Look, we should probably
head to work now...

22:33.523 --> 22:37.247
No, actually you're wrong.
Mickey's fiance was there as well.

22:37.311 --> 22:38.460
She was?

22:38.523 --> 22:41.842
Yes, the brunette. She came
to the ropes at every break.

22:42.430 --> 22:43.575
Brunette.

22:43.652 --> 22:45.460
Not a blonde.

22:55.721 --> 22:58.200
So you went to all of
Mickey's fights?

23:00.089 --> 23:02.599
Yes. When he'd let me.

23:02.708 --> 23:04.912
Did you always sit
so close to his corner?

23:05.223 --> 23:07.002
You had a front row seat
the other night.

23:07.050 --> 23:09.450
I was his fiance. Why wouldn't I?

23:09.599 --> 23:11.867
Close to his bottles and towels.

23:13.224 --> 23:15.599
Did you help out during the fight?

23:15.753 --> 23:18.335
I picked up the pieces afterwards.

23:18.466 --> 23:20.268
So no?

23:20.392 --> 23:21.466
No.

23:21.544 --> 23:23.419
What about before the fight?

23:25.794 --> 23:27.575
Is he allowed to be here?

23:27.742 --> 23:29.404
Just answer the question,
Miss Corelli.

23:29.452 --> 23:31.503
Did you see your fiance
before the fight?

23:32.771 --> 23:34.619
I never saw him before a fight.

23:36.239 --> 23:38.259
Mickey had to rest.

23:39.629 --> 23:41.579
No temptation.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.466
It was the coach's rule.

23:44.686 --> 23:46.428
So what did Mickey think about that?

23:46.489 --> 23:47.793
Mickey loved me.

23:47.880 --> 23:51.341
Once we were married, he was going
to retire and settle down here.

23:51.389 --> 23:52.825
Had you set a date?

23:54.138 --> 23:57.059
He put it off. Always another fight.

23:58.216 --> 24:00.357
Anyone could see Mickey
was getting worse.

24:00.412 --> 24:03.193
His mind, you know?
It was time to...

24:03.989 --> 24:05.700
But he had other people in his ear.

24:05.793 --> 24:06.885
Who?

24:10.230 --> 24:12.060
Miss Corelli,
I know this is difficult,

24:12.108 --> 24:14.431
but we found this
in Mickey's wallet.

24:16.777 --> 24:18.127
Do you know her?

24:19.306 --> 24:21.215
But you knew there was someone.

24:23.187 --> 24:24.497
No.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.786
- She knew about the blonde woman.
- Yeah.

24:33.919 --> 24:36.590
Oi, stop the car. Reverse up.

24:49.376 --> 24:51.411
Not far from Tracey's.

24:51.525 --> 24:56.936
Yeah, but not far from the train
station, either.

25:05.473 --> 25:06.903
Bill.

25:09.242 --> 25:10.913
What is it?

25:15.274 --> 25:17.552
I'm guessing it's plaster of Paris.

25:18.749 --> 25:21.353
I have other fighters
depending on me.

25:21.401 --> 25:24.583
When I start this business,
it was from nothing.

25:24.714 --> 25:28.076
If these fights stop,
I go back to nothing.

25:28.124 --> 25:29.977
Back to the sheep.

25:30.669 --> 25:31.849
Back to the sheep?

25:31.948 --> 25:36.138
It's something I say,
like a fighter's motivation.

25:36.186 --> 25:37.685
My family have a farm back home.

25:37.733 --> 25:38.816
Sheep, sheep, sheep.

25:38.954 --> 25:43.380
I see. So boxing changed your life,
perhaps even saved you.

25:43.728 --> 25:45.185
Thank God.

25:45.389 --> 25:46.763
Though it does not save everyone.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.689
Look, this is all
I have here from the fight.

25:48.737 --> 25:50.958
There may be more things
down in the lockers.

25:51.188 --> 25:55.341
Alright. Ah, one more question,
Gus, if I may.

25:55.424 --> 25:59.774
You said Mickey put people off-side.
Anyone recently?

26:00.661 --> 26:03.950
There was that Irishman, Flanagan.
Probably others.

26:04.090 --> 26:09.333
He was a very difficult man,
but a good fighter, unlike some.

27:07.509 --> 27:09.188
Don't!

27:11.209 --> 27:12.293
Lou!

27:12.373 --> 27:14.021
What are you doing
sneaking around here?

27:14.069 --> 27:16.014
What are you doing?

27:16.189 --> 27:17.473
Do you live here?

27:17.550 --> 27:19.632
I don't have to tell you anything.

27:19.709 --> 27:21.291
If you're worried
about Bernie and Ray,

27:21.368 --> 27:23.491
the police didn't tell them
you found the wraps.

27:23.568 --> 27:24.731
No, they figured it out.

27:24.808 --> 27:27.713
Even if they didn't, Gus would have
made sure they found out.

27:27.790 --> 27:29.010
And why would he do that?

27:29.087 --> 27:30.370
I wanted them suspended.

27:30.447 --> 27:32.112
Gus wanted a new fight.

27:32.189 --> 27:35.380
They decided to bury it.
They told me to shut it.

27:36.157 --> 27:39.592
I'm going to find out
who killed Mickey, I assure you.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.326
Now, can you show me his locker?

27:43.169 --> 27:44.399
Come on.

27:46.949 --> 27:49.491
You used to coach Mickey,
didn't you?

27:49.568 --> 27:50.939
Yes.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.806
Then it must have been disappointing
when he dropped you.

27:54.859 --> 27:57.435
Not enough to kill the bloke
after five years.

27:57.697 --> 27:59.277
I told the coppers all this.

27:59.339 --> 28:03.525
You also told the police you didn't
like Mickey, so why be his cornerman?

28:03.735 --> 28:05.955
To see if I could talk some sense
into the old Mickey,

28:06.003 --> 28:08.127
to get him to get out
before it was too late.

28:08.288 --> 28:09.467
And did you?

28:10.309 --> 28:12.339
I never saw the old Mickey again.

28:15.901 --> 28:17.943
Oh, that's got some bite to it.

28:18.709 --> 28:20.701
Mm.

28:21.070 --> 28:22.365
What is all of this?

28:22.517 --> 28:24.689
Mickey's boxing gear.
Ah.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.967
I thought you might be pulling
the gloves on again.

28:28.208 --> 28:30.193
Ah, very funny.

28:30.270 --> 28:32.460
No, it all needs to be tested.

28:35.230 --> 28:39.820
I, um, I've told
the boys about the engagement.

28:40.904 --> 28:42.432
Ahh.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.474
How did they take it?

28:44.657 --> 28:49.248
Well, Christopher is thrilled.

28:49.785 --> 28:50.998
And Jack?

28:51.520 --> 28:53.064
Jack will get used to it.

28:54.070 --> 28:55.701
I um...

28:56.372 --> 28:59.389
..I sent letters to Mei Lin
and Lee this morning.

29:00.949 --> 29:03.740
Well, not quite so secret now.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.551
Come on, then.

29:28.543 --> 29:31.213
Just give me a minute,
Ned, would you?

29:38.552 --> 29:40.154
What were you thinking?

29:42.991 --> 29:44.274
"Killer Punch".

29:44.430 --> 29:46.450
I wrote the story, Charlie,
not the headline.

29:46.527 --> 29:49.153
Well, should
I thank you for that, then, hm?

29:49.230 --> 29:50.993
For calling my brother a killer,

29:51.070 --> 29:54.153
or telling everyone we grew up
in a slum, or how my father died?

29:54.230 --> 29:57.170
I understand your sensitivity. I may
have got carried away with the slum.

29:57.247 --> 29:59.010
But nothing that I wrote was untrue.

29:59.087 --> 30:01.552
But does that make it right, Rose?

30:01.629 --> 30:05.780
I told you these things
in confidence, as a friend, or...

30:06.683 --> 30:08.624
..whatever we are.

30:08.967 --> 30:10.100
Were.

30:10.776 --> 30:11.857
Charlie, we both agreed

30:11.905 --> 30:14.951
- that we didn't want anything.
- I'm not talking about that, Rose.

30:15.111 --> 30:17.674
I'm talking about
common consideration.

30:17.829 --> 30:20.357
Making Ray's life public
makes my life public.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.076
I was simply doing my job.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

30:23.207 --> 30:24.467
But you did.

30:24.659 --> 30:26.862
And by the way, the autopsy results,

30:27.002 --> 30:28.928
it proved a punch
didn't kill Mickey.

30:28.986 --> 30:31.130
My brother isn't a killer.

30:31.798 --> 30:34.069
I'm glad Ray's been cleared.

30:35.698 --> 30:37.990
But I can only report
what people tell me.

30:38.381 --> 30:40.154
I thought you'd understand.
It's work.

30:40.202 --> 30:41.442
It's not personal.

30:43.270 --> 30:47.140
I don't know, Rose.
It felt pretty personal to me.

30:55.567 --> 30:57.757
Come in, love.
Wait here, Ned.

30:58.619 --> 31:00.760
Hey, uh, any news of Flan?

31:00.808 --> 31:03.232
Uh, still looking.

31:03.506 --> 31:05.651
You here as family, or as a copper?

31:05.810 --> 31:08.179
Ray, put a lid on it.

31:10.217 --> 31:14.460
The autopsy showed that Mickey
didn't die from a punch.

31:15.592 --> 31:17.701
Oh!

31:18.053 --> 31:20.990
- That's, uh...
- Thanks for telling us, mate.

31:22.428 --> 31:26.901
Wow. So, um, what was it, then?
His heart, or...?

31:30.924 --> 31:32.596
He was poisoned.

31:33.414 --> 31:34.827
Murder.

31:35.709 --> 31:37.651
So, what are you here for?

31:38.151 --> 31:40.112
I have to collect your gear
for testing.

31:40.744 --> 31:42.377
Oh, he didn't do anything!
Charlie!

31:42.433 --> 31:43.561
I mean...
I don't have a choice.

31:43.608 --> 31:46.339
- Ray, I'm trying to clear you.
- Take it.

31:56.230 --> 32:00.353
So, a yellow reaction
indicates an alkaloid?

32:00.459 --> 32:04.822
Precisely. Mind you,
not all alkaloids are poisonous.

32:05.252 --> 32:08.859
And not all poisons are alkaloids.
That's right.

32:12.416 --> 32:14.556
Clear as clear can be.

32:14.940 --> 32:15.964
Doc?

32:16.299 --> 32:18.854
Yes, Charlie. Come on in.

32:23.088 --> 32:24.611
My brother's kit.

32:24.807 --> 32:26.232
Thank you.

32:26.627 --> 32:28.593
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

32:28.670 --> 32:30.961
This must be terribly difficult
for you.

32:31.009 --> 32:32.690
You're managing so incredibly well.

32:32.767 --> 32:36.087
Well, I don't really have
much of a choice, do I?

32:36.959 --> 32:38.689
Charlie...

32:42.230 --> 32:44.752
..we won't need to test this.

32:45.282 --> 32:46.913
Why don't you hold onto it?

32:48.288 --> 32:49.999
Yeah.

32:55.865 --> 32:57.496
Yeah, thanks.

33:03.658 --> 33:08.232
Bumped into Rose today,
Charlie and I.

33:08.603 --> 33:13.432
There seemed to be
some tension in the air.

33:13.619 --> 33:15.377
You saw the paper?

33:15.688 --> 33:20.632
Yes. She inquired about you.

33:20.939 --> 33:22.539
Mind you, I have to say...

33:24.055 --> 33:27.058
..I think she was really asking
about us.

33:27.230 --> 33:30.211
We might as well take
an ad out in The Courier.

33:32.634 --> 33:37.095
And at some point, we might have to.

33:37.349 --> 33:41.361
For now, let's just enjoy it,
just... just us.

33:43.611 --> 33:45.059
Oh, dear.

33:58.650 --> 34:00.845
- What are you doing?
- Running.

34:00.962 --> 34:03.303
I need my kit back before the fight.

34:03.931 --> 34:06.205
Why has he got you fighting again
so soon?

34:06.261 --> 34:07.485
It's dangerous, Ray.

34:07.533 --> 34:09.371
Do you know what
you're getting yourself into?

34:09.418 --> 34:12.581
- Of course I know. I'm not a fool.
- Neither is Bernie.

34:12.688 --> 34:16.072
So you do fight after fight,
take beating after beating?

34:16.252 --> 34:18.752
You'll end up as mad as Mickey.
We know what we're doing.

34:18.985 --> 34:20.851
Believe it or not,
we can manage without you.

34:20.928 --> 34:22.250
We've done it for long enough.

34:22.327 --> 34:25.130
Oh, would you just stop acting
like a baby and just tell me

34:25.208 --> 34:26.993
what your problem is?

34:27.322 --> 34:30.632
For starters, Mum's getting married
and she wants your approval.

34:30.813 --> 34:33.485
Well, I'd love to see Mum happy,
but it's Bernie bloody Thompson!

34:33.534 --> 34:35.710
Seeing how Bernie's my coach,
I really don't care.

34:35.759 --> 34:37.487
He's a crook, Ray.

34:37.612 --> 34:40.620
He's using you for all he can get,
and once you're no good to him,

34:40.668 --> 34:42.574
- he'll dump you like the rest of them.
- You don't know him!

34:42.675 --> 34:45.210
You don't know
a thing about him, or us.

34:45.288 --> 34:48.993
Oh yeah? Well, I know he knew
about the plaster wraps.

34:49.117 --> 34:52.396
As if Flanagan would have done them
without Bernie's say so.

34:53.893 --> 34:56.130
Yeah, thought so.

34:57.740 --> 34:59.182
You think you're so smart.

34:59.482 --> 35:01.039
You think you know everything.

35:01.345 --> 35:03.477
Flanagan wasn't even there.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.662
What, you knew about them all along?

35:06.730 --> 35:09.619
Of course I knew, Charlie. Grow up.

35:11.316 --> 35:13.597
Dad would be turning in his grave,
Ray.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.214
Dad was a boxer and he'd understand.
He'd never cheat.

35:16.316 --> 35:18.651
He never would have run away
like you did.

35:18.988 --> 35:21.839
I left to earn money,

35:21.980 --> 35:23.713
- to send back to you...
- Guilt money.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.619
You ran away like a coward.

35:30.281 --> 35:33.541
You ran off, so you lose the right
to tell us what to do.

35:35.109 --> 35:36.939
Why can't you let us get on with it?

35:39.749 --> 35:41.970
Why can't we move on?

35:42.047 --> 35:44.010
We want that.

35:44.149 --> 35:45.762
I want it!

36:12.972 --> 36:14.925
Charlie...

36:22.441 --> 36:26.488
Charlie, I've been waiting for you.
Good run?

36:27.972 --> 36:32.219
Charlie, I need to talk to you.

36:33.163 --> 36:34.993
You've found something.

36:36.800 --> 36:41.902
Yes. On one of Ray's boxing gloves.

36:46.430 --> 36:49.660
Poison. I am so sorry.

36:51.052 --> 36:52.721
His boxing glove?

36:55.082 --> 36:57.907
That wouldn't even work, would it?

36:59.270 --> 37:01.339
I wish that were true.

37:03.222 --> 37:05.410
Charlie,
if you coat something in poison,

37:05.487 --> 37:09.211
in this case a boxing glove,
and you pound it into an open wound,

37:09.574 --> 37:12.619
the poison could enter
the bloodstream.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.795
I'm going to have to tell Mum.

37:17.989 --> 37:20.032
Doesn't mean it was Ray's idea,

37:20.109 --> 37:22.575
and there are still
so many unanswered questions -

37:22.652 --> 37:24.491
Flanagan's whereabouts,
for one thing.

37:24.568 --> 37:26.491
Flanagan wasn't there.

37:26.817 --> 37:28.709
Ray just told me.

37:30.488 --> 37:33.131
Who wrapped his hands?
Bernie.

37:33.464 --> 37:37.136
Ray knew all about it.
They lied to us.

37:41.238 --> 37:42.949
I see.

37:45.189 --> 37:46.731
So, if Flanagan wasn't there...

37:46.808 --> 37:51.347
Yeah, then...
then my brother's the killer.

37:52.850 --> 37:56.173
Dr Harvey's trying to identify
the poison as we speak.

37:56.324 --> 37:58.199
It's a bit of a risky MO, though,
isn't it?

37:58.300 --> 37:59.593
Oh, very.

37:59.670 --> 38:03.611
But whoever applied it knew the skin
above Mickey's eye was weak,

38:03.761 --> 38:07.300
and that it would split again
as soon as he fought.

38:07.558 --> 38:09.386
Now, with the wound open,

38:09.472 --> 38:12.542
he could force the poison
into his system.

38:12.656 --> 38:13.871
Bam.

38:13.989 --> 38:16.035
But now we know that
Flanagan wasn't there.

38:16.270 --> 38:17.628
Any update on that front?

38:17.746 --> 38:20.450
A bloke fitting his description
bought a train ticket to Melbourne.

38:20.527 --> 38:21.793
Nothing definite.

38:22.097 --> 38:25.934
And we sent Dr Harvey the samples
from the hotel room and the van.

38:26.199 --> 38:28.096
If he has a van, why not drive?

38:28.181 --> 38:30.527
Well, he may still be hiding here.

38:30.575 --> 38:31.619
But we don't know where.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.379
And if Ray couldn't have applied
the poison himself,

38:33.426 --> 38:36.097
that leaves us with Bernie Thompson,
so bring him in.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.980
Yes, boss.

38:39.361 --> 38:41.952
I told you, I haven't seen Flanagan.

38:43.160 --> 38:45.042
Since when, exactly?

38:45.238 --> 38:47.393
Since before the fight
in the change room,

38:47.457 --> 38:48.970
when he wrapped Ray's hands.

38:49.047 --> 38:53.250
Thing is, Bernie, Ray told us that
Flanagan wasn't there before,

38:53.327 --> 38:55.542
during or after the fight.

38:57.309 --> 39:01.135
Lying to the police is
a very serious matter, Mr Thompson.

39:01.371 --> 39:04.183
But then you'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

39:04.589 --> 39:06.769
That was a long time ago.

39:09.386 --> 39:11.050
I didn't mean to lie to you...

39:11.269 --> 39:12.690
Just to Charlie, then.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.851
I'm marrying his mother,

39:14.928 --> 39:18.872
and he doesn't seem too keen
on that, or me.

39:19.128 --> 39:20.770
This would just make it worse.

39:20.839 --> 39:22.323
And that matters to you?

39:22.542 --> 39:26.832
Yes, it matters,
because I love Shirley,

39:26.941 --> 39:28.238
and the boys.

39:28.297 --> 39:30.008
I love Ray like a son.

39:30.980 --> 39:34.535
You know,
I can reconsider the charges...

39:36.035 --> 39:38.211
..but I need some answers.

39:38.386 --> 39:40.700
Who wrapped Ray's fists?

39:42.004 --> 39:43.127
I did.

39:43.246 --> 39:45.652
And you put the gloves on.
Yes.

39:47.249 --> 39:49.066
Did you put the poison on the glove?

39:50.136 --> 39:53.432
What?
We found poison on his gloves.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.247
Bernie,
it's how it got into his system.

39:55.294 --> 39:56.541
That was the plan, wasn't it?

39:56.589 --> 39:59.977
Open up the eye, apply the poison
during the break and pound the cut?

40:00.234 --> 40:01.815
I don't know anything about that.

40:01.863 --> 40:03.667
You got Ray to fight
up a weight class.

40:03.824 --> 40:06.531
It's a great way to launch a career,
but also a huge gamble.

40:06.608 --> 40:08.628
You couldn't afford to lose.
You had to win.

40:08.699 --> 40:14.058
Alright, yes, we had to win.
That's why I plastered Ray's fists.

40:14.127 --> 40:15.593
But...

40:15.670 --> 40:17.272
..that's it.

40:17.349 --> 40:21.131
I wouldn't know
how to poison anybody.

40:21.208 --> 40:22.312
Aconitine?

40:22.389 --> 40:26.232
According to toxicology,
derived from the aconitum plant.

40:26.309 --> 40:29.353
Used in trace amounts
as an analgesic liniment.

40:29.430 --> 40:32.193
Even diluted,
you'd need to avoid abrasions.

40:32.270 --> 40:36.131
And the dosage Mickey received was
far more powerful than any liniment.

40:36.208 --> 40:40.042
I also tested the white powder
from his trousers. It's not chalk.

40:40.152 --> 40:43.931
It's calcium sulphate dehydrate.
Gypsum.

40:44.008 --> 40:45.272
Ah.

40:45.349 --> 40:47.851
Which is much the same
as plaster of Paris,

40:47.928 --> 40:49.872
used of course in Ray's wraps.

40:49.949 --> 40:50.952
Almost the same.

40:51.029 --> 40:53.272
Plaster of Paris
is dehydrated gypsum -

40:53.349 --> 40:55.032
calcium sulphate hemihydrate.

40:55.109 --> 40:58.597
Both substances were found
in Mr Flanagan's belongings.

40:58.705 --> 40:59.729
Both?

40:59.777 --> 41:03.010
The bag of plaster of Paris
from the van contained just that,

41:03.087 --> 41:06.810
but the powder from the floor
of his hotel room is raw gypsum.

41:08.621 --> 41:13.112
I understand why he'd have plaster,
but gypsum?

41:13.363 --> 41:16.464
And why would that be
on Mickey's clothes as well?

41:18.070 --> 41:21.739
Anyhow, the priority right now
is the poison.

41:23.597 --> 41:27.675
Jean!
I need your gardening expertise.

41:28.034 --> 41:29.395
Gardening?

41:29.527 --> 41:31.550
They've identified the poison.

41:35.136 --> 41:36.926
Aconitine.

41:38.190 --> 41:41.772
Monks hood. Or some people call it
devil's helmet, or wolfsbane.

41:41.820 --> 41:44.125
It's a pretty flower.
Lovely blue colour.

41:44.249 --> 41:47.175
My father used to use it
to poison foxes.

41:47.896 --> 41:49.753
So you've seen it? Here?

41:49.949 --> 41:52.272
Yes, it's quite common.

41:52.433 --> 41:56.028
I thought it might be some rare,
exotic species.

41:56.417 --> 42:00.153
No. The police haven't connected
the poison to anyone?

42:00.230 --> 42:02.752
They're focused on Bernie and Ray.

42:03.136 --> 42:05.769
We have one man on the run,
another man murdered.

42:06.072 --> 42:08.238
Evidently, they argued,
and do you know what?

42:08.299 --> 42:11.262
I can't see how Flanagan
could have tainted the gloves

42:11.310 --> 42:12.576
if he wasn't there.

42:12.698 --> 42:17.198
So, did this Flanagan and Mickey
have any contact after the weigh-in?

42:17.447 --> 42:22.153
Mickey had a fight. Now, who, where?

42:22.503 --> 42:25.912
The only clue we have is some
gypsum on his clothes.

42:26.339 --> 42:27.672
Gypsum?
Now, I've checked.

42:27.761 --> 42:29.713
There are no gypsum mines close by.

42:29.790 --> 42:31.362
Farmers use it, of course,

42:31.410 --> 42:33.542
but short of checking every farm
in the district...

42:33.725 --> 42:35.734
Have you checked
McRae's Fertilisers?

42:49.109 --> 42:51.227
Been a while since this place
was up and running, Doc.

42:51.274 --> 42:53.366
Indeed.

43:06.009 --> 43:08.159
Charlie, Bill...

43:09.029 --> 43:10.859
..take a look at this.

43:11.922 --> 43:16.667
Someone's driven right up
to this point, only recently I'd say.

43:16.933 --> 43:18.542
Why would you want to steal gypsum?

43:18.631 --> 43:20.421
That's a good question, Bill.

43:22.909 --> 43:24.460
Why indeed?

43:25.255 --> 43:28.519
I don't think they took something.

43:30.288 --> 43:32.279
I think they left something.

43:36.218 --> 43:38.127
Oh, bloody hell.

43:40.141 --> 43:41.691
Mr Flanagan.

43:53.206 --> 43:55.208
Bruising on the abdomen and chest.

43:55.309 --> 43:57.032
I suspect we'll find broken ribs.

43:57.080 --> 44:01.202
There's possible internal bleeding.
He may have a ruptured spleen.

44:01.323 --> 44:04.047
The jaw is broken.
Possible skull fractures.

44:04.178 --> 44:06.469
What an awful way to die.

44:12.031 --> 44:13.695
Goodness me.

44:14.903 --> 44:17.284
Mickey beat Sean Flanagan to death.

44:17.790 --> 44:23.251
We know he was erratic,
but this, this was frenzied, cruel.

44:23.724 --> 44:25.393
He was a killer.

44:26.618 --> 44:31.829
If Mickey killed Flanagan,
who would want to take revenge?

44:32.063 --> 44:33.890
Still points to Bernie and Ray.

44:33.961 --> 44:37.586
Mind you, we're not sure
they knew Flanagan was dead.

44:37.634 --> 44:39.837
We're not sure they didn't,
and they had motive.

44:39.954 --> 44:42.102
True, but the others did too.

44:42.347 --> 44:45.782
Tracey Corelli, Lou.
And all of them were near the ring.

44:47.240 --> 44:48.702
The fight starts in two hours,

44:48.750 --> 44:51.081
our best shot before
they all disappear.

44:52.274 --> 44:57.860
Alright.
Who knew Mickey killed Sean Flanagan?

44:58.602 --> 45:01.774
Well, Mickey knew
but he didn't poison himself.

45:01.867 --> 45:04.452
No, but it could be the key.

45:04.782 --> 45:07.313
If a man does something so wrong,

45:07.439 --> 45:11.605
so terrible, who does he tell?

45:12.430 --> 45:14.579
Who would you tell?

45:34.414 --> 45:35.417
Bugger off!

45:35.465 --> 45:38.415
Miss Corelli, I'm Dr Lucien Blake,
police surgeon.

45:38.697 --> 45:42.461
The police have already been here,
along with everyone else.

45:42.509 --> 45:45.836
- Yes, I know.
- Poking around. I'm sick of it.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.878
Of course.
You've had a dreadful time.

45:49.167 --> 45:52.979
I suspect even
before Mickey died, yes?

45:56.829 --> 46:00.584
I stopped being sad.
I stopped crying.

46:03.482 --> 46:05.192
I'm back to being angry now.

46:05.396 --> 46:07.061
Thank you.

46:07.260 --> 46:09.630
But not because Mickey
was having an affair.

46:10.551 --> 46:12.434
I was relieved, really.

46:12.550 --> 46:15.919
I thought she might want
to take him off my hands.

46:16.133 --> 46:21.425
But Mickey wanted
to have his cake and eat it.

46:23.873 --> 46:25.473
I see.

46:25.943 --> 46:30.723
Miss Corelli, Tracey,
we know he was a violent man.

46:30.808 --> 46:34.500
It must have been very difficult.

46:35.160 --> 46:41.950
By the end, I hated him,
but I didn't do anything.

46:47.343 --> 46:48.853
Tell me...

46:50.177 --> 46:52.593
..did something happen
before the fight?

46:52.670 --> 46:54.677
Did Mickey confide in you
about something?

46:54.725 --> 46:56.349
Something he'd done? Something...

46:56.447 --> 46:59.669
Why does everyone think that
I saw Mickey then?

46:59.928 --> 47:02.661
The police, Gus, Lou.

47:03.439 --> 47:05.122
Everyone.
Gus and Lou?

47:05.219 --> 47:07.440
They both came in here,
looking for him.

47:07.547 --> 47:09.172
He even stood in the garden,

47:09.313 --> 47:11.414
looked in the window,
trying to find him.

47:11.545 --> 47:13.130
He?

47:36.685 --> 47:39.607
Listen, son, the only one
who can make this decision is you.

47:39.713 --> 47:43.316
I'm not pushing anything.
I just know you can do it, hmm?

47:43.441 --> 47:44.973
What's going on?

47:46.537 --> 47:49.185
I've told him if he's not ready,
we'll have to call it off,

47:49.321 --> 47:51.173
but we do have a plan.

47:52.634 --> 47:55.423
I'll give you boys a minute,
alright?

47:59.449 --> 48:00.920
You alright?

48:05.618 --> 48:07.088
Look...

48:08.189 --> 48:10.100
..I've got to tell you something.

48:12.550 --> 48:15.579
You're dropping your shoulder
too early on your cross.

48:17.189 --> 48:18.904
And how would you know that?

48:19.056 --> 48:22.829
Dad did the same.
Never stopped going on about it.

48:28.646 --> 48:31.435
Here, let me.

48:32.060 --> 48:34.161
If you want to box...

48:39.354 --> 48:41.543
..I'll be there for you, mate.

48:44.607 --> 48:46.238
Whatever happens.

49:01.949 --> 49:04.139
Watch the body, Ray. Watch the body.

49:35.386 --> 49:36.729
Bill.

50:09.027 --> 50:10.629
Fight.

50:14.629 --> 50:16.380
That's it. That's it.

50:20.894 --> 50:22.524
Your guard!

50:33.735 --> 50:35.564
Yeah, watch your bodyweight.

50:46.949 --> 50:51.460
Two, three, four, five!

51:06.550 --> 51:07.752
Yes?

51:08.017 --> 51:13.263
Gus, the officials asked me to, uh,
give your man a quick check-up.

51:13.344 --> 51:15.802
Yeah, yes. Of course, Doctor.

51:15.931 --> 51:19.739
What a fight, eh?
You never can predict it.

51:19.997 --> 51:23.270
Alright, Mr Connolly,
would you just look up for me?

51:23.357 --> 51:25.662
And back down.

51:25.904 --> 51:27.208
Amazing, isn't it?

51:27.309 --> 51:29.598
I mean, one would think
the King here,

51:29.708 --> 51:33.348
being heavier and taller, would win,
but no, it went the other way.

51:33.670 --> 51:36.880
Just side to side for me.
That's the beauty of boxing, Doctor.

51:36.947 --> 51:38.413
Oh, indeed.

51:38.584 --> 51:41.614
Things are never quite
what they appear to be.

51:41.723 --> 51:43.909
Like the way Mickey was poisoned.

51:44.079 --> 51:46.638
Mr Connolly, if you just
follow my finger,

51:46.686 --> 51:48.453
just with your eyes, yes?

51:50.550 --> 51:52.223
Good.

51:52.509 --> 51:53.981
Ah, Lou.

51:54.085 --> 51:56.911
Glad you could be here.
Why am I here?

51:57.028 --> 52:00.763
Well, I was just explaining to Gus
how Mickey was poisoned.

52:00.811 --> 52:01.942
Good man.

52:01.990 --> 52:05.491
You see, we only found poison
on Ray's boxing gloves,

52:05.555 --> 52:09.758
so of course I assumed
it went from glove to cut.

52:10.730 --> 52:13.098
But in fact it went
the other way.

52:13.327 --> 52:16.278
The poison was in the Vaseline.

52:16.479 --> 52:18.299
He put the Vaseline on Mickey.

52:18.447 --> 52:20.232
Yes. Yes, he did.

52:20.513 --> 52:22.531
Considerate of him
not to make you do it, Lou.

52:22.608 --> 52:24.583
That's crazy.

52:24.943 --> 52:29.169
But you gave me the jar
you said you used on Mickey.

52:29.352 --> 52:31.169
No blood, no mess.

52:31.503 --> 52:33.302
Doesn't look like
it was used in a fight.

52:33.350 --> 52:35.722
I think you substituted this one...

52:39.309 --> 52:41.223
..for the poisoned jar.

52:41.590 --> 52:45.138
This is ridiculous.
Why would I kill Mickey?

52:46.654 --> 52:48.524
Why indeed?

52:49.949 --> 52:51.393
Because you knew.

52:51.470 --> 52:53.593
You knew he killed Sean Flanagan.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.651
He asked you to help him
dispose of the body

52:55.728 --> 52:57.537
at the old fertiliser depot.

52:57.989 --> 53:00.748
I've never been to such a place.
But you have.

53:00.833 --> 53:03.618
Your overcoat had gypsum on it.

53:03.829 --> 53:06.248
- You murdered him!
- Charlie, take him outside.

53:07.798 --> 53:10.280
I saw it around the pocket
after the fight that night.

53:10.334 --> 53:12.748
And it's tricky - very tricky -

53:12.863 --> 53:15.490
trying to remove
all traces of powder.

53:15.584 --> 53:18.155
It gets into places
you just might not check.

53:18.283 --> 53:21.068
Tests will prove
that's gypsum and blood.

53:21.208 --> 53:23.865
You and Mickey went to the depot
to bury the body,

53:23.913 --> 53:28.075
You got gypsum on your clothes,
then you went to Flanagan's room.

53:28.123 --> 53:29.639
We found gypsum on the floor,

53:29.701 --> 53:31.686
and I'm guessing you took
his suitcase and his van

53:31.734 --> 53:33.177
to make it look like he'd run off.

53:33.225 --> 53:36.592
You were fixing Mickey's mess,
just like you'd always done,

53:36.688 --> 53:39.952
only this time,
this time you'd gone too far.

53:40.029 --> 53:42.593
Now you were an accessory to murder

53:42.670 --> 53:44.569
and he was never going
to let you forget it.

53:44.648 --> 53:46.825
He'd drag you down,
you'd lose everything.

53:46.873 --> 53:52.420
So, early the next morning,
you drove the van to Tracey's.

53:52.608 --> 53:53.998
I saw you.

53:54.074 --> 53:55.670
I was looking for Mickey.

53:55.767 --> 53:58.725
I saw you in the garden,
picking flowers.

53:58.952 --> 54:02.209
What? She's crazy.
What flowers?

54:02.288 --> 54:04.112
Wolfsbane.

54:04.483 --> 54:09.193
I suspect you recognised it
from the old family farm,

54:09.270 --> 54:13.772
from when you used to extract poison
and lay baits for the wolves.

54:13.942 --> 54:18.155
After all,
you had to protect the flock.

54:20.029 --> 54:21.579
Mickey was a mad dog.

54:25.441 --> 54:27.871
A mad dog, you put down.

54:31.949 --> 54:34.206
In the bags from the tip,
just like you thought.

54:34.259 --> 54:35.592
Well done, Bill.

54:46.016 --> 54:47.329
How're you holding up?

54:47.377 --> 54:49.125
It's going to get very, very tedious

54:49.173 --> 54:51.860
if you keep asking me that
the whole time I'm here.

54:53.349 --> 54:55.422
And how long might that be?

54:58.558 --> 55:00.797
As long as it takes, it seems.

55:02.255 --> 55:04.758
The higher-ups are sick of all
the musical chairs here,

55:04.806 --> 55:06.928
and I offer stability, apparently.

55:07.127 --> 55:08.954
Stability.

55:09.625 --> 55:11.339
How ironic.

55:13.604 --> 55:15.157
Frank really
messed things up here.

55:15.602 --> 55:17.153
But the debts he had here
were nothing

55:17.230 --> 55:18.910
compared to what
he racked up in Melbourne.

55:19.110 --> 55:24.193
Well, I'll tell you this.
We're very glad to have you back.

55:24.766 --> 55:27.872
Well, it'll give me a chance
to train up someone new in the ranks

55:28.016 --> 55:29.563
to take over when I've had enough.

55:29.623 --> 55:31.488
Who's the lucky man?

55:31.870 --> 55:34.300
Well, Bill's an obvious contender.

55:35.415 --> 55:36.995
Uh, sorry to intrude.

55:37.127 --> 55:39.813
We've re-bagged all the rubbish
from the tip, boss.

55:39.999 --> 55:41.461
Will we need anything else?

55:41.555 --> 55:43.220
No, I don't think so.

55:43.509 --> 55:44.752
Good job, Davis.

55:44.829 --> 55:46.739
You've done yourself proud
this week.

55:48.294 --> 55:51.915
Which is why, as of now,
you are Acting Senior Sergeant.

55:52.321 --> 55:53.979
Congratulations.

55:56.791 --> 55:58.413
I don't know what to say.

55:58.922 --> 56:01.531
Well, you can say goodnight.
Head home.

56:01.865 --> 56:03.277
Yes, sir.

56:09.523 --> 56:12.047
We live in interesting times,
Lucien.

56:14.688 --> 56:19.266
We do indeed.
Here's to you, you old bugger.

56:42.727 --> 56:45.020
Dad would have wanted you
to have that.

57:00.973 --> 57:02.711
Matthew...

57:05.312 --> 57:08.844
..Jean and I have some news.

57:09.078 --> 57:10.948
It's about bloody time.

57:11.985 --> 57:14.205
Thought you'd never get round
to asking her.

57:14.680 --> 57:17.977
I'll, uh, try and get my stuff
together and I'll buy you a drink.
