00:09.033 --> 00:10.367
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

00:10.467 --> 00:13.867
Incoming transmission from
Super President Kickbutt.

00:13.967 --> 00:16.067
- Hello, Max.
I'm calling for Phoebe.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.767
- Oh, sorry, wrong number.

00:18.867 --> 00:20.233
- Oh!

00:20.333 --> 00:21.967
- Madam President,
how can I help you?

00:22.067 --> 00:23.333
- The Hero League has decided

00:23.433 --> 00:26.433
it's time to take your
next big superhero step.

00:26.533 --> 00:29.433
- Oh, does it involve
moving away?

00:29.533 --> 00:33.233
- Anyway, you've been accepted
into our mentor program.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.100
I'm sending over a list
of approved superheroes

00:36.200 --> 00:37.400
who can take you
under their wing

00:37.500 --> 00:39.733
and teach you
everything they know.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.800
Choose one and report back.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.633
President Kickbutt out.

00:46.067 --> 00:49.233
- I can't believe
this is happening!

00:49.333 --> 00:51.667
I get to go to Metroburg
to train with a legend.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.433
Look who's on
the mentor list!

00:55.533 --> 00:58.233
- ALL: Tech Rider!

00:58.333 --> 01:00.300
- Oh, he has so many
awesome gadgets

01:00.400 --> 01:02.333
and look how many
saves he's racked up.

01:02.433 --> 01:04.133
- Forget about the saves.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.200
He's got a supercycle
that's so fast

01:06.300 --> 01:08.200
it'll turn your face
inside out.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.633
I must know how that feels.

01:10.733 --> 01:12.133
- Me, too.

01:12.233 --> 01:14.900
- So, Phoebe...

01:15.067 --> 01:16.833
it's pretty clear
who you're gonna choose.

01:16.933 --> 01:18.900
The guy's a superstar.

01:19.067 --> 01:20.733
Monitor,
call President Kickbutt.

01:20.833 --> 01:23.967
- COMPUTER VOICE: Please hold
for Super President Kickbutt.

01:25.833 --> 01:27.900
I've been accepted into
the Hero League Mentor Program.

01:28.067 --> 01:30.067
- Oh, honey,
that's fantastic!

01:31.333 --> 01:33.433
You know who's on that list.

01:33.533 --> 01:35.400
- Yeah, I do.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.300
- This is a dream come true.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.100
I finally get to mentor
my own daughter!

01:43.600 --> 01:46.067
- Oh, keep it
together, Hank.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.667
This is just the best
day of your life.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.200
- That was quick.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.100
Have you made your
decision already?

01:52.200 --> 01:54.567
- HANK: Ohhhh...

01:54.667 --> 01:57.700
- Yep, I'm choosing...

01:57.800 --> 01:59.100
Thunderman.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.900
- MAX & COLOSSO:
Thunderman?

02:01.067 --> 02:04.067
- Ohhhh...I'm so happy!

02:04.167 --> 02:07.067
Here come the supertears!

02:07.133 --> 02:10.067
Oh, you all are
crying, too?

02:10.133 --> 02:11.800
- MAX: Yeah.
- COLOSSO: Yeah.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.867
- PHOEBE: We're just so happy.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.100
- *

02:17.200 --> 02:18.367
* What you see

02:18.467 --> 02:20.067
* Is not what you get

02:20.167 --> 02:23.167
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:23.267 --> 02:24.900
* We fit right in

02:25.067 --> 02:26.367
* Bet you never guessed

02:26.467 --> 02:27.900
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:28.067 --> 02:29.467
* Just like all the rest

02:29.567 --> 02:31.267
* A picture
perfect family *

02:31.367 --> 02:33.367
* Is what we try to be

02:33.467 --> 02:34.733
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:34.833 --> 02:36.367
* The crazy things we do

02:36.467 --> 02:38.067
* This isn't
make believe *

02:38.133 --> 02:39.800
* It's our reality

02:39.900 --> 02:41.233
* Just your average family

02:41.333 --> 02:44.300
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:44.400 --> 02:48.167
* Livin' a double life *

02:50.800 --> 02:53.267
How exciting is this?

02:53.367 --> 02:55.900
Thunderman's gonna
be a mentor!

02:57.467 --> 02:59.800
One day, you will be
able to do this...

03:02.500 --> 03:03.800
- I can't believe
you picked Dad.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.600
- Not pick Dad!

03:06.700 --> 03:09.533
- Well, obviously
you won't fly,

03:09.633 --> 03:12.067
But, uh, you will
learn a lot.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.767
- Just not about supercycles.

03:14.867 --> 03:17.333
- To think--you could
have been stuck with someone

03:17.433 --> 03:22.800
like Technical Rider Man.
- It's just Tech Rider.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.700
- His supercycle and
all his high-tech gizmos

03:25.800 --> 03:27.433
might look cool,

03:27.533 --> 03:30.233
but they are no
substitute for this.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.400
- No, a brain.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.067
Whether you use supergadgets
or superpowers,

03:36.167 --> 03:38.367
it's a superhero's
best friend.

03:38.467 --> 03:40.633
- He does have a pretty
amazing save record, Dad.

03:40.733 --> 03:43.167
Oh, and he's a swimsuit
model, too.

03:43.267 --> 03:45.867
- Yeah, I've
modelled before.

03:49.433 --> 03:53.267
- Phoebe, we are gonna
do great things together.

03:53.367 --> 03:57.300
And, Max, my hair used
to look just like yours.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.600
Think about that.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.067
Maybe training with
Dad will be great.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.167
Thunderman is the greatest
superhero ever.

04:07.267 --> 04:09.200
- Was the greatest
superhero ever.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.567
- Tech Rider's the man now.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.633
And I know you feel
the same way because...

04:12.733 --> 04:16.833
you're writing "Phoebe hearts
Tech Rider" on your tablet.

04:16.933 --> 04:19.067
- Don't you have
a bunny to "heart"?

04:20.933 --> 04:22.667
- If she won't
change her mentor,

04:22.767 --> 04:25.167
then you're gonna
have to do it for her.

04:25.267 --> 04:27.567
- How am I supposed
to do that?

04:30.833 --> 04:33.367
So, like, if it's okay,

04:33.467 --> 04:36.533
I'd like to switch
my mentor to Tech Rider.

04:36.633 --> 04:38.733
Cool beans. OMG,
look at my nails.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.967
- Max, I have a job to do--

04:43.067 --> 04:46.567
and you are not pullin'
off that wig, girlfriend.

04:49.267 --> 04:50.400
- If I'm gonna get
that supercycle,

04:50.500 --> 04:51.800
I'm just gonna have
to convince Phoebe

04:51.900 --> 04:54.067
to ask for
Tech Rider herself.

04:56.067 --> 04:58.067
Why are you dressed
like a girl, too?

04:58.167 --> 05:00.100
- Uh, it's 4:30.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.300
- BARB: It's gonna be
cold today, guys,

05:06.400 --> 05:07.533
so, don't forget
your jackets.

05:07.633 --> 05:11.500
- I lost mine.
- CHLOE: Uh-oh!

05:11.600 --> 05:13.833
- Billy, that jacket
was brand new.

05:13.933 --> 05:17.267
Nora, I need your lunchbox.
- I lost it.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.933
- Here comes the hammer.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.800
- Okay, you guys can't
keep losing things.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.233
Jackets and lunchboxes
don't just grow on trees.

05:24.333 --> 05:25.733
- True. True.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.667
So, when you go
to the store,

05:27.767 --> 05:29.667
can you buy me a lunchbox
with a kitty on it?

05:29.767 --> 05:32.367
- No, I am not buying
you a new lunchbox.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.133
- Ha! Ha!

05:34.233 --> 05:36.100
- Or you a new jacket.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.667
- Ha! Ha!

05:37.767 --> 05:39.667
- Okay, you guys are just gonna
have to survive without them

05:39.767 --> 05:42.067
and then, maybe,
you'll learn not to lose stuff.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.100
- Don't even think
about it.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.800
- *

05:52.900 --> 05:56.600
- Oh, welcome to the mean
streets of Metroburg.

05:56.700 --> 05:57.833
- Very funny, Dad.

05:57.933 --> 06:01.933
To the real
Metroburg, away!

06:02.067 --> 06:04.233
Away!

06:04.333 --> 06:07.833
- Sweetie, this driveway
is our big city simulator.

06:07.933 --> 06:09.433
It's all about preparation.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.067
Now as a crime-fighter,
you have to learn

06:11.167 --> 06:13.167
how to arrive at a scene,
access a situation...

06:13.267 --> 06:15.933
...make the right call.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.633
- Okay.

06:17.733 --> 06:20.067
I'm here, this situation
is ridiculous,

06:20.133 --> 06:21.133
I'm going back inside.

06:21.233 --> 06:23.533
- No, no, Phoebe,
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe...

06:23.633 --> 06:25.100
this is serious,
all right?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.933
Now this bike represents
a tanker truck

06:27.067 --> 06:28.933
that crashed next to
a bus full of kids,

06:29.067 --> 06:31.700
stalled in a busy
intersection.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.633
- What's the empty
pizza box represent?

06:33.733 --> 06:36.633
- Oh, your Mom
made meatloaf.

06:37.567 --> 06:40.800
So...what do you do?

06:40.900 --> 06:43.200
- Um, I use my freeze breath

06:43.300 --> 06:45.367
on the tanker truck
so it doesn't explode,

06:45.467 --> 06:47.433
and everyone lives
happily ever after.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.700
- Almost.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.100
You forgot to
shut down the road.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.800
Look, here comes
an out-of-control cement truck.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.067
- I'm outta control, baby.

07:02.267 --> 07:05.400
- And you just caused
a 12-car pile-up.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.267
- You just got schooled.

07:10.967 --> 07:13.133
- Dad, I'm the protector
of Hiddenville.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.533
I think I'm past
pretend cement trucks

07:14.633 --> 07:16.667
and trash-talking toddlers.

07:16.767 --> 07:20.600
- Uh-uh-uh-uh!
Mentor. Mentee.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.400
Now, what's next?

07:22.500 --> 07:24.667
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Small town tornado.

07:24.767 --> 07:26.700
Okay, I was gonna get
some fans and, ooh,

07:26.800 --> 07:29.667
milk cartons to
represent flying cows!

07:31.733 --> 07:33.133
- Poor, poor Phoebe.

07:33.233 --> 07:35.367
Dad's never gonna
take you to Metroburg.

07:35.467 --> 07:36.933
- You don't know that.

07:37.067 --> 07:40.300
- I stole his training schedule.
- You do know that.

07:42.267 --> 07:43.433
What?

07:43.533 --> 07:45.367
After two weeks
in the driveway,

07:45.467 --> 07:47.467
I graduate to the attic?

07:47.567 --> 07:48.867
The only crime up
there is humidity.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.300
My hair's gonna
be a mess.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.767
- Oh, would you
look at that!

07:55.867 --> 07:59.300
Tech Rider just took
down some bank robbers.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.400
But don't you worry.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.467
Battling frizzy hair in
the attic sounds a lot more fun.

08:12.667 --> 08:16.133
- Uh, Phoebe Thunderman
for President Kickbutt, please.

08:16.233 --> 08:21.900
- *

08:23.067 --> 08:25.633
- I don't understand fashion.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.333
- Mom's making us
use this stuff now

08:27.433 --> 08:30.500
because Billy lost his jacket
and I lost my lunchbox.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.467
- You kids are just
like your Mom.

08:32.567 --> 08:34.467
She lost her phone
this morning.

08:34.567 --> 08:35.833
Now between you and me,

08:35.933 --> 08:39.767
the woman would lose her head,
if it wasn't screwed on.

08:39.867 --> 08:43.133
Hey, honey, your head
looks beautiful.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.833
- Aw, look at
my little garbage kids.

08:47.933 --> 08:50.567
Here, I need a picture.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.800
- Send me a copy.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.833
- Oh, my gosh,
how could she?

08:57.933 --> 09:00.100
- Well, she could
email it, text it.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.733
It's actually
kind of easy.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.267
- Not the picture.

09:04.367 --> 09:05.767
She has a new phone.

09:05.867 --> 09:08.267
She already replaced
the one she lost.

09:08.367 --> 09:09.800
- Well, that's not fair.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.800
She won't replace
the stuff we lost.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.400
- We need to teach
her a lesson.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.633
- And then we'll teach
you how to email and text.

09:16.733 --> 09:20.633
- *

09:20.733 --> 09:22.133
- Oh, there you are.

09:22.233 --> 09:23.867
Okay, Phoebe,
Mr. Sprinkles over there

09:23.967 --> 09:25.300
is biting through
the gas line.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.067
You're only gonna
have seconds before--

09:27.167 --> 09:30.733
- Uh, Dad, um...
I have to tell you something.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.100
I spoke to
President Kickbutt yesterday.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.367
We actually came up with a way
to make my mentorship better.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.433
- Well, what could be
any better than this?

09:50.400 --> 09:54.600
- I heard somebody
needs a new mentor.

09:56.233 --> 09:58.333
- That's how it
gets better.

10:01.933 --> 10:03.933
- So, you called
President Kickbutt

10:04.033 --> 10:07.333
and had me replaced with
this pimply

10:07.433 --> 10:09.567
- Dad, he has perfect skin.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.933
- Let me see
what I wanna see.

10:12.033 --> 10:14.000
- The Hero League said
this mentorship program

10:14.100 --> 10:16.133
is supposed to be for
on-the-job training,

10:16.233 --> 10:18.467
not on-the-driveway
training.

10:18.567 --> 10:21.000
- So, you think you're ready
to zip off to Metroburg

10:21.100 --> 10:23.000
on this--
- Supercycle!

10:25.300 --> 10:28.800
- Sorry, buddy, no one goes
near the supercycle.

10:30.767 --> 10:32.267
- It's okay.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.500
Seeing it from the ground,
with a slight head wound,

10:34.600 --> 10:36.767
is just as rewarding.

10:36.867 --> 10:40.867
- Thunderman!
It is an honor to meet you.

10:40.967 --> 10:42.200
I was actually lucky enough

10:42.300 --> 10:45.267
to be at your retirement
celebration in Metroburg.

10:45.367 --> 10:47.767
- See, Dad, he's not so bad.
He's a fan.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.567
- Yeah, my folks
said I slept through

10:49.667 --> 10:50.867
the whole thing
in my stroller,

10:50.967 --> 10:53.333
but, hey, I was
there, right?

10:53.433 --> 10:54.867
May I?

10:54.967 --> 10:58.633
- Drone selfie!

10:58.733 --> 11:01.933
- So, the Hero League tells me
you've cost them a fortune

11:02.067 --> 11:05.267
mopping up the aftermath
of your reckless behavior.

11:05.367 --> 11:08.367
- Sometimes you've gotta destroy
a whole city to save it,

11:08.467 --> 11:10.767
you know what I'm sayin'?

11:10.867 --> 11:12.767
- No.

11:12.867 --> 11:14.267
You are a riot, T-man.

11:14.367 --> 11:16.733
I'm gonna have my people
send you some swag.

11:16.833 --> 11:18.767
Brenda, send my new buddy,

11:18.867 --> 11:20.267
Thunderman,
a Tech Rider hat.

11:20.367 --> 11:23.600
He's got some weird hair.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.233
- Listen, kid,
sorry you came

11:26.333 --> 11:28.533
all this way on
your little scooter,

11:28.633 --> 11:30.067
but after this little show,

11:30.133 --> 11:32.067
I'm sure my daughter's
changed her mind

11:32.133 --> 11:33.967
about all this
tech nonsense.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.367
- Ooh, what's a nano
stun grenade?

11:38.900 --> 11:41.900
- Aw, what a cute
little marble.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.933
- TECH RIDER:

11:47.067 --> 11:49.767
Stunned him!
Good one, rookie.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.133
Let's go rack up some
saves in Metroburg.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.567
- Bye, T-man.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.067
- I'm kinda blind
right now, but...

12:08.100 --> 12:10.533
can I feel the look
on your face?

12:10.633 --> 12:12.300
Oh. Oh, yeah.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.367
You're much more
stunned than I am.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.133
- Look, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

12:17.233 --> 12:19.633
This is all part
of the mentoring process.

12:19.733 --> 12:22.667
I'm mentoring her
by letting her go.

12:22.767 --> 12:24.133
- Do you really
believe that?

12:24.233 --> 12:26.333
- Let me believe
what I wanna believe!

12:28.267 --> 12:31.067
- I don't know if I'm smelling
exhaust or failure.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.433
- Oh, I didn't fail, my friend.

12:33.533 --> 12:36.200
While T-man and Jerk Rider
were taking a selfie,

12:36.300 --> 12:38.567
I snuck over to
the supercycle,

12:38.667 --> 12:40.067
and put a remote
control on it.

12:40.167 --> 12:41.767
Then on my way back,

12:41.867 --> 12:43.667
I did what every
supervillain does--

12:43.767 --> 12:45.667
I crop dusted them.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.233
Now I just wait
for the right moment

12:50.333 --> 12:52.067
to activate
my remote control

12:52.133 --> 12:55.567
and drive it back
to its new daddy--me.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.867
- I call first ride!

12:57.967 --> 12:59.267
- Where'd you buy
that outfit?

12:59.367 --> 13:01.733
- You don't buy something
like this, Max...

13:01.833 --> 13:03.500
...you earn it.

13:05.433 --> 13:08.233
- Mom's sunglasses,
her shoes, her purse.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.867
- She's gonna think
she lost all this stuff,

13:10.967 --> 13:12.767
and when she replaces
them, like her phone,

13:12.867 --> 13:14.600
we'll bust her.

13:14.700 --> 13:17.500
- BARB: Okay, Hank,
maybe I left it downstairs.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.633
- She's coming!
Quick, hide everything!

13:26.067 --> 13:28.433
- Did you lose
something, Mom?

13:28.533 --> 13:33.200
- Uh, no, I am just
looking for...

13:33.300 --> 13:35.533
hugs!

13:35.633 --> 13:37.300
Where...?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.267
- Hey, Mom, can I borrow
your sneakers?

13:39.367 --> 13:41.800
I'm doing a school report
on women's footwear.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.067
- Uh, yeah. Maybe later.
I just...

13:44.133 --> 13:45.700
I have to go run
some errands.

13:47.367 --> 13:50.067
- Uh, it's what all
the moms are doing now.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.167
So, put that in your
report, huh?

13:52.267 --> 13:53.700
Bye!

14:03.067 --> 14:05.633
- That was awesome!
Right, Phoebe?

14:05.733 --> 14:07.933
Phoebe?

14:10.133 --> 14:11.967
Next time you do
a wheelie,

14:12.067 --> 14:13.800
can I get a little
heads up?

14:13.900 --> 14:16.067
I'll hold on tighter.

14:16.167 --> 14:20.333
- Learning lessons!
Up top!

14:20.433 --> 14:23.700
- I'd high-five you,
but my hands are full of gravel.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.533
- I got you covered. Woo!

14:25.633 --> 14:27.067
All righty!

14:27.133 --> 14:29.067
Looks like it's
your lucky day, rookie.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.667
We have got a big
first mish.

14:31.767 --> 14:34.467
That's what I call "mission."
It saves time.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.600
- Hey, learnin'
from my ment.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.367
- Mentor.

14:38.467 --> 14:40.567
I was just saving time.
Never mind.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.067
- Okay! All right!

14:42.167 --> 14:43.967
According to the Hero League,

14:44.067 --> 14:46.067
we have got a prison
break goin' down.

14:46.100 --> 14:49.433
Let's do this! Woo!

14:49.533 --> 14:51.367
- Wait! Well,
shouldn't we have a plan?

14:51.467 --> 14:53.500
I guess he'll
tell me inside.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.133
- *

14:57.233 --> 14:58.500
- It looks like
they've stopped.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.533
Time to bring my new
supercycle home.

15:09.233 --> 15:12.100
- It's empty!

15:12.200 --> 15:14.567
Where am I gonna find 47
"AA" batteries?

15:14.667 --> 15:18.067
Colosso, how many batteries
does your tanning bed take?

15:18.133 --> 15:19.300
- Don't you dare!

15:19.400 --> 15:22.333
It's almost beach season.

15:22.433 --> 15:24.333
- MALE VOICE ANNOUNCING:
Warning!

15:24.433 --> 15:26.167
Escape attempt in progress.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.967
- All right, let's assess
the situation.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.500
- Assess this.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.400
I'm gonna hit that thing
with a sonic pulse!

15:33.500 --> 15:35.267
- Wait!

15:39.633 --> 15:40.733
- Yeah, I do.

15:40.833 --> 15:44.200
That's the sound of
me saving everyone's butt!

15:44.300 --> 15:46.833
- Not quite. This place
is made out of thundertanium.

15:46.933 --> 15:48.067
It's indestructible
but it also

15:48.167 --> 15:49.700
amplifies sonic
waves that--

15:53.067 --> 15:55.067
- That will happen.

15:55.133 --> 15:57.700
Oh!

15:57.800 --> 15:59.800
- PHOEBE: The doors!

16:03.333 --> 16:05.167
- All right.
Mentor pop quiz.

16:05.267 --> 16:07.833
Twelve extremely shady
prisoners staring you down.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.167
What do you do?

16:09.267 --> 16:11.767
By the way, this is
a time-sensitive quiz.

16:14.133 --> 16:16.267
- I do this!

16:22.467 --> 16:28.933
- *

16:29.067 --> 16:31.767
- Now that's
a 12-car pile-up.

16:33.533 --> 16:37.400
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!
I just mentored it up!

16:37.500 --> 16:41.067
Drone selfie!

16:41.133 --> 16:46.367
- *

16:50.133 --> 16:52.767
- Just a few things
I needed to pick up.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.733
- I'll bet you did.

16:54.833 --> 16:57.267
- Listen, there's something
I need to tell you two.

16:57.367 --> 17:00.133
- Oh, there's plenty
you need to tell us.

17:00.233 --> 17:03.633
Like slippers were all
the rage--last season.

17:03.733 --> 17:05.767
- We know what
you've been up to.

17:05.867 --> 17:07.500
So we stole a bunch
of your things,

17:07.600 --> 17:09.167
knowing you'd just
go buy new ones.

17:09.267 --> 17:12.633
- New ones--like these.

17:12.733 --> 17:17.600
Sunglasses, shoes,
a pocketbook, earrings.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.633
Another phone!

17:19.733 --> 17:23.367
- A lunchbox.
A jacket for a tiny person.

17:25.167 --> 17:26.967
- Well, if you'd
let me finish,

17:27.067 --> 17:28.933
you'd know that I,
too, lose things,

17:29.067 --> 17:30.933
and I realized it
wasn't right

17:31.067 --> 17:35.067
for me to replace my stuff,
and not yours as well.

17:35.167 --> 17:37.800
- Well...thank you
for clearing that up.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.400
And you can rest assured that
we won't hold it against you.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.100
Come on, Billy!

17:44.200 --> 17:45.600
You two stole a bunch
of my stuff

17:45.700 --> 17:47.967
and you tried
to trick me.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.733
Two weeks' dish duty.

17:49.833 --> 17:52.633
- Or you walk away
from this knowing

17:52.733 --> 17:56.233
you have two of everything
and we don't tell Dad.

17:56.333 --> 18:01.433
- You can't negotiate.
I am the mom.

18:01.533 --> 18:03.200
One week's dish duty

18:03.300 --> 18:04.967
and I get to keep
all the phones.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.067
- BILLY & NORA: Deal!

18:10.467 --> 18:12.467
- What just happened
in there?

18:12.567 --> 18:13.967
- I taught you how to go

18:14.067 --> 18:17.067
from zero to awesome in
2.8 seconds! Up top!

18:17.133 --> 18:18.667
- When we got here,

18:18.767 --> 18:20.633
there was one bad guy
trying to escape.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.267
And thanks to your
2.8 seconds,

18:22.367 --> 18:25.433
I had to step in
and capture 12.

18:25.533 --> 18:29.100
- I'm not gonna lie, rookie.
You were amazing in there--

18:29.200 --> 18:31.467
which means I'm
an incredible mentor.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.267
Now...

18:33.367 --> 18:35.333
hop on because
I feel like doing

18:35.433 --> 18:38.467
a victory wheelie
tech ride!

18:38.567 --> 18:41.667
- No, I'm going home.
This was a mistake.

18:41.767 --> 18:44.433
And you can hop on.
I'm in front now.

18:44.533 --> 18:46.400
- Whoa!

18:46.500 --> 18:48.467
- Did you turn this
thing on?

18:50.433 --> 18:53.067
- Whoooaaaa!

18:53.133 --> 18:56.700
- Hey, get back here!

18:56.800 --> 18:59.633
I will not go back
to being Tech Walker!

19:01.367 --> 19:04.533
Tech Walker shoes, activate.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.133
- There it is. The supercycle's
on its way home.

19:13.233 --> 19:15.167
Thanks for the new batteries.

19:15.267 --> 19:17.067
- Don't thank me.
Thank Chloe.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.967
You are a monster!

19:28.467 --> 19:29.933
- Oh, I wish I could've
seen Phoebe's face

19:30.067 --> 19:32.300
when this thing took
off with nobody on it.

19:36.433 --> 19:38.533
Supercycle, I command
you to turn left.

19:38.633 --> 19:42.067
- All right!

19:42.167 --> 19:45.233
- That's right,
come to papa.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.833
- Oh, that looks fun.
Let me try.

19:47.933 --> 19:51.233
- Wait, paws off my remote.
- Come on, share!

19:51.333 --> 19:55.067
- My face is turning
inside out!

19:55.133 --> 19:57.967
- Let go!
- No, you let go!

19:59.733 --> 20:01.700
- Oh, no, the supercycle!

20:01.800 --> 20:03.667
- MAX: I think it's heading
for that cliff!

20:03.767 --> 20:06.400
- I'm heading for that cliff!

20:06.500 --> 20:09.400
- My supercycle!

20:12.933 --> 20:21.500
- *

20:21.600 --> 20:24.133
Dad!

20:24.233 --> 20:25.367
Thank you!

20:27.833 --> 20:31.133
Wait. Where'd
you come from?

20:31.233 --> 20:33.333
- I've been keeping
an eye on you.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.467
Not because I don't
trust you,

20:35.567 --> 20:38.100
because I didn't
trust Tech Rider.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.233
- You were right.
He is reckless.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.867
I was just so caught up
in his supercycle

20:43.967 --> 20:48.600
and his supergadgets,
and his supersmooth skin.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.633
- I hate to admit it,
but his skin does glow.

20:51.733 --> 20:54.067
- Dad, I never should
have replaced you.

20:54.167 --> 20:55.767
I'm sorry.

20:55.867 --> 20:58.000
- I understand. My methods
can be old-fashioned.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.133
I used everything you
taught me at the prison

21:01.233 --> 21:03.467
and that's what
saved the day.

21:03.567 --> 21:05.667
I can't wait for
our next lesson.

21:05.767 --> 21:09.100
- Are you saying you want
me to be your mentor again?

21:09.200 --> 21:10.367
- I'm saying...

21:10.467 --> 21:12.300
today made me
realize a mentor

21:12.400 --> 21:15.267
is a person you look
up to and learn from

21:15.367 --> 21:18.700
and that person's
always been you.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.133
So, I'm gonna call
President Kickbutt

21:21.233 --> 21:24.567
and make it official--again.

21:24.667 --> 21:27.067
Nothing would make me prouder.

21:29.467 --> 21:31.133
- Perfect, Chloe.

21:31.233 --> 21:33.667
Now I think the supercycle
disappeared from my radar

21:33.767 --> 21:37.167
somewhere around--
- Speaking of being proud...

21:37.267 --> 21:40.600
- Oh! Hey, guys!

21:40.700 --> 21:43.433
Chloe and I,
we're just leaving.

21:43.533 --> 21:44.700
Quick, home, Chloe!

21:44.800 --> 21:47.433
- This is for stealing
my batteries!

21:50.233 --> 21:55.500
- Any chance you two saw a
runaway motorcycle around here?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.233
- Thunderman...

21:57.333 --> 21:59.333
- HANK & PHOEBE: ...away!

21:59.433 --> 22:01.867
- I guess I'm walkin'.

22:01.967 --> 22:04.533
- On your left!

22:10.967 --> 22:26.833
- *
