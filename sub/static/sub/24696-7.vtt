<i>In New York
city's war on crime,</i>

00:07.903 --> 00:10.971
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:10.972 --> 00:13.274
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:13.275 --> 00:15.243
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:21.870 --> 00:23.238
- So sorry, ladies.

00:23.239 --> 00:25.575
Sorry, ladies, I'm running late.
Catch me after the show.

00:25.576 --> 00:28.078
I'm all yours, I promise.
I'm late. I'm late.

00:30.214 --> 00:33.457
- You better hurry... Amanda
just gave the go-ahead to Brice.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.998
- Six months of previews
and not once with an understudy?

00:35.999 --> 00:37.203
I'm ten minutes late.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.989
- I know, but you know Amanda.
She panics.

00:40.459 --> 00:43.444
- Ethereal, spectacular.
Perfect!

00:43.445 --> 00:46.413
- Calm down, everybody.
I'm here. I'm here.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.048
- Well, so you are.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.050
- Sorry, buddy.
- No worries.

00:50.051 --> 00:53.924
- All right,
let's get Marc hooked up.

00:53.925 --> 00:55.959
- Sorry.
- All right...

00:55.960 --> 00:59.227
Now, remember, in the scene
where you defy daedalus,

00:59.228 --> 01:00.361
don't push.

01:00.362 --> 01:01.495
Just be.
- Yeah.

01:01.496 --> 01:04.797
I am.
I am icarus.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.166
- I'm talking
about hitting the note on-key,

01:07.167 --> 01:08.370
for once.
- I get it.

01:08.371 --> 01:10.706
Amanda, trust me.
- All right?

01:10.707 --> 01:13.176
- I got you the Cobb.
You haven't eaten all day.

01:13.177 --> 01:16.480
- I don't need a salad.
I need a drink.

01:16.481 --> 01:19.352
And get me Evan korman
on the phone!

01:19.353 --> 01:20.486
- Hello, Amanda.

01:20.487 --> 01:22.656
- Marc has to go.

01:22.657 --> 01:24.058
He's getting laughs in places

01:24.059 --> 01:25.727
where the audience
should be crying.

01:25.728 --> 01:30.066
It wasn't my idea to hire
a sitcom star.

01:30.067 --> 01:32.535
You said you needed a name.
- Yeah. You know why...

01:32.536 --> 01:36.105
because you ripped out 200 seats
to build your labyrinth.

01:36.106 --> 01:38.859
We lose 20 grand in ticket sales
every night.

01:40.795 --> 01:42.579
- Adam!
Jeez, you shouldn't have.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.180
I...
- Well, I didn't.

01:44.181 --> 01:46.583
They were outside your door.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.084
- Did you, uh, hear rehearsal?

01:48.085 --> 01:50.054
I think I nailed
that b-flat in <i>Labyrinth.</i>

01:50.055 --> 01:52.090
- Did you tell Amanda

01:52.091 --> 01:54.392
that you have a problem
with the minotaur number?

01:54.393 --> 01:58.430
- No.
I would never do that.

01:58.431 --> 02:00.766
- Well, she sends me an email

02:00.767 --> 02:04.037
saying the song
isn't <i>big</i> enough.

02:04.038 --> 02:06.874
- That's crazy.
You play 60,000-seat arenas.

02:06.875 --> 02:08.741
The song is brilliant.

02:08.743 --> 02:10.310
<i>- I'm getting</i>

02:10.311 --> 02:12.145
<i>high and higher</i>

02:12.146 --> 02:14.614
<i>I'm gonna touch the fire</i>

02:14.615 --> 02:15.715
- Stop!

02:17.051 --> 02:19.485
<i>- I'm gonna hold it in my hands</i>

02:19.486 --> 02:22.088
- The melody is still wrong.

02:22.089 --> 02:25.058
The audience needs to feel
dark, conflicted.

02:25.059 --> 02:26.994
- It's a Broadway musical,
Amanda.

02:26.995 --> 02:29.163
People want to feel happy.
- No, no, no, no.

02:29.164 --> 02:32.433
- The... the strings are...
they're too...

02:32.434 --> 02:34.302
They're too soaring.

02:34.303 --> 02:37.056
- He's flying, for God's sake.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.900
<i>I can't get any closer</i>

02:49.271 --> 02:52.491
<i>I'm falling back to earth</i>

02:52.492 --> 02:55.144
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

02:58.615 --> 03:00.049
- Aah!

03:01.319 --> 03:04.772
- Oh, my God.
Marc.

03:04.773 --> 03:06.357
- Bring in the curtain!

03:53.063 --> 03:54.663
Marc Landry, 30.

03:54.664 --> 03:56.364
Rigging snapped during a stunt.

03:56.365 --> 03:58.148
He fell 30 feet...
broken neck.

03:58.149 --> 04:00.850
Paramedics called it
in the ambulance.

04:00.851 --> 04:02.685
- And you called major case
instead

04:02.686 --> 04:05.121
of the occupational safety
and health administration.

04:05.122 --> 04:06.623
- Well, it wasn't
a workplace accident.

04:06.624 --> 04:08.024
The rigging was sabotaged.

04:08.025 --> 04:10.494
Our crime-scene unit determined
that a rope on the harness

04:10.495 --> 04:12.162
was deliberately cut.

04:12.163 --> 04:14.431
Stage manager discovered
the tampering and called us in.

04:14.432 --> 04:16.100
- You saw the actor fall?

04:16.101 --> 04:20.504
- We all did.
It was horrible.

04:20.505 --> 04:22.205
- Whoever did this

04:22.206 --> 04:24.641
tried to make it look
like the rope was frayed.

04:24.642 --> 04:27.144
Who was responsible
for the rigging?

04:27.145 --> 04:28.512
- Our aerial rigger,
Donald cogan.

04:28.513 --> 04:30.180
- He and his crew
did the safety check

04:30.181 --> 04:31.649
a half hour before performance.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.484
- Who had access to it
after that?

04:33.485 --> 04:36.454
- Anyone on the cast and crew...
about 45 people.

04:36.455 --> 04:39.824
- We need a list of names.

04:39.825 --> 04:41.859
- Well, it was subtle enough

04:41.860 --> 04:46.597
so he didn't notice
that the rope was cut.

04:49.734 --> 04:52.203
Who actually put
the actor in the rig

04:52.204 --> 04:53.704
right before he started?

04:53.705 --> 04:55.873
- We have our safety procedures
in check,

04:55.874 --> 04:57.875
but as of late, Marc insisted

04:57.876 --> 04:59.544
that he be responsible
for the final check.

04:59.545 --> 05:01.012
- Why would he want
final check?

05:01.013 --> 05:03.414
- Marc Landry
was a sitcom star.

05:03.415 --> 05:05.716
I guess he was used
to being the boss.

05:05.717 --> 05:08.253
- Were there resentments
towards him because of that,

05:08.254 --> 05:09.921
like from
the other actors or...?

05:09.922 --> 05:11.857
- Resentment,
envy, insecurity...

05:11.858 --> 05:14.726
they're practically
job requirements.

05:14.727 --> 05:17.896
- This rigging was secure
when I did my safety check.

05:17.897 --> 05:21.434
But anyone could have
gotten hold of a knife.

05:21.435 --> 05:24.404
- Did anyone on the crew
have a problem with Marc Landry?

05:24.405 --> 05:27.041
- All I know,
it wasn't me or my team.

05:27.042 --> 05:28.742
We wouldn't damage the wings.

05:28.743 --> 05:30.243
They took three months
to complete.

05:30.244 --> 05:33.246
- Wow. I mean, that... that seems
like a long time.

05:33.247 --> 05:34.713
- Amanda's a perfectionist.

05:34.714 --> 05:36.916
We all support
her vision, but...

05:36.917 --> 05:38.651
Safety is our
number-one priority.

05:38.652 --> 05:40.420
- Really?

05:40.421 --> 05:43.691
Because this production's been
plagued with safety issues.

05:43.692 --> 05:45.259
A stuntman fell off a platform.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.261
An actress's rigging snapped.

05:47.262 --> 05:48.763
It's been on the cover
of the <i>post.</i>

05:48.764 --> 05:50.932
- We had some kinks.
We worked 'em out.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.601
- Wow.
Four boys.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.538
You... I...
they look a lot like you.

05:55.539 --> 05:57.273
Where's your wife?

05:57.274 --> 05:58.641
- I'm divorced.

05:58.642 --> 06:00.310
- Oh...

06:00.311 --> 06:01.878
- Uh, detectives.

06:01.879 --> 06:03.280
Hi.
- Hi.

06:03.281 --> 06:05.783
- Hi. I'm Roger Porter.
- The director's assistant.

06:05.784 --> 06:09.053
- Actually, I'm...
I'm a dramaturge.

06:09.054 --> 06:11.956
- Sorry?
- Uh, a dramaturge.

06:11.957 --> 06:14.292
I help Amanda
shape her creative vision

06:14.293 --> 06:16.561
in all aspects
of the production.

06:16.562 --> 06:18.229
- Amanda's the director?

06:18.230 --> 06:20.732
- Yes. Anyway, she went
in the ambulance,

06:20.733 --> 06:23.302
but she's on her way back,
and she wanted me to tell you

06:23.303 --> 06:25.771
that she intends to cooperate
fully with the investigation.

06:25.772 --> 06:27.772
- How nice of her.

06:27.773 --> 06:29.440
- And if there's anything
I can do to help...

06:29.441 --> 06:30.441
- Well, yes, there is.

06:30.442 --> 06:31.809
Uh, where's the last place

06:31.810 --> 06:35.012
that Marc would have been
before his performance?

06:35.013 --> 06:37.414
- You know, Marc made up
in enthusiasm

06:37.415 --> 06:40.316
what he lacked
in natural ability.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.152
- How'd he get along
with the rest of the company?

06:42.153 --> 06:45.021
- I never saw any tension.

06:45.022 --> 06:46.321
- How about Amanda?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.123
We heard she's a perfectionist.

06:48.124 --> 06:49.425
- She's a genius.

06:49.426 --> 06:51.861
You know, sometimes strong women
get pegged as a bitch.

06:51.862 --> 06:54.964
- All the same, what was
her relationship with Marc?

06:54.965 --> 06:58.767
- Well, they had
their creative differences.

06:58.768 --> 07:01.103
But at the end of the day,
it was all about the work.

07:01.104 --> 07:02.771
It was nothing personal.

07:02.772 --> 07:04.206
- Romantic involvements?

07:04.207 --> 07:07.643
- He was a straight, single,
good-looking guy in the theater,

07:07.644 --> 07:09.578
so...Yeah.

07:09.579 --> 07:13.499
But I don't know
of anyone special.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.354
- Peacock feathers...

07:17.355 --> 07:19.689
Bad luck in the theater.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.624
Somebody might have been trying
to jinx him.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.360
There's no card.

07:23.361 --> 07:25.061
You have any idea
who sent this?

07:25.062 --> 07:26.863
- No.
- That's an unusual vase.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.699
Maybe we can track the florist.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.634
- Uh, Amanda's here.

07:30.635 --> 07:33.703
Um, I'll take you
to her office.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.807
- It was like a terrible,
terrible dream.

07:36.808 --> 07:40.277
I saw Marc's body jerk.

07:40.278 --> 07:41.479
It wasn't elegant.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.147
I knew...

07:43.148 --> 07:45.982
Instantly
that something was wrong.

07:45.983 --> 07:47.884
I just...

07:47.885 --> 07:52.388
the whole thing is...
it's... it's unimaginable.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.490
- So you and Marc were close.

07:54.491 --> 07:58.995
- We've been in rehearsals
and previews for over two years.

07:58.996 --> 08:00.062
We're a family.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.598
- Where were you
before the performance?

08:02.599 --> 08:04.433
- Ohh! Before a performance,
I'm obsessive.

08:04.434 --> 08:06.835
I was in props, wardrobe,
lighting,

08:06.836 --> 08:10.238
bitching out the caterer
for no anchovies on the pizza.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.140
- Greek mythology seems to be

08:12.141 --> 08:16.412
a reoccurring theme
in your work.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.882
Your three movies,
your last musical, <i>pandora.</i>

08:19.883 --> 08:22.185
- Yes, I'm drawn
to the classic stories...

08:22.186 --> 08:25.021
how human nature endures.
- Right.

08:25.022 --> 08:28.425
And the labyrinth...

08:28.426 --> 08:31.428
Well, it's part
of the icarus story.

08:31.429 --> 08:35.631
Daedalus... he builds
the labyrinth to imprison...

08:35.633 --> 08:37.067
- The minotaur.

08:37.068 --> 08:39.770
- Minotaur. Right.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.774
I like the way you...
well, your representation

08:42.775 --> 08:43.875
of it onstage.

08:43.876 --> 08:45.210
- Thank you.

08:45.211 --> 08:48.814
Yes, the... the labyrinth
represents

08:48.815 --> 08:50.816
a-a journey of discovery,

08:50.817 --> 08:54.386
a pilgrimage to the truth.

08:54.387 --> 08:57.205
- Our job in a nutshell.

08:59.341 --> 09:01.793
- This show is Broadway Teflon.

09:01.794 --> 09:04.363
Ticket sales have doubled
since the murder.

09:04.364 --> 09:07.266
- Never underestimate
the public's appetite for blood.

09:07.267 --> 09:09.334
- Well, who was out
for Marc Landry's?

09:09.335 --> 09:12.304
Any of the 45 people
with backstage access

09:12.305 --> 09:14.572
have a grudge?
- Not that they're admitting to.

09:14.573 --> 09:17.742
We're also looking at financials
and anyone with a sheet.

09:17.743 --> 09:20.945
- Well, make sure all 45 of them
are reinterviewed.

09:20.946 --> 09:23.847
Have them state where they were
between 6:30 and 9:30

09:23.848 --> 09:25.348
and who they were with.

09:25.349 --> 09:29.085
- Maybe someone took offense
at his tweets.

09:29.086 --> 09:30.754
Marc started a Twitter campaign

09:30.755 --> 09:33.524
after the actress playing
ariadne, Gwendolyn swift,

09:33.525 --> 09:34.758
broke her leg.

09:34.759 --> 09:36.960
It was the second
rigging accident

09:36.961 --> 09:38.462
in the last four months.

09:38.463 --> 09:41.665
In the first one,
a stuntman broke three ribs.

09:41.666 --> 09:44.567
"As actors, we must feel safe.

09:44.568 --> 09:46.837
"We're fighting for our lives

09:46.838 --> 09:50.106
"against the stupidity
of producers and directors.

09:50.107 --> 09:52.609
I will defend Gwendolyn
to the death."

09:52.610 --> 09:54.311
- Very gallant.

09:54.312 --> 09:58.782
Well, maybe somebody
challenged him to a duel.

09:58.783 --> 10:01.117
- It needs more light!

10:01.118 --> 10:02.952
The sun should be dazzling.

10:02.953 --> 10:06.655
- Adjust lighting
per designer's input.

10:06.656 --> 10:09.591
- Amanda, it's fantastic.

10:09.592 --> 10:11.326
But let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

10:11.327 --> 10:12.895
- Evan, what are you
doing here?

10:12.896 --> 10:15.531
- Roger said that you were
still working on the stage.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.533
- I wanted to make sure
we have clearance from osha.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.569
- It's perfectly safe.
- No, it's not.

10:20.570 --> 10:23.305
Marc's dead. Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

10:23.306 --> 10:26.208
- Yes.
He gave his life for this.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.243
That's why the cast and crew,
all of us,

10:28.244 --> 10:29.845
need to keep going.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.348
- Marc's memorial is tomorrow.
Let's focus on that for now.

10:32.349 --> 10:36.152
- My work needs to be my focus.

10:36.153 --> 10:39.555
Otherwise, what else
would I have?

10:39.556 --> 10:41.490
Brighter!

10:41.491 --> 10:43.041
Dazzle me!

10:44.711 --> 10:46.862
- You can see from the report,
the stuntman's fall,

10:46.863 --> 10:50.565
Gwendolyn's fall
were both ruled accidental.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.567
- First accident was caused
by a loose screw

10:52.568 --> 10:53.936
on the grappling hook...

10:53.937 --> 10:56.472
same thing again
for the second.

10:56.473 --> 10:58.674
- Exactly.
Both accidents.

10:58.675 --> 11:01.744
- Donald, you're a craftsman.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.581
You know, you're best
in your field.

11:04.582 --> 11:06.049
I mean...

11:06.050 --> 11:08.651
Maybe you missed
tightening a screw once,

11:08.652 --> 11:09.885
but not twice.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.588
- I made a mistake.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.224
I admitted it.

11:15.225 --> 11:17.827
- And how come
you were never fired?

11:17.828 --> 11:20.162
- You told us
you were getting divorced.

11:20.163 --> 11:22.932
But you didn't tell us
it was an ongoing divorce

11:22.933 --> 11:24.901
with a custody battle
for your children.

11:24.902 --> 11:26.602
She wants full custody.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.204
- Attorney fees
are astronomical.

11:28.205 --> 11:29.938
- Your financial records
indicate

11:29.939 --> 11:31.506
payments
to your divorce attorney

11:31.507 --> 11:33.175
far in excess of your salary.

11:33.176 --> 11:35.410
- Your love your boys,
don't you?

11:35.411 --> 11:37.613
You don't want her
to take them away from you.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.781
- Help yourself out here.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.267
Who paid you to tamper
with Gwendolyn's rig?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.626
- He wanted a...

11:51.627 --> 11:54.713
Spectacular screwup
that would make the papers.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.403
I thought I could do it.

12:00.404 --> 12:02.639
I didn't want
to hurt the girl...

12:02.640 --> 12:04.975
Nor the stuntman.
I...

12:04.976 --> 12:07.444
I thought I could make it look
like an accident, that's all.

12:07.445 --> 12:10.213
- Who wanted the screwup?

12:10.214 --> 12:12.081
- The producer...

12:12.082 --> 12:14.700
Evan korman.

12:16.669 --> 12:21.322
- Did he ever ask you
to sabotage Marc's rig?

12:21.323 --> 12:23.357
- No.

12:23.358 --> 12:25.826
But when Marc fell...

12:25.827 --> 12:27.794
I knew Evan was gonna cash in.

12:27.795 --> 12:30.497
- And they say
there's no creativity

12:30.498 --> 12:32.549
in the theater these days.

12:35.932 --> 12:37.732
His allegations are insane.

12:37.733 --> 12:40.019
I'd never sabotage
my own production.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.120
- We have a sworn affidavit

12:41.121 --> 12:43.889
from the aerial rigger,
Donald Cogan.

12:43.890 --> 12:46.859
He claims you paid him
$50,000 cash

12:46.860 --> 12:50.197
to stage an accident
that injured a stuntman

12:50.198 --> 12:52.433
and Gwendolyn swift.
- He's lying.

12:52.434 --> 12:54.001
- Why would he accuse you?

12:54.002 --> 12:55.903
- To cover his own ass.
I have no idea.

12:55.904 --> 12:57.571
This whole thing
is absolutely nuts.

12:57.572 --> 12:58.939
- Take it easy, Evan.

12:58.940 --> 13:02.210
Do you have any proof my client
made this alleged payment?

13:02.211 --> 13:04.178
- I'm sure he was careful
to cover his tracks.

13:04.179 --> 13:06.413
- There's no track covering,
because I didn't do anything.

13:06.414 --> 13:08.582
- Well, now you have
a potential <i>spider-man</i>

13:08.583 --> 13:09.917
on your hands here...

13:09.918 --> 13:11.685
you know, embarrassing
headlines, production delays,

13:11.686 --> 13:13.921
you know,
an industry joke, right?

13:13.922 --> 13:16.857
- And orchestrating a murder
is gonna help me? How?

13:16.858 --> 13:18.159
- Well...

13:18.160 --> 13:21.529
Maybe you didn't want
Marc Landry killed.

13:21.530 --> 13:25.032
Maybe you just wanted another
ticket-boosting broken leg

13:25.033 --> 13:26.934
or cracked rib or something...
I don't know.

13:26.935 --> 13:30.571
I mean, after
Gwendolyn's accident...

13:30.572 --> 13:32.573
You sold out
four months in advance.

13:32.574 --> 13:34.575
- I'm going to deliberately
injure an actor

13:34.576 --> 13:36.544
I was paying ten grand a week,

13:36.545 --> 13:39.947
an actor I had to fight Amanda
tooth and nail to cast?

13:39.948 --> 13:41.949
No way.

13:41.950 --> 13:45.587
- My client wasn't even
at the theater that night.

13:45.588 --> 13:49.525
- My father
was a Broadway producer...

13:49.526 --> 13:50.993
So was his father.

13:50.994 --> 13:52.696
It's a small industry.

13:52.697 --> 13:55.098
End of the day, all you have
is your reputation.

13:55.099 --> 13:57.100
And you could back up
the brink's truck.

13:57.101 --> 13:59.504
There's not enough money
in the world to make me

13:59.505 --> 14:01.105
shame the korman name.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.809
- D.A.'S charging Donald cogan
with felonious assault...

14:04.810 --> 14:06.977
not exactly a resume builder.

14:06.978 --> 14:08.679
- Well, the rigger's one thing,

14:08.680 --> 14:11.216
but a big Broadway producer
killing off his own actor

14:11.217 --> 14:14.185
just to boost ticket sales...
that's a little melodramatic.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.954
- We have the D.A.'S office

14:15.955 --> 14:18.255
looking into the play's
insurance agreements

14:18.256 --> 14:20.425
to find out if Marc's death
indemnifies korman

14:20.426 --> 14:22.826
against losses.
- But he didn't do it himself.

14:22.827 --> 14:24.628
The building security says
korman was in his office

14:24.629 --> 14:27.197
from 6:00 to 9:45
that night.

14:27.198 --> 14:28.965
- A search turn up anything?

14:28.966 --> 14:30.499
- Nothing to tie him
to Donald cogan.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.934
It's, uh,
he-said, he-said.

14:31.935 --> 14:34.970
- No evidence, thin motive,
headlines of <i>the New York times</i>

14:34.971 --> 14:38.406
pointing out the lack
of suspects in this case...

14:38.407 --> 14:39.975
I'm starting to hate
the theater.

14:39.976 --> 14:41.576
- We tracked down the florist
that delivered

14:41.577 --> 14:42.811
the peacock-feather bouquet.

14:42.812 --> 14:45.313
It was ordered by Brice calder.

14:45.314 --> 14:46.998
- That's Marc's understudy.

14:49.268 --> 14:51.520
- I sent Marc peacock feathers
as a joke.

14:51.521 --> 14:53.421
I'm sure he didn't get it.

14:53.422 --> 14:55.490
No disrespect...
the guy was a moron.

14:55.491 --> 14:58.360
- So you two weren't buddies?

14:58.361 --> 15:00.262
- You're asking if I had
anything to do

15:00.263 --> 15:01.730
with him getting killed?

15:01.731 --> 15:03.165
- Did you?

15:03.166 --> 15:05.134
You know, Marc out of the way,

15:05.135 --> 15:07.636
you put on the wings,
and you're icarus.

15:07.637 --> 15:10.640
- That's a little
<i>all about Eve-ish.</i>

15:10.641 --> 15:13.810
Don't you think?

15:13.811 --> 15:15.445
- Thank you.
You're telling me

15:15.446 --> 15:17.380
that you didn't resent him
at all?

15:17.381 --> 15:21.150
A tv actor
with no theater chops

15:21.151 --> 15:23.185
gets the role over you.

15:23.186 --> 15:25.787
I mean, you were nominated
for an obie.

15:25.788 --> 15:28.290
- You googled me.
I'm flattered.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.525
- Had to sting...
night after night,

15:30.526 --> 15:32.460
seeing a sitcom star
mangle the part.

15:32.461 --> 15:35.129
- That's how
the business works.

15:35.130 --> 15:36.964
They want a name.

15:36.965 --> 15:39.734
Yeah, well, I have a name.
It's Brice calder.

15:39.735 --> 15:42.470
- Detective goren.

15:42.471 --> 15:45.073
- Did you see Marc
the night he was killed?

15:45.074 --> 15:47.976
- Yeah, for, like, two seconds
at the stunt rehearsal.

15:47.977 --> 15:49.545
Marc shows up late.

15:49.546 --> 15:52.047
They took the harness off me,
put it on him.

15:52.048 --> 15:53.648
- He was late?
Did he say why?

15:53.649 --> 15:56.051
- I don't know. He was probably
banging some tourist

15:56.052 --> 15:57.318
in the limo.

15:57.319 --> 16:00.155
Anyway, he shows up, I split.

16:00.156 --> 16:02.757
I was in sardi's
the rest of the night.

16:02.758 --> 16:04.058
- I know Brice.

16:04.059 --> 16:07.095
He's got attitude for days,
but he tips great.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.565
- The night Marc Landry was
killed, Brice was at the bar?

16:09.566 --> 16:11.768
- Yeah, from, like,
6:30 to 9:30.

16:11.769 --> 16:13.269
We're usually pretty dead
around then,

16:13.270 --> 16:14.771
but that night,

16:14.772 --> 16:16.673
some of the audience
from the show came in,

16:16.674 --> 16:18.341
freaking out
about what happened.

16:18.342 --> 16:20.577
- Did Brice have
an attitude about Marc?

16:20.578 --> 16:22.079
- Yeah, he was bitching

16:22.080 --> 16:23.848
how he was supposed
to go on that night.

16:23.849 --> 16:25.383
A critic was showing up.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.719
That could have been Brice
in the rigging.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.488
Talk about dodging a bullet.

16:30.489 --> 16:34.325
- T-there was
a-a critic in the audience?

16:34.326 --> 16:36.627
I mean, isn't that
unusual for a preview?

16:36.628 --> 16:39.129
- Michael DeWitt
from <i>the times</i> was in here

16:39.130 --> 16:40.330
three nights ago,

16:40.331 --> 16:42.265
cozying up
with the director, Amanda.

16:42.266 --> 16:43.800
A waitress heard her tell him

16:43.801 --> 16:45.535
a big cast change
was in the works.

16:45.536 --> 16:46.736
- Brenda?

16:46.737 --> 16:48.471
- Will you guys excuse me
for one sec?

16:48.472 --> 16:50.774
Thanks.

16:50.775 --> 16:54.477
- Maybe Amanda wasn't so in love
with her actor after all.

16:54.478 --> 16:57.113
- Amanda and I are old friends.

16:57.114 --> 16:58.414
We were just having a drink.

16:58.415 --> 17:01.116
- We heard she confided in you
about cast changes.

17:01.117 --> 17:02.818
Did she mean Marc Landry?

17:02.819 --> 17:04.019
- That's confidential.

17:04.020 --> 17:07.288
- Look, every other actor
on <i>icarus</i>

17:07.289 --> 17:10.157
is a respected pro, right?

17:10.159 --> 17:12.425
Marc Landry was a...
he was a sitcom actor.

17:12.426 --> 17:14.127
You're not
giving anything away.

17:14.128 --> 17:15.561
- Okay.

17:15.563 --> 17:16.997
Off the record,

17:16.998 --> 17:19.665
Marc Landry was dreadful,
atrocious.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.135
Getting killed
was the best thing

17:21.136 --> 17:23.337
that ever happened
to his Broadway career.

17:23.338 --> 17:25.872
- Otherwise, he would have
been murdered by your review?

17:25.873 --> 17:27.473
- Out of respect for the dead,

17:27.474 --> 17:29.576
of course I'm not reviewing
that performance.

17:29.577 --> 17:31.411
- Yeah, but you went
to a preview.

17:31.412 --> 17:33.481
Isn't it customary to wait
until opening night?

17:33.482 --> 17:35.149
- Amanda said the show
was ready.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.151
I think she believed
she'd get a better review

17:37.152 --> 17:38.686
if Brice was in the lead.

17:38.687 --> 17:41.922
- But the cast
was the same that night.

17:41.923 --> 17:43.423
Marc was icarus.

17:43.424 --> 17:45.392
- I assume Amanda
was overruled.

17:45.393 --> 17:47.094
By who?

17:47.095 --> 17:48.629
The problem
with this production...

17:48.630 --> 17:50.797
too many egos in the kitchen.

17:50.798 --> 17:53.167
- The composer, Adam winter...

17:53.168 --> 17:54.501
he was a rock star,

17:54.502 --> 17:56.303
much bigger name than Amanda.

17:56.304 --> 17:58.005
- And despite the machismo,

17:58.006 --> 18:00.307
he's quite insecure
about transitioning

18:00.308 --> 18:04.178
from guitar hero to lyricist
on the great white way.

18:04.179 --> 18:05.779
I doubt she could make
a decision

18:05.780 --> 18:07.681
without his being on board.

18:07.682 --> 18:10.818
- I wondered
why that little prick

18:10.819 --> 18:12.853
was in the audience.

18:12.854 --> 18:15.189
- Amanda didn't tell you
she invited DeWitt?

18:15.190 --> 18:18.025
- No, but that... that's
typical Amanda behavior.

18:18.026 --> 18:19.493
She, uh...

18:19.494 --> 18:21.461
She does what she wants.

18:21.462 --> 18:23.530
- Well, uh, did...

18:23.531 --> 18:28.202
did Amanda tell you
she wanted to replace Marc?

18:28.203 --> 18:29.436
- Uh, constantly.

18:29.437 --> 18:32.739
But Evan korman
would never let that happen.

18:32.740 --> 18:35.376
Marc had a huge fan base.

18:35.377 --> 18:37.611
- We understand he may not
have been doing justice

18:37.612 --> 18:39.279
to the role.

18:39.280 --> 18:43.117
- Amanda blamed everyone
and everything, okay?

18:43.118 --> 18:46.220
She even had a problem
with the songs.

18:46.221 --> 18:47.321
- You disagreed?

18:47.322 --> 18:50.024
- Well, being
as I wrote them, yeah.

18:50.025 --> 18:52.493
You familiar with my work,
detective?

18:52.494 --> 18:54.729
- Oh, uh...

18:54.730 --> 18:57.565
- He's more of a jazz guy.

18:57.566 --> 19:01.236
I really loved <i>Strange Angel.</i>

19:04.240 --> 19:05.440
- Okay, that's for you.

19:05.441 --> 19:07.243
- Oh, well, it's pleasant.

19:09.379 --> 19:12.248
Clove?
- Java black.

19:12.249 --> 19:15.117
I got addicted to 'em
when we toured Indonesia.

19:15.118 --> 19:16.920
- Hmm. Nice.

19:16.921 --> 19:20.123
- Look, the problem...
With the show

19:20.124 --> 19:22.025
is not the songs.

19:22.026 --> 19:23.894
Amanda's on a downward spiral.

19:23.895 --> 19:25.296
- How so?

19:25.297 --> 19:29.166
- Well, uh, no husband,
no kids,

19:29.167 --> 19:31.269
no life outside work.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.337
And the night
that Marc was killed,

19:33.338 --> 19:35.706
I smelled alcohol
on her breath.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.975
She's been
in a.A. For 20 years,

19:37.976 --> 19:39.977
and she is
a handful enough sober,

19:39.978 --> 19:41.678
but now...

19:41.679 --> 19:42.846
She's giving the eulogy

19:42.847 --> 19:44.648
at Marc's memorial service
this afternoon.

19:44.649 --> 19:46.349
- Hey, Adam, got a sec?

19:46.350 --> 19:47.817
- Watch out.

19:47.818 --> 19:49.652
Excuse me.

19:49.653 --> 19:52.121
- "Watch out."

19:52.122 --> 19:54.324
So Amanda told DeWitt

19:54.325 --> 19:57.026
to be in the audience
that night.

19:57.027 --> 19:58.661
She must have had reason
to believe

19:58.662 --> 20:02.132
she could put Brice
on the stage instead of Marc.

20:02.133 --> 20:04.301
- But Marc showed up on time.

20:04.302 --> 20:07.805
Plan "b," she cuts his rigging,

20:07.806 --> 20:10.073
assuming DeWitt
wouldn't review a performance

20:10.074 --> 20:12.509
in which an actor is hurt.

20:12.510 --> 20:13.711
Pretty desperate.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.880
- A bad review can kill a show.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.015
She's got a lot
riding on <i>icarus.</i>

20:18.016 --> 20:20.517
Her last movie
bombed at the box office.

20:20.518 --> 20:23.520
- Let's pay our respects
at Marc's memorial,

20:23.521 --> 20:26.256
see how heartbroken
Amanda really is.

20:26.257 --> 20:27.257
<i>Higher</i>

20:27.258 --> 20:31.094
<i>you have got</i>

20:31.095 --> 20:32.963
<i>to turn</i>

20:32.964 --> 20:35.332
<i>around</i>

20:35.333 --> 20:37.968
<i>- cause this is hubris
- Hubris</i>

20:37.969 --> 20:40.437
<i>- this is hubris
- Hubris</i>

20:40.438 --> 20:42.439
<i>- hubris
- This is hubris</i>

20:42.440 --> 20:44.774
<i>you got to come down</i>

20:44.775 --> 20:49.512
<i>it's so beautiful</i>

20:51.516 --> 20:53.216
- And now I'm honored
to introduce

20:53.217 --> 20:55.685
the amazing Amanda rollins.

20:59.691 --> 21:04.061
- Thank you.

21:04.062 --> 21:08.632
We all have desires.

21:08.633 --> 21:12.636
We all have yearnings
in our hearts...

21:12.637 --> 21:14.705
To be loved...

21:14.706 --> 21:17.874
To be accepted...

21:17.875 --> 21:22.045
To be closer to the divine...

21:22.046 --> 21:23.747
To fly to the sun...

21:23.748 --> 21:26.383
glorious wings...

21:26.384 --> 21:30.387
and to fly higher...

21:30.388 --> 21:32.388
- She's emotional.

21:32.389 --> 21:34.390
- Yeah, alcohol will do that.

21:34.391 --> 21:37.059
- Like my beautiful icarus...

21:37.060 --> 21:39.395
My Marc.

21:39.396 --> 21:42.265
Marc...

21:42.266 --> 21:43.833
You...

21:43.834 --> 21:45.035
- Thank you.
- Marc...

21:45.036 --> 21:46.870
- The brilliant Amanda rollins.

21:46.871 --> 21:48.271
Well done.
Thank you.

21:48.272 --> 21:50.540
Thank you very much.
- Fly high, Marc.

21:50.541 --> 21:52.509
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Fly... I am not done.

21:52.510 --> 21:53.844
- It's okay.
- I am not done.

21:53.845 --> 21:55.412
- Thank you so much.
- Get off of me.

21:55.413 --> 21:57.047
- Hey, hey...
- Get off me!

21:57.048 --> 22:00.433
I wasn't finished!
- Hey, shh.

22:03.436 --> 22:06.038
- They should have sold tickets
to this.

22:15.463 --> 22:16.781
I got this for you.

22:16.782 --> 22:19.017
- Don't spill it.
- Oh, thank you!

22:19.018 --> 22:20.434
You're very kind.

22:21.104 --> 22:25.407
- You told the critic DeWitt
about a cast change.

22:25.408 --> 22:27.460
Did you mean Marc?

22:27.461 --> 22:29.296
- It was just magical thinking.

22:29.297 --> 22:30.564
- You wanted to replace

22:30.565 --> 22:32.499
the actor
you told us you adored.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.601
- He was dead.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.703
I was being...

22:35.704 --> 22:37.171
Generous.

22:37.172 --> 22:39.774
- You forced in
the understudy, Brice,

22:39.775 --> 22:41.041
put the wings on him.

22:41.042 --> 22:42.909
Marc wasn't even
ten minutes late.

22:42.910 --> 22:44.845
- I don't understand.

22:44.846 --> 22:47.247
The labyrinth...

22:47.248 --> 22:49.115
Someone must have given him
a clue.

22:49.116 --> 22:50.517
- A clue?

22:50.518 --> 22:52.118
- Obviously she's
in no condition

22:52.119 --> 22:55.388
to be speaking to the police.
- Al, I'm fine.

22:55.389 --> 22:58.091
I have nothing to hide.
Talk to me.

22:58.092 --> 22:59.392
Ask me anything.

22:59.393 --> 23:02.862
- Okay.

23:02.863 --> 23:06.900
You didn't want DeWitt
reviewing Marc that night,

23:06.901 --> 23:09.202
so you cut the rig,
staged an accident.

23:09.203 --> 23:10.404
- No, I didn't.

23:10.405 --> 23:12.572
- You've been
under a lot of pressure.

23:12.573 --> 23:15.943
A year of living
and breathi <i>icarus,</i>

23:15.944 --> 23:18.745
pouring your heart and soul
into the production.

23:18.746 --> 23:20.981
Maybe you didn't want to turn
out to be another Julie taymor...

23:20.982 --> 23:23.149
get fired
for artistic differences.

23:23.150 --> 23:25.452
- I would never hurt
an actor...

23:25.453 --> 23:26.753
Never.

23:26.754 --> 23:28.388
They're like my children.

23:28.389 --> 23:30.391
- Your naughty children,
who don't listen,

23:30.392 --> 23:31.625
who don't take direction,

23:31.626 --> 23:33.227
who think they know
better than you.

23:33.228 --> 23:35.829
- That's true.
Marc never listened.

23:35.830 --> 23:36.897
He didn't trust me.

23:36.898 --> 23:39.066
For a production like this
to work,

23:39.067 --> 23:41.169
there must be absolute trust.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.571
- You have it, detective.
- We... we didn't have that.

23:43.572 --> 23:45.006
- We're going.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.175
- All right.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.945
- Hi.
Um, I'm taking Amanda home.

23:49.946 --> 23:52.281
- Oh.
- Look, uh...

23:52.282 --> 23:55.084
Whatever she said in there,
she's not herself.

23:55.085 --> 23:58.254
- What put her over the edge
after 20 years sober?

23:58.255 --> 24:01.358
- Well, let's see...
Marc, Adam, Evan.

24:01.359 --> 24:04.527
They're egomaniacs
with inferiority complexes.

24:04.528 --> 24:07.430
It's somewhat de rigueur
for this business.

24:07.431 --> 24:08.831
But, really, to suggest

24:08.832 --> 24:10.767
she had anything to do
with Marc's death,

24:10.768 --> 24:12.836
it's... it's ridiculous.

24:12.837 --> 24:14.838
- Well, you're
a very loyal assistant.

24:14.839 --> 24:16.540
- Uh, dramaturge, actually.

24:16.541 --> 24:18.109
- Right, dramaturge.

24:18.110 --> 24:20.878
- Look, Marc
was screwing someone.

24:20.879 --> 24:23.214
Uh, maybe married.

24:23.215 --> 24:24.782
He kept it on the q.T.
- How do you know?

24:24.783 --> 24:26.384
- Well, the production
was putting him up

24:26.385 --> 24:27.451
at the four seasons.

24:27.452 --> 24:29.120
Then about a month
into rehearsal,

24:29.121 --> 24:32.156
he requested another apartment
at the premier club.

24:32.157 --> 24:34.492
He said it was for when
his mother visited,

24:34.493 --> 24:36.194
but she never did.

24:36.195 --> 24:37.728
- Well, that's very helpful.

24:37.729 --> 24:39.897
- Hi.
Are you all right?

24:39.898 --> 24:41.932
- I-I-I just want to go home.

24:41.933 --> 24:43.901
- Amanda mentioned
something about Marc

24:43.902 --> 24:45.537
getting a clue.

24:45.538 --> 24:48.205
What do you think about that?
- Yeah, I have a thought.

24:48.206 --> 24:49.606
- You care to share?

24:49.607 --> 24:51.074
- No, I'm gonna test
the theory first.

24:51.075 --> 24:54.576
I have an old friend
who teaches, uh, mythology

24:54.577 --> 24:55.911
at Columbia.

24:55.912 --> 24:58.613
- All right, have fun.

24:58.614 --> 25:00.013
- <i>Icarus...</i>

25:00.014 --> 25:03.550
my favorite metaphor
for failed ambition.

25:03.551 --> 25:05.334
Hubris.

25:06.936 --> 25:08.587
Here it is...
the clew.

25:08.588 --> 25:11.656
Uh, c-l-e-w.

25:11.657 --> 25:14.658
Uh, a ball of thread or yarn.

25:14.659 --> 25:18.294
- Right, a ball of yarn
that daedalus gave to theseus

25:18.295 --> 25:21.297
to help him escape
from the labyrinth,

25:21.298 --> 25:23.732
which angered king minos,

25:23.733 --> 25:27.503
who then imprisoned daedalus

25:27.504 --> 25:29.672
and icarus
in the same labyrinth?

25:29.673 --> 25:31.307
- Are you sure
you need my help?

25:31.308 --> 25:32.408
- I do need your help.

25:32.409 --> 25:35.310
Tell me more
about the, uh, labyrinth.

25:35.311 --> 25:38.714
- Well, the word is, uh,
pre-Greek in origin...

25:38.715 --> 25:40.783
minoan.
- I saw this in her office.

25:40.784 --> 25:42.552
The classical labyrinth...

25:42.553 --> 25:44.487
uh, circular in pattern,
unicursal.

25:44.488 --> 25:46.556
- Single path.
- Going in circles,

25:46.557 --> 25:49.092
but one path,
not difficult to navigate.

25:49.093 --> 25:51.561
- You know, in some versions
of the myth,

25:51.562 --> 25:53.362
it's more of a maze...

25:53.363 --> 25:55.798
multicursal, like a puzzle

25:55.799 --> 25:57.666
with choices of direction.

25:57.667 --> 26:01.069
- But the killer...

26:01.070 --> 26:04.138
Thought that
they had no choice.

26:04.139 --> 26:07.507
- Well, whoever it is, Bobby,
one thing I do know.

26:07.508 --> 26:09.409
I know you.

26:09.410 --> 26:11.594
You'll find 'em.

26:14.831 --> 26:17.082
- Don't know where,
maybe england...

26:17.083 --> 26:18.983
- Mm-hmm.

26:18.984 --> 26:22.753
- There were men
on the bridge with me...

26:22.754 --> 26:26.989
Wearing some sort
of military uniform.

26:26.990 --> 26:30.992
And they were walking
the other way.

26:30.993 --> 26:33.027
- And what do you
think it means?

26:33.028 --> 26:35.195
- I don't know... I was hoping
you could tell me.

26:35.196 --> 26:37.697
- They were going one way,
and you were going the other?

26:37.698 --> 26:39.365
- Mm-hmm.
- And the bridge was over water?

26:39.366 --> 26:40.700
- Turbulent water.

26:40.701 --> 26:42.134
I know what you're gonna say.

26:42.135 --> 26:43.936
You're gonna say
it means that I'm

26:43.937 --> 26:47.072
at some kind of
difficult crossing,

26:47.073 --> 26:50.141
that the guys in uniform
were N.Y.P.D.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.542
- Actually, I was struck
by the fact

26:51.543 --> 26:56.281
that this dream is what you
wanted to discuss today.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.549
You want me to know
that my opinion matters,

26:58.550 --> 27:03.221
but now who's asking questions
that he knows the answers to...

27:03.222 --> 27:04.355
Instead of discussing

27:04.356 --> 27:07.692
what happened at the end
of last session?

27:07.693 --> 27:09.394
A week ago, you were furious.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.662
You walked out.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.898
And today, I'm...

27:13.899 --> 27:15.833
I'm not sure
what's on your mind

27:15.834 --> 27:18.001
or... or even
why you came back.

27:18.002 --> 27:21.471
- It's on my mind.

27:21.472 --> 27:23.673
No matter...

27:23.674 --> 27:25.942
What was going on
from your side, you know,

27:25.943 --> 27:29.979
I'm sorry for losing my temper.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.048
I wanted to apologize for that.

27:32.049 --> 27:33.449
- Thank you.

27:33.450 --> 27:34.918
It's fine to apologize,

27:34.919 --> 27:36.753
but I think
we should talk about,

27:36.754 --> 27:40.523
try to reconstruct
what happened between us.

27:40.524 --> 27:43.025
- I told you,
I think I overreacted.

27:43.026 --> 27:44.427
- Yes, and I am suggesting

27:44.428 --> 27:48.698
because something powerful
came up, something important.

27:48.699 --> 27:50.366
Why do you think
you turned so quickly?

27:50.367 --> 27:52.501
- Yeah, we got
our wires crossed.

27:52.502 --> 27:53.936
- Has that happened
to you before?

27:53.937 --> 27:55.404
- What? Come on.

27:55.405 --> 27:57.639
You're telling me that
that's never happened to you?

27:57.640 --> 28:00.009
- You became enraged because
you thought I suggested

28:00.010 --> 28:01.343
you might be hitting on me.

28:01.344 --> 28:03.779
- Look, I don't know
what your angle is with me.

28:03.780 --> 28:07.617
I don't know if you're trying
to get me to fail...

28:07.618 --> 28:09.019
To fall for you.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.221
I don't know if you're trying

28:12.222 --> 28:14.390
to get me to...

28:14.391 --> 28:18.227
Behave crazy,
so you can call the N.Y.P.D....

28:18.228 --> 28:20.729
- so you don't know what the
rules of engagement are here.

28:20.730 --> 28:22.665
So let's talk about that.
- You want to know what I feel?

28:22.666 --> 28:24.566
I feel anger.
- And last week,

28:24.567 --> 28:26.069
you were flooded with it.

28:26.070 --> 28:28.170
Fight or flight.

28:28.171 --> 28:31.357
What's underneath the anger?

28:33.526 --> 28:35.011
- More anger.

28:35.012 --> 28:38.481
- And underneath that, fear...
fear that I'm gonna betray you,

28:38.482 --> 28:40.850
fear that
I'm gonna humiliate you,

28:40.851 --> 28:42.685
that I must be
up to something more

28:42.686 --> 28:44.686
than to get you
to know your own mind.

28:44.687 --> 28:46.321
And that's why you run.

28:46.322 --> 28:49.225
Deep down, if we do this work,

28:49.226 --> 28:52.979
you're justifiably terrified
of what we might discover.

28:59.454 --> 29:02.573
- The police think
that I killed Marc!

29:02.574 --> 29:04.342
- They're just doing
their job, Amanda.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.779
- Do you think I did it?
- Of course not.

29:07.780 --> 29:11.082
- I-I-I need to know
when we're gonna be back up.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.583
We need to rehearse.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.819
The cast
is losing rhythm, energy.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.055
- That may not be happening.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.224
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.960
I gave her an Ambien.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.863
I thought she was asleep.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.798
- You called Roger?

29:26.799 --> 29:29.767
I'm not a child.
- Then stop acting like one.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.253
- This is a nightmare.
- Come on.

29:35.757 --> 29:38.342
- We didn't see Marc Landry
at this hotel very often.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.043
- When you did,
was he with anyone?

29:40.044 --> 29:42.579
- I get paid
to look the other way.

29:42.580 --> 29:45.264
- Uh, that smell.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.435
- A few matchbooks...
not much of a love nest.

29:58.510 --> 30:00.261
- Java black...

30:00.262 --> 30:02.764
same clove cigarettes
Adam winter smokes.

30:02.765 --> 30:04.098
- Rock stars...

30:04.099 --> 30:06.584
don't they know it's not safe
to smoke in bed?

30:09.224 --> 30:12.424
Cigarrete under the bed?
Are you kidding, right?

30:12.425 --> 30:14.692
- So your client is denying

30:14.693 --> 30:17.429
he had an intimate relationship
with Marc Landry?

30:17.430 --> 30:19.732
- Yes.
I'm denying it.

30:19.733 --> 30:22.569
I...Love women.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.272
- Not to mention,
he's happily married.

30:25.273 --> 30:27.341
- So maybe now's
the time to tell you

30:27.342 --> 30:32.079
we have security footage of you
in the premier club elevator

30:32.080 --> 30:33.480
kissing Marc Landry.

30:33.481 --> 30:36.717
- You know, he really
could have been just giving him

30:36.718 --> 30:38.219
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

30:38.220 --> 30:40.221
- Are they
making this up, Adam?

30:40.222 --> 30:41.422
- Okay...

30:41.423 --> 30:43.425
There was a couple of times

30:43.426 --> 30:46.061
he invited me up
to his apartment...

30:46.062 --> 30:48.163
Work on his performance.

30:48.164 --> 30:51.165
- Right, but isn't that
the director's job?

30:51.166 --> 30:53.401
- He hated Amanda,

30:53.402 --> 30:55.469
and she hated him.

30:55.470 --> 30:57.805
- So you were the peacemaker.

30:57.806 --> 30:59.006
- Yes.

30:59.007 --> 31:00.675
Marc was just trying to get me
on his side.

31:00.676 --> 31:03.477
I mean, you...
You got to love actors.

31:03.478 --> 31:05.746
I mean, they're
people pleasers.

31:05.747 --> 31:07.814
- I know. I know.

31:07.815 --> 31:10.517
Anyway, so what happened?

31:10.518 --> 31:13.821
Marc threatened
to tell your wife that...

31:13.822 --> 31:15.989
well, you know,
about your work sessions.

31:15.990 --> 31:19.559
Wait. Maybe it was
his subpar singing.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.961
You were worried how
it would affect your songs.

31:21.962 --> 31:23.196
- No.

31:23.197 --> 31:26.199
- Did you see Marc
the night he died?

31:26.200 --> 31:28.167
- Yes.

31:28.168 --> 31:29.502
Uh, I mean,

31:29.503 --> 31:31.937
we shared his limo together
to the theater.

31:31.938 --> 31:34.507
- Well, he was late. Did you
have anything to do with that?

31:34.508 --> 31:36.542
- No, but he must have had
a new driver,

31:36.543 --> 31:38.377
'cause the guy...

31:38.378 --> 31:41.747
The guy drove around
the same block three times.

31:41.748 --> 31:45.352
- Three times, three times...

31:45.353 --> 31:47.221
Three?
- Yeah.

31:47.222 --> 31:49.724
- Man, I-I had to yell
at the guy

31:49.725 --> 31:51.959
to get him to get back
onto tenth ave.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.828
- That actor...
he distracted me.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.930
- Yeah, you drove him
around in circles, right?

31:55.931 --> 31:58.365
You know, like this, right?
Sort of like a-a labyrinth?

31:58.366 --> 32:03.269
How many times have you been
Amanda rollins' driver?

32:03.270 --> 32:05.404
- Never.

32:05.405 --> 32:09.242
- Well, we'll check
with your supervisor.

32:09.243 --> 32:11.010
- The truth, Mr. vargas.

32:11.011 --> 32:13.846
- I don't want to get
miss Amanda in trouble.

32:13.847 --> 32:14.914
- Is that because she asked you

32:14.915 --> 32:17.516
to drive in circles
that night...

32:17.517 --> 32:19.651
To make sure Marc Landry
missed his curtain?

32:19.652 --> 32:23.155
- She promised me house seats
for <i>icarus.</i>

32:23.156 --> 32:25.557
- But you couldn't go through
with it?

32:25.558 --> 32:27.760
Adam winter was in the car,
big rock star.

32:27.761 --> 32:29.995
You got intimidated,
you turned the car around,

32:29.996 --> 32:32.064
and Marc got
to the theater on time.

32:32.065 --> 32:34.634
- Amanda changed her mind.

32:34.635 --> 32:36.235
Her assistant called my cell,

32:36.236 --> 32:39.088
said, "get Marc to the theater
right away."

32:44.528 --> 32:47.480
- You're packing?

32:47.481 --> 32:50.183
- It'll hit the press tomorrow.

32:50.184 --> 32:52.668
That coward Evan
is closing the show.

32:54.504 --> 32:56.422
- You need to answer
some questions.

32:56.423 --> 32:58.090
- You know what?

32:58.091 --> 32:59.626
I would be so happy

32:59.627 --> 33:01.861
if people would stop telling me
what to do.

33:01.862 --> 33:04.598
What is that, like, payback
for the director?

33:04.599 --> 33:07.167
See how I like it?

33:07.168 --> 33:09.036
You should leave.

33:09.037 --> 33:12.105
- We know
you told Marc's driver

33:12.106 --> 33:13.941
to make him late that night.

33:13.942 --> 33:18.145
- You sent Marc
on this labyrinthine journey,

33:18.146 --> 33:21.382
because you intended to put
Brice onstage that night.

33:21.383 --> 33:23.384
That's why you invited DeWitt.

33:23.385 --> 33:26.153
- I've always thrown myself
into my work

33:26.154 --> 33:28.588
to the exclusion of all else.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.557
It felt safe there...

33:30.558 --> 33:32.258
the one place
I wouldn't have to think

33:32.259 --> 33:34.694
about the things
I was running from.

33:34.695 --> 33:36.062
- I understand.

33:36.063 --> 33:38.064
- But the day before Marc died,

33:38.065 --> 33:40.434
I'd had it.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.203
He wouldn't take
the simplest piece of direction.

33:43.204 --> 33:46.072
I stormed out of the theater.
I drank my lunch.

33:46.073 --> 33:49.509
Poor Roger had to come
pick me up, literally.

33:49.510 --> 33:51.111
- Right, you'd had it.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.079
Marc's late,
put Brice onstage...

33:53.080 --> 33:55.732
it's a good plan,
but you changed your mind.

33:57.935 --> 34:00.254
- Changed my mind about what?

34:00.255 --> 34:02.089
- Your assistant called,

34:02.090 --> 34:04.725
told the limo driver
to be on time.

34:04.726 --> 34:06.677
- No, he didn't...

34:08.780 --> 34:12.565
Or at least
I didn't tell him to.

34:12.567 --> 34:15.768
If you'll excuse me,
I need a drink.

34:15.770 --> 34:18.105
A-a diet soda.

34:18.106 --> 34:19.889
Okay?

34:23.328 --> 34:24.978
- Either Amanda's lying,

34:24.980 --> 34:28.716
or her assistant...
uh, sorry, dramaturge...

34:28.717 --> 34:31.752
Roger, made the call.

34:31.753 --> 34:33.954
But why?

34:33.955 --> 34:36.123
- He wanted to fix things
for Amanda...

34:36.123 --> 34:39.226
Or maybe someone else
involved in the production...

34:39.226 --> 34:42.145
the person who
had the most to lose.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.737
So Marc Landry was killed
to kill the show.

34:50.737 --> 34:53.139
We got the D.A.'S report back

34:53.141 --> 34:55.576
on the <i>icarus</i>
<i>insurance contracts.</i>

34:55.577 --> 34:57.912
There's a force majeure clause

34:57.913 --> 35:02.149
that is specifically linked
to Marc Landry.

35:02.150 --> 35:06.420
In an injury or death
to the lead actor,

35:06.421 --> 35:08.856
there's a full payout
to all the investors.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.157
No one loses a dime.

35:10.158 --> 35:11.492
- Two days before
Marc was killed,

35:11.493 --> 35:14.162
Evan korman had
a half-hour conference call

35:14.163 --> 35:15.530
with insurance agents,

35:15.531 --> 35:18.166
going over the details
of the force majeure clause.

35:18.167 --> 35:21.169
- The producer wanted
his own star killed.

35:21.170 --> 35:23.205
- It was the only way
to stop the bleeding,

35:23.206 --> 35:25.541
and he had someone
on the inside to do the job.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.443
- How do you prove it?

35:27.444 --> 35:29.178
- With the help
of some egomaniacs

35:29.179 --> 35:32.231
with inferiority complexes.

35:34.734 --> 35:38.855
- You have evidence
that Roger killed Marc?

35:38.856 --> 35:40.223
This is horrible.

35:40.224 --> 35:42.859
But I don't know
what you want me to do.

35:42.860 --> 35:45.194
- Well, uh, he looks up to you.

35:45.195 --> 35:48.731
And we thought that if...

35:48.732 --> 35:50.633
We put you in a room with him

35:50.634 --> 35:53.402
that you might be able to...

35:53.403 --> 35:56.740
Persuade him to confess.

35:56.741 --> 35:59.076
- I want to help,
of course, but I...

35:59.077 --> 36:01.161
- That's my partner.

36:03.231 --> 36:04.682
- Hi. Hey.

36:04.683 --> 36:06.918
Uh, sorry about this, Evan.

36:06.919 --> 36:08.920
The police said that they...

36:08.921 --> 36:12.056
They have some new evidence
about Marc's death.

36:12.057 --> 36:14.826
- We do.

36:14.827 --> 36:17.529
The thing is...

36:17.530 --> 36:20.982
We found your fingerprints
on the rig.

36:25.954 --> 36:29.006
- I told the police there
must be a good explanation.

36:29.007 --> 36:32.443
- What...
what are you talking about?

36:32.444 --> 36:36.347
- If there's anything
you want to tell us, Roger...

36:38.017 --> 36:40.852
Well, I... yeah, I might
have touched the rigging.

36:40.853 --> 36:42.354
I was at the stunt rehearsal.

36:42.355 --> 36:44.256
- Right, right.
Well, that's one explanation.

36:44.257 --> 36:46.125
Can you think of what
the other one might be?

36:46.126 --> 36:48.794
- Oh, what, like, I killed him?

36:48.795 --> 36:51.831
- Marc's performance
was driving Amanda to drink.

36:51.832 --> 36:54.133
You were worried.

36:54.134 --> 36:57.270
You did call Evan's office
several times.

36:57.271 --> 37:00.640
- Did you, uh...
did you tell them that?

37:00.641 --> 37:03.209
- I'm sure you only meant to...

37:03.210 --> 37:05.111
Hurt Marc, not kill him.

37:05.112 --> 37:06.746
- What?

37:06.747 --> 37:08.815
No, no.
That's not true.

37:08.816 --> 37:10.918
- Actually, we think
it is true.

37:10.919 --> 37:15.322
We think that Marc's fall
was supposed to just injure him,

37:15.323 --> 37:19.192
sideline him
from the production.

37:19.193 --> 37:22.895
Isn't that the instructions
that you gave Roger?

37:22.896 --> 37:23.996
- I beg your pardon?

37:23.997 --> 37:25.865
- You see, we found a clause

37:25.866 --> 37:28.835
in your insurance policy...

37:28.836 --> 37:31.804
uh, force majeure,
"act of God."

37:31.805 --> 37:34.007
- That's boilerplate.
- Not quite.

37:34.008 --> 37:36.909
Your policy has a rider.

37:36.910 --> 37:39.879
If your star
is incapacitated or dies,

37:39.880 --> 37:43.349
your investors recoup
all their money.

37:43.350 --> 37:44.850
- Come on, Evan.

37:44.851 --> 37:48.221
It was a barn burner
of a disaster, right?

37:48.222 --> 37:51.858
A catastrophe,
a money-sucking catastrophe.

37:51.859 --> 37:54.427
I think...
A career-ender.

37:54.428 --> 37:55.896
- How dare you?

37:55.897 --> 37:57.798
- You know, it must
have been tough,

37:57.799 --> 37:59.900
your father looking
over your shoulders every day.

37:59.901 --> 38:02.336
And now he's looking down on you
from the great white way

38:02.337 --> 38:04.672
in the sky, and he's thinking,

38:04.673 --> 38:07.241
"I fathered...

38:07.242 --> 38:10.144
An entitled embarrassment."

38:10.145 --> 38:13.380
- All productions
have problems.

38:13.381 --> 38:16.883
- Not front-page headlines
in the <i>daily news</i> every day.

38:16.884 --> 38:19.986
You're the laughingstock
of Broadway.

38:19.987 --> 38:22.088
- That's ridiculous.
Tell 'em, Roger.

38:22.089 --> 38:23.656
- W-what am I supposed
to tell?

38:23.657 --> 38:25.324
- He wants you to do
what you've always done...

38:25.325 --> 38:27.693
back his play.
He's your boss, right?

38:27.694 --> 38:30.196
- Roger works for Amanda,
not me.

38:30.197 --> 38:31.531
- You're lying.

38:31.532 --> 38:33.400
But that's what producers do,
isn't it?

38:33.401 --> 38:34.534
You lie for a living.

38:34.535 --> 38:36.670
- Yeah, well,
so are the police.

38:36.671 --> 38:39.406
Roger was hired by Amanda.

38:39.407 --> 38:41.842
- That's not true.

38:41.843 --> 38:43.843
- Thanks for joining us.

38:43.844 --> 38:45.679
- What the hell is going on?

38:45.680 --> 38:47.013
- Oh, we doubled back
with Ms. rollins

38:47.014 --> 38:50.417
when we heard
about that force majeure clause.

38:50.418 --> 38:54.421
Apparently, you insisted
she hire Roger.

38:54.422 --> 38:55.822
- Not true.

38:55.823 --> 38:57.957
- Oh, cut the crap, Evan.

38:57.958 --> 39:00.226
You know I wanted
Barbara widrow as my dramaturge.

39:00.227 --> 39:01.794
- Can't you see she's wasted?

39:01.795 --> 39:04.464
Go to a meeting,
Amanda, dry out.

39:04.465 --> 39:05.765
- Oh, no, I'm sober.

39:05.766 --> 39:07.934
I can see so clearly,
it's scary.

39:07.935 --> 39:09.302
- Why would you agree to Roger?

39:09.303 --> 39:11.271
Why replace
your own dramaturge?

39:11.272 --> 39:13.706
- My dramaturge was expensive.

39:13.707 --> 39:16.242
Evan said if I wanted to take
out the theater seats

39:16.243 --> 39:18.811
to built the labyrinth,
I'd have to make sacrifices.

39:18.812 --> 39:20.346
So I agreed to hire Roger.

39:20.347 --> 39:22.814
- Who was essentially a spy
for Evan.

39:22.815 --> 39:26.151
- I had no clue that Roger
worked for Evan.

39:26.152 --> 39:28.253
- Okay, I referred Roger.

39:28.254 --> 39:30.588
But if he killed Marc,
that has nothing to do with me.

39:30.589 --> 39:32.456
- Right.

39:32.457 --> 39:35.893
You know, we thought
that you might have killed Marc

39:35.894 --> 39:37.728
to support Amanda's vision.

39:37.729 --> 39:40.832
But, you know, now we know
that you did it for Evan.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.300
You see, we googled you...

39:42.301 --> 39:45.470
six credits on shows
that Evan produced

39:45.471 --> 39:48.740
since you...
y-you graduated...

39:48.741 --> 39:51.577
Yale drama.

39:51.578 --> 39:53.946
You're a Yale man!

39:53.947 --> 39:55.681
A dramaturge!
- Stop it!

39:55.682 --> 39:58.484
- You know, it must be hard
for artists these days,

39:58.485 --> 40:01.120
you now, the crass commercial
considerations

40:01.121 --> 40:04.790
and never-ending
pursuit of...

40:04.791 --> 40:06.459
Profit.

40:06.460 --> 40:07.927
You know, profit.

40:07.928 --> 40:10.030
Yeah, I guess that's why
they call it show <i>business.</i>

40:10.031 --> 40:14.200
But in the end,
you are an artist, right?

40:14.201 --> 40:16.703
You create illusions, you know.

40:16.704 --> 40:20.123
You live in a world
of make-believe.

40:22.660 --> 40:26.346
But this...
This is real.

40:26.347 --> 40:27.781
Somebody's dead.

40:27.782 --> 40:29.483
There's a body at the morgue.

40:29.484 --> 40:31.252
And what got him there?

40:31.253 --> 40:33.820
Your fear of failure.

40:33.821 --> 40:35.989
- Bravo. I'm gonna have to cast
you in my new production

40:35.990 --> 40:37.123
with that performance.

40:37.124 --> 40:39.926
- You killed a man
to save your reputation.

40:39.927 --> 40:42.794
And you killed a man because you
wanted to be a producer?

40:42.795 --> 40:46.764
Really? To share a marquee
with Evan korman...

40:46.765 --> 40:50.601
son of the late, great,
legendary irwin korman.

40:50.602 --> 40:53.471
- Share a marquee?
Please.

40:53.472 --> 40:55.440
Roger is no producer.

40:55.441 --> 40:57.609
He's got no...

40:57.610 --> 41:00.645
Balls.

41:00.646 --> 41:02.180
- Is that right, rog?

41:03.983 --> 41:07.185
It was Evan's idea.

41:07.186 --> 41:09.621
He told me to stage
the accident.

41:09.622 --> 41:12.290
He said, "it would be
best for everyone

41:12.291 --> 41:14.092
if it would just end."

41:14.093 --> 41:15.827
The investors would get paid.

41:15.828 --> 41:19.264
The whole thing would be over.

41:19.265 --> 41:22.901
- You gonna believe him?

41:22.902 --> 41:24.904
There's no proof
of any of this.

41:24.905 --> 41:26.638
I'm calling my attorney.

41:26.639 --> 41:28.674
- Evan!
- Yeah?

41:28.675 --> 41:31.376
- I recorded
our conversations...

41:31.377 --> 41:33.945
every single one of them.

41:33.946 --> 41:36.081
I had this in my pocket!

41:36.082 --> 41:39.334
And it has all of your detailed,
specific instructions!

41:42.906 --> 41:44.223
- What?

41:44.224 --> 41:47.292
- Because I wanted to make sure
that I got it right!

41:47.293 --> 41:51.297
I wanted to do a good job
for you, you prick!

41:51.298 --> 41:52.798
- You little...

41:52.799 --> 41:55.000
- easy!

41:55.001 --> 41:58.804
- You whining,
cheating criminal.

41:58.805 --> 42:00.990
- I learned from the best.

42:05.995 --> 42:07.947
- What made
the two of you think

42:07.948 --> 42:11.049
that you could get away
with murder?

42:12.986 --> 42:14.586
- Hubris.

42:14.587 --> 42:17.105
- Show's over.

42:18.305 --> 42:24.545
