00:08.342 --> 00:09.408

00:09.410 --> 00:11.543

       I'm Tommy Gobbler.

    Thanksgiving happiness!

                 - There you go!

00:24.225 --> 00:26.225
- These are
the Davidsons.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.359

         what happened

00:27.361 --> 00:29.528
        to their missing

  I don't know why I did that.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.282

           staying late tonight?

       slow-cook a goose,

        normal cook her.

                    overcrowded,

animal kingdom nonsense.

need me for?

          I love you.
        Just hurry back.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.475
    - I love you too, baby.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.411
       Put Jake on, okay?

05:12.413 --> 05:13.445
      - Hey there, Sarge.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.780
     Everything is totally
         under control.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.315
          As you know,
        her water broke

05:16.317 --> 05:17.850
         and she's had
   a couple of contractions.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.384
       And--hey, Sharon,

05:19.386 --> 05:20.686
       how are you doing
           vaginally?

05:20.688 --> 05:21.687
            - What?

05:21.689 --> 05:22.688
      Don't ask her that!
            - Okay.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.823
            <i> - Jake,</i>
       <i> all you have to do</i>

05:24.825 --> 05:26.358
    <i> is keep her comfortable.</i>

05:26.360 --> 05:27.392
         I'm on my way.
      - Okay, sounds good.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.061
    And do you want to just
  meet us at the hospital or--

05:29.062 --> 05:30.729
       both: No hospital!

05:30.731 --> 05:31.863
        - Okay. Got it.
            Got it.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.365
       Cool, cool, cool.
          No hospital.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.099
        I am picking up
  what you're screaming down.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.467
      - We had a terrible
           experience

05:35.469 --> 05:36.702
     when Cagney and Lacey
           were born.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.103
      - Last time we went
        to the hospital,

05:38.105 --> 05:39.805
         they pushed me
      to have a C-section,

05:39.806 --> 05:41.506
   didn't have enough rooms,

05:41.508 --> 05:43.742
    and the anesthesiologist
       was a med student

05:43.744 --> 05:45.911
         who stabbed me
       in the spinal cord

05:45.913 --> 05:47.879
        ten times before
        he got it right!

05:47.881 --> 05:49.915
                          - See?
          Needles in your spine?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.917
                   Childbirth is
                 a horror movie.

05:51.919 --> 05:52.918
     - That is not helping.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.486
            - Jake,
     there's a copy of our

05:54.488 --> 05:55.887
     birth plan on my desk.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.556
        Call the doula.
          - Copy that.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.858
     I will call the doula.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.560
     Which is a thing that
 I definitely know what it is.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.928
      - A doula is someone
        who supports you

06:02.930 --> 06:04.363
          emotionally
         and physically

06:04.365 --> 06:05.397
    and coaches you through
          the process.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.365
          - Oh, I see.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.033
        So sort of like
       a vaginal Gandalf?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.134
    -<i> Stop saying that word!</i>

06:09.136 --> 06:10.753
     - Ooh, that's actually
     a pretty good analogy.

06:10.754 --> 06:12.371
    - Well, Sharon liked it,
             Sarge.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.373
  All right, listen, you have
    nothing to worry about.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.374
      I've got it totally
      under control here.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.943
         Love you, bye.
             Great.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.811
        So I'm gonna go
      get your birth plan

06:19.813 --> 06:21.747
        and then summon
          your wizard.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.615
   - Oh, Sharon, I heard you had
                 gone into labor

06:23.617 --> 06:24.816
          in our police station.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.651
        I hope you don't
     contract an infection.

06:26.653 --> 06:27.786
   - Yeah, we all hope that.

06:27.788 --> 06:28.954
- Hey, Cap-i-tan,

06:28.956 --> 06:30.155
Could I speak with
you outside

06:30.157 --> 06:32.657
for just one moment?

06:32.659 --> 06:34.426
       - Don't leave me.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.828
      - Listen, you've got
     your plate full today,

06:36.830 --> 06:38.964
         and this whole
   Sharon having a baby thing

06:38.966 --> 06:40.699
    is honestly beneath you.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.467
       - But I know a lot
       about childbirth.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.669
        My ex-boyfriend,
    Frederick was an OB/GYN

06:44.671 --> 06:46.972
       and we would often
      talk about his work.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.508
   Before he started talking
        about it with...

06:49.510 --> 06:50.909
             Dave.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.778
     - Well, you should probably
                know that I also

06:52.780 --> 06:54.713
        have a lot of experience
                with childbirth.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.448
   <i> - And, with a final grunt,</i>

06:56.450 --> 06:58.784
        <i> the mighty rhino</i>
        <i> expels her calf.</i>

06:58.786 --> 07:00.652
             - Ugh!

07:00.654 --> 07:03.889
             Gross!
 Come out of an egg next time.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.590
    - I'm gonna go check in
           on Sharon.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.459
      Make sure she's not
     pushing prematurely--

07:07.461 --> 07:08.627
     fatiguing the uterus.

07:08.629 --> 07:12.464
                   - Okay, wait,
          you can't talk to her!

07:12.466 --> 07:14.466
          Terry doesn't want you
                       in there.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.602
                    You make her
                  uncomfortable.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.870
- I make her
uncomfortable?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.439
                       - [sighs]

07:20.441 --> 07:21.873
- Well, that's ridiculous.

07:21.875 --> 07:22.874
I should go confront her

07:22.876 --> 07:23.875
about this at length.

07:23.877 --> 07:24.876
                     - No, wait!

07:24.878 --> 07:26.011
                  You could, but

07:26.013 --> 07:27.346
              I think that would
         probably stress her out

07:27.347 --> 07:28.680
      and we're trying to
    keep her calm right now.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.014
                So maybe just...

07:30.017 --> 07:31.783
                  Focus on work?

07:31.785 --> 07:32.818
- Of course.

07:32.820 --> 07:33.819
I only want to help.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.520
Whatever's best
for Sharon.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.521
           - Really?
           - Mm-hmm.

07:36.523 --> 07:37.656
         - You're fine
           with that?

07:37.658 --> 07:38.957
         - Absolutely.
  I don't take it personally.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.959
     I mean, it's about me
 and my behavior, specifically,

07:40.961 --> 07:42.794
         nobody else--
    not Hitchcock or Scully,

07:42.796 --> 07:45.497
      but yeah, I'm fine.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.665
    What a joyous occasion.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.235
- So...

07:50.237 --> 07:51.636
Sharon's water
just broke.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.904
              - Are you kidding?
                       Let's go!

07:52.906 --> 07:54.005
- Hold up.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.775
This guy knows where
our murderer is hiding.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.910
Just give me two minutes
alone with him.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.745
I'll let him know what's
gonna happen to him

08:00.747 --> 08:02.547
if he doesn't cooperate.

08:02.549 --> 08:03.648
[crying]
I'm gonna miss the birth

08:03.650 --> 08:05.250
of my child!

08:05.252 --> 08:06.952
It's a magical moment!

08:06.954 --> 08:08.854
                      - [crying]
                     Okay, okay!

08:08.856 --> 08:10.522
                   I'll tell you
                     everything.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.857
                   Thank you for
              letting me be part

08:11.859 --> 08:13.892
               of this wonderful
                     experience.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.760
- You're a terrible
person,

08:15.762 --> 08:17.762
but you're welcome.

08:17.764 --> 08:18.964
- There you go.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.265
All right.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.700
Safe and sound.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.802
So I spoke with
your doily--

08:23.804 --> 08:25.070
            - Doula.
          - So close.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.505
And, unfortunately,
she is

08:26.507 --> 08:27.572
out of town
for Thanksgiving.

08:29.209 --> 08:29.541
            - What?

08:29.542 --> 08:29.874
- I also spoke with
your backup doula,

08:30.177 --> 08:30.876
who is in town.

08:31.144 --> 08:31.877
        - Oh, thank God.

08:31.879 --> 08:32.977
- But is assisting
with another birth.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.078
                          - Ugh!

08:34.081 --> 08:35.881
          Should not have paused
    between those two sentences.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.816
            - Yeah.
     - Jake, where's Terry?

08:37.818 --> 08:39.083
- I don't know,
exactly,

08:39.086 --> 08:40.519
but everything
is okay.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.620
I have familiarized
myself

08:41.621 --> 08:43.288
with the soothing section
of your birth plan,

08:43.289 --> 08:44.756
and I will now
speak in a low,

08:44.758 --> 08:46.625
calming,
Barry White voice.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.859
[imitating Barry White]
Oh, yeah.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.694
Just breathe, baby.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.929
       - You're making me
          more tense.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.564
- Yeah, I get why.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.700
I'm doing a bad,
bad job, girl.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.669
     - How about we put on
      some relaxing music?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.738
    I think that Terry's got
     some CDs on his desk.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.106
- Oh, great.
Hey, Gina, can you grab those?

09:01.108 --> 09:02.974
       - I have made the
       mistake of looking

09:02.976 --> 09:04.976
      at the birthing plan
        and just learned

09:04.978 --> 09:06.878
     what an episiotomy is.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.781
   I'm gonna need 90 minutes.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.650
- Okay.
I'll grab the CDs.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.752
Be right back.

09:13.754 --> 09:14.886
         Oh, hey, sir,
        thank you again

09:14.888 --> 09:15.987
         for letting us
        use your office.

09:15.989 --> 09:16.988
                     - I'm fine.

09:16.990 --> 09:17.989
                     I'm getting
              a lot of work done

09:17.991 --> 09:18.990
            here at Gina's desk.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.058
                 It's wonderful.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.148
         She has all my favorite
                   chewing gums.

09:21.149 --> 09:22.237
- Okay, well,
I'm just getting

09:22.238 --> 09:23.326
some CDs from
Terry's desk

09:23.330 --> 09:25.630
to help relax
Sharon.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.465
              - I don't know why
              you're telling me.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.299
               I'm not involved.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.935
                   You made that
                     very clear.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.739
- All right.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.041
      - Do you work here?
            - I do.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.809
           - My son was arrested
                  six hours ago,

09:37.811 --> 09:39.010
                      and nobody
                     can tell me

09:39.012 --> 09:40.145
          when he's getting out.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.146
               What is going on?

09:41.148 --> 09:43.815
        <i> [crowd arguing]</i>

09:43.817 --> 09:44.883
           - Uh-huh.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.017
              Yup.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.152
        Great question.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.054
        I will be right
        with you folks.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.355
        [door shutting]

09:51.258 --> 09:52.757
             Guys, we have clear
           some of these people.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.025
       I'm trying to keep things
                calm for Sharon,

09:54.027 --> 09:55.160
        and this is not helping.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.595
- I don't know
what to tell you.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.679
I'm already writing
dangerously fast.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.762
It's Smudge City
here, Jake.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.764
Smudge City!

09:59.766 --> 10:00.765
   - I mean, the problem is,

10:02.636 --> 10:03.001
          we only have
        one fax machine,

10:03.002 --> 10:03.367
   and it takes four minutes
           per page.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.837

   to have a baby, all right?

It was all Scully.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.789

            everyone knows that.

     a very soothing tune.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.113
Is there a fire?

11:05.114 --> 11:06.430
     - All right, I'm gonna
       go check this out.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.799
            Sharon,
         you stay here

11:07.801 --> 11:09.000
      and prepare to jump
        out the window.

         saved the day.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.247

                ten fax machines

11:22.249 --> 11:24.115
                 into one outlet
              and caused a fire.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.884

   extinguisher and was like,

    "The fire extinguisher's
          over there."

11:27.788 --> 11:29.120

       the toaster oven!

11:29.122 --> 11:30.989

is freaking out Sharon.

Does anyone know
how to turn it off?

11:34.895 --> 11:35.960

Can you turn it off?

I'll do it!

        You didn't jump.

Is everything okay?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.774

       flick this switch

11:49.776 --> 11:51.943

     the old alarm-a-roono.

              I thought you were

14:54.261 --> 14:56.461
        Think positive thoughts.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.329
                       You're in
         a Channing Tatum movie.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.431
      You're in a Channing Tatum
                          movie.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.033
- I don't like
Channing Tatum.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.035
               - I'm not talking
                         to you.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.036
           [knocking]

15:06.940 --> 15:08.273
             - Please don't slam
                 the door again.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.041
                We have a bit of
            a medical situation.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.109
            - Well,
      I wish I could help,

15:11.111 --> 15:12.477
       but unfortunately,
          I have a bit

15:12.479 --> 15:14.279
        of a wooden duck
           situation.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.947
                    - Excuse me,
                       what now?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.382
- Still on about
the duck, Frederick?

15:17.384 --> 15:19.384
Years ago,
when we moved in together,

15:19.386 --> 15:21.319
an antique duck
decoy of his

15:21.321 --> 15:22.320
was misplaced.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.355
     - It wasn't misplaced.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.224
          You threw it
         in the trash.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.293
          And with it,
       our relationship.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.028
         - Oh, please.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.229
     We had other problems.

15:31.231 --> 15:34.032
          Or have you
       forgotten about...

15:34.034 --> 15:35.033
             Dave?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.701
          - Dave and I
         were coworkers

15:36.703 --> 15:38.069
       and nothing more.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.071
                 - Nothing more.
                          Right?

15:40.073 --> 15:41.372
                 Problem solved,
            everybody's friends.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.340
           Let's go help Sharon.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.108
       - I will be happy
         to assist you

15:44.110 --> 15:45.510
    if you will just admit,
            Raymond,

15:45.512 --> 15:47.478
         that you threw
    my decoy in the garbage.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.947
- That will never happen

15:48.949 --> 15:50.114
because it's not true.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.115
Thank you for nothing.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.383
Good day.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.384
                           - Hi.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.586
                  Would you mind
             just standing there

15:55.588 --> 15:56.487
        with your glorious beard
                 for one moment?

15:56.489 --> 15:58.122
             I'll be right back.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.090
What the hell?

15:59.092 --> 16:00.325
Just tell him what
he wants to hear.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.326
               - But it's a lie.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.194
- I don't give
a crap, sir.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.263
Sharon needs a doctor,
so get over yourself.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.065
Tell him you threw
away his stupid duck,

16:07.067 --> 16:08.366
then give him 20 bucks
to buy a new one.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.201
                 - It cost $740.

16:12.005 --> 16:12.704
- What?

16:12.705 --> 16:13.404
That is an insane price
for a duck!

16:13.405 --> 16:14.104
That's way too much!

16:14.107 --> 16:16.007
All right, now I'm angry
about the wrong thing.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.509
Look, just fix
this for Sharon.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.282
- Frederick, the duck
was ugly and gross

16:24.284 --> 16:25.350
and I threw it
in the garbage.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.384
             - Wow.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.385
          Well, I know
       what I'm thankful

16:27.387 --> 16:28.987
     for this Thanksgiving:

16:28.989 --> 16:30.021
           The truth.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.022
     [motorcycle rumbling]

16:31.024 --> 16:32.256
        <i> [intense music]</i>

16:32.258 --> 16:34.258
      [cell phone ringing]
     - My phone's ringing!

16:34.260 --> 16:37.128
           Oh--Oh no!
              No!

16:37.130 --> 16:38.463
      [motorcycle rumbles]

16:38.465 --> 16:40.098
           - [sighs]

16:40.100 --> 16:42.100
       Terry's still not
      answering his phone.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.202
     Why am I the only one
   who cares about this baby?

16:44.204 --> 16:46.037
                    - [laughing]

16:46.039 --> 16:48.006
   - Hey, what took so long?
          Is she okay?

16:48.008 --> 16:50.208
  - Yeah, I was just telling her
          the entire duck story,

16:50.210 --> 16:53.011
         now that it finally has
            a satisfying ending.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.112
          No, everything's fine,

16:54.114 --> 16:55.179
               but I am a little
                       concerned

16:55.181 --> 16:57.081
                  about Sharon's
                 blood pressure.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.050
                     And this is
         a terrible environment.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.151
- I wouldn't call
it terrible.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.486
              - We're surrounded
                   by criminals,

17:01.488 --> 17:02.754
                 there's no bed,

17:02.755 --> 17:04.021
                and you can hear
                 the faint sound

17:04.023 --> 17:06.023
            of someone screaming
          through all the vents.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.125
      - That's Hitchcock.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.227
        His arm's stuck
      in a pneumatic tube.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.029
        It's hilarious.
         - [chuckling]

17:11.031 --> 17:12.195
            - In my professional
                        opinion,

17:12.198 --> 17:14.232
                Sharon should go
                to the hospital.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.233
         [door opening]

17:15.234 --> 17:17.335
- [heavy breathing]

17:17.337 --> 17:18.502
                          - Hey.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.204
            So the doctor thinks

17:21.207 --> 17:23.074
                    we should go
                to the hospital.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.308
       both: No hospital!

17:24.310 --> 17:25.542
                - Yup, I thought
             you might say that.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.612
               Look, I can't get
                a hold of Terry.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.314
- Ugh, that one
was rough.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.817
Oh, maybe I should
listen to the doctor.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.152
What do you think?

17:34.153 --> 17:35.486
            - Sharon, it doesn't
            matter what I think.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.088
               You and the sarge
                    have a plan.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.423
- Yeah, but the plan
changed, like,

17:38.425 --> 17:40.224
five horrible
things ago.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.459
I'm in a lot of pain.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.828
I mean, I know we said
no hospital, but--

17:43.830 --> 17:45.129
I don't want to
risk anything

17:45.131 --> 17:47.498
by making
a stupid mistake.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.200
Look, you're my
god-husband.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.335
                  - We both know
         that's a fake position.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.304
- Not anymore.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.239
What would you do?

17:55.241 --> 17:56.407
                       - [sighs]

17:59.212 --> 18:00.378
        Where's Sharon?
          - Room 41B.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.679
- Look, I'm sorry.
I know you said--

18:01.681 --> 18:03.114
         - Don't go to
         the hospital!

18:03.783 --> 18:04.482
- I tried calling you,
you didn't pick up.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.084
     - So you decided to do

18:06.086 --> 18:09.153
   the exact opposite of the
     one thing I told you?

18:09.155 --> 18:10.321
- I thought it was the
right thing to do, Terry.

18:10.322 --> 18:11.488
Look, she's in there
with Captain Holt's

18:11.491 --> 18:12.657
ex-boyfriend right now,

18:12.659 --> 18:13.825
but don't worry,
I made him promise

18:13.827 --> 18:15.159
to stop bringing
up the duck.

18:15.829 --> 18:16.794
      - What the hell are
       you talking about?

18:16.796 --> 18:17.829
             - I--
        - You know what?

18:17.831 --> 18:19.197
         I'll deal with
           you later.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.215
- Seems like you already
dealt with me.

18:20.216 --> 18:21.232
        I got the gist,
          we're good.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.567
- Peralta,

18:22.569 --> 18:25.503
can I confess
something to you?

18:25.505 --> 18:27.338
I didn't throw Frederick's
duck in the garbage.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.606
      - Yes, I know, sir.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.541
- I didn't throw
the duck in the garbage.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.709
I threw it off a bridge.

18:31.711 --> 18:35.613
         <i> [funky music]</i>

18:35.615 --> 18:37.115
    - Why would you do that?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.117
- Well, Frederick and
I were having problems.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.118
He knew I disliked
the duck

18:40.120 --> 18:41.385
because of
its weak beak,

18:41.387 --> 18:43.154
but he insisted on
displaying it anyway.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.188
I acted out

18:44.190 --> 18:46.324
in a petty manner.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.159
Just as I did today.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.627
I'm sorry that
I wasn't more helpful.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.529
          - It's fine,
         I understand.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.197
      You might find this
        hard to believe,

18:53.199 --> 18:56.334
 but I can be a little childish
       sometimes, myself.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.735
- Yes.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.337
You have gum in your
hair right now.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.205
            - Noted.
             - Hey!

19:01.207 --> 19:02.440
- Hey!
You guys came.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.541
What about all
the paperwork?

19:03.543 --> 19:04.642
      - We got it all in.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.645
    Filed 900 forms by hand
       in under 12 hours.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.147
         It was tough,
         but worth it.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.365
        We wouldn't have
          missed this.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.582
            - Also, we had to go
               to the ER anyway.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.451
             Hitchcock's arm was
            mangled by the tube.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.752
                        - I'm in
               unspeakable pain.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.521
- Oh.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.489
    Ugh, this is agonizing.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.424
                     - It's been
                   over an hour.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.361
         This has to be a record
         for longest childbirth.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.762
         - It's a girl!

19:24.764 --> 19:28.166
     [cheers and applause]

19:29.335 --> 19:31.502
         - Her name is
         Ava Jeffords.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.638
        She's 14 pounds,
          six ounces.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.173
            - Whoa.

19:35.909 --> 19:36.841
   - Oh yeah, Terry Jeffords
       makes big babies.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.242
    Guys, I just want to say

19:38.244 --> 19:39.310
     thanks to all of you.

19:39.312 --> 19:42.213
        Charles and Amy
       filling out forms.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.781
             Rosa,
        I'm so thankful

19:43.783 --> 19:45.249
        you got me here
         on that bike.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.317
- I'm thankful
I could help.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.318
   - I'm thankful that I'm--

19:47.320 --> 19:48.519
                - Boyle, this is
                clearly a moment

19:48.521 --> 19:49.587
           between him and Diaz.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.589
        - Captain Holt,
   you brought me the doctor

19:51.591 --> 19:54.192
      that brought my girl
        into the world.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.693
           And Gina,
 I know you got past your fears

19:55.695 --> 19:56.694
     and helped Sharon out.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.396
     - I'm so happy for you

19:58.398 --> 19:59.797
    and I never want to see
         your daughter

19:59.799 --> 20:01.399
     or remember this day.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.201
  - And Hitchcock and Scully,

20:03.203 --> 20:05.203
      I assume you're here
   for some unrelated injury.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.637
               - That's correct.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.638
            - Jake.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.273
         Can I see you
         for a minute?

20:09.275 --> 20:10.575
- Oh. Yeah.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.411
- It's a girl.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.446
       - Ouch! Worth it.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.348
         - Sharon and I
        wanted you to be

20:17.350 --> 20:20.618
        the first person
          to meet Ava.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.488
           - Oh, wow.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.592
        She's beautiful.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.560
               - I'm sorry I got
                  angry earlier.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.828
             You did a great job
                          today.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.631
                    Hospital was
             the right decision.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.334
              I'm so glad you're
                Ava's godfather.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.736
              I'm so glad you're
           Sharon's god-husband.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.771
              I'm so glad you're
                    my god-wife.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.441
             I have no idea what
       I'm saying at this point.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.277
- Thank you, Jake.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.378
         - You want to hold her?

20:47.380 --> 20:48.713
          - Oh, um...

20:48.715 --> 20:50.615
          Yeah, sure,
        that'd be great.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.101
               - The baby, Jake!

20:53.102 --> 20:55.586
            - Yeah!
Right, right, the normal thing.

20:55.588 --> 20:55.619
        - Not a doctor.
             - Shh.
