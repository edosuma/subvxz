00:12.637 --> 00:14.180
-[sighs] Morning, Mom.
-Hey.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.474
So, remember how I was upset
about missing school

00:16.558 --> 00:18.476
and having to FaceTime into my classes?

00:19.477 --> 00:22.480
Do I remember you throwing yourself
on my bed and yelling,

00:22.564 --> 00:25.024
"The doctors are ruining my life"?

00:26.818 --> 00:27.819
Vaguely.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.449
Well, Katie and I came up with
the perfect solution.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.159
[tablet chimes]

00:36.369 --> 00:38.621
Bam! Portable Alexa.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.707
Oh!

00:40.790 --> 00:42.459
I like this!

00:42.542 --> 00:45.462
See? Now when you go away to college,
we never have to be apart.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.717
Yeah, too bad my college
has really bad reception.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.926
[chuckles] Bye.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.183
Now Katie and I can still compete
to be chairs in the dance committee.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.686
Mm. I love that they still let
the freshmen plan the Winter Formal.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.147
Oh, I remember when I won
with the theme...

01:04.230 --> 01:05.648
[both] ..."Winter Wonderland."

01:07.275 --> 01:10.070
Well, I may have mentioned it.
I was hoping to inspire you.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.405
Well, you did inspire me...

01:13.698 --> 01:15.658
Ha! Surf's up!

01:15.742 --> 01:17.368
...to go a totally different way!

01:17.452 --> 01:20.080
Winter Luau!

01:21.122 --> 01:23.750
It's a luau in the middle of winter.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.297
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

01:32.425 --> 01:36.888
Girls, selecting the Winter Formal theme
is a proud tradition at Kennedy High.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.640
Which, again, I won.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.769
Don't worry, Lori. We've been getting
ready for it since middle school.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.145
We're gonna win it.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.315
Yeah, well, we're not gonna win by using
the same old tired ideas.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.566
[scoffs]

01:51.069 --> 01:53.530
That were groundbreaking at the time.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.117
Well, I hope you can do this from home.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.326
We got this.

01:58.409 --> 02:01.204
Yeah, Alexa will be on the iPad
and I'll be there.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.164
By myself.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.708
In front of everyone.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.254
I hope this works
with you doing it at home.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.465
Sure! We're partners.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.467
It will be like we're there together.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.302
Right.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.262
Right!

02:17.804 --> 02:19.430
B-But don't forget to take me.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.307
Right.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.146
[tablet chimes]

02:27.689 --> 02:29.107
-Did you miss me?
-Mm.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.192
Mm-hm. You know, a little bit.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.403
OK.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.280
Take a big breath.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.366
You're going in my backpack.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.077
Oh, no! It's dark in there!

02:43.413 --> 02:47.333
[sighs] I got your brother on the bus,
but we had to chase it for two blocks.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.168
I swear that driver saw me.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.754
But now I'm the bad guy
for throwing a rock at the back window.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.634
Aw! You know, I remember
when we used to run after the bus.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.845
Remember when I let you throw the rock?

03:00.138 --> 03:01.598
Best birthday ever.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.603
Oh, man! Jack never showed me this.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.396
Today is Parent Career Day.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.607
[sighs] If I miss another school event,

03:10.690 --> 03:13.026
they're gonna take away
my "World's Best Mom" mug.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.404
Hey, didn't you find that
on a soccer field?

03:16.487 --> 03:17.906
I'd like to think that it found me.

we'll take turns bringing her with us.

[Alexa] I have to say,
I'm not hating this.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.781
I can go online, paint my toenails...

04:52.125 --> 04:57.130
Ah. Tomorrow, we select
dance committee chairs in the cafeteria.

04:57.213 --> 05:02.218
[chuckles] Now, when I was a freshman,
some lame-o won with Winter Wonderland.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.139
Katie, we should go last and finish big.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.932
[whispers] Class started.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.810
Homeroom isn't a real class. [scoffs]

05:10.893 --> 05:12.603
I'm sorry, what was that, Mendoza?

05:12.687 --> 05:13.521
Oh, uh...

05:13.604 --> 05:15.690
No, I was just talking about
our presentation.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.442
Oh, I-I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.693
-No!
-Could you speak up?

05:18.776 --> 05:20.278
Coach, I love homeroom!

05:20.361 --> 05:22.155
[muted]

05:23.489 --> 05:24.741
Nice!

05:25.325 --> 05:27.368
I wish all my students
had a volume button.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.335
Thank you, Leila's mom,

05:36.794 --> 05:39.088
and her partner, Lego!

05:42.467 --> 05:44.427
Dave, what are you doing here?

05:44.510 --> 05:47.055
Jack asked me to come for Career Day.
I thought you knew.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.556
Why would he do that?

05:48.639 --> 05:50.725
Well... I'm a pilot.

05:50.808 --> 05:51.809
[Dave chuckles]

05:53.978 --> 05:55.063
Jack.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.314
Oh, hey, Mom.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.774
Why did you ask Dave to come?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.192
He's a pilot.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.820
Up next, we have Jack's neighbor,

06:02.904 --> 06:04.405
Dave Mendoza.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.870
Well, I am and... it's exciting.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.458
But uh Jack's mom
has a really cool job, too.

Hi, everybody!

06:24.759 --> 06:26.427
for a big insurance firm!

I-I sit at a desk on a fun exercise ball,

06:39.816 --> 06:41.484
and I solve people problems.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.737
Ooh, I already have a question. Yes?

06:45.530 --> 06:47.448
Have you ever flown through lightning?

06:47.532 --> 06:48.658
All the time.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.494
Once, we lost power in two engines...

06:51.577 --> 06:52.954
[children gasp]

06:53.037 --> 06:55.832
But uh... this is Jack's mom's time.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.168
Uh... An amazing thing about HR--

06:59.252 --> 07:01.921
-How fast does your plane go?
-Have you ever flown upside down?

07:02.004 --> 07:03.673
Can you land on the ocean?

07:06.300 --> 07:09.137
-Yeah, just...
-Well, i-if you're sure.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.513
Yeah. [sighs]

07:12.890 --> 07:14.225
I guess I could uh...

07:15.893 --> 07:17.103
Picture it.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.396
You're on the runway.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.190
Five hundred tons of metal underneath you.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.984
The engine screams,

07:23.067 --> 07:25.361
the wheels lift off the tarmac,

07:25.445 --> 07:28.781
and that big bird
goes hurtling into the sky.

07:28.865 --> 07:29.699

07:30.908 --> 07:33.286
-Who wants their wings?
-[children] Me!

07:33.369 --> 07:35.413
-[boy] I do! I do!
-That's my neighbor!

07:37.373 --> 07:39.041
How hard can it be to fly a plane?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.294
-[Lego barks]
-Lego gets it.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.631
Reagan, I cannot believe you did that.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.592
How could you just leave me in there?

07:47.675 --> 07:50.678
She's all yours.
She had her lunch but she's still cranky.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.973
She forgot me in the bathroom.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.350
I've seen things.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.604
Don't worry.
I won't put you down for a second.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.856
[Katie grunts]

08:01.939 --> 08:04.901
Katie, I heard about
your Winter Luau theme.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.152
That's perfect.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.570
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.113
Someone has to get last place.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.284
My theme is Enchanted Ice Castle.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.995
It's a winner.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.665
[stammers] M-More like a wiener!

08:19.749 --> 08:21.042
[chuckles]

08:23.419 --> 08:25.087
That did not work.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.507
Was that Gwenny? What's her idea?

08:28.090 --> 08:29.133
Oh, Ice Castle.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.218
[Alexa laughs]

08:30.301 --> 08:32.261
That's perfect, since she's the Ice Queen.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.055
[laughs]

08:34.138 --> 08:36.432
[groans] Oh, see, I should have said that.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.434
You should be here.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.228
I can never think on the fly.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.397
What if something goes wrong
when we present tomorrow?

08:43.481 --> 08:45.107
Hey, we'll be fine.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.527
Just don't stick me
under your armpit again.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.153
It's scary in there.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.536
Hey! What's up? It's Breakfast Boy!

08:57.119 --> 08:59.455
Word on the street
is that you ate your eggs good.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.374
I mean, just like you should.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.708
[both laugh]

09:02.792 --> 09:04.710
[feigns laughter]
How do you know about that?

09:06.295 --> 09:08.297
My mom saw it on your mom's Instagram.

09:08.381 --> 09:12.301
[Alexa] But what am I supposed to do?
The same thing's gonna happen to me.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.762
Alexa, I need to talk to Mom right now!

09:14.845 --> 09:17.723
No, Mom's busy. But let's talk about
what she's been posting.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.433
Adorable!

09:21.686 --> 09:22.687
Thanks, Katie.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.232
OK, OK.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.818
So, try to think of the equation
like a story.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.697
Like, if LeBron scored twice as many jump
shots as Steph Curry, then how many--

09:32.780 --> 09:34.824
Wait. Who's home court?

09:34.907 --> 09:36.993
And who's guarding him?

09:37.076 --> 09:38.786
Is it giveaway day at the arena?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.623
OK, now you're just trying
to get out of studying.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.084
You are smart.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.212
Speaking of basketball,

09:48.296 --> 09:51.549
I got you this
when I heard you were in the hospital.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.718
Oh. That was nice.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.012
Now you can shoot hoops from your bed.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.140
-I felt bad you couldn't go to school.
-Don't feel sorry for me.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.643
I don't feel sorry for you.
I just got you a basketball hoop, so...

10:02.727 --> 10:03.936
[cell phone ringing]

10:04.645 --> 10:06.772
-Hey.
-I stopped by Wired to get us mochas.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.817
And I put your iPad down for, like,
two seconds and now it's gone.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.235
Everything's on that iPad.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.820
You're on that iPad!

10:12.903 --> 10:14.614
Also, I drank two mochas.

10:16.198 --> 10:19.577
OK, calm down.
Someone probably just took it by mistake.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.245
Um... Who's there?

10:21.329 --> 10:25.541
-Sherry, Michael, Todd, Gwenny, Erin--
-Wait, wait! Go back.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.043
[scoffs] Oh!

10:27.126 --> 10:29.837
[chuckles] Of course! Classic Todd.

10:29.920 --> 10:30.921
No!

10:31.505 --> 10:32.381
Gwenny!

10:32.465 --> 10:36.218
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She's working on her Ice Castle plans.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.096
She definitely took the iPad.
You have to confront her.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.933
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not...
I'm not historically good at that. Um...

10:43.017 --> 10:46.062
But I am, and this will be great practice
for our presentation.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.065
Put your earbud in, go over to her
and just say exactly what I say.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.608
We're getting that iPad back.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.777
OK. Let's do it!

10:52.860 --> 10:53.861
Let's do it!

10:57.657 --> 10:59.950
-Gwenny.
-What do you want?

11:00.034 --> 11:00.868
Listen to me.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.453

23:10.931 --> 23:14.017
Oh, God, no. But I really enjoyed it.

23:24.486 --> 23:25.487
There's your solo.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.450
Can I hang out over here?

23:32.953 --> 23:34.204
I guess that's a yes.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.874
Mom talked to my class again.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.962
-How did it go?
-Not good. There was some biting.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.548
OK.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.883
I wish she had a cool job like yours.

23:47.467 --> 23:50.053
Are you kidding me?
Your mom has one of the coolest jobs.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.930
She doesn't get hit by lightning.

23:53.974 --> 23:54.975
No.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.520
But if a person
did get struck by lightning at work,

23:58.603 --> 24:00.063
they would have to talk to your mom.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.315
So she talks to cool people?

24:02.399 --> 24:03.400
No.

24:04.192 --> 24:05.986
Cool people talk to her.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.446
And that's not her only job.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.657
She's a mom, a chef,

24:10.740 --> 24:12.909
a chauffeur, a personal shopper.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.995
She's in charge of everything.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.121
Wow.

24:16.204 --> 24:19.291
-She's like the president of your family.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.543
There you are.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.796
About this afternoon,
I just wanted to say...

24:26.298 --> 24:27.340
Thank you.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.425
For what?

24:29.301 --> 24:30.468
Everything.

24:31.887 --> 24:32.971
Wow.

Hey, babe.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.989
All of your friends
love the video of you I posted.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.699
What's wrong with them?

24:53.408 --> 24:56.244
Yeah, I've been getting texts
all afternoon.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.246
Honey, that was so sweet of you.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.749
I think everybody's jealous
that I'm so close to my boy.

25:00.832 --> 25:01.833
Mwah!

25:02.459 --> 25:04.127
It's supposed to be embarrassing!
