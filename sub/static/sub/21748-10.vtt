00:14.139 --> 00:15.974
[muffled] Give it a moment.

00:16.057 --> 00:18.560
Nothing gets by me, Tina.
Uno what I'm thinking?

00:18.643 --> 00:21.104
-[mutters]
-I don't think you have any blues.

00:21.187 --> 00:24.065
I think you put the wild card down,
and chose blue,

00:24.149 --> 00:26.192
because you want us
to think you have blues.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.820
-Just go already!
-Uh, excuse me.

00:28.903 --> 00:32.198
I am employing
a little something called "strategy."

00:32.282 --> 00:34.826
I am taking my time because
I enjoy being the center of attention.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.619
Until I put a card down,
you have to listen.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.329
It's been your turn
for ten minutes.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.457
Well, since you're being so impatient,

00:40.540 --> 00:43.126
I'm gonna put my thing down,
flip it and reverse it back to Tina.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.544
-[groans]
-[growls] Uno.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.755
So you <i>did </i>have blues. <i>Touch√©.</i>

00:46.838 --> 00:50.216
Henrietta, don't use a foreign language
in front of the child.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.426
She'll get ideas.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.219
-It's your turn, Beatrice.
-Ah, ah, ah, ah!

00:53.303 --> 00:55.513
-You okay, Hollyhock?
-Yeah, I'm-- I'm awesome.

00:55.597 --> 00:56.639
I feel really good.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.183
I just-- I need a glass of water.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.769
Oh! Beatrice, trying to slip
a nine on a six.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.730
You think I've never seen
an old niner-sixer before?

01:03.813 --> 01:05.899
-Ah! Ow!
-Whoa, are-- are you okay?

01:05.982 --> 01:07.692
I'm fine! I just-- Ow!

01:07.776 --> 01:09.903
Did you cut yourself?
It's okay. I know what to do.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.280
You need some alcohol, ice,
a squeeze of lemon.

01:12.363 --> 01:15.408
-You'll forget all about your cut.
-I'll be right back.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.659
One.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.120
[panting]

01:20.205 --> 01:21.331

What's the big deal?
I have hands too.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.907
There's no way those new hands
are as perfect as everyone says.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.368
Nobody's hands are all the way clean.
Computer, zoom in on that thumb.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.121
And enhance. Zoom in again.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.456
Enhance again.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.334
Zoom in three more times.
Enhance. Enhance.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.377
Now zoom out once.
De-enhance.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.670
Okay.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.796
What are you doing?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.882
Quiet, "Face."

Computer, take a scan

03:39.469 --> 03:41.846
[printer whirring]

03:41.930 --> 03:45.391
-Ha! Just what I expected.
-What?

03:45.475 --> 03:48.561
<i>Before Woodchuck,</i>
<i>the hands belonged to one</i>

03:48.645 --> 03:53.399
<i>Ernest Contralto, a criminal.</i>
<i>The man was a pedophile murderer.</i>

03:54.734 --> 03:56.903
<i>Well, if you gotta murder somebody...</i>

03:56.986 --> 04:01.699
<i>No, Tom. Not a pedophile-dash-murderer.</i>
<i>A pedophile-slash-murderer!</i>

04:01.783 --> 04:05.286
<i>Oh, no! The way you said "slash"</i>
<i>was very scary!</i>

04:05.370 --> 04:09.582
<i>At first I didn't like him,</i>
<i>on account, uh... he didn't have hands?</i>

04:09.666 --> 04:12.168
<i>But then he got new hands,</i>
<i>so I liked him again?</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:15.797
<i>But then I found out those hands are bad!</i>
<i>Can't trust politicians.</i>

04:15.880 --> 04:18.049
She's killing us on this hands thing.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.385
Much like Ernest Contralto
killed those innocent children

04:20.468 --> 04:23.513
after he pedophiled them,
with those very hands.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.639
Not helping!

04:24.722 --> 04:27.267
Your hands are being
really aggressive right now.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.978
-[groans]
-Watch out! They're attacking your face!

04:33.606 --> 04:35.900
Hey, girl, whatcha working on?
Getting some clicks?

04:35.984 --> 04:39.612
Get them clicks, girl.
Get. Them. Clicks.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.157
I'm working on another big piece
about how Jessica Biel is owned

04:43.241 --> 04:44.826
by private prison lobbyists, who want--

04:44.909 --> 04:49.622
Oh, my Gaia, Diane, nobody cares.
I care and I don't even care.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.542
So imagine how little
someone who doesn't care cares.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.086
-Well...
-What if you had lunch with her?

04:55.169 --> 04:56.587
-Why would--
-You could write about

04:56.671 --> 04:58.965
what she smells like,
how she makes her face pretty.

04:59.048 --> 05:02.510
These are things people will want
to know about our first female governor.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.012
Ugh!

05:05.596 --> 05:08.057
[screeching]

05:08.141 --> 05:09.809
I'll have the avocado toast.

05:09.892 --> 05:13.104
But instead of the avocado part,
I want fresh sea air,

05:13.187 --> 05:16.107
and instead of the toast,
I'll have a single grain of rice.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.319
-And for you?
-Grilled cheese?

05:19.402 --> 05:22.030
Thank you for meeting me here, Diane.
I just wanted to tell you,

05:22.113 --> 05:24.574
you can keep writing
whatever you want about me.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.367
Obviously, it has no effect on the polls,

05:26.451 --> 05:30.079
because the only thing voters care about
is stupid bullshit, so knock yourself out.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.333
Well, today I just want to know
what you smell like.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.961
It's actually my new fragrance:
"Bielist," by Jessica Biel.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.338
-Your perfume's called "B"-list?
-"Bielist."

05:39.422 --> 05:41.841
"B"-list. Like a "B"-list celebrity.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.595
-No, "Bielist" like Jessica Biel.
-I think we're saying the same thing.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.847
Do you want some?
I got a whole trunk of this stuff.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.307
-No, thanks.
-You sure?

05:49.390 --> 05:51.267
Mr. Peanutbutter always loved
the way I smelled.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.561
Well, I wouldn't flatter
yourself too much.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.064
He's very enthusiastic
about smelling in general.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.066
He's enthusiastic about everything.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.277
Oh, my God. Does he still have
that dumb magic eye poster?

06:01.360 --> 06:02.570
What? No.

06:02.653 --> 06:05.198
When we were married,
he was obsessed with it.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.076
And he would make me
stare at it for hours.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.285
Yeah, I bet.

06:09.368 --> 06:13.122
But then, all of a sudden, I saw it.
And it was incredible.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.374
And I was so happy
that I had waited long enough

06:15.458 --> 06:18.336
to experience this beautiful thing,
and I felt so...

06:18.419 --> 06:20.129
Why is this disgusting avocado
on my plate?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.632
-Oh, I...
-I feel personally attacked right now.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.217
-Oh, so sorry.
-[retches]

06:24.300 --> 06:26.719
Anyway,
as I was saying about the poster,

06:26.803 --> 06:30.765
it's funny how something so stupid
could have this tremendous power.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.433
You know what I mean?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.519
Yeah. I think I do.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.648
<i>A blog post about Jessica Biel</i>
<i>is gaining attention</i>

06:38.731 --> 06:40.233
<i>for the seemingly minor detail</i>

06:40.316 --> 06:42.902
<i>that the candidate</i>
<i>would not eat an avocado,</i>

06:42.985 --> 06:45.905
<i>calling the savory fruit,</i>
<i>quote, "disgusting."</i>

06:45.988 --> 06:47.490
<i>Who doesn't like avocados?</i>

06:47.573 --> 06:51.077
<i>I don't know if Jessica Biel</i>
<i>has the right judgment to lead California.</i>

06:51.160 --> 06:53.204
<i>And I was totally convinced before,</i>

06:53.287 --> 06:54.705
<i>-so it's really...</i>
<i>-Whoa!</i>

06:54.789 --> 06:57.166
<i>...the avocado thing</i>
<i>that I have a problem with.</i>

06:57.250 --> 07:00.586
Why would you say
that you hate avocados?

07:00.670 --> 07:02.922
I just have to live my truth, Katrina.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.924
[groaning]

07:05.007 --> 07:07.969
<i>Her polls,</i>
<i>like an avocado exposed to air,</i>

07:08.052 --> 07:11.389
<i>have quickly turned from a verdant green</i>
<i>to a mushy brown.</i>

07:11.472 --> 07:13.516
<i>And with only seven days</i>
<i>until the election,</i>

07:13.599 --> 07:16.102
<i>her campaign might be in the pits.</i>

07:16.185 --> 07:19.063
Wow. Who'da thunk
that such a small trivial detail

07:19.147 --> 07:20.731
could be the thing to take Biel down?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.191
Yeah, who'da thunk it?

07:22.275 --> 07:23.693
Who knew?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.447
I knew. I put the avocado thing
in the story on purpose,

07:27.530 --> 07:28.865
I knew people wouldn't like it.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.533
So just for the record, I "thunk" it.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.618
Even though it doesn't matter.
I don't need credit.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.121
But it does, if I didn't do that,
it wouldn't have happened.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.289
So, it's because of me.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.875
-Well, whoever is responsible--
-Me. I just told you.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.585
We shouldn't get too excited just yet.

07:40.668 --> 07:44.297
The election is a week away,
and a lot can happen in a week.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.299
This is far from over.

07:47.633 --> 07:52.013
<i>It's over. And the clear winner</i>
<i>is Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.</i>

07:52.096 --> 07:53.598
-All right!
-Huzzah!

-We did it!
-High five! [laughs] Low five!

-We did!

08:02.106 --> 08:05.735
You and me, working together,
both contributing the same amount.

08:05.818 --> 08:09.071
Well, I wrote the article
that got Woodchuck elected governor.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.616
You're the one that made him
not governor in the first place.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.410
I set 'em up. You knock 'em down.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.497
Thank you for meeting me here.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.625
My name is Yolanda Buenaventura
of the Better Business Bureau.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.128
It would be funnier
if your name was Betty Buenaventura

08:24.212 --> 08:25.463
of the Better Business Bureau.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.007
Well, I'm sorry you don't find
my name sufficiently comical,

08:28.090 --> 08:30.176
but this is actually
a very serious matter.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.719
-Oh.
-We've received complaints

08:31.802 --> 08:33.137
from several concerned parents.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.431
It seems that many
of your clown dentists

08:35.515 --> 08:37.808
aren't actually licensed
to practice medicine.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.311
Isn't laughter the <i>best</i> medicine?

08:40.394 --> 08:42.104
No. It is the worst medicine.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.815
If you can even call it medicine,
which, legally, you cannot.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.736
Well, what if I said my business
was for entertainment purposes?

08:48.819 --> 08:51.280
That would require your employees
to be entertaining.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.534
According to your reviews on Yelp,
your clown dentists are, quote,

08:54.617 --> 08:58.412
"A cotton candy nightmare of Freudian
invention that shakes one to the core."

08:58.496 --> 09:00.248
Ah, everyone's a critic.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.333
On Yelp? Yes, that is the idea.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.378
It appears your business provides
no service but to terrify children

09:05.461 --> 09:06.879
and the adults who accompany them.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.257
If this were October,
you could market your venture

09:09.340 --> 09:11.259
as some sort of spooky
Halloween experience,

09:11.342 --> 09:14.178
but since this is January,
a month which, to my knowledge,

09:14.262 --> 09:16.764
contains no Halloweens,
I have no choice but to--

09:16.847 --> 09:18.057
Wait! Wait.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.351
What if my clown dentists
put on a show?

09:20.434 --> 09:26.566
A delightful, whimsical,
non-terrifying clown-stravaganza?

09:26.649 --> 09:28.109
You would have to agree

09:28.192 --> 09:30.194
we were a legitimate
business then, right?

09:30.278 --> 09:33.239
-Go on.
-Give us a week. We'll put on a show.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.658
If you don't laugh,
I'll dissolve the business

09:35.741 --> 09:38.661
and release all my clown dentists
into the woods,

09:38.744 --> 09:41.038
where they'll never bother anyone again.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.081
All right.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.750
You have one week to create a show
that delights and astonishes me.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.961
But I should warn you,
I am a very tough crowd.

09:47.044 --> 09:50.089
I once met Paul Rudd at a cocktail party
and I did not find him charming.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.970
-[bell ringing]
-Ooh!

09:56.053 --> 09:58.306
-Excuse me.
-[overlapping chatter]

09:58.389 --> 10:01.434
-Get outta my way.
-Like, hooked in a funny way.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.895
You call that funny?
That's not funny. It's sad.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.064
Well, some would argue
that sad and funny

10:07.148 --> 10:10.192
-are two sides of the same coin.
-[cries out]

10:10.276 --> 10:13.195
Uh, no! Abraham Lincoln
and some weird flat house

10:13.279 --> 10:14.780
are two sides of the same coin.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.824
-Take five, Picarello.
-[bell ringing]

10:16.907 --> 10:20.036
[groans] I've got a week
to whip these dentists into clowns.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.162
-[crashing]
-[moaning]

10:21.245 --> 10:23.164
But they're just not silly or wacky

10:23.247 --> 10:25.833
or prone to kooky hijinks of any kind!

10:26.834 --> 10:27.877
[sad quack]

10:27.960 --> 10:30.087
-[gulping]
-[groans] Should you be drinking that?

10:30.171 --> 10:35.217
Why not? I got no baby or boyfriend.
Might as well get blotto, right? [hiccups]

10:35.301 --> 10:39.347
-Um, shouldn't you be at work?
-I'm recal-bibrating.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.598
-[horn honks]
-Oh!

10:40.681 --> 10:42.683
-[horn honking]
-Ohh...

10:42.767 --> 10:44.268
Hey, maybe you should--

10:44.352 --> 10:48.189
-[phone buzzing]
-Judah, look at my phone! Judah!

10:48.272 --> 10:51.359
-You have a meeting with Flip McVicker.
-[groans]

10:51.442 --> 10:53.402
Tell his gal I'm running ten minutes late.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.072
What gal?

10:59.533 --> 11:02.411
-So, you're a writer?
-Oh, actually that's a typo.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.788
It should say "Waiter."

11:03.871 --> 11:06.248
-But I'm an aspiring writer.
-Uh-huh.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.667
Sorry, that was a joke.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.919
That's the kind of witty repartee
you can expect from--

11:10.002 --> 11:11.712
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the business card.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.922
Wait, ya know,

11:13.005 --> 11:15.383
-I have this idea for a TV show.
-Oh?

11:15.466 --> 11:18.386
It's a grizzled former detective
who gets sucked back in--

11:18.469 --> 11:19.637
This sounds fabulous.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.680
Why don't you write a script,
we'll go from there?

11:21.764 --> 11:24.809
-I already wrote it. Boom.
-Oh, you brought it with you.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.812
I don't trust email.
You know, the government.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.022
Yeah. Look, Flip, before I even read this,

11:30.106 --> 11:33.067
I should tell you
that this town's a total crapshoot.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.944
Odds of the right person
finding your material

11:35.027 --> 11:39.198
and connecting with it
are a million to... one.

11:39.281 --> 11:43.744
I just know I have this great potential
inside me. I know I can do it.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.956
Even if no one else understands
or believes in me.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.791
I'm sure that sounds pretty stupid but...

11:48.874 --> 11:51.919
It's not stupid. I believe in you.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.881
I don't know how else to describe it

11:55.965 --> 11:59.301
other than this feeling
of supreme warmth came over me,

11:59.385 --> 12:01.554
like this is what I've been waiting for
my whole life.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.847
That's amazing!

12:02.930 --> 12:06.434
Todd, the world is dark and scary
and full of creepy clown dentists...

12:06.517 --> 12:08.602
They're working very hard
to be less creepy.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.397
But when I hold this script in my hands,
I have hope.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.066
I gotta get this made.
What do I always say?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.318
"What's the difference
between an agent and a manager?"

12:16.402 --> 12:19.029
Uh, managers are always
talking about the differences

12:19.113 --> 12:22.199
between agents and managers
and agents don't as much?

12:22.283 --> 12:25.953
No! Managers can produce!
This script is a sign.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.247
I gotta get off my ass
and produce this baby.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.457
Todd? [hiccups]

12:29.540 --> 12:32.251
Get me a meeting with Turtletaub.
Set something up with his gal.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.836
Who is this gal?

12:33.919 --> 12:37.089
[snoring]

12:37.173 --> 12:40.092
Okay. Clentists, assemble!

12:40.176 --> 12:41.552
[clowns clamoring]

12:41.635 --> 12:44.263
Wipe those serious looks
off your faces and listen up!

12:44.346 --> 12:45.806
We gotta help Princess Carolyn,

12:45.890 --> 12:48.517
but also we gotta prep
for our big show next week.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.395
If only there was a way
to do both at once.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.522
What a ludicrous notion!

12:53.606 --> 12:57.193
Doctor Picarello,
we might make a clown out of you yet!

12:57.276 --> 12:59.278
Oh, joy!

13:00.279 --> 13:01.697
[cackling]

13:01.780 --> 13:03.324
Special delivery.

13:04.158 --> 13:08.954
This next part is critical. Remain wacky.
This is a highly frivolous situation!

13:11.540 --> 13:14.752
-What's in the package?
-It's a hand delivery item.

13:14.835 --> 13:15.878
Hey!

13:15.961 --> 13:19.882
-Now, Doctor Boing Boing!
-I am in position.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.595
[straining]

13:24.678 --> 13:26.847
All right, Princess Carolyn, sit tight.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.266
-[grunts]
-Whoa!

13:29.350 --> 13:33.395
...before, so it's really the avocado
thing that I have a problem with.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.564
[grunts]

13:38.442 --> 13:39.860
Target is acquired.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.530
[mimics static] Deliver the goods,
Doctor Boing Boing!

13:44.073 --> 13:45.157
Ah!

13:45.241 --> 13:47.952
It's sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-showtime!

13:48.035 --> 13:49.870
-Whoa!
-Oh!

13:49.954 --> 13:52.665
-Princess Carolyn!
-Lenny, thanks for making time.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.208
Didn't realize I had.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.793
[sniffing] Are you drunk?

13:55.876 --> 13:57.920
You smell like somebody
tried to put out a fire

13:58.003 --> 13:59.588
at the booze factory with more booze.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.216
Uh, new perfume, "Sealist," by Seal.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.969
Now let's get to brass stacks.

14:05.052 --> 14:08.973
So it's a hot young writer.
It's TV. It's me producing.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.808
-"TV?"
-Just look at this script.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.060
I know it's gonna knock your socks off.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.728
Eh...

14:15.854 --> 14:17.982
Know that website,
"What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com,"

14:18.065 --> 14:19.984
you go to when you want
to know what time it is?

14:20.067 --> 14:20.985
Yeah.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.654
They look to make a play
in the gritty prestige streaming world,

14:23.737 --> 14:26.073
and it could make a big splash
with a huge ad buy.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.868
Plus, you got the built-in audience
who don't know what time it is.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.078
That's huge! That's so many people!

14:31.161 --> 14:33.414
Yeah, yeah, this could be perfect
as their first series,

14:33.497 --> 14:34.790
but we'd have to get in fast.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.625
They wanna premiere
before Daylight Savings.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.419
Let's set the pitch for next week.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.254
<i>Philbert?</i> Who's Philbert?

14:40.337 --> 14:42.882
He's this grizzled
but very good-looking detective

14:42.965 --> 14:45.134
who gets sucked back in to something.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.302
No, I mean who <i>is </i>he?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.178
-You got a star attached?
-Not yet, but...

14:48.262 --> 14:49.972
Eh, we can't go in without a big name.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.809
TV pitching is like the Israeli flag,
it's nothing without a big star.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.102
Sorry, Princess Carolyn.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.478
No! Fish!

14:57.062 --> 14:59.899
Oh, whoa... ooh, spinny.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.903
Uh-oh! She is out like sauerkraut.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.197
[mimics static] Don't let Turtletaub
get back to his office.

15:07.281 --> 15:11.035
This sounds like a job
for the "Waltz of the Rubber Chicken"!

15:11.118 --> 15:13.579
[Todd] <i>Doctor Picarello,</i>
<i>you gotta revive Princess Carolyn.</i>

15:13.662 --> 15:15.581
Give her ten cc's of honka-honka.

15:15.664 --> 15:16.874
<i>-Stat!</i>
-[honking]

15:16.957 --> 15:18.000
Oh!
[groans]

15:19.001 --> 15:20.544
Hey! Hey! Pardon me. Excuse me!

15:20.628 --> 15:23.213
-Oh! Allow me to lead, my lady.
-Wow.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.800
-What the shell is this?
-So beautiful.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.887
It says so much
without saying anything at all.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.722
You gotta be kidding me.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.432
Okay, okay, how about Aaron Eckhart?

15:33.515 --> 15:35.684
He owes me a favor
and he can disappear into any role.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.646
Yeah, he can disappear so good,
the audience disappears with him.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.189
-Tony Shalhoub!
-Tony Sha-who-ub?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.650
This is
"What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com,"

15:42.733 --> 15:44.568
not "What-time-is-it-fifteen-years-ago

15:44.652 --> 15:48.113
-dot-Geocities-dot-com-
slash-<i>Monk</i>-fanpage."

15:48.197 --> 15:50.491
Please. I need this so bad.
You don't understand.

15:50.574 --> 15:54.036
This project is my ba...
[hiccups] my ba...

15:54.119 --> 15:56.830
-It's my baby.
-Well, if you can't attach a real star,

15:56.914 --> 15:58.290
-your baby's dead.
-No!

15:58.374 --> 15:59.750
Oh, thank you.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.294
There's gotta be a name
that does something for you.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.965
Uh, Jack Huston... Hugh... Hugh Jackman.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.549
-BoJack Horseman!
-There's someone...

16:07.633 --> 16:08.801
-Corbin Bernsen.
-No.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.844
-Ben Mendelsohn.
-No, no, no. Hold on.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.807
-BoJack. That's an idea.
-Yeah, yeah, sure. A BoJack-type.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.017
[sighs] I swore I'd never work
with that asshole again,

16:17.101 --> 16:18.686
but you gotta admit he's got heat.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.271
Star of <i>Secretariat,</i>
disappears for a year,

16:21.355 --> 16:25.150
shows up again to do one episode
of a reality show about butts.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.151
Right, but--

16:26.235 --> 16:29.154
And then you get him playing
a rich, complex anti-hero like Philbert,

16:29.238 --> 16:32.992
now there's a show that screams,
"What time is it right now?"

16:33.075 --> 16:34.284
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.953
I'm saying, there are a lotta guys...

16:36.036 --> 16:37.913
P.C., can you get me BoJack or not?

16:37.997 --> 16:41.125
-Of course I can.
-I'll send over a contract, iron-clad.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.502
I don't want to risk that jerkwad
skipping town again.

16:43.585 --> 16:46.630
-Make sure he signs it before the pitch.
-Uh, will do.

16:46.714 --> 16:50.926
And, uh, go easy on the sauce, huh, kid?
Sloppy don't suit you.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.430
<i>‚ô™ Rubber chicken</i>
<i>Rubber chicken ‚ô™</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:56.390
Ah, I got that damn thing
stuck in my head.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.100
Guys, that was amazing!

16:58.183 --> 17:01.353
But if we're going to convince Yolanda
we're ready for the big top,

17:01.437 --> 17:03.731
we need to really hunker down
over the next week

17:03.814 --> 17:07.151
and put together a show
so undeniably hilarious

17:07.234 --> 17:11.530
and life-affirming,
that she has no choice but to say...

17:13.574 --> 17:17.494
Wow! What a great show!
Okay, you can keep your business...

17:17.578 --> 17:18.787
-Hooray!
-Perfect!

17:18.871 --> 17:21.457
...is what I <i>would</i> say
if you'd put on a good show.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.460
Just so you understand the rubric
when I declare my actual reaction,

17:24.543 --> 17:26.045
which is: "I did not enjoy that."

17:26.128 --> 17:29.673
-[clamoring]
-Oh, no! My hooray was premature!

17:29.757 --> 17:33.677
So I must recommend that
you dissolve this venture immediately.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.972
All right, you heard the lady.
Get into the car, everyone.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.976
I'm taking you to the woods,
out by the old abandoned insane asylum,

17:41.060 --> 17:43.604
near the elementary school
where you belong.

17:43.687 --> 17:44.772
[horn honks]

17:44.855 --> 17:46.732
[snoring]

17:46.815 --> 17:48.650
Hey, so I'm taking
the rest of the day off.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.902
What? Why?

17:49.985 --> 17:51.612
Just don't feel like working right now,

17:51.695 --> 17:55.532
so I think if I force it,
I'm just gonna do a bad job.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.658
Thank you, Stuart.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.161
But I did want to remind you
about that bitch meeting you have

17:59.244 --> 18:02.414
-this afternoon at that clock website.
-You mean the pitch meeting.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.334
Pretty sure it said "bitch" meeting
on the calendar.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.795
Seemed a little harsh.
I could go double-check,

18:07.878 --> 18:10.923
but the calendar's
all the way downstairs so...

18:11.006 --> 18:13.675
-No, Stuart. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.721
[sighs]

18:19.264 --> 18:21.141
[dialing]

18:21.225 --> 18:23.560
-[BoJack] <i>What?</i>
<i>-</i>Hey, BoJack, great news!

18:23.644 --> 18:25.896
-Bad time. Can't talk.
-Wait, just listen for a...

18:25.979 --> 18:27.147
-[dial tone]
-[sighs]

18:30.275 --> 18:31.610
Okay.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.364
Here we go, baby.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.246
Oh, man!
You are not finding what you need!

18:42.329 --> 18:45.624
The deck is a harsh mistress, Tina.
Hollyhock, you gotta get in here!

18:45.707 --> 18:48.669
Tina is drawing so many cards.
It's amazing.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.088
Hollyhock! Hollyhock?

18:51.171 --> 18:53.215
-[body thuds in distance]
-Hollyhock?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.424
[woman] That's her name?

18:54.508 --> 18:56.593
Yes, for the third time,
her name is "Hollyhock."

18:56.677 --> 18:57.719
And her last name?

18:57.803 --> 19:01.098
Manheim-Mannheim, uh, Steamroller...

19:01.181 --> 19:02.349
Is there more?

19:02.432 --> 19:04.643
I think there's a Lopez
in the mix somewhere?

19:04.726 --> 19:05.978
A Chung maybe?

19:06.061 --> 19:08.021
I'm sorry, sir, I can't help you.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.566
Okay, just... any information
you can give me

19:10.649 --> 19:12.943
on the 17-year-old horse girl
who came here by ambulance

19:13.026 --> 19:15.112
15 minutes ago would be
of interest to my friend,

19:15.195 --> 19:17.781
Mr. Franklin's... friend, Mr. Hamilton.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.284
If you can't prove you're
her parent or legal guardian,

19:20.367 --> 19:22.077
I can't release any information to you.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.203
-Guerrero!
-What?

19:23.287 --> 19:26.081
Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...
Robinson...

19:26.165 --> 19:29.168
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack.
That's her name.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.294
And she's about five-eight.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.129
And she's 17,
her birthday is in September.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.173
And... she looks like me.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.133
And she loves apples
but hates apple sauce.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.259
And she's funny.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.388
But she isn't mean.
Which is pretty remarkable,

19:41.471 --> 19:44.141
'cause a lot of 17-year-olds think
you have to be mean to be funny,

19:44.224 --> 19:46.894
but Hollyhock is very sweet,

19:46.977 --> 19:48.270
even if she can be sarcastic.

19:48.353 --> 19:52.024
But she has this smile with...

19:52.107 --> 19:53.192
Does that help?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.485
No, man.
Are you her legal guardian?

19:55.569 --> 19:57.571
I'm not leaving here
until I get to see her.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.364
-Have a seat.
-[groans]

19:59.448 --> 20:01.742
<i>Well, I don't like</i>
<i>pedophile murderer hands,</i>

20:01.825 --> 20:05.120
<i>but I also don't like people</i>
<i>talking trash about avocados.</i>

20:05.204 --> 20:07.706
<i>-This is a real head-scratcher for me.</i>
-[groans]

20:07.789 --> 20:11.335
<i>I mean, what's next?</i>
<i>The grief for every meal...</i>

20:11.418 --> 20:13.337
-[man] She'll be fine.
-Huh?

20:13.420 --> 20:15.088
We have to think
what's best for Hollyhock.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.216
-Hollyhock is going to be okay.
-Excuse me.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.842
Did you say Hollyhock? Are you...

20:18.926 --> 20:20.135
Jose Guerrero.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.930
Hello, yes! Yeah. Thank God you're here.
I'm BoJack Horseman.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.224
Yeah, we know.
I'm her dad, Steve Mannheim.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.808
I'm the wrong Mannheim to mess with.

20:26.892 --> 20:27.935
I'm Dashawn Manheim.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.811
I'm probably
the right Manheim to mess with,

20:29.895 --> 20:32.814
unless we're talking about
a dance battle, in which case...

20:32.898 --> 20:35.859
Five, six, seven, eight. Ha!

20:35.943 --> 20:38.320
-You've been warned.
-Okay. Yep.

20:38.403 --> 20:41.365
Cupe Robinson III.
I think you're just ghastly,

20:41.448 --> 20:43.909
and I was against
this whole caper from the bell.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.535
-Okay.
-Otto Zilberschlag.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.621
Uh, formerly a huge fan.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.623
-Now... just a regular fan.
-Got it.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.875
I know <i>of</i> you,
but not through your work.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.418
-Okay.
-I'm Gregory Hsung.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.213
I only watch foreign films.
That's my deal.

20:56.296 --> 21:02.219
Arturo Fonzarelli, but I'm pretty cool
so people call me the "Ice Man."

21:02.302 --> 21:03.887
And I'm Quackers!

21:03.971 --> 21:05.764
-Quack, quack, quack!
-Easy, Quackers.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.849
How's Hollyhock?
They wouldn't give me information.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.978
-Why would they? You're not her dad.
-No, I know. I just... Is she okay?

21:11.061 --> 21:13.438
She will be.
The doctor said she's lucky to be alive.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.606
What happened?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.358
-She overdosed.
-What? No.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.902
How could you let this happen?
Quack, quack!

21:18.986 --> 21:22.072
-Quackers! Settle down.
-What was she on? I had no idea.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.240
You had no idea?

21:23.323 --> 21:25.409
Have you looked at her?
She's as thin as a pole.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.203
You know I don't care
for your Polish jokes, Dashawn.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.330
She told us you were
taking care of her.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.165
-I was.
-I knew she was too young

21:32.249 --> 21:33.542
to be on her own like this.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.710
She's a child!

21:34.793 --> 21:38.338
She called Pedro Almod√≥var's
<i>I'm So Excited</i> "excessively kitsch."

21:38.422 --> 21:42.718
-Kitsch <i>is</i> excessive! That's the point!
-Can I see her? Can I talk to her?

21:42.801 --> 21:44.970
-You're lucky we don't call the police!
-Quack, quack.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.889
Our kid got hooked on amphetamines
because of you!

21:47.973 --> 21:49.766
-No, I didn't...
-Quack, quack, quack, quack.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.728
Okay, I feel like there's a lot
of male energy right now.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.646
Why don't I come back in a couple hours?

21:54.730 --> 21:56.898
Give Hollyhock a chance to rest
before I talk to her.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.360
Are you insane?
You are never seeing Hollyhock again.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.737
-Look, if I could just...
-Never.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.534
[whimpers]

22:08.952 --> 22:11.163
[muffled audio]

22:11.913 --> 22:13.707
-I have four grapefruits.
-[panting] Okay.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.375
Henrietta, would you like a grapefruit?

22:15.459 --> 22:17.794
I have but four,
but I will share one with you,

22:17.878 --> 22:19.629
for I am kind and honest.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.090
[normal audio] No, no. No, no, no.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.428
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.180
[gasping]

22:28.263 --> 22:30.557
[panting]

22:38.940 --> 22:40.859
-Where's the girl?
-She's gone, Mom.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.612
Oh, yes, I took her, didn't I?
Where did I put her?

22:43.695 --> 22:46.364
Oh, Henrietta,
would you help me pack this?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.784
-I want to bring it to my son.
-Thanks, Mom.

22:48.867 --> 22:53.622
-It's for my son.
-Right. How did I not see it?

22:53.705 --> 22:56.333
All this time, I thought
you were a terrible parent.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.377
And you were.
But I blew it even worse.

22:59.461 --> 23:04.132
It turns out being a parent is impossible,
so I guess I can't be that mad at you.

23:04.216 --> 23:08.220
Mad at me? No, Henrietta,
this is the right thing. You'll see.

23:08.303 --> 23:09.763
Maybe we deserve each other.

23:09.846 --> 23:12.349
Where is the girl?
I made the girl coffee.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.559
Jesus, you two and your coffee.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.937
Wait. No.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.605
-[panting]
-Oh!

23:18.688 --> 23:20.023
What did you put in this?

23:20.107 --> 23:22.442
That's an old family secret.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.574
"Chub-B-Gone?"

23:29.658 --> 23:32.327
-Takes the pounds right off.
-This whole time.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.538
Just until she learned to take it herself.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.331
-Of course it was you.
-Henrietta!

23:36.414 --> 23:38.208
No. All this "I-don't-know-where-I-am

23:38.291 --> 23:41.711
or-who-my-son-stuff" is,
is officially not cute anymore.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.547
You ruined the one good thing I had.

23:43.630 --> 23:47.050
The one thing I didn't ruin myself,
but of course I did

23:47.134 --> 23:50.011
because I thought it was a good idea
to give you one more chance.

23:50.095 --> 23:54.307
-Where is Crackerjack?
-Stop. You are out of chances.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.184
[dance music on radio]

24:11.408 --> 24:14.411
No, I said "worst available room."

24:17.414 --> 24:19.249
FYI, we keep these blinds down

24:19.332 --> 24:21.126
because the window looks out
at a Dumpster.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.711
-Noted.
-You know...

24:22.794 --> 24:24.421
you kick me a little coin right now,

24:24.504 --> 24:27.132
I can make sure your mother
is very well taken care of.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.677
Oh! In that case, please watch me
not reach for my wallet.

24:32.846 --> 24:37.017
Well, this is your life now.
This is what it all added up to.
