02:15.920 --> 02:20.961
This is the borderland that lies between
the countries of Egypt and Israel.

02:21.091 --> 02:26.512
As it is today, so it was 1,000 years
before the birth of Jesus of Nazareth.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.683
Even then, these boundaries
were kept ablaze

02:29.808 --> 02:32.644
with the fires of hatred and conflict.

02:32.770 --> 02:36.768
Each side prided themselves
on the efficiency of their spies

02:36.899 --> 02:39.983
but kept themselves
always on the alert.

02:40.486 --> 02:47.235
Soldiers of David, commanded by his
son and heir Adonijah, prince of Israel.

02:53.541 --> 02:58.333
- A chariot moving along the road.
- Stop the fool, whoever he is.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.094
- Prince Solomon.
- Is my brother here?

03:13.227 --> 03:16.560
Prince Adonijah is at the top of the hill.
Follow me.

03:31.161 --> 03:34.162
Solomon! What are you doing here?

03:34.290 --> 03:38.501
On my way to Jerusalem, we got word
the Egyptians were on the prowl again.

03:38.627 --> 03:40.501
I thought you might need some help.

03:40.629 --> 03:44.497
You are better suited to singing songs
than exploits in battle.

03:44.633 --> 03:49.628
Our father David was a singer of songs,
but he's also a mighty warrior.

03:54.643 --> 03:57.847
- Where are the Egyptians?
- They thought to trap me,

03:57.980 --> 04:03.271
to rush in on our camp and kill us
while we slept, but we're not sleeping.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.927
Give me your orders.

04:32.056 --> 04:34.179
This is not your kind of game, brother.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.179
I never thought of it as a game.
I fight by your side.

04:37.311 --> 04:41.640
- Then the sword of victory, Solomon.
- And the shield of God, Adonijah.

04:49.573 --> 04:51.945
Spread out, and kill them all.

05:29.071 --> 05:30.862
- Now we attack.
- Attack.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.451
Sound the retreat.

07:48.919 --> 07:53.628
Once again, the Pharaoh will have reason
to remember the name of Adonijah.

07:53.757 --> 07:56.083
Let him write it in the blood of his dead.

07:56.218 --> 07:59.421
Too long
this soil has been bathed in blood.

07:59.555 --> 08:02.805
Have you lost your taste for blood
now that the battle is over?

08:02.933 --> 08:05.009
After seeing the glory of victory,

08:05.144 --> 08:07.433
the glory of peace makes itself known.

08:07.563 --> 08:10.599
Peace is for women and children.

08:10.733 --> 08:14.647
Let me cleanse my mouth
of the stench of the Egyptians.

08:14.778 --> 08:17.614
To a new victory
won by the Prince of Israel.

08:17.740 --> 08:20.610
- To the warrior prince, Adonijah.
- To Adonijah.

08:20.743 --> 08:24.443
To your glory, brother.
May it increase the glory of Israel.

08:24.580 --> 08:29.621
There would be greater glory if I were
not shackled by command of my father.

08:29.752 --> 08:32.124
Defend but never attack.

08:32.254 --> 08:36.501
When I am king, there will be no
privileged sanctuaries for my enemies.

08:36.634 --> 08:38.958
I'll pursue them into their own cities.

08:39.094 --> 08:43.554
- We'll hunt them down like dogs.
- We'll rout them out.

08:43.682 --> 08:47.550
Highness, this one was found
among the dead, but he is no Egyptian.

08:47.686 --> 08:49.726
Put him down.

08:53.150 --> 08:56.566
The Pharaoh has mercenaries,
but I have never seen one like him.

08:56.695 --> 09:00.527
- From where do you come?
- I have the honour to serve Her Majesty.

09:00.658 --> 09:04.157
- The Queen of Sheba.
- The Queen of Sheba?

09:04.286 --> 09:07.287
We're a long way from the land of Sheba.
800 leagues.

09:07.414 --> 09:11.495
Where goes the Queen of Sheba
there go I, a soldier of her guard.

09:11.627 --> 09:14.663
Why does a Sheban
fight with Egyptians against Israel?

09:14.797 --> 09:16.624
I fight where my queen commands.

09:16.757 --> 09:23.294
And it pleased my queen to lead
her troops against a band of barbarians.

09:23.430 --> 09:27.642
I'll send your hide to this brave queen
of yours as a token of my esteem.

09:27.768 --> 09:32.347
No. Grant him the respect
one soldier should have for another.

09:32.481 --> 09:34.390
Bind up his wounds.

09:36.068 --> 09:38.108
So spare him.

09:41.657 --> 09:45.406
Out of regard for the tender heart
of my dear brother.

09:45.536 --> 09:48.905
This queen amuses herself
by leading men across our borders

09:49.039 --> 09:51.661
to slay Israelites
as she might attend a circus.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.544
I doubt if she found
much amusement here.

09:59.550 --> 10:01.589
Hezrai.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.926
What brings the king's chancellor here?
More orders?

10:10.060 --> 10:15.268
No, Highness. If that were so,
mine would be a far happier mission.

10:16.609 --> 10:19.563
Your father, King David,
lies at the point of death.

10:19.695 --> 10:23.029
He lapsed into a coma
and has not regained consciousness.

10:23.157 --> 10:26.360
His physicians could give me
no word of hope to bring you.

10:26.493 --> 10:29.945
Josiah, we ride to Jerusalem.

10:30.080 --> 10:35.157
- Hail Adonijah, King of Israel.
- Hail Adonijah. Hail the king.

10:35.294 --> 10:39.707
It is not your right to proclaim the king.
These are the words of the Law:

10:39.840 --> 10:42.165
"He shall be anointed
with the waters of Gihon

10:42.301 --> 10:45.966
and crowned in the presence of the
priest and the elders of the tribes."

10:46.096 --> 10:49.679
Your law may be the Word, Chancellor.
Mine is the sword.

10:49.808 --> 10:51.848
Hail Adonijah.

10:54.230 --> 10:58.441
And why do you remain silent?
Am I not David's rightful heir?

10:58.567 --> 11:02.897
- Your first thought is not for our father?
- Life is for the living.

11:03.489 --> 11:08.827
When I know David is no longer living,
I will be the first to acknowledge you.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.665
I will follow you, Highness.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.376
We could reach Jerusalem
by dawn tomorrow.

11:27.513 --> 11:32.091
Let Solomon concern himself with
the dead. My thoughts are for the living.

11:32.226 --> 11:36.306
I have business with this Sheban queen.

11:36.438 --> 11:39.309
We must ride fast to overtake her.

11:40.818 --> 11:42.360
Horses!

12:13.726 --> 12:15.932
Hai! Hai!

12:16.061 --> 12:18.517
Hai! Go!

12:35.664 --> 12:38.499
Go! Go!

12:48.552 --> 12:50.592
Halt!

12:54.058 --> 12:56.097
Stand aside.

13:03.692 --> 13:06.266
In Israel, I give the orders.

13:06.820 --> 13:11.198
I regret that we did not meet last night
when you visited my encampment.

13:11.325 --> 13:12.784
Who are you?

13:14.620 --> 13:16.659
- The king of Israel.
- He lies.

13:16.789 --> 13:18.616
Whoever he is, he is an impostor.

13:18.749 --> 13:21.916
The king is an old man,
weak with the burden of his years.

13:22.044 --> 13:26.042
Is that why you thought it safe
to join forces with the Egyptians?

13:26.173 --> 13:29.258
Give me leave,
and I will clear them from the road.

13:29.385 --> 13:34.343
You think you could do better now
than you did last night?

13:34.473 --> 13:39.100
David lies dead in Jerusalem.
I, Adonijah, am his heir.

13:39.228 --> 13:43.890
- We want no dealings with the Israelites.
- Let him speak, Baltor.

13:44.024 --> 13:48.069
- What favour do you seek of me?
- If we were dealing in favours,

13:48.195 --> 13:51.066
- I could bring you the heads of your dead.
- Kill him!

13:51.198 --> 13:54.448
- Your own head is not too secure.
- Silence, Haran.

13:54.577 --> 13:58.526
I pursued you not to ask favours
but to grant them.

13:58.664 --> 14:02.614
And what favour could an Israelite
grant the Queen of Sheba?

14:02.751 --> 14:05.587
A kingdom twice as large
as she now rules.

14:05.713 --> 14:11.336
Renounce your alliance with the Pharaoh.
Let your banners fly beside mine.

14:11.468 --> 14:16.759
When I have overthrown him, I will give
you all his lands that border on your own.

14:17.558 --> 14:20.227
And if I refuse your generosity?

14:21.312 --> 14:25.724
Then I will hurl you down into
the same dust that will choke the Pharaoh.

14:25.858 --> 14:30.235
Yours is the choice.
Glory with Israel, or disaster with Egypt.

14:31.197 --> 14:33.236
You dog!

14:33.365 --> 14:36.283
My ancestors sat upon
the throne of a great country

14:36.410 --> 14:41.037
when yours still crawled on their hands
and knees, feeding on insects.

14:41.165 --> 14:44.664
- Is that your answer?
- This is my answer.

14:49.673 --> 14:51.251
Haran!

14:56.096 --> 14:57.721
Hail the king of Israel!

15:52.361 --> 15:54.401
Solomon.

15:56.615 --> 15:59.616
- Am I in time, Abishag?
- He still lives.

15:59.743 --> 16:02.579
Your mother and I have been
constantly by his side.

16:02.705 --> 16:06.619
- We must have hope.
- My prayers have been answered.

16:06.750 --> 16:10.795
That you are here while your father
is able to give you his blessing.

16:10.921 --> 16:12.878
- Mother.
- My son.

16:13.966 --> 16:16.006
My son.

16:17.219 --> 16:19.259
Do not despair.

16:34.195 --> 16:38.026
- Is there hope?
- His heart still beats,

16:38.157 --> 16:43.827
but his breath is so quenched
that it leaves no mist upon the metal.

16:46.123 --> 16:48.661
My father. My king.

16:50.377 --> 16:54.292
Let my prayers call you back
from the shadows.

17:01.972 --> 17:06.598
Solomon, peace of the Lord.

17:06.727 --> 17:10.724
In my dream,
your face was ever before me.

17:11.523 --> 17:13.563
Now I am here, Father.

17:14.859 --> 17:19.606
- Where is your brother?
- Adonijah was detained with his troops.

17:19.740 --> 17:23.785
Ever the soldier, before all else.

17:23.911 --> 17:27.742
Send messages
with my command that he return.

17:27.873 --> 17:30.115
It will be done.

17:31.418 --> 17:35.084
Now rest until your strength returns.

17:35.214 --> 17:39.627
- Bring me Nathan the prophet.
- I am here, O King.

17:39.760 --> 17:44.802
Summon the elders of the 12 tribes
and the council.

17:44.932 --> 17:47.257
I have had a vision from God.

18:26.223 --> 18:30.435
You've been summoned at the king's
command. Hear the words of the king.

18:30.561 --> 18:34.772
Has there been no report
from the couriers sent to bring Adonijah?

18:34.899 --> 18:37.105
No, sire, none have returned.

18:38.110 --> 18:40.435
Then I must act without him.

18:43.032 --> 18:46.116
40 years I have reigned over you,

18:46.243 --> 18:50.193
and I have been your father
and you my beloved children.

18:50.331 --> 18:53.782
Excepting the memory of me
which will live in your hearts,

18:54.543 --> 19:01.127
I leave but one monument to my name:
The unity of Israel.

19:01.258 --> 19:07.213
Symbol of the 12 tribes, once separate,
each striving for dominance,

19:07.348 --> 19:12.769
but now you, the elders of the tribes,
stand before me, banded together,

19:12.895 --> 19:15.018
in an indestructible oneness.

19:15.814 --> 19:20.026
You were the last to lead your tribe
into the union, Ahab.

19:21.028 --> 19:27.944
And as a pledge of your loyalty,
you brought me your only child, Abishag.

19:30.079 --> 19:33.530
I have loved and cherished her
as my own daughter,

19:33.666 --> 19:36.417
as I have loved and cherished Israel,

19:36.544 --> 19:40.126
of which she has become
the living symbol.

19:42.341 --> 19:45.425
She has been an honour to my house.

19:46.262 --> 19:49.049
And to the household of David.

19:49.181 --> 19:52.384
My day is almost done.

19:52.518 --> 19:56.302
But the day of Israel has hardly dawned.

19:56.438 --> 20:00.982
It is well that I make room for another
to follow after me on this throne.

20:01.110 --> 20:03.149
No, you stay the king.

20:03.279 --> 20:04.689
No! No!

20:04.822 --> 20:08.570
- His Highness, Prince Adonijah.
- Adonijah?

20:08.701 --> 20:12.319
Sire, I have driven like a fury
to attend this council

20:12.454 --> 20:15.539
ever since your command reached me.

20:18.836 --> 20:21.837
Behold the two halves of me.

20:21.964 --> 20:24.004
The soldier.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.375
And the poet.

20:28.137 --> 20:30.592
I have loved you both dearly.

20:32.016 --> 20:33.843
Tell me.

20:33.976 --> 20:38.104
- Is there any jealousy between you?
- No, sire.

20:38.230 --> 20:43.355
Jealousy of what? Have I a desire
to distinguish myself as a scholar?

20:43.485 --> 20:47.898
It is Adonijah's destiny to rule,
and I will truly serve him.

20:48.032 --> 20:52.610
It is God who decrees
the destinies of his creatures, my son.

20:52.745 --> 20:55.033
As I lay close to death,

20:55.164 --> 20:59.078
out of the darkness
a great voice called to me and said

20:59.210 --> 21:03.539
"I am the Lord thy God,
who placed thee upon the throne."

21:04.465 --> 21:07.300
"And this I declare unto you:

21:07.426 --> 21:14.473
Only in peace can Israel prosper
and be made great, not in strife."

21:15.851 --> 21:20.846
And again, the Lord God Jehovah
spoke to his servant David:

21:21.565 --> 21:27.235
"Behold, a son has been born unto thee,
a man of peace."

21:27.363 --> 21:31.063
"Wherefore,
thou hast named him Solomon."

21:33.327 --> 21:36.862
"And I will establish
his kingdom for ever."

21:39.083 --> 21:41.538
- The kingdom is mine!
- God wills it otherwise.

21:41.669 --> 21:44.623
You made good use
of your time alone with him.

21:44.755 --> 21:46.878
You used his weakness against me.

21:47.007 --> 21:48.917
- I knew nothing of this.
- You lie.

21:49.051 --> 21:52.385
- You were always a weaver of words.
- You accuse him falsely.

21:52.513 --> 21:56.641
After you've chosen him over me?
Theirs should be the choice.

21:56.767 --> 21:59.056
- Let them choose.
- Aye, hear us.

21:59.186 --> 22:01.095
- Adonijah.
- Adonijah.

22:01.230 --> 22:04.813
- You, the elders, what say you?
- Accept the will of God.

22:04.942 --> 22:08.774
- The crown is mine. I shall fight for it.
- Adonijah is the rightful heir.

22:08.904 --> 22:12.688
Act not with violence
lest the wrath of God fall upon you.

22:12.825 --> 22:15.150
I have never done anything
to deprive you.

22:15.286 --> 22:17.574
Words from the mouth of a hypocrite.

22:17.705 --> 22:21.489
Isn't yours the act of a hypocrite
in coming to greet your father?

22:21.625 --> 22:25.374
You who proclaimed yourself king
even though you knew David lived.

22:27.256 --> 22:29.249
Has Hezrai spoken truly?

22:29.383 --> 22:32.384
I did not know that
you had sent him to spy on me.

22:32.511 --> 22:35.346
Could you not wait
until the breath left my body?

22:35.472 --> 22:40.134
- I am weary with waiting.
- The king must respect and obey the law.

22:40.269 --> 22:44.349
In proclaiming yourself,
you have violated the law of God and man.

22:44.481 --> 22:50.021
I claimed what was mine by right,
and I shall never relinquish that right.

22:50.154 --> 22:53.357
How long will it take them
to discover his incompetence?

22:53.490 --> 22:55.816
Solomon king? Lmpossible.

22:55.951 --> 23:00.578
Now it is revealed
out of the mouth of Adonijah himself

23:00.706 --> 23:03.078
why God hath turned his face from him.

23:03.209 --> 23:06.743
The wisdom of God
passeth all understanding.

23:06.879 --> 23:10.544
As it is written, so let it be done.

23:10.674 --> 23:12.881
Bring forth the waters of Gihon

23:13.010 --> 23:15.548
and here, as God commands,

23:15.679 --> 23:19.262
anoint Solomon king of Israel.

23:21.018 --> 23:23.723
- By the grace of God.
- By the grace of God.

23:23.854 --> 23:27.686
Yield, Adonijah. Yield
and bend the knee in the name of God.

23:27.816 --> 23:30.486
Never! Rather would I
bend knee to the Pharaoh

23:30.611 --> 23:34.194
than to this brother
who has robbed me of my birthright!

23:36.992 --> 23:41.120
Then hold high the tablet of unity
before his eyes

23:41.247 --> 23:46.371
so that he may ever remember
the purpose of his consecration.

23:56.595 --> 23:59.217
Hail Solomon,

23:59.348 --> 24:03.761
by the grace of God, king of Israel.

24:03.894 --> 24:10.348
Hail Solomon,
by the grace of God, king of Israel.

24:14.071 --> 24:18.116
Turn not against thy brother, Solomon.

24:18.242 --> 24:21.445
His blood is hot, but it will cool.

24:21.579 --> 24:23.702
You have my pledge, sire.

24:23.831 --> 24:27.449
I will never forget that he is my brother.

24:27.585 --> 24:32.496
And you, my child,
will you remain in the king's household,

24:33.591 --> 24:37.458
or will you return to Gilead
with your father Ahab?

24:37.595 --> 24:42.553
When I was brought to the house of David,
my people sang songs of gladness,

24:42.683 --> 24:45.139
and I came with joy in my heart.

24:45.269 --> 24:50.690
With the same joy, I will remain
within the house of Solomon.

24:51.525 --> 24:56.271
One thing remains heavy on my heart.

24:57.615 --> 25:02.526
In my youth, I dreamed
that I would build a mighty temple

25:02.661 --> 25:05.413
to house the Ark of the Covenant.

25:06.081 --> 25:08.833
But I sinned greatly,

25:08.959 --> 25:14.120
and was not fit to erect
the habitation of the Lord.

25:14.256 --> 25:17.174
Redeem my vow, my son.

25:17.301 --> 25:22.924
Pledge me that you will build
the great temple of which I had dreamed

25:23.057 --> 25:28.929
so that God will have his dwelling place
among his people.

25:29.063 --> 25:31.305
I promise you it shall be built.

25:33.067 --> 25:36.732
Be strong and of good courage.

25:38.614 --> 25:41.152
Dread not,

25:41.283 --> 25:43.739
nor be dismayed.

26:27.454 --> 26:29.992
O Lord, my God,

26:30.124 --> 26:35.628
thou hast made thy servant king
instead of David, my father,

26:35.754 --> 26:38.459
and I am no more than a little child.

26:39.675 --> 26:45.049
Give therefore unto thy servant
an understanding heart

26:45.181 --> 26:48.051
that I may judge thy people,

26:48.184 --> 26:51.599
that I may discern between good and evil,

26:51.729 --> 26:57.767
for who is able to judge this,
thy so great a people?

27:02.031 --> 27:04.985
Because thou hast asked this thing

27:05.117 --> 27:10.075
and hast not asked for thyself
long life, nor riches for thyself,

27:10.206 --> 27:12.743
nor the life of thine enemies,

27:12.875 --> 27:17.038
but hast asked for understanding
to discern judgement.

27:17.171 --> 27:20.871
Behold, I have done
according to thy words.

27:21.008 --> 27:26.797
I have given unto thee
a wise and understanding heart.

27:26.931 --> 27:29.600
And if thou wilt walk in my ways,

27:29.725 --> 27:32.975
keeping my statutes
and my commandments,

27:33.103 --> 27:36.804
I will give unto thee
both riches and honour

27:36.941 --> 27:41.437
so there shall not be
among the kings of the earth

27:41.570 --> 27:45.948
any like unto thee in all thy days.

28:03.926 --> 28:05.965
- Not good enough.
- No?

28:12.476 --> 28:15.726
With you, I am seldom good enough.
Double the wager.

28:15.855 --> 28:17.894
Very well.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.151
I should have killed him
when he was chosen king.

28:22.278 --> 28:24.603
Patience, Highness. Wait.

28:25.948 --> 28:29.531
- I am not a patient man.
- I am aware of that.

28:40.462 --> 28:42.585
Leave us, Joab.

28:42.715 --> 28:47.258
Did you not hear His Majesty, Joab?
Obey his command.

28:49.555 --> 28:52.675
For a man whose wisdom
is becoming the marvel of the land,

28:52.808 --> 28:55.809
you show a surprising lack of it
by coming here alone.

28:55.936 --> 28:58.474
I have come to ask a favour of you.

28:59.565 --> 29:04.274
Knowing that this hand of mine must ache
to drive this spear through your body?

29:04.403 --> 29:06.561
I know what is in your heart.

29:06.697 --> 29:12.071
All I ask is that you love your country
as much as you hate me.

29:12.203 --> 29:16.247
That would make me the greatest patriot
in the history of Israel.

29:16.373 --> 29:18.532
David has laid a great burden upon me.

29:18.667 --> 29:23.744
To rule the kingdom and to build the
temple, both of which I have undertaken.

29:23.881 --> 29:27.166
But you have elected
to remain here in your lodge,

29:27.301 --> 29:31.678
depriving the people of your great talent
as a soldier and a commander.

29:31.805 --> 29:33.715
To build is not enough.

29:33.849 --> 29:38.558
What has been built must be defended
against all the enemies of the nation.

29:39.396 --> 29:42.350
For that task,
you are far better suited than I.

29:43.108 --> 29:44.852
Return to Jerusalem,

29:44.985 --> 29:49.980
offer your services, not to me,
but to your country and your God.

29:50.699 --> 29:53.155
You are offering me
command of the army?

29:53.285 --> 29:54.281
Yes.

29:54.411 --> 29:56.985
Even though I might try
to use it against you?

29:57.122 --> 29:59.162
Yes.

30:04.547 --> 30:06.290
Well?

30:07.466 --> 30:11.760
I am trying to decide
if you are the wisest of the wise,

30:11.887 --> 30:13.927
or the fool of fools.

30:32.116 --> 30:35.366
So Solomon walked
in the way of his God,

30:35.494 --> 30:40.737
and through a long era of peace,
Israel grew and prospered.

31:02.938 --> 31:05.264
With the completion of the temple,

31:05.399 --> 31:10.357
Solomon had fulfilled
a most sacred pledge to his father.

31:25.002 --> 31:28.288
Solomon, king over Israel.

31:43.521 --> 31:47.565
Lord God of Israel,
there is no god like thee.

31:48.567 --> 31:51.354
Heaven of heavens cannot contain thee,

31:51.487 --> 31:56.279
how much less this house
that I have builded unto thy name?

31:56.408 --> 31:59.991
Yet hear thy servant and his supplication,

32:00.120 --> 32:05.910
and let thy word be verified
which thou spakest unto my father David.

32:06.752 --> 32:13.205
And of thy people Israel,
when they shall pray towards this place,

32:13.342 --> 32:17.885
hear thou in heaven,
and when thou hearest, forgive.

32:19.390 --> 32:24.135
For they be thy people
as this house is thine,

32:24.270 --> 32:28.054
that all the earth may know
the Lord is God.

32:30.276 --> 32:32.315
There is none else.

32:32.444 --> 32:39.194
Amen.

32:49.837 --> 32:52.589
Come. Come.

32:52.715 --> 32:54.754
Come...

32:55.634 --> 32:57.426
Come...

32:57.553 --> 33:00.044
Oh, Majesty!

33:01.599 --> 33:06.095
Come and join us, Baltor.
I am teaching my bird to obey.

33:06.228 --> 33:09.229
Takyan disapproves. I need an ally.

33:09.356 --> 33:13.021
That is exactly what the Pharaoh
is complaining about.

33:13.152 --> 33:17.102
The Pharaoh is complaining?
We will have to teach him.

33:17.239 --> 33:20.324
Another message
has just arrived from Egypt.

33:20.451 --> 33:23.654
- Let it wait.
- But it is a serious matter.

33:23.787 --> 33:27.868
The Pharaoh has called a conference
of all the kings.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.203
Sit down, Baltor.
You make Tokki nervous.

33:36.592 --> 33:38.466
A deeper shade, Takyan.

33:39.345 --> 33:42.595
Pomegranate. That is the right colour.

33:44.308 --> 33:46.348
Well, Baltor?

33:46.477 --> 33:48.600
What is the problem this time?

33:48.729 --> 33:51.137
Your Majesty,
the problem is the Israelites.

33:51.273 --> 33:55.520
They proclaim peace yet strengthen
their army, and for what purpose?

33:55.653 --> 33:58.357
They are afraid of the Pharaoh, perhaps.

33:58.489 --> 34:00.695
What have we to fear?

34:00.824 --> 34:06.863
In spite of our eternal hatred,
we now have friendly relations with Israel.

34:06.997 --> 34:09.619
True, but our security is threatened.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.119
Almost fanatically
they support their great King Solomon.

34:13.254 --> 34:16.670
A dreamer. A man of peace.

34:16.799 --> 34:21.793
But a man of ideas, and there is nothing
more dangerous than a man with an idea.

34:24.306 --> 34:26.976
- The threat is real?
- Very real.

34:27.101 --> 34:29.971
Solomon's threat
is not only his army, but his god.

34:30.103 --> 34:33.437
His god? We have a hundred gods.

34:33.565 --> 34:39.983
This is one god who teaches that
all men are equal and none are slaves.

34:40.114 --> 34:42.438
What a foolish idea.

34:44.201 --> 34:50.121
And yet... if that idea
were to take hold of the people,

34:50.248 --> 34:55.326
the Queen of Sheba would soon
come crashing down from her throne.

34:55.462 --> 34:58.167
As would all other absolute monarchs.

34:58.299 --> 35:02.427
Therefore I strongly advise
Your Majesty to attend this conference.

35:02.553 --> 35:07.547
You see, Baltor?
To catch the bird, first bait the trap.

35:09.143 --> 35:13.520
Perhaps we can help the Pharaoh
solve the problem of Solomon,

35:13.647 --> 35:17.063
and kill two birds with one stone.

35:28.204 --> 35:33.328
Since Solomon came to the throne of
Israel, I've watched his strength grow

35:33.459 --> 35:36.875
until now his power
has become a threat to my borders.

35:37.004 --> 35:41.962
And the wealth and trade which once
came to us now finds its way to him.

35:42.092 --> 35:45.212
For too long we have delayed
plans for his destruction.

35:45.346 --> 35:49.260
- Yes, take up arms against him.
- Raise a great host.

35:49.391 --> 35:52.558
- Trample Israel into the dust.
- King Eglon.

35:52.686 --> 35:55.972
- From Moab, I want 1,000 chariots.
- I will send you 2,000.

35:56.106 --> 36:00.151
Kaldu, from Chaldea
you will send me 5,000 archers.

36:00.277 --> 36:04.655
- More if they are needed.
- We will attack exactly as I have planned.

36:04.782 --> 36:08.566
From the north, the east and the south,
at the same time, by surprise.

36:08.702 --> 36:11.454
They will not know
how or where to make a defence.

36:11.580 --> 36:16.076
- We will drive them into the sea.
- And Sheba.

36:16.210 --> 36:19.543
What force will you send
against Solomon?

36:19.672 --> 36:21.711
None.

36:23.717 --> 36:26.387
Why? Are you not my ally?

36:26.512 --> 36:30.379
We must put an end to Israel, and with it
this dangerous idea of one god.

36:30.516 --> 36:35.937
You talk of war. How can you
destroy an idea, a faith,

36:36.063 --> 36:38.601
with the point of your spears?

36:41.277 --> 36:43.400
There is only one way it can be done.

36:43.529 --> 36:47.064
What do you suggest? Have you a plan?

36:47.199 --> 36:49.488
I have.

36:49.618 --> 36:52.572
But for every plan, there is a price.

36:53.664 --> 36:55.906
What do you want this time?

36:58.002 --> 37:02.628
The port of Melish on the Red Sea
in return for the downfall of Solomon.

37:02.756 --> 37:05.508
- That is impossible.
- Melish is my port.

37:05.634 --> 37:09.086
This time you ask for too much, Sheba.

37:09.221 --> 37:14.975
Tell me, what would be
the cost of a war against Israel?

37:15.102 --> 37:16.762
You know very well.

37:16.896 --> 37:20.311
And I offer you a plan almost without cost.

37:25.404 --> 37:28.073
His Majesty hesitates, Baltor.

37:28.199 --> 37:33.240
Perhaps we should return to Sheba
rather than to visit Jerusalem.

37:33.370 --> 37:35.410
Wait.

37:38.375 --> 37:41.163
I grant it.

37:41.295 --> 37:47.001
- And how will you destroy Solomon?
- It is said that Solomon is wise.

37:47.134 --> 37:50.550
But no matter how wise a man may be,

37:50.679 --> 37:54.807
he is still human, with a human weakness.

37:56.602 --> 38:02.806
I will sit at the feet of Solomon
like the wise men who flock to Jerusalem.

38:02.942 --> 38:09.822
And perhaps I will learn
from his own lips the way to destroy him.

38:19.583 --> 38:23.415
Truly, the way of a woman
is beyond our understanding.

38:23.546 --> 38:26.630
The way of a woman is simple, my lord.

38:26.757 --> 38:29.924
It is always to follow
the way of a man.

38:37.685 --> 38:42.845
I shall keep myself informed
of your progress in Jerusalem.

38:55.286 --> 38:58.820
Mother! Come! Look! Mother!

39:43.584 --> 39:45.126
Halt!

39:53.969 --> 39:58.762
My compliments. I am Benaiah,
sent to escort you into Jerusalem.

39:58.891 --> 40:02.591
Greetings.
Her Majesty the Queen of Sheba.

40:06.106 --> 40:10.270
Your Majesty, the king of Israel wishes
me to convey his greetings to you.

40:11.403 --> 40:14.239
Truly, your king has built nobly.

40:14.365 --> 40:18.065
There is no such splendour,
even in Egypt.

40:22.540 --> 40:26.205
And all that for a god he cannot even see.

40:28.170 --> 40:30.210
Forward.

41:03.289 --> 41:07.452
Do you think she will be
as beautiful as we have heard?

41:07.918 --> 41:12.876
This is something I never thought to see,
a pagan welcomed to Israel.

41:13.007 --> 41:17.218
How can a pagan be converted
to the true God unless she knows him?

41:17.344 --> 41:21.045
We must never forget
she is an ally of Egypt.

41:21.182 --> 41:26.472
Because she is an ally of Egypt, we must
show her our unity and our strength.

41:26.604 --> 41:30.933
Let us offer her our friendship
in the hope that we have one less enemy.

41:56.592 --> 41:59.463
She is very beautiful, isn't she?

42:08.687 --> 42:11.143
Your Royal Majesty.

42:11.273 --> 42:17.561
Permit me to present my sovereign,
Her Royal Majesty, the Queen of Sheba.

42:30.125 --> 42:32.616
Israel extends a warm welcome
to Your Majesty.

42:32.753 --> 42:38.376
I am grateful for your permission
to visit your beautiful country.

42:50.354 --> 42:54.648
After so much travelling, you must be
pleased to have reached your destination.

42:54.775 --> 42:58.358
If I had travelled ten times the distance
it would be forgotten

42:58.487 --> 43:01.358
in the face of the marvels I have seen,

43:01.490 --> 43:05.618
and in the splendour
of your city of Jerusalem.

43:05.744 --> 43:09.528
If it pleases you, we can dispense
with ceremony and let you rest.

43:09.665 --> 43:11.741
You are most considerate.

43:11.876 --> 43:15.743
But first, let me offer
a token of my appreciation

43:15.880 --> 43:22.463
for the kindness you have shown
to a stranger within your gates.

43:22.595 --> 43:26.260
- Baltor.
- Haran!

44:15.481 --> 44:19.395
- So many gifts.
- Yes, and brought from so far.

44:19.527 --> 44:21.566
Such riches.

44:36.001 --> 44:40.331
I have no adequate words to express
my thanks and the gratitude of my people.

44:40.464 --> 44:43.418
Along with them, I offer my hand

44:43.551 --> 44:49.174
in the hope that this day will mark
the beginning of a closer friendship

44:49.306 --> 44:51.844
between Israel and Sheba.

44:51.976 --> 44:55.558
That would be
the most welcome gift of all.

45:34.810 --> 45:38.724
Benaiah, do you suppose the land
of the Shebans is always like this?

45:38.856 --> 45:41.525
I would think so, yes.

46:01.754 --> 46:04.708
We must not keep the queen waiting.

46:21.398 --> 46:23.687
Welcome.

46:23.817 --> 46:26.059
A message for your queen.

46:34.078 --> 46:36.117
Her Majesty the Queen.

46:38.582 --> 46:41.287
His Majesty King Solomon
sends his greetings

46:41.418 --> 46:45.001
and has commanded me -
has commanded us -

46:45.130 --> 46:49.211
to inform Your Majesty that in response
to Your Majesty's request

46:49.343 --> 46:52.961
he will be most happy
to receive you in private audience.

46:53.097 --> 46:55.173
He is most gracious.

46:55.307 --> 47:00.053
How thoughtful of the king
to send so charming an envoy.

47:00.187 --> 47:02.559
He doesn't know I'm here.

47:02.690 --> 47:04.433
I was so anxious to come.

47:04.567 --> 47:08.860
Then I am even more pleased. Come in.

47:08.988 --> 47:12.191
You are the first of His Majesty's court
to visit me.

47:12.324 --> 47:15.409
How interesting your encampment is.

47:15.536 --> 47:19.913
Are your people
always so carefree and gay?

47:20.040 --> 47:23.326
We enjoy life and pleasure.

47:23.460 --> 47:26.331
- Don't you?
- Yes, we do.

47:26.463 --> 47:30.413
But we are an austere people.
We tend to be more serious.

47:31.468 --> 47:34.802
And your king. Is he also serious?

47:35.723 --> 47:39.803
King Solomon has a great responsibility.

47:39.935 --> 47:43.636
He must maintain
the unity of our 12 tribes.

47:45.232 --> 47:48.067
It is very important, this unity?

47:48.194 --> 47:52.986
Oh, yes. Without it,
there would be no Israel.

47:57.244 --> 48:01.906
The gods of Sheba.
Mal-Ra, the guardian of destiny.

48:02.041 --> 48:05.042
Kol, god of the sun and stars.

48:05.169 --> 48:07.742
Rama, who sends the rain.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.919
We have many gods.

48:10.049 --> 48:12.207
In Israel, we have one god.

48:13.511 --> 48:16.714
When he fails you,
do you blame him for everything?

48:17.765 --> 48:20.220
He never fails us.

48:20.351 --> 48:24.183
You must find it gratifying
to be so close to your king.

48:24.313 --> 48:26.602
Are you his sister, perhaps?

48:28.943 --> 48:33.521
Sometimes he calls me that.
We have been very close to each other,

48:33.656 --> 48:38.068
ever since I came to live
in the house of his father.

48:38.202 --> 48:40.159
Do you stay long in Israel?

48:42.915 --> 48:45.370
That depends upon your king.

48:46.710 --> 48:49.462
You are charming. Innocent.

48:50.798 --> 48:54.416
And you fulfil all my expectations.

48:58.347 --> 49:00.174
For you.

49:00.307 --> 49:02.845
From the land of Sheba.

49:02.977 --> 49:05.016
A gift from its queen.

49:11.026 --> 49:14.360
This Solomon the Almighty...

49:14.488 --> 49:17.062
Almighty what?

49:17.199 --> 49:21.411
20 men surrounding him,
and he calls it a private audience.

49:21.537 --> 49:26.448
- He has entertained you royally...
- And those state banquets!

49:26.584 --> 49:28.872
I at one end, he at the other.

49:29.003 --> 49:33.665
And in between us,
a lot of sour-faced old men.

49:33.799 --> 49:36.753
Not once have I been with him alone.
Not once.

49:36.886 --> 49:39.258
But we have only been here five days.

49:39.388 --> 49:44.050
This Solomon is more difficult to
approach than the Pharaoh of Egypt.

49:44.185 --> 49:50.389
This great king has time for everything,
except the time for being a man.

50:00.034 --> 50:06.202
Send him to me, Rha-Gon, god of love.

50:06.332 --> 50:09.416
Make me the most desirable of women.

50:09.543 --> 50:12.497
Make my lips sweet as honey,

50:12.630 --> 50:17.339
my skin soft and fragrant
like the petals of a flower.

50:19.094 --> 50:21.134
Give him to me.

50:24.767 --> 50:27.139
I want him at my feet.

50:39.573 --> 50:43.274
Your Majesty has a royal visitor.

50:53.754 --> 50:56.625
Her Majesty and I have met before.

50:58.759 --> 51:00.668
My apologies to Your Majesty.

51:00.803 --> 51:04.753
I regret that I was unable
to be at the reception to welcome you.

51:04.890 --> 51:08.224
Had you been there, it would have
made my welcome complete.

51:08.352 --> 51:13.014
Your Majesty is gracious. Rather different
from the occasion of your last visit.

51:13.148 --> 51:17.360
If I remember rightly,
Your Highness was then a king.

51:17.486 --> 51:22.860
Yes. And as a king, I offered you
an alliance against the Pharaoh.

51:24.743 --> 51:28.444
And my answer was not too kind.

51:28.581 --> 51:30.620
So I remember.

51:30.749 --> 51:34.368
This time I venture to offer you
another alliance.

51:34.503 --> 51:37.540
Do you come as envoy
from the king of Israel?

51:37.673 --> 51:41.042
I come as Adonijah,
rightful heir to the throne of Israel.

51:41.177 --> 51:45.091
An alliance between us could give us
many things we both desire.

51:45.222 --> 51:49.054
Do you want Sheban arms
to help you usurp your brother's throne?

51:49.185 --> 51:50.845
Solomon is the usurper.

51:50.978 --> 51:54.014
Once I am on the throne,
our lands could encircle Egypt,

51:54.148 --> 51:57.517
and all of the kings
would be at our mercy.

52:01.447 --> 52:04.317
Why should I want them at my mercy?

52:04.450 --> 52:07.616
I maintain good relations with the kings.

52:07.745 --> 52:10.781
And King Solomon is my friend.

52:10.915 --> 52:13.584
So how could your offer
possibly interest me?

52:13.709 --> 52:18.205
Has the screaming eagle
been transformed into a cooing dove?

52:18.339 --> 52:22.383
How dull the world would be
if people never changed.

52:22.510 --> 52:25.179
I am wiser, Prince Adonijah.

52:25.304 --> 52:28.590
I no longer do battle with a sword.

52:28.724 --> 52:31.180
That's why I find your visit so disturbing.

52:31.310 --> 52:35.936
I find it difficult to believe that you come
bearing an olive branch of peace.

52:36.065 --> 52:41.142
What else could I bring to King Solomon,
who is a man of peace?

52:46.200 --> 52:51.574
Your Majesty, it is clear
that I waste your time as well as mine.

52:53.999 --> 52:57.084
With Your Majesty's permission...

52:59.797 --> 53:03.130
I think I understood you better
as the screaming eagle.

53:10.391 --> 53:12.430
He is still a dog.

53:19.900 --> 53:21.976
Let the women in judgement
come forward.

53:22.111 --> 53:26.274
Never before has an alien
sat beside our king in judgement.

53:26.407 --> 53:28.732
Her presence profanes all Israel.

53:35.499 --> 53:37.622
Who makes complaint?

53:37.751 --> 53:43.256
My Lord King, this woman Leah and I
dwell within the same house.

53:43.382 --> 53:45.505
I was delivered of a child.

53:45.634 --> 53:50.012
On the third day after I was delivered,
she was delivered also.

53:50.139 --> 53:53.175
There was no one in the house
but we two.

53:53.309 --> 53:58.350
In the night, this woman's child died
because she lay upon it,

53:58.480 --> 54:02.015
wherefore she removed my son
from beside me while I slept

54:02.151 --> 54:04.642
and laid her dead child against my bosom.

54:04.778 --> 54:07.151
- She lies.
- Silence.

54:07.281 --> 54:11.148
And when I rose in the morning
to nurse my child, he was dead.

54:11.285 --> 54:14.239
- Not so, Lord Solomon.
- The truth, Lord King.

54:14.371 --> 54:19.413
For when I looked at the child in my arms,
I knew it was not the son that I did bear.

54:19.543 --> 54:23.588
- It was her own child and none other.
- The living child is mine.

54:23.714 --> 54:28.293
- The dead is yours, the living mine.
- Bring the infant forward.

54:29.720 --> 54:31.547
Josiah.

54:33.557 --> 54:37.637
Place the child on the steps before me
and show him to me.

54:56.705 --> 54:58.828
Draw your sword, Josiah.

55:05.047 --> 55:07.799
Divide the child into two parts.

55:09.301 --> 55:13.465
Give half to the one woman,
half to the other.

55:17.518 --> 55:18.763
No!

55:22.898 --> 55:25.389
If it must be,

55:25.526 --> 55:28.562
give the child to her
that it may not be slain.

55:28.696 --> 55:32.112
Divide it.
It should be neither hers nor mine.

55:54.096 --> 55:57.631
Take your son, mother. He is surely yours.

55:57.766 --> 56:01.432
May the Lord God Jehovah
praise and bless you.

56:02.897 --> 56:08.353
You would rather have surrendered him
to another than to see him harmed.

56:11.071 --> 56:13.360
And take this woman hence

56:13.490 --> 56:18.449
and administer to her
punishment to fit her perjury.

56:18.579 --> 56:20.655
She lies. She lies.

56:20.789 --> 56:23.660
It's not right. The child is mine.

56:23.792 --> 56:25.037
Mine!

56:26.754 --> 56:30.917
Now, at last, I have seen
a judgement of Solomon,

56:31.050 --> 56:33.292
and your wisdom amazes me.

56:34.345 --> 56:39.635
Whatever wisdom has been given me,
it was for the benefit of my people.

56:39.767 --> 56:42.684
Continue to teach me, I beg of you,

56:42.811 --> 56:47.936
so that I may gain a greater insight
into the wonder of your understanding.

56:48.067 --> 56:53.405
It will enable me to become a better
and wiser ruler over my own people.

56:55.032 --> 57:00.868
Real wisdom lies in the ability
to decide between the true and the false.

57:14.593 --> 57:19.054
Can you believe that only four years ago,
all this was barren desert?

57:19.890 --> 57:23.057
You have such a joy
in all you have accomplished.

57:23.185 --> 57:27.349
It is a joy to make the desert bloom
by bringing water from the mountains.

57:27.481 --> 57:30.767
You have made this into a paradise.

57:30.901 --> 57:36.062
The water, the work,
the warmth of the sun have done it, not I.

57:39.285 --> 57:42.570
In the last few days,
I have shown you much of Israel.

57:42.705 --> 57:45.706
But you have not told me
anything of your own country.

57:45.833 --> 57:51.076
At this moment, my own land
seems as distant as the stars.

57:51.213 --> 57:55.425
In my youth, I used to dream of visiting
all the faraway kingdoms of the earth.

57:55.551 --> 58:00.592
And now instead,
the rulers of those countries come to you.

58:00.723 --> 58:03.296
You rule Sheba alone.

58:03.434 --> 58:07.728
From the beginning of time,
only queens have ruled in Sheba.

58:07.855 --> 58:09.894
That is our law.

58:10.941 --> 58:15.437
I would be happy to tell Your Majesty
many things concerning my country

58:15.571 --> 58:17.896
if I were sure it would be
of interest to you.

58:18.032 --> 58:20.155
Why do you say that?

58:20.284 --> 58:23.985
Because after all the times
I have visited you,

58:24.121 --> 58:29.495
you have not returned the compliment
by visiting my encampment.

58:29.627 --> 58:31.251
And me.

58:32.421 --> 58:35.920
Perhaps I was waiting for an invitation.

58:36.050 --> 58:38.089
You promise to accept?

58:40.763 --> 58:42.802
I promise.

59:00.950 --> 59:05.078
I am so happy
that at last you have come to visit me.

59:05.204 --> 59:07.446
My people feel honoured.

59:07.581 --> 59:10.915
It is your guest who feels honoured.

59:11.043 --> 59:13.795
You are not bored
by our primitive pastimes?

59:13.921 --> 59:17.705
No, it interests me
to learn what amuses you.

59:24.849 --> 59:26.888
Enough, Takyan.

59:39.405 --> 59:44.197
If I do not prevent it,
my people would stay and stare at you.

59:44.326 --> 59:46.153
Fabled Solomon.

59:48.080 --> 59:50.120
The way I stare at you?

59:55.504 --> 59:57.829
This is the hour of Rha-Gon.

59:57.965 --> 01:00:01.464
Every evening, I make an offering to him.

01:00:06.599 --> 01:00:11.059
Rha-Gon, giver of life, god of love,

01:00:11.187 --> 01:00:15.315
accept this token of my gratitude
and devotion.

01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:36.919
The Feast of Rha-Gon
is the most sacred rite

01:00:37.046 --> 01:00:40.628
celebrated each year in the land of Sheba.

01:00:43.177 --> 01:00:45.929
But tonight let there be no talk of gods.

01:00:46.055 --> 01:00:48.094
Not even of wisdom.

01:00:48.224 --> 01:00:51.806
And there is Sheban wine
to warm the heart.

01:00:53.062 --> 01:00:55.101
My offering to you.

01:00:57.483 --> 01:01:01.183
Tonight, we are alone in a different world.

01:01:02.738 --> 01:01:04.778
My world.

01:01:07.201 --> 01:01:09.490
Yes, we are in a different world.

01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:29.130
Is not the wine to your taste, my Lord?

01:01:30.474 --> 01:01:35.516
It almost made me forget
that you are an ally of the Pharaoh.

01:01:35.646 --> 01:01:37.224
An enemy of Israel.

01:01:48.742 --> 01:01:53.155
Your Majesty,
everything is prepared for tonight.

01:02:08.053 --> 01:02:09.678
I chose this one.

01:02:11.557 --> 01:02:15.471
Mmm. Attar of roses. I love it.

01:02:15.603 --> 01:02:18.438
- The king's favourite scent.
- How do you know?

01:02:18.564 --> 01:02:21.102
The women of his harem told me.

01:02:21.233 --> 01:02:24.068
I don't want to remind him
of other women.

01:02:25.487 --> 01:02:28.275
What else have you heard?

01:02:28.407 --> 01:02:32.025
They complain
of Solomon's neglect of them.

01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:35.861
There is no reason
to be jealous of me as yet.

01:02:35.998 --> 01:02:40.126
In spite of the way he left,
he must have had difficulty forgetting you.

01:02:40.252 --> 01:02:44.961
Tonight, I will make it even more difficult.

01:02:46.091 --> 01:02:48.131
Dry me.

01:03:30.719 --> 01:03:35.512
He may still come, Majesty.
It is not yet midnight.

01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:38.310
Do I need you to tell me the time?

01:03:49.238 --> 01:03:52.192
Take it away. Get it out of my sight.

01:03:54.702 --> 01:03:57.193
How dare he treat me this way!

01:03:57.329 --> 01:04:02.075
What does he think I am?
Just another cat in his royal cage?!

01:04:02.209 --> 01:04:04.914
I don't care if he never comes!

01:04:05.045 --> 01:04:07.085
Never. Never.

01:04:23.189 --> 01:04:25.430
Weren't you supposed to dine with her?

01:04:25.566 --> 01:04:29.777
- Yes, I was.
- Then why are you sitting here alone?

01:04:30.696 --> 01:04:33.152
I felt in need of being alone.

01:04:34.283 --> 01:04:38.494
What is it that weighs
so heavily upon your heart?

01:04:39.747 --> 01:04:42.154
Has it come to where
you can read my thoughts?

01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:44.782
Haven't I always shared your thoughts?

01:04:44.919 --> 01:04:47.244
Yes.

01:04:47.379 --> 01:04:52.456
At times, a man feels drawn
toward the dangers that confront him,

01:04:52.593 --> 01:04:55.926
even at the risk of his own destruction.

01:04:56.055 --> 01:04:58.724
Like a moth approaches a flame.

01:05:00.184 --> 01:05:03.849
Is there something different
about this flame?

01:05:03.979 --> 01:05:06.435
I could put it out in one second.

01:05:06.565 --> 01:05:11.311
- Wouldn't that be simpler?
- Such a little flame, Abishag.

01:05:11.445 --> 01:05:15.525
And yet unrestrained,
it could destroy all of Jerusalem.

01:05:15.658 --> 01:05:18.149
Simpler, yes,

01:05:18.285 --> 01:05:22.497
but perhaps without it,
there would be darkness.

01:05:25.084 --> 01:05:30.671
In light or in darkness,
you've only to reach for my hand.

01:05:31.507 --> 01:05:33.832
I'll be at your side always.

01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:47.521
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:06:09.336 --> 01:06:13.120
- His Majesty.
- His Majesty.

01:07:34.088 --> 01:07:35.712
Sire.

01:07:36.882 --> 01:07:41.129
Her Majesty awaited you until
after midnight and then she retired.

01:07:41.262 --> 01:07:44.927
- I'm sorry.
- Takyan, admit His Majesty.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.195
I have disturbed your rest.

01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:04.908
Could I rest, thinking that perhaps
I had displeased you in some way?

01:08:05.035 --> 01:08:08.451
Now you have to be
completely truthful with me.

01:08:08.581 --> 01:08:11.119
Why did you come to Jerusalem?

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:17.254
Why do you ask me such a question now?

01:08:17.381 --> 01:08:22.209
Because I know that behind those lovely
eyes is the brain of a very clever woman

01:08:22.344 --> 01:08:27.718
who would never have travelled
800 leagues without a purpose.

01:08:35.983 --> 01:08:38.474
You have found me out.

01:08:38.611 --> 01:08:40.649
I will confess to you.

01:08:41.738 --> 01:08:46.899
The Pharaoh is paying me
a fabulous price to spy on you.

01:08:47.036 --> 01:08:49.906
To deliver to him all of your secrets.

01:08:50.538 --> 01:08:54.488
I have considered that,
but Israel has no real secrets from Egypt.

01:08:54.627 --> 01:08:59.170
Pharaoh is aware
of our weaknesses and our strength.

01:09:00.174 --> 01:09:02.843
How could I hope to deceive you?

01:09:04.261 --> 01:09:06.752
I have been trying to entrap you.

01:09:07.932 --> 01:09:10.173
With these.

01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:17.058
To bind you to me in soft chains
so that I may do with you as I will.

01:09:17.191 --> 01:09:20.524
Now perhaps we are
approaching the truth.

01:09:20.653 --> 01:09:23.191
Every woman exacts her price
from a man.

01:09:23.322 --> 01:09:26.738
You're a queen,
but you also demand a price.

01:09:26.867 --> 01:09:30.651
I do. So great that I wonder
if you will pay it.

01:09:31.913 --> 01:09:36.042
I want you to love me wholly, completely,

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:40.663
and that love to be
the most precious thing in your life.

01:09:40.798 --> 01:09:43.205
I hope it is true,

01:09:43.341 --> 01:09:47.803
but if it is not,
then let me remain blind to the truth.

01:10:10.327 --> 01:10:13.910
Even when you are not with me,
I find myself trying to recall

01:10:14.039 --> 01:10:16.412
every moment we have spent together.

01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:20.290
The words you have said to me,
I will never forget.

01:10:20.421 --> 01:10:26.126
After what has come to pass between us,
new words keep singing in my heart.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:31.301
- Tell them to me.
- Behold, thou art fair, my love.

01:10:31.432 --> 01:10:35.845
Thine eyes are as doves,
thy lips are as pomegranates.

01:10:35.978 --> 01:10:38.813
How much better is thy love than wine.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.817
I have never before
known such happiness.

01:10:43.944 --> 01:10:50.196
Nor I, and if I have thought I was happy,
I know now that I was deceived.

01:11:06.217 --> 01:11:11.673
You look like two birds
who have hatched out a nestful of snakes.

01:11:13.224 --> 01:11:18.051
You may speak freely.
I have no secrets from Joab.

01:11:18.187 --> 01:11:21.472
We have come to take counsel
with Your Highness.

01:11:21.607 --> 01:11:26.518
About what? I am the commander
of the host, not a minister of state.

01:11:26.654 --> 01:11:28.693
It concerns the king.

01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:34.070
- Then why not consult with him?
- Because he will not listen.

01:11:34.203 --> 01:11:37.951
Grave criticism is being
brought against him by people.

01:11:38.082 --> 01:11:41.581
Who would dare to murmur
against the great Solomon?

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:46.372
His association with the Sheban queen
has developed into an open scandal.

01:11:46.507 --> 01:11:50.884
Worse, he has even brought this
pagan woman to live within the palace,

01:11:51.011 --> 01:11:56.765
daring to install her in an apartment
adjoining his own private chambers.

01:11:57.935 --> 01:11:59.762
That is his affair, not mine.

01:11:59.895 --> 01:12:04.225
We thought perhaps if you were to
talk to him privately, reason with him.

01:12:04.358 --> 01:12:08.438
Point out that it is a matter
of concern not only to the high priest

01:12:08.571 --> 01:12:10.943
but to the prophet and the council.

01:12:11.073 --> 01:12:14.359
I, presume to admonish His Majesty?

01:12:14.493 --> 01:12:18.242
You forget, Hezrai, he is the king.
The king can do no wrong.

01:12:18.372 --> 01:12:20.910
Well, something must be done.

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:26.332
Not by me. You are his chancellor, Hezrai,
and you his high priest, Zadok.

01:12:27.756 --> 01:12:31.375
You do something. You reason with him.

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:36.219
We had hoped for the cooperation
of Your Highness.

01:12:36.348 --> 01:12:40.263
You have it.
My sympathies and my best wishes.

01:12:42.313 --> 01:12:44.270
We thank you for receiving us.

01:12:44.398 --> 01:12:46.521
Not at all, not at all.

01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:48.690
Always at your service.

01:12:53.574 --> 01:12:58.699
It could not have served your interests
better if you had arranged her visit.

01:12:58.829 --> 01:13:03.491
The priesthood is aroused against him.
The council condemns him.

01:13:03.626 --> 01:13:07.575
Even the people talk openly of his shame.

01:13:07.713 --> 01:13:11.129
Your Highness is reflecting
my own thoughts.

01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:14.717
I would be a fool
to ignore such an opportunity.

01:13:14.845 --> 01:13:19.673
You might have to wait forever
for another one like this.

01:13:20.601 --> 01:13:23.934
I will solve
Hezrai and Zadok's problem for them

01:13:24.063 --> 01:13:26.554
and at the same time, my own.

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:34.235
Or rather, this is a problem that you, Joab,
with a little help, will solve.

01:13:34.365 --> 01:13:37.116
I await your command, Highness.

01:13:51.131 --> 01:13:53.504
Your Majesty commanded me
to attend upon her?

01:13:53.634 --> 01:13:58.343
It took you long enough to get here.
I sent Takyan to bring you an hour ago.

01:13:58.472 --> 01:14:01.259
Ten minutes ago, if Your Majesty pleases.

01:14:01.392 --> 01:14:04.061
Come in. Don't stand there
arguing with me.

01:14:06.146 --> 01:14:09.515
In what way can I serve Your Majesty?

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:14.276
You can arrange
for my safe conduct out of Israel.

01:14:14.405 --> 01:14:17.571
Stop looking at me like that!
Do as I tell you!

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:22.575
- But when, Your Majesty?
- Now. Today. This minute.

01:14:22.705 --> 01:14:25.492
Your Majesty will pardon me
if I seem shocked...

01:14:25.624 --> 01:14:30.037
Do I have to consult you first
concerning everything I wish to do?

01:14:30.171 --> 01:14:34.251
Your Majesty would go without
accomplishing her purpose?

01:14:34.383 --> 01:14:38.796
Permit me to decide the question
of my comings and goings.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:45.718
Your Majesty will forgive me if I venture
to touch upon her personal, private affairs.

01:14:45.853 --> 01:14:47.976
Get to the point, Baltor.

01:14:48.105 --> 01:14:52.233
I have sensed a change
in Your Majesty. A softening.

01:14:52.359 --> 01:14:54.732
A desire to evade reality.

01:14:54.862 --> 01:14:59.191
You are accusing me
of being in love with him? Is that it?

01:14:59.325 --> 01:15:03.737
I hope for Your Majesty's own sake
that such is not the case.

01:15:05.497 --> 01:15:07.905
And if such is the case,

01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:15.333
do you deny me the right
for the first time in my life to be human?

01:15:15.466 --> 01:15:20.211
May I remind Your Majesty that
you cannot put your personal feelings

01:15:20.346 --> 01:15:23.133
above the Pharaoh
and the good of your country?

01:15:23.265 --> 01:15:24.807
Don't lecture me, Baltor.

01:15:24.934 --> 01:15:29.560
Your Majesty once told me that you could
not afford the luxury of being a woman,

01:15:29.688 --> 01:15:33.686
that always you were forced
to remember that you are a queen,

01:15:33.817 --> 01:15:38.479
and that your only love,
your only thought, must be your duty.

01:15:38.614 --> 01:15:40.690
Your Majesty came to Jerusalem

01:15:40.824 --> 01:15:44.240
in search of a means to destroy
an enemy whom you once hated!

01:15:47.164 --> 01:15:49.240
Yes, Baltor.

01:15:49.375 --> 01:15:52.459
I have been trying to evade reality.

01:15:52.586 --> 01:15:58.459
I have found myself trying to forget
the purpose for which I came,

01:15:58.592 --> 01:16:03.301
as one would try to forget an evil dream.

01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:07.214
I have been reluctant
to make an end of him.

01:16:08.352 --> 01:16:12.979
The most merciful way to kill is to thrust
quickly and strongly with a knife.

01:16:13.107 --> 01:16:17.650
It seems to me that we are no nearer a kill
than we were before we came.

01:16:18.863 --> 01:16:24.652
You are wrong, Baltor. I have known
for days how to destroy Solomon.

01:16:25.703 --> 01:16:31.955
Suppose I get his permission to hold the
rites of Rha-Gon upon the soil of Israel,

01:16:32.084 --> 01:16:36.912
to set up a pagan god
in the face of the great Jehovah,

01:16:37.047 --> 01:16:43.133
the one god who commands the Israelites
to have no other god before him?

01:16:43.387 --> 01:16:47.171
That would cause more
than angry murmurings against him.

01:16:47.308 --> 01:16:50.926
The priests and the people
would rise up against Solomon.

01:16:51.061 --> 01:16:52.472
Yes, Baltor.

01:16:53.355 --> 01:16:56.855
His own people
would accomplish his end.

01:17:00.237 --> 01:17:05.576
Are you satisfied now
that I am still the Queen of Sheba?

01:17:09.663 --> 01:17:11.703
Majesty.

01:17:27.681 --> 01:17:31.181
How many times
shall I tell you that I love you?

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:34.809
Over and over,
until you make me believe it.

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:40.190
I will.

01:17:42.404 --> 01:17:45.358
But you have known so many loves.

01:17:45.491 --> 01:17:47.614
I will take you by the hand

01:17:47.743 --> 01:17:54.196
and in the temple, before all Israel,
I'll pledge you my love in marriage.

01:17:54.333 --> 01:17:59.209
To shut me away in your harem?
To share your love?

01:17:59.338 --> 01:18:02.007
No, to share my throne with you.

01:18:04.468 --> 01:18:07.967
You honour me, but I am already a queen.

01:18:08.097 --> 01:18:12.391
We will join our lands
as we will join our lives.

01:18:12.518 --> 01:18:16.979
A dream that can never be.
Too much stands between us.

01:18:17.106 --> 01:18:19.775
Nothing must stand between us.

01:18:22.278 --> 01:18:24.519
Not even our gods?

01:18:25.906 --> 01:18:32.194
I knew this moment would come, for the
things we believe in are not the same.

01:18:32.329 --> 01:18:35.745
I had hoped that in time
you would come to accept Jehovah.

01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:40.536
As king of Israel, would you abandon
the god of your people for mine?

01:18:44.508 --> 01:18:46.548
Still I dared hope.

01:18:48.971 --> 01:18:52.803
My love, I must leave Israel.

01:18:52.933 --> 01:18:55.851
Why? Why? I cannot let you go.

01:18:55.978 --> 01:19:00.106
The time has come
for the yearly feast of Rha-Gon.

01:19:00.232 --> 01:19:04.396
Can you grant me permission
to hold it here in Israel?

01:19:04.528 --> 01:19:06.817
It would be a sacrilege.

01:19:08.115 --> 01:19:12.824
Then I must go to celebrate it elsewhere.

01:19:13.913 --> 01:19:18.621
You see? You cannot banish
what stands between us.

01:19:20.711 --> 01:19:24.294
No, wait. Listen to me.
There must be a way to...

01:19:26.133 --> 01:19:27.675
No!

01:19:55.538 --> 01:19:57.910
Help! Help! The king!

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.080
Help! Guard! Josiah!

01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:26.228
Joab.

01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:33.530
Are you safe, sire?

01:20:40.249 --> 01:20:42.621
We'll deliver him to the one who sent him.

01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:44.791
Come on!

01:20:50.885 --> 01:20:54.051
Thank all the gods you are not harmed.

01:20:55.097 --> 01:21:01.349
For the first time in my life,
I... I had no thought for myself.

01:21:01.478 --> 01:21:03.518
I feared only for him.

01:21:24.418 --> 01:21:28.167
You men, that way.
The rest, follow me.

01:21:45.064 --> 01:21:47.637
Are you expecting me to plead for mercy?

01:21:47.775 --> 01:21:51.475
I have overlooked your hatred
because of your value to Israel.

01:21:51.612 --> 01:21:54.648
- I pledged never to turn against you.
- I asked for no pledge.

01:21:54.782 --> 01:21:58.614
But tonight you raised your hand
against the life of Israel.

01:21:58.744 --> 01:22:02.327
You and your Sheban slut
have defiled the fair name of Israel.

01:22:02.456 --> 01:22:07.165
I sought only to preserve our country
from your contamination.

01:22:08.128 --> 01:22:12.209
Only because the blood of David
flows through your veins as well as mine,

01:22:12.341 --> 01:22:15.959
I grant you your life,
but I banish you from Israel forever.

01:22:16.095 --> 01:22:21.089
I suppose I should be grateful, but you
should be concerned with your own life -

01:22:21.225 --> 01:22:24.641
if it has not already been lost
to the poison of Sheba.

01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:28.269
- Remove him, Josiah.
- Take him, and him.

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:42.029
I charge you to cleanse yourself of
this iniquity you have permitted to spawn.

01:22:42.162 --> 01:22:46.291
Abjure this woman of her idolatries. Tear
down the abomination she has erected.

01:22:46.417 --> 01:22:51.292
I have given her permission
to hold the sacred rite of her own religion.

01:22:51.422 --> 01:22:53.829
A pagan revel! An orgy!

01:22:53.966 --> 01:22:56.635
I have no apology to make
for what I have done.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.919
As I have commanded, so shall it be.

01:22:59.054 --> 01:23:03.004
You have broken God's covenant
and his commandment:

01:23:03.142 --> 01:23:05.348
"Thou shalt have no other gods
before me."

01:23:05.477 --> 01:23:08.313
"Thou shalt not make unto thyself
any graven images."

01:23:08.439 --> 01:23:12.187
"Thou shalt not kill."
But murder was attempted against me.

01:23:12.318 --> 01:23:16.150
If Sheba had not escaped,
the assassins would not have spared her.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:21.357
The permission I have granted is poor
compensation for the crime attempted.

01:23:21.493 --> 01:23:26.155
It seems that in your lust for this woman,
you have lost your reason.

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:30.952
Choose your words carefully, Hezrai.
It is love I have for her.

01:23:31.086 --> 01:23:34.087
Out of love,
I offered to share this throne with her.

01:23:34.215 --> 01:23:37.584
And out of love, I will attend her ritual.

01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:44.383
- Hear me, Solomon.
- I have heard all I want to hear from you.

01:23:44.517 --> 01:23:47.352
Then hear the voice of God.

01:23:47.478 --> 01:23:50.645
The royal raiment
will be stripped from you.

01:23:50.773 --> 01:23:52.812
You will cry out your repentance,

01:23:52.942 --> 01:23:56.560
but the ears and hearts of your people
will be closed against you.

01:23:56.695 --> 01:24:01.073
And my ears are closed to cackling priests
and mumbling old men.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.783
I will show you
I am king in Israel, not you.

01:24:09.708 --> 01:24:13.124
Woe unto you, Solomon.

01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:55.794
Rha-Gon! Rha-Gon!

01:25:37.796 --> 01:25:43.633
Hear us, O Rha-Gon,
god of love, giver of life.

01:25:43.761 --> 01:25:46.927
Let thy spirit enter into our bodies.

01:25:47.056 --> 01:25:51.100
Endow our men with strength and vitality

01:25:51.227 --> 01:25:54.809
and our women with endless fruitfulness.

01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:58.575
My door was closed.

01:26:58.711 --> 01:27:01.498
Must you intrude upon my privacy?

01:27:01.630 --> 01:27:05.295
Can you shut out your conscience
by closing the door?

01:27:05.426 --> 01:27:08.877
Say what you must,
then please leave me alone.

01:27:09.013 --> 01:27:11.848
I come seeking the man I once knew.

01:27:11.974 --> 01:27:16.850
The man who was noble, gentle and kind,
the man who walked with God.

01:27:16.979 --> 01:27:21.392
- Those are mere words, Abishag.
- I entreat you to listen.

01:27:21.525 --> 01:27:26.317
When I was a child,
you were the world and I adored you.

01:27:26.447 --> 01:27:31.156
But time passed,
and love changed even as I did.

01:27:31.285 --> 01:27:35.199
My love became
that of a woman for a man.

01:27:35.331 --> 01:27:37.738
But the man became a king,

01:27:37.875 --> 01:27:42.916
and in his eyes,
the woman was still a child.

01:27:55.059 --> 01:27:57.514
I know how strongly it calls to you.

01:27:57.645 --> 01:28:03.268
Listen to your people. Their love
calls to you, as I call in my love.

01:28:04.443 --> 01:28:06.815
Listen to them if not to me.

01:28:06.946 --> 01:28:09.863
Whether you or my people approve,
I must go.

01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:13.110
You cannot go. Do not destroy yourself!

01:28:13.911 --> 01:28:15.950
I beg of you!

01:31:43.746 --> 01:31:47.874
Lord God, hear the prayer of thy servant.

01:31:49.043 --> 01:31:53.954
Mine was not the strength
to save my lord Solomon from himself.

01:31:54.089 --> 01:31:59.676
But thine is the power.
Let not thy wrath descend upon him.

01:32:00.846 --> 01:32:04.547
Look into his heart and pity him.

01:32:05.518 --> 01:32:11.603
But if it be thy will to punish him,
visit it upon me in his stead.

01:35:21.505 --> 01:35:23.545
Oh, no.

01:35:26.135 --> 01:35:28.174
Oh, no.

01:35:44.862 --> 01:35:46.901
Why?

01:35:48.616 --> 01:35:53.776
The sin was mine.
Why did you not strike me?

01:35:53.913 --> 01:35:58.124
I warned you, Solomon.
The hand of God is upon you.

01:37:14.535 --> 01:37:16.824
Majesty, you must rest.

01:37:18.455 --> 01:37:20.495
I cannot rest, Takyan.

01:37:27.506 --> 01:37:33.675
I have come to ask your permission
to arrange your immediate departure.

01:37:33.804 --> 01:37:35.085
Yes.

01:37:35.222 --> 01:37:37.927
Let us go - quickly.

01:37:38.058 --> 01:37:44.263
There is no reason for us to remain now
that I have accomplished my purpose.

01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:54.148
Your Majesty should not reproach herself.
It was nothing more than a sudden storm.

01:37:54.283 --> 01:37:59.657
It is not the first time lightning
has dealt death, nor will it be the last.

01:37:59.788 --> 01:38:04.700
Was it nothing more than a coincidence?

01:38:04.835 --> 01:38:08.251
Surely Your Majesty
cannot believe the Israelites,

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:13.126
that it was a sign
of the anger and revenge of their god?

01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:18.136
- I no longer know what I do believe.
- Majesty, you're overwrought.

01:38:18.265 --> 01:38:22.559
Yes, the strain of the last few days
has affected us all.

01:38:22.686 --> 01:38:27.681
But this is your hour of triumph.
The Pharaoh will rejoice in your victory.

01:38:27.816 --> 01:38:30.486
Sheba can be proud of her queen.

01:38:32.029 --> 01:38:35.445
I am very proud of myself.

01:38:35.574 --> 01:38:40.995
I have earned my reward from Egypt.
We will have our port on the Red Sea.

01:38:41.121 --> 01:38:44.870
We will have more gold,
more power, more everything.

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:51.120
Because I have betrayed
a great man who trusted me,

01:38:51.257 --> 01:38:54.341
who loved me beyond all else.

01:39:05.563 --> 01:39:08.433
The Sheban. The Sheban is coming.

01:39:20.244 --> 01:39:22.283
Here comes the Sheban.

01:39:27.418 --> 01:39:29.541
- The Sheban.
- Come away.

01:39:35.634 --> 01:39:41.008
Your Majesty understands that it is not
a request that you attend the council.

01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:44.924
It is a command
from the elders of the tribes.

01:39:47.021 --> 01:39:51.149
I have no wish to evade
what they have to say to me.

01:40:10.211 --> 01:40:13.046
You should not have taken the risk
of coming here.

01:40:13.172 --> 01:40:15.579
If I had not come now,

01:40:15.716 --> 01:40:19.417
I might have lost
the courage to come at all.

01:40:23.682 --> 01:40:26.387
Once, you asked me for truth.

01:40:27.186 --> 01:40:32.607
And I answered you with truth, but
I made it sound like a lie to deceive you.

01:40:33.651 --> 01:40:37.185
For I was a friend of the Pharaoh
and an enemy of Israel,

01:40:37.321 --> 01:40:41.532
and I came here out of hatred
to destroy you.

01:40:45.621 --> 01:40:49.072
Had I known this
the day you arrived in Jerusalem,

01:40:49.208 --> 01:40:51.995
it would have changed nothing.

01:40:52.127 --> 01:40:54.879
Mine is the greater guilt.

01:40:55.005 --> 01:41:00.426
For I have known from the first
where you would lead, I would follow.

01:41:04.473 --> 01:41:08.056
But why did you not just go
without explanations?

01:41:08.185 --> 01:41:10.474
Because I love you.

01:41:10.604 --> 01:41:13.309
What I have done, I cannot undo.

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.399
Do with me what you will,
but this you must believe.

01:41:18.529 --> 01:41:20.771
My love is not a lie.

01:41:41.385 --> 01:41:44.801
Think not to appease the wrath of Israel
with remorse.

01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:48.548
Neither will God's anger be turned aside.

01:41:48.684 --> 01:41:50.973
I will speak no words in my defence.

01:41:51.103 --> 01:41:54.057
What could you say
in view of your transgressions?

01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:57.274
Because of you, dissension fills the land.

01:41:57.401 --> 01:42:00.070
The unity of the nation is sundered.

01:42:04.909 --> 01:42:06.782
Even as this,

01:42:06.911 --> 01:42:11.204
the symbol of its oneness,
is broken into fragments.

01:42:24.178 --> 01:42:28.970
The elders of the tribes deny you
as their king and depart from you.

01:42:29.099 --> 01:42:32.515
The Lord God will smite you into the dust

01:42:32.645 --> 01:42:34.970
and his people will praise his name.

01:42:35.105 --> 01:42:36.730
So be it.

01:43:20.985 --> 01:43:23.736
Folly is set on great heights,

01:43:25.531 --> 01:43:30.276
and that which has been done
is that which shall be done.

01:43:31.745 --> 01:43:35.577
Who knows
what is good for a man in his life,

01:43:37.168 --> 01:43:40.667
his vain life
which he spends as a shadow?

01:43:42.298 --> 01:43:47.256
Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:56.514
But if ye turn away
and forsake my statutes,

01:43:56.645 --> 01:44:01.438
then I will pluck them up by the roots
out of my land which I have given them,

01:44:01.567 --> 01:44:03.606
and this house which is high

01:44:03.736 --> 01:44:09.572
shall be an astonishment to everyone
that passeth by it, so that he shall say

01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:14.362
"Why hath the Lord done thus
unto this land and unto this house?"

01:44:14.496 --> 01:44:20.369
And it shall be answered "Because they
forsook the Lord God of their fathers

01:44:20.503 --> 01:44:23.753
which brought them forth
out of the land of Egypt

01:44:23.881 --> 01:44:29.587
and laid hold on other gods
and worshipped them and served them."

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:34.263
"Therefore hath he brought
all this evil upon them."

01:44:37.144 --> 01:44:39.303
The elders have denounced Solomon,

01:44:39.438 --> 01:44:42.807
and the captains of the host
have returned to their own provinces.

01:44:42.942 --> 01:44:45.018
This is the time to strike, Majesty.

01:44:45.152 --> 01:44:49.399
All Israel is in turmoil,
and Solomon stands alone.

01:44:49.532 --> 01:44:53.232
It seems that your information
is more accurate than mine.

01:44:54.245 --> 01:44:58.492
Has not the Queen of Sheba
given you a full report on the situation?

01:44:58.624 --> 01:45:02.787
I have been wondering,
awaiting word from her.

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:06.253
You mean she has told you nothing
of what I have reported?

01:45:06.382 --> 01:45:08.624
Nothing.

01:45:08.759 --> 01:45:12.804
Perhaps in her new love,
she has forgotten her obligation to you

01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:16.097
and finds her alliance with Solomon
more to her liking.

01:45:17.893 --> 01:45:21.013
You have told me
everything I should know,

01:45:21.146 --> 01:45:25.310
excepting your price for my support
of you against your brother.

01:45:26.986 --> 01:45:30.734
I want the crown of Israel.
It has always been mine.

01:45:32.199 --> 01:45:35.817
And command of the army
that you send against Solomon.

01:45:38.122 --> 01:45:39.949
I grant it.

01:45:40.082 --> 01:45:43.866
But there is one thing I want from you.

01:45:44.003 --> 01:45:47.537
You will be the instrument
of my punishment of Sheba

01:45:47.673 --> 01:45:49.713
for her betrayal of me.

01:45:53.637 --> 01:45:56.307
On that, Majesty, you can rely.

01:45:59.518 --> 01:46:01.926
Hail to the new king of Israel.

01:46:02.897 --> 01:46:05.435
Hail to the new king of Israel.

01:46:22.124 --> 01:46:25.291
Can your brother equal such strength?

01:46:25.419 --> 01:46:28.870
He will be able to gather
only a handful of followers.

01:46:29.006 --> 01:46:33.633
We will strike quickly.
The victory must be decisive.

01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:45.310
How many do they number?

01:46:45.439 --> 01:46:47.230
Thousands.

01:46:47.358 --> 01:46:50.228
- You saw them cross over the border?
- Yes, Majesty.

01:46:50.361 --> 01:46:53.231
A column from horizon to horizon.

01:46:57.576 --> 01:47:00.447
It was to be expected eventually.

01:47:05.668 --> 01:47:08.538
We'll go out and face the Egyptians.

01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:10.794
Give the orders, Josiah.

01:47:11.966 --> 01:47:14.801
Gather what forces you can.

01:47:14.927 --> 01:47:16.966
Yes, sire.

01:47:32.319 --> 01:47:35.569
With these
we hope to stem the Egyptian horde?

01:47:35.698 --> 01:47:39.826
My father David faced Goliath
with a stone and a shepherd's sling.

01:47:39.952 --> 01:47:42.443
God was with David.

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:46.660
- Forgive me, sire.
- There is nothing to forgive.

01:47:46.792 --> 01:47:51.620
All Israel knows
that God has abandoned the son of David.

01:48:06.729 --> 01:48:11.058
Majesty, you let him go
without a word of farewell.

01:48:11.192 --> 01:48:13.647
What could I have said to him?

01:48:15.946 --> 01:48:19.944
How could I have told him
that I carry his child?

01:48:32.546 --> 01:48:34.586
- Halt!
- Halt!

01:48:45.017 --> 01:48:49.311
- Highness, the enemy has been sighted.
- At what distance?

01:48:49.438 --> 01:48:51.929
Within one hour's march.

01:48:52.066 --> 01:48:56.728
Then they have travelled ten leagues
since dawn and we have travelled one.

01:48:56.862 --> 01:49:00.730
They are spent and exhausted
and we are still fresh.

01:49:00.866 --> 01:49:03.737
Two hours yet before the sun sets.

01:49:03.869 --> 01:49:06.111
- Deploy your men.
- Give the order.

01:49:06.247 --> 01:49:10.909
We want every man, horse, chariot,
hidden from Solomon's view.

01:49:11.043 --> 01:49:15.835
When he rides into the trap,
our attack will hit him from every quarter.

01:49:15.965 --> 01:49:18.538
Now deploy for attack!

01:49:18.676 --> 01:49:20.715
Deploy for attack!

01:49:21.679 --> 01:49:26.804
Take your positions. Deploy for attack!

01:49:49.456 --> 01:49:51.864
Sire, our men are spent.
Shall we call a rest?

01:49:52.001 --> 01:49:54.670
They will rest at the dunes of Saladar.

01:49:54.795 --> 01:49:57.333
There we will entrench
and await the enemy.

01:49:57.464 --> 01:50:01.130
Let the battle be joined
as far from Jerusalem as possible.

01:50:06.098 --> 01:50:09.218
Sire. Look, men on the hill.

01:50:09.351 --> 01:50:12.970
- Halt the column.
- Halt!

01:50:20.571 --> 01:50:22.445
Shunammites!

01:50:26.076 --> 01:50:28.746
They bear a flag of friendship.

01:50:32.875 --> 01:50:34.618
Ahab!

01:50:34.752 --> 01:50:36.661
We come to stand with the king.

01:50:38.714 --> 01:50:41.798
Why do you offer me your support
in this dark hour?

01:50:41.926 --> 01:50:46.089
Is your hatred for the Egyptians
greater than your hatred for me?

01:50:46.222 --> 01:50:50.599
We come in memory of the love
my daughter Abishag gave to you.

01:50:55.523 --> 01:50:59.935
- Then we will honour that memory.
- God willing.

01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:02.275
Fall in behind.

01:51:03.364 --> 01:51:06.614
- Josiah.
- Forward at the trot.

01:51:06.742 --> 01:51:09.529
Forward!

01:51:57.168 --> 01:51:59.207
Start the attack.

01:51:59.336 --> 01:52:02.337
Attack! Attack!

01:52:13.309 --> 01:52:15.348
Form a circle.

01:52:56.769 --> 01:53:01.265
Sire, your brother has joined forces
with the Egyptians against you.

01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:05.103
Break through. Break through. Faster.

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:27.498
Tell the Egyptians
to break through with their horsemen.

01:53:27.633 --> 01:53:30.089
- Break the circle.
- Charge!

01:54:14.597 --> 01:54:16.636
Sound the retreat.

01:54:26.567 --> 01:54:29.402
Joab, find Solomon.

01:55:36.136 --> 01:55:37.796
Let's try over there.

01:55:49.441 --> 01:55:54.732
Your Highness, we found Solomon's
shield but so far not Solomon.

01:55:57.992 --> 01:56:00.743
He must have crawled off
to hide with his rabble.

01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:03.740
In the morning,
we will dig them out of their burrows.

01:56:03.873 --> 01:56:08.285
I have more important things
than to occupy myself with a rabbit hunt.

01:56:08.419 --> 01:56:14.587
Keep searching. There'll be gold for the
man who brings me the head of Solomon.

01:56:15.676 --> 01:56:21.015
I'm impatient to enter Jerusalem. I do
not wish to be delayed by a slow army.

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:24.888
You will have no trouble
in destroying Solomon's resistance.

01:56:25.019 --> 01:56:29.313
When you have vanquished them,
follow me into Jerusalem with all speed.

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.682
How many men will you need to enter?

01:56:31.817 --> 01:56:35.435
Only a small escort.
I will meet with no resistance there.

01:56:35.571 --> 01:56:38.276
Your commands will be obeyed.

01:56:38.407 --> 01:56:43.781
Colonel Hassin with six officers
will go with His Majesty to Jerusalem.

01:56:58.177 --> 01:57:02.424
There'll be few of us left to face Adonijah
and his Egyptians by tomorrow.

01:57:02.556 --> 01:57:05.593
The faint-hearted are deserting us
in the darkness.

01:57:05.726 --> 01:57:07.719
Can you blame them, Josiah,

01:57:07.853 --> 01:57:11.554
after they have seen
even my own brother turn against me?

01:57:11.690 --> 01:57:14.644
I thought I knew
the driving passion of his ambitions,

01:57:14.777 --> 01:57:17.980
but never did I think
he would betray his own people.

01:57:23.035 --> 01:57:26.119
We only found
a few scattered units of our people,

01:57:26.247 --> 01:57:30.992
almost afraid to show themselves
even in the darkness.

01:57:32.628 --> 01:57:38.666
In the morning, the Egyptians
will march over us into Jerusalem.

01:57:38.801 --> 01:57:41.885
No matter how few of us are left,
we will fight on.

01:57:42.012 --> 01:57:44.883
If I cannot live as a king with honour,

01:57:45.015 --> 01:57:48.301
at least I can die as a king with honour.

01:57:52.356 --> 01:57:55.227
Woe unto us! Our king is defeated!

01:58:07.288 --> 01:58:08.865
Majesty.

01:58:08.998 --> 01:58:14.039
The outcry is over the news brought
by deserters from Solomon's army.

01:58:14.170 --> 01:58:18.084
It seems he has been defeated,
his men routed.

01:58:20.593 --> 01:58:23.759
Is he... among the dead?

01:58:23.888 --> 01:58:26.972
No one knows,
but all say that by morning,

01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:30.598
not one Israelite will escape alive.

01:58:30.728 --> 01:58:35.473
Now will Your Majesty seek safety?
The Israelites will blame you.

01:58:35.608 --> 01:58:40.353
I beg Your Majesty, do not refuse again.
You must save yourself.

01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:49.742
- Majesty, where are you going?
- Do not try to stop me, Baltor.

01:58:49.872 --> 01:58:53.157
I will not let you take the risk
of going into the streets.

01:58:53.292 --> 01:58:55.331
Stand aside!

01:59:02.885 --> 01:59:06.088
I command you both,
do not follow after me.

01:59:13.729 --> 01:59:18.557
Solomon is vanquished!
How are the mighty fallen.

01:59:18.692 --> 01:59:22.524
Woe unto us.
The Egyptians will be upon us.

01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:27.198
The Lord
has punished Solomon for his sins.

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:30.742
Who will save us now from Pharaoh?

01:59:30.871 --> 01:59:34.287
Our sins
have brought this upon us.

01:59:34.416 --> 01:59:39.791
Woe unto us. The Egyptians
have overthrown our noble Solomon.

01:59:42.091 --> 01:59:44.214
Pharaoh will slay us all.

01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:50.468
Solomon did not follow
the path of God.

02:00:13.038 --> 02:00:15.161
God of Israel,

02:00:15.291 --> 02:00:20.795
thou who art called
the all-knowing, the compassionate,

02:00:20.921 --> 02:00:25.049
look into my heart and hear my prayer.

02:00:25.176 --> 02:00:28.675
Forgive my sin against thee
and thy people.

02:00:28.804 --> 02:00:34.593
Grant me the life of Solomon
and preserve him against his enemies.

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:40.563
Do this, and I will return to the land
of Sheba and cast down the false gods.

02:00:40.733 --> 02:00:45.858
And I will build a tabernacle
to the glory of thy name,

02:00:45.988 --> 02:00:49.772
and there shall be
no other gods before thee.

02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:28.860
Josiah.

02:01:30.199 --> 02:01:33.568
- What has alarmed you, sire?
- Not alarm, but hope.

02:01:33.702 --> 02:01:36.739
Hope that comes like a light
in the midst of darkness.

02:01:36.872 --> 02:01:41.415
It is as though God had come to me
and showed me the way.

02:01:43.504 --> 02:01:45.413
Yes?

02:01:45.548 --> 02:01:47.587
Sire.

02:01:54.014 --> 02:01:57.383
- Our men return.
- And there.

02:02:07.444 --> 02:02:09.437
And there!

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:34.714
They rally to us, by the hundreds.

02:02:50.905 --> 02:02:55.697
Set them to burnishing their shields.
Let them shine like mirrors.

02:02:57.286 --> 02:02:59.325
Yes, sire.

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:36.073
I remember you once lectured me, Hezrai,
on how a king of Israel is crowned.

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:42.027
Are there any among you
who deny my right to sit upon this throne?

02:03:45.668 --> 02:03:49.748
Then I need no senseless ritual
to attend my elevation.

02:03:52.883 --> 02:03:55.457
No anointing with the waters of Gihon.

02:03:56.303 --> 02:04:00.515
I take with my own hands
what has always been mine.

02:04:02.518 --> 02:04:05.685
Hail Adonijah, Lion of Israel.

02:04:05.813 --> 02:04:07.852
Hail Adonijah.

02:04:10.025 --> 02:04:14.023
Know this, all of you.
I have made an alliance with the Pharaoh.

02:04:14.154 --> 02:04:17.108
Under his protection, I will rule Israel,

02:04:17.241 --> 02:04:20.526
and I'll have no mercy
on any who oppose me.

02:04:20.661 --> 02:04:23.282
Sire, the Sheban harlot has been found.

02:04:23.414 --> 02:04:26.368
She has taken refuge in the temple.

02:04:50.816 --> 02:04:53.900
- Halt!
- Halt!

02:05:04.288 --> 02:05:07.574
- Again the Israelites.
- Where did they gather so many men?

02:05:07.708 --> 02:05:10.329
Last night we could find none,
only their dead.

02:05:10.461 --> 02:05:13.830
In a few minutes, they will all be dead.

02:05:13.964 --> 02:05:16.965
Today there is no darkness
into which they can escape.

02:05:17.092 --> 02:05:19.583
They face east,
and will be blinded by the sun.

02:05:26.018 --> 02:05:29.102
- Prepare for a frontal attack.
- Frontal attack.

02:05:47.748 --> 02:05:51.497
- They are going to charge us.
- Wait for my signal.

02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:08.638
Attack. Strike them down.

02:06:08.769 --> 02:06:10.809
Attack!

02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:17.937
Charge!

02:07:11.749 --> 02:07:13.788
Sire?

02:07:25.221 --> 02:07:28.221
- Now!
- Shields forward.

02:09:37.228 --> 02:09:41.475
Lord God of Israel,
thine is the victory.

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:43.979
Thou art our sword and our shield.

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:46.980
Lord God of hosts.

02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:53.198
Thou art the Lord God. What thou hast
done was out of love for thy people.

02:09:54.662 --> 02:09:59.620
If thou knowest what is in my heart,
grant me forgiveness.

02:09:59.750 --> 02:10:01.790
Amen.

02:10:05.256 --> 02:10:07.628
Ahab. Josiah.

02:10:07.758 --> 02:10:10.712
Choose 20 men. Mount them on horses.

02:10:10.845 --> 02:10:13.632
Gather up the Egyptians' banners
from the dust.

02:10:13.764 --> 02:10:19.185
We will ride with them to Jerusalem
to proclaim that the City of David is saved.

02:10:22.898 --> 02:10:27.062
By now,
Solomon is dead by his own deeds.

02:10:27.194 --> 02:10:30.195
An Egyptian sword
has rendered judgement upon him.

02:10:30.948 --> 02:10:35.444
It is I, Adonijah, who has prevented
the hordes from falling upon you

02:10:35.578 --> 02:10:37.238
and razing this city.

02:10:37.371 --> 02:10:42.792
- Hail Adonijah, saviour of Israel.
- Hail Adonijah.

02:10:43.752 --> 02:10:47.667
There in the temple
is the cause of all your troubles.

02:10:47.798 --> 02:10:51.084
It was she
who brought disaster upon Israel.

02:10:51.218 --> 02:10:54.338
- What shall be done with her?
- Let the dogs devour her.

02:10:54.471 --> 02:10:58.884
- Drag her through the streets.
- Give her to us.

02:10:59.018 --> 02:11:02.054
The sanctuary of the temple
must not be violated.

02:11:05.065 --> 02:11:10.486
In the Israel that I rule,
there is no sanctuary for a pagan harlot.

02:11:10.613 --> 02:11:13.697
You are her judges. I give her to you.

02:12:06.919 --> 02:12:08.958
Let me pass.

02:12:10.339 --> 02:12:12.379
Let me pass.

02:12:15.135 --> 02:12:19.596
Once before I told you I was king
and you called me an impostor.

02:12:19.723 --> 02:12:22.677
Now I shall prove to you
that I am the king.

02:12:22.810 --> 02:12:26.854
I grant you
the honour of my first judgement.

02:12:26.981 --> 02:12:29.020
Stone her!

02:12:41.996 --> 02:12:45.365
- I have spoken. Obey my command.
- Stone her.

02:12:46.333 --> 02:12:47.993
Kill the pagan slut.

02:13:07.855 --> 02:13:11.271
Solomon! Victory! Victory!

02:13:26.123 --> 02:13:29.290
Victory! Victory! Solomon returns.

02:13:36.717 --> 02:13:39.671
- Victory!
- Solomon!

02:14:04.161 --> 02:14:08.455
Solomon! Once before
you robbed me of my birthright,

02:14:08.582 --> 02:14:10.954
but this time I'll not be denied!

02:14:12.044 --> 02:14:14.831
Sheathe your sword.
I will not break my pledge.

02:14:14.964 --> 02:14:17.633
I will sheathe it in your heart.

02:16:06.075 --> 02:16:09.942
When none in Jerusalem believed
that you and Israel could be saved,

02:16:10.079 --> 02:16:15.951
she came into the temple and before the
sanctuary prayed you might be spared.

02:16:53.038 --> 02:16:57.700
For thine is the power and the glory.

02:16:57.834 --> 02:16:59.495
For ever.

02:17:03.883 --> 02:17:10.846
Because thou didst call upon my name
in thy dark hour, I have heard thee.

02:17:12.099 --> 02:17:15.385
Return therefore until thine own land

02:17:15.519 --> 02:17:19.433
and keep the covenant
thou didst make with me.

02:17:50.804 --> 02:17:55.846
Now I can tell you
that I am to bear the child of our love.

02:17:58.478 --> 02:18:03.520
Now you will be queen over Israel,
and our son shall reign after me.

02:18:04.151 --> 02:18:05.895
No.

02:18:06.028 --> 02:18:11.153
I gave promise to God
that I would return to my own land.

02:18:11.282 --> 02:18:15.281
For that he granted me your life
and his forgiveness.

02:18:15.412 --> 02:18:17.451
But how can I let you go?

02:18:19.458 --> 02:18:23.123
Your child shall reign in the land of Sheba.

02:18:23.254 --> 02:18:26.753
And if God grants us the blessing of a son,

02:18:26.882 --> 02:18:30.797
then for the first time
Sheba shall have a king,

02:18:31.971 --> 02:18:37.012
and he shall walk in the way
of the Lord God Jehovah.

02:18:40.771 --> 02:18:44.520
That we must part is our atonement.

02:18:48.736 --> 02:18:51.311
If this be thy will, O God,

02:18:52.449 --> 02:18:54.691
I submit to thy judgement.

02:18:55.786 --> 02:19:01.540
May thou watch between us
while we are apart, one from the other.

02:19:02.543 --> 02:19:06.161
I will be with you... always.

02:19:06.297 --> 02:19:11.041
Shout unto God, all the earth.
Sing praises unto the glory of his name.

02:19:18.392 --> 02:19:21.558
Sing praises unto the Lord, O Israel.

02:19:22.605 --> 02:19:24.977
Be gracious unto us, God.

02:19:25.107 --> 02:19:28.441
- And bless us.
- And bless us.

02:20:16.242 --> 02:20:19.196
For his anger is but for a moment.

02:20:20.079 --> 02:20:22.700
But his love is for ever.

02:20:22.831 --> 02:20:26.117
Weeping may tarry for a night,

02:20:26.252 --> 02:20:28.790
but joy cometh in the morning.

02:21:16.677 --> 02:21:20.046
