00:04.850 --> 00:07.650
Okay, kids, listen up.
Family meeting.

00:07.689 --> 00:09.620
- Without mom?
- Well, it's about your mom.

00:09.650 --> 00:11.460
We need to talk about her pregnancy.

00:11.490 --> 00:12.720
Oh, I want to go first.

00:12.760 --> 00:16.360
I thought you guys were
gonna stop after one kid.

00:16.390 --> 00:18.500
I was hoping two.

00:18.530 --> 00:19.830
- Three.
- Four.

00:19.860 --> 00:22.830
Anyway...

00:22.870 --> 00:27.400
We have reached that wonderful
moment in your mother's pregnancy.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.740
When she gets uncomfortable.
And when your mother is uncomfortable...

00:30.780 --> 00:33.810
- We're uncomfortable.
- Exactly.

00:33.850 --> 00:36.550
The third trimester is when
your mom gets a little...

00:36.580 --> 00:37.580
- Scary?
- Mean?

00:37.620 --> 00:40.520
- Nasty?
- Icky?

00:40.550 --> 00:43.590
So until further notice,

00:43.620 --> 00:45.660
whenever your mother asks you something,

00:45.690 --> 00:47.830
the answer is "yes."

00:47.860 --> 00:51.660
What if she asks me if my name is Ralph?

00:51.700 --> 00:55.470
- Why would she do that?
- Why wouldn't she do that?

00:57.570 --> 00:59.440
Morning.

00:59.470 --> 01:02.370
- It is a good morning.
- That is so your color.

01:04.739 --> 01:07.740
- What's going on?
- Yes!

01:09.550 --> 01:11.450
- Yes, what?
- Yes!

01:11.480 --> 01:13.550
Er, no!
I mean... no.

01:15.490 --> 01:16.750
My name is Ralph!

01:16.790 --> 01:19.660
What was that all about?

01:19.690 --> 01:22.460
Oh, just Ralph being Ralph.

01:22.490 --> 01:25.360
So how are you feeling, honey?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.760
'Cause you look terrific.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.500
- Shut up, Bob.
- Yes!

01:31.870 --> 01:34.470
Hey, Charlie, the basement is a mess.
After breakfast,

01:34.510 --> 01:37.440
- I want you to go downstairs
and pick up your toys. - No!

01:37.480 --> 01:40.440
What did you say to me?

01:40.480 --> 01:42.650
Yes!

01:42.850 --> 01:44.050

02:41.770 --> 02:44.640
Another great day at super adventure land.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.810
Eight shows in the hot sun
for minimum wage?

02:46.840 --> 02:49.680
- What's so great about it?
- It's sarcasm, Spencer.

02:49.710 --> 02:53.920
Here's another example:
You smell delightful.

02:55.690 --> 02:58.590
You're a little rank yourself,
cinder-smella.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.590
- I'm so glad.
- Me too.Ck together.

03:03.630 --> 03:05.600
You know what we need to do?

03:05.630 --> 03:08.470
- We need to get into.
- Oh, with air conditioning.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.570
Oh, I heard that there's an opening.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.400
In patriotic Plaza to play
George and Martha Washington.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.570
- How do you know that?
- I overheard Betsy Ross.

03:16.610 --> 03:19.680
In the bathroom.
Next to Harriet tubman.

03:19.710 --> 03:22.810
I can always tell when
Abe Lincoln's in the stall.

03:22.850 --> 03:25.520
The hat.

03:25.550 --> 03:29.790
Anyways so, um,
George and Martha Washington.

03:29.820 --> 03:33.460
Were fired because
when they weren't.K.

03:33.490 --> 03:36.560
So the father of our country ctell a lie.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.630
That was very witty.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.500
Thanks.

03:42.530 --> 03:44.870

Somebody's been stealing my newspapers.

03:59.850 --> 04:02.350
Hey, Mrs. dabney.
How are you doing?

04:02.390 --> 04:05.520
Somebody's been stealing my newspapers.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.590
You still get the paper?

04:07.630 --> 04:09.830
Nowadays most people get
their news on the Internet.

04:09.860 --> 04:12.500
The inter what?

04:12.530 --> 04:14.630
The Internet.

04:14.670 --> 04:17.470
You know, the information
super-highway.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.740
Stop talking gibberish.

04:19.769 --> 04:21.709
Where is my newspaper?

04:21.740 --> 04:23.540
We don't have your newspaper.

04:23.570 --> 04:26.680
All right, almost done
with my school proj...

04:29.780 --> 04:32.350
Hey, Mrs. dabney.

04:32.380 --> 04:35.450
I should have known you were
the newspaper thief.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.620
No, I'm not the only guilty one here.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.790
It was a two-man job.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.800
Okay, who wants the sports sec...

04:44.830 --> 04:47.630
Hey, Mrs. dabney.

04:48.770 --> 04:50.700
Tell me more about this Internet.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.740
Bob, we've gotta talk.

04:54.770 --> 04:57.570
You people stole my paper.
What are you gonna to do about it?

04:57.610 --> 04:59.710
- We need to move.
- Works for me.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.750
Here you go.

05:02.780 --> 05:06.420
- What's this? - It's the business
card of a real estate Agent.

05:06.450 --> 05:09.320
I've been carrying that around
since Gabe was born.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.520
I knew this sweet day would come.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.430
Hallelujah!

05:15.460 --> 05:16.830
Been carrying that around too.

05:19.430 --> 05:21.570
Um, honey,

05:21.600 --> 05:23.630
why do we have to move?

05:23.670 --> 05:26.700
I went in the backyard.
There was Cat poop on the lawn.

05:26.740 --> 05:30.510
- I'll start packin'.
- Hold on.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.680
We're have to move because some Cat.

05:32.710 --> 05:35.450
- Did his business on the lawn?
- Oh, let me finish.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.620
Okay, the Cat made me think
that it would be nice.

05:38.650 --> 05:40.420
To have a pet someday.

05:40.450 --> 05:42.550
And then I thought, we
don't have room for a pet!

05:42.590 --> 05:44.720
And then I realized we don't
have room for a baby.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.460
I mean, he or she should
have their own room, right?

05:47.490 --> 05:51.390
Excuse me, I'm not clear... are
we moving or getting a pet?

05:53.730 --> 05:56.370
We need a new house.
What do you think, Bob?

05:56.400 --> 05:57.800
Um, well, we...

05:57.840 --> 06:01.470
Hey, dad, what was that thing
you were telling us earlier?

06:01.510 --> 06:03.640
When mom asks us a question we say...?

06:03.670 --> 06:06.710
I will deal with you later.

06:06.740 --> 06:09.510
No no, it wasn't that.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.480
Honey, look, I understand your feelings.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.650
We do need more room.
You know what? I'm on it.

06:15.690 --> 06:18.620
- Good boy.
- If we are going down the pet road,

06:18.660 --> 06:20.490
could we get a monkey?

06:22.430 --> 06:24.360
'Cause I have this little cowboy hat.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.460
That I have never known what to do with.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.670
Shall we rehearse for our audition, Mr.
Washington?

06:36.440 --> 06:37.710
Hit it, Mrs. Washington.

06:48.690 --> 06:52.390
Many years ago, after the war was won...

06:52.420 --> 06:56.430
- We needed a leader.
- How 'bout Washington?

06:56.460 --> 06:58.360
He was just the man.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.530
To take his country farther.

07:00.570 --> 07:04.530
- And the woman behind him...
- Was his loving wife Martha.

07:06.670 --> 07:08.640
Where are you going, general George?

07:08.670 --> 07:10.640
I'm off to fight at valley forge.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.710
But first I'll lead them 'cross the water.

07:12.740 --> 07:15.350
That's what put him on the quarter!

07:16.550 --> 07:19.320
So long, my dear, I'll miss your smile.

07:19.350 --> 07:20.720
Here, why don't you keep it awhile?

07:25.420 --> 07:27.720
- We're the washingtons.
- The washingtons.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.700
♪ The washa washa washa
washingtons! ♪.

07:37.470 --> 07:40.540
And straight and straight and left and left.

07:40.570 --> 07:42.440
And okay, open your eyes.

07:42.470 --> 07:44.440
- Ooh.
- Ta-dah!

07:46.610 --> 07:49.410
What is it?

07:49.450 --> 07:52.480
- It's the new baby's room!
- Do you love it, mom?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.620
We spent almost an hour on it.

07:54.650 --> 07:58.390
So the baby will be sleeping.

07:58.420 --> 08:01.490
Under the stairs.

08:01.530 --> 08:03.760
Like Harry Potter?

08:03.790 --> 08:06.560
Hey,

08:06.600 --> 08:09.600
Harry Potter, now he had
some fun adventures, huh?

08:09.630 --> 08:12.570
Huh? Say something good
about Harry Potter.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.800
Quiddich!

08:16.570 --> 08:18.680
Honey, look...

08:18.710 --> 08:21.340
You know what? Look,
how easy it's gonna be.

08:21.380 --> 08:23.580
To pull the baby out of the crib, huh?

08:23.610 --> 08:25.720
Almost too easy!

08:29.450 --> 08:31.660
That would never happen in real life.

08:31.690 --> 08:34.789
You've dropped 'em before,
you'll drop 'em again.

08:34.830 --> 08:37.530
Hey, mom, check this out.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.360
If the baby gets fussy,
calm the little munchkin.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.669
With an ocean view.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.600
Hey!

08:45.640 --> 08:48.740
New house, Bob.
Got it?

08:51.840 --> 08:54.810
Uh-oh. Shark!

09:06.390 --> 09:08.730
- What's all this?
- Everything you've ever.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.490
Thrown, shot or fired into my house.

09:16.670 --> 09:19.640
Oh... boy, you were
a disappointment.

09:22.510 --> 09:25.410
Why are you giving all this stuff back?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.680
Gabe, now that you're moving
away, I've been thinking:

09:28.710 --> 09:31.550
You and I have had our differences,

09:31.580 --> 09:35.490
but the truth is you've made
my life more interesting.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.250
You've kept me young.

09:38.290 --> 09:41.290
I haven't done a very good job.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.360
There's that sense of humor
I'll miss so much.

09:49.770 --> 09:52.670
Hey, it's my favorite baseball cap.

09:52.700 --> 09:55.410
Remember when you lost that?

09:55.440 --> 09:58.440
Yeah, I was trying to plant
a stink bomb in your flower bed.

10:02.550 --> 10:04.510
You know, Mrs. dabney,
after all these years,

10:04.550 --> 10:06.620
that's the first nice moment
we've ever shared.

10:08.590 --> 10:10.390
Bye, now.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.470
What are we doing here?
What's the big surprise?

10:22.500 --> 10:25.340
This is your new house!

10:25.370 --> 10:27.600
- What?
- We're really moving?

10:27.640 --> 10:29.470
But I love our old house.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.610
You'll like the new house even more.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.410
- Can't we at least talk about this?
- We just did.

10:35.610 --> 10:38.350
- So we sold our old house already?
- Nope!

10:38.380 --> 10:40.450
Still own that one.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.490
Normally you sell the old house first.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.620
But now we own
two houses. Yay.

10:47.790 --> 10:50.730
And in this house, everyone
gets their own room.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.330
Do I finally get out of the basement?

10:53.360 --> 10:55.370
You sure do.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.470
Uh, here your bedroom is on...

10:58.500 --> 11:00.400
Level b-1!

11:02.340 --> 11:03.440
Ugh, man,

11:03.470 --> 11:06.440
it's kinda hot in here.

11:10.410 --> 11:12.580
Why are you all staring at me?

11:12.620 --> 11:14.720
Why is my cap full of hair?

11:14.750 --> 11:16.720
I know where your cap got it.

11:19.390 --> 11:20.660
Ahh!

11:20.690 --> 11:21.790
Dabney!

11:23.530 --> 11:25.330
I got him.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.370
Charlie, you like your new home, don't you?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.500
No, mommy!

11:34.670 --> 11:36.770
Charlie!

11:47.660 --> 11:49.730
Is something on your mind?

11:49.760 --> 11:52.800
Or should I say <i>not</i> on your mind?

11:52.830 --> 11:55.800
You put hair removal goo in my cap!

11:55.840 --> 11:57.740
That was for stealing my newspapers.

11:57.770 --> 12:01.440
And the funny part is
I got the idea on the Internet.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.510
This isn't over.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.410
Oh, but I think it is.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.810
You're moving away
and I get the last laugh.

12:07.850 --> 12:08.850
Ha ha ha!

12:08.880 --> 12:11.650
No, you're not gonna get the last laugh!

12:11.690 --> 12:14.620
I'm getting the last laugh!
And it's gonna sound like this:

12:14.660 --> 12:17.420
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

12:17.460 --> 12:19.790
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

12:28.540 --> 12:30.500
Ha!

12:31.840 --> 12:33.840
We have a complicated relationship.

12:41.780 --> 12:44.580
Hi.
I just got your text.

12:44.620 --> 12:46.750
- You're moving?
- Yeah.

12:46.790 --> 12:49.560
We are.
I'm kinda sad about it.

12:49.590 --> 12:50.820
I'm gonna miss this place.

12:50.860 --> 12:52.890
Um, well,

12:52.930 --> 12:55.460
here's some more bad news.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.900
Super adventure land called...

12:56.930 --> 12:58.900
Oh, and we didn't get it?

12:58.930 --> 13:02.540
Actually, <i>you</i> didn't get it.

13:02.570 --> 13:06.370
But you did?
Oh, but did you tell them.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.570
That you weren't gonna
do the show without me?

13:10.840 --> 13:13.780
Well, I was gonna,

13:13.810 --> 13:18.450
but it's supposed to be
really hot next week, so...

13:18.490 --> 13:22.420
Oh great.
So I'm stuck kissing a sweaty frog.

13:22.460 --> 13:26.390
- Pretty much, yeah.
- So who's playing Martha Washington?

13:26.430 --> 13:29.660
- Sandy super.
- Who?

13:29.700 --> 13:32.630
Milt super's niece. You know, the guy
who founded super adventure land.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.730
Wait, is Sandy super.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.440
That really cute girl
who's always staring at you.

13:37.470 --> 13:39.640
And asking you out and
pretending I don't exist?

13:39.670 --> 13:42.610
- So you do know her.
- Oh.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.680
Well, maybe the new frog
will be really cute too.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.550
Actually,

13:47.580 --> 13:51.550
they're giving that part to the
guy who runs the tilt-a-whirl.

13:51.590 --> 13:54.650
Greasy Joe?

13:54.690 --> 13:57.720
- Afraid so.
- Don't you have to have teeth.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.630
- To play a frog?
- Afraid not.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.770
Two house payments.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.380
Hey, dad,

14:18.410 --> 14:20.780
can I...

14:20.810 --> 14:24.350
Whoa. What's going on
with youeye?

14:24.380 --> 14:25.720
Your mother has ideas.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.750
Expensive ideas.

14:27.790 --> 14:30.560
That's okay.
I'll just look at the other eye.

14:32.790 --> 14:35.330
So, dad, quick question,

14:35.360 --> 14:37.630
how long do you think it
would take to dig a pit?

14:37.660 --> 14:40.400
- How big a pit?
- Eh, I don't know.

14:40.430 --> 14:42.670
About as tall and as wide
as Mrs. dabney.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.810
Gabe, what are you up to?

14:46.840 --> 14:49.610
- How much do you want to know?
- Is it gonna cost me any money?

14:49.640 --> 14:51.640
- No.
- Happy digging.

14:58.490 --> 15:00.620
Where are you going, general George?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.560
I'm off to fight at valley forge.

15:02.590 --> 15:04.560
But first I'll lead them 'cross the water.

15:04.590 --> 15:07.330
Take me too, I think you oughter.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.370
- Teddy?
- Who's Teddy?

15:14.400 --> 15:15.700
I'm Ben Franklin.

15:15.740 --> 15:19.410
Uh, what are you doing here, Ben?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.740
Yeah, you're not in this show.

15:21.780 --> 15:24.780
She means this part of history.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.580
Oh, George, George,

15:28.620 --> 15:30.750
everyone knows you didn't
go to valley forge.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.550
To save our country.

15:32.590 --> 15:35.620
You went because you and Martha.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.520
Were having ♪ problems.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.660
- What? - So you turned
to your best friend,

15:44.700 --> 15:47.770
Ben Franklin,
who's always been there for you.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.600
- No, he didn't.
- Oh yes, he did.

15:52.810 --> 15:55.710
Then Martha was comforted
by themas Jefferson,

15:55.740 --> 15:58.610
played in this performance by greasy Joe.

16:00.450 --> 16:02.650
Oh Joe!

16:03.650 --> 16:05.520
Joe!

16:05.550 --> 16:08.320
Quit gummin' on that corndog
and get out here!

16:13.660 --> 16:16.400
And that's how America got started.

16:25.510 --> 16:27.710
- C'mon, Charlie.
- No!

16:27.740 --> 16:30.680
- What's going on in here?
- We've got a situation.

16:30.710 --> 16:32.580
Someone is refusing to pack.

16:32.610 --> 16:35.650
Oh, Charlie honey, you have to pack your
toys so we can take them to the new house.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.420
No!
I'm staying!

16:40.420 --> 16:42.760
Yeah, actually I kinda
want to stay here too.

16:42.790 --> 16:45.490
P.J., you're not helping.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.490
But I have so many great
memories at this house.

16:48.530 --> 16:52.630
Like, when I got my head
stuck in the swing set.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.600
Honey, you're gonna get your head stuck.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.770
In lots of places at the new house.

17:00.510 --> 17:01.570
Promise?

17:04.579 --> 17:07.609
I really Hope this one's another girl.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.720
Okay, Charlie, what's it gonna take.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.619
To get you in a new house today?

17:11.650 --> 17:13.490
- Pony.
- Done.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.619
Bob!

17:17.589 --> 17:19.630
Hey, what just happened in there?

17:19.660 --> 17:22.290
Well, I think we found out.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.660
That Sandy's no good at improv.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.470
Teddy, are you really
jealous of Sandy super?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.500
No, why would I be jealous.

17:30.540 --> 17:33.270
Of somebody who's cute and smart.

17:33.310 --> 17:35.340
And rich?

17:35.380 --> 17:38.380
Look, Teddy, you have
nothing to worry about.

17:38.410 --> 17:41.480
There's no one in the world who
I'd rather be with than you.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.650
- Really?
- Really.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.620
George Washington,

17:48.660 --> 17:51.420
you're the best boyfriend I've ever had.

17:52.730 --> 17:56.300
And you're the best girlfriend
I ever had, Ben Franklin.

17:56.330 --> 17:58.400
Oh, come here.

17:58.430 --> 18:00.630
I'm gonna teach you
something about electricity.

18:00.670 --> 18:02.570
Oh yeah.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.280
Well, Charlie, this is it:

18:11.310 --> 18:14.380
Our last few moments on edgewood drive.

18:14.410 --> 18:17.250
I gotta say I'm gonna miss this place.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.290
Come on, Teddy, let's go.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.520
I'll edit that out later.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.530
Well, see you at the new house.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.560
Good luck, Charlie.

18:37.570 --> 18:39.570
Okay.

18:39.610 --> 18:42.370
You know what?
I'll be right out.

18:42.410 --> 18:44.540
I feel like I forgot something.

19:02.530 --> 19:04.460
Welcome home, P.J.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.570
This is where you're going to grow up.

19:10.570 --> 19:13.270
- No-ooo!
- Hey hey.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.640
We are stopping at two, right?

19:18.680 --> 19:21.350
Well, actually...

19:21.380 --> 19:24.420
Aw no.

19:36.360 --> 19:39.500
Gabe is such an easy baby.

19:39.530 --> 19:41.670
I Hope he'll always be like this.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.390
"Then all the little
ducklings found their way home.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.530
And lived
happily ever after."

20:08.560 --> 20:10.600
Aw.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.330
Thank you.

20:20.770 --> 20:23.510
Honey, find what you were looking for?

20:23.540 --> 20:25.810
I did.

20:27.650 --> 20:29.420
We can't move, Bob.

20:30.420 --> 20:31.650
What?

20:33.590 --> 20:36.390
I carried all four kids through that door.

20:37.490 --> 20:39.560
I want to do the same with number five.

20:39.590 --> 20:41.730
What's going on?

20:41.760 --> 20:43.700
We're not moving.

20:43.730 --> 20:47.600
We're not moving!
Hey hey, unpack the truck!

20:47.630 --> 20:50.370
Are you kidding?
That's awesome.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.570
We're staying right here.

20:52.610 --> 20:53.640
In our home.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.670
Come on, people, let's get out of here!

20:55.710 --> 20:57.680
We're not moving.
Mom changed her mind.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.780
What?!

20:59.810 --> 21:03.250
No no no, we have to go!
Right now!

21:03.280 --> 21:04.650
Whoa whoa whoa.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.420
What did you do?

21:06.450 --> 21:09.660
- I didn't do anything.
- Mrs. dabney: <i>Help!</i>

21:09.690 --> 21:11.590
Ignore that.

21:15.630 --> 21:17.300
What's going on?

21:17.330 --> 21:20.500
That little monster covered
my entire porch with glue.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.370
Even the mail.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.740
- Gabe, why did you do that?
- I had to get the last laugh.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.680
Okay, but that's not funny.

21:29.710 --> 21:32.310
It's kinda funny.

21:33.550 --> 21:36.580
- A little help here.
- Okay, hang on, Mrs. dabney.

21:36.620 --> 21:39.280
- We'll get you unstuck.
- I got it.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.350
- Uh...
- Wai...

21:41.390 --> 21:43.360
I don't got it.

21:48.560 --> 21:52.460
Well, Charlie, we're back
to being a one-house family.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.470
A one-home family.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.540
And we couldn't be happier.

21:58.410 --> 22:00.540
I'll edit that out later.

22:00.570 --> 22:04.340
Oh, so Spencer and I were fired.

22:04.380 --> 22:05.680
From super adventure land.

22:05.710 --> 22:07.550
Apparently, Ben Franklin.

22:07.580 --> 22:09.520
Kissing George Washington was deemed.

22:09.550 --> 22:12.380
Historically inaccurate.

22:12.420 --> 22:15.550
Although they did like each other...

22:15.590 --> 22:17.590
A lot.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.660
Hey, guys,

22:19.690 --> 22:22.490
pj got his head stuck
in the swingset again.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.670
Okay.
I'll get my tools.

22:26.700 --> 22:28.630
I'll get the butter.

22:29.670 --> 22:31.600
There's no place like home.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.370
Good luck, Charlie.

22:36.670 --> 22:38.700
<i>Many years ago,</i> <i>the founders</i>

22:38.740 --> 22:42.510
<i>of super adventure land</i> <i>gathered
for a very</i> <i>important meeting.</i>

22:42.540 --> 22:44.940
Gentlemen, we've built
this beautiful theme park,

22:44.980 --> 22:46.880
now all we need is a name.

22:46.910 --> 22:51.750
I know. We'll call it
land of adventure super.

22:51.780 --> 22:55.890
Of course you'd put your
name first, Richard land.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.720
Well then, what do you
suggest, Frank adventure?

22:58.760 --> 23:00.790
Something that rolls right off the tongue.

23:00.830 --> 23:05.700
"Adventure of super land."

23:05.730 --> 23:07.730
That's not bad.

23:07.910 --> 23:10.670
Not bad.
Let me make one slight adjustment.

23:10.670 --> 23:15.340
We'll call it: "Super land of adventure."

23:15.340 --> 23:17.200
Gentlemen.

23:17.410 --> 23:20.240
Terrible news! We've just got this telegram.

23:20.710 --> 23:22.730
Arthur of...

23:22.730 --> 23:24.730
Is dead.

23:26.070 --> 23:27.980
Of's been offed?

23:29.050 --> 23:30.900
I'm afraid so.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.380
With art of gone, it's down
to just the three of us:

23:34.380 --> 23:37.690
Super, adventure, land.

23:39.140 --> 23:42.060
Betty, put on a pot of coffee.
We're gonna be here awhile.
