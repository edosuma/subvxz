03:26.900 --> 03:29.984
They're going mad, sir.
It's the students.

03:32.989 --> 03:34.530
All right. Let them in.

03:48.835 --> 03:50.329
- Swine!
- Beasts!

04:10.019 --> 04:13.553
- Into the valley of death...
- Into the jaws of hell...

04:13.647 --> 04:15.770
..rode the 600!

04:18.735 --> 04:20.560
Hey, hey. Ease up.

04:22.279 --> 04:24.188
You're sitting on my cloak.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.484
- Something up down below?
- Not a sausage.

04:28.576 --> 04:31.067
- Ah. Here you are, Terry.
- Thank you.

05:18.744 --> 05:20.404
I can't see him anywhere.

05:20.495 --> 05:22.487
- Programs.
- Oh. Two, please.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.533
One here. Thanks, pal.

05:28.001 --> 05:29.874
Quite a turnout down below.

05:29.961 --> 05:32.961
Old Palmer's music
had better be good.

05:33.047 --> 05:36.629
Boronskaja wouldn't dance
the leading role if it wasn't.

05:38.927 --> 05:42.461
- Boro who?
- Who exactly is Boronskaja?

05:42.555 --> 05:46.848
Since you've stood in a queue for
six hours waiting to see her dance...

05:46.934 --> 05:49.638
Not to see anybody. To hear.

05:50.770 --> 05:53.889
Have you ever heard
of Professor Palmer?

05:53.981 --> 05:56.020
- Never.
- You will.

05:57.776 --> 06:01.476
The program says, "Heart Of Fire,
music by Andrew Palmer."

06:01.571 --> 06:05.070
- Our professor.
- Boro-what's-her-name best be good.

06:05.157 --> 06:08.905
She's hardly likely
to be anything else.

06:19.378 --> 06:22.164
There he is. Palmer!

06:49.694 --> 06:50.974
Livy!

06:51.070 --> 06:53.739
Come on, Livy!

06:55.199 --> 06:56.942
We know him.

07:59.044 --> 08:01.830
Do you remember
my Cytherean Rhapsody?

08:01.921 --> 08:04.542
- Forget it.
- That's it. Your rhapsody.

08:04.632 --> 08:07.549
- It must be an accident.
- Did you show him?

08:07.634 --> 08:10.588
- I show him all my work.
- You think he lifted it?

08:10.679 --> 08:12.007
Shh!

09:17.484 --> 09:19.642
She's a great patron of the arts.

09:31.496 --> 09:36.157
Vicky. Vicky.

09:49.261 --> 09:51.716
Vicky.

09:51.805 --> 09:53.844
Lermontov's coming.

10:04.649 --> 10:08.729
- I say! That's yours, too, isn't it?
- Yes.

11:13.665 --> 11:15.373
Steady, old boy.

11:16.626 --> 11:18.334
Well, what are you waiting for?

11:18.419 --> 11:19.961
Shh!

11:28.720 --> 11:32.005
Please, do you mind?

11:34.391 --> 11:36.348
Oh, really!

11:47.568 --> 11:52.395
Dear Professor, we're very proud of
you. I hope you're proud of yourself.

11:52.489 --> 11:54.730
You're too kind. Monsieur Lermontov.

11:54.824 --> 11:57.990
- We meet the great man at last.
- Enchanté, madame.

11:58.077 --> 12:01.077
I never imagined I'd succeed
in getting you here.

12:01.163 --> 12:03.239
I must be a very clever woman.

12:13.924 --> 12:17.209
If some fat harridan
is going to sing, I must go.

12:17.302 --> 12:20.919
- I can't bear amateurs.
- Neither can Lady Neston.

12:21.013 --> 12:25.141
- What do you mean?
- She has a niece who dances.

12:25.225 --> 12:26.505
Professionally.

12:33.065 --> 12:34.263
Hello, Professor.

12:34.358 --> 12:38.936
Now, please don't get up,
Mr Lermontov.

12:39.028 --> 12:42.444
Now, are you prepared for a surprise?

12:42.531 --> 12:45.366
Do you mean a surprise or a shock?

12:45.451 --> 12:51.203
Well, to take the plunge,
I've asked my niece to dance tonight.

12:51.289 --> 12:53.958
What would you call that?

12:54.041 --> 12:55.204
A shock.

12:56.877 --> 13:00.577
Oh, well,
you're certainly very candid.

13:00.672 --> 13:02.296
You know, Mr Lermontov,

13:02.382 --> 13:06.793
I wouldn't dream of boring you
with the performance of an amateur.

13:06.884 --> 13:10.668
My niece has been dancing leading
roles for some time now.

13:10.763 --> 13:13.088
The critics think highly of her work.

13:13.181 --> 13:17.048
How would you define ballet,
Lady Neston?

13:17.143 --> 13:22.385
Well...one might call it
the poetry of motion, perhaps, or...

13:22.481 --> 13:26.810
One might. But for me,
it is a great deal more.

13:26.901 --> 13:29.392
For me, it is a religion.

13:29.487 --> 13:31.526
And one doesn't really care

13:31.614 --> 13:38.149
to see one's religion practised
in an atmosphere such as this.

13:38.244 --> 13:40.284
I hope you understand.

13:43.499 --> 13:45.575
Attractive brute.

14:23.156 --> 14:26.655
- I'll have a champagne cocktail.
- Yes, sir.

14:26.743 --> 14:30.028
- Champagne cocktail, please.
- Yes, madam.

14:33.624 --> 14:37.787
Do you know at parties everybody
is supposed to be very happy?

14:40.463 --> 14:43.333
But perhaps you dislike them
as much as I do.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.753
Still, I think
it might have been worse.

14:47.844 --> 14:51.627
- Do you?
- It very nearly was much worse.

14:51.722 --> 14:53.880
- Oh?
- Thank you.

14:53.974 --> 14:57.509
We were to be treated
to a little dancing exhibition.

14:57.602 --> 15:00.010
But now we're to be spared
that horror.

15:00.104 --> 15:03.140
Mr Lermontov, I am that horror.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.640
Mmm...

15:09.529 --> 15:11.568
It's a bit late for apologies.

15:11.656 --> 15:13.565
Yes, a little late, I think.

15:15.409 --> 15:17.615
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

15:17.703 --> 15:20.620
But you're not sorry
I didn't dance, are you?

15:20.705 --> 15:23.706
- May I ask why?
- Because, my dear Miss...

15:23.791 --> 15:24.870
Victoria Page.

15:24.959 --> 15:27.876
Miss Page, if I accept
an invitation to a party,

15:27.961 --> 15:30.630
I do not expect to find myself
at an audition.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.256
Yes. You're quite right.

15:40.346 --> 15:43.346
Why do you want to dance?

15:45.392 --> 15:47.016
Why do you want to live?

15:48.937 --> 15:53.313
Well, I don't know exactly why,
but, uh...I must.

15:54.525 --> 15:56.398
That's my answer, too.

16:00.238 --> 16:01.436
Come with me.

16:01.531 --> 16:03.902
- Where to?
- We're going to talk.

16:03.991 --> 16:07.691
- But I don't want to talk to you.
- Don't worry. I'll do the talking.

16:22.632 --> 16:25.336
Can I see
Mr Lermontov now, please?

16:25.426 --> 16:26.754
What is it, Dimitri?

16:26.844 --> 16:30.461
A young man called Craster.
He's been here a hundred times.

16:30.555 --> 16:33.639
I've told him you're asleep.
He will not believe me.

16:33.725 --> 16:37.175
Either you're a bad liar
or he's a man of good sense.

16:37.269 --> 16:39.594
Show him in and serve breakfast.

16:42.899 --> 16:44.441
Mr Craster.

17:02.581 --> 17:04.656
What can I do for you, Mr Craster?

17:04.750 --> 17:07.371
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr Lermontov,

17:07.461 --> 17:10.330
but it's a matter
of great importance to me.

17:10.421 --> 17:11.880
Yes?

17:11.964 --> 17:14.420
I wrote you a letter, a silly letter.

17:14.508 --> 17:17.128
I'd like to have it back
before you read it.

17:18.678 --> 17:20.089
I see.

17:23.933 --> 17:25.391
That's the one.

17:27.185 --> 17:30.850
Unfortunately, Mr Craster,
I have already read this letter.

17:30.939 --> 17:32.349
Oh.

17:34.609 --> 17:38.392
- Mr Lermontov, please.
- You are Professor Palmer's pupil?.

17:38.487 --> 17:42.401
You say you've written a
string quartet and a piano concerto.

17:42.490 --> 17:43.486
Yes.

17:44.617 --> 17:46.444
Very interesting.

17:46.535 --> 17:48.943
Would you care to play me something?

17:49.038 --> 17:51.706
Something of your own, I mean.

17:52.832 --> 17:55.038
Of course, if...if you wish it.

18:06.844 --> 18:09.928
This is a study
I wrote for the piano.

18:14.391 --> 18:16.633
But I'm thinking of orchestrating it

18:16.727 --> 18:19.513
and putting it into an opera
I'm working on.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.585
But are you finished already?
It was very interesting.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.968
Hope I haven't ruined your breakfast.

19:03.099 --> 19:04.428
By the way...

19:04.517 --> 19:08.929
I need a new coach for the orchestra.
Would the idea interest you?

19:10.898 --> 19:12.855
Would it...interest?

19:12.941 --> 19:17.852
I shouldn't be able to pay much.
£8 a week and expenses.

19:19.905 --> 19:22.361
It would be absolutely marvellous.

19:22.449 --> 19:25.900
Get some breakfast
and come over to Covent Garden.

19:25.994 --> 19:28.200
Thank you.

19:28.287 --> 19:30.991
And your letter, Mr Craster.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.784
If you take my advice...

19:38.879 --> 19:42.128
you'll destroy it immediately
and forget about it.

19:46.635 --> 19:49.719
The Heart Of Fire
is your work, isn't it?

19:51.431 --> 19:53.886
These things happen unintentionally.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.433
I know. That's why...

19:55.518 --> 19:59.764
That's why it is worth remembering
that it is much more disheartening

19:59.855 --> 20:01.894
to have to steal

20:01.982 --> 20:05.184
than to be stolen from, hmm?

20:08.571 --> 20:10.563
Good morning.

20:23.667 --> 20:28.162
# As I walk the long,
cloudy, stormy night... #

20:33.008 --> 20:38.049
# He went to Covent Garden
in the morning... #

20:38.137 --> 20:39.335
What a corker.

20:44.810 --> 20:48.391
Course I tried to get her.
Tried to get her twice. Ta-ra.

20:48.479 --> 20:50.767
- Here you are, son.
- Thank you.

20:50.856 --> 20:52.682
Hey, you'll pardon me.

20:52.774 --> 20:55.015
This is the way to the stage,
isn't it?

20:55.109 --> 20:57.018
- Name?
- Julian Craster.

20:57.111 --> 20:59.898
- What name?
- Julian Craster.

20:59.988 --> 21:01.151
Not on my list.

21:09.496 --> 21:11.952
- Lunch, Irina?
- Yes.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.831
But I have an appointment...

21:13.917 --> 21:17.001
I'm sorry, but I've got my job
to look after.

21:17.086 --> 21:20.205
- Good morning, George.
- Oh, bonjour, madame.

21:20.297 --> 21:21.791
How is Madame George?

21:21.882 --> 21:25.926
Oh, she's la très jalouse.
Very jalouse.

21:26.010 --> 21:30.173
It's that bit of a photograph
we had took together. Cold drink?

21:30.264 --> 21:33.715
They been looking all over London
for you this morning.

21:33.809 --> 21:36.097
That's what I said.

21:36.186 --> 21:37.845
How much longer must I wait?

21:37.937 --> 21:40.392
- I'll send for the SM.
- What is your name?

21:41.941 --> 21:43.185
Julian Craster.

21:43.275 --> 21:46.311
I have an appointment
with Mr Lermontov.

21:46.403 --> 21:48.525
Julian Kwis...Kweiss...

21:48.613 --> 21:50.321
- Craster.
- Kwaster.

21:50.406 --> 21:53.905
Well, George, if this young man
is invited by Mr Lermontov,

21:53.993 --> 21:56.115
you can pass him, yes?

21:56.203 --> 21:59.737
Ça va by me, madame. Ça va by me.

21:59.831 --> 22:01.788
Follow me, young man.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.701
- Est-ce que vous...?
- Comment?

22:07.795 --> 22:08.957
Are you a dancer?

22:09.046 --> 22:12.130
Yes...at night.
Not very much in the morning.

22:12.215 --> 22:14.338
I don't know much about the ballet.

22:14.426 --> 22:18.126
- You are artiste?
- Yes. I'm a composer.

22:18.220 --> 22:21.340
Ah! And you wish to see who?

22:21.431 --> 22:23.554
Well, I'm afraid I'm not quite sure.

22:23.642 --> 22:26.595
They are all there. Take your choice.

22:35.318 --> 22:37.357
Excuse me. Who's in charge?

22:37.445 --> 22:40.232
There's five or six of them
that thinks they are.

22:40.323 --> 22:43.608
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- Don't ask me.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.657
I'm just somebody's mother.

22:45.744 --> 22:49.243
That doesn't mean much around here,
I can tell you.

22:52.416 --> 22:56.413
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- In charge of what?

22:56.503 --> 23:00.251
- Mr Lermontov asked me to come.
- Why?

23:00.339 --> 23:03.091
- He's engaged me.
- Not as a dancer, I hope.

23:03.175 --> 23:04.373
No.

23:04.468 --> 23:06.959
Allons, mes enfants! Au boulot!

23:08.096 --> 23:09.507
And...

23:13.017 --> 23:15.590
Well, Mr Ratov,
Mr Ljubov wants it moved.

23:15.686 --> 23:19.054
It is on the plan,
and there it stays.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.222
Well, if you say so.

23:21.315 --> 23:23.556
- Merci.
- Morning, madame.

23:27.195 --> 23:32.401
Ah, here comes the great
Boronskaja at last.

23:32.491 --> 23:35.906
And today she's only
43 minutes late.

23:35.994 --> 23:39.658
Am I supposed to congratulate
myself on that?

23:41.832 --> 23:44.619
I tell you, Irina,
my patience is at an end.

23:44.709 --> 23:47.200
I shall go to Lermontov
and explain to him

23:47.295 --> 23:50.829
how no theatre is big enough
to hold both you and me!

23:50.923 --> 23:52.797
I might as well start packing.

23:52.883 --> 23:57.046
Oh, there's no hurry. He might choose
to dispense with MY services.

23:57.137 --> 23:58.631
He is quite crazy enough.

23:58.721 --> 24:02.849
But if we go, we go together,
Grischa, darling. Promise?

24:02.933 --> 24:04.392
Coo, Buschka.

24:05.519 --> 24:08.603
- Who are you?
- Victoria Page.

24:08.688 --> 24:11.439
I expect Mr Lermontov
has spoken about me.

24:11.524 --> 24:14.228
- He's invited me here...
- No, this is too much.

24:14.318 --> 24:16.939
He invites them, I teach them.

24:17.029 --> 24:19.566
I get rid of them, he forgets them.

24:19.656 --> 24:21.529
And now, unhappy girl,

24:21.616 --> 24:26.822
please go to the far corner of the
stage, where you'll meet five others

24:26.912 --> 24:32.072
to whom Mr Lermontov has also
extended his hospitality.

24:43.925 --> 24:45.965
Quiet, please!

24:49.096 --> 24:52.216
I want to rehearse the first act
of Heart Of Fire.

24:52.308 --> 24:55.723
Will everybody not concerned
leave the stage, please?

24:55.811 --> 24:58.977
Right-o, boys,
set act one. Hurry.

25:03.233 --> 25:06.567
Is that so? Well, I agree.

25:09.364 --> 25:11.570
Where are you going, my dear?

25:11.657 --> 25:13.863
I'm going to talk to Mr Lermontov.

25:13.951 --> 25:17.533
Wouldn't it be better to wait
until after rehearsal?.

25:17.621 --> 25:20.290
Oh, no. You see,
I know him personally.

25:20.373 --> 25:23.907
Ah, well, that makes
all the difference. Of course.

25:24.001 --> 25:26.159
- Ratov...
- Yes, Boris?

25:26.253 --> 25:28.874
Stay where you are. I'll come up.

25:38.055 --> 25:41.719
- Good morning, Mr Lermontov.
- Good morning, Ratov.

25:41.808 --> 25:45.223
We must do something
about this piece.

25:45.311 --> 25:48.975
The girls have hardly room to move.
Ljubov was right.

25:49.064 --> 25:51.519
- Aha! Ljubov...
- Ljubov is always right.

25:51.608 --> 25:54.099
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.

25:54.193 --> 25:58.569
Well, well, well. Then take it away.
Take it away.

26:04.409 --> 26:08.537
Well, you see, my dear,
Mr Lermontov is a very busy man.

26:08.621 --> 26:13.164
Now, why don't you go and wait
over there with the others?

26:13.250 --> 26:15.539
Ivan! Are you ready?

26:15.627 --> 26:17.002
Yes, I will.

26:17.087 --> 26:19.412
- Sergei Sergeievitch?
- Yes?

26:19.506 --> 26:23.254
Are you acquainted with the
works or person of Julian Craster,

26:23.342 --> 26:24.920
composer and conductor?

26:25.010 --> 26:27.049
- No.
- Nor I.

26:27.137 --> 26:29.972
Which proves how sadly
we lag behind the times,

26:30.056 --> 26:31.965
for here he is in our midst.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.595
Lermontov has engaged him
this morning.

27:07.963 --> 27:09.837
Rond de jambe... E.

27:32.775 --> 27:34.269
Class dismissed.

28:07.721 --> 28:10.426
No, gentlemen. Figure 29, sing.

28:10.515 --> 28:14.429
I think that will do.

28:14.519 --> 28:16.511
Thank you, gentlemen.

28:16.604 --> 28:20.897
The brass could do with
your attention, Craster. Tomorrow.

28:35.661 --> 28:39.076
Gentlemen, I'm very sorry to bring
you here so early.

28:40.498 --> 28:44.163
But I've been in front
for this ballet more than once

28:44.251 --> 28:45.710
and I really must...

28:49.965 --> 28:52.965
There are one or two things
I really must put right.

28:53.051 --> 28:56.715
So, um, Heart Of Fire.
Overture, please.

28:58.764 --> 29:00.803
From the beginning.

29:02.100 --> 29:06.845
Oh, by the way, trumpets,
at two bars before figure two,

29:06.937 --> 29:09.938
have you got an E natural?.

29:10.023 --> 29:11.648
No. I've got an E flat.

29:11.733 --> 29:15.351
Ah. Makes all the difference.
Should be E natural.

29:15.445 --> 29:17.567
Right. From the beginning.

29:30.165 --> 29:32.834
I know it's hard
to get your lips set this early,

29:32.918 --> 29:35.325
but we ought to be able
to come in together.

29:35.420 --> 29:38.539
Even more pianissimo. Less strings.

29:38.631 --> 29:40.504
A, oboe.

29:47.763 --> 29:49.802
From the beginning, please.

30:18.205 --> 30:20.826
- That's nice.
- Mr Craster!

30:22.334 --> 30:27.458
What is going on?
Have you taken leave of your senses?

30:27.546 --> 30:32.172
Do you realise that by calling
the orchestra early we must pay them?

30:33.843 --> 30:36.334
And why are you rehearsing
Heart Of Fire?

30:36.429 --> 30:40.129
Did I ever ask you to do that?
Tell me. I'm interested.

30:40.224 --> 30:43.474
I'm sure Mr Lermontov
will be interested, too.

30:45.270 --> 30:47.974
- Well?.
- I like it.

30:48.064 --> 30:53.188
You like it? You must also like the
National Anthem and the Marseillaise.

30:53.277 --> 30:56.230
I hope you won't summon
the full orchestra at dawn

30:56.321 --> 30:58.397
to practise those noble melodies?

30:59.782 --> 31:02.273
I leave this young man to you,
Lermontov.

31:02.368 --> 31:07.194
After all, he is your discovery,
not mine.

31:07.288 --> 31:10.454
Mr Craster, I must ask you
to exercise in future

31:10.540 --> 31:13.790
a little more control
over your natural ambitions.

31:13.876 --> 31:18.372
And why you've chosen Heart Of Fire
for this early-morning escapade...

31:18.464 --> 31:20.171
Good morning, gentlemen...

31:20.257 --> 31:23.210
..is a mystery
I shall never hope to solve.

31:23.301 --> 31:26.420
May I see that wrong note
in the score, please?

31:29.473 --> 31:33.221
Hmm. However,
there are passages in Heart Of Fire

31:33.310 --> 31:37.010
which no one need be ashamed of.

31:37.105 --> 31:38.931
Thank you, Mr Lermontov.

31:50.741 --> 31:53.991
- Good morning, Miss Page.
- Good morning, Edmund.

31:54.077 --> 31:56.615
- Is Lord Oldham with you?
- Yes, miss.

31:56.704 --> 31:58.744
Be careful, miss.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.913
- Good morning, Peter.
- Hello, Vicky.

32:03.002 --> 32:05.243
- What are you doing here?
- What are you?

32:05.337 --> 32:09.251
Having lunch with Boris Lermontov,
the fellow who runs the ballet.

32:09.340 --> 32:12.092
- Oh. Business or pleasure?
- A bit of both.

32:12.176 --> 32:14.049
Are you shopping or slumming?

32:14.136 --> 32:18.299
Don't worry, Grischa.
I'll bring her back at three o'clock.

32:19.516 --> 32:22.052
- How are you, madame?
- How are you?

32:22.142 --> 32:25.261
Hello, Peter.
I hope we haven't kept you waiting.

32:25.353 --> 32:26.728
No, not at all.

32:26.812 --> 32:30.347
- Boris, meet my friend Vicky Page.
- How do you do?

32:33.151 --> 32:35.274
Can we give you a lift anywhere?

32:35.361 --> 32:38.113
- No, thank you, Peter.
- Excuse me, Miss Page.

32:41.325 --> 32:48.287
Who? Victoria Page?
yes, she may dance.

33:08.556 --> 33:10.679
( # Swan Lake )

35:03.068 --> 35:05.689
Good morning, my dear young ladies.

35:05.779 --> 35:08.067
I hope I find you all very well.

35:08.156 --> 35:11.240
There are one or two things
I would like to say.

35:11.325 --> 35:14.528
As you know, the ballet's
leaving Saturday for Paris.

35:14.620 --> 35:19.696
I can't imagine anything more
enchanting than inviting all of you,

35:19.791 --> 35:22.957
but I'm afraid this pleasure
must be denied me.

35:23.043 --> 35:26.412
To those whom we must
regretfully leave behind,

35:26.505 --> 35:30.418
I'd like to say just this -
please don't be discouraged.

35:30.508 --> 35:35.003
The fact that we can't take you
doesn't mean that you're bad dancers.

35:35.095 --> 35:38.096
It just means that
we haven't got enough room.

35:38.181 --> 35:40.672
Please step out Miss Faye,
Miss Banes,

35:40.767 --> 35:42.676
Miss Hardiman and Miss Laughlin.

35:47.981 --> 35:49.605
Yes.

35:49.691 --> 35:53.605
I thank you four ladies for
the hard work you've done this year.

35:53.694 --> 35:57.229
- Mr Ljubov echoes my gratitude.
- Mmmm.

35:57.322 --> 36:01.070
Maybe next year, we shall
meet you again. Good morning.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.447
Vicky, he means us!

37:40.616 --> 37:44.993
Listen... Mes amis...

37:45.788 --> 37:48.823
I am fiancée. I get married!

37:50.416 --> 37:52.539
My dear child!

37:52.627 --> 37:56.754
All my love and best wishes
for your happiness.

38:03.761 --> 38:08.755
I wish you the greatest happiness
with your new partner.

38:08.849 --> 38:12.383
- Merci. Grischa? Where is Grischa?
- I'm here, Irina!

38:12.477 --> 38:14.137
Darling, do you hate me?

38:14.228 --> 38:18.936
I could never hate you, Irina,
but how can I ever forgive you?

38:19.024 --> 38:21.147
You will forgive me, that I know.

38:21.234 --> 38:24.400
Don't quarrel with your husband
as much as me.

38:24.487 --> 38:28.270
Where is Boris Lermontov?
He has nothing to say to me?

38:30.200 --> 38:31.825
Boris!

38:35.413 --> 38:39.196
He has...no heart, that man.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.688
Entrez!

39:21.910 --> 39:26.286
- Mr Craster, I have a job for you.
- Good!

39:26.372 --> 39:31.163
Do I understand you have not been
altogether very happy with us so far?

39:31.251 --> 39:33.824
- Well, I...
- Well, what?

39:33.920 --> 39:38.297
Coaching an orchestra is not exactly
a young composer's dream, is it?

39:38.382 --> 39:43.209
I'm afraid the job I have may not be
a young composer's dream, either.

39:43.303 --> 39:48.260
Still, I hope you do not consider it
entirely unworthy of your talent.

39:52.811 --> 39:57.805
The ballet of The Red Shoes is from
a fairy tale by Hans Andersen...

40:03.027 --> 40:05.482
..pair of red shoes.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.109
Oh, I beg your pardon?

40:11.784 --> 40:17.240
The ballet of The Red Shoes is from
a fairy tale by Hans Andersen.

40:17.331 --> 40:21.375
It is the story of a girl
who is devoured by an ambition

40:21.459 --> 40:24.413
to attend a dance
in a pair of red shoes.

40:24.504 --> 40:26.911
She gets the shoes, goes to the dance

40:27.006 --> 40:29.164
and at first, she's very happy.

40:30.801 --> 40:35.960
At the end of the evening,
she gets tired and wants to go home.

40:38.140 --> 40:41.556
But the red shoes...

40:41.643 --> 40:44.050
are not tired.

40:44.145 --> 40:47.229
In fact, the red shoes
are never tired.

40:47.315 --> 40:52.688
They dance her out into the streets,
over the mountains and valleys,

40:52.778 --> 40:56.442
through fields and forests,
through night and day.

40:59.575 --> 41:02.694
Time rushes by. Love rushes by.

41:04.204 --> 41:06.243
Life rushes by.

41:07.790 --> 41:10.957
But the red shoes...dance on.

41:11.043 --> 41:13.368
What happens in the end?

41:13.462 --> 41:16.249
- In the end, she dies.
- Yes. I remember.

41:16.339 --> 41:18.296
The music is by Felipe Beltran.

41:18.383 --> 41:22.130
He did it for us last year
during our South American tour.

41:22.218 --> 41:26.511
You'll find some passages marked with
a blue pencil. They are bad.

41:26.597 --> 41:31.305
I would like to see what you can do
in the way of a little rewriting.

41:31.393 --> 41:34.097
- Oh.
- You can take your time.

41:34.187 --> 41:36.144
- There's no hurry.
- Thank you.

41:36.230 --> 41:38.472
- On vous attend.

41:38.565 --> 41:40.724
Oui, je viens.

41:40.817 --> 41:42.228
Thank you.

42:27.649 --> 42:32.357
Ah, look at our Boronskaja.
She's in wonderful form tonight.

42:32.445 --> 42:35.777
I'm not interested in Boronskaja's
form any more.

42:35.863 --> 42:39.563
Nor with any prima ballerina
imbecile enough to get married.

42:39.658 --> 42:43.157
- Oh, come now, Boris.
- She's out. Finished.

42:49.041 --> 42:51.614
You cannot have it both ways.

42:51.710 --> 42:55.707
The dancer who relies upon the
doubtful comforts of human love...

42:56.422 --> 42:59.376
will never be a great dancer.

42:59.466 --> 43:00.925
Never!

43:11.143 --> 43:15.970
That is all very pure and fine,
but you can't alter human nature.

43:16.064 --> 43:19.397
No? I think you can do
even better than that.

43:19.483 --> 43:20.859
You can ignore it.

43:48.633 --> 43:50.709
Boris!

43:50.802 --> 43:52.296
Adieu.

43:55.638 --> 43:57.262
Well, Irina,

43:57.348 --> 44:01.096
now you'll be able to sleep
as long as you like

44:01.185 --> 44:06.012
and eat sweets all day
and go to parties every night.

44:06.105 --> 44:09.355
And you, now you will be calm.

44:09.442 --> 44:11.350
The class will start on time.

44:11.443 --> 44:15.986
No more shouting. No more
hysteria backstage. No more...

44:16.072 --> 44:18.064
No more...Irina.

44:42.094 --> 44:44.170
Oh, Monsieur Lermontov!

44:56.064 --> 44:57.309
Miss Page.

44:59.984 --> 45:03.898
- Are you very tired?
- Yes, thank you.

45:03.988 --> 45:05.648
I mean, I'm not very tired.

45:05.739 --> 45:08.609
Monsieur, je vous présente
Miss Victoria Page.

45:08.700 --> 45:12.399
Monsieur Boudin,
le directeur général de l'opéra.

45:12.494 --> 45:16.242
- Monsieur Rideaut.
- Enchanté, mademoiselle.

45:16.331 --> 45:20.873
You have already visited Monte Carlo,
mademoiselle?

45:20.960 --> 45:22.751
Yes, I was here last season.

45:22.836 --> 45:27.296
- Then you know the Hôtel de Paris.
- Yes, but I believe I'm staying...

45:27.382 --> 45:30.584
Hôtel de Paris.
You'll be very comfortable.

45:45.772 --> 45:49.639
La voiture de Monsieur Lermontov
vous attend, Miss Page.

45:57.074 --> 45:58.900
Bon soir, mademoiselle.

47:04.338 --> 47:06.165
Montez, mademoiselle.

48:22.070 --> 48:25.106
You look dressed up
for a conference.

48:25.197 --> 48:27.355
Hello. Is there a conference on?

48:27.449 --> 48:30.533
Yes. They're all arguing.
I've been here since seven.

48:31.578 --> 48:33.202
There you are, Miss Page.

48:33.288 --> 48:35.114
Will you come in here, please?

48:45.631 --> 48:49.759
I was just going out, Mr Lermontov,
when I got your message.

48:59.143 --> 49:00.719
Miss Page...

49:01.894 --> 49:06.639
I've asked you to come here tonight
because we're preparing a new ballet,

49:07.941 --> 49:10.182
and I've decided
to give you a chance

49:10.276 --> 49:13.312
and let you dance
the principal part in it.

49:13.404 --> 49:16.855
But there's one thing
I must tell you at once.

49:16.949 --> 49:21.409
My belief in your possibilities
is not shared by my colleagues here.

49:24.538 --> 49:27.907
However, it is hardly
necessary for me to add

49:28.000 --> 49:30.621
that whatever their personal belief,

49:30.710 --> 49:32.999
they will all give you their best.

49:33.087 --> 49:35.792
The rest, of course, is up to you.

49:36.924 --> 49:39.249
Well, Miss Page...that's all.

49:40.385 --> 49:43.255
We shall start work
early tomorrow morning.

49:43.346 --> 49:47.213
I suggest you forget all about
your party and go home to bed.

49:48.225 --> 49:50.052
Yes, I will.

49:54.814 --> 49:56.853
And Miss Page?

49:59.193 --> 50:01.944
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

50:07.241 --> 50:09.115
Well, what happened?

50:10.327 --> 50:13.743
- I've got a part in a new ballet.
- New? What ballet?

50:15.123 --> 50:17.448
The Red Shoes!

50:20.502 --> 50:22.708
Now, listen to this. It's impossible.

50:23.838 --> 50:27.253
Well, I couldn't rewrite
that bit, could I?

50:27.341 --> 50:29.878
- Why not?
- You didn't blue-pencil it.

50:29.968 --> 50:32.755
Horrors like that
speak for themselves.

50:32.845 --> 50:35.383
In fact, I had some ideas about that.

50:35.473 --> 50:38.259
Where are they, dear fellow?
We need a score!

50:38.350 --> 50:40.307
If you'll allow me.

50:44.355 --> 50:46.229
Well, it's the church scene.

50:46.315 --> 50:50.608
Get rid of this sentimental hymn
and take a four-square chorale.

50:50.694 --> 50:52.520
Something like this.

50:59.952 --> 51:04.079
Then I thought all the way through,
a church bell coming in.

51:14.214 --> 51:17.214
All this on the strings.

51:21.011 --> 51:23.418
Then as the priest appears,
the brass.

51:31.812 --> 51:34.765
Shall I play you
The Dance of the Red Shoes?

51:41.236 --> 51:43.940
Thank you, Mr Craster. Thank you.

51:47.866 --> 51:51.365
I want you to change everything.
I want a new score.

51:53.079 --> 51:55.155
There you are, Mr Lermontov.

51:56.082 --> 51:58.407
And where's the orchestration?

51:58.500 --> 52:00.908
- When do you want it?
- Yesterday.

52:01.003 --> 52:03.161
You wanted to work. Go home and work.

52:03.254 --> 52:05.710
I don't want to see you
till it's done.

52:05.798 --> 52:07.707
You won't!

52:31.737 --> 52:33.813
Why aren't you in bed?

52:33.905 --> 52:37.440
- Oh, you gave me quite a fright.
- I meant to.

52:41.537 --> 52:43.862
Why aren't you in bed?

52:43.956 --> 52:47.822
I was much too excited to sleep,
so here I am.

52:47.917 --> 52:50.538
- Are you? I haven't seen you.
- Thank you.

52:50.628 --> 52:53.034
By the way,
you haven't seen me, either.

52:53.129 --> 52:56.628
- Has he sent you to bed, too?
- No.

52:56.715 --> 53:00.962
I'm just working on the score
of my new ballet, The Red Shoes.

53:01.053 --> 53:02.879
Is that my ballet, too?

53:04.013 --> 53:05.638
Yes, I suppose it is.

53:22.195 --> 53:25.481
I wonder what it feels like
to wake up in the morning

53:25.573 --> 53:27.115
and find oneself famous.

53:27.200 --> 53:31.113
You're not likely to know
if you stay here talking much longer.

53:31.203 --> 53:34.903
- So, good luck.
- Good luck.

54:26.124 --> 54:28.246
She's putting too much into it.

54:28.334 --> 54:30.575
Why don't you tell her, Grischa?

54:30.669 --> 54:32.412
Mind your own business.

54:33.547 --> 54:37.330
She has the dance with me and
the dance at the fair earlier.

54:37.425 --> 54:41.636
And the big stuff coming up.
She can't dance everything full out.

54:41.720 --> 54:45.420
- She ought to know that.
- How do you expect her to know it,

54:45.515 --> 54:48.718
if you never danced full out
before opening night?

54:55.107 --> 54:58.143
Here are the designs
for the costumes, Boris.

54:58.234 --> 55:00.855
One moment.
Sit down, will you, please?

55:04.114 --> 55:07.898
I'm so sorry. Something
has to be done about the music.

55:07.993 --> 55:10.151
She starts the pirouette early.

55:10.245 --> 55:14.242
- The tempo's wrong. It's too fast.
- It's the right tempo.

55:14.331 --> 55:17.000
Of course. Once more.

55:23.714 --> 55:27.710
- She'll be all right.
- I hope so.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.876
Still unconverted, Sergei?

55:29.969 --> 55:33.835
Well, of course
she's a charming girl, but...

55:33.930 --> 55:36.219
I know nothing about her charms.

55:36.307 --> 55:40.470
But they won't wait till the end,
they'll applaud in the middle!

55:41.478 --> 55:44.681
- Come now.
- Sergei, I'll take a bet.

55:44.773 --> 55:46.397
Oh, enough. Enough.

55:48.484 --> 55:53.229
Miss Page, we are trying to create
something of beauty.

55:53.322 --> 55:56.358
While you wave your arms
like a scarecrow

55:56.449 --> 55:59.154
and bend your knees
like an old cart horse,

55:59.243 --> 56:01.152
we are unlikely to succeed.

56:05.332 --> 56:07.953
Well, well...it's a bet.

56:09.043 --> 56:11.285
Come, let me see your sketches.

56:13.589 --> 56:15.416
The girl.

56:53.914 --> 56:56.239
You still think I can do it?

56:56.333 --> 57:00.330
Well, at the moment, you look as if
you find it difficult.

57:00.419 --> 57:04.417
But when we open in two weeks,
I hope it'll be supremely simple.

57:06.633 --> 57:09.633
Don't forget,
the great impression of simplicity

57:09.719 --> 57:13.337
can only be achieved by a great agony
of body and spirit.

57:13.430 --> 57:16.763
Voilà.

57:16.850 --> 57:20.053
You don't want to ruin
your breathing, do you?

57:21.604 --> 57:24.308
From today,
you'll lunch in my office.

57:24.398 --> 57:25.809
Craster.

57:32.864 --> 57:35.188
Will you sit over there, please?

57:35.282 --> 57:37.405
Merci. Mr Craster, the piano.

57:37.493 --> 57:40.943
Do you usually have musical
accompaniment to your meals?

57:41.037 --> 57:42.579
No, Miss Page, I do not.

57:42.664 --> 57:46.114
I'm afraid this is your fate
for the next two weeks.

57:46.208 --> 57:49.411
Mr Craster is going to play
The Red Shoes music

57:49.503 --> 57:53.203
at every lunch, tea and dinner
you take until we open.

57:53.298 --> 57:55.089
I see.

57:55.174 --> 58:00.048
Yes. In this way, you should become
quite familiar with the music.

58:00.136 --> 58:02.211
Yes, I think I probably shall.

58:02.304 --> 58:05.803
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.

58:05.891 --> 58:07.800
- Mr Craster.
- Certainly.

58:07.892 --> 58:09.766
Bon appétit.

58:13.397 --> 58:15.638
à votre service, mademoiselle.

58:18.860 --> 58:22.987
Some composers specialise in
lunchtime music, don't they?

58:23.072 --> 58:27.069
- Some.
- You?

58:27.159 --> 58:28.736
In my time.

58:35.749 --> 58:37.991
Do you mind not playing that?

58:39.711 --> 58:41.170
It's the right tempo.

58:42.588 --> 58:44.711
Let's take the ballroom scene.

58:44.799 --> 58:48.132
That's the most digestible
part of the score.

58:48.218 --> 58:50.092
The ballroom's been cut.

58:50.178 --> 58:55.764
Cut as a scene, but it's still there
in my score.

58:55.850 --> 58:58.008
I wrote this dance for a ballroom.

58:58.102 --> 59:02.846
Anyone who understands anything
about music will see a ballroom.

59:10.988 --> 59:13.941
Even Lermontov will see a ballroom.

59:14.032 --> 59:15.442
Even you.

59:16.576 --> 59:20.157
And when you're lifted
into the air by your partner,

59:20.244 --> 59:22.201
my music will transform you.

59:22.288 --> 59:23.746
Into what?

59:25.999 --> 59:28.916
A flower...swaying in the wind.

59:30.795 --> 59:33.286
A cloud...drifting in the sky.

59:34.423 --> 59:36.914
A white bird...flying.

59:37.009 --> 59:38.586
Tell that to Ratov.

59:39.719 --> 59:42.424
He would love
your birds and flowers.

59:42.513 --> 59:43.711
You don't?

59:43.806 --> 59:47.424
- If you were a dancer, you'd know...
- Just a minute.

59:47.518 --> 59:50.186
# Nothing matters but the music #

59:50.270 --> 59:53.105
It's hard enough
to get off the ground anyway

59:53.189 --> 59:55.146
without being a bird or flower.

59:59.653 --> 01:00:02.606
Won't you imagine anything
on the first night?

01:00:05.866 --> 01:00:08.784
Yes, a wall between me
and the audience.

01:00:21.046 --> 01:00:23.453
My music will pull you through it.

01:00:56.367 --> 01:00:58.655
Hee-haw!

01:00:58.744 --> 01:01:02.112
Miss Page, I'm not a circus conductor
and you're not a horse.

01:01:02.205 --> 01:01:03.319
It's too fast.

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:07.663
You would not find it too fast

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:11.748
if you'd let the slow passage end
before you start your pirouette.

01:01:11.838 --> 01:01:14.459
My downbeat marks a pause.

01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:16.956
We understand it,
don't we, gentlemen?

01:01:17.051 --> 01:01:20.751
- You come in on the second beat.
- Impossible!

01:01:20.846 --> 01:01:22.968
One, two, tia, tia!

01:01:23.056 --> 01:01:25.843
It's quite simple.
You see this baton?

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:28.506
- Yes.
- Well, follow it!

01:02:09.803 --> 01:02:11.427
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

01:02:13.681 --> 01:02:15.638
Vicky. Vicky!

01:02:15.725 --> 01:02:18.298
Dance whatever tempo you like.
I'll follow you.

01:02:22.564 --> 01:02:24.390
All right, Ivan?

01:02:24.482 --> 01:02:26.060
Time to go down, Craster.

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:27.893
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:02:27.985 --> 01:02:30.440
- Nervous?
- No.

01:02:40.204 --> 01:02:42.280
Do I...?

01:02:42.372 --> 01:02:44.365
What the devil have you
got to worry about?

01:02:44.457 --> 01:02:48.786
It's a fine score.
A magnificent score. I only wish I...

01:02:48.878 --> 01:02:50.870
Go on.

01:03:30.287 --> 01:03:33.952
- Grischa.
- It's chaos, chaos, chaos!

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.875
- Grischa...
- Ah, Boris.

01:03:38.294 --> 01:03:40.666
- Mon dieu! The red shoes.
- What?

01:03:40.754 --> 01:03:43.755
The red shoes are not there!

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.749
- Rideaut.
- Monsieur.

01:03:47.635 --> 01:03:48.833
Where are they?

01:03:48.928 --> 01:03:52.343
- You haven't hidden them yourself?
- No, no, no!

01:03:52.431 --> 01:03:54.756
Yes! Fou! Fou!

01:04:04.358 --> 01:04:06.516
Boris, look here.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.269
Elephants.

01:04:08.361 --> 01:04:11.278
Clumsy elephants
have ruined my decor.

01:04:11.364 --> 01:04:14.779
- Calm yourself.
- The door! The door! It won't shut.

01:04:14.867 --> 01:04:17.238
- Somebody must hold it.
- But who?

01:04:17.327 --> 01:04:20.280
The call boy.
He'll have nothing to do.

01:04:20.371 --> 01:04:24.618
- Dimitri.
- Give it to me. Hold the door.

01:04:24.708 --> 01:04:28.656
- Best of luck, Miss Page.
- I can't remember my entrance.

01:04:28.752 --> 01:04:32.500
You think you can't.
What about this?

01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:36.204
That's it. It's all right
when I hear the music.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.087
Since you undoubtedly
will hear the music,

01:04:39.178 --> 01:04:41.799
it's undoubtedly
going to be all right.

01:04:41.888 --> 01:04:45.506
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.600
If I had any doubts
about you, I'd be nervous.

01:04:48.686 --> 01:04:50.512
- Am I nervous?
- No.

01:04:50.604 --> 01:04:52.893
You're not dancing for an audience.

01:04:52.981 --> 01:04:55.686
You're dancing for
Ljubov, Ratov, myself,

01:04:55.775 --> 01:04:58.527
people you've danced for
many times before.

01:04:58.611 --> 01:05:01.528
I believed in you
from the very beginning.

01:05:01.614 --> 01:05:04.104
But now everybody does.

01:05:04.199 --> 01:05:10.402
Dance tonight with the same ecstasy
I've seen in you only once before.

01:05:10.496 --> 01:05:11.990
At the Mercury Theatre?

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:15.994
Yes, at the Mercury Theatre
in London...

01:05:16.084 --> 01:05:17.958
on a wet Saturday afternoon.

01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:19.918
- 40 seconds.
- Coming.

01:05:22.923 --> 01:05:24.252
Good luck, my dear.

01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:28.919
You're the magician, to have produced
this in three weeks from nothing.

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:31.633
A magician can't produce
a rabbit from a hat

01:05:31.722 --> 01:05:34.295
if there isn't already
a rabbit in the hat.

01:05:55.283 --> 01:05:58.616
It's a pity the theatre
only holds 300.

01:05:58.703 --> 01:06:01.952
We could have filled
the Albert Hall tonight!

01:06:02.039 --> 01:06:06.036
But what we're creating tonight,
the world will talk of tomorrow.

01:06:09.629 --> 01:06:11.039
Good boy.

01:06:12.256 --> 01:06:13.584
Rideau.

01:23:39.006 --> 01:23:41.840
Ça va? Any swelling?

01:23:41.925 --> 01:23:43.632
I mean the head.

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:46.469
All that clapping, bravos, roses...

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:48.261
Puh! All that's nothing.

01:23:48.347 --> 01:23:52.640
But when I,
who have seen Pavlova dance,

01:23:52.725 --> 01:23:55.596
tell you that last night
you were not bad...

01:23:55.686 --> 01:23:57.809
not good, but not bad...

01:23:57.896 --> 01:23:59.972
that's something.

01:24:03.234 --> 01:24:04.894
Now I tell you truth.

01:24:04.986 --> 01:24:07.062
It was...

01:24:07.154 --> 01:24:09.443
- good.
- Thank you, Mr Ljubov.

01:24:09.531 --> 01:24:12.781
- My name is Grischa.
- Mine is Vicky.

01:24:12.868 --> 01:24:15.536
How do you do?

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:18.620
Arm straighter. So...

01:24:18.706 --> 01:24:20.912
Boris Lermontov wants to see you.

01:24:20.999 --> 01:24:23.324
Why in the class time? Why?

01:24:54.073 --> 01:24:56.066
Silence!

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:59.158
- Fifth.
- Bras.

01:25:02.329 --> 01:25:05.081
Hello? Hello? Yes.
Who is it? Oh, it's you!

01:25:05.165 --> 01:25:07.122
Monsieur Lermontov...

01:25:07.209 --> 01:25:10.162
No, no. It's fine.
Thank you for ringing me.

01:25:10.253 --> 01:25:12.578
You're not disturbing me at all.

01:25:12.671 --> 01:25:15.542
I always have time
for congratulations.

01:25:19.344 --> 01:25:22.463
- Oh, yes. I agree.
- Monsieur Lermontov...

01:25:22.555 --> 01:25:26.219
A most distinguished score.

01:25:26.308 --> 01:25:30.175
- Voilà, Monsieur Craster.
- Uh, Monsieur Craster?

01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:33.270
Yes.
Of course he'll contact me.

01:25:33.356 --> 01:25:34.766
Yes, he's going to.

01:25:34.857 --> 01:25:38.475
He's starting with a new ballet,
full of gait and charm.

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:41.141
La Belle Meunière,
book by Marcel Lucien.

01:25:41.237 --> 01:25:42.518
Go away.

01:25:42.614 --> 01:25:45.697
Yes. Oh, yes,
it's a wonderful role for her.

01:25:45.783 --> 01:25:48.700
- Au revoir, Lermontov.
- Au revoir, madame.

01:25:48.785 --> 01:25:50.694
No, not this season. Next season.

01:25:53.873 --> 01:25:55.201
Merci beaucoup.

01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:57.864
Yes. It was very kind
of you to ring me.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.335
Thank you very much.

01:25:59.419 --> 01:26:02.290
No more calls,
not even congratulations.

01:26:04.716 --> 01:26:07.087
Au revoir. Where are those papers?

01:26:07.176 --> 01:26:08.967
Thank you very much. Here.

01:26:11.054 --> 01:26:12.596
Excusez-moi.

01:26:12.681 --> 01:26:15.764
Well, Mr Craster, that's all.
I'm proud of you.

01:26:15.849 --> 01:26:19.977
- Mr Lermontov, I would like to...
- Some other time...ah, yes!

01:26:20.061 --> 01:26:21.804
- Do you read French?
- Yes.

01:26:21.896 --> 01:26:25.478
Well, read it.
We'll talk about it some other time.

01:26:27.901 --> 01:26:29.858
Mademoiselle Page.

01:26:29.944 --> 01:26:33.894
Come in, Miss Page, come in.
Sit down.

01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:37.156
I want to talk to you
about your future.

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:40.989
When we first met,

01:26:41.079 --> 01:26:45.290
you asked me a question to which
I gave a stupid answer.

01:26:45.374 --> 01:26:48.825
You asked me whether
I wanted to live and I said yes.

01:26:48.919 --> 01:26:51.706
Actually, I want more, much more!

01:26:51.796 --> 01:26:52.994
I want to create,

01:26:53.089 --> 01:26:56.671
to make something big
out of something little...

01:26:56.759 --> 01:26:59.878
to make a great dancer out of you.

01:26:59.970 --> 01:27:03.173
But first, I must ask you
the same question.

01:27:03.264 --> 01:27:05.173
What do you want from life?

01:27:06.309 --> 01:27:07.886
- To live?
- To dance.

01:27:15.608 --> 01:27:19.059
We have two months left of the season
in Monte Carlo.

01:27:19.153 --> 01:27:21.857
Not much time,
but enough, two months.

01:27:21.947 --> 01:27:26.692
Then we go on tour - Rome, Vienna,
Copenhagen, Stuttgart, then America.

01:27:26.784 --> 01:27:28.907
Then next year, London again.

01:27:28.995 --> 01:27:31.069
All the big parts for you...

01:27:31.162 --> 01:27:35.373
Coppelia, Lac des Cygnes, Gisèle,
Les Sylphides, La Boutique...

01:27:35.457 --> 01:27:37.248
We create them all first with you.

01:27:37.334 --> 01:27:39.291
You shall dance...

01:27:39.377 --> 01:27:41.085
and the world shall follow.

01:27:41.171 --> 01:27:43.246
You... Shh!

01:27:43.339 --> 01:27:45.497
Not a word.

01:27:45.591 --> 01:27:48.129
I will do the talking.

01:27:48.218 --> 01:27:50.543
You...

01:27:50.637 --> 01:27:52.345
will do the dancing.

01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:54.339
( # La Boutique Fantasque )

01:28:18.035 --> 01:28:19.659
Ah, Victoria Page.

01:28:22.998 --> 01:28:25.488
- Good night, Boris.
- Night, Grischa.

01:28:25.583 --> 01:28:28.288
- She was not bad tonight.
- She'll be all right.

01:28:28.377 --> 01:28:32.955
All right! Not bad!
But she's a flame!

01:28:34.799 --> 01:28:38.843
- Still la-di-da? Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

01:28:38.928 --> 01:28:45.808
Vicky was wonderful in Boutique,
just a little Dresden shepherdess.

01:28:45.892 --> 01:28:48.346
We should reconstruct the theatre.

01:28:48.435 --> 01:28:51.056
- What's wrong with it?
- It's too small!

01:28:51.146 --> 01:28:53.932
- Good night, Lermontov.
- Good night, Livy.

01:28:54.023 --> 01:28:57.356
- Her timing's a miracle.
- Keep her up to it.

01:28:57.443 --> 01:28:59.601
( # Coppelia )

01:29:56.368 --> 01:29:59.404
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Grischa.

01:30:00.788 --> 01:30:04.073
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

01:30:05.124 --> 01:30:08.409
- Good night, Mr Lermontov.
- Good night, Vicky.

01:31:04.174 --> 01:31:08.088
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

01:31:08.178 --> 01:31:11.095
Uh, thank you,
Monsieur Boudin. That's all.

01:31:12.223 --> 01:31:14.796
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Grischa.

01:31:14.892 --> 01:31:17.014
- Boudin.
- Oui?

01:31:17.102 --> 01:31:20.102
Which is the very best restaurant
on the coast?

01:31:20.188 --> 01:31:22.309
- La Resserre.
- Oui, La Resserre.

01:31:22.397 --> 01:31:25.516
- Good night, Lermontov.
- Good night, Livy.

01:31:26.609 --> 01:31:28.518
Book me a table.

01:31:30.863 --> 01:31:34.361
- For...two?
- Yes.

01:31:36.576 --> 01:31:38.235
Au revoir.

01:31:38.327 --> 01:31:40.035
- Julian.
- Yes?

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.528
I never said good night to Lermontov.

01:31:42.623 --> 01:31:46.536
Monsieur Dimitri?
No, Miss Page has still not come in.

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:50.125
Monsieur Ratov? Uh, not yet, either.

01:31:50.212 --> 01:31:53.545
Monsieur Ljubov? 317... No.

01:31:55.925 --> 01:31:58.594
Ah, Monsieur Dimitri, I've just heard

01:31:58.678 --> 01:32:03.138
they've all gone to supper
at the Old Port with Monsieur Ljubov.

01:32:03.223 --> 01:32:04.682
His birthday!

01:32:56.684 --> 01:33:00.219
Class! Class! Un gateau.

01:33:09.821 --> 01:33:11.564
Ah, merci.

01:33:18.953 --> 01:33:20.578
Boris Lermontov!

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:26.993
Greetings, Grischa.

01:33:27.085 --> 01:33:29.042
Am I permitted
to join your party?

01:33:29.129 --> 01:33:32.462
Get me a chair!
What a pleasure, Boris.

01:33:32.548 --> 01:33:34.505
A chair for Boris Lermontov!

01:33:34.592 --> 01:33:38.920
Two chairs for Boris Lermontov!
Make way there. A throne.

01:33:39.012 --> 01:33:41.467
A throne for the great Boris.
Take mine.

01:33:41.556 --> 01:33:42.884
No, no, take mine.

01:33:42.974 --> 01:33:45.595
No, you sit down.
It's your birthday.

01:33:46.727 --> 01:33:47.925
Well...

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:52.348
seems a long time since I sat down
to supper with my entire family.

01:34:05.867 --> 01:34:11.027
But it appears that the great
Miss Page is not with us tonight.

01:34:11.122 --> 01:34:15.166
Don't you miss another member
of our happy little family?

01:34:17.377 --> 01:34:20.128
No...no. I can't say I do.

01:34:20.213 --> 01:34:24.589
Why should you? You're a busy man.
Have a drink, Lermontov!

01:34:26.718 --> 01:34:29.256
Grischa. Ta santé.

01:34:29.345 --> 01:34:33.045
Of course we all know
you're a busy man, Boris Lermontov,

01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:36.224
but do you mean to tell me
you have noticed nothing?

01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:38.979
Don't exaggerate.

01:34:39.062 --> 01:34:42.596
Boris, we have a little romance
in our midst.

01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:44.232
A great romance!

01:34:44.316 --> 01:34:48.693
- Romeo Craster.
- And Juliet...Page.

01:34:50.947 --> 01:34:54.481
And when...
did this great romance begin?

01:34:54.575 --> 01:34:57.148
With the Red Shoes.

01:34:59.663 --> 01:35:01.572
Charming.

01:35:01.664 --> 01:35:04.700
And where have they
taken themselves tonight?

01:35:04.792 --> 01:35:08.492
What does it matter
where they've gone?

01:35:08.587 --> 01:35:12.999
They are young, they are together
and they are in love.

01:35:44.325 --> 01:35:47.278
Darling.

01:35:47.369 --> 01:35:50.572
I've decided I do believe in destiny
after all.

01:35:50.663 --> 01:35:54.281
Do you, my darling? I'm very glad.

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:04.750
Cocher.

01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:08.671
Cocher!

01:36:14.475 --> 01:36:15.756
You'll wake him.

01:36:15.851 --> 01:36:19.018
But I want to know where we are.

01:36:20.355 --> 01:36:22.182
Cocher? Co...

01:36:35.951 --> 01:36:38.987
One day, when I'm old,

01:36:39.079 --> 01:36:42.245
I want some lovely young girl
to say to me...

01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:49.875
"Tell me, where in your long life,
Mr Craster, were you most happy?"

01:36:51.214 --> 01:36:52.756
And I shall say...

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.466
"Well, my dear, I never knew
the exact place.

01:36:57.553 --> 01:37:01.253
"It was somewhere
on the Mediterranean.

01:37:01.347 --> 01:37:03.755
"I was with Victoria Page."

01:37:04.892 --> 01:37:10.099
"What?" she will say.
"Do you mean the famous dancer?"

01:37:10.188 --> 01:37:15.644
And I will nod, "Yes, my dear, I do.

01:37:15.735 --> 01:37:22.697
"But then, she was quite young,
comparatively unspoiled.

01:37:22.782 --> 01:37:28.321
"We were, I remember,
very much in love."

01:37:35.793 --> 01:37:37.833
( # Swan Lake )

01:38:10.822 --> 01:38:12.779
Did you see that?

01:38:12.865 --> 01:38:15.024
She smiled at Craster.

01:38:15.117 --> 01:38:16.362
I don't think so.

01:38:16.452 --> 01:38:19.986
I suppose you will be sending me
to an oculist next.

01:38:24.083 --> 01:38:25.708
Watch her dancing.

01:38:26.877 --> 01:38:28.751
With pleasure.

01:38:30.297 --> 01:38:34.080
Debutantes...at a charity matinée.

01:38:42.432 --> 01:38:45.516
Yes. Yes!

01:38:46.894 --> 01:38:49.219
Yes. All right. Thursday.

01:38:49.313 --> 01:38:51.222
Good evening, Mr Lermontov.

01:38:51.315 --> 01:38:54.351
I'm afraid the score's
still a bit rough,

01:38:54.442 --> 01:38:56.814
but I see you had
time to look at it.

01:38:56.903 --> 01:38:58.942
Yes, Mr Craster.

01:39:00.322 --> 01:39:01.982
I have looked at it.

01:39:04.533 --> 01:39:09.195
However, it's not about your music
that I wish to talk at the moment.

01:39:09.287 --> 01:39:11.612
So to come to the point...

01:39:11.706 --> 01:39:14.991
What is all this I hear
about you and Miss Page?

01:39:15.084 --> 01:39:16.957
Oh, I see.

01:39:18.087 --> 01:39:20.660
- Could Dimitri...?
- Get out.

01:39:20.755 --> 01:39:23.590
Well, Mr Craster?

01:39:28.387 --> 01:39:29.964
Yes. We're in love.

01:39:32.515 --> 01:39:34.508
I see.

01:39:35.935 --> 01:39:39.220
Did you see Miss Page's performance
in Lac des Cygnes?

01:39:39.313 --> 01:39:41.056
I was conducting.

01:39:41.148 --> 01:39:42.393
Did you enjoy it?

01:39:42.482 --> 01:39:45.234
It was the loveliest thing
I've ever seen.

01:39:45.318 --> 01:39:47.476
It was impossible.

01:39:48.612 --> 01:39:51.364
And you know why it was impossible?

01:39:51.448 --> 01:39:55.113
Because neither her mind nor her
heart were in her work.

01:39:55.201 --> 01:39:57.822
She was...dreaming.

01:39:57.912 --> 01:40:02.241
And dreaming is a luxury
I've never permitted in my company.

01:40:02.332 --> 01:40:04.704
Miss Page wants to be a great dancer.

01:40:04.793 --> 01:40:07.959
Perhaps she has spoken to you
about her ambitions.

01:40:08.046 --> 01:40:09.243
Oh, yes.

01:40:09.338 --> 01:40:12.707
She's not, however,
a great dancer yet.

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.709
Nor is she likely to become one

01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:20.043
if she allows herself to be
sidetracked by idiotic flirtations.

01:40:20.139 --> 01:40:23.304
Mr Lermontov, you...don't understand.

01:40:24.433 --> 01:40:26.473
We really are in love.

01:40:32.732 --> 01:40:37.643
And, Mr Craster, I have had time
to look at your latest effort...

01:40:37.736 --> 01:40:38.851
Yes?

01:40:38.946 --> 01:40:41.271
..and find it equally impossible.

01:40:52.624 --> 01:40:55.827
That's not true. It's good.

01:40:55.919 --> 01:40:57.958
Childish...

01:40:58.045 --> 01:41:00.797
vulgar...
and completely insignificant.

01:41:01.965 --> 01:41:05.001
In that case,
I'll relieve you of it.

01:41:05.093 --> 01:41:08.426
There are so many
first-class ballet companies

01:41:08.513 --> 01:41:11.299
to which you may
take it with advantage.

01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:13.513
Ballet work is not my great ambition.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.060
Some of us think it's rather
a second-rate means of expression.

01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:26.978
- 'Oui, Monsieur Lermontov?'
- Mr Craster is leaving the company.

01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:30.485
Pay him two weeks' salary
and get the receipt.

01:41:59.972 --> 01:42:01.680
Oh, hello, Boris.

01:42:01.765 --> 01:42:04.516
- I was coming to say good night.
- Good night.

01:42:04.601 --> 01:42:06.677
- Is anything the matter?
- No, no.

01:42:06.769 --> 01:42:10.897
And before I forget, don't do any
more work on the new ballet.

01:42:10.981 --> 01:42:14.516
- I decided to scrap it.
- Scrap it? What do you mean?

01:42:14.609 --> 01:42:17.526
I worked out
half the choreography already.

01:42:17.612 --> 01:42:20.103
That boy Julian is really gifted.

01:42:20.197 --> 01:42:22.522
It's one of our finest scores.

01:42:22.616 --> 01:42:27.573
Julian Craster is leaving and
I don't wish to discuss it further.

01:42:27.662 --> 01:42:30.331
Oh, you don't? Well, I do!

01:42:30.414 --> 01:42:34.542
Do you think I don't know
a brilliant score when I hear one?

01:42:34.626 --> 01:42:37.543
Do you think I've been
working day and night

01:42:37.671 --> 01:42:41.798
for the pleasure of being told
I am wasting my time?

01:42:41.883 --> 01:42:48.762
I tell you, Boris, I've had enough
of this lunatic asylum!

01:42:48.847 --> 01:42:51.219
I am through with it!

01:42:51.307 --> 01:42:53.216
I resign!

01:42:54.435 --> 01:42:57.683
I think you've made
a very important decision.

01:43:11.573 --> 01:43:15.571
Hello, you two. Isn't love wonderful?.

01:43:19.288 --> 01:43:21.660
Bonsoir, Julian.

01:43:21.749 --> 01:43:23.373
Hello.

01:43:28.463 --> 01:43:30.289
Well, what did he say?

01:43:30.381 --> 01:43:35.007
Ah. Of course he doesn't really
want you to go, Grischa.

01:43:35.093 --> 01:43:36.422
He is very sorry.

01:43:36.511 --> 01:43:39.962
Well, in that case,
I will think about it.

01:43:40.056 --> 01:43:41.466
What about Julian?

01:43:41.557 --> 01:43:47.345
I have never seen him
quite as bad as this.

01:43:47.437 --> 01:43:53.688
He talked a great deal about
ingratitude and...disloyalty.

01:43:53.776 --> 01:43:57.643
And he said when personal relations
start to interfere...

01:43:57.738 --> 01:43:59.529
Yes, I know that bit.

01:44:00.698 --> 01:44:04.742
My dear children, I'm very sorry.

01:44:06.787 --> 01:44:09.823
Boris might feel different
in the morning.

01:44:09.915 --> 01:44:14.824
The morning? He's leaving for Paris
by the 8.15 train.

01:44:44.735 --> 01:44:47.522
Has the famous Miss Page
come to see me off?

01:44:48.988 --> 01:44:50.897
I'd like to talk to you.

01:45:00.915 --> 01:45:04.331
I want to know
why you quarrelled with Julian.

01:45:04.418 --> 01:45:08.498
May I suggest that such matters
are hardly your business?

01:45:10.590 --> 01:45:13.875
However, since you've gone to
all this trouble...

01:45:16.178 --> 01:45:20.721
Mr Craster has been unwise enough
to interfere with plans of mine.

01:45:20.807 --> 01:45:23.594
And that is something
I do not permit.

01:45:25.728 --> 01:45:29.261
I thought once that
there would be no room in my life

01:45:29.355 --> 01:45:32.059
for anything but dancing.

01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:34.225
You'll think so again, my dear.

01:45:34.318 --> 01:45:36.773
But if Julian goes, I shall go, too.

01:45:39.822 --> 01:45:41.898
And what do you intend to do?

01:45:41.991 --> 01:45:43.734
I shall dance somewhere else.

01:45:43.826 --> 01:45:45.948
Oh, yes.

01:45:46.036 --> 01:45:49.903
That won't be very difficult
with the name I've given you.

01:45:49.998 --> 01:45:53.580
Always provided I release you
of your contract.

01:45:54.752 --> 01:45:59.709
But even if I do,
would it be quite the same?

01:46:01.174 --> 01:46:03.545
I have never pretended it would.

01:46:06.845 --> 01:46:12.633
I could make you one of the greatest
dancers the world has ever known.

01:46:15.478 --> 01:46:19.973
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I do.

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:24.481
And all that means nothing to you?

01:46:26.695 --> 01:46:29.447
You know exactly
what it means to me.

01:46:34.911 --> 01:46:37.282
The train is leaving!

01:46:38.789 --> 01:46:40.366
Goodbye, Mr Lermontov.

01:46:47.003 --> 01:46:49.494
Miss Page is coming!

01:46:57.095 --> 01:47:00.962
Julian! Julian!

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:05.058
I'm coming with you!

01:47:05.144 --> 01:47:07.599
Hooray!

01:48:03.859 --> 01:48:05.483
The fool.

01:48:08.196 --> 01:48:09.820
The fool.

01:48:12.658 --> 01:48:14.366
No!

01:48:53.902 --> 01:48:56.475
Come in. You are late.

01:48:56.571 --> 01:48:58.693
I hope you didn't work too hard.

01:48:58.781 --> 01:49:02.149
All finished.
I have the injunction with me.

01:49:32.892 --> 01:49:36.592
Boris, don't tell me you've
changed your mind again.

01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:46.520
I...I don't want to stop her
doing anything.

01:49:47.655 --> 01:49:52.992
She can dance when and where
she likes...except the Red Shoes.

01:49:53.076 --> 01:49:55.863
- What about the boy?
- That's different.

01:49:55.953 --> 01:49:59.120
Everything written under contract
to me is mine.

01:49:59.206 --> 01:50:02.906
The Red Shoes and his work so far
on La Belle Meunière.

01:50:03.001 --> 01:50:05.788
I'm not interested in
anything else he writes.

01:50:05.878 --> 01:50:09.543
If you do The Red Shoes,
you'll have to pay him royalties.

01:50:09.632 --> 01:50:12.549
Red Shoes is no longer
in the repertoire!

01:50:12.634 --> 01:50:14.009
Oh.

01:50:22.101 --> 01:50:25.136
I understand Patrick Trevellyan
is in Paris.

01:50:26.312 --> 01:50:27.688
Yes.

01:50:27.772 --> 01:50:29.895
I dined with them both last night.

01:50:29.982 --> 01:50:32.271
Oh?

01:50:32.359 --> 01:50:35.609
- Boronskaja was with him?
- Yes.

01:50:36.946 --> 01:50:38.274
Anything I can do?

01:50:38.363 --> 01:50:40.688
How's their marriage? Success?

01:50:40.782 --> 01:50:43.273
Patrick seems to think so.

01:50:43.368 --> 01:50:46.902
Would you like me to arrange
a meeting with Irina?

01:50:48.330 --> 01:50:50.121
Not arrange.

01:50:51.541 --> 01:50:53.368
By chance.

01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:25.438
Oh! Boris!

01:51:30.366 --> 01:51:32.405
( # Les Sylphides )

01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:00.799
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Irina.

01:52:02.684 --> 01:52:06.384
- Good season.
- With the Ballet Lermontov, always.

01:52:07.938 --> 01:52:11.022
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

01:52:11.108 --> 01:52:12.353
- Sergei!
- Yes?

01:52:12.442 --> 01:52:16.356
- Would you wait a minute, please?
- Yes, of course, Boris.

01:52:20.616 --> 01:52:24.150
- Good night, Boris!
- Grischa, please come in and wait.

01:52:25.412 --> 01:52:28.994
Oh...a conference.

01:52:30.749 --> 01:52:33.157
- Ah!
- Uh!

01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.004
Letters.

01:52:40.132 --> 01:52:43.964
- Nobody writes to me.
- That's not true.

01:52:44.052 --> 01:52:46.460
Yours...from Vicky.

01:52:46.554 --> 01:52:49.092
From Vicky?

01:52:49.182 --> 01:52:51.803
- How is that girl?.
- Read it. You'll see.

01:52:52.935 --> 01:52:55.011
And this is from Julian.

01:52:55.103 --> 01:52:57.060
It's all about his new opera.

01:52:58.356 --> 01:53:04.974
It describes the whole structure.
Enormous talent, that boy.

01:53:08.573 --> 01:53:09.948
He says...

01:53:11.075 --> 01:53:13.363
"She is an inspiration.

01:53:15.453 --> 01:53:16.828
"A miracle."

01:53:16.913 --> 01:53:20.495
- Thank you, Mr Boudin. That's all.
- Merci. Bonsoir.

01:53:20.582 --> 01:53:23.749
Well...I see it's mail day.

01:53:23.835 --> 01:53:26.373
From our two young rebels.

01:53:26.462 --> 01:53:30.376
Deserters. I hope they're happy.

01:53:30.466 --> 01:53:33.550
- Read, Boris.
- Yes. Read this, too.

01:53:33.635 --> 01:53:37.169
It might make you sorry
to have lost that young man.

01:53:37.263 --> 01:53:39.302
I doubt it.

01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:40.849
That reminds me...

01:53:40.933 --> 01:53:44.764
Jacques sent me
the new score of La Belle Meunière.

01:53:44.853 --> 01:53:47.770
I like it.
I'd like you all to hear it at once.

01:53:47.856 --> 01:53:49.978
We might open with it in London.

01:53:50.066 --> 01:53:52.936
- With Irina?
- We can discuss that.

01:53:53.610 --> 01:53:56.148
Lights, all gaiety, fire.

01:53:56.238 --> 01:54:00.401
Be good enough to glance through it.
And no prejudice, please.

01:54:00.491 --> 01:54:03.196
I hope you say that
to yourself sometimes.

01:54:03.285 --> 01:54:04.993
Every day. Good night.

01:54:05.078 --> 01:54:06.987
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:10.698
On second thought, I think
I would like to read those letters.

01:54:18.048 --> 01:54:22.045
My letter was only meant
to be read by me.

01:54:22.135 --> 01:54:24.044
See you later, Boris.

01:54:24.136 --> 01:54:25.465
Good night, Sergei.

01:54:34.644 --> 01:54:37.764
I could hardly let him read it.

01:54:37.855 --> 01:54:40.393
She calls him a monster...

01:54:40.483 --> 01:54:43.269
a gifted, cruel monster.

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:45.399
You should have told him that.

01:59:13.753 --> 01:59:17.537
I...I am sorry to be late,
Boris Lermontov.

01:59:22.677 --> 01:59:25.215
Lady Neston was in front tonight.

01:59:26.347 --> 01:59:29.965
She arrived this morning.
She is staying for several weeks.

01:59:31.101 --> 01:59:34.885
And Miss Page is joining her
next week for a short holiday.

02:00:06.505 --> 02:00:10.289
We seem destined to meet
at railway stations.

02:00:10.384 --> 02:00:15.259
- What are you doing in Cannes?
- Waiting for you. Won't you sit?

02:00:22.769 --> 02:00:24.678
But you know, my dear Vicky,

02:00:24.771 --> 02:00:27.688
how I'm always looking
for great dancers.

02:00:34.487 --> 02:00:36.112
We all have missed you.

02:00:36.197 --> 02:00:40.360
And I was hoping that by now
you would have started to miss us...

02:00:40.451 --> 02:00:42.028
a little.

02:00:42.119 --> 02:00:43.945
I have.

02:00:45.121 --> 02:00:47.659
You only have to say the words.

02:00:49.625 --> 02:00:52.828
- How is everybody?
- Never better.

02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:56.418
- How is Grischa?
- Always fighting with Boronskaja.

02:00:56.505 --> 02:00:59.292
- And she?
- Always fighting with Grischa.

02:00:59.383 --> 02:01:01.126
- Sergei?
- Getting younger.

02:01:01.217 --> 02:01:03.922
- And you?
- Getting older.

02:01:04.011 --> 02:01:06.502
And you? You are happy?

02:01:06.597 --> 02:01:08.720
Yes. Very happy.

02:01:09.808 --> 02:01:11.931
As a dancer, I mean.

02:01:13.228 --> 02:01:15.434
I haven't danced much, you know.

02:01:15.521 --> 02:01:16.801
Oh, I know.

02:01:16.897 --> 02:01:19.566
I know every time you have danced.

02:01:19.650 --> 02:01:22.105
- But you never stopped working?
- No.

02:01:22.194 --> 02:01:25.894
- You never stopped going to class?
- Never.

02:01:27.365 --> 02:01:29.653
And why isn't he with you?

02:01:29.742 --> 02:01:32.446
His opera's been accepted
at Covent Garden.

02:01:32.536 --> 02:01:34.030
It's in rehearsal now.

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:37.370
- Would he give it up if you asked?
- I don't know.

02:01:37.457 --> 02:01:39.330
- You do.
- I wouldn't ask.

02:01:39.417 --> 02:01:44.541
Then why is he asking you?
Does he know what he is asking?

02:01:51.552 --> 02:01:56.711
We are preparing a new ballet.
We've been working for weeks.

02:01:56.806 --> 02:02:01.514
The costumes and the decor are the
most beautiful Ratov has ever done.

02:02:01.602 --> 02:02:05.729
Grischa's full of enthusiasm.
Do you know what that means?

02:02:10.650 --> 02:02:15.228
Nobody else has ever danced
The Red Shoes since you left.

02:02:16.697 --> 02:02:18.736
Nobody else ever shall.

02:02:21.493 --> 02:02:23.984
Put on the red shoes, Vicky...

02:02:24.078 --> 02:02:26.747
and dance for us again.

02:02:35.505 --> 02:02:37.663
'This is the BBC Third Program.

02:02:37.757 --> 02:02:41.339
'I am at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London.

02:02:41.427 --> 02:02:45.340
'Tonight is the first night
of Cupid and Psyche,

02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:48.881
'a new opera by British composer
Julian Craster,

02:02:48.975 --> 02:02:53.268
'whose only well-known work has been

'The Red Shoes was a great success

'when produced at Monte Carlo

'Oh. Something must have gone wrong.

02:03:07.657 --> 02:03:10.574
'I think somebody's going
to make an announcement.'

02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:12.533
'Ladies and gentlemen,

02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:16.486
'I regret to announce that
Mr Julian Craster the composer,

02:03:16.581 --> 02:03:20.792
'who was to conduct his own opera,

'Sir Hartley Menzies
will conduct in his place.'

02:03:25.506 --> 02:03:28.291
'Here comes Sir Hartley Menzies now.'

02:03:28.382 --> 02:03:31.715
'I'll announce the cast
at the interval.'

02:03:45.939 --> 02:03:50.399
All the way down from London,
I wondered if I'd find you here.

02:03:50.484 --> 02:03:52.192
And here you are.

02:03:52.277 --> 02:03:57.188
- So you left your first night?
- Yes.

02:03:57.282 --> 02:03:59.274
Oh, Julian.

02:04:00.409 --> 02:04:02.318
Why didn't you?

02:04:07.874 --> 02:04:11.325
This is all that matters.

02:04:12.461 --> 02:04:15.296
All right, love, my sweetheart.

02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:19.247
There's a train to Paris at 8.00.
We'll be on it together.

02:04:20.343 --> 02:04:22.252
Better hurry and get changed.

02:04:22.345 --> 02:04:24.633
- But I'm dancing tonight.
- Walk out.

02:04:26.306 --> 02:04:28.097
Good evening, Mr Craster.

02:04:28.183 --> 02:04:31.267
Won't they be missing you
at Covent Garden?

02:04:33.312 --> 02:04:35.103
Leave me alone, both of you!

02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:38.557
Please, Julian,
wait until after the performance.

02:04:38.650 --> 02:04:40.144
it'll be too late then.

02:04:40.235 --> 02:04:44.776
You're already too late, Mr Craster.
Tell him why you've left him.

02:04:44.863 --> 02:04:46.736
- I haven't left him!
- Oh, yes.

02:04:46.823 --> 02:04:49.609
Nobody can have two lives -
yours is dancing.

02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:53.448
Vicky, you can dance anywhere else
in the whole world.

02:04:53.537 --> 02:04:56.621
Would you be satisfied
with less than the best?

02:04:56.706 --> 02:04:58.829
If so, you'd never be a great artist.

02:04:58.916 --> 02:05:01.786
Would you make her
a great dancer as well?.

02:05:01.877 --> 02:05:03.075
Never!

02:05:03.170 --> 02:05:08.709
Why do you think I've waited so long
for a chance to win her back?

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.421
- Because you're jealous of her.
- Yes!

02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:15.128
I am...but in a way that
you will never understand.

02:05:17.849 --> 02:05:19.426
Wait!

02:05:24.813 --> 02:05:26.355
Well, Vicky?

02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:30.223
I love you, Julian! Nobody but you!

02:05:33.279 --> 02:05:34.821
But you love that more.

02:05:35.989 --> 02:05:38.860
I don't know! I don't know.

02:05:40.535 --> 02:05:44.366
If you go with him now,
I will never take you back. Never!

02:05:44.455 --> 02:05:47.823
Vicky, do you want to
destroy our love?

02:05:47.916 --> 02:05:49.992
Adolescent nonsense!

02:05:50.085 --> 02:05:53.998
All right. Go, then. Go with him.

02:05:54.088 --> 02:05:59.508
Be a faithful housewife
with a crowd of screaming children!

02:05:59.593 --> 02:06:01.917
Finish with dancing forever!

02:06:02.010 --> 02:06:04.133
Vicky...look at me.

02:06:23.487 --> 02:06:26.025
Goodbye, then, my darling.

02:06:29.701 --> 02:06:31.243
Julian.

02:06:35.122 --> 02:06:37.826
Peut-on commencer l'ouverture?

02:06:37.916 --> 02:06:41.000
- Oui. Commencez.
- Bon. Bon. Bon.

02:06:41.461 --> 02:06:44.663
Alors, commencez toute de suite.
Vite! Vite!

02:06:44.755 --> 02:06:46.214
Vicky...

02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:52.839
Vicky. Little Vicky.

02:06:55.014 --> 02:06:58.382
There it is, all waiting for you.

02:06:58.475 --> 02:07:02.306
The sorrow will pass, believe me.

02:07:02.395 --> 02:07:05.764
Life is so unimportant.

02:07:07.316 --> 02:07:11.693
And from now onwards,
you will dance...

02:07:12.821 --> 02:07:15.027
like nobody ever before.

02:07:52.061 --> 02:07:53.472
Mon petit.

02:07:56.565 --> 02:07:59.768
Mon petit! Ah! Monsieur Lermontov!

02:08:09.451 --> 02:08:11.823
Mademoiselle Page!

02:09:21.511 --> 02:09:26.089
Ladies...and gentlemen!

02:09:30.102 --> 02:09:34.680
I'm sorry...to tell you...

02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:41.526
that Miss Page...is unable...

02:09:43.071 --> 02:09:46.237
to dance...tonight...

02:09:48.993 --> 02:09:51.032
Nor indeed...

02:09:53.204 --> 02:09:54.449
any other nights.

02:09:58.750 --> 02:10:04.040
Nevertheless...we've decided...

02:10:07.508 --> 02:10:11.920
to present...The Red Shoes!

02:10:17.141 --> 02:10:19.180
It...is...

02:10:20.393 --> 02:10:22.018
the ballet...

02:10:25.022 --> 02:10:26.896
that made her name...

02:10:29.151 --> 02:10:33.065
whose name...she made.

02:10:34.239 --> 02:10:37.358
We...present it...

02:10:40.494 --> 02:10:47.077
because...we think...

02:10:50.210 --> 02:10:51.954
she would have...

02:10:53.755 --> 02:10:56.424
wished it.

02:11:32.746 --> 02:11:34.026
Pas d'espoir.

02:11:43.296 --> 02:11:45.585
Julian?

02:11:45.673 --> 02:11:47.712
Yes, my darling?

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:50.836
Take off the red shoes.

02:11:51.305 --> 02:11:57.621
