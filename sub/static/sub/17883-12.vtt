00:10.610 --> 00:12.111
Oh, would you
pass me a...

00:12.113 --> 00:14.980
Absolutely.
Oh, thank you, dear.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.116
Oh. And some...

00:17.118 --> 00:18.550
There you go.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.053
Now don't forget
to pick up the thing

00:21.055 --> 00:23.055
from the place
this afternoon.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.657
Oh, I tried,
but they didn't have it.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.226
Well,
get the other thing.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.294
But it's all the way
across town.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.729
Okay. Fine. I'll do it.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.198
Good boy.
For you.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.402
You guys know you're
totally married, right?

00:36.404 --> 00:37.536
Green Card married.
Not real.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.372
Seems real to me.
You see that domestic ballet?

00:40.374 --> 00:42.141
She oatmealing you,
you tea bagging her?

00:42.143 --> 00:45.811
You're so lucky.
I have to tea bag myself.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.780
Would you leave
the man alone?

00:47.782 --> 00:49.381
Cam is just being
a broski,

00:49.383 --> 00:51.884
taking Molly off the market
till I make my move.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.953
It's all part of the ODC.
The OD... What?

00:54.955 --> 00:56.688
Don't ask.
It's a whole thing.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.023
ODC...

00:58.025 --> 00:59.358
Dawson's Creek.

00:59.360 --> 01:04.196
Now before you is my 22-step plan
to end up with Molly.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.098
I'm Dawson,

01:06.299 --> 01:07.533
Molly is Joey,

01:07.535 --> 01:09.068
and you're Jen,
the town slut.

01:09.070 --> 01:12.738
Not to be this guy, but that's, like,
the whitest show ever.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.673
That is such
a Jen thing to say.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.974
You're a fan
of the  <i>Creek?</i>

01:15.976 --> 01:19.244
Finally, something
we agree on.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.415
<i>♪ Dum, Da-da-dum-dum</i>

01:25.585 --> 01:27.953
What the hell
is on the roof?

01:27.955 --> 01:28.921
Oz, why do you
have a trident?

01:28.923 --> 01:30.289
Why don't you?
Now answer the question...

01:30.291 --> 01:34.359
Why is there a huge
electronic billboard on my roof?

01:34.361 --> 01:36.929
Because this place needs
to make some mad ducats,

01:36.931 --> 01:40.632
so I made a sweet deal
to rent it out as ad space.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.403
Did you, by any chance,
ask what ads they would be running?

01:44.771 --> 01:45.304
Way to go, Vee.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.672
You just allowed
our rival company

01:46.674 --> 01:48.874
to use our building to say
that we totally suck.

01:48.876 --> 01:52.845
Come on. Don't exaggerate.
It doesn't say that.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.914
- Oh.
- Ooh.

01:55.916 --> 01:56.949
Shaw's a dead man.

01:56.951 --> 02:02.221
You know, maybe I shouldn't have
signed that 20-year lease.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.860
Well, well, well.

02:07.862 --> 02:10.362
I always knew you were
beneath me, Oz.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.830
And now the world does, too.

02:11.832 --> 02:12.564
Carol, grab my trident.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.767
Ah, hang on. No need for fancy
aquatic weaponry.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.870
Just swung by
to admire my billboard

02:17.872 --> 02:22.841
and savor the moment
of me riding your ass.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.977
That sounded really gay,
baby.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.645
Yeah, I know.
Just drive!

02:28.048 --> 02:30.983
Make no mistakes about it, ladies.
We're at war.

02:30.985 --> 02:31.750
And Shaw drew first blood.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.785
Retaliation will be swift and merciless.
What do you got?

02:33.787 --> 02:36.155
The servers for these billboards
are Swiss cheese.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.490
I can make it say
anything we want.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.459
Any suggestions?

02:42.429 --> 02:45.097
That's amazing.
I love it!

02:45.099 --> 02:46.198
Truth in advertising.

02:47.168 --> 02:51.069
Guys, huge problem.
You gotta come see this.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.705
<i>So predictable, Oz.</i>

02:53.707 --> 02:55.207
<i>I knew you'd have</i>

02:55.209 --> 02:57.643
<i>try to mess with my billboard,</i>
<i>which is why</i>

02:57.645 --> 03:01.380
<i>I installed a Trojan horse</i>
<i>on the HDMI connection.</i>

03:01.382 --> 03:02.581
Cam, shut it down.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.682
I'm locked out

03:04.552 --> 03:08.253

Cam.
Almost there.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.889
<i>You lose, Oz.</i>

03:10.891 --> 03:13.058
<i>You've been jerking me</i>

03:13.060 --> 03:15.160

03:25.773 --> 03:29.208
All right. I shut it down
before our files got wiped.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.911
But not before it robo-spammed
your address book

03:32.913 --> 03:34.846
and said
we're out of business.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.715
Robo-spam? Worms?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.484
What the frick is going on?
Are we in the future?

03:39.486 --> 03:43.555
Cam, reconfigure the firewall,
then re-reconfigure it.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.623
Cash, damage control.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.692
Contact every client
that got that e-mail.

03:46.694 --> 03:51.563
Molly, explain everything
that's going on to Veronica.

03:52.031 --> 03:56.468
I'm gonna take down
that slimy little rodent once and for all.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.325
Crazy day today,
wasn't it?

04:20.327 --> 04:21.827
Even for Contra.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.829
Well, it's not over yet.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.464
I still gotta lock down
that firewall for Oz.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.367
Oh, well, don't stay up
too late, dear.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.035
Mwah. Night.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.970
What the hell was that?
What was what?

04:31.972 --> 04:33.005
Don't ignore it.
We kissed.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.240
We both did it like it was
totally natural.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.775
Oh, my God.
We're married.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.610
No. No. No. No.
We're not married.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.179
Did you just wash
my underpants?

04:41.414 --> 04:43.615
Married.
Married.

04:46.819 --> 04:49.888
Good morning, Veronica.
Here's today's schedule,

04:49.890 --> 04:51.290
these papers
need signing,

04:51.292 --> 04:55.193
I kissed Cameron, and your car is being
dropped off to get washed.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.629
Wait. What? When?

04:57.631 --> 04:58.997
How? And why?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.265
Come here!
Tell me everything.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.834
Was it, like, full open mouth,
'80s-style?

05:02.836 --> 05:03.969
It was more
like a peck.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.405
Can't you keep your tiny peck
in your pants?

05:06.407 --> 05:08.140
We're at war with Shaw.
No distractions.

05:08.142 --> 05:12.210
How did you kiss him? French? Eskimo?
Butterfly? Spider-man? Vampire?

05:12.212 --> 05:14.379
Just the regular kind.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.380
It was nice.

05:15.382 --> 05:20.118
I mean, I've been so hung up
on Melanie for so long,

05:20.120 --> 05:21.853
but now she's gone,

05:21.855 --> 05:23.822
and maybe it's time
I just moved on.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.857
Yes! From this subject.

05:25.859 --> 05:26.825
Mmm. Yeah.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.093
All aboard the train
to Bonetown.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.129
No. I'm not sure I'm ready to
purchase a ticket

05:31.131 --> 05:33.398
for that particular
train yet,

05:33.400 --> 05:35.634
but I have thought about
looking at the schedule.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.570
Look, whatever you do
with your pseudo-wife,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.038
Cash cannot find out
about it.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.408
I need our Prankmaster General
on his "A" game.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.777
Let me pour a little sauce
on this for you.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.080
I call it
Cheese Doodle.

05:48.082 --> 05:48.714
That's our target.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.982
Shaw's office has
a pressure-sensitive floor

05:50.984 --> 05:54.219
and audio detection sensors
in the walls.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.520
One sound,
and you're found.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.556
It seems a lot like
<i>Impossible.</i>

05:57.558 --> 06:00.759
What? No, it's totally
different.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.194
I'll drop down
from the ceiling

06:02.196 --> 06:03.895
and suspend over the desk
about an inch.

06:03.897 --> 06:04.663
It's gonna be awesome.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.665
Totally awesome. Also totally
<i>Impossible.</i>

06:06.667 --> 06:08.333
What's next? You're gonna
rip off your face

06:08.335 --> 06:10.502
and reveal you're Ving Rhames?
Well, actually, I...

06:10.504 --> 06:12.537
Ah, no. We're not doing
the face thing, Cash.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.173
But masks are fun.
Shutty.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.676
This model's gonna self-destruct
in five seconds.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.577
No.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.879
That took me
hours to build!

06:20.881 --> 06:23.849
Good! Channel that anger
towards Shaw.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.450
<i>We're gonna</i>
<i>hit him hard tonight.</i>

06:25.452 --> 06:27.085

<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>no talking.</i>

07:52.139 --> 07:54.172
New clients are here, baby.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.974
Mmm. More Contra converts.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.908
Please come in.
Have a seat.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.910
How's my face? Am I
rocking a dust-stache?

07:58.912 --> 08:00.445
You're good, baby.
Okay.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.914
Okay, people,
I'm gonna make this short.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.918
Why should you leave Contra?
Because they got hacked.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.453
They can't even protect
their own information.

08:08.455 --> 08:11.623
How can they possibly
protect yours?

08:11.625 --> 08:15.794
Fact, Double Dragon
is impenetrable,

08:15.796 --> 08:16.228
the best.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.864
And you have my word
that our level of...

08:18.866 --> 08:20.499
What is going on
with my mouth?

08:20.501 --> 08:23.602
Looks like you're
a little bit tongue-tied.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.239
I wonder why.

08:27.874 --> 08:28.640
Ah.
Ah.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.843
You've just been
<i>Impossible'd.</i>

08:31.845 --> 08:33.778
You're right.
Masks are fun.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.181
Oh! You son of a bitch.
You did this.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.917
Fact, Double Dragon
is more than penetrable.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.153
The rumors of Contra's demise
were greatly exaggerated.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.990
Now if you'll all
just follow me

08:44.992 --> 08:48.059
for some complimentary
Contra snuggies.

08:50.263 --> 08:54.199
Hey, Mol. Just cooked us
some nice celebratory takeout dinner

08:54.201 --> 08:55.567
for kicking Shaw's ass.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.203
Oh, I think that's you.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.905
Hold on.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.410
Melanie?

09:05.412 --> 09:06.878
Looks like
I'm a little rusty.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.914
What the...
What are you doing here?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.448
Where have you been?
How have you been?

09:10.450 --> 09:12.350
I'll answer
everything after.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.985
After what?

09:15.855 --> 09:19.891
I did everything I could
to try to forget you.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.828
I biked cross-country
with the angels,

09:23.830 --> 09:26.598
I caught some river monsters
in Baja.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.401
Did you have cell service
out there?

09:29.403 --> 09:32.070
I left you
a million messages.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.140
Some of them
kind of embarrassing.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.274
I listened to them.
Oh, yeah?

09:36.276 --> 09:37.876
Mmm-hmm.
But I'm back anyway.

09:37.878 --> 09:41.079
I... I, you know,
I don't know.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.452
Should we do this?

09:48.287 --> 09:49.554
Yeah.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.089
I'm in.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.828
Um, I have something
to tell you.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.098
Cammy, I'm home.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.334
Wait.
Wait a minute.

10:02.336 --> 10:03.935
Have you two been
shagging in my bed?

10:03.937 --> 10:08.607
Oh.  She...
You... You live together?

10:08.609 --> 10:10.842
No. No. No.
I mean, she does.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.078
We do, but only
because we're married.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.779
You're married?
Yes.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.449
She's an illegal alien.
Tell her you're an alien.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.718
Why don't you tell her
you're a wanker?

10:19.720 --> 10:20.285
I'm not a wanker.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.154
Hey. Hold on. So nothing's
happened between you two?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.456
No. I mean,

10:24.458 --> 10:26.691
yeah, we, um, kissed once.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.593
It was nothing.
So now it's nothing?

10:28.595 --> 10:29.894
I knew I shouldn't have
come back here.

10:29.896 --> 10:30.996
This is all
coming out wrong.

10:30.998 --> 10:34.165
Look, I don't... I don't
have feelings for her. Yeah, whatever.

10:37.437 --> 10:41.139
Worst wanking
husband ever.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.678
Cam!

10:47.347 --> 10:49.447
Good morning, sunshine.
Rough night?

10:49.449 --> 10:53.652
Molly kicked me out.
It's a whole thing.

10:53.753 --> 10:55.153
I'm sure it is.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.054
Finding you and Melanie

10:56.056 --> 11:00.025
was probably not the anniversary
present she was hoping for.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.126
Wait.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.127
How'd you know about that?

11:02.129 --> 11:04.162
I bumped into Melanie
this morning.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.630
She was really
pissed off.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.332
I am really pissed off!

11:07.334 --> 11:10.235
Sort of blames me for this whole
marriage thing.

11:10.237 --> 11:14.172
I totally blame you for this whole
marriage thing.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.741
I tried explaining myself,
but she wouldn't hear it.

11:16.743 --> 11:20.111
I don't want to hear it.
Shabba-doo. Shabba-doo.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.113
Wait.
What was that last part?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.548
I realized my story's
sort of boring,

11:23.550 --> 11:26.651
so I figured I'd throw in
a couple of "shabba-doos."

11:26.653 --> 11:29.320
Guys, it's Shaw!
He struck back!

11:29.322 --> 11:32.290
She's drowning
in cheese doodles! Look!

11:32.292 --> 11:35.627
Get me out of here!
I'm allergic to gluten!

11:36.029 --> 11:38.663
All right,
don't worry, Vee.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.965
We'll have you out
in a jiffy pop!

11:40.967 --> 11:43.034
She's a goner.
What do you mean?

11:43.036 --> 11:43.735
My office is a bunker.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.805
That's reinforced glass.
It's bulletproof, shatterproof.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.074
I'll save you, Veronica!

11:49.076 --> 11:52.043
Oh! And Carol-proof.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.545
All right, get on the horn
with 911.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.680
Tell 'em we need
the jaws of life.

11:55.682 --> 11:56.981
Okay.

11:56.983 --> 11:57.449
Shabba-doo!

11:57.451 --> 12:00.051
Shaw locked the vents.
I can't shut down the doodles.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.620
She's gonna be breathing cheese
for the next two hours.

12:02.622 --> 12:03.421
Shh.
What?

12:03.423 --> 12:04.589
I thought you said
it was soundproof.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.992
No. No. Bullet,
shatter, and Carol!

12:20.239 --> 12:21.172
It's been a good ride.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.708
It's just like when Spock
said bye to Captain Kirk

12:23.710 --> 12:27.312
in  <i>Wrath of Khan,</i>
<i>except for with doodles.</i>

12:27.546 --> 12:30.715
I have been
and shall always be

12:30.783 --> 12:33.084
your friend.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.853
No, Ronnie.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.521
No.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.002
Double Dragon
has gone too far.

12:51.004 --> 12:55.240
It's time for a parlay
on neutral territory.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.144
Well, well, well.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.312
Look who came
waving the white flag.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.914
Hope you enjoyed
my latest prank,

13:02.916 --> 13:06.551
courtesy of my gadget guy
Dolla Bill.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.787
Kaboom goes the TNT.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.755
That's not even
how you say it.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.991
Oh, I hate this guy.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.659
This has gone
far enough, Shaw.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.895
You put a woman
in the hospital.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.096
She'll live, but...

13:18.098 --> 13:22.066
It's the worst case of orange lung
I've ever seen.

13:25.204 --> 13:28.006
Wow. It's quite cheesy.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.741
Hey, if you want
this war to end,

13:29.743 --> 13:31.476
all you have to do
is tell the world

13:31.478 --> 13:33.711
that Double Dragon
is number one.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.514
All right, look,

13:36.516 --> 13:38.850
let's settle this
once and for all.

13:38.852 --> 13:42.821
A duel. Whoever wins will
get bragging rights

13:42.823 --> 13:44.722
to say
they are number one.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.490
What do you say, tomorrow,

13:45.492 --> 13:47.192
Contra and Double Dragon
square off

13:47.194 --> 13:51.763
in a contest of strength,
endurance, and athleticism?

13:52.531 --> 13:54.199
Name your game.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.300
Sloshball.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.735
Um, what's sloshball?

13:57.737 --> 14:00.004
It's like kickball,
but with beer,

14:00.006 --> 14:01.739
and we destroy every year.

14:01.741 --> 14:05.710
You only beat us because
you always have a ringer.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.313
Lucky for us,
we've got one, too.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.015
Whoever you've got,
we can handle him.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.851
Not a him.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.452
What?

14:15.654 --> 14:16.955
We just lost.

14:16.957 --> 14:17.455
What? Why?

14:17.457 --> 14:20.158
You should see her
kick a ball.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.866
Oh, my God!
It's still going!

14:29.970 --> 14:31.436
Mel, what are you
doing here?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.605
Same thing you did.
Moving on with my life.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.106
Mel, we're family.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.274
Yeah, we were family,

14:36.276 --> 14:39.677
until he married her,
and you allowed it.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.613
We'll see you on the field
tomorrow, loser.

14:41.615 --> 14:46.618
I'm gonna pound your ass
until I am fully satisfied.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.385
Dude, really?

14:47.387 --> 14:50.321
It's like you're doing it
on purpose.

14:50.789 --> 14:53.691
All right. Here's the rules
of sloshball.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.727
First base,
you drink a beer,

14:55.729 --> 14:57.428
second base,
you drink a beer,

14:57.430 --> 14:59.764
third base...
Drink a beer, perhaps?

14:59.766 --> 15:00.865
You do a keg stand.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.967
Now drink a beer
for interrupting me.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.769
What? No.
Do it! Drink it!

15:04.771 --> 15:06.537
Drink it all!
Take it all down!

15:06.539 --> 15:09.107
Drink it! Drink it!
Drink it!

15:09.109 --> 15:10.575
Okay.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.377
Let's get sloshed!

15:13.780 --> 15:15.680
Hey. I wanted to say
I'm sorry for...

15:22.922 --> 15:25.189
Yeah!

15:26.992 --> 15:28.760
Oh!

15:31.931 --> 15:34.365
Go! Chug! Chug! Yeah!

15:36.101 --> 15:38.002

16:20.347 --> 16:23.614
Come on! Bad sportsmanship,

16:23.616 --> 16:24.882
Cam, what are you doing?

16:24.884 --> 16:26.951
You're not supposed
to be drinking now.

16:26.953 --> 16:27.585
I'm sad.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.388
Get in there.
I'm gonna get another one.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.194
You're going the wrong way!

16:46.339 --> 16:47.739
Okay, slugger, you're up.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.807
Bases are loaded.
One grand slam,

16:49.809 --> 16:53.077
and we're only one grand slam away
from tying this thing.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.046
Oz, we don't have a shot.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.115
They've got Melanie.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.316
It's all my fault.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.183
Hey. Hey. Look.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.219
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

17:01.221 --> 17:04.955
Even if we lose this thing,
we're still gonna win.

17:04.958 --> 17:05.990
Now go get 'em.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.792
Do you wanna get
French fries after this?

17:08.795 --> 17:09.827
Sure.
Yes!

17:09.829 --> 17:12.763
Go get 'em.
Go get 'em.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.232
Come on!

17:14.233 --> 17:15.465
No batter. Ha.

17:15.468 --> 17:19.804
I made love to you,
and you broke my heart!

17:19.806 --> 17:20.471
I made love to you!

17:20.473 --> 17:24.208
Please. Don't embarrass yourself
in front of your wife.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.109
Oh, that is it!
That is it!

17:26.112 --> 17:28.378
I am bringing the heat!
I'm bringing the heat!

17:28.381 --> 17:30.715
Come on! Send it!

18:39.852 --> 18:43.354
You're out!
Double Dragon wins!

18:43.356 --> 18:45.289
Yeah! Ha-ha!

18:46.726 --> 18:47.358
Oh, ho! You lose, Oz!

18:47.360 --> 18:50.561
I shoved it down your throat,
and it felt so good!

18:50.563 --> 18:54.132
I don't even care how that sounds
'cause I'm number one!

18:54.134 --> 18:55.433
I'm not so sure
about that, Shaw.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.736
In order to be number one,
you sort of have to have a company.

18:58.738 --> 18:59.937
What?

18:59.939 --> 19:01.772
Your phone
just got a message.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.308
They just demolished
our servers.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.711
No. There's no way
you broke in.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.212
You never had access!

19:08.214 --> 19:10.047
But I did.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.983
You lose, Shaw.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.252
Boom goes the TNT.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.688
Good morning,
professionals.

19:17.690 --> 19:21.526
I'm fine. Thanks for
the no hospital visits.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.561
Hey, Ronnie!
Welcome back.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.795
Nice to see you
up and about.

19:24.797 --> 19:25.997
You know, we had
the cheese doodles

19:25.999 --> 19:28.833
removed from the vending machine
in honor of you.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.401
Ohh.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.116
Hey.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.751
Just in case I die
from alcohol poisoning,

19:46.753 --> 19:49.954
I wanted to say I'm sorry
for being such an ass.

19:49.956 --> 19:53.758
No, I'm the one who confused how
comfortable we got

19:53.760 --> 19:56.093
for something more.

19:57.729 --> 19:58.563
Look,

19:58.565 --> 20:00.831
I know
you still love her.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.500
Everybody knows.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.036
I'm sorry.
I tried to move on.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.104
Well, don't be.

20:07.306 --> 20:08.406
Now as your wife,

20:08.408 --> 20:11.709
I am instructing you
to stop being such a knob

20:11.711 --> 20:13.811
and go and get the girl.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.346
All right.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.648
Nag, nag, nag.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.084
That's more like it.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.357
Hey.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.694
Dress your bagel?

20:31.763 --> 20:33.898
Thank you, Cash.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.002
Attaboy, Dawson.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.404
So...

20:40.973 --> 20:42.573
You're staying.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.441
Dude, I'm a lock-picker.

20:43.443 --> 20:47.912
It's either this or grinding keys
at a mall kiosk.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.614
Listen, I vaguely remember

20:49.616 --> 20:54.352
yelling some awkward things
at the game, so my bad.

20:54.354 --> 20:58.623
My bad for pegging you
in the head with a ball.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.124
Oh, you loved it.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.159
I really did.

21:02.227 --> 21:06.163
Maybe when I sober up next month,
we could grab a drink.

21:06.165 --> 21:09.433
Well, I don't date
married guys.

21:11.236 --> 21:12.403
But for you,

21:12.405 --> 21:14.839
I'll make an exception.
