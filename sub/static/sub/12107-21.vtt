"A-truck-alypse Now."

00:16.082 --> 00:18.999
This does not sound
like a romantic comedy.

00:18.999 --> 00:19.999
- It's better--

00:19.999 --> 00:22.167
an arena show where mutant
trucks crush each other!

Thanks for being so cool about
me hanging with Lincoln.

I had a brother,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.250
Griselda thinks
she's losing Edwin,

02:46.250 --> 02:47.334
so she makes him jealous,

and he totally
comes crawling back.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.542
But, since three
is an odd number,

03:51.542 --> 03:56.250
I invited someone
to join us--Clyde.

03:56.250 --> 03:58.584

mean, Lincoln?

04:14.250 --> 04:17.500
- I mean this--
he's not even conscious.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.709
Oh, wait a minute.
I get it.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.000
You're trying to
make Bobby jealous

04:22.000 --> 04:23.751
by dragging
poor Clyde around.

04:23.751 --> 04:26.375
- No, I'm not.
- Well, it won't work.

04:26.375 --> 04:28.083
- Yes, it will! I mean--

anything if you'd stop

04:29.584 --> 04:31.999

and give him back to me.

04:31.999 --> 04:33.334
- He's not just
your boyfriend.

04:33.334 --> 04:36.584
He's also the big brother
I've always wanted.

04:36.584 --> 04:38.459
- Let me guess.
He completes you.

04:38.459 --> 04:39.999
- What? I would
never say that.

04:39.999 --> 04:42.834
My point is there's plenty
of Bobby for everyone

04:42.834 --> 04:44.999
and you'd better
get used to sharing him.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.709

No offense, Clyde.

07:58.584 --> 08:01.999
It's just I should be on

- Bobby was right.
You're literally a great bro.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.999
- You'd better get back
to your boyfriend.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.834
- But what are
you gonna do?

09:43.834 --> 09:44.999
- Don't worry about me.

09:44.999 --> 09:48.876
Now that I think about it,
I've already got a bro--Clyde.

09:48.876 --> 09:49.999
Where is he anyway?

09:49.999 --> 09:51.334
- MAN ANNOUNCING: Would
the parents of a soggy boy

09:51.334 --> 09:54.834
with cotton candy in his nose
please come to the medical tent.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.999
- There's my answer.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.375
Clyde, I hope you
didn't feel left out

09:59.375 --> 10:00.918
while I was hanging
with Bobby.

10:00.918 --> 10:03.999
- Are you kidding? I got
to have a date with Lori.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
I just wish I could remember it.
- [knock at door]

10:05.999 --> 10:09.334
- Hey, is Lori here?
- Yeah, come on in.

10:09.334 --> 10:12.751
So, are we cool?
- Totally, dude.

10:13.999 --> 10:16.501
- I appreciate you
being so mature--

10:16.501 --> 10:18.999
especially after
the very romantic date

10:18.999 --> 10:21.417
I'm told I just had
with your lady.

10:21.417 --> 10:23.000
- ALL: Broshake!

10:25.667 --> 10:26.876
- Clyde?
- ALL: [gasping]

10:26.876 --> 10:28.334
- The sister-who-
cannot-be-named

10:28.334 --> 10:29.042
would like to thank you

10:29.042 --> 10:30.501
for hanging out with
her at the fair.

10:30.501 --> 10:32.751
Further, she would like
you to have this gift

10:32.751 --> 10:35.334
as a remembrance of
your time together.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.626
- For me? L-L-Lori?

10:38.626 --> 10:40.000
[thuds, groans]

10:40.000 --> 10:43.999
- That's my bro.
- OTHERS: [laughing]
