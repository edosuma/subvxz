NARRATOR: Previously
on Pretty Little Liars.

00:03.270 --> 00:05.158
I'm cutting you off,
you're over caffeinated.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.737
Hey, Brenda, can I
grab you for a second.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.533
Come see me next week
If you need more.

00:11.210 --> 00:12.768
I signed the agreement.

00:12.810 --> 00:14.630
My dad manipulated you
into signing it.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.649
My mother didn't
kill herself.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.704
It's over.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.718
_All I know is that Alison
IS running out of money

00:20.750 --> 00:22.638
and Shaun is the only one
who knows how to reach her.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.748
I'm tired of lying.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.610
You have to start
thinking of me

00:25.650 --> 00:27.459
as the person
you're closest to.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.082
Oh, A Night in Tunisia.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.154
Forgot the chickpeas.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.384
Oh, I can run
down to Seymour's.

00:31.430 --> 00:34.729
EZRA: Are you okay, I mean, it's
like an hour there and back.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.795
Mr. Fitz.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.634
Want to go right, Spencer.

00:40.670 --> 00:41.762
I think we're being watched.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.607
Ezra.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.672
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.769
You think she started up
with Ezra and didn't tell us.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.539
Had she told you?
Told me what?

00:50.580 --> 00:51.399
Aria.

00:51.450 --> 00:52.144
( gun shot)

00:52.180 --> 00:53.545
Found his journal.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.810
You're saying that Ezra left
that book for us to find.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.249
Which means
he knows we know.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.279
We have to tell Aria.

01:10.730 --> 01:14.461
( clock ticking )

01:33.590 --> 01:35.353
EZRA: Spencer?

01:36.660 --> 01:38.423
Spencer?
Are you alright?

01:40.760 --> 01:42.489
How long
have you been here?

01:42.530 --> 01:44.623
I don't know.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.629
Did you sleep here?

01:47.670 --> 01:48.659
I don't know...

01:48.700 --> 01:49.906
I-- I came in here.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.805
Hey, take it easy.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.478
Let's talk for a second.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.432
I'm fine.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.345
I'm just really
tired, that's all.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.449
Spencer?

01:58.480 --> 02:01.415
We both know
what's going on here.

02:01.450 --> 02:03.611
I think it's time
we address the issue...

02:03.650 --> 02:04.787
don't you?

02:07.260 --> 02:10.787
The path you've been going
down is very dangerous.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.657
( Bell Rings )

02:14.700 --> 02:16.668
I got to go.

02:23.870 --> 02:25.929
* Got a secret
Can you keep It? *

02:25.970 --> 02:28.700
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:28.740 --> 02:31.243
* Better lock it,
in your pocket *

02:31.280 --> 02:33.748
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:33.780 --> 02:35.873
* If I show you
then I know you *

02:35.920 --> 02:38.684
* Won't tell what I said

02:38.720 --> 02:41.257
* Cause two can
keep a secret *

02:41.290 --> 02:43.781
* If one of them
is dead *

02:59.710 --> 03:01.302

03:04.910 --> 03:07.947
HANNA: What are you wearing?

03:07.980 --> 03:09.709
It's nothing, I...
I had to change.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.581
And this is all I had
in my gym locker.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.952
Did you?

03:13.990 --> 03:15.685
Did you have an accident?

03:15.720 --> 03:16.982
What?
No.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.827
Or are you going to?

03:18.860 --> 03:20.293
What's up with those
shower shoes?

03:20.330 --> 03:22.628
Can you just forget
about the outfit, okay.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.626
We have an emergency
situation here.

03:24.670 --> 03:27.298
Is that why
you called me at 4 A.M.?

03:27.340 --> 03:29.262
Wait, what?

03:29.310 --> 03:30.937
Okay, I thought that
after we saw Aria

03:30.970 --> 03:31.959
liplocking with the devil

03:32.010 --> 03:34.274
went home to calm down
and crash.

03:34.310 --> 03:35.538
I...

03:35.580 --> 03:37.571
I must've just hit dial
while I was asleep.

03:37.610 --> 03:39.009
Look, okay,
I know we said

03:39.050 --> 03:40.677
we were going to talk
to Aria after school,

03:40.720 --> 03:43.018
but I really think we need
to tell her about Ezra sooner.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.312
Like, now.

03:44.350 --> 03:45.487
What?

03:45.520 --> 03:46.851
Spencer,
we can't tell her now.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.017
The longer we wait, the more
dangerous it becomes.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.857
And you think
it's any less dangerous

03:50.890 --> 03:53.688
to drop a bomb like that
while she's going into class?

03:53.730 --> 03:54.799
We can't do that to her.

03:54.830 --> 03:56.866
Do what?
Protect her?

03:56.900 --> 03:58.697
Ezra spoke to me
this morning

03:58.730 --> 04:00.539
and I could barely
maintain eye contact.

04:00.570 --> 04:01.969
Meanwhile, for all
we know right now,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.867
Aria is hooking up with him
in some janitor's closet.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.730
How does that not
make your skIn crawl?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.509
It does.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.576
Look, I know you don't want
to keep her in the dark.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.612
Okay, but this isn't
going to be easy.

04:12.650 --> 04:13.548
She's in love with him

04:13.580 --> 04:15.639
and she has given up
a lot to be with him.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.011
I mean,
it's going to be difficult

04:17.050 --> 04:19.518
enough for her to believe
he's even capable of this.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.748
( bell rings )

04:25.660 --> 04:26.922
Aria?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.527
You had a question
about the--

04:30.570 --> 04:31.867
the reading assignment
for the week?

04:31.900 --> 04:33.595
Oh, yeah.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.335
I was just wondering
how much information

04:35.370 --> 04:37.759
we have to turn in
for the exam.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.061
Hey.

04:39.110 --> 04:40.634
Hi.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.931
I know you have
history right now,

04:41.980 --> 04:43.049
but I can write you
a late pass--

04:43.080 --> 04:45.503
That's okay.
What's up?

04:45.550 --> 04:47.643
Have you talked
to Spencer today?

04:49.590 --> 04:50.909
Why?

04:50.950 --> 04:54.613
I feel a little strange
coming to you with this.

04:54.660 --> 04:55.854
Did something happen?

04:55.890 --> 04:57.551
Certain things
have started to...

04:57.590 --> 04:58.921
pile up.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.496
The homework _
Spencer's turning In

05:00.530 --> 05:02.794
is sloppy
and rambling,

05:02.830 --> 05:05.697
she walks in every morning
with circles under her eyes,

05:05.730 --> 05:07.095
I mean, when she's in class,
she's either hyper alert

05:07.140 --> 05:08.960
or she's a total zombie.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.537
Yeah, I mean,
I've noticed

05:11.570 --> 05:13.834
that she's been little
out of it lately.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.678
But she's had
a lot to juggle.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.838
And you know Spencer,
she's a total stress-case.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.814
A garbanzo bean
in the wrong salad bin

05:21.850 --> 05:22.987
is enough to make her
her wig out.

05:23.020 --> 05:23.987
Right.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.089
I think it's more than that.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.553
Like what?

05:26.590 --> 05:28.956
She has a problem
with amphetamines.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.821
And I'm worried
it's become a crutch.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.725
What?

05:32.760 --> 05:34.955
Ezra, that's crazy.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.991
Well, people think
it'll improve

05:37.030 --> 05:38.099
their academic
performance,

05:38.130 --> 05:39.563
but when it's overused--

05:39.600 --> 05:41.898
Ezra,
come on, Spencer?

05:41.940 --> 05:44.033
She's got everybody
fooled, Aria.

05:44.070 --> 05:46.106
Your friend
is a ticking time bomb.

05:46.140 --> 05:47.573
And when she explodes

05:47.610 --> 05:48.907
I don't want you to get hit
by the shrapnel.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.579
I'm sorry,
I can't believe it.

05:51.610 --> 05:54.738
You really think
that she's on drugs?

05:54.780 --> 05:57.544
I don't think it.
I know it.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.058
Look.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.927
I wasn't going
to show you this.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.520
I guess I'm willing
to break the rules

06:06.560 --> 06:07.993
if it means
helping Spencer.

06:10.170 --> 06:14.368
Aria, I'm not trying
to be the bad guy here.

06:29.620 --> 06:30.917
Hey, you.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.711
These are Hanna's clothes.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.580
So long story.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.586
You want to tell me about it
while we go for a ride?

06:38.630 --> 06:40.894
I would love to,
but I've this quiz

06:40.930 --> 06:43.694
right after lunch on the French
succession of popes.

06:43.730 --> 06:44.992
And right now the only thing
I know about them

06:45.030 --> 06:46.793
is that they wore
pointy hats.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.138
I brought us some food.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.608
Are you still mad at me
for taking the money?

06:58.650 --> 06:59.969
No.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.908
No, I was never mad at you.

07:01.950 --> 07:03.781
Disappointed.

07:03.820 --> 07:07.017
I was, maybe a little.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.780
Well, I don't think my mom
would have been disappointed.

07:10.830 --> 07:14.596
I think she would have
wanted me to live my life.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.928
Find a way
to make it full

07:16.970 --> 07:20.690
and share it
with the people I love.

07:24.070 --> 07:26.675
You want to start
by sharing a sandwrch?

07:26.710 --> 07:28.974
Yeah, sounds good.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.840
Are you gonna eat that?

07:37.890 --> 07:39.949
Yeah, I told you that
like five seconds ago.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.821
Just take it.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.158
Thank you.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.690
_ Sorry.
I just get...

07:48.730 --> 07:50.766
I just get extra hungry
when I'm nervous.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.097
I thought it was sad.

07:52.130 --> 07:55.668
I get sad
when I'm nervous.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.600
Look, I've been
avoiding Aria all day.

07:57.640 --> 07:58.664
Like I haven't.

07:58.710 --> 08:02.202
I finished my Spanish
homework in a toilet stall.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.741
Are you sure
this a good idea?

08:03.780 --> 08:04.769
I mean,
what if we tell Aria,

08:04.810 --> 08:06.971
Ezra's "A"
and then she hates us?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.146
What choice do we have

08:08.180 --> 08:10.785
except to prepare
for things to get ugly?

08:10.820 --> 08:11.889
Finally.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.888
Is there some
cellular dead-zone

08:13.920 --> 08:14.887
that you can know
about in the school?

08:14.920 --> 08:16.148
What do you mean?

08:16.190 --> 08:18.988
Well, I've texted you
both like five times.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.994
Whatever,
where's Spencer?

08:22.030 --> 08:23.588
I haven't seen her.

08:23.630 --> 08:24.722
Okay.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.091
Well, we need to find her
and talk to her right now.

08:29.140 --> 08:30.960
What about?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.001
Right, I think we all know
that Spencer's been a little...

08:33.040 --> 08:34.871
extra-intense lately.

08:34.910 --> 08:36.070
And I'd just chalked
it up to stress,

08:36.110 --> 08:38.601
but she's not distressed.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.311
She's strung out.

08:40.350 --> 08:43.786
You guys, Spencer
has a serious problem.

08:43.820 --> 08:47.085
All right, and this isn't the
first time that has happened.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.008
Two years ago
it was enough of an issue

08:49.060 --> 08:51.858
that her parents had
to ask the school for help.

08:51.890 --> 08:52.993
Look.

09:11.650 --> 09:12.639
Is that okay?

09:12.680 --> 09:17.014
I'm just really tired.

09:17.050 --> 09:18.779
Why don't you
come over tonight?

09:18.820 --> 09:21.618
I'll get us take out
from Bucali's.

09:21.660 --> 09:22.957
Rent a movie.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.878
Maybe even throw a massage
in there if you're good

09:24.930 --> 09:26.818
and you finish
all your lasagna.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.919
That sounds
amazrng, I just...

09:28.960 --> 09:30.325
I can't tonight.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.689
Then tomorrow.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.797
We need some time together.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.364
I know.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.936
( Bell Rings )

09:40.840 --> 09:42.774
That's okay.
I got that.

09:42.810 --> 09:44.573
Thank you.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.058
I'd almost forgotten
your smell.

09:58.790 --> 09:59.791
See you later.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.833
SPENCER: Okay.

10:07.870 --> 10:11.806
Two diets
and a regular, right?

10:16.750 --> 10:17.739
Oh my God.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.873
You guys did it
already, didn't you?

10:23.750 --> 10:25.115
Did what?

10:25.150 --> 10:26.242
Nothing.

10:26.290 --> 10:27.359
We're not here
to talk about that.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.688
We're here to talk about...

10:29.730 --> 10:31.755
something else.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.098
Spence, we're concerned.

10:33.130 --> 10:36.099
Yeah, I know.
We're concerned.

10:36.130 --> 10:39.122
No, we're worried
about you.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.899
Me?
Why?

10:40.940 --> 10:41.895
Are you a speed freak?

10:41.940 --> 10:42.804
Hanna.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.000
Spencen

10:44.040 --> 10:46.133
Have you been taking pills
to stay awake?

10:46.170 --> 10:48.934
Where is this coming from?

10:48.980 --> 10:50.845
What the hell
is happening right now?

10:50.880 --> 10:52.142
We care about you.

10:52.180 --> 10:55.741
Yeah, would you
and that's why we're here.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.714
Right, this is kind of like
an intervention.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.286
Yeah, I know.
Yours.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.084
Spencer, stop.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.022
We know this has been
problem for you before.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.824
I don't know_what
you guys are talking about.

11:17.770 --> 11:19.874
Where'd you get this?

11:19.910 --> 11:22.435
Ezra.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.778
He's worried about you.

11:24.810 --> 11:28.143
You're kidding me, right?

11:28.180 --> 11:30.910
And you two didn't tell her?

11:30.950 --> 11:33.453
He's "A," Aria!

11:33.490 --> 11:34.752
Ezra is Board Shorts.

11:34.790 --> 11:35.950
He tried to kill Ali

11:35.990 --> 11:37.787
and he's been torturing us
ever since.

11:37.830 --> 11:38.819
Spencer,
can we please stick

11:38.860 --> 11:40.452
to the subject of you
for right now.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.922
How can you not see
what's happening right now.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.393
He's trying to undermine me.

11:43.430 --> 11:45.091
He's being "A"!

11:48.500 --> 11:51.435
Please tell me you see
what's happening here.

11:51.470 --> 11:56.476
Ezra said that he found you
passed out in school today.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.478
That you were barefoot,
you were in your pajamas,

11:58.510 --> 12:00.774
and you didn't even know
where you were.

12:00.820 --> 12:04.017
Spencer, is that true
or is it not true?

12:05.890 --> 12:07.812
Yes.
Okay.

12:07.860 --> 12:08.952
I slept walked.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.457
To school?
Yes.

12:10.490 --> 12:13.493
And I've taken a couple
of pills a few times.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.191
And it's not great,
I know,

12:15.230 --> 12:16.959
but it's not
that big of a deal.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.820
And Ezra is just trying
to make it into a bigger deal

12:18.870 --> 12:20.997
than it is because he's trying
to get the focus off himself

12:21.040 --> 12:23.008
because he's freaking "A"!

12:24.110 --> 12:27.102
Oh, my God.
This is brilliant.

12:27.140 --> 12:29.131
All right, I know that
you're feeling cornered.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.477
Oh, God, Aria.

12:30.510 --> 12:31.943
Will you wake up?

12:31.980 --> 12:33.470
This is exactly
the kind of deer

12:33.520 --> 12:35.374
in the headlights behavior
that almost got you shot

12:35.420 --> 12:37.741
in the back of a night club.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.378
What night club?

12:40.420 --> 12:43.821
I mean...
Iam...

12:43.860 --> 12:45.054
Okay, I'm confused,

12:45.090 --> 12:49.459
but the point is
that I'm not crazy, okay.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.865
You just don't see.

12:50.900 --> 12:54.768
How can you guys not see
what's happening.

12:55.970 --> 12:58.359
I can't deal
with this right now.

13:07.450 --> 13:08.474
Wren?

13:08.520 --> 13:10.112
He's your hook-up?

13:10.150 --> 13:11.549
Why did you just
swipe the pad?

13:11.590 --> 13:14.058
It's not mine.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.217
I've never even
seen that before.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.165
MIKE: I bet
you are a cute baby.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.508
Oh, not really.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.531
I had to start wearing
corrective lenses

13:32.570 --> 13:33.935
when I was
still teething.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.208
Yeah, that sounds adorable.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.174
No, it really wasn't.

13:37.210 --> 13:42.011
No, I cannot believe
I admitted that.

13:42.050 --> 13:43.483
I must really like you.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.545
Like?

13:45.590 --> 13:47.581
I was...

13:47.620 --> 13:49.451
was kind of hoping
you'd say that other word.

13:50.590 --> 13:53.127
The one that
rhymes With glove?

13:59.500 --> 14:02.230
I didn't mean to go there.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.101
I think the candlelight
is getting to me.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.941
So do you want to split
the steak and fries

14:16.990 --> 14:20.414
or were you more
into the chicken?

14:21.690 --> 14:24.386
Mona?

14:24.430 --> 14:25.454
A steak.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.890
Steak sounds great.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.421
I'll be right back.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.097
Ijust...
I have to talk to Mr. Fitz

14:32.130 --> 14:33.597
about a reading assignment.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.978
Hello, Mona.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.501
What are you doing here?

14:43.550 --> 14:46.974
I'm getting
something to eat.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.375
Look.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.479
I can't help you anymore.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.657
Why's that?

14:53.690 --> 14:57.558
It's gotten too complicated.

14:57.590 --> 15:00.127
It's always been
complicated, Mona.

15:00.160 --> 15:04.460
That's a little too late
to back out espeCIally now,

15:04.500 --> 15:06.127
when I need your help.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.131
MAN: Ezra?

15:09.170 --> 15:10.501
That's me.

15:12.710 --> 15:13.904
Thank you.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.102
Enjoy your dinner.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.040
So did Aria text you?

15:22.080 --> 15:23.718
Yeah.
She said she's staying in.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.388
Can we believe her?

15:25.420 --> 15:26.580
Why?

15:26.620 --> 15:28.656
You think she's going
to go see Ezra?

15:28.690 --> 15:33.150
Spencer may have
an addiction, but so does Aria.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.519
Love is a drug too.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.198
And who says Ezra doesn't
put Aria in a--

15:36.230 --> 15:37.561
what do you call it?

15:37.600 --> 15:40.068
Altered state.
Yeah, exactly.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.637
I think Aria kept her
habit a secret, too.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.467
It's a classic druggie move.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.159
So what are you saying?

15:46.210 --> 15:47.575
You still think
that Ezra is "A"?

15:47.610 --> 15:49.601
There's too_ much
eVIdence against him.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.699
We found the Book of
Revelations in his desk.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.718
Yeah, but what if that was
a plan from the real "A",

15:53.750 --> 15:55.513
trying to make
Fitz look guilty.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.517
"A's" does that.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.518
( Door Knocking )

16:00.490 --> 16:01.582
Can I come in?

16:01.620 --> 16:03.258
Please.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.463
That's all of them.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.139
I don't need them anymore.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.538
Are you sure?

16:19.570 --> 16:20.776
Yeah.

16:20.810 --> 16:24.041
Look, I know that
my credibility with you guys

16:24.080 --> 16:29.712
kind of got decimated today,
but Ezra is "A".

16:29.750 --> 16:30.717
I'm sure of it.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.218
Maybe you are.
But we're not.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.581
I know that.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.453
And all I'm asking
is for the chance

16:38.490 --> 16:40.048
to prove it to you.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.624
I've been studying
all the changes.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.594
And I think "A" is trying
to cover up the place

16:44.630 --> 16:46.097
where he used
to meet Ali.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.097
The Hart and Huntsman?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.596
No.
Somewhere else.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.403
A place where they can meet
and not be seen.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.101
See this?

16:52.140 --> 16:54.233
Still thinking of
Ambrose Pearson."

16:54.280 --> 16:56.077
Right, but that's not
what it used to say.

16:56.110 --> 16:59.477
Originally it said "still
thinking of Ambrose Pavilion."

16:59.510 --> 17:02.149
"A" changed it so that would
sound more like a person's name

17:02.180 --> 17:03.681
so_ that instead of
looking for a location,

17:03.720 --> 17:05.813
we'd be searching
for a guy.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.784
Yeah, some weirdo
named Ambrose.

17:07.820 --> 17:08.718
Right.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.524
_So_ Ambrose Pavilion
IS In NorrIstown Zoo.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.448
So how does that prove
that Ezra is "A"?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.728
It doesn't.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.524
But "A" already knows
that Ali's still alive.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.128
And "A" knows
that she never got that money

17:19.170 --> 17:21.491
in the coffee bag
that she needed from Shana.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.462
So all we _have to do is
convmce him

17:23.510 --> 17:26.138
that Ali's going to meet us
at Ambrose Pavilion to get it.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.230
And you think the person
showing up will be Ezra.

17:33.180 --> 17:38.516
Yeah, I could do dinner
if it's on the early side.

17:38.550 --> 17:40.450
Okay, great.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.151
I'll be leaving
in five minutes.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.828
All right, bye.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.523
Have you been
in your room all day?

17:48.560 --> 17:50.096
Yeah.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.431
It started out as a nap.

17:53.470 --> 17:54.835
I'm leaving to play
a round-robin

17:54.870 --> 17:56.167
with Tricia and Joan.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.167
Wish me luck.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.235
Good luck.

17:59.270 --> 18:02.103
Are you still going to join
us at the club for dinner?

18:02.140 --> 18:04.745
Oh, I'm totally spaced.

18:04.780 --> 18:08.477
Toby really wants me for
dinner at his place tonight.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.283
Okay, fine.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.185
But at least come up
with a better excuse

18:12.220 --> 18:13.756
for me to give
next time.

18:13.790 --> 18:14.779
Okay.

18:14.820 --> 18:15.889
Love you.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.148
Love you, too.

18:17.190 --> 18:19.852
Good luck.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.790
( Phone Rings )

18:30.810 --> 18:33.529
VOICEMAIL: Hey, it's Toby.
Leave message.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.707
Hi.
It's me.

18:35.740 --> 18:36.877
Change of plans.

18:36.910 --> 18:39.208
My mom is forcing me
to go to dinner

18:39.250 --> 18:42.469
with her country club
cronies tonight so.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.181
I might be able
to make it by after,

18:44.220 --> 18:46.188
gonna be on the later side.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.181
I mean, she was
just so desperate.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.583
At first she
totally denied it,

18:51.630 --> 18:54.497
and then she just completely
flew off the handle.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.828
When I was getting
my teaching certificate,

18:56.860 --> 18:59.465
they had us practice
confrontations,

18:59.500 --> 19:00.637
that could be
really difficult,

19:00.670 --> 19:03.662
people become
really defensive.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.302
Defensive?

19:05.340 --> 19:08.571
No, she slid past defense
and went straight to offense.

19:08.610 --> 19:10.248
She attacked me,
she attacked Emily and Hanna,

19:10.280 --> 19:12.305
and she even went as far--

19:15.250 --> 19:17.309
She went
as far as to say what?

19:19.590 --> 19:21.217
She's just...

19:21.260 --> 19:23.148
she's _out of
control right now.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.797
You know,
I think it's time

19:32.830 --> 19:36.163
to tell Spencer's parents
about what's going on.

19:38.740 --> 19:39.900
Oh, god.

19:39.940 --> 19:41.703
No, I don't want
to have to do that.

19:41.740 --> 19:43.776
If you don't,
I'll have to.

19:43.810 --> 19:44.947
And it becomes
a much bigger deal

19:44.980 --> 19:46.504
if a teacher
gets Involved.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.609
But can't we just let her
figure this out on her own?

19:48.650 --> 19:52.643
Aria, Spencer doesn't
remember driving to school.

19:52.690 --> 19:53.714
She could have
killed someone.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.284
I know.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.810
I know that.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.829
But she's a really
strong person.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.999
And I promise you,
she'll get herself out of this.

20:02.030 --> 20:03.918
At what cost?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.460
Do you remember Radley?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.866
Yes.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.461
She thought she found
Toby, dead in the woods.

20:11.510 --> 20:12.829
That's exactly my point.

20:12.870 --> 20:15.805
Seeing a motorcycle helmet
and a tattoo

20:15.840 --> 20:19.469
is enough to unravel her
completely.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.484
You're right.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.825
Hey.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.725
How did you find
out about that?

20:37.770 --> 20:41.638
The tattoo part?

20:41.670 --> 20:42.762
What do you mean?

20:44.670 --> 20:47.468
I mean, how did you know
that Spencer only saw

20:47.510 --> 20:50.502
the helmet and a tattoo?

20:50.550 --> 20:51.744
I just don't think
that was included

20:51.780 --> 20:54.874
in any of the reports
or anything.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.515
I think you must
have told me.

21:00.690 --> 21:02.248
Yeah.
I probably did.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.648
Can I top you off?

21:24.680 --> 21:27.547
Oh, no. I'm good, Emily.
Thanks.

( Phone Rings )

21:37.090 --> 21:38.785
Hey.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.752
Yeah, I can't
talk right now.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.598
Can I call you back?

21:43.630 --> 21:47.066
Seriously, now is
not a good time.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.465
No, I know,
I just...

21:48.500 --> 21:49.967
I don't know
ifI can do it.

21:53.010 --> 21:56.036
We don't even know if Ali's
actually going to show up.

21:57.610 --> 21:59.669
Nice.
I think he's listening.

21:59.710 --> 22:00.870
Oh, he's definitely
listening.

22:00.920 --> 22:01.944
Okay.

22:01.980 --> 22:03.743
Now say something like.

22:03.790 --> 22:04.939
"I know she
needs some money,

22:04.990 --> 22:06.548
but it's too dangerous."

22:06.590 --> 22:08.478
EMILY ( on phone): I know
she needs some money,

22:08.520 --> 22:09.612
but it's too dangerous.

22:13.730 --> 22:18.565
Tell her to get closer
to this mush fries.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.329
Just in case he can hear.

22:22.670 --> 22:24.968
Just mention
the location--

22:25.010 --> 22:27.979
Yeah, I heard you.

22:28.010 --> 22:29.932
Ambrose Pavilion closing.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.743

23:05.810 --> 23:06.902
Hi, good afternoon,

23:06.950 --> 23:08.577
this is Veronica Hastings

23:08.620 --> 23:11.009
calling on behalf
of my daughter Spencer.

23:11.050 --> 23:14.087

her prescription today.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.681
If you would, would you
please give me a call back at--

23:17.730 --> 23:21.552

from Dr. Griggs's office.

24:35.570 --> 24:36.730
Dr. Griggs?

24:36.770 --> 24:37.998
I spoke to the doctor

24:38.040 --> 24:39.530
and he'd really be
more comfortable

24:39.570 --> 24:40.901
if Spencer came in
to see him

24:40.940 --> 24:42.703
before he re-ups
her prescription.

24:42.740 --> 24:43.946
There must be
some mIstake

24:43.980 --> 24:45.845
we haven't seen
Dr. GrIggs In years.

24:45.880 --> 24:50.647
I have it here that
you've called several times.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.817

24:54.860 --> 24:56.953

Oh, over there.

25:24.150 --> 25:25.117
Hanna.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.879
I can't.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.989
I'm sorry,
just looking at the sign

25:28.020 --> 25:29.749
gives me heebie-jeebies.

25:29.790 --> 25:32.884
You'll be fine.
They're all behind glass.

25:35.030 --> 25:36.019
Hanna, come on.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.823

to be scared of.

The snake is so cool.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.115
Do you think it eats mice?

27:03.150 --> 27:07.348
Yeah.

27:07.390 --> 27:09.119
The black mamba...

27:09.160 --> 27:11.355
Only Ali would think
it's sew to make out

27:11.390 --> 27:13.085
in front of
a bunch of reptiles.

27:13.130 --> 27:14.950
BOY: That one is sleeping.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.399
Come on.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.128
Can you just toss that thing
so we can get out of here.

27:27.170 --> 27:28.671
No.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.405
We have to wait for Spencer
to get into position.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.101
Where is she?

27:38.050 --> 27:39.847
I don't know.

27:39.890 --> 27:42.688
She should have
been here by now.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.894
What a gyp.

27:47.930 --> 27:50.728
There's nothing in this one
except a log covered in goo.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.799
Oh, my god.

28:35.010 --> 28:35.999
EZRA'S VOICE: The first
thing Alison ever told me

28:36.040 --> 28:38.474
about herself was a lie.

28:38.510 --> 28:41.479
Lying was her owgen.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.078
She could do it while
she was laughing.

28:43.120 --> 28:46.715
She could even do it
when she was kissing you.

28:48.790 --> 28:51.850
ANNOUNCEMENT: The zoo
will close in 5 minutes.

28:51.890 --> 28:53.858

28:53.900 --> 28:56.027
She wouldn't have
gotten It wrong.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.425
HANNA: There's Spencer.

29:00.470 --> 29:03.132

30:55.120 --> 30:56.849

31:00.350 --> 31:03.922
Aria, I know
you're out there.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.622
Why are you hiding from me?

31:06.660 --> 31:08.958
Aria.

31:44.430 --> 31:45.419
(Phone Rings )

32:06.020 --> 32:07.112
Aria.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.051
Aria!

32:15.100 --> 32:16.089
Why are you doing this?

32:16.130 --> 32:18.462
Just come out
and talk to me.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.164
Please, just don't do this.

32:23.200 --> 32:27.204
Please come out
and talk to me.

32:47.490 --> 32:51.199
Why isn't Spencer
doing anything?

32:51.230 --> 32:53.664
She'll make her move
when she thinks "A" is here.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.639
And you think that
it's going to be Ezra

32:58.670 --> 33:00.365
who shows up?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.539
Guess we'll find out soon.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.373
Okay, once Spencer
gives us the signal,

33:08.420 --> 33:10.513
we'll double-back.

33:12.150 --> 33:13.583
God, you guys.
I'm so sorry, I'm late.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.053

Damn it!

33:49.560 --> 33:50.618
Gosh.
She was just here.

33:50.660 --> 33:52.548

34:39.910 --> 34:41.434
You have to leave.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.175
Sorry.

34:43.210 --> 34:45.542
We got locked in.
We're going now.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.487
The Anaconda is the largest
snake in the world.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.559
Help!
Somebody help me!

34:58.590 --> 35:00.558
Stop, stop. Please, please,
I know you're upset,

35:00.590 --> 35:01.727
but just hear me out.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.591
Don't touch me.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.859
Why did we stop?

35:07.900 --> 35:10.494
I know what you saw back
there, and I can explain it.

35:10.540 --> 35:12.861
You knew Alison.
You knew here.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.128
You pretended not to,
and you're--

35:15.180 --> 35:18.240
Yes, yes.
I know, I lied.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.599
I'm so sorry.

35:19.650 --> 35:24.144
I wanted to tell you so many
times, but I was afraid.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.646
I was afraid that you
wouldn't forgive me.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.750
I met Alison in college.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.520
She lied about her age
and I believed her.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.788
I don't want to hear this.
I don't want to hear it.

35:33.830 --> 35:34.592
I just want to get off.

35:34.630 --> 35:36.188
Aria, please,
just listen to me.

35:36.230 --> 35:40.189
Nothing you say
will change anything.

35:40.230 --> 35:42.198
I don't even know
who you are.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.265
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.

35:45.470 --> 35:47.461
You wanted Alison dead.

35:47.510 --> 35:48.636
You wanted her dead.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.635
You thought
you got her pregnant.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.477
I never hurt Alison.

35:51.510 --> 35:53.569
I was writing
a book about her.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.386
A true crime book.

35:58.420 --> 36:00.638
A book?

36:00.690 --> 36:02.214
Yeah.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.559
When I saw in the papers
that she had gone missing,

36:05.590 --> 36:07.751
I-- I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.849
I had to get
to the bottom of the story.

36:15.970 --> 36:18.803
Did you know
who I was when we met?

36:18.840 --> 36:20.535
Yes, I did.

36:20.570 --> 36:22.435
I knew who all of you were.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.970
And that's why I applied
to teach at Rosewood.

36:24.010 --> 36:27.548
So that's what I was to you?

36:27.580 --> 36:29.548
I was research?

36:29.580 --> 36:31.616
When I saw you in the bar,

36:31.650 --> 36:33.686
I took advantage
of an opportunity

36:33.720 --> 36:34.948
because I wanted
to be a good reporter.

36:34.990 --> 36:36.514
I wanted to be the guy

36:36.560 --> 36:38.585
that would do anything
for the story,

36:38.630 --> 36:41.497
but I promise you though.

36:41.530 --> 36:44.693
I didn't know I was going
to fall in love with you.

36:44.730 --> 36:46.823
Don't.

36:46.870 --> 36:48.462
I lied about
a lot of things.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.593
Ezra, don't!

36:52.510 --> 36:55.229
I lied about
a lot of things.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.601
But I have never lied to you,
not once

36:57.640 --> 36:59.744
about how I feel about you.

37:03.650 --> 37:04.685
When we started
gettIng serIous,

37:04.720 --> 37:06.517
I stopped writing the book.

37:06.550 --> 37:08.256
I started my research back up
again when we broke up

37:08.290 --> 37:10.258
and that's how I knew
that Alison was still alive.

37:10.290 --> 37:12.622
When I think about
how I defended you

37:12.660 --> 37:17.597
to my family
and my friends.

37:17.630 --> 37:20.463
And the whole
tIme you were...

37:20.500 --> 37:21.797
you were using me.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.035
I'm sorry,
I'm such an idiot.

37:24.070 --> 37:25.958
I'm such an idiot.
I'm a jerk.

37:26.010 --> 37:30.674
But I swear,
I'll burn this, I'll trash it.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.575
Burn it?

37:32.610 --> 37:33.747
Burn it?

37:33.780 --> 37:35.611
Are you kidding me?

37:35.650 --> 37:39.438
I'm going to read this thing
from cover to cover.

37:39.490 --> 37:40.809
Aria, please don't.

37:40.850 --> 37:41.851
No.

37:41.890 --> 37:43.016
No, I want to know
what was worth

37:43.060 --> 37:45.528
destroying everything
we had for.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.482
Look.

37:47.530 --> 37:48.792
No!

38:05.810 --> 38:07.675
I was going to say you
missed half the movie,

38:07.710 --> 38:11.749
but that was like
20 minutes ago.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.779
I'm sorry.

38:12.820 --> 38:15.709
Kind of lost track of time.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.928
Well, can we watch the rest?

38:18.960 --> 38:20.951
I don't mind being
a little lost.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.992
Well, you won't be.

38:23.030 --> 38:25.692
Movie is about a creepy guy
who makes creepy sculptures

38:25.730 --> 38:27.823
and acts creepy about it.

38:31.940 --> 38:33.828
I'm gonna get a refill.

38:33.870 --> 38:35.804
You want something?

38:35.840 --> 38:37.808
No, thanks.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.081
Aria?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.951
Are you okay?

39:12.950 --> 39:14.713
Toby.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.885
Hey, what
are you doing here?

39:22.960 --> 39:24.825
Your mom was
worrIed about you.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.829
Why would my mom be
worried about me?

39:27.860 --> 39:29.623
She called me,
looking for you.

39:29.660 --> 39:33.118
I wish you could have told me
what was really going on,

39:33.170 --> 39:34.797
instead of me
finding out this way.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.958
VERONICA: Spencer?
Is that you?

39:39.010 --> 39:41.570
I guess I'll give you guys
some time to talk.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.739
This is for you.

39:47.150 --> 39:50.017
There was a whole dinner
that went with it, but...

39:50.050 --> 39:51.779
doesn't matter.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.812
Wait, Toby.
Can you just wait a second?

39:54.860 --> 39:56.919
I wasn't trying
to ditch you.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.757
Goodbye, Toby.

39:58.790 --> 40:00.052
Thank you for coming over.

40:00.090 --> 40:02.752
Good night, Mrs. Hastings.

40:13.110 --> 40:15.704
Mom, why did you ask
Toby here?

40:15.740 --> 40:18.846
You promised.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.440
You promised you wouldn't
go back to this again.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.710
Go back to what?
I don't know what you mean.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.741
Spencer, stop it.

40:27.850 --> 40:30.819
Dr. Griggs's office
called, I know.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.723
Mom, I'm sorry.

40:34.760 --> 40:38.799
I can't go through
this with you again.

40:38.830 --> 40:40.525
I just don't think
I have it in me.

40:40.570 --> 40:41.992
It's not like last time
though, I swear.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.032
You didn't know what you
were doing half the time.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.577
And your father and I
can't cover for you again,

40:50.610 --> 40:51.872
not with Radley
on your resume.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.844
What's that
supposed to mean?

40:53.880 --> 40:56.542
I need to call your father.
Let him know you're okay.

40:56.580 --> 41:00.949
It sounds like Toby had
a beautiful evening planned.

41:00.990 --> 41:02.719
It's too bad
you missed it.

41:26.980 --> 41:31.747
* I know that
you'll never change *

41:34.890 --> 41:39.520
* So you should go out
separate way *

41:42.930 --> 41:45.524
* All these illusions

41:45.570 --> 41:50.860
* All of these lies

41:50.900 --> 41:56.873
* Even your friends say

41:56.910 --> 42:01.006
* You'll make me cry
upon my myself *

42:01.050 --> 42:05.009
* I can hurt and impart

42:05.050 --> 42:09.282
* Don't make me fall
on my knees *

42:09.320 --> 42:14.997
* When you break it

42:15.030 --> 42:20.718
* Set me free every time

42:20.770 --> 42:26.629
* You're nothing but trouble

42:26.670 --> 42:28.831
* You're nothing but trouble

42:33.080 --> 42:35.776
* You're nothing but trouble

42:38.820 --> 42:41.880
* You're nothing but trouble
