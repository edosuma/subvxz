Previously on This Is Us...

00:01.876 --> 00:05.160
‭You know what I thought of the
first time I heard your name?

00:05.680 --> 00:07.828
I thought of the expression "déjà vu."

00:07.960 --> 00:10.545
'Cause you remind me a little of myself

00:10.570 --> 00:11.628
when I was your age.

00:11.653 --> 00:12.952
They dropped the charges.

00:13.224 --> 00:14.453
I'm here for my daughter.

00:14.625 --> 00:18.390
I've got this big,
amazing, beautiful life.

00:18.647 --> 00:19.779
Bye, Randall.

00:21.178 --> 00:23.328
And if I'm seeing me in you...

00:23.375 --> 00:24.640
We just want to make sure

00:24.665 --> 00:27.066
that you're safe
and you're well taken care of.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.632
Uh, we're making it work.

00:29.045 --> 00:30.784
...if seeing you is giving me that

00:30.809 --> 00:33.000
sweet, sweet déjà vu feeling,

00:34.009 --> 00:36.531
I think that means it's gonna
happen for you, too.

00:40.012 --> 00:41.745
Grandma, I'm scared.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.429
Oh, baby, there's nothing
to be scared of.

00:43.454 --> 00:44.757
I was here with your mama.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.545
Feels like yesterday.

00:46.937 --> 00:48.695
Feels like déjà vu.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.656
- Uh-huh.
- Baby. Listen.

00:56.325 --> 00:58.942
All right, Rebecca,
one more big push, now.

00:59.028 --> 01:00.203
There you go.

01:00.312 --> 01:02.406
Keep pushing, keep pushing.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.601
All right.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.031
There you go.

First male is out,

01:20.149 --> 01:21.617
and he is looking good...

01:21.656 --> 01:24.234
You hear that, baby? We got a boy!
We got a boy!

01:24.259 --> 01:25.757
We got a boy...

01:31.277 --> 01:33.398
Welcome to the world, Deja.

01:47.593 --> 01:50.428
Grandma, I-I can't. Told
you, my back's still sore.

01:50.453 --> 01:51.773
Yes, your back.

01:52.757 --> 01:54.695
I heard you the last two times.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.742
I'll get the nurse to get you
something for your pain.

01:58.414 --> 02:00.945
But I need for you
to hold your daughter.

02:01.114 --> 02:02.359
Get to know her.

02:02.384 --> 02:04.875
- Let her get to know you.
- She grew inside me.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.427
I think we know each other pretty well.

02:06.451 --> 02:09.179
No. No. No, you don't. Not really.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.689
You have to hold her.

02:12.179 --> 02:15.398
You will never forget the first
time you bond with your baby.

02:15.423 --> 02:17.140
Grandma, I'm just tired.

02:17.165 --> 02:18.476
You ain't tired.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.250
You're just upset with Dennis.

02:21.421 --> 02:23.551
You and your mom are just the same...

02:23.637 --> 02:25.436
always worried about some boy.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.889
But, baby girl, I'm gonna
straight-talk you now.

02:28.195 --> 02:30.007
I know you're only 16,

02:30.281 --> 02:32.335
but playtime is over.

02:33.328 --> 02:35.420
And it's time for you to grow up.

02:35.445 --> 02:36.984
This child is here now,

02:37.273 --> 02:39.820
and she deserves a mother
who will put her first.

02:41.833 --> 02:42.945
So...

02:43.708 --> 02:44.875
Mm.

02:47.093 --> 02:50.368
Watch her head. Watch her head.

03:37.898 --> 03:38.912
G.G.!

03:38.937 --> 03:41.515
Deja, what you doing up?

03:41.823 --> 03:44.481
It's almost midnight. Where's your mama?

03:48.960 --> 03:49.967
Scoot.

03:49.992 --> 03:51.304
Come on. Scoot.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.984
Baby girl,

03:58.266 --> 04:00.149
did you give away my brooch?

04:00.234 --> 04:02.943
- Mr. Bear's just borrowing it.
- Well, he'd better take

04:02.968 --> 04:06.803
real good care of it,
because I know where he lives.

04:08.251 --> 04:10.101
Mwah!

04:10.515 --> 04:12.093
Mmm!

04:14.648 --> 04:15.804
Okay,

04:16.077 --> 04:17.312
what we gonna read tonight?

04:17.601 --> 04:18.701
Goodnight Moon.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.370
Goodnight Moon! Good choice!

04:21.394 --> 04:22.827
That's my favorite.

04:23.070 --> 04:24.648
Let me see. Uh...

04:24.851 --> 04:26.570
Ah, here it is.

04:27.390 --> 04:28.611
Okay.

04:31.879 --> 04:32.968
Now...

04:33.070 --> 04:36.296
"In the great green room

04:36.898 --> 04:38.320
There was a telephone

04:39.007 --> 04:40.703
And a red balloon

04:41.460 --> 04:43.459
And a picture of the cow..."

04:47.187 --> 04:48.906
"...jumping over the moon."

04:49.804 --> 04:53.273
"And there were three
little bears sitting on chairs

04:54.382 --> 04:56.210
And two little kittens

04:57.046 --> 04:58.398
And a pair of mittens."

04:58.781 --> 05:03.265
"And a comb and a brush
and a bowl full of mush

05:03.671 --> 05:08.226
And a quiet old lady
who was whispering 'hush.'"

05:08.555 --> 05:10.021
"Goodnight room

05:10.968 --> 05:12.179
Goodnight moon

05:13.359 --> 05:15.437
Goodnight cow jumping over the moon

05:15.898 --> 05:17.228
Goodnight light

05:17.297 --> 05:18.726
And the red balloon."

05:19.132 --> 05:22.257
"And goodnight noises...

05:24.258 --> 05:25.632
everywhere."

05:44.648 --> 05:46.804
Why was that child
left alone in this house?

05:46.829 --> 05:49.000
Aw, Grandma, come on.

05:49.306 --> 05:51.078
I tucked her in, I put her to bed.

05:51.103 --> 05:52.601
I was just at Brandon's.

05:54.362 --> 05:55.812
His place is two blocks from here.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.921
I could practically see her from there.

05:58.523 --> 06:00.679
I was with Deja all day.
I just thought...

06:00.704 --> 06:03.942
You thought that you could just
feed her some cold-ass pizza

06:03.967 --> 06:06.071
and put on a hoochie dress
and go out and have some fun?

06:06.095 --> 06:08.171
You don't have to talk to me
like that. I'm not a child.

06:08.195 --> 06:09.454
Oh, so you think you grown?

06:09.540 --> 06:11.140
- I'm 19.
- Oh, so you

06:11.165 --> 06:12.814
grown enough to clean up around here

06:12.839 --> 06:14.554
without me having to stare you down?

06:14.579 --> 06:16.064
- I do clean up.
- When?

06:16.089 --> 06:17.289
Why you always saying I don't clean up?

06:17.313 --> 06:18.825
Well, you grown enough to
pay one of these bills?

06:18.849 --> 06:19.981
Because you use everything

06:20.050 --> 06:21.750
and you pay for nothing.

06:22.219 --> 06:24.435
- You think I like living off of you?
- I don't know,

06:24.460 --> 06:26.696
Shauna, because you're sure in
hell not trying to change that.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.319
If I could, I would.

06:28.558 --> 06:30.438
I would be in college
right now with my friends.

06:30.493 --> 06:32.023
I wouldn't be here raising no baby.

06:32.048 --> 06:33.710
Well, I didn't think
you'd be here either.

06:54.171 --> 06:55.319
I'm sorry.

07:03.015 --> 07:04.179
I know.

07:04.351 --> 07:07.312
Do I use whole or canned tomatoes?

07:07.648 --> 07:08.742
- Both.
- Both.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.968
I can't carry this for you.

07:11.810 --> 07:12.929
Not forever.

07:25.549 --> 07:26.698
G.G.?

07:26.890 --> 07:28.117
I'm okay, baby.

07:37.503 --> 07:38.812
Grandma.

07:41.054 --> 07:42.381
Grandma.

07:43.179 --> 07:45.210
Please. Help! Somebody help!

07:45.500 --> 07:49.788
Grandma. Come on,
breathe for me. Breathe.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.406
You can't sleep either?

08:25.786 --> 08:27.359
What are we gonna do now?

08:40.967 --> 08:43.256
"In the great green room

08:43.530 --> 08:45.298
There was a telephone

08:45.366 --> 08:47.033
And a red balloon

08:47.101 --> 08:51.471
And a picture of the cow
jumping over the moon."

08:55.148 --> 09:00.492
"And there were three little
bears sitting on chairs..."

09:14.889 --> 09:16.242
- Get ready!
- Ready.

09:16.267 --> 09:18.039
- Set! Go!
- Set.

09:19.174 --> 09:20.523
- Go.
- Oh, my God.

09:20.585 --> 09:22.679
- Oh, you're gonna beat...
- Get it, get it, get it!

09:22.704 --> 09:24.355
- Okay, whip 'em, whip 'em, whip 'em!
- Okay, okay.

09:24.379 --> 09:26.546
- Oh, my God!
- Come on! Get him!

09:26.571 --> 09:28.871
How fast you're going!

09:28.896 --> 09:30.946
- Hey!
- Aw.

09:39.031 --> 09:40.460
Okay. You see what I'm doing?

09:44.352 --> 09:45.867
Careful, Kev! Careful.

09:53.101 --> 09:54.664
Have you seen my vest?

09:54.672 --> 09:56.572
In the bathroom.

09:57.484 --> 09:59.108
They shut the water off.

10:01.921 --> 10:03.379
I get paid Friday.

10:04.296 --> 10:06.772
We can shower at Mrs. Johnson's
till the water's back on.

10:06.797 --> 10:08.242
It's 8:15, Ma. You got to go.

10:08.267 --> 10:09.617
I know, I know.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.085
Happy birthday.

10:11.359 --> 10:12.868
Thank you, baby.

10:13.445 --> 10:15.092
Get your stuff.
I'm taking you to school.

10:15.117 --> 10:17.428
No, you can't. Sam's gonna
be mad if you're late again.

10:17.453 --> 10:19.641
Well, let him be mad. It's my birthday,

10:19.710 --> 10:21.943
and I want to take my
baby girl to school.

10:22.546 --> 10:23.601
Okay.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.114
The electricity bill was-was right here.

10:26.150 --> 10:27.812
I put it in the mail yesterday.

10:28.226 --> 10:29.781
What would I do without you?

10:32.546 --> 10:34.803
I beat every girl in
my class in the sprints.

10:34.828 --> 10:36.125
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

10:36.695 --> 10:38.577
Mr. Troxell had me race
against the boys.

10:38.898 --> 10:40.028
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.713
Well, you might beat me, then.

10:41.992 --> 10:43.365
Mom.

10:44.671 --> 10:47.328
Stop. I'm not gonna race
you in the streets.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.546
Fine.

10:49.539 --> 10:50.851
What time are you off work?

10:51.140 --> 10:53.460
I'm picking up some
extra hours, so 7:00.

10:53.812 --> 10:55.725
7:00 like 7:00, or 7:00 like 10:00?

10:55.750 --> 10:57.420
Okay, don't be a smart-ass.

10:57.445 --> 10:59.242
7:00 like 7:00. Why?

10:59.914 --> 11:01.476
I'm making you dinner for your birthday,

11:01.500 --> 11:03.585
and don't ask me what,
'cause it's a surprise.

11:03.867 --> 11:06.281
Okay. Just make sure you don't burn it.

11:06.863 --> 11:08.696
- Like last time.
- Get off me. Get off...

11:20.445 --> 11:22.781
Manny say whaaaaat!

12:09.801 --> 12:10.889
Ouch.

12:15.738 --> 12:17.577
Hey, it's Shauna.

12:17.602 --> 12:19.210
- Leave a message.
- Mom.

12:19.344 --> 12:20.743
Mom, where are you?

12:20.768 --> 12:22.304
I hurt myself.

12:32.722 --> 12:33.843
Excuse me.

12:33.958 --> 12:36.522
Excuse me, please.
Can you... I cut my hand.

12:36.605 --> 12:37.655
Okay, okay.

12:40.085 --> 12:41.741
Let's get you all wrapped up.

12:42.003 --> 12:43.835
- How's that feel?
- Good.

12:44.287 --> 12:46.454
Now, it is gonna itch for a few weeks,

12:46.479 --> 12:48.429
but just try not to scratch it,

12:48.454 --> 12:50.218
because we want it to heal, okay?

12:59.991 --> 13:01.366
All right.

13:02.108 --> 13:03.182
Excuse me.

13:03.397 --> 13:04.649
Deja, hi.

13:04.684 --> 13:05.733
My name is Linda.

13:05.758 --> 13:07.421
I'm from Child Services.

13:07.911 --> 13:09.749
Just want to make sure you're okay.

13:13.566 --> 13:16.950
Deja, you told the nurse
your mom was at work.

13:16.975 --> 13:19.061
And we called her job
and she's not there.

13:19.086 --> 13:20.968
Do you have any idea where she could be?

13:23.389 --> 13:24.450
Excuse me.

13:24.475 --> 13:26.297
Hello. Um, I got a message
that my daughter is here.

13:26.321 --> 13:28.288
- Ma.
- Deja.

13:28.882 --> 13:30.308
Wh-Where were you?

13:30.499 --> 13:33.099
Uh, we went out for my birthday,
and my phone died.

13:33.124 --> 13:34.812
I'm so sorry, baby girl.

13:34.837 --> 13:37.165
- Shauna, can I have a word?
- Who are you?

13:37.374 --> 13:39.482
I'm Linda. We need to talk.

13:39.507 --> 13:41.063
- In private, please.
- No, no, no, no, no. Just give me...

13:41.087 --> 13:42.609
- Just step right out...
- Can I just have one second?

13:42.633 --> 13:44.133
- I just got here.
- Just go through the door.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.531
- Did you hear that my phone died?
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.555 --> 13:46.691
Then what do you want?

13:46.776 --> 13:48.004
I can sort of smell the alcohol.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.289
No, no, no. I only had one drink.

13:49.313 --> 13:50.940
- I'm Child Protective Services.
- No, no, no. You don't...

13:50.964 --> 13:52.308
no, no, no. No, that's not necessary.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.931
- That's not necessary...
- I just...

13:59.205 --> 14:01.991
Can't tell you how many times
I've slept on this thing.

14:02.379 --> 14:04.468
It's not much of a bed,
but it's comfortable.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.444
I-I'll do it, I'll do it.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.436
I've called around.

14:21.585 --> 14:23.421
I'm gonna need
pretty immediate placement.

14:25.405 --> 14:26.561
For one night.

14:26.801 --> 14:28.234
Maybe longer, I'm not sure yet.

14:40.552 --> 14:42.052
Come on. Try it.

14:42.137 --> 14:44.128
I can't. I'm not as good as you.

14:44.153 --> 14:45.378
Nobody's as good as me.

14:45.403 --> 14:47.105
Now get up. I can't have you

14:47.130 --> 14:48.667
at the school dance acting all boring.

14:52.698 --> 14:54.730
Doing good.

14:54.755 --> 14:56.277
What's with all the damn noise?

14:56.417 --> 14:57.503
You can't knock?

14:57.734 --> 14:59.963
Turn that crap off
and get your asses to school.

14:59.988 --> 15:02.433
But the buses aren't even here
yet, Foster Dad.

15:02.574 --> 15:05.706
Out. Now. Before I toss you
out that window.

15:14.012 --> 15:15.092
Well?

15:16.453 --> 15:17.834
Did you see his face?

15:19.007 --> 15:20.404
Why do you talk to him like that?

15:20.429 --> 15:21.865
That only gets him madder.

15:22.514 --> 15:23.662
You should be thanking me.

15:23.687 --> 15:25.971
Long as I talk, he focuses on me
and not you.

15:25.996 --> 15:28.404
- But you always get in trouble.
- Exactly.

15:28.429 --> 15:30.085
When he gets drunk,
he's gonna hit me, anyway.

15:30.109 --> 15:31.920
Might as well have some fun
before he does.

15:34.006 --> 15:36.115
Stop worrying about lame-ass Mr. Miller.

15:36.149 --> 15:37.295
His life sucks.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.834
He's got no job and
his wife's butt ugly.

15:41.172 --> 15:42.812
You know what you're wearing
to the dance?

15:42.966 --> 15:45.944
I got this purple dress I like,
but I don't have any makeup.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.397
We could just get our own.

15:49.259 --> 15:50.467
With what money?

15:55.084 --> 15:57.850
Raven, no. Mr. Baldwin's so old.
We can't do...

15:57.875 --> 15:59.701
That's why it'll be easy. Deja, damn.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.881
- I like you, but you're soft.
- I'm not soft.

16:02.147 --> 16:03.600
- Okay.
- I'm not.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.490
You're soft, Deja.

16:05.872 --> 16:08.022
You're quiet and you're sweet
and you're soft.

16:08.317 --> 16:09.451
Now, come on.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.858
- Hey, Mr. B.
- Hey, Mr. Baldwin.

16:12.883 --> 16:13.915
Hey, girls.

16:23.093 --> 16:25.240
Deja, come on. Take this.

16:27.733 --> 16:28.983
Stop looking at him.

16:29.459 --> 16:30.459
Here.

16:30.782 --> 16:31.889
And this.

16:32.247 --> 16:33.350
And one of these.

16:37.608 --> 16:38.808
Let's go.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.108
Bye, girls.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.662
Um, is-is this really necessary?

16:58.701 --> 17:01.118
Yes, it's necessary; it's contouring.

17:01.149 --> 17:03.186
Raven, Deja, come on down here.

17:35.578 --> 17:37.623
He's never beat you that bad before.

17:47.027 --> 17:48.381
The Millers tell me you're going

17:48.406 --> 17:50.123
to a school dance next week.

17:50.909 --> 17:52.944
- That's wonderful.
- When do I go home?

17:53.944 --> 17:54.944
Deja.

17:55.479 --> 17:58.444
Your mother's been in and out
of treatment for the past year.

17:58.469 --> 18:00.983
She only started using that
stuff 'cause she misses me.

18:01.059 --> 18:02.209
I understand.

18:03.404 --> 18:05.084
But I want to make sure

18:05.109 --> 18:06.640
the next time you go home it's for good,

18:06.664 --> 18:08.436
and that's not the case right now.

18:15.266 --> 18:16.803
Is everything okay here?

18:20.969 --> 18:22.912
You can tell me if something's wrong.

18:32.146 --> 18:33.194
Okay.

18:35.370 --> 18:38.115
I'll have a quick word with
the Millers before I head out.

18:38.462 --> 18:39.701
Enjoy the dance.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.498
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

18:44.499 --> 18:45.756
He hits us.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.186
Raven.

19:19.835 --> 19:21.186
Raven, are you awake?

19:24.350 --> 19:25.772
Raven, are you mad at me?

19:27.061 --> 19:28.147
Leave me alone.

19:29.364 --> 19:31.147
I had to say something.

19:34.463 --> 19:36.694
Do you know how many beds I've slept in?

19:37.904 --> 19:38.959
I don't.

19:39.465 --> 19:42.053
'Cause by the year
I turned nine, I lost count.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.248
At least he only hit.

19:45.182 --> 19:47.565
We could have stayed
in those beds for years.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.998
Now we'll get separated.

19:52.955 --> 19:55.131
It's like a storm once it starts, Deja.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.358
Bed after bed after bed.

19:58.187 --> 19:59.225
Before,

19:59.315 --> 20:00.850
at least we had each other,

20:01.461 --> 20:03.037
at least we weren't alone.

20:13.710 --> 20:16.037
Your mom's doing much better;
I'm optimistic.

20:29.945 --> 20:31.023
Deja.

20:36.938 --> 20:38.839
I was thinking about making dinner,

20:38.864 --> 20:40.531
maybe Grandma's jambalaya.

20:40.682 --> 20:41.695
Been a while.

20:41.901 --> 20:43.017
And I can help.

20:43.759 --> 20:45.437
What would I do without you?

20:49.577 --> 20:51.499
A friend from rehab
might join us tonight

20:51.524 --> 20:52.702
if that's all right.

20:54.509 --> 20:55.679
Uh, yeah.

21:01.617 --> 21:03.656
I'm telling you, even the abuelitas

21:03.749 --> 21:05.538
- were dancing in the street.
- Mm.

21:05.563 --> 21:08.124
It was crazy. But that's DR, you know.

21:08.874 --> 21:10.109
I don't know. Maybe...

21:10.788 --> 21:12.640
I can take you there some day.

21:13.835 --> 21:15.710
- Do you have a job?
- Deja!

21:15.937 --> 21:17.557
That's okay. She can ask.

21:18.226 --> 21:20.234
- I work for myself.
- Doing what?

21:20.976 --> 21:22.362
I run a few businesses.

21:22.431 --> 21:24.431
You know, merchandizing mostly.

21:26.507 --> 21:27.554
Look,

21:27.867 --> 21:29.570
I know this is a lot for you, Deja.

21:30.046 --> 21:32.183
You and your mom are just trying
to figure your stuff out,

21:32.207 --> 21:35.476
and here I come, fresh out of rehab.

21:36.265 --> 21:38.202
Laugh like a Disney villain, right?

21:42.187 --> 21:44.100
You know, I think I was
just a little older than you

21:44.124 --> 21:45.618
when my mom met my stepdad,

21:45.687 --> 21:48.515
and no matter what he did,
I hated the guy.

21:49.109 --> 21:50.834
But I really hope that you'll give me

21:50.859 --> 21:52.663
a chance to prove myself to you,

21:54.210 --> 21:56.202
because I really like your mom.

21:58.351 --> 22:01.531
You know, like,
I really, like, like her.

22:01.734 --> 22:04.421
Like, so much. Like, serious, you know?

22:10.726 --> 22:12.459
- Give me a break.
- Give you a break?

22:12.511 --> 22:14.428
You took my money and did what with it?

22:14.497 --> 22:16.430
I told you it sounded
like a good deal, right?

22:16.499 --> 22:18.232
That was a lot of money, Lonzo.

22:30.112 --> 22:31.456
- Then, what are you doing?
- Please.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.120
I'm trying to get you
and Dej out of here.

22:37.797 --> 22:40.531
Lonzo, please. What is this gun
doing in the house?

22:40.556 --> 22:41.891
- What are you doing in my stuff?
- Just tell me.

22:41.915 --> 22:42.930
I was trying to help you out.

22:42.954 --> 22:44.008
Didn't I tell you to
stay out of my stuff?

22:44.032 --> 22:46.032
Okay, I'm sorry, but we have a child
in this house. You know that.

22:46.056 --> 22:47.071
I know we got a child in this house.

22:47.095 --> 22:48.712
Okay, then just get rid
of it, okay? Please.

22:48.736 --> 22:50.523
Shauna, why don't you just
admit it, right?

22:50.549 --> 22:51.683
You're better off without me.

22:51.707 --> 22:53.117
No, that's not...

23:08.867 --> 23:10.445
Where are my car keys?

23:11.158 --> 23:12.640
I can't be late for work.

23:13.465 --> 23:14.679
Pass them chips, dude.

23:17.532 --> 23:20.710
Did you at least
fill up the tank? Lonzo?

23:20.735 --> 23:22.796
Hey, Ma, I'm gonna be home late.

23:23.187 --> 23:24.374
Why? What's going on?

23:24.419 --> 23:27.523
Nothing. I just...
I got this thing after school.

23:27.601 --> 23:28.609
Oh, okay.

23:28.634 --> 23:30.320
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, have a good day.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.140
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

23:53.551 --> 23:55.281
Hey, you got
that math test today, right?

23:55.754 --> 23:56.906
Yup.

24:00.166 --> 24:01.335
Let me help.

24:25.242 --> 24:26.507
All right, girls?

24:27.382 --> 24:28.484
Girls?

24:28.876 --> 24:30.275
Girls, come on!

24:30.710 --> 24:32.609
Let's get started.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.976
Hey, uh-uh. Kesha, zip it.

24:37.132 --> 24:40.096
Listen, we have the fall
dance slam in a week.

24:40.148 --> 24:43.585
I need y'all to just show out
on these solos.

24:43.846 --> 24:45.359
Come on. Deja, you're up.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.398
Can I help you, Officers?

25:17.132 --> 25:18.623
Why'd I get taken out of school?

25:18.648 --> 25:20.671
I'm missing drill team. What's going on?

25:22.148 --> 25:23.482
Your mom's been arrested.

25:23.507 --> 25:24.874
She's in custody.

25:25.429 --> 25:27.795
All I know so far is
she was pulled over,

25:27.820 --> 25:29.835
and the police found a gun in her car.

25:34.171 --> 25:35.406
Well, it's not hers.

25:35.718 --> 25:38.429
Well, they are gonna try to get
to the bottom of this as quickly

25:38.454 --> 25:39.758
as they can, and in the meantime...

25:39.782 --> 25:41.085
Where am I going?

25:45.115 --> 25:46.374
Hi there. Come in.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.281
- Hi, guys. This is Deja.
- Hi.

25:51.937 --> 25:52.968
Hi, Deja.

25:53.554 --> 25:55.038
It's really nice to meet you.

25:56.007 --> 25:57.023
I'm Randall.

25:57.828 --> 25:58.828
I'm Beth.

25:59.335 --> 26:00.929
So happy to have you here.

26:01.648 --> 26:03.698
This is Tess and Annie.

26:08.226 --> 26:10.788
You can sleep in the reading
chair if you're scared.

26:22.890 --> 26:25.984
You're a good person, I think, Deja...

26:27.742 --> 26:29.391
but you need to listen to me.

26:30.335 --> 26:31.793
The next time you find a bed

26:31.862 --> 26:33.828
that feels even a little safe,

26:35.092 --> 26:36.335
don't blow it.

27:14.546 --> 27:17.101
"I had fun, too, Foster Dad."

27:19.273 --> 27:21.335
I'm going to talk to my daughter!

27:21.398 --> 27:22.499
- I just...
- Mom?

27:22.749 --> 27:23.898
Dayje.

27:24.807 --> 27:25.952
Hey, Tater Tot.

27:35.140 --> 27:38.499
You remember what I told you
about working hard. All right?

27:39.421 --> 27:40.812
Big house, fancy car?

27:40.937 --> 27:42.851
Big house.

27:43.390 --> 27:44.773
Fancy car.

27:59.171 --> 28:00.367
Bye, Randall.

28:02.077 --> 28:03.327
Bye, Dej.

28:19.648 --> 28:22.484
- Is Lonzo...?
- He's gone. It's just us.

28:25.378 --> 28:27.327
I'm gonna get it right this time, Deja.

28:42.976 --> 28:44.218
Look what I made.

28:44.243 --> 28:46.429
- What's that?
- I made it at school.

28:46.507 --> 28:47.856
It's kind of like a home bank.

28:47.933 --> 28:49.333
We can use it to save money.

28:51.558 --> 28:52.843
Go on, say it.

28:53.397 --> 28:54.999
"What would you do without me?"

28:56.921 --> 28:58.085
Okay.

29:35.980 --> 29:37.687
My mom doesn't know I'm here.

29:39.205 --> 29:42.234
We're past due on our gas.

29:43.617 --> 29:45.726
We haven't had heat
in a couple of weeks.

29:47.624 --> 29:49.374
I didn't know where else to go.

30:05.187 --> 30:06.499
I paid you on the first.

30:06.524 --> 30:07.790
With a bounced check.

30:07.831 --> 30:09.429
That is your third bounced check.

30:09.454 --> 30:10.523
Hey, lower your voice.

30:10.548 --> 30:12.601
I should have kicked you
out of here months ago.

30:12.626 --> 30:14.771
- I told you I'm good for it.
- You're good for nothing.

30:14.795 --> 30:17.476
You pay your rent by the end
of the day, or you're gone.

30:20.910 --> 30:22.257
We're getting evicted?

30:23.171 --> 30:24.538
Nobody's getting evicted.

30:24.563 --> 30:26.435
- But Terry just said...
- Don't worry about it.

30:26.459 --> 30:27.820
I said I'll figure it out.

30:39.648 --> 30:41.445
The box is empty, Mom. What happened?

30:43.140 --> 30:44.601
We have bills, Deja.

30:44.714 --> 30:47.348
Damn. I'm picking up
extra shifts, but we have bills.

30:47.892 --> 30:49.624
And I had to help with Lonzo's bail.

30:49.702 --> 30:51.163
- What?!
- Look, he's locked up,

30:51.188 --> 30:52.813
and it's my fault.
I can't just turn my back.

30:52.837 --> 30:54.421
- What is wrong with you?!
- Excuse me?!

30:54.446 --> 30:56.249
It's always gonna be
something, isn't it?

30:56.274 --> 30:57.781
Okay, you need to watch your tone.

31:03.968 --> 31:05.117
Look, I'll figure this out.

31:05.548 --> 31:06.999
You don't have to worry.

31:10.695 --> 31:11.804
Deja?

31:11.891 --> 31:14.077
Come back here! Deja!

31:14.293 --> 31:15.406
Deja...

31:32.820 --> 31:34.234
You've reached Randall Pearson

31:34.259 --> 31:36.560
of R & B Properties.
Please leave a message,

31:36.585 --> 31:38.485
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

31:58.718 --> 32:00.187
Uh, what can I get for this?

32:01.234 --> 32:02.882
Look, we're not Goodwill.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.793
We don't take this kind of stuff here.

32:05.042 --> 32:06.171
Sorry.

32:45.538 --> 32:46.567
Hello?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.224
Deja. It's Randall.

32:48.249 --> 32:49.359
I saw you called.

32:50.742 --> 32:52.702
Uh, yeah. Um...

32:53.585 --> 32:55.935
that Bill Nye guy was just on TV.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.019
I just thought of you.

32:57.796 --> 32:59.452
Oh. Okay.

33:00.827 --> 33:02.906
Well, uh, we're in Las Vegas,

33:03.531 --> 33:05.891
but I'm keeping my phone on me, okay?

33:05.916 --> 33:07.109
If you need anything.

33:07.624 --> 33:08.851
Okay.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.077
So your heat's back on? It's all good?

33:14.132 --> 33:16.024
Yeah. Um, I'm sorry.

33:16.049 --> 33:18.156
It's hard to call when my mom's around.

34:55.539 --> 34:58.286
Hey, uhm, let me get you
something to drink.

35:00.053 --> 35:01.454
- You're back!
- Deja!

35:03.396 --> 35:04.631
Girls,

35:04.803 --> 35:06.486
you remember Deja's mom, Shauna?

35:06.544 --> 35:07.615
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.154
- Hey.
- There you go.

35:09.287 --> 35:11.497
Why don't you guys take these
into the other room, huh?

35:16.396 --> 35:17.935
This is just temporary.

35:18.161 --> 35:20.400
Yeah. I mean, we'll sort it all out.

35:20.436 --> 35:22.185
You stay here tonight, get a good meal.

35:22.210 --> 35:24.161
But we don't have
to decide anything now.

35:24.306 --> 35:26.216
I'm sure you want to wash up, settle in.

35:26.286 --> 35:28.325
Yeah, bathroom's upstairs.
You'll find it.

35:28.410 --> 35:30.310
There's, uh, fresh towels on the rack.

35:31.604 --> 35:32.724
Thank you.

35:56.185 --> 35:57.804
- I don't like it. But I like red.
- Oh!

35:59.055 --> 36:01.793
I don't know... I don't
know if she meant it

36:01.818 --> 36:04.904
- in a nice kind of way...
- Oh, oh, oh. Oh, I see.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.605
I would like

36:07.630 --> 36:09.450
to introduce to all of you,

36:10.138 --> 36:12.693
my instructor, the man who taught me

36:12.950 --> 36:14.200
how to fight.

36:14.365 --> 36:16.023
Please welcome...

36:16.091 --> 36:17.450
if you will...

36:17.748 --> 36:19.654
Sergeant John Hurney.

36:31.334 --> 36:33.368
Sorry it's the couch for tonight.

36:33.437 --> 36:35.310
The basement's
a bit of a mess right now.

36:35.335 --> 36:37.575
- Oh, this is fine for us. Thank you.
- Okay.

36:38.591 --> 36:41.021
Um, can I sleep in my old room?

36:42.333 --> 36:43.622
If that's okay.

36:44.138 --> 36:45.263
Of course.

36:45.990 --> 36:47.146
Okay.

36:48.130 --> 36:49.309
Good night, Deja.

36:50.964 --> 36:52.193
Good night.

37:04.865 --> 37:06.021
You ran track?

37:07.638 --> 37:09.285
Yeah. In high school.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.639
I was anchor in the four-by-four. You?

37:11.849 --> 37:14.396
No. I just did cheerleading.

37:14.810 --> 37:15.879
I hated it.

37:15.904 --> 37:17.912
I only did it to impress this guy

37:17.981 --> 37:19.943
on the basketball team, Richard Gavin.

37:20.622 --> 37:22.337
He looked like D'Angelo.

37:22.362 --> 37:23.378
Say no more.

37:23.403 --> 37:24.872
Mm-hmm.

37:26.193 --> 37:28.529
I never seen her acting like that,

37:28.849 --> 37:31.224
- like she was tonight.
- Like what?

37:32.222 --> 37:33.450
Like a kid.

37:36.419 --> 37:38.646
I was a teenager when I had Deja.

37:40.338 --> 37:42.122
I don't mean that as an excuse.

37:43.041 --> 37:45.130
Well, maybe I do. I don't, I don't know.

37:46.763 --> 37:48.458
She's special though, isn't she?

37:50.505 --> 37:51.931
I know all mothers think that,

37:51.956 --> 37:54.707
but I-I think she's really
special-special, you know?

37:55.151 --> 37:56.404
She is.

38:03.060 --> 38:04.388
I failed Deja.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.222
No. You didn't.

38:06.247 --> 38:10.683
No, I failed her,
and I can't keep failing her.

38:13.364 --> 38:14.880
You know what I always say to her?

38:14.905 --> 38:17.490
I say, "What would I do without you?"

38:20.034 --> 38:22.052
I've been saying that to her
since she was five.

38:26.135 --> 38:27.599
Who puts that on a kid?

38:29.264 --> 38:30.419
Who does that?

38:39.622 --> 38:40.700
May I?

38:42.849 --> 38:44.294
You kept them alive.

38:45.060 --> 38:46.367
It's no biggie.

38:46.453 --> 38:50.121
Just made sure they got
enough light, enough Beyoncé,

38:50.156 --> 38:51.333
enough water.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.490
This one's looking a little droopy.

38:53.515 --> 38:55.660
Oh, you didn't know?
That's a new species.

38:55.728 --> 38:59.083
It's a Hibiscus droopus.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.032
It's very rare.

39:01.100 --> 39:03.474
Oh, my God, you're still so corny.

39:03.499 --> 39:05.703
Like I'm on the cob, baby.

39:05.772 --> 39:07.521
Oh, God.

39:12.740 --> 39:15.396
- You okay?
- Yeah.

39:19.384 --> 39:21.669
I know it's kind of a weird night.

39:33.890 --> 39:35.107
What you thinking?

39:37.919 --> 39:42.004
Thinking about how many beds
I've slept in already,

39:42.029 --> 39:43.374
in my whole life.

39:44.802 --> 39:47.896
S-Scary thing to think about,
'cause the number's pretty high.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.409
You remember, a while ago,

39:53.700 --> 39:55.520
you told me I reminded you of you?

39:56.450 --> 39:57.583
I do.

39:59.255 --> 40:02.583
That was kind of weird to me, honestly,

40:03.818 --> 40:06.075
'cause you seemed so different from me.

40:06.474 --> 40:08.091
Psst.

40:08.349 --> 40:11.388
It just didn't seem
very déjà-vu'y to me.

40:16.091 --> 40:17.716
But then I started thinking,

40:19.090 --> 40:23.109
isn't it weird how everyone
goes to sleep at night?

40:24.497 --> 40:25.504
Like,

40:25.529 --> 40:28.004
everyone in the whole planet.

40:28.568 --> 40:29.956
All these people.

40:30.474 --> 40:32.177
People I'll never know.

40:34.044 --> 40:35.255
Some are poor.

40:36.490 --> 40:37.964
Some are rich.

40:38.049 --> 40:39.582
Some sleep in beds.

40:40.068 --> 40:41.716
Some sleep on the floor.

40:42.950 --> 40:44.357
But, at the end of the day,

40:44.982 --> 40:46.841
everyone sleeps.

40:49.513 --> 40:52.427
And I guess, if you think about it hard,

40:53.318 --> 40:57.388
you know, got other stuff
everyone's got, too.

40:58.872 --> 41:00.365
Things that hurt them.

41:03.024 --> 41:06.122
Things that make them feel better.

41:09.115 --> 41:12.372
Anyway, I don't know
if that's déjà vu, but, um,

41:13.531 --> 41:15.544
that's just what I was thinking about.

41:23.816 --> 41:25.568
I'm really tired.

41:36.482 --> 41:37.693
I know, sweetheart.

41:58.669 --> 42:00.029
I got to go.

42:01.982 --> 42:03.490
And I can't take her with me.
