WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:02.327
Previously on SEAL TEAM...

00:02.370 --> 00:05.123
You ever, uh, heard from Danny?
Danny Cooper?

00:05.170 --> 00:06.637
Yeah, you guys were pretty tight
back in the day.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.467
Yeah, no, we were for a while.
Yeah?

00:08.500 --> 00:10.309
Ti|| he went and
tried to kiss me.
Ooh.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.501
I'm not the same guy
I was on Team Four.
Is this the part

00:12.540 --> 00:14.337
where I'm supposed to
melt because you've
seen inside my soul?

00:14.380 --> 00:15.506
Melting comes later.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.643
JASON:
I should come home.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.669
Look, our family

00:17.710 --> 00:20.213
is in extremis
at the moment.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.413
Do you really think we ought to
be making big life decisions?

00:26.220 --> 00:28.654
I'm so sorry.

00:28.690 --> 00:29.486
We know.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.588
Okay?

00:37.870 --> 00:39.838
Over requested position.

00:39.870 --> 00:43.237
Holding in a figure eight
at 3,000 meters.

00:43.270 --> 00:45.465
Latency is 1.8 seconds.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.478
Tightening up on target.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.670
RITA:
Copy.

00:48.710 --> 00:51.304
Got fuel for six hours.

00:51.350 --> 00:54.274
Autopilot initiated.

00:55.220 --> 00:57.142
What the hell?

00:57.190 --> 01:00.216
She's losing altitude, fast.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.682
Did we take a hit?

01:01.720 --> 01:03.426
No warnings of
incoming fire

01:03.460 --> 01:05.257
_ or air traffic. _
Stick's not responding.

01:05.290 --> 01:06.791
I've lost__
maneuverability.

01:06.830 --> 01:07.854
2,000 meters. What
the hell's going on?

01:07.900 --> 01:09.322
Come on.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.394
1,000 meters. Rita.

01:10.430 --> 01:11.419
No, I've lost her.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.165
E39 going down.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.394
I say again,

01:14.440 --> 01:16.533
the E39
is going down.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.812
Ah, look at this kid, he's like
a human garbage disposal.

01:28.850 --> 01:30.579
He's crushing it.
Hey, I told you,

01:30.620 --> 01:31.882
we're trying to cut down
on sugar in the morning.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.512
Mikey.
Come on.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.289
He needs the fuel, right?

01:35.320 --> 01:36.856
He's growing.
Look at the muscles.

01:36.890 --> 01:38.881
Like, Mikey Muscles,
show her the Mikey Muscles.

01:38.930 --> 01:39.851
Yeah.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.697
Huh?

01:41.730 --> 01:43.789
I'm really the only one
who finds this creepy?

01:43.830 --> 01:45.798
Dad comes over
to take us grocery shopping?

01:45.830 --> 01:47.798
Hey, we're not
just grocery shopping.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.263
We're grocery shopping
Jason-style.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.175
That's big.
Emma, you're gonna
need to get a job

01:52.210 --> 01:54.371
if you want to start buying
your own groceries, okay?

01:54.410 --> 01:56.844
Seriously? Is this something
you saw on The Brady Bunch?

01:56.880 --> 01:58.905
Couple that shops together
stays together?

01:58.950 --> 02:00.508
You know, I'm sorry,
but it sounds like she's trying

02:00.550 --> 02:01.539
to pick a fight
with us, right?

02:01.580 --> 02:03.719
Yeah, I guess jail time
really toughened her up.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.286
Whatever.
You guys want to go on

02:05.320 --> 02:06.685
with your little
Norman Rockwell cosplay...

02:06.720 --> 02:07.550
JASON: I'll show you
Norman Rockwell.

02:07.590 --> 02:09.251
You want to see
Norman Rockwell? Aah!

02:09.290 --> 02:10.382
That look like Norman
Rockwell to you?

02:10.430 --> 02:12.159
EMMA:
Just saying.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.428
I don't see why you need
to drag me and Mikey around

02:13.460 --> 02:14.757
like we're three-year-olds.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.949
Or is that part of the kink?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.525
Well, it's not like we can
trust you to stay home alone.

02:18.570 --> 02:19.764
JASON:
Mm.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.290
I said I was sorry.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.432
Yeah, it's gonna take
a lot more than that.

02:22.470 --> 02:25.303
Boom. Lot more.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.807
We have a right to know
if you're getting back together.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.535
Wow.
You have a right?

02:28.580 --> 02:30.241
Does this mean Dad's getting out
of the Naw?

02:32.920 --> 02:35.639
Why would you say
something like that?

02:35.680 --> 02:37.443
Well, Mom said you guys
couldn't even consider

02:37.490 --> 02:39.185
getting back together
till you were out.

02:40.490 --> 02:43.459
Okay. You know what?

02:43.490 --> 02:44.650
You guys are gonna be late
for school.

02:44.690 --> 02:45.725
Get your school stuff,
get in the car.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.419
Keep crushing the cereal,
Big Mikey Mike. Mikey Muscles.

02:50.470 --> 02:52.267
: Why would you say
something like that?

02:52.300 --> 02:53.631
Is that how you feel?
You want me to leave the teams?

02:53.670 --> 02:55.695
Okay, I said it once,
months ago.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.298
I was upset. I'm sorry.

02:57.340 --> 02:58.602
That what you want?

02:58.640 --> 03:00.733
EMMA:
Come on, Dad!

03:00.780 --> 03:01.929
We're gonna be late.
Hey, I...

03:01.980 --> 03:03.504
You know what?
This is really not the time

03:03.550 --> 03:04.574
to have the conversation.

03:04.610 --> 03:05.804
I know.
EMMA:
Dad.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.215
I'll drop them off,
I'll come back,

03:07.250 --> 03:08.217
and we'll have
the conversation.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.548
Jason, I got to show
three houses this morning.

03:10.590 --> 03:11.909
I'm not even gonna have time
to unload these groceries.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.019
Of course you do.
Can we—- Jason, can we please

03:13.060 --> 03:14.709
just talk about it later?
Yeah, let's do that later.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.852
Of course.

03:15.890 --> 03:17.323
Later it is.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.668
DANNY:
Good morning.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.998
Hey.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.769
You're just gonna ghost me?

03:31.810 --> 03:32.970
I don't think that you can
call it "ghosting"

03:33.010 --> 03:34.375
if you stay at my place, but...

03:34.410 --> 03:36.844
No, I'm just gonna

03:36.880 --> 03:38.700
go run off these sins
from last night.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.672
Thank you,

03:40.720 --> 03:42.881
by the way. You didn't have to
pay for everything.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.683
Oh, come on. You finally agree
to go out with me,

03:44.720 --> 03:46.517
I'm not gonna pay? No chance.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.812
Besides, it's about time
a SEAL starts

03:48.860 --> 03:50.623
taking care of you
for a change.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.628
I told you,
I don't date frogmen.

03:52.660 --> 03:54.696
Well, lucky for you,
the Talimonster saw fit

03:54.730 --> 03:56.960
to blow me up,
and end my career.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.928
Look, I'm sorr-- I'm not, um...

04:02.970 --> 04:03.709
Used to waking up next to this?

04:05.470 --> 04:06.630
I was gonna say
I'm not a morning person,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.875
but now that you mention it.

04:11.980 --> 04:14.039
DANNY:
Hey. Here.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.514
Oh.

04:16.550 --> 04:21.749
How about you and I go get some
breakfast after your run?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.990
I got a new shipment
of bailout bottles

04:27.030 --> 04:29.794
coming in at work
that needs inventory.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.367
Yeah. Yeah. I got to get
on the horn with the West Coast,

04:37.410 --> 04:39.332
talk some clients off the ledge,
so I'll get out of your hair.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.302
Okay, I'm gonna take that run.

04:41.340 --> 04:42.500
Sure.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.744
I had fun last night.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.817
It was fun.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.612
Maybe we can do it again,
later in the week?

04:54.660 --> 04:56.582
Maybe.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.664
STELLA:
Hey, sleepyhead. Coffee.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.339
You're wearing my
favorite shirt.

05:10.370 --> 05:11.906
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:11.940 --> 05:14.431
Did you forget that my closet's
40 miles away?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.948
No, I was gon-- I was gonna wear
that shirt today.

05:16.980 --> 05:19.869
Well, I guess you're gonna have
to come grab it from me, then.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.114
Don't tempt me with a good time.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.941
Hey, I, uh, I got to go.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.514
Aw.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.084
Are you getting spun up again?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.985
Look at you
with the vernacular, huh?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.520
Nice. Avoidance.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.891
That means that's a yes.

05:32.930 --> 05:34.124
Here.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.491
Where are you gonna go?

05:35.530 --> 05:37.623
I don't know yet.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.662
Okay. Well, I wish I hadn't
graded all these papers.

05:40.700 --> 05:43.567
Why not? Now you can hang out
and just relax all day.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.498
Thank you. Yeah.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.974
Grading is, uh, pretty much
the only way I can clear my mind

05:48.010 --> 05:49.568
when you're off
saving the world.

05:51.010 --> 05:52.819
Hey. I-I'll be
back soon, okay?

05:52.850 --> 05:54.010
Okay.

05:54.050 --> 05:57.087
And when I am,
I'm gonna want the shirt back.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.653
It's my favorite shirt.

05:59.690 --> 06:01.453
And I want it.
Sorry.

06:01.490 --> 06:03.151
But then you'll be gone again
soon, right?

06:03.190 --> 06:05.078
On, um, deployment.

06:05.130 --> 06:09.055
How's that for
vernacular?

06:09.100 --> 06:11.728
Trish mentioned it
the other night.

06:14.570 --> 06:16.538
I'm sorry.

06:16.570 --> 06:19.038
Look, I-I've been meaning
to talk to you about it.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.901
I just didn't know
how to bring it up.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.579
I've known about it for a week

06:23.610 --> 06:25.009
and didn't know
how to bring it up.

06:25.050 --> 06:27.075
Didn't actually
want to bring it up.

06:28.850 --> 06:31.580
So, uh, where-where are
they sending you guys?

06:31.620 --> 06:34.487
Uh...

06:34.520 --> 06:36.488
Never really know
till you get off the plane,

06:36.530 --> 06:39.590
but as of now, Afghanistan.

06:39.630 --> 06:41.791
Oh, good.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.025
Least it's not a place that's
been convulsed by violence

06:44.070 --> 06:45.423
the last two millennia.

06:47.470 --> 06:50.633
Um, for how long?

06:50.670 --> 06:52.069
Three months, at least.

06:52.110 --> 06:54.908
That's longer
than we've been together.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.500
Yeah.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.987
I, uh... I guess
it'd be a lot to ask you

07:03.020 --> 07:05.147
to put your life on hold
and wait for me.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.650
And I guess it would
be a lot to ask you

07:09.690 --> 07:12.659
to think about me when
you're in a war zone 24/7?

07:18.900 --> 07:21.494
I guess we just got a
relationship stay of execution.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.533
So, you're sure you're not
pressing the red,

07:25.570 --> 07:26.730
coming back too soon?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.600
Last week you were
on the P.T. table.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.244
What, this week,
you're ready to roll?

07:30.280 --> 07:31.542
Look, brother,
the shoulder's great.
Yeah?

07:31.580 --> 07:33.047
Right? And you wouldn't
touch the smoke

07:33.080 --> 07:34.547
I'd be throwing today.
Yeah, I doubt that.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.719
Sure that this whole
early recovery

07:36.750 --> 07:39.241
has nothing to do
with the deployment money?

07:39.290 --> 07:40.882
: Look, man,
I appreciate the concern,

07:40.920 --> 07:42.182
but the shoulder's
squared away,

07:42.220 --> 07:44.029
and Naima has the
other stuff handled.
Okay.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.687
That good enough
for you?
Yeah.

07:45.730 --> 07:48.028
Yeah?

07:48.060 --> 07:49.869
Ah, look who it is, huh?

07:49.900 --> 07:51.697
TRENT:
Look who's back.

07:51.730 --> 07:52.833
Have a seat.

07:52.870 --> 07:53.894
I hate the number two.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.090
You_mis_s me?
Back In hIS chair.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.165
I'm just more
of an odd-number type of guy.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.132
Welcome back, bud.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.648
Yeah, brother.
ERIC:
All right, listen up.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.547
Air Force had a fancy new drone
go down

08:05.580 --> 08:07.810
about four hours ago
in the Anbar Province,

08:07.850 --> 08:09.681
just east of the
Syrian border.
Oh.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.109
Okay, any chance you're just
keeping us informed here?

08:12.150 --> 08:13.856
We are gonna
go get it back.
Bringing it back.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.710
Hope we do.
MANDY:
Iranian and Russian military

08:15.760 --> 08:17.682
all over that border.
The Air Force doesn't want

08:17.730 --> 08:19.698
the drone's proprietary
technology falling

08:19.730 --> 08:21.197
into the wrong hands.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.198
So, the Air Force loses a drone
in Iraq--

08:23.230 --> 08:24.993
where they already have
thousands of troops.

08:25.030 --> 08:27.191
Instead of using
any of them,

08:27.240 --> 08:30.767
they want to send us all the way
from beautiful Virginia Beach?

08:30.810 --> 08:32.903
Is that right?

08:32.940 --> 08:35.977
The crash site is just outside
of Al-Qa'im.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.170
Ah, that's why
they're sending us.

08:37.210 --> 08:39.849
Al-Qa'im is ISIS's
last stronghold in Iraq.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.814
Which makes it one of the most
dangerous places In the world.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.613
SONNY: Well, let's just
drop a warhead on that

08:43.650 --> 08:45.117
proprietary crap, blow it
into a million pieces,

08:45.150 --> 08:46.651
and keep us out
of the death zone.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.089
MANDY:
You know, I wish we could,

08:48.120 --> 08:49.758
but that option is
off the table.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.155
This is Meera Nelson

08:51.190 --> 08:52.999
from Defense Information
Systems Agency.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.850
She's here to
explain why.
Morning.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.720
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.261
Morning.
What I'm about
to share with you is known

08:59.300 --> 09:02.064
by, uh, only a handful of people
within our government.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.829
Moon landing was faked.
Ha, ha.

09:03.870 --> 09:05.929
I knew it.
A few months ago,

09:05.970 --> 09:08.609
DARPA detected
a mysterious Virus

09:08.640 --> 09:11.905
on one of its new
E39 drone's central processors.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.770
And subsequent tests
found indications

09:13.820 --> 09:16.789
of the same malware
on more of our drones.

09:16.820 --> 09:19.755
How many more?

09:19.790 --> 09:21.109
All of them.

09:22.690 --> 09:25.181
At first,

09:25.230 --> 09:28.199
the malware was only detected
logging keystrokes.

09:28.230 --> 09:30.118
Seemed benign.
Okay, so now you think

09:30.170 --> 09:32.832
that someone used the malware
to hijack the drone?

09:32.870 --> 09:35.691
It's the most
likely scenario.
Oh.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.038
I know, it probably seems
like you're cleaning up

09:38.070 --> 09:41.039
someone's science project,
but trust me,

09:41.080 --> 09:43.708
this drone crisis presents
an urgent threat

09:43.750 --> 09:45.604
to our national security.

09:45.650 --> 09:49.211
The E39... is patient zero.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.946
Only by recovering its processor
can we determine

09:51.990 --> 09:54.015
the exact nature of the virus,

09:54.060 --> 09:55.254
figure out a way
to reverse engineer it.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.780
ERIC:
Alpha and Bravo Teams

09:56.830 --> 09:58.354
will escort Ms. Nelson

09:58.390 --> 10:01.359
and her technician,
Mr. Nolan, to the E39,

10:01.400 --> 10:03.265
then secure the location

10:03.300 --> 10:05.393
so that they can extract
the drone's processor.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.797
All right, so the drone
went down outside of town.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.808
We slip in,
we slip out, right?

10:10.840 --> 10:13.035
Sounds simple.
It's not going
to be that simple.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.298
There it is.
We believe an 1.5. cadre

10:15.340 --> 10:20.141
found the E39 and moved it
to this former school.

10:20.180 --> 10:23.911
DAVIS:
Oh, smack dab in the middle

10:23.950 --> 10:24.985
of the city. Nice.

10:25.020 --> 10:25.884
Precisely where the final

10:25.920 --> 10:28.980
push to clear ISIS
is about to take place.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.351
You sure you're ready
to come back now?

10:30.390 --> 10:32.699
More so.
Okay.

10:32.730 --> 10:34.698
Well, there is
one more wrinkle.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.049
There's always a wrinkle.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.692
Due to the fear of
losing additional assets,

10:37.730 --> 10:39.732
the Air Force
has grounded all drones.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.965
So now we're walking into
the most dangerous place

10:42.000 --> 10:44.400
in the world... blind.

11:19.110 --> 11:22.876
Yo.

11:22.910 --> 11:23.979
Yeah?

11:24.380 --> 11:27.838
Hey, I, uh... need some advice.

11:27.880 --> 11:28.972
Point the muzzle end of your gun

11:29.020 --> 11:30.248
in the direction
you want to shoot.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.427
So?

11:37.460 --> 11:40.327
What's going on?

11:48.240 --> 11:51.164
So... we're, uh,

11:51.210 --> 11:52.939
you know, we're getting ready
for deployment here soon.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.835
Here it comes.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.474
Whole deployment talk.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.149
Yeah, huh?

12:01.180 --> 12:04.149
You and the, uh, professor
getting a little serious there?

12:06.290 --> 12:08.758
I don't know, man,
m-maybe, maybe not.

12:08.790 --> 12:11.384
Kind of at a crossroads?

12:11.430 --> 12:13.921
You know, look,
man, I, uh,

12:13.960 --> 12:17.191
I was married
well before BUD/S.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.219
So, you know,

12:18.270 --> 12:21.091
the whole long-distance
relationship conversation,

12:21.140 --> 12:24.234
I don't even know if I'm
the one to have that talk.

12:24.270 --> 12:25.464
Okay, got it.
Yeah?

12:25.510 --> 12:29.276
I'll get it
squared away.
But...

12:29.310 --> 12:31.073
I get it.

12:31.110 --> 12:32.304
I understand.

12:32.350 --> 12:34.477
There is a-a price
to pay for everyone.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.112
You know that.

12:36.150 --> 12:38.380
You just got to figure out
what you're willing to pay.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.457
I mean, can you imagine
your life without her?

12:41.490 --> 12:44.926
'Cause if you can, you got
to cut your girl loose.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.019
You're right.
Yeah.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.897
So, get some rest,
will you.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.831
Iraqi security forces

12:57.870 --> 12:59.838
have retaken almost
half of Al-Qa'im

12:59.880 --> 13:01.370
over the last
eight weeks,

13:01.410 --> 13:03.571
but the pace has been slow,
and the fighting brutal.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.498
Just as we saw in Fallujah,
these I.S. fighters

13:05.550 --> 13:07.472
have had months to
fortify their positions.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.919
How many fighters
are we looking at?

13:08.950 --> 13:10.212
Iraqi Special Forces

13:10.250 --> 13:13.048
allowed some 300 to
surrender two days ago.

13:13.090 --> 13:15.012
But we estimate there
remains about 1,200.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.459
1,200 true believers.

13:16.490 --> 13:17.559
They definitely aren't
waving the white flag.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.023
That's for sure.

13:19.060 --> 13:20.891
Fighting to the death,
maybe we will get that

13:22.930 --> 13:25.023
ERIC: The Iraqis' final siege
consists of two phases.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.937
Phase One, currently undenNay,
involves softening up

13:27.970 --> 13:30.507
I.S. defenses
with a combination

13:30.540 --> 13:32.167
of artillery shelling
and air strikes.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.132
Bomb 'em back
to the Stone Age.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.501
Or as they like to say
over there, last Tuesday.

13:36.540 --> 13:39.976
ERIC:
Phase One ends at 0500,

13:40.020 --> 13:42.079
at which point the
Iraqis will conduct

13:42.120 --> 13:44.247
_ a mechanized
infantry assault.

13:44.290 --> 13:45.348
That's urban ﬁghting,
building-to-building,

13:45.390 --> 13:46.414
bloody and brutal.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.452
No, we'll be gone before
the fighting even starts.

13:48.490 --> 13:50.128
With the artillery
and the air strikes,

13:50.160 --> 13:52.458
it'll just drive 1.5. into their
ratholes and their bunkers.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.219
It'll give us cover
to get in and out

13:54.260 --> 13:55.397
without being detected.

13:55.430 --> 13:57.466
DAVIS: We're coordinating
with the Iraqis to make sure

13:57.500 --> 13:59.127
they don't drop any artillery
near your position.

13:59.170 --> 14:00.262
RAY:
Yeah, that's real comforting.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.858
Iraqi military
and shooting straight

14:01.900 --> 14:03.128
don't always go hand in hand.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.161
Time we land, you'll have
less than two hours

14:05.210 --> 14:06.268
before Phase One ends.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.977
Look, what's the fastest infil?

14:12.010 --> 14:14.069
SONNY: Parachuting in with
all that artillery in the air

14:14.120 --> 14:16.042
doesn't exactly
tickle these nuts.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.480
And the roads are basically
one big IED by now.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.056
So that's out.
JASON:
I'll tell you what,

14:20.090 --> 14:21.978
why don't we helo in on this
riverbank right here.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.226
It's a half a klick
from our target.

14:23.260 --> 14:24.352
We can hike the
rest of the way.

14:24.390 --> 14:25.527
When we get to town,

14:25.560 --> 14:27.391
Spenser and I will
break away from the team

14:27.430 --> 14:29.625
and provide overwatch
from this...

14:29.660 --> 14:31.218
building right
across from the square.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.521
We'll clear the school,
and then

14:32.570 --> 14:34.367
we'll get Meera and Nolan here
to do their thing.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.436
How long for you
guys on target?

14:36.470 --> 14:40.179
Depends on how damaged
the drone is.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.404
You need to be fast.

14:43.510 --> 14:45.546
Let me remind you that
none of you are read-in

14:45.580 --> 14:47.912
on the technology
aboard this drone.

14:47.950 --> 14:48.917
Our eyes only.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.178
Oh, wow.

14:50.220 --> 14:53.656
Your job is to get us in
and get us out.

14:53.690 --> 14:55.385
No more.

14:55.420 --> 14:58.548
Let me remind you,
Miss Personality,

14:58.590 --> 15:02.094
that we are plopping our asses
down into the end of days battle

15:02.130 --> 15:04.121
to help you
find your little toy.

15:10.270 --> 15:11.999
JASON :
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.439
We're passing Jade.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.471
How copy?
ERIC: Bravo 1, this is TOC.

15:15.510 --> 15:17.546
Good copy.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.969
All right, that's Jade.
Almost to the school.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.476
Any activity in town?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.545
We're not picking up
any chatter.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.615
Artillery bombardment's keeping
the enemy pinned down.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.618
For 42 more minutes.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.184
All right.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.983
(explosions,
artillery fire in distance)

15:39.070 --> 15:40.958
Hard to imagine someone's about
to fight over this.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.003
Yeah, this place
is a ghost town.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.634
Ghosts don't wear S-Vests.
SONNY: Speaking of ghosts,

15:46.670 --> 15:49.275
I had experience with the
paranormal when I was a kid.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.505
A summer spent with
my grand-ninny.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.676
Excuse me. Your what?

15:52.710 --> 15:54.143
My ninny.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.216
My grand...

15:56.250 --> 15:57.217
Incoming!

16:11.570 --> 16:14.130
Welcome to Al-Qa'im.

16:14.170 --> 16:16.035
Commander Blackburn.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.628
Sir.

16:17.670 --> 16:19.763
General Parsons, Commander of
Air Combat Command.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.074
I understand you're
overseeing the operation

16:22.110 --> 16:23.247
to recover my bird.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.077
Yes, sir.
My team's about to move

16:25.110 --> 16:27.078
on the drone's location now.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.009
Hear the guy in charge on
the ground's a real snake-eater.

16:30.050 --> 16:31.244
Jason Hayes. Yes, sir.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.643
He's a frogman.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.453
You're gonna get
your drone back.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.253
Be happy to keep you updated
throughout the mission.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.780
That won't be necessary,
Commander.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.354
I'm staying right here
to make sure things come off

16:39.390 --> 16:42.052
without a hitch.
Roger that, sir.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.625
A malware issue may not make
people quake in their boots

16:44.670 --> 16:46.626
like rockets lobbed into
the Sea of Japan,

16:46.670 --> 16:49.093
but without drone ISR,
we lose our tactical superiority

16:49.140 --> 16:50.334
over the enemy.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.406
Understood, sir.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.805
We'll get your drone back.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.673
This should keep
things interesting.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.746
What could possibly go wrong
with a cake

17:14.500 --> 17:16.525
JASON :
2, this is 1. Let me know when
you're set for overwatch.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.699
Bravo 1, we're making our way to
OP across the street.

17:18.730 --> 17:19.822
CLAY: I'll be in position
in less than two mikes.

17:19.870 --> 17:21.531
Copy 2.

17:21.570 --> 17:23.128
Okay, let's just hold here
for a second.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.706
SONNY: You know those
dreams where you

17:24.740 --> 17:26.799
show up to your high school,
but you're naked?

17:26.840 --> 17:29.536
_ That's what _it feels like
right now wandering around here

17:29.580 --> 17:31.207
without eyes in the slq.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.209
Go in deep.

17:46.390 --> 17:48.358
Stairwell.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.168
Spenser?

17:58.210 --> 18:00.269
Spenser!

18:00.310 --> 18:02.301
Talk to me, buddy.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.648
Clay!

18:16.490 --> 18:18.685
Clay! Spenser!
CLAY: Yeah.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.699
RAY: Damn it, Spenser,
talk to me, man.

18:21.730 --> 18:23.425
Yeah. Uh, I-I'm good,
man, I'm good.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.494
That's quite a fail
you took there, brother.

18:24.530 --> 18:25.758
How banged up are you?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.234
I'm all right, man.
I'll manage.

18:28.270 --> 18:29.339
All right, man, we're gonna
try to figure out

18:29.370 --> 18:30.439
how to get you out of there.

18:30.470 --> 18:31.437
JASON:
2, this is 1.

18:31.470 --> 18:32.767
How long till overwatch is set?

18:32.810 --> 18:34.539
We have a couple of
night crawlers out here.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.673
They can end our mission
before it starts.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.144
All right, man.
I got to book.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.340
CLAY:
Yeah, yeah.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.540
Go on. I'll...

18:41.580 --> 18:42.740
I'll be right on your six.
I got you.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.611
All right, man.

18:44.650 --> 18:47.312
Look, you get moving
as soon as you can.

19:08.510 --> 19:10.899
Bravo 2, this is Bravo 6.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.913
It-it's Bravo 6.
I'm a little jammed up here.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.819
Ah, damn it.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.260
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.

19:39.310 --> 19:42.404
Be advised, we had an incident
on the way to overwatch.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.907
JASON: What kind of incident?
Spenser fell in the cellar

19:43.950 --> 19:45.372
of the building
we were clearing.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.741
It's gonna take him a minute

19:46.780 --> 19:48.372
to get himself squared away
and over to me.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.980
I hated leaving him.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.511
The clock was ticking.
The kid will be fine.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.982
RAY: He's only rolled with us
a few times.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.749
I'd feel a whole lot better
if it was me down there.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.724
Look, you made the right choice.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.852
You got eyes on our position?

20:11.810 --> 20:13.732
RAY:
Yeah.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.372
We got a couple
midnight strollers

20:15.410 --> 20:16.877
just outside the target area.

20:16.910 --> 20:18.275
Gonna make a path for you.

20:18.310 --> 20:19.800
You two stick with Sonny.

20:19.850 --> 20:21.613
Got it?

20:34.660 --> 20:37.367
RAY: You're good to go.
JASON: Move to target.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.614
Okay.

20:54.650 --> 20:56.971
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.681
Passing Sapphire.
We've got the drone.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.830
(conversation continues
in Arabic)

21:21.110 --> 21:23.374
Scotty. You two,
take the high ground.

21:23.410 --> 21:25.469
Trent, Brock,
hold the front.

21:25.510 --> 21:27.569
Copy that.
Straps.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.042
Let's go. You're up.
Your little toy's here.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.514
Let's open it up and get that
processor out. Let's move.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.984
How long?

21:39.630 --> 21:41.427
How long is it gonna take?

21:41.460 --> 21:43.894
Airframe got deformed on impact.

21:43.930 --> 21:46.398
Gonna take longer to open up the
panel, extract the processor.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.637
Best case, 20 minutes.
No.

21:48.670 --> 21:52.037
You got to halve that. Iraqi
shelling, it's gonna end soon.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.901
2, this is 1.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.578
You got Bravo 6 yet?

21:55.610 --> 21:57.874
RAY: Negative.
I'll raise him on comms.

21:57.910 --> 21:59.446
Bravo 6,
you making your way out?

22:03.550 --> 22:05.017
Bravo 6, do you copy?

22:06.850 --> 22:09.080
(men continue speaking Arabic
nearby)

22:09.120 --> 22:10.382
Bravo 6, do you hear me?

22:47.960 --> 22:49.928
Bravo 6,
you making your way out?

22:53.130 --> 22:55.792
Bravo 6, come in.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.705
Come on, brother.

22:57.740 --> 23:00.129
Bravo 6, this is Bravo 2.
Do you copy?

23:02.780 --> 23:04.475
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.

23:04.510 --> 23:06.000
I can't get Bravo 6
on the comms.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.540
You got eyes on his location?

23:07.580 --> 23:09.047
Copy that. Eyes on.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.809
Looks the same as when I...

23:26.500 --> 23:28.730
Bravo 1,
we got a big problem, boss.

23:28.770 --> 23:30.032
I count three armed men

23:30.070 --> 23:31.867
directly above
Bravo 6's position.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.571
Spenser still safe?

23:33.610 --> 23:35.100
Well, no one's jumping around
like they won the lottery,

23:35.140 --> 23:36.732
so I'm gonna say yes for now.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.600
I can engage and take 'em out
before they get to him,

23:38.650 --> 23:40.811
but I got no way of knowing how
many more guys are down there.

23:40.850 --> 23:42.511
No, hold on that.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.040
Gunfight would just wake up
the neighborhood.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.911
Copy that. Holding.

23:46.950 --> 23:48.554
Watch him, Ray.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.621
Hey.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.220
The bad guys,
they just crashed Clay's party.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.694
We got to get our boy.
Okay, we'll get him.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.664
Mount up, will you?

24:02.770 --> 24:04.909
TOC, Bravo 6 is pinned down.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.237
I'm gonna have to split up
the teams.

24:06.270 --> 24:07.703
Alpha will take the straps
to exfil.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.799
We're gonna go back for the kid.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.671
Copy, Bravo 1.

24:11.710 --> 24:13.974
Is that gonna be enough
rifles to free Bravo 6?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.715
We don't have much
of a choice, do we?

24:15.750 --> 24:17.513
They're not deviating
from the mission.

24:17.550 --> 24:19.211
Sir, w-we have a man in danger.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.854
Give me that.

24:20.890 --> 24:22.619
Bravo 1.

24:22.660 --> 24:24.821
This is General Parsons,
CENTCOM Air Combat Command.

24:24.860 --> 24:26.521
I admire your desire
to get your man,

24:26.560 --> 24:29.222
but recovering the drone's
processor is your priority.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.898
Splitting your forces
is too risky

24:30.930 --> 24:33.262
given the environment.
Forgive me, sir, but...

24:33.300 --> 24:35.666
are you asking me
to leave one of my men behind?

24:35.700 --> 24:37.531
The Iraqi assault's
beginning shortly.

24:37.570 --> 24:39.231
We'll attach a QRF with them.
They'll get your guy out.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.101
All due respect, sir,

24:41.140 --> 24:43.608
it'll take them a day
to move a half a block.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.208
I have thousands
of troops operating

24:45.250 --> 24:47.275
_ in combat zones
Without overwatch now.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.915
Their safety depends on you
delivering that processor.

24:49.950 --> 24:50.848
Is that understood?

24:50.890 --> 24:53.586
Yes, sir.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.759
Zero chance
Jason obeys that order.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.849
Parsons doesn't seem like the
type of guy you want to disobey.

24:57.890 --> 24:59.983
ISR is down.
Maybe that helps us.

25:00.030 --> 25:02.248
Hard to know you've been
disobeyed if you can't see.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.291
SONNY:
Kid's up against it,

25:04.330 --> 25:06.059
and these cake-eaters,
all they care about

25:06.100 --> 25:07.567
is this damn hardware.
Let's go. How much longer?

25:07.600 --> 25:08.862
Least another five minutes.

25:08.900 --> 25:09.867
That's too long.
I'm using all the manpower

25:09.900 --> 25:11.299
given to me.
Get your saw, Sonny.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.103
Open it up.

25:13.140 --> 25:14.676
This ain't brain surgery.

25:16.010 --> 25:17.841
Let me rip this sucker open.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.541
Kick rocks, nerd.

25:19.580 --> 25:20.615
This is a gross violation

25:20.650 --> 25:22.174
of protocol.

25:22.220 --> 25:23.642
He's not cleared to interfere...
I'm sorry.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.679
I can't hear you.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.517
Rip it up!

26:03.730 --> 26:05.049
RAY:
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.

26:05.090 --> 26:06.352
Bravo 6 is about to get
a visitor.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.096
Repeat, Bravo 2.

26:08.130 --> 26:09.757
There's a dude
going down the hole.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.927
Don't open up.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.995
Spenser will be able to handle
business if anything goes down.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.132
Copy that.

26:15.170 --> 26:17.559
Things escalate, I'll unleash
hell on their position.

26:59.380 --> 27:03.271
RAY: Bravo 1, it appears
Bravo 6 just dodged a bullet.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.016
Whatever good karma
that kid has, he just used up.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.154
He's gonna need a little more.

27:10.460 --> 27:13.122
Came all this way
for that tiny thing?
JASON: Hey.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.957
You got everything you need?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.025
Good to go.
Good to go. Okay.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.961
Full Metal, prep to blow
the drone in place.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.366
Then you're gonna escort
the straps to exfil.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.389
We're going after Bravo 6.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.135
Roger that.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.431
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.777
Copy, Bravo 1.

27:31.810 --> 27:32.879
Turquoise.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.844
We on a party line here?

27:40.250 --> 27:41.410
Negaﬁve.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.155
Just us.

27:43.190 --> 27:45.226
Situational awareness,
between you and I,

27:45.260 --> 27:47.285
I'm going back for the kid.
I'm sure the general's

27:47.330 --> 27:49.093
gonna get his balls in a twist
on this one.

27:49.130 --> 27:51.792
Uh, roger that.

27:51.830 --> 27:54.890
IEDs forcing you
to revise your exfil path.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.293
Estimate the current route

27:56.340 --> 27:59.036
will add an additional
15 minutes on the ground.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.833
1 out.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.179
Is there a problem,
Commander?

28:04.210 --> 28:07.247
No, sir.
Situation on the ground's fluid.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.840
Required a slight adjustment
for exfil,

28:09.880 --> 28:12.212
but we're still on track
for a successful recovery.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.956
Good.

28:45.450 --> 28:47.918
Bravo 1, you hear that?

28:47.960 --> 28:49.985
Shelling's ended.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.056
This is when
the zombies come out.

28:52.090 --> 28:53.352
Bravo 1, streets are clear.

28:53.390 --> 28:54.926
You should have smooth sailing
to OP 1.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.518
JASON:
Movmg.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.096
SONNY: Streets are probably
littered with IEDs.

28:58.130 --> 29:00.121
JASON: Well, we're gonna
have to haul ass anyway.

29:00.170 --> 29:01.239
The sun's coming up soon.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.328
Bravo 1, I got eyes
on some weird light show

29:33.370 --> 29:33.995
coming out of that hole.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.029
JASON:
Hold what you got.

29:35.070 --> 29:38.335
Spenser's probably trying
to send up a flare.

29:38.370 --> 29:39.200
Yeah, a good reason.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.935
You guys got a big-ass
antiaircraft gun

29:40.980 --> 29:42.231
pointed right
at your infil point.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.872
You've got to pull back, guys.
JASON: Copy.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.002
Taking cover.
Abort. Abort. Repeat. Abort.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.048
Okay, look, front door's out. We
got to get off the streets now.

29:55.090 --> 29:57.058
First time
the kid saves our asses.

29:57.090 --> 29:58.455
We might actually owe him
a case of beer.

29:58.490 --> 30:01.197
2, this is 1.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.527
From your perspective, anything?

30:02.560 --> 30:04.869
RAY: I've got another problem
myself, boss.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.322
We got more fighters inside.

30:06.370 --> 30:07.860
JASON:
Where the hell'd they come from?

30:07.900 --> 30:09.333
I don't know.

30:09.370 --> 30:10.906
I've been watching the street
the whole time.

30:10.940 --> 30:13.067
It just came out of nowhere.

30:13.110 --> 30:16.477
Remember Mosul when they
came out of nowhere?

30:16.510 --> 30:17.499
Yeah, bad guys dug a tunnel.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.906
Think they did
the same thing here?

30:19.950 --> 30:23.044
Tunnel's our only way in.
We need to find it first.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.310
We could always ask these guys
for directions.

30:25.350 --> 30:27.341
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.881
We're looking for a tunnel
system that leads into OP 1.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.456
MANDY:
Bravo 1, this is TOC. Copy.

30:31.490 --> 30:32.980
It would be considerate of ISIS

30:33.030 --> 30:34.850
to put up signs
to their tunnels next time.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.198
Hmm. They dig inside.
They pile the dirt

30:37.230 --> 30:39.323
from floor to ceiling so as not
to give away their locations.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.395
It's... it's smart.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.089
But not foolproof.

30:43.140 --> 30:45.563
Look at the ground
outside this building.

30:45.610 --> 30:46.907
MANDY:
I don't see anything.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.931
Exactly. Now look
at this picture

30:48.980 --> 30:50.208
from the next day.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.901
What is that pile
right there?

30:51.950 --> 30:53.008
That was not there
the day before.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.608
Excavated dirt.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.140
Artillery shell probably
blew out the window,

30:56.180 --> 30:57.442
caused the dirt
to leak out.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.913
Mm-hmm.
And Clay's position

30:58.950 --> 31:00.110
is the building closest
to that entrance.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.289
They must connect.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.481
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.519
Think we found your way in.

31:25.610 --> 31:28.113
Bravo 2, we're making entry.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.276
Going after our boy.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.208
On my mark. Three...

31:31.250 --> 31:32.182
two...

31:32.220 --> 31:33.380
one.

32:10.490 --> 32:12.048
*

32:18.570 --> 32:20.424
Eagle, eagle.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.097
Eagle, eagle.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.267
Let's go home, Baby Jess.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.538
Come on.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.641
There you go.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.989
Up, move.

32:40.020 --> 32:42.682
Get up, kid.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.621
Look at you, man.
You look like crap.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.527
Way to blow the ovenNatch, kid.
Yeah, he stinks, too.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.289
Oh, it's awesome to see you
guys, too, man. Appreciate that.

32:52.330 --> 32:54.389
FULL METAL:
Bravo 1, this is Alpha 1.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.692
Extract point is getting hot.
Gonna have to exfil soon. Over.

32:56.740 --> 32:58.537
Alpha 1, we're moving.
Move to exfil if you need to.

32:58.570 --> 33:01.175
Let's go home.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.678
Copy that.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.410
JASON: TOC, this is Bravo 1.
We're passing Platinum. Over.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.654
Copy, Bravo 1.

33:17.690 --> 33:19.248
That is Platinum.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.780
They're on their way.

33:20.830 --> 33:23.048
Looks like our man made it out
after all.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.568
Didn't I tell you
we'd bring him home?

33:57.130 --> 33:59.667
*

34:24.360 --> 34:26.089
*

34:29.530 --> 34:31.327
I'll tell you, that
kid over there--

34:31.370 --> 34:33.258
he's a lucky kid,

34:33.300 --> 34:35.837
he's got someone like
you watching over him.

34:35.870 --> 34:38.862
Any lesser operator probably
would have just panicked,

34:38.910 --> 34:40.730
started pumping that
building with bullets,

34:40.770 --> 34:43.603
probably gotten
him killed.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.801
This your way of saying
you're glad to have me back?

34:47.510 --> 34:48.647
How's your arm?

34:48.680 --> 34:51.581
It's good.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.645
Felt like a new man
out there.
Yeah?

34:53.690 --> 34:55.282
Yeah.
That's good.

34:55.320 --> 34:57.151
One that could
strike your ass out.

34:57.190 --> 34:58.487
I don't know about that.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.090
I do.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.195
Yeah.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.788
I see you checking
on everyone.

35:07.830 --> 35:09.491
Who's checking
on you?

35:09.540 --> 35:12.168
Who's checking on me?
Well, that's a rank thing.

35:12.210 --> 35:14.701
I mean, you're only allowed to
check on people below you.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.174
So, you know, you actually
asking me how I'm doing--

35:17.210 --> 35:18.802
that's breaking
the chain of command.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.272
Breaking the chain of command?

35:20.310 --> 35:22.278
Well, it seems
to be going around today.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.515
Yeah.

35:24.550 --> 35:25.778
I think so.

35:25.820 --> 35:29.210
Nice...

35:29.260 --> 35:31.228
family we got, huh?

35:31.260 --> 35:35.492
It's a bunch of misfits
that somehow... fit.

35:36.630 --> 35:38.325
Family.

35:41.500 --> 35:42.933
Get some rest.

35:42.970 --> 35:45.200
Yeah, get some rest.

36:06.660 --> 36:08.628
Thank you.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.298
Hey!

36:10.330 --> 36:12.264
Thank God you're all right.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.927
You are all right, right?
I'm fine. I'm fine.

36:13.970 --> 36:15.597
Yeah, I'm-I'm good.
Don't worry.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.198
Oh, God.
I'm fine. It's...

36:17.240 --> 36:18.434
This, is this...?
Yeah, careful.

36:18.470 --> 36:19.835
Oh, sorry.
My-my knee's good.

36:19.870 --> 36:21.201
I shouldn't
even be here,

36:21.240 --> 36:22.639
but they want to
keep me overnight.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.272
Well, I'm gonna
stay here with you then.

36:24.310 --> 36:25.504
There's actually no way
I'm gonna leave you

36:25.550 --> 36:27.199
in this depressing room.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.877
Yeah, this is
real depressing.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.319
Here, oh,
I got you something.

36:30.350 --> 36:31.749
Thank you.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.246
That was nice. Thanks.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.609
Your shake.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.858
I just want, I want to say
I'm sorry about the other day.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.858
I should have brought up
the deployment thing sooner.
No.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.596
We're not gonna be talking
about that right now.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.427
I just want to, I just want
to pamper you back to health.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.597
And that's it. Here.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.863
So as much as I want
to believe that it isn't true,

36:51.910 --> 36:56.279
we're about to be two people
with 7,000 miles between us.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.602
when w-we're halfway around
the world from each other?

37:00.650 --> 37:03.471
I mean, most of the guys,
you know, in the teams--

37:03.520 --> 37:06.842
they... they all try
and do this, you know,

37:06.890 --> 37:10.610
balancing, you know, their
personal lives with work

37:10.660 --> 37:13.424
by putting a wall
in between them.

37:13.460 --> 37:15.690
I mean, I've-I've
seen it with Jason.

37:15.730 --> 37:18.494
I lived it with my dad.

37:18.530 --> 37:21.397
I don't want... I don't want to
have a relationship

37:21.440 --> 37:22.759
that's defined by walls
and boundaries.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.836
Neither one of us does.

37:27.510 --> 37:29.899
So, what are you saying?

37:32.610 --> 37:36.319
What I'm saying is,
when I was on the plane,

37:36.350 --> 37:38.784
I just...
I kept thinking about you.

37:38.820 --> 37:40.913
You know, because
what we do is we...

37:40.950 --> 37:43.748
we protect people, right?

37:43.790 --> 37:46.327
So if, if I let
you go, then...

37:46.360 --> 37:48.726
then I'd really be keeping you
out of harm's way.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.318
VVhat

37:50.360 --> 37:52.396
I realized that
you...

37:52.430 --> 37:53.829
You're the strongest person
I know.

37:53.870 --> 37:54.894
I mean, you don't need
protecting from anything.

37:57.700 --> 38:00.669
I realized the only thing worse
than not seeing you

38:00.710 --> 38:02.371
for the next three months

38:02.410 --> 38:04.344
would be never
seeing you again.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.644
Okay, well, please, I really...

38:06.680 --> 38:07.977
And so...

38:13.690 --> 38:15.817
Will you marry me?

38:27.830 --> 38:30.367
*

38:41.050 --> 38:42.608
Wow. You look amazing.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.082
I was glad to
hear from you.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.940
I didn't think...
You'd ever hear
from me again?

38:47.990 --> 38:50.618
No. I just didn't think that
you would be up for going out

38:50.660 --> 38:51.979
after you flew to Iraq and
back in the last 72 hours,

38:52.030 --> 38:53.588
but now _that
you mention it,

38:53.630 --> 38:55.825
I figured that the
odds were pretty low

38:55.860 --> 38:57.088
that I'd ever
hear from you.

38:57.130 --> 38:59.064
Well, here I am.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.795
I got you a drink.

39:00.830 --> 39:02.434
No tequila this time.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.633
Is this Japanese single malt?

39:06.670 --> 39:08.774
Yeah, I took a shot
in the dark.

39:08.810 --> 39:11.370
Is there anything that
you and Sonny don't talk about?

39:11.410 --> 39:13.674
You're right.

39:13.710 --> 39:16.110
It's wrong. I shouldn't pump him
for intel about you.

39:16.150 --> 39:18.710
But in my defense,
I need all the help I can get.

39:18.750 --> 39:19.910
You're doing just fine
on your own.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.485
So what should we drink to?

39:23.520 --> 39:24.885
World peace?
Mm.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.557
Awkward mornings after?

39:27.860 --> 39:30.727
How about...

39:30.760 --> 39:33.763
mm, to our second date?

39:59.130 --> 40:01.519
ALANA:
You breach that door,

40:01.560 --> 40:02.754
you buy a new one.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.529
Ah. Hi.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.128
I didn't see you there.

40:07.630 --> 40:09.860
Everyone okay?

40:09.900 --> 40:13.438
Yeah, everyone's good.

40:13.470 --> 40:15.529
Good.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.468
You want to sit?

40:22.920 --> 40:24.683
Yeah, I can sit.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.187
Yeah.

40:36.930 --> 40:39.194
Well, it's later.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.562
It is that.

40:42.970 --> 40:45.905
Oh.

40:45.940 --> 40:48.067
Whew, I'm tired.

40:50.180 --> 40:54.469
Look, about what
Mikey said...

40:54.520 --> 40:56.545
Don't have to explain,
Alana.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.844
Yes, I do.
It wasn't fair,

40:58.890 --> 41:02.155
blindside you
like that.

41:02.190 --> 41:05.159
Anyway, I talked
to Mikey, and...

41:05.190 --> 41:06.987
I cleared up
any confusion.

41:08.530 --> 41:10.657
Thanks.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.531
Hey?
Yeah.

41:17.570 --> 41:20.164
You all right?

41:20.210 --> 41:24.499
Yeah, this mission just went
a little haywire, and, uh,

41:24.550 --> 41:26.142
new kid had a close call.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.819
Clay?
Yeah, Clay.

41:28.850 --> 41:30.909
Is he okay?

41:30.950 --> 41:32.713
Yeah, he's...

41:32.750 --> 41:36.652
Some scratches, but, um,
yeah, he got lucky.

41:36.690 --> 41:38.829
Baptism by fire.

41:38.860 --> 41:40.885
Yeah.

41:40.930 --> 41:43.694
Baptism by fire.

41:43.730 --> 41:45.994
How come you never asked me
to leave the teams?

41:48.070 --> 41:50.630
Because it's
who you are.

41:50.670 --> 41:54.572
Wasn't always,
but... now it is.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.073
I've made my
peace with it.

41:59.110 --> 42:01.101
So then why am I, uh,
not living here,

42:01.150 --> 42:04.244
and just coming by visiting
every so often?

42:08.760 --> 42:12.150
You ever think about
what comes after?

42:12.190 --> 42:14.829
Nobody kicks down
doors forever.

42:14.860 --> 42:17.158
Well, come on.
What do you want me to do?

42:17.200 --> 42:20.021
Open up some tactical
training business,

42:20.070 --> 42:22.834
and teach suburban accountants
how to survwe Armageddon?

42:22.870 --> 42:23.939
It would pay better.

42:23.970 --> 42:25.835
A lot better.

42:25.870 --> 42:27.758
Wouldn't have to worry
about money for college.

42:27.810 --> 42:29.675
Oh.

42:29.710 --> 42:33.646
I could sleep 300
more days a year.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.170
Hmm.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.541
Nicer vacations.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.682
Good-bye to the
Ozark water park.

42:42.720 --> 42:45.689
I like the Ozark
water park, okay, so...

42:45.730 --> 42:47.686
Really?
Yes, really.

42:47.730 --> 42:49.823
Okay, so maybe we don't say
good-bye to the water park.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.964
No way.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.161
But we could say
hello to Italy.

42:54.200 --> 42:57.761
Maybe Hawaii,
tranquil beaches.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.961
Nothing to do all
day but... sleep.
