00:02.203 --> 00:03.369
"Imposters"...
- Where did you hide the ring?

00:03.371 --> 00:06.472
- Um, you're not gonna
like it.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.707
-<i> So this ring,</i>
<i> how much is it worth?</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:10.309
- At least $1 million.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.511
- Okay, I'll help you.
- Yeah?

00:12.513 --> 00:15.247
- But when you get it back,
I get 10% of the ring.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.548
- Okay.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.251
- Tell me more
about Sofia.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.421
-<i> I know a lot</i>
<i> about punishment--</i>

00:22.423 --> 00:24.390
the punisher,
the punished,

00:24.392 --> 00:26.392
the one who says,
"That's enough."

00:26.394 --> 00:27.659
Off you go.

00:27.661 --> 00:31.230
- [yelling]

00:31.232 --> 00:32.631
- Calm down!

00:32.633 --> 00:34.466
-<i> Look, we had a problem here.</i>

00:34.468 --> 00:36.268
<i> I'm very sorry.</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.469
<i> It wasn't supposed</i>
<i> to go down this way.</i>

00:37.471 --> 00:39.338
- Here it is, Ezra.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.373
You and Julia and Richard--

00:41.375 --> 00:44.343
until further notice,
you work for me.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.744
- This is Charlotte Grovesnor.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.213
Miss Grovesnor lives
in Burlington, Vermont,

00:48.215 --> 00:52.418
and is one of the foremost
collectors of Toby jugs.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.786
Just get
the saffron diamond ring,

00:53.788 --> 00:55.587
deliver it to the Doctor,

00:55.589 --> 00:57.256
and then you can go
your bumbling little way.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.791
- Time to make our move.

00:58.793 --> 01:01.360
The Doctor, we're gonna
stab him in the back, Maxie,

01:01.362 --> 01:02.528
and then in the front

01:02.530 --> 01:04.663
<i> and then maybe on both sides.</i>

01:04.665 --> 01:06.432
<i> We all want out</i>
<i> from under his thumb.</i>

01:06.434 --> 01:07.566
<i> - We're gonna put together</i>

01:07.568 --> 01:09.268
everything
we've ever learned--

01:09.270 --> 01:12.004
every trick, every sleight
of hand, every scam.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.472
We're gonna hunt him down,

01:13.474 --> 01:14.773
and before we deliver him
to the FBI,

01:14.775 --> 01:17.443
we'll take him
for everything he's got.

01:19.380 --> 01:23.449
- Systemic release of metals
with carcinogenic potential.

01:23.451 --> 01:27.286
Despite the conspicuous apathy
displayed by my colleagues,

01:27.288 --> 01:28.654
there can be no doubt

01:28.656 --> 01:31.790
that leaving osteopathic
fixation devices in situ

01:31.792 --> 01:33.992
should be considered
nothing short of malpractice.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.727
- Doctor.
Doctor.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.763
I'm sorry; do you have
a question for the panel?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.465
- I'm coming to that.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.799
- Because we have colleagues
who do have questions.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.401
- Then I'll continue.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.336
If you'll try to follow
my thinking,

01:44.338 --> 01:47.406
the only reason to not remove
an implant

01:47.408 --> 01:48.774
would be the incompetency
of the surgeon.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.043
- We followed just fine,
Jeffrey.

01:51.045 --> 01:53.378
But if we're talking about
implant removal,

01:53.380 --> 01:54.913
maybe--you know, just maybe--

01:54.915 --> 01:57.349
someone should finally remove
that stick from your ass.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.984
[scattered laughter]

01:58.986 --> 02:00.719
- And that's all the time
we have for questions,

02:00.721 --> 02:03.355
so I guess I'll see you all
at happy hour.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.611

Is that understood?

03:41.822 --> 03:43.522
- [sighs]

03:43.524 --> 03:45.657
- Then let's begin.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.659
Your mark
is Charlotte Grovesnor.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.529
<i> She's 38, divorced, no kids.</i>

03:50.531 --> 03:52.631
<i> Modest, independent means.</i>

<i> She goes there for one thing</i>
<i> and one thing only.</i>

03:59.106 --> 04:00.472
- Hello, there.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.374
Can I interest you
in an Amish quilt?

04:02.376 --> 04:05.444
Or perhaps a Jan McLean doll?

04:05.446 --> 04:08.247
Or maybe a Toby jug.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.657
- No, thank you.
Not for me.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.627
- Ah, here we are.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.029
$350, was it?

04:24.031 --> 04:26.832
- 350 it is
for the very rare Toby jug.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.667
- Glad it's still here.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.136
- I'll box that up for you.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.572
- You're charging this man 350

04:33.574 --> 04:35.407
for a Royal Doulton
Dick Turpin.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.576
- No, it's a very rare
1935 Royal Worchester.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.145
- You expect anyone
to believe that?

04:40.147 --> 04:41.713
- Sorry, what seems
to be the trouble?

04:41.715 --> 04:44.883
- Nothing.
This lady's just confused.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.718
- Excuse me.
I happen to be an expert.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.522
And that thing
is not worth more than $45.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.491
- Oh, my.
- Hey.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.760
If you mess with my livelihood,

04:54.762 --> 04:56.495
I will knock you on your ass.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.163
- Knock me?

04:58.165 --> 05:00.032
- Surely there's no cause
to threaten the lady.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.668
- This right here
is no lady.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.736
- I'm canceling my sale.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.039
- Hey, Downton Abbey,
read the sign.

05:07.041 --> 05:10.509
All sales are final.
We're closed.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.477
- Excuse me.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.812
- Hey!
Uh-uh.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.149
- It's my money.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.528
- This is outrageous.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.696
Instead of us,
why don't you throw out

05:30.698 --> 05:32.197
that absolute fraud in there?

05:34.268 --> 05:38.603
That was very kind of you.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.238
- Oh, I should be
thanking you.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.740
I'd never have known

05:41.742 --> 05:43.208
I was being taken
for such a fool.

05:43.210 --> 05:47.779
- Yeah, that kind of dishonesty
is just disgusting.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.148
- Oh, how rude of me.
I'm Clive.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.650
I'm Clive Rhumegai.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.553
- Charlotte.
Uh, Grovesnor.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.288
Nice to meet you, Clive.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.657
[both chuckle]

05:58.659 --> 05:59.658
Good luck to you.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.860
- And to you.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.665
- After working for someone
for over ten years,

06:06.667 --> 06:09.000
you'd think you'd know a hell
of a lot more about them.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.236
- Well, let's assume
Cy's right.

06:11.238 --> 06:14.005
The Doctor<i> is</i> a real doctor,
lives in Buffalo.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.774
That's still
quite the haystack.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.543
Where in Buffalo?
What kind of doctor?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.679
Where does he like
to go to dinner?

06:20.681 --> 06:23.615
- Holy shit, I bet you
everything I own

06:23.617 --> 06:26.084
that he's
an orthopedic surgeon.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.019
- Max, you own nothing.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.022
- Yes, well, call it
a hunch then, okay?

06:31.024 --> 06:34.760
Ah, this is the pen he used
when I went to see him.

06:34.762 --> 06:35.794
I pocketed it.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.195
It's a flag pen.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.598
They hand them out
at special events...

06:39.600 --> 06:41.833
like medical conferences.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.269
- Well, well,
a good place to start.

06:44.271 --> 06:47.639
- There's no record of him
on the guest list, no pictures.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.274
Shit.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.576
- Well, there are probably
more pictures, right?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.779
He'd probably try
not to get photographed.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.014
What is that?

06:56.016 --> 07:00.619
- Official conference
photographer, Allen Klugemar.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.788
- Well, he should be
easy to get to.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.024
<i> [music playing</i>
<i> in the distance]</i>

07:06.026 --> 07:09.127
- What?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.163
- You're enjoying this.

07:11.165 --> 07:13.865
- No, I'm not.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.634
I'm owning it.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.870
There's a difference.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.940
I've learned
not to punish myself anymore,

07:21.942 --> 07:25.143
that the choices I've made,
the things that I've done,

07:25.145 --> 07:26.845
there's the punished,
the punisher--

07:26.847 --> 07:29.247
- And the one that says,
"That's enough. Off you go."

07:29.249 --> 07:32.818
Yeah, I heard that little
Lenny Cohen speech before.

07:32.820 --> 07:36.321
I'd take it
with a grain of salt, Jules.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.256
Lenny's insane.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.664
- Can I get a latte, please?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.165
You can go easy on the foam.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.201
Thank you.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.308
- I told him I don't do
Vermont. I do Manhattan.

if I'm feeling adventurous.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.380

they pay for the smaller ones.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.717
- Yeah, I know.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.486
All right, got to go.
Arigato.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.791
Well, this is predictably
terrible.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.159
Where is Clive?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.761
- Oh, he just texted.
Running behind.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.364
- Peeping in every
antique shop window, no doubt.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.066
He's obsessed.

Why, hello.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.826

08:47.828 --> 08:49.828
- Um, excuse me, ladies.
This is, um...

08:49.830 --> 08:51.229
- Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.298
Yes, she and I met
in rather sort of

08:53.300 --> 08:56.067
an unexpected fashion
at the antique mall.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.302
- Mm, adorable.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.004
- Could you just give me
a second?

08:59.006 --> 09:00.105
- I was just leaving.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.306
- No, I'm so sorry.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.409
I was so flustered yesterday
that I--

09:04.411 --> 09:06.411
well, I completely forgot
to ask.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.413
You're an expert
in Toby jugs,

09:08.415 --> 09:10.415
and the thing is, I'm on
a bit of a mission

09:10.417 --> 09:13.418
to find just the right sort,
and I was wondering

09:13.420 --> 09:15.120
if I could take you
to lunch tomorrow.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.421
- Lunch?
- Yeah.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.089
Just to pick your brain,
as it were.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.091
I mean, if that wouldn't be
too much of a chore.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.426
- Lunch...

09:21.428 --> 09:24.129
would be nice, sure.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.297
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

09:25.299 --> 09:27.098
- Oh, um, sorry.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.034
- [laughs]
- Got it, right.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.435
That's my card.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.503
Text me the time and place,
and I'll--

09:31.505 --> 09:33.271
I'll see you there.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.806
Very much looking forward
to it, Charlotte.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.908
- Yeah.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.812
- Well, look at you.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.382
You're a natural.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.483
- [clicks tongue]

09:51.361 --> 09:53.629
- Ugh, so much food.

09:53.631 --> 09:55.565
- So much free food.

09:55.567 --> 09:58.000
Working for the Doctor
does have perks.

09:58.002 --> 09:59.569
Maddie's just bitter.

09:59.571 --> 10:01.237
- What am I bitter about?

10:01.239 --> 10:05.308
- Oh, hey!

10:05.310 --> 10:06.475
- Charlotte took the bait.

10:06.477 --> 10:08.110
Lunch is a go.

10:08.112 --> 10:10.079
- A long-form distraction con
only works

10:10.081 --> 10:12.448
if you know your contingencies,
if you've done your homework,

10:12.450 --> 10:15.952
and I'm not seeing
much studying.

10:15.954 --> 10:18.120
- She keeps a house key
in a fake rock.

10:18.122 --> 10:22.058
All we have to do is sneak in,
find the jug, get the ring.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.259
Mic drop!

10:23.261 --> 10:24.994
[folder thuds]

10:24.996 --> 10:27.530
- What if the ring
isn't in the jug?

10:27.532 --> 10:30.166
- Then that's on the Doctor.
It's his intel.

10:30.168 --> 10:33.202
- [sighs] And you really think
he's gonna see it that way?

10:33.204 --> 10:35.104
- We know what we're doing.

10:35.106 --> 10:36.339
- You do?

10:36.341 --> 10:38.307
Well, maybe you don't need me,
then.

10:38.309 --> 10:40.476
- Maybe we don't.

10:46.184 --> 10:48.451
- Good luck.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.224
-<i> I'm fine.</i>

10:55.226 --> 10:57.059
- You're not fine.
I can tell.

10:57.061 --> 10:58.394
I'm intuitive.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.997
- Did you sign up
for Word of the Day?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.332
- I need your head
in the game.

11:03.334 --> 11:05.501
- It is.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.472
Maddie said something.

11:09.474 --> 11:11.173
It got under my skin.

11:11.175 --> 11:13.509
- Well, that's what she does.

11:13.511 --> 11:17.079
- I know; I just thought
I had a breakthrough,

11:17.081 --> 11:19.282
and now I don't know.

11:22.086 --> 11:25.021
- Well, you know what's better
than a breakthrough?

11:25.023 --> 11:26.222
A break-in.

11:28.026 --> 11:30.259
- Let's just get
the stupid ring.

11:30.261 --> 11:31.527
[car engine turns over]

11:31.529 --> 11:35.364
- So what part of England
are you from?

11:35.366 --> 11:37.500
I'm not sure
I can place your accent.

11:37.502 --> 11:39.135
- Oh.
[laughs]

11:39.137 --> 11:42.571
Well, I'm--
I'm from Notting Hill.

11:42.573 --> 11:46.375
Mostly from--my accent's
from "Notting Hill."

11:46.377 --> 11:49.378
Well, this looks lovely.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.680
- Certainly better

11:50.682 --> 11:53.049
than what you must be used to
back home.

11:54.185 --> 11:57.219
Uh, the food in Britain...

11:57.221 --> 11:59.522
- Oh.

11:59.524 --> 12:01.123
- I'm sorry.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.759
I shouldn't have said that
about the food.

12:03.761 --> 12:06.362
I've never actually been
to England.

12:06.364 --> 12:09.198
I'd like to go...
maybe.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.033
I don't--I don't know,
someday.

12:11.035 --> 12:12.535
- Well, you should.
- I don't like to travel.

12:12.537 --> 12:16.739
In general, I find dealing
with people, strangers

12:16.741 --> 12:18.207
problematic.

12:18.209 --> 12:20.209
- I see.

12:20.211 --> 12:21.577
Mm.

12:23.181 --> 12:26.248
So when did you start
collecting Tobies?

12:26.250 --> 12:28.284
- Oh, when I was 26.

12:28.286 --> 12:30.753
Yeah, I saw
a whitewashed Phillips

12:30.755 --> 12:33.289
at a fair,
and it charmed me.

12:33.291 --> 12:35.224
And I bought it on a lark,

12:35.226 --> 12:38.361
and then I was off
to the races.

12:38.363 --> 12:39.462
- [chuckles]

12:39.464 --> 12:41.230
- What about you?

12:41.232 --> 12:43.265
- Uh, well, I'm--
I'm new to it, really.

12:43.267 --> 12:44.633
- Yes.

12:44.635 --> 12:48.571
- My father, uh, he--
[clears throat]

12:48.573 --> 12:51.073
He, uh--
he loved them,

12:51.075 --> 12:52.608
had some in the pub he ran.

12:52.610 --> 12:55.344
So when I decided to open
a hotel and pub here,

12:55.346 --> 12:59.248
well, any pub of mine will have
its fair share of Toby jugs.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.750
- Hooray!

13:00.752 --> 13:02.084
- I'm not off
to the best start, really,

13:02.086 --> 13:03.319
collecting-wise.

13:03.321 --> 13:05.087
Thank goodness
you stepped in.

13:05.089 --> 13:07.757
- The antique business
is just filled with hucksters.

13:07.759 --> 13:10.793
- I supposed I could use
a good tutor.

13:14.332 --> 13:17.199
- Any Toby jugs?

13:17.201 --> 13:19.402
- A few in the bedroom.

13:21.139 --> 13:23.506
I checked them all, though.
No ring.

13:23.508 --> 13:25.141
- [sighs]

13:25.143 --> 13:26.542
Shit.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.611
- And this one--
okay, see this right here?

13:28.613 --> 13:30.479
- Yeah, I see.
- It folds down.

13:30.481 --> 13:32.281
That's a mistake.

13:32.283 --> 13:36.819
Yeah, which makes this one
very, very rare and valuable.

13:36.821 --> 13:39.288
- I see.
[laughs]

13:39.290 --> 13:40.856
Splendid.
- Yeah.

13:40.858 --> 13:43.359
- Oh, my apologies.

13:43.361 --> 13:45.327
Work is a little, um...

13:48.366 --> 13:51.167
So sorry.

13:51.169 --> 13:52.301
Valuable...
- Mm-hmm.

13:52.303 --> 13:53.302
- You were saying.
- Yes.

13:53.304 --> 13:55.371
- Well, that must be--

13:55.373 --> 13:57.473
you must take great care
to keep them safe.

13:57.475 --> 13:58.808
- Oh, I do.

13:58.810 --> 14:01.310
I have built
a climate-controlled room.

14:01.312 --> 14:03.679
It's sort of elaborate,
I guess, but--

14:03.681 --> 14:05.815
- Your jugs are worth it.

14:05.817 --> 14:07.817
Oh, God.
- [laughs]

14:07.819 --> 14:09.819
- Sorry.
Silly me.

14:09.821 --> 14:12.188
- Well, you're not
the first one to notice.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.256
- [laughs]
Oh.

14:14.258 --> 14:17.326
Anyway,
this climate-controlled room?

14:17.328 --> 14:18.527
- Oh, I certainly hope

14:18.529 --> 14:20.196
you're not just interested
in my jugs.

14:20.198 --> 14:21.897
- No, no, just the room.

14:21.899 --> 14:24.166
Just the room.
In the attic, was it?

14:24.168 --> 14:25.534
- No, it's a cellar.

14:25.536 --> 14:27.870
But not just anyone
gets to play around with--

14:27.872 --> 14:29.672
- Yes, yes, of course.

14:29.674 --> 14:31.540
Sorry, I just need to--
just excuse me one second.

14:31.542 --> 14:34.376
I just need the loo.

14:36.414 --> 14:39.548
[laughter]

14:47.191 --> 14:49.258
- Hello?
-<i> Okay, listen.</i>

14:49.260 --> 14:50.860
It's in the cellar, okay?

14:50.862 --> 14:52.394
You got to get down there.
It's in a whole room.

14:52.396 --> 14:53.796
She's got a whole room
of these things.

14:53.798 --> 14:55.197
- He says there's a cellar?

14:55.199 --> 14:56.565
- Yeah, off the pantry.

14:56.567 --> 14:58.734
-<i> What do you mean,</i>
<i> off the pantry?</i>

14:58.736 --> 15:00.369
- My mom never would have kept
a Toby jug in a cellar.

15:00.371 --> 15:02.204
- Jesus Christ, Richard.

15:02.206 --> 15:04.907
Yeah, down we go, Ez.

15:06.777 --> 15:08.444
Cellar.

15:09.881 --> 15:11.847
- Ah, yes.

15:13.451 --> 15:15.184
No.
[handle rattling]

15:15.186 --> 15:17.286
Oh, come on!
- Shit.

15:17.288 --> 15:18.954
- [grunting]

15:23.327 --> 15:25.427
- Oh, are we done already?

15:25.429 --> 15:27.263
- I'm sorry.
I really have to go.

15:27.265 --> 15:28.497
- So soon?

15:28.499 --> 15:30.232
But we were having
such a lovely time.

15:30.234 --> 15:31.467
- I shouldn't have had
that second glass of wine.

15:31.469 --> 15:33.168
It's inappropriate.

15:33.170 --> 15:34.203
- No, not at all.
It was--

15:34.205 --> 15:38.474
- I saw that look
of disgust on your face.

15:38.476 --> 15:39.508
I know that look.

15:39.510 --> 15:41.410
- No, no, please.
It was--

15:41.412 --> 15:42.578
At least let me walk you
to your car.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.313
- No, thank you.
Good-bye.

15:45.850 --> 15:47.316
[device chimes]

15:47.318 --> 15:49.318
- And shit,
their lunch is over.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.786
- Shit!

15:50.788 --> 15:51.921
- Ezra thinks
she might be headed back.

15:51.923 --> 15:53.756
- What?
Phase two sucks.

15:53.758 --> 15:55.991
- Totally.

15:55.993 --> 15:58.427
<i> - What happened there, man?</i>
<i> - I don't know.</i>

15:58.429 --> 16:00.496
Everything was going great.
We were having fun.

16:00.498 --> 16:02.264
We're drinking wine, and--

16:02.266 --> 16:04.366
and she starts getting,
like, flirty, you know?

16:04.368 --> 16:06.435
Like, really flirty.

16:06.437 --> 16:08.437
And she sort of freaked out and
got embarrassed or something.

16:08.439 --> 16:10.239
- Flirty?
- Yeah.

16:10.241 --> 16:11.273
- That's good.
What's the problem?

16:11.275 --> 16:12.942
- What's the problem?

16:12.944 --> 16:14.777
- It sounds like "semi-shy lady
who wants to love again" shit.

16:14.779 --> 16:15.978
You got to lean into that.

16:15.980 --> 16:17.680
- You want me to seduce her?

16:17.682 --> 16:20.449
[chuckles] No, no,
that was not the play here.

16:20.451 --> 16:22.518
- Okay, no, not seduce

16:22.520 --> 16:27.289
but like what he said,
"lean in" to her...

16:27.291 --> 16:30.326
romantic desire for you.

16:34.398 --> 16:37.833
- We're all aware
of the insane irony here.

16:37.835 --> 16:39.835
- Of course we are.

16:39.837 --> 16:41.303
- We're not heartless.

16:41.305 --> 16:43.539
- No,
you just need me to be.

16:43.541 --> 16:45.341
Unbelievable.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.980
- Where are you going?

16:50.982 --> 16:52.915
[door shuts]

17:18.778 --> 17:20.879
- The only way
we're getting in that basement

17:20.881 --> 17:22.047
is if Charlotte lets me in.

17:22.049 --> 17:23.282
And the only way
she lets me in--

17:23.284 --> 17:25.217
- Is if you give her
what she wants.

17:25.219 --> 17:26.885
- You mean deceive her

17:26.887 --> 17:28.053
into thinking
I'm in love with her.

17:28.055 --> 17:29.888
- Look, you want my advice?

17:29.890 --> 17:32.091
Find another way
to get that ring.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.159
Sledgehammer, maybe.

17:34.161 --> 17:36.895
The next part's not for you.

17:36.897 --> 17:38.831
- What does that mean?
What part?

17:38.833 --> 17:42.034
- The next part, the hard part.

17:42.036 --> 17:43.235
It's not for people like you.

17:43.237 --> 17:45.904
People like you
are better than me.

17:45.906 --> 17:49.074
Aren't you better than me?

17:55.783 --> 18:00.252
- Tell me the hard part,
Maddie.

18:04.925 --> 18:09.094
- You want to know how I got
you to fall in love with me?

18:09.096 --> 18:11.196
It's not a con.

18:11.198 --> 18:17.202
You have to show that person
a part of your true self.

18:17.204 --> 18:20.038
Then you need to find something
in that person

18:20.040 --> 18:24.743
that you can really, truly
fall in love with.

18:24.745 --> 18:26.812
That's how you do what I do.

18:28.315 --> 18:32.117
You should be very careful,
Ezra.

18:32.119 --> 18:35.988
Some people are really hard
to get over.

18:39.026 --> 18:40.025
- What kind of lens is this?

18:40.027 --> 18:41.126
- I'm sorry, Detective.

18:41.128 --> 18:43.028
Can you please put that down?

18:43.030 --> 18:46.298
- Mr. Klugemar, this doesn't
have to be so complicated.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.366
- I can't just give
my work over

18:47.368 --> 18:48.901
to the police, not without--

18:48.903 --> 18:50.202
- I'm really getting
into Instagram.

18:50.204 --> 18:51.904
You know Instagram?
- Sir, please.

18:51.906 --> 18:54.706
It's very expensive equipment.
- No shit. How much?

18:54.708 --> 18:56.975
- My livelihood.
- Whoa, whoa.

18:56.977 --> 18:58.710
Excuse me.

18:58.712 --> 19:00.245
- All right, let's come back
with a warrant.

19:00.247 --> 19:02.681
- When we come back, we just
need the photographs, right?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.650
I mean, we don't need to take
all his equipment.

19:04.652 --> 19:07.152
- We get a warrant, we can take
whatever we goddam please.

19:07.154 --> 19:09.321
- Oof.
It's his livelihood.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.158
- [sighs]

19:13.160 --> 19:15.027
Thumb drive okay?

19:21.836 --> 19:23.902
- Hello?
-<i> Hi, Charlotte.</i>

19:23.904 --> 19:27.005
It's Clive.

19:27.007 --> 19:28.106
- Hello.

19:28.108 --> 19:30.742
-<i> I just wanted to call.</i>

19:30.744 --> 19:33.879
I couldn't bear the thought
that I'd offended you somehow.

19:39.253 --> 19:42.721
I'm afraid I--

19:42.723 --> 19:43.889
I haven't quite been myself

19:43.891 --> 19:45.357
<i> these last few days.</i>

19:45.359 --> 19:48.894
<i> I've been keeping my head up,</i>
<i> but...</i>

19:48.896 --> 19:52.764
the loss is--is taking a toll.

19:52.766 --> 19:56.001
- Your--your father?

19:57.771 --> 19:59.037
- Yes, my father.

19:59.039 --> 20:03.308
- I'm sorry.

20:03.310 --> 20:04.409
Th--

20:07.047 --> 20:09.882
- Hello?

20:09.884 --> 20:12.117
<i> Clive?</i>

20:14.221 --> 20:17.256
- Yeah, I'm here.
Um...

20:17.258 --> 20:21.059
Sorry if I was off at lunch.

20:21.061 --> 20:22.861
The truth is...

20:25.766 --> 20:27.799
The truth is, I feel connected
to you, Charlotte.

20:27.801 --> 20:30.903
<i> I--I don't know</i>
<i> quite how to explain it,</i>

20:30.905 --> 20:34.406
<i> but I feel it very strongly.</i>

20:34.408 --> 20:36.275
<i> And unless I'm crazy,</i>

20:36.277 --> 20:40.279
which is entirely possible,

20:40.281 --> 20:41.880
I think you feel it too.

20:48.255 --> 20:51.790
- Do you think Lenny's insane?

20:51.792 --> 20:53.025
- I mean, I'm not
a mental health professional,

20:53.027 --> 20:56.295
but, like, yeah.

20:58.265 --> 21:03.135

35:31.273 --> 35:32.939
- Our problem's not with you.

35:32.941 --> 35:35.108
We're here
about Dr. Jeffrey Hull.

35:42.751 --> 35:44.017
- Can we buy you breakfast?

35:44.019 --> 35:45.752
- You used to work
in orthopedics.

35:45.754 --> 35:47.220
Is that right?

35:47.222 --> 35:49.756
- Orthopedic surgery.

35:49.758 --> 35:52.992
Now I supervise
the graveyard shift.

35:52.994 --> 35:55.495
Think human beings
are innately good?

35:55.497 --> 35:57.197
Work a night in the ER.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.799
- What happened
to your hand?

35:59.801 --> 36:03.503
- I got attacked
with a broken highball glass.

36:03.505 --> 36:04.971
Severed two tendons.

36:04.973 --> 36:07.474
I might never operate again.

36:07.476 --> 36:12.378
Police found nothing,
but I think it was him.

36:12.380 --> 36:15.215
- You think Jeffrey Hull
is the one who attacked you?

36:15.217 --> 36:16.516
- I didn't see his face.

36:16.518 --> 36:19.052
But yes.

36:19.054 --> 36:20.487
- Why would he do that?

36:20.489 --> 36:22.222
- We were at a conference

36:22.224 --> 36:24.023
earlier this year.

36:24.025 --> 36:26.993
I made a remark
just off the cuff,

36:26.995 --> 36:30.196
but I embarrassed him,
and so he hurt me.

36:30.198 --> 36:31.531
Badly.

36:31.533 --> 36:33.500
I should have just
given him a spot.

36:33.502 --> 36:35.335
I knew he was arrogant.

36:35.337 --> 36:38.004
I just didn't know he was
a complete psychopath.

36:38.006 --> 36:39.506
- What do you mean, a spot?

36:39.508 --> 36:41.174
- He applies
every six months

36:41.176 --> 36:42.275
to present a paper
at the conference.

36:42.277 --> 36:44.978
Wants to lecture us,

36:44.980 --> 36:46.146
prove he's the smartest guy
in the room,

36:46.148 --> 36:47.981
which he very may well be,

36:47.983 --> 36:50.984
but it's like he just wants
to rub our faces in it.

36:50.986 --> 36:53.920
A guy that smart,
and he only wants people

36:53.922 --> 36:56.122
to kiss his ass.

36:56.124 --> 36:59.058
Just please tell me

36:59.060 --> 37:01.161
that you're suing him
for something juicy.

37:01.163 --> 37:03.329
-<i> Sort of strange, isn't it,</i>

37:03.331 --> 37:06.166
to realize the Doctor's human,

37:06.168 --> 37:08.468
find his Achilles heel?

37:08.470 --> 37:11.171
- Everybody's got one.

37:11.173 --> 37:13.206
- You did some great work, Sal.

37:13.208 --> 37:15.341
Right?
Just like the old days.

37:15.343 --> 37:17.010
Hand in glove.

37:17.012 --> 37:20.013
Hey, you know,
it's still pretty early.

37:20.015 --> 37:22.182
Why don't we treat ourselves?
We earned it.

37:22.184 --> 37:24.250
- It's 8:00 a.m.

37:24.252 --> 37:25.518
- Mimosas, then.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.921
- Oh.

37:27.923 --> 37:29.956
There's no friends
in the game, Max,

37:29.958 --> 37:32.425
only cons and suckers.

37:32.427 --> 37:34.494
I think
you taught me that.

38:02.991 --> 38:07.560
- I used to be able
to reach you.

38:07.562 --> 38:11.130
- Well, I used to have
nothing to hide.

38:18.139 --> 38:21.407
- I think we need
some light in here.

38:30.585 --> 38:34.187
Tell me about this girl
in Mexico.

38:34.189 --> 38:36.556
Remember, I told you
you'd find love again.

38:36.558 --> 38:38.524
Is she the one?

38:38.526 --> 38:40.260
- Can we--can we not--

38:40.262 --> 38:42.295
- I'm just wondering why
you left her behind.

38:42.297 --> 38:45.131
- You have no idea what
you're talking about, okay?

38:45.133 --> 38:47.967
- Or maybe you just did
what you had to do.

38:47.969 --> 38:49.435
- Don't do that.

38:49.437 --> 38:50.970
- Don't do what?

38:50.972 --> 38:52.939
- Commiserate with me,

38:52.941 --> 38:54.374
act like we're the same.

38:54.376 --> 38:58.177
- I think we're more alike
than you want to admit.

38:58.179 --> 39:01.314
Who came to whose room
last night?

39:03.151 --> 39:06.185
- Well, you know what?
That was clearly a mistake.

39:08.256 --> 39:10.490
- And yet you knocked
on my door.

39:10.492 --> 39:13.293
What was that for?

39:13.295 --> 39:15.061
Hmm?

39:15.063 --> 39:17.363
To get your apology?

39:17.365 --> 39:20.466
Or maybe you had something else
you wanted to say to me.

39:20.468 --> 39:24.003
Maybe to thank me?

39:24.005 --> 39:25.471
- You think I'm
gonna thank you?

39:25.473 --> 39:28.341
- Go on.
I'm ready.

39:29.311 --> 39:31.444
I want the words.

39:32.414 --> 39:34.013
- You're insane.

39:34.015 --> 39:35.648
- And you're full of shit.

39:35.650 --> 39:38.318
You always cry about how
you wanted a life of adventure.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.320
Well, guess who gave it to you

39:40.322 --> 39:41.988
'cause you didn't have
the balls

39:41.990 --> 39:43.957
to go out there
and get it yourself.

39:43.959 --> 39:46.993
I didn't ruin your life, Ezra.

39:46.995 --> 39:48.127
I saved it.

39:48.129 --> 39:50.396
So go ahead;

39:50.398 --> 39:53.132
