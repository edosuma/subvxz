01:01.854 --> 01:03.731
<i>"112".</i>

01:04.941 --> 01:06.817
<i>"112".</i>

01:09.303 --> 01:11.381
<i>This is "112".</i>

01:11.914 --> 01:13.991
<i>"112", why didn't you reply?</i>

01:15.618 --> 01:17.436
Fire in the engine.

01:17.784 --> 01:20.537
<i>Can I use the extinguisher?</i>

01:20.815 --> 01:22.400
Belay extinguisher!

01:22.500 --> 01:24.402
<i>You won't be able
to start the engine again!</i>

01:24.502 --> 01:25.936
That's affirmative.

01:28.397 --> 01:31.325
Drift down to 3000 feet,
aim the plane to the field...

01:31.425 --> 01:33.286
...and bail out, copy?

01:33.386 --> 01:35.279
That's affirmative, drifting down.

01:53.514 --> 01:57.167
Markelov, did you prepare the plane?
Markelov, are you deaf or what?

01:57.350 --> 01:59.378
Did you remove the pin
from the catapult?

02:01.739 --> 02:05.167
<i>"112", Leonov.
What's going on there?</i>

02:09.170 --> 02:11.549
<i>Why aren't you answering?
I order you to...</i>

02:17.121 --> 02:20.099
<i>Damn.</i>
He turned off the engine.

02:41.112 --> 02:44.966
- What the... Drive straight to the runway.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

02:52.682 --> 02:55.259
- Comrade colonel, the committee has arrived.
- Which committee!

02:55.359 --> 02:56.802
- General Kamanin.

03:02.275 --> 03:04.369
It's like he's blowing the engine.

03:05.803 --> 03:08.939
Come on, buddy.
Come on.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.071
There we go!

03:20.993 --> 03:22.620
Hold on!

03:31.629 --> 03:33.923
Lyoha... Lyoha!

03:52.566 --> 03:54.193
Markelov...

03:56.612 --> 03:58.114
Scallywag.

04:07.690 --> 04:11.327
Comrade Lieutenant General! The commander
of the 294th non integrated reconnoitring...

04:11.387 --> 04:12.538
At ease.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.733
And what are you doing here?

04:15.180 --> 04:18.950
Circus performance,
with visual effects?

04:19.051 --> 04:20.911
Lyosha, are you OK?

04:22.705 --> 04:25.983
Why you didn't jump?
We all almost turned grey!

04:28.277 --> 04:30.896
Here, hide it.

04:33.382 --> 04:36.844
And what will we say?
Eh, Lyosha?

04:36.944 --> 04:41.065
Well, uh, uh... We'll say we were saving
expensive Soviet equipment.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.582
Come on!

04:45.578 --> 04:48.230
The equipment isn't new.
The engine went wack.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.458
But we'll deal with it
and find whose fault that is.

04:50.700 --> 04:51.943
Who is the pilot?

04:52.969 --> 04:54.604
Lieutenant Leonov.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.589
There will be a special talk with him.

04:56.689 --> 04:58.682
Honestly, he's crazy.

05:02.961 --> 05:04.772
Send him to me.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.800
We're just looking for ones.

07:33.662 --> 07:37.724
Experimental Construction Department No 1.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.281
In 1965!

08:22.711 --> 08:25.214
In 1965.

08:27.149 --> 08:29.343
You all free.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.472
I said, you are free.

08:41.246 --> 08:43.816
How so, in 1965?

08:44.850 --> 08:46.585
Why?

08:46.902 --> 08:50.572
It was supposed to be in 1967.

08:51.006 --> 08:55.769
By that year, Voskhod 2
could be prepared 100%. Why?

08:55.870 --> 08:59.274
Because the Americans
have moved their flight.

08:59.473 --> 09:03.360
Now they are planning
their spacewalk before us.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.421
<i>It's unacceptable.</i>

09:05.671 --> 09:08.532
But to allow an unprepared product
into space...

09:08.632 --> 09:13.053
...with "USSR" letters on its side
is acceptable?

09:13.153 --> 09:16.181
To fall flat on our face
in front of the whole world is acceptable?

09:16.281 --> 09:21.795
And get to heroic corpses instead of
two alive heroes and cosmonauts!

09:21.895 --> 09:24.923
We'll prepare the spacecraft
as carefully as we can.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.275
But the period of time is too short.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.318
Two spacecrafts.

09:28.861 --> 09:31.096
The first one is a test.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.192
We'll work over all our mistakes on it.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.963
And then... our Voskhod 2 will fly.
Thank God...

09:39.063 --> 09:41.950
<i>...we have the two best pilots.</i>

10:10.360 --> 10:13.840
How many combat missions
did you have on the front?

10:15.199 --> 10:16.658
Stop bugging me, Lyosha.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.145
We're approaching
the disembarking point.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.693
The ceiling is really low.
And the wind is increasing.

10:26.084 --> 10:29.013
<i>- How low?
- Ceiling is 1300 feet, without light gaps.</i>

10:29.113 --> 10:32.158
<i>The wind is 12 points, gusty.</i>
Are we going back?

10:32.620 --> 10:34.113
We are.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.546
Why?
It's fun with the wind.

10:37.202 --> 10:40.507
With such a wind, it would be fun
if out of ten times...

10:40.651 --> 10:42.651
...at least one was without consequence.
Take it!

10:46.171 --> 10:48.574
Will we back off in space too?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.977
There will be different instructions
in space, Lyosha.

10:52.177 --> 10:54.622
What did they choose us for?

10:54.872 --> 10:57.324
Why us, why not someone else?

10:57.833 --> 11:00.845
I haven't thought about that yet.

11:00.945 --> 11:04.156
To handle impossible tasks.

11:05.341 --> 11:07.426
Eat, the apple is tasty.

11:14.950 --> 11:16.485
I'll eat at home.

11:19.204 --> 11:21.323
Lyosha, you didn't get it?
We aren't jumping now.

11:21.423 --> 11:23.834
- Who's to say?
- The instructions.

11:26.595 --> 11:28.530
Don't get bored, chap.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.017
Vlad!

11:32.117 --> 11:33.494
Close!

12:17.613 --> 12:19.648
Stay calm, Pasha.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.166
Unwind!

12:29.517 --> 12:31.627
Unwind!

12:32.502 --> 12:34.379
Feet together!

12:36.056 --> 12:38.974
- What?
- Feet together!

13:01.823 --> 13:03.533
Come along.

13:10.499 --> 13:11.875
Come on.

13:12.084 --> 13:13.460
Lyoshka!

13:22.678 --> 13:23.937
<i>Don't touch.</i>

13:24.137 --> 13:27.149
<i>The bird won't come back
if it knows that you touched them.</i>

13:27.349 --> 13:28.859
Is it its house?

13:28.959 --> 13:31.218
- It is.
- And it also sleeps here?

13:31.278 --> 13:32.429
Who knows.

13:32.529 --> 13:35.616
But dad, tell me,
where does the bird sleep?

13:35.716 --> 13:39.269
If you want to know,
you'll find out. Come!

13:41.947 --> 13:43.223
<i>Lyoshka!</i>

13:43.323 --> 13:44.700
<i>Let's go.</i>

13:56.135 --> 13:59.239
The meaning is correct,
but the form is not.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.450
There is a lack of formal tone.

14:01.550 --> 14:03.327
- Comrade general, permission to speak?
- No.

14:03.427 --> 14:04.912
I'm sorry, may I ask...

14:05.012 --> 14:07.998
Give a decree, so they let me visit
lieutenant colonel Belyaev.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.867
- The doctors will decide.
- They have already decided.

14:09.967 --> 14:12.361
But he doesn't want to see anyone.
He's upset.

14:12.461 --> 14:14.446
I want to maintain
my comrade's morale, please.

14:14.546 --> 14:18.392
- What's with your leg?
- Oh, it just fell asleep.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.102
Leonov.

14:20.602 --> 14:23.639
Do you know why I didn't give you
a kick in the pants yet?

14:23.739 --> 14:25.057
Negative, sir.

14:25.257 --> 14:26.792
Neither do I.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.061
- Continue the training activity.
- Thank you.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.188
Comrade general, we'll do it!

14:31.288 --> 14:33.340
Pavel will leave the hospital,
and you'll see...

14:33.440 --> 14:37.278
<i>- Major Khrunov is your new partner.</i>
- How so? What abut Pavel?

14:37.678 --> 14:40.822
Please, listen! That's not his fault, honestly.
I jumped first, you understand.

14:40.922 --> 14:44.626
- I provoked him.
- I know, I read it in your report.

14:45.280 --> 14:49.859
Don't worry. Belyaev will rest for a while,
get some treatment.

14:49.981 --> 14:52.668
The officer isn't young, almost forty.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.127
Let him regain his health.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.322
But we have no right
to slow down the program.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.342
You are training with Khrunov for now.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.860
Yes, sir.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.016
The dinner is getting cold.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.444
Looks like it.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.272
Sveta, I've already told you,
that "looks like it"...

15:30.372 --> 15:31.957
...is the worst compliment
for an artist.

15:32.057 --> 15:36.086
It's not a compliment for an artist,
but it's for a cosmonaut with a paintbrush.

15:36.586 --> 15:39.189
Who, by the way, could have become
a very good artist.

15:39.289 --> 15:42.359
Please, you're blocking my light.
But what about space?

15:43.151 --> 15:46.179
For a real artist,
in order to get into space...

15:46.679 --> 15:49.491
...it's not necessary
to fly there on a rocket.

15:49.825 --> 15:52.619
But I see the stars throught the ceiling.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.963
No, it's rather...

15:55.122 --> 15:59.326
I don't see the ceiling,
but only the sky.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.380
I would reach the Moon on a bike.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.907
But there are not such bikes.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.351
Dinner is ready!

16:07.451 --> 16:10.560
- Daddy, may I take the apple?
- Hey, after dinner.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.149
So let's go have dinner now.

16:43.295 --> 16:44.897
Hi!

16:50.468 --> 16:52.337
Well, I see.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.564
Right, keep silent.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.267
I will speak.

16:57.501 --> 16:59.069
So...

16:59.569 --> 17:04.808
We start the program
to restore physical form.

17:05.008 --> 17:07.277
I have just one life.

17:08.111 --> 17:11.431
And just one workmate too.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.340
I won't fly with others.

17:14.142 --> 17:17.546
Of course, I'm training with Khrunov now,
but that's to keep the trainings going.

17:17.646 --> 17:21.273
And as soon as you're back,
we go to the supervisors.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.886
And file a report for the medical board,
and everything will be fine.

17:25.369 --> 17:27.906
That's good that you don't have
a fracture, right?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.149
That's really good!

17:29.249 --> 17:31.360
An old injury got worse, but that's it.

17:31.460 --> 17:34.229
That's such a trifle,
that's "off", it'll heal up.

17:34.329 --> 17:36.657
Some people get their head split open.
But you got the leg.

17:36.757 --> 17:40.802
Alexey, look at me and hear me.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.466
I will fly with you nowhere.

17:43.488 --> 17:45.624
And why do I disgust you so much?

17:46.675 --> 17:48.393
That's not it.

17:48.827 --> 17:51.529
You have no fear, and that's bad.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.046
Hey, I'll tell you a story
from my childhood.

17:59.146 --> 18:02.315
- Go away!
- And you'll understand what I'm talking about.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.308
You didn't understand me?

18:03.408 --> 18:05.719
Don't be ridiculous.
Leonov doesn't leave just like that?

18:05.819 --> 18:08.163
I'll do my work now and then leave.

18:12.617 --> 18:14.369
Easy, easy.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.397
OK. Swing.

18:20.542 --> 18:23.853
And one, two..

18:24.229 --> 18:25.563
One!

18:27.082 --> 18:28.358
Two...

18:31.194 --> 18:35.270
- Let me help! Painful?
- Ah! Get a hell out of here!

18:35.599 --> 18:37.243
What happened, comrade Belyaev?

18:37.343 --> 18:39.144
<i>Go away from here!</i>

18:40.446 --> 18:43.090
Everything is fine, we figured it out.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.551
- Go away!
- OK.

18:57.180 --> 18:59.208
What's there?
Do you want me to scratch?

19:00.185 --> 19:01.953
You scratch yourself.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.652
In an hour.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.873
Why, during all those
zero-gravity sessions, didn't you have...

19:54.100 --> 19:57.887
...any successful attempts
of entry into the airlock?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.777
<i>What is the hindrance, comrade major?</i>

19:59.867 --> 20:04.514
Well, there are actually a number of reasons.
One of them is... the spacesuit.

20:05.054 --> 20:07.232
<i>Comrade chief designer calls it "Eagle"...</i>

20:07.332 --> 20:09.784
...but it's rather an asbestos coffin.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.229
Sorry.
But I have a suggestion. Can I?

20:14.063 --> 20:15.482
Boris Victorovich!

20:16.149 --> 20:20.087
So, in order to pull up the tether
and control your movements...

20:20.187 --> 20:23.206
...you need more agility.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.792
Here, please, note linkage joints...

20:25.892 --> 20:30.896
...at the elbow, knee, carpal bends
for greater freedom of movement.

20:30.972 --> 20:32.808
- Did you draw it yourself?
- Yes, sir.

20:32.908 --> 20:35.593
They correlate with the total pressure
in the spacesuit...

20:35.693 --> 20:42.834
Boys, making a spacesuit like that
will take two or... two and a half years.

20:42.934 --> 20:44.745
We don't have such time,
comrade Leonov.

20:44.845 --> 20:46.704
- I see, Sergey Pavlovich.
- But what if...

20:46.904 --> 20:50.692
...we shift the tether attachment point
to the helmet.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.268
Excuse me, what?

20:53.044 --> 20:54.321
Why?

20:54.979 --> 20:58.950
Our cosmonaut enters the airlock
feet first, right?

20:59.050 --> 21:02.520
I feel, it would be better,
if the cosmonaut can see where he is going...

21:02.620 --> 21:04.890
...and get into the airlock head first.

21:10.170 --> 21:12.881
Comrades, leave us for three minutes.

21:15.123 --> 21:16.166
Go ahead.

21:16.176 --> 21:17.610
- Me?
- Yes.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.155
How exactly do you want?

21:20.555 --> 21:22.849
Head first?
Please, show us.

21:24.976 --> 21:26.353
Come on.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.316
<i>Well?</i>

21:31.499 --> 21:35.362
And now turn back to face the hatch.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.363
Why?

21:36.366 --> 21:38.534
In order to close the outer hatch.

21:38.782 --> 21:40.283
Manually.

21:40.286 --> 21:44.388
- But it's automatic.
- It's automatic 9 times of 10.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.873
Let's assume you are out of luck.

21:48.666 --> 21:53.246
<i>And now imagine,
that you are in an inflexible spacesuit.</i>

21:53.797 --> 21:56.249
And oxygen is running out.

21:57.634 --> 21:59.844
- Have you imagined?
- Yes.

21:59.904 --> 22:01.915
That's all, you're dead.

22:02.075 --> 22:03.910
<i>And your mate too.</i>

22:03.990 --> 22:07.767
Now we know, Sergey Pavlovich.
We'll be working on the running task.

22:07.852 --> 22:09.296
And sorry for bothering you

22:09.396 --> 22:10.855
Sergey Pavlovich.

22:12.315 --> 22:15.119
We are ready to fly
even in shackles, even in mail.

22:15.169 --> 22:18.630
We're already people,
who fly in shackles from birth.

22:19.489 --> 22:22.309
But imagine, if they were removed.

22:22.659 --> 22:24.202
What would happen?

22:27.497 --> 22:33.168
We'd lose balance and crash.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.880
That's who we are.

22:37.048 --> 22:38.241
Go.

22:38.341 --> 22:40.417
Yes, sir.

22:40.885 --> 22:42.262
The drawing.

22:42.512 --> 22:43.972
<i>Leave it.</i>

23:04.200 --> 23:06.044
Yevgeny Anatolievich.

23:06.244 --> 23:08.104
Something's wrong with Belyaev!

23:08.204 --> 23:09.581
How?

23:23.720 --> 23:25.038
Comrade Belyaev.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.440
What are you doing?

23:30.894 --> 23:34.155
As you said, exercising the leg.

23:34.255 --> 23:36.674
But I meant little by little.

23:36.774 --> 23:39.052
Gradually, with time.

23:42.780 --> 23:46.175
I don't have time,
Evgeny Anatolievich.

23:54.417 --> 23:56.903
The old pilot amazes me.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.798
You know, what I like most
about you, Khrunov?

23:59.898 --> 24:00.798
What?

24:00.888 --> 24:02.290
Your smile.

24:02.717 --> 24:04.177
Smile again.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.388
What a smile!

24:19.567 --> 24:20.944
Pasha!

24:26.574 --> 24:28.159
Welcome back!

24:39.128 --> 24:41.130
Squad! Draw up!

24:41.506 --> 24:43.658
<i>Front leaning rest position!</i>

24:43.858 --> 24:44.993
I'm sorry.

24:45.093 --> 24:47.595
- Comrade Belyaev, join up
- Yes, sir

24:47.887 --> 24:49.664
- Welcome back!
- Thank you.

24:49.764 --> 24:52.041
<i>And one, two...</i>

25:16.533 --> 25:20.553
Experimental Construction Department No 1
120 days before launch

25:20.753 --> 25:22.188
<i>Nikishin!</i>

25:22.980 --> 25:24.315
<i>Nikishin!</i>

25:24.882 --> 25:27.427
It's time to go home
and get enough sleep.

25:27.677 --> 25:29.871
Finish tomorrow.

25:29.971 --> 25:32.540
Sergey Pavlovich, people need rest.

25:32.640 --> 25:36.628
They've been toiling
for three weeks three-shifts.

25:36.728 --> 25:39.631
Right after the visitation.

25:39.731 --> 25:41.090
Everyone will get a day off.

25:41.190 --> 25:42.425
One day.

25:42.525 --> 25:45.528
Maybe, let's put the chairman
of the committee in the spaceship.

25:45.820 --> 25:49.265
To feel like Gagarin and be content.

25:49.365 --> 25:52.602
Then to the celebration dinner
and a kick in the pants.

25:52.702 --> 25:55.188
A kick in the pants is OK.

25:55.288 --> 25:59.325
But no outsiders in the spaceship,
even Brezhnev.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.411
What is it? Nikishin?

26:10.511 --> 26:11.829
Step aside.

26:11.929 --> 26:14.440
Shine it on the chest and head area.

26:16.476 --> 26:17.810
What?

26:21.022 --> 26:22.173
Dead.

26:22.273 --> 26:23.650
My God.

26:24.150 --> 26:27.070
I want to know exactly what happened.

26:27.695 --> 26:28.780
Exactly.

26:28.880 --> 26:33.685
Boris Evseevich, report back to me
in half an hour what occurred...

26:33.885 --> 26:35.428
...with the electrics.

26:35.628 --> 26:36.871
Yes, sir.

26:37.497 --> 26:39.482
I take it that the visitation is cancelled?

26:39.582 --> 26:42.402
No way!
I want them to see all this.

26:42.502 --> 26:45.029
<i>We desperately need them to see it.</i>

26:45.129 --> 26:48.174
May they report back
to whom they should.

26:56.023 --> 26:58.835
The beginning was better,
comrade colonel.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.054
Just a moment.

27:02.230 --> 27:04.090
Please, give it to Svetlana Egorovna.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.718
- Yes, sure.
- In honour of a nice sunny day.

27:06.818 --> 27:09.237
- OK.
- And her wise decision.

27:12.949 --> 27:15.785
- What is this?
- Someone asked to give it to you.

27:18.162 --> 27:19.847
Put it here.

27:24.752 --> 27:26.529
So, comrade colonel.

27:26.629 --> 27:28.740
<i>By now I don't have claim to you.</i>

27:28.840 --> 27:32.835
Let's change the workload,
and then we'll check the pressure.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.930
<i>Well, for our ladies!</i>

27:36.030 --> 27:38.090
Hooray!

27:39.492 --> 27:40.768
And...

27:41.500 --> 27:43.636
By the way, what do I call a lady
who is a cosmonaut?

27:43.746 --> 27:46.941
<i>Female cosmonaut or lady cosmonaut?</i>

27:49.218 --> 27:53.089
We've said already, "for ladies".

27:53.350 --> 27:55.644
How did it go
with the medical commission?

28:04.267 --> 28:05.752
What did they say?

28:06.169 --> 28:08.980
Didn't let me pass.
Their decision.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.507
Stop, wait a second.

28:12.216 --> 28:14.010
What do you mean, "decision"?

28:14.110 --> 28:15.887
What did they give as a reason?

28:16.262 --> 28:17.705
Anything specific?

28:17.805 --> 28:20.349
"No go. Age, injuries," they say.

28:21.476 --> 28:24.420
"You can't run well with a bum leg".

28:24.520 --> 28:25.855
I see.

28:26.147 --> 28:27.982
So you backed off?

28:28.858 --> 28:30.718
So who am I going to fly with now?

28:30.818 --> 28:32.153
You are my workmate

28:32.253 --> 28:34.889
- Why are you deserting me?
- Lyosha, what are you up to?

28:34.989 --> 28:36.824
Am I your workmate?

28:38.034 --> 28:39.494
There is your workmate.

28:51.939 --> 28:54.675
We don't serve our own whims,
but the common goal.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.761
The doctors are right,
I'm ill-suited for the task.

28:56.861 --> 28:59.831
I don't care about the doctors.
If I fly, it's only with you.

28:59.931 --> 29:01.441
Are you really going to run in space?

29:01.541 --> 29:03.810
The Chief Designer is coming!
Fall in!

29:05.728 --> 29:07.396
Ten-shun!

29:07.730 --> 29:09.599
Run or not.

29:09.899 --> 29:12.160
You can't outrun fate.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.679
Things didn't work out for me.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.665
Can't outrun?

29:19.075 --> 29:20.451
Lyosha!

29:25.790 --> 29:26.791
Lyosha!

29:27.099 --> 29:29.427
It seems we must conquer space
without them now.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.064
Are you out of your mind,
comrade major?

29:32.171 --> 29:34.549
Do you want to be thrown out
of the squad?

29:34.649 --> 29:37.176
Comrade general!
Permission to speak, sir?

29:38.511 --> 29:40.596
Did you want anything,
comrade Leonov?

29:40.696 --> 29:42.540
Did you see him running?
Did you?

29:42.640 --> 29:45.017
So he's able.
Not half able.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.813
<i>- That's all?</i>
- Yes. I mean yes, sir

29:48.855 --> 29:51.148
- You're free.
- Yes, sir.

29:53.442 --> 29:55.519
You're free.

30:01.382 --> 30:05.011
I'd like to see the results
of the medical commission.

30:14.789 --> 30:15.965
"Zero gravity"

30:50.750 --> 30:52.460
Almaz-2 in the airlock.

30:55.171 --> 30:56.881
Well done, Almaz.

31:01.344 --> 31:04.371
The day of the launch
of the unmanned test module

31:06.474 --> 31:08.209
<i>Well, comrades cosmonauts...</i>

31:08.309 --> 31:12.255
<i>...during the test operations,</i>
we'll make a film about your everyday life.

31:12.455 --> 31:14.315
I feel myself Muslim Magomayev.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.790
It's good that not Edita Pyekha.

31:15.805 --> 31:17.290
Scene 1, take 3

31:17.360 --> 31:22.073
Today we gathered here
not to celebrate victory...

31:22.406 --> 31:25.142
...but to verify...

31:25.242 --> 31:27.854
...the possibility of victory.

31:27.954 --> 31:31.807
- Attention, get ready and... start.
- Come to daddy.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.001
- Daddy! Ouch!
- Easy, easy.

31:34.005 --> 31:35.282
<i>Stop.</i>

31:36.754 --> 31:38.130
Let's go again.

31:39.882 --> 31:41.258
"Key to ignition".

31:42.218 --> 31:44.495
I had a bad dream.

31:44.595 --> 31:45.721
Hey, what a silly thing...

31:45.723 --> 31:48.357
<i>- Stop.</i>
- The launch of an unmanned module...

31:48.600 --> 31:50.602
...will be implemented today...

31:50.759 --> 31:53.963
...at 10:30 AM Moscow time.

31:54.063 --> 31:55.198
<i>"Record 2".</i>

31:55.248 --> 31:59.685
As you know, the ship will reach an orbit
for testing purposes.

31:59.735 --> 32:00.761
<i>"Key on drainage".</i>

32:00.861 --> 32:03.823
- Come on, Svet, people are here, really.
- That's OK.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.609
"The space farewell", part 2,
scene 3, take 1.

32:06.709 --> 32:10.162
Our task is to run
a full test of the machinery.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.014
"Ignition".

32:11.114 --> 32:15.067
All key parts of Voskhod 2,
including inflatable airlock...

32:15.167 --> 32:18.462
...will be understood to be fully tested...

32:18.896 --> 32:24.034
...once the unmanned module
returns to Earth.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.378
"Start".

32:26.087 --> 32:27.622
Dad!

32:29.098 --> 32:32.585
We must be sure about the accuracy
of our calculations...

32:32.685 --> 32:35.004
...before the launch
of the spacecraft with...

32:35.104 --> 32:39.842
...pilots-cosmonauts:
Pavel Belyaev and Alexey Leonov.

32:39.942 --> 32:41.419
<i>"The spacecraft has reached the orbit".</i>

32:41.519 --> 32:45.765
Our heroes,
who we pin a special mission...

32:45.865 --> 32:46.574
<i>"The airlock is open".</i>

32:46.674 --> 32:50.645
...will go outside the capsule
for the first time ever...

32:50.745 --> 32:54.023
...and have a spacewalk in outer space.

32:54.123 --> 32:56.133
"Conditional spacewalk
has been implemented".

32:56.233 --> 33:01.238
The success of this flight
will help us in reaching the moment...

33:01.530 --> 33:04.759
..when we can be with space as equals.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.328
Be like friends.

33:07.428 --> 33:08.763
Take heed!

33:12.892 --> 33:16.212
<i>"Attention! The connection
with the test module has been lost".</i>

33:16.312 --> 33:18.923
<i>"Repeat, the connection
with the test module has been lost".</i>

33:19.023 --> 33:22.234
<i>Confirm.
Observing the cloud of wreckage.</i>

33:40.628 --> 33:42.463
- Good to see you, Sergey Pavlovich.
- Good to see you.

33:42.563 --> 33:45.549
You are kindly requested.

33:46.383 --> 33:49.178
<i>"I pledge to the Soviet government...</i>

33:49.970 --> 33:52.515
<i>"...esteemed Communist Party...</i>

33:53.474 --> 33:54.750
<i>"...and all Soviet people".</i>

33:54.850 --> 33:56.293
Good to see you, Leonid Ilyich.

33:56.393 --> 33:58.129
Good evening, Sergey Pavlovich.

33:58.229 --> 34:00.856
Let's finish the movie and talk.

34:02.108 --> 34:05.111
I don't have time to watch a movie.

34:06.070 --> 34:09.565
I can feel Earth slipping under foot.

34:09.864 --> 34:14.487
It doesn't slip under foot,
only for those who make no headway.

34:14.687 --> 34:18.290
And you're Korolyov,
engine for progress.

34:21.460 --> 34:25.739
I have a complete report here
with all technical details.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.909
Let me try to tell you in short.

34:29.009 --> 34:31.161
If something isn't clear, ask.

34:31.262 --> 34:33.097
I know.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.466
The spacecraft reached the orbit.

34:36.225 --> 34:39.695
Conditional spacewalk was implemented.

34:40.020 --> 34:43.891
Now repeat the same.

34:44.500 --> 34:48.529
With two cosmonauts.
And get a Gold Star.

34:48.629 --> 34:52.658
But the spacecraft fell apart.
We don't know why. Don't have data.

34:52.668 --> 34:54.495
Was there a spacewalk?

34:55.844 --> 34:57.036
Conditionally, yes.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.748
Now, do it unconditionally.

35:00.166 --> 35:03.961
The United States
want to launch their spacecraft in May.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.781
Our Voskhod must fly before.

35:06.881 --> 35:08.365
So that the whole world knows...

35:08.465 --> 35:11.126
...that we are the first.

35:11.594 --> 35:15.539
Our space time is happening.
Soviet time.

35:15.639 --> 35:16.849
The time of pioneers.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.560
I don't care if the Americans
will launch first.

35:20.102 --> 35:23.047
I understand that the main thing for us,
for our country...

35:23.147 --> 35:25.224
...is not to fall flat on our face.

35:25.624 --> 35:26.901
But...

35:27.276 --> 35:29.311
...while I manage all this...

35:29.528 --> 35:32.306
...an unprepared spacecraft
won't go to space.

35:32.406 --> 35:35.392
All the more, if my people are inside.

35:35.492 --> 35:37.069
Only over my dead body.

35:37.169 --> 35:39.622
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

35:41.248 --> 35:42.583
You know what?

35:43.459 --> 35:45.586
Think over that.

35:45.961 --> 35:48.631
And get to work tomorrow.

35:48.839 --> 35:51.300
There is no one but you.

35:51.926 --> 35:54.345
Our indispensable.

36:19.110 --> 36:22.513
Cosmonaut's hotel. Baikonur.
One day before launch.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.661
I wonder, is it snowing in Moscow too?

36:35.761 --> 36:38.555
If so, if I can to ski with the girls.

36:39.056 --> 36:43.227
Yeah, right.
Build a snowman, get some pie.

36:43.652 --> 36:45.354
Did we prepare for nothing?

36:45.980 --> 36:48.524
Enjoy yourself if you want.

36:50.067 --> 36:51.986
We won't fly?

36:52.611 --> 36:54.889
I don't think anything.

36:54.989 --> 36:56.282
There is the regulation.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.100
We've spent so much time and effort.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.603
All sizzle, no steak.
But the regulation.

37:00.703 --> 37:02.229
What do they have for a head?

37:02.329 --> 37:03.439
What do you want?

37:03.539 --> 37:05.416
You want Korolyov to trust luck
and appoint the launch?

37:05.516 --> 37:08.569
Not luck, Pasha,
we took apart that ship.

37:08.669 --> 37:10.496
Cog by cog, and put it back together.

37:10.596 --> 37:13.449
I have confidence in it
like in my own mother.

37:13.549 --> 37:15.951
But you're just standing and packing.

37:16.051 --> 37:17.386
Do you think you're the only one
who wants to fly to space?

37:17.486 --> 37:18.746
I want it as much as...

37:25.769 --> 37:27.104
OK, well...

37:27.396 --> 37:29.089
As Motherland will say...

37:29.189 --> 37:31.650
Do I need your orders?

37:33.986 --> 37:35.571
I won't back off.

37:38.490 --> 37:39.825
Yes?

37:40.200 --> 37:43.495
- Good morning, Sergey Pavlovich.
- Good morning, comrade Chief Designer.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.164
Good morning.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.986
- You've been up for a while?
- No, just got up.

37:51.086 --> 37:52.421
Drinking tea.

37:53.881 --> 37:58.761
As you know, the test flight failed.

37:59.511 --> 38:04.250
Launching Voskhod 2 with people
is too risky.

38:04.350 --> 38:09.229
We'll repeatedly launch
an empty module on your rocket.

38:09.730 --> 38:12.258
We'll build a new one in a year.

38:12.358 --> 38:13.842
And you'll fly.

38:13.942 --> 38:15.302
Alright.

38:15.402 --> 38:18.764
Why are you upset?
The fact that the Americans will be the first?

38:18.864 --> 38:22.393
Sergey Pavlovich, we are in peak
of physical condition. We worked over...

38:22.493 --> 38:24.153
...three thousand emergency situations.

38:24.253 --> 38:27.956
There will be 3001st, 3002nd,
and 3003rd in space.

38:29.583 --> 38:32.444
I can't let you go, that's death.

38:32.544 --> 38:33.779
Eagles.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.214
Without an obituary.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.049
Why did you come then?

38:38.759 --> 38:40.202
You're a hillbilly.

38:40.302 --> 38:42.204
Yes, Listvyanka village.

38:42.304 --> 38:44.473
That's next to Kemerovo.

38:50.651 --> 38:54.246
I could have died at three, when my father
had been taken away as "enemy of the people".

38:54.316 --> 38:57.136
And we were inked
as "family of saboteurs".

38:57.336 --> 38:59.613
The neighbours raided at once.

38:59.743 --> 39:03.004
Took food at first,
the furniture, then house.

39:05.527 --> 39:08.021
Put us out on the street in the frost.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.522
Mom was pregnant.

39:10.599 --> 39:12.342
And we, eight kids.

39:13.352 --> 39:16.880
The neighbour came back,
took off my outerwear, I stayed like that.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.757
In a long shirt.

39:20.105 --> 39:22.825
Thank God, the older sister
with her husband sheltered us.

39:22.925 --> 39:24.743
A room in a dormitory for workers.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.090
170 square feet for all.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.685
My place was just under the bed.

39:30.144 --> 39:32.729
But so what, we survived.

39:33.105 --> 39:34.398
Then the war.

39:34.498 --> 39:36.333
All men to the front.

39:38.083 --> 39:42.070
The rest to mobile hospitals,
to recreate the industry, defense.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.741
And to study.
My mom brought me to school, I had a look...

39:44.841 --> 39:48.245
I'm proud, standing.
She looked at my feet.

39:48.345 --> 39:51.540
The ice melted into puddles.
I didn't have shoes.

39:52.416 --> 39:55.269
But so what, we withstood,
we survived.

39:55.669 --> 39:59.998
Then the Victory, yes. But at what price.
All uncles, brothers were dead.

40:00.924 --> 40:03.343
And the whole country like that,
every family.

40:03.483 --> 40:04.901
Sergey Pavlovich.

40:05.262 --> 40:07.264
We went through that.

40:08.056 --> 40:10.058
We only have so much left.

40:11.310 --> 40:14.646
Not to get scared
of an emergency situation.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.816
I'll gnaw through a hole
in the hatch and go out.

40:24.490 --> 40:25.949
Sergey Pavlovich.

40:27.367 --> 40:29.236
We are ready to take a risk.

40:59.566 --> 41:01.818
Strong tea.

42:56.701 --> 42:58.178
See you later.

43:05.008 --> 43:06.301
Attention!

43:22.826 --> 43:24.227
Comrade general!

43:24.327 --> 43:25.328
We are ready for launch.

43:25.428 --> 43:28.315
Report back to comrade Brezhnev
and comrade Kosygin.

43:28.415 --> 43:32.360
That spaceship Voskhod 2
is ready for launch.

43:32.460 --> 43:33.795
Yes, sir.

43:34.963 --> 43:36.798
Zarya, this is Almaz, we are ready.

43:40.343 --> 43:42.429
Attention!
We are one minute to launch.

43:43.338 --> 43:44.773
<i>Key to ignition.</i>

43:45.199 --> 43:46.300
Key to ignition go.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.634
<i>Venting.</i>

43:48.110 --> 43:49.361
<i>Venting go.</i>

43:49.561 --> 43:50.837
<i>Key on drainage.</i>

43:51.413 --> 43:52.973
<i>Key on drainage go.</i>

43:53.073 --> 43:54.449

44:01.690 --> 44:03.066
<i>Intermediate go.</i>

44:03.175 --> 44:04.751
<i>Main stage.</i>

44:05.227 --> 44:06.920
Main stage go.

44:07.254 --> 44:08.630
<i>Start.</i>

44:10.772 --> 44:12.115
<i>Start go.</i>

44:12.275 --> 44:13.552
Good luck.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.203
Eagles.

44:15.303 --> 44:16.438
<i>Lift off.</i>

44:16.638 --> 44:18.665
<i>Lift off contact confirmed.</i>

44:24.304 --> 44:26.898
<i>All systems work well.</i>

44:32.329 --> 44:33.905
<i>25.</i>

44:34.906 --> 44:36.241
<i>30.</i>

44:36.491 --> 44:39.511

are good.</i>

44:48.628 --> 44:49.963

44:56.536 --> 44:57.971
<i>60.</i>

44:58.513 --> 45:01.715
<i>Pitch, yaw, roll are all good.</i>

45:05.380 --> 45:06.715
<i>70.</i>

45:08.690 --> 45:10.384
<i>The flight is going well.</i>

45:10.484 --> 45:15.062
<i>Attention!
This is Moscow broadcast.</i>

45:15.300 --> 45:18.353
<i>We are broadcasting across
all radio stations...</i>

45:18.430 --> 45:23.767
<i>...and the Central Television
of the Soviet Union.</i>

45:23.867 --> 45:25.767
<i>Wszystkie elementy steruj¹ce

<i>...at 10 AM, artificial satellite
and spaceship Voskhod 2...</i>

45:36.676 --> 45:43.887
<i>...was placed in the orbit
of planet Earth.</i>

45:44.142 --> 45:50.979
<i>With the ship continuously maintaining
radio contact...</i>

45:51.149 --> 45:54.386
<i>...comrades Belyaev and Leonov
are carrying out their work...</i>

45:54.486 --> 45:58.713
<i>...in accordance with the flight program.</i>

46:00.784 --> 46:02.619
Zarya, this is Almaz.

46:02.869 --> 46:05.021
Slight vibration.

46:05.121 --> 46:07.707
All devices are working normally.

46:08.575 --> 46:10.569
Feeling excellent.

46:10.669 --> 46:13.613
<i>We stand ready to implement the task.</i>

46:13.713 --> 46:16.491
Almaz, start to implement the task.

46:16.591 --> 46:18.410
Copy, Zarya.

46:18.510 --> 46:20.428
Elongating the airlock.

46:47.530 --> 46:52.318
Zarya, the airlock has been elongated.
We're starting to equalize the pressure in the airlock.

46:55.522 --> 46:59.092
<i>Zarya, getting ready to enter the airlock.</i>

47:15.191 --> 47:17.886
<i>Zarya, the airlock pressure
has been equalized.</i>

47:17.986 --> 47:20.989
Switching to the oxygen supply
from the backpack.

47:32.459 --> 47:36.671
Zarya, the spacesuit is pressure-tight.
Opening the inner hatch of the airlock.

47:48.433 --> 47:49.976
Don't get bored.

47:51.144 --> 47:52.520
I'll be back soon.

47:58.068 --> 48:00.487
Pasha, push me.
Just a little bit.

48:08.161 --> 48:09.996
This is Almaz-2.

48:10.622 --> 48:12.399
I'm in the airlock.

48:12.499 --> 48:14.626
<i>Almaz-2, copy.</i>

48:15.126 --> 48:19.214
Zarya, this is Almaz.
Closing the inner hatch of the airlock.

48:26.680 --> 48:29.808
<i>Zarya, this is Almaz.
Starting to depressurize the airlock.</i>

48:32.852 --> 48:36.272
Almaz-2, pressure-relief in the airlock
is 5 minutes.

48:39.442 --> 48:42.037
<i>Pressure is elevated, but within range.</i>

48:55.183 --> 48:58.545
<i>Almaz-2, your oxygen consumption
is above normal.</i>

48:58.937 --> 49:00.788
Lyosha, breath evenly.

49:03.008 --> 49:04.992
I'm almost not breathing.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.688
<i>Attention, get ready.</i>

49:10.603 --> 49:13.256
Zarya, the airlock pressure is zero.

49:14.436 --> 49:17.564
Opening the outer hatch of the airlock.

49:23.862 --> 49:26.306
<i>Almaz-2, give a status report.</i>

49:26.406 --> 49:29.492
This is Almaz-2, reporting.

49:29.826 --> 49:31.619
Everything is going well.

49:32.787 --> 49:35.682
<i>Ready to go outside the ship.</i>

49:39.419 --> 49:43.622
Begin moving into outer space.

49:44.716 --> 49:46.051
<i>Copy that.</i>

49:46.468 --> 49:48.219
Almaz-2.

49:48.470 --> 49:50.288
Moving into outer space...

49:50.388 --> 49:51.848
...is permitted.

49:55.310 --> 49:57.295
<i>Lyosha, make two trips.</i>

49:57.395 --> 49:59.522
<i>The first is for testing, with loads.</i>

49:59.731 --> 50:01.858
<i>The second one, for taking photos.</i>

50:02.275 --> 50:03.777
Copy, Almaz.

50:54.619 --> 50:56.204
Zarya.

50:57.247 --> 50:59.290
This is Almaz-2.

51:01.126 --> 51:04.921
I'm on the edge of the airlock.

51:05.505 --> 51:07.198
Feeling...

51:07.298 --> 51:08.925
...excellent!

51:09.509 --> 51:12.679
I see clouds, the sea below.

51:14.264 --> 51:15.665
Caucasus range.

51:15.765 --> 51:17.892
Right now! Just passed.

51:20.228 --> 51:22.338
I see sky.

51:22.438 --> 51:24.340
I see land.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.609
Volga! Right below.

51:28.903 --> 51:32.114
<i>Good working conditions!</i>

51:34.075 --> 51:36.978
Almaz-2, get ready for departure.

51:37.078 --> 51:38.788
Yes, copy that.

52:06.316 --> 52:09.027
Remove the lens cap from the camera.

52:17.744 --> 52:20.121
I've removed it.
I've removed the lens cap.

52:20.788 --> 52:22.265
Where can I put it?

52:22.707 --> 52:24.125
Where?

52:27.086 --> 52:28.404
Just throw it away.

52:28.504 --> 52:29.572
<i>Copy.</i>

52:29.672 --> 52:31.132
Throwing away.

52:35.220 --> 52:36.930
Zarya, this is Almaz-2.

52:37.138 --> 52:38.932
Pulling out the tether.

52:44.145 --> 52:50.225
<i>Soviet Cosmovision
is sharing another broadcast from space.</i>

52:50.401 --> 52:53.446
<i>From the Voskhod 2 spaceship.</i>

52:53.905 --> 52:56.758
<i>We are witnessing the event...</i>

52:56.908 --> 53:00.912
<i>...that just yesterday
we spoke of only as fantasy.</i>

53:04.707 --> 53:06.084
Almaz-2.

53:07.001 --> 53:08.586
Begin push off.

53:42.620 --> 53:45.456
<i>Almaz-2, you can depart.</i>

53:45.748 --> 53:48.126
OK, OK, wait a sec.

54:03.349 --> 54:04.934
Well, I'm off.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.768
<i>Zvezda, Zarya!</i>

54:20.908 --> 54:22.368
<i>This is Almaz.</i>

54:22.994 --> 54:27.048
Man went into outer space.

54:28.583 --> 54:33.171
<i>Man went into outer space.</i>

54:35.748 --> 54:39.202
He's now in free flight.

54:39.302 --> 54:45.099
<i>Today, March 18th, 1965...</i>

54:45.160 --> 54:49.314
<i>...at 11:35 AM Moscow time...</i>

54:49.370 --> 54:53.973
<i>...during the flight of spaceship Voskhod 2...</i>

54:54.057 --> 54:59.297
<i>...the first ever spacewalk has been implemented.
The first man has gone...</i>

54:59.489 --> 55:03.334
...into outer space.

55:03.502 --> 55:05.580
On the second orbit of the flight...

55:05.660 --> 55:11.374
...the second pilot, cosmonaut Major
<i>Leonov Alexey Arkhipovich...</i>

55:11.534 --> 55:13.336
<i>...in a special spacesuit...</i>

55:13.536 --> 55:16.364
<i>...with an autonomous life support system...</i>

55:16.564 --> 55:18.849
<i>...went into...</i>

55:19.217 --> 55:23.020
<i>...outer space.</i>

55:24.560 --> 55:29.787
Dad is a real cosmonaut!
Real!

55:30.453 --> 55:32.714
So, now we only need to learn docking.

55:32.814 --> 55:35.708
And then we can form space forces.

55:35.808 --> 55:38.344
Great job!
Everyone did well!

55:38.585 --> 55:40.620
<i>Stay focused!</i>

56:06.681 --> 56:07.890
Comrade general.

56:08.020 --> 56:09.280
The Kremlin is on the line.

56:09.550 --> 56:11.586
They ask to connect directly
with the cosmonaut.

56:11.766 --> 56:13.209
Well, then connect them.

56:13.289 --> 56:14.974
- Put them through.
- Yes, sir.

56:35.284 --> 56:36.210
<i>Lyosha?</i>

56:36.310 --> 56:37.570
Yes?

56:37.670 --> 56:38.880
<i>Lyosha?</i>

Yes?

56:40.639 --> 56:41.974
Who is this?

56:42.541 --> 56:44.769
<i>Brezhnev is on the line.</i>

56:44.942 --> 56:46.802
Leonid Ilyich?

56:47.430 --> 56:49.724
<i>- How are you doing, son?</i>
- Reporting.

56:50.274 --> 56:53.711
My mind is clear,
my vision is not disturbed.

56:53.941 --> 56:56.093
Spatial orientation is normal.

56:56.606 --> 57:01.277
Man can work in outer space.

57:01.944 --> 57:03.905
Man can work...

57:04.614 --> 57:06.357
...in outer space.

57:06.425 --> 57:09.487
<i>I see how you're tumbling
around out there.</i>

57:09.619 --> 57:11.896
<i>The whole country is watching you.</i>

57:11.996 --> 57:13.289
<i>And the whole world.</i>

57:13.389 --> 57:15.682
- Thank you.
<i>- We are proud of you.</i>

57:15.833 --> 57:16.901
Thanks.
Really thank you.

57:17.001 --> 57:20.363
<i>You come back alive, above all.</i>

57:20.463 --> 57:22.949
<i>That's an order, do you hear me?</i>

57:23.049 --> 57:26.786
<i>Proud to serve the Soviet Union.</i>

57:26.986 --> 57:28.663
What are his parameters?

57:28.863 --> 57:33.059
Pressure and temperature
slightly going up, but in general...

57:33.893 --> 57:35.795
All parameters are good.

57:35.895 --> 57:36.938
The air?

57:37.038 --> 57:38.714
The air lasts 27 minutes.

57:38.814 --> 57:40.983
Let's move to the next step.

57:43.444 --> 57:45.020
<i>Almaz-2.</i>

57:45.321 --> 57:48.884
Get ready for push off to test
the reaction of vestibular apparatus...

57:48.984 --> 57:51.727
<i>...for the position of the body in space.</i>

57:52.328 --> 57:53.863
Let's do it.

58:12.965 --> 58:14.792
Almaz-2, how do you feel?

58:14.932 --> 58:17.768
<i>Excellent.</i>

58:18.320 --> 58:23.417
Ready for the last stage for pictures.

58:23.542 --> 58:27.354
His pressure rose to 140 over 90.
Pulse...

58:27.546 --> 58:29.840
<i>...125, temperature 98 F.</i>

58:29.940 --> 58:31.400
He's worried.

58:31.842 --> 58:32.868
Who wouldn't be?

58:32.968 --> 58:34.312
Almaz-2.

58:34.612 --> 58:37.223
Take a couple of photos
and go back home.

58:37.273 --> 58:39.358
But without sudden movements.

58:39.550 --> 58:42.770
<i>- Slowly.</i>
- That's affirmative.

58:49.376 --> 58:50.711
Pasha!

58:51.120 --> 58:53.155
Are you smiling there?

58:54.089 --> 58:55.366
I am.

58:57.034 --> 58:58.169
I'm taking pictures.

58:58.269 --> 59:01.772
<i>Time is short. Take the photos
and come back, Lyosha.</i>

59:05.543 --> 59:06.919
Oh, wait.

59:07.169 --> 59:08.429
What's this?

59:08.529 --> 59:10.072
What's with the pressure?

59:13.117 --> 59:14.660
What's with the pressure?

59:36.031 --> 59:38.351
Almaz-2, are you OK?

59:39.520 --> 59:41.981
<i>Almaz, what's going on there?</i>

59:44.190 --> 59:46.133
<i>Almaz-2 is not replying.</i>

59:46.484 --> 59:48.336
<i>There was a knock
on the spaceship hull.</i>

59:48.400 --> 59:51.420
<i>Visual contact with Almaz-2 was lost.</i>

59:52.073 --> 59:53.658
What's with the connection?

59:55.159 --> 59:56.986
All devices work well.

59:57.086 --> 59:58.746
Technically, the connection isn't broken.

59:58.846 --> 01:00:01.774
- What are his parameters?
- Pressure, pulse, temperature...

01:00:01.874 --> 01:00:03.209
...all are rising.

01:00:09.048 --> 01:00:11.826
<i>Almaz, continue calling Almaz-2.</i>

01:00:11.885 --> 01:00:15.371
<i>Repeat, Almaz, continue calling Almaz-2.</i>

01:00:15.471 --> 01:00:17.498
Everything went too well,
too seamlessly.

01:00:17.598 --> 01:00:19.709
Stop all on-air broadcasts.

01:00:19.809 --> 01:00:20.985
Yes, sir.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.382
<i>We are presenting to the audience the
ballet of Sergey Sergeyevich Prokofiev...</i>

01:00:26.482 --> 01:00:27.876
<i>..."The Tale of the Stone Flower"...</i>

01:00:27.976 --> 01:00:34.013
<i>...on the stage of the State
Academic Bolshoi Theatre.</i>

01:00:47.753 --> 01:00:49.130
We'll wait.

01:00:58.107 --> 01:01:01.927
<i>Almaz-2, do you read me, over?</i>

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:10.192
Almaz-2, over?

01:01:11.736 --> 01:01:15.014
<i>Zarya, cannot connect with Almaz-2.</i>

01:01:15.114 --> 01:01:17.099
<i>Continue trying.</i>

01:01:17.199 --> 01:01:18.476
Sergey Pavlovich.

01:01:18.576 --> 01:01:21.228
There are certain instructions
for this situation.

01:01:21.328 --> 01:01:24.690
If Almaz-2 cannot get back to the ship...

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:27.568
...we have to get ready
to blow-off the airlock.

01:01:27.668 --> 01:01:30.071
Pressure 155 over 100.

01:01:30.171 --> 01:01:33.924
Pulse 150, temperature 101 F.

01:02:18.385 --> 01:02:20.454
Zarya, this is Almaz.

01:02:20.554 --> 01:02:23.182
Permission to go out to the airlock?

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:30.131
How long to the dead zone?

01:02:30.231 --> 01:02:31.758
It's about 5 minutes
until conection is lost.

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.381
Sergey Pavlovich,
the exit of the second cosmonaut...

01:02:34.465 --> 01:02:37.292
...means full depressurizing of the ship.

01:02:37.446 --> 01:02:40.490
And they will have to come back
by themselves. There won't be any connection.

01:02:40.535 --> 01:02:43.779
And how will the ship behave
after the depressurization...

01:02:43.869 --> 01:02:44.979
...only God knows

01:02:45.079 --> 01:02:46.856
Start praying then.

01:02:46.956 --> 01:02:47.873
Sergey Pavlovich.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:51.777
If we blow-off the airlock,
only one cosmonaut will die.

01:02:51.877 --> 01:02:55.197
If you give the order,
both could die.

01:02:55.297 --> 01:02:59.885
Almaz, get ready
to depressurize the ship.

01:03:02.137 --> 01:03:03.622
Copy, Zarya.

01:03:03.922 --> 01:03:05.933
<i>2 minutes. Standby.</i>

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:38.766
<i>If Belyaev cannot do it,
the results of the colossal work...</i>

01:03:38.866 --> 01:03:41.827
...of thousands of Soviet citizens
will stay in orbit.

01:03:41.927 --> 01:03:43.996
Now I think not about thousands,
but about two.

01:03:44.096 --> 01:03:45.831
<i>Zarya, this is Almaz.</i>

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.335
I'm ready to go to the airlock.

01:03:49.852 --> 01:03:50.912
Waiting for the order.

01:03:51.012 --> 01:03:54.256
We don't have any right
to fail the whole space program...

01:03:54.356 --> 01:03:55.525
...for one man.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:57.143
One minute until the dead zone.

01:03:57.243 --> 01:04:00.012
Cancel the command, Sergey Pavlovich.

01:04:00.112 --> 01:04:02.097
What are the parameters of Almaz-2.

01:04:02.197 --> 01:04:06.727
<i>Pressure 170 over 110, pulse 165.</i>

01:04:06.827 --> 01:04:08.738
<i>Temperature 102 F.</i>

01:04:09.371 --> 01:04:10.589
Alive.

01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:12.007
He's alive.

01:04:12.207 --> 01:04:13.200
Got it?

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.570
<i>Zarya, this is Almaz. Repeat,
ready to go out to the airlock.</i>

01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:18.005
Waiting for the order.

01:04:19.214 --> 01:04:21.826
I'm sure you know what you're doing.

01:04:21.926 --> 01:04:24.053
30 seconds until entering the dead zone.

01:04:31.477 --> 01:04:34.505
<i>Zarya, I repeat.</i>
Waiting for the command.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:37.049
Start depressurizing the ship.

01:04:37.149 --> 01:04:38.484
15.

01:04:41.403 --> 01:04:43.389
There he is! Almaz-2.
Next to the airlock!

01:04:43.489 --> 01:04:45.975
<i>Zarya, confirming!</i>
Almaz-2 is next to the airlock.

01:04:46.075 --> 01:04:47.909
Almaz-2! Damn it!

01:04:47.993 --> 01:04:49.453
Run home immediately!

01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.542
They are in the dead zone.

01:04:58.587 --> 01:04:59.655
What happened?

01:04:59.755 --> 01:05:01.148
<i>The spacesuit is inflating.</i>

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.111
<i>Arms, legs, fingers...
I can hardly move.</i>

01:05:04.259 --> 01:05:05.394
Why were you silent?

01:05:05.494 --> 01:05:07.171
Didn't want to bother you all.

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:08.768
<i>I see.</i>

01:05:08.889 --> 01:05:10.265
<i>OK.</i>

01:05:10.683 --> 01:05:13.644
<i>So, how much oxygen do I have?</i>

01:05:14.603 --> 01:05:15.938
A tad.

01:05:18.607 --> 01:05:20.084
<i>Lyosha, hurry up.</i>

01:05:21.694 --> 01:05:23.387
Lyosha, there's no time at all.

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:25.180
Take the camera
and get into the ship.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.391
OK, OK... Taking the camera, Pasha.

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.410
Go, go.

01:05:40.045 --> 01:05:41.422
Well done.

01:05:47.886 --> 01:05:49.304
<i>Hurry up.</i>

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:53.100
That's the only way.

01:05:59.698 --> 01:06:00.974
Come on!

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:02.718
What a mess.

01:06:02.818 --> 01:06:04.303
Try again!

01:06:04.403 --> 01:06:05.779
<i>Brace yourself!</i>

01:06:06.655 --> 01:06:07.781
<i>Stop!</i>
Belay!

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.492
Don't you dare!
<i>Only feet first!</i>

01:06:11.618 --> 01:06:12.853
Close.

01:06:12.953 --> 01:06:14.288
<i>Close!</i>

01:06:14.621 --> 01:06:16.498
<i>I said close!</i>

01:06:16.915 --> 01:06:18.250
<i>Do it!</i>

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:31.805
It hasn't closed, right?

01:06:32.056 --> 01:06:33.432
<i>No.</i>

01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:36.685
<i>I see.</i>

01:06:36.785 --> 01:06:40.281
<i>So, I have to turn around
and close it manually.</i>

01:06:40.381 --> 01:06:41.757
That won't work, Lyosha.

01:06:42.941 --> 01:06:44.651
But what are the other options?

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:46.862
I'll open the hatch.

01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:48.664
Pull you up.

01:06:48.764 --> 01:06:50.057
And you depressurize the ship.

01:06:50.157 --> 01:06:51.308
So, we'll take the risk.

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:53.452
<i>What?
To risk the whole operation?</i>

01:06:54.912 --> 01:06:56.271
No, Pasha.

01:06:56.371 --> 01:06:57.081
I'll try.

01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:58.058
<i>Lyosha!</i>

01:06:58.156 --> 01:06:59.708
Lyosha, no!

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:01.752
<i>Lyosha!</i>

01:07:03.337 --> 01:07:05.948
Stop!
<i>You only had a tiny bit of air.</i>

01:07:06.048 --> 01:07:07.967
Now you won't have anything at all.

01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:10.661
So, you can blow me off
together with the airlock.

01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:12.513
You're bull-headed!

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:28.153
Damn it.

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:29.221
I got stuck.

01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.514
I can't move.

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:33.392
Lyosha, talk less, save air.

01:07:33.492 --> 01:07:34.868
OK, I'm silent.

01:07:40.207 --> 01:07:42.860
And what if we put... The leg...

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.695
...like this!

01:07:44.795 --> 01:07:46.271
<i>Go, go!</i>

01:07:50.034 --> 01:07:51.510
Come on, Lyosha.

01:07:52.761 --> 01:07:54.138
Go, go, go.

01:07:59.134 --> 01:08:01.879
<i>Yes! The airlock is pressure-tight!
Well done!</i>

01:08:01.979 --> 01:08:03.297
<i>Now hold on.</i>

01:08:03.397 --> 01:08:05.899
<i>Hold on a couple of minutes
at the least.</i>

01:08:12.531 --> 01:08:13.282
<i>Lyosha.</i>

01:08:13.382 --> 01:08:14.658
<i>Lyosha, no!</i>

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:21.140
- That's all.
- What?

01:09:21.767 --> 01:09:23.727
My race is over.

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:27.231
Good job, Lyosha.

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.987
OK, I see, but can you tell us?

01:09:50.187 --> 01:09:52.798
I understand,
but what does it mean?

01:09:55.917 --> 01:09:57.094
Okay.

01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:58.845
Thanks.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.844
Well, they say that the flight
is going in normal mode.

01:10:06.444 --> 01:10:10.090
Lyosha always answers like that, when
someone disturbs him from work.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:12.000
Or when everything is bad.

01:10:22.369 --> 01:10:26.598
The demonstrations were held in honour
of the flight in Moscow and Leningrad.

01:10:28.883 --> 01:10:30.719
Svetlana Leonova called.

01:10:30.819 --> 01:10:32.629
<i>- Tea?</i>
- No, thank you.

01:10:33.297 --> 01:10:35.866
She asked what's what.
She's worried.

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:38.452
Why is she worried?
Anything happen? No.

01:10:38.552 --> 01:10:41.013
Voskhod 2 is going to emerge
from the dead zone in a minute.

01:10:41.113 --> 01:10:42.831
Start calling.

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:10.167
Lyosha?

01:11:13.003 --> 01:11:14.713
Lyosha, come back to Earth.

01:11:14.963 --> 01:11:16.298
Almaz-2.

01:11:16.715 --> 01:11:18.675
We are leaving the dead zone.

01:11:20.344 --> 01:11:22.220
Hey, I was thinking.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.556
Next time...

01:11:25.265 --> 01:11:26.350
...when we fly to the Moon...

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:28.226
Command Center is on the line.

01:11:28.602 --> 01:11:30.963
We' ll be getting a scolding now.

01:11:31.063 --> 01:11:35.200
<i>Almaz, this is Zarya.
Do you read me?</i>

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:38.320
Zarya, this is Almaz.
Reading you loud and clear.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.948
Almaz, what's with Almaz-2?

01:11:42.366 --> 01:11:44.810
Zarya, Almaz-2
reads you loud and clear too.

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.204
What a rascal.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:53.652
Almaz-2.

01:11:53.752 --> 01:11:55.320
<i>Welcome back.</i>

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.422
<i>Thank you for your service.</i>

01:12:00.425 --> 01:12:01.660
Thank you.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.078
Proud to serve to the Soviet...

01:12:03.178 --> 01:12:05.472
Why didn't you get in touch?

01:12:11.686 --> 01:12:13.839
Zarya, we had some problems
with the connection.

01:12:13.939 --> 01:12:15.590
We couldn't establish the reason why.

01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:16.800
<i>Almaz-2.</i>

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.094
<i>You can't answer for yourself?</i>

01:12:19.194 --> 01:12:20.554
I confirm.

01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:22.364
Zarya, everything is alright here.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.489
We are ready to blow-off the airlock.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.165
<i>Get ready.</i>

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.178
<i>Blow-off the airlock.</i>

01:12:28.278 --> 01:12:30.272
Getting ready to blow-off the airlock.

01:12:30.372 --> 01:12:34.401
<i>Almaz's, we need to remind you,
that we implemented the test cycle...</i>

01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:36.069
<i>...only until this stage.</i>

01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:40.073
<i>We don't know what can happen
after blowing off the airlock.</i>

01:12:40.173 --> 01:12:42.326
Be ready for everything.

01:12:42.526 --> 01:12:44.136
It can't get any worse.

01:12:45.762 --> 01:12:49.599
<i>Almaz, check the pressure in the cabin.</i>

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:51.511
The pressure in the cabin is normal.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.754
<i>Check the contact of the igniters.</i>

01:12:53.854 --> 01:12:56.565
There is contact.
Ready to blow-off the airlock.

01:12:58.525 --> 01:12:59.860
Blow-off.

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:17.997
Zarya, the blow-off is complete.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:21.381
Depressurizing or other faults
are not observed.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:23.383
But it spun.

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:28.622
How much has it spun?
Almaz?

01:13:28.722 --> 01:13:30.123
<i>Approximately...</i>

01:13:30.223 --> 01:13:32.250
<i>...20 degrees on the contour.</i>

01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:35.729
We can turn on the auto-orientation,
it will stabilize.

01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:39.341
And burn all the fuel
intended for a manual landing?

01:13:39.441 --> 01:13:42.803
Sergey Pavlovich, I can put my neck
on the line for the automation.

01:13:42.903 --> 01:13:45.346
The manual landing won't be needed.

01:13:48.783 --> 01:13:51.453
Almaz's, how do you feel?

01:13:52.871 --> 01:13:55.290
We feel good, Zarya.

01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:57.501
So...

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:00.862
Let's go for a spin?

01:14:00.962 --> 01:14:03.698
<i>It's 15 orbits before entering
the landing zone.</i>

01:14:03.798 --> 01:14:06.576
<i>It's about 22 hours.</i>

01:14:06.676 --> 01:14:08.862
<i>What do you think?
Will you endure it?</i>

01:14:09.221 --> 01:14:10.872
We will, Zarya.

01:14:10.972 --> 01:14:12.849
<i>Hold on, Eagles.</i>

01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:14.768
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:14:15.936 --> 01:14:18.021
22 hours.

01:14:19.314 --> 01:14:21.525
It's like going to Tuapse.

01:14:22.943 --> 01:14:24.528
In the upper berth.

01:14:53.273 --> 01:14:59.961
The 20th hour of the flight.
2 hours to run the cycle of the automatic landing.

01:15:45.609 --> 01:15:49.504
Hey, it's been a long time, you need to sleep.
There are 10 orbits ahead.

01:15:50.739 --> 01:15:53.575
Later.
I need to finish the drawing.

01:15:53.705 --> 01:15:55.131
Tretyakov Gallery is waiting.

01:15:55.201 --> 01:15:57.479
- Tretyakov Gallery?
- And what did you think?

01:15:57.579 --> 01:16:00.373
The first picture made in space.

01:16:00.624 --> 01:16:04.294
That isn't a drawing flowers in pots.

01:16:04.878 --> 01:16:08.006
They will hang it right next to
"Morning in a Pine Forest".

01:16:08.548 --> 01:16:10.534
Do you know, how they called me
to go to the art Academy?

01:16:10.634 --> 01:16:12.369
They kept the place
until the last moment.

01:16:12.469 --> 01:16:14.996
- Why didn't you go?
- What's the point?

01:16:15.096 --> 01:16:17.515
You can fly and paint.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:20.001
But paint and fly... It's unlikely.

01:16:20.101 --> 01:16:23.338
Well... What's about me,
they called me to visit Cuba.

01:16:23.438 --> 01:16:24.881
- You?
- Yep.

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:27.884
You know, they called
right from the embassy to the ship.

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:29.344
Congratulated.

01:16:29.444 --> 01:16:32.389
"Come here," they say,
"Pavel Ivanovich, for holidays."

01:16:32.489 --> 01:16:36.226
- Ah... But where was I?
- I don't know, you went somewhere.

01:16:36.326 --> 01:16:37.811
Right.

01:16:37.911 --> 01:16:41.081
Brezhnev congratulated me
at the same time.

01:16:41.498 --> 01:16:43.767
He said, he will come to the airport
to meet me.

01:16:43.867 --> 01:16:47.445
"Lyosha," he said,
"Just when you descend the ladder, to the left..."

01:16:47.545 --> 01:16:51.257
..."you'll recognize me, by my hat."

01:16:53.034 --> 01:16:54.494
Then to go to the country.

01:16:54.594 --> 01:16:57.664
No, to the Kremlin first.
Then to the country.

01:16:58.598 --> 01:17:01.935
I wish you would draw instead, Lyosha.

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:18.827
Lyosha.

01:17:21.246 --> 01:17:22.580
Lyosha!

01:17:24.165 --> 01:17:25.734
How do you feel? Normal?

01:17:25.834 --> 01:17:28.169
Yeah, just a little bit queasy.

01:17:28.586 --> 01:17:30.547
But it should be that way.

01:17:31.715 --> 01:17:34.426
- What's with the oxygen?
- One moment.

01:17:36.511 --> 01:17:38.054
No way.

01:17:42.016 --> 01:17:43.585
Almost 300.

01:17:43.685 --> 01:17:45.186
Call.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:50.258
Zarya, this is Almaz.

01:17:50.358 --> 01:17:53.303
<i>The partial pressure is twice
above normal here.</i>

01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:55.029
What's the exact value?

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:56.756
296.

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.343
And still rising.

01:17:58.842 --> 01:18:00.118
Almaz's.

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:02.704
No sudden movements.

01:18:02.804 --> 01:18:05.231
This is not air, but pure oxygen.

01:18:05.331 --> 01:18:08.084
<i>The tiniest spark
and you'll burn instantly.</i>

01:18:08.293 --> 01:18:09.569
Copy!

01:18:10.336 --> 01:18:11.529
What to do?

01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:14.824
Turn off the main lighting.

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:16.718
Stand by for instructions.

01:18:17.051 --> 01:18:18.428
Copy!

01:18:23.224 --> 01:18:24.976
Where is the oxygen coming from?

01:18:27.312 --> 01:18:28.772
They'll find out.

01:18:29.981 --> 01:18:32.008
- There is a leak somewhere...
- From the backpacks?

01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:34.678
Leonov left his in the airlock.
So, it's Belyaev's?

01:18:34.778 --> 01:18:38.356
And the value is 296 at once?
Because of just one backpack?

01:18:38.456 --> 01:18:40.767
Then it's from one
of the compensation leakage tanks.

01:18:40.867 --> 01:18:42.977
But there are not any failures
in the system.

01:18:43.077 --> 01:18:45.480
Tightness of the cabin
isn't damaged either.

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:49.067
Maybe the hatch shifted away
during the blow-off?

01:18:49.167 --> 01:18:52.487
But then we would see
a drastic temperature drop.

01:18:52.587 --> 01:18:55.740
Comrades, their pulse
and pressure are decreasing.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.992
It will be oxygen toxicity soon.

01:18:58.092 --> 01:19:01.037
We need a blueprint
of the central ceiling zone.

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:02.764
The most detailed.

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:10.271
Almaz, most likely
there is a micro fissure.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:14.050
<i>It's useless trying to search it.
It's not dangerous by itself.</i>

01:19:14.609 --> 01:19:19.397
<i>But the system has detected the leak
and automatically started pumping air.</i>

01:19:19.823 --> 01:19:22.934
<i>The compensation detector
can only be turned off manually.</i>

01:19:23.034 --> 01:19:24.853
<i>You'll have to disassemble something.</i>

01:19:24.953 --> 01:19:25.703
That's affirmative.

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:29.023
Sergey Pavlovich! We must not do it!
Everything is under voltage there.

01:19:29.123 --> 01:19:31.125
Do you have any other options?

01:19:31.543 --> 01:19:32.544
Almaz.

01:19:32.644 --> 01:19:35.505
<i>Right above you,
at the central ceiling zone.</i>

01:19:35.605 --> 01:19:41.886
<i>The compensation leakage detector is set
next to the flap for dropping pressure.</i>

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:47.083
<i>Cut the upholstery on the contour.</i>

01:19:47.183 --> 01:19:49.627
This is a gamble.
Remember.

01:19:49.727 --> 01:19:54.858
During assemblage, the technician died.
And he was a qualified specialist.

01:20:02.782 --> 01:20:07.328
Do you see the density of wiring?
And they have no tools and no light.

01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:10.552
My God.

01:20:13.334 --> 01:20:15.378
Zarya, we've cut the upholstery.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:18.156
<i>The detector system
is set behind the wires.</i>

01:20:18.256 --> 01:20:23.453
<i>To get to it, you need to cut the binding
holding the wires.</i>

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:25.079
Copy, Zarya.

01:20:25.697 --> 01:20:27.340
Lyosha, shine the light here.

01:20:28.016 --> 01:20:29.484
<i>What will happen with them?</i>

01:20:29.684 --> 01:20:32.228
Numbness of the limbs
at the beginning.

01:20:33.187 --> 01:20:36.007
<i>Then painful muscle spasms.</i>

01:20:36.107 --> 01:20:40.403
<i>All these amid a background of partial
hearing loss and visual hallucinations.</i>

01:20:42.547 --> 01:20:43.148
Stop!

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:45.051
Easy... Easy.

01:20:46.259 --> 01:20:47.869
Hold on, hold on.

01:20:48.286 --> 01:20:49.504
Easy.

01:20:49.604 --> 01:20:51.080
Carefully.

01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:55.960
Let me do it.

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:58.029
And you'll shine the light.

01:20:58.129 --> 01:20:59.656
<i>Then they will fall asleep.</i>

01:20:59.756 --> 01:21:01.007
<i>At the end.</i>

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:03.426
<i>Fall asleep? That's all?</i>

01:21:04.886 --> 01:21:06.220
Exactly.

01:21:07.013 --> 01:21:08.389
<i>That's all.</i>

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.516
Almaz.

01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:12.460
I'll do it.

01:21:13.353 --> 01:21:15.146
<i>Almaz, do you hear me?</i>

01:21:15.521 --> 01:21:16.856
Hold on.

01:21:17.357 --> 01:21:18.983
Hold on, Pasha.

01:21:20.026 --> 01:21:21.402
<i>Almaz.</i>

01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:23.404
<i>Do do you hear me?</i>

01:21:27.992 --> 01:21:29.327
<i>Almaz.</i>

01:21:31.079 --> 01:21:32.764
<i>Almaz, do you hear me?</i>

01:21:33.164 --> 01:21:35.191
Pasha, you're shining the light so well.

01:21:35.291 --> 01:21:36.918
Evenly.

01:21:37.293 --> 01:21:38.920
So bright.

01:21:41.005 --> 01:21:42.382
Good.

01:21:42.632 --> 01:21:43.967
That's good.

01:21:44.592 --> 01:21:46.135
Ah, Zarya.

01:21:47.095 --> 01:21:48.538
I see.

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:49.973
I see.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.276
I see the detector.

01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:56.104
<i>Well done.
Now the most important part.</i>

01:21:57.855 --> 01:22:00.049
<i>Do you see a yellow wire?</i>

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:04.219
<i>Unplug it.
It's behind the nest of wires.</i>

01:22:04.979 --> 01:22:06.656
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

01:22:07.874 --> 01:22:09.409
Zarya, repeat.

01:22:09.509 --> 01:22:11.311
<i>Behind the nest of wires.</i>

01:22:11.411 --> 01:22:12.646
Repeat, Zarya!

01:22:12.746 --> 01:22:16.508
<i>Unplug the yellow wire.
Behind the nest of wires.</i>

01:22:19.227 --> 01:22:20.862
The nest.

01:22:22.205 --> 01:22:24.107
That's where it lives.

01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:25.767
<i>I didn't get you, Almaz.</i>

01:22:25.867 --> 01:22:28.412
That's where it sleeps.
That's her house.

01:22:28.512 --> 01:22:30.346
<i>What house?</i>

01:22:31.723 --> 01:22:33.891
<i>I didn't get you, Almaz.
Repeat.</i>

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:35.793
We'll unplug it.

01:22:35.893 --> 01:22:36.961
<i>Did you unplug it?</i>

01:22:37.061 --> 01:22:38.563
Where is your house?

01:22:40.232 --> 01:22:42.316
<i>Have you unplugged it?
Almaz?</i>

01:22:45.862 --> 01:22:47.363
OK, I've found it.

01:22:51.868 --> 01:22:53.244
Hold on, Pasha.

01:23:07.133 --> 01:23:08.468
<i>Almaz.</i>

01:23:09.969 --> 01:23:12.013
<i>Almaz, do you hear me?</i>

01:23:14.932 --> 01:23:16.476
<i>Have you unplugged it?</i>

01:23:16.609 --> 01:23:19.729
<i>Don't be silent, speak!
Have you unplugged it? Almaz?</i>

01:23:46.005 --> 01:23:47.240
Almaz, Almaz.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:50.468
There is no signal.
The ship is out of the field of vision.

01:23:51.344 --> 01:23:54.330
The system of automatic orientation...

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.333
...will run before escaping the dead zone.

01:23:57.642 --> 01:23:59.693
Cycle 4 will land them.

01:24:02.814 --> 01:24:05.433
Do they have a chance?

01:24:34.428 --> 01:24:36.180
- Mama?
- Yes?

01:24:37.557 --> 01:24:40.293
Is it night in space too?

01:24:40.393 --> 01:24:41.502
It is.

01:24:41.602 --> 01:24:43.104
Go to sleep.

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:47.441
ls daddy sleeping too?

01:24:49.277 --> 01:24:50.695
Sure.

01:24:52.697 --> 01:24:54.740
Everyone should sleep.

01:25:03.958 --> 01:25:06.294
When I wake up...

01:25:07.295 --> 01:25:10.131
...will daddy fly back?

01:25:13.593 --> 01:25:15.386
He will try.

01:25:18.931 --> 01:25:21.559
He will really really try.

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:48.578
22nd hour of the flight. 25 minutes
past the cycle of automatic landing run

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.533
We've been waiting for the signal,
but it's silence yet.

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:03.269
There is no visual contact too.

01:27:03.469 --> 01:27:05.079
Disgusting.

01:27:06.706 --> 01:27:10.943
A crowd of strong healthy men
sitting like couch potatoes.

01:27:11.043 --> 01:27:13.279
And sighing like it's a funeral.

01:27:13.379 --> 01:27:16.007
<i>If we cannot help our comrades...</i>

01:27:16.107 --> 01:27:20.052
...let's not hold a premature funeral.

01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:21.662
Ma'am.

01:27:21.762 --> 01:27:24.265
Please, coffee for everybody.
And me too.

01:27:24.365 --> 01:27:27.335
Look, let's think logically.

01:27:27.435 --> 01:27:30.087
<i>The ship should have land
23 minutes ago.</i>

01:27:30.187 --> 01:27:33.816
<i>Perhaps during the re-entry
through the atmosphere it was off course...</i>

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:36.552
<i>...and it ended up at an unplanned area.</i>

01:27:36.652 --> 01:27:39.488
You're repeating yourself,
Boris Viktorovich.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:41.515
"Probably, perhaps, it seems..."

01:27:41.615 --> 01:27:45.453
Give me the calculations
for all landing possibilities.

01:27:45.828 --> 01:27:46.938
Sure.

01:27:47.138 --> 01:27:48.080
Prepare the calculations.

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.523
We can't wait any more.

01:27:49.623 --> 01:27:52.777
Let's send some aircraft
to search from the air.

01:27:52.877 --> 01:27:56.213
Sergey Pavlovich, there is a call from Kremlin.
They want to congratulate the successful...

01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:57.381
They will call back.

01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:58.015
Yes, sir.

01:27:58.025 --> 01:27:59.877
We got their parameters!

01:28:00.367 --> 01:28:03.220
They are alive.

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:04.972
We are receiving signal from the ship.

01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:06.449
Signal, there is a signal.

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.394
<i>This is Almaz, over.</i>

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:12.897
Tell them, Korolyov left
to meet the cosmonauts.

01:28:12.997 --> 01:28:14.873
Almaz.

01:28:15.566 --> 01:28:16.901
We read you.

01:28:17.318 --> 01:28:19.987
We are you?
We are you, Eagles?

01:28:20.087 --> 01:28:21.347
In the seats.

01:28:21.447 --> 01:28:23.169
We didn't go anywhere.

01:28:23.269 --> 01:28:24.992
Zarya, this is Almaz.

01:28:26.077 --> 01:28:28.479
We feel normal.

01:28:28.579 --> 01:28:30.790
Cycle 4 hasn't been run.

01:28:31.315 --> 01:28:34.001
<i>Repeat, cycle 4 hasn't been run.</i>

01:28:34.293 --> 01:28:38.546
<i>Just escaping the dead zone.</i>

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.508
Sergey Pavlovich, I...

01:28:40.794 --> 01:28:42.346
I don't have an explanation yet.

01:28:42.426 --> 01:28:45.446
Perhaps, the spin of the ship
was too strong.

01:28:45.546 --> 01:28:47.440
That's an extraordinary situation.

01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:49.904
Oh, is it really?
It's not the first one.

01:28:50.034 --> 01:28:51.519
Did anyone count them?

01:28:51.619 --> 01:28:52.895
<i>I did.</i>

01:28:56.499 --> 01:28:59.143
Let's try to restart the system.

01:28:59.243 --> 01:29:01.987
And land them on in the next orbit.

01:29:03.382 --> 01:29:06.469
We don't have right
to land them in the next orbit.

01:29:06.759 --> 01:29:09.245
The ship will be passing rival territory.

01:29:09.453 --> 01:29:11.897
The guys should be returned to Earth.

01:29:11.997 --> 01:29:14.291
And you will be dealing
with the territory later.

01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:15.735
<i>Zarya, this is Almaz.</i>

01:29:15.965 --> 01:29:20.286
Permission to switch the ship
to manual control immediately.

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:23.384
And implement the landing
right now, over.

01:29:23.504 --> 01:29:26.824
<i>Almaz, we need to calculate
the landing point for that.</i>

01:29:26.944 --> 01:29:28.204
<i>We don't have enough time
for that now.</i>

01:29:28.264 --> 01:29:32.209
Sergey Pavlovich! Don't worry!
We have all calculations.

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:34.503
So, I guesstimated here...

01:29:34.603 --> 01:29:37.857
We'll land in the Urals.
Somewhere in the Perm area.

01:29:37.957 --> 01:29:38.841
Lyosha!

01:29:38.941 --> 01:29:41.260
Be reasonable.
Is that calculations?

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.996
"He guesstimated,
Somewhere in the Perm area."

01:29:44.455 --> 01:29:47.633
On the other hand,
they both are experienced pilots.

01:29:47.733 --> 01:29:51.912
But nobody ever landed a spaceship
in a manual mode.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:54.957
Manual control, it's like, I don't know...

01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:56.609
A straw for a drowning.

01:29:56.709 --> 01:30:00.754
Exclusively only
for desperate situations.

01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:02.339
And what is the situation now?

01:30:02.439 --> 01:30:03.803
<i>Sergey Pavlovich.</i>

01:30:04.003 --> 01:30:05.468
For a minute.

01:30:06.944 --> 01:30:08.220
That's it.

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:11.442
The meeting has begun.

01:30:13.325 --> 01:30:15.811
Now they will gather everyone.

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:19.190
Choose the Chairman.

01:30:19.648 --> 01:30:21.317
Then they will listen to a speaker.

01:30:21.417 --> 01:30:22.985
Start the discussion.

01:30:24.153 --> 01:30:26.351
And you asked me why I didn't reply?

01:30:26.451 --> 01:30:28.850
I would be pushing up daisies by now.

01:30:32.244 --> 01:30:34.697
Come on, we will land our clunker, Pasha.

01:30:34.797 --> 01:30:37.583
We landed a lot more rust buckets
in our day.

01:30:38.017 --> 01:30:39.877
You will land it, won't you?

01:30:43.047 --> 01:30:46.258
- We don't have any other option.
- Why is that?

01:30:46.634 --> 01:30:50.221
We land it manually now,
or they will keep us in the orbit.

01:30:56.644 --> 01:30:59.146
In short, as Motherland would say.

01:31:02.650 --> 01:31:04.985
You think they won't permit it?

01:31:07.655 --> 01:31:09.131
I wouldn't.

01:31:09.698 --> 01:31:13.202
We are not sisters of mercy,
Sergey Pavlovich.

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:17.164
State secrets are not subjects
for experiments.

01:31:17.306 --> 01:31:19.875
<i>Honestly, I don't get you.</i>

01:31:20.876 --> 01:31:24.213
Or I do, but that's even worse.

01:31:24.755 --> 01:31:28.050
Are you offering to keep them in orbit?

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.885
Do I get you right?

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:31.345
We are at war.

01:31:31.595 --> 01:31:33.372
Cold, but quite real.

01:31:33.472 --> 01:31:35.716
What if they end up in Europe?

01:31:35.916 --> 01:31:37.960
Or, God forbid, fly into China.

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:41.647
All the secrets of our space program
will fall into the hands of the enemy.

01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:45.417
So what?
Should they just stay like that?

01:31:45.517 --> 01:31:47.587
So that they won't "fly into somewhere"?

01:31:47.687 --> 01:31:49.530
They are soldiers.

01:31:49.822 --> 01:31:53.951
And the soldiers sometimes have to die.
In the interest of their state.

01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:55.327
I see.

01:31:55.619 --> 01:31:57.438
OK, well...

01:31:57.538 --> 01:31:59.373
The thought isn't new, but...

01:31:59.623 --> 01:32:02.167
...constructive. Thanks. Thanks.

01:32:02.668 --> 01:32:05.929
Maybe, I'll think about it.

01:32:18.517 --> 01:32:19.893
Almaz.

01:32:20.102 --> 01:32:21.604
<i>This is Zarya.</i>

01:32:22.563 --> 01:32:24.940
Switching to manual control...

01:32:30.154 --> 01:32:31.597
...is permitted.

01:32:31.697 --> 01:32:35.451
Start with sealing the spacesuits.

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:37.436
"Zarya", copy that.

01:32:37.536 --> 01:32:38.896
Geting started.

01:32:38.996 --> 01:32:41.415
It's good that you're not the one
who decides.

01:32:49.632 --> 01:32:52.760
<i>"Zarya", repeat,
landing area is approximately...</i>

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.495
Lyosha, they can't hear you.

01:32:54.595 --> 01:32:56.872
They'll find us somehow.
If we land.

01:32:56.972 --> 01:32:59.449
Let's land right on the Red Square?

01:32:59.558 --> 01:33:02.561
Enough talk.
Start stabilization of the spaceship.

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:27.861
It seems we've aligned.

01:33:27.961 --> 01:33:30.197
You see!
You can when you want.

01:33:30.297 --> 01:33:32.549
All we need now is to make it to Earth.

01:33:37.846 --> 01:33:39.206
Lyosha.

01:33:39.306 --> 01:33:40.683
I'm crammed in.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.626
And how...

01:33:42.726 --> 01:33:44.728
How am I supposed to see?

01:33:45.104 --> 01:33:46.939
Maybe I should go out?

01:33:49.942 --> 01:33:51.276
Direct it.

01:33:52.778 --> 01:33:54.113
I'm ready!

01:33:55.656 --> 01:33:56.494
West.

01:33:56.594 --> 01:33:57.733
Done.

01:33:58.375 --> 01:33:59.952
South-west.

01:34:03.956 --> 01:34:05.024
- North.
- Done.

01:34:05.124 --> 01:34:06.109
No, no! North-west.

01:34:06.209 --> 01:34:08.994
North or north-west?
- Easy, easy, easy.

01:34:09.194 --> 01:34:10.871
Clockwise.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.027
<i>Okay, gently.
Even more gently.</i>

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:22.883
- Yes, now west.
- Done.

01:34:23.033 --> 01:34:25.394
Too much! Back it up!
Stop! Stop!

01:34:25.494 --> 01:34:26.770
All over again!

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:30.777
Ready.

01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:32.651
West.

01:34:33.377 --> 01:34:34.653
West!

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:37.364
Pasha, we're losing time.

01:34:37.464 --> 01:34:39.049
That won't work, Lyosha.

01:34:39.249 --> 01:34:39.808
I'll do it myself.

01:34:39.908 --> 01:34:41.785
What are you doing?
The gravity center will shift.

01:34:41.885 --> 01:34:43.537
Free the seat.

01:34:46.139 --> 01:34:47.650
So, where should I go?

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.760
Go there, under the porthole.

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.336
I'll try.

01:34:52.045 --> 01:34:53.881
OK, hold my legs.

01:34:53.981 --> 01:34:55.215
I'm holding.

01:34:57.584 --> 01:34:59.261
Lyosha, I'll take aim.

01:34:59.636 --> 01:35:01.472
And we'll very carefully...

01:35:01.697 --> 01:35:04.074
...quiet as little mice...

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:05.626
...sit back.

01:35:05.726 --> 01:35:08.554
Do it quick, buddy.
Otherwise we'll land in China.

01:35:08.654 --> 01:35:11.882
Don't rush me.
If I slip up, we'll fly into space.

01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:32.780
Easy.

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.923
Back to the seats.

01:35:57.486 --> 01:35:59.196
Is the Earth steady?

01:35:59.905 --> 01:36:01.098
It's drifting.

01:36:01.198 --> 01:36:03.667
- How much?
- About 7 degrees already.

01:36:04.034 --> 01:36:05.410
What's with the nitrogen?

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:06.787
Almost at zero.

01:36:07.996 --> 01:36:09.706
Lyosha, are you attached?

01:36:10.707 --> 01:36:12.084
Yep.

01:36:27.741 --> 01:36:29.801
Retro engine run has been detected.

01:36:30.330 --> 01:36:32.983
It'd be great to know
where they will end up.

01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:35.566
We'll end up in jail, if anything.

01:36:35.766 --> 01:36:37.025
But they will land.

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:39.623
The telemetry detected some inclination.

01:36:39.723 --> 01:36:42.222
It seems, they left their seats
to take aim.

01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:45.200
And when they were sitting back,
the gravity center shifted.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.602
So what?

01:36:46.902 --> 01:36:48.883
The landing path can change.

01:36:48.983 --> 01:36:51.164
Sergey Pavlovich, can I?

01:36:51.498 --> 01:36:56.328
With the inclination over six
or seven degrees...

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.128
...they will get into the atmosphere...

01:36:58.188 --> 01:36:59.756
...with a very acute angle.

01:36:59.856 --> 01:37:02.104
The spaceship might ricochet off...

01:37:02.344 --> 01:37:04.807
...and get back to the orbit again.

01:37:04.867 --> 01:37:07.531
The gravity will pull them back...

01:37:07.631 --> 01:37:09.716
But that won't be soon.

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:13.745
Boris Viktorovich, calculate
all possible landing areas.

01:37:13.845 --> 01:37:15.184
Stay focused.

01:37:15.284 --> 01:37:16.823
Let's wait...

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.515
...for the transmitter signal.

01:37:20.519 --> 01:37:22.195
And hope...

01:37:23.105 --> 01:37:24.606
...for the best.

01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:40.105
Is it Thursday?

01:37:40.814 --> 01:37:42.249
Or Friday?

01:37:43.133 --> 01:37:44.509
I have no idea.

01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:49.473
You think the children have got up?

01:37:51.934 --> 01:37:54.519
I wonder if Vika
went to the daycare or again...

01:37:55.619 --> 01:37:57.219
...is still sleeping.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.019
Lyosha, don't worry.

01:38:03.445 --> 01:38:06.073
If I slipped up,
then in about three years...

01:38:06.173 --> 01:38:08.325
...the gravity will work anyway.

01:38:08.425 --> 01:38:10.285
Be buried with honours.

01:38:17.834 --> 01:38:19.169
So...

01:38:21.630 --> 01:38:23.173
Let's have a bite to eat.

01:38:28.929 --> 01:38:31.932
How about that!
What delicacies!

01:38:35.644 --> 01:38:36.979
Borscht.

01:38:38.438 --> 01:38:40.357
It's a pity there's no garlic.

01:38:48.573 --> 01:38:49.992
Do you want some?

01:39:00.127 --> 01:39:01.328
Lyosha!

01:39:01.428 --> 01:39:02.629
You are...

01:39:06.508 --> 01:39:08.385
Seems like gravity.

01:39:09.928 --> 01:39:12.556
Belay the delicacies!
Going home!

01:39:13.890 --> 01:39:16.143
That's affirmative,
comrade commander!

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.806
Blowing-off reserve retro engine.

01:39:31.575 --> 01:39:33.176
<i>Separation confirmed.</i>

01:39:34.019 --> 01:39:36.897
Get ready for instrument module separation.
Blow-off!

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:42.733
Partial, the module
hasn't been separated.

01:39:42.921 --> 01:39:45.424
Lyosha, hold on!
It's going to spin.

01:40:29.483 --> 01:40:32.636
Okay!
It came apart!

01:42:04.561 --> 01:42:05.896
Alive?

01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:10.984
Pasha?

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.592
Yes, I am!

01:42:23.692 --> 01:42:25.065
You fool!

01:42:25.165 --> 01:42:28.126
- Were you scared?
- Why'd you do that?

01:42:28.226 --> 01:42:30.003
- Done?
- Yeah.

01:42:34.049 --> 01:42:35.383
Let's go?

01:42:36.676 --> 01:42:37.744
Ready?

01:42:37.844 --> 01:42:39.679
It will be loud.

01:42:39.779 --> 01:42:41.014
Wait a sec.

01:43:02.118 --> 01:43:04.704
- So are you ready?
- Yep.

01:45:01.821 --> 01:45:04.491
3 hours after the landing

01:45:11.665 --> 01:45:14.684
<i>We are at square 24, no signal.</i>

01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:27.806
<i>Square 22, still nothing.</i>

01:45:27.972 --> 01:45:31.976
<i>In the whole short-wave range, no signal.
Continue searching.</i>

01:45:35.472 --> 01:45:38.358
Why, with all the power
of Soviet science...

01:45:38.458 --> 01:45:41.486
...we cannot detect one radio beacon...

01:45:41.586 --> 01:45:43.488
...in a given square!

01:45:44.422 --> 01:45:48.201
The signal disappeared during re-entry
into the atmosphere. It can mean...

01:45:48.351 --> 01:45:49.627
It can't.

01:45:49.986 --> 01:45:52.280
We need specific versions.

01:45:53.348 --> 01:45:54.824
Sergey Pavlovich.

01:45:55.725 --> 01:45:58.745
Apparently, they landed somewhere
we didn't expect.

01:45:58.845 --> 01:46:02.065
<i>A full-scaled search operation
has been deployed.</i>

01:46:02.165 --> 01:46:04.241
You need to cool down.

01:46:04.741 --> 01:46:05.718
And get some rest.

01:46:05.818 --> 01:46:07.595
I'll get rest when we've found them.

01:46:07.695 --> 01:46:09.873
What are the assumptions?

01:46:09.973 --> 01:46:14.661
First, the beacon might be broken
from a hard landing.

01:46:15.119 --> 01:46:18.815
Second, they might have damaged it
when they were cutting the upholstery.

01:46:18.915 --> 01:46:21.317
They have a portable transmitter
for that case.

01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:23.182
To send signals manually.

01:46:23.282 --> 01:46:25.347
So why can't we detect it?

01:46:25.447 --> 01:46:27.987
The batteries of the transmitter
don't work at low temperature.

01:46:28.007 --> 01:46:30.647
So what? It wouldn't dawn upon them
how to warm a battery?

01:46:30.727 --> 01:46:33.229
First, they have to work out
how to warm themselves.

01:46:33.329 --> 01:46:36.916
The spacesuits, unplugged from the life support
system, are not designed for low temperature.

01:46:37.016 --> 01:46:40.795
They cannot shelter in the capsule as well.
It will be like a freezer in an hour.

01:46:40.895 --> 01:46:44.115
Perhaps, the radio waves
just cannot pass.

01:46:44.415 --> 01:46:49.095
The quality of a short-wave signal depends
a lot on a terrain and weather conditions.

01:46:49.195 --> 01:46:53.516
Let's say they turned out to be
in adverse weather conditions.

01:46:54.434 --> 01:46:56.728
How long can they hold out?

01:46:57.645 --> 01:46:59.022
A day.

01:47:16.706 --> 01:47:19.501
Taiga.
It's turning off the signal.

01:47:21.103 --> 01:47:23.396
But we will use Morse code.

01:47:23.546 --> 01:47:26.382
We'll make it with good old Morse code.

01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:30.711
Morse code is very reliable.

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:33.973
You'd better winterize, Alexey.

01:47:34.599 --> 01:47:36.017
I'll be OK.

01:48:40.039 --> 01:48:41.033
V-N.

01:48:41.133 --> 01:48:43.030
V-N, V-N...

01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:45.128
What's"V-N"?

01:48:55.722 --> 01:48:57.215
V-N, "Everything normal".

01:48:57.315 --> 01:48:58.708
Have you lost your mind?

01:48:58.808 --> 01:49:00.593
They've landed, our eagles! V-N!

01:49:00.693 --> 01:49:02.478
- What?
- It's V-N."Everything normal".

01:49:02.578 --> 01:49:04.339
So you're "everything normal"?

01:49:04.439 --> 01:49:06.966
Hey, wait! It will be the most interesting
moment now. Rescue operation.

01:49:07.066 --> 01:49:09.528
Don't worry.
They will rescue them without you.

01:49:10.128 --> 01:49:12.155
They will show everything
on TV tomorrow.

01:49:12.255 --> 01:49:14.511
- Ahh, why do you always...
- Go, go.

01:49:14.611 --> 01:49:16.868
Enough of interfering with state secrets.

01:49:24.125 --> 01:49:25.543
The Kremlin...

01:49:26.294 --> 01:49:28.755
...is waiting for an official statement.

01:49:29.172 --> 01:49:32.425
We have to do it tomorrow by 10 AM.

01:49:32.525 --> 01:49:34.844
We have nothing to report yet.

01:49:43.936 --> 01:49:46.898
Sergey Pavlovich,
you need to get some rest.

01:49:47.649 --> 01:49:49.592
Nothing depends on you now.

01:49:49.692 --> 01:49:53.696
There is a plenty of time until the morning,
if we don't waste it.

01:49:54.113 --> 01:49:56.432
Comrade lieutenant general!
Permission to speak.

01:49:56.532 --> 01:50:00.453
The weather report has come. Heavy snowfall
is expected all over the Ural ridge.

01:50:00.553 --> 01:50:02.272
An Arctic cyclone is moving there.

01:50:02.372 --> 01:50:05.249
The temperature will fall
to -31 F at night.

01:50:05.349 --> 01:50:06.626
<i>At night.</i>

01:50:07.377 --> 01:50:10.271
But it's still daylight now, right?

01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.984
<i>It's still daylight.</i>

01:50:16.536 --> 01:50:19.538
6 hours after landing

01:50:22.150 --> 01:50:26.596
If they have got the signal,
it's about two hours for triangulation.

01:50:26.662 --> 01:50:29.649
So they are going to come soon.

01:50:29.749 --> 01:50:31.025
They'll be soon.

01:50:31.859 --> 01:50:33.494
If they got it.

01:50:38.866 --> 01:50:40.243
Here.

01:50:40.827 --> 01:50:42.412
Your turn.

01:50:44.497 --> 01:50:46.457
Chill out.

01:50:47.667 --> 01:50:49.711
We knew what we were getting into.

01:50:53.381 --> 01:50:55.550
If they find the journal...

01:50:55.925 --> 01:50:58.231
...consider, the task is completed.

01:50:58.731 --> 01:51:00.538
What do you mean completed?

01:51:01.139 --> 01:51:03.224
Did you forget about your girls?

01:51:05.351 --> 01:51:09.647
They are ironing your uniform.
Preparing to meet their dad alive.

01:51:09.981 --> 01:51:11.899
You understand?
Alive.

01:51:12.692 --> 01:51:15.820
Not a frozen piece of mammoth shit.

01:51:16.154 --> 01:51:17.488
No, buddy.

01:51:19.157 --> 01:51:20.575
Give me a hand.

01:51:22.285 --> 01:51:23.661
No!

01:51:25.121 --> 01:51:27.123
My family won't forgive me for this.

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:30.543
Who will take Vika to school
for the first time?

01:51:32.587 --> 01:51:34.338
So here it is, comrade Belyaev.

01:51:34.822 --> 01:51:36.549
There wasn't an order to give up.

01:51:36.751 --> 01:51:38.578
Don't get bored, I'll be back soon.

01:52:15.588 --> 01:52:17.340
Pass the order.

01:52:18.424 --> 01:52:20.927
Put everything into the air that flies.

01:52:21.027 --> 01:52:22.937
Double the search area.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.277
Yes, sir.

01:52:26.974 --> 01:52:28.559
General Kamanin's order.

01:52:29.268 --> 01:52:32.647
Send the text
for the record of the message.

01:52:32.747 --> 01:52:35.233
Which one, Nikolay Petrovich?

01:52:35.333 --> 01:52:36.859
Both variants.

01:52:40.504 --> 01:52:42.156
Good evening, comrades.

01:53:03.469 --> 01:53:05.471
"death of the crew"

01:53:07.265 --> 01:53:08.975
May I have some water?

01:53:40.339 --> 01:53:42.049
I'm ready.

01:53:47.314 --> 01:53:48.548
"Ready"

01:53:52.802 --> 01:53:55.004
March 18th...

01:53:56.055 --> 01:53:59.124
...1965...

01:54:00.735 --> 01:54:05.613
<i>...in the Soviet Union,
for the purpose of testing...</i>

01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:12.170
<i>...the Voskhod 2 spacecraft
was sent to the orbit of planet Earth.</i>

01:54:22.506 --> 01:54:26.260
<i>It was manned by two pilots
and cosmonauts of the USSR...</i>

01:54:27.345 --> 01:54:30.865
<i>...Lieutenant Colonel
Pavel lvanovich Belyaev...</i>

01:54:33.651 --> 01:54:37.480
<i>...and Major Alexey Arkhipovich Leonov.</i>

01:54:39.231 --> 01:54:44.835
<i>During the test flight,
which lasted more than a day...</i>

01:54:51.661 --> 01:54:57.257
<i>During the landing,
the ropes of the parachute twisted...</i>

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:04.496
<i>...and the spaceship continued falling
with a high speed.</i>

01:55:09.370 --> 01:55:11.863
<i>Which was the cause of...</i>

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:16.384
<i>...death of the crew.</i>

01:55:20.648 --> 01:55:23.442
Are you guys off your rocker?
You kidding us?

01:55:24.819 --> 01:55:26.195
Hey!

01:55:26.654 --> 01:55:28.714
Where are you?

01:55:29.490 --> 01:55:32.034
Ain't you got no brains?

01:55:32.493 --> 01:55:34.620
We are alive here!

01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:37.564
Hey! We're alive.

01:55:39.358 --> 01:55:41.711
Are you deaf or what?

01:55:41.811 --> 01:55:43.029
Hey!

01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:44.714
We're alive.

01:55:44.856 --> 01:55:47.941
Hey, we're alive.

01:56:19.331 --> 01:56:21.600
<i>...untimely death...</i>

01:56:21.876 --> 01:56:25.087
<i>...of the remarkable researchers
and cosmonauts...</i>

01:56:25.588 --> 01:56:28.082
<i>...Pavel lvanovich Belyaev...</i>

01:56:29.091 --> 01:56:31.777
<i>...and Alexey Arkhipovich Leonov...</i>

01:56:33.471 --> 01:56:38.692
<i>...is a heavy and irreparable loss...</i>

01:56:39.769 --> 01:56:42.854
<i>...for the whole nation of the Soviet Union.</i>

01:56:48.608 --> 01:56:51.677
<i>They have been awarded the title of...</i>

01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:55.576
<i>...Heroes of Soviet Union.</i>

01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:59.774
<i>Posthumously.</i>

01:57:02.666 --> 01:57:04.251
Pasha.

01:57:16.472 --> 01:57:17.848
Pasha.

01:57:19.058 --> 01:57:20.392
Pasha.

01:57:28.109 --> 01:57:29.393
Are you OK?

01:57:29.493 --> 01:57:30.773
Don't sleep!

01:57:30.873 --> 01:57:32.154
Hey, Pasha.

01:57:32.254 --> 01:57:33.431
Pasha!

01:57:33.531 --> 01:57:35.616
Don't think of sleeping!
Don't sleep!

01:57:35.716 --> 01:57:36.992
Pasha!

01:57:38.327 --> 01:57:39.912
That's it, Lyosha.

01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:43.332
Pavel Ivanovich.

01:57:43.582 --> 01:57:44.859
Alright.

01:57:44.959 --> 01:57:46.986
Do you know
what we're going to do now?

01:57:47.086 --> 01:57:49.238
We will reherse the speech
for the reporters.

01:57:49.338 --> 01:57:52.258
- Because you're always standing like a...
- You'll handle it by yourself.

01:57:52.358 --> 01:57:53.717
You're a hero now.

01:57:53.817 --> 01:57:54.994
Am I? Nah.

01:57:55.094 --> 01:57:57.721
You were a hero
when I just helped to farm cows.

01:57:58.055 --> 01:57:59.999
And you'd already been to war.

01:58:00.099 --> 01:58:03.644
How many battle flights did you already have!
And I was only dreaming about the sky.

01:58:03.744 --> 01:58:05.020
One.

01:58:05.437 --> 01:58:06.814
One what?

01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:08.732
One flight.

01:58:11.193 --> 01:58:13.988
And I didn't even shoot.

01:58:14.947 --> 01:58:19.451
The older guys fought, and we,
younger guys, prepared the planes.

01:58:19.551 --> 01:58:21.620
Swept the aerodrome.

01:58:23.622 --> 01:58:26.584
And finally,
they gave me a battle flight.

01:58:26.684 --> 01:58:29.570
I thought, here is my turn!

01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:31.881
Maybe I'll be useful for something.

01:58:32.673 --> 01:58:35.534
The enemy didn't attack us.

01:58:35.634 --> 01:58:38.262
We flew and returned to the base.

01:58:39.054 --> 01:58:40.973
As if we didn't even fly.

01:58:43.392 --> 01:58:47.188
And on the next day they capitulated.

01:58:48.230 --> 01:58:50.316
Well, here's your "hero".

01:58:50.416 --> 01:58:52.026
Pavel Belyaev.

01:59:05.414 --> 01:59:06.790
Do you know...

01:59:07.541 --> 01:59:09.485
...why I went to flight school?

01:59:09.585 --> 01:59:12.671
- Why?
- The allowance was bigger than in the art Academy.

01:59:13.964 --> 01:59:17.092
Right now I would be painting my pictures
living on easy street.

01:59:17.192 --> 01:59:21.764
But no. The whole world saw
how I dangled from the tether.

01:59:21.864 --> 01:59:25.100
It was inflated so much,
I almost shit my spacesuit.

01:59:25.276 --> 01:59:28.979
Here is a conqueror of space
Alexey Leonov.

01:59:30.564 --> 01:59:32.900
Pashka, forgive me.

01:59:34.193 --> 01:59:35.945
That I got you into this.

01:59:36.237 --> 01:59:37.947
No, no.

01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:41.283
That's good.

01:59:41.951 --> 01:59:43.869
What's good?

01:59:44.328 --> 01:59:46.163
It's good that...

01:59:47.289 --> 01:59:49.124
...you didn't become an artist.

01:59:49.667 --> 01:59:54.736
Otherwise, who else
would I fly with so well.

01:59:58.425 --> 02:00:00.803
Maybe we'll fly again.

02:00:02.972 --> 02:00:06.725
Depends on what Motherland will say.

02:00:07.226 --> 02:00:10.254
What the Motherland will say.

02:00:42.303 --> 02:00:43.721
They've landed.

02:00:44.096 --> 02:00:45.556
Successfully.

02:00:45.848 --> 02:00:47.308
Asking for help.

02:00:47.725 --> 02:00:49.335
But nobody's coming to them.

02:00:49.435 --> 02:00:52.062
But they will come for you,
and you'll go to jail.

02:00:52.162 --> 02:00:53.731
Very successful.

02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:57.985
But I won't have anyone
to ask for help.

02:01:12.374 --> 02:01:14.084
But how else?

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:33.035
9 hours from the landing

02:01:34.188 --> 02:01:36.882
The weather turned bad.

02:01:36.982 --> 02:01:39.401
I have to pause the search operation.

02:01:42.446 --> 02:01:43.864
I see...

02:01:44.198 --> 02:01:46.241
As soon as the storm stops...

02:01:46.341 --> 02:01:48.035
Yes, yes... Of course.

02:01:48.702 --> 02:01:50.412
We have to inform...

02:01:50.704 --> 02:01:52.289
...the families.

02:01:53.123 --> 02:01:55.834
Sergey Pavlovich, maybe...

02:01:55.934 --> 02:01:57.340
...we shouldn't hurry?

02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.046
But what do you want?

02:01:59.396 --> 02:02:02.849
Do you want them to hear about it
from the radio announcer?

02:02:04.093 --> 02:02:05.677
<i>We've got the signal!</i>

02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:08.831
Sergey Pavlovich, it seems...
we've got the signal.

02:02:08.931 --> 02:02:10.374
What you mean, "it seems"?

02:02:10.474 --> 02:02:11.704
I'm sorry, comrade Lieutenant General.

02:02:11.804 --> 02:02:13.435
There was a call from the Committee.

02:02:13.735 --> 02:02:16.255
Some radio fan from Sakhalin
got in touch with them.

02:02:16.355 --> 02:02:19.591
He says, he accidentally got a signal
from the cosmonauts.

02:02:19.691 --> 02:02:21.443
Accidentally?
How's that an accident?

02:02:21.543 --> 02:02:22.549
<i>Accidentally.</i>

02:02:22.649 --> 02:02:24.855
- Radio fan.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:26.501
- Sakhalin.
- Yes, sir.

02:02:26.623 --> 02:02:27.675
Which square?

02:02:27.775 --> 02:02:31.112
According the triangulation
it turns out... square 62nd.

02:02:31.190 --> 02:02:33.442
Do we have anyone at the 62nd?

02:02:35.332 --> 02:02:37.835
Yes, we have one helicopter
within a mile from there.

02:02:37.935 --> 02:02:39.395
- Call him.
- Yes, sir.

02:02:41.713 --> 02:02:45.868
<i>Craft '216'! The signal from the cosmonauts
was located at the 62nd square.</i>

02:02:45.968 --> 02:02:49.463
You are the closest.
Try to gain visual contact.

02:02:49.563 --> 02:02:53.100
<i>Repeat, try to gain visual contact.</i>

02:02:53.392 --> 02:02:55.302
This is '216'.

02:02:55.502 --> 02:02:58.213
<i>I'm at square 62.</i>

02:02:58.313 --> 02:03:00.883
The meteorological conditions are bad.

02:03:00.983 --> 02:03:04.428
- Continue the search while you can.
- Yes, sir.

02:03:15.122 --> 02:03:16.790
You hear?

02:03:22.296 --> 02:03:23.755
You hear?

02:03:26.383 --> 02:03:28.427
That's for us.

02:03:29.052 --> 02:03:30.888
They've found us.

02:03:34.266 --> 02:03:35.809
Where?

02:03:36.393 --> 02:03:38.020
The flare gun.

02:03:39.771 --> 02:03:41.106
Pasha.

02:03:46.695 --> 02:03:48.363
Where's the flare gun?

02:03:48.864 --> 02:03:50.949
Did I lose it?

02:03:51.049 --> 02:03:53.243
Uh? Klutz.

02:03:56.246 --> 02:03:57.832
Commander, the tanks are almost dry.

02:03:57.932 --> 02:04:00.993
We should get back,
or we might not make it to the base.

02:04:02.085 --> 02:04:04.963
This is '216',
we are almost out of fuel here.

02:04:05.839 --> 02:04:07.324
They have to get back.

02:04:07.424 --> 02:04:09.635
- Let them get back.
- Yes, sir.

02:04:11.887 --> 02:04:14.806
'216', return to base.

02:04:18.519 --> 02:04:19.895
'216'.

02:04:20.687 --> 02:04:22.105
This is Korolyov.

02:04:22.205 --> 02:04:23.173
Sergey.

02:04:23.273 --> 02:04:24.816
What's your name?

02:04:25.108 --> 02:04:26.735
Major Markelov.

02:04:27.236 --> 02:04:28.570
<i>And your first name?</i>

02:04:28.670 --> 02:04:29.988
Vladimir.

02:04:30.822 --> 02:04:33.684
<i>Volodya, listen to me.</i>

02:04:33.784 --> 02:04:35.486
Somewhere on the trees there...

02:04:35.786 --> 02:04:38.430
...there must be a chute.

02:04:38.914 --> 02:04:40.774
It's really big.

02:04:40.874 --> 02:04:42.251
Noticeable.

02:04:42.876 --> 02:04:45.254
Please, look closely.

02:04:46.547 --> 02:04:48.423
It's hard not to notice it.

02:04:49.091 --> 02:04:50.676
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

02:04:51.134 --> 02:04:52.411
That's affirmative.

02:05:00.652 --> 02:05:02.171
What's the...

02:05:02.271 --> 02:05:04.690
Where did I put it, ah?

02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:07.734
Why all half-assed...

02:05:07.834 --> 02:05:09.361
Come on, help.

02:05:10.028 --> 02:05:12.656
Lyosha, help, it froze.

02:05:15.033 --> 02:05:16.868
Pashka!

02:05:19.246 --> 02:05:21.306
Here you go, man.

02:05:21.498 --> 02:05:22.916
Hold on.

02:05:24.109 --> 02:05:26.862
We have emergency fuel.
We must go.

02:05:30.424 --> 02:05:33.852
Lyosha, give a signal.
Can't see anything.

02:05:33.952 --> 02:05:35.950
Hold on, Pashka.

02:05:36.250 --> 02:05:37.848
You're the man.

02:05:38.615 --> 02:05:41.184
Wait... I'll help you.

02:05:42.227 --> 02:05:43.604
Hold on.

02:05:48.692 --> 02:05:52.279
Commander! We must leave,
or we won't make it to the base.

02:05:53.238 --> 02:05:54.906
<i>This is '216'.</i>

02:05:55.699 --> 02:05:57.768
<i>We can't see the chute.</i>

02:05:57.868 --> 02:06:00.287
<i>There is no a signal
from the cosmonauts.</i>

02:06:00.996 --> 02:06:02.843
We tried.

02:06:02.943 --> 02:06:04.391
We are sorry.

02:06:06.835 --> 02:06:09.880
- Can't bend my fingers.
- Come on, do it slowly.

02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:11.632
Pasha, do it slowly.

02:06:17.095 --> 02:06:20.156
Come on... Come on.

02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:22.056
I can't.

02:06:25.395 --> 02:06:28.006
'216'.
<i>Return to base.</i>

02:06:28.106 --> 02:06:30.192
That's affirmative.
Going back.

02:06:36.582 --> 02:06:38.200
This is '216'!

02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:41.260
A flare!
Signal flare!

02:06:41.344 --> 02:06:42.522
Send the rescue team.

02:06:42.622 --> 02:06:45.324
<i>'216', we need the exact coordinates.</i>

02:06:45.700 --> 02:06:49.703
<i>20 miles south-east of Bereznyaky town.</i>

02:06:51.838 --> 02:06:55.859
<i>The coordinates: 56 degrees, 37 minutes...</i>

02:07:33.288 --> 02:07:36.660
Thank you, Volodya.

02:07:51.481 --> 02:07:53.683
Can I get something?

02:07:54.083 --> 02:07:55.483
Something stronger?

02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:57.549
Sure, Sergey Pavlovich.

02:08:08.674 --> 02:08:14.254
Chkalovsky Aerodrome. Moscow Oblast
The third day after the launch

02:09:06.556 --> 02:09:08.058
Daddy!

02:09:18.652 --> 02:09:20.195
Dad!

02:09:22.531 --> 02:09:23.907
Lyoshka!

02:09:30.997 --> 02:09:34.251
What are you doing, kid?
Where did you go in the middle of the night?

02:09:37.103 --> 02:09:38.680
She sleeps anywhere.

02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:39.818
Who?

02:09:39.918 --> 02:09:41.207
The bird.

02:09:41.958 --> 02:09:43.610
That's good for you!

02:09:44.945 --> 02:09:47.681
Weren't you scared?

02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:56.543
Your heart is beating fast.

02:09:56.660 --> 02:10:00.189
- Did you run around?
- No, dad, I didn't run.

02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:01.915
I flew.

02:10:22.148 --> 02:10:24.551
<i>This is Moscow broadcast.</i>

02:10:25.527 --> 02:10:28.121
