00:40.884 --> 00:43.339
<i>Technically speaking, I'm an alien.</i>

00:43.439 --> 00:48.274
<i>And from the perspective
of immigration, an illegal one.</i>

00:49.501 --> 00:54.093
<i>My parents met at the university in Saint
Petersburg where he taught astrophysics</i>

00:54.193 --> 00:57.149
<i>and she taught applied mathematics.</i>

00:57.249 --> 01:00.089
<i>My mother fell in love with him
when she found him almost frozen to death</i>

01:00.189 --> 01:04.013
<i>on the bank of the Neva,
staring at the stars.</i>

01:09.783 --> 01:13.749
Tonight, the sky is completely
full of miracles.

01:15.411 --> 01:18.275
<i>My mother won't talk much
about that time.</i>

01:18.375 --> 01:20.528
<i>But my aunt Nino told me
about my father.</i>

01:20.628 --> 01:22.203
Max...

01:22.303 --> 01:26.891
<i>His name was Maximilian Jones
and he was the son of an English diplomat</i>

01:26.991 --> 01:30.414
<i>who always saw the best in people.</i>

01:34.063 --> 01:36.275
<i>I often wonder if what happened
to my mother and father</i>

01:36.375 --> 01:39.775
<i>changed me from someone
who might have seen the best in people</i>

01:39.875 --> 01:42.328
<i>to someone who always expects
the worst.</i>

01:43.121 --> 01:45.242
How's my Jupiter?

01:51.188 --> 01:53.943
Not a planet. The planet.

01:54.043 --> 01:58.735
The biggest and most beautiful planet
in our solar system.

01:58.835 --> 02:02.876
She is our Jupiter.

02:02.984 --> 02:07.252
Over my dead body
we will name her "Jupiter."

02:10.140 --> 02:15.034
Soon you will discover that your mother can
be extraordinarily unreasonable at times.

02:15.837 --> 02:21.870
But fortunately for us, she remains
susceptible to your father's particular...

02:22.949 --> 02:24.134
charm.

02:38.896 --> 02:41.217
No, oh, no, oh, no!
No, not the telescope, please!

02:41.317 --> 02:43.855
Don't take the telescope, please!

02:49.267 --> 02:52.113
Max! Ma...

03:13.389 --> 03:17.671
<i>In her grief, my mother pushed everyone
except her sister out of her life.</i>

03:22.245 --> 03:24.535
<i>Somewhere in the middle
of the Atlantic,</i>

03:24.635 --> 03:26.823
<i>she pushed me out too.</i>

03:27.523 --> 03:29.969
Pusha. Pusha!

03:34.052 --> 03:37.627
<i>I was born without a country.
Without a home.</i>

03:38.127 --> 03:40.184
<i>Without a father.</i>

03:44.481 --> 03:47.678
<i>But I was born in the house of Leo...</i>

03:50.701 --> 03:54.891
<i>with Jupiter rising at twenty-three
degrees ascendant.</i>

03:56.870 --> 03:58.533
<i>According to my aunt,</i>

03:58.633 --> 04:02.624
<i>this is supposed to mean
that I am destined for great things</i>

04:02.724 --> 04:06.666
<i>and that I will find
the one true love of my life.</i>

04:09.270 --> 04:11.960
- Jupiter.
- Coming!

04:12.060 --> 04:14.263
- You finish the bathroom yet?
- Not yet.

04:16.017 --> 04:19.055
- We still have another house tonight.
- I'll be fast.

04:20.108 --> 04:22.687
<i>Problem with astrology?</i>

04:24.609 --> 04:27.234
<i>Total bullshit.</i>

05:19.940 --> 05:22.713
What was the name of this planet?

05:22.813 --> 05:25.251
Zalintyre, I think.

05:26.237 --> 05:28.233
Have you ever seen a harvest?

05:28.333 --> 05:31.729
Oh, no. Never!

05:31.829 --> 05:34.735
But I've heard they feel no pain.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.357
It's all quite humane,
from what I've been told.

05:37.558 --> 05:39.360
Well, there are marshals
and administrators

05:39.460 --> 05:42.217
to make sure everything's done
according to code, but still...

05:42.317 --> 05:44.939
It can be rather... affecting.

05:45.339 --> 05:48.211
Now you sound like Mother.

05:49.681 --> 05:54.123
Most of them were miserable in their lives
and what we do for them is a mercy.

05:54.423 --> 05:57.095
Balem, thank you for responding.

05:57.195 --> 06:00.485
We were just admiring this ledger
from your latest success.

06:00.585 --> 06:01.971
Well done, brother.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.427
The house of Abrasax
continues to thrive,

06:04.527 --> 06:07.582
despite the squandering
of your inheritance, brother.

06:07.682 --> 06:10.304
I must say, you're looking
a little worse for wear.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.193
Could it be success
does not agree with you?

06:13.293 --> 06:15.815
And you look so well.

06:15.915 --> 06:18.787
Could it be that failure
agrees with you?

06:19.288 --> 06:22.870
You may have inherited Mother's head
for business, but I inherited her heart.

06:22.970 --> 06:24.582
And what does that leave me?

06:25.083 --> 06:27.037
- Her beauty.
- Liar.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.271
- Her humor.
- Her unluckiness in love?

06:30.371 --> 06:32.147
Her fetish for wrinkles.

06:32.247 --> 06:34.468
Well, if this is to be another
of your eulogies, Titus,

06:34.568 --> 06:36.939
I have more important matters
to attend.

06:37.039 --> 06:39.310
It was her birthday recently.

06:39.410 --> 06:42.583
You know I get sentimental, and I was going
through some of Mother's old sheave-work

06:42.683 --> 06:46.648
and I came across a description of a planet
she claimed was the most rare

06:46.748 --> 06:50.733
and beautiful estate she ever owned.

06:50.833 --> 06:54.223
- I believe she named it...
- Earth.

06:54.323 --> 06:58.415
...earth. It was part of your inheritance,
wasn't it, brother?

06:58.515 --> 07:00.839
I was quite moved by her description
and I was wondering

07:00.939 --> 07:04.008
if there was any chance
you might be willing to part with it.

07:05.129 --> 07:08.901
Titus, didn't you bother
to look at the sheaves?

07:09.001 --> 07:11.756
That planet is worth more
than all of your estates combined.

07:12.157 --> 07:13.961
Really?

07:14.061 --> 07:16.394
I had no idea.

07:20.072 --> 07:22.808
- Kalique.
- Balem.

07:51.182 --> 07:53.989
Jupiter, get up!

07:54.505 --> 07:56.525
Get up!

07:59.583 --> 08:02.170
Jupiter, make the coffee. Come on.

08:03.506 --> 08:05.781
I hate my life.

08:19.721 --> 08:21.140
Jupiter, hurry up!

08:21.340 --> 08:23.361
That one goes next to that one.

08:24.364 --> 08:26.818
Jupiter! Get the garbage after this.

08:27.119 --> 08:29.920
- You finish the bathroom?
- No.

08:37.004 --> 08:38.006
Jupiter!

08:38.306 --> 08:40.998
I hate my life.

09:03.738 --> 09:05.058
Damn it.

09:06.101 --> 09:07.848
Told you.

09:12.006 --> 09:13.375
Lycantant.

09:13.775 --> 09:15.762
Another Hunter.

09:15.862 --> 09:18.610
And ex-legion. He was a skyjacker.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.975
- How do you know that?
- The boots.

09:39.591 --> 09:43.216
There was a Hunter in the legion.
A legend.

09:43.366 --> 09:46.488
Could track a single gene in the gyre.

09:46.588 --> 09:50.672
No matter who or what he is...
he's after our bounty.

11:53.032 --> 11:55.470
That's him. It's got to be.

11:55.570 --> 11:57.674
We should warn Lord Balem.

11:57.774 --> 11:59.764
That is what we should do, but...

12:01.581 --> 12:03.347
Do you trust me?

12:09.047 --> 12:11.051
This matter must be handled
with delicacy, malidictes.

12:11.151 --> 12:12.971
I understand, lady Kalique.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.620
Neither Balem nor Titus
must suspect my involvement.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.282
Of course, Your Majesty.

12:21.403 --> 12:24.042
You believe The Hunters can be trusted?

12:24.142 --> 12:28.451
Trust is an illusion, my lady.
I believe only in mutual self-interest.

12:28.551 --> 12:32.058
They want another life.
We can offer it.

12:32.559 --> 12:34.846
Make the deal.

13:41.808 --> 13:44.147
Welcome back, Lord Balem.

13:44.247 --> 13:46.685
It has been too long.

13:47.252 --> 13:51.511
I have not crossed the vastness
of space for your pleasantries, Mr. Night.

13:51.711 --> 13:55.720
Of course, My Lord.
We have verified the geneprint.

13:56.421 --> 13:59.241
Most unfortunate news.

13:59.894 --> 14:03.351
I believe Titus is aware
of the recurrence.

14:03.665 --> 14:07.260
My spies whisper
but cannot substantiate.

14:08.809 --> 14:11.016
So you have her print,
but you don't have her?

14:11.816 --> 14:13.270
Mr. Tskalikan.

14:13.370 --> 14:16.829
The keepers traced the print
to a medical clinic.

14:16.929 --> 14:19.309
They're eliminating every lead.

14:19.582 --> 14:24.375
We have a name. Dunlevy.
Katherine Dunlevy.

14:25.408 --> 14:28.966
Well, I want miss Dunlevy found...

14:29.066 --> 14:31.054
and I want her dead.

14:32.163 --> 14:35.630
Black. Classic? A la mode, a la m... No.

14:36.131 --> 14:37.500
Katherine, I'm done.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.058
Jupiter! Help, please?

14:40.159 --> 14:44.397
- Wow, what's the occasion?
- Austin Davis is taking me to dinner.

14:44.497 --> 14:47.687
- I think he's gonna ask me to marry him!
- Do you wanna marry him?

14:48.087 --> 14:51.360
Jupiter, he's the number eight richest
bachelor under thirty in America.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.231
He speaks fluent Chinese and German,

14:53.331 --> 14:56.370
and he was an alternate
on the olympic curling team.

14:56.470 --> 14:59.710
- Solid résumé.
- Yeah, I mean, it sounds totally...

14:59.810 --> 15:02.029
- ...Cinderella, doesn't it?
- Sure.

15:02.348 --> 15:05.262
Then why do I feel like
I'm about to throw up? Oh, God.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.062
I just don't remember
Cinderella puking.

15:09.462 --> 15:11.950
Kind of remember her dancing
with a bunch of mice.

15:14.227 --> 15:17.995
Have you ever...
fallen in love, Jupiter?

15:19.008 --> 15:23.273
You know, my mom says that love
is just a fairytale for little girls.

15:23.373 --> 15:28.134
That really, it's all just urges
and obligations.

15:28.234 --> 15:30.295
Wow. That's kind of harsh.

15:30.395 --> 15:32.841
- You want my advice?
- Yes.

15:32.941 --> 15:34.710
If he's really in love with you,

15:34.811 --> 15:38.584
then he'll understand
that you're just overwhelmed and...

15:38.684 --> 15:40.087
and you need a little time.

15:40.188 --> 15:42.583
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

15:42.683 --> 15:44.430
Okay, what do I wear now?

15:44.530 --> 15:48.054
Something that reminds him
of what he is waiting for.

15:48.154 --> 15:52.678
Like that Red McQueen,
or this Little Ricci.

16:20.181 --> 16:22.169
Katherine? Everything all right?

16:22.269 --> 16:25.743
Yeah, no, no. We're good.
I'll be down in a sec.

16:42.023 --> 16:45.898
Picked up a referral. A townhouse.
But it has to be Wednesday.

16:45.998 --> 16:49.555
- Wednesday's full. Three houses.
- So do four.

16:51.525 --> 16:54.114
English, please.
We use English in this house.

16:54.215 --> 16:57.270
Use whatever you like.
You sound like Stalin to me.

16:57.371 --> 17:00.076
Stalin?! I'm Stalin?
You don't want the money.

17:00.176 --> 17:02.513
I will give it to... Gleb's crew.

17:02.914 --> 17:05.417
Good. Thank you.

17:05.636 --> 17:08.291
- We'll take it.
- Big surprise.

17:08.392 --> 17:10.829
Hey, cousin, speaking of money,
I was wondering if...

17:10.929 --> 17:13.940
Oh, let me guess. Another advance.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.358
For what this time? Shoes? A new phone?

17:18.460 --> 17:20.348
I'll earn it back.

17:20.448 --> 17:23.069
No, you mean you'll waste it
trying to make yourself feel better

17:23.171 --> 17:24.859
by buying something you don't need.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.666
So, what, instead of feeling better,
I should save my money and feel worse?

17:29.766 --> 17:32.738
Exactly.
Now, you're a smart girl, Jupiter.

17:32.839 --> 17:34.725
I admit it's none of my business,

17:34.825 --> 17:36.729
but that's probably the reason
you are not married.

17:37.804 --> 17:39.351
Men do not like smart women.

17:39.451 --> 17:41.054
You keep talking about
my daughter like that,

17:41.154 --> 17:44.767
I will ram that latke so far up your ass,
you won't crap for a week.

17:46.181 --> 17:47.083
English.

17:49.267 --> 17:51.008
Hey! Hey!

17:51.108 --> 17:53.496
You swore, no fighting at dinner.

17:53.796 --> 17:58.100
Jupiter, what is the money for?

17:59.372 --> 18:01.547
No, you're right.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.532
It's nothing I need.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.610
Hey, what was that about? You're not
having second thoughts, are you?

18:18.710 --> 18:20.047
What if I am?

18:22.039 --> 18:23.886
Jupiter...

18:25.807 --> 18:28.889
These people, they're counting on you.

18:28.989 --> 18:31.034
Have you even looked at this thing?

18:31.134 --> 18:35.079
Why do they have to use words
like "harvesting"? It's just creepy.

18:35.179 --> 18:38.347
Why would you read this?
You heard what the doctor said.

18:38.447 --> 18:42.507
It's not a big deal.
You go in, cash comes out.

18:43.307 --> 18:47.700
This money, I'm telling you,
I have real plans, serious plans.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.680
I believe this money's
gonna mean something...

18:50.780 --> 18:53.352
possibly life-changing for both of us.

18:59.289 --> 19:00.366
Okay.

19:02.536 --> 19:04.098
Okay.

19:04.498 --> 19:06.486
- You will not regret this.
- All right.

19:06.586 --> 19:08.005
- I promise. I promise!
- All right, all right.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.528
All right. Oh, wait, I have a question.

19:10.628 --> 19:14.001
Why is it that you get ten grand and
I get five? I mean, they're not your eggs.

19:14.501 --> 19:19.895
That's capitalism, babe.
Shit rolls downhill. Profits flow up.

19:51.294 --> 19:54.270
Ms. Dunlevy? Excuse me.

19:54.371 --> 19:56.575
You are Katherine Dunlevy, aren't you?

19:58.002 --> 19:59.321
The doctor's ready.

20:03.297 --> 20:06.669
- It's the hormones, dear.
- Don't worry. You'll be fine.

20:06.769 --> 20:10.317
Trust me, honey. I could do
this procedure with my eyes closed.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.163
No, no, no, no, no!
Please! Please, I can't!

20:12.263 --> 20:14.517
Just relax.

20:23.817 --> 20:27.793
I can't move my arms! What's happening?

20:28.754 --> 20:31.180
Get a sample.
Make sure this is the right one.

20:31.280 --> 20:35.340
Wait, wait. Please, please, stop.

20:36.176 --> 20:40.000
- It's her.
- Good. Kill her.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.283
Please, somebody...

20:43.506 --> 20:44.893
Oh, my God!

21:18.106 --> 21:20.194
You all right?

21:20.984 --> 21:23.952
- Who are you?
- Caine Wise. I'm here to help you.

21:54.142 --> 21:55.729
Pardon me, Lord Titus.

21:55.829 --> 21:58.318
Only good news is allowed
in here, Famulus.

21:58.518 --> 22:02.192
We received an FTL from Mr. Wise.
He says he has the girl.

22:02.692 --> 22:04.346
Brilliant.

22:04.446 --> 22:06.794
Then send the transport immediately.

22:06.894 --> 22:09.218
At once, My Lord.

22:21.462 --> 22:23.600
I thought it would make you
feel better when you woke up.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.228
- What?
- The gun.

22:25.328 --> 22:27.837
But it works better if you flip
the switch by your thumb.

22:29.962 --> 22:32.951
Careful. You've been asleep
for almost twelve hours.

22:34.804 --> 22:36.942
- Where am I?
- You're still in Chicago.

22:37.343 --> 22:39.280
Okay, good.

22:41.258 --> 22:43.154
My clothes?

22:43.254 --> 22:45.575
You were still in the paper clinic gown.

22:46.439 --> 22:48.481
Can't really think about that right now.

22:48.581 --> 22:52.873
Look, Jupiter... Is that your name?

22:53.273 --> 22:55.192
- How do you know?
- I'm sorry.

22:55.645 --> 22:57.582
I was just trying to figure out
what happened.

22:57.983 --> 22:59.632
You must have used
a false name at the clinic

22:59.732 --> 23:02.559
and their tests probably tripped
the monitor to your geneprint.

23:03.160 --> 23:05.743
What are you saying?
I mean, yes, I used a false name, but...

23:05.843 --> 23:10.006
lots of people do that in there. What does
that have to do with what happened to me?

23:10.506 --> 23:14.281
Okay. When I was in the legion,
they gave me protocols for this.

23:15.667 --> 23:20.859
It can be difficult for Terrsies,
or people from underdeveloped worlds,

23:20.959 --> 23:24.768
to hear that their planet is not the only
inhabited planet in the verse.

23:25.268 --> 23:28.608
It has to be the anesthesia.
I mean, it's gotta be a dream.

23:29.209 --> 23:32.717
Protocol actually says that most Terrsies
will say that this has to be a dream.

23:33.017 --> 23:35.906
Yeah, because a dream is the only way
any of this makes sense.

23:36.006 --> 23:40.682
Compared to what? The idea
that you're the only intelligent species,

23:40.782 --> 23:44.439
on the only inhabitable planet
in a universe so full of planets

23:44.539 --> 23:47.512
that you don't even have a number
to describe how many there are?

23:47.712 --> 23:51.269
- Are you saying you're an alien?
- Genomgineered human.

23:51.370 --> 23:54.310
They cut my DNA with the DNA
of something like a wolf.

23:54.410 --> 23:57.181
I'm a Lycantant,
bred for the military, but...

23:57.281 --> 23:59.185
that didn't work out for me.

24:00.323 --> 24:03.303
- And those things at the clinic?
- Keepers.

24:03.403 --> 24:06.142
They're from the Diorite system,
but they're genetically repurposed

24:06.242 --> 24:09.403
to act as monitors and watchdogs.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.714
And they're trying to kill me?

24:15.215 --> 24:17.553
- Yes.
- Why me?

24:18.053 --> 24:20.143
Please. This has to be a mistake.

24:20.942 --> 24:24.343
These people don't make
those kind of mistakes.

24:24.443 --> 24:28.207
What if I say no? What if...
I don't go with you? What if I go home?

24:31.297 --> 24:33.415
What? Are they gonna come
after me again?

24:37.575 --> 24:39.613
An FTL, My Lord.

24:40.313 --> 24:44.939
There was a problem at the clinic.
A former legionnaire was involved.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.493
A legionnaire?

24:46.703 --> 24:49.365
- What about the girl?
- Still alive.

24:50.566 --> 24:54.732
Double our security deployment.
Destroy any ship that comes near the planet.

24:56.478 --> 24:57.514
Go!

25:01.855 --> 25:03.175
Wow.

25:09.469 --> 25:12.622
- Are those flying boots?
- They use the force of gravity,

25:12.722 --> 25:15.969
redirecting it into deferential
equation slopes that you can surf.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.242
Yeah. I heard "gravity" and "surf."

25:20.557 --> 25:23.313
Up is hard. Down is easy.

25:23.513 --> 25:25.263
Thank you. Wow.

25:26.970 --> 25:29.576
Our ride's here. You ready?

25:29.976 --> 25:31.712
Ready?

25:31.812 --> 25:35.269
Ready to walk out of a hundred-story window
with you and your gravity boots...

25:35.370 --> 25:37.758
- ...onto an invisible spaceship to meet...
- This might make it easier.

25:37.858 --> 25:39.427
Okay.

25:46.975 --> 25:49.135
Sorry.

26:12.575 --> 26:13.707
Shit.

26:15.357 --> 26:17.222
Hold tight!

26:47.927 --> 26:49.809
Hold on!

28:31.527 --> 28:34.118
Whatever you do, don't let go!

31:41.894 --> 31:44.333
Look, I just need to know
what in the hell is going on here.

31:44.433 --> 31:48.039
Think we might have stumbled into a war
within the Abrasax family.

31:48.139 --> 31:49.308
The Abrasax family?

31:49.408 --> 31:51.712
It's one of the most powerful
dynasties in the universe.

31:51.813 --> 31:53.825
I don't care who they are.
You cannot just...

31:53.926 --> 31:56.209
blow up a bunch of buildings
and get away with it.

31:56.309 --> 31:58.377
Those buildings
will be rebuilt by tonight.

31:58.477 --> 32:00.580
That's impossible.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.839
Take a look.

32:07.262 --> 32:08.387
Holy crap.

32:10.716 --> 32:14.156
Wait, a bunch of people saw what happened.
I mean, they can't cover that up.

32:14.256 --> 32:17.731
You have a picture of a keeper on your phone
that you can't remember taking, can you?

32:19.629 --> 32:20.970
They blanked you.

32:21.070 --> 32:23.942
Short-term stuff is easy.
They won't get everybody,

32:24.043 --> 32:26.464
but no one ever believes the ones
that slip through the cracks.

32:26.564 --> 32:28.890
Oh, my God.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.605
Why is this happening to me?

32:31.866 --> 32:34.278
I asked Titus that question
before I took this job.

32:34.378 --> 32:36.283
All he'd tell me
is that it was personal.

32:36.383 --> 32:40.791
Look, this is ridiculous. I have never
even met this Titus, what's his name?

32:40.891 --> 32:45.245
Abrasax. The house of Abrasax
has three primary heirs.

32:45.345 --> 32:48.255
The oldest is Balem.
He's the one that controls this planet

32:48.355 --> 32:50.493
and is obviously the one
who wants you dead.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.432
That's insane.
I am telling you, I am nobody.

32:54.421 --> 32:57.991
Balem Abrasax wouldn't demolish
an entire city for a nobody.

33:00.078 --> 33:01.014
Kill her.

33:01.114 --> 33:04.860
Wait. Oh, my God! Stop!

33:24.843 --> 33:27.599
There you are.

33:31.968 --> 33:36.599
You know there are moments
when I actually miss you.

33:39.537 --> 33:43.797
But no one understands
this universe like you did.

33:45.298 --> 33:48.681
No one understands me...

33:50.141 --> 33:51.795
like you did.

34:06.806 --> 34:08.878
Mr. Tskalikan?

34:09.478 --> 34:12.902
How is it possible for a single splice

34:13.002 --> 34:16.109
to destroy an entire fleet of shadows?

34:16.509 --> 34:20.000
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake?

34:20.100 --> 34:23.092
They underestimated him.

34:23.193 --> 34:26.261
The next mistake...

34:26.561 --> 34:28.666
I hold you accountable.

34:36.197 --> 34:37.466
What are you doing?

34:37.565 --> 34:39.687
I just want the owner of this car
to know who borrowed it.

34:39.987 --> 34:42.242
We needed a low profile
to get out of the city.

34:44.106 --> 34:46.516
Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.808
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.
- Lucky for you...

34:50.909 --> 34:53.786
a woman owns this car.

34:56.353 --> 34:58.991
What is that? Is that a...

34:59.091 --> 35:03.934
Just... I wanna thank you...
for saving my life. I mean, I've...

35:04.034 --> 35:07.840
I've never been so scared
when I started falling...

35:08.810 --> 35:10.938
Then you were there, and...

35:13.603 --> 35:15.313
Do you do this sort of thing a lot?

35:17.063 --> 35:18.221
No.

35:18.930 --> 35:21.668
Then why did Titus hire you?

35:22.269 --> 35:25.726
Titus hired me because I'm good
at finding people.

35:27.396 --> 35:30.604
Are you taking me to him now?

35:32.005 --> 35:33.842
No.

35:42.992 --> 35:45.232
How do you know this guy?

35:45.981 --> 35:48.854
A long time ago, he was a friend.

35:50.958 --> 35:55.066
- What is he doing living way out here?
- He's a marshal for the Aegis.

35:55.166 --> 35:58.741
- The Aegis?
- They're like cops.

36:00.042 --> 36:02.549
Space cops. Sure.

36:15.238 --> 36:16.523
Stinger.

36:18.712 --> 36:21.216
Back from the goddamn dead.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.607
It's kind of funny, both of us
ending up on this planet.

36:26.211 --> 36:28.074
Funny ain't the word I'd use.

36:31.119 --> 36:35.251
- How'd you get out?
- Titus Abrasax. He hired me to lift her.

36:36.863 --> 36:39.207
Since Deadland ain't taught you
a damn thing...

36:40.637 --> 36:42.725
Just as I was getting used
to this life,

36:43.125 --> 36:46.683
you come back reminding me
what I flushed down the shitter for you.

36:56.909 --> 36:59.709
Where's Kiza? She used to at least listen
to my side of the story.

36:59.809 --> 37:01.871
You stay the hell away
from my daughter.

37:03.272 --> 37:06.171
Don't drag me
into your male mating rituals.

37:08.024 --> 37:11.647
- Hi. I'm Kiza.
- Hi.

37:11.747 --> 37:13.407
Jupiter. Nice to meet you.

37:14.501 --> 37:16.056
You used to have a little mettle
in you, kid.

37:16.156 --> 37:19.295
- I guess I'm getting a little old.
- Old? Look at me.

37:19.395 --> 37:21.405
Not a recode
or a drop of juice in years.

37:22.005 --> 37:23.687
You are a lot uglier than I remember.

37:26.872 --> 37:29.992
Hey! Hey!

37:31.319 --> 37:34.140
What is going on here?

37:58.788 --> 38:00.146
Your Majesty.

38:13.215 --> 38:14.968
Your Majesty.

38:16.729 --> 38:18.690
Thank you.

38:19.244 --> 38:22.012
I'll go to town to pick up
some groceries for dinner.

38:22.112 --> 38:24.884
- I'll go.
- I'm fine, Dad.

38:28.145 --> 38:30.967
Okay. All right.

38:31.067 --> 38:33.379
Let's have a look at you.

38:37.889 --> 38:39.064
It's not pretty, is it?

38:39.164 --> 38:42.000
Clipped and stripped. The mark
of a court martialed skyjacker.

38:42.339 --> 38:45.512
You still haven't answered my question.
Do you want your wings back or not?

38:45.913 --> 38:47.216
Wait, you had wings?

38:47.516 --> 38:51.603
The best bio-neural-synaptic prosthetic
the military could buy.

39:03.229 --> 39:05.926
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

39:06.026 --> 39:10.401
Your Majesty has no idea of the scientific
miracles that human beings are capable of.

39:10.928 --> 39:14.176
Why won't those human beings
share things like this?

39:14.276 --> 39:18.293
Sharing has never been the strong suit
of your species, Your Majesty.

39:18.393 --> 39:21.632
Okay, what is with this
"Your Majesty" thing?

39:22.032 --> 39:24.371
You've never been stung
by a bee, have you?

39:24.471 --> 39:25.429
No.

39:25.529 --> 39:30.382
You know, bees are genetically
designed to recognize royalty.

39:30.482 --> 39:32.269
Royalty?

39:32.669 --> 39:38.163
Well... You are in for a surprise
when you find out what I do for a living.

39:38.263 --> 39:43.384
Oh, it's not what you do.
It's what you are. They sense it.

39:43.484 --> 39:46.113
Bees aren't like humans.
They don't question or doubt.

39:46.713 --> 39:48.967
Bees don't lie.

39:52.725 --> 39:55.955
Oh, I... Sorry, I gotta take this.

39:57.156 --> 40:00.790
I'm guessing Titus
didn't say anything about it.

40:01.491 --> 40:04.499
No. Must have slipped his mind.

40:04.599 --> 40:07.103
Not easy to picture you
making a deal with a royal.

40:08.136 --> 40:10.659
Titus told me you were posted
to this planet

40:10.759 --> 40:14.684
and said if I helped him, he'd get you
your wings back, full reinstatement.

40:15.085 --> 40:20.212
- I figured I owed you.
- Yeah, you do.

40:21.313 --> 40:24.295
But if she is a recurrence...

40:24.395 --> 40:26.942
then this is a hell of a lot more
important than wings.

40:29.446 --> 40:32.685
<i>It's life changing, Jupiter!
Wait till you see this thing.</i>

40:32.885 --> 40:37.871
Two million pixels of resolution.
Everything I ever wanted.

40:40.149 --> 40:42.732
Yeah, no. That's great. Is mom there?

40:42.832 --> 40:46.846
No. She went out with Nino. Listen,
they were a little freaked out last night

40:46.947 --> 40:49.702
when you didn't come home,
but I covered. I think it's fine.

40:49.802 --> 40:51.623
How 'bout a little gratitude
for your cousin Vladie?

40:51.723 --> 40:55.462
I mean, this thing was a cakewalk,
right? Just like I said.

40:55.563 --> 40:58.995
- Easiest money we ever made. Cha-ching!
- It didn't happen.

40:59.968 --> 41:01.975
Didn't happen.

41:05.465 --> 41:07.687
- What?
- <i>No, I know. I'm so sorry.</i>

41:07.787 --> 41:09.691
- Oh, no.
- <i>I'm really, really sorry.</i>

41:09.791 --> 41:12.546
- <i>Why?</i>
- There was an accident at the clinic.

41:12.847 --> 41:14.851
<i>Someone got hurt.</i>

41:14.951 --> 41:18.032
Shit! I knew it!

41:18.132 --> 41:20.595
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I can't catch a break.

41:20.695 --> 41:24.095
- <i>I cannot catch a single break!</i>
- Look, Vladie, I'm with some people.

41:24.195 --> 41:26.089
- <i>I don't wanna be rude.</i>
- Wait, Jupiter, we have to reschedule.

41:26.189 --> 41:29.361
Totally. So, just tell mom I'm okay
and I will call her when I can.

41:29.461 --> 41:33.086
Wait, wait, wait! Jupe, Jupe...
I already spent the money.

41:33.919 --> 41:36.133
You're in trouble.

41:36.233 --> 41:38.328
You're in trouble.

41:40.199 --> 41:41.418
Don't touch my stuff!

41:47.763 --> 41:51.379
Balem ordered a blockade.
Nothing is getting on or off this planet.

41:51.479 --> 41:54.459
But Aegis command said
once her geneprint is verified,

41:54.560 --> 41:56.648
they'll get an injunction
to take us to Orous.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.178
- So we wait.
- They're sending a cruiser.

41:59.278 --> 42:00.795
- When?
- Should be here tomorrow.

42:01.606 --> 42:04.465
- We won't last the night.
- We need a plan.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.534
We need firepower.

42:06.634 --> 42:08.671
If she's what you say she is,

42:09.271 --> 42:11.359
we're not getting off this planet
without a fight.

42:11.459 --> 42:13.763
Stash is in the back.

42:17.220 --> 42:20.578
- Is he mad at me?
- When he's mad, you'll know it.

42:20.678 --> 42:22.648
He just...

42:22.748 --> 42:26.171
seems different since we got here.

42:30.045 --> 42:33.388
Caine is... complicated.

42:37.561 --> 42:40.850
He's a Lycantant without a pack.

42:41.986 --> 42:46.936
Had the bad luck to be born
half-albino. Runt of the litter.

42:47.237 --> 42:50.485
The splicer that bred him had to sell him
to the legion for a loss.

42:51.085 --> 42:54.325
But a Lycantant needs a pack.

42:54.626 --> 42:56.413
It's their center of gravity.

42:57.518 --> 43:01.950
Alone, usually they waste away and die,

43:02.050 --> 43:03.911
unless they become like him.

43:04.312 --> 43:06.937
Fearless. Relentless.

43:08.310 --> 43:11.199
Perfect hunting machines.

43:12.776 --> 43:16.202
Caine was the best soldier
I ever went into battle with.

43:17.603 --> 43:19.591
Why did he get court martialed?

43:21.139 --> 43:23.733
I'm sorry. If it's none of my business.
You don't have to tell me.

43:23.833 --> 43:27.097
Oh, he attacked someone.
He attacked an entitled.

43:27.497 --> 43:30.989
- He bit him.
- He bit him?

43:32.271 --> 43:33.561
Tore his throat out.

43:35.956 --> 43:39.396
There's something about the royals
for Caine. It's instinctual.

43:40.998 --> 43:45.032
They tried to put him down, but he was
under my command so I took the blame.

43:46.538 --> 43:50.016
Two scars across my back as a reward.

44:18.655 --> 44:22.496
You know, you both have marks on your neck,
but they're slightly different.

44:22.596 --> 44:25.211
The brand of the splicer.

44:25.311 --> 44:29.209
Marcellian Cahun was her name.
She loved bees.

44:29.809 --> 44:31.563
Wow.

44:32.063 --> 44:35.094
My father would be freaking out
right now.

44:35.194 --> 44:39.128
Do you know what this will do to people
when they find out the truth?

44:40.930 --> 44:44.188
I don't think that most people
would want to know the truth.

44:44.488 --> 44:45.841
I do.

44:48.017 --> 44:48.946
Okay.

44:49.046 --> 44:54.012
So, you've been taught that the birthplace
of the human race is earth, but it's not.

44:54.112 --> 44:58.125
It's actually a planet in the Cunabulum
system called Orous,

44:58.225 --> 45:01.070
a little over
a billion of your years ago.

45:01.171 --> 45:05.362
Your planet was discovered during what is
commonly called the great expansion.

45:09.068 --> 45:13.453
At the time, earth was inhabited
by a branch-species of Saurisapian,

45:13.853 --> 45:16.200
a dangerous human predator
called the Sargorn.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.999
Obviously before any colonization

45:18.099 --> 45:21.611
or resource development
could be done safely to your planet,

45:21.711 --> 45:25.216
a large-scale extinction event
was manufactured...

45:25.667 --> 45:27.104
Damn budget cuts.

45:28.640 --> 45:31.288
Are you talking about dinosaurs?

45:32.948 --> 45:36.623
Wait, are you saying your people
killed the dinosaurs?

45:36.823 --> 45:39.528
Technically,
they're your people, Majesty.

45:49.514 --> 45:51.325
Come on.

46:03.824 --> 46:08.696
According to commonwealth records,
this planet was seeded by Abrasax industries

46:08.796 --> 46:10.956
roughly one hundred thousand years ago.

46:11.206 --> 46:15.941
Human DNA spliced with indigenous
species to evolve a fertile population.

46:16.542 --> 46:19.405
And that's where the "why"
gets ugly. Basically,

46:19.505 --> 46:22.754
the goal is to grow a population
as large as possible.

46:22.854 --> 46:27.554
Once the population exceeds
the planet's ability to sustain it,

46:27.954 --> 46:31.289
it's considered ripe for harvest.

46:32.095 --> 46:33.403
Harvest?

46:35.503 --> 46:39.010
What's going on?
What's wrong with them?

46:39.610 --> 46:41.011
They're here.

46:41.111 --> 46:42.040
- Go.
- Come on.

46:42.140 --> 46:45.071
What? Caine? Wait, Caine!

46:46.195 --> 46:47.708
Caine!

47:24.647 --> 47:25.849
Beeswax.

47:27.870 --> 47:29.509
Gotcha.

49:38.072 --> 49:40.159
Mr. Night,

49:40.259 --> 49:42.831
I want this facility
running at capacity.

49:43.031 --> 49:46.971
I want full diagnostics and cost
projections for an early harvest.

49:47.071 --> 49:48.242
Of course, My Lord.

49:48.342 --> 49:50.914
What kind of grade
are we getting from the skim?

49:51.014 --> 49:52.818
Excellent product, sire.

49:53.118 --> 49:55.012
Premium grade.

49:55.889 --> 49:59.564
It's a... particularly robust stock.

50:01.784 --> 50:05.341
Assuming market stability,
if we harvest later this century,

50:05.441 --> 50:09.715
profit margins should eclipse
your nearest competitor.

50:11.736 --> 50:14.141
Understand this, Mr. Night.

50:14.964 --> 50:19.601
I will harvest that planet tomorrow

50:20.173 --> 50:23.231
before I let her take it from me.

50:27.284 --> 50:31.145
- Here we go.
- I trust you.

51:03.512 --> 51:06.426
Premium Abrasax, as requested.

51:15.894 --> 51:16.951
Now...

51:18.155 --> 51:21.071
Where is Her Majesty?

51:28.401 --> 51:30.423
<i>Good evening, Your Majesty.</i>

51:30.853 --> 51:33.946
<i>Allow me to assist.</i>

51:34.798 --> 51:37.402
<i>I am Sendi, your chamber presence.</i>

51:37.502 --> 51:40.858
- New clothes?
- <i>We wish only to attend your needs.</i>

51:40.958 --> 51:42.357
Where am I?

51:42.457 --> 51:45.601
<i>This is the Alcazar of Kalique Abrasax,</i>

51:45.701 --> 51:48.440
<i>second primary of the house of Abrasax.</i>

51:48.540 --> 51:53.039
- What's an Alcazar?
- A fancy way of saying my home.

51:53.733 --> 51:54.936
I'm Kalique.

51:56.097 --> 51:57.641
Jupiter Jones.

52:00.489 --> 52:02.952
I'm sorry for staring,
but it's really quite astonishing.

52:03.953 --> 52:05.323
What is?

52:06.687 --> 52:09.298
It will be easier to show you.

52:15.643 --> 52:17.997
Could this get any weirder?

52:18.998 --> 52:23.358
Imagine it for me. Meeting your mother
long after she's passed away.

52:23.558 --> 52:25.044
But I'm not your mother.

52:26.659 --> 52:30.322
Your planet is just now entering
its genetic age.

52:30.422 --> 52:35.181
You understand very little about something
which is a vital part of our reality.

52:36.432 --> 52:40.691
In our world, genes have
an almost spiritual significance.

52:40.791 --> 52:42.979
They are the seeds of our immortality.

52:44.330 --> 52:48.840
When the exact same genes
reappear in the exact same order,

52:49.355 --> 52:51.729
it is for us what
you would call reincarnation.

52:51.930 --> 52:54.274
But how could I be a reincarnation
of your mother

52:54.374 --> 52:55.946
unless your mother was from earth?

52:56.046 --> 52:58.442
My mother was born
before your first cities were built.

53:01.102 --> 53:04.177
Are you some kind of vampire race?

53:06.357 --> 53:08.378
We are the cause
of a lot of those myths,

53:08.478 --> 53:11.467
but I promise my mother
was just as human as you or I.

53:11.567 --> 53:14.974
The difference between us
is our knowledge and technology.

53:16.051 --> 53:18.547
How old do you think I am?

53:19.380 --> 53:20.668
Late forties?

53:21.317 --> 53:23.807
I recently celebrated
my fourteenth millennium.

53:25.043 --> 53:27.648
You're fourteen thousand years old?

53:27.748 --> 53:30.671
Fourteen thousand and four,
to be precise.

53:31.302 --> 53:35.363
My mother was approaching her ninety-first
millennium when she passed.

53:35.463 --> 53:37.791
You'd be just as amazed
how quickly it goes.

53:41.320 --> 53:45.416
If your lives are so long, could I ask you
how your mother actually died?

53:47.162 --> 53:48.831
She was murdered.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.694
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

53:52.695 --> 53:55.769
- Did they ever find out who did it?
- No.

53:56.270 --> 53:59.306
My mother and I
did not always get along.

53:59.406 --> 54:03.996
But I have a hope that this recurrence
might mean a second chance for both of us.

54:04.348 --> 54:08.735
Come. Let me introduce you
to the possibilities of your new life.

55:12.366 --> 55:13.564
Holy crap.

55:16.307 --> 55:19.574
Each of us has a code
for our optimal physical condition.

55:19.674 --> 55:23.839
The problem is our genes have an expiration
date which is transferred to our cells.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.993
A long time ago, someone figured out

55:26.093 --> 55:28.549
how to replace deteriorating
cells with new ones.

55:28.749 --> 55:31.120
Today, it's as easy
as changing a light bulb.

55:31.620 --> 55:34.877
- Where do you get these light bulbs?
- You grow them.

55:35.178 --> 55:40.053
- Like clones?
- No. Clones lack genetic plasticity.

55:40.153 --> 55:42.459
Several million years ago,
a gene plague caused by cloning

55:42.559 --> 55:45.314
nearly annihilated
the entire human race.

55:46.215 --> 55:49.856
I was told that the house
of Abrasax seeded the earth.

55:50.721 --> 55:51.926
Is that where you get it?

55:53.473 --> 55:58.062
Your earth is a very small part
of a very large industry.

55:59.540 --> 56:00.906
Feel my skin.

56:02.915 --> 56:04.418
Oh, wow.

56:04.618 --> 56:08.145
In your world, people are used
to fighting for resources,

56:08.246 --> 56:10.996
like oil, or minerals, or land.

56:11.096 --> 56:13.435
But when you have access
to the vastness of space,

56:13.536 --> 56:17.379
you realize there's only
one resource worth fighting over...

56:17.479 --> 56:20.056
even killing for...

56:20.423 --> 56:21.500
more time.

56:24.188 --> 56:28.280
Time is the single most precious
commodity in the universe.

56:33.027 --> 56:34.394
<i>Unidentified Lycantant.</i>

56:50.873 --> 56:54.714
So, sorry, I just don't understand what
you mean when you say, "claim your title."

56:55.114 --> 56:57.169
Well, it's common for people
in the first estate

56:57.269 --> 56:59.708
to leave a trust
for any potential recurrence.

57:00.716 --> 57:03.465
My mother wrote her future self
into her will.

57:04.266 --> 57:07.676
Right now, Balem owns the title
to earth, but...

57:07.776 --> 57:11.481
Once you claim it,
the earth will belong to you.

57:11.981 --> 57:15.301
How can one person own the earth?

57:15.401 --> 57:18.143
It's just a planet, Jupiter.

57:18.243 --> 57:21.483
In this world, people own things
far more valuable.

57:22.184 --> 57:23.535
You cannot know right now

57:23.635 --> 57:26.677
what it will be like when you're offered
wealth beyond your imagining.

57:26.877 --> 57:30.249
When you can choose
to remain young and beautiful,

57:30.349 --> 57:33.773
or when you can have the power to change
the lives of your family for the better.

57:33.873 --> 57:36.813
And all you have to do
is close your eyes.

57:51.441 --> 57:52.960
Caine?

57:53.060 --> 57:56.902
This must be The Hunter Titus hired.
Well-made, by the look of him.

57:57.002 --> 58:00.525
Whoa, no, no, no, no! Hey, hey!
It's okay. She's on our side.

58:00.625 --> 58:02.379
Abrasax don't know any side
but their own.

58:02.479 --> 58:05.668
Precisely.
And since Jupiter is an Abrasax,

58:05.768 --> 58:07.456
you can understand why
I helped her get off that planet.

58:07.556 --> 58:11.540
He has contacted the Aegis.
They are entering orbit now.

58:12.878 --> 58:14.903
Excellent.

58:15.003 --> 58:17.429
I had planned to take you myself, but...

58:17.529 --> 58:21.114
the Aegis will undoubtedly
insist they handle things from here.

58:23.670 --> 58:26.576
I wish for you the life
you've always dreamed of.

58:32.954 --> 58:35.493
Welcome aboard, Your Majesty.
My name is Diomika Tsing.

58:35.593 --> 58:38.154
- I'm the captain of this Aegis cruiser.
- Please, call me Jupe.

58:38.254 --> 58:39.969
Your Majesty.

58:40.269 --> 58:42.657
Stinger! You're all right!

58:42.757 --> 58:46.152
For the time being, Your Majesty.
The time being.

58:46.252 --> 58:48.435
We'll be escorting you to the commonwealth
ministry on Orous.

58:48.535 --> 58:51.056
If there's anything we can do to make
the journey easier, you let us know.

58:51.357 --> 58:53.279
Actually, you know what?
I'm feeling a little overdressed,

58:53.380 --> 58:56.634
so if you maybe have something
that I could change into?

58:57.234 --> 59:01.342
By myself. While I'm awake.

59:01.442 --> 59:02.478
What?

59:06.369 --> 59:10.259
No, no! Lord Balem!

59:10.359 --> 59:11.896
It was The Hunters!

59:11.996 --> 59:17.123
They betrayed you in the name
of your sister! Please!

59:17.223 --> 59:20.330
Mercy, My Lord! Mercy!

59:24.853 --> 59:27.276
Mr. Greeghan.

59:27.960 --> 59:30.132
Bring her to me.

59:30.832 --> 59:33.461
Yes, My Lord.

59:36.260 --> 59:39.415
Come in! I don't really...

59:39.516 --> 59:42.071
Oh, I don't really know how
to work this thing.

59:42.171 --> 59:45.449
Oh, hi. Come in.

59:45.549 --> 59:47.504
Your Majesty might want
to take a few of these.

59:47.604 --> 59:49.769
Portaling can be a little rough
on the royal bowels.

59:49.919 --> 59:53.076
Oh. Well, my bowels
are anything but royal.

59:56.428 --> 59:58.302
Thank you.

59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.959
You heard the lady down there.
You're an Abrasax now.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.596
No, no, I am a Jones.

01:00:03.696 --> 01:00:07.421
Well, except when I'm mad,
then I'm a Bolotnikov.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.748
If that's all you were,
you would not be on an Aegis cruiser

01:00:09.848 --> 01:00:11.566
headed to the hall of titles.

01:00:14.049 --> 01:00:15.937
Yeah.

01:00:16.037 --> 01:00:18.775
Stinger said that you attacked
an entitled once.

01:00:20.852 --> 01:00:22.882
- Stinger talks too much.
- Is it true?

01:00:22.982 --> 01:00:25.013
Does it matter?

01:00:26.852 --> 01:00:31.779
Sorry, I get it's none of my business.
I was just trying to understand.

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:36.693
Look, the truth is...
I don't know why I did it. I...

01:00:36.793 --> 01:00:39.599
I don't even remember doing it.
It just happened.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.792
We all do things we can't explain.

01:00:43.892 --> 01:00:48.598
They said it was... in my genes. A...

01:00:48.698 --> 01:00:51.662
defect of my genomgineering.

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:55.140
Could explain a lot of things about me.

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:59.939
Like the fact that I have
an uncanny ability

01:01:00.139 --> 01:01:03.112
to fall for men that don't fall for me.

01:01:04.012 --> 01:01:08.221
It's like my internal compass needle
points straight at Mr. Wrong.

01:01:08.722 --> 01:01:11.765
Maybe it's my genes.

01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:15.718
Maybe I have defective engineering too.

01:01:16.719 --> 01:01:19.075
And if that's the case...

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:21.647
is there any way to fix it?

01:01:23.408 --> 01:01:26.138
You are royalty now.

01:01:26.739 --> 01:01:30.263
I'm a splice. You don't understand
what that means, but...

01:01:30.463 --> 01:01:33.619
I have more in common with a dog
than I have with you.

01:01:33.719 --> 01:01:37.576
I love dogs, I've always loved dogs.

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:42.120
- I should go, Your Majesty.
- Right.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:46.028
- You need to strap in before we portal.
- Right, okay.

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:50.368
"I love dogs?"

01:02:26.447 --> 01:02:27.662
Welcome, Your Majesty,

01:02:27.762 --> 01:02:31.915
to the overpopulated, oozing cesspool
we humbly call "home."

01:02:43.271 --> 01:02:47.279
I did three tours in Abukesh, a battle
that cost the lives of two million soldiers,

01:02:47.379 --> 01:02:50.418
and I'd rather be back there than have
to deal with these bureaucrats.

01:02:51.118 --> 01:02:54.659
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I am intergalactic advocate Bob,

01:02:54.759 --> 01:02:57.888
here to assist you
through the ascension process.

01:03:05.909 --> 01:03:06.919
Sheave.

01:03:09.538 --> 01:03:13.813
This is the authentic recurrence
of her ladyship the Abrasax sovereign,

01:03:13.913 --> 01:03:16.368
and we have come to claim her title.

01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:19.924
You need to file
an inheritance petition,

01:03:20.024 --> 01:03:23.315
and if the title is held,
you'll need a transfer of title.

01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:25.774
Thank you.

01:03:27.924 --> 01:03:32.446
File a quit claim through central services,
section nine-eighteen. Next.

01:03:32.546 --> 01:03:37.158
You need a title survey and geneprint
identification from wills and trusts.

01:03:44.673 --> 01:03:49.366
Yeah, I can't touch this without
a tax number from the revenue review.

01:03:58.799 --> 01:04:03.358
This is revenue request,
not revenue review.

01:04:11.374 --> 01:04:14.197
We can't get the title
without the tax I.D.

01:04:31.763 --> 01:04:36.406
It goes without saying that graft
is incompatible with my programming.

01:04:38.711 --> 01:04:40.633
I think you dropped something.

01:04:42.851 --> 01:04:45.890
Press your thumb in the depression.

01:04:52.536 --> 01:04:56.193
Seals and signets
are on sub-thirty-three.

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:58.515
Your Majesty.

01:05:08.267 --> 01:05:10.992
Well, well, well, well.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:16.239
This is what I have to deal with.

01:05:39.577 --> 01:05:42.175
Oh, yeah.

01:05:48.595 --> 01:05:50.498
Yeah, very nice.

01:05:50.599 --> 01:05:54.105
Would Your Majesty kindly
place your wrist here?

01:05:54.205 --> 01:05:55.909
Yes.

01:05:56.009 --> 01:05:58.765
- Palm up, please.
- Sorry.

01:05:58.865 --> 01:06:01.396
Thank you. Thank you.

01:06:06.118 --> 01:06:08.125
Very good.

01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:10.059
Yes!

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:13.724
Okay.

01:06:14.745 --> 01:06:18.553
- It's cool.
- Very nice. Very, very nice indeed.

01:06:18.653 --> 01:06:23.797
Now, here is your code
and conduct guide

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:28.104
and your royal ways
and means commission.

01:06:28.572 --> 01:06:33.598
And file this with a legion administrator
for your royal guard appointment.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.168
- Yes?
- Okay.

01:06:35.468 --> 01:06:39.263
Well, congratulations, Your Majesty...

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:42.116
And my deepest condolences.

01:06:45.722 --> 01:06:46.908
Thank you?

01:06:48.728 --> 01:06:53.236
I will never complain
about the DMV... ever again.

01:06:53.336 --> 01:06:57.211
Well, you did it. It's official.
You are now entitled.

01:06:57.911 --> 01:07:02.632
Entitled to what?
Like, free parking? Key to the city?

01:07:02.732 --> 01:07:05.543
I mean, what does it even really mean?

01:07:05.694 --> 01:07:09.535
It means Your Majesty's life
is gonna change... if she wants it to.

01:07:11.038 --> 01:07:13.508
Can you say that again?

01:07:13.624 --> 01:07:16.714
Just the "Your Majesty" part.

01:07:17.445 --> 01:07:18.736
Your Majesty.

01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:22.059
That's interesting.

01:07:22.659 --> 01:07:26.967
When other people say it,
it makes me really uncomfortable.

01:07:27.068 --> 01:07:29.072
But when you say it...

01:07:29.799 --> 01:07:30.843
I don't know.

01:07:32.998 --> 01:07:35.769
I will admit there are things
about my life that I would like to change,

01:07:35.869 --> 01:07:38.004
but that doesn't make me
a different person. It doesn't...

01:07:39.693 --> 01:07:43.668
it doesn't change the things
that matter to me, or who I care about.

01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.071
I'm still the same me.

01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:51.615
If Your Majesty says so.

01:07:53.488 --> 01:07:56.058
Well, you're the one
with the entitled instinct.

01:07:56.458 --> 01:08:00.333
Is there something
happening to you right now?

01:08:00.433 --> 01:08:04.594
Does any part of you wanna bite me?

01:08:06.614 --> 01:08:07.659
No.

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:12.005
Well, maybe.

01:08:17.167 --> 01:08:18.496
Go ahead.

01:08:20.473 --> 01:08:23.227
How can Your Majesty be so sure...

01:08:23.327 --> 01:08:27.769
if, as you've said,
your "compass is broken"?

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.319
Tell me that I'm wrong.

01:08:31.421 --> 01:08:34.865
You used to work for Titus,
but that's not true anymore.

01:08:34.965 --> 01:08:37.939
So, why stick around?

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:40.540
Why help me?

01:08:45.367 --> 01:08:48.001
Because of Stinger.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.701
He thinks if we help you, then you might
help us get back in the legion.

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:57.393
- I see.
- Good to know we're both liars.

01:08:57.593 --> 01:08:59.209
What is this?

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:01.170
Sorry.

01:09:02.051 --> 01:09:03.715
Hello, Mr. Wise.

01:09:06.245 --> 01:09:09.398
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

01:09:15.715 --> 01:09:16.890
I'm sorry, man.

01:09:58.696 --> 01:10:01.216
Welcome, Your Majesty.

01:10:01.316 --> 01:10:03.988
I am Titus Abrasax,

01:10:04.088 --> 01:10:06.827
third primary of the house of Abrasax,

01:10:06.927 --> 01:10:11.000
and it is my profound honor...

01:10:11.939 --> 01:10:13.139
to meet you.

01:10:14.936 --> 01:10:17.475
You are aware that by detaining me
without consent,

01:10:17.576 --> 01:10:20.888
you are in direct violation
of statute twenty-seven-b-stroke-six.

01:10:21.688 --> 01:10:25.409
Your Highness is a quick study
of the entitled code, I see.

01:10:25.509 --> 01:10:27.958
I also know that I can file
a tax grievance against you

01:10:28.058 --> 01:10:30.606
unless you take me directly
where I want to go.

01:10:30.706 --> 01:10:33.478
I'd be delighted to take you
wherever you'd like.

01:10:35.711 --> 01:10:37.393
I'd like to go home.

01:10:38.919 --> 01:10:40.442
Very well.

01:10:40.772 --> 01:10:43.165
- Set a course for earth.
- At once, My Lord.

01:10:45.568 --> 01:10:48.594
In the meantime,
since you've invoked code and conduct,

01:10:48.695 --> 01:10:51.470
I trust you'll do me the honor
of dining with me this evening.

01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:54.292
Very well.

01:11:00.346 --> 01:11:02.269
The Aegis is involved now,

01:11:02.369 --> 01:11:04.790
more than likely
tracking you as we speak.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.628
- We've committed no crime.
- How 'bout detaining a royal?

01:11:08.761 --> 01:11:12.220
Her Majesty is... hardly detained.

01:11:12.521 --> 01:11:13.556
Where is she?

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.943
Dining with Lord Titus, of course.

01:11:27.198 --> 01:11:30.152
Unless they've moved on to dessert.

01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:41.106
Your Highness looks ravishing.

01:11:41.207 --> 01:11:43.596
What have you done with Caine?

01:11:43.696 --> 01:11:47.371
I know you do not trust me right now,
but I promise I am not your enemy.

01:11:50.502 --> 01:11:51.871
Please.

01:11:58.241 --> 01:12:01.835
Mr. Wise and I had an arrangement.
He broke our contract.

01:12:01.935 --> 01:12:04.170
For that, I promised
to return him to the Deadland.

01:12:05.869 --> 01:12:07.744
Is that open to negotiation?

01:12:08.345 --> 01:12:11.386
Everything is open to negotiation.

01:12:29.252 --> 01:12:32.141
I confess I feel I have you
at somewhat of a disadvantage.

01:12:32.241 --> 01:12:34.937
Is it because you kidnapped me?

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.001
From the moment I saw your geneprint,

01:12:37.101 --> 01:12:40.999
I knew so many things about you
because I was very close to my mother.

01:12:41.099 --> 01:12:44.765
So close, in fact, that I could tell
by the way she raised her eyebrows

01:12:44.865 --> 01:12:47.498
exactly what she was thinking.

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:51.745
At this point, I probably know more
about you than you know yourself.

01:12:52.446 --> 01:12:54.535
Well, shoot.

01:12:54.898 --> 01:12:58.484
Just like her, always expecting
the worst from people.

01:12:58.584 --> 01:13:01.247
Funny how often people exceed
those expectations.

01:13:01.347 --> 01:13:05.555
That distrust in others,
in the world and even in yourself,

01:13:05.655 --> 01:13:09.540
has made it difficult for you
to fall in love. Until now.

01:13:10.448 --> 01:13:13.855
You're in love
with Mr. Wise, aren't you?

01:13:13.955 --> 01:13:17.631
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this isn't love.

01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:21.360
All Mr. Wise wants from me
is to make him a legionnaire again.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.526
Mother was also a terrible liar.

01:13:24.826 --> 01:13:27.549
Your sister did tell me that you
would do anything in your power

01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:29.302
to prevent me from claiming my title.

01:13:29.402 --> 01:13:30.871
What makes you think Kalique
told you the truth?

01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:33.518
- Why would she lie?
- Kalique is in competition with Balem.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.510
She knows that the loss of the earth
will reduce his yield

01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:38.166
and impact his position in the market.
His loss is her gain.

01:13:38.266 --> 01:13:40.756
Same can be said for you.

01:13:43.959 --> 01:13:46.084
Not long ago, yes.

01:13:46.885 --> 01:13:49.273
- I would have been just like them.
- And now?

01:13:50.668 --> 01:13:54.300
I knew this moment would come
when your geneprint was first confirmed.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.288
I knew that when it did,
I was going to ask you one question,

01:13:57.388 --> 01:14:02.265
and if you gave me the right answer,
I was going to change my life, irrevocably.

01:14:06.106 --> 01:14:07.361
Come with me.

01:14:15.891 --> 01:14:17.355
What is that?

01:14:17.779 --> 01:14:21.903
It has many names.
Regenx, recell, nectar.

01:14:22.204 --> 01:14:24.425
There are various levels
of usefulness and quality,

01:14:24.525 --> 01:14:28.201
but this is the most pure
and most valuable solution

01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:30.368
made by the house of Abrasax.

01:14:30.468 --> 01:14:32.672
Kalique came out of a bath.

01:14:32.772 --> 01:14:37.499
Naturally, my sister didn't explain
what it is or where it comes from.

01:14:38.301 --> 01:14:40.888
It comes from people.

01:14:41.132 --> 01:14:45.164
Each unit is refined from approximately
a hundred human beings.

01:14:45.264 --> 01:14:46.216
What?

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:49.678
Your planet is a farm, Jupiter.

01:14:49.778 --> 01:14:52.952
There are thousands of planets like yours
set up by families like mine

01:14:53.052 --> 01:14:56.971
to supply an ever increasing
demand for more time.

01:14:59.373 --> 01:15:02.114
Are you saying you killed
a hundred people to make this?

01:15:02.214 --> 01:15:04.359
Not me, but...

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:08.073
yes, someone did.

01:15:08.448 --> 01:15:11.064
Not unlike butchering a herd of cattle.

01:15:13.886 --> 01:15:18.512
- Oh, my God.
- It's all right. It's all right.

01:15:19.013 --> 01:15:21.956
My mother went through a profound
change at the end of her life.

01:15:22.056 --> 01:15:24.407
She felt exactly as you do now.

01:15:24.507 --> 01:15:27.972
But when she tried to do something
to stop this business, she was murdered.

01:15:28.072 --> 01:15:30.004
I believe the same thing
is about to happen to me

01:15:30.104 --> 01:15:32.305
because I began to carry out
the work she started.

01:15:33.377 --> 01:15:35.865
That is why I hired Mr. Wise
to find you.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.118
I needed someone I could trust.

01:15:40.111 --> 01:15:42.491
I cannot allow my brother or sister
to end up with control

01:15:42.592 --> 01:15:45.672
over my part of the Abrasax inheritance.

01:15:45.773 --> 01:15:50.936
I want to know that when I die...
you will be my heir.

01:15:52.235 --> 01:15:54.801
Which brings us at last to my question.

01:15:58.084 --> 01:16:00.221
Jupiter Jones...

01:16:02.697 --> 01:16:04.204
will you marry me?

01:16:17.008 --> 01:16:18.805
A pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Apini.

01:16:18.905 --> 01:16:22.261
<i>I told your men not to take Caine.
You should have left him on Orous.</i>

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.907
Unfortunately, My Lord promised
Mr. Wise that if he betrayed us

01:16:26.007 --> 01:16:28.106
he'd be fed to the void.

01:16:28.206 --> 01:16:30.647
Titus Abrasax is a man of his word.

01:16:33.607 --> 01:16:36.646
- So was I.
- We got the trace.

01:16:37.547 --> 01:16:41.421
- Outside the Cleopeides.
- Better get a move on.

01:16:41.522 --> 01:16:43.935
Don't sound like Caine's
got a lot of time.

01:16:44.035 --> 01:16:45.476
Put him back in the brig.

01:16:56.584 --> 01:16:58.602
Lord Titus will see you now.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:06.083
You should have told me the truth
about why you wanted her.

01:17:06.184 --> 01:17:08.073
What good would that have done?

01:17:08.173 --> 01:17:12.705
If I did, then Jupiter would be dead
and Balem would still own the earth.

01:17:12.805 --> 01:17:14.837
Lies are a necessity.

01:17:15.037 --> 01:17:18.593
They are the source of meaning,

01:17:18.693 --> 01:17:21.876
of belief and hope.

01:17:22.877 --> 01:17:27.311
Honestly, lies are sometimes
the only reason I get out of bed.

01:17:38.448 --> 01:17:41.154
I'm particularly fond
of the lies we tell ourselves.

01:17:41.254 --> 01:17:42.848
Like the lie you are now concocting

01:17:42.948 --> 01:17:46.464
that somehow you'll survive
being tossed into the void

01:17:46.864 --> 01:17:48.900
and find some way to rescue Ms. Jones.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.709
You can't kill her. The title
will just remain with her family.

01:17:52.809 --> 01:17:55.915
Well, not once Her Majesty
and I are married.

01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:50.104
<i>Emergency pressurization complete.</i>

01:18:56.733 --> 01:19:00.106
<i>You have thirty-seven minutes
of air remaining.</i>

01:19:02.009 --> 01:19:05.950
<i>Please get to an airlock
or life pod immediately.</i>

01:19:08.666 --> 01:19:11.336
- You did what?! Shame on you!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:19:11.436 --> 01:19:17.357
You're telling me you convinced
your cousin to sell her eggs? Yeah?

01:19:17.507 --> 01:19:20.279
What the hell do you think she is,
a goddamn chicken?

01:19:20.379 --> 01:19:22.637
- Vassily, that's enough!
- Dad, Dad! She wanted to do it!

01:19:22.737 --> 01:19:25.577
She wanted to do it.
It wasn't all my plan!

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:27.643
- You little shit, Vladie!
- She begged me.

01:19:27.744 --> 01:19:30.795
She wanted to buy some stupid telescope.
The deal wasn't even very good for me.

01:19:30.895 --> 01:19:34.055
- Telescope?
- It's a curse. Our family is cursed.

01:19:34.156 --> 01:19:38.364
I don't care what she wanted!
You don't treat your cousin like chicken!

01:20:15.384 --> 01:20:18.026
You're the mother.

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:24.278
Be gentle with this one.

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.622
<i>You have zero minutes of air remaining.</i>

01:20:28.722 --> 01:20:31.747
<i>Carbon dioxide levels at maximum.</i>

01:20:31.847 --> 01:20:35.901
<i>Please get to an airlock
or life pod immediately.</i>

01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:48.844
- Is he alive?
- A few ticks later and he wouldn't be.

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:51.589
He's gonna kill her.
He's gonna kill her!

01:20:57.549 --> 01:20:58.685
Is there a problem?

01:20:58.785 --> 01:21:01.674
No, I'm so sorry,
I don't think I can do this.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:04.864
I told you not to think about it
like a wedding on your world.

01:21:04.964 --> 01:21:08.287
It's just a contract
in order to protect people.

01:21:08.387 --> 01:21:09.726
- Innocent people.
- I know, I get that, I do.

01:21:09.826 --> 01:21:12.662
I wish I could show you
the four small planets I inherited.

01:21:12.762 --> 01:21:16.837
Nothing as large as your earth, but each
unique and beautiful in its own way.

01:21:16.937 --> 01:21:19.151
I'd love to see them one day, but...

01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:23.335
Right now, I need to speak to Caine.

01:21:23.435 --> 01:21:24.964
I see.

01:21:25.064 --> 01:21:28.614
You still don't trust me.
Even though you trust the man I hired.

01:21:30.179 --> 01:21:34.304
I'm sorry, but talking to Mr. Wise
is no longer possible.

01:21:34.404 --> 01:21:35.423
Why?

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:38.512
He attacked a servitant
and destroyed a host of guards.

01:21:38.613 --> 01:21:41.802
Given his history, I was advised
to return him to the authorities.

01:21:41.902 --> 01:21:44.287
You do know what he did, don't you?

01:21:45.924 --> 01:21:47.633
And you still trust him.

01:21:48.481 --> 01:21:50.969
Beauty and her beast.

01:21:51.069 --> 01:21:53.849
Why wouldn't you tell me sooner?

01:21:54.794 --> 01:21:56.596
So you can plead for this.

01:21:56.696 --> 01:21:58.667
The original rite of pardon
and reinstatement

01:21:58.767 --> 01:22:00.997
my lawyers procured for him
and Mr. Apini.

01:22:01.098 --> 01:22:05.221
I kept it, knowing how you felt,
even if you wouldn't admit it.

01:22:07.768 --> 01:22:11.342
To be fair, there was a time when I would
have used something like this against you.

01:22:12.343 --> 01:22:14.385
But now if you can believe
anything, Jupiter,

01:22:14.485 --> 01:22:17.347
you can believe that the life
of one splice matters very little to me

01:22:17.447 --> 01:22:20.492
compared to the lives of my subjects.

01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:28.684
Goodbye, Miss Jones.

01:22:31.764 --> 01:22:33.586
Titus.

01:22:37.308 --> 01:22:38.549
I'll do it.

01:22:40.129 --> 01:22:42.384
Thank you.

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:51.720
I need your help.

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:54.709
Sure you want to go into a fight
with someone you can't trust?

01:22:54.809 --> 01:22:57.465
Has anyone in your crew ever
broke through a field of warhammers?

01:23:00.103 --> 01:23:02.108
What happened?

01:23:02.958 --> 01:23:07.358
Kiza's got the bug.
Couldn't afford the recode.

01:23:07.724 --> 01:23:09.778
I love my daughter, Caine.

01:23:09.878 --> 01:23:12.962
She's the only good thing
I've done with this life.

01:23:14.762 --> 01:23:17.487
You would have done the same.

01:23:17.787 --> 01:23:19.841
Are there any other family issues
that I should know about?

01:23:19.941 --> 01:23:22.396
- No.
- Loans?

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:24.666
Money problems?

01:23:25.128 --> 01:23:28.306
- No.
- He's good. Let's go.

01:23:54.557 --> 01:23:55.602
Holy crap.

01:24:00.778 --> 01:24:04.512
Portal at mass. Nine ticks to intercept.

01:24:29.559 --> 01:24:32.766
<i>Abrasax clipper D-gamma-nine,
this is the Aegis.</i>

01:24:32.866 --> 01:24:35.751
<i>Cut your engines
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

01:24:43.762 --> 01:24:47.489
The Aegis are demanding to board, sire.

01:24:48.988 --> 01:24:52.394
Do what you must,
but keep them off this ship.

01:24:57.010 --> 01:24:59.087
Warhammers are launching.

01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:11.537
Here we go.

01:25:16.015 --> 01:25:18.152
Your Highness.

01:25:18.828 --> 01:25:21.476
- Who are all these people?
- Just Sims.

01:25:21.576 --> 01:25:23.981
A necessary feature
for all royal weddings.

01:25:24.081 --> 01:25:29.325
As I told you, these are matters of state,
not of the heart. Shall we begin?

01:25:39.577 --> 01:25:40.717
Let's hit it!

01:25:46.239 --> 01:25:51.399
I, Titus Abrasax,
take Jupiter Jones to be my wife.

01:25:51.499 --> 01:25:55.865
I enter into this union being
of sound mind and of my own volition.

01:25:55.966 --> 01:26:00.809
Would my liege place his hand here
to receive the signifying bond?

01:26:11.572 --> 01:26:12.946
Break left, I'm going right!

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.828
I'm hit!

01:26:34.907 --> 01:26:36.220
Your turn.

01:26:36.821 --> 01:26:38.847
Where are you at, Stinger?

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.014
- I've lost a wing plate!
- I got you!

01:26:47.066 --> 01:26:48.202
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:58.513
I, Jupiter Jones,

01:26:58.613 --> 01:27:01.587
take Titus Abrasax to be my husband.

01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:16.482
"I enter into this union being..."

01:27:17.483 --> 01:27:21.047
I enter into this union...

01:27:21.323 --> 01:27:25.707
being of sound mind...
and of my own volition.

01:27:35.852 --> 01:27:37.597
We're clear!

01:27:40.794 --> 01:27:45.671
Would Your Majesty place her hand here
to receive the signifying bond?

01:27:48.811 --> 01:27:51.975
I'm tracking heavy SIM activity.
That's gotta be where she is.

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:01.025
Cover me!

01:28:08.073 --> 01:28:11.388
What's going on? What was that?

01:28:12.768 --> 01:28:13.755
No.

01:28:28.119 --> 01:28:29.870
Caine?

01:28:33.212 --> 01:28:37.932
Mr. Wise, you are as resourceful
as promised.

01:28:38.032 --> 01:28:41.311
This whole thing was nothing but a lie.

01:28:41.529 --> 01:28:44.703
- Was the ring executed?
- No.

01:28:44.803 --> 01:28:48.709
Once you were married
he was going to murder you.

01:28:48.809 --> 01:28:51.481
He told me right before
he threw me out the airlock.

01:28:54.103 --> 01:28:58.562
Honestly, I don't believe my mother
was ever as beautiful,

01:28:59.563 --> 01:29:01.602
or as gullible as you, my dear.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.466
May I kill him?

01:29:06.309 --> 01:29:08.340
Just get me out of here.

01:29:20.921 --> 01:29:23.793
- Your Majesty?
- Please, don't call me that.

01:29:23.893 --> 01:29:25.966
Titus will pay.

01:29:26.066 --> 01:29:29.623
- Captain Tsing has already filed...
- I don't care.

01:29:30.167 --> 01:29:32.053
The more you care,

01:29:32.153 --> 01:29:36.000
the more the world finds ways
to hurt you for it.

01:29:43.548 --> 01:29:47.055
That's your pardon. Congratulations.

01:29:47.155 --> 01:29:49.853
You and Stinger
are officially skyjackers again.

01:29:53.284 --> 01:29:55.023
Thank you.

01:29:56.563 --> 01:29:59.981
- When we were in the commonwealth...
- I don't wanna talk.

01:30:05.875 --> 01:30:09.038
I really just wanna go home.

01:30:17.998 --> 01:30:21.271
Mom? Oh, God, no. Nino?

01:30:21.371 --> 01:30:23.927
Good evening, Your Majesty.

01:30:24.027 --> 01:30:26.397
Easy, Dingo.

01:30:28.586 --> 01:30:29.988
Where's my family?

01:30:30.088 --> 01:30:34.596
Well, we can all only hope
that they remain unharmed.

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:40.993
I see you have the standard issue
Abrasax temper.

01:30:41.093 --> 01:30:42.914
A transfer of title
has already been processed.

01:30:43.014 --> 01:30:45.986
You and your Lord are trespassing
in this precinct.

01:30:46.086 --> 01:30:49.822
We are aware of all current legalities.

01:30:49.922 --> 01:30:52.782
I have been instructed
to offer your grace a proposal.

01:30:53.483 --> 01:30:56.845
- What proposal?
- You are to come with me to meet My Lord.

01:30:56.945 --> 01:31:01.489
They will abdicate your title

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:06.075
and in return My Lord guarantees
that he will do everything in his power

01:31:06.175 --> 01:31:10.417
to see that no harm comes to you
or your family.

01:31:10.517 --> 01:31:13.195
You can't do it, Your Majesty.
You cannot trust these people.

01:31:13.295 --> 01:31:16.911
If you abdicate, you'll have nothing
to protect yourself.

01:31:18.614 --> 01:31:20.903
You're going to kill them
if I don't come with you.

01:31:21.003 --> 01:31:24.961
Your Majesty, I could not even consider
such an abhorrent crime.

01:31:25.061 --> 01:31:27.984
- He's lying.
- You wound me, Mr. Wise.

01:31:28.084 --> 01:31:31.357
If I were trying to wound you, Mr. Night,
you wouldn't be breathing.

01:31:31.457 --> 01:31:34.796
If it makes everyone
feel warm and cozy,

01:31:34.897 --> 01:31:37.518
the Aegis is welcome to follow us.

01:31:37.618 --> 01:31:40.975
No. She won't be going
anywhere with you.

01:31:41.075 --> 01:31:46.102
Very well. I will inform My Lord
you have rejected his offer.

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:49.279
Wait.

01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:56.972
This is my family.

01:31:57.072 --> 01:31:59.093
It's too dangerous.

01:31:59.193 --> 01:32:01.201
I know...

01:32:01.301 --> 01:32:03.345
but it's not your decision.

01:32:15.158 --> 01:32:18.321
This is Greeghan, on approach.

01:32:18.421 --> 01:32:21.357
We have an escort.

01:32:24.108 --> 01:32:27.983
Mr. Nesh, keep us close.
Mr. Wise, that pacing's not helping.

01:32:28.478 --> 01:32:31.060
<i>The gate is prepped
and standing by, sir.</i>

01:32:35.369 --> 01:32:38.919
- Captain Tsing!
- They're closing the vortex! Shields up!

01:32:39.739 --> 01:32:41.691
Accelerate to full.

01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:51.266
- We've lost all Nav-com, Captain!
- Grav-drive not responding!

01:32:52.547 --> 01:32:54.032
Shields failing!

01:32:56.303 --> 01:32:58.337
Get us out of here, Nesh!

01:33:16.659 --> 01:33:17.778
Damn it.

01:33:57.956 --> 01:34:00.529
Where's my family?

01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:03.083
You should have stayed dead.

01:34:03.183 --> 01:34:05.388
I am not your mother.

01:34:05.888 --> 01:34:10.313
No, my mother
never cleaned a toilet in her life.

01:34:10.414 --> 01:34:13.085
Maybe that was her problem.

01:34:13.369 --> 01:34:15.957
My mother...

01:34:20.203 --> 01:34:26.895
My mother taught me what was necessary
to rule in this universe.

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:29.139
Like killing people?

01:34:30.028 --> 01:34:33.600
I create life!

01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.714
And I destroy it.

01:34:38.416 --> 01:34:40.120
Life...

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:44.618
is an act of consumption... Jupiter.

01:34:44.897 --> 01:34:47.351
To live...

01:34:47.451 --> 01:34:50.040
is to consume.

01:34:50.831 --> 01:34:55.568
Now the human beings on your planet
are merely a resource...

01:34:55.668 --> 01:34:58.945
waiting to be converted into capital.

01:35:00.243 --> 01:35:02.831
And this entire enterprise

01:35:02.932 --> 01:35:06.662
is just a small part in a vast...

01:35:06.762 --> 01:35:10.813
and beautiful machine
defined by evolution,

01:35:10.913 --> 01:35:14.956
designed to a single purpose...

01:35:17.692 --> 01:35:19.665
to create profit.

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.941
If that's what your mother taught you,
then I can see why you hated her.

01:35:27.343 --> 01:35:29.643
I loved my mother.

01:35:29.744 --> 01:35:32.256
And yet, you're trying to kill me.

01:35:33.357 --> 01:35:35.795
My mother...

01:35:36.496 --> 01:35:41.447
made me understand
that every human society is a pyramid

01:35:41.548 --> 01:35:45.714
and that some lives will always
matter more than others.

01:35:47.965 --> 01:35:51.024
It is better to accept this...

01:35:51.525 --> 01:35:55.064
than to pretend it isn't... true.

01:35:58.593 --> 01:36:00.240
Is that why you killed her?

01:36:01.523 --> 01:36:03.837
How dare you?!

01:36:22.233 --> 01:36:27.010
I know because of who and what you are,
you're unable to say this...

01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:30.093
so I'll say it for you.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:35.400
You lied in the commonwealth
because you're a Hunter...

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:39.384
who's been searching
for one thing his whole life.

01:36:40.185 --> 01:36:42.090
You survived so long without it,

01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:45.884
the fact that you may have
found it terrifies you,

01:36:45.984 --> 01:36:49.354
but not as much as the fact
that she's down there...

01:36:49.954 --> 01:36:52.360
buried in several tons of hurricane.

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.773
And if you wanna see her again,
then you take my advice...

01:36:56.873 --> 01:37:00.025
you get down there
and you start digging.

01:37:06.436 --> 01:37:08.307
This is a notice of abdication.

01:37:08.908 --> 01:37:11.864
You will confess
your genetic incapacity to rule

01:37:11.964 --> 01:37:14.887
and you will return the title
to its natural heir.

01:37:15.587 --> 01:37:16.963
Where's my family?

01:37:27.678 --> 01:37:29.645
Mom! Oh, God.

01:37:32.102 --> 01:37:36.110
I... I will do whatever
it is that you want,

01:37:36.210 --> 01:37:38.833
so long as the Aegis can get
my family out of here safely.

01:37:38.933 --> 01:37:41.923
You are in no position to negotiate.

01:37:50.304 --> 01:37:54.285
Stop. Stop, stop, stop!
I will do anything. Please, you win.

01:37:54.385 --> 01:37:57.018
I beg of you, stop. Please.

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:20.029
<i>Mr. Wise, as a matter of public record,</i>

01:38:20.129 --> 01:38:23.486
I must inform you that I strongly advise
against this reckless course of action

01:38:23.586 --> 01:38:26.557
that will almost certainly
cost you your life.

01:38:26.657 --> 01:38:28.461
Understood.

01:38:30.205 --> 01:38:34.105
Off the record, I will tell you
that you're a man of rare courage...

01:38:34.206 --> 01:38:35.946
and I pray your aim is true.

01:38:37.759 --> 01:38:39.158
Thank you.

01:39:41.218 --> 01:39:44.625
And hereby return the title
to its original heir,

01:39:44.725 --> 01:39:47.230
Balem Abrasax.

01:39:52.541 --> 01:39:55.129
Once I seal this...

01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:58.038
How long until you harvest the earth?

01:39:58.138 --> 01:40:00.940
I can promise that you will not see it.

01:40:01.441 --> 01:40:02.794
But how long?

01:40:04.195 --> 01:40:08.956
You knew nothing of harvesting before.
Why should it matter now?

01:40:09.356 --> 01:40:14.093
Remember why you're here.

01:40:18.324 --> 01:40:20.796
I came here to try
to protect my family.

01:40:21.797 --> 01:40:23.985
Seal that sheave,

01:40:24.085 --> 01:40:28.310
and you and your family
will return home safely.

01:40:35.089 --> 01:40:37.645
If I don't seal this...

01:40:39.363 --> 01:40:42.656
you can't touch the earth,
even if you kill me.

01:40:42.756 --> 01:40:44.607
Is that right?

01:40:44.707 --> 01:40:48.248
That planet belongs to me.

01:40:48.548 --> 01:40:50.162
It is my right.

01:40:58.050 --> 01:40:59.378
Not anymore.

01:41:00.671 --> 01:41:04.346
You have no idea what you're doing.

01:41:04.446 --> 01:41:08.630
I am making sure that whatever
you do to me and my family,

01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:11.420
you're not able to do to anyone else's.

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:14.357
This is not a game.

01:41:15.533 --> 01:41:19.008
I am not my brother or my sister.

01:41:19.108 --> 01:41:22.081
- If you do not seal...
- Beg pardon, My Lord.

01:41:22.181 --> 01:41:24.039
- Mr. Night!
- It is an emergency!

01:41:24.139 --> 01:41:26.281
The grav-hull is ruptured.

01:41:26.422 --> 01:41:29.408
The gas is reacting to the stock works.

01:41:37.142 --> 01:41:39.455
You seal it now.

01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:53.614
Seal it now!

01:42:06.850 --> 01:42:09.454
My Lord, is that advisable
without the abdication?

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:13.395
Kill her!

01:42:22.981 --> 01:42:25.274
Here, take this. Get your family out.

01:42:25.374 --> 01:42:27.217
Wait.

01:42:31.781 --> 01:42:33.720
In case we don't get the chance again.

01:42:36.473 --> 01:42:38.271
Go.

01:42:39.896 --> 01:42:44.318
I'm getting readings from the refinery.
It's destabilized. Sinking fast.

01:43:26.586 --> 01:43:29.142
- Captain, the gate's open.
- It's an evacuation.

01:43:33.568 --> 01:43:35.830
Get us down there, Nesh.

01:43:49.889 --> 01:43:53.709
You're just like her.
You won't pull that trigger.

01:44:09.971 --> 01:44:11.847
Jupiter!

01:46:56.175 --> 01:46:59.648
You hurt me.

01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:05.761
And I'm gonna make you regret it.

01:47:47.373 --> 01:47:50.652
- Captain, I'm tracking a ping.
- Is it Her Majesty?

01:47:50.752 --> 01:47:52.567
Signature unknown.
Attempting to lock in.

01:47:53.168 --> 01:47:56.809
This is Captain Tsing of the Aegis.
We are tracking. Can you click back?

01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:59.646
- <i>This is Caine.</i>
- Yes!

01:47:59.746 --> 01:48:03.437
<i>I have the family. Can you extract?</i>

01:48:53.418 --> 01:48:57.709
- Caine, we can't wait long!
- Give me every second you can.

01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:27.667
Is this familiar, Mother?

01:49:28.953 --> 01:49:32.269
Does some part of you
remember this like I do?

01:49:32.369 --> 01:49:35.553
Well, this is how it began!

01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:42.052
We were fighting.

01:49:42.663 --> 01:49:45.685
Do you remember what you said?

01:50:07.812 --> 01:50:11.128
I remember what you said.

01:50:15.827 --> 01:50:19.550
You told me you hated your life.

01:50:19.650 --> 01:50:21.654
It's the truth.

01:50:23.079 --> 01:50:25.432
And you begged me to do it.

01:50:28.267 --> 01:50:31.008
You begged me to do it!

01:50:31.708 --> 01:50:34.930
I am not your damn mother.

01:51:23.591 --> 01:51:26.484
Jupiter. Just breathe.

01:51:26.714 --> 01:51:28.726
Just breathe.

01:51:29.887 --> 01:51:32.519
- My family?
- They're safe.

01:51:39.374 --> 01:51:41.349
- Medic!
- We can't hold much longer!

01:51:41.449 --> 01:51:43.984
Set a portal. Now!

01:51:44.084 --> 01:51:46.139
Captain, I don't need to tell you
how dangerous it is to...

01:51:46.239 --> 01:51:49.737
Then don't!
I promised every second I could.

01:51:55.635 --> 01:51:57.132
Oh, no.

01:52:13.968 --> 01:52:17.684
- Twelve ticks to portal.
- Eruption imminent!

01:52:30.083 --> 01:52:32.924
- Portal's open!
- Come on, Caine.

01:52:39.221 --> 01:52:41.627
Core-gen's about to blow!

01:52:53.671 --> 01:52:54.481
Now!

01:53:05.514 --> 01:53:09.089
- Everyone all right?
- Aye, Captain.

01:53:10.759 --> 01:53:14.869
Captain, I don't understand,
but I'm pinging Mr. Wise again.

01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:17.659
What?

01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:22.403
- <i>Hello in there.</i>
- Wise, where are you?

01:53:22.503 --> 01:53:24.758
<i>Why don't you take a look
out your window?</i>

01:53:26.230 --> 01:53:28.801
<i>You might want to open the door
for us or something.</i>

01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:58.351
Jupiter.

01:53:58.452 --> 01:54:02.710
Jupiter, get up. Make the coffee.

01:54:09.043 --> 01:54:11.028
Morning, Nino.

01:54:15.706 --> 01:54:17.164
Morning, mama.

01:54:40.546 --> 01:54:43.449
- Jupiter.
- Yeah?

01:54:44.188 --> 01:54:47.179
- Need help?
- All done.

01:54:49.114 --> 01:54:52.373
- Big moment.
- English, please.

01:54:52.473 --> 01:54:54.374
Vladie.

01:54:54.774 --> 01:54:57.134
Look, Jupiter...

01:54:57.334 --> 01:55:00.491
I know we don't always see eye to eye.

01:55:01.227 --> 01:55:03.216
But...

01:55:03.651 --> 01:55:06.873
- well...
- For you, my dear.

01:55:08.628 --> 01:55:10.848
Why, you guys?
It's not even my birthday.

01:55:10.949 --> 01:55:13.388
Vladie told us what you wanted
the money for.

01:55:13.488 --> 01:55:16.878
You didn't. No.

01:55:18.182 --> 01:55:20.486
Are you serious?

01:55:22.391 --> 01:55:24.312
Oh, my God.

01:55:25.214 --> 01:55:26.501
Oh, my God.

01:55:26.601 --> 01:55:29.050
- We all pitched in.
- Thank you.

01:55:29.150 --> 01:55:31.379
Your father was good man...

01:55:31.479 --> 01:55:34.602
and I loved him very much.

01:55:35.404 --> 01:55:38.176
And you should have this.

01:55:38.478 --> 01:55:41.108
Could we take it up to the roof?

01:55:42.527 --> 01:55:44.135
I'm so sorry. I...

01:55:44.892 --> 01:55:46.896
- I actually have a date.
- What?!

01:55:47.932 --> 01:55:49.670
- Is he Russian?
- Is he rich?

01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:51.879
- Does he have a younger brother?
- Does he need a big television?

01:55:51.979 --> 01:55:53.461
- How is he with a mop?
- What's his name?

01:55:53.561 --> 01:55:57.872
- More importantly, what's his sign?
- I don't know.

01:56:03.184 --> 01:56:07.260
I guess you can say my family's complicated
the way that most families are complicated.

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:11.368
- You think you'll ever tell them?
- What, that I own the earth?

01:56:12.655 --> 01:56:14.697
Are you kidding me?
They'd have me locked up.

01:56:15.197 --> 01:56:17.113
And I wouldn't blame them either.

01:56:17.213 --> 01:56:21.174
Besides... I'm still trying to understand
exactly what it means myself.

01:56:21.425 --> 01:56:23.435
Well, maybe it just means
that Your Majesty's planet

01:56:23.535 --> 01:56:26.437
has a different future than the one
that was planned for it.

01:56:28.807 --> 01:56:30.006
Say that again.

01:56:31.376 --> 01:56:34.638
You mean... "Your Majesty"?

01:56:36.235 --> 01:56:38.233
That really works for me.

01:56:38.333 --> 01:56:40.936
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:56:41.036 --> 01:56:43.194
All right.

01:56:43.294 --> 01:56:45.395
Come on.

01:56:53.481 --> 01:56:55.659
That ain't bad either.

01:57:08.698 --> 01:57:10.487
Well, I can get used to this.

01:57:26.806 --> 01:57:29.045
You ready?

01:57:29.145 --> 01:57:30.906
Watch this.
