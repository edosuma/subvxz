WEBVTT

00:05.738 --> 00:09.307
Oh, man,
I can't believe it.
What's the matter?

00:09.374 --> 00:12.543
I still haven't reached
my fundraising goal
for the library.

00:12.612 --> 00:15.814
Where am I gonna get
another thousand dollars?

00:15.881 --> 00:20.318
Well, you could pay the fine
on that library book I've
had out for seven years.

00:20.385 --> 00:23.855
I'm almost done with it.

00:23.923 --> 00:26.925
If I could just reach
this fundraising goal

00:26.993 --> 00:28.693
I'd be out of the fundraising
business forever.

00:28.761 --> 00:32.631
No more kissing up to people,
planning stupid events.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.532
I'd be a whole
different person.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.936
Forget the book,
I got the grand right here.

00:38.004 --> 00:40.238
What's that
supposed to mean?

00:40.305 --> 00:42.273
Honey, snookums.

00:42.341 --> 00:44.909
Loverbuns, come on.

00:44.977 --> 00:47.578
This fundraising
doesn't actually
bring out the best in you.

00:47.647 --> 00:50.481
You've been almost as unbearable
as you were during childbirth.

00:50.549 --> 00:53.051
I'd like to see how pleasant
you'd be giving birth.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.286
Hey. I'd be huge giving birth.

00:55.354 --> 00:57.455
Cracking jokes,
doing impressions.

00:57.523 --> 01:01.059
"look, sumo man.
Look at me, look at me."

01:01.127 --> 01:04.428
I would cut the umbilical cord
with binford 6100
hedge clippers.

01:04.495 --> 01:06.631
<i>(chopping sounds)</i>

01:06.699 --> 01:11.435
Great way for baby to begin
life, seeing you coming
at him with hedge clippers.

01:11.503 --> 01:14.739
Hey, come on, help me out.
Where am I gonna get this money?

01:14.807 --> 01:17.709
Have a bake sale.
Get your cupcakes to everybody.

01:17.777 --> 01:21.579
Once the nausea sets in,
just grab their wallet.

01:21.647 --> 01:24.282
How do you think I got
the last thousand?

01:24.349 --> 01:26.851
Know how they have those
studly celebrity auctions?

01:26.919 --> 01:28.452
We could do that
on <i>tool time.</i>

01:28.520 --> 01:30.288
Sure.

01:30.355 --> 01:33.224
People would pay a lot of money
to have a handsome tool guy stop
by and fix stuff.

01:33.292 --> 01:35.727
Do you think al
would do that?

01:38.030 --> 01:40.298
You auction me off,
you raise all the money
you need for the library,

01:40.365 --> 01:43.601
Have money left over for
a turbocharged four-wheel
drive bookmobile.

01:43.669 --> 01:47.005
Why would the library need
a turbocharged bookmobile?

01:47.073 --> 01:49.373
Speed reading courses.

03:01.046 --> 03:03.148
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:09.989 --> 03:12.590
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor,

03:12.658 --> 03:14.993
And you all know my
assistant, al borland.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.061
<i>(applause)</i>

03:19.064 --> 03:20.899
Well, today's your chance

03:20.966 --> 03:23.802
To take home tv's top tool man
for an entire day.

03:23.869 --> 03:25.904
That's right.

03:25.971 --> 03:30.241
One lucky bidder will
be able to take home... Me.

03:30.309 --> 03:34.879
I should mention that it's
for a very worthy cause.

03:34.947 --> 03:38.683
Let's bring out our guest
auctioneer with a big round
of applause.

03:38.750 --> 03:43.454
This woman's enjoyed my tool
expertise for the last 15 years.

03:43.522 --> 03:46.457
Big warm <i>tool time</i> welcome
for jill "the tool wife" taylor!

03:46.525 --> 03:48.960
Honey, come on.

03:55.167 --> 03:58.602
Thank you. I should mention
that all the proceeds
from the auction today

03:58.670 --> 04:01.372
Go to the detroit
public library.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.107
Should we start the bidding?
Yeah.

04:03.175 --> 04:04.442
Actually, before you
start the bidding,

04:04.509 --> 04:06.811
I have a surprise entry
for the auction.

04:06.879 --> 04:10.548
Surprise?
Yes. I think it'll
bring in quite a tidy sum.

04:10.615 --> 04:13.985
Let's have a warm welcome
for the tool man that needs
no introduction.

04:14.053 --> 04:17.721
The grand master of tools,
mr. Bob vila.

04:35.507 --> 04:38.743
Bob vila!
This is so exciting.
I'm bursting.

04:38.810 --> 04:41.346
Hi, tim.
Hey, bob.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

04:41.413 --> 04:43.414
This is tim's
lovely wife, jill.

04:43.482 --> 04:46.817
Hello. Nice to meet you.
It's a thrill.
Likewise. It's a pleasure.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.753
Bob, what brings
you to detroit?

04:48.820 --> 04:52.423
I just showed my hot rod
at the custom car show
over at cobo hall.

04:52.491 --> 04:55.126
You built a hot rod?
Actually, I had it
built by some experts.

04:55.194 --> 04:58.229
I built my own.

04:58.297 --> 05:00.365
That's nice, tim.
But mine actually runs.

05:04.736 --> 05:07.005
Could we...?

05:08.640 --> 05:11.242
Tool show?
Cable television?
Sorry.

05:11.310 --> 05:15.446
Right. Why don't we start
our auction off by bidding
on our good friend bob vila?

05:15.514 --> 05:18.049
Step up here, bob.
Ok.

05:18.117 --> 05:22.486
Please bear with my wife,
this is the first time she's
ever been an auctioneer.

05:25.958 --> 05:29.227
I'm gonna open the bidding
at one hundred dollars.

05:29.295 --> 05:30.528
One hundred dollars.

05:30.595 --> 05:34.899
I got a hundred, do I hear
a hundred and a quarter?

05:34.967 --> 05:37.969
Two hundred.
Two hundred from
the lady in the denim.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.870
Do I hear three hundred,
three hundred?

05:39.939 --> 05:43.541
Talk to me, talk to me,
swing, batter, swing.

05:43.608 --> 05:45.876
Come on, people.
Stop sitting on your hands.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.546
This is big bob vila,
the man who's the reason

05:48.613 --> 05:50.848
Why men like my husband
have a job.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.787
Seven hundred.
Woohoo!
Seven hundred!

05:56.855 --> 05:58.990
Seven hundred,
seven hundred,
seven hundred,

05:59.058 --> 06:01.259
Going once,
going twice...

06:01.327 --> 06:04.996
Sold for seven hundred
smackeroonies to the man
with the wonderful smile.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.797
Hope you're very happy
with your tool man.

06:13.538 --> 06:15.739
I'm telling you,
seven hundred dollars...

06:15.807 --> 06:19.410
Seven hundred dollars
is a lot of money,
but he is worth it.

06:19.478 --> 06:24.882
Petty cash. Wait till you see
what I go for. Sit down, bob.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.118
All right,
ladies and germs,

06:27.186 --> 06:30.721
You now have the chance to bid
on the toast of <i>tool time,</i>

06:30.789 --> 06:33.291
The host of <i>tool time,</i>
tim "the tool man" taylor.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.626
I'll open the bidding
at one hundred dollars.

06:35.694 --> 06:39.330
A hundred, a hundred,
a hundred...
A hundred.

06:39.398 --> 06:43.801
A hundred dollars! Do I hear
two hundred dollars,
two hundred, two hundred?

06:43.869 --> 06:47.405
Just remember this man
will do to your house what
he does here every day.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.308
Maybe we should auction
off some homeowners'
insurance first.

06:53.545 --> 06:55.046
Come on, people,
I got a hundred dollars.

06:55.114 --> 06:58.816
Do I hear one-fifty,
one-fifty, one-fifty?

07:04.223 --> 07:07.225
Guy in the back.
Two hundred, he says.
I didn't see a hand.

07:07.292 --> 07:09.793
He's got gloves on.
Ok, we have two hundred.

07:09.861 --> 07:12.863
Do I hear three hundred?
Somebody give me three hundred.

07:12.931 --> 07:15.366
Anybody give me three hundred,
anybody, anybody.

07:17.102 --> 07:19.670
Nobody.

07:19.738 --> 07:21.906
All right.
I bid three hundred dollars.

07:21.973 --> 07:23.641
You can't bid,
you're the auctioneer.

07:23.708 --> 07:27.211
It's my auction
and I'll bid if I want to.

07:27.279 --> 07:30.915
Three hundred dollars.
Going once, going twice.

07:30.982 --> 07:33.551
Going home with me
for three hundred dollars.

07:33.618 --> 07:37.121
Wait, you put the gavel down
too fast. The guy in the back.
Speak up, sir.

07:37.189 --> 07:40.458
How can I get tickets
to bob vila's show?

07:44.897 --> 07:46.997
Hi, guys,
I'm home.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.202
I said I'm home.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.803
How'd the auction go?

07:52.871 --> 07:55.873
Put a gavel in my hand,
I come alive.

07:55.941 --> 07:57.575
So, did you raise
a lot of money?

07:57.642 --> 08:00.211
We raised all of it.
It was great.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.713
Bob vila showed up
and the bidding went wild.

08:02.781 --> 08:04.182
How'd dad do?

08:04.249 --> 08:07.485
Good. Real good.

08:07.553 --> 08:12.022
In fact, he was bought
by a very attractive woman.

08:13.525 --> 08:15.526
How much did you pay for him?

08:18.564 --> 08:20.598
Doesn't matter how
much I paid for him.

08:20.665 --> 08:22.433
How much did
bob vila go for?

08:22.501 --> 08:25.269
It's not important.

08:25.337 --> 08:28.038
Vila kicked his butt, huh?

08:29.174 --> 08:31.576
You might say that.

08:31.643 --> 08:34.945
Just don't say it
in front of your father.
And I mean it, randy.

08:35.013 --> 08:36.313
Hi, guys.

08:41.086 --> 08:43.087
Why you looking
at me like that?

08:43.155 --> 08:45.389
'cause bob vila
kicked my butt again?

08:45.457 --> 08:49.860
Well, since the ice is broken...
That must have been pretty
embarrassing, huh, dad?

08:51.497 --> 08:53.897
Thank you, honey.

08:53.965 --> 08:56.467
He brought it up.

08:56.535 --> 09:00.238
Boys, go wash up.
<i>(randy)</i> all right.

09:00.305 --> 09:03.241
So. I'm gonna cook dinner.
You want some chicken?

09:03.308 --> 09:06.910
Nah. How about a little piece
of vila, pounded real thin?

09:06.978 --> 09:09.013
Tim, will you get over it?

09:09.080 --> 09:10.781
This guy beats me
at everything I do.

09:10.849 --> 09:13.451
Last year the lawnmower race,
the auction. What's next?

09:13.519 --> 09:17.054
Look. The important thing
is the library got all
the money that we needed.

09:17.122 --> 09:19.624
I'd just like
to beat him at one thing.

09:19.691 --> 09:22.527
Ice skating,
skeet shooting.
Bobsledding.

09:22.594 --> 09:24.728
Oh, forget that. They probably
named it after him.

09:27.932 --> 09:30.100
Thank you, al.
Oh, no, thank you, bob.

09:30.169 --> 09:31.869
It was the thrill
of a lifetime.

09:31.936 --> 09:35.139
What'd you guys do?
Go to beards r us?

09:35.207 --> 09:38.842
No. Bob took me for a ride
in his new hot rod.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.444
It's unbelievable.

09:40.512 --> 09:44.348
He has a turbocharged two-liter
engine with 370 horsepower.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.552
And the whole body
is made out of aluminum.

09:47.619 --> 09:52.823
Big deal. My whole hot rod body
is made out of fiberglass.

09:52.891 --> 09:55.826
And we all know how fast
fiber makes you move.

09:59.064 --> 10:02.099
Tim, from what I hear,
your hot rod's not even running.

10:02.167 --> 10:03.967
Maybe you haven't
heard right, bob.

10:04.035 --> 10:07.438
I've gotta go.
I've gotta have my hot rod
in grosse point at ten.

10:07.506 --> 10:10.074
Bob, it's 9:45.
You're never gonna make that.

10:10.141 --> 10:13.911
Your hot rod couldn't.
Mine can.

10:13.978 --> 10:18.015
Are you suggesting your hot rod
can beat my hot rod?

10:18.083 --> 10:20.284
If the brake shoe fits...

10:20.352 --> 10:23.554
Wait a minute, wait. That's it.
Why don't we race our hot rods?

10:23.622 --> 10:27.391
Meet me at that old airport,
the military one on I-94,
tomorrow.

10:27.459 --> 10:29.927
You're on.

10:29.994 --> 10:32.563
Ok.

10:32.631 --> 10:36.267
We'll tape it for <i>tool time,</i>
so the audience can watch me
kick your tailpipes

10:36.335 --> 10:38.436
Right back to <i>that old house.</i>

10:38.503 --> 10:41.639
Tim, the show I do now
is called <i>home again.</i>

10:41.707 --> 10:45.676
Ok, bob. Kick your
tailpipes <i>home again.</i>
We'll see about that.

10:50.882 --> 10:54.385
All right. Now we just gotta
check the oil. How's it look?

10:54.453 --> 10:57.588
It's hard to see.
That's 'cause it's clean.

10:57.656 --> 11:02.293
That oil's so clean, you add
a little oregano and vinegar,
you got a salad dressing.

11:02.361 --> 11:05.429
Dad, after we get it started,
can we go for a ride?

11:05.497 --> 11:09.367
No, we got a few more
adjustments on the carbs
to make, then timing again.

11:09.434 --> 11:12.035
But we can start it.
Who wants to do it?
<i>(both)</i> I do.

11:12.103 --> 11:13.904
Too bad. My car.

11:18.343 --> 11:20.344
<i>(clicking)</i>

11:22.881 --> 11:25.949
Good work, dad.

11:26.017 --> 11:28.819
It's so quiet,
you can't even tell
it's running.

11:32.824 --> 11:34.492
It's the solenoid,
I think.

11:34.559 --> 11:36.260
Hey, guys.
How's it going?

11:36.328 --> 11:38.128
Dad's taking a ride
in the hot rod.

11:38.196 --> 11:41.299
Hey, dad, slow down!
Let mom get in!

11:44.770 --> 11:46.470
I'm telling you,
please pipe down.

11:46.538 --> 11:48.606
Uh-oh, there's someone
on your tail.

11:48.674 --> 11:51.875
Is it bob vila? No, it's
a little kid on a tricycle.

11:54.212 --> 11:57.348
Would you shut up?
Come on, tim.

11:57.416 --> 12:00.751
He's knocking my car, all right?
Hey, boys,
go on up to bed.

12:00.819 --> 12:04.154
All right. If you get
it started, wake me up.
Me too.

12:04.222 --> 12:05.889
It's ten o'clock.

12:05.957 --> 12:09.627
He's not gonna go driving around
in the middle of the night.

12:09.695 --> 12:12.930
He's not, is he?
If he can get it started,
he is.

12:15.133 --> 12:17.301
<i>(clicking)</i>

12:17.369 --> 12:20.003
Damn!

12:20.071 --> 12:22.773
Is it my imagination,
or are you a bit on edge
tonight?

12:22.841 --> 12:26.043
How would you feel
if your solenoid was stuck?

12:26.110 --> 12:30.448
First I'd cry, and then I'd want
to know what a solenoid is.

12:30.515 --> 12:32.883
It makes the car start.
Everybody knows that, jill.

12:32.951 --> 12:35.419
Oh, come on, tim.

12:35.487 --> 12:39.490
'cause you can't get the car
started is no reason to jump
all over me, or randy.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.760
I'm sorry, honey,
but I'm in a race tomorrow
and the car won't start.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.796
Why not call bob and ask him
if you can race him on Sunday?

12:45.864 --> 12:48.766
I told him the car was running.
Why did you do that?

12:48.834 --> 12:54.705
I don't know.
Why does sauerkraut go
through me like a laser beam?

12:54.773 --> 12:57.508
I need to get a new solenoid.

12:57.576 --> 13:01.211
I've got to find an auto parts
store that's open 24 hours.

13:01.279 --> 13:03.881
Well, what can
I do to help?

13:03.948 --> 13:05.115
Get a hammer...
Yeah?

13:05.183 --> 13:06.684
...And four big nails.
Yeah?

13:06.752 --> 13:09.286
Go to bob's hotel
and puncture all his tires.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.028
Got it, I got the...
All right, starter's on.

13:18.096 --> 13:20.564
Now, if you just hold it up.

13:20.632 --> 13:23.501
Will do.

13:23.568 --> 13:25.569
Tim, hand me that
nine-16ths socket.

13:25.637 --> 13:28.572
Really appreciate your coming
over so late to help.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.375
No problem, tim.
I was already up
feeding my bats.

13:34.178 --> 13:36.647
Here you go.
Thank you, neighbor tim.

13:36.715 --> 13:40.484
A few turns of this ratchet,
and we'll have this starter
problem fixed.

13:40.552 --> 13:43.220
Wilson, I don't know
how I got into this mess.

13:43.288 --> 13:46.690
It's taken me three years, three
years, to get this rod perfect.

13:46.758 --> 13:50.428
Since I challenged vila,
I gotta race it
and it's not even broken in yet.

13:50.495 --> 13:53.731
Well, sounds like you didn't
think before you challenged him.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.366
How would you like it
if you were in an auction

13:56.435 --> 14:00.771
And some other neighbor
behind a fence made 400
more dollars than you?

14:00.839 --> 14:03.006
Well, tim,
I'd be hi-de-hurt.

14:05.376 --> 14:07.177
That's how I felt.

14:07.245 --> 14:09.947
I started doubting myself
you know? I felt worthless.

14:10.014 --> 14:13.884
Well, tim, it's been
said that when a foot
compares itself to a yard

14:13.952 --> 14:15.786
It always comes up short.

14:21.192 --> 14:25.729
So you're saying that vila's
the yard, and I'm the foot,
and he's better than me, right?

14:25.797 --> 14:29.500
Well, only if you perceive
him as being better.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.569
Ok.

14:35.039 --> 14:38.442
A philosopher once said, "if you
place a small value on yourself,

14:38.510 --> 14:42.045
Rest assured the world
will not raise your price."

14:42.113 --> 14:45.082
But if I believe in myself
I could win this.

14:45.149 --> 14:48.853
No, no, no, tim.
If you believe in yourself
you've already won.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.322
The moment we've all
been waiting for.

14:52.390 --> 14:55.392
The moment when you
drag us out of bed
at 5:30 in the morning?

14:55.460 --> 14:58.629
No. I unveil the hot rod,
we take a little spin.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.263
All right.
Let's do it.

15:00.331 --> 15:03.701
I want to thank a few people
first, if I could, ok?

15:03.768 --> 15:06.169
All right. Bradley, I want
to thank you most of all,

15:06.237 --> 15:08.906
'cause you spent more
time on the hot rod
with me than anybody.

15:08.974 --> 15:11.876
So if something goes wrong
tomorrow, I'm blaming you.

15:14.012 --> 15:16.146
That sounds fair.

15:16.214 --> 15:20.117
Mark, thanks for all your help.
Thank you.

15:20.184 --> 15:21.451
And randy,
what can I say?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.787
You're definitely
one of my sons.

15:26.457 --> 15:28.626
Thanks, dad.

15:28.693 --> 15:30.961
Honey, I thank you the most
because you didn't get jealous,

15:31.029 --> 15:33.096
Even though I spent more time
with the hot rod than with you.

15:33.164 --> 15:36.634
Oh, I didn't mind that.
I just didn't like it
when you got us mixed up

15:36.701 --> 15:39.770
And tried to rotate my legs.

15:40.906 --> 15:43.340
You get better mileage now.

15:43.408 --> 15:47.110
All right, everybody
stand back. Hello!

15:47.178 --> 15:49.780
Honey, it looks
so beautiful.

15:49.848 --> 15:51.214
All right, hop in.
Let's go for a ride.

15:51.282 --> 15:53.918
Wait. We're in
our pajamas here.

15:53.985 --> 15:55.519
All right. Go get
some coats, come on.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.923
Move, move, we're not
gonna wait forever. Come on!

16:01.059 --> 16:03.561
What are you waiting for?
Something to explode?

16:05.697 --> 16:07.497
No.

16:07.566 --> 16:09.667
You don't want to
go for a ride, do you?

16:09.734 --> 16:12.202
I want to go for a ride.

16:12.270 --> 16:15.573
I just want to tell you
that your car looks great.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.007
And?

16:17.075 --> 16:20.711
And that I think you can
beat bob vila tomorrow.

16:20.779 --> 16:24.414
Really?
I sure hope so.

16:24.482 --> 16:26.550
A great philosopher said once,

16:28.519 --> 16:33.023
"if your feet are short,
and you don't raise your prices,

16:33.091 --> 16:36.526
You're destined
for yard sales."

16:45.470 --> 16:47.571
Anyway, my money's on you.

16:47.639 --> 16:51.809
I mean, you got a 350 v8 and 500
pounds of torque in this puppy.

16:51.876 --> 16:54.645
Uh?

16:54.713 --> 16:56.413
Randy, you're starting
to sound like me.

16:56.481 --> 16:59.116
<i>(deep voice)</i> oh, no,
don't want that.
Yeah, you do.

16:59.183 --> 17:01.885
Oh, I don't know about that.
Oh, ho, ho, yeah...

17:01.953 --> 17:05.021
I'm getting in the shotgun seat.
Mark, you get up here with me.

17:05.089 --> 17:08.458
Watch the paint
when you step there.
Randy, here's a jacket for you.

17:08.526 --> 17:10.928
Seatbelts,
everybody.
All right?

17:10.996 --> 17:12.061
Wow!

17:12.130 --> 17:14.330
Come on in.
Put your seatbelt on here.

17:14.397 --> 17:16.599
Locked in, everybody?
Almost.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.301
All right, taylor family.
Drumroll for me.

17:21.039 --> 17:22.839
Just start the car.
All right.

17:22.906 --> 17:24.907
<i>(engine starts)</i>

17:51.069 --> 17:54.972
Hi, everybody. We're on
location at the airport
to talk about aerodynamics.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.308
No, we're not.
We're here so tim can settle
a grudge with bob vila.

17:58.376 --> 18:00.443
In an aerodynamical
sort of way.

18:00.511 --> 18:04.347
Welcome to <i>tool time's</i> first
annual quarter-mile drags.

18:04.415 --> 18:08.251
Speaking of a drag, you all
know my assistant al borland.

18:08.319 --> 18:11.388
Our drivers today
are tim "the tool man" taylor,

18:11.455 --> 18:15.693
And he will be driving
a 1933 ford roadster.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.662
And driving one of the
premier coupes of our time,

18:18.730 --> 18:22.632
Is one of the premier tool men
of our time, bob vila.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.702
I'll wait for you
at the finish line.

18:24.769 --> 18:26.770
I'll be there with
your second-place trophy.

18:26.838 --> 18:29.606
I doubt that.
Good luck, guys.

18:29.674 --> 18:32.109
I don't need luck,
I just need my car to start.

18:32.177 --> 18:35.312
Heidi, my helmet, please.
Here you go, tim.

18:35.379 --> 18:37.214
Thank you.
You're welcome.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.119
<i>(engine starts)</i>

19:16.988 --> 19:19.823
Go, tim!
Gee, he's really
keeping up with him.

19:36.507 --> 19:39.843
Honey, you ok?
Sure.

19:39.911 --> 19:42.045
Don't just stand there,
grab a rag.

19:43.748 --> 19:46.349
You seem to be taking this
loss to bob vila pretty well.

19:46.417 --> 19:49.253
Maybe I don't
think it's a loss.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.955
I like it when you're deluded.
You're much easier to deal with.

19:54.325 --> 19:56.927
I'm just saying I think
I could have beat him.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.996
How do you mean that?

19:59.063 --> 20:03.566
We were neck and neck.
If I'd pushed it to the redline,
I could've gone right by him.

20:03.634 --> 20:06.436
Why didn't you?
Well, honey,
it's a new motor.

20:06.504 --> 20:09.372
I didn't break it in.
I didn't want to risk
blowing the thing up.

20:10.474 --> 20:12.475
Are you saying
you let him win?

20:12.543 --> 20:14.011
I'm saying bob
bought his hot rod.

20:14.078 --> 20:16.413
I put three years into this,
I built this thing.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.216
I'm not gonna risk wrecking it
over some stupid race.

20:21.419 --> 20:23.453
I'm real proud of you.

20:23.521 --> 20:24.688
Well, you know
what they say.

20:24.755 --> 20:27.724
"spare the rod,
to heck with bob."

20:34.699 --> 20:37.801
You are getting very
mature in your old age.

20:37.869 --> 20:41.371
Ah, you can't stay
young forever, honey.

20:41.439 --> 20:43.640
Hey. What do you say...

20:43.708 --> 20:47.277
We pop ourselves
into the rumble seat
and make out like we used to?

20:47.345 --> 20:49.679
Cool.

20:49.747 --> 20:51.915
Let's see here.

20:51.983 --> 20:54.384
All right.

20:54.452 --> 20:56.686
Wait a minute.
I gotta spit out my gum.

22:41.025 --> 22:44.127
You are getting very
mature in your old age.

22:44.195 --> 22:48.065
Ah, you can't stay
young forever, honey.
That's true.

22:48.132 --> 22:52.035
Hey, what do you say
we hop ourselves into the...
