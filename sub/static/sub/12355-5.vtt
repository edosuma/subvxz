00:07.041 --> 00:08.281
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:08.305 --> 00:09.237
I pulled the goalie.

00:09.238 --> 00:10.737
Wait, you stopped
using birth control?

00:10.796 --> 00:12.229
I did!

00:12.230 --> 00:14.029
Jeannie, Sarah wants
to have a baby.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.829
Hey!
That's my fucking car, man!

00:15.830 --> 00:18.029
Getting the old band back
together for a reunion tour?

00:18.030 --> 00:19.995
So you asked me
to bail you out of jail

00:19.996 --> 00:21.595
so you could hit me up for a job?
No, that's not...

00:21.596 --> 00:22.629
You're fucking amazing.

00:22.630 --> 00:25.029
<i>So, listen, since you're
playing catch-up,</i>

00:25.030 --> 00:26.662
I'm gonna take
the lead at DollaHyde.

00:26.663 --> 00:28.295
The meeting was at 10:00.
Who cares?

00:28.296 --> 00:31.362
They need us to put a shitload
of paper in they pocket.

00:31.363 --> 00:33.329
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- Attitude.

00:33.330 --> 00:34.995
- I like it.
<i>- Drug dealers.</i>

00:34.996 --> 00:36.495
So DollaHyde's seed money...

00:36.496 --> 00:38.829
Did not come from
a venture capital firm.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.162
And I'd gotten so used to consulting
for white-collar criminals.

00:41.163 --> 00:42.529
I want him out.

00:42.530 --> 00:44.029
Any way you can
convince him to sell?

00:44.030 --> 00:45.862
Lukas is all,
"DollaHyde my baby."

00:45.863 --> 00:47.729
Well, DollaHyde my baby, too.

00:47.730 --> 00:49.262
And he's gonna fuck us up.

00:49.263 --> 00:50.996
No, he's not.

Oh, hey, Dad, coffee's on.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.062
Oh. Hey.

01:20.063 --> 01:21.462
I just really need some water.

01:25.663 --> 01:26.629
Hello.

01:28.930 --> 01:29.962
Is that my shirt?
Huh?

01:29.963 --> 01:32.495
Oh!
Yeah, I think it is.

01:32.496 --> 01:33.762
Sorry, you can have it back.

01:33.763 --> 01:35.129
Lea-Leave it on,
leave it on.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.395
Leave it on.
Jesus Christ.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.495
Oh, hey, Chantelle.

01:38.496 --> 01:39.529
Oh! Hey.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.429
"Hey, Chantelle..."
Wait a minute.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.462
What in the...

01:42.463 --> 01:44.262
Grandpa's new friend.

01:44.263 --> 01:45.362
Oh.

01:45.363 --> 01:47.929
Grandpa's new friend.

01:47.930 --> 01:50.762
Do your parents know you've been
out on a school night, Chantelle?

01:50.763 --> 01:52.029
I did hear you were funny.

01:52.030 --> 01:52.962
Ah.

01:52.963 --> 01:55.329
And I've heard
nothing about you.

01:55.330 --> 01:56.995
Where's that water, kitten?

01:56.996 --> 01:58.262
I'm parched.

01:58.263 --> 02:00.062
Whoa.

02:00.063 --> 02:01.162
Whoa!

02:01.163 --> 02:02.795
Need it to wash
down that Viagra?

02:02.796 --> 02:04.195
Will you be cool?

02:04.196 --> 02:05.129
Are you kidding me?

02:05.130 --> 02:06.262
This is appropriate to you?

02:06.263 --> 02:07.462
What the fuck is going on?

02:07.463 --> 02:09.128
What's it look like's going on?

02:09.130 --> 02:10.729
Look, this is ridiculous.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.529
I think she's a little young

02:12.530 --> 02:13.662
even for me, Pop.

02:13.663 --> 02:14.963
Oh, well, good.

02:16.496 --> 02:17.462
Name is Chantelle.

02:17.463 --> 02:18.529
Yes.
Yeah.

02:18.530 --> 02:19.462
I got that piece
of information.

02:19.463 --> 02:21.295
Where'd you meet her?
Spearmint Rhino?

02:21.296 --> 02:23.295
At a talk I gave.
Mm-hmm.

02:23.296 --> 02:25.095
She's a therapist.

02:25.096 --> 02:27.462
Yeah... she's
a therapist

02:27.463 --> 02:28.995
finishing up her doctorate.
Ooh.

02:28.996 --> 02:30.529
I want her to feel welcome.

02:30.530 --> 02:31.595
Well, I think you
already handled that.

02:31.596 --> 02:32.796
All right?

02:34.396 --> 02:35.496
Welcome, Chantelle.

02:36.896 --> 02:38.829
See you kids later.

02:38.830 --> 02:40.595
And, Chantelle...

02:40.596 --> 02:43.295
my house is not
clothing-optional, okay?

02:43.296 --> 02:44.496
Go put your Garanimals on.

02:47.196 --> 02:48.362
Oh, boy.

02:48.363 --> 02:49.795
This day just gets
better and better.

02:49.796 --> 02:51.562
Hey, Mom.

02:51.563 --> 02:54.762
You, uh, you trolling for pussy

02:54.763 --> 02:56.629
at, uh, Color Me Mine, Marty?

02:56.630 --> 02:57.995
She's a little young,

02:57.996 --> 02:59.195
even for you.

02:59.196 --> 03:00.295
She's not with me, okay?
She's with...

03:00.296 --> 03:01.229
I could not care less.

03:01.230 --> 03:02.229
Yeah, that makes two of us.

03:02.230 --> 03:04.095
She's with me.
Ugh.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.862
Sweetie, come on.

03:05.863 --> 03:08.095
Actually, I haven't had
breakfast yet, Mom.

03:08.096 --> 03:10.529
We'll get a frappuccino
on the way to school. Yay.

03:10.530 --> 03:12.229
- Love you, Grandpa.
- Bye, Chantelle. - Bye.

03:12.230 --> 03:13.829
Wow.

03:13.830 --> 03:15.062
Gross. Come on.

03:15.063 --> 03:16.462
- Ah...
<i>- No, you don't get it.</i>

03:16.463 --> 03:18.595
You've never worked for a
top-tier consulting firm before.

03:18.596 --> 03:19.662
That's true.
Right.

03:19.663 --> 03:21.095
So you would have no idea
about the pressures.

03:21.096 --> 03:23.629
If I could get back
to my old boss...

03:23.630 --> 03:24.529
Marty, right?

03:24.530 --> 03:25.762
You think he's the answer?

03:25.763 --> 03:27.795
Yes. Yeah.

03:27.796 --> 03:29.062
Yeah. I just need

03:29.063 --> 03:30.329
one big fucking move.

03:30.330 --> 03:32.395
Clyde, when you go through
a break like you did,

03:32.396 --> 03:34.876
you need to do some hard work
with what you feel is the reason.

03:38.396 --> 03:39.862
How's business here,
by the way?

03:39.863 --> 03:41.529
'Cause I could show you
and your partners

03:41.530 --> 03:43.162
how to blast open
those profit margins.

03:43.163 --> 03:44.729
It looks like you could
use it a tiny bit.

03:44.730 --> 03:46.195
Obviously, that's not an option.

03:46.196 --> 03:47.562
Oof!

03:47.563 --> 03:49.329
Almost went over.
That's 50 minutes.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.129
All right, Clyde.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.895
Now, if I could just see

03:52.896 --> 03:53.995
your court card.

03:53.996 --> 03:55.262
Yeah, of course.

03:55.263 --> 03:57.362
Yeah, and if you can just
throw me that little script

03:57.363 --> 03:58.629
for Wellbutrin you want me on.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.362
And then throw in some Xanax

04:00.363 --> 04:02.629
there as well, that'd be great.

04:02.630 --> 04:05.395
I am gonna up that Wellbutrin,

04:05.396 --> 04:06.662
and no Xanax.
No Xanax?

04:06.663 --> 04:07.762
You good with that?
That's fine.

04:07.763 --> 04:09.029
Okay.
Okay.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.462
Okay.
Mmm...

04:10.463 --> 04:11.662
I'm ready now.
Yeah, yeah.

04:11.663 --> 04:13.062
Put your baby juice in me.
What?

04:13.063 --> 04:15.129
I can feel a life

04:15.130 --> 04:17.262
starting with every thrust.

04:17.262 --> 04:18.595
Really?
Do it!

04:18.596 --> 04:20.962
Can you see our adorable child?
Uh... yeah...

04:20.963 --> 04:22.129
He's being made
right now, babe.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.295
And he has your eyes.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.662
And he's got a cute
little penis...

04:25.663 --> 04:26.996
Oh, God.
...just like his father.

04:30.863 --> 04:34.095
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

04:34.096 --> 04:36.395
Oh, yeah.

04:36.396 --> 04:38.463
That was...
felt so good. Mmm.

04:43.596 --> 04:46.729
Honey?
Mm-hmm?

04:46.730 --> 04:48.129
Did you come?
What?

04:48.130 --> 04:49.962
Because it totally d...
it didn't seem like you did.

04:49.963 --> 04:51.462
What are you talking about?

04:51.463 --> 04:53.262
No, I-I made
the noise and everything.

04:53.263 --> 04:54.829
Of course I came.

04:54.830 --> 04:56.629
I didn't come.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.662
Oh...

04:57.663 --> 04:59.229
I've been withholding orgasm

04:59.230 --> 05:01.329
since she decided...
we decided to, uh, get pregnant.

05:01.330 --> 05:02.462
Why don't you just tell her

05:02.463 --> 05:03.829
that you don't
want a baby, Doug?

05:03.830 --> 05:05.295
I mean, instead of telling me.

05:05.296 --> 05:06.629
Because I want to want a baby.

05:06.630 --> 05:07.895
I just...
it's odd,

05:07.896 --> 05:09.329
and it's all happening so fast.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.129
Hey, I mean, I hear you.

05:11.130 --> 05:12.895
Who wants to be a milk machine

05:12.896 --> 05:14.695
for a bunch of
teeny-tiny assholes?

05:14.696 --> 05:15.795
Not me, but...

05:15.796 --> 05:17.362
Just tell her.

05:17.363 --> 05:19.495
I don't know. There's still
so much I haven't done.

05:19.496 --> 05:20.929
Like spelunking.

05:20.930 --> 05:22.462
Or-or participating

05:22.463 --> 05:24.129
in an authentic
sweat lodge ritual.

05:24.130 --> 05:25.595
Or hanging out with Marty more.

05:25.596 --> 05:27.429
Marty's never gonna
hang out with you, Doug.

05:27.430 --> 05:28.229
That's mean.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.762
Ah, shit. Oh, God.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.062
J-Jeannie, Jeannie,
Jeannie, wait.

05:31.063 --> 05:32.695
See, the problem is,
I got interrupted,

05:32.696 --> 05:34.729
so it really hurts, you know?

05:34.730 --> 05:36.595
Sarah's got these moves
that really get me there,

05:36.596 --> 05:38.462
so I'm right on the verge of...
Yuck.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.795
Yuck. Listen.

05:39.796 --> 05:42.129
Why don't you just jerk off
at home in the shower?

05:42.130 --> 05:43.929
Uh, yeah, like a savage.

05:43.930 --> 05:44.862
Are you kidding me?

05:44.863 --> 05:46.295
That requires preparation.

05:46.296 --> 05:48.095
Uh, lighting.
Props.

05:48.096 --> 05:49.395
A little Maroon 5.

05:49.396 --> 05:50.895
Oh, God, I wish Clyde was here.

05:50.896 --> 05:51.895
To jerk you off?

05:51.896 --> 05:53.262
What? Of course not.

05:53.263 --> 05:54.729
No, because he would understand.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.029
You know, it's a guy thing.

05:56.030 --> 05:57.129
It's not funny, Jeannie.

05:57.130 --> 05:58.395
This hurts.
Well, great.

05:58.396 --> 06:00.062
Well, why don't you just
do it here before we go?

06:00.063 --> 06:02.896
Uh... yeah, okay.

06:03.896 --> 06:04.962
Are you gonna stay, or...?

06:04.963 --> 06:06.095
You can if you want.

06:06.096 --> 06:07.995
Not in my office, Doug.
Right! No.

06:07.996 --> 06:09.462
Of course not.
You meant in the building.

06:09.463 --> 06:11.029
Okay.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.029
Do not take
a mental picture of me.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.329
I wasn't.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.629
Hey.

06:15.630 --> 06:16.562
All right, kids.
Oh, God.

06:16.563 --> 06:17.562
It's time to make moves

06:17.563 --> 06:19.595
so we can go do our
little sell job on Lukas

06:19.596 --> 06:21.096
and get him up
out of that com...

06:22.130 --> 06:23.495
Everything okay down there?

06:23.496 --> 06:24.795
Oh, yeah, fine.

06:24.796 --> 06:26.062
He's withholding orgasm.

06:26.063 --> 06:27.830
Right.
Oh.

06:30.196 --> 06:32.295
My man Marty.

06:32.296 --> 06:34.029
You got serious game.

06:34.030 --> 06:35.430
I got game?

06:36.630 --> 06:38.462
Is this what we pay you for?

06:38.463 --> 06:39.462
To watch my black ass?

06:39.463 --> 06:40.929
I've had worse engagements.

06:40.930 --> 06:41.962
I know players.

06:41.963 --> 06:43.962
And you are a player,

06:43.963 --> 06:46.229
Miss Jeannie Van Der...

06:46.230 --> 06:47.495
whatever the fuck your name is.

06:47.496 --> 06:49.129
I know how you people do.

06:49.130 --> 06:52.595
You throw around
a lot of jargon,

06:52.596 --> 06:54.862
try to confuse me,

06:54.863 --> 06:56.962
make me think I can't live
without your wisdom.

06:56.963 --> 06:58.862
You don't trust us?

06:58.863 --> 07:00.829
Aw...

07:00.830 --> 07:02.662
Well, that's all right.
I don't trust you, either.

07:02.663 --> 07:05.163
But you do like me.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.695
Hey, Spanky,
quit eye-fucking me!

07:11.696 --> 07:13.129
What? I-I wasn't.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.129
I was looking at the hole.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.329
For the hole.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.595
she grabs a letter opener,

07:16.596 --> 07:18.095
stabs her in fucking leg.

07:18.096 --> 07:19.095
But the good thing is

07:19.096 --> 07:21.129
that if I stab her ass now,

07:21.130 --> 07:22.895
there's been a precedent set,
you know what I mean?

07:22.896 --> 07:24.129
Like it's a viable option.

07:24.130 --> 07:25.896
Get the fuck out of here.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.429
Yeah, well, women, I...

07:28.430 --> 07:29.562
can't get in love with them,

07:29.563 --> 07:30.863
can't cli-climax
in them.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.762
All right, Dre,
come on, man, you're up.

07:33.763 --> 07:35.195
I'll be down there in a second.

07:35.196 --> 07:37.229
Yeah, good luck, Doug.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.062
Hey, Marty.
Um...

07:39.063 --> 07:42.062
I thought the goal of today
was to be working Lukas,

07:42.063 --> 07:44.795
not making goo-goo eyes
at your new BFF.

07:44.796 --> 07:45.995
Goo-goo eyes?

07:45.996 --> 07:47.662
I mean, you're
cute together, but...

07:47.663 --> 07:50.362
Did you forget that
Dre was a client?

07:50.363 --> 07:51.762
Oh. Dre's a client.

07:51.763 --> 07:52.829
That's right.
Right.

07:52.830 --> 07:55.262
How many clients do you
clear your entire schedule

07:55.263 --> 07:56.462
to go golfing with?

07:56.463 --> 07:59.629
Or tell intimate details
of your life to?

07:59.630 --> 08:01.262
You hate everybody, Marty.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.929
Except your new bro.

08:02.930 --> 08:04.495
Oh, wait a minute.

08:04.496 --> 08:06.162
Are you saying
because he's a black guy

08:06.163 --> 08:07.862
I'm-I'm friends
with him now?

08:07.863 --> 08:08.829
Racist!

08:08.830 --> 08:10.329
What I'm saying is that

08:10.330 --> 08:12.695
because Dre is
becoming your friend,

08:12.696 --> 08:14.262
he is literally different

08:14.263 --> 08:16.529
than every other person
on the planet.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.562
And how many friends
does Jeannie have?

08:18.563 --> 08:19.695
Let me see.

08:19.696 --> 08:23.395
Two, seven, 46...
carry the nine...

08:23.396 --> 08:24.495
zero.

08:24.496 --> 08:25.962
I don't need friends, Marty.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.029
I'm pretty.

08:27.030 --> 08:28.595
Here we go.

08:28.596 --> 08:30.595
Oh.
Ooh.

08:30.596 --> 08:32.261
Well, look like this
six-figure membership

08:32.263 --> 08:34.395
didn't come with any skills,
did it, Dre?

08:34.395 --> 08:35.429
Hey, I got skills, motherfucker.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.695
I got skills.

08:36.696 --> 08:38.595
I just can't find 'em right now.

08:38.596 --> 08:40.995
I would check your back pocket.

08:40.996 --> 08:41.962
You're up.

08:41.962 --> 08:43.328
No, no, no, no.

08:43.330 --> 08:45.396
Jeannie-bean? The-the ladies'
tees are up front.

08:47.030 --> 08:48.695
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.063
I like it.

09:08.863 --> 09:09.929
Welcome.

09:09.930 --> 09:11.629
for $400.

09:11.630 --> 09:12.795
IQ stands for...

09:12.796 --> 09:13.929
Marissa?

09:13.930 --> 09:14.962
Mm?

09:14.963 --> 09:16.562
You have a visitor.

09:16.563 --> 09:19.062
Uh... hi...

09:19.063 --> 09:19.962
Clyde.

09:19.963 --> 09:21.229
Clyde!

09:21.230 --> 09:23.029
Hi, Clyde.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.929
I will leave you to it.
Thank you.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.696
I like the house.

09:29.663 --> 09:31.696
So...

09:35.630 --> 09:37.529
You were surprised to see me?

09:37.530 --> 09:38.529
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:38.530 --> 09:39.929
It's been a long time, right?

09:39.930 --> 09:41.662
Hope we could relate
a little bit,

09:41.663 --> 09:43.062
because I have actually been in

09:43.063 --> 09:45.129
a little bit of a mess myself.

09:45.130 --> 09:46.295
Mm?

09:46.296 --> 09:48.662
I was in one of
those meetings, um...

09:48.663 --> 09:50.562
court-mandated meeting
because there was

09:50.563 --> 09:51.995
an arrest involved.
Oh.

09:51.996 --> 09:53.729
Yeah, there's nothing
violent, nothing like that.

09:53.730 --> 09:57.162
But when I was there, someone
told me that you were here.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.995
I'm telling you, the second...

09:58.996 --> 10:01.029
the second they said
your name to me,

10:01.030 --> 10:03.795
I just thought that I could
just turn your life around.

10:03.796 --> 10:07.230
And I think I can get
your business back for you.

10:09.263 --> 10:10.429
Oh, my God.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.329
I know. It would
be like heaven, right?

10:12.330 --> 10:13.762
No, Clyde.

10:13.763 --> 10:15.962
You're a bottom-feeder.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.995
No, you're not getting
my intention...

10:17.996 --> 10:19.662
I mean, I'm at
my lowest point here.

10:19.663 --> 10:20.962
I'm trying to survive.

10:20.963 --> 10:24.195
I mean, look at me.
I'm-I'm shaking.

10:24.196 --> 10:25.695
And here you are, some guy

10:25.696 --> 10:27.695
that I hooked up with
once at New Year's...

10:27.696 --> 10:29.395
It was Hanukkah.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.729
taking advantage
of my vulnerability

10:30.730 --> 10:32.195
to make a buck. Come on.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.629
Now, that's not fair, okay?

10:33.630 --> 10:35.662
I'm not trying to take advantage
of anything. At the very least,

10:35.663 --> 10:37.895
I'm making sure you're okay.

10:37.896 --> 10:39.995
I'm just fucking with you. God!

10:39.996 --> 10:41.829
You're just fucking with me?

10:41.830 --> 10:42.862
Okay.

10:42.863 --> 10:44.862
I am so fucking bored in here.

10:44.863 --> 10:47.329
You want to see where
they make us pee in a cup?

10:47.330 --> 10:48.729
Yes, of course.
Yeah, let's go.

10:48.730 --> 10:49.963
Yeah.

10:52.263 --> 10:54.362
Uh, tee box is full.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.195
All right, crackers, come on.

10:56.196 --> 10:57.962
Get your ass out the way.
We playing through.

10:57.963 --> 10:58.995
Not now, right now.

10:58.996 --> 11:01.495
Sorry, white people.

11:01.496 --> 11:03.695
Sorry for what?

11:03.696 --> 11:06.629
So, since you are literally
charging us by the second,

11:06.630 --> 11:08.995
why don't you let us
hear what you got.

11:08.996 --> 11:11.995
Uh, we ran an 80/20
statistical analysis

11:11.996 --> 11:13.662
on the Walmart expansion,

11:13.663 --> 11:17.529
and, um... it's
potentially lucrative.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.695
Now wait one goddamn minute.

11:19.696 --> 11:22.395
Would you run that back
to me one mo 'gin

11:22.396 --> 11:23.429
without all the fancy

11:23.430 --> 11:25.229
bullshit consultant rhetoric?

11:25.230 --> 11:26.362
You were right.

11:26.363 --> 11:27.362
Whoo! Goddamn it!

11:27.363 --> 11:28.929
Sound even better
than when I say it.

11:28.930 --> 11:31.029
Now why don't you tell me
how much you billed me

11:31.030 --> 11:32.462
to tell me that I was right?

11:32.463 --> 11:34.662
Uh, we had to do
a little more than that.

11:34.663 --> 11:37.095
You see, we had to run
a side-by-side analysis

11:37.096 --> 11:39.995
of the Walmart expansion given
your current brand recognition

11:39.996 --> 11:41.896
in key demos.
And survey says!

11:43.363 --> 11:44.762
You got to expand the brand

11:44.763 --> 11:47.562
if you want Joe Six-pack
to know he's got to have it.

11:47.563 --> 11:49.729
Now, we ran some ideas
for said expansion.

11:49.730 --> 11:51.895
And a very cool backpack
and carrying case line

11:51.896 --> 11:52.895
is the frontrunner.

11:52.896 --> 11:54.395
What? Luggage?

11:54.396 --> 11:55.129
Right.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.329
Fuck out of here.
I like it.

11:57.330 --> 11:59.329
I bet you do like it,

11:59.330 --> 12:02.162
you fucking Barney's-wearing
motherfucker you.

12:02.163 --> 12:04.362
Hey, I'm not gonna be
too many more motherfuckers.

12:04.363 --> 12:06.495
Lukas, their revenue
projections are off the charts.

12:06.496 --> 12:08.562
And it can be tailored
to the DollaHyde brand,

12:08.563 --> 12:10.329
so graffiti artist
tablet covers

12:10.330 --> 12:12.129
and titanium
laptop roller bags.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.395
I mean, dope!

12:13.396 --> 12:14.162
No, Doug.

12:14.163 --> 12:15.829
Listen, Lukas,

12:15.830 --> 12:17.129
DollaHyde may actually
be able to do

12:17.130 --> 12:18.595
something that no other
clothing line

12:18.596 --> 12:20.262
has been able to crack yet.

12:20.263 --> 12:22.362
Hey, man, this all
the fuck you got?

12:22.363 --> 12:24.929
Let me let each and every last one
of you in on a little secret.

12:24.930 --> 12:26.562
DollaHyde sells lifestyle.

12:26.563 --> 12:29.762
That said lifestyle has
jack shit to do with luggage.

12:29.763 --> 12:31.062
Get the fuck out my way.

12:31.063 --> 12:32.096
Yeah, of course.

12:33.330 --> 12:34.695
So there's the garden,
whatever.

12:34.696 --> 12:35.762
Okay, listen, here's the thing.

12:35.763 --> 12:37.295
You have a ticket out of here.

12:37.296 --> 12:39.629
You pioneered one of the top
Web sites in the world.

12:39.630 --> 12:41.429
Mediawolf is major currency,
and that's your fucking baby.

12:41.430 --> 12:43.995
Well, hate to break it to you,
but it's not mine anymore.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.229
Point for my siblings!

12:45.230 --> 12:46.395
I know. I know
your family...

12:46.396 --> 12:48.462
And now I live here
with dreamcatcher lady

12:48.463 --> 12:51.062
and the other one who sold
her kids' schoolbooks for crack.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.129
It's my family's fun little game
of defaming me

12:53.130 --> 12:55.129
for their own amusement;
they have conservatorship.

12:55.130 --> 12:57.595
It's like I can't have a drink
in my personal time...

12:57.596 --> 12:58.829
Right, right.
...like an adult

12:58.830 --> 13:00.195
Or a fucking eight ball.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.562
Yes, exactly!
Yes, I get it!

13:01.563 --> 13:03.562
They just expect you
to be a pretty face

13:03.563 --> 13:05.295
and have the occasional
three-way with Paris Hilton.

13:05.296 --> 13:06.629
But fuck that.
You made good.

13:06.630 --> 13:09.929
So good, that with your family's
expiring media empire

13:09.930 --> 13:12.962
hitting a wall, they put you
here so they can get their hands

13:12.963 --> 13:15.229
on your fucking beautiful
Internet cash cow.

13:15.230 --> 13:17.429
Mm. You rehearse that
on the way over?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.662
Listen, you're here because
they want Mediawolf.

13:18.663 --> 13:19.662
There's no other reason.

13:19.663 --> 13:20.862
Truth.

13:20.863 --> 13:22.862
I'm here because I can
help save it for you.

13:22.863 --> 13:25.430
And I can get you out of this
fucking place, which is insane.

13:26.830 --> 13:29.995
Mm. I forget,
do you like anal?

13:29.996 --> 13:30.995
You speak Korean?

13:30.996 --> 13:32.362
Okay...

13:32.363 --> 13:33.729
I just... I want
to know you.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.362
God, are you kidding me?
No.

13:35.363 --> 13:38.095
Marissa, I can get you
not only the Web site,

13:38.096 --> 13:39.962
I can get you the whole
fucking family nut.

13:39.963 --> 13:42.462
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you to do.

13:42.463 --> 13:44.362
You're pretty cute
in that suit.

13:44.363 --> 13:45.495
You don't stop.

13:45.496 --> 13:47.029
And if I remember correctly,

13:47.030 --> 13:48.429
your thing was going downtown.

13:48.430 --> 13:49.695
Mm.
That was your thing, right?

13:49.696 --> 13:51.395
This what you want to talk about?
Yeah.

13:51.396 --> 13:53.529
I find you insanely fuckable.

13:53.530 --> 13:55.195
And I fully intend to get

13:55.196 --> 13:58.062
in some Korean anal with you
the second I have a chance.

13:58.063 --> 13:59.429
Promise?

13:59.430 --> 14:00.762
Oh, God, here, pinky promise.

14:00.763 --> 14:02.029
Can't break a pinky promise.

14:02.030 --> 14:03.362
I never will.
Okay.

14:03.363 --> 14:05.829
Professionally, I'm extremely
disappointed in you,

14:05.830 --> 14:07.529
Jeannie Van Der
Whatever-the-fuck.

14:07.530 --> 14:10.162
I thought that you would
be into the idea.

14:10.163 --> 14:11.729
I misjudged.
What can I say?

14:11.730 --> 14:14.130
What could you have said?
You could have said sneakers.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.262
What's up with your man?
Sneakers?

14:17.263 --> 14:19.395
Yeah, sneakers. The little white
motherfuckers with the laces.

14:19.396 --> 14:20.862
You wear 'em on your feet.

14:20.863 --> 14:22.829
Don't you think that's the first
thing that we trotted out?

14:22.830 --> 14:24.162
Don't you think
that's the first thing

14:24.163 --> 14:26.062
that every broke-ass
hip-hop line tries?

14:26.063 --> 14:28.229
Those broke-ass hip-hop lines,
they're fucking shit.

14:28.230 --> 14:29.162
And you're what,

14:29.163 --> 14:30.295
a fucking sneaker genius?

14:30.296 --> 14:32.195
You just know that your sneakers
are gonna work, right?

14:32.196 --> 14:34.895
For once, Marty Kaan, you just
happen to be absolutely right.

14:34.896 --> 14:37.595
I am a fucking genius,
and my sneakers will absolutely

14:37.596 --> 14:38.695
fucking work.

14:38.696 --> 14:39.895
You cannot expose
DollaHyde's bottom line

14:39.896 --> 14:41.729
right before the IPO;
it's way too risky.

14:41.730 --> 14:43.262
He's right.

14:43.263 --> 14:45.562
Well, Marty, I mean, they did
break through with DollaHyde.

14:45.563 --> 14:47.062
Hey, I like this guy.
He's a visionary.

14:47.063 --> 14:48.662
No, no, that was at a time

14:48.663 --> 14:50.762
when everybody was
looking for a funky alternative

14:50.763 --> 14:52.629
to The Gap
or Abercrombie, okay?

14:52.630 --> 14:54.095
Absolutely.
Sneakers are blown out.

14:54.096 --> 14:56.529
Yeah, but what if we built
a firewall in between

14:56.530 --> 14:58.095
DollaHyde and
the sneaker entity?

14:58.096 --> 14:59.395
That would quarantine the risk.

14:59.396 --> 15:00.529
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:00.530 --> 15:02.362
You talking about splitting
the company?

15:02.363 --> 15:03.895
We'd have two companies
rolling in the dough

15:03.896 --> 15:05.795
instead of one
when it finally hits.

15:05.796 --> 15:07.795
Yeah, but if what when it hits,
it doesn't make enough noise?

15:07.796 --> 15:10.129
Do I look like a motherfucker
that has a problem making noise?

15:10.130 --> 15:11.862
Never. I'm the loudest
motherfucker you know.

15:11.863 --> 15:13.895
I'm turned all the way up...
knob broke, no remote.

15:13.896 --> 15:15.695
You understand that?
Decision's been made.

15:15.696 --> 15:16.629
We doing it.

15:16.630 --> 15:18.663
Hit your fucking ball,
Marty Kaan.

15:26.996 --> 15:28.463
Oh, yeah.

15:46.496 --> 15:48.695
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:51.263 --> 15:52.262
Whoo!

15:53.530 --> 15:56.429
And the deed... is done.

15:56.430 --> 15:58.095
Don't give me any more details.

15:58.096 --> 15:59.762
I don't want a visual on this.

15:59.763 --> 16:01.929
Hey, look, I don't know what you
guys looking so shook for, man.

16:01.930 --> 16:03.429
Sneakers are gonna make us
a lot of money.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.529
I just run the numbers,
you make the call.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.663
You goddamn right.
You can thank me later.

16:08.796 --> 16:10.062
Luggage.

16:10.063 --> 16:11.262
Fucking idiot.

16:11.263 --> 16:13.696
Oh, not an idiot, but...

16:15.063 --> 16:16.395
All right, folks.

16:16.396 --> 16:18.029
Don't forget your seatbelt!

16:18.030 --> 16:20.229
Shut the fuck up, Doug.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.729
Okay.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.363
DollaHyde, fool!

16:24.796 --> 16:27.995
Now that was some
next-level shit, my man.

16:27.996 --> 16:29.362
Oh, well, you gave me
the sneakers.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.395
We just had to make him
think it was his idea.

16:31.396 --> 16:32.395
Uh-huh.

16:32.396 --> 16:33.429
So now what?

16:33.430 --> 16:34.829
Well, now

16:34.830 --> 16:37.262
all the capital stays
with the clothing line,

16:37.263 --> 16:40.995
and Lukas gets 100%
of nothing but a shoe.

16:40.996 --> 16:42.729
And DollaHyde?

16:42.730 --> 16:44.895
DollaHyde is squeaky clean.

16:44.896 --> 16:48.229
All bright and shiny for
that groundbreaking IPO,

16:48.230 --> 16:49.429
and all yours.

16:49.430 --> 16:50.595
That's what I'm talking about.

16:50.596 --> 16:52.229
Yes, sir.
You do not

16:52.230 --> 16:54.495
disappoint, my friend.

16:54.496 --> 16:55.929
Marty Kaan!

16:55.930 --> 16:58.729
Whoo! Love it when you say that
with the black power fist.

16:58.730 --> 16:59.929
Oh, you know what?

16:59.930 --> 17:01.595
You should come over
to my place tomorrow.

17:01.596 --> 17:02.695
Uh, yeah, I would love that.

17:02.696 --> 17:03.729
I'm pretty sure
he's talking to me.

17:03.730 --> 17:05.395
I want you to meet my fam.

17:05.396 --> 17:06.462
You should bring Roscoe.

17:06.463 --> 17:07.363
Oh, all right, great.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.462
OMG, what are you gonna wear?

17:11.463 --> 17:14.795
You're welcome.

17:14.796 --> 17:16.561
It's a great day
for Kaan and Associates.

17:16.563 --> 17:17.795
Job well done.

17:17.796 --> 17:19.595
Yes...

17:19.596 --> 17:21.494
Ooh, shoot.

17:21.496 --> 17:23.795
Oh, Doug. Oh, God,
Marty, please!

17:23.796 --> 17:26.262
It's fine. A little
club soda will get that out.

17:26.262 --> 17:29.229
Ooh, boy, yeah, it was kind of
like Mt. Vesuvius in there.

17:29.230 --> 17:30.463
Real buildup.

17:48.542 --> 17:50.062
Doctor says the damage
isn't permanent,

17:50.063 --> 17:51.595
but it's still tender,
and that's what worries me.

17:51.596 --> 17:52.629
Oberholt!

17:52.630 --> 17:54.062
Clyde! Clyde, oh, my God.

17:54.063 --> 17:54.962
How are you?

17:54.963 --> 17:57.262
Did you get my flowers?
I thought it was

17:57.263 --> 17:59.129
a nice, masculine arrangement.
What did you think?

17:59.130 --> 18:00.462
I actually came to see Marty.

18:00.463 --> 18:02.029
I'm gonna drop
a little intel on him.

18:02.030 --> 18:03.195
Huh?

18:03.196 --> 18:04.495
He is probably getting

18:04.496 --> 18:06.595
a bikini wax
for his date with Dre.

18:06.596 --> 18:08.395
'Cause he so wants
to fuck that guy.

18:08.396 --> 18:10.295
Okay.
Ooh, hey, did you see the redhead?

18:10.296 --> 18:11.295
Which one is this?

18:11.296 --> 18:12.995
The one I told you about, Caitlin.
Yeah.

18:12.996 --> 18:14.395
Yeah. Or as I call her,
"Chiara."

18:14.396 --> 18:15.962
Why do you call her Chiara?

18:15.963 --> 18:18.195
That's her name in Italian.
It's kind of a thing we have.

18:18.196 --> 18:20.529
Every time I see her,
I'm like, "Ciao, Chiara."

18:20.530 --> 18:22.862
And she's just like,
"Hi, Doug."

18:22.863 --> 18:24.062
So she talks normally,

18:24.063 --> 18:25.462
and you talk like a big idiot.

18:25.463 --> 18:26.895
No, it's like a thing we have.

18:26.896 --> 18:29.029
You and Marty still aren't
in the best place, Clyde.

18:29.030 --> 18:30.262
Are you sure you want to...?

18:30.263 --> 18:31.262
Okay, Jeannie, you know what?

18:31.263 --> 18:32.695
You're way less cute
when you worry.

18:32.696 --> 18:35.029
So do me a favor,
chill the fuck out.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.962
It's all good.

18:36.963 --> 18:38.262
Okay, whatever you say.

18:38.263 --> 18:39.762
Bye.

18:39.763 --> 18:41.762
Hey, buddy.
Hmm?

18:41.763 --> 18:43.395
I mean, she might have a point.

18:43.396 --> 18:44.762
Shouldn't you be
taking it easy,

18:44.763 --> 18:46.129
after everything
that's happened?

18:46.130 --> 18:47.729
It doesn't even matter.
That's in the past, okay?

18:47.730 --> 18:48.895
I'm looking towards the future.

18:48.896 --> 18:50.729
And all I need is one minute
with Marty.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.895
No, what you need is to worry
about your health, all right?

18:52.896 --> 18:54.329
The little kid inside here.
Oh...

18:54.330 --> 18:56.862
The world can be a scary place
for mavericks like us.

18:56.863 --> 18:58.129
Mav...? Are you
fucking kidding me?

18:58.130 --> 18:59.295
What?

18:59.296 --> 19:00.595
Don't.

19:00.596 --> 19:02.862
Dude, you kill it at work,
at this fucking place.

19:02.863 --> 19:04.495
You're fucking brilliant.

19:04.496 --> 19:06.462
And now you have Sarah.

19:06.463 --> 19:10.429
Man, you have a fucking wife,
someone who loves you.

19:10.430 --> 19:12.562
You're probably gonna have
some beautiful nerd family,

19:12.563 --> 19:13.895
okay?

19:13.896 --> 19:15.129
I have nothing.

19:15.130 --> 19:16.962
You have everything,
and you don't even see it.

19:16.963 --> 19:18.162
Yeah.

19:18.163 --> 19:19.262
Right?

19:19.263 --> 19:20.262
Yeah.

19:20.263 --> 19:21.595
I need to get back here.

19:21.596 --> 19:22.562
All right.

19:22.563 --> 19:23.762
Marty's fucked up just like me.

19:23.763 --> 19:24.862
He gets me.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.196
I do?

19:29.796 --> 19:31.862
<i>You really think</i>

19:31.863 --> 19:35.395
you can bring in the entire
McClintock media empire?

19:35.396 --> 19:37.096
I know I can.

19:39.063 --> 19:40.229
Was that...?

19:40.230 --> 19:41.262
Did I miss something?

19:41.263 --> 19:43.262
Was that the whole thing?
This is a big whale,

19:43.263 --> 19:44.395
and I can bring it
to your doorstep.

19:44.396 --> 19:46.062
Oh, wow, I am so sorry

19:46.063 --> 19:48.229
you wasted your time
and bus fare.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.762
Take care of yourself.

19:49.763 --> 19:50.795
Try to stay out of trouble.

19:50.796 --> 19:51.829
Marty. Marty.
And buh-bye.

19:51.830 --> 19:53.029
Marty, we need this.
If he's...

19:53.030 --> 19:55.362
Jeannie, he is
not here to help us.

19:55.363 --> 19:57.329
You understand?
He's here to help himself.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.395
Again.
It's McClintock.

19:59.396 --> 20:01.262
Hand delivered by Judas.

20:01.263 --> 20:02.729
I'm in the shit, right?

20:02.730 --> 20:04.129
But I have been punished.

20:04.130 --> 20:05.129
Working for your ex-wife.

20:05.130 --> 20:06.529
By fucking going to jail.

20:06.530 --> 20:08.362
Listen, I will
never make the mistake

20:08.363 --> 20:09.829
that I made with you before.

20:09.830 --> 20:12.295
Come on, Marty.

20:12.296 --> 20:14.095
What, are you gonna
punish him forever?

20:14.096 --> 20:16.129
For one thing that he did?

20:16.130 --> 20:18.029
What? You guys can't
just start over?

20:18.030 --> 20:19.429
I will not fuck this up.

20:19.430 --> 20:22.462
This would be huge for
Kaan and Associates.

20:22.463 --> 20:23.695
We need the revenue.

20:23.696 --> 20:26.263
And we need the profile.

20:27.896 --> 20:30.295
Boss lady says it's a yes,
so I guess it's a yes.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.662
That's what I'm talking about.

20:31.663 --> 20:34.395
Thank you very much, and I will
prove myself to you, okay?

20:34.396 --> 20:35.429
Thank you, boss lady.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.029
Weirdly emasculated boss man.

20:37.030 --> 20:39.162
Man, get the fuck out of here
and get the money.

20:39.163 --> 20:41.363
Thank you, sir.
I got this, okay?

20:54.063 --> 20:55.229
It's so good, baby.

20:55.230 --> 20:57.595
All right.
Mm-hmm.

20:57.596 --> 20:59.329
Yeah, oh, yeah.

20:59.330 --> 21:00.495
Yeah, okay.

21:00.496 --> 21:01.929
<i>You have everything,</i>

21:01.930 --> 21:05.029
<i>and you don't even see it.</i>

21:15.130 --> 21:17.762
Oh, yeah, uh-huh!

21:17.763 --> 21:20.530
Whoa, oh!

21:25.763 --> 21:27.929
Oh, my God, I did it!

21:27.930 --> 21:29.695
I think I just put
a baby in you!

21:29.696 --> 21:32.696
Yeah, you did.
Yeah!

21:34.730 --> 21:36.595
Oh, sweet thing.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.295
Yeah.

21:38.296 --> 21:39.495
FYI...
Yeah?

21:39.496 --> 21:41.795
Only one of us came.

21:41.796 --> 21:42.995
Oh, yeah, no, right, of course!
Cool.

21:42.996 --> 21:44.029
No, oh, of course.

21:44.030 --> 21:46.030
Yeah.

21:49.196 --> 21:51.495
They think they can
just get rid of me?

21:51.496 --> 21:54.695
I was the linchpin
behind that shit show.

21:54.696 --> 21:56.195
Whoa, whoa.

21:56.196 --> 21:57.495
Monica.

21:57.496 --> 21:58.895
What the hell's going on?

21:58.896 --> 22:00.263
She got fired.
Oh.

22:02.563 --> 22:05.129
What happened?

22:05.130 --> 22:07.462
Supposedly, I create

22:07.463 --> 22:09.862
a hostile work environment.

22:09.863 --> 22:12.863
You? Oh, no, do they
have the right gal?

22:14.063 --> 22:17.629
But, uh...
that cretin that stabbed me?

22:17.630 --> 22:19.895
She's just... somehow she's, uh,

22:19.896 --> 22:21.995
she's related
to the treasury secretary.

22:21.996 --> 22:24.695
Fuck them.

22:24.696 --> 22:26.462
Right?
Listen.

22:26.463 --> 22:28.629
I can make some calls, okay?

22:28.630 --> 22:30.663
I got your back, Mo.

22:31.830 --> 22:34.195
Uh...

22:34.196 --> 22:35.795
I have pills for that.

22:35.796 --> 22:37.696
Thanks though.

22:46.096 --> 22:49.795
Well, I am off to meet Lex
at the skate park.

22:49.796 --> 22:51.662
Negatory.
You are coming with me,

22:51.663 --> 22:53.862
and we are going to Dre's house.

22:53.863 --> 22:55.429
Oh, awesome, yeah!

22:55.430 --> 22:56.629
Can-can I bring Lex though?

22:56.630 --> 22:58.895
Uh, no, no.

22:58.896 --> 23:01.395
We are not bringing our family
circus to a client's house.

23:01.396 --> 23:02.495
I'm sorry.

23:02.496 --> 23:03.762
Well, fuck-that-shit.com.

23:03.763 --> 23:06.429
Because if I'm going,
Lex is going.

23:06.430 --> 23:08.029
Whoa, did I miss the part
where you're moving out?

23:08.030 --> 23:09.662
Huh?

23:09.663 --> 23:11.862
'Cause as long as you live under
this roof, you don't lip off to me.

23:11.863 --> 23:13.529
So I should just
act like you then?

23:13.530 --> 23:16.162
Uh, you better act like
you're gonna get ready, okay?

23:16.163 --> 23:17.595
Before you and I have
a real problem.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.329
But, Dad, we do have a problem.

23:19.330 --> 23:20.995
You're calling
me and Lex a circus.

23:20.996 --> 23:23.762
I mean, Grampa would say
I could bring Lex.

23:23.763 --> 23:25.429
You know what?
Grampa's not here, okay?

23:25.430 --> 23:27.229
And I'm not gonna
turn on the news to see

23:27.230 --> 23:29.329
if there's an Amber Alert
out to find him.

23:29.330 --> 23:31.529
Now, go get ready,
and get your mind right.

23:31.530 --> 23:34.362
Whatever.

23:34.363 --> 23:36.530
The fuck?

23:40.863 --> 23:43.463
Sometimes, I...

23:50.896 --> 23:52.062
Wow.

23:52.063 --> 23:53.629
Wait, let me... let me...
let me say it again

23:53.630 --> 23:55.029
with the right
em-pha-sis.

23:55.030 --> 23:56.729
Wow!

23:56.730 --> 23:58.762
I am a lucky motherfucker.

23:58.763 --> 24:00.762
Wait, hold on, scratch that.

24:00.763 --> 24:02.662
An extremely handsome
and lucky motherfucker. Ah, yes.

24:02.663 --> 24:05.195
You know what I'm talking about?
Let's get the order correct.

24:05.196 --> 24:06.962
But you know
on the real to real,

24:06.963 --> 24:09.595
sometimes I get this
nagging feeling.

24:09.596 --> 24:11.795
You know, that just
one little tremor

24:11.796 --> 24:13.795
or shift of the earth...

24:13.796 --> 24:16.195
all of this...

24:16.196 --> 24:19.362
can just fucking go poof.

24:19.363 --> 24:20.962
Mm.
You know?

24:20.963 --> 24:22.529
You feel it, too.

24:22.530 --> 24:24.062
I can tell.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.962
Oh, and by the way,

24:25.963 --> 24:29.562
you are now a new
member of the club.

24:29.563 --> 24:31.163
Stop playing games.

24:32.296 --> 24:33.395
No wait list.

24:33.396 --> 24:34.495
I hooked it up.

24:34.496 --> 24:35.695
My man, my man.

24:35.696 --> 24:36.929
Let's get something to eat.

24:36.930 --> 24:40.029
Like, just standing outside
a grocery store

24:40.030 --> 24:41.262
with a clipboard,

24:41.263 --> 24:44.229
making people resent you
and hate your cause...

24:44.230 --> 24:47.295
Hate the cause.
...is not gonna change the world.

24:47.296 --> 24:49.162
Nope. Sorry.

24:49.163 --> 24:50.662
So, let me get this straight...
you are for

24:50.663 --> 24:52.929
the wholesale destruction
of the rain forest.

24:52.930 --> 24:54.195
Exactly. I love it.

24:54.196 --> 24:55.762
Hey, what the hell
y'all talking about?

24:55.763 --> 24:58.429
Ah, who am I kidding?

24:58.430 --> 25:00.195
I always sign.

25:00.196 --> 25:02.429
Oh, your wife's a big softie.

25:02.430 --> 25:04.295
So, it must be awesome
having a dad

25:04.296 --> 25:06.495
that really spends
time with you.

25:06.496 --> 25:08.695
And Dre Collins?
Oh, God.

25:08.696 --> 25:09.830
How lucky, right?

25:11.596 --> 25:13.562
Oh, I'll get it.
All right.

25:13.563 --> 25:15.162
Why does he always
get to answer?

25:15.163 --> 25:16.662
I want to answer!

25:16.663 --> 25:18.495
All right, baby,
I'll let you do it next time.

25:18.496 --> 25:19.762
- Okay?
- Can I just tell you

25:19.763 --> 25:21.929
this is probably
the best meal I've had ever.

25:21.930 --> 25:23.595
Thank you.

25:23.596 --> 25:24.962
Baby, you are the best cook.
Oh, God.

25:24.963 --> 25:26.095
I don't even want to know

25:26.096 --> 25:27.895
what karma your mother
is gonna send my way

25:27.896 --> 25:29.296
when she hears you say that.

25:32.496 --> 25:34.595
It's Uncle Lukas.
He wants to take me

25:34.596 --> 25:35.729
to a Clippers game tomorrow.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.629
They're floor seats.
Can I please go?

25:37.630 --> 25:39.762
You got your science project
to prepare, sweetie.

25:39.763 --> 25:42.895
Next time. Take Roscoe upstairs
and show him your guinea pigs.

25:42.896 --> 25:44.429
Okay.
Go ahead.

25:44.430 --> 25:46.162
Well, thank you.
I mean, I love your house

25:46.163 --> 25:48.663
and how nice you guys
have been to me.

25:50.663 --> 25:52.030
You're welcome.

25:57.396 --> 25:58.462
So, how's that?

25:58.463 --> 26:00.195
Yeah, how do you think it is?

26:00.196 --> 26:03.230
My-my suggestion is you hold them
underwater before they hit their teens.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.095
I mean, it's not exactly what
I thought I would be fielding,

26:08.096 --> 26:09.895
but I love him.

26:09.896 --> 26:11.029
He's-he's a great kid.

26:11.030 --> 26:12.329
You know, I just want to...

26:12.330 --> 26:13.762
Just want to keep him safe.

26:13.763 --> 26:15.295
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.

26:15.296 --> 26:16.362
You know, from everything.

26:16.363 --> 26:18.662
Mm, beautiful.

26:18.663 --> 26:20.595
Thanks, baby.
Got you.

26:20.596 --> 26:21.562
More wine?

26:21.563 --> 26:24.562
Yeah.

26:24.563 --> 26:27.495
Now, don't laugh, but, uh...

26:27.496 --> 26:28.895
this is from my vineyard.

26:28.896 --> 26:30.696
Oh, will you stop
bragging already?

26:32.563 --> 26:33.662
Yes, Marty.

26:33.663 --> 26:34.929
I also have a vineyard.

26:34.930 --> 26:36.730
Uh, yes, Dre,
I heard you the first time.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.162
You know, maybe Lukas is right.

26:39.163 --> 26:40.729
Maybe I am a little
bougie at times.

26:40.730 --> 26:42.329
Yeah, a little bit.
Just a little something something.

26:42.330 --> 26:44.850
A little something something.
Not too crazy, but just sometimes.

26:46.296 --> 26:49.929
Yeah, so, uh, about Lukas.

26:49.930 --> 26:51.995
I mean, he's family, right?

26:51.996 --> 26:54.662
Depends on how you look at it.

26:54.663 --> 26:56.262
Okay.
What?

26:56.263 --> 26:58.395
Are we now having second
thoughts, Marty Kaan?

26:58.396 --> 26:59.862
No, no, no,
I'm not saying that.

26:59.863 --> 27:01.362
I just saying that...

27:01.363 --> 27:04.295
you know,
what we're about to do...

27:04.296 --> 27:06.829
This isn't just some guy
you work with.

27:06.830 --> 27:09.129
There's no coming
back from that.

27:09.130 --> 27:10.762
You guys have a history
together, right?

27:10.763 --> 27:12.729
A-A life basically together.

27:12.730 --> 27:15.762
My life...
it's in there.

27:15.763 --> 27:18.195
That woman is the reason
why I'm still alive.

27:18.196 --> 27:21.162
Now, look... I ain't
trying to disrespect you.

27:21.163 --> 27:22.262
You know what I'm saying?

27:22.263 --> 27:24.329
I ain't trying to be
disrespectful at all, but...

27:24.330 --> 27:26.795
I didn't come up like you.

27:26.796 --> 27:29.395
Every day was like
a war for me.

27:29.396 --> 27:32.529
And I fought that war for her,
and now for my kids.

27:32.530 --> 27:35.895
And they make me want to
keep fighting that war for them.

27:35.896 --> 27:38.595
Lukas is dangerous to all that.

27:38.596 --> 27:41.229
You don't have
a lot of options.

27:41.230 --> 27:44.562
With everything in
my fucking heart, all I know is

27:44.563 --> 27:47.929
I've got to protect this.

27:47.930 --> 27:50.662
You know how that feels?

27:50.663 --> 27:53.362
I do.

27:53.363 --> 27:55.863
Then let's do this.
