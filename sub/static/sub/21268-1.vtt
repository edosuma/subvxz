00:21.200 --> 00:23.266
Stage 13 of the Tour de France,

00:23.267 --> 00:25.232
quite possibly
the most difficult climb

00:25.233 --> 00:26.633
of the entire race.

00:26.634 --> 00:29.032
But one rider,
Italy's JuJu Peppi,

00:29.033 --> 00:31.633
is absolutely burning up
this mountain...

00:31.634 --> 00:33.266
nearing the top of the Pyrenees

00:33.267 --> 00:34.466
minutes ahead of the pack.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.466
He's practically
dancing on the pedals

00:36.467 --> 00:38.199
as he blasts past other riders,

00:38.200 --> 00:40.566
showing no signs of fatigue.

00:40.567 --> 00:43.999
The Tour de France,
the crème de la crème of cycling.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.299
At some point during
the three-week race,

00:46.300 --> 00:47.965
half the world will tune in.

00:47.966 --> 00:51.466
With 3.5 billion viewers,
it is far and away

00:51.467 --> 00:53.932
the most-watched
sporting event on Earth,

00:53.933 --> 00:56.733
but it is also perhaps
the most controversial.

00:56.734 --> 00:58.866
JuJu's opened an impressive lead

00:58.867 --> 01:00.499
with his
record-setting pace.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.532
JuJu now relieving himself,

01:02.533 --> 01:04.965
which is a thing
that cyclists actually do,

01:04.965 --> 01:06.733
and he's making quite a mess

01:06.734 --> 01:09.799
as he continues
to burn up the mountainside.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.266
Unbelievable!
JuJu Peppi's legs pumping away,

01:13.267 --> 01:15.866
pushing his body
to its absolute limits!

01:15.867 --> 01:17.299
How is he doing this?

01:17.300 --> 01:19.666
How is he doing this?

01:19.667 --> 01:21.466
And just then...

01:21.467 --> 01:24.699
JuJu Peppi's heart exploded.

01:27.133 --> 01:30.132
Here we go! He's into
the tuck for the downhill.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.699
No one even knew he was dead

01:31.700 --> 01:33.666
for about 12 kilometers.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.232
Look at that form!

01:35.233 --> 01:38.299
He's perfectly still
for optimum wind resistance!

01:38.300 --> 01:40.966
He died...
with his dick out.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.932
In the autopsy, they found out

01:45.933 --> 01:48.899
JuJu was on EPO and cocaine.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.666
Also, some insulin
and anabolic steroids,

01:51.667 --> 01:53.532
Oxabolone and Nandrolone.

01:53.533 --> 01:56.532
Trace amounts of
Norethandrolone and Furazabol.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.399
They even found some
heroin in his system.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.299
There was also Letrozole
and Cyclazadone,

02:02.300 --> 02:04.165
some estrogen
receptor modulators,

02:04.166 --> 02:06.032
Raloxifene and Tamoxifen...

02:06.033 --> 02:07.899
probably to ward off
breast growth.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.633
A lot of Oxycodone in his blood,

02:09.633 --> 02:10.999
Phentermine as well.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.232
Ortetamine, Bunolol,
and Labetalol.

02:14.233 --> 02:15.932
Plus he had apparently
huffed ethanol

02:15.933 --> 02:17.566
and taken a couple MDAs.

02:17.567 --> 02:21.065
He had clearly smoked some
crystal meth and/or crack,

02:21.066 --> 02:23.733
and there was a hormone
from monkey testicles

02:23.734 --> 02:25.766
that he had cooked down
into a broth that he drank.

02:25.767 --> 02:27.165
He also had apparently eaten

02:27.166 --> 02:29.633
at least one sandwich
from Arby's.

02:29.634 --> 02:32.165
JuJu Peppi gave himself a huge edge

02:32.166 --> 02:35.065
at the 1982 Tour de France with
performance-enhancing drugs.

02:35.066 --> 02:36.566
Oh my God!

02:36.567 --> 02:38.466
What the fuck? Jesus Christ!

02:38.467 --> 02:40.733
But he was far
from alone that year.

02:40.734 --> 02:43.399
In what has now become known
as the Tour de Pharmacy,

02:43.400 --> 02:47.532
athletes took drug abuse to a level
never seen before or thereafter,

02:47.533 --> 02:50.965
creating supermen
in Superman spandex,

02:50.966 --> 02:54.165
attempting to traverse
2,179 miles

02:54.166 --> 02:57.733
and over some of the most treacherous
mountain ranges on the planet.

02:57.734 --> 03:00.466
But how do you tell
the story of a bike race,

03:00.467 --> 03:03.032
the story
of 170 extreme personalities

03:03.033 --> 03:04.932
all vying for a common goal?

03:04.933 --> 03:07.499
You probably could,
but it would take forever.

03:07.500 --> 03:11.065
Luckily, we only have to tell
the story of five of them.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.065
Well, the
atmosphere is positively electric

03:24.066 --> 03:25.899
as the town of Basel
has gathered to greet

03:25.900 --> 03:28.099
the riders who have come
from all over the world.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.399
Here's one now, arriving all the
way from the United States,

03:31.400 --> 03:33.099
Slim Robinson.
Hey.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.532
Hi, Slim. Welcome.

03:34.533 --> 03:36.932
Slim Robinson was
sports royalty.

03:36.933 --> 03:39.499
His uncle was Jackie
Robinson, who, of course,

03:39.500 --> 03:42.232
was the first black man
in professional baseball.

03:42.233 --> 03:46.065
And throughout his life, Slim
excelled at many different sports,

03:46.066 --> 03:48.699
but obviously struggled
to stand out like his uncle,

03:48.700 --> 03:50.866
because he wasn't
the only black athlete...

03:50.867 --> 03:52.633
until he found cycling,

03:52.634 --> 03:54.566
which was very white.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.432
And it made him happy,
because it was the last sport

03:57.433 --> 03:59.065
where he could break
the color line.

03:59.066 --> 04:01.899
My uncle was the first
black something.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.499
I wanted to be the first
black something too.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.299
First one to ever
do it, baby. Woo!

04:06.300 --> 04:07.366
Slim Robinson!

04:07.367 --> 04:09.165
Seeing another black
man on a bicycle was

04:09.166 --> 04:10.965
a huge deal for me, you know?

04:10.966 --> 04:13.032
So, a lot of people
think of me as a boxer,

04:13.033 --> 04:15.432
but what they really didn't know
is that I love bicycles.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.132
When I was a kid,

04:17.132 --> 04:19.466
I got a Schwinn bicycle,
and, man, I would ride

04:19.466 --> 04:21.565
that bicycle all over
New York City.

04:21.567 --> 04:24.165
But then one day
my bicycle was stolen.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.399
When I finally found out
who stole my bicycle,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.699
I beat the shit
outta that kid, man.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.532
And I realized, "Hey,

04:33.533 --> 04:35.866
I'm a better fighter
than I am a cyclist."

04:35.867 --> 04:37.999
And this is how
I became a boxer.

04:39.066 --> 04:40.733
My whole life,
people have been referring

04:40.734 --> 04:42.899
to me as the nephew
of Jackie Robinson.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.766
But I think
after what I do here today,

04:44.767 --> 04:46.532
they're gonna start
calling him "Slim's uncle."

04:46.533 --> 04:48.332
Really? You think
that people will start

04:48.333 --> 04:50.566
to call Jackie Robinson
"Slim's uncle"?

04:50.567 --> 04:53.299
Absolutely. Yeah.
I disagree.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.332
But what no one knew
was that the color barrier

04:55.333 --> 04:58.432
would not be the only
barrier to fall that year.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.165
Because I am woman,

05:00.166 --> 05:02.999
everyone think I cannot
do what a man can do.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.699
"How can you ride without
the dick and the balls?

05:06.700 --> 05:09.099
How can you ride
a bike with a...

05:09.100 --> 05:11.099
how you say?
You say "pussy."

05:11.100 --> 05:15.432
So, this is why I had
to disguise myself as a man.

05:15.433 --> 05:18.766
Adrian Baton,
the great French mystery.

05:18.767 --> 05:21.366
Being your first Tour,
were you rattled by anything?

05:21.367 --> 05:23.366
The... the shaving of legs.

05:23.367 --> 05:24.766
I've never done this before,

05:24.767 --> 05:27.466
so this is a first, uh...

05:27.467 --> 05:30.232
I am a man, you are a man.
We don't shave our legs.

05:30.233 --> 05:32.733
Right, but as a cyclist,
it's essential, isn't it?

05:32.734 --> 05:34.699
But it is weird.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.599
It was my first time talking
in public as a man...

05:37.600 --> 05:39.965
Someone smells of lilac.
Is it her?

05:39.966 --> 05:42.699
Oh, yes, uh,

05:42.700 --> 05:44.932
very lilac and very hot.

05:44.933 --> 05:47.599
Ho, ho, ho, ho,
what a hot chick.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.165
And I think I nailed it.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.466
There were still other
firsts at the '82 Tour,

05:51.467 --> 05:53.566
including the appearance
of Marty Hass,

05:53.567 --> 05:56.165
the first-ever
African cyclist.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.599
Marty Hass. Marty Hass.
Africa! What's up, Africa?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.699
Feeling strong, ready for the race?
Woo!

06:00.700 --> 06:02.699
Oh, I was...
I was just, uh,

06:02.700 --> 06:04.999
psyched, psyched,
psyched to be there,

06:05.000 --> 06:06.965
you know, representing Nigeria

06:06.966 --> 06:09.032
and all my Nigerian
brothers and chicks.

06:09.033 --> 06:11.266
Marty's father owned
a diamond mine

06:11.267 --> 06:13.232
near Nigeria's capital...

06:13.233 --> 06:15.099
where he went to an
all-American private school.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.999
He rarely associated
with actual Nigerians.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.232
At a young age, Marty established
himself as the country's best cyclist,

06:23.233 --> 06:26.566
because everyone else was
on bicycles made out of wood.

06:26.567 --> 06:28.599
But on a serious note, Rex,

06:28.600 --> 06:31.633
it is truly an honor
to be here to represent Africa,

06:31.634 --> 06:34.299
because... I don't know
if you know this, but Africa's

06:34.300 --> 06:36.699
actually going through
some pretty weak stuff.

06:36.700 --> 06:41.166
Right. For example, oftentimes,
it'll get pretty warm there.

06:44.233 --> 06:47.532
Here in Nigeria,
we hate Marty Hass.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.833
Marty Hass would
walk into a bar,

06:49.834 --> 06:51.699
then he would go
over to the jukebox

06:51.700 --> 06:54.165
and put on Bob Marley, "Legend,"

06:54.166 --> 06:56.666
and be shouting,
"African music!"

06:56.667 --> 06:59.132
Jamaica is not in Africa.

06:59.133 --> 07:01.833
Well, you seem very, very
proud of your homeland.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.332
Indeed I am.
You know, I miss it.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.399
Being here in France,
I miss it back home,

07:05.400 --> 07:08.799
and... I bless the rains
down in Africa.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.599
Right, right, like the song.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.266
Oh, I'm not familiar with that.

07:12.267 --> 07:14.833
It's the lyrics
to the Toto song, "Africa."

07:14.834 --> 07:16.899
Uh, I'm not familiar with that.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.399
But at any rate,
it's gonna take a lot...

07:19.400 --> 07:20.899
To drag me away from you.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.032
From you. That's what I was gonna say!
Shall we do it in harmony?

07:23.033 --> 07:24.532
That's so bizarre.
I was gonna say,

07:24.533 --> 07:26.666
"Drag me away from you,
from this great interview."

07:26.667 --> 07:29.232
Real Africans didn't like
that song, "Africa."

07:29.233 --> 07:30.666
That's why he was lying.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.032
You ever seen the dudes
in the band Toto?

07:33.033 --> 07:35.532
Those dudes shouldn't
be singing about Africa.

07:35.533 --> 07:38.099
There's an "honor among
thieves" code in cycling,

07:38.100 --> 07:41.165
and openly discussing the use
of performance-enhancing drugs

07:41.166 --> 07:42.932
is certainly off-limits.

07:42.933 --> 07:44.866
But we found one former cyclist

07:44.867 --> 07:46.766
who was bold enough
to speak frankly

07:46.767 --> 07:48.899
under the guise of anonymity.

07:53.933 --> 07:56.065
I'm standing here with the
legendary Gustav Ditters.

07:56.066 --> 07:57.666
You look like you're
going to be carrying

07:57.667 --> 07:59.499
a few extra pounds
on the bike this year.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.932
Yes. This is what happens
when you train super hard,

08:01.933 --> 08:02.999
on the bicycle.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.633
Well, it is quite impressive.

08:04.634 --> 08:06.499
Looks almost like you
could play a real sport.

08:10.233 --> 08:11.932
Everyone was cheating.

08:11.933 --> 08:14.232
Everyone...
except for me.

08:14.233 --> 08:15.432
I'm gonna have to work

08:15.433 --> 08:16.799
extra hard to keep up
with you out there.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.032
That's right, you heard it.

08:18.033 --> 08:21.633
This year, I'll be on the bike,
riding alongside the riders,

08:21.634 --> 08:24.165
conducting my interviews
during the race,

08:24.166 --> 08:26.466
that is if I don't
pass out immediately.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.332
What do you think about that, Gustav?
Fucking hell, mate.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.699
The 1982 Tour de France was
the most eccentric bike race

08:48.700 --> 08:51.299
in the history of cycling,
in large part due to the fact

08:51.300 --> 08:53.899
that virtually every rider
in the race was doping,

08:53.900 --> 08:56.266
nearly all 170 of them.

08:56.267 --> 08:58.965
The reason every rider was
on drugs in the '82 race

08:58.966 --> 09:01.466
has to do with the
fact that credit cards

09:01.467 --> 09:03.799
were introduced to
Finland the year before.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.532
KultaBank issued the first
Finnish charge card,

09:06.533 --> 09:10.532
and they announced it with
a bizarre commercial.

09:43.767 --> 09:46.065
Yeah, it's
a confusing commercial

09:46.066 --> 09:48.132
for a dozen reasons at least.

09:48.133 --> 09:52.132
First of all, why is going down
on his wife payment for this guy?

09:52.133 --> 09:55.833
And what's he paying for?
Spilling the milk?

09:55.834 --> 10:00.065
We saw him spill the milk, so why is she
drinking milk in the very next scene?

10:00.066 --> 10:02.566
You'll notice the woman
doesn't climax,

10:02.567 --> 10:05.432
which means the debt
has not been fully repaid,

10:05.433 --> 10:08.333
and likely never will.
Right, guys?

10:10.233 --> 10:12.100
Sorry, I just noticed
the crew is mostly women.

10:14.267 --> 10:16.432
I'm not good at oral sex.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.799
The disciplinary cunnilingus
shown in the commercials

10:18.800 --> 10:22.499
certainly did not do its job explaining
credit cards to the people of Finland.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.499
And this included
the former president

10:24.500 --> 10:27.099
of the UCI, Ditmer Klerken.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.866
Well, the UCI was in charge

10:28.867 --> 10:31.099
of testing all the
riders for doping,

10:31.100 --> 10:35.266
and the guy in charge of that had
a serious credit card problem.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.932
I would see something,
like a cool car

10:37.933 --> 10:40.932
a cool horse, or
something like this,

10:40.933 --> 10:43.899
and... and I would hand them
this magic piece of plastic

10:43.900 --> 10:45.733
and they would give me
the cool thing.

10:45.734 --> 10:47.399
After three months, Ditmer owed

10:47.400 --> 10:50.332
nearly $16 million U.S.
to KultaBank.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.132
Because he was
in this huge debt,

10:52.133 --> 10:54.332
Ditmer sent every rider
a note saying

10:54.333 --> 10:56.866
if they paid him $50,000,

10:56.867 --> 10:58.833
they wouldn't
get drug-tested that year.

10:58.834 --> 11:01.499
"Hey, if you don't
want to be drug tested,

11:01.500 --> 11:03.299
"make a check out
to Ditmer Klerken

11:03.300 --> 11:05.032
"in the amount
of $50,000 U.S.

11:05.033 --> 11:07.065
"and you won't be.
Thanks you guys, Ditmer.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.766
"PS, if you tell
anyone about this,

11:09.767 --> 11:11.599
I'll fucking kill you!!"

11:11.600 --> 11:14.266
Silly.

11:14.267 --> 11:15.699
And here we go!

11:15.700 --> 11:19.299
The 1982 Tour de France
has officially begun!

11:19.300 --> 11:22.999
Guys came out flying on bikes! Man,
I wanted to be on a bike so bad.

11:43.634 --> 11:47.232
Day one, 207 kilometers
from Basel to Mohlin,

11:47.233 --> 11:50.099
up and over some of the most
breathtaking Hillscapes in the world.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.199
A serene landscape that
was completely juxtaposed

11:53.200 --> 11:56.065
to the ugliness
that was about to ensue.

11:56.066 --> 11:58.932
The riders still
holding tight in the Peloton.

11:58.933 --> 12:02.266
JuJu Peppi not surprisingly
at the front of the pack.

12:02.267 --> 12:04.965
And it looks like we've got
a beautiful fan up ahead!

12:04.966 --> 12:08.566
Hey, hey, Bella senora!

12:08.567 --> 12:11.332
And JuJu went in for the
grope and is losing balance!

12:11.333 --> 12:14.165
Can he stay up?
Oh no! Oh no!

12:14.166 --> 12:16.599
JuJu's lost his balance!
He's fallen over!

12:16.600 --> 12:18.799
It's a terrible crash!

12:18.800 --> 12:21.399
Yay!

12:21.400 --> 12:23.199
People are beginning to stand,

12:23.200 --> 12:26.099
which is a good sign.
Is-a not my fault!

12:26.100 --> 12:28.299
- I lose-a sight of the road!
- Hey, JuJu!

12:28.300 --> 12:29.833
Whoa!

12:40.734 --> 12:43.266
Jabin Dolchey was
known for two things;

12:43.267 --> 12:46.165
Fighting and his outfits
that he claimed to be made

12:46.166 --> 12:49.733
from a high-tech breathable
material he called Spanlon.

12:49.734 --> 12:52.499
Jabin Dolchey!
Speed the competition!

12:52.500 --> 12:53.999
He was an odd bird,

12:54.000 --> 12:55.733
and he seemed proud
of what everyone could see

12:55.734 --> 12:59.032
was a very tiny,
misshaped penis.

13:02.100 --> 13:06.299
Jabin's punch kicked off the
most massive scuffle in Tour history.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.299
Well, this is just awful.

13:08.300 --> 13:11.499
These men are literally trying
to tear one another apart.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.132
Cyclists are incredible athletes

13:13.133 --> 13:14.499
as far as endurance goes,

13:14.500 --> 13:16.932
but a great deal of 'em
fight like little bitches.

13:27.100 --> 13:30.099
They had a dance party,
and people said it was a fight.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.599
As a boxer,
it was offensive to me.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.999
And as is with every
accident near Switzerland,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.567
a Saint Bernard is
the first responder.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.566
It's really peaty.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.266
They tried to hurt each other,

13:42.267 --> 13:44.432
but I am a... a peaceful person.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.032
I don't do things like that.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.866
Please!
No! No! I beg you!

13:52.867 --> 13:54.633
No! No! Please! I'm naked!

13:54.634 --> 13:56.833
Please put me down!

13:56.834 --> 13:58.633
Everything I did that day,

13:58.634 --> 14:00.399
I did in self-defense.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.199
French authorities
finally arrived

14:02.200 --> 14:03.999
and put the kibosh
on the fracas.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.733
The first day was canceled,

14:05.734 --> 14:07.932
but with no major injuries,
the race was expected

14:07.933 --> 14:09.499
to resume the following day,

14:09.500 --> 14:12.266
were it not
for a forsaken water bottle.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.666
Ah!

14:32.667 --> 14:34.999
Ooh!

14:35.000 --> 14:36.133
Woo!

14:41.800 --> 14:44.065
If you take too strong
a dose of amphetamines,

14:44.066 --> 14:47.199
they can act
as a super powerful aphrodisiac.

14:48.900 --> 14:49.999
No, no, no.
Oui.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.634
No!

14:53.667 --> 14:55.634
No! No!

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
No.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.799
No.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.566
When I took a large
dose of amphetamines,

15:11.567 --> 15:14.466
I ended up having sex with a...

15:18.367 --> 15:20.566
Oh, we have to try every drug
on our banned list,

15:20.567 --> 15:21.833
so we know what
we're dealing with.

15:21.834 --> 15:23.999
I actually paint what
the experiences are like,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.233
so I can remember
the effects of each drug.

15:27.267 --> 15:28.699
Would you like to see them?

15:28.700 --> 15:32.666
So, this is what I painted
while I was on amphetamines.

15:32.667 --> 15:36.099
It's kind of what I felt like
when I did the drug.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.266
Yeah.

15:41.267 --> 15:44.499
This is when
I did crack cocaine,

15:44.500 --> 15:47.332
so you can see how similar
the two drugs are.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.666
Oh, this is from
when I did meth.

15:54.667 --> 15:58.799
So, you can see that meth is a very
different drug than the other two.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.199
Yeah.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.634
And all of these are for sale.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.833
In an attempt to
quell the media frenzy,

16:07.834 --> 16:09.299
the water bottle created,

16:09.300 --> 16:11.499
Ditmer Klerken held a press conference.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.399
Ditmer, Ditmer. There are reports
that you asked every rider

16:14.400 --> 16:17.232
for $50,000 if they did not want
to be drug tested.

16:17.233 --> 16:19.165
Is... is that true?
Yeah, that's true.

16:19.166 --> 16:22.532
I mean, no. Fuck! No. I mean...
no, I mean it's not... not true.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.266
Ah fuck! Ah.

16:24.267 --> 16:25.733
Now you guys are never
going to believe me

16:25.734 --> 16:27.532
because I said
it was true right away.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.599
But no, no, no, that's...
that's not true.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.699
But does anybody know
if you admit to something

16:32.700 --> 16:34.199
like taking bribes

16:34.200 --> 16:36.666
and you give all the money
back, for instance,

16:36.667 --> 16:39.499
does that mean that
you could keep your job?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.833
Ah! What a crazy
hypothetical question.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.366
Where do I even come up
with this stuff?

16:43.367 --> 16:46.099
And nobody ask me
if I'm cheating on my wife,

16:46.100 --> 16:47.899
because I am. Ah! I'm kidding.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.399
No, no. Shit!

16:49.400 --> 16:51.965
And one by one,
nearly every participant

16:51.966 --> 16:54.932
in the race was disqualified
for sending the bribe money.

16:54.933 --> 16:59.965
Of the 170 riders entered,
only five did not send checks.

16:59.966 --> 17:01.599
With only five riders left,

17:01.600 --> 17:03.599
it seemed the Tour
would be canceled.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.031
I didn't pay Ditmer.
What I to do?

17:06.032 --> 17:08.833
But if-a they end the race,
then I am punished for what?

17:08.834 --> 17:10.799
Why punish me?
Look at me.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.932
You put a little coke-a
in your nose, take a shit,

17:12.933 --> 17:14.733
have great sex,
wake up-a the next day,

17:14.733 --> 17:16.733
and you are
like a... champion.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.232
No, I would never do that.
Are you crazy?

17:19.233 --> 17:21.766
In an unprecedented decision,

17:21.767 --> 17:23.499
the UCI has decided to allow

17:23.500 --> 17:25.098
the Tour de France to continue

17:25.099 --> 17:27.299
with only the five
remaining cyclists,

17:27.300 --> 17:30.766
the final five, which I
am dubbing The Fab 5.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.633
You heard it here first,
ladies and gentlemen,

17:32.634 --> 17:36.532
these five riders will forever
be known as The Fab 5.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.466
Not to be confused with the Fab Five,

17:38.467 --> 17:40.799
the Michigan basketball team who
ultimately became much more famous.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.266
Who's that?

17:42.267 --> 17:43.666
That's Chris Webber.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.266
- What?
- From the wrong Fab Five.

17:45.267 --> 17:47.266
Well, fuck. Who... why did...
why did you bring him here?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.699
I don't know.
Somebody fucked up.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.232
What are we supposed
to do with this guy?

17:50.233 --> 17:52.965
Just wait till he goes to
the bathroom, then we all leave.

17:52.966 --> 17:55.165
Here we are, Stage 2,

17:55.166 --> 17:59.099
Tour de France!
It's a 250 kilometer ride

17:59.100 --> 18:02.232
through flat plains
from Basel to Nancy.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.165
Here we are,
Tour de France, day two,

18:06.166 --> 18:08.633
and I'm riding
right alongside the riders,

18:08.634 --> 18:11.699
getting the scoop straight from
the horse's mouth, so to speak.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.965
And to no one's surprise,
it's JuJu in the lead.

18:14.966 --> 18:17.866
I was really impressed,
what a great rider Rex was.

18:17.867 --> 18:20.132
I mean, he was right there
in the front of the pack

18:20.133 --> 18:22.065
most of the time
with that microphone.

18:22.066 --> 18:24.299
He was riding with the greatest
cyclists in the world.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.499
Well, it's only day two.
Don't kill yourself.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.965
Got another three weeks to go.

18:27.966 --> 18:30.099
I'm-a no kill myself.

18:30.100 --> 18:33.499
I'm-a never die,
not on a bicycle.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.299
That is a sure thing.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.366
And JuJu didn't die that day,

18:37.367 --> 18:39.532
but he did eventually,
as you know,

18:39.533 --> 18:41.699
because we showed it
to you at the beginning.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.899
But that day, he lived
and won the yellow jersey,

18:44.900 --> 18:48.633
then celebrated that night
with a well-earned massage.

18:48.634 --> 18:51.266
Each night, the depleted muscles

18:51.267 --> 18:54.266
must be softened in readiness
for the torture ahead.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.165
The riders' bulging,
shaved quadriceps

18:57.166 --> 18:59.065
and smooth, taut hamstrings

18:59.066 --> 19:01.499
require deep tissue massage

19:01.500 --> 19:03.466
with the finest oils available

19:03.467 --> 19:04.999
and strong fingers.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.065
All that built up lactic acid
can finally be ejaculated.

19:12.166 --> 19:15.032
After that, I passed
out, but not before,

19:15.033 --> 19:16.633
I remember, making
everybody promise

19:16.634 --> 19:18.366
to take turns riding up front

19:18.367 --> 19:19.799
so the rest of us could draft.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.099
You gotta take it down a notch out
there, JuJu. You're going too hard.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.899
Marty's right.
It's just the five of us.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.666
Yeah, we gotta work together,

19:26.667 --> 19:28.599
and all start drafting
for each other.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.699
One of the most important
elements of cycling is drafting,

19:31.700 --> 19:35.633
and that's when the cyclists take turns
breaking the wind at the front of the pack.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.866
It's much harder
on the rider in the front,

19:37.867 --> 19:40.833
but everyone behind him
expends way less energy.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.833
What the fuck, dude? We said
we were gonna take turns in the lead.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.499
Yeah, well, it's not my turn.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.899
Well, it's not my turn either.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.499
JuJu, you take the lead.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.399
I'm like, "Dudes,
what happened to the plan?"

19:52.400 --> 19:53.833
You know, nobody wanted
to do the work.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.165
Everybody's just slowing down.

19:55.166 --> 19:57.132
You know, there's
an old saying in Nigeria:

19:57.133 --> 20:01.133
Is there no honor
amongst blood diamond thieves?

20:03.066 --> 20:04.866
I think that applied
in this case.

20:04.867 --> 20:07.766
No one would ride in front, so...

20:07.767 --> 20:09.999
so we were all competing
to be in the back.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.999
Over the next seven days,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.132
the riders crawled
across France,

20:14.133 --> 20:16.165
each unwilling to take the lead.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.932
Suffice it to say,
during this section,

20:18.933 --> 20:21.267
the race was boring.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.699
Here we are, stage nine,

20:24.700 --> 20:26.566
the monotony continues.

20:26.567 --> 20:29.733
Now being passed by an old lady.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.599
Slim, you've done an amazing
job, riding slowest today.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.633
How are you holding up
at this pace?

21:09.634 --> 21:12.666
You know, Rex, riding like this has given
me a chance to really stop and look around.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.965
Yeah, I mean, look where we are.

21:14.966 --> 21:16.733
It's beautiful out here.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.166
Right. Sure.

21:20.333 --> 21:22.699
Yeah, so, what's next for you?

21:22.700 --> 21:24.432
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, Rex.

21:24.433 --> 21:25.633
Hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.132
Hey.

21:29.133 --> 21:31.000
That's where I met Fabienne.

21:34.533 --> 21:35.966
Oh.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.599
Yeah, excuse me for one moment.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.299
I gotta see about
something over here.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.599
Right.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.332
That's Slim Robinson,
taking a moment

21:45.333 --> 21:47.633
to really enjoy life.

21:47.634 --> 21:48.965
I totally understand
what Slim did.

21:48.966 --> 21:50.667
Sometimes you just
need a time-out.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.199
But the slow riding
suddenly came to an end

21:55.200 --> 21:58.199
when a rowdy fan
awoke a sleeping giant.

22:01.233 --> 22:02.833
What the fuck did you say to me?

22:02.834 --> 22:05.566
Today a man tell Gustav
I cannot ride fast,

22:05.567 --> 22:07.299
but I can ride very fast.

22:07.300 --> 22:08.733
- I will now field questions.
- Gustav!

22:08.734 --> 22:10.999
Gustav, my question is,
can you ride fast?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.833
Fuck you! Next question.

22:12.834 --> 22:14.599
Yeah, hi.
Can you ride fast?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.932
Fuck you! Tomorrow I will
ride incredibly fast

22:17.933 --> 22:19.566
and prove all of you wrong!

22:19.567 --> 22:22.099
The race starts now!

22:22.100 --> 22:25.566
And Gustav Ditters making
good on his promise.

22:25.567 --> 22:27.799
The race starts now.

22:27.800 --> 22:31.599
He is absolutely tearing up the
Pyrenees like a man possessed.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.232
Even taking into account
the past 10 days' rest,

22:34.233 --> 22:36.132
this performance
is off the charts!

22:36.133 --> 22:38.932
I do not know
what has got into this guy.

22:38.933 --> 22:41.899
No one knew what had gotten
into Gustav Ditters that day,

22:41.900 --> 22:44.633
but many suspected
something had, literally.

22:44.634 --> 22:47.199
Setting records is standard
protocol for the Tour de France,

22:47.200 --> 22:49.866
but when you blow records away
and burn up a mountain

22:49.867 --> 22:52.299
at a pace most sprinters
achieve on flat land,

22:52.300 --> 22:54.965
suspicions arise.

22:54.966 --> 22:56.766
Hey, come on.
How do you beat

22:56.767 --> 22:58.733
a man on drugs if
you're not on drugs?

22:58.734 --> 23:00.666
Wait. Did you just
admit to being on drugs?

23:03.200 --> 23:06.599
JuJu wasn't the only one
suspicious of Gustav's new-found energy.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.932
Monsieur Ditters, we are police!

23:11.767 --> 23:13.633
It is not blood.
It is not blood.

23:15.533 --> 23:17.532
It is Gatorade.
I will drink it now.

23:17.533 --> 23:19.766
Give me the Gatorade!

23:19.767 --> 23:22.099
Give me the blood!
Give me the blood!

23:24.700 --> 23:27.566
Blood doping. Most people
are familiar with the term,

23:27.567 --> 23:29.666
but how exactly does it work?

23:29.667 --> 23:32.399
To understand doping,
we must first understand

23:32.400 --> 23:34.099
the function
of the red blood cell.

23:42.433 --> 23:44.599
Hi, I'm a red blood cell,

23:44.600 --> 23:47.532
and it's the most common type
of blood cell in your body.

23:47.533 --> 23:49.099
That's right, my boy!

23:49.100 --> 23:53.165
Our job is perhaps the most
important in the bloodstream.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.999
We are the delivery men,

23:55.000 --> 23:58.499
delivering oxygen to all
the cells of the body.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.666
We work alongside
the other blood cells,

24:00.667 --> 24:02.199
like platelets...
Hey-oh!

24:02.200 --> 24:04.065
Who are the construction men...
Ow!

24:04.066 --> 24:07.799
And the white blood cells, who
are the police force around here.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.733
He's got a gun!
What?

24:11.867 --> 24:13.965
Oh my God!
He's fucking dead!

24:13.966 --> 24:16.532
All right, calm... calm down.
We were just doing our job.

24:16.533 --> 24:17.932
Pigs! Pigs!

24:17.933 --> 24:19.833
Let's burn
this motherfucker down!

24:19.834 --> 24:22.232
Kill these white motherfuckers!

24:22.233 --> 24:25.065
No! Don't burn my shop down!
I'm on your side!

24:25.066 --> 24:26.232
Yeah, burn it down!

24:26.233 --> 24:28.232
Stop! We're just
attacking ourselves!

24:28.233 --> 24:30.666
It's full-blown AIDS in here!

24:30.667 --> 24:33.299
The animator of the proceeding piece

24:33.300 --> 24:35.532
was a woman named
Victoria Young.

24:35.533 --> 24:38.299
I was originally an
animator for Sesame Street,

24:38.300 --> 24:39.866
but then I got
fired from Henson,

24:39.867 --> 24:42.366
because I couldn't
draw fast enough.

24:42.367 --> 24:44.566
Sesame Street was also unhappy

24:44.567 --> 24:47.499
with my creation of the
character Huey Black.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.032
Heya, Huey! Do you wanna
play a numbers game?

24:50.033 --> 24:51.499
Shut the fuck up!

24:51.500 --> 24:55.366
Anyway, Gustav Ditters
was blood doping,

24:55.367 --> 24:57.266
but not the way you'd expect.

24:57.267 --> 25:00.199
Cyclists dope to get
their VO2 max levels up,

25:00.200 --> 25:03.266
so Gustav figured, "Why
not add red blood cells

25:03.267 --> 25:05.965
"from the creature with
the highest VO2 max level

25:05.966 --> 25:08.032
on Earth?"
A cheetah.

25:08.033 --> 25:11.099
Just because I have cheetah blood
does not make me a cheetah!

25:13.033 --> 25:15.399
Cheetah. If I have
cheetah blood in me,

25:15.400 --> 25:17.199
I am not cheetah, yeah?

25:17.200 --> 25:18.599
I was never a cheetah.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.332
The UCI should have
understood that.

25:20.333 --> 25:23.699
If you put cheetah blood in you,
it wouldn't make you a cheetah.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.399
What are you having
trouble with?

25:26.400 --> 25:28.866
The way I say cheetah
or the way I say "cheat-ah"?

25:28.867 --> 25:30.532
Whether it was effective or not,

25:30.533 --> 25:33.399
Gustav did add a foreign
substance to his body.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.566
And for doing so, he was
disqualified as a cheetah.

25:37.966 --> 25:40.299
And the following day,
the field narrowed even further

25:40.300 --> 25:43.332
when JuJu Peppi took
his fatal tumble off a cliff.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.932
Holy shit!

25:44.933 --> 25:47.866
- Oh man!
- It ripped his dick off!

25:47.867 --> 25:51.266
People dope. Yeah.
They risk their lives,

25:51.267 --> 25:53.199
but, you know, this is a sport

25:53.200 --> 25:55.699
with literally hundreds
of dollars on the line,

25:55.700 --> 25:57.165
and dozens of fans.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.866
The... stakes are medium!

25:59.867 --> 26:02.065
By stage 14,
Marty and Adrian were

26:02.066 --> 26:03.633
the only riders left
in the race.

26:03.634 --> 26:07.099
Slim Robinson was still back
on the outskirts of Marsan.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.965
I love it here.
Stopping the race

26:08.966 --> 26:10.499
was the best decision
I ever made.

26:12.734 --> 26:14.866
Just been working
the farm with Fabienne.

26:14.867 --> 26:17.266
We produce dairy here...
milk, yogurt and cheese.

26:17.267 --> 26:20.633
You know, I love tending the
land, milking the cows,

26:20.634 --> 26:22.599
fucking the shit outta Fabienne.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.599
It just all really suited me.

26:26.267 --> 26:28.366
I still ride a bike every day,

26:28.367 --> 26:30.599
only now it's to
deliver our dairy.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.499
Only thing I'm racing now is
the expiration date on our milk.

26:36.267 --> 26:38.366
It should be noted,
though, that I am probably

26:38.367 --> 26:41.199
the first black
French dairy farmer.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.999
Number one, baby.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.232
Thus, unbeknownst to Marty,

26:45.233 --> 26:48.666
he found himself in cycling's
first battle of the sexes.

26:48.667 --> 26:51.999
It was just down to
the... to the two of us,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.699
real competitive,

26:53.700 --> 26:55.699
uh, and then something
weird happened.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.332
I started to notice, like,
little things about him,

26:58.333 --> 27:00.965
and started to feel, like, "I
want to get to know him better,"

27:00.966 --> 27:02.866
or something like that,
and that was strange,

27:02.867 --> 27:04.366
'cause I should've
been focused on winning.

27:04.367 --> 27:07.032
And I have to
say, Marty and Adrian,

27:07.033 --> 27:09.733
really seem to be enjoying each
other's company out there.

27:09.734 --> 27:15.199
I think maybe Marty knew I was
woman somewhere deep inside him.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.466
And here we go. Looks like
we're finally getting a race.

27:18.467 --> 27:20.766
No, they're pulling over
for a break.

27:20.767 --> 27:22.299
What the hell is this?

27:22.300 --> 27:25.165
If I didn't know
that he was a she

27:25.166 --> 27:26.766
before we went behind that wall,

27:26.767 --> 27:29.499
jeez, I sure did after.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.999
- Oh yeah. Oh God. OUI!
- Oh yeah.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.500
Oh man.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.132
Oui!

27:39.133 --> 27:41.332
Most hard-core
cyclists know

27:41.333 --> 27:43.065
that cycling was invented

27:43.066 --> 27:45.366
so that men could
fuck in the hills.

27:45.367 --> 27:47.132
I promised to keep her secret

27:47.133 --> 27:49.032
just between us,

27:49.033 --> 27:52.532
and in so doing, I became
something of a gay icon.

27:52.533 --> 27:57.366
Marty and Adrian became the first
publicly out gay athletes,

27:57.367 --> 28:00.733
while simultaneously being
in a heterosexual relationship.

28:00.734 --> 28:02.666
Their romantic tryst

28:02.667 --> 28:04.099
was well-documented.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.432
Most beautifully covered
by the French news channels.

28:07.433 --> 28:09.899
The way the French cover their
sporting events is gorgeous.

28:09.900 --> 28:11.199
I'll watch French
sports all the time

28:11.200 --> 28:12.866
just to kinda brainstorm new
ways of shooting things.

28:25.367 --> 28:27.032
Hey!

28:35.867 --> 28:37.766
The France 2 coverage
of the 1982 Tour de France,

28:37.767 --> 28:39.199
it wasn't just
impressive footage

28:39.200 --> 28:40.432
for a news team to capture.

28:40.433 --> 28:42.199
I call it groundbreaking
footage for film, period.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.833
This wasn't the French new wave.

28:43.834 --> 28:45.467
This was the French news wave.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.200
Don't put that in the movie.
That, um...

28:49.367 --> 28:51.133
It's too good of a line.
I want to get it right.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.367
This wasn't the French new wave.

28:55.433 --> 28:56.734
It was the French news wave.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.499
That was it.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.666
We tied a rope to our bikes

29:08.667 --> 29:11.833
so... there would be
no winners

29:11.834 --> 29:13.466
and there would be no losers.

29:13.467 --> 29:15.432
We would always be together.

29:15.433 --> 29:16.932
Well, to see Marty in the lead

29:16.933 --> 29:19.299
and in love made me so upset,

29:19.300 --> 29:21.432
because I hated Marty Hass.

29:21.433 --> 29:23.699
There. You talking
about Marty Hass?

29:23.700 --> 29:25.999
Yes.
Fuck Marty Hass!

29:26.000 --> 29:27.899
Fuck Marty Hass! Fuck him!
Fuck him!

29:27.900 --> 29:30.566
Stage 19.
Just two days remain

29:30.567 --> 29:33.332
and interest in the Tour
has dwindled nearly to nothing.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.332
No spectators line the streets.

29:35.333 --> 29:39.132
Passing cars have absolutely no clue that
an event of any kind is taking place.

29:39.133 --> 29:42.666
In fact, at this point, I have
no idea why we're even out here.

29:42.667 --> 29:46.266
I'm just a guy on a bike
following a homosexual couple

29:46.267 --> 29:47.766
who have tied
their bikes together.

29:47.767 --> 29:49.332
And to no one's surprise,

29:49.333 --> 29:52.699
Marty and Adrian shared
the yellow jersey that day.

30:08.200 --> 30:12.065
Here we are, the beginning of the
end of the 1982 Tour de France,

30:12.066 --> 30:15.432
the 187-kilometer ride
from Fontenay-sous-Bois

30:15.433 --> 30:18.232
to the finishing line
at the Champs-Elysées.

30:18.233 --> 30:21.267
Excuse me a moment. Just getting
word from the home office.

30:22.433 --> 30:23.566
Yeah?

30:23.567 --> 30:25.965
And just when
you think it's over,

30:25.966 --> 30:28.165
there's some shit
that's about to go down.

30:28.166 --> 30:32.366
That's bonkers! Well, some interesting
new developments in the race.

30:32.367 --> 30:34.699
The UCI has just informed me

30:34.700 --> 30:37.999
that technically, since I've
ridden every stage of the race

30:38.000 --> 30:41.666
and had to register as a cyclist
to bring my bike on the road,

30:41.667 --> 30:43.733
I'm eligible to win this thing.

30:43.734 --> 30:46.032
What? And I
think I just might.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.666
A perfect backflip from Rex!

30:54.667 --> 30:56.100
Whoa!

31:01.000 --> 31:03.032
And it's a matching
pair of tail whips

31:03.033 --> 31:05.332
from the lovebirds. Whoa-ho!

31:05.333 --> 31:08.733
And it appears Adrian is now
untying the rope for some reason.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.866
No! Adrian, what are you doing?

31:10.867 --> 31:13.733
It is the only way, Marty.

31:13.734 --> 31:17.766
We can do this together.
No, you do it for us, Marty.

31:17.767 --> 31:20.533
I love you. Je t'aime.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.132
No! Adrian!

31:24.133 --> 31:26.266
Je t'aime!

31:31.367 --> 31:34.466
I had no fear
when I ran into Rex,

31:34.467 --> 31:36.932
because my heart
was just so full,

31:36.933 --> 31:38.633
full of love for Marty.

31:38.634 --> 31:40.599
I could feel nothing else.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.965
In fact, I could feel
nothing at all,

31:43.966 --> 31:46.332
because I was also on...

31:46.333 --> 31:49.099
very much... Oxycodone.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.599
Whoa! The dude was a chick!

31:53.600 --> 31:57.833
Adrian Baton is, in fact, a woman.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.833
Well, that moment
really set the groundwork

31:59.834 --> 32:02.332
for a whole genre of
cross-dressing sports films...

32:02.333 --> 32:04.932
Just One of the Guys,
Nobody's Perfect,

32:04.933 --> 32:07.499
Ladybugs, Juwanna
Ma... Juwanna Mann

32:07.500 --> 32:09.733
is, I think,
one of the best films.

32:09.734 --> 32:12.299
It's arguably the best film.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.633
And that's not all.

32:13.634 --> 32:15.432
It appears Rex
Honeycut was riding

32:15.433 --> 32:16.999
with an engine in his bike.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.633
I guess that explains
how he kept up with the pros.

32:19.634 --> 32:22.965
It was all Marty, all
alone, heading into Paris.

32:22.966 --> 32:24.999
It was... it was heartbreaking
to try to go it alone,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.699
but I had to try
to win for Adrian...

32:27.700 --> 32:29.633
otherwise her sacrifice
would've been for nothing.

32:29.634 --> 32:32.699
An African was going to
win the Tour de France!

32:32.700 --> 32:34.133
And for a brief moment...

32:35.133 --> 32:37.833
I loved Marty Hass.

32:49.600 --> 32:53.466
And here's Marty Hass
approaching the finish line.

32:53.467 --> 32:56.799
He will be the champion of
the 1982...

32:56.800 --> 32:59.366
Wait! What's this?
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:59.367 --> 33:01.266
Slim Robinson is back!

33:01.267 --> 33:02.999
Even though life
on the farm was perfect,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.599
I couldn't get cycling
out of my head.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.899
Slim is
moving at an incredible pace

33:07.900 --> 33:10.432
on his cruiser!
He's caught up to Marty!

33:10.433 --> 33:13.432
But now it's Marty
giving a strong push!

33:13.433 --> 33:14.899
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:14.900 --> 33:16.932
we are in
for an incredible finish!

33:16.933 --> 33:19.866
They are absolutely neck
and neck right now!

33:19.867 --> 33:22.799
Getting closer!
Getting closer!

33:22.800 --> 33:24.999
This is one
for the record books!

33:25.000 --> 33:26.634
And the winner is...

33:28.100 --> 33:29.833
Slim Robinson by a long shot.

33:29.834 --> 33:32.165
It looked really close
from the other angle,

33:32.166 --> 33:34.499
but no, it was not close at all.

33:34.500 --> 33:37.099
Those defocused lenses
can be really deceiving.

33:39.867 --> 33:42.399
I still get emotional
when I think about it.

33:42.400 --> 33:46.833
I mean, I was the first black
man in the Tour de France,

33:46.834 --> 33:48.266
and I won it.

33:48.267 --> 33:50.833
This is the most important shit
that has ever happened ever!

33:50.834 --> 33:53.065
Fuck Jackie Robinson,

33:53.066 --> 33:56.633
and fuck Marty Hass
with his fake African ass!

33:56.634 --> 33:59.566
Guess what else?
I can make cheese, yo!

33:59.567 --> 34:01.366
I make some good cheeses.

34:01.367 --> 34:03.933
Was I happy that a black man
won the Tour de France?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.699
This is the first
I'm hearing about it.

34:06.700 --> 34:08.965
Somehow, Marty Hass

34:08.966 --> 34:11.331
found a way
to fuck us over again.

34:11.333 --> 34:13.498
You know, I think it's a
bit of a shame that...

34:13.500 --> 34:15.899
that an African
couldn't have won that race.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.599
It was a very fucked up year
for bicycle riding.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.199
Cyclists are hunks.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.366
I still really don't love
watching cycling.

34:22.367 --> 34:25.199
With the upper body of an alien

34:25.199 --> 34:27.431
and the downstairs of a horse.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.699
What really got me invested in the
'82 Tour were the characters.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.132
With only five guys, you really
got to know each of them.

34:33.132 --> 34:36.431
You really cared. It was just super
strong character development,

34:36.433 --> 34:38.331
and the whole thing,
like, really played out,

34:38.333 --> 34:39.965
like, a really
well-written script.

34:39.966 --> 34:42.132
I won the Tour de France,

34:42.132 --> 34:44.733
and I did it with nothing
but my own blood,

34:44.734 --> 34:47.266
sweat, and tears,
and extra blood!

34:47.266 --> 34:49.331
Oh shit.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.766
It was a tough day.

34:51.766 --> 34:53.733
Lost the race, lost my girl,

34:53.734 --> 34:56.232
and I haven't seen Adrian since.

34:56.233 --> 35:00.266
No, I never, uh...
I never did see Marty again.

35:00.267 --> 35:03.599
Um, my crashing into Rex

35:03.600 --> 35:06.199
was considered manslaughter,

35:06.200 --> 35:08.332
since he died, you know?

35:08.333 --> 35:13.232
And for this, I received...
35 years in prison,

35:13.233 --> 35:15.999
so...

35:16.000 --> 35:18.499
It was worth it...

35:18.500 --> 35:21.532
because I did
what I set out to do.

35:21.533 --> 35:26.734
I proved that a woman can cheat
at cycling as well as any man.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.099
That's something for
people to think about

35:57.100 --> 35:59.932
from this anonymous guy.

36:23.166 --> 36:25.466
My parents bought me
the bike out of van,

36:25.467 --> 36:27.099
but they didn't know
the bike was stolen.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.332
And then one day, I'm
just riding to school,

36:29.333 --> 36:31.566
and then I'm getting
the living shit

36:31.567 --> 36:33.232
beat out of me.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.599
And that's what
it's like in Africa.

36:34.600 --> 36:38.232
Like, sometimes they'll
run out of Nerds candy.

36:38.233 --> 36:40.965
Have you ever had that? I was
like, "Where's my Nerds?

36:40.966 --> 36:44.299
- Where's my Nerds?"
- A Nerds shortage in Africa?

36:44.300 --> 36:46.232
Right. Yeah, because
they gotta ship 'em in,

36:46.233 --> 36:47.433
and I'm like, "Dad!

36:49.200 --> 36:50.499
Where's my Nerds?"

36:50.500 --> 36:52.332
I'm not a milkman.
I'm a cyclist.

36:52.333 --> 36:54.332
You're not taking this bike!
You tell Slim's uncle

36:54.333 --> 36:55.766
Slim is back on the Tour!

36:55.767 --> 36:56.999
Who is that?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.733
Jackie fucking Robinson!

36:58.734 --> 37:00.232
Big news at the Tour de France,

37:00.233 --> 37:02.466
a fight has broken out,
and not surprisingly,

37:02.467 --> 37:05.466
Austrian muscle freak Gustav
Ditters is in the center of it.

37:05.467 --> 37:08.332
Here we have some footage of
him grabbing Jabin Dolchey.

37:08.333 --> 37:09.866
He used Jabin's flailing legs

37:09.867 --> 37:11.932
to kick other riders
in the face.

37:11.933 --> 37:15.566
Stupendous. I'm Mick Porterhouse
and... Woo!

37:15.567 --> 37:18.766
Oh no! My legs
are getting all shaky, man!

37:18.767 --> 37:20.999
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down, man.
He can't take that.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.199
Take it easy on him! I think
I'm gonna evacuate my bowels!

37:24.200 --> 37:27.266
Just go with it, Marty! Ride the wave!
That is not helping, Slim!

37:27.267 --> 37:28.866
Call my Dad!
Basta!

37:28.867 --> 37:30.866
Call my Dad, man!
Call his-a papa!

37:32.200 --> 37:33.733
After that...

37:33.734 --> 37:36.266
I rocked a trifecta,
and I passed out.

37:36.267 --> 37:38.566
Oh, cool, yeah.

37:38.567 --> 37:42.299
Oh, that's when you, um, puke and
shit and jizz at the same time.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.332
What's a basketball player
look like?

37:47.333 --> 37:48.933
We don't have that in Napa.

37:50.033 --> 37:52.466
That's a basketball player?

37:52.467 --> 37:53.866
Jesus!

37:53.867 --> 37:57.032
That makes me even hornier
than the picture of a cyclist.

38:00.033 --> 38:03.332
Oh my shit, he is fine!

38:03.333 --> 38:05.999
What the fuck is in his shorts?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.799
That was just a shocking
moment of television.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.799
It was ferocious
and full of electricity.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.532
It was... felicity.

38:25.033 --> 38:26.366
When you put a crazy person

38:26.367 --> 38:28.132
in charge of the Tour de France,

38:28.133 --> 38:29.932
crazy things will happen.

38:29.933 --> 38:33.165
That was Ditmer Perten.
Was that "Perten"?

38:33.166 --> 38:34.599
That was Ditman Kirkman.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.065
That was Ditmar Perper.

38:37.066 --> 38:39.599
I mean, how the fuck do you say this
guy's name? What was his name again?

38:39.600 --> 38:41.999
That was Ditman Klerker.
That was Ditman Klerken.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.432
That was Ditmar Klerken.
Ditmen Klirken.

38:44.433 --> 38:46.999
Ditman Klerker... Klerken.
Ditmen Klerken.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.633
Ditman Klerker. Ditmen Klerken.
Did I get it?

38:49.634 --> 38:51.733
Ditmen Klerken.
Ditmen Klerken.

38:51.734 --> 38:54.499
That's his name, okay.
But he was crazy, though.

38:58.767 --> 39:01.466
Well, Tour's over.

39:01.467 --> 39:03.600
Time to go kill myself.
