00:04.296 --> 00:05.673
<i>It's typical for young people</i>

00:05.756 --> 00:07.633
<i>to admire rock stars.</i>

00:07.717 --> 00:10.970
<i>For my sister,
it was Cyndi Lauper.</i>

00:13.389 --> 00:15.391
<i>For my brother,
it was Bon Jovi.</i>

00:15.474 --> 00:16.809
Well, Jon, we look good.

00:16.892 --> 00:19.645
<i>♪♪ Oh, livin' on... ♪♪</i>

00:21.063 --> 00:25.151
<i>For me, the rock star
I admired most was...</i>

00:25.234 --> 00:27.278
<i>Albert Einstein.</i>

00:29.697 --> 00:32.908
Did you know Einstein
loved playing the violin?

00:32.992 --> 00:34.952
- So?
- He believed music

00:35.036 --> 00:36.996
helped him formulate
his theories.

00:37.455 --> 00:38.456
So?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.207
Einstein was arguably
the greatest

00:40.291 --> 00:42.293
scientific mind
of the 20th century.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.503
If music helped him,
maybe it could help me.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.047
So?

00:47.381 --> 00:49.258
I got to go talk to my mom.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.052
- Everything okay?
- Yeah,

00:51.135 --> 00:52.863
she's just got some problems
she's dealing with.

00:52.887 --> 00:55.014
Kind of personal.
Will you make the kids lunch?

00:55.097 --> 00:57.016
- Ah, do I have to?
- George?

00:57.099 --> 00:58.267
Happy to.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.810
Be right back.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.689
What do y'all want for lunch?

01:03.773 --> 01:05.316
Peanut butter and jelly, please.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.484
Great. Missy?

01:07.526 --> 01:10.154
Tuna salad on rye toast,

01:10.237 --> 01:11.781
with sliced pickles and...

01:11.864 --> 01:13.574
Two PBJs, got it.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.160
What is going on?

01:16.243 --> 01:18.162
- Well...
- Well, what?

01:18.662 --> 01:20.873
- I'm trying to say it.
- You woke me up.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.458
Spill it or I'm going
back to bed.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.418
I'm pregnant.

01:25.503 --> 01:26.837
I'm awake now.

Are you sure?

01:47.108 --> 01:48.400
Yes. I'm late.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.194
- How late?
- Two days.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.113
Oh, two days.
That's nothing.

01:52.196 --> 01:55.032
Last time I was two days late,
I had the twins.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.868
Last time I was two days late,
I had menopause.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.080
Just trying to lighten the mood.

02:02.832 --> 02:04.250
So do you have...

02:04.333 --> 02:07.294
reason to think
that you might be?

02:07.378 --> 02:09.880
Well, we try to be safe, but...

02:09.964 --> 02:11.841
you know, heat of the moment.

02:11.924 --> 02:14.593
Still? After three kids
and that beer belly

02:14.677 --> 02:16.345
- hanging over his pants?
- Mom?

02:17.555 --> 02:19.890
I think you might be getting way
ahead of yourself.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.184
I'm telling you, I just know.

02:22.268 --> 02:25.980
You were also convinced
that Georgie was gonna be a girl.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.315
That's true.

02:28.399 --> 02:31.235
Although he does have
very pretty hair.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.157
- Hello.
- Hi, Sheldon.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.117
I'd like to learn to play
the violin.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.702
Really?

02:39.785 --> 02:41.620
Well, that's terrific.

02:41.704 --> 02:44.331
Do you have any experience
with stringed instruments?

02:44.415 --> 02:46.000
Stringed instruments, no.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.751
String theory, yes.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.922
That was a joke.
I'm a joker.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.300
I think I have an old violin
you can take home

02:54.383 --> 02:55.426
and get the feel of.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.844
That's great.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.304
Thank you.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.388
But I have to warn you,

02:59.471 --> 03:01.515
it can be a frustrating
instrument to learn.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.392
- Can you play it?
- Yes.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.727
I'll be fine.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.114
I don't see them.

03:17.907 --> 03:18.908
Excuse me.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.618
Where do you keep
your pregnancy tests?

03:20.701 --> 03:23.329
- Mom.
- Behind the counter at the pharmacy.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.830
Thank you.

03:24.914 --> 03:26.832
Would you please be
a little more discreet?

03:26.916 --> 03:28.542
She doesn't know it's for you.

03:28.626 --> 03:30.544
Well, it sure isn't for you.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.254
Come on.

03:32.338 --> 03:34.215
Ow. No.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.424
Well, go ahead.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.176
- I can't.
- Why not?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.886
His daughter goes
to Missy's school.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.138
You are being ridiculous.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.307
I don't need the world
knowing my business.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.558
Okay, fine.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.228
- Hello!
- Oh.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.271
Excuse me.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.023
- Hi, can I help you?
- Yes.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.567
Uh, I need a...
pregnancy test.

03:53.651 --> 03:54.651
Sure.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.736
We have a few options.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.321
Hey, Connie.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.573
Oh, hey, Brenda.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.200
Oh, you-you pick.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.701
Is that a pregnancy test?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.412
Uh, yeah.

04:05.496 --> 04:06.622
It's for me.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.667
- Really?
- Yes.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.294
I come from a long line
of really fertile women.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.463
My mother had me
when she was 57.

04:14.546 --> 04:15.589
Can you believe it?

04:15.673 --> 04:17.632
I don't think I can.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.134
Dr. Sturgis and I
have been dating

04:19.218 --> 04:21.303
for some time
and we really try to be careful,

04:21.387 --> 04:23.973
but you know how it is.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.683
Heat of the moment.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.143
Hi, Mrs. Cooper!

04:30.020 --> 04:31.021
Hi, Billy.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.982
Are you playing
hide-and-seek?

04:33.482 --> 04:35.192
Um, yeah.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.778
Don't tell anybody. Shh.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.280
Bye, Mrs. Cooper!

04:39.363 --> 04:40.614
Oh...

04:40.698 --> 04:44.076
Thank you so much. Bye.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.412
Wish me luck.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.666
It's a bit worn.
But it's fine for a beginner.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.588
That was unpleasant.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.799
It just takes some practice.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.135
Very well.
When is my first lesson?

05:01.677 --> 05:03.762
I'm... pretty busy
right now.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.724
But I can give you
this in the meantime.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.893
<i>Anyone Can Play Violin.</i>

05:10.436 --> 05:11.895
They don't set the bar very high.

05:14.732 --> 05:16.483
<i>You know what you need to do?</i>

05:16.567 --> 05:17.693
<i>Yes.</i>

05:20.029 --> 05:21.488
How's it going?

05:21.572 --> 05:24.158
<i>It'd be a lot easier to pee
if you'd stop talking.</i>

05:24.241 --> 05:25.909
Sorry.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.498
<i>Now it's too quiet.
Say something.</i>

05:33.709 --> 05:35.961
I know you didn't expect this,

05:36.045 --> 05:38.922
and you still might not be,
but...

05:39.006 --> 05:42.134
but if it turns out you are...

05:42.217 --> 05:44.511
I'm here for you.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.889
<i>Thanks, Mom.</i>

05:46.972 --> 05:49.433
<i>You're not the one
I'm worried about.</i>

05:49.516 --> 05:52.061
If I'm pregnant,
George is gonna flip out.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.688
I'm sure he would at first.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.774
Then he would
calm down.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.651
Take a few beers.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.363
Maybe some malt liquor.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.948
I suppose.

06:05.783 --> 06:08.369
The truth is,
he and I were both

06:08.452 --> 06:10.204
freaked out
about having twins.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.165
But now I can't imagine
life without them.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.125
Well, see,
there you are.

06:15.209 --> 06:19.254
So, no matter what
that test says,

06:19.338 --> 06:21.173
you're gonna be okay.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.674
You're right.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.927
What's it say?

06:27.137 --> 06:29.139
I'm gonna go
buy that malt liquor.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.147
<i>To get started,
place your violin</i>

06:37.231 --> 06:40.651
<i>in rest position.
Your feet should be together.</i>

06:40.734 --> 06:43.362
<i>Your right arm should be
over your instrument,</i>

06:43.445 --> 06:46.615
<i>not touching the strings
or the bridge.</i>

06:47.574 --> 06:49.334
<i>- Put your left hand...</i>
- What are you doing?

06:49.368 --> 06:50.452
What does it look like?

06:50.536 --> 06:53.497
Like you're looking for another
excuse for kids to pick on you.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.833
<i>Now, you are ready
to position your feet.</i>

06:55.916 --> 06:58.252
<i>Zip your feet open
and step forward</i>

06:58.335 --> 07:00.963
<i>with your left foot.</i>

07:01.046 --> 07:02.565
<i>- Your feet should...</i>
- What are you doing?

07:02.589 --> 07:05.551
I was gonna watch <i>DuckTales,</i>
but this looks funnier.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.011
<i>...procedure for positioning
the violin on your shoulder.</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:10.764
<i>Hold your violin
above the left foot</i>

07:10.848 --> 07:12.933
<i>with the neck
of the instrument pointing up.</i>

07:13.475 --> 07:15.018
Left foot, neck up.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.770
<i>Now rotate the neck
of the instrument</i>

07:16.854 --> 07:19.398
<i>counterclockwise,
so that the neck points</i>

07:19.481 --> 07:21.066
<i>at your left foot.</i>

07:21.150 --> 07:24.111
- Oh, boy.
- I was right.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.946
<i>Bend your left elbow
so that the violin</i>

07:26.029 --> 07:27.906
<i>rests on your shoulder</i>

07:27.990 --> 07:29.783
<i>and place your head
on the chin rest.</i>

07:29.867 --> 07:32.870
<i>Now try dropping your left hand.</i>

07:32.953 --> 07:34.313
<i>See if you can
hold your instrument</i>

07:34.371 --> 07:36.248
without your hands.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.333
<i>- Time yourself at this...</i>
- What's going on?

07:38.417 --> 07:41.128
I'm learning to play the violin.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.005
It's my new favorite show.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.382
<i>Once you feel you have control
of your instrument,</i>

07:45.466 --> 07:48.427
<i>try moving your hands around.</i>

07:56.602 --> 07:58.437
<i>Repeat this procedure
until you can position</i>

07:58.520 --> 08:01.106
<i>your instrument
comfortably and quickly.</i>

08:06.695 --> 08:08.071
He'll just be another minute.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.198
Thank you.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.621
- What's that about?
- Oh...

08:15.704 --> 08:18.499
just trying not
to breathe the smoke in.

08:18.582 --> 08:19.958
Come on.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.419
It already went through
the filter and my lungs.

08:22.503 --> 08:25.547
This stuff is squeaky clean.

08:25.631 --> 08:26.840
Well, still.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.385
He's all yours,
your highness.

08:30.469 --> 08:31.887
All right.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.058
Hey, Mare, what's up?
Other than the big guy.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.227
God joke.

08:38.309 --> 08:42.813
Actually, um,
I could use some guidance.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.274
I got some news today,

08:44.358 --> 08:47.152
and I'm not quite sure
how I feel about it.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.404
Of course. Sit.

08:52.950 --> 08:56.036
Well... I am...

08:56.787 --> 08:58.413
um...

08:59.039 --> 09:00.082
with child.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.583
That's wonderful!

09:01.667 --> 09:05.212
Congratulations!
How far along are you?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.214
Uh, could you keep it down
just a little?

09:07.297 --> 09:08.632
I haven't exactly
told George yet.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.926
Got it. And why not?

09:11.009 --> 09:12.344
It is his, right?

09:12.928 --> 09:14.471
Of course.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.681
Apologies.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.766
Hey, I'm a pastor
in a small town.

09:17.849 --> 09:21.144
You wouldn't believe
the juicy things I hear.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.566
This just wasn't
part of our plan.

09:25.649 --> 09:28.235
Well, luckily...
it's part of God's plan.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.404
And let me tell you
about another Mary

09:30.487 --> 09:33.156
who didn't know how to tell
her husband she was expecting.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.159
And her story is way
weirder than yours.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.373
<i>In order to practice this,
move your bow</i>

09:41.456 --> 09:44.710
<i>in a counterclockwise direction.</i>

09:45.252 --> 09:48.463
<i>Keep your hand moving right
with the tip of the bow.</i>

09:48.547 --> 09:51.008
<i>For our next song,
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"</i>

09:51.091 --> 09:54.052
<i>remember posture
is our most important thing.</i>

09:54.136 --> 09:55.554
<i>Set, play.</i>

10:08.191 --> 10:10.360
Did you hear that?
I did it.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.945
I don't think you did.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.782
And now we see how
it helps my science.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.368
Hmm.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.871
Hmm...

10:24.916 --> 10:26.501
Come on, think.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.672
Probably needs more
"Twinkle, Twinkle."

10:30.756 --> 10:31.923
<i>...for learning new songs.</i>

10:32.007 --> 10:33.925
<i>You can play them
along with me.</i>

10:43.185 --> 10:44.645
What the hell is that?

10:45.687 --> 10:47.606
Sheldon's learning
to play the violin.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.941
Oh. Well, that's
unfortunate.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.068
Mm-hmm.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.153
I'm gonna go change.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.701
Hey, Dad. Can you believe
I only started playing today?

10:59.785 --> 11:01.828
I really can.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.801
Hey, so there's something

11:15.884 --> 11:17.636
I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

11:17.719 --> 11:18.845
Sure, what's up?

11:19.388 --> 11:22.265
Now, before I say it, um...

11:22.766 --> 11:25.602
I want to tell you a story
of another Mary.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.312
Um...

11:27.396 --> 11:29.022
Okay, anytime...

11:29.106 --> 11:31.483
<i>Are you kidding me?!</i>

11:31.566 --> 11:33.110
Keep your voice down.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.195
Are you kidding me?

11:35.278 --> 11:37.256
Look, I was a little thrown,
too, but Pastor Jeff said...

11:37.280 --> 11:38.907
Pastor Jeff?

11:38.990 --> 11:40.701
Pastor Jeff knows before me?

11:40.784 --> 11:43.537
Well, yeah,
I needed someone to talk to,

11:43.620 --> 11:45.455
- and, you know, my mom...
- Your mom?!

11:45.539 --> 11:48.333
- Shh!
- Does the whole damn town know?

11:48.417 --> 11:50.877
No. Just my mom and Pastor Jeff.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.172
And maybe Brenda Sparks.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.968
Probably Peg...

11:58.552 --> 11:59.678
and whoever she told,

11:59.761 --> 12:01.888
- but that is it.
- Oh, is that it?

12:01.972 --> 12:04.099
<i>Great news!</i>

12:04.182 --> 12:05.350
Not a good time, Sheldon.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.144
<i>But it's really important.</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:08.562
Ugh.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.692
I figured out why the violin
worked for Einstein

12:13.775 --> 12:15.235
and not for me.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.612
I need to become
a Jewish person.

12:24.703 --> 12:27.414
<i>- Sheldon, dinner!
- Coming!</i>

12:30.125 --> 12:32.753
Sorry I'm late.
Shalom.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.424
What's on your head?

12:37.507 --> 12:40.177
- A yarmulke.
- A yama-what?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.595
It's a special Jewish hat.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.431
It reminds the wearer
that God is always over you.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.184
Mom.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.019
Oh, come on, it's funny.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.771
It's not funny
and it's not a yarmulke.

12:50.854 --> 12:54.775
It is a coaster I crocheted
at Bible camp.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.318
Are you gonna say
something to him?

12:56.943 --> 12:59.321
Normally I would, but I got
bigger problems right now.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.034
- Let's just say grace.
- Hold on.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.119
Are these
hot dogs kosher?

13:11.666 --> 13:13.001
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

13:13.084 --> 13:14.920
<i>I continued to play the violin</i>

13:15.003 --> 13:18.590
<i>in an effort to replicate
the mental prowess of Einstein.</i>

13:19.257 --> 13:21.885
<i>I was asked to confine
my practice to the garage</i>

13:21.968 --> 13:25.096
<i>by my father, mother,
sister and brother.</i>

13:25.180 --> 13:27.432
<i>Meemaw was fine with me
practicing in the house,</i>

13:27.516 --> 13:29.893
<i>but why would she care?
She doesn't live with us.</i>

13:32.479 --> 13:33.480
Hey, George.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.440
Hey, Herschel.

13:35.524 --> 13:36.793
Let me guess.
You're here to complain

13:36.817 --> 13:38.360
about Sheldon's violin playing.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.529
Well, under normal circumstances,
I'd say yeah,

13:40.612 --> 13:41.863
but since he started,

13:41.947 --> 13:45.033
my chickens been
dropping eggs like crazy.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.869
- That's weird.
- Hey, uh,

13:47.953 --> 13:50.288
I hear congratulations
are in order.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.790
What's that you hear?

13:51.873 --> 13:54.084
Maybe I didn't hear it.
Never mind.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.210
It's all right.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.671
Seems like everybody knows.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.090
You don't seem
terribly enthusiastic.

14:01.550 --> 14:03.552
It's the money, Herschel.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.095
It's all about the money.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.348
Well, there's only one
solution to that.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.434
- Which is?
- You got to make more money.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.478
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.398
Hey, I got to ask,
did that fiddle playing

14:16.481 --> 14:18.608
increase the fertility
in all the females

14:18.692 --> 14:21.653
around here or just my chickens?

14:21.736 --> 14:24.197
I was just throwing it out there,
never mind.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.575
Wait here,
I'm-a go get you some eggs.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.244
- That's okay.
- You're getting eggs.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.954
Guess I'm getting eggs.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.291
<i>All right, George,</i>

14:34.374 --> 14:37.043
- what's so damn important?
- Well...

14:37.127 --> 14:39.629
I don't want to get into
the why's and wherefore's,

14:39.713 --> 14:42.215
but I'm gonna
need a raise.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.925
Is this 'cause Mary's pregnant?

14:44.593 --> 14:46.052
You got to be kidding me.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.346
Does everybody in this damn town
know my business?

14:48.430 --> 14:50.307
I just... it was taking a guess.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.517
- Tom.
- My wife told me.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.146
Doesn't matter.
What do you say?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.481
Are you threatening to quit
if you don't get it?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.276
- No, Tom, I'm threatening to rob a bank.
- Okay.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.028
All right, well,
let's not do that.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.781
$100 a week do the trick?

15:07.324 --> 15:09.159
Yes. Thanks. Bye.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.250
<i>Temple Judea.</i>

15:17.334 --> 15:18.335
<i>How can I help you?</i>

15:18.418 --> 15:20.337
Hello. I'd like
to become Jewish.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.172
Who would be in charge of that?

15:22.255 --> 15:23.548
<i>How old are you?</i>

15:23.632 --> 15:24.633
I'm ten.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.259
<i>Please hold.</i>

15:31.973 --> 15:34.059
<i>Hello, this is
Rabbi Schneiderman.</i>

15:34.142 --> 15:35.560
To whom am I speaking?

15:35.644 --> 15:37.520
Hello, this is Sheldon Cooper.

15:37.604 --> 15:41.107
Hello, Sheldon.
Um, how can I help you?

15:41.191 --> 15:44.903
I'm currently a Baptist
and I'd like to convert to Judaism.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.530
A Baptist named Sheldon.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.324
Okay.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.576
And why do you want to convert?

15:51.660 --> 15:54.788
Very simple. It's my intention
to become a great scientist,

15:54.871 --> 15:57.207
and I couldn't help but notice
most of the great scientists

15:57.290 --> 16:01.419
are Jewish, so logic dictates
it's time to switch teams.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.129
Well, I'm sure there are

16:03.213 --> 16:06.299
many Baptist scientists
you could emulate.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.676
<i>That's kind of you to say,</i>

16:07.759 --> 16:10.136
but other than Cornelis Drebbel
in the 1500s,

16:10.220 --> 16:11.680
it's pretty slim pickings.

16:13.431 --> 16:16.184
Well, Sheldon, you sound like
a very smart young man.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.978
Oh, you have no idea.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.814
Can I ask how your parents
feel about this?

16:20.897 --> 16:23.233
Well, when I presented them
with my plan,

16:23.316 --> 16:25.235
the words "over my dead body"
were used.

16:27.237 --> 16:28.571
I'm not surprised.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.448
But they were
similarly resistant

16:30.532 --> 16:32.117
when I wanted to get an ant farm

16:32.200 --> 16:33.910
and eventually they came around.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.998
All right, here's what
I'm gonna tell you to do.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.457
Read your Bible.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.334
Already did, cover to cover.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.253
<i>- Really?</i>
- Quiz me.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.214
No, that's okay.
I believe you.

16:46.756 --> 16:50.010
All right, my advice to you

16:50.093 --> 16:53.013
is to stay with the faith
of your parents.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.348
- What else you got?
<i>- Okay.</i>

16:55.432 --> 16:57.434
Then I'm gonna tell you

16:57.934 --> 16:59.686
to be your own man.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.856
But I want to be a great
scientist like Albert Einstein.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.023
<i>Sheldon,</i>

17:04.107 --> 17:05.817
when your days are over,

17:06.401 --> 17:09.279
God will never ask you,

17:09.362 --> 17:11.448
"Why weren't you Einstein?"

17:12.781 --> 17:14.659
But he might ask you,

17:15.910 --> 17:17.996
"Why weren't you Sheldon?"

17:26.421 --> 17:28.464
What's going on? You all right?

17:29.591 --> 17:31.134
I'm not feeling great.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.635
Is it a pregnant thing?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.971
'Cause I got
some good news on that.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.599
I got a decent raise.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.267
It doesn't matter.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.750
What do you mean,
it doesn't matter?

17:40.810 --> 17:42.479
We can pull this off now.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.024
I lost the baby.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.154
Oh.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.501
You're probably relieved, huh?

18:05.794 --> 18:07.420
Actually...

18:09.589 --> 18:11.049
...no.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.182
I love the first three.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.351
Fourth one's the charm, right?

18:26.272 --> 18:27.857
<i>Dad?</i>

18:27.941 --> 18:29.567
<i>Mom?</i>

18:32.320 --> 18:34.322
Yeah, Shelly?

18:34.405 --> 18:37.617
I just thought you should know
I'm not going to be Jewish.

18:37.700 --> 18:41.371
I'm going to remain the atheist
Baptist you've come to love.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.458
Good to hear.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.252
Are you crying?

18:49.504 --> 18:52.465
Yeah, but don't worry.
Everything's okay.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.261
Good.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.519
<i>Once again,
I brought my mother so much joy</i>

19:04.602 --> 19:07.897
<i>she was moved to tears.
I don't know how I do it.</i>

19:14.571 --> 19:16.531
<i>Tom,
George Cooper's here for you.</i>

19:16.614 --> 19:18.324
Send him in.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.702
Hey, Tom, you got a minute?

19:20.785 --> 19:22.704
Pretty busy.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.372
Make it quick.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.792
It turns out I don't
need that raise.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.419
What happened,
you win the lottery?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.546
No, no.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.888
Aw, George, I am so sorry.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.557
Well, what can you do?

19:43.975 --> 19:45.643
Listen, I cleared
your raise already.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.103
Why don't you just
keep the money.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.189
- Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
- No.

19:49.272 --> 19:52.025
No, I mean it. It's yours.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.403
Okay.

19:55.486 --> 19:56.905
Thanks. Bye.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.244
Thank you, but I will
no longer be needing these.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.038
You're giving up
so soon?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.122
What happened?

20:06.206 --> 20:07.665
- Did it hurt your fingers?
- No.

20:07.749 --> 20:10.543
I'm following the advice of
a very wise Rabbi Schneiderman

20:10.627 --> 20:12.462
from Temple Judea in Houston.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.381
Is this another one
of your jokes?

20:15.465 --> 20:17.842
No. If it were a joke,
your mouth would be open

20:17.926 --> 20:20.136
and the sound "ha-ha"
would be coming out.
