WEBVTT

01:04.522 --> 01:09.068
Come on! Put it to the floor!
Come on! Let's go!

01:12.322 --> 01:13.614
Go, go!

01:21.290 --> 01:23.499
You got this thing in second.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.293
Here we go.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.379
Pull over!

01:28.464 --> 01:29.797
Pull over.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.224
- Get over.
- Slow down.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.685
Slow down.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.156
Come on.

01:56.492 --> 01:57.617
Open up.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.000
Defenders of the nation,
I bid thee a fine farewell.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.503
Make a million, buddy!

02:55.259 --> 02:58.177
Mike, looky there!

02:59.012 --> 03:00.054
Look at that.

03:00.556 --> 03:03.140
Look at that.
See that city out there, kid?

03:03.225 --> 03:05.017
One day we're gonna own that town.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.019
You and me.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.938
What do you think of that?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.859
Smart kid.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.671
Next stop, Martin Boulevard.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.309
Hey!

04:28.810 --> 04:31.103
Uncle Pat, you'd better be careful

04:31.188 --> 04:32.540
or you're gonna
throw that back out again.

04:32.564 --> 04:36.859
Don't worry, I can handle it.
So, home from the wars, huh?

04:38.987 --> 04:41.072
- How you doin'?
- Oh, I'm fine.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.741
Servicing all the widows
in the neighborhood now.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.409
Same ol' Uncle Pat.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.163
Flat beer from rusty pipes.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.583
If you only knew how I missed it.

04:52.668 --> 04:55.647
You might have changed a lot, but they
sure didn't beat the wise guy out of you.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.963
Not a chance of that.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.506
I saved the apartment for you.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.467
I sublet it to a couple of yuppies.
They loved your mother's furniture.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.678
They said it was quaint.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.806
I still remember the day
they came to repossess it.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.838
So what are you going to do now?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.272
Make a million.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.775
In the meantime,
I'll ask McDougal to give you a job.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.527
No way!

05:19.820 --> 05:21.260
It was good enough for your old man.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.197
So was arthritis.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.283
He supported a family,
just like you're gonna have to do.

05:26.368 --> 05:29.745
No, not me.
I'm not falling into that trap.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.748
Every man wakes up one fine morning
with the wife and kids.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.584
"Where'd they come from?
They weren't there last time I looked."

05:35.669 --> 05:38.004
That's 'cause most things in life,
good and bad,

05:38.088 --> 05:39.964
just kind of happen to you.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.925
I'm gonna make things happen for me.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.802
Sure you will.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.137
That'll be a buck for the beer.

05:49.099 --> 05:54.520
What? Your nephew comes home
from serving his country

05:54.604 --> 05:56.647
and he doesn't even rate
a beer on the house?

05:56.732 --> 05:58.441
You don't get rich
giving things away.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.900
Oh! How do you get rich?

06:00.110 --> 06:03.362
I'm gonna give you your first lesson.
On the house.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.741
I've been here 25 years,
never bought a drink.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.242
Right, Eddie?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.660
I can testify to that!

06:09.786 --> 06:13.539
In 1 969, the Mets won the World Series.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.960
Eddie here starts pounding on the bar,
demanding a round on the house.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.545
"Drinks for everybody," he says.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.672
Tell him what I did.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.799
He whacked me with a club.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.343
Almost knocked the eye out of my head.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.708
That's your way of making money?

06:28.180 --> 06:31.182
Outwork, outthink,
out scheme and out maneuver.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.684
You make no friends.
Trust nobody.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.978
You make damn sure
you're the smartest guy in the room

06:36.063 --> 06:38.606
whenever the subject of money
comes up.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.358
I don't know, Uncle Pat...

06:41.443 --> 06:43.486
It doesn't sound like
too much fun to me.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.447
Fun? You want fun,
go play at the beach.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.532
I think I'll try the city first.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.994
Here. This'll get you there in style.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.790
Ooh! $1 0, Uncle Pat.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.584
Why don't you buy Eddie
a binge on me, huh?

07:00.128 --> 07:02.588
Eddie, you gotta be quicker than that.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.450
I've always wanted to
work on Wall Street.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.494
I read the Journal.
I know what's going on.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.746
I'll do whatever it takes to succeed.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.248
I appreciate that, Flanagan,

07:37.332 --> 07:39.583
but all our professionals
have college degrees.

07:39.668 --> 07:40.793
I catch on pretty quick.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.628
You're wasting your time.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.796
We're not interested.

07:43.880 --> 07:48.134
A guy like you, advertising.
I have a feel for advertising.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.636
I can look at an ad
and tell you what's wrong with it.

07:50.720 --> 07:55.599
- We need solid credentials.
- A marketing degree is a prerequisite.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.725
Try the networks.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.664
In the Army, I spent a lot of time in
communications. I think I can help you.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.106
We need somebody
who can hit the ground running.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.525
Maybe in six or eight months, but...

08:04.609 --> 08:06.318
You should pursue other avenues.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.653
Maybe you should reenlist.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.073
I believe in positive thinking.
Never quit. Never say die.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.658
I want to be part of a team.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.243
So, what do you think?

08:15.036 --> 08:17.371
Your résumé's completely inadequate.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.189
I'm willing to start at the bottom.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.333
- You're aiming too high.
- I'll do anything.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.127
You don't have experience.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.545
I need a job.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.796
We value education.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.340
- We require a degree.
- You should go to college.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.083
Bar's closed, pal.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.252
I'm looking for the manager.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.504
What's the matter?

09:07.589 --> 09:09.089
Find a hair in your quiche?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.093
No, I'm looking for a job.

09:13.178 --> 09:17.264
I see, you want
to put a hair in somebody else's quiche.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.433
- Did you get canned?
- I'm looking.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.894
Looking for something better.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.896
Coughlin's law.

09:24.439 --> 09:27.650
Anything else is
always something better.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.318
Coughlin's law?

09:29.611 --> 09:32.529
Douglas Coughlin, logical negativist.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.366
Flourished at the end of
the 20th century.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.369
Propounded a set of laws
that the world generally ignored...

09:38.453 --> 09:41.205
to its detriment. Me.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.958
Ever work behind a bar?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.460
My uncle's in the business.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.255
Know how to make a Red-eye, Mr...?

09:49.339 --> 09:53.717
Brian Flanagan.
No, I haven't had the pleasure as yet.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.762
How about a Vodka martini
with a Pernod float?

09:57.389 --> 09:59.056
I'm a fast learner.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.894
Could you throw
a 400-pound psychopath out the bar?

10:03.979 --> 10:06.021
I guess I could if I had to.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.441
What about a 1 00-pound ballerina
that's been speeding for three days?

10:09.526 --> 10:12.111
Open the door and let her pirouette out?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.991
These are just some of the tasks
you'll be asked to perform.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.536
This is the Upper East Side,
saloon capital of the world.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.872
You're ready for the big time,
young Mr. Flanagan.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.168
I think I can handle it.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.424
Get your act together!

10:33.508 --> 10:34.883
Vodka and Rose's, please.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.969
I got four people waiting for me.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.804
I'm not going back there
with three drinks.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.055
I'm coming.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.181
Absolut on the rocks,

10:41.266 --> 10:43.767
Gilbey's and tonic
and a Velvet Hammer.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.937
- This isn't what I ordered!
- A Molson and a Cuba Libre.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.648
- What was that?
- A Molson and a Cuba Libre.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.192
And I don't want it in spurts.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.237
What is this?
Hire the handicapped week?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.324
If you're gonna sit in the water,
go to Coney Island.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.118
You want me to bite the top off this?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.494
This has got recipes.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.663
Ordering a Cuba Libre!

11:04.748 --> 11:06.290
Can I please
have a glass of water?

11:06.374 --> 11:07.666
He doesn't know how to make it.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.293
Where's my Jim Beam on the rocks?

11:09.377 --> 11:13.464
- It's coming. In a minute.
- I'm not leaving till I get my Cuba Libre.

11:13.548 --> 11:17.384
- Can I have an Orgasm?
- This isn't what I ordered.

11:17.969 --> 11:18.969
A white wine.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.679
You bitch!

11:20.764 --> 11:23.265
Why didn't you just tell me
it was a rum and Coke?

11:23.350 --> 11:24.683
Can I have what I ordered?

11:24.768 --> 11:26.143
- A Bloody Mary.
- An Angel Tit.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.353
A white wine.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.771
Pink Squirrel.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.397
- A Friar Tuck.
- A Ding-A-Ling.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.149
A white wine.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.776
- Pink Squirrel.
- Angel Tit.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.403
- Dirty Mother.
- Can I have what I ordered?

11:36.488 --> 11:40.157
All right! What was it that you ordered?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.658
A martini.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.577
What's in that?

11:57.926 --> 12:00.636
You get 1 0 percent from the waitresses.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.804
I don't deserve it.

12:01.888 --> 12:05.724
Hey, schmuck. You get money
from girls every day?

12:05.809 --> 12:07.893
Listen, I'm sorry I called you a bitch.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.312
Why? I am a bitch.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.858
Got yourself a new disciple?

12:14.943 --> 12:16.693
Good night, my beautiful.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.738
Hey, frogman.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.783
Anyone who can get money out of her
is a major talent.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.619
Come back next Thursday.
I've got five shifts open.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.746
- You're offering me a job?
- Uh-huh.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.291
The waitresses hate me.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.547
Wait till you've given them crabs.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.841
Then you'll really know hatred.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.276
L'd like to discuss

12:57.360 --> 12:59.278
the demand for money
by focusing on...

12:59.362 --> 13:00.654
the money multiplier.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.700
Add increases in currency,
deposits, reserves and bank credits.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.743
Then we have the sum of
an infinite series.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.371
Adding these components together,

13:09.456 --> 13:12.958
we find that they add up
to one plus CU over CU plus RE.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.627
That, simply stated,
is the money multiplier.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.171
Now, moving on...

13:17.672 --> 13:20.132
The essential technique of bartending:

13:20.216 --> 13:22.301
Less is more.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.136
The less you pour, the more you score.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.763
The boss does better, we do better.

13:26.848 --> 13:27.890
And the customer?

13:27.974 --> 13:30.100
Think of a customer
as a hurdler thinks of a hurdle.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.602
A means to an end.

13:31.686 --> 13:35.564
We dazzle him with ice work.
We baffle him with bottle work.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.442
There are many ways to
fool a customer.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.486
The short pour.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.447
The long pour.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.116
The ice mountain. The spring thaw.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.494
The speed rack shuffle. The hot shot.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.871
You will learn them all.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.915
Yes, Obi-Wan.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.958
Both hands. Ladies, come on.

13:55.043 --> 13:58.128
Okay, ready?
One, two, three. Let go!

14:02.967 --> 14:04.051
What does it mean?

14:04.219 --> 14:06.553
What does it mean? Nothing!

14:06.888 --> 14:08.555
Nothing?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.557
All right! Nothing!

14:11.601 --> 14:12.601
Whoa!

14:15.563 --> 14:17.814
Very sophisticated, man.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.191
- Good joke.
- You're crazy.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.407
You got talent.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.248
Let's go with the drinks.
We're making money tonight.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.458
Let's make
some money for a change.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.836
Ice!

14:39.921 --> 14:42.214
- Catch!
- Thank you.

14:42.507 --> 14:45.217
I guess that's what you learned
in college, right?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.983
What buns! See?

15:01.109 --> 15:03.151
Don't forget my beers, Bri.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.115
Missed me!

15:10.285 --> 15:11.868
The name of the game is woman.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.079
The little darlings come in here panting.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.872
Their hearts are pitter-pattering

15:15.957 --> 15:18.792
for the handsome,
all-knowing bartender.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.752
And in their wake,

15:20.837 --> 15:22.337
a parade of slobbering geeks,

15:22.422 --> 15:26.008
with one hand on their crotches
and the other hand on their wallets.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.759
You get the women,
and you get the bucks.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.304
Boy, oh, boy, you've got them.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.347
Buttons were popping,
skirts were rising.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.101
When you can see the color of their
panties, you know you've got talent.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.230
Stick with me, son.
I'll make you a star.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.065
Thanks, man,
but I gotta be honest,

15:42.650 --> 15:45.319
this is just a part-time gig for me.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.238
I'm in a business program,
city college, days.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.657
Ah! A seeker of wisdom and truth.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.621
This is the best work study program
you can find.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.582
To a future leader ofAmerica...

15:58.666 --> 15:59.958
I'll stick with the brew.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.419
Beer is
for breakfast around here.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.338
Drink or be gone.

16:13.181 --> 16:17.434
I realize I've got a class
of budding capitalists here.

16:17.518 --> 16:22.022
That most of you
are seeking the fast track, lovely term,

16:22.148 --> 16:27.277
to a career in investment banking
or some other socially useful pursuit.

16:27.362 --> 16:32.616
Nevertheless, certain antiquated skills
such as reading and writing,

16:32.909 --> 16:35.160
remain a part of the curriculum.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.413
So, for your first assignment,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.666
I'd like you
to write your own obituaries.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.626
Not that I wish you were dead.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.587
At least, not yet, anyway.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.215
"Brian Flanagan...

16:49.133 --> 16:53.845
"Senator Brian Flanagan...
Billionaire Governor Brian Flanagan...

16:53.930 --> 16:57.349
"whose self-propelled meteoric rise
to wealth and fame,

16:57.433 --> 17:01.186
"would have made
even J.D. Rockefeller envious,

17:02.438 --> 17:05.272
"died early yesterday morning
at the age of 99,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.026
"while bedding 1 8-year-old,
seventh wife.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.739
"Heidi, who is recovering from
exhaustion at the local hospital

17:12.824 --> 17:15.909
"and will be
unable to attend the funeral."

17:20.289 --> 17:21.832
For your midterm paper,

17:21.915 --> 17:26.670
I want you to select a business
you are interested in.

17:26.753 --> 17:30.382
And prepare a complete plan
for its development.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.468
You should include capitalization,

17:34.429 --> 17:38.432
administrative costs,
income prospectus,

17:39.600 --> 17:43.311
marketing, cost analysis...

17:44.856 --> 17:48.275
Blue shirt, fifth row, wake up!

17:51.779 --> 17:54.364
Ah! Light dawns on marble head.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.826
Where was I?

17:57.994 --> 18:00.495
Whoo!

18:41.954 --> 18:45.707
I have got serious "fuck me" eyes
coming over here.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.085
Stay in formation. Her old man's
coming in right behind her.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.695
Flanagan, time!

19:16.864 --> 19:18.573
Holy shit.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.748
- Brian?
- Huh?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.375
The bottle.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.130
Try and make it by closing.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.342
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.723
Sexual frustration.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.394
I asked you to prepare a business plan.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.272
A seemingly simple assignment.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.567
And yet,
one word describes your papers.

19:53.651 --> 19:57.195
Bankrupt!

19:57.864 --> 20:00.615
A word some of you will get
to know well in the future.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.702
Like Mr. Ron LeMaster.
Where is Ronnie LeMaster?

20:03.786 --> 20:06.496
Yes. Our cosmetics magnate,

20:06.581 --> 20:10.125
who hopes to make his fortune
selling makeup for pets.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.670
Fetch, Ronnie, fetch.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.171
Good boy.

20:15.256 --> 20:18.592
And my own personal favorite,
Mrs. Sheila Rivkin.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.093
Oh, my God. He's got my paper.

20:20.177 --> 20:24.097
Mrs. Rivkin has spent the last 20 years
burning her husband's dinners,

20:24.181 --> 20:26.266
but now decides she wants to become

20:26.350 --> 20:28.602
the Donald Trump of
the cookie business.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.353
You!

20:30.438 --> 20:32.355
You have something to contribute?

20:33.024 --> 20:34.904
I just said it wasn't worth
getting upset about.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.068
What's your name?

20:37.153 --> 20:38.153
Brian Flanagan.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.531
Speak up!
Let the class hear you.

20:41.616 --> 20:42.699
Brian Flanagan.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.826
Yes, Mr. Flanagan.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.786
Let us see...

20:47.830 --> 20:52.334
Mr. Flanagan is determined
to revolutionize the bar business

20:52.418 --> 20:56.087
by franchising his version
of the local New York tavern

20:56.172 --> 20:58.715
to every suburban shopping mall
in America.

20:58.799 --> 21:03.511
Tell me, do you intend
to provide the smell of stale beer?

21:04.263 --> 21:08.308
Or perhaps a surly bartender
and three boring drunks

21:08.392 --> 21:09.559
to each outlet?

21:09.644 --> 21:11.686
I don't know,
you looking for anotherjob?

21:13.814 --> 21:15.857
Ah! A diamond in the rough.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.818
The dreamer who
can't take the criticism.

21:18.903 --> 21:22.447
Not from a guy who hides here
'cause he can't hack it in the real world.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.455
Let's see how well you hack it in the
real world with an F in this course.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.873
F!

21:34.835 --> 21:38.797
Not a goddamn thing
any one of those professors says

21:38.881 --> 21:41.132
makes a difference on the street.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.094
If you know that,
you're ready to graduate.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.811
Maybe I'm just too old to be a student.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.485
Christ!

22:01.362 --> 22:04.906
I've got to find something to do.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.367
Relax. You're in the perfect job.

22:07.451 --> 22:11.329
There's no better way to make it
than behind three feet of mahogany.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.581
Within one square mile of this saloon,

22:13.666 --> 22:16.209
lies the greatest concentration of wealth
in the world.

22:17.044 --> 22:22.966
Yes, but how is a bartender
going to get his hands on any of it?

22:23.801 --> 22:27.595
A bartender is the aristocrat
of the working class.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.932
He can make all kinds of moves
if he's smart.

22:31.517 --> 22:36.312
There are investors out there.
There are angels. There are suckers.

22:36.397 --> 22:39.858
There are rich women
with nothing to do with their money.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.487
You stand in this bar
and be struck by lightning.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.281
I've seen it happen.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.660
Shall I continue?

22:50.745 --> 22:52.328
Oh, please do.

23:20.024 --> 23:23.359
It is not dignified to get this drunk.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.903
You are in training.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.863
- I'm in training?
- For stardom.

23:26.947 --> 23:27.947
For stardom.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.075
No matter how liberated
this world becomes,

23:30.159 --> 23:34.037
a man will always be judged based on
the amount of alcohol he can consume.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.456
- Always.
- And a woman will be impressed,

23:36.540 --> 23:38.792
whether she likes it or not.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.754
- Now come on.
- I'm not going to make it.

23:42.838 --> 23:47.717
You are! A star never pukes
or passes out in public.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.058
Holy shit.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.436
Hey, are you okay?

24:00.523 --> 24:01.981
You alive?

24:08.989 --> 24:13.493
However, falling down stairs is allowed.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.211
You sure you don't want a slice?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.004
For breakfast? You've got to be joking.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.715
It's better than a Red-eye.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.926
Not for a hangover.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.679
Coughlin's diet.

24:32.763 --> 24:35.306
Cocktails and dreams.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.268
That's not a bad name for a joint.

24:38.352 --> 24:41.104
We really ought to think
about setting up our own place.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.522
That takes money.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.776
The kind of money your sacred books
dangle, but never deliver.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.654
They deliver.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.198
You just got to know how to read.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.495
Come on, we could make a fortune.

24:57.955 --> 25:00.957
That's why you came to New York.
That's sure as hell why I left Queens.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.001
Positive thinking!

25:04.086 --> 25:07.130
We can't let a little thing
like cash stand in our way.

25:07.965 --> 25:13.052
Cocktails and Dreams.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.097
I see it in pink neon.
Blink. Blink.

25:16.432 --> 25:17.849
Pinkity, blink.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.420
That is a little corny, isn't it?

25:19.935 --> 25:21.561
But I could live with it.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.397
Yes, but can I
live with young Flanagan?

25:26.192 --> 25:30.486
Maybe I could handle a partner.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.488
All right!

25:32.573 --> 25:33.615
Fifty-fifty.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.200
A partner who knows his place.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.076
Seventy-thirty.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.581
You do have
your pension to think about,

25:41.665 --> 25:43.833
so I'll settle for sixty-forty.

25:45.753 --> 25:48.588
To health and friendship.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.632
Life and love.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.342
Our future.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.468
To our future.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.511
Let's really do it.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.143
Do it! Do it!

26:03.062 --> 26:04.938
Let's do it!

26:06.774 --> 26:08.524
One, two, three.

26:44.311 --> 26:49.399
Listen, why the fuck are
two stars like you wasting your talents

26:49.483 --> 26:50.566
in a hole like this?

26:50.651 --> 26:51.693
A secret admirer?

26:51.777 --> 26:54.988
I'm serious.
I got the hottest saloon in town.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.906
I want you guys working for me.

26:56.991 --> 26:58.408
In two weeks, you'll be famous.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.119
I've been famous for ten years.
Just give me the money.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.871
I got the hippie hippie shake

27:32.818 --> 27:36.029
I am the world's first yuppie poet.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.032
Bullshit!

27:40.534 --> 27:43.536
My poem is entitled The Bottom Line.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.788
Stick it in your Volvo!

27:45.873 --> 27:48.124
"Money isn't everything,"
They say

27:49.501 --> 27:51.794
Okay, so what is?
Sex?

27:52.504 --> 27:53.796
It's better than sushi!

27:53.881 --> 27:56.174
Did you ever make love
To a pauper?

27:57.593 --> 27:58.968
I'd rather hump a camel!

27:59.053 --> 28:01.179
Revolution?
It takes money

28:01.263 --> 28:04.057
To overthrow the government,
You know

28:04.224 --> 28:05.224
That's deep!

28:05.267 --> 28:08.394
Art? The more it costs,
The better it is

28:08.479 --> 28:10.813
And that's the bottom line!

28:12.399 --> 28:14.233
- Crap, I say!
- Bullshit!

28:14.318 --> 28:17.904
Who wants a drink?

28:22.618 --> 28:24.243
We want more!

28:37.549 --> 28:39.092
You want poets?

28:39.176 --> 28:40.510
Yes, we do!

28:40.594 --> 28:42.428
- You want poets?
- Yeah!

28:43.180 --> 28:46.849
I am the world's last barman poet.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.269
Give us a kiss, you sexy beast!

28:53.315 --> 28:56.234
I see America drinking

28:56.318 --> 28:58.820
The fabulous cocktails I make

28:59.905 --> 29:03.491
America's getting stinking
On something I stir or shake

29:05.160 --> 29:06.953
The Sex on the Beach

29:08.455 --> 29:10.665
The schnapps made from peach

29:10.749 --> 29:13.793
The Velvet Hammer
The Alabama Slammer

29:15.629 --> 29:19.090
I make things with juice
And frothy Pink Squirrel

29:19.174 --> 29:20.758
Three Toad Sloth

29:22.010 --> 29:25.221
I make drinks so sweet and snazzy

29:25.305 --> 29:27.890
The Ice Tea, the Kamikaze

29:30.811 --> 29:32.895
The Orgasm

29:32.980 --> 29:35.022
Hands off the merchandise!

29:36.817 --> 29:38.860
The Death Spasm

29:41.447 --> 29:43.739
The Singapore Sling
The Ding-A-Ling

29:43.824 --> 29:44.907
Ding-A-Ling?

29:44.992 --> 29:47.160
America, you're just devoted

29:47.744 --> 29:49.662
To ever flavor I've got

29:52.291 --> 29:54.584
But if you want to get loaded

29:54.668 --> 29:57.962
Why don't you just order a shot?

30:08.390 --> 30:09.849
Bar's open!

30:17.441 --> 30:19.609
I'd like to try the Orgasm, please.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.196
How many would you like?

30:24.698 --> 30:26.365
- Multiple.
- Multiple?

30:28.452 --> 30:31.996
Then why don't we start
with the Turquoise Blue?

30:33.957 --> 30:35.208
Wow!

30:46.637 --> 30:48.471
You guys are rad!

30:51.099 --> 30:52.517
I'm all shook up

31:01.235 --> 31:02.735
You guys are amazing!

31:12.746 --> 31:14.830
I'm all shook up

31:23.549 --> 31:25.132
Oh, my God!

31:28.011 --> 31:29.303
That was fantastic!

31:29.388 --> 31:30.846
It was great!

31:30.931 --> 31:32.473
You gotta let me take your picture.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.558
What for?

31:33.642 --> 31:36.310
When you're a big celebrity,
I'll put you in Rolling Stone.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.687
- Right.
- He's my protégé.

31:37.771 --> 31:38.938
I discovered him.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.899
That's great. Can you move aside?
I can't fit you both in.

31:42.276 --> 31:44.110
Excuse me.

31:44.194 --> 31:45.278
That's great.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.255
I gotta go.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.925
- Tuesday night?
- I'm working.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.845
So, I'll wait
at the end of the bar till closing.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.681
Isn't that what
all bartenders' girlfriends do?

32:55.766 --> 32:57.224
All right.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.189
- Bye!
- Get in there. You'll catch pneumonia!

33:14.368 --> 33:16.035
Get up! Get out of there!

33:16.119 --> 33:17.536
Back off!

33:19.706 --> 33:21.415
Get up, damn it!

33:22.000 --> 33:23.626
Look at that clown.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.628
Good night, sweet prince.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.131
Looks like one of our customers.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.133
That bum just cost me $50.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.512
What's this great idea
I'm here to piss on?

33:36.932 --> 33:40.810
I have been doing some research

33:40.894 --> 33:44.397
into what it'll cost to set up
Cocktails and Dreams.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.066
What I have found is
if we find the right location.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.984
Do our own renovation.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.987
We can start it up
for as little as $75,000 in cash.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.907
Ah! Which the tooth fairy
will deliver to our doorstep. Hmm?

33:55.575 --> 33:56.701
No, man.

33:57.327 --> 34:02.498
Which we make in Jamaica, man.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.166
I like that. Hmm.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.545
- Jamaica, south of Soho?
- Yeah, man.

34:07.629 --> 34:11.005
Very south of Soho.
The Caribbean Jamaica, man.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.800
I was down there last month
doing a shoot.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.094
I met a bartender
who makes $300 to $400 a day.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.847
A day!

34:17.931 --> 34:19.931
He didn't have
any of talent of you guys.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.184
I should hope not.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.603
Winter in the tropics,
spring in New York.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.440
Jet set bartenders, eh?

34:28.442 --> 34:31.193
We can live for peanuts down there.
There are no taxes.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.027
Cash off the books.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.947
Two, maybe three seasons,
we are in business.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.158
You wanna wait three years?

34:38.076 --> 34:40.828
I've told you,
New York is where the angels are.

34:40.911 --> 34:44.331
This is a real opportunity.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.126
We'll have a fantastic time.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.627
Will we?

34:49.755 --> 34:50.755
Carl, huh?

34:51.214 --> 34:52.255
Coral.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.757
English, Coral.

34:53.842 --> 34:54.884
Coral.

34:56.636 --> 34:57.928
Yes!

34:59.055 --> 35:02.349
Why is it that these chicks are
always named after inanimate objects?

35:02.434 --> 35:05.102
There's nothing inanimate about Coral.

35:05.187 --> 35:06.771
Hot mama, huh?

35:09.858 --> 35:10.983
Good shot.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.234
$1 0 behind the line?

35:13.278 --> 35:14.653
Sure, shoot till you miss.

35:15.322 --> 35:16.739
Where does Coral live?

35:17.991 --> 35:19.408
76th Street.

35:19.493 --> 35:20.993
She's got a brownstone.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.809
She owns the whole fucking building.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.665
You don't think she lives there
all by herself, do you?

35:26.792 --> 35:28.334
That's a bit lucky.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.252
- See any pictures?
- Of guys?

35:30.337 --> 35:31.337
No.

35:34.508 --> 35:35.925
That's $30 you owe me.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.010
- Christ, I know.
- Man's on a roll.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.678
Ladies and gentlemen.

35:39.805 --> 35:43.015
She's been saving herself
for young Flanagan all these years?

35:43.433 --> 35:45.684
Maybe she hides the pictures
when she goes out.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.603
Have a look on her ring finger.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.064
See if there's a white circle
from her wedding band.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.607
Man, are you paranoid!

35:54.194 --> 35:57.696
Listen, it's the difference
between a one-nighter

35:57.781 --> 36:00.533
and a meaningful relationship
with an unattached millionairess.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.409
I'm not thinking about her
that way, okay?

36:02.494 --> 36:04.870
This is more than just
a one-night stand.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.747
This lady's gonna do a number on you,
mate.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.207
I appreciate the concern.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.379
That's $50 you owe me.

36:14.381 --> 36:15.965
$50?

36:16.049 --> 36:20.344
$50 says that Coral's in the sack with
some other guy before the week's out.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.722
That's a bet.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.808
Missed.

36:41.491 --> 36:42.491
Hey.

36:42.576 --> 36:44.535
- How are you?
- Okay. How are you?

37:04.347 --> 37:05.472
Keep it.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.641
Brian!

37:07.726 --> 37:09.059
What'll you have?

37:09.144 --> 37:11.061
- What?
- A Screwdriver.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.274
I take it back,
you're not going to be famous.

37:15.650 --> 37:18.611
Too bad you couldn't keep
your mouth shut about our sex life.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.238
It only gets better.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.829
You made a move on Coral?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.039
I had to get my money back.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.999
You knew how I felt about her.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.084
How you feel anything
for an assembly-line hump

37:34.169 --> 37:35.878
that does the book on the first date?

37:35.962 --> 37:37.356
I did you a favor,
took her off your hands

37:37.380 --> 37:39.298
before she twisted your mind.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.636
You fuckin' son of a bitch!

37:43.720 --> 37:45.804
Coughlin's law:
Never talk about a woman.

37:45.889 --> 37:48.057
She'll hear you no matter
how far away she is.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.684
Come on!

37:51.353 --> 37:53.187
- Can't take the truth?
- Bullshit!

37:53.647 --> 37:56.023
It was nothing but
taking a cheap shot at me.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.127
Where I come from
you don't do that to your friends.

37:58.151 --> 38:01.904
Where you from they're still
saluting the flag and making novenas.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.155
No brawling in here.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.241
That goes for the help as well.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.744
I don't work here anymore.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.579
You wanna cut me, come on!

38:11.957 --> 38:13.248
Cool down, guys.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.501
You'll thank me for this one day.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.003
The fuck I will!

38:22.801 --> 38:24.468
Hey!

39:24.070 --> 39:25.821
Buddy?

39:25.905 --> 39:27.281
Hey, buddy!

39:29.284 --> 39:31.618
The name is not buddy or pal.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.788
The brochure promised me
a drink on the house.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.332
I'll take one of those orange things.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.917
Excuse me.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.670
My friend just passed out on the beach.
Do you have a phone?

39:41.755 --> 39:43.297
No. Excuse me.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.098
She was drinking champagne
in the sun.

39:53.641 --> 39:57.853
Champagne. Perfume going in,
sewage coming out.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.272
- Will she be all right?
- Yeah, she'll be okay.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.149
Could somebody go down
to the condo office

40:02.233 --> 40:03.692
and have them call an ambulance?

40:03.777 --> 40:05.027
Just in case.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.779
Let's get her up.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.762
The doctor will probably give her
a shot of Ipecac.

40:12.786 --> 40:14.244
I don't want any more to drink.

40:15.288 --> 40:18.207
Don't worry. It'll make you feel better.
It'll help you throw up.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.209
I don't want to throw up.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.961
Oh, God. I think I'm gonna throw up.

40:24.714 --> 40:26.965
No, I'm all right.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.968
She can never make up her mind.

40:30.136 --> 40:33.305
- Brian, I gotta hit the road, man.
- Okay.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.353
Well, bye.

40:40.897 --> 40:43.315
It has been an adventure.

40:43.525 --> 40:44.733
Mmm-hmm.

40:46.653 --> 40:47.820
Owen'll take care of you.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.852
Mark, I haven't forgotten about you.

41:20.145 --> 41:23.605
Welcome to my most humble,
dishonorable establishment.

41:23.690 --> 41:25.315
Well, thank you.

41:25.400 --> 41:29.027
My worthless, useless services
are at your disposal.

41:29.612 --> 41:33.240
I want to come by and thank you
for helping out yesterday.

41:33.366 --> 41:34.992
That's all right.
How's she doing?

41:35.076 --> 41:37.452
She has a hangover.

41:39.247 --> 41:42.541
Can I buy you a drink?
One of rum specialties, perhaps.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.042
I'll have a beer.

41:44.127 --> 41:45.460
Beer.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.089
My kind of woman.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.302
Guys.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.266
It seems like happy hour
all day around here.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.393
Yes, happy hour.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.978
That great American invention for

42:03.062 --> 42:05.606
spending quality time
with spouse soused.

42:05.690 --> 42:08.692
A bartender
with a line for everything.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.611
The bartender.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.322
The highest evolution of the species.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.574
Boozus New Yorkus.

42:18.328 --> 42:19.411
Whoa!

42:19.746 --> 42:21.955
I used to work at a circus
before I got this job.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.584
Excuse me.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.699
You wanna see a grown man
cry like a baby?

42:57.784 --> 42:58.784
Hey, bartender.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.495
You know how to make a Red-eye?

43:09.754 --> 43:11.255
What, no tearful greeting?

43:12.632 --> 43:14.299
Coughlin's law.

43:14.425 --> 43:17.886
Never show surprise.
Never lose your cool.

43:18.388 --> 43:19.638
Ah! My sons.

43:19.722 --> 43:21.556
My rebellious sons.

43:21.641 --> 43:23.201
Tell your old buddy how great he looks.

43:26.145 --> 43:30.190
You look like a guy who dyes his hair
and shaves with a Brillo pad.

43:31.025 --> 43:34.278
A guy who gets an erection
on his birthday if the wind is right.

43:34.362 --> 43:35.445
Isn't this great?

43:35.530 --> 43:38.133
Two years we haven't seen each other
and we just flow into the old act.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.367
Please, stop molesting the customers.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.996
A daiquiri if you will, bartender.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.542
I taught this young man
everything he knows.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.794
I doubt that.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.007
Don't you waste your loyalty on him.

43:55.091 --> 43:57.676
He'll dump you after Valentine's Day.

44:01.514 --> 44:03.015
Isn't that clever?

44:03.850 --> 44:06.184
What the hell are you doing down here?

44:07.186 --> 44:10.689
This lad is the best bartender
south of 14th Street.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.024
It's his downfall.

44:12.108 --> 44:14.943
I don't see how being good
at something can be your downfall.

44:15.028 --> 44:16.028
Thank you.

44:16.112 --> 44:18.697
I grant you, it's not
an easy concept to grasp.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.782
Now you take our hero, here.

44:20.867 --> 44:23.452
I haven't seen him in a while
and I've never been here before,

44:23.536 --> 44:25.037
but I will bet my bile duct

44:25.121 --> 44:28.874
that he's got some kind
of success manual behind the bar.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.877
Come on, Flanagan.
I know it's here.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.594
- Touché.
- Voilá.

44:41.054 --> 44:42.721
You see, Flanagan's a believer.

44:42.805 --> 44:43.847
Always will be.

44:43.931 --> 44:46.224
He doesn't realize the doors are shut
to people like us.

44:46.309 --> 44:48.226
Maybe he wants to open them.

44:48.311 --> 44:50.103
Then he has to
steal the keys, sweetheart.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.981
Something Coughlin here
has been unable to do.

44:53.066 --> 44:55.442
I don't have to, not anymore.

44:55.526 --> 44:56.651
I've had my miracle.

44:57.028 --> 44:59.780
Oh, what? Some alky
remember you in his will?

45:02.075 --> 45:03.450
Better.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.202
I am in love.

45:05.912 --> 45:06.912
Oh.

45:08.206 --> 45:09.998
There is my miracle.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.126
Who? Pocahontas over there?

45:13.211 --> 45:15.128
Waiting for everyone to notice her?

45:15.213 --> 45:17.923
How dare you speak that way
about my wife.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.511
Your wife?

45:22.595 --> 45:25.222
- In your dreams.
- For real.

45:25.306 --> 45:27.349
We are here on our honeymoon.

45:27.433 --> 45:28.475
Sweetheart!

45:31.604 --> 45:32.938
Come hither!

45:41.531 --> 45:42.781
You're married?

45:43.282 --> 45:45.992
This is true love, young Flanagan.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.994
True love with a kicker.

45:48.121 --> 45:50.288
She's got millions.

45:50.373 --> 45:51.623
Where were you?

45:51.707 --> 45:53.542
I thought you'd drowned or something.

45:53.626 --> 45:54.876
No such luck.

45:54.961 --> 45:56.837
Brian Flanagan. Kerry Coughlin.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.130
The love of my life.

45:59.465 --> 46:00.882
- Hello.
- Hi.

46:00.967 --> 46:03.009
You see before you
a changed man.

46:03.094 --> 46:07.013
The love of a good woman
has made me see the light.

46:22.029 --> 46:25.157
Brian's cute.
How long have you known him?

46:25.241 --> 46:27.367
About 1 0 hours.

46:31.664 --> 46:33.290
Excuse me.

46:33.374 --> 46:35.000
There you go.

46:35.543 --> 46:38.753
I have never seen a club
with such intense dance vibes.

46:38.838 --> 46:41.381
Come on,
let's decimate this dance floor.

46:45.678 --> 46:47.012
I don't get the two of them.

46:47.680 --> 46:52.601
Simple. She's a rich chick,
whose family owns half of Manhattan.

46:52.685 --> 46:56.688
Just to piss them off,
she decided to marry a bartender.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.940
True love.

46:59.025 --> 47:00.984
Let's dance.

47:26.552 --> 47:30.138
Do you ever have the feeling
that you might meet somebody?

47:30.223 --> 47:32.974
You know when you
walk into some place.

47:34.268 --> 47:36.978
- Star-crossed lovers syndrome?
- Hmm.

47:37.063 --> 47:38.230
No.

47:38.314 --> 47:39.606
No?

47:40.858 --> 47:42.984
I had a premonition
that I was gonna meet somebody

47:43.069 --> 47:44.194
when I came down here.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.820
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

47:45.905 --> 47:48.281
You still got time, you know.

47:48.366 --> 47:51.451
Some woman must have really
done a job on you.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.954
Why does it always
have to be a woman?

47:54.038 --> 47:56.414
It doesn't. Your friend,
what's his name...

47:56.499 --> 47:58.333
Doug could've done it to you.

47:58.417 --> 48:00.085
What's this?

48:00.169 --> 48:02.504
Immune to Coughlin's fatal charms?

48:02.588 --> 48:04.965
Give him a minute. You'll love him.
All women do.

48:06.342 --> 48:08.510
I'm not like all women.

48:09.637 --> 48:11.680
I'll give you that.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.141
Of course, I'm not like all men either.

48:15.226 --> 48:17.477
Yes, you are an original,

48:17.562 --> 48:19.646
till you prove otherwise.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.277
Uh-oh! I better be careful
not to lose my unique status.

48:34.203 --> 48:36.955
So, is this one-night stand time?

48:38.040 --> 48:39.791
It doesn't make you a bad person.

48:41.335 --> 48:42.961
Your parents own half of Manhattan?

48:44.672 --> 48:46.381
No.

48:47.300 --> 48:50.969
Well, then your virtue is
quite safe with me.

48:52.013 --> 48:54.014
For this evening anyway.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.232
Come on, I'll race you. Go!

49:22.835 --> 49:24.169
Hi.

49:59.288 --> 50:00.330
Smile.

50:03.584 --> 50:04.876
So, this is your profession.

50:05.961 --> 50:08.088
More like my obsession.

50:08.714 --> 50:11.508
- Does it pay the rent?
- Someday it will.

50:12.426 --> 50:15.595
Right now, though.
I'm waiting tables at Jerry's Deli.

50:16.222 --> 50:17.806
Sure, I know the place.

50:17.890 --> 50:19.808
Home of the famous cement Danish.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.060
That's the one.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.270
- Yeah.
- Hey!

50:25.815 --> 50:27.482
Don't look. It's not done.

50:27.566 --> 50:30.026
- This doesn't look like me.
- It's the real you.

50:30.111 --> 50:32.362
You've captured my innermost soul.

50:35.783 --> 50:37.158
Are you okay?

50:38.244 --> 50:39.619
Shit.

50:39.704 --> 50:40.912
Aw!

50:46.544 --> 50:51.339
We should go on one of those.
Tomorrow?

50:54.260 --> 50:55.844
There's a guy who makes these.

50:55.928 --> 50:56.970
One guy?

50:57.430 --> 50:58.763
He must be exhausted.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.057
Yes, he is.

51:01.142 --> 51:02.577
But still he gets up in the morning,

51:02.601 --> 51:05.603
he kisses his wife and
he goes to his drink-umbrella factory,

51:05.688 --> 51:09.190
where he rips off
1 0 billion of these a year.

51:10.151 --> 51:11.276
This guy's a millionaire.

51:11.694 --> 51:13.903
How about the guy who makes these?

51:13.988 --> 51:15.071
How about that guy?

51:15.156 --> 51:17.782
Not to mention the guy
who makes these.

51:17.908 --> 51:20.535
And those little wrappers
are made by another guy.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.498
What these plastic things
at the end of the laces?

51:26.167 --> 51:29.961
It's probably got one of those
weird names too like flugelbinder...

51:30.045 --> 51:32.213
Flugelbinders, right.

51:33.674 --> 51:37.260
We sit here and
we're surrounded by millionaires.

51:38.137 --> 51:42.223
You wrack your brains day and night to
come up with a moneymaking scheme

51:42.308 --> 51:45.351
and some guy corners
the flugelbinder market.

51:45.811 --> 51:48.354
Poor baby, he's frustrated.

51:49.982 --> 51:53.318
You get a barjob to keep
your days free for your real gig.

51:54.361 --> 51:57.405
After work, you're so charged,
you have a few drinks.

51:57.490 --> 51:59.324
"Hey, it's party time."

52:00.451 --> 52:03.244
Days get shorter and shorter,
nights, longer and longer.

52:03.329 --> 52:06.581
Before you know it,
your life is just one long night

52:06.665 --> 52:09.334
with a few comatose daylight hours.

52:12.880 --> 52:15.298
"Stop feeling so sorry for yourself,
Flanagan."

52:15.382 --> 52:19.427
Hey, your flugelbinder is out there
waiting to be discovered.

52:19.845 --> 52:22.680
- Waiting.
- You think so?

52:22.973 --> 52:24.057
I do.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.597
No, stay.

53:05.266 --> 53:06.891
Stay there.

53:10.145 --> 53:11.312
Uh-oh!

53:20.990 --> 53:22.156
Ta-da!

54:14.627 --> 54:17.545
I wish we could stay here forever.

54:17.630 --> 54:20.632
Build a little hut over there
on the beach.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.550
I'd fish and pick coconuts.

54:22.635 --> 54:25.303
No, I'd do the fishing
and coconut-picking.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.804
- No.
- Yes.

54:26.889 --> 54:29.098
You would make thatch skirts
to sell to the tourists.

54:29.183 --> 54:30.558
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

54:30.643 --> 54:32.769
Thatch one, purl two?

54:33.395 --> 54:36.189
Yeah, and we'd never go home.

54:37.024 --> 54:40.693
Our kids would look really great
in dreadlocks, too.

54:41.487 --> 54:43.237
Kids?

54:57.670 --> 55:00.463
How you making out
with that little blond chippie?

55:00.547 --> 55:03.716
How come I've always got the chippies
and you're always with a princess?

55:03.801 --> 55:06.844
That's a question only you can answer.

55:06.929 --> 55:08.471
This man's phenomenal.

55:08.555 --> 55:09.931
Put him in a room full of women

55:10.015 --> 55:12.725
and he goes for the poorest
and the dumbest every time.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.354
The man's astounding.

55:16.438 --> 55:18.606
His wife parades half naked
on the beach

55:18.691 --> 55:20.733
and he thinks
she's just there for the sun.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.486
My wife does not need other men.

55:24.029 --> 55:26.906
You know what they say
about sexual vanity in men over 40?

55:26.991 --> 55:28.616
It's the first sign of senility.

55:29.076 --> 55:32.161
Please try to keep your envy in check.

55:32.246 --> 55:34.539
- Envy?
- He's my protégé.

55:34.873 --> 55:36.791
I taught him all I know.

55:36.875 --> 55:39.252
And with a token,
it might get me on a subway.

55:39.336 --> 55:41.421
You can only take a guy so far.

55:41.505 --> 55:44.132
Then it's a question of biology.
Biology is destiny.

55:44.216 --> 55:46.968
Ah! The old philosopher.

55:47.052 --> 55:49.303
There are two kinds of people
in this world.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.389
The workers and the hustlers.

55:51.473 --> 55:53.493
The hustlers never work
and the workers never hustle.

55:53.517 --> 55:56.644
And you my friend are a worker.

55:56.729 --> 55:58.790
God knows I've tried to beat
that instinct out of him,

55:58.814 --> 56:01.315
but it's ingrained in
your immigrant blood.

56:01.400 --> 56:04.736
Look how tasty your cocktails are,
look how clean you keep your bar.

56:04.820 --> 56:07.780
You actually take pride in your work.

56:10.117 --> 56:11.159
I do not.

56:12.244 --> 56:15.038
Is he or isn't he a great bartender?

56:15.122 --> 56:16.664
- The best.
- See? They love you.

56:19.501 --> 56:21.753
Listen, bozo, if you think
I'm stuck in this gig...

56:21.837 --> 56:23.504
Face it, you're a career proletarian.

56:23.589 --> 56:27.633
You've been standing in a puddle
so long you've got webbed feet.

56:27.718 --> 56:29.529
Just because he gets lucky
with a rich chick...

56:29.553 --> 56:32.555
Lucky, he says.
You couldn't do it.

56:32.639 --> 56:36.267
I've know this man for 3 years
and believe me, he's not a closer.

56:36.351 --> 56:39.771
This place is crawling
with moneyed females.

56:40.773 --> 56:42.899
Case in point.

56:42.983 --> 56:45.610
Rich and ripe and out of your league.

56:48.113 --> 56:49.864
- Out of my league?
- Mmm-hmm.

56:49.948 --> 56:52.784
She just happened to be here
checking me out the other night.

56:53.619 --> 56:56.954
Maybe she had 1 5 minutes to kill.

56:58.415 --> 57:01.709
Know what it'd take to make a score
on a smart woman like that?

57:01.794 --> 57:03.211
You'd have to get over on her,

57:03.295 --> 57:05.755
her managers, her lawyers,
her trustees, her maid

57:05.964 --> 57:07.924
and her tennis coach.

57:10.052 --> 57:12.470
I've been training for this my whole life.

57:14.598 --> 57:19.393
$50 says you don't even
make it over the bar.

57:19.478 --> 57:21.938
Tell me.

57:22.397 --> 57:24.107
That's a bet.

57:24.942 --> 57:27.610
You guys are in on this. Be cool.

57:30.989 --> 57:33.908
- Mademoiselle.
- Vodka on the rocks with a lime.

57:33.992 --> 57:35.993
No, this is the tropics.

57:36.328 --> 57:38.412
At least try a Jus d'Amour.

57:38.997 --> 57:40.540
- Pardon me?
- A Jus d'Amour.

57:40.624 --> 57:43.417
It means juice of love.

57:44.128 --> 57:47.130
It's made with fresh fruit
right off the vine.

57:47.714 --> 57:51.843
Trust me when I tell you
that it is nothing short...

57:53.720 --> 57:55.847
of spectacular.

57:58.809 --> 58:02.436
Excuse me. Do I have "fuck me"
written on my forehead?

58:05.649 --> 58:08.025
I can't see a thing without my contacts.

58:10.028 --> 58:12.363
You're just full of confidence,
aren't you?

58:14.116 --> 58:16.159
Kinda makes you curious, don't it?

58:18.328 --> 58:20.121
Mighty Casey has struck out.

58:20.205 --> 58:23.082
- Now, I don't...
- Game's not over yet.

58:23.167 --> 58:24.208
It wouldn't be any fun

58:24.293 --> 58:27.211
if they fell over with
their legs in the air, would it?

58:30.382 --> 58:31.716
Bartender?

58:35.012 --> 58:36.721
Excuse me.

58:47.399 --> 58:49.859
Good night, Paul. Thanks a lot.
It was a good night.

58:58.577 --> 59:00.369
You are bad.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:30.876
Hey, Dulcy.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.463
Where's Jordan?

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:38.342
She left on a flight back
to New York late last night.

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:40.052
What'd you do to her anyway?

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.872
Brian, are you there?

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:09.707
It's Bonnie.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.792
Brian?

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:12.918
Come in.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:18.632
Hi.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:23.554
You found my secret hiding place.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.806
The guys at the bar told me.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.684
I've been thinking about you all day.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.062
Yeah?

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:34.106
The plane ride home will cure that.

01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:36.901
What I got there ain't no cure for.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.862
You can't send me away like this.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:42.239
I don't know
what'll happen to me if you do.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.783
My business'll go to hell.

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.494
I'll start writing bad checks.

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.287
We can't have that now, can we?

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:50.122
No.

01:01:52.793 --> 01:01:54.919
You don't really want me
to go away, do you?

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.185
These drinks are going to be very tasty.

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:18.275
- Into the market now, are we?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.070
What's my greatest talent?

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.197
Reading between the lines.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.866
That's what the market's all about.

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:27.451
Cheers.

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:31.664
I must admit,

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:35.376
I never thought
I'd see you set up like this.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:39.171
Don't you worry,
I won't forget my close friends.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:41.575
Kerry's old man has just backed me

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.552
in the most luxurious joint
Manhattan's ever seen.

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.720
We open in a couple of weeks.

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:50.683
You come back to New York with us
and I'll make you head bartender.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:53.394
That sounds very nice,

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:55.354
but I've got plans of my own.

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:58.023
Like what?

01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.817
Bonnie's hooking me up
with her business.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.486
I'll be heading
back to New York with her.

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:04.947
A kept man, eh?

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:08.826
You think you made a breakthrough
cutting that blonde lose.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.786
Meanwhile your conscience is
killing you.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:14.540
If she hadn't left,
you'd be back there begging.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:16.876
You think so, eh?

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:18.419
Uh-huh.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:22.590
And bottle of Louis XIII says you'll be
working for me by St. Patrick's Day.

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:25.843
$500 bottle of brandy.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.138
I'll have to take that bet.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:49.283
Wake up! On your feet, come on!

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:52.912
Whoo! One, two, three, four!

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:55.414
Work those hips. Come on, girls!

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:58.250
Feel it burn.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.919
That's right! Burn it.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.504
Morning, babe.

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:04.215
Listen, can you get me
some carrot juice from the fridge?

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:05.925
Get some for yourself, too.

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:07.885
It's addictive.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.222
Every fucking morning.

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:16.602
Just tell him not to make a move
until he's seen our line, that's all.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.230
Send Harvey to Dallas right away.

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.150
Good, Tony.

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:25.236
Great. You are beautiful.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.740
Okay, I'll be in the office in 1 5.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.033
Ciao, Tony.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.202
Tony?

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:35.996
Tony Scaduto, the sales manager?

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:37.289
I thought he was in Mexico.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:39.208
He got back Friday.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.876
Then I can go see him.

01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:43.921
Let it wait just a smidgen longer.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.840
Remember, you're picking me up
at 7:00 tonight.

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:49.365
Why don't you wear the gray pinstripe
we bought you last week?

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:51.762
Okay.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:54.807
Did you tell him
about my marketing ideas?

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:59.103
Honey, I don't want them to think I'm
shoving my boyfriend down their throat.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:01.188
What difference does it make?
You're the boss.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:06.277
These guys are top salesmen.
I can't treat them like office boys.

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:07.778
Listen to me.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:11.031
You could wait six months,

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:14.201
you'd still be the youngest
sales manager in the business.

01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:15.327
Trust me, baby.

01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:01.290
Hey!
Get that heap out of the way!

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.959
- How am I gonna get out of here?
- Cool down, buddy.

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:05.919
You limo drivers are all alike.

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:08.422
You stand around
with your finger up your ass.

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:09.798
Give us a break.

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.508
You'll give him a heart attack.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:16.764
Art!

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.349
Hello!

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:21.727
So good to see you.
Hello, darling.

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:24.938
God, it's been ages.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:26.065
Hi.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.067
You look fabulous in that coat.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.444
That color is gorgeous on you.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.446
Darling?

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:36.200
What a drag.
She said she was totally sorry.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.745
Take my coat, will you?

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.922
I like that piece there.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:55.678
How are you?

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.481
Bonnie, let's get out of here.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.858
Darling, I think
you've had enough to drink.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.318
Brian.

01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:13.089
What, are we playing
musical high balls here?

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:14.488
Heel, boy.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:15.572
Come again?

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:17.991
Haven't gotten
this one party-broken, have you?

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.828
This is Robert Powell,
he's the sculptor.

01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:21.912
Oh!

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:25.249
How do you do?

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.334
- Interesting work.
- Thank you.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:30.713
It's very urban in orientation.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:32.464
Robert, tell me.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:36.510
How did you get the cockroach
to stand still...

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:38.470
You're drunk.

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:40.931
And you're ugly.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.060
Brian!

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.938
Could you hold this?

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:52.151
I'm okay.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:07:59.658
How could you do this?

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.577
Have a nice day!

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.046
Come on, this suspense is killing me.

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:14.923
At least you could apologize.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.841
Apologize?

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:20.470
- Yes.
- We have to talk about this seriously.

01:08:23.183 --> 01:08:26.685
Talk is overrated as a means
of resolving disputes.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.484
I moved my stuff out of your place
this afternoon.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.279
Left a can of Spam in the refrigerator.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.483
I hope your Brewer's yeast
doesn't take it personally.

01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:41.742
Bastard!

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.828
Shit!

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.331
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:51.542
I'm... Brian.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.252
Listen, baby.

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:54.982
I've got some interviews
set up for tomorrow.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.590
Forget it!

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:58.591
I am not a salesman.

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:02.805
I tried to sell out to you,
but I couldn't close the deal.

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.348
Please.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.725
I don't want to end it this way.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.729
Jesus, everything ends badly,
otherwise it wouldn't end.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:12.606
Believe me.

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:15.984
You'll wake up in the
morning with a sigh of relief

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.778
because I'm not there.

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:01.071
- Waitress.
- I'll be there in a second.

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:08.829
Excuse me, could you tell me
what the specials are please?

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:10.414
What are you doing here?

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:13.208
Bet you thought
you'd never see me again.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.127
"Hoped" is a better word.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.588
- Excuse me.
- I'll be there in a minute.

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:19.923
Miss, we have theater tickets.

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.217
You obviously are not here to eat,

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:23.742
so I'd appreciate it if you'd leave.

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:26.763
- Miss!
- I'll be there in a minute!

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:28.807
I'm not leaving.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.518
Your sexy, little smile
is not gonna work this time.

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:35.314
I'm not leaving. That's it.

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:37.065
You're not leaving?

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:40.193
Not until you let me apologize.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:44.698
Did you say you'd like
to see the specials, sir?

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:45.991
I'd like to see the specials.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.251
Look, we've been waiting...

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:58.962
Today's specials are
Meatloaf Mozzarella,

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.007
Chicken á la King.

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:07.054
May I suggest
some ketchup for your fries.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.351
Fuck.

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:19.274
Shit.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:26.573
I'd think twice about
ordering the specials if I were you.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:39.503
Spare change for my dry cleaning?

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.421
Sorry. Payday's Friday.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:43.757
You wouldn't treat a stray dog like this.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:46.301
A stray dog can be loyal.

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.804
All right, I'm a rat
and there's no hope for me.

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:51.682
But even I have a right to
defend myself,

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:54.101
or at least to explain.

01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:56.353
Taxi!

01:11:58.231 --> 01:11:59.898
Come on in.

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:20.794
Is this our waterfall?

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:22.087
No.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:25.007
It's terrific.

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:28.427
Yeah, it's all right.
Name's Mooney, not Monet.

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:35.934
So, why did you humiliate me
like that in Jamaica?

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.271
How did I humiliate you?

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:41.648
Brian, I was there.

01:12:41.733 --> 01:12:44.109
I saw you go off with that woman.

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:47.612
You're such an asshole.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.372
It's not as bad as it seems.

01:12:57.832 --> 01:13:00.208
Doug landed a rich chick,

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:04.004
and that night he bet me
that I couldn't do the same.

01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:08.258
A rich chick? You'd go with a woman
just because she had money.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.302
No, it's not the money.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:13.972
He bet me that I wasn't
good enough to hustle her.

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:16.516
Hustle her?

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.268
I was worth so little to you

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:20.520
that you could just take
some stupid juvenile bet?

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:24.232
No. A guy lays down a dare,
you gotta take it.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:29.613
Brian, how do you think I felt
seeing you go off with some woman

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.448
after the time we spent together?

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:34.201
Hold on.
You were pushing me down there.

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:36.787
You were coming on too strong, too fast.

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:38.914
Oh, I was pushing you?

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.916
You happened to be there, too.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.628
I thought we had something going.
I didn't play any games with you.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.546
I know.

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:52.260
I'm sorry...

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.806
I guess I just got spooked.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:14:00.685
But now I know I can handle it.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.687
Oh, you can handle it, huh?

01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:06.191
What if you got spooked again?

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.401
I won't.

01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:11.321
- I'll bet I can spook you.
- No way.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.825
I'm pregnant.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:18.161
I'm spooked.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.832
It's mine?

01:14:22.834 --> 01:14:27.295
- I was only asking!
- You're not going to be burdened.

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.382
You can still go out and make a million.
Don't worry.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:33.969
I'm not worried.
I mean, I am worried.

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.763
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

01:14:36.848 --> 01:14:38.348
Just go!

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:41.810
- Why?
- Because I want you to! Just go!

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:48.191
You let me come up here just so
you could kick me out. Didn't you?

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.317
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:01.873 --> 01:15:03.206
No.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.377
No, just get out!

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:09.254
I know you're upset,

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.215
but if this is the way it's gonna be,
why'd you tell me about the baby?

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:16.511
Because I knew it would be
the best way to get you out of my life.

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:42.579
Madison Square Garden,

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:44.664
Syracuse trying to stay
within striking distance...

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:50.045
That's for cigarette change!

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:52.005
When you hand it to me, it's for change.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:55.675
When you put it on the edge of the bar,
it's a tip.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:58.970
- Hey, kid!
- Hi, Uncle Pat, Ed. How are you?

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:02.432
I got a problem.
Got time for a quick talk?

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:05.060
Make it fast. I'm real busy here.

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:11.274
What's the matter?

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.447
I'm going to be a father.

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:21.660
- That's it, bar's closed. Finish up.
- Come on!

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.411
Come on, hit the road.
Let's go.

01:16:23.496 --> 01:16:26.289
- Eddie, finish up. Everybody out.
- What?

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:31.795
You ought to know better than to come
to a bartender for advice.

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:34.464
What am I going to do about this girl?

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:35.882
Nothing.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:37.676
What do you mean, nothing?

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:40.220
She's not trying to shake you down,

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:42.764
not making you marry her,
you don't care about her.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.368
You can walk away
from the whole thing.

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:49.646
What if I do care about her?

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:51.523
Then you got a problem.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:58.989
Jordan, I just want to talk to you.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:03.576
She's not hiding.
She's not home.

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:06.162
She's at her parents' place.
Go bang down their door.

01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:08.577
You wouldn't happen to know
where that is, would you?

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:11.126
Sure, Park Avenue. Corner of 67th.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:16.047
- Park Avenue?
- Yeah.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.597
You get here
when you say you will,

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:26.516
or you won't work in this building again.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.143
Excuse me.

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:29.769
So you'll be here what time?

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:31.604
I don't mean to bother you...

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:33.606
What time did you say you'd be here?

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.275
Hello?

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:37.402
Sorry, what apartment
are the Mooneys in?

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.654
It's a penthouse.
Your name, please?

01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:42.282
- Brian Flanagan.
- Are the Mooneys expecting you?

01:17:42.366 --> 01:17:43.700
No, not exactly.

01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:47.037
All visitors have to be announced,
Mr. Flanagan.

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.885
Mr. Flanagan,
would you come in, please?

01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:04.554
- May I take your coat, sir?
- Okay.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.226
There'll be someone with you
in a moment.

01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:11.561
Thank you.

01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:31.331
I'm Richard Mooney.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:35.418
- I'm Jordan's father.
- I'm Brian Flanagan.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.671
- I've come to see her.
- She's not here.

01:18:38.756 --> 01:18:40.757
But come in.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.634
I'd like to talk to you.

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:48.098
Sit down.

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:56.648
I've certainly heard a lot about you
in the last couple of days.

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:02.695
I don't know what really happened
between the two of you, but...

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:06.866
I must say, you've got a lot of nerve

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:09.077
coming up here after
what you did to Jordan.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.204
I understand that,

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:13.998
and I realize that Jordan is very upset.

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:16.645
But if I could talk to her, make her see

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:19.087
that I'm gonna
stick by her through this...

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.714
I hope you're not suggesting
that you'll marry her.

01:19:25.928 --> 01:19:29.514
I'm not sure what we're gonna do.
We have a lot to talk about...

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:32.809
The hell you do!

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:37.105
Look, I know Jordan a lot better
than you do,

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:39.858
and I've never seen her
as unhappy as she is at this moment.

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:43.486
She is just not very wise
in the ways of the world.

01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:47.240
Right now, what she needs around
are people she can trust.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:50.452
- She can trust me.
- She doesn't want to see you.

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.329
She doesn't even want to talk to you.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:57.792
Just wait here one moment,
will you please?

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:09.679
- Good afternoon, Miss Mooney.
- Hi.

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:18.771
- Mr. Mooney, I think I'm just gonna...
- Flanagan, here.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.774
- What the hell's this?
- That's for you.

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:28.615
$1 0,000.

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:34.120
- Is that all your daughter's worth?
- How much will it take?

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:36.206
I don't want your goddamn money.

01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:39.667
You can't buy me out of Jordan's life!

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:42.754
You think I'd let some bartender
destroy my daughter's life?

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.465
- That is her choice!
- The hell you say!

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.509
What is going on here?

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:50.011
Jordan, I came here to talk to you.

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:53.806
- If you don't get out of here...
- Dad, I'll handle this!

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:57.810
I know the other night
I didn't say the right things.

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:00.063
God knows I have not done
the right things.

01:21:01.065 --> 01:21:03.733
But I think there's a chance for us.

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:06.152
Brian, there is no "us."

01:21:06.237 --> 01:21:08.821
There are too many things
about "us" that don't work.

01:21:08.906 --> 01:21:10.740
What about the baby?

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:13.368
A kid, I mean, our kid needs a father.

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:17.038
Not one that won't be around in a year.

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:19.874
With your lifestyle,
what kind of father would you be?

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:24.504
Jordan, I want a second chance.

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:27.298
No.

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:30.510
- I deserve a second chance.
- No.

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:35.014
How will I ever know
that you're being honest with me?

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.141
You can barely be honest with yourself.

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:38.768
Honest?

01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:40.770
Were you so honest?

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:43.356
Why didn't you tell me
you were the original rich chick?

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.733
Because you're so hung up on money,

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:49.779
I was afraid I'd never know
how you felt about me.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:53.116
Me! How you'd really feel about me.

01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:57.829
See this?

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:03.126
This is your father's idea
of how to get me out of your life.

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:11.134
This is how hung up on money I am.

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:14.470
As for the way I feel about you,

01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:19.225
I guess you'll never know.

01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:30.778
Let me in!

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:32.363
Hey, what about us?

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:34.115
We've been here for two hours!

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:36.701
Let us in, Henry. It's cold out here.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:37.910
Henry? Remember me?

01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:39.912
I'm Bruce Springsteen's cousin.

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:41.914
- You look more like his couch.
- Henry!

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:44.042
I'm Doug's friend.

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:47.045
Mr. Coughlin doesn't have any friends
on a Saturday night.

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:49.505
- Good evening, Henry.
- Hey!

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:58.681
- Where's Doug Coughlin?
- Over there.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.351
Hey, you!

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:02.852
Doug!

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.480
- Coughlin! Doug!
- Flanagan!

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:08.941
My best friend in the world!
My only friend!

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.860
Piss off, Henry. It's okay.

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:14.280
It's great to see you, my only friend.
Sit down.

01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:17.033
It looks like you've got
a lot of friends here this evening.

01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:18.868
- Proctologist's dream.
- What?

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:20.953
Wall-to-wall assholes.

01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:24.832
- Great to see you, Flanagan.
- I've come to pay off my bet.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.251
- Brian!
- Kerry!

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.089
What are you doing here?

01:23:31.799 --> 01:23:34.092
I've come
to beg and plead for a job.

01:23:34.385 --> 01:23:37.512
It'd be great to get some talent
behind the bar.

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:53.569
Let's go somewhere where
we can appreciate this.

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:55.113
Come on.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.164
Get in there.

01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.333
Get in there and spend some money.

01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:09.585
Keep me in the manner
I'm accustomed to.

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:12.755
Get in there and spend some money,
you two.

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:15.258
What do you think of my rowboat?

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:18.761
Jesus Christ!

01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:20.346
Come aboard, ye landlubber!

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.728
Baccarat crystal.

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:29.939
Louis XIII. Voilá.

01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:33.067
Should we let it breathe?

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:36.779
It hasn't breathed in 50 years.
It's dead.

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:38.573
Let's just drink it.

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:54.505
- Health and friendship?
- Life and love.

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:08.895
Douglas Coughlin,
your ship has certainly come in!

01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:13.816
My ship.

01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:19.238
My ship is going down,
and I'm going down with it.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:21.657
- How's that?
- All this is an illusion.

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:25.787
I'm on my ass.
I haven't got a pot to piss in.

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:27.205
Mmm.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.333
$1 00,000 a week. Painful.

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:35.213
I should've read some of
your sacred books, young Flanagan.

01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:40.927
The only thing I know about saloons is
how to pour whiskey and run my mouth.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:44.555
I knew nothing about insurance,

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:51.813
or sales tax, or the building code,
or labor costs,

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:55.441
or the power company,
or purchasing, or linens.

01:25:55.526 --> 01:25:58.027
Everyone with a hand
stuck it in my pocket.

01:25:58.111 --> 01:26:00.029
You must make enough to cover that.

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:04.534
If I'd stuck to what I know best,
which is almost nothing.

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:09.789
Instead I put all the cash
into commodities.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:13.042
And blew the fucking lot.

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:18.840
On the margin.
Buy, cover, buy, cover.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.385
I wanted it fast.

01:26:25.556 --> 01:26:27.682
See the headlines.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:32.645
"Douglas Coughlin:
From bartender to billionaire."

01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:40.403
Hey, take it easy.

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:41.571
Relax.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:46.325
The luck is gone, the brain is shot.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.995
But the liquor, we still got.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.542
Doug?

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.087
Are you down there?

01:26:58.171 --> 01:27:03.092
She knows nothing about this.
She thinks I'm a fucking hero.

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:13.686
My princess. My dream.

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:16.606
Baby, not again.

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.149
I want to go home.

01:27:18.859 --> 01:27:20.026
Come here.

01:27:21.612 --> 01:27:22.820
Toast, Flanagan.

01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:27.533
To the first and last person
I ever cared about.

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.287
My wife.

01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:32.580
Doug?

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.125
Doug, wake up.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:38.461
I want to go home.

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:03.945
You know you're the only person
in the world Doug respects?

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:08.491
We were a good team once.

01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:12.370
Walk me to my apartment.

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.830
I hate going to that place alone.

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:21.337
- I better check on Doug.
- Please?

01:28:22.673 --> 01:28:24.757
I want to talk about Doug.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:26.592
About his problems.

01:29:04.297 --> 01:29:07.633
Doug says
you're incredible with women.

01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:10.052
A real lady-killer.

01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:11.971
Is that what he says?

01:29:13.223 --> 01:29:15.182
What's your secret weapon?

01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:20.229
What you see is what you get.

01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:41.500
- Hold it.
- What'd you do that for?

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:49.967
I can't make it
with my best friend's old lady.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.138
Am I supposed to
live with the same man,

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:56.557
day in and day out, forever,

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.559
and have no one else in my life?

01:29:58.643 --> 01:30:01.145
Yes. It's called marriage.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.272
You wanted this as much as I did.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:05.066
That's why you're up here.

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:06.692
But you can't do it now, can you?

01:30:07.694 --> 01:30:08.819
You're scared.

01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:13.532
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

01:30:13.909 --> 01:30:15.534
You're just scared!

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:41.393
Hey, Doug!

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:57.034
Help me!
Somebody help me!

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:01.831
Somebody help me!

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:16.971
Is there anything
you can tell me about what happened?

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:55.926
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want..."

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:39.303
My dearest Brian,

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.680
a guy like me looks in the mirror.

01:32:41.765 --> 01:32:44.725
He either grins
or he starts to fade away,

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:48.604
and l haven't seen anything
to grin about in a long time.

01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:56.028
This may not be the most graceful exit,
but l know when the bottle's empty,

01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:59.031
that the only thing
l'm really gonna miss

01:32:59.115 --> 01:33:01.533
is the conversations we had going.

01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:07.122
At least l get the last word,
even if I had to mail it in.

01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:13.295
Coughlin's Law: Bury the dead,
they stink up the joint.

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.548
The rest of Coughlin's Laws, ignore.

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:19.301
The guy was always full of shit.

01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:25.557
But l guess you knew that already.

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:52.960
- Mooney's apartment, Brian...
- I know who you are.

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:55.254
I've been instructed
not to let you in here.

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:57.172
- If you'll just call...
- Leave now!

01:33:58.008 --> 01:34:00.759
I just want to
talk to her for a few minutes,

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:02.261
I don't want to cause any trouble.

01:34:02.345 --> 01:34:05.431
- Send her a letter. Out!
- Get your hands off me, man.

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:06.890
Out!

01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:11.854
Hey!

01:34:23.033 --> 01:34:25.826
- Where's Jordan?
- She's in there.

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:27.411
But you can't go in there!

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:28.579
Open the door!

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:30.372
Jordan?

01:34:30.957 --> 01:34:32.333
Jordan!

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.097
- I have to talk to you.
- What's going on?

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:37.588
Please, there's so many things,
I don't know where to begin.

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:38.714
Doug is dead.

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:40.632
What?

01:34:40.717 --> 01:34:43.635
- He killed himself.
- Brian!

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:46.555
He was my best friend,
but he was too proud to let me help him.

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:49.683
He was too proud to show
how he felt until it was too late.

01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:51.518
I don't want to make that same mistake.

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:55.522
Into the sitting room...

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:58.233
I thought I told you to keep
that punk out of this house!

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:00.361
- He got by me.
- Jordan, are you in there?

01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:04.323
I have saved money. I've worked out
a loan with my uncle for some more.

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:07.868
With hard work, I know I can turn it
into something great.

01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:11.789
Brian, I know you can,
but it doesn't really matter.

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:12.915
Listen to me!

01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:15.209
Get me the key!

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:17.294
I love you! I want to marry you.

01:35:17.837 --> 01:35:20.255
I've loved you from the first moment
I saw you, Jordan.

01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:23.384
Please, come with me.

01:35:24.427 --> 01:35:27.179
Flanagan, get the hell out of my house!

01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:29.723
Jordan, wake up! Don't you see
why he's come back here?

01:35:29.808 --> 01:35:32.893
- One reason: for the money.
- I don't want a thing from you!

01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:35.687
You're not going to get one penny.
He's a loser!

01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:37.981
I'm not a loser.
Please, Jordan, come with me.

01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:40.859
- Get him out of here.
- Stay out of this.

01:35:40.944 --> 01:35:43.362
- Please.
- Throw this bum out of here!

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:45.072
Hold it!

01:35:45.532 --> 01:35:46.949
Jordan, don't go!

01:35:47.033 --> 01:35:49.952
If you walk out of this house,
don't bother coming back.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.122
- I love him, and I'm going!
- You're not going anywhere!

01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:55.290
Jordan! Stop her!

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:57.311
- Get off of me!
- Don't fucking handle her,

01:35:57.335 --> 01:35:58.710
she's pregnant!

01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:02.047
You asshole!

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:20.023
It didn't have to be this way, you know.

01:36:31.369 --> 01:36:32.619
You're on your own.

01:36:33.163 --> 01:36:35.622
It's the only way I want it.

01:36:42.255 --> 01:36:45.549
A toast!
To the bride, and to my nephew!

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:48.427
- All the happiness!
- Salute!

01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:51.763
There you go!

01:36:51.848 --> 01:36:54.099
I've been lied to

01:36:54.184 --> 01:36:58.020
When will I be loved?

01:36:58.104 --> 01:36:59.271
Right now, baby!

01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:00.939
Oh, yeah!

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:09.781
I've been turned down
l've been pushed 'round

01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:15.704
When will I be loved?

01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:22.711
You realize we're both
completely insane.

01:37:22.795 --> 01:37:24.213
Yes.

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:27.341
You'll probably want to divorce me
in three weeks.

01:37:27.425 --> 01:37:30.385
Probably. No, you'll want to divorce me.

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:33.889
- I'll be all fat and ugly.
- Just as long as you don't get too fat.

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:38.852
I am going to be very fat,
and you are going to love it!

01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:52.991
Brian, give us a poem.

01:37:53.076 --> 01:37:54.952
Yeah! Poem!

01:37:55.036 --> 01:37:56.745
- Poem?
- Do one, Bri!

01:37:56.829 --> 01:37:58.956
- Poem?
- Poem! Yeah!

01:38:01.167 --> 01:38:03.001
- Poem?
- Poem!

01:38:03.086 --> 01:38:04.670
We want a poem!

01:38:04.754 --> 01:38:06.213
All right. Poem!

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:09.258
- Poem!
- All right, Brian!

01:38:17.016 --> 01:38:19.226
Okay, a poem.

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.021
This poem is entitled

01:38:24.399 --> 01:38:27.150
Flanagan's Advice to
His Unborn Child.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:29.570
Aw!

01:38:32.115 --> 01:38:36.243
If Jordan gives birth to a fine Irish son

01:38:36.327 --> 01:38:39.371
There'll be Cocktails & Dreams
for him one day to run

01:38:40.582 --> 01:38:43.750
A business which shall yield
a financial windfall

01:38:43.835 --> 01:38:45.669
It better!

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:46.920
Yes.

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:50.591
To be franchised in every
suburban shopping mall

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:53.302
A dynasty! You're founding a dynasty!

01:38:54.178 --> 01:38:55.679
Now...

01:38:56.973 --> 01:39:00.642
If a daughter arrives to bless our clan

01:39:00.727 --> 01:39:01.893
Aw!

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:04.563
I guess the shit
will certainly hit the fan

01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:10.944
But this I shall promise to thee

01:39:11.029 --> 01:39:13.739
I'll never let her marry a guy like me

01:39:14.866 --> 01:39:21.496
Still, if our child is the naughtiest
of girls or the wildest of men

01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:24.583
I swear, I'll be the best dad I can

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:28.670
And never ever get spooked again

01:39:33.343 --> 01:39:35.260
I bet I can still spook you.

01:39:35.345 --> 01:39:36.845
No way.

01:39:43.269 --> 01:39:48.106
Twins?

01:39:48.358 --> 01:39:49.358
Twins!

01:39:49.442 --> 01:39:51.693
- Yeah!
- All right!

01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:54.613
- Drinks are on the house!
- No!

01:39:54.697 --> 01:39:56.990
Bar is open!
