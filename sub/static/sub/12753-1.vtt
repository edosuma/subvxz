01:56.534 --> 01:59.704
Ah, Satan, <i>Mon Cher.</i>

02:02.373 --> 02:06.710
You are late, yes, you are.
Still looking for your girlfriend, huh?

02:06.919 --> 02:11.674
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Dandelo has found another.
You will never see her again.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.218
But don't you worry. There will
be others.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.614
Eh, <i>madame?</i>

03:28.792 --> 03:33.130
Yes?
Yes, who is this?

03:33.214 --> 03:35.591
This is François Delambre speaking.

03:35.674 --> 03:40.137
Helene? How are you, Helene, dear?
What can I do for you?

03:40.679 --> 03:45.309
François, I've killed Andre.

03:45.392 --> 03:49.188
- I need your help.
- Now, look, Helene, it's past midnight.

03:49.271 --> 03:53.484
I've had a hard day. I love you both
dearly, but this sort of a joke...

03:53.567 --> 03:55.861
It's true.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.239
I've killed Andre.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.284
You killed... But...

04:02.368 --> 04:04.328
Please help me.

04:04.411 --> 04:08.832
Call the police and... Come quickly.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.670
I just can't...

04:13.212 --> 04:14.672
Helene.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.757
Helene?

04:25.516 --> 04:28.435
- Yes?
- Monsieur François? Gaston.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.897
I tried to call you.
Something terrible has happened.

04:31.981 --> 04:35.234
A man is dead.
His head is under the press.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.863
And I saw a woman running...
Running away.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.824
Yes, Gaston.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.910
It looked...
I think it was Madame Delambre.

04:45.244 --> 04:48.831
You stay there, Gaston.
I'll get the police immediately.

05:04.805 --> 05:09.810
Anthenium Club?
Is Inspector Charas still there?

05:09.893 --> 05:12.187
Yes, thank you.
Yes, I'll wait.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.069
Check.

05:20.738 --> 05:23.324
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
There's a call.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.326
Thank you.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.123
- Hello?
- Inspector?

05:31.206 --> 05:35.419
This is François Delambre. You may
remember, we met a few times at the club.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.005
It's just... I'm sorry
to call you so late,

05:38.088 --> 05:40.924
but, well, I'm
in terrible trouble.

05:41.425 --> 05:45.846
- Trouble, <i>monsieur?</i>
- My sister-in-law just phoned.

05:45.929 --> 05:50.768
She'd killed her husband,
my brother... My brother, Andre.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.229
What? At our factory,
Delambre Freres.

05:56.648 --> 06:00.527
Our night watchman called too.
There is a body.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.863
Where are you now,
Mr. Delambre?

06:04.281 --> 06:08.369
I'll pick you up in a few minutes.
Good-bye. You'll have to excuse me.

06:23.801 --> 06:26.401
- Inspector, Helene lives just...
- No, we ought to look here first.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.639
- But I've got to talk to her.
- Please, I've already sent a man.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.641
She'll be all right.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.984
It's Andre.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.863
- How can we raise the press?
- I'll do it for you.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.699
Would you like us to get
one of your men?

06:47.783 --> 06:49.701
I'll be all right.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.085
Whenever you're ready, monsieur.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.271
Dead about 30 minutes.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.775
- Is the downstroke fast?
- No.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.069
About the same.

07:24.153 --> 07:27.364
- No danger of it coming down again?
- No.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.617
It's been set for 50 tons.

07:30.701 --> 07:35.205
- Impact zero.
- Zero?

07:35.372 --> 07:38.750
Yes. That means
level with the bed.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.962
- It's never been set that way. Never.
- Oh?

07:42.045 --> 07:46.467
That would squeeze
the metal to nothing.

07:47.342 --> 07:51.180
It's been set for
single strokes too.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.891
She didn't know how
to operate the press.

07:55.225 --> 07:59.188
- Are you sure this is your brother?
- Well, he...

07:59.396 --> 08:01.982
There was a long scar
on his left leg. War wound.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.902
- I'll... Would you mind?
- Doctor.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.138
I can't believe it.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.599
Can you think of any reason
why she would do such a thing?

08:35.682 --> 08:39.352
None. Absolutely none.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.855
They were completely
happy together.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.901
They have a wonderful little boy,
Philippe, whom they both adore.

08:45.984 --> 08:50.280
Helene was always so gentle.
It just doesn't make sense.

08:50.364 --> 08:53.867
Andre loved two things,
his family and his work.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.911
It's impossible.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.250
<i>- What is it, monsieur?
- The stroke count.</i>

09:01.333 --> 09:05.212
- That's the stroke count.
- I don't understand.

09:05.295 --> 09:09.383
Whoever did this to Andre...
It reads two.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.135
- They did it twice!
- Twice?

09:12.219 --> 09:17.140
Oui, monsieur.
I heard the press come down two times.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.788
- Good evening, monsieur.
- Good evening.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.067
- Is it true?
- Doctor.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.152
Yes.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.947
- Did Helene...
- Listen, I can't believe it.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.658
Inspector, this is our
family physician, Dr. Ejoute.

09:34.783 --> 09:38.203
- Inspector Charas.
- Your man called me, so I came.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.581
- How is she?
- Quite calm now.

09:40.664 --> 09:45.919
Almost in a state of euphoria,
of relief, as though she's happy about it.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.713
Is she insane, Doctor?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.382
Helene Delambre could've
never killed her husband.

09:50.465 --> 09:55.137
It's impossible.
Unless she is or was insane.

09:55.220 --> 09:59.516
- Did she tell you anything?
- Nothing, except she killed him.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.812
And how... No, there's nothing in her
that could make her do that.

10:03.895 --> 10:07.316
Why, Inspector,
I've known her all her life.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.068
I even delivered her.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.321
She and Andre were
devoted to each other.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.949
- Where is Madame Delambre?
- In the living room.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.335
François, I'm sorry I called you.

10:26.418 --> 10:30.047
As you see, I could've called
the police myself. I'm all right now.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.091
Helene, my dear, you know
if there's anything I can do...

10:33.175 --> 10:34.885
You're the police?

10:36.219 --> 10:38.722
Inspector Charas, madame.

10:38.805 --> 10:43.226
Helene, what's going on?
Why do you say you killed Andre? Why?

10:43.352 --> 10:47.105
It's all right, François.
Everything's all right now.

10:47.189 --> 10:50.025
Madame, would you
tell us what happened?

10:50.108 --> 10:53.320
Of course, <i>monsieur.</i>

10:53.403 --> 10:55.322
I killed my husband,
Andre Delambre,

10:55.405 --> 10:58.033
about half an hour ago
in the hydraulic press shed.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.160
You understand the gravity
of the crime.

11:00.243 --> 11:03.747
You say you killed your husband.
That means you murdered him.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.042
I killed Andre, yes.

11:08.168 --> 11:12.005
- Why?
- I cannot answer that question.

11:12.089 --> 11:15.175
- How did you kill him?
- With the hydraulic press.

11:15.258 --> 11:20.847
- How do you operate it?
- First you put on the main switch.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.475
Then you set the stroke
to whatever tonnage you want.

11:23.558 --> 11:27.270
You set the stroke to maximum,
that is, level with the table, or zero.

11:27.813 --> 11:31.108
Then you press the release button.
It's the red one.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.111
You mean you put your husband
under the press?

11:34.528 --> 11:36.947
No, Inspector.
He did that himself.

11:37.781 --> 11:41.118
He put his head and his arm
under the press?

11:43.245 --> 11:45.956
- Yes.
- Why?

11:46.581 --> 11:50.460
I cannot answer that question.
Coffee, Inspector?

11:51.461 --> 11:55.548
Yes, ple... Gentlemen, would you wait
for me outside, please?

11:55.632 --> 11:57.592
Yes, of course.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.228
No, thank you.

12:08.311 --> 12:12.149
Now, madame, you were happy
with your husband?

12:12.232 --> 12:16.236
There were no mistresses.
I had no lovers.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.488
We were both very happy.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.782
- That is the truth.
- Then why did you kill him?

12:20.866 --> 12:25.620
I wish to help you all I can, Inspector,
but I cannot answer that question.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.186
You pressed the button and it was all over.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.979
Yes.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.941
- Why did you press it twice?
- Oh, it was only once.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.361
The stroke count read two.
A machine cannot lie.

13:42.197 --> 13:46.159
Oh, yes. Yes, it was twice.
I... I was wrong.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.079
- I did it twice.
- Why?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.377
Perhaps you will wait, madame?

13:55.460 --> 13:57.420
Of course, Inspector.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.683
What would you advise,
medically, Doctor?

14:09.766 --> 14:14.104
Rest. Maybe in a day or two,
her state of mind will improve.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.357
Very well. You understand the lady
is under surveillance.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.026
I'll arrange for one of our nurses
to take charge of her.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.320
Of course. Thank you
very much, Inspector.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.489
You can rely on me.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.954
Well, what do you think?

14:31.037 --> 14:33.790
Would you show me
your brother's laboratory?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.959
Yes, of course.
This way.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.733
This is the work
of a madman!

14:59.816 --> 15:04.070
There was over $200,000 worth
of special equipment here.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.990
Andre was always
so careful of everything.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.075
Special equipment?
What was all this for?

15:09.159 --> 15:13.246
I don't know. It could have been
anything, any one of a dozen ideas.

15:13.330 --> 15:18.209
He... Well... When he'd develop something,
he would show it to me.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.129
He was working on an idea
for the Air Ministry.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.173
Perhaps they'd know.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.558
I imagine electronics is
a profitable field these days.

15:33.642 --> 15:36.937
Yes, very. We own
the business jointly.

15:37.062 --> 15:41.066
We both have more money
than we know what to do with.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.944
They had no outside interests.
None, I'm sure of it.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.946
That's why it
doesn't make sense.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.532
You're very attached to
both of them, aren't you?

15:49.616 --> 15:53.203
Yes. Inspector,
what does all this mean?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.288
I have no idea.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.291
She would tell me nothing
except that she'd killed him.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.962
There appears to be no motive,
no reason except insanity.

16:02.045 --> 16:05.882
And even that leaves several
important questions unanswered.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.968
Perhaps he
committed suicide.

16:08.051 --> 16:11.096
Well, if he did, why does
she say she killed him?

16:11.179 --> 16:13.765
And if it was suicide,
why such a clumsy method?

16:13.848 --> 16:15.642
And why involve your wife?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.019
And she was there.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.230
She could hang for this.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.442
Poor Philippe.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.904
What will I tell him?
How does one tell a child?

16:27.988 --> 16:32.993
If I may suggest, you could
look after the boy for a while.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.828
What's gonna happen to her?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.830
We'll keep her under
observation for the moment.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.873
There's plenty of time.

16:40.208 --> 16:43.420
Did your brother
ever experiment with animals?

16:43.586 --> 16:45.380
Never.

16:45.463 --> 16:49.134
- Or insects?
- Insects? No.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.344
That would be funny if...

16:51.428 --> 16:54.681
No, Helene and Andre believed
in the sacredness of life.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.058
They wouldn't
harm anything,

16:57.142 --> 16:59.102
not even a fly.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.400
Lunch, <i>madame.</i>

17:06.776 --> 17:08.528
Oh, I'm eating
much too much.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.448
At this rate,
I'll gain pounds.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.367
- Can I get up today?
- Ask Dr. Ejoute, madame.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.661
Every time I ask him,
he says "Tomorrow."

17:16.744 --> 17:20.040
You're coming along nicely.
The rest will do you good.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.208
Is Inspector Charas
coming today?

17:22.291 --> 17:25.211
He did not say, <i>madame.</i>

17:25.295 --> 17:28.673
I like him.
He's been very gentle.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.595
I hope François brings
that nice little boy today.

17:33.678 --> 17:36.347
What is his name?
Philippe?

17:39.225 --> 17:41.144
Yes, Philippe.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.814
A nice boy.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.651
They think I'm mad,
don't they?

17:50.528 --> 17:53.323
They never tell me
what they think about.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.757
Go away.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.801
Go away!

18:23.478 --> 18:28.566
- Is it bothering you?
- No. No, it doesn't bother me.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.945
- I'll soon rid you of the pest.
- It's all right, Nurse Andersone.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.447
Please leave it alone!
But, nurse!

18:37.742 --> 18:40.328
Stop it, nurse.
Stop it!

18:40.411 --> 18:42.539
Leave it alone!
Leave it alone!

18:43.206 --> 18:46.668
- No! No!
- What is the matter?

18:46.751 --> 18:48.712
- Let me look at that fly!
- You get back into bed!

18:48.753 --> 18:50.797
- Please let me look at the fly!
- Back into bed.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.675
Get out of my way!
Where is it? Where?

18:53.842 --> 18:56.845
Oh. Oh, there.

19:02.308 --> 19:06.020
Come on.
Come on, <i>madame.</i>

19:06.104 --> 19:09.566
Come on.
Come on, <i>madame.</i>

19:36.509 --> 19:39.262
- It's just a common housefly.
- Yes.

19:40.388 --> 19:43.224
Perhaps it's symbolic
of something deep in her subconscious,

19:43.308 --> 19:46.436
as her psychiatrist believes.

19:46.603 --> 19:49.939
Mr. Delambre,
do you think she's mad?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.941
It's obvious, isn't it?

19:52.025 --> 19:54.027
In spite of what
the doctors think,

19:54.110 --> 19:57.864
I believe Mrs. Delambre's mind
is quite clear.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.825
- Even when catching flies.
- How can you say that?

20:00.909 --> 20:03.411
She must be mad.
What about Philippe?

20:03.494 --> 20:06.331
She acts as if the boy
were mine and not hers.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.708
She may be trying
to protect him.

20:08.791 --> 20:13.463
- Perhaps she fears him or even hates him.
- That's impossible.

20:14.631 --> 20:18.676
Helene couldn't hate anyone.
You must be out of your mind.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.767
You're in love with her,
aren't you?

20:27.101 --> 20:29.229
- Yes.
- Then why didn't you marry her?

20:29.312 --> 20:31.689
Because she loved my brother.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.192
I don't think
she ever noticed me.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.152
I'm glad you're
being honest with me.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.529
You see, at first
I suspected you.

20:38.613 --> 20:41.866
Me? Why should I
do such a thing?

20:41.950 --> 20:45.870
Motive one, for his wife. Motive two,
to gain control of Delambre Electronics.

20:45.954 --> 20:49.249
What do I care about motives?
Helene is in trouble and Andre's dead.

20:49.332 --> 20:52.585
It's... It's like a nightmare.

20:52.669 --> 20:56.756
I know now you had nothing to do with it,
but I had to check for her sake.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.300
I'm sorry, Inspector.
I'm a fool.

20:59.384 --> 21:01.052
You've been so patient. Forgive me.
It's just...

21:01.135 --> 21:02.971
I understand, monsieur.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.766
It is I who should apologize. I have to
pry into all sorts of personal things.

21:06.849 --> 21:09.727
It's necessary, unfortunately.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.604
Thank you for coming.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.315
If there's anything
I can do to help, I will.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.901
Did you discover what
your brother was working on?

21:17.026 --> 21:20.488
No. The Air Ministry scientists have been
through all of his papers. Everything.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.699
They didn't mean
a thing to them.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.244
We couldn't decipher the ashes.
Nothing there either.

21:26.327 --> 21:30.498
Well, I've delayed all I can.
We've been quite patient with the lady.

21:30.581 --> 21:33.167
I'm afraid I shall have to ask
for a warrant tomorrow.

21:33.251 --> 21:36.963
- The courts can decide.
- Tomorrow?

21:37.046 --> 21:40.174
The charge
can only be murder.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.468
I'm sorry for
you and the boy,

21:42.635 --> 21:46.514
but I cannot conceive of
any verdict except guilty,

21:46.597 --> 21:48.891
or guilty but insane.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.325
- Thank you, Yvette.
- Uncle?

22:05.408 --> 22:08.536
- Yes, Philippe?
- When's Daddy coming home?

22:08.619 --> 22:12.165
- Soon.
- Can I see Mommy again tomorrow?

22:12.540 --> 22:16.711
- Yes.
- She's very sick, isn't she?

22:16.794 --> 22:18.463
Yes, Philippe, she's very sick.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.092
Do flies live a long time?

22:24.802 --> 22:26.346
I don't know. Why?

22:26.429 --> 22:29.474
Because I saw that fly
Mommy was looking for again.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.477
I didn't know your mother
was looking for one.

22:32.560 --> 22:36.731
Oh, yes, she was.
It's grown quite a lot,

22:36.814 --> 22:38.358
but I recognized it, all right.

22:41.569 --> 22:45.656
- Mmm, this is good.
- How did you recognize it?

22:46.741 --> 22:48.993
Its head is white
instead of black,

22:49.077 --> 22:51.788
and it has
a funny sort of leg.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.875
It was on your desk
this morning.

22:55.958 --> 22:59.128
Oh? I didn't notice it.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.215
When did you first
see that fly?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.468
The day Daddy went away.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.846
I had caught it,
but Mommy made me let it go.

23:08.930 --> 23:11.474
Then later she wanted me
to find it again.

23:11.933 --> 23:15.770
She changed her mind.
You know how women are.

23:17.522 --> 23:18.898
Excuse me, Philippe.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.317
I won't be a moment.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.359
<i>Inspector Charas.</i>

24:05.027 --> 24:07.113
<i>Inspector Charas.</i>

24:18.875 --> 24:22.044
- Good evening, Nurse.
- Why, Mr. Delambre.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.882
Inspector Charas told me
about her relapse. How is she now?

24:25.965 --> 24:28.676
Resting quietly, poor lady.
But monsieur...

24:28.759 --> 24:32.722
The inspector told me that I might speak
to her for a few moments alone.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.683
- He knows I'm here.
- But he didn't say you were coming.

24:35.766 --> 24:39.145
He has so much on his mind.
I won't be long.

25:06.964 --> 25:07.965
Oh.

25:08.382 --> 25:11.677
François, I didn't hear you.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.012
You look tired.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.723
Of course.
Just the office, you know.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.725
You shouldn't work so hard.

25:17.808 --> 25:21.687
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I feel all right.

25:21.771 --> 25:25.983
I'm glad you came.
I wanted to ask you something.

25:26.067 --> 25:29.362
Of course, Helene.
Anything at all.

25:36.911 --> 25:39.205
How long do flies live?

25:40.456 --> 25:42.375
Oh, I don't know.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.753
I think a month,
two months.

25:45.836 --> 25:48.798
The fly you were looking for
was in my study today.

25:51.634 --> 25:55.638
- Did... Did you kill it?
- No.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.557
You have it with you?
Give it to me.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.976
- Please, give it to me!
- I haven't got it here.

26:00.977 --> 26:01.978
Oh.

26:04.480 --> 26:08.442
- You know now.
- What is this all about?

26:09.277 --> 26:11.153
You haven't got it,
or you wouldn't ask.

26:11.529 --> 26:15.908
Yes, I have it. It's locked in my desk.
Tell me what happened.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.160
No, never.
Andre wouldn't want me to.

26:18.244 --> 26:22.456
I know you're not mad.
I want the truth.

26:22.540 --> 26:26.377
Either you tell me,
or I'm going to give it to Charas.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.297
You swear you have it?

26:31.007 --> 26:32.091
Yes.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.970
If I tell you, will you
promise to destroy it?

26:36.053 --> 26:39.265
- I can't do that until I know...
- Then I can't tell you anything.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.101
For your own sake
you've got to tell me.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.145
You're all right,

26:44.312 --> 26:46.480
or you can
be all right perhaps.

26:46.564 --> 26:50.693
As soon as they examine it they'll know,
and they'll know you're not insane.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.777
No!

26:53.362 --> 26:56.240
For Philippe's sake,
François, I beg you.

26:57.533 --> 27:02.538
Don't you see? I was pretending
to be mad for Philippe's sake.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.333
Better that I should
be declared insane,

27:05.416 --> 27:08.044
than he should be the son
of a woman hanged for murder.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.130
I want to know.

27:11.213 --> 27:15.384
Either you tell me now,
or I give the fly to Charas.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.599
If I tell you,
will you tell them?

27:23.559 --> 27:25.478
I only want to help you.

27:25.770 --> 27:29.106
I can only
do that through them.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.485
Yes, I would tell them.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.404
Poor François.

27:39.950 --> 27:44.080
Call Charas then.
I can't tell it twice.

27:45.247 --> 27:48.167
So long as you'll
kill the fly.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.461
You promise?

27:51.587 --> 27:53.964
Yes.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.771
This is not a confession.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.607
Although I killed my husband,
I am not a murderess.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.443
I simply carried out
his last wish.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.407
A few months ago...

28:20.908 --> 28:23.703
Who's a ticklish boy?

28:23.786 --> 28:25.547
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

28:25.621 --> 28:28.082
Andre! What
a pleasant surprise.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.209
Hi, Daddy. Are you
gonna play with us?

28:30.292 --> 28:33.045
Later, Philippe. I've got to borrow
your mother for a moment.

28:33.129 --> 28:35.172
But I won't be long, I promise.

28:35.256 --> 28:36.549
I'll tell you what.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.426
Before you go to bed,
I'll play with you, all right?

28:38.509 --> 28:40.594
- Promise?
- Promise.

28:40.678 --> 28:44.140
- All right then. I'll play with Dandelo.
- Good.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.769
Be gentle with her, Philippe.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.733
Come on. I've got
to show you something.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.985
But, Andre, we don't see you
for days on end.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.821
- Then suddenly you expect...
- Don't argue with me. Come on.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.823
But...

29:37.610 --> 29:40.446
I'd no idea you'd made
so many changes.

29:40.529 --> 29:43.616
- A completely new line of research.
- Let me guess.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.618
- The permanent battery.
- Mmm-mmm.

29:45.701 --> 29:48.245
Not the portable reactor?

29:48.329 --> 29:50.915
I'll show you,

29:50.998 --> 29:53.667
but there must be absolutely
no mention of this made to anyone.

29:53.751 --> 29:56.921
- Of course.
- It's much too important.

29:57.004 --> 30:00.299
Helene, you're the first
to see a miracle.

30:14.230 --> 30:17.441
- Remember this?
- Oh, of course.

30:17.525 --> 30:20.486
Our wedding present
from my devoted and very rich Aunt Bess.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.321
Mmm-hmm. The family heirloom.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.612
Hurry, put them on.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.826
Now watch the box.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.782
You can take your goggles
off now, darling.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.839
It's gone.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.674
Come on.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.860
- It's the same one.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.780
- Have you turned magician?
- In a way.

32:27.863 --> 32:31.367
For a split second, an infinitesimal
part of a second,

32:31.450 --> 32:33.410
this was disintegrated.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.746
For one little moment
it no longer existed,

32:35.829 --> 32:39.083
only atoms traveling through space
at the speed of light.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.670
Then here, a moment later, integrated
again into the shape of an ashtray.

32:42.753 --> 32:45.214
Oh, you're joking.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.801
Doesn't sound possible,
does it? But it is true.

32:48.884 --> 32:52.137
It is impossible. You're
playing some joke on me.

32:52.221 --> 32:53.973
Take television.
What happens?

32:54.056 --> 32:56.475
A string of electrons,
sound and picture impulses,

32:56.558 --> 32:58.727
are transmitted
through wires or the air.

32:58.811 --> 33:01.188
The TV camera is
the disintegrator.

33:01.271 --> 33:05.818
Your set unscrambles, or integrates,
the electrons back into pictures and sound.

33:05.901 --> 33:09.989
- Yes, but this is different.
- Why?

33:10.072 --> 33:13.033
Well, because it's impossible!

33:13.575 --> 33:17.204
Fifty years ago, if my father
were told he could sit in Montreal,

33:17.287 --> 33:20.249
and watch a World Series in New York
the exact time it was happening,

33:20.332 --> 33:21.709
he'd say
it was impossible.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.921
- This is the same principle exactly.
- But it's not the same.

33:26.380 --> 33:29.258
- This is solid.
- Oh, no, it's not.

33:29.425 --> 33:33.637
To your touch, maybe it is.
In reality, it's billions of atoms,

33:33.721 --> 33:36.098
which we believe are only
a series of electrical impulses.

33:36.682 --> 33:37.683
Uh...

33:38.475 --> 33:41.687
You actually did this?
It's no trick?

33:42.980 --> 33:44.273
No.

33:44.356 --> 33:48.777
I can transport matter, anything,
at the speed of light perfectly.

33:50.112 --> 33:53.699
Oh, of course this is
only a crude beginning.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.827
But I've been lucky enough to stumble
on the most important discovery

33:56.910 --> 33:59.079
since man sawed off
the end of a tree trunk

33:59.163 --> 34:00.497
and found the wheel.

34:01.415 --> 34:04.835
The disintegrator-integrator will
completely change life as we know it.

34:04.918 --> 34:07.212
Think what it'll mean.
Food. Anything.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.505
Even humans will go through
one of these devices.

34:09.590 --> 34:14.803
No need for cars or railways or airplanes,
even spaceships. We'll set up matter

34:14.887 --> 34:18.389
transmitting-receiving stations throughout
the world, and later, the universe.

34:18.474 --> 34:20.266
There'll never
be a need of famine.

34:20.350 --> 34:24.396
Surpluses can be sent instantaneously
at almost no cost anywhere.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.483
Humanity need never
want or fear again.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.445
I'm a very fortunate man.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.032
I'm a very fortunate woman.

34:45.167 --> 34:48.295
I hope you don't transmit me.
I wouldn't want to come out like this.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.339
What do you mean?

35:03.268 --> 35:06.146
Well, it doesn't matter,
does it, Andre?

35:18.534 --> 35:20.452
Andre.

36:04.288 --> 36:07.124
It's perfect.
Everything checks.

37:28.622 --> 37:30.999
It's perfect.

37:31.083 --> 37:34.753
Perfect.

37:37.005 --> 37:40.467
Dandelo!
What's the matter? You hungry?

37:51.812 --> 37:53.522
There we are.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.607
That's it.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.139
You won't feel a thing,
Dandelo.

38:27.222 --> 38:30.517
And tomorrow you'll be
the most famous cat in all the world.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.396
Dandelo!

39:31.745 --> 39:33.663
Dandelo.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.094
Hello?

39:47.177 --> 39:50.097
Oh, François,
how nice to hear you.

39:50.180 --> 39:53.225
Important?
You're getting married.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.395
No.

39:56.478 --> 40:01.024
No, not yet.
I think I like it this way.

40:01.108 --> 40:05.987
It's just that there's no hurry.
Is Andre there?

40:06.113 --> 40:07.739
Andre?

40:07.823 --> 40:10.575
I've seen him about two hours
in the last two weeks.

40:10.659 --> 40:13.912
He eats and sleeps in his lab.
He won't talk or answer the telephone.

40:13.995 --> 40:17.249
- I don't want to hear one more word!
- I don't want to!

40:17.332 --> 40:20.127
- You're going to eat your dinner now!
- I don't want to!

40:21.336 --> 40:24.297
Philippe's acting like a juvenile
delinquent. Dandelo's disappeared.

40:24.381 --> 40:26.925
I've even got to go to Professor
Augier's this evening alone.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.927
You know how he is, Helene.

40:29.010 --> 40:32.764
It's just until he solves his problem,
whatever it is. Be patient.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.476
How you men stick together.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.772
Anything I can do? All right, François.
I'll tell him if I see him.

40:40.856 --> 40:43.233
I gotta run now, François.
Good-bye.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.071
Well!
Where have you been?

40:51.116 --> 40:54.411
Listen, darling, I'm sorry
about the last couple of weeks.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.663
I had a little setback,
but it's all right now.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.082
- Oh, I didn't mind.
- Hmm?

40:59.166 --> 41:02.586
Well, maybe just a little.

41:02.669 --> 41:05.755
Call Augier and cancel out.
We're going to celebrate by ourselves.

41:05.839 --> 41:08.008
Wonderful.
I didn't want to go anyway.

41:08.091 --> 41:11.136
François just called about some
special equipment. He's sending it now.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.472
Good. By the time
you've changed, I'll be ready.

41:13.555 --> 41:16.975
- Changed?
- I've got tickets for the ballet.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.394
- The ballet!
- We'll eat at the Tour d'Eiffel first.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.813
- Oh, wonderful!
- Now hurry.

42:44.104 --> 42:48.066
We'll finish a delightful evening
with reintegrated champagne.

42:48.149 --> 42:49.859
Finish?

42:49.943 --> 42:53.655
- Well, not quite.
- Oh? What then?

42:53.738 --> 42:55.657
What do you suggest?

42:57.284 --> 42:59.536
You're in
an unscientific mood.

42:59.619 --> 43:02.080
You don't approve?

43:02.163 --> 43:05.000
I didn't say that.

43:05.417 --> 43:07.752
Will the champagne
be as good as ever?

43:07.836 --> 43:10.672
Exactly the same,
bubble for bubble.

43:17.429 --> 43:19.681
Here.

44:05.894 --> 44:08.063
- The label's perfect!
- Of course!

44:08.146 --> 44:10.231
Oh, it's so cold!

44:12.150 --> 44:14.903
And it'll stay that way until
I show you something else.

44:14.986 --> 44:15.987
Oh?

44:22.369 --> 44:25.413
No, Andre, don't!
It might not work. I won't allow it!

44:25.497 --> 44:28.458
- It'll be all right.
- Andre, please!

44:37.175 --> 44:39.094
Put your goggles on, darling.

45:19.801 --> 45:21.720
It's astounding!
It works!

45:21.803 --> 45:25.014
I test-ran it this morning. It's all right.

45:25.098 --> 45:28.351
You've succeeded completely.
It's unbelievable.

45:28.435 --> 45:31.604
We'll have to wait and see.
I'll know for sure in a few weeks.

45:31.688 --> 45:34.566
- I don't understand.
- To see if it suffers from ill effects.

45:34.649 --> 45:37.068
- Oh.
- If it's alive in, say, a month,

45:37.318 --> 45:39.863
then we'll pronounce
the experiment successful.

45:39.946 --> 45:42.490
May I look after him?

45:42.574 --> 45:46.327
It's still a her, but you can.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.747
For one whole month
she's mine.

45:48.830 --> 45:50.957
Don't kill her
with overfeeding.

45:52.792 --> 45:55.545
It's a little frightening, isn't it?

45:55.628 --> 45:57.630
Yes.

45:57.714 --> 46:01.676
The first live experiment
was disastrous... Dandelo.

46:03.011 --> 46:05.388
Dandelo?

46:07.307 --> 46:08.850
Andre, how could you?

46:09.350 --> 46:13.688
She disintegrated perfectly but never
reappeared. I don't know why, even now.

46:13.855 --> 46:17.358
I redesigned the projecting device,
and now it's perfect.

46:17.442 --> 46:20.320
Where's she gone?

46:20.403 --> 46:22.322
Into space,

46:22.405 --> 46:26.451
in a stream of cat atoms.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.536
It'd be funny if
life weren't so sacred.

46:28.620 --> 46:31.456
Andre, promise me
one thing.

46:31.539 --> 46:34.542
No more experiments
with animals.

46:34.626 --> 46:38.880
I promise. No more
experiments with animals.

46:41.424 --> 46:44.636
It's frightening.
It's like playing God.

46:45.053 --> 46:48.264
God gives us intelligence
to uncover the wonders of nature.

46:48.348 --> 46:50.266
Without the gift,
nothing is possible.

46:50.934 --> 46:53.520
Oh, Andre, I get
so scared sometimes.

46:53.603 --> 46:55.522
The suddenness
of our age,

46:55.605 --> 46:59.776
electronics, rockets,
Earth satellites, supersonic flight,

46:59.859 --> 47:01.903
and now this.

47:01.986 --> 47:06.574
Oh, it's not so much who invents them,
it's the fact they exist.

47:06.658 --> 47:11.246
But you're not frightened of TV
or radio or X-rays or electricity,

47:11.329 --> 47:13.498
or that the Earth
is round.

47:13.581 --> 47:16.167
No, but everything's
going so fast.

47:16.251 --> 47:18.878
I'm... I'm just not ready
to take it all in.

47:18.962 --> 47:22.006
It's... It's all so quick.

47:22.924 --> 47:25.426
Just do like Philippe does.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.263
Accept them as part
of our normal life.

47:28.346 --> 47:31.766
They're facts, wonderful facts.

47:34.269 --> 47:36.646
Which brings me back
to the champagne.

47:54.455 --> 47:56.749
I love you so much, Andre.

47:56.875 --> 47:59.794
It's wonderful
being married to you.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.963
And to you, my love.

48:20.732 --> 48:23.818
You're the healthiest guinea pig
in the whole world.

48:37.498 --> 48:38.541
Andre!

48:57.143 --> 49:01.022
- You'll catch cold.
- Not today.

49:01.189 --> 49:05.777
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just looking at the sky.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.405
- Looking at God, perhaps.
- You're a strange man, Andre.

49:09.572 --> 49:12.575
So precise and practical,
and yet so...

49:12.659 --> 49:16.871
- I don't quite know how to put it.
- So aware of the infinite?

49:17.538 --> 49:21.376
The more I know,
the more sure I am I know so little.

49:21.459 --> 49:23.628
The eternal paradox.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.547
You said you were
frightened by progress.

49:26.798 --> 49:28.591
I'm filled with
the wonder of it.

49:32.220 --> 49:35.640
- Spring will soon be here.
- I like spring the best.

49:35.723 --> 49:39.978
All life growing,
renewing itself.

49:40.061 --> 49:43.523
- It's fantastic to be alive.
- How do you mean?

49:43.606 --> 49:46.651
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...

49:46.734 --> 49:49.404
I'm just so happy to be alive, that's all.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.406
So am I.

49:57.578 --> 50:00.498
Would you marry me again
if you had your time over?

50:02.417 --> 50:03.793
I think so.

50:04.085 --> 50:06.087
Well, I've got a lot to do.

50:08.881 --> 50:12.176
- Oh, François is coming to lunch.
- Oh?

50:12.260 --> 50:14.554
Bring him down to the lab.
We'll show him now.

50:14.637 --> 50:17.515
Shall I call Professor Augier
and the Air Ministry scientists too?

50:17.598 --> 50:19.559
Now, there's no hurry.

50:19.642 --> 50:24.564
I... I don't even know how or why
parts of it work yet.

50:24.647 --> 50:27.483
It's too important.
It's too impossible.

50:27.984 --> 50:31.195
Poor François.
He'll never believe it.

50:33.114 --> 50:36.284
Don't stay out too long, darling.
You look tired.

50:37.702 --> 50:40.329
The last thing I am is tired.

50:45.376 --> 50:46.544
And we're finishing
with crepes suzette.

50:46.627 --> 50:48.921
What's all the celebration about?
I'm only coming for lunch.

50:49.005 --> 50:51.049
- Andre wants to show you something.
- In the lab?

50:51.132 --> 50:53.134
- Mmm-hmm.
- What is it? Flat screen?

50:53.217 --> 50:56.262
It's better.
No more questions. Come on.

51:03.186 --> 51:05.897
I've only been invited into
the laboratory three times.

51:05.980 --> 51:08.483
Each time I came out
with a potential fortune.

51:09.067 --> 51:12.361
Oh, dear. We won't
see him for lunch.

51:12.445 --> 51:15.448
I see what you mean.
His writing gets worse and worse.

51:17.825 --> 51:20.161
Mommy! Mommy!

51:20.244 --> 51:22.038
Where are you?

51:22.121 --> 51:24.040
Coming, Philippe.

51:27.502 --> 51:28.503
Yes, darling?

51:30.713 --> 51:34.342
- I got something to show you.
- I have something to show you.

51:34.425 --> 51:37.428
I caught such a funny-looking fly.
You want to see it?

51:37.512 --> 51:40.932
Let it go. You know your father
disapproves of you catching insects.

51:41.015 --> 51:43.935
But this isn't like
any other fly I've ever seen.

51:44.018 --> 51:47.105
It has a funny white head
and sort of white leg.

51:47.188 --> 51:51.442
Now, you let it go at once.
Go along. Do as you're told. Go on.

51:54.028 --> 51:55.571
Look at all that dirt
you brought in.

52:05.164 --> 52:08.042
Best fly I ever caught.

52:16.634 --> 52:20.012
- Was there anything else, madame?
- No, thank you. Good night.

52:20.096 --> 52:24.058
Shall I leave something for the master?
Didn't touch a bite of his dinner.

52:24.725 --> 52:25.726
Oh?

52:25.893 --> 52:27.979
I fetched up his tray about an hour ago.

52:28.062 --> 52:32.316
It was still outside the door.
Had his favorite pastry on it too.

52:32.692 --> 52:36.154
Never mind. He probably didn't hear
you knock. I'll see if he wants anything.

52:36.237 --> 52:38.322
Thank you.
Good night, madame.

52:38.406 --> 52:40.366
Good night, Emma.

52:56.757 --> 53:01.888
Andre? Andre, I'm going to bed now.
Is there anything you want?

53:02.180 --> 53:04.098
Andre!

53:14.317 --> 53:17.028
"Helene,
I've had some trouble."

53:17.111 --> 53:19.363
Trouble?

53:19.447 --> 53:22.992
Andre, what's the matter?
Answer me.

53:25.369 --> 53:30.458
"I'm counting on you not to lose
your nerve, for only you can help me."

53:30.625 --> 53:32.752
"I've had a serious accident."

53:32.835 --> 53:34.712
"But I'm not in danger
at the moment,"

53:34.795 --> 53:38.007
"although it's a matter
of life or death."

53:38.090 --> 53:40.509
Andre!

53:41.302 --> 53:44.555
"It's no good calling to me
or saying anything."

53:44.639 --> 53:47.391
"I can't answer.
I can't speak."

53:47.475 --> 53:50.436
"You've got to do exactly
and very carefully what I tell you."

53:50.519 --> 53:53.356
"Knock three times to show
you understand and agree,"

53:53.439 --> 53:56.901
"then fetch me a bowl of milk
laced with rum."

53:58.069 --> 54:01.489
Bowl of milk? Andre!

54:44.323 --> 54:46.909
- Anything I can do, madame?
- No. No, loan manage.

54:46.993 --> 54:49.203
Go back to bed, Emma.

54:50.413 --> 54:52.373
Good night, madame.

55:01.215 --> 55:02.216
Ah!

55:14.395 --> 55:16.731
"When you knock,
I'll open the door."

55:16.814 --> 55:19.650
"Walk over to my desk
and put the milk on it."

55:19.734 --> 55:24.322
"Then go into the other lab
and try to find a fly."

55:24.405 --> 55:26.699
A fly?

55:26.782 --> 55:29.285
"You will easily recognize it.
Its head is white."

55:31.579 --> 55:33.539
Philippe-

55:35.166 --> 55:38.127
Oh, Andre.

55:38.878 --> 55:42.423
"Don't hurt it.
Just give it to me."

55:42.506 --> 55:46.135
"Before you come in,
you must promise to obey me implicitly."

55:46.260 --> 55:50.348
"Do not look at me.
Talking is useless. I cannot answer."

55:50.431 --> 55:53.476
"Knock three times to show
I have your promise."

55:53.559 --> 55:56.187
"My life is in your hands."

56:24.799 --> 56:26.967
You can depend on me, darling.

57:14.348 --> 57:16.016
It's not in here.

57:18.144 --> 57:20.896
If you can't talk, knock.

57:20.980 --> 57:23.816
Knock once for "yes" and twice for "no."
Do you understand?

57:26.026 --> 57:28.529
We'll find the fly tomorrow.
I promise.

57:28.612 --> 57:31.073
Just as soon as it's light,
I'll start looking.

57:31.824 --> 57:33.701
Now, why don't you go to bed?

57:33.784 --> 57:36.245
I'll help you.
No one will see you. I promise.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.794
Philippe caught a fly
this morning.

57:43.878 --> 57:46.714
He said its head was white.
I didn't see it.

57:47.882 --> 57:49.216
I made him let it go.

58:36.597 --> 58:39.683
"Come back in morning.
Will type explanation."

58:39.767 --> 58:44.355
"Need you fresh and strong tomorrow.
Poor darling. Sorry."

58:50.152 --> 58:53.614
I'm all right now, darling.
Don't worry.

58:53.989 --> 58:57.117
I'll find that fly.

58:57.201 --> 58:58.786
Do you need
anything tonight?

59:02.122 --> 59:05.626
Darling, please try
and get some sleep.

59:07.419 --> 59:09.338
Good night, darling.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.277
Andre.

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:57.488
<i>"Remember
the ashtray experiment?</i>

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.156
<i>"I've had a similar accident."</i>

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:02.034
<i>"I transmitted myself
successfully yesterday morning."</i>

01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:05.537
<i>"But in the second experiment,
a fly which I did not notice"</i>

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:07.665
<i>"was in the disintegrator with me."</i>

01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:10.125
<i>"When we integrated again,
our atoms were mixed."</i>

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:13.170
<i>"Now my only hope
is to find the fly."</i>

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:17.299
<i>"I've got to go through the machine
once more and pray our atoms untangle."</i>

01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:21.762
<i>"If you can't find it,
I'll have to destroy myself."</i>

01:01:28.769 --> 01:01:30.813
Can I come back in?

01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:38.070
Don't worry, Andre. I'll find that fly.
It can't be far away.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:42.658
But you mustn't talk about
destroying yourself. You mustn't.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:47.871
I'll call Professor Augier and the other
scientists. They can help you. I...

01:01:47.955 --> 01:01:51.375
Don't be angry, Andre.
I only thought that...

01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:54.712
Promise me that you
won't do anything.

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:02.720
Let me see your face.
I won't be afraid.

01:02:05.806 --> 01:02:07.766
All right.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:13.313
All right, Andre.
All right.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:30.122
- Flies, madame?
- Yes. Close the windows.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:35.961
- Catch flies?
- I told you, Emma.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:39.298
A fly escaped from the lab.
We've got to find it.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:43.427
- It's got a white head.
- Mommy!

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:57.232
I don't know what's
gotten into this house.

01:02:57.316 --> 01:02:59.234
Mommy!

01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:03.614
- Look. I caught lots of them.
- Where is it?

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:06.492
- Are you sure you caught it?
- Oh, the white one.

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:08.577
No. I haven't caught it yet.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.663
I told you to find that fly.

01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:16.126
I'm sorry, Philippe, darling,
but you've got to find it.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:18.629
The white one,
only the white one.

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:38.148
- Gotcha!
- You fool!

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:43.070
I said catch them!
Don't kill them!

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:50.244
I'm sorry, Emma.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:53.288
Please, just catch them.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.432
Madame, there's one in the hall.

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:15.269
Where? Where is it?

01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:33.787
Oh, it's no good, Emma.
We'll never find it.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.918
Philippe?

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.470
Make some supper, Emma,
would you?

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:53.098
I'm sorry.
It's... It's just that...

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.267
Come on, Philippe.

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:07.988
Go and get washed up for dinner.
There's a good boy.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.573
All right, Mommy.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.575
Oh, Philippe.

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.543
I see it.

01:05:22.044 --> 01:05:24.463
Don't move.

01:05:41.188 --> 01:05:43.732
Go and get some sugar, quick.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:02.668
Give me the sugar.
And close those doors.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.059
Now, stay back.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.491
Got him!

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:37.244
- Good boy, Philippe. Careful now.
- Let me see.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.247
Oh, no.

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:50.340
It's in back of the curtain!

01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:55.887
Oh, don't harm it.

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:02.019
Don't hurt it.

01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:07.607
Oh, God,
don't let it get out.

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:11.361
You try and keep it behind the curtain.
I'll get it from outside.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:55.614
Oh, no. Oh, God...

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.576
Please, God, don't let it...

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:19.095
Don't cry, Mommy.
Please don't cry.

01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:22.724
We'll catch it tomorrow.
Don't worry.

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:24.725
Please don't worry.

01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:34.444
Andre.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:51.002
We caught the fly today,
but it escaped out into the garden.

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:54.548
I'll look for it again tomorrow.

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:01.720
You eat. I'll read this here.

01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:42.345
<i>"if you had caught the fly,
you would not be reading this."</i>

01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:46.183
<i>"I know you will never catch it now.
It's hopeless."</i>

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.477
<i>"There are things
man should never experiment with."</i>

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.982
<i>"Now I must destroy everything,
all evidence, even myself."</i>

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:58.111
<i>"No one must ever know what
I discovered. It's too dangerous."</i>

01:09:58.195 --> 01:10:03.158
<i>"I've thought of a way.
It's not easy, but I need your help."</i>

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:10.749
Andre!

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:19.216
You can still reason, Andre.
You've got no right to destroy yourself.

01:10:19.299 --> 01:10:21.718
You mustn't think about it.

01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:23.303
You've still got
your intelligence.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:25.138
You're still a man
with a soul.

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:27.766
You've no right
to destroy yourself.

01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:32.562
We'll find that fly tomorrow.
I know we will.

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:08.556
Think easy.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.351
But you've got to give me more time.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:13.853
Why?
Why won't you wait?

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:47.304
Then see Professor Augier and
the other scientists. They'll help you.

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:50.515
They'll do anything to help you.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:55.478
I've another idea.
You remember the ashtray experiment?

01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:58.398
Go through again.
It worked before.

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:01.359
Why?

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:08.742
Please try it.
You've got to try it.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:18.335
Please, Andre,
for my sake.

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:21.296
Maybe it will work.
I beg you.

01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:30.096
Oh, darling, I love you
and I want you so much.

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.350
Please, please let this
come out right.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.314
Hurry, darling.
It will work.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.027
It has worked, hasn't it?

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.032
You'll be all right now.
I know it's worked.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.763
No! No! No!

01:21:34.682 --> 01:21:36.893
A strange story, Mrs. Delambre.

01:21:36.976 --> 01:21:40.021
It's almost impossible
to believe, isn't it?

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:42.106
- What happened to his notes?
- He destroyed them.

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:45.776
- And the writing on the blackboard?
- I rubbed it out.

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.778
I see.

01:21:47.862 --> 01:21:51.365
Well, I must be going.
Thank you for telling me.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:54.076
Inspector,

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.163
it wasn't wrong
to destroy the thing?

01:21:57.997 --> 01:22:00.041
A fly-headed human? No.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:05.004
It wasn't Andre.
I couldn't have hurt Andre.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:09.050
But I'm glad,
I'm glad the thing is dead.

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:11.677
I'll see you out, Inspector.

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:26.025
- Inspector...
- I'll be with you in a moment.

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:47.546
- Inspector...
- Do you believe the story?

01:22:48.047 --> 01:22:50.633
Well, it explains all the facts,

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:53.594
the reason for the press,
the fly, everything.

01:22:53.678 --> 01:22:56.722
True. But I asked you
if you believed it.

01:22:57.098 --> 01:23:00.643
Oh, I'm only a policeman,
not a science fiction enthusiast.

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:03.896
But I do not believe what she said.
It... it can't happen.

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:07.858
But you don't...
Well, I... I mean, you didn't know Andre.

01:23:07.942 --> 01:23:10.069
He was a genius
in some ways.

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:14.615
Possibly. But matter cannot be
transmitted. Oh, the story is impossible.

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:24.166
I'll be back at 10:00 with a warrant
for her arrest on the charge of murder.

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:25.835
Nurse Andersone
is under strict instructions

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:27.628
not to leave her for any reason.

01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:31.382
But, Inspector,
it might be the truth.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.176
It is the truth, to her.

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.430
I'm satisfied now.
She's quite insane. She won't hang.

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:40.266
- Well, I'm not satisfied.
- I wish I could help you, monsieur.

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:43.894
The lady's in need
of a doctor's care, permanently.

01:23:44.437 --> 01:23:48.607
There's no telling whom she might
attack next. Perhaps the boy.

01:23:49.608 --> 01:23:52.611
But there must be
something we can do to prove...

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:54.113
There is.

01:23:56.657 --> 01:23:58.117
Show me the fly.

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:21.432
- Good morning, Monsieur François.
- Good morning, Emma.

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:24.643
- How's the mistress, sir?
- Oh, as well as can be expected.

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:27.063
- Such a lovely lady.
- Yes.

01:24:27.146 --> 01:24:31.734
Emma, when you had that mad
search for a fly, did you see it?

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.528
- Oh, yes, I saw it.
- What did it look like?

01:24:34.612 --> 01:24:37.698
Oh, just a fly.
I'd say it was a bluebottle.

01:24:37.782 --> 01:24:39.700
You know, quite a large one.

01:24:39.784 --> 01:24:43.913
- Did it... Did it look any different?
- Not to me it didn't.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:46.916
She and Philippe were saying
its head was white.

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:50.252
- But it was just a fly.
- Thank you.

01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:51.754
May I fix you some breakfast, sir?

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:53.339
Nice cup of tea? Some coffee?

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.341
No, thank you.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:46.892
Help! Help me!

01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:48.894
Help me!

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.443
Help! Help me!

01:25:56.527 --> 01:25:59.488
Please help me!

01:25:59.572 --> 01:26:01.949
Help me!

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:30.978
We can manage quite easily.
Thank you, Mr. Delambre.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.106
Well, I... I thought
I ought to be here.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:35.816
Do you wish
to check the warrant?

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:40.696
- As next of kin you have the right.
- No, I'm sure it must be all right.

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:54.126
- Madame? Time to get up now.
- Hmm?

01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:57.546
Oh, I slept so well.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:01.842
- Wonderfully. Is it a nice day?
- Yes.

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:11.810
- I think I'll have the silk one.
- Take this one.

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:15.314
- You must be warm.
- But I'm not going out.

01:27:21.278 --> 01:27:22.488
Come in.

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:29.161
- Good morning, Mrs. Delambre.
- Inspector.

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:35.042
But I...
I don't understand.

01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:38.754
I have a warrant
for your arrest for murder.

01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:40.547
And I must caution you.
Anything you say

01:27:40.631 --> 01:27:43.217
can be taken down
and used in evidence.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.636
But, Inspector,
I told you everything.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:47.846
It is for the court
to decide.

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:52.142
But you said it was not wrong
to kill a thing.

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:56.105
- You have to come with us, madame.
- François, didn't you show them?

01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:58.107
You didn't destroy it?

01:27:59.108 --> 01:28:00.901
Inspector, you saw it.

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:03.153
I'm afraid I did not,
Mrs. Delambre.

01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:09.702
I lied to you, Helene.
I never had it. I never had it.

01:28:11.662 --> 01:28:13.580
You never had it?

01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:17.543
If you'll just come
with us, madame.

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:19.628
You never saw it?

01:28:19.712 --> 01:28:22.965
Leave her alone.
She doesn't have to go with you.

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:25.384
I demand that I first
have time to talk to my attorney.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.136
Dr. Ejoute will care for her.

01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:30.097
I've already consulted with him.
The patient is ready to leave.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:32.349
- I don't believe it.
- I have his diagnosis,

01:28:32.433 --> 01:28:35.644
- and his authority.
- No, no, wait.

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:38.063
Don't make things more
difficult, monsieur.

01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:40.149
- Here you go, ma'am. You'll be all right.
- No!

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:44.653
François, don't let them take me!
Don't let them lock me up!

01:28:44.737 --> 01:28:46.613
François, please...

01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:49.825
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Philippe.

01:28:51.577 --> 01:28:54.121
Oh, François, do something.
Don't let him see me like this.

01:28:54.288 --> 01:28:55.831
Please!

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:04.381
Philippe. You can't see her,
Philippe, not at the moment.

01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:08.927
I'll take you for a walk.
I know. I'll take you to the movies.

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:10.888
But they don't open
till this afternoon.

01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:13.599
Then I'll take you
this afternoon.

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:16.101
Is the ambulance for Mommy?

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.103
Yes.

01:29:18.187 --> 01:29:20.522
Is she going
to be all right?

01:29:20.606 --> 01:29:22.983
Yes. All right.

01:29:25.027 --> 01:29:27.738
- I ran all the way over here.
- Oh?

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:29.656
I wanted to see
how she was.

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:32.743
- I wanted her to play with me.
- She'd like that, Philippe.

01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:34.870
But she can't, not now.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:37.915
- When's Daddy coming home then?
- Soon, Philippe.

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:41.251
- I saw that funny-looking fly again.
- Oh?

01:29:41.335 --> 01:29:44.046
- Which show will we go to?
- Any...

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:46.799
You saw the fly? Where?

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:49.968
It's in a web.
A spider's going to get it.

01:29:50.052 --> 01:29:52.262
By the bench
in the garden.

01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:54.515
- You're sure?
- Oh, yes.

01:29:54.598 --> 01:29:56.517
Stay here a minute.

01:30:03.232 --> 01:30:06.402
- It's in the garden. Come quickly.
- Please, Monsieur Delambre...

01:30:06.485 --> 01:30:10.030
Philippe has seen it. It's there.
I beg of you. Please, please.

01:30:10.114 --> 01:30:11.990
All right.
Show me where.

01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:19.289
Here, Uncle François.

01:30:23.544 --> 01:30:25.421
Wait in the house.

01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:27.965
There's a good boy,
Philippe.

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:34.096
Help me! Please help me!

01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:37.516
Help! Help me!

01:30:40.269 --> 01:30:43.230
Please help me!
Please!

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:45.816
Go away! Go away!

01:30:46.859 --> 01:30:50.571
No! No! No!

01:30:58.537 --> 01:31:00.831
Charas.

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:03.208
Charas.

01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:10.966
I didn't believe it,
but you saw it.

01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:13.469
- You saw it, didn't you?
- Yes, I... I saw it.

01:31:13.552 --> 01:31:17.890
- I thought she was...
- As God is my witness, I saw the thing.

01:31:18.474 --> 01:31:19.641
It's unbelievable.

01:31:20.184 --> 01:31:22.895
I shall never forget that scream
as long as I live.

01:31:24.897 --> 01:31:27.733
You've committed murder,
just as much as Helene did.

01:31:28.275 --> 01:31:29.985
You killed a fly
with a human head.

01:31:30.068 --> 01:31:31.945
She killed a human
with a fly head.

01:31:32.362 --> 01:31:34.072
If she murdered, so did you.

01:31:34.573 --> 01:31:38.702
I know. But who's going to believe us?
They'll think we're both mad.

01:31:39.411 --> 01:31:43.332
But he could have started the press
and got under it in time.

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:44.958
It could have been suicide.

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:50.422
Andre's mind was deranged.
Helene just tried to stop him.

01:31:50.756 --> 01:31:52.508
But the stroke count?

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:58.722
I was the one who forgot to reset it
after it was used the last time.

01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:05.395
Yes. Yes.
It could have been suicide.

01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:12.819
Oh, a great shot, Philippe.

01:32:12.903 --> 01:32:16.823
- Oh, François. Thank you.
- Hello. You look wonderful.

01:32:16.907 --> 01:32:18.825
- Hi, Uncle François.
- Hi, Philippe.

01:32:18.951 --> 01:32:21.119
You taking me to the zoo
like you promised?

01:32:21.203 --> 01:32:23.539
- Yes, if your mother...
- Oh, you two run along.

01:32:23.622 --> 01:32:25.040
We'll all have dinner together later.

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:27.584
Oh, good.

01:32:28.085 --> 01:32:30.420
- Uncle.
- Yes?

01:32:30.504 --> 01:32:32.339
Mommy told me
about Daddy.

01:32:32.839 --> 01:32:35.467
Something
she said to ask you.

01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:37.678
Why did he die?

01:32:41.807 --> 01:32:43.559
Well, Philippe,

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:46.353
he died
because of his work.

01:32:46.436 --> 01:32:50.065
He was like an...
Like an explorer in a wild country,

01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:51.942
where no one
had even been before.

01:32:52.234 --> 01:32:54.444
He was searching
for the truth.

01:32:54.528 --> 01:32:56.655
He almost found
a great truth.

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:59.449
But for one instant,
he was careless.

01:32:59.533 --> 01:33:02.286
- That's what killed him?
- Search for the truth

01:33:02.369 --> 01:33:06.873
is the most important work in the whole
world and the most dangerous.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:10.586
I'd like that.
I'd like to be an explorer like him.

01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:14.381
- Will you help me, Uncle François?
- Yes, Philippe.

01:33:14.673 --> 01:33:17.926
- You better run and get a coat.
- Yes. Right away.

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:24.099
You're a dear one, François.
So kind and thoughtful.

01:33:24.433 --> 01:33:25.475
Thank you.

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:28.270
Here I am.

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:31.440
Well, come along, you two.
I'll see you off.
