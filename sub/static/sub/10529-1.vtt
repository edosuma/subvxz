<i>When we are children,
we believe the world is full of magic.</i>

00:45.169 --> 00:49.340
<i>We believe in myths and legends,
and that destiny awaits.</i>

00:52.468 --> 00:54.679
<i>That is the world I remember</i>

00:57.098 --> 00:59.392
<i>and the one I wish I'd never known.</i>

01:03.646 --> 01:06.023
<i>-Someone's there.
-Back in the house.</i>

01:21.747 --> 01:22.915
Daddy!

01:37.388 --> 01:38.389
Mommy!

01:38.681 --> 01:40.641
Vivian, run!

03:50.394 --> 03:52.897
Running. Always running.

03:52.939 --> 03:55.149
<i>Never know when you're gonna need it.</i>

03:55.233 --> 03:58.694
<i>Vivian, when he comes,
he'll expect you to be here.</i>

03:59.070 --> 04:00.530
<i>Well, l won't be.</i>

04:00.613 --> 04:02.949
<i>lt's an honor to be chosen, if it is you.</i>

04:02.990 --> 04:06.244
And when he leaves you,
is that an honor, too?

04:07.745 --> 04:09.997
These are the ways of our people.

04:10.081 --> 04:11.749
<i>l don't need your advice today, Aunt Astrid.</i>

04:11.832 --> 04:14.418
Oh, baby, you need something.

04:14.502 --> 04:16.629
l remember being 19, you know.

04:16.712 --> 04:18.339
<i>You're still 19.</i>

04:18.589 --> 04:19.757
Funny.

04:21.007 --> 04:23.636
When l was 19, l was pregnant.
lt was my choice.

04:23.677 --> 04:26.680
<i>And what l found was it's best to stay
where you belong.</i>

04:26.764 --> 04:28.933
lf you know where you belong.

04:29.016 --> 04:33.354
We have a home here, Vivian, a safe one.
Thanks to Gabriel.

04:35.648 --> 04:38.943
Your parents would have wanted you safe.
And you are.

04:40.861 --> 04:43.280
<i>lt's only you you're running from.</i>

04:49.578 --> 04:51.664
Are you sure this is the right address?

04:51.705 --> 04:53.999
Yes, it has to be.

05:41.922 --> 05:44.466
Vivian. Do you see anything you like?

05:45.258 --> 05:48.303
<i>-Just here to drink, Drago.
-That's what they all say.</i>

06:33.139 --> 06:34.682
ln your dreams.

06:43.107 --> 06:44.484
<i>She's shy.</i>

06:49.322 --> 06:53.284
<i>Don't give up, cousin. l think she likes you.
l see a real future there.</i>

06:53.785 --> 06:55.203
Sweet of you to say.

06:55.286 --> 06:58.831
A ring, a church wedding,
all her family would show.

06:58.915 --> 07:01.793
<i>And then for the reception,
you'd kill them all.</i>

07:02.043 --> 07:04.003
<i>l know. lt'd be magical.</i>

07:05.338 --> 07:08.466
<i>You know what we are, Vivian?
We're romantics.</i>

07:08.549 --> 07:11.093
<i>''We'' are nothing.</i>

07:12.136 --> 07:14.472
And the thing about romantics is

07:18.100 --> 07:19.852
they never give up.

07:20.978 --> 07:22.396
Hey.

07:23.773 --> 07:25.649
Yes, on top is how l imagine you.

07:25.691 --> 07:27.818
That looks fun. Can l be next?

07:27.860 --> 07:30.071
Absinthe all around. Her, too.

07:30.154 --> 07:33.157
<i>Well. Out from their caves,
if it isn't the Fortunate Five.</i>

07:33.240 --> 07:34.241
<i>We're in luck, gents.</i>

07:34.325 --> 07:36.368
My cousin deigns
to honor us with her presence.

07:36.452 --> 07:39.455
-Are you here to dance, Vivian?
-Dance. Yeah. Shake your pretty tail.

07:39.538 --> 07:42.374
<i>l'd like to see how you'll dance for Gabriel.</i>

07:46.170 --> 07:48.380
My cousin, you know you will.

07:49.924 --> 07:53.385
<i>Seven years, it's almost time.</i>

07:53.636 --> 07:56.055
He has other girls to choose from.

07:57.681 --> 07:59.183
None like you.

08:02.144 --> 08:05.105
To darling Vivian. Pride of the pack.

08:05.189 --> 08:07.816
-And her bright future.
-Vivian!

08:11.779 --> 08:13.030
Vivian.

09:30.231 --> 09:31.566
Hello?

09:33.359 --> 09:35.403
ls there somebody in here?

09:35.862 --> 09:38.865
<i>ls there somebody in here?
You're asking me?</i>

09:41.784 --> 09:44.996
Since when do they lock churches
in this country, huh?

09:47.624 --> 09:50.460
This is a sacred place. Protected.

09:50.543 --> 09:52.754
<i>Well, l didn't steal anything.</i>

09:53.796 --> 09:55.214
You an American?

10:11.147 --> 10:13.191
<i>Look, l don't need any trouble.</i>

10:13.357 --> 10:16.485
l heard about this place.
l had to find a way in.

10:16.777 --> 10:18.362
What is this?

10:19.322 --> 10:22.241
<i>They're figure studies for a graphic novel.</i>

10:25.077 --> 10:26.287
Like...

10:29.540 --> 10:30.875
Like these.

10:32.084 --> 10:35.087
-Which one has the wolves?
-The next one.

10:37.048 --> 10:39.633
<i>My name's Aiden. Aiden Galvin.</i>

10:39.717 --> 10:41.552
<i>l'm here for research.</i>

10:41.886 --> 10:43.512
And trespassing.

10:45.681 --> 10:49.018
Look. Bucharest is a treasure trove.

10:49.768 --> 10:53.230
<i>l'd heard there were places
that wolves were almost, like, worshipped.</i>

10:53.272 --> 10:55.900
<i>But l didn't think they meant it literally.</i>

10:55.983 --> 10:59.111
<i>Strictly speaking,
they're not actually wolves.</i>

10:59.236 --> 11:01.447
<i>They were called loup-garous.</i>

11:03.198 --> 11:04.992
You mean werewolves.

11:05.784 --> 11:07.828
Not as you and l think of them.

11:09.121 --> 11:12.249
<i>They weren't monsters,
not in the legends here.</i>

11:13.250 --> 11:16.754
-What were they, then?
-They were revered.

11:18.088 --> 11:20.466
They were the best of man,
the best of beast.

11:20.549 --> 11:24.136
Kind of shape-shifters, l guess.
Until they were wiped out.

11:24.261 --> 11:26.054
ln the legends.

11:34.730 --> 11:37.774
-So your comic book...
-Graphic novel.

11:39.067 --> 11:41.028
<i>lt's not about monsters?</i>

11:42.821 --> 11:44.698
Just us humans, right?

11:47.284 --> 11:50.912
Hey, were you hiding or something?
What are you doing here?

11:52.164 --> 11:55.083
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.
l'm leaving, all right, l'm outta here.</i>

11:55.167 --> 11:57.043
Just tell me your name.

11:58.503 --> 12:00.630
You do have a name, right?

12:02.507 --> 12:04.217
Do they have names?

12:07.679 --> 12:09.139
Why should we?

12:10.724 --> 12:13.310
<i>lt's bad luck to break into a church.</i>

12:13.935 --> 12:15.604
<i>Hey, what's your name?</i>

12:28.742 --> 12:30.368
<i>l don't want to come.</i>

12:30.910 --> 12:33.913
Go. Go, go, go!

13:26.799 --> 13:29.135
Let me in! Help! Please!

13:39.812 --> 13:41.397
Get out of here.

13:52.950 --> 13:56.787
<i>Oh, come on now, cousin.
lt's not like we were going to hurt her.</i>

13:57.788 --> 14:00.040
You have to let the boys have their fun.

14:00.124 --> 14:01.792
You know the law.

14:02.418 --> 14:03.544
The law.

14:03.627 --> 14:06.422
<i>What's one girl, right? And another.</i>

14:06.463 --> 14:09.049
<i>When they come,
they'll come in numbers with guns.</i>

14:09.091 --> 14:11.218
<i>And not just for you.
They'll come for all of us.</i>

14:11.302 --> 14:13.178
<i>Spoken like a bitch who's been there.</i>

14:13.262 --> 14:17.099
<i>We weren't gonna hurt her, Vivian.
We were just playing games.</i>

14:17.141 --> 14:19.143
We know the risks, Vivian, same as you.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.563
<i>Yes, see, we all know Gabriel's law.</i>

14:22.604 --> 14:26.692
<i>-''Hunt as a pack or not at all.''
-''Hunt as a pack or not at all.''</i>

14:30.362 --> 14:32.447
<i>And the laws he'll have for you.</i>

14:42.040 --> 14:43.583
<i>She's asleep.</i>

14:47.170 --> 14:48.463
Gabriel,

14:50.382 --> 14:52.801
she stayed home waiting for you.

14:55.554 --> 14:57.389
Are you afraid of me?

14:58.682 --> 14:59.641
No.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.647
You know about our tradition.

15:05.689 --> 15:08.692
Every seven years,
the leader of the pack takes a new wife.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.527
<i>Don't you mean mate?</i>

15:12.863 --> 15:17.117
Should show more respect for the rules.
Without them we cannot survive.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.036
There are prophecies

15:21.204 --> 15:23.164
about girls like you.

15:26.710 --> 15:29.379
You come from a long line of leaders,
you know.

15:29.421 --> 15:32.716
Women in your family
were legends in this city.

15:33.925 --> 15:36.803
Your father should never have gone
to America.

15:36.886 --> 15:38.888
l knew how he would end. l told him.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.974
You must have hated him very much.

15:41.057 --> 15:44.102
No.
But you know why we have survived here?

15:45.770 --> 15:48.064
<i>lt's because we stand together.</i>

15:48.940 --> 15:51.526
Your father thought of himself first.

15:52.402 --> 15:54.112
<i>Don't insult my family.</i>

15:54.153 --> 15:56.864
You have no family. You have heritage.

16:09.711 --> 16:12.255
<i>lf you're the one from the prophesy,</i>

16:13.714 --> 16:16.175
soon l will ask you to be my wife.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.638
l see what you did to Astrid.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.933
You come for one night,
she cries for a month.

16:24.016 --> 16:27.144
<i>You want to be ordinary?
You're not ordinary.</i>

16:31.399 --> 16:34.902
Ask the animal who is inside you.
She will teach you.

17:20.489 --> 17:21.615
Fear.

17:24.451 --> 17:26.869
Was l not worthy of your respect?

17:29.665 --> 17:32.584
No trace of admiration?

17:36.588 --> 17:39.967
<i>That's because you don't know the real me.</i>

18:27.472 --> 18:30.767
Hey, scumbag, you are free to go.

18:32.602 --> 18:37.065
Detectives? Where are you taking me? Huh?

18:37.107 --> 18:40.068
What is this? Where are you taking me?

19:05.635 --> 19:08.471
My friend, your arrest has made the paper.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.265
You must be very proud.

19:11.307 --> 19:14.268
What is this? And who are you?

19:15.770 --> 19:17.980
Please, have a drink with me.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.860
<i>Absinthe, it's an old ritual of mine.</i>

19:26.656 --> 19:29.075
Why did you pay to get me out?

19:30.993 --> 19:31.994
Drink.

19:39.460 --> 19:43.089
You know, there are countries
where they call this poison.

19:43.506 --> 19:48.094
<i>Of course, it doesn't come in a dirty needle.
And it's not sold to children.</i>

19:49.929 --> 19:53.057
What you want? You want a cut?

19:54.308 --> 19:55.726
You want in?

19:55.768 --> 19:59.563
My friend,
you have escaped the law till now.

19:59.897 --> 20:02.358
But in this city, we are the law.

20:02.983 --> 20:05.736
As we have been for 5,000 years.

20:10.991 --> 20:14.453
<i>We'll find out
who you've been selling your poison to.</i>

20:14.995 --> 20:17.915
For tomorrow, tradition reigns.

20:22.002 --> 20:24.630
Well, that makes all the difference.

20:47.277 --> 20:50.280
<i>-Your chocolates.
-That's so nice. Thanks.</i>

21:31.112 --> 21:33.907
Hey! Hey, Wolf-Girl!

23:34.693 --> 23:37.196
Hello, sweet tooth. Ready to hunt?

23:38.655 --> 23:41.992
All hail the queen of the night,
the beauty of Bucharest!

23:42.034 --> 23:44.203
She will hunt and hunt supreme.

23:44.286 --> 23:45.996
Mama.

23:54.546 --> 23:56.256
<i>Willem, so he's chasing the meat, right?</i>

23:56.340 --> 23:58.926
<i>Lands on it, turns it around, it's Gregor.</i>

24:00.552 --> 24:02.012
-Did l tell you?
-No, l had no idea.

24:02.054 --> 24:03.263
l had no idea.

24:21.114 --> 24:22.741
Hell of a night.

24:57.525 --> 25:00.487
<i>''ln fear l hurried this way and that.</i>

25:00.528 --> 25:03.823
<i>''l had the taste of blood and chocolate
in my mouth,</i>

25:03.907 --> 25:07.619
<i>''the one as hateful as the other.''
Remember that?</i>

25:08.161 --> 25:09.537
<i>Steppenwolf.</i>

25:10.204 --> 25:12.457
<i>We're all lost souls, Vivian.</i>

25:14.417 --> 25:16.836
<i>At least we're lost together.</i>

26:01.047 --> 26:03.132
My lords and ladies,

26:03.215 --> 26:06.552
we gather tonight
as our ancestors did for all time.

26:06.844 --> 26:10.765
The first night of the full moon
when we gather as one.

26:10.931 --> 26:12.433
For we are one.

26:14.018 --> 26:15.769
And we hunt as one.

26:17.980 --> 26:22.192
We have survived for 5,000 years
by hiding who we are.

26:23.986 --> 26:28.115
We have been chased from everywhere,
England, France, America,

26:29.325 --> 26:30.784
but not here.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.037
Never here.

26:35.664 --> 26:38.625
This thing before you

26:41.170 --> 26:42.713
is called man.

26:43.672 --> 26:46.592
But l call it menace.

26:48.343 --> 26:50.971
The race of man is corrupt at its core.

26:51.513 --> 26:54.725
<i>The only thing it's good at is destruction!</i>

26:54.808 --> 26:57.311
And so, once in a while,
we must make an example

26:57.394 --> 27:00.731
to show this menace
that we may be outnumbered,

27:01.106 --> 27:03.483
but we will never be outhunted.

27:16.246 --> 27:17.873
So on this night,

27:20.751 --> 27:22.961
let nature grace us to return

27:23.628 --> 27:25.422
to who we truly are

27:26.173 --> 27:29.718
in the wild where we once lived.

27:45.275 --> 27:47.235
Please. l swear...

27:47.402 --> 27:49.904
There is a river within those woods.

27:51.656 --> 27:54.534
lf you reach the other side,
you win your life.

27:54.993 --> 27:56.578
And if not,

27:57.162 --> 27:59.497
<i>glory to the loup-garou who takes it.</i>

28:07.046 --> 28:08.298
Run free.

28:13.052 --> 28:15.972
No one ever reaches the river.

29:37.511 --> 29:38.804
Help me!

30:50.792 --> 30:52.419
<i>lt's who you are</i>

30:53.795 --> 30:55.547
and always will be.

31:45.012 --> 31:47.723
Help! Help!

32:35.896 --> 32:40.567
<i>Bunâ, any mail for me? Letters, packages?
l'm in 204.</i>

32:40.818 --> 32:42.319
No mail today.

32:43.237 --> 32:44.905
Did you even check?

32:45.197 --> 32:46.991
No mail for nobody.

32:55.707 --> 32:56.792
<i>Where'd you get this?</i>

32:59.795 --> 33:02.047
Yes, l am being careful. Thank you.

33:02.673 --> 33:04.842
<i>Why don't you go sell something
for a change?</i>

33:09.012 --> 33:12.099
<i>lt's not gonna taste any better
with you standing there watching me.</i>

33:12.182 --> 33:13.684
Hey, Wolf-Girl.

33:16.353 --> 33:18.313
<i>Don't ever call me that.</i>

33:18.480 --> 33:21.066
So give me something else to call you.

33:21.149 --> 33:22.901
How did you find me?

33:23.151 --> 33:24.403
Find who?

33:26.279 --> 33:27.489
Vivian.

33:29.032 --> 33:30.242
<i>Look, l'm working. l can't talk.</i>

33:30.325 --> 33:32.285
<i>And l really don't think
you should be back here.</i>

33:32.369 --> 33:34.079
So ask me to leave.

33:37.374 --> 33:38.375
Leave.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.838
Now ask me like you mean it.

33:42.963 --> 33:45.382
<i>What's it been, two, three weeks?</i>

33:45.465 --> 33:47.968
What are you still doing in Romania?

33:48.343 --> 33:49.928
Trying to work.

33:52.097 --> 33:55.392
<i>-Don't you have a home to go back to?
-No, l don't.</i>

33:56.351 --> 33:58.561
But l do have a train ticket in a few days.

33:58.645 --> 34:01.690
And l was hoping
to spend some of them with you.

34:02.148 --> 34:05.777
<i>Yeah, well, that wouldn't make my boyfriend
really happy.</i>

34:05.985 --> 34:06.986
Oh.

34:09.030 --> 34:13.243
Would you be at a church at 2:00
in the morning if you had a boyfriend?

34:19.415 --> 34:22.502
<i>Why do you always run from me?
That's twice now, you've run from me.</i>

34:22.585 --> 34:24.629
Are my drawings that bad?

34:27.215 --> 34:31.010
-You have to go.
-That is starting to sound like you mean it.

34:33.513 --> 34:34.681
What do you want with me?

34:34.722 --> 34:38.851
l wanna know who you are
and what you love and what you dream.

34:38.935 --> 34:41.020
l want to know
what you were doing there that night.

34:41.103 --> 34:42.688
And l should just tell you?

34:42.730 --> 34:46.192
<i>This coming from a guy who doesn't even
put his name on his comic books?</i>

34:46.275 --> 34:48.069
You read my books?

34:48.152 --> 34:49.737
l guess the library is out
of everything else, huh?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.280
You need to leave now.

34:51.364 --> 34:53.032
<i>One night. That's all l'm asking.</i>

34:53.074 --> 34:57.036
Otherwise, l will be here,
all day, every day, buying chocolates.

34:58.037 --> 35:00.540
Piata Romana. Tomorrow night, 7:00.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.291
7:00.

35:02.875 --> 35:05.378
<i>lt's for you, Wolf-Girl.</i>

35:09.131 --> 35:11.425
Hi. Health inspector.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.144
<i>-What's that?
-Trash.</i>

35:35.407 --> 35:36.951
Give me that.

35:37.034 --> 35:40.871
What, your trash? Your human trash?
Now, why would...

35:41.997 --> 35:43.958
<i>-Oh, well, now.
-He doesn't know.</i>

35:43.999 --> 35:45.834
Well, that much seems obvious.

35:45.876 --> 35:47.670
<i>He's drawing pictures
for a book on loup-garous.</i>

35:47.711 --> 35:49.380
l showed interest.

35:49.672 --> 35:52.383
-Did you?
-Not like that.

35:52.466 --> 35:54.593
<i>No? Didn't model your tail for him?</i>

35:54.677 --> 35:57.221
<i>He doesn't know, Rafe. Leave him alone.</i>

35:57.304 --> 35:59.431
<i>Now, cousin, why wouldn't l?</i>

36:01.517 --> 36:05.521
<i>You want to have a meat-boy, l don't care.
l don't care if you have 100.</i>

36:06.021 --> 36:09.066
<i>Just don't tell any stories
that you shouldn't.</i>

36:10.359 --> 36:13.320
<i>They're good for fun, you know, pretty ones.</i>

36:15.364 --> 36:16.782
They just never let us be ourselves.

36:16.865 --> 36:18.909
Like that girl you killed?

36:19.826 --> 36:21.620
lf he finds out it was you...

36:21.703 --> 36:23.705
This will be my pack one day.

36:23.747 --> 36:27.626
My rules, my law.
So l will do what l want, when l want.

36:27.709 --> 36:30.295
And your pretty mouth will stay shut.

36:31.588 --> 36:35.425
Now, run along, little Vivian.
The world must have its sweets.

36:41.681 --> 36:42.682
Lovely!

36:42.766 --> 36:44.226
<i>-You did it again.
-That's the second time.</i>

36:44.309 --> 36:45.685
<i>You're too good at this.</i>

36:49.397 --> 36:51.191
You, we need to talk.

36:58.573 --> 37:01.368
How are you, Gabriel? Business good?

37:02.285 --> 37:05.330
<i>How's the bitch-du-jour
you left my mother for?</i>

37:07.666 --> 37:10.502
Have you and your friends
been hunting on your own?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.128
Never.

37:13.588 --> 37:16.508
There are rumors. You were seen with her.

37:17.175 --> 37:20.011
<i>-Did Vivian say this?
-You didn't track her?</i>

37:21.221 --> 37:24.015
-Well, not to hunt. lt was a game.
-A game?

37:26.392 --> 37:28.269
Rafe, you are my son.

37:29.354 --> 37:31.981
<i>But if it's true, l can't protect you.</i>

37:32.232 --> 37:34.609
<i>-l won't.
-Vivian's a liar.</i>

37:34.692 --> 37:38.571
This has nothing to do with her.
Did you hunt that girl or not?

37:39.989 --> 37:43.201
<i>l didn't touch a hair on her pretty head.</i>

37:56.089 --> 37:58.549
lf man suspects we are still here,

37:59.342 --> 38:01.552
he will exterminate us.

38:01.636 --> 38:04.138
-We must rule this city from the shadows.
-Because we fear them.

38:04.222 --> 38:06.182
We are millions no more.

38:08.434 --> 38:10.853
Please, hear my warning.

38:15.191 --> 38:18.027
Because the day
you hunt outside your pack,

38:19.320 --> 38:21.072
you are dead to it.

39:03.238 --> 39:04.990
l got it. l got it.

39:31.433 --> 39:34.603
<i>How's an American girl
end up in Romania anyhow?</i>

39:34.686 --> 39:36.313
l was born here

39:36.396 --> 39:39.983
in a community of expatriates from all over.

39:40.859 --> 39:43.528
And my parents moved to the States
when l was little,

39:43.612 --> 39:45.572
and then l moved back.

39:45.655 --> 39:47.449
Without your parents?

39:48.116 --> 39:50.702
They died in the States when l was little.

39:51.286 --> 39:53.830
<i>l've lived with my aunt ever since.</i>

39:54.789 --> 39:57.959
-Do you remember them?
-Every day.

39:59.669 --> 40:03.798
My aunt says that they
used to take me to that church all the time.

40:07.260 --> 40:10.013
<i>Do you always act
like you're being watched?</i>

40:10.096 --> 40:13.266
<i>You're not allowed to take a walk
with a handsome starving artist?</i>

40:13.350 --> 40:16.478
Who only puts his initials on his books.

40:16.853 --> 40:18.980
<i>What's he hiding from?</i>

40:19.022 --> 40:21.149
Well, l could tell you,
but l would have to kill you.

40:22.692 --> 40:26.529
<i>So, how's your book coming?
l mean, what's the city taught you?</i>

40:26.571 --> 40:29.282
That the werewolf stories
have got it all wrong.

40:29.365 --> 40:33.203
<i>ln the loup-garou legend,
they're not cursed, they're blessed.</i>

40:33.620 --> 40:37.624
<i>Like the moon turning them into wolves.
That's all how it was twisted later.</i>

40:37.957 --> 40:39.709
<i>The loup-garous
can change whenever they want.</i>

40:39.751 --> 40:43.004
<i>lt's mind over matter. Transcendence.</i>

40:43.796 --> 40:47.717
You know, they believe they will change,
and in that moment they do.

40:47.759 --> 40:50.386
Can you imagine that?
From a man to a wolf.

40:51.262 --> 40:54.390
-lt sounds beautiful.
-lt is.

40:56.517 --> 40:58.561
Supposedly, you could kill them with silver

40:58.644 --> 41:00.897
but also with fire.

41:01.355 --> 41:02.398
Really?

41:02.482 --> 41:05.485
<i>And you couldn't become one.
You know, be bitten or whatever.</i>

41:05.568 --> 41:08.362
<i>You're either born a loup-garou
or you're not.</i>

41:09.280 --> 41:13.367
<i>And in the stories they say that
if you harm a loup-garou,</i>

41:13.451 --> 41:17.580
if they bleed, that they show you just
a glimpse of what they really are.

41:17.872 --> 41:20.291
<i>lt's all in the eyes, apparently.</i>

41:31.135 --> 41:34.472
<i>Oh, no, what, this place is closed?
l can't believe it.</i>

41:34.513 --> 41:38.934
They have this fantastic cafê on the roof.
Got the best views of the whole city.

41:39.059 --> 41:40.811
Not the whole city.

41:42.771 --> 41:45.065
How about l take you somewhere?

41:49.987 --> 41:52.823
Vivian! This is private property.

41:55.701 --> 41:57.745
Never stopped you before.

42:10.924 --> 42:13.177
l have a great feeling about this.

42:32.905 --> 42:35.198
One of the richest men in the city lives here.

42:35.282 --> 42:36.366
<i>He's an art collector.</i>

42:36.450 --> 42:39.453
This is so much better than the date
l had planned.

42:42.080 --> 42:45.333
When l say run, run.

42:52.966 --> 42:56.678
-You never said run.
-Run.

43:05.020 --> 43:08.523
Now, this is the best view of the whole city.

43:16.406 --> 43:19.576
<i>They're all that's left of Bucharest castle.</i>

43:20.243 --> 43:23.413
Built by the Magyar princes
in the 10th century.

43:23.496 --> 43:26.499
<i>lt was said that the princes' bloodline
was loup-garou.</i>

43:26.583 --> 43:31.296
<i>So when the Magyars lost the throne,
it was said that the wolves' reign was over.</i>

43:32.046 --> 43:34.883
<i>How'd you know they were here?</i>

43:35.049 --> 43:37.677
<i>l thought you'd like to see them.</i>

43:38.428 --> 43:40.972
<i>You're full of secrets, aren't you?</i>

43:41.347 --> 43:44.559
<i>Don't you want to draw them or something?</i>

43:45.393 --> 43:49.355
<i>Whenever l'm with you
l get the feeling you're hiding.</i>

43:52.442 --> 43:56.279
My family has plans for me.

43:57.321 --> 44:01.576
<i>Expectations. Where l go, who l'm with.</i>

44:03.786 --> 44:06.748
<i>But your future is your own, isn't it?</i>

44:16.299 --> 44:18.885
Let me tell you something.

44:22.638 --> 44:26.976
My old man was an ex-Army Ranger
and an addict.

44:27.059 --> 44:32.231
And he told me that l was gonna learn
to defend myself whether l wanted to or not.

44:32.982 --> 44:37.528
<i>Truth is, all l really wanted to do was draw,
but that wasn't exactly on the agenda.</i>

44:37.778 --> 44:43.409
So one day we had it out, you know.

44:43.492 --> 44:46.954
l was 1 7, said l was leaving, the whole thing.

44:47.079 --> 44:51.584
And he said he would kill me if l tried.

44:53.210 --> 44:55.546
And l tried.

44:56.672 --> 44:58.966
What happened?

45:00.718 --> 45:05.180
Turns out l knew how to defend myself
better than l thought.

45:06.223 --> 45:09.810
Which is why my name is not on my books.

45:10.644 --> 45:13.022
<i>lf he finds me, he'll follow through.</i>

45:13.063 --> 45:16.525
<i>There's an assault warrant out on me
in the States.</i>

45:17.151 --> 45:21.405
So now l write from wherever l travel,
send it in to my publisher.

45:22.364 --> 45:24.575
Since you were 1 7?

45:24.783 --> 45:27.202
But my point is,

45:27.953 --> 45:31.999
l know what it feels like not to want
what they want for you.

45:33.375 --> 45:37.462
<i>But it's your life. You don't get another.</i>

45:38.130 --> 45:43.760
<i>And in any other, l wouldn't be here.</i>

46:14.541 --> 46:17.002
So am l going to see you again?

46:17.210 --> 46:18.837
-No.
-Never?

46:18.920 --> 46:23.883
-Ever.
-So l guess this is goodbye then.

46:38.731 --> 46:42.485
<i>Your family don't have to know.
lf that's the way you want it.</i>

46:46.072 --> 46:48.241
<i>lt's the way you should want it, too.</i>

48:01.230 --> 48:04.024
<i>So what's your train ticket say?</i>

48:04.066 --> 48:06.110
<i>l'm mean, what's the date on it?</i>

48:06.193 --> 48:10.990
<i>l tore it up. l'm inspired now.
l'm starting over with the book.</i>

48:11.073 --> 48:13.200
All over?

48:13.242 --> 48:17.287
<i>lt's going to be about the Magyar princes
and Bucharest castle.</i>

48:17.371 --> 48:20.165
<i>Back in the loup-garou glory days,
when they ran the city.</i>

48:20.457 --> 48:22.751
And their rise and fall.

48:22.793 --> 48:24.753
Why do they have to fall?

48:24.795 --> 48:26.839
What? People who can turn themselves
into animals?

48:26.922 --> 48:29.258
How could we not be threatened by that?

48:30.175 --> 48:33.345
<i>Hey, if you don't want me to let them fall...</i>

48:51.154 --> 48:54.074
<i>-Hey, what's the matter?
-Nothing, l cut myself.</i>

48:54.157 --> 48:58.328
-You did? Let me see.
-No! l have to get home.

48:58.412 --> 49:01.832
<i>-You don't have to go home.
-Yes, she does.</i>

49:02.791 --> 49:04.459
Caution with my cousin, meat.

49:04.543 --> 49:07.629
Many men have courted her,
none have survived to tell the tale.

49:07.712 --> 49:09.005
Leave him alone, Rafe.

49:09.089 --> 49:11.591
<i>Some girls will steal your heart,
this bitch'll eat it.</i>

49:11.675 --> 49:13.176
Take your hands off her.

49:13.301 --> 49:15.220
<i>What? Didn't she tell you?</i>

49:15.303 --> 49:17.681
<i>She's promised to someone. A man.
An important man.</i>

49:17.722 --> 49:18.723
Leave him alone!

49:18.807 --> 49:21.059
The man who brought her home
after she got her parents killed.

49:21.142 --> 49:22.394
She told you that, right?

49:22.477 --> 49:25.021
That they were slaughtered
and it was her fault?

49:25.230 --> 49:26.731
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

49:26.815 --> 49:30.985
<i>She's taken, friend. She owes a man.</i>

49:31.778 --> 49:33.863
<i>She's not for you.</i>

49:37.909 --> 49:41.496
<i>He's a rare find, isn't he? Medium rare.</i>

49:41.579 --> 49:43.790
Go to hell.

49:43.915 --> 49:46.709
Yes, l probably will.

49:53.091 --> 49:55.176
<i>What's he talking about, ''taken''?</i>

49:55.260 --> 49:57.512
<i>We can't meet again.</i>

49:58.304 --> 50:02.475
We can do whatever we want.
What the hell is wrong, Vivian?

50:02.558 --> 50:04.435
l told you about my family from the start.

50:04.519 --> 50:08.064
The hell with your family, right?
What, do they own you?

50:07.647 --> 50:09.982
Are you gonna let them own you?

50:10.066 --> 50:12.944
<i>l won't let you be my fault.</i>

50:22.411 --> 50:26.165
They talk of secrets, our secrets.

50:26.791 --> 50:29.001
These four heard her themselves.

50:30.169 --> 50:32.213
ls she protecting the pack?

50:33.756 --> 50:34.966
Who is he?

50:35.049 --> 50:36.676
<i>He's meat.</i>

50:37.176 --> 50:39.261
American brand.

50:40.638 --> 50:44.225
<i>She talks to him of loup-garous, Gabriel.</i>

50:47.687 --> 50:49.814
Or is Vivian above our law?

50:52.316 --> 50:54.318
She has grown feelings for him?

51:03.410 --> 51:05.871
Then you will take care of that for me.

51:06.038 --> 51:08.123
-Me?
-Yes.

51:08.165 --> 51:10.209
<i>l'm sure you'll know what to do.</i>

51:10.292 --> 51:12.753
Bribe him, threaten him. Whatever it takes.

51:12.836 --> 51:15.547
He spends not one more night in this city.

51:16.048 --> 51:18.384
He stays, he dies.

52:08.809 --> 52:12.771
<i>''Forgive me.
I've so much to say and so little time.</i>

52:13.104 --> 52:18.193
<i>''Meet me at Silestru Chapel
north of the city tonight at 6.:*00.</i>

52:19.402 --> 52:21.238
<i>''Vivian. ''</i>

53:12.747 --> 53:15.333
How is this for a resting place?

53:17.585 --> 53:20.630
lt was built in the 13th century,

53:20.713 --> 53:23.966
supposedly on soil brought
from the Holy Land.

53:24.092 --> 53:27.970
So many people wanted to be buried here
that the cemetery overflowed.

53:28.054 --> 53:29.847
So they improvised.

53:29.931 --> 53:31.307
<i>Where's Vivian?</i>

53:31.390 --> 53:35.728
<i>l like to think they're saying,
''Come on, it's not so bad.''</i>

53:36.103 --> 53:38.731
<i>l asked where's Vivian.</i>

53:38.773 --> 53:40.775
Not with you.

53:42.777 --> 53:47.073
<i>Little Vivian, she's like a wounded animal,
you see:*</i>

53:47.114 --> 53:49.116
<i>She's had her heart broken
one too many times.</i>

53:49.200 --> 53:51.410
<i>You're here to protect her?</i>

53:51.494 --> 53:56.540
<i>Merely from herself. So, when's your train?</i>

53:58.250 --> 54:02.630
<i>-What if l'm not on it?
-Then what's left of you will be.</i>

54:03.756 --> 54:06.592
<i>Unless, of course,
you'd rather be buried here, you know.</i>

54:06.634 --> 54:10.095
-As a ceiling fan or something.
-Why am l such a threat?

54:10.179 --> 54:11.263
<i>She's a fragile girl.</i>

54:11.305 --> 54:14.141
No, no, why am l such a threat to you?

54:17.186 --> 54:21.315
<i>Oh, no, my friend. You're not a threat.</i>

54:21.607 --> 54:23.817
This is a threat.

54:23.901 --> 54:26.028
<i>You'll leave Romania on the next train.</i>

54:26.111 --> 54:29.490
<i>You won't write to her, talk to her,
or come looking for her ever again.</i>

54:29.573 --> 54:32.368
Because if you so much as breathe
her name...

54:37.956 --> 54:40.125
Do you hear me breathing?

54:43.545 --> 54:46.840
<i>Yes, look! Look what you've done!</i>

54:47.549 --> 54:51.970
You stupid meat, l was here to save you,
to warn you.

54:52.221 --> 54:55.599
<i>But now, now you're mine.</i>

55:06.651 --> 55:09.529
Bless this food for our use
and us to thy service.

55:30.467 --> 55:34.721
<i>l'll take the train, l swear it.
l'm gone. l'm on that train.</i>

55:34.804 --> 55:37.265
l am the train.

56:45.166 --> 56:48.210
<i>Oh, my God, it's silver.</i>

58:14.921 --> 58:19.760
<i>So your playmate's home tonight.
You should come see me.</i>

58:19.843 --> 58:21.762
Not tonight, Astrid.

58:22.137 --> 58:24.306
These old laws, you can change them.

58:24.389 --> 58:27.767
Seven years, why seven?
Real wolves mate for life.

58:28.018 --> 58:30.061
Not another word.

58:31.980 --> 58:36.067
Come on. We used to set this place on fire.

58:38.778 --> 58:43.617
We all grow old, Astrid.
We have to do it with dignity.

59:10.518 --> 59:13.104
Aiden? What...

59:13.688 --> 59:17.567
Aiden, what happened?

59:17.692 --> 59:18.901
Your cousin.

59:19.027 --> 59:21.988
-Rafe? What are you...
-Stay back.

59:23.114 --> 59:25.575
Why do you know so much about wolves,
Vivian?

59:25.658 --> 59:27.869
What are you talking about?
How badly are you hurt?

59:27.910 --> 59:30.997
<i>ls it 'cause you knew he was one, huh?</i>

59:31.038 --> 59:35.126
<i>Loup-garou. Like the legend.
Like a comic book.</i>

59:37.128 --> 59:39.046
Where is he?

59:39.964 --> 59:41.549
Extinct.

59:50.850 --> 59:52.518
Take it.

59:56.439 --> 59:59.567
<i>Go on, take it. lt's silver.</i>

01:00:03.696 --> 01:00:08.075
-l wanted to protect you.
-Protect me from who? From you?

01:00:08.576 --> 01:00:10.161
<i>You're not possible.</i>

01:00:10.244 --> 01:00:13.247
Get out of town. Get out of Romania.
Get out and never come back.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:14.915
<i>lf they find you, they'll kill you.</i>

01:00:14.957 --> 01:00:16.167
<i>Oh, it's ''they'' now, huh?</i>

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.960
What did you want from me, the truth?

01:00:18.043 --> 01:00:20.504
Listen, my life is over. l just killed someone!

01:00:20.629 --> 01:00:24.592
<i>They're gonna find my prints, my blood.
What am l gonna tell them?</i>

01:00:25.134 --> 01:00:27.636
What will you tell them?

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.682
<i>lt's just too much to ask, l guess,
just a human girl.</i>

01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:34.476
<i>-Aiden, l never wanted...
-lt's too late for that.</i>

01:00:35.519 --> 01:00:40.607
<i>lf you cared a goddamn thing about me,
you would've left me before we ever met.</i>

01:00:50.492 --> 01:00:52.369
Aiden.

01:01:54.431 --> 01:01:56.683
May l help you, sir?

01:01:58.977 --> 01:02:02.313
Yes, as a matter of fact you can.

01:02:04.315 --> 01:02:06.776
Are these real silver?

01:02:06.943 --> 01:02:08.736
Of course.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.613
Thank you.

01:02:26.462 --> 01:02:28.881
We went to find him.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.638
<i>He'd been gone for so long.</i>

01:03:09.463 --> 01:03:11.841
What is it, Vivian?

01:03:12.925 --> 01:03:15.177
<i>His car's outside.</i>

01:03:35.364 --> 01:03:37.074
<i>What's happened?</i>

01:03:39.243 --> 01:03:41.036
Our son is dead.

01:03:59.471 --> 01:04:02.099
He will be avenged.

01:04:24.413 --> 01:04:26.039
Do you need some help?

01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:29.793
<i>No. No, thank you, Officers.
l'm just waiting for my train.</i>

01:04:30.085 --> 01:04:32.087
The correct answer is yes.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.166
My lords and ladies.

01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:16.089
Man has forced us to hide our true nature.

01:05:16.214 --> 01:05:18.967
He has persecuted us for centuries.

01:05:21.344 --> 01:05:24.472
Last night, he took yet another life.

01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:30.520
The life of my son.

01:05:34.023 --> 01:05:38.820
But we will have vengeance,
for his murderer is here.

01:05:44.659 --> 01:05:46.661
No!

01:05:47.078 --> 01:05:48.079
Him!

01:05:48.162 --> 01:05:49.163
Rafe went to kill him.

01:05:49.247 --> 01:05:53.543
This man knew our secret
because one of us let him get too near.

01:05:53.626 --> 01:05:55.711
And how would you know that?

01:05:57.213 --> 01:05:59.924
Did Rafe hunt him down on his own,
or did you send him?

01:06:00.007 --> 01:06:01.884
He killed my son.
He must pay with his blood.

01:06:01.926 --> 01:06:04.262
You sent your own son to his death
over me?

01:06:04.345 --> 01:06:06.555
Enough!

01:06:11.018 --> 01:06:14.438
lf he lives,
he will bring the hunters in the night.

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:19.235
Just like the ones who killed your parents.
And it will be all your fault again.

01:06:27.201 --> 01:06:29.578
<i>There's a river within those woods.</i>

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.665
lf you reach the other side,
you win your life.

01:06:34.041 --> 01:06:35.459
No.

01:06:37.962 --> 01:06:39.797
Wish your enemy well.

01:06:44.843 --> 01:06:46.720
Wish him well.

01:07:15.666 --> 01:07:17.334
Run.

01:08:08.802 --> 01:08:12.138
You say man is a heartless killer.
How are we any different?

01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:14.432
We only kill to survive.

01:08:15.433 --> 01:08:17.519
Take her to the car till l come back.

01:08:37.205 --> 01:08:39.540
<i>Stupid girl. You are loup-garou.</i>

01:10:39.117 --> 01:10:42.204
Creeks lead to rivers.

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.699
But l crossed the river.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.743
The river.

01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:31.580
What about your goddamn river, huh?

01:14:01.193 --> 01:14:04.070
Oh, Jesus, no.

01:14:13.163 --> 01:14:15.498
<i>l'm sorry, l...</i>

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.690
<i>Please don't kill me.</i>

01:14:56.873 --> 01:15:02.378
<i>Hold on, there's a road ahead.
We have to get you to a hospital.</i>

01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:05.673
No, hospitals only make it worse.

01:15:06.048 --> 01:15:07.800
Then where?

01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:11.554
<i>There's a place.</i>

01:15:57.683 --> 01:16:01.145
Vivian! You home, little girl?

01:16:06.066 --> 01:16:10.112
<i>They won't look for us here.
This is a film company.</i>

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.240
Do you know what makes
photographs work?

01:16:13.365 --> 01:16:15.325
Silver.

01:16:17.995 --> 01:16:22.916
<i>They say, even now,
it'll kill you to breathe it.</i>

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:24.668
Will it?

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:27.504
<i>lt's already in my bloodstream.</i>

01:16:28.005 --> 01:16:32.175
<i>Once it's in, it stays in, unless it's treated.</i>

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:34.595
Treated how?

01:16:34.678 --> 01:16:38.849
<i>There's an anti-serum for silver
called Antigen-AG.</i>

01:16:39.725 --> 01:16:42.269
l know where l can find some
but not until dark.

01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:45.981
Come on.

01:16:51.236 --> 01:16:53.155
Vivian!

01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:10.088
<i>You didn't leave.</i>

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:14.050
<i>l'm running out of people to trust.</i>

01:17:14.926 --> 01:17:17.262
<i>l've never killed anyone.</i>

01:17:17.846 --> 01:17:20.974
At the hunts. Please believe me.

01:17:21.224 --> 01:17:24.102
Why do you even go?

01:17:26.021 --> 01:17:30.608
<i>lt's not the hunt l live for. lt's the running.</i>

01:17:31.568 --> 01:17:34.237
The being free.

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:39.701
They were my tracks the hunters followed
back to our house.

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:43.580
<i>That doesn't make it your fault.</i>

01:17:43.663 --> 01:17:46.040
Men kill us. We kill men.

01:17:46.124 --> 01:17:50.712
<i>Because anything we're not
is a thing we're taught to fear.</i>

01:18:20.741 --> 01:18:25.871
<i>So is that fear you're feeling right now?
Or is that something else?</i>

01:18:28.958 --> 01:18:31.043
<i>lt's fear.</i>

01:18:32.336 --> 01:18:34.672
<i>Of what you'll do?</i>

01:18:39.552 --> 01:18:41.804
Of what you think of me.

01:19:00.531 --> 01:19:04.410
<i>When l draw you, loup-garou,</i>

01:19:05.661 --> 01:19:07.955
<i>l'd wish that you were real.</i>

01:19:09.832 --> 01:19:13.877
So what right do l have
to wish you away now?

01:19:19.717 --> 01:19:21.385
You can control it.

01:19:22.261 --> 01:19:24.054
l can control it.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.170
Where would she hide, l asked.

01:19:57.254 --> 01:19:59.339
Where else but where l told her not to?

01:19:59.423 --> 01:20:02.843
<i>-Don't, Astrid.
-He's not one of us.</i>

01:20:04.803 --> 01:20:08.223
<i>Astrid, don't. There is another way.</i>

01:20:08.348 --> 01:20:14.062
lt was man who killed my sister.
lt was man who killed my son.

01:20:14.271 --> 01:20:16.940
lt was Gabriel that killed Rafe.

01:20:17.023 --> 01:20:21.945
<i>Just like he'll kill me.
lt's the only justice he knows.</i>

01:20:22.445 --> 01:20:25.865
<i>l'll protect you. l'll make him see.</i>

01:20:25.991 --> 01:20:29.786
<i>Just like you'll make him see
who he really belongs with?</i>

01:20:30.036 --> 01:20:33.665
Your first love all went wrong.

01:20:33.957 --> 01:20:36.960
<i>Please don't take mine from me.</i>

01:20:45.885 --> 01:20:48.555
ls that silver?

01:20:49.472 --> 01:20:51.849
<i>We're going to the pharmacist's.
We're getting antigen,</i>

01:20:51.933 --> 01:20:53.935
<i>and then we're leaving the city.</i>

01:20:56.062 --> 01:20:59.983
<i>He can't love you if he fears you.</i>

01:21:02.694 --> 01:21:05.613
Tell me not to fall in love, Astrid.

01:21:06.364 --> 01:21:09.534
Tell me how much more to life there is.

01:21:14.539 --> 01:21:19.460
Run, my little girl. Run free.

01:21:27.885 --> 01:21:29.679
Prescription.

01:21:36.102 --> 01:21:40.147
Hands on the counter.
Gabriel owns this guy.

01:21:42.942 --> 01:21:47.321
You must be in some kind hairy situation?

01:21:54.286 --> 01:21:57.790
Got some splinter in your paw?

01:22:00.835 --> 01:22:04.463
Like lemonade on a hot day.

01:22:22.648 --> 01:22:25.275
Stop! Drop the gun.

01:22:26.443 --> 01:22:30.447
Sorry, my furry friend. Drop the gun.

01:23:07.567 --> 01:23:09.194
Watch out!

01:23:15.742 --> 01:23:16.910
Run!

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:27.837
How many of us have to die
for your happiness?

01:23:28.588 --> 01:23:30.590
l can smell him on you.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:20.098
You try to run a simple business...

01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:26.187
My new best customer.

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:30.483
l want your antigen,
your bullets and your dust.

01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:57.968
How does it feel to be in a cage

01:24:58.094 --> 01:25:00.429
the way man would have you?

01:25:01.889 --> 01:25:05.059
You could have been
a great inspiration to your people.

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:10.356
But look at you now. Our greatest shame.

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:17.571
When you put your trust in man,
you condemn us all.

01:25:17.655 --> 01:25:19.156
We condemn ourselves.

01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:36.298
<i>Aren't we half-human?</i>

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:39.676
<i>Don't you see that what you denounce
is a part of you?</i>

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:45.724
<i>lt's not part of me. lt's part of you.</i>

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.976
l know what l am.

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:54.983
You and your traditions can go to hell.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.613
Well, you are the future of this pack.

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:02.658
<i>l'll let you name her fate.</i>

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:26.806
What have you ever loved, Gabriel?

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:31.603
<i>Power, hate, fear?
You're the most human of us all.</i>

01:26:31.937 --> 01:26:33.271
You never understood.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:35.899
The ancient prophecy said a girl
from the bloodline of leaders

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.692
would one day command us

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.487
and lead us into a new age
of hope and glory.

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.156
l thought that girl was you.

01:26:43.239 --> 01:26:46.076
And what will the new age of hope
look like?

01:26:46.117 --> 01:26:48.078
How much blood will there be?

01:26:48.119 --> 01:26:49.746
<i>Let's find out tonight.</i>

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:52.749
We hunt, you and l.

01:27:06.846 --> 01:27:09.223
<i>Quick, he's there!</i>

01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.563
Drink up.

01:29:27.611 --> 01:29:32.407
For you and all mankind.

01:29:39.789 --> 01:29:43.084
You want to shoot your own family?

01:29:46.296 --> 01:29:49.924
You want to be that hunter
on that snowy night?

01:29:52.093 --> 01:29:54.888
Then l give you my back.

01:29:55.305 --> 01:29:57.932
<i>That's all you deserve.</i>

01:30:13.698 --> 01:30:15.283

01:30:16.868 --> 01:30:18.453
<i>l can't.</i>

01:30:20.621 --> 01:30:22.290
Shoot him.

if they're watching everywhere?</i>

01:31:54.006 --> 01:31:56.133
<i>There's one place they won't be.</i>

01:32:17.988 --> 01:32:22.701
<i>This is my world. These are my people.</i>

<i>They believe in prophecies and destinies.</i>

01:32:29.416 --> 01:32:31.543
<i>I believe we make our own.</i>

01:32:35.755 --> 01:32:37.591
Where are we headed?

01:32:38.091 --> 01:32:40.135
