-What?
-After my arrest,

00:15.754 --> 00:19.019
my entire life disappeared.

00:19.062 --> 00:21.238
Colleagues, your mother.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.501
Oh, everyone's your best friend
until they find out

00:23.545 --> 00:25.329
you're a serial killer.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.288
Then, poof.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.854
I mean, this cancel culture has

00:28.898 --> 00:30.508
just gotten
a little out of hand.

00:30.552 --> 00:34.295
Then they brought me here.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.949
With nothing.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.474
But you...

00:39.517 --> 00:40.779
you came to me.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.739
And you kept coming back.

00:43.782 --> 00:47.482
Even though you
probably shouldn't.

00:47.525 --> 00:50.093
But I'm your father.

00:50.137 --> 00:53.053
And you're my little boomerang.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.883
I'm just confused.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.146
Lost.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.756
Scared.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.193
You have no idea what
these visits do to me.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.282
What you did to me.

01:05.326 --> 01:08.416
My boy...

01:08.459 --> 01:10.113
I made you.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.553
You destroyed me.

01:15.597 --> 01:16.946
Malcolm, what are you doing?

01:18.034 --> 01:20.602
I came to tell you,
face to face.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.995
-Tell me what?
-That you're a crazy old man.

01:23.039 --> 01:26.173
A sick lunatic
living in a delusion.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.217
We never had a relationship.

01:27.261 --> 01:30.742
Because none of this is real.

01:30.786 --> 01:34.877
I never loved you
and you'll never see me again!

Morning, Mr. David.

01:42.841 --> 01:44.930
MR. DAVID:
It certainly is for you.

01:44.974 --> 01:47.803
The cardiologists were able to
stabilize Prime Minister Zandun.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.413
He's recovering
with a good prognosis,

01:49.457 --> 01:51.154
thanks to your consultation.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.765
The administration wanted
to show their appreciation.

01:53.809 --> 01:56.551
Oh, the echocardiogram
does all the heavy lifting.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.814
I just shared my thoughts.

Are all of my privileges

02:00.816 --> 02:02.948
being reinstated?

02:02.992 --> 02:05.516
Well, I have no idea, Martin.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.127
Well, I have to admit...

02:07.170 --> 02:10.173
I have felt a little
isolated lately.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.957
Though, I suppose that's

02:12.001 --> 02:14.177
rather the point
of solitary confinement.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.439
[chuckles]

02:15.483 --> 02:19.182
Haven't spoken
to my boy in weeks.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.663
I miss the little guy.

you are finally

Do I?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.537
For an island vacation?

03:53.581 --> 03:55.278
Definitely.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.976
Oh. I swear, the last time
I had to fly commercial,

03:58.020 --> 04:00.283
I felt like I was on
the last chopper out of Saigon.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.893
Yes.

Oh, joke all you want,

04:05.941 --> 04:07.682

04:07.725 --> 04:09.727
You have been consumed

04:09.771 --> 04:11.599

I'll admit, I've been...

04:22.000 --> 04:23.959

but I'd be perfectly fine

04:24.002 --> 04:25.787

here in New York.

04:25.830 --> 04:28.268
Oh, no.
Wrong island, dear.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.095
You are gonna be
sipping daiquiris

04:30.139 --> 04:32.663
and listening to the waves
and sleeping in a hammock.

04:32.707 --> 04:33.925
Restrained, of course.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.579
Now, come on,

04:35.623 --> 04:38.016
No, my flight's not for hours,

04:38.060 --> 04:39.540
Oh, no.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.151
I have arranged
something far better.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.334
My mother called in
a police escort?

04:51.378 --> 04:53.597
Kid, I'd drive you all

I'm deploying to a war zone?

Our vic's name is Jules Connor.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.774
Former district attorney.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.524
Hmm.
Based on the murder weapon,

06:34.568 --> 06:36.439
he had a flair for the dramatic.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.962
Double-barrel flintlock pistol.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.877
Walnut handle, gold filigree.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.444

To poach ivory in the Serengeti.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.028
Sorry, I had to do it.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.899
Comedy comes in threes.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.989
But you can't leave
until you see this.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.824
Hmm.

07:13.868 --> 07:18.046
Villefort is a central character
in The Count of Monte Cristo.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.352
One of my favorite books
growing up.

07:20.396 --> 07:23.443
"I let him place the box
in the hole he had made,

07:23.486 --> 07:26.141
"then, whilst he stamped
with his feet

07:26.184 --> 07:28.360
"to remove all traces
of his handiwork,

07:28.404 --> 07:31.363
"I rushed on him and plunged
my knife into his breast,

"exclaiming,
'I am Giovanni Bertuccio;

"'thy death for my brother's;

07:35.890 --> 07:37.848
thy treasure for his widow.'"

07:37.892 --> 07:41.939
In the story, the Count's life
is destroyed by three men--

07:41.983 --> 07:44.159
Villefort, Danglars and Fernand.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.466
And he enacts
his vengeance on them all.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.729
We may be looking
for a revenge killer

07:48.772 --> 07:51.601

for poetic justice.

And if your profile's right,

07:52.994 --> 07:54.169
then two more bodies
are gonna drop.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.779
We're not gonna let that happen.

07:55.823 --> 07:59.000

Come on.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.328
What the hell is a black widow?

08:23.372 --> 08:25.156
A Russian anti-personnel mine.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.244
Been around since the '50s.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.553
Keep that thing steady, bro.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.686
The only thing keeping
this place from blowing

08:32.729 --> 08:34.905
is a weak creep spring
on the pressure plate.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.517
Oh, good thing
I don't have a hand tremor.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.170
You're making jokes?

08:39.214 --> 08:40.607
There's no reason
for you to stay here.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.522
I can handle this
until the bomb squad gets here.

I need to speak quickly.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.191
Uh, JT, auction houses will have
records of the gun's sale.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.803
Gil, the killer
identifies as the Count,

09:02.846 --> 09:04.369
which means that the victim
would have deemed him

09:04.413 --> 09:06.328
inferior or unworthy
in some way.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.851
And Dani?

09:07.895 --> 09:10.767
Yeah?

Yeah, just...

inspired killer

09:46.760 --> 09:47.891

09:47.935 --> 09:49.414
Wow.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.547
Was the first victim Villefort? Or...

09:51.591 --> 09:54.811
W... uh, wait, you're-you're
holding a live mine?

09:54.855 --> 09:56.900
Yeah, everyone cleared out.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.293
It's just me.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.208
Thinking of a really bad plan

10:00.251 --> 10:02.471

10:02.514 --> 10:04.647
And you picked up?

10:04.691 --> 10:05.909
Why?

Today, we welcome back

11:15.065 --> 11:18.155
Martin, how are you feeling
about your solitary confinement?

11:18.199 --> 11:20.984
Well, first of all, uh,
it's great to be back.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.291
Um, I have to tell you, Stanley,

11:23.334 --> 11:25.989
I was in a pretty bad place.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.078
I thought my son was dead.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.776
[screaming]

11:31.299 --> 11:33.997
Got a little dark there
for a minute. [chuckles]

11:34.041 --> 11:36.957
But, uh, I have come to learn

11:37.000 --> 11:38.262
my boy is just fine.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.177
I was even able
to help him deal with

11:40.221 --> 11:42.571
something explosive
at his work today.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.661
-That's positive.
-But I worry about him.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.924
He's not okay.

11:47.968 --> 11:51.362
And I'm not sure I have the, uh,

11:51.406 --> 11:53.364
the emotional tools

11:53.408 --> 11:54.931
to help.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.542
Perhaps we could do some, uh,
therapeutic role-playing,

11:57.586 --> 11:59.283
you know, to help me
with my, uh,

11:59.327 --> 12:01.242

12:02.722 --> 12:04.071
All right, Martin.

12:04.114 --> 12:08.118
-Let's see who...
-And Hector could play Malcolm.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.210
[sighs] I don't want to.
I'm always Malcolm.

12:13.254 --> 12:16.997

...I'm a changed man.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.153
No, I know you have
some questions,

12:43.197 --> 12:46.026
and I haven't always been
forthcoming,

12:46.069 --> 12:49.072

Come on, it's important.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.156

I love you, too.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.755
Stop.
Right now.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.412
Bright, talk to me about
The Count of Monte Cristo.

14:08.456 --> 14:11.154
Well, the story begins

14:11.198 --> 14:13.461
on the 24th of February, 1815

14:13.504 --> 14:16.159
in Marseilles,
when a three-masted ship

14:16.203 --> 14:18.509
-named the Pharaon...
-Kid.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.862
The Count was in prison
for 14 years

14:22.905 --> 14:25.386
because he was wronged
by three men.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.518
Our killer identifies with that.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.173
To him, this wasn't murder.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.523
Connor was executed for a crime.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.310
His original sin.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.355
Lieutenant Arroyo,

14:38.399 --> 14:40.923
there's a Inspector Boville
on the line.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.578
-Who?
-It's my father.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.580
Boville was the detective

14:45.623 --> 14:47.712
in The Count of Monte Cristo.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.845
He must have
figured something out.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.894
He called me at the crime scene

14:54.937 --> 14:57.940
-when I was alone with the mine.
-Why'd you pick up?

14:57.984 --> 15:01.335
I was in a weird place.
I'll talk to him myself.

15:01.378 --> 15:04.729
No.
Put him through.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.950
-The hell you just say?
-Excuse me?

15:07.994 --> 15:10.735
You're gonna talk to your dad,
we do it together as a team.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.607
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.392
Nope.

15:17.264 --> 15:20.223
Dr. Whitly,
you're on with me and...

15:20.267 --> 15:22.051
the rest of the team.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.227
Really?

15:24.271 --> 15:26.360
The gang's all there?

15:26.403 --> 15:28.101
I hope you're calling
about the case.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.406
Well, yes.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.495
I've been thinking
about your body.

15:31.539 --> 15:32.975
You know, Villefort was

15:33.019 --> 15:35.543
procureur du roi--

15:35.586 --> 15:37.240
-"prosecutor to the king."
-Our victim was

15:37.284 --> 15:39.242
a former D.A.
He could be responsible

15:39.286 --> 15:40.940
for sentencing our killer
to prison.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.507
Mm, I don't think
it's so one-to-one, Malcolm.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.467
-You said there was a bomb.
-JT: Land mine.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.992
Ooh.
Who said that?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.776
Nobody.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.605
I don't think the bomb
was meant for our victim.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.781
I think it was meant
for all of you.

15:56.825 --> 15:59.784
You know, the police
do prosecute for the king.

15:59.828 --> 16:03.571
Maybe you should have joined
the family profession, Malcolm,

16:03.614 --> 16:05.399
by which I mean medicine.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.488
-Okay, we're done.
-H-Hold on.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.620
Could this be about something

16:09.664 --> 16:11.187
the police helped cover up
for Connor?

16:11.231 --> 16:12.972
Oh, that's good.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.930
Is that you, Gil?
Who else is there?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.584
Should we do
quick introductions?

16:16.627 --> 16:18.238
Dr. Whitly, if you don't have
anything else...

16:18.281 --> 16:21.502
Now, I would like to discuss
the cause of death.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.418
He used a flintlock pistol.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.550
An antique.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.552
Oh, how romantic.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.685
And intricate.
You know, uh,

16:30.728 --> 16:32.556
it takes a lot of time
and investment

16:32.600 --> 16:35.298
to load and fire.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.300
Our killer wasn't in a rush.

16:37.344 --> 16:40.086
He savored all of this,
every detail.

16:40.129 --> 16:43.089
Which is why they may run
the risk of being overly myopic,

16:43.132 --> 16:46.527
you know, that they may, uh,
focus too much on the details

16:46.570 --> 16:50.096
and miss something
in the overall gestalt.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.619
That's how we're
gonna catch him.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.621
I got a hit on the gun.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.579
The pistol was purchased
at an auction

16:55.623 --> 16:57.059
last year by William Voight.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.322
He's a money manager
to the one-percenters.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.194
Oh, there's a lady cop?

17:01.237 --> 17:03.022
Oh, how wonderf...

17:04.632 --> 17:07.635
-Your dad seems nice.
-[short chuckle]

17:07.678 --> 17:09.724
-He's not.
-Mm.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.639
Why would a guy like
William Voight kill Connor?

17:12.509 --> 17:14.816
Let's find out.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.255

17:22.128 --> 17:23.912
You'll look beautiful in either.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.523
Oh, I don't need empty flattery,
I need an actual opinion.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.221
And flattery.

17:28.264 --> 17:31.615
It's not every day one scores
an invite to a Taylor wedding.

17:31.659 --> 17:33.400
They're practically
American royalty.

17:33.443 --> 17:36.098
I know. Well, the network
actually asked me to cover it.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.926
Cal Taylor, war hero,

17:37.969 --> 17:40.146

17:43.062 --> 17:44.628
I'm so proud of you.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.804
Oh, I know this assignment

17:46.848 --> 17:48.632
isn't really that
big a deal, but...

17:48.676 --> 17:51.287
It may not be a big deal
for you, but I was exiled

17:51.331 --> 17:54.073
to social Siberia
after your father's arrest.

17:54.116 --> 17:57.467
It's taken me 20 years
to get back.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.341
Yes, my invitation

18:01.384 --> 18:02.864
may have been late and, yes,

plunging at our key witness?

of falling sword death?

That's us.
Besides,

Okay, William,

20:19.653 --> 20:21.045
while we're here,

20:21.089 --> 20:23.526
do you have any idea
who would do this to you?

20:23.570 --> 20:25.441
No, I-I didn't see his face.

20:25.485 --> 20:29.097
He must have drugged me, and
then I-I-I woke up like this.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.838
DANI:
Bright, cutting now.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.930
You know, your antique pistol

20:35.973 --> 20:37.932
was recently used in a homicide.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.934
Yeah, Connor.
Look, yeah, it wasn't my gun.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.849
I acquired it
for one of my clients,

20:41.892 --> 20:43.372
uh, for a collection,

20:43.416 --> 20:45.244
and I-I think

20:45.287 --> 20:47.681
these might be his swords, but
it-it wasn't him who did this.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.073
DANI:
Got another one.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.860
-Oh, God!
-Ooh!

20:52.903 --> 20:55.254
Who's the client?
Because right now,

20:55.297 --> 20:57.865
-they look pretty guilty.
-You know I can't tell you that.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.301
Is he connected to Connor?

20:59.345 --> 21:01.695
Come on, William,
tell me before it's too late.

21:01.738 --> 21:02.957
Bright, you can't threaten him.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.264
I'm not threatening him,

21:05.307 --> 21:06.874
just being pragmatic.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.964
-This is scary stuff.
-JT: Cutting the next line.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.274
Another one.

21:16.449 --> 21:17.798
Oh, God! Aah!

21:17.841 --> 21:20.279
Calvin Taylor!

21:21.889 --> 21:23.804
Your client was theCal Taylor?

21:23.847 --> 21:26.110
-Yeah.
-There are only two left,

21:26.154 --> 21:28.417
and they're tethered to him.
We're coming down.

21:28.461 --> 21:31.638
Like a deadly 7-10 split.

21:32.465 --> 21:33.683
The Taylors.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.337
A few years ago,

21:35.381 --> 21:37.948
-the boat crash.
-GIL: I remember the story.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.647
Official report was that
a cook's daughter stole a boat

21:40.690 --> 21:43.519
and crashed it,
drowned in the sea.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.608
It always stank of a cover-up.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.784
Couldn't we talk
about this later?

21:47.828 --> 21:50.004
Hopefully.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.441
You cut,

21:52.485 --> 21:54.835
I'll catch.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.414
DANI:
Okay, here it comes.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.333
[shouts]

22:19.686 --> 22:21.122
So...

22:21.165 --> 22:23.777
is now a good time to talk?

22:29.826 --> 22:31.785
Connor and I worked
for the Taylors.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.047
We handled the whole
Isabella situation.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.875
Which situation, exactly?

22:34.918 --> 22:36.398
Well, she was
the cook's daughter.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.879
She didn't steal the boat,
she wasn't alone.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.795
Cal Taylor was with her.
They were an item.

22:41.838 --> 22:45.407
He was drunk and high...
[grunting]

22:45.451 --> 22:47.191
and she was underage.

22:47.235 --> 22:50.369
Not the type of details
you want spilled on Page Six.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.848
Exactly.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.981
After the crash,
Cal was able to swim to shore,

22:54.024 --> 22:56.636
but Isabella wasn't so lucky.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.464
But you covered all that up.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.554
Connor handled the police

23:01.597 --> 23:03.686
and I moved the money.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.253
-Isn't it Cal's wedding tonight?
-Yep.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.994
Tally and I are
doing a whole thing.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.778
Watching it live.
She's gonna wear a hat.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.476
[chuckles softly]

23:10.519 --> 23:14.523
When we spoke to my father,
he called the killings romantic.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.307
I think our Count would agree.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.309
He's gonna kill Cal
at his own wedding.

23:18.353 --> 23:19.963
DANI:
Well, if it's about
the accident,

23:20.007 --> 23:21.878
then it's got to be somebody
close to Isabella.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.359
What happened to the cook?
Her father.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.928
We sent him back to Ecuador.

23:29.712 --> 23:33.020
You and JT run down her family.
Bright and I will talk to Cal.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.239
You should call your lawyer.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.111
We're not done.

23:44.901 --> 23:48.252
Dani got a hit
on Isabella's father Ernesto.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.733
He reentered the country
five days ago.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.953
Not a coincidence.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.484
Hi.
Just a moment.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.399
[phone vibrates]

24:07.968 --> 24:09.360
Mother.
I'm...

24:09.404 --> 24:13.364
On vacation, I know.
I tracked your flight.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.583
How is the beach?

24:14.627 --> 24:16.063
Oh.
Fantastic.

24:16.106 --> 24:17.891
I'm really enjoying myself.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.501
Oh, that's wonderful.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.461
I can just hear it in your
voice. You're having fun.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.506
Yes, well, I'm...

24:24.550 --> 24:27.161
doing what I love.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.729
Mother, I, uh,
I have to jump off.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.470
I-I think I see
a conga line forming.

24:31.513 --> 24:32.906
[hangs up]

24:32.949 --> 24:35.865
I don't understand.
This fit two weeks ago.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.912
Cal?

24:38.955 --> 24:41.262
I'm Lieutenant Arroyo.
This is Malcolm Bright.

24:41.305 --> 24:42.916
We need to ask you
some questions.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.308
About Isabella.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.661
Love the crossbow.

24:48.704 --> 24:50.663
Do you shoot?

24:50.706 --> 24:52.795
No, I, uh...

24:52.839 --> 24:54.493
Who are you?

24:54.536 --> 24:56.103
MAN:
Hey, Cal,

24:56.146 --> 24:58.322
can you give us a second?

24:59.323 --> 25:00.499
[clears throat]

25:00.542 --> 25:02.326
BRIGHT:
Mr. Taylor, we need to speak

25:02.370 --> 25:04.415
-with your son.
-GEORGE: Can it wait?

25:04.459 --> 25:07.418
-The kid's all nerves.
-It can't.

25:07.462 --> 25:09.420
We're concerned someone
may be targeting him,

25:09.464 --> 25:11.422
using a weapon
from your own collection.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.381
Yes, my attorney called.

25:13.424 --> 25:16.253
Those were stolen
from a warehouse at The Met.

25:16.297 --> 25:19.909
Unfortunate,
but Cal is safe here.

25:21.302 --> 25:24.435
Do you remember Ernesto Cora?
He worked for you.

25:24.479 --> 25:28.091
Gentleman, really, this is
neither the time nor the place.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.745
-Will you please...
-Ten years ago

25:29.789 --> 25:32.574
your son killed Isabella Cora
and covered it up.

25:32.618 --> 25:35.708
Now a killer is back
for poetic justice.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.537
My son was not on that boat.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.148
You're protecting Cal.
Makes sense.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.411
It's what any father
would do for their son.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.851
GIL:
Mr. Taylor, two men have
already been attacked.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.853
One killed.
Cal's in danger.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.551
GEORGE:
Lieutenant, you're standing

25:52.594 --> 25:54.204
in the Taylor Estate.

25:54.248 --> 25:56.946
Built at the time of Fort Knox,
with security to match.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.513
My family is safe.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.603
This really is a stunning home.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.954
Your family fortune came
from bootlegging, right?

26:04.998 --> 26:07.522
Running whiskey from Canada.

26:10.438 --> 26:13.267
Your commissioner
will be here tonight,

26:13.310 --> 26:16.662
but I'm sure he could
swing by earlier if need be.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.925
Ernesto worked here for years.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.362
He knew this place
inside and out.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.407
But bootleggers
rarely use the front door.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.584
You said you had security
at every entrance.

26:25.627 --> 26:28.717
But what about the entrances
security doesn't know about?

26:28.761 --> 26:31.633
He said the tunnel
leads out over there.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.722
The only other access point
is a mile away.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.985
I'll sweep the east end.

26:39.902 --> 26:42.209
BRIGHT:
Gil. Found something.

26:52.436 --> 26:53.568
Hello?

26:55.657 --> 26:58.573
The wedding committee
are taking orders for dinner.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.620
I've got the menu.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.666
They're thinking Ecuadorian.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.557
Ernesto?

27:26.601 --> 27:28.734
Don't move.

27:42.008 --> 27:44.097
Ernesto, stop.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.534
Ernesto!

27:51.104 --> 27:53.062
Hands where I can see them.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.109
Huh.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.241
Look at that.

28:06.293 --> 28:10.123
Ernesto hasn't confessed yet,
but he will.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.733
Thank you for your help.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.517
No problem.

28:13.561 --> 28:14.954
But he definitely did it, right?

28:14.997 --> 28:16.738
Yes, and we got him.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.697
I don't understand it.
What was his plan?

28:18.740 --> 28:20.307
And what drove him
to these lengths? It...

28:20.350 --> 28:22.309
[laughs]:
Doesn't fit your profile?

28:22.352 --> 28:24.311
We got this. Come on,
Bright, you promised.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.487
I pulled a string, I got you
on the next flight out.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.532
Powell will give you a ride.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.970
-Gil, I'm...
-No, Bright, you're not.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.972
All right?
I can handle this case.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.235
I need you to handle you.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.413
DANI:
You don't look like someone

28:39.456 --> 28:41.197
thinking about
taking a vacation.

28:41.241 --> 28:43.460
I don't like Ernesto for this.

28:43.504 --> 28:46.159
Wow, you just can't
take a break, can you?

28:54.863 --> 28:56.909
It's not that.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.475
Isn't it?

28:58.519 --> 29:00.086
I think it's time that you had

29:00.129 --> 29:02.523
the profile turned
on you for once.

29:02.566 --> 29:05.047
Why can't you just
tune it all out?

29:05.091 --> 29:06.701
Walk away from it?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.444
What are you so afraid of?

29:14.013 --> 29:16.232
I'm afraid of me.

29:16.276 --> 29:19.583
The more relaxed
things are out there,

29:19.627 --> 29:22.848
the more time I have
to think in here.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.284
And when that happens...

29:24.327 --> 29:26.590
-It's terrifying.
-Yeah. Imagine a theater

29:26.634 --> 29:29.550
that only plays horror films...

29:29.593 --> 29:31.595
about you.

29:34.076 --> 29:36.644
That is...

29:36.687 --> 29:38.559
the worst idea for a movie
theater I have ever heard.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.779
I don't think anybody would go.

29:42.084 --> 29:45.174
Right?

29:45.218 --> 29:47.350
But the problem is...

29:47.394 --> 29:49.178
I'm trapped inside.

29:53.356 --> 29:56.316
All right, so,
where are we really going?

29:59.841 --> 30:02.496
I have a terrible idea.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.162
Malcolm.

30:16.205 --> 30:19.034
Oh, what a wonderful surprise.

30:19.078 --> 30:22.690
And you brought company.
Oh, delightful.

30:22.733 --> 30:24.823
I'm Martin.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.303
What has he told you about me?

30:27.347 --> 30:29.784
All good, I hope.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.927
Dr. Whitly, this is
Detective Powell of the NYPD.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.363
Ah. A friend?

30:43.406 --> 30:44.886
-Partner.
-Ah. Well.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.409
Whatever you kids
are calling it these days.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.847
Have a seat.
Uh, how are you?

30:48.890 --> 30:50.500
I heard you met John.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.676
JOHN:
We brought you
on that camping trip

30:52.720 --> 30:54.983
to take care of you for good.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.767
I was...

30:57.812 --> 30:58.944
...worried about you.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.684
After he kidnapped me,

31:00.728 --> 31:02.469
John Watkins told me
about the camping trip.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.123
You took me there

31:04.166 --> 31:06.299
because I found
the girl in the box.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.866
[short chuckle]

31:07.909 --> 31:10.259
John always had
an active imagination.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.391
[whispers]:
What are you doing?

31:11.434 --> 31:12.609
You were going to kill me.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.350
MARTIN:
Malcolm. [chuckles]

31:14.394 --> 31:17.179
I have done...

31:17.223 --> 31:18.354
bad things.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.835
But I never did that.

31:21.923 --> 31:25.405
I mean, if I wanted
to kill you...

31:26.275 --> 31:27.755
...I would have.

31:29.626 --> 31:31.715
We're here to solve a case.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.589
Let's do that.

31:41.769 --> 31:45.033
We arrested a suspect.
A good one.

31:45.077 --> 31:47.209
Ticks all the boxes.

31:47.253 --> 31:48.819
But something
doesn't feel right.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.821
All right.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.475
Tell me everything.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.216
JT:
They called Isabella a thief.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.218
Said she was high.
It's a good thing

31:56.262 --> 31:57.524
she didn't hurt anyone else.

31:57.567 --> 32:00.048
My daughter was a genius.

32:00.092 --> 32:03.051
She could have been
an engineer or an architect.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.053
Instead...

32:05.097 --> 32:07.447
She drowned.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.928
And when you started
asking questions,

32:09.971 --> 32:11.190
they fired you.

32:11.233 --> 32:13.235
-Ruined your family.
-Connor.

32:13.279 --> 32:14.933
Voight.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.936
They're the real criminals,
working for the Taylors.

32:17.979 --> 32:20.503
Those men are devils.
All of them.

32:20.547 --> 32:23.115
-But I didn't kill anyone.
-Then who did?

32:23.158 --> 32:25.465
And why the hell
did you come back?

32:25.508 --> 32:27.423
[sighs]
I-I got to say,

32:27.467 --> 32:29.164
I don't like Ernesto
for this, either.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.731
We're agreed on that.

32:30.774 --> 32:33.212
Why? He has all the indicators
of suspicion.

32:33.255 --> 32:34.604
Means, motive, opportunity.

32:34.648 --> 32:36.084
Oh, but where
are the intangibles?

32:36.128 --> 32:39.044
The passion, the finesse.
The joie de vivre.

32:39.087 --> 32:42.090
Killing people is not easy,
believe you me.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.397
You're right.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.138
Where's the drama in this story?

32:46.181 --> 32:48.618
Well, I'll tell you.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.055
Between father and son.

32:50.098 --> 32:53.493
George Taylor always
wanted his son to live,

32:53.536 --> 32:56.496
uh, a certain life,
even if Cal didn't agree.

32:56.539 --> 33:00.326
[whispers]:
And according to Page Six,

33:00.369 --> 33:02.763
Cal has felt trapped
by his family for years.

33:02.806 --> 33:05.635
If George is forcing Cal
into a life he doesn't want--

33:05.679 --> 33:08.943
marriage without love--
that could cause anyone to snap.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.597
So you think Cal's
gonna kill his father.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.643
Well, I mean,
I could be projecting.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.255
But he certainly has motive.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.821
Add to that
a classical education,

33:17.865 --> 33:20.302
enough time in the Army
to learn about land mines.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.000
He could be showing off
for his father.

33:22.043 --> 33:25.090
An almost narcissistic display
of premeditation.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.743
Which means his final
act of justice will be delivered

33:26.787 --> 33:28.484
in the most public way possible.

33:28.528 --> 33:30.704
The wedding. We have to stop Cal
before he kills his dad.

33:30.747 --> 33:33.663
"'Fernand!' Monte Cristo cried.
'Of my hundred names,

33:33.707 --> 33:35.448
I shall need only tell you one
to strike you...'"

Wait, uh, y-you can take her
shopping, my boy, on me.

33:51.551 --> 33:54.162
Gil, I need you to
go back in with Ernesto.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.772
-Are you...
-On the plane?

33:55.816 --> 33:56.556
No.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.253
Kid, you're done.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.689
I can explain.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.039
Dani and I went
to see my father.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.389
I think George Taylor
is in danger,

34:03.432 --> 34:05.260
and Cal may be our killer.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.436
The commissioner has a ton
of cops working that event.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.917
Even if your hunch is right,
they're not shutting it down.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.486
Ton of cops.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.140
You know anyone
who could let us in?

34:18.839 --> 34:20.058
I got a guy.

34:28.849 --> 34:30.416
Wow.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.983
You look... amazing.

gonna, like, uh,

34:53.047 --> 34:54.483
blow up and everything,

34:54.527 --> 34:56.398
what were you gonna say to me?

34:56.442 --> 34:57.660
Oh, just

34:57.704 --> 34:59.619
something about the profile.

34:59.662 --> 35:00.663
Nothing important.

35:06.147 --> 35:09.759
I knew you'd never join
a conga line.

35:18.899 --> 35:20.422
What the hell are you
doing here?

35:20.466 --> 35:21.858
Also, you look fabulous.

Oh, you, too.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.470
Do you really want to know
why we're here?

A case?

35:25.732 --> 35:29.562
God. Fine.
Just whatever you do,

35:29.605 --> 35:32.130
please don't embarrass me.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.219
We will do our best,
Mrs. Whitly.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.658
Bright, there's Cal.

35:41.313 --> 35:43.141
W... You can't be here.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.404
And yet here we are.
Do you have a second?

35:45.447 --> 35:47.319
I'm calling security.

35:47.362 --> 35:48.798
It's about Voight and Connor.

35:48.842 --> 35:52.541
Funny story.
Cal killed one of them.

in that department...

36:00.636 --> 36:02.072
Will you stop?

36:03.117 --> 36:04.205
Please.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.729
It...

36:06.773 --> 36:08.035
it was the worst night
of my life.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.603
Because you were driving
the boat.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.126
Yes, but...

36:13.606 --> 36:15.216
...I loved Isabella.

36:15.260 --> 36:18.219
After the explosion,
I-I looked for her everywhere.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.482
I ran up here to the house,
I called the Coast Guard,

36:20.526 --> 36:22.876
but... suddenly,
there was my dad.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.183
Cal, what did your father do?

36:28.273 --> 36:30.013
BRIGHT:
He did nothing.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.277
Because he never wanted you with
Isabella in the first place.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.889
I told my dad we could
still save Isabella.

36:37.107 --> 36:39.806
But he knew I was high.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.374
My dad said I had to
think about my future,

36:42.417 --> 36:44.898
my life.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.555
It was worth more than hers.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.731
She's always known that.

36:52.558 --> 36:53.907
What?

36:57.867 --> 37:00.870
Isabella grew up here,
in the world of aristocracy,

37:00.914 --> 37:03.656
but George Taylor never saw her
as anything more than a worker.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.135
He deemed her unworthy
of the family,

37:05.179 --> 37:06.702
of their storybook life.

37:06.746 --> 37:09.662
And then he tried
to erase her completely. But...

37:09.705 --> 37:13.143
the report says
they never recovered the body.

37:13.187 --> 37:14.797
What if she's alive?

37:14.841 --> 37:16.712
You're saying that our count
could be a countess?

37:16.756 --> 37:19.498
It fits.
That's why Ernesto came back--

37:19.541 --> 37:21.717
to stop his daughter.

37:28.855 --> 37:31.205
Cal.
When I was here this morning,

37:31.249 --> 37:33.773
there was a 1902 Colt pistol
in that case.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.731

37:43.348 --> 37:44.566
he was a serial killer.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.133
Are those canapés?

37:46.176 --> 37:47.917
Okay, so we definitely
found the bad guy,

37:47.961 --> 37:49.876
-and it is not the groom.
-George Taylor.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.486
He's the villain
in Isabella's story.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.096
And her final target.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.055
All these old families
got skeletons in the closet.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.405
Yeah.
Mine had 23.

37:57.449 --> 38:00.408
Uh, I forgot.
JT sent me this.

38:00.452 --> 38:03.281
-It's the last-known
photo of Isabella.
-Okay,

38:03.324 --> 38:04.847
and Cal said
there was an explosion

38:04.891 --> 38:06.980
when the boat crashed.
She could have burns.

38:07.023 --> 38:10.026
Now, imagine you're Isabella,

38:10.070 --> 38:12.246
waiting for the perfect moment
to get your revenge on George.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.466
-Which is?
-She'd want him on display,

-I'm gonna get that microphone.
-Okay.

38:30.351 --> 38:31.831
Yes, I think George would
like to say...

-Hey!
-Oh!
-Sorry.

gives his toast,

a few words about...

from way back here?
