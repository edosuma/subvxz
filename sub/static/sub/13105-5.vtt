00:02.670 --> 00:04.126
(Cher Lloyd)
* BOY YOU NEVER HAD MUCH GAME

00:04.170 --> 00:05.228
DOV?

00:05.270 --> 00:07.158
YOU'RE MALE, RIGHT?

00:07.200 --> 00:08.167
HUH?

00:08.200 --> 00:11.363
(Gail) YOU. MALE. AM I RIGHT?
YES, GAIL, I AM.

00:11.410 --> 00:13.435
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
IN GUY--

00:13.480 --> 00:15.607
YOU'RE SO... (laughs)
(Gail) EYE CONTACT
AND LAUGHING TOO HARD?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.403
'CAUSE I KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS IN GIRL.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.111
(Nick) OH, NOT SEALS.
THEY'RE...

00:19.150 --> 00:21.471
THEY'RE JUST UNWINDING
AFI'ER WORK, GAIL,

00:21.520 --> 00:23.044
LIKE COLLEAGUES DO.
COLLEAGUES.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.581
COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE
SPENT SIX MONTHS TOGETHER

00:25.620 --> 00:26.712
WORKING UNDERCOVER

00:26.760 --> 00:30.355
AND SHARING STORIES TOGETHER
AND COOKING WITH EACH OTHER?

00:30.390 --> 00:33.188
I-I THOUGHT YOU AND COLLINS
WERE ALL GOOD NOW.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.629
* AND EVERYWHERE WE WENT--
COME ON! *

00:34.660 --> 00:37.766
HE JUST LOOKED...
AT HER LIPS.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.358
HE LIP-LOOKED HER.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.834
NOPE. I'M STILL WAY BE'I'I'ER.

00:41.870 --> 00:44.236
(sets down glass)
EXCUSE ME.

00:44.270 --> 00:46.534
CHLOE.
HI.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.535
CAN I HAVE A WORD?

00:47.580 --> 00:49.400
I JUST SCORED A WHALE.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.644
WE'LL JUST BE A SEC.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.841
YEAH. JUST A SEC.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.575
HERE?

00:54.620 --> 00:56.781
* I WANT YOU BACK,
I WANT YOU BACK *

00:56.820 --> 00:59.152
* I WANT YOU,
WANT YOU BACK *

00:59.190 --> 01:01.078
YOU KNOW THAT GUY'S
A FIREMAN, RIGHT?

01:01.120 --> 01:02.553
SO?

01:02.590 --> 01:04.455
SO IN A ROOM FULL OF COPS,

01:04.490 --> 01:05.627
YOU'RE BASICALLY
TALKING TO A GUY

01:05.660 --> 01:07.696
WHO OPERATES A HOSE
FOR A LIVING.

01:07.730 --> 01:10.267
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, DOV?

01:10.300 --> 01:12.359
"RABID."

01:12.400 --> 01:13.662
RABBIT?

01:13.700 --> 01:16.362
"RABID." THE FILM.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.765
1977. CRONENBERG.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.300
THERE'S A SCREENING
IN THE PARK TOMORROW,

01:20.340 --> 01:22.171
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO WITH ME.

01:22.210 --> 01:25.600
I NEED TO BE REALLY CLEAR
ABOUT SOMETHING.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.312
'CAUSE A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING, I'M NOT GONNA LIE,

01:28.350 --> 01:29.840
15--
YES, I JUST--
I ASKED YOU OUT.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.108
WHAT ABOUT FRANK?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.582
I DON'T THINK
IT'S HIS KIND OF MOVIE.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.259
DOESN'T... WORRY YOU
ANYMORE?

01:36.290 --> 01:38.258
NO, IT DOES.

01:38.290 --> 01:40.224
BELIEVE ME, IT DOES,

01:40.260 --> 01:44.390
BUT I, UH, THINK...

01:44.430 --> 01:47.695
IT'S WORTH THE RISK.

01:47.740 --> 01:51.232
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

01:51.270 --> 01:52.703
* AND NOW YOU'RE DOING THEM
WITH HER *

01:52.740 --> 01:55.504
* REMEMBER ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU AND I DID FIRST? *

01:55.540 --> 01:57.644
IT'S ABOUT TIME,
DOV EPSTEIN.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.649
* BOY, YOU CAN SAY
ANYTHING YOU WANNA *

02:00.680 --> 02:02.910
* I WANT YOU BACK,
I WANT YOU BACK *

02:02.950 --> 02:04.781
* I WANT YOU BACK

02:04.820 --> 02:09.450
(siren wails in distance)

02:09.490 --> 02:11.287
GOOD MORNING.
HEY.

02:11.330 --> 02:12.524
WHAT IS THIS?

02:12.560 --> 02:13.788
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO OVERSTATE THIS,

02:13.830 --> 02:16.321
BUT THIS OMELET IS EASILY
THE GREATEST THING

02:16.370 --> 02:20.261
I HAVE EVER DONE
IN THE HISTORY OF... EVER.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.807
THAT'S SO SWEET.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.604
YOU SIT.
YOU WANT COFFEE?

02:25.640 --> 02:27.505
NICK...

02:27.540 --> 02:29.440
I DON'T EAT EGGS.
YOU DON'T?

02:29.480 --> 02:30.799
I HATE THEM.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.340
DO I KNOW THAT?

02:32.380 --> 02:33.711
YEP.

02:33.750 --> 02:37.288
AH.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.379
WHOOPS.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.217
UH, OKAY. OKAY.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.750
I TELL YOU WHAT--I'M GONNA
TAKE SOME OF THE TOPPINGS.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.189
I'M GONNA PUT IT ON TOAST.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.288
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

02:45.330 --> 02:46.490
NO, NO. NO, YOU'LL LOVE IT.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.293
I GRILL THE TOMATOES FIRST.
IT BRINGS OUT THE SWEETNESS...

02:48.330 --> 02:49.297
NICK?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.297
TOMATOES?

02:50.330 --> 02:51.888
WHAT, YOU DON'T EAT TOMATOES?

02:51.930 --> 02:53.261
I'M ALLERGIC.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.268
RIGHT.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.268
GIVES YOU THAT... RASH.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.299
OKAY.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.308
WELL, IF MY GOAL THIS MORNING
WAS TO GROSS YOU OUT

03:00.340 --> 03:02.774
AND THEN DISFIGURE YOU...
YOU ARE DOING SO GOOD.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.675
SORRY.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.769
I INVENTED
THIS RECIPE UNDERCOVER.

03:06.820 --> 03:07.946
I GOT KIND OF
USED TO MAKING IT.

03:07.980 --> 03:13.384
OH, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
WRAP IT UP AND BRING IT TO ANDY?

03:13.420 --> 03:15.388
I DON'T WANT IT
TO GO TO WASTE.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.751
(chair scrapes floor)

03:28.640 --> 03:32.007
HEY, TRACE,
TELL ME SOMETHING.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.576
WHAT WAS
YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION OF ME?

03:33.610 --> 03:34.975
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SWEET.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.307
COME ON.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.977
MAYBE
PATHOLOGICALLY AMBITIOUS,

03:38.010 --> 03:39.648
'CAUSE YOU KEPT SLEEPING
WITH YOUR SUPERIORS.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.241
(laughs) SO DID YOU, SO...
OKAY, THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.713
WE BECAME FRIENDS, RIGHT?

03:45.750 --> 03:46.819
UH-HUH.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.918
SO THERE'S NO REASON
WHY ME AND MARLO

03:47.960 --> 03:49.484
CAN'T BECOME FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW,

03:49.530 --> 03:50.588
ONCE WE GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

03:50.630 --> 03:51.779
MCNALLY.
YEAH?

03:51.830 --> 03:53.422
ASSIGNMENTS ARE UP.
IT'S YOU AND ME TODAY.

03:53.460 --> 03:54.950
MORNING, NASH.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.224
PERFECT.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.407
HEY.
HI.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.702
(clatter)
OH, SORRY.

04:06.740 --> 04:08.503
(Chloe laughs)
SORRY.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.770
I'M SORRY. LET ME HELP YOU.
NO, IT'S OKAY.

04:10.810 --> 04:15.679
WOW. UH, I HAVEN'T DROPPED A BAG
OVER A GUY SINCE THE 11th GRADE.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.688
TYLER WOTMO.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.915
HOW'D THAT
WORK OUT FOR YOU?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.622
HE WAS A NICE GUY.
TERRIBLE BACNE, THOUGH.

04:22.660 --> 04:24.321
SO MIXED?
YEAH.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.725
HMM.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.296
I'LL, UM, SEE YOU...

04:27.330 --> 04:28.297
LATER?

04:28.330 --> 04:29.251
LATER.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.630
(door opens)

04:32.670 --> 04:34.297
WHAT WAS THAT?
(laughs)

04:34.340 --> 04:36.661
WHAT?

04:36.710 --> 04:37.859
I... OKAY.

04:37.910 --> 04:41.937
I, UH, I ASKED CHLOE OUT
ON A DATE.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.572
WAIT, YOU DID?
OH. WOW, YEAH. THAT'S GREAT.

04:43.610 --> 04:44.372
WHAT ABOUT FRANK?

04:44.410 --> 04:46.617
I KNOW.
POTENTIAL CAREER SUICIDE.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.777
THAT'S WHY I'M KEEPING IT
ON THE D.L.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.516
WELL, HERE'S A TIP--
LESS GOOGLY EYES.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.950
HEY, SHE DROPPED SOMETHING.

04:55.490 --> 04:56.718
(P.A. tone chimes)

04:56.760 --> 04:59.729
(woman speaking indistinctly)

05:01.130 --> 05:02.791
"OL-571."

05:02.830 --> 05:03.967
OLANZAPINE?

05:05.070 --> 05:06.094
YEAH. WHAT'S THAT?

05:06.130 --> 05:08.928
WELL, WANDA
USED TO TAKE THAT.

05:08.970 --> 05:09.937
DOV, THAT'S...

05:09.970 --> 05:12.677
IT'S FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER.

05:12.710 --> 05:16.373
YOU... THINK CHLOE
HAS BIPOLAR DISORDER?

05:16.410 --> 05:18.674
THOSE COULD BE ANYBODY'S.
THEY COULD BE ANYBODY'S.
OH, YEAH, NO.
I DON'T KNOW.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.769
YEAH, BUT STILL, THAT WOULD
EXPLAIN A LOT OF THINGS.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.845
I MEAN, HER SUDDEN TRANSFER
FROM 27...

05:22.890 --> 05:24.778
INTO HER GODFATHER'S DIVISION.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.788
PLUS SHE SEEMS...
KIND OF CRAZY.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.617
CHRIS, WE'RE NOT...
SOMETIMES.

05:28.660 --> 05:31.424
LISTEN, DOV, JUST LEAVE 'EM
WHERE YOU FOUND THEM.

05:31.460 --> 05:32.950
WHOEVER'S THEY ARE,
THEY'LL COME BACK FOR THEM.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.820
YEP, SHE'S TOTALLY RIGHT.
THIS IS NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.418
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. ARE YOU
EVEN ALLOWED TO BE A COP

05:36.470 --> 05:37.528
IF YOU'RE...
(whispers) BIPOLAR?

05:37.570 --> 05:38.662
(knock on window)

05:38.700 --> 05:40.361
PARADE ROOM, KIDS.
LET'S GO.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.335
(buzzer in distance)

05:45.070 --> 05:47.732
(helicopter blades whirring)

05:49.980 --> 05:51.845
OH, SO I LOOKED UP
THE MOVIE LAST NIGHT.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.418
SEX ZOMBIES.
THAT'S A BOLD CHOICE.

05:55.450 --> 05:56.678
MISSING SOMETHING?

05:56.720 --> 05:57.948
BUT IT IS FROM THE '70s,

05:57.990 --> 05:59.389
SO I GUESS
WE COULD JUST PRETEND

05:59.420 --> 06:01.058
IT'S ABOUT GENDER POLITICS
OR SOMETHING.

06:01.090 --> 06:03.422
I'M SURE THEY DID, RIGHT?
(laughs)

06:03.460 --> 06:05.382
ARE YOU OKAY?

06:05.430 --> 06:07.751
YOU LOOK ALL... FURROWED.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.394
ARE YOU HUNGOVER?
NO.

06:10.430 --> 06:11.397
SHOULD I DRIVE?

06:11.430 --> 06:12.966
NO, I'LL DRIVE.
THANK YOU.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.092
OKAY.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.131
(female dispatcher) 15-19,
EMS is requesting support.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.968
Corner of Crawford and Lobb.
(static crackles)

06:19.010 --> 06:21.171
COPY, 15-19.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.041
(siren wailing)

06:23.080 --> 06:24.707
(man) JOELLE.
EXCUSE ME.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.014
GET BACK, FOLKS.
GET BACK, PLEASE.
CAN YOU HEAR ME, JOELLE?

06:27.050 --> 06:28.449
ABOUT TIME.
THIS GUY WON'T LET US WORK.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.845
SAY SOMETHING! JOELLE!
JOELLE!
SIR. SIR.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.949
STAY BACK. STEP BACK!

06:31.990 --> 06:33.582
THEY'VE MADE A MISTAKE, OKAY?
THEY THINK SHE'S OVERDOSED.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.156
OKAY, WELL, YOU NEED
TO LET THEM DO THEIR JOB.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.555
MY WIFE DOESN'T USE HEROIN.

06:36.590 --> 06:37.852
I'M HER HUSBAND, OKAY?
I SHOULD KNOW.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.154
JOELLE. JOELLE,
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.690
OKAY. OKAY.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.698
THIS WOMAN O.D.'d?

06:43.730 --> 06:44.992
SHORT ANSWER, YEAH.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.691
TRACK MARKS, SHALLOW BREATHING,
DISCOLORATION.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.560
SHE WON'T RESPOND
TO THE NALOXONE WE GAVE HER,

06:48.600 --> 06:49.760
SO WE'RE TAKING HER IN.
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.131
I MEAN, HOW DID HE DO IT?
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
WHO? WHO?

06:52.170 --> 06:53.728
HOW DID WHO DO WHAT?

06:53.780 --> 06:56.101
NATHAN. HER EX, OKAY?
HE'S A JUNKIE. SHE'S NOT.

06:56.140 --> 06:58.938
SHE'S... SHE'S MY WIFE, OKAY?
(car door closes)

06:58.980 --> 07:00.641
HONEY. HONEY, I'M COMING.
HEY. HEY.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.715
HEY, HEY, HEY!
STEP BACK.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.217
GET OFF. YOU GET OFF!

07:03.250 --> 07:05.047
YEAH, THIS GUY'S
NOT COMING WITH US.

07:05.090 --> 07:08.548
TALK TO US. WHO IS NATHAN?
WHAT DID HE DO?

07:08.590 --> 07:10.956
LOOK, IT'S NATHAN BARNES.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.799
IT'S HER EX-BOYFRIEND.

07:12.830 --> 07:16.220
IF SHE IS USING DRUGS,
IT'S WITH HIM.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.898
OKAY, WELL, WE WILL
SEND AN OFFICER TO TALK TO HIM

07:17.930 --> 07:20.694
IF YOU CALM DOWN. DEAL?

07:20.740 --> 07:24.460
(siren wails)

07:24.510 --> 07:27.479
(radio chatter)

07:27.510 --> 07:30.877
SO DO YOU...
HAVE A BIG FAMILY?

07:30.910 --> 07:32.878
NO. WHY?

07:32.920 --> 07:33.909
JUST CURIOUS.

07:33.950 --> 07:36.987
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT SAYS
A LOT ABOUT A PERSON--

07:37.020 --> 07:38.840
SIZE OF THEIR FAMILY.

07:38.890 --> 07:41.518
DOES IT? WELL, DO YOU
HAVE A BIG FAMILY?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.925
NO.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.621
WHAT DOES THAT SAY
ABOUT YOU?

07:48.130 --> 07:49.597
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
THE WHOLE

07:49.630 --> 07:51.825
"GET TO KNOW YOU" THING,
OKAY?

07:51.870 --> 07:54.759
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I FIGURED WE RIDE TOGETHER,

07:54.800 --> 07:56.700
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY.

07:56.740 --> 07:57.968
OH, I DISAGREE.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.535
IN FACT, I THINK IT'S HARMFUL
TO A GOOD POLICE PARTNERSHIP.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.275
HARMFUL?

08:02.310 --> 08:04.608
YEAH.
I DON'T NEED THE DRAMA.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.538
RATHER JUST DO MY JOB.

08:06.580 --> 08:11.085
SO THEN
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND SAM?

08:11.120 --> 08:13.850
SAM AND I WORK BECAUSE WE KEEP
AN EMOTIONAL DISTANCE.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.710
(blows raspberry)
THAT I CAN PICTURE.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.159
(female dispatcher)
15-74, come in.

08:17.190 --> 08:19.055
(static crackles)
GO FOR 15-74.

08:19.090 --> 08:21.888
15-19's requesting support

08:23.830 --> 08:24.967

08:27.840 --> 08:30.058
ALL RIGHT, THANKS, DOV.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.260

08:32.310 --> 08:35.074
ALLEGEDLY SUPPLIED HEROIN

09:02.910 --> 09:04.161
HEY, BUD.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.303

09:06.340 --> 09:07.898
HI.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.602

09:11.650 --> 09:14.869
(exhales)
OH, MY GOD,
PUT HIM DOWN.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.047
COME HERE. GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.240
OH, MY GOD. THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME I'VE USED.

09:19.290 --> 09:21.258
(handcuffs clicking)
WHOA, WHOA.
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.053
WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR ARMS?

09:23.090 --> 09:24.352
WHAT IS THAT?

09:24.390 --> 09:27.689
YEAH, THOSE. I'M NOT SURE.

09:27.730 --> 09:31.723
ONE, TWO, THREE.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.635
(thud)
OKAY.

09:33.670 --> 09:36.138

09:36.170 --> 09:38.138
(static crackles)

09:43.250 --> 09:45.605
WHEN SHE STABILIZES,
WE'LL GET A STATEMENT.

09:45.650 --> 09:46.719
OKAY.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.913
OFFICERS, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STEP OUT OF THE ROOM.

09:49.950 --> 09:52.180
SIR, YOU, TOO.
EVERYONE OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG?

09:52.220 --> 09:54.085
YOUR WIFE DIDN'T OVERDOSE.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.951
IT'S MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT.

09:55.990 --> 09:57.958
COME ON. EVERYONE OUT
RIGHT NOW.

10:00.660 --> 10:03.265
(Frank over radio) 15-74,
This is Staff Sergeant Best.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.825
What's your status?
(static crackles)

10:05.870 --> 10:07.337
SARGE, JUST HANDED OFF
OUR GUY.

10:07.370 --> 10:08.337
WE'RE ABOUT_TO BAG HIS DRUGS.
(static crackles)

10:08.370 --> 10:13.774
Negative, 15-74.
Stand down. Repeat, stand down.

10:13.810 --> 10:16.870
His drug supply is contaminated.

10:16.910 --> 10:19.811
CONTAMINATED? WITH WHAT?

10:19.850 --> 10:21.317
Anthrax.

10:29.090 --> 10:32.799
ALL RIGHT. YEAH. OKAY.
I GOT IT.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.195
WHAT?
(cell phone beeps)

10:34.230 --> 10:36.255
THEY SAID TO WAIT IN HERE
FOR THE HAZMAT TEAM.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.393
THAT'S IT?

10:38.430 --> 10:39.761
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
ALL THIS?

10:39.800 --> 10:42.166
THEY DON'T KNOW.
SPECIALISTS ARE COMING.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.428
OH, THAT'S AWESOME.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.108
I AM GONNA JUST REALLY--
MCNALLY. MCNALLY!

10:45.140 --> 10:46.300
CALM DOWN!

10:46.340 --> 10:48.399
OH, MY GOD! YOU ARE NOT JUST
GONNA PLAY IT COOL RIGHT NOW!

10:48.440 --> 10:49.805
(exhales)

10:49.850 --> 10:51.147
THE MORE YOU FREAK OUT,

10:51.180 --> 10:53.171
THE MORE YOU'RE GONNA
SPREAD THAT STUFF AROUND.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.017
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

10:55.050 --> 10:57.780
(exhales deeply)
YOU EVER LET IT GO?

10:59.220 --> 11:00.187
LET WHAT GO?

11:00.220 --> 11:01.756
YOU KNOW,
THE TOUGH-GUY ACT.

11:01.790 --> 11:04.224
THE ICE QUEEN ROUTINE.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.955
(scoffs) YEAH,
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU AND SAM

11:05.990 --> 11:08.299
ARE JUST REALLY PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER, AREN'T YOU?

11:08.330 --> 11:09.888
AND... SAM AGAIN.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.158
YEAH, AND SAM AGAIN.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.360
YOU KNOW, HE'S THE ONLY
OTHER PERSON I KNOW

11:12.400 --> 11:13.890
THAT WOULD GET COVERED
IN ANTHRAX

11:13.940 --> 11:15.430
AND THEN CHILL OUT.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.859
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE MOST
IN THE WORLD?

11:17.910 --> 11:19.229
KITTENS? LAUGHTER?

11:19.270 --> 11:22.307
TWO GIRLS
STANDING IN A ROOM

11:22.340 --> 11:24.877
SHOUTING ABOUT A GUY
WHO'S NOT EVEN THERE.

11:24.910 --> 11:28.038
WE ARE IN A SITUATION HERE.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.741
CAN WE KEEP
OUR HEADS TOGETHER, OKAY?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.041
JUST GET THROUGH IT.

11:33.490 --> 11:36.459
(indistinct conversations)

11:39.330 --> 11:41.298
CRUZ AND MCNALLY--
ARE THEY ALL RIGHT?

11:41.330 --> 11:42.820
WE DON'T KNOW.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.360
BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING
WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET,

11:44.400 --> 11:45.492
YOU UNDERSTAND?

11:45.530 --> 11:47.464
THERE'S PEOPLE ON IT.
I NEED YOU HERE.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.990
ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT
ARE WE DEALING WITH?

11:49.040 --> 11:49.836
THE DOCTORS ARE SAYING

11:49.870 --> 11:51.508
THE ANTHRAX
IS IN THE HEROIN SUPPLY.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.201
WHAT? HOW?

11:53.240 --> 11:55.208
IT'S EARLY. WE'RE STILL TRYING
TO PIECE IT TOGETHER.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.208
I'VE BROUGHT IN HELP
FROM DRUG SQUAD.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.842
GOOD. LET'S GET TO WORK.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.108
JACOB BLACKSTONE.

12:00.150 --> 12:03.916
LOOK, SAM, HE'S FAMILIAR
WITH CASES LIKE THIS.

12:03.950 --> 12:06.180
HE'S GONNA RUN IT.
THAT GONNA BE A PROBLEM?

12:06.220 --> 12:08.154
NO, SIR. NOT TODAY.

12:08.190 --> 12:09.157
GOOD.

12:09.190 --> 12:11.488
SO THE ANTHRAX BACTERIA

12:11.530 --> 12:13.896
IS GETTING INTO THE HEROIN
SUPPLIES BY NATURAL MEANS.

12:13.930 --> 12:16.353
IT'S HAPPENING OVERSEAS
AT THE POINT OF PRODUCTION.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.493
SOMETIMES IT'S FROM BONE MEAL
USED TO CUT THE DRUGS,

12:18.530 --> 12:21.966
SOMETIMES FROM ANIMAL HIDES
USED TO TRANSPORT IT.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.900
NOW ONCE THE DIRTY DRUG
HITS THE STREETS,

12:23.940 --> 12:26.909
USERS ARE DROPPING LIKE FLIES.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.306
GLASGOW, SCOTLAND,
TWO YEARS AGO--

12:29.340 --> 12:32.047
150 INFECTED, 14 DEAD.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.116
NOW WE'VE GOT TWO
CONFIRMED CASES SO FAR--

12:34.150 --> 12:36.983
THE HOUSEWIFE
AND GALLERY OWNER.

12:37.020 --> 12:39.045
BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.285
AND USERS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
DON'T EVEN KNOW IT YET.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.049
WE GOTTA FIND THEM.
WE GOTTA GET 'EM INTO TREATMENT.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.285
THE DISEASE CAN KILL 'EM
IN 48 HOURS FLAT.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.197
SHAW, YOU'LL HEAD THAT UP.
WORK THE STREETS.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.299
YEAH, WE GOT THAT, SURE.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.558
SECOND PART OF THIS THING--

12:50.600 --> 12:52.568
WE NEED TO FIND THE SOURCE
OF THE DIRTY DRUGS

12:52.600 --> 12:55.160
AND LOCK IT DOWN.
SWAREK, NASH, THAT'S YOU.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.236
WHY DON'T YOU START
WITH THE GALLERY _OWNER?
(whispering indistinctly)

12:57.270 --> 12:58.862
FIND OUT WHO SOLD IT
TO HIM,

12:58.910 --> 13:01.037
WHO HIS SUPPLIER IS,
MOVE ON UP THE CHAIN.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.174
THE FASTER WE FIND IT,
THE MORE PEOPLE WE SAVE.

13:04.210 --> 13:06.303
NOW WE'VE GOT TEAMS
IN ALL DOWNTOWN DIVISIONS.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.443
WE'LL GO CITYWIDE
IF WE HAVE TO.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.981
IF WE'RE DEALING
WITH SICK PEOPLE,

13:10.020 --> 13:11.419
IS THERE A CHANCE
THAT WE CAN CATCH IT?

13:11.450 --> 13:12.519
NO. IT IS NOT CONTAGIOUS.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.586
YOU CANNOT CATCH IT
FROM ANOTHER PERSON.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.180
THE DANGER HERE
IS IN THE DIRTY DRUGS.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.186
THAT IS WHERE
THE INFECTIOUS SPORES LIE.

13:19.230 --> 13:20.925
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH,
PEOPLE.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.190
NOW IF YOU FIND ANY,
WALK AWAY.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.595
CALL IT IN,
WE'LL SEND A TEAM.

13:24.630 --> 13:25.426
THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.961
COLLINS, YOU SERVED
IN AFGHANISTAN?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.207
PERSON DIES, THEY START
TO PRODUCE THE SPORES.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.559
CORPSES ARE DEADLY.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.602
EXACTLY. YOU FIND A BODY,
SAME THING.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.301
YOU WALK AWAY,
YOU CALL IT IN.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.149
LET'S GET TO WORK, FOLKS.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.319
THAN KS.

13:40.350 --> 13:44.889
YOU KNOW WHAT? I COULD PROBABLY
USE SOME BACKUP ON THIS END.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.581
YOU WANT COLLINS?

13:46.620 --> 13:47.609
I'LL DO IT.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.185
I'M SURE COLLINS
WOULD RATHER BE IN THE FIELD.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.925
IT'S... FINE BY ME.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.554
VERY WELL.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.624
HEY. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

13:55.660 --> 13:58.060
GAIL PECK.
AT YOUR SERVICE.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.239
(Oliver)
SHELTERS, SOUP KITCHENS, PARKS.

14:01.270 --> 14:03.329
IT'S A WIDE NET, PEOPLE.
LET'S GO.

14:03.370 --> 14:06.635
OLIVER, YOU MIND
IF I DRIVE?

14:06.670 --> 14:08.934
IN OUR WHOLE HISTORY TOGETHER,

14:08.980 --> 14:11.471
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT
I WOULD ANSWER "YES" TO THAT?

14:11.510 --> 14:13.876
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT...

14:13.920 --> 14:16.070
I'D REALLY LIKE TO TAKE
THE LEAD ON THIS THING,

14:16.120 --> 14:16.882
IF THAT'S OKAY.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.911
NOT EXACTLY
A GLAMOUR CASE, DIAZ.

14:18.950 --> 14:19.951
WE'RE GOING TO THE TRENCHES.

14:19.990 --> 14:23.050
BUT STILL,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.978
YEAH.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.383
(car alarm chirps)

14:28.530 --> 14:30.395
I'LL GO TO THE HOSPITAL,
TALK TO THE VICTIMS.

14:30.430 --> 14:32.125
OKAY. GOOD.
I'LL CALL CRUZ AND MCNALLY,

14:32.170 --> 14:34.035
SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING,
ALL RIGHT?

14:34.070 --> 14:36.903
(exhales deeply)

14:36.940 --> 14:40.637
(clattering)

14:40.680 --> 14:42.329
(cell phone rings)

14:42.380 --> 14:43.347
(beeps)

14:43.380 --> 14:44.347
HEY, SAM.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.143
(Sam) Hey.
How you holding up?

14:46.180 --> 14:48.114
UH, REMEMBER HOW I SAID
I LIKED ABSTRACT ART?

14:48.150 --> 14:49.674
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

14:49.720 --> 14:53.451
OKAY. UH, YOU KNOW EXPERTS
ARE ON THEIR WAY, RIGHT?

14:53.490 --> 14:54.980
YEAH.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.920
MAYBE I CAN DISTRACT YOU
WITH SOME POLICE WORK?

14:56.960 --> 14:59.053
PLEASE DO.
PUT YOU ON SPEAKER.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.591
(beeps)

15:00.630 --> 15:02.325
HEY, SAM.
McNally.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.021
ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE, HUH?
HOW YOU DOING?

15:04.070 --> 15:06.459
OH, YOU KNOW.
I hear ya.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.639
LISTEN, WE GOTTA TRACK THIS
THING UP THE SUPPLY LINE.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.706
SO ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT THE DRUG

15:10.740 --> 15:12.207
might be helpful.
COPY THAT.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.105
OKAY, BUT DO NOT GET ANY OF IT

15:14.140 --> 15:16.074
on you, understand?

15:16.110 --> 15:16.906
SURE THING.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.611
THE GLASSINES ARE STAMPED
"MIDNIGHT."

15:22.650 --> 15:24.345
It's powdered.
Slight yellow tint.
COLLINS.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.655
CHECK ALL RECENT DRUG BUSTS
FOR MIDNIGHT HEROIN, ALL RIGHT?

15:27.690 --> 15:29.351
OH. SAM, WE GOTTA GO.

15:29.390 --> 15:31.051
Okay, listen, you guys
are gonna be just fine.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.227
ALL RIGHT? I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN YOU GET OUT.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.625
ALL RIGHT. BYE.
BYE.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.627
(beeps)

15:36.230 --> 15:39.199
(muffled voice)
HI. I'M HOWARD.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.231
ARE YOU TWO SISTERS?

15:41.270 --> 15:42.430
OH.

15:42.470 --> 15:44.131
WELL, NONETHELESS, I'M HOWARD.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.102
HOW DO YOU DO?

15:47.740 --> 15:50.345
MR. BANCROFT, WHEN DID YOU FIRST
NOTICE YOUR WIFE WAS UNWELL?

15:50.380 --> 15:51.369
NOT UNTIL THIS MORNING.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.469
I-I LEFT THE HOUSE,
I WAS GOING TO MY CLINIC,

15:53.520 --> 15:56.739
AND THERE SHE WAS. YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS LYING ON THE SIDEWALK.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.589
DO YOU KNOW WHEN
SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD CONTACT

15:58.620 --> 16:00.485
WITH THE CONTAMINATED DRUGS?
I-I-I HAD NO IDEA

16:00.520 --> 16:02.215
THAT SHE WAS
EVEN TOUCHING HEROIN.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.728
OKAY? SO I DON'T KNOW HOW--
HOW THIS COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.990
MR. BANCROFT,
EVEN THE SMALLEST DETAIL

16:07.030 --> 16:08.019
COULD HELP US BUILD
A TIMELINE.

16:08.060 --> 16:11.621
UM, LOOK, NATHAN WAS HAVING,
UH, AN ART OPENING,

16:11.670 --> 16:13.365
AND--AND SHE WANTED TO GO.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.130
UH, SO WE FOUGHT
ABOUT IT.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.468
I TRIED TO PUT
MY FOOT DOWN.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.761
SHE WENT ANWVAY.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.005
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENED.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.075
WHEN WAS THAT?

16:23.110 --> 16:24.668
UH... UH, THURSDAY.

16:24.710 --> 16:28.339
OKAY. THANK YOU,
MR. BANCROFT.
OKAY.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.677
(door opens)
(Dov) THREE DAYS--

16:29.720 --> 16:31.017
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH
THE PROGRESS OF THE DISEASE.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.586
(Traci) OKAY.
IF SHE WAKES UP,

16:32.620 --> 16:34.417
AND IF NATHAN BARNES DOES,
GET MORE.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.711
WHEN, WHERE,
WHO WAS THERE.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.479
GOT IT.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.727
POOR GUY.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.091
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.165
UH, DOCTOR, DO YOU MIND--

16:44.200 --> 16:46.623
COULD I, UH, JUST ASK YOU
A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS

16:46.670 --> 16:49.696
ABOUT--WHAT COULD YOU TELL ME
ABOUT BIPOLAR DISORDER?

16:49.740 --> 16:51.105
THAT'S NOT REALLY MY AREA.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.279
NO, JUST BROADLY,
IF--IF YOU DON'T MIND.

16:53.310 --> 16:56.029
WELL, IT'S A MOOD DISORDER,
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW,

16:56.080 --> 16:58.799
DEFINED BY EXTREME SWINGS
FROM DEPRESSION TO MANIA.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.818
MANIA--IS THAT LIKE,
UM, YOU KNOW,

17:00.850 --> 17:02.442
TALKING A LOT?
RANDOM THOUGHTS?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.708
SURE, SURE, SURE.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.479
PEOPLE EXPERIENCE
WHAT'S CALLED FLIGHT OF IDEAS.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.181
UH, RACING THOUGHTS.
CLUTTERED SPEECH.

17:07.220 --> 17:09.609
IS IT SERIOUS?
IT CAN BE.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.355
EXTREME CASES
CAN LEAD TO PSYCHOSIS--

17:11.390 --> 17:13.324
DELUSIONS, HALLUCINATIONS.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.691
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

17:14.730 --> 17:18.393
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

17:21.270 --> 17:23.602
THIS IS A LATERAL FLOW
SCREENING ASSAY.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.562
IT'S GONNA CONFIRM FOR US

17:25.610 --> 17:29.569
IF ANTHRACIS BACILLUS
IS PRESENT,

17:29.610 --> 17:32.841
AND AT WHAT CONCENTR--
OH, WOW.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.110
IS THAT POSITIVE?

17:35.150 --> 17:37.243
YEAH. OFF THE CHARTS.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.814
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:38.850 --> 17:41.512
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
ANTIBIOTICS, THAT'S FOR SURE.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.811
YOU KNOW,
TO WARD OFF THE DISEASE.

17:42.860 --> 17:45.385
AND SOME FOLLOW-UP SHOTS
DOWN THE ROAD.
WHOA. HOLD ON A SECOND.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.751
WARD OFF?
YOU MEAN LIKE, PREVENT?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.358
YEAH. YEAH, OF COURSE.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.799
IT'S EARLY.
IT'S ENTIRELY TREATABLE.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.460
WAIT, YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

17:54.500 --> 17:55.831
UH... NO.

17:55.870 --> 17:59.806
OH. WOW. SORRY. UH, YEAH.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.478
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE FINE.

18:01.510 --> 18:03.375
OH, YOU MUST BE
HUGELY RELIEVED.

18:03.410 --> 18:06.402
YEAH. YOU DON'T GET OUT
OF THE LAB MUCH, DO YOU, HOWARD?

18:06.450 --> 18:09.772
OKAY, SO... SO THAT'S IT?
WE'RE OKAY?

18:09.820 --> 18:13.153
TOTALLY. JUST NEED
TO DECONTAMINATE YOU.

18:13.190 --> 18:14.452
OKAY. HOW DOES THAT WORK?

18:14.490 --> 18:16.355
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE CLOSE.

18:16.390 --> 18:18.483
UM... 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS

18:18.530 --> 18:20.555
AND TAKE OF ALL YOUR CLOTHES.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.797
HEY, MIDNIGHT HEROIN--
SHOWS UP IN NINE ARRESTS.

18:25.830 --> 18:28.390
ALL SMALL-TIME USERS,
ALL WITHIN THE LAST WEEK.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.566
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE, RIGHT?

18:29.600 --> 18:32.660
NEW PRODUCT. THAT'S WHY
THE DISEASE IS SURFACING NOW.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.507
TH ESE ARRESTS ARE SPREAD
ALL OVER THE CITY,

18:34.540 --> 18:36.508
BUT THERE'S A BUNCH
NEAR KING AND NIAGARA.

18:36.540 --> 18:39.338
KING AND NIAGARA?
THAT'S NEAR THE GALLERY.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.371
THINK HIS HOOK-UP'S DOWN THERE?

18:41.420 --> 18:43.638
WELL, YOU KNOW,
JUNKIES LOVE TO SHOP LOCAL.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.782
SIR?
YEAH?

18:44.820 --> 18:46.640
I JUST GOT WORD
FROM ST. PAT'S,

18:46.690 --> 18:48.385
AND A YOUNG MAN WAS ADMITTED
A FEW MINUTES AGO,

18:48.420 --> 18:50.388
LATE-STAGE ANTHRAX.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.829
(sighs)

18:51.860 --> 18:53.157
SEND...

18:53.200 --> 18:54.599
SEND NASH.

18:54.630 --> 18:55.722

over P.A.)

18:55.760 --> 18:58.593
THANKS. YOU, UH, GOT ANY C.I.s
NEAR KING AND NIAGARA?

18:58.630 --> 18:59.597

OKAY. COLLINS, WITH ME.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.638
YES, SIR.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.262
HERE WE GO.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.508
DETECTIVE?

19:12.550 --> 19:13.517
YEAH?

19:13.550 --> 19:16.371
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

19:17.690 --> 19:20.409
YOU RAN
THE FORT ERIE U.C. OPERATION

19:20.460 --> 19:21.813
WITH COLLINS AND MCNALLY.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.758
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:22.790 --> 19:24.724
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.399
WHY IS THAT? YOU THINKING
OF GOING INTO UNDERCOVER?

19:27.430 --> 19:28.397
YES. DEFINITELY.

19:28.430 --> 19:31.558
I JUST WANNA LEARN,
YOU KNOW, ABOUT THE LIFE.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.659
I THINK YOU SHOULD ASK MCNALLY
OR COLLINS. THEY LIVED IT.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.668
YEAH, I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR MORE OF AN OVERVIEW

19:35.700 --> 19:37.702
FROM SOMEONE WHO SAW
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON.

19:37.740 --> 19:40.573
ALL RIGHT.
UH, GOOD OPERATION.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.703
THEY WERE SOLID.
THEY TOOK TO THE JOB.

19:42.740 --> 19:43.570
THEY GOT ALONG WELL.

19:43.610 --> 19:45.441
YEAH, BUT THEY WOULD
HAVE TO GET ALONG.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.278
I MEAN, THEY WERE PLAYING
BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND, RIGHT?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.788
YEAH, BUT EVEN IN THEIR
FREE TIME, THERE WAS A RAPPORT.

19:50.820 --> 19:52.344
SO, YOU KNOW,
IT MAKES MY JOB EASIER.

19:52.390 --> 19:53.254
FREE TIME?

19:53.290 --> 19:55.212
I LIKE TO GIVE MY GUYS
THE WEEKEND OFF

19:55.260 --> 19:56.887
FROM, YOU KNOW,
A LONG OPERATION.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.785
THEY CAN GO HOME,
THEY CHECK IN SINCE THERE'S, UH,

19:58.830 --> 20:00.752
NO PHONE CALLING
OR E-MAILING.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.824
SO HE COULD HAVE COME HOME
IF HE WANTED?

20:06.870 --> 20:08.667
COLLINS? YEAH,
HE COULD HAVE GONE HOME.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.600
BUT THEY DECIDED TO SPEND
THE WEEKEND TOGETHER.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.302
UH, WENT TO NIAGARA,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.570
A LITTLE BIKE TRIP.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.548

20:21.580 --> 20:25.789
SO, OFFICER PECK, YOU'RE, UH,

I'VE, UH, I'VE SAID TOO MUCH,

20:29.790 --> 20:33.897
AND I NEED YOU TO SUCK IT UP
AND GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.

20:33.930 --> 20:36.592
UNDERSTAND?

20:36.630 --> 20:37.961
TOTALLY.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.796

20:47.840 --> 20:49.979

THE, UH, ALL THE JUNKIES

20:50.010 --> 20:51.409

20:51.450 --> 20:53.771
HELLO, SIR! WHOA!

20:53.820 --> 20:55.447

20:59.390 --> 21:02.018
OFFICER DIAZ.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.652

CEDRIC, THERE'S SOME
BAD HEROIN FLOATING AROUND,

21:13.570 --> 21:14.798
AND ALL WE NEED TO KNOW

21:14.840 --> 21:16.330
IS IF YOU'VE SEEN
ANYONE THAT LOOKS SICK.

21:16.370 --> 21:20.534
LIKE DIZZINESS.
VOMIT. SORES.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.377
COME ON, CEDRIC. WE'RE ON
THE SAME TEAM TODAY, OKAY?

21:22.410 --> 21:23.547
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.549
(traffic noise in distance)

21:29.050 --> 21:30.813
LAST NIGHT,
A KID CAME TO SCORE.

21:30.850 --> 21:33.318
ROUGH SHAPE.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.850
HIS ARMS WERE--WERE ALL RED

21:34.890 --> 21:37.654
LIKE--LIKE THEY'D BEEN,
UH, BLOWTORCHED.

21:37.690 --> 21:38.827
HEY, YEAH. THAT KID.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.088
THAT KID.
DO YOU KNOW THAT KID'S NAME?

21:40.130 --> 21:41.950
NO, I-I JUST
SEEN HIM AROUND.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.490
NO.
ALL RIGHT.

21:43.530 --> 21:45.464
WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A DRIVE
AND FIND THAT GUY.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.730
OKAY?

21:47.770 --> 21:50.500
COME ON.

21:53.410 --> 21:56.937
OKAY. SO...
EVERYTHING COMES OFF.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.607
ALL OF IT.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.811

UNDER... PANTIES.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.759
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE US TO DO
WITH OUR UNDERPANTIES?

22:08.790 --> 22:10.849
UH, SET THEM ASIDE.
THEY'LL BE INCINERATED.

22:10.890 --> 22:13.529
I MEAN, WELL, ALL YOUR CLOTHES
WILL BE, NOT JUST YOUR...

22:13.560 --> 22:15.596
(chuckles nervously)
THAT--THAT'S OBVIOUS.

22:15.630 --> 22:17.689
AND OUR BELONGINGS?

22:17.730 --> 22:22.394
UH, TAKE EVERYTHING OUT.
WE'LL DECON WHAT WE CAN.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.032
SHOULDN'T WE BE DOING THIS
AT A HOSPITAL?

22:24.070 --> 22:26.538
YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPORES IN YOU
TO INFECT A SMALL VILLAGE.

22:26.570 --> 22:29.107
YOU STEP OUT THAT DOOR,
WE CAN'T CONTAIN IT.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.449
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.540
SO. ..
(latches click)

22:34.580 --> 22:36.946
BELONGINGS OUT ON THE TABLE...

22:36.980 --> 22:39.983
CLOTHES OFF, AND I'LL BE BACK.

22:46.460 --> 22:47.927
APPRECIATE IT.
THAT'S FOR YOU.

22:51.730 --> 22:53.459
DID YOU GET A NAME?

22:53.500 --> 22:55.866
NOPE.

22:55.900 --> 22:59.108
A NAME, DESCRIPTION,
THE BAR WHERE HE WORKS.

22:59.140 --> 23:02.109
**

23:02.140 --> 23:04.973
HELLO? WENDEL?

23:05.010 --> 23:06.045
YEP?

23:06.080 --> 23:11.040
**

23:11.090 --> 23:13.081
YOU GOT ANY, UH, PRODUCT ON YOU?

23:13.120 --> 23:14.815
(chuckles)

23:14.860 --> 23:17.681
UH, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
A BIT OF A TALENT FOR THIS,

23:17.730 --> 23:20.085
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT YOU GUYS ARE COPS.

23:20.130 --> 23:22.121
OKAY. YOU SOLD HEROIN
TO A GUY NAMED NATHAN BARNES,

23:22.160 --> 23:24.594
AND THAT HEROIN
HAD ANTHRAX IN IT.

23:24.630 --> 23:25.619
WHAT?

23:25.670 --> 23:28.491
YEAH, ANTHRAX, WHICH MEANS
YOU NEARLY KILLED HIM

23:28.540 --> 23:30.633
AS WELL AS A YOUNG WOMAN
WHO SHARED HIS DRUGS,

23:30.670 --> 23:32.103
AND GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.574
IT'S CALLED MIDNIGHT HEROIN.

23:34.610 --> 23:35.679
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.109
OKAY. WELL, WE'VE BEEN DOING

23:37.140 --> 23:38.539
A LITTLE HOMEWORK ON THIS,
WENDEL,

23:38.580 --> 23:39.547
AND HERE'S WHAT
YOU NEED TO KNOW...

23:39.580 --> 23:41.912
YOU INJECT THIS STUFF,
YOU'RE DEAD IN 48 HOURS.

23:41.950 --> 23:43.986
OKAY, LOOK, YOU GUYS
GOT THIS WRONG.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.113
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU GOT YOUR INFORMATION FROM,

23:46.150 --> 23:48.118
BUT SOMEBODY'S BEEN...
OKAY. YOU CAN ALSO
GET THE DISEASE

23:48.160 --> 23:49.650
BY HANDLING IT.

23:49.690 --> 23:50.850
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GET SOME IN A CUT,

23:50.890 --> 23:52.619
RUB YOUR EYES,
INHALE A FEW OF THE SPORES,

23:52.660 --> 23:53.695
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.129
HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
WENDEL?

23:55.160 --> 23:56.627
I FEEL FINE.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.719
OKAY. WELL, THE DISEASE
INCUBATES A LITTLE WHILE.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.591
SORE THROAT, MAYBE A LITTLE
FATIGUE. NO BIG DEAL.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.164
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE PUKING PURE BLOOD.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.805
YOU LOOK A LITTLE FLUSHED
TO ME. YEAH.
MM-HMM.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.728
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?
FEVER'S ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.929
NOW WE CAN GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL,

24:08.980 --> 24:11.107
GET YOU SOME ANTIBIOTICS,
YOU KNOW?

24:11.150 --> 24:12.503
THAT'D BE THE SMART THING
TO DO

24:12.550 --> 24:13.710
IF YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU DID HANDLE

24:13.750 --> 24:15.240
A LITTLE MIDNIGHT HEROIN
AFTER ALL?

24:15.280 --> 24:18.511
DID YOU, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT?

24:18.550 --> 24:20.609
YEAH, HE'S NOT CARRYING
RIGHT NOW.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.809
GUY'S JUST A MIDDLE MAN.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.988
BUT HE DID CONFIRM HE SOLD
TO NATHAN BARNES FIVE DAYS AGO.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.224
HOW ABOUT HIS SUPPLIER?

24:26.260 --> 24:29.229
WHITE, EARLY 40$,
GOES BY THE NAME "BOOSH."

24:29.260 --> 24:31.990
(chuckles) REALLY?
I'M NEVER THIS LUCKY.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.167
WHAT, YOU KNOW HIM?

24:33.200 --> 24:34.235
Yeah, I know him.

24:34.270 --> 24:35.760
We've had eyes on him
for a while.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.767
WILLIAM BOUCHARD.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.802
LISTEN, CALL UP HIS FILE,
SEND IT TO SWAREK.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.137
I NEED YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME--

24:40.170 --> 24:44.106
THIS GUY HAS A DIRECT LINE
TO A SUPPLIER OVERSEAS.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.708
SO THIS COULD BE
THE MOTHER LODE, SWAREK.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.069
Be real careful.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.975
YOU GOT IT.

24:49.020 --> 24:52.080
FASTER WE DO THIS,
FASTER WE GET CLEANED UP.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.483
CRUZ, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

25:00.290 --> 25:01.996
TELL ME A SECRET,
MCNALLY.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.624
WHAT?

25:04.670 --> 25:07.230
SOMETHING BIG.
SOMETHING SCARY.

25:07.270 --> 25:09.636
NO. WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

25:09.670 --> 25:12.207
(clatter)
SO WE'RE EVEN...

25:16.280 --> 25:20.273
WHEN I DO THIS.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.582
YOURS.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.542
MUST HAVE DROPPED IT.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.888
I WENT BACK TO CHECK
AND I HEARD YOU GUYS TALKING.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.218
YOU WANTED TO GET
TO KNOW ME?

25:33.290 --> 25:34.291
HERE I AM.

25:42.270 --> 25:45.933
(clicking)

25:45.970 --> 25:47.608
(bullets clatter)

25:47.640 --> 25:49.870
COME ON, MCNALLY.

25:49.910 --> 25:51.343
SAY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

25:51.380 --> 25:52.699
NOTHING.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.115
(clatter)

25:54.150 --> 25:57.347
YOU'RE THINKING HOW CAN I BE
A COP AND BE BIPOLAR?

25:57.380 --> 26:00.144
NO. LOOK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

26:00.190 --> 26:02.681
ALL RIGHT. HOW CAN I
CARRY A GUN AROUND?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.948
HOW CAN I BACK MY PARTNER?

26:03.990 --> 26:05.821
I CAN'T EVEN
CONTROL MY OWN BRAIN.

26:05.860 --> 26:06.929
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M THINKING.

26:06.960 --> 26:10.999
COME ON. DON'T, OKAY?
I SEE YOUR FACE.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.066
I KNOW THAT EXPRESSION WELL.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.159
WELL, LOOK, IT'S--IT'S REALLY
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

26:15.200 --> 26:19.034
SO... LET'S JUST
GET THROUGH THIS.

26:19.070 --> 26:20.776
BUT YOU SEE, I'M--I'M FINE.

26:20.810 --> 26:23.176
OKAY? I'M MANAGING IT.
OKAY.

26:23.210 --> 26:24.609
I'M NOT SAYING
IT WASN'T SERIOUS.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.777
THERE WAS A TIME...

26:26.810 --> 26:28.277
A COUPLE YEARS
AFTER THE ACADEMY

26:28.320 --> 26:30.072
WHEN THINGS GOT BAD.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.883
BUT I GOT HELP,

26:31.920 --> 26:35.117
AND IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.309
I'M SURE IT IS.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.227
I MEAN I'M...
LOOK, I'M GLAD IT IS.

26:39.260 --> 26:41.148
ALL RIGHT?
IT CAN'T BE EASY.

26:46.870 --> 26:47.791
(exhales deeply)

26:58.110 --> 26:59.646
MCNALLY. ..

27:04.350 --> 27:09.811
LOOK, I'M...
I'M HANDLING IT, OKAY?

27:09.860 --> 27:13.250
PLEASE, I-I NEED YOU
TO BELIEVE ME, OKAY?

27:13.290 --> 27:15.224
OKAY.

27:18.700 --> 27:21.669
(gun clicks, radio chatter)

27:23.400 --> 27:26.335
(radio chatter continues)

27:32.410 --> 27:33.377
(Sam) HARD AND FAST.

27:33.410 --> 27:35.241
DO NOT LET 'EM
FLUSH THESE DRUGS.

27:37.050 --> 27:40.087
POLICE! GET DOWN!
GET ON THE GROUND!

27:40.120 --> 27:42.281
ON YOUR KNEES!
NOW! NOW! NOW!

27:42.320 --> 27:44.925
GET ON THE GROUND!
GET ON THE GROUND!

27:44.960 --> 27:46.757
STAY DOWN!
DON'T MOVE!

27:46.790 --> 27:49.020
(men shout indistinctly)

27:52.830 --> 27:55.333
(radio chatter)

27:58.740 --> 28:01.277
CALL IN THE TECHS.

28:03.140 --> 28:06.041
(indistinct conversations)

28:06.080 --> 28:08.446
GALLERY GUY'S
STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.742
CAF?

28:09.780 --> 28:11.088
NO, THANK YOU.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.042
(telephone ringing in distance)

28:13.090 --> 28:14.250
OKAY.

28:14.290 --> 28:17.726
(trash can clatters)

28:17.760 --> 28:20.149
YOU KNOW
HE'S A VETERINARIAN?

28:20.190 --> 28:21.896
SPENDS HIS DAYS
CARING FOR ANIMALS.

28:21.930 --> 28:24.296
PAYS THE MORTGAGE ON TIME.
BUYS SNOW TIRES.

28:24.330 --> 28:26.890
YOU GUYS TALKED
ABOUT TIRES?

28:26.930 --> 28:30.388
POINT IS, ALL SHE WANTS TO DO
IS GO OUT AND PARTY.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.908
LIKE OIL AND WATER.

28:32.940 --> 28:35.738
WELL,
SOMETIMES THAT CAN WORK.

28:35.780 --> 28:38.476
NOT IF YOU'RE NOT HONEST
ABOUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

28:41.820 --> 28:45.142
DIAZ, THIS IS STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE A BIT OF A GOOSE CHASE.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.839
CEDRIC SAYS
HE'S RIGHT DOWN HERE.

28:46.890 --> 28:49.279
YEAH? WELL, CEDRIC'S,
UH, POWERS OF RECALL

28:49.320 --> 28:52.756
DON'T SEEM PARTICULARLY,
UH... STATE-OF-TH E-ART.

28:52.790 --> 28:53.791
OH, REALLY?
YEAH, REALLY.

28:53.830 --> 28:54.956
'CAUSE I GOT A CALL LAST YEAR

28:55.000 --> 28:56.228
ABOUT A STOLEN
AIR CONDITIONER.
UH-HUH?

28:56.260 --> 28:58.023
SUSPECT DROVE A YELLOW VAN,

28:58.070 --> 28:59.924
AND THE GUY THAT TINTED
THE WINDOWS

28:59.970 --> 29:01.892
SAID THE CLIENT PAID
IN FROZEN SALMON.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.237
FROZEN SALMON. THAT'S GREAT.
YEAH.

29:03.270 --> 29:04.760
WHICH LED ME TO DOUG BURKE.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.368
UH-HUH.
GUY WHO STOLE
ALL THOSE REEFER TRUCKS?

29:06.410 --> 29:08.173
REMEMBER?
YES.

29:08.210 --> 29:09.871
ALL RIGHT.
DIAZ. ..

29:09.910 --> 29:11.502
JUST GO WITH ME.
ALL RIGHT.

29:11.550 --> 29:14.917
OKAY, CEDRIC PANHANDLES OUTSIDE
BURKE'S ELECTRONICS STORE.

29:14.950 --> 29:16.918
NOT ONLY DOES HE I.D.
THE YELLOW VAN,

29:16.950 --> 29:18.281
HE PUTS IT THERE
AT THE RIGHT TIME,

29:18.320 --> 29:20.242
AND HE REMEMBERS
THE LICENSE PLATE.

29:20.290 --> 29:21.314
(radio chatter)

29:21.360 --> 29:23.828
(flies buzzing)

29:23.860 --> 29:25.589
IT'S T-TOXIC.

29:29.460 --> 29:30.996
(cell phone buttons clicking)

29:31.030 --> 29:33.260
WE HAVE GOT
TO GET AHEAD OF THIS.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.500
BLACKSTONE, WE GOT
ANOTHER "X" FOR THE MAP.

29:39.870 --> 29:41.576
(radio chatter)

29:41.610 --> 29:43.305
(Sam) OKAY, START WORKING
BOUCHARD'S FILE.

29:43.340 --> 29:44.375
WE NEED HIS WHOLE NETWORK--

29:44.410 --> 29:47.106
NAMES, LOCATIONS.
RIGHT DOWN TO THE CORNER BOYS.

29:47.150 --> 29:48.549
GOT IT.
GET SOME MORE HANDS
ON THIS,

29:48.580 --> 29:49.979
'CAUSE ONCE WE RUN THEM DOWN,

29:50.020 --> 29:53.239
WE GOTTA RUN DOWN
EVERYONE THEY SOLD TO.

29:53.290 --> 29:54.416
EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVE?

29:54.460 --> 29:55.586
YEAH?

29:55.620 --> 29:57.258
I'VE GOT THE RESULTS,
BUT SOMETHING'S WEIRD.

29:57.290 --> 29:59.451
WEIRD? WHAT--WHAT IS WEIRD?
WAIT. WHY IS YOUR MASK OFF?

29:59.490 --> 30:01.219
(sighs)
THE DRUGS ARE CLEAN.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.228
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, CLEAN?
NO ANTHRAX.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.421
TESTED THE WHOLE PLACE.
NOT A TRACE.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.165
SORRY, GUYS,
THIS ISN'T YOUR SOURCE.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.167
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

30:08.200 --> 30:09.269
I DON'T KNOW.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.507
BLACKSTONE, SWAREK.
WE GOT IT WRONG.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.303
(Jacob) What the hell you
talking about, we got it wrong?

30:13.340 --> 30:16.309
THE MIDNIGHT HEROIN IS CLEAN.
COMPLETELY CLEAN.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.001
We're back to square one.

30:20.180 --> 30:21.943
(exhales deeply)

30:25.150 --> 30:26.947
(sighs) DOES FRANK KNOW?

30:26.990 --> 30:28.582
NO.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.258
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

30:30.290 --> 30:33.453
I'D BE SUSPENDED
FOR NOT DISCLOSING IT.

30:33.490 --> 30:35.594
THEN I'D HAVE
A SERIES OF TESTS--

30:35.630 --> 30:37.598
PSYCH TESTS,
STRESS TESTS.

30:37.630 --> 30:39.495
BUT THEN THEY COULD
REINSTATE YOU?

30:39.530 --> 30:41.634
YEAH. MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

30:41.670 --> 30:44.036
YEAH, BUT IF YOU'RE
MANAGING IT,

30:44.070 --> 30:46.106
I MEAN, THEY CAN'T FIRE YOU,
CAN THEY?

30:46.140 --> 30:49.075
NO. THEY COULD DO WORSE
THAN THAT.

30:49.110 --> 30:52.170
I COULD SPEND THE REST
OF MY CAREER AT A DESK.

30:52.210 --> 30:55.179
I'D SEE PEOPLE GO OUT
ON THEIR WAY OUT TO SHIFT...

30:55.220 --> 30:56.414
YOU KNOW, THEY'D LOOK AT ME
AND SMILE

30:56.450 --> 30:58.247
AND I'D SEE THE PITY
AND DOUBT.

30:58.290 --> 31:05.184
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GUESS
I'D JUST GET USED TO THAT.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.185
(door opens)

31:06.230 --> 31:08.892
UM, ARE YOU, UH, DECENT?

31:08.930 --> 31:09.897
(Andy) YEP.

31:09.930 --> 31:11.921
AH, GOOD.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.996
OKAY, UH, SO WE'VE GOT
SHOWERS OUTSIDE.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.634
IT'S A, UH,
WATER-SOAP SOLUTION.

31:17.670 --> 31:19.308
UH, NOTHING TOO HARSH.

31:19.340 --> 31:20.978
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
YOU GOTTA WASH THOROUGHLY.

31:21.010 --> 31:23.501
UH, BETWEEN THE TOES.
UNDER THE ARMS.

31:23.540 --> 31:26.475
ALL THE, UM...

31:26.510 --> 31:28.216
FOLDS.
GOT IT, HOWARD.

31:28.250 --> 31:31.913
RIGHT. THEN YOU'LL BE TAKEN
TO HOSPITAL FOR ANTIBIOTICS.

31:31.950 --> 31:33.212
OKAY?

31:36.490 --> 31:39.027
YOU KNOW, UM...

31:39.060 --> 31:43.326
I HAVE NEVER DOUBTED
YOUR ABILITY TO DO THIS JOB.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.497
EVER.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.328
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?

31:47.370 --> 31:49.361
EXACTLY THE SAME.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.234
NO, NO LUCK, DOV.
I'M WITH PATIENT FOUR,

31:56.280 --> 31:58.168
AND SHE'S EVEN WORSE
THAN PATIENT THREE.
(monitor beeping steadily)

31:58.210 --> 32:00.041
(Dov) Same on this end.
Still unconscious.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.240
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, IF ANYTHING CHANGES,

32:01.280 --> 32:03.043
YOU LET ME KNOW, OKAY?

32:03.080 --> 32:04.047
(cell phone beeps)

32:04.090 --> 32:06.183
(sighs)

32:10.720 --> 32:12.654
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF THE MIDNIGHT HEROIN IS CLEAN,

32:12.690 --> 32:13.679
WE'RE FLYING BLIND HERE.

32:13.730 --> 32:15.459
SO WE GOTTA START OVER.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.422
LOOK AT THIS. YOU SEE THIS?
THIS IS HOW GLASGOW STARTED.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.189
FIVE X'S TURN INTO TEN,

32:19.230 --> 32:21.539
TEN INTO A HUNDRED.
BOOM--YOU'VE LOST IT.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.538
YEAH, WE GET IT, ALL RIGHT?
NOTHING LEFT TO DO
BUT BAG BODIES

32:23.570 --> 32:25.709
AND WAIT FOR IT TO CREST.
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN!

32:25.740 --> 32:29.301
ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH.

32:29.340 --> 32:33.049
NOW WE KNOW THESE PEOPLE
ALL HAVE DIRTY DRUGS SOMEWHERE.

32:33.080 --> 32:36.743
SO WE CAMP BY THEIR BEDS
UNTIL THEY WAKE UP.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.849
AND IF THEY DON'T?

32:37.880 --> 32:40.280
'CAUSE EVERY MOMENT THEY
LAY THERE NOT TALKING TO US,

32:40.320 --> 32:41.514
MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.118
THEY DON'T HAVE TO TALK.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.185
(buzzer sounds in distance)

32:45.230 --> 32:47.687
PATIENT FOUR ATTENDED
NATHAN'S ART OPENING.

32:47.730 --> 32:49.595
PATIENT THREE, SAME THING.

32:49.630 --> 32:50.654
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

32:50.700 --> 32:52.565
PARTY STAMPS.
THEY ALL HAVE 'EM.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.363
WE CHECKED.
NATHAN AND JOELLE, TOO.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.267
SO ALL KNOWN VICTIMS
POINT BACK TO THE SAME SOURCE,

32:57.300 --> 32:59.564
TO ONE SOURCE--
NATHAN'S PERSONAL STASH?

32:59.610 --> 33:02.101
YEAH, WHICH TESTED CLEAN
UP THE SUPPLY LINE.

33:02.140 --> 33:04.199
I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.208
UNLESS CONTAMINATION
DIDN'T HAPPEN UP THE LINE,

33:07.250 --> 33:08.012
BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM.

33:08.050 --> 33:11.486
WAIT A MINUTE.
SOMEONE SPIKED IT.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.010
YOU'RE SAYING
THIS WAS ON PURPOSE?

33:13.050 --> 33:14.586
I'M SAYING THIS IS
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.485
BUT WHO WOULD HAVE ACCESS
TO ANTHRAX?

33:16.520 --> 33:18.226
MILITARY RESEARCHERS,
LAB TECHS,

33:18.260 --> 33:19.056
BUT THAT'S LOCKED DOWN TIGHT.

33:19.090 --> 33:20.580
I MEAN,
EVEN IN A NATURAL OUTBREAK,

33:20.630 --> 33:22.222
THE FEDS ARE THERE
IN A HEARTBEAT.

33:22.260 --> 33:23.352
NATURAL OUTBREAK?

33:23.400 --> 33:25.095
YEAH, IT'S RARE,
BUT IT HAPPENS, RIGHT?

33:25.130 --> 33:26.495
UH, CATTLE HERDS, PIGS.

33:26.530 --> 33:28.361
WHAT ABOUT A VETERINARIAN?

33:32.140 --> 33:35.598
(machine beeping steadily)
(sighs)

33:35.640 --> 33:38.609
(ventilator whooshing)

33:38.650 --> 33:40.504
(indistinct conversations)

33:40.550 --> 33:43.371
MR. BANCROFT, WE NEED A WORD.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.581
(Dov) YOU NEED
TO COME WITH US.

33:51.260 --> 33:52.386
THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK

33:52.430 --> 33:54.455
AT A FARM IN MILTON
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.596
AND, UH, I WAS... I WAS PART
OF THE TEAM THAT RESPONDED.

33:58.630 --> 34:01.463
AND YOU SAW
AN OPPORTUNITY TO...

34:01.500 --> 34:03.092
GET NATHAN OUT OF YOUR LIFE?

34:03.140 --> 34:05.267
NO. NOI NO. NO.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.800
OUT OF JOELLE'S LIFE.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.434
RIGHT. YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO LOSE HER.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.243
NO.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.147
(chuckles)

34:14.180 --> 34:15.818
SHE COULDN'T LET HIM GO.

34:18.750 --> 34:22.208
YOU EVER HAD TO WATCH THAT?

34:22.260 --> 34:24.421
YOU EVER HAVE TO WATCH
THE WOMAN THAT YOU--YOU LOVE

34:24.460 --> 34:27.657
JUST BEING SLOWLY
BLED DRY

34:27.690 --> 34:31.399
FINANCIALLY,
EMOTIONALLY, AND...

34:31.430 --> 34:33.421
THAT MAN IS A PARASITE.

34:33.470 --> 34:35.358
WELL, HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO GOT HURT, WAS HE?

34:37.570 --> 34:41.131
LOOK...

34:41.180 --> 34:44.343
NO ONE ELSE
WAS SUPPOSED TO GET HURT.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.749
I JUST TALKED
TO THE HOSPITAL.

34:52.790 --> 34:55.486
HIS WIFE'S DOING BETTER.
SHE'S GONNA PULL THROUGH.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.158
TH E OTH ERS?

34:57.190 --> 34:59.624
TOO SOON TO TELL.

34:59.660 --> 35:02.891
NO, THAT'S IT, FOR SURE.
JUST LIKE THAT? THANKS, DOUG.

35:02.930 --> 35:05.592
ALL RIGHT.
KID HAD THE STAMP.

35:05.630 --> 35:08.497
HE WAS AT THE GALLERY OPENING.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.893
WE OWE YOU BIG TIME,
CEDRIC.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.238
I MEAN, IF THAT GUY
HAD STAYED THERE MUCH LONGER,

35:12.270 --> 35:13.532
SOMEONE COULD HAVE GOT
SEVERELY SICK.

35:13.570 --> 35:14.901
OR EVEN WORSE.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.476
CAN--CAN YOU HELP ME OUT
A LITTLE?

35:16.510 --> 35:18.205
OH, YOU KNOW
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.808
(car door closes)

35:19.850 --> 35:22.842
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU DROPPED $20

35:22.880 --> 35:24.643
IN THE BACK
OF THE SQUAD CAR, RIGHT?

35:24.690 --> 35:27.181
APPRECIATE THAT.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.313
(man) OKAY, GUYS.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.452
(horn blares in distance)
WHAT?

35:30.490 --> 35:33.653
I'M THINKING OF THE, UH,
FIRST O.D. CALL I TOOK YOU ON.

35:33.690 --> 35:36.397
REMEMBER THE SQUAT
AT SIMCO?

35:36.430 --> 35:38.227
OH, THE ONE
WITH THE BATHROOM.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.567
OH. (exhales deeply)

35:39.600 --> 35:41.295
YEP. YOU WOULDN'T LOOK
ANYONE IN THE EYE.

35:44.540 --> 35:47.907

36:16.300 --> 36:18.404
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S SO IRRITATING?

36:18.440 --> 36:20.533
IS I'D CONVINCED MYSELF
THAT YOU WEREN'T A COWARD.

36:20.570 --> 36:21.673
WELL, I'M NOT A COWARD.

36:21.710 --> 36:24.907
I JUST THINK THINGS ARE
A LITTLE COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.838
WHAT, WITH FRANK?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.745
YEAH, FRANK...

36:42.430 --> 36:44.625

36:46.830 --> 36:49.537
DOV, WHO TOLD YOU
I WAS BIPOLAR?

36:49.570 --> 36:50.764
NO ONE,
BUT I FOUND SOME PILLS

36:50.800 --> 36:52.301
AFTER YOU DROPPED YOUR BAG
THIS MORNING.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.967
OH, AND YOU JUST ASSUMED
THAT THEY WERE MINE?

36:54.010 --> 36:55.830
I DON'T KNOW. YOU TRANSFERRED
FROM 27 DIVISION,

36:55.880 --> 36:57.734
YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING IN YOUR BAG.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.975
IT ALL SEEMED...
TO ADD UP.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.672
(sighs) YOU HAVE BEEN SCARED
OF THIS FROM THE START,

37:02.720 --> 37:05.518
AND THIS WAS JUST
YOUR PERFECT OUT.

37:05.550 --> 37:06.881
(sighs)

37:06.920 --> 37:10.583
OH, AND HERE--

37:23.770 --> 37:27.399

ABOUT THIS, EITHER.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.305
IT'S PRIVATE.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.308
CAN I COUNT ON YOU
TO RESPECT THAT?

37:31.350 --> 37:33.375
YEAH. OF COURSE.

FOR SECONDS. I'M FINE, SAM.

37:58.810 --> 37:59.936
HUH?

37:59.970 --> 38:02.404
(Traci laughs)

38:02.440 --> 38:03.270

38:03.310 --> 38:05.301
THE DEADLY BACTERIA
OR THE COMPANY?

38:05.350 --> 38:07.306

38:13.720 --> 38:16.553

OOH-HOO! (laughs)

38:27.830 --> 38:28.865

38:28.900 --> 38:32.802

and speaking indistinctly)

38:32.840 --> 38:35.934
(indistinct conversations)

38:35.980 --> 38:37.072
HEY, GOOD NIGHT, DIAZ.

38:37.110 --> 38:38.805

38:50.790 --> 38:52.758
WHY DIDN'T--WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

38:52.790 --> 38:54.826
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE KIND OF BEEN
SAYING GOOD-BYE FOR WEEKS,

38:54.860 --> 38:57.852
SO I FIGURED IT'D JUST BE EASIER
IF I, YOU KNOW, SLIPPED OUT.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.367

AN OUTDOOR SCREENING RIGHT NOW,

39:38.470 --> 39:41.109

TOUCHING.

39:41.140 --> 39:42.573
OH, STOP.

39:42.610 --> 39:43.702
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING,

39:43.740 --> 39:47.801
I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE
THERE WOULD BE TOUCHING.

39:47.850 --> 39:49.943
**

39:49.980 --> 39:53.040
WITH BOTH HANDS.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.055
I'M SORRY?
(sets down glass)

40:03.100 --> 40:05.967
(chuckles) SENDING PEOPLE
OFF TO PLAY HOUSE--

40:06.000 --> 40:07.968
DO YOU GET A KICK
OUT OF IT?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.069
BECAUSE IT'S KINDA LIKE A--

40:09.100 --> 40:11.432
IT'S KINDA LIKE
A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.

40:11.470 --> 40:13.961
ARE THEY GONNA FIGHT?
ARE THEY GONNA KISS?

40:14.010 --> 40:15.932
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
THE, UH,

40:15.980 --> 40:17.629

40:17.680 --> 40:20.547
NO, WHAT IS THE TROUBLE?
WELL, YOU GET ANSWERS,

40:20.580 --> 40:23.117

40:30.760 --> 40:33.479
I WANT YOU...

40:33.530 --> 40:38.797

BE STRAIGHT WITH ME, PLEASE.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.858
SO YOU WANNA KNOW

40:42.900 --> 40:45.801
BETWEEN MCNALLY AND COLLINS?
I DON'T KNOW.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.967
THAT'S THE TRUTH,
BUT I DON'T...

40:48.010 --> 40:50.205
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS,
PECK,

40:50.240 --> 40:52.242

40:52.280 --> 40:54.009
AND I THINK REALLY
WHAT'S ONLY--

40:54.050 --> 40:55.142
THE ONLY THING LEFT
FOR YOU TO DECIDE

40:55.180 --> 40:57.842

GONNA DO ABOUT IT, SO...
