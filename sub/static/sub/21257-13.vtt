(gasps)
Julia!

00:12.680 --> 00:13.847
Thomas!

00:13.881 --> 00:15.183
(both)
Mwah, mwah.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.650
Grateful for your presence.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.419
Wow.
Quick energy scan.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.987
You are radiating toxicity.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.021
(sighs)
I know.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.556
I am so stressed out
at work right now.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.492
I'm in way over my head.
What?

00:24.525 --> 00:27.728
I hear you are killing it
over at "Big Little Life."

00:27.761 --> 00:29.530
Shailene Woodley wouldn't even
have a lifestyle magazine

00:29.563 --> 00:31.665
if it wasn't for you.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.001
But now they want me to write
my own feature,

00:34.034 --> 00:36.404
and I have no idea
what to cover.

00:36.437 --> 00:40.341
I am so tense right now,
it is literally killing me.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.376
Well, then we're gonna flush
the negative toxins

00:42.410 --> 00:45.045
right out of you before
they do any more damage.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.681
Mm-kay, here's what
I'm gonna sign you up for.

00:47.715 --> 00:51.252
A full-body energy cleanse,
a gemstone colon scrub,

00:51.285 --> 00:52.886
a chakra meditation class,

00:52.920 --> 00:54.755
and a comprehensive
third-eye exam.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.224
Oh, my gosh, yes!

00:56.257 --> 00:59.360
And I wanna do some of these
antitoxin footpads right here.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.396
(both)
Grateful for your presence.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.731

01:07.168 --> 01:08.402
(sighs)

01:08.436 --> 01:12.540
This detox is going
to work wonders.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.576
Hi, Julia.
No, it won't.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.411
At least not the way
you think it will.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.880
Are you here
to encourage mindfulness?

01:19.913 --> 01:22.250
Eh, more like critical thinking.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.251
Namaste!

01:23.284 --> 01:24.552
I'm Adam Conover,

01:24.585 --> 01:27.655
and this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:27.688 --> 01:29.223
Ah!

01:36.764 --> 01:39.233
If you don't believe this stuff,
why are you here?

01:39.267 --> 01:41.169
Oh, I come to the spa
to debunk things.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.437
(giggling)
It really relaxes me.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.105
Okay, well,
speak your truth quickly

01:45.139 --> 01:46.674
because I am not missing
my cleanse.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.842
I am full of toxins.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.979
Ah, yes!
Good old, bad old toxins.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.182
The wellness industry tells us
they're terrifying,

01:54.215 --> 01:55.983
they're inside of us,
and we need

01:56.016 --> 01:58.419
their high-priced help
to get 'em out.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.953
Is your blood toxic?

01:59.987 --> 02:02.756
Toxic blood can affect
every organ in your body,

02:02.790 --> 02:04.992
and it's happening
to millions of people.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.794
If you're feeling tired
and bloated,

02:06.827 --> 02:08.596
then Lee Haney's
seven-day detox program

02:08.629 --> 02:10.198
is just what you need.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.933
(announcer)
Detox Foot Pads will restore
balance to your body,

02:12.966 --> 02:15.135
stimulate your system,
draw out toxins,

02:15.169 --> 02:16.870
improve your blood circulation.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.706
You'll feel rejuvenated.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.608
But the truth is,
that's an all-natural...

02:20.641 --> 02:22.543
(glass shatters)
Herbal-strength myth.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.212
No way.
These things work.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.813
Look.

02:25.846 --> 02:26.947
(footpad rips)

02:26.980 --> 02:28.682
That's toxins.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.885
Nope!
That's color-changing fabric.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.322
And a straight-up scam.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.990
(tense musical sting)

02:37.024 --> 02:39.126
Despite what
wellness companies say,

02:39.159 --> 02:42.330
as a matter of basic physiology,
it's pretty much impossible

02:42.363 --> 02:45.065
to suck toxins out
through your skin.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.168
Well, then I'll just sweat them
out in the steam room.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.970
Also not possible.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.506
I'm never one to turn down
a nice shvitz,

02:52.540 --> 02:57.645
but ask a scientist and they'll
tell you sweat is...

02:57.678 --> 02:59.079
(beeping and chimes)

02:59.112 --> 03:01.415
99% water.

03:01.449 --> 03:04.017
Sweat is your body's
temperature control,

03:04.051 --> 03:05.353
and that's it.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.688
Detox just isn't
your skin's job.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.823
Okay, then I'll just drink
a ton of water.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.260
Hydration is great
for flushing toxins out.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.362
Sorry!
Science says, "Nope!"

03:14.395 --> 03:15.729
(steam hissing)

03:15.763 --> 03:17.030
(bottle clatters on floor)

03:17.064 --> 03:18.366
What about massages?

03:18.399 --> 03:20.234
Deep breathing?
Cupping?

03:20.268 --> 03:21.869
Please tell me cupping works,
in the name of all

03:21.902 --> 03:24.037
that is Chrissy Teigan.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.506
(pops)

03:25.539 --> 03:27.040
What?

03:27.074 --> 03:29.743
So how do I get toxins out
of me?

03:29.777 --> 03:31.412
I've been stress-eating
fast food

03:31.445 --> 03:33.714
and touching plastic all week
trying to finish this article,

03:33.747 --> 03:36.016
and now there are evil,
little particles inside of me

03:36.049 --> 03:37.285
and they're slowly killing me.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.553
Ah!
Graphics have toxins too.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.888
Hate to burst your bubble,

03:40.921 --> 03:42.790
but that's not how
it works at all.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.527
The fact is, toxins aren't even
a special type of chemical.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.630
It's just become
a trendy buzzword.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.232
The truth is that anything
can be toxic

03:52.266 --> 03:54.034
if you ingest too much of it.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.705
Eat too much vitamin C?
That's a toxin.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.941
Overdose on fiber?
Uh, that's a toxin!

04:00.974 --> 04:02.610
Drink too much water?
You better believe--

04:02.643 --> 04:04.945
I get it!
Okay.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.415
Luckily, your body comes
naturally equipped

04:07.448 --> 04:10.651
with the world's
most effective detox products.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.785
Your internal organs!

04:11.819 --> 04:12.986
(dramatic musical sting)

04:13.020 --> 04:14.788
Footpads were
a lot less gross.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.758
If you have harmful levels
of a substance in your body,

04:17.791 --> 04:21.261
your liver, kidneys,
and lungs naturally filter it,

04:21.295 --> 04:24.432
and then flush it out
in your pee-pee and poo-poo.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.166
(toilet flushing)
Um, weird that you call it that.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.502
But wait,
if toxins come out in my...

04:28.536 --> 04:30.571
Pee-pee and poo-poo.
Then I will just--

04:30.604 --> 04:33.240
I'll speed that up.
I will get a colon cleanse.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.943
Oh, no.
Not that.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.747
Your impacted fecal matter is
causing a lot of toxic blockage,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.650
so we'll gently flush it out
by shooting 15 gallons of water

04:42.683 --> 04:43.684
up your rectum.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.118
Perf.
Let's do it.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.987
Julia, please don't do this.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.288
(groans)
Why not?

04:48.322 --> 04:50.991
My friend Basil said getting
a colonic was life-changing.

04:51.024 --> 04:54.995
Well, if you ask any doctor,
they'll tell you...

04:55.028 --> 04:57.965
Colon cleanses are damaging
to your intestinal health,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.667
and can even be dangerous.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.470
Oh, Julia,
this is Dr. Gerry Mullin.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.305
He's a gastroenterologist
at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.475
I came as fast as I could.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.110
Julia, some people think
that colon cleanses

05:10.143 --> 05:12.380
flush toxic matter out
of the gut.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.949
However, there is absolutely
no scientific evidence

05:15.983 --> 05:18.486
that high colonics are good
for your health.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.655
The only thing
they have been proven to cause

05:21.689 --> 05:24.458
are awful side effects
such as nausea

05:24.492 --> 05:26.159
and vomiting and cramping.

05:26.193 --> 05:29.162
Then how am I supposed
to get all of that old--

05:29.196 --> 05:30.498
you know--
out of me?

05:30.531 --> 05:31.832
You don't need to.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.367
If you have
regular bowel movements,

05:33.401 --> 05:36.303
your fecal matter is expelled
often enough.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.171
And you don't want
to force-flush excrement

05:38.205 --> 05:39.473
out of your colon.

05:39.507 --> 05:42.309
Fecal matter nourishes
and protects your bowels.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.844
Your body's like a garden.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.647
You want some fertilizer
in there.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.516
Aww, gross.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.917
Thanks, Dr. Mullin.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.151
No problem.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.486
And if you need me again,

05:52.520 --> 05:54.254
just turn on the butt signal.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.758
**

05:57.791 --> 06:01.261
It's like the bat signal
but for gastroenterologists.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.396
See ya.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.831
(flatulence)

06:03.864 --> 06:05.666
**

06:05.699 --> 06:07.334
Eww.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.037
The fact is, you don't need
expensive products

06:10.070 --> 06:12.039
and treatments
to cleanse your toxins.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.942
Your body does a fine job
of that naturally.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.610
The only thing
this place cleanses

06:16.644 --> 06:19.580
is money from your wallet.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.415
(cash register bell dings)
Grateful for your presence.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.350
(Julia gasps)
Thomas!

06:23.383 --> 06:25.586
What the F?
Sorry.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.055
Complimentary clean juice?
Yes.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.691
Thank you.
Mmm.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.560
Mmm, I feel better already.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.727
I really need to get back

06:33.761 --> 06:35.362
on that clean eating program
you recommended.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.064
You know the one
that's like no chemicals,

06:37.097 --> 06:39.299
no gluten,
and definitely no MSG?

06:39.332 --> 06:42.135
Oh, I've gotta tell you
the truth about MSG!

06:42.169 --> 06:44.137
You are a human toxin.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.106
**

06:49.109 --> 06:51.745
**

06:51.779 --> 06:54.982
And another deep breath in...

06:55.015 --> 06:56.817
(inhales slowly)

06:56.850 --> 06:58.285
And out.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.286
(exhales slowly)

06:59.319 --> 07:01.589
**

07:01.622 --> 07:03.457
Mmm.

07:03.491 --> 07:08.295
Nothing but pure green tea,
grapes, and tomatoes.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.563
Mmm.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.933
It's all natural,
and best of all, no MSG.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.435
Oh, MSG is nothing
to be afraid of.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.070
Um, no.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.239
MSG is a dangerous chemical.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.509
It was our October cover story
for Halloween.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.511
(woman screaming)

07:23.544 --> 07:25.078
Well, then your magazine
is totally...

07:25.112 --> 07:26.179
(chime ringing)

07:26.213 --> 07:28.849
And everyone shut up now.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.751
No talking.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.320
Just breathe in
all the misconceptions...

07:33.353 --> 07:34.822
(inhales sharply)

07:34.855 --> 07:38.659
And breathe out your desire
to debunk them.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.460
(dramatic music swells)

07:40.494 --> 07:44.532
The idea that MSG is dangerous
is a total myth!

07:44.565 --> 07:46.534
I don't want MSG
anywhere near me!

07:46.567 --> 07:47.801
And you're not alone.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.704
For about 50 years,
Americans have put MSG

07:50.738 --> 07:52.973
in culinary quarantine.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.808
There are anti-MSG cookbooks,

07:54.842 --> 07:57.010
companies declare "No MSG"
on their packaging,

07:57.044 --> 07:59.980
and if you even whisper "MSG"
near a restaurant...

08:00.013 --> 08:02.182
We do not use MSG!

08:02.215 --> 08:05.485
But the fact is,
MSG is a harmless chemical

08:05.519 --> 08:07.621
called monosodium glutamate.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.558
**

08:10.591 --> 08:11.859
Exactly.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.461
I don't put anything in my body
I can't pronounce.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.496
Oh, so you wouldn't drink this?

08:16.530 --> 08:18.666
**

08:18.699 --> 08:20.167
Dihydrogen monoxide?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.002
Sounds like something they'd use
to clean the floors

08:22.035 --> 08:24.638
after they butcher baby cows
in a factory farm.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.207
It is,
if you mean water.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.009
(water sloshing)

08:29.042 --> 08:32.512
Every substance has an
unpronounceable chemical name,

08:32.546 --> 08:34.848
and in MSG's case,
that name tells you

08:34.882 --> 08:38.418
it's just one sodium ion
from ordinary table salt added

08:38.451 --> 08:41.021
to an amino acid
called glutamate,

08:41.054 --> 08:42.022
which is one of the major

08:42.055 --> 08:43.691
building blocks of protein.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.159
It's found in tons
of plants and animals,

08:46.193 --> 08:48.562
and your own body
actually produces it.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.031
It's totally natural.
Really?

08:51.064 --> 08:52.866
Then why is everyone
so petrified of it?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.568
I mean, there has to be
a reason.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.504
Oh, there is,
and it's real crazy.

08:57.537 --> 09:01.408
(Adam)
In 1908, a Japanese chemist
named Kikunae Ikeda decided

09:01.441 --> 09:05.412
to isolate a flavor he loved
in soup called "umami."

09:05.445 --> 09:09.850
Ooh! Mommy!
I love umami!

09:09.883 --> 09:13.053
Umami is what chef's call
"the fifth taste."

09:13.086 --> 09:15.088
It's that savory,
chicken brothy--

09:15.122 --> 09:19.092
Oh, umami is very on trend.
We covered it in our May issue.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.394
Well, Ikeda isolated
the compound responsible

09:21.428 --> 09:24.031
for that tasty umami flavor--
glutamate--

09:24.064 --> 09:26.033
added salt, and...

09:26.066 --> 09:28.468
Eureka!
MSG!

09:28.501 --> 09:30.604
(Adam)
His invention was revolutionary.

09:30.638 --> 09:35.242
MSG was a magic bullet that made
all savory food taste better.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.910
Campbell's put it
in their soups.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.913
Buddhist monks even used it
in their vegetarian food.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.649
Mmm, delicious!

09:41.682 --> 09:42.983
(gasps)
Crap!

09:43.016 --> 09:44.484
My vow of silence.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.921
Well, if it's so natural
monks eat it...

09:47.955 --> 09:50.958
Oh, goop!
That's really good!

09:50.991 --> 09:54.427
Yeah, and you've been
avoiding it for no good reason.

09:54.461 --> 09:58.231
The fabricated flavor fear
started in 1968,

09:58.265 --> 10:01.268
when one doctor wrote one
little opinion letter

10:01.301 --> 10:03.170
to "The New England Journal
of Medicine."

10:14.815 --> 10:16.283
(typewriter bell dings)

10:16.316 --> 10:17.617
(gasps)

10:17.651 --> 10:20.020
The letter went viral,
and even though

10:20.053 --> 10:22.790
all types of restaurants
were using MSG,

10:22.823 --> 10:24.624
frightened Americans
only associated

10:24.658 --> 10:28.929
the supposed "syndrome"
with Chinese restaurants.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.364
I've got
Chinese Restaurant Syndrome!

10:31.398 --> 10:32.966
MSG might harm youth!

10:33.000 --> 10:34.634
Chinese food make you--

10:34.668 --> 10:37.771
Wow, even for the '70s,
this is pretty racist.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.472
Holy crow.
Yeah.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.142
And unfortunately,
all of those were real.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.344
But all that panic
was for nothing,

10:44.377 --> 10:46.346
because, after 50 years
of research,

10:46.379 --> 10:48.816
the FDA finally concluded...

10:48.849 --> 10:50.483
We were never able to confirm

10:50.517 --> 10:53.887
that the MSG caused
the reported effects.

10:53.921 --> 10:57.124
In fact, no one has ever
consistently established

10:57.157 --> 11:00.627
a link between MSG consumption
and those symptoms.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.663
Okay, but I do get headaches
every time I eat Chinese food.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.734
I feel one coming on right now.
That monk tricked me.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.236
Actually, that headache
is all in your head.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.371
I mean,
more than most headaches.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.174
The scientific consensus
is that MSG sensitivity

11:14.207 --> 11:16.509
is a psychological phenomenon.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.412
Case in point, you've actually
been eating glutamate all day

11:19.446 --> 11:21.882
without even realizing it.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.217
Glutamate is found naturally
in tomatoes,

11:24.251 --> 11:25.919
green tea, mushrooms,

11:25.953 --> 11:30.090
steak, cheese, soy sauce,
grape juice, kimchi,

11:30.123 --> 11:31.892
even breast milk.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.861
But I've been drinking
green tea, grape,

11:33.894 --> 11:36.563
and tomato juice all day,
and I didn't get a headache

11:36.596 --> 11:38.065
until I ate that monk's food.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.432
Exactly.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.769
If you believe
that MSG causes headaches,

11:41.802 --> 11:43.436
then you'll experience one
just because

11:43.470 --> 11:45.005
you think you've eaten it.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.907
Chinese food doesn't cause
these symptoms.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.375
Our fear of it does.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.711
MSG is just a victim
of a half a century

11:51.745 --> 11:54.014
of xenophobia
and bad press.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.750
It's always been safe
and delicious.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.219
So I've been drinking
this garbage

11:59.252 --> 12:03.056
and avoiding Chinese food
for no reason?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.925
Yup!
Hmm.

12:04.958 --> 12:05.926
(bottle clatters)
Great.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.761
(Julia sighs)

12:07.795 --> 12:09.562
Feel better?
No.

12:09.596 --> 12:12.065
I feel worse.
Detoxing is a hoax.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.067
MSG is a wonder spice.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.903
Breathe, Julia.
You know what?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.270
You have options.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.572
Crystals.
Magnets.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.208
Crystal magnets.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.143
Oh, I can feel it
working already.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.779
Oh, those things have no
physical healing effect at all.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.781
The only reason you feel
like they do is because

12:27.815 --> 12:30.750
of one of the strangest
mind control forces of Earth.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.586
(thunder booming)
(laughs maniacally)

12:33.620 --> 12:35.455
(scoffs)

12:35.488 --> 12:36.990
What?
Too much?

12:40.660 --> 12:43.330
(groans)
Thomas, my neck
is still killing me.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.932
I need the works.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.100
Salt lamps, crystals...

12:47.134 --> 12:48.936
Moonstones,
essential oils.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.104
I'll give you
the friends and family discount.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.973
You are a prince.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.507
(cash register bell dinging)

12:54.541 --> 12:57.444
Whoa!
Those are some pricey placebos!

12:57.477 --> 13:00.447
Thomas, darling, do you have
anything that will cleanse me

13:00.480 --> 13:02.115
of annoying blond men?

13:02.149 --> 13:04.351
Oh!

13:04.384 --> 13:06.386
Be gone.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.924
Adam, you don't know
what you're talking about.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.760
Crystals and energy healing
actually work.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.129
A placebo is when a doctor
gives you a fake sugar pill

13:16.163 --> 13:17.965
instead of real medicine,
and you think

13:17.998 --> 13:20.167
that you're getting better,
but it's just in your head.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.869
Oh, no, the placebo effect

13:21.902 --> 13:24.137
is far stronger
than most people think.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.805
(chuckles)

13:25.839 --> 13:28.808
New studies are finding it can
do such incredible things,

13:28.842 --> 13:31.879
it's almost like magic.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.113
Welcome!

13:33.146 --> 13:36.083
I am The Great Placeboni!

13:37.484 --> 13:39.719
Placeboni!

13:39.752 --> 13:42.890
Plus, I'm a magician
who uses placebos!

13:42.923 --> 13:45.558
And today's show features

13:45.592 --> 13:48.661
a special guest appearance by...

13:48.695 --> 13:51.164
Dr. Kathryn Hall!

13:51.198 --> 13:54.667
Ooh, she's a molecular biologist
and Director of Placebo Genetics

13:54.701 --> 13:57.670
at Harvard Medical School's
Program in Placebo Studies.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.172
Nice to be here.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.041
Placebos work so mysteriously,

14:01.074 --> 14:05.178
sometimes they might seem
almost... unbelievable.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.215
(Dr. Hall)
In one study, scientists gave
a group of asthma patients

14:08.248 --> 14:10.750
an inhaler with real medicine
and compared them

14:10.783 --> 14:13.853
to another group of patients
that were given placebos.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.755
**

14:15.788 --> 14:18.325
(Adam)
And after the treatment,
all groups reported

14:18.358 --> 14:20.928
about a 50% improvement.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.030
Behold!

14:23.063 --> 14:24.564
**

14:24.597 --> 14:27.367
So air is a miracle drug.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.069
It made people breathe better.

14:29.102 --> 14:32.105
No, there was no physical effect
on their bodies,

14:32.139 --> 14:34.041
but the placebo effect
made them feel

14:34.074 --> 14:35.575
like they could breathe better.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.611
And the next study
is even stranger.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.713
For our next trick,
we'll use the placebo effect

14:40.747 --> 14:45.285
to manipulate the way people
perform on cognitive tests!

14:45.318 --> 14:48.388
In this study, researchers told
one group of participants

14:48.421 --> 14:50.557
that brain wave analysis showed
that they had gotten

14:50.590 --> 14:52.059
a great night's sleep.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.594
And they told the other group
that their brain wave analysis

14:54.627 --> 14:56.129
showed that they
had slept poorly,

14:56.163 --> 14:58.531
and then they were given
a cognitive test.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.400
Wow, you slept great.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.634
(bell dings)

15:01.668 --> 15:03.470
You're gonna ace this test.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.239
Regardless of how well they
thought they'd actually slept,

15:06.273 --> 15:08.741
participants who were told
they got a good night's sleep

15:08.775 --> 15:10.710
scored better on the tests
than those

15:10.743 --> 15:12.912
who were told
they slept poorly.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.381
**

15:14.414 --> 15:16.449
A perfect score!

15:16.483 --> 15:19.152
Usually magic is such
a turn-off, but this is great.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.287
Oh, it's not magic.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.122
It's the placebo effect!
Shh!

15:22.155 --> 15:23.456
Adam, you're gonna ruin
the show.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.092
If the patient finds out
it's a placebo,

15:25.125 --> 15:26.259
it won't work anymore.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.594
(Dr. Hall)
Actually, it will.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.997
Studies have shown
that even if you know

15:30.030 --> 15:32.299
you're taking a placebo...

15:32.332 --> 15:33.633
(stomach rumbling)

15:33.666 --> 15:35.902
Simply going to a doctor
and getting a prescription

15:35.935 --> 15:40.107
can actually make you feel...
better!

15:40.140 --> 15:41.474
Wowza.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.743
My bowels feel
less irritable already.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.979
**

15:46.013 --> 15:48.581
So the placebo effect
can cure diseases.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.918
No, the placebo effect can't
physically shrink a tumor

15:51.951 --> 15:54.121
or lower your cholesterol,
but sometimes,

15:54.154 --> 15:55.955
like in the case
of that guy's IBS,

15:55.989 --> 15:58.992
it can improve
physical symptoms.

15:59.026 --> 16:03.596
And for our final trick,
Dr. Hall and The Great Placeboni

16:03.630 --> 16:07.367
will alleviate the symptoms
of... Parkinson's!

16:07.400 --> 16:08.801
(tiger growling)

16:08.835 --> 16:12.139
**

16:12.172 --> 16:15.142
(Dr. Hall)
One study found that placebos
could actually alleviate

16:15.175 --> 16:17.210
some of the symptoms
of Parkinson's disease.

16:17.244 --> 16:20.313
Placebos increased
dopamine levels in the brain,

16:20.347 --> 16:25.352
causing symptoms like
uncontrollable shaking to...

16:25.385 --> 16:26.819
Diminish!

16:26.853 --> 16:27.887
(cat meows)

16:27.920 --> 16:30.190
(cheers and applause)

16:30.223 --> 16:31.291
**

16:31.324 --> 16:32.825
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.161
Wow.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.662
Now, let's be clear.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.997
These patients
still have Parkinson's,

16:38.031 --> 16:40.333
but even though the treatment
was a placebo,

16:40.367 --> 16:42.001
some of the patients
that received it

16:42.035 --> 16:43.636
still saw some improvement.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.672
The effect was even visible
on their brain scans.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.243
Wow, I had no idea

16:50.277 --> 16:52.745
that the placebo effect
was so powerful.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.481
Yup, and it explains a lot

16:54.514 --> 16:56.349
of your favorite
wellness products too.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.051
Wait, what?
No.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.986
Even though a lot
of wellness treatments

17:00.019 --> 17:02.189
have very little scientific
evidence behind them,

17:02.222 --> 17:04.691
they often still feel
like they work.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.060
Why? Because they're
particularly adept

17:07.094 --> 17:09.362
at taking advantage
of the placebo effect.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.530
But this is different.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.199
I mean,
Thomas is a professional.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.202
Right, and the placebo effect
seems to have something to do

17:15.235 --> 17:17.704
with the authority
of who's giving it out.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.372
(Adam)
And you'll notice
wellness practitioners

17:19.406 --> 17:22.409
tend to wear uniforms
and have diplomas on the wall.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.011
Ritual and aesthetics
also play a role,

17:25.044 --> 17:28.014
thus the ambient music,
the candles,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.616
and the hot towels.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.952
And more expensive prices
can increase the effect.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.387
(cash register bell dinging)

17:34.421 --> 17:35.722
Think about it.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.592
Everything in here takes
advantage of the placebo effect.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.294
Isn't that incredible?

17:41.328 --> 17:43.230
Uh-oh.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.064
Something's wrong.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.300
Everything that made me
feel better is useless,

17:47.334 --> 17:51.238
and I feel really stupid.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.407
I hope you're happy, Adam.
(crystal clatters on floor)

17:54.441 --> 17:57.577
So not grateful
for your presence.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.479
**

18:03.316 --> 18:04.717
Ah!
Julia!

18:04.751 --> 18:07.320
You know you locked yourself
in the supply closet, right?

18:07.354 --> 18:08.921
I know where I am.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.957
If I can't get
the chemicals out of me,

18:10.990 --> 18:14.627
I may as well just move in
with them.

18:14.661 --> 18:19.399
You're my only friend now...
isopropyl alcohol.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.301
Are you okay?
No!

18:21.334 --> 18:24.971
My neck hurts, and I'm never
gonna get my article done

18:25.004 --> 18:26.573
because everything
that makes me feel better

18:26.606 --> 18:28.641
is a placebo scam!

18:28.675 --> 18:30.977
I hope you're proud
of yourself, Adam,

18:31.010 --> 18:33.613
'cause you just debunked me
into a lot of pain!

18:33.646 --> 18:35.348
No.
Look.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.184
You've got it all wrong.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.752
The fact that all these
treatments are placebos means

18:39.786 --> 18:44.757
that in a very real sense
they can help.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.992
Really?

18:46.025 --> 18:47.994
Absolutely.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.829
Used properly,
placebos can have

18:49.862 --> 18:53.300
a real therapeutic benefit.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.034
Even traditional medicine
takes advantage

18:55.067 --> 18:56.503
of the placebo response.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.605
When a doctor sees you
in their office

18:58.638 --> 19:02.108
and listens to your concerns,
that ritual of care is part

19:02.141 --> 19:04.977
of what helps you feel better,
especially if you're dealing

19:05.011 --> 19:07.214
with unhealthy stress
and despair.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.648
And even though
wellness treatments

19:08.681 --> 19:10.049
may not cure diseases,

19:10.082 --> 19:13.320
their rituals can have
those same beneficial effects.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.155
You're in good hands.
We're gonna take care of you.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.357
Huh.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.391
The most important thing is

19:18.425 --> 19:20.227
that you listen to your body

19:20.260 --> 19:22.161
and do what works best for you.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.863
In my research,
we're actually finding

19:23.896 --> 19:25.665
that some people
have stronger responses

19:25.698 --> 19:28.000
to placebo treatment
than others.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.070
It can be enhanced by
your genetic predispositions,

19:31.103 --> 19:33.172
your beliefs about
the healthcare system,

19:33.206 --> 19:34.674
even your personality.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.176
What's even more exciting
is that it appears

19:37.210 --> 19:41.248
that some drugs can block
and mimic the placebo response.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.416
So in a clinical trial,
it makes it really hard

19:43.450 --> 19:45.718
to tell if that drug
is better than placebo

19:45.752 --> 19:47.420
or placebo is better than drug.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.155
It's an incredibly
exciting time

19:49.188 --> 19:50.757
in our understanding
of the human body.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.525
That's incredible.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.995
Now, it's crucial not to neglect
traditional medicine.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.697
You still need to go
to your doctor

19:57.730 --> 19:59.699
and discuss all
of your treatment options.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.435
But if you feel like
you're getting some benefit

20:02.469 --> 20:04.604
from wellness treatments,
there's no harm

20:04.637 --> 20:06.273
in pursuing them too.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.875
Yeah, go ahead.
Salt-scrub your stress out.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.077
Put a crystal in your candle,
why don't ya?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.045
Okay, thanks, Dr. Hall.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.547
No problem.

20:14.581 --> 20:18.951
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some relaxing to do.

20:18.985 --> 20:22.054
Oh, and, uh, here.
Think you might want this?

20:22.088 --> 20:24.056
(sighing)
Oh, I know it's a placebo,

20:24.090 --> 20:27.560
but it really does make me feel
so much better.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.529
Wait!
Wait, Adam.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.564
That's my article!
Oh, my God!

20:31.598 --> 20:33.733
I would kiss you,
but I think of you more

20:33.766 --> 20:37.036
as like a little brother
or like a human pamphlet.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.071
(giggles)
That's okay.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.740
I have a girlfriend!

20:40.773 --> 20:44.076
And we've kissed... twice.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.914
**

20:47.947 --> 20:51.784
(gasps)
Mail for me!

20:51.818 --> 20:54.754
Huh.
I don't subscribe to...

20:54.787 --> 20:56.389
**

20:56.423 --> 20:59.459
"Grateful for your presence.
Julia."

20:59.492 --> 21:01.761
(clicks tongue)
Aww.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.297
"Round Glasses are Bad Now"?

21:04.331 --> 21:05.832
Oh, man!

21:05.865 --> 21:06.966
**

21:09.536 --> 21:12.171
**

21:12.204 --> 21:14.441
Hello, I'm here on set
on "Adam Ruins Everything"

21:14.474 --> 21:15.675
'cause I got way more questions

21:15.708 --> 21:18.277
for Dr. Gerry Mullin
about his work.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.979
So let's talk about
colon cleanses.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.449
How did this become
such a trendy procedure?

21:22.482 --> 21:24.617
Well, some celebs start doing it

21:24.651 --> 21:26.285
and actually start boasting

21:26.319 --> 21:27.820
about its benefits.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.289
And then the spas,
that becomes part

21:30.323 --> 21:32.792
of the package to appeal
to cleanse

21:32.825 --> 21:36.028
and detox and renew
and rejuvenate.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.498
It grew off the legs
of the holistic movement...

21:38.531 --> 21:41.868
Mm-hmm.
But it may not be
the best part of it.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.302
So it sounds like one
of the big problems

21:43.336 --> 21:45.972
with the colon cleanses is that
they flush out your microbiome,

21:46.005 --> 21:47.807
which I've heard a lot about
as being this new,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.476
exciting part of medicine.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.010
Can you tell me more
about that?

21:51.043 --> 21:55.848
Yeah, the gut microbiome is
a ecosystem that's within us.

21:55.882 --> 21:59.486
Trillions of bacteria,
but also viruses, fungi,

21:59.519 --> 22:01.654
all kinds of organisms--

22:01.688 --> 22:03.356
Inside of our bodies?
Correct.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.492
You really don't want
to force-flush them out.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.893
The bacteria within us

22:06.926 --> 22:08.661
is similar
to the Amazon rainforest.

22:08.695 --> 22:09.829
Wow.
So more is better

22:09.862 --> 22:11.664
in terms of different species,

22:11.698 --> 22:14.467
and they work together in--
in like a symphony.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.068
And so this is a good thing
that we've got like

22:16.102 --> 22:17.303
an "Avatar" jungle

22:17.336 --> 22:19.639
of strange creatures
in our guts?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.007
Absolutely.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.342
So we actually work
in symbiosis with them.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.312
We actually feed them,
hopefully, the right foods,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.515
and in return,
they help nourish us.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.850
If you really want
to help them biodiversify,

22:30.883 --> 22:33.252
buy foods that are called
"prebiotic foods."

22:33.285 --> 22:34.521
Hmm.
These are foods

22:34.554 --> 22:36.723
that actually get fermented
by the bacteria

22:36.756 --> 22:39.058
into nutrients
that help support us.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.527
And what other kinds of foods?
Prebiotic?
Right.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.395
So there's prebiotic foods,
and then there's...

22:42.429 --> 22:45.031
There's probiotic foods--
foods that actually contain

22:45.064 --> 22:47.600
these live bacteria
that support us...
Hmm.

22:47.634 --> 22:51.704
Like kefir, yogurt,
sauerkraut, miso soup.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.040
These are things that actually
have the live bacteria

22:54.073 --> 22:55.908
that can actually
help repopulate

22:55.942 --> 22:59.378
and support these--
this large and vast ecosystem

22:59.412 --> 23:01.080
that really determines
our health.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.049
So a lot of wellness
practitioners will make claims

23:03.082 --> 23:04.884
about, "Oh, your body's out
of balance,

23:04.917 --> 23:06.285
and you need to correct it."

23:06.318 --> 23:07.587
Is that a real thing?

23:07.620 --> 23:09.889
Is it possible for your body
to be out of balance?

23:09.922 --> 23:11.390
Yes, it is.
Oh, okay.

23:11.424 --> 23:12.692
Being out of balance,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.794
at least in the traditional
Chinese medicine,

23:14.827 --> 23:17.897
Ayurvedic medicine,
is what leads to disease.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.233
And some of that really is
believed to start in the gut.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.903
So if you want to get
someone's health back in order,

23:23.936 --> 23:26.238
the gut is a good place
to do that.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.140
So it's almost as though some
of those very ancient forms

23:28.174 --> 23:30.477
of medicine, traditional Chinese
medicine and things like that,

23:30.510 --> 23:32.044
we're actually finding
the reasons for why

23:32.078 --> 23:33.480
that might be
an accurate diagnosis

23:33.513 --> 23:34.614
that they would have given?

23:34.647 --> 23:36.415
Yeah, it's interesting
that the science

23:36.449 --> 23:39.385
now validates the practice,
whether it's ancient practice

23:39.418 --> 23:42.221
or a current practice,
by different practitioners

23:42.254 --> 23:44.256
who believe
in lifestyle medicine

23:44.290 --> 23:46.959
and holistic medicine--
is that we bring

23:46.993 --> 23:49.295
people's lifestyles back
in balance,

23:49.328 --> 23:50.763
which includes sleep,

23:50.797 --> 23:53.332
decrease stress,
and also the foods.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.101
Once you do all those things,
you can support

23:55.134 --> 23:57.837
the gut bacterial balance,
and they, in turn,

23:57.870 --> 24:00.473
will support our health
and mitigate disease.

24:00.507 --> 24:03.009
See, I love that,
because our argument on the show

24:03.042 --> 24:05.945
is not that all wellness
treatments or all forms

24:05.978 --> 24:07.780
of alternative medicine
are bad.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.415
Right.
It's that there's some,

24:09.448 --> 24:11.450
like colon cleanses
and the color-changing fabric

24:11.484 --> 24:13.920
that are real scams,
but then there are others

24:13.953 --> 24:15.822
that have a lot of validity
to them,

24:15.855 --> 24:18.124
and we can actually find out
which is which through science.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.292
Correct.
There's dietary studies,

24:20.326 --> 24:22.829
herbals, different
alternative medicine studies

24:22.862 --> 24:25.297
that are out there,
mind-body meditation,

24:25.331 --> 24:27.800
mindfulness--
there's many studies showing

24:27.834 --> 24:31.037
that there is evidence that
there is effectiveness for them.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.371
Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show

24:32.404 --> 24:33.372
to talk to us about this,
Dr. Mullin.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.974
Oh, my pleasure.
Thank you.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.175
And thank you, folks,
for watching.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.176
We'll see you next time.
