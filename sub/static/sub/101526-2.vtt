55:37.459 --> 55:39.962
<i>Nellie challenges Ah Toy,</i>

55:40.254 --> 55:41.421
calls out any element

55:41.505 --> 55:43.549
of hypocrisy she sees
about Ah Toy,

55:43.924 --> 55:48.136
and in doing so I think
it forces Ah Toy to look at

55:48.428 --> 55:51.306
the choices she's made
and maybe the justifications

55:51.807 --> 55:54.643
she's made for the world
that she's built around herself.

55:54.726 --> 55:57.437
AH TOY: My girls can go
anytime they want.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.231
I own no one.

56:00.732 --> 56:04.027
The Suey Sing
have apparently decided
to start selling opium now.

56:04.528 --> 56:07.281
We have an opportunity here
to send a message.

56:07.739 --> 56:08.907
A message?

56:10.867 --> 56:13.245
That the Long is able
to protect what's ours.

56:13.579 --> 56:15.497
Every bit as much
as the Hop Wei.

56:15.581 --> 56:18.208
The first few episodes
of season two,

56:18.417 --> 56:21.336
<i>you meet Mai Ling in a place</i>
<i>where her guard is up</i>

56:21.420 --> 56:23.922
and there is a mask that she has
to wear to protect herself.

56:24.006 --> 56:26.008
<i>You see her break</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

56:26.091 --> 56:27.634
<i>and she is vulnerable</i>
<i>with Li Yong.</i>

56:27.926 --> 56:30.929
We can tell that Li Yong
is trying to bring Mai Ling

56:31.013 --> 56:34.224
back on a path that he believes,
"This is the right way‐‐"

56:34.308 --> 56:36.184
Right way for her,
right way for Tong.

56:36.268 --> 56:37.102
Of course,

56:37.644 --> 56:40.480
Mai Ling has her own perspective
of where the Tong is gonna go.

56:41.273 --> 56:42.858
<i>And then, you know,</i>
<i>it reached the point</i>

56:42.941 --> 56:44.651
<i>that to do something</i>
<i>to save her,</i>

56:44.943 --> 56:46.028
to save Long Zi, like‐‐

56:46.111 --> 56:47.904
