THE PLEASURE CRUISE

18:28.977 --> 18:31.066

SO UNPLEASANTLY.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.896
I WAS TIRED
OF BEING A SHUT-IN,

18:34.939 --> 18:37.507
BUT I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
TO LEAVE,

18:37.551 --> 18:41.163
AND SO I DECIDED
TO LEAVE VICARIOUSLY

18:41.207 --> 18:44.035
AND PUSHED CHARLOTTE
OUT THE DOOR.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.647

FOR A BRASS POCKET WATCH,

A HEART OF GOLD.

I'VE CARRIED THIS WITH ME
SINCE THE FUNERAL

19:00.661 --> 19:05.970
AS A REMINDER TO STOP
LIVING VICARIOUSLY

19:06.014 --> 19:08.190
AND START LIVING LIVING.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.453
YOU'VE PROBABLY
SEEN HER FACE BEFORE.

19:10.497 --> 19:14.849
SHE WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS
AFTER SHE DIED.

OH, I HAVE DEFINITELY
SEEN HER FACE BEFORE.

Ned: DO YOU KNOW IF GUSTAV
EVER DONATED TO AN ORGANIZATION

19:31.909 --> 19:32.954
CALLED THE BELLMEN?

19:32.997 --> 19:34.216
Daniel: "THE BELLMEN"?

19:34.260 --> 19:35.826
EVERY HOUSE THAT'S BEEN
ROBBED WAS CALLED

19:35.870 --> 19:38.264
BY A BELLMEN TELEMARKETER
NAMED TAM PHONG.

19:38.307 --> 19:40.483
SO ELISE DIDN'T DO IT?

19:40.527 --> 19:43.791
THIS TAM PHONG
KILLED GUSTAV?

19:43.834 --> 19:45.662
[ Loudly ]
WELL, WHERE IS HE?!

19:45.706 --> 19:49.449
I'M GONNA FIND THAT MALFEAS-ASS
AND SLAM HIM DOWN --INSIDE VOICE.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.755
[ Whispering ]
I'm not talking about
the gavel of justice.OUTSIDE VOICE.

ABOUT SOUTHERN-STYLE,

19:58.545 --> 20:00.851
BEFORE YOU GET TO DOLING OUT

THE SMOKING GUN DON'T
ALWAYS POINT TO THE BAD GUY.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.161

SO TAM PHONG ISN'T
THE GUILTY PARTY?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.946
YES. NO. MAYBE.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.514
ALL WE KNOW IS, MAYBE HE HAD
A HAND IN MARKING THE MARK.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.473
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

20:13.516 --> 20:16.040
THAT GUSTAV COMPLETED
A SECOND WILL.Daniel: A SECOND WILL?

20:16.084 --> 20:19.522
HOPEFULLY, THAT
TARNISHED TROPHY WIFE
OF HIS IS EXCLUDED.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.220
WAIT, WAIT --
I'M HIS LAWYER.

20:21.263 --> 20:24.005
IF THERE WERE A SECOND WILL,
I WOULD HAVE DRAFTED IT,

20:24.048 --> 20:27.443
DRAWN IT UP, AND DRAWN
A TIDY 20% COMMISSION
FOR MY TROUBLES.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.271
SO HOW WOULD
YOU KNOW DIFFERENTLY?

20:29.315 --> 20:30.664
LET'S JUST SAY
THAT OUR PROCEDURES

20:30.707 --> 20:32.274
WOULD BE INADMISSIBLE
IN COURT.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.581
EITHER WAY, THE WILL WAS
TAKEN DURING THE ROBBERY.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.496
WELL, YOU PEOPLE REALLY
MIX THE GOOD WITH THE BAD.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.149
THE WORLD WOULD BE
A BETTER PLACE

20:38.193 --> 20:40.326
IF EVERYBODY DABBED CALAMINE
ON WELTS OF BAD NEWS.

20:40.369 --> 20:43.720
GUSTAV HOFER DESERVED BETTER
THAN THE WIFE HE HAD,

20:43.764 --> 20:48.203
AND THE WIFE HE HAD DIDN'T
DESERVE THE MONEY HE EARNED.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.598
YOU FIND THAT SECOND WILL,
I'LL DOUBLE YOUR FEE.

20:51.641 --> 20:55.384
OH, WE'LL FIND THAT WILL.WE'LL FIND THAT WILL.

THE HOUSES TO BE ROBBED

EVEN IF HE'S NOT
ROBBING THEM.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.650
WHAT IF WE PUT OUR NAMES
ON THE DO-CALL LIST?

21:00.694 --> 21:03.044
NO BURGLAR WORTH HIS BURGLES
WOULD TAKE THE BAIT

21:03.087 --> 21:05.307
IF THEY SAW
YOUR TINY-ASS APARTMENTS.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.309
WE COULD USE
MY AUNTS' HOUSE.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.573
OOH! IS THERE A STING!
I WANT TO STING.
CAN I STING?

21:10.617 --> 21:11.705
THAT'S A VERY BAD IDEA.

IN MY BEDROOM.

IF MY DAD DID KNOW DWIGHT,

AH, MRS. CARVILLE,
OF COURSE!

21:55.401 --> 21:57.054
PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT.

21:57.098 --> 22:00.101
I WON'T BE STAYING LONG,
JUST LONG ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN

22:00.144 --> 22:02.277
WHY I HATE

how a familiar smell

To be fair, I should tell you
that I have a gun in my pocket.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.513
To be fair,
I don't really believe you.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.428
To be even more fair,
all I have to do is scream,

26:44.472 --> 26:46.213
and a whole cadre
of big, strong men

26:46.256 --> 26:48.650
and sweet middle-aged ladies
with shotguns will come running.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.957
Fair enough.
And yet, you haven't.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.699
Perhaps because you believe that
society has a moral obligation

26:53.742 --> 26:56.179
to protect the least fortunate
of its ranks.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.660
And where society fails...You pick up the slack.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.228
Which sounds incredibly noble
until you kill someone.

if he could speak,

because he's dead.

First of all, Tam Phong is
but another unwitting victim
of my robberies.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.641
I swipe his phone list
to choose my targets.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.339
And Gustav?I robbed him, it's true.

27:25.382 --> 27:28.821
Not because he was stingy
and uncharitable,
but because he asked me to.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.387
He asked you to rob him?

27:30.431 --> 27:32.302
He was writing a new will
and needed to know

27:32.346 --> 27:34.261
whether to name his wife
as beneficiary.

27:34.304 --> 27:37.046
I know how this must sound,
but the facts were these --

27:37.090 --> 27:38.265

These were the facts --

OF A CRISIS OF FAITH.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.402

AND IF HE HAD ANY TRUE
FRIENDSHIPS AT ALL.

27:50.364 --> 27:52.801
AND THAT'S WHEN WE MET.

A CONTRIBUTION,
BUT I WOULDN'T LET HIM.

FOR THEIR SERVICES."

BUT I SAID,
"CHARITY IS AN IMPULSE,

28:00.853 --> 28:03.377
NOT A RETURN
FOR A FRIENDLY ACT."
SO WE TALKED.

28:03.420 --> 28:06.075
HE TOLD ME HIS PROBLEMS,
AND I OFFERED A SOLUTION.

28:06.119 --> 28:09.035
I AGREED TO ROB HIM.
HE WOULD APPEAR TO BE
AN INNOCENT VICTIM.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.906
IF HIS WIFE STAYED FAITHFULLY
BY HIS SIDE,

28:10.950 --> 28:12.734
HIS CONCERNS
COULD BE LAID TO REST.

28:12.778 --> 28:16.346
I'D RETURN HALF HIS FORTUNE AND
KEEP THE OTHER HALF FOR CHARITY.

28:16.390 --> 28:20.089
BUT GUSTAV'S WIFE INTERVENED,
AND I HAD TO GET OUT.

28:22.396 --> 28:25.442
I read in the paper the next day
what happened to Gustav.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.967
Even if you didn't kill him,
you're still a criminal.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.360
My duty is to
the downtrodden, the meek,

28:30.404 --> 28:33.320
those unable to reach
their own bootstraps,
let alone pull them.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.017
I take only what people
can afford to lose,

28:35.061 --> 28:37.759
and that certainly doesn't
include their lives.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.327
Do you like puppies?Yeah.

28:40.370 --> 28:43.112
The Papen County Animal
Shelter is about to be
shut down tomorrow

28:43.156 --> 28:45.680
unless I get them the money
to pay their mortgage.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.247
With nowhere to house
these animals,

28:47.290 --> 28:49.379
the dogcatchers are
calling it "The Big Sleep."

28:49.423 --> 28:50.946
You can save them?

28:50.990 --> 28:52.469
Only if the help
outweighs the hurt.

28:52.513 --> 28:54.994
The act of charity
always makes sense.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.299
Ned: YOU LET HIM GO?

28:56.343 --> 28:57.823
WHAT IF HE'S
A COLD-BLOODED MURDERER?

28:57.866 --> 29:00.303
SHUT IT. KITCHEN.IT WAS AN ACT OF CHARITY.

29:00.347 --> 29:03.916
THERE WERE PUPPIES INVOLVED.
AND BESIDES, MY GRUENEBERG
GANGLIA WASN'T ACTIVATED.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.569
THAT SOUNDS PERSONAL.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.223
SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THEM
FEMININE CONVERSATIONS

29:07.267 --> 29:08.834

WITH YOUR LADY FRIENDS.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.879

AT THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE

29:10.923 --> 29:12.315

AGGRESSIVE PHEROMONES.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.317
AS IN,
YOU CAN SNIFF OUT DANGER?

29:14.361 --> 29:16.711
AND THE ONLY THING I COULD SMELL
WAS A SWASHBUCKLING DO-GOODER

29:16.755 --> 29:18.408
WHO WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.280

PUPPY CRAP TO ME.

IT WAS A MISTAKE.

YOU'RE STRESS-BAKING ME.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.289
I'M CHANNELING FEAR
INTO ANGER.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.812
ANGER LEADS TO HATE.

29:30.856 --> 29:33.336
AND HATE LEADS TO STRESS-BAKING
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.860

THAN STRESS-RELEASING,

FOR THE BELLMAN.

ON HIS HEAD.

THE BELLMAN/PORTER
WAS HIDING SOMETHING.

29:43.825 --> 29:47.307

BUT HE MAY ALSO KNOW
WHO KILLED GUSTAV.

TO GO BACK IN THE GROUND.

TOUCHY SUBJECT FOR ME.

HOW DEEP, DARK,

30:25.432 --> 30:26.825

WHAT I COULD DO.

OF ICE CREAM AND BALLOONS,

30:31.525 --> 30:33.266
AND ENDS
IN A SMALL WHITE ROOM

ARE CUT OUT OF ME

LEFT TO CUT.THAT'S AWFUL.

WAKE UP MY DAD AND FIND OUT
WHAT DWIGHT WANTS.

THE LOAD IN OLIVE'S HEART

AS SHE ANXIOUSLY AWAITED
