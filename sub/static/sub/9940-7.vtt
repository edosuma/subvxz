- Monica...
- Who's Monica?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.709
- Mum...
- Mum?

00:25.800 --> 00:29.509
She looks absolutely beautiful.
I miss her.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.273
- Marry me.
- You know I've got a boyfriend.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.748
Two grand's worth of debt
and still rising!

00:35.840 --> 00:38.832
- 'Where is he? '
- 'We have got bailiffs front and back.'

00:38.920 --> 00:42.230
'Do you know your new name, Frank?
Dead Man Walking.'

00:42.320 --> 00:45.232
Mr Wilson, Housing Officer.

00:45.320 --> 00:49.711
You won't get away with that one
cos I'll haunt you for every last penny,

00:49.800 --> 00:51.631
- madam.
- (Screaming)

00:51.720 --> 00:55.508
He's no more help than you. We'd have
been better off without both of you.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.477
Over to you... Mum!

00:57.560 --> 00:59.391
Your house. Drive.

'Nobody's saying the Chatsworth Estate
is the Garden of Eden

'Fiona, who's a massive help.

why nobody calls him Phillip any more.

'Lan is like his mam,

01:33.240 --> 01:35.071

- Y'all right, Norm?
- No, summat just moved.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.793
- God, it is. It's a bloody rat!
- Don't be daft. It'll be the wind.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.836
(Squeaking)

03:02.920 --> 03:04.956
So what's this?

03:05.040 --> 03:07.270
A fart in a fur?

03:10.400 --> 03:13.153
(Debbie)
Mum, we're gonna be late for school!

03:13.240 --> 03:16.038
You cannot tread backwards, Monica.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.951
You don't belong here.

(Frank) 'The day I married Monica
was the happiest day of my life.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.353
'The day she left me
looking after six kids, I thought,

03:30.440 --> 03:33.989
"'Right, fuck her."
The day she reappears after three years

03:34.080 --> 03:37.868
'I just thought, "Absolutely.
Go on, Frank. Fuck her."'

03:37.960 --> 03:41.236
You spent the last three years
burying all this.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.072
There you go, love.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.277
Oh, I can't eat eggs.
I'm allergic. They're Carl's.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.430
Carl! Your tits are ready!

03:48.520 --> 03:52.274
- You never used to be allergic to eggs.
- I almost died from 'em.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.511
Your mum's trying to have
a conversation here.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.556
We can do our own breakfast.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.950
- If you want privacy, go back in the van.
- It stinks!

04:01.040 --> 04:03.838
- Never used to.
- I've just killed a rat that size.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.275
- Haven't I, Mon?
- Yeah.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.152
What size?

04:13.480 --> 04:15.630
What colour?

04:33.920 --> 04:36.912
Who in their right mind
keeps a rat as a pet?

04:43.120 --> 04:45.475
Pack up. We're going back to Moston.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.676
It's like Village Of The Damned.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.355
- Who else will look after 'em?
- Never bothered you before.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.795
Well, Fiona was here before.

04:58.280 --> 05:03.274
I'm not asking for a court report, only
if she sorted the school uniform out.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.954
Yes, cos lan nipped round with the milk.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.750
- So Monica hasn't abandoned the kids?
- It was all kosher when I popped round.

05:10.840 --> 05:15.516
Even Carl's? If he forgets his tie
one more time, they'll suspend him.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.036
- Oi! I'm trying to have a life here!
- 'Oh, fine.'

05:19.120 --> 05:21.873
I'll go round and check in three minutes.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.316
Make sure the kids have all got
my number and enough cash.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.675
Shall I do the washing-up as well?

05:27.760 --> 05:29.671
- I'm being serious.
- 'And me brief.'

05:29.760 --> 05:32.115
Ring us back in... half an hour or so.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.509
What are they like?

05:34.600 --> 05:37.512
Be quick.
I want to check Carl's got his tie.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.556
Aye, hang on. That's it.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.995

Yeah, you're right. It fits.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.232
A month ago,
you said you wouldn't be seen dead in it.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.630
Can't you take a joke?
I'm going for a paper. Owt you want?

06:24.720 --> 06:29.510
Yeah, get us enough for an overdose.
Tell the chemist I'll pay him later.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.353
Joke! Just practising.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.795
Hey, and a good 'un.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.552
See you later.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.234
I usually get a kiss.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.072
(lmaginary birds screeching)

07:07.880 --> 07:10.394
(Frank) Kev, see if
anyone's looking for us.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.675
- Watch. Watch.
- (Phone bleeping)

07:50.040 --> 07:51.996
Two bailiffs, six o'clock.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.629
- Is that front or back?
- Back, back. So be sharp.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.676
And watch out for Wilson.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.194
It's the shirt I'm feeling sorry for.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.237
It's not my fault
he's getting a stiffy for his ex.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.276
Best not be either.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.674
Hughesy! Hughesy, come here.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.275
Michael, over.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.429
Monica? Frank wants to see you.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.592
Don't dribble on that.
You're not keeping it.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.910
Not you! Where's Monica?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.834
Two reasons why Monica'll
never make it home - size doesn't matter

09:10.920 --> 09:13.434
and it's just a blister. It'll fade.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.956
Day we wed,
it was till death do us part.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.678
- If that's a threat...
- No.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.389
It's just a promise that she made me
on our wedding day.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.233
Are these dead, fellas?

09:25.320 --> 09:29.871
Here, chick. Fetch us a couple of bevvies
and whatever Worzel's having.

09:29.960 --> 09:34.431
Pint of Dog, cheese and onion pie
and some more nuts. She's paying.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.353
More nuts? In your dreams, daddio.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.192
That's a good 'un.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.511
- Is he allowed all this?
- Frank thinks I owe him big style

09:42.600 --> 09:45.160
- so he can have what he wants.
- And two Es.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.876
Two years ago

09:56.960 --> 10:00.316
we rescued a woman and her kids
from a total psycho.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.994
I'm not fucking interested.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.958
She'd have been dead now
if we hadn't killed her.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.236
Cos of him, she owed thousands.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.949
And she walked away
without so much as a paper bill.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.919
All we needed was one official agency
to list her as dead.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.197
Within a week,
it all went as quiet as a mouse for her.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.273
No debts, no bailiffs, no hassle...

10:25.360 --> 10:27.316
just like that.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.356
Imagine that, Frank.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.830
You pretend to be dead,
but your debts die for real.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.752
Actually, Sheila,

10:40.840 --> 10:44.549
we've had complaints about noise
from the neighbours.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.596
You having a bit of trouble?

10:47.680 --> 10:50.592
Frank's ex coming round
shouting the odds.

10:50.680 --> 10:55.834
They haven't seen each other for a bit
so they'd a lot to say, as it happens.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.353
You and Fiona,
you're as mad as each other.

11:04.440 --> 11:08.194
You'll spend your lives
cleaning up after Frank. Is he worth that?

11:08.280 --> 11:12.398
I'd give my right arm to spend my life
cleaning up after Frank.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.436
- Have you met Monica?
- No.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.559
Cracking on, she's a lesbian.
I saw the way she looked at him.

11:20.640 --> 11:25.236
- Fiona's mum's a lesbian?
- Not for long, she's not. You watch.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.789
Hey, hey... Here y'are.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.553
I can't see anybody fighting over Frank.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.995
I would if I could.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.311
She's got her feet back under the table
at Fiona's

11:43.400 --> 11:46.358
except it's not Fiona's
cos she's forced her out.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.557
- What? Fiona's gone?
- No choice. She's gone to live...

11:49.640 --> 11:51.392
- Where's she gone?
- Aaargh!

11:51.480 --> 11:53.755
- Aaaarghh, Michael!
- What?

11:53.840 --> 11:55.478
(Screaming)

11:55.560 --> 11:58.154
- What've you done to her?
- Tissue!

11:58.240 --> 12:00.310
- It's there in your hand.
- I know!

12:00.400 --> 12:02.152
I wiped me eyes!

12:02.240 --> 12:04.071
Chillies! Cooking with chillies!

12:04.160 --> 12:06.469
- I can't see!
- Bring her to the sink!

12:06.560 --> 12:09.791
- Let's have a look.
- Don't touch her if you held the towel!

12:09.880 --> 12:13.031
- I'm blind!
- Here you are, this way. This way.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.758
Rest on t'wall.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.910
Come into the kitchen. Sheila!

12:17.000 --> 12:19.230
(Sheila screaming)

12:19.320 --> 12:21.754
Here y'are, slam this over your fa...

12:26.440 --> 12:29.398
- (Shrieking hysterically)
- Over here, Sheila.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.918
Oh, my God!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.831
- Where am I?
- Home.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.593
- Chatsworth Estate.
- Where am I standing?

12:36.680 --> 12:37.999
Garden.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.638
(Birds singing)

13:23.320 --> 13:25.595
I did it.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.636
I went outside.

13:27.720 --> 13:31.599
- Where's Fiona gone?
- Five years.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.399
"She's gone to live round..."

13:35.400 --> 13:36.674
Steve's.

13:39.480 --> 13:43.996
- Oh, God. I think I'm going to faint.
- No, you're fine, Mrs Jackson.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.911
I know...

13:46.000 --> 13:47.877
(Thudding)

13:47.960 --> 13:50.076
Well, how does it work, then?

13:50.160 --> 13:52.435
Two teams of girls.
We've done it for years.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.034
A Team deals with deaths and overseas.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.476
B Team specialises
in "domestic" manoeuvres.

13:58.560 --> 14:03.793
Helping like-minded chicks do a runner.
Yeah, and money, accommodation etc.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.598
So which one are you?

14:05.680 --> 14:09.719
- You need military training for A.
- We're B.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.999
- So... you helped Monica leave me?
- No, that was Cindy, I think.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.038
- The two Juliets.
- Oh.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.112
So you knew you were a lezzer
before you fucked off?

14:21.200 --> 14:23.555
She's always been a chick, Frank,

14:23.640 --> 14:28.395
so don't build your hopes up. She can't
even look at a penis without gagging.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.755
So what would I have to do
if I went along with all this?

14:34.840 --> 14:36.876
The least, which is lucky.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.275
He thinks he stands a chance
and he won't listen to me.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.079
Well, don't apologise... Stan, yeah?

14:46.160 --> 14:50.790
Everyone's entitled to give it their
best shot. You can't hate him for it.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.991
Why's he sniffing round Chatsworth
for a love life if he can get it anywhere?

15:00.080 --> 15:04.835
Think about what you've just said and
apologise when you've worked it out.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.711
- I'm not saying that.
- You are fucking saying!

15:09.800 --> 15:12.553
- I'm not good enough for him?
- No, no, no.

15:12.640 --> 15:17.191
OK, maybe it came out wrong, but...
you think about what I said, Fiona.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.716
A middle-class bloke, money,
a fucking house this size...

15:20.800 --> 15:23.360
Come on. You don't meet
people like that.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.432
People like you
do not meet people like that.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.478
Oh, yeah, and Steve loves
Chatsworth so much

15:29.560 --> 15:32.438
- he asked you to move in here.
- No, it was my idea.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.080
He thinks coming here is a mistake.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.549
- For?
- Me, the kids.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.791
I have left them
with my mum and her girlfriend -

15:40.880 --> 15:43.519
neither of 'em capable
of running that house.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.878
And it's the kids that are suffering -
again. And I agree with him.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.509
It's Steve saying that.
It's him talking me around.

15:51.600 --> 15:56.469
He spends more time at ours than he
does here. He'd move in permanently!

15:57.320 --> 16:00.790
- What?!
- That's the whole fucking point!

16:05.280 --> 16:06.838
How's that normal?

16:06.920 --> 16:10.549
A 25-year-old bloke.
He buys stuff like this.

16:11.960 --> 16:16.670
Oh, no, he'd rather stay on an estate with
his girlfriend and five suffering kids -

16:16.760 --> 16:19.797
- none of 'em hers.
- Make it sound like a pigsty.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.555
That's what it would look like to him.
How could it not?

16:23.640 --> 16:25.676
- (Door opening)
- Think.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.478
(Steve) Sorry, Helmet, time's up.

16:27.560 --> 16:31.633
Fiona, the kids just rang.
They need us round at yours now.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.518
I'm going. Think about what I said, Fiona.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.276
Right, go, Stan!

16:54.360 --> 16:57.033
Didn't I say I can often surprise myself?

16:57.120 --> 16:59.395
I'm not in the fucking mood. Drive!

16:59.480 --> 17:02.711
I'm not in the fucking mood either,
so calm down.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.439
Wing mirror. Blue car. His? Yeah?

17:06.640 --> 17:09.313
So? He doesn't have to pay for it.
His work does.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.356
It's nicked.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.838
The VIN number
doesn't match the reg plate.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.515
- How do you know?
- He's got a pair of plates in the boot.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.717
Not the current one.
Not the original one either.

17:25.800 --> 17:30.874
Hey, again, Mr Premature Ejaculation.
Buckle up. We've got work to do.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.279
- We nick him.
- We will.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.918
But if we nick him for more,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.391
we're looking at a longer-term sentence,
not a holiday camp. Get me?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.316
What's going on?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.789
(Monica) Your dad's got news for you.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.670
(Frank) I'm dying, apparently.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.877
(Fiona) You what?

18:04.440 --> 18:07.159
(Phone ringing)

18:07.240 --> 18:09.196
Yeah, Steven with a V.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.196
McBride.

18:13.040 --> 18:19.593
62 Whalley Lane, Manchester M142KM.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.516
(Wilson) It's not good news.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.272
But don't blame me.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.920
Eviction notice.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.676
They want you out. They mean it.
They've had enough of your dad -

18:34.760 --> 18:37.513
not so much the deviance as the lies.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.949
Well, they'll love the next bit.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.916
You best come in, Mr Wilson.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.438
Oh, sweet Jesus, no!

18:57.520 --> 19:00.318
Both wrists and a bottle of tablets.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.356
- I blame meself.
- So do I.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.079
- We all do.
- I'm off to work.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.799
Work? Surely not?

19:07.880 --> 19:11.270
I fucking hated him.
And I need the money.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.513
Are you OK, Mr Wilson?

19:19.600 --> 19:23.115
It was never the best job in the world,
but never this bad

19:23.200 --> 19:24.997
by a long chalk.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.157
Do you mind if I...

19:32.240 --> 19:37.109
Please do. He'd appreciate it
if you paid your respects.

19:43.680 --> 19:48.196
Dear Lord,
help us house the tenants we could

19:48.280 --> 19:51.909
Show compassion and mercy
whenever we should

19:52.000 --> 19:53.877
Lord...

19:53.960 --> 19:57.714
Give us strength
when full strength is needed

19:57.800 --> 20:01.076
To nail the ones we know
who have cheated

20:02.160 --> 20:06.915
Dear Lord, let not this trickiest job

20:07.000 --> 20:08.672
Make us grand

20:08.760 --> 20:12.309
Or smug or proud

20:12.400 --> 20:13.833
Or snobs.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.870
Something written by wife
to help me get through the job.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.158
She died last summer so I know
what you're all going through.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.232
So she'll be with me dad?

20:27.320 --> 20:29.709
No, she'll be over the other side

20:29.800 --> 20:31.597
probably.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.513
(Funeral bells chiming)

20:36.680 --> 20:39.194
Dead? How?

20:39.280 --> 20:41.635
Woman over there says heart attack.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.676
Fucking hell...

20:43.760 --> 20:48.231
- Poor Frank.
- No, there's summat not right about this.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.276
- Dad!
- Get off!

20:50.360 --> 20:54.478
- Another verse and I'd have croaked.
- Get back in the coffin!

20:54.560 --> 20:59.554
It freaks me out. I'm having flashbacks
to me mam. She's taking the piss.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.712
- She's trying to show me up.
- You don't need help.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.075
If they catch you,
you're dead anyway. In!

21:05.160 --> 21:08.232
Your parents had a clue,
dropping the L from "normal".

21:08.320 --> 21:10.880
I never borrowed any money
I couldn't repay.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.951
- You're a sad bitch.
- Dad!

21:13.040 --> 21:16.350
- In your box!
- Look at all you. Where's the L word?

21:16.440 --> 21:20.991
Loyalty - not doing what you're told
by this twisted, rug-chomping

21:21.080 --> 21:23.230
- fucking chimp!
- It's the bailiffs!

21:23.320 --> 21:25.629
If it's a warrant, we're in trouble.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.473
Frank, get in the coffin.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.638
Get him in, quick.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.591
(Banging at door)

21:37.560 --> 21:39.994
(Banging gets louder)

21:41.200 --> 21:43.760
Show a bit of respect...

21:51.800 --> 21:53.518
You piece of shit!

21:53.600 --> 21:57.639
Too late to apologise for that, love.
We were only doing our jobs.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.109
And we feel bad enough to leave this.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.076
(Debbie) To keep?

22:03.160 --> 22:07.233
He was a good bloke, your dad. We
meet a lot like him. They mean no harm.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.834
They always think they can pay it back.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.876
Boo! You're not dead!

22:11.960 --> 22:14.030
Get up now, you fuck!

22:14.120 --> 22:16.031
Michael, cut it out.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.429
Two and a half grand, and counting!

22:18.520 --> 22:21.114
- Plus the car one of you nicked.
- Michael.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.953
Michael! This is really, really sick.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.190
Hey, hey. No, look...

22:37.200 --> 22:38.838
I mean, I thought he was...

22:38.920 --> 22:40.478
I thought you were...

22:45.520 --> 22:47.476
Oh, shit!

22:55.520 --> 22:58.512
(Debbie)
Sheila, come out and help me. Help!

22:58.600 --> 23:00.318
Debbie!

23:00.400 --> 23:03.119
She-Sheila!

23:04.200 --> 23:06.077
- Debbie!
- Sheila, help me.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.797
Come on, Sheila. Now!

23:13.560 --> 23:15.039
Get off, you bastards!

23:15.120 --> 23:17.680
(Screaming) Get away!

23:17.760 --> 23:19.671
Get away!

23:21.280 --> 23:24.670
Aaagh! Aaagh! Aaagh! Aaagh!

23:27.840 --> 23:29.796
Sheila, you did it!

23:29.880 --> 23:33.031
- Sheila, it worked. The plan worked!
- I did it!

23:33.120 --> 23:36.476
I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it!

23:43.080 --> 23:45.071
(Sobbing)

23:55.760 --> 23:57.830
(Carl) He's dead!

23:57.920 --> 24:00.195
And he's not coming back!

24:12.320 --> 24:15.630
I'd love to know what people
thought about me when I'm dead.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.915
You wouldn't if you were Frank.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.716
There's Wilson.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.392
Family only.

24:38.480 --> 24:41.870
Definitely not you! Not tonight.

24:41.960 --> 24:46.715
There's a gazebo and dartboard round
the back for punters without invitations.

24:46.800 --> 24:51.555
Frank Gallagher was a deeply valued and
respected member of this community.

24:51.640 --> 24:52.993
(Laughter)

24:53.080 --> 24:56.470
He was a good friend and neighbour
and he'll be sorely missed.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.109
He once told me in private
that if he ever died unexpectedly

25:02.200 --> 25:05.078
that the one thing
he'd like saying at his wake

25:05.160 --> 25:06.798
was this...

25:09.080 --> 25:11.958
(Cheering)

25:13.360 --> 25:15.920
I'm ali-i-ve! Heh-heh-heh!

25:16.000 --> 25:18.833
(# (I've Had) The Time Of My Life)

25:18.920 --> 25:24.233
Are you there, Martin? Who the fuck
would bury anyone in a white suit?

25:24.320 --> 25:26.276
Whose idea was that?

25:26.360 --> 25:28.555
Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be

25:28.640 --> 25:30.517
a party-y-y!

25:38.440 --> 25:41.079
When you're ready.

25:41.160 --> 25:44.550
- (lan) Is it OK if I shoot off in a sec?
- Who you meeting?

25:46.040 --> 25:50.750
No, you've shown your face. Well done.
Once I've slung this down, I'm off.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.956
I thought Liam had a baby-sitter.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.873
- Only till nine.
- I'll come with you.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.428
No, you stay.
You're not used to a lock-in.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.750
You'll love it.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.036
(Door opening and closing)

26:15.840 --> 26:18.195
So you came home to collect Liam?

26:18.280 --> 26:20.555
Liam's in bed.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.114
Liam sleeps with the lights blazing.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.276
All the upstairs lights are off.

26:35.160 --> 26:38.311
- Have I done something wrong?
- No, not...

26:41.280 --> 26:45.592
Five nights out of seven,
Liam ends up in my bed

26:46.600 --> 26:48.955
and that doesn't bother you.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.554
- Not if I'm honest.
- It wasn't the question.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.229
The night you met me

26:58.120 --> 27:00.839
why didn't you take me back
to your house?

27:00.920 --> 27:02.876
Because yours was nearer.

27:03.960 --> 27:07.350
- And because I don't like mine.
- Sometimes, Stevie...

27:07.440 --> 27:11.115
I can't tell whether
it's me you're interested in

27:11.200 --> 27:13.156
or my family.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.957
What's that supposed to mean?

27:17.040 --> 27:21.556
It's obvious we need all the help we can
get, so how can we be good for you?

I think I'm quite a decent bloke.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.193
Plus...

31:28.440 --> 31:30.112
some day soon

31:31.200 --> 31:34.192
I really want to have a family of my own.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.595
I do too.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.154
I hadn't banked on one this big,
but I do too.

31:42.240 --> 31:46.597
Ooh... I definitely wouldn't do that, Fiona.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.709
BMW. 3 Series.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.711
Registration Y586...

31:53.800 --> 31:55.597
BC Y.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.275
Or the Shogun from Leeds. No?

32:00.640 --> 32:04.713
- The black Merc from Didsbury?
- I'm saying nothing till I get a lawyer.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.588
Fine. Say nothing.
We know what nothing means.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.716
(Tony) He's a thief.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.872
He's just a ringer.
That's all we've got here.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.030
That's where the money comes from.

32:16.120 --> 32:20.511
Don't listen to a word of this.
It's all bollocks. I want a lawyer.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.160
It's not "What Merc?",
just "I want a lawyer".

32:23.240 --> 32:25.435
It's the surest sign you're right.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.273
How come you're on your own, Tony?

32:31.360 --> 32:33.555
- It's a favour.
- For?

32:33.640 --> 32:36.279
The last thing I want
is embarrassment for you.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.316
Are you nicking him or not?

32:38.400 --> 32:41.312
- I'll leave that up to you.
- Oh, go on!

32:42.440 --> 32:44.556
- No, I'm saying...
- What, Tony? What?

32:44.640 --> 32:48.315
You let him go and I'm lumbered with
paying back favours to you?

32:48.400 --> 32:53.110
Fuck off. I told you months back that
you weren't my type. What do you do?

32:53.200 --> 32:55.031
- Blackmail?
- No, it's not.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.395
Bloody is, mate.

32:58.960 --> 33:02.714
- You've told him no, but he's still here.
- Only because

33:02.800 --> 33:05.314
I love him.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.072
A bloody car thief?

33:12.160 --> 33:14.754
That's not all he is!

33:35.880 --> 33:37.074
Steven McBride,

33:37.160 --> 33:40.357
- I am arresting you on suspicion of theft.
- Oh, no, Tony!

33:40.440 --> 33:43.591
- You do not have to say anything...
- Please, Tony, stop!

33:43.680 --> 33:45.557
(Siren)

33:54.360 --> 33:57.318
(Brakes on hard)

33:57.400 --> 33:59.470
(Doors slamming)

34:03.160 --> 34:07.199
How come it's always people like you
always get their own way?

34:07.280 --> 34:10.511
- You blew that, mate, not me.
- I am not your mate!

34:11.560 --> 34:14.552
If I take you in,
she won't talk to me again, will she?

34:14.639 --> 34:16.596
No.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.875
What have you got I haven't?

34:19.960 --> 34:22.155
I just got there before you, Tony.

34:26.760 --> 34:30.230
I promised that I'd never let anybody
do that again.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.391
Look, can I smoke?

34:43.679 --> 34:45.476
Do you want to help me out here?

35:00.280 --> 35:02.350
Could get five years for this.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.196
Have you ever driven a 3.5 litre?

35:13.280 --> 35:15.669
- No.
- Give it a try.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.398
Take it for a spin.

35:20.640 --> 35:26.158
Yeah, right. How to keep Tony quiet?
Buy him off. You fuck right off!

35:26.240 --> 35:28.356
- I've got principles.
- Yeah, so have I.

35:28.440 --> 35:32.069
- Huh!
- I've never committed one violent crime.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.720
I've never hurt anyone. I-I...

35:34.800 --> 35:37.314
I've never burgled anyone.
I don't need to.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.872
It's...

35:43.960 --> 35:49.193
It's a compulsion.
I just like driving other people's cars.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.158
Especially when I know
they're fully comp.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.196
Just imagine it.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.714
You're nipping out for a pint of milk -

35:57.800 --> 36:02.874
something as... mundane, something
as ordinary and boring as that.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.114
You wouldn't believe how sexy that is.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.033
Is it just because... it's not your car?

36:11.120 --> 36:12.792
Precisely that.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.390
And I swear that one

36:16.480 --> 36:18.436
is completely untraceable.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.954
Where would I say I got it?

36:24.640 --> 36:26.790
You bought it from me, in good faith.

36:26.880 --> 36:30.509
You give me a cheque for £15,000,
I'll give you 15 grand back in cash.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.716
(Door slamming)

36:54.800 --> 36:58.713
Mum, can I have some egg, Mum?
Mum, Mum, how I don't like my egg.

36:58.800 --> 37:02.236
It's all circular, Mum. Mum, Mum, Mum!

37:02.320 --> 37:04.276
(Chorus of competing voices)

37:08.960 --> 37:12.509
- Mum, what about my chips?
- I need a letter for games.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.478
- Mum, there's no ketchup!
- Mum!

37:15.560 --> 37:17.915
(All shouting at once)

37:18.000 --> 37:19.718
Liam!

37:19.800 --> 37:23.554
- He's still at the nursery.
- (Debbie) And it closes at five.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.234
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Mum...

37:26.320 --> 37:29.949
- At least she came back.
- She didn't. She were forced.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.749
- She's only here cos she can't leave.
- Right, hands up.

37:33.840 --> 37:38.277
Who believes her when she says
she had no idea where we were living?

37:42.200 --> 37:44.316
Time for you to go... Mum.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.033
If a clairvoyant told me last week
I'd be doing this,

38:05.120 --> 38:07.793
I think I'd have hit her.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.200
- (Doorbell)
- I'll get that!

38:19.880 --> 38:23.873
- Fiona... how are you?
- Sheila, that was fantastic!

38:23.960 --> 38:25.916
And is the other bit true?

38:26.000 --> 38:29.879
Nurse came this morning
with the dates for the antenatal.

38:29.960 --> 38:33.555
- I did it!
- Oh, congratulations!

38:35.040 --> 38:36.871
Give us them flowers, you.

38:36.960 --> 38:40.430
I was gonna ask if you wanted anything
from the supermarket

38:40.520 --> 38:43.478
- but do you fancy coming?
- Oh, my God, Frank.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.516
- I can do me own shopping.
- Good.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.318
Hey, don't go mad though.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.152
Oh, give over. I'm loaded.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.073
I've spent next to nothing
the last five years.

38:52.160 --> 38:55.391
Ooh. Maternity clothes - I love 'em.

38:55.480 --> 38:59.075
Bereavement cards
from people who took it seriously.

39:00.280 --> 39:03.955
"Good luck, kids. One man's loss
can be a game for many."

39:04.040 --> 39:06.634
- Victor.
- I'll twat him when I see him.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.915
You won't have to
if he thinks you're dead.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.797
(Laughter)

39:10.880 --> 39:13.348
And a death benefit certificate for £25.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.829
- It'll go towards the funeral.
- (Sheila) How sweet.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.911
It's in my name.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.275
Ahhh. But I'll sign it over to you

39:20.360 --> 39:23.511
- as it's the last Giro you'll see.
- What you on about?

39:23.600 --> 39:26.114
Well, you can't claim if you're dead, Dad.

39:26.200 --> 39:30.398
(Sheila) Don't be gormless, Frank!
Even I worked that one out.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.476
- Devious fucking bitch!
- What?

39:36.560 --> 39:41.634
The fucking lezzers have done this
to get out of paying maintenance.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.950
But I claim enough for all three of us.

39:44.040 --> 39:48.113
Mum and Norma have settled for 100,
in cash, up front, every week to me.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.395
- Says who?
- Mum and Norma.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.789
Right.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.196
Frank!

40:06.080 --> 40:11.757
♪ I will find you there

40:11.840 --> 40:18.234
♪ You don't have to say you love me
just be close at hand

40:19.320 --> 40:26.032
♪ You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

40:26.120 --> 40:27.599
♪ Believe... ♪

40:27.680 --> 40:29.955
You stitched me up, you bitch.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.429
You whores of Satan.
Where's my money?

40:32.520 --> 40:36.957
Calm down, Frank. Everyone got what
they wanted. Nobody stitched anybody.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.190
I can't even claim basic. Basic!

40:39.280 --> 40:42.397
Well, your kids
never saw the money anyway.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.950
- They never saw any from her, did they?
- She was in recovery.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.395
Fuck off. You stitched me.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.436
Hey, hey. That's enough.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.476
No, don't patronise me.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.949
Frank's a pussy, aren't ya?

40:55.040 --> 40:57.315
Mee-oww, mee-oww.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.038
- Say a prayer!
- (Cheering)

41:00.280 --> 41:01.952
Wanker.

41:03.480 --> 41:04.879
Look out!

41:04.960 --> 41:07.918
Oh, Frank! You tosser.
What have you done?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.230
You dickhead.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.390
- Are you all right?
- Yeah?

41:12.480 --> 41:13.754
Well?

41:13.840 --> 41:16.274
And? OK?

41:16.360 --> 41:19.557
OK, come on. You fuck like a bloke.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.392
Come on, fight like one.

41:32.120 --> 41:36.238
You going for a beer? Three beers,
please. You're showing off.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.438
- Which one's yours?
- It's the one at the end

41:41.520 --> 41:43.351
next to the derelict house.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.795
- Hiya, Sheila.
- Hiya, Steve!

41:47.440 --> 41:49.158
Hiya, Kev. How are you?

41:51.160 --> 41:53.116
- State of me!
- Hiya, gorgeous.

41:53.200 --> 41:58.558
(Sheila) Credit card expired in 2000
so we had to get cash, didn't we?

41:58.640 --> 42:00.790
I loved it!

42:00.880 --> 42:05.112
Sheila, you look about three months
more pregnant than last time.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.156
- It's a cushion.
- Is it?

42:07.240 --> 42:10.676
I'm testing my smocks.
What do you think?

42:12.520 --> 42:16.069
- God, your shoes are top.
- We got lagers here.

42:16.160 --> 42:20.358
We're just having a break, Fiona,
from fixing Steve's boiler.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.431
Fucking slave-driver or what?

42:22.520 --> 42:25.717
Let it be
and give us an hand with the bags.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.756
Here y'are.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.513
Thanks. Come on.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.075
- And you can pack that in for a start.
- What?

42:55.160 --> 42:58.869
- Steve's boiler? He hasn't moved in yet.
- Yes, I have.

42:58.960 --> 43:02.919
I took the liberty of bringing
some clothes and a bit of furniture.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.877
- Ahhhh.
- No, you haven't.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.916
Oh, sorry...

43:07.000 --> 43:09.912
Sorry, you thought I meant your house.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.150
No, you see, I meant ours.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.276
- Is he for real?
- Yep.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.397
- He did a cash deal.
- For more than it's worth, if you ask me.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.755
It took a month of hard bargaining.

43:27.840 --> 43:31.879
You weren't meant to find out
and that was long before Helmet...

43:31.960 --> 43:34.793
Hey, speak of the bent little devil.

43:34.880 --> 43:38.031
- He-hey! Helmet!
- (Whooping)

43:43.120 --> 43:45.076
- Can I look?
- Oi. Hey.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.072
Look... I haven't finished.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.116
What I want to say...

43:51.200 --> 43:54.795
is, Fiona, from the bottom of my heart,

43:54.880 --> 43:56.996
I love you.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.036
Happy 21 st.

44:04.760 --> 44:06.716
(She splutters)

44:14.720 --> 44:17.598
(Cheering)

44:19.200 --> 44:20.872
Oi, all right!

44:24.640 --> 44:28.599
- I could fit this over your arm.
- Erm, best not, yet.

44:28.680 --> 44:31.956
- It'll be great in a fortnight.
- Kev reckons it only cost 500.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.996
- That's if you want it.
- You don't have to.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.959
- I can be in charge next door.
- Yeah, that'd be top.

44:38.040 --> 44:42.431
A couple of hands to do it up.
That'll come off the insurance claim.

44:42.520 --> 44:44.829
What insurance claim?

44:46.040 --> 44:47.951
Oh, fucking hell!

44:54.440 --> 44:57.557
(Whooping and cheering)

45:07.200 --> 45:10.829
- That'd be your boiler, then, Steve?
- Seems like it, Kev.

45:10.920 --> 45:14.549
Wouldn't you know it?
British workmanship. Whoo-hoo!

45:17.720 --> 45:19.392
Come here.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.708
(Screams)

45:26.240 --> 45:28.993
(Frank) 'That's why Tony Blair's a no-no.

45:29.880 --> 45:33.429
'Forget Iraq. Never mind pensions.

45:33.520 --> 45:38.196
'All that gimp's achieved is making
lesbians think they own the place

45:38.280 --> 45:43.673
'while working class heroes like me are
left propping the bleeding country up.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.432
'Well, fuck him!

45:48.640 --> 45:51.393
'Actually, don't, I bet he'd love it.'

46:34.320 --> 46:36.276
(TV is on)

46:42.960 --> 46:44.712
(Frank whistling)

46:46.760 --> 46:49.752
(Sheila) You'll have to wait,
you dirty boy.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.912
I promised to go and see my mam
before she died.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.956
- (Horn)
- There's me taxi.
