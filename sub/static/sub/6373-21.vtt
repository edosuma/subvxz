<i>[Amanda] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.569 --> 00:04.469
Bradford is into feet?

00:04.537 --> 00:07.165
Bradford Meade won't be able
to keep his hands off you.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.232
- You'll be running Meade Publications.
- That's the idea.

00:10.310 --> 00:14.041
What we have is wonderful,
but I'm never gonna divorce Claire.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.945
Need a condom? I got one in my wallet.

00:16.015 --> 00:19.179
Get her out the country, you'll have
everything you ever wanted.

00:19.252 --> 00:20.241
She's already hooked.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.118
You sleep with women
to distract yourself from your life.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.781
You use them like a drug.

00:24.858 --> 00:28.350
- I've missed you.
- I missed you too.

00:29.095 --> 00:30.926
They're sending me back to Mexico.

00:34.634 --> 00:39.003
Twelve hundred dollars for a ticket
to Guadalajara? That's ridiculous.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.666
Are they kidding? We cannot afford that.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.869
Hilda. I got it.

00:44.944 --> 00:47.742
No, I don't want a package deal
to Acapulco.

00:47.814 --> 00:52.547
My father is being sent back to Mexico
to wait for his visa and then he'll...

00:52.619 --> 00:54.416
Yes, I'll hold. [groans]

00:54.487 --> 00:56.819
[Valerie] Are you still working
on those nails?

00:56.890 --> 00:59.085
You do know the final exam
is timed, right?

00:59.159 --> 01:02.720
Look, Valerie, I'm going through
problems with my family right now...

01:02.796 --> 01:05.924
Oh, no, no.
I don't want your excuses, Suarez.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.194
I want your commitment to beauty.

01:08.268 --> 01:11.328
What does this look like?

01:11.404 --> 01:14.100
- My God. Is that an engagement ring?
- Yeah.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.335
- My ex and I started dating again.
- Lose it.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.378
You cannot do a professional
manicure with claws like those.

01:19.446 --> 01:22.279
Cut 'em before the exam tomorrow,
or I fail you.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.582
- She seems very helpful.
- [Scoffs] She's 130 pounds of bitch.

01:30.390 --> 01:33.325
- What did you say?
- 120.

01:34.961 --> 01:38.624
We'll take care of this ticket thing
tonight. I'll cancel with Santos.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.690
We can call every travel agency
in Jackson Heights.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.328
I have this thing I have to
go to after work. Whoops...

01:45.538 --> 01:46.800
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

01:46.873 --> 01:50.309
<i>It's the Mode party for
Administrative Professionals Day.</i>

01:51.311 --> 01:53.245
- You mean Secretaries Day?
- No.

01:53.313 --> 01:56.942
In 1998, they changed it
to "Administrative Professionals Day."

01:57.016 --> 02:00.577
That really rolls off the tongue.
So, where you guys gonna go?

02:00.653 --> 02:04.145
You know that theme restaurant
in Times Square, the Middle Ages?

02:04.224 --> 02:07.819
<i>Those snobby assistants from Mode
actually like that kind of place?</i>

02:07.894 --> 02:11.421
Love it. They pick a place where
they can make fun of the common people.

02:11.498 --> 02:14.228
Last year it was that roller disco
in the Bronx.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.497
- Wheels of Paradise? I love that place.
- I know. Anyway...

02:17.570 --> 02:20.004
I'm the one who planned it,
so I have to be there,

02:20.073 --> 02:23.406
- to make sure everything goes OK.
- Well, it is Secretaries Day.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.913
Maybe Daniel will give you a big bonus,
and we can use it to buy Papi's ticket.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.108
Happy Secretaries Day.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.617
Oh. Uh...

02:33.686 --> 02:37.622
"World's best... notary"?

02:37.690 --> 02:39.715
I, uh, got to the store a little late.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.818
Well, it's the thought
that counts, right?

02:42.896 --> 02:46.696
But they changed it to "Administrative
Professionals Day" in 1998.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.963
Right. Can you get me Olivier Theyskens?

02:50.036 --> 02:52.027
He promised us a Nina Ricci spread.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.630
And send over some hot girls for that.

02:54.707 --> 02:57.767
I'm in the mood for redheads.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.677
- This is work-related?
- We'll see.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.286
- What's that?
- Yogurt.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.585
- My yogurt?
- It didn't have a name on it.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.592
My name was on the granola on top of it.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.220
Don't you know
the refrigerator stacking system?

03:16.296 --> 03:19.459
So does that mean
that the cherry pie was yours, too?

03:19.532 --> 03:21.898
- You ate my pie?
- Well, not yet.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.064
Game on, Suarez. Game on.

03:28.808 --> 03:31.606
[Amanda] God, I hate Secretaries Day.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.470
You hide it so well.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.879
Everyone gets a present
but the receptionist.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.713
I might as well be invisible.

03:38.785 --> 03:41.185
I mean, who do they think
forwards the calls?

03:42.388 --> 03:44.379
Who fans the magazines?

03:44.991 --> 03:47.050
- Hey.
- Who signs for packages?

03:47.694 --> 03:50.128
- Tim, Sheila, and Betty.
- Ugh!

03:51.197 --> 03:54.189
Well, who looks hot for everyone
when they come in?

03:54.267 --> 03:56.861
These buttons don't just
pop open by themselves.

03:56.936 --> 03:59.564
- Where'd you get that vest?
- This? It's Tavares.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.800
That cutie designer
made you another one?

04:01.874 --> 04:04.843
What's with the gifties?
Not like you're sleeping with him.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.243
'Course not. He's gay,
I'm a woman, and he's gay.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.281
[Nick] Oh, yeah!

04:09.349 --> 04:11.943
Hey, what's Fratty so happy about?

04:12.018 --> 04:14.009
Did his sports team win the beef bowl?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.920
Close. Alexis signed him up
for a beer-of-the-month club

04:16.990 --> 04:19.515
for Secre... tariat's birthday.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.822
He loves horsies. Who knew?

04:22.895 --> 04:24.886
I am now officially miserable.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.558
Oh, wait till we get to that
Middle Ages place tonight

04:27.634 --> 04:29.693
and make fun
of the nerds in shining armor.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.363
It'll be the mocking event
of the season.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.271
- I think I'm gonna pass.
- What? You can't pass.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.774
I'm not going stag, hag.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.777
You'll have to buy
your own beer, queer.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.904
- You can't just ditch, bi...
- Shut up!

04:43.016 --> 04:46.281
- [Humming]
- [Jazz music plays]

04:49.122 --> 04:50.384
[Timer bell rings]

04:50.456 --> 04:52.617
OK, tried it. Still hate it.

04:52.692 --> 04:55.252
You are so white sometimes.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.489
I'm white and I'm bored.

04:57.563 --> 05:00.589
You know why you don't like jazz?

05:00.667 --> 05:04.933
Because it's about riffing
and being spontaneous.

05:06.339 --> 05:09.570
You would love jazz if you saw it live.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.110
I am gonna take you
to the Blue Note tonight.

05:12.178 --> 05:15.079
Willie, can we hold off on that?

05:15.148 --> 05:18.379
Why? All we do is stay in.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.942
It's just that with Claire in prison,

05:21.020 --> 05:23.284
it's the last thing
she needs to hear about.

05:23.356 --> 05:27.417
Don't you think it's time
you moved on with your life, our lives?

05:29.295 --> 05:32.560
- Really care what a murderer thinks?
- She is not a murderer.

05:32.632 --> 05:36.659
And I will not leave her
just because of one moment of insanity.

05:41.774 --> 05:44.140
- It would never work.
- Of course it would.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.838
So why wouldn't you
wanna go to Brazil with me?

05:46.913 --> 05:51.680
For one, I've got sideburns
and a moustache in my passport photo.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.112
Come on, Rodrigo,
I can't do this right now.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.056
My mother's in prison.
How can I just leave her?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.821
I would think your mother
would want you to be happy.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.902
So, should I get used to
this whole mug-shot look?

06:11.971 --> 06:16.408
I was out late at the... therapy meeting
you signed me up for.

06:16.476 --> 06:20.071
- Who's Kristin?
- Uh, met her at the meeting.

06:20.146 --> 06:23.741
"Soho Grand, Room 709. I'm going to..."

06:25.284 --> 06:28.947
- Not gonna finish reading that.
- OK, so maybe I didn't go to a meeting.

06:29.021 --> 06:31.012
Daniel, what are you doing?

06:31.090 --> 06:33.923
You have a problem.
You slept with an underaged model.

06:33.993 --> 06:38.953
Yeah, who turned out not to be underage.
Why are you so "glass half empty"?

06:39.031 --> 06:43.092
No, the glass is crushed into a million
little pieces all over the floor.

06:43.169 --> 06:46.730
I'm just waiting for you to step on it.
You got lucky.

06:46.806 --> 06:49.331
Next time, you won't.

06:52.111 --> 06:55.512
Do you think people will want
the Royal Feast or the Jester's Banquet?

06:55.581 --> 07:00.075
People just wanna get drunk. Look. This
is a way you could make some money.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.747
NYU is looking for
some research subjects.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.188
- How much?
- Five thousand dollars.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.819
Right, all you have to do
is get injected with...

07:08.895 --> 07:12.831
Can't quite read that.
Several syllables. And side effects.

07:12.899 --> 07:16.027
Let's keep that as a backup.
Aren't there any part-time jobs?

07:16.102 --> 07:18.730
- Got any welding experience?
- Oh, my God, yes.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.239
- You weld?
- No, Christina, look.

07:21.307 --> 07:25.141
I could get $1,000 for riding some
mechanical horse for just 15 seconds?

07:25.211 --> 07:26.542
I could totally do that.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.410
Sure you wouldn't rather
just deal with the side effects?

07:29.482 --> 07:32.280
When I was a little girl,
I hated getting my allergy shots,

07:32.351 --> 07:34.785
so I used to grab onto this tree
outside my house

07:34.854 --> 07:37.880
and wrap my legs around so tight,
no one could pull me off.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.891
These are thighs of steel.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.793
Betty, I think there is a big difference
between a giant robot horse and a tree.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.423
I'm telling you, I could do this.

07:46.499 --> 07:47.796
[Classical music plays]

07:47.867 --> 07:49.562
Yay!

07:49.635 --> 07:51.500
[Crowd cheering]

07:51.571 --> 07:53.766
If this is what it takes
to help my father,

07:53.840 --> 07:57.970
then I will ride that giant robot horse
all the way to Mexico.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.999
OK, seriously, ye olde bowl cut.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.470
- It's too easy.
- Exactly.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.769
Imagine 30 guys dressed like me,

08:28.841 --> 08:32.538
serving tourists
with mullets and fanny packs.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.705
Middle Ages is gonna be duh-licious.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.510
It's gonna be Britney
shaving her head all over again.

08:37.582 --> 08:41.144
- That was fun. But then it got sad.
- No, but then it got fun again.

08:41.220 --> 08:44.121
What's your deal, anyway?
Why won't you come?

08:44.190 --> 08:48.456
OK, promise you won't
say anything to anyone?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.962
I swear on the abs of Mark Wahlberg.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.122
Wow, you are serious.

08:52.198 --> 08:56.726
OK, remember how,
before I worked here, I was an actress?

08:56.802 --> 08:58.394
Mm-hmm.

08:59.906 --> 09:04.707
[Gasps] Shut the front door.
Your acting reel?

09:04.777 --> 09:06.176
Bring it.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.146
[Amanda] Hi, Grandma.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.705
- Hey, Betty.
- Henry.

09:10.783 --> 09:14.583
Hey. I heard you were planning the
Administrative Professionals Day party.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.316
- I was wondering if I can crash.
- Really?

09:17.390 --> 09:21.850
Yeah. Bit of a Dungeons & Dragons geek.
Big surprise, I know.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.328
I guess I have sort of a soft spot

09:24.397 --> 09:27.958
for castles and chivalry
and... princesses.

09:31.537 --> 09:35.667
OK, well, I'll just put you and Charlie
on the scroll at the door.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.106
Charlie can't make it.

09:37.176 --> 09:40.441
She's been waiting for blanket space
to open up to sell her jewelry.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.311
Anyway, yesterday one of the guys
got some bad chicken.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.543
Long story short,
now she has a prime spot.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.552
Well, that's great for Charlie,

09:47.620 --> 09:51.886
and for salmonella, I guess.

09:51.958 --> 09:55.951
OK, well, I shall see thee
in the Middle Ages, milady.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.329
- You're such a dork.
- You know you love it.

wait for it... larious.

For you, maybe. They play this thing
on a loop by the front door.

All these losers are gonna see it, and
they will never let me live this down.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.692
The losers'll be too busy
ordering jalapeno poppers

11:08.768 --> 11:10.599
to watch some stupid welcome video.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.694
I'm not going.

11:11.771 --> 11:15.605
Come on, Mandy-pants. If you don't go,
they'll laugh at you behind your back.

11:15.675 --> 11:20.112
And, besides, if you're there,
you'll know who to punish tomorrow.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.574
Well, I do like punishing people.

11:25.718 --> 11:29.484
- [Betty] Your three o'clock is here.
- I don't have a three o'clock.

You do now. Daniel Meade, Tyler Blake.

Psychology Now on the 14th floor.</i>

He's here to help you with...
[whispers] your sex problems.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.001
What is the matter with you?

11:45.071 --> 11:48.802
You went to the 14th floor, grabbed the
first guy you saw, told him I'm a freak?

11:48.874 --> 11:52.139
He's the third guy I saw. The first two
thought you were a lost cause.

11:52.211 --> 11:56.477
Come on, Daniel. He specializes
in sexual compulsion issues.

11:58.017 --> 12:02.886
OK, well, I'm sure that
that has some therapeutic value.

12:05.624 --> 12:08.991
I am not spilling my guts out
to some hack magazine writer.

Betty Suarez. Oh, hi.
Thank you so much for calling me back.

12:21.440 --> 12:25.240
What? No, eleven hundred dollars
is still too expensive.

12:25.311 --> 12:28.007
- Hold on. Where are you going?
- Model casting session.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.674
- I am not doing this.
- You're not going anywhere.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.115
I've made this easy for you.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.812
No, he has to be in Mexico by Friday.
I already told you.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.354
- Who?
- My father.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.913
He's gonna be deported
if we can't get him to Mexico.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.959
We don't have the money for his ticket.

12:41.026 --> 12:44.086
And you have everything,
and you won't even help yourself.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.927
Forget about it.
Go with your models. I give up.

12:46.999 --> 12:50.833
OK, jeez. Now you've ruined
the whole model thing for me.

12:50.903 --> 12:54.304
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I didn't wanna bother you.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.897
You have problems of your own.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.637
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- You wanna help me?

12:58.711 --> 13:02.169
Then go in there and talk to Tyler
and try and get better.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.258
No! Don't do it.

13:13.325 --> 13:16.385
Barbra didn't cut her nails
to play Yentl. Why should you?

13:16.462 --> 13:19.727
I have no choice.
If I don't cut them, Valerie fails me.

- Yoga.
- [Prison guard] Hey, no touching.

14:09.882 --> 14:13.318
At least here you can score
a decent glass of toilet wine.

Aside from the fact
that my mother's drinking toilet wine?

14:20.559 --> 14:24.359
It's Rodrigo.
I think I'm falling for him.

- And what do you want?
- I don't know.

Honey, as hard as it's been
with your father and me over the years,

14:34.907 --> 14:37.000
we've always stood by each other.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.170

with somebody,

15:22.922 --> 15:25.186
It looked OK
when you wore it to visit Martha.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.522
I was trying to detract from that
God-awful sweater she knitted me.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.995
Why are you going to visit that gangly
old boozehound Claire anyway?

15:32.064 --> 15:36.364
Because Bradford refuses to divorce her,
and I refuse to accept it.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.834
So I'm thinking

15:37.903 --> 15:42.704
maybe I can convince Claire
to divorce him.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.943
Will you be back in time for

go out on a sexless date?

- Skipping work, ignoring my friends.

25:22.087 --> 25:24.078
You wanna know how I got through?

- What is this?
- Something I found overseas.

No, no, you don't understand.
It's not what it looks like.

I'm not stupid, Betty, OK?
I've seen the way he looks at you.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.886
