WEBVTT

00:13.888 --> 00:14.931
Meow.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.933
[Douxie whistling]

00:17.434 --> 00:18.685
[theme music playing]

00:46.921 --> 00:50.216
-[horse neighs]
-[knight] What manner of sorcery is this?

00:54.721 --> 00:56.139
Wow!

00:56.222 --> 00:58.850
-Sir Lancelot, um--
-He's so handsome.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.268
-I-- We--
-[Lancelot] Wait!

01:00.351 --> 01:02.854
Aren't you Merlin's errand boy?

01:02.937 --> 01:05.356
-Apprentice.
-He's like a angel-man.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.692
-Whoa! [whimpering]
-[cracking]

01:07.776 --> 01:09.027
-[knights gasp]
-[horse neighs]

01:09.235 --> 01:10.070
[clears throat]

01:10.737 --> 01:12.822
-The devil--?
-[all gasp]

01:13.073 --> 01:15.075
[groans] What? How did I--

01:15.158 --> 01:16.993
-Jim! Are you okay?
-[Lancelot] Troll!

01:17.077 --> 01:19.037
Troll! To arms!

01:19.245 --> 01:21.122
-[knights grunt]
-Wait! Chill out, lads!

01:21.206 --> 01:22.332
Chill? Out?

01:22.415 --> 01:25.085
Take a breath, all right?
He's one of the good ones.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.294
There are no good ones.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.589
-[grunts]
-Monsters are forbidden in Arthur's lands.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.842
You'll hang before the king
for your insolence.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.720
Whoa, he even talks like an angel.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.806
Wait, what's an "insolence"? [grunts]

01:37.889 --> 01:39.182
[horse neighs]

01:41.518 --> 01:43.228
[Steve shouts] Let go of me!

01:43.645 --> 01:46.064
I want my one phone call! [grunts]

01:47.899 --> 01:49.818
This place was cooler flying.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.070
[indistinct chatter]

01:52.278 --> 01:54.155
Claire? What happened?

01:54.239 --> 01:56.074
What are we doing at a Renn faire?

01:56.157 --> 01:56.991
-[sizzles]
-Aah!

01:57.075 --> 01:59.702
-Jim!
-We're prisoners in the, uh, Dark Ages.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.497
-Mid 12th century with no way home.
-[Steve yelps]

02:02.580 --> 02:04.958
It's not an ideal situation.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.586
Ideal? Jim has a shard of evil magic
in his chest!

02:08.670 --> 02:13.383
Actually, I'm still hurt,
but it feels different somehow.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.260
Modrax's miracles, he's right!

02:15.426 --> 02:19.389
When we jumped back in time, it must have
frozen the corruption in place.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.724
Uh, seems I missed a lot.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.060
-Don't you work at the cafe?
-Part time.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.437
And thanks for always tipping, by the way.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.689
He's Merlin's apprentice.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.566
-It's a long story.
-[Lancelot] Open the gate!

02:29.732 --> 02:32.819
We have foreigners awaiting judgment
for King Arthur.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.154
Nah, no worries.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.613
Camelot's my old turf.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.533
-Just follow my lead.
-[guards shouting]

02:38.616 --> 02:41.995
-[Douxie] Be inconspicuous.
-[guard] Aye for prisoners! Coming!

02:43.997 --> 02:46.541
-[grunts]
-Gunmar's threatening our borders.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.126
Double our patrols.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.545
Here are the trespassers, my lord.

02:50.628 --> 02:51.713
[Arthur] A Troll?

02:51.796 --> 02:53.298
I thought I made it clear,

02:53.381 --> 02:57.010
your kind are unwelcome
when I banished you all from the realm.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.471
-Don't you mean "betrayed"?
-[huffs] Morgana!

03:00.555 --> 03:02.640
Inconspicuous, remember? [clears throat]

03:02.724 --> 03:06.102
You gave the woods
to enchanted creatures like these.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.312
You'd break that vow?

03:07.395 --> 03:12.400
These beasts care not,
especially not this spy of Gunmar's!

03:12.483 --> 03:14.110
Stop calling me a beast!

03:14.235 --> 03:16.237
[groans] Wait. Gunmar?

03:16.321 --> 03:19.407
[voice squeaks] Your Highness, ahem,
it's good to see you again.

03:19.490 --> 03:22.660
-And you are?
-Hisirdoux, Merlin's apprentice.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.913
I assure you he is no threat.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.707
That's my judgment to make, boy.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.126
-Trolls are born of magic...
-[people gasp]

03:32.378 --> 03:33.671
...as you are of blood.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.673
How is their nature a crime?

03:35.757 --> 03:39.344
When they ravage our lands,
take our loved ones from us.

03:39.427 --> 03:43.306
I made these laws
to hold this fragile land together,

03:43.389 --> 03:45.225
and they will be abided!

03:45.308 --> 03:47.936
Leave the wood, the penalty is death.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.021
What? No! Wait, wait!

03:50.104 --> 03:51.689
-I'm not a Troll!
-Whoa, hold-- hold on!

03:51.773 --> 03:53.149
Isn't this a bit hasty?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.484
Bring him to the sunlight.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.903
[Jim grunting]

03:57.111 --> 03:58.154
Jim! No!

03:58.529 --> 04:00.323
[grunting]

04:01.199 --> 04:04.994
-[sizzling]
-[screaming]

04:05.078 --> 04:05.912
Stop!

04:07.622 --> 04:09.624
[Morgana gasps] Shadow magic.

04:09.999 --> 04:10.833
[Arthur] Morgana...

04:12.126 --> 04:13.503
is this your witchery?

04:13.586 --> 04:14.504
Cease it at once!

04:14.587 --> 04:18.007
Just because you're scared of him
doesn't mean he shouldn't exist!

04:18.091 --> 04:19.592
It doesn't make him evil.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.803
But it makes him dangerous.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.764
I will not fail to protect my kingdom!

04:24.847 --> 04:27.642
If you give in to fear, that is failing.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.853
The girl speaks truth.
Please listen to her.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.981
Hmm... [sighs]

04:33.231 --> 04:36.526
Fine. I will show the Troll mercy.

04:36.734 --> 04:37.819
He will live...

04:38.319 --> 04:39.237
in the dungeon.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.905
-[grunting]
-Jim--

04:40.989 --> 04:41.990
He's alive.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.242
We'll get him out eventually.
Just trust me.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.328
As for you, Hisirdoux,
shouldn't you be with Merlin?

04:47.412 --> 04:51.582
Uh, yes. Well, I was busy
recruiting these two.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.668
They're here to help in the-- in the war!

04:53.751 --> 04:56.921
This is Claire of the House of NuÃ±ez.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.340
And... well, this is the village idiot.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.427
Oh, me? I'm just an "in-so-lent" knight.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.513
All-state champ! Sir Steve of Palchukia!

05:05.680 --> 05:09.767
Hmm, if you truly be friends of Camelot,
then prove your worth.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.602
-Hisirdoux, rejoin Merlin.
-[grunting]

05:11.686 --> 05:14.605
[Arthur] Sir Steve,
to Lancelot in the barracks.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.692
-As for you, Mistress Claire--
-I'll take the girl.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.277
I could use a new handmaiden.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.320
[Arthur] It is done.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.072
Now, out! I have a kingdom to protect.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.199
-[Galahad] Get in there, creature!
-[Jim grunts]

05:25.283 --> 05:27.118
-[door clangs shut]
-[Galahad laughs]

05:27.201 --> 05:29.495
You belong in the darkness!

05:30.121 --> 05:32.415
-[Galahad laughs]
-At least it's not the Darklands.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.584
So, what are you in for, skinny?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.919
-What?
-Ugh! Your crime?

05:37.128 --> 05:40.131
Being a Troll
where I'm not supposed to, I guess.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.049
Same.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.842
Arthur has a sick sense of humor.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.845
Steals my homelands,
then says I'm trespassing there.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.181
Now Trolls are forbidden

05:48.264 --> 05:50.516
along with anything else
that's not a fleshbag.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.560
Actually, I'm half fleshbag.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.895
[Troll laughs]

05:53.978 --> 05:55.563
Yeah, and I'm half goblin.

05:55.646 --> 05:56.773
Waka-chaka!

05:56.856 --> 05:58.566
Hey, that better be mud.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.860
-[laughing]
-[blows raspberry]

06:01.110 --> 06:03.946
He's at war with more than
just the Gumm-Gumms.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.866
[Troll] Ask Arthur,
the only good Troll's a dead one.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.659
Same goes for goblins, gnomes,

06:08.743 --> 06:12.955
and any other so-called "monster"
he doesn't understand.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.084
-The name's Callista.
-I'm Jim.

06:16.167 --> 06:20.004
-Welcome to the rest of your life.
-[sighs]

06:20.296 --> 06:22.590
-Well, that went better than expected.
-Are you kidding?

06:22.673 --> 06:26.260
Jim's in prison and I'm the servant
to a sorceress who tried to kill me.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.346
Even worse, I can't get a signal!

06:28.429 --> 06:30.765
Technically speaking,
she hasn't done that yet.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.267
I don't care!
We're not supposed to be here.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.146
We should be home, together,
helping our friends in the present.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.440
Their present. The future!

06:39.524 --> 06:41.150
Whatever! [crying]

06:42.193 --> 06:44.195
We can't return home... yet.

06:44.862 --> 06:48.282
Look, Merlin always insisted
we never mess with time.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.701
We'll have to find a way back
without screwing up history,

06:50.785 --> 06:52.745
or there won't be a future to go home to.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.871
Aw, man!

06:53.955 --> 06:59.418
Just like in that movie <i>Future Warrior 3,</i>
when the robots killed Alfred Einstein.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.170
-Yeah, exactly.
-[grunting]

07:01.254 --> 07:04.298
So, how do we get home?
You're the wizard expert here.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.093
The Time Map! It's here with Merlin!

07:07.260 --> 07:10.429
It could show us the way back
to the present without damaging the past.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.767
Then what are we waiting for, Dumbledork?
Let's go get the Time Thingy!

07:14.851 --> 07:15.685
What about Jim?

07:15.768 --> 07:18.438
Lake's probably safer down there
than we are up here.

07:18.521 --> 07:22.692
It's settled. We'll play our roles and
stay out of trouble while I get that map.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.694
[bottle shatters]

07:24.944 --> 07:27.822
[Merlin] Hisirdoux,
do you have feet for hands?

07:27.905 --> 07:29.824
All the Slorr juice?

07:29.907 --> 07:32.243
You know how long it takes
to milk one of those?

07:32.326 --> 07:35.246
Sorry, sir.
I was just trying to save time.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.457
[Douxie] Ugh, that hair was a mistake.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.375
[groans] I remember this.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.877
"Your cutting corners..."

07:40.960 --> 07:42.753
...has only cost me time.

07:42.837 --> 07:46.674
It's hard enough creating Arthur's
new weapon without your mucking about.

07:46.757 --> 07:51.053
I need you in the workshop,
and you're milking the Slorr.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.472
[whooshes]

07:53.014 --> 07:55.516
Well, here's hoping this doesn't break
the time-space continuum.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.935
-[muffled yelp]
-[gasps] Hey!

07:58.269 --> 08:00.062
-Aah!
-Um, hey, me.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.147
Aah! DoppelgÃ¤nger!

08:01.230 --> 08:03.149
You-- you're me. I'm me!

08:03.232 --> 08:05.109
-No need to panic.
-Well, how-- how...

08:05.193 --> 08:06.819
Wait, this can only mean one thing.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.070
[both] Time travel paradox.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.281
Double Douxies? This is a disaster!

08:10.364 --> 08:11.532
[both] Give me a break, Arch!

08:11.616 --> 08:13.618
[both] Oh, wow. This is wild!

08:13.701 --> 08:15.870
Let's focus on the here and now.

08:15.953 --> 08:19.040
-Where having two of us will be--
-Will be a logistical nightmare.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.834
I agree, uh, so the easiest solution--

08:21.918 --> 08:25.963
Is for one of us to go away
till I return to my time.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.507
Great idea!

08:27.590 --> 08:29.800
-But which one of us--
<i>-Interminus nocti sluumberso!</i>

08:29.884 --> 08:31.552
[snoring]

08:35.139 --> 08:38.684
I know this looks bad, but I swear
I've got this under control.

08:38.768 --> 08:42.063
If that were true, things in the future
have really changed.

08:42.146 --> 08:42.980
Ha ha.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.233
Just don't go blabbing to Merlin, okay?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.901
I need to stay incognito.

08:46.984 --> 08:47.818
-Aah!
-[snoring]

08:47.902 --> 08:49.904
Fine. This should be fun to watch.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.117
Hisirdoux, what is taking so long?

08:55.576 --> 08:57.954
-Just cleaning up another mess.
-[Archie meows]

09:00.081 --> 09:01.916
Swore I'd never do this again.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.627
[Morgana] We spell-casters
should be fleeing to the Wild Wood,

09:04.710 --> 09:06.712
not slaving away for that fool--

09:06.796 --> 09:08.422
Mind your tongue, Morgana.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.509
-You speak treason against our king!
-I speak truth.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.012
After all Arthur's done,
why build this amulet for him?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.557
It's not for him. It's for all of us.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.435
Gunmar's war is a threat
and the amulet will end it.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.353
The Time Map!

09:22.436 --> 09:27.650
Dragonstooth iron must be strong enough
to contain the Daylight Stone's power.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.654
<i>Aloochan gloria meia!</i>

09:33.197 --> 09:34.448
[shrieks]

09:34.699 --> 09:36.951
[laughing]

09:37.034 --> 09:38.035
Blast it all!

09:38.119 --> 09:43.082
Hisirdoux, stop gawking about and give me
a hand with those raw ores over there!

09:43.165 --> 09:45.418
[groans] Apologies, Master.

09:45.501 --> 09:49.422
How many more failures before you realize
this amulet of yours is pointless?

09:49.505 --> 09:54.885
I hear your concerns, but trust me,
the amulet will bring peace.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.971
At the cost of all we hold dear!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.891
How long before he comes for us?

10:00.975 --> 10:02.268
You're a fool, Merlin.

10:02.476 --> 10:03.769
And an old one at that.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.191
Oh, forget her. We've got this, right?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.485
What is this strangeness?

10:11.569 --> 10:12.778
Put your hand down.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.240
It's a high-five. It's a sign of victory
amongst barbarian tribes.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.825
It's-- It's a new thing.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.202
Human customs are terribly odd.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.204
Indeed.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.249
You don't seem yourself today, Hisirdoux.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.210
Well, except for your inability
to tidy up.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.092
No more distractions. Go milk the Slorr.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.636
-But I--
-Dismissed!

10:36.719 --> 10:38.512
I'm very impressed

10:38.596 --> 10:41.891
at how remarkably bad you are
at impersonating yourself.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.894
-[Steve] Hello? S-Sir Lancelot?
-[birds chirping]

10:45.436 --> 10:47.688
Lance? Buddy?

10:47.772 --> 10:48.773
-[galloping]
-[screams]

10:48.856 --> 10:49.857
Oy!

10:49.940 --> 10:51.859
[yelping, whimpers]

10:51.942 --> 10:54.820
Prepare yourself, lad. Ha ha ha!

10:54.904 --> 10:57.198
-[screams]
-Let us spar.

10:57.281 --> 10:58.282
Krav Maga!

10:58.532 --> 11:00.034
Come at me, scrub lord!

11:00.117 --> 11:02.328
[laughs] A worthy insult.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.539
Let's see if your combat
is as good as your boasting.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.875
[whimpering]

11:07.958 --> 11:09.585
[Steve screams, grunts]

11:09.835 --> 11:10.670
Huzzah!

11:11.712 --> 11:13.130
[straining]

11:13.214 --> 11:14.590
[laughs] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:14.674 --> 11:16.759
Uh? [screaming]

11:16.926 --> 11:17.760
Die!

11:18.844 --> 11:19.678
Yah!

11:19.762 --> 11:22.139
When one fights,
all secrets are laid bare.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.391
And I know yours.

11:23.474 --> 11:26.852
You are no knight; you are a pretender.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.479
What? [stammering]

11:28.562 --> 11:31.607
You're not the first squire
who faked noble lineage to seek glory.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.609
[chuckles] Your secret's safe with me.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.320
You've much to learn,
and I will train you.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.448
Really? [shouting] Ow!

11:39.698 --> 11:41.617
-[groans]
-You are an odd squire,

11:41.700 --> 11:45.162
but you have a trustworthy face,
Sir Steve of Palchukia.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.623
Wow! Thanks, Sir Boss-man.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.876
You're like the really big brother
I never wanted.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.337
-[clanging]
-Really, really big.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.422
[laughs]

11:54.505 --> 11:55.756
Oof!

11:59.760 --> 12:01.887
[Slorr chitters]

12:01.971 --> 12:03.472
[Douxie] Hey, girl.

12:03.848 --> 12:04.890
Just gonna...

12:04.974 --> 12:08.269
Just gonna come in
for a quick little milking.

12:09.186 --> 12:13.065
-Just gonna be one little squeeze.
-[squishes]

12:13.149 --> 12:14.567
[Slorr roars]

12:14.650 --> 12:16.110
[Douxie] No, no, no! Aah!

12:16.193 --> 12:17.278
[Slorr roars]

12:17.361 --> 12:19.530
[Douxie crying, whining]

12:19.613 --> 12:21.240
It's in my mouth!

12:22.700 --> 12:25.536
Uh... Morgana?

12:26.537 --> 12:28.622
Reporting for handmaiden duty.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.166
Hello?

12:30.875 --> 12:31.834
Morgana?

12:32.710 --> 12:33.711
Hello?

12:37.673 --> 12:38.841
The Shadow Staff.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.053
-[Morgana] Aren't you curious?
-[door closes]

12:43.137 --> 12:47.057
My new handmaiden,
familiar with dark magics.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.685
-I saw it in the court.
-What? N-No.

12:49.768 --> 12:52.229
-That was just--
-What do you know of the Shadows?

12:52.313 --> 12:54.231
No idea what you're talking about.
[chuckles]

12:54.315 --> 12:56.525
Don't play coy, little lamb.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.862
You're hiding your knowledge
from me and from Arthur.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.364
You stood against my brother
to save a Troll,

13:02.448 --> 13:05.117
a magical creature like myself,
like us.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.078
The others fear our potential
and would quash it.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.581
But I do not fear magic.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.249
It is true strength.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.584
[chimes]

13:18.130 --> 13:21.175
<i>Aurai capernus umbra!</i>

13:28.933 --> 13:29.767
[gasps]

13:32.728 --> 13:33.646
[sighs]

13:33.729 --> 13:37.775
Will I ever be strong enough to save
those who are different from his wrath?

13:39.276 --> 13:40.986
You're stronger than you know.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.782
Maybe you could convince him,
your brother, to change,

13:44.990 --> 13:46.325
to set them all free.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.619
He was a good man once...

13:49.286 --> 13:50.871
but after he lost Gwen,

13:50.955 --> 13:54.083
the scars on his face
now match the scars on his heart.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.584
Why would he listen to me now?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.087
Because people can surprise you sometimes.

13:58.837 --> 14:03.342
He's too arrogant to see his war
is misguided, but I must act.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.094
Arthur's bloodshed ends today.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.721
What is this treason you speak?

14:07.805 --> 14:10.307
-Brother! I only meant--
-I've heard enough!

14:11.058 --> 14:12.643
Your sympathies blind you.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.646
These savage beasts never cease
to attack us on sight!

14:15.729 --> 14:18.232
Because you drive them from their homes,

14:18.399 --> 14:22.486
imprison them in the dungeon below,
and don't expect them to come for us?

14:23.445 --> 14:25.614
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Arthur sighs]

14:26.156 --> 14:27.116
You're right.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.909
I've lost enough to them.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.872
I'll not endanger my people
by keeping enemies within these walls!

14:32.955 --> 14:34.915
Yes. Wait. Wait, you wouldn't--

14:34.999 --> 14:38.002
We destroy those monsters at dawn.

14:38.627 --> 14:39.461
No.

14:39.795 --> 14:43.924
I, uh-- I forgot how much
I hate milking the Slorr.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.259
[sniffs, gags]

14:45.342 --> 14:47.011
-Ugh! Please!
-[Steve groans]

14:47.094 --> 14:49.763
I think Lancelot broke my everything.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.391
-[wheezes]
-And I still don't have the Time Map.

14:52.474 --> 14:56.228
One wrong move, and we will screw up
history without even knowing it.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.314
-[door opens, closes]
-We have to change history!

14:58.606 --> 15:01.650
Arthur's had enough.
The Trolls are gonna die at sunrise!

15:01.859 --> 15:03.235
Oh, blimey Balroths!

15:03.319 --> 15:06.071
How are we supposed to stop this
and stay inconspicuous?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.866
It wouldn't be a problem
if I just had my Shadow Staff.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.869
I know you said to lay low,
but we can't let Jim die.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.831
Yes. Let's see what this future Douxie
is capable of.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.291
You're right, sod the rules.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.043
It's time for a dungeon break.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.504
[both laughing]

15:22.922 --> 15:25.174
-[Galahad] No way!
-[Lancelot] Ah! Oy!

15:25.257 --> 15:29.553
Young gentleman of Palchukia,
join us in our nocturnal libations.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.806
We are looking for the Holy Grail!

15:32.890 --> 15:34.183
[slurping]

15:34.266 --> 15:36.685
Oh, well, it's not in that one either!

15:36.769 --> 15:38.562
-[both laugh]
-[Steve chuckles]

15:38.646 --> 15:40.940
Where do you think you're going,
buddy boy?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.483
Dude, I'm keeping the guards busy...

15:42.566 --> 15:44.610
[whispers] while having
a righteous time! Ha!

15:44.860 --> 15:47.029
Yeah-heah! Drinking with knights!

15:47.112 --> 15:49.949
I'm so stoked
for my first brew... uh, today.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.617
[Galahad] Pucker up, buttercup.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.203
This be my onion brew.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.039
It'll put some hair on your everywhere!

15:57.122 --> 15:58.374
-[laughs]
-[nervous laugh] Cool.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.625
-[gurgles]
-[Steve] Uh...

15:59.708 --> 16:02.044
[knights chanting] Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

16:02.127 --> 16:03.837
-This is going to end badly.
-Drink!

16:03.921 --> 16:05.172
-Ooh, I can't wait.
-[cheers]

16:05.255 --> 16:07.716
For the glory of Merlin... [grunts]

16:07.800 --> 16:11.804
- For the glory of Merlin...
-Ugh, stop saying that name.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.390
Merlin's in league with the fleshbags
who put us here.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.809
I'm trying to manifest
a Sword of Daylight.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.186
He made it to save the Trolls.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.814
Pfft, those guards must have hit you
harder than I thought, kid.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.650
-Nobody's saving anybody here.
-[Claire] Jim!

16:24.900 --> 16:26.193
We're breaking you out.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.196
Your stay in Terror Tower is over, mate.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.616
And presto, one liberated Troll.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.246
Take that, death!
I elude you once again--

16:37.329 --> 16:38.706
-Shh!

Quick, through the alleys!

This way, sir! Don't worry, sire,
I'll freeze them on the spot.

Oh, fuzz buckets!

18:35.823 --> 18:38.075

You know how frustrating magic is.

the right spell.

[Gunmar growls]

[roars]

20:33.232 --> 20:35.525
Who wanders into my woods?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.403
-[horse neighs]
-Hold, men! Hold!

20:38.487 --> 20:39.404
Gunmar?

20:40.530 --> 20:44.576
Little king, these Wild Woods
are my domain.

20:44.952 --> 20:48.789
I command the souls
of all under its shade,

20:48.872 --> 20:53.752
-and I decide who lives or dies!

20:56.088 --> 20:59.716
You can only push us so far, human.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.802
-[horse neighs]
-This isn't over!

21:02.302 --> 21:04.972
War is coming!

21:06.723 --> 21:10.060
Can't believe I'm saying this,
but thank you, Morgana.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.020
Thank you, handmaiden.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.272
You inspired me.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.648
Now keep your head down.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.149
I will handle my brother.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.485
Arthur is furious.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.903
He's locked down the castle.

21:19.987 --> 21:23.699
Luckily, he thinks you're so incompetent,
you can't be a suspect.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.576
At least we got Jim
and the prisoners away safe.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.204
-Where are you going?
-To get that Time Map.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.789
Hopefully with Arthur on the hunt,

21:30.872 --> 21:33.375
I've got a chance
to finally snatch that thing.

-[gasps]

21:56.356 --> 21:58.608
Or perhaps this?

22:00.485 --> 22:02.779
Oh, fuzz buckets!
