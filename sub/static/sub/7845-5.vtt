00:07.204 --> 00:09.039
There it is.

00:09.041 --> 00:10.541
Valencia.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.077
How do you think this should go down?

00:12.078 --> 00:15.078
Do you think I should save the kingdom
and then rescue Madalena?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.647
Or do you think
I should rescue, then save?

00:16.648 --> 00:19.750
'Cause I just want it to have
a dramatic build, you know?

00:19.751 --> 00:21.385
I mean, either way,

00:21.386 --> 00:23.120
we're all gonna live happily ever after.

00:23.121 --> 00:24.488
Yep.

00:24.489 --> 00:25.823
I'm sure that's exactly how
it's going to be.

00:25.824 --> 00:27.224
Especially the living part.

00:27.225 --> 00:28.659
For you.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.628
No reason why you wouldn't keep on living.

00:30.629 --> 00:32.697

01:05.129 --> 01:07.665
He'll be here tonight as the sun has cast

01:07.666 --> 01:09.733
its last shadow upon the earth

01:09.734 --> 01:13.070
and the crescent moon is risen
above the Eastern Ridge.

01:13.071 --> 01:14.738
So, like 9:00?

01:15.840 --> 01:17.741
Yes, Gareth, he'll be here at 9:00.

01:17.742 --> 01:20.177
And I cannot wait!

01:20.178 --> 01:22.580

and then finally bed

sack of deformities

01:31.823 --> 01:33.157
known as my hand maiden?

01:33.158 --> 01:34.358
My hair is a disaster.

01:34.359 --> 01:36.427
Gwynne?

01:36.428 --> 01:37.528
My hair!

01:37.529 --> 01:39.063
Forgive me, My Queen.

01:40.865 --> 01:42.700
Was that too much to ask?

01:44.669 --> 01:47.037
Just think about it, hmm?

01:47.038 --> 01:50.474
We could, uh, we could do
a picnic, you know?

01:50.475 --> 01:51.875
Something super cazh.

01:51.876 --> 01:55.242
For the hundredth time, no.

01:55.244 --> 01:59.049
Your mouth is saying no, but I can see
your rotten teeth through that smile.

01:59.050 --> 02:00.289
Go on, you!

02:01.152 --> 02:03.053
She's going to be so surprised!

02:03.054 --> 02:05.289
No, she's not because you keep doing

02:05.290 --> 02:07.491
that stupid "evil king whisper" thing

02:07.492 --> 02:08.824
that everyone can hear.

02:08.826 --> 02:10.860
- How about this?
- Lower.

02:10.862 --> 02:12.462
- How about this?
- Oh, please.

02:12.463 --> 02:13.897
Oh, come on. That was good.

02:13.898 --> 02:15.799
For God's sakes, Gareth.
You're allowed to laugh.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.200
What are you two yabbering about?

02:17.201 --> 02:20.037
Nothing, darling. Nothing going on.

02:20.038 --> 02:22.806
That's right. There is nothing going on.

02:22.807 --> 02:25.175

wretched kingdom a year ago!

of... working themselves out.

02:36.654 --> 02:38.722
Normally when I yell at you,
you get tummy cramps

02:38.723 --> 02:40.857
and have to go poopy... your words.

02:40.858 --> 02:42.659
What can I say?

02:42.660 --> 02:46.029
I'm sleeping well, exercising,
laying off the wheat.

05:05.886 --> 05:08.788
The sun's almost perfect
for hero lighting.

05:08.789 --> 05:10.390
I should do some push-ups.

to storm the castle later?

05:13.894 --> 05:15.695

are quite hard to rhyme with.

not to ask too many questions.

07:58.925 --> 08:01.060
You're close with the king, aren't you?

08:01.061 --> 08:04.997

but I'm not even sure
we could both fit into my bed.

08:30.056 --> 08:31.390

08:44.704 --> 08:45.971
Okay.

08:45.972 --> 08:48.674
The king is having a secret meeting

08:48.675 --> 08:50.809
where I'm to serve snacks
and a light refreshment

08:50.810 --> 08:53.178
as soon as the croaks of the frogs

08:53.179 --> 08:55.080
usher in the raven's last call.

08:55.081 --> 08:56.815
So, like 9:00?

08:56.816 --> 08:58.350
Yeah, 9:00.

08:58.351 --> 08:59.651
Excellent.

08:59.652 --> 09:01.387
Take me there.

09:01.388 --> 09:03.389
Yes, m'lady.

09:03.390 --> 09:06.625
And King Richard said
if I didn't bring the jewel

09:06.626 --> 09:08.660
and Galavant back, he'd kill my parents.

09:08.661 --> 09:10.028
So, I lied to Galavant

09:10.029 --> 09:11.897
and told him
that the queen still loved him.

09:11.898 --> 09:13.999
He's walking into a trap of my own making!

09:14.000 --> 09:15.701

So, basically, you made a deal
with the evil king,

09:29.582 --> 09:31.917
but that was before you fell
for the handsome knight...

09:31.918 --> 09:34.019

I'm never gonna be able

09:36.089 --> 09:37.656
to make it back in time
for their big finish.

09:37.657 --> 09:39.291
But I need your advice.

09:39.292 --> 09:41.059
I'm supposed to bring Galavant to the king

09:41.060 --> 09:43.895
when the barking of the hounds
wakens the fairies in the evening

09:43.896 --> 09:45.797
so that they may begin
their nocturnal dance.

09:45.798 --> 09:47.966

09:47.967 --> 09:50.369
Yeah. 9:00.

09:52.572 --> 09:56.842
It's 9:03. Why am I the only one
who's ever on time?

09:58.344 --> 10:00.746
There should be a standardized system

10:00.747 --> 10:03.281
based on the rotation of the earth

10:03.282 --> 10:06.418
in relation to its position
to the sun and the moon.

10:06.419 --> 10:08.653
You sound like a witch.

10:08.654 --> 10:11.890
Regardless, it is very rude of Galavant

10:11.891 --> 10:13.892
to be late to his own killing.

10:13.893 --> 10:15.861
Galavant's coming?

10:15.862 --> 10:17.829
The king didn't give me a head count.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.998
Oh, I came up with the most <i> perfect</i> line

10:19.999 --> 10:21.600
for when I first see him.

10:21.601 --> 10:24.069
In my most intimidating voice,
I'm going to say,

10:24.070 --> 10:27.472
"Well, well, well"...

10:27.473 --> 10:29.040
Nope. I'm gonna save it.

10:30.076 --> 10:31.242
Oh. Here we go.

10:33.746 --> 10:36.014
Well, well...

10:37.183 --> 10:39.651
- Where the hell's Galavant?
- There's been a change in plans.

10:39.652 --> 10:42.787
You'll get the jewel
and set my parents free,

10:42.788 --> 10:44.255
but Galavant stays alive.

10:44.256 --> 10:46.157
I see.

10:46.158 --> 10:48.193
How utterly predictable.

10:48.194 --> 10:51.362
The princess has fallen
for the noble knight.

10:51.363 --> 10:53.264
Of course she has.

10:53.265 --> 10:55.233
I can't let a guy like that live.

10:55.234 --> 10:56.601
Well, then the deal is off.

10:56.602 --> 10:58.203
You'll never see the jewel again.

10:58.204 --> 11:01.139
You're adorable.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.574
No, my darling.

11:02.575 --> 11:05.343
You see, you will bring me Galavant

11:05.344 --> 11:10.086
<i>and</i> the jewel or else
you'll suffer the same fate...

11:10.088 --> 11:12.150
As your parents!

11:13.386 --> 11:16.422
- It's all right, honey.
- We're alive.

11:16.422 --> 11:17.344
What?!

11:17.346 --> 11:19.724
The king convinced us it would be funny.

11:19.725 --> 11:21.993
We've been prisoners a long time.

11:21.994 --> 11:23.494
We lost perspective.

11:23.495 --> 11:26.631
You should have seen your face!

11:26.632 --> 11:27.999
You were like, "aah!"

11:29.201 --> 11:30.334
"Ooh!"

11:30.335 --> 11:31.969
Oh, but make no mistake.

11:31.970 --> 11:33.838
If you don't bring me Galavant,
I will kill them.

11:35.140 --> 11:36.674
For realsies.

11:39.491 --> 11:43.558
♪ And we're the Monks,
hey, hey, we're the Monks ♪

11:43.560 --> 11:46.293
♪ Yeah ♪

11:46.295 --> 11:47.562
What's happening?

11:47.563 --> 11:48.897
I'll tell you what's happening.

11:48.898 --> 11:50.342
Our Sid sings like a freaking angel.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.467
No, this plan, this whole thing.

11:52.468 --> 11:55.337
- How did it come to this?
- Princess, relax.

11:55.338 --> 11:56.872
It's gonna go great.

11:56.873 --> 11:59.875
They already expect these guys
to perform at the castle.

11:59.876 --> 12:01.438
We're just gonna sneak in with them

12:01.440 --> 12:03.441
and infiltrate from the inside.

12:05.715 --> 12:07.716
Turns out you were right.

12:07.717 --> 12:09.851
As usual, I needed a better plan.

12:09.852 --> 12:11.186
Galavant...

12:11.187 --> 12:13.154
I'm only magnanimous once every 10 years,

12:13.155 --> 12:14.789
so just let this happen.

12:14.790 --> 12:17.759
You saw the best in me and...

12:17.760 --> 12:21.852
Ultimately reminded me what
it means to be a real knight.

12:22.031 --> 12:23.098
And here we are.

12:23.099 --> 12:25.567
So, thank you...

12:25.568 --> 12:29.838
For bringing me back to me.

12:29.839 --> 12:33.975
Against all the odds, it's, um...

12:33.976 --> 12:36.878
Well, it's been a pleasure.

12:36.879 --> 12:40.982
You really don't
have to thank me for anything.

12:40.983 --> 12:45.153
You actually have
a lot of nice qualities...

12:45.154 --> 12:46.388
All on your own.

12:47.189 --> 12:48.857
Careful, princess.

12:48.858 --> 12:50.859
You're getting dangerously close
to paying me a compliment.

12:50.860 --> 12:53.361
I can do compliments.

12:53.362 --> 12:56.331
I mean, you know your way around a horse,

12:56.332 --> 12:59.400
you're not so bad with a sword,

12:59.401 --> 13:02.470
and your beard magically stays
the same length all the time.

13:04.006 --> 13:09.077
And... you have an ability to see
the best in people

13:09.078 --> 13:11.513
even after they've wronged you.

13:13.582 --> 13:16.417
Like with Madalena.

13:16.418 --> 13:18.119
Right.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.787
Madalena.

13:19.788 --> 13:24.092
Oh, man, this robe
is really itching my junk.

13:24.093 --> 13:26.661
Oh, you left your clothes on underneath.

13:26.662 --> 13:27.829
Right.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here

13:39.441 --> 13:42.076
I hope you're pleased
with what I've shown you.

13:42.077 --> 13:43.578
Judging by the pressure

13:43.579 --> 13:46.114
and what seems like the amount
of exclamation points,

13:46.115 --> 13:47.949
it's a little hard to tell.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.717
This is the writing of a happy queen

13:49.718 --> 13:53.121
who's decided to take control
and set a secret, evil plan in motion.

13:53.122 --> 13:54.789
Ooh!

13:54.790 --> 13:58.459
Let's keep that last part
just between the two of us.

13:58.460 --> 14:00.228
For your fastest pigeon.

14:00.229 --> 14:04.031
This absolutely, positively
has to be there overnight.

14:04.032 --> 14:07.835
You upheld your end of the
bargain, so I'll uphold mine.

14:07.837 --> 14:10.839
You have my permission to make
the most romantic of meals tonight

14:10.839 --> 14:12.406
for you and my hand maiden.

14:12.407 --> 14:14.375
Spare no expense...
Fresh oysters, braised rabbit,

14:14.376 --> 14:16.277
and a nice Bordeaux
from my private cellar.

14:16.278 --> 14:18.379
Oh, I don't even know if she'll say yes.

14:18.380 --> 14:21.782
I mean, we flirt and stuff,
but when I ask her on a date, bubkes.

14:21.783 --> 14:24.018
God, do I have to do everything
around here?

14:24.019 --> 14:25.853
Gwynne!

14:25.854 --> 14:28.289
You're having dinner tonight
with smallpox over here.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.191
Yes, m'lady.

14:30.192 --> 14:32.393
You two aren't cousins
or anything, are you?

14:32.394 --> 14:35.496
Ah, who cares? You guys couldn't
get any weirder looking.

14:40.535 --> 14:42.403
I know a hook-up from your boss

14:42.404 --> 14:44.839
isn't the smoothest thing, but...

14:44.840 --> 14:46.874
I don't care.

14:46.875 --> 14:50.211
Because, truthfully, I think
we could be great together.

14:50.212 --> 14:53.647
But love isn't meant for people like us.

You bring that pretty
little smile of yours,

16:52.333 --> 16:54.100
and I'll supply the rest.

16:54.101 --> 16:56.369
Yes!

17:06.414 --> 17:10.183
Right, princess. You ready
to get your kingdom back?

17:10.184 --> 17:11.818
I've been thinking.

17:11.819 --> 17:14.054
I can get another kingdom.
It's a buyer's market right now.

17:14.055 --> 17:15.521
Let's just free my parents,

17:15.522 --> 17:16.723
get Madalena, and get us out of here.

17:16.723 --> 17:17.891
Absolutely not.

17:17.892 --> 17:20.492
When I make a promise, I keep it.

17:20.493 --> 17:22.028
We're gonna get your kingdom back.

17:22.029 --> 17:23.396
- But...
- Once the concert starts,

17:23.396 --> 17:25.732
we're gonna have about an hour
to move about the castle.

17:25.733 --> 17:27.133
Where do you think
they're keeping your parents?

17:27.134 --> 17:31.070
Perhaps they're up your butt.

17:31.071 --> 17:34.174
Y-you see, because
that's the most unlikely place.

17:34.175 --> 17:37.409
I mean, obviously, her parents
couldn't be up your...

17:37.411 --> 17:39.245
Well, well, well.

17:39.246 --> 17:41.714
Ah, it's too late.
I had to go for the stupid butt joke.

17:41.715 --> 17:43.616
Forget it. Guards, just seize them.

17:51.458 --> 17:52.892
Your move...

17:52.893 --> 17:54.961
'Cause I haven't killed anybody all day.

17:54.962 --> 17:57.363
Gareth, we agreed
<i>I</i> would say the cool things.

17:57.364 --> 18:00.428
- So, what's it gonna be?
- Damn it, Gareth!

18:01.607 --> 18:02.769
Fine.

18:02.770 --> 18:04.036
Galavant, no!

18:04.037 --> 18:05.705
Now let her go.

18:05.706 --> 18:07.507
She had nothing to do with this.

18:07.508 --> 18:10.443
You are <i> so</i> noble.

18:10.444 --> 18:12.111
And yet the women in your life

18:12.112 --> 18:13.880
never seem to honor that nobility.

18:13.881 --> 18:17.083
In fact, this one tricked you
into coming all the way here

18:17.084 --> 18:18.518
so I could kill you.

18:21.555 --> 18:22.588
What?

18:23.957 --> 18:26.726
Well, well, well...

18:26.727 --> 18:29.462
Looks like it's time for dinner.

18:29.463 --> 18:32.264
- Nailed it.
- Boom.

18:35.254 --> 18:39.087
But... what the... all that time...

18:39.089 --> 18:41.157
He may not be able to talk, but I can.

18:41.158 --> 18:42.792
This is messed up, princess!

18:42.794 --> 18:44.962
I didn't have a choice.
He was going to kill my parents.

18:44.962 --> 18:46.162
Shut up!

18:47.498 --> 18:50.800
Well, seems like you kids
have lots to talk about.

18:50.801 --> 18:52.702
I'll let you get to it.

18:52.703 --> 18:54.137
Oh, but do hurry.

18:54.138 --> 18:56.606
I'm executing Galavant in 10 minutes. Hmm.

18:56.607 --> 18:59.342
It's nice to finally
have people down here.

18:59.343 --> 19:00.810
Feels lived in.

19:00.811 --> 19:04.180
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you, but I...

19:04.181 --> 19:06.315
But what?

19:06.316 --> 19:08.139
You didn't have time?

19:08.185 --> 19:09.886
Not in the hundreds of miles we traveled

19:09.887 --> 19:11.587
or the meals we shared?

19:11.588 --> 19:15.858
In retrospect, the trip
through the forest of honesty

19:15.859 --> 19:17.360
would have seemed like
an appropriate time.

19:17.361 --> 19:18.928
But my family.

19:18.929 --> 19:22.699
Well, perhaps if you'd told me,
we could have made a plan.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.834
And you would have helped me?

19:24.835 --> 19:26.969
Even if you had nothing to gain from it?

19:26.970 --> 19:30.907
I guess we'll never find out.

19:33.377 --> 19:35.778
If even a single ounce of you was real,

19:35.779 --> 19:37.346
just tell me one thing...

19:37.347 --> 19:39.282
Did Madalena want me to come for her?

19:39.283 --> 19:41.584
I don't know.

19:45.389 --> 19:46.522
No!

20:09.212 --> 20:11.814
Not so tough, are you now,

20:11.815 --> 20:12.848
Galavan...

20:14.198 --> 20:15.084
Aah!!

20:15.085 --> 20:17.186
Aah!!

20:23.794 --> 20:26.595
Hello, darling.

20:26.596 --> 20:28.097
Madalena?

20:29.700 --> 20:34.103
There's braised rabbit
and Bordeaux, your favorites.

20:34.104 --> 20:36.739
<i>You</i> saved me?

20:36.740 --> 20:38.707
Oh, I've done a lot more than that.

20:44.347 --> 20:46.482
We have a lot of catching up to do.

20:48.433 --> 20:51.153
I've written someone,

20:51.154 --> 20:53.856
and he's coming to execute my plan.

20:53.857 --> 20:55.758
He doesn't play nice.

20:59.362 --> 21:01.515
Everything's about to change.
