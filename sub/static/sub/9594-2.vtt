WEBVTT

00:23.157 --> 00:24.425
He's all mine!

00:42.543 --> 00:44.078
Stay with us, Beast Boy.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.613
We are not losing you today!

00:48.216 --> 00:49.583
Raven, bone saw!

00:49.683 --> 00:51.352
Bone saw.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.356
-Pliers.
-Pliers.

00:55.456 --> 00:59.327
-Removing foreign object.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.330
Ugh... Foreign object removed.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.466
Oh, man!
My face, my face!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
Okay, Beast Boy,
lower your hands.

01:07.668 --> 01:08.836
I'm sure it's not so...

01:08.936 --> 01:10.371
So bad!

01:10.471 --> 01:11.672
So, so very bad.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.310
Ahhh!

01:16.410 --> 01:19.079
Bandages,
we need bandages.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.516
This is going to
take a while to heal.

01:24.885 --> 01:28.456
All right, Beast Boy,
let's see how you're
healing over there.

01:30.358 --> 01:33.093
His glornup is
blorthing everywhere.

01:33.194 --> 01:36.430
-Ahhh! Cover him up,
cover him up.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.872
Okay.
Here we go.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.341
Oh, it's finally healed.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.243
BEAST BOY:
But how does it look?

01:50.444 --> 01:53.414
Oh, man!
The scar is huge.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.684
My face is ruined!

01:58.752 --> 02:01.689
Come on, Beastie,
it's not that bad.
Right, guys?

02:04.292 --> 02:06.160
-Uh...
-Uh...

02:13.501 --> 02:14.702
Hmm.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.439
I think it makes
you look tough.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.442
Yeah, right dude!

02:21.542 --> 02:23.677
I'm serious.
Who's the toughest
person you know?

02:23.777 --> 02:25.246
Raven.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.549
Who's the toughest
man person you know?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.285
You're the toughest
man person I know.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.421
Booyah!

02:33.521 --> 02:35.523
And do you think
I started out that way? Nope.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.591
I used to be an average
normal looking Joe,

02:37.691 --> 02:39.693
minding my own
business when suddenly...

02:40.694 --> 02:41.695
Ahhh!

02:41.795 --> 02:43.831
Fire!
Brimstone.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.333
Why?

02:45.433 --> 02:47.268
My body got all messed up
in some crazy accident.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.737
Then my Papa
hooked me up with
these awesome robot parts

02:49.837 --> 02:51.872
and that's what
makes me tough.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.641
The scars man.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.309
The scars!

02:56.244 --> 02:57.311
For reals?

02:57.411 --> 02:59.580
Yes, for the reals,
Beast Boy.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.182
Hey, what's up
with that ostrich?

03:02.283 --> 03:03.784
Why's he so manly, huh?

03:03.884 --> 03:06.687
Oh, it's just the
rad scar on his

03:06.787 --> 03:08.289
face!

03:09.523 --> 03:13.594
Uh-oh!
I think we got some
tough times ahead of us.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.277
Ooh! Ah!

03:32.580 --> 03:34.248
Ooh!

03:49.029 --> 03:50.831
WOMEN: Hi there, toughster!

03:59.407 --> 04:01.375
Dr. Light is on
a rampage down-town.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.676
Titans, go!

04:20.628 --> 04:21.729
Whoo-hoo!

04:27.535 --> 04:29.337
Whoa! That was tough!

04:29.437 --> 04:30.838
Thank the scars.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.281
Beast Boy, look out.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.650
Ahhh!

04:51.392 --> 04:53.827
Bandages! We need
more bandages!

04:55.529 --> 04:57.565
Don't worry!
I got you, Beastie.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.506
You're lucky your
animal super powers are
keeping your arm alive.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.975
So gross.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.778
While we figure out
how to reattach it
this should help you.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.316
Hey, it's gonna be
okay, Beast Boy.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.351
I know.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.752
Don't let this bum you out.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.987
It won't.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.723
Are you not upset with
the loss of your appendage?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.925
Nope, now I have this
sweet robot arm

05:25.025 --> 05:26.694
to go with my manly scar.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.032
-Okay that is the coolest
thing I've ever seen.
-Amazing.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.501
So hot.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.035
What was that, Ray Ray?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.336
Nothing.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.876
Robot arms are
tough and all

05:42.976 --> 05:45.112
but losing body parts
is not a good thing.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.447
Worked out for you.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.681
Maybe Cyborg's right.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.483
We'll work to reattach...

05:51.885 --> 05:52.886
Ah, ow!

05:58.158 --> 06:00.761
Beast Boy,
you are not laughing?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.663
Beast Boy might have
thought that was funny.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.933
But I'm a man now.
Scar Man.

06:10.871 --> 06:11.905
Whoa!

06:16.644 --> 06:17.911
Uh!

06:18.011 --> 06:19.513
Argh!

06:25.519 --> 06:27.387
What is it with Beast Boy
getting his arm

06:27.488 --> 06:28.989
blown off on purpose?

06:29.089 --> 06:30.424
You mean Scar Man.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.392
His name is Beast Boy.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.097
That is no boy.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.499
I was just trying
to cheer him up

06:38.599 --> 06:39.733
by telling him
scars were cool,

06:39.833 --> 06:41.969
but now he has
taken it too far.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.939
BEAST BOY: Hey,
my man, keep these
on ice for me. Thanks.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.808
What's in here?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.177
Oh, you know, just
some lame body parts
I'm not using anymore.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.412
Ahhh!

06:52.513 --> 06:53.814
What did you do, Beast Boy?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.949
Just made myself
a little tougher.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.526
And it's Scar Man.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.800
You can say that again.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.668
Scar Man.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.604
Whoa!

07:16.704 --> 07:18.005
You do not get it.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.172
Oh, I get it.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.974
I used to have
a little kid arm,

07:21.074 --> 07:22.442
and a little kid leg,

07:22.543 --> 07:24.545
and now I'm bigger
and manlier than ever.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.113
This is not an improvement.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.681
Did you say something?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.851
Couldn't hear you
over my manliness.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.955
Darn! Darn!

07:38.759 --> 07:40.861
We gotta get those
body parts back.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.476
Ahhh!

08:12.059 --> 08:13.527
Uh!

08:23.871 --> 08:25.272
Good news bro.

08:25.372 --> 08:28.542
I figured out
how to reattach
all your body parts.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.177
Can't hear you.

08:30.277 --> 08:34.214
It's a simple
procedure and you'll
be back to your old self.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.617
I prefer to remain
awesome, thanks.

08:36.717 --> 08:40.087
One sec.
Blast power!

08:40.187 --> 08:43.791
Excuse me,
I'm taking this
party sky high.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.593
WOMAN'S VOICE: Sky high!

08:49.663 --> 08:51.098
There has to be a way
to make him realize

08:51.198 --> 08:53.901
what he's done to
his body is terrible.

09:09.082 --> 09:12.019
Hey, Beast Boy,
look at me.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.955
Look at how tough
I've made myself.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.556
Ooh!

09:16.657 --> 09:18.959
Crab claws.
Clickety clickety click.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.193
So tough.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.062
And check out these
horse haunches.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.865
Manly enough for you?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.235
What'd you do to
yourself, Cyborg?

09:28.335 --> 09:30.137
I'm teaching you a lesson.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.106
That cutting off body
parts and replacing
them with other parts

09:33.206 --> 09:34.608
just ain't cool.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.276
Whatevs.

09:36.376 --> 09:40.013
Taking care of yourself
is more important than
looking tough, man.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.716
Uh-huh, sure.
You done yet?

09:43.216 --> 09:45.619
Yeah, I'm done.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.596
Uh, I'm sorry.
Maybe you're right, bro.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.933
I guess I got kinda
carried away in my
pursuit of toughness.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.272
I think we both got
a little carried away.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.643
You do look pretty
tough though dude.

10:09.743 --> 10:10.944
This looks tough?

10:11.044 --> 10:13.180
You just upped your
man factor five times.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.354
Hey, what else can we do
to up our man factors?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.156
Only one way to find out.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.649
BEASTY BOY: Oh, so manly, yo.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.719
WOMAN: So manly.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.121
Yo, that is one tough sunset.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.057
Just like us bro,
just like us.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.191
Tough!
