WANT TO GO?

31:40.933 --> 31:44.568

HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER

WHERE SHE CAN'T MAKE HER USING
OR NOT USING

31:52.444 --> 31:54.211

I COULD GO WITH YOU.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.390
I WOULD LIKE
TO MAKE MY OWN EVALUATION,

AND...MAYBE I CAN HELP
STEER THE CONVERSATION

TELL ME EVERYTHING?

THAT I WOULDN'T FIND OUT?

THE WITNESS RECANTED.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.343
IT MEANS THAT HE TOOK BACK
WHAT HE SAID.

SEE ANYTHING THAT NIGHT.

Flynn: CESAR PADILLA.

YOU REMEMBER HIM.
YOU'VE BEEN INTIMIDATING HIM

GIVING HER FLOWERS,

34:06.478 --> 34:08.478

WE USED TO LAUGH AT HIM

34:08.480 --> 34:10.981
BECAUSE HE NEVER
HAD A CHANCE WITH ANA.

34:10.983 --> 34:12.883
SHE WAS
ALL ABOUT DANTE.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.851
WHEN WE GOT THE CALL
ABOUT ANA THAT NIGHT,

34:14.853 --> 34:17.354
HE CAME OVER TO THE HOUSE
ALL CRYING AND EVERYTHING.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.724
WHY WOULD HE LIE ABOUT DANTE
AND THEN TAKE IT ALL BACK?

34:30.435 --> 34:32.769
OOPS. LOOKS LIKE
I'M TAKING YOU THE WRONG WAY.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.338

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY IF YOU DO WANT.

HE NEVER TESTIFIED
UNDER OATH,

YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT.
