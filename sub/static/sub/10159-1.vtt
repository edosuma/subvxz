WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:04.054
You don't just disappear
in your final term.

00:04.236 --> 00:06.111
What are you doing?

00:06.806 --> 00:08.604
I'm searching for clues. I think

00:08.606 --> 00:11.655
it's got to the point where we
need to call someone about Howard.

00:11.657 --> 00:14.911
It's two days into term.
And where is he? What if he's dead?

00:14.913 --> 00:17.109
He's probably just been held up
at the border.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.229
Not allowed back in
since they went independent?

00:19.230 --> 00:22.149
- Scotland didn't go independent, JP.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure they did.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.829
He's probably up in Aberdeen,

00:23.830 --> 00:27.069
sat on a Trident,
bathing in the Queen's oil.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.029
Do you ever even watch the news?

00:29.030 --> 00:31.749
Kingsley, only maniac bore-holes
watch the news

00:31.750 --> 00:34.549
when it's not the Olympics
or a big war.

00:35.750 --> 00:39.750
With your pretentious imported
cereals and your big, boring book.

00:40.070 --> 00:42.829
Infinite Jest's Notes And Errata
are a greater contribution to

00:42.830 --> 00:45.869
literature than the entire oeuvre
of your Joanne Kimberley Rowling.

00:45.870 --> 00:47.149
Fascinating.

00:47.150 --> 00:49.429
I mean, I, I think I... er,
dropped off a little bit

00:49.430 --> 00:51.949
during the sentence,
but otherwise, very interesting.

00:51.950 --> 00:53.789
OK, that's enough
of the bullying now!

00:53.790 --> 00:56.829
Josie, you don't have to suck up
to him any more. You're free.

00:56.830 --> 00:59.109
No more boring Italian films!

00:59.110 --> 01:02.429
I liked Italian film night.

01:02.430 --> 01:06.430
Fellini is a modern master who...

01:06.550 --> 01:10.550
...er, something, something,
something, something. Right?

01:12.550 --> 01:15.669
Yeah. Look, JP. Right,
at a certain point in your life,

01:15.670 --> 01:18.989
basically when you grow up, your
differences stop being weaknesses.

01:18.990 --> 01:21.949
They become eccentricities. Foibles.

01:21.950 --> 01:25.869
"Oh, hello, is that Mr Foibleman?
Yes, Michael Foibleman?

01:25.870 --> 01:28.829
"A man who eats American cornflakes
because he thinks it makes him

01:28.830 --> 01:30.949
"more interesting."

01:35.070 --> 01:37.989
What kind of time is
this for a doorbell?

01:37.990 --> 01:41.990
That is insane.

01:45.350 --> 01:49.350
Tomothy? Great to see you, bro,
but, erm, no heads-up?

01:50.710 --> 01:52.989
Oh, sorry, man, yeah.

01:52.990 --> 01:55.749
You got a lecture you need to be at
or some shit?

01:55.750 --> 01:59.109
- Er, no, actually I don't...
- Oh, really - that's interesting.

01:59.110 --> 02:01.149
Because I checked the geology
schedule online

02:01.150 --> 02:04.349
and you've got a crystallography
lecture in about, er, no minutes.

02:04.350 --> 02:07.069
- Er, no, because...
- Because?

02:07.070 --> 02:09.669
- Because it's can celled today.
- Why?

02:09.669 --> 02:12.349
- Because of illness.
- Whose?
- The man.

02:12.350 --> 02:14.909
- The man. Professor Paterson?
- Yes.
- Who I just made up?

02:14.910 --> 02:16.749
No. Yes. I don't know.

02:16.750 --> 02:20.069
- You don't know?
- No, I do. I don't.

02:20.070 --> 02:22.309
I'm lying, I can't keep up.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.909
Well, it's third year, buddy,
finals!

02:24.910 --> 02:27.509
You need to sort yourself
the fuck out, JP.

02:27.510 --> 02:31.510
And that's what I'm here,
in this arctic climate, to do.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.830 --> 03:01.309
- Oh, my God, Tomothy is here!
- Tomothy is here?

03:01.310 --> 03:03.909
Tomothy is here. My bro.

03:03.910 --> 03:05.949
Mummy wanted Tom.
Daddy wanted Timothy.

03:05.950 --> 03:08.789
- Tomothy.
- Tomothy has a razor brain
and an acid tongue.

03:08.790 --> 03:11.749
He is very fucking "wow".
Just act normal.

03:11.750 --> 03:15.669
No, wait, act clever.
Talk! About the euro and... Fuck!

03:15.670 --> 03:19.670
- JP, relax.
- He's very organised.
But he's also incredibly chilled.

03:20.070 --> 03:22.589
- He hates ditherers. He'll like you.
- I don't give a fuck.

03:22.590 --> 03:24.709
That is just the kind of attitude
Tomothy loves.

03:24.710 --> 03:28.710
- Yeah, well, I don't give a fuck.
- But he hates fakes.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.269
Hey, Tomothy.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.629
Yo. Would you like a cup of tea
or coffee?

03:33.630 --> 03:35.629
Hmm, yeah. What are you having?

03:35.630 --> 03:39.549
Er. What am I having? Tea.
No, coffee.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.509
- No, tea.
- Shit or get off the pot, dude!

03:41.510 --> 03:43.789
Tea. Teas all round!

03:43.790 --> 03:46.269
OK. Howard hasn't even
touched his cheese.

03:46.270 --> 03:49.549
- Oh, I'll have it, I'm skint.
- That's it, I'm calling round
all the hospitals.

03:49.550 --> 03:52.429
He's not going to be dead because of
a lack of cheese consumption.

03:52.430 --> 03:55.869
I mean, if anything, he's probably thriving
on his incredibly low cholesterol.

03:55.870 --> 03:57.869
So, everything shipshape on
HMS Hartnell?

03:57.870 --> 03:59.749
Everyone up-to-date with their rent?

03:59.750 --> 04:02.309
Uh, basically, yeah.
I mean, it's hard to remember.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.789
It's not like I keep a big book
all about the rent.

04:04.790 --> 04:06.429
You don't have a rent book?

04:06.430 --> 04:10.430
No, I do. I just...
call it something different.

04:10.630 --> 04:13.669
It's a good job I'm looking
over the incoming direct debits.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.869
You can't be friends
to your tenants, bro.

04:15.870 --> 04:18.389
You're a land-LORD not a land-MATE.

04:18.390 --> 04:20.709
You need to pull an Uncle Royston,
get busy with

04:20.709 --> 04:23.389
the 12 bore, start randomly
shooting up the grain stores.

04:23.390 --> 04:24.989
Spread a little fear.

04:24.990 --> 04:27.549
Because whoever Violet Nordstrom is,
she is taking

04:27.550 --> 04:31.029
the piss like this is Nando's
and she has unlimited piss refills.

04:31.030 --> 04:33.669
Er, I better go! Laterz, haterz.

04:33.670 --> 04:37.670
Bro, don't be horrible to Vod,
be horrible to Kingsley.

04:37.750 --> 04:41.750
And who the fuck is Eskimo Joe?

04:43.630 --> 04:45.709
Oh, so when you eat it
in tiny pieces,

04:45.710 --> 04:48.189
it's the oh-so-fashionable sushi?

04:48.190 --> 04:51.149
But a whole raw fish,
that's unacceptable for some reason.

04:51.150 --> 04:53.909
Howard!? What the fuck?
Where have you been?

04:53.910 --> 04:55.029
We've been worried.

04:55.030 --> 04:57.269
I've been right here,
since the Christmas period.

04:57.270 --> 04:59.909
Thought I'd lessen the distractions
from revision. I've been

04:59.910 --> 05:03.589
getting up at midnight and going to
bed at 8am, in the cellar.

05:03.590 --> 05:06.789
And I am, copyright
of the McDonald's Corporation,

05:06.790 --> 05:09.869
"lovin' it".

05:09.870 --> 05:11.189
We have a cellar?

05:11.190 --> 05:12.749
Now you tell me.

05:12.750 --> 05:16.629
And all this time I've been storing
my wine in a rack like some...

05:16.630 --> 05:20.630
accountant!

05:30.590 --> 05:34.589
Oh, God, you've gone full
serial killer.

05:34.590 --> 05:37.709
And there it is. My dream...

05:37.710 --> 05:39.589
my nightmare...

05:39.590 --> 05:42.309
my Killer. The Dominatrix.

05:42.310 --> 05:44.829
Is it...?

05:44.830 --> 05:47.309
Oh, it's just a revision timetable.

05:49.230 --> 05:50.869
Yes, my simian friend,

05:50.870 --> 05:54.870
in the same way that Napoleon
Bonaparte was a mere "soldier".

05:55.110 --> 05:57.989
Like the Ark of the Covenant is
simply a box. Yes, this is

05:57.990 --> 06:00.309
"just a revision timetable".

06:00.310 --> 06:04.310
Hmm. This structure defines my every
movement in 30 minute intervals

06:04.710 --> 06:07.069
between now
and my final examination.

06:07.070 --> 06:10.189
All I must do is submit to
its every demand,

06:10.190 --> 06:12.989
however unreasonable,

06:12.990 --> 06:16.029
and then
a first class degree will be mine.

06:16.030 --> 06:20.030
And my dream job as data architect
at Ordnance Survey.

06:20.510 --> 06:23.549
JP, tell you what, you need to
get on it, like Moleman here.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.629
- No offence.
- Some taken.
- Ten more weeks.

06:25.630 --> 06:28.229
Easter, then lectures pack up,
that's basically it.

06:28.230 --> 06:32.230
- The party's over.
- No! It's...

06:34.150 --> 06:38.069
11 weeks and some days.

06:38.070 --> 06:41.149
Fuck! The fun's running out!

06:41.150 --> 06:43.629
Howard. Why, today,
are you venturing upstairs?

06:43.630 --> 06:45.349
Well. Er, Vitamin D,

06:45.350 --> 06:49.350
fish oil, and today is the day that
Candice returns from her

06:49.670 --> 06:51.989
- Erasmus term in France!
- OK?

06:51.990 --> 06:54.509
And I will be decorating my room
with the remains of flowers

06:54.510 --> 06:56.909
gathered from behind
the local florist's!

06:56.910 --> 07:00.109
Nothing says love, according to the
Western romantic canon,

07:00.110 --> 07:04.110
like decaying plant matter.

07:09.990 --> 07:11.829
Hi, Rosa! Sorry I'm late.

07:11.830 --> 07:15.830
- What is this?
- Final year forum.

07:17.310 --> 07:19.189
Wow. A lot have come.

07:19.190 --> 07:21.309
Yes. There is a lot of anger.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.429
And they need to vent it on someone.

07:23.430 --> 07:25.069
Yeah, no, I get it.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.789
It's just...
do they have to vent it on me?

07:28.790 --> 07:31.029
No, I mean, they probably do.

07:31.030 --> 07:35.030
OK. Showtime!

07:39.910 --> 07:43.909
So! Third years. January. Hello.

07:43.910 --> 07:47.910
Er, for many of you, these
are your final months of education.

07:47.990 --> 07:51.990
You are at a crossroads.
You are confused. Anxious.

07:53.030 --> 07:57.030
Now is the time to look to me,
your president, to help you cope.

07:58.590 --> 08:02.590
For, like my fellow President
Mandela - God bless you, Madiba -

08:03.230 --> 08:07.230
- I have written a book!

08:08.710 --> 08:10.149
Think of it as your Bible.

08:10.150 --> 08:12.669
But it's better than the Bible
because it's got an index of

08:12.670 --> 08:16.629
sexual health clinics and registered
media recruitment agencies.

08:22.910 --> 08:25.389
Ogs! Can we have a word?

08:25.390 --> 08:26.869
I'm going to take a word with her.

08:26.870 --> 08:29.749
Can you push the whole day
back five, please?

08:29.750 --> 08:33.750
Yeah, so, look, er, thing is...
I'm getting heat on the rent.

08:33.830 --> 08:36.509
And finals coming up.
Bank's closed my account,

08:36.510 --> 08:40.510
so I'm going to need cash for
Red Bull, protein shakes

08:40.750 --> 08:42.909
and guys in Korea to knock out
my course work.

08:42.909 --> 08:45.709
I get it. You've come crawling
back to me for help?

08:45.710 --> 08:47.509
Well, not exactly crawling, but...

08:47.510 --> 08:50.509
Vod, I'm the President,
of course I can sort it out for you.

08:50.510 --> 08:53.429
Even if there isn't a job,
I'll just make one up. Rosa?

08:53.430 --> 08:57.109
Has a president ever had a sort of -
not really like a jester -

08:57.110 --> 08:59.229
but a sort of artist in residence?

08:59.230 --> 09:01.469
Like that area? Yeah?

09:01.470 --> 09:05.470
We can certainly look at it.

09:10.430 --> 09:13.829
Really? Well, that's one way
of looking at it.

09:13.830 --> 09:17.029
I suppose the other way...

09:17.030 --> 09:20.709
Miss Shawcross. Miss Nordstrom.

09:20.710 --> 09:23.069
So pleased you could join us
to share your, no doubt,

09:23.070 --> 09:25.109
ground-breaking
thoughts on The Waste Land.

09:25.110 --> 09:29.110
Jeremy was just saying
he thought it was a bit "short".

09:29.550 --> 09:32.669
Yeah, OK. Sorry to interrupt,
erm, but I just wondered

09:32.670 --> 09:34.229
if I could just jump in?

09:34.230 --> 09:36.469
Because I've actually got
a meeting with the Mayor,

09:36.470 --> 09:39.589
for a mayoral tree
planting at 11, with the Mayor.

09:39.590 --> 09:41.549
Will the Mayor be there?

09:41.550 --> 09:43.309
Yeah, he will, actually.

09:43.310 --> 09:47.310
Er, then lunch with the MP for
Didsbury before we open the new lab.

09:47.710 --> 09:50.709
So, if you don't mind, I'm just
going to dive in with a brain dump,

09:50.710 --> 09:54.109
and then just leave you guys to stay
and chat.

09:54.110 --> 09:56.069
Is that OK?

09:56.070 --> 10:00.070
OK. Anti-semitism!

10:01.670 --> 10:04.549
So, dude. How's the five-year plan?

10:04.550 --> 10:08.550
Here we are, full English with
game sausage and chips!

10:08.670 --> 10:10.229
The Nanny Pru special!

10:10.230 --> 10:14.230
Yeah, good. And I'm on course
for a rock star bonus.

10:14.910 --> 10:18.589
Fail. Nanny Pru would never let
the eggs touch the beans, dude.

10:19.790 --> 10:23.790
- So, what you got for me?
- Well, I've had some ideas.

10:23.950 --> 10:27.909
I've been Googling. And not just
since you arrived.

10:27.910 --> 10:31.910
I think I'd like to work with lions.
Maybe in a safari park.

10:32.350 --> 10:35.389
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Well, I mean,

10:35.390 --> 10:39.390
maybe just in an admin capacity,
but I like lions. That's solid.

10:39.470 --> 10:43.470
No-one works with lions,
don't be a wanker.

10:43.830 --> 10:47.830
Right, but I mean, some people do,
obviously.

10:48.350 --> 10:51.429
No, you're right. What about my art?

10:51.430 --> 10:55.149
Do you think there's maybe something
I could... You know?

10:55.150 --> 10:59.150
You can't make a living drawing
dicks. This isn't France.

10:59.590 --> 11:03.590
- It's time for the suit.
- The suit?
- Hmmm, yeah.

11:03.630 --> 11:07.630
- This is what you'll wear to go and
see Jonty Harrington.
- Jonty Bonty?
- Yeah.

11:08.030 --> 11:12.030
Jonty Bonty Harrington. Mind your Ps and Qs
and he'll slide you into a job at my firm.

11:12.910 --> 11:16.629
- So that's what I'm doing, is it?
- Sure. Daddy did it for me,

11:16.630 --> 11:20.469
and now I'm doing it for you
since... Daddy's not around.

11:20.470 --> 11:24.389
- Yeah, there's no need to cry.
- I'm not crying, mate.
Daddy's no biggie for me.
- Yeah, likewise.

11:24.390 --> 11:27.749
- I'm cool talking Dad.
It's easy peasy not to get cheesy.
- Well, good, mate,

11:27.750 --> 11:31.309
don't blub about it.
- I'm not going to blub,
are you going to blub?
- Fuck off.

11:31.310 --> 11:34.389
Hey, Vod, check out my suit.

11:34.390 --> 11:37.469
I was worried about my future, but
it turns out it's going to be fine.

11:37.470 --> 11:41.470
Oh, brilliant.
I was really worried about you.

11:42.590 --> 11:45.269
How's that, er, pharmacology course
going for you, mate?

11:45.270 --> 11:48.829
Do you realise that tonight is the
last chance we'll have to watch the

11:48.830 --> 11:52.830
first in a new series of New Tricks
all together, as a house, ever?

11:54.550 --> 11:57.709
Yeah, er, out of interest,
can you make Mandy or acid yet?

11:57.710 --> 12:00.429
Did we miss the last Pancake Day?

12:00.430 --> 12:02.709
Look, the thing is,
I am going to need some money.

12:02.710 --> 12:06.710
It moves. Yeah, Pancake Day,
you slippery fucker.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.789
So now I'm thinking,
"Vod, play to your strengths.

12:09.790 --> 12:12.669
"You know drugs,
you've got some great contacts.

12:12.670 --> 12:13.989
"All you need now is a source."

12:13.990 --> 12:17.269
- I am not going to be
your drugs mule.
- Not a mule!

12:17.270 --> 12:21.270
You would be a lovely, rosy-cheeked,
nutty little drugs milk maid.

12:22.150 --> 12:26.150
No. And also, what's with
the rosy fucking cheeks?!

12:28.990 --> 12:32.990
Hey, Howie, last first New Tricks
tonight? Feel free to bring Candice.

12:33.510 --> 12:37.189
OK. Oh, no, she texted saying not
to meet her off the coach after all.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.469
Oh. Er, everything all right?

12:39.470 --> 12:41.909
Yeah, just one of her texts.

12:41.910 --> 12:43.429
One of her texts?

12:43.430 --> 12:47.430
We text in a text window,
once a fortnight, rain or shine.

12:48.030 --> 12:50.149
Got to put the hours
in a relationship, Jose.

12:50.150 --> 12:54.150
Right?

12:54.910 --> 12:58.789
"I think we need to take a break,
I need to get my head together."

12:58.790 --> 13:00.829
Yeah.
She sent that before Christmas.

13:00.830 --> 13:03.549
And it was actually perfect
because I needed to get my head

13:03.550 --> 13:06.429
together, too,
so the timing was good.

13:06.430 --> 13:10.430
And, er, now... head together.

13:13.510 --> 13:17.309
Oh, God.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

13:17.310 --> 13:21.310
Maybe. Are you thinking about
Nanny Pru's three-legged Labrador?

13:28.630 --> 13:31.909
Check it out, guys!
I'm wearing my future,

13:31.910 --> 13:34.709
and it feels amazing!

13:34.710 --> 13:38.709
The future starts now.
Revision starts now.

13:38.710 --> 13:42.549
I'm going to get a 2:1 and I'm going
to slide into my amazing job

13:42.550 --> 13:45.869
that my amazing bro has
swung for me.

13:45.870 --> 13:48.189
I need to knuckle down. We all do.

13:48.190 --> 13:50.109
That is true.
Nose to the grindstone.

13:50.110 --> 13:51.669
Do some serious fucking study.

13:51.670 --> 13:54.309
I'm already four months in.

13:54.310 --> 13:58.310
We need to seriously,
seriously start knuckling down.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.269
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, yes, I like it.

14:02.270 --> 14:05.349
Yes. Good. Up at 6.30?

14:05.350 --> 14:07.109
Yeah. That's the spirit, mate.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.949
Tomothy, pleased to meet you.

14:08.950 --> 14:12.950
Oh, er, we already, erm... I'm...
I was the one with the American cereal.

14:13.030 --> 14:17.030
Here's my thinking, though.
Before we focus like laser beams,

14:17.430 --> 14:21.229
surely we should have one really,
really big one?

14:21.230 --> 14:23.749
A huge one. Massive.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.989
- There is a certain logic.
- So pathetic.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.989
We had that quite long argument
about the euro?

14:27.990 --> 14:31.990
We take all the temptations,
all the distractions, all the booze

14:32.590 --> 14:35.829
and the drugs, everything
from down the back of the sofa.

14:35.830 --> 14:39.830
All the intoxicants, the gluten
and the coffee and the weed

14:39.910 --> 14:43.069
and the speed and the Drambuie
and the voddy and the Nurofen

14:43.070 --> 14:44.509
and the garam masala...

14:44.510 --> 14:46.429
You get distracted by garam masala?

14:46.430 --> 14:48.389
Shut up, Howard! Sometimes I do.

14:48.390 --> 14:51.029
And then we turn it
all into a terrible milkshake.

14:51.030 --> 14:52.669
Or pancake. Nice!

14:52.670 --> 14:54.029
We consume it all tonight.

14:54.030 --> 14:58.030
And then we go out
and we go absolutely fucking mental.

14:58.510 --> 15:01.749
Then tomorrow, we knuckle down,
camomile tea it through until finals.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.829
Pancakes or punch? Shall
we go for pancakes or the punch?

15:04.830 --> 15:07.869
You need to decide.
Shit or get off the pot, new guy!

15:07.870 --> 15:10.069
Punch! Fine, it's the punch!

15:10.070 --> 15:12.949
I should be able to sort
the naughties. So, tell your mates.

15:12.950 --> 15:15.069
Yes, classic Hartnell night out!

15:15.070 --> 15:18.469
We give the bloody internal organs
some trouble that they won't forget!

15:18.470 --> 15:19.949
Fuck you, liver!

15:19.950 --> 15:23.429
Now's the time for you all to get
seriously laid. Third year.

15:23.430 --> 15:25.749
The social circle gets tighter
and tighter and then,

15:25.750 --> 15:29.629
when you leave uni, someone turns
the sex tap off for good.

15:29.630 --> 15:31.589
You've got six months to live.

15:31.590 --> 15:34.749
This is Adolf's bunker
the night before the Allies arrive.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.429
12 weeks, you're out of here.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.389
Tonight's the night.

15:39.390 --> 15:41.989
Everything I've wanted to do
in Manchester,

15:41.990 --> 15:45.389
I've just got to fucking do it.

15:45.390 --> 15:48.389
I want to release
a chicken in a tutorial.

15:48.390 --> 15:51.829
I want to eat the hottest curry
in Rusholme. I want to do

15:51.830 --> 15:55.830
a conga at a bunga bunga,
hire a limo and fill it with foam!

15:56.510 --> 15:59.189
I want to get a blow job
in a toilet.

15:59.190 --> 16:02.069
I want to go to Stockport
and Wythenshawe!

16:02.070 --> 16:06.070
I want to go to the Gay Village
and get fucked by a bunch
of really great guys!

16:11.030 --> 16:13.109
What?

16:13.110 --> 16:14.989
It's just that...

16:14.990 --> 16:17.795
It's what the Lonely Planet
said you should do.

16:25.690 --> 16:26.809
So, how's life, bro?

16:26.810 --> 16:28.649
Great, mate. It's fucking great.

16:28.650 --> 16:30.409
The little guy's not
sleeping too well,

16:30.410 --> 16:33.769
so, er, it's good to get away,
you know?

16:33.770 --> 16:37.770
Right, and this is definitely
the hottest one you have?

16:39.090 --> 16:41.049
Ah, God!

16:41.050 --> 16:42.969
That is ridiculous.

16:42.970 --> 16:45.369
I can't eat that,
it's too fucking hot.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.609
Oh, my God. I mean,
that is an unrealistic curry.

16:47.610 --> 16:50.089
I mean, you've at least got to
give me something I can eat.

16:50.090 --> 16:51.609
This is meant to be my dinner!

16:51.610 --> 16:54.369
Yeah, I'm pulling some big ones so,
it's usually only weekends

16:54.370 --> 16:56.009
when I see the little guy.

16:56.010 --> 16:58.169
You know, out at five, back at nine.

16:58.170 --> 16:59.809
You mean, nine to five?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.169
No, man. Five to nine.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.888
Right. Well, I mean, how does
that work?

17:04.890 --> 17:07.969
When do you, you know,
have a nice time?

17:07.970 --> 17:11.329
Er, I get a coffee on the way in.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.729
Big lunches?

17:13.730 --> 17:16.969
OK, look, I'm sorry, mate,
are you taking the piss?

17:16.970 --> 17:19.368
Is everyone having a big
laugh at whitey, back there?

17:19.369 --> 17:21.969
I mean, that's basically
a fucking korma.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.969
It's lovely.
I'm not an eight-year-old girl!

17:23.970 --> 17:26.368
Come on, give me something with some
balls on.

17:26.369 --> 17:28.249
Lunch in the saddle, mate.
Desk jockey.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.569
Right. And then what?
Cuddle up at night?

17:30.570 --> 17:33.649
No, Jen's usually wiped out.
So I, er, microwave something.

17:33.650 --> 17:35.489
Fall asleep in front of Newsnight.

17:35.490 --> 17:37.649
Wank in the shower,
if I can manage it.

17:37.650 --> 17:40.369
You know, do the e-mails every 30
minutes, that's the secret.

17:40.370 --> 17:43.049
Ping them back, keep pushing
them back or they'll bury you.

17:43.050 --> 17:46.009
It's just "yes, no, OK." "Thank
you, thank you, schedule it, Kelly."

17:46.010 --> 17:48.089
Just keep moving.

17:48.090 --> 17:50.449
Oh, fuck.

17:50.450 --> 17:52.049
But it's interesting, right?

17:52.050 --> 17:53.489
Well, what I do is boring.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.689
But if I do anything wrong,
I might get fired.

17:55.690 --> 17:59.690
So, that kind of keeps it
interesting, you know?

17:59.730 --> 18:03.730
Wow.

18:04.530 --> 18:08.530
Now, you see, this,
this, my friend, is perfect.

18:09.010 --> 18:12.129
It's painful,
incredibly unpleasant to eat.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.489
I'm certainly going to know
about it in the morning.

18:14.490 --> 18:18.490
But I can just about get it down.

18:18.650 --> 18:22.650
Eugh, vile.

18:32.490 --> 18:34.369
I have the product.

18:34.370 --> 18:38.169
Yes.

18:38.170 --> 18:41.729
Well, come on, hand over the goods!

18:41.730 --> 18:44.569
OK. Are the rest like that?

18:44.570 --> 18:46.169
That IS the pill.

18:46.170 --> 18:49.329
How do you mean, that is THE pill?

18:49.330 --> 18:52.249
You wanted your apples tonight,
I only had time to make one apple.

18:52.250 --> 18:56.250
This is a very new area of
cider production...

18:57.770 --> 18:58.889
(..for me.)

18:58.890 --> 19:02.890
150 quid for one pill?!

19:03.050 --> 19:04.249
What, what does it do,

19:04.250 --> 19:07.769
grow a magic beanstalk back to the
fucking Hacienda 1990?

19:07.770 --> 19:09.289
There will be more, Vod.

19:09.290 --> 19:12.729
I'm hardly even a drug
pusher with one.

19:12.730 --> 19:14.209
You can't push just once?

19:14.210 --> 19:16.009
That's a not a push, it's a poke.

19:16.010 --> 19:20.010
I'm a drug poker.

19:20.130 --> 19:21.449
Pills?

19:21.450 --> 19:25.450
Oi, psst, hey, hey, pills?
Pills?

19:27.330 --> 19:29.609
We could have gone to that bar that
I told you about

19:29.610 --> 19:30.889
that Aguero goes to,

19:30.890 --> 19:33.009
with the ice sculptures and the
frozen mojitos.

19:33.010 --> 19:34.609
I went. It's shit.

19:34.610 --> 19:37.249
James Milner was there,
having a diet Coke.

19:37.250 --> 19:41.250
Whereas, here, pissed student totty!

19:41.650 --> 19:45.650
To look at!

19:49.810 --> 19:51.409
Oh, very mature!

19:51.410 --> 19:55.410
Oh, hottest curry in Manchester,
tick. Champagne spray, tick.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.969
Right, now all
I need is a blow-job in the toilet.

19:58.970 --> 20:00.529
Any interest?

20:00.530 --> 20:02.009
Anyone?

20:02.010 --> 20:05.769
Kingsley has soft pillowy lips?

20:05.770 --> 20:07.369
Pills?

20:07.370 --> 20:11.370
Pills?

20:11.690 --> 20:12.929
Come on, Kingsley!

20:12.930 --> 20:14.249
♪ A bunga, bunga, bunga!

20:14.250 --> 20:16.489
♪ A bunga, bunga, bunga... ♪

20:16.490 --> 20:19.089
What an asshole.

20:19.090 --> 20:21.329
Yeah, he's actually
one of my closest friends, so,

20:21.330 --> 20:23.649
I can confirm you are totally
correct.

20:23.650 --> 20:27.650
"Bunga, bunga." For me, these
words are politically very loaded.

20:28.530 --> 20:30.249
Fucking students.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.969
Yeah, fucking students.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.249
And you're here because...?

20:34.250 --> 20:36.289
I work upstairs.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.449
I like watching the wheels go round.

20:38.450 --> 20:42.450
I like watching the holding pen
at the slaughterhouse.

20:43.330 --> 20:46.049
So I'm trying to fit in everything
I haven't done in Manchester,

20:46.050 --> 20:47.569
before 6.30 tomorrow.

20:47.570 --> 20:48.849
So much to do.

20:48.850 --> 20:52.609
I mean, I've never even listened
to a Smiths song!

20:55.890 --> 20:58.729
Oh? Is this The Smiths?

20:58.730 --> 21:02.730
In that case, I have listened to
a Smiths song.

21:04.330 --> 21:07.569
Er, we didn't meet.
I'm, er, JP's brother.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.049
Tomothy.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.289
Oh? Oregon.

21:11.290 --> 21:12.689
President of the union.

21:12.690 --> 21:14.049
- Right?
- For my sins.

21:14.050 --> 21:16.729
Union president. Wow.

21:16.730 --> 21:18.689
You, er, you pushing through a lot
of shit?

21:18.690 --> 21:21.009
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It gets pretty pushy.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.249
What's your biggest achievement,
would you say?

21:23.250 --> 21:26.929
Well, you know, I mean,
implementation is, is complex.

21:26.930 --> 21:30.569
But in terms of structural
reorganisation fund reallocation?

21:30.570 --> 21:32.929
Uh-huh. Sure.

21:32.930 --> 21:34.129
Well.

21:34.130 --> 21:38.130
You know, it's difficult to change
things... because... of reasons.

21:39.930 --> 21:42.209
For example, I tried to do a
free day at the gym,

21:42.210 --> 21:43.969
to encourage first years to...

21:43.970 --> 21:47.129
you know? But Rosa said that
that's...

21:47.130 --> 21:50.209
So, so in the end, we just
sort of put the prices up a bit.

21:50.210 --> 21:53.049
Which is similar, yeah.

21:53.050 --> 21:55.649
OK. I get it.
You do a lot of this?

21:55.650 --> 21:58.969
- Yeah, I mean, I open the odd faculty.
- Yeah.
- Sure.

21:58.970 --> 22:02.609
They roll you out, roll you
back in again. You sound plausible.

22:02.610 --> 22:03.929
Look good.

22:03.930 --> 22:05.129
You're an "RC".

22:05.130 --> 22:06.209
A ribbon cutter.

22:06.210 --> 22:07.529
A fruit fly.

22:07.530 --> 22:09.129
A Teflon wombat.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.729
A flak-catching shit sieve.

22:11.730 --> 22:15.089
Well, no, because that's
a lot of horrible words, hold on,

22:15.090 --> 22:17.729
because, actually, I've just
launched a study guide

22:17.730 --> 22:20.529
for final year students which...

22:20.530 --> 22:24.369
Um, Rosa?

22:24.370 --> 22:27.329
Why isn't the Short Walk To Freedom
in the display bins

22:27.330 --> 22:28.489
as per my directive?

22:28.490 --> 22:30.689
People need my book, my
little red book.

22:30.690 --> 22:32.089
Yeah, about that name...

22:32.090 --> 22:34.609
Oh, yes, update on that.

22:34.610 --> 22:37.849
The finance committee couldn't agree
on a full print run in the end.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.249
I'm sorry.

22:39.250 --> 22:42.569
I can explain to you with your big
calculator on Monday.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.369
Well, how many copies did
they print?

22:44.370 --> 22:45.409
Ten.

22:45.410 --> 22:47.489
Just 10,000?

22:47.490 --> 22:51.490
No, just ten.

23:09.130 --> 23:11.649
Pill?

23:11.650 --> 23:13.569
Candice. She texted.

23:13.570 --> 23:15.809
- Oh, good. Brilliant.
- Yeah. She wants a "big talk".

23:15.810 --> 23:16.889
Uh-huh?

23:16.890 --> 23:20.049
It'll be good cos she thinks
I deserve someone better.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.129
Right?

23:21.130 --> 23:23.969
She'll be relieved when I'm like,
"Nah, you're fine."

23:23.970 --> 23:27.970
Howard.
Erm, "It's not you, it's me."

23:28.730 --> 23:30.209
Erm, well, that's no biggie.

23:30.210 --> 23:32.329
I assured her that
I was fine with her.

23:32.330 --> 23:36.330
And as it's not me, as she states,
but her, then no problem!

23:37.570 --> 23:41.409
OK, Howard, erm, I'm so sorry.

23:41.410 --> 23:42.809
But I have to tell you,

23:42.810 --> 23:46.810
as a human being from Planet Earth,
that your relationship is over.

23:50.010 --> 23:53.729
Oh, yes, patronise me,
Little Miss Relationships!

23:53.730 --> 23:55.489
Well, I can settle this...

23:55.490 --> 23:58.329
Oh, no, Howard, don't, don't...

23:58.330 --> 23:59.769
Candice!

23:59.770 --> 24:01.649
Oh, yes, er, it's great to get you!

24:01.650 --> 24:04.089
Erm. I'm just triple-checking.

24:04.090 --> 24:08.090
You are still my girlfriend,
aren't you?

24:08.730 --> 24:12.730
Well, I don't see how it can
be that complicated...

24:13.610 --> 24:16.409
I'm a ribbon cutter.
She's thwarting me.

24:16.410 --> 24:19.809
I was going to roll those fatties
onto the treadmill for free.

24:19.810 --> 24:21.529
Look, you're president.

24:21.530 --> 24:23.529
Would Putin let someone do this
to him?

24:23.530 --> 24:25.969
Or would he poison them
and then shoot them?

24:25.970 --> 24:28.009
And then take his shirt off and piss
on them?

24:28.010 --> 24:30.769
- I can't believe he left you for your
best friend?
- Oh, yeah,

24:30.770 --> 24:33.449
he used to wash his face
with the garden hose before

24:33.450 --> 24:36.129
he came home every night,
so I couldn't smell her perfume.

24:36.130 --> 24:38.769
Oh, that's horrible.

24:38.770 --> 24:42.609
Oh, it's just so complicated
And so grown up.

24:42.610 --> 24:46.409
Listen, if you want to get
away from these bloody students,

24:46.410 --> 24:48.209
we could go back to my house?

24:48.210 --> 24:49.849
Your student house?

24:49.850 --> 24:51.489
Yeah, but my room is a haven.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.689
I have a shelf of books
I don't even need to read

24:53.690 --> 24:55.009
but I do anyway, just for fun.

24:55.010 --> 24:57.609
- Hello, Rosa. It's the ribbon cutter here.
- Hello?

24:57.610 --> 25:00.329
I've worked out what's going on
and I'm giving you your notice.

25:00.330 --> 25:01.529
I'm sorry?

25:01.530 --> 25:05.530
Think of your job as a ribbon.
I'm cutting it. You're fired.

25:06.330 --> 25:10.330
You just made a big mistake.
You can't do that!

25:11.890 --> 25:13.089
Great.

25:13.090 --> 25:15.849
The first grown-up, complicated,
fascinating woman who's

25:15.850 --> 25:18.489
agreed to come back to my room all
year and you give her the sack.

25:18.490 --> 25:22.490
I'm sure Alan Sugar and my mother
would be very pleased.

25:33.610 --> 25:37.249
Pill.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.049
I'm sorry.

25:40.050 --> 25:42.489
Hey, mate! Top night in here.

25:42.490 --> 25:44.569
Do you fancy an Irish cocoa?

25:44.570 --> 25:46.449
Nanny Pru stylee?

25:46.450 --> 25:49.729
- Oh?
- Oh, come on, man,
let's have a mental early one.

25:49.730 --> 25:52.009
Hit the duvet hard like Eminem
and Dre do,

25:52.010 --> 25:54.289
probably, when they haven't seen
each other for ages

25:54.290 --> 25:55.569
and want to have a catch-up.

25:55.570 --> 25:58.089
Yeah, fuck that.
I'm having a very good time!

25:58.090 --> 26:01.009
But you don't want to do anything
that you might regret?

26:01.010 --> 26:04.209
Listen, mate, what happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas!

26:04.210 --> 26:07.689
Sorry, I don't understand.
What happened in Vegas?

26:07.690 --> 26:09.929
I slept with a prostitute.

26:09.930 --> 26:11.729
All right, one percenters?

26:11.730 --> 26:14.769
Who wants to cough
up for a party pill?

26:14.770 --> 26:16.209
How much?

26:16.210 --> 26:17.449
Er...

26:17.450 --> 26:19.169
200?

26:19.170 --> 26:20.529
That must be a very good pill.

26:20.530 --> 26:23.209
It is like Disneyland,
Christmas morning,

26:23.210 --> 26:27.210
your 18th and your hardest cum all
got remixed by David Guetta.

26:29.410 --> 26:33.410
Oh, plus, it's got a windmill on it.

26:36.530 --> 26:40.530
That's one half of one of your four
months of back rent dealt with.

26:41.450 --> 26:43.809
- You are NOT allowed to
have sex with Tomothy.
- Why not?

26:43.810 --> 26:46.609
Because of a little something called
the institution of marriage

26:46.610 --> 26:50.569
and a little organisation called
the Church of fucking England.

26:50.570 --> 26:53.809
Look, I'll do whatever I want and
Tomothy should do whatever he wants.

26:53.810 --> 26:57.729
That is a horrible philosophy.

26:57.730 --> 27:01.730
Oi! Quick quiz.
What fucks like a tiger and winks?

27:05.610 --> 27:07.329
Vod, I need to speak with you.

27:07.330 --> 27:10.009
All right, Walter White.

27:10.010 --> 27:13.929
I've got a very little, tiny worry
about some of the quantities I used.

27:13.930 --> 27:16.809
- The pill. It's probably fine.
- Probably?

27:16.810 --> 27:20.449
Has it been ingested?

27:20.450 --> 27:21.489
Oh, God...

27:21.490 --> 27:25.129
Then you need to keep a very close
eye on the subject.

27:25.130 --> 27:27.929
Oh, my God, fucking hell, Sabine.
Should we just...?

27:27.930 --> 27:29.689
I don't think you need to worry.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.889
Just monitor his temperature
and vital signs very closely

27:32.890 --> 27:35.774
and you can relax, have a great
night out!

27:44.450 --> 27:47.349
You are a fucking talented
administrator.

27:47.350 --> 27:49.629
You know, I can see that just by
looking at you.

27:49.630 --> 27:51.749
Yeah. I think I am, actually.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.069
I have tiny Post-it notes...

27:54.070 --> 27:57.109
Cones are legendary.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.989
I mean, students and cones.

27:59.990 --> 28:03.069
But what do
I actually do with the cone?

28:03.070 --> 28:07.070
I mean, it's funny, right?

28:07.150 --> 28:08.909
But surely there's more to it?

28:08.910 --> 28:12.189
OK, motherfuckers. Death pancakes!

28:12.190 --> 28:13.829
General announcement.

28:13.830 --> 28:16.549
My relationship, as prophesied
by the doom-monger Josie,

28:16.550 --> 28:18.109
is indeed over.

28:18.110 --> 28:21.829
I will not be accepting any
consolation or human sympathy,

28:21.830 --> 28:23.909
many thanks for your interest.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.709
Howard!

28:25.710 --> 28:28.629
Are you OK?

28:28.630 --> 28:30.909
I've been such a fool.

28:30.910 --> 28:34.549
Yeah, it's confusing because you're
normally so pessimistic

28:34.550 --> 28:35.949
and doubting and...

28:35.950 --> 28:37.949
- Negative and sceptical?
- Exactly.

28:37.950 --> 28:41.189
So, how did you miss the subtext?

28:41.190 --> 28:45.190
Well, I guess, because...

28:46.950 --> 28:48.989
What?

28:48.990 --> 28:51.349
She said she loved me.

28:51.350 --> 28:53.109
Oh!

28:53.110 --> 28:55.629
She said she'd always love me.

28:55.630 --> 28:57.829
And I didn't know,
I had not been informed

28:57.830 --> 29:01.749
that when somebody says that,
they don't necessarily mean it.

29:01.750 --> 29:05.750
Oh, Howie.

29:10.350 --> 29:13.629
It's kind of hard to relax with all
of this heartbreak and cone-play

29:13.630 --> 29:17.469
and my archenemy, who I just fired,
hanging out in my kitchen.

29:17.470 --> 29:21.470
Seven years. I've been in this job
seven years

29:22.270 --> 29:24.709
and then that bitch tries to get
rid of me like that.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.309
My contract is crystal clear.

29:27.310 --> 29:30.949
If she wants a fight,
my ex is an employment lawyer.

29:30.950 --> 29:33.589
Oh, my God. What a mess.

29:33.590 --> 29:35.229
I am going to fuck her.

29:35.230 --> 29:38.669
And when I fuck, I fuck hard.

29:38.670 --> 29:40.309
Promises, promises!

29:40.310 --> 29:42.109
How's it going for you, mate?

29:42.110 --> 29:44.589
Crunchy, or have you got the
butterflies?

29:44.590 --> 29:46.469
Temperature feeling nice? Yeah?

29:46.470 --> 29:50.470
Fucking heartbeat
regular as Big Ben, yeah?

29:50.630 --> 29:52.189
Yeah, I tell you what,

29:52.190 --> 29:56.069
for a drug dealer, your aftercare
is off the scale.

29:56.070 --> 29:58.029
Oh, nice!

29:58.030 --> 30:01.629
I tell you what can be wild
about now, is a nice glass of tepid

30:01.630 --> 30:05.429
water and a lie down where we can
all see you.

30:05.430 --> 30:09.430
OK, let's crank up this party
with dodgy tequila.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.469
So, er...

30:13.470 --> 30:15.589
is this going to be your first lay
since...?

30:15.590 --> 30:18.709
She's on the rebound harder
than a squash ball,

30:18.710 --> 30:21.189
and she's looking for love in all
the wrong places!

30:21.190 --> 30:24.509
I don't know if it's a sex thing or
a power thing or what

30:24.510 --> 30:26.549
kind of thing I'm into.

30:26.550 --> 30:27.949
It's so fucked up!

30:27.950 --> 30:31.950
I've left a message with
Katrina in human resources.

30:32.350 --> 30:36.350
She's a good friend. An old friend.

30:37.910 --> 30:41.509
I think I might head to bed.
Get some room.

30:41.510 --> 30:45.510
Night, everyone.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.709
Psst!

30:50.710 --> 30:54.149
About Tomothy.
Maybe keep it vanilla?

30:54.150 --> 30:57.589
I mean, I know you're not exactly
a mega-ho in the sack but...

30:57.590 --> 31:00.429
Erm, I'm sorry, Vod, what?

31:00.430 --> 31:04.430
I am extremely, hugely,
raunchy and why are you even...?

31:05.990 --> 31:08.069
He's older, yeah?

31:08.070 --> 31:12.070
So, you know, keep his pulse low,
temperature low, heart rate low.

31:13.910 --> 31:16.949
Listen, I just want to let my hair
down and shag someone who

31:16.950 --> 31:19.109
I won't awkwardly
bump into in the arts faculty.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.949
So just leave me alone and let me
make one of those really fun

31:21.950 --> 31:25.950
mistakes that I rarely have the
time or energy to manage.

31:32.230 --> 31:34.509
Howard? You're killing the vibe!

31:34.510 --> 31:38.429
Maybe you could hoover
up your dreams in the morning?

31:38.430 --> 31:41.389
Or put your dick in the vacuum and
I'll squirt tequila in your mouth?

31:41.390 --> 31:42.829
No thanks, Josie.

31:42.830 --> 31:44.949
I'm trying to have a party!

31:44.950 --> 31:48.950
Yeah, about time I hit the
hay myself.

31:49.510 --> 31:51.229
You can sleep in my room.

31:51.230 --> 31:53.949
Er, yeah, I think I might just sling
a sleepy into the sparey.

31:53.950 --> 31:56.549
I'd prefer it if you slept with me.

31:56.550 --> 31:58.789
I get very lonely at night.

31:58.790 --> 32:00.869
- And scared.
- What?

32:00.870 --> 32:02.389
It's Howard.

32:02.390 --> 32:04.229
We all lock ourselves in,
every night.

32:04.230 --> 32:05.589
It's just sensible.

32:05.590 --> 32:09.590
I mean, he's not done
anything... yet.

32:09.790 --> 32:11.589
Once he did.

32:11.590 --> 32:14.869
- Yeah, do you really
lock yourselves in?
- No.

32:14.870 --> 32:17.629
Well, she doesn't, she's Welsh.
She's up for a rumble, 24/7.

32:17.630 --> 32:20.749
Fuck you, Made In Chelsea.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.469
Listen...

32:22.470 --> 32:25.909
bro, how does sleeping with Oregon
fit into your five-year plan, mate?

32:25.910 --> 32:27.669
I'm just having some fun, mate.

32:27.670 --> 32:29.309
And it's none of your business.

32:29.310 --> 32:31.949
Well, as a matter of fact, mate,
yes, it is.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.349
Because you've got a wife at home.
And Jen is lovely.

32:35.350 --> 32:37.429
She bought me that book, Coast,
for Christmas.

32:37.430 --> 32:38.869
The one about the coast.

32:38.870 --> 32:40.989
And I like it so much that
I won't even let anyone do

32:40.990 --> 32:43.669
a line off it, even though quite
a lot of the time it is the only

32:43.670 --> 32:44.789
book that I have around.

32:44.790 --> 32:47.429
So, please don't break her heart.

32:47.430 --> 32:50.029
JP, I'm chained to a fucking
desk 80 hours a week.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.669
I'm chained to my wife the other 80.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.989
So, let's just keep
this on the down-low, yeah?

32:53.990 --> 32:55.909
I'm not going to do anything anyway.

32:55.910 --> 32:59.910
It's just a bit of flirty-shirty.

33:00.350 --> 33:04.350
Worst... party... ever.

33:12.110 --> 33:13.709
Wow!

33:13.710 --> 33:16.549
You are under a fucking
mountain of debt.

33:16.550 --> 33:20.550
This is three credit cards on top
of your tuition and loans.

33:20.710 --> 33:23.069
Why are the RAF after you?

33:23.070 --> 33:25.669
That's bad, they have drones.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.909
Oh!

33:27.910 --> 33:29.229
Where'd you get those?

33:29.230 --> 33:31.629
These? These were making a lump
under your mattress.

33:31.630 --> 33:34.709
This is like 70 grand...

33:34.710 --> 33:37.469
Shut up. Anyway, I got a plan.

33:37.470 --> 33:39.429
Yeah? What's the plan?

33:39.430 --> 33:41.709
Die before I hit 27.

33:41.710 --> 33:44.349
What's the latest?

33:44.350 --> 33:47.109
Not much. Paolo Nutini and chat.

33:47.110 --> 33:48.629
OK, good.

33:48.630 --> 33:50.469
Why are you even bothered?

33:50.470 --> 33:51.509
I'm not.

33:51.510 --> 33:53.189
I just...

33:53.190 --> 33:56.349
believe that true love waits.

33:56.350 --> 33:57.749
Or something.

33:57.750 --> 33:59.349
Waits about half an hour.

33:59.350 --> 34:01.349
Why's he's being such a...?

34:01.350 --> 34:03.109
I'm going to tell him to fuck off.

34:03.110 --> 34:06.229
Lion taming and art.
Those are my passions.

34:06.230 --> 34:08.549
I mean, I'm not unrealistic,
I know that I might have to

34:08.550 --> 34:12.550
start off taming something a little
more manageable, like a puma.

34:13.150 --> 34:16.309
Uh-oh, it's gone quiet.
They've stopped chatting.

34:19.710 --> 34:22.549
Is he having a heart attack?

34:22.550 --> 34:26.550
Probably just... sex?

34:27.790 --> 34:29.469
All right!

34:29.469 --> 34:31.509
Just doing a round of waters!
Who's in?

34:31.510 --> 34:33.668
That's not flirty-shirty, that's
dirty-bertie!

34:33.670 --> 34:35.708
Hello? Do we not knock any more?

34:35.710 --> 34:37.589
Sorry, Ogs. I just need to check...

34:37.590 --> 34:38.989
Er, bit of a weird one.

34:38.989 --> 34:42.309
Can you open up? I just need to pop
this, it's for a project.

34:42.310 --> 34:43.949
What, like an English project?

34:43.949 --> 34:45.909
Come on, or it's going in the
back door.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.748
He's got a wife at home.
She's lovely. She makes soup.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.509
Can't I have a single night off?

34:50.510 --> 34:53.228
Bill Clinton had his saxophone,
he's my saxophone.

34:53.230 --> 34:54.748
Get out!

34:54.750 --> 34:58.750
Look, OK, the truth is,
I sold your saxophone a dodgy pill

34:59.270 --> 35:01.389
and I'm worried he's going to die.
- What?!
- What?

35:01.390 --> 35:02.429
It's probably fine.

35:02.430 --> 35:06.430
But, erm, the "lab" where they came
from just had a few... doubts.

35:06.590 --> 35:08.029
Well, what the hell's in it?

35:08.030 --> 35:10.269
I don't know. This and that.
Sabine knocked it up...

35:10.270 --> 35:11.429
Sabine?

35:11.430 --> 35:13.189
You gave my brother
a pill made by Sabine?

35:13.190 --> 35:14.549
She's a pharmacologist!

35:14.550 --> 35:17.389
She's a biscuit-licking European
oddball that hates us!

35:17.390 --> 35:19.509
Oh, God, and it had to happen in
the North!

35:19.510 --> 35:22.389
Oh, my God, what have you done?
If you have hurt this.

35:22.390 --> 35:24.189
You could knock
a percentile off the GDP.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.349
Just call Bupa.
I might need to be 'coptered south.

35:26.350 --> 35:28.829
Calm down, we don't want your blood
pressure to spike.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.509
This brain is gold!

35:30.510 --> 35:33.149
- If you've damaged even
a single cell of it...
- I will sue.

35:33.150 --> 35:35.709
- Look, should we get medical help?
- Shall we get Josie in here?

35:35.710 --> 35:38.309
Oh, yeah! Josie, the struck-off
trainee dentist?

35:39.510 --> 35:42.589
Well, who the hell is that?

35:42.590 --> 35:43.669
Well, I'll get it, shall I?

35:43.670 --> 35:46.149
Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to A & E, on the way

35:46.150 --> 35:48.629
I'll call the police, tell them
I got spiked by a drug dealer.

35:48.630 --> 35:50.189
You're going to prison.
You know why?

35:50.190 --> 35:52.389
Because you have fucked with the
wrong pineapple!

35:52.390 --> 35:55.069
- What the fuck?
- Come on, mate.
It was just an accident.

35:55.070 --> 35:58.469
- She thought the pill was safe.
- Bullshit.
- It did have a windmill.

35:58.470 --> 36:00.909
She's an a-hole.
All your housemates are a-holes.

36:00.910 --> 36:02.989
The pusher, the no-mark,
the Welsh alcoholic,

36:02.990 --> 36:04.829
fucking Stig of the Dump...

36:04.830 --> 36:08.830
I don't live in a dump.
I revise in a cellar.

36:11.710 --> 36:14.549
It would be more accurate to call me
"The Fritzl Of Revision."

36:14.550 --> 36:17.229
The truth is, Tomothy,
you shouldn't have taken the pill.

36:17.230 --> 36:18.989
And you shouldn't be
in Oregon's bed!

36:18.990 --> 36:22.069
I'm calling an ambulance
and the police.

36:22.070 --> 36:24.549
Put the phone down or
I will clonk you on the dome.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.029
Ow! Fuck!

36:26.030 --> 36:27.829
I said I would clonk you.

36:27.830 --> 36:30.789
Now, put the phone down to
avoid more clonks.

36:30.790 --> 36:34.389
Guys, could you, erm,
keep the noise down?

36:34.390 --> 36:36.149
Rosa and I are trying to relax.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.269
Piss off, Kingsley!

36:37.270 --> 36:39.389
Ah, now you remember my name.

36:39.390 --> 36:42.749
The guy who pulled a hot,
fully-grown Italian?

36:42.750 --> 36:45.429
We can all relax, it's fine.

36:45.430 --> 36:47.349
It's safe. I triple-checked.

36:47.350 --> 36:49.909
I was really concentrating
this time.

36:49.910 --> 36:52.549
I even turned off the radio.

36:52.550 --> 36:53.909
The pill's safe.

36:53.910 --> 36:55.829
How do you know for sure?

36:55.830 --> 36:59.469
I just took one a few hours ago.
I feel great.

36:59.470 --> 37:01.829
Here's the batch.

37:01.830 --> 37:04.229
I'm going to try to touch
a duck in the park.

37:04.230 --> 37:06.789
They look so soft. Hey.

37:06.790 --> 37:10.069
Goodnight.

37:10.070 --> 37:13.749
Finally, I'm out.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.349
I'm out the game.

37:15.350 --> 37:18.109
There is too much health and safety
in drug dealing these days.

37:18.110 --> 37:20.749
You're turning in.
9am at the tailor.

37:20.750 --> 37:22.509
Ooh, about that.

37:22.510 --> 37:25.269
I'm not sure I actually need
the suit.

37:25.270 --> 37:26.549
What?

37:26.550 --> 37:30.109
Well, I think I might prefer
to do a more interesting job.

37:30.110 --> 37:32.829
Not lions necessarily.

37:32.830 --> 37:34.149
Or cocks.

37:34.150 --> 37:36.989
Maybe something in media or books

37:36.990 --> 37:39.389
or the music industry.

37:39.390 --> 37:41.909
- Yeah.
- But I'm not sure I want to
be a fuck-off banker.

37:41.910 --> 37:43.909
Well, don't worry, mate.
You won't be.

37:43.910 --> 37:46.709
Cambridge, Imperial, Harvard,
they're full of physicists,

37:46.710 --> 37:49.149
geniuses who fuck off
the cancer-curing

37:49.150 --> 37:50.549
to work in derivatives.

37:50.550 --> 37:52.549
You wouldn't get a look-in.

37:52.550 --> 37:53.869
Oh.

37:53.870 --> 37:54.989
I see.

37:54.990 --> 37:57.549
Look, real world, JP,
you're a fucking good guy,

37:57.550 --> 37:59.189
you're a clinical moron.

37:59.190 --> 38:00.229
Stick with me,

38:00.230 --> 38:04.029
big bro will keep an eye on you,
make sure you don't shit the bed.

38:04.030 --> 38:05.389
What?

38:05.390 --> 38:07.469
Look, I'm being nice.

38:07.470 --> 38:09.029
I'm helping you out, bro.

38:09.030 --> 38:11.989
Right.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.149
Thank you.

38:13.150 --> 38:17.150
Yeah.
