23:16.670 --> 23:19.306
I don't typically bringpatients to my office.

23:27.314 --> 23:31.618
My first three years here,I kept a scrapbook...

36:15.248 --> 36:16.115
Is this you?

36:16.149 --> 36:16.983
Yup.

36:18.251 --> 36:19.352
Here we go.

36:28.361 --> 36:29.462
Nice ride!

36:29.495 --> 36:31.464
Dude, it's free.

36:38.237 --> 36:39.305
Okay.

36:39.338 --> 36:42.408
No, I've got this,I need to do it.

36:42.441 --> 36:43.542
Okay.

37:04.530 --> 37:11.270
[Engine Starts and squeals]

37:11.304 --> 37:14.373
[Loud squealing]

37:29.222 --> 37:31.590
[Elevator bell rings]

38:00.086 --> 38:02.655
[Big Sigh]

38:06.059 --> 38:10.129
[Sound of an  audience cheering]

39:03.749 --> 39:07.520
[Raining Sounds]

39:22.168 --> 39:24.337
I'm sorry aboutthe car Dad.

39:24.370 --> 39:27.140
You oughta  be sorry,

39:27.173 --> 39:30.509
that car raced  for two seasons.

39:30.543 --> 39:32.578
Two seasons withoutso much as a scratch,

39:32.611 --> 39:36.149
then you get in it andyou flip the thing over.

39:36.182 --> 39:38.384
That old Max Wedgemade 525 horsepower.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.786
We broke therecord at Indy.

39:40.819 --> 39:43.856
It was 11:21  at 121 mile/hour

39:43.889 --> 39:46.292
and we went onto win the event.

39:46.325 --> 39:49.362
But still it wasnothing like that day.

39:49.395 --> 39:53.399
Now that, was amoment to remember.

39:53.432 --> 39:55.701
We'd just taken homethe 1990 championship.

39:55.734 --> 39:57.903
We were the"unbeatable team"they used to call us.

39:57.936 --> 39:59.638
- Your Dad and I.

39:59.672 --> 40:00.539
Uncle Paul?

40:00.573 --> 40:01.740
Yeah!

40:01.774 --> 40:04.243
Uncle Paul, that was whatyou used to call me back then.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.644
Mind if I sit down?

40:05.678 --> 40:08.847
Oh Yeah sure, sure.

40:08.881 --> 40:10.916
That was the lastrace in the old cuda.

40:10.949 --> 40:12.718
He ran straight and hard,but the next season

40:12.751 --> 40:15.554
we got a new carrunning pro-stock.

40:15.588 --> 40:17.423
I remember.

40:17.456 --> 40:21.294
Yeah, but I'm sure you'rewondering why I'm here?

40:21.327 --> 40:22.695
The thing is, I've beentrying to get the courage

40:22.728 --> 40:25.164
to come see you ever sinceyou had the accident.

40:25.198 --> 40:27.733
I didn't have the strengthfor that and I'm sorry.

40:27.766 --> 40:29.568
You don't owe me anything.

40:29.602 --> 40:32.571
No, no I think I at leastowe you an explanation.

40:32.605 --> 40:33.439
For what?

40:33.472 --> 40:35.574
About the crash thattook your father.

40:35.608 --> 40:38.344
What's to explain, firstround of the qualifying.

40:38.377 --> 40:41.880
Car got out of shape, hecollided with the side wall.

40:41.914 --> 40:43.416
Right?

40:43.449 --> 40:46.185
Your father told me, thathe felt like the backend

40:46.219 --> 40:47.586
was shaking so much thatit was going to come out

40:47.620 --> 40:49.388
of the frontend.

40:49.422 --> 40:51.724
I tried every adjustmentthat I could think of, but...

40:51.757 --> 40:54.860
The floor length, rearshocks, everything.

40:54.893 --> 40:56.629
And I never quitefigured it out,

40:56.662 --> 41:00.633
but still I insisted thathe go on and make a full run,

41:00.666 --> 41:03.736
and keep his foot init and you know the rest.

41:03.769 --> 41:05.838
After that day I drankmyself into an oblivion.

41:05.871 --> 41:09.742
I lost everything I ever hadand I never forgave myself.

41:12.878 --> 41:18.917
The reason I'm here is becauseI need you to forgive me.

41:18.951 --> 41:20.319
Joseph I should'vebeen there for you,

41:20.353 --> 41:22.855
I wasn't and I amtruly sorry for that.

41:29.662 --> 41:31.564
So, you said that uh,

41:31.597 --> 41:35.868
the most horsepower you ever gotout of that Max Wedge was 525?

41:35.901 --> 41:38.271
And that wason a good day.

41:38.304 --> 41:40.539
We got her up to625 on the dyno.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.542
625?

41:43.576 --> 41:45.878
625!

41:48.013 --> 41:49.948
It looks like it'sclearing up a bit,

41:49.982 --> 41:51.817
would you like to goget some fresh air?

41:51.850 --> 41:53.352
That sounds good.

41:54.620 --> 41:55.521
625?

41:55.554 --> 41:56.889
625!

41:59.425 --> 42:00.593
Ha!

42:13.806 --> 42:17.042
Right over there is somethingyou don't see every day.

42:17.075 --> 42:20.513
1932 Cadillac V16.

42:20.546 --> 42:24.016
They stopped making thosebabies just before WWII.

42:24.049 --> 42:27.052
Of Course right here isthe Ford flathead V8,

42:27.085 --> 42:29.855
preferred power plant ofhot rodders everywhere.

42:29.888 --> 42:31.424
This place is incredible!

42:31.457 --> 42:32.658
Yeah, well I've got somethingelse I want to show you.

42:32.691 --> 42:35.294
Hang on...

42:35.328 --> 42:36.662
Pro stock engine.

42:38.997 --> 42:42.568
[sigh]Just like Dad ran.

42:42.601 --> 42:44.002
Hey!

42:44.036 --> 42:45.538
Take a look at this!

42:47.840 --> 42:48.941

42:50.843 --> 42:52.010
This isn't real...

42:52.044 --> 42:53.679
Dad's Barracuda!

42:53.712 --> 42:54.547
Yeap!

42:54.580 --> 42:57.350
I didn't have theheart to sell him.

42:58.551 --> 42:59.618
Amazing.

43:01.086 --> 43:02.321
ADRENALINE.

43:02.355 --> 43:03.589
Perfect namewouldn't you say?

43:03.622 --> 43:04.590
Oh yeah.

43:05.791 --> 43:08.394
Yeah he's tried and true,battle scarred, that's for sure.

43:08.427 --> 43:09.695
Hasn't been runin over 20 years,

43:09.728 --> 43:12.898
but I think witha few tweaks here andthere he'd be just fine.

43:12.931 --> 43:15.468
Wheelie bars,Lexan windows...

43:15.501 --> 43:16.635
That's a tubechassis right?

43:16.669 --> 43:18.437
Yes it is!

43:18.471 --> 43:19.538
See that button onthe steering wheel?

43:19.572 --> 43:20.673

43:20.706 --> 43:22.375
Tranny brake!

43:24.477 --> 43:26.845
What I would do tofeel a kick like that.

43:26.879 --> 43:29.982
Well I do just happen toknow a guy who knows a guy...

43:31.850 --> 43:33.552
I'm that guy.

43:51.804 --> 43:52.538
There you go.

43:53.706 --> 43:55.007
Ha ha ha.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.510
Figured next time Iseen you, You wouldbe in a wooden box.

43:57.543 --> 43:59.111
NO, I wouldn't do that to you,You would miss me too much.

43:59.144 --> 43:59.912
Is that right?

43:59.945 --> 44:01.514
That is right!

44:01.547 --> 44:02.948
So who is yourfriend here?

44:02.981 --> 44:05.451

44:05.484 --> 44:08.654
Ronnie's boy Joey.

44:08.687 --> 44:10.556
Joey?

44:10.589 --> 44:14.560
Shoot boy, you've seenbetter days I reckon.

44:14.593 --> 44:15.928
You've got to  forgive Bennie,

44:15.961 --> 44:17.530
He's not much for conversation,it kind of confuses him.

44:17.563 --> 44:19.865
Hey!

44:19.898 --> 44:24.603
All seriousness, yourDaddy was a great driver.

44:24.637 --> 44:27.005
I used to let himtest out here.

44:27.039 --> 44:27.973
Ha.

44:28.006 --> 44:29.442
Seen better days I guess!

44:29.475 --> 44:30.976
No, it looksabout the same.

44:31.009 --> 44:31.977
Ha.

44:32.010 --> 44:34.580
Now that'snostalgia boy.

44:34.613 --> 44:36.715
What's y'all doing allthe ways out here anyway?

44:36.749 --> 44:39.151
Came out here to teach thisyoung fellah how to drive again.

44:39.184 --> 44:39.952
What?

44:39.985 --> 44:41.153
What?

44:41.186 --> 44:42.555
You said you wanted tofeel the kick right,

44:42.588 --> 44:45.524
there's no betterplace to feel the kick thenright here on the track.

44:45.558 --> 44:47.426
I think you're missinga pretty important piece here.

44:47.460 --> 44:49.695
Look all I want to do isget you back into a car

44:49.728 --> 44:51.564
so you can get thefeel for it.

44:51.597 --> 44:53.432
I'm not talking about breakingany land speed records.

44:53.466 --> 44:55.568
But I do want you toadjust to something new.

44:55.601 --> 44:57.936
This is the best place, ifyou want to learn to drive.

44:57.970 --> 44:59.171
You don't haveto race again.

44:59.204 --> 45:01.039
But you do have tobe self-sufficient.

45:02.908 --> 45:04.943
You're out of your mind.

45:04.977 --> 45:07.913
That may be, do you havesomething I can put him in?

45:12.918 --> 45:15.721
Okay this is obviouslya whole different carthen you're used to.

45:15.754 --> 45:17.856
Tell me somethingI don't know.

45:17.890 --> 45:19.992
I want to start by workingon your coordination.

45:20.025 --> 45:21.627
Yeah, I got it!

45:23.896 --> 45:25.864
[Deep Breath]

45:25.898 --> 45:29.502
I'm thinking we'd go awhole lot faster if youactually start the car.

45:35.240 --> 45:37.109
Pull it up to theline, nice and easy.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.015
Oh he's lost hisdang mind for sure.

45:44.182 --> 45:45.718
I can't watch this.

45:45.751 --> 45:48.053
It's okay, don't worryabout that, back up.

45:55.528 --> 45:57.863
You've got this, justtry it again, let's go.

45:57.896 --> 45:58.797
No way!

45:58.831 --> 46:00.232
I can't do this.

46:00.265 --> 46:01.667
You don't havea choice.

46:01.700 --> 46:03.101
You're goingto do it.

46:03.135 --> 46:04.169
But we're goingto crash.

46:04.202 --> 46:05.604
If we crash,we crash!

46:05.638 --> 46:06.939
Now on three,you ready?

46:06.972 --> 46:08.140

46:18.717 --> 46:19.151
Okay.

46:21.820 --> 46:22.621

46:24.790 --> 46:25.223
Brake.

46:25.257 --> 46:26.859
I can't, I can't!

46:27.560 --> 46:28.827
Brake, Brake, Brake!

46:28.861 --> 46:30.028

46:34.700 --> 46:37.269
Now that's whatI'm talking about.

46:38.671 --> 46:39.838

46:42.107 --> 46:43.842
Alright, backit on up.

46:47.245 --> 46:48.781
Boy can't hardly walk.

46:54.119 --> 46:55.821
But he sure can drive.

46:59.925 --> 47:02.260
We must have ran thattrack like thirty times.

47:02.294 --> 47:04.262
Finally had to stopwhen the sun went down.

47:04.296 --> 47:05.864
That's incredible.

47:05.898 --> 47:06.665
I...

47:06.699 --> 47:08.233
I can't believe it,that's great.

47:08.266 --> 47:11.103
Yeah, it was great,just... great.

47:12.671 --> 47:15.273
Maybe one day you'll geta page in my scrapbook.

47:15.307 --> 47:16.942
Hmmmm.

47:16.975 --> 47:18.977
That was just for fun.

47:19.011 --> 47:20.779
Felt good though.

47:20.813 --> 47:23.649
Well you only have afew more visits with me,

47:23.682 --> 47:26.585

Got any plansthis weekend?

47:27.986 --> 47:29.788
Ah...

47:29.822 --> 47:30.956

47:33.892 --> 47:35.961
Yes, I'll go.

47:35.994 --> 47:37.663
Oh! Okay!

47:37.696 --> 47:39.798
[Chuckling]

47:54.046 --> 47:56.815
Haven't been to a racelike this in a long time.

47:56.849 --> 48:00.886
Everything is the same,the sounds, the smells,everything.

48:00.919 --> 48:02.020
Missed it?

48:02.054 --> 48:04.957
Never thought Iwould, until now.

48:04.990 --> 48:08.060
I grew up on the track, everyweekend this was my world.

48:08.093 --> 48:12.097
Nitro fumes, burnt rubber,popcorn with butter.

48:12.130 --> 48:14.132
Extra butterfor me, ha.

48:14.166 --> 48:15.834
Everybody lovesextra butter.

48:19.271 --> 48:20.873
I know the feeling.

48:20.906 --> 48:22.407
I had a placelike that,

48:22.440 --> 48:24.643
that my Mom took meto when growing up.

48:24.677 --> 48:25.844
Yeah.

48:25.878 --> 48:26.378
Yeah.

48:26.411 --> 48:28.080
What wasthat like?

48:29.447 --> 48:30.783
You don'twant to know.

48:30.816 --> 48:32.751
I do,tell me.

48:32.785 --> 48:34.019
Don't makefun of me.

48:34.052 --> 48:35.020
I won't.

48:36.955 --> 48:39.424
My Mom used to take meto this place called...

48:39.457 --> 48:41.860
"Mary's Gone Mad"

48:41.894 --> 48:46.765
Basically, this lady oneday just started painting,

48:46.799 --> 48:48.000
everythingin her house.

48:48.033 --> 48:49.802
Everything inside andoutside of her house,

48:49.835 --> 48:53.972
windows, toilets,kitchen sinks,

48:54.006 --> 48:55.974
you name it shewas painting it.

48:56.008 --> 48:57.943
People in the communitystarted finding out about it

48:57.976 --> 49:03.348
and just would show upto see what she was doing.

49:03.381 --> 49:06.351
She builtthis chapel,

49:06.384 --> 49:10.422
like a full on chapel out ofglass bottles in her front yard.

49:10.455 --> 49:11.724
I don'tbelieve it.

49:11.757 --> 49:13.125
Which I have tosay was incredible.

49:13.158 --> 49:15.427
I don'tbelieve it.

49:15.460 --> 49:17.830
Well, I will just findyou a picture then.

49:17.863 --> 49:18.697
I'm going toneed to see it.

49:18.731 --> 49:19.431
Cause it's amazing.

49:19.464 --> 49:20.766
Okay.

49:24.236 --> 49:25.704
So whatabout your Mom?

49:25.738 --> 49:28.106
I never knew her,she died when I was born.

49:28.140 --> 49:30.442
And my Dad raised me tillI was twelve years old

49:30.475 --> 49:32.244
and then he died.

49:32.277 --> 49:35.881
Then I was in and out of fostercare until I was eighteen.

49:35.914 --> 49:38.483
But luckily for me though Traceand I kept in contact and...

49:38.516 --> 49:41.219
As soon as I was out,it was like I had neverleft the neighborhood.

49:42.187 --> 49:43.789
He's a good friend.

49:43.822 --> 49:45.190
He seems like it.

49:49.461 --> 49:51.329
What are they doingto their tires?

49:51.363 --> 49:53.498
They're spinning the wheelsto get the tires hot and sticky,

It's the leastI could do.

01:05:53.791 --> 01:05:58.362
So one lastweek here.

01:05:58.395 --> 01:06:00.965
My number hasfinally come up.

01:06:00.998 --> 01:06:02.834
Mine too.

01:06:02.867 --> 01:06:04.268
I can'tbelieve it.

01:06:04.301 --> 01:06:09.473
In 3 weeks I'll have a chanceto compete at Dragstock X.

01:06:09.506 --> 01:06:11.108
Man whowould've thunk it.

01:06:11.142 --> 01:06:12.209
Not me!

01:06:12.243 --> 01:06:18.315
I mean this is like theworld series of drag racing.

01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:22.119
I'm proudof you Joseph.

01:06:22.153 --> 01:06:24.055
I appreciate that.

01:06:28.392 --> 01:06:29.360
Hey Eli,

01:06:29.393 --> 01:06:30.161
Uh hmm.

01:06:32.096 --> 01:06:34.298
Do you think dreamsmean anything?

01:06:34.331 --> 01:06:35.800
Why do you ask?

01:06:41.505 --> 01:06:46.878
I keep having thisdream, It's Dad...

01:06:46.911 --> 01:06:50.047
He's at theend of a track.

01:06:50.081 --> 01:06:53.284
And I'm running, I meanI can run my legs work.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:01.092
I see him and I'm going asfast as I can toward him.

01:07:01.125 --> 01:07:06.430
When I get to him, he'strying to tell me something.

01:07:06.463 --> 01:07:08.332
What is he tryingto tell you?

01:07:11.268 --> 01:07:13.104
I don't know...

01:07:13.137 --> 01:07:16.440
He says that I'm acar without an engine.

01:07:16.473 --> 01:07:18.042
Ha ha, I mean a carwithout an engine?

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:20.244
what's thatsupposed to mean?

01:07:20.277 --> 01:07:23.114
What do you mean,"What's that supposed to mean"?

01:07:23.147 --> 01:07:27.118
A car without an enginedoesn't get very far does it?

01:07:28.886 --> 01:07:35.192
Sounds like a manwithout a purpose.

01:07:35.226 --> 01:07:36.393
I have a purpose.

01:07:36.427 --> 01:07:38.395
Okay,and what is it?

01:07:40.832 --> 01:07:43.801
Glory.

01:07:43.835 --> 01:07:45.369
I mean isn'tthat enough.

01:07:45.402 --> 01:07:47.004
I mean...

01:07:47.038 --> 01:07:50.141
Even without being able towalk people look up to me now.

01:07:50.174 --> 01:07:53.477
They need to knowthat I can win.

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:56.547
I give people hope.

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.416
I'm someoneto believe in.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:01.385
Spoken like a true fool.

01:08:04.588 --> 01:08:07.458
Was glory worth losingyour ability to walk?

01:08:10.862 --> 01:08:12.129
I don't need this...

01:08:14.065 --> 01:08:16.934
When I first metyou, I told you,

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.970
you had to get right oryou were going to get left.

01:08:19.002 --> 01:08:20.037
Do you remember that?

01:08:21.037 --> 01:08:23.240
That meant you hadto get right in here.

01:08:23.274 --> 01:08:27.944
But mostly it means youhave to get right in here.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:31.015
I think your Daddy's tryingto tell you that without God...

01:08:31.048 --> 01:08:34.218
That thirst, that need forthat adrenaline pumping

01:08:34.251 --> 01:08:36.854
threw your veins oryou'll never be satisfied.

01:08:36.888 --> 01:08:39.924
You'll always be like ajunkie trying to get a fix.

01:08:39.957 --> 01:08:42.526
Why do youalways do this?

01:08:42.559 --> 01:08:45.095
God, really?

01:08:45.129 --> 01:08:47.564
I hate to break it to you,but I think God is a joke!

01:08:47.598 --> 01:08:48.432
Joseph.

01:08:48.465 --> 01:08:49.200
Listen.

01:08:49.233 --> 01:08:49.867

You listen tome this time!

01:08:51.035 --> 01:08:54.171
What kind of God takes a Dadaway from a 12 year old boy?

01:08:54.205 --> 01:08:56.006
You tell me that?Tell me that?

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.612
If there was a God,why would he let me crash,

01:09:01.645 --> 01:09:07.584
leave me crippled,let someone shoot you?

01:09:07.618 --> 01:09:10.287
Come on, God's notrunning the show here...

01:09:10.321 --> 01:09:13.090
We are!

01:09:13.124 --> 01:09:16.560
We control what happens,it's our choices.

01:09:16.593 --> 01:09:17.995
And you need tostart seeing that,

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.430
open your eyesand wake up.

01:09:19.462 --> 01:09:22.299
Take a lookaround you.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:26.002
God's a fairy tale.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:28.538
I earnedall this myself.

01:09:37.314 --> 01:09:38.950
Protect him Jesus.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.020
Protect him.

What happened toyou out there?

01:11:08.705 --> 01:11:10.374
I couldn't get offthe line fast enough.

01:11:10.407 --> 01:11:12.276

Did you check the lane?

01:11:15.712 --> 01:11:16.547
What kind of aquestion is that?

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:17.648
Did I check the lane?

01:11:17.681 --> 01:11:19.016
The right lanewasn't right,

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:20.551
I didn't have anytraction out the hole.

01:11:20.584 --> 01:11:23.220
If the right lane wasn'tright? a lot of people wereracing in the right lane.

01:11:23.254 --> 01:11:25.289
Nobody had anyproblem except you.

01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:28.492
Is that what you told myDad before he ran that day?

01:11:28.525 --> 01:11:29.560
What's this really about?

01:11:29.593 --> 01:11:31.195

01:11:43.274 --> 01:11:45.542
Huh.

01:11:45.576 --> 01:11:48.179
I know it, Trace knows it,everybody who knows you,

01:11:48.212 --> 01:11:50.247
knows it's betweenyou and Jason Skynard.

01:11:50.281 --> 01:11:52.083
Even your Father wouldtell you that if he were here.

01:11:52.116 --> 01:11:55.819
Well, he's not, you madesure of that didn't you?

01:11:55.852 --> 01:11:59.690

01:14:47.924 --> 01:14:48.759
Hey buddy.

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:49.793

It's going to be okay.

01:15:19.423 --> 01:15:20.891
He would'vereally loved this.

01:15:26.497 --> 01:15:29.300
I wish I would've had justone more chance to say...

01:15:31.635 --> 01:15:32.703
I know.

01:15:34.938 --> 01:15:36.440
I just don'tunderstand.

01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:40.911
I don't think weever really do.

01:15:44.815 --> 01:15:46.617
I mean, why?

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:49.320
Why doesthis have to happen,to Elli, my Dad?

01:15:51.355 --> 01:15:53.690
I should be theone dead not them.

01:15:53.724 --> 01:15:54.725
But you're not.

01:15:57.361 --> 01:16:00.063
You're probably just goingto say that's a miracle.

01:16:00.096 --> 01:16:03.367
I know this is going tosound crazy, but I...

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.838
I think it's muchmore than that.

01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:09.740
There was a timeI had my doubts,

01:16:09.773 --> 01:16:11.975
but I don't anymore.

01:16:12.008 --> 01:16:13.710
Why is that?

01:16:15.646 --> 01:16:19.783
I think we're all herefor a purpose and...

01:16:19.816 --> 01:16:21.518
Eli served his.

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.357
He spent most of hislife in a hospital bed.

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:28.459
You're missingthe point.

01:16:28.492 --> 01:16:32.062
It's not about the time hespent in a hospital bed.

01:16:32.095 --> 01:16:34.531
It's about what hedid with that time.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:40.337
I saw Eli make people laughwhen they were crying.

01:16:40.371 --> 01:16:43.740
He changed them,He changed me!

01:16:43.774 --> 01:16:46.109
He changed you.

01:16:46.142 --> 01:16:51.415
His love was realand powerful...

01:16:51.448 --> 01:16:54.685
and greaterthan all of us.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.458
Eli always said thatlove comes from God.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.929
Do you thinkthat's true?

01:17:05.962 --> 01:17:10.000
I do, It's a kind oflove that never gives up.

01:17:12.803 --> 01:17:17.974
It's the kind of love thatEli and your Dad had for you.

01:17:20.977 --> 01:17:22.879
I want thatkind of love.

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:27.017
What's holdingyou back?

01:17:34.891 --> 01:17:36.927
Okay.

01:18:28.745 --> 01:18:32.015
My whole life,I just didn't think Iwould get here like this.

01:18:33.617 --> 01:18:36.820
Did you ever see something likethis and think to yourself...

01:18:36.853 --> 01:18:39.990
If this is the lastbeautiful thing I see,

01:18:40.023 --> 01:18:42.092

You all sit downquickly

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.816
* ... early light,

01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:46.657
* What so proudly  we hail'd *

01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:52.796
* at the twilight's  last gleaming? *

01:19:52.829 --> 01:20:00.236
* Whose broad stripes  and bright stars, *

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:05.041
* thro' the  perilous fight, *

01:20:05.075 --> 01:20:08.244
You made it just in time forthe pledge of allegiance.

01:20:08.278 --> 01:20:11.181
Miles, it's theNational Anthem.

01:20:11.214 --> 01:20:13.216
It's the samething Mom!

01:20:13.249 --> 01:20:14.651
The only thingthat's the same

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:16.587
is that you put yourhand over your heart.

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.954
Yes, mam.

01:20:17.988 --> 01:20:19.155
That's what I thought.

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:21.825
* And the rockets'... *

01:20:21.858 --> 01:20:24.060
so as we get set forthis first round matchup

01:20:24.094 --> 01:20:26.096
between Shawn Barron  and Joseph Jenkins,

01:20:26.129 --> 01:20:27.297
one can only imagine

01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:29.833
what is going through  the young Jenkins mind,

01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:32.002
after all he's  been through.

01:20:32.035 --> 01:20:35.572
Should be quite a day,  we'll see if he can  handle the pressure.

01:20:35.606 --> 01:20:36.940
Speaking of guys that  can handle the pressure,

01:20:36.973 --> 01:20:39.009
our Diane Godwin is  with Johnny Lightneen.

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:42.646
Hello with Diane Godwin and Iam live back on the track.

01:20:42.679 --> 01:20:45.782
Today we've seen manygreat races and it's

01:20:45.816 --> 01:20:50.020
almost time to find out who thisyear's new champion will be.

01:20:50.053 --> 01:20:54.190
Standing right next to meis last year's winner andtop contender,

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:55.592
Johnny Lightneen.

01:20:55.626 --> 01:20:57.928
Why don't you tell us,what are you feeling rightat this moment?

01:20:57.961 --> 01:21:01.632
I mean you are on theverge of winning your nextchampion title,

01:21:01.665 --> 01:21:03.867
will Lightneenstrike twice?

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.236
Well first of all it's veryexciting to be here again.

01:21:06.269 --> 01:21:07.604
Uh-huh.

01:21:07.638 --> 01:21:10.206
But you never can tellwhat's going to go on withthis kind of talent.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.174
He's cute.

01:21:11.207 --> 01:21:12.843
No, No, No.

01:21:12.876 --> 01:21:14.611
He is not ascute as Joseph!

01:21:14.645 --> 01:21:16.146
Oh and you're notbiased at all?

01:21:16.179 --> 01:21:17.648
Come on!

01:21:21.351 --> 01:21:22.986
So the wait is  finally over,

01:21:23.019 --> 01:21:26.022
it is time for Shawn Baron  vs. Joseph Jenkins,

01:21:26.056 --> 01:21:29.993
as Jenkins rolls his  beautiful barracuda  towards the starting line

01:21:30.026 --> 01:21:32.796
here at a packed  Rockingham Dragway,

01:21:32.829 --> 01:21:35.832
all a part of the excitement  here at Dragstock X,

01:21:35.866 --> 01:21:38.769
and this is where  champions are made.

01:21:38.802 --> 01:21:41.772
This is where nerves take  over and if you can manage

01:21:41.805 --> 01:21:44.975
those nerves and  get past this round,

01:21:45.008 --> 01:21:47.978
the rest of the day could  be just a little bit easier.

01:21:48.011 --> 01:21:49.846
Right now he makes  his final adjustments.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.281
He'll get set to  do his burnout.

01:21:52.716 --> 01:21:55.318
Here we go ADRL fans,  make some noise.

01:21:55.351 --> 01:21:58.922
(Cheering and engines revving)

01:22:04.995 --> 01:22:07.330
The burnouts are complete and  Jenkins will purge the nitrous

01:22:07.363 --> 01:22:11.234
and get set to traverse  the 1/8th mile here at  Rockingham dragway.

01:22:14.004 --> 01:22:16.673
Jenkins is away green,  they are both off green,

01:22:16.707 --> 01:22:18.441
Barron at the  1/8th mile stripe,

01:22:18.474 --> 01:22:24.214
it's going to be  Jenkins running a 5.37  at a 129.05 mph.

01:22:24.247 --> 01:22:27.250
Now that's what Iam talking about come on.

01:22:27.283 --> 01:22:31.254
And the young man  is moving on to  round number 2

01:22:34.991 --> 01:22:38.995
Next up it's going to be Jason  Skynard taking on Jake Varner.

01:22:39.029 --> 01:22:41.364
Hey, this is the guy he isalways talking about.

01:22:41.397 --> 01:22:42.966
What the heck ishe doing there?

01:22:42.999 --> 01:22:45.301
And Skynard's away with  a huge whole shot.

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:48.138
He straps one on Varner  at the finish line,

01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:53.209
it's going to be Skynard  with the easy victory,  he is moving on.

01:22:53.243 --> 01:22:54.377
I don'tlike that boy.

01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:56.880
The honey badger doing  his thing right there

01:22:56.913 --> 01:22:59.449
and that is awesome  man, to see that car.

01:22:59.482 --> 01:23:01.151
Team Alan Obye and  that little mustang

01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:04.387
that's laid down the world's  fastest record, recorded run..

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.790
Those trailersare huge man.

01:23:06.823 --> 01:23:08.892
We're doing it man, weare really doing it.

01:23:10.126 --> 01:23:10.927
Hey guys,

01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:11.294
Hi,

01:23:11.327 --> 01:23:12.262
Hey Lizzy.

01:23:12.295 --> 01:23:13.263
Nice run out there today.

01:23:13.296 --> 01:23:14.765
Hey not too bad yourself.

01:23:14.798 --> 01:23:15.999
Thank you.

01:23:16.032 --> 01:23:18.434
Maybe one day I can runtop sportsman like you.

01:23:18.468 --> 01:23:19.870
Now you're talking.

01:23:19.903 --> 01:23:21.938
Yeah give you arun for your money.

01:23:21.972 --> 01:23:25.375
Ha ha ha Do you thinkyou can handle my class?

01:23:25.408 --> 01:23:27.410
Do you teachprivate lessons?

01:23:27.443 --> 01:23:29.012
We've got to goLizzy come on.

01:23:29.045 --> 01:23:31.281
I've got to go,I'll see you guys.

01:23:31.314 --> 01:23:32.282
Alright, see ya.

01:23:32.315 --> 01:23:33.016
Good luck out there.

01:23:33.049 --> 01:23:33.984
You too.

01:23:34.017 --> 01:23:36.152
Do you teachprivate lessons?

01:23:36.186 --> 01:23:37.187
Seriously?

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:38.354
-That was good man.-Stop play'n.

01:23:39.589 --> 01:23:41.758
Jason skynard, how do you feelabout going up against him?

01:23:41.792 --> 01:23:43.760
To get into the finals?

01:23:43.794 --> 01:23:45.762
That's funny, you know,the whole season

01:23:45.796 --> 01:23:47.898
I've been keeping my eye onhim, I've watched him,

01:23:47.931 --> 01:23:51.334
he sort of came out of leftfield and he's doing real well,

01:23:51.367 --> 01:23:55.271
so I would say today is goingto be a very interesting time.

01:23:55.305 --> 01:23:58.842
So up next it's going to  be Tony Cameron taking on  Joseph Jenkins,

01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:01.277
will the dream weekend  continue for Jenkins

01:24:01.311 --> 01:24:04.247
or will Cameron move on  to the final round,

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.449
we are just seconds  away from finding out.

01:24:06.482 --> 01:24:08.151
All the stage  bulbs are lit,

01:24:08.184 --> 01:24:09.419
the green light  is down and...

01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:21.431
(Heartbeat Sound -rhythm increasing)

01:24:28.304 --> 01:24:33.910
So Joseph Jenkins and  his beautiful 67 barracuda  go into the finals,

01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:36.379
but man you saw the  puff of smoke fans,

01:24:36.412 --> 01:24:37.948
he has hurt  that motor,

01:24:37.981 --> 01:24:39.950
no doubt in this  announcer's mind,

01:24:39.983 --> 01:24:42.318
they're going to have to  thrash between rounds,

01:24:42.352 --> 01:24:45.355
but none the less Jenkins  going to the finals,

01:24:45.388 --> 01:24:48.224
the American drag racing  leagues premiere event...

01:24:48.258 --> 01:24:49.159
Ha ha ha.

01:24:49.192 --> 01:24:50.193
Way to go Joe.

01:24:50.226 --> 01:24:51.461
... Are you kidding me

01:24:54.264 --> 01:24:55.498
Trace check theintake and the heads.

01:24:55.531 --> 01:24:57.000
What's the problem?

01:24:57.033 --> 01:24:59.035
I don't know, I definitelyfound a loss of power.Here get me out of here.

01:24:59.069 --> 01:25:00.203
No, no, no,take a break.

01:25:00.236 --> 01:25:02.372
I'll check it out,you get focused.

01:25:06.342 --> 01:25:08.378
How do you feel  about Joseph Jenkins?

01:25:08.411 --> 01:25:10.080
Joseph...

01:25:10.113 --> 01:25:10.981
uhm.

01:25:11.014 --> 01:25:12.548
I don't know reallywhat to tell you,

01:25:12.582 --> 01:25:14.918
except he's beenthrough a lot.

01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:16.252
Uhm, I've been very  impressed with him

01:25:16.286 --> 01:25:19.455
and I'm very interested to  see what he's going to do.

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:21.124
And actually you know,

01:25:21.157 --> 01:25:23.026
If I was going to say anythingto him right now, I would say

01:25:23.059 --> 01:25:26.930
"Hey Joseph, God blessyou buddy, good luck".

01:25:35.038 --> 01:25:36.139
It's thehead gasket.

01:25:36.172 --> 01:25:38.975
Either that or thehead's cracked.

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.210
How bad is it?

01:25:40.243 --> 01:25:42.979
I don't know I'm goingto have to pull it.

01:25:44.647 --> 01:25:46.216
How muchtime do we got?

01:25:46.249 --> 01:25:48.018
Not enough.

01:25:48.051 --> 01:25:50.020
Your lucky socks,do you got them?

01:25:55.391 --> 01:25:56.526
We've got a chance.

01:25:59.229 --> 01:26:00.363
Alright.

01:26:01.297 --> 01:26:01.998
[Sigh]

01:26:03.967 --> 01:26:05.101
See you back there.

01:26:10.473 --> 01:26:12.342
Alright, ADRL fans,  who's it going to be

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:15.045
taking on Jenkins in  the championship round?

01:26:15.078 --> 01:26:18.048
Will it be Johnny Lightneen  the defending champion

01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:21.417
and future ADLR hall of famer  in his 57 ford thunderbird,

01:26:21.451 --> 01:26:26.222
or the young up  start, Jason Skynard  in his 66 Chevy too

01:26:26.256 --> 01:26:29.059
here we go.

01:26:29.092 --> 01:26:32.228
Man'o man what a heartbreak  for Johnny Lightneen,

01:26:32.262 --> 01:26:34.464
he turns on  the red light,

01:26:34.497 --> 01:26:38.201
which means Jason Skynard  is going to the final round,

01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:40.503
Johnny Lightneen  is going home.

01:26:42.973 --> 01:26:44.374
I don'tlike that boy.

01:26:44.407 --> 01:26:46.209
... get through this  top sportsman Al Tucci,

01:26:46.242 --> 01:26:50.513
we are going to bring in  the original champion,

01:26:50.546 --> 01:26:53.583
dragstock back in 2004.

01:27:10.066 --> 01:27:11.601
This is it.

01:27:11.634 --> 01:27:14.070
Yeah it is,thanks for everything.

01:27:14.104 --> 01:27:16.639
You're welcomefor everything.

01:27:16.672 --> 01:27:18.708
Now go out thereand win this thing.

01:27:18.741 --> 01:27:20.043
You got it.

01:27:25.681 --> 01:27:28.651
Please tell meit's all fixed.

01:27:28.684 --> 01:27:30.253
Let's just say weput a bandage on it.

01:27:30.286 --> 01:27:31.354
Lie to me.

01:27:32.588 --> 01:27:34.190
It's all fixed.

01:27:34.224 --> 01:27:35.158
Good Job!

01:27:37.427 --> 01:27:39.662
So the traction twins  putting the final touches

01:27:39.695 --> 01:27:43.466
on this track surface  as we get set for our  championship matchup.

01:27:43.499 --> 01:27:49.572
Is it going to be Jason  Skynard or does the dream  weekend come to the ultimate  end,

01:27:49.605 --> 01:27:51.541
for Joseph Jenkins?

01:27:51.574 --> 01:27:54.277
They approach the water, it's  burnout time at the rock.

01:28:05.188 --> 01:28:07.423
In the words of hall of  fame announcer Al Tucci,

01:28:07.457 --> 01:28:10.126
"Beautiful  smokey burnout!"

01:28:33.283 --> 01:28:36.586
Both stage bulbs are lit,  Will it be Jenkins?

01:28:36.619 --> 01:28:38.288
Will it be Skynard?

01:28:38.321 --> 01:28:40.623
The tree comes down

01:28:40.656 --> 01:28:43.426
they're away and they're  both away clean and green  dead even off the start.

01:28:46.829 --> 01:28:49.099
Jenkins with a slight  lead on Skynard

01:28:50.866 --> 01:28:51.534
No!

01:28:51.567 --> 01:28:53.236
No!

01:28:53.269 --> 01:28:54.837
Awww another huge puff of  smoke again from Jenkin's car.

01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:58.308
Jenkins and Skynard are glued  together at the finish line,

01:28:58.341 --> 01:29:00.376
who's it going  to be?

01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:01.777
Who won?

01:29:01.811 --> 01:29:03.646
It's dead even, in all  my years of doing this

01:29:03.679 --> 01:29:07.583
we're going to have to go  to the 4 digit and triple  zero margin of entry,

01:29:07.617 --> 01:29:09.652
we have no idea who won,

01:29:09.685 --> 01:29:13.123
we'll go to our assistant  director of competition  Leida Corzine,

01:29:13.156 --> 01:29:15.758
take a look at the  computer printout.

01:29:15.791 --> 01:29:19.095
By one ten thousandth  of a second,

01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:21.564
my voice is shot  Rockingham

01:29:21.597 --> 01:29:26.736
Joseph Jenkins gets the  win the dream weekend  dragstock champion,

01:29:26.769 --> 01:29:27.703
can you  believe it?

01:29:28.538 --> 01:29:31.441
Cheering

01:29:44.687 --> 01:29:48.124
Heavenly Father thank you  so much for the family and  friends around us,

01:29:48.158 --> 01:29:50.860
we love you and we pray  for this food for the  nourishment of our bodies

01:29:50.893 --> 01:29:52.428
and our bodies to  your service.

01:29:52.462 --> 01:29:53.496
Amen.

01:29:54.664 --> 01:29:56.499
Amen, Very good

01:29:56.532 --> 01:29:58.534
[laughing]

01:30:00.703 --> 01:30:03.539
Who wants some of this...

01:30:03.573 --> 01:30:04.507
Green beans.

01:30:08.411 --> 01:30:10.446
[Thinking]  I thought my  life was over,

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:12.582
but it's now only  the beginning.

01:30:12.615 --> 01:30:15.585
I found the rush that  always satisfies.

01:30:15.618 --> 01:30:17.353
I discovered...

01:30:17.387 --> 01:30:18.854
It's not what you drive?

01:30:18.888 --> 01:30:21.691
it's what drives you.
