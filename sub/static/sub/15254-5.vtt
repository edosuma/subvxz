00:00.003 --> 00:00.970
<i>Hi I'm Chuck.</i>

00:00.995 --> 00:02.295
<i>Here are a few things that</i>
<i>you might need to know.</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:04.838
<i>You need to learn there are</i>
<i>repercussions for your actions.</i>

00:04.856 --> 00:06.340
<i>So, you're under arrest.</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:08.459
- For what?
- Attempted homicide.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.846
John Casey, you're
under arrest for murder.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:24.859 --> 00:26.827
How are you holding up?

00:26.861 --> 00:29.163
Well, the government
I proudly served for 20 years

00:29.197 --> 00:31.365
has locked me up with
the scum of the earth.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.399
I'm great.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.870
Hold out your hand.

00:41.443 --> 00:42.509
What is that?

00:42.544 --> 00:43.544
We have a plan

00:43.578 --> 00:45.712
to get you out of here.
- Just take it, okay?

00:45.747 --> 00:47.614
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

00:47.649 --> 00:49.049
to shrink blueprints
down to this size?

00:49.083 --> 00:50.617
The guy at Kinkos
thought I was crazy.

00:50.652 --> 00:52.453
Put that away. I am not
breaking out of prison.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.555
Casey, there is a very strong
case against you.

00:54.589 --> 00:57.558
Escape might be your only option
to get your life back.

00:57.592 --> 00:59.893
If I break out of prison,
I'm a fugitive.

00:59.928 --> 01:02.429
I don't run from the law.
I <i>am</i> the law!

01:02.464 --> 01:05.299
Now, Decker has me in here
for a reason.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.267
I'm gonna sit tight,
keep my head down,

01:07.302 --> 01:09.136
you figure out
what his angle is, okay?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.137
Fine.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.572
You gonna be
okay in here?

01:11.606 --> 01:15.742
Yeah... if that one
doesn't drive me insane.

01:16.678 --> 01:18.278
Okay, I admit it,

01:18.313 --> 01:20.914
I tried to poison you
to keep you subordinate.

01:20.949 --> 01:22.149
What is the big deal?

01:22.183 --> 01:23.150
I could have died.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.384
But you didn't!

01:24.402 --> 01:25.652
All right, look,

01:25.687 --> 01:29.439
recently I put some people
that I care about through a...

01:29.491 --> 01:31.158
through some rough times.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.060
That's the thing:
true friendship is,

01:33.094 --> 01:34.728
uh, it's confusing, isn't it?

01:34.762 --> 01:40.200
Mm. Look, guys, please, just,
ah, tell me what I have to do

01:40.234 --> 01:41.618
to get out of this place.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.605
It's so simple.
Okay, Jeff has agreed

01:44.639 --> 01:46.106
to drop all charges
under one condition.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.341
Okay.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.410
You promise not to poison
him anymore.

01:50.445 --> 01:52.429
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I can't promise that.

01:52.463 --> 01:54.515
Wake up, man! You are gonna get
yourself killed in this...!

01:54.549 --> 01:56.917
You know what? It doesn't
matter. I don't care, all right?

01:56.935 --> 01:58.251
Good luck in prison.
You know what?

01:58.269 --> 02:01.021
No, good luck to you both
finding a better Indian guy

02:01.055 --> 02:03.023
in your life
or at the Buy More!

02:03.057 --> 02:04.775
I will see you both in hell!

02:04.809 --> 02:06.627
Which is just what I call
"visiting hours."

02:06.661 --> 02:09.979
John, let's go back inside,
bench press some poundage.

02:10.031 --> 02:11.431
I'm gonna look
like a Hindu Michelangelo

02:11.466 --> 02:13.200
by the time I get out of here.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.484
Why, you...
John, move!

02:14.536 --> 02:18.705
I told him I was in here
for parking tickets.

02:18.740 --> 02:21.441
It takes every fiber of my body
not to drop that barbell

02:21.476 --> 02:22.676
right on his throat.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.312
Visiting hours are now over.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.014
I gotta get back in there.

02:27.048 --> 02:30.984
Check into Decker,
but be careful.

02:31.019 --> 02:32.953
He's capable of anything.

02:42.647 --> 02:43.630
Thank you.

02:43.665 --> 02:45.232
I can't help feeling
like Casey going

02:45.266 --> 02:46.650
to prison
is all my fault.

02:46.684 --> 02:48.235
What? Why would
you say that?

02:48.269 --> 02:50.437
'Cause I'm the genius who
started the private spy company

02:50.471 --> 02:52.105
and convinced you both
to work with me.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.273
Chuck, that's not true.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.108
Decker wanted Casey in jail
no matter what.

02:55.143 --> 02:56.977
I mean, whether we worked
for ourselves or the CIA,

02:56.995 --> 02:58.311
it doesn't really matter.

02:58.329 --> 03:00.847
And I'm not just saying that
to make you feel better.

03:00.882 --> 03:04.051
Well, maybe a little.

03:04.085 --> 03:05.752
Thank you.

03:05.787 --> 03:06.720
Chuck, you've got...

03:06.754 --> 03:07.521
Sarah, you got a...

03:07.555 --> 03:08.855
Oh, no.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.401
Sorry for the theatrics
getting you here.

03:21.436 --> 03:23.604
Sometimes it's
just more fun

03:23.638 --> 03:27.374
to knock somebody out
and toss them in a van.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.525
Why'd you bring us here?

03:28.559 --> 03:31.028
I need you to do a job for me.

03:31.062 --> 03:32.546
You throw our partner
in jail

03:32.580 --> 03:34.414
and now you want
a favor from us?

03:34.449 --> 03:37.217
In exchange, I will make all
of his charges disappear.

03:37.251 --> 03:41.355
Think of Mr. Casey as a
giant slab of leverage.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.740
We all know that stubborn
bastard will rot in prison

03:43.791 --> 03:45.192
unless I say otherwise.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.894
You have the entire CIA
under your thumb. Why us?

03:47.929 --> 03:49.696
This mission involves some

03:49.714 --> 03:51.932
extremely dangerous
technological terrorism.

03:51.966 --> 03:54.267
Sure, I have agents
who can write code,

03:54.302 --> 03:56.920
but none who can do
it as well as you can

03:56.971 --> 03:58.705
and handle themselves
in the field.

03:58.740 --> 04:00.974
There's no room for error here.

04:01.009 --> 04:02.409
We need you.

04:05.980 --> 04:11.051
Okay, we're listening.

04:11.069 --> 04:14.721
We've been tracking a computer
supervirus named the "Omen."

04:14.739 --> 04:17.524
Tech has only able to uncover
bits and pieces,

04:17.558 --> 04:20.661
but they assured me they've
never seen anything like it:

04:20.695 --> 04:23.063
metamorphic code capable
of erasing

04:23.081 --> 04:24.765
100 zettabytes of data
per second.

04:24.799 --> 04:27.668
What does any of that mean?

04:27.702 --> 04:30.570
It means that this virus could
essentially wipe out

04:30.605 --> 04:33.440
every database in the world in,
oh, five seconds.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.309
And just as we were
zeroing in on its origin,

04:36.344 --> 04:39.646
all signs of it disappeared.
That's why I need you.

04:39.681 --> 04:43.917
Locate the Omen, bring it back
to me, Mr. Casey goes free.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.687
And what if we say no?

04:46.721 --> 04:48.722
I have men on the inside

04:48.756 --> 04:51.091
who can make your friend's life
a living hell.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.160
Though, to be honest,

04:53.194 --> 04:55.495
I imagine hell will have no
trouble finding him in there.

04:59.067 --> 05:02.102
No fights.
Keep your nose clean.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.309
Harder than I thought.

05:23.391 --> 05:27.127
What do you think
you're doing, inmate?!

05:30.865 --> 05:32.199
Sorry if I got too physical.

05:32.233 --> 05:33.800
It's the uniform.

05:33.818 --> 05:36.203
Don't apologize.
I actually enjoyed it.

05:36.237 --> 05:38.705
Thought you would.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.075
Look, I'm glad you came
to see me.

05:42.110 --> 05:43.660
I have something
to discuss with you.

05:43.694 --> 05:45.362
Uh-uh! I'm all for business,

05:45.413 --> 05:47.080
but first,
wouldn't you like

05:47.115 --> 05:51.985
to take advantage of your
state-given right?

05:53.254 --> 05:55.839
What right is that?

05:55.873 --> 05:58.859
A conjugal visit.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.765
I would very much like
to take advantage of that right.

06:04.799 --> 06:07.000
I thought you might.

Maybe next time.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.643
What's on your mind?

07:08.677 --> 07:10.745
Listen, Bartowski and Walker
are damn good spies,

07:10.779 --> 07:13.014
but I don't like that
they're down a man,

07:13.048 --> 07:14.715
especially if Decker is up
to something.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.651
So you want me my team
to track them?

07:16.685 --> 07:18.286
Make sure they're safe?

07:18.320 --> 07:19.854
Not your team, you.

07:19.888 --> 07:22.123
I figured you could take
my place.

07:22.157 --> 07:26.410
Right, I'm gonna take orders
from Ward and June Cleaver.

07:28.363 --> 07:29.580
It was just a suggestion.

07:29.614 --> 07:31.782
Well, stop making suggestions.

07:31.833 --> 07:33.834
Okay. I'm done.

07:37.928 --> 07:40.396
It is hard to say no to you.

07:40.431 --> 07:41.981
I know.

07:48.188 --> 07:48.847
I hate this.

07:48.848 --> 07:50.715
I mean, do you remember
why we started

07:50.766 --> 07:52.016
Carmichael Industries
to begin with?

07:52.051 --> 07:54.168
Corporate discount on the
pinball machine, right?

07:54.186 --> 07:56.354
Ha. We did it to gain
independence.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.139
And where are we now?
Beholden to Decker,

07:58.173 --> 07:59.274
the exact type of person

07:59.308 --> 08:00.775
we said we'd never deal
with again.

08:00.810 --> 08:01.843
Stop it.

08:01.861 --> 08:03.728
You know we're doing
this to find Casey.

08:03.779 --> 08:04.863
I know, I know.

08:06.949 --> 08:09.684
All right, let's find us
a virus, shall we?

08:10.886 --> 08:12.554
Uh, what is happening?

08:12.588 --> 08:15.123
Is that,
is that chardonnay?

08:15.157 --> 08:16.825
I haven't seen this
in a long time.

08:16.859 --> 08:19.127
We used to call this routine
"The Routine."

08:19.161 --> 08:20.762
That's very creative.

08:20.796 --> 08:22.046
Yeah.

08:22.081 --> 08:24.082
Yeah, Chuck has
quite a reputation

08:24.133 --> 08:25.467
as a hacker,
you know?

08:25.501 --> 08:27.535
They used to call him
"The Piranha."

08:27.570 --> 08:28.837
<i>Swordfish,</i> right?

08:28.871 --> 08:30.722
The movie is based on him.
He doesn't like

08:30.756 --> 08:33.241
to talk about it 'cause he doesn't
think it was a A-plus film.

08:33.275 --> 08:34.642
Why? I thought
it was pretty good.

08:34.677 --> 08:36.744
Yeah, it's okay, but it had
a lot of plot holes

08:36.779 --> 08:37.912
and those hacker scenes
were just, like...

08:39.398 --> 08:43.067
Someone coded the name
into the Telix-script!

08:43.102 --> 08:45.770
A little inside joke for anyone
running viral countermeasures.

08:47.523 --> 08:51.526
When The Piranha got really
into a coding session,

08:51.560 --> 08:53.060
he could get a bit giddy.

08:53.078 --> 08:54.562
Yeah, it's kind of cute.

08:54.597 --> 08:56.764
Yeah, it's also super nerdy.

08:56.799 --> 08:57.899
It's definitely that, too.

08:59.585 --> 09:01.669
Got it!
The name was encrypted.

09:01.704 --> 09:04.205
So I ran an elliptic curve
algorithm to find the key.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.957
And of course after that,
it was cake.

09:07.543 --> 09:11.513
Well, hello, Colin Davis--
the man behind the Omen virus.

09:11.547 --> 09:13.481
Coming your way
in three, two, one.

09:13.516 --> 09:16.851
Guy was a head programmer
at The Collective;

09:16.886 --> 09:19.086
a rogue group of technological
terrorists who sold viruses

09:19.104 --> 09:20.438
to the highest bidder.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.807
Three months ago, he disappeared
with the key to the virus.

09:22.858 --> 09:24.826
Drop off the grid
crazy-guy style. I like that.

09:24.860 --> 09:26.528
Well, Mr. Colin Davis,
let's see

09:26.562 --> 09:29.280
if you left us any clues
as to where you went.

09:29.315 --> 09:32.116
Mm-hmm. Shoot. I promised Jeff
that I was gonna help him

09:32.151 --> 09:33.701
with this whole Lester thing.

09:33.736 --> 09:35.620
All right, guys,
you'll be okay here.

09:35.654 --> 09:37.205
Oh, make sure
that he eats.

09:37.239 --> 09:38.489
When he gets all plugged in,

09:38.541 --> 09:39.791
he goes overboard
with the chardonnay.

09:39.825 --> 09:40.808
Calls it his

09:40.843 --> 09:41.609
"thinking juice."

09:46.465 --> 09:47.916
Ah?
Ah.

09:47.950 --> 09:52.387
Thanks, buddy!
Love you!

09:58.344 --> 10:00.828
How's the brain, Mr. Grimes?

10:00.863 --> 10:04.232
It's, uh, it's
okay, Thanks.

10:06.068 --> 10:08.603
Casey sent me to help
with this Decker situation.

10:08.637 --> 10:11.506
So, if you'll be so kind
as to take me to the newlyweds.

10:11.540 --> 10:14.576
I can't, I can't bring
guests down to Castle.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.194
Are you really gonna
make me use this?

10:16.245 --> 10:19.197
You'd shoot me?

10:19.248 --> 10:21.049
I'd beat you over
the head with it.

10:23.185 --> 10:24.986
Well, this is Davis's
last known location.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.504
He must have brought
the virus here.

10:26.538 --> 10:29.224
Some kind of encampment
behind this barrier.

10:29.258 --> 10:31.226
It looks like some sort
of separatist compound.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.628
There could be a militia
training back there.

10:33.662 --> 10:35.380
Mm, Casey would have
loved this mission.

10:35.431 --> 10:36.831
And you're aware
that you're going

10:36.849 --> 10:39.350
to get yourselves killed
without Casey?

10:39.385 --> 10:42.336
I decided to let her in after
we had an adult conversation.

10:43.522 --> 10:46.340
What are you doing here,
Verbanski?

10:46.358 --> 10:49.343
Ease up, I'm not here to steal
any of your "precious secrets."

10:49.361 --> 10:52.013
I'm here because I'm going
on this mission with you.

10:52.031 --> 10:53.248
Oh, is that right?

10:53.282 --> 10:56.517
Look, we both want
Casey out of jail.

10:56.552 --> 10:58.853
You want
your partner back and I...

10:58.887 --> 11:02.123
I-I hate to see the competition
struggle like this.

11:02.157 --> 11:05.293
As far as I can tell, you need
a sniper on this mission.

11:05.327 --> 11:06.694
I've done some
pretty amazing

11:06.729 --> 11:09.464
sniper work
on <i>Call of Duty.</i>

11:09.498 --> 11:11.582
I believe I've made my point.

11:16.839 --> 11:19.540
Well, the sniper rifles are
behind you in the armory.

11:19.575 --> 11:22.043
I'll bring my own.

11:29.818 --> 11:32.053
Things can get really
nasty really fast,

11:32.087 --> 11:34.255
if you're not running
with the crowd in here.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.024
Is that a fact?

11:36.058 --> 11:37.592
You know, you look like
you can use some friends.

11:37.626 --> 11:40.061
And we could use some muscle
like you in the yard.

11:40.095 --> 11:42.997
I'll expect your
answer tonight.

11:45.534 --> 11:48.753
Dude, this place is no joke.

11:48.787 --> 11:51.039
Especially for a guy
with unpaid parking tickets.

11:51.073 --> 11:52.006
What do you want?

11:54.243 --> 11:55.793
Look, I've seen <i>Caged Heat.</i>

11:55.844 --> 11:57.411
I know how
to survive in prison.

11:57.429 --> 11:58.846
You gotta be
the shot-caller,

11:58.881 --> 12:00.348
and I think I've figured out
a way to do that.

12:00.382 --> 12:03.468
You know, <i>Caged Heat</i> was
a women's prison movie.

12:03.519 --> 12:06.020
Well, the lessons remain
the same, John.

12:08.774 --> 12:09.757
Hey, homes.

12:09.775 --> 12:11.392
Got that 12-gauge
you wanted, man.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.027
Word.

12:13.062 --> 12:15.063
Drop it in my cell.
Done.

12:32.748 --> 12:35.216
All right.
Easier than I thought.

12:41.657 --> 12:43.474
That sounds like some kind
of military drill.

12:43.509 --> 12:45.643
I'll look for cover.
Get ready for action.

13:03.212 --> 13:06.080
Okay, this is definitely
not a militia...

13:06.115 --> 13:08.816
Sarah, Sarah, I think
we walked into a cult.

13:08.834 --> 13:11.652
Way ahead of you.
Strip. Now.

13:11.670 --> 13:13.171
What-What-What-What?
What are you doing?

13:13.205 --> 13:14.839
What are you doing?
Joining a cult.

13:14.873 --> 13:16.424
Strip. Come on.

13:26.802 --> 13:29.237
Now keep a close eye.
I really have

13:29.271 --> 13:30.571
no place
to hide a gun.

13:30.606 --> 13:31.889
Not too close
an eye, though.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.108
I'm serious, for real,
no looking, thank you.

13:34.143 --> 13:36.010
Calm down.
No one's looking at anything.

13:36.044 --> 13:38.613
Not much to look at, anyway.

13:38.647 --> 13:39.864
That is not fair.

13:39.898 --> 13:41.566
I have nothing
to be ashamed of.

13:43.402 --> 13:44.852
Children...

13:44.870 --> 13:46.954
are you lost?

13:46.989 --> 13:49.457
Can I help the new arrivals
find their way?

13:49.491 --> 13:53.895
Uh, we were told to come
here to seek enlightenment.

13:53.929 --> 13:56.330
Then enlightenment
you shall find.

13:56.365 --> 13:58.583
Please... help yourself
to some robes.

13:58.634 --> 14:00.735
Welcome...

14:00.769 --> 14:04.071
to the Church of
the Eternal Wind.

14:04.106 --> 14:06.174
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.809
We'll just...

14:10.262 --> 14:11.746
We have uninvited guests.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.281
Find out who they are.

14:19.354 --> 14:20.421
We have a situation.

14:34.904 --> 14:37.206
It's a little...
little chilly under here.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.540
These are very
short robes, huh?

14:38.575 --> 14:39.942
Well, the church believes
that the spirit

14:39.976 --> 14:41.260
enters from underneath.

14:41.294 --> 14:43.128
Well, that's a totally
natural entry point.

14:44.747 --> 14:46.415
Uh, that's
an interesting pendant.

14:46.433 --> 14:49.351
I imagine it has some kind
of significance for you?

14:49.386 --> 14:50.969
All members of the church
wear a pendant

14:51.021 --> 14:52.587
to remind them of
their past lives.

14:52.605 --> 14:55.190
I worked on Wall Street,
lived the fast life.

14:55.225 --> 14:57.559
Till I came here.

14:57.594 --> 14:59.261
Not looking for
a life story here.

14:59.295 --> 15:01.263
Figure out where Davis is,
locate the virus.

15:01.281 --> 15:03.432
My patience is wearing thin.

15:03.466 --> 15:06.435
You know, my wife and I
were looking for an escape

15:06.453 --> 15:07.619
from our everyday chaos,

15:07.654 --> 15:09.738
and then our friend
Colin Davis recommended we come

15:09.772 --> 15:11.206
and check out
your church here.

15:11.241 --> 15:12.991
Oh, Colin-- what
a caring man.

15:13.043 --> 15:14.443
Now we call him Moon Meadow.

15:14.461 --> 15:15.794
That's his wind name.

15:15.829 --> 15:19.548
Uh, do you know where we could
find Moon Meadow?

15:19.582 --> 15:20.549
We'd love to see him.

15:20.583 --> 15:21.950
Mm.

15:21.968 --> 15:25.054
I believe he's leading a
drum circle, in the garden.

15:25.088 --> 15:27.389
It's mostly free-form,
experimental drumming.

15:27.424 --> 15:29.475
There'll definitely be
some jamming as well.

15:29.509 --> 15:31.093
Sounds like fun.

15:31.127 --> 15:32.344
Yeah! Let's go
check it out. Okay.

15:37.233 --> 15:39.635
Hey. How you
holding up, man?

15:39.669 --> 15:41.904
I didn't think it would

15:41.938 --> 15:43.305
be this hard without
Lester around.

15:43.323 --> 15:45.474
I'm starting to forget him.

15:45.508 --> 15:47.676
I can't even picture what
Lester looks like anymore.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.811
Close your eyes.

15:51.614 --> 15:55.017
Imagine David Beckham.

15:55.051 --> 15:57.486
Lester's a shorter,
feminine version of his wife.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.721
Right.
I can see him now.

15:59.756 --> 16:01.857
Yeah.

16:01.891 --> 16:05.177
Look, when I went through
my dark period,

16:05.211 --> 16:06.595
I alienated
a lot of friends.

16:06.629 --> 16:08.730
But thankfully, for me,
I was able to realize

16:08.765 --> 16:10.382
what I was about to lose,
before it was too late.

16:10.433 --> 16:12.351
We just have to make
sure he knows

16:12.385 --> 16:13.535
what's slipping
away here.

16:13.570 --> 16:15.137
I totally get it.

16:15.171 --> 16:16.438
This reminds me of the time

16:16.473 --> 16:17.773
my dad tried to win back my mom

16:17.807 --> 16:19.674
when he heard she was having sex
with Uncle Steve.

16:19.692 --> 16:21.743
They ended up
as a threesome.

16:21.778 --> 16:23.579
I had a messed-up
childhood.

16:23.613 --> 16:25.180
Yeah, you did.

16:25.215 --> 16:26.682
But, you know what?

16:26.716 --> 16:29.151
It actually gives me
a great idea

16:29.185 --> 16:30.619
how to handle Lester.

16:32.655 --> 16:33.922
It's not a threesome.

16:33.957 --> 16:35.991
These people dropped everything
and came here.

16:36.025 --> 16:37.743
- Can you imagine?
- Yeah, it's crazy.

16:37.794 --> 16:39.912
I mean, I don't know what
I'd do if I left the spy life.

16:39.963 --> 16:41.463
Sometimes I'm so
caught up in it,

16:41.498 --> 16:43.132
I can't think of a
world outside of it.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.833
Well, you're really good
at computers, Chuck.

16:44.867 --> 16:46.084
I mean, you love them.

16:46.136 --> 16:48.420
Yeah... maybe.

16:52.725 --> 16:54.343
I got eyes on Davis.

16:54.377 --> 16:55.894
I'm in position

16:55.929 --> 17:00.265
to shoot any and all
of these filthy hippies.

17:00.316 --> 17:02.717
It's almost like
Casey never left.

17:02.735 --> 17:03.819
Okay, stay focused.

17:03.853 --> 17:05.237
This is over as soon
as we find the virus.

17:05.271 --> 17:06.288
So let's just
get in and get out.

17:17.634 --> 17:19.601
I found
their clothes.

17:19.636 --> 17:21.537
And these were
with them.

17:43.476 --> 17:44.977
Chuck, Casey needs us.

17:45.028 --> 17:48.597
Wrap up the Phish concert,
make a move.

17:56.472 --> 17:58.123
All right!

18:01.644 --> 18:02.711
You got some skills.

18:02.745 --> 18:04.546
As do you, my friend.

18:04.581 --> 18:06.164
All right.

18:06.216 --> 18:09.501
So, uh, you worked
in tech, huh?

18:09.552 --> 18:11.336
Oh... a lifetime ago.

18:11.387 --> 18:14.840
And this-- this would've been
my crowning achievement.

18:14.891 --> 18:16.958
Till I walked away.

18:16.976 --> 18:19.261
You know, I used to work
in computers, as well.

18:19.295 --> 18:21.129
You mind if I take
a look at that?

18:21.147 --> 18:22.797
Oh, no, no, I couldn't.

18:22.815 --> 18:24.966
It's against church policy
to ever remove your pendant.

18:24.984 --> 18:27.802
But I do take it off
twice a month, when I shower.

23:36.883 --> 23:40.519
it was my finest work.

23:40.553 --> 23:44.523

I just... couldn't.

Hey, uh...

23:48.194 --> 23:49.461
I understand.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.496
It's just, I tried to get
out of that life, you know,

23:51.530 --> 23:52.698
and now it's sucking me back in.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.132

to outrun something

23:54.167 --> 23:56.368
I shouldn't have done
in the first place.

23:56.386 --> 23:58.170
I get it, Colin.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.938
Believe me, I do.

23:59.973 --> 24:02.140
And I assure you,
we're the good guys here.

24:04.177 --> 24:06.111
I hope to God
you're telling me the truth.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.219
There are two parts
to the virus:

24:14.253 --> 24:15.921
a chip and
a distribution device--

24:15.955 --> 24:18.123
it's like a modded
USB drive.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.958
You insert the chip
into the device,

24:19.993 --> 24:23.528
and the virus
can be uploaded...

24:23.563 --> 24:25.464
to any system.

24:25.498 --> 24:28.633
I'm hoping you didn't
swallow the device, as well.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.937
No, it's still locked up
at The Collective,

24:31.971 --> 24:33.905
my former employer.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.440
Right. Right,
right, right.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.093
Uh, so-so what you're saying
then is we just need to

24:38.127 --> 24:40.512
sneak past a few hackers
and get the device back?

24:40.546 --> 24:42.247
No, it's not that easy.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.316
There are some
extremely dangerous people

24:44.350 --> 24:46.284
selling these viruses.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.420
Can you help us get in?

24:48.454 --> 24:50.639
Best I can do is access
the schematics of the building,

24:50.690 --> 24:52.090
show you where they're
storing the device.

24:52.108 --> 24:53.959
Okay, great.
That's a great start.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.944
Thank you.
I'll go grab a computer.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.700
Listen, is there anything
I can get you while I'm up?

25:01.734 --> 25:02.701
Our kitchen's fully stocked.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.286
Sandwich? Nachos?

25:04.320 --> 25:05.937
We have some of those
gourmet jellybeans.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.973
You have the kind that tastes
like buttered popcorn?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.043
I think I can make that happen.

25:14.447 --> 25:15.547
A snack?

25:15.581 --> 25:16.715
Casey's in lockdown,

25:16.749 --> 25:19.167
and this jerk
wants jellybeans?

25:19.218 --> 25:22.838
We should just cut him open
and get that chip out right now.

25:22.889 --> 25:26.858
You know, I know that we're not
partners or friends

25:26.893 --> 25:28.894
or anything like that,
but are you okay?

25:28.928 --> 25:30.679
You seem to be on
edge ever since

25:30.730 --> 25:32.130
we started the mission.
I'm fine.

25:32.165 --> 25:34.066
Really? 'Cause we can
talk about it if you want.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.067
No, no, no, no.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.668
We-We don't talk, okay?

25:36.702 --> 25:37.869
I'm-I'm just off.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.671
Stop trying to be
my shrink.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.690
Okay.

25:46.329 --> 25:49.915
Is it, um... about Casey?

25:52.702 --> 25:55.287
I just noticed that you have
some emotions for him.

25:55.321 --> 25:59.091
Can we stop with this garbage
and just get to work?

25:59.125 --> 26:00.759
You know, you can still
have feelings for somebody

26:00.793 --> 26:01.893
and still be a good spy.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.895
Oh, and be like you
and Mr. Hospitality?

26:03.930 --> 26:05.397
That's my fate?

26:05.431 --> 26:06.381
No.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.433
No, no, no.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.226
So I've been noticing
Lester popping up online

26:18.277 --> 26:19.811
about the same
time every day.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.446
Fancy prison.

26:21.481 --> 26:22.981
Yeah, right.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.216
So, look, we
initiate a chat,

26:24.250 --> 26:27.552
and then we begin Operation:
Scare Lester Straight.

26:27.587 --> 26:28.820
Ready?

26:36.045 --> 26:37.929
Hello, friends.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.532
Guess you couldn't
live without me, huh?

26:40.566 --> 26:43.168
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
to tell you this,

26:43.202 --> 26:44.569
but, uh, we've been
interviewing people

26:44.604 --> 26:46.371
to fill your spot
at the Buy More.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.673
Oh, come on. Right.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.709
What, are you gonna
just-just replace me?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.594
Actually, he just
showed up.

26:57.150 --> 26:59.100
Who is this fool?

26:59.152 --> 27:01.853
This is our new Nerd Herder,
Vali Chandrasekaren.

27:01.888 --> 27:04.422
Oh, come on!

27:04.457 --> 27:05.824
That is a pretty stupid name.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.359
Where are you from,
Mr. Fake Name?

27:07.393 --> 27:08.760
Look at my face.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.263
You can't tell I'm from
Montreal, like all true Hinjews?

27:11.297 --> 27:12.531
Oh, no, you did not.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.232
I did. And I am.

27:14.267 --> 27:15.567
Listen, I just wanted
to say thanks

27:15.601 --> 27:17.269
for giving up your spot
at the Buy More.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.570
Some great people here.

27:18.588 --> 27:21.289
I'm excited to start
getting to know everybody.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.258
Lester, you should hear
this guy's singing voice.

27:23.292 --> 27:24.376
Like an angel.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.443
Come on.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.511
It really is though.

27:26.546 --> 27:28.547
♪ O Canada ♪

27:38.224 --> 27:39.758
That's just a little bit,
you know.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.459
My word.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.295
You know, many people say
it's the type of voice

27:43.329 --> 27:46.798
that would go perfectly
with a-- I don't know-- keytar.

27:48.634 --> 27:51.469
May I have a moment alone
with Jeffrey, please?

27:51.504 --> 27:53.822
Of course.
Sure, sure.

27:58.211 --> 27:59.444
Well done, well done.

27:59.462 --> 28:00.879
Yeah, yeah, perfect.
You nailed it.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.581
Your voice-- wow, you
really underplayed it.

28:02.615 --> 28:03.948
- No, it's fine.
- Yeah.

28:03.966 --> 28:05.500
You earned this.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.786
Okay, this one's just Wi-Fi.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.821
You know, the Indian Modeling
Agency, they said that

28:09.855 --> 28:13.358
you'd give me one of the good
ones if I helped you out, so...

28:16.295 --> 28:18.463
You know this comes
out of my salary.

28:18.497 --> 28:21.149
Don't care one bit.

28:21.183 --> 28:22.984
Jackpot!

28:24.854 --> 28:26.838
Who's the new guy?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.106
Don't worry about it.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.141
I'll find out myself.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.615
You know, it is amazing.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.784
They're like little
popcorn pills, you know?

28:39.819 --> 28:40.952
Whoa, whoa!

28:40.987 --> 28:42.721
What are you doing?
He agreed to help us.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.056
I just wanted to extend
our full hospitality

28:45.091 --> 28:46.958
to our guest, make sure
he's perfectly comfortable

28:46.993 --> 28:48.493
while we wait

28:48.527 --> 28:49.861
patiently for the chip.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.396
I was just telling
your partner...

28:51.430 --> 28:53.398
He's not my
partner. Go on.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.234
The Collective has
an unbreakable security system.

28:56.269 --> 28:58.520
But it does have one weakness.

28:58.554 --> 29:00.338
It can be
manipulated

29:00.356 --> 29:01.890
from the inside.

29:04.710 --> 29:08.079
Man, these jellybeans
taste... funny.

29:09.282 --> 29:11.583
Just speeding up
the process a little bit.

29:30.086 --> 29:33.171
You've got something
on your shirt.

29:33.205 --> 29:36.007
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

29:37.310 --> 29:39.344
Keep it in the can.
Keep it in the trash can.

29:44.506 --> 29:45.399
What do you think?

29:45.400 --> 29:46.566
Do I look like a hacker?

29:46.601 --> 29:47.801
Is the beanie overkill?

29:47.835 --> 29:48.902
You look perfect.

29:48.937 --> 29:51.939
Okay, I found a duct opening

29:51.973 --> 29:53.974
on the east corner,
just below the roof.

29:54.008 --> 29:55.375
Okay, we have our entry.

29:55.410 --> 29:57.411
At exactly 2200 hours,
we'll be in the server room,

29:57.445 --> 29:59.112
waiting for you to override
the security system.

29:59.147 --> 30:00.480
Got it.

30:00.515 --> 30:01.481
Be careful, babe.

30:01.516 --> 30:02.716
You, too.

30:14.428 --> 30:16.663
I'm here for a job.

30:23.988 --> 30:27.107
You realize what happens
if you don't get the job?

30:29.143 --> 30:30.844
I do.

30:53.334 --> 30:55.635
Welcome to The
Collective,

30:55.653 --> 30:57.738
the very best of
the very best.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.990
You said you
want a job.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.358
Let's prove it.

31:02.810 --> 31:03.777
Sit.

31:03.811 --> 31:05.579
Okay.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.613
Hi.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.651
Freddie is my
best programmer.

31:11.669 --> 31:13.120
If you can
prove your skills

31:13.154 --> 31:14.654
up against him,

31:14.689 --> 31:16.690
then you have the job.

31:16.724 --> 31:18.375
But if you fail...

31:21.679 --> 31:24.164
...you might not be
so fortunate.

31:24.198 --> 31:27.884
So, a good old-fashioned
hack off, huh?

31:29.503 --> 31:30.854
Great. Perfect.

31:30.888 --> 31:32.172
I'm just gonna take a moment to

31:32.190 --> 31:33.974
get prepared,
if you don't-don't mind.

31:36.694 --> 31:39.730
Boom.

31:39.781 --> 31:41.648
Oh, once you've had Rombauer,

31:41.682 --> 31:44.401
you just can't go back
to any other Chardonnay.

31:44.452 --> 31:45.535
Who are you?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.220
I've been out of the
game for a little while,

31:47.255 --> 31:49.489
but they used to call me
The Piranha.

31:49.524 --> 31:51.541
There's no way.

31:55.229 --> 31:57.247
Let's do this, huh?

32:12.430 --> 32:13.847
Okay,

32:13.881 --> 32:15.515
the first person
that hacks

32:15.550 --> 32:17.434
into Federal Reserve
and transfers

32:17.485 --> 32:20.253
one penny into
secure account wins.

32:20.288 --> 32:21.571
Are we clear?

32:22.924 --> 32:24.224
Begin!

32:33.634 --> 32:34.868
Freddie's an expert

32:34.902 --> 32:36.937
at subverting complex
security systems.

32:36.971 --> 32:40.373
He is the reason our own system
is so secure.

32:40.408 --> 32:42.092
Oh, yeah, I can tell.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.511
He did a great job.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.914
That's my man.

33:04.532 --> 33:06.633
You seem to know your way
around a computer.

33:06.667 --> 33:08.485
I'm sorry, are we still talking?

33:08.536 --> 33:09.836
I'm kind of busy here.

33:09.871 --> 33:12.439
You know what? You actually have
a little hiccup there

33:12.473 --> 33:13.907
at the bottom
of your page.

33:13.941 --> 33:15.775
A compiler can't optimize
a value away like that.

33:15.810 --> 33:17.327
Just want to...

33:17.378 --> 33:20.013
Yeah, there you go.

33:20.047 --> 33:22.132
Rookie mistake.
I'm sure it won't happen again.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.466
Oh, I'm losing!

33:23.501 --> 33:24.918
Better get back

35:39.620 --> 35:41.221
Whoa-uh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

35:41.255 --> 35:44.607
Before you use that I've got
a little business tip for you.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.092
And what is that?

35:46.127 --> 35:48.328
You should really look
into finding

35:48.362 --> 35:49.396
a better security expert.

35:50.765 --> 35:51.931
Freddie! Alarms!

35:53.868 --> 35:55.635
Fixed it!

35:57.405 --> 35:58.455
Find him!

35:58.489 --> 36:01.474
Guys, I'm in trouble!
Coming your way!

36:08.983 --> 36:11.351
I don't think I got the job.

36:12.386 --> 36:14.620
Let's get out of here.
Go, go, go!

36:23.056 --> 36:24.214
Your plan worked.

36:24.215 --> 36:26.616
As soon as Lester saw
the other better Lester,

36:26.634 --> 36:29.185
he changed his tune.
That's fantastic!

36:29.220 --> 36:30.787
He said he wouldn't
poison me anymore,

36:30.805 --> 36:32.856
so I dropped the charges.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.357
He'll be back at
work tomorrow.

36:34.392 --> 36:35.692
Mm, man,
I can't wait.

36:35.726 --> 36:38.161
This wasn't really about
me and Lester, was it?

36:38.195 --> 36:39.596
Mm, I don't know.

36:39.630 --> 36:43.633
There's someone who hasn't
forgiven your dickish behavior.

36:43.668 --> 36:45.201
And you need
to right that wrong.

36:50.408 --> 36:52.325
I'm talking about
John Casey.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.277
I know, dude.
I'm not brain damaged.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.512
I'm sorry. Too soon?

36:55.546 --> 36:56.546
That's... I don't...

37:02.086 --> 37:04.154
You want me
to do the talking?

37:04.188 --> 37:06.556
No. It was supposed to be
me and Chuck.

37:06.591 --> 37:08.725
We don't want to do anything
to spook Decker.

37:08.759 --> 37:10.393
You should probably
make yourself scarce.

37:17.201 --> 37:18.535
So, I've been, uh,

37:18.569 --> 37:22.172
I've been thinking about life
after the spy game.

37:22.206 --> 37:25.342
What do you mean?

37:25.376 --> 37:29.913
You know, maybe you're right;
I'm, I'm great with computers.

37:29.947 --> 37:32.415
I mean, maybe Carmichael
Industries isn't a spy firm.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.684
Maybe it's a tech company.

37:34.719 --> 37:37.487
What do you think?

37:40.524 --> 37:42.859
Sarah?

37:42.893 --> 37:47.597
Uh, what would my job be
at Carmichael Industries?

37:47.632 --> 37:50.066
I mean, what would I do?

37:53.871 --> 37:54.904
Well, you'd...

37:56.173 --> 37:57.841
He's here.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.024
Did you bring the virus?

38:14.058 --> 38:15.659
The deal, it's still good?

38:15.693 --> 38:16.926
John Casey goes free?

38:28.139 --> 38:30.106
Here.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.792
What are you planning
on doing with it?

38:32.843 --> 38:36.312
This?
The real question is,

38:36.347 --> 38:38.114
what do you plan
to do with it, Chuck?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.884
What are you
talking about?

38:40.918 --> 38:45.855
I got some good footage of you
and your team in possession

38:45.890 --> 38:50.193
of the most dangerous computer
virus in the world.

38:51.328 --> 38:52.962
Smile.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.634
Don't worry, we'll release
the virus,

38:57.668 --> 38:58.968
but you'll get the blame.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.671
That should get you
on the FBI's

39:01.706 --> 39:03.073
most wanted list
pretty quickly.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.008
So, this was a setup.

39:05.042 --> 39:06.576
You set us up?

39:06.610 --> 39:08.511
You know,
now that I think of it,

39:08.546 --> 39:10.280
it was pretty irresponsible
to release Casey

39:10.314 --> 39:12.148
into the hands
of his criminal colleagues.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.651
That's enough
of this nonsense.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.986
You release Casey now.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.290
Gertrude, what's happening
is bigger than just me.

39:20.324 --> 39:21.491
The Plan is in motion.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.859
It's too late
for all of you.

39:22.893 --> 39:26.763
It's just a shame that Casey had
to be the first to die.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.502
Give me one reason
not to kill you.

39:32.536 --> 39:33.937
Go ahead.

39:33.971 --> 39:35.605
It will only further prove
your guilt.

39:35.639 --> 39:38.041
So, I suggest
you get your hands off me

39:38.075 --> 39:40.643
and get a little head start,

39:40.678 --> 39:43.079
because soon, people
will be hunting Chuck,

39:43.114 --> 39:45.315
the way they hunted Bin Laden.

39:48.686 --> 39:50.003
Go.

Let's go.
Let's go right now.

Hey, Decker.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.238
Aren't you forgetting something?

40:10.407 --> 40:14.644
Don't worry, I left
a little consolation prize.

40:26.991 --> 40:28.057
He deserved that.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.876
Go. Go, go, go! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

You didn't.

I understand.

We could've been something.

41:21.545 --> 41:22.879
Still can be.

out of here alone?
