WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.236
- Previously on Nashville...
- Just telling these guys

00:02.270 --> 00:03.337
how great we thought
y'all were tonight.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.539
- You don't feel like there
was a lack of cohesion?

00:05.573 --> 00:07.541
- Maybe Avery has a point,
maybe y'all should figure out

00:07.575 --> 00:09.177
who you are as a group
a little bit, you know?

00:09.210 --> 00:10.711
Instead of just
as individuals.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.780
- I want to go back to
the place you were yesterday.

00:12.813 --> 00:17.051
The man you called "uncle",
where is he?

00:17.085 --> 00:20.188
- No! No!

00:20.221 --> 00:23.391
- You're safe.
You're all right.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.493
- I'm walking around
with a piece of me gone,

00:25.526 --> 00:28.196
and I don't want to
wreck this thing--

00:28.229 --> 00:30.198
- Shut up.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.102
- Come and get it!

00:34.135 --> 00:35.169
- Oh, my God,
that smells so good.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.737
- You're welcome.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.539
- Did I ever tell you you're
an amazing big sister?

00:38.572 --> 00:40.808
- No, but thank you.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.310
Too bad Dad's not here.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.311
Where is he anyway?

00:45.313 --> 00:47.248
- That is not true.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.682
- Oh my God, it's so true
and you know it.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.451
- It's not!
Why would you even think that?

00:50.484 --> 00:54.122
- Because you were always
so stern and grumpy.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.389
- That's just my face.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.325
- Oh, that's what it was.
Okay.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.492
- It was.
You kidnapped me

00:58.526 --> 00:59.660
and you threw me
in the damn woods.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.762
- Yeah, and how
did that turn out?

01:01.795 --> 01:03.297
- Yeah, it was pretty good.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.598
- You didn't like me.
Just admit it.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.799
- You are so nuts.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.303
- Oh, my God, this is so good.

01:09.337 --> 01:12.206
- Who knew all we had to do
was go get a burger together?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.175
- And fries.
- Yep.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.610
- Oh my God.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.479
- You got...

01:18.512 --> 01:20.148
- All over.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.216
- Okay.

01:26.587 --> 01:31.859
- * And then those
funny familiar... *

01:31.892 --> 01:35.163
- I should warn you that
I don't really dance.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.897
- That's okay.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.367
- Yeah.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.536
- Well, close your eyes.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.210
- And now just
don't do anything.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.306
- Are we just supposed
to go home now?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.540
- I guess so.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.278
Do you want to come over?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.883
- Pretty sure.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.325
- Um...

02:38.326 --> 02:40.228
- Nothing.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.331
- Protection.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.932
- Oh.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.337
I'm sorry. I haven't
thought about that part.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.872
- That's okay.
I haven't either.

02:51.905 --> 02:56.610
- I could probably go to a
drugstore now or something?

02:56.644 --> 03:00.248
Far away, I guess.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.849
- Maybe we should just wait.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.887
- We could absolutely
wait, yeah.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.922
- Yeah. Wait till
the girls are both

03:08.956 --> 03:10.458
out of the house
one night...

03:10.491 --> 03:11.525
- Yeah, and Jake's
at his dad's...

03:11.559 --> 03:13.827
- At his dad's, yeah, yeah.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.363
That'd be better?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.664
- Yeah, that'd
be better, right?

03:16.697 --> 03:17.765
Don't you think?

03:17.798 --> 03:19.467
- Yeah.
- Okay. Good.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.706
- Yeah, they're back in
Atlanta first week of June.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.707
But we should be able
to work out something

03:26.740 --> 03:28.008
in New York after that.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.278
- Bucky, I told you
nothing after May.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.645
- Come on.
Let's do this.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.481
- This thing in New York
is a huge deal.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.283
- I'm in the studio
with my band in June.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.550
- Oh, that's cute.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.286
- That like a
side project or...

03:38.319 --> 03:40.321
- Shut up.
- Come on. Let's do this.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.923
- All right.
From the chorus.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.825
- * Go with it

03:44.858 --> 03:47.495
* Let's put a little bit
of soul in it *

03:47.528 --> 03:48.762
* I got a feeling that

03:48.796 --> 03:52.600
* You and I got
something so good *

03:53.834 --> 03:55.803
* Don't stop it

03:55.836 --> 03:58.506
* What I want, girl,
you got it *

03:58.539 --> 03:59.773
* I got a feeling that

03:59.807 --> 04:02.710
* You and I got
something so good *

04:02.743 --> 04:04.745
- * So good...

04:06.046 --> 04:07.715
- All right, guys.
I got a question.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.483
Why is it always me singing
the high girly parts?

04:09.517 --> 04:11.051
- 'Cause you're the one
with the high girly voice.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.322
- Okay. What if we got an actual
girl to sing those parts?

04:14.355 --> 04:16.490
- Oh, then we could
get rid of you.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.991
- I'm serious.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.060
I mean, you know, somebody
who's great to look at.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.962
Super talented and
can sing high.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.764
- Yeah.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.899
I think it's a good idea.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.601
- I mean, it's not
the craziest idea.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.703
- Little Big Town,
Alabama Shakes.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.004
It's working real
well for them.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.607
- Maybe this boyband
does need a girl.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.043
- Yeah.
Let's go find us a girl.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.048
- Hey.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.955
I can't imagine what you must
be going through right now.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.560
To have to re-experience
all that pain.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.096
- I mean, I think it's good.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.033
This thing was running
my whole life

05:00.067 --> 05:01.702
without me even knowing it.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.740
I was a little girl
and was raped.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.611
- It's so hard to even
hear those words.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.482
- Who knows what would
have been different?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.350
Maybe everything.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.656
- Well, it makes sense.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.392
Maybe every choice
I've ever made

05:24.425 --> 05:26.727
has been affected
by this in some way.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.897
- Yeah.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.935
- Don't.
Don't go there. I mean...

05:34.968 --> 05:37.905
- I mean, if it's true,
I want to know.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.106
- Look, I'm just trying
to figure out

05:39.139 --> 05:41.074
my own life right now.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.877
And I'm a long, long way
from getting there.

05:45.546 --> 05:49.082
Even us?

06:04.965 --> 06:08.101
- Oh, my God, this is
taking forever today.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.871
- Oh my God.
Seriously?

06:10.904 --> 06:12.172
- Like you're gonna be late
if these people

06:12.205 --> 06:14.442
don't get a move on it.
Let's go.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.676
- Maddie, watch this!

06:15.709 --> 06:17.110
- * You took what's mine

06:17.144 --> 06:18.546
* Now I got to clip
your wings *

06:18.579 --> 06:20.113
* I know what's up

06:20.147 --> 06:23.116
- Wait...
- I thought they broke up.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.987
- * Maddie J,
you're in the way *

06:27.020 --> 06:29.790
- Oh, my God!

06:29.823 --> 06:31.959
- * You can't have him!

06:31.992 --> 06:33.961
- This is insane!

06:33.994 --> 06:35.729
- Wait, do you want me
to stay with you? I can.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.666
- No, you gotta go. I'm okay.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.480
- Hi.
I was gonna call you.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.681
- Well, I beat you to it.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.752
Listen, I was thinking about
our scheduling issue.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.891
- Um, I'm playing the Bluebird
tomorrow night, as you know.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.158
But the night after
that is starting

07:05.192 --> 07:07.661
to look kind of wide open.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.863
Maddie's got plans and
Daphne's got a sleepover.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.065
- Well, that's great,
actually.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.702
Because Jake will be
at his father's, so...

07:14.735 --> 07:18.506
- Okay.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.008
- Okay, great.
Bye.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.543
- Okay. Bye.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.114
- Phew.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.448
Okay.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.785
- * And they say
try to hide *

07:31.819 --> 07:37.525
* The anxious inside
'cause they know *

07:37.558 --> 07:44.698
* Paranoid of nothing
in their control *

07:44.732 --> 07:48.569
- * We parted ways, I came
upon a grave of bodies *

07:48.602 --> 07:49.970
* Left in my own wake

07:50.003 --> 07:52.740
* A boneyard of mistakes

07:52.773 --> 07:55.609
* Saw my own face
on every one of them *

07:55.643 --> 07:57.177
* Now I struggle with
the grace *

07:57.210 --> 07:58.812
* To forgive and let erase

07:58.846 --> 08:02.550
- * Look at me now

08:02.583 --> 08:04.618
* After...

08:04.652 --> 08:08.255
* After I said
I'd rather be alone *

08:08.288 --> 08:09.890
Sorry.

08:09.923 --> 08:13.694
Sorry, it feels like
I'm a little off-key.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.028
Let me just, um...
start again.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.964
- This is not working.
- It was painful.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.066
- At this rate,
this is gonna take months.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.603
Somebody who has a cousin
who can sing...

08:23.971 --> 08:25.072
Someone's cousin?
Come on, man.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.574
- I didn't mean literally.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.575
- Gunnar's just gonna
have to go back

08:27.608 --> 08:29.076
to singing the high parts.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.578
- Gunnar's not going back
to sing the high parts.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.280
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Listen.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.783
Who's that?

08:35.816 --> 08:38.251
- * It ain't over now

08:38.285 --> 08:40.153
* Wherever you are

08:40.187 --> 08:42.656
* That's where
I'm gonna find you *

08:42.690 --> 08:46.694
* All that you forgot
That's what I will remind you *

08:46.727 --> 08:49.296
* A counterattack,
tit for tat *

08:49.329 --> 08:52.232
* Back again
No, I'm not your friend *

08:52.265 --> 08:55.102
* Not here to make amends

08:55.135 --> 08:57.237
* Every scar you left on me

08:57.270 --> 08:59.673
* I'm gonna make a match

08:59.707 --> 09:03.611
* Cut you with a dagger
That you left in my back *

09:03.644 --> 09:06.313
* Honey, I ain't
even gotten even *

09:06.346 --> 09:09.983
* So it ain't the end

09:10.017 --> 09:16.690
* Sweet revenge

09:18.659 --> 09:21.629
* Just because you
got me good *

09:21.662 --> 09:24.264
* Don't mean
that's it's over *

09:24.297 --> 09:28.368
* It ain't over

09:35.242 --> 09:38.211
- That, that was great.
- You're amazing.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.313
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.282
My name's Avery and we're...
- We're looking for someone...

09:42.315 --> 09:43.851
- Somebody exactly like you.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.919
- That's interesting.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.755
- Sorry. We're just kind
of blown away.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.089
See, we got a band.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.624
We're looking for
a backup singer.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.992
- But you probably don't
want to do that.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.695
We just thought--
- I'm Will, by the way.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.664
- I know. Will Lexington.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.834
And you're Avery Barkley.
And you're Gunnar Scott.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.770
I'm Alannah, by the way.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.004
I don't get it.
You guys don't sing together.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.875
- Well, we kind of do.
- Do now.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.244
- Okay.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.246
- Imagine your life,
your whole life

10:13.280 --> 10:15.716
up to now without
the trauma in it.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.419
What kind of mother
would you have been?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.388
Would you even have
become a mother

10:21.421 --> 10:25.959
or a wife or a celebrity?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.194
- Maybe not.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.331
Maybe if I didn't need

10:31.364 --> 10:33.366
constant approval from
other people, I...

10:33.400 --> 10:36.970
- You are an amazing
human being, Juliette.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.872
Don't ever forget that.

10:38.906 --> 10:42.042
- I've always felt cut off
from other people.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.444
Like I was frozen inside.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.881
- Yet look at the way you've
attracted so many people to you.

10:47.915 --> 10:51.785
You became a charming,
captivating,

10:51.819 --> 10:55.956
irresistible narcissist
because you had to.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.792
This event happened
when you were too young

10:58.826 --> 11:00.360
to even begin
to understand it.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.196
- How can I possibly begin
to process all this?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.465
- You already have.

11:05.498 --> 11:09.469
You processed it the moment
you recovered the memory.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.739
It's what you've been searching
for your whole life.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.374
- Okay.
And what now?

11:14.407 --> 11:17.144
- You're in a very
powerful place right now.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.946
You had a transformation.

11:18.979 --> 11:23.784
It's time to serve,
to help others.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.219
We have an outreach program
I think you'll respond to.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.155
What is that?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.456
- It's working
with young children

11:29.489 --> 11:34.227
who've endured terrible
trauma and loss.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.863
It's in Bolivia.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.497
- Mm-hmm.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.866
You'll leave in a few days.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.935
No!
I can't do that!

11:41.969 --> 11:43.503
- The time to act is now

11:43.536 --> 11:48.108
before your daily life
dilutes your awakening.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.944
It's just two weeks.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.380
You need to see if
this is your path.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.290
- Yeah.
It's a real small town.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.159
- Only child, actually.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.897
I was alone a lot growing up.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.799
Total geek in high school.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.534
I felt invisible until
I discovered music.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.370
Then it was like none of
that mattered anymore.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.472
So I just left home
when I was 16.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.475
I could not get out of
there fast enough.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.977
- I can relate to that.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.178
- I mean, I just wanted
to find people,

12:25.212 --> 12:26.847
anyone who was like me.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.517
- So how long you
been in Nashville?

12:30.550 --> 12:32.953
- A couple of months.
I really love it.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.823
You don't mind the
competitiveness?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.157
Everybody trying to make it?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.860
- Uh, I don't
really think about it.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.494
I just love making music.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.397
And if it's meant to happen,
I figure it'll happen.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.833
- Good attitude.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.234
- I got a question.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.002
How do you feel
about touring?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.270
- Oh, I would love it.

12:53.206 --> 12:57.010
Like, any relationships
with people or dogs,

12:57.044 --> 12:58.278
or anything like that?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.880
- Nope.
I'm free as a bird.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.281
- Oh. Hmm.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.183
- Great. That's great.
- Fantastic, yeah.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.417
- Okay, yeah.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
- It was great meeting you,
Alannah.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.257
Thanks for this.
We'll be in touch.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.525
- All right, awesome.
Thank you.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.995
Thanks.
- Nice to meet you.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.332
- Asking her if
she has a boyfriend?

13:19.366 --> 13:20.901
- Uh, I asked her
if she had a dog.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.870
- Yeah, right.

13:22.903 --> 13:26.206
- If she'd been a dude, you'd
have done the same thing.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.008
- I can't deny that.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.072
- Did you find everything
you needed?

13:59.106 --> 14:00.240
- I did, yes, sir.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.975
- Good.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.948
Do they last more
than one or two shaves?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.282
I hate it when they
get dull right away.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.651
- Yeah, they do. They last.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.320
- Okay.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.091
- All right. So did you find
everything you need?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.127
- Yes, sir.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.397
- I'm okay.

14:26.599 --> 14:30.037
- So I've been thinking about
what you said before about us.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.172
- Yeah, me too.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.108
Um, I actually wanted to talk
to you about something.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.443
- Okay.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.280
- I talked to
Darius yesterday

14:40.313 --> 14:42.115
and he seems to think that

14:42.149 --> 14:44.051
I'm in a very important
part of my life.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.354
- Well, he says it would be
the perfect time

14:47.387 --> 14:50.390
for me to take on a project.

14:50.423 --> 14:55.162
- Oh. Sounds great.
What kind of project?

14:55.195 --> 14:59.332
- It would less of a project
and more doing service.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.301
Helping other people who've
gone through trauma.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.204
- Oh, I think that would
be wonderful for you.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.607
- Yeah. He thinks that I could
make a huge difference.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.009
- That sounds good.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.981
- The only thing is they
have this outreach program

15:14.014 --> 15:16.149
that's all set up
and everything.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.485
And it's in Bolivia.

15:18.518 --> 15:22.055
- Mm-hmm.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.992
- Yeah.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.560
Well, this would just be
a very short trip until

15:27.594 --> 15:31.331
I figure out whether it's
something I really want to do.

15:31.364 --> 15:35.435
But you would have to stay here
with Cadence, if that's okay.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.337
- Wow.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.706
I don't really know
how I feel about this.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.009
I mean, you got
to think this through.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.278
- I have thought this through.
It's just a quick trip.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.746
- You don't even
know if it's safe.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.648
- I can take care of myself.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.217
I think you know
that by now.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.651
- It's not that.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.020
I just...

15:54.387 --> 15:57.224
I don't trust this guy.

15:57.257 --> 16:00.527
Why are you letting him control
your whole life like this?

16:00.560 --> 16:03.230
- I'm not.
This is my life.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.564
And I'm not letting
him control me.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.766
- Well, do I even get
a say in this?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.269
- Of course.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.739
- All right, then let me
think about it, okay?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.707
- Okay.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.222
- Oh, my God, no.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.590
- I've been calling you.
Listen, listen! Stop!

16:30.623 --> 16:32.292
- I have nothing
to say to you.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.726
- Listen! Listen to me...
- Stop! Don't touch me!

16:33.760 --> 16:35.495
- Look, I know why you're
upset at me.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.030
- Awesome. So do I.
What's going on with Mia?

16:37.064 --> 16:38.165
- Nothing!
You know how I feel about you.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.168
Like were you trying
to hide me from her?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.569
- No! She's crazy!
- Okay, yes she is!

16:42.602 --> 16:43.703
And you're still seeing her!
Jonah?

16:43.736 --> 16:44.804
- We broke up!
- Sure, Jonah.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.439
- Jonah, Jonah!
We gotta go!

16:46.473 --> 16:48.208
- Do this someplace else.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.742
Are you kidding me?

16:49.776 --> 16:53.180
- Get your Hands off!
- Give me your camera!

16:59.486 --> 17:03.123
- * I'm wandering,
and wandering *

17:03.156 --> 17:06.259
* Where this all will lead

17:06.293 --> 17:09.296
* With no more tears to cry

17:09.329 --> 17:12.432
* And no more
blood to bleed *

17:12.465 --> 17:15.635
* I could give in
to this darkness *

17:15.668 --> 17:19.206
* And who knows,
someday I might *

17:19.239 --> 17:22.142
* Till then
I'll keep on walking *

17:22.175 --> 17:26.746
* Keep on looking
for the light *

17:26.779 --> 17:31.684
* Singing ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh *

17:34.221 --> 17:38.425
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

17:41.328 --> 17:44.464
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

17:44.497 --> 17:50.170
* Ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh *

17:59.512 --> 18:00.880
- Thank you.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.854
- MADDIE: Were you trying
to hide me from her?

18:07.887 --> 18:08.888
- JONAH: No, she's crazy.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.625
- This is so messed up.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.267
- No. It wasn't like that.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.536
- Can you give your sister and
I a second, sweetheart?

18:23.570 --> 18:24.837
So we can talk?

18:27.407 --> 18:30.610
Thank you.
- Whatever.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.280
- Yo, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.781
What are you doing?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.918
- Thank you.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.420
- Let me ask you something.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.226
Who is this boy to you?

18:46.259 --> 18:47.527
- I'm not sure
that I know yet.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.162
- Well, look,
I don't know him at all.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.430
He might be a good guy.
Or he might be a bad guy.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.864
I'm not here to judge.
I just...

18:51.898 --> 18:53.566
- But you are judging.
- No, I'm not, no...

18:53.600 --> 18:54.567
- Yes, you are. I can feel it.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.802
- No. I just see what I see.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.803
And I care about you,
baby, so...

18:56.836 --> 18:58.438
- No offense, Dad.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.874
But I've kind of been
through this before.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.776
Honestly, I'm...

19:03.810 --> 19:05.612
I'm more worried
about the fact

19:05.645 --> 19:08.781
that like, sometimes
he's so with me

19:08.815 --> 19:13.220
and then other times,
he's just gone.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.188
- That's got to be hard.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.926
- I really care about him,
you know.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.429
- Yeah.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.796
I guess you're gonna have to
figure out what it is you want.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.598
Here's the part
that worries me, though.

19:25.632 --> 19:29.336
When you get involved with
someone who's that famous,

19:29.369 --> 19:31.671
it's very easy to lose
yourself in their life.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.506
- That's not gonna happen.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.875
- Well, let me ask you how
many songs you written lately?

19:35.908 --> 19:37.510
- That's so not fair.
I've been so busy.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.945
- Well, that's
my point, though.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.513
All that crap right there,
none of it has anything

19:40.547 --> 19:42.415
to do with your music
or you as an artist.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.583
- No, I'm not judging you.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.352
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.519
I'm just saying that
I don't want you to forget

19:46.553 --> 19:48.321
who you are or what you are.

19:48.355 --> 19:52.992
Because what you are,
it's amazing.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.328
- Can we have this
conversation later?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.732
- Yeah.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.200
Lecture over.

20:04.671 --> 20:05.805
Goodnight.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.985
- Uh, hi. Jonah Ford.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.721
- Deacon Claybourne.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.290
- It's an honor
to meet you, sir.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.757
- It's nice to finally
meet you, too.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.659
- I'm sorry for barging in
like this.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.528
Like I told the guard,
I just...

20:28.561 --> 20:30.363
I wanted to speak
to your daughter for a moment.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.398
- That's fine, but I would
like to have a quick word

20:31.431 --> 20:33.766
with you myself first.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.535
It's clear that the two of
you are...

20:35.568 --> 20:40.006
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.541
- So...

20:41.574 --> 20:43.676
- Dad.
- Yep.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.850
- Look, hate me
or don't hate me.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.419
But just hear me out, please?

20:52.452 --> 20:53.920
Okay, first of all,
Mia's delusional.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.655
We broke up weeks ago.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.857
And I'm just as upset about
what she did as you are.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.962
Like anybody can say
what they want about me.

21:02.995 --> 21:06.499
Even if it's a lie, it doesn't
matter as long as it's news.

21:06.533 --> 21:10.503
Maddie, I can handle anything
except you not believing me.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.806
I feel like everything's
just spinning out of control.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.508
Like I have
no control over anything.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.344
- I can't keep doing this!

21:17.377 --> 21:18.611
- Me!

21:18.645 --> 21:20.747
I can't keep up
this whole charade!

21:20.780 --> 21:22.815
- Jonah, you're at the top
of your game right now.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.017
I mean, your tours sell out
a year in advance.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.520
Everybody loves you.
Your music is...

21:27.554 --> 21:29.722
- It's crap!

21:29.756 --> 21:33.593
I can barely leave my house
most days, all right?

21:33.626 --> 21:36.396
I'm so anxious all the time.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.365
I'm always having
to be performing

21:38.398 --> 21:40.367
or I'm pretending to have
the time of my life

21:40.400 --> 21:41.701
on frickin' Instagram.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.970
- Yeah, I get that.
I really do.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.006
- Sometimes I feel like...

21:47.039 --> 21:50.810
Like I'm a freak
in my own life.

21:50.843 --> 21:54.914
- Everybody wants you to be
this person that doesn't exist.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.754
- Look, all I know is
that when I'm with you,

22:01.788 --> 22:03.623
I feel like I'm me.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.792
So when you turn on me,
it scares me.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.560
- I know. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.562
I just...I didn't know
any of this.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.831
- Look, the last thing that
I'm trying to do is hide you.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.801
I need you.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.905
- Yeah.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.740
Come out with me tonight.

22:20.773 --> 22:21.941
It's just a stupid EP rollout.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.410
But it would mean
a lot to me

22:23.443 --> 22:25.077
to have you right
there by my side.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.780
- I actually have
plans tonight...

22:30.983 --> 22:33.653
That I could change.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.458
- Jonah Ford is here!
At our house!

22:38.491 --> 22:39.526
- Yes, he is. I know.
- Right now!

22:39.559 --> 22:40.927
- Okay.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.429
Hey, you give your sister
her privacy, okay?

22:42.462 --> 22:44.497
- I will, obviously.
I'm not a child.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.065
- Okay.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.767
- Also, sleepover's off.
Not happening anymore.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.136
- Right. Wait.
What

22:50.169 --> 22:52.439
What's going on?
- I don't know.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.073
Cassie said her mom
was having a meltdown.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.375
- Okay.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.511
No eavesdropping.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.190
- Hey, It's Jessie.
Leave a message.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.593
- Hi, Jessie.

23:13.626 --> 23:18.164
So Daphne's sleepover
has been canceled.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.099
Which means, I guess,
our night is too.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.901
I'm real sorry.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.708
- Hey, Alannah!

23:28.741 --> 23:30.477
- Hey, it's all of us!

23:30.510 --> 23:32.011
- Hey, guys.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.613
- Well, we're really
sorry to say this.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.815
- Yeah, yeah.
We got some bad news, Alannah.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.049
- Yeah.
Just don't take it too hard.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.485
- But if you're up for it...

23:38.518 --> 23:40.587
- We want you to play with us!

23:40.620 --> 23:44.156
- Well, okay,
I got some bad news too.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.459
I accept.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.594
- Hey! All right!
- All right!

23:47.627 --> 23:48.961
- Well, to further
alarm you,

23:48.995 --> 23:50.563
we have a gig at 12th
and Porter tonight.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.231
- Yeah.
Do you wanna take the plunge?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.200
- I think I can handle it.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.835
I'll fake it till I make it.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.604
- All right then!

23:57.637 --> 23:58.971
- We'll be at Tracks all day
so just come on by.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.674
- Will do and,
hey, thank you, guys.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.710
- All right.
See you soon.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.213
- Hey, Dad...oh, sorry.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.015
- Oh, that's all right.
What's up?

24:09.048 --> 24:10.983
- I just wanted to let you know
the sleepover is happening now.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.721
- Yeah. Her mom's fine.
Just keep writing.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.761
- Dad, my ride's here.

24:54.794 --> 24:57.964
- Okay. Have fun.
- You too. Nice shirt.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.767
- Oh, thank you.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.305
- How are my
two favorite girls?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.974
- Not loving the spaghetti.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.044
- Rehearsal went great.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.646
- Good.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.081
- I am gonna need
to leave a little earlier

25:15.114 --> 25:16.683
for this gig tonight, though.

25:18.651 --> 25:22.088
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.757
We talked about
it this morning.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.225
- I'm sorry. I know.
- You said it was fine.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.760
- I know. I totally spaced.
I'm sorry.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.128
I've had a lot on my mind.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.230
- It's okay. I get it.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.600
- Like this might
not be the best time

25:33.633 --> 25:36.102
but I really want to talk to you
again about the service trip.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.937
I need to give
Darius an answer.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.640
- You know I'm going out
on tour.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.174
I mean, who's gonna
take care of Cadence?

25:42.208 --> 25:44.010
- Well, I'm only going
to be gone for two weeks.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.244
Emily can come and stay
at the house...

25:45.277 --> 25:47.113
- Avery, I need this!

25:47.146 --> 25:51.050
Okay, I need a private life,
one that is just my own!

25:51.083 --> 25:53.119
- I'd settle for any
kind of life right now.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.655
- You know exactly
what it means.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.156
- No, I don't.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.358
- You're completely
obsessed with this group!

25:59.391 --> 26:00.760
It's all you talk
about day and night!

26:02.261 --> 26:04.030
- You're not even here
when you're here!

26:04.063 --> 26:07.033
- Avery, this is the first
time in a long, long time

26:07.066 --> 26:09.001
that I can actually
feel my life!

26:09.035 --> 26:10.302
Do you know what
that means to me?

26:10.336 --> 26:11.904
- Good for you,
but what about me?

26:11.938 --> 26:13.072
Do you feel my life?

26:13.105 --> 26:14.273
- Oh, you're so manipulative!

26:14.306 --> 26:16.042
That is unfair
and you know it!

26:18.010 --> 26:19.812
- I can't believe I'm having
this conversation with you.

26:21.948 --> 26:24.651
Except to save you
from yourself?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.118
- Wow.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.720
I do not need you to save me.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.689
I am saved!

26:41.000 --> 26:42.134
- * Could've been the night

26:42.168 --> 26:43.870
* Could've been the wine

26:43.903 --> 26:46.739
* Could've been her eyes
that got me saying *

26:46.773 --> 26:49.075
- * Do do do do
Do do do do do do *

26:49.108 --> 26:51.410
* Do do do do
Do do do do do do *

26:51.443 --> 26:54.213
- * I took a chance,
shot her a glance *

26:54.246 --> 26:57.249
* Said, baby, let's dance
while the music's playing *

26:57.283 --> 27:00.319
- * Do do do do
Do do do do do do *

27:00.352 --> 27:02.388
* Do do do do
Do do do do do do *

27:02.421 --> 27:06.893
- * Go with it, let's put a
little bit of soul in it *

27:06.926 --> 27:11.931
* I got a feeling that you
and I got something so good *

27:13.399 --> 27:15.802
* Don't stop it

27:15.835 --> 27:18.070
* What I want, girl,
you got it *

27:18.104 --> 27:22.775
* I got a feeling that you
and I got something so good *

27:24.777 --> 27:27.146
* Got, got, got, got
a good thing going *

27:27.179 --> 27:29.916
* Rock steady, get ready,
don't let going *

27:29.949 --> 27:32.384
* Got, got, got, got
a good thing going *

27:32.418 --> 27:36.923
* Keep it rolling,
keep it rolling *

27:39.992 --> 27:41.961
- * The kind that
meets your family *

27:41.994 --> 27:46.132
- Thanks.
We love you, Jonah.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.167
- * The kind that's got
a lot more to her *

27:48.200 --> 27:49.802
* Than just a pretty face

27:52.805 --> 27:54.340
You are so beautiful.

27:56.442 --> 27:59.045
- Jonah's kissing her!

27:59.078 --> 28:00.813
- She's so lucky.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.115
- Jonah's kissing Maddie J!
- I'm so jealous.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.417
- Yeah.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.319
Jonah, I wanted a picture!

28:07.353 --> 28:08.888
- Don't go, Jonah!

28:13.425 --> 28:14.794
- Cold tonight.

28:14.827 --> 28:15.962
- Yeah.
It is a little bit.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.964
- It'd be nice to have a fire.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.334
Have you got any...
- Oh!

28:22.368 --> 28:24.937
Actually, that's not even
a working fireplace.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.840
So I don't even know
why I said that.

28:27.874 --> 28:30.276
I must be very nervous.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.796
I just...
- I think we're...

28:51.998 --> 28:53.866
You go.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.903
- I just can't believe this
is actually happening.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.471
- Neither can I.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.808
- Well, it's not too late
to change your mind.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.542
- Not too late for you either.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.146
I won't change my mind.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.447
- Good.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.049
- I like being here.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.018
- I like being here, too.

29:12.051 --> 29:16.022
- Well, you live here.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.250
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.518
- No. No, it's okay.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.388
- I'm so sorry.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.091
Oh, God.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.294
I'm sorry, Jessie.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.230
- Deacon, stop apologizing,
please.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.232
It's okay.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.067
- Oh, God!

30:35.101 --> 30:37.069
I thought I could.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.972
- It's okay.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.941
- I wanted to.
- I know.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.078
- I gotta get out of here.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.446
- No, no!
Deacon, stop.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.315
It's okay.
Listen, if you...

30:49.348 --> 30:51.650
- It's not okay.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.585
- If you need
to talk about Rayna...

30:53.619 --> 30:55.254
- No.
- It's fine.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.455
- No, it's not fine, Jessie...

30:56.488 --> 30:58.190
- I promise it's okay.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.469
- It's been 11 months.

31:14.473 --> 31:17.977
I can tell you how many weeks
and days, too, if you want.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.312
But there haven't been one of
those days where I haven't...

31:20.346 --> 31:25.151
broken down
in some way or another.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.955
- I understand.

31:28.988 --> 31:32.992
- The girls seem to be
doing better, you know.

31:33.025 --> 31:36.428
I mean, I think...

31:38.464 --> 31:41.200
That just means
I need to...

31:41.233 --> 31:44.436
- Deacon, you cannot keep
this locked up inside of you.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.177
- I just don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.085
- Look at me.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.452
That's okay.

32:13.665 --> 32:18.270
- * Everything's changed

32:18.304 --> 32:23.109
* Nothing's the same

32:23.142 --> 32:26.478
* Maybe it's the sign
of the times *

32:26.512 --> 32:28.047
* Everywhere I turn

32:28.080 --> 32:34.020
* It's the blind
leading the blind *

32:34.053 --> 32:38.424
* We make tears fall

32:38.457 --> 32:44.096
* We let rivers rise

32:44.130 --> 32:47.199
* You just gotta hold on

32:47.233 --> 32:51.303
* I'm not leaving
you behind *

32:55.407 --> 33:00.512
- * Hold on, hold on

33:00.546 --> 33:05.251
* I'm not leaving you behind

33:06.618 --> 33:11.457
* Hold on, hold on

33:11.490 --> 33:16.095
* I'm not leaving
you behind *

33:19.265 --> 33:20.732
- You know, it's funny.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.402
I don't usually like
to think about growing up.

33:23.435 --> 33:24.636
My dad and I didn't
get along too good.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.405
- Yeah.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.540
I mostly just tried to stay
the hell out of his way.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.412
- Yeah.

33:33.445 --> 33:37.349
He'd hit me.
A lot actually.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.817
It's funny,
when you're a kid,

33:38.850 --> 33:41.320
part of you thinks
it's normal, you know.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.488
- Yeah.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.157
- Most of you
knows it's not.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.193
Really, the hard part
was never knowing

33:47.226 --> 33:49.261
what he was gonna be like
when he came home at night.

33:49.295 --> 33:50.796
- That's scary.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.432
- Yeah, it could be.

33:53.465 --> 33:57.603
But mostly, I just wanted
to be with him really.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.172
I mean, I didn't even
care what we did.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.507
Just sort of hang out.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.643
Do whatever it is
fathers and sons do.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.746
- Yeah, that's what a boy
needs from his father,

34:07.779 --> 34:09.615
you know, to be a rock.

34:09.648 --> 34:12.118
Loved, no matter what.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.453
- I know that's what you
worry about with Jake.

34:14.486 --> 34:18.557
- Yes, I do.

34:18.590 --> 34:22.494
- You know, I always secretly
wished I'd had a son.

34:24.196 --> 34:27.199
- Yeah. See what that
feeling was like.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.734
- Yeah.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.675
- Excuse me.

34:36.708 --> 34:40.479
You have been digging
and that is not allowed.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.416
- You ate all
the almond brittle!

34:44.450 --> 34:45.851
- Well, that's
the good part.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.687
What did you want me to do?
- You are so bad.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.556
- Could I get
that whole rack right there?

34:50.589 --> 34:52.491
And then I want the glazed.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.194
And then the chocolate
with bacon?

34:55.227 --> 34:56.895
- Yes.
- And the sprinkles, of course.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.197
- Of course, yes.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.531
- Great! Great!

34:59.565 --> 35:01.267
Bacon rainbow sprinkles
for everyone!

35:01.300 --> 35:02.501
- Yay!

35:02.534 --> 35:05.304
- Thanks, Jonah!
- You're welcome.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.643
- This is so nice.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.445
- Well, you do have
a pretty nice floor.

35:17.683 --> 35:18.884
- When I was a little girl,

35:18.917 --> 35:22.188
I used to count
the stars before bed.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.390
It was the only way
I could fall asleep.

35:26.925 --> 35:32.198
- Be nice if we could sleep
outside together sometime.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.432
- Yeah.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.169
Maybe by a river?

35:41.773 --> 35:43.342
- Yeah.

35:45.911 --> 35:49.681
- We could count
the stars together.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.664
- Oh, Jessie.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.369
I'm so sorry.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.838
I'm afraid I might
be broken somehow.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.833
- Hey, baby.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.806
- Sorry I'm not
a normal person.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.709
You deserve a normal person
in your life.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.645
- It's okay.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.715
I'm used to you...sort of.

36:58.950 --> 37:04.290
- You're wrong.
I do need you.

37:04.323 --> 37:07.225
I need you more than
anybody in the world.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.502
- I'm awake.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.039
- How come your eyes
are still closed?

37:54.072 --> 37:57.576
- Because I'm tired.
What time is it?

37:57.609 --> 38:00.546
- Oh, gosh, almost six.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.590
- No.
I mean, I wasn't.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.826
But, yeah, I am now.
I think I should go.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.496
- Yeah. Sure.
You should.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.876
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.110
- I'll call you.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.412
- Yeah.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.353
- Listen, Jessie,
about last night...

38:41.387 --> 38:42.488
I don't want you
to think that...

38:42.521 --> 38:43.955
- You don't have
to say anything.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.691
I know that Rayna is a
hell of an act to follow.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.726
- That's definitely not
what I was gonna say at all.

38:47.759 --> 38:48.794
- Look, I get it.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.462
You know, moving on is

38:50.496 --> 38:53.399
actually highly
overrated, really.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.100
- Jessie...

38:55.133 --> 38:58.737
- But just so you know,
I know that I'm not her.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.440
And I'm never even gonna
remotely be her.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.808
- Jessie...
- She was larger than life.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.009
And I can't compete with that.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.145
- That's not what
I was gonna say.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.914
I was gonna say that
last night,

39:08.947 --> 39:11.783
I felt close to you.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.051
That's something
I never thought

39:13.084 --> 39:15.454
I was ever gonna
feel again, ever.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.090
And I know I'm damaged...
- Right.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.759
So you're gonna say
you don't deserve me?

39:20.792 --> 39:22.528
Because if that's what
you're gonna say,

39:22.561 --> 39:24.029
please just walk out the door
and don't come back.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.632
- I was gonna say...

39:26.665 --> 39:28.634
Please don't give up on me.

39:35.173 --> 39:36.808
Oh.

39:38.510 --> 39:39.711
Okay, then.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.816
- Come here.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.162
- Thank you.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.171
- Morning.
- Morning.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.811
- Yeah, I did.
Did you?

40:12.844 --> 40:16.047
- Yeah. I did.

40:18.684 --> 40:22.220
- Yeah...

40:23.254 --> 40:24.690
- I live here.

40:24.723 --> 40:25.891
What happened?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.158
- Cassie got food poisoning.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.960
Thank God I didn't
eat the chicken.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.863
Anyways, her parents ended up
taking her to Urgent Care.

40:31.897 --> 40:35.133
So they dropped us all off.
Where were you guys?

40:35.166 --> 40:38.537
- Uh, well, your
sister was with...

40:38.570 --> 40:40.038
- Jonah.
- Jonah.

40:40.071 --> 40:46.712
Me, I was...well, Jessie and
I were visiting earlier.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.113
Well, we decided...

40:50.782 --> 40:52.518
- Look what I got.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.452
- Mm, doughnuts, yeah.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.783
Juliette?

41:45.871 --> 41:47.739
- JULIETTE:
Hey, it's Juliette.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.074
Leave a message and
I'll call you back.
