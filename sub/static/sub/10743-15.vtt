               Uh, Jeannie?

00:05.672 --> 00:07.939
Good morning, master.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.107
          Good morning, Jeannie.

00:09.109 --> 00:10.408
         Oh...

00:10.410 --> 00:13.145
     I cannot imagine
    why I'm so sleepy.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.613
                   I can.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.015
   You exhausted yourself making
      that dinner last night.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.083
Ah, did you enjoy it?

00:19.085 --> 00:22.120
    It was one of the best meals
       I ever had in my life.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.488
                  What was it?

00:23.490 --> 00:25.190
    We had caviar and champagne,
        Mm-hm.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.825
          uh, duck a l'orange...
  Mm-hm. Pomme soufflé.

00:27.827 --> 00:30.228
    Pomme soufflé, that's right,
      and, uh, for desert, uh--

00:30.230 --> 00:31.463
                 Crepes Suzette.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.265
Crepes Suzette, oh,
they were wonderful.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.932
You know, it'd take me
   a month's salary

00:34.934 --> 00:36.268
to pay for a meal
   like that.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.735
                    Ah...
Jeannie, before you came,

00:37.737 --> 00:39.571
my food bills used
to be ridiculous.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.574
Now, take the market bill
I got this morning for example.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.209
  In the old days,
it would have been...

00:44.211 --> 00:46.044
 Oh, I don't know,
around 100 dollars,

00:46.046 --> 00:49.080
and now it's only
 $1047 and 63...

00:49.082 --> 00:51.883
One thousand dollars?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.585
                Oh, yes, master.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.087
     That is for the banquets
  you have been having all week.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.690
But I-I thought you just,
       you know...

00:58.692 --> 01:00.192
                Well, sometimes.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.694
         But usually I just shop
           at the corner grocer

01:02.696 --> 01:04.529
               where you have
            your charge account.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.598
        Well, there is a little
       Persian market I know of,

01:06.600 --> 01:08.266
              but the meat there
                is very tough.

01:08.268 --> 01:10.902
   Why didn't you
tell me this before?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.672
       About the Persian market?
      Well, I didn't think you--

01:13.674 --> 01:15.073
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.342
I don't think you realize
what you've done, Jeannie.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.411
You see, Roger was gonna
come over and pick me up,

01:19.413 --> 01:21.213
and we were gonna go down
   and buy a sailboat

01:21.215 --> 01:22.814
  that we'd had
our eyes on, but--

01:22.816 --> 01:24.516
Well, now, I just
can't afford it.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.585
              Well how much is
           the sailboat, master?

01:26.587 --> 01:29.721
Well, it's 1000 dollars
  more than I've got.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.298
You went out and bought
 the boat without me.

Why didn't you wait
      for me?

02:47.467 --> 02:48.966

    because this is not my boat.

this over on approval?

  they will cut off your ears.

 until he failed to repay a loan

     before he became earless.

         of this loan?

     That's heartbreaking.

                  70 dollars,

  machine and take in sewing.

 without first-class security.

   That's what I'm here for.

  and all that sort of thing.
     How much is this boat?

09:49.923 --> 09:53.324
It's $3200, but I'm buying it
with a friend of mine,

09:53.326 --> 09:55.159
       so it'll
only be $1600 a piece.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.560
  WILFRED:
Is that all?

09:56.562 --> 09:59.797
   Think of all the hours of
pleasure you can have for $1600.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.733
Well, I have thought about it,

10:01.735 --> 10:04.235
and that's the reason I wanna
 discuss taking out a loan.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.570
  I'm $1000 short.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.538

        Yes.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.913
       None.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.882
I have a house, but it's got
     a mortgage on it.

10:17.884 --> 10:20.151
  But you do have securities.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.586
        No.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.688
   No wonder you want a boat.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.223
You want to escape from poverty.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.958
   Well, I do have
 a bank account here.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.259
  Well, why didn't you say so?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.794

 to strangers,

 to one of our big depositors.

a big depositor, I--

10:37.837 --> 10:39.436

       in your accounts?

10:39.438 --> 10:40.704

    Yes. Oh, I think
I have about $600 in it.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.645
      Six hundred dollars?

10:48.682 --> 10:50.281

          a thousand?

be any trouble with the loan.

  Perhaps you could talk to him
and persuade him to borrow more.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.932
       I'll talk to him,
           all right.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.233
                     Thank you,
                    Dr. Bellows.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.702
           It's going
       to be my pleasure.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.304
           Excuse me.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.407
 I got the loan without
losing my ears, didn't I?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.775
                Hm. Yes, master.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.676
  And I got the loan
  without your help.

15:12.678 --> 15:15.746
           Y-yes, master.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.881
  You know, I've been thinking
      of buying a new car.

15:17.883 --> 15:20.384
    Uh, maybe I'll negotiate
      another little loan.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.886
 I do not think I would do that
     if I were you, master.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.423
 Mm... Hm? I know how
to handle these people

15:25.425 --> 15:26.824
    much better
than you do, really.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.792
        [DOORBELL RINGS]
I think that's Roger.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.629
               Oh...

15:31.631 --> 15:33.764
         Oh, Jeannie, I wish
        you wouldn't do that.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.766
  Oh, I'm sorry, Major Healey.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.969
 Jeannie, next time you let him
 walk up the flight of stairs.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.871
What happened at the bank?
      Get your loan?

15:40.873 --> 15:42.573
   Oh, there's nothing to it.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.242
They couldn't do enough for me.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.243
Really? I've been trying
 to borrow money there

15:46.245 --> 15:47.377
       for two years.

15:47.379 --> 15:48.980
   Well, next time you go in,

15:48.982 --> 15:51.082
       just mention, uh,
 that you're a friend of mine.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.449
   ROGER:
That's funny.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.918
  We make the same amount
         of money.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.887
Boy, you must have something
     that I don't have.

15:55.889 --> 16:00.090
  Oh, Major Nelson is very good
       at handling people.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.894
  Yeah, hey, look, let's go over
   and pick out our boat, okay?

       the loveliest boat

16:05.364 --> 16:07.732
           I ever saw
     was Cleopatra's barge.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.933
      No kidding. Really?

16:08.935 --> 16:10.735
             ROGER:
  I'd love to have seen that.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.638
Well, we better get going.
I'll see you tonight, Jeannie.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.940
             Okay.
     And, uh, no blinking.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.742

    Wow! Look
at that spinnaker.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.122

Yeah, it's also $5000.

      Roge, we've only got 3200.

      I'm ready
to go sailing, master.

         Hi.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.964
               We don't have
          the boat yet, Jeannie.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.299

           That's a cute outfit.
             Yeah.

Do you like it?
                        Yeah.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.007
            Jeannie!

16:50.009 --> 16:51.943
               You look darling.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.477
       Major Nelson, I...

16:53.479 --> 16:54.946
              Well, I'll see you
                 later, Tony.

16:54.948 --> 16:58.316
   Stay right where you are,
         Major Healey.

16:58.318 --> 17:02.253
Major, what do you think
  you're dressed for?

17:02.255 --> 17:04.088
            Uh, this is, uh--

17:04.089 --> 17:05.589
    Well, it's for sailing, sir.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.491
           The sailing number

                  Oh, that show.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.164
                    You talkin'.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.166
You're rehearsing for
a Christmas show in August?

17:16.169 --> 17:18.169
            Yeah, well,
      these things take time.

17:18.171 --> 17:22.240
Hm. Has anyone left you
a large sum of money recently?

17:22.242 --> 17:23.574
              No, sir.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.041
   Good.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.644
Major Nelson, I want you to wait
right here, do you understand?

17:27.646 --> 17:29.513
 Right here.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.317
      Oh, quick thinking.
          "What show?"

17:33.319 --> 17:34.585
         Oh, very good.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.453
                      Jeannie!

17:36.455 --> 17:38.356
                  Oh, nice work.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.291
I am sorry, master,
  but in Greece,

17:40.293 --> 17:41.492
the warriors wore skirts,

17:41.494 --> 17:43.594
and in Scotland, the men
wear kilts all the time--

17:43.596 --> 17:46.063
  Yeah, but this is Cocoa Beach,
   and Dr. Bellows, well, uh...

17:47.833 --> 17:50.601
   Why did he ask me if I'd been
     left a large sum of money?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.371
He's wearing a sweater
     and a skirt

17:53.373 --> 17:56.007
  and has $3,000,000
in his Christmas fund?

17:56.009 --> 17:57.608
          That's right, general.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.410
   Doctor, have you
been analyzed recently?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.744
                   Oh, general.

18:00.746 --> 18:04.282
         This time, Major Nelson
         won't get away with it.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.683
            His money is in
      the Cocoa Beach City Bank,

18:06.685 --> 18:08.185
         and he's in his office.

18:08.187 --> 18:11.588
Dr. Bellows, if this is another
one of your wild hallucinations,

18:11.590 --> 18:14.491
you're going through
psychoanalysis again.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.660
                      Gladly.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.229
That's good.
                        Hm.

18:18.231 --> 18:22.233
   While we were at the bank,
you didn't do anything, did you?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.700
            Do what?

18:23.702 --> 18:25.469
Well, if I knew,
I wouldn't be asking you.

18:25.471 --> 18:28.339
Why would anybody
wanna lend me $200,000?

18:28.341 --> 18:31.475
            You mean they wanted
           to lend you $200,000,

18:31.477 --> 18:32.543
       and you didn't accept it?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.511
Jeannie, what did
you do at the bank?

18:34.513 --> 18:36.780
        I-if I tell you,
 you will not be angry with me?

18:36.782 --> 18:38.715
Me, angry? Me?

18:38.717 --> 18:40.551
Why would I get angry?

18:40.553 --> 18:42.519

18:42.521 --> 18:45.289
Who are you talking to,
Major Nelson?

   Oh, uh, we were
just rehearsing, sir.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.360
You know, the Christmas play?

18:49.362 --> 18:51.695
  You-- You've got
the next line, Roge.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.029
                  My line next?

18:53.031 --> 18:55.098
                  Oh, goodbye.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.400
Just a moment, major.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.604
             You said he was
         in a skirt and sweater.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.240
Well, obviously
he changed clothes, general.

19:03.242 --> 19:07.177
I can't wait to hear him explain
away the money in his account.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.347
Oh, oh, is that all--?

19:09.349 --> 19:11.482

     Is that all
you're worried about?

19:13.253 --> 19:14.452
  Well?

19:16.189 --> 19:18.822
Oh, yes. Well, I started
the account last January,

19:18.824 --> 19:21.225
and every week I stick a certain
amount of money in there,

19:21.227 --> 19:23.027
and it all adds up, you know.

19:23.029 --> 19:26.864
To $3,000,614?

Three million, six hundred...

19:29.101 --> 19:31.869

And this time you can't blame it
on any Christmas play.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.171
The money is in
the bank, and it's yours.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.606
Now, would you like
to explain it now?

19:36.608 --> 19:38.943
Or at your court-martial, major?

19:38.945 --> 19:41.511
Well, I-- I can't
explain it, sir.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.280
I don't have $3,000,000.

19:43.282 --> 19:44.849
The bank says you do.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.516
   Well, there's only one way
          to find out.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.886
  We'll all go down there
         right now.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.822

20:03.702 --> 20:05.135
Yes, Mr. Melnick?

            This is Mr. Peterfy,
            the federal auditor.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.438
How do you do,
 Mr. Peterfy?

20:08.440 --> 20:10.474
             Mr. Peterfy wants
          to ask you a question.

          Always delighted
        to answer questions.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.211
Mr. Melnick tells us
   that you said

20:14.213 --> 20:16.514
that one of your savings club
depositors had an account

20:16.516 --> 20:18.149
containing $3,000,000.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.051
        Yes, Major Nelson.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.553
        I made him a loan
    this morning, personally.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.990
Mr. Wilfred, if Major Nelson
has $3,000,000 in his account,

20:25.992 --> 20:28.659
this bank is $3,000,000 short.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.996

That is correct.

We've tracked it down
 to your department.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.369
      I'm sure you don't think
            that I-I-I--

20:38.371 --> 20:40.571
           I mean to say,
    you don't suspect that I...

20:40.573 --> 20:41.905
        But I didn't take it.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.241
 That money is in Major Nelson's
        Christmas account.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.212
          Here it is.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.719
                Six hundred
           and fourteen dollars.

20:54.721 --> 20:55.753
  What?

20:55.755 --> 20:58.255
   B-but I saw it here myself.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.590
With management like this,

20:59.592 --> 21:02.559
I think I shall have to audit
your books from top to bottom.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.863
 A three million dollar mistake.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.798
                That must be
           a new world's record.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.801
      There's Mr. Wilfred.
        He'll tell you.

Oh, Mr. Wilfred?

21:12.138 --> 21:14.071
   This is General Peterson.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.839
      And you know Major Nelson.

21:15.841 --> 21:16.907
I certainly do.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.342
                Mr. Wilfred,
           I want to talk to you

21:18.344 --> 21:20.144
            about Major Nelson's
             Christmas account.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.312
        Do you really?

21:21.314 --> 21:23.314
      Will you please tell
          the general

21:23.316 --> 21:26.216
     how much Major Nelson
      has in that account?

21:26.218 --> 21:27.785
        I'd be delighted.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.053
          He's got $614.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.822
    BELLOWS:
That's a mistake.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.158
       I'm talking about
    Major Nelson's account.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.360
I don't know what you're trying
     to pull, Dr. Bellows.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.729
    But swindling a bank is
       a federal offense.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.764
            Me? Swindler?

21:40.766 --> 21:43.734
             You told me
          he had $3,000,000.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.503
     Yeah, well, he hasn't.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.004
  And about that loan, major,

21:47.006 --> 21:49.306
you better come up
with some security.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.175
 This isn't the Salvation Army,
           you know.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.343
       Doctor.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.511
          No, sir.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.813
  This time I'm not going
       to back down.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.414
Somewhere in this bank
    is $3,000,000

21:57.416 --> 22:01.585
belonging to Major Nelson, and I
demand to know where he got it.

22:05.858 --> 22:09.493
Doctor, I think I found
   that $3,000,000.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.028
         Good. I knew it.
   Let me have it as evidence.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.464
            May I see that, sir?

22:13.466 --> 22:16.367
              Well, Dr. Bellows,
              this is your card.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.803
      Mine? That's impossible.

22:28.047 --> 22:31.282
     I can start my analysis
         in the morning.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.424
      Jeannie?

22:40.426 --> 22:42.459
               Jeannie?

22:44.930 --> 22:48.031
 Jeannie, it's all right,
    you can come out.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.701
         Are you sure you are
      not angry with me, master?

22:50.703 --> 22:53.236
Millionaires don't get angry,
          Jeannie.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.171
           I'm sorry about that.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.373
           But I was only trying

22:56.375 --> 22:57.975
                to be helpful.
Trying to be helpful.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.376
Yeah, I know.
              Yes, master.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.211
   I must say,
it was kind of fun

23:01.213 --> 23:03.413
thinking I had $3,000,000
in the bank.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.749
 That's all right,
I'm perfectly happy

23:05.751 --> 23:07.417
with things the way they are.

23:07.419 --> 23:08.952
              Yes, master.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.621
                           Hi.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.422
          Well, how's my friend,
             the millionaire?

23:12.424 --> 23:13.557
I'm fine, Roge.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.925
               Hey, did you hear
                 what happened

23:14.927 --> 23:16.459
            to poor Dr. Bellows?
Yeah, yeah.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.428
Well, at least one nice thing
came out of this.

23:18.430 --> 23:21.431
That poor widow will be able
to buy a sewing machine now.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.367
 Oh, I do not think she's going
      to need one, master.

23:24.369 --> 23:25.869
Why not?

23:25.871 --> 23:28.572
 I believe she has a beautiful,
 little dress shop of her own.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.373
Oh, that's wonderful,
Jeannie.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.075
               You can buy
         all your clothes there.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.044
That's funny.
Oh, you're funny.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.278
              I kind of like you
                  in skirts.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.947
             Are we gonna buy
         the boat, or aren't we?

23:36.949 --> 23:38.048
We're gonna have to wait.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.650
I had to give the loan
back to the bank.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.051
         That is terrible.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.687
       I will take that bank
         and tear it apart!

23:43.689 --> 23:44.988
No, don't do anything.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.924
They're in business
to make money.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.559
That's their business.

23:48.561 --> 23:51.194
I doubt if Mr. Wilfred
has ever been at sea.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.697
      He looks like he's never
    been out of the bank before.

23:53.699 --> 23:58.001
Boy, if he could feel
the rolling deck of a ship

23:58.003 --> 24:01.572
beneath his feet and feel the
wind and the spray on his face,

24:01.574 --> 24:04.340
he'd maybe know
what he was missing.

24:04.342 --> 24:07.911
     I do not think he is ready
       for that yet, master.

24:07.913 --> 24:11.048
Maybe we ought to start
him off on a raft.

       Jeannie! Jeannie!

24:17.823 --> 24:19.022
               ROGER:
            Get us off!
