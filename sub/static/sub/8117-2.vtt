WEBVTT

00:23.291 --> 00:24.992
You eat at mess last night?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.394
Man, oh man.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.229
Chef put out a slab
of meat, I swear

00:28.262 --> 00:29.597
it was bright orange.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.831
Watch out!

00:30.864 --> 00:32.500
Hang on.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.040
Terra Nova, this is
Lieutenant Hikuda.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.376
We're at Marker 24 Alpha.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.646
Gillers here got us
a pretty nasty flat tire.

00:45.679 --> 00:50.218
Copy that. Compliments
to chauffeur Gillers.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.028
- Terra Nova out.
- I don't even know what I hit.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.921
Just fix the tire, Gill.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.356
We've got a long drive,

00:55.389 --> 00:57.749
and Outpost Three's expecting
these supplies in the morning.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.971
What was that?!

01:11.004 --> 01:12.573
What was what?

01:14.041 --> 01:16.344
Sir, in the trees.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.862
When night falls and
you have no weapons,

01:34.895 --> 01:37.598
fire is the only thing
these creatures understand.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.568
Your survival
depends on this.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.271
Good.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.105
If you're lost in the jungle,

01:45.139 --> 01:47.875
and you have to find
your way out,

01:47.908 --> 01:50.311
which way is north?

01:54.148 --> 01:58.186
Lieutenant Washington
asked a question.

01:58.752 --> 01:59.687
Yeah.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.889
That way. And you know this how?

02:01.922 --> 02:04.057
The moss on that tree.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.194
Gold star, Shannon.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.631
These here are beetle grubs.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.234
They are edible
and they are nutritious.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.436
Ew.
Ew?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.471
You find yourself low on
provisions and starving,

02:17.505 --> 02:18.839
you won't be saying "ew."

02:18.872 --> 02:20.508
You'll be saying...

02:27.781 --> 02:31.685
All right, people,
we resume survival training

02:31.719 --> 02:32.920
tomorrow at 0800.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.688
Do not be late.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.257
Dismissed.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.361
Shannon, remember the
construction crews

02:40.394 --> 02:41.529
on the north side?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.207
They've got some latrines
that need de-mucking.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.733
Yes, ma'am, I know.
Then hustle.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.402
Yeah, maybe next time
you'll think twice

02:48.436 --> 02:51.639
before you steal a rover and
almost get yourself killed.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.846
Mommy, can I have this one?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.047
Yeah, sure, honey.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.049
I don't see why not.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.918
Okay, let's find
a nice pot for that.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.689
Look, Daddy, it has a mouth.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.923
Yeah.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.128
Maybe we shouldn't
do that again.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.864
Can I take it to my room?

03:16.897 --> 03:18.932
Yeah, just don't let
it bite your nose off.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.934
I won't.

03:25.506 --> 03:30.278
It's funny... I know it's yellow,
but it is an unusual hue.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.945
That's because it's
a natural pigment,

03:31.979 --> 03:34.715
and the plant it's made from
doesn't exist in 2149.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.084
Kind of like crimson before
the Spanish brought it back

03:37.117 --> 03:38.452
in the 1500s.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.489
No one in Europe had
ever seen it before.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.791
It is amazing how you keep
all that stuff in your head.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.859
Well, have you seen it?
It's huge.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.729
Get off. You know, Mom and
Dad don't like talking about it,

03:48.762 --> 03:51.465
but they were worried it might
not make it through the portal.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.267
Don't touch me. You reek.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.970
No, Josh.
Go take a shower. No.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.809
But I want to sleep in your
bed. I know you do, sweetheart,

04:01.842 --> 04:03.544
but here's the thing,
Daddy's home now.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.779
That's where he and I
are supposed to sleep.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.781
Come on. You've got
your own bed now.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.917
Hey, Zoe, I'll be
right here beside you,

04:09.950 --> 04:11.495
and we can keep this
light on if you want.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.921
Yeah? Come on, you're
a big girl now. Come on.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.823
Night-night.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.757
Good night.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.195
What was that?

04:55.228 --> 04:58.632
Well, I mean, who
knows around here?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.874
Jim.
What?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.442
Please...

05:09.743 --> 05:12.045
All right, all right. Okay.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.382
Okay.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.052
I'll be right back.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.454
I'll be here.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.529
Hey, scat!

05:28.562 --> 05:30.998
Get out of here!

05:31.031 --> 05:32.099
Go on.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.035
Scat!

05:38.839 --> 05:40.408
Okay.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.413
I think I scared him off.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.350
She needed a cuddle. Sorry.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.722
Good morning,
Commander Taylor.

05:54.755 --> 05:59.627
You wanted to see me? We lost contact
with a supply run out by Outpost Three.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.129
They last checked in at Marker
26 Alpha on the north rim.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.631
Sixers?
Could be.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.066
We've had skirmishes with
them out that way before.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.535
They're getting bolder.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.737
Man, I'd like to get a line
on where they're hiding out

06:09.770 --> 06:11.605
and hit them for a change.
In time, Wash.

06:11.639 --> 06:14.241
I want to move out ASAP.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.976
Shannon, grab us a medic
just in case.

06:16.009 --> 06:16.910
Let's mount up.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.246
Could you start an I.V.
for me here please?

06:19.279 --> 06:21.549
Nurse, can you have a look
at my colleague here's arm?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.116
I think it might
be infected.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.218
Malcolm?

06:25.252 --> 06:27.855
Elisabeth?

06:27.888 --> 06:30.023
Malcolm...
My God, when did you...?

06:30.057 --> 06:32.025
I just got here
on the Tenth Pilgrimage.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.462
Eighth, I came on
the Eighth. I'm, uh...

06:34.495 --> 06:35.929
I'm chief science officer here.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.731
My God, what are the chances?

06:37.765 --> 06:39.567
I know, right? Talk
about a small world.

06:39.600 --> 06:44.237
Well, yeah, that, and well,
85 million years.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.373
I can't believe
it's really you.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.841
Oh, you look well.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.677
You look great.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.212
Listen, I just got in from
a few days in the field.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.182
What do you say we get
together later and catch up?

06:55.215 --> 06:57.184
Elisabeth.
Jim, hi.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.586
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.821
Who can I see about getting
a medic for a ride-along?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.832
Oh, well, I can help you with
that. But listen, you're never

07:02.856 --> 07:04.601
going to believe this.
This is Malcolm Wallace.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.994
We were at university together.
You're joking.

07:07.027 --> 07:07.861
Wow, that's incredible.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.797
Malcolm, this is Jim my husband.

07:09.830 --> 07:13.300
Yeah, right. I heard somewhere
you were, uh, married.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.202
Uh, need that medic.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.270
Yeah, I'll sort that for you.
Just give me a sec.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.872
So good to see you.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.874
Bye.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.611
Well, um, it's
a pleasure.

07:35.623 --> 07:38.726
One thing I know for sure
about Sixers...

07:38.759 --> 07:41.895
They tried to put a bullet
in your head the other day.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.498
Not the first time,
won't be the last.

07:44.532 --> 07:48.235
Which is why I'd appreciate it
if you'd hang back a step.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.940
Shucks, you might
make me blush.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.746
Any idea why
they want you dead?

07:58.779 --> 08:03.751
Well, I try not to take
things too personal, Shannon.

08:03.784 --> 08:07.821
The way I figure it,
everybody's got their reasons.

08:07.855 --> 08:11.324
And seeing as how you are so
interested in the Sixers,

08:11.358 --> 08:13.060
you might do me a favor.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.127
What's that?

08:14.161 --> 08:17.264
Mira's got somebody
inside Terra Nova.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.766
I need to know who.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.500
Somebody's been
feeding her intel.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.836
You sound pretty
sure about that.

08:22.870 --> 08:28.508
Oh, yeah, tracking our patrols,
know when we run our supplies.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.410
Somebody's tipping
her off.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.413
I can't figure out
who it is, though.

08:33.446 --> 08:37.017
But I'm just a soldier.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.719
You're a lawman.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.688
I figure you might have
a nose for this kind of thing.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.358
- Commander.
- Yeah?

08:45.392 --> 08:47.527
Cover this bank.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.650
I've got another
one over here.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.966
What the hell
did this to them?

09:25.999 --> 09:28.368
I don't know.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.738
But it wasn't Sixers.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.684
How can you be hungry after
cleaning out toilets all morning?

09:43.717 --> 09:45.786
Cast iron stomach, I guess.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.387
Oh, xiph-kabobs.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.489
What-kabobs?

09:49.522 --> 09:52.893
Xiphactinus...
It's a fish.

09:52.926 --> 09:57.064
It's pretty ugly,
but it's so good.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.398
Two, please.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.967
Coming right up.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.551
You play pretty good.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.921
You know, it's yours
for just 65 terras.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.757
Um, sorry.
I don't have any money.

10:23.791 --> 10:24.725
I just got here.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.260
Well, in that case,
I'll make it 60.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.764
And I'll throw in this pick,

10:30.798 --> 10:35.969
which I painstakingly carved
from a Carno's tooth.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.842
And no, it's not the Carno that
did me this little favor.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.847
Is 60 terras a lot?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.281
Uh, yeah, kind of.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.619
It's really amazing, but I need
to earn some cash first.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.554
Tell ya,
don't think too long.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.858
Things move fast
around here.

10:57.891 --> 10:58.792
All right, thanks.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.828
Okay.
It's really cool.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.002
I'm gonna need a few hours
to do a complete postmortem,

11:09.036 --> 11:10.938
but at first glance,
I can tell you this.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.081
These men were attacked
from above.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.075
I mean, all their wounds are
to the face and to the neck.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.877
I'm thinking
tree-darters.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.812
Those snakes will drop
on you by the dozen.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.414
I've never seen them
do anything like this.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.916
Not to three armed men.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.593
Yeah, they must have stumbled
onto a nest or something,

11:24.617 --> 11:25.652
got taken
by surprise.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.022
Do tree-darters have, uh, claws?

11:29.056 --> 11:30.824
Sorry?

11:30.858 --> 11:33.894
Do they have...?

11:33.927 --> 11:37.898
Reptiliachordata,
there's... no, no claws.

11:37.931 --> 11:42.970
I'm just wondering
what this is about, is all.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.538
Looks like a claw or
a talon or something.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.242
Let me see.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.444
So it does.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.954
Malcolm,

12:00.988 --> 12:02.422
I need to know

12:02.455 --> 12:04.457
what did this, today.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.159
Elisabeth, we're gonna

12:06.193 --> 12:07.961
need to run a bite
mark analysis.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.330
Okay, looks like I'm gonna be
here for a while tonight.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.431
Do you think you can

12:11.464 --> 12:13.767
wrangle the kids?

12:13.801 --> 12:14.868
Oh, yeah. Sure.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.469
There's leftovers
in the steri-bin.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.704
Make sure Zoe takes her bath.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.273
Got it.
Josh does his homework.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.341
Will do.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.142
And, um, don't let Maddy

12:22.175 --> 12:23.610
forget to put her retainer in.

12:23.643 --> 12:26.446
She wears a retainer?

12:31.785 --> 12:33.854
Dinner, homework,
retainer, bath.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.256
Daddy, can I feed
my plant a bug now?

12:36.289 --> 12:37.524
Not now, sweetie.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.992
Dinner, homework...

12:39.793 --> 12:40.693
Dad?

12:40.727 --> 12:42.796
I said not now!

12:42.830 --> 12:44.564
I'm-I'm sorry, Maddy.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.734
Could I ask
you something?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.302
Yeah, yeah, go on.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.440
How do you know
if a boy likes you?

12:53.473 --> 12:54.842
You can't.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.409
He doesn't.
What boy?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.477
You're only 16.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.411
You know what,
never mind.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.213
Uh, do you want me
to start on dinner? Yeah?

13:00.247 --> 13:01.247
Yes.
Okay.

13:02.983 --> 13:06.086
Welcome back to the family, Dad.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.655
Yeah.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.265
Hey.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.368
Hey.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.670
Hey.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.505
How'd everything go
this evening?

13:25.538 --> 13:26.840
Smooth sailing all the way.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.142
Yeah? Zoe have a bath?

13:30.677 --> 13:33.513
You mean a bath with soap
and water and all that?

13:33.546 --> 13:34.982
Jim.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.685
So what's this?

13:38.718 --> 13:40.387
Some kind of wine?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.389
It's 85 million B.C.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.823
Very good year.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.661
So, did anything new

13:48.695 --> 13:51.264
turn up from
the autopsy?

13:51.298 --> 13:55.435
The wounds don't match any known
species on the database.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.904
Neither does the claw.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.872
It looks like we're
dealing with a predator

13:58.906 --> 14:00.640
no one's ever seen before
in this region.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.674
That's a
scary thought.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.742
Did you tell Taylor?

14:02.775 --> 14:04.111
Yeah, yeah,
Malcolm filled him in.

14:05.712 --> 14:06.880
I still can't get over that.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.449
I mean, what are the chances
of running into him?

14:09.482 --> 14:10.984
Yeah.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.819
Well, you both did go
to that fancy college,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.654
and they do recruit
from the best here.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.489
Still, the odds.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.729
Did you, um...

14:22.762 --> 14:26.866
Did you and he,
uh, ever...

14:26.900 --> 14:28.969
Date?

14:29.002 --> 14:31.138
Are you asking me
if we ever dated?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.009
Maybe, for half a minute.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.744
I knew it.
Jim!

14:37.777 --> 14:38.979
I could just tell.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.580
Stop! It was ages ago.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.614
Yeah, for half
a minute.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.150
Oh, what, are you jealous?

14:46.619 --> 14:47.654
No.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.525
So did you break it off
or did he?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.427
I thought you said
you weren't jealous.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.495
I'm just curious.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.098
Well, what difference
does it make who broke it off?

14:59.732 --> 15:00.700
It was you,
wasn't it?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.702
Oh, don't even try those
little cop tricks on me.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.704
Huh? So it was him.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.773
Can I go, please, Officer?

15:06.806 --> 15:10.978
I have to put our daughter
in the bath and then to bed.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.413
You may go.

15:15.815 --> 15:19.086
Just don't leave town.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.752
Unbelievable.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.954
I-I don't...

15:56.723 --> 15:59.026
Man, that
thing's loud.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.631
You got to be kidding me.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.434
Get!

16:07.467 --> 16:08.501
Go on! Go!

16:09.769 --> 16:11.138
Scat!

16:12.739 --> 16:14.941
Hey! Get out!

16:14.974 --> 16:15.974
Hey.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.681
Get in the house.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.150
Get in the house!

16:48.475 --> 16:52.545
I think we just found out
what killed those men.

17:02.822 --> 17:06.292
Well, it certainly
looks like the same bite mark.

17:11.263 --> 17:14.000
These birds were
about yea high...

17:14.032 --> 17:16.103
They're not birds,
Mr. Shannon.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.270
Reptiles.

17:17.304 --> 17:21.007
Whatever. They were jet black
with white markings.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.709
Beaks about this long.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.477
Mean little bastards.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.846
Doesn't sound like any species
of Pterosaur

17:26.878 --> 17:28.781
I've ever come across.

17:28.815 --> 17:32.152
Yeah, well... three of
my men came across them.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.920
I had to bury them this morning.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.555
So my question to you is:

17:35.588 --> 17:37.890
Just how am I supposed
to handle these things?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.959
There's a
general rule:

17:39.992 --> 17:42.362
Smaller animals don't attack
larger ones unless provoked.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.407
With all due respect to the men
who died, the likelihood is

17:44.431 --> 17:46.065
they somehow disturbed
these Pterosaurs

17:46.099 --> 17:48.501
and brought this
tragedy on themselves.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.213
What about the ones who attacked
Shannon and his son?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.771
Happened right here
in Terra Nova.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.249
Well, they were probably
scavenging for food

17:53.273 --> 17:55.342
and got confused
by the lights.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.111
What we need to do is a get a
science team on this right away

17:58.145 --> 18:00.022
so that we can observe
these animals and draw up

18:00.046 --> 18:01.814
an interaction protocol
so people know

18:01.848 --> 18:03.950
how to behave
around them.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.018
No protocols today, Malcolm.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.654
Until I know
what these things are

18:07.687 --> 18:10.490
and why they're
attacking my people,

18:10.523 --> 18:13.025
nobody leaves the compound,
all work details

18:13.059 --> 18:15.562
in as soon as possible,
as of right now.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.496
You got it.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.831
Sir, we have research teams
in the field...

18:18.865 --> 18:20.333
That's enough!

18:22.101 --> 18:24.937
We'll research another day.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.373
No discussion here.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.018
Good man.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.520
Pain in my ass sometimes.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.423
Always trying to push
his own way, you know?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.456
Yeah.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.327
Can I ask you something?

18:48.561 --> 18:51.664
What's the recruitment process
in Terra Nova?

18:51.698 --> 18:52.532
All personnel requests

18:52.565 --> 18:55.902
come to me
through the department heads.

18:55.935 --> 18:59.439
Most of the time,
they're looking for a resume,

18:59.472 --> 19:02.074
but once in a while, they'll
make a specific recommendation,

19:02.108 --> 19:05.778
somebody that they know
and value in 2149.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.914
Why? You looking to recruit

19:07.947 --> 19:09.816
a deputy or something?

19:09.849 --> 19:10.983
No.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.520
I was just curious
about my wife.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.322
She was at the top
of a very short list.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.357
Matter of fact,
list was submitted to me

19:17.390 --> 19:19.692
by the aforementioned
Malcolm Wallace.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.231
Well, I guess
I should thank him.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.617
Exquisite, isn't it?

19:44.651 --> 19:48.555
Just discovered
it last week.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.623
An ancestor of Phalaenopsis
Aphrodite, I suspect.

19:50.657 --> 19:54.261
Well, its medicinal applications
look very promising.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.462
I'm telling
you, Elisabeth,

19:55.495 --> 19:58.064
that jungle out there
is a treasure trove.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.599
For all we know,
there could be

19:59.632 --> 20:03.035
a cure for cancer just
waiting to be found.

20:03.069 --> 20:06.473
There's still hope
for humanity yet.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.808
Remember when you
said that to me?

20:08.841 --> 20:09.976
No.

20:10.009 --> 20:14.213
It was the night before you
left to start medical school.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.359
Remember I was saying something
about how I didn't understand

20:16.383 --> 20:17.760
how people could want
to have children,

20:17.784 --> 20:22.655
that it was irresponsible to
bring them into a dying world.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.025
And you said

20:26.058 --> 20:28.094
you'd never give
up believing

20:28.127 --> 20:29.829
that things might
one day get better.

20:29.862 --> 20:33.099
We'd come too far
for them to just end.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.335
"There's still hope
for humanity yet."

20:35.368 --> 20:37.036
Well, always the "optimist,"
I guess.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.008
Yes.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.278
It's funny,
years later,

20:45.312 --> 20:47.146
when they first discovered
the time fracture

20:47.179 --> 20:48.681
and decided
to colonize this place,

20:48.715 --> 20:52.352
I remember watching the news
and thinking...

20:52.385 --> 20:55.988
maybe Elisabeth was
right after all.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.926
Maybe there is still hope.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.561
So, from then on,

21:01.594 --> 21:05.798
I made it my mission
to get myself here.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.067
And here you are.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.002
And here you are.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.941
Well...

21:14.974 --> 21:16.876
I know you were
brought here as a doctor,

21:16.909 --> 21:20.813
but I also know how passionate
you are about research.

21:20.847 --> 21:24.384
And you're gonna get the chance
to do a whole lot of both.

21:36.696 --> 21:40.199
You're back for another peek
at that magnificent guitar.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.535
I'm told you might be
willing to trade.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.804
Well, that depends.

21:44.837 --> 21:45.972
What do you got?

21:46.005 --> 21:48.107
All right, this is
the latest from Oblivion,

21:48.140 --> 21:49.576
Rainbow Ash
and Future Shock.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.444
Who?
They're bands.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.379
You know, music?

21:52.412 --> 21:53.312
Hey, I'm Second
Pilgrimage.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.914
It's all just noise to me.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.182
What else you got?

21:56.215 --> 21:57.016
Okay, how about this?

21:57.049 --> 21:59.118
This was actually worn
by Jackie Hayes.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.420
He was shortstop
for Chicago

22:00.453 --> 22:01.788
year they won
the World Series.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.256
Well, you know,
I'm a Boston man myself,

22:04.290 --> 22:06.125
but I do know a
guy in munitions

22:06.158 --> 22:07.293
who might be interested.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.195
What about that necklace?

22:09.228 --> 22:10.196
That looks real nice.

22:10.229 --> 22:11.798
What is that,
silver or platinum?

22:11.831 --> 22:14.367
Uh, yeah, it's platinum,
but it's not for sale.

22:14.401 --> 22:17.370
I'm talking trade here. Look, it
was a present from someone,

22:17.404 --> 22:19.171
and it's not going
to happen, all right?

22:19.205 --> 22:20.245
Do you want
the cap or not?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.611
Don't think so.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.319
It was from her, wasn't it?

22:33.352 --> 22:34.521
What?

22:34.554 --> 22:35.922
Your necklace.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.591
It was from the girl
you left behind?

22:43.630 --> 22:45.965
Her name was Kara.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.070
You really miss her, don't you?

22:55.942 --> 22:58.110
What was she like?

23:03.015 --> 23:04.951
I don't know.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.654
Just, uh, really smart.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.791
She was really funny.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.726
But she had a tough side, too.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.130
She was kind of like you.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.637
Anyway, we were
in this band together.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.205
It was no big deal.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.008
We were all right, I guess.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.111
We had a sloppy bass player,
but...

23:32.144 --> 23:33.880
Shame to break up the band.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.015
Yeah.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.377
Those birds
are exactly like the ones

23:55.401 --> 23:57.003
that attacked me
and my dad last night.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.170
Oh, my God.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.106
Let's go. Come on.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.015
Skye!

24:09.048 --> 24:10.717
Skye!

24:43.783 --> 24:46.252
They were just like the ones
from last night, Dad,

24:46.285 --> 24:47.620
but there were
hundreds of them,

24:47.654 --> 24:49.164
and they just kept on
swooping down at us.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.190
Even after the guards
turned the sonics on them.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.959
I-I don't know what
finally drove them off.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.127
They just kind of flew off
all at once.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.797
We got 36 wounded,
three seriously,

24:57.830 --> 24:59.542
but I'm told they'll survive,
and no fatalities.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.734
Well, we got lucky
this time.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.703
Tell the tower to keep
their eye on the sky.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.337
Tell them to goose
the frequency

25:05.371 --> 25:06.839
on the sonics as well.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.908
Go have your mom take a
look at those wounds.

25:08.941 --> 25:12.211
Go ahead.
She's right there.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.259
Where are those
interaction protocols

25:27.293 --> 25:28.961
when you need them, huh?

25:30.897 --> 25:33.566
I think I may have an idea
what's going on here.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.067
It's no accident
that we haven't seen

25:35.101 --> 25:36.669
this species
in the region before,

25:36.703 --> 25:38.437
because they're not
from this region.

25:38.470 --> 25:41.073
They're migrating.
Great.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.609
Let's hope they
keep on migrating

25:42.642 --> 25:44.110
and get the hell out of here.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.111
You're not
following.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.288
Migrations, particularly
if they're not

25:46.312 --> 25:48.447
annual migrations...
And we know this one isn't

25:48.480 --> 25:49.982
'cause we haven't
seen them before...

25:50.016 --> 25:53.119
Tend to be population-wide,
sometimes even species-wide.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.621
Meaning what?

25:54.654 --> 25:56.222
Meaning...

25:56.255 --> 25:58.758
that what we've seen today
is just the first wave.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.996
There are a lot more coming.

26:13.105 --> 26:16.042
Go to Aerial-Cam Three,
North Perimeter.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.746
We have research balloons
taking atmospheric readings.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.648
Now punch us in.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.284
I can't see a
damn thing.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.253
Canopy's too thick.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.855
Go thermal.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.259
There.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.061
Under the canopy.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.697
Probably resting
in the branches.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.332
There's millions of them.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.734
At least.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.511
Either that or something's wrong
with the infrared.

26:43.535 --> 26:44.771
It could just
be ghosting.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.039
Well, let's see.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.676
Fire a sonic blast
into the trees.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.957
Well, that's
not good.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.593
Okay, let's say you're right
and they're migrating.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.229
Why?

27:10.262 --> 27:12.699
Well, species migrate
for a variety of reasons.

27:12.732 --> 27:13.700
Change in climate,

27:13.733 --> 27:16.335
influx of predators, to mate.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.840
What is it?

27:20.873 --> 27:23.475
Few years back, we were digging
for the geothermal well.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.377
You remember that.
Yeah.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.079
We went about ten feet down.

27:27.113 --> 27:30.750
We found fragments... thousands
and thousands of them.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.184
Thousands of what?

27:32.218 --> 27:35.087
Eggshells.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.422
But we didn't think much

27:36.455 --> 27:37.690
of it at the time.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.425
I mean, it was deep enough
that we figured

27:39.458 --> 27:41.961
whatever had laid them
had long since moved on.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.330
Actually, one of the
reasons we built here

27:44.363 --> 27:48.067
is because they made
the soil so fertile.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.102
All right,
so if what you're saying

27:50.136 --> 27:52.939
is these things
were born here,

27:52.972 --> 27:55.842
that means they're coming back
to spawn.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.845
That's why they're attacking.

27:58.878 --> 28:02.414
We built Terra Nova
on their breeding ground.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.495
Wash, as soon as
the marketplace is clear,

28:16.528 --> 28:18.164
I want everyone indoors.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.165
No panic.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.667
Make sure every building
is secure... the houses,

28:21.700 --> 28:23.936
the school,
even the damn bar.

28:30.743 --> 28:31.577
Anything?

28:31.610 --> 28:32.745
DNA was a match.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.146
We typed the
specimen I recovered

28:34.180 --> 28:35.848
against the shell
fragments we dug up.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.283
Same species.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.426
Well, there must be
something we can do

28:38.450 --> 28:39.551
to keep these things away.

28:39.585 --> 28:40.686
Well, maybe there is,

28:40.719 --> 28:41.797
but to really understand
their physiology

28:41.821 --> 28:43.389
and find a way
to repel them,

28:43.422 --> 28:44.857
we'd need a live specimen.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.926
Two, preferably... male
and female if possible.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.061
So if we come up
with a couple of specimens,

28:49.095 --> 28:51.630
you can figure out a way
we can fight these things?

28:51.663 --> 28:52.674
Yeah, but the faster,
the better.

28:52.698 --> 28:53.909
At their current rate
of migration,

28:53.933 --> 28:56.568
the pterosaurs will be here
by nightfall tomorrow.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.337
You want to do
some hunting tonight?

28:58.370 --> 28:59.906
Point the way.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.249
Okay, you're going
to need a clean shot,

29:01.273 --> 29:03.575
so your best bet is to target
one away from the others.

29:03.609 --> 29:04.643
Aim for the underbelly.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.178
Yep, you told me that already.

29:06.212 --> 29:09.081
The males will more likely be
decorative and colorful.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.183
Bolder markings. Right.

29:11.217 --> 29:15.354
You, uh... you weren't expecting
to see me here, were you?

29:15.387 --> 29:17.223
The fe... the females

29:17.256 --> 29:18.224
have-have-have...
have shorter...

29:18.257 --> 29:19.691
You thought
I was still in jail.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.193
And just aim for
the underbelly...

29:21.227 --> 29:24.997
Don't pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about, Malcolm.

29:25.031 --> 29:28.634
I saw your face when
you realized who I was.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.369
What are you implying?

29:30.402 --> 29:31.437
You recruited her.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.605
You recruited my wife,
and when you saw her,

29:33.639 --> 29:35.274
you pretended
to be all surprised.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.675
That's ridiculous.

29:36.708 --> 29:37.853
Yeah, you thought
you'd get her here,

29:37.877 --> 29:39.378
act like it was all
a big coincidence,

29:39.411 --> 29:41.447
and then... and have
another shot with her.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.448
Listen, I recruited her

29:42.481 --> 29:44.884
because she was the best person
for the job.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.253
Hope I'm wrong about you,
Malcolm.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.654
I really do.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.489
Ready to roll,
Shannon.

29:50.522 --> 29:51.323
Should be exciting.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.492
You sure you don't want
to come along?

29:54.793 --> 29:57.063
Yeah, I didn't think so.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.481
We brought back two specimens

30:15.514 --> 30:17.516
and took them
to the research lab.

30:17.549 --> 30:18.384
And the colony?

30:18.417 --> 30:19.651
Well, water systems

30:19.685 --> 30:21.653
are sealed and netted,
same with the energy grids.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.456
We've got an armed man
on every civilian domicile.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.557
So far, so good.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.327
So what do you think...
How long can we last?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.396
If we're lucky,
maybe the night.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.764
Please tell me that
our test subjects

30:32.798 --> 30:34.533
turned something up.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.303
Pheromones.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.139
I was hoping for something
a little more lethal, Doctor.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.041
We don't have a way to
repel these creatures,

30:42.074 --> 30:44.010
but we might have a
way to attract them.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.278
And that would be
a good thing why?

30:46.312 --> 30:48.390
Well, this is what regulates
their spawning instincts.

30:48.414 --> 30:49.557
If we synthesize
a concentrated,

30:49.581 --> 30:52.184
more powerful version
of their pheromones,

30:52.218 --> 30:54.954
we might be able to lure them
to another location.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.455
Establish a new
breeding ground

30:56.488 --> 30:57.957
away from Terra Nova.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.426
Well, how long will that take?

31:00.459 --> 31:02.494
A couple of hours
to get the solution right,

31:02.528 --> 31:04.563
and then we'll need
to find a way

31:04.596 --> 31:05.932
of dispersing the pheromones.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.366
Leave that to me.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.301
Shannon, you prep
a transport.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.971
Wash, I want confirmation
that this place is locked down.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.540
I mean sealed tight.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.943
Let's get to work.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.512
You stay inside and listen

31:20.546 --> 31:21.813
to Private Jenkins, okay?

31:21.847 --> 31:23.449
I'll be fine.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.151
There's a soldier
in every house.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.585
I know, but I want you here.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.622
Uh, to help out
with my sisters.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.559
Under no circumstances

31:33.592 --> 31:36.162
open a door or a window.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.496
Don't worry about us.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.564
Okay.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.498
Be all right.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.533
Okay.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.634
Let's go.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.311
What happened
to Jenkins?

31:52.344 --> 31:53.845
Little mix-up
in the duty roster.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.982
You mind if I
double-check the windows?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.650
Be my guest.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.589
That's how you know
a boy likes you.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.126
Maddy, close
the door.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.413
Okay?

32:58.277 --> 33:00.179
Invictolide levels
are dropping again.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.581
Damn, these pheromone
molecules are unstable.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.616
Let's try an
alpha-helical membrane,

33:04.650 --> 33:06.385
see if we can combine then.

33:06.418 --> 33:09.355
Sterile fertilizer drum.
I can jerry-rig it.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.757
This thing'll hold 50 liters,
is that going to be enough?

33:11.790 --> 33:13.225
It's gonna have to be.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.137
At this rate, we won't have
time to synthesize much more

33:15.161 --> 33:17.363
pheromone than that.
Hopefully, it'll be enough

33:17.396 --> 33:18.564
to lure these creatures away.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.799
Transport's charged
and standing by.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.968
How's it coming here?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.370
Not quick enough.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.272
Have you checked on the kids?

33:26.305 --> 33:29.741
Radioed Reynolds a few minutes
ago. Everyone's safe.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.412
You know, uh,

33:33.445 --> 33:36.048
I don't mean to rush you, but
those critters are doing some

33:36.082 --> 33:38.226
major damage out there. We
understand the pressures at hand.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.552
Just, please, stay back
and let us do our jobs.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.788
Things will get done
a lot more quickly.

34:02.641 --> 34:03.909
Are we going to be okay?

34:03.942 --> 34:06.245
Of course we are, Z.

34:10.616 --> 34:11.882
Hey, you know what?

34:11.917 --> 34:13.552
Bet you 60 terras
we don't make it.

34:13.585 --> 34:14.686
What?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.588
60 terras!

34:16.621 --> 34:18.757
Of course we're
going to make it.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.393
That's a lame-ass bet.
If you win, you can't collect.

34:22.428 --> 34:25.764
No, but if you do, at least
you could buy that guitar.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.735
Hey.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.339
You hear that?

34:33.371 --> 34:34.806
Yeah.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.879
Androsterone levels
are stable.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.781
Copulin attractants?

34:44.716 --> 34:46.351
Looking good.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.487
Our little molecules
are finally bonding.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.722
Yes, they are,
aren't they?

34:53.725 --> 34:56.762
Ah! That's it.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.096
We've got it!

34:58.130 --> 35:00.166
You sure about that?

35:00.199 --> 35:01.376
Yeah, I mean, we wouldn't
want to rush you.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.635
Yes, send them to
the chem-assembler.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.407
I want Mummy and Daddy.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.442
I know you do, I know,
but you're not the only one

35:10.476 --> 35:12.344
that's scared, and we
gotta be brave, okay?

35:34.366 --> 35:35.901
Maddy, behind you!

35:37.603 --> 35:38.504
Hey!

35:38.537 --> 35:40.606
Get into Maddy's room right now!

35:50.616 --> 35:51.783
Where's Zoe?

36:09.201 --> 36:10.869
Zoe, stay there
until I get you.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.239
Josh! Get back!

36:18.176 --> 36:19.711
Reynolds, this is Jim Shannon.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.214
We're getting ready to head out.
Is everything all right?

36:22.248 --> 36:23.982
Get out of there,
you little bastards!

36:24.015 --> 36:24.983
Reynolds?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.952
- Come in!
- Daddy.

36:26.985 --> 36:27.986
Is everything okay?

36:52.010 --> 36:54.045
Zoe. Come on.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.647
Oh, come on!

37:03.755 --> 37:04.756
It's all right.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.092
Dad, this is Josh.
Can you hear me?

37:07.125 --> 37:08.794
Yeah, Josh, I'm here.
What's going on?

37:08.827 --> 37:12.063
Is everything okay?
Jim, we're out of here.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.140
Yeah, everything's
fine, we're okay.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.100
Yeah, we're heading out.
Hey, Josh...

37:15.133 --> 37:17.336
take good care of
your sisters, okay?

37:17.369 --> 37:18.504
You got it.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.839
All right.
Switch it on.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.812
We're good to go!

37:26.845 --> 37:28.647
All right, all right.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.191
Come on, you miserable
sons of bitches.

37:30.215 --> 37:31.283
Come on!

37:31.317 --> 37:33.452
Come on! Follow me!

38:01.813 --> 38:03.549
Malcolm.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.183
What?

38:05.216 --> 38:07.386
Listen.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.383
It worked.
Yeah.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.892
I guess I owe you 60 terras.

38:46.925 --> 38:47.993
Yeah. Right.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.160
No, seriously.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.162
I want you to have it.

38:51.196 --> 38:53.399
You can pay me back later.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.168
Thanks.

38:57.202 --> 39:00.706
I better go check
on my housemates.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.040
Yeah.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.943
Yeah. Well, see you.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.906
Here they come!

40:04.002 --> 40:05.270
Hey, Wash.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.739
You all right?

40:07.773 --> 40:09.675
Never better.
What happened?

40:09.708 --> 40:12.243
Things got a little exciting
after Triple Junction.

40:12.277 --> 40:13.879
We got to the valley, we...

40:13.912 --> 40:17.348
well, we jettisoned the drum,
and we high-tailed it home.

40:17.382 --> 40:18.484
That's about it, isn't it?

40:18.517 --> 40:19.894
Watched the swarm come
in from the ridge.

40:19.918 --> 40:23.254
Near as we could tell, they took
to the place like it was home.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.990
There.
I'm all... thanks.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.024
All right.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.358
Everything all right
around here?

40:27.392 --> 40:29.260
Just some jangled nerves.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.562
Now, if you think

40:30.596 --> 40:32.306
that they're noisy when
they're coming at you,

40:32.330 --> 40:33.832
you wouldn't believe the racket

40:33.865 --> 40:36.101
they make when they start...

40:37.536 --> 40:39.838
So it's all good now,
but sooner or later,

40:39.871 --> 40:41.516
there's going to be hatchlings
by the millions.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.641
What happens then?

40:42.674 --> 40:45.310
Well, from what we can
tell from their biology,

40:45.343 --> 40:46.778
they'll migrate
to the coastline,

40:46.812 --> 40:48.680
and that's where they'll
grow to full maturity.

40:48.714 --> 40:52.551
And then, nine years from now,
Malcolmus pterosauria

40:52.584 --> 40:54.920
will migrate to its
new sporting ground.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.993
Well... every new
species needs a name,

41:02.027 --> 41:04.195
and I... I did help
discover them.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.397
I mean...

41:06.431 --> 41:09.568
Well, it's been
a hell of night, huh?

41:09.601 --> 41:12.538
I'm going to get some shut-eye.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.578
Well, sweet dreams.

41:19.611 --> 41:22.480
Malcolmus.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.399
Do you remember when
they were really small,

41:41.432 --> 41:44.903
and we could just scoop them up
and carry them off to bed?

41:44.936 --> 41:46.705
Yeah.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.207
Well, I guess we're
all pretty tired.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.213
I'm not that tired.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.916
Well, I guess we should start
fixing this place up.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.818
I mean, there's
a lot of damage...

41:59.851 --> 42:01.186
Jim.
