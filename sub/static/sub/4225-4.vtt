00:02.000 --> 00:05.686
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.924
From now on, Mr Shelby,
you shut your gypsy mouth

00:09.000 --> 00:10.923
and listen to your instructions.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.767
<i>I know it was you who carried
out the murder of Mr Duggan.</i>

00:15.000 --> 00:19.642
--You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.806
- Name?
-Harold Hancox.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.008
- Have you ever been arrested?
-No.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.923
Arthur, we can stand him up.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.250
<i>Last night, one of our men had
his throat cut in Winston Green.</i>

00:30.320 --> 00:31.845
I'm not real!

00:31.920 --> 00:35.970
Gentlemen? This is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.520
- I want to go with them.
-Over my dead body.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.921
Do we hear 800 guineas? 850.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.731
<i>May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.</i>

00:43.800 --> 00:46.485
- So will you consider me?
-I will consider you.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.330
Thomas Shelby?

00:51.920 --> 00:53.524
<i>Did they behave themselves?</i>

00:53.800 --> 00:56.167
They were really amazing.

00:59.800 --> 02:09.787
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

02:46.760 --> 02:50.207
You might think this is a curious
place for me to suggest a meeting,

02:50.840 --> 02:52.808
but...

02:52.880 --> 02:55.486
your surprises have only just begun.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.690
You look a little unsteady, Mr Shelby.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.050
Take a seat.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.760
You're working together.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.011
Blowing up the Garrison was your idea.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.004
You chose me.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.003
It's funny, I thought the
Fenians had a policy...

03:33.080 --> 03:34.809
- Enough.
-Eh? Of not mixing

03:34.960 --> 03:36.086
the personal with the political.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.366
- I said enough.
-I think

03:37.440 --> 03:39.010
I will decide on what is enough.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.651
Who's in charge here then, eh?
Who's in charge?

03:41.920 --> 03:44.241
Right, let me understand this.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.085
- You answer to an agent of the Crown.
- Perhaps we can just...

03:47.160 --> 03:50.050
- Very interesting.
-Perhaps we can stick to the agenda.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.566
- Whose agenda?
-There is a form of words here.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.529
- Whose words?
-Arrogant bastard.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.963
I'm not accustomed
to being spoken to like that.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.206
just come to order.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.567
I am here to listen,
but not to the fucking infantry.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.881
Enough! Jesus!

04:03.960 --> 04:05.405
Now...

04:07.520 --> 04:11.161
Some weeks ago, Mr Shelby
carried out a military mission

04:11.240 --> 04:15.131
on behalf of pro-treaty Republicans
here in Birmingham.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.440
You...

04:16.519 --> 04:18.329
Working for the King.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.721
- There is a unique political situation.
-Yea h? How does that feel?

04:22.280 --> 04:24.328
- Let us...
-Tell me. How does that fucking feel?

04:24.400 --> 04:25.686
...stick to the form of words.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.081
- Temporarily, we have a shared interest.
-Oh, I see.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.322
- Shall we just stop him laughing?
-You want me to stop laughing?

04:31.560 --> 04:32.891
Explain this, pal.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.208
Following the success of your mission...

04:35.320 --> 04:37.766
- We're going to make you do it again.
-Will you shut up?

04:37.840 --> 04:40.207
Can we just conduct
ourselves here, please?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.805
- Conduct ourselves!
-Please.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.521
No one in this room wants to breathe
the same air as anyone else.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.965
- Nevertheless...
-Nevertheless the pro-treaty Paddies

04:51.040 --> 04:53.088
and the King want the same man dead.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.450
Am I right?

05:18.800 --> 05:21.610
- Why him?
-Did you ask why in France?

05:22.520 --> 05:26.889
- Yeah.
-So, it's the same answer, because.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.251
Why me?

05:36.200 --> 05:38.521
- Because.
-Because.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.289
Because if anybody connects me to this,

05:43.400 --> 05:45.846
it will be assumed
that it was a criminal act

05:45.960 --> 05:47.769
and not a political one.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.447
No, you need not fear being
connected to the killing

05:51.520 --> 05:54.888
because I will see to it that
no connection is ever made.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.364
You will have complete
immunity after the fact.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.766
But, in the execution, you will get
no help from agents of the Crown.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.565
And we can't be seen to be involved.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.730
You have been chosen, Mr Shelby,

06:10.240 --> 06:11.810
and there really is no choice.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.367
No equals bang,

06:14.440 --> 06:17.205
and your man here will shed no tears
as he looks the other way.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.730
Nevertheless...

06:25.520 --> 06:26.806
I say no.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.607
Mr Shelby?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.209
What about your export licence,
Mr Shelby?

06:44.280 --> 06:46.726
You had a deal with Mr Churchill.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.244
The one with the mouth,
Donal Henry, he is a spy.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.211
He is working for the Irregulars
against the pro-treaty Paddies.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.527
He reports every fucking
word back to them.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.806
No, it's not possible.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.645
They've both been security vetted
by my own department.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.087
I have men in places your men can't go.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.044
Donal Henry meets the
anti-treaty Paddies in the back room

07:10.160 --> 07:13.528
of the Mother Red Cap in Saltley,
sometimes twice a week.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.451
These Irish enemies are
fucking brothers and cousins.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.364
You are stepping into a world
you don't understand.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.846
If what you're saying is true,
he'll be dealt with.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.482
Bring me proof the spy is dead
and we have a deal.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.601
Mr Shelby.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.404
- Billy boy.
-Watch it.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.169
Now on you go.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.724
Right. boys, let's go!

09:31.320 --> 09:33.163
Fuck you!

09:33.240 --> 09:35.083
Mario!

09:36.360 --> 09:38.169
Mario!

09:45.320 --> 09:47.687
Mario!

09:47.760 --> 09:49.489
Come here.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.206
Sabini's day is done.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.564
I'll protect you now.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.724
Oh, shut up!

10:04.120 --> 10:06.361
Stop fucking whingeing.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.408
Due to my razor blade,

10:11.480 --> 10:14.563
and a few complaints from the neighbours

10:14.640 --> 10:17.450
about the terrible fucking music...

10:22.520 --> 10:25.729
Do you want to tell them or should I?

10:25.800 --> 10:29.361
This place is under new management.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.089
<i>By order of the Peaky Blinders.</i>

12:25.680 --> 12:27.045
Yes?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.970
Somebody to see you, Mr Shelby.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.883
He says he's come about the
position of accounts clerk.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.644
Send him in.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.491
- just through here, sir.
- Thank you.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.965
Michael...

12:48.160 --> 12:49.764
Vacancy's been filled.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.642
Not according to this morning's paper.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.122
At school, I was top of the
class in mathematics,

13:05.240 --> 13:08.210
and I did a night school course in
accountancy at Worcester College.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.564
Mum says you've had
six different accountant clerks

13:12.640 --> 13:13.971
in the last six months.

13:16.200 --> 13:20.000
When respectable men see the
other things you do, they leave.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.207
But I, like Lizzie out there,
already know what you do.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.208
Mum says you want to be 80% legal
within two years.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.521
- Three.
-I can help.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.767
I know both sides and
you know you can trust me.

13:40.080 --> 13:44.449
I want to help you, Tommy, become legal.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.289
Do the right thing.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.810
I want to be proud of this family.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.130
Does Polly know you're here, Michael?

14:05.440 --> 14:07.204
I'm 18 on Friday, I go where I please.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.404
You phone your mother.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.004
Good luck.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.127
We're not open for winnings yet.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.129
I'm here to see Thomas Shelby.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.248
I have an appointment.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.970
Come in.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.520
- May Carleton.
- Mr Shelby has his proper meetings

15:07.600 --> 15:09.568
in his other office.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.850
This was the address that he gave me.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.605
- He gave you this address?
-He said it was a gambling den.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.564
I told him that I'd wanted to see one

15:19.640 --> 15:21.369
since I'm always reading
about them in the papers.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.844
Quite the big scandal
in The Telegraph lately.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.890
Anyway, he said that
I could come and have a look.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.371
And now I feel like a bit of an idiot

15:32.440 --> 15:34.568
because I'm early and he's late
and I have no idea how to behave.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.525
In a gambling den?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.526
I'll wait in the car.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.080
If I open the door again,
they'll all want to come in.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.204
Like flies.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.006
So what are you?

15:54.080 --> 15:55.809
What am I?

15:55.880 --> 15:57.370
To Thomas?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.447
I'm going to train his racehorse...
For Epsom.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.005
You know horses?

16:06.320 --> 16:08.891
Yes. You?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.246
Born riding.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.405
I slept in a manger when I was a baby.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.889
I was born riding, too.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.291
There's a fucking
great Riley parked out there

16:24.360 --> 16:25.646
and nobody's watching it.

16:25.720 --> 16:29.805
John, this woman says
she's training Thomas' horse.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.969
He's told us a lot about you.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.650
Don't know where he is, do you?

16:42.720 --> 16:45.166
Sorry I'm late.
There was a family matter.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.049
Esme, keep it locked up for a minute.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.766
- Yes, Thomas.
-I'll show you around.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.929
So, be my guest.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.202
That's my brother Arthur's office.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.728
Down there is my brother John's office,

17:19.800 --> 17:22.406
that's where we slate
the runners and the riders.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.369
It's so out in the open.
What about the police?

17:29.680 --> 17:31.170
What about them?

17:33.360 --> 17:36.443
When I drove into Small Heath,
I thought I was going to get murdered...

17:36.680 --> 17:38.682
Then I mentioned your name.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.328
It was like being escorted
to see a king.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.365
- You came here to get my girl, right?
-Right.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.530
She looks in very good condition,

18:05.600 --> 18:07.921
considering she's not been
out on the gallops.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.009
Curly's the best horseman in England.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.651
I have a man called Mickey
who'd argue the point.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.200
Ah, Curly here is half horse himself.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.442
She's blessed. Very blessed.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.409
Well, she's from the best stock.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.922
But I'd rather have a coloured pony.
Mixed blood is stronger.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.210
Not to win the Derby, Curly.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.328
Don't like them racing, Tommy,
not the way they beat them.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.531
- She's all yours.
-Thank you.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.849
He gets sad when one leaves.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.848
- What time is your box van coming?
-Midday.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.810
Maybe you've got time to take
the lady to the Garrison,

18:41.880 --> 18:43.689
show her the spa and the tearooms.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.003
I'd like that, why not?

18:54.520 --> 18:58.047
I just had it done up.
There was a fire.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.645
It's...

18:59.720 --> 19:02.166
Yeah.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.730
What do you drink?

19:04.960 --> 19:06.724
So early, but gin.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.130
Goodness. With something?

19:27.920 --> 19:29.524
Like what?

19:30.960 --> 19:32.485
Tonic water or...

19:34.200 --> 19:37.568
Erm... We have, erm...

19:37.720 --> 19:39.006
Cordial.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.085
There's not much room in there but...

19:53.560 --> 19:55.403
You want to fuck me, Mrs Carleton?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.889
Perhaps because I...

20:00.400 --> 20:03.085
Perhaps because I would represent
something to you?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.487
We should have this conversation
before the booze

20:08.360 --> 20:10.010
starts talking for us.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.571
You have a horse.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.609
Yes, I have a horse.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.720
The horse is why I'm here.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.405
Purely that.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.209
And because you're paying me a
lot of money to train your horse,

20:28.280 --> 20:29.770
that's why I'm here.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.646
Purely that.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.284
Good.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.163
Good. Well, a toast, then.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.849
To the horse, to the Derby.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.809
- Cheers.
-Cheers.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.042
So is that what you say to women?

20:59.240 --> 21:00.924
Only if I don't know what they want.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.768
And what if they don't want to fuck?

21:05.240 --> 21:07.322
Then life is simpler.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.970
You want a simple life?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.765
Do I look like a man
who wants a simple life, eh?

21:17.120 --> 21:18.565
So what do you want?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.731
For what I'm paying you, Mrs Carleton,

21:23.920 --> 21:27.845
I want a horse that'll pay out
at Epsom on an each-way bet.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.690
Before I took your account,

21:37.200 --> 21:38.645
I did some credit checks on you.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.365
Apparently, you don't exist.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.842
My existence is questionable.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.443
Gypsies don't like registers.

21:56.800 --> 22:00.725
You see, I'm not gypsy like you mean.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.723
But you did register for France.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.682
I also sent your name to the War Office,

22:07.280 --> 22:09.521
I have friends there.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.841
You won two medals for gallantry.

22:14.120 --> 22:17.329
Does that really impress you,
Mrs Carleton?

22:21.760 --> 22:23.205
Call me May.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.123
Charlie says the box Van's here.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.890
Thank you, Finn.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.208
You know, I still don't know what
you're going to call your horse.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.283
The horse will be called Grace's Secret.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.564
Grace's Secret.

22:56.720 --> 22:59.610
I told him he definitely
can't take the job.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.766
He said, "All right,
I'll move to London, then."

23:03.840 --> 23:07.686
I said, "I won't give in to blackmail.
No is no."

23:09.160 --> 23:12.403
Well... That settles it, then.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.285
I'll give the job
to the other candidate.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.328
He's much better qualified anyway.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.166
Michael did City and Guilds, six months.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.402
Yeah, but he doesn't know racing, Poll.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.409
He knows horses,
but he doesn't know racing.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.962
This other boy, he knows racing.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.929
He's good. He's a fast learner.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.362
What if Michael really leaves?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.882
You just got to let him go, Poll.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.611
He'll get a job in an office in London.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.170
I'm sure he'll write to you.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.730
He made a big speech

23:48.800 --> 23:53.169
about wanting to help you
build up a respectable business.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.004
Oh, he's like his dad,
he could make me cry.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.050
There are trains to London.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.890
So I just let him leave?

24:00.400 --> 24:02.289
Every month or so he'd be back.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.523
Unless, of course, he meets a girl.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.723
Then, who knows?

24:13.080 --> 24:14.889
Oh, my God.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.010
You want him to do this job.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.084
Polly, I want what you want.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.162
What about this other more
qualified candidate?

24:26.880 --> 24:29.008
Mmm...

24:29.080 --> 24:30.684
Well, I lied, there isn't one.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.244
How much you paying?

24:38.760 --> 24:40.888
- The advertised rate.
-Like hell.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.648
- Three bob.
-Like hell.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.449
- Three and six.
-Four.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.365
Four it is.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.889
- I love him, Tom.
-I know.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.649
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

25:00.720 --> 25:03.121
put him charge of the new. Agreed?

25:04.280 --> 25:05.850
Agreed.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.925
Well, Finn, you've got two choices,
mild or mild.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.080
- Mild.
-There you go.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.686
--Here he is, look.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.404
Happy birthday, Michael.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.410
Eighteen years old. You're a man today.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.766
Give him a drink, John boy.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.166
- There you go, lad.
-And after that,

25:35.600 --> 25:37.682
we'll go to find you
a lady of the night.

25:37.760 --> 25:38.966
Arthur!

25:42.800 --> 25:44.768
Michael.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.444
What's that?

25:46.760 --> 25:48.728
So you're never late for work.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.407
Welcome to the business,
Michael.

25:55.480 --> 25:58.723
- Welcome to the business.
-Thank you.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.882
Right, come on, let's get him drunk.
Come here, you.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.166
All right, whisky.

26:02.240 --> 26:06.325
No whisky, he's at work tomorrow.
Give him only dark mild.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.447
A toast.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.290
- Toast.
- To Michael.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.964
To Michael.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.850
You all right?

26:38.360 --> 26:40.886
- What is it?just us?
-just us.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.291
We celebrating?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.211
just taste this.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.771
What do you think, Arthur?

27:01.840 --> 27:05.401
Yeah, it's good.
Good stuff, really nice.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.403
Too good for the Garrison.

27:07.480 --> 27:10.848
I suppose we could shift it
to the toffs at the Eden Club.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.005
Why? What is it?

27:13.520 --> 27:15.284
That is part of an export drive.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.770
We now have a secure warehouse
in Camden Town

27:19.840 --> 27:22.764
and secure passage to the Poplar Docks.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.683
So, on Monday morning,

27:24.760 --> 27:27.525
we'll be sending out
our first export crates.

27:27.600 --> 27:31.241
A crate of Riley car spa res,

27:31.360 --> 27:33.408
bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.810
Where there's prohibition.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.890
Where there is prohibition.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.009
All over Canada and America,

27:42.200 --> 27:45.044
people are making their own booze
in bathtubs.

27:45.160 --> 27:50.371
But rich people in New York,
in Toronto and Boston

27:50.680 --> 27:52.603
are still paying a lot of
money for the real stuff.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.962
So, on Monday,
the first Shelby company crates

27:57.040 --> 28:00.169
will contain a thousand
Riley carburettors.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.845
But hidden in the packing
will be 500 bottles

28:04.920 --> 28:09.130
of the finest quality
single malt Scotch whisky.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.329
And we Shelbys, have a licence

28:14.400 --> 28:16.482
granted by the
Minister Of The Empire himself,

28:17.200 --> 28:19.771
which means our crates
won't be searched.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.810
And, Polly, all of the whisky
will be packed at the docks,

28:22.880 --> 28:26.202
so Michael can do the books
without being involved.

28:26.720 --> 28:29.371
Like I've been telling
you all for a year now,

28:30.160 --> 28:31.764
motor cars are the future.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.611
So, how is your life then, Tom?

28:38.680 --> 28:41.331
On the up, Johnny, on the up.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.882
But, Tom, really, come on, how is it?

28:44.960 --> 28:48.043
You know I hate to
see you not even married yet.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.681
I have a fine looking cousin,
she'll make your life hell.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.000
You deserve her!

28:55.480 --> 28:58.484
We haven't had a good old
wedding in a long time.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.963
Rather look inside these boxes,
then, Johnny?

29:03.800 --> 29:05.609
What do I want to look
at car parts, Tommy,

29:05.680 --> 29:07.125
when I haven't even got a car?

29:09.960 --> 29:12.042
Faith in family's a fine thing, eh?

29:13.240 --> 29:15.208
And I wouldn't even be counting.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.924
Twenty-five becomes 24, then 24 it is.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.844
Oh, you know I'm no good
with numbers, Tom.

29:22.880 --> 29:25.929
And if 24 ever became 23,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.684
then that'd be tax.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.125
We don't pay tax.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.445
No, Tom.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.725
Good man.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.123
I put an iron door on,

29:48.200 --> 29:51.090
and we've put iron bars on the
windows and across the skylights.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.491
Good.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.050
So what will you
be keeping in here, Tommy?

29:55.080 --> 29:57.686
Temptation, Billy. Temptation.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.762
Morning, Arthur. I was just passing.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.203
I think I'm in fucking love.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.560
Drink!

30:29.200 --> 30:30.770
She don't know where to look.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.526
Whisky, Tommy?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.404
No, I've got a long drive ahead.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.925
You off home?

30:38.440 --> 30:41.364
Mmm-hmm. Eventually.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.091
To Birmingham.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.006
What's this?

30:52.120 --> 30:53.326
Olives.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.004
Yes, it's miscellaneous.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.241
It's, erm, olives.

30:58.440 --> 31:02.525
Sticks, you know, with little bits
of fucking onion and things.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.011
That's what that is.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.202
We've taken 600 pounds on olives.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.129
Yeah, with little bits of onion.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.450
I told you, Arthur...

31:25.240 --> 31:28.801
The dealers sell the cocaine,
we take a cut.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.008
We don't sell direct.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.090
The Home Secretary's cracking down

31:33.200 --> 31:35.009
and I don't want this,

31:35.080 --> 31:37.686
to fuck up everything else,
you understand?

31:38.880 --> 31:40.928
I understand.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.521
How much of that 600
came out of your pocket?

31:51.400 --> 31:52.890
It's under control.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.766
I put you down here cos people
are scared of you, Arthur.

31:58.360 --> 32:02.001
But if you don't straighten up,
it'll be John's turn in London.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.282
No need.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.691
I can handle it.

32:08.280 --> 32:09.725
It's under control?

32:10.920 --> 32:12.331
It's under control.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.249
Fucking tidy profit, though, eh?

32:28.160 --> 32:29.650
It's happening, Tom.

32:32.720 --> 32:33.926
Good.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.081
Good.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.130
Straighten up, soldier.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.768
Yes, sir, Sergeant Major.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.246
What's your business?

33:29.720 --> 33:32.087
Sorry, I'm, er, I'm lost here.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.005
Yeah, well, you can't stop here.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.884
- Move on.
-All right.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.529
Twenty-three seconds.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.251
It's all right, Ada,
it'll be Andrew for me.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.331
Oh.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.123
I'm looking for Ada.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.565
Who are you?

34:16.920 --> 34:18.684
Ada.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.444
I asked you a question.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.248
It's all right, James.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.561
This is my brother.

34:24.719 --> 34:25.960
Who's he?

34:26.040 --> 34:27.371
He rents a room.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.204
You need to rent out rooms?

34:29.280 --> 34:31.089
Actually, she doesn't charge rent.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.641
He's a writer, which means he's skint.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.130
You get up late these days, Ada.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.929
Mmm. I go to bed late.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.525
Yeah? Where's Karl?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.570
What do you want, Tommy?

34:45.560 --> 34:48.688
Oh, God, before you start
sizing him up for a wedding suit,

34:48.760 --> 34:50.409
he's not interested in me.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.766
- Or in girls of any kind.
-Ada!

34:52.840 --> 34:54.284
What? Tommy won’t judge you.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.090
He sure as hell won't go to the police.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.168
Look, I'll go and get dressed.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.924
James...

35:02.000 --> 35:03.684
I'm Thomas.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.446
Pleased to meet you.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.401
Can I have a minute
with my sister, please?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.411
Yes, of course.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.286
So, does your lodger know your name?

35:25.360 --> 35:27.044
Yeah. Thorne.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.403
You think I'd tell anybody
anything else?

35:30.080 --> 35:33.243
Your Brummie boys
are all over the papers.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.448
Just one last push, eh?
Then you'll go legit?

35:35.960 --> 35:39.282
Just one more obstacle to get round,
then it'll all be straight?

35:39.480 --> 35:40.891
Actually, yes.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.482
Personally, I find it quite amusing.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.200
Men like you are becoming
very fashionable down here.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.929
No society party in London
is complete without a gangster

35:51.080 --> 35:52.730
for the girls to go giddy for.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.681
Anyway, what is it that you want?

35:58.720 --> 36:00.609
I don't have any children, Ada,

36:04.560 --> 36:05.891
so I have set up a trust fund.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.683
The beneficiaries
will be John's kids and Karl.

36:12.120 --> 36:15.966
In order for Karl to benefit,
I need your signature.

36:19.040 --> 36:22.442
I've set up an account.

36:22.520 --> 36:26.650
The money will be transferred
in the event of my death.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.007
It'll set them up for a new life.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.004
Are you sick?

36:40.080 --> 36:42.765
I'm just doing
what any ordinary man would,

36:42.840 --> 36:44.330
putting my affairs in order.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.687
<i>Did you know they was
going to take the Eden club?</i>

37:16.760 --> 37:19.491
I know about the Eden club, yes.

37:19.560 --> 37:21.608
Did you know they were going
to do it before they did it?

37:21.760 --> 37:24.411
Because that's someone
who's in charge, isn't it?

37:25.080 --> 37:27.082
The one who knows before it happens.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.648
I know what I know, you know.

37:29.720 --> 37:33.930
If you don't know,
then you don't fucking know, do you?

37:34.880 --> 37:37.451
Did you know they was going
to take Wimbledon Docks?

37:38.240 --> 37:40.481
Harringay? The trotting tracks?

37:42.760 --> 37:47.163
Talk, all right?
I genuinely want to hear you.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.571
You've lost control, Alfie.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.971
Have I?

37:50.040 --> 37:51.485
Everybody knows.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.727
- Talk to me, Alfie.
-Talk to you?

37:58.480 --> 38:01.484
All right, I'll talk to you.
I'll fucking tell you how it was, right?

38:01.560 --> 38:03.528
What happened was this.

38:04.320 --> 38:08.120
All the time you were talking about
dirty fucking Jews.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.440
All the fucking time,

38:09.560 --> 38:11.847
dirty fucking Jews, dirty Kikes,
dirty dustbin lids...

38:11.920 --> 38:13.365
- Everyone makes jokes.
-You want to talk about

38:13.440 --> 38:16.683
-not getting into places?
-Everybody makes fucking jokes.

38:16.760 --> 38:19.127
I didn't know you had
no sense of humour!

38:19.280 --> 38:22.648
And I ain't going
to fucking mention, right,

38:22.720 --> 38:27.044
the great big fuck off elephant
in the room.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.931
Look, Alfie...

38:30.000 --> 38:33.721
How many of my bookies
worked Epsom this last May?

38:33.800 --> 38:35.529
None. None.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.410
Not one.

38:37.480 --> 38:41.326
So, for a few fucking jokes and Epsom,

38:41.400 --> 38:44.882
you fucking invite
a tribe of savages into the city

38:44.960 --> 38:47.930
and just fucking
unlock the fucking gates!

38:52.960 --> 38:55.008
I'm sorry, what are you saying, mate?

38:55.640 --> 38:57.085
I'm saying...

38:58.480 --> 39:00.960
I'm sorry about the Jew thing.

39:02.160 --> 39:04.561
- You saying you're sorry?
-Yeah.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.361
- You're sorry about the Jew thing?
-Yeah.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.844
- Really?
-Yea h.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.450
I want that in writing.
Write that down. He said, "I'm sorry".

39:15.760 --> 39:17.489
And also write down

39:17.800 --> 39:20.326
that all our bookies
can go back to Epsom.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.084
- He didn't say that.
-Who's asking you?

39:22.160 --> 39:23.161
Eh.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.324
Write it down.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.767
It's all right. Come on.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.330
Alfie's an old friend.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.290
My friend.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.250
Now, admit it,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.368
the Peaky Blinders is out of control.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.762
Yeah, they're out
of fucking control, mate.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.162
They come down the canal,
they spread like the fucking clap.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.411
Right. So now they're

39:49.600 --> 39:51.090
-everybody's problem.
-Yeah.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.444
- Alfie.
-Mmm.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.728
You and me, we've been fighting

39:55.800 --> 39:57.484
-since we was at school.
-Yeah.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.768
All right? Now, also,

40:00.040 --> 40:01.883
-we've been friends.
-Mmm, yeah.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.886
You know,
it goes backwards and forwards.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.490
How much better is it
when we're friends?

40:08.120 --> 40:09.565
Oh, it's much better, mate, yeah.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.251
You write that down.

40:11.840 --> 40:12.841
Mmm.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.171
So what we're doing here, right,

40:15.240 --> 40:18.881
is we're writing down some
kind of a deal thing, right?

40:18.960 --> 40:21.566
- Yeah, a written deal.
-Written deal, good.

40:22.040 --> 40:26.841
Well, why don't we discuss
the border between the Italians

40:26.920 --> 40:28.968
and the Jews going back
to Farringdon Road.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.530
- Farringdon Road...
-Yeah, Farringdon Road.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.523
Fuck! That's ancient history.

40:33.800 --> 40:36.451
- Write down Farringdon Road.
-No, no, no, write down Camden Road.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.204
- Farringdon Road.
-Camden Road.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.361
- Write down Farringdon.
-Camden.

40:39.440 --> 40:40.566
- Farringdon.
-Camden.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.404
Write down Camden Road.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.324
Just write down "peace".

40:45.400 --> 40:47.448
Just write down "peace", right,

40:47.640 --> 40:51.850
between the Jews and the Italians.

40:53.240 --> 40:57.131
And war against the gypsies.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.606
Fuck.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.884
Mr Thomas Shelby, madam.

41:44.520 --> 41:45.885
Nice house.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.490
Would you like a whisky?

41:52.040 --> 41:53.610
Scotch or Irish?

41:54.160 --> 41:55.730
Irish.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.450
Sorry for the short notice.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.608
I was passing.

42:06.880 --> 42:08.644
We're not quite on the Birmingham road.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.889
It was a small diversion.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.485
Sixty miles, I checked.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.488
That's a small diversion these days.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.845
So, I'm a small diversion.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.160
Good.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.804
Your horse is still out on the gallops,

42:25.880 --> 42:27.689
but I had Mickey prepare this report.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.723
You can read it now if you'd like,
then we can go see her.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.927
--Is there enough light for you to read?

42:41.000 --> 42:42.286
Yes, it's fine.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.325
It's getting quite late.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.121
Mickey says she has
the lungs of an elephant.

42:59.360 --> 43:00.600
She's nimble in the heavy going,

43:00.680 --> 43:01.966
but bounces a little on the hard ground.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.211
Sorry, I'll let you read.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.971
So, he thinks she'll favour
good to soft ground, eh?

43:11.600 --> 43:13.602
- A little juice in the grass.
-Mmm.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.369
Well, that's good for Epsom.

43:18.440 --> 43:21.046
Does he think she's
not good enough for Epsom?

43:22.240 --> 43:23.844
She needs a lot of work.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.330
The race board will need convincing.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.330
- I imagine you have some influence.
-Mmm.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.368
That's the suggested programme
for the next two months.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.805
Your glass is empty.

43:40.280 --> 43:41.770
It's fine.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.570
Are you hungry?

43:46.960 --> 43:48.610
Yes, a bit.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.731
I can prepare something.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.491
Do you have engine oil?

43:56.360 --> 43:59.045
Before I set off for Birmingham,
the car needs oil.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.924
I'm sure my husband
kept some in the garage.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.411
I can get someone to do it.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.243
This evening or tomorrow?

44:11.360 --> 44:14.011
Well, we're so far from anywhere,
people usually stay over.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.443
Especially before cars,
when it was just carriages,

44:18.520 --> 44:20.170
people used to stay over all the time.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.285
But I have a car.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.771
Yes.

44:27.160 --> 44:30.164
And you have engine oil.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.610
Probably.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.684
But it would be very usual.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.405
What would?

44:43.080 --> 44:44.206
For a guest to stay.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.044
We have a whole wing
called the guest wing.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.085
Oh, you...

44:49.680 --> 44:50.966
You have a guest wing.

44:53.040 --> 44:54.565
Well...

45:01.840 --> 45:03.330
May.

45:13.320 --> 45:15.084
Have a smoke.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.810
Thank you.

45:24.960 --> 45:26.883
Ignore this. It's actually all right.

45:30.120 --> 45:32.566
I put all his photos
in a drawer and locked it...

45:34.000 --> 45:35.923
As if that was going
to make a difference.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.602
I'm like a fucking lighthouse keeper...

45:45.720 --> 45:47.370
Out here on my own...

45:49.680 --> 45:51.728
Keeping his flame burning.

45:51.800 --> 45:55.486
But, of course,
when anyone sees a lighthouse

45:56.240 --> 45:57.651
they steer clear, don't they?

46:09.400 --> 46:10.925
Now, do you have a map?

46:14.600 --> 46:16.602
Of the house. Do you have a map?

46:19.120 --> 46:23.205
Because I'm not going to be able
to find my way in the dark.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.490
You see, at midnight,

46:30.560 --> 46:33.404
I'm going to leave my wing

46:34.080 --> 46:35.605
and I'm going to come find you.

46:37.400 --> 46:40.449
And I'm going to turn the handle
of your bedroom door

46:40.520 --> 46:42.488
without making a sound

46:42.560 --> 46:44.289
and none of the maids will know.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.365
You don't know maids.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.405
They hear a pin drop?

46:52.320 --> 46:55.085
If there's a man in the house,
they listen.

46:56.160 --> 46:57.605
They take turns.

46:58.760 --> 47:00.489
So, let them listen.

47:05.640 --> 47:09.361
Right. Day rate, seven shillings.
Loading, unloading.

47:09.520 --> 47:12.205
Night rate, three. Total ten.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.764
Let's go and get a drink.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.251
No, I'm all right.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.925
Come on, it's payday.

47:18.120 --> 47:19.451
Everybody has a drink on payday.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.051
Not me.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.481
You think your mum
don't have a drink on payday?

47:24.360 --> 47:28.331
You think the Lord Almighty
don't have a drink on payday?

47:30.040 --> 47:32.088
Man, it's on fire out there,

47:32.160 --> 47:35.164
women from the BSA offices, honest.

47:35.320 --> 47:38.051
They go out on their own
without their men these days,

47:38.120 --> 47:39.451
in twos and threes now.

47:40.800 --> 47:44.361
Mickey, they go out in twos and
threes and buy their own drinks.

47:49.480 --> 47:53.644
The Marquis,
that's where the BSA secretaries go.

47:57.680 --> 48:02.481
Look, they won't serve a black man
without a Shelby by his side.

48:07.640 --> 48:09.130
So you're using me?

48:12.160 --> 48:13.491
Yeah.

48:13.720 --> 48:15.085
Come on.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.604
I told you, I fucking told you,
this city's gone mad.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.570
Girls go out on their own now.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.643
Two pints of dark mild, please.

48:32.840 --> 48:34.649
Fuck that. We're Peaky boys.

48:34.760 --> 48:36.171
Two whiskies.

48:44.440 --> 48:46.522
You get used to it, then you can't stop.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.568
I don't drink with blacks.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.370
Here we fucking go.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.807
Paddy, they're okay.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.526
Not with me, they're not.

49:01.600 --> 49:03.568
I don't drink in pubs with blacks.

49:03.640 --> 49:04.971
So leave.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.406
Look, my dad is the preacher round here.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.409
He has connections, ask anybody.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.726
I couldn't give a fuck who he is.

49:13.480 --> 49:15.050
I'm telling you to leave it, Paddy.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.726
And I'm telling this darkie
to get out of here.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.211
You know something? Fuck off.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.009
It's all right, Isaiah, come on,
leave it.

49:21.080 --> 49:23.367
- We'll go to my cousin's pub.
-I like it here.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.843
You fucking nigger.

49:48.760 --> 49:51.286
Paddy! The white kid's a Peaky Blinder!

49:51.440 --> 49:53.090
He's Polly Shelby's son!

49:54.720 --> 49:58.520
He's Polly Shelby's son!
Are you fucking suicidal?

49:58.920 --> 50:00.490
Sir...

50:00.560 --> 50:01.800
Sir, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.570
Get out!

50:03.720 --> 50:05.085
Get out the fucking pub.

50:05.240 --> 50:06.924
I clearly didn't know.

50:07.120 --> 50:09.248
Fuck, let's go. Let's go!

50:11.480 --> 50:13.323
We ordered some drinks

50:13.600 --> 50:15.364
and we're going to drink them.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.046
His face, man.
Did you see his fucking face?

50:29.120 --> 50:30.884
You punch like a fucking kangaroo.

50:30.960 --> 50:33.930
I seen one once in a circus,
you punch like that.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.969
All right, anyway,
I need a fucking drink.

50:37.040 --> 50:39.771
- It's on you.
-It's on me? You just got paid.

50:39.840 --> 50:41.251
Yeah, from you.

50:41.680 --> 50:44.001
You can get a whisky,
maybe even a dark mild.

50:48.320 --> 50:51.529
Fucking hell,
it's packed in here, isn't it?

50:52.360 --> 50:53.566
So it's as easy as that?

50:53.640 --> 50:56.962
Easy as that, John boy.
London, you wouldn't believe it.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.765
Finn, stick your head in a bucket.

50:58.840 --> 51:00.330
No.

51:00.520 --> 51:02.727
The women, John boy, the women...

51:03.280 --> 51:05.726
I've got this one,
she's a dancer, right?

51:05.800 --> 51:07.609
She can do things with her...

51:10.920 --> 51:13.207
If Finn would just piss off,
I'd explain a little bit better.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.767
Well, if it's so good, why are you here?

51:16.640 --> 51:18.449
Decent pints.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.324
The cockneys can't get that right.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.767
He misses us, Finn, that's what it is.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.209
Here they are, look, junior Peaky boys.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.762
What's happened to you?
You been scrapping?

51:34.280 --> 51:35.770
Some idiots at the Marquis of Lorne.

51:35.840 --> 51:38.605
Tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

51:38.800 --> 51:40.211
We fought them off.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.529
Arthur, we had to stand
our ground and we did.

51:43.760 --> 51:46.206
The Marquis, eh? Where's your dad?

51:47.320 --> 51:49.049
- Preaching.
-Right.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.251
Don't nick any of me chips, Finn!

51:54.320 --> 51:56.288
- Where are you going?
- We won't be long.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.410
Where are they going?

52:00.480 --> 52:01.720
The Marquis of Lorne.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.405
Shame.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.050
It was a nice pub.

54:01.800 --> 54:04.451
Eh-up. Bet the big bastard got cut.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.090
You didn't have to do that for me.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.650
We didn't do it for you, Michael.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.882
We did it for the good name
of the company.

54:13.960 --> 54:16.361
None of this happened, all right?

54:16.440 --> 54:18.408
Come on, let's go and get that drink.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.770
The date has been set.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.688
Three weeks from today.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.844
You checked out his house?

54:58.640 --> 55:00.369
There's coppers all over it.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.689
You'll take care of them?

55:03.960 --> 55:05.962
No. That would arouse suspicion.

55:07.520 --> 55:09.249
You'll have to deal with them yourself.

55:12.080 --> 55:13.844
And if a copper gets killed?

55:16.160 --> 55:20.051
There will be no consequences
for you, I have given you my word.

55:20.120 --> 55:22.009
Which I know to be worthless.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.965
That is why I have been settling
my affairs in the event of my death.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.450
And making your peace
with God, perhaps?

55:36.760 --> 55:38.489
Well, good luck with that.

55:43.640 --> 55:47.486
I have made arrangements
with men I trust.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.522
If I should die,

55:51.600 --> 55:53.045
then you will die.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.011
Know that.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.568
Ritz Hotel.

57:31.640 --> 57:33.085
London, Piccadilly.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.046
Hello?

57:45.800 --> 57:47.245
<i>Hello?</i>

57:53.440 --> 57:55.090
- Who was that?
-Call got cut.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.927
<i>I guess the telephone lines
in England are not so good, huh?</i>

57:58.000 --> 57:59.001
Hm.

58:01.000 --> 58:11.001
