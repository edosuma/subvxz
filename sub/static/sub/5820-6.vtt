00:02.000 --> 00:05.004
( Snarling )

00:08.000 --> 00:09.445
Sasha on walkie:
All right.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.284
Daryl on walkie:
That's 20?

00:11.440 --> 00:13.283
Sasha: It will be.
642 is a mile ahead.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.250
We gotta put distance between us
and them before the turnoff.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.890
Abraham on walkie:
So floor it.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.407
Daryl:
All right, try to keep up.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.562
Sasha: Daryl, have you looked
at this car?

00:22.720 --> 00:25.530
( Chuckles ) Believe me,
we want to get back there, too.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.640
(gunfire)

00:55.760 --> 00:58.411
( gunfire continues )

01:00.080 --> 01:02.401
( bullets ricocheting )

01:05.239 --> 01:07.242
( engine starts )

01:11.560 --> 01:12.800
( tires squeal )

01:12.960 --> 01:15.122
(gunfire)

01:20.120 --> 01:21.610
(grunts)

01:24.800 --> 01:27.121
( gunfire continues )

01:28.920 --> 01:30.922
( snarling )

01:38.920 --> 01:40.809
( snarling )

01:56.400 --> 01:58.687
Leaveit

01:58.840 --> 02:01.286
Just gonna give it
a last little polish.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.844
What the hell
you got to grin about?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.729
We won, darlin'.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.328
There could be more.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.285
- ( Tires squealing )
- ( cars approaching )

02:13.480 --> 02:15.164
Screw it.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.690
( Panting )

03:01.520 --> 03:03.727
(walker growling )

03:18.920 --> 03:21.890
( theme music playing )

03:57.120 --> 03:59.805
(birds calling)

04:02.560 --> 04:04.927
(grunting )

04:30.440 --> 04:33.125
( panting )

04:41.440 --> 04:43.283
Sasha?

04:43.440 --> 04:44.805
Abraham,
are you there?

04:44.960 --> 04:46.849
( Static hissing )

05:09.320 --> 05:11.687
(wincing )

05:20.960 --> 05:22.689
( exhales )

05:33.680 --> 05:35.682
( branch snaps )

05:37.360 --> 05:39.010
( rustling )

06:26.720 --> 06:28.051
You found us, okay?

06:28.240 --> 06:29.890
Here we are.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.769
We earned what we took.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.285
( Branch snaps )

06:33.440 --> 06:35.442
(thumps)

06:35.600 --> 06:40.208
( echoing ) Probably just another
soldier from one of the outposts.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.249
Probably hates him, too.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.371
( Echoing )
You know how to use one?

06:47.520 --> 06:49.363
( Man's voice echoing )
Yeah.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.249
Never liked using them to hunt.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.409
( Echoing ) We pick up Patty
and we're gone, okay?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.921
This is the last day
we gotta live like this.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.808
( Crickets chirping )

07:08.600 --> 07:11.285
Get up.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.284
Hey, get up.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.125
( Safety unlocks )

07:17.280 --> 07:20.568
We're moving.
Here's the deal.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.451
You don't say shit
and I don't kill you.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.965
I ain't who you think.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.442
-( Hammer clicks )
- Say something else.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.409
Go ahead.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.089
Follow them.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.007
Here, drink the rest.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.486
- We should save it.
- We'll find some more.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.801
Drink.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.962
You're supposed
to stay hydrated.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.810
It all works together.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.689
Yeah, it does.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.690
Have it.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.842
We don't need you
falling down. Drink.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.290
They find us,
maybe we give you to them,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.369
they let us call it even.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.682
You see,
we're reasonable people.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.126
Everybody's got their code.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.642
You feel you gotta kneel,
that's fair enough.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.643
We don't.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.370
Let's go.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.004
I can't believe we're back.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.889
It's not home anymore,

08:57.040 --> 08:59.008
but it's better
than where we were.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.049
This is a pit stop.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.204
We pick up Patty,
nothing more than that.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.685
How'd you do it?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.171
You saw where we left the truck?

09:10.360 --> 09:12.010
Mm-hmm.

09:12.160 --> 09:16.051
We opened the valve and drove
all the way in from Farmview Road.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.130
Ran from the tree line
till we got to the pavement.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.084
Lit up a matchbook
from the Sweetwater

09:22.240 --> 09:24.083
- and dropped it in on the trail.
- ( growling )

09:24.240 --> 09:27.210
Then we just ran for the car.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.045
Got in and the dead ones
were there.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.090
They were beating
on the hood, and then--

09:33.240 --> 09:35.891
and then boom!

09:36.040 --> 09:39.965
Knocked 'em on their <i>asses</i>
and I took an axe to each one.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.566
Then we just
watched it go up.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.769
No more moans,
no more of that wailing.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.891
It was just the fire,
just burning them all away.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.923
You did all this?

09:53.080 --> 09:54.570
It was right at the start.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.609
Everything stopped--
the TV, the radio.

09:56.760 --> 10:00.082
We were here.
The forest was full of them.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.123
And the other ones in town,
they were drawn to it.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.930
They just walked
right into the flames.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.603
We got most of them.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.604
Thought we ended it for us,
and she was in DC.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.401
We thought everyone was fighting them
wherever they were.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.131
Yeah, we thought that was
what everybody was doing.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.964
Fighting it.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.088
That we'd all win together.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.281
We were stupid.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.091
Y'all don't think you're being stupid
right now?

10:30.600 --> 10:32.090
( Hammer clicks )

10:33.800 --> 10:35.723
Are you saying
I should kill you?

10:37.640 --> 10:41.326
I mean it, are you gonna try
and pull something on us?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.484
Are we just being thick here
by not removing all doubt?

10:47.120 --> 10:49.691
Right now, by me
not pulling this trigger,

10:49.840 --> 10:52.320
is that a mistake?

10:52.480 --> 10:55.324
I'm serious.
I really wanna know.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.608
You made a choice
to kill for someone else,

10:57.800 --> 11:01.009
to have them own you for a roof over
your head and three squares,

11:01.160 --> 11:04.369
so maybe I'm not considering
all aspects here.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.808
You tell me,
am I being stupid?

11:10.520 --> 11:12.409
No.

11:12.560 --> 11:15.564
Look, I got somewhere to be.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.563
We can make a deal.
I can help you out.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.690
You're one of them.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.367
You're hurt and you're alone
and you'd say anything.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.481
We should've never trusted
you people to begin with.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.244
Go on.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.051
Keep moving.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.362
(walkers growling )

11:44.720 --> 11:47.690
(walkers growling )

11:47.840 --> 11:49.729
Son of a bitch.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.609
( Growling continues )

12:05.040 --> 12:06.690
Patty.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.806
She could be...

12:12.040 --> 12:13.565
(woman sighs )

12:17.440 --> 12:19.408
No, she's gone.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.289
Then we make another plan.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.283
Yeah, we get out of here,
that's the plan.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.930
Then that's the plan.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.208
You guys didn't have
to do this for me.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.603
It was the right thing
for all of us.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.047
This was the right thing?

12:39.200 --> 12:40.804
Even if just you guys
went back now,

12:40.960 --> 12:43.327
if you just told them
that it was me...

12:43.480 --> 12:45.289
No, we'll find a way.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.408
- Just think about it.
- No.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.291
Look, maybe we don't get as far,
but we'll get-- hey!

12:50.440 --> 12:51.601
- Hey. hey, hey!
- Tina, hey!

12:51.760 --> 12:52.807
Hey, baby sister,
look at me.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.240
Hey: stQp!
No!

12:54.400 --> 12:55.447
( Gunshots )

12:55.600 --> 12:57.728
Don't!
We need that, please!

13:06.240 --> 13:08.811
( Panting )

13:19.960 --> 13:21.610
Sasha, Abraham,
are you there?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.808
( Static hissing )

13:27.200 --> 13:29.328
(walker growling )

13:31.000 --> 13:33.810
(growling )

13:45.160 --> 13:48.482
( snarling )

14:02.360 --> 14:04.840
( snarling continues )

14:13.000 --> 14:15.571
( panting )

14:34.360 --> 14:36.886
Sasha:
There, it's clear.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.849
His bike's gone.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.409
These are his shells.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.722
He fired at 'em, got away.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.887
He caught a good bounce.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.891
There aren't
enough people around

14:55.080 --> 14:57.731
to just wait around
for somebody to ambush.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.609
And they couldn't have just been
watching us,

14:59.760 --> 15:01.683
not with what we were doing.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.731
Nah, they were looking to chew up
someone in particular.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.207
Whoever the hell they were.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.081
Daryl, you copy?

15:13.240 --> 15:15.242
( Static hissing )

15:17.120 --> 15:18.929
Daryl?

15:19.080 --> 15:22.289
Dollars to doughnuts,
he's on his way back to Alexandria now.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.881
- He wouldn't leave us behind.
- He already did.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.929
But he came back.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.242
So we go look for him.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.085
The best way to find a tracker
is to stay put.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.611
Let him find you.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.886
You just want us to sit here

15:37.080 --> 15:39.606
with our precious leathers
in our hands?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.091
No.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.768
(walker growling )

16:08.680 --> 16:10.808
Don't.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.291
What?

16:12.440 --> 16:14.204
You're smarter than that.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.371
We don't need
to leave bread crumbs.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.610
( Door creaks )

16:23.760 --> 16:25.444
( door closes )

17:16.240 --> 17:17.730
( flashlight clicks )

17:24.040 --> 17:27.964
( snarling )

17:28.119 --> 17:31.806
How come gorgeous over here
is still standing?

17:31.960 --> 17:33.928
He can't get out.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.242
(thumping )

17:36.400 --> 17:39.722
It's locked. We're fine.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.409
Stand watch or sleep?
Your choice.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.085
I'll take the former.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.242
Do a little shopping, maybe.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.243
( Thumping continues )

18:04.240 --> 18:06.242
(growling )

18:06.400 --> 18:08.607
( drawers rattling )

18:21.920 --> 18:24.002
( walker snarls )

18:28.840 --> 18:31.241
(growling )

18:37.440 --> 18:39.807
( bag thuds )

18:39.960 --> 18:41.291
Can't sleep?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.166
What does it look like?

18:45.320 --> 18:47.129
I just wanted to know
if it was a choice.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.204
(walker growling )

18:50.360 --> 18:52.124
( sighs )
You have no idea how much

18:52.280 --> 18:55.204
I want to release that thing
from this plane of existence.

18:55.400 --> 18:59.644
(walker growling )

18:59.800 --> 19:03.043
( sighs, chuckles )

19:04.800 --> 19:06.689
This our new home?

19:10.680 --> 19:14.002
Should we give him a name?

19:14.160 --> 19:16.128
You got yourself into this.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.528
I was driving that car solo
until you chose to come with.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.563
Oh, I didn't have a choice there.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.489
Tell me why.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.489
You going stag
was not an option.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.650
Tell me why.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.850
You were out of control
for a good while there.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.922
Just about took my arm off
on the road to paradise.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.606
- You remember that?
- I do.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.881
- I'm in control now.
- Me, too.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.128
That's why you wanna
kill that walker?

19:51.280 --> 19:53.408
The one down the street?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.289
The guys in the car?

19:55.440 --> 19:57.010
'Cause you're in control.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.482
'Cause loose ends
make my ass itch.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.966
If I have not gotten
my psyche situated straight,

20:07.120 --> 20:11.409
it's because the shit's continually
been hitting the fan without respite.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.648
Oh, there's been respite.
There was a party.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.131
Oh, I remember that.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.931
You had the time
of your life there.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.563
You don't have to throw yourself
out of a moving car...

20:24.800 --> 20:27.246
...to feel like
you're calling the ball.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.890
That's easy.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.562
You jump out of an airplane,
you don't have choices after that.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.927
Maybe you play some chicken
with the ground,

20:35.080 --> 20:39.404
but you pull the rip cord,
you live.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.609
But if you have
a roof over your head,

20:42.800 --> 20:45.770
you have food,
you have walls...

20:47.440 --> 20:49.329
you have choices.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.486
And without walkers and bullets

20:55.640 --> 20:58.928
and shit hitting the fan,

20:59.080 --> 21:02.482
you're accountable for them.

21:02.640 --> 21:06.122
I mean, hell,
you're always accountable.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.688
It's just with all that other noise,

21:09.840 --> 21:13.003
you know people won't notice.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.048
(growling )

21:30.480 --> 21:33.211
Stand watch or sleep.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.328
The former.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.724
Straight through the night.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.486
We'll reassess in the morning.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.130
What do you mean?

21:44.320 --> 21:46.288
What the hell we're doing here.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.000
Drop the gun.
Drop it.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.524
Give it to me.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.886
I came all this way.
What you got for the duffel?

22:26.040 --> 22:29.203
You put me through too much shit
just to give it back.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.600
Principle of the thing.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.842
What you got
besides this gun?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.684
Nothing.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.088
What was that thing
you were carving?

22:44.360 --> 22:46.283
- My grandfather taught me how--
- Daryl: Don't care.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.249
It'll do.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.883
Take it.
It's all there.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.922
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.402
( Trees snapping )

23:08.720 --> 23:10.404
( brakes squealing )

23:14.480 --> 23:17.131
( truck door opens, closes )

23:21.240 --> 23:23.129
Let's end this.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.328
It's ours.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.164
We earned what we took.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.926
Man: You're gonna return
what you took.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.924
You're gonna pay for the gas it took
to come out here

23:33.080 --> 23:35.162
and for all the time
these men took out.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.641
It's over.
You know the rules.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.690
Your rules are batshit!

23:40.840 --> 23:43.320
We're not going back, Wade.
We're done kneeling!

23:43.520 --> 23:45.249
Don't change the subject,
asshole.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.761
- ( Whistles )
- ( truck engine revs )

23:47.920 --> 23:49.604
( trees snapping )

23:54.360 --> 23:56.647
( brakes squeal )

23:59.120 --> 24:00.770
Come on.
Hey, that way.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.604
Come on.
Go, go, go.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.171
Go.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.651
Get up.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.326
( Tree snapping )

24:26.280 --> 24:28.169
<i>He'! '</i>

24:28.360 --> 24:29.964
Take it.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.484
- ( Walkie static hisses )
- Wade on walkie: Eyes open.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.803
You cover your quadrant.
Go to alpha channel.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.809
(growling )

24:48.840 --> 24:51.241
(weakly )
Love you, Sher.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.210
You didn't have to... for me.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.771
(mumbling )

24:59.760 --> 25:01.888
( rustles )

25:08.160 --> 25:10.049
- ( snarling )
- ( screaming )

25:14.440 --> 25:18.889
Wade, I'm bit!

25:21.560 --> 25:23.085
- Take it off me.
- Damn it.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.402
Do it!
Just take it off!

25:28.960 --> 25:31.042
Wade: I'll get
your watch after.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.601
( Man screams, crying )

25:40.880 --> 25:43.042
- ( walkie static hisses )
- Wade: All right, that's it.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.645
Time to go home.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.211
Cam got a boo-boo.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.124
Man on radio:
Are you sure?

25:48.280 --> 25:52.205
Wade: Oh, yeah. He only wanted
to take this so far.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.802
And he only wants ass
that's willing, you know?

25:55.960 --> 25:58.566
( Sobbing )

26:01.440 --> 26:04.125
Come on, Cam.
Let's walk it off.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.164
We thought
you were with them.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.129
We knock you over the head,
tie you up,

26:25.280 --> 26:27.248
threaten to kill you...

26:28.680 --> 26:30.682
why the hell
did you come back?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.763
( Grunting )
I don't know.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.168
Maybe I'm stupid, too.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.008
( Birds chirping )

26:52.360 --> 26:56.160
(gun clicking)

27:10.960 --> 27:13.486
(growling )

27:48.000 --> 27:50.685
Well, howdy, gentlemen.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.204
( Growling continues )

28:05.360 --> 28:08.682
( metal creaking )

28:08.840 --> 28:10.842
( clattering )

28:26.400 --> 28:28.129
RPG.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.362
( Metal creaking )

29:26.800 --> 29:30.361
( roaring )

30:12.960 --> 30:14.644
( chuckles )

30:27.520 --> 30:28.931
( match strikes )

30:43.520 --> 30:46.171
- ( snarling )
- ( flesh squelching )

30:46.360 --> 30:48.601
( metal groaning )

31:02.720 --> 31:04.290
( Splats )

31:22.720 --> 31:25.724
(walker snarling,
thudding )

31:27.720 --> 31:29.961
Sasha:
Where do you get that?

31:30.120 --> 31:35.889
It is the fruit
of some off-the-chart stupidity.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.562
Some grade-A,
butt steak idiocy.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.770
Self-awareness
is a beautiful thing.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.769
Yes, it is.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.844
You see,
I know this group

31:50.000 --> 31:52.162
and I know Rick.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.368
And whatever happened
back there is being managed

31:54.520 --> 31:58.241
and kicked right up into its own ass
one way or another. I know that.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.324
We got beer...

32:03.520 --> 32:05.921
and air conditioning...

32:07.760 --> 32:09.171
and walls.

32:10.600 --> 32:14.446
The table is set
for the rest of our lives,

32:14.600 --> 32:17.922
and I hope those years
to be long and fruitful.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.122
I see that time before me...

32:22.360 --> 32:25.170
and I've been feeling the urge
to make some plays...

32:26.560 --> 32:30.406
...before the great cosmic Pete comes
to cut my throat unceremoniously

32:30.560 --> 32:33.928
and I gurgle my last breath.

32:34.080 --> 32:37.607
Well, things are gonna go on
for a while before that,

32:37.760 --> 32:40.570
and that hadn't
occurred to me before.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.405
I've been kind of living
check to check on that point.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.643
I like the way
you call bullshit, Sasha.

32:50.800 --> 32:54.122
I believe I'd like to get to know you
a whole lot better.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.084
( Chuckles )

33:00.240 --> 33:02.402
That one of your plays?

33:06.960 --> 33:11.010
What makes you think
I want that?

33:15.240 --> 33:17.686
A man can tell.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.968
( laughs )

33:22.520 --> 33:24.010
Well...

33:26.680 --> 33:29.684
( chuckles ) ...you got some stuff
to take care of.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.930
Yeah.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.923
I do.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.443
Daryl:
So you know 'em?

33:50.600 --> 33:52.045
Still you thought
I was one of them?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.362
Where we were--
we were there since the beginning.

33:54.520 --> 33:55.885
We still didn't know everyone.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.806
Back when we first threw in with them,
it was as good as a place as any.

33:59.960 --> 34:02.804
Then things got harder,
people got harder.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.121
Human nature kicked in

34:04.280 --> 34:08.170
and it became a truly unique
kind of shitshow.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.051
People will trade
anything for safety,

34:11.199 --> 34:12.565
for knowing that they're safe.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.563
Everything.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.563
So they got nothing left
except just...

34:17.719 --> 34:19.324
existing.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.005
Hey, nobody's safe anymore.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.407
Can't promise people that anyhow.

34:24.560 --> 34:27.040
You could promise the people
who want to hear it.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.922
Hey, Tina, hold up.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.321
Carla and Delly.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.569
That's them.

34:52.239 --> 34:56.768
Honey: Me and Tina used to babysit them
when they were kids.

34:56.920 --> 35:00.447
Everyone said that they went out north
when it all started.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.125
We didn't know.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.361
I did this.

35:13.760 --> 35:15.922
We did this.

35:36.080 --> 35:39.129
- ( Growling )
- ( screaming )

35:46.320 --> 35:49.767
- ( screaming )
- ( sobbing )

35:49.920 --> 35:52.571
- I'm sorry!
'(coughs)

35:52.720 --> 35:55.849
I'm so sorry, baby.
We had to try.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.162
We had to try.
We had to.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.005
( Honey sobbing )
I'm so sorry.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.164
I'm sorry.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.004
I'm...

36:22.360 --> 36:24.089
<i>He'! '</i>

36:26.200 --> 36:28.009
How many walkers
you killed?

36:30.360 --> 36:33.762
- Just answer the question.
- A lot.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.769
A couple dozen at least.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.167
How many people you killed?

36:38.320 --> 36:40.527
None.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.444
Why?

36:45.360 --> 36:48.125
Why haven't I killed anybody?

36:48.280 --> 36:51.887
Because if I did,
there'd be no going back.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.131
There'd be no going back
to how things were.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.803
I'm from a place

36:59.960 --> 37:03.248
where people are
still like they were...

37:03.400 --> 37:06.882
more or less,
better or worse.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.482
I can walk it from here.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.206
Till we meet up with my friends.
( grunts )

37:30.360 --> 37:33.204
They got a car.
You can ride with them.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.771
How many friends
you say there were?

37:34.920 --> 37:38.447
I didn't.
There's two of 'em.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.841
Where are they?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.526
We're gonna find out.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.445
How do you know they even got away?
That they didn't get taken?

37:46.600 --> 37:48.568
I don't.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.247
- ( Hammer clicks )
- Oh, damn it.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.409
I'm sorry.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.929
Give her the crossbow.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.367
You gonna go back?

38:16.560 --> 38:18.369
- You gonna be safe?
- Shut up.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.130
Ain't nowhere safe no more.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.930
Give her the crossbow.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.287
You gonna kneel?

38:24.440 --> 38:26.044
(gunshot)

38:52.240 --> 38:54.163
( engine starts )

38:57.160 --> 38:59.003
Patch yourself up.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.760
We're sorry.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.684
You're gonna be.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.282
( Growling softly )

40:38.360 --> 40:41.125
(growling )

40:51.680 --> 40:53.284
( growling stops )

40:57.120 --> 40:59.282
- ( walker growling )
- Look at this.

41:04.640 --> 41:05.880
What?

41:08.480 --> 41:10.960
Nothing.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.805
( Truck approaches )

41:16.640 --> 41:18.642
( truck engine stops )

41:20.560 --> 41:22.801
( chuckles )

41:59.840 --> 42:01.842
Rick, you COPY?

42:02.000 --> 42:03.809
( Static hissing )

42:03.960 --> 42:05.769
Daryl:
Anybody?

42:05.960 --> 42:08.201
( Static hissing )

42:08.360 --> 42:10.522
( garbled voice over radio )

42:10.680 --> 42:12.364
Daryl:
Say it again?

42:12.520 --> 42:14.841
( Static hissing )

42:15.000 --> 42:16.365
Man on walkie:
Help.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.602
( Static hissing )

42:22.000 --> 42:25.004
( theme music playing )
