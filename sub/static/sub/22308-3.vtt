WEBVTT

00:01.016 --> 00:02.484
I think she's
pretty damn fabulous.

00:02.519 --> 00:04.720
There's a severe lack of detail.

00:04.754 --> 00:06.822
This works very well.
I congratulate you.

00:06.856 --> 00:08.423
Huge honor.
Thank you.

00:08.458 --> 00:10.726
Previously,
three <i>Face Off</i> champions

00:10.760 --> 00:12.494
led their teams of five artists

00:12.529 --> 00:14.663
through a challenge
of astronomical proportions.

00:14.697 --> 00:15.998
Whoo!

00:16.032 --> 00:17.199
Team Rayce dominated,

00:17.233 --> 00:18.734
and Logan's
magnificent sculptures

00:18.768 --> 00:21.169
- gave him his first win.
- Thank you.

00:21.204 --> 00:22.738
But Gregory's monkey fell short,

00:22.772 --> 00:27.442
and Team Laura
lost its first member.

00:27.477 --> 00:29.711
Now 14 artists remain,

00:29.746 --> 00:33.081
and tonight they battle
to win a monstrous challenge.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.350
We want to be really
frightened by these creatures.

00:35.385 --> 00:37.753
I'm screaming and jumping
up and down, "Yay!"

00:37.787 --> 00:39.388
Watch your nose.

00:39.422 --> 00:41.823
The pressure is on as one of
the world's biggest movie stars

00:41.858 --> 00:44.760
joins this weeks panel,
Josh Hutcherson.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.995
The concept feels cohesive.

00:47.030 --> 00:49.231
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

00:49.265 --> 00:50.799
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

00:50.833 --> 00:53.869
to one of their
85 international locations,

00:53.903 --> 00:56.605
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:56.639 --> 01:00.342
and $100,000.

01:00.376 --> 01:02.377
This is <i> Face Off.</i>

01:05.480 --> 01:08.450

01:44.787 --> 01:45.988
Oh, my God,
what are we doing here?

01:46.022 --> 01:47.255
What is this?

01:47.290 --> 01:48.824
We're at this large
empty stadium.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.592
I hope this isn't
a football challenge.

01:50.627 --> 01:52.928
It's like being
in the Roman Colosseum.

01:52.962 --> 01:54.796
Feel like a gladiator
walking in for battle.

01:54.831 --> 01:56.164
If we're gonna have
to fight to the death,

01:56.199 --> 01:57.432
I call dibs on the ax.

01:57.467 --> 01:58.767
[Laughter]

01:58.801 --> 02:00.702
- Who... Is that Glenn?
- Ve and Glenn.

02:00.737 --> 02:02.671
I see Ve Neill and Glenn Hetrick

02:02.705 --> 02:03.905
standing there with McKenzie

02:03.940 --> 02:07.209
and all of these flowers
and these gold emblems.

02:07.243 --> 02:09.610
Is it what
I think it's gonna be?

02:09.645 --> 02:11.480
- Hey, guys.
All: - Hi.

02:11.514 --> 02:15.384
Welcome to the Historic
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum,

02:15.418 --> 02:17.753
a national landmark
that has hosted

02:17.787 --> 02:20.589
some of the largest
sporting events in the world,

02:20.623 --> 02:24.226
including Super Bowl VII,
the 1959 World Series,

02:24.260 --> 02:29.031
and the 1932
and 1984 Olympic Games.

02:29.065 --> 02:32.267
This week's challenge is
inspired by sporting events

02:32.301 --> 02:36.271
that aren't always
fun and games.

02:36.305 --> 02:38.907
Films like <i>The Hunger Games</i>
and <i>The Running Man</i>

02:38.941 --> 02:41.510
feature deadly competitions
wherein game engineers

02:41.544 --> 02:43.612
forced participants
to fight for their lives,

02:43.646 --> 02:46.148
fending off everything
from their fellow competitors

02:46.182 --> 02:48.884
to vicious animals
and poisonous plants.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.552
So, for your next
spotlight challenge,

02:50.586 --> 02:53.355
you will play the role
of an evil game engineer

02:53.389 --> 02:55.924
and create your very own
deadly predator.

02:55.958 --> 02:58.460
[Laughter]

02:58.494 --> 03:01.630
I'm pumped.
I like gnarly beasts.

03:01.664 --> 03:05.033
I like to make them mean
and just nasty.

03:05.068 --> 03:08.503
Now, in order to make
these designs truly unstoppable,

03:08.538 --> 03:10.172
you must incorporate
the elements

03:10.206 --> 03:13.842
of a deadly animal
and an exotic plant.

03:13.876 --> 03:15.844
Each of these plants is paired

03:15.878 --> 03:18.480
with the emblem
of a deadly animal.

03:18.514 --> 03:22.751
Working in teams of two,
you'll choose a plant and animal

03:22.785 --> 03:27.122
and use their exotic features to
inspire your deadly predators.

03:27.156 --> 03:28.690
That's cool.

03:28.725 --> 03:30.225
Your teams have been
randomly assigned.

03:30.259 --> 03:32.728
Kelly and Daniel.

03:32.762 --> 03:34.229
Ben and Darla.

03:34.263 --> 03:36.865
Julian and Adam.

03:36.899 --> 03:39.067
Anthony and Logan.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.069
Emily and Regina.

03:41.104 --> 03:43.338
Stephanie and Alan.

03:43.372 --> 03:45.273
Rob and Jamie.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.809
Go ahead and stand
with your new teammates.

03:47.844 --> 03:50.746
Let's go.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.614
Kelly and Daniel,
you're up first.

03:52.648 --> 03:55.150
- Wanna go with the scorpion?
- Yes.

03:55.184 --> 03:58.754
Kelly and Daniel, you picked
the scorpion and delphinium.

03:58.788 --> 04:03.592
Ben and Darla,
you picked the ram and cactus.

04:03.626 --> 04:04.793
Julian and Adam,

04:04.827 --> 04:07.562
you have the bat
and the sugarbush protea.

04:07.597 --> 04:10.332
- Go get that pig.
- Anthony and Logan,

04:10.366 --> 04:12.868
you have the warthog
and the American pitcher plant.

04:12.902 --> 04:17.539
Emily and Regina, you have
the hyena and shampoo ginger.

04:17.572 --> 04:19.040
Stephanie and Alan,

04:19.075 --> 04:22.077
you picked the thorny dragon
and the cockscomb.

04:22.111 --> 04:25.747
Rob and Jamie, you have
the piranha and blue thistle.

04:25.782 --> 04:27.149
All right, now you worked on

04:27.183 --> 04:28.583
<i>The Hunger Games</i> films together,

04:28.618 --> 04:30.452
so your creations
helped the franchise

04:30.486 --> 04:32.554
become a worldwide phenomenon.

04:32.588 --> 04:34.589
Now, it's not easy to combine

04:34.624 --> 04:36.091
the features of a plant
and an animal,

04:36.125 --> 04:38.026
so what advice do you have
in order for them

04:38.060 --> 04:40.462
to make their creatures
cohesive?

04:40.496 --> 04:41.930
In <i>The Hunger Games,</i>

04:41.964 --> 04:44.566
the games makers created deadly
hybrids that were called mutts.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.902
They were not cute.
They were not funny.

04:46.936 --> 04:48.503
They were deadly killers.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.939
We want to be really frightened
by these creatures.

04:50.973 --> 04:53.141
And also, I don't want
to see someone

04:53.176 --> 04:54.509
with a flower around their head.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.511
Create your own
predator creature,

04:56.546 --> 04:59.648
and integrate elements
from your plant and your animal.

04:59.682 --> 05:01.483
Thank you, guys.

05:01.517 --> 05:03.585
Now before I send you off
to work on your designs,

05:03.619 --> 05:06.888
I have a big announcement
to make.

05:06.923 --> 05:08.623
Oh, God.

05:08.658 --> 05:11.793
One of the stars
of <i>The Hunger Games</i> franchise

05:11.828 --> 05:14.930
will be joining us
onstage this week.

05:14.964 --> 05:18.900
He has won all kinds of awards
for his role in the films,

05:18.935 --> 05:22.204
including MTV Movie Awards,
Teen Choice Awards,

05:22.238 --> 05:25.240
and The People's Choice Award.

05:25.274 --> 05:29.511
Peeta himself, Josh Hutcherson.

05:29.545 --> 05:32.981
The inner fan girl nerd
is just, like, screaming

05:33.015 --> 05:36.852
and jumping up and down, "Yay,
we get to meet Josh Hutcherson!"

05:36.886 --> 05:38.320
I'm such a huge fan of him.

05:38.354 --> 05:42.591
He is such a sweet guy,
an amazing young actor,

05:42.625 --> 05:44.326
and he is a huge fan
of <i> Face Off,</i>

05:44.360 --> 05:46.361
so I'm very excited
Josh is joining us.

05:46.395 --> 05:48.430
- I like him even more now.
- Yeah.

05:48.464 --> 05:51.700
All right, it's time to start
working on your designs.

05:51.734 --> 05:54.169
- Good luck, everyone.
- Good luck, guys.

05:58.741 --> 06:01.142
I'm really excited
about this challenge.

06:01.177 --> 06:03.712
The fact that these are all
genetically modified creatures,

06:03.746 --> 06:05.080
you can really do
a lot with that

06:05.114 --> 06:07.849
and make things
really terrifying.

06:07.884 --> 06:09.885
We need to bulk out
the shoulders.

06:09.919 --> 06:11.386
Our concept
is going to be this ram

06:11.420 --> 06:14.055
that's got cactus spikes
coming out of his head.

06:14.090 --> 06:16.491
He hangs around dark crevices,

06:16.525 --> 06:17.759
and he's there
just to pummel you.

06:17.793 --> 06:19.761
Are the horns gonna
attach to the cowl?

06:19.795 --> 06:22.264
- Yeah.
- Okay, I like that.

06:25.334 --> 06:27.135
With the texture from the plant

06:27.169 --> 06:28.703
and color from the hyena.

06:28.738 --> 06:31.973
I like the idea of it
blending into its surroundings,

06:32.008 --> 06:34.175
so it would be the form
of the hyena

06:34.210 --> 06:36.912
- and then just layering it.
- Yeah, no, I totally get it.

06:36.946 --> 06:39.547
We come up with a predator
that incorporates

06:39.582 --> 06:43.418
scaling of the plant to blend
into its surroundings,

06:43.452 --> 06:45.820
and I really like the idea
because nothing's scarier

06:45.855 --> 06:48.523
than something that's hiding
in plain sight.

06:48.557 --> 06:51.126
- Can I sculpt the face?
- Yeah.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.761
Okay.

06:56.299 --> 06:59.167
It's a human genetic hybrid,
so it's made to be a warrior.

06:59.201 --> 07:01.736
Our plant is
the sugarbush protea

07:01.771 --> 07:03.305
and our animal is the bat.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.273
- Want to do a chest piece?
- I don't think we should.

07:05.308 --> 07:06.975
I think we should
focus on things

07:07.009 --> 07:08.610
that are going to give us
a strong silhouette.

07:08.644 --> 07:12.814
Adam sketches this very
humanoid-looking bat,

07:12.848 --> 07:17.319
so the batty nose, batty mouth,
it looks really badass,

07:17.353 --> 07:19.854
and I think it's gonna kill it.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.897
Like Gill-man features, but
then we'll do the piranha jaw.

07:28.931 --> 07:30.532
My partner is Jamie,
which is fantastic,

07:30.566 --> 07:32.200
because she's really talented
and we have a lot in common.

07:32.234 --> 07:33.702
Do you want to do
a body piece, too?

07:33.736 --> 07:35.203
Yeah, that would be perfect.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.471
Our concept is to make

07:36.505 --> 07:38.440
a more modernized version
of the Gill-man.

07:38.474 --> 07:40.275
I want to incorporate
piranha teeth

07:40.309 --> 07:42.377
with armor around the eyes,
and then the blue thistle,

07:42.411 --> 07:43.912
I want to bring it
up from the teeth

07:43.946 --> 07:45.847
to where it actually looks like
it's growing out

07:45.881 --> 07:48.283
of the Gill-man itself.

07:48.317 --> 07:51.052
All right, everybody.
Let's go back to the lab.

07:51.087 --> 07:53.254
I'm really, really excited
for this challenge.

07:53.289 --> 07:57.325
Alan and I are ready to bring
our deadly predator to life.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.462
This is exciting.

08:07.136 --> 08:08.770
We have 5 1/2 hours in the lab,

08:08.804 --> 08:11.973
and the first thing that we do
is pick our models

08:12.008 --> 08:15.744
and start sculpting right away.

08:15.778 --> 08:18.380
Me and Logan are the warthog
and the American pitcher plant

08:18.414 --> 08:20.648
and we decided
that this character

08:20.683 --> 08:23.752
is this gigantic
monster creature

08:23.786 --> 08:25.854
with this open, rotting flesh
that resembles

08:25.888 --> 08:28.089
that resembles
the American pitcher plant.

08:28.124 --> 08:29.591
Dude, I'm excited.
This is fun.

08:29.625 --> 08:32.027
- I am too.
- Anthony starts on the face,

08:32.061 --> 08:35.563
I start on the cowl, and since
the boar's nostrils are so big,

08:35.597 --> 08:37.698
we use them as eyeholes,

08:37.732 --> 08:40.235
so that gives us
a different shape

08:40.269 --> 08:45.340
that is distinctly less human
and more boar-like.

08:49.245 --> 08:51.112
Hey, guys.

08:51.147 --> 08:54.382
We have a hyena, and we have
the shampoo ginger.

08:54.417 --> 08:55.917
Whose is this?
Is this yours?

08:55.951 --> 08:57.419
- Yeah, it's mine.
- Oh, that's a good sketch.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.320
I haven't seen
a lot of things like that,

08:59.355 --> 09:01.990
and I know the judges are
looking for something unique.

09:02.024 --> 09:05.160
Emily is on my team,
and Regina is on Rayce's team.

09:05.194 --> 09:07.162
Love the concept,
and I'm looking forward

09:07.196 --> 09:10.065
to working with the other
coaches on this challenge.

09:10.099 --> 09:12.734
This is the one I've seen
that's the most unexpected.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.941
Definitely you guys
are working to think about

09:19.975 --> 09:22.177
ways of incorporating this
even more.

09:22.211 --> 09:23.845
- For sure.
- So that way you're not

09:23.879 --> 09:25.747
just sculpting
a literal translation of...

09:25.781 --> 09:27.949
Both: - The lizard.
- Yeah.

09:27.983 --> 09:30.718
Stephanie and I get the thorny
dragon and the cockscomb.

09:30.753 --> 09:33.888
And our concept is
this dragon character

09:33.923 --> 09:38.026
that's very spiked out and
has a hand base like a lizard

09:38.060 --> 09:40.995
but has very vibrant reds,
greens, and pinks

09:41.030 --> 09:42.997
to represent
the cockscomb flower.

09:43.032 --> 09:47.202
Stephanie is sculpting the face,
and I am sculpting the cowl,

09:47.236 --> 09:48.636
and I'm feeling really good.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.039
That kind of shape might be
kind of cool to put into here,

09:51.073 --> 09:54.876
- for, like, venom glands.
- Ooh, I do like that.

09:58.581 --> 10:01.683
I think I don't wanna go
too bulky away from the face

10:01.717 --> 10:03.718
because that might have been
our mistake last time.

10:03.752 --> 10:06.421
My partner is Daniel.
We're both on Anthony's team,

10:06.455 --> 10:08.156
and, last challenge,
Daniel and I

10:08.190 --> 10:10.758
ended up being
one of the bottom looks,

10:10.793 --> 10:13.128
so we have something
to prove this time.

10:13.162 --> 10:16.598
We have the scorpion
and the delphinium.

10:16.632 --> 10:20.301
We're gonna combine
the hard shell of the scorpion

10:20.336 --> 10:23.471
but still have the forms
of the petals of the flower

10:23.506 --> 10:26.741
in a gladiator helmet
that's part of her.

10:26.775 --> 10:28.610
She is her own armor.

10:28.644 --> 10:31.246
Wanna extend the armor
down to the nose?

10:31.280 --> 10:34.182
Yeah, I think that's cool.

10:40.356 --> 10:41.623
What do you think?

10:41.657 --> 10:42.891
I think one design

10:42.925 --> 10:46.027
looks very feminine,
and one reads more menacing.

10:46.061 --> 10:47.729
The face is half-sculpted,

10:47.763 --> 10:51.032
and I look over at Regina's cowl
and it's not matching up.

10:51.066 --> 10:53.735
So you can kinda get...

10:53.769 --> 10:56.204
It just doesn't look like
they would fit together.

10:56.238 --> 11:00.141
- Maybe keep it very uniform.
- I'm really confused,

11:00.176 --> 11:03.545
because I'm doing my part
to replicate the original idea,

11:03.579 --> 11:06.848
but I feel like my direction is
not the same direction as hers.

11:06.882 --> 11:08.416
I don't want to sculpt
and then change it

11:08.450 --> 11:09.951
and just eat the rest
of the time.

11:09.985 --> 11:11.519
Because we're already
eating into our time.

11:11.554 --> 11:12.820
I'm freaking out.

11:12.855 --> 11:14.556
Emily and I keep on
going back and forth,

11:14.590 --> 11:16.991
and we're losing so much time.

11:17.026 --> 11:18.393
What do you want me
to change on it?

11:18.427 --> 11:20.028
So I know what I can do.

11:20.062 --> 11:23.464
This isn't gonna work out.

11:27.793 --> 11:30.261
I need a direction where
to go, and I'll follow it.

11:30.296 --> 11:32.497
Today's the first day
of our predator challenge.

11:32.531 --> 11:33.932
There's two hours
left in the day,

11:33.966 --> 11:37.168
and we still don't have
a clear idea of what we want.

11:37.203 --> 11:38.336
So what do you want to do?

11:38.370 --> 11:40.972
I think we should change
the concept.

11:41.006 --> 11:43.808
Ultimately, Regina and I
decided to scrap the face.

11:43.842 --> 11:46.611
There's still time to catch up
to everyone, okay?

11:46.645 --> 11:49.380
Gina and Emily,
they've lost a lot of time.

11:49.415 --> 11:51.649
Every decision they make
from here on out

11:51.684 --> 11:54.185
has to be perfect, otherwise
they're going to be in trouble.

11:54.220 --> 11:56.087
These things have to scare
the pants off ya,

11:56.121 --> 11:59.390
so create that powerful feeling,
that could be your ticket.

12:06.332 --> 12:09.000
- Hi, everybody.
All: - Hi.

12:09.034 --> 12:11.002
Our initial idea was doing,
like, a four-legged bat,

12:11.036 --> 12:13.671
but it was a little ambitious
for just the two of us.

12:13.706 --> 12:15.073
In looking at the face,

12:15.107 --> 12:17.008
I like the way you're tying
all this into it.

12:17.042 --> 12:19.410
I mean, your plant
works really well,

12:19.445 --> 12:22.580
but it's a nose
we've seen a thousand times.

12:22.615 --> 12:24.549
Maybe open the nostrils
a little more, flare them,

12:24.583 --> 12:28.786
just to give us another little
bit of bat type of look.

12:28.821 --> 12:29.988
Our animal is the ram,

12:30.022 --> 12:32.457
and the cactus is...
what we're gonna do

12:32.491 --> 12:35.059
is end up putting
probably some spikes.

12:35.094 --> 12:36.961
- I love it.
- Awesome.

12:36.996 --> 12:38.363
It's a really unique concept.

12:38.397 --> 12:39.697
Let's see the face.

12:39.732 --> 12:41.599
I'm bringing in some
of the features of the ram

12:41.634 --> 12:43.534
but making it
a little more demon-like

12:43.569 --> 12:45.003
but keeping those eyes human.

12:45.037 --> 12:46.771
When you put the human eyes
in there...

12:46.805 --> 12:48.373
Do you think it will just
take away from it?

12:48.407 --> 12:49.774
Take away from it,

12:49.808 --> 12:50.775
make it look like somebody
that's wearing a mask.

12:50.809 --> 12:52.343
Okay.

12:52.378 --> 12:56.381
So we had a shampoo ginger
plant and a hyena.

12:56.415 --> 12:57.749
Now, you're going
with a hyena face.

12:57.783 --> 12:59.217
Mm-hmm.

12:59.251 --> 13:01.786
- I see literally nothing there.
- I'm still working on that.

13:01.820 --> 13:03.588
Okay.
Let's see your cowl.

13:03.622 --> 13:06.357
This is reading
like you've made a flower

13:06.392 --> 13:08.893
and you're forgetting
your animal.

13:08.927 --> 13:11.062
Your creature has to be scary.

13:11.096 --> 13:13.665
So keep that in mind
as you're working on this.

13:13.699 --> 13:14.866
- Okay?
- Okay.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.735
We have the piranha
and the blue thistle.

13:17.770 --> 13:20.805
Seems like you're doing
a very literal face on here.

13:20.839 --> 13:23.808
In the nose area,
maybe do something interesting,

13:23.842 --> 13:25.710
add a little bit
of thistle into it.

13:25.744 --> 13:28.246
And that would take it away
from holding a picture

13:28.280 --> 13:29.547
and going, "Oh, my God.
It's a piranha."

13:29.581 --> 13:31.316
So maybe put some nostrils
down in here, then, or...

13:31.350 --> 13:32.684
- You could, yeah.
- Okay.

13:32.718 --> 13:34.852
Mr. Westmore's a legend
in the effects world,

13:34.887 --> 13:36.621
and he knows what
the judges want,

13:36.655 --> 13:39.424
so we know we have
to take his advice seriously.

13:39.458 --> 13:40.792
Good luck to everybody.

13:40.826 --> 13:42.760
- Bye.
- Thank you.

13:50.903 --> 13:53.504
Okay, everybody, that's time.

13:53.539 --> 13:57.075
By the end of day one,
I'm really stressed.

13:57.109 --> 14:01.446
We have a face and a cowl
that still needs help.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.816
So Regina and I have
a lot of work to do tomorrow.

14:10.155 --> 14:13.057
- Let's go.
- Good morning.

14:13.092 --> 14:14.859
Today is day two at the lab,

14:14.893 --> 14:18.396
and Kelly and I need
to finish our sculptures,

14:18.430 --> 14:21.666
make the molds, and be ready
to run this thing.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.868
Wow.
I'm real excited.

14:26.921 --> 14:28.606
That is scary.

14:33.846 --> 14:36.547
Just gonna go over
and brush out all of this stuff.

14:36.582 --> 14:37.982
The first thing
that me and Logan do,

14:38.016 --> 14:41.753
we go to our sculptures to
finish the rest of our details.

14:41.787 --> 14:43.821
Right now, this area's
still very friendly.

14:43.856 --> 14:46.391
I would really suggest
looking at gravity

14:46.425 --> 14:48.826
and how it would affect
this guy's mouth.

14:48.861 --> 14:52.697
I have never sculpted
any face piece this big before.

14:52.731 --> 14:55.767
And I'm having a hard time,
so Logan jumps in

14:55.801 --> 14:57.602
and starts putting on this lip

14:57.636 --> 14:59.337
that sticks out
a little bit more,

14:59.371 --> 15:01.072
and the silhouette
that it's adding

15:01.106 --> 15:03.107
definitely is
a little bit better.

15:03.142 --> 15:04.470
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

15:08.113 --> 15:10.281
- Sculpt's looking good.
- Thanks, dude.

15:10.315 --> 15:13.117
I get my sculpts to a place
where I'm very happy,

15:13.152 --> 15:16.554
and I take it to the mold room.

15:16.588 --> 15:18.856
I'm the first one molding,
so it feels good.

15:18.891 --> 15:20.658
At this point,
I'm feeling like Adam and I have

15:20.692 --> 15:23.628
a really good handle
on our time management.

15:23.662 --> 15:25.129
I like that.

15:25.164 --> 15:28.433
Emily and I talked last night
and changed our concept.

15:28.467 --> 15:30.601
We've decided that I'm going
to sculpt the face,

15:30.636 --> 15:32.069
she's going to sculpt the cowl.

15:32.104 --> 15:33.738
Regina wants to bring the mohawk

15:33.772 --> 15:36.808
- down the middle, like the front.
- Oh, cool.

15:36.842 --> 15:39.844
So we're taking the scaling
from the shampoo ginger plant

15:39.878 --> 15:41.913
and having the silhouette
of a hyena.

15:41.947 --> 15:43.114
It's sneaky, it's creepy,

15:43.148 --> 15:45.149
and it's a different
kind of predator.

15:45.184 --> 15:46.851
Looking around,
we're very behind.

15:46.885 --> 15:48.653
I'm feeling
really nervous about it.

15:48.687 --> 15:50.388
It's intimidating.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.360
So some of the important details

15:56.395 --> 15:58.129
that I'm working on on the cowl

15:58.163 --> 16:00.231
are separation
between the horn and the skin.

16:00.265 --> 16:03.868
So if you come around in here,
it breaks the surface.

16:03.902 --> 16:08.272
It looks more like one piece of
flesh that's being integrated.

16:08.307 --> 16:09.807
Anthony gives me
some real good advice

16:09.842 --> 16:11.209
on how to build up details,

16:11.243 --> 16:13.678
to really give it
that human, creepy feel.

16:13.712 --> 16:16.247
This is cool, guys.

16:18.851 --> 16:20.218
Yay.

16:20.252 --> 16:22.520
While Alan is molding the face,

16:22.554 --> 16:24.021
I'm looking at the cowl.

16:24.056 --> 16:26.724
I'm getting a little bit worried
that we may not be doing enough.

16:26.758 --> 16:30.161
Whenever something is really
hard next to soft tissue,

16:30.195 --> 16:31.629
there's going to be a wrinkle.

16:31.663 --> 16:33.998
Laura's helping give the cowl
some secondary form

16:34.032 --> 16:35.633
to make it
a lot more interesting.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.635
But we're already too far
into day two.

16:37.669 --> 16:40.738
We can't really make any
dramatic changes to our concept.

16:40.772 --> 16:41.939
Much better.

16:41.974 --> 16:44.909
This needs to get molded
right now.

16:52.017 --> 16:54.585
I get a little lost
sculpting the cowl,

16:54.620 --> 16:56.687
and I realize
I took way too much time.

16:56.722 --> 16:58.089
You got it?

16:58.123 --> 16:59.724
In the back of my head,
I'm like,

16:59.758 --> 17:01.092
"Get to the mold room,
get to the mold room,

17:01.126 --> 17:04.395
you need to get there now!"

17:04.429 --> 17:07.064
We have three hours
to finish the mold,

17:07.098 --> 17:09.867
and the big issue that we have
is the cowl.

17:09.902 --> 17:13.104
Has a lot of details that make
it very complicated to mold.

17:13.137 --> 17:15.006
Ooh, shit.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.375
I'm freaking out.
This is the most detailed

17:17.409 --> 17:19.410
and hardest mold I've ever done.

17:19.444 --> 17:20.978
And I have to prevent anything
from happening

17:21.012 --> 17:22.512
like what happened last week.

17:22.548 --> 17:25.950
We don't have enough plaster
bandage to even do the job.

17:25.983 --> 17:29.987
After being bottom looks,
I don't want to be there again.

17:34.189 --> 17:35.723
It's day two in the lab,

17:35.757 --> 17:38.225
and our challenge this time
is to make a deadly predator.

17:38.260 --> 17:40.461
I wanted to get this done
a while ago.

17:40.495 --> 17:42.463
I don't want to rush the mold

17:42.497 --> 17:46.701
and risk ruining all the detail
in my sculpture.

17:46.735 --> 17:49.003
Don't worry.
We're gonna do it.

17:49.037 --> 17:52.239
Kelly's freaking out, so I'm
trying to make her feel better.

17:52.274 --> 17:53.808
We'll be good.

17:53.842 --> 17:57.278
I'm not worrying about it.
We're going to get this done.

18:04.486 --> 18:06.587
So I start cutting out leaves
that will create

18:06.621 --> 18:08.689
the rest of the head form
on the cowl,

18:08.724 --> 18:10.858
and I take the dremel tool,
and I just start adding

18:10.892 --> 18:13.494
a basic texture to it.

18:13.528 --> 18:16.263
- I start coating those in latex.
- That's very cool, bro.

18:16.298 --> 18:21.168
- Want me to get one?
- No, I got it.

18:21.203 --> 18:24.071
Because we only have
a face and a cowl,

18:24.106 --> 18:26.841
we need something to give it
that hyena quality

18:26.875 --> 18:29.076
and something that brings it
to the next level.

18:29.111 --> 18:31.045
I see the hemp in the mold room,

18:31.079 --> 18:33.247
and I figure that
this could work as hair,

18:33.281 --> 18:35.816
so I take acrylic paints
with a little bit of water

18:35.851 --> 18:37.651
and I mix hemp with it,

18:37.686 --> 18:38.853
then I lay them out to dry,

18:38.887 --> 18:40.988
so I have
all different shades of brown.

18:41.022 --> 18:43.124
Color done.

18:47.162 --> 18:49.430
Time's running out,
and we want to incorporate

18:49.464 --> 18:52.733
the leaf aspect of
the blue thistle to our makeup.

18:52.768 --> 18:56.270
So I grab a piece of L200,
I draw the pattern,

18:56.304 --> 18:57.605
I cut out around the shape,

18:57.639 --> 18:59.740
and then I form it
to the bust that we have.

18:59.775 --> 19:01.509
The leaves are going
to fit in there perfectly,

19:01.543 --> 19:03.210
like they're growing
out of the head,

19:03.245 --> 19:06.180
almost like dreadlocks.

19:09.284 --> 19:11.152
It's getting
towards the end of the day,

19:11.186 --> 19:13.053
and I start prying
this cowl mold apart,

19:13.088 --> 19:15.422
and, luckily,
the back half pops right off.

19:15.457 --> 19:16.891
But now I gotta
get the head out,

19:16.925 --> 19:18.526
and Darla comes
running in to help,

19:18.560 --> 19:20.594
because we need to get this
thing open as fast as we can

19:20.629 --> 19:23.798
- so we can clean it out.
- There's just a lot of suction.

19:23.832 --> 19:26.066
It's taking a lot longer
than we want to,

19:26.101 --> 19:29.665
but not having this cowl
tomorrow is not an option.

19:32.541 --> 19:35.009
We finally get the core out
of the second half of the mold,

19:35.043 --> 19:36.844
but we're not going to have
enough time

19:36.878 --> 19:38.212
to clean it out properly,

19:38.246 --> 19:41.882
which means that we could have
an unusable foam piece.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.712
That's time!

19:45.854 --> 19:47.988
We're both a little scared.

19:48.023 --> 19:50.224
It was so rushed
trying to get that done.

19:50.258 --> 19:52.092
So we're keeping
our fingers crossed,

19:52.127 --> 19:54.528
but we know that
if we have any issues

19:54.563 --> 19:58.232
we're just going to have
to use what we got.

20:09.878 --> 20:11.345
It's application day.

20:11.379 --> 20:12.613
We have four hours in the lab

20:12.647 --> 20:13.948
and one hour of last looks.

20:13.982 --> 20:17.351
- Ooh, this is rough.
- The cowl is not too bad,

20:17.385 --> 20:19.486
but it's got excess foam
all over it,

20:19.521 --> 20:22.389
so I grab a razor,
start cutting this thing off,

20:22.424 --> 20:24.758
start making it look pretty.
Nose isn't too bad.

20:24.793 --> 20:27.228
Overall, it came out nice.

20:30.866 --> 20:33.400
Uh-oh.
Ooh.

20:33.435 --> 20:36.270
Our foam piece
is a pretty big mess.

20:36.304 --> 20:38.305
It's like rubber.
Like sawed rubber.

20:38.340 --> 20:40.507
And that's really bad,
because we're going to be

20:40.542 --> 20:42.409
spending most of the day
patching it.

20:42.444 --> 20:47.414
Let me get my scissors
and start cutting the seam.

20:47.449 --> 20:51.218
Mmm, the smell of foam latex
in the morning.

20:52.754 --> 20:54.755
- Hey, how's it going?
- This is you today.

20:54.789 --> 20:56.523
- Regina.
- Nice to meet you.

20:56.558 --> 20:59.827
My plan is to fabricate
the chest piece and back piece,

20:59.861 --> 21:02.663
and Regina is applying
the makeup,

21:02.697 --> 21:04.565
and then we'll both work
together on painting it.

21:04.599 --> 21:06.700
I'm going to take the hemp
and start layering it.

21:06.735 --> 21:09.169
Today is going to be
a crazy day.

21:09.204 --> 21:11.071
Don't let me slow you down.

21:11.106 --> 21:12.706
- Lean your head back.
- Mm-hmm.

21:12.741 --> 21:16.277
- There you go.
- Watch your nose.

21:16.311 --> 21:20.581
Ben and I put the cowl on
our model, and it's way too big.

21:20.615 --> 21:22.449
It's just another thing
that sets us back

21:22.484 --> 21:25.619
because we have to cut away
all the excess to make it fit.

21:25.654 --> 21:26.921
I'll cut this at a bevel.

21:26.955 --> 21:28.856
This way, you can taper it in
a little bit more.

21:28.890 --> 21:30.891
All right.

21:42.187 --> 21:44.338
Oh, my God,
it's gonna be so awesome.

21:44.372 --> 21:45.806
I'm so pumped!

21:49.311 --> 21:50.811
What do you want to base it as?

21:50.845 --> 21:52.146
Like a muted green.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.882
Our paint scheme is inspired
by the sugarbush protea.

21:54.916 --> 21:56.951
Green is not something
I'm used to using.

21:56.985 --> 21:59.119
I think we can go
a little bit darker with it.

21:59.154 --> 22:02.122
I'm just hoping it looks
natural and realistic.

22:05.293 --> 22:07.962
So you don't have
any brushstrokes.

22:07.996 --> 22:10.197
If you take a watered-down
white or cream color

22:10.231 --> 22:13.801
and speckle that,
it'll push all those veins back.

22:13.835 --> 22:15.058
Okay.

22:17.138 --> 22:19.440
We start painting,
and we know immediately

22:19.474 --> 22:21.008
that this is going
to take a long time.

22:21.042 --> 22:22.676
We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

22:22.711 --> 22:25.279
Anthony and Logan right now,
they're moving pretty slow.

22:25.313 --> 22:27.681
And I'm worried
about the paint job,

22:27.716 --> 22:30.384
because they have
a pretty intense cowl.

22:30.418 --> 22:34.088
I just hope they can finish.

22:38.426 --> 22:40.561
When everything's done
with some black,

22:40.595 --> 22:42.997
hit inside these holes,
even create a couple more,

22:43.031 --> 22:46.300
just to kind of
take your eyes off those.

22:46.334 --> 22:48.302
You're starting
on the detail painting,

22:48.336 --> 22:49.770
but you still have
a lot of patchwork.

22:49.804 --> 22:54.041
The edges on Alan and
Stephanie's face aren't perfect.

22:54.075 --> 22:56.276
There's an edge there.

22:56.311 --> 22:57.911
Get those all squared away

22:57.946 --> 22:59.480
before you start airbrushing.

22:59.514 --> 23:01.048
There is so much
paint work to do

23:01.082 --> 23:03.550
on top of all of the patching.

23:03.585 --> 23:04.685
They may run out of time.

23:04.719 --> 23:06.531
Ten minutes, everybody.

23:08.423 --> 23:10.244
You guys gotta close your kits.

23:11.926 --> 23:15.262
Are you gonna bring out
more highlights in the face?

23:15.296 --> 23:18.065
We're running out of time, and
we don't have any hair on it,

23:18.099 --> 23:19.833
and it's really dark right now.

23:19.868 --> 23:21.068
We need to lighten up the face,

23:21.102 --> 23:24.304
so it doesn't get
washed out onstage.

23:24.339 --> 23:25.539
That's time!

23:25.573 --> 23:27.541
At this point,
it would be a miracle

23:27.575 --> 23:30.010
if this makeup is safe.

23:38.098 --> 23:39.498
Let's do this.

23:39.532 --> 23:42.067
It's last looks.
Me and Logan have one hour left.

23:42.102 --> 23:44.236
And we immediately
start painting

23:44.270 --> 23:47.773
like there's no tomorrow.

23:47.807 --> 23:50.242
My sole job
is to lay all the hair,

23:50.276 --> 23:54.012
but it's not hair, it's hemp,
so I use hot give

23:54.047 --> 23:56.281
to create beads
on the end of the hemp,

23:56.316 --> 24:02.654
so the latex of the cowl
has something to adhere to.

24:02.689 --> 24:04.289
This is the fun part.

24:04.324 --> 24:07.059
Jamie starts gluing the teeth
in, it's a scary piece,

24:07.093 --> 24:09.428
and Jamie and I
are just ecstatic

24:17.203 --> 24:19.338

very important,

24:19.372 --> 24:21.173

a little too yellow,

33:44.188 --> 33:46.490
and really fantastic-looking.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.024
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:48.059 --> 33:51.928
The concept feels cohesive,
as, like, this hybrid animal.

33:51.963 --> 33:54.264
And I like how the chest comes
out like the ribcage of a hyena.

33:54.298 --> 33:56.800
And, also, she looks like she
really enjoys being a predator.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.268
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:58.302 --> 34:00.770
No question, this is a
beautiful character head to toe.

34:00.805 --> 34:03.306
The silhouette is marvelous.

34:03.341 --> 34:06.209
The use of the hemp is so smart.

34:06.244 --> 34:09.012
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

34:09.045 --> 34:11.047
Emily and Regina,
if you'd please step back.

34:16.654 --> 34:19.222
Julian and Adam, you're next.

34:24.594 --> 34:26.730
Tell me about
your plant/animal choice

34:26.764 --> 34:28.632
and who did what
on this creation.

34:28.666 --> 34:32.335
We got a bat
and a sugarbush protea.

34:32.370 --> 34:35.739
I drew a concept of
a sleek bat assassin warrior.

34:35.773 --> 34:38.174
I sculpted the cowl

34:38.208 --> 34:41.777
and fabricated the pieces on
the back as well as the arms.

34:41.812 --> 34:45.382
Julian sculpted the face, and
we both tackled the paint job,

34:45.416 --> 34:47.551
and we both did
a lot of the detailing.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.655
Looks like a psychedelic
artichoke with a bat face on it.

34:51.688 --> 34:54.391
I think there's a little bit
too much plant in it for me,

34:54.425 --> 34:56.592
and if you wouldn't have
painted him lime green,

34:56.627 --> 34:58.628
I think he would have been
much scarier-looking,

34:58.663 --> 35:01.298
'cause the face is really good.

35:01.332 --> 35:04.367
You have so much of the plant
already in the shape of the head

35:04.402 --> 35:06.202
and the shape of the back
of the head and the arms,

35:06.237 --> 35:07.971
that I think you maybe
could have gone

35:08.005 --> 35:09.539
darker with the color
on the face

35:09.574 --> 35:12.142
to get more of the bat involved.

35:12.176 --> 35:14.244
Thank you, guys.
Please step back.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.513
Thanks.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.084
All right,
let's talk to Ben and Darla.

35:21.118 --> 35:23.219
Please step to the center.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.159
Could you tell us what your
creature and your plant were

35:29.193 --> 35:31.261
and kind of who did what
on the sculpture?

35:31.295 --> 35:33.563
We had the ram and the cactus.

35:33.598 --> 35:37.133
I primarily sculpted the face.
Ben primarily sculpted the cowl.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.369
Ben did a lot of the ridge work,
and then I went through

35:39.403 --> 35:43.273
and did the striations
along all the horns.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.376
- I think it's so cool.
- Thanks.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.645
Looking into that face,
the darkness of the eyes

35:48.679 --> 35:50.213
and then all the shapes
coming out,

35:50.247 --> 35:52.148
the technique on it
and the coloration,

35:52.183 --> 35:56.353
the painting, everything is
so demonic ram-cactusy.

35:56.387 --> 35:58.788
It's pretty awesome.
I'm a big fan, for sure, yeah.

35:58.823 --> 36:02.192
This is my favorite makeup
I've seen on <i>Face Off.</i>

36:02.226 --> 36:03.460
Wow.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.161
You've done some things here
with the forms

36:05.196 --> 36:08.231
that could so easily
have gone south on you.

36:08.265 --> 36:09.966
- I'm so impressed.
Both: - Thank you.

36:10.001 --> 36:14.070
This thing scares
the heck out of me.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.372
He looks like something
that's been

36:15.406 --> 36:16.706
out in the desert for years,

36:16.741 --> 36:21.611
- and that paint job is awesome.
- Thank you so much.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.713
Ben and Darla,
if you'd please step back.

36:29.553 --> 36:32.756
Stephanie and Alan,
please step forward.

36:36.661 --> 36:39.663
So tell us
about your plant/animal fusion

36:39.697 --> 36:41.264
and the division of labor.

36:41.298 --> 36:44.801
Our inspiration was
the thorny dragon and cockscomb.

36:44.835 --> 36:47.303
He's supposed to be
a stealth predator and venomous,

36:47.338 --> 36:49.105
that's the saliva,

36:49.140 --> 36:51.608
and all the horns are actually
protruding venom.

36:51.642 --> 36:54.110
Stephanie sculpted the face,
I sculpted the cowl,

36:54.145 --> 36:55.612
she detailed the face,

36:55.646 --> 36:58.014
and then we both shared
the labor on the paint.

36:58.049 --> 37:04.587
It's too soft
and too devoid of texture.

37:04.622 --> 37:07.957
The masseter muscle
on the maxilla and mandible

37:07.992 --> 37:11.761
feel goitrous
more than it does powerful.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.263
- Yeah, right in here?
- Yeah.

37:13.297 --> 37:15.098
Yeah, I was trying to go
for a venom sac.

37:15.132 --> 37:17.167
Okay, that explains it,
because that does feel

37:17.201 --> 37:19.235
completely incongruous
to the rest of it,

37:19.270 --> 37:21.971
but knowing that that probably
is the venom sac versus a muscle

37:22.006 --> 37:24.774
is a good idea,
just not well-executed.

37:24.809 --> 37:30.080
It's got almost an anime
cartoon aesthetic to it,

37:30.114 --> 37:33.316
and that lends to
an unfortunate lack of ferocity,

37:33.350 --> 37:35.485
which is what
we were looking for.

37:35.519 --> 37:38.722
The fact that you made him
all yellow makes him not scary.

37:38.756 --> 37:42.692
He just looks like
a little kid's candy pop.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.694
Thank you both.
If you'd please step back.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.469
Thank you, guys.

37:52.503 --> 37:53.970
Please head back
to the makeup room

37:54.004 --> 37:56.372
while the judges deliberate.

38:01.879 --> 38:04.514
All right, judges,
let's start with your favorites.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.783
How about
Regina and Emily's work?

38:06.817 --> 38:08.885
Totally put together well.

38:08.919 --> 38:11.654
Loved the hemp fibers
and the little grass treatments.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.890
She was mean, sleek.

38:13.924 --> 38:15.391
Because of also
the smaller model,

38:15.426 --> 38:16.593
the proportions were great.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.895
They did a great job
of striking that balance

38:18.929 --> 38:21.030
of finding notes that say hyena

38:21.065 --> 38:25.168
without directly putting hyena
anatomy onto a person's face.

38:25.202 --> 38:26.770
I'm thrilled
with their approach.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.938
All right, let's move on
to Ben and Darla.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.774
I thought the face
was really great.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.675
That thing was
so realistic-looking.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.845
It had that dried out,
skeletal effect.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.614
It was almost like a ghost ram.

38:37.648 --> 38:41.451
Ben's sculpture of the cowl,
that back view...

38:41.485 --> 38:43.486
- Oh, yeah.
- Is so gorgeous.

38:43.521 --> 38:45.722
All right, judges,
let's move on to the makeups

38:45.756 --> 38:48.658
that didn't quite work
so well this week.

38:48.692 --> 38:50.727
Why don't we start
with Julian and Adam?

38:50.761 --> 38:52.829
The bat and the sugarbush.

38:52.863 --> 38:55.198
They did exactly what
we told them not to do.

38:55.232 --> 38:58.802
They did a bat face with
the artichoke head in the back.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.537
The color really killed them.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.005
I think what you're saying
is absolutely right.

39:02.039 --> 39:03.373
If you had put
some more darkness into it,

39:03.407 --> 39:04.574
made it look a little more evil,

39:04.608 --> 39:05.942
that would have really done
a lot for me.

39:05.976 --> 39:08.211
All right, let's move on
to Stephanie and Alan.

39:08.245 --> 39:09.612
It wasn't scary-looking.

39:09.647 --> 39:11.214
It was like
a little kid's lollipop.

39:11.248 --> 39:14.017
It was just too sweet.
It was yellow...

39:14.051 --> 39:15.785
And you know what else,
I think it was a mistake

39:15.820 --> 39:19.389
that Alan put those pouches,
those goitery-looking things.

39:19.423 --> 39:21.291
Like, to add on,
like, venom sacs,

39:21.325 --> 39:22.392
you got to make 'em venom sacs

39:22.426 --> 39:24.561
and not blobule jowls.

39:24.595 --> 39:26.429
All right, judges,
have you made up your minds?

39:26.463 --> 39:27.764
- Yep.
- We're there.

39:27.798 --> 39:29.699
Okay, let's bring them back out.

39:38.075 --> 39:40.476
Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.712
Emily and Regina,

39:42.746 --> 39:44.914
between the super cool
facial shapes

39:44.949 --> 39:46.549
and all the fabrication,

39:46.584 --> 39:48.651
your character
really came together.

39:48.686 --> 39:52.055
Ben and Darla,
we were all taken aback

39:52.089 --> 39:55.091
by your bold concepts
and incredible shapes.

39:55.125 --> 39:57.327
Okay, which team
came out on top?

39:57.361 --> 39:58.728
Our top team tonight is...

39:58.762 --> 40:01.731
[Dramatic music]

40:01.765 --> 40:03.066
♪ ♪

40:05.591 --> 40:07.225
Okay, which team
came out on top?

40:07.259 --> 40:12.430
Our top team tonight is...

40:12.464 --> 40:15.032
Ben and Darla.

40:15.067 --> 40:18.769
[Applause]

40:18.804 --> 40:21.606
This is one of the most
incredible concepts

40:21.640 --> 40:23.074
that we have ever seen
on the show.

40:23.108 --> 40:25.710
There were such clever nods
to the forms

40:25.744 --> 40:28.246
of both your animal
and your plant.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.281
- Amazing.
Both: - Thank you.

40:30.315 --> 40:32.116
Ben and Darla, excellent work,

40:32.151 --> 40:34.152
but as you know,
we can only have one winner.

40:34.186 --> 40:37.955
- Glenn?
- Tonight's winner is...

40:37.990 --> 40:39.790
- Ben.
- Nice.

40:39.825 --> 40:42.827
[Applause]

40:42.861 --> 40:45.163
That cowl
was just awe-inspiring.

40:45.197 --> 40:47.231
I made a promise to myself

40:47.266 --> 40:49.233
that if I ever won
a spotlight challenge,

40:49.268 --> 40:50.968
that I'd propose
to my girlfriend.

40:51.003 --> 40:56.407
So, Stephanie Rae Goreman,
will you marry me?

40:56.441 --> 40:57.608
Ben, congratulations,

40:57.643 --> 40:59.677
and congratulations to you
as well, Anthony.

40:59.711 --> 41:00.778
Thank you.

41:00.812 --> 41:03.447
All right, Ben, Darla,
Emily, and Regina,

41:03.482 --> 41:04.882
you're all safe
and can head back

41:04.917 --> 41:06.884
to the makeup room
with your coaches.

41:13.192 --> 41:14.892
All right, guys,
that means the rest of you

41:14.927 --> 41:18.296
are on the bottom this week, and
one of you will be going home.

41:18.330 --> 41:20.831
Please step forward.

41:27.839 --> 41:30.675
Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom teams.

41:30.709 --> 41:34.378
Julian and Adam, while we
thought the face was menacing,

41:34.413 --> 41:36.948
the paint job
undermined your character.

41:36.982 --> 41:38.749
Stephanie and Alan.

41:38.784 --> 41:41.786
While the sweeping shapes
of the face and the cowl

41:41.820 --> 41:44.121
were really cool,
the light color palette

41:44.156 --> 41:46.657
made him feel friendly
instead of scary.

41:46.692 --> 41:48.626
So who is going home tonight?

41:48.660 --> 41:50.261
The person
going home tonight is...

41:50.295 --> 41:53.998
[Dramatic music]

41:54.032 --> 41:57.201
Alan.
Such a tough night.

41:57.236 --> 42:01.239
None of the makeups were bad,
but ultimately the venom sac

42:01.273 --> 42:04.542
negatively affected
the appeal of your character.

42:04.576 --> 42:06.144
Alan, I'm so sorry,

42:06.178 --> 42:08.479
but that means
you have been eliminated.

42:08.514 --> 42:11.616
Julian, Adam, Stephanie,
you are safe this week.

42:11.650 --> 42:13.918
You can head back
to the makeup room.

42:18.123 --> 42:19.791
[Sighs]

42:19.825 --> 42:20.892
I've been there before, too,
man.

42:20.926 --> 42:22.360
So many times in auditions,

42:22.394 --> 42:24.629
I've been told "Believe in
yourself" and then get told no,

42:24.663 --> 42:26.197
it's the hardest thing
in the world,

42:26.231 --> 42:27.665
but you're an artist,
and you're gonna keep at it.

42:27.700 --> 42:29.300
Thank you very much
for your honest opinions.

42:29.335 --> 42:32.370
I want you to go out of here
with your head held high, man.

42:32.404 --> 42:35.139
Alan, if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

42:35.174 --> 42:36.908
- and pack up your kit.
- See you later, guys.

42:36.942 --> 42:38.176
- Good luck, dude.
- Good luck, honey.

42:38.210 --> 42:40.244
- Bye, Al.
- It's hard to leave now,

42:40.279 --> 42:42.880
making it only this far.

42:42.915 --> 42:44.615
I have no regrets.

42:44.650 --> 42:46.384
I've gotten
a lot of experiences,

42:46.418 --> 42:47.552
I've made a lot of new friends.

42:47.586 --> 42:49.354
Hey, thanks for picking me.

42:49.388 --> 42:50.855
Glad I picked you.

42:50.889 --> 42:53.391
I've grown quite a bit as
an artist in this competition.

42:53.425 --> 42:54.826
And I'm going to continue
to do makeup

42:54.860 --> 42:56.260
till I can't do it no more.
