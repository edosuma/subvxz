A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:31.583 --> 00:32.416
Sergio.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.333
Did you stay up late studying again?

00:41.583 --> 00:42.541
Come downstairs.

00:43.666 --> 00:45.500
We're waiting for you to eat breakfast.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.833
Tatiana is here.

01:04.958 --> 01:06.041
Good morning.

01:10.041 --> 01:11.708
Prince Hamlet.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.375
May I introduce you to Tatiana?

01:19.750 --> 01:20.583
Hello...

01:21.041 --> 01:22.166
It's a pleasure.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.666
Isn't she the most beautiful woman
in the world?

01:26.666 --> 01:28.250
Really? I didn't know!

01:28.333 --> 01:30.416
What do you do?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.458
I'm a concert pianist.

01:32.541 --> 01:35.125
Soloist of... classic piano?

01:35.208 --> 01:37.958
Yes, Schumann, Chopin, Bach.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.333
-She has heavenly fingers.
-For piano...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
and for robbery.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.041
Excuse me.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.166
She's a thief and a good one.

01:47.250 --> 01:50.125
Piano and jewels are my two specialties.

01:50.208 --> 01:53.250
By the way, she loves the idea
of the Bank of Spain's robbery.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.791
She knows.

02:00.083 --> 02:01.750
-She knows?
-Yes.

02:01.833 --> 02:03.708
There are no secrets between us.

02:03.791 --> 02:08.458
Actually, she likes it better
than yours at the Royal Mint.

02:12.416 --> 02:14.916
Can we take a minute to talk...
in private?

02:15.708 --> 02:16.750
Are you crazy?

02:16.833 --> 02:17.833
That may be.

02:17.916 --> 02:19.375
Andrés, what's going to happen

02:19.458 --> 02:22.833
once they offer a million dollar reward
for any information?

02:22.916 --> 02:25.125
With a job like this,
it will surely happen.

02:25.208 --> 02:27.041
-Don't go there.
-What?

02:27.125 --> 02:29.750
You're insinuating that the love
of my life is going to betray me.

02:29.833 --> 02:32.333
I'm not insinuating it, I'm saying it.

02:33.916 --> 02:36.500
But, okay, let's believe in true love...

02:36.625 --> 02:38.291
-Fuck!
-Let's go inside.

02:38.375 --> 02:41.708
You were saying, "Let's believe
in true love," and I say, "Of course."

02:41.791 --> 02:43.708
Yes, let's assume Tatiana
won't sell you out.

02:43.791 --> 02:45.041
Listen to me!

02:45.125 --> 02:46.416
She's a thief.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.750
What if she has to choose between
ratting you out or going to jail?

02:50.833 --> 02:53.416
It's so easy to talk about love
when you've never known it.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.375
I'm being objective, my perspective
isn't deformed by sentimentality.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.583
Let me tell you something about Tatiana.

02:58.666 --> 03:01.041
I've traveled around Europe opening safes
with her,

03:01.125 --> 03:04.083
and you know robberies are tense affairs.
There is always conflict.

03:04.166 --> 03:05.750
"You didn't place the explosives right."

03:05.833 --> 03:09.583
"Where are the diamond bits?" It's normal
to blame any mistake on the other.

03:09.666 --> 03:11.750
But with her, that doesn't happen.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.958
It doesn't. It's like walking on clouds.

03:14.041 --> 03:17.541
We've spent 14 hours in a stinky basement
to open a hole in the wall.

03:17.625 --> 03:20.166
And we made love
as if there was no tomorrow.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.625
Couples fight when they go to Marbella
on holiday,

03:23.708 --> 03:27.541
we robbed Crédit Agricole and it felt
as if we were on our honeymoon.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.208
You felt the same
the other four times you married.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.666
That was a low blow.

03:32.750 --> 03:36.125
Low and despicable, it doesn't do you
justice as a brother or a man.

03:42.458 --> 03:43.958
-Good morning, Giovanni.
-Good morning.

03:44.416 --> 03:45.458
Good morning.

03:47.041 --> 03:50.041
You allow two monks to get to the kitchen,
and you have the plans on the walls!

03:50.125 --> 03:53.000
Please, they call me Mr. Engineer.

03:53.083 --> 03:55.583
They think we're academics, not robbers.
Why are you so pessimistic?

03:58.583 --> 04:01.125
How long have you known her?
Tatiana. How long?

04:01.208 --> 04:03.291
Why does it matter? Love can't be timed!

04:04.083 --> 04:05.250
Love is to be lived.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.583
No. You can't risk
the whole plan for a woman.

04:07.875 --> 04:11.583
That's the first rule.
Andrés, the first rule:

04:11.666 --> 04:14.666
"The plan can't be poisoned by
an amorous relationship. Never."

04:14.750 --> 04:15.708
Never.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.375
It's not so difficult to understand.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.833
It's seven p.m. We have to make a call.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.083
Can you call Palermo, please?

04:36.416 --> 04:37.708
Palermo. Situation?

04:37.791 --> 04:39.416
We've already done ten tons.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.708
It's 10,700 kilograms turned into grains.

04:41.791 --> 04:43.208
Two percent more than planned.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.791
Breaking records, Professor.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.250
<i>Like Usain Bolt.</i>

04:46.333 --> 04:47.333
And the defenses?

04:47.916 --> 04:50.208
We're still welding. We have two for now.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.791
<i>Any news?</i>

04:51.875 --> 04:53.708
Everything's in control here. There?

04:54.541 --> 04:55.916
No complications.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Over and out.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.333
Break into the bank. Don't doubt it.

05:03.166 --> 05:05.041
We're evaluating risks.

05:08.916 --> 05:09.958
Luis, look at me.

05:13.083 --> 05:16.875
I have a pill box on my nightstand
with pills of every color.

05:17.541 --> 05:19.625
I feel weird if I am not wearing pajamas.

05:19.875 --> 05:22.458
For two years,
I have had erectile dysfunction

05:22.541 --> 05:24.791
because of those fuckers.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.250
Post-traumatic stress.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.583
What you have to do is stop coming here.

05:30.666 --> 05:34.250
Go with Merche to your hometown,
rest and take care of yourself.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.708
And don't turn the fucking TV on.

05:36.791 --> 05:38.833
Luis, don't make the same mistake I did.

05:39.833 --> 05:43.083
If you have to drop a 20-megaton bomb
on them, you do it!

05:43.166 --> 05:45.583
Just do it!
Don't be afraid of the consequences!

05:46.208 --> 05:47.416
That's better

05:47.500 --> 05:50.583
than dropping small shitty bombs
every two hours.

05:51.583 --> 05:52.875
Because these fuckers,

05:52.958 --> 05:55.541
if you aren't forceful,
they'll shit all over you.

05:55.625 --> 05:59.583
They can shit on me as long as they want,
as long as they don't reveal state secrets.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.083
If we break into the bank, Alfonso,

06:02.375 --> 06:04.500
we will all end up in court.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.083
Or something worse.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.083
What do we do then?

06:08.875 --> 06:11.875
Should we sit back and watch,
as if we were tied down?

06:12.333 --> 06:14.583
If they have that advantage,
we neutralize it.

06:16.458 --> 06:19.583
Do people know what those secrets are?

06:20.125 --> 06:22.250
No! Not even God knows.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.875
Well, Intelligence knows those secrets.

06:26.291 --> 06:28.541
What paper is used, what stamp.

06:28.625 --> 06:29.875
Wonderful.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.291
Let's fabricate our own secrets.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.791
Let's contaminate the editorial offices
of all the newspapers and TV networks

06:38.875 --> 06:40.583
in this country,
as the Professor would do.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.208
Sierra, please, what you're...

06:42.291 --> 06:45.166
Superintendents bought by drug dealers,
ministers accepting bribes,

06:45.250 --> 06:46.375
orgies...

06:46.458 --> 06:49.041
paid with the cooperation's funds. All in.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.250
What the fuck are you saying?
Listen to me.

06:51.333 --> 06:54.875
We can't do that,
we would destroy the system's credibility.

06:54.958 --> 06:57.375
Police, politics, institutions...
Everything!

06:57.458 --> 06:59.291
No! The media...

06:59.375 --> 07:01.541
they'll start to verify the information.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.750
And everyone will have an alibi.
Where was whatshisname? In his hometown!

07:04.833 --> 07:06.125
For fuck's sake! Where else?

07:06.208 --> 07:08.000
And the Minister?
In a meeting in Brussels.

07:08.833 --> 07:11.708
And once the Professor, our dear shepherd,

07:11.791 --> 07:13.791
publishes the real state secrets...

07:14.250 --> 07:17.500
not even God will be able
to tell the lies from the truth.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.083
We would have deactivated
the ace up their sleeve.

07:20.166 --> 07:21.958
And do you know what's best of all?

07:22.041 --> 07:26.000
That by the time he tries to recover,
we'll have gotten in and out of the bank.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.125
That, I swear to you.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.750
DAY 2

08:49.083 --> 08:50.166
Are you all right?

08:50.875 --> 08:52.500
My stomach hurts.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.333
From being shot.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.125
Here.

08:57.541 --> 09:00.000
It's hard, because of the impact.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.791
Poor you.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.208
And I'm constipated.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.791
With this situation, you can imagine.

09:12.791 --> 09:13.708
Of course.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.750
Can you pass me the coffee, please?

09:16.833 --> 09:18.000
Come here.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.125
Me?

09:19.541 --> 09:22.291
Yes, you. Of course. Who else?
Stand up and come here.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.208
Come with me.

09:30.666 --> 09:32.333
I can t believe it!

09:32.416 --> 09:34.291
Go, go!

09:34.375 --> 09:35.958
What the fuck are you doing?

09:36.041 --> 09:36.875
I'm sorry!

09:39.708 --> 09:42.041
Did you try to flirt with that girl
by talking about poop?

09:42.125 --> 09:44.958
I was just saying my tummy aches
because of the gases.

09:45.041 --> 09:46.458
What an idiot!

09:47.250 --> 09:49.291
Okay, okay. Listen to me.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.916
Do you like that girl?

09:53.541 --> 09:54.375
Yes.

09:54.958 --> 09:56.875
-I like her very much.
-Very much.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.833
Very much. Did you think...

09:58.916 --> 10:00.708
that talking about being constipated,

10:00.791 --> 10:02.416
about your fucking bowel obstruction,

10:02.500 --> 10:04.625
was a good way to seduce her?

10:04.708 --> 10:06.125
Listen to me. You have to...

10:06.208 --> 10:08.291
From now on, you're a fucking hero.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.000
A fucking hero. Nothing hurts you.

10:11.083 --> 10:13.083
You are going to give her
your food ration every day.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.625
Every one of them.

10:14.833 --> 10:17.500
And if I get cocky,
you're going stand up to me.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.250
Starting now. Stand up to me.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.291
Stand up to me, fuck!

10:21.375 --> 10:22.208
Yes, sir!

10:31.125 --> 10:32.000
I'm sorry.

10:35.041 --> 10:35.958
For what I did.

10:36.375 --> 10:39.791
For shooting you in the vest.
I was having a tough time.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.208
Don't worry, Mr. Denver.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.041
I know these things happen
during robberies.

10:50.125 --> 10:51.916
It isn't easy, Miguel. It isn't.

10:54.666 --> 10:55.833
But let me tell you something.

10:56.875 --> 10:57.708
I know...

10:59.000 --> 11:00.583
that with my intelligence

11:02.291 --> 11:06.250
and that roguish smile you have,
that tenderness,

11:07.041 --> 11:08.791
you're going to win Amanda over.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.250
Am I right? You are much better up close.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.666
Well, I do what I can, Mr. Denver.

11:13.750 --> 11:14.625
Of course.

11:16.583 --> 11:17.750
Now, go to the toilet

11:17.833 --> 11:20.583
and don't come out
until you're done pooping. Go.

11:32.541 --> 11:33.541
Mr. Denver.

11:34.375 --> 11:35.375
What's up?

11:35.458 --> 11:37.833
If you're there, I can't concentrate.

11:43.625 --> 11:47.000
<i>We interrupt this program.</i>
<i>The biggest secret filtration</i>

11:47.083 --> 11:48.916
<i>has just happened</i>
<i>in the history of our country.</i>

11:49.000 --> 11:52.791
<i>This newspaper has had access</i>
<i>to more than 100 classified documents.</i>

11:52.875 --> 11:54.416
<i>Spain sold cluster bombs</i>

11:54.500 --> 11:57.708
<i>to Saddam Hussein six months</i>
<i>before Iraq's invasion.</i>

11:57.791 --> 12:00.291
<i>It's one of the CNI's files.</i>

12:00.375 --> 12:04.500
<i>A massive leak of the secrets</i>
<i>that were kept in the Bank of Spain.</i>

12:04.583 --> 12:06.666
-All digital media.
-Those secrets are fake.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.875
They're neutralizing the best bargaining
chip we have to negotiate for Rio.

12:09.958 --> 12:10.791
That's not it.

12:12.791 --> 12:14.750
They're knocking down our shield.
They're going in.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.666
Of course, Mr. Minister.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.250
Gentlemen, we have a green light
from the prime minister.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.291
Formation!

12:21.375 --> 12:24.041
We're going to inject gas
at an extraordinary pressure.

12:24.125 --> 12:26.708
Halothane, highly narcotic.

12:26.791 --> 12:29.041
In 30 minutes,
they should all be unconscious,

12:29.125 --> 12:32.000
but be ready to face any kind of surprise.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.416
Palermo, do you copy me?

12:33.500 --> 12:34.791
<i>I'm listening, Professor.</i>

12:34.875 --> 12:38.416
<i>They're going in. I need you to gather</i>
<i>everyone. I repeat, they're going in.</i>

12:38.500 --> 12:39.750
When? What kind of attack?

12:39.833 --> 12:41.541
I don't know yet. Keep in contact.

12:41.625 --> 12:42.541
Marseilles.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.750
They're going in.
We need to know through where.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.833
Report on any kind of movement.

12:46.916 --> 12:49.166
We need to get off the regional road.
Find another route.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.291
In 300 meters, turn left.

12:53.958 --> 12:54.791
Dirt road.

12:54.875 --> 12:55.833
What's going on?

12:55.916 --> 12:58.125
We passed that car 90 kilometers ago
yesterday.

13:03.166 --> 13:04.208
Are you sure it's the same one?

13:04.291 --> 13:06.791
M5354XX. It's the same!

13:06.875 --> 13:08.041
Don't talk to me like that!

13:08.125 --> 13:10.000
-Not now, please.
-Never!

13:17.875 --> 13:18.791
The antenna, fuck!

13:19.375 --> 13:22.333
Palermo! Palermo, do you copy?

13:30.250 --> 13:31.958
It's stuck. We need to get it out.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.750
Start the car!

13:43.708 --> 13:44.875
No!

13:45.916 --> 13:47.875
Look, Dad!

13:47.958 --> 13:49.083
It's the Professor!

13:53.666 --> 13:57.541
Dad! It's... the Professor! The Professor!

14:06.916 --> 14:08.583
And the Inspector!

14:16.500 --> 14:18.166
Yes, that's right, I'm...

14:18.958 --> 14:21.125
the Professor, and she's...

14:21.541 --> 14:22.708
the Inspector.

14:22.791 --> 14:23.625
Lisbon.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.458
No zeppelins have flown over here.

14:32.541 --> 14:33.458
No.

14:33.541 --> 14:37.250
What? Do you need help to get
the van out of the mud?

14:38.000 --> 14:38.958
Come on!

14:39.041 --> 14:41.541
Come on, we can do it in a minute!

14:41.625 --> 14:42.833
Come on! Come on!

14:42.916 --> 14:45.416
Come on.
Wait for her to get into the van. Wait.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.375
Come on, let's get into position.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.583
Come on!

14:48.666 --> 14:49.875
Push! Push!

14:49.958 --> 14:50.791
Come on!

14:50.875 --> 14:52.166
We're close!

14:56.083 --> 14:58.500
Come on! Push!

15:00.750 --> 15:02.041
Come on!

15:06.750 --> 15:08.041
Something weird is going on.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.750
I thought they were hostages.

15:10.083 --> 15:10.916
Boy!

15:12.166 --> 15:13.666
Weren't you a hostage?

15:14.958 --> 15:17.041
They hired me, okay?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.291
Now, everyone shut the fuck up!

15:22.166 --> 15:24.041
Ladies and gentlemen, they're coming in.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.916
And we all know what that means.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.666
I would love to have more information.
Sadly, we don't.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.416
So we only have one option left.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.125
To use violence as a dissuasive method.

15:35.625 --> 15:36.458
What?

15:38.166 --> 15:41.708
The first armored car we see,
we will fire at them,

15:41.791 --> 15:43.541
so they will back down.

15:45.208 --> 15:46.500
Is that what the Professor said?

15:46.583 --> 15:48.333
We've lost contact with the Professor.

15:48.416 --> 15:51.375
And I don't know if it's a technical
problem or something worse.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.500
The thing is that we're alone.

15:54.916 --> 15:56.666
And I'm in charge now.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.958
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.958
We don't know how they'll enter...

16:04.375 --> 16:06.166
or if they'll use armored cars.

16:06.250 --> 16:09.416
Will they lower themselves from
the ceiling or come out of the sewers?

16:11.208 --> 16:12.083
Tell me.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.666
Where the fuck are you going
to launch those missiles?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.041
Did we lose our minds or what?

16:23.375 --> 16:24.833
Guys, fuck, don't.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.083
Our people are out there.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.916
We got in here by throwing money.

16:31.583 --> 16:32.666
Not bombs.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.375
That would never be one
of the Professor's strategies.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.666
He would try to buy time.

16:39.250 --> 16:43.041
So Miss Trigger-Happy
now proposes to buy time. Funny.

16:44.458 --> 16:45.916
Do you know what I think, Tokyo?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.208
What do you think?

16:47.291 --> 16:51.166
You know that if we use the anti-tanks,
they won't give you Rio back.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.500
They will burn us with napalm.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.875
What the fuck is up with you?

16:57.958 --> 17:00.166
Come on. Wake up! Fuck!

17:03.125 --> 17:04.416
-I'm sorry.
-No.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.458
I'm sorry.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.708
We already discussed this, Tokyo.

17:08.791 --> 17:09.708
Love.

17:11.041 --> 17:13.166
I'm sorry for your romance,

17:14.833 --> 17:16.416
but it's time to defend ourselves.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.166
Bogotá.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.750
This one.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.625
There's no time! Hurry up!

17:24.708 --> 17:25.791
-Come on.
-Yes.

17:31.125 --> 17:35.000
Stop that nonsense, girl.
Now this is the only friend you have.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.958
-Where is everyone else?
-I think...

17:57.041 --> 17:59.875
This needs a little more oil.

18:01.291 --> 18:02.958
No, don't shoot. Please!

18:03.625 --> 18:05.375
He's from the gang, yes! He is.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.666
Cincinnati is part of the gang.

18:07.750 --> 18:08.625
He didn't kill me!

18:08.708 --> 18:09.750
Don't kill dad!

18:09.833 --> 18:11.250
-Kill policemen.
-No!

18:11.333 --> 18:13.458
It's a guitar. How do you play a guitar?

18:13.541 --> 18:14.625
A guitar!

18:15.166 --> 18:16.000
Yes.

18:21.666 --> 18:22.666
Yes. It's a guitar.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.125
No.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.166
Listen to me.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.875
What you're thinking right now, forget it.

18:31.750 --> 18:34.208
What? Do you read minds?

18:34.750 --> 18:36.708
I don't need to read minds, love.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.291
From the moment we came here,

18:39.375 --> 18:43.166
you've been guilt-tripping yourself.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.083
Stop that right now.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.958
You were all so fucking happy.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.333
Swimming in money, and now here you are.

18:51.416 --> 18:53.958
It's normal to give myself a guilt-trip
sometimes, isn't it?

18:54.041 --> 18:56.291
I'm going to tell you one thing.

18:56.916 --> 19:00.708
And you're going to brand it
on your pretty forehead.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.833
You're a free woman.

19:05.083 --> 19:08.166
You're free to go to a party,
you're free to leave an island,

19:08.250 --> 19:10.916
and you're free to leave
the planet if you want.

19:11.875 --> 19:12.916
Understood?

19:14.250 --> 19:16.000
Do you know who fucked it up first?

19:16.625 --> 19:17.708
The Professor.

19:17.916 --> 19:19.750
Yes. One doesn't need
to know you very well

19:19.833 --> 19:22.041
to know you can't stand living
on a desert island.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.000
What are you now? Bin Laden?

19:24.083 --> 19:26.583
Are you? No, you're Tokyo.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.541
And the second one who fucked up was Rio.

19:29.125 --> 19:32.166
He bought the phones.
He couldn't help it and he called you.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.083
But do you know what matters the most?

19:36.166 --> 19:39.666
We aren't here to do you a favor.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.833
Look at this big birthday cake.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.125
We're here because
we're adrenaline junkies.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.666
We're adrenaline junkies!

19:48.750 --> 19:51.833
So stop looking at Cincinnati
as if he is an orphan.

19:51.916 --> 19:54.166
No, stop that, and let's enjoy ourselves!

19:54.250 --> 19:57.000
Because this is a party.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.041
Party time, sister.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.208
Bravo!

20:14.291 --> 20:15.375
Everyone to the table!

20:21.291 --> 20:23.458
What the fuck is this?

20:23.541 --> 20:25.250
-Artichokes.
-Artichokes?

20:25.666 --> 20:27.416
There wasn't any alfalfa left?

20:27.500 --> 20:30.583
Come on, the monks gave us a lot
of vegetables, so grilled vegetables!

20:30.666 --> 20:34.166
And I'm a vegan, which you always ignore.
Today's my birthday, we're eating vegan.

20:34.875 --> 20:38.000
I ignore it because vegans
are the new Taliban.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.250
-Come on!
-Terrorists!

20:39.333 --> 20:42.500
-What?
-You won't stop until we die of boredom!

20:42.583 --> 20:43.791
Boredom, why?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.000
Everything that's healthy is boring.

20:46.083 --> 20:50.291
Nobody invites their friends over
to eat deliciously cooked artichokes.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.333
Because eating artichokes...

20:52.416 --> 20:54.541
isn't fun.

20:55.125 --> 20:57.916
What's fun is eating lamb with friends

20:58.000 --> 20:59.375
or grilled piglet.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.833
Or gathering 50 friends at a country house
and eat a cow.

21:02.916 --> 21:04.958
That's fun.

21:05.041 --> 21:09.625
I'm sorry for the cow,
but that brings people together.

21:09.708 --> 21:12.916
Meat unites, cows unite
and artichokes...

21:13.000 --> 21:13.916
divide.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.583
Then, I don't know why they say,
"Eat healthy, eat a vegan pussy."

21:19.500 --> 21:21.500
For you, I can become a vegan, love.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.333
Not even with a ten-foot pole, honey.

21:26.666 --> 21:27.875
Professor.

21:29.916 --> 21:32.166
What probability do we have
of leaving the bank alive?

21:38.875 --> 21:40.958
Right now, I would say...

21:43.083 --> 21:44.958
less than 50 percent.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.166
Then, I want to say something.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.958
Well, I won't say it myself,
but it's practically the same.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.333
<i>Missing your lips</i>

22:13.416 --> 22:15.333
<i>I cried for the first time</i>

22:15.416 --> 22:17.666
<i>And I cursed meeting you</i>

22:17.750 --> 22:21.916
<i>Because I can't stop loving you</i>

22:25.458 --> 22:28.000
<i>I wanted to make you my wife</i>

22:28.083 --> 22:30.208
<i>With no love, I searched for luck</i>

22:30.291 --> 22:32.583
<i>I started to use guns</i>

22:32.666 --> 22:35.375
<i>And fate brought me death</i>

22:37.791 --> 22:41.208
<i>María, my life, my love</i>

22:41.666 --> 22:43.416
<i>I won't ever stop</i>

22:43.500 --> 22:45.666
<i>Loving you</i>

22:45.750 --> 22:49.000
<i>With bullets, I lost you</i>

22:49.708 --> 22:53.083
<i>You won't ever see me again</i>

22:54.375 --> 22:57.833
<i>María, my life, my love</i>

22:57.916 --> 22:59.916
<i>I won't ever stop</i>

23:00.000 --> 23:02.916
<i>Loving you</i>

23:12.250 --> 23:13.958
What happened here, Manolo?

23:15.250 --> 23:17.708
As you can see,
the van is stuck in the mud.

23:20.541 --> 23:21.958
Where did you get this van?

23:22.041 --> 23:24.000
I borrowed it from
my cousin Antonio, from Madrid.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.375
It's...

23:25.583 --> 23:26.750
the Professor's.

23:29.916 --> 23:31.083
What are you saying, Perico?

23:31.166 --> 23:33.375
My cousin Antonio is a teacher in Madrid.

23:34.625 --> 23:35.833
Is he?

23:37.958 --> 23:41.125
Juani and I are going
to Portugal in that van.

23:41.208 --> 23:42.291
Seven days.

23:42.375 --> 23:43.375
Please, shut up!

23:43.458 --> 23:45.750
And there, we will eat cod.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.875
This thing is huge.

23:50.875 --> 23:53.041
This is like a house inside, isn't it?

23:53.125 --> 23:54.166
Yes, like a small flat.

23:56.125 --> 23:57.250
-Can I go in?
-No!

23:59.375 --> 24:03.333
Look at your boots!
They're dirtier than a cow's ass!

24:05.791 --> 24:08.916
I mean your soles.
You will stain the carpet, man.

24:11.916 --> 24:13.208
Don't worry, man.

24:14.000 --> 24:14.833
Here, done.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.250
A kitchen and all.

24:37.416 --> 24:39.083
A fridge.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.000
What a place!

24:45.083 --> 24:46.291
It's very comfortable.

24:54.625 --> 24:56.708
Teachers make a good living, don't they.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.458
I'm going to buy one like this
once I retire.

25:02.541 --> 25:03.625
-Yes?
-Yes.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.208
I'll get a car to get this out of there.

25:06.291 --> 25:07.708
Thanks, Paco.

25:07.791 --> 25:08.625
At your service.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.041
Push!

25:46.041 --> 25:48.500
Wow! Give me a hug, Professor!

26:01.750 --> 26:02.583
<i>Tell me, Marseilles.</i>

26:02.666 --> 26:03.875
It's a tank truck.

26:03.958 --> 26:06.916
They're putting tubes through
the ventilation pipes.

26:07.000 --> 26:07.916
<i>Anything else?</i>

26:08.583 --> 26:09.500
That's all.

26:09.583 --> 26:10.625
Thank you.

26:12.541 --> 26:15.416
Narcotic gas. It's probably halothane.

26:15.500 --> 26:19.208
I know Sierra. She's going to do what
Putin did in the Dubrovka Theater.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.958
How far away are we from
the exchange point?

26:22.666 --> 26:23.958
Twelve kilometers.

26:43.958 --> 26:46.333
Hello. Is someone here?

26:49.833 --> 26:50.791
Turn up the volume.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.000
<i>...to prevent a death.</i>

26:52.083 --> 26:55.208
<i>As an example, should we use</i>
<i>harsher interrogations techniques</i>

26:55.291 --> 26:57.291
<i>on terrorists? What do you think?</i>

26:57.375 --> 26:59.041
<i>Are their rights being violated?</i>

26:59.125 --> 27:02.208
<i>The life of an innocent person</i>
<i>is worth more than a terrorist's.</i>

27:02.291 --> 27:05.875
<i>Are you confirming then,</i>
<i>that the police practice torture?</i>

27:05.958 --> 27:08.000
<i>-No, no. I'm only saying...</i>
-Son of a bitch.

27:12.750 --> 27:13.916
Can I go home already?

27:15.708 --> 27:17.208
No, you can't go home.

27:17.708 --> 27:20.666
Your statements are risking
everyone's safety.

27:20.750 --> 27:24.041
You will stay here until you learn
to keep your mouth shut.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.291
Where were you
during the previous robbery?

27:28.666 --> 27:29.791
Excuse me.

27:29.875 --> 27:31.416
Because I was there.

27:31.916 --> 27:35.958
Facing the terrorists,
saving the lives of 19 hostages.

27:37.416 --> 27:39.291
You brought me here as an expert.

27:40.791 --> 27:41.916
I may be very wrong,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.375
but I think you realized
you don't know shit and this is...

27:45.458 --> 27:46.666
over your head.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.166
Do you know what your problem is?

27:53.208 --> 27:54.791
Your life is shit.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.583
You talk to your followers,
they applaud you,

27:58.666 --> 28:00.875
and all this attention
makes you cum, right?

28:01.958 --> 28:04.291
But when you get home, there's no one.

28:05.125 --> 28:07.416
Your wife left you.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.916
You live in an apartment
full of cardboard boxes.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.333
You eat canned tuna,
and your sons don't want to see you.

28:12.416 --> 28:14.708
And you're obsessed with the kidnapping

28:14.791 --> 28:18.875
because it was the only noteworthy moment
of your life, and you miss it.

28:18.958 --> 28:22.625
That's why when you see a camera,
you grab onto it like a baby to a tit.

28:24.375 --> 28:26.458
You couldn't be more pitiful.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.375
Canned tuna, you say?

28:35.083 --> 28:36.041
Actually,

28:37.458 --> 28:39.875
my life is settled.

28:39.958 --> 28:42.750
I go from theater to theater,
filling every seat.

28:42.833 --> 28:45.833
I help them to improve their lives.
My book is an international bestseller.

28:45.916 --> 28:47.333
And everyone...

28:47.416 --> 28:49.166
absolutely everyone

28:49.250 --> 28:51.625
in this country considers me a hero.

28:52.583 --> 28:53.875
Canned tuna?

28:55.375 --> 28:57.083
Bold ignorance!

28:59.500 --> 29:01.250
Now, if you excuse me.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.416
No, friend.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.375
You aren't going anywhere.

29:40.958 --> 29:42.916
EMERGENCY

29:50.125 --> 29:50.958
Connected.

29:52.000 --> 29:52.833
Palermo.

29:54.166 --> 29:55.458
Palermo, do you copy?

30:04.500 --> 30:06.000
<i>The toilet's ventilation pipes</i>

30:06.083 --> 30:09.250
may be the only access
they won't control with bombs.

30:10.250 --> 30:13.041
<i>They were installed</i>
<i>and widened 17 months ago.</i>

30:14.291 --> 30:16.083
Even so, it's a narrow passage.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.708
<i>It's 45 by 80 centimeters.</i>

30:20.666 --> 30:22.750
<i>We will check that</i>
<i>the gas is taking effect.</i>

30:24.833 --> 30:27.083
Halothane's concentration, 67 percent.

30:28.291 --> 30:30.750
Gentlemen, we're going in.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.416
This is a high-risk mission.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.791
If they control it,

30:41.875 --> 30:44.083
that pipe is a damn slaughterhouse.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.500
<i>Halothane is a narcotic gas</i>

30:46.583 --> 30:48.125
<i>that makes you fall asleep in ten seconds</i>

30:48.208 --> 30:50.458
<i>when its concentration</i>
<i>in the air is over 50 percent.</i>

30:50.541 --> 30:52.125
Colonel, we reached the screen.

30:52.833 --> 30:54.250
It looks like there's someone there.

30:55.000 --> 30:55.916
He's not moving.

31:04.041 --> 31:06.750
<i>The police broke into the bank</i>
<i>the same way someone enters a nursery.</i>

31:08.000 --> 31:09.666
<i>Five elite agents</i>

31:09.750 --> 31:12.875
<i>and 30 clips full of bullets</i>
<i>to achieve a simple objective.</i>

31:13.500 --> 31:15.166
<i>To slaughter us like lambs.</i>

31:16.583 --> 31:17.666
<i>The truth</i>

31:18.000 --> 31:19.750
<i>is that we earned it.</i>

31:21.833 --> 31:23.875
We will do what Putin would do.

31:23.958 --> 31:25.625
Shoot first...

31:25.708 --> 31:27.875
and ask questions later.

31:27.958 --> 31:29.666
We'll try to avoid that.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.208
Understood?

31:31.291 --> 31:34.208
But in case of doubt, we assume
there can be civilian victims.

31:34.833 --> 31:35.708
Understood?

31:35.791 --> 31:37.166
Yes, sir.

31:37.250 --> 31:38.208
Understood?

31:38.291 --> 31:39.833
Yes, sir!

31:40.541 --> 31:41.625
Clear.

31:42.583 --> 31:43.500
Clear.

31:44.750 --> 31:45.791
Clear.

31:47.291 --> 31:48.125
Hostage.

32:03.333 --> 32:04.375
Hostage.

32:04.666 --> 32:05.625
Hostage.

32:22.000 --> 32:22.875
Get down!

32:28.208 --> 32:29.125
What the hell?!

32:31.208 --> 32:33.083
On the floor! Take cover! Take cover!

32:35.666 --> 32:37.375
Exit through the left, now!

32:39.291 --> 32:40.458
Let's go!

32:48.333 --> 32:50.083
Barricade!

32:52.458 --> 32:55.041
<i>Surviving such an operation is impossible,</i>

32:55.666 --> 32:57.583
<i>but by that time in our lives,</i>

32:57.666 --> 33:01.625
<i>we were experts in making sure</i>
<i>nothing was impossible.</i>

33:06.500 --> 33:07.333
Palermo.

33:07.416 --> 33:09.208
10 MINUTES BEFORE

33:09.291 --> 33:10.458
<i>Palermo, do you copy?</i>

33:10.791 --> 33:12.666
<i>They're using narcotic gas.</i>

33:13.208 --> 33:14.916
Professor. It's Tokyo.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.875
Professor, all the entries are blocked.

33:24.958 --> 33:26.708
Let's be sure about their entry route.

33:28.291 --> 33:31.166
They'll wait for the building to be filled
with gas. We have ten minutes.

33:34.791 --> 33:35.708
Change of plans.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.666
Retreat!

33:44.458 --> 33:46.833
<i>To confront them, we only needed oxygen.</i>

33:48.708 --> 33:50.000
<i>And to neutralize them,</i>

33:50.583 --> 33:53.583
<i>we only needed to block their path</i>
<i>so they didn't have a way out.</i>

33:56.625 --> 33:57.916
Smoke!

34:09.791 --> 34:11.666
How are you, Suárez?

34:14.208 --> 34:16.333
Did you see the bars?
They're pretty, right?

34:17.166 --> 34:19.041
It's plastic explosive RDX!

34:19.125 --> 34:20.916
Exactly.

34:21.250 --> 34:25.041
They're more than 40 kilograms
distributed in seven charges.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.708
I imagine I don't need to explain
what would happen

34:28.791 --> 34:32.375
if any of you dares to touch
a light beam, do I?

34:33.625 --> 34:35.583
Because this is how this works,

34:36.250 --> 34:40.791
the detonator is connected
to a photoelectric cell,

34:40.875 --> 34:43.000
and if a charge explodes,

34:43.083 --> 34:44.708
the rest of them do as well...

34:44.791 --> 34:46.291
in solidarity.

34:47.875 --> 34:49.208
Is your bomb expert here?

34:51.791 --> 34:52.625
Fuck!

34:52.708 --> 34:54.583
Then, I am going to recommend that you

34:54.666 --> 34:56.500
calm down

34:56.583 --> 34:59.416
because you're using up your oxygen,

34:59.500 --> 35:02.208
and you will start breathing halothane.

35:02.291 --> 35:03.458
Therefore,

35:03.541 --> 35:05.458
lie back,

35:05.541 --> 35:07.625
curl up

35:07.708 --> 35:10.625
and kiss each other good night, boys.

35:13.666 --> 35:15.666
Thirty-five minutes incommunicado.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.458
We're preparing a rescue mission.

35:18.541 --> 35:21.708
General, we can't do that. They'll riddle
them with bullets through the same hole.

35:21.791 --> 35:23.416
We don't know what happened there.

35:23.500 --> 35:27.166
We know we heard the Browning machine gun
and that there was return fire.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.291
Then, nothing.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.041
It's him.

35:48.208 --> 35:49.041
Martínez.

35:54.208 --> 35:55.041
<i>Professor?</i>

35:59.291 --> 36:03.166
I guess you're wondering what happened
to Inspector Suárez and his four men.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.875
What do you have to say about it?

36:06.416 --> 36:08.875
That his behavior was exemplary.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.791
I would describe the operation as...

36:11.916 --> 36:12.916
commendable.

36:14.583 --> 36:16.750
But how would I put it?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.250
There were complications.

36:20.291 --> 36:24.416
Don't worry, their health is
in perfect condition, of course.

36:24.500 --> 36:28.291
Actually,  we're sending you
a video right now so you can be sure.

36:28.375 --> 36:29.708
Martínez!

36:31.583 --> 36:33.458
I think it's better if you see it.

36:39.166 --> 36:42.291
<i>I'm Inspector Suárez,</i>
<i>head of the Special Operations Team.</i>

36:43.041 --> 36:44.875
<i>We're captives.</i>

36:45.583 --> 36:48.083
<i>But I have to say</i>
<i>we're being treated well.</i>

36:50.958 --> 36:52.666
<i>I beg the authorities</i>

36:53.500 --> 36:55.583
<i>to order a permanent ceasefire.</i>

36:56.208 --> 36:58.250
<i>Very good! Very good!</i>

36:59.750 --> 37:00.916
<i>What's next?</i>

37:02.791 --> 37:03.708
<i>Come on!</i>

37:05.708 --> 37:07.500
<i>What's next? Come on!</i>

37:10.166 --> 37:11.500
<i>One morning...</i>

37:13.291 --> 37:14.833
<i>I woke up.</i>

37:15.958 --> 37:19.000
<i>Beautiful, goodbye</i>
<i>Beautiful, goodbye</i>

37:19.083 --> 37:21.625
<i>Beautiful, goodbye</i>
<i>Goodbye, goodbye</i>

37:21.708 --> 37:24.166
<i>One morning</i>

37:24.250 --> 37:26.208
<i>I woke up</i>

37:26.791 --> 37:29.208
<i>And I found an invader</i>

37:29.291 --> 37:30.583
Very entertaining.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.791
But he's sending it to us,

37:34.416 --> 37:35.541
not to the press.

37:35.625 --> 37:38.708
I deduce that the Professor wants

37:38.791 --> 37:40.541
<i>to negotiate.</i>

37:41.083 --> 37:43.125
I see you're a real artist.

37:43.708 --> 37:45.708
I'll offer you something better.

37:46.416 --> 37:48.083
I'll offer you an exit.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.500
The Committee against Torture

37:51.583 --> 37:54.708
of the United Nations has opened
an investigation into the Cortés case.

37:54.791 --> 37:55.916
It's a matter of hours

37:56.000 --> 37:58.916
before they send forensic doctors
to interrogate him

37:59.000 --> 38:01.375
and neither you nor the presidency
want that.

38:01.875 --> 38:03.375
Son of a bitch.

38:03.833 --> 38:05.791
Your only solution is to hand over Rio.

38:06.875 --> 38:08.916
I am not going to hand a prisoner over.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.625
The police doesn't hand over thieves.

38:11.708 --> 38:14.166
Yes, of course,
but there's a second reason.

38:17.375 --> 38:21.625
Your operation made it quite obvious
that you've already decided to kill us.

38:23.791 --> 38:25.666
But under custody,

38:25.750 --> 38:28.458
you can't eliminate Cortés. However...

38:30.291 --> 38:32.250
inside the bank, in an escape,

38:32.333 --> 38:33.791
in a chase...

38:34.500 --> 38:35.500
you can.

38:38.166 --> 38:41.458
I'm offering the state a better situation
than the current one.

38:43.208 --> 38:46.208
I'm saving you from
the huge international ridicule

38:46.291 --> 38:49.333
of spreading the video of
your elite commando singing "Bella Ciao."

38:51.125 --> 38:52.291
Hand him over.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.583
We accept the exchange.

39:00.791 --> 39:01.958
Hand him over.

39:13.208 --> 39:16.750
I want all the hostages and GEOs.
I need to sell this as a victory.

39:18.458 --> 39:21.083
I will give you 40 hostages
and your elite commando.

39:21.833 --> 39:23.583
You can sell that as a victory.

39:24.458 --> 39:25.291
It's eight p.m.

39:25.375 --> 39:26.208
<i>No.</i>

39:27.041 --> 39:30.625
I want light.
We'll make the exchange at eight a.m.

39:31.333 --> 39:33.666
I am not going to get
40 civilians out of there

39:33.750 --> 39:35.458
<i>without knowing what's going on.</i>

39:38.583 --> 39:39.708
Accepted.

39:48.166 --> 39:49.000
Take care of it.

39:49.083 --> 39:49.916
Of course.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.250
Martínez!

39:54.666 --> 39:56.125
<i>Tokyo, they've accepted.</i>

40:18.166 --> 40:19.083
Hello.

40:23.666 --> 40:25.083
Did you sleep well?

40:29.041 --> 40:30.750
How long have I been asleep for?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.541
Fourteen hours.

40:34.833 --> 40:35.875
I'm very sleepy.

40:38.375 --> 40:40.166
You asked for something to sleep.

40:40.875 --> 40:42.875
And they gave you an elephantine dose.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.083
Don't you remember?

40:46.208 --> 40:47.041
Right.

40:48.000 --> 40:48.875
Come on.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.791
We've to get you all dolled up.
You're going to be on TV.

40:52.375 --> 40:53.458
Let's go.

40:54.041 --> 40:55.125
Come on.

41:16.916 --> 41:18.125
Where are you taking me?

41:19.041 --> 41:20.208
To school.

41:21.041 --> 41:22.666
Do you want me to make you some cereal?

41:23.833 --> 41:25.500
Are you really going to be a mother?

41:26.833 --> 41:29.291
Will you go to your son's school
to ready the kids a story?

41:29.958 --> 41:31.000
Of course.

41:31.083 --> 41:34.833
And we will bring them lollipops to bother
all those sexually frustrated mothers

41:34.916 --> 41:36.875
who say candy's bad for kids.

41:38.708 --> 41:39.625
Alicia.

41:42.791 --> 41:44.125
Your son won't love you.

41:49.458 --> 41:50.791
But you will adore me.

41:52.833 --> 41:53.666
Let's go.

41:55.250 --> 41:56.958
Are you going to tell me
where we are going?

41:57.041 --> 41:57.958
To school.

42:53.166 --> 42:55.208
HOSTAGE SWAP AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

43:16.000 --> 43:17.458
<i>And the impossible was there.</i>

43:19.333 --> 43:21.208
<i>We had to make a racket,</i>

43:22.666 --> 43:26.250
<i>but everything seemed insignificant to me</i>
<i>when I saw Rio getting out of the car.</i>

43:27.750 --> 43:29.125
<i>He was alive.</i>

43:30.666 --> 43:31.916
<i>Disoriented...</i>

43:32.250 --> 43:33.875
<i>and out of sorts.</i>

43:35.708 --> 43:37.666
<i>But he looked so handsome.</i>
