00:03.921 --> 00:06.005
Welcome to the Stichers program.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.689
We work for a secret government agency

00:07.691 --> 00:09.374
that hacks into the brains of
corpses and reads their memories.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.343
Maggie: His name was Ed Clark.
Why'd he kill himself?

00:11.345 --> 00:12.778
He didn't and he wasn't my father.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.113
All right stitching affects you.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.147
Makes you different for a little bit.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.280
It doesn't always last.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.317
You hooked up with Linus?

00:18.319 --> 00:19.919
Thought we had each other's backs.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.520
Cameron: <i>When I was 10 years
old, I had heart surgery.</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:24.223
Kirsten: <i>My father stitching
me into my mother killed her.</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:26.458
Cameron?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.961
I see Barbiero.
He's on a call with a woman.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.196
You're using me to send
a message to the girl?

00:31.198 --> 00:33.065
Kirsten: <i>He was told things
that I was meant to hear</i>

00:33.067 --> 00:34.400
and then he was killed.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.468
Black sedan. Can't make out the plates.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.703
But maybe you did, Cameron.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.338
Cameron: That memory is inside my head.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.372
You're gonna go in and find it.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.807
There's one problem. You're not dead.

00:41.809 --> 00:42.975
I can fix that.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.077
Guys...

00:45.079 --> 00:46.311
You got four minutes.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.480
Dead or alive, Cameron,
you're coming with me!

00:48.482 --> 00:49.882
(Whirring)

00:49.884 --> 00:51.216
I'm there! I'm outside the restaurant,

00:51.218 --> 00:53.218
but it's all blurry! It's useless!

00:53.220 --> 00:54.153
Is this what love is?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.387
I'm everywhere.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.889
- What's your name?
- Kirsten.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.541
I'm Cameron.

00:58.542 --> 01:00.192
- ...levels are increasing!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:00.194 --> 01:02.161
(Thump)

01:02.163 --> 01:03.195
Cameron!

01:12.039 --> 01:14.073

01:14.075 --> 01:15.240

01:15.242 --> 01:16.875

- (Beeping)

01:16.877 --> 01:18.710
- Cameron!

01:20.047 --> 01:21.280

01:22.850 --> 01:24.616
- Clear!
- (Thump)

01:29.056 --> 01:30.255
(Beeping)

01:35.096 --> 01:37.329
Chelsea, time please.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.634
Chelsea, time.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.872
Time of death, 17:31.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.140
No! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:48.142 --> 01:49.208
- Shock him again!
- Kirsten...

01:49.210 --> 01:50.242
Shock him again!

01:50.244 --> 01:51.477
He is not dead.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.945
I can feel it. He wants to come back.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.613
Please, please just shock him again.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.781
- Shock him.
- Do it.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.618
Clear!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.220
- (Flatline)
- No, no.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.654
(Whimpers)

02:02.656 --> 02:03.989
Cameron, no.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.825
No, Cameron! No!

02:06.827 --> 02:08.127
No!

02:08.128 --> 02:10.294
Please!

02:11.565 --> 02:14.566
(Sobs) Please!

02:16.103 --> 02:17.302
Cameron!

02:17.304 --> 02:19.071
(Sobs)

02:20.307 --> 02:21.740
No.

(Sobs)

02:25.613 --> 02:26.979
(Gasps)

02:28.182 --> 02:29.681
Cameron? Cameron?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.116
I can't believe this.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.684
Please...

02:34.622 --> 02:37.422
Tell me you got
the license plate number.

02:37.424 --> 02:40.359
No. No, I didn't.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.493
(Sobs)

02:43.297 --> 02:45.030
Well, that's too bad...

02:46.200 --> 02:48.867
'Cause I'm not doing this again.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.702
It's okay.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.906
- (Chuckles)

(Blipping)

03:35.549 --> 03:36.782
(Door opens)

03:40.321 --> 03:41.653
How's he doing?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.223
He's fine.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.724
Good.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.660
'Cause as soon as he wakes up,
I'm gonna kill him.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.996
The real question's how are you doing?

03:52.099 --> 03:53.165
You know me.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.667
I thought I did. That's why I'm asking.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.639
I think I was just a little overwhelmed.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.408
Well, that's understandable...

04:03.410 --> 04:05.510
Except we're talking about you here.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.613
Cameron: Keep it down.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.616
Trying to rest in peace.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.585
Hey.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.587
How are you doing, tough guy?

04:15.589 --> 04:18.190
Oh, 100%.

04:18.192 --> 04:19.625
(Chuckles)

04:22.863 --> 04:24.396
How's Fisher?

04:24.398 --> 04:26.431
He's out of danger.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.333
He's gonna be fine.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.536
Cameron?

04:31.538 --> 04:35.040
Do you remember anything
from the stitch?

04:36.377 --> 04:39.311
I had a dream that you were, um...

04:39.313 --> 04:42.714
An angel and I was a... hero.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.283
(Chuckles)

04:47.087 --> 04:49.121
What'd you see when you were in my head?

04:52.626 --> 04:54.526
Linus, may I see you in the hallway?

04:55.462 --> 04:56.662
I want to hear.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.297
Ouch! O... okay, okay.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.000
(Door closes)

05:03.437 --> 05:04.569
What'd you see?

05:07.174 --> 05:08.774
Is this what love is?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.175
Intense connection

05:10.177 --> 05:12.277
and then heartbreaking loss?

05:12.279 --> 05:14.179
Thank you...

05:14.181 --> 05:16.348
For not being a nobody.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.420
I saw...

05:25.659 --> 05:27.159
It can wait.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.201
Camille: That was probably the most

05:36.203 --> 05:37.636
awful experience of my life.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.037
I know.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.908
I mean, did you see her
when Cameron revived?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.044
I've never seen her like that. Have you?

05:46.046 --> 05:47.546
Never!

05:47.548 --> 05:49.715
She's always only ever been, you know...

05:49.717 --> 05:51.483
How do I even say it
without sounding mean?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.819
Ugh... emotionally reserved?

05:53.821 --> 05:55.854
Um, emotionally inaccessible.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.922
Bitchy.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.058
But now she's completely different.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.527
She cried.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.795
I mean, you saw it.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.397
Like, big, soppy tears.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.165
That wasn't residual emotion.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.467
That was real emotion!

06:09.803 --> 06:11.503
God, I hope it lasts.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.372
(Sighs)

06:13.374 --> 06:15.440
Well, she's not the only one
who's changed.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.443
Why? What do you mean by that?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.812
I've been a jerk.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.347
- Oh...
- No, no, no, no.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.382
Listen, I... I have.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.883
Yeah, no, I was gonna agree with you.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.222
I don't know what's gotten
into me the past couple of days.

06:31.325 --> 06:32.445
Cameron was right about you.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.861
You did a great job during the stitch.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.629
Much better than I would've.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.899
(Exhales)

06:40.901 --> 06:42.467
Thank you, Linus.

06:43.570 --> 06:48.607
Everyday I deal with life and death

06:48.609 --> 06:51.743
and shattered lives
and heartbroken people,

06:51.745 --> 06:53.445
and then I go back to the same bedroom

06:53.447 --> 06:55.547
in my parents' house that I grew up in.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.048
I mean, how does that even make sense?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.418
Yeah. (Chuckles)

07:00.788 --> 07:02.187
It's time I grew up.

07:02.189 --> 07:05.223
Well, you know,
you could be feeling this way

07:05.225 --> 07:07.559
because of what happened to Cameron.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.693
Sleep on it. Who knows?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.195
You could feel differently tomorrow.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.032
I hope not.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.272
Maggie: How could you let
Cameron do that to himself?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.073
I only agreed with him.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.476
It wasn't like I stuck
the damn needle in his arm.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.481
Look, Maggie...

07:32.619 --> 07:34.653
Yesterday was a hard day on all of us.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.224
Why don't you go home? Take the day off.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.959
Tomorrow, we'll dig back in,

07:40.961 --> 07:43.628
figure out where this threat
to our program is coming from.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.233
From where I stand, you are
the biggest threat to the team.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.787
Easy now.

07:51.788 --> 07:54.172
Remember, I am the director
of the program that employs you.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.585
A few months ago, I asked you

08:06.587 --> 08:08.453
what I should tell Kirsten
when she asks me

08:08.455 --> 08:11.156
what the real purpose
of the Stichers program is.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.457
Do you remember what you told me?

08:12.459 --> 08:15.260
I said you should tell her
whatever you want

08:15.262 --> 08:16.795
as long as it's not the truth.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.430
Why can't she know?

08:18.432 --> 08:19.698
Why can't they all know?

08:21.335 --> 08:24.436
That we are developing
a technology to accelerate

08:24.438 --> 08:26.538
the evolution of the human brain?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.974
What are you keeping from me, les?

08:28.976 --> 08:31.610
I know it's something. What is it?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.546
You took Fisher off
the Ed Clark investigation.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.615
Why? Was he getting close to something?

08:36.616 --> 08:39.317
Listen, I think we're done here.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.119
You killed Ed Clark, didn't you?

08:41.121 --> 08:43.722
Just because you hang out
with kids all day

08:43.724 --> 08:45.690
doesn't mean we're playing a game.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.460
I'm asking you again!
Did you kill Ed Clark?

08:48.462 --> 08:51.329
Saving the world is a messy business.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.399
People get hurt. Some get killed.

08:54.401 --> 08:58.703
How many people are you willing
to kill to save six billion?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.672
I don't know.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.141
But I assure you, if pushed,

09:03.143 --> 09:05.677
I would kill one to save 19.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.946
Well, that's the number
of people in your lab.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.149
Who's the one you'd kill to save them?

09:14.388 --> 09:15.620
(Door rattling)

09:17.925 --> 09:19.658
- Cameron?
- Morning, sunshine!

09:19.660 --> 09:22.160
Um, what...

09:22.162 --> 09:23.695
Uh, how are you feeling?

09:23.697 --> 09:24.863
I feel great!

09:24.865 --> 09:26.765
Yeah, doctor said I'm good to go.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.999
Apparently death agrees with me.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.034
You okay?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.335
Yeah.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.436
No, she's not.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.537
Go ahead. Tell him.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.605
Tell him what?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.740
She's been feeling
a little emotionally raw

09:35.742 --> 09:37.375
since the last stitch.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.777
Cameron: Emotions?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.545
As in those things
you don't normally feel?

09:40.547 --> 09:41.580
Mm-hmm.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.616
If it's okay, I would like
to talk to Cameron.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.519
And Fisher wants to talk to you.

09:47.521 --> 09:48.753
He's awake.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.627
Cameron: Well, some people

09:55.628 --> 09:57.708
will do anything to avoid
having to be with a friend.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.131
I didn't know we were friends.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.466
Oh, shut up.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.767
We all know you're crazy about me.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.703
- (Chuckling)
- Hey, but seriously, man,

10:04.705 --> 10:06.865
thanks for pushing me out of
the way at the restaurant.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.640
Kirsten.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.714
At the restaurant,
what I wanted to tell you,

10:15.716 --> 10:18.984
les Turner ordered me to stop
looking into Ed Clark's murder.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.952
Why did he do that?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.755
I think because I was getting
too close to the truth.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.857
I think Turner killed Ed.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.562
Son of a bitch.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.497
Stay with Fisher.

10:32.499 --> 10:33.698
What? Kirsten!

10:43.343 --> 10:44.409
Turner!

10:58.659 --> 10:59.958
- (Alarm blaring)
- Kirsten: Okay.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.426
Yeah, I know the way into my own lab.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.862
Stand down, Admiral.
I'll take it from here.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.765
You okay, stretch?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.634
Still freaked out
about Turner getting killed.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.336
I mean, everyone is. Look at this place.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.371
It's like union station
during rush hour.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.539
I like to pack heat...

11:14.541 --> 11:16.141
Oh, God, there's more of them?

11:16.143 --> 11:17.876
First Fisher and now Turner.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.845
Looks like the NSA isn't taking
any chances with the rest of us.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.881
Just because you're the guy
in the black jumpsuit

11:22.883 --> 11:25.884
doesn't mean I have to explain
mind map anomalies to you.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.486
That's exactly why
you should explain them to me.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.055
Ahem, everything okay?

11:31.158 --> 11:33.525
The head of the Stichers
program just got murdered.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.660
There's something very wonky
about his mind map

11:35.662 --> 11:36.795
that I cannot figure out

11:36.797 --> 11:38.363
and I've got a high school dropout here

11:38.365 --> 11:39.864
who wants me to explain it to him.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.733
A heavily armed high school dropout.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.403
You must be Clark...

11:45.405 --> 11:47.005
The one who strips
and gets in the water.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.075
I see that you have
met Captain Stamperson.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.710
NSA has assigned a captain

11:51.712 --> 11:53.812
and his men as our new security detail.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.346
He's asking a lot of questions.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.682
Which I have the authority,
security clearance,

11:57.684 --> 11:58.817
and imperative to know.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.085
And which you will, but this facility is

12:00.087 --> 12:02.854
under my authority until
a new director is appointed

12:02.856 --> 12:04.622
and I am told otherwise.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.661
How are you taking it, Maggie?

12:09.663 --> 12:13.131
Well, les and I had
our differences, but this...

12:14.367 --> 12:15.934
There was no sign of forced entry

12:15.936 --> 12:17.335
at Turner's apartment, so it's likely

12:17.337 --> 12:18.737
he knew his killer.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.338
You okay to do this?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.607
Sure. Why are you asking?

12:22.608 --> 12:24.875
We're worried you may be more emotionally
vulnerable in the stitch right now.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.745
Because of what happened to Turner?

12:26.747 --> 12:28.213
Linus: That...

12:28.214 --> 12:29.680
And because you had
a complete meltdown yesterday.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.750
That's why we want you to try something.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.865
I had just gotten used
to the Catwoman suit.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.933
I know, but there was
some more push back.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.435
This is the rev 2.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.037
We've been prototyping it
since Marta's accident.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.473
It's made from the same
zinc-blackened nickel over copper,

12:55.475 --> 12:57.609
but reinforced with padding
and kevlar panels.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.777
Kevlar?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.245
Let's be honest, you used to come out

13:00.247 --> 13:01.646
of the stitch and sort of feel emotions,

13:01.648 --> 13:02.947
and ever since yesterday's stitch,

13:02.949 --> 13:04.415
you've been starting
to really feel them.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.483
Okay.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.951
Well, how is this suit gonna protect me?

13:06.953 --> 13:09.387
It's simple psychology. How do you feel?

13:12.159 --> 13:13.958
I mean, slightly badass.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.959
Then it's working.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.761
The knowledge that you're wearing

13:16.763 --> 13:18.463
a slightly badass suit
will make you feel stronger,

13:18.465 --> 13:19.731
so then you'll be stronger.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.966
Okay, Captain, why don't
you come with me?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.406
Hey, um...

13:28.408 --> 13:30.108
What'd you want to tell me
at the hospital?

13:30.110 --> 13:32.844
(Alarm chimes)

13:34.815 --> 13:36.247
It can wait.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.863
I was briefed, but...

13:51.865 --> 13:52.964
I didn't believe it.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.166
So...

13:55.168 --> 13:57.135
She can see his memories?

13:57.137 --> 13:59.604
Maggie: It's called stitching.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.039
Does she have to eat his brain?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.774
What? No!

14:02.776 --> 14:05.109
Ugh. She's not a zombie.
This is science.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.177
Thank God.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.482
All right, everyone listen up.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.952
Whatever we felt about Turner,
he got us where we are today.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.021
So, let's bring our "a" game.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.857
Lights to 20%.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.692
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.

14:20.694 --> 14:21.960
- Life-sci?
- Go.

14:21.962 --> 14:22.894
- Sub-bio?
- Go.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.295
- Engineering?
- Go.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.964
- Communications?
- Go.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.031
- Medical?
- Go.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.333
Comtek. Kirsten, one, two, one, two.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.367
I hear you.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.936
Mission clock set
to five minutes, please.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.439
(Sighs) Here we go.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.842
"Open the pod bay doors please, hal."

14:37.844 --> 14:39.911
That's from <i> 2001.</i>

14:39.913 --> 14:42.380
He watched a lot of movies
when he was a kid.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.349
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.151
In three, two, one...

14:47.153 --> 14:48.186
Mark.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.554
(Whirring)

14:52.726 --> 14:54.659
Um, I'm in Turner's apartment.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.693
(Indistinct chatter)

14:55.695 --> 14:57.262
There's something seriously wrong here.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.329
Describe it.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.565
Turner's memory is a mess.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.066
- It's like it...
- (Crashing)

15:02.068 --> 15:07.338
...exploded from the center
of his consciousness.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.673
It's making me really dizzy.

15:08.675 --> 15:09.707
Linus?

15:09.709 --> 15:11.542
His mind map is completely fragmented.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.544
- Can you defrag it?
- I don't know.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.246
Kirsten, how are you holding up?
You wanna bounce?

15:15.248 --> 15:16.748
No, not yet.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.917
There's still bits and pieces
that are visible. (Gasps)

15:18.919 --> 15:20.218
Oh, wait. I smell something.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.953
Incense.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.788
She's experiencing sense memory.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.123
Huh, that's new.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.125
No, I really don't feel well.
I'm bouncing.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.561
(Whirring)

15:30.563 --> 15:31.863
Trash can. Quick.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.735
(Vomits, coughs)

15:37.737 --> 15:39.671
- She do that every time?
- No.

15:40.774 --> 15:41.906
That's also new.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.408
Linus: When a body comes in,

15:43.410 --> 15:45.443
the first thing we do is
map his or her memories.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.945
Specific memories have a pattern.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.414
Uh, a puppy, your first kiss.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.950
Or in your case, the first time
you broke someone's arm.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.251
Keep pushing me, Goodkin.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.919
- "Dr." Goodkin.
- Cameron.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.054
Anyway...

15:56.056 --> 15:58.456
For the last 15 years,
the Stichers program

15:58.458 --> 16:01.426
has cataloged over 18 million
unique human experiences.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.127
The computer compares
the digital signature

16:03.129 --> 16:04.395
of these experiences

16:04.397 --> 16:07.065
against the subject's mind map
as well as determining

16:07.067 --> 16:08.132
the age of the memory.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.901
That's how we know
where to move Kirsten.

16:09.903 --> 16:11.402
What do you know?

16:11.404 --> 16:13.564
The high school dropout
understood everything you said.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.340
(Sighs)

16:15.342 --> 16:17.675
Here's what a normal
mind map looks like...

16:18.912 --> 16:20.478
And this is what Turner's looks like.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.147
Cameron: Turner's brain
unfragmented his memories

16:23.149 --> 16:24.449
along all three axes.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.918
That's why I got nauseous.
I was completely disoriented.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.686
Could Turner have trained

16:28.688 --> 16:30.588
his mind to make himself unstitchable?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.090
With Turner, it's possible.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.324
Any chance you can resort his memories?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.426
I'm already working on it.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.996
I wanna go to Turner's condo. I saw something
in the stitch that I want to check out.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.031
Okay. Camille's with Fisher,
so you and Cameron go.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.299
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.267
Hold it. Lee, kirkwood, go with them.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.203
Um, we don't need babysitting.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.105
My job is to keep you safe

16:47.107 --> 16:48.806
whether I feel like it or not.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.975
Oh. That hurts my feelings.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.443
Okay, boys, let's go.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.811
Try to keep up.

16:53.813 --> 16:54.879
On it.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.420
(Whistles)

17:03.490 --> 17:05.189
Wow.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.391
So what are we looking for?

17:07.694 --> 17:08.893
Uh...

17:08.895 --> 17:11.329
- (Door closes)
- (Radio chatter)

17:11.330 --> 17:12.563
That.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.200
Ah. Yup.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.202
It's a ginsburg.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.804
Still don't see the attraction.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.040
(Beeping)

17:23.042 --> 17:24.108
(Buzzes)

17:25.178 --> 17:27.145
Okay. What's the code?

17:28.748 --> 17:31.182
In the stitch, I saw the number one...

17:31.184 --> 17:32.450
Six, three.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.819
(Beeping)

17:34.821 --> 17:36.487
(Buzzes)

17:36.489 --> 17:37.722
Okay, what else?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.093
A grasshopper. I saw a grasshopper.

17:42.095 --> 17:45.129
(Beeping)

17:48.902 --> 17:50.001
(Buzzes)

17:50.003 --> 17:51.563
Officer: I'm gonna go look around here.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.338
What's Turner's ancestry?

17:54.340 --> 17:56.407
I think I heard Maggie
say something once,

17:56.409 --> 17:59.177
like, he was French Moroccan?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.845
<i>Sauterelle.</i>

18:00.847 --> 18:03.281
- (Beeping)
- It's French for "grasshopper."

18:03.283 --> 18:04.682
(French accent) But of course.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.918
(Chiming)

18:09.189 --> 18:10.521
Turner has a panic room.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.790
Cameron: Whoa.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.325
<i>Sacrebleu.</i>

18:28.208 --> 18:29.208
The hard drive's missing.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.311
Look.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.514
It's a federal inventory
control sticker.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.118
(Shutter clicks)

18:41.254 --> 18:43.287
But it's hospital policy.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.622
I don't care.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.891
I don't want a sponge bath.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.292
Don't be a baby, Fisher.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.228
Take your bath like a good boy.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.230
(Phone chimes)

18:57.937 --> 18:59.237
Where are you going?

18:59.239 --> 19:01.506
Sorry, Fishcakes, I gotta get to work.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.141
- But...
- Keep her busy.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.409
Take the frickin' bath.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.646
Bye, honey.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.780
He's all yours.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.382
Fine.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.255
But my safe word is "not there."

19:40.346 --> 19:41.712
(Beep)

19:44.884 --> 19:46.184
(Beep)

19:50.290 --> 19:52.456
Mm, habanero potato chip?

19:52.458 --> 19:54.325
No thank you.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.227
- You don't do spicy?
- I don't do dead people's food.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.297
- Mm.
- Also, you know, Turner's body was just here.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.898
Right.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.233
Sorry you had to see that.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.335
As if that video of your dad
stitching you into your mom

20:04.337 --> 20:08.072
wasn't bad enough.

20:08.073 --> 20:11.808
You know, whatever crashed
in my head when he did that...

20:11.811 --> 20:13.945
It cut me off from my emotions, right?

20:15.848 --> 20:19.083
I think that stitching
into you rebooted me.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.386
I guess it's possible.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.422
I mean, stitching
into a live person broke you,

20:24.424 --> 20:26.257
so stitching into
another live person fixed you.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.159
Right, but you were dead.

20:28.161 --> 20:30.261
I was only mostly dead.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.398
I was really scared, you know.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.300
Seeing you like that.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.201
I have never been scared
like that before.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.605
Hey, but scared is sometimes good...

20:40.607 --> 20:42.707
Unless it becomes the new normal.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.543
In which case, that's no way to live.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.744
(Phone rings)

20:48.848 --> 20:50.281
Camille.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.282
- Talk to us.
- Okay.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.251
So thanks to an exploit I found

20:53.253 --> 20:55.086
in the GSA inventory control database,

20:55.088 --> 20:58.623
which, BT dubs, was the size
of Taylor Swift's ex-list,

20:58.625 --> 20:59.924
I learned that Turner's computer

20:59.926 --> 21:02.426
was listed as destroyed 15 years ago.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.061
- But it wasn't.
- Exactly.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.030
So, I went deep and I found
the company that supplied

21:06.032 --> 21:07.965
the inventory control stickers
to the government,

21:07.967 --> 21:09.133
found the shipping address

21:09.135 --> 21:10.301
where that particular sticker was sent,

21:10.303 --> 21:13.037
and I'm texting it to you now.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.772
(Phone chirps)

21:14.774 --> 21:16.474
Got it. Thanks.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.242
Hey, say hi to Fish, okay?

21:18.244 --> 21:21.479
Hold it. Captain Stamperson wants
us to bring you back to the lab.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.315
Well, this is going to be
an excellent lesson

21:24.317 --> 21:26.417
for Stamperson on not getting
everything he wants.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.052
He said by any means possible.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.488
Fine. Then you can give us a hand.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.722
With what?

21:31.724 --> 21:33.391
The computer.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.595
Obviously the computer.

21:37.597 --> 21:40.298
Yup. It's what we came here for.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.833
Let's bag it, tag it,
and get it back to the lab.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.303
I'll, uh, look for a garbage can,

21:45.305 --> 21:48.172
laundry basket, bread basket,
something to carry it in.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.642
(Beeping, chiming)

21:51.644 --> 21:53.577
Hey! No!

21:53.579 --> 21:56.347
Wow, check out the testicles
on Cameron 2.0.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.149
- Thank you.
- Lee: Hey! Open the door!

21:58.151 --> 22:00.017
- Uh-huh.
- Hey!

22:09.362 --> 22:11.195
Yeah, there's no
easy access here either.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.964
This whole building's locked tight.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.334
This place is deserted,
but not derelict.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.271
Someone's been taking care of it.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.745
- Wait here.
- Excuse me?

22:30.116 --> 22:31.449
Cameron, what are you doing?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.551
I'm seeing if there's a way
in through the roof.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.952
If there is...

22:34.954 --> 22:36.554
I'll come down and open the
doors from the inside.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.621
Cameron!

22:37.623 --> 22:39.690
Don't get so scared all the time!

22:49.736 --> 22:51.335
Who are you?

22:51.337 --> 22:53.838
Are you out of your mind?
What if you fell?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.673
But I didn't, so calm down.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.541
"Calm down"? "Calm down"?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.577
I'm beginning to miss the old Kirsten.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.845
What's that supposed to mean?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.580
I barely survived having one mother.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.215
I don't need another one.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.384
I think I'm beginning
to miss the old Cameron.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.620
Whoa.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.490
What is that?

23:23.236 --> 23:27.338
Something big was bolted down here.

23:27.340 --> 23:29.740
- (Low buzzing)
- (Shudders)

23:29.742 --> 23:31.609
- Do you feel that?
- What?

23:31.611 --> 23:32.643
Come in.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.213
(Low buzzing)

23:36.215 --> 23:37.615
Whoa.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.518
Yeah, now I do.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.520
It's only inside this circle.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.262
You feel that?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.098
Yeah.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.701
It's, um...

23:57.703 --> 23:59.770
it's static electricity.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.140
Where's it coming from?

24:03.142 --> 24:04.809
There must be something about this place

24:04.811 --> 24:07.144
that was in Turner's hard drive.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.712
What went on in here?

24:10.082 --> 24:11.582
Hey!

24:11.584 --> 24:12.450
Don't move!

24:12.452 --> 24:14.385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's okay, guys!

24:14.387 --> 24:15.453
We're NSA!

24:15.455 --> 24:16.454
Let me see your badges.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.488
Badges?

24:17.490 --> 24:19.156
Cameron, your heart
can't take being tased.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.891
We ain't got no badges.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.059
We don't need no badges.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.028
I ain't gotta show you
any stinkin' badges.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.831
- (Grunts)
- (Clicking)

24:26.833 --> 24:28.199
Kirsten!

24:29.735 --> 24:31.068
- (Grunts)
- (Clicking)

24:37.310 --> 24:39.009
(Sighs)

24:39.011 --> 24:40.444
Okay, so maybe a movie quote

24:40.446 --> 24:41.812
wasn't the best idea at the time.

24:41.814 --> 24:42.913
Hm...

24:44.083 --> 24:46.317
- How's your hand?
- Oh, it's fine.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.452
But you shouldn't have jumped in
front of that taser like that.

24:48.454 --> 24:49.587
You could have gotten hurt.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.690
Said the man who
recently stopped his own heart.

24:52.692 --> 24:53.791
(Chuckles)

24:53.793 --> 24:55.159
I guess we're even.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.506
What is going on with you?

25:08.508 --> 25:10.307
Climbing buildings,

25:10.309 --> 25:13.143
locking security guards in a panic room,

25:13.145 --> 25:14.378
slugging people?

25:14.380 --> 25:15.880
I can't help it.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.982
I can't. I just... I feel free.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.617
I died.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.851
I died and then I came back.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.720
I... I get a second chance
to live my life.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.522
I'm not gonna live in fear anymore.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.958
Hey, it's still me.

25:27.960 --> 25:32.029
Cameron... 2.0.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.430
Remember?

25:36.569 --> 25:37.735
What's your name?

25:39.071 --> 25:40.137
Kirsten.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.605
I'm Cameron.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.544
Your mom's gonna be okay, Kirsten.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.912
Trust me.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.318
We met when we were kids.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.254
What?

25:59.659 --> 26:01.625
We met in the hospital.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.328
I was there.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.764
It was right after
my mom's accident, and...

26:06.766 --> 26:09.567
You were there for your heart surgery.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.402
I have that memory?

26:13.606 --> 26:15.072
Wow.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.108
I mean, I don't remember much

26:18.110 --> 26:20.244
before my dad stitched me.

26:21.514 --> 26:22.580
Are you sure you don't remember?

26:22.582 --> 26:24.782
I mean, I was in
and out of that hospital

26:24.784 --> 26:26.750
for weeks at a time.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.285
And there... there was
so many kids my age.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.653
Did we... did we talk?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.090
Yeah. You told me
my mom was gonna be okay.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.561
Sorry I was wrong.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.797
No, it's okay.

26:39.799 --> 26:43.200
You were very sweet
to a scared little girl.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.935
(Footsteps)

26:44.937 --> 26:47.705
I am very tempted to have the two of you

26:47.707 --> 26:50.608
spend the night here making new
friends in your holding cells.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.776
Blatant disregard for protocol,

26:52.778 --> 26:55.813
breaking and entering,
assaulting a security guard,

26:55.815 --> 26:56.914
getting arrested?

26:56.916 --> 26:59.083
In our defense,
things wouldn't have escalated

26:59.085 --> 27:00.718
the way they did if we had badges.

27:00.720 --> 27:05.723
Oh, you mean badges like these?

27:05.725 --> 27:07.157
Are those real?

27:08.894 --> 27:11.128
I asked Turner for weeks to
let me issue them to you.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.330
Now that he's gone,
there's no reason not to.

27:13.332 --> 27:16.000
I figure since the need to both
have you in the field

27:16.002 --> 27:19.003
and the lab is clear,
these will come in handy.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.740
Uh, one more thing.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.409
Just because the badge is
in the shape of a shield

27:25.411 --> 27:27.511
does not mean it is one.
Protect yourself.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.913
Don't do anything stupid.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.684
Sweet. So, do we get,
like, guns too or...

27:33.686 --> 27:34.952
Don't push it.

27:34.954 --> 27:38.756
Sergeant, agents Clark...

27:38.758 --> 27:40.158
And Goodkin are ready to leave now.

27:43.596 --> 27:45.295
Oh, hey, Bonnie and Clyde!

27:45.297 --> 27:46.830
- How's life on the outside?
- Funny.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.799
Refractory period is up.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.467
Where you at on
re-sorting Turner's memories?

27:50.469 --> 27:51.602
Stamperson: Goodkin!

27:51.604 --> 27:54.271
My men were in that
damn panic room for an hour.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.840
You had no authority
to ditch your security detail.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.742
Ha! Actually, um...

27:59.812 --> 28:00.944
(Blows)

28:00.946 --> 28:02.780
This says I do.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.882
And it also gives me
the authority to tell you

28:04.884 --> 28:06.250
to get the hell out of my face.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.189
- Where did you get this?
- Maggie.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.691
Any luck defragging Turner's memory?

28:13.693 --> 28:15.993
Yes. I've re-indexed his memories

28:15.995 --> 28:17.361
using homogeneous coordinates.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.896
Then by implementing a scaling matrix,

28:18.898 --> 28:21.331
I'm able to rotate any object in
the stitch three-dimensionally.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.068
It should make Turner's memories
a more cohesive whole now.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.103
- "Should"?
- Only one way to find out.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.673
You know, I'm not sure that

28:29.675 --> 28:31.241
I'm used to this new Cameron yet.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.976
Yeah. Me neither.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.512
Hey, but seriously...

28:35.514 --> 28:36.780
Did you get a badge too?

28:38.050 --> 28:40.384
- (Giggles)
- How do I get one?

28:40.386 --> 28:42.306
You know, I think
you have to get arrested first.

28:43.422 --> 28:44.788
I could so do that!

28:48.928 --> 28:50.594
Talk to me, agent Carter. How is it?

28:50.596 --> 28:51.995
(Distorted chatter)

28:54.667 --> 28:56.066
Still wonky.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.168
Starting scaling matrix now.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.870
(Click)

28:59.872 --> 29:01.505
How's it look now?

29:03.843 --> 29:05.909
- Same memories as before.
- (Rattling)

29:05.911 --> 29:07.644
But better.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.881
Cameron, is there a memory
hot spot 15 years back?

29:10.883 --> 29:12.216
I'm looking...

29:12.218 --> 29:14.251
I don't care what happened
to him 15 years ago.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.853
I want to know who killed him yesterday.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.755
The computer in Turner's panic room

29:17.757 --> 29:19.256
was supposedly destroyed 15 years ago.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.525
Just gonna guess that has
something to do with his murder.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.760
Who's running this operation?

29:22.762 --> 29:24.094
The smart people. Go for it.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.562
Got it. Hold on, Kirsten.

29:25.564 --> 29:26.830
(Whirring)

29:29.702 --> 29:31.902
- (Alarm blares)
- Do something!

29:31.904 --> 29:33.403
(Overlapping chatter)

29:33.405 --> 29:34.905
Woman: Abort!

29:34.907 --> 29:36.073
Kirsten, what do you see?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.808
(Grunts)

29:37.810 --> 29:40.043
A pod of some kind.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.880
Now I'm getting voices.

29:42.882 --> 29:43.914
Linus?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.749
I'm working on it.

29:45.751 --> 29:46.917
Man: Get her out of there!

29:46.919 --> 29:48.719
- Man 2: I can't!
- Man 3: Project grasshopper!

29:48.721 --> 29:50.454
Shut it down!

29:50.456 --> 29:53.257
Okay, project grasshopper was
an experiment of some kind.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.892
- It failed...
- (Quick blipping)

29:54.894 --> 29:56.326
Heart rate's 180.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.061
- Cameron, get her out of there.
- Hold on, Kirsten.

29:58.063 --> 29:59.897
I'm moving you back
towards Turner's murder.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.565
(Whirring)

30:01.567 --> 30:03.500
(Maggie and Turner's
conversation overlapping)

30:03.502 --> 30:04.601
It's still not clear.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.470
I'm getting overlapping
images and sounds.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.238
You're the biggest threat
to the program.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.940
Damn right I moved the asset!

30:09.942 --> 30:11.008
It's protocol!

30:11.010 --> 30:12.142
I'd kill one to save 19.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.844
Am I the one you'd kill?

30:13.846 --> 30:15.479
I smell incense again.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.948
I'm rotating
the memory fragment further.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.283
She's gonna lose her lunch again.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.484
No, she's not.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.852
Okay, get the trash can.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.754
Okay, maybe she is.

30:23.756 --> 30:25.189
Just give it a sec to line up.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.924
Just breathe, Kirsten.
You're doing great.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.026
(Breathes slowly)

30:29.929 --> 30:31.261
No! Don't!

30:31.263 --> 30:32.429
(Gunshot)

30:32.431 --> 30:33.664
Kirsten, you okay?

30:34.834 --> 30:35.999
Does she see who killed Turner?

30:36.001 --> 30:37.134
Did you see who killed Turner?

30:37.136 --> 30:38.502
Yes.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.541
Maggie.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.019
Comtek. Now.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.287
Come on!

30:57.289 --> 30:58.822
Here.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.891
Kirsten, what the hell
are you talking about?

31:00.893 --> 31:02.659
I saw you shoot Turner.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.827
Then you saw wrong.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.128
I saw you.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.463
You killed him!

31:07.666 --> 31:08.866
Kirsten, you saw me in his memory

31:08.868 --> 31:09.867
because I was there that day,

31:09.869 --> 31:11.335
but I didn't kill Turner.

31:11.337 --> 31:14.204
Ms. baptiste, I think we have
some things to talk about.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.906
Look, the stitch is still active.

31:15.908 --> 31:16.974
We have three minutes left.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.175
(Clicking)

31:18.177 --> 31:21.178
Kirsten, whatever you saw, it was wrong.

31:21.180 --> 31:24.047
- Stand down! That's an order!
- Ms. baptiste, please cooperate.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.769
- No one wants things to escalate.
- Maggie!

31:29.188 --> 31:30.654
Let him go, baptiste!

31:31.724 --> 31:32.856
What's going on?

31:32.858 --> 31:35.158
I believe this is called
a Mexican standoff.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.360
Something's wrong with the stitch.

31:36.362 --> 31:37.594
I did not kill Turner.

31:37.596 --> 31:38.996
Linus, is there?

31:38.998 --> 31:39.930
I... I don't know!

31:39.932 --> 31:41.098
There could be!

31:41.100 --> 31:42.332
I am losing my patience!

31:42.334 --> 31:43.901
- Drop it!
- Linus, figure it out!

31:43.903 --> 31:45.068
You got two minutes!

31:45.070 --> 31:46.570
She's right.
There's still time. Kirsten?

31:46.572 --> 31:47.771
Let's do this.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.072
Linus?

31:49.074 --> 31:51.408
Look, it is hard to focus
with all these guns out!

31:51.410 --> 31:52.876
- (Whirring)
- Okay, try it.

31:52.878 --> 31:54.177
Okay, what do you see now, hot shot?

31:54.179 --> 31:55.545
(Whirring)

31:55.547 --> 31:56.980
(Crackling)

31:59.051 --> 32:00.751
Same thing. Maggie just shot him.

32:04.957 --> 32:05.889
That never happened.

32:05.891 --> 32:08.058
Wait. Cameron, replay that.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.359
Rolling back...

32:11.397 --> 32:12.863
Wait.

32:12.865 --> 32:15.799
The pieces are still moving.
They're out of sync.

32:15.801 --> 32:17.034
What does that mean?

32:17.036 --> 32:18.735
It means she can't be sure
Maggie was the shooter.

32:18.737 --> 32:19.836
40 seconds.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.105
Camille, take over for Cameron.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.073
- Excuse me?
- What?

32:23.075 --> 32:24.274
Just do it!

32:24.276 --> 32:25.709
Cameron, head to engineering!

32:25.711 --> 32:27.010
Come on! Move!

32:29.448 --> 32:31.114
- (Grunts)
- (Humphs)

32:31.116 --> 32:32.950
- You break it, you buy it.
- Shut up, Tim.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.119
What's going on?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.455
Turner's memory's exploded
into three dimensions.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.825
We need three separate controllers
to realign the fragments.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.828
I'm rerouting Turner's mind map
to all the terminals now.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.897
We need to rotate the pieces together.

32:46.899 --> 32:48.332
Okay? Just watch the map.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.900
It's like doing a 3-D Jigsaw puzzle.

32:49.902 --> 32:51.001
Ready?

32:51.003 --> 32:52.069
Go!

33:01.647 --> 33:02.846
(Whirring)

33:08.420 --> 33:10.787
- (Crackling)
- Incense.

33:10.789 --> 33:11.989
- (Beeping)
- Six seconds.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.153
Cameron: <i>Kirsten, make the bounce!</i>

33:20.466 --> 33:21.631
Well?

33:21.633 --> 33:23.100
I couldn't tell who it was,

33:23.102 --> 33:25.102
but I am sure it was not Maggie.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.770
(Sighs)

33:26.772 --> 33:28.205
- (Sighs)
- (Sighs)

33:29.475 --> 33:30.774
Stand down.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.011
How's it feel to save the day?

33:34.013 --> 33:36.113
(Sighs) Doesn't suck.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.148
Well, that was fun.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.817
If you're done screwing around,
can one of you geniuses

33:40.819 --> 33:43.220
please go figure out
who killed les Turner?

33:47.459 --> 33:49.126
Hey.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.528
Things got kind of cray. How you doin'?

33:51.530 --> 33:55.132
Like someone out of clues.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.666
Look, I know we're at
a dead end right now,

33:56.668 --> 33:58.135
but we will figure this out.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.403
We always do.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.005
Everything that's happened...

34:02.007 --> 34:05.409
Fisher getting shot, Turner killed,

34:05.411 --> 34:07.778
almost losing Cameron...

34:09.415 --> 34:11.447
I feel like...

34:12.751 --> 34:14.016
What?

34:14.018 --> 34:16.319
You started a sentence with "I feel."

34:16.321 --> 34:18.188
(Chuckles)

34:18.190 --> 34:19.589
I'm just still not used to that.

34:19.591 --> 34:22.092
Yeah, me neither.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.829
This whole...

34:25.831 --> 34:27.998
Emotions thing,

34:28.000 --> 34:29.533
how do you deal with it?

34:29.534 --> 34:30.833
Usually poorly.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.235
But I have found that

34:32.237 --> 34:34.071
homemade baked ziti with a
glass or three of red wine

34:34.072 --> 34:35.605
helps put things in perspective.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.074
- (Sighs)
- Come on.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.376
We'll go home,
bust open a bottle of Pinot,

34:39.378 --> 34:41.143
and figure out
this whole emotions thing.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.119
Did I mention that I cook, you clean?

34:49.121 --> 34:52.054
That's unfair. I have seen the
mess you make in a kitchen.

34:52.056 --> 34:54.190
Psh. Price you have to pay
for that ziti, though.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.692
(Beeping)

34:55.694 --> 34:56.760
(Sighs)

35:03.102 --> 35:05.135
- (Alarm rings)
- Kirsten?

35:05.137 --> 35:06.570
This readout.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.305
I saw it in Turner's memory.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.307
It stopped at 163.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.375
Um, that's here.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.178
Something on this level.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.617
Just... just hold it.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.020
- (Ding)
- Oh.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.269
Jeez, it's freezing.

35:39.271 --> 35:40.604
What's Turner keeping in here?

35:40.606 --> 35:42.005
(Lights buzzing)

35:43.942 --> 35:45.976
It's not a what.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.377
It's a who.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.098
What the hell is this place?

36:08.100 --> 36:10.100
I was hoping one of you could tell me.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.970
- That's...
- Ed Clark.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.105
Turner's had him here

36:15.107 --> 36:17.440
right under our noses since his murder.

36:17.442 --> 36:18.675
Why?

36:18.677 --> 36:20.277
Maggie: I didn't know
anything about this chamber.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.312
This is your lab!
How could you not know?

36:22.314 --> 36:24.548
- 'Cause I didn't.
- Son of a bitch built it.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.050
You knew about this?

36:28.320 --> 36:29.986
No. I mean, not exactly.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.721
Turner once asked if I could
build a drug protocol

36:31.723 --> 36:33.290
to extend the shelf life
of our subjects.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.325
Something about breaking
the four-day limit on viability.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.727
So, you helped him build this?

36:38.864 --> 36:40.230
And you didn't tell me?

36:40.232 --> 36:42.332
It was a theoretical conversation.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.733
I drew up some preliminary plans.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.035
I didn't know he was gonna use them.

36:45.037 --> 36:47.370
Well, he did, and Ed was a
guinea pig for your experiment.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.310
You told me that Ed was cremated.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.745
That his ashes were sent to
a distant sister somewhere.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.014
That's what I was told, too.

36:58.016 --> 37:00.150
Turner kept this secret from all of us.

37:00.152 --> 37:01.551
So what do we do?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.989
What I've wanted to do
since the very beginning.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.557
We stitch into Ed.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.093
We have no way of knowing
if his memories are even viable.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.929
Everything that's happened to us
began with Ed's murder.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.397
It started with Ed.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.266
Maybe he has answers.

37:18.904 --> 37:22.405
And nobody is going to stop me
from looking for them.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.944
Listen, Kirsten, with the new protocol,

37:27.946 --> 37:30.147
Ed's memories are impossible to map.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.349
So, we're gonna use the mind map that we
generated the first time we stitched into Ed.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.617
Is it safe?

37:33.619 --> 37:35.051
I'm not sure.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.187
But the moment it goes sideways,
I'm gonna bounce you.

37:37.189 --> 37:38.421
No, you're not.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.190
This stitch is mine.

37:42.127 --> 37:43.193
Fine.

37:52.271 --> 37:55.138
I've moved you to Ed's last
available memory. How's it look?

37:56.275 --> 37:59.109
Not good. Your drug protocol sucks.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.647
Wait... something's resolving.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.616
They're... they're fighting
over something.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.951
I'm not sure what.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.619
- Who's fighting?
- Who's fighting?

38:09.621 --> 38:12.355
It's... it's just not clear.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.258
Alex, on my signal, boost glutamate

38:15.260 --> 38:16.426
and atropine level to 100%.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.495
- You sure?
- Yes. Just do it. Linus?

38:18.497 --> 38:20.463
Linus, increase conductivity
to every sensory target zone.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.565
If you do this,
Ed's memory's gonna flame out.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.100
Look, there's barely anything left.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.435
Kirsten, brace yourself.

38:25.437 --> 38:26.670
We're firing every synapse
Ed's got left.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.971
Can Kirsten's mind take it?

38:27.973 --> 38:30.440
Okay, Kirsten, the rev 2 suit
is meant to protect you.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.723
It's made of tough stuff,
just like the person wearing it.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.916
- Go, Alex.
- (Whirring)

38:39.918 --> 38:42.018
- 100%.
- Linus, go.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.653
I hope you know what you're doin'.

38:46.258 --> 38:48.491
Ed: You've done enough to her!
I won't let you!

38:48.493 --> 38:50.327
She's suffered so much already!

38:50.329 --> 38:51.761
- (Gunshot)
- (Groans)

38:56.535 --> 38:57.534
I smell incense again.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.668
Done!

39:00.038 --> 39:01.371
(Breathes heavily)

39:03.041 --> 39:04.474
I didn't see the killer.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.710
But I did smell incense again

39:06.712 --> 39:08.144
just like in Turner's memory.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.380
Whoever killed Ed also killed Turner.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.282
I'm gonna increase security.

39:12.284 --> 39:14.217
You're not going anywhere
without an armed detail.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.052
- No.
- You don't get to tell me...

39:16.054 --> 39:17.454
Yes, I do.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.156
Look, we're not in any danger.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.292
Ed was trying to protect me,

39:22.294 --> 39:24.527
there was a fight over
Ed's gun, and it went off.

39:25.897 --> 39:28.164
That was three months ago.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.966
Okay, well, what about
the attack on Fisher?

39:29.968 --> 39:31.968
It was Barbiero.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.303
I mean, whoever he was working for

39:33.305 --> 39:35.505
tried to call it off,
but Barbiero wouldn't listen.

39:35.507 --> 39:36.373
And Turner?

39:36.375 --> 39:38.375
In the stitch, I heard something

39:38.377 --> 39:41.444
about Turner moving some asset
that the killer wanted.

39:42.547 --> 39:45.515
The voice on the phone,
she said that they would

39:45.517 --> 39:47.250
come for me when they think I'm ready.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.652
- Ready for what?
- To hear the truth.

39:49.654 --> 39:52.455
So what do we do until then?

39:54.259 --> 39:55.458
Our jobs.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.396
(Beeping)

40:05.937 --> 40:07.470
- (Alarm rings)
- (Creaking)

40:10.075 --> 40:11.941
I swear to you, I didn't know about Ed.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.812
I died for you.
What... why would I lie now?

40:18.083 --> 40:20.717
Everybody has their secrets.

40:20.719 --> 40:24.521
Maggie, Turner, Camille...

40:24.523 --> 40:26.089
Why not you?

40:26.091 --> 40:28.425
Tell me one thing I kept from you.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.860
- Cameron.
- No.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.530
You were inside my head.
What secrets did you see?

40:58.924 --> 41:01.391
I didn't see anything.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.461
I guess you're right.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.564
Everyone's got their secrets.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.401
- (Alarm rings)
- (Elevator resumes)

41:47.973 --> 41:49.038
Hey, dad.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.944
You missed a spot.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.546
I did?

42:02.821 --> 42:04.287
What's that smell?

42:04.289 --> 42:07.457
That is sandalwood. Do you like it?
