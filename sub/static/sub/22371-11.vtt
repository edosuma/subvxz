00:01.585 --> 00:03.917
(static crackling)

00:04.003 --> 00:07.372
(insects chirping)

00:07.466 --> 00:09.457
<i>Savior on radio:
Patrols, we got an Orange Situation.</i>

00:09.551 --> 00:11.167
<i>Dr. Carson and the priest.</i>

00:11.261 --> 00:13.593
<i>Might've split overnight,
maybe this morning.</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:16.547
<i>Jeremy's green sedan is MIA,
so could be in that.</i>

00:16.642 --> 00:18.258
<i>Go for standard
search and cover</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.013
<i>in our perimeter
around Hilltop.</i>

00:20.103 --> 00:21.559
- Eyeballs open.
- (static crackles)

00:21.647 --> 00:22.762
Patrol Four copies.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.722
Mel:
Come on, let's hurry it up.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.060
(engine starts)

00:48.006 --> 00:50.122
(breathes sharply)

00:50.217 --> 00:52.925
Best to stay off the roads,
head into the woods right there.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.718
Come on.
Go. Go.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.773
(walker growling)

01:07.859 --> 01:09.065
Tara: I got it.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.768
- Dwight: I'll cover you.
- (grunts)

01:12.155 --> 01:14.112
Tara!

01:14.199 --> 01:15.564
What?
It got away.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.195
He can handle it.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.697
(walker thuds)

01:18.787 --> 01:21.324
(blows landing)

01:21.415 --> 01:23.326
(breathing heavily)

01:23.417 --> 01:24.407
See?

01:24.501 --> 01:27.539
Hey.
Just keep 'em moving.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.048
Man:
Let's move out of here.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.838
Did you hear them talking on the walkie
about Carson and Gabriel?

01:38.932 --> 01:42.470
Yeah. Probably heading
to Hilltop, same as us.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.393
- (walker growling)
- Hopefully better than us.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.856
Dr. Carson: So, you have no idea
where we are?

01:49.943 --> 01:53.061
Gabriel:
Well, that depends.

01:53.155 --> 01:59.322
Have we passed the...
"Linus Overpass" yet?

01:59.411 --> 02:00.822
I don't know.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.495
I mean, maybe last night.
It was dark. We...

02:03.582 --> 02:05.823
(scraping, clinking in distance)

02:05.917 --> 02:08.157
Did you hear that?

02:08.252 --> 02:09.618
Hear what?

02:09.713 --> 02:12.796
(walker growling)

02:17.012 --> 02:18.173
Why are you...?

02:18.263 --> 02:20.630
Do you normally
wear glasses?

02:20.724 --> 02:22.931
No.
lj-just--

02:23.018 --> 02:24.634
ls your vision blurring?

02:24.728 --> 02:26.184
(growling softly)

02:26.271 --> 02:29.514
If this infection is attacking
your optical nerves,

02:29.608 --> 02:31.019
it could permanently damage
your eyesight. We--

02:31.109 --> 02:32.599
We're doing what
we're supposed to be doing.

02:32.694 --> 02:36.358
And you're supposed to be back
at the Hilltop for Maggie.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.031
It's going to be okay.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.573
All of it.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.949
Just have some faith.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.656
We're on the right path,
even if we're on the wrong road.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.332
Look.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.331
You have a serious complication,
and we are dangerously lost.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.628
Do you really think God
is leading the way?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.712
He's always leading
the way.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.505
(scoffs lightly)

03:02.599 --> 03:03.634
Great.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.386
That's great.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.184
Well, maybe we should let Him
drive for a little while.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.760
(walker growling,
chain scraping)

03:08.855 --> 03:11.347
I mean, we should
let him inside.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.681
Been leaving
all those footprints

03:12.776 --> 03:15.393
along the side of the road.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.854
Uaughs)

03:17.948 --> 03:20.280
(growling continues)

03:20.367 --> 03:24.031
(breathing heavily)

03:24.121 --> 03:26.112
(engine sputtering)

03:26.206 --> 03:29.119
(suspenseful music plays)

03:39.219 --> 03:40.960
(theme music playing)

04:21.595 --> 04:24.383
(bird chirping)

04:32.189 --> 04:36.228
All right, what about that
mile marker... right there?

04:36.318 --> 04:38.685
Can you see
that from here?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.985
No.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.028
(scoffs)
Stupid.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.276
Stupid.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.277
I was stupid
to let you leave that place.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.489
Then why did you?

04:47.579 --> 04:48.944
Because you're sick.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.621
I stashed away
some antibiotics at the Hilltop

04:50.707 --> 04:51.913
before we were raided.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.161
Well, then,
there isn't any reason

04:53.251 --> 04:54.616
why they aren't
still there.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.370
We'll find another car,

04:57.464 --> 05:00.627
- we'll get there, and then we'll--
- (clanking in distance)

05:02.302 --> 05:04.088
What?

05:04.179 --> 05:06.591
You hear that?

05:06.681 --> 05:08.513
(clanking)

05:08.600 --> 05:10.762
There.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.718
(clanking continues)

05:12.813 --> 05:15.396
Almost like a bell.

05:18.777 --> 05:22.361
(insects chirping)

05:22.447 --> 05:24.484
(clanking, walker growling)

05:24.574 --> 05:26.815
We shouldn't risk
leaving the road.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.990
Look out.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.949
(growlinQl)

05:35.043 --> 05:37.284
It's coming
from up here.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.869
Gabriel!

05:38.964 --> 05:41.626
(clanging continues)

05:53.144 --> 05:58.139
It's not a bell, but this place
may just be our salvation.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.351
Gabriel, this place does not
scream salvation.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.242
Hey.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.411
Daryl.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.659
Where are they?

06:14.749 --> 06:16.035
They needed rest.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.412
They're exhausted.
They haven't slept.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.913
(scoffs)

06:19.004 --> 06:21.666
All right, 10 minutes.
Then we keep goin'.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.463
I'm gonna go back,
cover our tracks.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.585
I'll go with you.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.758
I have a question.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.927
Is there a reason
why he's still breathing?

06:29.014 --> 06:30.095
Fight ain't over.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.171
It is for him.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.301
I'm done waiting.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.305
Not now.
Not yet.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.226
He's right.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.478
Dwight could have
an angle we don't know about.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.275
He could help.
He wants to.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.772
Can't give that up yet.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.691
We just lost the kid.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.197
Let's just stop.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.370
At least until we get
to the Hilltop.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.711
(indistinct conversations)

07:05.800 --> 07:09.464
(metal clanking)

07:22.233 --> 07:24.770
(hammer pounding)

07:27.322 --> 07:29.279
I can take over,
Morgan.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.107
Don't need to.

07:31.201 --> 07:34.785
But maybe you can
make Henry eat something.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.862
I'm fine.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.699
Maybe you can,
and I can take over.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.207
Jared: Morgan?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.628
It's Morgan, right?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.672
The kid is creeping people out.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.467
Maybe you can, you know,
move him along.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.805
Listen, you don't want him here.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.757
Saviors are gonna roll up
and let us out,

07:56.851 --> 07:59.889
and, hell...
it ain't gonna be pretty.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.766
Which one of you killed
my brother?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.394
Carol:
Go find Jerry.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.856
Tell him to get
you something to eat.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.861
- But I don't wa--
- Hey.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.199
(hammering continues)

08:22.711 --> 08:24.543
Why don't we tell him?

08:26.715 --> 08:28.706
You know why.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.792
He's a child.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.217
He's done
too much already.

08:34.304 --> 08:37.297
He's gonna live
'cause he knows how.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.934
Doesn't bother him.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.604
He's fine with it.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.431
He's not.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.061
He just doesn't
know it yet.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.564
He's not fine, Morgan,
and you aren't, either.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.233
Take a break.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.164
(hammer pounding)

09:06.254 --> 09:09.167
(conversations continue)

09:15.764 --> 09:18.222
I'm disappointed, Eugene.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.470
This crap was supposed
to be behind us.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.348
Two flushes and out the pipe.

09:23.438 --> 09:26.180
Top it all off,

09:26.274 --> 09:29.187
my only doctor
and that creepy-ass priest

09:29.277 --> 09:30.938
somehow managed to jump ship

09:31.029 --> 09:34.772
without anybody knowing
about it.

09:38.244 --> 09:41.157
(chair creaks lightly)

09:48.755 --> 09:52.794
You have any idea how something
like that could happen, Eugene?

09:52.884 --> 09:56.969
No, I would not
venture to guess.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.467
Carson was never one of us.

09:59.557 --> 10:03.050
He was a weasel,
just like his weasel brother.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.306
That's my best stab at it.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.104
Drawing together
associations and behaviors--

10:08.191 --> 10:10.523
that's a solid stab.
(breathes deeply)

10:10.610 --> 10:14.103
Well, once their asses are
caught and dragged back here--

10:14.197 --> 10:16.689
and they will be--

10:16.783 --> 10:19.775
I'm gonna get
the whole story out of 'em.

10:19.869 --> 10:25.160
One way or another,
yes, I will.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.663
And Alexandria--
what went down there?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.464
Do you care?

10:40.056 --> 10:44.015
Do you care, Eugene,

10:44.102 --> 10:48.016
after they tried to blow you
off the face of this Earth?

10:48.106 --> 10:49.517
Your message
is stamped "received"

10:49.607 --> 10:51.097
and very much appreciated.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.728
Oh, well, good.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.560
You see, I got some news
for you, Eugene.

10:54.654 --> 10:59.615
You are gonna be in charge
of your very own outpost.

10:59.701 --> 11:03.490
You see, I need
my bullet maker making bullets.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.698
Cutting a path through the dead
took a toll on our reserves.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.829
So now you get
the honors of providing me

11:09.919 --> 11:12.456
with the necessary
bang-bang I'm gonna need

11:12.547 --> 11:17.462
to settle this whole
situation with Rick for good.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.463
And all that about people
being resources and whatnot?

11:22.557 --> 11:25.265
(chuckles)

11:25.351 --> 11:27.718
Bullets are the last resort.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.428
I mean, hell,

11:29.522 --> 11:32.389
Lucille here--
she gets first dibs.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.316
But if Rick
and his merry band of pricks

11:38.406 --> 11:40.693
decide to pull some shit,

11:40.783 --> 11:42.114
then we're gonna
have to pull some right back

11:42.202 --> 11:43.442
that we'd rather not.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.119
That'll be on them.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.992
Not you.
Not me.

11:51.085 --> 11:55.420
I'm gonna set you up at that
machine shop that you told me about.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.749
You're gonna have a full
security detail at your disposal--

11:58.843 --> 12:02.586
everything that you need
to keep your head in the game.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.967
Got Frankie there
giving you massages...

12:05.058 --> 12:06.765
Tanya cooking.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.309
You know that gal
was a chef?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.352
I pictured her
in social sciences.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.851
Management.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.525
Maybe running
a drapes factory.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.817
Will there be wine?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.279
There will, indeed.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.702
(object clatters lightly)

12:34.420 --> 12:35.876
(coins jingling)

12:35.964 --> 12:39.252
(chuckles)

12:39.342 --> 12:41.800
(piggy bank thumps softly)

12:56.859 --> 12:58.315
(door opens)

12:58.403 --> 12:59.609
(footsteps approach)

12:59.696 --> 13:01.812
It's clear?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.396
So far.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.695
What are you doing?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.700
Trying to read
what this says.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.953
You need to be lying down
on that couch.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.501
You're lucky we found
this place when we did.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.500
Luck had nothing
to do with this.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.251
The person
who lived here,

13:21.342 --> 13:24.676
they were
a radio operator.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.719
It could tell us something
about where we are.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.264
"To anyone who can hear
my voice,

13:29.350 --> 13:30.340
know that you're not alone.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.675
Please hold on.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.351
We can make it through this
if we don't give up.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.475
If we keep believing..."
I mean, it's just a script.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.522
It's not gonna help us.
Maybe not.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.269
But it sounds
like it helped others.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.443
Look. "No signal,"
"no signal," "no signal."

13:42.530 --> 13:46.239
I mean, going by the logs,
I don't think so.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.658
It still might have.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.861
Maybe this person reached
other people

13:50.955 --> 13:52.662
and never found out.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.867
Maybe just by saying it
over and over again,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.450
this person had reason
to believe it.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.788
Maybe it gave them
the strength to go on,

14:00.882 --> 14:03.499
even if they didn't reach
anyone else.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.512
(growling softly)

14:09.599 --> 14:13.217
Dr. Carson: Yeah...
That didn't happen.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.982
If they're smart,
they'll cover all these passes

14:22.070 --> 14:23.481
between here and Hilltop.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.523
We have to keep moving.
We'll just have to risk it.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.780
Maybe you don't have to.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.410
Negan won't send

14:33.498 --> 14:37.162
his people down
into this stretch of swamp,

14:37.251 --> 14:40.915
not if he doesn't have to.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.588
Yeah?
How do you know that?

14:43.674 --> 14:46.211
Negan wanted to map
the best routes with cover

14:46.302 --> 14:48.293
from the Sanctuary
to the Hilltop.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.880
He-- He decided
the swamp was too dangerous.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.385
Didn't think
it was worth the risk.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.942
You aren't seriously
gonna listen to him.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.902
It's too dangerous
for the Saviors,

15:06.989 --> 15:08.400
so you're gonna send us?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.983
- Are you kidding me?
- (scoffs)

15:11.077 --> 15:13.409
They have us boxed in.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.362
Tobin:
Tara has a point.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.823
Why should we trust him?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.284
He could turn on us like
he turned on his own people.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.916
I didn't just turn on 'em.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.917
I killed 'em.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.340
Daryl saw it.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.172
Rosita saw it.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.889
You saw it.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.858
But one of them
got away...

15:44.944 --> 15:48.278
So if they find me,
Negan puts my head on a pike.

15:48.364 --> 15:52.358
I'm not working for them,
and I'm not going back to them.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.411
I chose my side.
This is it.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.738
I'm here to help
you beat Negan.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.244
After that...

16:03.254 --> 16:06.997
well, I know how it ends.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.219
All right.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.099
We try the swamps.

16:37.079 --> 16:42.415
(babbling)

16:42.502 --> 16:44.243
- (door opens)
- Dianne: Hey.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.294
Bertie and I finished
the inventory.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.586
(door creaks)

16:47.673 --> 16:49.414
How bad?

16:51.052 --> 16:54.386
By our count, you're gonna have
to cut rations by another third

16:54.472 --> 16:56.338
just to make it
through the week.

16:56.432 --> 17:00.141
This number include
the prisoners?

17:01.979 --> 17:04.767
It's worse if you include
the prisoners.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.692
Jesus is still
out scavenging.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.362
He could
bring back something.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.617
(door opens)

17:22.625 --> 17:24.366
(blows)

17:24.460 --> 17:26.622
(clicking)

17:26.712 --> 17:29.079
I told you--
you need to be lying down.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.130
I'm fine.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.958
Gabriel,
you have to listen to me.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.759
You are fighting
a serious infection.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.006
And you need
to be in there--

17:36.097 --> 17:38.555
Can you read
what any of these are?

17:38.641 --> 17:41.429
(pills rattling)

17:41.519 --> 17:43.851
(pill bottles clacking)

17:51.487 --> 17:53.273
What?

17:53.364 --> 17:55.355
(breathes sharply)

18:01.872 --> 18:04.455
These are both antibiotics.

18:04.542 --> 18:08.285
(breathes sharply) This man
may have just saved your life.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.924
I'm not saying a word.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.343
This works,
it don't change shit.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.392
Everything I did,
it was for Sherry.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.060
That doesn't make it right.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.640
Or something that should be forgiven.
But it's the truth.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.691
Only one I got left.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.983
She's the one
that let you out.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.435
Then she ran.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.520
She's out here?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.856
Somewhere.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.816
I hope.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.747
(suspenseful music plays)

18:59.180 --> 19:01.763
(walker growling)

19:08.773 --> 19:11.105
We have to be careful,

19:11.192 --> 19:13.809
but we can do this.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.941
Daryl: Push through.
Clear a path for the others.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.237
Count me in.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.065
I'll go.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.901
If I can have the crossbow--

19:22.995 --> 19:26.454
You can't.
You'll stay right there.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.534
You coming?

19:33.923 --> 19:37.791
I'm gonna hang back,
watch out for the group.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.843
Daryl: Come on.
Let's get this done.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.311
(hammering)

19:58.406 --> 20:00.864
(indistinct conversations)

20:00.950 --> 20:03.191
(metal groans)

20:05.371 --> 20:06.611
Margret.
Thank you for speaking with me.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.322
What do you want,
Gregory?

20:08.416 --> 20:12.034
I know we haven't exactly seen
eye-to-eye on anything.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.587
Loyalties have been questioned,
fingers have been pointed...

20:15.673 --> 20:19.416
All of that aside,
you have to admit

20:19.510 --> 20:20.875
that, since you threw
me in here,

20:20.970 --> 20:23.462
my behavior
has been pretty good.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.046
You're staying in,
Gregory.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.256
What?

20:26.350 --> 20:27.715
So you're not
gonna hear me out?

20:27.810 --> 20:29.517
You can't just
leave me in here forever.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.810
Give me a reason to kill you,
and I won't have to.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.888
He's right, you know.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.520
(hammering continues)

20:36.610 --> 20:38.021
We've been good.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.694
We've done everything
you've told us to do.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.111
And still, last night,
you took one of us out and--

20:41.198 --> 20:42.780
Yeah,
I know what I did.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.280
Okay-

20:47.371 --> 20:48.907
The longer you treat us
like the enemy,

20:48.998 --> 20:50.989
- the more we're gonna act--
- You are the enemy.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.246
I don't think we have to be.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.997
What do you want?

21:01.218 --> 21:04.586
Time outside the pen
for good behavior.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.422
You know, one at a time,
a couple minutes a day,

21:07.516 --> 21:10.804
some-- some shade,
exercise.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.431
You can have
all the guns on us you like.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.886
What do you say?

21:13.981 --> 21:16.439
I don't have
the resources to oblige you,

21:16.525 --> 21:18.436
even if I wanted to.

21:18.527 --> 21:22.111
So, that's it, then?

21:22.198 --> 21:24.610
No.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.782
I'm cutting off your rations.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.156
A few days,
maybe longer.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.578
- Gregory: What?
- Maggie...

21:31.665 --> 21:34.248
My people come first.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.793
I don't have a choice.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.745
I think you do.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.924
(metal clatters)

21:47.014 --> 21:48.925
(water sloshing)

21:49.016 --> 21:52.259
(insects chirping)

21:55.189 --> 21:58.102
(suspenseful music plays)

22:17.503 --> 22:19.494
(growling)

22:19.588 --> 22:22.205
(grunting)

22:23.884 --> 22:25.966
(breathing heavily)

22:34.436 --> 22:37.019
(walkers growling, burbling)

22:53.873 --> 22:56.205
Maybe we can go around?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.828
The shallowest spot's
straight ahead.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.579
We clear 'em out. That's how
we get our people through.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.751
You ready?
Yeah.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.751
(walkers growling)

23:03.841 --> 23:07.209
(flesh tearing)

23:09.054 --> 23:12.046
(walker growling)

23:25.362 --> 23:27.353
Who wants to help me
take care of that?

23:30.576 --> 23:34.490
Congratulations.
You just volunteered.

23:50.095 --> 23:54.805
Well... your fever appears
to have broken...

23:54.892 --> 23:56.883
(sighs)

23:56.977 --> 24:00.641
But your eyesight...

24:00.731 --> 24:03.314
Well, if there's not
some improvement soon,

24:03.400 --> 24:05.858
I'm afraid you're looking
at permanent damage.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.527
I'm sorry.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.524
You're sorry I'm going to live?

24:09.615 --> 24:12.107
(scoffs)
You know what I mean.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.868
Losing your vision.
In this.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.696
The thought of that
doesn't scare you?

24:17.790 --> 24:22.125
Or... piss you off,
even a little bit?

24:22.211 --> 24:24.452
I'm letting Him lead
the way.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.580
(chuckles)

24:27.675 --> 24:29.541
I can't even see it,

24:29.635 --> 24:33.344
but I can feel
the look on your face.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.761
(sighs)

24:34.848 --> 24:38.057
I'm not saying
God led us to this place.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.511
That this
is some scavenger hunt

24:41.605 --> 24:44.563
He's put us on.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.812
But to search
for meaning in this moment

24:46.902 --> 24:49.610
simply by looking
around...

24:49.697 --> 24:51.608
Or-- Or feeling--

24:51.699 --> 24:54.942
(bank shatters)

24:55.035 --> 24:56.946
You gotta be shitting me.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.948
What?

25:07.589 --> 25:09.546
It's car keys and a map.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.794
Here we go...

25:14.888 --> 25:17.505
Barrington House
Living History Museum.

25:17.599 --> 25:22.685
We-- We can't be more
than a few miles off.

25:22.771 --> 25:27.015
(growling)

25:27.109 --> 25:28.520
(growling stops)

25:28.610 --> 25:30.351
(walker thuds)

25:32.031 --> 25:33.362
You could cover me
with the knife.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.111
I could, but I'm covering you
with this.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.114
(growling in distance)

25:40.748 --> 25:41.738
Last one.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.368
Sure you don't want it?

25:43.459 --> 25:45.700
And waste a bullet?
No thanks.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.757
I'm sorry about Denise.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.299
(growling approaches)

25:54.386 --> 25:56.423
I truly am. I don't
expect you to forgive me.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.969
I don't deserve it.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.764
I just wanted you to know,
that's all.

25:59.850 --> 26:00.885
(growling)

26:00.976 --> 26:01.966
' (growling stops)
- (grunts)

26:02.061 --> 26:03.176
(walker thuds)

26:03.270 --> 26:05.181
(breathing heavily)

26:07.649 --> 26:11.142
You should've stayed
with the Saviors.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.568
(knife thumps softly)

26:13.655 --> 26:16.113
I hate 'em.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.690
I hate Negan.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.526
Don't care.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.987
You don't get to switch sides
and make it okay.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.788
I know I don't.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.285
I never will.

26:25.375 --> 26:30.791
But killing me right now,
like this...

26:32.925 --> 26:35.508
What's that gonna do?

26:37.513 --> 26:39.220
It's gonna make me feel
a hell of a lot better.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.592
(gunshon

26:57.699 --> 27:01.613
(panting)

27:16.844 --> 27:18.881
I knew
it was gonna happen.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.882
(panting)

27:20.973 --> 27:24.011
I just wanted
to help you win first.

27:24.101 --> 27:28.470
Man: Just sayin' they'd be idiots
to risk it is all.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.931
Least we can say
we checked...

27:31.024 --> 27:34.107
Man #2: Still rather be us
than J-Money right now.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.074
Let's hope the car's
actually in the garage.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.030
It is.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.124
(metal clangs intermittently)

28:08.562 --> 28:11.475
(suspenseful music plays)

28:14.902 --> 28:18.361
(metal clanging)

28:24.369 --> 28:26.485
Dr. Carson!
Stop! Wait!

You-- You-- You did it.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.237
(chuckles)

29:52.332 --> 29:54.494
I think I might
have had some help.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.825
Uaughs)

30:11.351 --> 30:14.309
Man: The swamp's that way.
Let's cut through there.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.978

Dwight?

30:28.535 --> 30:30.492
Woman:
The hell happened to you?

30:30.579 --> 30:32.320
We thought
you were dead!

30:32.414 --> 30:35.156
It was an ambush.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.662
You know, they shot us
to hell, but I got away.

30:37.753 --> 30:41.838
(breathing heavily)
Spent the whole night hiding...

30:41.923 --> 30:44.290
You know,
running from the dead ones...

30:44.384 --> 30:46.671
Trying to make it back.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.759
What happened to Laura?

30:51.850 --> 30:54.262
I thought she mighta
made it out, too.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.435
Yeah, I'm sorry, D.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.104
No one's seen her.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.726
So, what are you doing out here?

31:03.820 --> 31:05.811
Man:
Trackin' the Alexandrians.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.147
Woman: 'Bout to check the swamp,
see what we can see.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.357
I just came from there.

31:10.452 --> 31:13.786
They were smart enough
to steer clear.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.159
Now, if I were them,

31:16.249 --> 31:18.081
I'd stick closer to Burke's Pass.

31:18.168 --> 31:21.001
Good cover,
straighter shot.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.295
Yeah.
Yeah, lead the way, D.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.089
Barely recognized you
without your vest.

31:25.175 --> 31:28.384
Woman: Lucky we didn't
shoot your ass.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.590
What were you doing?

31:34.684 --> 31:36.550
Making sure you were okay.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.511
I saw you running after him.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.516
Why didn't you try
and stop me?

31:42.651 --> 31:45.018
No one could've
stopped me.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.816
I told you to wait!

31:54.371 --> 31:56.078
For all we know, he could
be tellin' 'em everything!

31:56.164 --> 31:58.246
Negan could be on his way here
right now!

31:58.333 --> 32:00.791
He isn't.
He won't.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.242
He led them away.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.328
They were coming right for us,
and he saved us.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.085
She's right. He did.
I saw it.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.340
I don't give a damn
what he did.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.640
He can stick with them,

32:15.725 --> 32:17.466
he can come back--
hell, he can run.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.893
When I find that son of a bitch,
I'm gonna--

32:24.609 --> 32:26.270
<i>(Simon.</i>

32:39.458 --> 32:42.075
You, uh, sure you don't
want me to drive?

32:42.169 --> 32:43.580
I really don't mind.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.377
(both chuckle)

32:45.464 --> 32:48.206
Yeah, I'm sure.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.338
(grunts)

33:01.771 --> 33:04.513
(breathing heavily)

33:04.608 --> 33:06.519
(sighs)
Thanks.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.609
(weapons cock)

33:09.696 --> 33:11.733
Derek:
Hands up, assholes.

33:18.163 --> 33:21.872
(grunting)

33:21.958 --> 33:25.826
(panting)

33:30.425 --> 33:33.258
They must've heard
the gunfire.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.007
He's still leading
the way.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.839
Believe it,
and you'll see it.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.394
I think I do see it.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.526
(gunshon

33:55.617 --> 33:57.904
C'mon, man!
That's the doctor, damn it!

33:57.994 --> 33:59.655
That's our asses.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.953
Get your damn gun,
and get in the cab.

34:06.586 --> 34:07.792
(body thuds)

34:07.879 --> 34:08.960
No.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.879
Let's get
the hell out of here.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.127
(crying) No.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.754
(truck doors open, close)

34:14.844 --> 34:15.958
No.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.965
(engine starts)

34:20.141 --> 34:22.052
No.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.599
(crying)

34:35.447 --> 34:38.531
(somber music plays)

36:05.413 --> 36:06.995
How did he die?

36:08.792 --> 36:10.829
Was it them?

36:12.587 --> 36:16.046
He was helping
a stranger.

36:16.132 --> 36:19.500
In the middle of all this,
he was helping a stranger.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.336
(hammer pounding)

36:25.558 --> 36:27.925
You asked about your brother.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.351
Who killed him.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.765
It was Gavin.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.272
And you got him, so...

36:51.918 --> 36:53.875
(sniffles)

36:53.962 --> 36:58.581
(indistinct conversations)

36:58.675 --> 37:01.508
(hammer pounding)

37:06.391 --> 37:08.803
Sorry.

37:08.893 --> 37:13.057
Just wanted to thank you
for your hospitality.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.727
It's not much.

37:16.818 --> 37:19.230
You're wrong.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.482
It's everything.

37:23.783 --> 37:28.277
Do you have a hospital here,
some kind of infirmary?

37:28.371 --> 37:30.328
Are you hurt?

37:30.415 --> 37:34.033
(scoffs)
No, I'm fine.

37:34.127 --> 37:38.166
I just...
have some medical experience.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.624
Thought I could pitch in
and help.

37:41.718 --> 37:45.461
In the trailers.
Thank you.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.176
(hammer pounding)

37:53.271 --> 37:56.354
(indistinct conversations)

38:06.785 --> 38:11.871
(metal creaking rhythmically)

38:11.956 --> 38:14.539
(clinking)

38:17.420 --> 38:20.788
Well, look at you,
Mr. Big Shot.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.839
You were destined for this.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.754
Nobody on the line without gloves
and proper eye protection.

38:32.185 --> 38:33.516
I just thought
I could help.

38:33.603 --> 38:34.889
Maybe you could show me
how to make one.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.811
You can help
by taking my dinner order,

38:36.898 --> 38:39.435
relaying it to Tanya
via the longrange.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.439
Eggs will do nicely.
Dancing with tomatoes.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.645
One tomato omelet--
you got it.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.322
No fold over.
I'm talkin' a scramble.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.024
Several of them, actually.
For my crew.

38:49.118 --> 38:52.361
No damn tomatoes.
Peppers, lots of 'em.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.037
As many as you got.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.114
You heard the man.

38:56.209 --> 38:59.747
And I'd like said repast
set up over here,

38:59.838 --> 39:01.624
in the Northwest corner,
which I hereby

39:01.714 --> 39:04.957
designate as this workplace's
official cafeteria, break room,

39:05.051 --> 39:07.338
and motivational
presentational cubby.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.681
And my brow will soon
be in need of wiping.

39:16.771 --> 39:20.309
(door thuds open)

39:20.400 --> 39:21.982
Ha, ha.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.856
Lookee what I found.

39:24.946 --> 39:28.564
And he told me
a very interesting story

39:28.658 --> 39:31.650
about how he made his way
out of our lovely home.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.334
It was Carson.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.710
Did I call it or what?

39:49.804 --> 39:52.762
I am 89°9-

39:52.849 --> 39:54.715
But why bring him here?

39:54.809 --> 39:56.391
Well, you need
an extra set of hands

39:56.477 --> 39:59.060
to sort out
those bullet casings, right?

39:59.147 --> 40:01.184
Apparently, his eyes
don't work for shit,

40:01.274 --> 40:04.733
but he does have
a set of hands.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.981
We'll see if it helps.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.812
I only have a few bullets
as it is--

40:08.907 --> 40:11.990
quality munitions,
but the quantity is full-on scant.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.532
It's still gonna be
a few more days

40:13.620 --> 40:16.112
before we have any sort
of supply to speak of.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.071
(sighs)

40:18.166 --> 40:20.749
(sucks teeth)

40:20.835 --> 40:23.702
See, Eugene...

40:23.796 --> 40:27.334
that simply
doesn't work for me.

40:29.052 --> 40:31.009
I think a more biblical approach

40:31.095 --> 40:33.382
for maximum fright
may be in order.

40:33.473 --> 40:37.637
We could rig several
medieval-style catapults,

40:37.727 --> 40:41.345
start launching undead arms,
legs, torsos over their defenses,

40:41.439 --> 40:45.148
maybe heads or, you know,
big piles of guts.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.225
You know, pure psych-ops.

40:47.320 --> 40:51.188
I mean, there's some really
traumatic theatrics there.

41:04.629 --> 41:05.835
Thank you.

41:08.007 --> 41:12.922
I do believe a rose just sprang
out of that pile of shit.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.970
Let's roll.

41:16.057 --> 41:18.264
Big day tomorrow.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.850
(whistling)

41:24.941 --> 41:26.602
(door closes)

41:33.866 --> 41:36.449
I thought--

41:36.536 --> 41:40.029
I thought I found it.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.864
What I was meant to do--

41:43.543 --> 41:45.625
You have.

41:45.712 --> 41:47.953
So have I.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.129
Now get sortin'.

41:53.720 --> 41:57.008
(clapping hands)
Let's pick up the pace.

41:57.098 --> 42:00.181
(hammer pounding in distance)

42:06.774 --> 42:08.765
(metal clanks)

42:15.366 --> 42:17.232
Prisoners
will be taken out in pairs,

42:17.326 --> 42:18.942
under armed guard,

42:19.037 --> 42:23.076
for work, exercise, and,
if necessary, medical attention.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.498
(chain clinks)

42:25.585 --> 42:27.952
You'll start
by cleaning the stables.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.036
What about food?

42:29.130 --> 42:30.586
Quarter rations--

42:30.673 --> 42:32.414
- same as all of us.
- Margret--

42:32.508 --> 42:35.421
Don't say anything that'll
make me put you back in there.

42:35.511 --> 42:39.721
No. I-l appreciate this.
I-l do.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.344
The Saviors are still coming.

42:42.435 --> 42:44.346
Barely any food left,

42:44.437 --> 42:47.646
supplies just stretched out
to nothing.

42:47.732 --> 42:50.440
M-Maybe we ought
to consider evacuation.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.526
Evacuation?

42:53.613 --> 42:56.526
Yeah.
We run, we live.

42:56.616 --> 42:59.199
I mean... how can we win?

42:59.285 --> 43:02.403
Look around, Gregory.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.033
How can we lose?

43:04.123 --> 43:07.206
Kal: Open the gates!
It's Rick!

43:13.508 --> 43:16.466
(walkers growling)

43:16.552 --> 43:20.511
You all know how it works.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.760
You get a bite,

43:22.850 --> 43:25.717
some kind of wound
from one of these things,

43:25.812 --> 43:29.555
something from them gets
in you, and you die.

43:29.649 --> 43:32.232
You join the club...

43:32.318 --> 43:34.229
which sucks.

43:36.322 --> 43:39.815
What if we could use
that to our advantage?

43:39.909 --> 43:41.946
(growling)

43:42.036 --> 43:43.743
(liquid dripping)

43:51.003 --> 43:54.712
Ah, you see how Lucille
is getting to know

43:54.799 --> 43:58.008
our beautiful, cold friend here?

44:00.930 --> 44:04.844
(growling)

44:04.934 --> 44:08.598
That's it.

44:11.691 --> 44:13.773
(chuckles)

44:17.947 --> 44:21.235
(walkers growling)

44:21.325 --> 44:26.991
Look... at... that.

44:27.081 --> 44:29.072
No more smashing and bashing.

44:29.167 --> 44:32.751
With this-- Well, this,
it can just be a touch.

44:32.837 --> 44:37.331
Or a big, wet kiss.

44:37.425 --> 44:40.008
Either way,
this gets you full membership,

44:40.094 --> 44:41.175
and that's what we want.

44:41.262 --> 44:44.471
We want people to join the club.

44:44.557 --> 44:48.596
Hilltop is gonna learn to toe
the line one way or another,

44:48.686 --> 44:51.974
dead or alive...

44:55.318 --> 44:58.902
...or some kinda shit
in between.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.649
(theme music playing)
