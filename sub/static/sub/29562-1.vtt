02:47.735 --> 02:49.001
it's the Handy Dandy day show.

It's you, isn't it?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.884

there you stand.

Come back for more,

03:10.691 --> 03:11.790

03:13.928 --> 03:16.461
More death to give
you more life.

03:16.463 --> 03:19.631
And this fucking blood
moon gives you the moment

03:19.633 --> 03:21.233
you've been waiting for, right?

03:23.003 --> 03:24.403
Well I'm here to kill you.

(laughing and talking)

06:31.725 --> 06:34.126
- Sorry.
- Of course.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.728
- Rick, that was
fucking awesome man.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.296
- Wanted to hang out with
you guys one more time

06:38.298 --> 06:41.700
before we send our man Rosie
off to fame and fortune.

06:41.702 --> 06:42.968
- He's going back to school.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.536
Fame and fortune's
next year player.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.904
- That's what I'm sayin'.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.272
- Oh, I just got it.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.507
- You're Roosevelt Smith.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.609
I saw that game with
you in it against USC

06:50.611 --> 06:53.311
and you were amazing.
- Amazing, yes, we know.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.447
Rosie's been amazing
since we were 10.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.783
- Hey, look at the moon.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.652
- Oh, that's a super blood moon.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.988
First one in 50 years.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.056
- What the hell's
a super blood moon?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.793
- God, get a weather app.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.094
- Doc, will you just drop it?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.929
You two have been
at it all night.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.899
- It's a cool moon.

07:14.868 --> 07:15.767
- Yeah,

07:16.737 --> 07:18.270
I know it is.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.339
- That guitarist
was fucking insane.

07:21.341 --> 07:24.042
- Yeah, that drummer
was pretty hot too.

07:26.113 --> 07:26.945
What?

07:26.947 --> 07:27.846
I'm just saying.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.714
- Stick to robots, Doc.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.485
- Hey, guys, just ignore him.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.719
I do.

07:34.721 --> 07:35.654
- That usherette, hot.

07:36.957 --> 07:37.889
- Yeah.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.157
- Our Josie has a little crush.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.761
- Always got a crush on someone.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.963
- Rick, it's too far.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.331
Can you carry me?

07:46.333 --> 07:47.799
- Sure, climb on.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.034
- Okay.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.369
(laughing)

07:54.942 --> 07:55.841
- I hate him.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.111
- Wait, wait, wait, Rick?

08:00.113 --> 08:00.979
Since when?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.616
- Two weeks and five days ago.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.853
- What are you talking about?

08:07.855 --> 08:10.121
- We, we hooked up.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.524
- No,

08:12.526 --> 08:13.725
girl.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.726
He's a dog.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.329
You're smarter than that.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.630
- I don't know, he was just,

08:18.632 --> 08:22.334
actually sweet and I
don't know, just fun.

08:23.871 --> 08:24.769
- I mean.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.340
- Hey, guys, wait up.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.575
(sighing)

08:32.746 --> 08:34.111
- [Steffen] The 30?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.147
- [Rosie] Stop dude, crazy.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.649
- [Doc] You guys
talking about football?

08:37.650 --> 08:39.618
- Oh yeah, I was telling
Rosie about this building

08:39.620 --> 08:41.152
my dad just bought.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.020
He's trying to turn
it into condos.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.624
But I got a surprise
for you guys.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.026
- Oh man, how is your dad doing?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.494
- He's all right.

08:51.765 --> 08:52.664
Guys come here.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.067
- [Rosie] This better be good.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.369
- Oh don't fucking worry.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.175
- So what's the big surprise?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.043
- The building.

09:07.147 --> 09:07.979
- It's big.

09:07.981 --> 09:08.880
- I don't get it.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.616
- My dad wants to make
this place into condos

09:11.618 --> 09:13.151
or some bullshit.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.886
I think I can talk him into

09:14.888 --> 09:17.422
letting us open an
after hours club.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.890
- In this area?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.359
- Fuckin' A dog, do you
have to question everything?

09:22.629 --> 09:23.895
- I'm out here all the time.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.130
- See?

09:25.132 --> 09:27.632
- Stef, it's a
real piece of shit.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.235
- Hey, I got some
champagne on ice.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.104
Let me show you guys
inside, change your minds.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.573
- No one fucks with
champagne.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.708
- [Josie] Shit! (groaning)

09:36.710 --> 09:37.709
- What happened?
- I don't know,

09:37.711 --> 09:39.544
I broke my ankle or something.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.478
Oh, shit.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.279
- Hey,
- Come on.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.213
Rick, no I got her.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.481
- [Rick] No, are you sure?

09:43.483 --> 09:44.282
- [Doc] Don't you
have somebody else

09:44.284 --> 09:44.983
you need to be watching?

09:44.985 --> 09:46.084
- [Josie] Guys.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.787
(door rattling)

09:48.789 --> 09:50.956
- [Abby] You're so scary.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.993
- [Steffen] Come on in.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.763
(Abby giggling)
- [Abby] It's creepy in here.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.198
Steffen hit the lights.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.400
- [] All right, all
right, I'll look for them.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.970
Doc, watch that door.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.077
- [Rosie] Watch out.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.778
- [Abby] You're such
a gentleman, thanks.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.514
(intense music)

10:21.688 --> 10:24.389
(rattling)

10:24.391 --> 10:25.557
- What was that sound?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.760
- Probably rats.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.894
- [Rick] Rats?

10:29.896 --> 10:31.596
(shrieking)

10:31.598 --> 10:33.465
- That was right in my ear.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.166
- [Abby] Something
ran over my foot.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.935
What?
- Oh, I think I got it.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.203
Let's go.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.605
- It's not funny, it's gross.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.340
- [Rick] Come on, let's
go check this thing out.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.643
(laughing)

10:48.382 --> 10:51.916
- [Abby] It's not funny,
you guys, it's gross.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.185
- It's okay Abby, it
was probably nothing.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.321
Just stick with me,

10:57.658 --> 10:58.657
I'll protect you.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.624
- Yeah?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.860
With your big shaft of wood?

11:03.230 --> 11:04.963
- He still has them huh?

11:04.965 --> 11:08.700
- Yeah, my dad's girlfriends.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.269
You know my mom says that
he sticks his wrench in them

11:11.271 --> 11:13.104
more than he does her.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.706
- She really says that?

11:14.708 --> 11:17.542
- Yeah, she can be pretty gross.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.144
- Remember when he brought
his first one home?

11:19.146 --> 11:20.779
Remember how cool
we thought it was?

11:20.781 --> 11:22.881
- Dude, there's no signal here.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.650
(tense music)

11:25.652 --> 11:28.853
- Hey why don't you
guys look around, okay?

11:29.656 --> 11:30.889
Pour some drinks

11:30.891 --> 11:33.391
and then I'll tell you
what I've been thinking.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.126
Rick you wanna help me pour?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.261
- Sure man.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.630
- Hey, what's all this?

11:38.632 --> 11:41.499
- Oh it's probably
just old TV stuff

11:41.501 --> 11:44.736
from that kids show that
shot here in the 60's.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.272
(tense music)

11:49.943 --> 11:51.443
- What's up with you and Doc?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.247
- We hooked up a few weeks ago

11:56.249 --> 11:58.216
and now I guess she's mad at me.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.151
- Doc hooked up with you?

12:00.153 --> 12:00.952
- [Rick] Hey.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.220
- Well you're a dog man.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.922
Anybody who knows you
knows you're a dog.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.323
Why would she play with that?

12:05.325 --> 12:08.259
- Beats me, I mean,
I was surprised too.

12:08.261 --> 12:12.297
We ran into each other at
a bar and had some fun.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.566
She invited me home, I went

12:16.002 --> 12:17.669
and we did the deed.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.637
The next day she
starts texting me and

12:21.408 --> 12:22.741
I ghosted her.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.175
- You ghosted Doc?

12:24.177 --> 12:26.778
- Yeah, I feel a
little bad about that.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.848
- That's like fucking
your sister man.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.449
- Not as cool as you may think.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.618
- Jesus Rick.
- Whatever.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.054
- Wait, wait,

12:36.056 --> 12:39.758
is this your first time
seeing her since that night?

12:39.760 --> 12:40.692
- Yeah, could be.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.965
- Did she know you were
bringing a date with you?

12:48.368 --> 12:49.334
- (quietly) Fuck.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.436
- You suck, you truly suck man.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.704
Make this up to her, tonight.

12:52.706 --> 12:55.340
- It might not be as
easy as you think bro.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.875
I think she's got
a thing for me.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.709
- A thing?

12:57.711 --> 12:59.577
- Yes, a thing.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.979
Hey, she always
had a thing for me

13:00.981 --> 13:03.548
and I just never noticed before.

13:03.550 --> 13:07.485
- Hey, listen, we've known
each other since grade school.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.721
I want her to be a
part of this project.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.023
Make this up to her, tonight.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.224
- Not my fault she
doesn't understand

13:13.226 --> 13:14.325
the rules of engagement.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.094
- Listen, shit head, just do it.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.495
- Sure, whatever.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.566
Hey.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.867
- Hey.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.636
- What you got there?

13:24.638 --> 13:27.539
- Look, I found this puppet.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.507
And he looks brand new.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.843
- Yeah, it does look new.

13:32.846 --> 13:33.745
Weird.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.081
- Here take my phone, I
wanna snap some photos.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.452
(tapping)

13:41.454 --> 13:42.554
- [Rick] Turn around.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.257
- Is that cute?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.091
(kissing)

13:47.093 --> 13:48.626
Do some dirty ones.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.727
(Rick laughing)

13:49.729 --> 13:50.695
You mean video?

13:50.697 --> 13:53.531
- Okay, okay, enough, enough.

13:54.568 --> 13:55.700
- Hey aren't these
things supposed to have

13:55.702 --> 13:57.602
like a little
drawstring on the back?

13:57.604 --> 14:01.072
Or a place you could put your
hand up their little butt?

14:03.243 --> 14:04.676
- Who's this guy supposed to be?

14:04.678 --> 14:07.612
(mimicking puppet) Hey,
might get me fucking haircut.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.080
(laughing)

14:09.082 --> 14:12.183
- He's like a 50's guy,
like the Fonz or something.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.786
- Who?

14:14.788 --> 14:16.521
- [Rosie] Shit look, he's
got two biddies with him too.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.223
- Hey, maybe those
two are a couple

14:18.225 --> 14:20.058
and the Fonz is
their best friend.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.392
Like you and me Rose.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.527
(laughing)
- Yeah.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.428
- [Josie] Hey,

14:24.564 --> 14:26.030
look,

14:26.032 --> 14:27.632
it's a little cowboy.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.068
- My God, it's the
village people.

14:30.070 --> 14:30.902
(laughing)

14:30.904 --> 14:31.870
- [Abby] Hey, who?

14:33.473 --> 14:36.341
- I think these puppets
are probably just leftovers

14:36.343 --> 14:39.244
from that kids TV show that
shot here during the 60's.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.113
I think it was,

14:43.483 --> 14:47.518
oh no, it was Mr. Jolly
and the Handy Dandy Show.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.788
- They named a kids
show after a hand job?

14:50.790 --> 14:51.789
(laughing)

14:51.791 --> 14:53.358
No way.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.859
- Grow up Rick.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.294
- It didn't mean that back then.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.796
That Handy Dandy puppet's
probably around here somewhere.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.365
He was like the star puppet.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.866
- How do you know all this shit?

15:01.868 --> 15:06.037
- My grandfather knew a
producer or something.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.238
- So after all these years,

15:07.240 --> 15:08.806
dad ends up buying
the place huh?

15:08.808 --> 15:11.309
- Yeah, must've had
an affect on him,

15:11.311 --> 15:13.444
you know, the formative years.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.679
Kind of hoping for one of those

15:14.681 --> 15:16.581
all-in-the-family
type of things.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.482
- [Doc] Karma.

15:21.821 --> 15:26.124
- Oh Abby, I think you have
that Handy Dandy puppet.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.327
You know my dad used
to watch shows live

15:29.329 --> 15:30.662
on this very stage.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.065
- Wasn't there some sick
shit that happened here?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.400
I think I remember
reading about it online

15:35.402 --> 15:37.068
on some click bait site.

15:38.571 --> 15:42.840
- Yeah, that Mr. Jolly
guy hung himself.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.009
- A kids TV show host
hung himself here?

15:45.011 --> 15:45.910
- Mm-hmm.

15:46.880 --> 15:47.779
- Where?

15:49.382 --> 15:50.281
Here?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.318
- That's some sick shit.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.619
- Bad karma.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.820
- Oh, no, no, fuck that.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.523
That was like 50 years ago.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.892
All good vibes now, okay?

16:01.995 --> 16:05.029
Listen, my dad bought
this place for a reason

16:05.031 --> 16:07.065
and it's my job to
make it awesome.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.636
Put those things down, they're
probably filthy though.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.537
- Ew.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.974
- [Josie] No, they look great.

16:17.544 --> 16:22.113
- Guys, look around
at this space, okay?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.984
With a little hard
work and imagination

16:25.986 --> 16:29.687
I think we could make this
into something very special.

16:29.689 --> 16:33.458
Now think about it,
we'd have drinks,

16:33.460 --> 16:36.694
dancing, live music.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.330
I mean with all this space,

16:39.332 --> 16:41.332
we could have a
recording studio in back

16:41.334 --> 16:43.101
and scout new bands.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.106
Up there, there's
a control room.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.242
Monitors every inch
of this building.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.978
(intense music)

17:18.038 --> 17:19.704
- There's a lot of
clubs in town already.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.040
- Right, but very
few after hours.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.942
And even fewer for
people our age.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.211
- Now let me guess,
you want my money?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.613
- Of course Rick.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.748
But I'll throw a
pile of cash too man.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.682
- Look man, I don't have money

17:31.684 --> 17:33.151
to be investing in no nightclub.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.420
- But chances are you're
gonna make it to the league,

17:35.422 --> 17:36.421
right Rosie?

17:36.423 --> 17:37.922
- I expect so.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.625
- Okay, so once you are, you
bring your teammates in here,

17:40.627 --> 17:42.894
people find out that players
are hanging out here,

17:42.896 --> 17:44.829
the place will be
fucking packed.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.364
We'll have to charge
a membership fee

17:46.366 --> 17:48.066
just to keep it exclusive.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.535
- What about me?

17:50.537 --> 17:53.337
I know I just met you guys,
but can I get in on this?

17:53.339 --> 17:55.106
- I have been
thinking about that.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.709
What do your friends do?

17:58.711 --> 17:59.944
- My friends?

17:59.946 --> 18:02.947
- Yeah, like, what
do they do for work?

18:02.949 --> 18:05.550
- Oh, well they're
models mainly.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.784
- Excellent.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.386
(laughing)

18:08.388 --> 18:10.888
So like if you make
sure a certain amount

18:10.890 --> 18:12.957
of your model
friends were in here,

18:12.959 --> 18:16.527
I'm sure we could get you a
percentage of the door monthly.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.597
- Well would they have
to do anything kinky?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.766
- Only if they were
in the kinky mood.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.504
- Yeah, no thanks.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.371
- What?

18:29.742 --> 18:33.811
- Listen, I love you guys
and all but you know me,

18:33.813 --> 18:35.279
I have no interest
in a straight club

18:35.281 --> 18:37.014
with jocks and models.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.183
- Yeah, yeah, I get that.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.651
I respect it.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.453
- But thanks for asking,
it was really sweet of you.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.722
- Mm-hmm, sure.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.556
(gasping)

18:45.558 --> 18:48.726
(intense music)

18:48.728 --> 18:49.727
- What the hell?

18:51.030 --> 18:55.366
- Fuck, we just got the
electricity checked this week.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.834
- [Rosie] Check
it again brother.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.770
- There we go.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.106
- Okay, this place
is creepy as fuck.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.374
Let's just get out of here.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.942
- Oh, hold on a
couple of minutes.

19:04.944 --> 19:08.012
I wanna show you guys
the offices, okay?

19:08.014 --> 19:10.281
I mean, Josie, I
know you're out,

19:10.283 --> 19:12.383
but the rest of you
are still in, right?

19:12.385 --> 19:14.752
- Dude, you're like the
luckiest guy in the world.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.421
Completely ridiculous shit that
should blow up in your face

19:17.423 --> 19:19.857
always seems to work
out great for you,

19:19.859 --> 19:21.826
so yeah, I'm definitely in.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.029
- Yeah, you're one lucky
fuck, that's for sure.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.364
- I'm in bro.

19:26.366 --> 19:30.535
- All right, this is
gonna be fucking epic.

19:30.537 --> 19:34.405
All right, let me
show you your office.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.440
- Let me see that bottle.

19:36.442 --> 19:39.010
(Abby giggling)

19:39.012 --> 19:41.579
(tense music)

19:55.828 --> 19:58.129
You don't care about
any old offices, do you?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.367
- No.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.636
- Let's go do some
exploring of our own.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.537
- [Abby] Okay.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.548
- So, what do you guys think?

20:18.851 --> 20:20.484
- Other than it's
straight out of the 80's?

20:20.486 --> 20:22.053
- Oh.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.654
- No, I mean, it's
got potential.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.488
I mean, it does.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.723
- I know, right?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.491
No, I think we can make
something really cool

20:27.493 --> 20:28.426
out of this place.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.695
- Hey, where's Rick and Abby?

20:31.531 --> 20:34.098
(tense music)

20:35.802 --> 20:38.236
- Now this is what I call kinky.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.538
- A little too kinky.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.444
Let's keep going.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.411
(giggling)

20:47.413 --> 20:48.279
- Okay.

20:50.516 --> 20:51.582
- Nope, come here, come here.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.550
I think I see something.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.485
- If you like this building,

20:54.487 --> 20:57.121
you're gonna love my dad's boat.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.056
- [Abby] Any excuse
to be in a bikini.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.359
- [Rick] Hey.

21:02.895 --> 21:03.728
- Get in this.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.564
(dramatic music)

21:08.635 --> 21:09.734
- Let's keep going,

21:09.736 --> 21:10.735
let's keep going.
- Okay.

21:11.537 --> 21:12.903
- Oh, what's in here?

21:15.475 --> 21:18.109
Oh yeah. (giggling)

21:19.312 --> 21:20.878
Oh, I can make this work.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.415
- Looks like Steffen's dad's

21:24.417 --> 21:26.317
already gotten
himself established.

21:28.554 --> 21:29.553
Nice.

21:29.555 --> 21:32.123
(tense music)

21:33.026 --> 21:35.059
Don't you look tasty.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.327
- Give you any ideas?

21:36.329 --> 21:37.662
- Oh, you give me lots of ideas.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.896
Why don't you come over here

21:38.898 --> 21:40.164
and let me show you
what I'm thinking?

21:45.538 --> 21:46.804
(shrieking and giggling)

21:46.806 --> 21:48.139
- [Abby] You're so strong.

21:50.677 --> 21:51.842
- I've got an idea.

21:51.844 --> 21:56.080
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

21:56.082 --> 21:56.947
Trust me.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.217
- [Abby] I've never
done this before.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.919
- [Rick] Yeah, right.

22:04.223 --> 22:05.823
- [Abby] Oh my goodness.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.857
(giggling)

22:06.859 --> 22:09.427
(tense music)

22:16.369 --> 22:17.601
- Rough night?

22:20.106 --> 22:21.839
- Just stupid night.

22:22.742 --> 22:23.874
Or I'm stupid.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.509
I'm probably stupid.

22:26.279 --> 22:27.178
- I doubt that.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.081
(electricity whirring)

22:30.083 --> 22:32.883
(dramatic music)

22:41.160 --> 22:46.063
- We are almost at a point
where they can do most anything.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.801
You see Mr. NFL over there?

22:50.803 --> 22:52.203
We've got prototypes in the lab

22:52.205 --> 22:54.572
that's going to make
the NLF obsolete.

22:55.842 --> 22:56.707
- [Josie] Weird.

22:58.077 --> 23:02.913
- In every way, everywhere,
humans are the problem.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.916
But robotics is gonna
change all of that.

23:05.918 --> 23:09.320
We're just taking it out
of the hands of the humans.

23:09.322 --> 23:10.187
- Wow,

23:11.557 --> 23:15.159
so, Skynet's going
to become self aware

23:15.161 --> 23:16.861
and start a nuclear holocaust

23:16.863 --> 23:19.230
and get rid of the pesky humans?

23:19.232 --> 23:23.601
- Okay, come on, that's a movie.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.036
- You are a scary little shit.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.406
You are.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.306
- Shut up.

23:30.343 --> 23:33.944
No but seriously though,
you have no idea.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.680
(intense music)

23:40.286 --> 23:43.287
- Hey, we could go
to that control room

23:43.289 --> 23:44.188
and look for Rick.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.022
We could use the-

23:45.024 --> 23:47.224
- Doc, just let it go.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.393
They'll show up at some point.

23:49.395 --> 23:51.228
- So Steph?
- Hmm?

23:51.230 --> 23:52.463
- You really think your dad's

23:52.465 --> 23:55.065
just gonna like give
you this building?

23:55.067 --> 23:56.600
(laughing)

23:56.602 --> 23:59.069
I mean, he's not the most
supportive guy in the world.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.039
- Body's a temple.

24:04.944 --> 24:09.046
- Nope, nope, so far
he's told me, "No,"

24:09.048 --> 24:11.048
"what do you know
about running a club?"

24:11.050 --> 24:14.752
And, "You got no idea what
you're getting yourself into

24:14.754 --> 24:15.786
"with this place."

24:15.788 --> 24:16.620
(Rosie snickering)

24:16.622 --> 24:17.455
- Sounds about right.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.489
Sounds pretty promising.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.658
- What changes his mind?

24:21.761 --> 24:24.328
My mom says it's not,

24:24.330 --> 24:27.364
it's not the club idea,

24:27.366 --> 24:28.966
it's like the building.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.903
- It's this building, the
one he just bought, okay.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.473
- Yeah, he hates it.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.277
(moaning)

24:40.279 --> 24:41.679
- What was that?

24:43.015 --> 24:44.615
I'm sure I heard something.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.650
Rick, get this
damn hat off of me.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.285
- Uh-huh.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.354
(dramatic music)

24:50.356 --> 24:53.057
- So dad grew up in
this neighborhood,

24:53.059 --> 24:54.758
like I was saying before.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.529
And he always used to come
to that kids TV show here.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.830
- The one that the
puppets were a part of?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.031
- [Steffen] Yeah.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.833
- Must've been a
really crappy show.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.971
- Actually, no, there
were some child killings

25:06.973 --> 25:08.439
in this neighborhood.

25:08.441 --> 25:11.208
One of my dad's best
friends went missing

25:11.210 --> 25:13.410
and was never found.

25:13.412 --> 25:16.247
Yeah, my dad was the
last person to see him.

25:16.249 --> 25:17.715
He told people for awhile

25:17.717 --> 25:20.284
that the puppets
from that TV show

25:20.286 --> 25:22.386
were the ones that
killed his friend.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.521
- Killer puppets?

25:24.323 --> 25:25.756
That's a wild story man.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.024
- No kidding.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.560
- Yeah, it sounds like
your dad saw something

25:29.562 --> 25:31.929
and just turned it
into something else.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.397
- Probably.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.666
My mom says those puppets
come from the Masonic temple,

25:35.668 --> 25:37.468
some archival vault.

25:37.470 --> 25:39.970
Before that, no
one really knows.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.540
- You know my mom volunteers
at the theater over there.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.342
She does say, in those archives,
is some pretty dark shit.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.511
- Yeah, like dark magic.

25:47.513 --> 25:49.513
- Yeah, masons are weird.

25:49.515 --> 25:54.251
My dad once spent years looking
for some Masonic artifact.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.187
Yeah, found out about
that one from mom

25:57.189 --> 25:59.323
when just out of the
blue, for two months,

25:59.325 --> 26:02.993
he was gone in
someplace called Kandar.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.194
- Kandar?

26:04.196 --> 26:05.629
What the hell is that?

26:05.631 --> 26:07.364
- Wait, is that a city?

26:07.366 --> 26:09.767
- No, it's not a city.

26:09.769 --> 26:13.537
My mom said it's like a
European ruins, or a castle.

26:13.539 --> 26:15.372
- Okay, okay, so what the hell

26:15.374 --> 26:17.841
he need some Masonic
artifact for?

26:17.843 --> 26:19.944
- I don't know man.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.646
To amplify something
of something.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.448
I really don't know.

26:24.450 --> 26:27.251
- How does your mom
know all of this?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.819
- My dad's a mason.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.888
Pretty high up actually.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.824
- Okay, what does he say?

26:33.826 --> 26:35.593
- He says nothing.

26:35.595 --> 26:36.994
(screaming)

26:36.996 --> 26:38.228
- There!

26:38.230 --> 26:39.930
That was not here
when we came in.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.066
- You're just high.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.101
- Josie, did you see that
puppet when we came in here?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.470
- No, I absolutely did not.

26:46.472 --> 26:49.306
(dramatic music)

26:53.579 --> 26:56.614
(laughing)

26:56.616 --> 26:57.848
- [Rick] Yeah.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.555
(gasping)

27:07.226 --> 27:10.027
(dramatic music)

27:11.030 --> 27:12.596
- Hey baby.

27:12.598 --> 27:16.166
(screaming and shrieking)

27:17.536 --> 27:21.071
Okay boys, let's get this
kinky bitch outta here.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.907
(dramatic music)

27:26.245 --> 27:29.213
(Abby crying out)

27:37.490 --> 27:39.990
- Must be some old
commercial for the show.

27:39.992 --> 27:40.824
(singing on TV)

27:40.826 --> 27:43.127
- Yeah, that make sense.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.663
- No, okay, that
does not make sense.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.365
Let's see, your
theory is that this TV

27:48.367 --> 27:52.136
just turned on by itself and
a commercial from 50 years ago

27:52.138 --> 27:53.537
just started playing?

27:53.539 --> 27:56.140
- Well, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

27:56.142 --> 28:00.044
- Well, no, that shouldn't
happen, for sure.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.345
- Okay, but what's your theory?

28:01.347 --> 28:03.480
- I don't have one,
that's my point.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.883
- She doesn't have
a theory numb nuts.

28:05.885 --> 28:09.053
That shouldn't
happen, ever, period.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.256
(yelling on TV)

28:12.258 --> 28:15.092
(dramatic music)

28:16.295 --> 28:19.196
(muffled gasping)

28:23.903 --> 28:26.537
- I hate these fucking puppets.

28:26.539 --> 28:27.471
What are they?

28:27.473 --> 28:29.940
Nothing but wood and weird.

28:29.942 --> 28:30.841
- Hey, shhh.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.144
Did you guys hear something?

28:34.914 --> 28:35.813
- No.

28:36.916 --> 28:37.815
- [Doc] Maybe.

28:39.452 --> 28:40.684
- Now I'm hearing things.

28:40.686 --> 28:41.819
What do you say we
get out of here?

28:41.821 --> 28:42.753
- Yeah, I'm beat.

28:45.524 --> 28:46.890
- [Doc] Now what?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.926
- Yo Stef, this
building's got issue bro.

28:48.928 --> 28:52.229
(music playing on TV)
¶ It's the Handy Dandy Show. ¶

28:52.231 --> 28:55.199
¶ Handy Dandy show ¶

28:56.736 --> 29:00.704
- Hey, how is that TV
still on with no power?

29:00.706 --> 29:01.972
- Oh, I don't wanna know.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.273
- You saw it, you
just saw it move.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.274
- I ain't seen nothing.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.542
(music playing on TV)

29:05.544 --> 29:07.244
¶ That's why it's
the Handy Dandy ¶

29:07.246 --> 29:09.079
- Killer ghost puppets.
- Funny.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.749
Let's just get
out to the hallway

29:11.751 --> 29:13.283
and we'll figure
it out from there.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.318
- [Rosie] Yeah, then we'll
be able to see out there,

29:14.320 --> 29:15.819
sort of.

29:15.821 --> 29:16.920
- [Doc] Okay well it's clear
that something not so good

29:16.922 --> 29:18.188
is happening here.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.623
- Right, so let's
get the hell out.

29:19.625 --> 29:23.660
(music playing on TV)
¶ It's the Handy Dandy show ¶

29:23.662 --> 29:26.396
(intense music)

29:34.106 --> 29:36.073
- It looks like the
lights are on downstairs.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.407
- Okay, good, let's go that way.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.475
- Hey, hey, hey, slow down.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.910
Remember, the staircase turns.

29:39.912 --> 29:40.878
- [Rosie] Oh shit.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.148
No, I think someone
just touched me man.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.682
- Come on, we can just go.

29:45.684 --> 29:46.517
We're almost there.

29:46.519 --> 29:47.818
(Doc shrieking)

29:47.820 --> 29:49.052
- [Josie] Shit,
where are the lights?

29:49.054 --> 29:51.021
- [Rosie] Something
just grabbed my ankle.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.456
- [Josie] Oh stop.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.390
- [Steffen] What?

29:54.460 --> 29:57.528
- That looks like a trip wire.

29:57.530 --> 29:58.862
- What the fuck?

30:00.266 --> 30:02.800
- This pretty much proves it.
Somebody is in here with us.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.034
- [Rosie] This is so fucked.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.035
I mean, who the hell
could be in here man?

30:05.037 --> 30:06.436
- Can we even get to the door?

30:06.438 --> 30:09.173
What if this whole
place is booby trapped?

30:09.175 --> 30:11.141
- Who the hell would set
up a booby trap Stef?

30:11.143 --> 30:13.744
- Don't look at me, my dad
just bought this fucking place.

30:13.746 --> 30:16.380
It's not like I got
a special connection.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.781
Jesus Rosie.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.285
- Is everyone okay?

30:21.287 --> 30:23.554
Let's just get to the door.

30:23.556 --> 30:25.222
- All right, everyone, slowly.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.393
- Wait, wait, what
about Rick and Abby?

30:29.395 --> 30:30.861
- Fuck Rick and Abby.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.029
Let's just get out of here safe.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.230
We'll send someone for them.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.731
- Doc, Doc, please.

30:34.733 --> 30:37.301
- We can't just stand here
in a little bunch, okay?

30:37.303 --> 30:39.870
We're an easy target if
somebody's in here with us.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.173
- Listen man, this
is your hell hole,

30:43.175 --> 30:44.508
you just lead the way bro.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.912
- Okay fine and we gotta get
through my dad's cars, okay,

30:48.914 --> 30:50.214
to get to that door.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.983
Just don't fuck up
his cars, please.

30:54.587 --> 30:55.619
All right, let's go.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.021
- Doc,

30:58.023 --> 30:58.856
you coming?

31:00.359 --> 31:01.725
- [Steffen] Come on Doc.

31:01.727 --> 31:04.294
(tense music)

31:51.577 --> 31:54.811
- Mr. Jolly, as I
live and breathe.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.181
- For now.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.585
You bought the studio.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.954
It's a strange choice.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.491
Sentimental memories?

32:07.493 --> 32:10.060
(light music)

32:12.631 --> 32:14.164
- I spent my whole life
preparing to see you again.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.905
Now that I see you, I still
can't believe you're alive.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.442
Know that I have
come here defended.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.882
- Oh Richard, Richard.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.352
I'm a 200 year old dark magician

32:35.354 --> 32:37.287
with a family of killer puppets.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.324
I'm sure whatever
defense you brought,

32:40.326 --> 32:41.258
it's not enough.

32:44.763 --> 32:45.929
So you found the twin.

32:47.499 --> 32:51.868
Hmm, I suppose the jewel
is bonded to you hmm?

32:53.605 --> 32:54.471
That's a pity.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.674
I spent a long time
looking for this.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.778
But I found the bigger prize.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.580
- You found the
Kandarian artifact?

33:05.617 --> 33:06.683
It's real?

33:08.520 --> 33:09.953
In the ruins?

33:09.955 --> 33:13.623
- The traveler's power
resides safely with me.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.727
(mysterious music)

33:16.729 --> 33:17.694
- And the dagger?

33:22.868 --> 33:24.334
You didn't find it, did you?

33:26.005 --> 33:27.471
It wasn't with the artifact.

33:29.842 --> 33:34.778
And without it, the
artifact's power is useless.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.279
- Oh is that what your research

33:36.281 --> 33:38.348
at the local library told you?

33:38.350 --> 33:41.852
Boy, you're out of your depth.

33:43.188 --> 33:46.456
You trust me, when the time
comes, even without the dagger,

33:46.458 --> 33:49.226
the Kandarian artifact
will have power enough.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.797
- Did you ever consider
how you ended up here,

33:54.700 --> 33:55.599
in Detroit?

33:58.937 --> 34:02.472
I mean, you were in
Scotland, London,

34:02.474 --> 34:03.807
the Grand Lodge in New York.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.109
- Have you been putting
your little library card

34:06.111 --> 34:07.811
to good use?

34:07.813 --> 34:09.579
- Chicago until the fire.

34:13.185 --> 34:17.254
And it just so happens, the
world's largest Masonic lodge

34:17.255 --> 34:18.789
is three blocks from here.

34:20.826 --> 34:23.360
You were drawn here Jolly.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.329
(mysterious music)

34:28.199 --> 34:29.266
This ends tonight.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.538
You will not succeed and
you will not survive.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.540
- Really Richard?

34:36.542 --> 34:39.909
You must learn to
recognize your betters.

34:40.712 --> 34:43.647
- Yeah, okay, well cut me loose.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.215
Let's see who will win:

34:45.217 --> 34:46.983
the man, or the monster.

34:46.985 --> 34:50.320
- Smart money's always
on the monster, son.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.626
Do you know a person's
character is fully formed

34:56.628 --> 34:57.461
by the age of eight?

34:57.463 --> 34:58.295
Did you know that?

34:58.297 --> 34:59.196
The age of eight.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.600
How old were you when
your friend was attacked?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.502
How old were you when
you left him to die

35:05.504 --> 35:06.903
in a dark field?

35:06.905 --> 35:08.839
How old were you, coward,
when you ran away,

35:08.841 --> 35:11.374
ran away, ran away, ran away?

35:11.376 --> 35:13.210
- I was eight you fucker!

35:13.212 --> 35:15.512
- Watch your language.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.546
The children.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.585
I had a child who
was a coward once.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.187
I'd let him live.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.224
I regret that.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.926
- You killed so many children.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.063
My friends.

35:35.134 --> 35:36.833
I remember every name.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.568
- We did boy.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.504
Gossipy boy.

35:40.506 --> 35:44.441
Naughty boy with
your tattling tongue.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.943
So insistent with your
stories of killer puppets

35:46.945 --> 35:48.378
that people began to
take you seriously.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.180
It was quite annoying.

35:50.182 --> 35:52.048
- My pleasure.

35:52.050 --> 35:54.050
- You made me kill myself.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.086
I had to stage a muerte de scene

35:56.088 --> 35:58.555
to rid myself of the
authorities because of you.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.058
- But how?

36:03.428 --> 36:05.896
I talked to the cop who cut
you down from the catch rack.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.332
- Illusion, illusion.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.134
All

36:12.237 --> 36:13.303
is illusion.

36:13.305 --> 36:17.040
(mysterious music)

36:17.042 --> 36:20.477
My puppets and I have waited
50 years for this night

36:20.479 --> 36:22.045
to right the scales.

36:23.415 --> 36:26.116
So yes, you are right.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.887
Tonight is the night that
we end this, as you say.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.325
- So you're going to
use me as a sacrifice

36:35.327 --> 36:36.760
for your blood ritual?

36:38.030 --> 36:38.929
- No,

36:41.133 --> 36:42.532
I need you to watch.

36:45.871 --> 36:46.770
- Watch, why?

36:48.640 --> 36:49.539
- To hurt you.

36:51.176 --> 36:54.177
- You want me watch
you kill another child?

36:54.179 --> 36:58.515
- Not just another
child, your child.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.150
- Steffen?

37:00.152 --> 37:01.017
- He's here.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.188
- Don't you lay a hand
on him you motherfucker!

37:07.426 --> 37:09.793
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.095
Do what you want to me,

37:13.665 --> 37:15.131
but don't take his life.

37:18.503 --> 37:20.270
- It's already done.

37:20.272 --> 37:23.607
(tense music)

37:23.609 --> 37:25.075
- You killed Steffen?

37:27.012 --> 37:28.245
Steffen is dead?

37:29.448 --> 37:31.881
Answer me!

37:31.883 --> 37:34.317
(gasping)

37:34.319 --> 37:37.153
(dramatic music)

37:41.960 --> 37:45.028
(rodents squeaking)

37:48.100 --> 37:49.666
- [Doc] All right.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.102
Shoot, oh Jesus.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.739
- Hey Rosie, just
stay close man.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.208
- Yeah, I think the
door's over this way.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.512
- I mean, this is okay.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.316
My eyes are adjusting to it.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.618
I cannot wait to get home.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.420
This day has been fucked.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.555
- I think I found
it, I found the door.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.791
(banging)

38:16.194 --> 38:18.028
Somebody must have locked
it from the other side.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.562
Fuck!

38:19.564 --> 38:23.233
- Like I said, somebody is
definitely in here with us.

38:23.235 --> 38:25.402
- And they definitely
don't want us to leave.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.836
- Shit.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.705
What should we do?

38:28.707 --> 38:30.907
(Doc sobbing)

38:30.909 --> 38:32.375
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

38:32.377 --> 38:34.177
You don't have to figure
this out by yourself, okay?

38:34.179 --> 38:36.613
- Well I sure as shit
don't have a plan.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.915
- Well there's windows, can't
we just climb out of a window?

38:38.917 --> 38:42.018
- Steel roll down cages
Josie, it's fucking Detroit.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.320
- Are you fucking kidding me?

38:43.322 --> 38:45.822
- No, we got them
reinforced last week.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.324
- [Rosie] Shit.

38:47.326 --> 38:48.258
(shrieking)

38:48.260 --> 38:50.327
- What the hell is that?

38:51.430 --> 38:54.064
- Guys, that only
leaves up, huh?

38:55.200 --> 38:57.133
- Yeah, the roof, let's go.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.902
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.403
This is all wrong.

39:00.405 --> 39:02.605
You honestly think that
whoever's sealed the door

39:02.607 --> 39:05.375
and killed the lights just
forgot about the roof?

39:05.377 --> 39:06.309
Really?

39:06.311 --> 39:07.777
They just slipped their minds?

39:07.779 --> 39:09.279
- Yeah, maybe.

39:09.281 --> 39:12.282
- We are in trouble Stef,
real trouble, all right?

39:12.284 --> 39:15.352
So we need a plan, we need
a working plan, all right?

39:15.354 --> 39:16.853
So everyone just
shut the fuck up

39:16.855 --> 39:18.855
and let's figure
something out, okay?

39:18.857 --> 39:19.789
- Okay.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.991
(dramatic music)

39:21.993 --> 39:24.961
- First, we need weapons.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.797
(dramatic music)

39:30.435 --> 39:33.837
(gasping and shrieking)

39:38.677 --> 39:41.177
(rock music)

39:42.481 --> 39:45.382
(puppet laughing)

39:56.395 --> 39:59.362
- Ladies, don't you
look lovely tonight.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.065
- Ah Handy.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.700
- What's the matter sweetheart?

40:05.771 --> 40:07.637
You did real good work girls.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.706
She looks so much better.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.075
Not as pretty as
you two of course.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.979
(muffled yelling and sobbing)

40:21.019 --> 40:22.719
What's a matter girly?

40:22.721 --> 40:25.455
(intense music)

40:31.630 --> 40:34.297
(Abby sobbing)

40:38.003 --> 40:40.136
Oh that's just our Mr. Jolly.

40:40.138 --> 40:44.007
He likes to make the kids,
the young and the old,

40:44.009 --> 40:45.642
real real happy.

40:46.445 --> 40:49.012
Are you happy model?

40:49.014 --> 40:51.314
(muffled shrieking)

40:51.316 --> 40:53.917
Didn't I hear her say
she was a model before?

40:58.723 --> 41:00.190
(giggling)

41:00.192 --> 41:01.257
I don't see it.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.725
She could use some work.

41:05.263 --> 41:08.965
¶ Ya da da da da da da ¶

41:08.967 --> 41:10.533
¶ Ya da da da da ¶
(muffled screaming)

41:10.535 --> 41:13.336
(puppet laughing)

41:13.338 --> 41:15.939
¶ Ya da da da ¶

41:15.941 --> 41:19.309
(Abby moaning)

41:19.311 --> 41:22.846
¶ Da da da da ¶
(Abby screaming) ¶

41:22.848 --> 41:24.914
Look girls, she's so happy.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.516
She's so happy, she's crying.

41:27.552 --> 41:29.786
(sobbing)

41:30.589 --> 41:32.722
You're supposed to be happy.

41:32.724 --> 41:36.759
Smile for me, smile for
your little buddy Handy.

41:36.761 --> 41:38.795
Smile and I'll make it all stop.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.465
(gasping and sobbing)

41:42.467 --> 41:44.601
(clicking tongue)

41:44.603 --> 41:47.237
That was pretty shitty.

41:47.239 --> 41:48.972
Let's see if I can help.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.674
(intense music)

41:54.112 --> 41:55.845
(screaming)

41:55.847 --> 41:56.913
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

42:00.519 --> 42:03.253
Well, maybe I can do
better on the other side.

42:04.122 --> 42:06.055
(groaning)

42:06.057 --> 42:07.624
(muffled sobbing and yelling)

42:07.626 --> 42:10.727
You know, I'm only
doing this for you.

42:10.729 --> 42:13.196
You gotta look your
best for them pageants.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.199
How you gonna win
without a great smile?

42:16.201 --> 42:18.434
(sobbing)

42:21.673 --> 42:22.839
Done.

42:22.841 --> 42:26.476
(Abby sobbing and yelling)

42:27.612 --> 42:30.280
I think this calls
for some selfies.

42:30.282 --> 42:32.415
Say cheese.
- Cheese!

42:32.417 --> 42:34.083
- That goes for you too model.

42:34.953 --> 42:36.252
Cheese!

42:36.254 --> 42:38.588
(giggling)

42:39.558 --> 42:41.424
- Wow.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.760
- Eh, whatever.

42:43.762 --> 42:46.296
Sorry to bore you
girls, but some people

42:46.298 --> 42:50.199
will just never be happy,
no matter how hard you try.

42:50.201 --> 42:51.234
(muffled sobbing)

42:51.236 --> 42:53.937
(intense music)

42:57.542 --> 42:59.809
- Okay you're suggesting
that we're being attacked

42:59.811 --> 43:01.244
by kids' show puppets?

43:01.246 --> 43:03.680
- No, Josie, I'm not suggestions

43:03.682 --> 43:05.415
we're being attacked by puppets.

43:05.417 --> 43:08.284
I am suggesting that there
might be someone in here

43:08.286 --> 43:09.786
who's seriously fucking with us,

43:09.788 --> 43:11.187
who might control the puppets.

43:11.189 --> 43:12.255
- That's ridiculous okay?

43:12.257 --> 43:13.356
They are made of wood.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.158
There's no mechanisms
whatsoever.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.526
- Oh really Doc,
then what the fuck

43:16.528 --> 43:17.827
do you think is about to happen?

43:17.829 --> 43:19.195
- I don't know.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.697
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

43:20.699 --> 43:22.131
Does this car still run?

43:22.133 --> 43:24.634
Let's just use it
to ram the door.

43:24.636 --> 43:27.403
- It might, but my dad
will fucking kill me.

43:27.405 --> 43:29.372
- Are you kidding me right now?

43:29.374 --> 43:31.674
Stephan, look around
us, we are fucked.

43:31.676 --> 43:33.142
- Okay, you guys,
we go to the roof,

43:33.144 --> 43:35.378
we get a signal, we
call the cops, huh?

43:35.380 --> 43:36.679
- That is not going to work.

43:36.681 --> 43:38.147
- Why, what's your big idea Doc?

43:38.149 --> 43:40.016
- I say that we
find Rick and Abby

43:40.018 --> 43:41.884
and we increase our numbers.

43:41.886 --> 43:43.620
- Fuck, I feel like
a sitting duck here.

43:43.622 --> 43:44.988
Can we just fucking move?

43:44.990 --> 43:46.456
- [Rosie] Let's.
- You good with that Doc?

43:46.458 --> 43:48.358
- Yes, please.

43:48.360 --> 43:50.660
Shit, Josie, are you okay?

43:50.662 --> 43:53.630
(mysterious music)

45:33.565 --> 45:34.831
(laughing)

45:34.833 --> 45:37.333
(rock music)

45:41.473 --> 45:43.806
(laughing)

45:55.720 --> 45:58.521
(dramatic music)

46:40.665 --> 46:41.831
- There they are, see?

46:41.833 --> 46:42.765
I told you.

46:42.767 --> 46:44.433
- Hey, hey, where are you going?

46:44.435 --> 46:45.935
- I'm going to get Rick.

46:45.937 --> 46:48.137
- You have no idea what's down
there. Could be a huge trap.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.372
- Let me go Josie.

46:49.374 --> 46:51.474
- Doc, the basement's
a goddamn dead end.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.509
- You do not know that it's
any more dangerous down there

46:53.511 --> 46:54.744
than it is right here.

46:54.746 --> 46:56.779
- No, we need to do what
Rosie and I just said.

46:56.781 --> 46:58.447
- I think our best
bet is the cars.

46:58.449 --> 46:59.949
- Plowing through the
wall is not gonna work.

46:59.951 --> 47:01.684
- No, we gotta go
to the fucking roof.

47:01.686 --> 47:02.885
- I'm done talking about this.

47:02.887 --> 47:04.887
I am going downstairs.

47:04.889 --> 47:06.155
Anybody coming with me?

47:06.157 --> 47:07.690
- It's so stupid to
split up right now.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.660
- I'll yell if I need help.

47:10.662 --> 47:12.595
- No one's gonna fucking
hear you, it's so huge.

47:12.597 --> 47:13.830
- Yeah.

47:13.832 --> 47:15.498
- Well then I guess
that's my problem.

47:19.204 --> 47:20.970
- I'm going to the cars.

47:20.972 --> 47:22.371
- Fucking idiots.

47:22.373 --> 47:25.374
(mysterious music)

47:28.246 --> 47:29.145
- Shit.

47:31.783 --> 47:32.682
You guys?

47:34.652 --> 47:36.686
Of course there's
more to this building

47:37.856 --> 47:39.121
Hey you guys?

47:42.861 --> 47:45.261
Hey you guys, I think
we're ready to go.

47:45.263 --> 47:47.730
(dark music)

47:49.400 --> 47:50.900
Hey, Rick?

47:53.304 --> 47:54.203
Abby?

47:55.139 --> 47:57.974
(dramatic music)

47:59.043 --> 47:59.942
Abby?

48:03.648 --> 48:05.114
This isn't funny.

48:09.153 --> 48:10.486
Guys it's Doc.

48:12.156 --> 48:14.123
If you hear me, say something.

48:14.125 --> 48:16.926
(dramatic music)

48:20.164 --> 48:21.063
Rick?

48:21.866 --> 48:22.765
Abby?

48:26.404 --> 48:27.370
Goddamn it.

48:29.874 --> 48:30.873
You guys down here?

48:33.444 --> 48:35.912
(rock music)

48:37.515 --> 48:38.481
We're ready to go.

48:41.819 --> 48:42.718
Shit!

48:46.057 --> 48:47.623
- Shit, so where to now?

48:49.027 --> 48:50.026
- I don't know man.

48:51.095 --> 48:53.729
I think there's like a stairway,

48:53.731 --> 48:55.231
might be a door on
the left or something.

48:55.233 --> 48:57.366
- What you do mean, you think?

48:57.368 --> 48:59.235
- My dad just bought the
fucking place, all right?

48:59.237 --> 49:02.238
If it's not on the left,
it'll be up on the right.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.205
- Mm-hmm.

49:03.207 --> 49:04.240
Yeah, this goes up.

49:08.513 --> 49:11.981
All right y'all,
we coming this way.

49:11.983 --> 49:16.585
We got big long wrenches, we
gonna smash your ass to pieces.

49:16.587 --> 49:17.787
- What the fuck are
you doing Rosie?

49:17.789 --> 49:19.555
- I'm scaring them away.

49:19.557 --> 49:20.790
- Good idea.

49:20.792 --> 49:22.358
- Well it's better
than your idea.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.393
"I think the exit's
on the left."

49:24.395 --> 49:25.394
Please.

49:25.396 --> 49:26.295
- Fuck you man.

49:27.765 --> 49:29.065
Shh, hear that?

49:30.101 --> 49:31.667
(mysterious music)

49:31.669 --> 49:32.935
- Stop it, man.

49:32.937 --> 49:35.304
- Let's get the fuck outta here.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.807
(rock music)

49:55.893 --> 49:56.792
- Shit,

49:57.628 --> 49:59.128
come on.

49:59.130 --> 50:00.029
Come on!

50:00.898 --> 50:03.265
(intense music)

50:03.267 --> 50:05.167
- Ain't gonna start honey.

50:05.169 --> 50:08.104
- I'm not having a conversation
with a fucking puppet.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.241
- Oh you'll keep talking
to this fucking puppet.

50:12.243 --> 50:13.476
- Yeah well if the guy
that's controlling you

50:13.478 --> 50:15.644
wants to come out and
face me like a man.

50:18.416 --> 50:19.949
(gasping)

50:19.951 --> 50:21.784
- Nobody controls me bitch.

50:21.786 --> 50:24.620
(dramatic music)

50:28.693 --> 50:32.495
(Doc whimpering and gasping)

50:33.398 --> 50:35.164
- Rick.

50:35.166 --> 50:37.633
(whimpering)

50:40.838 --> 50:41.670
Rick.

50:41.672 --> 50:43.839
(sobbing)

50:43.841 --> 50:46.409
Oh my God.

50:46.411 --> 50:47.643
(sad music)

50:47.645 --> 50:49.245
Rick,

50:49.247 --> 50:50.112
oh my God.

50:52.750 --> 50:54.483
We're in trouble.

50:54.485 --> 50:57.186
(crying loudly)

51:01.492 --> 51:03.959
(whimpering)

51:08.199 --> 51:11.033
(dramatic music)

51:12.603 --> 51:14.136
- Hey, what's up Doc?

51:15.039 --> 51:17.440
(screaming)

51:19.043 --> 51:22.445
- Boy she sure has a
set of lungs on her.

51:22.447 --> 51:25.314
Almost as loud as her boyfriend.

51:25.316 --> 51:26.782
- Boyfriend?

51:26.784 --> 51:29.318
What about that blonde we found
him boffing in the basement?

51:30.388 --> 51:33.255
Oh my eyes, my
eyes, I can't see!

51:33.257 --> 51:35.925
Oh, what have you done
to me you crazy bitch?

51:35.927 --> 51:38.894
Ow, it burns, it burns,
it burns, it it burns.

51:42.166 --> 51:44.400
(laughing)

51:44.402 --> 51:45.801
That's the funniest
fucking thing

51:45.803 --> 51:47.670
anyone's tried on me in years.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.672
I'm made of wood
you stupid bitch.

51:49.674 --> 51:51.107
I thought you were
the smart one.

51:51.109 --> 51:52.975
That's why I sent for you.

51:52.977 --> 51:55.778
(dramatic music)

51:58.883 --> 52:00.649
- Spray her.

52:02.153 --> 52:05.087
(Doc screaming)

52:05.089 --> 52:06.388
- Go tie her up.

52:09.560 --> 52:10.926
- Oh man, see?

52:12.830 --> 52:14.830
Right where I told ya.

52:14.832 --> 52:17.299
- Yeah, let's hope the
roof ain't locked though.

52:17.301 --> 52:18.801
- I think we're
gonna make it Rosie.

52:18.803 --> 52:20.035
- Yeah, I hope so.

52:22.773 --> 52:24.673
Yo, I can see the door.

52:26.010 --> 52:27.209
- Let's go for it.

52:27.211 --> 52:28.811
- Let's get the fuck outta here.

52:28.813 --> 52:31.647
(dramatic music)

52:35.586 --> 52:36.485
- Rosie?

52:37.588 --> 52:38.521
Rosie!

52:38.523 --> 52:40.623
Rosie, Rosie, can you hear me?

52:40.625 --> 52:41.524
Shit.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.527
Rosie, shit.

52:44.529 --> 52:47.329
Rosie, Rosie, oh shit, shit.

52:49.634 --> 52:51.433
Oh this is not good.

52:51.435 --> 52:54.136
(gasping)

52:54.138 --> 52:56.472
- There's a lot of you
little fuckers, aren't there?

53:00.311 --> 53:01.944
- So what's your
plan here Josie?

53:01.946 --> 53:03.445
You gonna come at me?

53:03.447 --> 53:06.115
Beat me into saw dust
with that wrench?

53:06.117 --> 53:09.218
You gonna do all of
that before my man here

53:09.220 --> 53:11.053
chops up your one good leg?

53:11.055 --> 53:12.855
- Who the fuck's
running this show?

53:14.325 --> 53:15.558
What do you want?

53:15.560 --> 53:17.126
- It's all part
of the game babe.

53:17.128 --> 53:19.361
You gotta do what the man wants.

53:19.363 --> 53:22.231
We've been waiting a
long time for this night.

53:22.233 --> 53:24.200
- When's your puppet
master gonna show himself?

53:24.202 --> 53:26.835
- Listen bitch, I
already told you,

53:26.837 --> 53:28.370
I got no master.

53:28.372 --> 53:29.538
I work for the man.

53:30.675 --> 53:33.542
He don't control me, I
have free puppet will.

53:33.544 --> 53:35.377
You see any strings on me?

53:35.379 --> 53:38.013
Anybody in the shadows
got their hand up my ass?

53:38.015 --> 53:38.847
No.

53:38.849 --> 53:39.915
- Did I hit a nerve?

53:41.319 --> 53:43.752
You just got someone fisting
your ass all day, don't ya?

53:43.754 --> 53:46.055
You're just somebody's
little bitch.

53:46.057 --> 53:47.056
- Fuck you.

53:50.094 --> 53:51.360
- Yippee ki yay what?

53:51.362 --> 53:53.662
Looks like we got
ourselves a big one.

53:53.664 --> 53:56.465
(dramatic music)

53:59.604 --> 54:00.769
(engine revving)

54:00.771 --> 54:03.706
(wheels squealing)

54:07.545 --> 54:09.845
- Start you little bastard.

54:12.183 --> 54:14.984
There's no reason for this.

54:14.986 --> 54:17.820
(dramatic music)

54:24.929 --> 54:27.930
(mysterious music)

54:33.137 --> 54:34.403
- [Mr. Jolly] It
won't work here.

54:34.405 --> 54:35.304
- Shit.

54:37.275 --> 54:38.307
- Your device,

54:39.977 --> 54:41.076
it won't work here.

54:41.078 --> 54:42.945
- What's with the mask?

54:44.315 --> 54:47.016
Are you the one who's been
doing this shit to us tonight?

54:49.086 --> 54:52.321
- I suppose you could
say I'm your host.

54:55.660 --> 54:57.860
- My father owns this building,

54:57.862 --> 55:02.231
so I guess you could say
you're my trespasser.

55:03.267 --> 55:04.266
- Dear boy,

55:05.970 --> 55:07.169
after all I've done

55:07.171 --> 55:11.507
to make your evening
entertaining and jolly.

55:11.509 --> 55:14.476
(mysterious music)

55:15.579 --> 55:17.579
- Don't tell me
you're Mr. Jolly?

55:18.416 --> 55:19.648
- At your service.

55:20.551 --> 55:21.650
- You're dead.

55:22.620 --> 55:24.186
- Life is but energy.

55:26.190 --> 55:28.691
Control energy, control life.

55:29.927 --> 55:33.295
- Listen, I don't care
who you think you are.

55:33.297 --> 55:35.631
If you're the one who's been
pulling this shit tonight,

55:35.633 --> 55:37.533
you're fucked in the head man.

55:37.535 --> 55:39.134
You think this is
funny or something?

55:39.136 --> 55:43.305
My friends are freaked out
beyond belief you old fuck.

55:43.307 --> 55:46.742
My one friend just broke
his goddamn leg in the steps

55:46.744 --> 55:48.844
because of the bullshit
you're pulling.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.512
- My puppets love to play.

55:51.682 --> 55:53.916
Look, beautiful.

55:56.153 --> 55:57.152
Blood moon.

55:59.156 --> 56:00.456
Super they say.

56:03.527 --> 56:04.760
An exhilarating view.

56:09.734 --> 56:13.135
You can almost see
the temple from here.

56:14.138 --> 56:15.137
- You're a mason?

56:16.974 --> 56:19.308
- Everything means
something to a mason.

56:20.144 --> 56:22.845
- You, here tonight,

56:24.715 --> 56:26.315
that means something.

56:26.317 --> 56:29.385
- Buddy, I don't have
time to chat, okay?

56:29.387 --> 56:32.254
My friend is in trouble and
you seem to have caused it.

56:32.256 --> 56:33.922
I need to go give him some help.

56:35.025 --> 56:36.959
- Where are your other friends?

56:36.961 --> 56:39.962
(mysterious music)

56:40.731 --> 56:42.030
- What?

56:42.032 --> 56:42.898
I don't know.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.200
- That's not good.

56:48.973 --> 56:51.740
A man should know
where his friends are.

56:53.911 --> 56:55.477
Bad things could happen.

56:55.479 --> 56:58.280
(dramatic music)

57:02.620 --> 57:04.219
(electricity buzzing)

57:04.221 --> 57:05.154
Good boy.

57:05.156 --> 57:06.722
- Get the fuck off me clown.

57:08.058 --> 57:11.160
You and those fucking puppets
have gotten us into this.

57:11.162 --> 57:14.229
You're gonna help me get
my friend downstairs,

57:14.231 --> 57:17.499
unlock that fucking door so I
can take him to the hospital.

57:17.501 --> 57:18.901
Do you understand?

57:18.903 --> 57:21.870
- Masons are magicians,
did you know that?

57:22.740 --> 57:23.639
- Bullshit.

57:24.875 --> 57:27.309
My dad's a mason,
he's no magician.

57:28.379 --> 57:29.845
- He's quite rich isn't he?

57:30.815 --> 57:32.481
- Yeah, so what?

57:33.751 --> 57:35.250
He worked hard.

57:35.252 --> 57:38.587
- Greed, it's a nasty vice.

57:39.690 --> 57:41.757
Quite common among
dark magicians.

57:43.294 --> 57:44.193
Me,

57:45.696 --> 57:47.095
I'm greedy for life,

57:48.632 --> 57:49.531
yours.

57:51.902 --> 57:53.235
- Are you threatening me?

57:58.776 --> 58:00.609
- You're braver
than your father.

58:00.611 --> 58:02.511
(intense music)

58:02.513 --> 58:05.948
(electricity buzzing)

58:05.950 --> 58:07.516
- What are you?

58:07.518 --> 58:10.252
(intense music)

58:20.130 --> 58:21.396
- Control energy,

58:22.900 --> 58:24.266
control life.

58:26.537 --> 58:27.436
Children,

58:28.506 --> 58:29.404
come.

58:31.008 --> 58:32.107
Bring the boy.

58:36.547 --> 58:37.646
It's showtime.

58:37.648 --> 58:40.382
(intense music)

58:41.485 --> 58:45.120
Hello sugar, do we
know what day it is?

58:45.122 --> 58:50.192
That's right, it's the Handy
Dandy day show, here we go.

58:50.728 --> 58:53.061
(upbeat music)

58:53.063 --> 58:56.798
¶ It's the Handy Dandy show ¶

58:58.035 --> 58:58.901
- Stef?

59:00.037 --> 59:01.236
Stef, you alive man?

59:02.306 --> 59:04.640
(groaning)

59:05.976 --> 59:07.709
Wake the fuck up man.

59:07.711 --> 59:09.678
We're in big fucking trouble.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.213
I mean, some sick shit man.

59:14.351 --> 59:15.984
- All right, everybody ready?

59:17.354 --> 59:19.321
Let's make this a great show.

59:19.323 --> 59:20.522
One of our best.

59:21.659 --> 59:22.991
What do you say?

59:22.993 --> 59:24.092
- Hip hip hooray!

59:25.129 --> 59:25.961
- Hooray.

59:25.963 --> 59:26.795
(whooping)

59:26.797 --> 59:27.963
- Hooray.

59:27.965 --> 59:30.666
- [Speaker Voice] Places
please, cue sound.

59:30.668 --> 59:31.900
- Five,

59:31.902 --> 59:33.101
four,

59:33.103 --> 59:33.936
three.

59:33.938 --> 59:35.704
(bell ringing)

59:35.706 --> 59:38.340
- Boys and girls,
welcome once again

59:38.342 --> 59:42.044
to the Mr Jolly and
Handy Dandy show.

59:42.046 --> 59:42.978
(puppet laughing)

59:42.980 --> 59:44.246
(recording of children cheering)

59:44.248 --> 59:47.115
Have we got a special
show for you tonight.

59:47.117 --> 59:50.686
And for our special
studio audience Handy?

59:51.488 --> 59:52.821
- That's right Mr. Jolly,

59:52.823 --> 59:55.624
we've been working
extra hard tonight.

59:55.626 --> 59:58.427
(puppet laughing)

59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.596
- Have you been having fun?

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:02.631
- Oh you know it Mr. Jolly.

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:04.733
The gang and I have been
getting to know our friends

01:00:04.735 --> 01:00:06.268
real well.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:10.706
- Well speaking of guest,
let's meet them right now.

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:12.174
(recording of children cheering)

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:14.276
- What's this, some fucked
up Howdy Doody ripoff?

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:15.444
This shit is insane.

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:18.647
Did you see what
they did to Rick?

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.318
- Handy, why don't
you do the honors?

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:26.288
- Certainly Mr. Jolly.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:31.360
In the tool shed we have the
amazing, living, robot lady.

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.495
- Doc.

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:34.796
- Holy shit, let her go.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:40.802
- Oh Handy, we probably should
have explained the rules

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:44.306
more fully to our
special guests.

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.408
Nicky, would you
please tell the boy

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:49.378
what's expected of
them on our show?

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.614
- Don't speak unless
you are spoken to.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:58.053
There are consequences
for breaking the rules.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:01.623
- What consequences?

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.826
- What did I just tell you?

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:05.994
(dramatic music)

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.897
(muffled yelling)

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:13.368
(electricity pulsing)

01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:16.972
- Good boys.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:20.575
And what would our show
be, boys and girls,

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:22.511
without the peanut gallery?

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:25.047
But, I don't see them.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.082
Where could they be?

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:29.885
- We know Mr. Jolly.
- We know Mr. Jolly.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:31.586
We know, we know.

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:32.854
- [Female Puppet]
We know Mr. Jolly.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.222
(laughing)

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:37.125
(dramatic music)

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:43.198
- And last but not least,
let's meet the newest member

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.034
of our puppet family, shall we?

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.270
Please welcome

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:49.371
Abby!

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:53.475
(recording of children cheering)

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:57.479
- You're a monster.

01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:00.182
(intense music)

01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:05.353
(muffled screaming)

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:10.258
- Well boys and girls
at home, it's game time.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.526
Let's play, shall we?

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:15.530
Let's meet our first
contestant, Rosie.

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:17.432
Hi Rosie, are you having fun?

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:19.901
- Oh yeah, this freak
show's a barrel of laughs.

01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:23.004
- Well since you're
an athletic fellow,

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:25.207
we have an athletic
game for you.

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:26.441
So Rosie,

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:28.577
what do you say?

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:32.714
- You killed Josie,
freaking cut Rick's throat,

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:34.750
God knows what the hell
you're doing to Doc and Abby,

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.118
I think that's enough man.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.487
You had your jollies fucker.

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.724
Who's ever left living,
walk on out of here.

01:02:42.726 --> 01:02:44.726
Let us go you sick old fuck.

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:48.063
(recording of audience booing)

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:50.799
(intense music)

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.202
- What's the matter Mr. Jolly?

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:55.036
- He's ruining everything.

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:56.271
He's ruining the show.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:57.572
He's ruining everything,
we waited 50 years.

01:02:57.574 --> 01:02:59.841
We all waited for this
night, this one night.

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:03.745
And now he, he's
ruining the show.

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:05.013
He's ruining everything Handy.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.783
- It's a fuck enough.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:10.819
Let us go.

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:12.487
- He won't play.

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.189
He says, "No."

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:15.791
He says, "No."

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:18.794
And Rosie says, "No means no."

01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:23.865
- Oh well, I heard
that's not what he says

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:26.201
to his little girlfriends.

01:03:26.203 --> 01:03:28.503
(children laughing)
- No?

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:29.738
- No.

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.974
He likes it rough,
even if they don't.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:35.610
In fact, I heard he-

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:38.280
(whispering)

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:40.215
- I have nothing to do
with shit like that.

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:41.750
- Oh no?

01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:43.785
- Fuck no, they
all for themselves.

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:45.554
- 10 of you at once?

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:50.192
- Rosie?

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.426
Rosie?

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:52.994
- It's not like that.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.763
- It's exactly like that.

01:03:54.765 --> 01:03:56.932
- That's enough, let us go.
- That's enough, let us go.

01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:58.967
- That's enough, let us go.
- That's enough, let us go.

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:01.102
(overlapping puppet voices)

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:02.971
(puppet laughing)

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:04.105
- Oh Handy,

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:08.944
you always know
just what to say.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:11.847
Good boy.

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:15.283
- Thank you Mr. Jolly.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:17.519
Now, let's play.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:18.453
(recording of children cheering)

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:21.223
- Yes, right you are Handy.

01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:23.158
Let's play the game.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.328
So Rosie, what do you say?

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:29.564
- I'll play your
stupid game, jackass.

01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:32.767
- Hip hip hooray!
- Hip hip hooray!

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:35.537
(puppets cheering)

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:38.840
- Nicky would you explain
the rules please to Rosie?

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:41.243
- Certainly boss.

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.879
Contestant Rosie,
all you have to do

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:47.282
is throw the ping-pong
balls into the bucket.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:49.551
If you miss, you lose.

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:50.619
- What do I lose?

01:04:50.621 --> 01:04:51.853
- Your hand.

01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:54.756
But, good news, you
got two of those.

01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:56.524
You got two chances.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:57.959
- Yeah, what happens
if I do that?

01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:00.028
- We don't slice Doc.

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:02.731
- How am I supposed
to do this game?

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.233
I can't stand, remember?

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.601
Your freaking puppets
took care of that.

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:08.236
- We don't care, use the chair.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.204
- We don't care,

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:11.006
use the chair.
- We don't care,

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:11.840
use the chair.

01:05:11.842 --> 01:05:13.241
- Shut up.

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:14.776
- Not a very nice guest.

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:17.679
- Hand me the damn ball.

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.114
- Music please.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:20.715
(dramatic music)

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:22.417
Drum roll please.

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:26.755
(drums rolling)

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:38.667
(recording of children cheering)

01:05:38.669 --> 01:05:39.601
- Hey!

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.437
(dramatic music)

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:51.012
(recording of children cheering)

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:52.447
- Oh.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:55.283
(dramatic music)

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:58.219
(audience booing)

01:05:58.221 --> 01:05:59.688
- [Female Puppet] Uh oh.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:02.357
(intense music)

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:05.527
- Give the man his prize.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.730
- No, get away from me.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.032
(shouting)

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:15.103
(screaming and groaning)

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:17.906
(dramatic music)

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:26.614
- What a great contestant
boys and girls.

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:28.249
Let's give him a hand.

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:29.150
(audience clapping)

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.487
(puppet chuckling)

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:36.825
Boys and girls, do we
have a surprise for you.

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:41.363
A very special guest
for our next game.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:44.332
(mysterious music)

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:51.673
- Steffen, oh thank God.

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:55.310
- Our last game was so
much fun boys and girls,

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:56.945
let's try another.

01:06:56.947 --> 01:06:59.481
Steffen, it's your turn.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:02.083
We're going to ask you a
simple geography question

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.219
and Richard here
will be the judge

01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:06.021
of whether you're
right or wrong.

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:08.023
If you're right,

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:12.127
then we'll just shoot
some gas at Abby.

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:16.164
If you're wrong,
we'll break something.

01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:19.167
You got that Steffen?

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:20.068
- What?

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:22.270
What are you doing?

01:07:23.774 --> 01:07:26.074
Look what you've
done to these kids.

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.676
- My puppets love to play.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.547
Handy Dandy?

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.616
Take it away.

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.551
- All right, you
remember the rules,

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:39.821
I ask a simple geography
question and you have to answer.

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:41.723
The judge will decide
if you're correct.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.559
And if so, Abby will get gassed.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:48.463
If not, we'll, uh, we'll
break your arm or something.

01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:49.364
Ready?

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:55.837
Steffen, what is the
capital city of Montana?

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:56.805
- What the hell?

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:00.241
Boise?

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:04.345
(audience laughing)

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:05.880
- Correct.

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:07.549
- Uh, not really.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:08.883
It's Helena.

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:10.385
Helena.

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:12.921
But a game's a game and
the judge has ruled.

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.656
Sugar, hit the gas.

01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:15.857
- [Sugar] Yeah.

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.326
(audience cheering
and whistling)

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:21.796
(intense music)

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:23.398
- That's enough Sugar.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.866
We have more questions.

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:29.904
Mr. Soundbad, could
you turn the sound up

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:31.872
on Abby for us please?

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.709
(Abby screaming)

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:37.444
Okay, that's enough.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:38.712
Turn the sound down.

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:42.550
All right Steffen,

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.719
let's make this next
round more interesting.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.522
She can't take much more gas.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:50.625
This time Richard,
if Steffen is wrong,

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.595
we don't break something,

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:58.265
we take something.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.037
Stop this, there's no point.

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:05.974
- Oh yes, there is
boys and girls at home.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.908
Of course there's a
point, isn't there?

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:10.377
Let's tell Mr.
Richard the point.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.948
I need hearts to live and
tonight's the only night

01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:15.416
I can take them.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.585
You know that very well,
otherwise, why are you here?

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:18.886
- To stop you.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:23.591
- Well congratulations
on your raging success.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.895
- The night's not
over yet you bastard.

01:09:26.897 --> 01:09:30.031
- Almost, it's almost over.

01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:32.901
Handy, next question.

01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:36.837
- How many square miles
are there in Texas?

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.573
(intense music)

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:44.779
- No normal person
would know that answer.

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:47.814
- [Handy] You have 10 seconds.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.654
- 20 million?

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.424
(recording of children laughing)

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:59.160
(intense music)

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:05.300
- Correct.
- No, 268,000.

01:10:05.302 --> 01:10:07.936
- Oh you truly are

01:10:07.938 --> 01:10:11.406
a terrible character Richard.

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:16.711
Sugar, you heard the man.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:19.948
Gas her.

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:21.783
- [Sugar] Okay Mr. Jolly.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:23.284
(gas hissing)

01:10:23.286 --> 01:10:25.853
(tense music)

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:31.960
- I'm sorry.

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:37.732
- It only took you 10 minutes
to become a child killer.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:41.035
- You killed her, you fucker.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:48.610
- Well let's make this next
round very interesting.

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:51.212
You've known Doc since
she was a little girl.

01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:54.849
Ah, intellectual
Doc, idealistic Doc.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.618
What wonderful things she
could do for humanity.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.054
Just think of the changes
she could make in this world,

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:01.322
while Steffen,

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:07.428
well Steffen's goal is to
open a decadent, high-end,

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.798
super model-laden night club.

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.434
So, this time,

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.237
if Steffen is right,

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:22.143
Doc gets the saw
in the tool shed.

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:23.811
And if he's wrong,

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:28.149
we'll take two of his limbs.

01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:31.619
- And what if I refuse to judge?

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:35.290
- Oh then we'll take three.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:41.663
Steffen, at anytime,

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.465
you can stop the game

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:49.537
by accepting the consequences
and saving your friend.

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:52.206
(tense music)

01:11:56.513 --> 01:11:57.378
Doc,

01:11:58.782 --> 01:12:00.348
you're his last living friend.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:07.488
Do you think he'll lose
two arms and possibly a leg

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.556
to save you?

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:14.362
Or, will he just let her die?

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:18.399
Let's find out.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:19.834
- You're insane Jolly.

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:24.739
- Last question.

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:27.508
(tense music)

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.310
- Who's your grandfather?

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:33.081
- Richard William Crane.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:33.981
- Correct.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.754
(chain saw buzzing)

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:46.427
(audience clapping
and whistling)

01:12:46.429 --> 01:12:49.230
(tense music)

01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:51.933
- But Steffen is
unfortunately not correct.

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:52.800
- What?

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.003
Richard William
Crane is my father.

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.338
There's no doubt about it.

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:01.342
- I think there is.

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.880
Your mother was pregnant
before she met him.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.416
Oh, did she fail to
mention that to you?

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:12.887
Do you know, Richard William
Crane is not your true father?

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:13.788
- No.

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:16.391
(audience gasping)

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:18.092
Mr. Jolly is your father.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.460
- No, that's impossible.

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.131
- Let them go children.

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:25.400
- Are you sure about
that Mr. Jolly?

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:29.036
- There's no escape
for Richard now.

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:29.937
He knows that.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.941
The show is over.

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:35.543
- All right boys, you heard him.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:36.444
Let him loose.

01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:40.014
- [Puppet] Okay boss.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:41.349
Lucky fuckers.

01:13:41.351 --> 01:13:43.518
- [Steffen] Is he
my grandfather?

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.353
- No, can't be.

01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:46.421
- Really?

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:48.923
Why do you think
your mother came

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.125
to so many of my performances?

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:53.261
She hardly missed one.

01:13:53.263 --> 01:13:55.463
Beautiful woman, your mother.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:57.765
- What does that prove?

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:01.302
- Why do you think you
escaped all those years ago

01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:03.638
when every other boy
in that field died?

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:08.643
- I ran, I ran, you
said so yourself.

01:14:09.479 --> 01:14:10.812
(laughing)

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:12.079
- Look at my puppets.

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:14.782
You really think you
could get away from them

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.250
if they wanted to catch you?

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.219
They let you go.

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:19.821
- That's right, we did.

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:21.622
Some of our best acting ever.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.758
But then again, fooling
a kid as dumb as you

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.626
was easy as apple pie.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:26.961
- You murdering little liar.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:27.962
(electricity buzzing)

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.964
(groaning)

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:32.533
(tense music)

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:37.605
- If you're his father,
is my dad a magician?

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:39.006
- Oh it's in the blood.

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:42.977
- Is it in mine?

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.749
- Let's find out.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:51.552
(dramatic music)

01:14:58.862 --> 01:15:00.628
- Get away from him you fucker.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:05.066
- Richard, I'm gonna
give you another chance

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:07.201
to be a better man
than I think you are.

01:15:08.438 --> 01:15:09.570
You can walk away,

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:13.541
but Steffen stays here
with my puppets and me.

01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:17.211
Or he can leave
and you can stay.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:20.515
(tense music)

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:22.216
- Let Steffen go.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:25.052
I'll stay and play with you
and your little monsters.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:27.622
(tense music)

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:30.825
- How touching.

01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:32.460
I bet you didn't know he cared.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.566
- Oh Richard,

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:40.568
really?

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:43.137
(tense music)

01:15:51.314 --> 01:15:52.446
You found the dagger.

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:56.083
- Yes, it wasn't where
you were looking for it.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.785
It wasn't in the ruins.

01:15:58.755 --> 01:16:00.821
I told you I came defended.

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:03.124
- Let me have the dagger.

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:05.092
The power of the
Kandarian artifact

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:07.595
won't work for you and
you're out of your depth.

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:08.763
- Game changer.

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:12.333
You won't have me or my son.

01:16:12.335 --> 01:16:15.236
(audience reacting)

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:17.672
(electricity buzzing)

01:16:17.674 --> 01:16:19.073
- Children!

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:20.107
Children!
(puppet yelling)

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:23.611
(intense music)

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:26.747
(puppets crying out)

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.139
(Handy yelling)

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:54.308
- Children, no, come back!

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.209
Come back!

01:16:56.746 --> 01:16:58.479
(sobbing)

01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:01.248
(dramatic music)

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:04.452
- I want my children.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:07.588
- I thought I was
your child, father!

01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:09.924
- You

01:17:09.926 --> 01:17:11.492
are nothing to me!

01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:15.262
(electricity buzzing)

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:16.163
- Steffen!

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:20.167
You will take no more, no more!

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:25.339
I love you son.

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.575
(yelling)

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:35.883
(sad music)

01:18:19.429 --> 01:18:21.929
¶ Now children, do we
know what day it is? ¶

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:23.297
¶ The Handy Dandy show ¶

01:18:23.299 --> 01:18:27.201
