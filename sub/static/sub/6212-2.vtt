WEBVTT

00:03.924 --> 00:07.063
Yes! Evil waffle-iron, you finally make your match.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.023
Your reign of tyranny has finally...

00:10.199 --> 00:12.254
Look, jokes. I mean that's the way I like it.

00:13.409 --> 00:18.858
Breakfast is ready!
Miles, Morgan, Roxie!

00:19.365 --> 00:21.783
Breakfast!

00:23.080 --> 00:24.921
C'mon, people.

00:24.956 --> 00:26.338
Free food.

00:28.199 --> 00:30.031
Fine, have it your way.

00:34.194 --> 00:35.947
I heard crowing.

00:35.985 --> 00:37.454
Is my mother here?

00:37.479 --> 00:40.069
Feds, illegal search and seizure!
Please help me to hide these films!

00:40.111 --> 00:42.796
Sorry, sorry! It was just me practising my barrier call.

00:44.928 --> 00:49.120
Look, I've made us a first day of college life doesn't get any better
than this breakfast.

00:50.157 --> 00:53.112
Look, old McDonald, it was very hard to make sure

00:53.147 --> 00:56.224
my first class doesn't start until 3.
Good day and good night!

00:57.180 --> 01:00.206
That's funny because I totally had you beg
for a morning person.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.053
Miles, what are you doing?

01:04.382 --> 01:06.898
I made us waffles, and bacon, and eggs.

01:06.925 --> 01:08.643
Do you have any idea where bacon and eggs come from?

01:08.678 --> 01:10.834
Pigs and chicken butts?

01:10.879 --> 01:13.219
Government subsidized farms.

01:13.244 --> 01:15.491
They fed chemicals and hormones.
It's not natural.

01:15.526 --> 01:19.019
Sorry, Sabrina. My body is my temple.

01:19.064 --> 01:21.429
So, you're filling it with secret sugar barms?

01:21.454 --> 01:23.454
It's turning milk purple.

01:25.602 --> 01:27.421
Don't let them bother you, Sabrina.

01:27.466 --> 01:31.390
Your enthusiasm for college is exactly what we need around here.

01:31.415 --> 01:33.892
Thank you, Morgan. At least someone appreciates me.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.891
Put me down for a French toast tomorrow.

01:35.919 --> 01:38.029
Put me down for a year, right?

01:40.437 --> 01:42.957
Well, Foghorn, I guess it's just you and me.

01:50.889 --> 01:53.720
Sabrina, The Teenage Witch
S05E02 - Double Time

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.346 --> 02:26.264
You know, as sad as I'm about Sabrina beeing off for college

02:26.314 --> 02:29.231
I love having time to feel my life with new meaning.

02:29.256 --> 02:31.141
What do you think about acrylics?

02:31.184 --> 02:33.494
Oh, I like them. But I'm proud if I'll get some.

02:34.819 --> 02:37.126
Watch the dewclaw.

02:37.151 --> 02:39.038
Too bad Zelda is not coping like I am.

02:39.073 --> 02:42.128
For her, the world begins, middles, and ends with Sabrina.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.328
Sabrina, where've I heard that name?

02:44.373 --> 02:47.801
Oh, yes, Audrey Hepburn. Wonderful film.

02:47.826 --> 02:50.165
Knowing Zelda, she will be moping around for weeks.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.941
I got it!
I got it!

02:52.207 --> 02:56.226
You are looking at a new Associate Professor of Quantum Physics.

02:56.251 --> 02:58.553
Yeah, she's a wreck cove.

02:58.588 --> 03:00.016
Where are you gonna be teaching?

03:00.051 --> 03:01.496
Adams College.

03:01.531 --> 03:02.951
Adams College?

03:03.267 --> 03:05.328
Ah, this sounds familiar?

03:05.363 --> 03:08.153
Oh, I know!
That's Sabrina's college.

03:08.195 --> 03:09.692
How pathetic is that?

03:09.727 --> 03:11.795
I know it looks like I took this job to be near

03:11.823 --> 03:14.403
Sabrina but I've always dreamed of being a teacher.

03:14.448 --> 03:17.469
I'm moving on with my life, Hilda. And so should you.

03:17.514 --> 03:18.913
Already way ahead of you.

03:18.938 --> 03:22.793
Really? So, tell me how do you plan to spend your time after the clock shop's gone under.

03:22.818 --> 03:25.034
Oh, please, there aren't many hours in the day.

03:25.069 --> 03:27.138
I'm more productive now that I've ever been.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.657
If you'll excuse me I have to prepare Salem a bath.

03:31.313 --> 03:32.960
Are you insane, woman?

03:32.995 --> 03:35.298
My nails aren't dry.

03:36.318 --> 03:37.921
I can't belive I'm actuall here.

03:37.956 --> 03:41.866
Sabrina Spellman, college student, coed,

03:41.901 --> 03:43.649
independent woman in the world.

03:43.684 --> 03:45.804
I feel celebratory will hook coming on me.

03:47.443 --> 03:50.349
Sabrina, you are a very lucky freshman.

03:50.381 --> 03:54.655
You have at your disposal this school's most knowledgeable tour guide.

03:54.683 --> 03:56.974
Well, until she shows up why don't you give me the tour?

03:58.239 --> 04:00.039
Oh, do you know where the Psychology Building is?

04:00.074 --> 04:01.759
No idea.

04:01.794 --> 04:03.180
What about History?

04:03.225 --> 04:04.872
Got me again.

04:04.897 --> 04:06.721
Do you know where anything is on this campus?

04:06.756 --> 04:09.137
I know that a men swim team has lunch

04:09.182 --> 04:11.138
on a quiet every afternoon.

04:11.163 --> 04:14.265
But you've got to get there early 'cause you could see it's filled out fast.

04:16.118 --> 04:18.952
Don't know where my classes are but I know where I eat lunch.

04:20.349 --> 04:23.583
I can't tell you how excited we are to have you on our faculty, professor.

04:23.618 --> 04:26.624
Yes, that's what you've been doing for the last 20 minutes.

04:27.581 --> 04:29.271
Aunt Zelda?

04:29.306 --> 04:31.127
Oh, Sabrina?
Will you excuse me, gentlemen.

04:32.907 --> 04:34.503
Ha-ha.

04:34.538 --> 04:36.767
Sorry to interupt your little singles mixer but

04:36.802 --> 04:38.429
what's going on here?

04:38.529 --> 04:41.285
Men, you can take the Nobel laureate out of a boy,

04:41.320 --> 04:42.670
- but you can't take the boy...
- No.

04:42.705 --> 04:44.358
I mean what are you doing here?

04:44.393 --> 04:47.073
Please tell, professor is just an exotic nickname you're trying out?

04:47.108 --> 04:48.856
Sabrina, I know how this must look.

04:48.891 --> 04:50.256
Like exactly what it is.

04:50.301 --> 04:52.571
I'm supposed to be embarked on a journey of independent sub discovery

04:52.604 --> 04:54.913
but there is no aunt in independence.

04:54.947 --> 04:57.455
There is an aunt. But that's another story.

04:57.483 --> 05:00.361
Obviously, honey, my new job has nothing to do with you.

05:00.406 --> 05:03.537
Yeah, right here I'm trying to go to college like a regular mortal.

05:03.562 --> 05:05.688
But my other realm aunt thinks I can't handle it on my own.

05:05.723 --> 05:08.112
Well, I've got news for you. I can and I will.

05:08.147 --> 05:09.504
Sabrina!

05:09.539 --> 05:11.440
And while we are at school we don't know each other.
Is that clear, aunt Zelda?

05:11.475 --> 05:12.924
Very clear.

05:13.608 --> 05:15.769
And it's Professor Spellman to you.

05:15.804 --> 05:17.253
Good. And it's

05:17.295 --> 05:18.696
Sabrina to you.

05:18.724 --> 05:20.361
Hey, congratulations of a new job!

05:20.396 --> 05:22.057
Thanks, I'm really excited.

05:27.885 --> 05:30.103
Gotta get one of those book bags of wheels.

05:30.138 --> 05:31.799
Oh, maybe a pack mule.

05:31.844 --> 05:35.173
What's wrong perky?
First day of Sabrina's wonderful life's hitting a brick wall?

05:35.208 --> 05:37.493
No, not at all.
It's very wonderful.

05:37.518 --> 05:40.720
I've only been in college for 3 hours and already I get to read

05:40.770 --> 05:44.562
4 chapters of Plato, write a 10-page essay, and catch a small arthropod to disect.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.778
Maybe, I ought to rethink my definition of the word "wonderful".

05:48.470 --> 05:50.994
Hey, college girl. How was the big first day?

05:51.029 --> 05:52.561
Bigger than I expected.

05:52.596 --> 05:54.075
But still wonderful.

05:54.391 --> 05:56.178
Josh, this is my roommate, Roxie.

05:56.213 --> 05:58.145
Hi, Roxie.
Great name.

05:58.180 --> 06:00.681
You know I had this girl at school named Roxie.

06:00.716 --> 06:03.392
I used to call her Foxy Roxie.

06:03.956 --> 06:07.184
And today you're wiping tables for living.
I'm shocked.

06:07.219 --> 06:08.880
Nice to meet you too.

06:09.235 --> 06:11.334
Don't mind her. She's a way a little pranky before...

06:12.395 --> 06:14.002
She's just cranky.

06:14.103 --> 06:17.238
Sabrina, Emerson's having a huge kick-off party tonight.

06:17.273 --> 06:18.902
They've party on Monday night?

06:18.946 --> 06:21.695
This is college. They've parties every night.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.325
After I leave your name at the door.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.074
Oh My Gosh!
Oh My Gosh!

06:26.109 --> 06:28.866
A college party.
I'm so excited.

06:28.901 --> 06:30.394
Whatever will I wear?

06:32.719 --> 06:34.713
I think she was being sarcastic.

06:34.748 --> 06:36.282
Yeah, I got that.

06:36.317 --> 06:37.750
Anyway, you'll be there, right?

06:37.785 --> 06:39.213
I can't.

06:39.258 --> 06:40.766
I've got tons of work to do.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.065
I'm falling for the behind as we speak.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.280
Oh, so what? There's always something to do.

06:45.315 --> 06:47.304
Just have to learn how to juggle your priorities.

06:51.091 --> 06:53.478
Hey, Roxie, could you do something with that music?

06:53.506 --> 06:54.975
Oh, sure.

06:55.437 --> 06:58.280
Actually, by "do something" I meant to turn it off.

06:58.315 --> 07:00.471
And again we are in the mess.

07:00.496 --> 07:02.318
Why were you sticking to pick up a fight?

07:02.353 --> 07:04.763
I'm not fighting. I just can't study with the music on. That's all.

07:04.798 --> 07:06.215
And I can't study with it off.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.665
So, what are we gonna do?

07:07.700 --> 07:10.528
Well, since you woke me up for first class breakfast I think you owe me.

07:10.553 --> 07:13.078
Well, getting to make you lunch I'm being in debt forever.

07:20.905 --> 07:23.188
Hey, you're stuck to those Plato's dialogues too?

07:23.215 --> 07:24.868
Do you have any idea what the first was about?

07:25.401 --> 07:28.693
I'm not sure but if you think the first word

07:28.728 --> 07:33.902
of each paragraph. It makes the sentence.
"Mine enemy goes in green shoes."

07:35.745 --> 07:38.403
Maybe, we should read quietly to ourselves.

07:43.471 --> 07:49.042
For your gastrointestinal pleasure, another delicious Helda Spellman's original recipee.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.722
Guess, what's in it?

07:50.757 --> 07:52.841
I don't care.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.140
Guess, what I like in you, Salem?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.588
You're a culinary adventurer.

07:56.623 --> 07:58.820
So much nicer than a big fat pig.

07:59.337 --> 08:01.692
What an invigorating day!

08:01.727 --> 08:04.928
Feeling eager young minds with the knowledge,

08:04.973 --> 08:07.147
challenging debates. I mean the whole game done

08:07.172 --> 08:09.520
at the T.G.I. Friday's for margaritas and crazy fries.

08:10.595 --> 08:12.842
Oh, I feel so alive.

08:12.884 --> 08:16.033
Hildy, make the big scary lady go away.

08:16.061 --> 08:19.137
Zelda, would you mind taking your self-absorption for a walk?

08:19.182 --> 08:21.570
Hilda, what on Earth are you doing?

08:21.595 --> 08:24.957
Don't tell me you spent your entire day doting on that cat.

08:24.998 --> 08:26.626
I haven't been doting.

08:26.655 --> 08:28.171
I say I gave him a few beauty treatments.

08:28.206 --> 08:30.300
Read to him, cooked for him.

08:30.335 --> 08:33.061
And made a delightfully amusing puppet show.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.148
Listen, Hilda.

08:35.183 --> 08:38.365
Sometimes when a person experiences a loss,

08:38.400 --> 08:40.750
say, a loved one goes away to college.

08:40.784 --> 08:42.948
They project their feelings on someone else.

08:42.984 --> 08:44.645
Say, a worthless cat.

08:45.217 --> 08:47.524
They do this as the way of sublimating anxiety.

08:48.351 --> 08:49.978
Do you understand what I'm saying?

08:50.013 --> 08:53.251
You mouth moves, sound comes out, and yet, nothing.

08:56.317 --> 09:00.143
Okay, I've gone through understanding Plato and understanding understanding Plato.

09:00.178 --> 09:02.248
Now what I need is Plato for dummies.

09:02.283 --> 09:04.600
Oh, better yet. Plato.

09:07.199 --> 09:09.599
Look, Plato, I know you are the foundation of western thought and stuff.

09:09.626 --> 09:12.465
But you seem to be talking in circles.
Can you help me out here?

09:15.457 --> 09:17.344
I wrote this to empress someone I was seeing.

09:17.386 --> 09:18.903
It'd better be Olympics.

09:18.931 --> 09:20.920
A Vestal Virgin.
Yeah, right.

09:21.733 --> 09:23.600
Do you have any nectar?

09:24.551 --> 09:26.894
Greeks, conceive lucky, bad explanations.

09:26.929 --> 09:29.767
Oh, you want an explanation.
It's all about reason.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.747
You've got a power of reason and a couple of drachmas

09:31.782 --> 09:33.639
in your toga. You're sitting pretty.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.127
Ugly enough but helps.

09:35.162 --> 09:36.655
Thanks, Plato.

09:37.837 --> 09:41.280
Okay, that made Plato.
Next step's my 10-page essay

09:41.305 --> 09:42.782
on Franco-Prussian War.

09:42.827 --> 09:45.992
I was just gonna throw this away. The syrop is hard as a rock.

09:46.017 --> 09:49.254
But then I thought it may have some kitschy sentimental value for you.

09:49.578 --> 09:51.652
Do I look like I have time for dishes right now?

09:51.687 --> 09:53.909
I'm overwhelmed with work and it is only my first day.

09:53.951 --> 09:57.123
Relax. Every freshman goes through this.

09:57.151 --> 10:01.588
It's just the college as a way
of getting rid of the weak.
Calling her. Wow!

10:01.623 --> 10:03.317
You've got invited to the Emerson party?

10:03.352 --> 10:04.734
Yeah, but I can't go.

10:04.769 --> 10:07.854
The guy I cheated an Ethics class has a brother who goes to Emerson.

10:07.889 --> 10:10.029
My friend put me and Roxie on the guest list.

10:10.064 --> 10:12.301
But I've got studying to do.

10:12.336 --> 10:13.735
Sabrina...

10:14.074 --> 10:17.268
As a resident adviser,
I must tell you that Adams College

10:17.303 --> 10:20.507
values life experience as much as does the academics.

10:20.552 --> 10:24.466
The last thing that you wanna do is neglect the social arena.

10:24.501 --> 10:28.026
I've got a lot of work to get done.
But I don't think college get mad

10:28.051 --> 10:29.785
on me on not partying enough.

10:29.820 --> 10:31.849
The key here is balance.

10:31.884 --> 10:33.754
It's 9 o'clock. Why don't you go for an hour?

10:34.010 --> 10:35.990
In fact, why I don't go with you?

10:36.025 --> 10:38.227
And then you'll come back fresh, rejuvenated

10:38.262 --> 10:40.195
and ready to attack the academics.

10:40.230 --> 10:42.275
You don't think that'll be too distracting?

10:42.310 --> 10:44.675
Sabrina, it's my job to advise you.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.322
What I steer you wrong?

10:46.357 --> 10:51.130
Well, like the college lads like to say:
Party! Party! Party!

10:57.655 --> 10:59.363
I can't believe I've almost missed this.

10:59.398 --> 11:00.915
I know. If you miss the Monday party

11:00.960 --> 11:03.140
there's nothing to talk about
at the Tuesday party.

11:03.165 --> 11:05.043
But then Wednesday. You'll never catch up.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.010
Sabrina!

11:07.045 --> 11:08.493
Hey, finally!

11:09.092 --> 11:10.766
I didn't think we are gonna make it.

11:10.801 --> 11:12.791
Yeah, I have to do some studying before I could got loose.

11:12.826 --> 11:14.928
Oh, I'll go with party first, study later.

11:14.963 --> 11:17.200
Wow! You're an animal. It's already 2:30.

11:17.235 --> 11:18.591
Well, you're not me...

11:18.626 --> 11:19.983
2:30?

11:20.018 --> 11:22.624
I've got to do a paper in 6 hours. Gotta go.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.019
Oh, oh! I've just got here!

11:24.046 --> 11:26.032
Sabrina, you can't leave until you introduce me your friend.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.224
Morgan, Josh.
Josh, Morgan. Is everybody happy?

11:28.692 --> 11:30.095
Yeah.

11:30.130 --> 11:31.545
Very.
Lucky freshman's

11:31.580 --> 11:33.128
coming through.

11:35.436 --> 11:37.454
Hey, I can do this.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.694
Just type about that bad war and we are in business.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.991
No problem.
Morgan was right.

11:43.894 --> 11:48.134
I just feel refreshed, rejuvenated and ready to attack...

12:03.343 --> 12:04.726
Sabrina?

12:07.614 --> 12:09.071
Sabrina!

12:09.106 --> 12:10.855
What's going on?
Am I finished?

12:10.897 --> 12:13.709
I didn't wanna wake you. But drool tends to short your keyboard.

12:14.282 --> 12:16.492
Oh, I'm glad you did.
I've a paper due...

12:16.534 --> 12:18.115
in 30 minutes.

12:18.143 --> 12:19.893
All I've done is typed my name.

12:19.928 --> 12:21.741
Sardina Smellman?

12:21.776 --> 12:23.269
It's getting near.

12:23.304 --> 12:24.853
Focus.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.588
Okay, you can do this.

12:28.872 --> 12:30.304
No, I can't.

12:31.220 --> 12:33.247
Oh, I can't zap a paper. That would be cheating.

12:33.282 --> 12:35.679
But maybe I can use a magical pick me up.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.496
Faster, speedy, quick.

12:42.531 --> 12:45.769
Glad you're here.
Maybe, you can roll me over.

12:45.804 --> 12:47.754
I wanna get that source.

12:47.789 --> 12:49.205
Salem, what happend to you?

12:49.240 --> 12:51.748
I've got life.
La dolce vita, baby!

12:51.783 --> 12:54.510
Apparently, the life doesn't come in a low-fat version.

12:54.545 --> 12:56.365
I think I can read well.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.207
I don't think you can even be carried out of this room.

12:59.743 --> 13:01.832
Okay, here's something about a double-time spell.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.847
It helps you get your work done twice as fast.

13:03.882 --> 13:07.168
Speaking of fast.
I ordered fry 15 minutes ago.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.601
Hilda!

13:08.636 --> 13:11.864
Shhh, quiet. I don't want them to think I can't handle college

13:11.906 --> 13:13.263
because I can.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.776
It's just the social and the academic part I'm having trouble with.

13:17.793 --> 13:19.313
Okay, here it goes.

13:19.348 --> 13:21.976
Step lively, step quick, make me move lightning slip.

13:23.590 --> 13:25.593
Gentlemen, start your engine.

13:29.070 --> 13:30.439
Save and print.

13:35.507 --> 13:37.597
I could choose a listing faster. C'mon.

13:45.962 --> 13:49.413
Excellent! And I still have 20 seconds to get to class.

13:50.650 --> 13:53.676
Of course, Professor Flanagan. I'd love to discuss your theories.

13:53.703 --> 13:56.692
And just don't think the travelogies are in a proper environment.

13:58.852 --> 14:00.820
That blur looks strange and familiar.

14:01.672 --> 14:05.803
Alright, half a pound hand-ground organic dark-roasted brew.

14:05.838 --> 14:08.371
You're a life saver, Josh. I looked all over town for this.

14:08.406 --> 14:10.139
Well, there were only once.

14:10.174 --> 14:12.779
Unfortuantely, most people aren't that picky about what they drink.

14:12.814 --> 14:14.867
Well, Salem is not most people.

14:14.902 --> 14:16.468
Isn't Salem a cat?

14:16.503 --> 14:18.443
Your point being...

14:18.478 --> 14:21.843
No, I just think it's a little weird to buy a gourmet coffee for a cat.

14:21.878 --> 14:23.756
Any weirder than a tall brown man in a little red apron

14:23.791 --> 14:27.212
grinding roasted seeds. So, strangers can catch a bus.

14:27.247 --> 14:28.672
Don't judge me, bean boy!

14:32.180 --> 14:34.076
The blur looks strange and familiar.

14:35.933 --> 14:38.172
Oh, Sabrina, you startled me. I didn't see you come in.

14:38.207 --> 14:39.643
What do you want me to do?

14:39.678 --> 14:42.700
Oh, I hate to ask but the bathrooms could use a good one sober.

14:43.514 --> 14:45.682
Hey, what do you think about the party last night?

14:45.717 --> 14:47.757
I though it was by far the most amazing party...

14:47.792 --> 14:49.223
Done.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.255
Also amazing. Well, I just must observe zone down there for a minute.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.022
I'm going on my break.
Can you cover for me?

14:59.061 --> 15:00.584
Anything else?

15:00.619 --> 15:02.696
Sabrina, there're dozen people here waiting for...

15:02.731 --> 15:06.041
I had a little down time, so I polished the espresso machine.

15:06.076 --> 15:08.887
Well, I guess if you wanna cut out early then...

15:11.560 --> 15:14.184
Man, what a gift to be 18 again!

15:16.125 --> 15:19.040
Sorry, I'm late. It took forever to find the beans.

15:19.075 --> 15:23.304
And bad news.
The video store was out of "Space Balls".

15:23.585 --> 15:26.185
Quit murmuring, start cooking and get some

15:26.220 --> 15:28.066
quotes on the double wide litter bags.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.369
Alright, this has gone far enough.

15:30.404 --> 15:32.873
Sorry, Zelly, I can't talk right now.
I don't want Salem to get mad.

15:32.908 --> 15:34.793
You don't wanna make Salem mad?

15:34.828 --> 15:37.783
If you don't leave immediately I'll be forced to set on you!

15:38.419 --> 15:40.560
What you need is a healthy doze of reality.

15:44.337 --> 15:45.825
What did you do that for?

15:46.762 --> 15:48.166
Uhm, lemony?

15:48.201 --> 15:50.654
How can't you realize that you displaced your emotions

15:50.689 --> 15:52.285
for Sabrina onto Salem?

15:52.320 --> 15:55.670
And that he is taking a horrible, horrible advantage of you.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.630
You're right. What's become of me?
I don't even like being

15:58.688 --> 16:01.646
in the same room with him. Today I fostered by hospice.

16:02.043 --> 16:03.750
Try finding something to fill

16:03.785 --> 16:05.495
the void left by Sabrina.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.606
Something that you're passionate about.

16:07.641 --> 16:09.847
That's legal in the state of Massachusetts.

16:11.043 --> 16:14.141
Step easy, step slow, make me stop this go-go-go.

16:16.905 --> 16:19.844
Great spell. But tough on a high tops.

16:23.147 --> 16:25.196
Little help for a bloated feline.

16:28.609 --> 16:31.420
Okay, I had the most amazing date.

16:31.455 --> 16:34.275
I partied till 2 AM, still managed to finish my paper,

16:34.310 --> 16:37.428
do all my reading for the week, work, go to gym.

16:37.463 --> 16:40.286
I think I got a perfect spell.

16:40.321 --> 16:42.974
What's with slow and mow?

16:47.802 --> 16:50.630
Miles?
Miles, what's wrong with you?

16:50.665 --> 16:53.342
Good morning.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.126
I'm late for class.

16:57.161 --> 16:58.758
You haven't been in class yet?

16:58.793 --> 17:01.081
Roxie, you're just goofing around, right?

17:01.630 --> 17:04.480
You didn't do that double time spell, did ya?

17:05.568 --> 17:07.920
Of course, I did it. You were sprawled on the bed when I did it.

17:07.964 --> 17:10.434
Sabrina, where do you think the extra time comes from?

17:10.459 --> 17:12.358
You sucked it right out of them.

17:12.394 --> 17:14.454
Why couldn't I sucked it from something useless

17:14.490 --> 17:17.656
like a spleen or a 20 pounds of fat cat?

17:18.421 --> 17:19.965
I've got to try to get them back to normal.

17:23.114 --> 17:24.606
It's not working.

17:24.634 --> 17:27.520
Oh, no! If they don't get to class then it'll be an academic probation.

17:27.555 --> 17:29.017
It's all my fault.

17:30.473 --> 17:32.384
Morgan.
I can explain.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.600
If you can explain that top with those pants,

17:35.635 --> 17:37.640
you're a better woman than I am.

17:39.446 --> 17:41.441
Stupid, stupid spell.

17:41.877 --> 17:43.543
I gotta find the way to speed them up.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.992
I'm officially out of ideas.

18:13.027 --> 18:15.923
I've got one. Call your aunt Zelda and have her

18:15.966 --> 18:17.701
get you out of this mess.

18:17.728 --> 18:19.283
I can't. I told her I didn't need her help.

18:19.328 --> 18:21.639
Told I can handle everything on my own.

18:21.664 --> 18:24.348
To quote the great philosopher Rene Descartes:

18:24.383 --> 18:26.956
"Liar, liar, pants on fire".

18:29.007 --> 18:33.993
- So, if take A to be the atomic mass...
- What if A is unknown?

18:38.446 --> 18:40.907
So now you want my help.

18:40.942 --> 18:43.219
That's kind of what I looked for in a teacher.

18:45.061 --> 18:47.786
I thought you could handle everything on your own.

18:47.821 --> 18:49.730
I admit I have a cocky side.

18:49.758 --> 18:51.323
But I've never said I knew everything.

18:53.343 --> 18:55.876
Alright, apology accepted.

18:55.911 --> 18:58.532
Thanks. Shall I be more careful next time?

19:01.476 --> 19:04.396
I think I put too much supersonic tonic in that last fadge.

19:05.128 --> 19:07.795
Two drops of vital fire should bring them back to normal.

19:07.830 --> 19:10.002
Quick! I think they're carving out the floor.

19:15.535 --> 19:18.578
Have you done anything between Road Runner and Nurtle the Turtle?

19:18.613 --> 19:20.930
Time spells can be incredibly complicated.

19:20.965 --> 19:23.065
They require very precise measurements.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.700
This could take days.

19:24.735 --> 19:26.579
I don't have days.
By then they'll be...

19:28.203 --> 19:29.860
Right where they are now.

19:29.905 --> 19:33.037
Why don't you always make such a production of everything?

19:33.062 --> 19:37.235
A small sip of espresso and a little magical punch of a heart.

19:37.270 --> 19:38.798
Usually does the trick.

19:38.833 --> 19:40.655
What's going on?
How do I get out here?

19:40.690 --> 19:42.129
Who are you people? Staring out

19:42.164 --> 19:43.590
for probing.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.071
I can explain everything.

19:45.106 --> 19:47.141
Which one do you like better?
Overslept or alarm clock didng' go off?

19:47.176 --> 19:49.269
- Both classics.
- Can't go wrong in either way.

19:50.174 --> 19:52.096
Oh My God! I overslept!

19:52.131 --> 19:54.032
Ah! My alarm clock didn't go off.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.538
I thought I split the difference.

19:55.573 --> 19:56.946
Nice touch.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.138
Outta my way. I've got paper to turn in.

19:59.163 --> 20:01.895
Wait your turn, alien prank. I just overslept my future.

20:05.095 --> 20:07.592
Maybe, I could use a little magic to help them with their late assignments.

20:07.627 --> 20:11.015
No need. I'm sure I can work some my own magic on the professors.

20:11.050 --> 20:12.539
And I won't have to point.

20:12.574 --> 20:14.236
Thank you guys for helping me out...

20:14.271 --> 20:15.913
And for getting me out this mess...

20:15.948 --> 20:18.083
And for not loading much.

20:18.118 --> 20:21.994
My! You've only been to college for 2 days.
It takes a while to learn how to balance your time.

20:22.029 --> 20:23.874
She speaks from experience.

20:23.909 --> 20:28.050
And I have to admit,
it's nice to know you have no problem with your aunties.

20:28.085 --> 20:31.177
Well, at first I was a little annoyed
when you got a job at the university.

20:31.222 --> 20:32.948
But now I'm glad you to be so close-by.

20:32.973 --> 20:34.706
- Were you real mean that?
- Yeah!

20:34.741 --> 20:36.397
Well, then you'll be doubly glad.

20:36.432 --> 20:38.333
Why? You didn't get a job there too, did you?

20:38.368 --> 20:40.716
I think you both at school might force me to join the army.

20:40.751 --> 20:42.749
No, I didn't get a job at school.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.240
I bought the coffee house!

20:45.275 --> 20:46.728
I'll see you at work!

20:48.101 --> 20:50.857
Maybe, I should do in the navy. I do look better in blue.

20:57.204 --> 21:00.588
9:28. All study's ended up.
And lots of places to go.

21:03.356 --> 21:07.707
Guess what? I finished all my work. I understood at least half of it.
And now I'm free to party wity you.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.534
Great! Put up your streamers, take a chair and watch me to do

21:10.559 --> 21:13.341
logarithms. The first day took us? 3 hours in the morning.

21:14.128 --> 21:17.066
Just to clear this whoo-hoo.
It's... whoo-hoo!

21:17.204 --> 21:18.744
Have fun at the party.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.223
Oh, I wasn't invited to a party.

21:20.258 --> 21:22.111
I was just trying to find some fun to do.

21:23.026 --> 21:24.883
Hey, what's more fun than logarithms?

21:25.341 --> 21:27.176
A wild one, Spellman.

21:27.277 --> 21:31.277
La dolce vita, baby.
