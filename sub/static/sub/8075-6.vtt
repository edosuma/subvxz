[theme music]

00:09.009 --> 00:11.079
Good evening.

00:11.112 --> 00:15.716
My name is Roseanne Barr
Pentland Arnold Thomas, or as I

00:15.749 --> 00:18.752
like to call me, Roseanne.

00:18.786 --> 00:22.690
What you're about to see is the
original Roseanne show pilot.

00:22.723 --> 00:28.596
It has been lost for some
40 years along with my mind.

00:28.629 --> 00:32.966
The difference is that this
episode has been found.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.702
Love to all my fans.

00:34.735 --> 00:35.536
Enjoy.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.675
[happy music playing]

00:41.709 --> 00:44.078

[music playing]

01:35.363 --> 01:37.298
That's our Rosey!

01:37.331 --> 01:39.667
[laughs]

01:48.075 --> 01:50.978
[applause]

01:51.011 --> 01:52.446
Rosey, I'm home!

01:52.480 --> 01:54.448
[applause]

01:54.482 --> 01:57.385
My goodness, your
hat is pushed up.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.119
You must have had a
rough day at the office.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.655
It's that darn
Anderson account.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.191
How about a martini?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.358
Make it a double.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.926
I already did.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.895
[laughs]

02:07.928 --> 02:09.863
ALL: Hi, Dad!

02:09.897 --> 02:12.333
Hi, kids!

02:12.366 --> 02:14.835
Whoops, Stinky,
looks like someone

02:14.868 --> 02:16.103
forgot to wash his hands.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.771
Uh-oh, I'm in trouble!

02:22.776 --> 02:23.644
Bonjour, eh?

02:26.680 --> 02:29.450
David, you're in the
good old US of A now.

02:29.483 --> 02:33.521
I won't have you
speaking French Canadian.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.723
No, during your
War for Independence,

02:35.756 --> 02:37.525
you fought bravely
for your freedom.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.193
We in Canada, we
are too frightened

02:39.227 --> 02:42.796
and remain loyal to the crown.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.865
Well let's start eating
before it gets cold.

02:44.898 --> 02:45.699
Mm-hmm.

02:48.536 --> 02:51.171
Kitten, you look flushed.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.072
Oui, oui.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.173
She is flushed with amour!

02:53.207 --> 02:58.279
Mom Tonight you are
going on le date, eh?

02:58.312 --> 03:00.314
Le date?

03:00.348 --> 03:02.283
You just went out
last Friday night.

03:02.316 --> 03:06.620
Uh-oh, Becky's in trouble!

03:06.654 --> 03:08.922
Mother, help!

03:08.956 --> 03:12.926
Oh, now, dear, can't
she please go out tonight?

03:12.960 --> 03:15.463
All she has left of her
homework is just chemistry,

03:15.496 --> 03:17.698
and she's a girl, so
she'll never use it.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.636
Be home by 10:00

03:22.670 --> 03:23.571
Oh!

03:23.604 --> 03:24.705
Thanks, Dad!

03:24.738 --> 03:28.075
You're the best!

03:28.108 --> 03:31.412
That's why he wears the
Sansabelts in this family.

03:31.445 --> 03:36.550
[sighs] Well, I better get
cracking on that evening paper.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.587
It's on the coffee table
right next to your pipe.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.524
I've already ironed it
open to the sports page.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.527
That's my Rosey!

03:46.560 --> 03:49.963
Say, Deej, I was talking
to Coach Johnson this morning

03:49.997 --> 03:52.099
at the Rotary Club
prayer breakfast,

03:52.132 --> 03:53.501
and he mentioned
that football tryouts

03:53.534 --> 03:54.968
are just around the corner.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.937
Yeah, great.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.306
So we'll toss
that pigskin around

03:58.339 --> 03:59.139
after you clean your plate.

04:03.377 --> 04:07.448
Say, Stinky, I'd like to talk
to your brother for a minute,

04:07.481 --> 04:10.851
so could you go up
to your room, please?

04:10.884 --> 04:12.185
Come on, Stinky.

04:12.219 --> 04:15.088
My American [french] has a
look that gives me le creeps.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.593
Uh-oh, DJ's in trouble!

04:23.997 --> 04:26.900
Now, let's see if we can't
turn that frown upside down.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.340
You do want to play
football, now, don't you?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.342
Yeah, Dad wants me to.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.578
But yet, you also want to
play the guitar in your very

04:37.611 --> 04:39.347
own rock 'n' roll band.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.115
I sure do!

04:42.149 --> 04:44.418
Well, obviously
you cannot do both.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.887
That would be like me
trying to raise a family

04:46.920 --> 04:50.624
and have a job at the same time!

04:50.658 --> 04:52.793
And that could never work.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.162
Yeah, 'cause you're a girl.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.164
What am I gonna do, Mom?

04:57.197 --> 04:58.366
Don't you worry.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.701
You just go upstairs and
get a good night's sleep.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.573
Ow!

05:05.606 --> 05:06.607
Hey, toots!

05:06.640 --> 05:07.508
You gotta help!

05:07.541 --> 05:08.976
12 people just showed up.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.210
I've gotta borrow a turkey!

05:10.243 --> 05:12.780
A turkey?

05:12.813 --> 05:16.316
Well, luckily for you, I
just happened to have one.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.690
Cook at 350 for
one hour and voila!

05:22.723 --> 05:24.725
Thanks, Rosey, you
saved my marriage, again!

05:27.561 --> 05:30.998
Better get this home to Fred
or he'll spank my derriere

05:31.031 --> 05:31.932
till its red as the Kremlin.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.166
Bye-bye!

05:33.200 --> 05:34.001
And buy bonds!

05:37.137 --> 05:38.739
ANNOUNCER: "That's
Our Rosey" will

05:38.772 --> 05:42.610
return after this brief
commercial announcement.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.044
Hey, slugger.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.479
I heard you got
a visit at school

05:45.513 --> 05:46.847
from good old Reddy
Kilowatt today,

05:46.880 --> 05:48.949
talking about the
wonders of atomic power.

05:48.982 --> 05:49.850
We sure did.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.184
It was really neat.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.554
But I'm confused, Dad.

05:53.587 --> 05:57.458
I mean, aren't atomic bombs bad?

05:57.491 --> 05:58.659
Not if they're our bombs, son.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.063
You see, the atom
does play a vital part

06:03.096 --> 06:05.098
in our military
industrial complex,

06:05.132 --> 06:09.637
but it also has a lot of
good uses right here at home.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.573
This is a lump of coal.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.575
Notice how dirty
and smelly it is.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.909
Yuck!

06:15.943 --> 06:18.746
[chuckles] But
this is uranium.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.152
You'd have to fill a football
field 50 times with coal

06:25.185 --> 06:28.722
to equal the power
in this little devil.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.224
Neato!

06:31.258 --> 06:34.194
Soon if we're lucky,
every town in America

06:34.227 --> 06:36.730
will have their own
atomic power plant,

06:36.764 --> 06:39.032
and we'll all have electricity
that's too cheap to meter.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.872
Atomic power, coming
soon to hundreds

06:44.905 --> 06:46.306
of lucky little American towns.

06:55.549 --> 07:00.788
Well, Stinky and the
Deej are all tucked in.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.557
And these darned Communists
are up to their old tricks

07:03.591 --> 07:05.158
again.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.694
Need help?

07:06.727 --> 07:07.695
Oh, no, no, dear.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.862
You've worked hard all day.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.332
You just sit there
and enjoy your paper.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.801
[doorbell ringing]

07:13.834 --> 07:15.235
Hey, hey, little missy.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.069
Where's the fire?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.008
Hi, Mark.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.109
How are you?

07:22.142 --> 07:23.176
Oh, tip-topity, Beccs.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.616
Where's the fire, you ask?

07:28.649 --> 07:31.351
It's in her eyes.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.420
Here, these--
these are for you.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.255
Marzipans!

07:35.288 --> 07:37.925
They're dreamy!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.527
You ready to go, Beccs?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.094
Just a minute.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.463
Mom, kitchen!

07:43.497 --> 07:48.936
Uh, well, you boys go ahead
and talk amongst yourselves.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.138
So how are you, Mr. C?

07:51.171 --> 07:54.708
Tip-topity.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.877
What am I going to do, Mom?

07:56.910 --> 07:59.112
We've been dating
three weeks already!

07:59.146 --> 08:01.214
If he doesn't pin me
tonight, I'll die!

08:01.248 --> 08:02.683
I'll just die!

08:02.716 --> 08:03.684
[cries]

08:03.717 --> 08:07.555
Oh, there, there, Rebecca.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.657
If you don't have
a steady boyfriend,

08:09.690 --> 08:12.192
it won't be the
end of the world!

08:12.225 --> 08:13.193
It won't.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.597
I'm just kidding,
of course it will!

08:16.630 --> 08:18.465
Well, then, what
should I do, Mom?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.602
Well, actually, it's
as easy as pie, dear.

08:21.635 --> 08:25.873
If you want to trap a man, you
cannot appear to be too eager.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.142
And you must never,
never act too smart.

08:29.176 --> 08:33.547
[laughs] You know everything
about everything, Mom.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.383
Yes, I do, dear, but just
don't tell your father!

08:40.554 --> 08:44.091
The key to a good fallout
shelter is in the locks.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.660
'Cause when the big one drops
and you have to take cover,

08:46.694 --> 08:48.796
it's not the Commies
you'll be fighting off.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.998
It's your neighbors.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.701
Daddy, have you
been talking to Mark?

08:53.734 --> 08:57.170
Hey, we were just talking
about the Red Menace.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.306
Well, I'm glad I
wasn't here for that.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.574
I wouldn't have
understood a word!

09:03.944 --> 09:05.378
[laughter]

09:05.412 --> 09:06.479
We should be going.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.514
Bye-bye.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.348
Good luck!

09:15.522 --> 09:17.490
You know, honey, that
boy's starting to grow on me.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.827
He's opposed to those
who are not like us,

09:19.860 --> 09:21.929
and he's on the football team.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.864
Tip-topity!

09:23.897 --> 09:26.099
ANNOUNCER: "That's
Our Rosey" will

09:26.133 --> 09:30.938
return after this brief
commercial announcement.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.340
[coughs]

09:34.441 --> 09:36.810
[gags]

09:38.879 --> 09:41.248
Gosh, you sound awful!

09:41.281 --> 09:42.916
These darned cigarettes
tickle my throat.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.985
[coughs] Maybe I should
just quit smoking.

09:45.018 --> 09:45.886
No!

09:45.919 --> 09:47.254
Just change brands.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.656
Here, try one of mine.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.029
Say, that's rich
tobacco flavor.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.598
What brand are these?

09:58.632 --> 09:59.667
Yorke's.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.568
Their unique filter
allows you to enjoy

10:01.601 --> 10:03.403
great taste without wheezing.

10:06.907 --> 10:11.144
And look what I got
by saving the coupons.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.513
Why, it's Yorkie,
the cute little otter

10:13.546 --> 10:15.415
from the Yorke cigarette ads.

10:15.448 --> 10:19.452
Stinky, I've got a friend
here who'd like to meet you.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.287
Yorkie!

10:27.661 --> 10:28.628
BOTH: Uh-oh!

10:28.662 --> 10:30.063
The old brand's in trouble!

10:30.097 --> 10:30.964
[music playing]

10:30.998 --> 10:32.332
Yorke's the one for you!

10:38.672 --> 10:40.573
[knocks]

10:41.574 --> 10:43.243
Come in.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.645
Balancing this doggone
checkbook is as frustrating

10:45.679 --> 10:47.614
as this darn Anderson account.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.582
You haven't overspent your
allowance again, have you?

10:49.616 --> 10:52.219
Now, dear, you haven't seen
me wearing any new hats lately,

10:52.252 --> 10:53.620
have you?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.723
Not this week.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.891
Look what I've done, dear.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.860
I've cleared off
two whole shelves

10:59.893 --> 11:03.263
so that the Deej can fill them
up with his football trophies.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.165
You know, dear, I'm kind
of worried about the Deej.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.366
I, uh, think that--

11:06.399 --> 11:08.268
I mean, I don't think, I--

11:08.301 --> 11:16.276
I feel while he likes
football, he may actually

11:16.309 --> 11:18.846
like music a little better.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.313
Music?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.049
The Deej?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.683
Yes, dear,
haven't you noticed?

11:23.717 --> 11:27.220
He's got that pop beat fever.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.456
No son of mine is
going to be playing

11:29.489 --> 11:31.391
in a rock 'n' roll band.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.893
Rock 'n' roll.

11:32.926 --> 11:38.799
[laughs] The kids call it
music, but I call it noise.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.534
Look, dear, do
you really think

11:41.568 --> 11:45.973
it would hurt to let the
Deej decide this for himself?

11:46.006 --> 11:51.411
Well, no.

11:51.444 --> 11:55.048
Let's leave the Deej be and
let him make up his own mind.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.960
[sneaky music playing]

12:45.765 --> 12:47.868
You wanted to see me, dear?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.636
Rosey, you've got
some explaining to do.

12:53.974 --> 12:54.942
I'm sorry, dear.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.376
I guess sometimes
a woman's emotions

12:56.409 --> 12:58.211
just get the best of her.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.849
[laughs] Well, I forgive you.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.517
You know, I guess the Deej will
do whatever he wants to do.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.354
Kids these days
just don't listen.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.190
Well, I think I
know the Deej, dear,

13:10.223 --> 13:12.025
and he is not going
to do anything

13:12.059 --> 13:14.794
without his father's approval.

13:14.828 --> 13:15.695
OK.

13:15.728 --> 13:16.763
I'll talk to him.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.969
What is it, dear?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.403
It's just so hard being a man.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.276
You have to clean out the
gutters, balance the checkbook,

13:29.309 --> 13:32.445
solve all the kids' problems,
and still worry about

13:32.479 --> 13:34.647
that darned Anderson account.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.283
Oh, dear, don't
worry about it.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.785
I'm sure the solution to
that darned Anderson account

13:38.818 --> 13:40.387
will come to you.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.221
Aww.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.441
Deej, your father's
looking for you.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.910
He wants to talk.

14:02.943 --> 14:03.843
Go wait in the study.

14:10.050 --> 14:13.887
Uh-oh, the Deej is in trouble!

14:13.921 --> 14:16.256
[doorbell ringing]

14:19.759 --> 14:20.693
Hello, Mose.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.262
Evenin' Miss Rosey.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.865
I was here to pick up that box
of discards for the church.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.534
It's right over there.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.037
Go get it, June bug.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.505
So, Mose, how are all
the colored people doing

14:32.539 --> 14:34.107
over on your side of town?

14:34.141 --> 14:36.543
Good, everybody
working over there.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.479
Colored people's happy
when they're working.

14:39.512 --> 14:43.016
How about the lovely wife
over on this side of town?

14:43.050 --> 14:43.984
Just fine, Mose.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.052
Thank you.

14:45.085 --> 14:45.953
That's good.

14:45.986 --> 14:46.853
Well, it's late.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.188
I got to get on, now.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.156
You walk with Jesus.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.724
Oh, yes, definitely.

14:51.758 --> 14:52.625
You're so cute!

14:56.629 --> 14:59.066
Are things ever
gonna change, Pop?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.768
Oh, someday, when
one of us is president,

15:01.801 --> 15:05.005
might even be you, son.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.839
Who are they, Mom?

15:06.873 --> 15:10.477
Oh, that's just old Mose
Powell and his son Colin.

15:14.814 --> 15:15.715
Hey, toots.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.617
Jackie, where have you been?

15:17.650 --> 15:20.753
We only have 15 minutes for
our coffee clutch today,

15:20.787 --> 15:23.490
and I have to soak my hands
in this mild detergent

15:23.523 --> 15:27.260
so they'll be nice and
soft, the way Dan likes 'em.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.897
And I'm already
in his dog house.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.499
Dog house, huh?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.434
Did you ball his socks
instead folding them?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.336
Because I did that to
Fred once, and whoa!

15:40.373 --> 15:42.609
No, no, nothing like that.

15:42.642 --> 15:47.780
You see, Dan wants the Deej
to play football, and I--

15:47.814 --> 15:51.084
I-- I kind of encouraged him
to play the guitar instead.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.220
You went against Dan's wishes?

15:53.253 --> 15:57.224
Well, the Deej wants
to play guitar, Jackie.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.559
And I know because,
well, I'm the one

15:59.592 --> 16:02.229
that's home all day, every
day, from morning till night.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.063
Mm.

16:08.968 --> 16:14.641
Jackie, could you please
not be wacky for one minute?

16:14.674 --> 16:17.344
Sorry!

16:17.377 --> 16:20.447
What I'm trying to
say is, well, gosh,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.582
it seems like I do
everything for this family.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.517
And yet, Dan gets
all the credit.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.786
Well, he is the man!

16:26.819 --> 16:29.189
But I do all the laundry.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.490
I balance the checkbook.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.891
I-- I do the shopping.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.961
I take care of the kids and the
car and darn it, I'm just not--

16:34.994 --> 16:35.862
Say it Rosey.

16:35.895 --> 16:36.763
Say it!

16:36.796 --> 16:40.467
I'm not happy.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.634
That's all I needed to hear.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.849
Jackie, what are you doing?

16:56.883 --> 16:57.984
You're not alone.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.621
There are other women
who feel the way you do.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.390
They talk about changing things.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.357
Changing things?

17:04.391 --> 17:05.392
Who don't want
to take it anymore.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.459
No, stop!

17:06.493 --> 17:07.394
Who don't want to
do what their husbands

17:07.427 --> 17:09.196
say just because they say so!

17:09.229 --> 17:10.197
No more!

17:10.230 --> 17:11.198
No more!

17:11.231 --> 17:13.200
You're giving me a
pounding headache!

17:13.233 --> 17:15.535
I'm not giving you
a headache, the truth

17:15.568 --> 17:17.670
is giving you a headache!

17:17.704 --> 17:20.473
Jackie, I can't believe
this is coming from you.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.442
You are so wacky!

17:22.475 --> 17:25.978
That's my cover!

17:26.012 --> 17:28.415
A bunch of us are having
meetings once a week.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.350
We call them Tupperware parties.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.824
There's only a few of us
now, but we're growing.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.025
We're planning a revolution.

17:43.496 --> 17:47.934
Under the guise of keeping
your leftovers fresh?

17:47.967 --> 17:51.804
That's brilliant!

17:51.838 --> 17:53.140
Are you with us?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.541
Are you telling me
that if I join, I--

17:54.574 --> 17:57.277
I won't have this feeling
of hopelessness anymore?

17:57.310 --> 18:00.713
I can have some control in my
life and over my own destiny?

18:00.747 --> 18:01.614
Yes!

18:01.648 --> 18:03.116
That's the spirit, sister!

18:06.153 --> 18:08.655
Well, you're not going
to hit me, are you?

18:08.688 --> 18:09.756
No, no.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.990
This is what we all do!

18:21.201 --> 18:22.202
ANNOUNCER: Don't go away.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.637
"That's Our Rosey"
will be right back.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.310
Ho hum.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.278
[chimes]

18:31.311 --> 18:34.781
Feeling ho hum?

18:34.814 --> 18:37.217
Dr. Clean!

18:37.250 --> 18:39.819
I just don't have a lot
of energy lately, doctor.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.855
I have trouble concentrating
and a general feeling

18:42.889 --> 18:44.524
of hopelessness.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.727
And I just feel out of sorts.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.097
Well, has your
housework suffered?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.565
Not yet.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.301
But I did notice
this morning when

18:54.334 --> 18:57.904
I was ironing for the
first time, I didn't hum.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.875
I've been hearing
this a lot lately.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.812
You need Bearitall.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.146
Bearitall?

19:07.180 --> 19:11.851
Yes, many housewives find
that it soothes and restores.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.120
ANNOUNCER: Bearitall
contains alcohol and

19:14.153 --> 19:16.055
other fine distilled products.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.590
It helps them get
back to the things

19:17.624 --> 19:19.992
that matter most, like
cooking and cleaning.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.878
[chimes]

19:58.898 --> 20:00.433
OK, son, go wash up.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.068
Dad, you're the greatest!

20:02.101 --> 20:03.270
[laughs]

20:03.303 --> 20:05.171
Rosey, [claps] how
about some coffee?

20:13.313 --> 20:15.748
So how did your
talk with DJ go, dear?

20:15.782 --> 20:16.683
Swell.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.785
It turns out I was
right all along.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.353
The lad really did want
to play the guitar.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.954
Oh, that's just great.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.222
It's nothing.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.558
You should see the way I
handled that Anderson account.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.227
The boss has invited me
to his club for a steam.

20:28.261 --> 20:32.299
Oh, honey you're so smart!

20:32.332 --> 20:34.133
I love you to pieces!

20:37.103 --> 20:39.205
Hey, what do you say we push
our twin beds together tonight,

20:39.238 --> 20:40.039
and--

20:43.075 --> 20:44.043
shh!

20:44.076 --> 20:46.846
The kids will hear you.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.748
Uh-oh, Dad's in trouble!

20:52.419 --> 20:53.286
[music playing]

20:53.320 --> 20:56.756
That's our Rosey!

20:56.789 --> 20:59.659
[rock 'n' roll music playing]

21:03.229 --> 21:07.667
(SINGING) Hey, everybody
listen to what I say.

21:07.700 --> 21:11.638
I may be a kid,
but I don't play.

21:11.671 --> 21:15.107
The stuff I know they
don't teach in school.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.077
Do you know what I mean?

21:18.110 --> 21:21.548
I'm too cool for school.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.416
Cool!

21:23.450 --> 21:24.984
[screaming]

21:28.154 --> 21:30.156
And you didn't want
to buy him a guitar.

21:30.189 --> 21:31.891
[laughs]

21:33.793 --> 21:37.029
[happy music playing]
