psychologists, psychotherapists,

cognitive behavioural assessments,
and they all say he's off his lolly.

09:39.487 --> 09:43.799

All he wants is to be accepted.

10:18.927 --> 10:20.155
So why you still living with her?

10:20.207 --> 10:24.405
Because she won't move out,
and it's my dad's fucking house.

10:24.447 --> 10:26.722
She's gorgeous.

Me and you, the open road.
Nowt more romantic than a camper van.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.564
You've obviously never stayed
in a five-star hotel.

11:03.607 --> 11:06.326
lt's not exactly what l had in mind.

11:06.367 --> 11:09.165
You'll put up with anything
when the sex is fresh.

11:09.207 --> 11:12.517
Blondie! No hot water!
How do you turn the immersion on?

11:12.927 --> 11:15.395

11:15.447 --> 11:18.439
lf you'd rather stay in a B&B somewhere...

11:18.487 --> 11:20.762
No, no, it's great. Honest.

11:20.807 --> 11:24.004
Just think we might have to fumigate it first.

11:24.047 --> 11:26.641
Craig, your wife's at the front door.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.086
Oh!

You living here now, then?

11:38.207 --> 11:39.401

11:39.447 --> 11:40.926
You've not been home in over a week.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.162
- Home?
- Well, you know.

11:43.207 --> 11:46.324
Oh, my dad's house.
Place you want half of.

11:50.607 --> 11:53.644
You actually wanting something
or is this a social visit?

11:53.687 --> 11:56.440
Boiler's playing up. Place is like an icebox.

11:56.487 --> 11:59.001
You know that book with the coloured pages?

11:59.047 --> 12:01.402
And how much is that going to cost?

12:03.007 --> 12:05.202
All right, l'll sort it.

12:05.247 --> 12:10.241

lt's me, from earlier!
l didn't mean to scare you.

12:31.647 --> 12:35.879
lt's all right.
You took me by surprise, that's all.

12:35.927 --> 12:38.885
You manage to find him, your husband?

12:38.927 --> 12:40.918
Sugar lumps!

12:42.887 --> 12:45.117
Don't hide it for my benefit.

12:45.167 --> 12:47.362
Your Tourette's.

12:47.407 --> 12:51.366
Lad at our school had it,
everyone called him Fuck Off Phil.

12:51.407 --> 12:55.525
People only think it's weird
when they don't know what it is.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.646
l'd better get back.

13:00.527 --> 13:02.802

13:02.847 --> 13:06.999
He must be, to let someone
like you slip through his fingers.

13:09.847 --> 13:11.917
Marty, wasn't it?

13:11.967 --> 13:13.958
Horse sex!

13:16.807 --> 13:20.038
l can't believe you're
bringing your own fire wood!

13:20.087 --> 13:22.396
Camping trip needs a camp fire.

13:22.447 --> 13:26.838
When l was a kid, l used to set fire
to my sister's dolls when she annoyed me.

13:26.887 --> 13:28.286
Hiya!

13:31.447 --> 13:32.721
You're taking the piss.

13:32.767 --> 13:36.521
Before you get your knickers in a twist,
l'm not here for you.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.319
They're going on a date.

13:38.367 --> 13:40.119
Who's going on a date?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.759
Ta-da!

13:41.807 --> 13:43.957
Look at this handsome devil!

13:44.007 --> 13:46.043
< You're like a young Bruce Willis.

13:46.087 --> 13:48.999
Long time since l've been courted.

13:49.047 --> 13:52.244
Take my advice, Fiona.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

13:54.527 --> 13:55.846
Right, what's the game?

13:55.887 --> 13:59.880
Game? l'm going on a date.
Didn't know there were a law against it.

13:59.927 --> 14:03.203
Convenient - bagging a bloke
who lives in the same house.

14:03.247 --> 14:05.283
What difference does it make?

14:05.327 --> 14:09.286
Anyone'd think you still had feelings for me.

14:09.327 --> 14:11.841
Shall we? See ya, Debbie.

14:11.887 --> 14:13.240
< See ya.

14:15.247 --> 14:17.283
Don't wait up!

14:18.487 --> 14:21.479
Having a girlfriend's got to
be good for his court case.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.083
l'm going chestnut brown.

14:29.127 --> 14:31.357
New life, new look, that's my motto.

14:31.407 --> 14:33.204
lt looks like a bleedin' protest.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.080
You ever thought of changing colour?

14:36.127 --> 14:37.765
Bit '80s, that look, isn't it?

14:37.807 --> 14:39.126
ls it?

14:39.167 --> 14:41.635
Sharon Stone, Madonna.
They were all at it then, but...

14:41.687 --> 14:45.043
- l think your bloke's hanging about outside.
- You're joking.

14:45.087 --> 14:46.964
Tall, skinny, a bit lggy Pop.

14:47.007 --> 14:52.320
For God's sake, don't let him in!
lf he's not had a fix, he gets violent.

14:52.367 --> 14:56.724
Marie! l know you're in there, come on down!

14:56.767 --> 15:01.318
l've gotta be at work in ten minutes.
l'll shoot out the front.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.846
l'm coming with ya.

15:02.887 --> 15:04.639
You're not leaving me with him!

15:04.687 --> 15:06.564
CLATTERlNG

15:08.847 --> 15:09.802
lt's your shot.

15:09.847 --> 15:11.883
Which one am l going for?

15:11.927 --> 15:15.761
Go for that red one into the
bottom corner. lt should go in, that.

15:15.807 --> 15:18.799
But if you lean over and get right on the cue,

15:21.567 --> 15:24.127
Get it just between your fingers there.

15:24.167 --> 15:26.920
lt'll go in there.

15:28.807 --> 15:30.206
Oh, l think l've had too much wine!

15:30.247 --> 15:33.239
Rubbish. More you drink,
better you get at this game. Shut it!

15:34.967 --> 15:38.164
MACHlNE'S WlNNlNG JlNGLE
Jackpot!

15:41.927 --> 15:44.566
And it had a little wind chime.

15:44.607 --> 15:46.325
Twisted freak.

15:46.367 --> 15:50.246
How can sticking a needle
in your arm be normal?

15:50.287 --> 15:52.926
Tell me, who sees that as normal?

15:52.967 --> 15:54.195
l know, but...

15:54.247 --> 15:57.125
love's blind, Frank.

15:57.167 --> 15:58.395
Look at Kev with Veronica.

15:58.447 --> 16:00.677
You're not telling me he couldn't do better.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.525
A word from the wise. Get your stuff out,

16:03.567 --> 16:09.483
otherwise he'll have your stereo in his veins
before you can say, Dolby Surround Sound.

16:09.527 --> 16:11.757
All right, Frank. We're dealing with it.

16:11.807 --> 16:12.842
Yes, but when?

16:12.887 --> 16:16.197
Druggie, Kev. We're talking desperation,

16:16.247 --> 16:18.203
we're talking scum of the earth.

16:18.247 --> 16:22.320
No, thing is, l can't. l ain't got a van or anything.

16:22.367 --> 16:24.835
Wait, no problem. Eamonn!

16:24.887 --> 16:27.276
Eamonn! How do you fancy

16:27.327 --> 16:30.558
being this lady's knight in shining armour?

16:30.607 --> 16:33.679
Depends. ls there a pint in it for me?

16:33.727 --> 16:36.958
Spunk face, bucket of spunk,
what else do you do?

16:37.007 --> 16:38.486
Piss flaps.

16:38.527 --> 16:41.280
Donkey dick... Donkey dick!

16:41.327 --> 16:43.158
Come on.

16:43.207 --> 16:45.163
l want to show you something.

16:45.927 --> 16:49.078
Bucket!
SHE LAUGHS

16:52.527 --> 16:53.960
You ready?

16:54.007 --> 16:55.076
Yeah.

16:55.127 --> 16:58.005
Three, two, one.

17:01.247 --> 17:03.681
What am l looking at?

17:03.727 --> 17:06.400
The most beautiful place in the world.

17:07.967 --> 17:09.445
What, that?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.318
To other people,

17:11.367 --> 17:13.756
it's just a gas tower,

17:13.807 --> 17:16.116
but to me, it's...awesome.

17:18.446 --> 17:20.881
Beauty's everywhere.

17:20.926 --> 17:23.521
Just depends whether
you choose to see it.

17:29.047 --> 17:31.720
Boner! Sorry, sorry.

17:31.767 --> 17:33.598
Don't apologise.

17:33.647 --> 17:35.717
That's what makes you who you are.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.605
Craig must be off his head.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.635
How can he live without that?

17:55.927 --> 17:57.918
Let's go back to yours.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.322
Er...what's all this?!

18:07.367 --> 18:09.676
A few home comforts.

18:09.727 --> 18:12.446
Sneaked in while Jack were out.

18:12.487 --> 18:14.717
Don't look at me, it were Frank's idea.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.837
Figures, might've known
you'd stick your nose in!

18:16.887 --> 18:20.277
Goodness of me heart!
Rescue mission, damsel in distress!

18:20.327 --> 18:23.205
You'll stay for a smoke, won't you? Few drinks?

18:23.247 --> 18:25.442
Top, yeah.

18:25.487 --> 18:28.524
Don't mind, do ya? Blondie?

18:30.567 --> 18:32.683
Time's up, Kev.

18:35.567 --> 18:37.842
For fuck's sake!

18:37.887 --> 18:41.641
(Frank) Down from that castle, Rapunzel.
Let down your golden hair.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.281
< GlGGLlNG

18:45.687 --> 18:47.166
Ow!

18:47.207 --> 18:48.242
Toss!

18:48.287 --> 18:50.403
GlGGLlNG

18:50.447 --> 18:51.926
Oh!

18:56.327 --> 18:58.966
GlGGLlNG

19:04.327 --> 19:05.885
Suck me cock!

19:05.927 --> 19:07.440
Sorry.

19:07.487 --> 19:12.925
Craig, maybe you've got it wrong,
maybe she really likes him!

19:12.967 --> 19:16.323
l know he's got his problems,
but he's a good-looking bloke.

19:16.367 --> 19:20.121
l've known her a lot longer than you,
and she's sticking the knife in.

19:20.167 --> 19:21.600
By pulling Marty?

19:23.807 --> 19:25.559
Kinky boots!

19:26.607 --> 19:29.599
Just her presence in this house,
it's like poison.

19:29.647 --> 19:32.480
Let her shag him!
Let her scream the house down!

19:32.527 --> 19:34.119
Why should you care?

19:36.287 --> 19:37.925
See?

19:37.967 --> 19:39.958
This is exactly what she wants.

19:49.487 --> 19:52.604
l can't get me... Get your top off.

19:52.647 --> 19:53.636
What?!

19:53.687 --> 19:56.520
l can't do this.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.363
My head's all over the place.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.602
We can wait. We don't have to rush it.

20:02.647 --> 20:04.126
lt isn't that. lt's just...

20:08.567 --> 20:12.242
l like you, and l've had a great time, but...

20:12.287 --> 20:13.959
it's Craig.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.475
What about him?

20:16.527 --> 20:19.439
- He's still my husband, Marty.
- l thought it were all over.

20:19.487 --> 20:22.285
We've been married eight years.

20:22.327 --> 20:27.685
lt's comfort more than passion,
but you can't just turn it off.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.356
lt's all such a mess.

20:42.687 --> 20:44.917
You still shagging him?

20:46.927 --> 20:48.679
You mustn't tell Fiona.

20:48.727 --> 20:51.161
Promise me, you won't tell Fiona.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.758
Marty! No!

21:00.807 --> 21:02.684
Do you want her or not?

21:02.727 --> 21:06.003
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Him! Fucking Casanova!

21:06.047 --> 21:08.242
Stringing you both along,
wanting it every which way!

21:08.287 --> 21:10.243
- What have you told him?
- Nothing!

21:10.287 --> 21:11.276
She told me the truth.

21:11.327 --> 21:12.237
What fucking truth?

21:12.287 --> 21:14.278
About him and her.

21:15.487 --> 21:18.445
He's still shagging her.
Even though he don't even want her.

21:18.487 --> 21:19.522
You lying...

21:19.567 --> 21:22.877
Stay away from her,
l'll break both your fucking legs!

21:22.927 --> 21:27.125
Fiona, he's messing you around,
he's messing everyone around.

21:27.167 --> 21:32.002
lt's not fair, cos l could make her
happy, and he don't even love her.

21:34.607 --> 21:36.677
When did you last sleep with him?

21:36.727 --> 21:37.523
Fiona!

21:37.567 --> 21:41.401
We're having this out.
Tell me, when did you last sleep with him?

21:41.447 --> 21:45.838
- l'm not looking to hurt you.
- When did you last sleep with him?

21:45.887 --> 21:48.355
Last week, last month, last year?

21:48.407 --> 21:50.602
She's telling the truth!

21:50.647 --> 21:53.684
Marty, open your eyes.
She's trying to break us up.

21:53.727 --> 21:55.524
She's fucking using ya.

21:55.567 --> 21:58.400
She's not. She wouldn't.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.721
We've kissed.

22:02.407 --> 22:05.877
Do you think somebody like her
would be interested in a freak like you?

22:05.927 --> 22:06.882
< Craig!

22:06.927 --> 22:10.158
She is! Tell him!
Tell him how you feel about me!

22:17.127 --> 22:18.719
Oh, shit! >

22:18.767 --> 22:20.598
< Jesus, the baby!

22:21.647 --> 22:24.207
- Baby?!
- l'll go and get an ambulance.

22:24.247 --> 22:27.319
l knew it. You're going to leave me, aren't you?

22:30.087 --> 22:31.884
lt's like bedlam out here!

22:31.927 --> 22:33.042
Wait!

22:33.087 --> 22:34.486
What's all the racket?

22:34.527 --> 22:36.836
lt's nothing. lt's OK.

22:36.887 --> 22:40.163
Tell Craig forget about the ambulance.

22:40.207 --> 22:42.641
Leave me alone!

22:42.687 --> 22:44.166
Please, come back.

22:46.287 --> 22:48.243
Marty, look.

22:48.287 --> 22:50.755
SOBBlNG

22:58.807 --> 23:00.399
Prick!

23:14.127 --> 23:16.118
Spunk face!

23:37.087 --> 23:39.601
We've got a little world of our own

23:39.647 --> 23:41.717
l'll tell you things that no-one else knows

23:41.767 --> 23:44.281
l'll let you in when no-one else goes

23:44.327 --> 23:47.160
We've got to do it without you

23:47.207 --> 23:51.997
l'll tell you things that no-one else knows,
l'll let you in when no-one else goes

23:52.047 --> 23:54.117
We've got to do it without you...

23:58.727 --> 24:00.240
Oh, no.

24:12.847 --> 24:16.556
- l'm only helping cos we wanna get rid of it.
- Fiona!

24:17.607 --> 24:19.757
He's torn his mantra!

24:19.807 --> 24:21.957
He's in court on Monday!

24:22.007 --> 24:25.841
l'm going on holiday,
what do you want me to do about it?

24:25.887 --> 24:27.206
< What's up with your sulky chops?

24:27.247 --> 24:28.475
l'm moving out.

24:28.527 --> 24:31.678
l'm not stepping foot in that house
until my idiot husband gets rid of

24:31.727 --> 24:33.524
that STUPlD BlTCH!

24:33.567 --> 24:36.286
The house is covered in tat.

24:36.327 --> 24:38.841
Can l stay at yours, Fiona?

24:38.887 --> 24:40.798
You can have my room till l get back.

24:40.847 --> 24:41.996
Who's your mate?

24:42.047 --> 24:44.766
Alfred. He's the only bloke l can rely on.

24:44.807 --> 24:47.275
Ahh!

24:47.327 --> 24:49.966
(All) Bye!

24:56.847 --> 24:58.519
- For fuck's sake!
- Craig, don't!

24:58.567 --> 25:02.116
What is it with you, eh? Don't you
think you've caused enough damage?

25:02.167 --> 25:05.045
Go home,
because l'm going on holiday with Fiona

25:05.087 --> 25:07.123
and there's nothing you can say to alter that.

25:07.167 --> 25:08.885
Craig.

25:11.007 --> 25:12.599
Your dad's dead.

25:29.767 --> 25:31.325
Ta.

25:33.767 --> 25:36.361
Three years he's been in that home.

25:36.407 --> 25:39.046
Hanging on and hanging on.

25:39.087 --> 25:41.203
Trust him to pick this week to go.

25:42.767 --> 25:45.600
My dad died the day l passed my driving test.

25:45.647 --> 25:48.764
Still, meant l got his Citroen!

25:54.887 --> 25:56.605
Were you close?

25:56.647 --> 25:58.717
Used to be.

25:58.767 --> 26:01.281
Best mates.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.636
But then his head went west.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.962
Dementia.

26:06.007 --> 26:09.682
Last few months he started calling me Rupert.

26:11.847 --> 26:15.806
lt's a terrible thing, losing your father.

26:17.527 --> 26:19.324
Grandad's still alive!

26:19.367 --> 26:25.044
l know, l'm just saying, it's a
terrible thing losing your father.

26:25.087 --> 26:27.442
Marty's tablets.

26:27.487 --> 26:29.364
For his hypermania.

26:29.407 --> 26:31.318
He needs to take two twice a day.

26:31.367 --> 26:34.643
Does no-one care?

26:37.927 --> 26:40.725
Still, there's an upside.

26:40.767 --> 26:45.443
House is mine now, innit?
So once l flog that off, no more Sue.

26:55.927 --> 26:59.442
l feel like l don't even know him.
l've got his baby inside me,

26:59.487 --> 27:02.923
and it's like there's this whole other world -

27:02.967 --> 27:04.958
wife, dad...

27:05.007 --> 27:06.804
that l've never even been a part of.

27:06.847 --> 27:08.838
Give it chance.

27:08.887 --> 27:10.320
lt takes time.

27:10.367 --> 27:14.519
l know! That's the one thing we haven't got.

27:14.567 --> 27:18.116
l just wish we'd had a bit more time
before all this had happened.

27:29.927 --> 27:31.201
Cool.

27:34.247 --> 27:36.886
Sorry, Fiona, l've got to go to mine.

28:07.767 --> 28:09.485
RUNNlNG WATER

28:18.127 --> 28:20.595
- Show me your arms!
- You mad bitch!

28:20.647 --> 28:23.081
Show me your arms, you druggie cow!

28:23.127 --> 28:25.163
Get off me! Get off me!

28:31.167 --> 28:32.646
(Oh, yes.)

28:37.847 --> 28:39.041
(Fiona) How did it go with the undertaker?

28:39.087 --> 28:44.878
Sister's shafted me. She'd arranged
a burial when he wanted a cremation.

28:44.927 --> 28:49.239
We stayed up one night, talking,
he told me exactly what he wanted -

28:49.287 --> 28:51.357
a big party with people enjoying themselves,

28:51.407 --> 28:54.524
not me and my sister stood round the coffin
looking fuckin' mournful.

29:05.087 --> 29:06.486
Guess where they've come from.

29:06.527 --> 29:07.676
A diabetic.

29:07.727 --> 29:09.365
Kelly Marie's bag.

29:09.407 --> 29:12.240
They probably belong to dog boy -
Jack Russell.

29:12.287 --> 29:16.565
l've just seen her scoring.
Tenner says that's why he kicked her out.

29:16.607 --> 29:20.441
You can accuse our Kel of a lot
of things, but she's not a junkie!

29:20.487 --> 29:23.001
She's wafer thin, always skint,

29:23.047 --> 29:25.356
and when was the last time
she wore a sleeveless top?

29:25.407 --> 29:28.956
l know you don't like her,
but that's my little sister

29:29.007 --> 29:31.760
and she's not into fuckin' skag!

29:31.807 --> 29:34.241
We'll see about that.

29:35.447 --> 29:37.802
Oi, what are you on about?

29:37.847 --> 29:39.599
She's going cold turkey.

29:50.807 --> 29:52.320
Open the fucking door!

29:54.087 --> 29:56.681
Stupid blonde bitch!

29:58.807 --> 30:01.640
Can you fuckin' hear me?

30:05.967 --> 30:09.243
(Crowd chants) Jump! Jump! Jump!

30:19.607 --> 30:22.804
CHlLDREN LAUGH
GUlTAR STRUMS

30:22.847 --> 30:25.122
Give us a beer, love.

30:25.167 --> 30:27.442
D'you want a beer, Craig?

30:27.487 --> 30:30.843
You can have a beer,
but you don't normally.

30:30.887 --> 30:33.401
Yeah, like l can never have a drink!

30:37.967 --> 30:40.527
We should get Carol playing the guitar! >

30:40.567 --> 30:44.799
Quick, it's Marty! He's gonna
chuck himself off Sandringham House!

30:58.127 --> 30:59.606
Marty!

31:02.887 --> 31:05.037
No, Debbie! Debbie, no!

31:05.087 --> 31:06.839
l'm going up!

31:07.927 --> 31:09.918
- Get off us!
- Let us past!

31:22.007 --> 31:23.122
STAY BACK!

31:23.167 --> 31:25.681
Marty, come away from the edge.

31:35.287 --> 31:36.197
What's up?

31:36.247 --> 31:38.681
l'm scared of heights.

31:38.727 --> 31:40.285
Let me do the talking.

31:40.327 --> 31:42.318
GET BACK!

31:45.687 --> 31:48.406
Them people down there -

31:48.447 --> 31:51.996
they'd love to see you try and fly.

31:52.047 --> 31:55.676
You'd be the talk of the town
for about half an hour.

31:55.727 --> 31:57.877
Don't you think your life's
worth more than that?

31:57.927 --> 31:59.599
Cornflakes!

31:59.647 --> 32:03.526
l just want to be like everybody else!

32:04.807 --> 32:07.719
Cos that fucker's right! l'm a freak!

32:07.767 --> 32:10.122
Do you know how that feels? Do ya?

32:13.047 --> 32:16.403
Yeah, look at ya. Yeah, come on!

32:16.447 --> 32:18.483
Human misery.

32:18.527 --> 32:20.245
You can't get enough of it!

32:20.287 --> 32:22.403
Eh? Willing a bloke

32:22.447 --> 32:24.403
to chuck himself to his death

32:24.447 --> 32:28.406
so that you can have a bit
of fuckin' entertainment.

32:29.767 --> 32:33.601
Serves you right if he lands on
your heads, you brainless cunts.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.207
Yeah, jump, yeah, jump, come on!

32:37.767 --> 32:39.120
Just...

32:39.167 --> 32:41.158
stay away, Debs.

32:41.207 --> 32:42.845
l mean it.

32:44.407 --> 32:46.045
No.

32:46.087 --> 32:50.797
Because if you're going, Marty,
l want you to know three things.

32:50.847 --> 32:55.125
And you're not jumping off this
building until you've heard them.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.163
We all love ya.

32:58.207 --> 32:59.686
Fuck!

33:01.447 --> 33:05.281
You're not a freak. You've got Tourette's.

33:05.327 --> 33:09.206
Craig is really upset that
he called you that. Aren't ya?

33:13.567 --> 33:16.445
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to Sue.

33:16.487 --> 33:19.206
She just doesn't know it yet.

33:24.167 --> 33:25.919
Debbie's right, Marty.

33:25.967 --> 33:28.276
She just needs someone to love her.

33:29.847 --> 33:33.681
She's an unhappy person,
but she weren't always like that.

33:33.727 --> 33:35.445
She's got a good heart.

33:37.927 --> 33:39.565
She'd be lucky to have you.

33:51.607 --> 33:54.075
l don't want to go back to prison.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.275
(Veronica) Nice one, Debbie!

34:09.327 --> 34:11.237
Show's over.

34:11.286 --> 34:14.882
Yeah, go on, fuck off,
you bunch of freaks! Tossers!

34:31.127 --> 34:33.766
He was a great bloke, Fiona.

34:33.806 --> 34:35.763
He was always there for me.

34:37.327 --> 34:38.806
Whatever.

34:46.967 --> 34:51.324
lf l can do half as well with
our kid as he did with me, then...

34:53.447 --> 34:56.007
..l reckon l'll be all right.

35:05.807 --> 35:09.595
l'm a good human being
(with a great deal to offer.)

35:09.647 --> 35:10.966
(l'm a good human being...)

35:11.007 --> 35:12.042
KNOCK ON DOOR

35:12.087 --> 35:13.645
Yeah?

35:16.407 --> 35:18.682
Big day tomorrow, Marty.

35:18.727 --> 35:22.879
Yeah, l'm just trying it on,
so l've got everything perfect.

35:22.927 --> 35:25.487
Make sure you get a good night's sleep.

35:25.527 --> 35:27.643
You want to be fresh in court.

35:34.647 --> 35:37.844
l'm a good human being

35:37.887 --> 35:40.481
with a great deal to offer.

35:40.527 --> 35:42.006
l'm a good human being...

36:05.207 --> 36:08.119
l'm sorry, l never meant to hurt you.

36:10.407 --> 36:12.762
TO Y SQUEAKS REPEATEDLY

36:23.327 --> 36:25.522
l don't know what l'm doing!

36:25.567 --> 36:26.716
Sorry.

36:26.767 --> 36:29.759
lt's all right.

36:33.207 --> 36:35.198
Puppies.

36:46.887 --> 36:48.878
TO Y SQUEAKS

36:54.287 --> 36:58.644
Let me out, you fucking bastards!

36:58.687 --> 37:01.076
Veronica, l need a shit.

37:01.127 --> 37:02.799
Go next door.

37:02.847 --> 37:06.044
You can't keep her in there forever,
she'll starve to death!

37:06.087 --> 37:08.885
She can come out
when she admits what she is.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.918
A dirty addict!

37:12.967 --> 37:14.685
SHE SCREAMS

37:18.527 --> 37:21.564
Oh, shut your fucking whining!

38:00.287 --> 38:02.084
(Fucking hell.)

38:03.687 --> 38:05.405
How are you feeling?

38:05.447 --> 38:07.915
Go fuck yourself.

38:07.967 --> 38:10.083
Tools of the trade.

38:10.127 --> 38:12.641
Only one thing missing.

38:12.687 --> 38:14.518
Not that you'll be wanting it.

38:16.407 --> 38:17.635
Kel!

38:18.687 --> 38:21.326
Fuck's sake, Kel.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.562
Got to get you some help.

38:26.647 --> 38:28.319
A bag'd be a start.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.676
(Kev) Careful with that, though, Kel.

38:53.727 --> 38:56.844
We use that on the curries. lt's red hot.

39:08.487 --> 39:09.636
Take me home.

39:09.687 --> 39:11.803
(Veronica) l'll call the doctor.

39:14.407 --> 39:16.398
SHE WHlNES

39:17.927 --> 39:22.443
l can't believe he's gone AWOL again.
What is the matter with him?

39:22.487 --> 39:25.923
Don't look at me! They all blame the mothers.

39:25.967 --> 39:31.325
l have done my best, Fiona.
God knows l have tried my best.

39:31.367 --> 39:33.358
You'll see when you have your own.

39:35.047 --> 39:37.038
What's happening, where's Marty?

39:38.727 --> 39:41.366
Why would he do this to me?

39:41.407 --> 39:43.284
What if he sneaked out early?

39:43.327 --> 39:46.399
He might've needed some time
to himself, get his head clear.

39:46.447 --> 39:50.201
lan's right, he might've
just gone to court by himself.

39:50.247 --> 39:53.045
At least if we're there
we might be able to stall things.

39:53.087 --> 39:55.237
There's no point sitting round here.

39:55.287 --> 39:58.802
Hang on, hadn't someone
better wait here just in case?

39:58.847 --> 39:59.836
l'll wait.

39:59.887 --> 40:02.401
Don't you want to go to court
in case he shows up?

40:02.447 --> 40:04.199
l've tried my best.

40:04.247 --> 40:05.726
DOOR SLAMS

40:07.367 --> 40:08.766
What are you doing here?

40:08.807 --> 40:10.445
Come to pay my respects.

40:10.487 --> 40:13.718
Yeah. Someone mentioned the free bar.

40:34.287 --> 40:35.356
lt's freezing in here!

40:35.407 --> 40:37.841
Boiler's bust.

40:37.887 --> 40:40.799
Just have to keep each other warm, then.

40:48.847 --> 40:51.839
l wish we could stay here all day.
Cunnilingus!

40:53.447 --> 40:54.926
We can.

40:54.967 --> 40:56.844
Well, till the funeral, but...

40:56.887 --> 40:59.082
that gives us...

40:59.127 --> 41:00.606
four hours.

41:02.407 --> 41:04.398
SHE GlGGLES

41:16.567 --> 41:19.957
lf he's not gonna show, we should go
to yours and get the ale flowing!

41:20.007 --> 41:21.645
Frank!

41:21.687 --> 41:24.645
Solicitor says he can't stall it any longer.

41:24.687 --> 41:28.123
lf he's not here in two minutes,
they'll file it as a no-show.

41:28.167 --> 41:30.317
They'll put him away.

41:30.367 --> 41:35.122
All that bleedin' effort and
they're just gonna put him inside.

41:35.167 --> 41:37.158
SHE SCREAMS

41:49.047 --> 41:51.117
Oh, God, Marty.

41:52.167 --> 41:56.683
Last time l've come like that,
it's been battery-operated.

42:05.607 --> 42:07.757
What you doing tomorrow night?

42:09.167 --> 42:10.919
'No!'

42:10.967 --> 42:12.366
Eh, come here.

42:12.407 --> 42:13.999
He's here!

Where've you been, spudhead?

42:25.207 --> 42:26.879
Overslept, that's all.

42:26.927 --> 42:31.079
Court two. Your solicitor's name is
Tom Vickers, you've got 30 seconds.

42:31.127 --> 42:32.321

42:47.487 --> 42:49.045
Craig! >

43:07.687 --> 43:10.076

43:12.327 --> 43:14.283
Here's to a good man.

43:14.327 --> 43:17.046
He deserves kind words today.

43:18.607 --> 43:20.598
And eternal happiness.

43:21.687 --> 43:23.757
To Marty's freedom!

There you are, Marty, mate.

43:39.047 --> 43:42.881
Look at her face. Serves her right
for stitching me dad up.

43:42.927 --> 43:47.045
He just wanted a cremation.
Promised to sprinkle him on the County pitch.

43:47.087 --> 43:48.440
Burial?

43:48.487 --> 43:50.842
He was fucking claustrophobic.

44:05.327 --> 44:07.318
Ladies and gentlemen, >

44:07.367 --> 44:12.043

45:11.927 --> 45:15.124
Everyone should go the way they wanna go.

45:20.647 --> 45:22.797
HE LAUGHS

45:26.087 --> 45:28.442
An hour out of court and you're pulling this?

45:28.487 --> 45:31.797
His dad wanted a cremation!

45:31.847 --> 45:33.724
Get hold of that, our Trace!
