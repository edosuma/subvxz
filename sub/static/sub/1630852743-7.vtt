<i>[narrator] Previously on
Worst Cooks in America...</i>

00:02.370 --> 00:03.900
Yippee ki-yay.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.200
[Anne] We're heading
into the Wild Wild West.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.200
Ride it, cowboy!

00:08.200 --> 00:11.240
<i>[Cliff] Anne and I are each gonna
show you how to make Eggs Benedict.</i>

00:11.240 --> 00:12.870
- Ha-ha.
- [Cliff] Start all over again.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.040
- This is scrambled egg.
- Oy-ay-ay. [laughs]

00:15.040 --> 00:16.310
Chile relleno.

00:16.310 --> 00:18.950
I don't like this.
Eewy!

00:18.950 --> 00:20.450
Al, [indistinct]
looking a little dark.

00:20.450 --> 00:21.920
Oh, my God!

00:21.920 --> 00:23.920
[Cliff] Bianca,
you've got to move faster.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.120
Faster, faster.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.920
The recruit who will
not be continuing on...

00:26.920 --> 00:28.160
Bianca.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.260
[Anne] Al, I'm gonna have
to ask you for your apron.

00:30.260 --> 00:32.890
<i>[narrator] You're about
to enter another dimension,</i>

00:32.900 --> 00:38.800
<i>a dimension of time and space, a dimension
of overcooked meat and bad knife cuts.</i>

00:38.800 --> 00:42.140
<i>You've crossed over
into the bad food zone.</i>

00:42.140 --> 00:44.240
<i>- Picture if you will.
- Oh, that's the fire.</i>

00:44.240 --> 00:46.040
All of it,
it just disintegrated.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.370
<i>[narrator] Two master chefs.</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:50.310
This is not what I thought.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.250
<i>[narrator] Anne Burrell...</i>

00:51.250 --> 00:52.510
[grunts]

00:52.920 --> 00:55.380
<i>[narrator] ...and newcomer,
Chef Cliff Crooks as himself.</i>

00:55.380 --> 00:57.320
Feel like I'm living my
worst nightmare right now.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.990
Oh, damn it!
It's still on.

00:58.990 --> 01:02.890
<i>[narrator] Who must transform
these poor souls from TV dinners...</i>

01:02.890 --> 01:04.830
[Anne] Are you stirring
with a fork?

01:04.830 --> 01:06.090
-No.
-[narrator] <i>...to kitchen dinners.</i>

01:06.100 --> 01:07.960
- [shrieks]
- This is delicious.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.260
<i>[narrator] Some are
total strangers...</i>

01:09.270 --> 01:10.230
Hop, hop, hop, hop.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.370
[indistinct] no shame.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.830
<i>[narrator] ...others,
old friends.</i>

01:12.840 --> 01:14.230
No, no, no.
It's that one up there.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.410
<i>[narrator] But only one person
will escape with $25,000.</i>

01:18.410 --> 01:19.310
[all cheering]

01:19.310 --> 01:21.280
I'm living my dream.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.040
[narrator]
<i>A culinary nightmare so bad...</i>

01:23.050 --> 01:25.410
-Put the water in. Water, water, water.
-[shrieking]

01:25.410 --> 01:27.950
<i>[narrator] ...I can't even do
this impression anymore.</i>

01:27.950 --> 01:30.080
Ew!
Salmonella everywhere.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.720
[Anne] I am having
a heart attack.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.190
<i>- [narrator] Next up...
- I'm a goblin.</i>

01:34.190 --> 01:38.090
[narrator] Worst Cooks In
America, The Disaster Zone.

01:39.930 --> 01:40.930
[gasps]

01:40.930 --> 01:42.260
Good morning.

01:42.260 --> 01:43.460
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.900
[Anne] Good morning, recruits.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.100
And welcome back to Boot Camp.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.940
Anne and I are so
proud of all the progress

01:49.940 --> 01:52.040
you've made in this kitchen
over the past six weeks.

01:52.040 --> 01:56.340
[Anne] And you managed to do
all of those things under our watch.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.850
Uh-oh!

01:57.850 --> 02:00.350
[Cliff] Let's see how you do
when you're in charge.

02:00.350 --> 02:02.220
[all laughing]

02:02.220 --> 02:04.050
Excuse me?

02:04.050 --> 02:09.260
[Anne] For today's skill drill, we
are playing a Worst Cooks' classic

02:09.260 --> 02:11.060
Remote Control Chef.

02:11.060 --> 02:13.090
[all cheering]

02:13.100 --> 02:15.230
[Kara] I've seen every season
of Worst Cooks,

02:15.230 --> 02:16.960
and I know exactly what this is.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.500
I love Remote Control Chef.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.870
It looks so fun.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.200
This is my favorite.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.570
Each team will be presented
with an identical mystery dish.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.940
As a team, you must determine
the ingredients,

02:27.940 --> 02:31.950
as well as the cooking method by
examining and tasting the dishes yourself.

02:31.950 --> 02:33.580
Okay.

02:33.580 --> 02:36.850
Then you must describe the dish
for both of us to replicate exactly.

02:36.850 --> 02:38.020
Oh...

02:38.020 --> 02:43.120
Cliff and I will not be able
to see or taste the dish.

02:43.130 --> 02:47.290
Whichever team's dish is
closest to the original will win.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.930
We have 30 minutes,
and our time starts now!

02:50.930 --> 02:52.030
- [all shrieking]
- Go.

02:52.030 --> 02:53.300
[Cliff] All right.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.270
[Cheyenne] Okay, it's a
mashed potato steak meal.

02:55.270 --> 02:56.400
[buzzer rings]

02:56.410 --> 02:57.440
[Cliff] What kind of steak?

02:57.440 --> 02:58.640
- With--
- Collard greens?

02:58.640 --> 03:00.870
- Stop.
- It's cooked very rare.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.010
[Cliff] Stop, stop!

03:02.010 --> 03:03.680
Did someone else taste
the mashed potatoes yet?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.350
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait...

03:05.350 --> 03:07.920
Stop, stop.
Yeah, hold on one second.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.980
- What is this meat?
- [Anne] What is the meat?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.150
Beef.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.420
What kind is it?

03:12.420 --> 03:18.030
It's red, it's tender,
it's juicy... meat.

03:18.030 --> 03:20.430
[Anne] Is it like a
strip steak or a ribeye?

03:20.430 --> 03:22.100
[Hilda]
It has grill marks on it.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.260
[Anne] What is the meat?

03:23.270 --> 03:24.670
[Hilda] I don't know, Chef Anne.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.670
Pick a beef.
Pick any beef.

03:26.670 --> 03:29.100
[Anne] All right. Is it a
thick steak or a thin steak?

03:29.100 --> 03:30.970
They all taste
the same, don't they?

03:30.970 --> 03:32.510
It's about an inch thick.

03:32.510 --> 03:33.840
[Kara] Well, yeah.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.840
All right.
Now what kind of steak?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.080
What does it look like?

03:37.080 --> 03:40.050
So we look at the steak,
immediately we could tell...

03:41.650 --> 03:43.250
We definitely know it's a steak.

03:43.250 --> 03:46.920
- The steak look like
rectangular, sliced-- - It's seared.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.460
But we don't know
if it's prime rib, ribeye.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.260
<i>[Peachez] Is it a T-bone?</i>

03:52.260 --> 03:54.700
Is it a sirloin?
Is it a skirt steak?

03:57.770 --> 04:00.130
I don't know.
How am I supposed to know?

04:00.140 --> 04:02.640
Is it, is it lean or is it
a fatty piece of beef?

04:02.640 --> 04:04.100
It is a lean fat.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.910
[Eddie speaking]

04:05.910 --> 04:07.810
We don't know if it has
a lot of fat or a little fat.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.940
Stop, wait.
Lean or fatty?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.280
All right, we'll say lean piece.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.410
Is it a New York strip or...

04:13.420 --> 04:15.880
- I feel confident.
- [Eddie] That we could use a New York strip?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.220
Sure. Yes.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.950
- Yes. Let's do a New York strip.
- [Cliff] Okay.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.820
Yes.
Let's just move on.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.790
It's definitely
a New York strip.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.860
Tell me everything
that's on the plate.

04:24.860 --> 04:28.030
Next to the steak
there's a big white lump.

04:28.030 --> 04:30.030
We've got mashed potatoes.

04:30.030 --> 04:32.070
- [Anne] Mashed potatoes.
- [Hilda] Mm-hmm.

04:32.070 --> 04:35.300
All right, this is like some mashed
potato thing, but it's not potatoes.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.370
Is it grits?
It's yellow.

04:37.370 --> 04:39.010
I know it's yellow.

04:39.010 --> 04:41.240
I think mashed potatoes.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.510
It's not mashed potatoes.

04:42.510 --> 04:43.780
No, these aren't potatoes.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.110
It is gritty.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.980
[Anne] Is it polenta?
Grits maybe?

04:47.980 --> 04:49.020
It's grits.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.150
What else would it be?

04:50.150 --> 04:52.220
If it's gritty,
it's probably grits.

04:52.220 --> 04:53.850
Not mashed potatoes.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.160
Okay.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.790
Now, let's talk about the
garnishes that are on the plate.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.660
- What else do we have?
- Um, we've got mashed potatoes.

04:58.660 --> 05:00.990
Are the potatoes yellow? Is it,
is it a yellowish mashed potato?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.130
- [Cheyenne] They are yellowy.
- [Eddie] Yes.

05:02.130 --> 05:03.300
[Cliff] Okay.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.330
We all take a bite
and quickly realize...

05:05.330 --> 05:06.270
- Is that potato?
- [Cheyenne] No.

05:06.270 --> 05:07.270
[Cliff] No?

05:07.270 --> 05:08.940
- You all, is that potato?
- Is that potato?

05:08.940 --> 05:11.370
This is not any mashed
potatoes we've ever had.

05:11.370 --> 05:12.640
[Cliff] Are you sure
it's potato?

05:12.640 --> 05:13.910
I'm not sure that it's potato.

05:13.910 --> 05:16.740
[Eddie] It might be...
It's almost like grits.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.110
[Cliff] Guys, guys, guys.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.880
Do you know the difference
between mashed potatoes and grits?

05:20.880 --> 05:23.250
Okay. Okay, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.650
We know the difference between
grits and mashed potato.

05:25.650 --> 05:26.790
- Yes.
- Correct.

05:26.790 --> 05:27.890
[Cliff] Okay.
Which is it?

05:27.890 --> 05:29.690
<i>[Eddie] Cheyenne
and I are from the country.</i>

05:29.690 --> 05:31.090
We don't know really what it is,

05:31.090 --> 05:33.060
but it definitely
tastes like grits.

05:33.060 --> 05:34.260
- Grits.
- Grits.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.100
- Okay, I have grits.
- Yes.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.800
- Yes?
- [Cheyenne] Yes, grits.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.270
There's mushroom
inside of the grits.

05:39.270 --> 05:40.330
[Anne] What kind of mushroom?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.900
Um, they're thin...

05:41.900 --> 05:45.310
In the grits we see
some kind of mushroom...

05:45.310 --> 05:48.280
[Anne] Are they like
a shiitake or like a cremini?

05:48.280 --> 05:49.440
Little ones.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.350
They're little mushrooms,
Chef Anne.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.150
- Yes.
- They're cremini mushrooms?

05:53.150 --> 05:54.150
- Yes.
- Yes.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.350
[Anne] And on top is...

05:55.350 --> 05:57.420
Are they like dried mushrooms
that have been...

05:57.420 --> 05:59.220
Oh, my gosh, maybe.

05:59.220 --> 06:01.860
What kind of mushroom,
is that shiitake maybe?

06:01.860 --> 06:03.260
- Dark brown.
- Well.

06:03.260 --> 06:06.030
- Well, they look...
- Come on, you guys.

06:06.030 --> 06:08.100
So, I have two kinds
of mushrooms?

06:08.100 --> 06:09.030
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:09.030 --> 06:12.230
So in my polenta, I use
shiitake mushrooms

06:12.230 --> 06:17.270
<i>and we are going to top the
polenta with creamy mushrooms.</i>

06:17.270 --> 06:19.670
[Cliff] We've got grits,
no potato. Yes?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.340
- Um, yeah, let's do grits.
- Grits, correct.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.040
And they are sliced.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.010
- This is a mushroom, correct?
- [Eddie] Mm-hmm.

06:25.010 --> 06:29.180
We are finding cooked
mushrooms inside of this grit mixture.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.320
[Cliff] What kinds of mushrooms?

06:30.320 --> 06:33.320
Are they skinny, shiitake?

06:33.320 --> 06:35.160
[Cliff] Do you know what a
shitake mushroom looks like?

06:35.160 --> 06:36.690
- No.
- [Peachez] No.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.390
[Cliff] Okay,
what do they look like?

06:38.390 --> 06:40.230
This is the one
that has the big top.

06:40.230 --> 06:42.130
Okay. You think
they are creminis? Okay.

06:42.130 --> 06:44.160
<i>Okay, we're hoping
those are cremini</i>

06:44.170 --> 06:46.600
because that's what I grab based
on everything you guys are describing.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.930
- [Peachez] Absolutely.
- Mm-hmm.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.140
I don't know who cremini is,
but I bet she came to the party.

06:51.140 --> 06:55.010
[Marti] And on the side, there's
spinach with like vinegar and, um, onions.

06:55.010 --> 06:56.880
[Hilda] That's not an onion.
What is this?

06:56.880 --> 06:58.410
- [Marti] Um...
- Is it fennel?

06:58.410 --> 06:59.980
- [Hilda] Tastes like fennel.
- It's fennel.

06:59.980 --> 07:02.120
Next to the steak
are some greens.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.250
[Marti] It's like,
it's like wilted.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.020
That's a spinach.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.650
That's spinach
with vinegar, yeah.

07:06.660 --> 07:10.190
[Kara] And we don't know
what kind of greens.

07:10.190 --> 07:11.760
[Marti] It's either spinach
or collard green.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.130
No.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.030
[Marti] We got to figure out,
we have 18 minutes.

07:15.030 --> 07:18.270
Is this spinach? Is it kale?
Is it spinach and kale?

07:18.270 --> 07:19.770
Is it collard greens?

07:19.770 --> 07:21.070
Maybe it's collard greens.

07:21.070 --> 07:22.900
[Marti] They don't taste
like collard green.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.340
This has a really
bitter taste to it.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.370
- [bleep]
- That is collard greens.

07:25.370 --> 07:26.970
- It is collard greens? Okay.
- Yeah.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.340
- [Kara] Okay, cool.
- Collard greens with fennel.

07:28.340 --> 07:29.580
Okay.

07:29.810 --> 07:31.750
<i>[Marti] It doesn't look like
collard greens per se,</i>

07:31.750 --> 07:33.110
but it tastes like
collard greens.

07:33.110 --> 07:36.080
So you know what? Chef Anne,
figure it out, it's collard greens.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.390
Okay, so we've got New
York strip, we have a creamy,

07:38.390 --> 07:40.190
cheesy grit situation out.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.360
And there's also a green
that's cooked here.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.390
What's the green?

07:43.390 --> 07:45.030
Oh, that's terrible.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.060
Are the greens peppery?

07:46.060 --> 07:47.060
Oh, oh, oh!

07:47.060 --> 07:48.700
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.030
-These are mustard greens. These are mustard greens.
-[Eddie] Yes, yes.

07:51.030 --> 07:53.170
[Peachez] I worked in a
grocery store for five years,

07:53.170 --> 07:55.400
so I know all kinds of produce.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.140
Do you know what a
shiitake mushroom looks like?

07:57.140 --> 07:58.310
- No.
- No.

07:58.310 --> 08:00.270
Now we have to figure out
what's in here.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.980
- They are not radish.
- These are shallots?

08:01.980 --> 08:05.850
<i>[Peachez] We can't figure out
what this vegetable is.</i>

08:05.850 --> 08:08.880
<i>I'm asking Cheyenne,
Cheyenne's looking at me like,</i>

08:08.880 --> 08:09.950
<i>"I don't know, girl."</i>

08:09.950 --> 08:11.490
<i>I'm looking at Eddie.</i>

08:11.490 --> 08:13.320
<i>Eddie's like, "It just tastes
like vinegar."</i>

08:13.320 --> 08:16.020
What is this mystery vegetable?

08:16.020 --> 08:17.990
[Cliff] Okay, the shallot
and the mustard green?

08:17.990 --> 08:19.230
- [Cheyenne] Yes.
- [Eddie] Yes.

08:19.230 --> 08:20.890
And an unidentified vegetable.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.360
Eddie, it's not a UFO
on the plate, buddy.

08:23.370 --> 08:27.000
You can't say unidentifiable
because it's definitely identifiable.

08:30.340 --> 08:31.570
Oh!

08:32.740 --> 08:34.240
[Cliff] Did I lose all of you
at the same time?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.610
- [Eddie] No, but we're really
trying to-- - Did I lose all of you?

08:36.610 --> 08:39.050
[Eddie] We're trying to tell him
what they are and he's getting angry.

08:39.050 --> 08:41.380
[Cliff] Any time you guys want
to talk, any time you want to talk?

08:41.380 --> 08:42.880
<i>[Eddie] And we don't know
what to tell him.</i>

08:42.890 --> 08:44.250
<i>And he needs an answer right now</i>

08:44.250 --> 08:45.650
and I don't think
we can give him one.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.360
What does it taste like?
What does it taste like?

08:48.360 --> 08:51.020
[Peachez] We're tasting,
chef is yelling at us.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.490
Please, please, please.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.860
<i>Yes?</i>

08:54.860 --> 08:56.430
[Eddie] I don't know.

08:56.430 --> 08:57.930
Welcome to work.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.710
So, here's what's going
to happen right now,

09:08.710 --> 09:10.810
we're gonna bust out something
that's just tasty.

09:10.810 --> 09:13.480
I feel the Blue team is really
trying their best right now,

09:13.480 --> 09:18.150
but I also can't help feel that
time is just passing me by.

09:18.150 --> 09:20.050
We have 10 minutes left.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.120
I'm sorry,
I've got five minutes left.

09:22.120 --> 09:25.260
And I have almost
nothing cooked.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.290
The plating that...

09:26.300 --> 09:30.060
[laughter]

09:30.070 --> 09:31.570
Are you ready to plate, Chef?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.830
I'm just trying to keep
the glass half full.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.240
I love you, guys.

09:38.710 --> 09:41.470
- In the sauce that is on top?
- This is the sauce on top, yeah.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.740
[Kara] It kind of looks like
a salsa verde or a pesto.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.480
[Marti] The salsa is green.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.380
- [Kara] Yeah, it looks kind of like a verde sauce.
- [Anne] What herb is it?

09:47.380 --> 09:49.520
[Kara] I'm definitely
tasting cilantro.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.980
There was a nut somewhere.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.690
- What kind of nut?
- [Kara] There's a pine nut.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.020
[Anne] Kind of
looks like a pesto?

09:54.020 --> 09:55.990
- Yes, that's it.
- [Anne] Yes.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.390
No, there's something
spicy in it.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.160
[Anne] Like a jalapeño
or something?

10:00.160 --> 10:01.490
[Kara] It could be
a jalapeño because--

10:01.500 --> 10:02.930
[Anne] Or is it like a serrano?

10:02.930 --> 10:04.160
Is it really spicy or not?

10:04.170 --> 10:06.070
[Hilda] It's spicy.
It's burning me.

10:06.070 --> 10:07.800
- It's spicy.
- Really spicy?

10:07.800 --> 10:10.000
- Really spicy.
- No, not really spicy.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.970
[Hilda] I'm saying this is
spicy and they're saying it's not.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.040
Just... Just enough
to make your--

10:15.040 --> 10:16.940
- I don't think it's the seeds.
- I feel it.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.750
What do you two know?
Go away.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.180
[Anne] And that's in salsa?

10:20.180 --> 10:22.220
- [Marti] The salsa.
- [Hilda] Yeah, in the salsa.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.750
I'm concerned about this sauce that
you're gonna have to make for the steak.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.820
<i>[Peachez] There is a sauce
on this steak</i>

10:26.820 --> 10:29.820
and we are going to get
to the bottom of what is in it.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.730
Oh, it's spicy.
There's jalapeño in there.

10:31.730 --> 10:32.990
I see garlic cloves.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.100
Garlic, maybe couscous,
some herbs, cilantro.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.330
What is in this sauce?

10:38.330 --> 10:39.370
What is that?

10:39.370 --> 10:40.930
- That's a pine nut.
- [Cheyenne] Okay.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.140
Jalapeño, garlic,
pine nuts in the sauce.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.970
Cilantro in the sauce.

10:44.970 --> 10:47.010
What are the little
white things in here

10:47.010 --> 10:49.080
besides the garlic
and the pine nuts?

10:49.080 --> 10:51.140
I say, it almost tastes
like a parmesan.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.280
Parmesan cheese.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.750
You all, it's parmesan cheese.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.380
[Cliff] Does it?

10:55.380 --> 10:57.950
[Cheyenne] It has the texture of
parmesan when you put it in your mouth.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.120
- Right. Is it?
- Is it though?

11:00.120 --> 11:02.260
[Cliff] Everything they're
telling me that's in the sauce

11:02.260 --> 11:04.820
<i>sounds like a pine nut
salsa verde,</i>

11:04.830 --> 11:06.430
and there wouldn't be
cheese in that.

11:06.430 --> 11:08.860
- It doesn't make any sense.
- No, no.

11:08.860 --> 11:09.960
[Peachez]
I'm not the chef here.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.900
You're the chef, Chef Cliff.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.270
I'm listening to you, even though
you're supposed to be listening to me.

11:14.270 --> 11:15.700
Okay.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.270
Parmesan is not getting
added to the salsa.

11:18.270 --> 11:21.310
We have three minutes left. What
else could you possibly tell me?

11:21.310 --> 11:22.410
Three minutes left.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.110
All right, talk to me
about plating.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.910
So plating, you're gonna
take the meat,

11:25.910 --> 11:28.080
have it lying from six to four.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.050
How's the steak slice?

11:29.050 --> 11:30.950
I feel like a recruit right now.

11:30.950 --> 11:34.190
There's under two minutes, and
I haven't even started plating yet.

11:34.190 --> 11:36.160
There are five or six slices.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.230
Five or six slices going perpendicular
to the long way of the steak.

11:39.230 --> 11:42.360
[Cliff] I need
every second of time.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.130
All right, this is
just gonna be...

11:44.130 --> 11:46.400
Okay, this is a very
unfamiliar feeling.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.830
I don't know if I like this.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.340
Forty seconds and counting.

11:49.340 --> 11:52.170
All right. Three and four, the
steak is between four and six.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.770
<i>[Marti] Yes, chef.</i>

11:53.780 --> 11:57.240
And then right above it, between three
and one, you have the collard greens.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.880
I think I did the wrong steak.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.610
- I bet you it's a strip steak and I used a ribeye.
- That's okay.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.020
That's okay. We're gonna
cross that bridge...

12:03.020 --> 12:04.980
- Yeah, I don't know that it--
<i>- [Marti] ...when we get to it.</i>

12:04.990 --> 12:06.020
It looks like a triangle.

12:06.020 --> 12:08.020
[Anne] It looks like a triangle?

12:08.020 --> 12:10.120
- No, it does not look like a triangle, Hilda.
- What's that?

12:10.130 --> 12:11.860
- It looks like this...
- Hold up.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.330
[laughter]

12:13.330 --> 12:14.990
Okay, I don't...
You know what?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.660
This is what's going
to happen right now.

12:16.670 --> 12:21.670
[recruits] Five, four,
three, two one.

12:21.670 --> 12:23.100
Whoo!

12:23.110 --> 12:24.300
Good job, y'all.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.770
Different party over there.

12:25.770 --> 12:27.870
[Cliff] I don't even know
what's happening right now.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.110
You know what?
I bet you they cooked pork.

12:30.410 --> 12:32.050
It's so uncomfortable.

12:33.010 --> 12:34.150
- [Cheyenne] Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.020
[Anne] All right. Recruits,
that was fun, wasn't it?

12:37.020 --> 12:38.450
[laughter]

12:38.450 --> 12:40.120
Yes, we had a blast.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.350
Did you have fun, Cliff?

12:41.360 --> 12:43.860
[Cliff mimics crying]

12:43.860 --> 12:47.890
[Peachez] Honestly, I know he's
proud of us, even if it's just in spirit.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.060
[Anne] I can't wait to see
how we did.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.030
[Cliff] Shall we haves a look
at the original?

12:53.030 --> 12:55.030
- Yes.
- I'm almost afraid to do this right now.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.870
[Kara] Oh, no, no!

12:56.870 --> 12:58.870
It looks identical to our plate.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.110
[Cliff] Not, not far.
[exclaims]

13:01.110 --> 13:02.910
So close.

13:02.910 --> 13:06.280
[Kara] It looks like Chef Anne's
dish could be related to the original.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.380
Kind of, kind of.

13:07.380 --> 13:10.480
[Kara] Maybe like
a second cousin, third cousin.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.920
So close.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.290
Oh, it's a ribeye.

13:13.290 --> 13:15.390
[cheering and laughing]

13:15.390 --> 13:17.160
- [Marti] Yes!
- Yes!

13:17.160 --> 13:19.290
Yes! All right,
got this one.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.390
We have a jalapeño pesto.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.030
- I used a serrano instead of a jalapeño.
- [Cliff] Okay.

13:24.030 --> 13:25.570
[Anne] You have jalapeño,
I do not.

13:25.570 --> 13:28.170
I said jalapeño, Chef Anne.

13:28.170 --> 13:29.440
Well.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.240
[Hilda] And that's why you
should always listen to Hilda.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.310
It looks like a triangle.
Is that what that is?

13:34.310 --> 13:35.940
[Anne] It looks like a triangle?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.140
- No, it doesn't look like a triangle, Hilda.
- [speaking indistinctly]

13:39.080 --> 13:40.310
I have cilantro.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.980
Then sure enough...

13:41.980 --> 13:43.350
Parmesan, no Parmesan.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.190
Oh!

13:45.190 --> 13:47.520
I! I told you!

13:47.520 --> 13:50.390
I apologize for the Parmesan
that I did not believe.

13:50.390 --> 13:51.660
Mustard greens.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.960
I don't have fennel,
we have garlic.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.030
[Anne] So I had collard
greens, I have fennel,

13:56.030 --> 13:57.300
I have garlic.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.300
[Cliff] In the polenta there
were shiitake mushrooms--

13:59.300 --> 14:00.830
So, I have shiitake and cremini.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.170
We didn't get the steak though.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.140
That would have been
the coup de grâce.

14:04.140 --> 14:05.210
No, you guys did
a good job though.

14:05.210 --> 14:06.740
Man, this is close, though.

14:06.740 --> 14:10.680
I mean, if we kind of go down
the list and count them up...

14:10.680 --> 14:12.810
[Kara] At this point,
it's anybody's game.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.950
It could go either way.

14:13.950 --> 14:17.020
[Anne] I would say, by a hair,

14:17.020 --> 14:21.520
this one goes to Red team.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.290
[cheering]

14:23.290 --> 14:24.390
[Marti] We won!

14:24.390 --> 14:25.590
Bi-ba-bi-ba-bow!

14:25.590 --> 14:27.160
Well done.

14:27.160 --> 14:31.160
[Anne] I will let my rocking red
star ladies boss me around any time.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.270
Nope, nope, nope.

14:34.270 --> 14:36.600
Yeah, we're so, we're so close.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.940
I'm happy for the Red team.

14:38.940 --> 14:41.470
It's the first skill drill they've
won in a very, very long time.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.710
We're so close.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.180
And their last.

14:44.180 --> 14:48.510
So, recruits, we dipped our
toe into the waters of you guys

14:48.520 --> 14:50.380
having a little bit of freedom.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.190
What do you think, Cliff? I think
the training wheels should come off.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.090
[Hilda] Oh, no!

14:55.090 --> 14:56.320
Fly away, little birds.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.790
- [all exclaiming]
- Okay.

14:57.790 --> 14:59.630
-Not so fast. We'll flap.
-[laughter]

15:00.300 --> 15:03.230
For today's main dish challenge,

15:03.230 --> 15:07.370
you guys will be making
an elevated dish

15:07.370 --> 15:11.100
for two designed by you.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.010
[all exclaiming]

15:13.010 --> 15:15.740
[Anne] Let's not have
any phoning it in today

15:15.740 --> 15:20.180
because for two of you, this will
be your last cook in Boot Camp.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.350
[Eddie] It's scary
out here right now.

15:22.350 --> 15:25.820
No, someone's going home
today, and it can't be me.

15:25.820 --> 15:28.020
I'm damn sure
it is not gonna be me.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.390
I don't want to go home.

15:29.860 --> 15:32.790
Please don't make me leave.

15:32.790 --> 15:35.630
I also don't want to go home because
that means I got to go back to work.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.660
Show us you want to be here.

15:37.670 --> 15:41.330
I also don't want to go home
because I want to win $25,000

15:41.340 --> 15:44.670
and get a new kitchen and
maybe a lawnmower for Vinny.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.240
<i>[narrator] Find out next
on Worst Cooks in America.</i>

15:52.710 --> 15:57.250
[Anne] I'm going to show you
guys how to cook a fillet mignon

15:57.250 --> 16:03.190
<i>with a mushroom demi-glace
sauce and shoestring potatoes.</i>

16:03.190 --> 16:06.090
You guys will be responsible

16:06.090 --> 16:11.000
for making your
own sauce and side dish.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.870
[Cliff] Today, I'm gonna be
showing you how to make

16:12.870 --> 16:16.070
a cumin cilantro duck breast,
apricot jus and eggplant.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.670
- [recruits exclaim]
<i>- [Eddie] I'm excited.</i>

16:17.670 --> 16:19.470
I've never even had duck.
Quack-quack.

16:19.470 --> 16:21.810
[Anne] I'm gonna start off
with Yukon Gold potatoes.

16:21.810 --> 16:22.980
Peel them.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.040
Now with the mandolin,
take my potato stacks,

16:25.050 --> 16:27.380
cut them really finely,
wash the starch off.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.320
So, they will fry up
really nice and crispy.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.020
First thing we're gonna do,
my duck breast.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.590
It's a nice,
beautiful layer of fat

16:33.590 --> 16:35.460
and then underneath that,
is a layer of meat.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.660
In order to render the duck
fat, I'm going to score the skin,

16:38.660 --> 16:40.330
I'm gonna season it
fairly aggressively.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.460
I'm gonna lay my duck breast
fat side down.

16:42.460 --> 16:47.930
Very, very low and slow so that
we render or cook down that fat,

16:47.940 --> 16:49.740
and that fat will
start to crisp up.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.140
And we're gonna baste
the duck in its own fat.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.480
[Eddie] Like the duck fat that we
use for those potatoes early on?

16:56.480 --> 16:58.380
- Yeah.
- The fingerling potatoes.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.410
Yes.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.910
Beef tenderloin,
salt everywhere.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.420
A little smoked paprika,
onion powder, granulated garlic.

17:05.420 --> 17:11.960
Then to really keep it a nice,
tight roll of meat, tie it up,

17:11.960 --> 17:14.030
make a knot, tuck the tail in.

17:14.030 --> 17:18.130
Then we're gonna go downtown
and then we finish where we started.

17:18.130 --> 17:21.230
I am going to get
my steak seared

17:21.240 --> 17:23.040
because brown food tastes good.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.710
All the sides
we're looking for here.

17:25.710 --> 17:28.310
Really nice and brown, put
it on the rack and in the oven.

17:29.810 --> 17:31.340
The sauce work,
we're gonna make a gastrique.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.250
Some vinegar and sugar
reduced is a gastrique.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.450
Rough cut shallot, bay leaf,
two sprigs of thyme.

17:36.450 --> 17:39.190
So once they're translucent
and we're looking like this...

17:39.190 --> 17:40.020
- [recruits] Mm-hmm.
- [Cliff] Yeah?

17:40.020 --> 17:41.120
Yep.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.660
To this, I'm going to add,
green peppercorn, sugar,

17:43.660 --> 17:45.960
sherry vinegar,
then I'm gonna add red wine.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.460
Cook this down until there's
barely anything left.

17:49.460 --> 17:53.000
My potatoes, you want to work
in small batches here.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.170
And that's just oil in there?

17:54.170 --> 17:56.300
That's just oil.
That's a deep fryer.

17:56.300 --> 18:00.370
If you don't have a deep fryer at home, would
you just like, put in the pan, a lot of oil?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.810
You want them like
completely under the oil.

18:02.810 --> 18:05.680
- Okay.
- Give these guys a little bit of a swish.

18:05.680 --> 18:09.080
You see, we're starting to get nice
and, and brown and crispy a little bit.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.720
So there we go.
Salt these guys.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.550
I have a question about
mashed potatoes.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.020
- If you wanted to put cheese in the mashed potatoes...
- Uh-huh.

18:16.020 --> 18:17.960
Would you just shred it and
then put it in when they're warm?

18:17.960 --> 18:19.490
Yep. Uh-huh!

18:19.490 --> 18:22.160
Now, would you do that before you
add the, the hot milk in the butter?

18:22.160 --> 18:26.000
No, make your mashed potatoes,
and then add your flavors in later.

18:26.000 --> 18:26.800
Okay.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.040
So my red wine is almost there.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.710
To this I add one cup of demi,
a little bit of oil,

18:32.710 --> 18:34.710
my apricots, building
layers of flavor in there.

18:34.710 --> 18:40.150
If you're using a fresh fruit,
would you do the demi first

18:40.150 --> 18:43.280
and then wait till the very, very
end to do a fresh fruit into it?

18:43.280 --> 18:46.320
I would add fresh fruit into
the base of the sauce

18:46.320 --> 18:48.650
with the sugar, the red wine,
and sherry.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.760
Okay.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.790
Let's move on to mushrooms
and sauce.

18:51.790 --> 18:55.230
Slice everybody, get a
shallot diced, really finely.

18:55.230 --> 18:56.860
A little bit of oil in there.

18:56.870 --> 18:59.170
Let these wilt a little bit.

18:59.170 --> 19:01.570
I'm going to do
what's called flambéing.

19:01.570 --> 19:03.340
- Okay.
- Oh!

19:03.340 --> 19:08.610
Nice hot pan, pull it back, pour the
alcohol in, and then tip it forward and...

19:09.140 --> 19:10.340
Whoo!

19:11.110 --> 19:12.410
Whoo-hoo!

19:12.480 --> 19:15.380
[Marti] Does Chef Anne know
how much product is from here up?

19:15.380 --> 19:17.920
A lot of hairspray over here.
I'm really nervous.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.650
I'm highly flammable.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.020
I've got my hairspray, girl.

19:21.020 --> 19:22.990
I've never caught
my hair on fire.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.020
All the alcohol has cooked off.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.930
Now to add this veal demi-glace,
and then we cook it down

19:27.930 --> 19:29.960
until it's the perfect
consistency.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.360
Checking our duck breast.

19:31.530 --> 19:33.200
Whoo!

19:33.200 --> 19:35.330
So I'm gonna take some of this
beautiful duck fat,

19:35.340 --> 19:38.070
I'm gonna cook the eggplant
in that duck fat.

19:38.070 --> 19:39.440
[Anne] Let's go check my steak.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.280
[all exclaiming]

19:42.280 --> 19:44.010
Pull them out and let them rest.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.310
[Cliff] Turn my duck fats over,

19:45.310 --> 19:47.110
and then there's
a vegetable garnish.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.080
So, the cumin is gonna
get mixed with cilantro stem,

19:50.080 --> 19:51.480
and that's gonna be the crust.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.690
Spoonful of honey.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.250
I am lightly brushing this duck.

19:54.260 --> 19:57.390
Spread it out, stick it to
everything, and we're done with that.

19:57.390 --> 20:01.090
Remove this string and
let's make some nice slices.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.200
And then we're gonna
go right on there.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.500
A haystack of little
potato sticks,

20:05.500 --> 20:08.570
our sauce, and there we go!

20:08.570 --> 20:09.670
Now, we're ready to plate.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.370
I want three nice slices,
then our eggplant garnish.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.040
And I'm gonna sauce my plate.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.980
- Here is your duck.
- Look at that.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.810
Good Lord.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.680
[Marti] There's so many flavors
happening and they're all so good.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.280
- That's crispy duck fat.
- Mm-hmm.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.350
I love that.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.120
[Cliff] Okay, recruits,
for this challenge,

20:25.120 --> 20:28.490
you'll have 60 minutes to
replicate my protein exactly.

20:28.490 --> 20:33.490
[Anne] And make a side dish
and a sauce, any way you want.

20:33.490 --> 20:35.360
- Your time starts right now.
- [recruits] Go.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.100
[whooping]

20:38.100 --> 20:39.670
I like your shirt today, Eddie.

20:39.670 --> 20:40.670
[Eddie] Thank you.

20:40.670 --> 20:41.800
Brandy might be good.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.340
Let's do this!

20:43.340 --> 20:46.410
Cutting through the fat,
cutting through the fats.

20:46.410 --> 20:49.210
[Marti] We are getting her
into her little costume.

20:49.210 --> 20:50.810
Eddie, beautiful.

20:50.810 --> 20:51.640
Thank you.

20:53.150 --> 20:54.280
[Peachez]
So, for this challenge,

20:54.280 --> 20:57.220
I'm making cumin and
cilantro-crusted duck breast

20:57.220 --> 21:00.620
with a side of corn
and mango sauce.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.320
My favorite thing is
mango salsa,

21:02.320 --> 21:04.160
so I wanted to try and do a
little play on that, you know?

21:04.160 --> 21:05.420
Okay.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.260
Pairs well with the duck,
pairs well with the cilantro.

21:07.260 --> 21:08.660
If we do it right.

21:08.660 --> 21:12.060
It is a double elimination,
no one is safe.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.470
Oh, I hate this.

21:13.470 --> 21:15.740
I look over and I realized
that Eddie and Cheyenne

21:15.740 --> 21:18.470
both are already scored
and cooking.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.870
I can hear your duck
and it sounds happy.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.140
Thank you.

21:22.140 --> 21:23.110
It is a happy duck.

21:23.110 --> 21:25.880
If I don't get this together
and stay focused

21:25.880 --> 21:28.350
and keep moving forward,
this could be my last day.

21:28.350 --> 21:29.820
Here we go.

21:29.820 --> 21:32.520
<i>I have no time for that.</i>

21:32.520 --> 21:34.190
How's that duck doing?

21:34.190 --> 21:35.250
It's looking excellent.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.820
I need to prep these
veggies right now.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.390
For this dish, I'm making
a duck breast with orange

21:40.400 --> 21:43.060
<i>and allspice in the sauce
that I'm gonna make,</i>

21:43.060 --> 21:45.000
and these Brussels sprouts
are going to be my side.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.070
Allspice, half a teaspoon.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.100
This is gonna
taste like Christmas.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.940
Is anyone else using
Brussel sprouts, Blue team?

21:50.940 --> 21:52.400
[Eddie] No, ma'am.

21:52.410 --> 21:55.440
As I'm checking my duck, I noticed
there's so much fat in the cast iron.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.180
So, I decided to drain that off

21:57.180 --> 21:58.480
so I can use it in my
Brussels sprouts.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.680
Happy day.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.650
Ooh, yeah!

22:01.650 --> 22:04.750
We're gonna go with this,
ground coriander.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.890
Today, I'm making
mashed sweet potatoes.

22:07.890 --> 22:11.190
And I, of course,
have to represent Kentucky,

22:11.190 --> 22:12.890
- so I'm making a bourbon sauce.
- [horse whinnies]

22:12.890 --> 22:14.530
Now you are lassoed.

22:14.530 --> 22:17.860
But unfortunately, I'm having a
really hard time with this meat string.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.430
What do I do?

22:19.430 --> 22:24.900
Chef Anne said, put the string
on our thumb, pull our thumb back.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.210
[grunting]

22:26.210 --> 22:27.410
Where did I start?

22:27.410 --> 22:29.040
I don't know where I started.

22:29.040 --> 22:34.880
And then you put the circle
over the front of the meat

22:34.880 --> 22:36.950
and slide it down,
pull it tight.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.250
Christ!
It's okay.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.790
But it's a lot harder
than it looks.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.760
- Come on, Kara, let's go.
- [Kara] I know, I know.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.190
You are taking way too long.
Tie it up,

22:44.190 --> 22:46.490
- get it seared, and move on.
- [Kara] Yep.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.790
Everybody else, they've been
cooking their meat for a while.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.130
Ooh!

22:50.130 --> 22:53.030
Maybe I should have gone
to Girl Scouts.

22:53.030 --> 22:55.900
It's a big piece of meat
and it needs time to cook.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.300
All right.
Come on, Kara, let's go.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.040
I try to keep my composure.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.570
It's a stupid thing.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.380
- But--
- Come on, let's go.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.780
Inside, I'm having
a mini freak out.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.210
This is silly.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.780
I don't know where the top
and the bottom is to this thing.

23:08.780 --> 23:11.080
<i>This can't be happening again.</i>

23:11.090 --> 23:15.690
I'm not gonna let a little piece of
twine get between me and $25,000.

23:15.690 --> 23:17.560
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.900
[Kara] I am not as good at
this as I thought I would be.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.300
Come on, Kara.
Let's tie it up.

23:26.300 --> 23:28.930
[Kara] I am really struggling
to tie up my meat,

23:28.940 --> 23:31.400
but I will not let myself
fall behind.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.670
Here we go, little guy.
So it came under here.

23:33.670 --> 23:36.840
It doesn't look exactly
like Chef Anne's.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.880
There. Sheesh!

23:38.880 --> 23:40.910
But it'll do the job.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.450
Forty-five minutes, recruits.

23:42.450 --> 23:44.220
Okay. Come on,
you little [bleep]!

23:44.220 --> 23:45.350
Peachez, check your pot, though.

23:45.350 --> 23:47.150
- [Peachez] My what?
- Duck.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.090
- [Peachez] What?
- [Cliff] Your duck, check your duck.

23:49.090 --> 23:50.460
Quack!

23:50.460 --> 23:53.660
[Anne] Hilda, careful waving
that knife all over the place, please.

23:53.660 --> 23:54.690
You're making me so nervous.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.660
I'm glad you think it's funny.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.900
[Hilda] I'm not.
It's not funny, Chef Anne.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.400
[Cliff] Eddie, turn it down
a little more.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.300
[Eddie] Check my duck.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.770
Yeah, it's on low.
I mean...

24:04.770 --> 24:08.240
So rendering the duck is going
well, but my nerves are up there

24:08.240 --> 24:09.780
<i>because there's a lot
on the line</i>

24:09.780 --> 24:11.210
and now, we're getting
closer to the end,

24:11.210 --> 24:12.980
so you want to perform
and do well.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.150
But I'm, I'm somewhat calm...

24:15.150 --> 24:16.820
- Hey.
- [tires screeching]

24:16.820 --> 24:17.780
But I could be calmer.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.220
[Cliff] Eddie, compartmentalize.

24:20.220 --> 24:22.250
[Eddie] I'm frustrated because
I'm making a lot of trips

24:22.260 --> 24:24.420
to go get items
and that's killing time.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.890
I need sugar.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.830
Going and getting stuff from
the pantry is not going so hot.

24:31.830 --> 24:34.170
I think it's going well
until I'm at my station,

24:34.170 --> 24:35.270
<i>I realize I'm missing something,</i>

24:35.270 --> 24:37.400
and then I got to go back
and I got to go get sugar.

24:37.410 --> 24:38.970
- [Cliff] Eddie.
- [Eddie] But then I think,

24:38.970 --> 24:40.370
what am I gonna
get the sugar with?

24:40.370 --> 24:42.340
I'm not gonna bring
the big jar back with me.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.640
[Cliff] Eddie.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.880
[Eddie] I'm not a big old bear
just hoarding all of the food.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.110
[Cliff] Eddie.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.850
[Eddie] I'm doing sprints
back and forth at this point.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.850
Come here. Stop.
Come here. Come here.

24:50.850 --> 24:53.350
You appear to be
forgetting a lot of things.

24:53.350 --> 24:56.760
So the next time you run off
to go grab, God knows what,

24:56.760 --> 24:58.060
grab everything
and bring it home.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.160
- Mm-hmm.
- Everything you need, all right? One shot.

25:00.160 --> 25:03.660
[Eddie] Chef Cliff says, "Eddie,
you got your duck cooking,

25:03.660 --> 25:07.370
you got everything you need,
just settle down and continue."

25:07.670 --> 25:08.570
That helps.

25:15.410 --> 25:16.510
It worked for a second.

25:16.510 --> 25:18.440
No rush, I just got
to get this done.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.850
Got to get it done.

25:19.850 --> 25:21.210
<i>Working under Chef Anne...</i>

25:21.220 --> 25:22.310
[exhales sharply]

25:22.320 --> 25:24.120
all eyes are on you.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.120
I would look at those
mushrooms, Hilda.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.420
- Ma'am?
- Mushrooms.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.420
You can't skip a beat.

25:30.420 --> 25:33.260
Don't make any mistakes.

25:34.230 --> 25:36.300
A little finer.
Right, all right.

25:36.300 --> 25:39.000
Okay. Well, it has to be
perfect, it can't be okay.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.270
It has to be perfect.

25:40.270 --> 25:45.910
Behind you 24/7 days
a week, she is on you.

25:45.910 --> 25:48.070
- Tiny, tiny.
- Hilda.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.980
She's always there.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.410
She's always behind me.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.510
Is she here?

25:57.690 --> 25:59.150
She's... she's everywhere.

25:59.150 --> 26:00.990
Chef Anne scares me.

26:00.990 --> 26:05.690
[Kara] Okay, so if I'm doing
the sauce, I'm going to flambé.

26:05.690 --> 26:08.360
It's very important to me
to show Chef Anne

26:08.360 --> 26:12.260
that I'm no longer afraid of
fire or hot things in the kitchen.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.500
You want me to stand by you
for moral support?

26:14.500 --> 26:16.970
- Um, yeah.
- [Anne] Okay.

26:16.970 --> 26:18.370
Please, if you don't mind.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.340
It looks like
it could be dangerous

26:20.340 --> 26:21.670
if I don't do it the right way.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.440
- [Anne] Okay.
- All right.

26:23.440 --> 26:27.350
Now, remember what we said,
bend your back leg.

26:27.350 --> 26:29.320
Look at me, bend your back leg,

26:29.320 --> 26:31.120
pull it all the way
off the heat,

26:31.120 --> 26:33.850
all the way off the heat,
all the way of the heat.

26:33.850 --> 26:35.620
- [Kara] Let me get my--
- Sorry.

26:35.620 --> 26:37.320
I got to get a good grip
on it here.

26:37.330 --> 26:39.260
- That's, that's, hang on, hang on.
- Okay, all the way... Yes.

26:39.260 --> 26:40.660
Put it down.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.960
And on.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.760
-Thank you. Oh, yes, much better.
-All right?

26:43.760 --> 26:45.430
- [Anne] All right, step--
- All the way off the heat.

26:45.430 --> 26:48.200
Bend your back leg.
All right, pour the booze in.

26:49.340 --> 26:51.370
Okay, good.
Now tip it forward.

26:51.370 --> 26:54.310
- [whooping]
- Perfect!

26:54.310 --> 26:56.180
My wife is so cool.

26:56.180 --> 26:59.110
[Kara] I'm like, this is
the most amazing thing ever.

26:59.110 --> 27:00.380
Whoo-hoo!

27:00.380 --> 27:02.280
I feel like a wizard.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.850
It is so cool.

27:03.850 --> 27:05.380
Like a fire wizard.

27:05.390 --> 27:08.250
Well, she likes fire,
because I burnt myself.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.960
How you doing, Eddie?

27:09.960 --> 27:11.960
- I'm doing good, Cheyenne.
- [Cheyenne] Good.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.130
[Eddie] Just was dicing my...

27:13.130 --> 27:15.060
- Mincing, mincing fine.
- [Eddie] Mincing...

27:15.060 --> 27:16.630
- [Cliff] Super, super fine.
- my cilantro.

27:16.630 --> 27:18.230
[Cheyenne] Good job.

27:18.230 --> 27:24.470
For my sauce, I'm gonna do an orange
mango red wine sauce with thyme and...

27:24.470 --> 27:26.470
Peppercorn. Peppercorn?

27:26.470 --> 27:27.710
[Eddie] Yes, peppercorn.

27:27.710 --> 27:28.910
Black peppercorn.

27:28.910 --> 27:31.740
I'm gonna model my base
after what Chef Cliff did,

27:31.750 --> 27:37.150
but I'm gonna add oranges, mango and
red wine vinegar instead of sherry sauce.

27:37.150 --> 27:39.750
I chose oranges because
I'm from Bradenton, Florida.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.490
There's a lot of oranges there.

27:41.490 --> 27:45.360
I love oranges and also mango
because Chef Cliff used it in demonstration

27:45.360 --> 27:47.930
and he told us he loves mango.

27:47.930 --> 27:49.290
I know you're not smiling
back there.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.600
Yeah.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.860
[sighing in exhaustion]

27:51.870 --> 27:54.570
I am trying to please
Chef Cliff.

27:54.570 --> 27:57.300
Oh, this is working so well.
Who knew?

27:57.300 --> 27:58.640
Doing good.

27:58.640 --> 27:59.810
Make it a sauce.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.140
Hey, how is that sauce, Eddie?

28:01.140 --> 28:02.680
Just reminding you that
you're making sauce.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.310
[Eddie] Yeah.
I salted it.

28:04.310 --> 28:06.650
I have to add a splash of wine
to it, but I got to taste it first.

28:06.650 --> 28:08.310
[Cliff] Wait.
Huh?

28:08.320 --> 28:10.380
[Eddie] This sauce is
so damn confusing.

28:10.380 --> 28:12.120
- You used red wine.
- [Cliff] Yeah.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.250
You splashed some
red wine on there.

28:13.250 --> 28:15.920
No, I finished it
with a little vinegar.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.620
- Do you have red wine in there?
- [Eddie] Yes.

28:17.630 --> 28:19.120
- [Cliff] Okay.
- [Eddie] Yeah.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.860
- [Cliff] So, I don't need any more red wine.
- I got vinegar here.

28:20.860 --> 28:22.160
So, after it reduces--

28:22.160 --> 28:24.600
How am I supposed to know
when it reduces enough?

28:24.600 --> 28:25.800
You have demi in there?

28:25.800 --> 28:29.900
I don't know. Red wine,
vinegar, all those ingredients...

28:29.900 --> 28:32.200
I say, I just throw it all in the
pot and see what happens.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.840
What's next?

28:34.840 --> 28:36.410
Add the demi-glace.

28:36.410 --> 28:41.110
My sauce is gonna be a bunch of
bold and big flavors mixed together.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.650
I am here to impress
Chef Anne and let her know

28:43.650 --> 28:47.250
that my palette is big,
bold and beautiful, okay?

28:47.250 --> 28:50.220
<i>I'm gonna think a little bit
about flavors of growing up.</i>

28:50.220 --> 28:52.290
What are the things
my dad likes with steaks?

28:52.290 --> 28:54.660
So we got the horseradish,
we got the Worcestershire,

28:54.660 --> 28:57.330
we got the cognac in it
to give the little flame.

28:57.330 --> 28:59.230
We're gonna throw in some
of those little baby pickles

28:59.230 --> 29:00.400
and some of that juice.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.870
[Anne] Are you flambéing?

29:01.870 --> 29:04.500
You want me to come stand
by you for moral support?

29:04.510 --> 29:05.970
Sure.
Come on down, come on down.

29:05.970 --> 29:07.110
- Okay.
- Let's do this together.

29:07.110 --> 29:09.270
Chef Anne from her perch
gets excited, she goes,

29:09.280 --> 29:11.110
"Wait for me, wait for me,
wait for me."

29:11.110 --> 29:13.650
So, she runs down and we
light this baby up together.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.810
Whoa!

29:15.820 --> 29:17.150
Come on, baby.

29:17.150 --> 29:19.990
And I feel the sparks
between the two of us.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.090
Sure.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.890
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Sure.

29:23.890 --> 29:26.960
I am her rocking red star.
I am her champion.

29:26.960 --> 29:30.430
It is me who is going to
give her the crown over Cliff.

29:34.370 --> 29:37.040
Ugh, this is disgusting.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.270
Mm-mm.

29:38.270 --> 29:41.840
<i>This is trash.
This is worse than trash.</i>

29:41.840 --> 29:45.640
You know when a trash bag
leaks, this is that.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.380
This is the leak of a trash bag.

29:47.380 --> 29:48.680
Oh, [bleep].

29:50.250 --> 29:51.550
That's not good.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.950
I would not serve this to my
least favorite person on Earth,

29:55.960 --> 29:56.990
you know who you are.

29:56.990 --> 29:58.690
It's not good.

29:58.690 --> 30:02.290
If I serve this to Chef Anne, she won't
even finish the day, she'll just say...

30:02.300 --> 30:06.300
[Marti speaking]

30:06.300 --> 30:07.870
I'll be eliminated.

30:07.870 --> 30:10.240
I need to do something.
'Cause this tastes like [bleep]!

30:16.140 --> 30:18.340
My sauce is, it's not good.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.680
A lot of flavors.

30:20.350 --> 30:22.250
She is flavorful, honey.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.180
We need to fix this immediately.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.750
Oh, my God,
you have to put butter in it.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.220
All right, let's see
how that tastes.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.360
I throw a couple of little
cubes of butter in there

30:30.360 --> 30:31.860
to just even it out.

30:31.860 --> 30:33.960
Butter, better.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.760
No more garbage, queen...

30:35.760 --> 30:36.930
Better.
That's better.

30:36.930 --> 30:39.430
but a classic queen.
We are high end.

30:39.430 --> 30:42.800
Still a little bitter, though.
[laughs, snorts]

30:42.800 --> 30:44.840
Just a comedy queen.
[laughs, snorts]

30:44.840 --> 30:46.910
Ten minutes.
We can do this, guys.

30:46.910 --> 30:48.270
[Eddie] Ten minutes, thank you.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.210
[Hilda] Let me get this sauce
out of the way.

30:50.210 --> 30:52.380
I'm using garlic, capers,
mushrooms.

30:52.380 --> 30:55.850
I don't want to flambé anything,

30:55.850 --> 31:00.290
so I'm making a red wine sauce
with capers, mushrooms.

31:00.290 --> 31:02.450
Where are the capers?
I need capers.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.620
Did I say capers?

31:03.620 --> 31:05.860
[Anne] Come on, Hilda.
Work it, girl. You got this.

31:05.860 --> 31:08.930
[Hilda] Like these flames
going all the way up to the roof

31:08.930 --> 31:10.960
and they're screaming
and yelling.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.000
Oh, baby, chef,
we are cooking, baby.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.200
Whoo!

31:14.200 --> 31:16.000
Girl, my eyebrows
are gonna sweat off.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.040
Ow! Ow!

31:18.040 --> 31:21.010
Not me, I'm not gonna
take the chance.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.510
I can just pour it
right in here?

31:22.510 --> 31:23.880
- [Anne] Right, but not a lot.
- Okay.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.680
<i>I've caused enough fires
in the kitchen</i>

31:25.680 --> 31:27.850
and I didn't want
to have one today.

31:27.850 --> 31:29.980
- How was that?
- Fine.

31:29.980 --> 31:35.350
Okay I'll be keeping this hair and
these eyebrows and eyelashes, no.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.060
<i>Mm-hmm.
Go right ahead.</i>

31:37.060 --> 31:38.060
I'm fine.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.130
[Cheyenne] Duck is done.
So happy with that.

31:40.130 --> 31:42.230
That's reducing, it
needs to go a little faster.

31:42.230 --> 31:45.030
- [Cliff] Rocking you--
- [Marti] No, no, no!

31:45.030 --> 31:47.100
- You okay, Mart-Mart?
- Yes.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.770
No. Come on. A little longer.

31:48.770 --> 31:50.500
- [Anne] That happens.
- Don't worry, just leave at that.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.940
Don't worry, it happens.
I knew that.

31:51.940 --> 31:53.040
How is that sauce, Eddie?

31:53.040 --> 31:54.270
[Eddie] Mm.
What am I doing?

31:54.270 --> 31:56.340
[Marti] Oh, my God, I forgot
I have to cut the damn steak

31:56.340 --> 31:58.340
and there's a whole thing
of meat that we have to do.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.980
[Anne] All right,
less than four minutes.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.680
- Let's be plating.
- Oh, oh!

32:01.680 --> 32:03.050
Oh, no.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.020
- [Anne] Hilda, make that look nice, huh?
- [Hilda] Yes, ma'am.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.220
[Marti] Oh, you're free,
darling. You're free.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.760
[Cliff] Slow movement.
Slice, slice, cut. No.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.290
Clean and make it ready.

32:11.290 --> 32:13.460
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- A ladle.

32:13.460 --> 32:14.930
- [Cliff] Peachez.
- [Peachez] Yes.

32:14.930 --> 32:16.230
Spoon, what are you doing?

32:16.230 --> 32:17.460
- Ay-ay-ay.
- Spoon.

32:17.460 --> 32:18.960
- [Cliff and Anne] Five...
- [Peachez] Oh, no.

32:18.970 --> 32:22.430
four, three, two, one.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.840
[Anne] That's it.
Hands up.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.140
You're done.

32:26.140 --> 32:27.340
- [Kara exclaims]
- Okay.

32:27.340 --> 32:28.670
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.980
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:29.980 --> 32:32.010
- Okay.
- I think these are good.

32:32.010 --> 32:34.110
- How do you feel, Eddie?
- [Eddie] I feel super.

32:34.110 --> 32:36.050
My face isn't going
to show it right now.

32:36.050 --> 32:38.150
[Anne] All right, let's
go try some fancy dinner.

32:38.150 --> 32:39.920
- What do you say?
- Let's go treat ourselves.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.050
Let's see
how we did. Eddie?

32:42.060 --> 32:45.290
[Eddie] I'm proud of my duck, but
I'm not sure that it's good enough,

32:45.290 --> 32:47.390
<i>especially in comparison
to my teammates.</i>

32:47.390 --> 32:50.330
[Cliff] Talk to me
about your cook.

32:50.330 --> 32:51.760
Starts laughing.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.370
I did a lot of laps
in here today.

32:53.370 --> 32:55.830
What have you prepared
after taking your laps?

32:55.840 --> 33:00.410
Orange mango sauce
and a side of yellow squash.

33:00.410 --> 33:01.810
The duck is rendered nicely.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.280
There's a lot of cumin.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.680
There's not enough cilantro.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.450
The consistency
of the sauce is nice.

33:06.450 --> 33:09.950
There's not enough orange
or mango in the sauce.

33:09.950 --> 33:11.650
It's not bad,
but it's not coming

33:11.650 --> 33:13.820
across the way
that you want it to.

33:13.820 --> 33:17.320
All and all, you tried to
replicate my dish dead on,

33:17.320 --> 33:18.860
instead of flying out
a little bit.

33:18.860 --> 33:21.030
[Eddie] Imitation is the best
form of flattery, right?

33:21.030 --> 33:22.430
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

33:22.430 --> 33:26.870
- [Cliff] Peachez?
- [Peachez] I made duck breast with street corn

33:26.870 --> 33:29.470
and a mango sauce to accompany.

33:29.470 --> 33:30.940
You did a great job
cooking the duck.

33:30.940 --> 33:32.070
Oh!

33:32.070 --> 33:33.440
I cooked the duck right.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.240
I told you, trust the process.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.310
Thank you.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.080
It's crispy, it's tender.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.640
Temperature is spot on.

33:39.650 --> 33:42.250
The sauce could use
a little bit of acid

33:42.250 --> 33:45.250
in order to counterbalance
the fattiness in the duck.

33:45.250 --> 33:47.250
The mango pairs well
with the corn. It really does.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.020
The mango pairs well
with the duck.

33:49.020 --> 33:52.290
I don't need a half or a
quarter of a mango on this plate.

33:52.290 --> 33:54.090
Coco Chanel,
sometimes less is more.

33:54.090 --> 33:55.390
- I get that.
- [Cliff] Yeah?

33:55.400 --> 33:57.300
-Mm-hmm. Thank you, chef.
-Thank you.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.900
Cheyenne?

33:58.900 --> 34:01.000
[Cheyenne] You ready
to eat some delicious duck?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.670
- [Cliff] I am. [indistinct]
- Do what?

34:03.670 --> 34:05.270
[Cliff laughs] Do what?
Give me your duck.

34:05.270 --> 34:07.010
What do we have, please?

34:07.010 --> 34:11.780
[Cheyenne] Cilantro, cumin-crusted
duck with allspice orange sauce

34:11.780 --> 34:14.350
with Brussel sprouts
fried in duck fat.

34:14.350 --> 34:16.420
The sauce is good.
Too much allspice.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.880
Do you love allspice?

34:17.890 --> 34:19.120
- [Cheyenne] No.
- No.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.550
[laughter]

34:20.550 --> 34:22.850
[Cliff] What made you go,
"You know what? Allspice."

34:22.860 --> 34:25.660
Allspice makes me think of
Christmas, so I felt like Christmas duck.

34:25.660 --> 34:26.990
Okay, all right.

34:26.990 --> 34:28.960
Doesn't make sense.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.900
Oh, and these Brussels, ooh,
slightly crunchy, huh?

34:30.900 --> 34:32.300
Mm-hmm.
On purpose.

34:32.300 --> 34:35.400
The duck is seasoned well,
these Brussels are banging.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.370
Yeah, they're banging, baby.

34:37.370 --> 34:39.140
- Nice work.
- Yeah.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.070
Yeah, yeah.

34:41.070 --> 34:43.780
- You know I'm coming after you for that.
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:43.780 --> 34:46.110
- [Cliff] The amount of time you've been here.
- [Cheyenne] Mm-hmm.

34:46.110 --> 34:48.450
You know better, and
you cooked your first duck.

34:48.450 --> 34:49.950
- I did.
- Yeah.

34:49.950 --> 34:51.880
- You can't eat that.
- Yeah.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.320
[Anne] Marti, come on up.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.990
[Marti] Walking up to Anne, I
feel like I'm going to the guillotine.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.420
I am so nervous.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.060
Hey, little buddy.

35:00.060 --> 35:01.260
Talk to me about what you made.

35:01.260 --> 35:04.230
[Marti] On top of the piece
of meat is onion powder,

35:04.230 --> 35:06.700
a little bit of mustard powder
and, uh, salt.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.170
Mashed potatoes.

35:08.170 --> 35:11.370
And in the sauce, I used the
three mushrooms that you used,

35:11.370 --> 35:14.810
those little pickles, Worcestershire
sauce, horseradish sauce, cognac.

35:14.810 --> 35:16.270
Oh, my God.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.180
[Marti] She is a really
letting that sauce

35:18.180 --> 35:20.080
just whoosh around in her mouth.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.980
She's like at a Napa wine
tasting with my...

35:25.150 --> 35:27.520
Do you like it?
Do you not like it?

35:32.490 --> 35:33.930
This is not good.

35:33.930 --> 35:37.460
Like, with that laundry list
of ingredients in there...

35:43.870 --> 35:47.010
I would say your sauce could have
been cooked down a little bit more.

35:47.010 --> 35:49.310
- Yeah, it was very liquidy.
- It's a little bit thin.

35:49.310 --> 35:50.310
[Marti] Yeah.

35:50.310 --> 35:52.140
[Anne] But I find your sauce
very exciting.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.680
- Oh!
- Really tasty.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.410
I like that you really pushed
yourself

35:55.420 --> 35:59.720
to try all of those flavors,
and to get them in there.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.250
Your steak is very, very rare.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.260
And the outside of it could
have been browned a bit more.

36:05.260 --> 36:07.490
You were on the road to doing
good things,

36:07.490 --> 36:10.330
but you just didn't make it
all the way there.

36:10.330 --> 36:11.630
All right, thank you.

36:11.630 --> 36:13.330
All right. Kara, come on up.

36:13.330 --> 36:18.000
I'm always nervous while I'm
walking up to Chef Anne. Always.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.670
I'm just anxious to see
what she has to say.

36:20.670 --> 36:26.780
So my steak is seasoned with ground
peppercorn, coriander, salt, and garlic powder.

36:26.780 --> 36:28.210
Sweet potatoes.

36:28.220 --> 36:32.620
And my sauce has onions,
garlic, brandy.

36:32.620 --> 36:35.390
It's also seasoned with
coriander and peppercorn.

36:35.390 --> 36:41.660
[Anne] I like that you carried out
the thought of putting the spices

36:41.660 --> 36:44.360
in your sauce that you used
on your tenderloin.

36:44.360 --> 36:48.370
Um, your tenderloin looks
a bit rare to me.

36:48.370 --> 36:51.870
Like, look, our steak is
cooked nicely on that half

36:51.870 --> 36:55.410
and then on this half is
where it's really, really rare.

36:55.410 --> 36:57.380
And that's because
it wasn't seared enough there.

36:57.380 --> 36:58.880
Okay.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.110
Your sweet potatoes,
they're really nice and fluffy.

37:01.110 --> 37:03.080
Your sauce has
a nice consistency.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.350
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

37:04.350 --> 37:06.220
- [Anne] Hilda?
- Oh, here I go.

37:06.220 --> 37:10.960
Walking up to Chef Anne, I
am confident this is a good plate.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.360
I have a smoked paprika
tenderloin.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.830
I also made sweet potatoes.

37:16.830 --> 37:20.330
The sauce is roasted garlic,
capers, mushrooms.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.000
- I hope you enjoy it.
- [Anne] Me, too.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.670
Your tenderloin, I see one
side that's really nice and brown

37:25.670 --> 37:28.170
and then the other side
not really so brown.

37:28.180 --> 37:31.180
Your sauce, I feel like
it could have more seasoning.

37:31.180 --> 37:34.310
But I salted that sauce. I
did put enough salt in there.

37:34.310 --> 37:36.110
I don't know
what's she talking about.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.150
[Anne] It is good, but I think
it could be a tiny bit yummier.

37:38.150 --> 37:40.290
I think your sweet potatoes
are yummy.

37:40.290 --> 37:43.220
I feel like you could have
plated like, a little bit nicer.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.590
- Thank you, Chef Anne.
- All right?

37:47.190 --> 37:49.630
We're all right.
[exhales]

37:49.630 --> 37:51.100
[Cliff]
Congratulations, recruits,

37:51.100 --> 37:53.930
we kicked you out of the nest
this week and you all flew.

37:54.070 --> 37:55.270
Cuckoo.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.300
But, unfortunately, two of
you will be leaving us today.

38:00.510 --> 38:03.310
As always, I like to start
with the good news.

38:03.310 --> 38:05.210
The winner today

38:05.210 --> 38:10.380
on the rocking red stars
is Kara.

38:10.380 --> 38:12.420
[recruits applauding]

38:12.420 --> 38:15.220
[Kara] I cannot believe I won.

38:15.220 --> 38:17.320
Oh, my gosh, I won!

38:17.320 --> 38:19.360
I'm in the final four.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.260
-Thank you, chef. Thank you.
-Wow.

38:21.430 --> 38:22.760
Oh!

38:22.860 --> 38:27.370
Unfortunately, that means Hilda
and Marti, you are in the bottom.

38:27.370 --> 38:28.200
Please step forward.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.100
Don't worry about it.

38:30.100 --> 38:34.210
[Cliff] And the winning dish on the
Blue team this week belongs to...

38:35.680 --> 38:36.910
Peachez.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.810
- [recruits applauding and
cheering] - Good job, Peachez.

38:39.810 --> 38:42.180
[Anne] You're on a little bit
of a roll there, Peachez.

38:42.180 --> 38:43.780
- [Cliff] Yes, she is.
- [Peachez] Ah!

38:43.780 --> 38:45.980
Final four!
[indistinct]

38:45.990 --> 38:47.920
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Who'd have thought?

38:47.920 --> 38:50.420
Who'd have thunk it?
You, you, you?

38:50.420 --> 38:51.720
I did it, baby.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.460
Keep the pedal to the medal.

38:53.460 --> 38:56.490
[Cliff] Unfortunately, that means
Cheyenne, Eddie, you're on the bottom.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.930
Please step forward.

38:57.930 --> 38:59.230
This feels familiar.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.970
All right, ladies.

39:01.970 --> 39:05.270
This was not your best cook
across the board.

39:05.270 --> 39:08.940
So because of that I decided
to take a little retrospective

39:08.940 --> 39:12.240
about the progression
of both of you.

39:12.250 --> 39:17.150
You ladies have both really
worked hard and improved a lot,

39:17.150 --> 39:21.720
but thinking about the
consistency of the improvement

39:21.720 --> 39:23.490
made my decision very clear.

39:25.230 --> 39:32.030
The recruit that will not be
continuing on in boot camp today is...

39:34.270 --> 39:35.130
Hilda.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.370
I told you.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.070
<i>I never thought I would have
ever learned how to cook.</i>

39:38.070 --> 39:42.070
Making it to the top three,
that's a gift in itself.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.140
- Sadly, I'm going to have to ask you for your apron.
- [Hilda] No problem.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.140
Thank you.

39:46.150 --> 39:49.150
<i>I can finally make my own meals.</i>

39:49.150 --> 39:51.780
When I get home my neighbors
are gonna be lining up

39:51.790 --> 39:54.350
around the block
to eat at my house.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.130
[Cliff] Similar to Chef Anne,
my decision was made

40:00.130 --> 40:03.090
based on the entirety
of the body of work.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.800
Eddie, you have weeks
where I'm trying to, you know,

40:05.800 --> 40:08.630
kick in, kick in the first
gear, and then other weeks

40:08.640 --> 40:10.940
you are firing on all cylinders.

40:10.940 --> 40:13.770
Cheyenne, you almost lost it.
You came back.

40:13.770 --> 40:16.980
And since you've been back,
you're a completely different cook.

40:16.980 --> 40:20.210
You're a hundred times more
confident than you were before.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.150
This is the hardest decision
I've had to make.

40:22.150 --> 40:26.220
But the recruit that will not
be moving forward is...

40:28.890 --> 40:29.820
Eddie.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.060
I'm gonna have to take
your apron, brother.

40:34.130 --> 40:36.590
[Eddie] Even though I'm being
sent home, I've learned a lot.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.100
I can go home and cook now
and actually enjoy it.

40:39.100 --> 40:42.930
My wife has learned how
to cook, so it's a win for me.

40:44.870 --> 40:46.870
[Anne] I mean, you're gonna
see him at home.

40:46.870 --> 40:50.140
I know. It will be okay.
It will be okay.

40:50.140 --> 40:52.040
Kara, you better go win this
for the both of us.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.580
I'm gonna do my best.

40:53.580 --> 40:57.220
You can't send my man away from
me and not expect me to come full force.

41:01.150 --> 41:03.820
- [Peachez] Bye, Eddie.
- See you.

41:03.820 --> 41:09.360
Congratulations,
you are the final four.

41:09.360 --> 41:12.500
You are one step closer
to cooking a three-course

41:12.500 --> 41:16.300
- restaurant quality meal for a panel of expert judges.
- [exhales]

41:16.300 --> 41:18.240
[all cheering]

41:18.240 --> 41:19.800
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

41:19.810 --> 41:21.940
Next week is the finale, people.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.540
It's gonna be the
toughest week of your lives.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.640
Get outta here.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.950
[indistinct cheering]

41:28.980 --> 41:31.280
<i>[narrator] Next time
on Worst Cooks in America...</i>

41:31.280 --> 41:32.620
[Peachez shouting indistinctly]

41:32.820 --> 41:37.020
<i>[Anne] We are going to send
you guys to a rooftop farm.</i>

41:37.020 --> 41:39.420
Roar, dandelion.
If you hear us, roar.

41:39.430 --> 41:40.930
Where the hell is the oregano?

41:40.930 --> 41:42.830
Where the hell is the oregano?

41:42.830 --> 41:44.760
I am having a heat stroke
right now.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.260
My wig is sweating off.

41:46.270 --> 41:49.130
[Cliff] You now have to make a
composed dish using your farm boughts.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.370
Work at it while it's hot.

41:50.370 --> 41:52.240
Baby, baby, baby,
down, down, down.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.170
- How are you doing, my steak?
- [shudders]

41:54.170 --> 41:55.340
This isn't stressful at all.

41:55.340 --> 41:57.440
[Anne] The recruits,
who will be...

41:57.440 --> 41:59.180
[Cliff] ...representing
me in the finale is...
