02:52.013 --> 02:53.002
(Chinese)

02:53.093 --> 02:56.165
(Chinese) Hey! Do not disturb our guests!

02:56.253 --> 02:59.529
(Chinese) You make us look bad.

03:02.093 --> 03:05.324
Long flight, huh, Mr Serrano?

03:05.413 --> 03:09.964
26 fuckin' hours, Tommy! 26 hours.

03:10.853 --> 03:12.844
26 hours?

03:13.453 --> 03:16.251
20 years to get you to come
to my country, my friend.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.563
Hey, come here.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.442
It's a long way from the south side, Tommy.

03:21.533 --> 03:22.966
Welcome, Mr Serrano.

03:23.053 --> 03:25.806
Mr Serrano? Get outta here! Tony.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.770
(Chinese) Do not fear the weapon.
Fear the man.

03:30.773 --> 03:32.764
Please... Tony.

03:44.653 --> 03:46.166
20 years.

03:46.253 --> 03:48.813
Can you believe it's been 20 years, Tony?

03:48.893 --> 03:51.043
Meanwhile, you still look like a kid.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.408
- Now look at me.
- (laughs)

03:53.493 --> 03:55.688
I got wrinkles on the inside, my friend!

03:55.773 --> 03:57.331
(speaks Chinese)

03:57.973 --> 04:01.966
- You don't know my worries, Tommy.
- Cocaine sales down 37 per cent.

04:02.053 --> 04:04.442
- You got good sources.
- CNN.

04:08.173 --> 04:09.891
Hey, uh...

04:10.653 --> 04:12.644
I need help, Tommy.

04:15.493 --> 04:17.848
Come. Let us see the fight.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.844
(crowd shouting)

04:42.213 --> 04:45.569
(Chinese) Sit in the back
and keep a watchful eye.

05:08.013 --> 05:11.085
Hey, Tommy,
I didn't come 10,000 fuckin' miles...

05:11.173 --> 05:13.812
...to watch these guys
fight with big toothpicks.

05:14.213 --> 05:16.249
Why did you come, Tony?

05:17.493 --> 05:20.371
You know why I'm hurting,
then you know why I came.

05:20.453 --> 05:24.651
I supply you with heroin, you distribute it.
It's good business for everyone.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.167
Better for you.

05:27.253 --> 05:30.290
I made you, Tommy. I want something back.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.092
I want a piece of your end.

05:33.173 --> 05:37.212
I like you, Mr Serrano. Don't push it!

05:41.573 --> 05:43.689
Listen to me, you fuckin' bastard!

05:43.973 --> 05:48.569
I got you started when all your couriers could
deliver were fortune cookies and chow mein.

05:48.653 --> 05:52.362
You were a fuckin' runner for me, Tommy.
That's your history.

05:52.453 --> 05:56.969
You owe me, the Tongs owe me,
everybody owes me.

05:57.053 --> 05:59.965
And I don't give a fuck who hears it!

07:23.853 --> 07:26.083
What the hell did he just say?

07:26.893 --> 07:29.248
It's a Sicilian proverb.

07:30.053 --> 07:33.648
It means "Don't ask for what you can't take."

07:41.733 --> 07:45.646
Machine guns cannot murder our dreams.

07:46.493 --> 07:49.485
Prisons cannot silence our voices.

07:51.413 --> 07:56.362
Two years ago today,
Tiananmen Square was a nightmare!

07:57.213 --> 08:00.967
But the dream of democracy lives on...

08:04.813 --> 08:06.804
Free China now!

08:06.893 --> 08:10.044
Free China now! Free China now!

08:10.733 --> 08:13.930
(crowd chanting)
Free China now! Free China now!

08:14.893 --> 08:17.248
- Check this out.
- Free China now!

08:17.653 --> 08:19.211
Free China now!

08:19.293 --> 08:22.126
Free China now! Free China now!

08:24.493 --> 08:26.927
(chanting in Chinese)

08:33.253 --> 08:35.244
(gunfire)

08:50.053 --> 08:52.044
(screaming)

08:53.293 --> 08:55.488
Dad! We have to get outta here!

08:55.973 --> 08:58.806
Jake! Jake, get out now!

09:00.413 --> 09:01.846
Agh!

09:02.213 --> 09:03.885
Dad!

09:04.933 --> 09:06.924
Jake!

09:08.693 --> 09:09.603
Jake!

09:09.693 --> 09:11.684
Dad!

09:14.253 --> 09:16.642
- Uh, Jake Lo, right?
- Yeah.

09:16.733 --> 09:20.965
- Hi. I'm Paul Yang.
- I know who you are. I'm not interested.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.085
You were there.

09:23.173 --> 09:27.530
We're having a fundraiser tonight. I thought
maybe you could speak to the students.

09:27.613 --> 09:29.331
No.

09:29.413 --> 09:31.449
Don't you care about the cause?

09:31.533 --> 09:33.524
Do you see me waving a flag?

09:34.453 --> 09:36.284
How can you not care?

09:36.373 --> 09:39.729
- (Chinese) I heard your father was killed.
- (Chinese) I think politics is bullshit.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.408
(Chinese) As for my father,
the man died for nothing.

09:52.613 --> 09:54.604
That's nice. That's good.

09:55.093 --> 09:57.812
Very good improvement.

10:03.573 --> 10:05.052
Jake...

10:05.133 --> 10:07.328
This is life study, OK?

10:07.413 --> 10:09.722
Just draw what you see.

10:09.813 --> 10:12.008
That's what I see.

10:15.013 --> 10:18.164
OK, everybody. Good work. See you Friday.

10:26.573 --> 10:28.689
Could I look at what you did?

10:29.533 --> 10:31.524
Sure. Yeah.

10:32.413 --> 10:33.562
Wow!

10:33.653 --> 10:36.121
- That's me?
- No. You're the dragon.

10:36.213 --> 10:37.931
(girl giggles)

10:38.013 --> 10:40.163
- Do you like it?
- I really like it.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.408
- Here.
- Thanks.

10:51.413 --> 10:54.291
Well, I'd better go get dressed.

10:54.693 --> 10:57.082
Yeah. You'll catch cold.

10:57.453 --> 10:58.488
Hey.

10:59.613 --> 11:02.605
You wanna go out with me tonight?

11:03.533 --> 11:06.252
- Yeah. Sure.
- Great!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.766
Um...

11:07.853 --> 11:10.048
Why don't you meet me here...

11:11.173 --> 11:15.564
...around eight?
901 Grand. It's right downtown.

11:16.253 --> 11:20.166
Who knows? Maybe you'll think
I'm sexier with my clothes on!

11:23.613 --> 11:25.808
- Thank you.
- Sure.

11:28.053 --> 11:30.044
Don't bet on it.

11:49.093 --> 11:50.572
Carl!

11:50.653 --> 11:52.644
Kinman!

11:54.093 --> 11:56.846
(Chinese) I have a little something for you.

12:07.933 --> 12:10.163
Oh, Tommy, this is beautiful!

12:10.253 --> 12:14.041
- Fifth-century Mongolian.
- Oh, I know. I know.

12:14.773 --> 12:17.082
It's good to have you back in LA.

12:17.173 --> 12:21.132
Carl, I want you to be extra careful
in the next few weeks, OK?

12:21.213 --> 12:23.488
Why?

12:23.573 --> 12:26.804
Serrano. He paid me a visit.

12:26.893 --> 12:31.091
Let me tell you something.
Serrano's got dick. He's broke.

12:31.173 --> 12:34.245
All his guys are in the pen. He's weak.

12:36.773 --> 12:38.889
I know he's weak.

12:38.973 --> 12:41.567
(Chinese) Just take care of business.
Things will be fine.

12:41.653 --> 12:44.213
I will. I will, Tommy.

13:34.573 --> 13:36.052
- Hi, Jake.
- How you doin'?

13:36.133 --> 13:38.488
Come in.

13:38.893 --> 13:41.566
For a minute I thought
I had the wrong address.

13:41.653 --> 13:43.723
No. This is the place.

13:43.813 --> 13:48.045
- This'll work. Yours?
- A businessman lets us use it.

13:50.773 --> 13:53.765
Ladies and gentlemen... Jake Lo.

13:53.853 --> 13:56.731
He was there, everybody.
He was in Tiananmen.

13:56.813 --> 14:00.249
His father was one of
the great martyrs of the cause.

14:02.013 --> 14:04.208
(mouths)

14:05.413 --> 14:06.766
Hi.

14:06.853 --> 14:10.448
I'm so glad you could make it, Jake.
How else could we get you here?

14:10.533 --> 14:13.172
Just wait a second. Listen to me.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.121
Please. We need money, Jake!

14:16.213 --> 14:19.523
Just a few words. No politics, no flag-waving.

14:19.613 --> 14:22.605
- Just the truth about what you saw.
- (man) Paul?

14:22.693 --> 14:25.207
This is our sponsor - Carl Chang.

14:25.293 --> 14:28.091
Jake. Great admirer of your father's.

14:29.373 --> 14:31.841
So what's in this for you, Mr Chang?

14:32.893 --> 14:35.885
Democracy. Capitalism. It's all a good cause.

14:37.693 --> 14:39.968
Well, uh, if you'll excuse me...

14:40.053 --> 14:43.728
Refreshments are upstairs.
It's a pleasure, Jake.

14:43.813 --> 14:48.933
All right, everyone! If you follow me,
I'll give you a tour of our operation.

14:49.933 --> 14:52.003
Come on, stay for one drink.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.127
Let me make it up to you.

15:00.093 --> 15:02.084
Well, you have something for me?

15:02.173 --> 15:04.971
The trucks will arrive in Chicago
ahead of schedule.

15:05.053 --> 15:08.090
Ahead of schedule? That's what I like to hear.

15:20.133 --> 15:22.124
Over there.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.412
We came down the chimney. Ho-ho-ho!

15:28.013 --> 15:29.651
Ho-ho.

15:34.093 --> 15:38.689
Your boss, that, uh...
ungrateful yellow bastard...

15:39.413 --> 15:42.723
...won't give me
what should be mine by rights.

15:43.733 --> 15:45.291
He says...

15:45.373 --> 15:49.605
(imitates accent)
"Oh, you got to be willing to take it."

15:49.973 --> 15:51.770
Well...

15:55.133 --> 15:57.124
I'm an American.

15:58.093 --> 16:00.891
And we know how to take things.

16:01.653 --> 16:05.282
I'm takin' your percentage
of the heroin business...

16:05.373 --> 16:07.603
...as of right now.

16:08.573 --> 16:10.962
You do not want to do this.

16:11.693 --> 16:15.049
- You can't do this!
- It's done.

16:15.133 --> 16:18.125
Give me your shipping manifests
and your books.

16:18.813 --> 16:20.804
Come on, come on, come on.

16:22.453 --> 16:24.489
Oh, that's a good boy.

16:25.093 --> 16:28.290
You goddamn Guinea bastard!

16:31.653 --> 16:32.722
Son of a bitch!

16:33.133 --> 16:34.407
He's mine!

16:36.893 --> 16:38.690
(screaming)

16:53.173 --> 16:54.606
Come on!

17:03.333 --> 17:04.288
Agh!

17:08.733 --> 17:11.406
Some Chink kid over there in a blackjacket!

17:11.492 --> 17:13.882
- He saw me whack Chang!
- You heard him! Move!

17:13.973 --> 17:18.171
You get to the front!
Angelo, get down from the goddamn roof!

17:19.772 --> 17:21.763
Come on. Give me your hand!

17:23.413 --> 17:25.404
(screams)

17:52.213 --> 17:54.010
Agh!

18:09.373 --> 18:12.012
Go down the stairs! You'll be OK. Go!

18:17.133 --> 18:19.010
Get me outta here.

18:19.093 --> 18:21.653
Black jacket across the kitchen-get him!

18:30.693 --> 18:31.682
(gun clicks)

18:31.773 --> 18:32.762
Shit!

18:53.333 --> 18:55.324
Son of a bitch!

19:11.173 --> 19:13.448
Whack him!

19:14.813 --> 19:16.132
Shit!

19:26.013 --> 19:28.004
(Jake yells)

19:48.773 --> 19:50.331
- Freeze!
- Hey!

19:50.413 --> 19:52.404
Hands on your head!

20:06.053 --> 20:11.047
- Gentlemen. Nathan Wesley, FBI.
- Morning.

20:11.133 --> 20:13.966
- Special Agents Stuart and Daniels.
- Hello.

20:14.053 --> 20:16.044
This is a local murder case.

20:16.133 --> 20:20.285
Carl Chang was the chief middleman
in the supply of heroin to the Chicago Mafia.

20:20.373 --> 20:23.968
- Who's this kid?
- Name is Jake Lo. Student, art major.

20:24.053 --> 20:27.443
- We wanna see him.
- This way.

20:27.533 --> 20:29.524
He's the only one who saw what went down.

20:29.613 --> 20:32.969
Father was career army, deceased.
Army intelligence.

20:33.053 --> 20:36.887
He was attached to the Beijing embassy
in '89 when the shit went down.

20:36.973 --> 20:39.089
Taught the martial arts at Langley.

20:39.173 --> 20:42.051
Wing chun, kung fu, mui tai.

20:46.853 --> 20:48.206
Great. More cops.

20:48.293 --> 20:51.808
- We're FBI. I'm Special Agent Wesley.
- Cops in suits.

20:51.893 --> 20:54.726
Seven bodies in the morgue,
13 in the hospital.

20:54.813 --> 20:58.010
You wanna take a look at the mug books?
Help us out!

21:01.533 --> 21:04.684
You know what I think?
Maybe this is the guy that did it.

21:06.653 --> 21:09.611
- The guy that did it needed a gun.
- Put that thing down!

21:10.893 --> 21:13.407
- Hey, hey! Take it easy.
- Shut up, Frank!

21:15.333 --> 21:18.006
Now look in the goddamn books.

21:18.093 --> 21:21.165
- He's not in the books.
- What makes you so sure?

21:23.533 --> 21:25.444
Look. Look.

21:25.813 --> 21:27.565
Serrano.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.484
- That's who shot Chang?
- Friend of yours?

21:33.213 --> 21:35.408
This is our break.

21:36.293 --> 21:38.761
How about giving Jake some space?

21:45.533 --> 21:47.569
Cigarette?

21:47.653 --> 21:51.612
In 48 hours, the grand jury
shuts down a three-year investigation...

21:51.693 --> 21:56.721
...into the Chicago branch of La Cosa Nostra,
of which Antonio Serrano is the boss.

21:57.333 --> 22:01.246
- Great. Keep the picture.
- Serrano must've taken this awful personal.

22:01.333 --> 22:04.609
I'll bet he hasn't pulled
a trigger himself in 15 years.

22:04.693 --> 22:07.048
That's right.

22:07.133 --> 22:10.489
And you, my friend, were there to see it.

22:10.573 --> 22:13.167
You're our prize witness.

22:16.533 --> 22:21.163
Look, all I wanted to do was clear myself.
If I'm not under arrest, I'm going home.

22:21.253 --> 22:23.642
You'll be under 24-hour FBI protection.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.725
A weekend in Chicago, first-class air, hotel.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.883
- No way!
- You'll cooperate...

22:28.973 --> 22:31.646
...or I'll bury your ass
in charges you can't spell.

22:31.733 --> 22:34.372
- What charges?
- How about assault and battery...

22:34.453 --> 22:36.683
...obstruction ofjustice, manslaughter?

22:36.773 --> 22:38.923
What judge is gonna buy that?

22:40.613 --> 22:42.604
My judge.

22:43.453 --> 22:45.808
(Stuart) Think it over, Jake.

22:45.893 --> 22:48.532
You wanna make the right decision.

22:49.413 --> 22:51.688
That's blackmail.

22:52.573 --> 22:55.645
That... is law enforcement.

23:37.493 --> 23:39.882
Where are they keepin' him?

23:39.973 --> 23:40.803
Yeah?

23:40.893 --> 23:44.852
(tape) He's broke.
All his guys are in the pen. He's weak.

23:44.933 --> 23:47.208
Tau to Chang to Serrano.

23:48.813 --> 23:50.565
Around the Horn.

23:50.653 --> 23:54.009
And last night
somebody took Chang out of the game.

23:54.093 --> 23:56.846
- What does that tell you?
- Eliminate the middleman.

23:56.933 --> 24:01.324
Somebody's going into business for
themselves. Something's coming down.

24:01.413 --> 24:03.483
My guy at the airportjust called.

24:03.573 --> 24:07.452
Well, Detective Withers,
my intelligence officer.

24:07.533 --> 24:11.321
- Lay some intelligence on me, will you?
- You used to be on top of things.

24:11.413 --> 24:13.404
- What have you got?
- A witness.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.961
And he's right here in Chicago.

24:16.053 --> 24:19.170
- Who, what, and where?
- Some kid, just flew in from LA.

24:19.253 --> 24:22.165
- Who's got him?
- The Feds.

24:23.453 --> 24:25.205
The Feds.

24:25.293 --> 24:29.286
Get off your asses!
Farris, pull these guys together. Move it!

24:31.253 --> 24:34.006
Go get yourself a bag of doughnuts.

24:56.213 --> 24:58.204
This way.

25:06.173 --> 25:11.566
Look, Jake... Any problems, you get nervous,
you need to talk, whatever...

25:11.653 --> 25:14.611
...you can reach me at this number.
- OK.

25:14.693 --> 25:17.924
- I need to call home.
- It's taken care of.

25:18.013 --> 25:20.652
Relax. Watch TV.

25:20.733 --> 25:23.247
- I'll see you in eight hours.
- OK.

25:24.493 --> 25:26.484
Daniels.

25:45.533 --> 25:47.091
(knocking)

25:47.173 --> 25:49.403
- Who is it?
- It's me. Daniels.

25:57.333 --> 26:00.131
- Anderson, this is Jake.
- Jake.

26:00.213 --> 26:03.205
- And this is Klein.
- Jake, welcome aboard.

26:05.413 --> 26:08.928
Well, it was a lousy flight.
Great hotel, though(!)

26:09.013 --> 26:11.481
- Glass of water?
- Help yourself.

26:23.253 --> 26:25.244
Pop-Tarts.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.687
More Pop-Tarts. This is good.

26:30.773 --> 26:33.731
- What are you doin', Jake?
- I'm hungry.

26:33.813 --> 26:36.964
We can send out for Chinese if you like.

26:38.213 --> 26:42.365
Eight hours alone with you guys?
Can I stand the excitement?

26:43.013 --> 26:45.447
I'm gonna see if there's a game on.

26:46.453 --> 26:48.489
Who else is testifying against this guy?

26:48.573 --> 26:52.452
Nobody's gonna testify against Serrano,
especially you, Jake.

26:52.773 --> 26:54.445
It's a low neighbourhood.

26:54.533 --> 26:57.445
Yeah, it's a low neighbourhood.

27:04.173 --> 27:05.686
Oh, shit.

27:05.773 --> 27:08.526
- Wrong place, wrong time.
- Yeah, Jake Lo...

27:08.853 --> 27:10.525
- Cop killer.
- Go, go.

27:21.213 --> 27:22.487
Ow!

27:33.133 --> 27:34.612
Ow!

27:35.373 --> 27:37.364
He broke my fuckin' nose!

27:50.573 --> 27:51.926
Son of a bitch!

27:52.573 --> 27:54.325
Agh!

28:01.093 --> 28:03.084
You're all done, Jake!

28:04.213 --> 28:05.202
Shit!

29:30.853 --> 29:33.083
- Don't move!
- No, it's OK!

29:33.173 --> 29:35.448
Drop your weapon now.

29:35.533 --> 29:39.242
- Listen, lady, you got the wrong guy!
- Shut up! Stay put.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.092
Release the hammer
and surrender your weapon.

29:50.173 --> 29:53.165
- I'm a cop!
- I said drop the gun!

29:53.253 --> 29:56.882
Daniels! FBI!
He just killed two federal officers!

29:56.973 --> 29:59.533
- Let me see that.
- Hey, watch it!

30:00.613 --> 30:04.322
- Let the girl go now!
- Goddamn it! He's trying to kill me!

30:04.413 --> 30:07.450
- Just do it!
- I didn't do anything!

30:08.493 --> 30:10.688
It's gonna be all right.

30:14.453 --> 30:16.091
Hold your fire!

30:24.613 --> 30:26.604
(phone rings)

30:28.613 --> 30:30.604
I'll get it.

30:33.973 --> 30:36.692
- Hello.
- Hi, Frank.

30:36.773 --> 30:39.287
- Jake?
- Yeah. Remember me?

30:40.293 --> 30:43.842
Jake, Jesus Christ! What happened?
What the hell is going on?

30:45.733 --> 30:48.805
(Serrano) You know
what's killing you in life, huh?

30:49.413 --> 30:52.769
Negative thinking. You gotta think positive.

30:54.373 --> 30:57.922
Like here in Chicago, we had that mayor...
whatshisname, you know.

30:58.013 --> 30:59.162
(phone rings)

30:59.253 --> 31:01.892
Everybody thinks
everything is going down the tubes.

31:01.973 --> 31:05.363
Bada-bing! He has a heart attack. He's dead.

31:05.453 --> 31:06.966
Think positive.

31:07.053 --> 31:10.648
This Tau... Everything looks terrible.
He's got us by the balls.

31:10.733 --> 31:13.805
Think positive. Cut off his hands.

31:13.893 --> 31:15.884
Mr Serrano, it's for you.

31:15.973 --> 31:20.171
I'm gonna have to insure that stomach
of yours with Lloyd's of London.

31:26.253 --> 31:28.244
Yeah?

31:30.053 --> 31:32.567
- The kid got away.
- He got away?

31:34.293 --> 31:37.922
Dammit! What do you mean he got away?
How did he get away?

31:38.933 --> 31:42.369
- Did they pop Klein?
- They killed Klein, but the kid got away.

31:42.453 --> 31:46.571
- We paid good money to them Feds.
- Don't worry. I have it wired.

31:47.453 --> 31:50.206
You better have it wired.
That kid saw everything.

31:50.293 --> 31:52.648
Too bad these wires ain't legit.

31:53.013 --> 31:56.847
He's meeting me at seven.
4th and Progress, the parking lot.

31:56.933 --> 32:00.005
There's a streetlight there.
You can't miss him.

32:00.093 --> 32:02.561
- We'll be there.
- I'm sure you will.

32:02.653 --> 32:06.089
Hey, you fuck this up again,
I'll blow your house up!

32:54.053 --> 32:55.771
Jake?

32:55.853 --> 32:57.844
Right here.

32:58.293 --> 33:00.648
Let's go. Come on.

33:06.053 --> 33:07.247
(tyres screech)

33:18.173 --> 33:21.245
If you wanna keep breathing, kid, don't move.

33:22.213 --> 33:25.091
- Freeze!
- I'm a cop. You freeze!

33:25.413 --> 33:28.769
- Stay the hell out of this.
- Figure it out.

33:28.853 --> 33:31.413
If this dickhead was
any kind of real FBI man...

33:31.493 --> 33:35.452
...two of his buddies dead,
he'd have offed you already himself.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.003
Who the hell is this guy, Jake?

33:44.093 --> 33:47.483
I'm your friend.
I've been through this with you.

33:48.133 --> 33:51.762
Now, just keep coming
and let's get you the hell out of here.

33:57.773 --> 33:59.365
(phone rings)

33:59.853 --> 34:01.332
Get down!

34:25.933 --> 34:27.411
Agh!

35:01.853 --> 35:04.321
- You're a slow learner, kid.
- (gunfire)

35:04.413 --> 35:06.688
Get your ass in here!

35:16.053 --> 35:18.044
Get your head down!

35:19.093 --> 35:20.606
Sons of bitches!

35:27.093 --> 35:29.243
Son of a bitch!

35:37.573 --> 35:39.564
Jesus Christ!

36:00.013 --> 36:01.207
(explosion)

36:01.293 --> 36:03.363
Hiya.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.365
Name's Ryan. Lieutenant Mace Ryan.

36:06.453 --> 36:08.330
Jake Lo.

36:08.413 --> 36:12.088
So tell me, Jake,
are you having a bad day or what?

36:24.813 --> 36:26.690
Everybody, listen up.

36:26.773 --> 36:30.049
Meet Jake Lo.
He's gonna give us Kinman Tau.

36:30.133 --> 36:33.648
Jake, this is Detective Farris.
Takes care of tactical surveillance.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.042
- Nice to meet you.
- Karla, meet Jake.

36:37.773 --> 36:40.128
We've met.

36:40.213 --> 36:43.330
- What the hell are you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?!

36:43.413 --> 36:46.530
This guy is all over the radio.
We've got to turn him over.

36:46.613 --> 36:49.081
Forget it. We are gonna get Tau!

36:51.613 --> 36:53.729
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

36:53.813 --> 36:56.202
I was going to identify
some guy named Serrano.

36:56.293 --> 36:58.284
Serrano is at war with Tau.

36:58.373 --> 37:01.126
Great! I hope they kill each other.

37:01.213 --> 37:03.204
I could not be that lucky.

37:03.293 --> 37:07.491
I've been after Tau for 10 years.
He's one of the largest producers of heroin.

37:07.573 --> 37:10.690
Chang was his No.1 distributor
till Serrano took him out.

37:10.773 --> 37:13.765
So what? What does this have to do with me?

37:15.453 --> 37:17.728
You are gonna help me nail him.

37:17.813 --> 37:19.246
Yeah.

37:19.333 --> 37:21.324
This is not my problem.

37:21.413 --> 37:24.564
Where you gonna go
with a gun at your head, huh?

37:24.653 --> 37:28.487
Every cop in this city's after you.
You're a cop killer. Know what that means?

37:28.573 --> 37:30.689
I'm off the department's Christmas list?

37:30.773 --> 37:34.527
Wise-ass. Step out on that street,
you'll last as long as a new Ferrari!

37:34.613 --> 37:36.046
It was self-defence!

37:36.133 --> 37:41.127
You think the first cop you run into
is gonna give you time to explain that?

37:41.213 --> 37:45.889
Don't forget about your friend
Antonio Serrano still looking for you.

37:50.053 --> 37:52.931
I'm your only ticket outta here, kid.

37:53.573 --> 37:57.202
So what do you want, cop?
How do I get off this ride?

37:59.893 --> 38:03.329
(Ryan) Cheer up, Jake.
You're doing a public service.

38:04.013 --> 38:07.050
Hell, you should be happy
to nail scum like Tau.

38:07.133 --> 38:09.249
Like I could give a shit.

38:09.333 --> 38:10.925
Yeah?

38:11.013 --> 38:14.642
I used to think like that too
when I was young, but things change.

38:14.733 --> 38:17.645
Been after this son of a bitch for 10 years.

38:17.733 --> 38:19.928
- Why?
- Why?

38:21.093 --> 38:25.132
- It's my job.
- Oh, Christ! Another hero.

38:27.053 --> 38:29.726
Mind if I take a little stab in the dark here?

38:30.333 --> 38:32.528
- Got a family?
- Yeah.

38:32.613 --> 38:35.446
You see 'em much? No, right?

38:35.533 --> 38:37.808
- I'm divorced.
- Yeah.

38:37.893 --> 38:40.691
And when you do see 'em,
you talk about yourjob.

38:40.773 --> 38:42.923
Only it's not ajob, it's a cause.

38:43.013 --> 38:46.972
It's this righteous cause
and it's more important than anything.

38:47.053 --> 38:50.125
- Well, how come that is?
- Listen, kid.

38:50.213 --> 38:53.011
Sooner or later, you gotta take a stand in life.

38:53.093 --> 38:57.848
You gotta care about something -
community, people, something.

39:00.133 --> 39:03.045
- You sound like my father.
- Yeah?

39:03.133 --> 39:06.967
Sounds like a pretty smart man.
Maybe I'll meet him sometime.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.613
Yeah. Maybe you will.

39:26.533 --> 39:29.491
Nice house on government pay, huh?

39:29.573 --> 39:33.361
He tells me to call him Frank,
like we're soul mates, the son of a bitch!

39:33.453 --> 39:36.968
I know you're pissed at this guy,
but keep yourself under control.

39:37.053 --> 39:39.613
This isn't some goddamn revenge thing, OK?

39:41.093 --> 39:44.688
- OK?
- Sure, Lieutenant. Anything you say.

39:44.773 --> 39:46.286
(doorbell)

39:51.613 --> 39:53.604
Hi, Frank.

39:58.733 --> 40:00.052
Agh!

40:03.853 --> 40:05.411
Shit.

40:05.933 --> 40:08.208
- Hey, come on.
- Oh, my God!

40:08.293 --> 40:11.968
- It's all right. I'm a police officer.
- It's all right, Lisa.

40:13.093 --> 40:15.812
We just wanna talk.

40:15.893 --> 40:19.090
It's all right. We'll be in the study.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.450
- What?
- Jesus.

40:28.453 --> 40:31.809
Have another drink. You're gonna need it.

40:31.893 --> 40:35.283
- Just read me my rights.
- I don't wanna arrest you, Frank.

40:35.373 --> 40:38.012
The man wants to be arrested.
I say arrest him.

40:38.093 --> 40:42.006
Jake! Why don't you take
those fists of fury of yours outside?

40:42.093 --> 40:44.766
- You're making the poor man nervous.
- Good.

40:44.853 --> 40:47.048
This poor man.

41:08.053 --> 41:11.966
He's meeting me at seven.
4th and Progress, the parking lot.

41:12.053 --> 41:15.284
There's a streetlight there.
You can't miss him.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.841
- We'll be there.
- I'm sure you will.

41:17.933 --> 41:21.164
You fuck this up again,
I'll blow your house up!

41:21.253 --> 41:24.051
Well... your wife's an attractive lady.

41:24.133 --> 41:28.046
I can't see her waiting around
for, what, say, 20 years or so?

41:30.173 --> 41:34.883
Now, on the other hand,
that shipment that Tau sent to Chicago...

41:36.413 --> 41:38.927
The trucks are on the way.

41:39.013 --> 41:41.732
I wanna know where and when.

41:43.053 --> 41:45.851
Serrano's the only one who knows that.

41:46.773 --> 41:51.688
And I never dealt with him directly.
I always went through Gazzi.

41:52.773 --> 41:55.162
Oh, he'll deal with you.

41:56.253 --> 41:58.369
He wants Jake.

42:00.773 --> 42:06.131
She pours it in. He tastes it. Says "Delicious".
Except it's not anisette, it's kerosene.

42:06.213 --> 42:08.727
- (phone rings)
- He says "Can I have another?"

42:08.813 --> 42:10.804
(laughter)

42:11.653 --> 42:13.086
Yeah?

42:13.173 --> 42:15.562
Go fuck yourself!
You got some explaining to do!

42:15.653 --> 42:17.644
Who is that?

42:18.053 --> 42:20.044
It's, uh... Stuart, the Fed.

42:20.133 --> 42:24.172
He says he'll only talk to you.
I told him to go fuck himself.

42:26.973 --> 42:29.168
Let me talk to him.

42:35.413 --> 42:36.971
What happened, Frank?

42:37.053 --> 42:39.362
- It was a bust.
- No kidding.

42:39.453 --> 42:43.731
Some cop walked right into it. What are
the odds against that? A thousand to one?

42:43.813 --> 42:48.762
Hey, Frank, if I want odds, I got bookies.
Tell me something I don't know.

42:49.013 --> 42:53.211
I have him.
Chicago cops can be very reasonable.

42:53.733 --> 42:57.328
- It cost me, but I have him.
- Don't worry about what it cost.

42:57.413 --> 43:01.406
- You bring him over...
- Tell him you can't risk it tonight.

43:01.493 --> 43:03.802
OK, Frank? OK?

43:03.893 --> 43:07.442
This kid is a third-degree burn right now
because of your guys.

43:07.533 --> 43:11.526
They fucked up, not me.
I'm not going anywhere tonight.

43:11.613 --> 43:15.925
Who said anything about tonight?
Bring him over tomorrow.

43:16.013 --> 43:18.652
That way it's nice and clean.
Do you understand?

43:18.733 --> 43:21.770
I'm only gonna give him up
if you're there personally.

43:21.853 --> 43:24.492
Where am I gonna go? Florida?

43:32.573 --> 43:34.291
It's OK.

43:41.373 --> 43:43.967
This is Serrano's restaurant. He sits here.

43:44.053 --> 43:49.047
Every afternoon, 2.30, he pours himself
a sweet vermouth and watches the soaps.

43:50.893 --> 43:53.123
You really know this guy.

43:53.213 --> 43:55.443
I know all about you, too.

43:55.533 --> 43:58.525
I know about Beijing,
about Tiananmen Square.

43:59.653 --> 44:04.932
You were three days late paying your last
Visa bill and you got a B minus in biology.

44:05.253 --> 44:07.687
Yeah? So?

44:07.773 --> 44:09.764
I got screwed on the midterm.

44:13.853 --> 44:16.811
Look, I'm sorry about before.

44:16.893 --> 44:20.124
- There was a lot happening...
- It's OK.

44:21.613 --> 44:23.968
Forget it.

44:25.573 --> 44:29.168
Pay attention. Here's the plan for tomorrow.
This is the fire exit.

44:29.253 --> 44:31.813
When the tear gas goes off,
you get out this way.

44:31.893 --> 44:36.523
Sharpshooters will cover you.
Then duck out behind this back alley.

44:40.613 --> 44:44.765
- I could get killed in there, couldn't I?
- You've got to trust Ryan.

44:44.853 --> 44:49.131
He would not send a civilian in there
if he thought he couldn't control it.

44:49.213 --> 44:51.727
Army intelligence told my dad
the same thing.

44:51.813 --> 44:54.202
He came home in a box.

44:54.293 --> 44:56.807
I never even knew why we were over there.

44:56.893 --> 44:59.771
They've been promising
to show me his military file.

44:59.853 --> 45:03.766
I haven't seen shit.
That's the way these guys are.

45:03.853 --> 45:06.083
So don't talk about trusting Ryan.

45:06.173 --> 45:09.722
Sounds like you hate him
because he reminds you of your father.

45:09.813 --> 45:12.725
You don't know anything
about my father, OK?

45:12.813 --> 45:16.249
My father never got anyone else killed.

45:59.653 --> 46:01.609
Sit down.

46:01.693 --> 46:03.490
You're wired for sound, my man.

46:03.573 --> 46:07.930
All right, now. The clear signal is
"Nice doing business with you."

46:08.013 --> 46:09.651
- We hear that, we're in.
- Right.

46:09.733 --> 46:13.203
After this, you get me squared
with the locals and I go home, right?

46:13.293 --> 46:17.411
That's a deal. I get when and where
on the shipment from Tau...

46:17.493 --> 46:20.724
...and you get a free ticket
back to bikinis and palm trees.

46:20.813 --> 46:22.804
(speaks Chinese)

46:23.573 --> 46:24.722
What did you say?

46:24.813 --> 46:28.806
(both speak Chinese)

46:30.213 --> 46:32.568
He says he thinks he's in love with you.

46:32.653 --> 46:34.848
Get in line.

46:36.133 --> 46:37.930
Move out, Jake.

46:38.013 --> 46:40.243
Get him to the car.

46:40.333 --> 46:42.449
Jake, move it.

46:44.853 --> 46:48.402
Remember, Frank, the signal is
"Nice doing business with you."

46:48.493 --> 46:51.724
This is wound way too tight.
Someone so much as sneezes...

46:51.813 --> 46:54.247
I know you got the hots for him, but...

46:54.333 --> 46:57.166
- I'm talking business...
- So am l, dammit!

46:57.253 --> 47:00.051
You're my intelligence officer!
Try showing some...

47:00.133 --> 47:03.011
...by getting your ass across the street!

47:30.893 --> 47:35.444
I want you to know, Jake, that I'm the only
one who did this to myself and to you.

47:35.533 --> 47:39.128
I want you to know that I take responsibility
for my personal actions.

47:40.053 --> 47:42.408
This isn't EST, Frank.

47:44.293 --> 47:47.808
Mr Serrano's waiting. Inside.

47:54.693 --> 47:58.481
Skirmish teams one through four,
give me the high sign if ready. Over.

48:25.813 --> 48:27.769
Look at this.

48:28.053 --> 48:30.203
The FBI always gets its man.

48:30.293 --> 48:32.568
Serrano's got religion.

48:32.653 --> 48:35.247
Give me the word
and I'll send him to his maker.

48:35.333 --> 48:36.766
Hold your fire.

48:36.853 --> 48:40.289
Switch him off only
on the Lieutenant's signal. Copy?

48:40.373 --> 48:41.806
Copy that.

49:00.493 --> 49:02.688
Have I ever let you down?

49:04.293 --> 49:07.410
- I have something to talk to you about.
- Wait a second.

49:07.493 --> 49:09.882
Pleasure before business.

49:11.133 --> 49:13.408
You saw me clip that guy...
What was his name?

49:13.493 --> 49:15.529
- Ching... Chung...
- Chang.

49:15.613 --> 49:19.049
You know what I heard?
I heard he wasn't dead.

49:19.133 --> 49:22.409
He was 18 hours in the hospital
before he died.

49:22.493 --> 49:26.964
The cops kept asking who did it,
but there wasn't enough left of him to say.

49:27.053 --> 49:30.489
He could scream, though. Aw... agh!

49:30.573 --> 49:32.564
More or less.

49:33.253 --> 49:36.325
- You saw me, right?
- I saw you.

49:38.853 --> 49:41.128
Look at that, huh? Look at that posture.

49:41.493 --> 49:43.165
Bad posture.

49:43.253 --> 49:46.848
That's the root
of every health problem in America.

49:52.653 --> 49:54.644
You know what I'm gonna do?

49:56.933 --> 50:00.562
I'm gonna break your hands, finger by finger.

50:00.653 --> 50:04.805
And then I'm gonna break your ribs,
rib by rib.

50:04.893 --> 50:07.453
Then I'm gonna break your legs.

50:07.533 --> 50:09.967
- Knock yourself out.
- Jesus, kid!

50:10.733 --> 50:12.610
Knock yourself out?

50:12.693 --> 50:14.604
Mr Serrano, excuse me.

50:14.693 --> 50:18.129
With all respect, I gotta get downtown.

50:18.453 --> 50:20.330
We had an understanding.

50:22.613 --> 50:24.808
I'll get back to him later.

50:33.133 --> 50:35.328
Put it right here.

50:40.773 --> 50:43.651
There. You just got sex appeal.

50:44.013 --> 50:45.207
Come on, Frank!

50:48.053 --> 50:50.487
I have another deal for you.

50:50.573 --> 50:53.167
Could we talk... you know, privately?

50:53.813 --> 50:55.804
What's on your mind?

50:59.093 --> 51:01.607
- The Bureau knows about...
- Sh!

51:01.693 --> 51:03.285
Come on. Let's talk.

51:03.373 --> 51:07.286
The Bureau knows about
your heroin shipment.

51:08.933 --> 51:11.686
- And what's your end?
- Say, 100K off the top.

51:12.013 --> 51:14.004
Frank.

51:14.093 --> 51:16.926
Frank, Frank, Frank.

51:17.493 --> 51:20.246
Tomorrow night. Monarch Linen, Chinatown.

51:21.813 --> 51:23.292
Yes!

51:23.373 --> 51:26.729
- What time?
- Midnight.

51:27.413 --> 51:29.131
Just one thing.

51:29.213 --> 51:33.491
You guarantee no cops, no Feds,
and I give you nothing.

51:33.573 --> 51:35.609
No 100 grand. Zip.

51:36.013 --> 51:39.608
You do it as a favour for me, for free.

51:39.693 --> 51:41.365
OK, Mr Serrano.

51:42.373 --> 51:45.126
- Tony.
- Yeah, Tony.

51:47.413 --> 51:49.722
Thanks again for this, huh?

51:51.093 --> 51:53.084
That's the thing about
doing business with you, Frank.

51:53.173 --> 51:54.845
(static)

51:54.933 --> 51:55.922
Shit!

51:56.013 --> 51:58.402
- What's the matter?
- We lost Stuart's mike.

51:59.253 --> 52:01.608
Any time, Tony.

52:01.693 --> 52:04.207
Nice doing business with you.

52:04.293 --> 52:06.409
- Hey, Frank.
- Yeah?

52:06.813 --> 52:09.202
Why'd you say you'd do it for free?

52:11.013 --> 52:13.288
Nice doing business with you.

52:14.973 --> 52:19.842
- Nice doing business with you, Tony.
- Yeah. Nice doing business with you.

52:20.413 --> 52:24.326
You know, the only time
a man doesn't want any money...

52:25.253 --> 52:28.370
...is when he wants somethin' else.
- Hey!

52:28.973 --> 52:30.565
You're sweatin' like a pig.

52:30.653 --> 52:33.770
All he wants to do
is get outta here in one piece.

52:35.133 --> 52:36.930
No, Tony...

52:37.013 --> 52:38.162
Son of a bitch!

52:41.373 --> 52:43.045
Move in! Move in!

52:43.133 --> 52:45.124
Go! Go! Go! We're movin'!

52:50.053 --> 52:53.648
Stand him up straight.
Stand him up straight!

52:55.213 --> 52:57.204
Come on! Move! Move! Move!

52:57.453 --> 52:59.842
- We got cops out here!
- How many?

52:59.933 --> 53:01.889
Cops?!

53:02.253 --> 53:04.369
Get the cars! Get the hell outta here!

53:04.453 --> 53:06.364
Take your shot! Take your shot!

53:06.453 --> 53:09.092
- Lost the shot.
- Two, take him!

53:09.173 --> 53:12.483
Negative. Target not clear.
No shot. No shot.

53:36.213 --> 53:38.204
Son of a bitch!

54:10.133 --> 54:12.169
Fucking kid!

54:38.613 --> 54:39.966
Fuck!

55:08.533 --> 55:11.809
Ryan! Jake never came out.

55:11.893 --> 55:14.327
I know! What the fuck do you want me to do?!

55:18.173 --> 55:20.403
Michael!

55:43.653 --> 55:46.042
Kill that fuckin' kid.

56:11.733 --> 56:13.485
Second wave! Second wave!

56:23.773 --> 56:25.684
Go! Go!

56:27.893 --> 56:29.326
Get over there!

56:40.973 --> 56:42.326
Agh!

57:11.733 --> 57:13.849
OK... OK.

57:13.933 --> 57:15.924
I'll make you a deal.

57:17.613 --> 57:20.047
What I gave Stuart... you can have that.

57:20.133 --> 57:22.488
It's not good enough.

57:22.573 --> 57:25.406
That's 25 grand!
What the fuck's the matter with you?

57:25.493 --> 57:28.053
OK. All right. What do you want, huh?

57:30.573 --> 57:34.771
You didn't hear nothin'.
You didn't see nothin'.

57:34.853 --> 57:37.287
I'll give you all the money you want.

57:37.853 --> 57:39.844
Tony...

57:41.973 --> 57:47.127
The only time a man doesn't want money
is if he wants somethin' else.

57:47.213 --> 57:49.204
You're sweatin' like a pig.

57:49.293 --> 57:52.126
All he wants is to get out in one piece.

57:53.373 --> 57:55.364
Not the face.

58:18.813 --> 58:22.010
- Nice plan, Lieutenant.
- Jesus Christ!

58:22.333 --> 58:24.528
Real smooth.

58:26.093 --> 58:28.402
Gimme a hand.

58:28.493 --> 58:30.370
Fuck you.

58:30.453 --> 58:33.570
Steve, take this piece of shit and book him.

58:34.053 --> 58:36.521
I hear they need
a police commissioner in Beirut.

58:36.613 --> 58:39.002
What's your problem, kid?

58:40.133 --> 58:44.365
- We had a deal, right?
- (tape)... he got away? How did he get away?

58:44.453 --> 58:48.207
- Did they pop Klein?
- They killed Klein, but the kid got away.

58:48.293 --> 58:52.286
- We paid good money to them Feds.
- Don't worry. I have it wired.

58:52.373 --> 58:55.331
You better have it wired.
That kid saw everything.

58:55.413 --> 58:56.892
(tape off)

58:56.973 --> 58:59.362
The Feds got a copy of this tape.

59:00.093 --> 59:03.130
- You're clear, just like I said.
- You son of a bitch.

59:03.893 --> 59:07.488
Why didn't you use that tape before?

59:07.573 --> 59:09.962
I needed you.

59:11.453 --> 59:13.842
Look, this is a war, kid.

59:13.933 --> 59:16.686
There's no sideline.
You're on one side or the other.

59:16.773 --> 59:20.732
Maybe it's time you asked yourself
what your little war costs.

59:21.293 --> 59:23.443
Whatever it takes.

59:30.493 --> 59:32.882
- Lieutenant?
- Ah, forget it.

59:39.293 --> 59:42.205
- Now we get Tau.
- It ain't over.

59:42.293 --> 59:44.284
Get in the fuckin' car.

59:44.373 --> 59:47.092
Jake! Where are you going?

59:47.173 --> 59:50.324
"Whatever it takes"?
I'm so tired of that bullshit.

59:50.413 --> 59:53.564
"Whatever it takes"
is something that happens to somebody else.

59:53.653 --> 59:57.771
- He's still the best cop I've ever known.
- You need to get out more.

59:59.253 --> 01:00:03.292
Jake, the next flight to LA
doesn't leave for another four hours.

01:00:03.373 --> 01:00:06.809
I've had enough police protection,
Detective Withers.

01:00:06.893 --> 01:00:10.522
What if told you I had something
you'd like to get your hands on?

01:00:10.613 --> 01:00:14.288
- Excuse me?
- I have your dad's file.

01:00:14.773 --> 01:00:18.402
He's got some brass. You gotta give him that.

01:00:19.693 --> 01:00:22.605
Welcome back, Mr Serrano.

01:00:22.693 --> 01:00:25.127
- After you.
- No. After you, Mr Serrano.

01:00:26.973 --> 01:00:29.771
- How's the missis?
- The missis, she's fine.

01:00:29.853 --> 01:00:31.969
Yeah? That's good.

01:00:32.053 --> 01:00:33.327
Fuckin' kid.

01:00:33.413 --> 01:00:35.927
Fuckin' kid broke my fuckin' nose!

01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:44.244
Where did you get this?

01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:46.972
I told you. Some friends
in the Federal building.

01:00:47.053 --> 01:00:50.125
You better call 'em back.
They didn't get everything.

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:52.852
What did you think you were gonna find?

01:00:52.933 --> 01:00:55.128
I don't know. Nothing.

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:02.244
You're welcome.

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:05.131
This wasn't an easy thing to get, you know.

01:01:05.213 --> 01:01:07.443
Well, then, why'd you do it?

01:01:08.053 --> 01:01:10.248
- Excuse me?
- Everybody wants something...

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.642
...especially a 24-hour-a-day cop.

01:01:13.573 --> 01:01:15.609
You're really asking why I did this?

01:01:15.693 --> 01:01:19.971
When are Lieutenant Ryan and his wish list
coming through the door?

01:01:20.053 --> 01:01:22.647
You asshole!

01:01:22.733 --> 01:01:25.770
I read the file, Jake.

01:01:27.813 --> 01:01:30.327
Your father was doing
what he thought was right...

01:01:30.413 --> 01:01:33.166
...and he died.

01:01:33.253 --> 01:01:35.562
It happens every day.

01:01:35.653 --> 01:01:38.042
Deal with it.

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:44.963
Dad! We have to get outta here!

01:01:45.053 --> 01:01:48.170
Jake! Jake, get out now!

01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:53.605
If I only could have...
I was 10 feet from him when the tank...

01:01:54.653 --> 01:01:56.723
...when he died.

01:01:58.693 --> 01:02:01.127
Everybody dies.

01:02:02.773 --> 01:02:05.685
But he died for something he believed in.

01:02:07.093 --> 01:02:09.288
You're alive, Jake.

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:13.722
You've gotta let him go.

01:02:15.373 --> 01:02:17.364
I know.

01:02:18.213 --> 01:02:20.204
I miss him.

01:02:21.413 --> 01:02:23.973
("Can't Find My Way" by Hardline)

01:02:27.733 --> 01:02:30.964
 Here comes that feelin'

01:02:31.413 --> 01:02:36.168
 Burnin'in my heart again

01:02:41.973 --> 01:02:45.329
 And why's it comin'back

01:02:46.213 --> 01:02:50.411
 Back to haunt me again?

01:02:52.013 --> 01:02:54.004
 Yeah

01:02:55.573 --> 01:02:58.770
 Well, I can't stand it

01:02:59.173 --> 01:03:02.643
 It hurts me blind

01:03:02.733 --> 01:03:05.167
 Whatever I can see

01:03:05.933 --> 01:03:09.846
 You appear on my mind

01:03:09.933 --> 01:03:11.810
 Without you

01:03:11.893 --> 01:03:16.091
 I can't find my way

01:03:16.173 --> 01:03:18.243
 Yeah

01:03:18.853 --> 01:03:23.768
 I can't find my way

01:03:23.853 --> 01:03:26.162
 Yeah, yeah

01:03:26.253 --> 01:03:28.642
 All those stormy nights

01:03:28.733 --> 01:03:32.612
 Can't wash away the pain

01:03:33.253 --> 01:03:37.485
 I can't find my way

01:03:37.573 --> 01:03:39.928
 Yeah

01:03:40.693 --> 01:03:44.811
 Nobody told me it would be easy

01:03:46.253 --> 01:03:49.529
 Oh, life, they say

01:03:49.613 --> 01:03:53.492
 Can't always please me, yeah

01:03:54.973 --> 01:03:56.964
 Well, I can't look back

01:03:58.053 --> 01:04:02.046
 Now that she's gone

01:04:20.013 --> 01:04:24.484
 I can't find my way

01:04:24.573 --> 01:04:26.564
 Yeah

01:04:27.293 --> 01:04:32.367
 I can't find my way...

01:04:35.733 --> 01:04:37.724
Jesus Christ!

01:04:40.693 --> 01:04:42.684
Goddamn you guys!

01:04:43.973 --> 01:04:45.964
Shit!

01:04:53.533 --> 01:04:55.489
(pounding on door)

01:04:55.573 --> 01:04:57.643
Withers!

01:04:57.733 --> 01:05:00.167
- Open up. It's Ryan.
- Ryan?

01:05:01.213 --> 01:05:02.771
Oh, great.

01:05:04.093 --> 01:05:07.244
Come on. I need to talk to you.
Open the damn door.

01:05:08.853 --> 01:05:10.844
Just a minute.

01:05:11.973 --> 01:05:14.168
Just get in there.

01:05:16.573 --> 01:05:18.370
Jesus.

01:05:19.733 --> 01:05:24.284
- What happened to you?
- Tau had Serrano killed in his cell last night.

01:05:24.373 --> 01:05:26.364
What?

01:05:26.853 --> 01:05:30.641
Now he is laughing his ass off
over a half a ton of smack.

01:05:32.973 --> 01:05:36.204
- You went to the laundry.
- Yeah, I went to the laundry.

01:05:36.293 --> 01:05:38.853
Took it apart. Not a goddamn thing!

01:05:39.173 --> 01:05:41.403
I know it's there. I can smell it!

01:05:46.093 --> 01:05:49.324
Maybe if I had a man on the inside.
I don't know.

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:52.530
- What about Farris?
- Nah. They know Farris.

01:05:53.613 --> 01:05:58.209
It doesn't matter anyway.
Tomorrow I'm gonna be back on foot patrol.

01:05:58.293 --> 01:06:02.081
- It's just a waste of time.
- It's just time, Mace.

01:06:02.613 --> 01:06:05.685
It is just 10 years of my life wasted!

01:06:07.053 --> 01:06:08.884
Flushed!

01:06:08.973 --> 01:06:11.168
And for what?

01:06:11.573 --> 01:06:14.690
- For what's right.
- Yeah?

01:06:15.213 --> 01:06:17.966
What is right, Karla? Huh?

01:06:18.453 --> 01:06:21.650
I stood there last night
staring at that son of a bitch...

01:06:21.733 --> 01:06:23.883
...and I couldn't even spoon out...

01:06:23.973 --> 01:06:28.012
...this one worthless piece of wormshit,
Kinman Tommy Tau!

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:39.288
At least I didn't get that kid killed.

01:06:39.373 --> 01:06:42.171
You mean Jake.

01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:46.924
Yeah.

01:06:48.733 --> 01:06:51.566
I like that kid.

01:06:51.653 --> 01:06:54.213
Maybe you should have told him.

01:06:54.293 --> 01:06:57.569
I don't have to say somethin' like that.

01:06:57.653 --> 01:06:59.644
He knows.

01:07:01.973 --> 01:07:03.964
He knows.

01:07:05.933 --> 01:07:07.924
Hey, Mace.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:13.129
- We're still gonna get Tau, right?
- Yeah, right.

01:07:13.213 --> 01:07:16.364
Maybe he'll give us both ajob in his laundry.

01:07:59.453 --> 01:08:01.444
(man) About time!

01:08:07.413 --> 01:08:09.404
(door opens)

01:08:22.453 --> 01:08:24.523
I'll be goddamned.

01:09:20.252 --> 01:09:22.608
- You ready?
- Ready.

01:09:22.693 --> 01:09:25.082
Let's get you wired.

01:09:34.853 --> 01:09:37.287
Come here. Hitch your shirt up.

01:09:45.453 --> 01:09:48.171
How does this feel? Is this comfortable?

01:09:48.252 --> 01:09:51.086
- Feels like a gun in my back.
- Yeah. (laughs)

01:09:51.173 --> 01:09:54.085
Good. Maybe that'll keep you
on your toes. Withers?

01:09:54.413 --> 01:09:57.007
Withers, go ahead.

01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:59.323
Workers going in now.

01:10:02.773 --> 01:10:04.764
All right, now listen.

01:10:04.853 --> 01:10:08.892
Remember the names I gave you -
your family back home, friends.

01:10:08.973 --> 01:10:12.648
- Anybody stops you...
- Hit 'em with the names. I know.

01:10:12.733 --> 01:10:17.409
Look, it's just you and me here. As far as
the department's concerned, I'm fishing.

01:10:17.493 --> 01:10:19.211
I got it.

01:10:19.293 --> 01:10:22.922
You run into any trouble, you bail.
You listenin' to me?

01:10:23.773 --> 01:10:26.128
- Relax.
- Yeah, right.

01:10:26.213 --> 01:10:28.602
I'm very relaxed.

01:10:32.253 --> 01:10:34.244
Go.

01:10:34.653 --> 01:10:37.770
- Uh... Jake.
- Yeah?

01:10:40.013 --> 01:10:42.004
l, uh...

01:10:43.293 --> 01:10:44.806
Uh...

01:10:49.013 --> 01:10:51.208
- You know...
- Yeah.

01:10:51.893 --> 01:10:54.282
You don't have to say it.

01:10:56.893 --> 01:10:58.884
Thank God.

01:11:36.253 --> 01:11:38.847
(Chinese) Wait! Who are you, asshole?

01:11:38.933 --> 01:11:42.164
(Chinese) Hong Wong, Kim Wong's brother.
Wang Cho promised me this job.

01:11:42.253 --> 01:11:44.403
Shut up! Speak English!

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.446
(Chinese) Thank you. Thank you.

01:11:46.533 --> 01:11:48.489
(Chinese) Shut up. Back to work.

01:12:00.693 --> 01:12:04.527
(Chinese) Hey, you! Don't unload here.
Go back and get another cart.

01:12:04.613 --> 01:12:07.446
Go and get another cart! Another cart!

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:32.324
Ryan... Ryan.

01:12:34.533 --> 01:12:36.091
Withers, go ahead.

01:12:40.813 --> 01:12:42.804
Withers?

01:12:44.013 --> 01:12:45.002
Shit.

01:13:04.733 --> 01:13:08.089
- Ryan.
- Jake, get out of there fast.

01:13:08.173 --> 01:13:11.768
- Gotta get out now!
- I think it comes out of the sheets.

01:13:18.893 --> 01:13:20.565
Ryan.

01:13:20.853 --> 01:13:22.650
Ryan!

01:13:23.653 --> 01:13:25.644
Shit.

01:14:05.253 --> 01:14:07.483
The two cops are coming.

01:14:14.053 --> 01:14:16.044
(speaking Chinese)

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:41.445
(speaking Chinese)

01:14:45.533 --> 01:14:47.046
So...

01:14:47.133 --> 01:14:50.489
Looks like you finally figured me out, Ryan.

01:14:51.173 --> 01:14:53.687
Funny, Serrano thought the same thing.

01:14:55.093 --> 01:14:59.211
Now, don't be stupid, Tommy.
I got backup all over the street.

01:14:59.293 --> 01:15:01.648
SWAT, helicopters.

01:15:01.733 --> 01:15:04.088
You won't get 10 feet outside that door.

01:15:05.933 --> 01:15:08.766
(Tau) You're stupid! You come here alone!

01:15:08.853 --> 01:15:11.890
You have no backup. Alone with just this girl!

01:15:11.973 --> 01:15:14.692
What's happening?
You were a good adversary...

01:15:14.773 --> 01:15:17.333
...but you're getting very sloppy!

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:20.202
Cut the bullshit, Tommy boy!

01:15:20.733 --> 01:15:25.409
You make it sound like we've been
playing chess for the last 10 years.

01:15:25.493 --> 01:15:27.882
Hey! I'm a cop...

01:15:27.973 --> 01:15:30.009
...and you're a piece of shit.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:32.482
That's the story.

01:15:33.053 --> 01:15:37.205
I've never killed a cop.
Thought it was bad for business.

01:15:37.293 --> 01:15:40.365
Now... I'm gonna have to kill two.

01:15:42.173 --> 01:15:45.563
Remember this, Ryan. This is all your doing.

01:15:48.333 --> 01:15:50.005
(Jake yells)

01:15:54.573 --> 01:15:56.768
Took your fuckin' time!

01:16:04.613 --> 01:16:06.604
(shouts in Chinese)

01:16:33.573 --> 01:16:35.211
Agh!

01:16:38.013 --> 01:16:39.048
Ryan!

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:48.244
- Jesus, Mace!
- Jesus, Ryan!

01:16:49.093 --> 01:16:51.163
I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:16:51.253 --> 01:16:53.528
Get Tau!

01:16:53.613 --> 01:16:55.444
Go, goddamn it!

01:16:55.533 --> 01:16:58.445
- Get him outta here.
- Come on, Mace. Come on!

01:16:58.693 --> 01:17:00.923
You gotta back him up. Here.

01:17:01.013 --> 01:17:03.243
Don't be stupid! Come on!

01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:05.688
Do yourjob, dammit!

01:17:16.093 --> 01:17:18.084
Just get the...

01:17:24.813 --> 01:17:26.565
...motherf...

01:17:29.893 --> 01:17:31.884
(speaks Chinese)

01:17:48.213 --> 01:17:49.965
(shouting in Chinese)

01:21:57.613 --> 01:21:59.604
Who the fuck are you?

01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:02.364
You a cop?

01:22:03.573 --> 01:22:05.803
What do you want from me? Money?

01:23:08.653 --> 01:23:10.291
(train hoots)

01:23:29.013 --> 01:23:30.207
Agh!

01:23:42.413 --> 01:23:44.404
(siren)

01:23:46.053 --> 01:23:48.044
(coughing)

01:23:54.413 --> 01:23:56.643
- Jake!
- Karla!

01:23:59.453 --> 01:24:02.013
He's still in there. He never came out.

01:24:02.093 --> 01:24:04.687
- Where is he?
- He's in there! He never came out!

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:06.968
He said he was gonna come out!

01:24:07.053 --> 01:24:09.044
I'm goin' in!

01:24:10.973 --> 01:24:12.406
Jake!

01:24:34.293 --> 01:24:37.091
Ryan!

01:24:38.293 --> 01:24:40.932
Jake, get out! Get out now!

01:24:42.853 --> 01:24:45.970
Ryan!

01:24:53.693 --> 01:24:55.445
Kid!

01:25:01.413 --> 01:25:04.883
Hey, lady, you gotta come on
and get behind the lines.

01:25:15.293 --> 01:25:16.646
Medic!

01:25:17.453 --> 01:25:18.852
Go! Go! Go!

01:25:33.213 --> 01:25:35.408
Easy now, Mace.

01:25:35.493 --> 01:25:38.803
- Tau?
- He's at one with his ancestors.

01:25:39.173 --> 01:25:41.368
Good.

01:25:41.453 --> 01:25:44.490
You don't go halfway, do you, kid?

01:25:44.573 --> 01:25:46.962
I had a good teacher.

01:25:48.733 --> 01:25:50.724
Hey, Jake...

01:25:51.293 --> 01:25:53.682
- About Withers.
- Yeah?

01:25:53.773 --> 01:25:54.888
Shut up.

01:25:54.973 --> 01:25:57.441
She's just using you to get to me.

01:25:59.693 --> 01:26:02.082
You're a real case, Ryan.

01:26:03.213 --> 01:26:05.602
150 proof, kid.

01:26:10.293 --> 01:26:12.682
See you around, Jake.

01:26:13.613 --> 01:26:15.365
It'll be all right, Mace.

01:26:16.613 --> 01:26:17.762
One, two, three...

01:26:17.853 --> 01:26:19.844
(Ryan) Sons of bitches!

01:26:24.773 --> 01:26:27.207
- Are you?
- What?

01:26:27.813 --> 01:26:30.008
Using me to get to him.

01:26:30.973 --> 01:26:32.691
Absolutely.

01:26:32.773 --> 01:26:34.764
(man) Hey, you in or out?

01:26:35.733 --> 01:26:37.928
We're in.

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:48.482
("I'll Be There" by Hardline)

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:07.405
 I know how you feel, girl,
Been there many times before

01:27:07.853 --> 01:27:11.732
 When I've gotta pick up
and walk it out the door

01:27:12.613 --> 01:27:16.208
 Sometimes hopin'is all that we can do

01:27:17.093 --> 01:27:21.211
 In mind and spirit, girl,
I'm always there for you

01:27:22.653 --> 01:27:25.611
 Every time I think about

01:27:26.053 --> 01:27:29.523
 The way it's got to be

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:34.764
 You know someday we will work it out

01:27:35.413 --> 01:27:38.211
 When all that we wished for

01:27:38.293 --> 01:27:40.966
 Is just a memory

01:27:41.533 --> 01:27:45.890
 Any time you need me, I'll be there

01:27:46.333 --> 01:27:48.403
 Any time at all

01:27:48.493 --> 01:27:50.882
 Just say the word

01:27:50.973 --> 01:27:55.444
 Just you say the word and I'll be there

01:27:55.773 --> 01:27:59.561
 Any time you need me, girl, I will be there

01:27:59.653 --> 01:28:01.405
 The nights seem longer

01:28:01.493 --> 01:28:04.087
 The days feel just the same

01:28:04.173 --> 01:28:08.086
 Well, a little more lonelier than yesterday

01:28:09.253 --> 01:28:13.326
 Sometimes words ain't easy to explain

01:28:14.013 --> 01:28:17.688
 Whether I'm here or gone,
the feelings stay the same

01:28:17.773 --> 01:28:19.252
 Oh, yeah

01:28:19.333 --> 01:28:22.370
 Every time I think about

01:28:22.853 --> 01:28:26.482
 The way it's got to be

01:28:28.253 --> 01:28:32.007
 You know someday we will work it all out

01:28:32.093 --> 01:28:34.971
 When all that we wished for

01:28:35.053 --> 01:28:38.284
 Is just a memory

01:28:38.373 --> 01:28:42.605
 Any time you need me, I'll be there

01:28:43.013 --> 01:28:45.083
 Any time at all

01:28:45.173 --> 01:28:47.641
 Just say the word

01:28:47.733 --> 01:28:52.045
 Just you say the word and I'll be there

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:54.802
 Any time you need me, girl

01:28:54.893 --> 01:28:56.724
 I will be there
