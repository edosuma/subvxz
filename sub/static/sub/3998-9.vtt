00:01.908 --> 00:02.857
Oh, hey.

00:02.892 --> 00:04.757
I was wondering
about date night tonight.

00:04.792 --> 00:07.497
Do you wanna just stay in?
'Cause you know what that means.

00:07.532 --> 00:09.753
- Romantic dinner and "Homeland"?
- Sex on the couch.

00:09.788 --> 00:10.847
Or your thing.

00:10.882 --> 00:12.813
- Actually, "Homeland" sounds great.
- Or your thing.

00:12.848 --> 00:14.420
Hey, Nick, um...

00:14.455 --> 00:16.621
Last night when Ferguson
and I were in the shower,

00:16.656 --> 00:18.057
I had an epiphany.

00:18.092 --> 00:19.504
It's time to get back in the game.

00:19.539 --> 00:21.022
You know, meet some women.

00:21.057 --> 00:22.361
Human women.

00:22.396 --> 00:24.019
Human? Is there any other kind?

00:24.054 --> 00:26.066
Anyway, I was wondering if
you'd watch Ferguson tonight

00:26.101 --> 00:27.893
while I go out for some drinks
with some work buddies.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.260
Just for a little while.
You just gotta give him a pill at 6:00.

00:30.295 --> 00:31.842
- We're having date night tonight.
- Jess...

00:31.877 --> 00:36.435
Winston wants to go out
to meet human women.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.100
- Without the cat.
- Oh, yep, yep.

00:39.135 --> 00:42.101
Yep, yep.
Nick will watch the cat.

00:42.136 --> 00:44.645
Question... Are those
mouth pills or butt pills?

00:44.680 --> 00:47.738
Just one pill.
Just one butt pill.

00:47.772 --> 00:49.178
- Here you are.
- I'm not touching that thing.

00:49.212 --> 00:51.022
No? Okay.

00:51.056 --> 00:53.103
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. You got it.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.812
Hey, guys.
Just hanging at home tonight?

00:54.846 --> 00:56.097
No, actually,
we have a date tonight.

00:56.132 --> 00:57.910
'Cause I just made some cobbler.

00:57.944 --> 00:59.287
Some peach cobbler

00:59.322 --> 01:00.722
and slow-churned
vanilla bean ice cream,

01:00.756 --> 01:03.093
and Coach is asking Cece
out on a date tonight, and...

01:03.128 --> 01:04.828
Does anybody want a bite
of this, 'cause it's...?

01:04.864 --> 01:07.438
Ho! Ho!

01:07.473 --> 01:09.843
It's fresh out of the oven.

01:09.877 --> 01:11.685
It's piping hot!

01:11.720 --> 01:13.563
Ha! Ha!

01:14.098 --> 01:15.677
? Who's that girl? ?

01:15.711 --> 01:18.570
? Who's that girl? ?
? It's Jess ?

01:22.496 --> 01:24.666
Well, I hope Coach
at least ran this by you first.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.736
Coach came over,
he followed the bro code.

01:26.770 --> 01:28.538
Actually went really well.

01:28.572 --> 01:31.274
Yeah. Just the man I wanted to see.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.644
- You found me.
- Yeah, I did.

01:32.678 --> 01:34.150
I got a question for you, playa.

01:34.184 --> 01:35.154
Drop the bomb, man!

01:36.192 --> 01:37.763
Can I ask Cece out on a date?

01:37.797 --> 01:40.277
Yeah! Wait, what?

01:40.311 --> 01:43.279
Wait, that's so great for Cece.
Coach is super hot.

01:44.781 --> 01:46.415
Wrong crowd.

01:46.449 --> 01:47.784
I see that now.

01:47.818 --> 01:50.251
Be that as it may,
you blew it with Cece,

01:50.286 --> 01:51.397
so you have to be fine with this.

01:51.431 --> 01:52.935
- I am.
- You are?

01:52.969 --> 01:54.842
- I promise I am.
- You are?

01:54.877 --> 01:56.686
- 100% fine.
- You're fine?

01:56.720 --> 01:58.690
- Yeah, I'm absolutely fine.
- Really?

01:58.724 --> 02:00.894
It's good for Cece, it's good for Coach,
it's good for America.

02:00.929 --> 02:03.365
Who knows? We might even get another
Tiger Woods out of this situation.

02:03.399 --> 02:04.934
Wouldn't that be nice?

02:04.968 --> 02:06.438
I'm probably getting
ahead of myself.

02:06.472 --> 02:08.241
Who knows if Cece
will even say yes?

02:08.275 --> 02:09.442
She said yes!

02:09.476 --> 02:11.912
We're going to the Staples Center
to watch a game tonight.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.053
Are you still...
Are you cool with this?

02:16.088 --> 02:17.759
Hmm?

02:17.793 --> 02:19.733
I mean, 'cause all you have
to do is say the word, man,

02:19.767 --> 02:20.737
and I'll back off, for real.

02:20.771 --> 02:22.443
N... No, man.

02:22.478 --> 02:24.779
Come on. Date that thing.

02:24.814 --> 02:27.418
- Yeah! And then date it again.
- All right.

02:27.453 --> 02:30.058
- It's not gonna date itself.
- Yeah, date it all night long.

02:30.092 --> 02:31.094
I'm kind of nervous!

02:32.235 --> 02:33.704
Yeah, I'm nervous.

02:33.739 --> 02:35.775
Yeah, I'm really nervous.
Um...

02:35.810 --> 02:37.577
I mean, she's beautiful
and she's super cool.

02:37.612 --> 02:39.381
And it's just, like...
Like, you don't even know.

02:39.415 --> 02:41.753
- I 100% know.
- Yes, you kno... You know.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.591
She stopped the wedding because
of me, so I'm just saying.

02:43.626 --> 02:45.598
And then I ruined it
'cause I had my own thing.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.870
Malia broke up with me and that kind
of, like, threw my head for a loop,

02:47.904 --> 02:49.539
so I'm super vulnerable right now.

02:49.573 --> 02:51.809
It's like... I don't know.
Think I'm feeling kind of insecure.

02:51.843 --> 02:53.546
Come on. You're Coach.

02:53.581 --> 02:55.149
- You're the Coach.
- Yeah.

02:55.184 --> 02:58.594
You're the prize.
Remember, you're the prize.

02:58.628 --> 03:00.031
You're the prize.

03:00.065 --> 03:01.299
I'm Coach!

03:01.333 --> 03:03.301
Yeah, you're Coach.

03:03.335 --> 03:05.170
- She doesn't stand a chance!
- Oh, yeah, well...

03:05.204 --> 03:06.540
She's gonna get it good!

03:06.574 --> 03:08.076
Yeah! Or you could take it slow!

03:08.110 --> 03:10.350
- Nah, I'm gunning it!
- Oh, oh! Y-you're gonna gun it.

03:10.385 --> 03:11.687
- I am gunning it. Yes.
- You're gonna gun it for real?

03:11.721 --> 03:13.756
That first-class ass
is sitting in coach tonight.

03:13.791 --> 03:16.659
And best believe,
my seat will be in an upright

03:16.694 --> 03:18.363
and locked position.

03:18.397 --> 03:20.400
Thanks, Schmidt.

03:23.073 --> 03:24.744
Oh... boy.

03:24.778 --> 03:26.080
He's gonna gun it.

03:26.115 --> 03:30.555
I don't know if you heard that,
but he said he's going to gun it.

03:33.027 --> 03:35.564
- He's really not fine.
- When he says,

03:35.598 --> 03:38.534
"I'm fine,"
he's about to get un-fine.

03:38.569 --> 03:40.237
Aw, Schmidters.

03:40.272 --> 03:42.741
There's gonna be other open mics.

03:42.775 --> 03:44.810
With sturdier stools.

03:44.844 --> 03:46.346
I'm fine.

03:46.380 --> 03:47.815
I know you're fine.

03:47.849 --> 03:50.253
Then they'll see your rap skills.
Then...

03:50.288 --> 03:53.093
Hey. Stop!
You just said you were fine!

03:53.127 --> 03:54.631
You just said you were fine!

03:54.666 --> 03:56.034
Let me die!

03:56.069 --> 03:57.836
I know Schmidt.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.339
He's gonna try and stop
that date from happening.

04:00.373 --> 04:03.109
- Okay.
- So the strategy is containment.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.110
- Okay.
- We got to lock him up.

04:04.145 --> 04:05.614
Distract him like a baby.

04:05.648 --> 04:07.985
If he gets out of line,
we got to get physical.

04:08.020 --> 04:09.423
We're gonna get physical
with a baby?

04:09.457 --> 04:11.193
Please don't question me.
I'm a pro.

04:11.227 --> 04:13.032
Or we could help him move on.

04:13.066 --> 04:15.040
Take him out, get him drunk,
maybe meet someone new?

04:15.069 --> 04:16.702
No. We just got to keep him
in a safe place.

04:16.737 --> 04:19.553
- I wish I had that dog cage.
- What?

04:19.589 --> 04:22.214
When you see a dog cage
for sale, you buy it.

04:22.248 --> 04:24.453
Hey, Jess, about tonight,
I'm so sorry.

04:24.487 --> 04:26.121
We'll have date night
when we're marrie...

04:26.156 --> 04:28.988
- Da, burp a durp a durp.
- What did you just...

04:29.022 --> 04:30.788
Merry. When we're
very Merry Christmas.

04:30.822 --> 04:32.591
All right, moving on.

04:33.528 --> 04:35.765
Hey, uh...

04:35.799 --> 04:37.870
I'm having second thoughts
about Coach and Cece.

04:37.904 --> 04:39.470
Maybe I should stop their date.

04:39.504 --> 04:40.737
Smarten up!

04:40.771 --> 04:43.070
Thank you. Um...

04:43.105 --> 04:46.074
Did you get a chance to get
that, uh... the dog cage?

04:46.108 --> 04:48.480
- No. I feel bad.
- You didn't?

04:48.514 --> 04:50.450
- That was the solution.
- I know it was.

04:50.485 --> 04:52.985
Yeah, Jess, so I j... I just...
I just buzzed him up.

04:53.019 --> 04:55.685
I... He asked me out on a date,
and I said yes.

04:55.719 --> 04:57.253
We're both going through
a breakup right now,

04:57.287 --> 04:59.257
- which is good, right?
- Totally.

04:59.292 --> 05:01.228
Gun it. Gun it!

05:01.262 --> 05:03.900
- He's here.
- Don't go past second base.

05:03.934 --> 05:05.200
Okay. Bye.

05:06.937 --> 05:09.006
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.043
Wow. Uh, y-you look...
amazing.

05:12.077 --> 05:13.311
Aw.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.714
You look...

05:15.749 --> 05:17.216
this.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.886
I give you this 'cause you look...

05:19.920 --> 05:23.024
...this, this and this.

05:23.058 --> 05:26.331
- I'll give you all these. No.
- Thank...

05:26.365 --> 05:28.134
I'm really excited about the game.

05:28.169 --> 05:29.204
Yeah!

05:29.238 --> 05:31.241
Yeah. Yeah.

05:31.275 --> 05:33.377
- I'm gonna go get my purse.
- Okay, cool.

05:33.411 --> 05:35.078
What is wrong with you?

05:35.113 --> 05:36.746
You're the prize!
You're the prize!

05:36.781 --> 05:38.381
Get it together.

05:39.917 --> 05:42.221
- Hey. What's up, man?
- Hey.

05:44.259 --> 05:47.328
That's what's up, that's
what's up, that's what's up.

05:48.531 --> 05:50.132
Really appreciate this, guys.

05:53.203 --> 05:55.338
- Are you guys hungry?
- Always. Yeah.

05:55.372 --> 05:57.341
Great. I'm gonna go get some
food from the Staples Center.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.610
- Hey, easy. Chill out.
- Okay. All right.

05:59.644 --> 06:01.145
You're right, you're right.
Great call.

06:01.179 --> 06:02.381
Hey, Winston.

06:02.416 --> 06:03.617
Hey. What happened to you?

06:03.651 --> 06:05.119
I thought you were supposed
to go to a party.

06:05.153 --> 06:06.556
Yeah, it's been so long

06:06.590 --> 06:08.859
that I think I forgot
how to talk to women.

06:08.893 --> 06:11.862
You ever wonder if someone
in here has killed someone?

06:13.998 --> 06:15.565
Ferguson is his name.
Yeah, he's my cat.

06:15.599 --> 06:16.933
Here's him in a cowboy hat.

06:16.968 --> 06:19.302
Good lord, darling,
how big are your feet?

06:19.337 --> 06:21.271
You know what?
It's fine.

06:21.305 --> 06:22.672
I'll be alone my whole life.

06:22.706 --> 06:25.108
You know, Hank Aaron was alone
for every home run he hit.

06:25.142 --> 06:26.409
As long as I got Ferguson.

06:26.443 --> 06:28.311
Speaking of which,
where is that cat?

06:28.345 --> 06:30.913
Ferguson!

06:30.947 --> 06:33.148
That's strange.
He usually comes when I call him.

06:34.517 --> 06:36.151
Nick, you left the window open?

06:36.186 --> 06:37.352
Oh, my God, no.

06:37.387 --> 06:38.754
- Nick!
- What?

06:38.788 --> 06:40.322
You know he always trying
to kick it with those pigeons.

06:40.356 --> 06:41.589
Nick, you let him out.

06:41.624 --> 06:43.158
I did... I didn't mean to.
I just opened the window.

06:43.192 --> 06:44.559
Man, I asked you to do one thing!

06:44.593 --> 06:46.694
- Winston, I'm really sorry.
- This is your fault, man!

06:46.728 --> 06:49.133
- I feel terrible, Winston.
- You're gonna help me find him!

06:49.167 --> 06:51.101
Winston, don't leave...
Winston...

06:51.136 --> 06:53.170
Okay, I'm coming, buddy.
Jess, I'm sorry, but you're gonna

06:53.204 --> 06:54.304
have to stay here
and keep an eye on Schmidt.

06:54.338 --> 06:55.771
No! No, no, no.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.506
You can't leave me here with him.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.611
No, she's right. You can't do that.
What if it gets rough?

07:00.646 --> 07:02.215
Nick, he is in pain.
I can feel it.

07:02.249 --> 07:03.082
- Don't you go!
- Stay!

07:03.117 --> 07:04.050
I am so scared, man!

07:04.084 --> 07:05.384
What do you want me to do, Jess?

07:05.419 --> 07:07.219
- Stay.
- Everybody settle!

07:07.254 --> 07:09.154
Look, this is my fault.
Winston, I'm coming with you.

07:09.188 --> 07:10.855
Schmidt, just get it together.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.993
Jess, I'm sorry.
Just keep him here

07:13.027 --> 07:14.964
and keep his mind off the date.
I have to go.

07:14.998 --> 07:15.931
I'm sorry.

07:15.966 --> 07:16.966
We got to go.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.734
Let's find that damn cat!

07:20.169 --> 07:22.303
What do you think Coach and Cece
are doing right now?

07:22.338 --> 07:24.105
- I don't know.
- They probably just sat down.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.293
Touching thighs for the first time.

07:26.328 --> 07:27.876
- I'm gonna go stop that date!
- No!

07:33.681 --> 07:36.617
Is that literally all you have?

07:37.722 --> 07:39.358
Oh, my God, we're screwed.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.760
- Nick!
- Nick!

07:43.467 --> 07:45.802
Uh, think.

07:45.836 --> 07:47.070
Coach gave me an out.

07:47.104 --> 07:49.005
He said, "Just say the word
and it's off."

07:49.040 --> 07:50.841
And you know what?
I'm just gonna say the word.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.042
No! No!

07:52.077 --> 07:53.210
You call, you say the word.

07:53.244 --> 07:54.711
No, Schmidt!

07:54.746 --> 07:56.279
God, you can't do that to Cece.

07:56.314 --> 07:58.448
She's just starting to move on.

07:58.482 --> 08:00.718
All we have to do
is get through the night.

08:00.752 --> 08:01.853
Just have to get your mind off her.

08:01.888 --> 08:03.856
What do you want to start with?

08:03.891 --> 08:05.450
? Play it now ?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.182
? Play it now, my baby ?

08:08.217 --> 08:10.262
? Cracklin' Rosie, get on by ?

08:10.296 --> 08:11.697
What's-what's happening?

08:15.770 --> 08:17.572
Maybe just go no shoes.
I don't know.

08:17.606 --> 08:19.775
Okay, and this one's
tenth grade, so...

08:19.810 --> 08:21.109
This one's from Evan G.

08:21.143 --> 08:23.710
Evan G. was the captain
of the water polo team.

08:23.745 --> 08:25.980
"Hey, Jess, we both like lunch."

08:26.015 --> 08:27.449
That's true.

08:27.483 --> 08:29.118
Oh, lean in... Aw, dude...

08:29.153 --> 08:32.155
? Play it now, play it now ?

08:32.190 --> 08:33.457
? My baby ?

08:33.491 --> 08:35.793
? Cracklin' Rosie, get on board ?

08:35.827 --> 08:38.009
Camryn Manheim represents
a woman who was heckled

08:38.044 --> 08:40.063
by a carnival clown,
and Dylan McDermott says...

08:40.099 --> 08:41.732
- I can't stop thinking about Cece!
- Okay!

08:41.767 --> 08:43.801
Nick said this would work.
Sit down.

08:43.836 --> 08:45.285
Stop thinking about Cece.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.072
Wow. Look at this leather.

08:48.106 --> 08:51.842
It's so smooth, brown.

08:51.876 --> 08:53.477
It's just like Cece.

08:53.511 --> 08:54.913
That's weird.

08:54.947 --> 08:57.283
You're right. I'm just gonna
lay down for a little bit.

08:57.317 --> 08:58.684
Okay.

09:00.718 --> 09:02.916
Oh, yeah, this feels good.

09:10.863 --> 09:12.330
Okay.

09:12.364 --> 09:13.829
What are you doing, Schmidt?

09:13.863 --> 09:15.798
- Nothing, just go.
- No, no, no, no.

09:15.832 --> 09:17.066
- Just go away.
- Okay...

09:17.101 --> 09:18.168
Schmidt, hey.

09:18.203 --> 09:19.804
No! We're getting you out of here,

09:19.839 --> 09:21.807
and we're gonna get you
a new woman, okay?

09:21.842 --> 09:23.476
Nick said to stay home.

09:23.510 --> 09:25.412
Well, Nick doesn't know
everything, Schmidt.

09:25.446 --> 09:26.645
And please stop this.
This is so disgusting.

09:26.679 --> 09:28.413
I can't even look at you.

09:28.447 --> 09:30.048
Come on, this is gross.
This is getting really weird.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.150
Please! Just one more kiss!

09:31.184 --> 09:33.688
No, you're kissing a sectional,
you dummy!

09:33.722 --> 09:35.125
All right.

09:35.159 --> 09:38.031
That was the right move.
You did good.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.833
- Ferguson!
- Ferguson!

09:40.868 --> 09:41.901
Ferguson!

09:41.936 --> 09:43.036
Come here, buddy!

09:43.071 --> 09:44.804
Come on, you little son of a bitch!

09:44.839 --> 09:46.305
We should do another lap
around the park.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.708
I bet those mean-ass kids
playing frisbee are gone by now.

09:48.743 --> 09:51.649
Winston...
We've looked everywhere.

09:51.683 --> 09:53.752
What are you do...?
Winston.

09:53.787 --> 09:55.788
Damn it!

09:55.823 --> 09:57.993
I should've never gone
to that party.

09:58.027 --> 09:59.562
Nah, the party was a good thing.

09:59.596 --> 10:01.498
- You should go to more parties.
- Really?

10:01.533 --> 10:03.302
I got shot down by,
I don't know,

10:03.336 --> 10:04.905
16 or so different women.

10:04.940 --> 10:06.140
And then I come home to find out

10:06.174 --> 10:09.011
that you have misplaced
my best friend.

10:09.045 --> 10:10.881
- Ferguson's your best friend now?
- Yes!

10:10.916 --> 10:11.917
Would you listen to yourself?

10:11.951 --> 10:13.019
This is pathetic.

10:13.053 --> 10:15.123
- Whoa.
- "Pathetic" is harsh.

10:15.158 --> 10:18.094
- I didn't mean...
- Friends don't call friends pathetic.

10:18.129 --> 10:19.328
Well, what do friends do

10:19.362 --> 10:21.595
when their other friend is
taking a shower with a cat?

10:23.931 --> 10:25.298
Wait, wait, wait!

10:25.333 --> 10:26.666
I just got a text.

10:26.701 --> 10:27.835
Somebody found him.

10:27.869 --> 10:29.337
- No way! Ferguson?
- Yes.

10:29.371 --> 10:31.070
Yes! Don't do that at all.

10:31.104 --> 10:32.971
If that cat's alive,
we're made up.

10:34.942 --> 10:36.878
How you liking that merch?

10:36.912 --> 10:38.916
Oh, it's...

10:38.950 --> 10:40.118
It's great, thanks.

10:40.152 --> 10:42.689
Yeah, yeah.

10:42.723 --> 10:44.857
- You want a pretzel?
- No, I'm-I'm fine, thanks.

10:44.892 --> 10:46.292
It wasn't a question.
Hey, yo, slice!

10:46.326 --> 10:50.165
Let me get about seven
of them hot things!

10:50.199 --> 10:51.468
You worried about the money?

10:51.502 --> 10:53.506
It's cool, I got it, babe.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.977
Coach had a good year today.

10:57.646 --> 10:59.346
Yeah, when I-I agreed
to go out with you,

10:59.380 --> 11:00.982
this isn't exactly what I expected.

11:01.016 --> 11:03.152
I know, I hear that a lot,
I hear that a lot.

11:05.524 --> 11:07.896
Uh-oh!

11:07.931 --> 11:09.066
Ha-ha! Look at that.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.734
Coach is blowing up.

11:10.768 --> 11:12.803
Oh.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.905
I'll just...

11:13.940 --> 11:15.107
Thanks.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.810
Damn it.

11:16.846 --> 11:19.083
I can't mingle with this trash.

11:19.117 --> 11:20.385
I've been to the mountaintop.

11:20.420 --> 11:21.922
Okay, look. Look at me.

11:21.956 --> 11:24.024
You are moving on.
Now, where's the old Schmidt?

11:24.058 --> 11:27.159
When I moved into the loft,
you used to pull so many ladies.

11:27.193 --> 11:28.661
You were legendary.

11:28.695 --> 11:32.136
That year, uh, Hurricane Schmidt
did-did demolish

11:32.170 --> 11:33.940
- a number of beach communities.
- Right.

11:33.974 --> 11:36.308
All right, we're gonna go talk
to this girl over here.

11:36.343 --> 11:37.910
She's on a flip phone, Jess.

11:37.945 --> 11:40.948
I mean, she's either poor
or a time traveler.

11:40.983 --> 11:42.351
Hi! This is my friend Schmidt.

11:42.385 --> 11:44.756
And he's sweet and he's smart.

11:44.790 --> 11:46.793
And he has a job that I
don't really understand,

11:46.827 --> 11:47.993
but seems to pay him well.

11:48.028 --> 11:49.427
- Schmidt, sit down.
- Okay.

11:49.462 --> 11:52.162
I'm gonna
give you two a moment.

11:54.764 --> 11:57.068
Look, you're a beautiful woman.

11:57.103 --> 11:59.640
In another life, we certainly
would've been lovers, but...

11:59.674 --> 12:03.309
my soul mate is at a Sparks game
right now with another man.

12:03.344 --> 12:04.474
I need to go get her.

12:04.509 --> 12:06.375
- Oh, you poor thing...
- Please don't interrupt me.

12:06.409 --> 12:09.680
Now, do you see that
bug-eyed woman over there?

12:11.386 --> 12:13.819
I need to ditch her so that I can go
fulfill my destiny.

12:13.853 --> 12:15.152
Now, tell me when
she looks away.

12:15.186 --> 12:16.885
Not now.

12:16.919 --> 12:19.152
Not now. Wait.

12:19.187 --> 12:20.020
Now.

12:21.925 --> 12:24.897
What might've been.

12:26.635 --> 12:29.133
Hey, Schmidt! No!

12:30.467 --> 12:33.834
What do you think he's gonna
look like when we get him back?

12:33.868 --> 12:36.870
Found him under the steps
eating a dead raccoon's eyeball.

12:38.106 --> 12:40.174
Your cat's a psycho.

12:40.208 --> 12:42.711
Oh, did my baby have
a tasty treat?

12:42.745 --> 12:45.484
Ferguson, I missed you
so much, little buddy.

12:45.519 --> 12:46.954
They're very connected,
those two.

12:46.989 --> 12:48.756
I can relate.
Got a beast of my own.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.123
Hodgkiss, wake up.

12:51.759 --> 12:54.161
- We got company.
- Aw.

12:54.195 --> 12:56.628
- Is that a squirrel?
- Squirrel? It's a hamster.

12:56.663 --> 12:58.165
Nick, you know
what a squirrel looks like.

12:58.199 --> 12:59.534
Okay, you've been outside, man.

12:59.568 --> 13:01.468
Trying to just figure out
the smell, I guess.

13:01.503 --> 13:03.737
This guy's the best.
I'd rather stay home

13:03.772 --> 13:05.841
and watch Grey's with him
than go out to some bar,

13:05.875 --> 13:08.678
try to impress some douche bag
dressed like a lumberjack.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.816
I am done chasing men.

13:10.851 --> 13:11.883
I hear that.

13:11.918 --> 13:14.051
I am so done chasing women.

13:15.219 --> 13:16.787
That's too bad.

13:22.262 --> 13:23.596
Yeah, it's too bad.

13:23.630 --> 13:26.033
You guys hungry?

13:26.067 --> 13:28.402
- Oh, no, but thank you very much...
- I could eat.

13:28.436 --> 13:30.005
Winston, do you like bologna?

13:30.039 --> 13:32.210
It's the kind you have
to peel the wrapper off

13:32.245 --> 13:33.611
just to get to the meat.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.080
And do you have pudding in a cup?

13:37.115 --> 13:38.215
I never have pudding in a cup.

13:38.249 --> 13:40.185
No.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.920
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing that she doesn't?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.422
That's a good thing.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.024
You know, I don't know
what's going on here.

13:47.058 --> 13:48.524
Find Staples Center!

13:48.558 --> 13:49.889
<i>Finding Starples Medical Supply.</i>

13:49.924 --> 13:51.725
No, you dumb pocket robot!

13:51.759 --> 13:53.028
<i>Dan plummer rubber stumpers.</i>

13:53.062 --> 13:54.631
Aah! Now you're
just making up words!

13:54.665 --> 13:55.700
That's not even a place!

13:55.734 --> 13:56.969
Damn you!

13:57.004 --> 13:58.038
<i>Maiden worcestershire sauce.</i>

13:58.072 --> 14:00.174
Huh. Chocolate.

14:00.209 --> 14:01.977
Hi, there.

14:02.011 --> 14:04.980
I'm ruining a date, and I don't
want to show up empty-handed.

14:05.014 --> 14:08.282
I will take three of the,
ooh, the dulce de leches.

14:08.317 --> 14:09.383
Um...

14:10.653 --> 14:12.188
How about some caramels?

14:12.223 --> 14:14.961
Do you have anything that says
"I'm sorry for cheating on you.

14:14.995 --> 14:16.631
Please don't sleep with my friend"?

14:18.169 --> 14:19.602
Of course you don't.
Wonderful.

14:19.637 --> 14:21.271
Ooh, look at that... Samples.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.979
Wha...? Who are you
texting right now?

14:27.013 --> 14:28.915
Uh, wh-what are you talking about?

14:28.949 --> 14:30.517
I'm not texting.
I was just, uh...

14:30.551 --> 14:31.717
You're texting right now.

14:31.751 --> 14:33.117
Nah, I'm just, uh...

14:33.151 --> 14:34.719
Okay, you know what?
Whoever you are texting,

14:34.753 --> 14:35.887
if you want to be with them,

14:35.921 --> 14:37.389
you should just go off
and be with them.

14:37.423 --> 14:39.825
You're so jealous.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.997
Okay, yeah, you know what...
That's it!

14:42.032 --> 14:43.999
That is the last straw!

14:44.033 --> 14:46.368
I'm out of here.

14:57.817 --> 15:00.085
So, Bertie, have you always
been a bus driver?

15:00.119 --> 15:01.520
I used to manage a shoe store.

15:01.554 --> 15:02.988
Then I, uh, quit,

15:03.022 --> 15:04.657
had a few dark years.

15:04.692 --> 15:07.363
- Sold christian t-shirts for a while.
- Okay.

15:07.398 --> 15:09.865
Got my tubes tied.
Not cheap.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.132
- This is a real honest conversation.
- Shut up, Nick.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.734
Pulled myself out of that
personal hell, and... voilà.

15:15.768 --> 15:17.201
- Wow.
- You know,

15:17.235 --> 15:18.668
I like driving bus.

15:18.703 --> 15:20.740
Get to put whatever I want
on the dash.

15:20.775 --> 15:23.480
Keeps the darkness away.
You know?

15:23.514 --> 15:25.015
I also, uh...

15:25.049 --> 15:26.884
I paint.

15:26.918 --> 15:29.020
You paint?

15:32.394 --> 15:33.830
It's a boat.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.534
Oh, I can see it's a boat.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.169
All right, well, uh...

15:39.203 --> 15:40.671
I better take my stomach medicine.

15:40.705 --> 15:43.376
I got to get up at 3:30.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.045
- Is that A.M.?
- I drive a bus.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.750
Will you eat
your damn sandwich, Nick.

15:47.784 --> 15:49.483
I don't like it.

15:49.517 --> 15:51.482
What about you, Winston?
Do you like it?

15:51.517 --> 15:53.252
I'm not gonna lie to you, Bertie.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.188
Sometimes it was
a little hard to chew.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.260
Well... You can suck on it
to make it soft.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.428
Wow. Is something happening
between you two?

16:06.462 --> 16:09.833
- Dude, she is so real.
- Okay, good.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.536
Would you do me a favor?
Now, you owe me.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.772
Winston, I would love to.
Anything.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.674
I mean it. Anything.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.042
- Okay.
- I owe you.

16:17.076 --> 16:18.877
I need you...

16:20.245 --> 16:21.912
...to take Ferguson home
tonight for me

16:21.946 --> 16:25.053
while I just stay here and,
you know, see where this goes.

16:25.087 --> 16:27.255
Yes. This is a big moment.

16:27.289 --> 16:28.856
- Yeah.
- I'm proud of you.

16:28.891 --> 16:31.895
Listen, Ferguson,
I'm about to do what adults do.

16:31.929 --> 16:33.130
- Hey, wish me luck.
- I think that's enough.

16:33.165 --> 16:35.368
- Wish me luck.
- Oh, this is a fat cat.

16:35.402 --> 16:36.770
It's a tough decision.
Do I...? I'll just leave...

16:36.805 --> 16:38.140
- Stay here, stay here.
- Okay. Yeah!

16:38.175 --> 16:40.907
Cece, wait! Please wait!

16:40.942 --> 16:42.475
I was texting my mom!

16:42.509 --> 16:44.242
- Dork.
- Shut up!

16:46.244 --> 16:48.114
Oh, come on!

16:48.149 --> 16:50.819
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

16:50.853 --> 16:53.154
No. I-I promise...
I... My mom...

16:53.188 --> 16:57.458
She was texting me because
I was super nervous about this date.

16:57.492 --> 16:59.495
- Your mom?
- Look.

16:59.530 --> 17:00.999
"Go get 'em, BooBoo"?

17:01.034 --> 17:03.402
That's me. I'm BooBoo.

17:03.436 --> 17:05.470
Why do you need
inspirational quotes

17:05.505 --> 17:07.672
from your mom
just to talk to me?

17:07.707 --> 17:09.674
I'm sorry. I...

17:09.708 --> 17:12.112
I'm just... I'm coming
out of this relationship,

17:12.146 --> 17:15.377
and, like... I just...

17:15.413 --> 17:16.851
I don't know.
I feel I don't know how to...

17:16.886 --> 17:19.621
I don't know
how to do this anymore.

17:19.655 --> 17:22.093
I know how you feel.

17:22.127 --> 17:23.796
You do?

17:23.830 --> 17:25.999
Yeah.

17:26.032 --> 17:28.433
Wow. Uh...

17:28.468 --> 17:32.037
I just want to put on some Drake
and get up on you, girl.

17:32.072 --> 17:33.306
You see, you're doing it again.

17:33.341 --> 17:34.976
Damn it! I know.

17:35.011 --> 17:36.345
Sorry.

17:36.380 --> 17:38.112
Hey! Schmidt!

17:38.146 --> 17:39.781
Schmidt, what are you doing?!

17:39.815 --> 17:41.783
Why do you have
all that chocolate?

17:41.818 --> 17:43.219
I'm going to go win her back!

17:43.253 --> 17:45.188
Do you know where
I can get a pretty candle?!

17:45.222 --> 17:47.159
No. Come on, Schmidt,
get in the car.

17:49.664 --> 17:51.563
Get in the car.

17:51.598 --> 17:52.930
I love her, Jess.

17:54.231 --> 17:56.498
I have to tell her.

17:56.532 --> 17:57.900
Well, you can't.

17:57.934 --> 17:59.803
You have to let her go.

17:59.837 --> 18:01.174
I know.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.343
Look, you're right. I know.

18:03.377 --> 18:05.713
Okay, good.
Come on, get back in the car.

18:05.747 --> 18:07.082
I also know
that in about 30 seconds,

18:07.116 --> 18:08.517
I'm gonna run away
from you again,

18:08.551 --> 18:09.986
and this time, I will lose you.

18:10.020 --> 18:12.522
I'll go down alleys,
I'll cut across parks.

18:12.557 --> 18:15.557
I will live in the shadows,
just slithering, lurking,

18:15.591 --> 18:17.092
trolling the darkness.

18:19.397 --> 18:21.599
Jess, there's only one way
for you to stop me.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.168
Well, I'll do it, whatever it is.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.103
Hit me with your car.

18:25.137 --> 18:28.234
What?! No! No!

18:28.269 --> 18:29.937
It's the only way
for you to stop me!

18:29.971 --> 18:31.539
No! That's crazy, Schmidt!

18:31.573 --> 18:34.109
Come on, Jess. Now, do it!
I deserve it.

18:34.144 --> 18:36.746
I cheated on your best friend,
I tried to break up you and Nick.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.846
- Hit the gas.
- No! No!

18:38.879 --> 18:41.345
Jess, you do this,
or I'm gonna run.

18:41.380 --> 18:43.916
- I don't want to!
- I'm gonna give you to the count of three.

18:43.951 --> 18:47.055
- No, I don't want to! Schmidt!
- Three. Two. Do it for Cece.

18:48.927 --> 18:52.093
Oh, my God!

18:52.127 --> 18:55.063
What the hell was that?!

18:55.097 --> 18:56.967
You told me to hit you
with the car!

18:57.002 --> 18:59.973
- You friggin' hit me with your vehicle!
- You asked me to.

19:00.007 --> 19:02.974
- I didn't think you were gonna do it.
- I barely tapped you.

19:03.008 --> 19:04.709
This is my favorite utility khaki!

19:04.743 --> 19:06.476
Well, then don't tell me
to hit you with my car

19:06.511 --> 19:08.211
if you don't want me
to hit you with my car!

19:08.246 --> 19:09.479
- You're out of control!
- What?

19:09.513 --> 19:11.481
Ma'am, please pull over.

19:11.515 --> 19:13.950
Jess!

19:13.984 --> 19:17.186
Oh, my God! Schmidt!

19:17.221 --> 19:18.588
Son of a bitch!

19:20.302 --> 19:22.867
- I know how this looks.
- Like you hit a man with your car?

19:22.902 --> 19:24.367
Twice.

19:24.401 --> 19:26.003
I only meant to hit you once.

19:26.037 --> 19:28.840
- Well, you hit me twice.
- Also, he asked me to hit him.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.777
I'm in a really weird place.

19:30.811 --> 19:33.680
- I just need to write a report.
- She's not a criminal. She...

19:33.714 --> 19:35.146
She was being a friend.

19:35.180 --> 19:37.880
I hit him
because I care about him.

19:39.484 --> 19:41.687
You guys are
into some weird stuff.

19:47.622 --> 19:50.522
Well, congratulations.

19:50.556 --> 19:52.860
You made it.

19:54.431 --> 19:55.765
I did, didn't I?

19:55.799 --> 19:57.600
Yeah.

19:57.634 --> 19:59.766
And, hey, you know, don't worry
about the hospital bill.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.500
I'll pay it.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.938
Wait a minute. Did you think
that I was gonna pay...?

20:03.972 --> 20:05.375
Well, you hit me with your car,
and I thought...

20:05.409 --> 20:10.648
You told me
to hit you with the car.

20:16.288 --> 20:18.691
Schmidt, don't pretend you're fine.

20:18.725 --> 20:20.294
I know you're not.

20:20.329 --> 20:23.964
I'm not fine.

20:23.998 --> 20:26.698
But I will be.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.534
Uh...

20:28.569 --> 20:30.237
Let's just wait it out.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.007
Okay.

20:35.677 --> 20:37.544
God, it's been a half an hour.

20:37.578 --> 20:39.779
Come up for air, you weirdoes.

20:39.813 --> 20:41.614
Mm, mm, mm.

20:41.648 --> 20:43.984
I'm getting kind of revved up.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.488
Nick has some work to do.

20:45.523 --> 20:46.925
Oh, God.

20:46.959 --> 20:48.793
Give me a chocolate.

20:53.195 --> 20:55.629
Mm.

20:58.503 --> 21:00.406
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

21:01.876 --> 21:03.440
Can I get some of that?

21:16.558 --> 21:18.359
Mm-hmm.

21:18.393 --> 21:20.428
You spending the night,
or what?

21:20.463 --> 21:22.265
Oh, hell, yeah.
