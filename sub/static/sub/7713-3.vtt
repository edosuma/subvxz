(WATCH ALARM BEEPS)

00:06.298 --> 00:07.674
Hey, Michael?
Yeah?

00:07.758 --> 00:09.384
Contractions are coming
every 1 0 minutes.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.386
Okay, just remember
to keep breathing.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.180
My cervix is ripening.
Okay, good.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.016
Jan is about to have a baby
with a sperm donor,

00:17.101 --> 00:21.688
and Michael is preparing
for the birth of
a watermelon with Dwight.

00:21.772 --> 00:25.316
Now this baby
will be related
to Michael through. . .

00:27.277 --> 00:28.403
Delusion.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.821
Michael !
Yeah?

Okay. Okay.

(GROANlNG LOUDLY)
What do you do?
What do you do?

00:34.284 --> 00:36.202
l get a call from Jan,
and l meet her
at the hospital.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.079
Right. Highways
or surface roads?

00:38.163 --> 00:39.539
l take Quincy Ave to Gibson.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.040
No. Gibson is covered
in potholes.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.208
Your car breaks down.
Adapt.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.876
l checked the route.
There are no potholes.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.837
lt's about adapting
to the circumstances.

00:45.921 --> 00:48.131
Andy, would you like
to have my baby?
Yes! Yeah.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.424
(SCREAMS lN PROTEST)
No. Okay, no.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.677

Babies are one
of my many areas

01:02.229 --> 01:04.397
Growing up, l performed
my own circumcision.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.648
Just keep pushing.
Hold me.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.692

Cradle my head !

l'm screaming !
All right. Dwight.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.740
Just push and breathe.
Numb me up.
l want anesthesia.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.283
(SHUSHlNG) No,
you can't have it.
lt's too late.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.659
No, l don't want natural.

No, you have to
just push it out.
Okay.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.582
Do you have the Sharpie?
Keep simulating.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.083
Do you have the Sharpie?
Yes, l do.

01:24.168 --> 01:27.920
Okay! When the baby
emerges, mark it secretly
in a kind of a mark

01:28.005 --> 01:30.548
that only you could
recognize and no baby
snatcher could ever copy.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.008
Okay. Yes.
Ready?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.927
(SCREAMlNG)
Okay. Coming !
Here we go!

01:35.012 --> 01:37.680
God. Wow,
what was on that?

01:37.765 --> 01:40.016
Butter. Newborns
are slippery.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.059
Nice touch. Good.
Let's try that again.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.774
This is going to be
the happiest day of my life.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.469
Hello, ladies.
How is my shower going?

02:17.221 --> 02:19.847
Phyllis, did you
get the live storks?
No.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.225
Damn it, Phyllis.
l'm sorry.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.896
Damn it, Phyllis,
it was hard enough
to convince Jan to come.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.775
So are we set
for refreshments?

02:30.859 --> 02:33.653
Per your instructions
we have the personalized M&M's

02:33.737 --> 02:38.032
with the baby names.
This is your boy bowl
with the name Chevy.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.158
That was me.

02:39.243 --> 02:43.204
And this is the girl bowl
with M&M's with
the name Astird.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.415
PHYLLlS: That can't be right.
Michael wrote down "Astird."

02:46.500 --> 02:50.002
She said it is the name
of a Viking princess, so. . .

02:50.087 --> 02:53.256
Astird.
l know. l know.

02:53.340 --> 02:57.093
lt is beautiful.
No, thank you.
ls this it?

02:57.177 --> 03:01.305
l mean, is this. . .
Two bowls of M&M's
and some balloons?

03:01.390 --> 03:03.724
You know what, Phyllis?
l think you need
to step it up.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.184
l think you need
to get the lead out,

03:05.269 --> 03:08.604
because if l'm not
mistaken, we gave you
your wedding shower here.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.441
We all came into this room
and gave you a golden shower.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.945
Well, you know what,
where's my
golden shower, Phyllis?

03:16.113 --> 03:20.575
lt does not matter to me
at all whether this baby
is biologically mine.

03:20.659 --> 03:26.080
l'm going to love it.
lt's like when the dog
nurses the tiger cub.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.165
Have you seen that video?

03:28.584 --> 03:34.547
lt is. . . lt's so bizarre
and unnatural,

03:35.757 --> 03:38.843
but it happens.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.471
Okay, l'm collecting
for the baby shower.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.891
But, Phyllis,
it's not his baby.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.893
l know, Kevin.
Why do we have
to pay money

03:46.977 --> 03:50.771
to get a gift for
his ex-girlfriend's
unborn sperm-bank baby?

03:50.939 --> 03:54.650
Look at it as if
you're paying for the cake,
not the baby. Sheet cake.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.820
l do enjoy being
the head of the
Party Planning Committee.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.741
l'm no longer under
Angela's heel, and her little
grape head is under mine.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.452
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?
Don't talk to them.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.245
l'm sorry.
Make the party.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.165
Don't. . . Make the party,
please, Phyllis.

04:19.301 --> 04:20.509
Pump it!

04:21.762 --> 04:22.970
PAM: (ON PHONE)
So you know Stacy, right?

04:23.055 --> 04:24.388
Right.
The one from England.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.807
There's no one
from England, Jim.
Katie studied in Ireland.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.769
This is Stacy.
The one who does
the Murakami-style collages.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.520
Right. That style.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.565
So Stacy and Eric
get to Foner's G-tech
half an hour early

04:34.691 --> 04:36.901
so they don't have
to sit on the slab.
Okay.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.153
Anyway, Foner's TA
Sarikaya comes in.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.489
Wait,
who's Sarikaya Komzin?

04:41.782 --> 04:45.701
No, Sarikaya comes in.
Don't interrupt. l have, like,
30 seconds to finish this

04:45.786 --> 04:47.453
and get to Digi Crit.
Okay. Okay.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.373
So Sarikaya says to Eric,
"No way, you can't
reserve seats."

04:50.457 --> 04:52.541
And then Stacy
gets all up in her face,

04:52.626 --> 04:54.418
and Sarikaya picks up
Stacy's Mi-Teintes pad

04:54.503 --> 04:56.796
and throws it
at the light box.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.881
No way.
Yes!

04:59.216 --> 05:00.216
(CHUCKLES)

05:00.842 --> 05:03.552
That's hilarious.
No, it was horrible.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.389
Jim, she might
get arrested.
Who? Stacy?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.265
No, Stacy is a boy.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.686
(SIGHING) This is
so frustrating. Why can't you
just be in art class with me?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.064
Wait, l gotta go.
CIass is starting.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.733
Okay, l'll. . .
l'll talk to you later.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.114
That was a good story.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.366
Who's Sarikaya Komzin?

05:26.952 --> 05:33.374
Yo, got the "Nard"
puppy for you.
What's going on here?

05:33.792 --> 05:37.336
lt's a baby game
where you guess
whose picture is whose.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.754
(ANDY CHUCKLES)

05:38.839 --> 05:40.006
Check it out.

05:40.090 --> 05:45.344
Who would have thought
that this little baby would be
marrying that little baby?

05:45.929 --> 05:47.471
That's Phyllis.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.725
Well. . .
Yeah, it is.

05:50.809 --> 05:54.103
So l hope you two
are very happy together.
Pervert.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.605
Wait, why does that
make me a pervert? l. . .

05:56.690 --> 05:58.399
Well, it does.
That's me.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.192
(CHUCKLES) That's not you.
Yes, it is.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.570
That's mean,
come on. That's. . .

06:02.654 --> 06:03.821
(HUFFS)

06:09.578 --> 06:12.329
Ahoy, matey!
Ahoy!

06:14.583 --> 06:18.461
Ahoy. So,
how are you doing?
Good.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.716
Listen, Jan Levinson
is coming in today,

06:23.800 --> 06:28.763
and she is
in the terminal stages
of her pregnancy.

06:29.431 --> 06:33.100
A child of which
l have a vested interest.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.353
lt's all kind of weird.

06:36.438 --> 06:42.777
Anyway, she is incredibly fat
and enormous right now,

06:43.361 --> 06:46.822
extremely unattractive,
and you are,
on the other hand,

06:47.532 --> 06:50.659
one of the more
attractive people
in the office,

06:52.162 --> 06:56.123
so while she's here
l am going to be acting
kind of cold to you,

06:57.334 --> 06:59.919
and l am doing this

07:00.003 --> 07:05.633
to pay respect to her
bloated feelings.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.887
And l'm treating Ryan
the same way.
Of course. Yeah.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.268
STANLEY: I do not
like pregnant women
in my workspace.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.437
They're always complaining.

07:18.814 --> 07:23.442
l have varicose veins, too.
l have swollen ankles.
l'm constantly hungry.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.653
Do you think my nipples
don't get sore, too?

07:25.737 --> 07:28.447
Do you think l don't need
to know the fastest way
to the hospital?

07:28.532 --> 07:30.032
(DOOR OPENlNG)

07:37.082 --> 07:39.041
Jan.
JAN: Hi, Jim.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.503
What do we have here?
This is my baby.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.046
(CHUCKLES)
Really?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.508
Oh, no.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.933
Jan had the baby,
and Michael wasn't
there to mark it.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.186
So the baby
could be anybody's,
except Michael's.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.484
So this is Astird?
Astrid.

08:05.569 --> 08:06.735
Oh ! Oh.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.779
Okay.
Why didn't you call me?

08:08.864 --> 08:13.242
Well, you know,
labor just kind of
started very suddenly. . .

08:13.410 --> 08:15.619
l could have helped.
. . .and the birth instructor
thought

08:15.704 --> 08:16.996
it wasn't a good idea
for you to be there. . .

08:17.080 --> 08:18.539
You listened to that guy?
. . .so l just. . .

08:18.623 --> 08:21.917
He had no sense of humor,
and l proved him wrong
in so many ways.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.961
Michael, you don't
have any idea
what l've been through.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.839
No, l don't.
So, l just. . . l'm sorry.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.968
l thought today at the baby
shower would be a good time
for the two of you to meet.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.553
Can l hold her?

08:32.637 --> 08:34.388
Yes. Yes, you can.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.437
(EXHALES)

08:41.521 --> 08:43.647
You know,
l think just leave her
in the car seat.

08:43.732 --> 08:44.982
Just. . . Yeah.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.110
Okay. All right.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.112
(GRUNTS)

08:51.489 --> 08:52.615
Okay.

08:56.369 --> 09:01.790
l love babies.
l think they are beautiful in
all sorts of different ways.

09:02.209 --> 09:07.630
l try to pick up and hold
a baby every day, if possible,
because it nourishes me.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.258
lt feeds my soul.
Babies are drawn to me,

09:11.551 --> 09:14.803
and I think it's because
they see me as one of them.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.350
But cooler, and with my life
put together a little bit.

09:19.434 --> 09:24.063
lf a baby were president,
there would be no taxes.
There would be no war.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.609
There would be
no government,

09:31.655 --> 09:33.739
and things
could get terrible.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.157
lt actually, probably. . .

09:35.242 --> 09:38.285
lt would be a better
screenplay idea than
a serious suggestion.

09:39.329 --> 09:44.041
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my privilege and honor
to present for the first time

09:44.167 --> 09:47.336

in the office, As. . .

Hi ! Astrid, this
is everybody, look.

09:53.343 --> 09:57.388
This is your family.
You're going to know them
for the rest of your life.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.892
Well. . .
Well, he may not
be here. Say hello.

10:02.394 --> 10:06.105
Okay. Here we go. Lion King.
Michael, Michael, Michael !

10:06.189 --> 10:08.357
That's. . .
That's too high.
l'll take that.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.151
Okay! Come on.
Let's get our shower on.

10:11.236 --> 10:14.071
Conference room.
Choppity, chip, chop.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.365
Are you okay?
You seem kind of. . .

10:17.909 --> 10:19.660
l'm fine, weirdo.

10:20.704 --> 10:25.374
Such an HR weirdo.
Try not to suck all the air
out of there when you walk in.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.548
Ready to play
some games?
Let's do it!

10:32.632 --> 10:34.550
Michael, the baby's
already been born.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.051
Yeah, duh.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.638
So we had games
planned, but the baby
ruins all of them.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.891
No, the baby doesn't
ruin anything, Kevin, okay?

10:43.351 --> 10:47.563
The baby multiplies the fun.
Let's just do
what you were going to do.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.901
Okay. Who wants to guess
when the baby will be born?

10:54.195 --> 10:58.198
All right, how about
some presents? l want
to see some presents.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.701
l got this
so l can write down
for thank you notes.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.078
Thank you.
That's very sweet, thank you.
What do we got?

11:03.163 --> 11:06.415
We all chipped in
and got you this stroller.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.751
Oh !

11:09.419 --> 11:10.836
JAN: Thank you.
She already has a stroller.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.213
And this is way worse
than the stroller
she came with.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.966
She's got an Orbit.
That's a $1 ,200 stroller.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.051
(SCOFFS)

11:17.135 --> 11:18.927
$1 ,200 for a stroller?

(SPUTTERS)

11:20.680 --> 11:22.264
MlCHAEL: Okay, what else?

11:22.891 --> 11:25.934
$1 ,200 is what l spent
on my whole bomb shelter.

11:27.604 --> 11:31.523
For that kind of money,
this stroller
should be indestructible.

11:34.152 --> 11:39.573
(SlNGlNG)
Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard l try

11:39.657 --> 11:42.242
When he started
sweet-talking to me

11:42.327 --> 11:45.079
He'd come and tell me
everything is all right

11:45.163 --> 11:48.457
He'd kiss and tell me
everything is all right

11:48.541 --> 11:50.959
And can l get away
again tonight

11:51.044 --> 11:52.127
The only one...

11:52.545 --> 11:54.129
Hey, you.
JIM: (ON PHONE)
Hey, you busy?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.507
Not even. l'm doing laundry
for the first time in,
like, a month.

11:56.591 --> 11:59.134
Okay, okay. You got
to hear this. So, Jan's
shower's going on right now,

11:59.302 --> 12:01.136
(MACHlNE BEEPS)
and she's singing
Son of a Preacher Man.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.554
l can't hear anything.
There's like. . .

12:02.639 --> 12:03.764
Everyone's just
staring at her like...

12:03.848 --> 12:05.224
There's, like,
machines going.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.601
...the song is about
losing your virginity
next to a church,

12:07.685 --> 12:10.687
and guess what?
She's been singing
for the last 20 minutes.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.648
l can't hear anything.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.735
Okay, weII,
you know what,
just call me later.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.986
Okay.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.907
l'm not frustrated.
Even if l were in Scranton,

12:21.991 --> 12:23.534
Jim and l would
have days like this.

12:23.618 --> 12:28.330
We're just
a little out of sync.
You know, that's all.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.749
Oh !

12:30.834 --> 12:33.210
Great, l. . .
l washed my lipstick.

12:35.505 --> 12:40.926
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes

12:41.010 --> 12:43.887
SteaIing kisses from me
on the sly

12:43.972 --> 12:45.722
Taking time to make time

12:46.724 --> 12:48.934
Telling me
that he's all mine

12:49.394 --> 12:51.770
Learning from
each other's knowing

12:51.855 --> 12:54.857
Looking to see
how much we've grown
And the only...

12:55.358 --> 12:57.985
Don't hit the fence!
Oh, no, my child !

12:58.695 --> 13:01.238
Don't get stuck
on the barbed wire!

13:01.823 --> 13:03.031
(GRUNTlNG)

13:03.116 --> 13:05.534
Playtime is over!

13:07.537 --> 13:10.622
So, Jan,
tell my intended about
the miracle of childbirth.

13:10.707 --> 13:14.918
Well, actually l. . . l had
a tub birth, and it was
really, really quite amazing.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.545
You gave birth in a tub?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.715
Yeah, it's a really
nice transition
from womb to world.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.300
You know,
kind of like
a big womb.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.427
So you're in the tub
with everything?

13:23.595 --> 13:24.970
Yeah, the afterbirth floats.
Yeah.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.139
Must be like the tide
at Omaha Beach.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.766
No, it's actually
really hygienic, Creed.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.059
After the birth,
you get out. . .
l'm done.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.853
Me, too.
. . .and you deliver
the afterbirth.

13:32.937 --> 13:37.316
Hey, hey, no, no,
no, no, no. No. No.
This is the birth story.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.068
lt was beautiful.
lt was beautiful.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.945
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
experience,

13:42.572 --> 13:46.241
and l should have been there.
l should have been
there to witness this.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.702
l could have helped.
You're upset about this.
l know that,

13:48.786 --> 13:54.458
and l wish that l. . .
But would it help if you held
Astrid for just a little bit?

13:57.212 --> 13:59.505
Yeah.
Okay. All right.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.675
l'm just going to lie down
for a couple of minutes.
l'm exhausted.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.388
So, remind me to talk
to you about Astrid's 529.
Wake me in 20.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.107
MICHAEL: (SOFTLY)
l usually love babies,
but when I held Astrid

14:19.192 --> 14:21.401
l just felt...

14:24.447 --> 14:25.948
Shortchanged.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.742
Phyllis?

14:31.955 --> 14:34.456
Could you take. . .
(WHlSPERlNG) Sure.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.500
Just for a second.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.001
Okay.

14:40.463 --> 14:41.838
Sweetheart.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.679
Hey, guys.
What's up, Mike?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.600
l need some advice
from one baby-daddy
to another.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.562
(CHUCKLES)
You a baby-daddy?
Yeah, l a baby-daddy.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.729
(LAUGHS)

14:59.232 --> 15:01.692
When you first
became a baby-daddy,

15:01.776 --> 15:05.445
did you have
an immediate connection
with that baby?

15:05.530 --> 15:10.200
Like, the first time that
you held it, did you find
that with your baby baby?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.578
Hell, yeah.
You know why?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.497
'Cause that was my baby.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.416
l just thought
as a baby-daddy. . .

15:17.500 --> 15:20.919
You should stop
calling yourself
"baby-daddy."

15:21.004 --> 15:24.631
Why, Darryl?
Because l'm quote
"white" quote, unquote?

15:24.716 --> 15:28.802
Because you're not a daddy,
and it's not your baby.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.597
Well. . .
You feel connected
to his baby over there?

15:31.681 --> 15:34.474
lt's. . . That's different.
You feel connected to this?

15:34.601 --> 15:38.103
That's not a baby.
You want to hold me,
see how you feel?

15:38.187 --> 15:39.521
(SlGHlNG)

15:40.773 --> 15:42.232
Could l?
No.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.532
(YAWNlNG)

15:53.369 --> 15:54.536
Oh.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.706
l was just catching up
on my sleep.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.541
l can imagine.

15:59.709 --> 16:00.834
(CHUCKLES)

16:02.420 --> 16:05.547
Where's Astrid?
l think she's
on a sales call.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.509
On a what?
"Wah, more paper. Wah."

16:09.594 --> 16:11.053
(LAUGHS)

16:13.723 --> 16:16.975
No, she's just on
her coffee break.
That's funny.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.228
She's with Angela.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.485
That's good.
Now l need you to. . .

16:26.569 --> 16:28.654
l need it to look up here.
Get the baby to look. . .

16:28.738 --> 16:29.905
Okay.
. . .up here. Ready?

16:29.989 --> 16:34.368
Yeah. Look at my finger.
Look. Look.

16:34.452 --> 16:37.496
No. Come on, up here.
Look up here.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.790
Your hand's in it.
What? Sorry.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.500
What are you doing?
ANGELA: Yeah,
that was a good one.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.918
What's going on?
Excuse me.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.045
We're taking a picture.
Honey, there you are.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.090
She's nature's bounty.
You don't flash around
a newborn baby.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.758
Don't you know that?
What?

16:55.223 --> 16:58.475
Michael, l need your help.
l was just going to. . .

16:58.893 --> 17:02.771
l was going
to talk to Holly
about her hygiene.

17:03.981 --> 17:08.276
She smells like
old tomatoes and dirt.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.572
Come on.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.248
l like to call this
the bumper test.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.942
Sure you can't stay
a little longer?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.235
No, Michael,
you know what,

17:50.319 --> 17:52.404
l really have to go.
Okay.

17:52.905 --> 17:57.033
All right, everybody,
they're leaving.
Jan and Astrid are leaving.

17:57.702 --> 18:01.288
You know what,
where is the stroller
that l came in with?

18:01.497 --> 18:05.333
l took the liberty of
putting it in your trunk.
Thanks, Dwight.

18:06.836 --> 18:12.215
Okay. You know what,
there is. . . There is one more
thing that you can do for me.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.843
Okay.
Don't date Holly.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.097
That's. . . l hate her.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.059

why would you
even ask me to. . .

18:24.520 --> 18:30.484
l mean, not that it matters,
'cause l don't, but. . .
Okay. All right. Fine.

18:32.236 --> 18:36.114
Thanks for the baby shower.
lt was great. And l'll. . .
