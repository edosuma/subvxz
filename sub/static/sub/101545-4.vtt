WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.337
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.505
I am Yavalla,
Prophetess of the Blackbloods.

00:05.505 --> 00:09.301
The subjugation of the humans
at the Outpost is at an end.

00:09.301 --> 00:13.555
- ( gasping )
- This human is dead.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.391
Talon passed you
a sleeping death elixir
when she kissed you.

00:16.391 --> 00:19.645
You'll have to
just wait down here
and recover in hiding.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.313
You must go to Aegisford.
Raise an army.

00:21.313 --> 00:24.483
The way to paradise is
somewhere at the Outpost.

00:24.483 --> 00:28.487
- The kinj.
- This is what will
free us all.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.988
There it is.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.868
Don't! Let go of me!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.828
Garret Spears is still alive.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.830
- Yes.
- We must find him.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.791
Yes, High Priestess.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.796
( music playing )

00:51.843 --> 00:54.263
- So...
- Hmm?

00:54.263 --> 00:56.682
I have a feeling you like
this Blackblood girl.

00:56.682 --> 01:00.269
Wren?
What's not to like about her?

01:00.269 --> 01:03.772
She's got everything you have.
She's, um, brave and beautiful.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.274
And strong-willed,
but she's also smart.

01:05.274 --> 01:08.527
- Hey.
- Not that you're not smart.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.570
You're really smart.
You're street smart,

01:10.570 --> 01:13.115
but she's more, you know,
hmm, Janzo smart.

01:20.038 --> 01:23.041
- My queen.
- ( indistinct chatter )

01:23.041 --> 01:25.919
As you were.
No need to stand on ceremony.

01:25.919 --> 01:30.173
Please continue celebrating
your new freedom.

01:30.173 --> 01:33.385
Gods, am I glad to see you two.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.929
Janzo,
a pint of your finest ale.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.850
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Isn't life wonderful?

01:39.850 --> 01:43.145
It's definitely better,
but it's a far cry
from wonderful.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.355
Janzo, don't be so negative.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.899
- You know,
you should be proud.
- Proud of what?

01:47.899 --> 01:50.485
Well, the Priestess
says if it weren't
for the two of you,

01:50.485 --> 01:53.613
she wouldn't be able to spread
all this beautiful peace
she's been bringing our people.

01:53.613 --> 01:57.075
Gwynn, you all right?

01:57.075 --> 01:59.661
Yes. Why?

01:59.661 --> 02:02.372
It's just you don't
seem yourself.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.667
- Your Majesty, um...
- Mm?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.378
...are you sure
you haven't been drinking
something already?

02:08.378 --> 02:10.339
Maybe using some herbs?

02:10.339 --> 02:13.467
( chuckles )
No. Why?

02:13.467 --> 02:17.346
Mm, you seem a little,
um, intoxicated.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.350
I am intoxicated, Janzo.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.809
I'm intoxicated with life!

02:25.145 --> 02:29.441
Look. Look at the wonderful
friends that I have.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.611
Talon, um, could I talk to you
for a minute alone?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.030
Sure.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.414
Everything all right?

02:44.414 --> 02:47.042
I told you,
it couldn't be better.

02:47.042 --> 02:50.420
I was just thinking,
now that we're at peace,

02:50.420 --> 02:51.963
Garret could come out
of hiding.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.259
I don't think
that's a good idea.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.636
I mean,
the Blackfist still
see him as a threat.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.805
They'll want him dead.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.849
Mm. Well, then I want
to go and see him.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.435
- Where is he?
- He's safe.

03:05.435 --> 03:10.399
- Talon, do you not trust me?
- Yeah, of course.

03:14.403 --> 03:18.448
Then tell me,
where is Garret Spears?

03:18.448 --> 03:22.202
Then tell me,
where is Garret Spears?

03:22.202 --> 03:25.330
If you go to him,
you have to be careful
you're not followed.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.376
Of course. Where is he?

03:29.376 --> 03:32.546
Of course. Where is he?

03:32.546 --> 03:35.382
He's in the sewers

03:35.382 --> 03:37.676
where the Mistress used to
have her colipsum farm.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.095
You know where that is?

03:40.095 --> 03:42.973
- Yes.
- I know where that is.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.770
( theme music playing )

03:54.109 --> 03:55.694
( music playing )

03:57.654 --> 04:00.282
( indistinct chatter )

04:10.083 --> 04:12.043
So glad that you're safe.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.587
And you, too, nephew.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.921
Thank you, Auntie Gertie.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.631
Um, but I have some bad news.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.511
What is it, Munt?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.930
I'm sorry to tell you,
but your sister has passed.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.683
She died a hero in my arms,

04:26.683 --> 04:28.643
stabbed during the battle.

04:31.521 --> 04:36.109
Um, I brought you her pipe
as a keepsake.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.322
I'm sorry for your loss,
nephew.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.324
You may keep that.
I don't smoke.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.162
Tobin, you must tell me
everything that's happened
at the Outpost

04:47.162 --> 04:49.247
- since I've been here
at Aegisford.
- There's no time for that.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.166
All you need to know is
that Rosmund and the Outpost

04:51.166 --> 04:52.709
have been taken hostage
by Blackbloods.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.503
- Oh, dear.
- I've come to gather my army.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.046
Well, that's gonna be difficult.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.547
Most of your men died
or were injured

04:57.547 --> 04:58.798
fighting the Prime Order.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.717
Your army is almost
entirely depleted.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.763
- How many do we have?
- Maybe a hundred.

05:04.763 --> 05:08.183
- You were supposed
to be rebuilding.
- I tried.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.685
I recruited the few women
willing to fight.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.355
Beyond them, all that's left
is old men and children.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.357
Does that mean we can't
go back and save everyone?

05:15.357 --> 05:16.983
Oh, shut up, Munt.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.362
You know, you really sound
like your sister sometimes.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.114
Why don't you go get
something to eat, big guy?

05:23.114 --> 05:24.783
- Over there.
- Yeah.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.076
Tell them I'm with you.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.787
Yeah.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.623
I could eat.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.892
- Tobin.
- Falista.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.355
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.190
Falista heard you were home
and begged to see you.

05:57.190 --> 06:01.194
I did. I begged.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.114
And what about Lord Relman,
your husband?

06:04.114 --> 06:07.325
He died. He was an old man.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.371
So you see, she's inherited
all of Lord Relman's
wealth and lands.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.626
Ah, and now she's free
to wed again.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.837
- Indeed.
- Gertrusha, I'm betrothed.

06:18.837 --> 06:22.841
I understand you were
unsuccessful in your quest
to marry the queen.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.427
Only delayed.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.554
Well, now I'm back
in your life, Tobin.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.347
I've known you
since we were children.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.768
You'll change your mind.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.735
Remember those?

07:00.462 --> 07:03.006
- I was doing some thinking.
- Mm-hmm? About what?

07:03.006 --> 07:06.217
Well, Mother is talking
about humans and Blackbloods
living together in peace.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.470
- Mm.
- Which means that the two
species will be interacting

07:08.470 --> 07:10.221
- a lot more closely.
- Yes.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.099
So I was wondering
if there was any, you know,

07:13.099 --> 07:18.313
biological, epidemiological,
or chemical problems with that.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.148
Not sure I'm following.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.025
Well, humans and Blackbloods
have never cohabited

07:22.025 --> 07:23.943
for any amount of time,
you know, that I'm aware of.

07:23.943 --> 07:28.365
What if they have
a physiological reaction
to each other?

07:28.365 --> 07:30.617
Hm. I've been around Talon
for quite some time now.

07:30.617 --> 07:35.121
No reaction.
Besides, Blackbloods and humans
are almost identical species.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.917
- Well, our ears are different.
- Mm, and your blood, too.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.503
And obviously those
with kinjes are different,

07:41.503 --> 07:43.505
but then they're different
to everybody, aren't they?

07:43.505 --> 07:46.758
So, uh, the point is,
those are the only differences.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.969
Are they? I mean,
are our insides the same?

07:49.969 --> 07:52.180
Do we have the same organs?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.890
Mm, pretty much exactly.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.935
Same, uh, brain, heart, liver,

07:56.935 --> 07:59.354
kidney, stomach, intestine.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.565
What about
reproductive organs?
Are they the same?

08:04.818 --> 08:07.946
Yeah, um, yes, I think so.

08:10.949 --> 08:14.369
I wonder, strictly
scientifically speaking,
of course,

08:14.369 --> 08:17.747
what if, say, a male human

08:17.747 --> 08:19.374
and a female Blackblood
were to--

08:19.374 --> 08:22.961
I don't know.
I mean, I know what you mean,

08:22.961 --> 08:26.005
I just don't know the answer,
scientifically speaking.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.007
Right.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.391
I kissed Talon once.
She's a Blackblood.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.184
That's as far as it went.
There was no adverse effect.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.644
I mean, I don't really
think she was kissing me

08:39.644 --> 08:43.982
with the intent of it
going beyond that, you know?

08:43.982 --> 08:45.275
I'm going to stop talking now.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.197
You're cute
when you get nervous.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.575
Nervous? I'm not ner--
me, nervous?

08:53.575 --> 08:54.993
I'm not nervous.
Are you nervous?

08:54.993 --> 08:57.454
What's there to be
nervous about?

08:59.789 --> 09:01.875
Yeah, time for a refill.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.013
May I have a moment?

09:15.013 --> 09:15.889
Come in.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.563
- I've been thinking.
- Always dangerous.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.233
You came back to get
an army to save Rosmund,

09:27.233 --> 09:30.445
but you have no army
to speak of.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.531
And here is
the important thing,

09:33.531 --> 09:38.787
Falista has a large intact army
within range of the Outpost.

09:38.787 --> 09:42.999
- How large?
- At least 2,000 strong.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.668
I can only guess
what she wants in return
to loan me that army.

09:45.668 --> 09:50.131
Oh, you-- you can be sure
she won't loan it to you.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.008
She'll want to merge it
with yours as one.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.971
As is the norm when, um,
two nobles marry.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.061
You want me to marry Falista?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.896
You were the one
who wanted me
to marry the queen.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.481
Yes, you're right, I did.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.901
But I see no scenario in which
case that can happen now.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.863
We take the best option
before us, Tobin.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.366
This isn't just
a business arrangement
for me, Gertrusha.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.868
I love Rosmund. I won't do it.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.995
Would it be so bad?

10:20.995 --> 10:23.414
It wasn't so long ago
that Falista was
the love of your life.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.959
Falista was the love
of my childhood.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.752
Rosmund is
the love of my life.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.099
Gwynn really isn't acting
like herself.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.309
I wish you'd let me go
talk to her.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.895
She'd tell me things
she won't tell anyone else.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.691
No. The Blackfist would
kill you at first sight.

10:49.691 --> 10:53.444
Why? If things are so peaceful
up there as you say.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.656
Mm?

10:56.656 --> 11:00.326
You were executed for
killing one of their own.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.537
If you show up alive,
they'll kill you
for sure this time.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.748
Oh, let them try.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.459
Come on, Garret.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.546
Even if you could
get past the Blackfist,

11:11.546 --> 11:12.714
their Lu-Qiri would kill you.

11:12.714 --> 11:16.426
Besides,
I prefer you alive.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.469
Since when?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.056
Since I found out
how good of a kisser you are.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.605
( door opens, closes )

11:39.991 --> 11:40.867
( grunting )

11:48.750 --> 11:51.628
- What do you want?
- Yavalla would like to meet
your human friend.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.421
How does she know I'm alive?

11:53.421 --> 11:54.672
Yavalla knows all.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.466
Now come peacefully

11:56.466 --> 11:58.968
and no one will be hurt.

11:58.968 --> 12:03.139
- What does she want?
- To welcome him
into the United.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.391
Yeah, I don't know what
that means. Do you?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.353
- Nope.
- Then it's not going to happen.

12:08.353 --> 12:12.732
Our orders are to bring you
back alive or dead.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.609
Then that's really
not going to happen.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.612
Might I suggest
that you leave peacefully,

12:17.612 --> 12:20.114
so we don't
have to kill these two?

12:24.327 --> 12:25.536
Is something funny?

12:25.536 --> 12:28.247
You have bad taste in hostages.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.416
You took the only two of us
who aren't Blackfists.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.503
And why does that matter?

12:33.503 --> 12:37.423
It matters because
we don't value their lives

12:37.423 --> 12:39.092
any more than we do yours.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.345
( grunting )

13:06.953 --> 13:08.997
How did they know
I was alive?

13:17.380 --> 13:20.174
You exposed him.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.551
You used to love him.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.469
Well, hold on, Talon.
Exposed who?

13:23.469 --> 13:25.096
You sent Blackbloods
to kill Garret.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.973
What? I would never.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.225
You and Janzo
were the only ones
who knew where he was,

13:29.225 --> 13:30.852
and I know Janzo
didn't say anything.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.854
Well, neither did I.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.981
Then why were you so insistent
that I tell you where he was?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.734
Because I wanted to go
and see him.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.902
To thank him.
Maybe bring him some food.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.988
I would certainly never do
anything to hurt him.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.035
Then how did they find out
where he was?

13:49.078 --> 13:50.538
I don't know.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.749
Maybe one of the guards
overheard us.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.551
- Are you all right?
- Mm.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.303
Just a headache.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.979
( ghostly whispering )

14:19.150 --> 14:24.655
How dare you come in here
and accuse me of revealing
Garret's whereabouts?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.824
The man I have loved
all my life?

14:29.911 --> 14:34.540
How dare you
come in here and accuse me

14:34.540 --> 14:37.043
of revealing
Garret's whereabouts?

14:37.043 --> 14:40.004
The man that I have loved
all my life?

14:40.004 --> 14:42.173
- Get out.
- Get out!

14:42.173 --> 14:44.008
- What is wrong with you, Gwynn?
- Get out!

15:00.650 --> 15:03.528
( ghostly whispering )

15:45.736 --> 15:46.737
It's just me.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.699
What are you doing here?

15:49.699 --> 15:52.076
Trying to remind you
of old times.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.330
Remember when
I used to sneak in here
when we were teenagers?

15:56.330 --> 16:01.794
I had to pay a guard in gold
for his silence.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.631
So many special moments in
my life happened in this room.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.841
In our lives.

16:09.552 --> 16:13.431
You mean like
the last time you were here,

16:13.431 --> 16:16.017
when you told me
you were marrying Old Relman?

16:16.017 --> 16:19.687
I had no choice.
My father promised me
to Lord Relman.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.314
You should have disobeyed.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.775
I was only a teenager.
And a woman.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.653
I couldn't run away
and go win fortune and glory.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.656
Disobeying my father
wasn't an option for me.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.159
Your father didn't care
about your happiness.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.870
He only cared about
Relman's wealth.

16:35.870 --> 16:39.665
That may be true,
but now both men
are in their grave,

16:39.665 --> 16:41.667
and I've managed
to inherit all of it.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.671
I'm sorry, Falista.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.756
I didn't know
about your father.

16:46.756 --> 16:50.426
I hated them both.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.387
You were the only man
who ever really cared about me.

16:57.058 --> 17:00.478
- I'm sorry, Falista.
- Stop saying you're sorry.

17:00.478 --> 17:04.106
The point is all that is yours
and all that is mine
could be ours to share.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.692
I have all I need.

17:06.692 --> 17:10.363
From what I hear,
you need my army.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.625
Maybe if this were
another time and place.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.921
But I can't, Falista.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.715
I'm betrothed
to another woman.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.343
Queen Rosmund?

17:32.343 --> 17:35.972
I don't believe
you're in love with her.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.099
You just want to be king.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.518
It started out that way.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.813
But now it's real.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.401
Please.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.906
You're making
the wrong choice, Tobin.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.061
Mm.

18:28.065 --> 18:28.941
( knocking )

18:32.194 --> 18:33.779
Knock, knock.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.905
I was told
you wanted to see me.

18:36.407 --> 18:37.283
Leave us.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.164
And what may I do
for my Queen?

18:43.164 --> 18:45.541
Oh, Sammy.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.546
We're childhood friends.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.839
You saved my life in battle.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.008
There's no need
to stand on ceremony.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.260
Please, sit. Eat.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.472
Oh.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.608
You know, if I recall...

19:13.486 --> 19:17.656
...you once admitted
that you were in love with me.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.368
Yes, when we were children.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.626
As my oldest friend
in the world,

19:28.626 --> 19:30.419
I wanted to give you something.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.312
I'm so glad you could
join the United.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.649
- As am I.
- Now go.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.401
Spread my gift to others.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.836
( music playing )

20:14.588 --> 20:17.675
The craftsmanship on this box
is really, uh,

20:17.675 --> 20:19.260
quite fascinating.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.179
You have got an amazing array
of instruments down here.

20:22.179 --> 20:25.099
Thank you.
Made most of them myself.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.642
I guess you're just
very good with your hands.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.352
Hmm, I am,

20:28.352 --> 20:31.897
even if I do say so myself.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.482
You know what?
I think we should do

20:33.482 --> 20:35.985
that scientific experiment
we were talking about.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.905
Mm-hmm.
What experiment is that then?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.825
You know, the one we were
talking about earlier?

20:42.825 --> 20:46.120
About what would happen
if a human and a Blackblood

20:46.120 --> 20:49.039
- were to...
- Oh.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.917
I mean, it would be
strictly for science.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.752
Mm-hmm.
Only for science.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.921
- And it wouldn't mean
anything beyond that.
- No. No, nothing.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.591
Just furthering our combined
knowledge of the species.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.426
Exactly.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.597
- Hmm.
- Um...

21:28.537 --> 21:30.664
- ( muttering )
- This is going to be
really interesting.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.625
I love science.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.420
I understand you wish
to see me, Tobin.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.632
- Yes.
- Gertrusha, would you mind
giving us some privacy?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.717
Gertrusha's aware
of my proposal.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.303
- She may stay.
- Proposal?

21:45.638 --> 21:46.514
Yes.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.189
I need an army,

21:55.189 --> 21:57.566
and it seems like
you have one at the ready.

22:00.819 --> 22:04.532
So, I would like to propose...

22:04.532 --> 22:07.284
a payment for
the use of your army.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.665
- A payment?
- Yes.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.962
So that's what our
relationship has become,
a transaction?

22:21.590 --> 22:23.133
Tobin,
I am richer than you are.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.678
I have no interest
in your money.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.429
My only interest is in you.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.683
Even if we were both dirt poor,

22:30.683 --> 22:34.228
I would still love you.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.564
I have done since
we were little kids.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.359
I'm sorry, Falista.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.576
I'm sorry, Tobin,

22:48.576 --> 22:52.413
because the only way
you can have my army
is through marriage.

22:52.413 --> 22:55.124
But I'll only be
marrying you for your army.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.294
Not because I--

22:58.294 --> 22:59.920
not because I love you.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.172
I know.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.757
And you still want it?

23:03.757 --> 23:07.052
Time makes love grow.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.431
And you'll be with me,
not Rosmund.

23:10.431 --> 23:14.435
And I'm confident
that your old feelings for me
will return in time.

23:14.435 --> 23:18.188
I'm sorry, Falista.
I-- I just don't believe
that would ever happen.

23:20.691 --> 23:21.692
I love Rosmund.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.285
If your feelings are really
that strong for your queen

23:31.285 --> 23:33.621
and you truly wish
to save her,

23:33.621 --> 23:36.832
the only way you can do that
is to give her up.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.926
Hmm. How very ironic.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.472
What?

23:51.472 --> 23:54.683
Well, I remember when
you used that exact same bait

23:54.683 --> 23:56.685
to try and win Rosmund's hand.

23:56.685 --> 24:00.189
- It didn't work on her.
- Is it going to work on you?

24:08.280 --> 24:11.075
( music playing )

24:16.997 --> 24:19.792
( indistinct chatter )

24:26.131 --> 24:27.633
You're really
a bigwig here, eh?

24:27.633 --> 24:30.010
I'm not sure I deserve
their respect these days.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.346
Sure you do.
You're about to become king.

24:32.346 --> 24:35.099
- It's beginning to look
like that won't happen.
- Why not?

24:35.099 --> 24:37.142
Because if I don't raise an army
to go back and save Rosmund,

24:37.142 --> 24:38.727
the Blackfist
will probably kill her.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.145
But the only way I can
raise an army fast enough

24:40.145 --> 24:42.523
is if I marry Falista.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.692
Seems like neither of them
is good choices.

24:44.692 --> 24:48.404
- Tell me about it.
- So if you marry Falista,
you save the queen.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.948
That seems like
the most important thing.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.117
You're right.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.911
Rosmund's survival is more
important than my happiness.

24:55.911 --> 24:59.248
You know what, Munt?
You're more astute than most
of us give you credit for.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.753
- What does "astute" mean?
- Rosmund will hate me,

25:04.753 --> 25:06.004
but at least she'll be alive.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.300
Did I say that?

25:20.853 --> 25:23.021
Hello, Talon.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.940
What do you want?

25:24.940 --> 25:27.609
Oh, my dear,

25:27.609 --> 25:30.279
I had thought we were
long past this animus.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.159
I'm busy.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.538
Preparing to fight somebody?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.540
Better to be prepared.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.588
Talon, it's time I passed on
some wisdom to you.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.048
More lies about my father?

25:50.048 --> 25:52.885
No.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.303
Truth about everything.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.975
( ghostly whispering )

25:59.975 --> 26:02.519
What in the gods?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.104
Talon, you will love
being part of the United.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.814
- United?
- Give me your hands, please.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.524
- No.
- Talon!

26:07.524 --> 26:11.904
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.531
Your kinj doesn't do
what you said, does it?

26:14.531 --> 26:18.368
No, it does not.

26:18.368 --> 26:21.246
( ghostly whispering )

26:38.430 --> 26:39.348
( gasps )

26:41.350 --> 26:43.769
I-- I don't understand.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.230
A kinj won't work on someone
who already has one.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.203
( grunts )

27:03.121 --> 27:04.748
Shh, shh.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.384
( ghostly whispering )

27:36.613 --> 27:40.492
Is it true your kinj
does not work on Talon?

27:40.492 --> 27:42.536
Yes.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.371
What have you not
told me this before?

27:44.371 --> 27:45.914
It never came up.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.587
Why? Priestess?

27:52.921 --> 27:54.798
What does your kinj do?

27:54.798 --> 27:57.092
Must I repeat myself?

27:57.092 --> 28:00.095
It takes us to paradise.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.430
Then why haven't we gone?

28:10.898 --> 28:12.524
Zed.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.778
You were right.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.367
I have a confession.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.702
I was wrong.

28:23.702 --> 28:27.372
- About what?
- The paradise we seek,

28:27.372 --> 28:28.957
it does not lie
in another realm.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.544
It is right here
inside ourselves.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.963
- I don't understand.
- But you will.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.759
You will understand in time.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.135
Be patient.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.179
You have done your part.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.389
All you have to do now
is watch with wonder

28:44.389 --> 28:47.017
as I spread peace.

28:47.017 --> 28:51.480
You do trust me,
don't you, Zed?

28:51.480 --> 28:54.149
Implicitly, Priestess.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.215
- Janzo.
- Nothing.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.800
Wasn't doing anything
down there.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.636
- Yavalla's kinj reproduces.
- Reproduce? No.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.638
No, that weren't really--
wasn't our goal.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.641
We were just trying to,
um, experiment.

29:27.641 --> 29:28.976
What are you
talking about, Janzo?

29:30.852 --> 29:32.270
What are you
talking about, Talon?

29:32.270 --> 29:35.315
Yavalla's kinj
doesn't do what she said.

29:35.315 --> 29:38.151
Or maybe it does,
but the one thing I do know
it does is reproduce.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.404
- How do you know?
- Because I saw her kinj

29:40.404 --> 29:42.364
split into two
right before my eyes.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.449
And then she tried
to pass me one,
but my kinj blocked it.

29:45.659 --> 29:46.576
Mm.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.015
( groaning )

30:11.893 --> 30:15.689
( moaning )

30:15.689 --> 30:17.941
( panting )

30:29.036 --> 30:30.996
What do you want, human?

30:30.996 --> 30:34.875
I just-- I just want to pass
some knowledge to you.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.752
Explain yourself.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.385
( ghostly whispering )

30:47.512 --> 30:49.222
Welcome to the United.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.673
- Garret, what are you doing
out of the sewers?
- Doesn't matter.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.134
Look, I just saw Sammy
grab this Blackblood woman,

31:26.134 --> 31:28.303
and he was sweaty and pale
like he was sick.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.014
And I swear to you, Janzo,
I swear Sammy had--

31:31.014 --> 31:32.724
- A kinj.
- Two, actually.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.811
And he passed one to--
how did you know that?

31:35.811 --> 31:37.062
That means others
can spread it.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.271
I thought it
was just Yavalla.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.107
Wait, sorry,
so Yavalla's kinj

31:40.107 --> 31:42.359
doesn't open a portal
to a new place?

31:42.359 --> 31:44.152
I'm not sure what it does.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.571
The only think I am sure of
is that it spreads.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.782
Then we have to
get to Gwynn and protect her
from getting one.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.326
We might be too late.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.078
Gwynn's the one who asked me
where you were right before

31:53.078 --> 31:54.496
the Blackbloods came
to kill you.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.498
No. No, Gwynn would
never give me up.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.960
- What if she had no choice?
- What do you mean?

31:59.960 --> 32:02.045
If she's spreading
all of these kinjes,

32:02.045 --> 32:03.880
then there must be a reason.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.383
- Something for Yavalla to use.
- Like what?

32:06.383 --> 32:10.095
Like a hive.
Maybe it connects all of
the stingfly brains together.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.389
- Is that even possible?
- Oh, yes.

32:12.389 --> 32:14.141
Oh, yes, there's many
examples in nature.

32:14.141 --> 32:19.187
There's, um, there's stingflies
and-- and waju ants.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.399
It will enable Yavalla
to control anyone who has
one of her kinjes.

32:22.399 --> 32:26.611
And what does that mean?
That she can see what they see?

32:26.611 --> 32:28.363
And hear what they hear?

32:28.363 --> 32:30.991
I don't know. Maybe.

32:30.991 --> 32:35.579
Right. If that's true,
it means we cannot trust
anyone outside this room.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.999
Not until we know for sure
that they do not have one of
those things in their heads.

32:38.999 --> 32:42.043
Which means there may be
nobody we can trust but us.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.379
Well,
there is one other person.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.428
Marriage is a promise

32:51.428 --> 32:54.890
between two people
who love each other,

32:54.890 --> 32:58.018
two people who trust
each other,

32:58.018 --> 33:01.188
- and two people--
- Minister, if you could do
an abbreviated version?

33:01.188 --> 33:02.647
I have much to attend to.

33:04.858 --> 33:06.610
As you wish,
Lord Aegisford.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.699
We are gathered here today
beneath the gods

33:12.699 --> 33:18.496
to join this man
and this woman in marriage.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.707
Lady Relman,

33:20.707 --> 33:22.751
do you promise
before the gods

33:22.751 --> 33:25.879
that no action or no person,

33:25.879 --> 33:29.049
only death can end
this marriage?

33:29.049 --> 33:29.966
I do.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.346
And do you, Lord Aegisford,

33:34.346 --> 33:36.806
promise before the gods

33:36.806 --> 33:39.643
that no action or no person,

33:39.643 --> 33:42.938
only death can end
this marriage?

33:49.444 --> 33:52.113
( murmuring )

34:00.580 --> 34:01.456
I do.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.586
Then I pronounce you
husband and wife.

34:21.643 --> 34:26.064
Right. You may now have
your wedding present.

34:32.946 --> 34:36.324
Our army awaits
your orders, husband.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.118
- Now go save your queen.
- Our queen.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.577
Yes, well,

34:39.577 --> 34:42.914
go save her
and come back to me.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.125
Just remember the vow
you made before the gods

34:45.125 --> 34:46.626
and all of these witnesses.

34:49.713 --> 34:52.590
( music playing )

35:21.494 --> 35:23.580
So I'm supposed
to believe she's, what,

35:23.580 --> 35:25.582
spreading kinjes
all over the Outpost?

35:25.582 --> 35:28.084
Yes, and she lied
to all of us.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.627
Yavalla is our Priestess.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.629
She always speaks the truth.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.673
Why hasn't she opened
the portal to paradise?

35:33.673 --> 35:35.383
She told me it doesn't do that.
She said it spreads peace.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.511
- Yeah, like a disease.
- What you're saying is heresy.

35:38.511 --> 35:41.264
Yavalla's good.
The embodiment of peace.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.640
When everyone else
was falling apart,

35:42.640 --> 35:44.142
she alone kept us going
in the Plane of Ashes.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.894
Let him go, Zed.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.817
Tell me again
why we can trust him.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.612
Because he has a kinj.
She can't infect him.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.113
Yes, but obviously
she's already
indoctrinated him.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.616
- Just explain it to him, Janzo.
- Yes, please do.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.743
- Explain it to me.
- Fine.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.953
Do you even know how
stingfly hives work?

36:03.953 --> 36:06.289
What does that
have to do with Yavalla?

36:06.289 --> 36:09.084
It's like all the stingfly
brains are connected to
the queen stingfly.

36:09.084 --> 36:12.379
It's like they all think
with one big, combined brain.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.381
And?

36:14.381 --> 36:15.882
And I think Yavalla
is the queen stingfly.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.675
How would that even work?

36:17.675 --> 36:20.720
One kinj splits into two
and then is passed to someone.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.098
And then that one splits again
and so on and so on.

36:23.098 --> 36:26.142
- It's exponential.
- And what possible purpose
would that serve?

36:26.142 --> 36:27.811
That's just the question
that I asked myself,

36:27.811 --> 36:30.188
and I came to the conclusion

36:30.188 --> 36:31.648
I think Yavalla wants
to control everyone.

36:31.648 --> 36:35.193
You humans have
an amazing imagination.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.446
- I'm not human.
- And I especially don't
appreciate the disrespect

36:38.446 --> 36:41.116
towards our Priestess
from you, Talon.

36:41.116 --> 36:45.078
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have duties to attend to.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.872
You are not going anywhere.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.083
What are you doing, Garret?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.584
Garret, you're dead.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.253
Looks like you've
seen a ghost, Zed.

36:53.253 --> 36:54.879
I am. I saw him dead
with my own eyes.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.090
- His heart stopped.
- Oh, I can assure you,

36:57.090 --> 36:59.509
Garret Spears is very much
alive and well.

36:59.509 --> 37:03.596
Now, have a seat

37:03.596 --> 37:05.390
and hear us out.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.447
You wanted to see me,
Mother?

37:20.447 --> 37:22.740
Wren, my dear child,
come here.

37:25.618 --> 37:29.414
I just wanted to let you know
how very proud I am of you.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.332
You have given me
the key to paradise.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.418
Yes.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.711
Well, considering you were

37:34.711 --> 37:37.213
prepared to leave me
down there to die,

37:37.213 --> 37:39.132
I think you owe me
an apology.

37:44.721 --> 37:47.056
You're right.

37:47.056 --> 37:47.974
I do.

37:50.143 --> 37:53.938
- Come closer.
- You've never apologized
in your life.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.106
Why are you acting
so differently?

37:55.106 --> 37:56.316
I don't know what you mean.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.359
Wren, give your mother a hug.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.028
A hug?

38:00.028 --> 38:02.197
That's another thing
you never do.

38:02.197 --> 38:04.032
What does your kinj do?

38:04.032 --> 38:06.159
I told you.

38:06.159 --> 38:10.246
It unites our people
and takes us all to paradise.

38:10.246 --> 38:13.041
- Show me.
- As you wish.

38:14.751 --> 38:18.546
( ghostly whispering )

38:18.546 --> 38:21.174
What is it doing?
How did you get another one?

38:21.174 --> 38:23.343
Mother, what's it doing?

38:23.343 --> 38:25.220
I am giving you
the power, my love.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.763
What power?
I don't want it.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.765
Mother, let me go.
Let me go!

38:28.765 --> 38:30.975
- No!
- ( gasps )

38:43.154 --> 38:44.364
- Janzo!
- Wren?

38:44.364 --> 38:47.784
- Janzo.
- Wren. What's wrong?

38:47.784 --> 38:49.327
- Something's wrong.
- What?

38:49.327 --> 38:50.954
She might be trying
to pass him the kinj.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.206
- Janzo, get away from her!
- What are you doing?

38:53.206 --> 38:55.583
Talon, please,
if she already had
her mother's kinj,

38:55.583 --> 38:57.377
it would have migrated into me.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.170
- Wait, you know about that?
- Are you sure?

38:59.170 --> 39:01.798
- Please. What?
- Mother has two kinjes.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.133
Two. She tried to put
one of them in me.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.761
Wait. Yavalla?

39:08.221 --> 39:09.514
What are you doing here?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.307
Wait, wait, wait.
He works for Mother.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.142
- He might have
one of her kinjes.
- He doesn't.

39:13.142 --> 39:16.813
- How do you know that?
- Because he's immune,
just like I am.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.691
Then it's true.
Yavalla's passing kinjes
to other people.

39:19.691 --> 39:23.069
- Yes.
- So you believe her,
but you wouldn't believe us.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.612
How do you know
these kinjes are bad?

39:24.612 --> 39:27.031
I mean, maybe they only
make people happy or peaceful.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.825
She tried to
force it on me, Zed.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.827
Does that sound like
a happy or peaceful thing?

39:30.827 --> 39:33.288
Sammy did the same thing
with the Blackblood
he passed his kinj to.

39:33.288 --> 39:36.416
This can't be right.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.801
- ( horn blowing )
- Now what?

39:46.801 --> 39:48.136
An army approaches.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.646
( music playing )

39:59.856 --> 40:00.940
Yavalla:
Who is that?

40:02.775 --> 40:04.444
It's Tobin.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.447
My betrothed
has come to save me.

40:07.447 --> 40:10.742
You do not need saving.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.618
I know.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.288
Go to him.

40:15.288 --> 40:16.748
Give him the gift.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.607
Talon, where are you going?

40:45.860 --> 40:48.488
She's going to infect him
with one of those things.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.656
We need him.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.297
Rosmund, you're free.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.593
You came back.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.929
You're my hero.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.139
But, Tobin,
you can lay down your arms.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.683
Yavalla and I
are now at peace.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.268
You are?

41:19.268 --> 41:21.729
But I'm so glad
you brought your army.

41:21.729 --> 41:24.941
Soon, yours
and Yavalla's together
can retake the capital

41:24.941 --> 41:26.317
and rid this world
of The Three.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.362
And, Tobin,
we can finally be married

41:29.362 --> 41:31.280
and have everything
we ever wanted.

41:33.950 --> 41:39.414
( ghostly whispering )

41:39.414 --> 41:41.541
- Talon!
- I have to stop her.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.751
It's too late!

41:43.751 --> 41:46.629
The only thing
you'll do now is expose us.

42:01.769 --> 42:05.273
( theme music playing )
