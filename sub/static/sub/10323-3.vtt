Where's that female guard
that looks like the coach
of the Pittsburgh Steelers?

00:11.912 --> 00:14.682
She's sick today, so they said
I get to frisk all the women,

00:14.748 --> 00:18.186
'cause if someone sues,
I got the least stuff to lose.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.092

Here. Brought you some cupcakes,
some socks I made
and some magazines.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.565
Since they won't let me
bring in nudie mags,

I drew naughty parts
on all the people

tell you? You don't have to
keep bringin' me stuff.

Earl, every day I feel
more and more "terribler"
that you're in here.

you wouldn't be sittin'
in this prison right now...

your throat if they only had--

He used to work at

I hadn't seen Frank

worn out our welcome
livin' with our parents,

01:08.269 --> 01:13.073

we were homeless.

where are we going?

01:38.399 --> 01:41.169
I don't know, Randy.
We're just walking.

Maybe we should
pick up the pace,

try to get some of that
bug poison out of our lungs.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.243
Oh, I don't mind the poison.
I think I swallowed
a praying mantis the other day,

01:49.310 --> 01:52.613
and I'm pretty sure
I felt it lay some eggs.

and Randy tried to figure out
where we were gonna call home,

02:10.097 --> 02:13.201
a young woman
we hadn't yet met was dealin'
with her own problems.

02:13.267 --> 02:16.704
You see, a little while back,
Joy had had a one-night stand
with a man,

02:16.770 --> 02:20.608
and he didn't leave his number,
but he did leave her
with somethin' else.

* I've been tryin'
to make it home *

And when she started to show,

02:29.317 --> 02:31.252
her parents threw her
out of her house too.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.822

if this turns out to be

02:34.888 --> 02:36.990
* Very much longer *

Eventually, Joy found herself
at Camden's only motel.

02:53.341 --> 02:58.412
And as soon as
she smelled the room, she knew
she needed a better plan.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.415

I'm gonna have to
find you a sugar daddy.

pops in for a visit.

people in our neighborhood,
Wednesday was trash day.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.793
For me and Randy,
it was movin' day.

Keep your eye out for
a front yard with a hammock
or a pile of dry leaves.

It was right below a flyer
for a missing boa constrictor...

for a bunch of missing cats
and chickens.

It's not bad, right?

03:46.594 --> 03:49.630
You got the stove,

is the dishwasher.

about it is--

the right to use the fridge
and the sink/half bath.

back in time for the robbery,
