I thought you were asleep.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.477
Yeah, well...

12:46.560 --> 12:48.278
The early bird catches the worm.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.635

Well, that's...

12:57.560 --> 12:58.914
...strange.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.560
It's my flat. I can shit where I like.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.471
I should probably flush it.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.755
It's a bit of a stinky one.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.559
- Hmm.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.473
He shits in a bucket?

13:21.560 --> 13:25.679
Yeah, well, more to the point,
what if it isn't his shit?

13:25.760 --> 13:26.909
Whose shit was it?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.150
Right, well, he's got this door,
keeps it locked.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.719
Keep hearing all this talking through it.

13:30.800 --> 13:34.680

he keeps going on about?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.274
Ally's asked for a different model.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.920
What? Why does she want a different model?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.798
Are you questioning me?

13:46.880 --> 13:50.635
You don't get to question me, because
as far as you're concerned, I am God.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.519
And you know what happens
when you fuck with God.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.194
There is an almighty shitstorm.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.557
Now, swap with this bell-end,
if you think you can manage it.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.317
(CHUCKLES) D'you wanna know
why she wanted to swap?

14:04.400 --> 14:08.030
Because even though she's blind,
she can still see my inner beauty.

It's Curtis.

From yesterday.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.433
Why did you ask to change models?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.119
I don't have to explain myself to you.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.831
Did I do something to offend you?

14:52.720 --> 14:54.791
Look, it's obvious
you've got some kind of problem with me,

14:54.880 --> 14:56.234
so why don't you just tell me what it is?

14:56.320 --> 14:58.197
I think that people like you
and people like me

14:58.280 --> 14:59.839
should stick to our own kind.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.991

15:02.080 --> 15:04.435
That's your word.
You can call it that if you want.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.272
I call it that because that's what it is.

Lovely blind Ally wi' her shiny hair,

15:25.240 --> 15:28.756
She asked to change models
cos I'm black. She's a racist.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.877
She's blind.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.112
I think it... That cancels it out,

needed you to take a power from.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.674
(WHISPERS) How would that Work?

17:57.760 --> 18:00.400
It wouldn't. I'm retired.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.272
Retired?

18:03.360 --> 18:06.000
But you're so young and handsome.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.957
So much more to give.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.235
Are you coming on to me?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.310
No.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.032
- What's going on?
- I think he's asking me

18:18.120 --> 18:21.670
- to take someone's power.
- Asking you to take someone's power?

18:21.760 --> 18:23.751
That's hilarious.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.796
Right!

18:45.520 --> 18:47.830
keeping someone a prisoner like that,

18:47.920 --> 18:50.355
and tying 'em up
and making them shit in a bucket,

18:50.440 --> 18:52.750

Girlfriend! Girlfriend.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.075

18:59.160 --> 19:00.958
She's got a power.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.272
She can make me
into a perfect boyfriend.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.113
Whatever she said,
whatever she told me to do, I did it.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.679
I stopped drinking,

19:14.760 --> 19:16.910
I stopped...
I stopped going out with me mates.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.276
All I cared about was making her happy -

19:20.360 --> 19:22.237
endless presents

19:22.320 --> 19:25.312
and flowers and pampering.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.879
The conversations.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.110
We had to discuss everything.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.716
Me jaw physically ached
from all the talking.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.791
That and the hours of cunnilingus.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.435
I practically lived with me face
between her thighs.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.397
Some days I felt like
I didn't see the sun.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.278
Oh, man, that is just...

19:42.360 --> 19:44.636
There's no man that could live like that.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.190
A few weeks ago,
she went to Ibiza with her friends,

19:48.280 --> 19:50.590
leaving me to deep-clean the flat.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.638
With her being away,
her hold over me faded and...

19:54.840 --> 19:57.593
I realised what she was doing
and I did the only thing I could do.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.439
I tied her up and gagged her.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.517
To stop her using her power on me.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.273
Why didn't you just leave her?

20:05.360 --> 20:06.509
Because I love her!

20:06.600 --> 20:09.956
You can't just tie people up
and keep 'em prisoner.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.112
It's weird and it's just fucking creepy.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.714
I was only doing it till I found a cure.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.872
Then we could be together again.
It's gonna be like it was.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.190
You don't think she's gonna be
a tiny bit angry with you?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.509
Maybe, at first.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.194
But what was I supposed to do?
Just give up on her?

20:26.280 --> 20:28.874
It's easy to walk away, isn't it?
I won't do that.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.953
We'll get through this,
so you can fuck off judging me!

20:35.040 --> 20:38.556
You think this is easy? You think
I'd do this if I didn't love her?

20:39.800 --> 20:41.029
Come round,

20:41.120 --> 20:42.315
wipe her arse.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.038
See how much fun that is.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.157
You have no idea.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.310
So fuck yous all.

20:50.760 --> 20:51.795

20:51.880 --> 20:55.077
You should probably know
that the other me,

20:55.160 --> 20:56.878
he's gone round to your flat
and he's...

20:56.960 --> 20:59.520
well, he's breaking into the room where
you've got your girlfriend all tied up.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.877
D'you know, I thought
it was a talking dog, me. (LAUGHS)

21:44.760 --> 21:47.070
Dude, it was his girlfriend.
He's had her tied up.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.356
You've had her pooing in a bucket!

21:49.440 --> 21:50.953
Yes, and with very good reason.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.920
She has been abusing him, she's been
pussy-whipping the hell out of him, man.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.560
- What?
- Where is she?

21:59.560 --> 22:01.392
She was having trouble walking.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.552
Her legs weren't working properly.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.234
They've gone all wobbly,
you've had her tied down for so long.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.834
I rang her a taxi and, <i>er...</i>

22:11.400 --> 22:13.471
Well, she's gone, man.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.471

22:25.400 --> 22:26.629

I've lost her.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.877

22:33.960 --> 22:35.439
and now she's gone.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.637
I dunno what to do.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.676
Hmm?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.598
Oh, come on! Look on the bright side.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.435
Cos in the not-too-distant future,
I'm pretty sure

22:47.520 --> 22:51.479
I am gonna be having sex
with a beautiful blind girl.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.119
You're a friend of Curtis, right?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.191
I know him from community service.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.477
You're on community service? Seriously?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.549
Don't look like the type.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.074
What type do I look like?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.197
Like a nice, normal girl.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.032
Looks can be deceiving.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.394
I've heard that.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.994
So, er, what did you do?

23:32.080 --> 23:34.720
I sexually assaulted a hot barman.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.151
That's six quid.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.159
<i>Um...</i>

23:47.240 --> 23:48.560
That was a joke.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.240
Obviously not a very good one.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.792
I never sexually assaulted anyone.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.632
Right.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.911
(TILL RINGS)

24:12.000 --> 24:14.230
- What can I get you?
- Don't take it personally.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.799
I see all these girls coming on to him.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.473
I wasn't coming on to him.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.354
What's your point?

24:21.560 --> 24:23.119
He knocks them all back.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.719
(WHISPERS) I think he might be gay.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.555

24:41.560 --> 24:45.519
Oh! It's a tragedy
you've never seen them!

Fuck me!

I will fuck you...

24:50.440 --> 24:52.192
"All night long."

24:52.280 --> 24:53.634
All night.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.398
Have you got a condom?

24:59.480 --> 25:02.393
Of...of...of course,
of course I've got a condom!

25:02.480 --> 25:03.515
Course I have, yeah.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.319
Cos I always say, better to be safe...

38:32.600 --> 38:34.193
What would Bob Geldof do?

38:56.760 --> 38:57.989
(SHE MOANS)

39:04.880 --> 39:06.109
Take her power.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.795
- No! You stay away from her.
- Get the fuck out of my flat!

39:09.880 --> 39:10.870
Do it!

39:12.040 --> 39:12.996
SADIE: What are you doing?

39:13.080 --> 39:14.150
Fuck off!

39:14.240 --> 39:15.958
FINN: Don't touch her. Ow! Jesus!

39:16.040 --> 39:18.475
- JESS: Shut up! Do it.
- SADIE: No!

39:30.240 --> 39:31.639
So I guess I'm all done.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.116
Thanks.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.910
If you ever find yourself in Uganda,
come and say hello.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.871
<i># In the winter time</i>

39:55.960 --> 39:58.315
# <i>Keep your feet warm...</i> #

39:58.400 --> 39:59.629

39:59.720 --> 40:02.758
<i>It ...But keep your clothes on</i>

40:02.840 --> 40:05.992
# Don't forget me... #

40:06.080 --> 40:07.275
Are you OK?

40:07.360 --> 40:10.318
<i># ...Keep your memories</i>

40:10.400 --> 40:15.270
# <i>But keep your powder dry too...</i> #

40:21.280 --> 40:22.839
We were happy.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.877
It was bullshit and you know it.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.233
Just stop lying to yourselves.

40:32.280 --> 40:35.591
<i>It ...In the summer</i>

40:35.680 --> 40:39.071
<i>it By the poolside</i>

40:39.160 --> 40:45.873
<i>ll While the fireflies are all around you</i>

40:45.960 --> 40:50.750
<i>it HI miss you when Fm lonely
I'll miss...#</i>

40:50.840 --> 40:52.114
I'm sorry.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.398
You can't say we didn't try.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.714
So who gets the flat?

41:09.440 --> 41:13.115
- So where are you gonna live?
- Well, we have found a spacious,

41:13.200 --> 41:16.909
rent-free home
with a panoramic view of a lake.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.116
You mean you're moving
into the community centre.

41:19.200 --> 41:22.238
There's no flies on you, is there? Clever.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.198
We're gonna be flatmates.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.311
Hmm?Hmm?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.390
No? Come on.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.074
And you two should move in wi' us.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.549
Imagine all of us living
under same roof

41:34.640 --> 41:37.109
like one big, happy family...
like The Waltons.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.191
I see that happening, you fucking prick.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.920
Well, that's a shame, and that's why
you're never gonna be in The Waltons.

41:44.600 --> 41:47.114
I fucking love The Waltons, man.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.158
It's just, it's good, wholesome,
family entertainment.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.959
I tell you, the cunts don't make
telly like that any more.

42:08.800 --> 42:09.870
Who are you?

42:12.840 --> 42:14.160
I'm here for Weight Watchers.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.916
- Seriously?
- No.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.396
I'm Lola.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.470
Curtis.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.516
So if you're not here for Weight Watchers,
why are you here?

42:29.960 --> 42:32.076
I'm a trainee probation worker.

42:32.160 --> 42:36.154
(SCOFFS) You?
You're a trainee probation worker?

42:37.280 --> 42:39.430
Is that going to be a problem for you?

42:40.800 --> 42:41.870
I'll manage.

42:41.960 --> 42:42.950
Good.

42:44.440 --> 42:47.398
It's nice to meet you...Curtis.

42:55.520 --> 42:57.909
Oh, mate, that's excellent.
Look at fresh meat.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.116
Look at the size of them.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.316
Every woman you see,
they're just a hole

43:02.400 --> 43:04.073
into which you can potentially
insert your penis.

43:04.160 --> 43:08.518
Three! There's three bloody holes in which
I could potentially insert me penis.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.477
How do we even belong
to the same species?

43:10.560 --> 43:16.238
As one wise twat once said,
men are from Mars, and women...

43:16.320 --> 43:17.355
love a penis.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.670
It's "from Venus".

43:19.760 --> 43:20.716
Cha...!

43:22.080 --> 43:23.354
(WHISPERS) Spot the lesbian.

43:59.760 --> 44:03.879
I like watching other people work.
Now scrub the fucking wall.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.280
Is this some kind of power trip to you?

44:05.360 --> 44:07.033
You could come over later
and watch a DVD.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.952
It's cos you wanna
get in my knickers, right?

44:09.040 --> 44:10.155
I'll settle for a kiss.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.560
When was the last time you even got laid?

44:11.640 --> 44:15.110
- Fuck off.
- You act all tough and sassy.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.111
I see right through you.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.838
<i>JESS: What's happened to you?</i>

44:18.920 --> 44:20.638
<i>RUDY". There's three of me.</i>

44:20.720 --> 44:23.109
<i>There's the two you've met already
and then there's me.</i>

44:23.200 --> 44:24.554
<i>Fm a whole different person.</i>

44:24.640 --> 44:26.153
You're a fucking psychopath.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.629
We'll leave town.
We'll do whatever you want.
