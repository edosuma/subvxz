Class, I would like you

02:40.161 --> 02:43.695
retired Air Force Sergeant
Ms. Berrera.

02:43.697 --> 02:44.763
BART:
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

02:44.765 --> 02:46.331
Air Force?
Sergeant?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.633
A woman?

02:47.635 --> 02:48.934
(Spanish accent):
Good morning, crew.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.336
I am proud to be here
educating my country.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.305
(students gasping)

02:53.307 --> 02:55.274
For you, teacher.

02:57.143 --> 02:59.344
Because if there's one thing
I learned in combat,

02:59.346 --> 03:03.215
it's that the most powerful
weapon is knowledge.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.317
What's
the second most powerful weapon?

03:05.319 --> 03:08.220
Shoulder-mounted
anti-tank missile. Duh.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.356
Did you ever <i>American Sniper</i>
<i>someone?</i>

03:11.358 --> 03:15.727
Uh, that's really
not appropriate for me to say.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.729
How many hospitals
did you help build?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.965
Negative three.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.633
BART: <i>Oh, my God,</i>

03:53.200 --> 03:55.667
Oh, yeah. I thought

04:49.456 --> 04:50.455

04:50.457 --> 04:52.090

04:55.329 --> 04:57.262

04:57.264 --> 05:01.133
another case of the rich cows
stickin' it to the little guy.

05:01.135 --> 05:04.436
Okay, don't worry. We're going
to get you into a milk today.

05:04.438 --> 05:08.473
Hmm. I like it's
in a plastic bottle

05:08.475 --> 05:10.475
that'll be around for
millions of years.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.477
But is it good
for my kids?

05:12.479 --> 05:14.079
I know you have concerns.

05:14.081 --> 05:18.083
But this video will gloss over
all of your questions.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.152
It'd better.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.486
Hmm.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.323
How's that milk, Jimmy?
Boring.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.326
Now, we could engineer a new
Jimmy who is less of a brat,

05:27.328 --> 05:30.962

You said "milk."

06:03.163 --> 06:05.530
We can't, legally.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.699
I'm not the kind of guy

06:17.544 --> 06:18.910
Don't want to be late
for school.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.413
Hair combed,

Hmm, let's see.

(muttering)
Nope, today we're off.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.995
The courthouse is closed because
the judge is becoming a citizen.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.597
What gives, boy?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.399

I'm the last one

just how big

06:52.746 --> 06:55.380

06:55.382 --> 06:58.417

Bart possibly be connected

10:47.247 --> 10:49.247
And there. See how
it's done, boy?

10:49.249 --> 10:50.815
Dad, aren't you supposed

10:50.817 --> 10:52.784
to take the little plastic
thing off the blade?

10:52.786 --> 10:56.821
Really? I always
wondered about that.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.023
Hmm.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.658
(humming)

10:59.660 --> 11:03.294
(gasps)
Well, hello, Billy Zane.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.863
(purring)

11:04.865 --> 11:07.265
Sweetie, every kid
goes through this.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.834
That's why
proms are dark.

11:09.836 --> 11:14.539
Just stick some carrots in there
three times a day.

11:17.309 --> 11:21.012
So we won't see your sweet
little face for ten more years?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.714
(crying)

11:22.716 --> 11:27.118
Mom, the inside of this hoodie
is covered in tears.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.021
Let me try
some makeup.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.523
(whimpering)

11:31.525 --> 11:33.825
Cruelty-free?
Oh, yes.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.694
I'll be very gentle.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.862
Marge? Marge,
you got to see this!

11:37.864 --> 11:38.863
Oh, what is it?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.699
D'oh!

11:46.472 --> 11:48.840
I actually have two
different PTSDs.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.709
The kind we combat
veterans know.

11:50.711 --> 11:54.879
And also parent-
teacher-student dilemmas.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.715
No!

11:56.717 --> 11:58.850
(squeaking, grunts)

11:58.852 --> 12:00.552
(gasps)
Bart!

12:00.554 --> 12:02.053
Do not worry.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.789
I am certified
as a paramedic.

12:07.693 --> 12:11.496
Oh! Teacher,
could you kiss my owie?

12:11.498 --> 12:14.332
Boy, owies can only
be kissed by Willie.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.867
(panting)

12:15.869 --> 12:18.737
Where's the owie?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

12:18.739 --> 12:22.107
Whoa, Lisa,
you look great!

12:22.109 --> 12:24.175
Beautiful and mature.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.277
Like a sideline
reporter.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.079
Oh. R-Really?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.381
Didn't know you
were so cool.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.285
Well, um, uh,
well, duh.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.522
LISA:
<i>Oh, my God, I'm popular!</i>

12:37.524 --> 12:39.758
<i>Hope this doesn't go</i>
<i>to my head.</i>

12:39.760 --> 12:42.093
<i>It went right to my head! Aah!</i>

12:42.095 --> 12:44.929
So when you're done with
this page, you will learn

12:44.931 --> 12:47.899
how tectonic plates
rub against each other

12:47.901 --> 12:50.802
till something
gives deep down.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.104
(laughs)
You do not have
to tutor this boy

12:53.106 --> 12:55.540
under the new One
Child Left Behind law.

12:55.542 --> 12:59.377
But he needs help, and he's not
going to be a child much longer.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.379
He's got a mustache
coming in.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.981
Yeah, so beat it,
bald lip.

13:05.552 --> 13:10.789
Oh, my God, I just got invited
to my first third-grade party!

13:10.791 --> 13:12.557
Are the parents
gonna be home?

13:12.559 --> 13:14.559
Yes.
(scoffs)
Lame.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.594
Guys, I need to
sharpen my mustaches.

13:16.596 --> 13:17.929
Which is better--

13:17.931 --> 13:19.764
A or B?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.633
<i>A...</i> or B?

13:21.635 --> 13:23.134
A or B?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.804
<i>A...</i> or <i>B?</i>

13:25.806 --> 13:27.338
B.
A.
N.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.807
Ugh! I'm tired of my son

13:28.809 --> 13:31.342
having a mustache
like a pool boy.

13:31.344 --> 13:35.446
Hey, those pool boys pull
in some sweet jingle.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.448
Plus, they get to
work in flip-flops.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.818
Homie, it's time
we figured this out.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.953
Maybe milk will
help us think.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.588
How would milk do that?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.657
It's from cows
who are smart enough

13:45.659 --> 13:47.826
not to get turned
into hamburger.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.194
Hmm.

13:49.196 --> 13:52.964
Oh. I never looked closely
at this milk before.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.033
Is it made by a soda company?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.968
They don't just make soda,
Marge.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.837
They also make industrial foam.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.607
(belches loudly)

14:02.609 --> 14:04.042
Homer, it's the milk!

14:04.044 --> 14:05.043
Oh.
Hey.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.379
I'll call the help hotline
on the carton.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.015
(touch tones sounding)

14:11.017 --> 14:13.017
(phone ringing)

14:13.019 --> 14:15.053
Talk to me.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.654
Yes, I need a milk refund.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.023
Right. Um, address, please?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.992
Wait, wait. Hold on.

14:20.994 --> 14:27.031
742 Nevergreen...
Oh, Evergreen Terrace.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.701
Sorry. Our system's
a little slow.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.402
(indistinct chatter)

14:31.404 --> 14:34.239
(whistling)

14:34.241 --> 14:35.240
Aw!

14:35.242 --> 14:38.710
(both moaning)

14:38.712 --> 14:42.213
Ew! I mean, cool!

14:42.215 --> 14:44.482
I just turned a
big corner, Bart.

14:49.922 --> 14:52.023
(humming)

14:52.025 --> 14:53.858
(laughing):
Oh, Simpson,

14:53.860 --> 14:55.894
I called you here to gloat.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.863
(scoffs) Yeah, yeah, I know
about you and Berrera.

14:58.865 --> 15:01.099
You know about me and Carol?

15:01.101 --> 15:02.901
(gasps)
You know her name?

15:02.903 --> 15:05.036
Oh, first and middle,
and I know more.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.039
Her favorite salad bar item
is little shredded cheese.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.507
(scoffs)
Everyone likes that.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.676
Oh, I know a lot
more than that.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.444
She's never seen
an episode of <i>Friends.</i>

15:13.446 --> 15:15.079
Not even "The
One with..."?

15:15.081 --> 15:16.281
No, not one.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.283
And she has a cat
with different color eyes.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.885
His name is Bowie.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.887
No!

15:22.889 --> 15:25.356
Face it, Simpson,
you can't compete with me.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.125
I can rent a car.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.929
How can I derail
his happiness?

15:30.931 --> 15:33.898
I got a delivery
of live class pets here.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.534
Interesting. Excuse me.
I have one question.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.369
Yes.

15:38.371 --> 15:42.106
When you're in the shower,
do you shampoo your mustache?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.275
Of course.
It's a must-stache,

15:44.277 --> 15:46.477
not an
if-you-feel-like-it-stache.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.079
All right,
have a good day.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.080
Dickory doo.

15:49.082 --> 15:52.283
(both moaning)

15:52.285 --> 15:54.118
I brought you
some candy, Carol.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.287
Not from CVS,
not from Walgreens.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.956
From the airport.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.124
And I wasn't even
going anywhere.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.392
Oh!
Ah.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.795
Your candy's filled
with chupacabras.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.764
We've been pranked
or possibly punked.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.599
I know who
your prankster is.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.168
The Simpson lad.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.403
Were you watching us make out?

16:12.405 --> 16:13.972
I was watching you try.

16:16.608 --> 16:19.944
Mom, could you please,
please, <i>please</i>

16:19.946 --> 16:22.013
stay within the lip liner?

16:22.015 --> 16:24.816
A week ago, you'd never
even worn makeup.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.151
Now you're an expert
like Ace Frehley.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.020
Aah!

16:34.827 --> 16:36.995
Sherri. Terri. (laughs)

16:36.997 --> 16:40.164
I usually don't see double
until an hour into the party.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.366
(giggles)

16:41.368 --> 16:43.334
(thunder rumbling)

16:43.336 --> 16:44.969
<i>It's going to rain,</i>

16:44.971 --> 16:46.337
<i>and rain washes off makeup,</i>

16:46.339 --> 16:48.606
<i>and then they will see me</i>
<i>as I truly am--</i>

16:48.608 --> 16:50.775
<i>imperfect, blemished,</i>

16:50.777 --> 16:52.977
<i>a social mess</i>
<i>in a lampshade dress.</i>

16:52.979 --> 16:54.545
(thunderclaps)

16:54.547 --> 16:56.547
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

16:56.549 --> 16:58.182
<i>Lisa, you were never popular,</i>

16:58.184 --> 17:00.218
<i>so you're playing</i>
<i>with the house's money.</i>

17:00.220 --> 17:02.153
Attention, party!

17:02.155 --> 17:05.189
I'm not like you.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.860
What I'm saying is, I gave
my Christmas money to NPR.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.396
I have a chemistry set...
that I've used!

17:11.398 --> 17:12.997
MAN:
Is there a point to this?

17:12.999 --> 17:14.799
And beneath all this makeup,

17:14.801 --> 17:17.035
I have... problem skin.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.237
KIDS:
Ew!

17:21.874 --> 17:23.875
What are you
talking about?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.877
Your skin
is fine.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.579
Really? The bad milk wore off.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.416
So, uh, admitting
you're not cool is probably

17:31.418 --> 17:33.651
the coolest thing
you can do, right? (laughs)

17:33.653 --> 17:35.186
(kids murmuring)

17:35.188 --> 17:38.322
I will see myself out.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.258
(groans)

17:41.493 --> 17:44.028
You look
ba-lonely.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.263
I feel ba-lonely.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.832
You want to be friends?
I do.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.867
Um, how clean
is that hand?

17:49.869 --> 17:51.402
Mmm... mah!

17:51.404 --> 17:53.104
Cleaner now.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.405
Okay.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.507
A fish says, "Moo!"

17:56.509 --> 17:58.843
(quietly):
This isn't gonna
last long.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.845
I still take baths
in the sink.

18:00.847 --> 18:04.115
Okay, it's over.
Sorry, Ralph.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.951
I'll be eating crayons for one.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.054
(hissing)

18:10.056 --> 18:11.856
(explosion)

18:11.858 --> 18:13.458
Oh, the plan is perfect!

18:13.460 --> 18:15.860
I just have to get Skinner
to hold still

18:15.862 --> 18:17.862
while I slip a firecracker
in his butt.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.263
LISA:
Come on, give it up.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.866
Bart, I realized
what's been going on.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.869
We've been operating under
the influence of hormones.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.305
Hormones? Sounds far-fetched.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.873
(in deep voice):
Very far-fetched.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.275
Well, it's true, so
give Skinner a shot.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.311
Everyone deserves happiness.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.947
Even wieners.

18:39.551 --> 18:42.487
Hey, Dad, how much
does the Mustache Fairy pay?

18:42.489 --> 18:45.156
Hmm, three bucks.

18:49.161 --> 18:52.663
When you asked me to go skating,
I really thought you knew how.

18:52.665 --> 18:57.135
Uh, I thought I could learn by
watching YouTubes this morning.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.337
All right, Simpson, I'm here.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.772
Do what you do best--
your worst.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.108
Look, Seymour,
I'm not gonna do a thing.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.744
Carol, he's all yours.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.513
Wow. The first
war I've won.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.282
Uh, Carol, all that's left is
for you to meet my mother,

19:11.284 --> 19:13.351
and, uh, up
she skates now.

19:13.353 --> 19:17.788
My son, I just want to say, I
wish the four of you the best.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.490
Four of us?

19:19.492 --> 19:23.594
You, her, your model
planes and nudie books.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.329
Sorry, Seymour.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.332
Now I can't look at you
without picturing it.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.934
Oh, my room's
not that bad.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.170
I'm talking
about your mother.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.373
(cackling)

19:35.375 --> 19:38.142
Hey, listen,
want to roast marshmallows?

19:38.144 --> 19:40.344
I'd like that.
Great, man, great.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.847
You're buying.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.282
(saxophone playing)

19:46.318 --> 19:48.019
Thank you, Simpson.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.654
That does
feel better.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.256
Fire looks
like it's dying down.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.194
BART:
Thanks, man.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.362
Well, I guess a lot of
women leave their men

19:58.364 --> 20:00.031
to go back and serve
in Afghanistan.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.033
No one drives 'em away
like you, Seymour.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.273
(saxophone playing)

20:10.742 --> 20:13.544
Well, no more
makeup for me. Ever!

20:13.546 --> 20:15.379
What about when

20:15.381 --> 20:17.381
you're blowing your stupid horn
at Carnegie Hall?

20:17.383 --> 20:21.052
(gasps)
If you say it out loud,
it won't come true!

20:21.054 --> 20:22.987
Carnegie Hall.
Carnegie Hall.
Carnegie Hall.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.056
(both grunting)

20:28.193 --> 20:30.361
Looks like someone's
still drinking the milk.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.763
(both grunting)

20:32.765 --> 20:34.899
(saxophone playing)

20:38.237 --> 20:40.438
(jazz playing)

21:18.243 --> 21:20.311
Shh!

21:23.115 --> 21:25.182
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:27.753 --> 21:29.620
You've just watched
The Simpsons.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.456
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:34.893 --> 21:37.395
MULDER:
They spy on us,
