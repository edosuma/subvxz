00:09.192 --> 00:14.781
In this critic's opinion, Mickey's
Good Time Tavern is anything but.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.576
Dismal decor, perfunctory service,

00:17.742 --> 00:21.663
and cuisine only marginally
preferable to hunger.

00:22.539 --> 00:24.624
And finally, on a sadder note,

00:24.791 --> 00:29.629
after 53 years,
Orsini's is closing its doors.

00:29.796 --> 00:34.426
Tonight, a sad adieu to the
grande dame of Seattle restaurants.

00:34.593 --> 00:38.638
I thought he was the grande dame
of Seattle restaurants.

00:38.805 --> 00:40.807
This is Gil Chesterton saying,

00:40.974 --> 00:45.270
"<i>Bon appetit, buon appetito</i>
and nifty noshing."

00:47.105 --> 00:50.859
- Why is Orsini's closing?
- The owner wants to sell.

00:51.025 --> 00:56.614
And Orsini's is like wine
that's stayed too long in the cellar -

00:56.781 --> 00:59.242
only memories of its former glory.

00:59.409 --> 01:02.370
- Not comping your cheque?
- Not for months now.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.625
Orsini's was my favourite restaurant.
Ever been?

01:07.792 --> 01:10.628
My typical date's idea
of a gourmet evening

01:10.795 --> 01:14.340
is take out, make out
and home by Letterman.

01:16.509 --> 01:20.013
- Knock, knock.
- Show starts in two minutes.

01:20.179 --> 01:24.475
Look at the John Steinbeck I bought
at the rare book fair.

01:24.642 --> 01:27.520
"St Katy The Virgin",
in like-new condition.

01:27.687 --> 01:30.356
She'd have to be, wouldn't she?

01:31.441 --> 01:34.152
It's a shame
more people haven't read it.

01:34.318 --> 01:38.447
- Let's see.
- Don't! You'll decrease its value.

01:38.614 --> 01:41.367
A thriving nightspot is closing its doors.

01:41.534 --> 01:44.036
Roz, you're moving.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.587 --> 01:56.173
No, Orsini's is closing.

01:56.340 --> 01:59.969
It can't be!
It's part of Crane history!

02:00.136 --> 02:04.056
Grandfather took me there
for my eighth birthday.

02:06.058 --> 02:08.894
- Thanks, Roz.
- Such vivid memories.

02:09.061 --> 02:11.272
Paper hats, singing Happy Birthday,

02:11.438 --> 02:14.483
sending back the veal Prince Orloff.

02:17.027 --> 02:19.071
30 seconds.

02:19.238 --> 02:22.658
Let's go to Orsini's
for a glorious farewell dinner.

02:22.825 --> 02:26.954
I'll make reservations.
We'll take Dad and Daphne.

02:27.121 --> 02:29.248
- Will Maris join us?
- Sadly no.

02:29.415 --> 02:33.252
One Christmas Eve
an Italian soccer team was there.

02:33.419 --> 02:37.715
Maris announced she was in the mood
for a goose and tragedy ensued.

02:58.944 --> 03:03.615
Dear God.
What has happened to this place?

03:03.782 --> 03:08.078
It's like running into a movie star
you once worshipped,

03:08.245 --> 03:13.250
only time has left her hair brittle,
her eyes sunken and dull,

03:13.417 --> 03:17.295
her skin waxy and sallow.

03:18.463 --> 03:21.091
I've got an appetite.
How about you, Daph?

03:22.008 --> 03:24.511
Yes, sir. Do you have a reservation?

03:24.678 --> 03:27.055
Yes. The name's Crane. For four.

03:27.597 --> 03:32.727
Table nine seems to be free.
Right this way, sir.

03:32.894 --> 03:37.607
- Your waiter will be here in a moment.
- Thank you. Here, Daphne.

03:37.774 --> 03:41.695
- Thank you.
- Dad, Frasier, isn't that Otto?

03:41.861 --> 03:45.073
My God, I believe it is!
Otto is legendary here.

03:45.240 --> 03:49.452
He never writes anything down.
He keeps it all in his head. Otto!

03:49.619 --> 03:52.122
Coming up.

03:54.082 --> 03:56.126
Your cheque, sir.

03:59.129 --> 04:02.173
Wrong table. We'd like menus, please.

04:02.340 --> 04:05.009
Sorry.
I hate it when we get crowded.

04:07.345 --> 04:09.806
I'm going to the john. Order me a beer.

04:09.973 --> 04:13.977
I thought you might surprise me
and order a glass of wine.

04:14.143 --> 04:17.605
I thought you might surprise me
and button your yap.

04:18.690 --> 04:22.986
I'd order him the crab cocktail
but the irony would be lost on him.

04:24.654 --> 04:27.573
They'll have trouble finding a buyer.

04:27.740 --> 04:32.995
Yes. One old relic whose time
has come to be put out of his misery.

04:33.162 --> 04:35.623
Oh, no, Otto, I didn't mean you.

04:35.790 --> 04:38.835
- Your menu, sir.
- Thank you.

04:39.001 --> 04:41.796
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

04:41.963 --> 04:45.049
- He's in the men's room.
- No, Otto!

04:46.968 --> 04:49.011
Leave it here.

04:53.015 --> 04:56.435
Why do Americans always
rush to tear things down?

04:56.602 --> 05:02.441
At home, we treasure antiquities.
You just bring in bulldozers.

05:02.608 --> 05:06.612
- I agree with Daphne.
- I'll try to contain my amazement.

05:08.114 --> 05:11.325
It's a crime to lose such a landmark.

05:11.492 --> 05:13.619
It's well-built, good structure.

05:13.786 --> 05:17.581
It does have good bones.
It's in a good location.

05:17.748 --> 05:21.710
- lf they only had valet parking.
- lf they took down those curtains.

05:21.877 --> 05:24.338
Knocked out these pillars.

05:25.256 --> 05:30.761
You know...I've always dreamed
of owning a four-star restaurant.

05:30.928 --> 05:33.389
What growing boy hasn't?

05:34.473 --> 05:39.186
- We'd need a new chef.
- The chef at Emilio's is unhappy.

05:39.353 --> 05:42.356
Yes! The man's scungili
is a cry for help.

05:43.232 --> 05:45.859
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

05:46.026 --> 05:49.571
I'm picking out china
and sandblasting the wine cave.

05:50.364 --> 05:56.119
It can be hard work - if you don't
scald yourself or lop off a finger,

05:56.286 --> 05:59.122
you're gagging at grease fires,

05:59.289 --> 06:02.876
killing rats and brawling
with labour racketeers.

06:04.503 --> 06:07.422
Me auntie had a little tearoom.

06:09.466 --> 06:14.012
You're not gonna do a dumb-ass thing
like buying this place?

06:14.179 --> 06:17.432
With all respect,
we're not neophytes in this field.

06:17.599 --> 06:22.437
- We know food and wine.
- We have style, taste and refinement.

06:22.604 --> 06:27.484
But you guys never think about
the hard work or the long hours.

06:27.651 --> 06:31.154
To you, owing a restaurant
is fancy clothes,

06:31.321 --> 06:34.616
hobnobbing with friends
and turning enemies away.

06:34.783 --> 06:37.244
I hadn't even thought about that!

06:38.328 --> 06:41.623
When I was a cop,
there was this restaurant.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.834
In 10 years, it changed hands 20 times.

06:45.001 --> 06:49.464
It was Ling Fung's Lychee Palace,
then Tony's Meatball Hutch,

06:49.631 --> 06:52.801
then, A Taste Of Yorkshire -
English food.

06:52.967 --> 06:56.221
Big surprise -
that lasted about five minutes.

06:57.597 --> 07:00.600
He's right. People lose money
in this business

07:00.767 --> 07:03.520
because they pick the wrong name.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.484
But I was thinking about it
while Dad was talking.

07:12.570 --> 07:16.157
Maison Crane.
You're right, it's too obvious.

07:16.324 --> 07:19.077
We want our name to be inviting.

07:20.119 --> 07:23.373
What's the word for "light-hearted"
in French?

07:23.539 --> 07:25.667
There isn't one.

07:26.626 --> 07:28.670
I've got it, Niles!

07:28.836 --> 07:31.381
Les Frères Heureux.

07:31.547 --> 07:34.384
The Happy Brothers! Brilliant!

07:34.550 --> 07:38.721
Homey and just hard enough
to pronounce to intimidate riffraff.

07:39.972 --> 07:42.183
We'll make it very exclusive.

07:42.350 --> 07:46.145
No sign, no advertising,
and an unlisted phone number.

07:46.312 --> 07:49.106
And you could post guards on the roof

07:49.273 --> 07:52.151
to shoot people as they try to get in!

07:53.569 --> 07:56.030
- I believe. Do you believe?
- I believe.

07:56.197 --> 08:02.286
- What would you like?
- The whole damned place!

08:02.453 --> 08:04.997
And for the lady?

08:10.753 --> 08:12.797
(Up tempo piano music plays)

08:25.726 --> 08:27.937
(Niles) We're a palpable hit.

08:28.103 --> 08:34.235
We're full, except for that table in that
dank corner next to the men's room.

08:34.400 --> 08:40.240
That is not a dank corner.
That is the enchanted grotto.

08:40.407 --> 08:42.909
I've had nothing but compliments.

08:43.077 --> 08:47.414
Chef Maurice has outdone himself.
The menu cannot be improved upon.

08:47.581 --> 08:52.544
Unless it would be to add a soupçon
of brandy to the Cherries Jubilee.

08:55.923 --> 08:58.842
I want those cherries to be jubilant.

09:00.761 --> 09:02.888
Daphne, Dad, everything OK?

09:03.055 --> 09:07.017
Oh, yes. Whatever this <i>anguilla</i> is,
it's smashing.

09:07.184 --> 09:10.938
Our chef can do things with eels
you wouldn't believe.

09:11.104 --> 09:13.232
I arrested a guy for that once.

09:15.025 --> 09:17.110
You really pulled it off, Dr Crane.

09:17.277 --> 09:22.199
Sorry to disappoint you, Dad, but
it seems the restaurant is a success.

09:22.366 --> 09:25.619
By tomorrow,
it'll be the toast of Seattle.

09:31.249 --> 09:33.293
- What's in there?
- <i>Anguilla.</i>

09:33.460 --> 09:35.128
Dear God!

09:35.295 --> 09:40.717
Maurice likes to kill them to order,
then serve them with the heads on.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.596
Thank God his speciality
isn't roast beef.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.435
- Are those soufflés for table nine?
- I'm about to bake them.

09:50.602 --> 09:53.521
I shouldn't second-guess presentation,

09:53.688 --> 09:57.275
but would you be averse to trying
something radical?

09:57.442 --> 09:58.818
What?

09:58.985 --> 10:05.158
Instead of individual soufflés, bake a
large soufflé and serve it at the table.

10:05.325 --> 10:09.537
When people hear "Niles Crane",
I want them to think "big soufflé'.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.916
As you wish.

10:14.959 --> 10:19.005
- There's a party without a reservation.
- Leave them to me.

10:19.172 --> 10:21.507
Hey, Niles, baby!

10:21.674 --> 10:26.387
- Mr Briscoe. May I help you?
- Does it look like I need help?

10:27.680 --> 10:29.724
Do you have a reservation?

10:29.891 --> 10:33.895
I know what you're sniffing for.
These guys are all alike.

10:34.062 --> 10:38.191
Mr Lincoln wonders if you've
a table for me and the lady.

10:38.358 --> 10:40.401
Mr Lincoln's in luck.

10:40.568 --> 10:44.113
Please seat these people
in the enchanted grotto.

10:45.073 --> 10:49.952
The grotto? Oh, Bulldog!
Enjoy our finest table.

10:51.412 --> 10:54.415
A flash of green
and you get what you want.

10:54.582 --> 10:56.834
But look who I'm telling!

11:06.177 --> 11:09.847
Maurice? It's not to
second-guess your creativity,

11:10.014 --> 11:16.645
but...l thought we agreed we'd
serve the soufflé in individual cups?

11:16.812 --> 11:19.482
- I was asked to change.
- On opening night?

11:19.648 --> 11:22.568
Good Lord, no.
Start pouring, man.

11:25.613 --> 11:29.200
lf you're almost finished,
I'll call for your car.

11:29.366 --> 11:31.827
Your parking attendant
looked familiar.

11:31.994 --> 11:36.123
It was Otto, the waiter.
Didn't have the heart to let him go.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.210
- Hello, Otto.
- (Otto) 'Who is this?'

11:41.253 --> 11:43.964
It's Dr Crane. Please bring up car 44.

11:45.591 --> 11:50.054
My innovation. This way your car
will be waiting when you're finished.

11:59.188 --> 12:02.149
We agreed one large bowl for soufflé.

12:02.316 --> 12:04.526
This is crazy! This is my kitchen!

12:04.693 --> 12:07.446
It's in my restaurant! One big bowl!

12:08.614 --> 12:13.577
Table 12 is still waiting. Don't
force me to send them free zucchini.

12:13.744 --> 12:16.788
- That's the "in" door.
- What did I hit?

12:16.955 --> 12:22.210
- What happened?
- Help me get him into the kitchen.

12:22.544 --> 12:25.213
That's the "out" door.

12:25.380 --> 12:28.884
- No harm done.
- His nose is broken.

12:29.051 --> 12:32.262
- What shall we do?
- Start ladling out zucchini.

12:32.429 --> 12:36.433
- He's out cold!
- I'll take them to the emergency room.

12:40.645 --> 12:43.106
I'm trying to remain
a happy brother,

12:43.273 --> 12:47.861
but suddenly
we're without waiters or a bartender.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.655
First rule of the kitchen. Remain calm.

12:50.822 --> 12:55.660
- No, I told you individual cups, you oaf!
- I told him one large bowl!

12:55.827 --> 12:58.079
Are you out of your mind?

12:58.246 --> 13:01.166
Why not just serve it
in a baseball glove?

13:01.333 --> 13:05.545
Ridiculous! How gauche!
I didn't know you had this streak!

13:05.712 --> 13:08.923
Maurice! No, wait!
Please let me finish!

13:09.090 --> 13:12.594
- It was an oversight.
- Now what?

13:12.761 --> 13:17.515
We make a battlefield promotion.
Congratulations. Our new head chef.

13:17.682 --> 13:21.895
- Thank you.
- We've a very important clientele.

13:22.061 --> 13:25.148
Two senators and
the head of the Immigration Bureau.

13:26.024 --> 13:28.067
<i>Sacre bleu!</i>

13:38.786 --> 13:40.997
Any other names you'd like to drop?

13:42.081 --> 13:44.625
Fine, now we have no chef.

13:46.419 --> 13:49.714
No. No. Put the hat down.

13:49.881 --> 13:51.966
You are our new head chef.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.218
I can't cook all this food.

13:54.385 --> 13:59.348
Most of the meals are started.
Dad and Daphne can help us out.

13:59.515 --> 14:02.685
- Otto, cancel car 44.
- (Otto) 'Who is this?'

14:03.728 --> 14:06.731
Dr Crane! It's always Dr Crane!

14:10.401 --> 14:13.529
We need your help.
We've got a little disaster.

14:13.696 --> 14:15.573
Disaster?

14:17.616 --> 14:20.286
The staff walked out.

14:20.453 --> 14:23.247
I need you in the kitchen
and you behind the bar.

14:23.414 --> 14:25.458
You can gloat later.

14:25.624 --> 14:27.793
I'll pencil it in.

14:29.211 --> 14:32.548
It's not the first time
I've washed up for me supper.

14:32.715 --> 14:34.842
Who'll wait on these tables?

14:35.009 --> 14:37.511
Oh, Frasier.

14:37.678 --> 14:39.513
Roz!

14:42.725 --> 14:46.228
I'm glad to see you, too. My date, Brad.

14:46.395 --> 14:49.023
- Pleasure.
- Pretty great, huh?

14:49.189 --> 14:54.278
- Have you got our special table?
- First, I want to discuss something.

14:54.445 --> 14:57.990
- It's probably some surprise.
- Try to fool you!

14:58.157 --> 15:01.744
- What's your poison?
- I'll wait for Roz.

15:01.910 --> 15:04.121
I'd have one now.

15:04.788 --> 15:06.832
Blackmailer!

15:07.750 --> 15:10.711
Honey, I'm really sorry,

15:10.878 --> 15:13.380
but Frasier's waiters
had a terrible accident

15:13.547 --> 15:16.967
and he really needs my help.

15:17.134 --> 15:20.512
- I hope you'll try to understand.
- No problem.

15:20.679 --> 15:23.640
Could I get a menu
and some bread and butter?

15:27.519 --> 15:30.856
You from around here?
How about those Supersonics?

15:33.567 --> 15:37.154
Niles is panicking.
I don't know if we can pull this off.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.865
Just tell them what happened.

15:40.031 --> 15:42.826
People are more understanding
than you think.

15:43.744 --> 15:46.663
Maybe honesty is the best policy.

15:48.707 --> 15:51.001
Everyone!

15:51.168 --> 15:56.715
Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen,
I would just like to say...

15:56.882 --> 16:01.303
- Good evening, Frasier.
- <i>Bon appetit!</i>

16:01.469 --> 16:05.223
Gil, I thought you never reviewed
opening nights.

16:05.390 --> 16:11.312
I made an exception and brought
an entire table of restaurant critics.

16:11.479 --> 16:15.233
Oh, well, that's...lovely.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.652
I don't know if I can accommodate you.

16:17.819 --> 16:20.780
We'll take that one over there.

16:20.947 --> 16:25.743
We're salivating to try <i>anguilla.</i>
I hear chef's a wizard with eels.

16:25.910 --> 16:30.415
Eels? That was his old speciality.

16:30.582 --> 16:32.750
You must try his new speciality.

16:32.917 --> 16:36.045
Scrambled eggs.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.507
Eels it is.

16:39.674 --> 16:43.594
Table four now want
Sole Veronique without grapes,

16:43.761 --> 16:47.015
spinach instead of broccoli,
risotto instead of pasta.

16:47.181 --> 16:52.520
- They also want...
- Just tell them, "No substitutions"!

16:52.687 --> 16:56.232
- I have trouble saying no.
- So the guidebooks tell us.

16:57.525 --> 17:02.196
- Do you want to get thrown in the tank?
- You're not making this very easy.

17:02.363 --> 17:07.410
You waltz in here, la-di-da,
"extra broccoli, hold the capers,"

17:07.577 --> 17:09.704
then you go out on the fun side.

17:09.871 --> 17:12.790
You want to trade places?
Be my guest.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.836
How dare you use that tone?

17:19.422 --> 17:21.549
All right, stop it!

17:22.717 --> 17:28.973
You're not being asked to do anything
you've never done in your own homes.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.684
Now, quick, Niles, kill five eels!

17:31.851 --> 17:33.894
Wait!

17:36.647 --> 17:38.482
What?

17:38.649 --> 17:42.444
Every restaurant critic in Seattle
wants <i>anguilla.</i> Kill eels!

17:42.611 --> 17:45.197
How do you suggest I do that?

17:45.364 --> 17:49.326
You're the chef!
Throw a toaster in the damn tank!

17:51.161 --> 17:54.123
Not to worry. Eels are on their way.

17:54.290 --> 17:58.210
- Our mouths are watering.
- Our chef is in the process of...

18:05.050 --> 18:07.594
frying them now.

18:07.761 --> 18:13.183
Excuse me, this is Veal Piccata.
I ordered Veal Marsala.

18:13.350 --> 18:17.354
I'll rectify that at once.
I'll be right back.

18:17.521 --> 18:20.941
Niles, this Veal Piccata
has to be Veal Marsala.

18:30.659 --> 18:33.578
The mayor's table all want
Cherries Jubilee.

18:33.745 --> 18:37.082
Fine. You flame them.
How are those eels?

18:37.249 --> 18:39.418
I'm just trimming them now.

18:39.584 --> 18:43.672
- Take them out of the tank!
- Not till I'm sure they're dead!

18:43.839 --> 18:46.800
For heaven's sakes!

19:00.272 --> 19:02.649
What was that?

19:03.775 --> 19:07.445
Big blue flash. Cherries everywhere.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.245
Lucky it didn't set off
the sprinkler system.

19:15.412 --> 19:20.959
We have a safety delay for this -
15 seconds before the sprinklers...

19:24.003 --> 19:26.339
kick in.

19:27.590 --> 19:30.051
- Where do I turn it off?
- Over there.

19:30.218 --> 19:34.472
I hope you're satisfied!
You thinned my brown sauce.

19:36.683 --> 19:39.936
Good news! That was just a test!

19:41.938 --> 19:46.776
- I want my car! Now!
- Yes, ma'am, right away.

19:46.943 --> 19:49.821
Otto, bring car 23. Hurry!

19:49.988 --> 19:52.824
- (Otto) 'Who is this?'
- It's the voice of God!

19:52.991 --> 19:55.952
Doc, great touch with the sprinklers!

19:56.119 --> 19:59.747
My date's dress is clinging to her
like saran wrap!

19:59.914 --> 20:06.003
Every restaurant has to adjust.
You'll remember this as an adventure!

20:06.170 --> 20:09.298
And if they don't remember it,
I'll remind them.

20:11.467 --> 20:16.055
Please keep us in mind
for your next special occasion.

20:16.222 --> 20:19.767
We plan exciting innovations
in the weeks to come.

20:26.107 --> 20:30.277
Starting with...
our drive-through window.

20:33.572 --> 20:35.825
Number 23 is ready.

20:49.964 --> 20:54.802
How much firepower is necessary
to embed a cherry in a ceiling tile?

20:56.929 --> 20:59.390
Another question we should have asked

20:59.556 --> 21:03.352
before entering
the exciting world of food service.

21:04.311 --> 21:07.856
Those eels are starting to stink!

21:09.566 --> 21:14.279
Dad, you've circled like a shark.
Just give us your speech.

21:14.446 --> 21:19.326
You guys will punish yourselves
enough without me chiming in.

21:20.494 --> 21:23.163
- Thanks.
- Hey, I'm your dad.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.294
Hello, Happy Brothers Restaurant.

21:30.212 --> 21:35.384
Table for two? No problem. Smoke
damaged or non-smoke damaged?

21:39.972 --> 21:45.310
You know, we could tell people
he died in the explosion.

21:53.819 --> 21:58.907
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

21:59.074 --> 22:00.784
# Mercy!

22:00.951 --> 22:07.749
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:07.916 --> 22:14.673
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:14.839 --> 22:16.925
# They're calling again #

22:17.092 --> 22:20.220
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

22:20.387 --> 22:24.224
# What is a boy to do? #

22:24.391 --> 22:27.894
Good night everybody!
