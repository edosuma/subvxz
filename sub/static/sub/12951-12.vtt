WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:04.668
Previously on "Alias"...

00:04.669 --> 00:06.535
I have a crush on a guy at work.

00:06.536 --> 00:08.669
Really? Who is he?

00:08.670 --> 00:10.235
Someone in my department.

00:10.236 --> 00:12.736
We've worked together
for about a year now.

00:12.837 --> 00:15.928
You're kidding me.
What's his name?

00:16.036 --> 00:18.537
Michael.

00:19.070 --> 00:20.303
What are you doing?

00:20.304 --> 00:22.136
Downgrading your
network privileges.

00:22.137 --> 00:24.967
Pending my investigation,
your security clearance

00:25.070 --> 00:27.436
has been revoked.

00:27.437 --> 00:28.903
We have a situation.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.597
Ariana Kane, head of
Alliance counterintelligence

00:31.704 --> 00:34.465
is investigating me in
the murder of Emily Sloane.

00:34.572 --> 00:36.371
I did not kill Emily Sloane.

00:36.372 --> 00:37.671
But I do have secrets.

00:37.672 --> 00:40.467
The last thing I can afford,
Sydney can afford,

00:40.572 --> 00:44.265
is someone discovering that my
loyalty does not lie with SD-6.

00:45.172 --> 00:47.672
Kane needs someone to blame.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.971
since she can't find
who murdered Emily,

00:49.972 --> 00:52.006
she's decided to blame me.

00:52.007 --> 00:54.507
I did not murder your wife.

00:54.606 --> 00:58.402
If I don't find who did,
Kane will frame me for it.

00:58.507 --> 01:00.206
I have some leads.

01:00.207 --> 01:02.506
I need you
to pursue them for me.

01:02.507 --> 01:04.339
Can I trust you to do that?

01:04.340 --> 01:05.773
Of course.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.373
This will stay between us.

01:08.941 --> 01:10.173
Hello?

01:10.174 --> 01:12.574
Agent Kane. Arvin Sloane.

01:12.575 --> 01:15.439
Jack Bristow
just left my house.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.808 --> 01:29.331
- I want to report a murder.
- sit down.

01:33.043 --> 01:35.142
Where was this murder committed?

01:35.143 --> 01:37.700
San Francisco.
Last night.

01:37.809 --> 01:40.309
Who was murdered?

01:41.210 --> 01:45.074
I have five names.
Alliance partners.

01:45.177 --> 01:47.609
I need their whereabouts
and phone records

01:47.610 --> 01:49.909
for the dates listed.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.043
I've included
dead drop instructions.

01:52.044 --> 01:56.033
Assume the usual protocols
have been compromised.

02:01.778 --> 02:05.369
Are you quite sure this is as
important as you make it appear?

02:05.479 --> 02:07.979
Take it easy.

02:37.447 --> 02:39.947
Dad, get in!

02:57.549 --> 02:59.849
- What are you doing?
- Kendall contacted me

02:59.850 --> 03:02.116
because you hadn't signaled in.

03:02.117 --> 03:04.016
Alliance is after me.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.383
Alliance? Dad, what the hell
is going on?

03:06.384 --> 03:09.077
Someone extorted $100 million.
They think that person is me.

03:09.217 --> 03:11.774
Mountaineer, you've got company.

03:11.916 --> 03:14.116
Outrider paralleling you
one block west

03:14.117 --> 03:16.810
and a pursuit vehicle
100 feet behind.

03:18.018 --> 03:19.549
How long have you known?

03:19.550 --> 03:21.183
It didn't concern you.

03:21.184 --> 03:24.809
If The Alliance thinks
you're lying, they'll kill you.

03:24.917 --> 03:28.815
What concerns me is having them
suspect you're my accomplice.

03:48.753 --> 03:50.119
Take your next left.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.620
Now!

04:00.754 --> 04:02.387
Take your next right.

04:02.388 --> 04:04.888
Your ride's a half
a block ahead.

04:31.990 --> 04:33.255
Several months ago,

04:33.256 --> 04:35.881
The Alliance offered
Sloane a partnership.

04:35.990 --> 04:38.615
In exchange,
he had to kill his wife.

04:38.723 --> 04:41.245
Because Emily had learned
the truth about SD-6?

04:41.357 --> 04:43.757
He poisoned her.

04:43.758 --> 04:45.957
Or so he thought.

04:45.958 --> 04:49.321
Soon after the funeral, Sloane
began receiving odd messages.

04:50.425 --> 04:54.653
Messages designed to indicate
that his efforts had failed.

04:54.759 --> 04:57.987
Followed soon after
by a terrifying delivery.

04:58.092 --> 05:00.592
Proof she was still alive.

05:03.292 --> 05:05.358
In exchange,
they demanded money.

05:05.359 --> 05:07.859
$100 million.
Which The Alliance paid.

05:07.925 --> 05:10.948
And the blackmailer
killed her anyway.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.753
The Alliance has to find
someone to blame.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.192
So, why focus on you?

05:15.193 --> 05:17.259
I was no more
a suspect than anyone.

05:17.260 --> 05:20.692
But as they examined my conduct,
they realized I had secrets.

05:20.794 --> 05:23.817
Elements of my alibi that,
because of our work for CIA,

05:23.961 --> 05:25.893
I can't fully justify.

05:25.894 --> 05:27.826
Sloane. Does he think
you did this?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.993
I'm not certain.

05:29.994 --> 05:31.893
What are you gonna do?
Stay here?

05:31.894 --> 05:34.621
For the moment.

05:34.728 --> 05:37.956
The man at the theater had
information about The Alliance,

05:38.062 --> 05:40.789
intel I'm not sure
the CIA can access.

05:40.895 --> 05:42.194
It's SD-6.

05:42.195 --> 05:44.695
- You have to go.
- I'm calling in sick.

05:44.696 --> 05:46.161
No, Sydney, you can't.

05:46.162 --> 05:47.961
The agent heading up
the investigation

05:47.962 --> 05:50.621
is not interested in you.
Not yet.

05:50.729 --> 05:54.252
But if you don't show up,
it will arouse her suspicions.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.897
We can't allow that to happen.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.899
Okay, let's be honest.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.233
Among life experiences
to be avoided,

06:51.234 --> 06:53.893
getting kidnapped definitely
ranks near the top.

06:54.001 --> 06:56.501
Except, actually,
third grade kind of sucked.

06:56.601 --> 06:59.795
There was this whole
lunch money thing with...

06:59.934 --> 07:03.388
That's all right.
I kind of overdid it, but...

07:03.535 --> 07:04.667
you saved my bacon.

07:04.668 --> 07:07.168
Thank you.

07:07.835 --> 07:09.734
Marshall, thank you.

07:09.735 --> 07:12.101
Don't worry about it.
It's... oh, um...

07:12.102 --> 07:14.602
Mr. Dixon, I really
never have an occasion

07:14.603 --> 07:16.535
to buy another man
a present, uh,

07:16.536 --> 07:19.297
except my father
at Father's Day. Um, but...

07:19.403 --> 07:21.835
Anyway, it's cologne.

07:21.836 --> 07:22.735
Thank you.

07:22.736 --> 07:25.236
It's a nice scent.
It's gonna be nice on you.

07:25.303 --> 07:29.235
Not that you need a new scent.
Your natural scent's really...

07:29.337 --> 07:30.002
Marshall.

07:30.003 --> 07:32.136
You know, I'll be quiet now.

07:32.137 --> 07:34.637
I'd appreciate that.

07:35.570 --> 07:37.270
Actually, um, Mr. Sloane,

07:37.271 --> 07:39.771
I notice you're not wearing
the tie I gave you.

07:41.471 --> 07:43.237
That's okay.

07:43.238 --> 07:45.003
You're looking at a prototype

07:45.004 --> 07:47.595
of the Triad's most startling
achievement to date.

07:47.705 --> 07:50.899
Quantum gyroscope
missile guidance system.

07:51.005 --> 07:53.271
According to
the partial specifications

07:53.272 --> 07:54.804
we were able to intercept,

07:54.805 --> 07:57.896
not only is this device cheap
and easy to manufacture,

07:58.005 --> 07:59.605
but it is far more accurate

07:59.606 --> 08:02.039
than anything
in our current arsenal.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.006
It is capable of transforming
a '70s-era scud

08:05.140 --> 08:07.970
into a precision-guided munition

08:08.073 --> 08:11.233
with range and lethality
equivalent to a cruise missile.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.006
How did we get these photos?

08:13.007 --> 08:15.564
Last month, SD-5 tasked
a team of agents

08:15.673 --> 08:17.073
to perform a recon op

08:17.074 --> 08:19.767
on the Triad's R&D lab
in Nice, France.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.601
Your task is acquisition.

08:22.708 --> 08:25.206
Here we have Karl Schatz.

08:25.207 --> 08:26.874
He's a courier for Triad,

08:26.875 --> 08:30.000
and he's transporting
the prototype to Berlin

08:30.108 --> 08:31.474
for mass production.

08:31.475 --> 08:34.134
You will intercept it en route.

08:34.241 --> 08:36.408
There is no room
for failure on this one.

08:36.409 --> 08:37.941
Imagine the consequences

08:37.942 --> 08:41.374
if enemies of the United States
acquire this technology.

08:42.376 --> 08:45.365
There are so many things
I hate about Arvin Sloane.

08:45.510 --> 08:47.275
The thing that I hate the most

08:47.276 --> 08:50.265
is the way he wraps his
criminal activity in the flag.

08:50.376 --> 08:52.109
We won't let him
get away with it.

08:52.110 --> 08:54.610
We'll make a defective copy
of that gyroscope

08:54.710 --> 08:55.909
to give to SD-6.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.243
- We'll need photographs.
- Dixon has them.

08:58.244 --> 09:01.267
- He's on his way to Nice.
- We'll get a team to France.

09:01.377 --> 09:03.877
When you're through, make sure
you're holding the gyroscope.

09:03.878 --> 09:06.010
We'll duplicate it on-site.

09:06.011 --> 09:07.810
Syd, you should know that

09:07.811 --> 09:11.039
we've been doing everything
we can to help your father.

09:12.545 --> 09:15.136
You've been helping my father?

09:15.278 --> 09:15.878
Yeah.

09:15.879 --> 09:19.039
You knew The Alliance
was investigating my father?

09:19.146 --> 09:20.944
- Yes.
- For how long?

09:20.945 --> 09:22.944
Two weeks.

09:22.945 --> 09:24.844
- I understand you're upset.
- I am.

09:24.845 --> 09:27.470
Your father explained
why we hadn't told you.

09:27.579 --> 09:29.412
It was a question
of your safety.

09:29.413 --> 09:31.878
He was almost killed.
I saved him.

09:31.913 --> 09:34.538
I didn't want you
to have more on your mind.

09:34.646 --> 09:35.912
It was a judgment call.

09:35.913 --> 09:37.912
That you've been
making for months.

09:37.913 --> 09:41.004
Involving you had no upside.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.545
You didn't tell me about Manolo
or discussions with my mother.

09:44.647 --> 09:47.613
You didn't even tell me
you were seeing Alice again.

09:47.747 --> 09:49.746
Wait. What is this about?

09:49.747 --> 09:51.980
Me being too old to be coddled.

09:51.981 --> 09:53.714
Your life is complicated.

09:53.715 --> 09:56.408
Forgive me for trying
to make it easier.

09:56.515 --> 09:59.015
I don't need you for that.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.218
Jack...

10:53.219 --> 10:55.878
I'm sending this through
a secure server. I'm sorry.

10:56.019 --> 10:57.452
I informed Ariana Kane

10:57.453 --> 10:59.852
that you visited
my house last night.

10:59.853 --> 11:02.648
Not because I believe
you're guilty. I don't.

11:02.753 --> 11:05.219
But because I had to.

11:05.220 --> 11:07.153
This past summer,

11:07.154 --> 11:09.654
when I was initiated
into The Alliance,

11:09.754 --> 11:12.254
a device was implanted
into my neck.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.820
It was a means
of ensuring loyalty

11:14.854 --> 11:16.353
among Alliance partners.

11:16.354 --> 11:18.854
Among other things,
this device tracks

11:18.888 --> 11:21.911
my whereabouts
as well as my vital signs.

11:23.155 --> 11:25.554
It also transmits
my conversations

11:25.555 --> 11:27.088
back to The Alliance.

11:27.089 --> 11:30.486
So, you see, they already knew
you'd been to see me.

11:30.622 --> 11:32.654
You offered many suspects,

11:32.655 --> 11:35.121
but all your leads
were dead ends.

11:35.122 --> 11:37.522
Now I offer one of my own.

11:37.523 --> 11:42.217
Last year, I murdered a member
of The Alliance, Jack.

11:42.322 --> 11:44.822
Jean Briault.

11:46.689 --> 11:49.655
You can understand why I was
reluctant to reveal this.

11:49.757 --> 11:51.189
It is quite possible

11:51.190 --> 11:53.985
that the blackmailer
was stirred by revenge,

11:54.091 --> 11:56.589
that he, or she,

11:56.590 --> 11:59.090
was close to Briault.

12:00.957 --> 12:03.457
Stay safe, Jack.

12:04.358 --> 12:06.858
Good luck.

12:07.425 --> 12:09.925
Briault has a wife
and an adult son,

12:10.025 --> 12:12.525
but neither would have
had the insight

12:12.526 --> 12:14.558
to blackmail The Alliance.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.218
And the other partners
considered Briault soft.

12:17.325 --> 12:19.425
No one was sad to see him go.

12:19.426 --> 12:21.926
So you have nothing.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.259
Are you considering
witness protection?

12:24.260 --> 12:26.760
That would leave Sydney exposed.

12:26.793 --> 12:27.925
You'd take her.

12:27.926 --> 12:31.688
Have her spend her life
looking over her shoulder?

12:32.427 --> 12:36.825
If you're not here to say
goodbye, why did you bring this?

12:36.927 --> 12:39.427
I need someone
to brainstorm with.

12:40.428 --> 12:43.622
Surely the CIA has teams
who specialize in these matters.

12:43.728 --> 12:45.960
Forensics, profilers.

12:45.961 --> 12:48.461
Yes, they do.

12:52.562 --> 12:56.654
Have information resources
pull everything on Briault.

13:04.862 --> 13:08.658
I understand that you requested
Sydney Bristow's computer.

13:08.763 --> 13:11.888
Well, three months ago,
Agent Dixon reported evidence

13:11.997 --> 13:13.796
suggesting she was
a double agent.

13:13.797 --> 13:15.463
That was a misunderstanding.

13:15.464 --> 13:19.362
She was executing an operation
that Jack had authorized.

13:19.464 --> 13:22.453
Yes, I read your report.

13:22.564 --> 13:27.121
I think either she was
an accomplice to his blackmail.

13:27.231 --> 13:29.992
Or else the two of them have
been up to something

13:30.098 --> 13:33.030
more long-term.

13:33.131 --> 13:35.631
Bristow frequently
assigns his daughter

13:35.665 --> 13:38.324
to operations
of his own design.

13:38.465 --> 13:41.226
Sydney Bristow
is an excellent agent.

13:41.366 --> 13:46.230
All the more reason
he would enlist her help.

13:56.367 --> 13:59.992
Once you recover the gyroscope,
you and Dixon will separate.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.000
Our team will be in this room,

14:02.001 --> 14:04.831
where they'll duplicate
the gyroscope.

14:04.934 --> 14:06.633
Any questions?

14:06.634 --> 14:08.434
You should go over it again.

14:08.435 --> 14:11.832
It's pretty complicated.
Maybe you could make it easier.

14:11.967 --> 14:13.667
- I don't want to be here.
- Hey!

14:13.668 --> 14:15.467
Look who's
joining you in France.

14:15.468 --> 14:16.567
Hey.

14:16.568 --> 14:19.295
"Hey"? Three months
in the hospital, I get "hey"?

14:19.402 --> 14:22.266
- How about a little sugar?
- I'm glad you're back.

14:22.369 --> 14:23.468
Thank you.

14:23.469 --> 14:24.868
Thank you for the plant.

14:24.869 --> 14:27.268
Amazingly, I've been able
to keep it alive.

14:27.269 --> 14:29.769
Bring me up to speed.
What's our plan?

14:32.969 --> 14:35.469
I should get to my plane.

14:36.703 --> 14:39.203
I'll see you in France.

14:40.403 --> 14:42.903
Okay.

14:52.771 --> 14:54.904
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

14:54.905 --> 14:57.598
Une contribution?

14:58.238 --> 15:01.068
Monsieur.

15:01.172 --> 15:03.672
Merci beaucoup.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.871
Nothing yet, Syd.

15:05.872 --> 15:08.531
- No sign of the courier.
- Copy that.

15:08.639 --> 15:11.139
Just let me know when to move.

15:12.473 --> 15:13.505
You know what?

15:13.506 --> 15:15.338
What?

15:15.339 --> 15:17.238
I've already made 47 Euros.

15:18.473 --> 15:20.973
Merci.

15:22.573 --> 15:25.073
Hey.

15:25.074 --> 15:27.767
- Sure you don't want to talk?
- Nothing to talk about.

15:27.873 --> 15:30.273
- I share my fights with you.
- No, you don't.

15:30.274 --> 15:32.106
When Alan pissed
in the living room?

15:32.107 --> 15:35.073
- That was your dog.
- I let you know how upset I was.

15:35.175 --> 15:37.307
I appreciate you trying
to cheer me up.

15:37.308 --> 15:40.172
Here's a thought.
Tell her how you feel.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.107
I know.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.340
I said this is a line
you don't cross.

15:44.341 --> 15:46.274
That was before I nearly died.

15:46.275 --> 15:48.775
You know what they say
about the white light?

15:48.875 --> 15:50.774
They're wrong.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.275
It's darkness.

15:55.843 --> 15:58.343
Darkness.

15:58.776 --> 16:00.375
I understand.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.570
Game time, Syd.
Here comes our guy.

16:11.710 --> 16:14.301
Gyroscope is in a harness
under his left pec.

16:14.410 --> 16:16.410
You can use the Artful Dodger.

16:16.411 --> 16:18.843
Right.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.867
If it's not in his briefcase
and it's in his pocket,

16:21.977 --> 16:24.477
here is a goody
every pickpocket can use.

16:24.478 --> 16:26.877
I call this baby
the Artful Dodger.

16:26.878 --> 16:29.810
After that movie, um...

16:29.945 --> 16:31.378
- "Oliver!"
- Right.

16:31.379 --> 16:33.578
"Please, sir,
can I have some more?"

16:33.579 --> 16:34.645
I love that movie.

16:34.646 --> 16:36.845
So, you just turn
this guy like that,

16:36.846 --> 16:39.607
slip it on, turn it around,
and this little guy

16:39.712 --> 16:42.234
will cut through anything.

16:43.946 --> 16:46.446
Damn it.
I liked this tie.

16:50.047 --> 16:51.412
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

16:51.413 --> 16:53.412
Une contribution
pour les enfants?

16:53.413 --> 16:56.641
- Non, merci.
- Pour les enfants, monsieur.

16:57.448 --> 16:59.948
Better hurry, Syd.

17:10.714 --> 17:13.214
Syd, move.

17:15.315 --> 17:21.339
# The waves keep on crashin'
on me for some reason #

17:22.749 --> 17:25.249
How you doin'?

17:25.550 --> 17:27.415
Oh, oh, oh. Whoa.

17:29.183 --> 17:31.683
It wasn't me.

17:38.417 --> 17:42.543
This damn machine. That happens
every time I go through these.

17:46.018 --> 17:47.417
Whatever.

17:47.418 --> 17:49.417
Merci.

17:49.418 --> 17:50.850
Et vous.

17:50.851 --> 17:52.818
At JFK, I went through
five times.

17:52.819 --> 17:55.979
They literally had me
take off my shirt.

17:57.052 --> 17:58.951
# You hold me
like you should #

17:58.952 --> 18:02.043
# So I'm gonna keep on
dancin' #

18:07.820 --> 18:10.285
Oh, my God.

18:10.286 --> 18:13.740
Watch the hand. Hey.
It's not a date.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.081
I see. You want
to get your thrills?

18:18.187 --> 18:19.186
Ooh.

18:19.187 --> 18:21.687
Excusez-moi.

18:22.454 --> 18:27.182
# So don't wake me
if I'm dreamin' #

18:31.855 --> 18:33.053
Merci, mademoiselle.

18:33.054 --> 18:35.554
Thank you.

18:39.155 --> 18:41.188
Good work.
I'll see you in L.A.

18:41.189 --> 18:44.985
# Let's just keep on dancin' #

18:49.556 --> 18:50.822
Good work.

18:50.823 --> 18:52.456
Base ops, this is Boy Scout.

18:52.457 --> 18:55.820
Mountaineer's delivered.
We're proceeding with the copy.

18:55.923 --> 19:00.253
They're estimating two hours
till the duplicate's ready.

19:09.224 --> 19:11.323
Listen, do you
want to go to dinner?

19:11.324 --> 19:15.051
When we were driving in, I saw
this place. Rousseau, I think.

19:15.192 --> 19:17.692
Vaughn, we...

19:18.392 --> 19:19.558
We can't do that.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.257
Why not?

19:21.258 --> 19:23.157
Well...

19:23.158 --> 19:24.791
for a million reasons.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.849
If Alliance sees us together,
they'll kill us.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.724
The nearest cell is in Zurich.

19:29.725 --> 19:33.157
CIA tracks SD-6 security.
There haven't been signals.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.054
- You're serious.
- We've been to restaurants.

19:36.159 --> 19:39.091
We've met in parks,
convenience stores in L.A.,

19:39.193 --> 19:41.920
where we are much more
likely to be seen.

19:42.027 --> 19:44.891
Two things. One, I think
it's not that great a risk.

19:44.993 --> 19:47.493
Two, I am hungry.
I'm starving.

19:48.761 --> 19:52.022
We're gonna be together anyway.
Why can't we be eating?

19:52.128 --> 19:54.628
Aren't you hungry?

19:55.427 --> 19:57.927
Yeah, I'm hungry.

20:08.362 --> 20:10.862
- Let's do it.
- Yeah?

20:12.929 --> 20:14.562
I'm gonna change.

20:14.563 --> 20:16.728
That's a good idea.

20:16.729 --> 20:19.229
Okay.

20:22.629 --> 20:24.962
And?

20:24.963 --> 20:27.463
We're going to dinner.

20:29.564 --> 20:32.530
I'm gonna keep my comm open.
Monitor the R.F. frequency.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.930
Got it. In exchange,
I'll take an éclair.

20:34.931 --> 20:35.963
No, I'm serious.

20:35.964 --> 20:37.996
Any suspect signal,
I want to know.

20:37.997 --> 20:40.330
If they're small,
bring at least two.

20:40.331 --> 20:42.831
How we doing over here?

20:48.299 --> 20:50.531
Sydney Bristow
just left the airport

20:50.532 --> 20:52.498
accompanied by a man.

20:52.499 --> 20:54.999
Not Dixon.

20:55.632 --> 20:58.132
Find out who he is.

21:10.034 --> 21:12.591
Well, you speak French
almost as well as I do.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.100
Mademoiselle.

21:15.101 --> 21:17.601
Thank you.

21:18.634 --> 21:20.900
See what you like.
I'll be right back.

21:20.901 --> 21:23.401
Merci.

21:48.536 --> 21:51.400
- I think wine would help.
- I was thinking the same.

21:51.503 --> 21:54.003
S'il vous plait.

21:58.270 --> 22:01.758
There must be a dozen ways
to blackmail The Alliance.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.426
All of them far less
elaborate than this one.

22:04.571 --> 22:07.037
So we can assume
a secondary objective

22:07.038 --> 22:09.504
was to make Arvin suffer.

22:09.505 --> 22:12.562
Someone harboring
an acute hatred.

22:12.672 --> 22:15.229
Meaning it could be anyone.

22:16.005 --> 22:17.305
Does The Alliance have

22:17.306 --> 22:19.604
any permanent
operations in Peru?

22:19.605 --> 22:21.238
Peru? No. Why?

22:21.239 --> 22:22.772
Jean Briault.

22:22.773 --> 22:26.637
Whenever he traveled,
he would use his credit card.

22:26.739 --> 22:27.572
Except here.

22:27.573 --> 22:30.300
six times this past year
he went to Lima

22:30.406 --> 22:33.031
and not a single transaction.

22:33.173 --> 22:35.673
I think there's
a customs statement.

22:37.507 --> 22:39.739
six arrivals
into Chavez Airport.

22:39.740 --> 22:43.399
Each time, he declared
$70,000 in cash.

22:43.507 --> 22:44.506
Why?

22:44.507 --> 22:47.098
What's he doing
with all that money?

22:47.208 --> 22:49.901
No investments.
He's not buying art.

22:50.808 --> 22:52.841
He was running
his own syndicate?

22:52.842 --> 22:55.141
One The Alliance
wasn't aware of.

22:55.142 --> 22:57.937
He can't wire his agents
operational money.

22:58.042 --> 23:01.530
The Alliance will spot that.
So he bankrolls them in Peru.

23:01.642 --> 23:03.842
Assume we're right.

23:03.843 --> 23:06.570
Why would they want
revenge for his murder?

23:09.043 --> 23:10.708
I'll have customs send over

23:10.709 --> 23:13.109
all arrivals
and departures into Peru

23:13.110 --> 23:16.099
for one week on either side
of Briault's visits.

23:18.810 --> 23:21.310
When I was your wife...

23:24.277 --> 23:27.175
...I would meet my case officer
in his hotel room.

23:29.744 --> 23:33.403
I suggest you find out
where Briault stayed

23:33.511 --> 23:36.204
and pull the hotel
security footage.

23:51.946 --> 23:54.278
I heard you on the phone
with base ops.

23:54.279 --> 23:56.112
Your code name is Boy Scout.

23:56.113 --> 23:57.612
Yeah.

23:57.613 --> 23:59.445
Why?

23:59.446 --> 24:03.139
It goes back to CST.
Clandestine Service Training.

24:03.247 --> 24:06.042
- You don't want to hear this.
- Vaughn.

24:06.147 --> 24:09.738
- The Boy Scouts have a motto.
- Always be prepared.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.678
On my first day, I had
forgotten my field manual.

24:12.814 --> 24:15.746
The instructor said,
"That is your one screwup.

24:15.848 --> 24:19.644
- Be prepared. "
- This story is a disaster.

24:19.748 --> 24:21.948
Tell her she's pretty.
Are you an idiot?

24:21.949 --> 24:24.744
I'm gonna turn you
off now. Goodbye.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.547
Sorry.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.105
He's not SD-6.

24:29.216 --> 24:31.716
Check U.S. DMV.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.948
What makes you think
he's American?

24:33.949 --> 24:36.449
What makes you think he isn't?

24:41.150 --> 24:44.673
So, who's our mystery man?

24:55.151 --> 24:57.651
Tell me about your pets.

24:58.084 --> 24:58.883
What?

24:58.884 --> 25:01.611
I want to know about
every pet you've ever had.

25:07.119 --> 25:09.284
Look at that.

25:09.285 --> 25:11.785
Michael Vaughn.

25:13.085 --> 25:14.585
U.S. Department of State.

25:14.586 --> 25:16.218
Son of a bitch.

25:16.219 --> 25:18.719
He's CIA.

25:25.019 --> 25:26.919
Playing pool.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.420
I can see it.

25:30.221 --> 25:32.721
We should play sometime.

25:34.687 --> 25:36.786
So, you liked everything?

25:36.787 --> 25:38.520
C'etait tres bon. Merci.

25:38.521 --> 25:40.420
Parfait.

25:40.421 --> 25:44.285
So, uh, it is too late for you
to set out for Avignon.

25:44.387 --> 25:47.046
And, uh, you had much to drink.

25:47.155 --> 25:49.985
Upstairs, I have an inn.

25:50.088 --> 25:52.221
And tonight, you are my guests.

25:52.222 --> 25:54.354
Please.

25:54.355 --> 25:56.421
Take your time.

25:56.422 --> 25:58.922
Merci.

26:10.290 --> 26:12.790
Did you ask him to do that?

26:17.491 --> 26:20.616
There are so many issues,
I don't know where to begin.

26:20.724 --> 26:24.679
I think we should have
an open mind about this.

26:25.824 --> 26:28.023
An open mind.

26:28.024 --> 26:30.922
It'd be rude to overlook
such a generous offer

26:31.024 --> 26:34.581
without proper consideration.

26:36.792 --> 26:38.824
I wouldn't dream of it.

26:38.825 --> 26:40.191
Okay.

26:40.192 --> 26:42.692
- But there are clearly issues.
- Yes.

26:42.693 --> 26:45.193
I don't disagree.

26:54.926 --> 26:57.426
Okay.

27:01.460 --> 27:03.327
Okay, right on time.

27:06.894 --> 27:08.360
Go ahead, base ops.

27:08.361 --> 27:09.527
Infosec just called.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.660
Interpol reported
a network intrusion.

27:11.661 --> 27:15.855
Someone hacked into U.S. DMV
and downloaded Vaughn's info.

27:15.962 --> 27:18.519
Both attacks
originated from Nice.

27:20.129 --> 27:21.695
Boy Scout, do you copy?

27:21.696 --> 27:23.461
Boy Scout,
this is field station.

27:23.462 --> 27:24.728
Do you respond?

27:24.729 --> 27:27.195
What's the name
of that restaurant?

27:27.196 --> 27:28.828
What's the name?

27:28.829 --> 27:31.095
Monsieur, vous avec
un telephone.

27:31.096 --> 27:33.596
Merci.

27:35.063 --> 27:37.362
- Hello?
- Get out of there now!

27:37.363 --> 27:39.863
Syd, behind you!

27:45.064 --> 27:47.564
Go! Go!

28:18.533 --> 28:21.033
Gun. Toss it over.

28:24.634 --> 28:26.733
On your knees!
Hands behind your head!

28:26.734 --> 28:28.800
Down!

28:28.801 --> 28:30.967
- Down!
- Get down!

28:30.968 --> 28:32.200
Potesh, Jonathan.

28:32.201 --> 28:34.300
I.D. 6-Tango-5,
Charlie David.

28:34.301 --> 28:36.994
Patch me through to Los Angeles.
Ariana Kane.

28:52.369 --> 28:54.468
Mrs. Kane.

28:54.469 --> 28:56.969
Hello?

28:56.970 --> 28:59.202
Hello? Hello?

29:06.403 --> 29:08.736
Take the car.
I'll have Weiss pick me up.

29:08.737 --> 29:10.903
I'll pick up the copy
of the gyroscope.

29:10.904 --> 29:14.700
We're aborting.
SD-6 is gonna investigate.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.598
They can't prove anything,
but we can't deceive them.

29:17.705 --> 29:20.432
We have to give SD-6
what they want,

29:20.538 --> 29:23.368
as dangerous as that is.
You know that.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.670
We were so stupid.

29:25.671 --> 29:26.670
It's my fault.

29:26.671 --> 29:28.204
That's not true.

29:29.706 --> 29:32.206
You have to go.

29:38.173 --> 29:40.673
I'll see you back in L.A.

30:07.041 --> 30:09.141
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:09.142 --> 30:11.241
This your debrief for Kendall?

30:11.242 --> 30:13.742
Yeah.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.208
Okay, you can't
show him this.

30:16.209 --> 30:17.641
No, I'm serious.

30:17.642 --> 30:20.369
He needs to know why
SD-6 has the real gyroscope.

30:20.510 --> 30:21.675
I agree.

30:21.676 --> 30:24.176
But this requires
a little creativity.

30:24.309 --> 30:26.108
Tell him it was my fault, okay?

30:26.109 --> 30:27.709
Tell him that, um,

30:27.710 --> 30:30.971
grinding the lenses took
a little longer than expected.

30:31.077 --> 30:32.675
I won't let you cover for me.

30:32.676 --> 30:34.676
I'm not.
It's partially my fault.

30:34.677 --> 30:36.643
I told you to take
her on a date.

30:36.644 --> 30:38.309
You told me to tell her
how I feel.

30:38.310 --> 30:40.810
I'm three months past
a near-death experience.

30:40.844 --> 30:42.610
What were you
listening to my advice for?

30:42.611 --> 30:45.736
I'm recommending that I be
replaced as her case officer.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.110
Okay, now you're
just being stupid.

30:48.111 --> 30:49.277
I'm sorry, but...

30:49.278 --> 30:51.778
I nearly blew our operation
inside SD-6,

30:51.879 --> 30:53.878
not to mention putting
Sydney's life in danger.

30:53.879 --> 30:56.709
She wanted to go to dinner.
She knew the risks.

30:56.812 --> 30:58.612
My judgment was compromised.

30:58.613 --> 31:00.445
Not to mention the damage

31:00.446 --> 31:02.778
that you and Sydney
have done to SD-6.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.411
Maybe all that work was done

31:04.412 --> 31:07.606
because of the way you guys
feel about each other.

31:08.247 --> 31:10.747
How's that for spin?

31:12.846 --> 31:15.346
That's not bad.

31:15.347 --> 31:16.846
Whatever you decide,

31:16.847 --> 31:19.347
make sure you discuss this
with Sydney first.

31:19.447 --> 31:21.947
I mean, this affects her, too.

31:32.548 --> 31:33.714
Anything?

31:33.715 --> 31:35.614
Whenever Briault went to Peru,

31:35.615 --> 31:38.081
he stayed at Hotel Cerocontidad.

31:38.082 --> 31:40.912
We're scanning everyone
who passes through the lobby.

31:41.015 --> 31:42.481
If he met with any assets,

31:42.482 --> 31:45.209
they'll show up
on the federal database.

31:45.315 --> 31:46.648
This is Briault?

31:46.649 --> 31:48.515
That's him last February.

31:48.516 --> 31:50.848
That's him 2001, November.

31:50.849 --> 31:53.349
2001, September.

31:53.350 --> 31:54.982
Stop. Who's that with him?

31:54.983 --> 31:56.415
Can we enhance this?

31:56.416 --> 31:58.849
The shadows are pretty severe.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.316
- I can boost the gamma.
- Are they together?

32:01.317 --> 32:03.874
Let me try something here.

32:04.017 --> 32:06.517
This won't be perfect.

32:16.718 --> 32:18.917
Jack, I just saw McCarthy.

32:18.918 --> 32:20.518
Did he tell you about Kane?

32:20.519 --> 32:22.151
She and Briault
were having an affair.

32:22.152 --> 32:24.085
I can't stand that I didn't
put that together.

32:24.086 --> 32:25.451
He says you're going to SD-6.

32:25.452 --> 32:27.252
To prove Kane
blackmailed The Alliance.

32:27.253 --> 32:28.851
And you know this how?

32:28.852 --> 32:32.340
The very day Sloane handed over
$100 million in bearer bonds,

32:32.453 --> 32:34.352
Kane opened an account
in Monaco.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.217
The contents are protected
by privacy laws,

32:37.319 --> 32:39.910
but SD-6 utilizes
their cover as Credit Dauphine

32:40.053 --> 32:42.386
to acquire access
to that information.

32:42.387 --> 32:45.012
If I get on their network,
I can verify her balance.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.386
This is based on your assumption

32:46.387 --> 32:48.978
that Kane parked $100 million
in the bank.

32:49.088 --> 32:52.451
My point is, if you're wrong,
they'll kill you.

32:52.554 --> 32:55.486
Let me contact the director.
The CIA can verify the account.

32:55.588 --> 32:59.020
He'd have to get counsel to sign
off. That's minimum 48 hours.

32:59.121 --> 33:01.487
I may be safe,
but if they haven't already,

33:01.488 --> 33:03.821
they'll soon begin
to suspect Sydney.

33:03.822 --> 33:06.322
But I appreciate the offer.

33:26.357 --> 33:28.523
Jack Bristow's here.
In the building.

33:28.524 --> 33:30.623
Security log shows
two minutes ago.

33:30.624 --> 33:33.124
Seal the exits.
No one leaves.

33:33.191 --> 33:35.691
Who monitors closed-circuit?

34:00.193 --> 34:01.825
- Jack.
- Can I help you?

34:01.826 --> 34:04.326
Yes. Come with us, please.

34:21.761 --> 34:24.261
Hello, Jack.

34:24.828 --> 34:27.418
There's a plane waiting
to take us to London,

34:27.529 --> 34:30.222
but I thought we should wait
for your daughter

34:30.328 --> 34:32.828
before we left.

34:33.996 --> 34:37.688
I came here to investigate
a blackmail, but...

34:37.795 --> 34:42.193
you've proven far more
compelling than a simple thief.

34:43.429 --> 34:46.985
I know what you did.

34:47.130 --> 34:49.630
Do you?

34:50.164 --> 34:53.289
I'm eager to hear
what that may be.

34:54.963 --> 34:56.696
Sodium pentothal.

34:56.697 --> 34:59.595
Won't take more than
a few minutes.

34:59.697 --> 35:02.424
Then we'll talk about Sydney.

35:22.733 --> 35:24.331
Five minutes longer,

35:24.332 --> 35:26.199
and I would have
told everything.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.598
Sydney and I would have been
revealed as double agents

35:28.599 --> 35:30.132
and killed.

35:30.133 --> 35:33.530
Fortunately, Sloane saw
the e-mail that I sent him,

35:33.634 --> 35:36.429
detailing what I discovered.

35:39.300 --> 35:42.697
Ariana Kane had, in fact,
deposited the bearer bonds

35:42.800 --> 35:45.300
into that Monaco account.

35:45.834 --> 35:48.664
But only long enough
to convert them into cash,

35:48.768 --> 35:51.996
which she then
transferred out.

35:52.102 --> 35:54.201
And have they
recovered the cash?

35:54.202 --> 35:55.667
Not yet.

35:55.668 --> 35:57.800
Arvin never questioned
why you ran?

35:57.801 --> 36:00.301
No. He realizes
Kane was on a witch hunt.

36:00.369 --> 36:02.668
That running
was a valid option.

36:02.669 --> 36:04.801
In fact, he's taking a week off

36:04.802 --> 36:07.791
and leaving me in charge
while he's gone.

36:08.602 --> 36:11.102
Thank you for everything.

36:14.203 --> 36:16.636
There is one thing
that strikes me as odd.

36:16.637 --> 36:18.036
Yes. Me too.

36:18.037 --> 36:20.537
You said Sloane
requested Kane to investigate.

36:20.637 --> 36:21.969
The one person who had

36:21.970 --> 36:24.003
an apparent motive
for blackmail.

36:24.004 --> 36:25.870
Someone easy to frame.

36:25.871 --> 36:28.136
Interesting theory.

36:28.137 --> 36:30.637
Or not.

36:37.338 --> 36:38.504
Hey.

36:38.505 --> 36:40.871
Hey. What did Kendall say?

36:40.872 --> 36:42.604
He told me about your father.

36:42.605 --> 36:45.038
He didn't mention anything
about our date,

36:45.039 --> 36:46.438
if that's what you mean.

36:46.439 --> 36:50.462
- Have you written your debrief?
- No, not yet.

36:50.573 --> 36:53.232
If I tell the truth,
at the least,

36:53.339 --> 36:55.572
they'll remove me
as your case officer.

36:55.573 --> 36:58.266
But despite what we did,
how stupid we were,

36:58.374 --> 37:00.874
I know we do good work.

37:00.973 --> 37:02.872
We need to stay together.

37:02.873 --> 37:05.373
I agree.

37:05.374 --> 37:07.874
We do good work.

37:13.241 --> 37:14.706
I don't understand.

37:14.707 --> 37:18.002
When I got back to SD-6
and saw my father,

37:18.108 --> 37:20.274
it was clear no one
would ask questions

37:20.275 --> 37:22.208
about Kane's missing agents.

37:22.209 --> 37:25.971
So I gave Sloane
the counterfeit gyroscope.

37:26.075 --> 37:28.575
This is the real one.

37:31.276 --> 37:32.909
We win.

37:32.910 --> 37:34.909
At the airport,
you took them both.

37:34.910 --> 37:37.410
Always be prepared.

37:45.610 --> 37:49.440
So, I had a blood test today.
For the health insurance.

37:49.544 --> 37:51.776
There was this guy
there giving blood.

37:51.777 --> 37:54.076
He was kind of cute,
so I look over,

37:54.077 --> 37:55.210
and I smile at him.

37:55.211 --> 37:57.711
And guess what happens.

37:58.011 --> 38:00.011
He fainted.

38:00.012 --> 38:02.178
You just guessed that he...

38:02.179 --> 38:04.077
It's a blood-sugar thing.

38:04.078 --> 38:05.211
Okay, well, fine.

38:05.212 --> 38:07.973
Before I realized that,
I was pretty psyched.

38:08.112 --> 38:09.977
I was thinking,
"Wow, my smile

38:09.978 --> 38:12.842
made a man
go weak in the knees. "

38:12.946 --> 38:14.845
Hey, how was, uh...

38:14.846 --> 38:17.971
Any news about that guy
Michael from work?

38:20.079 --> 38:21.812
No.

38:21.813 --> 38:24.313
And there's not gonna be.

38:24.980 --> 38:28.275
I realized it's not worth
fantasizing about.

38:30.114 --> 38:32.773
Nothing's ever gonna come of it.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.447
Right.

38:39.015 --> 38:40.613
Okay.

38:40.614 --> 38:43.114
Get your coat.
We're going for cocktails.

38:43.115 --> 38:44.481
- Oh, no.
- I'm serious.

38:44.482 --> 38:46.780
You need the biggest
Cosmopolitan.

38:46.781 --> 38:48.347
Up, up, up, girl.

38:48.348 --> 38:49.514
We're gonna go out.

38:49.515 --> 38:51.347
We're gonna paint this town.

38:51.348 --> 38:53.848
Shake this off.

39:39.719 --> 39:41.218
Damn, I'm good.

39:41.219 --> 39:42.418
It's working?

39:42.419 --> 39:43.852
What did I tell you?

39:43.853 --> 39:47.182
You asked if this was possible.
I said give me three months.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.552
Look at that.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.386
89 days later.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.686
- They can't hear us?
- Nope.

39:52.687 --> 39:55.847
The hard part was cracking
the spread spectrum algorithm.

39:55.954 --> 39:59.943
The transmission in here has to
match their receivers exactly.

40:00.054 --> 40:01.220
You see that?

40:01.221 --> 40:03.053
That's the switch.

40:03.054 --> 40:04.886
What are my associates hearing?

40:04.887 --> 40:07.020
I programmed in ambient sounds.

40:07.021 --> 40:08.620
Rain, TV chatter.

40:08.621 --> 40:12.348
Now you're cruising down the
405, listening to Miles Davis.

40:12.454 --> 40:14.976
- And biorhythms?
- Piece of cake.

40:15.088 --> 40:17.588
EKG readings,
breathing patterns...

40:17.622 --> 40:20.452
you're as steady
as Charlie Watts.

40:22.289 --> 40:24.189
$10 mil.

40:24.190 --> 40:26.690
Holy God.

40:29.423 --> 40:31.789
Must feel good.

40:31.790 --> 40:32.589
What's that?

40:32.590 --> 40:36.454
Being able to speak freely.
Nobody knowing your business.

40:36.557 --> 40:38.190
Yeah.

40:38.191 --> 40:40.691
It does.

41:19.294 --> 41:21.794
We did it.

41:28.494 --> 41:30.394
Are you sure?

41:30.395 --> 41:32.327
Are you sure it worked?

41:32.328 --> 41:34.828
Yes, my love.

41:35.828 --> 41:38.328
We're free.
