WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:04.439
Is it just me,
or is Dolores

00:04.526 --> 00:06.180
a little too old to
be wearing a skirt

00:06.267 --> 00:06.876
that short
to a meeting?

00:06.963 --> 00:08.965
Yeah.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.575
When you're 70,

00:10.662 --> 00:13.056
you should not shop
at Forever 21.
[laughs]

00:13.143 --> 00:14.449
And I don't think
she was wearing underwear.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.233
Oh, I was sitting
across from her.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.800
She wasn't.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.715
It looked like cotton
candy down there.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.675
Oh, God, somebody
should tell her.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.373
Yeah? How'd that go?
"Dolores, honey,

00:25.460 --> 00:27.027
lower the skirt
or trim the witch broom."

00:29.159 --> 00:30.856
That's good.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.554
Or, you know,
just go right at it.

00:32.641 --> 00:34.295
"Cross your legs, granny,

00:34.382 --> 00:36.036
I can see your yammy."

00:36.123 --> 00:37.472
[laughing]

00:37.559 --> 00:39.517
Granny? Yammy?

00:39.604 --> 00:40.518
Nothing?

00:40.605 --> 00:42.477
Sorry.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.347
I'm a little
preoccupied.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.523
Is everything okay?

00:45.610 --> 00:47.351
Oh, sure.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.310
Other than,
you know,

00:49.397 --> 00:50.050
having cancer.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.052
[laughing]

00:52.139 --> 00:54.097
Oh, you're
not laughing.

00:56.969 --> 00:59.102
What kind?

00:59.189 --> 01:00.321
Breast.

01:00.408 --> 01:01.844
But we caught
it early,

01:01.931 --> 01:04.455
so there's a good chance
I'll be okay.

01:04.542 --> 01:05.630
Well, that's
great news.

01:05.717 --> 01:06.805
Yeah, that's great.

01:06.892 --> 01:09.112
Wow.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.158
Cancer.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.899
Sorry.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.162
Don't you dare
treat me differently.
No.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.989
Of course not. No.
No.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.346
Remind me on
the way home

01:25.433 --> 01:26.564
I gotta pick up
some brownie makings

01:26.651 --> 01:28.305
for Roscoe's
bake sale tomorrow.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.786
You're actually gonna start
baking at 11:00 at night?

01:30.873 --> 01:32.396
I know,
it's a nightmare.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.877
Not like what
you're going through.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.401
Oh.
Here you go.

01:37.488 --> 01:38.576
What are you doing?

01:38.663 --> 01:39.969
What?
She told us

01:40.056 --> 01:40.665
not to treat her
any differently.

02:01.512 --> 02:04.211
Oh, it's awful
about Marjorie, huh?

02:04.298 --> 02:05.690
Yeah.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.127
I mean, she doesn't
look sick.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.084
[sighs]

02:08.170 --> 02:09.738
She did order soup.

02:09.824 --> 02:12.175
That is the official food
of sick people.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.526
Or maybe she's
making it up.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.572
Who makes up cancer?

02:17.659 --> 02:18.921
I did once.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.577
You know, I-I didn't
want to hurt
a guy's feelings.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.709
Then I ran into him five years
later at a Costco.

02:24.796 --> 02:27.321
Tried to tell him
it was a miracle.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.410
Who'd have thought
that would backfire?

02:29.497 --> 02:33.065
I know, I never
go to Costco.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.635
I just never know what
to do in these situations.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.768
Do you think she noticed
I didn't give her a hug?

02:39.855 --> 02:41.378
Yeah, what was
that all about?

02:41.465 --> 02:43.424
I panicked halfway in.

02:43.511 --> 02:46.601
I didn't want to...
smoosh the cancer.

02:48.951 --> 02:51.562
Well, the fist bump
was an odd choice.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.782
[sighs]

02:53.869 --> 02:55.479
God.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.525
It really puts our problems
in perspective.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.004
Yeah.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.571
Everything seems small
by comparison.

03:00.658 --> 03:01.703
Right?

03:01.790 --> 03:02.356
We need to be more grateful.

03:02.443 --> 03:03.270
Amen.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.968
[honks horn]

03:06.055 --> 03:07.230
Green means go,
stupid!

03:07.317 --> 03:09.319
Starting now.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.852
Hey.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.463
Oh. Hi.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.163
I was just checking
myself in the bathroom.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.164
How'd you do?

03:28.251 --> 03:29.600
I think I'm okay.

03:29.687 --> 03:30.819
I, uh... I got
a couple of freckles

03:30.906 --> 03:32.560
I'm gonna keep
an eye on.

03:32.647 --> 03:33.561
You?

03:33.648 --> 03:34.866
I'm good.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.738
Just made myself
a little horny.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.349
VIOLET:
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

03:39.436 --> 03:40.872
What's that about?

03:40.959 --> 03:42.483
She's 17
and pregnant.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.180
I'm surprised she doesn't
do that all day.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.530
[sighs]

03:46.617 --> 03:48.402
[knocking at door]

03:48.489 --> 03:49.794
Hello?

03:49.881 --> 03:51.361
Oh, come on!
Lock the door!

03:51.448 --> 03:52.841
Oh, no, no.
No.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.060
I'm trying to put 'em on,
not take 'em off.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.366
What?

03:56.453 --> 03:57.715
None of my
stupid pants fit.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.848
Come on, put some
muscle into it!

03:59.935 --> 04:01.458
Aren't we squishing
the baby?

04:01.545 --> 04:02.459
The baby's fine.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.592
Button my damn pants!

04:04.679 --> 04:05.419
Help.

04:08.683 --> 04:09.727
Violet, you're pregnant.

04:09.814 --> 04:12.034
You had to know this was coming.

04:12.121 --> 04:14.210
I did, but I still
want to look hot.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.821
You were hot,
that's why you're pregnant.

04:16.908 --> 04:18.562
It's true.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.519
[sighs]

04:19.607 --> 04:22.000
Well, it's not fair.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.698
Not fair?
[laughs]

04:23.785 --> 04:24.829
Oh, I've got news for you,

04:24.916 --> 04:26.875
this is just the beginning.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.572
A couple of months from now,
you're gonna be packin' on

04:28.659 --> 04:29.617
another 30 pounds,
you'll have stretch marks,

04:29.704 --> 04:31.923
your boobs'll be enormous,

04:32.010 --> 04:33.621
and there's
hemorrhoids...
What's that
about the boobs?

04:33.708 --> 04:34.448
Shut up.

04:35.536 --> 04:36.624
And you know what?

04:36.711 --> 04:38.060
None of that stuff matters,

04:38.147 --> 04:39.975
because you're healthy.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.803
And healthy is everything.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.631
It's the most
important thing in the world.

04:43.718 --> 04:44.632
Yeah, I get it, but...

04:44.719 --> 04:46.286
But nothing!

04:46.373 --> 04:47.852
Now take those
stupid jeans off,

04:47.939 --> 04:50.159
put on some sweatpants
and pray for a C-section

04:50.246 --> 04:51.639
'cause that bundle of joy's

04:51.726 --> 04:54.511
gonna do some damage
on its way out.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.995
Bravo.

05:04.521 --> 05:08.133
[knocking at door]

05:13.617 --> 05:16.316
[knocking]

05:16.403 --> 05:17.317
Ooh, God.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.535
Oh, my God.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.842
Oh.

05:20.929 --> 05:23.061
I'm sorry to come
by so early,

05:23.148 --> 05:24.585
but I made brownies
for Christy

05:24.672 --> 05:26.021
for her son's
bake sale.

05:26.108 --> 05:27.936
What?
Yeah.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.198
They're labeled.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.200
Okay, these are
regular brownies,

05:31.287 --> 05:33.898
and these have no sugar,
no dairy and no gluten.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.857
I call them
"frownies."

05:38.076 --> 05:40.514
What?

05:40.601 --> 05:42.342
What's going on?

05:42.429 --> 05:46.476
Uh, Marjorie made brownies
for Roscoe's bake sale.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.044
Oh, thank God,
I completely forgot.

05:49.131 --> 05:49.784
Marjorie,
you saved my life.

05:49.871 --> 05:50.611
I mean...

05:53.483 --> 05:55.877
How's it going?

05:55.964 --> 05:57.313
Pretty good.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.619
Have a nice day.

05:58.706 --> 05:59.968
Wait, um...

06:00.055 --> 06:01.273
do you want to
come in for coffee?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.927
I can't.
I got a cab waiting

06:03.014 --> 06:04.581
to take me across town
for my chemo.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.104
Well, hang on,
just give me a second

06:06.191 --> 06:07.454
and I'll get dressed
and I'll take you.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.847
Oh, I don't want
to put you out.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.371
No, it's not
a problem.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.676
My daughter'll take
Roscoe to school.

06:12.763 --> 06:13.851
Mom, you want
to come with us?

06:13.938 --> 06:14.983
To chemo?

06:15.070 --> 06:17.072
You betcha.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.730
Okay. Thank you.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.862
I'll let the cab go.

06:26.821 --> 06:27.952
Oh...

06:28.039 --> 06:29.301
Do you believe her?
Mmm.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.694
She is in a fight
for her life

06:30.781 --> 06:32.130
and she still
finds the time

06:32.217 --> 06:33.828
to bake brownies
for my kid's school.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.004
Yeah, the woman
is a saint.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.397
[sighs] Thanks for
going with us.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.485
Well, what choice
did I have?

06:38.572 --> 06:40.138
She survives this,

06:40.225 --> 06:41.879
I don't need her
telling people
what a bitch I am.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.287
Oh, good news.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.636
This cancer clinic

06:59.723 --> 07:01.290
got four and a half stars
on Yelp.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.816
That's... great.

07:05.903 --> 07:07.339
Think about it.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.080
You gotta be alive
to write the review.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.391
Ooh, check it out.

07:15.478 --> 07:16.740
Angelina Jolie's
new boobs.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.046
Life gave her lemons,

07:18.133 --> 07:20.091
she turned them
into grapefruits.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.790
Speaking of which,

07:22.877 --> 07:24.226
have, uh, you thought
about new ones?

07:24.313 --> 07:25.619
What?

07:25.706 --> 07:26.881
[laughing]:
No.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.273
I'm doing chemo
and radiation

07:28.360 --> 07:29.623
to try and hang
on to these.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.407
Or... you could
go under the knife

07:31.494 --> 07:33.583
and wake up with
a perky new rack.

07:33.670 --> 07:36.499
My rack is fine.
Oh, please.

07:36.586 --> 07:37.674
You could tuck those
puppies into your belt.

07:42.723 --> 07:45.029
Mom, can you please talk
about something else?

07:45.116 --> 07:46.335
Sure.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.555
What's your plan
for the baldness?

07:50.818 --> 07:51.645
You know, they said
that might not happen.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.647
Oh, it's happening.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.563
You're gonna look like
a thumb in a housecoat.

07:56.650 --> 07:59.000
Why is she here?

07:59.087 --> 08:00.218
She's trying to help.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.613
Oh. Did not get that.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.834
Look, I say we start shopping
for wigs today.

08:06.921 --> 08:07.878
I don't think so.

08:07.965 --> 08:08.923
You sure?

08:09.010 --> 08:10.272
Curly blonde hair

08:10.359 --> 08:11.708
and some gummy bear
double "D"s,

08:11.795 --> 08:13.710
you might even get laid.
By a man.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.497
Mom, ease up.

08:17.584 --> 08:18.672
I'm sorry,
I'm just trying

08:18.759 --> 08:20.151
to lighten the mood.

08:20.238 --> 08:21.501
[sighs]

08:21.588 --> 08:23.459
What are gummy
bear breasts?

08:23.546 --> 08:24.982
The latest
in implants.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.811
Like a memory foam
mattress with nipples.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.033
Hi, Marjorie.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.337
Ready to start your treatment?

08:33.424 --> 08:34.514
Yes, we are.I'm ready, too.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.951
Come on.

08:37.038 --> 08:37.691
I'm her best friend.

08:37.778 --> 08:41.172
So am I.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.043
What do I need new boobs for?

08:42.130 --> 08:43.784
I have you two.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.441
Mommy's home.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.707
Oh, my God.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.710
I thought the cancer
clinic was depressing.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.542
Marjorie, how many
cats do you own?

09:02.629 --> 09:03.847
Oh, you don't own cats.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.936
You love them.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.634
Okay.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.723
How many cats
do you love?

09:09.810 --> 09:11.899
Well, let's see.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.465
That's Carlos Santana,

09:13.553 --> 09:15.163
and that's Grace Slick,

09:15.250 --> 09:16.512
and that's Boz Scaggs

09:16.599 --> 09:18.470
and Steve Miller,
and these three are

09:18.558 --> 09:20.124
the Tower of Power
horn section.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.389
This fat little
troublemaker...
[meows]

09:24.476 --> 09:26.304
is Jerry Garcia.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.697
So... eight.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.699
[cat meows]

09:29.786 --> 09:34.138
Oh, Marjorie, when did
you lose your way?

09:34.225 --> 09:35.313
I need to make them lunch.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.794
No, no, no.
You rest.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.491
We'll take care of it.[cat meows]

09:39.579 --> 09:40.797
Oh...

09:40.884 --> 09:41.929
Where do you keep
the cat food?

09:42.016 --> 09:43.757
I don't feed them cat food.

09:43.844 --> 09:47.195
Of course not.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.805
What do you feed them?
Well,

09:48.892 --> 09:51.329
there's a freshwater trout
in the fridge.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.200
You put that
in the blender,

09:52.287 --> 09:53.549
pulse until creamy,

09:53.636 --> 09:55.377
and then add rice
and veggies.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.119
Don't look at me.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.555
I'm not making
a sushi smoothie.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.733
Fine,
I'll do it.

10:04.821 --> 10:05.909
[sneezes]

10:05.996 --> 10:08.259
Oh, are you allergic to cats?

10:08.346 --> 10:10.000
A little.Since when?

10:11.567 --> 10:14.570
Since birth, Mom.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.791
With all
these cats,

10:17.878 --> 10:20.489
you're wise not
to have nice furniture.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.931
[whispering]:
I'm sorry.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.771
Hey, Christy, look.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.644
I'm Dolores.

10:55.089 --> 10:58.005
[snorks]

11:00.921 --> 11:01.965
[nasally]:
Chamomile with honey.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.228
Thank you.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.536
Did you, uh, make some tea
for me?

11:07.623 --> 11:10.060
Did I ever get a birthday party?

11:12.367 --> 11:14.978
[sneezes] Uh!

11:15.065 --> 11:17.981
So, listen,

11:18.068 --> 11:21.724
I was thinking that we could
call a couple of the girls

11:21.811 --> 11:25.685
from the meeting and have them
take turns helping you out.

11:25.772 --> 11:30.472
You know, shopping,
driving you to treatment...

11:30.559 --> 11:33.301
blending fish.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.346
I don't want
anyone else to know.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.044
Why not?

11:37.131 --> 11:38.219
Go away.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.268
Because I don't want

11:44.355 --> 11:46.270
anyone feeling sorry for me
because I'm sick.

11:46.357 --> 11:49.621
Oh, Marjorie, no one's gonna
feel sorry for you

11:49.709 --> 11:50.753
'cause you're sick.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.233
Yeah, they'll be sorry for you

11:52.320 --> 11:53.930
'cause you're
a crazy ol' cat lady.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.370
And if you're so concerned
about your privacy,

11:59.457 --> 12:00.720
why'd you tell us?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.200
Oh! Oh!

12:03.287 --> 12:05.115
Oh, please, scoot.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.556
Because you're
my closest friends.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.733
Oh, that's even sadder.

12:15.038 --> 12:18.650
Well, what about your son?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.957
Does he know?

12:21.044 --> 12:24.395
I haven't talked to him
in a long time.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.007
Maybe we could call him and...

12:27.094 --> 12:28.748
No, leave him alone.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.924
But I just think that...

12:31.011 --> 12:31.185
I said no!

12:32.882 --> 12:35.755
He has his life, I have mine.

12:37.234 --> 12:40.150
All right, fine.

12:41.282 --> 12:44.372
I gotta get to work.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.200
[sniffles, sighs]

12:46.287 --> 12:48.332
How do I look?

12:48.419 --> 12:50.073
Like death warmed over.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.337
No offense.

12:56.471 --> 12:59.300
Well, I will leave you in
the capable hands of my...

12:59.387 --> 13:02.520
I'll just leave you.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.958
[snorks]

13:10.006 --> 13:12.704
I don't suppose you
wanna make some tea for me.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.276
[sniffles]

13:19.363 --> 13:20.451
[clears throat]

13:25.195 --> 13:27.981
Cocaine?

13:30.287 --> 13:32.550
Cat dander.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.771
Mm. Is that what the kids
are calling it now?

13:38.556 --> 13:41.211
Why is the Japanese
family at table six

13:41.298 --> 13:42.169
wearing surgical masks?

13:42.256 --> 13:45.476
Because they're paranoid.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.524
Are you sick?

13:49.611 --> 13:51.526
Uh! No, I've got allergies.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.963
Well, either way,
you don't look too good.

13:54.050 --> 13:54.921
Maybe you should go home.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.314
Maybe I should, Gabriel.

13:57.401 --> 14:01.144
Maybe we should all go home
and be with our loved ones

14:01.231 --> 14:02.580
'cause death is coming!

14:02.667 --> 14:04.582
It's coming for you
and you

14:04.669 --> 14:06.976
and you and you!

14:12.329 --> 14:15.202
She seemed a lot less crazy
when I was sleeping with her.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.551
They all do.

14:25.255 --> 14:28.215
[door opens]

14:28.302 --> 14:30.043
Hey.
Hi.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.566
How was work?

14:31.653 --> 14:34.699
People paid me
to stay away from them.

14:39.704 --> 14:40.618
How's Marjorie?

14:40.705 --> 14:41.706
She's doing okay.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.579
I just put her
to bed.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.450
You stayed with her
the whole day?

14:46.537 --> 14:50.063
Yep. I made her dinner,
did the laundry,

14:50.150 --> 14:51.542
panned for cat nuggets

14:51.629 --> 14:53.849
in the kitty litter.
[clicks tongue]

14:53.936 --> 14:55.416
Wow.

14:55.503 --> 14:58.506
Look at you being all caring
and compassionate

14:58.593 --> 15:00.551
without rolling on ecstasy.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.599
I know.
I'm as surprised as you are.

15:04.686 --> 15:07.384
I just, I can't
help feeling

15:07.471 --> 15:08.908
the woman's getting
a raw deal.

15:08.995 --> 15:12.607
I mean, she's been
sober for 32 years,

15:12.694 --> 15:14.826
she's always there
for anybody who needs her.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.872
And what's her reward?

15:16.959 --> 15:17.568
Cancer.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.266
I know.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.877
You start thinking,
"What's the point?"

15:21.964 --> 15:23.226
It beats me.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.707
The unconditional
love of family?

15:25.794 --> 15:29.493
Ugh. Maybe.

15:29.580 --> 15:33.149
It's a compelling argument
for staying loaded till you die.

15:34.629 --> 15:37.414
Marjorie gave me that same look.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.605
Oh, God!

15:57.608 --> 15:59.132
Can I help you?

15:59.219 --> 16:02.439
Hi. I-I'm looking
for a Jerry Armstrong.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.658
That's me.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.181
Oh, okay, great.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.749
I'm Christy. I'm a friend
of your mother's.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.404
Not interested.

16:10.491 --> 16:11.840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.451
Um, I just want you to know

16:14.538 --> 16:17.454
that she's going
through a tough time.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.804
She's got cancer.

16:19.891 --> 16:23.156
Okay, now I know.

16:23.243 --> 16:24.505
Have a nice day.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.333
Oh come on.
She's your mother.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.422
Let me guess.

16:28.509 --> 16:31.294
You're one of her little
Anonymous friends.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.515
Yeah.

16:34.602 --> 16:38.127
Yeah. 12 simple steps
that let youoff the hook

16:38.214 --> 16:40.477
for ruining everyone's life.

16:42.653 --> 16:47.528
Well, there's more
to it than that.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.443
There's also coffee and cookies.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.276
Look, uh...

16:56.363 --> 16:58.669
let me tell ya something,
Christy.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.107
My mother was a drunk
and a drug addict

17:01.194 --> 17:03.500
who abandoned me
more times than I can count.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.589
So you'll have to excuse me
if I'm rooting for the cancer.

17:08.505 --> 17:11.073
Wow.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.119
That's a Mother's Day card
you don't see.

17:17.252 --> 17:19.429
Listen, Jerry,
I understand how you feel.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.910
I had the same kind of mom.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.565
But she's changed,
and I've changed.

17:24.652 --> 17:28.221
I've changed more.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.396
I'm actually a much better
person than she is.

17:29.483 --> 17:34.531
Well, uh, thanks for sharing.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.707
Are we done?

17:36.794 --> 17:41.799
You just need to know that your
mom is not like you remember.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.366
She's a warm and loving woman
who has helped

17:43.453 --> 17:46.587
a lot of people, including me.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.502
And a bunch of cats.

17:50.591 --> 17:53.768
Which you two seem
to have in common.

17:53.855 --> 17:54.421
Great.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.639
Bye.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.084
I saw that ending in a hug.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.567
The trick to forging
a signature

18:10.654 --> 18:14.441
is turning the original
upside down when you copy it.

18:14.528 --> 18:17.183
How'd you learn that?

18:17.270 --> 18:18.836
'Cause sometimes grandmas
have to write checks

18:18.923 --> 18:20.534
they're not supposed to.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.885
Sorry I'm late.

18:23.972 --> 18:24.755
Where were you?

18:24.842 --> 18:26.540
Doesn't matter.

18:26.627 --> 18:31.110
Look, this is gonna sound weird,
but I just want you guys

18:31.197 --> 18:32.850
to know that I love you

18:32.937 --> 18:35.157
and I am so happy
we're all together.

18:35.244 --> 18:38.465
Are you drinking again?

18:38.552 --> 18:42.599
Violet, you can't ask that
every time I say I love you.

18:42.686 --> 18:45.994
[sighs] Here, I stopped
to get you some new jeans.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.082
Really?

18:47.169 --> 18:49.040
Yeah, look.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.260
They're cute and they've
got a stretchy waist.

18:51.347 --> 18:52.043
Thanks.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.915
You're welcome.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.526
I'm sorry I was a little rough
on you the other day.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.528
It's okay.
No, it's not.

18:58.615 --> 19:02.053
I want you to visit me
when I'm dying.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.534
Sure.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.450
Great!

19:07.537 --> 19:10.627
Now, uh, what's going
on over here?

19:10.714 --> 19:11.672
Tell her.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.630
I flunked my math test.

19:13.717 --> 19:14.892
Oh, Roscoe, you gotta apply
yourself!

19:14.979 --> 19:16.546
Otherwise,
you're gonna...!

19:17.678 --> 19:18.635
[sighs]

19:18.722 --> 19:21.247
Okay, let me start over.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.423
You are a very smart
young man,

19:23.510 --> 19:26.121
and I know that
you will do better
next time.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.167
I doubt it.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.301
Do you need me to sign it?

19:32.388 --> 19:33.911
That's okay.

19:33.998 --> 19:34.999
Grandma's teaching me
to forge your signature.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.697
Really?I don't think

19:36.784 --> 19:40.309
he can fool a bank,
but he can sure
fool a teacher.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.717
Thanks for getting
all dolled up for my chemo.

19:56.804 --> 20:00.808
Oh, this?
Just threw it on.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.985
Oh, please, you're trying
to bag that cute doctor.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.770
Say again. I couldn't
hear you over your boobs.

20:08.946 --> 20:12.776
Regardless, I'm really glad
you're both here.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.275
He's gay.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.020
[text alert sounds]

20:45.026 --> 20:45.722
Oh, my God.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.464
What?

20:48.551 --> 20:51.380
I just got a text from my son.

20:53.426 --> 20:54.905
He wants to see me.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.043
That's great.
