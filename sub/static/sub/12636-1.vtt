See ya.

00:25.792 --> 00:29.328
Aw... Can I keep him?

00:30.330 --> 00:33.298
Yes, let's take him home.

00:39.939 --> 00:41.940
Go ahead, you can pick one out.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.643
Thanks, dad.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.524
I want this one.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.092
Now, you sure, honey?

01:00.160 --> 01:02.828
Make sure you
take good care of him.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.363
I will.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.910
Good luck, little guy.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.330
Beat it, filthy mutt!

02:11.397 --> 02:13.031

02:53.907 --> 02:56.842
Look at the size of that one.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.317
Ok, big fella.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.320
Nice and easy, now.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.721
There he goes!

03:09.789 --> 03:11.657
Call for backup now!

03:23.436 --> 03:25.304
We have a 5-1-1 in progress.

03:59.706 --> 04:02.341
Hey, he got away from us again!

Let's get him!

04:16.456 --> 04:17.389
Woman: Oh, my clothes!

04:17.457 --> 04:20.058
He's destroying
my vintage clothes!

04:26.866 --> 04:29.935
Cut him off!
Cut him off!

04:30.003 --> 04:31.603
Where's my backup?

04:31.671 --> 04:35.374
I want every available
unit out here now!

04:36.509 --> 04:39.144
Easy. Relax.

04:42.248 --> 04:44.049
Good job.

04:50.156 --> 04:52.524
Only 2 more issues to go.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.832
Morning, mom.
Morning, dad.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.035
Hi, honey.
Hey, son.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.639
Good morning, honey.

05:08.775 --> 05:09.841
Calvin, trash
goes out this morning.

05:09.909 --> 05:14.079
It's covered, dad!

05:14.147 --> 05:16.148
Figg, yeah, man.

05:16.215 --> 05:17.749
I'm running a couple
minutes late.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.884
Adjust my schedule
accordingly. All right.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.719
Calvin!

05:20.753 --> 05:22.287
Yo, Lou and thrash, what's up?

05:22.355 --> 05:23.655
Dude, thanks for hooking us up

05:23.723 --> 05:25.424
with those mudbucket tickets.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.559
Yeah, that concert rocked!

05:27.627 --> 05:30.195
Lou, don't forget the
lawn clippings, guys.

05:30.263 --> 05:33.532
Good morning,
Mr. Wheeler.
Your son rocks.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.201

05:50.316 --> 05:51.717
What's the word, Figg?

05:51.751 --> 05:53.831
Well, you've got
a pop quiz coming up
in fifth period.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.821
Also, they
mailed out third quarter
report cards yesterday,

05:55.888 --> 05:56.988
so head's up at home.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.357
Got it.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.725
And you still need a date
for the spring dance.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.593
I compiled a dossier
from the top contenders

06:01.661 --> 06:02.594
and scheduled interviews
for lunch period.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.097
What's up, man?
What's going on?

06:05.164 --> 06:07.366
Pretty simple day, you know?

06:07.433 --> 06:10.369
Figg: Ok, girls if
you'll please be seated.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.707
I'm captain of the cheer squad,

06:15.775 --> 06:18.243
a great dancer,
oh, and I look
spectacular

06:18.311 --> 06:21.246
in all spring colors.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.416
You have impressive
qualifications, Julie.

06:24.484 --> 06:25.917
But I do have
one question for you.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.819
Sure, anything!

06:27.887 --> 06:30.355
What is the name
of Gotham man's arch-enemy?

06:30.423 --> 06:32.023
I'm sorry?

06:32.091 --> 06:35.026
<i>Gotham man?</i>
Proton comics?

06:35.128 --> 06:38.797
Created by artist
Stewart bickford
in 1947...

06:38.831 --> 06:40.298
Right. Right. Right.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.634
The superhero.
But why are you...

06:42.668 --> 06:43.769
Look. Look. Look.

06:43.836 --> 06:47.172
Do you know the name
of his arch-enemy or not?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.307
Sure! It's...
I think...

06:49.375 --> 06:52.177
Charlie.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.815
Thanks, Julie.
We'll let you know. Next!

06:56.883 --> 06:59.484
Wait! Frank?

06:59.552 --> 07:02.754
Jim? Tim? Eugene?

07:02.822 --> 07:05.123
Can't this be
multiple choice
or something?

07:05.191 --> 07:06.324
Ok, next!

07:06.392 --> 07:08.293
Support the local
animal shelter.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.629
The shelter is in desperate need

07:10.696 --> 07:12.264
of renovations and volunteers.

07:12.331 --> 07:13.565
Please, take a flyer.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.200
Oh, Emily!
Sure, I'll take one.

07:16.636 --> 07:17.969
Ok, look.

07:18.037 --> 07:19.538
Figg, this is the list of comics

07:19.605 --> 07:21.273
I need you
to pick up for me. Ok?

07:21.340 --> 07:22.441
Figg: Ok.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.743
Thanks loads, Calvin.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.678
Oh, and that's a trick question.

07:26.746 --> 07:30.849
Gotham man's arch-enemy
has no name.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.987
Emily: Please save
the animal shelter!

07:37.924 --> 07:38.857
Hi, there.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.460
I'm sorry, Emily.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.462
You know how short
we are in funding.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.030
We just don't have the space.

07:45.097 --> 07:48.300
Please, Mr. Dudley,
just a little bit more time!

07:48.367 --> 07:50.535
I know that I can
find tycho a home!

07:50.603 --> 07:53.872
Hi, there, buddy.
Hey, tycho.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.008
Tycho? Emily,
we talked about
naming the animals.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.144
It just makes it harder when...

07:59.178 --> 08:01.246
Things don't work out.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.081
But I've been working with him,

08:03.149 --> 08:04.950
training him.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.853
He's really very sweet.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.857
And... I taught him a trick.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.992
Hey! Hey!

08:14.026 --> 08:18.230
Um, no, stop it.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.733
Um, that wasn't the trick.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.035
Emily, you're just
gonna have to learn

08:24.103 --> 08:27.405
we can't save 'em all.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.142
It's ok, tycho.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.479
We'll find you a home.
I promise.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.017
Calvin: You know,
it's my dream

08:39.085 --> 08:40.885
to get <i>Gotham man ♪1.</i>

08:40.953 --> 08:41.953
You have to admit,

08:41.988 --> 08:43.655
<i>the dark dragon chronicles</i>

08:43.722 --> 08:45.824
represents the
pinnacle of the
Gotham man legacy.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.193
But I mean,
the original Gotham man,

08:48.261 --> 08:49.361
he's, like...

08:49.428 --> 08:52.397
Hey, Calvin!
Pop-a-Wheeler!

08:52.465 --> 08:55.367
We need to talk, man.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.904
Hey, mama.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.039
Hey, sweetie.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.607
Don't mind if we use
this space a little bit,
do you?

09:02.675 --> 09:04.009
No, you go ahead, baby.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.945
Calvin, have a seat.

09:07.013 --> 09:10.348
Ok. Seat?
That ain't gonna hurt.

09:10.416 --> 09:11.416
Listen, man.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.419
Tonight is the last
game of the season.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.588
We win this game,
we clinch regionals.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.890
You guys are
6 1/2 point favorites.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.158
What's the problem?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.193
Westlake somehow
got a hold of
our playbook,

09:22.261 --> 09:26.164
and they're
gonna know all
of our schemes.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.137
You know what?

09:32.204 --> 09:35.507
I might be able to help.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.443
Hey, what's that gonna cost us?

09:40.012 --> 09:41.813
What makes you think
i wouldn't just do it

09:41.881 --> 09:43.682
in the name of
good sportsmanship?

09:43.716 --> 09:45.984
You know, school spirit?

09:46.052 --> 09:47.953
'Cause I know you, Calvin.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.654
Ok, good enough for me.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.356
Come on, Figg.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.792
Hook me up, man.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.665
What are you thinking?!

10:00.733 --> 10:02.233
The game starts
in a couple of hours!

10:02.268 --> 10:04.736
I'm thinking
<i>Gotham man number 43.</i>

10:04.804 --> 10:07.405
Trade.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.074
But how and who?

10:09.141 --> 10:12.510
You know, um, Simon gimple?

10:12.578 --> 10:14.746
Sure, he goes to westlake.

10:14.814 --> 10:19.884
Yeah, he's also
the basketball team
equipment manager.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.601
Hello?

10:36.702 --> 10:38.737
So, how's the pizza, Simon?

10:38.804 --> 10:40.071
Calvin?
Where are you?

10:40.139 --> 10:42.207
That's not important.

10:42.274 --> 10:43.942
Did you bring it?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.677
Um...

10:47.179 --> 10:50.582
Announcer: And now,
to amaze, excite,
and inspire,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.951
the bedford high
pre-game prep committee

10:53.019 --> 10:55.854
is proud to present
Preston price

10:55.921 --> 11:00.458
and his wonder dog Jacques!

11:00.526 --> 11:01.793
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:01.861 --> 11:05.296
it is our hope that
Jacques' riveting performance

11:05.364 --> 11:09.334
will inspire you all
to be champions.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.304
Ok. Ok.
Man: Do it!

11:19.912 --> 11:22.213
Could you guys
step away from
Jacques, please?

11:22.248 --> 11:25.250
Hop up!

11:25.284 --> 11:28.787
Ah, good boy.
Good boy.

11:28.854 --> 11:33.358
Oh, isn't that little dog cute?!

11:33.426 --> 11:35.760
Calvin, we need that book.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.729
I brought it, but, uh...

11:37.797 --> 11:40.265
Simon, come on, man,
we had a deal. Ok?

11:40.332 --> 11:43.168
Now slip it in
one of the newspapers

11:43.235 --> 11:46.871
in the rack,
by the door. Yeah.

11:52.812 --> 11:55.046
Look, Calvin,
you said you were gonna

11:55.114 --> 11:56.715
get me something cool for this.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.883
Something hi-tech.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.419
Man, you're holding it.

12:01.487 --> 12:05.056
That cell phone
is a ranyo sch-600, man.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.092
That cell phone doesn't even

12:07.126 --> 12:10.929
come out in the U.S.
until next year. Enjoy.

12:10.996 --> 12:13.198
I don't know, Calvin.

12:13.265 --> 12:17.402
I feel like
a traitor or something.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.805
Calvin? Hello?

12:20.873 --> 12:23.274
Are you there? Hello?

12:23.342 --> 12:26.344
Calvin, are
you there? Hello?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.613
Good boy. God boy.
Let's skateboard.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.915
Good boy.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.118
Thank you. Thank you.

12:34.286 --> 12:35.286
Thank you.

12:35.354 --> 12:38.656
Jacques and I thank you.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.792
If Jacques and I didn't
fire up this team,

12:40.860 --> 12:42.861
nothing will.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.839
Yo, Figg!

12:54.907 --> 12:56.908
Come here!

13:00.679 --> 13:02.614
Where's Calvin at, man?

13:02.681 --> 13:03.848
We're gonna get
crushed out there!

13:03.916 --> 13:05.150
It's all right, guys.
He'll be here.

13:05.217 --> 13:08.653
This is just like
issue 511 of <i> Gotham man.</i>

13:08.721 --> 13:09.721
All: What?!

13:09.755 --> 13:10.789
Where the nameless one
stole the blueprints

13:10.856 --> 13:13.024
from the Gotham cave.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.093
Figg, if we lose this game,

13:15.161 --> 13:16.427
we're gonna need someone

13:16.495 --> 13:18.997
to take our
frustrations out on,
are you feelin' me?

13:19.064 --> 13:21.366
All: Wildcats!

13:21.467 --> 13:24.569
Go, wildcats!

13:32.778 --> 13:33.878
Yo, Figg!

13:33.946 --> 13:35.213
Oh, Calvin.

13:40.286 --> 13:44.055
Yo, this should
even things up a little.

13:45.624 --> 13:47.225
Ha ha!
The westlake playbook!

13:47.293 --> 13:48.893
Yes!
Yeah!

13:48.961 --> 13:49.894
Calvin,
i cannot believe
you pulled this off.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.497
Rich, please, pay the man.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.033
Grr! Ha!

13:59.104 --> 14:01.673
<i>Gotham man.</i> Issue ♪2.

14:01.740 --> 14:02.740
All: Ooh.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.443
We are going to
win this thing, guys.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.477
This is promised land time,

14:06.545 --> 14:07.612
and I'm takin' us there, y'all!

14:07.680 --> 14:08.680
Come on! Let's do this!

14:08.747 --> 14:11.416
Let's go!

14:17.156 --> 14:20.792
Whoo! Yeah, baby!
Game time, baby! Yeah!

14:22.661 --> 14:24.662
You see what I mean?

14:24.730 --> 14:27.365
It's me and Jacques.

14:27.433 --> 14:31.870

is, like, totally contagious.

We would like to thank

15:18.651 --> 15:21.052
the entire student body
of bedford junior high

15:21.120 --> 15:23.254
who came out here
for this season

15:23.322 --> 15:24.322
to support us.

15:24.390 --> 15:25.957
Come on, y'all.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.427
But we could not have done this

15:29.495 --> 15:31.062
without the help of a very,

15:31.130 --> 15:32.664
very special fan.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.565
We are dedicating
this one to him.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.034
This is so embarrassing.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.302
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.003
It was nothing, really.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.038
It was the least i could do.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.974
Calvin Wheeler!
Give it up, y'all!

16:01.527 --> 16:03.461
Hey, mom. Hi, dad.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.366
What's the matter?

16:08.400 --> 16:10.401
Did somebody die?

16:10.436 --> 16:13.671
Mm-hmm.
Mr. grade point average.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.109
My grade
point average? Hmm?

16:19.278 --> 16:21.012
No way, that cannot be mine.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.181
I am passing every class.

16:23.248 --> 16:24.768
No, you are barely
passing every class.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.217
You're doing
just enough to get by.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.119
And not just at school.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.289
Take the garbage, for example.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.623
Wait. Wait. Wait.

16:32.691 --> 16:35.026
Did Lou and thrash
forget the lawn
trimmings?

16:35.094 --> 16:37.495
You know what?
I gotta talk
to them.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.063
You're missing
the point, Calvin.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.099
We asked you
to take the garbage out.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.001
All your teachers say
you're bright and popular,

16:43.068 --> 16:44.702
but that is not enough, Calvin!

16:44.770 --> 16:47.405
Look, we want you
to go to college,
have a real future,

16:47.473 --> 16:48.593
but that's never gonna happen

16:48.640 --> 16:51.743
if you keep taking
every shortcut you can.

17:03.956 --> 17:07.692
Issue ♪2 down, issue ♪1 to go.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.443
That was a good one.

17:25.511 --> 17:27.145
What's up, Figg?

17:29.181 --> 17:31.616
Figg? Figg, you ok?

17:33.485 --> 17:36.888
Nong's comics. Main
street go!

17:55.507 --> 17:56.841
That...

17:59.078 --> 18:00.912
That can't be
what I think it is.

18:00.979 --> 18:03.548
1947.
<i>Gotham man.</i>

18:03.615 --> 18:05.883
<i>Numero uno.</i>

18:05.951 --> 18:09.287
Edition one.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.255
But...

18:11.323 --> 18:13.858
There's only 8 known copies

18:13.892 --> 18:17.095
in existence.

18:17.162 --> 18:20.631
Look at the price, Calvin.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.968
$3,000?

18:27.072 --> 18:28.306
There's no way.

18:28.373 --> 18:32.977
Your current net worth
is $144.63.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.613
So, that means
I'll need to raise...

18:36.582 --> 18:39.984
Less 3,000.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.854
$2,855.37.

18:42.921 --> 18:45.857
Not including tax.
It's impossible.

18:45.924 --> 18:47.925
It's what?

18:47.993 --> 18:51.295
What do we say
about "the impossible?"

18:51.363 --> 18:53.664
Ok. Ok.

18:53.732 --> 18:58.536
Expect... The impossible!

19:01.106 --> 19:03.808
Figg! Get down!

19:09.481 --> 19:10.481
All right.

19:10.549 --> 19:11.916
Careful.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.418
Not there, you dufus.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.120
Jacques and i
need a full 100 feet

19:16.188 --> 19:17.989
for our training.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.325
Jacques!

19:21.393 --> 19:23.427
Aah!

19:24.730 --> 19:26.297
Get away from Jacques!

19:27.432 --> 19:29.033
Oh, Jacques, my precious.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.470
Did that bad, bad boy hurt you?

19:32.538 --> 19:35.373
Are you crazy?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.608
That little rat
of yours attacked me.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.144
This... Rat...

19:40.212 --> 19:43.581
Happens to be
Jean Jacques
St. germaine de dupree.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.384
He's an award-winning
pure-bred terrier.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.753
We've won royal hound dog food's

19:48.820 --> 19:51.489
top dog invitational
2 years in a row.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.491
Congratulations.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.393
If I ever decide
to give a flying whoop,

19:55.460 --> 19:57.428
I'll let you know.

19:57.496 --> 20:01.032
Yeah?
Well, whoop on this.

20:01.099 --> 20:02.767
First prize is $5,000.

20:05.003 --> 20:06.103
Could you repeat that?

20:06.171 --> 20:07.572
$5,000.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.974
We defend our title in 2 weeks

20:10.042 --> 20:12.610
at the bedford civic center.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.146
According to
the royal hound
top dog rule book,

20:15.214 --> 20:16.881
their invitational
finals is held
once a year.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.349
In order to qualify,

20:18.417 --> 20:19.450
you have to place first

20:19.518 --> 20:20.518
in at least one regular season

20:20.586 --> 20:22.286
top dog event.

20:22.354 --> 20:24.689
Win one event to qualify?
No problem.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.991
Woman: Shh.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.062
That gets you an
automatic invitation

20:31.096 --> 20:32.296
to the top dog finals.

20:32.364 --> 20:33.731
It's a freestyle event

20:33.799 --> 20:35.833
judged on a scale of one to 100.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.034
The owner of
the dog must perform

20:37.102 --> 20:38.402
a 90-second routine.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.037
You can do anything.

20:40.105 --> 20:41.539
Tricks, acrobatics,

20:41.607 --> 20:42.740
whatever will
impress the judges.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.576
Sounds like easy money.
Ha ha ha!

20:45.644 --> 20:47.245
Woman: Shh!

20:47.312 --> 20:50.681
Yeah, except
the top dog season
is almost over,

20:50.749 --> 20:52.216
and we happen to be missing

20:52.284 --> 20:53.784
something kind of important.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.654
Like what?

20:56.722 --> 20:59.624
Woman: Shh!

21:01.093 --> 21:04.028
A dog.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.164
This one's 850.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.767
850?

21:09.835 --> 21:11.269
Dollars?!

21:11.336 --> 21:13.838
Calvin, these are
real, pure-bred dogs.

21:13.905 --> 21:16.107
They cost real money.

21:16.174 --> 21:19.310
Yeah, yeah, we need one
we can get real cheap.

21:22.481 --> 21:24.115
What's this say?

21:24.182 --> 21:26.651
Central city animal shelter?

21:37.162 --> 21:38.796
Hello, there.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.031
Sugar woogar.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.066
How are you today?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.001
Hello. Hello,
little buddy.

21:51.710 --> 21:52.877
Calvin?

21:52.944 --> 21:55.546
Oh, hey, Emily.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.153
So, how does this work?

22:02.220 --> 22:05.222
How does what work, exactly?

22:05.290 --> 22:07.158
You know!

22:07.192 --> 22:09.593
Me, you know, getting a dog.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.331
You're not serious.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.232
You wouldn't even hold my puppy

22:15.300 --> 22:16.567
when I brought him in
for show and tell

22:16.635 --> 22:17.902
in the third grade.

22:17.969 --> 22:20.671
You remember that?

22:20.739 --> 22:22.173
You said that
animals were dirty.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.541
You remember <i> that?</i>

22:23.575 --> 22:25.843
Calvin, I have
known you for years!

22:25.877 --> 22:26.844
You never do anything

22:26.878 --> 22:28.879
unless there's
something in it for you.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.915
You know what?

22:30.982 --> 22:33.084
I thought maybe adopting a dog

22:33.151 --> 22:34.218
would be good for me,

22:34.252 --> 22:37.188
help me turn over a new leaf.

22:37.222 --> 22:40.124
Maybe I came to the wrong place.

22:42.127 --> 22:43.994
Calvin, wait.

22:44.062 --> 22:47.531
Um, there is one dog.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.234
What is that thing?

22:50.302 --> 22:51.936
I named him tycho.

22:56.074 --> 22:59.110
Aw, he likes you.

22:59.177 --> 23:01.145
Aw, good boy, tycho.

23:02.614 --> 23:03.614
Ok. Look. Ok.

23:03.682 --> 23:06.684
Are you absolutely, positively,

23:06.752 --> 23:09.887
100% sure this is
the only dog available?

23:11.990 --> 23:12.990
Aah!

23:13.058 --> 23:14.558
Tycho! No!

23:14.626 --> 23:17.228
Give me the shirt!
Give me!

23:17.295 --> 23:19.530
Tycho, will you
let go of his shirt?

23:19.598 --> 23:21.766
Please, tycho.
Give me the shirt.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.534
Ohh!

23:23.602 --> 23:25.636
He loves to
play tug-of-war.

23:25.670 --> 23:29.206
Take him or leave him.

23:32.644 --> 23:35.012
Oh, and do me a favor.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.783
Don't buy
any royal hound
brand dog food

23:38.850 --> 23:41.285
or any of their products.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.754
They sponsor these
horrible dog shows

23:43.822 --> 23:46.023
and I can't stand seeing
animals exploited.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.726
Oh, yeah, totally. Heh.
Me, neither.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.662
Ok, um...

23:51.696 --> 23:54.698
All you need is
a signature from
a parent or guardian.

23:54.766 --> 23:59.036
That's not going
to be a problem, is it?

23:59.070 --> 24:03.140
No, uh... Of course not.

24:09.848 --> 24:13.017
Promise you will
work harder next semester?

24:13.084 --> 24:14.852
I mean it this time,
Calvin. No shortcuts.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.855
I'll bring up my marks,
i promise, ok?

24:17.923 --> 24:20.758
Ok. Now don't forget.
Sign here...

24:22.394 --> 24:24.161
And right down there.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.229
Here?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.730
Ok.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.267
Thank you, mom.

24:34.372 --> 24:36.707
Ecch!

24:36.775 --> 24:39.677
Ok, ok.
Should I be worried?

24:39.744 --> 24:41.479
You know, you know, about germs?

24:41.546 --> 24:43.247
No, actually he should.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.549
A dog's mouth is cleaner
than a human's.

24:47.419 --> 24:50.721
I find that very hard
to believe.

24:51.556 --> 24:53.190
Tycho!

24:53.258 --> 24:54.892
Come here, boy.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.494
Come here. Tch tch!

24:56.561 --> 25:01.332
Ok, now this is my home number.

25:01.399 --> 25:02.533
Ok.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.935
Give me a call
if you have any problems.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.837
And I'll be coming by
your house in about 10 days.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.739
Really?

25:08.807 --> 25:11.342
Yeah. It's a standard
post-adoption interview.

25:11.409 --> 25:13.210
Just make sure that
you're fit as an owner.

25:13.278 --> 25:14.411
Cool.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.780
Come on, buddy.
Come on.

25:16.815 --> 25:19.650
Calvin, you are responsible
for this dog now.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.151
You do realize that?

25:21.219 --> 25:23.387
Hey, no problem.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.623
Ooh!

25:27.692 --> 25:29.226
Ok, let's go.

25:31.796 --> 25:34.732
All right. Giddy-up!

25:34.799 --> 25:36.867
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

25:36.935 --> 25:38.936
I'm not gonna pull you, ok?

25:39.004 --> 25:40.738
<i>You</i> are gonna pull me, ok?

25:40.839 --> 25:42.239
Ok. Let's go.

26:29.654 --> 26:31.655
Don't you move.

26:31.690 --> 26:33.791
Ok, hurry up.

26:33.858 --> 26:34.959
Whoa!

26:35.026 --> 26:37.227
♪ We have to show
that we can ♪

26:37.262 --> 26:40.297
♪ run and jump and hop
and keep a low sugar rush ♪

26:40.365 --> 26:41.999
Whoa!

26:42.067 --> 26:48.739
♪ Can we run and jump
and hop and keep
a low sugar rush? ♪

26:48.807 --> 26:49.807
♪ Keep it bold,

26:49.874 --> 26:51.842
Whoa! Oh... oh!

26:55.814 --> 26:57.948

27:00.218 --> 27:03.520
Ohh!

Oh ho!

27:05.557 --> 27:08.525
Yeah! Caught ya!
Ha ha ha ha!

27:08.593 --> 27:10.828
Me and you gotta have a talk.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.162
Whoa! No! Stop! Whoa!

27:12.230 --> 27:14.531
Look out!

27:14.599 --> 27:15.833
Do you hear me? Bad dog!

27:15.900 --> 27:20.604
No, no! Not the hill,
please! Not the hill!

27:20.672 --> 27:23.040
Tycho! Tycho!

27:25.143 --> 27:28.846
Stop! Stop, tycho!
Stop! I'm losin' my grip!

27:28.913 --> 27:32.049
Tycho!

27:32.117 --> 27:35.619
Oh, tycho! Aah!

27:35.687 --> 27:39.390
Aah! No!

27:39.457 --> 27:44.261
Aah!

27:55.874 --> 27:58.909
Oh, tycho!

28:00.145 --> 28:02.246
Come on, man.
It's just for
a couple of weeks.

28:02.313 --> 28:03.847
I don't know, Calvin.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.182
Look, man, you won't
even know he's there.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.251
Why can't he just stay with you?

28:07.318 --> 28:08.519
Are you crazy?

28:08.586 --> 28:10.754
My parents won't even
let me have a goldfish.

28:10.822 --> 28:14.725
Look, man, this is just like
issue 723 of <i> Gotham man,</i>

28:14.793 --> 28:16.960
when he had to tame
those wild stampeding
buffalo mutants?

28:16.995 --> 28:20.164
Yeah, but Gotham man has,
like, super powers.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.599
So do you.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.005
You just don't know it yet.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.275
Calvin. Calvin,
you can't be se...

28:45.356 --> 28:47.024
Hey, man, you ok?

28:47.092 --> 28:48.926
7 pounds.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.794
That's the weight limit
allowed for pets

28:50.895 --> 28:53.897
at my apartment complex.
7 pounds.

28:53.965 --> 28:56.133
Come on, Figg, man,
i was counting on you.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.635
Issue 723 of <i> Gotham man.</i>
Remember?

28:58.703 --> 29:01.572
Gotham man's landlord
never threatened
to evict him.

29:03.475 --> 29:07.511
Tycho's, like, 24 times
over the legal limit.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.047
Right. Let's just
get him in here.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.015
Shh! Shh! Shh!

29:12.050 --> 29:13.584
Go! Go.

29:13.651 --> 29:14.752
Gosh.

29:14.819 --> 29:18.288
Later, man.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.990
Later.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.160
Hey!

29:23.194 --> 29:24.128
Hey, hey, hey.

29:24.195 --> 29:26.497
Who do you think you are, buddy?

29:26.564 --> 29:28.398
You are a guest in my home.

29:29.467 --> 29:30.834
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh! Shh!

29:30.902 --> 29:31.835
Control yourself.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.437
Ok, look.
You sleep here. Ok?

29:34.639 --> 29:36.673
Hey! Hey.

29:36.741 --> 29:37.941
You... ok, come on.

29:38.009 --> 29:39.476
Get on.

29:41.079 --> 29:42.012
All right. Shh!

29:42.080 --> 29:43.080
Quiet. Ok?

29:44.182 --> 29:45.549
This is not acceptable.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.284
You just sleep...
You want me to show you?

29:47.352 --> 29:48.418
Go like this.

29:48.486 --> 29:50.687
Go just like this.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.462
Say, you're slick.
Yeah, all right!

29:58.530 --> 30:00.631
Finally!

30:00.698 --> 30:04.201
Ok? See? Sleep time.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.103
Good times, good times.

30:09.874 --> 30:13.076
Oh! Hey. Hey, hey.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.711
Hey.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.836
Huh?

30:38.903 --> 30:40.137
Heard you snoring last night.

30:40.205 --> 30:42.573
It sounded awful.
Are you getting a cold?

30:42.640 --> 30:46.543
Uh... Uh, yeah.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.812
I'm coming down
with something.
'Choo!

30:48.880 --> 30:49.980
Excuse me.

30:50.048 --> 30:51.915
And one more thing, Calvin.

30:51.983 --> 30:54.284
You're a growing boy.
You really need to
shower every day.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.191
Ok. There's only one
sanctioned event left

31:01.259 --> 31:03.560
in the top dog regular
season circuit.

31:03.595 --> 31:07.297
It's our last chance
to get an invitation
to the top dog finals.

31:07.365 --> 31:08.599
All we have to do is win it.

31:08.666 --> 31:09.800
"Owners must lead their dogs

31:09.868 --> 31:10.801
"through a series

31:10.869 --> 31:12.302
"of ramps, tunnels,
and water hazards.

31:12.370 --> 31:16.173
Time penalties will be
assessed for each missed
obstacle."

31:18.676 --> 31:20.010
What are you doing with that?

31:21.446 --> 31:25.048
Well, when you said
you were competing
in the dog show

31:25.116 --> 31:26.416
with Jean jacquesquise,

31:26.484 --> 31:29.386
ancient doo doo,
i decided to put
my dog in there.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.023
You may be a big deal at school,

31:33.091 --> 31:35.859
but dog shows are
out of your league.

31:35.927 --> 31:37.427
Do you understand?

31:37.495 --> 31:38.996
I will destroy you.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.698
Chill, Preston. Look, man,

31:41.766 --> 31:43.901
I'm not trying to step
on anybody's toes here.

31:43.968 --> 31:45.068
Ok?

31:45.136 --> 31:46.937
You listen to me very closely.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.239
Whatever scheme you're
planning with that
mangy mutt,

31:49.307 --> 31:52.209
you better just
drop it now. Ok?

31:52.277 --> 31:54.745
Consider yourself warned.

31:56.047 --> 31:57.781
Hey!

31:58.950 --> 32:00.450
Hey, hey, hey.

32:00.518 --> 32:02.119
Oh... unh!

32:03.922 --> 32:05.188
No, man!

32:05.256 --> 32:06.690
I got him!
Ohh...

32:06.758 --> 32:07.758
Unh!

32:09.294 --> 32:10.294
Jacques!
Tycho!

32:10.328 --> 32:11.461
Help me, Jacques, please!

32:11.529 --> 32:12.629
Tycho!

32:12.697 --> 32:13.764
Ohh...

32:15.166 --> 32:17.267
Tycho! Come back here!

32:17.335 --> 32:18.402
Tycho!
Ohh...

32:18.469 --> 32:21.538
Oof! Ohh...

32:21.606 --> 32:24.374
Oh, Jacques, I'm sorry.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.647
Stupid dog.

32:39.590 --> 32:42.059
You're such a mess.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.227
Ohh!
Ohh!

32:44.295 --> 32:46.563
Hey... hey, man!

32:46.631 --> 32:47.864
Stop!

32:47.932 --> 32:49.766
Don't... oh! Oh!

32:49.834 --> 32:52.102
H-how's that,
huh, Calvin?

32:52.170 --> 32:54.304
Oh! Oh...

32:54.372 --> 32:56.173
All right,
I'm gettin' you. Ok.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.941
Calvin, come on.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.109
Get him, tycho.

32:59.177 --> 33:00.844
Oh, tycho, stop!

33:02.213 --> 33:04.414
Figg: Calvin!

33:06.217 --> 33:08.485
Aah... uhh! Oh...

33:08.553 --> 33:10.253
Dude, your mom's home!

33:10.321 --> 33:12.856
Oh... oh... uh...

33:20.365 --> 33:21.365
Oh, hey, kids.

33:21.432 --> 33:22.466
What you doin'?

33:22.533 --> 33:25.068
We're just,
um... Heh...

33:25.136 --> 33:26.203
Chillin'.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.205
Chillin' like a villain,
Mrs. Wheeler.

33:28.272 --> 33:29.606
Yeah, chillin'.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.376
Calvin: Heh. Yeah.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.544

Come here, tycho.

35:15.980 --> 35:19.249
Sorry mother molasses!

35:19.317 --> 35:21.051
Ty-tycho?

35:23.054 --> 35:24.488
Tycho?

35:27.358 --> 35:28.225
Tycho.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.228
Ty-tycho! Don't you run.

35:42.106 --> 35:44.307
You have got to be kiddin' me!

35:44.375 --> 35:46.476
Man, I gotta get you
out of sight.

35:46.544 --> 35:48.278
No way.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.313
Ok.

35:50.381 --> 35:51.615
Come on. Ok. Ok.

35:51.682 --> 35:52.849
Come on. Stay. Stay.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.784
Just stay, ok? Stay. Stay.

35:54.852 --> 35:56.153
Stay. Stay.

36:01.025 --> 36:03.326
Calvin?

36:03.394 --> 36:05.929
Oh! Hey, guys!

36:05.997 --> 36:08.398
I was just, uh, um...

36:08.466 --> 36:09.799
Fixing a snack.

36:09.834 --> 36:10.734
What on earth happened?

36:10.801 --> 36:12.035
And stop fidgeting.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.804
I know you're up to something.

36:14.872 --> 36:16.206
Are you ok, son?

36:16.274 --> 36:18.008
Wait! Wait!

36:18.075 --> 36:19.943
This is...
This is all my fault.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.378
This is all my fault.

36:21.445 --> 36:23.046
We can <i> stay</i> here!

36:23.114 --> 36:24.681
We can <i> stay</i> here.

36:24.749 --> 36:26.683
We can still stay here, yeah.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.151
Dad, dad, look.

36:28.219 --> 36:29.419
See, um, I just...

36:29.487 --> 36:31.087
Just had a couple
of friends over,
that's all.

36:31.155 --> 36:33.823
That's all?!
Calvin, look at this mess.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.059
It looks like foreign agents
ransacked our kitchen

36:36.127 --> 36:37.807
and didn't find what
they were looking for.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.296
This ain't gonna work.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.664
Look, look.

36:40.731 --> 36:42.799
Look, look, um...

36:42.867 --> 36:44.067
Look, I can explain...

36:44.135 --> 36:45.535
All right, let's hear it.

36:45.603 --> 36:46.770
Mm-hmm. Ok.

36:46.837 --> 36:48.538
This is all my fault.
This is all my...

36:48.606 --> 36:49.773
I'll clean it up...

36:49.840 --> 36:50.774
Hold on, young man...

36:50.841 --> 36:52.075
Ok, dad, I'll do it,
I'll clean it up.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.311
Think about it.
He's hiding something.

36:54.345 --> 36:56.379
He didn't try to make
any excuses

36:56.447 --> 36:58.248
and he didn't
blame anybody else.

36:58.316 --> 36:59.816
This is the first time

36:59.884 --> 37:03.653
I've ever heard Calvin
take responsibility for...

37:03.721 --> 37:05.121
Anything.

37:07.825 --> 37:11.127
I'm surprised he even knows
where we keep the mop.

37:11.195 --> 37:13.263
We'll leave him.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.839
Oh... oh...

37:22.907 --> 37:24.407
Come on, tycho, come on.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.743
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:26.811 --> 37:27.911
Quiet.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.112
All right.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.747
Let's go, let's go.

37:42.326 --> 37:43.326
Tycho?

37:43.361 --> 37:45.262
Ty-Ty-tycho?

37:45.329 --> 37:47.597
Tycho, man...

37:47.665 --> 37:49.766
These are my sneakers!

37:51.002 --> 37:52.202
No. No.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.271
No, no, no.

37:54.338 --> 37:56.973
And this is my geometry
homework!

37:57.041 --> 37:58.308
Now, do you have any idea

37:58.376 --> 37:59.909
how long it took me to do that?

37:59.944 --> 38:02.212
Now, you tell me,
what am I supposed
to tell my teacher...

38:02.280 --> 38:04.214
My dog ate my homework?

38:04.282 --> 38:07.117
Calvin! Who are you
yelling at?

38:07.184 --> 38:08.285
Uh...

38:08.352 --> 38:09.719
Is everything
all right in there?

38:09.787 --> 38:10.720
Yeah, mom!

38:10.788 --> 38:12.055
I was just, uh...

38:12.123 --> 38:14.324
Doing my nightly meditations.

38:14.392 --> 38:17.627
Ohm... Ohm...

38:18.863 --> 38:21.064
Ohm... Ohm...

38:26.203 --> 38:29.506
Breakin' the house,
chewin' up my sneakers,

38:29.573 --> 38:31.274
eating my homework.
I don't care
about this dog,

38:31.342 --> 38:33.910
so even if it is another week...

38:33.978 --> 38:35.578
We are over.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.080
You hear me?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.815
We are over.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.591
Right after school

38:48.659 --> 38:50.427
tycho is going right back
to the pound.

38:50.494 --> 38:51.528
But what about the show?

38:51.595 --> 38:53.563
It is not worth it.

38:53.631 --> 38:54.864
Calvin, he's your
responsibility.

38:54.899 --> 38:55.932
Not anymore.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.100
Hey, Calvin.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.035
How ya doin', buddy?

38:59.103 --> 39:01.271
What's up, Leonard?
What's up, thrash?

39:01.339 --> 39:04.074
You know, I didn't realize
it was garbage day.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.042
Look, this is kind of
awkward for us.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.610
How do I put this?

39:07.678 --> 39:10.413
Well, it's like this...

39:10.448 --> 39:11.815
We gotta pound on you.

39:13.617 --> 39:15.185
Figg, man, get outta here.

39:15.252 --> 39:16.252
No way!

39:22.693 --> 39:24.561
It's nothing personal, Calvin.

39:24.628 --> 39:26.563
Yeah, we like ya.
Everyone does.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.365
But we're gettin' paid.

39:28.432 --> 39:29.566
It's business.

39:29.633 --> 39:30.900
You can appreciate that.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.503
I mean... can i
at least ask why?

39:33.571 --> 39:35.572
It's, uh, Preston price.

39:35.639 --> 39:37.073
He wants you and your dog

39:37.141 --> 39:39.376
to stay away from that dog show.

39:39.443 --> 39:40.944
And we're supposed to, you know,

39:40.978 --> 39:42.278
encourage you to drop out.

39:42.313 --> 39:43.480
And you know how...

39:43.547 --> 39:45.882
Persuasive we can be.

39:47.251 --> 39:49.486
Look, man,
none of this is necessary.

39:49.553 --> 39:50.920
Tell Preston i am taking tycho

39:50.988 --> 39:52.889
right back to the pound
today after school.

39:52.957 --> 39:55.658
Look, we still gotta
pound on you.
We've already been paid.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.794
Yeah. We got ethics
and stuff.

39:57.828 --> 39:58.828
Sorry, Calvin.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.764
There's no talking your way
out of this one.

40:00.831 --> 40:04.768
So you want it
in the face
or the gut or what?

40:10.508 --> 40:13.143
Surprise me.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.579
What is that?!
Ohh, no!

40:16.647 --> 40:17.714
Aah!

40:21.352 --> 40:23.286
Oh! Man! Are y'all ok?

40:29.160 --> 40:31.594
Calvin: You stupid dog!

40:31.662 --> 40:32.796
Come on, buddy! Come on!

40:32.863 --> 40:34.097
Ha ha ha!

40:34.165 --> 40:35.765
Heel!

40:35.833 --> 40:37.934
Ohh...

40:40.938 --> 40:42.939
I've been meaning
to fix that gate
for months.

40:42.973 --> 40:45.475
So let's recap.

40:45.543 --> 40:47.177
Our son is just spontaneously

40:47.211 --> 40:48.978
doing work around the house

40:49.046 --> 40:51.548
without even being told?

40:51.582 --> 40:53.750
I don't think it's our son.

40:53.818 --> 40:54.751
Calvin: Hello?

40:54.819 --> 40:55.752
Yeah, Emily?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.620
Yeah, it's Calvin.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.856
Yeah, uh, sorry to call so late,

40:59.924 --> 41:01.257
it's just that, uh...

41:01.325 --> 41:04.561
I could really use
some help with tycho.

41:04.628 --> 41:07.030
Well, nothing's really wrong.

41:07.097 --> 41:08.832
It's just that...

41:08.899 --> 41:11.668
He's a little bit more
than I bargained for.

41:11.735 --> 41:13.870
Ok, ok, sit.

41:14.705 --> 41:16.940
Bad dog. Bad...

41:17.007 --> 41:19.275
I said sit!
Do you know what sit means?

41:19.343 --> 41:21.444
You can't just yell at him!

41:21.512 --> 41:24.180
He's doin' it wrong.

41:24.248 --> 41:26.649
Well, why don't you try
teaching him the difference?

41:26.717 --> 41:29.886
Reward him when
he does something right.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.855
Come here.

41:32.723 --> 41:34.457
Come here, tycho.
Come here.

41:34.525 --> 41:36.125
Oh, good boy!

41:36.193 --> 41:37.460
Yeah, ok.

41:37.528 --> 41:38.962
Now sit.

41:39.029 --> 41:39.963
Sit.

41:40.030 --> 41:42.065
Yeah! Good boy!

41:42.132 --> 41:43.500
That's a good boy.

41:43.567 --> 41:44.434
Yeah.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.668
So that's it?

41:45.736 --> 41:47.804
Just give him food?

41:47.872 --> 41:50.874
A dog needs more than just food.

41:50.941 --> 41:52.642
You have to give him
encouragement,

41:52.710 --> 41:54.711
Patience, approval.

41:54.778 --> 41:58.014
And if you really want
a dog to respond to you,

41:58.048 --> 41:59.449
you have to give him love.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.018
Yeah, who's a good boy?!

Right. Right.

42:51.702 --> 42:54.304
Emily, can I ask you a question?

42:54.371 --> 42:55.972
Fire away.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.908
How did you know
Gotham man's archenemy
was nameless?

42:58.976 --> 43:00.743
Duh. I read the comics.

43:00.811 --> 43:02.679
<i>You</i> read them?

43:02.746 --> 43:06.082
Or do you just skim
through them sometimes maybe?

43:06.116 --> 43:07.750
Test me.

43:07.818 --> 43:09.586
Ok, uh...

43:09.653 --> 43:11.921
The license plate number
of the Gotham-mobile.

43:11.989 --> 43:15.258
Before or after
it got totaled
in issue 533?

43:15.326 --> 43:17.260
What is with
the trick questions?

43:17.328 --> 43:20.330
Have you ever
just been straight up
and real with a person?

43:21.999 --> 43:24.133
No.

43:24.969 --> 43:27.103
Never.

43:28.205 --> 43:29.272
Par for the course.

43:29.340 --> 43:30.607
Calvin:
Figg, I am telling you,

43:30.674 --> 43:33.276
Emily was just amazing
with tycho today.

43:33.344 --> 43:34.711
Do you know what?

43:34.778 --> 43:35.945
I think we have a good chance

43:36.013 --> 43:38.348
of winning that obstacle
course event.

43:40.484 --> 43:42.318
Mom's home early.

43:48.692 --> 43:50.927
Calvin, Figg, stay outside!

43:50.961 --> 43:52.829
There's a bear in the house.

43:52.896 --> 43:54.731
It's all right.
I've barricaded it
in your room

43:54.798 --> 43:55.999
and I'm calling 911.

43:56.066 --> 43:57.467
Mom, mom, mom,
chill, chill, ch...

43:57.534 --> 43:58.368
Shh!

43:58.435 --> 44:00.003
That's not a bear.

44:00.070 --> 44:01.404
That's tycho.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.906
My dog.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.575
Your what?

44:08.679 --> 44:10.079
Mom: It has to go back
to the pound.

44:10.447 --> 44:11.948
Dad: Now, hold on.

44:12.016 --> 44:13.583
I had a dog when I was a kid.

44:13.617 --> 44:15.451
Skinny little thing.
Followed me home one day.

44:15.519 --> 44:17.520
My mom and dad let me keep it.

44:17.588 --> 44:20.390
Well, honey,
it's very sweet,
but I just...

44:20.457 --> 44:23.292
You know... The funny thing
about having a dog...

44:23.360 --> 44:24.894
They're a real pain.

44:24.962 --> 44:26.562
Destroy everything in sight,

44:26.630 --> 44:28.831
pee on the rug,
slobber everywhere.

44:28.899 --> 44:30.333
But you love 'em anyway.

44:30.401 --> 44:33.636
So you're saying
this would be good
for Calvin.

44:34.905 --> 44:36.739
I'm saying that...

44:36.807 --> 44:39.375
Love doesn't have any shortcuts.

44:55.492 --> 44:57.627
Ok...

44:58.929 --> 45:00.196
Tycho...

45:00.264 --> 45:01.497
Can stay.

45:01.565 --> 45:03.399
Really?

45:03.467 --> 45:05.702
Yay! Thank you, mom!
Thank you.

45:05.769 --> 45:07.470
Thank you, dad.
Thank you.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.905
Not so fast.

45:08.972 --> 45:10.873
There's still
the little matter of you

45:10.941 --> 45:13.976
tricking your mom into
signing the adoption papers.

45:14.044 --> 45:16.879
Oh, yeah. Ha ha!

45:16.947 --> 45:19.348
Guess I forgot about that.
Just slipped my mind,
you know?

45:19.416 --> 45:20.717
Mom: No TV,

45:20.784 --> 45:22.351
no cell phone.

45:22.419 --> 45:23.453
Dad: For 2 months.

45:23.487 --> 45:24.954
And your grades better start...

45:24.988 --> 45:26.055
Getting better.

46:58.949 --> 47:01.384
It's just a bad dream.

47:02.853 --> 47:04.821
You're safe with me.

47:15.632 --> 47:18.134
To bedford civic auditorium,

47:18.202 --> 47:20.136
the site of the last
regular season event

47:20.204 --> 47:23.940
in royal hound dog food's
top dog show circuit.

47:24.007 --> 47:25.575
Today we'll be seeing
the obedience

47:25.642 --> 47:26.976
and obstacle dog trial.

47:27.044 --> 47:29.145
Well, this has got to be
the most athletic

47:29.213 --> 47:32.248
of all top dog
canine competitions.

47:32.316 --> 47:35.084
That's right, Chuck.
Owners have to lead
their dogs

47:35.152 --> 47:36.752
through a series
of obstacles
in a test of speed

47:36.820 --> 47:37.920
and agility.

47:37.988 --> 47:39.755
And, Holly, the winners
of this competition

47:39.823 --> 47:43.492
will go on
to the top dog finals
one week from today.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.461
The excitement has already begun

47:45.529 --> 47:47.289
here on the red carpet,
where we've seen dogs

47:47.331 --> 47:50.366
of all shapes, sizes,
and colors arriving.

47:50.434 --> 47:52.969
Holly, I'm being told right now

47:53.003 --> 47:56.405
that two-time top dog
defending champions
are pulling up.

47:56.473 --> 47:59.108
That's right, Chuck!
It's Preston price

47:59.176 --> 48:02.845
and his champion purebred
Jean Jacques St. germaine
de dupree.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.046
Preston. Preston.

48:04.114 --> 48:05.615
You and Jacques have already

48:05.682 --> 48:07.750
locked up an invitation
to next week's final.

48:07.818 --> 48:09.886
What are you doing here today?

48:09.953 --> 48:11.888
Narrowing down
the competition, Chuck.

48:11.955 --> 48:13.222
All right, I gotta go.

48:13.290 --> 48:15.758
What a well-groomed
boy.

48:20.163 --> 48:21.397
Yeah?

48:21.465 --> 48:23.032
Oh, right.

48:24.268 --> 48:26.135
Preston and Jacques

48:26.203 --> 48:29.205
just made quite an entrance.

48:30.040 --> 48:31.240
You know what?

48:31.308 --> 48:34.210
If they can arrive in style...

48:35.646 --> 48:37.280
So can we.

Did you see the size
of that one, Holly?

48:59.002 --> 49:01.304
I'm not even sure
that <i> was</i> a dog, Chuck.

50:21.718 --> 50:23.185
That's what I always say.

50:23.253 --> 50:24.253
Uh, excuse me.

50:24.321 --> 50:25.588
I'd hate to intrude,

50:25.655 --> 50:28.657
but section one
of the royal hound
top dog rulebook

50:28.725 --> 50:31.494
clearly states
that all dogs competing

50:31.561 --> 50:33.562
in any sanctioned
competition must meet

50:33.630 --> 50:35.431
at minimum general
presentation requirement

50:35.499 --> 50:37.233
that are up to
top dog standards.

50:37.267 --> 50:40.136
Clean fur, clipped nails.

50:40.203 --> 50:41.604
He's right.

50:41.671 --> 50:43.973
You'll need to get
a judge to sign off on this

50:44.041 --> 50:46.075
before you and your...

50:46.109 --> 50:47.343
Animal can compete.

50:47.411 --> 50:49.178
You have stall 14.

50:51.415 --> 50:53.182
Good luck.
You'll need it.

50:53.250 --> 50:55.351
Ohh...

50:55.385 --> 50:56.619
Calvin: Be afraid.

50:56.653 --> 50:58.587
Be very afraid.

50:58.655 --> 51:00.556
♪ There's a dog
comin' down the street ♪

51:00.624 --> 51:03.125
♪ gotta stop

51:03.193 --> 51:05.861

51:13.270 --> 51:15.204
Figg, look at this place, man.

51:15.272 --> 51:17.940
It's like we warped
into some freaky

51:18.008 --> 51:20.709
alternate dog universe,
you know?

51:20.777 --> 51:22.445
Calvin, these dogs
have entire teams

51:22.512 --> 51:23.979
of professional groomers.

51:24.047 --> 51:26.615
So? What do we have?

51:27.684 --> 51:29.385
One comb.

51:29.453 --> 51:30.853
The event begins in one hour.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.855
We're never gonna have
tycho ready in time.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.623
It's impossible.

51:37.194 --> 51:38.794
How many times have we
been over this, Figg?

51:38.862 --> 51:42.031
Man, you have really
got to learn to expect
the impossible.

51:43.533 --> 51:44.967
Rondel?

51:45.035 --> 51:47.069
Yeah, what's up, man?
It's Calvin.

51:47.137 --> 51:49.271
All right.
It's psyched, y'all.

51:49.339 --> 51:50.806
It's game time!

51:50.874 --> 51:53.476
Rondel, baby,
what kind of client
did you say this was?

51:53.543 --> 51:56.579
Stall 14? Thank you.

51:57.547 --> 51:58.848
Man, I owe you.

51:58.915 --> 52:00.483
Don't worry about it, kid.

52:00.550 --> 52:02.751
You know me.
I live to compete.

52:02.819 --> 52:04.787
Let's go.
Mom, the team is all yours.

52:04.821 --> 52:06.622
Hmm. Now, this is what
i call a challenge.

52:06.656 --> 52:10.392
All right, front court,
you're on nail clipping
duty, so move.

52:10.427 --> 52:12.261
Guards, I want to see
them teeth white
and shiny. Come on, now.

52:12.329 --> 52:14.396
Come on, y'all.
Y'all gotta be
feelin' me right now.

52:14.464 --> 52:15.931
Let's make this happen,
y'all. Come on.

52:15.999 --> 52:17.766
Yo, man, pass me those clippers.

52:22.072 --> 52:24.006
Hey, hey, hey.
Look me in my eyes.

52:24.074 --> 52:25.941
You are too fast.

52:26.009 --> 52:27.209
You are fast
like a freight train.

52:27.277 --> 52:28.911
You cannot be stopped.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.747
It's not in the body,
it's in the mind.

52:31.815 --> 52:35.618
You are the Mac daddy dog!
You feelin' me?!

52:35.685 --> 52:36.852
Chuck: In Lane one,

52:36.920 --> 52:39.688
we have two-time
top dog defending champions

52:39.756 --> 52:42.291
Preston price and Jacques.

52:44.394 --> 52:46.195
Holly: And in Lane 2,

52:46.263 --> 52:48.597
we have Calvin Wheeler
and his dog tycho.

52:48.632 --> 52:49.732
Yeah!

52:55.672 --> 52:56.672
Holly: Look at that.

52:57.774 --> 52:59.308
Chuck: I don't believe it,
Holly.

52:59.376 --> 53:01.977
This is Calvin and tycho's
first competition,

53:02.045 --> 53:04.747
but clearly they have
unleashed a team of stylists

53:04.814 --> 53:06.148
that know what they're doing.

53:06.216 --> 53:07.650
See, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

53:07.717 --> 53:10.319
Borden hair salon.
Fifth and main.

53:10.387 --> 53:11.587
Honey. Honey?

53:11.655 --> 53:14.657
You need to come see me.
Ok?

53:16.893 --> 53:18.894
Holly: This is
an event that favors

53:18.962 --> 53:21.497
smaller, more agile
animals, Chuck.

53:21.565 --> 53:24.200
Unless tycho is a lot more
fleet of foot than he looks,

53:24.267 --> 53:26.936
this won't even be close.

53:27.003 --> 53:29.205
Jacques and I are gonna
teach you and your mutt
a lesson.

53:29.272 --> 53:31.040
Well, uh...

53:31.107 --> 53:33.108
I'll just see you
at the finish line,
Preston.

53:33.176 --> 53:34.176
Official: Dogs ready.

53:37.514 --> 53:38.981
Handlers ready.

53:39.983 --> 53:43.152
On my mark...

53:44.254 --> 53:45.754
Get set...

53:45.822 --> 53:46.689
Go.

53:46.756 --> 53:48.657
Jacques, let's go, Jacques.

53:48.692 --> 53:50.326
Ok. Ok, weave, Jacques.
Weave, Jacques.

53:50.393 --> 53:52.628
Let's go.
Weave, Jacques. Good boy.

53:52.696 --> 53:54.897
Weave. Weave, Jacques.
Weave.

53:54.965 --> 53:56.232
Ok, come on, tycho.

53:56.299 --> 53:57.166
We can beat them.

53:57.234 --> 53:58.534
Let's go.

54:00.637 --> 54:02.605
Chuck: By golly, Holly,

54:02.672 --> 54:03.906
did you see that?

54:03.974 --> 54:05.274
Tycho is crashing
through the obstacles

54:05.342 --> 54:07.610
like they aren't even there.

54:07.677 --> 54:10.546
Calvin: Ok, that's cool.
We can still do it.

54:11.848 --> 54:14.250
Go through. Come on.
Go through.

54:14.317 --> 54:15.985
Crowd: Ohh!

54:17.053 --> 54:18.420
We can do it.
Come on.

54:18.488 --> 54:20.723
Go, go.
Go, go, go. Ohh!

54:20.790 --> 54:24.026
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!

54:24.094 --> 54:25.527
Holly: They're tunneling
through right now.

54:25.562 --> 54:27.763
That little dog
is still in the lead.

54:27.831 --> 54:29.398
He is so cute.

54:29.466 --> 54:31.800
Ohh! Whoa! Oh!

54:33.270 --> 54:34.837
Aah, aah, aah.
That's my shoulder!

54:39.175 --> 54:41.110
Holly: Splish splash,
he's takin' a bath.

54:41.177 --> 54:42.611
Chuck: That dog
is doing swimmingly.

54:42.679 --> 54:44.446
Think that's the doggie
paddle, Chuck.

54:44.514 --> 54:46.081
Tycho! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:46.149 --> 54:48.017
Unh! Aah!

54:48.084 --> 54:50.686
Tycho! Noooo!

54:53.623 --> 54:56.692
Ohh! He's gonna
have to shake
that one off.

54:56.760 --> 54:57.993
Jacques!

54:58.061 --> 54:59.128
Go, tycho... ow!

54:59.195 --> 55:00.129
Ohh!

55:00.196 --> 55:02.498
Oh, Jacques,
are you ok, Jacques?

55:02.565 --> 55:03.832
Come here, Jacques.

55:03.867 --> 55:05.067
Calvin: Come on!

55:05.135 --> 55:07.336
Where's my dog?!

55:07.404 --> 55:09.672
Oh, Jacques,
are you ok, Jacques?
I love you so much.

55:09.739 --> 55:11.273
Are you ok?

55:11.341 --> 55:13.342
Ohh!
Ok...

55:13.410 --> 55:15.577
Chuck: That dog is flying
off the bridge.

55:15.612 --> 55:17.112
Tycho takes the lead.

55:19.082 --> 55:20.282
Oh!

55:20.350 --> 55:22.351
Come on, man!
Come on, baby!

55:22.419 --> 55:26.422
Tycho, wait!
Tycho, no! No!

55:29.659 --> 55:30.659
Go, Jacques.

55:30.694 --> 55:32.227
Jacques, go, Jacques.

55:42.072 --> 55:43.505
Come. Hey, Jacques.

55:45.675 --> 55:47.109
This is
an award-winning dog.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.177
Get off of my dog!

55:48.211 --> 55:50.479
They're diggin' up
some trouble now, Chuck.

55:50.547 --> 55:53.716
Chuck:
It's pan-dog-monium.

55:53.783 --> 55:55.384
This is doggone exciting.

55:55.452 --> 55:58.554
Chuck: A canine catastrophe.

55:58.621 --> 56:01.457
Judges, we have
a violation. Code red!

56:01.491 --> 56:03.425
There's a race goin' on!

56:03.493 --> 56:05.227
Tycho, wait!

56:05.295 --> 56:07.396
Wait for me, tycho!

56:07.464 --> 56:09.064
Wait! I'm comin'!

56:11.901 --> 56:13.702
Tycho, come on, now,
go into the tunnel.

56:13.770 --> 56:15.337
Jacques!

56:15.405 --> 56:17.272
All right, tycho, we gonna win!

56:17.307 --> 56:19.007
Jacques... Jacques...

56:19.075 --> 56:21.443
No, get outta there!
Don't spin!

56:21.478 --> 56:24.880
Jacques! Jacques,
come out of there
this instant!

56:24.948 --> 56:26.448
Heel! Heel!

56:26.516 --> 56:28.751
Do something with
that mangy mutt!

56:32.255 --> 56:34.556
I think he's making
his way to the finish line.

56:34.624 --> 56:38.127
Draggin' that thing
like a dragon, isn't he?

56:40.663 --> 56:41.597
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!

56:41.664 --> 56:43.298
Oh ho ho!

56:43.366 --> 56:44.633
Holly:
That can't be good.

56:44.667 --> 56:46.301
Preston: Judges,
this is an outrage!

56:46.336 --> 56:48.537
Jacques and I are filing
an official protest!

56:48.605 --> 56:50.773
Jacques!

56:50.840 --> 56:53.409
Chuck: Holly, it looks like
Preston price has lost control
of his animal.

56:53.510 --> 56:56.879
I've never seen a champion
this flustered, Chuck.

56:56.946 --> 56:58.380
Preston: Bad dog!

56:58.448 --> 56:59.615
He's got to get
to the finish line.

56:59.682 --> 57:00.716
He's almost there!

57:00.784 --> 57:01.984
Oh, yeah!

57:06.656 --> 57:07.756
Come on, tycho.
Come on!

57:07.824 --> 57:10.726
Don't stop movin',
tycho, keep movin'!

57:12.162 --> 57:14.897
Please move.
Just please move.
I'm trying to win the race.

57:14.964 --> 57:16.765
Chuck: Preston price
has just been hit

57:16.800 --> 57:19.301
with a penalty
for carrying his dog.

57:19.369 --> 57:21.737
Holly: Oh, that is
going to cost the champ.

57:21.805 --> 57:23.639
Come on! Come on!

57:26.376 --> 57:28.076
Whoa!

57:28.144 --> 57:29.912
Whoo-hoo!

57:38.221 --> 57:41.356
♪ Victory is ours,
victory is ours ♪

57:41.424 --> 57:44.526
Holly: Ok, Chuck,
it's going to take
the judges some time

57:44.594 --> 57:45.928
to tally up all those
penalties here.

57:45.995 --> 57:48.630
Looks like we're finally
going to get a ruling

57:48.665 --> 57:50.065
from the head judge.

57:51.334 --> 57:52.935
The dog in Lane 2,

57:53.036 --> 57:54.169
tycho,

57:54.237 --> 57:57.840
completed the course
in one minute, 37 seconds.

57:57.874 --> 58:00.542
After calculating
the time penalties

58:00.610 --> 58:04.112
assessed for missing
every single obstacle,

58:04.180 --> 58:06.114
the final time

58:06.182 --> 58:08.851
is 2 minutes and 6 seconds.

58:08.918 --> 58:10.652
Unbelievable!

58:10.720 --> 58:13.055
Calvin Wheeler and his dog tycho

58:13.122 --> 58:15.123
have just set
a new course record.

58:15.191 --> 58:18.760
Holly: With some very
unorthodox strategy,
i might add.

58:18.828 --> 58:21.563
Just listen. The crowd
is begging for more.

58:23.132 --> 58:24.766
It's not fair.
He cheated.

58:24.834 --> 58:27.402
He can't just smash through
obstacles like that. Come on.

58:27.470 --> 58:30.973
The winner is
Calvin Wheeler and tycho.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.141
Ohh! Ohh!

58:34.244 --> 58:35.811
Yeah! Ha ha!

58:37.046 --> 58:38.246
Chuck: That first-place finish

58:38.281 --> 58:40.782
is going to secure
this unknown dog

58:40.817 --> 58:43.886
an invitation to
the top dog finals
next weekend.

58:43.953 --> 58:46.555
Holly: Calvin Wheeler
and his dog tycho

58:46.623 --> 58:48.223
have just shocked
the dog show world.

58:48.258 --> 58:49.358
I'm Chuck.

58:49.425 --> 58:50.592
And I'm Holly.

58:50.660 --> 58:52.294
Both: Bow-wow for now.

58:52.362 --> 58:53.962
Tell us how you feel!

58:54.030 --> 58:55.030
What are your plans?

58:55.064 --> 58:58.033
Ok, ok. Please,
one at a time.

58:58.101 --> 58:59.735
You.

58:59.802 --> 59:01.537
Charles networth,
<i>perfect poochie monthly.</i>

59:01.604 --> 59:03.872
Some members of the canine
press corps have already

59:03.940 --> 59:06.208
called your dog
tycho the terrible.

59:07.443 --> 59:08.477
What do you think
of the nickname?

59:08.545 --> 59:10.812
Well, uh... ha ha...
If the shoe fits...

59:10.880 --> 59:12.814
Get it, the shoe?

59:14.517 --> 59:16.018
Mandy call, <i>fancy canine.</i>

59:16.052 --> 59:18.287
Calvin, you and tycho
have now qualified to enter

59:18.354 --> 59:19.855
the top dog finals.

59:19.923 --> 59:22.190
Two-time defending champ
Preston price says that

59:22.258 --> 59:24.893
he will be impossible to beat.

59:24.961 --> 59:26.428
Any response?

59:33.603 --> 59:34.736
Um...

59:34.804 --> 59:36.972
Expect the impossible.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.007
That's great.

59:47.517 --> 59:49.985
Help me out, Figg.

59:57.327 --> 59:58.460
Thanks.

59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.395
No problem.

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:03.465
Can I ask you a question?

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.500
Ok.

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.002
What's the deal
with you and Calvin?

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.806
I mean, you follow him
around like you're
a servant.

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:14.610
When I first moved here,

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:17.846
kids made fun of me, you know,
'cause I have asthma.

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.281
And Calvin didn't?

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:20.782
No, he did.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:23.952
He was the worst actually.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.120
But why...

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:26.655
Do you remember in second grade,

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.457
when I had that really bad
asthma attack during recess?

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.658
Oh, yeah!

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:31.693
They called the ambulance
and everything.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.629
Yeah. I forgot
my inhaler that day.

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:35.864
I just couldn't breathe.

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:40.002
Everybody was standing around
staring at me.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:43.138
The kids and the teachers.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.374
But not Calvin.

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:50.445
He remembered that
Mr. agathapals, the janitor,
also had asthma.

01:00:50.513 --> 01:00:54.149
Calvin ran inside,
got his inhaler
and brought it to me.

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:56.551
Came and saw me every day
while I was in the hospital.

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:58.353
Read me comic books.

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.255
Let me guess.
<i>Gotham man.</i>

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:01.790
<i>Gotham man.</i>

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.793
<i>Dark dragon chronicles.</i>

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:09.765
So there really is
a heart of gold
in there.

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:12.801
Yeah. It's just deep.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:15.904
Deep down sometimes.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.845
Hey! I'm here
for the follow-up interview.

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:27.215
Ahh. We've been
expecting you.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:29.618
Please...

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.421
Have a seat.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.093
Where's tycho?

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:39.828
This is about him, remember?

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.668
Good job!

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.403
Here we are.

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:50.405
Ahh. Lunch is served.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.140
Thank you, tycho.

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.342
Thank you, Calvin.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.711
Yeah, thank you, tycho.

01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:00.549
Calvin: I mean,
you're joking, right?

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:02.951
You don't honestly think
that <i> avenging Angie</i>

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.753
is a better comic
than <i> Gotham man?</i>

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:08.090
Come on. Better artwork,
better storylines,

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.558
more complex characters.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.126
Listen, lady, ok?

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:12.861
<i>Gotham man</i> is an icon.

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:14.863
You know what? You're
just lucky that I'm here

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:17.132
to evaluate your
qualifications as a dog owner

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.268
and not your taste in comics.

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.072
Or your videogame skills.

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.907
That was luck.

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:27.409
You know it.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.478
See you later.

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:33.315
Um, Emily, um...

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.118
The spring dance is next week.

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.754
I was just wondering

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.622
if you wanted to go.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.124
I mean...

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.626
With me.

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:48.730
You have very impressive
qualifications, Calvin.

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.966
I do have one question
for you, however.

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.567
Oh, yeah, sure, anything.

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:56.171
Do you look spectacular
in all spring colors?

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.641
That's a trick question
and, uh...

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:01.409
You know I do.

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:02.978
Pick me up at 8:00 then.

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.947
But still, we're looking
for a fantastic weekend.

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.283
The top dog final,
presented by royal...

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:09.584
Oh, well, you know...

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:12.587
No, no, no, no.
Stop.

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:14.689
Comes up tomorrow at 3 P.M.

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:17.025
Two-time defending champion
Preston price says
his dog Jacques...

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.660
Of course it would be him.

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.195
Will take on the newcomer
Calvin Wheeler

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:23.899
and his dog tycho, or as
some are calling him...

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.267
I should have known.

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:27.469
Thank you, Jim.
In local news...

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:28.870
Emily.

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.639
Emily, wait.

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:34.142
You know what?
Let me ask you something.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.077
What were you going
to do with tycho

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.613
<i>after</i> you were done
using him to make your money?

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:40.015
Take him back to the shelter?

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:42.751
Look, no, no, no.
That was just the way
it started.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:46.121
Oh, but wait.
You've changed.

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:47.455
Yes.

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:49.357
Now you have a heart of gold
and you really love tycho.

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:51.893
That's it.
That's right.

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.295
That is exactly right.

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.963
Then prove it.

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:57.132
Don't enter him in that show.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.501
Drop out now.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:03.004
Good-bye, Calvin.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.075
Figg: Calvin!

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.311
Hey, Emily.

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:13.148
We have a problem.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:15.584
Tycho has a home.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:16.785
He has a family that misses him.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:20.088
Look. They're even offering
a reward to get him back.

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.123
How many flyers did you see?

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.991
They're everywhere.
They're all over the town.

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.095
Take them all down.

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:29.564
What?

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:31.466
I'm... I'm not
losing tycho.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.301
Not now.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.804
Calvin, this is his home.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.772
His real home where he belongs.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.040
Says who?

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:40.976
Calvin, look at it this way.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.912
If you lost tycho,
you'd want him back, right?

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.547
Just do it, Figg!

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.415
Now.

01:04:58.127 --> 01:04:59.761
No.

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:00.929
What?

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.965
What did you say to me?

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.567
"He's selfish.

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.302
He only cares about himself."

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.704
That's what they all
say about you, Calvin.

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:12.908
But I never thought
that they were right.

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:15.176
Till now.

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:31.927
I want to keep tycho
more than anything.

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.333
I know you'll do
the right thing, son.

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:04.359
Um... Yeah, I have your dog.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:07.929
Great.
I can't believe it.

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.798
Look, honey!
It's Chester!

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:11.866
Chester.

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.668
Woman: Oh, look.

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:16.738
Chester! Come here, honey.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.473
Come give mama a kiss.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:20.575
Ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.110
Go on, tycho.

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:23.511
I mean...

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:25.981
Chester.

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:28.850
Thank you.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:31.686
For bringing him home to us.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:33.321
Billy, go get the reward.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:35.190
No, no, no.

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.424
Keep the money. I...

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.259
I don't want it.

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:42.998
Just promise me
you'll take good care of him.

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.966
Yeah, sure.
No problem.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.611
Stay.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.446
You hear me?

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:01.216
Stay.

01:07:53.185 --> 01:07:54.219
Hey.

01:07:54.286 --> 01:07:56.955
Hey, where's tycho?

01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:59.691
Um...

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.727
I took him home.

01:08:02.795 --> 01:08:06.297
But the top dog finals is today.

01:08:09.135 --> 01:08:10.802
I know.

01:08:15.641 --> 01:08:17.509
Emily!

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:21.078
Hey!

01:08:21.147 --> 01:08:22.247
Get out of here.

01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:24.448
I want you to know something.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:27.318
Calvin gave tycho back
to his real family

01:08:27.386 --> 01:08:29.120
and didn't accept a reward.

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:30.921
Wait a minute.

01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:32.756
Yeah. You can say
a lot of bad things
about Calvin.

01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:34.158
They're probably true,

01:08:34.225 --> 01:08:36.694
but you can't say
he doesn't love
that dog.

01:08:36.761 --> 01:08:39.697
This photo of tycho, i took it.

01:08:39.765 --> 01:08:41.131
No, it's impossible.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.700
That was taken
by his real family.

01:08:42.768 --> 01:08:44.569
Unh-unh. Look.

01:08:46.906 --> 01:08:49.506
I took this photo
when they first brought
tycho into the shelter.

01:08:49.575 --> 01:08:51.242
But... but that means that

01:08:51.277 --> 01:08:54.779
this flyer couldn't
have been put up by
tycho's family.

01:08:55.948 --> 01:08:57.682
Something's not right.

01:09:00.452 --> 01:09:01.786
Calvin!

01:09:02.755 --> 01:09:05.156
What's up, Figg?

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.425
Look at this.

01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:12.897
It was Preston!

01:09:12.965 --> 01:09:14.465
You know what?

01:09:14.533 --> 01:09:16.334
He made up those flyers
and posted them himself.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.236
He did it all.

01:09:18.304 --> 01:09:20.238
He knew how much
i cared about tycho,

01:09:20.305 --> 01:09:22.740
how much I wanted
to do what was best
for him

01:09:22.808 --> 01:09:24.609
and get him back
to his real family.

01:09:24.676 --> 01:09:25.810
Except they're not
his real family.

01:09:25.877 --> 01:09:27.178
They're phonies!

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:28.580
So who are they?

01:09:28.647 --> 01:09:30.048
They had to be somebody
Preston could control.

01:09:30.115 --> 01:09:32.250
Preston: Not there,
you dufus.

01:09:32.283 --> 01:09:34.452
Calvin: I knew that guy
looked familiar!

01:09:34.486 --> 01:09:36.087
So what now?

01:09:36.154 --> 01:09:37.488
Now we get him back!

01:09:41.327 --> 01:09:42.727
That's tycho.

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:51.135
Oh, my goodness.

01:09:51.203 --> 01:09:53.270
Woman: I don't care
what we're gettin' paid!

01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:56.207
I want that beast gone
and I mean now.

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:57.909
We should get help.

01:09:57.977 --> 01:09:59.010
Man: Fine!

01:09:59.078 --> 01:10:01.746
Dude, there's no time for help.

01:10:01.847 --> 01:10:03.014
Ok, Figg,

01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:04.382
you go knock on the door.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:05.984
Keep 'em talking, ok?

01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:07.218
We'll sneak in through the back.

01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:08.586
I'm gonna go with him.

01:10:08.654 --> 01:10:09.821
No, Calvin, wait a second.

01:10:09.889 --> 01:10:12.757
I... I'm not you.
I mean...

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:14.325
You know, I'm not good at lying.

01:10:14.393 --> 01:10:17.262
Figg, don't think of it
as lying, ok? Remember...

01:10:17.329 --> 01:10:19.230
Shh!

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:22.967
Ok. Do you remember
issue 426 of <i> the dark</i>
<i>dragon chronicles</i>

01:10:23.035 --> 01:10:25.770
when Gotham man had to
provide a distraction?

01:10:25.838 --> 01:10:28.139
Oh, so the justice
legion could sneak
through the dark...

01:10:28.207 --> 01:10:29.240
All: Dragon's lair.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:30.441
I got it. Got it.

01:10:30.509 --> 01:10:32.310
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

01:10:37.616 --> 01:10:39.417
Woman: Take
the dog and... shh!

01:10:41.954 --> 01:10:44.923
Good afternoon, sir.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.927
I'm here to give you
the opportunity

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:51.329
to subscribe

01:10:51.397 --> 01:10:54.499
to these... these
leading magazines

01:10:54.566 --> 01:10:56.567
at a generous discount.

01:10:56.635 --> 01:10:57.568
Woman: What is goin' on,
Billy?

01:10:57.636 --> 01:10:59.537
Some kid sellin' magazines.

01:11:03.442 --> 01:11:05.677
Kid, we don't want no magazines.

01:11:16.755 --> 01:11:17.922
What's wrong with you, boy?

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:19.624
Are you ok, hon?

01:11:19.658 --> 01:11:21.292
What's his problem?

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.460
Ugh!

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.129
I think he has the asthma,

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:27.498
you know, like my cousin Gayle?

01:11:32.237 --> 01:11:33.671
If he dies on our porch,

01:11:33.739 --> 01:11:35.073
he can probably sue us
or something, right?

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:37.709
Shut up, Billy!

01:11:47.019 --> 01:11:48.886
You feeling better, hon?

01:11:48.954 --> 01:11:51.022
Much. Thank you.

01:11:54.893 --> 01:11:56.361
Oh, tycho!

01:11:56.428 --> 01:11:58.529
Aah!

01:11:59.665 --> 01:12:02.667
Hey, Figg, when do
the top dog finals start?

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:05.470
8 minutes and 22 seconds ago.

01:12:05.537 --> 01:12:06.971
Why?

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:11.476
You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking.

01:12:11.543 --> 01:12:13.378
You and tycho have to compete.

01:12:13.445 --> 01:12:15.246
And you have to win!

01:12:15.314 --> 01:12:16.314
Otherwise Preston will.

01:12:16.382 --> 01:12:17.715
It's up to him.

01:12:17.783 --> 01:12:18.883
What do you say, boy?

01:12:18.951 --> 01:12:22.820
Up for getting exploited
one more time?

01:12:28.894 --> 01:12:31.496
Dad, gun it! We have
a dog show to win!

01:12:31.563 --> 01:12:33.398
Buckle up, everybody.

01:12:33.465 --> 01:12:34.766
Welcome back to
the top dog finals,

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:37.135
sponsored by royal hound
dog foods.

01:12:37.202 --> 01:12:40.838
This year's theme,
around the world
in 80 dogs.

01:12:40.906 --> 01:12:42.607
Contestants have just 90 seconds

01:12:42.674 --> 01:12:45.376
to impress the judges
with any performance
routine.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:48.579
Jessica rose and her dog
chichi are just
finishing up

01:12:48.647 --> 01:12:51.182
next to the display
of the arful tower.

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:53.785
That's going to bring up
this show's

01:12:53.852 --> 01:12:55.520
two-time defending champions.

01:12:55.587 --> 01:12:59.791
That's right, Chuck,
it's Preston price
and Jacques!

01:13:13.038 --> 01:13:15.540
Ok. Go.

01:13:45.204 --> 01:13:46.671
Audience: Ooh!

01:13:50.909 --> 01:13:52.910
Where is Calvin and tycho?

01:13:52.945 --> 01:13:54.645
We are up next.

01:13:56.482 --> 01:13:58.249
Calvin, what are you gonna do?

01:13:58.317 --> 01:14:00.017
You and tycho don't even
have a routine.

01:14:01.386 --> 01:14:03.321
I think we might.

01:14:03.388 --> 01:14:04.789
Right, tycho?

01:14:17.836 --> 01:14:19.303
Holly:
And what a catch!

01:14:19.371 --> 01:14:20.538
What are those, Chuck?

01:14:20.572 --> 01:14:21.506
Flying disks, Holly.

01:14:21.573 --> 01:14:23.174
Wow!

01:14:34.253 --> 01:14:35.653
Chuck: Fantastic!

01:14:35.687 --> 01:14:37.522
Holly: Ooh lala, Jacques!

01:14:41.527 --> 01:14:42.960
Chuck: Wow!

01:14:51.937 --> 01:14:54.605
A flawless routine
by the champion!

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:02.780
Here comes scores.

01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:06.083
Chuck: A 98!
Unbelievable!

01:15:06.151 --> 01:15:09.720
Ooh, that is going to be
nearly impossible to beat.

01:15:09.788 --> 01:15:13.224
It's gonna get rough
in there, Chuck.

01:15:17.563 --> 01:15:21.632
Next up is Calvin Wheeler
and tycho.

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.601
Don't hold your breath.

01:15:34.513 --> 01:15:36.347
This is the final call

01:15:36.415 --> 01:15:39.317
for Calvin Wheeler and tycho.

01:15:42.354 --> 01:15:43.354
Go, tycho!

01:15:43.422 --> 01:15:45.156
Go!

01:15:50.028 --> 01:15:53.297
It looks like there's
going to be a disqualification.

01:15:53.365 --> 01:15:56.133
Let's go, baby! Wow!

01:15:57.703 --> 01:16:00.137
Don't roll over yet.
Look!

01:16:01.506 --> 01:16:03.207
Audience: Ohh!

01:16:14.553 --> 01:16:15.820
There, baby!

01:16:15.887 --> 01:16:17.054
Oh, cool!

01:16:20.392 --> 01:16:21.859
Whoa!

01:16:26.064 --> 01:16:27.231
Audience: Ohh!

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.418
Surprised?

01:16:47.486 --> 01:16:50.755
You and your no-good mutt
still have to beat a 98.

01:16:52.424 --> 01:16:53.691
It's impossible.

01:16:55.327 --> 01:16:58.562
You may begin,
Mr. Wheeler.

01:16:59.464 --> 01:17:01.065
All right.
Full speed, tycho.

01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:02.800
Full speed.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:03.968
Chuck: Ok, Holly.
Calvin and tycho

01:17:04.002 --> 01:17:06.270
have one minute
and 30 seconds to impress

01:17:06.338 --> 01:17:08.406
the judges in this
freestyle exhibition.

01:17:08.473 --> 01:17:11.676
Holly: Let's see what
they have in their
bag of tricks.

01:17:27.459 --> 01:17:31.128
Holly: He is headed
for the fabled windmills
of our dog quixote display.

01:17:31.196 --> 01:17:34.565
The audience is just
lapping this up!

01:17:37.369 --> 01:17:39.470
Chuck: Holly, they're racing
right for the arful tower.

01:17:39.538 --> 01:17:40.738
And they're through!

01:17:40.772 --> 01:17:42.540
Holly: Both Calvin
and tycho are headed for

01:17:42.607 --> 01:17:45.409
the ancient druid ruins
of bonehenge!

01:17:50.048 --> 01:17:55.820
Oh, wow! Now
they're on the way
to mount ruffmore's half pipe!

01:17:55.887 --> 01:17:59.290
And they are moving!

01:18:26.918 --> 01:18:29.120
Go, Calvin!

01:18:53.378 --> 01:18:56.313
Did you see that?
Calvin just skated right over

01:18:56.381 --> 01:18:59.116
the waters of
the south paw-cific!

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:03.621
Chuck: Now they're headed
for the bridge too fur.

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:11.228
Calvin and tycho are
going to have time

01:19:11.296 --> 01:19:12.797
for just one more trick, Holly.

01:19:12.864 --> 01:19:15.966
That's right, Chuck,
and they are picking up
some serious speed.

01:19:25.877 --> 01:19:27.244
Chuck: Ohh!

01:19:27.312 --> 01:19:31.382
Ohh!

01:19:34.219 --> 01:19:35.252
Ohh!

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.655
Aah!

01:19:41.693 --> 01:19:45.796
And Calvin sticks the landing!

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:48.933
Well, how I'd do?

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:50.701
Man: It's obvious
Preston sabotaged the event.

01:19:50.735 --> 01:19:51.869
He's disqualified.

01:19:51.903 --> 01:19:54.138
Boy: Preston price cheated.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:55.873
Woman: That's what we'll do.

01:19:55.941 --> 01:19:57.174
Let's wrap it up.

01:19:57.242 --> 01:19:59.910
We award the routine...

01:20:00.946 --> 01:20:02.680
A 99!

01:20:03.415 --> 01:20:05.449
That's it! Fame!

01:20:05.517 --> 01:20:08.385
Calvin Wheeler
and his dog tycho
the terrible

01:20:08.453 --> 01:20:12.289
have just won
royal hound's
top dog final!

01:20:13.925 --> 01:20:14.992
All right, Calvin!

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:17.461
Go, baby!
Hold it there, Calvin!

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:31.976
Tycho, Calvin, this way!

01:20:32.043 --> 01:20:33.511
Figg:
Guys, guys, please!

01:20:33.578 --> 01:20:35.846
Please, one at a time!

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:37.515
How prepared were you?
You.

01:20:37.582 --> 01:20:40.084
Emily Watson,
<i>bedford animal shelter</i>

01:20:40.151 --> 01:20:41.185
<i>monthly newsletter.</i>

01:20:41.219 --> 01:20:42.319
Yes?

01:20:42.387 --> 01:20:43.721
Calvin, I was wondering,

01:20:43.788 --> 01:20:46.323
do you have any plans
for the prize money?

01:20:50.061 --> 01:20:51.562
I sure do.

01:21:03.008 --> 01:21:05.543
And just who was
Stewart bickford?

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.512
The creator of <i> Gotham man.</i>

01:21:10.048 --> 01:21:14.218
These renovations were
only made possible by
a generous donation

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:16.220
from Calvin Wheeler and his dog,

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:19.790
a former resident
of this shelter,

01:21:19.858 --> 01:21:21.358
tycho the terrible!

01:21:26.331 --> 01:21:28.299
You did it, Calvin.

01:21:40.579 --> 01:21:42.513
Girl: Cute.
You're a chatty dog.

01:21:42.581 --> 01:21:44.315
You're a little too chatty
for our house.

01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:46.483
Calvin: You know what?

01:21:46.551 --> 01:21:48.586
If we're ever going
to get Rufus a home,

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:51.221
we've got to work
on his social skills.

01:21:51.289 --> 01:21:52.790
Rufus?

01:21:52.857 --> 01:21:55.259
You know what
Mr. Dudley says about
naming the animals.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:58.362
What can I say? He looks like
a little Rufus to me.

01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:00.130
Guys, he's just
scared, that's all.

01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:06.737
Hey, buddy.

01:22:06.805 --> 01:22:08.272
Hey, little guy.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.573
Hiya.

01:22:09.641 --> 01:22:12.009
Would you look at that.

01:22:12.877 --> 01:22:16.647
Figg, he actually likes you.

01:22:16.715 --> 01:22:17.581
You know what?

01:22:17.649 --> 01:22:20.618
I'd say 5.2,
maybe 5.3 pounds.

01:22:20.685 --> 01:22:24.355
Definitely under
the weight limit
for my apartment complex.

01:22:24.422 --> 01:22:27.691
Looks like and tycho
have some stiff
competition

01:22:27.759 --> 01:22:28.926
for next year's dog show.

01:22:28.994 --> 01:22:30.294
Ha! Please.

01:22:30.328 --> 01:22:32.429
After the performance
tycho and I gave,

01:22:32.464 --> 01:22:34.698
I don't think there is
a dog on this earth...

01:22:34.766 --> 01:22:36.100
Come on, buddy.

01:22:36.167 --> 01:22:37.334
Ok, that can...

01:22:37.402 --> 01:22:38.435
Oh, yes.

01:22:38.503 --> 01:22:41.905
You're such a good boy.
Yes, you are.

01:22:41.973 --> 01:22:44.274
You have got to be kiddin' me.

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:52.816
You know what, Figg?

01:22:52.884 --> 01:22:53.984
Figg, wait.

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:55.719
How about we team up?

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.721
You, me, our dogs, you know?

01:22:57.789 --> 01:23:02.760
We can do this
kind of tag team
tandem thing.

01:23:02.827 --> 01:23:05.329
Yeah. I mean,
we can't lose.

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:06.664
At the very least,

01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:09.099
you gonna need a manager.

01:23:09.167 --> 01:23:12.202
You know, someone
to help you count
that money.

01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:15.773
Mm-hmm. He's gonna
be our little star.
