Your nervous system is shutting down.

You're dying.

09:05.941 --> 09:07.011
What can we do?

09:07.011 --> 09:08.891
We can attempt to minimize the damage

09:08.907 --> 09:11.788

neurotoxin from your blood.

09:11.791 --> 09:12.985
How can we do that?

a filtration system

remaining toxin from your blood.

You think that'll save me?

Even if we're successful
in removing the toxin,

09:22.232 --> 09:24.267
too much damage may
already have been done.

09:24.301 --> 09:27.003

All right.

Under the circumstances,
are you sure you don't want

09:30.608 --> 09:33.209
to give us the coordinates
to the leadership summit?

We've already been over this.

communication have failed,

09:38.015 --> 09:39.373

giving us the coordinates,

The Galactic Authority

that just opens up potential

once Ferrous Corp runs

downloaded his old memories,

something about my past

put himself in a position

39:47.388 --> 39:49.294
it's like starting the clock,

Hmm.
