WEBVTT

00:18.351 --> 00:19.269
No!

00:21.980 --> 00:23.648
-Anna!

00:29.112 --> 00:30.321
Buell!

00:49.716 --> 00:51.426
-No!

00:58.933 --> 01:00.226
I'm coming, Emma.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.859
Come on, Anna. It's just fucking rain.

01:34.844 --> 01:40.517
You got
some of their mail by mistake, Miss Anna.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.685
I was just trying…

01:49.442 --> 01:52.612
But if you're not the killer, then who…

01:53.154 --> 01:54.030
who…

01:54.864 --> 01:55.698
Neil.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.285
-Daddy, no!
-Don't hurt her!

02:04.874 --> 02:05.959
Huh?

02:09.629 --> 02:10.505
Emma.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.635
People always underestimate children,
underestimate what they're capable of.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.555
I even surprise myself.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.683
I mean, I didn't know
I was capable of murder.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.476
Oh my God.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.271
<i>You</i> killed Lisa.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.772
You're smarter than you look.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.110
I don't understand. Why?

02:36.531 --> 02:40.368
Okay, kiddo. I gotta go to the airport.
I'll see you later, little lady.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.495
Oh, Lisa, before you go,

02:42.579 --> 02:44.998
could you buy some chocolate bars?

02:45.081 --> 02:46.708
Oh. I wish I could.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.043
Remember what I always tell you?

02:50.044 --> 02:52.213
Sugar is the worst thing
you can put in your body.

02:54.799 --> 02:55.800
Bye.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.898
Hey, Lisa?

03:09.981 --> 03:10.899
Yeah.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.569
I don't think sugar is
the worst thing you can put in your body.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.156
I think this is.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.380
How could you do something like that?

03:34.464 --> 03:36.382
I didn't do it. You did.

03:37.008 --> 03:40.511
Don't the police have a palette knife
with your fingerprints on it?

03:43.097 --> 03:45.767
-I'm gonna go get my checkbook. Okay?
-Okay.

03:46.434 --> 03:49.103
<i>I remembered</i>
<i>you keep your checkbook upstairs,</i>

03:49.687 --> 03:53.942
<i>which gave me the perfect opportunity</i>
<i>to steal your palette knife</i>

03:54.609 --> 03:55.902
<i>and frame you for murder.</i>

03:56.402 --> 04:00.657
I don't understand.
Your dad was here when you killed Lisa.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.700
How did he not h… hear anything?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.118
How did he not know?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.537
He was upstairs in the bathroom
with the water running.

04:06.621 --> 04:10.917
<i>He didn't want anyone to hear him</i>
<i>practicing his ventriloquist act.</i>

04:11.834 --> 04:13.836
His act sucks by the way,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.255
which is why I killed him.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.465
You're a monster.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.635
No. My mother was the monster.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.766
<i>Can you believe</i>
<i>she decided to have another baby</i>

04:26.849 --> 04:29.352
<i>without even asking if I wanted a sibling?</i>

04:29.978 --> 04:32.063
<i>Well, I had something else in mind.</i>

04:33.606 --> 04:37.277
<i>I spent all summer</i>
<i>on my underwater project,</i>

04:37.360 --> 04:41.572
<i>and on the last day of our vacation,</i>
<i>it was finally ready.</i>

04:42.365 --> 04:44.993
<i>I just needed to lure her</i>
<i>to the end of the dock.</i>

04:51.040 --> 04:52.583
Emma?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.128
Emma.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.547
You know what?
I think I prefer being an only child.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.716
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.009
No!

05:07.056 --> 05:08.766
You're not gonna get away with this.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.184
Oh yes, I will,

05:10.268 --> 05:12.812
because you're the only one
who knows the truth.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.189
And now I'm gonna kill you.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.442
In self-defense, of course.

05:18.318 --> 05:22.155
The mean drunk lady across the street
tried to kill me.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.037
You're fucking crazy.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.707
Huh. That's what my teacher said
before I pushed her off the lighthouse.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.012
Shit!

06:27.136 --> 06:29.555
Those are just baby teeth,
you stupid asshole.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.101
Where's his gun?
Where does he keep it?

06:53.663 --> 06:54.622
Where is it?

06:56.874 --> 06:58.376
-Looking for this?

07:03.756 --> 07:05.716
You little bitch.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.887
Come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.477
<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

07:57.560 --> 07:59.520
Our crazy neighbor

08:00.021 --> 08:01.606
killed my daddy.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.733
I think I killed her

08:04.734 --> 08:05.776
in self-defense.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.113
<i> It's okay, honey.</i>
<i>Where are you? What's your address?</i>

08:09.197 --> 08:12.074
407 Canterbury Hill.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.034
Hurry.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.786
<i> We're on our way.</i>
<i>Just stay on the line with me.</i>

08:21.417 --> 08:22.960
<i>Are you somewhere safe--</i>

08:30.927 --> 08:33.804
Well, well, well.

08:34.555 --> 08:38.100
Someone doesn't know when to die.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.024
-Pick up.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.275
Pick up, pick up.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.622
You know, it didn't have to end this way.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.749
I tried to warn you.

09:09.382 --> 09:14.262
By the way,
your casserole tastes like shit.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.018
Anna. Oh my God.

09:21.102 --> 09:21.978
Anna.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.023
Anna. Anna.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.984
Stay with me, Anna.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.279
Hey. You're gonna be okay.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.198
Yeah? It's all gonna be okay.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.326
-Yeah. Okay.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.556
Knock, knock.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.141
How's the patient?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.518
I brought you these.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.270
They're beautiful.

10:04.854 --> 10:05.896
How are you feeling?

10:05.980 --> 10:08.149
Like I was hit by a Mack truck

10:08.733 --> 10:10.067
driven by a nine-year-old.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.991
Anna, I owe you an apology.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.328
You were right about all of it.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.917
You have no idea how long
I have been wanting to hear that.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.088
H… how's the patient?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.841
This guy.
You're lucky he showed up when he did,

10:33.924 --> 10:36.719
otherwise you might've been charged
for murdering Neil and Emma too.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.347
And Buell. Oh, poor Buell.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.474
-Buell made it, Anna.
-What?

10:41.557 --> 10:44.602
Yeah. He's in intensive care,
but he's… he's gonna make it.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.646
Thank God.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.732
Well, I better get back to the station.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.986
You take care of yourself, Anna.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.780
Thanks, Detective Lane.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.865
Hey. Call me Becky.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.206
I… I brought you these.

11:05.706 --> 11:06.832
They're beautiful.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.417
How you feeling?

11:08.918 --> 11:11.504
Like I was hit by a Mack truck

11:11.587 --> 11:13.255
driven by a nine-year-old.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.594
Anna, I… I owe you an apology.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.389
I kept telling you that old houses creak.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.515
Oh, Douglas, no.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.684
No.
I… I should've listened to you.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.936
-I should've believed you.
-It's okay.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.398
I barely believed myself.

11:31.899 --> 11:35.736
Well, that's also something
I should apologize for.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.865
I realized I had you on a 50-gram dose

11:39.949 --> 11:42.159
of a class-four psychotropic, and I…

11:43.244 --> 11:46.956
Well, I probably should have just had you
on, like, a prescription

11:47.039 --> 11:49.083
for Wellbutrin or Zoloft.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.213
Well, the only prescription
I think I need right now is rest.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.426
Thank you for always being there for me.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.139
I'll always be here for you.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.393
Douglas, do you ever wonder if we c…

12:08.853 --> 12:09.687
What?

12:12.314 --> 12:13.399
Nothing.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.200
I better get back to work.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.535
-Okay.
-All right.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.133
How's the patient?

12:39.216 --> 12:40.092
Carol.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.470
I brought you these.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.555
They're beautiful.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.599
How are you feeling?

12:47.767 --> 12:48.642
Uh,

12:49.435 --> 12:51.270
like I was hit by a Mack truck

12:51.896 --> 12:53.689
driven by a nine-year-old.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.820
Oh. You're talking about Emma. Yeah.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.533
Anna, I owe you an apology.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.536
-Oh?
-Yes. I do.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.623
You did see something that night,

13:10.706 --> 13:15.002
and I didn't believe you
because I judged you,

13:15.085 --> 13:16.504
and that's wrong.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.799
And it takes a big person
to admit when they're wrong.

13:21.675 --> 13:22.510
Well,

13:23.886 --> 13:26.597
I'd say it takes a big person
to admit when they're wrong,

13:26.680 --> 13:29.350
but you already said that.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.018
Thank you.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.647
Well, um,

13:34.730 --> 13:36.857
I should probably get back to Scott.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.509
Hungry for some lunch?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.511
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.473
-Uh, Miss Anna.
-Hmm?

14:09.974 --> 14:12.810
Uh, I wanted to apologize to you.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.729
I should have told you
I was living up here. I just didn't

14:17.147 --> 14:19.650
feel right leaving you all alone at night

14:19.733 --> 14:22.695
in this big house after Mr. Douglas left.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.406
It's all right, Buell.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
Your heart was in the right place.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.832
I'm gonna turn him into a lamp.

14:38.752 --> 14:39.628
Oh.

14:41.839 --> 14:45.342
It's like I got hit by a Mack truck
driven by a nine-year-old.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.765
Would you excuse me one second?

14:54.059 --> 14:54.977
It sold?

14:55.060 --> 14:57.354
Of course it sold.
Look at it. It's stunning.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.193
-I don't know. I just…

15:03.861 --> 15:06.447
I am so proud of you.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.781
Thank you.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.622
-What was that?
-What?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.707
-What "what"? What was that?
-It's no one.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.460
-Why are you being weird?
-I'm not being weird. It was nobody.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.337
Who just called you?

15:22.463 --> 15:24.214
All right. It's Graham and Prine.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.385
-They made me an offer.
-They did?

15:28.469 --> 15:29.887
Oh, Sloane.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.598
-Oh, congratulations. That's amazing.
-Thank you.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.433
Yeah. I'm gonna turn it down.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.143
Why? No.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.228
No. Not again.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.565
I know why you turned
the offer down the first time.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.778
You thought you needed
to take care of me after Elizabeth died.

15:47.696 --> 15:48.656
And I let you.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.076
Look, you were never gonna talk me
out of it.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.203
Well, I'm gonna talk you out of it now.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.996
-You are taking this job.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.290
-Anna--
-You are taking this job.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.084
You have to, Sloane.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.253
I'm okay. I'm gonna be okay.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.506
God.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.759
-Do it. Call them back for me. Please?
-Hmm.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.803
Okay, okay.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.930
Will you come and visit me in New York?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.598
Obviously. Yes. Of course.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.810
-Just call them right now. Okay? Please?

16:37.579 --> 16:38.747
Are you leaving?

16:39.748 --> 16:41.542
I didn't get a chance to say hello.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.628
Um, hello.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.923
Yeah. I'm just not yet feeling 100%, so…

16:48.007 --> 16:49.008
Of course.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.970
Um, well, the painting is stunning.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.514
I think it's the best you've ever done.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.225
Thank you.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.605
Anna, this is Claire.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.690
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.233
I've heard so much about you.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.151
Oh.

17:08.485 --> 17:09.570
Thank you.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.365
So how did you two meet?

17:13.449 --> 17:15.451
Oh, they just assigned her to me.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.288
Claire's one heck
of a forensic psychiatrist.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.332
Oh, you work together.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.251
Yeah. What'd you think?

17:27.629 --> 17:29.006
May I walk you to your car?

17:31.884 --> 17:32.968
Sure.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.347
Mm.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.727
I, uh, really, really want you to know

17:41.810 --> 17:44.855
just how beautiful
I thought that painting was.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.315
Aw. Thank you.

17:47.107 --> 17:50.694
Of course, you're gonna have to help me
figure out where to hang it.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.198
You bought it?

18:06.043 --> 18:08.462
-Let's get you inside.
-Actually, wait.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.214
I think I'm okay.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.094
Yeah.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.138
I'm gonna be just fine.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.797
There's breast milk in the freezer,
extra passies are in her room,

18:51.880 --> 18:54.216
and remember, you have to swaddle her
tighter than you think.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.093
Honey, we're fine.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.845
Remember I've done this before.

18:58.846 --> 18:59.930
You just try to relax

19:00.013 --> 19:02.599
and enjoy your girls' weekend
with Sloane. Okay?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.977
I know, I just…
You know I don't like flying, so…

19:05.060 --> 19:07.271
Yeah. You have
your Xanax prescription if you need it.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.939
Yes.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.024
I just miss you two so much already.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.026
We miss you too.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.028
Here's what I want you to do.

19:15.112 --> 19:19.241
<i>Have fun, okay,</i>
<i>and not worry about a single thing.</i>

19:19.324 --> 19:21.076
<i>-Deal?</i>
-Deal.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.661
Excuse me.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.586
Uh, red or white?

19:30.669 --> 19:33.213
Oh. No, thank you.
I don't drink wine anymore.

19:33.714 --> 19:34.631
I'll have a vodka.

19:42.848 --> 19:43.932
Okay.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.252
I believe you're in my seat.

20:12.836 --> 20:13.670
2A.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.215
Oh.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.382
Sorry.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.523
I'm kind of a nervous flier.

20:34.024 --> 20:37.152
But I'm visiting a friend, so you have to.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.614
What takes you to New York?

20:42.950 --> 20:43.784
Business.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.813
Thank you.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.535
-No, you have to see the show.

21:27.035 --> 21:27.995
Yeah. It's imper--

21:28.078 --> 21:31.164
Um, she… she's dead.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.875
-What?
-Come look in the lavatory.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.168
Come look.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.336
Oh my God.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.555
-Okay. Let's get you back to your seat.
-What?

21:46.638 --> 21:48.849
All right? And I will get you some coffee.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.851
No, no, no.
I'm telling you, she was in there.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.019
Okay. Who was?

21:52.102 --> 21:54.980
The woman sitting next to me.
The woman in seat 2A.

21:55.063 --> 21:58.483
Ma'am, there was no one in seat 2A.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.522
Bingo.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.005
