01:10.432 --> 01:14.093
I have lived through many ages...

01:15.240 --> 01:17.155
through the eyes of salmon,

01:17.156 --> 01:19.519
deer,

01:19.520 --> 01:21.980
and wolf.

01:23.283 --> 01:29.833
I have seen the North Men invading Ireland
destroying homes, in search of gold.

01:39.682 --> 01:44.017
I have seen suffering
in the darkness,

01:48.719 --> 01:55.269
yet... I have seen beauty
thrive in the most fragile of places.

01:57.393 --> 02:04.943
I have seen the book... the book
that turned darkness... into light.

02:22.512 --> 02:26.385
Brendan?
Don't let her get away!

02:32.705 --> 02:37.026
Come on!
Nice goosy, goosy, goosy...

02:42.107 --> 02:45.752
Stand back,
I will get her!

02:58.636 --> 03:01.833
- Which way?
- Baah...

03:13.797 --> 03:16.253
Brendan!
That scaffolding is not steady!

03:16.254 --> 03:20.460
Don't worry, brother Assoua,
I'll be careful.

03:22.337 --> 03:24.333
Sorry.

03:39.198 --> 03:41.109
Brendan!

03:41.110 --> 03:43.185
Coming!

03:51.063 --> 03:52.465
- Brendan.
- Brendan!

03:52.466 --> 03:54.815
Are you hurt?

04:27.340 --> 04:30.362
Keep it quiet, Brendan!
Or the Abbot will hear.

04:30.363 --> 04:36.538
I'm sorry, but we have to do this.
It will all be over in a minute.

04:38.927 --> 04:41.818
Now, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

04:41.819 --> 04:44.640
Lucky bird.

04:44.641 --> 04:46.827
Your feathers
will become the tools...

04:46.828 --> 04:51.488
from which we create
immortal pages of sacred text.

05:06.255 --> 05:08.278
Abbot! I explain for you...

05:08.279 --> 05:12.761
We tried to catch goose...
and she run very fast.

05:12.762 --> 05:15.392
And I fall in the mud...

05:15.393 --> 05:17.664
Forgive us, Abbot.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.177
Brendan! Where are those plans
I asked for?

05:20.178 --> 05:24.026
The plans...
I left them in the scriptorium.

05:24.027 --> 05:26.440
- Bring them to the tower.
- Yes uncle.

05:26.441 --> 05:31.596
Tomorrow, you will go back to work
on the wall, dawn till evening bell...

05:31.597 --> 05:33.767
and brother Leonardo...

05:33.768 --> 05:38.133
clean yourself up
for pity's sake.

05:43.787 --> 05:46.611
I do not know why
there are at it this intense...

05:46.612 --> 05:49.101
when all that man wants us to do
is to build his crazy wall.

05:49.102 --> 05:51.917
Yes, that's all the man cares about,
nothing else,

05:51.918 --> 05:54.217
and you continue
to defend him, Brendan!

05:54.218 --> 05:57.003
Uncle just wants to protect us
from outside.

05:57.004 --> 05:59.290
When the North Men come to Kells,

05:59.291 --> 06:02.140
they'll make no distinction
between young and old. So...

06:02.141 --> 06:04.886
"Prepare or meet your doom!"

06:07.427 --> 06:10.609
You just don't understand...

06:11.381 --> 06:15.777
But Brendan, you've never been
outside these walls.

06:15.778 --> 06:18.572
I don't have to go outside
to know how dangerous it is.

06:18.573 --> 06:23.318
- Where have you all been?
- We went to get these, for you.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.607
You should have seen brother Sergey,

06:25.608 --> 06:28.597
he took a flying dive,
like a beautiful swan.

06:28.598 --> 06:30.836
It is not funny.

06:30.837 --> 06:35.298
The Abbot has seen us, he is not happy
because we are not working on the wall.

06:35.299 --> 06:39.863
Now enough of that! What about
the books? Does he not find them?

06:39.864 --> 06:45.849
If there were no books, all knowledge
would be lost... for ethernity.

06:46.045 --> 06:47.349
We cannot only build walls.

06:47.350 --> 06:50.497
The people must have books,
so that they may have hope.

06:50.498 --> 06:53.656
If we had a true master illuminator
would would do so much splendid work!

06:53.657 --> 06:56.738
Let us pray that one
will be delivered to us one day.

06:56.739 --> 06:57.928
- Let us Pray!
- Let us Pray!

06:57.929 --> 07:01.791
Surely you don't need a master,
your work is the finest I've seen...

07:01.792 --> 07:04.785
Thanks Brendan,
but we are mere scriblers...

07:04.786 --> 07:09.344
- next to true masters.
- True masters? Such as...?

07:09.345 --> 07:13.597
Such as...
Brother Aidan of lona.

07:13.598 --> 07:15.614
He is indeed the great one.

07:15.615 --> 07:17.597
Who is the brother Aidan?

07:17.598 --> 07:18.903
A sage.

07:18.904 --> 07:21.010
The wisest one of them all.

07:21.011 --> 07:23.082
The perfect Illuminator.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.160
Well where is he then?

07:24.161 --> 07:27.449
He lives on a tiny island
called lona.

07:27.765 --> 07:29.265
There is an abbey on the island,

07:29.266 --> 07:35.031
where he works on a magnificent book:
The Book of lona.

07:35.032 --> 07:38.732
The book was begun 200 years ago,

07:38.733 --> 07:43.782
under the orders of none other
than Saint Columb Kil himself.

07:44.207 --> 07:46.932
The Book of lona
outshines all others...

07:46.933 --> 07:49.752
because of the miracle
of Columb Kil's third eye...

07:49.753 --> 07:55.272
No, not because of his third eye, because
of his 3 hands with 12 fingers on each.

07:55.273 --> 07:58.196
That's not true! He had a third eye,
not a third hand!

07:58.197 --> 08:00.507
Have you not heard of the eye
of Columb Kil?

08:00.508 --> 08:04.062
Of course! But that was for
making the prophecies...

08:04.063 --> 08:07.793
His third hand was
for beginning the book.

08:07.794 --> 08:10.850
Enough! Just tell us about
Brother Aidan.

08:10.851 --> 08:16.619
His writings are said to glow
from the pages, as though they are light.

08:16.971 --> 08:20.194
Sinners have been blinded
while glansing upon the pages.

08:20.195 --> 08:23.383
For to gaze upon the book,
is to gaze upon the heavons itself!

08:23.384 --> 08:26.010
The Book of lona.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.329
But where is lona?

08:28.330 --> 08:33.669
It is far far away in the sea.
Like all islands should be.

08:33.671 --> 08:35.046
A beautiful place...

08:35.047 --> 08:38.976
where the illuminators
do not have to build walls.

08:38.977 --> 08:43.092
But the Abbot sais
that islands are too easy to attack.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.150
Brendan! Are you still here?

08:59.151 --> 09:02.462
You'd better bring the Abbot those plans,
or you'll be in big trouble!

09:02.463 --> 09:03.792
Uncle!

09:03.793 --> 09:05.618
Hurry boy!

09:13.427 --> 09:15.328
Here they are, uncle.

09:15.329 --> 09:19.289
Brendan! How am I to trust you
with responsablity...

09:19.290 --> 09:21.612
when you continue
to disappoint me?

09:21.613 --> 09:24.950
One day you will take control
of this Abbey.

09:24.951 --> 09:28.620
Yet, it takes you several hours
to fulfill a simple task.

09:28.621 --> 09:29.884
I'm sorry.

09:29.885 --> 09:35.257
The monks were talking about lona.
I dreamt it was destroyed.

09:35.258 --> 09:38.023
It was so real uncle!

09:38.221 --> 09:41.061
It is real Brendan.

09:42.260 --> 09:45.067
One day that horror
will come to us.

09:45.068 --> 09:49.113
That is exactly
why we must prepare ourselves.

10:07.147 --> 10:11.256
This section of the wall is supported
by 3 pillars: here, here and here.

10:11.257 --> 10:14.479
Uncle,
someone has arrived!

10:15.354 --> 10:16.605
He has a white cat!

10:16.606 --> 10:19.102
Another victim
of the North Men no doubt.

10:19.103 --> 10:21.478
Now, let's see.

10:32.222 --> 10:34.385
<i>[crowd talking]</i>

10:34.386 --> 10:39.654
Oh, no, no... not that far. But we've legs
walked ourselves all the way.

10:39.655 --> 10:43.418
But please, from where?
A very long way?

10:43.419 --> 10:45.967
Oh yes, it was long enough alright.

10:45.968 --> 10:50.655
but when you just want to keep up with,
the road just takes half the time.

10:50.656 --> 10:53.451
Isn't that right Pangur Ban?

10:53.572 --> 10:57.579
- We really can't stay very long.
- Welcome to Kells, brother.

10:57.580 --> 10:59.432
- Abbot Cellach
- Peace be with you!

10:59.433 --> 11:04.300
Brothers, welcome to Kells one of
the great illuminators of our times.

11:04.301 --> 11:06.462
Must be a mistake.

11:06.463 --> 11:09.306
Brother Aidan of lona.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.623
One question at a time.

11:15.624 --> 11:17.624
As Columb Kil used to say:

11:17.625 --> 11:22.374
"Questions do not burn your tongue
if you wait to ask them".

11:22.657 --> 11:24.297
Welcome to Kells, brother Aidan!

11:24.298 --> 11:27.707
Just this way, brother.

11:33.558 --> 11:37.143
Hello! Welcome to Kells!

11:37.144 --> 11:39.208
Hey, wait!

11:41.831 --> 11:46.169
<i>just talking of you
and of the book.</i>

11:49.178 --> 11:52.447
Fine size of a place, isn't it?

11:52.493 --> 11:55.572
Good clean air, bright light
coming from those windows...

11:55.573 --> 11:57.500
Brother!

11:57.575 --> 12:00.370
Is that where you keep the book?

12:02.433 --> 12:06.937
Is... that where...
you keep... the..

12:06.938 --> 12:11.425
And who might you be?
A very short brother I see.

12:11.649 --> 12:15.658
Although short of stature
is never as short of questions.

12:15.659 --> 12:18.855
And of what interest
is the book to you?

12:18.856 --> 12:21.487
Well...
the brothers where talking,

12:21.488 --> 12:24.421
and they said
that Saint Columb Kil himself began s...

12:24.422 --> 12:27.264
Brothers, the brother of Aidan
must come with me...

12:27.265 --> 12:29.212
I must take him to see
the important work we are doing...

12:29.213 --> 12:33.411
to fortify Kells.
You all have work to do.

12:35.272 --> 12:37.027
The plans are in my work room.

12:37.028 --> 12:39.122
Ah see, I was thinking,
I could stay here...

12:39.123 --> 12:40.872
- and...
- Right this way, brother.

12:42.294 --> 12:43.845
- Lad!
- Hmm...?

12:43.846 --> 12:45.090
Find some food for a...

12:45.091 --> 12:48.768
You see, I am determined to complete
the fortifications within two years.

12:48.769 --> 12:52.377
So, you're Pangur Ban.
Well I'm Bre...

12:52.378 --> 12:55.660
Hey! Wait!
I'm supposed to feed you...

12:55.661 --> 12:57.371
Wait!

12:59.161 --> 13:01.039
Pangur Ban!

13:03.599 --> 13:05.581
Pangur Ban!

13:05.661 --> 13:08.515
You shouldn't have come here.
The North Men will have followed...

13:08.516 --> 13:10.833
"Did I have to stay,
to be killed?

13:10.834 --> 13:14.892
I escaped the Vikings and left them
far behind, Brother Cellach...

13:14.893 --> 13:18.108
Sorry, I mean...
Abbot Cellach.

13:18.109 --> 13:21.986
The book is saved,
and I need to completed.

13:23.652 --> 13:27.281
Yes, well... we have more
pressing things to complete here.

13:27.282 --> 13:30.814
- You mean your wall?
- Not my wall, Aidan!

13:30.815 --> 13:33.514
A wall to save civilization.

13:33.515 --> 13:36.225
A wall to save your book!

13:37.509 --> 13:39.162
Pagens...

13:39.163 --> 13:41.210
Crom worshipers...

13:41.661 --> 13:44.076
It is with the strenght of our walls,

13:44.077 --> 13:48.213
that they will come to trust
the strenght of our faith.

13:48.316 --> 13:51.859
You were always good
at the old drawing, Cellach.

13:51.860 --> 13:57.180
Yes, well if you'd excuse me...
I have a lot to attend to.

13:58.633 --> 14:01.224
No wall can stop the North Men, Abbot.

14:01.225 --> 14:04.096
When they come,
all we can do is run...

14:04.097 --> 14:07.415
and hope
that we are fast enough.

14:13.423 --> 14:15.653
Come on Pangur.

14:49.666 --> 14:51.316
Pangur!

14:51.772 --> 14:54.030
I don't mean the book any harm.

14:54.031 --> 14:57.123
All I've ever seen
is inside the walls of Kells.

14:57.124 --> 14:59.972
If I could just see one page

14:59.973 --> 15:01.731
Please.

15:08.026 --> 15:09.349
Well!

15:09.350 --> 15:12.223
If it isn't the little brother
with the big questions?

15:12.224 --> 15:14.459
- I didn't mean to...
- I understand.

15:14.460 --> 15:18.966
You got bored eavesdropping
on the Abbot's private conversation...

15:18.967 --> 15:20.766
and decided to rummed
through my things.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.550
Oh, no, that's not it!

15:22.551 --> 15:26.011
Calm down lad, calm down,
I won't tell on ya.

15:27.086 --> 15:28.926
Maybe I...

15:28.967 --> 15:33.166
The brothers say that sinners are blinded
if they glanced at the book.

15:33.167 --> 15:34.647
So, maybe I shouldn't...

15:34.648 --> 15:38.527
Is that what you really believe
what happened?

15:38.528 --> 15:42.167
There's nothing in this life but mist,
is there lad?

15:42.168 --> 15:45.298
It's your decision,
no one else's.

15:53.663 --> 15:58.473
The cover, is not the real treasure.
Open it!

16:02.489 --> 16:04.922
The work of angels.

16:06.408 --> 16:11.406
"The work of the angels"
Did you hear that, Pangur?

16:11.509 --> 16:14.682
I didn't know that angels
would be as funny looking as me.

16:14.683 --> 16:18.168
Maybe it's the boy
has gone blind.

16:18.169 --> 16:21.499
I thought the very same,
when I first saw it.

16:21.500 --> 16:27.187
But it is only the work of mere mortals,
I'm afraid, like me or you.

16:27.188 --> 16:31.857
The book is a beacon
in these dark days of the North Men.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.785
Do you want to see
the most beautiful page?

16:34.786 --> 16:39.201
The one that will turn
darnkess into light?

16:42.670 --> 16:47.411
It is to be,
the "Chi Ro" page.

16:49.582 --> 16:51.670
But it hasn't been made yet.

16:51.671 --> 16:56.000
No, but it will become the most
glorious page of the entire book.

16:56.001 --> 16:58.670
Tell me Brendan,
would you like to help?

16:58.671 --> 17:01.963
Oh yes, please! I help the brothers
find quills all the time.

17:01.964 --> 17:04.161
Calm down,
calm down, little brother.

17:04.162 --> 17:09.701
Now to start with, you can help me gather
some of these, from an old oak tree.

17:09.702 --> 17:11.103
What is this?

17:11.104 --> 17:12.702
It's a humble little berry,

17:12.703 --> 17:16.502
but it makes the deepest
emerald green ink you'll ever see.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.853
If you help me get
a dozen or so from the forest...

17:19.854 --> 17:23.193
I'll show you how to make it,
so, come on!

17:26.672 --> 17:28.240
What's keeping you?

17:28.241 --> 17:32.334
I can't go. I'm not allowed
to go outside the wall.

17:32.335 --> 17:34.476
It's too dangerous.

17:34.477 --> 17:37.896
It is, dangerous.

17:38.033 --> 17:40.274
lona

17:40.275 --> 17:44.361
I lost my brothers to attackers
from the outside.

17:44.362 --> 17:48.034
Now I have only the book
to remember them by.

17:48.035 --> 17:51.985
But... if my brothers
where here now...

17:51.986 --> 17:55.385
they would tell you
you'll learn more in the woods...

17:55.386 --> 17:58.002
from trees and rocks
than from any other place.

17:58.003 --> 18:00.622
You'll see miracles.

18:00.623 --> 18:05.010
And that is something
the Abbot knew... a long time ago.

18:13.673 --> 18:17.673
I've never
seen anything like it, Pangur.

18:17.674 --> 18:21.517
I really want to help
brother Aidan.

18:21.518 --> 18:26.293
I think I could get those ink berries all
by my self. I could go into the forest...

18:26.294 --> 18:29.250
wouldn't brother Aidan
be surprised.

18:29.851 --> 18:30.897
Ahh...

18:30.898 --> 18:32.830
but the Abbot...

18:32.845 --> 18:35.404
I'll be back
before he'd even missed me.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.929
But...
What if I get lost...

18:37.930 --> 18:39.098
in the dark?

18:39.099 --> 18:43.087
No!
I should never go out there!

18:44.365 --> 18:49.875
if I keep thinking
of the book

18:50.207 --> 18:53.013
I won't be afraid of the dark.

18:53.014 --> 18:56.136
And I'm sure I won't have to go that far.

18:56.137 --> 19:01.845
Alright so, Pangur Ban.
Tomorrow I'll go into the forest!

19:19.586 --> 19:21.390
Pangur!

20:40.537 --> 20:46.717
Ofcourse, it might help if I knew what
an oak tree looked like.

21:03.308 --> 21:07.483
Maybe we'd better go home...

21:08.681 --> 21:12.743
Was it this way? Do you remember?

21:14.697 --> 21:21.248
Don't panic, Pangur. We just have
to find the way back before dark.

22:32.514 --> 22:35.813
Ow no, it's hard enough...

22:35.814 --> 22:38.134
Is this your cat?

22:43.413 --> 22:44.644
Well?

22:44.645 --> 22:48.406
I've heard about creatures like you

22:48.407 --> 22:51.195
You're a fairy!

22:51.682 --> 22:57.685
What are you doing in my forest?
You've come to spoil it, haven't you?

22:57.686 --> 23:04.236
You were probably sent here
by your family, to get food, weren't you?

23:04.328 --> 23:07.640
Well, you can go right back
where you came from.

23:07.641 --> 23:11.211
If you don't,
I'll make the wolves get you!

23:11.212 --> 23:12.727
No!

23:13.902 --> 23:17.526
I didn't mean to...
Look, I'm sorry alright?

23:17.527 --> 23:20.971
I'm not here to get food for my family.
I'm here to get things to make ink.

23:20.972 --> 23:24.363
I don't have a family, and we
have food in Kells.

23:24.364 --> 23:27.720
So I wouldn't come here for it anyway.
I was just a bit lost.

23:27.721 --> 23:30.516
You have no family?

23:30.517 --> 23:32.105
No.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.656
No mother?

23:35.986 --> 23:40.037
I'm alone too.

23:41.443 --> 23:44.527
If this is your forest, you must
know everything about it.

23:44.528 --> 23:45.667
Well, of course.

23:45.668 --> 23:46.961
No Wait!

23:46.962 --> 23:48.736
Hello?

23:49.107 --> 23:52.522
Shhh... not so loud!
Go away!

23:52.688 --> 23:56.430
No wait Please! Do you know where
you can find these?

23:56.431 --> 23:58.142
Yes

23:58.143 --> 23:59.762
But you can't eat those.

23:59.763 --> 24:04.418
I don't want to eat them, they're for ink.

24:06.175 --> 24:08.214
What is ink?

24:08.215 --> 24:10.876
It's for the book...

24:10.877 --> 24:12.403
For make pictures.

24:12.404 --> 24:15.861
Liquid colour, you put it on pages...

24:15.862 --> 24:19.983
like leaves... it's hard to explain,
I suppose you'd have to see it.

24:19.984 --> 24:24.070
I do not know what you're talking about,
and I don't want to know...

24:24.071 --> 24:25.391
But.. brother Aidan...

24:25.392 --> 24:29.869
I will help you find the things you want,
on one condition...

24:29.998 --> 24:36.549
You and your pet must promise
to never come into my forest again.

24:41.690 --> 24:44.103
Alright then. We promise.

24:44.104 --> 24:48.374
Come on then,
I'll ask the forest where they are.

24:48.541 --> 24:51.194
Ask the... what...?

24:51.195 --> 24:52.969
Hey, wait!

24:52.970 --> 24:56.866
My name is Brendan. What's yours?

25:05.691 --> 25:09.790
It's a miracle, just like Aidan said.

25:09.791 --> 25:10.991
Aidan is my friend.

25:10.992 --> 25:15.417
I'm helping him make the most incredible
book in the whole world.

25:15.418 --> 25:20.611
He sais it'll turn darkness into light.
Wait until you see it!

25:20.612 --> 25:26.557
Wait until you see the rest of my forest!

25:37.892 --> 25:39.007
You're fast.

25:39.008 --> 25:42.586
Yes, I'm the fastest.

25:42.587 --> 25:44.036
So...

25:44.037 --> 25:46.737
Where are the berries then?

25:51.693 --> 25:54.782
You have climbed a tree before,
haven't you?

25:55.593 --> 25:58.769
Yes, of course. It's easy.

25:59.674 --> 26:01.546
Come on so!

26:30.894 --> 26:33.821
Saved your life, second time today.

26:33.822 --> 26:36.944
I thought you knew how to climb trees.

26:36.945 --> 26:39.192
I do. Smaller ones.

26:39.193 --> 26:42.138
Yeah... like bushes.

26:42.982 --> 26:45.652
Don't look down. Come on!

26:51.695 --> 26:53.350
Look!

26:56.620 --> 27:00.175
One beatle recognizes another.

27:26.546 --> 27:28.112
Come on!

27:28.577 --> 27:33.612
Open your eyes and I'll tell you my name.

27:35.497 --> 27:37.393
Aisling.

27:39.287 --> 27:43.817
and this, is my forest.

27:53.969 --> 27:56.572
I asked them not to sting you.

27:56.573 --> 27:58.802
Here's what you're looking for...

27:58.803 --> 28:02.122
but they're not really berries.

28:02.123 --> 28:04.230
They look like boar droppings.

28:04.231 --> 28:06.655
They're kind of stinky too.

28:09.499 --> 28:13.530
If you're finished,
It's time to go back down.

28:14.599 --> 28:16.731
back down...

28:17.149 --> 28:18.898
A bit left.

28:18.899 --> 28:21.898
No wait! Don't lean on that...

28:21.899 --> 28:23.735
branch.

28:25.452 --> 28:28.528
I'm sorry it took so long to come down.

28:28.529 --> 28:30.371
Except for the last part...

28:30.372 --> 28:34.499
We'd better go now.
I know a secret way to get you home

28:34.500 --> 28:36.211
Come on!

28:43.708 --> 28:45.880
Look!

28:47.608 --> 28:49.550
Brendan?

29:04.757 --> 29:07.837
What are you doing? Come away!

29:09.319 --> 29:11.854
This is a place of suffering.

29:11.855 --> 29:14.290
Suffering? What do you mean?

29:14.291 --> 29:17.834
Just come away! It's too dangerous.

29:17.835 --> 29:21.067
Surely it can't be more dangerous
than climbing an oak tree.

29:21.068 --> 29:23.936
It is the cave of the Dark One.

29:23.937 --> 29:25.414
Crom Cruach?

29:25.415 --> 29:28.836
But Crom Cruach's
only a story for children.

29:28.837 --> 29:32.715
The Abbot of Kells, says you shouldn't
be afraid of imaginary things.

29:32.716 --> 29:35.635
It's not imagined.

29:36.073 --> 29:41.001
It's waiting in the darkness.
Waiting for someone to awaken it.

29:41.002 --> 29:43.622
Aisling, you're only scaring yourself.

29:43.623 --> 29:46.280
The abbot sais that that's all pagan
nonesense.

29:46.281 --> 29:49.327
There's no such thing as Crom Cruach...

29:52.916 --> 29:55.242
Don't... speak it's name!

29:55.243 --> 29:58.051
You're really frightened?

30:11.798 --> 30:13.525
Aisling!

30:18.132 --> 30:20.112
Are you hurt?

30:22.857 --> 30:24.656
What was that?

30:24.657 --> 30:26.284
I told you...

30:26.285 --> 30:27.897
Crom!

30:35.706 --> 30:37.904
- Brendan?
- Huh?

30:37.905 --> 30:41.283
You can visit the forest again,
if you like.

30:41.405 --> 30:44.012
And Pangur can come too.

30:54.811 --> 30:58.220
- But sir, on lona we always arange them~
- This is not lona.

30:58.221 --> 31:01.224
The scriptorium will be arranged
according to my instructions.

31:01.225 --> 31:03.845
But this is not good...

31:04.106 --> 31:07.186
It will be as I say.

31:07.279 --> 31:10.485
Brother Aidan! I found them! I...

31:10.486 --> 31:14.297
Well, Brendan.
It's about time we saw you today.

31:16.606 --> 31:18.351
Where have you been?

31:28.307 --> 31:31.432
I'm listening. Where were you?

31:31.607 --> 31:33.179
I...

31:33.180 --> 31:34.802
I went into the forest.

31:34.803 --> 31:38.888
Just for a little while, not very long.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.256
Just... It was for Brother Aidan...

31:40.257 --> 31:45.211
Brendan. Have I not warned enough
about what lies beyond these walls?

31:45.212 --> 31:46.304
Yet you disobey me.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.327
I know, but for the book...

31:47.328 --> 31:52.406
Brendan. You are never to leave
the abbey again without my permission.

31:52.407 --> 31:53.743
Uncle, if you see the book...

31:53.744 --> 31:58.097
Do you Understand?

31:58.098 --> 31:59.432
Good.

31:59.433 --> 32:05.038
Now come along, there are matters
to attend to in the workroom.

32:47.510 --> 32:49.735
- Look!
- What?

32:49.736 --> 32:52.972
- I found them.
- You did? So you did!

32:52.973 --> 32:54.938
I did have a little help.

32:54.939 --> 32:57.734
From a friend in the forest.

32:58.641 --> 33:01.915
There's nothing you can't do
when you have friends to help you, right?

33:01.916 --> 33:03.510
Now, let's see.

33:03.511 --> 33:07.519
Yes, yes... I believe
these will do very nicely...

33:07.520 --> 33:11.459
From tiny berries
do great images come to life...

33:11.460 --> 33:13.010
Come along!

33:39.334 --> 33:42.108
Lot of smoke... that's a good sign.

33:42.109 --> 33:44.647
- It is?
- Yes.

33:46.212 --> 33:49.281
- Ah, beautiful.
- From a stinky berry.

33:49.282 --> 33:52.283
Making ink is all very well,
but it is useless...

33:52.284 --> 33:54.298
without one of these.

33:54.299 --> 33:55.598
I'm not... I'm not allowed to...

33:55.599 --> 33:58.313
There's no one else here now.

33:58.314 --> 34:00.398
Just you

34:00.399 --> 34:02.743
and your imagination.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.233
Afraid?

34:08.234 --> 34:13.458
Me? No. I'm not afraid
of imaginary things.

34:17.179 --> 34:21.449
Keep going! Finish what you start.

34:45.385 --> 34:47.065
Gold!

35:29.747 --> 35:31.732
Not bad.

35:31.939 --> 35:34.416
I'd say he could do it right enough.

35:34.417 --> 35:35.796
Do what?

35:35.797 --> 35:38.636
I must confess my boy.

35:38.637 --> 35:42.166
I haven't been completely honest with you.

35:42.167 --> 35:46.017
I can not do the Chi-ro page.

35:46.018 --> 35:49.833
My eyes have become too old.
And my hands unsteady.

35:49.834 --> 35:51.354
But .. you said...

35:51.355 --> 35:53.785
You should be the one to do that page!

35:53.786 --> 35:55.766
Me? No! I can never...

35:55.767 --> 35:57.678
there must be somebody else...

35:57.679 --> 36:00.617
You have to do it.
I would ruin it.

36:00.618 --> 36:02.651
No, no, no. Ofcourse you can do it.

36:02.652 --> 36:04.617
You found those berries

36:04.618 --> 36:07.225
You've certainly developed a steady hand.

36:07.718 --> 36:11.942
Even before I came you'd already learned
much from the other brothers's work.

36:11.943 --> 36:14.209
You've only to unleash your imagination!

36:14.210 --> 36:16.015
I have go.

36:24.026 --> 36:26.218
Where have you been so early?

36:26.219 --> 36:29.349
Come along, there is much work to be done.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.668
I don't know Pangur...

36:34.669 --> 36:39.255
Something I cannot see, stops him.

36:41.720 --> 36:46.087
If he is ever to light up
the Chi-ro page...

36:46.088 --> 36:52.638
he'll have to turn around and stare
whatever it is, in the face!

37:12.021 --> 37:13.220
Brendan!

37:13.221 --> 37:19.111
We're moving the scaffolding to
the west wall. Hurry along now!

38:28.853 --> 38:33.913
I think you're ready
to learn Columb Kil's secret.

38:33.914 --> 38:36.173
The mesmerizing detail...

38:36.174 --> 38:38.995
Of course,
you need another eye.

38:38.996 --> 38:40.537
Now...

38:41.891 --> 38:44.516
- Once I find the crystal...
- Brother...

38:44.517 --> 38:47.377
open up a whole new world...
a tiny wonder...

38:47.378 --> 38:50.964
Columb Kil instructed that the crystal
should never be used,

38:50.965 --> 38:53.464
for less than work
that's worthy of it.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.355
It has not been used
since lona.

38:55.356 --> 38:57.177
What's... a crystal?

38:57.178 --> 39:01.464
This's not a crystal, it's The Crystal!

39:01.465 --> 39:04.241
The eye of Columb Kil.

39:04.242 --> 39:08.727
Columb Kil created over
300 books in his lifetime.

39:08.728 --> 39:10.758
By his own hands!

39:10.846 --> 39:13.784
On his deathbed,
he prayed that his apprentice

39:13.785 --> 39:16.625
got a vision as clear and wonderful
as his own.

39:16.626 --> 39:19.625
then as he drew his last last breath...

39:19.626 --> 39:21.702
it dropped from his hand...

39:21.703 --> 39:24.061
the eye of Colomb Kil!

39:24.062 --> 39:28.195
Colomb Kil would want it to go to you.

39:28.196 --> 39:29.197
Where is it?

39:29.198 --> 39:30.475
Sorry, Pangur.

39:30.476 --> 39:32.557
Have you seen it?

39:34.809 --> 39:36.452
It's lost.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.626
It's all lost!

39:38.627 --> 39:41.372
Where did you last have it?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.661
I don't understand.

39:54.662 --> 39:57.627
If I could show
the crystal to you...

39:57.628 --> 40:00.127
all would become clear.

40:00.128 --> 40:03.165
- But...
- But I can still continue my training,

40:03.166 --> 40:04.145
can't I?

40:04.146 --> 40:07.483
Have you ever studied the tiny pattern,
on a green fly's wing?

40:07.484 --> 40:08.627
No.

40:08.628 --> 40:11.227
And you'll never will
without the crystal.

40:11.228 --> 40:13.832
What if we pray for a miracle?

40:13.833 --> 40:15.749
Like Colomb Kil did?

40:15.750 --> 40:21.676
Some say, that before the crystal
became known, as the eye of Columb Kil

40:21.677 --> 40:23.328
it had an ancient name...

40:23.329 --> 40:27.187
Named from the creature that
Colomb Kil won the crystal from.

40:27.188 --> 40:30.199
Deep... inside
one of it's dweling places.

40:30.979 --> 40:32.118
Crom Cruach!

40:32.119 --> 40:36.009
It was called the eye of "Crom Cruach"

40:36.349 --> 40:39.805
I can't tell you which parts of this story
are true and what parts...

40:39.806 --> 40:42.026
are shrouded by the mists.

40:43.903 --> 40:47.108
Ah, there's nothing in this life
but mist...

40:47.109 --> 40:52.099
We're only here for a short while...

41:08.731 --> 41:10.530
Don't worry, Pangur.

41:10.531 --> 41:13.086
I won't be long.

41:27.011 --> 41:29.891
You've been forbidden to leave the abbey.

41:29.892 --> 41:32.738
Now you are also forbidden to enter the
scriptorium.

41:32.739 --> 41:34.566
Please, Uncle, you don't understand.

41:34.567 --> 41:37.315
Oh I understand perfectly well!

41:37.316 --> 41:39.023
No more escorsions.

41:39.024 --> 41:43.427
No more scriptorium
and no more brother Aidan.

41:43.428 --> 41:45.476
No.

41:47.363 --> 41:49.388
What did you say?

41:49.389 --> 41:51.533
I can't do that.

41:51.587 --> 41:53.923
I can't give up the book uncle

41:53.924 --> 41:56.261
If you looked at just one page and
see why.

41:56.262 --> 41:58.532
You've forgotten how important it is

41:58.533 --> 42:00.689
All you want from us is this wall.

42:00.690 --> 42:03.744
Brother Aidan said
you were an Illuminator once.

42:03.745 --> 42:06.595
- He said...
- That's enough!

42:09.533 --> 42:12.183
If I can't trust you
to stay out of harm's way...

42:12.184 --> 42:15.683
you'll have to remain here,
untill you'll see sense.

42:32.266 --> 42:36.321
Cellach, please, don't blame the boy.
I'll have a talk with to him and...

42:36.322 --> 42:39.016
- You do no such thing.
- You can't...

42:39.017 --> 42:41.023
Brother Tang
will bring him his meals...

42:41.024 --> 42:43.923
and once there is nothing left here
to distract him...

42:43.924 --> 42:46.686
Let me keep the book Cellach.

42:46.687 --> 42:48.845
It was entrusted to me.

42:49.395 --> 42:51.436
Allright then.

42:52.261 --> 42:58.211
But on the condition that you leave Kells
with the first thaw of spring.

43:45.649 --> 43:48.685
<i>Brendan...</i>

43:53.318 --> 43:55.162
Aisling!

44:01.058 --> 44:03.150
How can I get you out?

44:03.151 --> 44:04.888
I don't know.

44:05.341 --> 44:07.195
The tower is locked.

44:07.196 --> 44:10.225
And my door is bolted from the outside.

44:10.226 --> 44:14.071
The key is in the abbot's room.

44:14.197 --> 44:19.752
Maybe... you can take a message
to brother Aidan.

44:42.800 --> 44:49.351
You must go where I can not...

44:51.779 --> 44:55.321
Pangur Ban...

46:15.390 --> 46:17.521
Why did the abbot put you in there?

46:17.522 --> 46:19.618
Because I disobeyed him .

46:19.619 --> 46:21.134
Why?

46:21.192 --> 46:23.156
Look!

46:23.157 --> 46:26.543
- The Eye of Crom!
- No, it's a crystal.

46:26.544 --> 46:28.998
I think there's one
in the Dark One's cave.

46:28.999 --> 46:31.106
I have to go there.

46:31.107 --> 46:36.283
No Brendan, it's tricking you.
You should have stayed in your tower.

46:36.284 --> 46:40.371
Crom Cruach took my people,
it took my mother.

46:40.372 --> 46:44.156
It takes everything. You will die!

46:44.157 --> 46:50.708
Aisling, if I don't try, the book
will never be complete.

46:55.256 --> 46:57.864
The book...

46:58.588 --> 47:02.095
Alright then, I will help you.

47:30.656 --> 47:35.246
Aisling! This place is hurting you,
you must go back.

47:35.247 --> 47:37.240
I'll find someother way.

47:37.241 --> 47:41.330
I.. I must help you...

47:50.878 --> 47:53.341
Please hurry, go now!

47:53.342 --> 47:57.657
Turn the darkness into light.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.750
Aisling!

50:32.061 --> 50:34.544
Aisling!

50:55.055 --> 50:57.964
Old fools!

50:57.965 --> 51:00.412
Old fools should learn to keep quite...

51:00.413 --> 51:03.687
unless young fools want to listen...

51:03.688 --> 51:07.033
Ha! You're here! How... How did you...?

51:07.034 --> 51:09.100
How did you get out of the tower?

51:09.101 --> 51:11.588
You must go back
before the abbot finds out.

51:11.589 --> 51:15.927
This is not the place for you lad,
there is nothing for you here.

51:15.928 --> 51:18.564
But you're here, the book is here...

51:18.565 --> 51:21.607
and the eye is here.

51:31.091 --> 51:34.630
How is this possible?!
It was destroyed!

51:34.631 --> 51:37.218
There is more than one story
about the eye.

51:37.219 --> 51:40.062
There is more than one dwelling place
for the Dark One...

51:40.063 --> 51:43.388
and he had more than one eye.

51:43.935 --> 51:47.522
You... you entered one
of the Dark One's caves?

51:47.523 --> 51:51.556
You can find out everything
from books you know.

51:51.557 --> 51:54.256
I think I read that once...

51:54.257 --> 51:58.053
Right then... it is time to begin!

52:27.600 --> 52:30.118
Your breakfast, abbot.

52:30.119 --> 52:32.969
Take it to Brendan.

52:33.359 --> 52:34.958
See if...

52:34.959 --> 52:39.804
See if he has come to his senses.

55:09.916 --> 55:12.584
It's like heaven, no?

55:12.585 --> 55:15.735
Heaven on Earth.

55:16.465 --> 55:19.975
Please... please abbot, it's my fault.

55:21.728 --> 55:22.965
Little fool!

55:22.966 --> 55:28.856
The North Men are upon us
and here you are... drawing!

55:29.702 --> 55:32.265
We have one day before the Vikings
attack Kells!

55:32.266 --> 55:34.760
- The gate won't hold.
- We must run from here!

55:34.761 --> 55:38.255
The gate will hold! You will lead
the refugees into the chapel.

55:38.256 --> 55:41.656
They will seek comfort there
untill the attackers move on.

55:41.657 --> 55:44.989
Tang! Tell villagers
to stay in their house.

55:44.990 --> 55:47.209
Cellach!

55:47.602 --> 55:53.827
You'll be safe in here
with your precious book.

57:06.570 --> 57:10.087
No, not yet!

57:12.890 --> 57:15.442
Stay inside!

57:44.191 --> 57:47.480
Tang! Open the door!

57:47.782 --> 57:50.478
Into the tower!

58:00.572 --> 58:05.752
One at a time!
The steps aren't strong enough!

58:05.829 --> 58:08.806
Tang, there are too many!

58:11.071 --> 58:13.673
It's too late.

58:24.254 --> 58:26.871
Close the door!

58:31.808 --> 58:34.109
Brendan!

59:15.320 --> 59:17.574
Ink! We have to make ink!

59:17.575 --> 59:21.700
- Brendan! Wait... we can't...
- Hurry!

59:45.276 --> 59:47.125
Uncle!

59:48.577 --> 59:50.898
No!

59:51.577 --> 59:53.611
No! We must save him!

59:53.612 --> 59:56.611
Quickly Brendan, where is the
secret passage to the forest?

59:56.612 --> 59:58.228
We have to save him!

59:58.229 --> 01:00:01.594
We can't help him now.

01:00:04.753 --> 01:00:07.639
Brendan!

01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:52.039
We... We cannot stop.

01:00:53.079 --> 01:00:54.620
I have to go back.

01:00:54.621 --> 01:00:59.278
The North Men left no one on lona,
they will leave no one on Kells

01:00:59.279 --> 01:01:02.338
- My uncle...
- He lived to protect you.

01:01:02.339 --> 01:01:05.362
The only way he knew how...

01:01:05.363 --> 01:01:08.351
Now I must protect you

01:01:08.352 --> 01:01:12.354
for Cellach and for the book.

01:01:13.823 --> 01:01:16.820
Gold!

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.030
Brendan!

01:02:46.307 --> 01:02:48.944
Aisling!

01:02:55.058 --> 01:03:01.608
We have to keep running, Brendan,
and hope that we're fast enough.

01:03:19.083 --> 01:03:21.573
He's alive!

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:29.136
I'm so tired.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.532
Tang, leave me be.

01:03:34.668 --> 01:03:36.244
Please...

01:03:36.686 --> 01:03:38.558
Leave me be...

01:03:44.117 --> 01:03:47.136
You are the abbot of Kells!

01:03:47.686 --> 01:03:49.956
You must get up!

01:05:24.175 --> 01:05:27.806
The book was never meant
to be hidden away behind walls...

01:05:27.807 --> 01:05:32.013
locked away from the world
which inspired its creation.

01:05:32.014 --> 01:05:33.564
Brendan,

01:05:33.743 --> 01:05:36.211
You must take the book to the people

01:05:36.212 --> 01:05:38.840
So that they may have hope...

01:05:38.841 --> 01:05:45.391
let it light the way in these dark days
of the North Men.

01:06:22.483 --> 01:06:24.442
Aisling?

01:06:40.677 --> 01:06:43.277
I'm so tired.

01:06:43.278 --> 01:06:45.807
Please, abbot, you must take your rest.

01:06:45.808 --> 01:06:50.858
Rest? With our most important
treasure destroyed?!

01:06:50.859 --> 01:06:52.693
But how was I to know?

01:06:52.694 --> 01:06:55.231
How could I know he would perish?

01:06:55.232 --> 01:06:57.600
Please, abbot.

01:07:02.334 --> 01:07:06.051
He was only a boy...

01:07:15.295 --> 01:07:19.714
Angel of Darkness! Not yet!

01:07:19.715 --> 01:07:24.616
I need time!

01:07:40.596 --> 01:07:43.047
Uncle!

01:07:45.336 --> 01:07:48.136
Brendan?

01:07:51.115 --> 01:07:53.722
It is a dream...

01:07:55.006 --> 01:07:57.386
This is no dream.

01:07:57.697 --> 01:08:00.596
I'm so happy to find you here.

01:08:00.597 --> 01:08:04.120
I thought I'd lost you a long ago.

01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:06.051
Brendan!

01:08:06.427 --> 01:08:08.930
You were only a boy...

01:08:08.931 --> 01:08:11.646
All those innocents... lost.

01:08:11.647 --> 01:08:14.611
- All my fault...
- Please, uncle...

01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:16.308
Do not distress yourself.

01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:18.395
You don't understand.

01:08:18.397 --> 01:08:20.671
I have no time, Brendan.

01:08:20.671 --> 01:08:22.697
You were right...

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.586
About Kells...

01:08:24.587 --> 01:08:26.096
About Aidan...

01:08:26.098 --> 01:08:27.326
About the book...

01:08:27.327 --> 01:08:30.167
I shouldn't have...

01:08:30.247 --> 01:08:33.042
This is all I have left.

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:38.814
It is the only comfort
I have in this world.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.287
Brother Aidan was right...

01:08:41.287 --> 01:08:45.038
And I tried to stop him.

01:08:45.216 --> 01:08:49.582
Aidan never paid you much heed, uncle.

01:08:51.332 --> 01:08:53.502
I suppose not...

01:08:53.504 --> 01:09:00.054
Brother Aidan lived to see
his work passed on... and completed.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.819
The Book of lona!

01:09:15.821 --> 01:09:18.303
The Book of Kells...?

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.700
The Book of Kells.
