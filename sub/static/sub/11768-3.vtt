A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:54.367 --> 00:56.667
YOU KNOW, THE COWBOY HAT
WITH THAT BOLO STRING,

00:56.700 --> 00:58.133
WHAT IS THAT ?

00:58.167 --> 01:01.500
NOW, WAS THE BALL
CLOSER TO HIM OR TO YOU ?

01:01.533 --> 01:02.933
VERY GOOD QUESTION.

01:02.967 --> 01:04.067
THANK YOU.

01:04.067 --> 01:06.400
I THINK IT WAS, MAYBE,
A LITTLE CLOSER TO HIM.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.567
BUT, YOU COULDN'T
JUST BE POLITE,

01:08.600 --> 01:09.933
REACH DOWN
AND PICK UP THE BALL ?

01:09.967 --> 01:11.067
I COULD'VE.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.933
BUT THAT STRING...

01:12.967 --> 01:16.267
SAME HAT, NO STRING,
NO QUESTION.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.167
I PICK IT UP.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.733
I SEE CERTAIN ITEMS
AND I RECOIL IN HORROR.

01:21.767 --> 01:24.133
HEY, HOW'S JEFF ?

01:24.167 --> 01:27.067
OH, I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE
TO HAVE BYPASS SURGERY.

01:27.067 --> 01:28.800
REALLY ?

01:28.833 --> 01:30.233
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ?

01:30.267 --> 01:31.967
I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST
GOING IN FOR TESTS.

01:32.067 --> 01:33.767
WENT IN, THEY
WOULDN'T LET HIM OUT.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.100
THAT'S KIND
OF SCARY.

01:35.133 --> 01:37.133
I KNOW, BUT,
HE'LL BE FINE.

01:37.167 --> 01:40.400
WELL, TELL HIM I SAID HI
AND GIVE HIM MY BEST.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.367
YEAH, OKAY.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.067
AND JOHN DEBELLOS CALLED.

01:46.067 --> 01:48.633
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT
TO CALL HIM BACK.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.633
HELLO ?

02:02.667 --> 02:05.133
LARRY.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.067
OH, HOW ARE YOU, GIL ?

02:07.100 --> 02:08.833
YOU SOUNDED LIKE
MY FRIEND, JOHN.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.633
I JUST CALLED
TO SAY HELLO.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.300
SATURDAY NIGHT ?

02:20.067 --> 02:23.500
WELL, I NEED
DIRECTIONS.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.400
JUST FAX THEM.

02:25.433 --> 02:28.800
IT'S THE SAME
AS MY HOME NUMBER.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.233
ALRIGHT, VERY GOOD.

02:31.267 --> 02:33.433
BYE.

02:33.467 --> 02:36.100
DIRECTIONS
FOR WHAT ?

02:37.267 --> 02:40.267
I DIALED THE NUMBER
UNDER JOHN'S BY ACCIDENT.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.800
I GOT THIS GUY,
GIL THILANDER,

02:42.833 --> 02:44.267
AT THE GOLF CLUB.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.867
WHO'S GIL THILANDER ?

02:46.900 --> 02:49.100
I PLAYED GOLF WITH HIM,
LIKE, THREE TIMES.

02:49.133 --> 02:52.067
AND, HE INVITED US
TO THIS PARTY

02:52.067 --> 02:53.800
ON SATURDAY NIGHT
AT HIS HOUSE.

02:53.833 --> 02:56.133
WE WERE GONNA GO OUT
TO DINNER ON SATURDAY.

02:56.167 --> 02:58.067
WELL, I TOLD
HIM WE'D GO.

02:58.067 --> 03:00.133
WHO IS GIL ?

03:00.167 --> 03:03.100
HE USED TO BE A PORNO ACTOR,
LIKE, 15 YEARS AGO.

03:03.133 --> 03:05.700
NO, I DON'T WANNA
GO TO A PORN PARTY.

03:05.733 --> 03:08.500
IT'S NOT
A PORN PARTY.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.100
PLEASE !

03:10.133 --> 03:11.867
WE'RE NOT EVEN GONNA
SPEAK TO HIM ANYWAY.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.567
WE'LL GO IN,
IT'S A PARTY.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.067
WE'LL JUST SAY HELLO
AND THAT'LL BE IT.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.767
LISTEN, HERE'S
WHAT WE'LL DO.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.967
WE'LL GO OUT
TO DINNER

03:18.067 --> 03:19.333
AND, THEN WE'LL
STOP BY THE PARTY

03:19.367 --> 03:20.533
AND WE'LL BE OUTTA
THERE IN 10 MINUTES.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.400
WE'LL JUST SAY HELLO
AND THEN THAT'S IT,

03:22.433 --> 03:24.633
AND WE'LL LEAVE,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.267
SO, YOU GOT SOME
KIND OF BLOCKAGE ?

03:31.300 --> 03:32.367
BLOCKAGE.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.367
I WENT IN FOR NORMAL
TESTS AND HE SAID,

03:34.400 --> 03:35.900
"YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

03:35.933 --> 03:37.500
"AND, IF WE DON'T
GET THIS CLEANED OUT,

03:37.533 --> 03:39.800
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A HEART ATTACK."

03:39.833 --> 03:41.367
THAT'S PLEASANT NEWS.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.233
THAT'S NICE TO HEAR,
ISN'T IT ?

03:43.267 --> 03:44.933
YOU'VE GOTTA DO
ME A FAVOR, THOUGH.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.533
I'VE GOT TESTS ALL WEEK.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.467
SUNDAY, THEY'RE DOING
THE PROCEDURE, OKAY ?

03:48.500 --> 03:49.633
SUNDAY ?

03:49.667 --> 03:51.500
SUSIE WILL BE HERE
ALL DAY SUNDAY.

03:51.533 --> 03:53.333
SHE WILL NOT
BE LEAVING HERE.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.067
THE KEYS,
IN THE DRAWER THERE,
GRAB THE KEYS,

03:55.067 --> 03:56.933
I WANNA SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

03:56.967 --> 03:59.467
JUST TRUST ME
ON THIS FOR A SECOND,
GET THE KEYS.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.200
THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT
IN THE DRAWER THERE.

04:02.233 --> 04:03.633
YEAH, OKAY.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.400
THIS KEY
RIGHT HERE...

04:05.433 --> 04:06.400
MYSTERIOUS.

04:06.433 --> 04:07.433
VERY MYSTERIOUS.

04:07.467 --> 04:10.167
THIS KEY RIGHT HERE,
MY FRONT DOOR.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.667
I NEED YOU TO
GO INTO MY HOUSE,

04:12.700 --> 04:14.833
OKAY, GO UP
TO MY BEDROOM.

04:14.867 --> 04:16.333
TO THE LEFT OF TV,

04:16.367 --> 04:18.300
THERE'S A CABINET
BY THE BOOKCASE THERE.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.067
OPEN IT UP,
MOVE THE LINENS,

04:20.067 --> 04:21.733
THERE'S LINENS IN THERE,
MOVE 'EM TO THE SIDE,

04:21.767 --> 04:23.833
PUSH ON THE BACK DOOR,
AND IT'LL OPEN UP.

04:23.867 --> 04:26.267
INSIDE THERE, I HAVE,
LIKE, MY PORN COLLECTION.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.067
I HAVE, LIKE, SEVEN,
EIGHT PORN TAPES.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.367
A COUPLE OF
MAGAZINES, ALRIGHT ?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.300
I NEED YOU TO GET
THEM OUT OF THERE.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.367
YOU'VE GOTTA GET IT
OUT OF THERE,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.067
BECAUSE IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO ME...

04:37.067 --> 04:38.967
OH, YOU'RE THINKING,
LIKE, THE ANESTHESIA,

04:39.067 --> 04:40.333
SOMETHING
GOES WRONG.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.533
ANYTHING GOES WRONG,

04:41.567 --> 04:43.200
SHE'S NOT A
BIG PORN PERSON.

04:43.233 --> 04:45.133
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR WIFE
TO DISCOVER YOUR PORNO STUFF ?

04:45.167 --> 04:46.633
SHE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.067
I DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND IT EITHER.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.733
THAT'S YOUR
OWN DEAL,

04:50.767 --> 04:52.633
THAT'S YOUR OWN DEAL,
"REPRESSION JONES".

04:52.667 --> 04:54.867
WELL, IS THERE
AN ALARM CODE,

04:54.900 --> 04:56.600
OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT ?

04:56.633 --> 04:58.733
SY, 99-88.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.667
I BETTER
WRITE THAT DOWN.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.900
IN THERE, SHOULD BE
A PEN AND A PIECE OF PAPER.

05:06.067 --> 05:08.167
99-88, OKAY.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.900
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE
TO WRITE IT DOWN.

05:10.933 --> 05:13.467
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH THESE THINGS ?

05:13.500 --> 05:14.967
KEEP IT IN
YOUR TRUNK.

05:15.067 --> 05:16.967
WHAT IF I GET
IN AN ACCIDENT
ON THE WAY HOME,

05:17.067 --> 05:18.267
WHAT ABOUT THAT ?

05:18.300 --> 05:21.133
AND THE PORN GOES
FLYING EVERYWHERE ?

05:21.167 --> 05:22.767
STREWN ALL
OVER THE CAR.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.633
ALL OVER
MY BLEEDING BODY.

05:24.667 --> 05:25.900
YOU'LL BE FINE.
THIS ALARM CODE...

05:25.933 --> 05:27.467
NOTHING'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.100
I'M NO GOOD WITH
STUFF LIKE THAT.

05:29.133 --> 05:31.067
IT'S TOO
TECHNICAL FOR ME.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.533
99-88.

05:32.567 --> 05:33.933
THE ALARM'S
GONNA GO OFF,

05:33.967 --> 05:35.567
THEY'LL BE A SWAT TEAM
DESCENDING ON ME.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.067
THIS WHOLE THING
JUST HAS "DISASTER"
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.667
IT'LL BE FINE,
TRUST ME.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.633
AND YOUR WIFE
BETTER NOT SHOW UP.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.900
I GUARANTEE
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE THERE,
SHE'LL BE HERE.

05:43.933 --> 05:45.700
I APPRECIATE IT,
YOU'RE A GREAT PAL.

05:45.733 --> 05:47.467
GOOD LUCK,
TRY NOT TO DIE.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.267
"TRY NOT TO DIE."

05:50.300 --> 05:51.300
THANK YOU.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.067
SHIT.

05:58.633 --> 06:01.767
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU
GIVE DIRECTIONS LIKE THIS.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.633
I THOUGHT THIS PARTY
WAS IN L.A.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.333
I GUESS HE'S GOT
A WEEKEND HOUSE

06:07.367 --> 06:10.200
OR SOMETHING,
I DON'T KNOW.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.367
LARRY, WE'VE BEEN
DRIVING FOR AN HOUR.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.600
WE'RE, LIKE,
IN THE BOONDOCKS.

06:15.633 --> 06:17.967
WHY DON'T YOU USE YOUR
NAVIGATION SYSTEM THERE ?

06:18.067 --> 06:19.667
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO WORK IT.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.567
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO WORK IT ?

06:21.600 --> 06:22.667
NO.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.433
THEN WHY DID
YOU GET IT ?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.433
I DON'T KNOW, I WANTED
TO GET EVERYTHING.

06:26.467 --> 06:29.067
I WANTED TO HAVE
ALL THE LOADED THINGS.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.467
WHEN WERE YOU
GONNA LEARN ?

06:31.500 --> 06:34.067
I DON'T KNOW,
I THOUGHT SOMEBODY
WOULD TEACH ME.

06:34.067 --> 06:36.100
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL THEM AGAIN ?

06:36.133 --> 06:38.233
THEY'RE NOT
PICKING UP.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.767
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A PARTY.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.600
THEY PROBABLY DON'T
HEAR THE PHONE.

06:42.633 --> 06:46.067
WE LEFT THREE
MESSAGES ALREADY.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.500
ARE YOU EVEN READING
THOSE DIRECTIONS ?

06:48.533 --> 06:51.367
I'M LOOKING FOR
JAKE'S WAY.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.833
THAT'S ALL I'M DOING
IS LOOKING FOR JAKE'S WAY.

06:53.867 --> 06:55.600
YOU SHOULD
BE LOOKING, TOO.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.233
I HAVE
BEEN LOOKING.

06:57.267 --> 06:59.700
THESE DIRECTIONS ARE SHIT,
YOU KNOW THAT ?

07:00.933 --> 07:03.400
WELL, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
NOTHING OUT HERE.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.933
WAIT A SECOND,
IS THAT SOMEBODY ?

07:08.967 --> 07:10.600
DON'T PULL OVER.

07:10.633 --> 07:11.833
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

07:11.867 --> 07:14.067
WE'RE COMPLETELY
LOST HERE.

07:18.933 --> 07:21.467
EXCUSE ME, COULD
YOU HELP ME OUT HERE ?

07:21.500 --> 07:24.067
I'M TRYING TO GET
TO JAKE'S WAY.

07:24.067 --> 07:26.900
I WAS WONDERING
WHAT YOU WERE
DOING OUT HERE.

07:26.933 --> 07:29.200
YEAH, I THINK
I'M A LITTLE LOST.

07:29.233 --> 07:31.100
I MADE A LEFT
AT THE GAS STATION

07:31.133 --> 07:32.867
A COUPLE OF
MILES BACK.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.933
LET ME JUST TAKE A LOOK
AND I'LL STEER YOU...

07:35.967 --> 07:38.167
LET ME PUT
MY GLASSES ON.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.567
I CAN'T SEE A THING
WITHOUT MY GLASSES.

07:43.067 --> 07:46.567
NOW, "TAKE LAKESIDE...."

07:46.600 --> 07:48.933
YEAH, I KNOW,
I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.167
AND THEN I GOT
TO THE GAS STATION.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.467
I MADE A LEFT.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.067
WHO WROTE THIS ?

07:54.067 --> 07:55.567
A FRIEND OF MINE.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.967
IS HE A DOCTOR ?

07:57.067 --> 07:59.200
NO, I KNOW,
IT'S HARD TO READ.

07:59.233 --> 08:00.867
TERRIBLE
HANDWRITING.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.467
BUT, I CAN
MAKE IT OUT.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
YOU WERE AT
A GAS STATION ?

08:04.533 --> 08:06.133
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
IN THE GAS STATION

08:06.167 --> 08:07.733
AND SAY YOU
WERE LOST ?

08:07.767 --> 08:09.267
WELL, I WASN'T
LOST THEN.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.067
WELL, YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.633
IN MY BOOK,
THAT'S LOST.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.267
I WASN'T LOST 'CAUSE
I'M SUPPOSED TO

08:14.300 --> 08:16.467
MAKE A LEFT
AT THE GAS STATION.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.567
TAKE A L-F-T,
LEFT, LEFT,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.667
AT MILLER,
YOU'RE ON MILLER.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.167
SO, I WASN'T LOST
AT THE GAS STATION.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.833
YOU'RE ON MILLER.

08:24.867 --> 08:26.600
I KNOW, AND I'M LOOKING
FOR JAKE'S WAY.

08:26.633 --> 08:28.533
I DON'T KNOW IF I PASSED IT
OR IF IT'S UP AHEAD.

08:28.567 --> 08:29.733
JACK'S WAY ?

08:29.767 --> 08:31.533
NO, NO,
IT'S JAKE'S WAY.

08:31.567 --> 08:34.433
JAKE'S WAY,
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF JAKE'S WAY.

08:34.467 --> 08:36.367
THAT'S FINE,
I'LL JUST GET GOING.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.633
NO, IT'S ALRIGHT.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.667
LET'S SEE,
JAKE'S WAY.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.800
YOU'VE BEEN VERY
HELPFUL, THANK YOU.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.367
THANK YOU,
VERY MUCH.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.500
CAN I JUST HAVE
THE PAPER BACK, PLEASE ?

08:45.533 --> 08:48.300
PLEASE, DON'T GET
SO IMPATIENT, PLEASE.

08:48.333 --> 08:51.133
I'M GETTING A LOT
OF HOSTILITY FROM YOU,

08:51.167 --> 08:52.333
YOU KNOW.

08:52.367 --> 08:53.967
THERE'S A FEELING
OF ANGER.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.100
NO, THERE'S
NO HOSTILITY AT ALL,
THERE'S NO ANGER.

08:56.133 --> 08:57.633
CAN I JUST PLEASE
HAVE THE PAPER BACK ?

08:57.667 --> 08:58.733
PLEASE !

08:59.567 --> 09:01.333
YOU SNAP !

09:04.967 --> 09:07.433
AND I HOPE
YOU STAY LOST !

09:12.667 --> 09:14.933
WELL, THIS WAS
A WONDERFUL NIGHT.

09:14.967 --> 09:17.633
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO
DRIVE AROUND IN THIS AREA FOR,

09:17.667 --> 09:19.300
TWO, THREE HOURS.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.767
IT'S QUITE SCENIC,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.933
AND THEY HAVE SOME
VERY COLORFUL CHARACTERS.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.167
UH-HUH.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.233
I ENJOYED BABY JANE
A LOT, DIDN'T YOU ?

09:26.267 --> 09:28.233
I'D REALLY JUST LIKE
TO GO HOME, LARRY.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.667
I'M TRYING
TO GET US HOME.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.067
YOU'RE NOT
TRYING HARD ENOUGH.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.533
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.467
I DON'T HAVE
ANY DIRECTIONS.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.600
I THINK A GOOD IDEA
IS JUST TO KEEP DRIVING
AROUND AND AROUND.

09:37.633 --> 09:40.100
I'M LOOKING FOR THE HIGHWAY
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.

09:40.133 --> 09:41.767
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO ?

09:41.800 --> 09:43.467
WHAT IS THAT ?
IS THAT A CAR ?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.567
YEAH.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.867
HEY, I'M GONNA
STOP THIS CAR.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.133
I'M GONNA FLAG
THE CAR DOWN.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.467
BE CAREFUL.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.100
HI.
HEY.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.633
OH, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR STOPPING.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.300
MAN, OH, MAN,
I'VE BEEN SO LOST.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.167
I'VE BEEN DRIVING AROUND
FOR A HALF HOUR HERE.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.833
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET BACK TO

10:06.867 --> 10:08.867
TO THE FREEWAY
TO L.A.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.900
YOU DON'T
RECOGNIZE ME,
DO YOU ?

10:10.933 --> 10:12.067
NO.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.700
ON THE DRIVING RANGE
THE OTHER DAY ?

10:13.733 --> 10:15.467
YOU'RE THE GUY FROM
THE DRIVING RANGE.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.233
OH !

10:17.267 --> 10:19.167
I WAS RIGHT BEHIND YOU
ON THE RANGE.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.867
OH, RIGHT,
RIGHT, WOW !

10:20.900 --> 10:23.000
AND YOU WOULDN'T
HELP ME WITH THE BALL.

10:23.033 --> 10:24.800
THE BALL ?
THE RANGE BALL.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.800
IT FELL AND YOU WOULDN'T
HELP ME OUT WITH THE BALL.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.167
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
MY BACK WAS KILLING ME THAT DAY.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.433
I COULDN'T
BEND DOWN.

10:30.467 --> 10:32.967
OH, YOUR BACK...
I DIDN'T PICK UP ON THAT,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.633
'CAUSE YOU WERE
HITTING THE BALL SO WELL--

10:34.667 --> 10:36.033
THAT'S TWISTING.

10:36.067 --> 10:37.900
I COULD TWIST,
I COULDN'T BEND.

10:37.933 --> 10:39.933
OH, OKAY, RIGHT,
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.467
IT'S A BIG
DIFFERENCE, REALLY.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.033
OH, MY GOD,
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT

10:43.067 --> 10:44.533
I WAS SUCH
AN ASSHOLE.

10:44.567 --> 10:46.000
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHY

10:46.033 --> 10:47.500
YOU WOULDN'T HELP ME
WITH THE BALL.

10:47.533 --> 10:49.533
GOD, WHAT KIND OF PRICK DOESN'T
PICK UP SOMEBODY'S BALL ?

10:49.567 --> 10:52.233
I THOUGHT YOU COULD
HELP OUT A LITTLE BIT,
BUT, I UNDERSTAND.

10:52.267 --> 10:53.800
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I WOULD'VE PICKED UP
THE BALL IN A SECOND

10:53.833 --> 10:55.167
IF I COULD
BEND DOWN.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.733
IT'S YOUR BACK,
IT WAS YOUR BACK, RIGHT.

10:56.767 --> 10:57.967
COMPLETELY.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.367
SURE, NO,
I UNDERSTAND.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.833
I'M SORRY,
I APOLOGIZE.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.167
NO, IT'S OKAY,
IT'S ALRIGHT.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.900
WAIT A SECOND, ARE YOU
GOING TO GIL'S PARTY ?

11:03.933 --> 11:06.067
YEAH, YOU KNOW GIL ?
OH, FROM THE CLUB !

11:06.067 --> 11:08.067
YEAH, I'M OLD
FRIENDS WITH GIL, YEAH.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.700
WE'VE BEEN BUDDIES
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:09.733 --> 11:12.167
SO, CAN I FOLLOW
YOU OVER THERE ?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.167
SHOULD YOU BE
GOING TO THE PARTY
WITH YOUR BACK ?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.733
CAN YOU BEND OVER,
CAN YOU BEND WITH YOUR BACK ?

11:16.767 --> 11:18.100
YEAH.

11:18.133 --> 11:20.567
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST BEND OVER AND KISS MY ASS.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.733
AND MAYBE NEXT TIME
YOU'LL REMEMBER TO PICK UP
THE FUCKING GOLF BALL.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.700
SO, HOW'D IT GO ?

11:57.067 --> 12:00.133
GOOD, PRETTY GOOD.

12:02.067 --> 12:04.167
PRETTY, PRETTY,

12:04.200 --> 12:07.900
PRETTY,
PRETTY GOOD.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.800
( phone )

12:17.333 --> 12:19.067
HELLO ?

12:19.100 --> 12:22.067
WE CALLED
THREE TIMES.

12:22.067 --> 12:25.733
I HAVE NO IDEA,
WE'RE COMPLETELY LOST.

12:25.767 --> 12:27.800
SO, 15 MINUTES...
15 MINUTES...

12:27.833 --> 12:29.200
ONE DRINK.
ABSOLUTELY.

12:29.233 --> 12:31.367
IN AND OUT.
IN AND OUT,
I'M WITH YOU.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.600
I PROMISE,
15 MINUTES.

12:33.633 --> 12:34.833
OKAY.

12:34.867 --> 12:37.500
HOW COME THERE ARE ONLY
THREE CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY ?

12:37.533 --> 12:39.667
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S VERY WEIRD.

12:40.967 --> 12:41.933
LARRY !

12:41.967 --> 12:42.933
HEY, GIL.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.233
HEY, HI,
COME ON IN.

12:44.267 --> 12:46.467
OH, HI, GOOD
TO MEET YOU.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.767
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.900
WHAT HAPPENED
THERE ?

12:48.933 --> 12:50.400
I TALKED TO YOU
15 MINUTES AGO,

12:50.433 --> 12:52.100
YOU WERE FIVE
MINUTES AWAY.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.433
YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT
MILLER TURNS INTO...

12:54.467 --> 12:55.600
JAKE'S WAY,

12:55.633 --> 12:57.867
JAKE'S WAY IS NOT MARKED,
THERE'S NO SIGN FOR IT.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.600
YOU MAY HAVE INCLUDED THAT
IN THE DIRECTIONS.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.067
THANKS FOR TELLING ME.

13:02.067 --> 13:03.600
CAN I TAKE
YOUR JACKET ?

13:03.633 --> 13:04.633
OH, OKAY.

13:04.667 --> 13:05.867
WHERE IS
EVERYBODY ?

13:05.900 --> 13:07.733
EVERYBODY'S RIGHT IN THERE,
AND CAN I TAKE YOUR COAT ?

13:07.767 --> 13:08.800
NO, NO, THANKS.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.867
AND, IF YOU WOULD
TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF.

13:10.900 --> 13:11.867
OKAY.

13:11.900 --> 13:12.900
( Larry )
REALLY ?

13:12.933 --> 13:14.300
YEAH, JUST
TAKE THEM OFF.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.067
IT'S JUST A CUSTOM MY WIFE
STARTED IN THE HOUSE.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.200
I THINK I'LL
LEAVE MINE ON,
IS THAT OKAY ?

13:18.233 --> 13:19.867
THEY'RE
COMPLETELY
CLEAN.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.367
YEAH, IT'S
NOT ABOUT THAT.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.533
LOOK, SEE ?

13:22.567 --> 13:25.600
THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
JUST TAKE 'EM OFF.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.167
AH, COME ON.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.433
OKAY, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

13:30.467 --> 13:32.767
I'LL PUT THIS AWAY,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.767
GO ON IN,
JUST GO ON IN.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.067
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE ?

13:42.067 --> 13:44.167
I DON'T KNOW,
WHERE IS EVERYBODY ?

13:47.500 --> 13:48.700
WHAT ?

13:48.733 --> 13:51.267
THERE'S PEOPLE
EATING DINNER IN THERE.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.667
THIS IS A
DINNER PARTY ?

13:55.067 --> 13:57.733
DID HE TELL YOU
THIS WAS A DINNER PARTY ?

13:57.767 --> 14:00.167
NO, HE SAID PARTY.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.533
WE JUST ATE.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.767
HE SAID PARTY.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.600
I WOULDN'T GO
TO A DINNER PARTY.

14:05.633 --> 14:07.067
HEY, YOU GUYS
LOOKING AROUND ?

14:07.067 --> 14:09.833
GREAT PLACE,
MY WIFE JOKINGLY
REFERS TO IT

14:09.867 --> 14:12.067
AS "THE HOUSE
THAT CUM BUILT".

14:12.067 --> 14:14.067
'CAUSE OF MY PORN.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.500
I NEVER MADE ENOUGH
MONEY TO BUY A HOUSE.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.767
COME ON IN, THOUGH,
I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND LATER.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.467
THAT'S A COLLECTION
OF JUST SMALL BOTTLES

14:24.500 --> 14:26.067
AND I LIKE THEM.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.900
IT'S VERY
INTERESTING.

14:27.933 --> 14:31.200
THERE NOT AS
BIG AS NORMAL.

14:31.233 --> 14:32.833
COME ON IN HERE.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.067
( Gil )
HEY, EVERYBODY !

14:34.100 --> 14:35.600
THEY'RE HERE,
THEY MADE IT.

14:35.633 --> 14:36.700
( Larry )
HELLO, HI.

14:36.733 --> 14:40.067
I'M SO SORRY
WE'RE LATE, HELLO.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.567
HI CHERYL,
NICE TO MEET YOU,
I'M MELANIE.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.567

... SID AND HIS WIFE.

14:47.067 --> 14:49.100
AND, NEXT
TO THEM, BRIAN.

14:49.133 --> 14:50.800
YOU KNOW BRIAN
FROM THE CLUB, RIGHT ?

14:50.833 --> 14:52.067
GLAD YOU MADE IT.

14:52.067 --> 14:53.067
THANK YOU.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.867
( Gil )
NEXT TO HIM
IS JACKIE AND PAUL.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.733
HI, I'M CHERYL.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.533
( chattering )

15:01.267 --> 15:02.633
SIT DOWN.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.800
OKAY.

15:04.833 --> 15:07.100
HONEY, LARRY IS
WEARING HIS SHOES.

15:07.133 --> 15:08.233
I KNOW.

15:08.267 --> 15:09.967
DID YOU TELL HIM IT WAS
THE RULE OF THE HOUSE ?

15:10.067 --> 15:11.667
I THINK HE THINKS
I WAS JOKING.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.067
HONEY, WHO
IS THIS GUY ?

15:13.067 --> 15:14.533
HE COMES TO THE HOUSE
AN HOUR LATE,

15:14.567 --> 15:16.467
AND HE'S WEARING
HIS SHOES IN MY HOUSE ?

15:16.500 --> 15:18.333
I'LL TELL YOU,
WE WAITED,

15:18.367 --> 15:20.133
AND WE WAITED
AND WE WAITED.

15:20.167 --> 15:21.133
I KNOW.

15:21.167 --> 15:23.800
AND THEN WE DECIDED
WE JUST HAD TO EAT.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.233
LET ME
FIX YOU A PLATE.

15:26.267 --> 15:28.067
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
WE WERE SO HUNGRY,

15:28.067 --> 15:31.067
THAT WE HAD
A BAG OF POTATO CHIPS
IN THE CAR...

15:31.100 --> 15:33.367
POTATO CHIPS ON THE WAY
TO A DINNER PARTY ?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.733
WHAT'S THAT ?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.633
THAT'S A
MANGO-CHUTNEY
THAT I MADE

15:36.667 --> 15:38.633
WITH MY OWN HANDS.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.233
I'LL JUST HAVE
SOME OF THAT.

15:40.267 --> 15:42.067
FOR, LIKE,
A DESSERT THING.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.267
( male )
WHAT'S IN THAT ?

15:43.300 --> 15:45.067
( Gil )
THERE'S A LITTLE
BIT OF JALAPENO

15:45.067 --> 15:46.967
AND A LITTLE
BIT OF TABASCO.

15:47.067 --> 15:50.133
( female )
TELL US AGAIN !

15:50.167 --> 15:52.400
NO, C'MON !

15:52.433 --> 15:54.867
CAN'T I EVER HAVE
A NORMAL DINNER PARTY ?

15:54.900 --> 15:57.800
CAN'T WE TALK
ABOUT STOCKS ?

15:57.833 --> 15:59.667
CAN I TELL
A PORN STORY ?

15:59.700 --> 16:02.433
SHE'S HEARD
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

16:02.467 --> 16:03.833
YOU WANNA TELL IT ?

16:03.867 --> 16:06.067
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT
TABASCO'S GOOD FOR ?

16:06.100 --> 16:07.700
KEEP YOU HARD.

16:07.733 --> 16:08.867
( male )
REALLY ?

16:08.900 --> 16:10.400
YEAH, ONLY
YOU GOTTA,

16:10.433 --> 16:12.067
STICK IT UP
YOUR ASS.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.833
NO, I'LL TELL YOU HOW
I FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT.

16:14.867 --> 16:18.500
I WAS DOING A SCENE
AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

16:18.533 --> 16:20.467
A TWO GIRL
SCENE, RIGHT ?

16:20.500 --> 16:21.833
DO YOU MIND
IF I TELL ?

16:21.867 --> 16:23.267
IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.067
THESE GUYS HAVE HEARD
HALF THESE STORIES.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.633
SO, I'M DOING
THIS SCENE,

16:26.667 --> 16:28.133
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
TWO GIRLS.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.967
AND, WE KEEP WAITING FOR
THE OTHER GIRL TO SHOW UP.

16:30.067 --> 16:32.800
AND I'M FUCKING THIS
GIRL FOR THREE HOURS.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.400
POUNDING, POUNDING,
FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS,

16:38.433 --> 16:41.700
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
AFTER A COUPLE HOURS,

16:41.733 --> 16:43.833
IT FEELS LIKE SOME
CHICK'S TEA-BAGGING ME.

16:43.867 --> 16:44.933
RIGHT ?

16:44.967 --> 16:47.067
YOU SHOULD FILL HER IN
ON TEA-BAGGING, THOUGH.

16:47.067 --> 16:49.267
MAYBE YOU DO,
MAYBE YOU DON'T.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.067
WHEN A WOMAN
SUCKS YOUR BALLS,
SHE'S TEA-BAGGING YOU.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.633
BUT, SO I FEEL THAT

16:54.667 --> 16:56.600
AND I THINK THAT
OTHER GIRL'S SHOWN UP.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.967
AND, THEN I FEEL
HER FINGERS ON MY BALLS.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.400
AND I'M NOT
EVEN LOOKING.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.067
I'M JUST SO,
I'M HALF ASLEEP.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.067
BUT, I TURNED AROUND,
IT'S NOT THE GIRL.

17:04.100 --> 17:07.700
IT IS THE BIGGEST
CREW GUY WE GOT

17:07.733 --> 17:11.067
IS PLAYING
WITH MY BALLS.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.767
AND MY WOOD STARTS
GOING DOWN, YOU KNOW,

17:14.800 --> 17:16.700
AND I HAVEN'T
EVEN SHOT YET.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.533
AND I GO, I'M GOING DOWN,
I'M GOING DOWN.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.500
AND THIS GUY GOES,
"I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT."

17:21.533 --> 17:23.233
HE RUNS OVER TO
THE CRAFT SERVICE TABLE,

17:23.267 --> 17:25.867
HE COMES BACK,
HIS FINGER IS RED.

17:25.900 --> 17:32.167
STICKS IT UP MY ASS,
TABASCO SAUCE !

17:32.200 --> 17:34.867
AND I STAYED HARD
FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS

17:34.900 --> 17:38.067
BECAUSE ALL
THE BLOOD JUST GOES.

17:38.067 --> 17:40.367
I KEEP BEGGING HIM
TO LET US USE IT.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.400
I WAS RENOWNED FOR
BEING ABLE TO STAY HARD

17:42.433 --> 17:44.133
FOR HOURS.

17:44.167 --> 17:45.733
THAT'S WHAT
I COULD DO.

17:45.767 --> 17:47.433
I WASN'T
THE BIGGEST, ALRIGHT ?

17:47.467 --> 17:50.667
BUT, I COULD STAY HARD
THE LONGEST, SO.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.100
HEY, LARRY,

17:52.133 --> 17:53.833
CAN I SEE THAT
WATCH A SECOND ?

17:53.867 --> 17:55.533
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT ?
IT'S A BEAUTY.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.733
ANNIVERSARY GIFT.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.533
CAN I SEE THAT ?

17:59.567 --> 18:01.700
OH, THAT IS
REALLY SWEET.

18:01.733 --> 18:05.367
OKAY, EVERYONE, LET'S
HAVE A LITTLE DESSERT.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.167
EVERYONE, PLEASE,
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.133
BRING YOUR GLASSES,
BUT LEAVE YOUR PLATES.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.667
DO NOT TOUCH
YOUR PLATES.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.067
( male )
THAT WAS GREAT, MEL,
THANK YOU.

18:13.067 --> 18:15.433
( Mel )
THANK YOU.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.367
I WANT TO
GO HOME NOW.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.267
MAYBE WE CAN STOP AND
PICK UP SOME TABASCO.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.233
DO YOU THINK THIS
IS FUNNY, LARRY ?

18:30.267 --> 18:32.067
'CAUSE I DON'T
THINK YOU'RE FUNNY.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.633
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS FUNNY.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.533
AND, I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU TELL THESE PEOPLE,
WE NEED TO GO.

18:36.567 --> 18:37.967
OKAY.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.067
( Gil )
SIT DOWN.

18:41.567 --> 18:44.100
ALRIGHT, I'LL TELL
THEM WE'RE LEAVING.

18:44.133 --> 18:46.333
YEAH, AND I NEED
MY COAT AND MY PURSE.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.200
OKAY.
OKAY.

19:01.367 --> 19:03.467
OOH, MY BACK.

19:04.567 --> 19:06.400
OH, SHIT !

19:06.433 --> 19:08.667
OH, I'M SO SORRY !

19:08.700 --> 19:11.633
EVERYONE SIT DOWN,
THERE'S GLASS ON THE FLOOR !

19:11.667 --> 19:12.933
NO ONE MOVE !

19:12.967 --> 19:15.200
I'M SO SORRY,
SHIT !

19:15.233 --> 19:17.133
BUT, IT DOESN'T
REALLY AFFECT YOU,
DOES IT LARRY ?

19:17.167 --> 19:18.533
THE GLASS ON
THE FLOOR.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.767
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE WEARING
YOUR FUCKING SHOES IN MY HOUSE !

19:20.800 --> 19:23.067
WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH MY DOOR,
YOU PLAY BY MY RULES !

19:23.067 --> 19:25.400
YOU TAKE OFF
YOUR FUCKING SHOES !

19:25.433 --> 19:27.233
YOU AND YOUR FUCKING
LITTLE SOCCER SHOES

19:27.267 --> 19:28.867
IN MY HOUSE !

19:28.900 --> 19:31.267
MY FEET HAVE
A TENDENCY

19:31.300 --> 19:33.667
TO GET A LITTLE CHILLY
WHEN I TAKE MY--

19:33.700 --> 19:34.833
GIL !

19:34.867 --> 19:36.600
GET THE COATS !

19:36.633 --> 19:39.067
THE COATS ARE PROBABLY
A GOOD IDEA.

19:39.067 --> 19:40.833
I WOULD THINK.

19:40.867 --> 19:42.600
HE'S A PSYCHOTIC,
GET HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE !

19:42.633 --> 19:45.200
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
GET MOSEYING.

19:45.233 --> 19:46.700
MOSEYING TIME ?

19:46.733 --> 19:47.900
YEAH.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.767
HEY, HERE
YOU GO, CHERYL.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.833
HONEY,
YOU OKAY ?

19:51.867 --> 19:53.600
MAYBE IT IS BEST
IF YOU JUST GO NOW.

19:53.633 --> 19:55.500
YOU KNOW WHAT ? I THINK IT IS,
I THINK IT PROBABLY IS.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.633
LET ME PAY
FOR THE LAMP, OKAY ?

19:57.667 --> 19:59.167
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.633
OH, COME ON,
I'LL PAY FOR THE LAMP.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.833
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF BRIAN
HAS ANOTHER IN HIS SHOP.

20:02.867 --> 20:05.533
I DON'T KNOW, THEY'RE
REALLY HARD TO GET.

20:05.567 --> 20:08.767
( Gil )
IT WAS RARE,
WE GOT IT IN BRIAN'S SHOP.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.500
MAYBE I HAVE ONE MORE,
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK.

20:11.533 --> 20:13.633
OKAY, OKAY,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE OFF.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.933
NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:15.967 --> 20:18.000
NICE TO
MEET YOU TOO.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.533
GOODBYE.

20:19.567 --> 20:22.200
BYE, CHERYL,
NICE MEETING YOU.

20:27.533 --> 20:29.900
SO, WHAT'S THE LEVEL
OF ANGER HERE ?

20:29.933 --> 20:31.967
WHAT AM I
DEALING WITH ?

20:32.000 --> 20:37.033
WELL, I'D SAY
AT LEAST AN 8.7.

20:37.067 --> 20:39.733
8.7 ? THAT'S
NOT THAT BAD.

20:39.767 --> 20:41.033
NO ?

20:41.067 --> 20:42.900
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,
LIKE, A NINE, 8.7 ?

20:42.933 --> 20:44.867
NO, IT WAS,
IT WAS UP HIGHER.

20:44.900 --> 20:46.633
YEAH, AND THEN
YOU BROKE THAT LAMP

20:46.667 --> 20:49.167
AND THAT CRAZY WOMAN
SCREAMED AT YOU.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.267
AND IT GOT YOU
SOME PITY POINTS.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.300
PITY POINTS ?
FABULOUS !

20:53.333 --> 20:54.800
I LOVE
PITY POINTS.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.233
YEAH.

20:56.267 --> 20:57.933
ANY WAY
TO GET TO A SEVEN ?

20:57.967 --> 20:59.267
I DON'T KNOW.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.167
I KNOW I CAN'T GET TO A SIX,
THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.067
WE COULD HAVE A VERY
DECENT RIDE HOME WITH A SEVEN.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.067
YOU THINK SO ?

21:05.067 --> 21:06.400
YES, I DO.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.133
AND IF WE RIDE HOME AS A SEVEN,
AS SOON AS WE GET HOME,

21:09.167 --> 21:11.133
YOU CAN GO RIGHT BACK
TO AN EIGHT.

21:11.167 --> 21:13.167
ALRIGHT,
IT'S A DEAL.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.400
IT'S A DEAL ?

21:14.433 --> 21:16.367
YEAH, AS LONG
AS I CAN GO BACK.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.433
BEAUTIFUL.

21:17.467 --> 21:19.633
COME ON,
WE'LL GO HOME.

21:23.367 --> 21:24.600
OH...

21:24.633 --> 21:25.733
WHAT ?

21:29.133 --> 21:30.833
OH, MY GOD.

21:30.867 --> 21:31.967
WHAT ?

21:32.067 --> 21:33.533
REMEMBER THAT TRAINER,

21:33.567 --> 21:36.367
WHO ASKED TO
LOOK AT MY WATCH ?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.067
HE NEVER
GAVE IT BACK.

21:38.100 --> 21:40.100
GO BACK THERE
AND GET IT.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.267
OH, NO, COME ON.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.300
DON'T SEND ME
BACK THERE, PLEASE ?

21:43.333 --> 21:45.067
WE'RE RIGHT HERE,
JUST GO BACK IN.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.667
I DON'T WANT TO DO
A DOUBLE GOODBYE.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.300
I'VE ALREADY
SAID GOODBYE

21:48.333 --> 21:49.933
UNDER THE WORST
POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES.

21:49.967 --> 21:51.700
NOW YOU WANT ME TO GO IN
AND DO THE DOUBLE GOODBYE ?

21:51.733 --> 21:52.867
YEAH, I DO.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.933
LARRY, I GAVE THAT TO YOU
AS AN ANNIVERSARY GIFT.

21:55.967 --> 21:57.667
WELL, I'LL CALL GIL
AND HE'LL HAVE THE TRAINER

21:57.700 --> 21:59.300
SEND IT TO HIM
OR SOMETHING.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.433
THAT IS IDIOTIC, WE'RE HERE,
JUST GO BACK IN.

22:01.467 --> 22:02.800
IT'LL TAKE
THREE MINUTES.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.233
IT'S SO
AWKWARD, THOUGH.

22:04.267 --> 22:05.700
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
WITHOUT THE WATCH.

22:05.733 --> 22:07.700
THIS IS STUPID,
JUST GO.

22:09.167 --> 22:11.400
I GOTTA TAKE
MY SHOES OFF NOW.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.267
HEY, LARRY.
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

22:25.300 --> 22:28.067
I THINK YOUR TRAINER
HAS MY WATCH.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.633
HE DOES ?

22:29.667 --> 22:31.067
EXCUSE ME.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.667
DO YOU HAVE MY WATCH,
BY ANY CHANCE ?

22:32.700 --> 22:35.533
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I DO.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.733
YEAH, GO ON.

22:38.767 --> 22:40.700
ALSO, I'M GONNA
NEED DIRECTIONS

22:40.733 --> 22:42.267
TO GET BACK
TO THE FREEWAY.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.100
OKAY, I'LL GO GET YOU
ANOTHER COPY, SURE.

22:46.367 --> 22:48.467
OH, GEEZ,
LOOK AT THIS.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.067
WHAT A MESS.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.833
SORRY.

22:51.867 --> 22:53.867
THAT'S OKAY,
NO PROBLEM.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.233
WELL, BYE.

22:55.267 --> 22:57.267
SEE YOU
AT THE STORE.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.800
YEAH, SO LONG.

22:58.833 --> 23:01.067
NICE TO MEET
YOU, OKAY.

23:06.533 --> 23:08.733
HERE YOU GO,
THESE ARE GOOD.

23:08.767 --> 23:12.067
AND JUST WATCH
FOR THE BARN.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.433
THE BARN ?

23:13.467 --> 23:15.067
YOU GOTTA TAKE
A RIGHT AT THE BARN.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.933
RIGHT AT
THE BARN, OKAY,
THANK YOU.

23:16.967 --> 23:18.433
ALRIGHT,
TAKE CARE,
GOODBYE.

23:18.467 --> 23:19.900
SAY GOODBYE
EVERYONE.

23:19.933 --> 23:21.467
GOODBYE.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.633
YOU ALRIGHT ?

23:31.667 --> 23:33.067
NO, IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

23:33.100 --> 23:34.667
SOUNDED LIKE
YOU KNOCKED.

23:34.700 --> 23:35.700
NO.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.233
OKAY.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.533
IS THAT A BARN ?

23:43.567 --> 23:45.367
IS THAT A BARN ?

23:45.400 --> 23:47.700
I THINK IT WAS
TOO SMALL FOR A BARN.

23:47.733 --> 23:50.733
IT LOOKED MORE
LIKE A STABLE.

23:50.767 --> 23:53.200
THERE WAS A COW THERE,
DOES THAT MEAN, WHAT ?

23:53.233 --> 23:55.467
THAT IT COULD
HAVE BEEN A BARN ?

23:55.500 --> 23:57.633
THERE'S NO COWS
IN BARNS.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.767
THERE ARE
COWS ON A FARM.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.267
ARE THERE ALWAYS
BARNS ON FARMS ?

24:02.300 --> 24:04.533
THERE'S STABLES
ON FARMS, RIGHT ?

24:04.567 --> 24:06.600
NOT NECESSARILY BARNS.

24:06.633 --> 24:08.767
I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS THE BARN.

24:08.800 --> 24:12.333
I THINK WE MADE
THE WRONG TURN.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.933
( alarm beeping )

24:47.733 --> 24:49.500
( beeping stops )

25:05.067 --> 25:07.067
( Jeff )
GO UP TO MY BEDROOM.

25:07.067 --> 25:08.933
TO THE LEFT OF THE TV.
THERE'S A CABINET,

25:08.967 --> 25:10.867
BY THE BOOKCASE THERE.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.800
OPEN IT UP
AND MOVE THE LINENS.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.533
THERE'S LINENS IN THERE,
MOVE 'EM TO THE SIDE.

25:14.567 --> 25:16.300
PUSH ON
THE BACK DOOR.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.900
INSIDE THERE, I HAVE,
LIKE, MY PORN COLLECTION.

25:56.833 --> 25:58.600
( female )
Who is it ?

25:58.633 --> 26:00.900
Hotel security,
ma'am, open up.

26:00.933 --> 26:02.667
Thank God
you're here.

26:05.933 --> 26:07.767
There's a
prowler outside.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.233
I'm really,
really scared.

26:09.267 --> 26:10.667
I can hear noises.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.967
Take it easy, take it easy,
sit down.

26:13.067 --> 26:15.500
Listen, we've had some reports
of prowlers in the area.

26:15.533 --> 26:16.800
( glass breaking )

26:16.833 --> 26:18.333
What the hell
was that ?

26:18.367 --> 26:20.067
Come out of there
with your hands out.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.400
Put your hands out !

26:21.433 --> 26:23.600
( female )
It's okay,
it's my girlfriend.

26:23.633 --> 26:26.100
Looks pretty safe,
I'm gonna go back
to the hotel.

26:26.133 --> 26:28.067
No, no, you can't leave,
you can't leave us.

26:28.067 --> 26:29.867
But, there's
other people.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.300
There's a
prowler outside.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.533
You can't leave us.

26:32.567 --> 26:37.667
Alright, oh, yeah,
yeah...

26:37.700 --> 26:40.600
Come on !

26:40.633 --> 26:42.567
( moaning )

26:49.133 --> 26:51.167
Yeah, you
called security,

26:51.200 --> 26:53.600
You got it.

26:54.433 --> 26:56.067
( loud moaning )

26:57.567 --> 26:59.333
OH, MY GOD !

27:00.233 --> 27:01.933
HI !

27:03.900 --> 27:05.867
THAT'S A FRIEND
OF MINE.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.167

27:08.200 --> 27:10.267
I HAD DINNER
AT HIS HOUSE,
