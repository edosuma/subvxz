13:30.435 --> 13:31.470
SONYA: Not yet.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.053
What's the next bank?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.891
I need a list of
all the clients whose
boxes were rifled.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.105
Clients pay
for their anonymity.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.986
And empty
doesn't mean stolen.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.904
All right.
Fair enough.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.857
But only some of these
boxes were opened.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.030
How would the thieves
know which ones to target?

13:49.121 --> 13:50.406
I don't know.
Lucky guess?

13:50.706 --> 13:52.742
KIERA: Now, they didn't
care if they were seen
in the lobby.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.199
But in here,
they wanted to hide
what they were doing.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.705
We're gonna need
that list.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.009
Sonmanto holds a number
of safe deposit boxes

14:06.096 --> 14:07.802
and uses them
primarily as back-up

14:07.889 --> 14:10.426
for pending patents,
contracts, etc.

14:11.143 --> 14:12.758
Well, itwill be
very helpful to
our investigation

14:12.853 --> 14:14.684
to know exactly
what's been removed.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.557
I checked the records
as soon as we heard
about the robbery.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.229
That particular box
was empty.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.433
As I mentioned,
we have more than
a few.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.689
You do know that impeding
a police investigation

14:23.780 --> 14:25.111
is a very
serious offense?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.281
And you know that
as a Fortune 500 company,

14:28.368 --> 14:29.699
we have a full
complement of lawyers

14:29.786 --> 14:31.777
that can back-up
my truthful and
helpful statement.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.157
But why go there?

14:33.248 --> 14:35.739
Liber8 is behind this
robbery, Mr. Richardson.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.703
You don't want them
having anything of yours.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.414
And they don't.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.464
You went at him
pretty hard.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.883
Yeah, well, I don't
need a future chip
to know that

14:46.970 --> 14:48.130
he's lying his ass off.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.928
We've got half
the companies filing for
losses they can't prove

14:51.016 --> 14:53.473
and the other half
denying anything was
stolen at all.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.266
Yeah. Well, thatjust means
whatever they have,

14:55.353 --> 14:56.889
they weren't
supposed to have.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.481
You don't sound surprised.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.646
Yeah, well, I had
that knocked out of me.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.776
Carlos.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.986
I want to help you
get through this.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.616
What can I do?

15:09.659 --> 15:12.321
Well, you remember your
dead body in the trunk?

15:12.412 --> 15:13.572
How about
you erase that?

15:16.333 --> 15:19.746
Yeah, so it's unusual.
Thermite charges
with an accelerant.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.454
Uh, the explosive load
designed to implode
towards the body.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.455
That's why there were
no casualties.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.958
Except for these three,
of course.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.926
Pop Rocks?

15:33.809 --> 15:35.390
You ever heard of
anything like this?
(POP ROCKS CRACKLING)

15:35.727 --> 15:37.843
Ugh! No, I haven't.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.270
FlU retrieved wiring
and components

15:40.357 --> 15:42.598
that suggest
a radio transmitter.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.225
Let me see that.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.143
Radio transmitter.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.403
But, the bank cameras
caught them pressing
the trigger?

15:48.490 --> 15:51.072
Hmm. If you
say so, yeah.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.280
It's just a weird set-up.
You know, imploding.

15:54.371 --> 15:57.283
How close would
someone have to be to
trigger the detonation?

15:57.374 --> 15:58.454
I'm a blood and guts guy.

15:58.542 --> 15:59.907
That's a little bit
out of my depth.
I'm not sure.

16:00.001 --> 16:03.459
I've got a guy
that swims in
these waters. May I?

16:03.547 --> 16:05.128
Um, yeah, okay.
Sure.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.421
Need it back.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.297
Is there anything else
that's not in the playbook?
(CLAYTON INHALES)

16:11.388 --> 16:13.800
Well, with an explosion
there's a little bit
of everything,

16:13.890 --> 16:15.596
but I did notice
these components

16:15.684 --> 16:18.391
had more
cerebral spinal fluid
than I expected.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.102
ALEC: So, this is soaked
in brain juice?

16:21.273 --> 16:22.638
Apparently.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.394
Is it the kind of thing
that could be
remotely triggered?

16:26.528 --> 16:28.018
I don't know.
I can'tjust
look at a thing

16:28.113 --> 16:29.978
and automatically
know what it means.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.857
But, from what you say,
it could be like an
on-board computer.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.863
A chip that
receives signals.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.286
A primitive CMR.
In a way.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.363
Some labs are working on
brain-to-brain interface.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.665
They've used it on
insects, monkeys, rats.

16:43.253 --> 16:44.789
It's like an
actual mind meld.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.499
No? Uh...

16:47.591 --> 16:49.047
It's like the Internet,
but for brains.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.634
Well, Sonya's got
the surgical chops.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.803
Lucas can program
pretty much anything.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.430
Did they have
human drones
in the future?

16:58.268 --> 16:59.633
Not exactly.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.976
Cyborgs. Robots.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.554
Cool.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.105
Not cool.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.978
Liber8 infiltrated
the systems

17:07.068 --> 17:08.899
and hatched the robots
to use as weapons.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.352
They became a liability.

17:10.447 --> 17:13.029
In the end, all non-human
workers were destroyed.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.447
(SCOFFS) Less cool.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.293
Did you know Escher
was my father?

17:28.715 --> 17:29.750
No.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.921
I figured.
ljust wondered if...

17:35.889 --> 17:37.174
I never had a father.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.760
Not that
I could remember.

reaching out to you.

In his own way.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.731
Oh, yeah,

Maybe I'll sell it
right now.

You don't have to do
anything today.

to be devastating,

feel it yet.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.296
I don't know
what I'm feeling.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.298
Escher was trying to
run my life.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.016
lnvading it.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.724

a different way.

Carlos, I went over it
again last night,

19:50.565 --> 19:52.305
and the only thing
that makes sense

19:52.400 --> 19:56.734
is that Liber8 is fishing
for something specific in
those safety deposit boxes.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.361
Do you have any idea
what that could be?

19:58.448 --> 20:00.029

A lot of these corporations
are using

20:01.451 --> 20:03.442
with long-life

Now, these units emit very
low electromagnetic radiation

20:06.289 --> 20:08.029
which can be picked up
using the right gear.

But, it means nothing

going to hit next.

we destroy the corporate
congress of the future.

40:02.693 --> 40:05.025
And take a look
at this from their
secure drive.

40:07.364 --> 40:08.774
Oh, Sonmanto.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.443
You're a naughty company.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.651
Whatever the play,
it has to do double-duty.

40:14.288 --> 40:16.495
We lost ground
with the human bombs.

40:16.873 --> 40:18.158
When did you get
so squeamish?

40:18.250 --> 40:20.491
When you turned men
into things.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.621
Some men deserve it.

40:32.639 --> 40:33.970
Thank you.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.757
I thought
you'd still be
in the hospital.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.510
I'm supposed to go back.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.144
See a specialist.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.727
I still got wires in there
and they don't want to
mess around.

40:45.402 --> 40:46.642
Me neither.

40:49.656 --> 40:50.816
(SUITCASE OPENS)

40:52.326 --> 40:54.191
How would you like
to change the world?

40:56.455 --> 40:57.444
How'd you get that?

40:57.706 --> 40:58.912
We're Sonmanto.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.039
We have friends everywhere.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.075
And between
this little box

41:04.171 --> 41:06.036
and the wires
left in you, Mr. Ryan,

41:07.049 --> 41:08.835
you can throw
those away for good.

41:09.384 --> 41:10.885
Miracle cure, is that it?

41:11.637 --> 41:12.877
You tell me.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.720
You were the one walking
around six hours ago.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.553
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

41:32.407 --> 41:33.908
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

41:35.494 --> 41:36.483
Hey.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.534
Hi, it's me.
How you doing?

41:39.206 --> 41:40.696
You should see
the lab here.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.577
Anything I can think of
I can find.

41:43.085 --> 41:46.498
You sound like someone
who's changing his mind
about an inheritance.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.416
Piron's got fingers
in hundreds of pies,

41:49.508 --> 41:51.464
which should sound menacing,
or at least greedy,

41:51.885 --> 41:53.170
but I don't know,
some of these projects...

41:53.261 --> 41:54.512
There's so much potential.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.466
So, your father wasn't
that bad after all.

41:57.724 --> 41:58.759
Maybe not.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.808
Maybe you’ll find
a way to reconnect
my CMR.

42:03.605 --> 42:04.720
I knew you missed us.

42:05.732 --> 42:07.108
Of course, I did.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.693
Let’s get things
back to normal.

42:14.408 --> 42:15.773
Whatever normal is.

42:16.910 --> 42:18.366
Sorry, Kiera,
I have to go.

42:39.933 --> 42:40.922
(INAUDIBLE)

42:56.324 --> 42:57.700
It's better
if he doesn't know.
