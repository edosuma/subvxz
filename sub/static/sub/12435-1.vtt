00:41.193 --> 00:43.991
Why is the new bride so dejected?
- Because last night...

00:44.096 --> 00:47.463
husband and bride slept apart.
- That's for the first night

00:47.666 --> 00:49.657
lt's said to be ominous.
But it's over

00:49.835 --> 00:52.463
''From tonight, man and wife
will sleep together''

00:54.940 --> 00:56.931
Are you harassing the bride?

00:57.142 --> 00:59.133
Sit...
sit Parvati

00:59.744 --> 01:05.842
''You know, we had everything here,
but the Moon. And now you're here''

01:08.386 --> 01:10.684
Now you are
the lady of the manor

01:11.056 --> 01:13.047
Also a mother
to these children

01:15.227 --> 01:17.491
''From his first wife,
Bhuvan has three children''

01:17.829 --> 01:21.697
''Your son, Mahendra.
- Obeisances, Chhoti-Ma''

01:22.734 --> 01:26.693
''And our youngest, little Kalika.
- My obeisances, Chhoti-Ma''

01:27.339 --> 01:29.330
''And Yashomati, the eldest''

01:30.008 --> 01:34.274
She's angry. You must placate her

01:34.846 --> 01:36.609
And all of you...

01:36.715 --> 01:39.513
you must adorn
the bride exquisitely...

01:39.851 --> 01:42.115
for her nuptial night

01:46.458 --> 01:48.449
Have you familiarised yourself
with the manor?

01:48.660 --> 01:52.391
''Yes.
- You have my word, Parvati...''

01:52.731 --> 01:56.258
''in this manor, you will have
no problems about anything''

01:56.801 --> 01:58.996
Except one

01:59.538 --> 02:03.668
lt is difficult to bide time here.
- Oh but time flies here

02:04.109 --> 02:10.673
l do not understand...?
- A while ago l was a new bride

02:11.583 --> 02:14.347
''And in no time, l'm Chhoti-Ma
(Chhoti-Ma :little Mother )''

02:14.753 --> 02:19.087
''From bride to ''little Mother'',
l'm transformed. ln no time''

02:19.457 --> 02:24.156
l wish to tell you something.
l married because my Ma insisted

02:25.130 --> 02:29.430
''My children needed a mother,
and this manor needs a lady''

02:31.036 --> 02:33.027
And you...?

02:35.707 --> 02:39.234
Subhadra... was my first wife

02:40.712 --> 02:43.977
''You're now the lady of the manor,
the mother of my children...''

02:44.716 --> 02:49.653
''and my new bride, no doubt.
But Subhadra, l can never forget''

02:50.655 --> 02:55.991
''The ominous first night may be over.
But we will stay distanced, forever''

02:57.128 --> 03:01.326
''My mistake or my sin,
call it what you may...''

03:01.833 --> 03:03.824
but do forgive me

03:19.384 --> 03:23.081
''Good morning friend, good morning.
You're lucky, my friend''

03:23.488 --> 03:26.355
l ask help of the spirits
to knock me out of my senses

03:26.591 --> 03:30.493
You won't even touch the spirits
and yet you are inebriated?

03:31.229 --> 03:38.192
You missed telling me? Or made
a pariah of me? Paro and paramour

03:39.904 --> 03:42.702
''Both spelt with ''p''! Your stupor
has unravelled all your secrets''

03:44.142 --> 03:46.076
Who brought me here?

03:46.645 --> 03:52.641
''My lover
is so faithless''

03:54.352 --> 03:59.051
''How regrettable, to be rescued
off the streets by a prostitute''

04:01.726 --> 04:07.392
This one is an ingrate Chuni Babu!
Bites me for the love l gave him

04:07.666 --> 04:12.069
My word! She helped you out of
humane concern. You were sick

04:12.237 --> 04:17.072
''She picked you up from the streets.
You've come to, after two days''

04:17.676 --> 04:22.670
''She never slept a wink, nursed you,
sat through your cries for Paro''

04:23.381 --> 04:26.248
lnsult instead of gratitude?

04:26.484 --> 04:33.356
Let it pass. lt's a landlord trait.
Never mind their little trespasses

04:34.859 --> 04:39.694
''You left as if, forever.
But as luck would have it...''

04:39.831 --> 04:43.096
l find you once again.
Medicine...

04:44.035 --> 04:46.435
you need it. Now

04:48.707 --> 04:52.234
''Your medicine, l don't need.
l'd rather have lain there''

04:52.644 --> 04:58.048
Just fall unconscious once again.
l'll dump you where l found you

04:58.316 --> 05:00.307
Yes Chuni Babu?

05:04.989 --> 05:06.650
What is this?
- Chuni Babu says...

05:07.058 --> 05:11.324
you've been here for two nights.
Lamps in your boudoir went unlit

05:12.130 --> 05:15.463
This is price. For two nights
you wasted on me

05:20.672 --> 05:24.472
''Now l know,
why Paro abandoned you''

05:25.677 --> 05:29.340
''Let alone love,
you don't even deserve sympathy''

05:30.148 --> 05:34.482
Hear Chuni Babu?
A courtesan talking of romance

05:35.687 --> 05:40.852
''Am l to learn of her what love is,
what romance be? What is amour?''

05:41.159 --> 05:46.961
''Love mirrored in your soul, amour
God's gift to life's design, romance''

05:49.734 --> 05:54.831
How regrettable Chuni Babu
Your friend possesses none...

05:55.173 --> 05:58.233
''of soul, or intent or purpose''

05:58.910 --> 06:02.641
That thing you flash
time and again Dev Babu...

06:03.448 --> 06:06.178
''the money, it lies at the feet
of harlots in brothels''

06:07.018 --> 06:12.650
''lf you be so vain, return to me
what l spent on you''

06:13.725 --> 06:15.386
Two nights

06:15.660 --> 06:20.461
''You owe me 2 nights, Dev Babu.
No more shall l dance...''

06:20.665 --> 06:25.659
not until you come.
These eyes will await you

06:29.707 --> 06:36.670
''F for friendship, she came seeking,
you found a foe. You owe two nights''

06:38.817 --> 06:42.014
O'faithless lover

06:50.328 --> 06:52.319
Music plays

06:53.231 --> 06:55.222
Let slip the veil

06:57.702 --> 07:00.227
Let the revelry begin

07:00.638 --> 07:08.636
''Revelry awaits you, Chandramukhi.
- No, not until Dev Babu arrives''

07:12.350 --> 07:16.047
''Pure gold.
Custom made, in Lucknow''

07:16.988 --> 07:18.922
l also have a gold nose ring

07:19.057 --> 07:21.992
l wish to tie the dancing bells
to your feet

07:23.661 --> 07:26.892
Do wear the nose ring and
allow me to unscrew it afterwards

07:27.131 --> 07:33.127
Desist from such ardour Kali Babu.
Get too close and you will burn...

07:33.671 --> 07:36.469
in the very lamps that light up
nights of revelry

07:37.075 --> 07:41.671
At the next instance of insolence
l'll give you a nose ring and...

07:42.013 --> 07:44.914
the rest of the revelers
may take pleasure in unscrewing

07:45.083 --> 07:47.677
ln a marketplace
full of beauties...

07:47.785 --> 07:51.084
such spirit
is what draws me to you

07:52.023 --> 07:55.356
But the one you
await so eagerly...

07:55.760 --> 07:59.696
has no interest
in you or your music

08:01.132 --> 08:07.696
lt was some Paro's firefly that ran
into your fires crying Paro-Paro

08:08.506 --> 08:14.706
''Never will he return, Chandramukhi.
- He will come, he will Kali Babu''

08:16.714 --> 08:22.710
You will see. That's from my heart.
- Why not take on a bet?

08:24.889 --> 08:27.722
lf he doesn't come before
the candle has burnt out...

08:28.126 --> 08:31.118
then you will wear these
dancing bells...

08:31.729 --> 08:34.630
only for my pleasure.
- l accept

08:37.434 --> 08:39.426
And if he comes...

08:39.736 --> 08:45.539
then you shall leave
wearing these very dancing bells

08:50.748 --> 08:52.181
Agreed

09:22.180 --> 09:24.614
Whose footfall?

09:25.583 --> 09:27.710
Whose shadow?

09:28.886 --> 09:31.218
Who knocks at my heart?

09:32.223 --> 09:34.714
Who is come?

09:45.903 --> 09:51.671
Who paints me this emerald?

09:52.310 --> 09:56.303
My joy...

09:58.116 --> 10:00.107
is killing me

11:00.978 --> 11:07.679
No Moon l ever desired...

11:10.722 --> 11:15.056
nor stars l ever seeked...

11:15.426 --> 11:18.691
complaints l have none...

11:21.999 --> 11:25.696
every sorrow l have hidden...

11:26.437 --> 11:30.430
every taunt l laughed off...

11:31.709 --> 11:37.375
thorns l embraced...

11:37.815 --> 11:43.720
their blossoms have wounded me

11:50.661 --> 11:56.657
But whenever l have prayed...

11:57.201 --> 11:59.465
of The Lord...

11:59.670 --> 12:02.662
l have always seeked you

12:16.687 --> 12:19.349
Who paints me this emerald?

12:19.590 --> 12:22.491
is killing me

12:22.693 --> 12:25.685
l'm slain

14:04.662 --> 14:10.066
You aren't accustomed to the drink.
Why drink beyond your limits?

14:14.205 --> 14:16.673
What fool drinks
to stay within limits?

14:18.109 --> 14:21.010
l drink that l may force myself
to stay on...

14:22.947 --> 14:28.214
''looking at you,
tolerating you...''

14:29.854 --> 14:32.914
''that l may lose my senses,
to help me forget Paro''

14:33.257 --> 14:34.519
But Chandramukhi...

14:34.692 --> 14:37.684
''such are memories of Paro, they
won't even let me lose my senses''

14:40.698 --> 14:45.226
''Why, after all l drink, do memories
of her haunt me day and night?''

14:46.837 --> 14:48.429
Why...

14:49.640 --> 14:51.631
oh why?

14:55.046 --> 14:57.640
''Why, does man become so naive?''

15:00.651 --> 15:02.642
Why make mistakes?

15:03.654 --> 15:08.455
Why... for foible...
so harsh a punishment?

15:11.662 --> 15:13.653
As to be rent asunder?

15:15.433 --> 15:18.664
''One enters matrimony,
and the other...?''

15:30.681 --> 15:32.979
Slain

15:46.697 --> 15:49.825
ln what fain folly...

15:50.101 --> 15:52.194
he forsakes the lotus...?

15:52.636 --> 15:54.866
For a paper flower?

16:00.111 --> 16:02.102
l fall...

16:05.683 --> 16:09.119
Touch me not!
l despise you!

16:10.121 --> 16:13.989
l can't bear to see woman
come to this. Begone

16:17.461 --> 16:20.225
Never again shall
l stand at this door

16:23.167 --> 16:25.931
''But yes, whenever
l come to think of Paro, l shall''

16:26.837 --> 16:30.329
''And come the guilt pangs,
l shall come''

16:33.477 --> 16:36.241
For where else can l go?

16:38.682 --> 16:43.381
There... l have sentenced myself.
- Why punish yourself so?

16:45.022 --> 16:48.219
''Because every day,
my heart is put to trial''

17:01.839 --> 17:04.307
''Every day,
this romance is tried''

17:08.646 --> 17:11.171
''But every day,
the verdict is the same''

17:22.827 --> 17:24.589
You are convicted

18:03.701 --> 18:05.100
Paro

18:08.939 --> 18:13.137
Our Parvati decides whatever
happens in the manor

18:14.011 --> 18:18.004
The new bride has laid to rest
all my worries

18:18.782 --> 18:22.718
With Parvati's arrival our
lost days of joys are here again

18:23.721 --> 18:28.055
Meet Yashomati's mother-in-law
This is Parvati

18:28.726 --> 18:31.217
''To Bhuvan Chaudhary,
you'd more likely be...''

18:31.462 --> 18:35.523
a daughter than his wife.
- Whatever l am to him...

18:35.933 --> 18:40.734
you and l are like sisters.
We should be embracing each other

18:40.938 --> 18:43.930
But you are many years
my elder

18:44.241 --> 18:50.407
''From what l see, in Manikpur, wives
are better endowed than daughters''

18:50.681 --> 18:55.084
''No Badi-Ma?
- Our daughters, we send away...''

18:55.386 --> 19:01.086
''in hope that they will be cared for,
but we're disappointed. No, Badi-Ma?''

19:03.394 --> 19:06.693
Yashomati.
l was eager to meet you

19:07.097 --> 19:12.034
We ought not to be cross with kin.
You and l are of the same age

19:12.369 --> 19:15.361
''So you decide,
how we will relate to each other''

19:15.573 --> 19:18.235
Mother and daughter?
Or friends?

19:20.110 --> 19:22.101
Ma

19:26.584 --> 19:30.987
''What's this, Ma? All this...?
- Gifts, from your Ma''

19:31.522 --> 19:33.422
You'll look great

19:35.392 --> 19:39.328
Will you keep to your daughter?
Won't you give us company?

19:39.630 --> 19:45.626
l do not like the smoking pot.
- The smoking pot has pride of place

19:45.836 --> 19:50.273
''l don't think so, no pride in what
goes up in smoke''

19:50.474 --> 19:53.671
''Wonderful, mother-in-law!
l delight in your words''

19:54.778 --> 19:59.681
l have been so eager to see you.
We missed each other's weddings

20:00.384 --> 20:01.942
My obeisances

20:06.890 --> 20:11.259
Touching your feet was a pleasure.
l have been given my wish

20:12.696 --> 20:15.358
How l wish l had attended
your wedding...

20:15.766 --> 20:18.963
if only to have my wish of
pulling you up by your ear

20:20.271 --> 20:23.365
Pulling you up by the ear
was a pleasure

20:25.509 --> 20:28.376
''This first acquaintance, l shall
always remember, mother-in-law''

20:29.179 --> 20:31.511
Remember the relationship too

20:58.342 --> 21:04.212
''Mr Landlord! Hurry up!
Look, Paro is here''

21:04.682 --> 21:06.673
Paro! How have you been?

21:06.750 --> 21:08.741
l've been expecting you for days.
- Why the crowd next-door?

21:08.852 --> 21:11.343
ls everything all right?
- Narayan Mukherjee

21:11.488 --> 21:15.356
Breathing his last
- Shouldn't we be there?

21:15.793 --> 21:17.784
My heart won't let me

21:18.162 --> 21:25.091
Will you see the man who told you
and your mother to run a brothel?

21:25.803 --> 21:30.706
Let not mistaken vanity
destroy relationships

21:32.810 --> 21:35.040
l'm going over

21:37.715 --> 21:40.240
''The entire village, all relatives
came to pay their respects''

21:40.451 --> 21:46.447
But no news of his dear son Devdas?
How sad

21:47.791 --> 21:50.658
And here comes someone
who has nothing to do

21:51.695 --> 21:54.459
''Look Babu-ji,
who's here to see you''

21:55.666 --> 21:56.894
Devdas...?

21:57.067 --> 21:59.661
''Master, your Paro is here''

22:04.675 --> 22:07.007
''No, no Babu-ji''

22:09.146 --> 22:15.016
''When you were children, l'd ask you
to find Dev whenever he was lost''

22:16.587 --> 22:20.921
''l've forfeited myself the right,
haven't l, Sumitra?''

22:22.159 --> 22:25.026
''All night, he was asking,
where's Dev-where's Dev?''

22:26.497 --> 22:29.694
''Now where do l look for him,
my tempest...?''

22:37.708 --> 22:39.505
What happened?

22:45.315 --> 22:48.443
''lf l am so despicable, if my touch
be so abhorrent, then why...''

22:48.652 --> 22:50.643
did you come into my life?

22:51.021 --> 22:55.287
ln my solitude l was content
Why be my messiah of misery?

22:59.763 --> 23:03.756
That stopped the spasm didn't it?
Divert your attentions and...

23:03.901 --> 23:07.667
the deepest wounds may be healed.
- Which is what l am upto

23:08.739 --> 23:11.674
''Stop it, you've had enough''

23:14.578 --> 23:20.676
Why not say l've lived enough?
- How could l...?

23:22.219 --> 23:29.148
''You have Paro, memories of Paro
All l have is you, my Midas''

23:29.893 --> 23:32.487
A touch
and iron is made to gold

23:33.964 --> 23:39.869
Are you pricing yourself or me?
- ln a world of relationships...

23:40.003 --> 23:43.700
what value a woman
of easy virtue? Nothing

23:44.107 --> 23:47.975
''Besides, you won't even give me
the right to touch you''

23:51.648 --> 23:58.645
Are you in love with me?
- Or you could ask me if l breathe

24:01.658 --> 24:04.058
''You breathe, Chandramukhi?''

24:08.298 --> 24:11.665
''What will you get out of it?
l have no home, no heart''

24:13.670 --> 24:20.132
''Loving isn't only about receiving.
Love, l have traded many times''

24:21.044 --> 24:23.877
''But loved, l have but once''

24:29.019 --> 24:32.682
''Pour more into a chalice filled,
and what happens?''

24:34.958 --> 24:37.290
''lt spills,
to the ground''

24:40.697 --> 24:44.497
''So too my cup floweth over,
with Paro''

24:46.336 --> 24:48.964
More can only spill...

24:49.206 --> 24:55.975
''to fall, and in the falling,
take you down too''

24:57.948 --> 25:05.184
''But in the spilling, the wine
must've been caressed by the chalice''

25:16.066 --> 25:18.057
Then spill...

25:19.670 --> 25:21.661
some more

25:33.016 --> 25:36.474
Where is Devdas?
l must see him

25:37.087 --> 25:42.491
Asleep. You can't see him now.
- Can l not? l'm here to take him

25:42.693 --> 25:44.684
l'm not leaving him
in this hell

25:48.031 --> 25:50.625
Master...!
- Who gave you my whereabouts?

25:50.968 --> 25:52.629
Chuni Babu

25:52.936 --> 25:53.925
Babu-ji...

25:54.004 --> 25:57.633
Babu-ji won't even see my face
Why has he sent you?

25:58.642 --> 26:02.976
''Anyway, he will be displeased
to see me as l am''

26:05.649 --> 26:09.642
Sir Narayan Mukherjee will have
to hang his head in shame

26:14.658 --> 26:18.651
''Go Dharamdas, go away.
- Listen Deva...''

26:22.199 --> 26:24.667
Your father is no more

27:27.664 --> 27:29.461
Too bad

27:32.736 --> 27:36.672
All of a sudden... how...?

27:39.676 --> 27:41.667
He was a nice man

27:43.480 --> 27:45.675
Such men aren't born too often

27:56.526 --> 27:58.687
Babu-ji has earned...

28:02.365 --> 28:04.697
''another title, no?''

28:05.802 --> 28:09.101
Late Sir Narayan Mukherjee

28:10.841 --> 28:13.105
We loved each other dearly

28:14.711 --> 28:18.112
''But too bad, this is too bad''

28:24.154 --> 28:26.714
''Late, Sir Mukherjee...''

28:30.594 --> 28:33.062
was a good man

28:37.134 --> 28:40.729
Does Devdas drink every day?
- When doesn't he drink?

28:41.138 --> 28:43.732
''Alcohol, day and night.
Lives on it''

28:44.374 --> 28:48.003
Why don't you stop him?
- But only if he'd stay at home

28:48.345 --> 28:51.576
Rarely does he come home.
There he lies in Chitpore...

28:51.681 --> 28:54.047
''in Chandramukhi's brothel,
all day''

28:54.484 --> 28:57.476
The room upstairs is practically
Deva's residence

28:58.688 --> 29:01.350
Devdas! He lives in a brothel?

29:03.560 --> 29:06.085
Such days l have lived to see

29:06.696 --> 29:10.564
Have you seen Chandramukhi?
- When l went to fetch Deva...

29:10.700 --> 29:13.692
l saw her.
- What is she like?

29:14.704 --> 29:20.700
''Sweet deceit, as they say.
Famous courtesan, uses her charms''

29:20.944 --> 29:27.110
''She plunders, he squanders. We must
rescue our Deva from the hell, Paro''

29:27.717 --> 29:31.710
''l cannot tell him anything,
but he'll surely listen to you''

29:32.122 --> 29:35.114
''He holds you in high esteem,
he can't refuse you''

29:35.525 --> 29:37.516
''Please Didi, tell her''

29:37.727 --> 29:41.720
''Only you can stop him, Paro.
Only you can stop him from drinking''

29:42.065 --> 29:46.331
''Dharamdas, get a hold on yourself.
- You'll see him won't you?''

29:52.576 --> 29:56.672
''Paro, do you want me to malign you,
to give you a bad name?''

29:57.113 --> 30:01.379
''Had we given ourselves a bad name,
we might've ended up together''

30:05.956 --> 30:09.687
''You're happy, aren't you Paro?
- Oh it's a different world, Dev''

30:10.694 --> 30:15.495
''Huge manor, vast estates,
important people, great debates''

30:15.699 --> 30:21.103
Great debates!
You've matured Paro

30:22.706 --> 30:27.700
''You even look like an aristocrat.
Huge red dot, large eyes...''

30:28.411 --> 30:30.709
big dreams...

30:31.248 --> 30:33.512
''huge manors,
vast estates...''

30:33.717 --> 30:37.517
and grown-up children

30:46.463 --> 30:49.057
''Those large eyes,
l can keep watching''

30:50.667 --> 30:54.000
But l can't bear to see
big teardrops in those eyes

30:56.673 --> 31:00.370
Just as well that you came by.
l got some things l wish to return

31:00.977 --> 31:05.038
''Who knows, l might never return''

31:06.683 --> 31:08.674
Come...

31:10.086 --> 31:12.077
come with me

31:14.691 --> 31:16.682
Stand right here

31:23.166 --> 31:24.690
Look...

31:24.834 --> 31:27.701
at yourself. Remember...?

31:30.607 --> 31:32.507
Arre O'Deva

31:36.579 --> 31:38.706
What happened Paro?

31:39.015 --> 31:41.506
''Deva, l lost my anklets.
Have you seen them?''

31:42.719 --> 31:45.210
''No Paro, not l''

31:46.656 --> 31:48.556
l stole them

31:48.725 --> 31:52.161
And you knew l did it
and why l did it

31:55.665 --> 31:57.257
''All day, the chime of your anklets,
and-Deva-this-and-Deva-that...''

31:57.467 --> 31:59.662
And your pot

32:00.103 --> 32:03.004
''And here, the memento
of our love, our parting''

32:03.740 --> 32:06.675
''You just left, that was the end
of the relationship''

32:07.210 --> 32:09.678
''But l'm still tied
to all these, Paro''

32:10.680 --> 32:12.671
And l am tied
to memories of you

32:12.882 --> 32:15.680
What's that?
- A few coins

32:15.752 --> 32:18.687
Three Rupees.
- All they're worth are memories

32:19.289 --> 32:21.951
''Mine, aren't they? You thief''

32:24.694 --> 32:28.255
''l'll take them back,
but only with usury''

32:29.699 --> 32:33.032
How much interest will you take?
- Two percent

32:34.704 --> 32:37.400
At two percent...

32:38.108 --> 32:40.167
six cents a month

32:40.410 --> 32:42.401
72 cents a year

32:43.113 --> 32:45.104
For 13 years...

32:45.982 --> 32:47.973
''13 years, Paro''

32:48.651 --> 32:50.642
9.36

32:51.988 --> 32:57.153
''You've become good at arithmetic.
- Circumstance taught me, Paro''

32:57.994 --> 32:59.985
Let's talk of something else

33:01.898 --> 33:07.393
''Paro, why not turn matchmaker
and find a bride for Devdas?''

33:07.771 --> 33:15.337
''l hear Manikpur girls are nice?
- Yes, but you want a beauty, no?''

33:15.578 --> 33:18.843
''No, not a beauty.
Just someone like you''

33:21.484 --> 33:25.011
''Someone who is pleasant?
- No, must be a bit naughty''

33:25.121 --> 33:29.217
''Should be able to quarrel with me.
Like l said, she should be like you''

33:29.926 --> 33:32.918
You can find them by the thousands.
- Spare me the thousands

33:33.196 --> 33:35.687
''Just let me come to grips with
only one, of the likes you. Enough''

33:39.803 --> 33:43.705
Give up drinking.
- No

33:43.973 --> 33:45.304
Try.
- No

33:45.442 --> 33:48.639
You can give it up. Promise me
that you'll never drink again

33:48.912 --> 33:51.642
Can you promise
you'll forget me?

33:55.652 --> 33:57.643
''lt's rather late, Paro''

34:00.824 --> 34:03.054
l'm not leaving
until l have your word

34:03.226 --> 34:04.659
l can't.
- You can

34:04.828 --> 34:09.389
One can do anything one wants.
- Can you elope with me tonight?

34:09.666 --> 34:11.896
What are you saying?
- Can you elope with me?

34:12.001 --> 34:14.799
You've no one to look after you.
- Can you elope with me?

34:15.004 --> 34:19.464
''l had only one dream. To serve you.
- lf there's love, there's no fear''

34:19.676 --> 34:23.476
One chance to fulfill my dream?
- Can you elope with me? Can you?

34:23.679 --> 34:26.478
''Come with me. l'll care for you.
- Can you elope with me, Paro?''

34:26.616 --> 34:29.676
''l can't bear to see you like this!
l feel like dying, Dev''

34:30.887 --> 34:33.219
l feel like dying

34:34.690 --> 34:41.255
''lf serving me makes you happy,
then so be it''

34:43.699 --> 34:49.639
''l promise you, before l die
l'll surely come to your doorstep''

34:53.543 --> 34:56.239
''Swear that, by me''

35:20.036 --> 35:21.833
Heartless

35:29.879 --> 35:33.440
Your mother is squandering money.
Given so charitable a disposition...

35:33.583 --> 35:38.020
''soon the coffers will be empty.
- Absolutely right, Kumud''

35:38.688 --> 35:44.684
But how can l stop Ma?
- You're such a complete fool

35:45.929 --> 35:52.164
You can't. But l can stop her.
- You will stop her? But how?

35:54.704 --> 35:58.640
The keys to the vault? With you?
Ma has been looking for them

36:03.046 --> 36:07.847
l've hidden the keys.
You will say that the keys are lost

36:08.017 --> 36:11.214
What...?
- The vault keys are lost

36:12.655 --> 36:16.455
And the vault has been robbed

36:21.664 --> 36:23.461
The key...

36:23.666 --> 36:25.327
to the money

36:27.670 --> 36:30.662
Brother-in-law! You...?
So early? ln the offices?

36:31.241 --> 36:35.405
And alcohol...? Without as much
as a care for the family prestige?

36:35.812 --> 36:39.009
What will people say?
What will your mother think?

36:39.682 --> 36:42.480
You didn't consider that
when you were stealing the keys?

36:42.752 --> 36:47.416
What will people say?
What will your Chhoto-Ma think?

36:47.624 --> 36:51.151
The wealth of our forefathers
may not be squandered over alcohol

36:52.328 --> 36:56.321
The keys left by our forefathers
may not be stolen like this

36:56.666 --> 37:00.500
l'm making this clear.
Under no circumstance...

37:00.637 --> 37:04.801
am l parting with the keys.
- You will turn in the keys

37:06.042 --> 37:08.977
Today and now

37:11.381 --> 37:13.042
Right here

37:14.651 --> 37:16.551
To my mother

37:16.753 --> 37:21.520
Do not think l am so weak. l too
hail from a family of landlords

37:21.858 --> 37:24.452
l have seen money by the chestfuls
in my father's house

37:25.928 --> 37:28.920
Have you seen the streak of madness
that runs in the family?

37:37.807 --> 37:40.469
''What are you upto, Dev?
- Brother you surely agree that...''

37:40.677 --> 37:47.480
l have as much right as you to the
wealth that our forefathers left us

37:47.917 --> 37:50.408
Yes. Why are you
pouring alcohol?

37:55.692 --> 38:01.562
l'm putting on fire my share.
Save your share if you can

38:03.700 --> 38:08.694
l'll give you anything you want!
- As of now...

38:09.605 --> 38:12.506
only the keys.
- Which you will never have

38:18.981 --> 38:21.779
''Kumud! Give him the keys.
Else, he'll burn down the office''

38:21.984 --> 38:25.442
Let him do whatever he wants.
l'm not scared of empty threats

38:32.729 --> 38:35.630
He's actually burning the place down!
Call Chhoto-Ma

38:35.765 --> 38:37.858
''Give him the keys, Kumud.
- No''

38:38.000 --> 38:39.991
He's crazy!
Are you out of your mind too?

38:40.069 --> 38:41.798
No!
- Give him the keys

38:42.238 --> 38:44.229
What's up Kumud?

38:44.907 --> 38:47.671
What's happening in this house?

38:54.684 --> 38:58.017
''You were looking for the keys
to the vault, weren't you?''

38:58.488 --> 39:02.686
l caught him with the keys
and he threatened me

39:03.092 --> 39:07.358
He won't part with the keys
and he wants his share

39:07.697 --> 39:13.693
''Else, he'll burn the house down.
l pleaded with him...''

39:16.706 --> 39:19.504
You want your share?

39:23.713 --> 39:25.704
That is your only share

39:28.151 --> 39:30.381
No one in this house
ever understood you

39:30.820 --> 39:33.516
All of us are responsible
for your ruination

39:33.923 --> 39:39.054
''Before we lead you
to worse, leave this house''

39:39.729 --> 39:43.529
''Babu-ji said leave the village.
Everyone said, leave Paro''

39:43.800 --> 39:48.464
''Paro said, leave drinking.
Now you say, leave this house''

39:48.771 --> 39:51.103
''One day, He will say...''

39:52.074 --> 39:54.668
leave this world

39:56.412 --> 39:59.677
Hereby l rescind all my rights
to everything in this house

40:03.686 --> 40:08.487
But l am part of you. That right
no one takes away from me

40:09.158 --> 40:11.149
Not even you

41:07.583 --> 41:09.881
''lt's no easy undertaking,
it's an ancient ritual''

41:10.253 --> 41:16.249
''For the ritual, one must fetch
the soil from a courtesan's doorstep''

41:16.893 --> 41:20.021
''ln that soil, is built
the image of the goddess''

41:20.363 --> 41:21.921
l know

41:22.098 --> 41:26.501
And go where men daren't even walk
in daytimes for fear of censure?

41:26.836 --> 41:32.240
Don't humans live there?
ls there no air...?

41:32.608 --> 41:38.046
No sun in those quarters?
Do rains refuse to visit them?

41:38.714 --> 41:41.512
Nature doesn't discriminate.
Should we?

41:41.851 --> 41:46.652
Parvati is right.
Even Subhadra wanted it done

41:47.356 --> 41:50.052
''Very well,
as our Parvati wishes''

41:50.660 --> 41:55.063
''But remember, it's the Durga Puja.
- Rest assured''

41:55.932 --> 42:00.062
l'll tell Mahendra
to facilitate your journey

42:02.338 --> 42:05.205
Devdas lives in a brothel?

42:08.678 --> 42:12.136
''A lady is here, wants to see you.
She's also asking about Dev Babu''

42:13.683 --> 42:15.981
Must be Paro

42:22.692 --> 42:23.954
Paro...?

42:24.594 --> 42:29.691
How did you know l'm Parvati?
- Dev Babu told me...

42:30.132 --> 42:35.695
''should a woman come asking for him,
she can only be Paro''

42:36.305 --> 42:38.705
What are you doing?

42:39.275 --> 42:44.508
''My obeisances to the woman, whom
l shall never be able to replace''

42:44.880 --> 42:52.286
''l have heard of exotic women here,
but you possess the wile too''

42:52.822 --> 42:56.553
''Only if you'd see,
l have a heart too''

42:56.759 --> 43:00.024
Chandramukhi...
isn't that your name?

43:02.665 --> 43:05.065
They also call me Devdasi

43:07.803 --> 43:12.672
You are famous.
- Not anymore

43:13.075 --> 43:14.667
Why ?

43:15.077 --> 43:20.674
''At angel's touch, l learnt
of a sacrifice l never knew''

43:22.685 --> 43:27.145
How strange of a courtesan
to swear by fidelity

43:27.990 --> 43:30.481
Curious too...

43:31.360 --> 43:34.693
what draws an aristocrat
to a courtesan's doorstep?

43:36.499 --> 43:38.490
Where is Dev?

43:39.001 --> 43:44.098
l too am eager to hear his footfall
Six months it has been...

43:44.707 --> 43:48.871
since l set my eyes on him.
- You lie

43:50.646 --> 43:55.310
''lf you don't trust, look around.
- Or do you assume l won't?''

43:56.052 --> 43:58.646
How long do you think
you can keep Dev here?

43:59.055 --> 44:03.048
''Only so long as the beauty,
the youth, the money?''

44:03.993 --> 44:09.329
What's your endgame?
You must have fleeced Dev

44:09.732 --> 44:14.999
l'll pay you more. l can't bear
to see Dev suffering this hell

44:18.808 --> 44:20.673
How strange

44:22.144 --> 44:28.083
''The very Paro who drove Dev Babu
to insanity, wants to buy him''

44:31.754 --> 44:35.690
And what may you have to offer me?
Can you offer social recognition?

44:36.692 --> 44:39.354
Can you possibly
make him love me?

44:39.695 --> 44:42.391
''Or make it possible
that l may touch him, just once?''

44:42.798 --> 44:48.430
''Dreams, longing, hopes,
that he has kindled in my heart...''

44:48.804 --> 44:52.638
might you make them come true?
Can you?

44:54.043 --> 44:56.637
''No, you cannot deliver''

44:58.714 --> 45:03.651
And l will not give you Dev Babu.
- And l will take him away

45:04.653 --> 45:11.354
''And no one is stopping me. Not you,
not social sanction, not even Dev''

45:12.762 --> 45:17.665
''Not to forget, courtesans
aren't destined to have husbands''

45:20.770 --> 45:23.671
''Courtesans have no destiny, lady''

45:40.589 --> 45:46.619
''From your perspective,
you can see nothing. From mine...''

45:47.763 --> 45:50.357
you will find him everywhere

45:51.967 --> 45:55.630
''Look, there he is,
in the flame of the lamp''

45:56.639 --> 45:59.039
''There he lies,
in folds of the covers''

45:59.508 --> 46:01.442
ln that half a chalice...

46:01.644 --> 46:06.638
''his thirst lies, unquenched.
His fragrance still lingers''

46:07.716 --> 46:14.383
''Take it all, if you can. The light,
the folds, the fragrance, all of it''

46:25.000 --> 46:26.797
All yours

46:27.837 --> 46:32.274
But l cannot give you your Devdas.
- You love Dev so dearly?

46:33.843 --> 46:36.175
l only worship him

46:37.680 --> 46:41.081
Now l'm assured.
Dev isn't lonely anymore

46:43.686 --> 46:49.352
Oh l forgot what l came here for.
l want to perform the Durga Puja

46:50.025 --> 46:52.255
''From your doorstep,
l want soil''

46:52.628 --> 46:54.619
May l...?

47:06.742 --> 47:11.645
What is this?
- l came for Dev. lnstead...

47:11.881 --> 47:14.645
it's something
l entrust you with

47:15.985 --> 47:19.978
l will expect you for
the Durga Puja. Do come

47:47.016 --> 47:49.007
Chandramukhi...

47:51.820 --> 47:53.811
l'm so happy
to have you here

47:54.023 --> 47:56.014
l'm glad

47:56.292 --> 48:00.228
How could l refuse your invitation?
l had to come

48:00.696 --> 48:03.290
Have you met Dev?

48:06.702 --> 48:08.693
Who is this?

48:09.305 --> 48:13.435
''Chandramukhi, my friend.
She comes from Calcutta''

48:14.343 --> 48:20.043
''Bless you, consider this your home.
Parvati, don't let her go too soon''

48:20.516 --> 48:24.247
Sure. You will leave only after
the celebrations

48:24.720 --> 48:27.518
No Paro! l can't stay here

48:27.723 --> 48:31.921
Why not? lt's been ages since l had
a heart-to-heart chat with someone

48:32.328 --> 48:36.128
''Come, let celebrations be the ruse
for forgetting our woes''

48:36.598 --> 48:39.726
''Let's sing, dance,
give ourselves a little to live''

48:39.902 --> 48:43.133
No...
- Our joys might touch Dev

48:43.906 --> 48:47.672
''Paro, listen to me.
- No refusing. For Dev's sake''

48:48.978 --> 48:51.674
''Come Kali Babu, the chess game
isn't over yet''

48:52.681 --> 48:55.479
The real chessgame
is being played here

48:55.718 --> 48:59.677
Devdas' Chandramukhi comes.
To meet Devdas' Paro

48:59.888 --> 49:02.152
Who's Paro?
- Mother-in-law

49:03.092 --> 49:07.028
Parvati. One move and
l've checkmated all four

49:07.963 --> 49:09.692
Paro

49:09.832 --> 49:11.493
Chandramukhi

49:11.700 --> 49:13.691
Bhuvan Chaudhary

49:13.936 --> 49:15.699
Devdas

49:17.873 --> 49:20.103
''Deva, the day is dawning''

49:22.778 --> 49:25.713
''But forever, this heart
will live in darkness''

49:26.715 --> 49:29.206
Shall we go now?
- To whom?

49:29.818 --> 49:32.981
''One by one, all my
relationships are over''

49:33.856 --> 49:38.122
''Between my father and l
there was no love lost, right?''

49:40.429 --> 49:43.728
l was his tempest
and he was my whip

49:55.677 --> 49:59.670
''Even my brother figured first
in mother's lullaby, right?''

50:01.116 --> 50:08.682
''My brother and l never hit it off.
He's practical, l'm impractical''

50:10.759 --> 50:14.490
One inculcates a humorous
relationship with a brother's wife

50:15.497 --> 50:19.024
''l was the one who ended up
being the butt of the joke, right?''

50:21.870 --> 50:27.274
And there was Paro
and l love her...

50:27.876 --> 50:29.503
you know...

50:29.711 --> 50:31.440
so much

50:34.883 --> 50:37.443
''So much, right?''

50:48.063 --> 50:50.657
Now she is estranged too

50:57.673 --> 51:01.404
But there's one...

51:02.377 --> 51:05.369
one Chandramukhi.
Loves me dearly

51:05.581 --> 51:07.276
But...

51:11.153 --> 51:12.882
priest?

51:15.257 --> 51:17.020
Priest...

51:26.034 --> 51:28.594
Are you familiar with the last rites?
- Of course

51:28.770 --> 51:32.035
Will you perform the ritual?
- Of course. Who is the deceased?

51:32.307 --> 51:34.707
Devdas Mukherjee
- Are you insane?

51:35.711 --> 51:37.941
You'll perform your last rites?
- Give me my last rites

51:38.113 --> 51:39.978
''Priest, go away''

51:53.162 --> 51:55.995
Deva! What madness is this?

51:56.665 --> 51:57.654
Come back

51:58.667 --> 52:02.262
Unto the departed Soul...

52:02.671 --> 52:05.663
''grant salvation, Lord''

52:06.708 --> 52:09.176
''Come back, l beg of you''

53:49.111 --> 53:52.376
The throb...

53:52.648 --> 53:56.311
sways my heart

54:11.266 --> 54:14.394
''l dare that evil eye
or let thunder strike''

54:14.736 --> 54:17.671
l'll wear my dancing bells

54:18.073 --> 54:21.804
ln my anklets...

54:22.110 --> 54:25.409
''l will give in
to the ecstasy...''

54:25.681 --> 54:29.242
of the throb...

54:29.584 --> 54:33.076
''that sways
my heart, my soul''

54:51.406 --> 54:54.967
What chimes?

54:55.544 --> 54:58.445
What's that love in eyes?

54:58.714 --> 55:02.241
Why the crescendo?

55:02.651 --> 55:05.984
ls it longing?

55:09.791 --> 55:12.658
He's in the red dot l wear

55:13.161 --> 55:15.994
He's in the dream in my eyes

55:16.765 --> 55:19.666
You're obsessed

55:20.669 --> 55:23.467
Your heart beats for him

55:24.039 --> 55:28.032
l remember him in the chime

55:30.812 --> 55:35.078
l remember him in the tinkle

56:41.483 --> 56:47.285
You've given me a world...

56:48.623 --> 56:55.028
of your own happinesses

56:55.730 --> 57:00.190
Never desert him

57:03.004 --> 57:07.441
Marry him

57:10.645 --> 57:15.639
To him you are priceless

57:17.752 --> 57:23.054
l am worthless

58:40.535 --> 58:42.196
Wonderful

58:42.871 --> 58:45.203
What a display of true colour

58:45.941 --> 58:51.402
An aristocrat and a courtesan
come together

58:53.181 --> 58:56.014
''What are you saying?
- That which you see, Badi-Ma''

58:56.351 --> 58:58.342
And what everyone is watching

58:58.687 --> 59:02.680
''This woman, whom Mother-in-law
calls a friend, is a whore''

59:03.024 --> 59:05.015
Yes Mother-in-law?

59:07.028 --> 59:09.360
What am l hearing Parvati?

59:10.131 --> 59:13.692
Why are you silent? Answer.
- She is embarrassed

59:14.135 --> 59:18.697
Landlords did keep whores

59:19.307 --> 59:23.505
Now even a lady of the manor makes
friendships in brothels. Wonderment

59:24.512 --> 59:31.509
That's stripping without touching.
You started the farce. l ended it

59:31.820 --> 59:36.723
''No Kali Babu, if men could
enact farce, what need for whores?''

59:37.192 --> 59:39.422
You would've had
your brothel too

59:40.328 --> 59:42.728
You know it
and it's commonplace

59:43.198 --> 59:46.463
lt is the aristocrat
who brings cheer to the brothels

59:47.002 --> 59:50.460
And bastards are born
of aristocrats of your ilk

59:51.006 --> 59:55.340
''Call them illegitimate if you will,
but aristocracy runs in their veins''

59:55.677 --> 59:58.578
Company of the aristocracy doesn't
confer status to the courtesan

59:58.713 --> 01:00:03.673
''Absolutely correct, Badi-Ma. But why
should the lady be embarrassed?''

01:00:04.085 --> 01:00:09.489
''lf she spoke a few kind words to me,
it's because she considers me human''

01:00:10.692 --> 01:00:15.686
He who frequents the alleyways
of disrepute ought to be ashamed

01:00:16.598 --> 01:00:20.034
The very dens littered with trophies
of the lust of his forefathers

01:00:20.935 --> 01:00:26.396
Have you thought? You might have
a sister somewhere in the brothels

01:00:27.242 --> 01:00:29.710
Why sister? You might even
visit your daughter's...

01:00:33.214 --> 01:00:35.705
ln the soil
at the courtesan's doorstep...

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:40.310
is moulded the image of the goddess.
The soil isn't impotent

01:00:42.724 --> 01:00:45.124
Now the farce ends

01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:53.396
''l return, lady...''

01:00:53.835 --> 01:01:00.673
''back to my world,
to those disreputable alleys...''

01:01:01.676 --> 01:01:04.668
where l might someday find
Dev Babu again

01:01:07.682 --> 01:01:09.479
Farewell

01:01:21.557 --> 01:01:24.048
''Before leaving,
l wish to apologise''

01:01:24.627 --> 01:01:28.654
Talking in public
about Chandramukhi was a mistake

01:01:29.732 --> 01:01:34.897
l didn't make the other mistake.
l told your husband and Badi Ma...

01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:38.502
about your friendship
with Devdas

01:01:40.209 --> 01:01:44.509
You liked twisting my ear? l would
cut your nose to spite your face

01:01:45.515 --> 01:01:46.504
Goodbye

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.184
''Not at Parvati,
fingers will be raised at us''

01:01:53.556 --> 01:01:58.118
The matter must end
here and now

01:01:58.528 --> 01:02:01.656
Did you ask for me?
- Yes Parvati

01:02:03.132 --> 01:02:05.862
l would like to know...
- Who Devdas is?

01:02:06.536 --> 01:02:11.872
''Devdas is a childhood friend,
he was body, l was soul''

01:02:13.242 --> 01:02:18.874
''He is my love and he is my vanity
and he is with me, always''

01:02:19.448 --> 01:02:24.351
Do you realise what you are saying?
- Same as what you told me

01:02:25.254 --> 01:02:29.350
''You're now the lady of the manor,
the mother of my children. No doubt''

01:02:29.725 --> 01:02:33.354
''But Subhadra, l can never forget.
- Subhadra was my wife''

01:02:33.729 --> 01:02:37.221
Subhadra was your first love.
Devdas is mine

01:02:38.201 --> 01:02:42.831
''First love, like years
can never be obliterated''

01:02:43.206 --> 01:02:46.698
''Parvati, you are forgetting.
You are the lady of the manor''

01:02:47.076 --> 01:02:54.039
Maybe that's reason for my guilt?
l'll accept any penalty you decree

01:02:54.517 --> 01:02:56.508
Of course you will be punished

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:04.517
The very men who paid obeisances
to this manor are enjoying a farce

01:03:06.095 --> 01:03:12.330
You may never step out of the manor.
This is your punishment

01:03:12.702 --> 01:03:16.695
''But what punishment, Parvati?
We are the ones being punished''

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:22.099
The lamps we lit in celebration
have set fire to our house

01:03:23.246 --> 01:03:26.773
Always put out the fires
that threaten your home

01:03:48.804 --> 01:03:53.002
''Fun, frolic and friends''

01:03:54.510 --> 01:04:00.073
''Without you, life was desolate.
With you, comes the cheer''

01:04:02.118 --> 01:04:09.524
Why care for outcomes?
Let's raise cheer

01:04:10.226 --> 01:04:11.523
Yes friend?

01:04:22.104 --> 01:04:24.538
Let clink the glasses

01:04:29.312 --> 01:04:34.545
''Let clink the glasses,
whatever the outcome''

01:04:56.505 --> 01:05:01.499
''Let clink the glasses,
whatever the outcome''

01:05:03.212 --> 01:05:08.514
''And hear the chhalak-chal
''in the swirl''

01:05:13.522 --> 01:05:18.858
''Music, when my cup floweth over''

01:05:22.965 --> 01:05:28.198
''And hear the dhamk-dhamk-dham
''inside your heart...''

01:05:33.542 --> 01:05:36.238
when you clink the glasses

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:09.501
''This madeira''...''

01:06:10.513 --> 01:06:15.075
''This madeira'' showers
a rain of memories''

01:06:15.518 --> 01:06:19.784
''ln every spill, madeira
''cheats the heart''

01:06:20.523 --> 01:06:23.515
''The madeira'' coursing down
tells...''

01:06:25.227 --> 01:06:29.323
tales of hearts

01:06:30.299 --> 01:06:35.032
''Like lightning in hearts,
it strikes clouds of sorrow''

01:06:35.438 --> 01:06:39.465
And when it reaches the heart...

01:06:40.276 --> 01:06:44.076
it evokes...

01:06:45.481 --> 01:06:48.712
memories of her

01:06:49.518 --> 01:06:54.148
Oh for a glimpse...

01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:59.220
Oh for a glimpse of her

01:06:59.628 --> 01:07:01.892
That's...

01:07:02.298 --> 01:07:06.166
what little l pray for

01:07:07.203 --> 01:07:11.162
So little l pray for

01:07:26.622 --> 01:07:29.182
''Mira dances for her
Ghanshyam...''

01:07:29.525 --> 01:07:33.086
she dances in gay abandon

01:07:46.242 --> 01:07:51.475
''Hear the jhanak-jhank-jhan
''in the chime of her anklets''

01:07:56.785 --> 01:08:00.277
''l'm in love,
l don't care for censure''

01:08:03.459 --> 01:08:04.983
And how...

01:08:09.198 --> 01:08:13.828
''Now hear the thirak-thirak''?
That's my heart dancing away''

01:09:42.524 --> 01:09:45.687
Even a drop of alcohol
is poison for him

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:50.323
Any moment may be treacherous

01:09:51.533 --> 01:09:54.194
Try to keep him in good cheer

01:09:55.437 --> 01:09:56.529
Oh God!

01:10:01.543 --> 01:10:06.537
What is this Dharamdas?
Cry and you will make me cry too

01:10:07.449 --> 01:10:11.249
And people will call me a courtesan
who cannot enact a farce

01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:15.222
''We got to keep Dev Babu
in good cheer, no?''

01:10:15.557 --> 01:10:20.221
You're absolutely right.
Let's wipe our tears

01:10:20.562 --> 01:10:25.556
Let our laughter
ring in Dev's ears

01:10:26.502 --> 01:10:31.064
Yes Dharamdas.
- Let's fill his life with joys

01:10:33.342 --> 01:10:39.508
Yes Dharamdas.
- All his woes be gone

01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:44.616
''Yes Dharamdas, yes''

01:10:46.422 --> 01:10:49.721
Game over. l win again

01:10:52.528 --> 01:10:57.022
No point playing with you!
You've robbed us blind

01:10:57.333 --> 01:11:00.769
A few more games with you and
you'll make me sell this brothel

01:11:01.537 --> 01:11:04.267
Stop giggling and get lost

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.265
Time for your medicine.
l'll send it over

01:11:07.609 --> 01:11:13.138
''ln a chalice. Else, it won't work.
- Even contemplating it is lethal''

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:16.877
Met Paro?

01:11:20.322 --> 01:11:24.349
How did you find my Paro?
- lf love be personified...

01:11:24.693 --> 01:11:28.322
''Paro's would be the being,
hers the very heart''

01:11:29.565 --> 01:11:35.561
''Forbidden though it is, l always
end up with a metaphor about eyes''

01:11:36.438 --> 01:11:39.999
''One Paro
and one, Chandramukhi''

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:43.201
''One, sentimental, vivacious''

01:11:44.179 --> 01:11:47.012
''And you...
how delicate, how demure''

01:11:48.283 --> 01:11:51.252
''She is fickle, like a doe,
gushing like a river...''

01:11:51.587 --> 01:11:56.889
''the liar, the butterfly, the Moon
and you...?''

01:11:57.226 --> 01:12:01.526
''Poem? Ballad?
Some tears, sometimes fire''

01:12:03.532 --> 01:12:09.232
''Everyone loves her.
- And you, unloved by all save me?''

01:12:43.305 --> 01:12:47.833
''What is this, Chandramukhi?
l was likening you to fortitude''

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:54.073
''What you turn out to be? Wax doll?
Look at you, melting away''

01:12:56.518 --> 01:13:00.511
Will you let the candle melt away
and cast me in dark?

01:13:09.531 --> 01:13:15.527
''You've done much for me,
Chandramukhi. One more favour''

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:23.107
Let me leave.
- No! You know not what you suffer

01:13:23.445 --> 01:13:28.644
You know it and l suffer.
- Then why must you...?

01:13:30.452 --> 01:13:34.013
l must face myself
before l'm lost

01:13:36.225 --> 01:13:38.056
May a servant follow you?

01:13:42.397 --> 01:13:46.629
l cannot bear to see my death
mirrored in your eyes

01:14:10.392 --> 01:14:12.383
l have been given heaven and earth

01:14:14.997 --> 01:14:16.988
Will we meet again?

01:14:35.484 --> 01:14:43.653
What the Judge of virtue and vice
will pronounce for you l know not

01:14:45.494 --> 01:14:53.833
''But in the afterlife, should we meet
l won't be able to renounce you''

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:10.742
''As far as the train travels.
Bombay, Delhi, Lahore, Assam''

01:15:12.451 --> 01:15:15.318
''l want to see all of lndia,
are you coming with me?''

01:15:15.754 --> 01:15:20.748
''l'll take you around the world,
if you keep up this cheer''

01:15:22.394 --> 01:15:26.694
''l'm cheerful, am l not?
My final journey has begun''

01:15:40.212 --> 01:15:43.045
''Deva, what is the matter with you?
- What's the matter...?''

01:15:43.949 --> 01:15:45.712
Are you all right?

01:15:47.886 --> 01:15:52.949
How come you haven't left?
- l'm not leaving you all alone

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:58.494
Are you afraid l'll drink again?
- Alcohol is poison for you

01:15:58.864 --> 01:16:01.731
One drop...
- And l'm dead?

01:16:02.034 --> 01:16:06.733
''Yes! You were delirious,
that's why l didn't leave you''

01:16:07.472 --> 01:16:13.138
And enough of this journey. You've
had your say and l've had enough

01:16:13.478 --> 01:16:17.005
''At the next station, we change the
train and we go to see your mother''

01:16:17.482 --> 01:16:22.181
''At the next station,
you go back to your compartment''

01:16:22.554 --> 01:16:26.251
Why are you so stubborn?
- Put out the lights

01:16:26.591 --> 01:16:32.223
''And tomorrow, l'm taking you
to a doctor. Always fickle''

01:16:34.366 --> 01:16:38.097
''Passengers to Sonarpur, Garia,
Phoolbagan to detrain''

01:16:47.145 --> 01:16:49.705
''Dharamdas, you're back?''

01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:00.984
Friend! How are you?

01:17:01.426 --> 01:17:06.955
''Small world it is, that's why
we keep bumping into each other''

01:17:07.632 --> 01:17:15.471
So where and how have you been?
- Right here and l'm fine

01:17:17.743 --> 01:17:24.239
''Tell me how you have been.
- What with me, l'm soaring''

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:30.679
''But you look... pale.
What gives, friend?''

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:38.095
For a moment l was in a quandary.
ls this my star of Chitpore?

01:17:38.497 --> 01:17:41.694
''No, l'm all the same.
- Even if you aren't, here l am''

01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:46.697
''Let's raise cheer.
lt's been long, let's have a party''

01:17:48.573 --> 01:17:51.235
So what if we aren't in a brothel?
Even train compartments will do

01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:55.077
''lf not the dancing bells,
let's cheer the rhythm of the rails''

01:17:55.413 --> 01:17:58.940
''lf not Chandramukhi,
let it be between her paramours''

01:18:04.422 --> 01:18:05.912
Here you are

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:13.721
''No Chuni Babu, l don't drink.
- Someone has extracted a promise?''

01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:19.966
''No.
- Then do it, for friendship's sake''

01:18:20.438 --> 01:18:24.067
After ages! Let's live it up.
Why not?

01:18:24.442 --> 01:18:27.275
''ln a tomorrow, may we be?
Might not''

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:32.339
''You'll be. As for me,
you never know''

01:18:46.198 --> 01:18:52.467
''My share of life l've lived,
now l'm counting on my heart''

01:18:54.406 --> 01:18:59.810
''What with the world, it will even
grudge you your last breath''

01:19:01.479 --> 01:19:05.848
Encore! How sweet!
That's poetry

01:19:06.251 --> 01:19:10.051
''Shards of the heart,
they call poetry. l don't care''

01:19:10.355 --> 01:19:15.725
What hurts is when they want...
- Encores? Wonderful

01:19:16.161 --> 01:19:19.722
''Encore, encore''

01:19:26.404 --> 01:19:28.736
Hey Dev Babu...

01:19:29.074 --> 01:19:31.065
what's happening?

01:19:31.409 --> 01:19:33.741
What's ailing you?
Have you taken a cure?

01:19:38.483 --> 01:19:40.542
''l'm incurable, Chuni Babu''

01:19:47.359 --> 01:19:52.023
''Then why did you drink, knowing...?
- For friendship's sake, Chuni Babu''

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:58.335
''Friendship? You take me for
a stranger? Not again, not again...''

01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:03.002
''No stranger, Chuni Babu.
You're the closest to me''

01:20:04.676 --> 01:20:10.342
l've even imbibed your metaphor.
The Sunrise of life...

01:20:10.782 --> 01:20:14.946
the salutations...
then the solace...

01:20:16.421 --> 01:20:19.788
''and in seconds, time takes
such a turn Chuni Babu...''

01:20:20.792 --> 01:20:25.229
all ties with life are severed.
- No Dev Babu

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:27.197
The Sun...

01:20:27.532 --> 01:20:31.400
''the song, the serenade,
sympathy between friends''

01:20:31.736 --> 01:20:37.732
''But separation... no...
- lt all ends, Chuni Babu''

01:20:38.076 --> 01:20:39.065
No

01:20:44.516 --> 01:20:48.543
Silence? So deathly?
As if l'm dead already?

01:20:51.256 --> 01:20:53.247
l swear by our friendship...

01:20:54.426 --> 01:20:56.758
this silence...

01:20:57.762 --> 01:20:59.992
is stifling

01:21:01.766 --> 01:21:05.429
''And you know Chuni Babu,
miles to go...''

01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:07.761
before my thirst is quenched

01:21:13.778 --> 01:21:15.769
Oh when will my thirst
be quenched?

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:53.979
What happened to Chhoti-Ma?

01:21:54.452 --> 01:21:55.510
Blood...?

01:22:17.776 --> 01:22:22.770
''Pandua. Passengers to Manikpur,
Mirzapur, Mirgaon, detrain''

01:22:27.819 --> 01:22:31.721
lf serving me makes you happy...

01:22:32.724 --> 01:22:37.957
''l promise you, before l die
l will surely come to your doorstep''

01:22:38.463 --> 01:22:41.159
''Swear that, by me''

01:23:14.766 --> 01:23:15.755
Are we there?

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:19.768
The journey has just begun.
What's wrong with you?

01:23:22.774 --> 01:23:27.370
''Devdas... come to me, my darling''

01:23:37.889 --> 01:23:40.756
All day tramping around the village
with that Paro

01:23:41.092 --> 01:23:43.390
Not another moment
for you in this house

01:23:46.731 --> 01:23:52.727
Deva! l'm not letting you leave!
- Dharamdas! Don't let him go

01:23:54.405 --> 01:23:55.736
Stop Dev

01:24:09.921 --> 01:24:12.947
''Faster, please''

01:24:14.459 --> 01:24:16.256
Very little time left

01:24:16.461 --> 01:24:17.450
Yes sir

01:24:25.403 --> 01:24:29.032
''Babu-ji said leave the village.
Everyone said, leave Paro''

01:24:29.407 --> 01:24:33.935
''Paro said, leave drinking.
Now you say, leave this house''

01:24:34.479 --> 01:24:38.711
''One day, He will say,
leave this world''

01:24:44.722 --> 01:24:49.853
Here's Manikpur.
Brought you in before sun-up

01:24:55.733 --> 01:24:58.258
Whom are you seeing in Manikpur?

01:25:10.882 --> 01:25:12.076
Who...?

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:14.980
''l'm here, Paro''

01:25:47.252 --> 01:25:51.245
''What is the matter, Parvati?
- Someone called out to me''

01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:57.960
So late at night? Go to bed.
You must be mistaken

01:26:10.675 --> 01:26:13.405
Picked him up at Pandua station.
l don't know...

01:26:13.745 --> 01:26:16.270
''something happened to him overnight.
Never said where to, in Manikpur''

01:26:24.689 --> 01:26:28.284
What's that crowd outside?

01:26:28.793 --> 01:26:34.231
''Some stranger has been lying there
all night. Counting his last, maybe''

01:26:34.966 --> 01:26:38.925
''Poor soul, must've come to return
something he owed in this lifetime''

01:26:42.707 --> 01:26:44.698
God rest his soul

01:26:49.647 --> 01:26:52.514
''No chance of survival,
Mahendra Babu''

01:26:53.518 --> 01:26:55.509
He's breathing his last

01:26:59.991 --> 01:27:03.392
She is manifest in Death

01:27:03.728 --> 01:27:07.391
She is the life-force

01:27:34.425 --> 01:27:36.154
''What is the matter, Parvati?''

01:27:40.698 --> 01:27:43.223
These letters might provide a clue

01:27:43.701 --> 01:27:46.693
She is Eternal peace

01:27:50.708 --> 01:27:57.807
''lf you are inattentive Parvati,
you needn't say the prayers. Leave''

01:28:01.586 --> 01:28:05.522
''For some wish unfulfilled, must be,
he isn't giving up his ghost''

01:28:05.857 --> 01:28:10.726
The policeman has identified him.
He's from some Tal Sonapur

01:28:15.299 --> 01:28:17.324
What's the name?
- l don't know

01:28:17.735 --> 01:28:21.432
Mahendra Babu knows.
- Will you please call Mahendra?

01:28:25.543 --> 01:28:27.977
''l said, call Mahendra.
- Yes''

01:28:36.254 --> 01:28:39.690
Yes?
- Chhoti-Ma wants to see you. Now

01:28:54.372 --> 01:28:59.309
''Yes Chhoti-Ma? You summoned me?
- Yes, who's the man lying outside?''

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:02.201
''Someone from your village,
one Devdas Mukherjee''

01:29:05.716 --> 01:29:08.708
Who?
- Devdas Mukherjee

01:29:14.859 --> 01:29:16.850
How do you know?
- Two letters in his pocket

01:29:17.094 --> 01:29:19.085
''One, to Dwijdas Mukherjee.
- His elder brother''

01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:20.727
''And to one Kaushalya.
- Yes, his mother''

01:29:20.865 --> 01:29:23.197
The name was tattooed on his arm.
- At a fair. lt rained

01:29:23.534 --> 01:29:25.468
lncomplete tattoo...
- Also a torn necklace of pearls

01:29:25.803 --> 01:29:27.737
Hit me here...

01:29:34.479 --> 01:29:35.741
Where are you going Chhoti-Ma?

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.871
By now
they must've taken him away

01:29:43.654 --> 01:29:45.747
''Chhoti-Ma, stop...''

01:29:57.468 --> 01:30:00.562
What happened to Chhoti Ma?
- What's going on in this house?

01:30:00.905 --> 01:30:03.305
Why this screaming?
What's up Mahendra?

01:30:03.641 --> 01:30:07.771
''Ma is going out! For some Devdas!
- She has gone insane, stop her''

01:30:08.479 --> 01:30:10.470
''Stop, Parvati!''

01:30:10.882 --> 01:30:13.112
Don't let her step
outside the manor

01:30:43.447 --> 01:30:45.745
Stop Chhoti-Ma

01:30:47.752 --> 01:30:51.552
Stop! Babu-ji forbids you

01:31:09.774 --> 01:31:13.175
Secure the doors

01:32:04.962 --> 01:32:08.159
Where will l find again...

01:32:09.533 --> 01:32:11.524
my lost innocence...

01:32:12.637 --> 01:32:14.434
my lost dreams...

01:32:15.773 --> 01:32:17.764
my lost childhood

01:32:18.776 --> 01:32:21.108
Where is gone the shade of trees...

01:32:21.579 --> 01:32:22.000
where l made myself a home?s
