<i>Previously on "Salem"...</i>

00:02.060 --> 00:04.608
The explosion came from Deerfield.

00:04.633 --> 00:07.545
Every settlement between there
and here is being emptied out,

00:07.570 --> 00:11.050
and the people are coming here for
refuge. So I need to take my men...

00:11.055 --> 00:12.456
Leave us unarmed?

00:12.533 --> 00:15.018
Know what it is? I
know what it can do.

00:15.052 --> 00:17.620
Attend to your next delivery.

00:23.761 --> 00:30.692
You witch! Stay away from me.
I control you now.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.920
Alice Land recently joined a brothel.

00:32.938 --> 00:37.041
I will see to this matter, the
brothel in Salem, myself.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.450
Welcome to my Bird's Nest.

00:38.476 --> 00:41.412
Do you see any birds you'd
like to share a nest with?

00:41.446 --> 00:44.148
Heard you been asking
questions about Mercy Lewis.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.867
There ain't no Mercy Lewis.

00:54.726 --> 00:57.361
I take from you every power I gave.

Cotton?

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
Cotton.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.820
Cotton, time to come home.
Don't be a fool!

01:57.000 --> 02:01.400
You'll die out here.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.500
A man must leave his father and
mother and cleave unto his wife...

02:06.000 --> 02:09.600
I want you, Cotton. My thighs are aching for
your weight. I want to feel you inside me again.

02:10.068 --> 02:12.268
Why must you hurt me? All the
things I will do for you.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.530
Things no woman has ever
done, or let you do.

02:14.530 --> 02:16.898
I will make us no longer two...
but one flesh.

02:16.941 --> 02:19.741
What God has joined together
let no man split apart.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.677
That's what they'll do
when they catch you!

02:21.700 --> 02:22.700
Split you in...

02:23.014 --> 02:25.449
two... I'm too alone without...

02:25.450 --> 02:27.950
you... I need you. Love you.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.500
Destroy you. So
disappointed in you...

02:29.754 --> 02:33.157
Anything you want. Nothing!

02:33.160 --> 02:34.960
I want nothing from you!

02:35.000 --> 02:37.134
But there is nowhere for you to go.

02:37.262 --> 02:40.164
Boston!

02:40.198 --> 02:43.398
I will tell them the awful truth about
Salem, and they will raze this town!

02:43.768 --> 02:47.068
Tell them everything? Then they will
hang you for the murder of your father.

02:47.372 --> 02:51.408
So, let them hang me. So
long as they believe me.

02:51.443 --> 02:54.945
I will tell them all!
Cotton, no!

03:00.200 --> 03:06.773
Searching for something? A
missing husband, perhaps?

03:09.127 --> 03:13.017
I've given him some
freedom to stretch

03:13.568 --> 03:15.868
his legs. His legs
will be stretched.

03:15.967 --> 03:19.937
And broken on the rack
once our Dark Lord catches up to him.

03:19.971 --> 03:23.107
But, Dear Sister...

03:23.141 --> 03:26.443
the Dark Lord told us to
look after one another.

03:26.478 --> 03:28.746
And I can help you.

03:28.780 --> 03:30.881
We can help each other.

03:31.116 --> 03:33.083
What do you want?

03:33.118 --> 03:35.352
Tell me what happened to Mary.

03:35.386 --> 03:38.789
You were there.

03:38.823 --> 03:42.673
He wrenched from her all the powers

03:42.961 --> 03:48.499
he had granted her, as if he
was turning her inside out.

03:48.533 --> 03:51.101
I do not know how she survived it.

03:51.136 --> 03:57.674
But she did? She did survive.

03:57.709 --> 04:04.915
That is something at least.
Why do you care so much?

04:09.120 --> 04:14.658
I love her. Then you're a fool.

04:14.692 --> 04:20.531
Love makes fools of us
all, as you now see.

04:22.834 --> 04:25.602
Wait. You said you would help me.

04:25.637 --> 04:29.940
Dear Sister, I will help you. I
will tell the Dark Lord everything.

04:30.375 --> 04:33.277
You have no hope on your own
of catching your husband.

04:33.311 --> 04:38.615
If Cotton makes it alive to Boston, either the Dark
Lord will kill us, or the Puritans will burn us.

06:37.414 --> 06:40.516
I could have killed you,

06:40.551 --> 06:45.021
or wiped your memory and
left you a blank slate.

06:45.055 --> 06:48.524
But then you wouldn't have
remembered who I am...

06:48.559 --> 06:52.962
your son. I remember you.

06:52.997 --> 06:55.732
And I hate you.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.501
Good.

06:59.536 --> 07:02.405
Hate is just a shadow of love.

07:02.439 --> 07:06.109
Where there is one, the
other is sure to follow,

07:06.143 --> 07:10.246
and there is nothing more
powerful than the two combined.

If it were any other man proclaiming from the rooftops
that the Devil had come to Earth, they'd laugh.

07:54.825 --> 07:57.193
Speak of mass panics or
delusion of fanatics...

07:57.227 --> 08:00.863
This is not any other man. This is
Cotton Mather. He will be believed.

08:00.898 --> 08:04.300
I wasn't the one sitting next to
him when he drowned my familiar!

08:04.335 --> 08:06.369
If Cotton makes it to Boston

08:06.403 --> 08:10.006
and tells the truth about Salem we shall
be surrounded by troops and cannons.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.343
Let them come. No army
of mere men can take us.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.677
No!

08:14.712 --> 08:18.014
I will have things as I
wish them, or all will pay.

08:18.048 --> 08:20.650
Especially you.

08:20.684 --> 08:23.653
So, your Cotton will not
make it to Boston. Will he?

08:23.687 --> 08:26.356
No, My Lord. I promise.

08:26.390 --> 08:29.025
He's miles to Boston.

08:29.059 --> 08:32.729
Miles of dark woods filled
with Injuns and beasts

08:32.763 --> 08:34.263
and witches.

08:34.298 --> 08:37.000
Yes... night's Black Agents.

08:37.034 --> 08:39.135
And we will call on friends in Boston.

08:39.169 --> 08:42.371
His door shall be watched,
and the North Church, too.

08:42.405 --> 08:46.209
Every shadow 'cross every road into
Boston shall hold one of our own.

08:46.243 --> 08:51.047
Announced the ears that I give good
reward to anyone who found him...

08:51.081 --> 08:54.550
and such pain for you should they fail.

09:36.946 --> 09:42.450
What astonishing powers you have.

09:45.888 --> 09:48.256
What have you done to me?

09:50.225 --> 09:54.596
Only reminded you that
we need not strain

09:54.630 --> 09:57.599
for a far-off Heaven when our bodies

09:57.633 --> 10:00.768
may take us there here on Earth.

10:00.803 --> 10:02.971
You are wise beyond your age.

10:04.573 --> 10:09.377
We may fashion ourselves
whatever we aspire to.

10:09.411 --> 10:12.480
We can become anything.

10:12.514 --> 10:17.852
We might even fashion ourselves
into the rulers of Salem.

10:28.964 --> 10:33.301
But I am pressed and
pulled from all sides.

10:33.335 --> 10:36.938
As Magistrate...

10:36.972 --> 10:40.041
and head of the Selectmen...

10:42.077 --> 10:45.847
I must try and obey the designs of those

10:45.881 --> 10:51.486
whose fortunes we need to
build this town into a city.

10:51.520 --> 10:57.091
While keeping the love,
or at least the votes,

10:57.126 --> 11:03.931
of those who still must
earn their livelihood.

11:03.966 --> 11:09.771
This refugee crisis
which divides us all...

11:09.805 --> 11:12.373
is my curse.

11:12.408 --> 11:16.077
But every curse contains a blessing,

11:16.111 --> 11:19.781
as every blessing contains a curse.

11:19.815 --> 11:24.485
For example, there are sure to be many

11:24.620 --> 11:28.823
poor, lost birds among these refugees...

11:28.857 --> 11:35.396
birds in desperate need of our nest.

11:40.903 --> 11:46.941
Girl? Are you in here? Hello?

11:49.812 --> 11:51.813
What are you doing down there?

11:54.316 --> 11:59.387
All the shouting and fighting outside...

11:59.421 --> 12:01.589
I was afraid.

12:02.926 --> 12:05.027
Okay.

12:10.599 --> 12:13.768
It's a lot of cold and
hungry people out there.

12:13.802 --> 12:20.241
But... I'm here. It's safe now.

12:23.746 --> 12:26.114
And I can't just keep calling you girl.

12:26.148 --> 12:32.854
What's your name? Dorcas.

12:35.858 --> 12:38.526
I brought you this, Dorcas.

12:44.266 --> 12:47.435
My mother's shawl was soft like this.

12:50.773 --> 12:54.109
Where is your mother?

12:54.260 --> 13:00.014
She got sick... while
we were in the jail.

13:00.048 --> 13:03.951
You were in jail?

13:06.688 --> 13:10.458
A neighbor said we were witches.

13:10.492 --> 13:15.863
My mother said if that was
true, we wouldn't be so poor.

13:15.898 --> 13:19.100
But no one believes us.

13:19.134 --> 13:22.403
They thought even you was a witch?

13:22.437 --> 13:27.241
I was chained to a wall.

13:27.276 --> 13:32.046
I couldn't even touch her as she died.

13:36.852 --> 13:40.288
They chained a little girl to a wall.

13:40.322 --> 13:44.892
So many innocents died...

13:44.927 --> 13:46.661
like Dollie...

13:48.397 --> 13:52.567
while real witches walked
free and still do.

13:56.104 --> 13:59.173
If only I could get one in my hands,

13:59.208 --> 14:02.810
and I know which one I want... Mercy.

14:02.845 --> 14:09.550
Would that bring Mama back?
Or Dollie?

14:09.585 --> 14:13.554
Don't suppose it would.

14:13.589 --> 14:16.424
But what else can I do?

14:16.458 --> 14:21.329
Make sure there are no more Dollies.

14:23.432 --> 14:26.500
I believe I have a notion.

14:33.275 --> 14:36.644
You are even more
beautiful in your misery.

14:40.215 --> 14:43.684
Be thine own palace, or
the world's thy jail.

14:43.719 --> 14:46.473
That's a true

14:46.624 --> 14:51.425
one. Come, Mary. You may step
out of your jail anytime.

14:51.460 --> 14:54.629
It is but your mood.
Please stop.

14:54.663 --> 14:56.731
I thought you rather liked poetry.

14:56.765 --> 15:02.036
I once loved poetry, but
now it hurts my ears...

15:02.070 --> 15:04.538
to hear of things I
will never know again.

15:04.573 --> 15:08.930
Such as? Love.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.100
I am two fools, I know.

15:13.115 --> 15:17.852
For loving, and for saying so.

15:17.886 --> 15:20.888
Have you ever considered
that the love you think

15:20.923 --> 15:23.858
you have lost was never worth pursuing?

15:24.592 --> 15:28.029
I know how you feel about John Alden,

15:28.063 --> 15:32.133
but he will simply never be
your equal. And you know it.

15:32.167 --> 15:35.403
Love is a conversation.

15:35.437 --> 15:39.040
You cannot deny, our
words mingle as free

15:39.074 --> 15:42.743
and equally as our lips
might, if you but let them.

15:42.778 --> 15:46.414
You think John Alden is the man
who stands between you and I?

15:46.590 --> 15:48.590
If not Alden, who then?

15:48.917 --> 15:52.086
You know very well... my son.

15:54.623 --> 15:57.224
Now, I want to be alone
with my thoughts.

16:00.028 --> 16:04.265
Very well... but have a care.

16:04.299 --> 16:08.469
You are without magic, in a
house full of dark secrets.

17:30.285 --> 17:35.923
Mr. Stoughton. Is it really you?

17:35.957 --> 17:39.593
Cotton? Cotton Mather?
Don't be daft.

17:39.628 --> 17:41.708
What would Cotton Mather be
doing in the middle of...

17:43.031 --> 17:45.866
Age of Miracles! It is.

17:45.901 --> 17:50.704
Why, Cotton, we haven't seen you
since your graduation party.

17:50.739 --> 17:53.374
And what a party it was.
Do you remember, Will?

17:53.408 --> 17:55.953
Aye, how could I forget? Cambridge
never saw such a spread.

17:55.977 --> 17:59.046
Mr. and Mrs. Stoughton, please.
Do you have room for one more?

17:59.081 --> 18:02.383
Room for the son of Increase Mather?

18:02.417 --> 18:04.618
Why, what kind of Puritans
would we be if we didn't?

18:09.257 --> 18:12.560
Just what were you doing in the
road way out here, Cotton?

18:12.594 --> 18:15.563
I have urgent business in Boston.

18:15.597 --> 18:19.767
Boston. Providential, indeed.
Precisely our destination.

18:19.801 --> 18:23.571
You are hardly dressed for business,
Cotton. Urgent or otherwise.

18:23.605 --> 18:25.072
I can explain. I, um...

18:25.107 --> 18:27.341
Are you back on the bottle, son?

18:29.144 --> 18:33.747
No need to be shy. Everyone in
Cambridge knew of your struggle.

18:33.782 --> 18:37.551
Indeed. Salem is too full
of temptations for me.

18:37.586 --> 18:40.888
In Boston, I may restore myself.

18:40.922 --> 18:45.293
Well, God loves no man more
than a repentant sinner.

18:45.527 --> 18:47.795
Prodigal sons and all that.

18:47.829 --> 18:54.171
And if God has seen fit to deliver you into 
our hands that we may carry you home...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.885
the blessing is all ours.

19:00.242 --> 19:04.145
Too true, my dear. All ours.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.632
It's clear where your
interests lie, Hathorne.

19:17.850 --> 19:22.220
You dance to the tune of the Mansion, while
you protect filthy thieves and beggars

19:22.254 --> 19:26.424
instead of those who work hard,
pray hard, and get nothing.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.927
You've not done nothing since the
attack on Deerfield to make us safer.

19:29.962 --> 19:34.732
I think of nothing all day
and night but protecting us.

19:34.766 --> 19:39.864
Even now our foremost Indian fighter,
John Alden himself, tracks our enemies.

19:39.889 --> 19:42.257
John Alden? Where is he?

19:42.312 --> 19:45.114
Either slaughtered or
fled to save himself.

19:45.139 --> 19:49.400
Seriously, Hathorne, I don't know if it's merely
sheer incompetence or outright malevolence

19:49.425 --> 19:52.928
that make you such a... such
an abject failure as a leader.

20:01.126 --> 20:03.828
Who protects us from the
French and the Indians?

20:03.862 --> 20:05.096
Hathorne!

20:05.130 --> 20:07.265
Who leads the rebuilding of our church?

20:07.299 --> 20:11.269
- Hathorne! - Nonsense. Putnam.

20:11.303 --> 20:16.340
What kind of name is that anyway?
Sounds French.

20:17.175 --> 20:20.211
Three cheers for Hathorne!

20:20.245 --> 20:24.649
Hathorne! Hathorne! Hathorne!

20:41.967 --> 20:46.904
It's far too cold and dangerous to
spend the night on the streets.

20:46.939 --> 20:51.309
Especially for such a pretty girl.

20:51.343 --> 20:55.546
I'll take you to my little nest.
Follow me.

21:06.992 --> 21:11.963
Where am I? You're in my
cozy kingdom... my kitchen.

21:11.997 --> 21:14.699
Hearth and home, dear Cotton...
hearth and home.

21:15.901 --> 21:20.171
Patience, Little Lady.
You'll have to wait for the leftovers.

21:22.007 --> 21:26.844
He don't understand the speech
of animals. Speech of animals?

21:30.349 --> 21:32.216
The little darling.

21:32.250 --> 21:36.620
She says she's just been biting your
father's burning balls in Hell.

21:36.655 --> 21:41.792
What?! No. No, not you.

21:41.827 --> 21:46.530
You two are witches. And that
little thing is your familiar?

21:46.565 --> 21:50.501
Of course. And the very best.
<i>Who's the very best?</i>

21:50.535 --> 21:52.136
- Who's the very, very best?
- God, please!

21:52.170 --> 21:55.006
There will be no talk
of Him in this house.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.608
That being said, our prayers
have been answered.

21:57.642 --> 22:00.344
Praise the Dark Lord.
Praise his unholy name.

22:00.379 --> 22:03.448
But you attended my father's
sermons faithfully.

22:03.450 --> 22:06.152
Fine words your father always spoke.
Fine words.

22:06.218 --> 22:09.187
But then we moved to the
country and began to farm.

22:09.321 --> 22:13.324
Soon we learned the dark secrets
that working the land brings.

22:13.759 --> 22:16.460
Your father's sermons
were fine for city folk,

22:16.495 --> 22:21.132
but once you dedicate yourself to reaping and
sowing, it's the voice of the moon you hear.

22:21.166 --> 22:22.566
And it tells a different tale.

22:22.601 --> 22:25.870
Once we made our pact,
our grain grew high.

22:25.904 --> 22:28.172
Our traps were always filled.

22:28.206 --> 22:31.509
Your god is nothing but words.
Ours don't muck about.

22:31.543 --> 22:33.277
He gives us what we want.

22:33.311 --> 22:37.348
And now, finally we
have a gift for him...

22:37.382 --> 22:39.183
a gift fit for the king.

22:39.217 --> 22:40.951
I beg of you. Please. No.

22:42.988 --> 22:46.023
We have been promised such great reward!

22:47.092 --> 22:52.230
But, you know, William, it occurs to
me that the reward might climb higher.

22:52.264 --> 22:53.565
How is that, Dear?

22:53.799 --> 22:59.303
Well, if the Dark Lord is offering a great
reward now, how much greater a reward

22:59.337 --> 23:03.140
will he offer later when
none have found Mather?

23:03.175 --> 23:04.608
But we have found him.

23:06.945 --> 23:10.314
So, why not let the Dark
Lord fret a little longer...

23:10.324 --> 23:13.727
and perhaps sweeten the
reward for his return?

23:16.221 --> 23:18.722
Haven't I the cleverest of all wives?

23:21.159 --> 23:25.930
But now, it will seem suspicious if we are
not seen to be still searching for Mather.

23:25.964 --> 23:29.200
So you must go rejoin the
hunt and pretend to search

23:29.234 --> 23:34.405
and wait some time before coming back. And
by then I will have Cotton all ready!

23:34.439 --> 23:36.173
Come here.

23:39.511 --> 23:42.279
Off with you.

23:52.824 --> 23:55.025
Now...

24:03.068 --> 24:06.370
My work here is never done.

24:15.714 --> 24:19.016
Nothing from nothing ever yet was born.

24:19.050 --> 24:22.720
But all from all may yet be torn.

24:25.123 --> 24:29.760
In each resides a secret power.

24:29.794 --> 24:34.331
That sleeping yet awaits its hour.

24:53.285 --> 25:00.925
<i>Mary Sibley. <b>Mary</b>. 
Save us. Save us.</i>

25:00.959 --> 25:03.928
<i>Save us. Save us.</i>

25:07.032 --> 25:10.034
More stones. Stones. More stones.

25:10.569 --> 25:12.939
<i>Spare us! 
<b>I am innocent.</b></i>

25:13.071 --> 25:17.108
<i>No more witch than you. 
Save us!</i>

25:17.742 --> 25:21.813
<i>Save us! More stones.
Save us. More stones.</i>

25:22.447 --> 25:27.682
<i><b>Men crushed beneath stones.</b>
Innocents,</i>

25:27.907 --> 25:32.644
whole families even,
murdered as witches.

25:32.891 --> 25:37.494
<i>And how many died from the
plague you spread, Mary Sibley?</i>

25:37.529 --> 25:39.530
Who is there?

25:39.564 --> 25:42.864
<i><b>Have you forgotten me, Mary Sibley?</b></i>

25:43.068 --> 25:45.636
<i><b>I have not forgotten you.</b></i>

25:45.770 --> 25:48.372
<i><b>Look behind you.</b></i>

25:49.809 --> 25:55.080
Remember me now? I
am Rebecca Nurse.

25:56.314 --> 26:01.452
Just one of many innocents
killed as witches by witches.

26:01.486 --> 26:05.923
I gave my every waking
hour to help the poor.

26:05.957 --> 26:09.927
Even raising their children when
they couldn't afford to keep them.

26:09.961 --> 26:15.099
And my reward? You had
me hanged as a witch.

26:15.133 --> 26:17.301
Leave me be!

26:17.636 --> 26:20.905
It was... It was not my fault.
I had no choice.

26:21.439 --> 26:26.577
You always had a choice.
You still have a choice.

26:29.948 --> 26:33.284
You, who never felt
for any of your victims,

26:33.318 --> 26:36.520
now feel what I felt.

26:38.456 --> 26:45.462
Abandoned by all, even by God, and
hanging from the neck until dead.

26:51.369 --> 26:55.639
Memory... the
greatest curse of all.

26:55.674 --> 26:58.309
I, being what I am, can
never escape mine,

26:58.343 --> 27:00.144
but you can.

27:00.178 --> 27:04.248
Would you escape the horrors
of your past, Mary Sibley?

27:05.264 --> 27:06.564
Come.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.188
Let me show you the way.

27:18.046 --> 27:21.916
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not here
for that. I'm not here for that.

27:21.950 --> 27:23.951
Or for that, either.

27:23.986 --> 27:27.455
Go get your things. I'm
here to rescue you.

27:27.489 --> 27:30.224
Mercy's already rescued us.

27:30.259 --> 27:34.462
She hasn't rescued you. She's
turned you all into whores.

27:34.496 --> 27:39.567
My uncle turned me into a whore. At least with
Mercy, I get to keep some of my earnings.

27:39.601 --> 27:43.137
That's because she wants something else.

27:43.171 --> 27:48.609
You don't know the things she's done.
She wants your blood.

27:50.846 --> 27:55.850
Mercy takes a cup of our blood.
Men take all of it.

28:01.023 --> 28:03.791
Come.

28:03.825 --> 28:07.562
The girls here aren't the ones in cages.

28:07.596 --> 28:10.865
The men are, especially
the ones who serve her.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.568
They got no choice but to obey.

28:16.538 --> 28:19.840
She keeps their manhoods
locked up in her room.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.184
Hello. Come here.

28:32.554 --> 28:36.390
Hello, gentlemen. Sit down. Sit.

28:36.425 --> 28:38.292
Plethora of choices.

28:38.326 --> 28:42.163
Bevy of beauties before me.

29:47.562 --> 29:52.700
Then there was the time John Alden,
single-handed, took out an Abenaki camp.

29:52.734 --> 29:56.604
Killed 12 braves with his bare
hands and freed the hostages.

29:56.638 --> 30:00.307
Even a frog-eating, blue
coat Frenchie like you

30:00.342 --> 30:03.477
must have heard of that one.
Alden, Alden, Alden.

30:08.350 --> 30:14.522
Okay, English. 
Who is this legendary John Alden?

30:17.025 --> 30:19.226
I am.

30:41.983 --> 30:45.052
Mather remains at large, I'm afraid.

30:45.087 --> 30:48.255
How disappointing.

30:48.290 --> 30:51.959
I dearly wanted him alive.

30:54.362 --> 30:58.499
Now, I suppose I have no choice.

31:26.461 --> 31:27.828
Please, stop.

31:27.863 --> 31:30.898
Think of what you're about to do.

31:30.932 --> 31:35.002
It's not too late. It's
never too late to repent.

31:35.036 --> 31:39.073
God is most forgiving. Well,
if it was up to your God,

31:39.407 --> 31:43.711
we would all be naked and
ignorant in wretched Eden.

31:45.814 --> 31:49.917
Who clothed us? Who taught
us to till the soil?

31:50.452 --> 31:56.323
Who gave us the gift of fire that transforms
animals into meat and grain into bread?

31:56.358 --> 32:00.595
Your God? No. No.

32:00.629 --> 32:04.999
'Twas our Dark Lord and
his Fallen Angels.

32:05.333 --> 32:10.104
It is to them we owe all that we are.

32:10.138 --> 32:14.242
He is coming to claim his kingdom.
And we rejoice.

32:14.776 --> 32:18.831
You risk an eternity of suffering 
in Hell when, with one act

32:18.982 --> 32:22.883
of grace to me, you could
gain an eternity in Heaven!

32:22.918 --> 32:24.685
Please!

32:25.220 --> 32:29.657
I don't want your pie in the sky
when I die. I want my pie now.

32:29.691 --> 32:32.726
And I prefer to have a meat pie.

32:32.761 --> 32:34.595
- No!
- Stop, my dear!

32:34.629 --> 32:39.333
Our Dark Lord wants him greatly...
Just as I foresaw.

32:39.367 --> 32:41.735
But he insists on having him alive.

32:41.770 --> 32:45.739
Alive? But he will
taste horrid alive.

32:45.774 --> 32:47.908
I'm not sure he intends on eating him.

32:47.943 --> 32:50.511
Not eat him? Nonsense.

32:50.545 --> 32:54.748
Surely as soon as the Dark Lord tastes
my dish, he will give us even more!

32:54.783 --> 32:58.519
Very risky, my dear. Very risky.

32:58.553 --> 33:01.989
William, are you questioning my cooking?

33:02.023 --> 33:04.658
Of course not, but we
mustn't risk angering him.

33:04.693 --> 33:06.794
You saw what he did to that Essex hag.

33:06.828 --> 33:08.656
- Are you calling me a hag now?
- Did I say hag?

33:08.807 --> 33:10.898
- Yes, you said hag. 
- I did not say hag. No, no.

33:11.133 --> 33:14.535
I would never call you a crone or a hag. 
- William, I can't take this anymore.

33:14.569 --> 33:16.604
William!

33:18.306 --> 33:20.574
No!

34:24.172 --> 34:28.775
If you would live...
come. I know you.

34:28.810 --> 34:33.047
- You are a witch. - Whatever I be, if I
served him... would I have saved you?

34:35.183 --> 34:37.318
Come.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.329
Be not afraid.

34:48.362 --> 34:51.532
I know the horrors behind you.

34:51.565 --> 34:54.201
And I know all too well the horrors

34:54.235 --> 34:57.271
that lie in front of you.

34:57.305 --> 35:01.608
And I would spare you all to come.

35:01.643 --> 35:05.946
The horrors haven't half begun.

35:05.981 --> 35:09.249
Everyone you ever knew

35:09.284 --> 35:16.357
or loved will die... horribly.

35:16.391 --> 35:20.260
And all... all because of you.

35:22.931 --> 35:29.503
There is another way...
a sweet, swift way.

35:29.537 --> 35:33.340
I once stood as close to
God as I stand to you now.

35:33.375 --> 35:37.011
I knew him well. 
He loves nothing more

35:37.045 --> 35:40.080
than to forgive those
willing to beg him.

35:40.115 --> 35:42.750
Could I but step back in
time and beg, I would.

35:42.784 --> 35:47.554
I cannot, but you can.

35:47.589 --> 35:50.424
Loving arms await you

35:50.458 --> 35:54.595
to enclose you in his cloudy breast

35:54.629 --> 35:57.765
and wipe all the horrors
from your heart.

35:57.799 --> 36:02.269
It will be so easy.

36:02.303 --> 36:05.372
Just one small step.

36:06.674 --> 36:13.747
Do it, Mary. Do it! I can't.

36:13.782 --> 36:18.085
- Jump. - No. No.

36:18.119 --> 36:20.954
I would go straight to Hell.

36:20.989 --> 36:23.757
I know exactly what
punishments await me there,

36:23.792 --> 36:26.660
and they are far worse
even than what I feel now.

36:26.694 --> 36:32.332
No, silly child! 
Don't you see?

36:32.367 --> 36:35.169
Your son has freed you.

36:35.203 --> 36:37.438
A contract you could never break

36:37.472 --> 36:39.606
has been broken by the
only one that could.

36:39.641 --> 36:43.911
You're no longer destined for Hell.

36:43.945 --> 36:48.582
Free. Yes, utterly free.

36:48.616 --> 36:52.853
Free to escape it all.
It'll be so easy.

36:52.887 --> 37:02.897
Just one... small...
step. I'm afraid.

37:03.531 --> 37:11.405
Help me. You do it. 
<b>Push me.</b>

37:14.776 --> 37:16.376
<b>Push me.</b>

37:17.846 --> 37:23.183
You can't. 
You can't.

37:24.953 --> 37:27.955
The Dark Lord forbade you
from ever harming me.

37:27.989 --> 37:31.458
Or even now, I would be
falling into eternity,

37:31.493 --> 37:34.128
or onto the Salem common.

37:34.162 --> 37:36.530
Well, I'll not do your
dirty work for you.

37:36.564 --> 37:40.834
No. Not now. 
I <b>thank</b> you.

37:40.869 --> 37:43.303
<b>Thank</b> you for helping me see.

37:43.338 --> 37:47.307
I do have a choice, unlike you.

37:47.342 --> 37:52.346
Is that why you hate us so,
because God created us to be free?

37:52.380 --> 37:56.683
Because he was tired of being
surrounded by puppets like you.

37:56.718 --> 38:00.854
I'm no puppet! I fought.
I rebelled.

38:00.889 --> 38:05.792
I am free! Then act now...
freely.

38:05.827 --> 38:12.551
Disobey my son.

38:12.702 --> 38:18.155
Free? 
Hardly.

38:18.339 --> 38:21.141
You just found somebody
else to pull your strings.

38:31.358 --> 38:35.995
You are out of danger... for the moment.

38:36.029 --> 38:40.266
- What do you want? 
- The question is what do you want?

38:40.300 --> 38:42.835
I want to make it to Boston.

38:42.870 --> 38:47.565
I want to expose this foul witch cult
and their Devil who rules from Salem.

38:47.651 --> 38:52.288
I can send you there in an
instant, but to what end?

38:52.322 --> 38:56.826
Their army... the world's
army cannot stop him.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.095
Then what would you have me do?

38:59.129 --> 39:04.834
<i>You can stop him.</i>
That's madness.

39:04.868 --> 39:07.703
What could I possibly
do that an army cannot?

39:07.738 --> 39:10.373
Your love may conquer all.

39:10.407 --> 39:14.844
There is no one left
in Salem that I love.

39:14.878 --> 39:20.116
Not yet. Your love still sleeps,

39:20.150 --> 39:23.219
like we all once slept
in our mother's womb.

39:25.789 --> 39:30.793
A child? <i>My child?</i>

39:30.827 --> 39:34.664
I can see its little heart beating

39:34.698 --> 39:38.834
deep in its mother's inner ocean.

39:38.869 --> 39:42.538
Prove it. Prove it?

39:42.573 --> 39:47.810
I know you, Mather... your
past, present, and future.

39:47.844 --> 39:54.584
You who once told a young woman
that love is a leap of faith.

39:54.618 --> 40:00.323
With my skills, that door can
take you anywhere you wish.

40:00.357 --> 40:06.429
Just step through it, and there you
are. Boston, if that's what you want.

40:06.463 --> 40:10.566
But let me assure you, if
you abandon Salem now,

40:10.601 --> 40:13.536
you will never see that baby alive.

40:17.941 --> 40:22.314
Is it failure, or
is it betrayal?

40:22.465 --> 40:26.966
In the end, there
is no difference.

40:30.854 --> 40:34.390
Though virgin no longer,
virgin heart still.

40:34.424 --> 40:39.495
Unspoiled, and more
importantly, more impotently,

40:39.529 --> 40:40.997
unbroken.

40:43.266 --> 40:46.736
So, unbroken skin seeks to be opened.

40:46.770 --> 40:50.039
Let me write my name in your blood.

41:00.250 --> 41:04.578
All right, friend.
Time to go a-courting.

41:04.603 --> 41:09.725
Who do you work for? The
King of France, idiot.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.694
And Baron Sebastian Marburg?

41:21.772 --> 41:27.109
What is this? No, no. No, no.

41:27.144 --> 41:33.282
No, no, no. All right, stop.
You'll blow us all to hell.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.587
Is this how you blew up Deerfield?

41:40.257 --> 41:45.661
What's next? Salem? Hear that?

41:45.696 --> 41:48.197
What? Hear what?

41:49.766 --> 41:51.000
That.

42:10.087 --> 42:12.855
How did I come to be here?

42:12.896 --> 42:15.432
I have no power to send myself anywhere.

42:15.859 --> 42:18.928
We feared you
wouldn't survive your Reckoning.

42:18.962 --> 42:21.630
And when you did,

42:21.665 --> 42:26.769
that your spirit and mind would
be broken beyond repair.

42:26.803 --> 42:28.971
So we have rescued you.

42:29.005 --> 42:32.942
It is not something we
will ever manage again.

42:32.976 --> 42:36.011
We shall care for you,

42:36.046 --> 42:39.148
hide you here amongst us.

42:42.719 --> 42:48.457
There is no shame in
failure, Mary Sibley.

42:48.492 --> 42:53.028
Well, thank you, Mothers.
But no.

42:53.063 --> 42:55.231
No, I have not failed. He has.

42:55.265 --> 42:59.602
He has made a terrible mistake. He should
have killed me when he had the chance.

42:59.636 --> 43:01.737
Instead, he freed me.

43:01.772 --> 43:05.574
Now send me back. You are right.

43:05.609 --> 43:08.677
I couldn't have demanded it
if you hadn't the strength,

43:08.712 --> 43:13.682
but you do. You are you again...

43:13.717 --> 43:17.653
the strongest of us all.

43:17.687 --> 43:20.122
And not a moment too soon.

43:20.157 --> 43:23.659
They are winning.
The tree is dying,

43:23.693 --> 43:29.165
and with it will die you
and us and all our world.

43:29.199 --> 43:34.003
Well, they picked the wrong
witch and the wrong woman.

43:34.037 --> 43:36.438
I shall prove to them that, truly,

43:36.473 --> 43:39.909
Hell hath no fury like
this woman scorned.
