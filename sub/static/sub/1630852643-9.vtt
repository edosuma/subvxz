WEBVTT

00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.104
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.738
Oh, boy! This is gonna be great.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.907
-Come on, everyone.
-Yeah.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.617
Look at this.

01:15.701 --> 01:20.289
Craggles, Fraggles mixing,
sharing, connecting.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.999
I love connecting!

01:23.083 --> 01:25.627
Look at you Craggles meditate.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.922
I thought I went deep, but you go deep.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.843
I hope everyone else
is showing their Craggles a good time.

01:33.927 --> 01:38.473
Hope you Craggles like to be amazed,
because I am going to do

01:38.557 --> 01:43.979
a one-handed upsy doozy gravity bloozy
with my eyes closed.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.481
And the crowd goes wild!

01:46.565 --> 01:49.401
Here we go. And flop.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.784
Wow. A yawn?

01:57.868 --> 02:02.247
Usually, that at least gets
an applause, but okay. Noted.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.750
Unbelievable, but noted.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.127
Right this way, Craggles.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.755
We are gonna do
something really, really fun.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.298
Uh-oh, this way.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.717
Actually-- Well, maybe--

02:13.800 --> 02:14.801
'Cause I--

02:16.845 --> 02:18.472
You know what? I think we should--

02:21.475 --> 02:24.144
Okay, I can't decide what to do.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.941
You ever wish you could just
parachute outside your body and be like,

02:29.024 --> 02:30.400
"You're on your own, pal."

02:31.151 --> 02:33.820
That way? Yeah, okay. Makes sense.

02:34.905 --> 02:38.116
You, my special guests,
are in for a treat.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.286
Oh, to be you right now.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.747
Fresh laundry.

02:43.830 --> 02:44.831
Really?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.425
I'm going to need a moment.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.428
Thank you.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.141
Hey, I know what
you Craggles need, a little snack-a-rooni.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.727
Yeah. You see, our neighbors, the Doozers,

03:05.811 --> 03:08.480
well, we eat their buildings
so they can build more.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.317
Perfect harmony

03:14.111 --> 03:15.821
Anyway. Well, enjoy.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.329
Yeah, well,
they don't usually taste like that.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.873
Must be a bad batch.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.083
Mokey!

03:29.710 --> 03:33.672
See, the Fraggles don't like
that goo in our Doozer sticks.

03:34.173 --> 03:37.926
If they don't eat our structures,
this could be a big problem.

03:38.010 --> 03:41.138
That's why I said to keep the goo
away from headquarters.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.974
Yeah. I'm mad at whoever brought it there.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.310
Turbo, it was you and Wrench.

03:46.393 --> 03:51.023
We know. We feel awful,
but we're working on forgiving ourselves.

03:53.025 --> 03:56.111
-What's up, friend-a-roonies?
-Yeah, hi. Best friend Gobo here.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.906
We're having a hard time
breaking through to the Craggles.

03:58.989 --> 04:03.994
Yeah. They yawned at my one-handed
upsy doozy gravity bloozy!

04:04.077 --> 04:07.456
I mean, I'm-- I'm fine. I don't even care,

04:07.539 --> 04:09.625
-but can you imagine?
-Yeah.

04:09.708 --> 04:13.420
Most people find my indecisiveness cute.
They did not.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.214
They blew their noses in my laundry!

04:16.298 --> 04:19.885
Okay, I'm hearing that this isn't
as easy for some of you

04:19.968 --> 04:22.513
as it is for some of us, like me.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.557
But everything is fine in the vine.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.018
Let me just take the lead here.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.728
I'm a natural connector.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.397
Plus, I've done a little homework.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.817
A book about Craggles?

04:35.901 --> 04:37.569
You read this whole thing?

04:37.653 --> 04:39.988
I read it front to back, back to front.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.908
I laid on my side and read it that way.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.202
High, high recommend.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.913
And as someone who now understands them,

04:47.996 --> 04:51.708
I think we just need to make the Craggles
feel at home and at peace.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.419
I know that you must feel upset

04:55.337 --> 04:58.715
When you try your best
But don't connect

04:59.216 --> 05:02.803
It's never easy
I know that they seem different

05:03.428 --> 05:05.222
But if you just stop

05:05.722 --> 05:08.642
I can guarantee that we're the same

05:08.725 --> 05:12.437
A Fraggle or a Craggle

05:12.521 --> 05:16.650
And hey, even a Grizzard too

05:16.733 --> 05:20.487
You know it doesn't matter

05:20.571 --> 05:22.447
-'Cause the same light shines
-No.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.741
Inside me and you

05:24.825 --> 05:27.244
Pretty soon you'll start to see

05:28.161 --> 05:31.290
All you have in common
If you're listening

05:31.957 --> 05:35.669
It's pretty easy
In no time they'll feel right at home

05:36.336 --> 05:41.216
They'll be eating tons of Doozer sticks
And radishes all on their own

05:41.300 --> 05:45.220
A Fraggle or a Craggle

05:45.304 --> 05:48.432
And hey, even a Grizzard too

05:49.600 --> 05:53.562
You know it doesn't matter

05:53.645 --> 05:57.774
Cause the same light shines
Inside me and you

05:57.858 --> 06:01.820
The same light shines
Inside us all

06:01.904 --> 06:05.866
The same light shines inside us all

06:05.949 --> 06:09.953
From very small to big and tall

06:10.037 --> 06:15.167
The same light shines inside us all

06:15.250 --> 06:16.376
Yeah.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.920
Inside us all

06:21.173 --> 06:23.425
Mokey, nice song.

06:23.509 --> 06:26.094
Great voice. Sweet message.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.096
Lyle, my guyle.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.934
What's craggle-laggle-lagging?

06:34.228 --> 06:37.856
You know our traditional greeting.
Hey, I am impressed.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.609
Well, you know, I do what I can.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.028
Any update on the water situation?

06:43.612 --> 06:45.572
You mean how we stole your water?

06:45.656 --> 06:47.366
By accident. By accident.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.285
Don't worry, friends.
The Wisest Fraggle Council's on it.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.371
They're the greatest minds
in Fraggle Rock.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.706
I bet they're coming up
with a solution right now.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.542
Yes.

06:57.209 --> 07:02.089
Okay then, esteemed council,
I think we've found a solution.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.882
-Oh, yes?
-Finally.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.969
We'll have a snack now and lunch later.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.763
-Excellent!
-Yes. Yes.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.474
That took all morning.

07:12.558 --> 07:16.854
Sir, we're supposed to be solving
the Craggles' water problem.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.107
-Oh, right.
-Oh, yes. We must do that, yes.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.109
Right after lunch!

07:22.192 --> 07:23.235
-Yes!
-Good idea!

07:23.318 --> 07:24.528
A big one.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.947
I wouldn't be surprised
if they've figured it out.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.657
Yes, they're working overtime.

07:28.740 --> 07:33.829
And in the meantime,
we're gonna be playing overtime with you.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.455
It's too much.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.624
Maybe we could just go rest?

07:37.708 --> 07:39.251
No, it's our pleasure.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.337
You're our guest,
and you deserve the best,

07:42.421 --> 07:45.924
and we'd love you to-- I can't think
of another thing that rhymes.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.509
-Rest?
-Rest!

07:47.593 --> 07:48.677
Yes.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.723
But no, because I've got
something special planned.

07:53.307 --> 07:57.561
So, go and round up your crew
and get ready for the best time ever.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.980
-All right.
-Go ahead. See you later.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.232
Get excited.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.651
Mokey, I think the Craggles just want to--

08:04.735 --> 08:07.029
Connect with us
through the magic of games?

08:07.112 --> 08:09.615
I know.
I was just thinking the same thing.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.825
No. I think what Gobo was going to sug--

08:11.909 --> 08:14.828
Did you say games? I'm in.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.416
What? I love games. You know this.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.210
Yes, my sister!

08:21.293 --> 08:25.923
There's a whole chapter in the book
about how much the Craggles love games,

08:26.006 --> 08:29.301
and there's no better way to bond
with them than a shared ritual.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.344
Yes!

08:31.303 --> 08:34.389
Right in my ear,
and I mean right in my ear.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.682
I'm sorry, Boober.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.726
So, let's bond all the way.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.812
Let's play the game to end all games.

08:40.895 --> 08:44.399
Wait,
are you saying what I think you're saying?

08:44.483 --> 08:48.153
-The Giggle Gaggle Games!
-Yeah!

08:48.237 --> 08:49.571
Yeah!

08:49.655 --> 08:52.241
Mokey,
isn't that kind of a big production?

08:52.324 --> 08:53.659
No, not really.

08:53.742 --> 08:54.743
Wow.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.371
I'm Barry Blueberry.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.289
Welcome to the Giggle Gaggle Games.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.712
Okay, so it's not not a big production.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.132
Hi, Mrs. Shimmelfinney.

09:09.675 --> 09:13.512
No, ma'am, I'm not a telemarketer.
I'm your tenant. I live in your backhouse.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.806
Sprocket. I'm on the phone.

09:16.348 --> 09:19.268
I'm calling to ask
if I could put solar panels on the roof

09:19.351 --> 09:20.686
to draw some extra power

09:20.769 --> 09:25.357
for a pretty exciting project
I'm working on to remediate plastics.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.986
Oh, no, I know that recycling
goes out on Thursdays.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.488
I'm actually talking about microplastics.

09:32.865 --> 09:36.660
It's a project for school. No,
not high school, 'cause I'm a big girl.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.203
No, I'm a woman girl.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.789
-No, I mean-- Hello?
-Hello?

09:40.873 --> 09:43.333
-Hello?
-No, I'm here. Can you hear me?

09:43.917 --> 09:44.918
I lost her.

09:45.878 --> 09:49.256
And she was just about to say yes
to the solar panels and call me a genius.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.677
You know, dude,

09:53.760 --> 09:57.431
remember when that airline didn't believe
you were an emotional support animal?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.434
I'm starting to understand why.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.441
Mokey?

10:07.524 --> 10:09.359
We don't need all this.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.404
We could just head for the Calming Caves
and just--

10:12.487 --> 10:17.201
Lyle, please. I've done my homework.
I know the Craggles love games.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.327
-Yeah.
-We do too.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.913
-So let's foster that connection, okay?
-Actually--

10:20.996 --> 10:22.456
Start her up, Barry!

10:23.207 --> 10:25.167
We're here live in the Great Hall.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.837
I'm Barry Blueberry
providing the color commentary,

10:28.921 --> 10:30.088
and that color is blue.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.299
Boom.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.386
Let the Giggle Gaggle Games begin!

10:37.179 --> 10:39.014
-Is that my cue?
-That's your cue.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.728
Yeah!

10:44.811 --> 10:46.939
Hey, Gobo, did you see that?

10:47.022 --> 10:48.106
I saw it, bud.

10:48.190 --> 10:52.444
The first game up is a Fraggle favorite,
the Pole of Nonsense.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.947
Isn't this great?

10:56.657 --> 11:00.327
A gummy, gummy boo and a gummy, gummy you.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.329
Oh, okay. That's fun.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.081
A gummy, gummy--

11:04.164 --> 11:07.626
Excuse me. You know, Mokey,
we don't have to do this.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.629
Lyle, I feel so connected to you now.

11:10.712 --> 11:11.839
Me too. Yeah.

11:13.382 --> 11:17.052
Radish-ade! Fresh radish-ade!
Get your fresh radish-ade!

11:17.636 --> 11:19.054
What time is it?

11:19.137 --> 11:22.474
Time for the Great Radish Run.
I'm Barry Blueberry.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.437
I love confetti.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.940
Giggle gaggle, giggle gaggle, radish race!

11:33.318 --> 11:34.319
Oh, no. It's okay.

11:34.403 --> 11:38.907
Well, the Fraggles are demonstrating
exemplary radish balancing skills,

11:38.991 --> 11:41.702
but the Craggles
just can't seem to get it.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.079
-This is so fun, right?
-Oh, wow.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.455
Well, it's something.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.252
Lots of bruised radishes
on the dinner table tonight.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.462
I'm Barry Blueberry.

11:53.005 --> 11:54.715
Yeah, confetti.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.216
Huh? Right?

11:56.300 --> 12:01.180
That's my signature. Next up,
one of my favorites, the Slip and Flip.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.182
Hope nobody gets hurt out there.

12:07.019 --> 12:10.480
Well, once again,
the Fraggles make it look easy.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.983
Look at those excellent scores
from the judges.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.484
While the Craggles…

12:16.653 --> 12:17.905
…do not.

12:17.988 --> 12:21.450
What a beautiful, joyful mess!

12:21.533 --> 12:25.996
And now it's time
for the traditional dance break!

12:26.705 --> 12:28.457
Dance break. Dance break.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.007
Excuse me. Coming through.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.301
-Hey, Mokey?
-Yeah?

12:40.135 --> 12:43.764
Don't take this the wrong way,
but this is a huge disaster.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.432
And the Craggles hate it.

12:46.183 --> 12:49.394
Well, maybe we just haven't found
the right game yet.

12:50.062 --> 12:53.315
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a dance break.

12:54.650 --> 12:55.651
Gosh!

12:58.195 --> 13:00.531
I've never heard her say "gosh" before.

13:00.614 --> 13:01.865
She's really upset.

13:05.327 --> 13:08.288
Well, I think she just really cares
about the Craggles.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.499
But hopefully the Wise Council's
coming up with

13:10.582 --> 13:12.125
-a plan to help them.
-Yeah.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.461
I've got it!

13:15.963 --> 13:17.089
What is it, Icy?

13:17.673 --> 13:23.512
What is the difference
between a Doozer and a Gorg?

13:23.595 --> 13:24.596
What?

13:24.680 --> 13:28.225
The number of bites it takes to eat one!

13:31.270 --> 13:32.396
Oh, Icy Joe!

13:32.479 --> 13:35.691
-You're bad! You're bad.
-I know. I know.

13:35.774 --> 13:36.942
Attention, everyone!

13:37.025 --> 13:38.694
Bathroom break number 32.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.946
Take a break. I've got another one!

13:41.029 --> 13:43.657
I don't know. What are we gonna tell her?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.450
I have no idea.

13:45.534 --> 13:46.535
Okay!

13:46.618 --> 13:50.998
I've danced it off, and now we just
need to harvest all that positive energy

13:51.081 --> 13:55.669
and move on to the ultimate
hide-and-sleek game.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.713
Hey, where'd the Craggles go?

13:57.796 --> 14:01.091
-Well, they're hiding.
-Yeah.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.384
Already?

14:02.467 --> 14:05.262
Wow, they knew the next game
before I even said it.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.766
They're not play-hiding,
they're hide-hiding.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.768
What? Why?

14:11.852 --> 14:14.479
Because they wanted to get away from you.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.191
They don't like any of this.
I'm Barry Blueberry.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.614
I-- I-I'm so sorry. My-- My hand slipped.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.450
I know that was totally
not the right moment for that.

14:37.211 --> 14:41.089
It just hurts because
I really thought I understood them,

14:41.965 --> 14:43.217
but I don't.

14:44.718 --> 14:48.347
Mokey. I hate to see you handstand cry.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.058
It's impressive, but it's sad.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.022
Mokey. Your heart was in the right place.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.607
Yeah. You meant well,

14:58.690 --> 15:01.109
but maybe understanding the Craggles

15:01.193 --> 15:04.780
is more complicated
than just reading about them in a book.

15:07.991 --> 15:12.079
You know, even my Uncle Matt has trouble
connecting with other creatures sometimes.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.205
Oh, no way.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.583
Yeah, in fact he actually
just sent me a postcard about it.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.336
I'd like to hear it.

15:20.504 --> 15:23.715
"Dear Nephew Gobo,
I write to you from what seems to be…"

15:23.799 --> 15:26.802
The land of the hairier,
more intelligent creatures.

15:27.761 --> 15:32.266
The hairy ones have Silly Creatures
waiting on them hand and hoof.

15:32.349 --> 15:35.352
I knew I needed to connect
with this superior being.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.938
Hello, great to meet you.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.025
They immediately knew I was important.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.070
-I tried speaking their language.
-Bark! Bark!

15:45.153 --> 15:48.240
But they couldn't understand me
and that's when it hit me.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.784
I knew nothing about them.

15:50.868 --> 15:55.163
And by wisely admitting that,
it opened up an incredible new discovery.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.500
The Orb of Understanding.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.629
A simple wave of this orb seems to say…

16:03.297 --> 16:05.716
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

16:07.009 --> 16:10.721
There's nothing more gratifying
than connecting with a stranger.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.807
So here it is, Gobo,
the Orb of Understanding.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.435
May you use it,
as the Silly Creatures say…

16:16.518 --> 16:17.519
Like a good boy.

16:17.603 --> 16:20.105
That's a good boy! Who's a good boy?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.820
I wanted to make the Craggles
feel welcome so badly

16:27.321 --> 16:29.948
that I forgot about
the most important thing:

16:30.657 --> 16:33.035
asking what they wanted.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.246
Well, maybe you should go tell them that.

16:36.330 --> 16:38.957
Yeah. I gotta find them
and set things right.

16:39.750 --> 16:43.795
But I don't know where they went.
Probably somewhere calm.

16:44.630 --> 16:47.591
Wait, they mentioned Calming Cave.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.511
-Let's go! Yeah!
-Yeah!

16:50.594 --> 16:51.887
Come on. Hurry.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.890
Build more! Build more! Build more!

16:54.973 --> 16:57.142
Cotterpin, do you hear that?

16:57.226 --> 17:02.564
All of Doozerdom can't wait to build
bigger, higher, Doozier structures,

17:02.648 --> 17:05.150
and it's all because of that goo
you discovered.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.403
But, sir, we need more testing.

17:08.487 --> 17:11.281
The Fraggles don't like
eating the goo sticks,

17:11.365 --> 17:14.535
which could present
a huge sustainability issue.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.579
-Goo! Goo!
-Oh, I hate to miss a good chant.

17:17.663 --> 17:22.041
Now, Cotterpin, you get back to fixing
this Doozer tube, and let's talk later.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.544
-Oh, but--
-I'm coming!

17:23.627 --> 17:26.922
-Goo! Goo! Goo! Chanting is fun.
-But, sir, the--

17:27.005 --> 17:28.924
No one is listening to me.

17:29.007 --> 17:33.011
I wish I'd never discovered
that awful goo to begin with!

17:33.095 --> 17:36.223
Why won't anyone listen to me?

17:37.975 --> 17:42.145
How can I power my home lab
if my landlord won't even listen to me?

17:42.229 --> 17:45.315
All I'm trying to do
is make a difference in the world.

17:45.399 --> 17:46.400
Exactly!

17:46.483 --> 17:50.028
Wait, what's up with this Bluetooth today?
Is this a podcast or something?

17:50.112 --> 17:54.575
And it's like every time I try,
someone's there to stop me, like,

17:54.658 --> 17:57.369
"No, thank you, little girl. Try again."

17:57.452 --> 17:59.162
That is how it feels.

17:59.872 --> 18:01.915
-It's relentless!
-It's relentless!

18:01.999 --> 18:04.543
Wait. It's relentless.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.630
So, I need to be relentless too.

18:09.339 --> 18:12.593
I just need to keep on trying
no matter what.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.178
If they won't give up,

18:14.261 --> 18:16.680
-I'm not giving up either.
-I'm not giving up either.

18:19.933 --> 18:23.228
This is incredible. Hello?

18:24.021 --> 18:28.275
If you can hear me, I just wanted to say
you've got this, sister!

18:28.358 --> 18:30.194
You are an inspiration!

18:32.905 --> 18:34.281
You're right, Sprocket.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.743
You and the magic Bluetooth lady
who seems, frankly, rad.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.494
I am not giving up.

18:42.331 --> 18:44.625
-Hello?
-Hi, Mrs. Shimmelfinney.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.669
I just wanted to let you know that
I am a PhD candidate,

18:47.753 --> 18:50.923
and I'm working on a project
that could eventually save the world.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.800
All I need is to install
some solar panels on the roof.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.761
-But before you say no--
-Yeah, sure.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.347
-Wait, you're saying yes?
-Yeah, I'm saying yes.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.431
Okay.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.476
Thank you, Mrs. Shimmelfinney. Love you.

19:03.352 --> 19:04.686
"Love you"?

19:07.105 --> 19:08.315
We got this.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.579
Here we are!

19:25.791 --> 19:27.292
What's happening here?

19:28.001 --> 19:29.753
Quiet, quiet, please, please.

19:29.837 --> 19:34.466
You see, I'm on watch duty,
and all the Craggles are very tired.

19:34.550 --> 19:38.303
Oh, Lyle, I wore you all out.
I'm so sorry.

19:38.387 --> 19:41.265
Here. This is for you.

19:46.562 --> 19:48.939
Well-- Thank you.

19:49.022 --> 19:52.025
It's a-- What-- What is it?

19:52.109 --> 19:54.528
The Orb of Understanding.

19:54.611 --> 19:58.323
Clearly, I know nothing about you,
but I want to.

19:58.407 --> 20:02.077
So if you ever wanna tell me
about yourselves, I wanna listen,

20:02.160 --> 20:05.664
but also, I understand
if you just want space.

20:06.582 --> 20:08.417
Do you wanna know why we sleep?

20:09.001 --> 20:10.210
Because you're tired of me?

20:10.294 --> 20:13.589
Oh, no, Mokey. It's not about you.

20:13.672 --> 20:16.508
You see, Craggles sleep most of the day.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.510
-You do?
-Really?

20:20.679 --> 20:24.266
We need sleep, and that's why
we came here to Calming Cave.

20:24.349 --> 20:28.896
It's the closest place here at
Fraggle Rock to how Craggle Lagoon feels.

20:28.979 --> 20:33.483
The perfect darkness and temperature
for a long snooze.

20:33.567 --> 20:38.197
I read every word of that book,
and it didn't say a thing about that.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.448
What book?

20:42.326 --> 20:44.828
This wasn't even written by a Craggle.

20:44.912 --> 20:49.458
Yeah. You know, it's really hard
to capture who we are in a book.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.711
Craggles live and play
on a different plane

20:52.794 --> 20:55.547
that we access through a dream state.

20:55.631 --> 20:57.049
You do?

20:57.549 --> 21:00.177
-Sorry, sorry, sorry. Self-shush.
-Yeah. Nice.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.970
-That sounds incredible.
-Yeah.

21:02.054 --> 21:03.305
How does it work?

21:03.388 --> 21:06.016
Well, do you wanna see?

21:06.099 --> 21:08.018
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:16.818 --> 21:21.698
Dream a dream and see

21:21.782 --> 21:25.410
What a dream can be

21:32.960 --> 21:36.088
What makes dreamers feel

21:36.171 --> 21:39.007
Dreams are more than real?

21:39.091 --> 21:42.386
Why does dreaming keep revealing

21:42.469 --> 21:45.347
What our lives conceal?

21:45.430 --> 21:48.725
Dream a dream and see

21:48.809 --> 21:51.520
What a dream can be

21:51.603 --> 21:54.898
Dream a dream and see

21:54.982 --> 21:57.317
Why sweet dreamers dream

21:59.152 --> 22:00.529
Yeah!

22:02.739 --> 22:05.826
When I wake I see

22:05.909 --> 22:09.204
One more mystery

22:09.288 --> 22:15.127
While our lives run
Is there someone dreaming you and me?

22:15.210 --> 22:18.463
Dream a dream and see

22:18.547 --> 22:21.592
What a dream can be

22:21.675 --> 22:24.845
Dream a dream and see

22:24.928 --> 22:27.973
Why sweet dreamers dream

22:28.056 --> 22:30.434
Dream a dream and see

22:30.517 --> 22:34.062
See, oh, what a dream can be

22:34.146 --> 22:37.232
Dream a dream and see

22:37.316 --> 22:40.360
Why sweet dreamers dream

22:40.944 --> 22:45.574
Dream a dream and see

22:45.657 --> 22:51.371
What a dream can be

22:55.209 --> 22:58.003
That was awesome.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.129
Incredible.

22:59.213 --> 23:01.131
Dream Games!

23:03.050 --> 23:05.969
Thank you for showing me your world, Lyle.

23:06.053 --> 23:08.680
You're right. It's indescribable.

23:08.764 --> 23:11.225
Which, by the way,
doesn't even describe it.

23:12.476 --> 23:13.977
Okay, now please tell me,

23:14.061 --> 23:16.897
is there anything we can do
to make you all more comfortable?

23:16.980 --> 23:21.777
Well, can we stay here at Calming Cave
until we can go back to Craggle Lagoon?

23:21.860 --> 23:22.945
Well, of course.

23:23.028 --> 23:25.989
Yeah, and don't worry.
We're doing everything in our power

23:26.073 --> 23:29.660
to get the water back to Craggle Lagoon
as soon as fraggly possible.

23:30.244 --> 23:33.455
Until then, our water is your water.

23:33.539 --> 23:35.582
We have plenty to share.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.084
Yeah.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.586
Pa! Pa!

23:41.588 --> 23:44.174
I'm almost done
with the fountain you asked for.

23:44.258 --> 23:48.387
But are you really, really sure
you wanna take all the water like this?

23:48.470 --> 23:50.806
Sure? Why, of course I'm sure!

23:50.889 --> 23:53.809
In fact,
it's-- it's exhausting being this sure.

23:53.892 --> 23:57.062
-Now, you finish it, Junior!
-Okay, Pa.

23:57.145 --> 23:59.648
This water is ours to control!

24:05.863 --> 24:07.197
That should do it.

24:10.117 --> 24:13.287
Ma, get the sparkling radish juice!

24:13.370 --> 24:16.373
And I mean the good
sparkling radish juice.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.834
Ooh la la!

24:20.752 --> 24:22.754
What's happening to the water?

24:25.132 --> 24:26.216
Oh, no!

24:26.967 --> 24:29.553
Where did all the water go?

24:31.763 --> 24:32.764
What does this mean?

24:32.848 --> 24:35.475
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
This can't be good.

24:36.101 --> 24:38.312
You're looking
at a real cliff-hanger, folks!

24:38.395 --> 24:40.147
I'm Barry Blueberry!
