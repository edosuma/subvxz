Hello? Hello?

03:59.188 --> 04:00.689
Hello? <i>Merde!</i>

04:06.913 --> 04:08.414
Here you go.

04:34.057 --> 04:35.441
Hello.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.025
What do you recommend
for a catatonic fit

04:37.026 --> 04:38.727
in a parking garage?

04:38.728 --> 04:41.313
Ask your doctor.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.315
Did you just call a minute ago?

04:44.317 --> 04:46.452
Mm. It must have be Harold.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.403
My doctor just canceled.
Can I come over?

04:48.404 --> 04:50.489
You're about
a day and a half early.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.992
I just got in. I don't think
I'm ready for you yet.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.877
Why did the prick cancel?

04:54.877 --> 04:55.961
Oh, a virus or something.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.580
He said he was
just too sick.

04:57.580 --> 04:59.465
Why didn't you tell him
you're sicker than he is?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.250
Huh. He already knows that.

05:01.250 --> 05:04.136
Okay, come on over.
And bring some ice.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.722
Oh, Michael, don't give me
any responsibility.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.725
At the moment, I can't
cope with anything weightier

05:08.725 --> 05:10.560
than the directions
to your apartment.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.645
Look, if you want a cold martini
when you get over here,

05:12.645 --> 05:14.263
you better cope
with some ice.

05:14.263 --> 05:15.731
I'll cope with some ice.

05:16.599 --> 05:18.434
I thought you said
I was too early.

05:18.434 --> 05:20.519
You heard what I said.
You're too early, and hurry up.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.521
Goodbye-aye-aye.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.661
Seventy-five.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.665
Keep it.

05:52.635 --> 05:53.636
How'd you get in?

05:53.636 --> 05:56.305
The street door was open.
Want a drink?

05:56.305 --> 05:58.890
Nope. Not until
I've had my shower.

05:58.891 --> 06:00.392
I want something
to work out today.

06:00.393 --> 06:03.362
I wanna try to relax
and enjoy something.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.155
I see you managed
to cope with Doubleday.

06:13.156 --> 06:14.740
Or did you meet
a bookmobile on the way?

06:14.741 --> 06:16.709
Ha, ha, ha.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.793
Excuse me.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.465
Are you in a blue funk
because of the doctor?

06:22.465 --> 06:23.916
Christ, no.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.500
I was depressed
long before I got there.

06:25.501 --> 06:27.002
Well, this'll
pick you up.

06:27.003 --> 06:30.089
I went shopping today and
bought all kinds of goodies:

06:30.089 --> 06:31.590
sandalwood soap...

06:31.591 --> 06:33.309
Oh, I feel better already.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.893
Your very own toothbrush,

06:34.894 --> 06:36.896
because I'm sick to death
of you using mine.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.898
Well, how do you think
I feel?

06:38.898 --> 06:40.399
You've had worse things
in your mouth.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.903
And also for you,
something called Control.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.404
Now, notice.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.407
Nowhere on the label
is it called hair spray.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.908
Just simply Control.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.410
And the words "for men"
are written about 37 times

06:51.411 --> 06:52.912
all over the goddamn can.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.364
Hm. And it's called
butch assurance.

06:55.364 --> 06:56.448
Still hair spray,

06:56.449 --> 06:58.250
no matter if
they call it "Balls."

06:59.535 --> 07:02.120
It's all on your very own shelf,
which is to be labeled

07:02.121 --> 07:03.922
"Donald's Saturday Night
Douche Kit."

07:06.592 --> 07:08.677
By the way, are you
spending the night?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.429
Nope. I'm driving back.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.632
Why didn't the prick
call you and cancel?

07:13.633 --> 07:15.551
Suppose you'd driven
all this way for nothing?

07:15.551 --> 07:17.769
Why do you keep
calling him a prick?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.355
Whoever heard of an analyst
having a session with a patient

07:20.356 --> 07:22.808
for two hours
on Saturday evening.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.727
He simply prefers
to take Mondays off.

07:24.727 --> 07:27.813
Works late Saturdays
and takes Mondays off?

07:27.814 --> 07:30.449
What is he, a psychiatrist
or a hairdresser?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.534
Well, actually, he's both.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.370
He shrinks my head
and then combs me out.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.622
Besides, I had to
come in town

07:36.622 --> 07:37.623
to a birthday
party anyway.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.625
Right?
You had to remind me.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.628
If there's one thing
I'm not ready for,

07:42.628 --> 07:46.131
it's five screaming queens
singing "Happy Birthday."

07:46.132 --> 07:47.633
Who's coming?

07:47.633 --> 07:49.468
Well, they're really
all Harold's friends.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.304
It's his birthday,
and I want everything to be

07:51.304 --> 07:52.805
just the way he'd want it.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.807
I don't wanna have to
listen to him kvetch about how

07:54.807 --> 07:56.308
"Nobody ever does anything

07:56.309 --> 07:57.893
for anybody but themselves."

07:57.894 --> 07:59.478
"Himself."

07:59.479 --> 08:00.480
Himself.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.482
I think you know
everybody anyway.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.151
It's the same old
tired fairies

08:06.152 --> 08:07.653
you've seen around
since the day one.

08:09.155 --> 08:13.025
Actually, there'll be seven,
counting Harold and you. And me.

08:13.025 --> 08:16.495
Are you calling me a screaming
queen or a tired fairy?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.581
I beg your pardon.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.583
There'll be six tired,
screaming fairy queens

08:20.583 --> 08:22.001
and one anxious queer.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.372
Listen, I'll be out of
your way in one second.

08:26.372 --> 08:29.208
I've just got
one more thing to do here.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.460
Surgery, so early
in the evening?

08:31.460 --> 08:32.544
"Cunt."

08:33.546 --> 08:35.014
That's French, with a cedilla.

08:35.965 --> 08:37.967
I just have to
comb my hair again.

08:37.967 --> 08:39.434
For the 37th time.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.389
Hair. That's singular.

08:43.389 --> 08:44.890
My hair,
without exaggeration,

08:44.891 --> 08:46.809
is clearly falling
on the floor, baby.

08:46.809 --> 08:48.477
And fast.

08:48.477 --> 08:50.562
You're totally paranoid.
You've got plenty of hair.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.281
No. What you see
before you

08:52.281 --> 08:54.783
is a masterpiece
of deception.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.819
My hairline
starts about here.

08:56.819 --> 08:58.904
All this is just
tortured forward.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.407
Well, I hope for your sake,
no strong wind comes up.

09:02.825 --> 09:05.327
Well, if one does,
I'll be in terrible trouble.

09:05.328 --> 09:09.248
I will then have a bald head
and shoulder-length fringe.

09:09.248 --> 09:10.832
Look.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.334
Not good, huh?

09:12.335 --> 09:14.303
Hm. Not the greatest.
Tsk.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.671
It's called getting old.

09:18.007 --> 09:20.509
Well, there's one thing
to be said for masturbation:

09:20.509 --> 09:22.477
you certainly don't have to
look your best.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.012
Oh. Will you get
out of here?

09:28.684 --> 09:30.769
What are you
so depressed about?

09:30.770 --> 09:32.822
Other than the usual
everything, I mean.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.274
I really don't wanna
get into it.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.608
Well, if you're
not gonna tell me,

09:36.609 --> 09:38.827
how can we have
a conversation in-depth?

09:38.828 --> 09:41.163
A warm, rewarding,
meaningful friendship?

09:41.163 --> 09:42.998
Up yours!

09:42.999 --> 09:45.501
Why, Captain Butler, how you talk.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.419
It's just that, today,
I finally realized

09:47.420 --> 09:49.922
that I was raised
to be a failure.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.174
I was groomed for it.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.759
Naturally, it all goes
back to Evelyn and Walt.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.762
Christ. How sick analysts
must get of hearing

09:56.762 --> 09:59.631
how Mama and Daddy made
their darling into a fairy.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.684
It's beyond just that now.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.719
Today, I finally began to see

10:03.719 --> 10:06.722
how some of the other pieces
of the puzzle relate to them.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.192
Like why I never
finished anything

10:10.192 --> 10:12.777
I've started in my life.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.864
My neurotic compulsion
to not succeed.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.067
Donald, you're
so serious this evening.

10:20.569 --> 10:23.071
♪ Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy ♪

10:23.072 --> 10:25.407
♪ You better chase
All your cares away ♪

10:28.210 --> 10:29.711
What's more boring than a queen

10:29.712 --> 10:31.547
doing a Judy Garland imitation?

10:31.547 --> 10:34.499
A queen doing
a Bette Davis imitation.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.805
Meanwhile, back at
the Evelyn and Walt syndrome.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.923
Failure is the only thing
with which I feel at home,

10:41.924 --> 10:45.143
because...that's what
I was taught at home.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.026
Where did you get
that sweater?

11:00.026 --> 11:03.112
This clever little shop
on the Right Bank called Hermès.

11:03.112 --> 11:06.281
I work my ass off
for 45 lousy dollars a week,

11:06.282 --> 11:07.866
scrubbing floors,
and you waltz around

11:07.867 --> 11:09.251
throwing cashmere sweaters on.

11:10.119 --> 11:12.204
The one on the floor
in the john is vicuña.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.672
Why, I beg your pardon.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.625
You can get a job doing
something else, you know.

11:16.625 --> 11:20.045
Nobody's holding a gun
to your head to be a charwoman.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.048
And that is, how you say,
your neurosis.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.383
Gee, and I thought
it's why I was born.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.468
Besides, just because
I wear expensive clothes

11:26.469 --> 11:28.220
does not necessarily mean
they're paid for.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.605
Oh, that is, how you say,
your neurosis.

11:30.606 --> 11:34.192
I'm a spoiled brat. So, what
do I know about maturity?

11:36.145 --> 11:38.197
The only thing "mature" means
to me is Victor Mature.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.150
I can understand people having
an affinity for the stage,

11:42.151 --> 11:45.287
but movies are such garbage,
who can take them seriously?

11:45.287 --> 11:48.323
Well, I'm sorry if
your sense of art is offended.

11:48.324 --> 11:49.875
Odd as it may seem,

11:49.875 --> 11:53.078
there was no Shubert Theatre
in Hot Coffee, Mississippi.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.664
However, thanks to
the silver screen,

11:55.664 --> 11:58.667
your neurosis has got...style.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.168
It takes a certain flair

12:00.169 --> 12:03.672
to squander one's unemployment
check at Pavilion.

12:03.672 --> 12:06.257
What's so snappy about being
head over heels in debt?

12:07.760 --> 12:09.762
The only thing smart about it
is the ingenious ways

12:09.762 --> 12:11.764
I dodge the bill collectors.

12:13.015 --> 12:14.516
Come to think of it,
you're the type

12:14.517 --> 12:16.602
that gives faggots
a bad name.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.687
And you, Donald...

12:18.687 --> 12:21.189
you are a credit
to the homosexual.

12:21.190 --> 12:22.691
A reliable, hardworking,

12:22.691 --> 12:24.192
floor-scrubbing,

12:24.193 --> 12:27.246
bill-paying fag, who don't
owe nothin' to nobody.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.031
I am a model fairy.

12:30.282 --> 12:31.783
You think it's just nifty...

12:31.784 --> 12:34.286
how I've always flitted
from Beverly Hills

12:34.286 --> 12:37.839
to Rome to Acapulco
to Amsterdam...

12:37.840 --> 12:40.542
picking up a lot of
one night stands.

12:40.543 --> 12:43.629
And a lot of custom-made duds
along the trail.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.633
Well, I'm here to tell you

12:47.633 --> 12:49.635
that the only place
in all those miles--

12:49.635 --> 12:52.554
The only place I've ever been
happy was on the goddamn plane.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.693
Run, charge,
run.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.277
Borrow, make.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.783
Spend...run.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.071
Waste, waste, waste.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.126
And why?

13:18.664 --> 13:20.465
And why?

13:25.921 --> 13:27.889
<i>Fini.</i> Applause.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.400
There's nothing
quite as good

13:38.400 --> 13:40.402
as feeling sorry
for yourself, is there?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.408
Nothing.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.912
I adore cheap sentiment.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.135
Backstage, New Moon.

14:14.637 --> 14:17.139
Alan. My God!
I don't believe it.

14:17.139 --> 14:18.440
How are you?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.525
Uh, listen, Michael,
w-what are you doing tonight?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.110
Oh, I'm all tied up tonight.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.445
Uh, no, tonight's
no good for me.

14:24.813 --> 14:25.814
Oh, I'm all tied up too,

14:25.814 --> 14:27.315
but I...

14:27.316 --> 14:29.117
I thought I might just
drop by for a drink?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.453
Oh, you mean now?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.456
Oh, um...

14:34.456 --> 14:37.959
well, Alan,
old buddy, um...

14:37.960 --> 14:39.461
well, you see,
it's a friend's birthday,

14:39.461 --> 14:41.463
and I'm having some people in.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.466
I'm sorry I can't ask you
to join us,

14:44.466 --> 14:46.251
but I'm afraid it just
wouldn't work out, kiddo.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.670
Is it place cards?

14:48.671 --> 14:50.756
No, it's not. It's just--

14:50.756 --> 14:53.225
Oh, well, I'd hate to see you
for just for ten minutes.

14:54.677 --> 14:56.679
Oh, Mickey, please.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.316
Alan? What's wrong?

15:04.153 --> 15:07.105
Mickey, I've gotta see you
about something right away.

15:07.106 --> 15:10.192
W-well, um-- Now, look, um--
Come on over.

15:11.694 --> 15:13.195
Oh, no. That's
perfectly okay.

15:13.195 --> 15:15.947
Um...just come on over,
and we'll have a quick drink.

15:15.948 --> 15:18.033
It's the same old address?

15:20.035 --> 15:21.036
Okay.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.599
Well, am I stunning?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.184
You're absolutely
stunning.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.136
You look like shit,
but I'm absolutely stunned.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.473
Your grapes are,
how you say, sour?

15:41.473 --> 15:43.391
Listen, you won't believe
what just happened.

15:43.392 --> 15:44.893
Hey, where's my drink?
Oh, I didn't make it.

15:44.893 --> 15:46.394
I've been
on the phone.

15:46.395 --> 15:48.897
It was my old roommate
from Georgetown just called.

15:48.897 --> 15:50.398
Oh, Alan, um,
what's-his-name?

15:50.399 --> 15:52.901
McCarthy. He's up here
from Washington.

15:52.901 --> 15:53.902
On business or something.

15:53.902 --> 15:55.403
And he's on
his way over here.

15:55.404 --> 15:57.906
Well, I hope he knows
the lyrics to "Happy Birthday."

15:57.906 --> 15:59.908
Listen, asshole,
what am I gonna do?

15:59.908 --> 16:00.909
He's straight.

16:00.909 --> 16:02.744
Square City.

16:02.745 --> 16:04.580
I mean, he's really terribly proper.

16:04.580 --> 16:06.081
Awfully good family.

16:06.081 --> 16:08.083
Oh, that's <i>so</i> important.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.802
I mean, his family looks down on people in the theater.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.887
So, what do you think
he'll feel about

16:11.887 --> 16:13.889
this freak show I've got
booked in for dinner?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.891
Oh, Christ,
is that good.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.392
He really lost his spring
on the telephone.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.396
He started crying. And
that's not his style at all.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.898
He's so goddamn pulled together,
he wouldn't show any emotion

16:22.898 --> 16:24.182
if he was in a plane crash.

16:25.434 --> 16:26.935
What am I gonna do?

16:26.935 --> 16:29.354
Are you suddenly ashamed
of your friends?

16:29.355 --> 16:32.241
Donald, you are the only person
I know whom I'm truly ashamed.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.826
Now, look, some people have
different standards,

16:34.827 --> 16:35.911
and we have to
acknowledge them.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.913
You know what you are,
Michael?

16:37.913 --> 16:39.831
You're a real person.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.200
Thank you, and fuck you.

16:43.452 --> 16:45.504
Want some cracked crab?
No thanks.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.006
How could you ever
have been friends

16:48.007 --> 16:49.675
with a bore
like that?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.259
Well, believe it or not,
there was a time in my life

16:51.260 --> 16:53.879
when I didn't go around
announcing that I was a faggot.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.882
Well, that must have been before
speech replaced sign language.

16:56.882 --> 16:58.967
Now, don't give me
any static on that score.

16:58.967 --> 17:01.352
I did not come out until after
I graduated from college.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.938
It seems to me,
the first time we tricked,

17:03.939 --> 17:06.441
we met in a gay bar
on Third Avenue,

17:06.442 --> 17:08.644
during your, uh,
<i>junior</i> year.

17:08.644 --> 17:09.778
Cunt.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.729
Oh, I thought
you'd never say it.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.364
Are you sure you don't want
some cracked crab?

17:13.365 --> 17:16.317
Not yet. If you don't mind.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.955
Might know you'd be
working the streets.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.127
You want my body, you're
gonna have to pay for it.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.545
The last time
I saw a leg like that,

17:26.545 --> 17:28.128
it had a message
attached to it.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.414
Get in.

17:30.666 --> 17:34.169
Hi, big boy.
You like Chinese laundress?

17:34.169 --> 17:35.170
Heh, heh.
Hello, Emory.

17:35.170 --> 17:36.671
No tickee,
no nooky.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.228
Well, that's all we need,
for it to rain.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.232
You want some more
club soda?

17:48.233 --> 17:49.734
What?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.019
There's nothing but
club soda in that glass.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.823
I've been watching you
for several Saturdays now.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.492
You've actually stopped
drinking, haven't you?

17:57.493 --> 17:58.944
And smoking too.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.029
How long's it been?

18:01.029 --> 18:02.113
Five weeks.

18:02.114 --> 18:05.117
That's amazing.
I've found God.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.618
Or is God dead?

18:06.618 --> 18:08.620
Yes. Thank God.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.205
I could always tell when
you were getting high.

18:11.206 --> 18:12.707
One way.

18:12.708 --> 18:14.209
I'd get hostile.

18:14.209 --> 18:16.344
What made you stop?
The analyst?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.930
Well...certainly had
a lot to do with it.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.717
But mainly, I just didn't
think I could survive

18:22.718 --> 18:24.686
another hangover,
that's all.

18:24.686 --> 18:26.220
Didn't think I could
get through one more

18:26.221 --> 18:27.972
morning-after
ick attack.

18:27.973 --> 18:30.525
"Morning-after" what?
Icks.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.561
Anxiety. Guilt.

18:32.561 --> 18:34.062
Hm.

18:34.062 --> 18:35.563
From that split second
when your eyes pop open,

18:35.564 --> 18:37.065
and you say,

18:37.065 --> 18:39.567
"My God, what did I do
last night?"

18:39.568 --> 18:41.570
And then suddenly,
zap.

18:41.570 --> 18:43.071
Total recall.

18:43.071 --> 18:44.072
Tell me
about it.

18:44.072 --> 18:46.574
And then that struggle
to survive until lunchtime,

18:46.575 --> 18:48.710
when you have
a double bloody mary.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.411
That is, if you've
waited till lunch.

18:51.747 --> 18:53.248
And then you're half pissed
and useless

18:53.248 --> 18:54.716
for the rest of
the afternoon.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.751
So you hang on
till cocktail time.

18:56.752 --> 18:59.254
And by then, you're ready
for what the evening holds,

18:59.254 --> 19:01.256
which hopefully
is another party,

19:01.256 --> 19:04.259
where the whole goddamn cycle
starts all over again.

19:05.761 --> 19:08.930
Yeah, well, I've been on that
merry-go-round long enough.

19:08.931 --> 19:12.985
And I either had to get off
or die of centrifugal force.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.073
Joe College has
finally arrived.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.657
And suddenly,
I've gotten such icks.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.243
Oh, um-- Now, Donald,
when he gets up here--

19:22.244 --> 19:24.829
Michael, don't insult me
by giving me any lecture

19:24.830 --> 19:26.948
on acceptable social behavior.

19:26.949 --> 19:29.001
I promise to sit with
my legs spread apart

19:29.001 --> 19:30.585
and keep my voice
in a deep register.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.622
Donald, you are
a real card-carrying cunt.

19:43.465 --> 19:46.134
All right, this is a raid.
Everyone's under arrest.

19:46.134 --> 19:50.221
Hi, darling. Connie Casserole.
Oh, Mary, don't ask.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.107
Hello, Emory. Put
that in the kitchen. Okay.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.609
Hello, Larry. How are you?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.194
Are we the first?
No, you're not.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.198
Who is this exotic
woman over here?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.699
Hi, Emory.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.200
My dear, I thought
you'd perished.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.202
Where have you
been hiding

20:03.202 --> 20:04.870
your classically chiseled
features?

20:04.870 --> 20:05.954
I don't live
in the city anymore.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.705
Emory, where's your gift?

20:07.706 --> 20:09.791
Oh. It's arriving later.

20:12.628 --> 20:13.629
Larry. Larry.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.080
What?
Give Michael the gift.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.631
Oh, here.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.633
Uh, louder,
so my mother

20:17.633 --> 20:19.134
in Philadelphia
can hear you.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.636
Well, you were just standing
there in a trance, weren't you?

20:21.637 --> 20:22.671
Um, I think
you both know Donald.

20:22.671 --> 20:24.255
Nice to see you.
It's nice to meet you.

20:24.256 --> 20:25.257
Hi.
Hi.

20:25.257 --> 20:26.341
I thought
you'd met.

20:26.341 --> 20:28.426
Well, we haven't
exactly met, but we've--

20:28.427 --> 20:28.977
Hi.
Hi.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.511
But you've what?

20:30.512 --> 20:31.596
Oh, we've seen
each other before.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.599
Well, that sounds murky.
Where?

20:33.599 --> 20:36.101
I think they're having
their first fight.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.103
Yeah. The first one
since the last one. Oh.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.271
Where did you find
this trash?

20:40.272 --> 20:42.741
Second Avenue. Leaning
against a lamppost.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.325
With an orchid
behind my ear,

20:44.326 --> 20:46.328
and big red lips
painted over the lip line.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.829
Just like Maria Montez.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.831
Oh, please.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.834
What have you got against Maria?
She was a good woman.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.418
Now, look,
uh, everybody.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.839
Uh, this old college friend
of mine is in town,

20:57.839 --> 20:58.923
and he's on his way
over here,

20:58.924 --> 21:01.927
for a quick drink on his way
to dinner or someplace.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.678
But, now, look,
he's straight.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.764
Straight?
If he's the one I met,

21:05.764 --> 21:07.849
he's about as straight as
the Yellow Brick Road.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.433
No. You met
Justin Stuart.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.886
I don't remember meeting
anybody named Justin Stuart.

21:11.887 --> 21:13.638
Well, of course you don't,
dope. I met him.

21:13.639 --> 21:14.723
Uh, well, this is
somebody else.

21:14.723 --> 21:18.226
Yeah. Alan McCarthy.
A very close total stranger.

21:18.226 --> 21:19.227
Now, it's not that
I care what

21:19.227 --> 21:21.229
he would think
of me. Really.

21:21.229 --> 21:23.731
It's just that he's not ready
for it, and he never will be.

21:23.732 --> 21:25.450
You understand that,
don't you, Hank?

21:25.450 --> 21:26.951
Yeah, sure.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.487
Now, you honestly believe
he doesn't know about you?

21:29.488 --> 21:31.072
Well, if there's
the slightest suspicion,

21:31.073 --> 21:32.157
he's never
let on one bit.

21:32.157 --> 21:33.158
What's he had? A lobotomy?

21:34.576 --> 21:36.661
Well, I was super-careful
when I was in college.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.163
And I still am.

21:38.163 --> 21:41.666
Whenever I see him.
I don't know why, but I am.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.301
Tilt.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.387
When I was in college, I was just like Alan:

21:45.387 --> 21:47.472
very large in
the dating department.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.558
I wore nothing but those
constipated Ivy League clothes,

21:50.559 --> 21:52.561
and those ten-pound
cordovan shoe--

21:54.062 --> 21:55.063
No offense.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.181
Quite all right.
Quite all right.

21:57.182 --> 21:59.434
Who do you have to fuck
to get a drink around here?

21:59.434 --> 22:00.852
Ah. Will you light
somewhere?

22:02.437 --> 22:04.021
I know damn well
I did not come out

22:04.022 --> 22:05.490
until after I graduated.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.525
What about all those weekends
up from school?

22:07.526 --> 22:09.110
Well, I still
wasn't out.

22:09.111 --> 22:12.614
I was still in the "Christ-was-
I-drunk-last-night" syndrome.

22:12.614 --> 22:15.116
Mm. "Man, was I drunk
last night."

22:15.117 --> 22:17.202
"Christ, I don't
remember a thing."

22:17.202 --> 22:18.286
You were just guilty
because

22:18.286 --> 22:20.087
you were Catholic,
that's all.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.122
Now, that's not true.

22:21.123 --> 22:23.125
The "Christ-was-I-drunk-
last-night" syndrome

22:23.125 --> 22:25.677
knows no religion.
It has to do with immaturity.

22:25.677 --> 22:26.678
Although I will admit,

22:26.678 --> 22:28.680
there's a high percentage
of it among Mormons.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.547
Trollop.

22:30.966 --> 22:33.969
Ah, somehow we all managed
to justify our actions

22:33.969 --> 22:34.970
in those days.

22:34.970 --> 22:37.472
Why, later, I found out
that Justin Stuart,

22:37.472 --> 22:39.974
my closet friend--
Oh, other than Alan McCarthy.

22:39.975 --> 22:41.943
--was doing the same thing.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.312
Only he was going up
to Boston for weekends.

22:44.312 --> 22:46.647
You see, in the "Christ-was-I-
drunk-last-night" syndrome,

22:46.648 --> 22:48.149
you really are drunk.
That much of it's true.

22:48.150 --> 22:50.152
It's just that you do
remember everything.

22:50.152 --> 22:53.655
A lot of guys have to get loaded
before they can have sex.

22:53.655 --> 22:55.373
Oh, uh, so I've been told.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.160
Uh, Donald, if you recall, the first time we made it,

22:58.160 --> 23:00.378
I was so drunk,
I could hardly stand up.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.963
You were so drunk,
you could hardly get it up.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.967
Christ, I was so drunk,
I don't remember a thing.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.468
Oh, bullshit. You remember.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.388
♪ Just friends
Lovers no more ♪

23:10.389 --> 23:12.758
You might as well be.
Everyone thinks you are anyway.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.843
Yeah, well,
we never were, really.

23:14.843 --> 23:16.344
No, we didn't
have time to be.

23:16.344 --> 23:17.845
We got to know
each other too fast.

23:19.347 --> 23:21.015
Oh, Jesus, that must be Alan.

23:21.016 --> 23:23.518
Oh, um, now, look, everybody.
Please do me a favor

23:23.518 --> 23:25.653
and cool it for
the few minutes he's here. Okay?

23:25.654 --> 23:27.939
Anything for a sis, Mary.

23:27.939 --> 23:30.024
Now, that's exactly what
I'm talking about, Emory.

23:30.025 --> 23:31.076
No camping.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.660
Sorry.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.663
Think the Giants are gonna win
the pennant this year?

23:34.663 --> 23:35.664
Yeah, fuckin' A,
mac.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.418
Hey, Bernard.
Hey, baby. What's shaking?

23:40.419 --> 23:41.586
My knees.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.338
Oh, it's only another queen.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.423
And it ain't
the red one, either.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.925
It's the queen
of spades.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.929
Hi, Bernadette.
Anyone ever tell you

23:50.929 --> 23:52.430
you'd look divine
in a hammock

23:52.431 --> 23:53.432
surrounded by
louvers

23:53.432 --> 23:54.933
and ceiling fans
and lots and lots

23:54.933 --> 23:56.935
of lush
tropical ferns?

23:56.935 --> 23:57.936
You're such a fag.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.687
You take the cake.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.773
Oh, what about the cake?
Whose job was that?

24:01.773 --> 24:03.775
Mine. I ordered one
to be delivered. What?

24:03.775 --> 24:05.276
How many candles did you say
to put on it? Eighty?

24:05.277 --> 24:07.779
I can't hear, there's noise.
I'm going to the other phone.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.447
Michael? May I use the private line?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.817
Go ahead.

24:17.906 --> 24:20.959
Could I have the number for the Marseilles Bakery in Manhattan?

24:20.959 --> 24:22.543
Everybody ready for a drink?
I guess so.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.797
Ready? I'll be your
topless cocktail waitress.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.331
Please. Spare us the sight
of your sagging tits.

24:28.333 --> 24:29.717
What are you having, kids?

24:29.718 --> 24:31.302
Do you have any beer?
No, in the fridge.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.305
I'll get it.
Who has beer before dinner?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.307
Beer drinkers.
That's telling him.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.809
Well, maybe truck drivers do,
or wall paperers,

24:37.809 --> 24:39.811
but not schoolteachers.
They have sherry.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.813
Yeah? Well, this one
has beer.

24:41.813 --> 24:44.515
Maybe schoolteachers
in public schools.

24:46.351 --> 24:48.353
How can a sensitive
artist like you

24:48.353 --> 24:50.355
live with such an insensitive
bull like that?

24:50.355 --> 24:51.856
I can't.
Emory, you'd live with Hank

24:51.857 --> 24:54.359
in a minute if he'd ask you.
In 58 seconds.

24:54.359 --> 24:55.860
Lord knows
you're <i>sensitive.</i>

24:55.861 --> 24:58.864
Why don't you have a piece
of watermelon and hush up?

24:58.864 --> 25:00.665
Oh, shit, they don't answer.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.749
Well, what are
you having, Emory?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.168
A pink lady.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.253
I'll make my own,
thank you.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.342
Well, let's just hope.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.843
Order, please.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.345
Um...vodka and tonic.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.431
Vod and ton, coming up.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.941
What the hell
is that? Windex?

25:26.942 --> 25:30.312
It's a blue whale.
Oh, Mary, don't ask.

25:30.312 --> 25:33.365
Don't be silly, Alan. There's
nothing to apologize for.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.451
Well, it's just that
I feel like such a fool. I--

25:36.451 --> 25:39.070
I could shoot myself,
letting myself act that way.

25:39.070 --> 25:40.654
Look, it's just as well
that you're not coming.

25:40.655 --> 25:43.124
There are people here, and, uh,
it wouldn't be good to talk.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.575
Look, what about
lunch tomorrow?

25:44.576 --> 25:47.662
Fine. Why don't you, uh--

25:48.663 --> 25:50.164
Why don't you meet me
at the--

25:50.165 --> 25:51.666
The Oak Room, about 1:00?

25:54.169 --> 25:56.671
And listen, Michael...

25:56.671 --> 25:58.673
can you just
forget about tonight?

25:58.673 --> 26:01.142
Pretend it never happened?
I know I have, okay?

26:19.194 --> 26:20.195
<i>♪ Listen, huh ♪</i>

26:23.198 --> 26:25.700

eyes sparkle like Cartiers.

26:34.542 --> 26:35.543
Here.
Oh.

26:35.543 --> 26:37.545
Don't get those

26:37.545 --> 26:39.046
He's not coming.

26:39.047 --> 26:40.548
He'll never know
what he missed.

26:40.548 --> 26:41.549
You know, one of
these days,

26:41.549 --> 26:43.050
you're gonna get
my ass fired.

26:43.051 --> 26:45.553
Hey, thanks, Bernard.
I just read a review of this

26:45.553 --> 26:46.554
in last Sunday's <i>Times.</i>

26:46.554 --> 26:48.556
Just be careful of
the finger smudges.

26:48.556 --> 26:51.058
And no cigarette ashes
on the pages. Sorry.

26:51.059 --> 26:53.061
I didn't know Doubleday's
had a lending library.

26:53.061 --> 26:54.562
Well, they
don't. Hm. Oh.

26:54.562 --> 26:56.063
Well, anyway, looks
like you're stocked up

26:56.064 --> 26:57.565
for the summer, here.

26:57.565 --> 26:59.567
Are you kidding? Last week,
he did the complete works

26:59.567 --> 27:02.570
of Doris Lessing.
That'll last him two days.

27:02.570 --> 27:03.571
It would
last me two years.

27:03.571 --> 27:05.573
I still haven't finished
<i>Atlas Shrugged,</i>

27:05.573 --> 27:07.074
which I started in 1912.

27:07.075 --> 27:09.077
Some people eat, some drink,
and some take drugs.

27:09.077 --> 27:10.078
Yeah, well,
I read.

27:10.078 --> 27:12.080
And read
and read and read.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.582
It's a wonder your eyes
don't turn back in your head

27:14.582 --> 27:15.583
at the sight of
a dust jacket.

27:15.583 --> 27:18.586
Well, at least he's
a constructive escapist.

27:18.586 --> 27:21.805
Yeah. What do I do?
Take planes.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.891
No. I don't
do that anymore.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.894
I don't have the money
to do that anymore.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.929
I go to the baths.
That's about it.

27:27.929 --> 27:30.514
I'm about to do both.
I'm flying to the West Coast.

27:30.515 --> 27:32.984
You still have that act
with a donkey in Tijuana?

27:32.984 --> 27:35.569
I'm going to San Francisco
on a well-earned vacation.

27:35.570 --> 27:38.072
I'm going to the club baths,
and I'm not coming out

27:38.073 --> 27:41.576
till they announce the departure
of TWA one week later.

27:41.576 --> 27:44.078
You'll never learn to stay
out of the baths, will you?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.081
The last time "Emily"
was taking the vapors,

27:46.081 --> 27:47.582
this big hairy number
strolls in.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.083
So Emily says,
"I'm just resting."

27:49.084 --> 27:51.086
And the big, hairy number
says, "I'm just arresting."

27:51.086 --> 27:53.088
It was the Vice.
You have to tell everything,

27:53.088 --> 27:55.623
don't you?
Emory, here.

27:55.623 --> 27:57.758
Thanks, sonny.
You live with your parents?

27:57.759 --> 27:59.627
Yeah, but it's
all right. They're gay.

28:06.634 --> 28:09.136
What happened to Alan?
Oh, he got terrible icks

28:09.137 --> 28:11.139
about having broken down
on the telephone.

28:11.139 --> 28:13.141
He kept apologizing
over and over and over.

28:14.642 --> 28:17.144
He did a big about-face
and turned into the old Alan

28:17.145 --> 28:18.646
right in front of
my very eyes.

28:18.646 --> 28:20.280
Ears.
Ears.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.782
'Scuse me.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.236
Well, obviously the cracked
crab did not work out.

28:25.236 --> 28:27.238
Just put that down, if you
don't want your hand slapped.

28:27.238 --> 28:28.239
I'm about to
have some.

28:28.239 --> 28:30.241
I just wanna pour off
the melted ice.

28:31.242 --> 28:32.743
You know, sometimes
you remind me

28:32.744 --> 28:34.245
of the Chinese
water torture.

28:34.245 --> 28:35.746
No, no, no.
I take that back.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.749
Sometimes you remind me
of the relentless

28:37.749 --> 28:39.083
Chinese water
torture.

28:39.084 --> 28:40.502
Bitch.

28:42.587 --> 28:43.588
Hey, I wonder where
Harold is.

28:43.588 --> 28:45.590
Yeah, where is
the frozen fruit?

28:45.590 --> 28:47.592
Emory refers to Harold as the frozen fruit

28:47.592 --> 28:50.094
because of his former profession
as an ice skater.

28:50.095 --> 28:53.598
She used to be the Vera Hruba
Ralston of the borscht circuit.

28:53.598 --> 28:55.099
Time for your
rhythm injection.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.103
Now, how did you guess I didn't
want to lie down, Bernard?

28:58.103 --> 28:59.604
You know, if your mother
could see you now,

28:59.604 --> 29:00.605
she'd have a stroke.

29:00.605 --> 29:01.606
You got a camera
on you?

29:01.606 --> 29:03.107
All right, Emily,
up here right now.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.109
Look
out.

29:04.109 --> 29:06.528
Look at those
twinkle toes. Heh.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.697
Oh, my God, it's Lilly Law.

29:09.697 --> 29:10.698
Everyone
three feet apart.

29:10.698 --> 29:12.449
Quiet. Quiet!
It may be Harold.

29:14.035 --> 29:16.420
No, it's the delivery boy
from the bakery.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.423
Ask him if he's got
any hot-crossed buns.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.042
Come on, Emory.
Knock it off, will you?

29:22.043 --> 29:23.627
You can take her
anywhere but out.

29:23.628 --> 29:26.263
You remind me of
an old maid schoolteacher.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.516
You remind me of a chicken wing.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.100
I'm sure you meant that
as a compliment.

29:31.386 --> 29:32.387
Um, thank you.
Good night.

29:38.393 --> 29:40.027
Hey, Bernard? Do you
remember that dance

29:40.028 --> 29:42.030
we used to do
at Fire Island?

29:42.030 --> 29:45.033
Man, that was in so far back,
I think I've forgotten it.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.534
I remember it.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.537
One, two.
One, two.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.538
Oh, Christ.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.540
Single, single.
Dance.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.041
All right.
Whoo!

29:54.042 --> 29:56.744
Wait a minute.
One, two, three, four.

29:56.744 --> 29:58.746
It's the geriatrics
Rockettes.

30:00.415 --> 30:02.417
Get 'em up there,
huh, babe. Whoo!

30:02.417 --> 30:03.918
One, two.
Who dreamed this up?

30:03.918 --> 30:05.419
Emory.

30:05.420 --> 30:08.506
It's the sensational
Menstruations.

30:10.725 --> 30:12.259
Come on, Donald.
Get in here.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.010
Ah!

30:13.011 --> 30:14.679

30:14.679 --> 30:15.730
Very funny.

30:20.185 --> 30:21.102

30:22.437 --> 30:23.488

Um, Emory was just showing us--
When I walked past,

31:19.410 --> 31:20.577
the downstairs door
was open,

31:20.578 --> 31:22.162
so I just--
Oh, excuse me. This is Emory.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.250
Hello.

31:26.334 --> 31:29.337
Everybody, this is
Alan McCarthy.

31:29.337 --> 31:31.922
Alan, um--
Counterclockwise.

31:31.923 --> 31:34.425
Larry and Emory,
and Bernard...

31:34.425 --> 31:36.477
How are you?
...Donald and Hank.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.262
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.315
Uh, well, can I get you
a drink?

31:41.316 --> 31:43.318
Uh, Scotch, please.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.402
Fine.
Uh-- I'll get it.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.404
Oh. Thank you,
Donald.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.406
Well, I guess I'm the only
beer drinker here tonight.

31:52.193 --> 31:54.912
Whose, uh--
Whose birthday is it?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.781
Oh, it's--
Harold's.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.416
Harold.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.503
He's not here yet.
She's never been on time--

32:02.503 --> 32:05.789
<i>He's</i> never been on time
in <i>his</i> life.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.291
Uh, H-Hank.
Alan is from Washington.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.294
Washington.
We went to college together.

32:09.294 --> 32:10.378
Georgetown.

32:10.378 --> 32:12.213
Isn't that
fascinating?

32:12.213 --> 32:13.797
Here. If that's too strong,

32:13.798 --> 32:14.799
I'll put some
water in it.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.270
No. It's fine, thanks.
Fine.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.555
Well, Alan, are you in the government then--?

32:21.556 --> 32:22.640
No, I'm a lawyer.
What do you do?

32:22.640 --> 32:24.141
Oh, I teach
school.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.144
Oh, I would've taken you for
an athlete of some sort.

32:26.144 --> 32:28.146
You look like you might
play sports of some sort.

32:28.146 --> 32:29.647
Well, I'm
no professional.

32:29.647 --> 32:31.649
I was on the basketball team in
college, and I do play tennis.

32:31.649 --> 32:33.651
Well, I play tennis too.
It's a great game.

32:33.651 --> 32:34.652
Yeah, that's great.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.872
Uh, yeah, it's a great game.

32:39.741 --> 32:41.743
What, uh... W-- What do
you teach?

32:41.743 --> 32:42.744
Math.
Math?

32:42.744 --> 32:44.579
Yeah.
Math, well...

32:44.579 --> 32:47.582
Makes you wanna rush out and buy
a slide rule, doesn't it?

32:47.582 --> 32:50.418
Uh, excuse me, Alan,
I'll be right back.

32:50.418 --> 32:52.503
Come on, Emory. I'm gonna need
some help in the kitchen.

32:52.503 --> 32:53.720
You're elected.

32:53.721 --> 32:56.306
I'm always elected.
You're a natural-born domestic.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.808
Said the African
queen.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.311
You come on too. You can fan me
while I make the salad dressing.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.813
Right this way,
Emory. Come on.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.906
Oh, hey,
look, uh...

33:11.906 --> 33:13.908
why don't we all
sit down over here?

33:13.908 --> 33:14.909
Sure.

33:24.919 --> 33:27.922
I, uh... I really feel terrible
about barging in

33:27.922 --> 33:29.423
on you fellows
this way.

33:34.128 --> 33:35.929
Well, that's perfectly
all right, Alan.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.265
Hi.
Hi.

33:42.970 --> 33:43.971
Hey, you're married?

33:45.973 --> 33:47.975
What?
I see you're married.

33:47.975 --> 33:49.526
Oh. Yes.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.612
Yes, Hank's married.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.113
Donald.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.115
Come up with some ice.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.483
Excuse me.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.460
Oh!

34:12.132 --> 34:14.502
Do you, uh--
Do you have any kids?

34:15.386 --> 34:18.054
Yes. Yes, I have two.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.757
I have a boy, nine,
and a girl, seven.

34:20.757 --> 34:22.309
They're great kids too.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.393
You should see my boy
play tennis.

34:23.393 --> 34:24.928
He really puts
his dad to shame.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.513
I've got two kids too.
Both girls.

34:26.514 --> 34:28.315
Hey, that's great.
How are the girls, Alan?

34:28.315 --> 34:30.400
Oh, they're just sensational.
They're...

34:30.400 --> 34:32.018
really something, those kids.
God, I'm--

34:32.018 --> 34:33.603
I'm nuts
about them.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.076
Well, Alan, um, how long have
you been married, then?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.527
Nine years.
Mm-hm.

34:39.527 --> 34:40.911
Can you believe it, Mickey?
No.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.030
Mickey used to go with my wife
when we were all in school.

34:43.030 --> 34:44.197
Can you believe that?

34:51.539 --> 34:53.541
Do you, uh...

34:53.541 --> 34:55.509
Do you live
in the city?

34:55.510 --> 34:57.211
Uh, yes, we do.

34:57.211 --> 35:00.297
I'm in the process
of getting a divorce. Uh...

35:00.298 --> 35:01.882
Larry and I are roommates
for the moment.

35:01.883 --> 35:02.884
Yes.

35:04.385 --> 35:06.603
I'm sorry, I-I--
I didn't mean to--

35:06.604 --> 35:08.188
No, no, it's perfectly
all right. I understand.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.489
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here. Let--

35:28.493 --> 35:31.496
Oh. Can I
help you, Alan?

35:31.496 --> 35:33.998
I can't seem to find
the Scotch. Uh...

35:33.998 --> 35:36.000
Well, you've got it
in your hand.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.469
Oh, where the hell
could Harold be?

35:38.469 --> 35:39.553
He's always
late.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.055
But why does it take Harold
hours to get ready

35:41.055 --> 35:42.556
before he can go out?

35:42.557 --> 35:45.009
Because she's a sick lady,
that's why.

35:46.093 --> 35:47.644
Alan, we can go
to my bedroom and talk.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.146
I'm just gonna
finish this and go.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.648
Come on, bring
your drink.

35:53.651 --> 35:54.652
I've finished it.

35:54.652 --> 35:55.653
Oh.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.665
Excuse us. We'll be down
in just a minute.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.666
Sure. Sure.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.501
Oh, um...he'll still
be here.

36:11.919 --> 36:12.920
This way, Alan.

36:22.129 --> 36:24.131
Now, just what was that
supposed to mean?

36:25.633 --> 36:28.135
What was what
supposed to mean?

36:28.135 --> 36:30.137
You know, that little--
Hey, you want another beer?

36:30.137 --> 36:32.189
Hey. You're jealous,
aren't you?

36:34.725 --> 36:35.692
No.

36:38.112 --> 36:40.948
I'm Larry.
You're jealous.

36:42.783 --> 36:45.902
The last time I saw you,
you were on your way to...

36:45.903 --> 36:48.906
California, or--
Or was it Europe?

36:48.906 --> 36:50.407
Hollywood.

36:50.408 --> 36:52.410
Which is not in Europe, and
which has nothing whatsoever

36:52.410 --> 36:53.911
to do with
California.

36:53.911 --> 36:56.914
Well, I've-- I've never
been there myself,

36:56.914 --> 36:58.916
but I would imagine
it must be awful.

36:58.916 --> 37:00.417
Everyone must be...

37:00.418 --> 37:01.635
terribly cheap.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.505
No. Not everyone.

37:04.505 --> 37:06.840
Alan...

37:06.841 --> 37:08.342
I'd like to try to
explain about tonight.

37:08.342 --> 37:09.843
What's to explain?

37:09.844 --> 37:14.932
Sometimes you can't invite
everyone to every party,

37:14.932 --> 37:16.767
and some people
take it personally.

37:16.767 --> 37:20.020
But I-- I'm not
one of them. I...

37:20.021 --> 37:21.989
should apologize
for inviting myself.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.573
Well, that's not
exactly what I meant.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.075
Your friends,
uh...

37:25.076 --> 37:28.829
Your friends all seem like
very nice guys.

37:28.829 --> 37:29.913
That, uh...

37:29.914 --> 37:32.783
That Hank, he's really
a very attractive fellow.

37:33.668 --> 37:34.535
Yes, he is.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.924
We've got a lot in common.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.926
What's his roommate's name?

37:43.928 --> 37:45.429
Larry.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.463
And what does he do?

37:46.464 --> 37:47.965
He's a fashion photographer.

37:49.383 --> 37:50.884
And I like Donald too.

37:50.885 --> 37:55.389
The only one I didn't seem to
care too much for is...

37:55.389 --> 37:58.892
wh-wh-what's
his name? Uh...Emory?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.780
Yes. Emory.

38:04.231 --> 38:05.782
Well, I just can't
stand that kind of talk.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.785
It just
grates on me.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.790
Uh, what kind of talk, Alan?

38:12.790 --> 38:16.293
You know what
I mean. His...

38:16.294 --> 38:17.795
His brand of humor,
I suppose.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.164
Well, he can be
quite funny sometimes.

38:20.164 --> 38:22.666
I suppose so, if you find
that sort of thing amusing.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.169
It's just that he seems like
such a goddamn little pansy.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.979
I'm-- I'm s--
I'm sorry I said that. I--

38:38.983 --> 38:40.985
I didn't mean to say that.
That's such an awful thing

38:40.985 --> 38:41.986
to say about anyone.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.604
You know what
I mean, Michael.

38:43.604 --> 38:45.155
You must admit,
he is effeminate.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.075
Yes, he is a bit.

38:48.075 --> 38:49.276
A bit?

38:50.861 --> 38:53.864
Why-- Why he's like a--

38:53.864 --> 38:55.866
He's like
a butterfly in heat.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.088
I mean, it's-- It's no wonder
that he was trying

39:01.088 --> 39:02.089
to teach you all to dance.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.591
He probably wanted to
dance with you.

39:09.797 --> 39:12.299
Oh, come on, man. You--

39:12.299 --> 39:15.218
You know me.
You know how I feel.

39:15.219 --> 39:16.637
Your...

39:16.637 --> 39:19.139
Your private life
is your own affair.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.642
No, I don't know
that about you.

39:24.645 --> 39:26.146
Well, I--

39:26.147 --> 39:30.151
I couldn't care less
about what people do, as...

39:30.151 --> 39:31.535
As long as they don't
do it in public,

39:31.535 --> 39:34.120
or try to force their ways
on the whole damned world.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.625
Alan, what were you
crying about on the telephone?

39:46.584 --> 39:47.635
All I--

39:50.638 --> 39:52.640
All I can say is,
please forgive me

39:52.640 --> 39:54.058
for making
such an ass of myself.

39:59.346 --> 40:00.347
You must have been upset,

40:00.347 --> 40:02.849
or you wouldn't have said
that you were.

40:02.850 --> 40:05.068
That you were upset
and that you wanted to see me.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.020
Had to see me,
and talk to me.

40:07.021 --> 40:08.238
Michael, please.

40:10.324 --> 40:12.159
Is something wrong
between you and Fran?

40:14.995 --> 40:16.413
Listen,
I've really got to go.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.364
Why are you in New York?

40:18.783 --> 40:21.285
I'm dreadfully late
for dinner, Michael.

40:21.285 --> 40:24.087
Whose dinner?
Where are you going?

40:29.176 --> 40:30.760
Oh, no!
Oh! Here.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.129
Come on.

40:32.129 --> 40:33.180
Here, I'll get the--

40:33.180 --> 40:35.048
Uh-oh. Denise Deluge.

40:35.049 --> 40:37.468
Oh, great.
Now it's stopped.

40:39.887 --> 40:41.471
Oh, Hank.

40:41.472 --> 40:43.056
Why don't you
come and join us?

40:45.559 --> 40:48.028
Well, that's an interesting
suggestion. Whose idea was that?

40:48.979 --> 40:50.981
Well, mine.

40:50.981 --> 40:52.782
He means
in the conversation.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.570
To your health.

40:56.570 --> 40:58.455
Up yours.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.824
Up my health?

41:01.125 --> 41:02.126
Where's the gent?

41:02.126 --> 41:03.627
In the gents' room.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.131
If you can hang on
for five more minutes,

41:07.131 --> 41:08.132
he's about to leave.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.134
Well, at last.

41:13.637 --> 41:16.973
♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you ♪

41:16.974 --> 41:19.559
♪ Happy birthday, dear Harold
Happy birthday to you ♪

41:19.560 --> 41:20.844
Don't--

41:20.845 --> 41:23.230
Who the hell are you?
Well, uh--

41:23.230 --> 41:25.315
She's Harold's present
from me, and she's early.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.318
And that's not even Harold,
you idiot!

41:27.318 --> 41:29.353
Well, you said
whoever answered the door.

41:29.353 --> 41:30.854
But not until
midnight.

41:30.855 --> 41:33.073
He's supposed to be
a midnight cowboy.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.276
He is a midnight
cowboy.

41:36.277 --> 41:38.362
He looks right out of a
William Inge play, doesn't he?

41:38.362 --> 41:40.781
Not until midnight,
and you're supposed to sing

41:40.781 --> 41:42.783
to the right person,
for chrissakes. I told you,

41:42.783 --> 41:46.002
Harold has very, very tight,
tight black curly hair.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.754
This number's
practically bald.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.956
Thank you, and fuck you.

41:48.956 --> 41:50.457
Good thing I didn't
open the door.

41:50.457 --> 41:52.542
Not that tight
and not that black.

41:52.543 --> 41:54.545
Aw, I forgot.

41:54.545 --> 41:57.214
And besides, I-I want to get
to the bars by midnight.

41:57.214 --> 41:58.848
He's a class act,
all the way around.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.433
What do you mean,
"get to the bars"?

42:00.434 --> 42:03.220
Sweetie, I paid you for
the whole evening, remember?

42:03.220 --> 42:05.305
Oh, I hurt my back
doing my exercises,

42:05.306 --> 42:07.274
and I want to get
to bed early tonight.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.358
Are you ready
for this one?

42:08.359 --> 42:10.894
Well, that's too bad.
What happened?

42:10.895 --> 42:12.980
I, uh... Heh.

42:12.980 --> 42:14.982
I-I lost my grip
doing my chin-ups,

42:14.982 --> 42:16.984
and I fell on my heels
and twisted my back.

42:16.984 --> 42:19.369
You shouldn't wear heels
when you do chin-ups.

42:24.458 --> 42:25.959
I-I shouldn't do
chin-ups.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.461
I have a weak grip
to begin with.

42:27.461 --> 42:30.747
A weak grip. In my day it used
to be called a limp wrist.

42:30.748 --> 42:33.167
Who can remember
that far back?

42:33.167 --> 42:34.251
Who was it who always
used to say,

42:34.251 --> 42:36.753
"You show me Oscar Wilde
in a cowboy suit,

42:36.754 --> 42:39.256
and I'll show you
a gay caballero"?

42:39.256 --> 42:41.258
I don't know. Who was it
who always used to say that?

42:41.258 --> 42:42.676
I don't know. Somebody.

42:42.676 --> 42:44.561
What does your card say?

42:44.562 --> 42:46.263
Uh, Y-you read it.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.737
"Dear Harold, bang, bang, you're alive,

42:53.737 --> 42:55.739
"but roll over
and play dead.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.774
Happy birthday. Emory."

42:57.775 --> 42:59.159
Sheer poetry, Emmy.

42:59.159 --> 43:01.244
And in your
usual good taste.

43:01.245 --> 43:04.998
Yes. And so conservative to have
resisted a sign in Times Square.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.368
Cheese it! Here comes
the socialite nun.

43:07.368 --> 43:08.252
Damn it, Emory, shut up.

43:10.337 --> 43:12.672
Well, I'm off, Michael.

43:14.041 --> 43:15.542
Thank you
for the drink.

43:16.543 --> 43:19.045
You're entirely welcome,
Alan.

43:20.047 --> 43:21.548
See you tomorrow?

43:21.548 --> 43:23.132
No. I think I'm gonna
be awfully busy.

43:23.133 --> 43:25.635
I...may even go back
to Washington.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.888
Got a heavy date
in Lafayette Square?

43:27.888 --> 43:29.055
Emory.
What?

43:29.056 --> 43:29.890
Forget it.

43:32.726 --> 43:34.644
Oh, are, uh--
Are you Harold?

43:36.063 --> 43:38.865
No, he's not Harold.
He's for Harold.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.371
Goodbye, Hank. It was
awfully nice meeting you.

43:44.371 --> 43:46.456
Same here, Alan.
If you ever get to Washington,

43:46.457 --> 43:48.709
I'd like you to meet my wife.
Right. Good.

43:48.709 --> 43:49.993
Oh, that'd be fun,
wouldn't it, Hank?

43:49.994 --> 43:52.796
Mm. They'd love to
meet him. Uh, her.

43:52.796 --> 43:55.165
I have such
a problem with pronouns.

43:55.165 --> 43:56.666
How many esses are there
in "pronoun"?

43:56.667 --> 43:59.086
How'd you like to kiss my ass?
Got two or more esses in it.

43:59.086 --> 44:00.420
How'd you like to blow me?

44:00.421 --> 44:01.972
What's the matter?
Your wife got lockjaw?

44:01.972 --> 44:03.556
Faggot! Fairy!

44:03.557 --> 44:05.475
Alan! Alan!

44:09.647 --> 44:10.981
Get some ice.
Get some ice.

44:11.849 --> 44:14.101
Oh, my God!
My nose is broken!

44:14.101 --> 44:15.435
Oh, God! Oh, God!

44:16.403 --> 44:17.904
Knock it off!

44:20.691 --> 44:22.025
Hang on!
You faggot! Faggot!

44:24.278 --> 44:27.331
Aah! Keep him away from me!

44:33.087 --> 44:35.172
Would you mind waiting
over there with the gifts?

44:38.208 --> 44:40.927
I can't breathe!

44:42.463 --> 44:45.549
Well, Harold. Happy Birthday.

44:45.549 --> 44:47.634
You're just in time
for the floor show,

44:47.634 --> 44:49.719
which, as you see,
is on the floor.

44:51.138 --> 44:52.939
Oh, it's Harold.
Now, it's all right.

44:52.940 --> 44:55.609
Hey you.
This is Harold.

44:55.609 --> 44:57.193
Now, put this up on your chin.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.195
Will it be ruined?

44:58.195 --> 45:00.530
No, it'll be ruined if it swells up.

45:00.531 --> 45:03.951
♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you ♪

45:03.951 --> 45:05.652
♪ Happy birthday
Dear Harold ♪

45:05.652 --> 45:07.036
♪ Happy birthday
To you ♪

45:24.671 --> 45:26.005
What's so fucking funny?

45:27.307 --> 45:29.309
Life.

45:29.309 --> 45:32.312
Life's a goddamn
laugh riot.

45:32.312 --> 45:34.314
You remember life.

45:34.314 --> 45:35.598
You're stoned.

45:35.599 --> 45:36.683
Happy Birthday, Harold.

45:36.683 --> 45:38.401
You're stoned, and you're late.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.936
You were supposed to
arrive at this location

45:39.937 --> 45:43.073
at approximately 8:30,
dash 9:00.

45:44.575 --> 45:47.578
What I am, Michael,
is a 32-year-old

45:47.578 --> 45:50.581
ugly, pockmarked,
Jew fairy.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.584
And if it takes me a while
to pull myself together,

45:53.584 --> 45:55.586
and if I smoke
a little grass

45:55.586 --> 45:58.589
before I get up the nerve
to show my face to the world,

45:58.589 --> 46:02.092
it's nobody's goddamn
business but my own.

46:03.594 --> 46:05.596
And how are you
this evening?

46:10.434 --> 46:12.352
Happy Birthday, Hallie.

46:12.352 --> 46:14.387
What happened
to you?

46:14.388 --> 46:15.972
Don't ask.

46:15.973 --> 46:17.975
Your lips
are turning blue.

46:17.975 --> 46:20.527
You look like you've been
rimming a snowman.

46:20.527 --> 46:23.112
That piss-elegant
cooz in there hit me.

46:23.113 --> 46:24.114
Careful, Emory.

46:24.114 --> 46:26.065
That kind of talk just
makes him so nervous.

46:28.819 --> 46:29.820
Who is she?

46:32.322 --> 46:34.324
Who was she?

46:35.325 --> 46:37.210
Who does she hope to be?

46:37.211 --> 46:38.829
Who knows, who cares.

46:38.829 --> 46:40.630
His name is Alan McCarthy.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.716
Not the famous
college chum?

46:42.716 --> 46:45.218
Is this my surprise
from you, Michael?

46:45.219 --> 46:47.337
I think Alan's the one
who got the surprise.

46:47.337 --> 46:49.972
And if you'll notice,
he's absolutely speechless.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.558
Oh, she's in shock.
She's a beast.

46:52.559 --> 46:53.927
That's your surprise.

46:53.927 --> 46:55.645
Uh, speaking of beasts.

46:55.646 --> 46:58.065
From me to you, darling.
How do you like it?

47:13.997 --> 47:17.000
Well, I suppose he has an
interesting face and body,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.002
but it turns me right off,

47:19.002 --> 47:21.454
because he can't talk
intelligently about art.

47:21.455 --> 47:23.173
Yeah, ain't it a shame?

47:23.173 --> 47:25.258
I could never
love anyone like that.

47:25.259 --> 47:27.261
Never. Who could?

47:27.261 --> 47:29.263
I could and you could.
That's who could.

47:30.380 --> 47:32.382
Mary, she's gorgeous.

47:32.382 --> 47:34.467
She may be dumb,
but she's all yours.

47:34.468 --> 47:37.187
In affairs of the heart,
there are no rules.

47:38.889 --> 47:42.309
I'm so thrilled to get it,
I could kiss you.

47:42.309 --> 47:44.778
But I don't wanna
get blood all over me.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.698
Oh, look at
my sweater.

47:47.698 --> 47:49.149
Wait'll you see
your face.

47:49.149 --> 47:51.701
Come on, Emory,
let's get you cleaned up.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.787
Happy birthday, Harold.
Thanks, love.

47:53.787 --> 47:55.572
My sweater's ruined.

47:55.572 --> 47:57.156
Take one of mine
in the bedroom.

47:57.157 --> 47:59.159
Oh, the one on
the floor is vicuña.

47:59.159 --> 48:00.577
My sweater's ruined.

48:00.577 --> 48:03.329
Come on. You'll feel better after I bathe your face.

48:03.330 --> 48:05.832
Just another birthday party
with the folks.

48:08.669 --> 48:10.170
Here's a cold bottle
of pouilly-fuissé

48:10.170 --> 48:12.172
I bought especially
for you, kiddo.

48:13.674 --> 48:14.675
Pussycat.

48:15.676 --> 48:18.679
All is forgiven.
You can stay.

48:18.679 --> 48:20.347
Ah.

48:20.347 --> 48:23.900
No, you can stay,
but not all is forgiven.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.018
Cheers.

48:25.018 --> 48:26.602
I feel sick. I think
I'm gonna throw up.

48:26.603 --> 48:28.404
Wait a minute.
Say that again,

48:28.405 --> 48:30.824
and I won't have to take
my appetite depressant.

48:30.824 --> 48:32.492
All right, up the steps,
to the john. Right?

48:32.492 --> 48:35.077
Easy does it.
One step at a time.

48:37.531 --> 48:40.116
There.
Feel better?

48:54.514 --> 48:57.517
I'm not ready for my close-up,
Mr. DeMille.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.519
Nor will I be
for the next two weeks.

49:01.438 --> 49:02.806
Oh, my God,
he's after me again!

49:08.111 --> 49:10.113
Turning on.

49:13.650 --> 49:15.652
Anybody care to join me?

49:27.164 --> 49:29.166
Many thanks. No.

49:30.667 --> 49:32.669
How about
you, Tex?

49:32.669 --> 49:34.671
Yeah.

49:36.673 --> 49:39.392
Michael, I left
the casserole in the oven.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.477
You can
take it out anytime.

49:40.477 --> 49:41.644
You're not going.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.730
I couldn't
eat now anyway.

49:43.730 --> 49:45.765
Well, I'm absolutely
ravenous.

49:45.766 --> 49:48.485
I'm going to eat until
I have a fat attack.

49:48.485 --> 49:49.569
I said, you're not going.

49:50.103 --> 49:53.189
Beware the hostile fag.

49:53.190 --> 49:55.692
When he's sober,
he's dangerous.

49:55.692 --> 49:58.695
When he drinks, he's lethal.

49:58.695 --> 50:01.447
Attention must not be paid.

50:01.448 --> 50:03.450
I'm starved, Em.

50:03.450 --> 50:05.535
I'm ready for some of your

50:05.535 --> 50:08.955
Alice B. Toklas
opium-baked lasagna.

50:08.955 --> 50:12.041
Are you really?
Oh, that makes me so happy.

50:12.042 --> 50:14.427
Maybe I'll just
serve before I leave.

50:14.428 --> 50:16.012
Nobody's
going anywhere.

50:16.013 --> 50:18.515
You are going to have
<i>schmertz</i> tomorrow

50:18.515 --> 50:21.518
you wouldn't believe.
Do a figure eight on that.

50:22.686 --> 50:25.188
I'm turning on,
and you're just turning.

50:25.188 --> 50:27.106
Michael, is there
any air spray?

50:27.107 --> 50:29.692
Hair spray? You're supposed
to be holding his head,

50:29.693 --> 50:31.111
not doing his hair.

50:31.111 --> 50:32.946
"Air" spray. Not hair spray.

50:32.946 --> 50:35.148
There's a can of floral spray
right on top of the john.

50:35.148 --> 50:36.232
Right. Thanks.

50:37.784 --> 50:40.870
I keep my grass
in the medicine cabinet,

50:40.871 --> 50:41.872
in the Band-Aid
box.

50:43.373 --> 50:45.875
Somebody told me
it's the safest place.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.377
If the cops arrive,

50:47.377 --> 50:48.878
you can always lock yourself
in the bathroom

50:48.879 --> 50:51.164
and flush it down the john.

50:51.164 --> 50:52.632
Very cagey.

50:52.632 --> 50:55.217
Makes more sense
than where I was keeping it:

50:55.218 --> 50:58.221
in an oregano jar
in the spice rack.

51:00.090 --> 51:01.674
I kept forgetting
and accidentally

51:01.675 --> 51:05.178
turning my hateful mother on
with the salad. Hm.

51:05.178 --> 51:06.679
But I think she liked it.

51:06.680 --> 51:09.182
No matter what meal
she comes over for,

51:09.182 --> 51:10.683
even if it's breakfast,
she says:

51:10.684 --> 51:12.185
"Let's have a salad."

51:14.071 --> 51:17.657
I bet you move your lips
when you read.

51:17.657 --> 51:19.659
I bet you sit in the steam room
and say things like,

51:19.659 --> 51:21.077
"Hot enough for you?"

51:21.078 --> 51:24.164
I don't use the steam room
when I go to the gym.

51:24.164 --> 51:27.116
It's bad for you after
a workout. Flattens you down.

51:27.117 --> 51:29.702
Just after you've broken
your back to blow yourself up.

51:29.703 --> 51:32.455
Like a poisoned dog.

51:32.456 --> 51:33.507
Yeah.

51:34.458 --> 51:36.460
Oh, Harold,
he's beautiful.

51:36.460 --> 51:39.463
Yeah. Beautiful.

51:39.463 --> 51:42.466
He has unnatural
natural beauty.

51:43.467 --> 51:45.852
Not that
that means anything.

51:45.852 --> 51:47.353
It doesn't mean everything.

51:47.354 --> 51:51.107
Keep telling yourself that as
your hair drops out in handfuls.

51:51.108 --> 51:53.193
Faggots are worse than
women about their age.

51:53.193 --> 51:56.196
They think their lives
are over at 30.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.448
Physical beauty is not
all that goddamn important.

51:58.448 --> 52:00.533
Of course not,
how could it be?

52:00.534 --> 52:02.819
It's only in the eye
of the beholder.

52:04.204 --> 52:05.622
And it's only skin deep.

52:07.073 --> 52:09.575
Only skin deep.

52:09.576 --> 52:11.578
And it's transitory too.

52:11.578 --> 52:14.047
It's terribly transitory.

52:15.632 --> 52:20.219
Oh, yes. It's too bad about
this poor boy's face.

52:21.221 --> 52:22.722
It's tragic.

52:22.722 --> 52:25.508
He's absolutely cursed.

52:26.810 --> 52:31.264
How could his beauty
ever compare with my soul?

52:31.264 --> 52:33.849
And although
I've never seen my soul,

52:33.850 --> 52:36.352
I understand
from my mother's rabbi

52:36.353 --> 52:37.737
that it's a knockout.

52:37.737 --> 52:41.690
I, however, cannot seem
to locate it for a gander.

52:41.691 --> 52:44.193
And if I could...

52:44.194 --> 52:47.197
I'd sell it in a flash...

52:47.197 --> 52:50.200
for some skin-deep,
transitory,

52:50.200 --> 52:51.951
meaningless beauty.

52:51.952 --> 52:54.537
Forgive him, father,
for he know not what he do.

52:55.755 --> 52:59.258
Michael, you don't know what
side of the fence you're on.

52:59.259 --> 53:02.262
Say something pro-religion,
you're against it.

53:02.262 --> 53:05.265
Deny God, you're
against that.

53:05.265 --> 53:08.768
One might say you have
some problem in that area.

53:08.768 --> 53:11.270
You can't live with it,
and you can't live without it.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.772
Hot stuff coming through.

53:12.772 --> 53:15.524
One could murder you
with very little effort.

53:15.525 --> 53:18.110
You hang on to that
great insurance policy

53:18.111 --> 53:19.362
called the Church.

53:19.362 --> 53:21.447
That's right.
I believe in God.

53:21.448 --> 53:25.201
And if it turns out there
isn't one, okay, nothing's lost.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.370
But if it turns out
there really is, I'm covered.

53:27.370 --> 53:29.405
Harriet Hypocrite,
that's who you are.

53:29.406 --> 53:31.991
Right. I'm one of those
truly rotten Catholics

53:31.992 --> 53:32.993
who gets drunk,
sins all night,

53:32.993 --> 53:34.828
and then goes to Mass
the next morning.

53:34.828 --> 53:38.214
Gilda Guilt. It all depends
on what you think sin is.

53:38.215 --> 53:40.300
Will you just shut up
your goddamn minty mouth

53:40.300 --> 53:42.302
and get back
in the goddamn kitchen?

53:42.302 --> 53:44.804
Say anything you want.
Just don't hit me.

53:47.807 --> 53:50.476
Well. Is it bigger
than a bread stick?

53:50.477 --> 53:53.062
He's lying down
for a minute, Michael.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.065
How does
the bathroom smell?

53:55.065 --> 53:56.649
Better.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.234
Before, it smelled like
somebody puked.

53:58.235 --> 54:01.104
Now it smells like somebody
puked in a gardenia patch.

54:01.104 --> 54:03.523
Dinner is served.

54:03.523 --> 54:05.358
Bread. Isn't that great?

54:05.358 --> 54:08.361
Emory, it looks
absolutely fabulous.

54:08.361 --> 54:10.279
I'd make somebody
a good wife.

54:10.280 --> 54:14.000
I could cook. I could
do an apartment and, um...

54:14.000 --> 54:16.002
I could entertain.

54:16.002 --> 54:18.454
Kiss me quick, I'm Carmen.

54:20.924 --> 54:24.010
One really needs castanets
for that sort of thing.

54:24.010 --> 54:25.711
And a getaway car.

54:25.712 --> 54:27.296
What are you having,
big boy?

54:27.297 --> 54:29.432
Alan McCarthy,
and don't hold the mayo.

54:29.432 --> 54:31.350
Oh, I can't keep up with you two.

54:31.351 --> 54:33.886
First you're mad at him, now
he's bitchin' you. What gives?

54:33.887 --> 54:35.104
Never mind.

54:35.105 --> 54:37.557
W-what is it?
Lasagna.

54:37.557 --> 54:39.141
Uh, it looks like
spaghetti and meatballs,

54:39.142 --> 54:40.643
all sort of flattened out.

54:40.644 --> 54:42.646
It's been
in the steam room.

54:42.646 --> 54:43.647
It has?

54:45.649 --> 54:47.484
It looks like spaghetti
and meatballs,

54:47.484 --> 54:49.068
all sort of
flattened out.

54:49.069 --> 54:51.704
Oh, yes, Harold.
Truly enviable.

54:51.705 --> 54:55.792
As opposed to you, who knows
so much about haute cuisine.

54:55.792 --> 54:59.212
Raconteur, gourmet, troll.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.883
It's good.
You like it? Eat it.

55:03.883 --> 55:05.918
Stuff your mouth
so you can't say anything.

55:05.919 --> 55:07.136
Turning!

55:07.137 --> 55:08.721
Wine?
No, thanks. Water.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.724
Oh, go on, kiddo,
force yourself.

55:10.724 --> 55:11.725
Have a little
vin ordinaire

55:11.725 --> 55:13.927
to wash down all
that depressed pasta.

55:13.927 --> 55:17.430
Sommelier,
connoisseur, pig.

55:17.430 --> 55:20.232
Aren't you gonna have some of that fantastic sauce you made?

55:20.233 --> 55:22.602
No. My lip hurts
too much to eat.

55:22.602 --> 55:25.187
I hear that if you puts a knife under the bed,

55:25.188 --> 55:27.406
it cuts the pain.

55:27.407 --> 55:28.991
I hear if you put
a knife under your chin,

55:28.992 --> 55:30.777
it cuts your throat.

55:32.612 --> 55:34.614
Is anyone going to
bring a plate up to Alan?

55:34.614 --> 55:37.917
The punching bag has now
dissolved into Flo Nightingale.

55:39.202 --> 55:40.786
Ladies and gentlemen.

55:40.787 --> 55:42.672
Oh, correction.

55:42.672 --> 55:44.757
Ladies and ladies.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.760
I would like to announce
that you have just eaten

55:46.760 --> 55:47.677
Sebastian Venable.

55:49.012 --> 55:50.763
Uh, just eaten what?

55:50.764 --> 55:52.849
Well, not what,
stupid. Who.

55:52.849 --> 55:54.851
A character in a play.

55:54.851 --> 55:56.352
A fairy who got eaten alive.

55:59.055 --> 56:00.473
I mean the chop, chop variety.

56:01.775 --> 56:04.611
Hm. Jesus.

56:04.611 --> 56:07.280
Emory, how much
did you pay for him?

56:07.280 --> 56:09.065
He was a steal.

56:09.065 --> 56:10.649
He's a ham sandwich.

56:10.650 --> 56:13.152
Fifty cents, any time
of the day or night.

56:13.153 --> 56:16.206
King of the pig people.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.790
Would you like
some more, Donald?

56:17.791 --> 56:19.492
Uh, no thanks, Emory.
It was very good though.

56:19.492 --> 56:21.544
Did you like it?

56:21.544 --> 56:25.331
I'm not a steal.
I cost $20.

56:27.133 --> 56:28.217
The cake?

56:28.218 --> 56:30.720
Well, you go get it.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.422
Isn't anyone going to have seconds?

56:33.423 --> 56:36.592
I'm having seconds,
and thirds,

56:36.593 --> 56:38.177
and maybe even
fifths.

56:38.178 --> 56:41.014
I'm absolutely desperate
to keep the weight up.

56:41.014 --> 56:44.934
You're absolutely paranoid
about absolutely everything.

56:44.934 --> 56:46.602
Oh, yeah?

56:49.105 --> 56:51.991
Well, why don't you
not tell me about it?

56:53.359 --> 56:55.361
You starve yourself
all day,

56:55.361 --> 56:57.863
living on coffee
and cottage cheese,

56:57.864 --> 57:00.867
so that you can gorge
yourself at one meal.

57:00.867 --> 57:03.369
And then you feel guilty,
and moan and piss

57:03.369 --> 57:05.371
about how fat you are,
and how ugly you are.

57:05.371 --> 57:06.872
When the truth is,
you're not fatter

57:06.873 --> 57:08.457
and no thinner
than you ever are.

57:08.458 --> 57:09.509
Polly Paranoia.

57:10.460 --> 57:12.128
Just great, Emory.
Thank you.

57:12.128 --> 57:15.214
Connie Casserole,
no trouble at all.

57:15.215 --> 57:16.633
Oh, Mary, don't ask.

57:16.633 --> 57:18.551
And this
pathological lateness.

57:18.551 --> 57:20.135
It's downright
crazy.

57:20.136 --> 57:21.554
Turning.

57:21.554 --> 57:25.057
Standing in front of a bathroom
mirror for hours and hours

57:25.058 --> 57:27.310
before you can walk out
onto the street?

57:27.310 --> 57:28.811
And then looking
no different.

57:28.812 --> 57:30.697
After Christ knows
how many applications

57:30.697 --> 57:32.281
of Christ knows
how many ointments,

57:32.282 --> 57:34.317
and salves
and creams and masks.

57:34.317 --> 57:36.902
I've got bad skin.
What can I tell you?

57:36.903 --> 57:38.487
Who wouldn't after
they deliberately

57:38.488 --> 57:39.989
take a pair of tweezers

57:39.989 --> 57:42.491
and deliberately
mutilate their pores.

57:42.492 --> 57:44.494
No wonder you've got
holes in your face,

57:44.494 --> 57:46.996
after the hack job
you've done on yourself.

57:46.996 --> 57:48.547
Year in and
year out.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.716
You hateful sow.

57:50.717 --> 57:52.301
Yes, you've got scars
on your face,

57:52.302 --> 57:53.803
but they're not that bad.

57:53.803 --> 57:55.805
And if you'd
leave yourself alone,

57:55.805 --> 57:58.340
you wouldn't have any more than
you've already awarded yourself.

57:58.341 --> 57:59.925
You'd really like me
to compliment you now

57:59.926 --> 58:02.144
for being so honest,
wouldn't you?

58:02.145 --> 58:04.230
For being my best friend,

58:04.230 --> 58:06.515
who will tell me what even
my best friends won't tell me.

58:09.819 --> 58:11.353
Slut.

58:11.354 --> 58:13.439
And the pills.

58:13.439 --> 58:15.441
Harold has been
gathering and storing

58:15.441 --> 58:17.943
and saving up barbiturates
for the past year

58:17.944 --> 58:20.446
like a goddamn squirrel.

58:20.446 --> 58:23.449
Hundreds of Nembutals,
hundreds of Seconals.

58:23.449 --> 58:26.618
All in preparation for
and anticipation of

58:26.619 --> 58:28.504
the long winter
of his death.

58:28.505 --> 58:30.089
Well, I'll tell you
something, Hallie.

58:30.089 --> 58:32.007
When the time comes,
you won't have the guts.

58:32.008 --> 58:34.377
It's not always
like it happens in plays.

58:34.377 --> 58:38.848
Not all faggots bump themselves
off at the end of the story.

58:43.720 --> 58:45.722
What you're saying
may be true.

58:45.722 --> 58:48.725
Time will
undoubtedly tell.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.727
In the meantime,
you've left out one detail.

58:52.061 --> 58:54.146
The cosmetics and astringents
are paid for.

58:54.147 --> 58:57.150
The bathroom is paid for.
The tweezers are paid for.

58:57.150 --> 58:58.568
And the pills are paid for.

59:11.331 --> 59:14.217
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

59:14.217 --> 59:16.836
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

59:16.836 --> 59:21.223
♪ Happy birthday, dear Harold ♪

59:21.224 --> 59:26.262
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

59:26.262 --> 59:28.180
Blow out your candles,
Mary, and make a wish.

59:32.068 --> 59:34.987
Aw, he's 32 years young!

59:39.492 --> 59:40.993
Come over here, Harold.

59:41.995 --> 59:43.997
Surprise!

59:43.997 --> 59:46.082
- Oh, my God, they're beautiful.
- Take one.

59:46.082 --> 59:48.451
All right,
I'll take the red one.

59:48.451 --> 59:50.286
I'll take...

59:50.286 --> 59:51.587
Where's the card?

59:51.588 --> 59:52.872
Oh, what'd you
do with it, Emory?

59:52.872 --> 59:54.506
It's between
my legs. Heh.

59:59.512 --> 01:00:02.181
"From Larry."

01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:03.765
Ohh!

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.361
Oh, it's heaven.
I love it, Larry.

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:17.897
What is it?

01:00:17.897 --> 01:00:20.816
It's the deed
to Boardwalk.

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:21.617
Gay pop art.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.236
Butchest thing
you've ever seen.

01:00:23.236 --> 01:00:27.123
It is super, Larry.
Did you blow it up yourself?

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:30.326
It goes up
the minute I get home.

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:34.463
I don't get it. You cruise
Atlantic City or something?

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.250
Will somebody

01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:39.135
get him out of here?

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:43.389
Oh.

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:46.058
What a nifty sweater.

01:00:47.927 --> 01:00:49.011
Thank you, Hank.

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:50.513
Well, you know, if you
don't like it, I--

01:00:50.513 --> 01:00:52.014
You can always
take it back and--

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:53.516
And exchange it
for something else.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:56.018
No, I think this one's
just nifty.

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:57.987
It's gorgeous.

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.571
Who wanted cake?

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:01.440
Everyone for cake?
Quick.

01:01:01.441 --> 01:01:02.525
Oh, none for me, please.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.777
No, I'd just like to sleep
on mine, thank you.

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.331
Oh, Bernard,

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.082
how divine.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.169
Look, everybody.
Bejeweled kneepads.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.754
Monogrammed.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:19.208
Bernard,
you're a camp.

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:24.180
You all heard of Gloria De Haven
and Billy De Wolfe?

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.132
Well, this here is
Rosemary De Camp.

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:30.552
Into the sack.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.286
Thank you, Michael.

01:01:47.286 --> 01:01:48.120
What?

01:01:49.455 --> 01:01:50.372
Oh. You're welcome.

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:52.992
Well, what is it, Harold?

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.579
It's a photograph of him...

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:58.080
in a silver frame.

01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:01.584
And there's an inscription
engraved, and the date.

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.085
What's it say?

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:06.089
Just something personal.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.841
Say, Bernard, what do you say
we have a little music

01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:10.309
to liven things up?

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:11.393
Okay.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.262
Yeah, I feel like dancing.

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.346
Uh-oh.

01:02:14.347 --> 01:02:16.349
How about something
good and ethnic, Emory.

01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:17.850
Uh, one of
your specialties.

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:19.852
Like a military toe-tap
with sparklers.

01:02:20.853 --> 01:02:21.854
I don't do that
at birthdays.

01:02:21.854 --> 01:02:24.356
Only on the Fourth
of July.

01:02:30.363 --> 01:02:31.364
Come on, Michael.

01:02:32.865 --> 01:02:34.366
I only lead.

01:02:34.367 --> 01:02:35.868
Well, I can follow.

01:02:38.371 --> 01:02:41.374
No, thanks. I'll just
sit this one out.

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.365
Come on, Tex.
You're on.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.801
Later.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:51.720
Come on. Let's get this stuff
off the terrace.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.422
Hey.

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.626
Come on, Cowboy.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.058
Whoo-hoo.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:59.238
Wanna dance?

01:06:00.239 --> 01:06:02.741
Uh-oh. Ivan
the terrible is back.

01:06:07.246 --> 01:06:09.748
Oh, hello, Alan.
Feel better?

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:13.502
This is where you came in,
isn't it?

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:20.809
Don't rush off in
this inclement weather.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.311
You'll never
get a cab.

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:26.065
Revolution complete.

01:06:28.934 --> 01:06:31.436
You've missed the cake...

01:06:31.437 --> 01:06:35.441
and you've missed
the opening of the gifts...

01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:37.943
but you're still
in luck.

01:06:37.943 --> 01:06:41.446
You're just in time
for a little party game.

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:51.256
Hey, everybody. Game time.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:56.378
Why don't you just
let him go, Michael?

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:59.965
Oh, he can go
if he wants to...

01:06:59.965 --> 01:07:01.967
but not until we've played
a little game.

01:07:01.967 --> 01:07:05.470
movie-star gin?

01:07:06.972 --> 01:07:10.976
No. That's too faggy
for Alan to play.

01:07:12.478 --> 01:07:13.979
He wouldn't be
any good at it.

01:07:13.979 --> 01:07:16.231
What do you
wanna play, Michael?

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:17.816
The Truth Game?

01:07:17.817 --> 01:07:20.152
Cute, Hallie.

01:07:20.152 --> 01:07:22.237
Or do you wanna play Murder?

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.073
You all remember that one,
don't you?

01:07:25.157 --> 01:07:26.908
Very, very cute.

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:28.493
As I recall,
they're similar.

01:07:28.494 --> 01:07:32.464
The rules are the same
in both. You kill somebody.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.166
Mickey, I'm leaving.

01:07:34.166 --> 01:07:35.500
Stay where
you are.

01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:36.585
Michael,
let him go.

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:37.586
He doesn't
really want to.

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.588
If he did, he'd have
left a long time ago.

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:44.593
Or he wouldn't have come
in the first place.

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.063
Mickey, I don't
feel well.

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.068
My name is Michael.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.571
I am called Michael.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:08:00.158
You must never call anyone
called Michael, Mickey.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.660
Those of us
who are named Michael

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.161
get very nervous
about it.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.748
I'm sorry. I can't think.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.500
You can think. What
you can't do is leave.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.587
It's like watching
an accident on the highway.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.956
You can't look at it
and you can't look away.

01:08:42.984 --> 01:08:44.319
Well, now...

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.904
who's gonna play
with Alan and me?

01:08:46.906 --> 01:08:48.908
Everybody?

01:08:48.908 --> 01:08:51.460
I have no intention
of playing.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.961
Nor do I.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.546
Well, not everybody's
a participant in life.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:56.582
There are those who just stand
on the sidelines and watch.

01:08:56.582 --> 01:08:58.050
Well, what's
the game?

01:08:58.050 --> 01:08:59.634
Simply this.

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:04.139
We all have to call
on the telephone the one person

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.642
we truly believed
we have loved.

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:10.979
Oh, well,
I'm not playing then.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.481
Oh, yes, you are.

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.983
Oh, you'd like me to,
wouldn't you?

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.353
You bet I would.

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.937
I'd like to know
who you'd call

01:09:18.938 --> 01:09:22.191
after all those fancy speeches
I've been hearing lately.

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:24.993
Who would
you call?

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.863
Would you call me?

01:09:29.615 --> 01:09:31.116
And who would you call?

01:09:31.116 --> 01:09:32.117
Don't think
I think for one minute

01:09:32.117 --> 01:09:34.118
it would be me
or that one call would do it.

01:09:34.118 --> 01:09:35.620
You'd have to make several,
wouldn't you?

01:09:35.621 --> 01:09:37.622
About three long-distance...

01:09:37.622 --> 01:09:39.591
and God only knows
how many locals.

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:41.676
I-I-I'm glad I don't
have to pay the bill.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:43.261
Quiet.
Oh, don't worry.

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:45.264
Michael won't
pay it either.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:47.015
Now, here's
how it works.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.600
If you make the call,
you get one point.

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.804
If the person you're calling
answers, you get two points.

01:09:51.804 --> 01:09:54.439
If somebody else answers,
you only get one point.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.526
And if nobody answers
at all, you're screwed.

01:09:57.526 --> 01:09:59.694
You're screwed if
you make the call.

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.229
You're a fool
if you screw yourself.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.282
And when you get the person
you've called on the line,

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:06.234
if you tell them who you are,
you get two more points.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:09.655
And then if you tell them
that you love them,

01:10:09.655 --> 01:10:12.290
you get a bonus
of five more points.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.875
Hateful.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:17.880
Therefore, you can get as many
as ten points and as few as one.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.381
You can get
as few as none

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.632
if you know how
to work it.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.167
Hank, leave with me.

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:29.091
You don't understand,
Alan. I can't.

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:30.175
Well, if he doesn't
understand it,

01:10:30.175 --> 01:10:32.510
why don't you
explain it to him?

01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:33.595
I'll explain it
to him.

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:35.598
I had a feeling
you might.

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:38.100
Although I doubt that
it'll make any difference.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.601
That type refuses
to understand

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:41.937
that which they do not
wish to accept.

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:44.489
They reject
certain facts.

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:48.444
Alan...

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:50.946
Hank and Larry
are lovers.

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:54.950
Not just roommates,
bedmates.

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.701
Lovers.
Michael--

01:10:56.702 --> 01:10:59.788
No man has a roommate
after he's 30 years old.

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:02.090
If they're not lovers,
they're sisters.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.208
Hank's the one
who's over 30.

01:11:03.208 --> 01:11:05.093
You're pushing it.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:07.262
Hank?

01:11:09.715 --> 01:11:11.850
Yes, Alan. Larry is my lover.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:12.934
But you're married.

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:19.140
I think you said
the wrong thing.

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:21.726
Don't you just love
that quaint little idea?

01:11:21.727 --> 01:11:25.731
If a man is married, he's
automatically heterosexual.

01:11:25.731 --> 01:11:28.734
Alan, Hank swings
both ways...

01:11:28.734 --> 01:11:31.737
but with a decided
preference.

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.707
Well, now...

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.793
who's gonna make
the first call?

01:11:56.762 --> 01:11:57.763
Emory.

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:08.490
You go, Bernard.

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:11.493
I don't want to.

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:14.946
I don't want to either.
I don't want to at all.

01:12:14.947 --> 01:12:16.531
There are no accidents.

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:17.866
Then may I say,

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:18.950
that on your way home,

01:12:18.951 --> 01:12:21.036
I hope you will yourself
over an embankment.

01:12:22.121 --> 01:12:24.256
Go on. Call up
Peter Dahlbeck.

01:12:24.256 --> 01:12:26.041
That's who you'd like
to call, isn't it?

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:28.209
Who is Peter Dahlbeck?

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:30.795
Boy in Detroit whose family
Bernard's mother

01:12:30.796 --> 01:12:33.882
has been a laundress for
since he was a pickaninny.

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.884
I worked for them, too...

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.687
after school and every summer.

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:42.641
I think I've loved him
all my life.

01:12:44.643 --> 01:12:46.144
Hmm.

01:12:46.145 --> 01:12:48.147
But he never knew I was alive.

01:12:49.648 --> 01:12:51.733
Besides, he's straight.

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:54.820
Oh, so nothing ever
happened between you?

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.822
Oh, they finally
made it...

01:12:56.822 --> 01:12:58.323
in the pool house
one night

01:12:58.323 --> 01:13:01.042
after a drunken
swimming party.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.627
With the right wine
and the right music,

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.880
there are damn few
that aren't curious.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.966
And afterwards, we went
swimming in the nude.

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:08.967
How romantic.

01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:11.469
And the next morning you took
his coffee and Alka-Seltzer

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.472
up to him on a tray.

01:13:15.974 --> 01:13:17.475
It was in
the afternoon.

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:20.479
I remember that I was
worried sick all morning

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.981
about having to face him.

01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:24.983
He pretended like nothing
at all had happened.

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:26.484
Christ, he must have
been so drunk,

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:27.986
he didn't remember
a thing.

01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:31.990
Yeah. Heh.
I was sure relieved.

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:34.492
Odd how that works.

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:37.996
Now, for ten points,
get that liar on the phone.

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:06.808
You know
the number?

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:09.311
Sure. He's back in
Grosse Pointe, living at home.

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:13.315
He just got separated
from his third wife.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:23.041
D.A. or B.Y.?

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:26.627
He didn't even
give it time to find out.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.133
Come on, Bernard.
Pick up the phone and dial.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.884
You'll think
of something.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:33.886
You know you
want to call him.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.387
You know that,
don't you?

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:37.889
Well, go ahead.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.892
Your curiosity has
got the best of you now,

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:43.345
so go on. Call him.

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.903
Hateful.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:53.989
Oh, what's "D.A. or B.Y."?

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.911
Operator lingo for
"doesn't answer" or "busy."

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:05.283
Hello.
One point.

01:15:05.284 --> 01:15:06.835
Who's speaking?

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.839
Oh, Mrs. Dahlbeck,
um--

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.841
One point.

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:15.376
It's Bernard.
Francine's boy.

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.294
Son, not boy.

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:20.632
How are you?

01:15:20.632 --> 01:15:22.634
Good.

01:15:26.138 --> 01:15:27.639
Oh, just fine,
thank you.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.643
Um...Mrs. Dahlbeck,
is...

01:15:31.643 --> 01:15:32.644
Peter at home?

01:15:35.147 --> 01:15:37.149
Oh. Oh, I-- I see.

01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:38.150
Bullshit.

01:15:39.151 --> 01:15:40.902
No, no, it's
nothing important. I--

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:44.873
I just wanted to tell him
that I, um...

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.491
That I love him.
I've always loved him.

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.079
I just wanted to tell him
that I was sorry to hear

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:52.046
about him and his wife.

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:53.415
No points.

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:55.333
My-- My mother wrote me, yes.

01:15:55.334 --> 01:15:57.919
Yes, it is.
It really is.

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.424
Well...would you just
tell him that I called

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:04.426
and said I was very,
very sorry to hear,

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:05.927
and I hope they can
get it straightened out.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.431
Yes.

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:13.435
Yes.

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:16.938
Goodbye.

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.194
Two points total.
Terrible.

01:16:23.195 --> 01:16:25.280
Next?

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.782
Are you all right,
Bernard?

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:32.788
Why did I call?

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:37.759
Why did I do that?

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:41.296
Where
was he?

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:43.799
Out on a date.

01:16:51.523 --> 01:16:53.691
Come on, Emory.
Punch in.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:12.044
Can I have the number
in the Bronx

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.296
for a Delbert Botts,
please?

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:17.382
<i>A</i> Delbert Botts.
How many can there be?

01:17:17.382 --> 01:17:19.467
I wish I hadn't called now.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.336
No, the residence number, please.

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.061
Tha-- Thank you.

01:17:32.431 --> 01:17:35.484
I wish information would
stop calling me "ma'am."

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:38.486
By all means,

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.571
scribble all over
my telephone.

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:41.573
Comes off with a little spit.

01:17:41.573 --> 01:17:43.575
Like a lot of things.

01:17:43.575 --> 01:17:45.026
Who in the hell

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:47.195
is Delbert Botts?

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:50.615
He's the one person
I've always loved.

01:17:52.951 --> 01:17:54.953
That's who you said
to call, isn't it?

01:17:54.953 --> 01:17:56.955
That's right,
Emory Board.

01:17:56.955 --> 01:18:00.091
Look, how could you love anybody
with a name like that?

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:01.676
Yes, Emory. You couldn't
love anybody

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.045
with a name
like that.

01:18:03.962 --> 01:18:06.965
It wouldn't look good
on a place card.

01:18:06.965 --> 01:18:07.966
Isn't that right, Alan?

01:18:07.966 --> 01:18:10.518
I admit his name
is not so good,

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.103
but he's absolutely
beautiful.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.107
At least he was
when I was in school.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:18.610
Of course, I haven't
seen him since,

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:21.529
and he was about seven years
older than I, even then.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.615
Christ, you'd better call him
quick before he dies.

01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:28.153
I've loved him
ever since the first day

01:18:28.153 --> 01:18:29.654
I laid eyes on him...

01:18:29.654 --> 01:18:32.456
which was when
I was in the fifth grade

01:18:32.457 --> 01:18:33.541
and he was a senior.

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:36.544
And then he went away
to college,

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.046
and by the time
he got out,

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:40.832
I was in high school,
and he had become a dentist.

01:18:40.832 --> 01:18:42.300
A dentist?

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:45.886
Yes. Delbert Botts, D.D.S.

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:50.841
He opened his office
in a bank building.

01:18:50.842 --> 01:18:53.427
So you went and had every tooth
in your head pulled out, right?

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:01.236
No, I just had my teeth
cleaned, that's all.

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:04.322
I shouldn't have called.

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:05.406
Bernard, will you
shut up and go take

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.859
your boring, sleep-making icks
somewhere else?

01:19:20.872 --> 01:19:22.874
I remember I looked
right into his eyes

01:19:22.874 --> 01:19:24.375
the whole time.

01:19:24.376 --> 01:19:26.378
Kept wanting to bite
his fingers.

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:31.883
Well, it's absolutely
mind-boggling.

01:19:31.883 --> 01:19:33.384
Phyllis
Phallic.

01:19:33.385 --> 01:19:36.388
It absolutely
boggles the mind.

01:19:36.388 --> 01:19:37.222
Alan.

01:19:38.557 --> 01:19:39.558
Thank you,
Donald.

01:19:40.559 --> 01:19:42.561
Sara Samaritan.

01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:45.030
I told him I was having my teeth cleaned

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.114
for the junior-senior
prom,

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:48.616
for which I was in charge
of decorations.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.621
I told him it was
a celestial theme,

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.623
and I was cutting stars
out of tinfoil,

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.625
and making clouds
from angel's hair

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:57.626
and chicken wire.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:05.083
Mary, it takes a fairy
to make something pretty.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:12.340
He was engaged to this
stupid-ass girl named Loraine,

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.842
whose mother was
truly Supercunt.

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:15.844
Don't
digress.

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.431
Anyway,
I was a wreck.

01:20:20.432 --> 01:20:23.351
I mean, I was
a total mess.

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:25.936
Finally, I called him
on the telephone

01:20:25.937 --> 01:20:28.439
and asked him if I could
see him alone.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.443
Clearly not
the coolest of moves.

01:20:31.443 --> 01:20:34.946
He said okay and told me
to come by his house.

01:20:36.448 --> 01:20:39.451
I was so nervous this time,
my voice was shaking

01:20:39.451 --> 01:20:42.454
and my hands
were unsteady.

01:20:42.454 --> 01:20:43.955
I couldn't even
look at him.

01:20:43.955 --> 01:20:45.456
I just stared straight
ahead in space

01:20:45.457 --> 01:20:47.375
and blurted out
why I'd come.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:53.098
And I asked him to be my friend.

01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:56.016
Poor bastard.
Shh!

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.520
He said he'd be glad
to be my friend.

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:03.024
And any time I wanted to
see him or call him

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:05.026
to just call him
and he'd see me.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:10.532
Shook my trembling wet hand,
and I left on a cloud.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.034
One of the ones
you made yourself?

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:15.036
And the next day I went out
and bought him

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.821
a gold-plated
cigarette lighter,

01:21:16.821 --> 01:21:19.907
and had his initials
monogrammed on it.

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:21.910
And I wrote him
a card that said,

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.628
"From your
friend, Emory."

01:21:23.628 --> 01:21:25.713
Seventeen years old

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.632
and already big
with the gifts.

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.553
And the night of the prom
I found out.

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.388
Found out
what?

01:21:38.677 --> 01:21:42.180
I heard Loraine and another girl
I knew giggling together.

01:21:44.683 --> 01:21:47.185
Pretty soon everyone at
the dance had heard about it.

01:21:47.185 --> 01:21:49.187
They were all laughing
and making jokes.

01:21:52.190 --> 01:21:55.193
Everyone knew I had a crush
on Dr. Delbert Botts

01:21:55.193 --> 01:21:57.195
and that I asked him
to be my friend.

01:22:03.201 --> 01:22:06.204
And what they didn't know
was that I loved him.

01:22:08.206 --> 01:22:10.708
And that I'd go on
loving him years after

01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:12.711
they had all forgotten
my funny secret.

01:22:19.718 --> 01:22:23.354
Well, I for one, need
an insulin injection.

01:22:25.557 --> 01:22:27.392
Call him.
Don't, Emory.

01:22:27.392 --> 01:22:29.227
Since when are you
telling him what to do?

01:22:29.227 --> 01:22:32.313
What do I care? I'm pissed.
I'll do anything three times.

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:34.366
Don't, please.
I said call him.

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:36.067
Don't. You'll be sorry.
Take my word for it.

01:22:36.067 --> 01:22:37.785
What have I got to lose?

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.621
Your dignity. That's
what you've got to lose.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.739
Well, that's a knee-slapper.

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.324
I love your telling him
about dignity,

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:45.827
when you allow him
to degrade you constantly

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:48.079
by Uncle Tomming
you to death.

01:22:48.079 --> 01:22:50.631
He can do it, Michael.

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.550
I can do it.
You can't do it.

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.885
Isn't that discrimination?
I don't like it from him.

01:22:54.886 --> 01:22:55.970
I don't like it
from me.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.806
I do it to myself,
and I let him do it.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.675
I let him do it because
it's the only thing that,

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:01.976
to him, makes him
my equal.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.561
You all want to hear

01:23:03.561 --> 01:23:07.014
a polite little parlor jest
from the liberal Deep South?

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:10.101
You know why nigras
have such big lips?

01:23:10.101 --> 01:23:12.570
'Cause they're always going:

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.823
You son of a bitch!
Jesus Christ, Michael!

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.275
Michael, why don't you lay off.

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.110
And I can do without
your goddamn spit

01:23:20.111 --> 01:23:21.112
all over my telephone,

01:23:21.112 --> 01:23:23.114
you nelly coward.

01:23:23.114 --> 01:23:25.616
I may be nelly, Michael,
but I'm no coward.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.602
B.Y.
Mm, it's busy?

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:48.389
Loraine is probably
speaking to her mother.

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:52.360
Oh, yes. Delbert
married Loraine.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.445
Well, I'm sorry.
We can't wait.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:55.864
You forfeit
your turn.

01:24:04.155 --> 01:24:06.657
Well, you're not
wasting any time.

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:09.077
Who are you
calling?

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.832
Charlie.
I refuse to forfeit my turn.

01:24:14.833 --> 01:24:17.302
It's my turn
and I'm taking it.

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:18.386
That's the spirit, Emory.

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:20.504
Hit that iceberg.
Don't miss it!

01:24:20.505 --> 01:24:22.089
Hit it, goddamn it!

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.975
I want a smash of a finale!

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:26.594
God, I'm drunk.

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:29.179
A falling-down drunk
nelly queen.

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:32.516
Well, that's the pot
calling the kettle beige.

01:24:32.517 --> 01:24:33.601
I am not drunk!

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.405
You cannot tell that I am drunk.

01:24:40.358 --> 01:24:41.826
Donald, I'm not drunk, am I?

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.745
I'm drunk.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.615
So am I. I'm
a major drunk.

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:49.700
Shut up
and dial.

01:24:51.703 --> 01:24:54.706
I'm a major drunk of
this or any other season.

01:24:59.210 --> 01:25:01.212
It's ringing.

01:25:01.212 --> 01:25:04.215
It's no longer B.Y.

01:25:06.718 --> 01:25:08.720
Hello, who's speaking?

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.722
One point.
Who?

01:25:12.724 --> 01:25:14.525
Dr. Delbert Botts.

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:15.610
Two points.

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.614
Del, is this
really you?

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.652
Nobody.

01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:28.155
You don't know me.

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.659
You wouldn't remember me.

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:35.663
I'm just a friend.

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:40.468
Falling-down drunken friend.

01:25:43.755 --> 01:25:44.756
Hello?

01:25:51.763 --> 01:25:52.647
He hung up.

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:56.234
Three points total.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:57.735
You're winning.

01:25:58.736 --> 01:26:01.739
He said I must have
the wrong party.

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:03.490
He's right.

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:05.493
We have the wrong party.

01:26:09.113 --> 01:26:10.614
It's your party, Hallie.

01:26:12.116 --> 01:26:14.001
Aren't you having
a good time?

01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:17.872
Simply fabulous.

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:19.874
What about you?

01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:21.375
You having
a good time, Emory?

01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:25.012
Are you having as good a time
as you thought you would?

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.547
If you're bored, Harold,

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:29.050
we could sing
"Happy Birthday" again

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:30.017
to the tune of
"Hava Nagila."

01:26:34.973 --> 01:26:38.276
Not for all the tea
in Mexico.

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:39.860
My turn now.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:40.862
No, it's my turn
to call Charlie.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:41.863
Nope. Let me.

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.365
You gonna call
Charlie?

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.367
The score
is three to two.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.369
Emory's favor.
Don't, Hank.

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:50.371
Don't you see
Bernard was right?

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:51.372
I want to.

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.377
Larry.

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.385
Be my eager guest.

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:08.889
Is he gonna call
Charlie for you?

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.475
Charlie is all the people
I cheat on Hank with.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:12.977
"With whom"
I cheat on Hank.

01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:14.845
The butcher,
the baker,

01:27:14.846 --> 01:27:16.430
the candlestick maker.
Right.

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:17.432
I love 'em all.

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:20.935
And what Hank refuses
to understand

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:23.437
is that I've got to
have them all.

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:25.857
I'm not the marrying kind,
and I never will be.

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:28.776
Gypsy feet.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:32.747
Who you calling?
Did it ever occur to you

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.331
that Hank might be
doing behind your back

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:35.916
the same thing
that you do behind his?

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.002
Oh, I wish to Christ
he would.

01:27:38.002 --> 01:27:41.005
It would make life
a hell of a lot easier.

01:27:41.005 --> 01:27:42.673
Who are you calling?

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:44.625
Whoever it is,
they're not

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.628
sitting on top of
the telephone.

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:49.547
Hello.
Oh, uh, they must have been in the tub.

01:27:49.547 --> 01:27:51.765
Eighty-six. One point.

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.217
I'd like to leave
a message please.

01:27:53.217 --> 01:27:54.268
Not in?

01:27:55.219 --> 01:27:56.720
One point.

01:27:56.721 --> 01:27:57.722
Would you say that Hank called?

01:27:58.723 --> 01:27:59.724
Yes, it is.

01:28:00.725 --> 01:28:02.226
Oh. Good evening.

01:28:02.226 --> 01:28:03.227
How are you?

01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:04.978
Oh, who the hell is that?

01:28:06.864 --> 01:28:09.199
Yes, that's right. The message
is for my roommate, Larry.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.452
Would you just...say
that I called?

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:12.953
It's our answering service.

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:15.623
Said, "I love you."

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:16.540
Hank, are you crazy?

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:17.875
You didn't hear me
incorrectly,

01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:19.376
that's what
I said.

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:20.878
The message is for Larry,
and it's from me, Hank,

01:28:20.878 --> 01:28:22.379
and it's just
as I said, "I love you."

01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:25.465
Thank you.

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:27.050
Seven points total.

01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:28.552
You're way ahead,
Hank, baby.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:30.922
You're way ahead
of everybody.

01:28:30.922 --> 01:28:33.341
Why, Hank?
Why did you do that?

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:34.342
I do love him.

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:37.928
And I don't care
who knows it.

01:28:37.929 --> 01:28:39.013
Don't say that.

01:28:43.101 --> 01:28:44.102
Why not?

01:28:45.103 --> 01:28:46.104
It's the truth.

01:28:46.104 --> 01:28:47.605
I can't believe you.

01:28:50.608 --> 01:28:53.661
I left my wife and family
for Larry, Alan.

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:55.746
I'm really not very interested
in hearing about it.

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:57.749
Sure you are.

01:28:57.749 --> 01:28:59.751
Go on, Hankola,
tell him all about it.

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:01.753
No, I don't want to
hear it. It's disgusting.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.588
Some men do it
for another woman.

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:05.122
Well, I can understand
that. That's normal.

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:10.094
Well, it just
doesn't always

01:29:10.094 --> 01:29:11.595
work out
that way, Alan.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.600
No matter how much
we might want it to.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.101
God knows, nobody
ever wanted it to

01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:18.051
more than
I did.

01:29:20.104 --> 01:29:21.605
I mean, I really
and truly believed

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:23.608
I was in love with my wife
when I married her.

01:29:23.608 --> 01:29:25.109
It wasn't
entirely my trying

01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:26.610
to prove something
to myself.

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:29.614
No, I didn't...

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:33.117
love her. She
loved me. But, uh...

01:29:34.118 --> 01:29:35.903
there was always
that something there.

01:29:36.654 --> 01:29:37.655
Always?

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:40.625
I don't know.

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:42.576
I suppose so.

01:29:42.577 --> 01:29:45.046
I've known what I was
since I was 4 years old.

01:29:46.964 --> 01:29:48.465
I don't know when it was

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:50.968
that I first started
admitting it to myself.

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:55.473
For a long time, I either...

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:58.976
labeled it something else or...

01:29:58.976 --> 01:30:00.978
denied it completely.

01:30:00.978 --> 01:30:03.981
Christ, was I drunk last night.

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:07.485
But there did
come a time

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:09.987
when I just couldn't
lie to myself anymore.

01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:15.493
I thought about it.

01:30:15.493 --> 01:30:17.495
But I never did
anything about it.

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:20.498
I think...

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.000
the first time I ever really
did anything about it

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.003
was...during my wife's
last pregnancy.

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:30.507
There was a, uh...

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:32.593
teacher's meeting
here in New York.

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.177
My wife didn't
feel up to the trip,

01:30:34.178 --> 01:30:36.680
so I said I would
come alone.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:39.467
That day on the train,
I started to think about it.

01:30:41.219 --> 01:30:43.221
And think about it, and...

01:30:43.221 --> 01:30:44.722
think about it.

01:30:44.722 --> 01:30:47.224
The whole trip I didn't
think about anything else.

01:30:50.728 --> 01:30:52.229
Within 15 minutes
after I had arrived,

01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:54.732
I'd picked up a guy
in the men's room

01:30:54.732 --> 01:30:56.150
of Grand Central Station.

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:57.201
Jesus.

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:01.655
I'd never done anything
like that in my life before.

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:04.158
I was scared
to death.

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.160
But he turned out
to be a nice fellow.

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:10.130
I haven't seen him since,
of course.

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:13.668
And the funny
thing is...

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:16.303
I can't remember
his name anymore.

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:21.892
Anyway, after that,
it got easier.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:24.312
Practice
makes perfect.

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:28.682
And then, not
too long after that,

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.685
Larry and I
met at a party

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:33.688
that my wife and I
had come into town for.

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:37.191
Then your real troubles began.

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:38.692
You know that was--

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.828
Was nearly
two years ago.

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:45.699
Why am I always the goddamn
villain in the piece.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:50.004
If I'm not thought of
as a happy-home wrecker,

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:53.507
I'm an impossible
son of a bitch to live with.

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:55.626
Guilt turns
to hostility.

01:31:55.626 --> 01:31:57.628
Isn't that right,
Michael?

01:31:57.628 --> 01:31:59.963
Go stick your tweezers
in your cheek.

01:31:59.964 --> 01:32:01.548
I'm fed up to my teeth
with everybody

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:05.052
feeling so goddamn sorry
for poor shat-upon Hank.

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:08.055
Oh, Larry. Everybody knows
you're Freda Fickle.

01:32:08.055 --> 01:32:09.890
Look.

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:12.977
I've never made any promises,
and I don't intend to.

01:32:12.977 --> 01:32:14.979
It's my right to lead
my sex life

01:32:14.979 --> 01:32:16.981
without answering to anybody.

01:32:16.981 --> 01:32:18.482
Hank included.

01:32:18.482 --> 01:32:20.700
And if those terms
are not acceptable,

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:22.202
then we must not
live together.

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:26.573
Numerous relations is
a part of the way I am.

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:28.959
You don't have to be gay
to be wanton.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.046
By "the way I am,"
I don't mean "being gay."

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:34.548
I mean my sexual appetite.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:37.552
And I don't think of
myself as a wanton.

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:41.805
Oh, Emory, you're the most
promiscuous person I know.

01:32:43.307 --> 01:32:44.808
I'm not promiscuous
at all.

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:46.760
Not by choice.

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:48.312
By design.

01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:52.316
Who would want to go to bed with
a flaming little sissy like you?

01:32:52.316 --> 01:32:53.317
Michael.

01:32:53.317 --> 01:32:54.818
Who'd make
a pass at you?

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.854
I'll tell you who,
nobody.

01:32:56.854 --> 01:33:00.440
Except some fugitive
from the Braille Institute.

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:02.075
Why do you let him
talk to you that way?

01:33:02.076 --> 01:33:04.445
"Physical beauty
isn't everything."

01:33:04.445 --> 01:33:05.996
Thank you, Quasimodo.

01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:08.833
Do you know what it's like
living with the goddamn gestapo?

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:12.286
I can't breathe without
getting the third degree.

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:13.620
Larry, it's your turn to call.

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:14.922
You know, I can't
take all this

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:17.925
let's-be-faithful-and-never-
look-at-another-person routine,

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:19.509
because it just doesn't work.

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:21.094
If you want to
promise that, fine.

01:33:21.095 --> 01:33:23.130
Then you do it
and you stick to it.

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.715
But if you have to promise it,
as far as I'm concerned,

01:33:25.716 --> 01:33:27.968
nothing finishes
a relationship faster.

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:31.889
Give me Librium
or give me meth.

01:33:31.889 --> 01:33:34.858
Yeah, freedom, baby.
Freedom.

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:35.943
You gotta have it.

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:38.395
It-- It just doesn't
work any other way.

01:33:38.396 --> 01:33:41.949
Oh, and the ones who swear their
undying fidelity are lying.

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.536
90 percent of them anyway.

01:33:45.536 --> 01:33:47.120
They cheat on
each other constantly

01:33:47.121 --> 01:33:48.622
and lie through
their teeth.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:50.124
Well, I'm sorry,
I can't be like that,

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:52.126
and it drives Hank
up the wall.

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:54.128
Yeah, well, there is
that 10 percent, Larry.

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:55.629
Well, the only way
that stands a chance

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:57.632
is with some sort of
an understanding.

01:33:57.632 --> 01:33:59.634
Yeah, well, I've tried
to go along with that.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.469
Oh, come on.
I agreed to an agreement.

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.303
Your agreement.

01:34:03.587 --> 01:34:04.387
What agreement?

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.058
A ménage.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:10.928
Oh, now, look, I know a lot of
people think that's the answer.

01:34:10.928 --> 01:34:12.429
They don't consider
that cheating.

01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:13.681
But it's not my style.

01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:14.982
Well, I certainly
never wanted it.

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:16.483
Well, then
who suggested it?

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:17.485
Well, it was
a compromise.

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:19.270
Exactly.
And you agreed!

01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:20.854
I didn't agree to anything.

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:24.775
You agreed to your own proposal
and informed me that I agreed.

01:34:27.578 --> 01:34:29.663
Uh, I don't
understand.

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:30.498
What's a me--

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.082
A ménage à
trois, baby.

01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:35.586
Two's company,
three's a ménage.

01:34:35.586 --> 01:34:38.088
Well, it...

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:39.590
works for some.

01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:42.042
Well, I'm not one
for group therapy.

01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:45.096
I can't relate to anything
or anyone that way.

01:34:45.096 --> 01:34:47.098
I'm old-fashioned.
I like 'em all,

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:48.966
but I like 'em
one at  .

01:34:48.966 --> 01:34:52.052
And did you like Donald
as a single side attraction?

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:02.446
Yes, I did.

01:35:04.482 --> 01:35:06.066
So did I, Larry.

01:35:07.485 --> 01:35:09.153
Did you tell him?

01:35:09.153 --> 01:35:10.237
No.

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:14.241
It was obvious from the moment
you walked in the door.

01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:16.243
What was this song and dance
about never having met

01:35:16.243 --> 01:35:17.744
but having seen
each other?

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.747
It was true.

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.915
We saw each other at the baths
and went to bed together,

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:25.169
but we never spoke
a word, and we--

01:35:25.169 --> 01:35:27.337
We never knew
each other's names.

01:35:27.338 --> 01:35:29.423
You had better luck
than I do.

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:30.924
If I don't
get arrested,

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:32.927
my trick announces
on departure

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:34.929
that he's been
exposed to hepatitis.

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:38.399
What kind of an understanding
do you want?

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:43.404
Respect for
one another's freedom.

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:46.190
With no need to lie or pretend.

01:35:47.491 --> 01:35:50.193
Hank, in my own way,
I love you.

01:35:50.194 --> 01:35:53.197
But you've got to understand
that even though I do want to

01:35:53.197 --> 01:35:55.949
go on living with you, that
sometimes there may be others.

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.035
Now, I don't want to
flaunt it in your face,

01:35:58.035 --> 01:35:59.036
and I know if
it ever happens,

01:35:59.036 --> 01:36:00.954
I'll never
mention it to you.

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:03.040
But if you ask me,
I'll tell you.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.342
He gets points.

01:36:05.342 --> 01:36:06.343
What?

01:36:06.343 --> 01:36:08.345
He said it.

01:36:08.345 --> 01:36:09.846
He said I love you to Hank,
he gets the bonus.

01:36:09.847 --> 01:36:11.348
He didn't
call him.

01:36:11.348 --> 01:36:13.883
Uh, he called him. He just
didn't use the telephone.

01:36:13.884 --> 01:36:15.685
Then he doesn't get any points.

01:36:15.686 --> 01:36:17.354
He gets five points.

01:36:17.354 --> 01:36:18.438
He didn't use
the goddamn telephone!

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:20.224
He doesn't get a goddamn thing.

01:36:41.712 --> 01:36:44.081
Hank.
It's for you.

01:36:57.928 --> 01:36:59.095
Hello.

01:36:59.096 --> 01:37:00.097
One point.

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.182
Hello, Hank.

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.267
Two points.

01:37:03.267 --> 01:37:04.268
This is
Larry.

01:37:04.268 --> 01:37:05.686
Two more points.

01:37:07.605 --> 01:37:09.607
For what it's worth...

01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:13.611
I love you.

01:37:15.112 --> 01:37:16.947
Five points bonus.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.784
I'll try.

01:37:23.287 --> 01:37:24.288
I will too.

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:32.346
Larry's the winner.

01:37:45.442 --> 01:37:48.528
Well, that wasn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:52.032
The game isn't over yet.

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:55.736
Your turn,
Alan.

01:37:55.736 --> 01:37:57.821
Pick up the telephone,
buster.

01:37:57.821 --> 01:37:58.822
Michael, don't.

01:37:58.822 --> 01:38:00.824
You keep out of this.

01:38:00.824 --> 01:38:03.326
You don't
have to, Alan.

01:38:03.327 --> 01:38:04.494
You don't have to.

01:38:04.495 --> 01:38:06.997
Emory, I'm sorry
for what I did before.

01:38:06.997 --> 01:38:08.081
Oh, forget it.

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:10.084
Forgive us
our trespasses.

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:13.587
Christ, now you're both
joined at the goddamn hip.

01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:15.589
You can decorate his house
for him, Emory,

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:18.091
and he can get you out of jail
the next time you're arrested

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:19.593
on a morals charge.

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:22.562
Who are you gonna
call, Alan?

01:38:24.481 --> 01:38:26.232
Can't remember anyone?

01:38:27.518 --> 01:38:29.603
Well, maybe you need
a minute to think.

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:31.688
Is that it?

01:38:33.657 --> 01:38:36.242
I believe this will be
the final round.

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:42.999
Aren't you gonna
call anyone, Michael?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.501
How could he?

01:38:44.501 --> 01:38:45.919
He's never loved
anyone.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:50.757
♪ No matter how you figure
It's tough to be a nigger ♪

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:53.510
♪ But it's tougher
To be a Jew ♪

01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:55.678
My God, Michael.

01:38:55.679 --> 01:38:57.681
You're a charming host.

01:38:57.681 --> 01:38:59.549
Michael doesn't have charm, Donald.

01:38:59.550 --> 01:39:03.470
Michael has
counter-charm.

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.807
You going somewhere?

01:39:07.808 --> 01:39:09.309
Yes, you're gonna
have to excuse me.

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:12.362
You're gonna miss
the end of the game.

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:14.198
You'll have to tell me
how it comes out.

01:39:14.198 --> 01:39:15.782
I never reveal an ending.

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:18.735
And no one will be reseated
during the climactic revelation.

01:39:44.928 --> 01:39:46.930
What do you suppose
is going on up there?

01:39:46.930 --> 01:39:48.431
Hm, Alan?

01:39:49.933 --> 01:39:53.770
What do you imagine Hank and
Larry are doing up there? Hm?

01:39:53.771 --> 01:39:56.356
Whatever they're doing,
they're not hurting anyone.

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:58.575
And they're minding
their own business.

01:39:58.575 --> 01:40:00.159
And you mind
yours, Harold!

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.444
I'm warning you.

01:40:02.246 --> 01:40:04.748
Are you now?

01:40:04.748 --> 01:40:06.249
You warning me?

01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:07.751
Me?

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:12.205
I'm Harold.

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:14.708
I'm the one person
you don't warn, Michael.

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:17.210
Because you and I
are a match.

01:40:17.211 --> 01:40:19.213
And we tread very softly
with each other

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:22.716
because we both play
each other's game too well.

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:25.218
I know this game
you're playing.

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:29.223
I know it very well,
and I play it very well.

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:31.225
You play it very well too,
but you know what?

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:35.312
I'm the only one who's
better at it than you are.

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:39.733
I can beat you at it,
so don't push me.

01:40:40.734 --> 01:40:43.570
I'm warning <i>you.</i>

01:40:47.958 --> 01:40:49.326
You're funny, Hallie.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:53.630
A laugh riot.

01:40:53.630 --> 01:40:55.164
Isn't he funny, Alan?

01:40:56.166 --> 01:40:58.668
Or as you might say,
"Isn't he amusing?"

01:40:58.669 --> 01:41:00.504
He's an amusing
faggot, isn't he?

01:41:01.972 --> 01:41:03.556
Or as you might say,
"freak."

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:06.677
That's what you called
Emory, wasn't it?

01:41:06.677 --> 01:41:08.261
A "freak"?

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:09.763
A "pansy."

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:13.099
My, what an antiquated
vocabulary you have.

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.602
I'm surprised
you didn't say "sodomite."

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:17.186
Or "pederast."

01:41:17.187 --> 01:41:20.190
You better let me
bring you up to date.

01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:23.159
Now, this isn't so new,
but it might be new to you.

01:41:24.194 --> 01:41:27.197
Have you heard the term,
"closet queen"?

01:41:27.197 --> 01:41:29.199
You know what
that means?

01:41:29.199 --> 01:41:31.584
Do you know what it means
to be in the closet?

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:34.955
Don't, Michael. It won't help
to explain what it means.

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:36.539
He already knows
what it means.

01:41:38.041 --> 01:41:41.094
He knows very, very well
what a closet queen is.

01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:42.179
Don't you, Alan?
Michael,

01:41:42.179 --> 01:41:44.681
if you're insinuating
that I'm homosexual,

01:41:44.681 --> 01:41:46.132
I can only say
that you're mistaken.

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:48.218
Am I?

01:41:48.218 --> 01:41:49.686
What about Justin Stuart?

01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:52.605
What about
Justin Stuart?

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:54.691
You were in love with him.
That's what about him.

01:41:54.691 --> 01:41:56.275
And that's who
you're gonna call.

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:58.861
Justin and I were
very good friends.

01:41:58.862 --> 01:41:59.646
That's all.

01:42:00.731 --> 01:42:01.732
According to Justin,

01:42:01.732 --> 01:42:03.150
the friendship was
quite passionate.

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:04.651
What do you mean?
I mean that you slept

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:05.652
with him in college...

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:06.736
several times.

01:42:06.737 --> 01:42:09.156
That's not true.
Several times.

01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:10.707
Once is youth.

01:42:10.707 --> 01:42:12.792
Twice, a phase
maybe.

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:14.461
Several times,
you like it.

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:16.379
That's not true.
It is true!

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.665
Because Justin Stuart
is homosexual.

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:20.583
He comes to
New York occasionally.

01:42:20.584 --> 01:42:22.669
He calls me. I've
taken him to parties.

01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:23.586
Larry's had him once.

01:42:23.587 --> 01:42:25.171
I've slept with Justin!

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:27.057
And he's told me
all about you!

01:42:27.057 --> 01:42:29.726
Then he told you a lie.
You were obsessed with Justin.

01:42:29.726 --> 01:42:31.728
That's all
you could talk about,

01:42:31.728 --> 01:42:33.396
morning, noon and night.

01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:36.433
You began it tonight
upstairs about Hank,

01:42:36.433 --> 01:42:38.017
what an attractive
fellow he was,

01:42:38.018 --> 01:42:40.520
and all the rest of
that transparent crap.

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:42.322
I said he was attractive.
That's all.

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:44.907
How many times
do you have to say it?

01:42:44.908 --> 01:42:48.411
And how many times did you
have to say it about Justin?

01:42:48.412 --> 01:42:50.414
What a good
tennis player he was,

01:42:50.414 --> 01:42:53.333
what a good dancer he was,
what a good body he had.

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.785
How amusing he was,
how bright he was.

01:42:55.786 --> 01:42:57.370
How the girls were
all mad about him.

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:59.373
What close
friends you were!

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:03.093
We were. We were very good,
very close friends. That's all.

01:43:03.093 --> 01:43:04.260
It was obvious!

01:43:04.261 --> 01:43:05.345
When you did it
in front of Fran,

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:06.846
it was downright
embarrassing.

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.715
Even she must have
had her doubts about you.

01:43:10.050 --> 01:43:12.052
Justin lied.

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:13.553
If he told you that,
he lied.

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:15.556
And it is a lie.
A vicious lie.

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:19.025
He'd say anything
about me now to get even,

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.528
because he could never get over
the fact that I dropped him.

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:24.447
But I had to.

01:43:25.899 --> 01:43:28.401
I had to because he told me
all about himself.

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:30.904
He told me that he--

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.874
He told me that he wanted me
to be his lover.

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:39.880
And I told him
that he made me sick.

01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:44.384
I told him that I pitied him.

01:43:46.670 --> 01:43:48.304
You ended the friendship,
Alan,

01:43:48.305 --> 01:43:50.890
because you couldn't face
the truth about yourself.

01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:53.393
Oh, you could go on
sleeping with Justin...

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:54.394
as long as he lied
to himself,

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:55.895
and you lied
to yourself.

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:58.899
And you both dated girls
and labeled yourselves men,

01:43:58.899 --> 01:44:01.401
and called yourselves
just fond friends.

01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:03.903
But Justin finally
had to be honest!

01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:05.906
And you couldn't
take it.

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:08.909
You-- You couldn't take it,
and so you destroyed

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:09.910
the friendship...

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.412
and your friend
along with it.

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:13.413
Justin could never
understand

01:44:13.413 --> 01:44:15.915
what he had done wrong
to make you drop him.

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:17.417
He blamed himself.
No.

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:18.918
He did that, yes,
until he discovered

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:21.204
who he was
and what he was.

01:44:21.204 --> 01:44:22.672
No.
But to this day

01:44:22.673 --> 01:44:24.207
he remembers the treatment,

01:44:24.207 --> 01:44:26.509
the scars he got from you.

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:27.761
No!
Pick up this phone

01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:29.095
and call Justin.

01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:30.597
Call him and apologize,

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:32.682
and tell him what you should've
told him 12 years ago.

01:44:32.683 --> 01:44:34.301
Call him.

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:35.302
No, Michael.

01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:37.354
He lied.
Not a word is true.

01:44:37.354 --> 01:44:37.937
Call him!

01:44:45.395 --> 01:44:46.896
Very well.

01:44:47.898 --> 01:44:49.366
I'll dial.

01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:52.569
You're so helpful.

01:44:58.075 --> 01:44:59.459
Give it to me.

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:53.546
Hello.
One point.

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:56.967
It's Alan.
Two points.

01:45:56.967 --> 01:45:58.551
Yes.

01:45:58.552 --> 01:46:00.720
Yes, it's me.
Is that Justin?

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:02.439
You sound surprised.
I should hope to think

01:46:02.439 --> 01:46:04.107
he would be after 12 years.

01:46:04.107 --> 01:46:06.192
No, I'm-- I'm
in New York.

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:09.196
I, uh--
I won't explain now.

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:11.698
I-I-- I just called
to tell you that--

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.568
I just called to
tell you that I'm here--

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:17.821
"That I love you," goddamn it!

01:46:17.821 --> 01:46:18.738
I love you!

01:46:24.828 --> 01:46:26.162
And I love you.

01:46:28.999 --> 01:46:32.002
You get the goddamn bonus.

01:46:32.002 --> 01:46:33.470
Ten points, jackpot.

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:37.173
I love you and I beg you
to forgive me.

01:46:37.174 --> 01:46:38.341
Give me that telephone.

01:46:39.426 --> 01:46:41.428
Justin, did you hear
what that son of--?

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.933
F-Fran?

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:51.438
W-- Well, of course
I knew it was you.

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:53.940
How are you doing?

01:46:56.827 --> 01:46:57.828
Uh, fine.

01:47:01.281 --> 01:47:03.366
Uh...yes, me too.

01:47:03.366 --> 01:47:04.950
Fine.

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:09.205
Um, uh, yes.

01:47:09.206 --> 01:47:12.209
He told me all about it.

01:47:16.213 --> 01:47:18.715
No, don't thank me,
please. Uh--

01:47:20.217 --> 01:47:23.220
Uh, look, I'll-- I'll put him
back on the line.

01:47:25.722 --> 01:47:27.724
Give my love to the kids.

01:47:40.036 --> 01:47:41.037
Darling.

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.991
I'll catch the first
plane I can get.

01:47:48.462 --> 01:47:49.412
Yes.

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:53.800
I love you very much.

01:47:57.304 --> 01:47:58.805
Yes.

01:48:13.403 --> 01:48:14.904
Thank you, Michael.

01:48:34.374 --> 01:48:35.291
Who won?

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.761
It was a tie.

01:48:39.212 --> 01:48:42.298
Now, it's my turn.

01:48:42.299 --> 01:48:45.385
And ready or not,
Michael, here goes.

01:48:45.385 --> 01:48:47.687
You're a sad
and pathetic man.

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:53.526
You're a homosexual,
and you don't want to be.

01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:56.112
But there's nothing
you can do to change it.

01:48:57.614 --> 01:49:01.117
Not all your prayers
to your God...

01:49:01.117 --> 01:49:03.119
not all the analysis
you can buy

01:49:03.119 --> 01:49:05.621
in all the years
you've got left to live.

01:49:07.624 --> 01:49:09.125
You may very well
one day be able to know

01:49:09.125 --> 01:49:12.128
a heterosexual life...

01:49:12.128 --> 01:49:15.131
if you want it
desperately enough.

01:49:15.131 --> 01:49:18.634
If you pursue it with the fervor
with which you annihilate.

01:49:20.136 --> 01:49:22.588
But you'll always be
homosexual as well.

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:25.558
Always, Michael.

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.061
Always.

01:49:29.062 --> 01:49:31.564
Until the day you die.

01:49:40.357 --> 01:49:41.408
Friends.

01:49:41.408 --> 01:49:43.493
Oh.

01:49:43.493 --> 01:49:46.913
Thanks for
the nifty party...

01:49:46.913 --> 01:49:49.865
and the super gift.

01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:53.202
It's just what I needed.

01:49:54.204 --> 01:49:57.006
Bernard,...thank you.

01:49:58.341 --> 01:50:00.843
Will you
get him home?

01:50:00.844 --> 01:50:04.347
Don't worry about her. I'll
take care of everything.

01:50:09.019 --> 01:50:10.353
Donald, good to see you.

01:50:11.688 --> 01:50:13.940
Good night, Harold.
See you again sometime.

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.525
Yeah. How about
a year from Shevouth?

01:50:18.028 --> 01:50:20.030
Come on, Tex.

01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:21.314
Let's go to my place.

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.331
Oh, Michael...

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:40.132
thanks for the laughs.

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:45.388
Call you tomorrow.

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:54.347
Thank you, Michael.

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:55.648
Good night,
Donald.

01:50:55.649 --> 01:50:56.733
Goodbye, Emory.

01:50:58.184 --> 01:50:59.735
Come on, Bernard.

01:50:59.736 --> 01:51:01.237
Time to go home.

01:51:05.742 --> 01:51:08.745
Oh, Mary. You're
a heavy mother.

01:51:08.745 --> 01:51:10.747
Why did I call?
Why'd I--?

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:22.042
Donald?

01:51:24.127 --> 01:51:26.462
Donald. Donald!

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:32.052
What have I done?

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:37.057
My God.
What have I d--?

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.058
Michael. Michael.

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:41.061
It's beginning.

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:43.063
The anxiety.

01:51:43.063 --> 01:51:43.897
I feel it.

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:48.201
Donald. Don't leave.

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:50.736
Please, don't leave me.

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:53.789
Oh, Jesus.

01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:55.291
I can't handle it.

01:51:55.291 --> 01:51:56.792
I won't make it.

01:51:56.793 --> 01:51:57.794
I won't make it!
Michael--

01:51:57.794 --> 01:52:00.630
I won't make it!
Michael, stop it.

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:02.214
Stop it.

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:03.716
Look, I'll-- I'll
give you a Valium.

01:52:03.717 --> 01:52:07.220
I've got some in my pocket.
No. No. No.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:08.721
Pills and alcohol,
I'll die.

01:52:08.722 --> 01:52:11.224
I'm not gonna give you
the whole bottle.

01:52:11.224 --> 01:52:12.725
Come on, let go of me.
No.

01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:15.729
Let go of me long enough for me
to get my hand in my pocket.

01:52:17.731 --> 01:52:20.233
No. Don't leave.

01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:21.734
Come on.

01:52:23.236 --> 01:52:24.237
Come on.

01:52:25.238 --> 01:52:27.607
I d-- I don't have any water

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:29.692
to take it with.

01:52:29.692 --> 01:52:31.193
Well, if you'll wait
one goddamn minute,

01:52:31.194 --> 01:52:32.111
I'll get you some.

01:52:36.783 --> 01:52:39.368
Uh, your water,
Your Majesty.

01:52:39.369 --> 01:52:41.371
Come on.

01:52:42.872 --> 01:52:45.124
Michael, stop that goddamn
crying and take the pill.

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:46.209
I--

01:52:58.138 --> 01:53:01.641
I--

01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:04.143
I feel like
Old Man River.

01:53:04.144 --> 01:53:06.646
I'm tired of living
and I'm scared of dying.

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:07.647
Shh.

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:11.151
Shh. Michael.

01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:12.652
Come on. Come on.

01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:13.653
Shh.

01:53:15.155 --> 01:53:18.158
Michael.

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:20.160
Shh. Shh.

01:53:25.665 --> 01:53:27.166
I'm sorry.

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:47.403
If we could just not
hate ourselves so much.

01:53:50.907 --> 01:53:52.909
That's it, you know.

01:53:54.911 --> 01:53:58.414
If we could just learn
not to hate ourselves...

01:53:59.916 --> 01:54:01.417
quite so very much.

01:54:01.417 --> 01:54:04.420
I know. I know.

01:54:06.923 --> 01:54:10.426
Um-- Inconceivable as
it may be...

01:54:10.426 --> 01:54:12.928
you used to be worse
than you are now.

01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:15.932
Maybe with
a lot more work, you--

01:54:15.932 --> 01:54:17.934
You'll be able to help
yourself some more.

01:54:17.934 --> 01:54:19.435
If you try, huh?

01:54:25.441 --> 01:54:28.944
Who was it who
always used to say...

01:54:28.945 --> 01:54:31.447
"You show me
a happy homosexual,

01:54:31.447 --> 01:54:34.450
and I'll show you
a gay corpse."

01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:37.453
I don't know. Who was it
that always used to say that?

01:54:39.956 --> 01:54:41.457
And how dare you come on

01:54:41.457 --> 01:54:43.959
with that holier-than-thou
attitude with me.

01:54:44.961 --> 01:54:48.464
With a lot more work, indeed.

01:54:48.464 --> 01:54:49.965
You've got
a long row to hoe

01:54:49.966 --> 01:54:50.967
before you're perfect,
you know.

01:54:50.967 --> 01:54:52.969
I never said
I didn't.

01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:55.471
And while we're
on the subject,

01:54:55.471 --> 01:54:57.473
I think your analyst
is a quack.

01:54:57.473 --> 01:54:59.475
Earlier, you said
he was a prick.

01:54:59.475 --> 01:55:01.143
That's right.
He's a quack prick.

01:55:01.144 --> 01:55:04.230
Or a prick quack,
whichever you prefer.

01:55:27.370 --> 01:55:29.839
Oh, icks,
icks, icks.

01:55:31.791 --> 01:55:33.292
Terrible icks.

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:41.301
Tomorrow is gonna be
an ick-packed day.

01:55:57.817 --> 01:55:59.368
Do you suppose there's
any possibility

01:55:59.369 --> 01:56:01.237
of just flushing
this place?

01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:20.973
Where are you going?

01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.261
There's a midnight Mass
at St. Malachy's.

01:56:25.261 --> 01:56:27.263
I thought I'd
walk over and catch it.

01:56:28.765 --> 01:56:30.266
Well, pray for me.

01:56:32.268 --> 01:56:34.770
Maybe they'll be gone
when I get back.

01:56:34.771 --> 01:56:36.773
Well, I will be...

01:56:36.773 --> 01:56:39.659
just as soon as I knock off
this bottle of brandy.

01:56:43.746 --> 01:56:44.696
Will I see you
next Saturday?

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:47.667
Unless you have other plans.

01:56:49.585 --> 01:56:50.953
No.

01:56:52.372 --> 01:56:53.373
Michael.

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:54.874
What?

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:57.877
Did he ever tell you why
he was crying on the phone?

01:56:57.877 --> 01:56:59.378
What it was
he had to tell you?

01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:03.349
No.

01:57:03.349 --> 01:57:06.352
It must have been
that he'd left Fran.

01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.857
Or maybe it was
something else,

01:57:10.857 --> 01:57:11.941
and he changed
his mind.

01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:14.526
Uh, maybe so.

01:57:14.527 --> 01:57:15.394
I wonder why he left her.

01:57:20.483 --> 01:57:24.487
As my father said to me
when he died in my arms...

01:57:24.487 --> 01:57:27.990
"I don't understand any of it.

01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:29.408
I never did."

01:57:32.662 --> 01:57:34.664
Turn the lights off
when you leave.
