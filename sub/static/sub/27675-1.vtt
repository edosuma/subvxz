12:38.245 --> 12:40.845
Head Boys notoriously peak too early.
I'd watch out, if I were you.

12:41.205 --> 12:42.165
Oh, yeah?

12:42.485 --> 12:44.845
[Adam] I said, nice rack, Wiley.

12:44.925 --> 12:45.885
[laughter]

12:47.525 --> 12:49.565
-Say that again.
-Nice... ra--

12:49.645 --> 12:50.765
-[grunts]
-[groans]

12:53.485 --> 12:55.165
You did kind of deserve that, man.

13:09.365 --> 13:10.925
Settle down, class.

13:11.445 --> 13:13.885
Settle down. Thank you.

13:13.965 --> 13:15.205
[claps hands] Ahh!

13:15.285 --> 13:19.485
We're jumping straight in to
the romantic world of the immortal Bard.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.245
Shakespeare, obviously.

13:21.325 --> 13:24.245
This year's first assignment
will be on <i>As You Like It.</i>

13:24.325 --> 13:27.245
Set in the fictional forest of Arden.

13:27.325 --> 13:30.125
Uh, nice of you to join us, Adam.

13:30.525 --> 13:32.205
Uh, you'll be doing presentations

13:32.285 --> 13:35.365
on Shakespeare's relationship
with love and disguise.

13:35.445 --> 13:39.405
The person you are sat next to now
will be your partner for the project.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.365
So if you just look at your sheets,

13:41.445 --> 13:43.285
you're gonna go through
all the five points.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.045
I want you to talk in pairs.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.525
Please listen, right? Listening is key.

13:48.605 --> 13:50.845
So, um, the assignment brief, um...

13:50.925 --> 13:55.205
Examine the ways that Rosalind,
uh, tests Orlando's love for her

13:55.285 --> 13:57.085
-in act four...
-And who are you?

13:57.165 --> 14:01.325
-Um... I'm Otis. Yeah.
-Act four, scene one. The impression...

14:01.405 --> 14:04.005
-I guess we're partners for the project.
-Are you new?

14:04.085 --> 14:06.525
No. No, no, no.
I've been here since first year.

14:06.885 --> 14:08.685
-We had chemistry together...
-Explore the ways

14:08.765 --> 14:10.845
-Shakespeare uses witty wordplay...
-...last term.

14:10.925 --> 14:13.765
-You set my desk on fire.
-...sport and wrestling analogies...

14:13.845 --> 14:15.805
-Anyway.
-...to reveal his characters' views

14:15.885 --> 14:19.645
-on the subject of love.
-Maybe later on we can get together.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.725
-I know the library's open...
-[chuckles]

14:22.405 --> 14:24.045
I don't do after hours, new kid.

14:24.125 --> 14:26.365
-Uh, discuss the concepts of fortune...
-Where do you live?

14:26.445 --> 14:30.165
...and nature as they apply to Orlando
and, um, and Oliver.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.725
-43 Ashford Street.
-Compare and contrast the relationship...

14:32.805 --> 14:33.845
I'll be there at 6:00.

14:33.925 --> 14:35.245
...Orlando with Rosalind and Celia.

14:35.325 --> 14:39.085
Um... If you have any questions,
please, uh, do ask.

14:39.165 --> 14:42.125
But what I'd like you to do is,
really, first, just mind map.

14:42.205 --> 14:43.805
Mind map together...

14:44.365 --> 14:45.445
-Um--
-Boring.

14:45.525 --> 14:47.765
What? Excuse me, this is boring?

14:48.205 --> 14:49.485
-Okay, um...
-[bell rings]

14:57.085 --> 14:58.605
[Eric] You told Adam where you live?

14:59.045 --> 15:00.085
-He asked me.
-[groans]

15:00.525 --> 15:03.525
Dude, your mum has a lot
of weird sex shit in the house.

15:03.965 --> 15:05.285
I'm cool with it, obviously,

15:05.365 --> 15:10.045
but if that guy even sees a <i>Kama Sutra,</i>
he will destroy your life.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.325
-She won't be home.
-Oh. She better not be.

15:13.485 --> 15:16.045
He still calls me Tromboner.
It's been four years.

15:16.325 --> 15:17.485
Four years.

15:17.885 --> 15:21.565
You did get an erection on the stage,
in front of the entire school.

15:21.645 --> 15:23.005
It was a <i>semi!</i>

15:26.085 --> 15:27.965
The nickname doesn't even make sense.

15:28.645 --> 15:29.845
I play the French horn.

15:30.405 --> 15:31.765
Such a philistine.

15:31.845 --> 15:34.885
[Otis] Look, he'll be in my house
for an hour, tops. It will be fine.

15:35.965 --> 15:38.845
Do you reckon his brain is so small
'cause his dick is so big?

15:39.485 --> 15:41.205
-That's a myth.
-Well, it's not.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.165
A friend of a friend saw it once.

15:43.245 --> 15:46.085
She said it was the size of two Coke cans.
One on top of the other.

15:46.165 --> 15:47.725
Length and width.

15:48.085 --> 15:50.885
-You don't have any friends. Except me.
-Not for long.

15:51.285 --> 15:54.005
Because Adam is going to kill you
in your own home.

15:55.445 --> 15:56.885
[Eric laughs]

15:56.965 --> 15:58.325
[grunting]

16:01.445 --> 16:04.365
[girl] Do you really think this place
has asbestos in it?

16:04.525 --> 16:07.365
[Maeve] I don't know.
There's worse ways to go, I suppose.

16:07.445 --> 16:10.925
God, yeah. My auntie got eaten by wasps.

16:11.205 --> 16:13.805
What? Was she stung to death?
[chuckles]

16:13.885 --> 16:14.765
No.

16:15.045 --> 16:16.165
She was eaten.

16:18.485 --> 16:19.405
[gasps]

16:19.485 --> 16:21.925
Scabby Queen. I win! I win!

16:22.005 --> 16:24.405
No, you don't.
You have to get rid of the queen.

16:25.005 --> 16:27.685
-You lost, sorry.
-I still don't get this game.

16:27.765 --> 16:28.645
Hand them over.

16:30.325 --> 16:31.525
Thank you.

16:39.845 --> 16:42.845
-[Maeve] How’s it going with Knobzilla?
-He can't come.

16:44.165 --> 16:47.085
So, the other night,
we're, like, goin' and goin'.

16:47.165 --> 16:50.005
[American accent] And I'm losin' my shit.
[speaks normally] And I, you know...

16:50.085 --> 16:51.925
-Reached the summit.
-Yeah.

16:52.005 --> 16:54.125
But he, like...

16:54.205 --> 16:56.525
-Slipped and dropped the yogurt?
-No, I wish.

16:56.925 --> 16:57.845
He faked it.

16:58.365 --> 16:59.205
You sure?

17:01.445 --> 17:03.085
I don't know what I'm doin' wrong.

17:03.965 --> 17:05.485
[Maeve] Maybe he was nervous
or something.

17:05.565 --> 17:07.765
Ruby and Olivia think I should dump him.

17:07.845 --> 17:10.325
They say he's bringin' down
my social status, but...

17:11.125 --> 17:14.165
The thing is, he can be really sweet
when nobody's watchin'.

17:14.925 --> 17:16.805
[Maeve] Don't know why you listen
to those dickheads.

17:17.165 --> 17:18.685
If you like him, do what you want.

17:19.765 --> 17:20.845
[girl] Tits.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.365
They're looking for me.

17:23.925 --> 17:25.605
-Thanks for the game.
-No worries.

17:25.685 --> 17:26.725
And the chat.

17:29.285 --> 17:31.485
-Oh, and--
-Don't worry, you were never here.

17:32.045 --> 17:33.885
-Ta-ra, lad.
-See you later, pet.

17:38.925 --> 17:39.885
[girl] Hiya!

17:41.165 --> 17:43.005
-Where have you been?
-Nowhere.

17:43.485 --> 17:44.445
Biology went over.

17:44.525 --> 17:47.125
We thought you were doin' it
with your whale dick boyfriend.

17:47.925 --> 17:49.645
You know he's a delinquent, right?

17:52.045 --> 17:54.925
Yuck. Is that ham?
We're vegan now, remember?

17:55.005 --> 17:56.405
-Oh, right, yeah, I forgot.
-[sniffs]

17:56.485 --> 17:57.685
Have you been smokin' again?

17:58.005 --> 17:59.405
-No, I haven't.
-Good.

17:59.485 --> 18:01.445
Because smoking is definitely not vegan.

18:04.725 --> 18:05.845
My ham.

18:12.845 --> 18:13.765
Have you got the money?

18:14.965 --> 18:16.245
You taking the piss?

18:17.285 --> 18:18.445
[boy] Take it or leave it.

18:19.085 --> 18:20.125
[tuts]

18:27.045 --> 18:29.685
-Tell anyone and I'll maim you.
-This better be an A.

19:02.165 --> 19:04.645
[sighs]

19:06.445 --> 19:07.565
[knock at door]

19:11.045 --> 19:13.605
-You're on time.
-How long is this gonna take, new kid?

19:13.885 --> 19:15.005
Well, um--

19:15.085 --> 19:16.245
I'm already bored.

19:19.685 --> 19:21.005
Have you got any Nesquik?

19:22.165 --> 19:23.845
On-- Only Mana.

19:34.205 --> 19:35.445
Do you wanna get monged?

19:35.845 --> 19:36.805
Um...

19:37.405 --> 19:38.845
No, thank you.

19:47.405 --> 19:50.485
-Why is there a minge on your wall?
-What? Where? That's...

19:50.565 --> 19:51.445
Uh... [clears throat]

19:51.525 --> 19:53.125
That's just an orchid. [chuckles]

19:53.205 --> 19:54.805
It's... My mum's super into...

19:55.125 --> 19:56.445
flora and fauna.

19:56.525 --> 19:57.805
-[sighs]
-[lighter sparks]

19:57.885 --> 19:59.085
Ooh, uh...

19:59.165 --> 20:00.725
Maybe not inside, sorry.

20:02.805 --> 20:05.805
I mean, Adam, we've only been working
for half an hour, so...

20:05.885 --> 20:06.805
Yeah.

20:06.885 --> 20:08.365
You should keep goin'.

20:08.805 --> 20:10.445
[sighs]

20:12.165 --> 20:14.085
[woman] <i>That's it,</i>
<i>just rolling the testicle...</i>

20:14.165 --> 20:16.925
-There's a ball bag on the TV.
<i>-Good.</i>

20:17.005 --> 20:18.885
Sorry. Sorry, I, uh...

20:19.125 --> 20:21.645
I forgot to take my... my DVD out.
It's my...

20:22.245 --> 20:24.325
-It's my porn.
-A bit old school.

20:25.885 --> 20:28.565
You should get on Pornhub.
There's loads of stuff on there.

20:28.845 --> 20:31.005
You could watch a CGI demon fuck a horse.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.085
-Hm.
-I need to piss.

20:35.205 --> 20:36.925
Upstairs, on your right.

20:42.485 --> 20:44.205
[urinating]

20:53.565 --> 20:55.085
[zips]

22:05.325 --> 22:06.805
[Adam] New kid!

22:09.325 --> 22:10.485
Adam?

22:11.605 --> 22:12.605
Get in here!

22:13.045 --> 22:13.925
Oh!

22:14.005 --> 22:14.925
Adam!

22:15.805 --> 22:17.005
Oh... [splutters]

22:19.245 --> 22:20.685
-You've got a sex dungeon.
-No.

22:20.765 --> 22:22.325
No, this is not. I...

22:22.765 --> 22:26.005
I can explain. This is my mum's office
and she's a therapist.

22:26.085 --> 22:27.765
-Sex therapist.
-I don't know what that is.

22:28.125 --> 22:30.285
She helps people with sex problems.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.125
-She's a prostitute.
-No.

22:32.445 --> 22:35.325
-Like a pimp.
-No, no, she's like a... a shrink.

22:35.605 --> 22:38.965
But instead of talking about mental health
stuff, she talks about sex.

22:39.085 --> 22:40.045
People's sex lives.

22:40.925 --> 22:42.845
She-- She helps people bone better.

22:43.605 --> 22:45.005
Yes, in essence.

22:47.045 --> 22:48.285
Look, um...

22:50.165 --> 22:52.245
Could you not tell anyone
about this, please?

22:52.325 --> 22:54.605
-[door closes]
-[Jean] Otis, darling?

22:54.685 --> 22:56.085
-I'm home!
-[gasps]

22:58.005 --> 23:00.085
[birdsong]

23:06.045 --> 23:07.485
[chuckles]

23:08.445 --> 23:10.125
Mm! Mmm...

23:10.845 --> 23:12.725
[inhaling]

23:12.805 --> 23:14.165
[exhaling]

23:14.525 --> 23:16.925
God, that's strong stuff.

23:18.125 --> 23:21.205
It is chronic shit.

23:21.725 --> 23:23.925
-[Jean] I'm already hungry.
-[Adam chuckles]

23:24.725 --> 23:27.445
It's snack time. [giggles]

23:35.845 --> 23:36.805
Your mum's cool.

23:37.205 --> 23:38.285
Why aren't you cool?

23:39.685 --> 23:41.605
And she's hot.
Why didn't you say she was hot?

23:42.165 --> 23:43.925
Because she's my mum.

23:44.005 --> 23:46.965
-I mean, seriously, are you adopted?
-No.

23:47.045 --> 23:48.845
-Then why are you so shit?
-[Jean] Adam.

23:48.925 --> 23:49.805
Yeah?

23:51.205 --> 23:52.765
[Jean] Do you smoke every day?

23:53.525 --> 23:56.285
Yeah. Yeah, most days, Mrs., um...

23:56.365 --> 23:57.685
Oh, just call me Jean.

23:58.325 --> 24:01.085
You know, they've been doing
some interesting studies with cannabis.

24:01.485 --> 24:03.885
They're just starting to wake up
to its health benefits.

24:03.965 --> 24:05.645
Yeah? Like, um...

24:06.525 --> 24:08.405
How it makes everything funny?

24:08.645 --> 24:10.685
-You know, like your face.
-Hm?

24:10.765 --> 24:12.005
Ever so serious,

24:12.685 --> 24:14.125
like a... atlas.

24:14.725 --> 24:16.405
[both giggle]

24:21.845 --> 24:26.685
However, it has been linked
to early onset impotence.

24:27.565 --> 24:29.005
Nothing conclusive yet.

24:30.285 --> 24:32.125
But be careful
with how much you smoke.

24:32.205 --> 24:33.045
Mum...

24:33.605 --> 24:37.285
I only bring it up
because I have a number of clients

24:37.365 --> 24:40.125
who were heavy drug users at your age,

24:40.645 --> 24:43.085
and now they have trouble
with sexual performance.

24:43.765 --> 24:46.565
-Sexual performance?
-They have trouble finishing.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.605
-Ejaculation.
-Hm.

24:50.845 --> 24:52.365
Jizz, spunk.

24:53.245 --> 24:54.085
Man milk!

24:54.165 --> 24:56.365
-Mum, Jesus Christ!
-Don't have a problem with that.

24:56.445 --> 24:59.045
What makes you think
I've got a problem with that?

24:59.485 --> 25:01.565
I didn't say you had a problem with that.

25:03.965 --> 25:07.005
-But if you want to talk about it--
-I... Uh, okay, I'm gonna go.

25:07.085 --> 25:08.085
I'm gonna go.

25:09.805 --> 25:11.325
[Jean] Okay, Adam!

25:12.085 --> 25:14.005
-Nice to meet you!
-Mum!

25:14.725 --> 25:16.205
Come and hang out again.

25:16.965 --> 25:19.765
Adam! Adam, wait. Wait.

25:19.845 --> 25:22.565
You and your mum are freaks.

25:31.165 --> 25:33.165
I hope I didn't touch a nerve.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.965
Your friend is very sensitive.

25:36.205 --> 25:37.845
Ooh, my mouth is immensely dry.

25:37.925 --> 25:40.045
Mum, how many times have I said

25:40.125 --> 25:42.845
you can't go around
therapizing people you don't know?

25:42.925 --> 25:45.405
Your generation is so touchy.

25:45.485 --> 25:48.485
-Information is empowering.
-No, it's fucked up!

25:48.685 --> 25:51.565
Okay, calm down, take a breath.
