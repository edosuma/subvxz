01:48.520 --> 01:50.761
- Home.
- Home.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.249
Here's to low-balling
the seller

01:55.400 --> 01:57.323
and still getting 50,000 off
after the home inspection.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.448
We could paint this place today,
sell it tomorrow

01:59.600 --> 02:01.329
and still make money.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.209
Yes, we could.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.247
- I love you, Jack Watson.
- I love you.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.126
Now, let me carry you
over that goddamn threshold.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.049
Ooh! Wait, stop.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.521
- Let's not squander the moment!
- I peed a little bit.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.490
- Oh, God! Really? Eugh!
- No, it's OK. It's just...

02:21.640 --> 02:23.369
The babies are pushing
on my bladder.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.841
Will you hand me a tissue?
A paper towel?

02:26.040 --> 02:27.883
- I got it.
- Thanks, baby.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.244
- Hi!
- New, uh...

02:32.400 --> 02:34.402
- Sorry.
- New parents, soon to be.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.289
Jack. Vanessa.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.647
- Hi!
- She pees a lot.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.763
OK.

02:40.920 --> 02:44.163
Come on. Ah! Oh, my God!

02:44.320 --> 02:47.290
If it makes you feel any better,
I just peed a little bit too.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.649
- Jesus, you are fat! Oh, my God!
- Honey! Honey!

02:50.800 --> 02:53.201
Oh, my God!

02:53.400 --> 02:55.084
- Oh!
- Please stop!

02:55.240 --> 02:57.607
Oh! Oh, my God!

03:08.080 --> 03:10.845
- Oh! Ow! Shit!
- Sweetie!

03:11.040 --> 03:13.088
What are you doing?!

03:13.240 --> 03:14.765
What are you doing?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.724
I found this lamp
up in the attic.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.649
I thought I'd get it
working again.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.126
No.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.851
Oh, shit! That hurt so bad!

03:23.000 --> 03:25.002
Please, God, let it be.
That thing'll kill somebody.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.525
Alright. Alright.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.246
Oh! I know
what I want you to do.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.801
If you have time,
I would really love for you

03:31.960 --> 03:34.327
to paint over the "Ms 13"
graffiti on the front porch,

03:34.520 --> 03:35.885
first thing.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.088
- My God, you're so adorable.
- Why am I...

03:38.240 --> 03:41.687
"Ms 13". It's "MS-13".

03:41.840 --> 03:45.561
Mara Salvatrucha.
It's this gang out of El Salvador.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.405
It's the deadliest gang
in the world.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.289
One of the...
Don't tell the Crips that.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.363
But they're the deadliest gang
in the world.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.761
So not only
is our new house tagged,

03:54.960 --> 03:57.850
it's tagged by a famous gang.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.889
Yeah. It's like Banksy.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.769
You know how much
you love Banksy.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.048
It's like that,
except, you know,

04:04.200 --> 04:06.851
with knives and face tattoos.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.402
- Oh, my God.
- What?

04:10.600 --> 04:13.046
This is the worst idea
of our fives.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.964
The Lower Lower
Garden District?

04:16.120 --> 04:18.043
Hm!

04:18.200 --> 04:20.123
People don't even know
this neighbourhood exists.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.449
No, that's actually not true.
That's not true.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.921
White people don't know that
this neighbourhood exists.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.809
This neighbourhood
is on the upswing.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.610
I read all about it in "Dwell".

04:29.760 --> 04:31.808
You're not just a little
nervous in this house?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.809
Hey.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.606
There is not one thing
to be afraid of in this house.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.690
- OK?
- OK.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.485
Oh, my God! Honey!
Get something!

04:44.640 --> 04:47.086
Goodness gracious,
y'all gave me a fright!

04:47.240 --> 04:49.607
What are you doing out there?

04:49.760 --> 04:52.081
I'm so sorry - I was just
standin' in your breezeway

04:52.240 --> 04:53.969
like some kind of
ne'er-do-well.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.929
Well, come on in.
Make yourself at home.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.401
I absolutely will do that,
thank you very much.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.166
Please allow me to introduce myself.
I am Fresnel Edmonds.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.044
I live across the way
over here.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.771
And you are
Jack and Vanessa!

05:05.920 --> 05:08.287
Jack, you're a PhD student
at Tulane University.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.169
How are you? Vanessa.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.890
You are
an occupational therapist

05:12.080 --> 05:13.923
expecting your first baby.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.805
- Yep.
- Wow. You know a lot about us.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.402
Come on, y'all - you can't move
into the 'Maison de Sang'

05:20.560 --> 05:22.085
and not raise a few eyebrows.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.890
- Frenell?
- F'resnel.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.963
It's spelled
just like it sounds.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.088
Yeah, F-apostrophe-R-E-S-N-E-L.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.050
It's really nice
to meet you.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.362
It's very nice to meet
the two of you as well.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.484
- Sorry we screamed.
- I'm sorry I screamed.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.087
- Did you say 'Maison de Sang'?
- Yeah.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.368
Oh, yeah. That's what
all the locals call it.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.410
That's the name we've been
using for years and years.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.289
Oh! Well, that's cool.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.363
This place has
a nickname already.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.807
It's like 'Tara'
or 'Twelve Oaks'.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.691
- A little bit like that.
- Well, that's very Southern.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.888
It is very Southern.
What does it mean?

05:57.080 --> 06:00.050
- 'House of Blood'.
- What?

06:00.200 --> 06:02.089
'House of Blood'.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.124
And, of course, the Cajuns,
they like to call it

06:06.280 --> 06:11.446
'Lieu Oú Les Morts
Ne Sommeillent Jamais'.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.165
- Oh, I like that.
- Ain't that pretty?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.288
- I love the sound.
- And what does that one mean?

06:15.440 --> 06:17.647
'Place where the dead
never rest'.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.531
Then, of course,
there's also 'Casa Perderosa'.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.444
That's Spanish
for 'House of the lost'.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.604
And some call it 'the spooky
old house on down the way'.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.569
But nothin' for y'all
to worry about. No, no.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.123
Nobody has been murdered
in this house in a long time.

06:32.280 --> 06:35.204
I mean, it's not like anybody
got murdered here yesterday.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.169
Wow, see?

06:37.320 --> 06:40.244
Nobody's been murdered here
for a long, long, long time.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.131
- Years, it sounds like.
- I'm sorry. Did I say years?

06:43.280 --> 06:46.568
If I did, I misspoke.
There have been very recent murders.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.247
It's just that, uh, not any
in this calendar year.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.246
By 'calendar year',
do you mean since January?

06:54.400 --> 06:56.846
Exactly.
None in this calendar year.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.889
Well, that's four solid months.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.088
Well, give or take.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.449
Probably more like three and a half,
maybe two and a half.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.331
I'll go, like,
two months and a week.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.608
But don't get me wrong.
It's a great house.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.728
It got really good bones.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.804
You mean structurally, right?

07:14.960 --> 07:17.406
Not like there's bones
in here someplace!

07:17.560 --> 07:20.166
Sure, sure, Vanessa.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.529
- Let's say that's what I meant.
- Ohhh...

07:26.920 --> 07:29.969
Well, I will now be on my way.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.762
So if y'all need anything,
I'll always be real close by.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.604
Goodnight to you both.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.081
- Goodnight, F'resnel.
- Goodnight, now.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.566
- Oh!
- Baby, can you...

07:43.720 --> 07:45.449
Arggh!

07:45.600 --> 07:47.329
- I apologise.
- Oh, my God! F'resnel!

07:47.480 --> 07:49.801
Almost had the babies
right there.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.689
Let me get it.
I'm sorry, y'all.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.320
It sticks on the inside.
You gotta jimmy it a bit.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.289
But it's real easy
to get open and closed

07:56.440 --> 07:58.681
and get access to the home
at any point in time

07:58.840 --> 08:00.922
during the day or night
from the outside.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.804
OK. Thanks, F'resnel.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.570
- Goodnight to you, now.
- Thanks. Goodnight.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.690
- We have to get a lock on this.
- I know, I know.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.969
What the fuck?

08:29.880 --> 08:32.530
And while confronting the demon

08:32.679 --> 08:34.761
that was inhabiting
the young woman's body,

08:34.919 --> 08:37.287
Father Innocente was...

08:37.440 --> 08:39.727
Himpaled, with an umbrella.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.291
There was blood everywhere.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.364
Not a very fitting end for
such a fine man of the cloth,

08:44.520 --> 08:48.241
to be stab-bed with
the pointy end of an umbrella.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.290
It was actually not
the pointy kind of umbrella.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.886
It was actually one of those
little stubby umbrellas.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.805
It had, like, the logo
of a local radio station on it.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.689
One of those, you know?

08:58.840 --> 09:01.207
It had the face of this guy
they call the Locador.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.091
He's like a crazy luchador
of good times.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.730
And his face
was on the umbrella.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.008
The umbrella comes popping
through the chest

09:08.160 --> 09:09.764
of Father Innocente.

09:09.920 --> 09:13.720
It pop open. His heart
still pump for a few beats.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.484
Blood sprays everywhere.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.440
It was not something
you forget right away.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.446
- It's all in the report, sir.
- Yes, about the report.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.648
There is an awful lot
of details

09:25.800 --> 09:29.930
about the impaling of Father Innocente
with the umbrella.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.686
Next time, I don't need
so many details.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.405
Just, yeah, broad strokes.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.847
- The gist.
- Si.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.800
Eminence, I must tell you this.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.648
It was probably the kind
of umbrella they give you

09:45.800 --> 09:48.087
if you go to an event that
the radio station is hosting.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.969
Swag.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.088
And this is the thing
that popped through the chest.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.129
You know, like the dinosaur.
This one.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.290
This is how it pop open,
and blood spray every place.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.250
- It was really, really weird.
- It was really weird.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.210
So weird.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.564
Look, boys, I know
this was a very rough one,

10:10.720 --> 10:12.563
but I may have
another job for you.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.449
What is the case?

10:14.600 --> 10:17.524
It's a real doozy.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.927
You're already
playing catch-up.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.321
Take a look at that photo.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.608
- So gross.
- Super gross.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.684
- Super gross.
- This is just a photograph.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.606
In real life,
it's far more horrifying.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.762
Get your asses on the chopper.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.885
We are going to need...
some per diem.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.490
You know that's not me, right?
I hope that wasn't for me.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.007
- No, no, no.
- I was reminding myself.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.561
"Go to Accounting.
We're going to need some per diem."

10:50.720 --> 10:53.246
Level four. The guy down below.
The hunchback.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.562
Yeah, near the fingers
of St Peter.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.046
Don't let F'resnel
get to you even for a second.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.043
Let me put it to you
this way.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.089
If you were gonna buy
a lottery ticket,

11:03.240 --> 11:05.163
which I know you wouldn't,
because we're snobs,

11:05.320 --> 11:07.243
would you buy it
from the same exact 7-Eleven

11:07.400 --> 11:09.323
where the last winning
lottery ticket was sold?

11:09.520 --> 11:12.000
No. That's like lightning
striking the same place twice.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.889
Yeah. Precisely.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.123
So the fact that there have been
a couple of murders here...

11:17.320 --> 11:21.564
- Several.
- Several murders.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.326
The chance of there being
one murder

11:24.480 --> 11:27.450
are so slim statistically.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.331
A couple?
I mean, it's almost impossible.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.209
So one more? Forget it.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.569
You're safer than in any of
the murder-free places we've lived.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.322
You coming to bed, baby?

11:48.360 --> 11:49.646
Vanessa?

11:52.440 --> 11:54.283
Sweetie?

12:57.360 --> 12:58.771
Huh.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.683
<i>Hi, Vanessa.
This is Dr Marsden.</i>

13:17.840 --> 13:20.650
<i>I was looking at the latest ultrasound,
and I have to say,</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:23.451
<i>I'm...well, I'm not
quite sure how to say this.</i>

13:23.600 --> 13:25.364
<i>I'm horrified.</i>

13:25.520 --> 13:27.284
<i>Not just as a doctor,
but as a person.</i>

13:27.440 --> 13:29.522
<i>You need to come to the office
immediately...</i>

13:29.680 --> 13:30.727
Arggh!

13:59.200 --> 14:02.841
Oh! Shit! Fuck you, lamp!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.810
Don't take no shit
off that lamp, Jack.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.770
- Thank you, sweetie.
- You're welcome.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.651
Oh, honey. Don't forget.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.689
<i>My sister's coming
to bless the house this week.</i>

14:13.840 --> 14:16.605
I don't know, baby.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.082
That stuffs a little too
Burning Man for me, you know.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.402
Jack. Please.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.211
It's something that
she wants to do for us, OK?

14:25.360 --> 14:26.850
OK.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.002
- Plus Curly Bear left her.
- The Navaho guy?

14:29.160 --> 14:32.209
Mm-hm. He stole all
her credit cards and her car.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.408
- Oh, my God, that's crazy.
- Mm-hm.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.524
- Marjorie has credit cards?
- Jack.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.365
I did not expect that. It takes
a lot to get credit cards.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.925
It takes credit.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.003
- Be nice.
- Who knew?

14:44.160 --> 14:47.004
Be nice. And let her
do her Wicca thing.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.003
Eugh! God.

14:54.680 --> 14:55.567
Vanessa!

14:55.720 --> 14:57.290
Yes, darling?

14:57.440 --> 14:59.169
What was in that drink
you gave me?

14:59.320 --> 15:01.607
Iced tea, darling.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.647
That's pure paint thinner, baby.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.251
My bad.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.926
You could have killed me.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.208
I'm so sorry.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.240
It's pregnant mommy brain.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.289
I must have misread the bottle.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.247
- Are you feelin' alright?
- What?!

15:25.440 --> 15:28.569
You don't seem alright.
You seem...kind of off.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.041
Me? No!

15:31.240 --> 15:32.685
I feel great.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.729
I've actually
never felt better.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.484
Oh!

15:41.640 --> 15:44.211
Whew. Sorry about that.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.251
Bitches be trippin'!

15:50.400 --> 15:52.004
Am I right?

15:53.040 --> 15:56.283
That's some crazy shit.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.011
I apologise, man.
I just scared the fuck out of you.

15:59.160 --> 16:02.289
I just woke up
in your crawl space

16:02.480 --> 16:04.528
and I was tryin' to tiptoe
through to the bathroom

16:04.680 --> 16:07.411
without bein' seen,
and...

16:07.560 --> 16:10.882
It was to no avail.
You know what I'm sayin'?

16:12.600 --> 16:15.331
Did I hear you correctly?
You're sleeping in my crawl space?

16:15.480 --> 16:17.369
Oh, my goodness, yes. Yes.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.807
How can I explain this
to you, Jack?

16:21.040 --> 16:23.361
You know that Shakespeare play
where the man says,

16:23.520 --> 16:25.284
“Neither a borrower
nor a lender be,

16:25.440 --> 16:27.169
"but to thine own self
be true"?

16:27.320 --> 16:30.369
Yeah. It's Polonius to Laertes,
'Hamlet', act 1, scene 3.

16:30.520 --> 16:34.923
Well, colour me impressed,
Jack Watson.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.445
Colour.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.005
Me.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.241
Im.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.406
Pressed.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.762
Wow.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.565
Hello? Who's there?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.809
Oh, my God.

18:09.840 --> 18:14.562
Hey, Vanessa!
I'm gonna take a nap, alright? I'm beat.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.529
Of course.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.371
Oh! Oh, my God, baby.
Don't, don't, don't!

18:40.520 --> 18:44.650
<i>Oh, my God, no. I can't...
I'm so sweaty. I'm so... I'm...</i>

18:44.800 --> 18:48.009
Oh, my God, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.528
Nice. Would you do that thing...
Do that thing you did in Cancun.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.047
Do that... Ow! Ow!
Oh, my God!

18:54.200 --> 18:55.565
<i>Huh! Oh, G...</i>

18:55.720 --> 18:57.722
Arggh! God! Hey! Careful!

18:57.880 --> 18:59.928
Careful, baby! Ow!

19:00.080 --> 19:01.764
Honey!

19:01.920 --> 19:06.005
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

19:09.440 --> 19:11.090
Honey, what's wrong?

19:11.240 --> 19:13.049
- Oh, my God!
- I didn't do anything.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.282
- What did you do?!
- I thought it was you.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.920
You thought it was me?
You meant to kill me?

19:18.080 --> 19:20.526
- No.
- Why do you have a boner?

19:20.720 --> 19:23.769
- Honey? What's going an?
- Oh, my God!

19:23.920 --> 19:26.605
- Oh, God. This looks terrible.
- Honey, who is she?

19:26.760 --> 19:29.411
I don't know who she is!
She crept up on me.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.080
- You don't know who she is?
- She crept up on me!

19:32.240 --> 19:36.165
She snuck... I don't know.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.169
Jack!

19:38.360 --> 19:41.807
No, no, no. We have to...
We have to... We have to...

19:41.960 --> 19:44.247
- She'll be OK.
- She's not OK!

19:44.400 --> 19:45.765
- What?
- She's not OK.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.570
- No, no. She's not dead.
- She is dead.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.200
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

19:50.360 --> 19:52.089
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.810
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!

19:54.000 --> 19:55.923
Oh, God.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.851
OK. OK.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.083
No. No cops.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.242
Are you insane?
I just killed somebody!

20:05.400 --> 20:08.483
Jesus Christ, Jack.
Jesus Christ!

20:10.040 --> 20:11.644
When did you
start smoking again?

20:11.800 --> 20:15.088
That doesn't matter.
Three hours ago. Let me think, OK?

20:17.480 --> 20:19.482
This woman is dead.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.405
Even if you tell your side,
who would believe it?

20:22.560 --> 20:25.643
You want to be in jail
for the first years of my twins' life?

20:25.800 --> 20:27.848
I've got to tell people
what really happened.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.810
OK. OK. OK, baby.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.048
OK.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.282
What's the story, Jack?

20:37.440 --> 20:41.365
Um... She tried to perform
oral sex on me.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.605
And then I bludgeoned her to death
with a fire-extinguisher.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.167
Holy shit! Oh, my God.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.084
It sounds like I mouth-raped
somebody's grandmother

20:50.240 --> 20:52.129
and then murdered her.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.969
You can't go to jail.
We have babies on the way.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.043
Let me think!

21:21.120 --> 21:22.167
Dig.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.326
- Oh, shit-balls!
- What?

21:31.480 --> 21:33.801
You're supposed to call the city
before you dig.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.962
There could be gas lines
anywhere.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.724
That's real smart, Jack.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.645
Let's call the city
and tell them

21:40.800 --> 21:44.486
precisely where we're getting
rid of a corpse from a murder.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.802
That's fair.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.811
- Did you just hear...
- No.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.281
I didn't even finish my question.
You just said no.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.010
I didn't hear anything.

21:57.160 --> 22:00.562
And if you did hear something,
it's probably nothing.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.924
Oh, shit! Don't move a muscle.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.765
There's a big fuckin' dog
staring right at you.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.088
Invisitis.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.045
Seriously?!

22:25.200 --> 22:28.522
What the fuck is going on
right now?!

22:28.680 --> 22:31.490
- You speak bull mastiff?
- Rottweiler.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.249
- Are you crying?
- No.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.290
- You're crying.
- I was dry-crying.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.568
'Cause I was laughing
a little bit too.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.842
I want you
to see a psychiatrist.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.488
Will that make you feel better?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.530
Yes, it will.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.490
Then OK.

23:27.960 --> 23:32.010
Well, a big hello to you two.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.164
You must be Jack and Vanessa.
Or the other way around?

23:37.000 --> 23:40.049
- I'm Dr Marshall.
- You're... Oh, hi.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.248
I apologise for
the Lance Armstrong outfit.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.125
- I am just nuts about biking.
- Us too.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.931
Really?
What kind of bike you got?

23:49.280 --> 23:50.850
Uh...

23:54.320 --> 23:58.530
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.409
- We don't have bikes.
- At all.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.483
I was just trying to be nice.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.369
Looks like Jack here

24:04.520 --> 24:07.330
might be Mr Cuckoo Pants,
not you - right, Vanessa?

24:07.480 --> 24:09.209
That's fair.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.681
Doctor, you can see the outline
of your penis in those shorts.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.320
Baby, look.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.686
You are 100% right about that,
Vanessa.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.764
And I will change.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.321
And then we will
open up the hood

24:28.480 --> 24:31.131
and see what's gunkin' up
the works in there, OK?

24:31.320 --> 24:33.288
- How does that sound?
- Sounds good.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.091
Get out of there,
you crazy gremlins!

24:38.160 --> 24:40.686
Leave this nice lady alone!

24:40.840 --> 24:43.684
Don't worry, kid.
Mommy's not gonna be crazy forever.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.524
- OK.
- OK.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.401
There you go. Come on in.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.245
Hold on. I'll be right in, OK?
Sorry.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.165
- Hello?
- Jack, my main man!

24:55.320 --> 24:57.448
There are two police officers

24:57.640 --> 24:59.642
right here, right now,
in your home.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.644
And they seem really anxious
to speak to you.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.364
I didn't do anything.

25:05.560 --> 25:07.562
That's interesting
that you would say that.

25:07.720 --> 25:11.088
That sounds like a thing
a guilty person would say.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.767
Well, I didn't do anything, OK?
Innocent people say that too.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.082
I'm sure they do.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.328
Wait. How did they find you?

25:19.480 --> 25:21.369
Oh, long story.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.091
They knocked on the door
and then I answered it.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.605
At my house?

25:25.760 --> 25:28.081
I just popped in for a shower.
No big deal.

25:29.120 --> 25:34.331
Listen, F'resnel, just get rid
of the cops for now, OK? Please.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.209
They want to talk about
Mrs Nussbaum.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.806
Can we not talk about this
on the phone right now?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.485
Get rid of the cops.
I'm begging you.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.729
OK. Well, consider it done,
my white brother. Much love.

25:43.880 --> 25:48.329
You're a riot!

25:48.520 --> 25:50.204
Thank you so much, Doctor.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.961
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate it. Thanks.

25:55.800 --> 25:56.961
Whew!

25:58.000 --> 26:00.367
That was fast.
What did he say?

26:01.400 --> 26:02.970
That I'm 100% fine.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.766
I'm just stressed out
about the babies.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.207
He even wrote me a
prescription for valium.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.761
- Isn't it great?
- What?

26:10.960 --> 26:12.883
Yeah.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.690
Wait.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.247
He actually said "100% fine"?

26:17.400 --> 26:19.607
And then he wrote you
a prescription for valium

26:19.800 --> 26:23.088
even though you're eight months
pregnant with twins?

26:23.240 --> 26:24.651
Yep.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.688
Wow.
I'm just stunned, that's all.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.525
I almost don't believe it.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.409
Oh.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.767
Well, if you
don't believe me, then...

26:39.920 --> 26:43.163
...why don't you just ask him?

26:43.320 --> 26:46.529
Let me just talk to him real quick, OK?
I'll be right back.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.210
If you don't trust me
as the mother...

27:01.920 --> 27:04.685
I'm the mother of your unborn babies,
but no, no, no, no, no.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.569
I want you to go ask.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.485
- I'm sorry.
- No! I want you to ask him.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.484
I trust you. I trust you.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.768
I trust you. I do.

27:26.920 --> 27:30.367
I do. I'm sorry.
I just didn't trust him, you know?

27:30.520 --> 27:32.841
Come on.
Let's get you some valium, huh?

27:33.040 --> 27:35.088
Let's get you all valiumed up.
Alright?

27:35.240 --> 27:36.605
You're the best.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.882
Help me.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.681
Excuse me. Excuse me, Fathers?

27:52.840 --> 27:55.810
Excuse me. Hi.
I hate to be a pest, but...

27:55.960 --> 28:00.045
Louisiana has some pretty sticky
clean indoor air laws,

28:00.240 --> 28:03.050
and you guys are in major violation
of them right now.

28:03.240 --> 28:07.245
So if you wouldn't mind taking
the cigarettes out of doors...

28:12.560 --> 28:14.403
If we wrap this up in time,

28:14.560 --> 28:16.881
I kind of want to check out
the French Quarter, eh?

28:17.040 --> 28:20.965
Is this a place where
the girls flash their boobies?

28:21.120 --> 28:23.122
Is the Vieux Carré.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.011
It's the original city,
founded in 1718.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.403
It's 78 square blocks
that are all protected

28:29.600 --> 28:31.762
in national historic landmark.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.526
It's an area steeped
in the history

28:34.680 --> 28:37.729
of the Spanish and the French
and the Civil War.

28:38.760 --> 28:43.049
But it is also the place where
the girls flash their boobies?

28:43.240 --> 28:45.402
Si.

28:45.560 --> 28:49.121
College girls taking their
perky brand-new boobs out

28:49.280 --> 28:51.601
for a little victory lap.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.845
Sweat of their young bosom mixing with Jagermeister

28:56.040 --> 29:01.331
and the humidity of the bayou,
jiggling for fool's gold.

29:02.520 --> 29:06.002
Please, my friend, you had me
at "perky new boobs".

29:06.160 --> 29:07.047
Mmm.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.530
Oh! Fuck!

29:13.920 --> 29:15.888
I told you, let that thing be.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.529
Is that dog back again?

29:22.680 --> 29:25.889
I do not like that thing
creepin' around here.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.441
I think it's kind of cute.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.768
I'm gonna buy a gun.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.327
- This neighbourhood is nuts.
- Smart, Jack.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.960
Move to the ghetto and then
bring another gun in.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.884
You should have
your NPR tote bag taken away

29:43.040 --> 29:44.963
for comments like that.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.122
Morning, y'all.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.681
- Hi, F'resnel.
- How you doin'?

29:54.760 --> 29:57.843
Jack Watson?
Orleans Parish Police.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.846
Hi. Yeah. Yeah, I'm Jack Watson.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.764
I'm sorry.
Have I done anything wrong?

30:03.920 --> 30:08.608
You tell us, boy genius.
You tell us.

30:08.760 --> 30:12.560
You wouldn't know the whereabouts
of one Ms Elaine Nussbaum?

30:12.720 --> 30:15.644
About 90 years old, 5'9",
missing a couple of teeth?

30:15.800 --> 30:19.202
- Nope. No, I don't.
- Huh. Really?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.328
Has something happened to her?

30:21.480 --> 30:24.086
You tell us.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.164
- I...
- Is that a yes?

30:27.320 --> 30:29.527
- You tell us.
- Tell us.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.245
I don't know
anything about her.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.801
If you're gonna ask questions,
should we get a lawyer?

30:33.960 --> 30:38.249
If you're guilty, you absolutely should.
Absolutely.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.165
Don't say another word.
If you're guilty.

30:43.120 --> 30:47.921
So...are you?
Are you guilty, Shakespeare?

30:48.080 --> 30:51.482
Are you, Einstein? Huh?

30:51.640 --> 30:54.246
Let me ask you
a question, brainiac.

30:54.400 --> 30:58.689
What did you do
that makes you so nervous?

30:58.840 --> 31:00.444
What did you do, bookworm?

31:00.600 --> 31:02.329
Nothing!
I...

31:02.480 --> 31:05.006
I didn't do anything.

31:05.160 --> 31:08.084
Why don't you take a walk
with us, Casanova?

31:08.240 --> 31:11.323
Wait. I'm sorry, I'm confused.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.289
Am I still Casanova?

31:13.440 --> 31:15.283
Because up until now,
all the nicknames have been

31:15.440 --> 31:18.205
"smart guy"-related, and
that's more like "lover boy".

31:18.360 --> 31:21.887
I was trying to come up with
another smart guy and blanked.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.769
Should have said
"Stephen Hawking".

31:23.920 --> 31:25.763
So you...

31:25.920 --> 31:28.685
Why don't you take a walk
with us, Moliére?

31:30.400 --> 31:31.401
Nice.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.247
So...

31:38.400 --> 31:41.449
Haven't seen Ms Nussbaum in a while?

31:41.600 --> 31:44.206
I'm wondering
how you'd explain this.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.406
Oh, my God!

31:53.560 --> 31:56.882
She just wanted
to say thank you.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.441
Why does she want to say
thank you?

31:59.640 --> 32:02.120
According to her, she got lost
when she was sleepwalking,

32:02.280 --> 32:05.090
you found her, put her down for a nap,
and now she feels fine.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.368
I feel fine!

32:07.520 --> 32:09.568
She lives down at
the nursing home down the block.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.484
She gets out all the time.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.564
- Thought you checked her pulse.
- I did check her pulse!

32:14.720 --> 32:17.849
- Somebody wants a hug.
- No.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.163
It is our duty
to legally enforce that hug.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.482
I'm pretty sure
you can't legally enforce a hug.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.325
- Just suck it up.
- You have to do it.

32:26.480 --> 32:29.802
- Just hug the bitch, champ.
- Guys, listen, listen...

32:29.960 --> 32:33.328
I don't want to hug her, OK?
Please. She's old.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.802
Hey! That is someone's
great-g rand mother!

32:36.960 --> 32:40.521
Don't! OK. OK. OK.
I'll hug her. I'll hug her.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.688
I'm so glad you're OK,
Mrs Nussbaum.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.969
OK. Alright? Great.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.327
Great. OK. OK. Great.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.165
- OK. Guys?
- Act like a lady, Ms Nussbaum.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.567
OK, I need a little help.
She's really strong!

32:55.720 --> 32:57.802
- Act like a lady.
- Be a lady, Mrs Nussbaum.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.849
Knock that shit off,
Mrs Nussbaum!

33:00.000 --> 33:01.923
She's got her finger in my ass
and it hurts!

33:02.120 --> 33:04.168
Bad Grandma! No!

33:04.320 --> 33:06.971
- Oh! Oh!
- Jeez!

33:07.120 --> 33:08.531
- Arggh!
- Still got it.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.523
Her nails are so sharp.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.170
- You OK?
- I'm sorry about that.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.209
- That was gross.
- Is she alive?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.249
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
She'll be fine.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.927
The fucking city turned down the power
on these babies to save money.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.809
These things
couldn't kill anybody.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.246
Oh! Fuck! Shit! Ah!

33:23.400 --> 33:25.880
It's not a big thing.
You don't have to worry about it.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.929
Yeah, you don't have to
worry about it.

33:28.080 --> 33:31.562
Come on, Ron!
Shit, man! I got fillings.

33:31.720 --> 33:32.767
Fuck!

33:33.920 --> 33:38.687
Wow. If you don't need us
for anything else, we should...

33:38.840 --> 33:42.208
- Yeah, that's about it.
- Great. OK. Good.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.930
You know where to find us.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.690
Thanks for helping us
sort all this out.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.251
You're welcome.

33:47.400 --> 33:51.291
Still don't know why that old lady
was dazed and covered in dirt, but...

33:51.440 --> 33:53.522
Fuck it, right?

33:58.280 --> 34:03.047
Oh, my God!

34:05.000 --> 34:07.128
What just happened?

34:07.280 --> 34:09.931
- I thought she was dead.
- Me too.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.081
To living and learning.

34:12.239 --> 34:13.924
To living and learning.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.524
Ahh! Wow.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.567
I think we have to
kill those cops.

34:27.719 --> 34:31.690
- Yeah.
- Honey, they know way too much.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.366
I'm really tired, but I can't tell
if you're joking or not.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.761
I'm fine.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.804
- I didn't ask if you were fine.
- I'm fine.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.284
Need a new bottle.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.050
Can we just tone it down
a little bit with the booze?

35:03.240 --> 35:04.605
Hey.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.240
Judge Judy.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.165
Just everything
in moderation, OK?

35:10.320 --> 35:14.211
No more.
You win. No wine.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.607
I'm gonna go...

35:18.880 --> 35:21.281
I'm gonna go wash all this
old-lady vagina off me.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.324
Oh, my God. Oh!

35:46.120 --> 35:49.681
I'll be thinking about this guy
next time I'm fighting off a boner.

35:49.840 --> 35:53.003
Man! Check this out.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.924
Gross!

35:55.080 --> 35:56.889
Gross!

35:57.920 --> 35:59.046
Gross!

35:59.200 --> 36:01.771
- Eugh!
- Gross!

36:03.840 --> 36:05.763
Hey, Father. Thanks for
coming down so quickly.

36:05.920 --> 36:11.723
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.644
Peace be with you.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.087
Yikes.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.686
Our chief called you
as soon as he heard about this.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.127
We get some voodoo stuff
every now and then,

36:21.320 --> 36:23.049
but this just seemed
kind of more...

36:23.240 --> 36:25.368
- Biblical.
- Biblical.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.171
- Pretty weird.
- Super, super weird.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.163
- Scusi.
- Be our guest.

36:30.320 --> 36:33.210
Your crime scene.
Your crime scene.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.807
Wow. Get any readings off him?

36:47.960 --> 36:50.361
- We don't get readings.
- That's not us.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.643
That's the ghost hunters.
We don't do that.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.529
But is this
the work of the devil?

36:55.680 --> 36:57.569
This?
Off the record?

36:57.720 --> 37:00.610
Between you, me and
the crucified guy on the wall...

37:00.760 --> 37:03.286
I'd say that this is the work
of the devil.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.920
Or one of his very top guys.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.526
People, they think
that the devil is made-up,

37:08.680 --> 37:10.444
like Santa Claus.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.763
But I assure you,
the devil is real.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.769
And he's a dick.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.851
Well, all due respect, padres,
we still gotta check

37:22.000 --> 37:25.083
and see if there's a human
involved in this clambake.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.890
But we're open
to the devil thing too.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.771
Could be the devil.
Could be an ex-girlfriend on PCP.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.843
- No problem.
- You do your thing, we do ours.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.162
Not trying
to step on your toes.

37:34.320 --> 37:38.405
We'll call the coroner, get him
taken to the morgue, call it a day.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.449
"Hey, you guys new in town?
- Si.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.045
Ever have a Domilise's
po' boy?

37:42.200 --> 37:44.806
- Oh, po' boy.
- It's good.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.090
- Mm!
- Mm!

37:48.280 --> 37:49.930
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

37:50.120 --> 37:53.522
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh! Ow.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.762
Ooh, yeah. Yeah.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.642
I can't eat anymore.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.163
How did you two guys
become priests anyway?

38:49.320 --> 38:52.608
Yeah, you guys don't really
even seem that gay.

38:52.760 --> 38:56.367
My path to the priesthood
was, you know, the usual.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.370
I was up-and-coming bullfighter
in Madrid.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.925
- Wow.
- Shit.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.889
- That's awesome.
- What happened?

39:03.040 --> 39:05.042
What happened...

39:06.160 --> 39:10.529
...is that the bull
does not lose every bullfight.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.849
This bull was like
the Michael Jordan of bulls.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.729
He was amazing.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.281
He poked me through
like I was a custard flan.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.489
And he was...
And he was a...

39:22.880 --> 39:25.850
A bull. Exactly like that.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.684
The bad thing is,

39:27.880 --> 39:29.962
I could hear the parade
they threw for the bull.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.849
'Cause this bull
was very popular then.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.525
He's still popular now,

39:33.720 --> 39:35.802
for almost killing
such a promising young matador.

39:35.960 --> 39:39.043
So, what about you?
Were you a bullfighter too?

39:39.200 --> 39:41.680
I was one of those
living statue guys.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.525
Oh, yeah! Those weirdos
that paint themselves all white?

39:44.680 --> 39:46.569
You make a lot of tips.
Ladies love it.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.085
What happened?

39:48.280 --> 39:51.443
Bad luck.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.968
I got caught in the crossfire
of a local Mafia feud.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.844
They were trying to
shoot a couple

39:57.000 --> 39:58.729
who was testifying
against the family,

39:58.880 --> 40:01.326
and I don't know
if they no see me

40:01.480 --> 40:06.566
or they just think I'm a statue,
but I got shot 19 times.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.564
19 times seems excessive.

40:09.760 --> 40:13.526
They say it's still a record
in that part of Italy, huh?

40:13.720 --> 40:18.282
- Not bad.
- For Italy, that is something.

40:18.440 --> 40:19.965
Put that on your Facebook page.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.851
They take me back to
a local hospital.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.970
And there, the good sisters
save my life.

40:27.440 --> 40:30.728
They suck the 19 bullets
out of my body

40:30.880 --> 40:33.486
with their mouths.

40:43.760 --> 40:47.401
I guess the doctor
was not there that day.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.201
It was a good day.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.051
Describe that memory
for just another second.

41:21.200 --> 41:24.841
It was on that day I decided
to give my life to God.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.441
You're probably wondering
how we became partners.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.364
Let's tell the story.

41:32.520 --> 41:35.410
- I was new to the force.
- And I'm a bit of a renegade.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.887
- I think we get it.
- We get it.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.361
- You no get along...
- Then you do get along.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.244
Could I just tell
a little bit more?

41:46.440 --> 41:48.568
- It's OK. I get it.
- We get it.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.290
We listened to
your whole back story.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.926
- I'm sure it's fascinating.
- I know. You're cops.

41:53.080 --> 41:55.162
You don't get along,
then you do. We get it.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.044
It's actually much more
complicated than that.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.402
- That's OK.
- Hey!

41:59.560 --> 42:01.801
Have you guys ever been
to Bourbon Street?

42:22.080 --> 42:23.684
Hey.

43:41.360 --> 43:43.169
Ahhh!

43:47.000 --> 43:48.968
There you are, Sleeping Beauty.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.367
I'm going back to bed, sweetie.

43:52.560 --> 43:56.201
You've been asleep for 36 hours.
You feelin' OK?

43:56.400 --> 44:00.803
- How many valium did you take?
- Not that many.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.486
These little devils
are kicking me so hard.

44:03.640 --> 44:06.166
And scratching
like a motherfucker.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.049
Scratching?

44:09.840 --> 44:11.490
I don't think that's right.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.449
I think we should call
Dr Marsden.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.807
I'm fine!

44:16.880 --> 44:19.565
Oh. Don't forget.

44:19.760 --> 44:22.206
Marjorie wants to do the smudge
ceremony for the house, OK?

44:25.120 --> 44:27.361
OK.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.607
Hah. Mm. Rrr!

45:05.160 --> 45:06.810
Come on!

45:12.160 --> 45:14.003
Oh, dammit!

45:17.000 --> 45:18.889
Come on!

45:33.680 --> 45:35.364
- Jackie boy!
- Oh, my God!

45:35.520 --> 45:37.363
- Oh!
- Oh!

45:45.360 --> 45:47.442
Whoo!

45:47.600 --> 45:50.729
- Whoo!
- Ohhh.

45:50.880 --> 45:53.008
- Wow.
- Hell.

45:53.160 --> 45:56.846
My apologies. I must have
really given you a fright.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.241
Just lurkin' down here
in your crawl space

45:59.440 --> 46:01.966
like some terrifyin'
man-sized opossum.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.283
I'm sorry.
Holy mackerel, man.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.886
I'll tell you.
They're spooky, marsupials.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.849
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.729
Now's a good time

46:11.880 --> 46:13.689
to set some ground rules
about coming and going.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.649
Oh, you know what?
That reminds me.

46:15.800 --> 46:19.407
Has somebody removed a box
of vintage pornography?

46:19.560 --> 46:22.291
I had been looking after it, you see.

46:22.440 --> 46:25.364
And then I just came in,
it just wasn't there no more.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.284
It had moved in some
way, shape or form.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.522
- No.
- You have not seen it?

46:29.720 --> 46:32.041
- No, sorry.
- No? OK. Alright. OK.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.841
Well, if you happen to come by it,
I do consider it mine.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.809
- Alright.
- Before you get upset...

46:37.960 --> 46:39.644
I know what you're thinking.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.121
I don't want Fresnel
pleasurin' himself

46:42.280 --> 46:45.682
"in my crawl space
to vintage pornography."

46:45.840 --> 46:47.490
I get it.

46:47.640 --> 46:51.087
I hadn't yet formulated
that thought into words,

46:51.280 --> 46:53.681
but now you say it,
that's exactly what I was thinking.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.524
Know what, Jack?
Let me tell you something.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.091
It's just like
our boy Shakespeare says.

46:57.240 --> 46:58.605
"If we lovers have offended,

46:58.760 --> 47:00.171
"think but this
and all is mended."

47:00.320 --> 47:02.084
I hate 'Midsummer...'

47:02.240 --> 47:04.129
I wanted to ask you
about Mrs Nussbaum

47:04.280 --> 47:06.408
and how she was
all covered up in that dirt,

47:06.560 --> 47:08.050
and then asking after you,

47:08.200 --> 47:10.362
and then the police comin'
and questionin' you.

47:10.520 --> 47:12.249
I mean...

47:12.400 --> 47:14.289
What was that all about?

47:14.440 --> 47:16.647
That was just
a stupid misunderstanding.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.962
- Oh! OK, OK.
- Yeah.

47:19.120 --> 47:21.327
So it wasn't like you thought
you had murdered her

47:21.520 --> 47:23.124
and you were actually
buryin' her alive?

47:26.480 --> 47:28.164
What? No.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.044
No? OK.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.526
- No.
- What?!

47:31.680 --> 47:33.569
No, I-I-I... I...

47:33.720 --> 47:36.246
Well, I... F...

47:37.280 --> 47:39.647
<i>J... J...</i>

47:39.800 --> 47:42.087
No, may I ask what gave you

47:42.240 --> 47:44.163
that very specific
and detailed impression?

47:44.320 --> 47:46.004
Oh, well, you know...

47:46.160 --> 47:48.128
You know, Jack...

47:48.280 --> 47:50.886
Sometimes I see things.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.202
I see lots of detailed things.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.287
We have a friendly
relationship, right?

47:59.520 --> 48:01.090
Of course, F'resnel.

48:01.240 --> 48:05.165
So let's not worry about
my comings and goings

48:05.360 --> 48:07.442
and worry about
our friendship.

48:07.600 --> 48:11.082
Like when one of us sees the
other friend murder a person

48:11.280 --> 48:14.489
and dispose of the body,
then we just let it slide.

48:14.640 --> 48:18.929
Even if it's a half-murder,
like with you and Mrs Nussbaum.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.043
What do you say?

48:21.200 --> 48:22.929
Huh?

48:23.080 --> 48:24.969
What do you think about that?

48:29.080 --> 48:30.445
Of course.

48:30.600 --> 48:34.161
- Hey, let me ask you something.
- Mm-hm.

48:34.320 --> 48:36.721
Have you seen a big, scary dog
around here?

48:36.880 --> 48:38.405
OK, now, Jack,

48:38.600 --> 48:41.410
I'm sorry,
that dog is as exactly alive

48:41.600 --> 48:43.523
as Mrs Nussbaum is dead.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.444
Dog is a...

48:45.600 --> 48:48.001
- I'm sorry, I can't do the math.
- It's a ghost dog.

48:48.160 --> 48:50.288
That's a straight-up ghost dog.

48:50.440 --> 48:52.761
Yeah. People been
seein' the dog and whatnot.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.809
And I don't believe in it.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.849
When you see a big-ass dog
runnin' around,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.002
there's something else that
you see - you know that is?

48:59.200 --> 49:01.407
- No, what?
- Dog poop.

49:01.560 --> 49:03.403
- Dog...?
- Dog poop!

49:03.560 --> 49:05.289
When you got a dog
runnin' around,

49:05.440 --> 49:07.408
there'll be big old piles
of dog poop everywhere.

49:07.560 --> 49:10.325
And I have been here
for 15 years,

49:10.480 --> 49:12.528
I ain't never, never seen
no one pile.

49:12.680 --> 49:15.047
- 15 years, no...
- No poop.

49:15.200 --> 49:18.363
Not a single bit.
That's just a phantom dog, OK?

49:18.520 --> 49:21.126
He's probably a spectre
from the beyond, OK?

49:21.280 --> 49:22.964
He's probably some kind of
devil's minion

49:23.120 --> 49:25.964
who has taken a form
that he knows will scare us.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.566
This is food for thought
for you right now.

49:28.720 --> 49:32.611
Ghosts don't kill people.

49:33.920 --> 49:35.763
People kill people.

49:35.920 --> 49:38.321
And occasionally,
you'll have a person

49:38.480 --> 49:41.609
who's under the evil power of a ghost
who will kill somebody.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.728
But I've gotta tell you
somethin' right now.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.850
This house, I think it's got
its best days ahead of it.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.328
- Thanks, F'resnel.
- You're welcome, brother.

49:50.480 --> 49:53.404
I think...
I need to get a po' boy.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.210
Are you game?

49:55.360 --> 49:56.930
Oh, no, no, no.
I shouldn't.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.570
You know what? Fuck it!

49:58.760 --> 50:00.524
- Mm!
- Mm. Wow.

50:01.880 --> 50:02.961
- Wow.
- Mm-hm?

50:03.120 --> 50:05.122
- Wow!
- Mm! Hot-diggity.

50:05.280 --> 50:06.441
- Whoo!
- Mm-hm.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.090
Wow!

50:09.120 --> 50:11.441
- There it is.
- Brrr!

50:11.600 --> 50:13.887
- Mm-hm.
- Wow!

50:15.960 --> 50:17.371
Ahhh!

50:17.520 --> 50:19.522
Two more shrimp po' boys!

50:28.720 --> 50:30.768
Fuck!

51:02.400 --> 51:04.607
- Arggh!
- Arggh!

51:04.760 --> 51:06.728
Arggh! Arggh!

51:06.880 --> 51:08.530
Oh! Oh!

51:08.680 --> 51:11.490
I AM SO SICK OF BEING STARTLED!

51:39.400 --> 51:42.006
- Mrs Nussbaum?
- No, silly, it's me!

52:09.680 --> 52:12.763
I hope there's some hot water
left over

52:12.920 --> 52:15.810
for ze little monsieur.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.205
- Arggh!
- Oh, my God!

52:18.400 --> 52:20.323
Marjorie!

52:20.480 --> 52:23.689
Why is my wife's sister
in my shower?

52:23.840 --> 52:26.605
I got to set some ground rules
around here, starting right now.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.489
I said it was me. Jeez.

52:28.640 --> 52:30.210
Wait, the little monsieur?
Really?

52:30.360 --> 52:32.886
No! You have to know
the context.

52:33.080 --> 52:34.650
Wait a minute.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.882
I didn't know
you were circumcised, Jack.

52:37.040 --> 52:39.725
Really? We never covered that
at Thanksgiving?

52:39.920 --> 52:41.490
It's genital mutilation,
you know.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.244
Slicing off the tops
of boys' dicks because

52:43.400 --> 52:45.164
a couple-of-thousand-year-old
book

52:45.320 --> 52:47.288
about a medicine man
named Moses says to do it?

52:47.440 --> 52:49.761
- That's religion for you.
- Ha!

52:49.920 --> 52:54.562
OK. Well, um...
Let's talk about something else.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.961
When did you leave
the reservation?

52:57.120 --> 52:59.885
You have a pretty nice dick,
Jack.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.644
Thank you?

53:01.800 --> 53:03.529
You know I don't believe
in marriage,

53:03.680 --> 53:05.409
which is basically
institutionalised slavery

53:05.560 --> 53:07.483
and the subjugation of women.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.369
I've never heard you
say that before.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.763
Just because you're married to my sister
doesn't mean you own her.

53:12.920 --> 53:17.289
So, what were we talking about
before the dick thing?

53:17.440 --> 53:20.205
Uh, yeah. When did you leave
the reservation?

53:20.360 --> 53:23.648
Last week - I moved to
a cooperative farm in Baton Rouge.

53:23.840 --> 53:25.490
- Yuck.
- It's pretty cool. Here.

53:25.680 --> 53:27.887
Help a sister out
and get my back, will you?

53:28.040 --> 53:30.281
- I...
- Thank you.

53:36.040 --> 53:39.362
- Oh, that smells awful.
- It does not.

53:39.520 --> 53:41.727
It's all-natural
organic quinoa flax lotion

53:41.880 --> 53:43.848
with kelp and
octopus placenta.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.322
- Octopus placenta.
- Oh, such strong hands!

53:47.480 --> 53:50.609
My sister's got
such good taste.

53:50.760 --> 53:53.161
Oh, yeah.

53:53.320 --> 53:55.607
I'm a fucking idiot
with guys.

53:55.760 --> 53:57.330
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

53:57.480 --> 53:58.891
Curly Bear left me.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.929
He embarrassed me
in front of the whole tribe.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.650
I doubt it.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.446
He stole my Subaru Outback,
credit cards and banjo.

54:05.600 --> 54:07.204
And my MacBook Pro.

54:07.360 --> 54:11.206
- I bet you called the cops.
- No, of course not.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.523
If anything, I should be
thanking Curly Bear.

54:14.680 --> 54:17.490
You know, I was so wrapped up
in material BS

54:17.640 --> 54:19.244
that I was missing the moment.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.841
Yeah, I know that banjo
was totally holding you back.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.206
Yeah.

54:23.400 --> 54:25.323
- Spin. I'll do you now.
- No.

54:28.040 --> 54:31.442
Trust me - this stuff is like your skin
never breathed before,

54:31.600 --> 54:33.204
like it's been suffocating
until today.

54:33.360 --> 54:35.408
Skin doesn't breathe.
You ever heard that?

54:35.560 --> 54:37.403
- It's impossible.
- Sure, Jack.

54:37.560 --> 54:40.245
Ohhh.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.609
It's not sexual, Jack.
It's just people.

54:43.800 --> 54:47.850
Awesome! Well, thank you
for the octopus placenta.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.729
- You're welcome.
- And that conversation.

54:49.880 --> 54:52.884
And I am gonna go
anywhere else,

54:53.040 --> 54:55.008
because I've got a ton to do,

54:55.160 --> 54:57.891
and this is
wildly inappropriate.

54:58.040 --> 55:00.646
- You have an erection, Jack.
- Yeah. I get 'em.

55:00.800 --> 55:03.406
It's nothing to be embarrassed by.
It's totally natural.

55:03.560 --> 55:05.722
If anything, I think
it should be celebrated.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.928
That's what a maypole
symbolises, of course.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.605
Of course.

55:09.760 --> 55:11.842
- Hey!
- Oh! Wow!

55:12.000 --> 55:13.809
It's like Grand Central Station
in here!

55:13.960 --> 55:15.962
- Hi!
- You must be Marjorie.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.242
Nice to meet you.
I am F'resnel.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.801
I'm very sorry to hear about
Curly Bear.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.964
Pfff!

55:27.120 --> 55:28.007
Thank you.

55:28.160 --> 55:31.369
Ai-baba!

55:31.520 --> 55:33.887
We call on you,
Ogou Fe.

55:34.040 --> 55:37.726
We thank you for cleaning
this house of evil.

55:37.880 --> 55:42.010
We thank Jack for
opening his doors and his heart.

55:42.160 --> 55:45.448
We thank F'resnel for bearing
witness to the ceremony.

55:45.600 --> 55:49.685
We thank this guy for...

55:50.720 --> 55:53.530
I'm just here to install
the cable internet.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.603
Sorry, the circles
aren't even established,

55:55.760 --> 55:57.524
so if you'll bear with us
a few minutes.

55:57.680 --> 55:59.170
Cool.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.684
So sorry
you got roped into this.

56:02.840 --> 56:04.763
Wait. Where's my sister?

56:04.960 --> 56:06.644
She's lying down.
She's not feeling well.

56:06.840 --> 56:08.251
You should have insisted!

56:08.400 --> 56:10.880
I did. And she did this.

56:12.560 --> 56:14.642
- Goddamn! Goddamn!
- Oh, dear.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.326
That could get infected.
You might want some Bactine...

56:17.480 --> 56:20.006
Thank you! I put some
fucking Bactine on it!

56:20.160 --> 56:22.242
- Whoa, Jack.
- I'm sorry.

56:22.440 --> 56:26.525
It's just that this house has had
a strange effect on my wife,

56:26.680 --> 56:28.967
and I think she might be
possessed by a demon,

56:29.120 --> 56:30.690
so I'm a little stressed out.

56:30.840 --> 56:32.683
This is an evil house,

56:32.840 --> 56:35.002
so we're doin' this little
gris-gris ceremony.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.565
And not a day too soon neither.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.290
It's actually
a Haitian ceremony.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.442
It cleans the space
of bad spirits.

56:40.600 --> 56:42.329
Cool! Very cool.

56:42.480 --> 56:45.006
Again, just here for
the cable internet.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.604
- Is there marijuana in there?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

57:13.760 --> 57:15.524
Is that what usually
goes in there?

57:15.680 --> 57:19.207
No, it's usually just tobacco,
but tobacco is so bad for you.

57:19.360 --> 57:22.409
Is it just me, y'all,
or is this some...

57:24.880 --> 57:27.247
...very, very...

57:28.760 --> 57:30.728
...very strong marijuana?

57:30.920 --> 57:33.571
- We grow it on the reservation.
- Do you, now?

57:33.760 --> 57:35.762
- Yeah.
- Good for you, baby.

57:50.920 --> 57:53.924
My hands are like the Hulk.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.809
You know the Incredible Hulk?

57:55.960 --> 57:58.884
They're, like, regular-size?
They feel like Hulk hands.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.769
Oh!

58:00.920 --> 58:04.208
Like I could just punch
a crater into the ground.

58:04.360 --> 58:06.283
I think I should go
to the hospital.

58:06.440 --> 58:08.966
I also have to go to the hospital.
The other me.

58:09.120 --> 58:12.408
He has to go to the hospital.
I can get down there to him.

58:12.560 --> 58:16.087
Shh. Just ride it out.
It's like surfing a wave.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.163
It seems too big at first,

58:18.320 --> 58:21.085
and then soon,
you're coasting into the beach

58:21.240 --> 58:23.083
and the view is fantastic.

58:23.240 --> 58:25.607
You guys, it's so beautiful!

58:25.760 --> 58:29.526
It's not a different me.
It's me from a different time!

58:40.400 --> 58:42.243
Ohhhh!

58:46.160 --> 58:51.007
Ee pacho! Ee home! Be clean!

58:52.880 --> 58:55.326
And now this place is clean.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.564
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

58:59.760 --> 59:02.047
- It's an earthquake!
- Go to the doorway!

59:02.200 --> 59:06.091
That is a myth! Get next to
a large piece of furniture!

59:06.240 --> 59:08.686
Run outside!

59:25.120 --> 59:27.521
Well, that is incredibly odd.

59:32.160 --> 59:35.130
Whoa! The earthquake
is only inside the house!

59:35.280 --> 59:36.964
Everybody out!

59:40.000 --> 59:43.891
Goddammit! What...?

59:46.200 --> 59:48.202
Hey!

59:48.360 --> 59:49.964
You guys bought
the 'House of Blood', huh?

59:50.120 --> 59:51.531
Yeah.

59:51.680 --> 59:53.967
Mind if I ask
what you got it for?

59:55.000 --> 59:56.650
320.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.211
Oh.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.482
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.962
- Hi. Hi.
- What's happen...

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.128
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.443
There's an earthquake,
but it's only inside.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.045
It's not outside.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.009
I say we just go
and wait it out.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.845
I'm probably just gonna go,
if that's OK with you guys.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.207
- Yeah, OK.
- Could you sign this?

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.330
Saying you're satisfied with
my installation of cable internet?

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.881
- OK.
- Just initial that.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.247
- Great.
- Alright. Great.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.402
Are you sure
you're OK to drive?

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:36.767
Well, I am very, very high,
so...let's find out.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.490
OK.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.207
We have to get out
of this house tonight.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.124
This is like in the movies

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.123
when insane shit happens
and they still don't leave.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.203
No.
Do not be rash.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.482
You always do this.
This is our home.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.369
Something obviously thinks
that it's its home.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.124
It's trying to scare
the shit out of us!

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.049
You're screaming at me
and I like it here!

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.450
- Well, I don't like it here!
- Hey, everybody, calm down.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.570
Listen, you lovebirds.
Don't fight right now, OK?

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.484
We'll talk this all over

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.884
over one of F'resnel's
famous pizza salads!

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.008
Ha-ha! Alright.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.005
Mm!

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.801
Uh-huh. What did I tell you?

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.361
When you said "pizza salad"...

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.965
...I was kind of sceptical,
F'resnel.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.685
I thought you were gonna
throw pizza slices in a bowl of salad.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.287
That's very much what I did do.
Precisely, in fact.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.330
That's why we call it pizza salad.
Know what I'm sayin'?

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.528
You just take a Domino's pizza,

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.844
you toss it in a bowl with some salad,
also from Domino's.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.930
Well, I think this is
a perfect time to bring up

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.765
some of the weird stuff
that's been going on in the house.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.644
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.640
Namely Marjorie's
'smudge' ceremony.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.640
Think it may have awoken
something really big.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.280
- Thank you!
- Not a c...

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.289
Or 'someone' could have hit our gas line
while digging in the backyard.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.245
- That could also explain it.
- Actually...

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.520
I don't think
that explains it, Vanessa.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.729
There is nothing wrong
with this house.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.006
OK.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.770
Old houses settle.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.289
That was...
way beyond settling!

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.522
Way beyond settling!

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.083
I know carpentry.
That was not settling, Bob Vila! OK?

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.562
That was a three-minute-long
massive shock wave

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.162
that would register at 6 or 7
on a Richter scale.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.521
You are packing your kimono
and we are going to a motel tonight!

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.689
- Are you Jack Watson?
- Yeah.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.526
Yeah. I mean,
we met here two days ago.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.604
- Right here.
- Oh. Did we, Mozart?

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.569
Did we meet two days ago?

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.770
Don't be a dick...Renzo Piano,
the famous architect.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.009
- Your fat wife around?
- My wife's pregnant with twins.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.889
Yeah
right!

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.963
- Heard that before.
- Where's she at?

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.441
In the kitchen eating pizza salad
with my sister-in-law

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.523
and my black friend
and neighbour, F'resnel.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.041
You don't have to be
that specific with us, sir!

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.770
Mind if we ask her
a couple questions?

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.684
Could I say no?

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.683
Yeah, but then we
come back with a warrant

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.640
and you better be lawyered up,
Gregory Hines.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.802
The dancer guy?

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.923
- I don't know why I said that.
- I don't either.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.611
Folks, we need you to look at
some photographs,

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.889
but I will warn you,
they are a little bit graphic.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.408
- Oh, God.
- um

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.089
Oh, heavens. I apologise.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.844
Yeah, they're graphic.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.804
- Jack?
- Honey...

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.043
Oh, no. I'm not gonna puke.
I mean... Not a puker.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.530
Oh, God, F'resnel.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.770
It's OK.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.769
Very natural.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.888
- Oh, God.
- They're very gruesome.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.923
Very gruesome pictures.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.201
It's OK.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.890
Oh, God!

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.725
- OK.
- OK.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.287
Perhaps we could continue
this conversation

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.525
in the living room,
which has less vomit in it.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.562
Mm-hm.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.884
This is Dr Michael Marshall.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.687
Or, at least, it was.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.491
- 'Cause he's dead!
- Oh, my God!

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.369
His records indicate

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.524
that you were the last person
to see him, Ms Watson.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.606
He wrote down when he died?
That's pretty weird, isn't it?

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.762
"That's pretty weird, isn't it?"

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.406
Fuck you.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.962
Hers was the last appointment
on his books.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.045
Now, we're not saying that
you did anything, obviously.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.682
We just want to know
if you saw anything,

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.606
heard anything...unusual -
that's all.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.922
No, I...

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.128
God...

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.084
I can't believe
this kind of thing can happen

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.203
in this day and age.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.169
Hey.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.004
What's with the blood
on your shirt?

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.567
- Oh.
- Yeah, gosh.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.609
I should have
taken care of this.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.889
I scratched myself earlier,
and, um...

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.570
What'd you scratch yourself on?
A grizzly bear?

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.200
The question remains.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:33.405
Did you...see anything...
unusual?

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.722
I told you, no.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.370
Neither of you saw anything
out of the ordinary?

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.050
That's good.
Alright, thank you, guys.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.009
Thank you very much
for your time.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.482
- No further questions from us.
- We appreciate your patience.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.008
We will be in touch.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.844
Have a good day.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.928
Well, they're hidin' something.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.811
While you were talking,
we did a full sweep of the house.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.167
We searched the place,
and we feel

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.120
there is something very unholy
about this house.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.930
- Si.
- I can tell you this.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.048
That fat girl,
she doesn't know a thing.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.330
The woman, does she look
anything...like this?

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.881
Whoa! Yeah.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.769
Great skates!

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.809
She looks a lot like that.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.725
We take these pictures
in the house three minutes ago.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.326
What the shit?

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:37.962
You took these in the house
three minutes ago?

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.327
How'd you print 'em out
so quick?

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.089
Holy cow!
That's a small printer.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.844
Tiny printer, right?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.809
It's not about the size,
it's about the quality!

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.404
I'm impressed!

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.728
Printer technology move forward
these days, leaps and bounds.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.211
It's adorable.

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:56.809
This is the same tiny printer
that is endorsed by Ashton Kookener.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.531
Ashton Kushner, he say,
"Only one printer I use..."

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.728
- That one!
- Well, he's cool.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.724
And if he's usin' it, by de facto,
I'm kind of cool, right?

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.609
I like all of the movies

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.161
where Ashton Kushner
get married by accident

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:11.720
then wake up and, "Oh!"

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.486
And the judge goes,
"I sentence you to marriage."

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.609
- "You can't do this!"
- I love this.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.889
- "You cannot do this!"
- 'Cause marriage is a sentence.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.609
What were we saying?

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.211
With the hell hound,

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.011
with the crucifixion
in the doctor's office,

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.721
we feel it is very possible
we have demonic possession.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.359
I don't know, guys.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.801
They're actually super-sweet,
and the woman, I mean,

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.769
she's, like,
meggo-preggo...

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.968
So I don't know.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.282
She is preggo?

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.801
Jeepers.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.203
How far along is she?

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:53.331
Well, guys, we're not doctors,
but she's pretty far along.

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:55.244
She's ready to drop.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.886
Look, we'd love
to help you out, but, I mean,

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.281
just because you think
someone's possessed,

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.011
we have pictures of a ghost dog

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.128
and a gruesome
crucifixion murder,

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.089
none of these things
really connect.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.810
If they did it,
they'll slip up,

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.440
and when they do,
we'll be here.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.483
We got everything
under control.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.568
- Jeez!
- What the hell...

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.845
Oh! Oh, it's just a crow.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.482
- It's just a crow.
- It's just a dead crow.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.040
It's a harpy.
See for yourself, huh?

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.165
- You guys get a lot of these?
- You'd be surprised.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.845
Kinda, yeah.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.331
What does it mean?

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.847
The harpy? It's a harbinger.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.490
Of evil.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.808
It is a message from hell.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:57.285
Trust me, things are about
to get very, very bad.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.003
Gee whiz. I am so sorry.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.801
There was a bumblebee in the car,
and I just lost control...

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.526
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck!

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.882
Well...what should we do now?

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.530
Now we wait.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.963
Now...we wait.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.924
- We need a doctor.
- No.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.924
We need a priest.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.883
Guys! Guys. Guys!

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.764
Yaaa!

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.730
Have no fear, sir.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.450
Who are you guys?

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.762
We are...team four.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.730
Why did you
let them impale me with that umbrella?

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.281
Do not listen to him!
He is the father of lies!

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.367
Ar

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.761
You guys got this?
Everybody cool?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.684
Oh, God!
Here they come!

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.490
- This is some shit!
- Somebody help me!

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.404
The babies are coming!

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.404
Breathe, Vanessa!
Breathe, Vanessa, breathe!

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.289
It hurts so bad!

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.363
Remember what they
taught us in class!

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.967
- I can see it! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.724
Ar

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:41.963
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.531
- What is it?
- Oh!

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.247
It's a boy.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.890
It's a perfect baby boy.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.247
Congratulations.
- It's a miracle.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.762
You ever seen a home birth before?
They're the best.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.522
- Honey! Honey!
- Just one more to go!

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.808
You guys, something's wrong!

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.203
It hurts so bad, this one.
Something's wrong! It's...

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.727
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.611
It's biting me!
Arggh!

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.446
- Focus.Focus.
- Alright.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.967
Push! Push!

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.042
Arggh!

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.011
Holy fucking shit!

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.685
Oh, faaaa...

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.007
Arggh!

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.290
No, Jack!

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.649
You must kill it, Jack,
you must!

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.569
- He's my son!
- He's not your son!

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.764
He wants to rise and rule the world
for a thousand years!

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.611
Oh, shit!

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.004
- Hey, guys.
- Shh!

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.408
Alright, y'all, I'm goin' in.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.682
Hello, devil baby!

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.801
Ain't nobody out here
tryin' to hurt you.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.846
Everything's gonna be OK,
little devil baby.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.007
Arggh!

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.286
Fuck!

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.920
I stubbed my goddamn toe!

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.003
Oh, that smarts!

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.322
I did the same thing
in there yesterday.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.050
- Hey, everybody.
- What?

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.362
I'm comin' back with the baby!

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.682
OK, here we go.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.128
OK. It's gonna
be alright now.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.250
Fuck this!

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.689
Ar

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.046
- You guys be careful!
- Whoa, sorry.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.321
Oh, no!

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.329
Ar

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.610
- I got a shot! I got a shot!
- No, you'll shoot one of us!

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.969
- He's a great shot! Take it!
- Be careful!

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.884
Being careful
don't kill devil babies.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.327
Noooooo!

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.130
Shit!

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.289
No! No! No! No! No! Please!

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.930
Ar

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.483
You! Are! Not! My! Baby!

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.449
That's the spirit, Vanessa!
Punch this devil baby!

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.125
Punch him back to hell!

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.687
I hate you!
You're not my baby.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.568
Don't listen
to his crocodile tears.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.131
Mama.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.328
You want Mommy
to hold you? Come...

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.211
It's OK. It's OK.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.890
Ah! No, no, no!

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.124
Vanessa! Let go of my sister!

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.723
- Little baby!
- Kill it!

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.928
Let's drown it!
Do you have a woodchipper?

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.970
Not to tell y'all how to parent,
but should we

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.600
let your good baby watch us
murdering the devil baby?

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.922
It might have a lasting impression
psychologically.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.162
Right. Good point.
Get the good baby out of here.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.771
Go, go, go!

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.410
- Marjorie?
- What?

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.564
I ain't known you that long,
but I'm 100% in love

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:58.007
and want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.089
Me too!

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.290
Just do me a favour
and stay alive.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.090
I will.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.005
The spirit gods
will protect me!

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.486
- Oh, shit!
- Arggh!

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.646
Marjorie?
No!

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.885
Oh! Oh!

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.606
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH!

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.649
What can I do?
What can I do?

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.087
Use the Jesus knife!
Kill that motherfucker!

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.363
Demonic child, I send you back
to the depths of hell

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.761
from whence you came!

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.322
- Arggh! Fuck this! Fuck!
- Let me hold him down!

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.850
Ah!

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.769
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:57.841
Oh!

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.925
Ar

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.684
Oh! Oh, no! Ah! Oh!

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.085
Not going to make it.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.090
Do it, my friend.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.528
I meant...not going to make it,

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.331
so call an ambulance, please.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.767
Why you do the pause
in the middle of the first part

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.649
of the important part?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.407
No! Devil! Babies!

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.564
In! My! Parish!

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.808
Ar

01:22:58.800 --> 01:22:59.961
Oh, my God.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.126
- I have an idea! Catch!
- What?

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.121
No! Jack! Where are you going?

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.682
You must fight! You are
the only one that can stop him!

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.969
Get off my wife, you asshole.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.565
NOW!

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.610
Thank you, F'resnel.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.649
My pleasure.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.320
Thank you, Father.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.164
Just doing our job.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.881
But the...the other priest...

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.530
We're...we're so sorry.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.688
It's OK.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:51.561
He always know one day
the Lord would call his name.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.882
But he was your friend.
And I'm really sorry.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.407
Huge bummer.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.086
Knowing him,
he would rather die this way,

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.489
fighting the devil, than on
a golf course or something.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.927
- That's the spirit.
- I like that.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.011
Wow!

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:13.722
Look who found a bike!
Alright, Mrs Nussbaum!

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.325
That's terrific.

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.209
- Wow.
- Just terrific.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.886
What a crazy week, huh?

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.362
- I was possessed by the devil!
- I know! You were such a bitch.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.204
Always freak you out
a little bit.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.089
I can't believe it started

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.368
with white people movin'
into the neighbourhood.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.608
- That's crazy enough.
- Only up from there.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:36.048
We were already at a seven,
you know? That's crazy.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.523
I love the way
black people speak.

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:43.241
So I guess everything's
wrapped up, huh?

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.482
All sewn up
like a little present.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:49.167
What about that dirty magazine
with your picture in it from the '70s?

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.243
- What's going on with all that?
- Honey!

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.041
My mother did porno
in the '70s. I told you that.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.441
- I knew that.
- Just for a year and a half.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.886
She paid her way
through college.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.610
Look at this guy!

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.088
- Look at this!
- Hell, no!

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:07.369
- I thought you were a phantom.
- I thought so too!

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.966
That's just a big dog that want
a whole lot of love.

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.168
That dog's licking
your sister's blood.

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.526
Ohhh!

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.967
- That's creepy.
- No. That's a bad...

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.851
- No, baby.
- Get out of here. Bye-bye.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.844
- Hey, baby.
- So...

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.447
- What?
- What do we do now?

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.409
Now we live, Jack.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:34.122
Now we go on about
that crazy little thing called livin'.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.089
Let's not waste another moment.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.607
Not another moment wasted.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.048
That's not another moment.
Our lives begin today.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.090
- Father...
- Si?

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.084
- What's your name?
- Sebastian.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:52.005
Then that's what
we'll call our son.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.164
- Oh, my goodness.
- Sebastian.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.290
That is really lovely.
That's so sweet.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.767
Sebastian F'resnel.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.046
Watson.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.085
That's beautiful.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.601
We wouldn't have this baby
if it weren't for both of you.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.250
That part's true.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.370
We'll put Sebastian F'resnel
at the top of our list, because...

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.091
Baby, there's no other list.
That's it.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.686
There is a list.
We've got a book that we've...

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:26.405
It's just that it's the nicest thing
that any white person...

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.841
...has ever done for me.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.411
'Cause walkin'
the street sometimes,

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:34.325
you don't even get
as much as a hello.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.164
- F'resnel...
- And y'all just...

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.243
Hello.

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.605
Jack, look me in the eye.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.967
Cool. Well, you're welcome.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.761
- We'll talk about it.
- That is really somethin' else.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.649
Remember at times like these,

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.201
you should see the glass
as half full.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.362
You have this beautiful baby.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.729
Do not think about the little baby
who you kill upstairs.

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:02.488
If you excuse me,
I got to go bury my friend.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.405
And then I gotta go
return the rental car.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.961
- Don't be late doin' that.
- Good luck.

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.088
- Peace be with you.
- Thank you, Father.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:14.647
Hey.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.522
It's a brand-new day,
the sun is shinin' in New Orleans,

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.207
and everything is just
lookin' on up from here.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.129
I gotta tell you, man,
for a minute there,

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.846
I didn't think I'd make it
through all that devilishness.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.883
Whoa! Looky here!

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.805
Dog poop!
That's dog poop!

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.485
Dog poop!

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:38.644
Hot damn! Are you kiddin' me?
And I almost stepped in it.

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.290
Must be my lucky day.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.408
Ar

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.324
Fuck!

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.246
Oh! Oh!
Did I just hit your friend?

01:28:49.305 --> 01:28:55.799
