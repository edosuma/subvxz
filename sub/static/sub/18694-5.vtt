00:13.111 --> 00:14.243
Hey!

00:14.278 --> 00:16.912
Hey, you!
You, right there!

00:16.948 --> 00:18.848
You kids got to stop
stealing that sign.

00:18.883 --> 00:20.683
Hey, hey!
Get back here.

00:20.718 --> 00:22.651
It's a lost cause, kid!

00:22.687 --> 00:24.153
Drop the sign!

00:26.390 --> 00:28.023
No, no, no, no.

00:28.059 --> 00:29.670
Where you going now?
Where you going, huh?

00:29.694 --> 00:31.260
Yeah, I got you.

00:32.864 --> 00:34.797
I got you now.

00:34.832 --> 00:36.932
Stop right-- whoa, whoa.

00:41.672 --> 00:44.006
Whoa.
See you.

00:44.041 --> 00:46.275
Damn it, get back here!

00:46.310 --> 00:47.610
Ah, hell.

00:47.645 --> 00:49.612
Yeah, it's Adams.

00:49.647 --> 00:50.353
I need backup.

00:50.377 --> 00:51.314
What is your location?

00:51.315 --> 00:53.549
Yeah, I'm at Tenth and...

00:55.586 --> 00:56.952
Well, it's a lot

00:56.988 --> 00:58.521
at the corner of Tenth and...

00:59.824 --> 01:01.357
I'm at Tenth and Boner,
all right?

01:08.399 --> 01:10.377
It's pretty juvenile, if you ask
me, I mean, the street is named

01:10.401 --> 01:11.867
for a prominent old family.

01:11.903 --> 01:13.068
I disagree.

01:13.104 --> 01:15.838
The word "boner"
is objectively...

01:15.873 --> 01:17.673
hilarious.

01:17.708 --> 01:21.744
The human penis has no
skeletal material of any kind.

01:21.779 --> 01:23.479
Wow, you really are
overthinking this.

01:23.514 --> 01:25.058
I mean, the kids, they
steal street signs

01:25.082 --> 01:26.782
that sound like
dirty words, okay?

01:26.818 --> 01:29.318
Like Wanger Street
or Morning Wood Way.

01:29.353 --> 01:32.795
There's nothing humorous about
nocturnal penile tumescence.

01:32.819 --> 01:33.056
What?

01:33.057 --> 01:35.391
It's a natural phenomenon,

01:35.426 --> 01:37.393
as you well know.
But...

01:37.428 --> 01:39.061
"Boner Street"?

01:39.096 --> 01:40.496
Right. That's great.

01:40.531 --> 01:42.198
Why don't I just put on
some entertainment

01:42.233 --> 01:43.732
for someone over
the age of eight?

01:45.203 --> 01:47.536
Kathy arrived at Quantico,

01:47.572 --> 01:48.938
but found her lecture hall
empty.

01:48.973 --> 01:51.740
"Where is everyone?"

01:51.776 --> 01:52.708
she asked herself.

01:52.743 --> 01:53.876
Wh-What is this?

01:53.911 --> 01:55.377
What, you don't
recognize it?

01:55.413 --> 01:57.479
It's your latest
novel on audiobook.

01:57.515 --> 02:00.683
"I'll need to see the director
at once," Kathy said.

02:00.718 --> 02:02.084
This is terrible.

02:02.119 --> 02:03.586
The narrator.
The narrator?

02:03.621 --> 02:04.820
Yes.

02:04.856 --> 02:06.055
He misses all the nuance

02:06.090 --> 02:07.823
of the main character's voice.

02:07.859 --> 02:09.657
I need to call my editor.
Here.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.160
Sounds good to me,
listen to that.

02:11.195 --> 02:12.639
- Booth, do you mind?
- But there, too,

02:12.663 --> 02:14.408
Kathy could find no one.
All right, great, I'll just,

02:14.432 --> 02:15.865
you know, drive in silence.

02:21.672 --> 02:23.483
Bones, all I'm saying is,
you know, you should just...

02:23.507 --> 02:24.940
just stay in your lane, okay?

02:24.976 --> 02:26.286
Just let the publishers
do their job.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.654
I mean, come on,
what are you gonna do?

02:27.678 --> 02:28.911
Narrate your own book?
Yes,

02:28.946 --> 02:30.746
that's exactly what
I intend to do.

02:30.781 --> 02:32.125
I'll narrate it and
then have the audiobook

02:32.149 --> 02:35.517
reissued.
Good morning, you two.

02:35.553 --> 02:37.486
- Is everything okay?
- Excellent, excellent,

02:37.521 --> 02:40.456
compared to-to this guy here.
So, what, shotgun, right?

02:40.491 --> 02:41.944
'Cause we got shells all over
the place.

02:41.968 --> 02:43.126
Yep, techs found

02:43.127 --> 02:45.561
multiple shell casings from
what appears to be a 12-gauge.

02:45.596 --> 02:47.730
And I'm finding
birdshot inside the body.

02:47.765 --> 02:49.298
All right, so the killer,

02:49.333 --> 02:51.411
he stood over the body
and he shot him at close range.

02:51.435 --> 02:53.836
'Cause...

02:53.871 --> 02:55.237
Yeah, which sent bone

02:55.273 --> 02:56.283
and tissue flying everywhere

02:56.307 --> 02:57.473
within a ten-meter radius.

02:57.508 --> 02:58.474
Be careful what you touch.

02:58.509 --> 03:00.376
It's likely there's evidence

03:00.411 --> 03:01.744
even in the branches
of this tree.

03:01.779 --> 03:02.878
Wow.

03:02.914 --> 03:04.413
Time of death?
I'd say...

03:04.448 --> 03:05.781
Impossible to say,

03:05.816 --> 03:07.917
based on osteological evidence.

03:07.952 --> 03:10.586
Cam?
Based on decomp, two days.

03:10.621 --> 03:11.921
See, Bones?
You see what happens

03:11.956 --> 03:13.989
when you let people
do <i>their</i> job?

03:15.526 --> 03:17.960
Lack of arthritic deterioration

03:17.995 --> 03:19.828
suggests a young adult.

03:19.864 --> 03:23.532
However, with the skull
and the hands so damaged,

03:23.567 --> 03:25.768
determining I.D.
will be a challenge.

03:25.803 --> 03:28.270
And we got, uh,
no eyewitnesses, either.

03:28.306 --> 03:30.684
You got nothing on your canvass?
You know, people in this area,

03:30.708 --> 03:32.252
they just don't seem to be
too interested

03:32.276 --> 03:33.876
in talking to law enforcement.

03:33.911 --> 03:35.511
Wait!

03:35.546 --> 03:37.279
Oh.

03:37.315 --> 03:38.659
Oh, well, you know what?
That happens

03:38.683 --> 03:40.049
to the best of us, Aubrey.

03:40.084 --> 03:41.350
Anybody got a good dry cleaner?

03:41.385 --> 03:42.952
- Stay still.
- I got a great guy.

03:42.987 --> 03:44.820
I'll give you
the information later.

03:44.855 --> 03:46.388
Oh, Stan, on U Street?

03:46.424 --> 03:47.890
He is good with blood.

03:47.925 --> 03:49.291
Not so much with bile.

03:49.327 --> 03:50.960
Stan is not the man.
I got the guy.

03:50.995 --> 03:52.795
I use Susan at Dupont Cleaners.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.297
For blood and feces,
there's no one better.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.800
I got a better guy. Right next
door is this great sub shop.

03:57.835 --> 03:59.335
Okay, people.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.403
I think one is probably enough.

04:05.676 --> 04:08.610
Yeah, why doesn't everybody
just send me their guy?

04:08.646 --> 04:12.646

04:42.081 --> 04:44.786
Taking a closer look
at the victim's patellae,

04:44.787 --> 04:47.454
I'm seeing robust
tendinous attachments,

04:47.489 --> 04:51.425
as well as early-stage
osteoarthritis.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.326
So, bad knees.

04:53.362 --> 04:55.629
Yeah, the kind you see
after thousands of hours

04:55.664 --> 04:57.330
of manual labor. Ugh.

04:57.366 --> 04:59.833
The sheer drudgery depresses me.

04:59.868 --> 05:02.135
Hey, speaking of labor,
is Brennan really narrating

05:02.171 --> 05:03.403
her own audiobook?

05:03.439 --> 05:05.038
It's pretty crazy
how she managed

05:05.073 --> 05:07.207
to bring the Agent Andy
character back, right?

05:07.242 --> 05:09.676
Yeah.
Ooh, Fisher,

05:09.711 --> 05:11.389
you can tell us if the
science was authentic.

05:11.413 --> 05:13.313
So, a sternum transplant--

05:13.348 --> 05:14.981
is that for real?

05:16.351 --> 05:19.920
Oh, you guys actually read
Dr. Brennan's books?

05:19.955 --> 05:22.289
Uh... you don't?

05:22.324 --> 05:24.090
Well, no offense to her,
but I find them

05:24.126 --> 05:25.892
to be a little lowbrow.

05:25.928 --> 05:26.893
Okay, I would definitely not

05:26.929 --> 05:28.662
let Dr. B hear you say that.

05:28.697 --> 05:30.564
Yeah, I'm more into
the nihilists' work.

05:30.599 --> 05:33.099
Nietzsche, Kierkegaard,
Garfield.

05:33.135 --> 05:35.902
Like, the cartoon cat?

05:35.938 --> 05:37.337
Mm.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.607
Oh, it's gonna be difficult

05:40.642 --> 05:41.942
to get an I.D.

05:41.977 --> 05:43.121
Well, that's a pity.
But then again,

05:43.145 --> 05:44.277
Kierkegaard would say,

05:44.313 --> 05:47.080
the very idea of
individual identity

05:47.115 --> 05:50.617
was long ago subsumed by
the specter of the public.

05:50.652 --> 05:53.353
Is he still talking?
Hang on, Angela.

05:53.388 --> 05:55.789
Your camera's flash just...

05:55.824 --> 05:57.290
illuminated...

05:57.326 --> 06:00.193
yep, it's a contact lens.

06:00.229 --> 06:02.095
Dr. Hodgins?

06:02.130 --> 06:04.130
Yep.

06:04.166 --> 06:06.566
If we can pull his
fingerprint off it...

06:06.602 --> 06:08.802
Gonna be a long shot,
but I may be able

06:08.837 --> 06:11.338
to get I.D.

06:11.373 --> 06:13.206
The victim is Austin Wilson, 24.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.775
Booth and Brennan are talking
to his roommate.

06:15.811 --> 06:17.444
He's got a criminal record.

06:17.479 --> 06:19.045
Thank you. Here.

06:19.081 --> 06:20.280
Thank you.

06:22.885 --> 06:24.117
Nope, that must be yours.

06:24.152 --> 06:25.418
What is that?

06:25.454 --> 06:27.320
Come on,
it's the sweet nectar of life.

06:27.356 --> 06:30.824
It's the quad-shot cappuccino
with cinnamon in it.

06:30.859 --> 06:32.526
Oh, man.
Caffeine much?

06:32.561 --> 06:35.095
Well, I was up before dawn,
video-chatting with Jessica.

06:35.130 --> 06:36.630
She's on this Euro trip.
Mm-hmm.

06:36.665 --> 06:38.999
And with the time
difference, there's just...

06:39.034 --> 06:40.467
no chance to talk.
Mm, I'm jealous.

06:40.502 --> 06:43.036
I mean, of her trip.
You know, I went to Europe

06:43.071 --> 06:44.649
right after college,
and, I'm not trying to brag,

06:44.673 --> 06:46.873
but things got
a little bit crazy.

06:46.909 --> 06:50.310
Ooh! I'm so sorry.

06:51.547 --> 06:54.147
Hello, James.

06:57.219 --> 07:00.687
Oh, hi, I'm Karen, so...

07:00.722 --> 07:03.523
You mind giving us a minute?

07:03.559 --> 07:04.891
Sure, I'll, um...

07:04.927 --> 07:06.560
I'll meet you at the office.

07:10.232 --> 07:12.265
You look good, son.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.534
Hey, Dad.

07:15.437 --> 07:16.970
I tell you what.

07:17.005 --> 07:18.816
I'll make this easy on you.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.375
Why don't you turn around,
put your hands behind your back?

07:22.411 --> 07:23.944
James, don't be ridiculous.

07:23.979 --> 07:25.679
You can't just arrest me.

07:29.017 --> 07:30.750
Sit down, son.

07:30.786 --> 07:32.919
You and I need to talk.

07:37.759 --> 07:39.593
You sure it was Austin?

07:39.628 --> 07:41.027
We are.

07:41.063 --> 07:43.029
Listen, your friend was,
uh, killed by a shotgun

07:43.065 --> 07:44.664
in a pretty bad part of town.

07:44.700 --> 07:48.201
Any reason why he'd be
involved in criminal activity?

07:48.236 --> 07:49.736
No.

07:49.771 --> 07:51.449
No, people think 'cause
we came up in the system,

07:51.473 --> 07:53.373
we got to be gangsters.

07:53.408 --> 07:54.808
Not Austin.

07:54.843 --> 07:56.776
Look, no offense,

07:56.812 --> 07:58.912
but, uh, you have a record,

07:58.947 --> 08:01.481
and Austin was arrested
for assaulting a cop.

08:01.516 --> 08:03.617
No, that was
a misunderstanding.

08:03.652 --> 08:05.885
We were kids in high school.

08:05.921 --> 08:07.754
Riding bikes,
shaking up soda bottles,

08:07.789 --> 08:09.289
spraying them on people.

08:09.324 --> 08:11.725
Austin just got unlucky.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.561
He sprayed an off-duty cop.

08:14.596 --> 08:17.931
Evidence on the body suggests
he worked manual labor.

08:17.966 --> 08:19.366
Yeah.

08:19.401 --> 08:21.401
He was working
construction through college

08:21.436 --> 08:22.669
to pay for Princeton.

08:22.704 --> 08:23.970
Princeton, huh?

08:24.006 --> 08:25.572
What, 'cause he's a foster kid,

08:25.607 --> 08:27.374
he can't go to a good school?

08:27.409 --> 08:29.376
I assure you,
we think nothing of the sort.

08:29.411 --> 08:31.945
I myself spent time
in foster care.

08:33.315 --> 08:34.659
Look, do you know
where Austin worked?

08:34.683 --> 08:36.750
At this tutoring company.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.852
He was applying
to med school, also.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.553
Tutoring?
Like, I'm sorry,

08:40.589 --> 08:41.888
helping kids with
their homework?

08:41.923 --> 08:43.134
That's a common way
for graduates

08:43.158 --> 08:45.158
of elite schools to make money

08:45.193 --> 08:46.860
while they pursue

08:46.895 --> 08:48.895
graduate-level degrees.
I'm telling you,

08:48.930 --> 08:51.164
Austin had no life,
he had no girl.

08:51.199 --> 08:53.700
All he did was work and study.

08:53.735 --> 08:56.770
Those rich parents
were intense, too.

08:56.805 --> 08:59.272
You should look at them.

09:03.845 --> 09:06.413
Austin's phone records
show almost no contact

09:06.448 --> 09:07.647
with friends or family.

09:07.683 --> 09:09.182
Benny was right.

09:09.217 --> 09:10.550
His whole life was tutoring

09:10.585 --> 09:12.285
for money and preparing
for med school.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.853
That's sad, right, Bones?

09:13.889 --> 09:15.722
Everyone needs a little
fun in their lives.

09:15.757 --> 09:18.358
I rarely socialized between
college and graduate school.

09:18.393 --> 09:21.528
I find his work ethic admirable.

09:21.563 --> 09:24.497
Ugh.
What is it?

09:24.533 --> 09:26.032
My editor says that

09:26.068 --> 09:27.901
if I want to perform my novel,

09:27.936 --> 09:29.952
I have to... record an audition.

09:29.953 --> 09:30.885
Sure, it makes sense.

09:30.909 --> 09:32.540
Makes sense?
It does not make sense.

09:32.541 --> 09:34.018
It's insulting.
All right, well, there you go,

09:34.042 --> 09:36.087
tell her that you're-you're
not gonna do it. Problem solved.

09:36.111 --> 09:38.912
Don't be silly.
Of course, I'm gonna do it.

09:41.383 --> 09:42.649
<i>We were all horrified</i>

09:42.684 --> 09:43.850
to hear about Austin.

09:43.885 --> 09:45.129
Well, we were hoping
we could take a look around.

09:45.153 --> 09:46.330
If you must, but bear in mind,

09:46.354 --> 09:47.787
our students have been
traumatized.

09:47.823 --> 09:48.866
We're doing our best to maintain

09:48.890 --> 09:50.924
- a professional environment.
- Right.

09:50.959 --> 09:53.037
Well, we are still talking
about homework help, right?

09:53.061 --> 09:55.495
Well, we live in a competitive,
globalized world now.

09:55.530 --> 09:57.508
I founded this place to ensure
our students stay on top.

09:57.532 --> 09:58.898
We only hire

09:58.934 --> 10:01.101
the smartest tutors
from the best colleges.

10:01.136 --> 10:03.136
Harvard, Yale...
Northwestern.

10:03.171 --> 10:05.071
- Sure, if we're understaffed.
- Well...

10:05.107 --> 10:06.306
I attended Northwestern.

10:06.341 --> 10:07.974
It is quite prestigious.

10:08.009 --> 10:09.053
Oh, I'm sure it is, Dr. Brennan.

10:09.077 --> 10:10.510
No offense intended.

10:10.545 --> 10:12.946
Well, I assure you,
offense was taken.

10:12.981 --> 10:14.948
Well, let's all just calm down.

10:14.983 --> 10:16.087
So, was Austin here
the day he died?

10:16.088 --> 10:18.953
No, he met with
a few students off-site.

10:18.987 --> 10:21.065
Maybe we could take a look at
his work computers, files?

10:21.089 --> 10:23.423
- Of course. Yeah.
- Ms. Bryan?

10:23.458 --> 10:25.136
- What's up with the vending machine?
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Meredith.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.589
The repairman will
be here next week.

10:26.590 --> 10:27.261
If you wouldn't mind...

10:27.285 --> 10:29.607
Next week? How am I supposed
to focus without snacks?

10:29.998 --> 10:31.446
I completely understand
your frustration.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.267
Ms. Bryan, we heard that

10:33.268 --> 10:35.268
some of your clients, well,
most of your clients,

10:35.303 --> 10:37.771
were pretty much... demanding.

10:37.806 --> 10:41.441
Did Austin have any problems
or conflicts with any parents?

10:41.476 --> 10:42.976
Not that I can think of.

10:43.011 --> 10:45.278
What about Psycho Sue?

10:45.313 --> 10:46.313
Psycho Sue?

10:46.348 --> 10:47.480
That's what
some of the kids

10:47.516 --> 10:48.915
call Jacob's mother,
Sue Casey.

10:48.950 --> 10:49.883
She's passionate
but harmless.

10:49.918 --> 10:51.084
Harmless?

10:51.119 --> 10:53.586
She tried to run me over
with her SUV

10:53.622 --> 10:55.255
when I beat Jacob
in geography bee.

10:55.290 --> 10:57.168
- I'm sure that was an accident.
- And last week,

10:57.192 --> 10:59.692
I saw her yelling at Austin
in the parking lot.

10:59.728 --> 11:01.327
Then she slapped him
across the face.

11:01.363 --> 11:03.196
She hit Austin?

11:03.231 --> 11:04.898
Let's not...
Let's not what?

11:04.933 --> 11:06.933
You're just afraid of her

11:06.968 --> 11:09.068
because she threatened
to rip out your intestines.

11:09.104 --> 11:10.848
Well, those weren't
the exact words she used.

11:10.872 --> 11:13.339
No, but we're not supposed
to swear in here.

11:14.142 --> 11:15.542
It was, like...

11:15.577 --> 11:17.177
way worse.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.518
Okay, we'll have to
keep our voices down.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.287
Jacob's practicing for the SAT.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.156
His critical reading score
is stuck in the low 700s.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.292
Well, that puts him
well above average.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.005
Tell that to the
Harvard Admissions Committee.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.440
Mrs. Casey, do you
want to explain to us

11:37.464 --> 11:40.064
why you slapped Austin Wilson
last week?

11:40.099 --> 11:42.066
Sure. Austin
talked Jacob into

11:42.101 --> 11:43.367
applying early to UVA.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.571
The last eight generations
of this family

11:46.606 --> 11:48.172
have gone to Harvard.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.475
So, you slapped
Austin because he

11:50.510 --> 11:52.543
talked your son into
applying to a different,

11:52.579 --> 11:54.078
well-regarded university?

11:54.113 --> 11:56.280
I wasn't paying $300 an hour
for Jacob

11:56.316 --> 11:58.716
to get his heart set
on some community college.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.251
Mom.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.452
You're being a psycho.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.820
Our phone
records indicate

12:02.856 --> 12:04.722
that there were five
calls made from this house

12:04.757 --> 12:06.491
to his cell phone
the day he died.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.226
Uh, that was me.
That was you?

12:08.261 --> 12:10.728
Yeah, I had a huge
physics test the next day

12:10.763 --> 12:12.830
and I wanted him to
answer a question.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.032
Jacob, focus!

12:16.269 --> 12:17.535
Booth?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.669
Yep?

12:18.705 --> 12:20.204
Look.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.873
12-gauge.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.810
Wow. Are you guys
big hunters?

12:25.845 --> 12:27.945
Okay.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.247
I see where this is going.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.816
Look, Austin and I
had our differences.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.151
But he was a decent tutor

12:34.187 --> 12:35.253
and Jacob liked him.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.854
Uh, that's sweet and all,

12:36.890 --> 12:38.467
but we're still gonna
have to test your guns.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.224
Fine.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.660
Whatever it takes
to get some peace,

12:41.694 --> 12:43.160
so Jacob can focus.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.368
Cam, I was wondering if...

12:50.403 --> 12:52.637
Whoa, there.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.205
Duck season or wabbit season?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.173
Hey. I'm just trying
to determine

12:56.209 --> 12:57.441
whether Sue Casey's shotguns

12:57.477 --> 13:00.177
are a match for
our murder weapon.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.112
Dr. Saroyan?

13:01.147 --> 13:02.680
Whoa, there.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.850
Shh! Be vewy, vewy quiet.

13:05.885 --> 13:07.418
She's hunting wabbits.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.086
Come again?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.122
<i>Looney Tunes.</i>

13:10.156 --> 13:11.322
Oh, come on, man.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.224
Oh, cartoons upset me
as a child.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.725
More of an <i>Addams Family</i> kid?

13:14.761 --> 13:16.127
<i>Twilight Zone</i> reruns, actually.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.261
Everything
about you

13:17.297 --> 13:18.930
makes more sense now.
Mm.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.598
Did you need
something?

13:20.633 --> 13:24.201
Uh, yes. I found blunt force
trauma everywhere.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.537
The legs, the ribs, the skull.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.239
So, maybe our
victim was beaten

13:28.274 --> 13:31.509
before he was taken to the
location where he was shot.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.111
I don't think that he was shot
with these guns.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.379
You've determined
that already?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.848
Thanks to
<i>Parasteatoda tepidariorum.</i>

13:38.685 --> 13:39.850
Hmm.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.485
What is that?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.320
They're spiders, Cam.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.721
Oh, God!

13:43.756 --> 13:44.922
How about a warning for us

13:44.958 --> 13:47.725
non-Latin speakers
next time?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.427
Careful with that in my office.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.428
Oh, God, are
those eggs?

13:50.463 --> 13:52.530
Relax, Cam.
Geez.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.131
They're not gonna hatch.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.366
Oh, nice.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.834
They're in this one, too.

13:56.869 --> 13:57.969
Okay, not a fan.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.070
Okay, these must have been

13:59.105 --> 14:00.105
in Sue Casey's basement,

14:00.139 --> 14:01.372
because these webs

14:01.407 --> 14:02.807
take at least a week to...

14:05.578 --> 14:06.644
weave!

14:06.679 --> 14:07.745
What? Is something wrong?

14:07.780 --> 14:09.347
Mm-mm.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.481
Nope.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.349
I was just,
you know,

14:11.384 --> 14:12.795
I was-- I was--
I was thinking that--

14:12.819 --> 14:14.852
that-that-that suggests that--

14:14.887 --> 14:16.454
that these guns
over here

14:16.489 --> 14:17.922
were last fired

14:17.957 --> 14:20.091
long before
he was killed.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.692
Okay, hey,

14:21.728 --> 14:23.127
I've got an idea.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.261
Why don't you two

14:24.297 --> 14:25.763
take these guns

14:25.798 --> 14:26.998
and their inhabitants,

14:27.033 --> 14:28.699
and, uh, go far,

14:28.735 --> 14:29.934
far away?

14:29.969 --> 14:31.168
Good idea.
No problem.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.413
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

14:42.448 --> 14:43.981
Hmm? Mm-mm.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.183
Nope. Everything is...

14:46.219 --> 14:47.551
really good.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.055
I'm... gonna go.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.798
Hey.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.133
You, uh, you need any help?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.634
Uh, sure.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.314
I'm just starting in
on Austin's client files

15:05.338 --> 15:06.570
from the tutoring company.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.738
Grab a few.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.440
Totes.

15:09.475 --> 15:10.574
That's short for "totally."

15:10.610 --> 15:12.043
I know.
Okay.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.078
So, it looks like Austin
was pretty popular.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.714
He was gaining new clients
almost every week.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.349
Hmm, maybe some
of the other tutors

15:18.384 --> 15:19.817
got a little jealous.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.118
Yep, that's what
I'm thinking.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.921
So, how was it
seeing your dad yesterday?

15:25.792 --> 15:29.126
Come on. You didn't think
I'd notice who that was?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.497
Listen, I'm not gonna
tell anyone.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.766
I just wanted to come in
and see how you're doing.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.768
Well, look, I appreciate
the thought.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.737
But this is not therapy.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.617
Oh, I'm aware, it's just that
you always said that

15:41.641 --> 15:43.252
if you ever saw him again, he
would be arrested immediately.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.775
So...
There's a kid.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.477
A kid?

15:48.247 --> 15:49.613
The government's
been tracking

15:49.649 --> 15:51.093
and shutting down
his offshore accounts.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.150
But he's got a new
wife and a son.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.385
He came to me

15:54.420 --> 15:56.554
asking for money
to support them.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.123
Now, I don't care
what happens to my dad, but...

15:59.158 --> 16:01.392
This is your half brother.
So if you make that arrest,

16:01.427 --> 16:03.527
then he grows up without
a father, just like you did.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.429
Now, look, you don't
know Philip Aubrey.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.265
I mean, everything that
comes out of his mouth

16:07.300 --> 16:09.033
is a lie meant
to manipulate.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.469
I don't even know if the kid
in this photo is really his.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.437
But if you don't think
he's telling the truth,

16:13.473 --> 16:16.207
then why haven't you told
the FBI that you saw him?

16:20.346 --> 16:21.679
Boo-yah.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.013
You just got shrinked.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.549
Boo-yah?
Mm-hmm.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.784
You're so weird.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.285
Thank you.

16:29.555 --> 16:30.855
So,

16:30.890 --> 16:32.167
I think I'm starting
to see a pattern

16:32.191 --> 16:34.992
here with Austin's
newer students.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.338
A lot of them used to
work with this tutor

16:36.362 --> 16:38.629
named Matt Bogdan.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.231
Losing clients
means losing money.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.700
Maybe we should talk
to this Matt Bogdan guy.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.235
Totes.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.070
So Aubrey asked me

16:46.105 --> 16:47.304
to look into
communications

16:47.340 --> 16:50.174
between Austin
and his colleague, Matt.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.909
And I found this
online portal.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.043
"Tutor Talk"?

16:53.079 --> 16:54.378
Yeah.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.791
I've looked through
most of the messages

16:55.815 --> 16:57.815
and they're almost
all work-related.

16:57.850 --> 17:02.787
Hey, has Hodgins been acting
different around you lately?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.622
Um... this morning,

17:04.656 --> 17:06.656
he tried to get me to
taste a mold culture.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.059
So, no. Why?

17:09.095 --> 17:11.561
He's just been poking
his head in my office

17:11.597 --> 17:14.131
and then making excuses
to leave when he sees me.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.145
Hmm, he hasn't said anything
to me about it, but...

17:16.169 --> 17:17.867
Oh, hey, look.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.237
There is a message
from Matt to Austin.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.106
"Dude, answer my calls.

17:22.141 --> 17:23.607
"I'm asking one last time

17:23.643 --> 17:25.108
"to back off, or else.

17:25.144 --> 17:26.743
My life depends on it."

17:26.779 --> 17:30.748
Yeah, this was sent the day
before Austin was killed.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.715
I'll let Booth know.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.018
Oh, my God! Cam!

17:34.053 --> 17:35.152
What? What?

17:35.188 --> 17:36.654
No, no. What? What?

17:36.689 --> 17:38.022
Oh, God.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.990
Oh!

17:40.893 --> 17:42.026
Oh, God!

17:47.934 --> 17:50.401
I know Hodgins is your husband

17:50.436 --> 17:51.735
and your soul mate.

17:51.771 --> 17:52.970
Um, but I...

17:53.005 --> 17:55.706
No, no, we'll
kill him together.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.642
Yeah. This-this stays here.

17:58.678 --> 17:59.877
Yeah.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.880
You wrote an Op-Ed
for your college paper

18:02.915 --> 18:04.326
about how you bought
an assault weapon

18:04.350 --> 18:06.250
in 15 minutes.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.385
So, we know that you're
comfortable acquiring guns.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.288
Yeah, I'm <i>for</i> gun control.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.457
I wrote this column
to show how lax

18:13.492 --> 18:14.425
our system is.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.160
That's why I want
to go to law school.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.461
Law school's expensive.

18:17.496 --> 18:18.896
It must have been
pretty stressful

18:18.931 --> 18:20.397
losing all those clients
to Austin.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.433
Please. Money is
not an issue.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.401
I do this job for
the networking.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.136
Networking?
With 15-year-olds?

18:26.172 --> 18:27.605
With their parents.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.506
There's no better in

18:29.542 --> 18:32.309
with Beltway insiders
than their kids.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.713
Wait, so the last client
to switch from Matt to Austin

18:35.748 --> 18:37.681
was the daughter

18:37.717 --> 18:39.650
- of the solicitor general.
- That's...

18:39.685 --> 18:41.819
that's like, the most important
lawyer in the country.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.755
You must have been pretty
desperate to maintain that

18:44.790 --> 18:45.790
networking
opportunity.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.925
Okay, yeah.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.562
I did beg Austin to let
me keep one student.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.397
He refused.

18:53.432 --> 18:54.854
But I would never
murder him over it!

18:54.878 --> 18:55.567
Come on.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.301
You weren't just
a little bit jealous

18:57.336 --> 19:00.070
of Austin being so much
more talented than you?

19:00.106 --> 19:02.284
No, see, that's the thing.
Austin wasn't a better tutor.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.042
And denial is just a member
of One Direction.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.811
It's a guy in the band.
I know.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.213
Seriously.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.714
Look at our metrics.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.317
Okay, my students
saw their SAT scores

19:13.352 --> 19:16.420
increase by more points,
on average, than Austin's.

19:16.455 --> 19:17.532
And I never did
really figure out

19:17.556 --> 19:20.824
what it was that parents
preferred about him.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.665
Hey, uh, has anyone seen Cam?

19:27.700 --> 19:28.999
She's at home,

19:29.035 --> 19:30.668
showering and changing.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.336
Which means you should escape

19:32.371 --> 19:33.637
while you still can.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.339
But first, swab results?

19:35.374 --> 19:38.309
Nothing that indicates where
Austin was knocked unconscious.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.477
But I did find
methylsulfonylmethane

19:40.513 --> 19:42.680
and vitamin C,
two ingredients commonly used

19:42.715 --> 19:44.515
in anti-wrinkle cream.
Huh.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.617
That's weird.
Austin's in his 20s.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.285
Why would he be
worried about aging?

19:48.321 --> 19:51.021
Well, I didn't tell you
where I found the particulates.

19:51.057 --> 19:54.391
They were on his boxers,
right by...

19:54.427 --> 19:56.327
let's just say
his lower abdominal area.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.728
Okay, so that means

19:57.763 --> 19:58.929
someone much older than him

19:58.965 --> 20:00.597
had their hands down his pants.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.499
Oh, well, that explains it.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.500
Explains what?

20:03.536 --> 20:07.137
Why mothers prefer...

20:07.173 --> 20:10.307
Austin's services over Matt's.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.875
Yeah, I don't...
I...

20:11.911 --> 20:13.277
Oh, my God, you guys. Really?

20:13.312 --> 20:15.713
Come on. Austin's,
like, a total hunk.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.983
Objectively speaking,
he does appear more virile.

20:19.018 --> 20:19.917
Really?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.285
Looks like one of the mothers

20:21.320 --> 20:23.253
at the tutoring place
thought so, too.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.521
Mm-hmm.

20:28.924 --> 20:30.290
<i>Dr. Fisher,</i>

20:30.325 --> 20:32.659
on the scapulae
and the left radius,

20:32.694 --> 20:35.228
I'm seeing blunt
force trauma

20:35.264 --> 20:36.930
that suggests the
victim was hit

20:36.965 --> 20:39.699
with some object
with an angular edge.

20:39.735 --> 20:41.168
Yes,

20:41.203 --> 20:43.703
the damage is consistent
with a squared-off object,

20:43.739 --> 20:44.871
like a 2x4.

20:44.907 --> 20:46.973
I concur.
How are you progressing

20:47.009 --> 20:48.208
with your skull reassembly?

20:48.243 --> 20:49.609
In process.

20:49.645 --> 20:51.289
How are you progressing
with your audiobook?

20:51.313 --> 20:52.812
Very well.
Hmm.

20:52.848 --> 20:54.247
Not that it interests you.

20:55.217 --> 20:56.883
Angela told you.

20:58.053 --> 21:00.820
I am a contemptible fool
for trusting her.

21:00.856 --> 21:03.123
Tell me, what is it
about my novels

21:03.158 --> 21:04.658
that you find so objectionable?

21:04.693 --> 21:07.127
I don't know that I should
speak frankly here.

21:07.162 --> 21:08.395
But...

21:08.430 --> 21:09.440
from what little I've read,

21:09.464 --> 21:11.464
I find them to be cheap

21:11.500 --> 21:14.234
and lacking a certain
perspicacity.

21:14.269 --> 21:15.335
Perspicacity?

21:15.370 --> 21:17.270
Yes, it's a common
vocabulary word

21:17.306 --> 21:18.638
for my SAT students.

21:18.674 --> 21:20.507
It means shrewdness, or insight.

21:20.542 --> 21:21.975
I'm aware of what it means.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.143
I merely thought it

21:23.178 --> 21:24.444
an interesting choice.

21:24.479 --> 21:26.313
Hang on.

21:26.348 --> 21:29.783
There is a slight contusion
on this fragment

21:29.818 --> 21:32.652
of the frontal bone
and its corresponding piece.

21:32.688 --> 21:34.421
See that?
Just a small nick.

21:34.456 --> 21:36.723
A slight puncture,

21:36.758 --> 21:39.359
conforming to the
shape of a human incisor.

21:39.394 --> 21:41.005
I've seen this injury profile
in cases where

21:41.029 --> 21:43.096
the victim head-butted
an attacker.

21:43.131 --> 21:45.109
So the victim got into a fight
shortly before he died.

21:45.133 --> 21:47.534
Given the evidence
of the hand cream,

21:47.569 --> 21:49.080
and if he was sleeping
with married women,

21:49.104 --> 21:51.071
we might be looking
for a jealous husband.

21:52.708 --> 21:55.342
A melodrama worthy
of one of your pulp novels.

21:55.377 --> 21:59.379
Maybe that's enough speaking
frankly for you today.

22:01.250 --> 22:03.950
Look, this is all just a...
a big misunderstanding.

22:03.986 --> 22:05.218
Where's my wife?

22:05.254 --> 22:07.153
She's with another agent,
Mr. Mills.

22:07.189 --> 22:08.655
But never mind her.

22:08.690 --> 22:11.758
Austin was at your house
the day he died.

22:11.793 --> 22:13.960
ER records show that
you checked yourself in

22:13.996 --> 22:16.129
for the broken nose that night.

22:16.164 --> 22:17.797
No use denying that.

22:17.833 --> 22:21.768
Look, I understand
how enraged you must've been.

22:21.803 --> 22:26.006
You found your son's tutor
with your wife.

22:26.041 --> 22:28.675
You killed him by accident?
No.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.176
Look, he's the one

22:30.212 --> 22:31.645
that overreacted.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.912
He head-butted me.

22:32.948 --> 22:35.015
Hard.
So you fought back.

22:35.050 --> 22:38.084
Hope your wife's
telling the same story.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.753
So, Mrs. Mills,
how long have you been

22:39.788 --> 22:42.822
sleeping with Austin?
Please, call me Cornelia.

22:42.858 --> 22:44.121
And I wasn't sleeping
with Austin.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.192
Come on,

22:45.193 --> 22:46.593
there's no reason to deny it.

22:46.628 --> 22:48.595
We know that you
had your hands down his pants.

22:48.630 --> 22:49.863
Yeah.

22:49.898 --> 22:52.299
I went for his goods

22:52.334 --> 22:55.068
because I knew that Gavin was
about to walk through the door.

22:55.103 --> 22:57.470
So you wanted
your husband to catch you?

22:57.506 --> 23:02.809
Gavin and I both run
very stressful legal practices.

23:02.844 --> 23:04.144
We need a release.

23:04.179 --> 23:06.246
And there is nothing

23:06.281 --> 23:11.184
like that feeling
of being caught in the act.

23:11.219 --> 23:12.986
It's a horrible feeling.

23:13.021 --> 23:17.190
My wife... gets off
on taunting me with other men.

23:17.225 --> 23:18.391
Of course,

23:18.427 --> 23:21.227
Austin's hardly the first.
No?

23:21.263 --> 23:23.396
Oh, heck, no, no,
there was the-the gardener,

23:23.432 --> 23:26.399
the pool guy, the piano tuner.

23:26.435 --> 23:28.768
So Austin,
he was the final straw.

23:28.804 --> 23:32.138
No, this wasn't even
the first time with Austin.

23:32.174 --> 23:33.973
Usually, he just
pushed her off, but...

23:34.009 --> 23:36.376
this time,
Austin seemed different.

23:36.411 --> 23:39.079
Angry.
He head-butted you.

23:39.114 --> 23:40.847
A-And then he yelled
something like, uh,

23:40.882 --> 23:42.549
"You people are all nuts.

23:42.584 --> 23:44.495
"You think money means you can
get away with everything.

23:44.519 --> 23:46.186
I'm done."

23:46.221 --> 23:47.754
Then Austin, uh, stormed out

23:47.789 --> 23:49.789
and that's the last
that I saw of him.

23:49.825 --> 23:52.926
Great, thank you, Mrs. Mills.

23:52.961 --> 23:54.594
I told you, it's Cornelia.

23:54.629 --> 23:57.430
Uh-huh, you're free to go.

23:57.466 --> 23:59.277
We're gonna hold your husband
for a little bit,

23:59.301 --> 24:01.034
check out his alibi.

24:01.069 --> 24:02.435
But in the meantime,

24:02.471 --> 24:03.781
anything else that
you may come up...

24:03.805 --> 24:07.374
Why don't you give me your cell?

24:07.409 --> 24:10.110
In case I do come up
with something?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.324
Hey.

24:24.359 --> 24:25.992
Anything in Austin's
files that suggests

24:26.027 --> 24:27.961
why he more stressed than usual?

24:27.996 --> 24:31.931
He was juggling about 50
students, but that was normal.

24:31.967 --> 24:33.633
I seriously doubt that.

24:33.668 --> 24:35.502
In my tutoring days,

24:35.537 --> 24:37.404
I could juggle
up to ten students.

24:37.439 --> 24:39.839
To imagine Austin being
five times more productive

24:39.875 --> 24:41.374
strains credulity.

24:41.410 --> 24:43.643
Yeah, that does seem like a lot.

24:43.678 --> 24:44.785
Do you have something for me,
Dr. Fisher?

24:44.809 --> 24:45.746
Yes.

24:45.747 --> 24:47.580
Hodgins got these
swab results back

24:47.616 --> 24:49.682
from the blunt
force trauma injuries.

24:49.718 --> 24:51.851
And he had you deliver them?

24:51.887 --> 24:53.820
I think he was
afraid to see you.

24:53.855 --> 24:56.723
But he did say whatever
Austin was beaten with

24:56.758 --> 25:00.293
was made of stainless steel,
and had trace of leather.

25:00.328 --> 25:02.295
I'm thinking it was found in the

25:02.330 --> 25:03.630
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> aisle.

25:03.665 --> 25:05.465
Thank you for that image.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.699
Mm.

25:06.735 --> 25:09.269
So these are Austin's
client invoices.

25:09.304 --> 25:11.638
All I have to do is let
the computer scan the dates

25:11.673 --> 25:13.006
and times of the appointments.

25:13.041 --> 25:14.774
That's odd.

25:14.810 --> 25:17.347
It looks like he was regularly
triple-booking clients.

25:17.348 --> 25:19.448
Oh, I see

25:19.481 --> 25:20.713
what's going on here.

25:20.749 --> 25:22.882
Scams like this are
running rampant.

25:22.918 --> 25:24.083
Parents are paying

25:24.119 --> 25:25.919
cash-strapped college grads

25:25.954 --> 25:28.321
to take online classes
for their kids.

25:28.356 --> 25:30.290
So Austin's students
were cheating?

25:30.325 --> 25:32.659
Well, some of them might
have been honest.

25:32.694 --> 25:34.461
But he would've charged
the cheaters extra.

25:34.496 --> 25:36.629
Well, if that's true,
Austin's boss, Amy,

25:36.665 --> 25:38.331
would certainly know about it.

25:42.504 --> 25:43.703
Ms. Bryan,

25:43.738 --> 25:45.349
Special Agent Aubrey.
This is my colleague,

25:45.373 --> 25:46.573
Karen Delfs.

25:46.608 --> 25:47.874
Hi.
You want to come on down?

25:47.909 --> 25:49.209
This again.

25:49.244 --> 25:50.577
Look, as I told your colleagues,

25:50.612 --> 25:51.923
we all want to help,
but this is disrupting

25:51.947 --> 25:53.880
my students'
learning environment.

25:53.915 --> 25:55.426
Don't you mean disrupting
the tutors that you have

25:55.450 --> 25:56.894
taking the students'
classes for them?

25:56.918 --> 25:59.519
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:59.554 --> 26:01.554
Oh.
And I told your people already,

26:01.590 --> 26:03.890
we didn't see Austin
the day he died.

26:03.925 --> 26:06.159
So, I'm sorry, there's nothing
more I can do for you.

26:07.963 --> 26:09.729
Oh.

26:11.366 --> 26:12.999
Look at that.

26:19.407 --> 26:20.473
Is that dried blood?

26:20.509 --> 26:21.741
Austin was injured

26:21.776 --> 26:23.943
by an object made of steel

26:23.979 --> 26:26.279
with traces of leather.

26:26.314 --> 26:29.215
So kind of like these stairs,
with shoe leather on them.

26:30.418 --> 26:32.018
He fell down the stairs.

26:32.053 --> 26:34.254
We're gonna have to ask you
to come with us.

26:34.289 --> 26:36.155
This learning environment
you got here

26:36.191 --> 26:38.091
is now a crime scene.

26:44.502 --> 26:46.262
Look, I'm only gonna ask you
one last time.

26:46.489 --> 26:48.767
What was Austin doing in the
office the night that he died?

26:48.791 --> 26:50.336
Amy, I would advise you

26:50.360 --> 26:51.837
- not to answer any more questions.
- Whoa.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.038
I'm sorry, what are you doing?

26:53.062 --> 26:55.563
I'll be representing Ms. Bryan.

26:55.598 --> 26:57.565
My son is her client,
so representing her

26:57.600 --> 27:00.101
in this matter is
the least I can do.

27:00.136 --> 27:01.536
She lied to us,
you understand me?

27:01.571 --> 27:03.115
Austin was gonna blow
the whistle on her.

27:03.139 --> 27:05.239
This is insane, I never spoke to
Austin that day.

27:05.275 --> 27:06.607
That's enough, Amy.

27:06.643 --> 27:09.110
Agent Booth,
what I'm hearing is that

27:09.145 --> 27:10.711
you have no physical evidence

27:10.747 --> 27:12.847
to tie my client to the murder,

27:12.882 --> 27:15.583
or to suggest her knowledge
of Austin's cheating.

27:15.618 --> 27:17.730
Well, it's difficult to believe
Amy didn't know about it.

27:17.754 --> 27:20.621
She was making money off
of Austin's fraudulent work.

27:20.657 --> 27:22.957
I have something that

27:22.992 --> 27:25.626
you might want to see.

27:25.662 --> 27:30.064
This is a list of each student
Amy met with in her office

27:30.099 --> 27:32.466
the night of
Austin's death, as well as

27:32.502 --> 27:33.679
stills from the security footage

27:33.703 --> 27:36.070
of Amy out to eat
at a restaurant

27:36.105 --> 27:38.606
30 miles away from
where the body was found.

27:39.776 --> 27:41.008
My client's alibi
is documented

27:41.044 --> 27:43.277
and it is airtight.

27:43.313 --> 27:44.979
Amy?

27:45.014 --> 27:47.648
So, if that is all...

27:48.985 --> 27:50.985
Or maybe it isn't all.

27:51.020 --> 27:52.720
Agent Booth?

27:56.459 --> 27:58.793
Weird.

27:58.828 --> 28:00.227
<i>I'm gonna have the</i>

28:00.263 --> 28:02.263
cheeseburger, side of fries.

28:02.298 --> 28:03.965
Nothing for me, thanks.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.866
- Okay.
- Nothing? Are you feeling okay?

28:05.902 --> 28:08.069
I'm just not that
hungry, that's all.

28:10.373 --> 28:14.241
So, Dr. Brennan, how's the,
uh, audiobook career coming?

28:14.277 --> 28:16.677
Don't encourage her.
Very well, thank you.

28:16.713 --> 28:18.446
I finished recording my audition

28:18.481 --> 28:20.281
and sent it in to my editor.

28:20.316 --> 28:22.416
- Hmm.
- Cool. Let's hear it.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.385
Oh, wow.
Sure.

28:24.420 --> 28:27.521
Andy and Kathy were
in a predicament.

28:27.557 --> 28:28.990
"Where are we?" Kathy asked.

28:29.025 --> 28:31.459
"I'm not sure just yet,"

28:31.494 --> 28:33.527
- Andy said.
- Hold on.

28:33.563 --> 28:35.830
I'm sorry, that is your voice
for Agent Andy?

28:35.865 --> 28:37.632
Yes, that's exactly how
I hear him in my head

28:37.667 --> 28:39.066
- when I write.
- No.

28:39.102 --> 28:40.534
That is... really good.

28:40.570 --> 28:41.836
It's really good.

28:41.871 --> 28:43.037
Recording quality,

28:43.072 --> 28:44.538
super clear.

28:47.310 --> 28:49.276
So the case?
Right.

28:49.312 --> 28:50.544
So, look, even if Austin

28:50.580 --> 28:51.779
didn't actually see Amy

28:51.814 --> 28:53.047
the night that he died,

28:53.082 --> 28:54.515
based on what he said
at the Mills',

28:54.550 --> 28:56.517
clearly, he went there
ready to quit.

28:56.552 --> 28:58.397
The question is, what happened
outside those offices

28:58.421 --> 29:00.554
that stopped him
from going inside?

29:02.925 --> 29:05.192
This is a map of all
the gunshots on the body.

29:05.228 --> 29:06.827
What do the colors represent?

29:06.863 --> 29:09.730
Each color corresponds
with one of the five shots.

29:09.766 --> 29:11.632
But it's still
a little bit unclear.

29:11.668 --> 29:12.933
Now, what if you

29:12.969 --> 29:14.168
take this image

29:14.203 --> 29:16.470
and place it on top of

29:16.506 --> 29:19.206
an overhead view of
the crime scene, and then

29:19.242 --> 29:21.475
map out the areas where
the pellets hit the ground?

29:21.511 --> 29:23.644
Oh, that's a good idea.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.814
Okay, this'll just
take me a few seconds.

29:26.849 --> 29:29.450
Hey, have you figured out what
you're gonna do to Hodgins yet?

29:29.485 --> 29:31.318
You sure you want to know?

29:34.490 --> 29:36.590
Oh, yeah, much clearer.

29:36.626 --> 29:39.827
The killer fired while
standing directly over the body.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.896
The spray is too spread out.

29:46.536 --> 29:48.302
Oof.

29:48.337 --> 29:49.970
Okay, yeah, you're right.

29:50.006 --> 29:51.472
It doesn't match.

29:51.507 --> 29:53.240
Given the size
of the spray range,

29:53.276 --> 29:55.476
the killer would've
had to have shot

29:55.511 --> 29:57.078
from several meters overhead.

29:57.113 --> 30:00.648
But not if the barrel
was shortened.

30:00.683 --> 30:02.783
What, like a sawed-off shotgun?

30:02.819 --> 30:03.784
Exactly.

30:03.820 --> 30:05.019
Adjust the simulation

30:05.054 --> 30:07.154
for a barrel length of...

30:07.190 --> 30:08.656
30 centimeters.

30:08.691 --> 30:11.792
Okay.

30:11.828 --> 30:13.294
Yeah, that works.

30:13.329 --> 30:14.895
But, wait, isn't it illegal

30:14.931 --> 30:17.131
to even own a sawed-off shotgun?

30:17.166 --> 30:19.366
It is.
So we're not looking for someone

30:19.402 --> 30:21.102
with a gun used to hunt.

30:21.137 --> 30:22.548
No, we're looking
for somebody with a gun

30:22.572 --> 30:24.371
used to commit a crime.

30:28.978 --> 30:32.446
Aubrey, didn't they tell you
there's cake in the break room?

30:32.482 --> 30:34.749
Look at that, huh?
Hey, no, I'm okay.

30:36.152 --> 30:37.796
Okay, that's it.
What the hell's wrong with you?

30:37.820 --> 30:38.753
Come on.

30:38.788 --> 30:40.254
All right, look,

30:40.289 --> 30:42.656
I don't want this to
interfere with work,

30:42.692 --> 30:44.725
but you know that my dad
is back in the country.

30:44.761 --> 30:46.505
Yeah, I know, we got people
out there looking for him.

30:46.529 --> 30:49.063
Yeah, no, I know,
it's just, uh...

30:49.098 --> 30:50.731
it's on my mind, that's all.

30:50.767 --> 30:54.602
Anyway, uh, this is
every case file for

30:54.637 --> 30:56.003
crimes committed
in the past year

30:56.038 --> 30:57.238
involving a sawed-off shotgun.

30:57.273 --> 30:58.472
There's a lot of them.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.875
You can throw out
any of the, uh,

31:00.910 --> 31:03.177
gun-holders that
were arrested, right?

31:03.212 --> 31:05.023
You can't kill someone
if you're already in prison.

31:05.047 --> 31:06.180
That's for sure.

31:06.215 --> 31:09.150
Oh. Wow.

31:09.185 --> 31:11.018
Thick, eh?

31:11.053 --> 31:13.053
You know, my old man,
he was a piece of work.

31:13.089 --> 31:15.222
Yeah, he drank, right?

31:15.258 --> 31:16.991
Yeah.

31:17.026 --> 31:19.260
He drank, and he beat the crap
out of me and my brother,

31:19.295 --> 31:21.162
till Pops took us in.

31:21.197 --> 31:23.664
I guess neither one of us
drew very well

31:23.699 --> 31:25.833
in the fatherhood lottery.
Well, you know,

31:25.868 --> 31:27.301
with my dad,
he died a while back.

31:27.336 --> 31:29.203
I never got a chance
to really confront him.

31:29.238 --> 31:31.906
Tell him how I really feel,
you know, man-to-man.

31:35.211 --> 31:38.212
Look, Booth, let's just suppose
that I know where my dad...

31:38.247 --> 31:41.549
Stop talking.

31:41.584 --> 31:43.295
All I'm saying is,
when we do bring your father in,

31:43.319 --> 31:47.188
maybe you'll get a chance
for some closure.

31:50.293 --> 31:51.425
Well, look at this.

31:51.460 --> 31:52.860
I think I got something.
What is it?

31:52.895 --> 31:54.094
Convenience store robbery

31:54.130 --> 31:56.363
about a month ago.

31:56.399 --> 31:59.767
This look like anyone
that we know?

31:59.802 --> 32:01.769
It's Austin's roommate, Benny.

32:01.804 --> 32:03.482
Yeah, he's got
the same weapon that was used

32:03.506 --> 32:05.206
to kill his friend.

32:07.166 --> 32:09.527
So, looks like your best bud
Austin was murdered

32:09.528 --> 32:11.109
with a sawed-off shotgun.

32:11.209 --> 32:12.442
You recognize
that cashier?

32:12.477 --> 32:13.643
Because he recognized you.

32:13.678 --> 32:15.545
Picked you out of a lineup,
no problem.

32:15.580 --> 32:18.581
I get it, this looks bad.
But like I told you,

32:18.616 --> 32:20.983
I would never,
ever hurt Austin.

32:21.019 --> 32:22.630
What are you saying? Is this
some kind of coincidence?

32:22.654 --> 32:26.589
No. You say it was
a sawed-off?

32:26.624 --> 32:28.724
Then, yeah, it was my gun
that killed him.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.793
Look, I fell in
with the wrong people,

32:30.829 --> 32:32.562
into some bad things
that I shouldn't have.

32:32.597 --> 32:35.164
Austin, he found out.
He was pissed.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.744
He called me on it, he told me
I was better than that.

32:36.768 --> 32:38.701
So he was gonna turn you in.

32:38.736 --> 32:40.214
You and your buddies
decided to shut him up?

32:40.238 --> 32:42.038
No. Austin was no snitch.

32:42.073 --> 32:44.607
No. He took the gun from me,
and the ammo, and he hid it.

32:44.642 --> 32:46.108
He was holding the sawed-off.

32:46.144 --> 32:47.288
One of the parents must
have found it and--

32:47.312 --> 32:48.789
You know what? I'm getting
sick and tired of you

32:48.813 --> 32:51.280
pointing the finger
at everyone except yourself.

32:53.685 --> 32:56.786
You're right.
It was my gun.

32:56.821 --> 32:58.421
And I have to live with that.

32:58.456 --> 33:01.491
But I didn't kill him.

33:03.161 --> 33:06.329
You think it was one
of his students, Benny?

33:06.364 --> 33:10.800
No. No. Those kids,
they idolized him.

33:10.835 --> 33:14.303
I used to joke, those rich
kids were just a paycheck.

33:14.339 --> 33:16.973
Austin, he made them feel
like it was something else,

33:17.008 --> 33:20.743
like they were friends
or something, you know?

33:20.778 --> 33:22.678
They loved him.

33:22.714 --> 33:27.049
I'm telling you,
look at the parents.

33:31.489 --> 33:32.922
Dr. Brennan,
you found something?

33:32.957 --> 33:36.392
Take a look at this injury
on the left humerus.

33:36.427 --> 33:38.194
Blunt force trauma.

33:38.229 --> 33:40.563
Most likely from
falling down the stairs.

33:40.598 --> 33:43.733
Perhaps. But there are
far more hairline fractures

33:43.768 --> 33:45.334
surrounding the site

33:45.370 --> 33:48.237
than on the other
stair-related injuries.

33:48.273 --> 33:50.072
So you think
something else caused it?

33:50.108 --> 33:52.942
I should have Dr. Hodgins swab
the wound site immediately.

33:52.977 --> 33:55.278
You know what?
Let me take it to him.

33:55.313 --> 33:58.014
It's time he and I
had a little chat.

34:07.458 --> 34:11.127
Dr. Hodgins, Dr. Brennan
wanted you to look

34:11.161 --> 34:14.297
for trace in this injury
she found on the humerus.

34:14.331 --> 34:16.065
Yeah. Sure. I'm on it.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.400
Also, I thought
we should talk.

34:18.436 --> 34:20.402
Right.

34:20.438 --> 34:23.806
So how much trouble am I in?

34:23.841 --> 34:25.741
Oh, please, Dr. Hodgins.

34:25.777 --> 34:29.277
Actually, I-- I'm looking
at this little episode

34:29.313 --> 34:31.246
as an opportunity
for self-reflection.

34:31.282 --> 34:32.882
You are?

34:32.917 --> 34:34.617
Well, the fact that
one of my colleagues

34:34.652 --> 34:35.985
was so afraid of me
that he would

34:36.020 --> 34:38.454
cover up a spider infestation
in my office

34:38.489 --> 34:41.824
makes me think I should
reconsider my management style.

34:41.859 --> 34:44.092
So you're just
gonna forgive me?

34:44.128 --> 34:47.964
Well, either that,
or I wait until you're lulled

34:47.998 --> 34:50.766
into a sense of security--
maybe days, maybe months.

34:50.802 --> 34:54.003
And then when you least expect
it, exact my revenge.

34:54.038 --> 34:56.871
Are you serious?
Come on, Cam.

34:56.908 --> 34:59.408
That anticipation,
that's just cruel.

34:59.444 --> 35:01.043
Almost like living
in constant fear

35:01.079 --> 35:03.913
that there might be a spider
crawling in your hair?

35:03.948 --> 35:05.615
You might want to hurry up
with the swab.

35:05.650 --> 35:07.683
You don't want
to keep me waiting.

35:10.588 --> 35:12.355
We searched Benny's place
high and low.

35:12.390 --> 35:14.557
No sign of the murder weapon.

35:14.592 --> 35:16.032
Well, maybe he was
telling the truth.

35:16.060 --> 35:17.193
I might have something.

35:17.228 --> 35:18.794
Benny said that
all the students

35:18.830 --> 35:20.196
really adored Austin, right?

35:20.231 --> 35:22.331
That they thought
the world of him.

35:22.367 --> 35:24.111
They thought of him as more
of a friend than a tutor.

35:24.135 --> 35:25.968
Which means none of them
had motive to kill.

35:26.004 --> 35:27.748
Except that I've worked
hundreds of stalking cases,

35:27.772 --> 35:30.506
and nine times out of ten it's
not the overtly threatening type

35:30.541 --> 35:32.086
that you want to be worried
about, 'cause, see,

35:32.110 --> 35:34.088
they're getting their aggression
out through their words.

35:34.112 --> 35:35.289
The ones that should scare you--

35:35.313 --> 35:37.947
Are the ones who
express their affection.

35:37.982 --> 35:39.493
So what you're saying,
maybe if a student was

35:39.517 --> 35:40.816
attached enough to Austin--

35:40.852 --> 35:42.618
Then that student
would be very upset

35:42.654 --> 35:44.420
to find out that Austin
was leaving.

35:44.455 --> 35:45.766
Aubrey, get a list of
all the kids who were

35:45.790 --> 35:47.223
at the tutoring office
that night.

35:47.258 --> 35:49.025
So I should just...

35:49.060 --> 35:50.626
Okay.

35:55.066 --> 35:57.099
You know?

35:57.135 --> 36:00.102
Oh, great. Now what?
Just need

36:00.138 --> 36:02.505
to ask your son a couple follow-
up questions, that's all.

36:02.540 --> 36:05.775
Uh, no. Sorry. We already
told you everything we know.

36:05.810 --> 36:07.843
Except Jacob failed
to mention that he was

36:07.879 --> 36:10.446
at the tutoring offices
the night that Austin died.

36:10.481 --> 36:13.983
I didn't lie. I told you
I had a question about physics,

36:14.018 --> 36:15.551
but Austin wouldn't pick up.

36:15.586 --> 36:18.587
So I rode my bike over
to see if Amy could help.

36:18.623 --> 36:20.489
There. He answered
your question.

36:20.525 --> 36:22.024
Now could you please leave?

36:22.060 --> 36:23.726
Oh, hold on for a second.

36:23.761 --> 36:26.495
Bones, take a look
at that bag, will you?

36:26.531 --> 36:28.342
Shape seems right.
It corresponds to the injury

36:28.366 --> 36:31.467
I found on the humerus.
What is she talking about?

36:31.502 --> 36:34.336
Our lab found axle grease
on Austin's body.

36:34.372 --> 36:37.606
If Jacob put his bike
inside Austin's trunk

36:37.642 --> 36:39.675
along with the body,
the peg could have

36:39.711 --> 36:43.245
pressed up against
Austin's humerus.

36:45.116 --> 36:48.250
Booth, there's blood residue
all over this bike.

36:48.286 --> 36:49.685
Okay. You have
no right to be here.

36:49.721 --> 36:52.054
You saw Austin outside
the tutoring offices

36:52.090 --> 36:53.355
that night, didn't you?

36:53.391 --> 36:54.857
He told you
he was gonna quit.

36:54.892 --> 36:58.194
Well, I asked him
if we'd still hang out.

36:58.229 --> 37:02.131
He said no. He said I was
nothing but a paycheck to him.

37:02.166 --> 37:03.499
That must have
made you mad.

37:03.534 --> 37:06.969
Jacob, what did you do?

37:07.004 --> 37:08.771
I didn't do anything.

37:08.806 --> 37:10.250
All right, he's the one
who picked a fight.

37:10.274 --> 37:13.442
I-I didn't mean for him
to fall down the stairs.

37:14.545 --> 37:16.712
But after he did...

37:16.748 --> 37:18.314
You drove him to
a bad part of town

37:18.349 --> 37:19.993
and you shot up his body so it
wouldn't look like an accident.

37:20.017 --> 37:22.051
Jacob, tell them they're wrong.

37:22.086 --> 37:24.320
Mom, would you just shut up?

37:27.225 --> 37:29.492
I just-- I didn't--
I didn't want to lose

37:29.527 --> 37:31.861
everything I worked for.

37:34.432 --> 37:37.633
He called me a <i>paycheck.</i>

38:06.397 --> 38:11.167
Hey. I figured if I waited here
long enough, you'd show up.

38:11.202 --> 38:13.469
It's safe for us?

38:13.504 --> 38:14.982
Does this mean you've
thought about things?

38:15.006 --> 38:16.972
That, uh, you're
gonna help me?

38:17.008 --> 38:19.809
Not you. This kid.

38:19.844 --> 38:23.913
I thought about how I grew up,
seeing your face on the news,

38:23.948 --> 38:25.748
seeing Mom cry.

38:25.783 --> 38:28.350
I wouldn't wish that
childhood on anyone.

38:29.687 --> 38:32.354
You know, I never would have
left if I didn't think

38:32.390 --> 38:34.023
you could handle it...

38:34.058 --> 38:37.827
that you'd turn out to be
such a good man.

38:37.862 --> 38:39.829
And I was right.

38:39.864 --> 38:43.065
I'm proud of you, James.

38:43.100 --> 38:45.267
You're one of
the only good things

38:45.303 --> 38:47.303
I've ever done in my life.

38:49.774 --> 38:53.375
You know, a friend of mine says
that people can change.

38:53.411 --> 38:55.344
Maybe he's right.

39:01.853 --> 39:06.488
But I'm just not ready
to believe in you.

39:06.524 --> 39:08.591
Philip Aubrey,
you're under arrest.

39:09.727 --> 39:12.995
This was a mistake, James.

39:13.030 --> 39:15.231
Sir...
Oh, and one more thing.

39:15.266 --> 39:17.211
Don't ever take credit
for how I turned out. Okay?

39:17.235 --> 39:20.669
Any good in me was despite
having you as a father.

39:20.705 --> 39:23.505
Let's go.

39:28.946 --> 39:30.824
I know this was hard,
but you did the right thing.

39:32.583 --> 39:34.550
Did I?

39:34.585 --> 39:36.396
I put a call over to my friend
at the State Department.

39:36.420 --> 39:37.786
He just got back to me.

39:37.822 --> 39:39.288
They don't know
who this kid is.

39:39.323 --> 39:41.056
That's not your dad's son.

39:47.164 --> 39:49.698
Can I get my friend a burger
over here, please?

39:49.734 --> 39:51.800
Come on, I'm good. Really.
Double cheese.

39:51.836 --> 39:54.370
Okay. Maybe a shake?
Two milkshakes.

40:00.111 --> 40:02.411
Knock-knock. How are you?

40:02.446 --> 40:04.880
Cam wants you to sign off
on this forensic report.

40:07.718 --> 40:10.085
Thank you. You're free
to go for the evening.

40:10.121 --> 40:12.588
Have a good night.

40:12.623 --> 40:14.823
Actually, before you do,

40:14.859 --> 40:18.127
earlier you critiqued my work
as lacking perspicacity.

40:18.162 --> 40:20.229
Perhaps I was a bit too harsh.

40:20.264 --> 40:23.265
I assure you, my
skin is quite thick,

40:23.301 --> 40:24.633
in the metaphorical sense.

40:24.669 --> 40:28.370
However, the word choice
triggered a memory.

40:28.406 --> 40:32.741
Years ago, my editor sent me
stories written by readers

40:32.777 --> 40:35.477
in the style of my books--
fan fiction.

40:35.513 --> 40:37.446
Oh, fan fiction. Yeah.

40:37.481 --> 40:38.914
Most of them were
quite terrible.

40:38.950 --> 40:41.750
But one story at least
got the science right.

40:41.786 --> 40:45.321
It was called "The
Perspicacity in the Bones."

40:45.356 --> 40:46.522
That's ironic.

40:46.557 --> 40:48.891
Memorably bad title.

40:48.926 --> 40:53.662
The plot centered around
a tormented intern who...

40:53.698 --> 40:55.030
Had an affair with his boss.

40:55.066 --> 40:56.498
Uh, Dr. Brennan...

40:56.534 --> 40:58.467
...if I may...

40:58.502 --> 41:01.070
I ran a computer analysis...
No, you didn't.

41:01.105 --> 41:03.005
of the prose
from that story

41:03.040 --> 41:06.275
with work you've
written for me.

41:06.310 --> 41:08.143
The result was conclusive.

41:08.179 --> 41:09.378
Yeah.

41:09.413 --> 41:11.480
You've not only
read my novels,

41:11.515 --> 41:14.350
but you were once
a devoted fan of them.

41:14.385 --> 41:17.219
You're gonna tell Angela and
Hodgins about this, aren't you?

41:17.254 --> 41:18.954
That would be
needlessly cruel.

41:18.990 --> 41:20.189
Thank you.

41:20.224 --> 41:21.991
I think it's enough
for us to know

41:22.026 --> 41:25.894
that despite your
apathetic affectations,

41:25.930 --> 41:29.465
there are things in this
world that bring you joy.

41:32.970 --> 41:37.206
I am in a hell of my own making.

41:44.315 --> 41:46.515
Hey, Bones,
you're just in time.

41:46.550 --> 41:47.961
Christine, she's brushing her
teeth and getting ready for bed.

41:47.985 --> 41:50.419
Excellent. How's Aubrey?

41:50.454 --> 41:53.055
Oh, he'll be okay, he's fine.
He's already 12 doughnuts in.

41:53.090 --> 41:54.401
Listen, I've been thinking.
I think it's great that you're

41:54.425 --> 41:56.258
sending in your audition tape.

41:56.293 --> 41:57.971
You know what? You're-you're
challenging yourself.

41:57.995 --> 42:01.897
Actually, I destroyed it.
What? Why?

42:01.932 --> 42:05.000
As an author,
I can read my audience,

42:05.036 --> 42:08.537
and everything I need to know
about my future as a voice actor

42:08.572 --> 42:11.106
was evident
in Aubrey's demeanor today.

42:11.142 --> 42:13.609
Oh, that kid's got
no poker face.

42:13.644 --> 42:15.511
Besides, someone else
reminded me

42:15.546 --> 42:19.415
that my work has already
touched many people,

42:19.450 --> 42:20.949
no matter how you read it.

42:20.985 --> 42:23.318
Speaking of which,
all right,

42:23.354 --> 42:25.621
there's a big fan of yours
in the back room there

42:25.656 --> 42:27.823
that would love to hear
a reading from you.

42:27.858 --> 42:29.058
Oh, you think?

42:29.093 --> 42:30.559
For sure.

42:30.594 --> 42:33.762
Really? Well, if I start
with my latest novel,

42:33.798 --> 42:36.432
that might be too confusing.

42:36.467 --> 42:37.966
Maybe my first book.

42:38.002 --> 42:39.442
Whoa. Wait a second.
Are you serious?

42:39.470 --> 42:40.947
That's a little dark
for a six-year-old.

42:40.971 --> 42:42.071
No. My plots are no darker

42:42.106 --> 42:43.605
than your average
fairy tale.

42:43.641 --> 42:45.641
Bones, you're talking about
brutal murders here.

42:45.676 --> 42:47.443
In the original <i>Cinderella,</i>

42:47.478 --> 42:50.813
two doves peck the eyes out
of the stepsisters.

42:50.848 --> 42:52.125
I don't remember that
in the movie.

42:52.149 --> 42:53.493
Well, it's in
the original short story,

42:53.517 --> 42:54.795
which I've already read her.
What?

42:54.819 --> 42:56.685
Okay. Don't judge me, Booth.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.821
When I described the
pecking out of the eyes,

42:58.856 --> 43:00.322
I did so in a
tasteful manner.

43:00.357 --> 43:02.037
Tasteful? There's
nothing tasteful about...
