[Woman ]
Here at the American
Heritage Museum,

00:19.687 --> 00:22.099
one word is crucial
when leading tours—

00:22.190 --> 00:24.397
C-R-A-B. CRAB.

00:24.483 --> 00:27.941
Communicate, Respond, Adjust
and, above all, Be prepared.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.520
Tourists will ask
stupid questions.

00:30.615 --> 00:32.446
You W/7/ know
how to answer them.

00:32.575 --> 00:33.610
[ Gasps ]
Miss Tillotson.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.612
- Do not interrupt.
- But—

00:35.703 --> 00:39.195
No, Lincoln did not do
his homework on the back
of a shovel with a lump of coal.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.952
- No, he did not walk a mile—
- [ Gasping]

00:47.381 --> 00:48.791
Oh, dear God.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.674
Right. Okay.
Great. Thanks.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.428
They’ve cordoned off the museum.
The less the press knows about this,
the better. Trust me.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.055
So, any new listings?
Nothing that I would live in.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.232
Well, you know,
we’re runnin’ out
of time here, Bones.

01:08.319 --> 01:11.061
I mean, you’re due,
what, in six weeks?
We gotta find a house.

01:11.155 --> 01:14.113
Well, there is
a simple solution.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.940
No! Uh-uh.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.866
I need my man cave.

01:17.954 --> 01:19.785
Then I need
an anthropologist cave.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.113
So we need a man cave,
a girl cave...

01:22.208 --> 01:24.790
and a perfect baby’s room
with at least an acre of land.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.538
No wonder
we can’t find a house.

01:26.671 --> 01:28.627
Whoa.
[ lnhales ]
“Whoa” is right.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.545
“Whoa” what?
You all right?

01:30.633 --> 01:33.340
Whoo. She just kicked.
[ Laughs] She’s very strong.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.383
Okay. Let’s check
the listings again.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.346
I’m looking.
I just want to make sure
we didn’t miss anything.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.717
[ Police Rad/'0 Chatter]

01:42.812 --> 01:45.349
[Hodgins] I actually think
the Vatican was in on
the Lincoln assassination.

01:45.439 --> 01:50.524
They hated Lincoln since
he defended a former priest
against the Bishop of Chicago.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.476
All righty.
lt’s human blood.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.233
Yeah? Think it came from him?

01:55.324 --> 01:56.905
The serologist
will let us know.

01:56.993 --> 01:58.824
Look, all I’m saying
is that John Wilkes Booth...

01:58.911 --> 02:01.288
was secretly
a member of the Knights
of the Golden Circle,

02:01.372 --> 02:02.703
affiliated with Rome.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.782
Okay. Little friendly advice.
Do not mention Booth to Booth.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.958
They are related,
and he’ll shoot you.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.036
- What do we got here?
- Hi.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.040
[Saroyan ] The killer
left a message in blood—

02:14.135 --> 02:15.921
“Where’s the rest of me?”

02:16.012 --> 02:19.379
Well, I assume he’s referring
to the rest of the remains,

02:19.473 --> 02:21.259
because Lincoln seems intact.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.012
Do we have a time of death yet,
Dr. Hodgins?

02:24.103 --> 02:27.095
According to the blowfly eggs
in the orbital sockets,

02:27.189 --> 02:29.180
we’re looking at about two days.

02:37.033 --> 02:40.776
There is something very strange
about this vertebral column.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.360
[ Booth ]
Strange? How?

02:42.455 --> 02:45.913
The articulating vertebrae
all appear to be from
the same spine, but—

02:46.000 --> 02:47.911
They’re in the wrong order.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.709
A killer dissected out
the spine and separated
the vertebrae?

02:50.796 --> 02:52.002
Is that a big deal?

02:52.089 --> 02:55.297
It means detaching
all the intersegmental
ligaments,

02:55.384 --> 02:58.717
the anterior and posterior
longitudinal ligaments...

02:58.804 --> 03:00.214
and the supraspinous ligament,

03:00.306 --> 03:03.673
not to mention
somehow reattaching them.

03:03.768 --> 03:06.180
- Okay, that is a big deal.
- Absolutely.

03:06.270 --> 03:10.639
It seems the killer reassembled
the vertebrae out of order on purpose.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.773
He’s sending us a message.

03:53.943 --> 03:57.310
[Angela ] Looks like
some kind of deranged surgeon
sewed this back together.

03:57.405 --> 04:01.819
I mean, what is that?
Looks like some kind
of nasty string.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.865
l have a bad feeling
about this.

04:03.953 --> 04:06.786
But I will wait for
the electrophoresis results...

04:06.872 --> 04:08.032
to share it.

04:08.124 --> 04:10.115
Judging by the small skull
and the nuchal crest,

04:10.209 --> 04:12.450
the victim
was a female Caucasian.

04:12.545 --> 04:15.537
Her wisdom teeth
haven’t fully erupted,

04:15.631 --> 04:17.872
suggesﬂng
she was in her early 20s.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.839
[Beeps]
Okay.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.511
Bad feeling
officially confirmed.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.511
The “string” the killer used
is made out of human gut.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.226
[ Device Beeps ]

04:31.313 --> 04:33.269
Serology results just came in.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.814
The message the killer left—
“Where is the rest of me?”

04:35.901 --> 04:38.734
Why are you looking at us
like that, Mr. Bray?
Spit it out.

04:38.821 --> 04:40.607
They ran
the usual A.B.O. groups,

04:40.698 --> 04:42.438
plus enzyme
and protein markers.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.489
And?

04:44.577 --> 04:47.910
The blood at the scene
isn’t from the victim.
It’s from five other people.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.826
- Five different people?
- Yeah.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.249
Call the lab,
tell them we need D.N.A.
Tag it a priority.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.873
And if anyone gives you grief,
tell them to refer to me.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.175
- [ Sweets ] Exterminators
treated the museum last night?
- [ Booth ] Yeah.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.344
Looks like our killer
used a laser pointer...

05:05.431 --> 05:07.342
to burn out the image
on one of
the security cameras.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.300
See that? The camera
goes out there at 5:51.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.555
Okay, so the killer
leaves the remains,

05:12.646 --> 05:15.228
writes the message,
gets out before
anyone can spot him.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.524
Right. So we have
one confirmed dead
and, what, five maybes?

05:18.611 --> 05:21.648
What kind of nutbag
does that?

05:21.739 --> 05:25.106
Well, defacing an iconic
American figure...

05:25.201 --> 05:27.533
suggests that he craves
attention, right?

05:27.620 --> 05:30.657
And he demands we engage
by posing two mysteries.

05:30.748 --> 05:33.205
One, for the public—
“Where’s the rest of me?”

05:33.292 --> 05:36.375
And a more private mystery
for us— the reordered spine.

05:36.462 --> 05:39.169
If he has something to say,
why doesn’t he just say it?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.337
It’s very manipulative,
uh, meaning high |.Q.,

05:44.428 --> 05:47.215
which is consistent with the fact
that he was able to dissect a spine.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.092
Which tells us
he’s comfortable killing people.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.673
Yeah.
Practice makes perfect.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.759
It’s likely that
he has prior offenses.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.764
[ Phone Rings]

05:54.855 --> 05:56.356

05:57.775 --> 05:59.185
Yeah.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.608
You got a name?

06:02.363 --> 06:04.695
Right. Great. Thanks.

06:04.782 --> 06:08.366
So, one of the guys
on the exterminator crew
has a felony record—

06:08.452 --> 06:10.568
by the name of Sam Sachs.

06:10.663 --> 06:12.824
Okay, we got
the C1 vertebra,

06:12.915 --> 06:16.248
T9, C2, C5 and then the T1,

06:16.335 --> 06:19.543
but with both transverse
processes removed.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.791
Why are we writing
all this down again?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.874
Because the killer
did not reorder 24
articulating vertebrae...

06:24.969 --> 06:26.379
just for kicks and giggles.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.381
And that makes this
some kind of cipher,

06:28.472 --> 06:30.383
which means I need
the order written down...

06:30.474 --> 06:33.011
before you go
running the bony bits
through the wash cycle.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.184
Okay, continuing. T7.

06:35.271 --> 06:38.434
I’m telling you,
my grandfather would
expect me to know what to do.

06:38.524 --> 06:41.561
Did I ever tell you
that he was a code breaker
back in World War II? Huh?

Worked for Admiral Nimitz.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.647
Mine worked for Colonel Chicken.

06:46.699 --> 06:48.439
What? It’s kind of military.
He had a uniform.

06:51.078 --> 06:56.243
The C4 also has the right
transverse process removed.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.540
It all means something.

to figure out what.

You have quite a record here—

07:12.516 --> 07:14.723
Maybe one of
these guys out there
got some nicotine gum.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.971
No.

07:17.062 --> 07:20.520
Also says here that
you graduated to a couple pops
for violent assault.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.974
Now, that’s what we call
a pattern of escalation.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.396
Pattern of what?
Escalation, Sam.

to get worse and worse.

07:27.573 --> 07:30.110
Okay. Maybe I made
a couple bad moves.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.579
glitched out security cameras
without getting caught on film,

08:19.667 --> 08:22.283
so he definitely knew
of a blind spot.

Look, the blood at the scene
clearly indicates...

he was targeting the FBI.

“Artistic bungalow

Bottom line is, given your condition,
I don’t think that
you should be out in the field.

10:57.866 --> 11:01.233
If the positive adjectives
indicate irreparable flaws,

of a growing fetus,

11:40.742 --> 11:44.109
I will focus on the lab
and the real estate section.

[ Hodgins ]
We know these vertebrae
are some kind of code.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.247

This is crazy.

a government thing, Ange.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.094
Okay. All right.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.645
What about the total number
of characters?
Does that help any?

12:12.733 --> 12:16.066
Well, there’s 48 total
if you count letters
and numbers that repeat,

12:16.153 --> 12:18.018
and 13 if you don’t.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.445
So, what has 13 digits?

12:20.532 --> 12:22.568
An |.S.B.N. number.

What if it’s a book?
What if there’s
a message in a book?

12:25.621 --> 12:28.738
No. Three of the characters
are letters, and l.S.B.N.’s
are just numbers.

12:28.832 --> 12:33.792
We could group the numbers
according to strings
that have the same letters.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.710
Maybe.
Okay.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.958
You’re guessing now,

a different encryption key.

There is no point
in him saying something
unless we can hear it,

12:53.899 --> 12:56.106

has to be simple.

to the museum and found
the security cam blind spot...

was talking about.

Yeah. The guy,
he completely MacGyver—ed it.

13:29.977 --> 13:33.686

and the switch is from a toaster.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.043
What do you mean, “Oh”?

implies all the potential problems.

14:06.304 --> 14:09.637
According to
the isotope profile
from her tooth enamel,

14:09.725 --> 14:11.306
the victim grew up
in Denmark.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.759

I found a particulate embedded
in the anterior aspect
of the T4.

14:27.909 --> 14:31.652
There are also
hairline fractures
on the neural arches.

14:31.747 --> 14:35.035
That could be consistent
with a high-velocity injury.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.207
Maybe a gunshot.
It could be a bullet fragment.

14:37.294 --> 14:40.036
A bullet wouldn’t
explain the pitting
on the vertebral body.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.837
Unless it shattered a rib
into smaller projectiles.

These are all of the bones
that you scanned
into the computer?

32:17.228 --> 32:21.187
Yeah. Wendell swears
there’s no microchips.
Nothing.

32:22.316 --> 32:23.772
There’s a roughness.

32:23.901 --> 32:26.438
Is it pitting
from the fatal explosion?
I don’t think so.

32:26.529 --> 32:29.521
Hand me the bottle
of the edicol dye
and a brush.

32:40.668 --> 32:43.330
- Oh, my God.
- What?

32:43.420 --> 32:46.207
It’s some kind
of fractal pattern.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.456
Whoever did this...

32:48.551 --> 32:50.633
wrote malware on bone that—

32:50.719 --> 32:53.210
that took down a million bucks
worth of computers.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.466
Who would know
how to do that?

32:55.558 --> 32:59.096
A computer genius
who wants us to know that
he doesn’t need a computer.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.926
Pelant.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.273
But he has
an ankle monitor.

33:03.357 --> 33:06.224
I’m telling you,
this guy is a genius.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.864
Man walking his dog
spotted him
about an hour ago.

33:13.993 --> 33:17.201
Whoa.
I wanted you
to get the full effect.

33:17.288 --> 33:20.951
Okay, lower it down.
Slowly. Gently.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.699
Gently.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.494
Wow.

33:27.590 --> 33:30.081
Okay, let me guess.
Security cameras
were disabled?

33:30.176 --> 33:32.337
You got it.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.214
Okay. You got him?

33:34.305 --> 33:36.045
[ Exhales ]

33:38.601 --> 33:40.592
Careful. Careful.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.137
[ Booth ]
He’s got no face.

33:44.231 --> 33:45.846
Oh!
Ohh.

33:45.941 --> 33:50.810
Oh, powder burns
at the base of the skull
are consistent with a bang stick.

33:50.905 --> 33:52.941
Same thing
that killed Inger Johannsen.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.398
Check his pockets,
will ya.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.952
Ezra Krane.

34:04.043 --> 34:08.878
This is not the outcome
l was hoping for exactly.

34:08.964 --> 34:12.206
- How long has he been dead?
- Still warm. Less than four hours.

34:12.301 --> 34:15.964
Someone really
didn’t want Ezra Krane
to reveal his source.

34:16.055 --> 34:18.922
Let’s make sure
we get secure transportation
for this body.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.677
Well, we have fresh remains.

34:22.019 --> 34:24.010
Whoever did this,
we’ll get him.

34:29.526 --> 34:32.734
This is ridiculous.
The body left the scene
over two hours ago.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.779
I watched it get loaded
onto the coroner’s van myself.

34:35.866 --> 34:38.073
Should I call Caroline again?

34:38.160 --> 34:39.616
You’ve already
called her twice.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.911
I got some very strange results
back on the skull wound swab.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.954
There’s traces
of thorium dioxide.

34:45.042 --> 34:49.877
It’s used in heat-resistant
ceramics like gas lamps
and old vacuum tubes.

34:49.964 --> 34:52.751
The same kind
of vacuum tubes
they use in old computers?

34:52.841 --> 34:55.048
Actually, yeah,
now that you mention it.

34:55.135 --> 34:57.626
Didn’t Booth say that Pelant
had an old computer?

34:57.721 --> 35:00.098
Yes, but he’s also
got that ankle monitor.

35:00.182 --> 35:02.594
The killer made a cipher
out of spine.

35:02.685 --> 35:04.550
And he wrote malware
on bone...

35:04.645 --> 35:08.058
and— and killed
two people with blanks
and a curtain rod.

35:08.148 --> 35:10.013
I think he can get around
an ankle monitor.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.191
Pelant did this, Cam.
He did it.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.563
Call Dr. Brennan.

35:14.655 --> 35:17.567
Your body won’t be
arriving anytime soon.

35:17.658 --> 35:18.943
Why?

35:19.034 --> 35:22.447
The coroner’s van
left the scene
with a Metro P.D. escort.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.995
But they got a radio call
ordering them...

35:25.082 --> 35:27.118
to reroute to the medical
examiner’s office...

35:27.209 --> 35:31.919
where there was papenNork
ordering the body transferred
to DC. Memorial.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.713
D.C. Memorial
also had paperwork.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.462
Only theirs said that
the autopsy was complete...

35:37.553 --> 35:40.010
and that infectious tissue
was found.

35:40.097 --> 35:42.679
Oh, my God.
The protocol.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.631
What? What protocol?

35:44.727 --> 35:46.308
Once autopsies are complete,

35:46.395 --> 35:50.604
bodies with infectious tissue
are cremated as medical waste.

35:50.691 --> 35:53.057
A set of orders was passed down
through channels...

35:53.193 --> 35:58.153
that even the Almighty himself
would need an atlas and
a double shot of bourbon to navigate.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.741
He thinks
he’s smarter than us.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.190
He may be right.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.575
I don’t know anyone
smarter than I am.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.998
Well, they didn’t
say that he was,
just that he might be.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.541
Okay?

36:11.628 --> 36:13.835
Pelant’s parole officer’s
bringing him in, which is good.

36:13.922 --> 36:17.710
He’s resourceful.
That doesn’t make him
smarter than I am.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.178
Primitive hunters
were resourceful.

36:20.262 --> 36:24.255
Oh, he did manage to get
gunpowder for his bang stick
without leaving tracks.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.715
That’s pretty resourceful.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.219
He could’ve used
putrefied urine.

36:27.311 --> 36:29.427
It’s an excellent source
of potassium nitrate.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.931
Right.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.934
So you’re saying
that sometimes
something that stinks...

36:33.025 --> 36:37.485
has the potential to be
turned into something,
I don’t know, valuable?

36:38.822 --> 36:42.610
Are you talking about
putrefied urine
or a mighty hut?

36:43.660 --> 36:44.820
Both.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.087
A lot of trouble
carting that thing in here.

36:54.171 --> 36:55.661
Why’d you do that,
Agent Booth?

36:55.756 --> 36:58.463
My guys took a look.
Turns out there’s
a vacuum tube missing.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.212
Yeah? That’s a drag.
It’s gonna be tough to replace.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.510
Especially since
I can’t get on line.

37:03.597 --> 37:06.589
That seems like a pretty minor
obstacle for a man who can
write a computer virus on bone.

37:06.683 --> 37:10.267
Mmm. No, not virus.
The word you’re looking for is “worm.”

37:10.354 --> 37:11.719
It’s a common mistake.

37:11.814 --> 37:13.304
So you don’t deny it?

37:14.900 --> 37:19.109
This sends a signal every 38 seconds
to the monitoring company.

37:19.196 --> 37:22.359
And the records will show
that I never left my house.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.280
I talked to them.
He’s right.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.484
You can charge me.
You can charge me.

37:26.620 --> 37:30.363
But what jury is gonna believe
I killed a girl, cut her up,
then dumped her in the museum—

37:30.457 --> 37:32.698
all in 38 seconds?

37:33.836 --> 37:35.747
You did it,
but you couldn’t
have done it.

37:35.838 --> 37:38.420
It’s quantum
indeterminacy.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.418
I knew you’d say that.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.420
l have a lot of time
on my hands,

37:42.511 --> 37:45.218
so I’ve read all the court transcripts
where you guys give testimony.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.341
You are not gonna
get away with this, pal.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.969
Actually, it kinda
looks like he is.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.266
It’s the giant flaw in our system.

37:51.353 --> 37:54.937
Trying to make the system secure,
we make it more complex.

37:55.023 --> 37:59.733
But the more complex we make it,
the more insecure we actually are.

37:59.820 --> 38:02.983
Well, it turns out
I’m not a complex guy.

38:03.073 --> 38:07.567
I’m a simple guy,
and simple guys always
take down guys like you.

38:09.329 --> 38:11.365

he’s ready to go.
