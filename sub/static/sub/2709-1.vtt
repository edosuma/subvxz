01:16.356 --> 01:18.520
Best place we went to
since we've been here.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.897
Definitely, man.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.690
- Way to go, buddy.
- Brother.

01:21.790 --> 01:25.384
- You guys coming back to my place?
- All right. Let's go.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.014
Hey!

01:30.549 --> 01:34.143
Shame, shame.
Closing down the beer garden.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.897
Hundred-meter dash powered
by knackwurst and lager.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.108
Where are you guys from?

01:42.186 --> 01:44.153
What's your event?

01:45.856 --> 01:47.990
They don't speak English, man.

01:49.526 --> 01:53.097
- Let's help them over.
- Come on. Up?

01:53.197 --> 01:54.747
Here you go.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.209
Let's go. I got you. Come on.

01:59.912 --> 02:03.005
Up. Yeah. All right?

02:07.920 --> 02:10.346
- You guys take care.
- See you.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.826
- Take it easy.
- See you.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.828
You're taking the grade tomorrow.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.937
Watch yourself, man.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.010
I'm Jim McKay speaking to you live...

03:55.110 --> 03:57.554
at this moment, from ABC headquarters...

03:57.654 --> 04:00.849
just outside the Olympic village
in Munich, West Germany.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.894
The peace of what have been
called the "serene Olympics"...

04:03.994 --> 04:07.838
was shattered just before dawn
this morning, about 5:00.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.193
There is great uncertainty
about how many Israelis...

04:11.293 --> 04:13.529
are being held hostage in the apartment.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.406
It now appears that Black September
has tossed a piece of paper...

04:16.505 --> 04:18.784
out the window. A list of demands.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.452
They want what they call
"the Israeli war machine"...

04:21.553 --> 04:25.374
to release 200 Arabs,
which it insists are political prisoners...

04:25.474 --> 04:28.025
or the hostages will be killed.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.087
The terrorist communiqué
ends with an appeal...

04:30.187 --> 04:33.614
for revolutionaries
of the world to unite.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.743
This is building number 31.
At this moment...

04:38.195 --> 04:41.306
eight or nine terrified
living human beings...

04:41.406 --> 04:43.267
are being held prisoner.

04:43.367 --> 04:47.104
The demands have been many...
There's someone right now.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.481
This certainly has to be
one of the guerrillas.

04:49.581 --> 04:53.151
A man with a stocking mask
on his face. Weird.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.988
What's going on inside
that head and that mind?

04:56.088 --> 04:57.948
Just a short while ago, there was...

04:58.048 --> 05:00.951
another in this long series
of negotiations.

05:01.051 --> 05:05.581
The spokesman for the group
came out, spoke, went back.

05:05.681 --> 05:09.334
It seems to be a process
of speak and consultation.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.296
Does it mean it's all right?
Or does it mean it's all over?

05:12.396 --> 05:13.839
Come and get us.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.592
As Peter Jennings indicated,
the German army...

05:16.692 --> 05:20.220
because of very complicated laws...

05:20.320 --> 05:22.014
would not be allowed to participate.

05:22.114 --> 05:25.309
And there you see an athlete
holding a canvas bag...

05:25.409 --> 05:27.394
in which is obviously a machine gun.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.313
Peter Jennings,
once again, is stationed...

05:29.413 --> 05:31.648
inside the Olympic village.
With the naked eye, Peter...

05:31.748 --> 05:33.150
what do you see now?

05:33.250 --> 05:36.111
Jim, there are now a great many...

05:36.211 --> 05:39.698
maybe a dozen already,
of those security men...

05:39.798 --> 05:42.349
in athletic uniforms.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.829
Stop!

06:04.573 --> 06:07.017
It now appears that the siege
of the apartment building...

06:07.117 --> 06:09.186
where the hostages are being
held has been called off...

06:09.286 --> 06:11.188
and the German police are
retreating from the area.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.273
Officials seem to have decided
to abandon their plans...

06:13.373 --> 06:15.525
when the leader of the fedayeen
came out of the building...

06:15.625 --> 06:18.779
and demanded they call off the siege
pointing out that the entire operation...

06:18.879 --> 06:21.156
was being watched on a television set
within the apartment.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.533
Apparently, new demands have
been made to move the fedayeen...

06:23.633 --> 06:25.702
and their hostages,
though it isn't yet known...

06:25.802 --> 06:27.329
when or where this might occur.

06:27.429 --> 06:31.291
This is Peter. Do you have something
to report to us from where you are?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.961
This is Cosell. I certainly do, Peter.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.089
We have an immense
flurry of action here.

06:37.189 --> 06:41.843
Suddenly, in the whole area between
building 20 and building 12...

06:41.943 --> 06:43.971
they have been clearing out cars.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.099
Obviously wary of an assault
from the German police...

07:01.296 --> 07:02.698
within five minutes.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.366
What I'm hearing from here is that...

07:04.466 --> 07:08.161
they're heading to an airport
called Fürstenfeldbruck.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.705
...says the chopper just landed...

07:09.805 --> 07:11.081
at the back of the Olympic village here.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.916
Can you see gate number seven?

07:13.016 --> 07:15.752
This is Vance Kolvig.
What I have seen are...

07:15.852 --> 07:18.588
four hostages in one helicopter...

07:18.688 --> 07:21.967
and it looks like five hostages
in the first helicopter.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.927
Yes, I just got back
a little while ago...

07:24.027 --> 07:26.096
and it was obvious that something...

07:26.196 --> 07:27.514
quite serious was going on out there.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.017
Here we are, outside the gates.
There are armored cars...

07:30.117 --> 07:31.101
police cars...

07:32.369 --> 07:34.646
Police are pouring in through
the gates with lights flashing...

07:34.746 --> 07:36.982
and here come some more.
Five, six, here comes another one.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.401
Seven armored cars have gone
in through the gates now.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.153
They're mounting a major invasion.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.572
The latest word we get
from the airport is that...

07:43.672 --> 07:46.181
quote, "all hell has
broken loose out there."

08:02.399 --> 08:04.301
It's just arrived, Peter.
The bus has arrived...

08:04.401 --> 08:06.470
- to the helicopters.
- We have reports now...

08:06.570 --> 08:10.539
that all the hostages,
all nine hostages are safe.

08:10.657 --> 08:14.644
We repeat, we have confirmed,
it's just past 1:00 a.m.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.438
The fighting ceased at midnight.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.565
Well, that's at least 24
we've seen go in...

08:18.665 --> 08:20.150
and now we can see
the lights flashing...

08:20.250 --> 08:22.861
There was a terrible battle at
the airport, but the hostages...

08:22.961 --> 08:25.489
somehow the hostages are safe.

08:25.589 --> 08:28.075
And, according to these reports,
all Arab terrorists...

08:28.175 --> 08:29.868
have died by German gunfire.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.996
Originally it was said that
the hostages were safe...

08:33.096 --> 08:35.164
but now that has been changed.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.417
An Olympic spokesman said that...

08:37.517 --> 08:39.503
Of the areas in the world,
this is one of the areas...

08:45.442 --> 08:47.344
They've spent their youth,
their young people...

08:47.444 --> 08:48.845
they've spent all their money on wars.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.640
Now they have a chance to build
their nations. These nations...

08:51.740 --> 08:54.309
And, of course, they're compatible.
The Arabs and the Israelis...

08:54.409 --> 08:56.186
are perfectly compatible
as far as I can tell.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.105
And now, as you say,
Peter, you're quite right.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.398
They've been jolted apart again,
as they were...

09:00.498 --> 09:03.360
seeming to come just a little closer.
Little hope.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.862
We've just gotten the final word.
When I was a kid...

09:05.962 --> 09:08.532
my father used to say our greatest
hopes and our worst fears...

09:08.632 --> 09:12.119
are seldom realized. Our worst
fears have been realized tonight.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.038
They've now said that
there were 11 hostages.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.940
Two were killed in their rooms...

09:18.558 --> 09:20.377
yesterday morning.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.881
Nine were killed at the airport tonight.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.865
They're all gone.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.886
...before a quiet crowd of 80,000.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.097
After the ceremony,
the surviving team...

09:32.197 --> 09:34.182
saw the coffins of their
fallen comrades...

09:34.282 --> 09:37.018
loaded onto an airplane to
bring them home together.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.688
Enormous crowds also gathered
on Dizengoff Street...

09:39.788 --> 09:43.233
and in Jerusalem on the plaza
in front of the Knesset.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.944
People are weeping,
tearing their clothes.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.738
The funerals, which will be
held tomorrow in Jerusalem...

09:48.838 --> 09:51.700
are expected to draw tens
of thousands of mourners.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.244
These are the names of the
members of the Israeli team...

09:54.344 --> 09:56.621
at the Munich Olympics,
who were held hostage...

09:56.721 --> 10:00.315
beaten, and finally murdered
by Arab terrorists.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.442
Yosef Gottfreund.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.588
Eliezaar Halfen.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.613
Yakov Springer.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.741
Dr. Wadi Haddad.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.743
Abu Daoud.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.263
Mahmoud Hamshari.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.205
Andre Spitzer.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.374
Zeev Friedman.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.852
Kehat Schur.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.711
Wael Zwaiter.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.088
Dr. Basil al-Kubaisi.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.566
Kamal Nasser.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.508
Mark Slavin.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.552
Amitzur Shapira.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.679
David Berger.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.556
Kemal Adwan.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.850
Abu Youssef.

10:34.968 --> 10:35.952
Mohammed Boudia.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.704
Yosef Romano.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.479
Moshe Weinberg.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.249
Hussein al-Chir.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.275
Ali Hassan Salameh.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.883
As all of Israel mourns,
of course everyone says prayers...

10:49.983 --> 10:50.967
for the people...

10:51.067 --> 10:53.887
I tried not to think about you,
but I couldn't.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.974
...a very private, terrible grief
in the days and years to come.

10:58.074 --> 11:02.395
I have the world's most boring job.
What's going to happen to me?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.023
Well, they were just athletes.
They went to the Olympics.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.382
Look what happened to them.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.386
What now?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.224
Now we're going to have a baby.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.395
Eleven names.

11:20.638 --> 11:24.066
Give us the order, and we'll begin.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.863
It's the same as Eichmann.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.342
We say to these butchers:

11:32.442 --> 11:34.261
"You didn't want to share
this world with us...

11:34.361 --> 11:37.079
"then we don't have to
share this world with you."

11:38.448 --> 11:41.541
There's legitimacy for this.
Am I correct?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.172
Ambushed and slaughtered again...

11:48.833 --> 11:52.279
while the rest of the world is
playing games, Olympic torches...

11:52.379 --> 11:55.472
and brass bands
and dead Jews in Germany.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.867
And the world couldn't care less.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.036
We've responded.
We sent 70 fighter jets.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.288
A response no one heard.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.915
Air strikes on guerrilla training centers.
That's a response.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.917
No one notices what happens
in the border camps.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.712
Sixty Arabs dead, at least.
Who knows how many wounded.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.214
This is about fixing
the world's attention.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.967
Well, it's not just a publicity stunt.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.992
Let me remind you.

12:16.152 --> 12:20.307
Ali Hassan Salameh,
he invented Black September.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.458
He is the architect
of the Munich murders.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.211
These people.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.172
They're sworn to destroy us.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.510
Forget peace for now.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.471
We have to show them we're strong.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.100
We have laws, we represent civilization.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.121
Some people say we can't
afford to be civilized.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.856
I've always resisted such people.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.002
But I don't know
who these maniacs are...

12:49.102 --> 12:51.403
and where they come from.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.114
Palestinians?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.491
They're not recognizable.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.873
You tell me what law
protects people like these.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.462
Today I'm hearing with new ears.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.192
Every civilization finds it necessary...

13:12.292 --> 13:16.344
to negotiate compromises
with its own values.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.742
I've made a decision.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.602
The responsibility is entirely mine.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.380
- Avner?
- Yes?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.114
We're going to Jerusalem. Get in.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.534
Come on, sir.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.188
Hello. I'm General Zamir.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.671
Yes.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.650
You swore us in.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.944
My unit, when I joined Mossad.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.094
I don't remember you.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.515
Of course, I know your father.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.734
Avner.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.549
- It's been...
- Two years since I worked for you.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.492
I remember. Please, sit down.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.078
Harari.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.413
General Nadav.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.791
And General Yariv.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.520
How are you? How is your father?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.671
He's fine. Thank you.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.444
Coffee? It's wonderful to see you again.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.927
Sit.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.825
The chief of the Mossad, two generals...

14:43.925 --> 14:46.977
and the Prime Minister.
Obviously, it's important.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.291
This is something new.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.150
What happened in Munich
changes everything.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.990
We want to ask you.
Will you undertake a mission?

15:00.441 --> 15:03.595
An important mission.
You will have to leave the country...

15:03.695 --> 15:05.972
and your family, maybe for years.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.975
- And it is dangerous.
- You can't talk about it to anyone.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.001
Not even your wife.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.008
Now you should say something.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.136
Do you have any questions?

15:22.964 --> 15:26.600
So, this isn't about guarding
tourists on El Al jets?

15:28.970 --> 15:30.687
No questions?

15:30.888 --> 15:33.648
Did we mention how dangerous it is?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.651
You know, my sister died on Tuesday.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.255
- No, I didn't know that.
- Cancer.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.758
I couldn't go to
the athletes' funerals...

15:41.858 --> 15:43.658
because she died.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.079
That upset people,
but she was my sister.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.166
Family matters.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.900
- Your wife is pregnant.
- Yes, seven months.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.508
Mazel tov.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.279
You were one of my favorite bodyguards.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.389
You know, I like neat, durable men.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.726
You liked having the son
of a hero around.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.040
Truth be told,
you don't look much like your father.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.565
No?

16:17.393 --> 16:20.028
Your mother is who you resemble.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.548
Tomorrow morning.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.468
If you can't decide in one day...

16:44.045 --> 16:45.929
you can't decide.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.958
Her sister died.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.627
But I think she didn't go
to the athletes' funerals...

16:59.727 --> 17:01.379
because some people are angry at her...

17:01.479 --> 17:04.406
for not negotiating with the terrorists.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.348
She didn't go to the funerals...

17:13.449 --> 17:15.685
because she didn't want to be booed.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.104
It's a good sign
you didn't ask questions.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.564
You'll say yes.

17:19.664 --> 17:23.174
I'm your case officer.
My name is Ephraim.

17:48.609 --> 17:52.704
How late in the pregnancy before
you have to stop having sex?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.291
Labor.

18:10.006 --> 18:13.099
Don't worry about it.
You won't be around.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.186
Will you?

18:18.473 --> 18:20.958
Whatever they want,
make sure they give you a raise.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.378
I need things for the baby.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.987
I can't live with refusing this.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.658
Your mother,
she knew what she was doing.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.596
- She abandoned you on that kibbutz.
- She didn't abandon me.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.098
My father was missing.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.517
He was in prison, she was overwhelmed.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.478
- Oh, yes.
- She did what anybody would do.

18:40.578 --> 18:44.172
Yeah, so she took you to the
kibbutz and abandoned you.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.550
Now you think Israel is your mother.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.850
So listen.

18:56.719 --> 19:00.021
I'm going to go along with this,
until I don't.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.317
- Do you understand me?
- I love you.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.864
I'm not the hero's nice wife.

19:15.738 --> 19:20.166
First you resign from Mossad.
Your new contract.

19:21.035 --> 19:24.021
It says we do not employ you,
offer you benefits, or pensions...

19:24.121 --> 19:26.816
or legal aid or medical assistance.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.968
It's a contract that
there is no contract.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.321
- Do I get a copy?
- You don't.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.056
Your pension contribution refund.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.452
You're now officially unofficial.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.811
Unemployed and uninsured.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.623
You'll open two accounts...

19:42.723 --> 19:45.001
at the Union de
Banques Suisse in Geneva...

19:45.101 --> 19:46.544
on Rue du Commerce.

19:46.644 --> 19:50.173
Operational funds in one box,
in the other your salary...

19:50.273 --> 19:52.425
which you don't take
till the mission ends...

19:52.525 --> 19:54.177
when you get what accumulates.

19:54.277 --> 19:57.096
Also, for each of your men,
you open an account for his salary.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.184
- How many men do I have for this...
- In the operational funds box...

20:01.284 --> 20:05.378
we will deposit 250,000
American dollars.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.399
You take it out, we put more in.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.902
I want receipts.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.987
You are not working for
the Baron Rothschild.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.364
You're working for Israel,
a small country.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.951
I'm an old Galicianer from
a mud hut in the Ukraine.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.621
And I don't trust Yekke
putzes let loose in Europe...

20:21.721 --> 20:23.873
with unlimited operational expenses.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.375
I was born in Israel. I'm not a Yekke.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.444
- Where is your grandpa from?
- Frankfurt.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.422
You're a Yekke.

20:31.522 --> 20:35.843
Your wife receives monthly
$1,000 in her bank account.

20:35.943 --> 20:39.555
Also, we leave messages in the
box with the operational funds.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.623
You can leave messages for us.

20:42.450 --> 20:46.461
- But there shouldn't be messages.
- I don't care about that.

20:46.787 --> 20:50.775
- Bring me receipts, you got me?
- I got you.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.969
Whatever you are doing,
somebody else is paying for it.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.243
We have 11 Palestinian names.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.370
Each had a hand in planning Munich.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.248
You're going to kill them,
11 men, one by one.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.582
They're all in Europe now.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.125
You'll stay there as long as it takes.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.295
Europe only, not the Arab countries.
That's for us, not you.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.548
And not Eastern Bloc.
Don't upset the Russians.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.365
Who needs it?

21:16.150 --> 21:18.701
You'll have no contact with us.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.264
You're not going to
give me any information?

21:21.364 --> 21:23.766
We deposit money from a
fund that doesn't exist...

21:23.866 --> 21:26.936
into a box we don't know about,
in a bank we never set foot in.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.564
We can't help you because we
never heard of you before.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.315
You'll do what the terrorists do.

21:31.415 --> 21:35.009
You think they report back to home base?
They don't.

21:35.336 --> 21:37.220
We want them dead.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.199
Nothing better than eating
something sweet by the sea.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.159
You can ask questions now.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.453
- Am I alone?
- Four others.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.373
They know useful things
like cars, documents...

21:47.473 --> 21:48.749
cleanup to make sure you don't...

21:48.849 --> 21:49.959
accidentally drop your fake passport...

21:50.059 --> 21:53.194
next to the dead body.
You're the team leader.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.426
- Who kills the targets?
- You do. Who else?

21:58.526 --> 22:00.970
Use guns if you have to,
but the bombs are preferable.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.097
One of your guys knows how to make them.

22:03.197 --> 22:06.475
We want everyone to read in Le Monde
some famous Arab terrorist is dead.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.144
Who knows who blew him up?

22:08.244 --> 22:10.897
- Why me?
- So what's wrong with you?

22:10.997 --> 22:13.881
I'm not an experienced field operative.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.385
- So I'm not known.
- Not even I know you now.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.780
And also, I lived in Frankfurt
when I was a kid...

22:19.880 --> 22:22.158
so I'm a Yekke Jew who knows
his way around Europe.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.494
That's a good reason.
Here's one more. You're ordinary.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.580
You aren't a sabra Charles Bronson.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.373
- I am a sabra.
- I know.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.834
I know so much about you.
You're a nice sabra...

22:31.934 --> 22:34.962
with a dog and a baby on the way.
You won't shoot Spanish bellhops.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.006
No bellhops. No civilians.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.425
That kind of trouble we can't afford.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.886
The hard thing will not be finding them.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.013
Some of them, anyway,
are not so carefully hidden.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.515
The hard thing will be not
punishing yourselves...

22:46.615 --> 22:48.935
by getting caught or getting killed.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.687
- You want the last piece of baklava?
- No.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.898
Smart decision. You should avoid sweets.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.633
After all, you just signed away
your dental insurance.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.739
This is Pierre Bouchet,
your captain, speaking.

23:01.839 --> 23:05.409
Welcome aboard Flight
SA 74 direct to Geneva.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.788
We are now at a cruising
altitude of 30,000 feet...

23:08.888 --> 23:11.606
and we wish you a pleasant flight.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.654
Don't shoot. I don't understand
what you're saying.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.054
Easy, easy, easy.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.128
Press the buzzer when you're done.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.857
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.756
I'm not good at it. No.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.216
- Hebrew?
- No.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.427
A team leader who cooks. What a luxury.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.762
- Years in the kibbutz kitchen.
- You've done this before?

26:53.862 --> 26:55.222
Done what?

26:55.322 --> 26:57.164
Sit. Come on.

26:57.908 --> 27:01.502
Because I joined Mossad
10 minutes ago, and I'm...

27:02.871 --> 27:06.299
Look, I want to kill every one
of these pigs, but...

27:07.042 --> 27:08.235
Thank you.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.988
So, some of you have
training in this kind of...

27:11.088 --> 27:13.157
- He sells antiques.
- Right here in Frankfurt.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.034
It's a front, but successful.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.119
I'm a documents
and identities specialist...

27:17.219 --> 27:20.187
with a sharp eye
for early Danish Modern.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.231
And you?

27:22.599 --> 27:24.376
Oh, I make toys.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.862
- I thought you made bombs.
- Toys, in Brussels.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.573
For bombs, I had to go to night school.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.509
My wife's expecting.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.261
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.204
- Beautiful. When?
- Couple of months.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.291
Think we'll be done by then?

27:40.576 --> 27:43.377
Is it Ali Hassan Salameh we're after?

27:45.414 --> 27:47.923
I mean, that's the job, right?

27:48.083 --> 27:51.927
We're here to kill the guy who
planned Munich. Am I right?

27:54.298 --> 27:58.327
It's strange, isn't it, to think
of oneself as an assassin?

27:58.427 --> 28:00.829
Think of yourself
as something else then.

28:00.929 --> 28:05.691
- A soldier in a war.
- I mean, you know how to shoot...

28:06.393 --> 28:09.362
to assassinate people, right?

28:10.147 --> 28:11.840
Mazels on the baby, and all that.
That's great.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.575
That's just fantastic. But, I mean...

28:15.778 --> 28:18.412
You make dolls in a toy shop...

28:19.114 --> 28:22.583
and you shop for sofas...

28:22.701 --> 28:24.395
and you, I don't know what you do.

28:24.495 --> 28:27.004
Me? I worry.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.942
So, why'd they make you team leader?

28:30.042 --> 28:32.968
Because he really knows
how to cook a brisket.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.872
- Hello?
- Andreas.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.226
- Surprised?
- Surprised? You punched me.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.270
- You broke my jaw, man.
- That was 10 years ago.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.564
And you were sleeping
with my girlfriend.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.566
Listen, I'm in town. Are you around?

29:10.666 --> 29:12.443
Yeah, actually,
I'm here with my girlfriend.

29:12.543 --> 29:15.302
- Do you want to come over?
- Perfect.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.352
She's incredible, isn't she?

29:46.452 --> 29:49.462
I have no idea what she's talking about.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.558
I miss you, man.
We really used to love each other.

30:26.658 --> 30:30.127
That was a long time ago.
We were in high school.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.151
I have some names.

30:36.251 --> 30:40.054
Some people I need to find
for my rich American friends.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.518
Give me my money, Yvonne.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.689
- One hundred fifty.
- One hundred.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.084
Cash.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.109
$100,000.

30:57.481 --> 31:00.407
These people I'm looking for,
you don't know them.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.744
- We might.
- You don't.

31:04.947 --> 31:07.248
But maybe you know someone who does.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.668
And it's Americans you work for?

31:10.786 --> 31:12.920
Yes. See?

31:13.288 --> 31:15.089
James Madison.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.758
Americans.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.969
We'll ask some friends.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.031
Hiding? The Arabs are not hiding.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.534
- Munich was a big success for them.
- Oh?

31:25.634 --> 31:27.369
The implications of
Munich for the struggle...

31:27.469 --> 31:31.814
They got everyone's attention.
They're recruiting, making plans.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.024
Give me a few names.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.507
I can't help if I don't know
who you're trying to find.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.384
We'll have to trust.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.827
You have to cross the line.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.807
I trust you. You carry cash
and you don't make speeches.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.727
Nowadays, everyone makes speeches,
like your friend Andreas.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.794
Talk, talk, talk.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.130
Name me an Arab.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.510
Abu Daoud.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.304
Abu Youssef.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.306
Wael Zwaiter.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.808
Kamal Nasser.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.455
- Salameh.
- Forget Salameh. Too hard.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.416
Wait. Who are these guys?
Why are you trying to find Arabs?

32:14.516 --> 32:17.318
Sixty thousand per name. Dollars.

32:17.519 --> 32:21.071
- If it's good information.
- If it isn't good, it doesn't cost.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.741
Wael Zwaiter's here, in Rome.

32:24.192 --> 32:27.596
He just translated the
Arabian Nights into Italian.

32:27.696 --> 32:31.016
Tomorrow there's a reading. He's broke.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.602
He has a niece he calls
every day in Damascus.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.295
Are you trying to join the PLO?

32:36.580 --> 32:38.839
We need to talk. Alone.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.278
And also maybe you need
people to help with your work.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.655
Cars. Vans.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.570
If you tell anybody about this,
I don't know.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.156
Just don't.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.075
Just don't.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.720
Anything you need, we'll provide.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.973
I need receipts.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.135
Keep talking. Keep talking.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.628
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

38:25.345 --> 38:27.396
Are you Wael Zwaiter?

38:27.764 --> 38:29.856
Yes, and who are you?

38:34.104 --> 38:36.405
Do you know why we're here?

38:41.194 --> 38:43.805
- Are you Wael Zwaiter?
- He said yes already.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.872
He already said yes.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.085
What are we doing?

38:54.249 --> 38:56.008
What do I do?

38:56.292 --> 38:58.385
Do you know why we're here?

39:18.440 --> 39:20.008
What happened? Why didn't you shoot him?

39:20.108 --> 39:21.676
- We shot him.
- But I didn't hear a shot.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.595
We shot him eight times, maybe 10 times.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.347
- Did you kill him?
- He's dead.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.539
He shit his pants. He's dead.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.964
Drink some wine. We're celebrating.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.093
That old Pesach story.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.196
The angels are rejoicing...

40:23.296 --> 40:27.099
because the Egyptians have
just drowned in the Red Sea.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.412
I didn't say we're rejoicing.

40:30.512 --> 40:32.706
I said, "We're celebrating."

40:32.806 --> 40:35.375
And God said to the angels,
"Why are you celebrating?

40:35.475 --> 40:38.003
"I've just killed a multitude
of my children."

40:38.103 --> 40:39.903
Mr. Zwaiter.

40:40.355 --> 40:45.617
He cost us, by my calculations,
roughly $352,000.

40:47.737 --> 40:50.056
You didn't finish the story.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.434
The angels respond to God.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.269
They say, "God, we're celebrating...

40:54.369 --> 40:56.938
"because when the people hear
what happened to the Egyptians...

40:57.038 --> 40:58.565
"they'll understand your point."

40:58.665 --> 41:00.298
Which was?

41:00.959 --> 41:03.301
Don't fuck with the Jews.

41:04.212 --> 41:07.157
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm not celebrating.

41:07.257 --> 41:09.433
I'm goddamn rejoicing.

41:09.717 --> 41:12.370
Here. Put that down.
Put it down. Get up.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.080
- No, please.
- Come on, dance with me.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.499
- Dance with me. Come on.
- No.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.191
Come on.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.778
Come on. Hey.

41:54.429 --> 41:57.564
This is... What shall I call you today?

41:58.224 --> 42:00.025
Franz Storsch.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.653
You can call me Louis.

42:06.482 --> 42:09.701
- Our service has been satisfactory?
- Pricey.

42:12.113 --> 42:15.183
A Jew and a Frenchman.
We could haggle forever, huh?

42:15.283 --> 42:19.062
- I'm not a Jew.
- What do you suppose a ramson is?

42:19.162 --> 42:23.340
It's a kind of a wild leek.
Not in season, but garlic will do.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.694
My papa sometimes loses
track of the seasons.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.095
I know nothing about food.

42:29.464 --> 42:31.765
Why does he make me shop?

42:35.136 --> 42:37.705
You're wondering
if I'm French Intelligence.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.981
Or CIA or KGB.

42:40.099 --> 42:43.711
Or an agent with a profitable
sideline in information.

42:43.811 --> 42:47.113
I could be anybody.
You could be anybody, too.

42:47.232 --> 42:50.075
Identity. That's the boring part now.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.703
Here's what isn't boring.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.349
As long as you don't work
for any government...

42:56.449 --> 42:59.227
- I'm in private business.
- Rich Americans, I heard.

42:59.327 --> 43:02.295
I'm in private business, too. My family.

43:02.497 --> 43:07.193
We can locate almost anyone
for anyone anywhere...

43:07.293 --> 43:09.863
and we are ideologically promiscuous.

43:09.963 --> 43:12.198
We love everybody, hate everybody.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.683
I get my feelings confused.

43:14.842 --> 43:17.036
If you're not working
for any government...

43:17.136 --> 43:18.955
we know, or we find...

43:19.055 --> 43:21.606
we don't find, you don't pay.

43:22.350 --> 43:24.669
Initially it was the intention
of the hijackers...

43:24.769 --> 43:28.131
to bring the Lufthansa to
Munich International Airport...

43:28.231 --> 43:30.425
and then take onboard
the three prisoners...

43:30.525 --> 43:33.761
at the end of the runway,
where Captain Klausen took his plane...

43:33.861 --> 43:36.389
while an Arab held a
hand grenade at his head.

43:36.489 --> 43:37.849
Hey, Avner.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.685
A Lufthansa jet was hijacked
coming from Damascus.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.188
The hijackers demanded
the release of three killers...

43:43.288 --> 43:44.439
who survived Munich...

43:44.539 --> 43:46.774
and the Germans said yes, instantly.

43:46.874 --> 43:50.069
The Arabs would be flown by
private charter plane to Zagreb.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.387
Look. They're free now.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.222
They're in Libya.

44:01.597 --> 44:04.524
No qualms about rejoicing
on their side, eh?

44:04.976 --> 44:08.945
The Israeli kills the Arabs...

44:09.731 --> 44:12.550
in Egypt, in Jordan,
in Lebanon, in Syria...

44:12.650 --> 44:14.409
Look at them.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.329
They're movie stars.

44:17.739 --> 44:21.082
But did you shoot any
of the Israeli hostages?

44:21.534 --> 44:26.481
It's not important to say
if I killed Israelis or not.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.733
We should go to Tripoli.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.276
Kill them.

44:30.376 --> 44:32.344
We don't go to Arab countries.

44:32.712 --> 44:35.055
We stick to the names we've been given.

44:37.425 --> 44:39.351
Mahmoud Hamshari.

44:45.767 --> 44:47.794
Do you think, looking back on it now...

44:47.894 --> 44:50.505
that you achieved anything
in the Munich operation?

44:50.605 --> 44:55.802
We have made
our voice heard by the world.

44:55.902 --> 44:57.869
Are those your words?

45:01.240 --> 45:02.517
The same thing again.

45:02.617 --> 45:06.688
They have made their voice heard
by the universe or the world...

45:06.788 --> 45:09.089
who has not been hearing before.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.779
Well, I believe
what he meant by this is...

45:14.879 --> 45:17.931
that now the world
will begin hearing us.

45:19.175 --> 45:23.746
We are, for 24 years,
the world's largest refugee population.

45:23.846 --> 45:25.915
Our homes taken from us.

45:26.015 --> 45:29.752
Living in camps, no future, no food.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.487
Nothing decent for our children.

45:32.814 --> 45:36.199
And, so was the attack
in Munich justified?

45:37.235 --> 45:39.679
The PLO condemns attacks on civilians.

45:39.779 --> 45:42.724
- Though for 24 years...
- Tell your newspaper that.

45:42.824 --> 45:46.602
...our civilians have been attacked
by the Israelis day after day...

45:46.702 --> 45:49.689
Tell them about all the years
and years of Palestinian blood...

45:49.789 --> 45:52.066
spilled by Israel.
And who mourns for us?

45:52.166 --> 45:54.110
You know, Israel just bombed...

45:54.210 --> 45:56.696
two refugee camps in Syria and Lebanon.

45:56.796 --> 45:59.407
- Tell them that...
- 200 people killed.

45:59.507 --> 46:02.744
- Right after Munich they did this.
- It did not begin in Munich.

46:02.844 --> 46:05.913
And where does it end?
How will it ever end?

46:18.025 --> 46:21.179
I'm sorry, I need to use your phone.
I need to call my editor.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.163
Yes, yes. Sorry.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.642
- You see it. It's by the window.
- Thank you.

46:26.742 --> 46:28.710
This way, please.

48:30.283 --> 48:33.311
This man, we don't know
what he did specifically?

48:33.411 --> 48:36.647
Hamshari arranged the attempted
assassination of Ben-Gurion...

48:36.747 --> 48:38.441
in Copenhagen a few years ago.

48:38.541 --> 48:40.276
Now he organizes for Fatah in France.

48:40.376 --> 48:41.569
- He organizes?
- Yes.

48:41.669 --> 48:43.488
In Tel Aviv they showed
you evidence for this?

48:43.588 --> 48:45.072
Not evidence. It was more...

48:45.172 --> 48:46.949
this is the story and I believe them.

48:47.049 --> 48:48.576
Why? Don't you?

48:48.676 --> 48:51.537
It's a crisis, a war.
You don't have to always...

48:51.637 --> 48:54.749
- What? Be thinking?
- Scrutinize. Yeah, think.

48:54.849 --> 48:57.418
You want to wire Ephraim
and ask for evidence, you do it.

48:57.518 --> 48:59.527
You're on your own.

49:00.021 --> 49:01.756
- Okay, I'm done.
- Good.

49:01.856 --> 49:03.990
Don't think about it.

49:05.192 --> 49:06.594
Okay.

49:06.694 --> 49:10.663
So, now, I turn it on.

49:11.866 --> 49:15.293
He picks up the phone,
turns on the red light...

49:16.037 --> 49:19.339
then I take out the key, insert it...

49:19.624 --> 49:21.174
and turn.

50:24.480 --> 50:27.407
So now we wait for the red light.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.330
- Is the truck blocking the signal?
- No.

50:57.430 --> 50:59.814
Will the remote still work?

51:16.532 --> 51:18.976
- Yeah, it's a powerful transmitter.
- Go back to your position.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.687
You can't start improvising now.
Go back to your corner.

51:21.787 --> 51:24.422
Don't worry. It's okay.
It's going to work.

52:54.088 --> 52:55.930
- Stop!
- Stop!

52:57.216 --> 52:58.808
Abort.

53:44.638 --> 53:46.606
Are we on or off?

54:03.949 --> 54:06.083
- Mahmoud Hamshari?
- Yes.

54:20.674 --> 54:23.142
He's at the hospital Cochin.

54:23.510 --> 54:26.080
I don't know how badly we hurt him.
They aren't saying.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.915
Why did you put a firecracker
in that phone?

54:28.015 --> 54:29.834
Because I didn't want
to blow up the building.

54:29.934 --> 54:32.419
- What do you want from me?
- An Arab corpse.

54:32.519 --> 54:35.840
Another $200,000, more or less,
to eliminate target number two.

54:35.940 --> 54:38.425
Yeah, if he's been eliminated.
We should stick with guns.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.469
No one notices a shooting.

54:40.569 --> 54:42.096
Bombs achieve a double objective.

54:42.196 --> 54:44.765
They eliminate targets
and they terrify terrorists.

54:44.865 --> 54:47.268
That only works when the bombs work.

54:47.368 --> 54:48.876
Lunch?

54:56.293 --> 54:59.196
The Israeli embassy in London
was rocked by a letter bomb...

54:59.296 --> 55:01.365
shortly after 9:30 this morning.

55:01.465 --> 55:03.868
Dr. Ami Shachori was
opening his morning mail...

55:03.968 --> 55:07.121
when the envelope exploded,
killing him instantly.

55:07.221 --> 55:11.691
They discovered seven in a mailroom
near the embassy in Earls Court.

55:12.059 --> 55:14.986
- I guess they missed one.
- Right after Hanukkah.

55:15.437 --> 55:18.823
I guess there was a big pileup
of mail and they got careless.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.844
They found other letters
in Israel, of course.

55:21.944 --> 55:25.973
Canada, Argentina, Vienna,
Kinshasa, Paris, Brussels.

55:26.073 --> 55:29.583
Dozens of them,
mainly posted in the Netherlands.

55:29.910 --> 55:31.669
It's all Black September.

55:31.912 --> 55:34.046
It's a response, then.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.649
To Hamshari.

55:35.749 --> 55:37.591
And to Zwaiter.

55:38.335 --> 55:41.095
They're talking to us.
We're in dialogue now.

55:42.256 --> 55:44.015
Where are you?

55:45.092 --> 55:47.852
I'm in New York, following a lead.

55:48.012 --> 55:49.895
I'll call again.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.159
Are you going to visit your father?

56:04.778 --> 56:06.931
Why is this taking so long?

56:07.031 --> 56:08.831
It isn't fast.

56:09.283 --> 56:11.876
We have the best hospitals in the world.

56:12.828 --> 56:16.839
When you were born, your father
was elsewhere. I was alone.

56:17.750 --> 56:19.675
He was in prison.

56:21.962 --> 56:23.971
Should you be here?

56:24.089 --> 56:26.098
Aren't you on duty?

56:26.425 --> 56:29.268
What are you going to do? Turn me in?

56:30.763 --> 56:32.396
How is he?

56:32.973 --> 56:35.125
I don't visit your father so much.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.753
Wilma lets him yell at her all the time.

56:37.853 --> 56:39.820
She depresses me.

56:45.027 --> 56:46.744
How are you?

56:47.780 --> 56:50.831
I'm managing. Don't worry about me.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.546
I'm proud of what you are doing.

56:57.831 --> 57:00.341
You don't know what I'm doing.

57:10.177 --> 57:14.480
I look at you and I know
everything I need to know.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.193
She is frighteningly ugly.

57:19.686 --> 57:21.779
She takes after you.

57:22.523 --> 57:24.925
I want you to move, for a time.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.469
I've arranged a place
for us in Brooklyn.

57:27.569 --> 57:29.763
I can't come back to Israel.
I don't know how long for...

57:29.863 --> 57:30.973
New York?

57:31.073 --> 57:34.143
- I can see more of you this way.
- New York City?

57:36.745 --> 57:40.423
But I have my family here,
and your parents.

57:41.208 --> 57:44.028
You want my parents to help raise her?

57:44.128 --> 57:46.429
Look what they did to me.

57:47.339 --> 57:50.683
Don't you want your daughter
to be an Israeli, Avner?

57:51.885 --> 57:54.288
She'll always be an Israeli.

57:54.388 --> 57:57.291
Not in Brooklyn.
She'll just be another homeless Jew.

57:57.391 --> 57:59.793
I can't do what
I'm doing if I can't see you.

57:59.893 --> 58:01.902
What are you doing?

58:03.397 --> 58:06.532
Don't do it then, Avner.
This is our home.

58:06.817 --> 58:09.452
You're the only home I ever had.

58:10.028 --> 58:11.412
What?

58:12.823 --> 58:14.433
This is so corny.

58:14.533 --> 58:16.894
- It wasn't easy for me to say that.
- I bet.

58:16.994 --> 58:19.146
Don't laugh at me then.

58:19.246 --> 58:21.982
Why did I have to marry
a sentimentalist?

58:22.082 --> 58:24.258
You're ruining my life.

58:24.376 --> 58:26.677
Your mother's teasing me.

58:39.725 --> 58:42.401
Look at the waistline bulge on that guy.

58:42.561 --> 58:45.488
Look at that.
Think he might be armed, eh?

58:45.689 --> 58:47.740
As are the Russians.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.344
It's definitely him.

58:50.444 --> 58:52.578
Hussein Abad al-Chir.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.664
His room is next to Israeli newlyweds.

58:55.991 --> 58:58.310
They married in Cyprus
because she's not Jewish.

58:58.410 --> 58:59.812
A mixed marriage.

58:59.912 --> 59:01.355
A shande for the goyim.

59:01.455 --> 59:04.048
Yeah, okay.
But let's try not to blow them up.

59:04.291 --> 59:07.069
The KGB brings him home
every night after dark.

59:07.169 --> 59:09.613
He turns on the light, gets undressed...

59:09.713 --> 59:13.474
turns off the light,
gets into bed, we blow up the bed.

59:14.885 --> 59:18.372
I knew a field agent who got
too scared to sleep in his bed.

59:18.472 --> 59:22.024
So every night he slept
on the floor of his closet.

59:22.643 --> 59:24.735
He still does, every night.

59:25.229 --> 59:26.672
Sleeps in closets.

59:26.772 --> 59:29.800
Now if al-Chir sleeps in his closet,
we're in trouble.

59:29.900 --> 59:33.744
But if he gets in the bed,
his weight arms the device...

59:34.029 --> 59:36.247
it closes the circuit.

59:36.823 --> 59:39.542
Then we hit the remote.

59:46.708 --> 59:48.175
Okay.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.594
Okay, we're good. We're good, let's go.

59:55.384 --> 59:56.785
Careful.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:03.649
I've checked into the room next door.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.611
- Why?
- There are balconies.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.506
When he gets into bed...

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.825
I give the signal by
switching off the light.

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:16.453
And if the bomb's too powerful
and you're in the next room?

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.891
Well, that won't happen.

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:20.499
Right?

01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:22.167
Robert?

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.461
- Robert?
- Robert?

01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:27.172
It won't. No.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.258
Okay.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.136
Avner.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.806
Boy or girl?

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:38.392
A girl.

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.936
Mazel tov.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.400
News from Paris.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:51.030
Dr. Hamshari succumbed to his wounds.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:55.618
So, again, mazel tov, Avner.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.257
Steve, shut up.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:12.903
Hey.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.675
Good evening.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.070
Good evening.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.655
Beautiful night.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.973
Beautiful night, yeah.

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.245
- Where are you from? I can't place...
- Düsseldorf.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:48.021
Yes? I wouldn't have guessed it.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.525
I thought perhaps a Swede.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.655
I taught in Sweden,
Near Eastern languages.

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:58.365
Really?

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.636
Teaching Lebanese immigrant
women how to clean houses.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:03.430
In Swedish.

01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:13.422
Were you here last night?

01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:16.884
No. Just checked in. Just arrived.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:20.095
Don't plan to sleep.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.723
They keep at it all night.

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:24.975
There, for hours.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.120
- Take a sleeping pill.
- That's okay.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.747
- I can sleep through anything.
- Are you sure?

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:29.998
You don't want to borrow one of mine?

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.750
- Thank you very much. It's okay.
- Really?

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:32.918
Yes.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.152
So, good night.

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.571
Pleasant dreams.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:27.454
Wait for the signal.

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:30.040
Wait for Avner's light to go out.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.643
Go! Go! Go!

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:52.664
- Oh, my God!
- Help!

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:56.937
Oh, my eyes. My eyes, I can't see.

01:05:57.037 --> 01:05:58.897
Can someone help me?

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:00.815
I can't see.

01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:02.215
Avner!

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.513
Please! Oh, my God!

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.516
I can't see.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.621
- Can you see?
- Yes.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.039
- The stairs are that way.
- Okay.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.690
- Go that way.
- Come on. Let's go!

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:22.754
- It was much too powerful.
- Stop it.

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.631
- You could've blown up innocent...
- Target number three.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:25.882
Target number three was not in doubt.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.301
The ceiling in the lobby cracked.
You nearly demolished...

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.928
Avner might have been killed.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.513
The plastique was not what I asked for.

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.306
It couldn't have been
the grade I specified.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.433
Someone changed the
marking on the explosive.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.435
What if someone changed the marking?

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:39.521
- What do you mean?
- Louis provided the plastique.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:42.107
Avner, Louis provided the explosives?

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:45.008
- Yes. Why?
- Why are we trusting him?

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:47.779
We have no idea who he is.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.656
- He's finding our targets.
- Yes, but...

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.950
But without him,
we'd be nowhere on this!

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:55.727
The plastique was much more
powerful than what I asked for.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:58.999
Someone changed the label.
I could have killed you.

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:01.376
For all we know,
Louis works for the PLO.

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.962
They're using us to do
internal housecleaning.

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.046
That's bullshit.

01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:07.781
Hey, whose fishing boat is this?

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.288
Louis arranged it.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:49.883
There was nothing wrong
with the explosive.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:53.053
Bomb makers are nervous,
which is understandable.

01:07:53.153 --> 01:07:54.387
Fear makes them sloppy...

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:56.163
There's nothing wrong
with my bomb maker.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.457
It's your explosives.

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.960
We found three more names for you.

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:04.921
- Three?
- Yes, three.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.468
- Thought you'd be pleased.
- I am.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:11.970
Who?

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:16.558
Kemal Adwan, Kamal Nasser,
and Abu Youssef.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:19.435
Adwan and Abu Youssef.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.897
- Where?
- Lebanon.

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.084
They're in Beirut.

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:26.693
Adwan, Nasser, Youssef.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.089
Serious characters, huh?

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.156
Extremely serious.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:35.160
Smile, Mr. Storsch.
It's a second Christmas.

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.515
I'd like to pay you
a little extra for this.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.582
These three names.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:45.002
$600,000.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.984
Monsieur Storsch, my group...

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.653
we don't care much for governments...

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:53.196
any governments.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:55.115
We don't work with or for them.

01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:57.617
That's an absolute condition
of my theory.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.285
You understand?

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.330
If I learn that your sudden
generosity was an attempt...

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:05.792
to buy our acquiescence in
your sharing my information...

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:09.587
with, let us say,
CIA or MI6 or Mossad...

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:12.674
- I don't work for MI6 or CIA...
- You have no idea who you work for.

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:14.282
Trust me. You don't.

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:18.912
Lie to me and you will find me
abruptly unreachable...

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:20.997
and unhappy.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:25.060
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No. You save your money.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:27.796
At these prices,
you're going to need it.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.817
It's obviously significant information.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:35.154
Abu Youssef is like number three
in the whole Palestinian network.

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:36.865
It's like Arafat, Habash, and then him.

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:38.908
Of course he's significant.
Thanks for the instruction...

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.827
- and enthusiasm.
- He's the brains of the fedayeen.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.162
- I know who he is.
- Next to Salameh...

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.457
Abu Youssef is the worst
guy we're after, right?

01:09:45.557 --> 01:09:48.859
And Adwan, he plans all the
actions in the West Bank, right?

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:51.837
We get the significance.
These are serious targets.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.506
- We want to go to Beirut.
- No.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.091
You keep away from the Arab countries.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.510
Mossad and the army
will take care of it.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.554
What is this contraption?

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:02.789
You can't send the army.
We won't allow it.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.560
You won't allow it?

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.729
Our source doesn't know we're Mossad.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:09.189
You aren't Mossad.

01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:11.983
If commandos go to Beirut,
our source will cut us off.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:15.069
Why don't you and I go for a
walk and talk about this, alone?

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:16.529
The food will get cold.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.656
- We have to go to Beirut.
- We're good at this.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.533
This is our information,
this is our job.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.994
That's touching in a
juvenile sort of way.

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.621
Listen. You're doing reasonably well.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:26.414
- Reasonably?
- You're spending a lot of money.

01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:28.273
Well, we expected that.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:33.379
Lots of people in Mossad
don't know about you.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.006
No one knows.

01:10:35.106 --> 01:10:37.675
So everyone's asking,
"Who's killing the fedayeen?

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:39.761
"Is it our guys? Why weren't we told?"

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:42.329
Big egos. Lots of screaming.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.017
I can maybe include one or two of you...

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:48.561
but excluding Mossad
or the army is impossible.

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:50.063
Accept it.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:52.672
We will, but our source won't.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:55.508
Who is your source?

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:57.695
It's time you told me.

01:10:57.795 --> 01:10:59.781
That, by the way,
is not a request. It's an order.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:01.866
You can't order him.
He doesn't work for you.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.536
Shut up. I pay you. You work for me.

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:07.831
I work for a metal box in a bank in Geneva.
The box pays me.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:10.834
- You want to find it empty?
- I want you to let us do our work!

01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.919
What's the matter with you?

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:15.755
With all of you?
Grow up and do it quick.

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:18.424
This is not a game, a fucking game.

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:21.219
Who has the source?
Where are you getting your information?

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:23.703
Give me his goddamn number!

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.266
I hope the old lady
next door enjoyed that.

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:29.876
She's a little deaf but I doubt
she had any trouble hearing you.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.465
Give me the source
and we'll let you take part.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.402
Let us go to Beirut.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:41.805
After Beirut, we'll use our source
to find the remaining targets.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.890
Let us do our job.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.228
A lot of manpower to shoot three guys.

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:00.467
- Ehud Barak.
- Daniel.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.380
Go!

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.210
Where the fuck is he?

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:21.131
Door!

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:30.473
- Let's go!
- Go!

01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:32.475
Go! Go!

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:35.687
Go!

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:46.948
It's him!

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.602
Don't shoot! No!

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:35.205
Fedayeen!

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:43.189
Go!

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:51.382
- My papa would like to meet you.
- Papa?

01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:54.635
My papa. He runs our little group.

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.888
I thought you ran the group.

01:16:56.988 --> 01:16:59.414
Everybody works for someone.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.792
I wasn't in Beirut.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.896
Well, someone was there.

01:17:04.996 --> 01:17:08.441
The Israeli army, according to
every newspaper on Earth.

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:10.234
But you stayed away...

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:13.696
after you paid so extravagantly
for the information.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.365
I don't like to keep my papa waiting.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.618
I need to tell my people
where I'm going.

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:20.536
You don't know where you're going.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:23.855
And you'll need to wear this.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:26.626
Forget it, Louis. That's just crazy.

01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:28.651
We're done here.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:36.242
Shit.

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.077
Wait!

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:40.538
Wait!

01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:27.687
We're here.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:49.774
Papa!

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.374
He's over there.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:21.741
Louis says you're a cook.

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:24.142
I know how to cook, yeah.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:25.977
You help me?

01:19:31.142 --> 01:19:33.109
Bring these there.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:42.511
No, no. Don't wash. No, no.
They will taste like boiled sponge.

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.555
But then why put them in the sink?

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.099
If the juices spurt out,
it's a big mess.

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:50.168
The whole kitchen will smell like piss.

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.671
Peel off the fat.

01:19:56.876 --> 01:19:59.051
Let me see your hands.

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.783
Too big for a good cook.

01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:06.327
That was my problem, too.
I had been a master...

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:09.789
but I have thick, stupid,
butcher's hands just like yours.

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:14.150
Well, we are tragic men.
Butcher's hands, gentle souls.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.975
These are going to be too sour to eat.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:33.711
Skin them and prick them,
boil them in sugar.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:37.715
A little torture,
and you'll see how nice they are.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:41.529
- You call me "Papa."
- I can't do that.

01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:44.055
- No?
- I have a papa already.

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:48.100
You are devoted to him?

01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:50.704
Am I here because of
what happened in Beirut?

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.606
Your papa must be proud of his son.

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:58.027
We'll pick a few. Let the rest ripen.

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:00.297
There are so many people to feed, but...

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:02.299
But they are your family.
So you have to feed them.

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:05.743
Yes. We don't work with governments.

01:21:05.903 --> 01:21:07.513
Louis said. But...

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:11.874
But you did what you did because
you have to feed your family.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.538
I blew up trains, bridges...

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:35.773
and trucks full of Germans
during the war.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:42.113
My brothers were killed,
my papa and my sister were both hanged.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.091
She was a young girl.

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:47.952
Papa, the guest doesn't want
to hear your war stories.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:52.057
We paid this price,
so Vichy scum could be replaced...

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.976
by Gaullist scum...

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:57.920
and the Nazis could be
replaced by Stalin and America.

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:00.506
We stay away from governments.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.384
We say grace?

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:06.137
Maybe our guest could lead us.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.476
No, no, no. It's not required.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:24.089
Our Father, who gives us obedient
and respectful clients...

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.991
who obey the rules according to
which our business thrives...

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:32.121
whose prevarications and deceptions...

01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:45.843
In my despair I fathered madmen...

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:50.616
who dress like factory workers,
but never do manual labor...

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:53.744
and who read nonsense
and spout pompous bullshit...

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:57.206
about Algerians and who love nothing...

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.791
not Algerians or French...

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.859
or flesh and blood, or anything living.

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:06.465
So I have sympathy for a man
who can say, "I have a papa"...

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:08.133
and who does
what he must for his family.

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:17.041
I will say grace.

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:27.820
There's some opinion you
should be punished...

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.322
for what happened in Beirut.

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.366
We didn't know so many would die.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:36.227
I'm in business with death.
Do you think I'm squeamish?

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:42.066
The world has been rough
with you, with your tribe.

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:47.446
It's right to respond
roughly to such treatment.

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:53.285
You pay well and you pay promptly,
so we'll continue together.

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:58.207
- But no more infractions.
- Thank you. You have my word.

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:17.101
A few andouillettes and boudins noirs...

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:22.523
black blood sausage and a
Loire cheese, Selles-sur-Cher.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:26.444
- We cover it in ash to preserve it.
- Thank you.

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:30.072
You could have been my son.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:35.870
But you're not. Remember that.

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:41.333
We'll do business,
but you aren't family.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:32.134
I have a new name for you.

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:35.387
I want Ali Hassan Salameh.

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:39.266
No.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.371
You know where he is.
You know where all the names are.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:45.439
- Salameh.
- Untouchable.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.026
Salameh.

01:25:56.777 --> 01:25:58.577
Zaid Muchassi.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:05.042
Zaid Muchassi is in Athens in two weeks.

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:07.980
- Not one of our names.
- Nevertheless.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.733
He is Black September's KGB contact.

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:13.193
Hussein al-Chir was the KGB contact.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:16.655
Yes. But you put a bomb under
Monsieur al-Chir's bed in Cyprus...

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:20.266
and now he's defunct.
Muchassi is his replacement.

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:23.727
I hear he's much tougher
than his predecessor.

01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:33.005
We offer Muchassi's
whereabouts at the new rate.

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:36.550
- What new rate?
- Three names for $600,000...

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.493
is $200,000 for one name.

01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:47.144
I need you to find me a
place to work in Athens.

01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:50.421
Of course. Safe house.

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.571
Is this Louis's idea of a joke?

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:19.074
I've had nightmares
that looked like this.

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:23.555
So when they explode, they toss
little white balls of phosphorus...

01:27:23.655 --> 01:27:26.934
here all around his room.
Each ball, it's like a little sun.

01:27:27.034 --> 01:27:28.977
It burns at around 5,000 degrees.

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:32.254
So the air catches fire.

01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:34.733
Everything in the vicinity melts.

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:36.735
Now, the bad news is
they are grenades...

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:40.239
so I modified them to use
with a remote detonator.

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:42.282
I also should mention
that they're quite old...

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:43.682
like World War II.

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:47.228
Only four were viable.
We should dump the rest.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:50.707
There's a porter at the hotel
where Muchassi's staying.

01:27:50.807 --> 01:27:52.918
He's gonna let us in the
room when Muchassi goes out.

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:56.088
Hey. Who provided these
prehistoric explosives?

01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:59.573
- Louis.
- Yeah. I'll thank him for that.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.130
Tallyho.

01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:38.881
Stop! Stop!

01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:42.634
- PLO! PLO!
- ETA! ETA!

01:28:42.734 --> 01:28:44.845
Put the gun down or we'll shoot.

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:48.080
Basque! Basque!

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:52.918
Okay.

01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:03.595
Put the gun down! Put it down!

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:12.354
Put it down.

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:40.215
- Which French? Louis?
- Who are you? English?

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:45.012
Basque. ETA. Red Army Faction.

01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:49.058
He's ANC. African. African.

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:53.479
We are from Amman. I'm Ali.

01:29:54.306 --> 01:29:58.442
Said. George. Abed.

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:02.488
We paid for two nights.

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:05.657
He said it was safe.

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:10.579
- He told us the same.
- Yes. Safe house.

01:30:12.199 --> 01:30:13.874
Yes.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:18.379
So we're safe?

01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:21.548
Safe.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.885
Everyone is safe.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:35.789
Eventually the Arab states
will rise against Israel.

01:31:36.158 --> 01:31:40.085
They don't like Palestinians,
but they hate the Jews more.

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:42.647
It won't be like 1967.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:46.568
The rest of the world will see by
then what the Israelis do to us.

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:50.804
They won't help when Egypt
and Syria attack. Even Jordan.

01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:53.599
Israel will cease to exist.

01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:58.395
What?

01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:03.567
This is a dream. You can't take back
a country you never had.

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:05.462
- You sound like a Jew.
- Fuck you.

01:32:05.562 --> 01:32:08.590
I'm the voice inside your head
telling you what you already know.

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:11.241
You people have nothing to bargain with.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:13.095
You'll never get the land back.

01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:16.848
You'll all die old men in refugee
camps waiting for Palestine.

01:32:16.948 --> 01:32:19.476
We have a lot of children.
They'll have children.

01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:21.019
So we can wait forever.

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:24.689
And if we need to, we can make
the whole planet unsafe for Jews.

01:32:24.789 --> 01:32:26.900
You kill Jews and the world
feels bad for them...

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.361
- and thinks you are animals.
- Yes.

01:32:29.461 --> 01:32:32.531
But then the world will see how
they've made us into animals.

01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:36.934
They'll start to ask questions
about the conditions in our cages.

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:41.730
You are Arabs.
There are lots of places for Arabs.

01:32:43.141 --> 01:32:45.442
You're a Jew sympathizer.

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:49.446
All you Germans,
you're too soft on Israel.

01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:53.218
Well, you give us money,
but you feel guilty about Hitler.

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:55.953
And the Jews exploit that guilt.

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:58.997
My father didn't gas any Jews.

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:05.796
- Tell me something, Ali.
- What?

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:10.300
Do you really miss your
father's olive trees?

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:15.264
Do you honestly think you have
to get back all that... that nothing?

01:33:15.548 --> 01:33:17.284
That chalky soil and stone huts.

01:33:17.384 --> 01:33:20.245
Is that what you really
want for your children?

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:22.396
It absolutely is.

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:28.026
It will take a hundred years,
but we'll win.

01:33:28.979 --> 01:33:32.739
How long did it take the Jews
to get their own country?

01:33:33.066 --> 01:33:36.011
How long did it take the Germans
to make Germany?

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:37.929
And look how well that worked out.

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:41.141
You don't know what it
is not to have a home.

01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:44.334
That's why you European Reds
don't get it.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:48.755
You say, "It's nothing,"
but you have a home to come back to.

01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:52.152
ETA, ANC, IRA...

01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:55.363
we all pretend we care about
your international revolution...

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:57.431
but we don't care.

01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:00.183
We want to be nations.

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:03.395
Home is everything.

01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:46.897
- No, no, no.
- No, I watch.

01:34:47.724 --> 01:34:50.043
You only take money
enclosed in papers, yes?

01:34:50.143 --> 01:34:51.777
Of course.

01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:46.123
Look there.

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:50.127
Here they come in their pumpkin coach.

01:35:53.623 --> 01:35:55.924
The Russians and...

01:35:58.795 --> 01:36:00.637
Cinderella.

01:36:19.732 --> 01:36:23.869
Do we detonate if the other
Arabs go into the room with him?

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.171
Why are the Russians waiting?

01:36:34.831 --> 01:36:39.092
- Why don't they leave?
- They are waiting.

01:36:41.504 --> 01:36:45.599
- We are waiting. Stay calm.
- Hey, I'm calm.

01:36:57.103 --> 01:37:00.030
- He's in his room. Do it.
- Is he alone?

01:37:00.148 --> 01:37:04.201
- How do we know if he's alone?
- Just flip the switch. Do it.

01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:12.519
- I don't understand it.
- What's wrong?

01:37:12.619 --> 01:37:14.711
It's a piece of shit.

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:18.590
- What? Fuck! Not again.
- Wait, wait.

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:22.487
Where's the explosion?
It should've exploded by now.

01:37:22.587 --> 01:37:24.697
- What's gone wrong?
- It's another malfunction.

01:37:24.797 --> 01:37:25.824
You know what?

01:37:25.924 --> 01:37:27.742
- Or maybe it's delayed...
- He has fucked up again!

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:30.161
- Or maybe it could still blow up.
- This is a waste of time!

01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:32.771
Careful with that stuff, Hans.

01:37:38.478 --> 01:37:40.004
- Hans!
- Hans, what are you doing?

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:42.155
Hans, get back here!

01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:48.388
Hey, hey! What is he doing?

01:37:48.488 --> 01:37:50.413
Hans. No, no.

01:38:18.226 --> 01:38:20.777
So how long is he going to be?

01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:23.214
Maybe one hour.

01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:25.759
I know you.

01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:29.721
Stop!

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:52.118
Get in! Head down!

01:40:24.435 --> 01:40:28.571
Ali? Ali? Ali?

01:40:34.779 --> 01:40:37.682
Are you incapable of making
something that works?

01:40:37.782 --> 01:40:39.851
Shut up! You shut up!

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:41.519
Does anybody speak Greek?

01:40:41.619 --> 01:40:43.896
- Shut him up!
- Did we kill a Russian?

01:40:43.996 --> 01:40:45.898
- That's not good!
- Where did you get your training?

01:40:45.998 --> 01:40:48.985
Every single bomb,
every fucking one, is fucked up.

01:40:49.085 --> 01:40:50.945
I was not trained to do this!

01:40:51.045 --> 01:40:54.639
I was trained to dismantle bombs,
not to build them!

01:40:57.093 --> 01:40:58.768
Holy shit.

01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:04.083
Shin Bet wanted bomb dismantlers.
They picked me from the army.

01:41:04.183 --> 01:41:05.668
- A toy maker.
- Give me some money.

01:41:05.768 --> 01:41:08.611
They figured I was good
with small machines.

01:41:09.188 --> 01:41:13.950
But then after Munich, they asked
if I could build bombs instead.

01:41:14.819 --> 01:41:16.619
So I said yes.

01:41:22.702 --> 01:41:26.171
Come on. Here.

01:41:34.964 --> 01:41:37.283
The three went to the side
of the customs hall...

01:41:37.383 --> 01:41:40.411
took out pieces of their rifles,
and quickly assembled them.

01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:43.665
Then they threw hand grenades into
the long queues of passengers...

01:41:43.765 --> 01:41:47.752
waiting to clear passport control
and began automatic fire.

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:50.046
It was all over in a matter of minutes.

01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:51.923
And the firing was indiscriminate.

01:41:52.023 --> 01:41:53.740
Salameh is in London.

01:41:56.486 --> 01:42:00.330
He goes there periodically to
meet with his CIA contact.

01:42:00.865 --> 01:42:04.626
- His what?
- Salameh works for the CIA.

01:42:05.411 --> 01:42:06.771
Bullshit.

01:42:06.871 --> 01:42:09.273
Salameh guarantees
that Black September...

01:42:09.373 --> 01:42:11.109
won't touch American diplomats.

01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:14.153
In exchange,
the CIA gives him lots of money.

01:42:14.253 --> 01:42:16.721
And they don't ask what he uses it for.

01:42:18.424 --> 01:42:20.660
Did he tell them
about Munich in advance?

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.370
Did the CIA know about Munich?

01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:24.914
The CIA didn't even know
Black September existed...

01:42:25.014 --> 01:42:26.856
before Munich.

01:42:27.892 --> 01:42:30.002
One of the guerrillas was
shot through the head...

01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:31.295
by a ricochet bullet.

01:42:31.395 --> 01:42:33.881
A second was blown up
by his own hand grenade.

01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:36.366
Since then, he's been busy.

01:42:36.943 --> 01:42:38.576
Hasn't he?

01:42:39.612 --> 01:42:42.205
All manner of costly exercises.

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:44.642
Shooting tourists
in the Athens airport...

01:42:44.742 --> 01:42:47.103
blowing up pharmacies in Amsterdam...

01:42:47.203 --> 01:42:50.547
and that Mossad agent
in Barcelona before that.

01:42:50.915 --> 01:42:55.718
Europe hasn't been this interesting
since Napoleon marched to Moscow.

01:42:56.337 --> 01:42:58.763
Do you have to do that here?

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:03.226
Salameh is in London.
For the usual price.

01:43:12.103 --> 01:43:14.589
We followed him from
his doctor to his hotel.

01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:16.966
- He's here for eye treatment.
- Salameh. You saw him?

01:43:17.066 --> 01:43:18.342
- You followed him?
- Yes.

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:20.595
- Wearing sunglasses in the rain.
- Why didn't you shoot him?

01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:22.096
There were bodyguards. Civilians.

01:43:22.196 --> 01:43:23.347
- Were they armed?
- Yes.

01:43:23.447 --> 01:43:25.850
Well then, they're not civilians.
I'd have done it...

01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:27.810
if you'd give me half a chance
to actually shoot someone.

01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:30.271
I'm the only one who actually
wants to shoot these guys.

01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:32.064
Maybe that's why we never let you do it.

01:43:32.164 --> 01:43:34.358
- We only go after our targets.
- Since when?

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:36.152
I mean, why are
we worried about that now?

01:43:36.252 --> 01:43:39.530
Do you have any idea how
many laws we've broken?

01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:42.909
It's time to stop your agonizing.
It's counterproductive.

01:43:43.009 --> 01:43:46.412
Including, incidentally,
the laws of the state of Israel...

01:43:46.512 --> 01:43:47.789
which has no death penalty.

01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:50.500
You know what your problem is, habibi?

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.043
You're disorientated.

01:43:52.143 --> 01:43:54.545
Because the guys we're killing
are dressed in expensive suits...

01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:57.006
and this is London
and not some ugly Arab village.

01:43:57.106 --> 01:43:58.758
I'm not disoriented.

01:43:58.858 --> 01:44:01.302
I'm keeping my sanity by
occasionally reminding myself...

01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:02.470
that in spite of...

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:04.305
But it's the same
old war we're fighting...

01:44:04.405 --> 01:44:05.640
I'm still, at least in principle,
a human being.

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.016
...over the same old scrap of desert!

01:44:07.116 --> 01:44:09.477
It's just we've brought our war
to Copenhagen and Kensington...

01:44:09.577 --> 01:44:12.063
and it's not like these European
anti-Semites don't deserve that.

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:15.399
Unless we learn to act like them,
we will never defeat them.

01:44:15.499 --> 01:44:17.735
We act like them all the time.

01:44:17.835 --> 01:44:20.071
What, you think the Palestinians
invented bloodshed?

01:44:20.171 --> 01:44:22.573
How do you think we got control
of the land? By being nice?

01:44:22.673 --> 01:44:25.076
Somebody pull down this man's pants.
See if he's circumcised.

01:44:25.176 --> 01:44:26.661
I think we have
a double agent in our midst.

01:44:26.761 --> 01:44:29.413
- Don't you dare accuse me of that!
- Stop it!

01:44:29.513 --> 01:44:32.375
My son died in '67,
you foul-mouthed son of a bitch.

01:44:32.475 --> 01:44:34.669
Everything you can ask,
I've done for Israel.

01:44:34.769 --> 01:44:37.797
Ask for a reassignment
if this is so distasteful.

01:44:37.897 --> 01:44:40.740
- Why, it's not distasteful to you?
- No.

01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:44.827
'Cause the only blood that
matters to me is Jewish blood.

01:44:47.073 --> 01:44:50.250
Nice job. Nice job leading.

01:44:52.036 --> 01:44:54.188
If the bodyguards are armed,
we kill them.

01:44:54.288 --> 01:44:57.340
- They're armed.
- Well, then we kill them!

01:45:43.671 --> 01:45:44.822
Taxi!

01:45:44.922 --> 01:45:46.222
Taxi!

01:46:29.675 --> 01:46:32.370
Roger Burke, you ugly fuck!
What are you doing in London?

01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:34.455
Get your hands off me.

01:46:34.555 --> 01:46:36.707
Put them up.
Put them up, you fat, wet puss!

01:46:36.807 --> 01:46:38.542
Let's show these limey fucks
what we're made of.

01:46:38.642 --> 01:46:41.295
Hey, wait a minute! Who the fuck...
Who do you think this is then?

01:46:41.395 --> 01:46:42.672
- Roger Burke.
- Who do you think this is?

01:46:42.772 --> 01:46:45.591
- No, you idiot. That is not...
- Lay off him, asshole.

01:46:45.691 --> 01:46:48.659
- That's not him. Come on.
- It's Roger Burke.

01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:50.221
I'm sorry about my friend, you know?

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:53.599
He's a fucked-up, belligerent guy
with a serious drinking problem.

01:46:53.699 --> 01:46:57.144
- Hey, come here.
- Lose it.

01:46:57.244 --> 01:46:59.522
- Come on. Calm down!
- Hey, calm down.

01:46:59.622 --> 01:47:02.465
Hey, come here! Calm down!

01:47:04.794 --> 01:47:08.280
Back off. Get back!

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.658
- Back off! Back off!
- Fuck off!

01:47:10.758 --> 01:47:12.201
It's me. All right!

01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:14.811
- All right. Come on.
- Fuck off!

01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:17.289
- It's me, Roger, Orrin!
- Come on.

01:47:17.389 --> 01:47:22.026
- It's me. Remember me? Sorry.
- It's all right.

01:47:22.853 --> 01:47:25.363
You should have ducked, Roger!

01:47:31.946 --> 01:47:33.514
Fucking Americans!

01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:35.349
- What the fuck is that?
- Was it Salameh?

01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:37.917
Yes, of course it was fucking Salameh!

01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:02.275
I take it she'd eat you up a bit, huh?

01:48:03.352 --> 01:48:05.129
You old dog.

01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:07.280
He's got some ideas.

01:48:08.357 --> 01:48:11.159
- Oh, the American bloke?
- Aren't we all?

01:48:11.277 --> 01:48:13.971
So you've heard these rumors?
These are wild stories.

01:48:14.071 --> 01:48:16.015
- Wild stories.
- Yeah?

01:48:16.115 --> 01:48:17.415
Yeah.

01:48:42.141 --> 01:48:43.608
Can I?

01:48:51.442 --> 01:48:56.078
I have to go to bed soon.
I work in the morning.

01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.207
What kind of work do you do?

01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:04.295
The kind that drives you to drink.

01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:06.797
We must have the same job, then.

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:10.510
I love your accent.

01:49:11.212 --> 01:49:13.095
I love your perfume.

01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:25.775
Cuts right through the smoke.

01:49:27.478 --> 01:49:28.986
Does it?

01:49:29.855 --> 01:49:31.948
It's very nice.

01:49:36.487 --> 01:49:39.956
Look, I don't want to be forward...

01:49:40.366 --> 01:49:42.291
but it's late...

01:49:42.451 --> 01:49:46.045
and I do have to get up early.

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:47.880
So...

01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:51.968
- So?
- So...

01:49:53.295 --> 01:49:55.805
So, you're very nice, and...

01:49:59.009 --> 01:50:01.811
Are you really going to make me ask?

01:50:08.394 --> 01:50:09.986
I just can't.

01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:12.321
Pity.

01:50:12.856 --> 01:50:15.825
- You're very attractive.
- I know.

01:50:18.696 --> 01:50:20.264
If you come to your senses...

01:50:20.364 --> 01:50:23.100
once you get up to your lonely room...

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.501
well, maybe I'll be here.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.798
Or maybe I'll be in my room,
alone in bed.

01:50:37.381 --> 01:50:39.056
Good night.

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:01.912
The drunk Americans.
You think they were CIA?

01:51:02.406 --> 01:51:05.768
They could've been.
For all we know, Louis is CIA.

01:51:05.868 --> 01:51:08.479
They work both sides. Everyone does.

01:51:08.579 --> 01:51:11.523
Or Louis is Mossad.
Now, maybe he isn't...

01:51:11.623 --> 01:51:13.275
but they're using him
to feed us information.

01:51:13.375 --> 01:51:14.944
There's no direct link.

01:51:15.044 --> 01:51:17.863
Or Mossad's giving it to CIA,
which is giving it to Louis...

01:51:17.963 --> 01:51:19.782
and Ephraim's demanding
we give him Louis...

01:51:19.882 --> 01:51:22.326
because he knows we expect him to do...

01:51:22.426 --> 01:51:25.645
Stop chasing the mice inside your skull.

01:51:30.434 --> 01:51:33.694
You know, I never thought you'd last.

01:51:34.605 --> 01:51:36.548
I thought the same about you.

01:51:36.648 --> 01:51:39.343
From the beginning
you seemed so reluctant.

01:51:39.443 --> 01:51:41.303
I was born reluctant. Ask my mother.

01:51:41.403 --> 01:51:43.013
If I can't kvetch, I can't do my job.

01:51:43.113 --> 01:51:45.349
You ever feel reluctant?

01:51:45.449 --> 01:51:48.000
I'm not comfortable with confusion.

01:51:48.994 --> 01:51:51.689
I knew guys like you in the army.

01:51:51.789 --> 01:51:54.316
You'll do any terrifying
thing you're asked to do...

01:51:54.416 --> 01:51:56.926
but you have to do it running.

01:51:57.753 --> 01:52:02.264
You think you can outrun
your fears, your doubts.

01:52:03.842 --> 01:52:08.979
The only thing that really
scares you guys is stillness.

01:52:10.641 --> 01:52:13.859
But everyone's overtaken, eventually.

01:52:15.312 --> 01:52:17.881
Now, the mice need a brandy.
Will you join me?

01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:20.551
No, I'm going to go upstairs,
straight to bed.

01:52:20.651 --> 01:52:21.885
You okay drinking by yourself?

01:52:21.985 --> 01:52:24.954
It's just a shot to numb the brain.
Good night.

01:52:28.409 --> 01:52:29.709
Oh.

01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:33.129
- Beware of the local honey trap.
- Indeed?

01:52:33.747 --> 01:52:36.799
You can't miss her. You don't want to.

01:52:57.187 --> 01:52:58.380
Hello.

01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:00.632
This is a trunk call from Mr. Storsch.

01:53:00.732 --> 01:53:01.967
Do you accept the charges?

01:53:02.067 --> 01:53:05.220
Shit, Avner, you woke up the baby,
but that's okay... I mean...

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.996
How are you?

01:53:07.865 --> 01:53:09.290
I miss you.

01:53:09.825 --> 01:53:12.936
You're in England or Australia...

01:53:13.036 --> 01:53:15.713
- or the North Pole...
- Yeah, that's right.

01:53:17.499 --> 01:53:19.610
So listen, I was thinking...

01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:22.529
when I'm finished doing
what I'm doing here...

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.281
I want to come to Brooklyn to see you.

01:53:24.381 --> 01:53:27.117
Brooklyn is depressing.
It's got more churches than Jerusalem.

01:53:27.217 --> 01:53:28.369
Listen to her talk.

01:53:31.054 --> 01:53:34.440
- Can you hear me? Can she hear me?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:38.611
Hey. Talk to me.

01:53:40.939 --> 01:53:43.699
Daphna, make her talk.

01:53:53.911 --> 01:53:55.211
Dada.

01:53:59.833 --> 01:54:03.219
Hey. Hey, sweetheart. It's your papa.

01:54:05.088 --> 01:54:07.389
This is my voice, darling.

01:54:09.426 --> 01:54:12.728
This is what I sound like.
Don't forget, okay?

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.501
Listen, I have to get her to bed.
She's tired.

01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:19.819
She'll dream about you.

01:54:52.052 --> 01:54:56.188
We're standing at a distance,
as instructed by the terrorists.

01:54:57.099 --> 01:54:59.585
Are we going? Is it to the airport?

01:54:59.685 --> 01:55:00.919
Can we talk to someone, just to say...

01:55:01.019 --> 01:55:02.963
Shut up, okay?
Just get on the bus, okay?

01:55:03.063 --> 01:55:06.675
Just to tell our families.
Just to say we are all right!

01:55:06.775 --> 01:55:09.511
Everybody, just relax, okay?
Relax! Calm down.

01:55:09.611 --> 01:55:13.682
We will ride this bus and fly away.
After, you go back to your home...

01:55:13.782 --> 01:55:16.083
or to your Olympic Games.

01:57:13.819 --> 01:57:16.954
Carl. You asshole.

01:57:17.447 --> 01:57:19.415
I saw her first.

01:57:37.467 --> 01:57:38.934
Carl?

01:59:16.107 --> 01:59:19.785
She's Dutch, not political,
entirely business-minded.

01:59:20.028 --> 01:59:22.871
She lives in Hoorn. She's there now.

01:59:23.156 --> 01:59:25.142
This is dependable information.

01:59:25.242 --> 01:59:27.477
For which you pay nothing.

01:59:27.577 --> 01:59:30.188
We're giving you this.
You understand why?

01:59:30.288 --> 01:59:32.524
Because you want me to believe
that you had nothing to do...

01:59:32.624 --> 01:59:34.484
with the murder of my partner.

01:59:34.584 --> 01:59:38.363
We inhabit a world of
intersecting secrecies.

01:59:38.463 --> 01:59:41.992
We live and die at the places
where those secrecies meet.

01:59:42.092 --> 01:59:44.268
That's what we accept.

01:59:44.845 --> 01:59:48.063
We buy information for you
from your enemies.

01:59:49.266 --> 01:59:50.375
This alerts them.

01:59:50.475 --> 01:59:53.068
You're not the only people
looking for names.

01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:55.756
You're telling me I'm being hunted now?

01:59:55.856 --> 01:59:58.717
He's telling you it's time
for you to quit.

01:59:58.817 --> 02:00:02.637
The race is not to the swift,
nor the battle to the strong...

02:00:02.737 --> 02:00:05.747
but time and chance happens to them all.

02:00:18.128 --> 02:00:20.179
Evil falls suddenly.

02:00:22.173 --> 02:00:24.516
Who can say when it falls?

02:00:47.616 --> 02:00:50.250
So you're really gonna kill her?

02:00:51.286 --> 02:00:55.631
- All this blood comes back to us.
- Eventually it will work.

02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:58.800
Even if it takes years, we'll beat them.

02:00:59.502 --> 02:01:01.470
We're Jews, Avner.

02:01:01.755 --> 02:01:03.824
Jews don't do wrong because
our enemies do wrong.

02:01:03.924 --> 02:01:06.409
We can't afford to be
that decent anymore.

02:01:06.509 --> 02:01:08.954
I don't know that we ever
were that decent.

02:01:09.054 --> 02:01:13.124
Suffering thousands of years of
hatred doesn't make you decent.

02:01:13.224 --> 02:01:16.920
But we're supposed to be righteous.
That's a beautiful thing.

02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:18.338
That's Jewish.

02:01:18.438 --> 02:01:20.906
That's what I knew,
that's what I was taught.

02:01:21.816 --> 02:01:24.594
And now I'm losing it,
and I lose that, that's...

02:01:24.694 --> 02:01:27.120
- That's...
- That's everything.

02:01:27.489 --> 02:01:29.331
That's my soul.

02:01:31.993 --> 02:01:35.462
You need to go rest somewhere.
You don't have to do this one.

02:01:37.374 --> 02:01:39.549
When I need you again, I'll find you.

02:02:32.721 --> 02:02:35.188
Excuse me. Who are you?

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:44.990
Do you know why we're here?

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:47.200
I want to get dressed, okay?

02:02:53.366 --> 02:02:56.877
Maybe you want to hire me.
You know how good I am.

02:03:01.875 --> 02:03:03.300
No. Don't.

02:03:03.835 --> 02:03:06.678
It's such a fucking waste of talent.

02:03:17.974 --> 02:03:19.793
Where're you going? Stay here.

02:03:19.893 --> 02:03:21.651
Shell. Shell.

02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:23.653
Yeah.

02:03:59.307 --> 02:04:00.857
Leave it.

02:04:18.868 --> 02:04:22.337
In seven months we've
killed six of the 11 names.

02:04:22.831 --> 02:04:25.275
We've killed one replacement.

02:04:25.375 --> 02:04:27.444
One of our targets
is in prison and four...

02:04:27.544 --> 02:04:30.679
including Ali Hassan Salameh,
are at large.

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:33.640
One of our own has fallen.

02:04:34.134 --> 02:04:37.120
Since we began, the other side has
sent letter bombs to 11 embassies...

02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:39.521
hijacked three planes...

02:04:39.722 --> 02:04:43.650
killed 130 passengers in Athens
and wounded scores more...

02:04:43.977 --> 02:04:46.629
and killed our military
attaché in Washington.

02:04:46.729 --> 02:04:50.133
Some of it was done by a Venezuelan
called Carlos the Jackal...

02:04:50.233 --> 02:04:52.135
who replaced Zaid Muchassi...

02:04:52.235 --> 02:04:54.703
who replaced Hussein al-Chir.

02:04:55.572 --> 02:04:59.416
Black September's original
leadership has been decimated.

02:05:01.202 --> 02:05:03.646
But new leaders are emerging...

02:05:03.746 --> 02:05:06.673
for whom Black September
wasn't violent enough.

02:05:09.377 --> 02:05:11.946
And to dispatch our six
dispatched targets...

02:05:12.046 --> 02:05:15.325
we must have spent something
close to $2 million, right?

02:05:15.425 --> 02:05:19.060
You've been cooking.
Are you expecting company?

02:05:19.637 --> 02:05:22.272
Mrs. Meir says to the Knesset...

02:05:23.766 --> 02:05:26.503
the world must see that killing Jews...

02:05:26.603 --> 02:05:29.863
will be from now on an
expensive proposition.

02:05:31.774 --> 02:05:34.409
But killing Palestinians
isn't exactly cheap.

02:05:37.739 --> 02:05:41.625
- If all 11 were dead, you'd stop?
- Yes.

02:05:42.619 --> 02:05:47.005
You're lying.
What about their replacements?

02:05:47.457 --> 02:05:50.592
With each time we kill,
we create six more.

02:05:51.211 --> 02:05:52.987
Maybe they'll have to
keep killing them, then.

02:05:53.087 --> 02:05:54.596
Forever.

02:05:55.506 --> 02:05:57.575
Five targets are still alive.

02:05:57.675 --> 02:05:59.661
That's five men that need to be killed.

02:05:59.761 --> 02:06:02.288
Eventually you forget that in
the beginning you hated doing it.

02:06:02.388 --> 02:06:03.957
For me personally,
I feel less every day.

02:06:04.057 --> 02:06:06.042
One day I'm going to wake up,
I'm going to kill...

02:06:06.142 --> 02:06:09.444
I'm going to go back to bed,
I'm not going to feel anything at all.

02:06:11.231 --> 02:06:15.552
Hey, Hans? You know there's a rule
in the book against blind drunks.

02:06:15.652 --> 02:06:17.554
Why don't you stop drinking
and eat something?

02:06:17.654 --> 02:06:21.248
I mean, there's enough food
here to feed Bangladesh.

02:06:23.952 --> 02:06:27.921
I keep seeing that Dutch woman,
you know, sprawled out like that.

02:06:31.084 --> 02:06:34.195
It's not that I wish
we hadn't killed her.

02:06:34.295 --> 02:06:37.389
I wish I had let you
close up her housecoat.

02:06:37.674 --> 02:06:41.518
Yeah, but you weren't yourself.

02:06:56.150 --> 02:06:57.617
Avner.

02:07:00.196 --> 02:07:01.496
Avner.

02:07:03.783 --> 02:07:05.083
Avner.

02:07:05.368 --> 02:07:08.670
I went to Hans' flat above
the antique shop...

02:07:08.913 --> 02:07:12.173
just to check up on him
because he was so...

02:07:12.875 --> 02:07:15.695
Anyway, he's gone somewhere,
and I waited all night...

02:07:15.795 --> 02:07:17.721
and he's not come back.

02:07:38.568 --> 02:07:40.035
Knife.

02:07:44.824 --> 02:07:47.167
They didn't take anything.

02:12:09.005 --> 02:12:10.346
What?

02:12:40.995 --> 02:12:43.087
It will be beautiful.

02:12:44.248 --> 02:12:48.009
Ali Hassan Salameh is
in Tarifa on the Spanish coast.

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:52.698
He's at a compound guarded
by all the predictable trouble.

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:55.850
Bomb makers often die accidental deaths.

02:12:57.928 --> 02:13:00.521
In Athens you shot a KGB agent.

02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:05.944
Many people must want to kill you,
Monsieur Storsch.

02:13:06.062 --> 02:13:09.656
But why would I do that?
You pay better than anyone.

02:13:14.904 --> 02:13:17.705
It's dangerous going after Salameh.

02:13:18.699 --> 02:13:20.875
But he planned the Munich massacre.

02:13:24.705 --> 02:13:28.716
Eliminate him, and they'll let you
go home. Don't you think?

02:13:31.921 --> 02:13:33.888
Yes, Louis. I do.

02:13:37.593 --> 02:13:40.728
You could have a kitchen
like that someday.

02:13:43.557 --> 02:13:47.652
It costs dearly, but home always does.

02:14:44.034 --> 02:14:46.836
Shit! It's like a funhouse in there.

02:14:47.329 --> 02:14:49.505
Can you tell how many?

02:15:09.018 --> 02:15:10.693
That's him.

02:15:14.899 --> 02:15:17.408
Are you sure it's him, Avner?

02:15:18.778 --> 02:15:20.828
You have to be sure.

02:16:22.758 --> 02:16:24.410
- I'm Avner Kaufman.
- We know.

02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:27.204
- You want to ride with us?
- Hop in.

02:16:27.304 --> 02:16:28.896
Please.

02:16:34.436 --> 02:16:37.780
I'm Amos. This is Avi. Shin Bet.

02:16:38.398 --> 02:16:40.324
We're not supposed
to know who you are...

02:16:41.192 --> 02:16:42.386
because we're not officers.

02:16:42.486 --> 02:16:45.538
We're just shit
and no one tells us shit.

02:16:47.031 --> 02:16:49.959
We've heard about what you've done.

02:16:51.662 --> 02:16:54.213
We want to say it's an honor
to meet you.

02:16:59.128 --> 02:17:01.512
It's an honor for me, too.

02:17:10.638 --> 02:17:12.958
I have no problems with
anything you guys did...

02:17:13.058 --> 02:17:16.193
except the woman
on the houseboat in Hoorn.

02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:18.214
Steve's told us about her.

02:17:18.314 --> 02:17:19.507
We took a leave of absence...

02:17:19.607 --> 02:17:20.883
and killed her off the company clock.

02:17:20.983 --> 02:17:22.050
Don't be an idiot.

02:17:22.151 --> 02:17:25.494
Otherwise, as I said, we have no
problems with the job you did.

02:17:26.155 --> 02:17:28.224
Except three of my men died.

02:17:28.324 --> 02:17:29.391
According to your colleague...

02:17:29.491 --> 02:17:31.602
I should say, emphatically,
according to your colleague...

02:17:31.701 --> 02:17:33.228
not in any way your fault.

02:17:33.329 --> 02:17:34.480
He sings your praises.

02:17:34.580 --> 02:17:37.465
Best guy he ever worked for, and so on.

02:17:41.045 --> 02:17:44.406
He says this French group...
Louis was his name?

02:17:44.505 --> 02:17:47.493
They sold the terrorists information
regarding your whereabouts.

02:17:47.593 --> 02:17:49.602
They helped kill your men.

02:17:50.596 --> 02:17:52.832
I know Steve believes that,
but it's not true.

02:17:52.932 --> 02:17:54.522
Tell us who they are.

02:17:56.852 --> 02:17:59.153
They won't work with you.

02:18:00.272 --> 02:18:03.424
- It's about loyalty.
- You're an Israeli officer.

02:18:03.525 --> 02:18:06.410
That's your only loyalty! That's it!

02:18:09.156 --> 02:18:10.539
Okay.

02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:14.727
This is General Hofi of
the Northern Command.

02:18:14.827 --> 02:18:16.629
You look good.

02:18:17.039 --> 02:18:20.609
Listen, the Prime Minister is
proud of you and your men.

02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:22.736
She wishes she could tell you herself,
but she can't.

02:18:22.835 --> 02:18:25.054
She never heard of you, right?

02:18:25.547 --> 02:18:28.993
Good. She says you've done
a great thing for your people.

02:18:29.093 --> 02:18:30.768
For Israel.

02:18:34.889 --> 02:18:38.025
That's it.
There is no medal or anything.

02:18:49.405 --> 02:18:52.748
June 16, 1973. Avner Kaufman interview.

02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:56.502
Go ahead.

02:19:00.582 --> 02:19:02.883
Tell me what you learned.

02:19:05.546 --> 02:19:07.573
- What I learned?
- Yes.

02:19:07.673 --> 02:19:09.724
What did you learn?

02:19:12.052 --> 02:19:13.537
For God's sake!

02:19:13.637 --> 02:19:16.314
Tell me the names and
numbers of your sources.

02:19:20.394 --> 02:19:21.837
Avner, tell me.

02:19:21.937 --> 02:19:25.239
Tell me the names and
numbers of your sources.

02:19:26.358 --> 02:19:27.867
Please.

02:19:28.818 --> 02:19:32.038
I can have you court-martialed,
and I might.

02:19:32.448 --> 02:19:35.915
You can't. I don't work for you.

02:19:37.536 --> 02:19:39.337
I don't exist.

02:19:41.373 --> 02:19:44.592
- You look terrible.
- I'm not good right now.

02:19:46.837 --> 02:19:50.973
You don't need to tell me anything.
It's taken a lot from you.

02:19:51.383 --> 02:19:55.728
- I'm alive, right?
- And the rest sorts itself out.

02:19:56.930 --> 02:20:00.649
I'm not a fool, Avner.
I never said you were a fool.

02:20:10.444 --> 02:20:14.538
Everyone in Europe died.
Most of my family.

02:20:15.199 --> 02:20:16.684
A huge family.

02:20:20.329 --> 02:20:22.773
I never talked to you about it.

02:20:22.873 --> 02:20:26.133
- I knew.
- You knew? So what was there to say?

02:20:27.294 --> 02:20:29.905
I didn't die, because I came here.

02:20:30.005 --> 02:20:33.409
When I arrived, I walked up to
the top of a hill in Jerusalem...

02:20:33.509 --> 02:20:36.620
and prayed for a child.

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:39.707
I never prayed before,
but I was praying then.

02:20:39.807 --> 02:20:43.359
And I could feel every one
of them praying with me.

02:20:46.605 --> 02:20:48.989
You are what we prayed for.

02:20:49.858 --> 02:20:52.326
What you did, you did for us.

02:20:52.486 --> 02:20:55.597
You did for your daughter,
but also for us.

02:20:55.697 --> 02:20:59.208
Every one of the ones who died,
died wanting this.

02:21:00.536 --> 02:21:04.231
We had to take it,
because no one will ever give it to us.

02:21:04.331 --> 02:21:07.842
A place to be a Jew among Jews,
subject to no one.

02:21:09.711 --> 02:21:12.430
I thank God for hearing my prayer.

02:21:14.299 --> 02:21:16.642
Do you want to know, Mama?

02:21:17.886 --> 02:21:20.729
Do you want me to tell you what I did?

02:21:22.432 --> 02:21:23.774
No.

02:21:24.935 --> 02:21:28.696
Whatever it took, whatever it takes.

02:21:30.274 --> 02:21:35.536
A place on Earth.
We have a place on Earth.

02:21:36.697 --> 02:21:38.247
At last.

02:21:47.833 --> 02:21:50.217
- What's this?
- Baklava.

02:21:50.794 --> 02:21:53.989
From Rehovot? The only edible
baklava is from the Arabs in Jaffa.

02:21:54.089 --> 02:21:56.283
Eat it on the plane. You're too thin.

02:21:56.383 --> 02:21:58.726
I hope it gives you a bellyache.

02:21:59.845 --> 02:22:01.163
Listen, forget it.

02:22:01.263 --> 02:22:03.957
You go see your wife, your child,
rest for a few more months.

02:22:04.057 --> 02:22:05.751
Then we're gonna
put you back in the field.

02:22:05.851 --> 02:22:07.586
Not Europe. Probably Latin America.

02:22:07.686 --> 02:22:11.197
You think it over. Rest, Avner.
Then you come back.

02:22:13.150 --> 02:22:14.492
No.

02:22:41.136 --> 02:22:42.204
That's all right.

02:22:42.304 --> 02:22:45.749
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

02:22:45.849 --> 02:22:49.318
Look at that beautiful hair.

02:23:36.024 --> 02:23:37.658
Nightmares?

02:23:38.527 --> 02:23:39.868
Yes.

02:23:43.031 --> 02:23:44.915
Come back to bed.

02:23:47.202 --> 02:23:49.837
I have no idea where I should be.

02:23:55.919 --> 02:24:00.681
The place is nice.
You've made it really nice.

02:24:01.717 --> 02:24:03.851
The kitchen's too big.

02:25:21.546 --> 02:25:24.473
Sylvie, I need to speak to your father.

02:25:26.301 --> 02:25:28.102
Is Louis there?

02:25:29.471 --> 02:25:32.207
I need to speak to your father.
Have him call me.

02:25:32.307 --> 02:25:36.402
212-664-7665.

02:25:36.812 --> 02:25:39.571
I'll wait. He must call me. I'll wait.

02:25:43.485 --> 02:25:45.327
Am I being hunted?

02:25:45.695 --> 02:25:47.306
Is my family being hunted?

02:25:47.406 --> 02:25:52.394
How is your father? He's well?
Your family is well?

02:25:52.494 --> 02:25:56.064
I don't know. How is my family?
Are they well?

02:25:56.164 --> 02:25:57.482
Are they going to be okay?

02:25:57.582 --> 02:26:00.319
I'm sending you a parcel
of sausage and cheese.

02:26:00.419 --> 02:26:03.572
Real cheese.
The kind you can't find in America.

02:26:03.672 --> 02:26:07.474
It isn't pasteurized,
so it won't taste like shit.

02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:11.812
It's a real pleasure to
hear your voice again.

02:26:12.639 --> 02:26:15.190
I think about you with concern.

02:26:15.350 --> 02:26:17.276
Do you believe me?

02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:20.320
Avner?

02:26:20.856 --> 02:26:23.031
You believe me, Avner?

02:26:24.943 --> 02:26:26.595
You know my name?

02:26:26.695 --> 02:26:28.495
Of course I do.

02:26:29.865 --> 02:26:32.124
Now, listen to me. It's important.

02:26:33.201 --> 02:26:36.378
No harm will come to you from me.

02:27:01.062 --> 02:27:04.907
You can't go in there, sir.
It's a restricted area. Sir?

02:27:05.317 --> 02:27:07.427
I tried to stop him.
I don't know who this guy is.

02:27:07.527 --> 02:27:10.370
Security!

02:27:11.406 --> 02:27:13.016
If you're Mossad, you know who I am.

02:27:13.116 --> 02:27:15.977
If you don't,
tell Ephraim Avner came to see him.

02:27:16.077 --> 02:27:17.479
Being in this room
is by appointment only.

02:27:17.579 --> 02:27:19.064
Shut up and listen to me.

02:27:19.164 --> 02:27:21.650
I won't hesitate to kill
other people's children...

02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:23.777
- if you hurt my child. Understand?
- Do I know you, sir?

02:27:23.877 --> 02:27:26.947
Or wives if you hurt my wife,
or fathers if you hurt my father.

02:27:27.047 --> 02:27:29.241
I don't care. I'll go to the newspapers.

02:27:29.341 --> 02:27:32.202
I'll give every name of everybody
who was in the meetings.

02:27:32.302 --> 02:27:36.313
I'll tell them everything if you
don't leave my family alone! Okay?

02:32:05.033 --> 02:32:06.708
I love you.

02:32:31.267 --> 02:32:32.734
Avner.

02:32:38.024 --> 02:32:39.825
Phone for you.

02:32:40.068 --> 02:32:41.827
He's Israeli.

02:32:46.449 --> 02:32:49.084
You think we'd hurt your family?

02:32:49.244 --> 02:32:52.129
I think anyone is capable of anything.

02:32:52.247 --> 02:32:54.881
I think you're losing your mind.

02:32:59.546 --> 02:33:01.596
Did I commit murder?

02:33:04.509 --> 02:33:06.578
I want you to give me proof
that everyone we killed...

02:33:06.678 --> 02:33:07.704
had a hand in Munich.

02:33:07.804 --> 02:33:10.123
I don't discuss such things
with people who don't exist.

02:33:10.223 --> 02:33:12.709
You want to discuss,
come back to existence.

02:33:12.809 --> 02:33:14.836
You want your daughter
to grow up in exile?

02:33:14.936 --> 02:33:16.820
I want evidence.

02:33:20.233 --> 02:33:23.845
Professor Hamshari with
the beautiful wife and child?

02:33:23.945 --> 02:33:27.182
He was implicated in a failed
assassination attempt on Ben-Gurion.

02:33:27.282 --> 02:33:29.601
He was recruiting for Fatah France.

02:33:29.701 --> 02:33:30.977
You stopped him.

02:33:31.077 --> 02:33:32.562
We should have tried
to bring him to Israel.

02:33:32.662 --> 02:33:34.689
And Zwaiter,
your harmless little writer in Rome?

02:33:34.789 --> 02:33:38.067
He was behind the bomb on
El Al flight 76 in 1968.

02:33:38.167 --> 02:33:39.944
He was working on
another bomb last August.

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:41.112
I could go on and on with this.

02:33:41.212 --> 02:33:43.740
According to evidence nobody has seen.

02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:46.659
If these people committed crimes,
we should have arrested them.

02:33:46.759 --> 02:33:48.560
Like Eichmann.

02:33:48.761 --> 02:33:50.580
If these guys live, Israelis die.

02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:54.941
Whatever doubts you have,
Avner, you know this is true.

02:34:04.277 --> 02:34:06.513
You did well, but you're unhappy.

02:34:06.613 --> 02:34:09.289
- I killed seven men.
- Not Salameh.

02:34:09.824 --> 02:34:11.583
We'll get him, of course.

02:34:14.537 --> 02:34:16.796
You think you were the only team?

02:34:17.165 --> 02:34:20.151
It's a big operation.
You were only a part.

02:34:20.251 --> 02:34:22.344
Does that assuage your guilt?

02:34:23.296 --> 02:34:25.472
Did we accomplish anything at all?

02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:28.326
Every man we killed has
been replaced by worse.

02:34:28.426 --> 02:34:31.412
Why cut my fingernails?
They'll grow back.

02:34:31.512 --> 02:34:33.915
Did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership...

02:34:34.015 --> 02:34:35.375
or the Palestinian leadership?

02:34:35.475 --> 02:34:37.126
You tell me what we've done.

02:34:37.226 --> 02:34:38.920
You killed them for the
sake of a country...

02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:40.570
you now choose to abandon.

02:34:41.773 --> 02:34:45.635
The country your mother and father built,
that you were born into.

02:34:45.735 --> 02:34:48.745
You killed them for Munich,
for the future, for peace.

02:34:50.281 --> 02:34:53.393
There's no peace at the end of this,
no matter what you believe.

02:34:53.493 --> 02:34:56.771
- You know this is true.
- Here's what I know.

02:34:56.871 --> 02:34:58.857
Your father is sick,
your mother will be alone.

02:34:58.957 --> 02:35:02.467
You're a sabra.
Your wife and daughter are sabras.

02:35:03.086 --> 02:35:05.595
What I came to say is this...

02:35:06.506 --> 02:35:08.139
come home.

02:35:22.146 --> 02:35:24.406
Come to my house for dinner tonight.

02:35:25.942 --> 02:35:27.969
Come on.
You're a Jew, you're a stranger.

02:35:28.069 --> 02:35:30.638
It's written someplace or
other that I'm meant to...

02:35:30.738 --> 02:35:33.748
ask you to come and break bread with me.

02:35:34.033 --> 02:35:38.878
So break bread with me, Ephraim.

02:35:42.583 --> 02:35:43.925
No.
