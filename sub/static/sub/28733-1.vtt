01:24.084 --> 01:30.045
Alice: I've had the same dream
three nights in a row.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.084
Michael: What is it?

01:33.969 --> 01:34.628
It's night.

01:34.636 --> 01:38.470
I'm swimming on my back
at the bottom of this cave.

01:38.473 --> 01:43.809
The water's warm, and I'm
staring up at all these stars.

01:43.812 --> 01:47.145
And then they just blink out.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.561
And, suddenly,
the water gets very cold,

01:49.568 --> 01:53.060
and I realize
there's this ceiling,

01:53.113 --> 01:54.728
like, right on top of me.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.731
And there's a door
in the middle,

01:56.742 --> 02:01.031
and I reach for it, but
the water is like cement now,

02:01.038 --> 02:05.748
and it keeps pulling me down,
and I just can't get to it.

02:05.751 --> 02:10.871
And I start panicking,
and I can't breathe.

02:10.881 --> 02:13.793
I start gasping for air.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.712
Then I wake up.

02:17.012 --> 02:20.345
What do you think
that's all about?

02:20.349 --> 02:23.056
I don't know.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.142
Come here.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.812
I know this is hard for you.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.688
I know it is.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.112
This is hard for me, too.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.906
That's it. We're going away.
We're going to Europe.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.656
I'm taking you to Italy.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.750
What about... Barcelona?

02:49.753 --> 02:51.539
Barcelona? No. They have the...

02:51.546 --> 02:53.958
- Oh, the lisp. Is that it?
- The lisp.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.796
You've got a thing
with this lisp.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.086
I don't. No, they have a thing.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.880
They lisp when they say
"Barcelona."

02:58.887 --> 03:00.252
The lisp is muy

03:00.263 --> 03:02.595
- okay.
- No, we're going to Italy,

03:02.599 --> 03:05.466
a week apiece in Rome and venice

03:05.477 --> 03:08.969
and a third week
on the amalfi coast.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.561
That's three weeks, huh?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.726
That's three weeks.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.144
Alice: Mm.

03:14.194 --> 03:18.437
I think I'm gonna need
a really big suitcase.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.154
Okay.

03:20.158 --> 03:24.447
We'll get you
a really big suitcase.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.203
What do you think?

03:27.416 --> 03:31.034
I think I've heard this before.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.368
Hey.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.247
We're going, okay?

03:36.258 --> 03:38.590
Come here.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.464
I got to get going.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.134
I got to shower.

[I door opens I

03:52.232 --> 03:53.768

04:07.205 --> 04:09.787
Hi, Mei ling.
This is Alice from 508.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.077
You said that someone
was gonna be by the other day

04:12.085 --> 04:13.871
to fix my bathtub,
and they never showed,

04:13.879 --> 04:17.120
so if you could please
send someone a.S.A.P, ,

04:17.132 --> 04:18.212
that would really be amazing.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.459
Oh, and I would prefer that they
don't enter unless I'm here.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.632
Thank you.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.932
Laurel: I kept calling,
but he never answered

04:32.939 --> 04:35.555
'cause nobody likes to talk
on the phone anymore.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.023
I did see a guy last week,
though,

04:37.027 --> 04:38.688
but he had something
stuck in his teeth

04:38.695 --> 04:40.231
when he picked me up
from the bus stop.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.693
And, oh, my god,
his place was so barren.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.941
Like my dad's
growing up in waco.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.317
You know... where the cult was.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.615
Anyway, my sponsor
says that I'm isolating

04:49.623 --> 04:50.954
and that I need to date,
and I want to,

04:50.957 --> 04:53.949
but I am just so afraid of being
monkey-fucked again, you know?

04:53.960 --> 04:54.949
- It's just...
- Okay.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.622
- Thank you.
- Laurel: I'm not even horny.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.245
It's just,
I can't stop touching myself.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.380
It's become
some sort of an ocd thing.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.839
Leader: Thank you, Laurel.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.926
We need to move on
to the next share.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.922
Who wants to go next?

05:08.099 --> 05:08.633
Go ahead.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.758
Hi. I'm Alice, love addict.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.385
Together: Hi, Alice.

05:13.814 --> 05:18.103
So, I'm still seeing
the married man.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.523
I'm just really in love
with him.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.070
And I know he loves me.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.737
But I also know he'll probably
never leave his wife.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.737
And my sponsor's always
telling me that I deserve more,

05:31.748 --> 05:32.863
that I deserve to be put first

05:32.874 --> 05:34.410
and not just this thing
on the side

05:34.417 --> 05:39.127
just feeding off crumbs,
and... and she's right.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.496
I need to grow up.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.796
And saying this stuff out loud
in front of you guys

05:44.803 --> 05:47.590
really helps give me
the strength to leave,

05:47.597 --> 05:50.213
so thank you for listening.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.466
Leader: Thank you. Okay.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.308
Who would like to go next?

05:54.312 --> 05:58.021
"Li can't stop touching myself.
It's an ocd thing."

05:58.024 --> 05:59.309
Who talks like that?

05:59.317 --> 06:01.603
Ugh, she's gonna scare away
all the newcomers

06:01.611 --> 06:04.227
and make them think
we're a bunch of pervs.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.524
She's probably fucking homeless.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.488
- Oh, let me have a drag.
- Do you want one?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.107
No, no, no. I quit. Just a drag.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.485
Mm.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.454
Okay, so, no contact.

06:14.457 --> 06:18.746
Alice, you have
to do it this time.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.039
I know.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.747
You know, when Michael and I
used to make love,

06:23.758 --> 06:25.669
I used to feel so amazing.

06:25.677 --> 06:29.670
Now it just feels like
I'm some stripper whore.

06:29.681 --> 06:33.139
"Stripper, whore,"
or like a whore that strips?

06:33.143 --> 06:34.929
- I don't know. Both.
- Miranda: Ugh.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.723
Speaking of strippers,
if I don't lose this baby fat,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.221
my husband's gonna leave me
for one.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.938
Alice: Oh, come on.
You look great.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.478
I'll have to get a job,

06:42.485 --> 06:45.352
go back to Wells Fargo.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.110
No, thank you.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.026
You know, you can always
come to pilates with me.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.025
Fuck that. I'll just get lipo.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.321
Okay.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.240
That's an option.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.365
Alice, you are
such a beautiful person.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.992
You deserve to be happy.
Come on.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.040
No guy gets to ruin your life.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.664
Unless he's a billionaire.
Then screw it.

- Okay, no contact.
- No contact.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.223
Yeah, I think I've seen you
in the building.

09:24.230 --> 09:29.145

the other day.

- Thank you so much.
- Mm-hmm.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.131
All right. You know, actually,

outside in the garbage chute.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.892

- Thank you.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.106
Appreciate it.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.226
You know, Shelly?

10:12.237 --> 10:16.901
Do you do any housecleaning,
by any chance?

10:16.908 --> 10:19.115
- Owner won't allow it.
- Right. Mei ling.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.484

She's an interesting one.

Um, well, if you're open to it,
I can pay you cash.

that come in and out every day,

and this place
just gets really dirty.

10:49.274 --> 10:52.232

10:53.027 --> 10:56.611

if ever there was!

12:08.102 --> 12:10.969
Herb and I went to an owl cafe.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.095
We ate raw fish.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.471
We drank gallons of "saa-ke."

12:13.483 --> 12:18.147
And then we walked along
these cherry-tree-lined streets.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.270
That sounds very romantic.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.317

made me crave pie,
like, all day.

right after this.

Did I just get that in your eye?

- Uh, yeah, you did.
- Oh, okay.

- It's okay. I got you.

you're all prepared.

'cause in first class,

17:19.664 --> 17:21.619
I can just have them
switch out the seats,

17:21.624 --> 17:24.330
and we can have someone
sit between us...

17:24.335 --> 17:27.667

gonna hide that from her?

as far as she's concerned.

It doesn't even matter 'cause
I already booked the tickets.

You got weak. That's normal.

over and turn off your phone.

- Um, it really looks lovely.
- Hm.

So, um, I know
that this is super-last-minute,

so I don't want you to feel
any obligation at all,

like to stay for dinner.

And now the best part
of any meal... turkish coffee.

up late, but it's so worth it.

or more in the Meadow lake area?

24:47.403 --> 24:49.689
Why?

25:24.106 --> 25:28.099

that I wouldn't wish
on an enemy.

So...

Yeah. But I am ending it.

No.

So, where will you stay?

27:23.934 --> 27:27.017
Just on the bottom floor.

In the garage?

Yeah.

You know, thanks for staying
for dinner tonight, Shelly.

It really helped me
get my mind off of things.

And it's always nice
to make a new friend.

really.

I don't know how.

How about on Friday

- It's been over a week, Ali.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.828
I-I cannot handle you
ignoring me. I...

32:45.839 --> 32:48.751
What kind of program tells you
to just cut people off?

32:48.758 --> 32:51.875
It's because I stay in

to her. I stay for Tyler.

Yeah, you're just
repeating yourself.

Because you don't hear me.

to get to where I am,

33:28.798 --> 33:29.833
and I'm gonna lose half.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.957
Alice: So it's all about money?

33:31.968 --> 33:33.208

This is about my son.
This is about Tyler.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.341

Do you have any idea what that
could do to him? 'Cause I do.

My father was a philandering
prick. He left us.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.896
You have no idea how much pain
that put me through.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.325

are you really that shallow?

34:06.336 --> 34:09.328

35:41.640 --> 35:43.631
Okay.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.974
There we go.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.393
That's good.

35:57.405 --> 36:01.819
Now you can be perfect.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.112
Pretty far from.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.494
I lid closes I

36:09.250 --> 36:12.834
the place looks great.

36:12.837 --> 36:13.542
As usual.

36:13.546 --> 36:19.132
Oh, the makeup. Did you want me
to show you how to put some on?

36:19.511 --> 36:21.718
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:21.721 --> 36:22.335
Come on.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.838
Well, this helps a lot
because most women

36:24.849 --> 36:26.589
actually have skin problems.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.138
So if you just mix
the yellow and green

36:29.145 --> 36:30.976
with the color
of your foundation,

36:30.980 --> 36:34.268
and it just tones down the red.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.608
You should have seen me
with this stuff in high school.

36:37.612 --> 36:41.070
Do you remember bozo the clown?

36:41.074 --> 36:42.154
Yeah.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.565
Well, that's pretty much
what I looked like

36:43.576 --> 36:49.367
before my mother finally showed
me how to use it properly.

36:49.749 --> 36:53.583
Do you have any makeup
of your own?

36:53.795 --> 36:55.285
No.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.160
Well, I'll tell you what.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.163
I have tons of it,
so before you leave,

36:58.174 --> 37:01.917
why don't I give you this brush
and this palette

37:01.928 --> 37:03.668
and some lip moisturizer?

37:03.680 --> 37:07.264
I'll make you up
a whole nice bag.

37:10.103 --> 37:12.185
I like your earrings.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.179
Oh, thank you.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.473
They were my grandmother's.

37:16.484 --> 37:19.976
She was my favorite.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.153
There. Have a look.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.484
Looks nice.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.362
And, you know, with a nice
dress... do you have a dress?

37:30.373 --> 37:32.329
Do you ever wear
anything like that?

37:32.333 --> 37:34.949
- Mnh-mnh.
- You know, I got this new one.

37:34.961 --> 37:39.330
Let me just check really quick.
I think I still have it.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.377
Let me just get this
tucked in right here.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.252
Okay. There you go.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.892
You look lovely.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.647
I look like you.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.769
You look very nice.

40:04.986 --> 40:08.899
Man:
Let me give you my impression.

40:09.115 --> 40:12.573
Doesn't it feel wonderful?

40:13.411 --> 40:16.619
- What in the world?
- Man:

40:16.623 --> 40:19.365
That's the latest fashion.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.911
I-I just can't...

40:20.919 --> 40:22.784
Man: I don't blame you.

40:22.795 --> 40:26.162
Let me give you my impression.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.542
Colleen: Damn it. Shit!

40:30.553 --> 40:32.134
Shit!

40:37.310 --> 40:40.302
Okay. That's enough.

40:40.313 --> 40:41.553
But I'm still hungry.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.680
I know, sweetie, but you
can't have too much salt.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.728
It gives you that puffy look.

40:46.736 --> 40:49.569
Now come on.
Go get your dress on.

40:49.572 --> 40:50.687
Can I finish the show?

40:50.698 --> 40:54.407
There's no time, shell.
Let's go. Chop-chop.

40:54.994 --> 40:56.780
Oh, put on the pretty one
with the ruffles.

40:56.788 --> 41:01.202
Oh, wait. No, no, no.
The one with the flowers.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.375
What a pretty little thing
you are.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.368
You know, when you grow up,

41:05.380 --> 41:08.543
you're gonna be
very, very beautiful.

41:08.549 --> 41:11.382
You're gonna meet a nice man,

41:11.386 --> 41:13.342
a good man.

41:13.346 --> 41:18.716
Someone who's loyal
and respects his vows.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.889
Not like your daddy.

41:23.773 --> 41:27.686
I don't like doing this, mom.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.102
I know.

41:30.113 --> 41:31.319
But sometimes,

41:31.322 --> 41:36.362
we all have to do things
we don't want to do, hmm?

41:38.162 --> 41:40.699
I don't want to do it.

41:40.707 --> 41:44.165
Sweetheart.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.704
Come here.

41:45.712 --> 41:48.545
Oh, it's okay.

41:48.548 --> 41:52.006
Oh, my little angel.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.968
Mommy loves you so much.

41:57.306 --> 42:00.969
Okay. Almost done.

42:00.977 --> 42:04.265
Mom, please.

or I will cut that tongue out.

42:25.752 --> 42:28.619
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I scared you.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.962
I'm sorry.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.422
I love you.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.542
Okay?

42:35.845 --> 42:38.837
Okay?

Okay.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.308
Oh, I see the car. All right.

42:44.312 --> 42:46.803
Scoot, scoot. Get to your room.

Oh, god.

How are my teeth?

43:26.437 --> 43:27.847
Very nice, very nice.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.268
Oh, are those new loafers?

43:31.275 --> 43:33.561
$500 gets me an hour, right?

43:33.569 --> 43:34.479
Yes, sir.

43:34.487 --> 43:35.772
Oh, would you like to try

43:35.780 --> 43:37.340
one of my freshly baked
vanilla cupcakes

43:40.118 --> 43:42.951
oh, probably terrible
for the pearly whites

43:42.954 --> 43:45.491
is what you're thinking.

43:46.749 --> 43:50.241
All right. Let's get started.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.130
All right. Here we are.

43:59.262 --> 44:02.425
Shell, you remember Don.

44:05.476 --> 44:08.138
Okay, well, I've got
to go tidy up that kitchen.

44:08.146 --> 44:09.602
I'll knock on the door at 7:30.

Hey, renda, it's Alice.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.287
I'm really sorry to call
last minute and cancel,

45:55.294 --> 45:57.706
but I'm just... I'm really
feeling under the weather,

45:57.755 --> 45:59.962
so if you just want
to call me back,

45:59.966 --> 46:01.547
then we can schedule a new time.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.838
All right. Thank you. Bye.

46:05.638 --> 46:09.301
Mm.

46:18.776 --> 46:23.440
- Shelly. Hi.
- Mm.

46:23.614 --> 46:27.232
Do you want to watch
something on TV?

46:27.994 --> 46:29.530
Oh, um...

46:29.537 --> 46:32.574
You know, honestly,
I have a throbbing headache.

46:32.581 --> 46:36.119
I'm really not feeling
very good.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.832
I can make you tea.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.297
That's very sweet of you,

46:43.301 --> 46:48.341
but I have a client coming over
later this afternoon, so I...

46:48.347 --> 46:53.182
You know, I-I should...
I should sleep.

46:53.561 --> 46:58.681
Tea will make you feel better
for this afternoon.

47:01.694 --> 47:05.186
Um, I really would hate
to trouble you.

47:05.197 --> 47:09.531
I know you have stuff
that you're doing, and...

47:10.328 --> 47:13.866
Mm. I don't mind.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.283
Mm, that's really sweet.

47:15.291 --> 47:18.203
Um, but I think I'm just...

47:18.210 --> 47:23.625
Not feeling up
for company, you know?

47:24.967 --> 47:28.880
Shelly:
Tea will make you feel better.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.302
Mmm. It's good.

Why does he keep calling you?

48:07.426 --> 48:11.635
I don't know.

48:15.059 --> 48:17.095
You should tell him to stop.

48:17.103 --> 48:19.810
Mm, yeah,
I have told him to stop,

48:19.814 --> 48:25.150
but I guess he just
doesn't want to stop.

48:28.697 --> 48:30.528
Why?

I don't know.

a nap right now.

I've got the client
coming over later, so...

49:08.612 --> 49:11.024
And this tea is helping.

49:11.031 --> 49:14.444
It's very good, so thank you.

49:18.539 --> 49:24.626
So, I'm just gonna go

Yeah, I'm sorry I wasn't
at the meeting earlier today.

53:22.825 --> 53:23.940
Miranda:
The moment you have kids,

53:23.951 --> 53:25.737
you start worrying
about everyone.

53:25.744 --> 53:27.109
I know, I know.
I should have texted.

53:27.121 --> 53:29.182
I've just... I've had a
million things I've been doing,

53:29.206 --> 53:31.913
and I've had, like, three
facials, and I had a bunch...

53:31.917 --> 53:35.830
Miranda: You're seeing him
again, aren't you?

53:36.839 --> 53:39.205
Alice.

Miranda: All right, all right.
You got to get to a meeting.

53:45.973 --> 53:50.307
I know. I just... I don't want
to go. They don't work.

53:50.310 --> 53:53.177
I don't understand
how I'm not supposed to see

53:53.188 --> 53:54.268
or talk to the man that I love.

53:54.273 --> 53:55.479
I don't get it. I can't do it.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.098
Miranda: Alice, why do you think
you keep having that dream?

53:58.110 --> 54:00.852
That's your subconscious
trying to tell you something...

54:00.863 --> 54:03.354
That you need
to get out of this.

54:03.365 --> 54:06.027
Yeah, well, I love him, okay?
It's not that...

54:06.034 --> 54:08.446

your disease talking.

54:08.454 --> 54:10.945
Well, you know,
life's not perfect, okay?

54:10.956 --> 54:13.117

isn't perfect,

a horse to water...

What is that supposed to mean?

more than this loser

Yes?

sometimes.

been your sponsor for years.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:23.727
