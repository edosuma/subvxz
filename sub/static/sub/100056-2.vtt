WEBVTT

00:02.215 --> 00:04.073
(CAROL AND JENNY LAUGHING)

00:04.074 --> 00:06.511
Oh, honey, this is so nice.

00:06.512 --> 00:08.671
The last time we were
in a hospital together,

00:08.672 --> 00:10.407
I was screaming and you were naked.

00:12.161 --> 00:13.685
I mean, isn't this fun?

00:13.686 --> 00:15.020
Now you get to keep me up to date

00:15.021 --> 00:16.230
on how work is going,

00:16.231 --> 00:17.355
who your friends are,

00:17.356 --> 00:18.514
who you're dating.

00:18.515 --> 00:20.204
And let's never forget that boundaries

00:20.205 --> 00:21.750
are also healthy and good.

00:21.751 --> 00:24.110
Okay.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.464
Morning, Dennis. It's
your favorite pharma rep

00:26.465 --> 00:28.524
with your favorite drug, caffeine.

00:28.525 --> 00:30.149
Thanks.

00:30.150 --> 00:33.119
Really keeps my morning pep going.

00:35.408 --> 00:37.366
Hot tip: Get in good with Nurse Dennis.

00:37.367 --> 00:39.325
He can make things here
a lot easier for you.

00:39.326 --> 00:42.385
Or much, much harder.

00:42.386 --> 00:44.344
Hey, Dennis. I paid for that coffee.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.478
Mm-hmm.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.565
I am so proud of you.

00:49.566 --> 00:51.356
I mean, when I tell people my mom became

00:51.357 --> 00:52.615
a doctor in her old...

00:52.616 --> 00:53.783
Late middle.

00:55.371 --> 00:57.062
... late middle age,

00:57.063 --> 00:58.387
they think it's amazing.

00:58.388 --> 00:59.846
Oh, thank you, Jenny.

00:59.847 --> 01:01.766
I got to say, after getting
through med school,

01:01.767 --> 01:03.826
it does feel pretty good to finally hear

01:03.827 --> 01:05.845
- people calling me...
- MAYA: Dr. Kenney!

01:05.846 --> 01:06.870
CAROL: Okay. Got to go.

01:06.871 --> 01:09.573
(LAUGHS) Have a great day,
sweetie. Sell lots of drugs.

01:11.377 --> 01:14.112
Thank you for joining us.
Let's get to assignments.

01:14.113 --> 01:15.714
There's only so many hours in a day

01:15.715 --> 01:17.582
and I'm guessing you're going
to eat into a lot of them.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.050
- Well, if I may...
- Case in point.

01:19.051 --> 01:20.176
Dr. Gilani.

01:20.177 --> 01:22.053
- Dr. Jacobs.
- Dr. Frost.

01:22.054 --> 01:23.221
Oh, so many doctors.

01:23.222 --> 01:24.424
We're all doctors.

01:25.947 --> 01:28.898
Dr. Jacobs, I'm wondering
if I might borrow

01:28.899 --> 01:30.562
one of your young chicks.

01:30.563 --> 01:32.597
- Personally, I would love...
- Dr. Kutcher.

01:32.598 --> 01:35.033
I never get tired of
hearing my own name.

01:36.469 --> 01:38.803
Very good. Come with me, Dr. Kutcher.

01:38.804 --> 01:41.873
Bye, all. Cream rises to the top.

01:41.874 --> 01:43.708
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:43.709 --> 01:45.777
Cream may rise to the top,

01:45.778 --> 01:49.047
but almond milk stays
good for way longer.

01:49.048 --> 01:51.383
So you're almond milk?

01:51.384 --> 01:52.886
Yeah, that's right. Back of the fridge.

01:52.887 --> 01:54.719
Not flashy like that oat milk.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.156
I'm gonna survive this year
by keeping a low profile.

01:58.157 --> 01:59.836
I'd like to keep a low profile,

01:59.837 --> 02:02.394
but I'm the only queer,
diverse person in the program.

02:02.395 --> 02:04.496
There are already six pictures of me

02:04.497 --> 02:07.232
- on the hospital website.
- Oh.

02:07.233 --> 02:09.134
Dr. Gilani, you'll be treating a patient

02:09.136 --> 02:10.735
in a medically induced coma.

02:10.735 --> 02:12.137
Okay. You all heard it.

02:12.138 --> 02:14.034
She was in a coma when I got her.

02:16.242 --> 02:18.009
- Dr. Kenney.
- Let me guess,

02:18.010 --> 02:19.177
more stool samples.

02:19.178 --> 02:20.812
Unfortunately, all the stools

02:20.813 --> 02:22.447
have been sampled.

02:22.448 --> 02:25.317
So you and Dr. Sommers
will be treating a patient.

02:25.318 --> 02:28.286
A patient?

02:28.287 --> 02:30.755
A real, live patient?

02:30.756 --> 02:33.658
Yes. Your patients will
always start out alive.

02:35.828 --> 02:37.862
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

02:37.863 --> 02:40.365
I would just like to savor this moment.

02:40.366 --> 02:42.033
Of course.

02:42.034 --> 02:44.703
It feels like it was just yesterday

02:44.704 --> 02:47.772
I was teaching a classroom
full of horny ninth-graders

02:47.773 --> 02:50.475
that amino acids are the
building blocks of life.

02:50.476 --> 02:54.145
And little did I know that
I would use the amino acids

02:54.146 --> 02:58.216
of my divorce to become a doctor

02:58.217 --> 03:01.853
about to see her first patient.

03:01.854 --> 03:04.789
She left after the first amino acids.

03:04.790 --> 03:06.791
Honestly,

03:06.792 --> 03:09.227
I didn't get horny
until the tenth grade.

03:18.909 --> 03:21.112
Ms. Zahn, I'm Dr. Kenney.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.143
This is Dr. Sommers,

03:22.144 --> 03:24.580
and we are thrilled to
be taking care of you.

03:24.581 --> 03:26.449
And I'm thrilled to see you.

03:26.450 --> 03:28.952
(LAUGHS) Usually, when
they see an old lady

03:28.953 --> 03:32.488
come through the door they just
stick me right with a newbie.

03:35.326 --> 03:39.095
Um, actually, you're
my very first patient.

03:39.096 --> 03:40.997
Took you a while to get through it, huh?

03:43.467 --> 03:46.369
Yeah. I kept mixing up
the liver and the lungs.

03:46.370 --> 03:48.137
- Wait...
- No, I... (LAUGHS)

03:48.138 --> 03:50.640
I'm-I'm joking, of course.

03:50.641 --> 03:52.008
Anyway, let's get down to business.

03:52.009 --> 03:54.377
You were admitted for
a fever. Is that right?

03:54.378 --> 03:56.304
Got up to 102.

03:56.305 --> 03:57.547
CAROL: That could be serious.

03:57.548 --> 03:59.475
Well, the meds are
bringing her fever down,

03:59.476 --> 04:00.783
but she's still flushed.

04:00.784 --> 04:04.053
Ms. Z, you wear it well.
You have beautiful skin.

04:04.054 --> 04:06.222
Tell me if anything
hurts, okay, Ms. Zahn?

04:06.223 --> 04:08.057
At my age, everything hurts.

04:08.058 --> 04:10.557
But you touch away.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.110
You know, Ms. Zahn,

04:14.111 --> 04:16.165
we don't have much
medical history for you.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.867
Who's your primary care physician?

04:17.868 --> 04:20.702
It used to be Dr. Bonner, but he died.

04:20.704 --> 04:23.897
- Oh.
- Or he moved to Death Valley.

04:23.898 --> 04:26.676
Or he moved to Death Valley

04:26.677 --> 04:27.745
and he died.

04:29.346 --> 04:32.146
Now I just see whoever's at the clinic.

04:32.147 --> 04:35.226
And it says here that you're
on propranolol and trazodone.

04:35.227 --> 04:36.519
Is there anything else?

04:36.520 --> 04:40.923
Well, sometimes I have a
drink of sherry in the evening.

04:41.659 --> 04:43.359
We'll, uh, we'll start
with some blood work

04:43.360 --> 04:44.494
and a chest X-ray.

04:44.495 --> 04:46.729
For now, you just try to rest. Okay?

04:46.730 --> 04:48.231
- Yeah.
- And if you want to watch TV,

04:48.232 --> 04:50.151
we have over three channels.

04:51.451 --> 04:53.703
Thank you. It's nice to rest.

04:53.704 --> 04:55.705
I'm just sick of these fevers.

04:55.706 --> 04:58.374
Fevers... plural?

04:58.375 --> 05:00.576
I had a few this month.

05:00.577 --> 05:03.179
Early in the month or late?

05:04.715 --> 05:07.884
Ms. Zahn? Linda?

05:07.885 --> 05:09.585
CALEB: Oh, my God.

05:09.586 --> 05:11.901
Did she just...

05:11.902 --> 05:14.495
- (SNORES)
- Oh...

05:14.496 --> 05:18.532
Oh! Dr. Jacobs specifically
told us to keep her alive.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.564
Way to keep us on task, Caleb.

05:23.934 --> 05:25.535
I'm so glad you got to hear

05:25.536 --> 05:28.571
that patient's polyphonic wheeze.

05:28.572 --> 05:31.405
Sounded like a mournful whale song.

05:33.110 --> 05:34.696
Hauntingly beautiful.

05:36.108 --> 05:37.533
- Perfect description, sir.
- Mm.

05:37.534 --> 05:38.881
Couldn't have said it better myself.

05:38.882 --> 05:41.150
The English language is
lucky to live in your mouth.

05:41.151 --> 05:42.652
Ah.

05:42.653 --> 05:46.029
So, what kind of complex,
highly technical procedure

05:46.030 --> 05:47.170
can I assist you with?

05:47.171 --> 05:49.125
Well, I'd just like you
to do some blood work.

05:50.358 --> 05:52.228
Did I hear lung biopsy?

05:52.229 --> 05:54.831
No, just the blood draw.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.666
Thank you.

05:58.168 --> 06:00.436
A blood draw? Is he kidding?

06:00.437 --> 06:01.938
Oh, are you worried you
won't be able to do that

06:01.939 --> 06:04.407
and kiss Dr. Frost's
butt at the same time?

06:04.408 --> 06:06.776
Blood draws are boring.

06:06.777 --> 06:08.111
It's nurse work.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.335
Dude, you offended Nurse Dennis.

06:15.336 --> 06:16.452
That's bad.

06:16.453 --> 06:19.622
The hierarchy in this hospital
goes: Nurse Dennis, Frost,

06:19.623 --> 06:22.992
other nurses, Dr. Jacobs,
patients, taco lady,

06:22.993 --> 06:24.994
guy who lives in the ER, us.

06:27.531 --> 06:28.798
You're overreacting.

06:28.799 --> 06:30.166
Nurse Dennis didn't even hear me.

06:30.167 --> 06:32.101
Did you see the face he made?

06:33.504 --> 06:35.338
That's the face he always makes.

06:35.339 --> 06:37.206
No.

06:37.207 --> 06:40.943
This is the "I just heard
what you said" face.

06:42.813 --> 06:44.046
Dr. Jacobs.

06:44.047 --> 06:46.983
Um, Ms. Zahn's blood work
and X-rays came back clean,

06:46.984 --> 06:48.484
and her temperature's back to normal.

06:48.485 --> 06:50.686
Excellent. You and Dr. Sommers
can discharge your patient.

06:50.687 --> 06:52.427
But-but she happened to mention that

06:52.428 --> 06:53.922
she had a few fevers this month,

06:53.923 --> 06:55.892
so I would like to keep
her for an abdominal CT.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.158
Does she have other symptoms?

06:57.159 --> 06:58.461
She has a dry patch

06:58.462 --> 07:00.062
on her left arm and achy joints.

07:00.063 --> 07:02.532
Oh, no. Does she have
loose skin and cloudy eyes?

07:02.533 --> 07:04.500
Yes, both of those things.

07:04.501 --> 07:05.701
I'm sorry to say, it sounds like she has

07:05.702 --> 07:07.537
an irreversible case of old.

07:09.573 --> 07:11.741
Wow, you made a joke.

07:11.742 --> 07:13.376
(GASPS)

07:15.355 --> 07:17.413
But I think there is something
more we could do.

07:17.414 --> 07:18.648
Dr. Kenney,

07:18.649 --> 07:20.678
I admire your commitment
to your patient,

07:20.679 --> 07:22.418
but we don't have unlimited beds.

07:22.419 --> 07:25.221
Hospital policy requires
that we discharge her.

07:25.222 --> 07:27.809
But I know there's
something more going on.

07:27.810 --> 07:28.834
Look,

07:28.835 --> 07:30.259
I did not become a doctor

07:30.260 --> 07:33.410
to have my very first patient,
who's an elderly woman with...

07:33.411 --> 07:35.412
Oh, again.

07:39.933 --> 07:41.971
Oh, hey, Dennis.

07:41.972 --> 07:44.073
Mm-hmm.

07:44.074 --> 07:46.323
So, the-the patient in 18

07:46.324 --> 07:48.070
is still waiting on that blood draw.

07:48.071 --> 07:50.446
Oh, is he, now?

07:50.447 --> 07:53.285
So if you could just...
get that sample soon,

07:53.286 --> 07:55.084
- that would be great.
- You got it.

07:55.085 --> 07:57.220
As soon as I'm done with my very...

07:57.221 --> 07:58.888
important paperwork.

08:00.891 --> 08:02.892
Is another nurse available?

08:02.893 --> 08:04.360
Everyone's got paperwork.

08:04.361 --> 08:06.958
Dennis, you got a second

08:06.959 --> 08:09.532
to help me prep for a
hemodialysis catheter?

08:09.533 --> 08:11.267
(CHUCKLES): Hey, I got nothing but time.

08:12.469 --> 08:14.470
You know, in fact,

08:14.471 --> 08:16.706
let me get two other nurses
to make sure we got it covered.

08:16.707 --> 08:18.608
Okay.

08:18.609 --> 08:20.943
(LAUGHS)

08:26.637 --> 08:28.751
Oh, hi, Mom! What brings you over here?

08:28.752 --> 08:30.620
- Oh, chips.
- Tough day?

08:30.621 --> 08:32.054
No, no. It's great.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.556
I got my first patient.

08:33.557 --> 08:35.758
Oh. I understand.

08:35.759 --> 08:37.559
(BOTH SIGH)

08:37.561 --> 08:41.797
It's crazy how quickly a life
can just slip away, isn't it?

08:41.798 --> 08:43.065
What are you talking about?

08:43.066 --> 08:44.232
She's not dead.

08:44.234 --> 08:45.635
Oh.

08:45.636 --> 08:47.470
Well, then, why are
you hoovering my chips?

08:48.848 --> 08:50.425
They're making me discharge

08:50.426 --> 08:52.619
an elderly woman with no diagnosis

08:52.620 --> 08:55.578
out into the street like
some really old orphan.

08:56.442 --> 08:58.511
Let's take this to my office.

08:58.512 --> 08:59.841
Why do you have an office?

08:59.842 --> 09:01.474
I technically don't,

09:01.475 --> 09:04.428
but these bags are a pain
to lug around all day,

09:04.429 --> 09:07.823
so I made an arrangement
with a dermatologist.

09:07.824 --> 09:09.158
Oh, Jenny.

09:09.159 --> 09:10.693
For an office?

09:10.694 --> 09:13.596
Mom. No! Ugh.

09:13.597 --> 09:16.265
I give him free hair loss
meds, and he lets me

09:16.266 --> 09:18.834
- use his office when he's not here.
- Oh.

09:18.835 --> 09:20.436
But isn't that against the rules?

09:20.437 --> 09:22.171
Mom, in a hospital, there are the rules,

09:22.172 --> 09:24.173
and then there's the
way things actually work.

09:24.174 --> 09:26.976
You just need to know
how to game the system.

09:26.977 --> 09:29.515
Huh. Good point.

09:29.516 --> 09:31.108
Thank you, Jenny.

09:31.109 --> 09:34.383
This has been a very
informative and helpful chat.

09:34.384 --> 09:36.297
Mom, are you trying to steal my chips?

09:36.298 --> 09:37.332
Bye-bye.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.825
Carol, this isn't a good idea.

09:42.826 --> 09:45.061
Caleb, we are not breaking any rules.

09:45.062 --> 09:47.897
We are making the system work for us.

09:47.898 --> 09:49.298
Hello, Dennis.

09:49.299 --> 09:51.400
This patient needs to be discharged.

09:51.401 --> 09:54.990
Uh, I know you're new here,
but usually we keep the beds.

09:56.609 --> 09:58.240
Well, I was actually reading up

09:58.241 --> 10:00.743
on Loyola's official
discharge protocol...

10:00.744 --> 10:02.511
(LAUGHS) Nerd alert.

10:04.390 --> 10:06.916
Apparently, if a doctor
deems it necessary,

10:06.917 --> 10:10.152
she can request a social worker
to discharge an elderly patient.

10:10.153 --> 10:13.055
And I am her doctor,
and I deem it necessary.

10:13.056 --> 10:14.323
Are you sure?

10:14.324 --> 10:15.802
Usually it takes at least a few hours

10:15.803 --> 10:17.226
for a social worker to get here.

10:17.227 --> 10:20.262
Oh, does it? Who'd have guessed?

10:20.263 --> 10:21.731
Sounds like you did.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.001
Looks like we got a
couple hours to kill.

10:26.002 --> 10:27.603
Let's get you an abdominal CT.

10:27.604 --> 10:30.239
Uh, I don't know about this.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.375
Hey, can you keep a secret?

10:32.376 --> 10:33.409
Not really.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.277
- Yep, I'm out.
- No, Caleb.

10:35.278 --> 10:37.947
Caleb, we'll get the CT.

10:37.948 --> 10:39.915
It'll show Dr. Jacobs that we're right.

10:39.916 --> 10:42.718
And then we will have been
the change we wish to see.

10:42.719 --> 10:44.754
Isn't that what the button
on your backpack says?

10:44.755 --> 10:46.222
All right, fine.

10:46.223 --> 10:48.290
Okay, Ms. Z, let's do this.

10:48.291 --> 10:49.625
(WHOOPS)

10:49.626 --> 10:52.027
Dennis, we were never here.

10:52.028 --> 10:53.716
Oh, how I wish that were true.

10:58.550 --> 11:02.244
Sorry. These beds do not
corner well. (GRUNTS)

11:02.245 --> 11:04.436
I had an Oldsmobile like this once.

11:04.437 --> 11:07.030
Took out a mailbox and a small family.

11:07.031 --> 11:10.324
Of gnomes. Garden gnomes.
I should lead with that.

11:10.325 --> 11:11.749
Anyway, it's a funny story.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.063
Unfortunately, it'll have to wait.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.184
Ms. Zahn, would you excuse us, please?

11:18.784 --> 11:20.584
Ooh, you're in a pickle.

11:25.534 --> 11:27.592
I ordered you to discharge your patient.

11:27.593 --> 11:29.193
I hope you have a very good explanation.

11:30.048 --> 11:31.439
I do. Dr. Sommers.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.751
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

11:33.752 --> 11:37.388
I believe Dr. Sommers has
the results of Ms. Zahn's CT,

11:37.389 --> 11:40.524
which will prove that there's
more going on with my patient.

11:40.525 --> 11:43.460
Dr. Sommers, the floor is yours.

11:43.461 --> 11:45.296
She's fine.

11:45.297 --> 11:47.064
What?

11:47.065 --> 11:49.733
But surely the results show
evidence of inflammation.

11:49.734 --> 11:50.853
Nope.

11:50.854 --> 11:53.500
Then they must have revealed an abscess,

11:53.501 --> 11:56.064
- indicating a bacterial infection.
- CALEB: They did not.

11:56.065 --> 11:57.929
- It's a tumor.
- The radiologist said

11:57.930 --> 11:59.810
she has the healthiest
intestine he's ever seen.

12:03.215 --> 12:04.615
In conclusion,

12:04.616 --> 12:08.452
I believe that this patient
should be discharged.

12:12.257 --> 12:14.491
That did not go as planned.

12:17.996 --> 12:19.763
Oh, hey, I was looking for you.

12:19.764 --> 12:21.198
Want to do a blood draw?

12:21.951 --> 12:23.832
Dude, why don't you just do it yourself?

12:23.833 --> 12:25.300
It'll be more fun if we do it together.

12:25.301 --> 12:26.468
Quickly, before Dr. Frost comes back.

12:26.469 --> 12:27.502
- Come on.
- Okay,

12:27.503 --> 12:28.970
either you're in love with me,

12:28.971 --> 12:30.806
or you don't know how
to do a blood draw.

12:32.375 --> 12:35.141
I... am in love with you.

12:36.846 --> 12:39.514
I knew it! You don't know
how to do a blood draw.

12:39.515 --> 12:40.615
Shh!

12:40.616 --> 12:41.850
You can't do a blood draw,

12:41.851 --> 12:43.185
Caleb got in off the wait list,

12:43.186 --> 12:46.154
Carol's an old lady. I
should be on that website.

12:46.952 --> 12:48.077
Be on the website.

12:48.078 --> 12:50.459
The poster, the side of the
bus, whatever, just help me.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.028
How did you not learn
to do a blood draw?

12:53.029 --> 12:55.499
I-I didn't learn it when
we started rotations

12:55.500 --> 12:56.631
in med school.

12:56.632 --> 12:58.066
And the later it got in the program,

12:58.067 --> 12:59.558
the more humiliating it was to ask.

12:59.559 --> 13:01.236
So you just never did?

13:01.237 --> 13:03.338
People do things for me.

13:09.178 --> 13:11.012
Because of my face and body.

13:11.013 --> 13:12.881
I was so close to wanting to help you.

13:12.882 --> 13:14.716
Will you please just do it?

13:14.717 --> 13:17.052
Just tell Frost the truth. He likes you.

13:17.053 --> 13:18.120
That's the point.

13:18.121 --> 13:19.821
He likes me because
he thinks I'm perfect.

13:19.822 --> 13:22.357
People don't like people with flaws.

13:23.559 --> 13:25.160
No offense, Lexie.

13:25.161 --> 13:27.829
Okay, you're on your own.

13:27.830 --> 13:30.398
Plus, your butt has no shape.

13:35.046 --> 13:37.772
Here's your discharge
instructions. Oh...

13:37.773 --> 13:39.040
and I also wrote down the name

13:39.041 --> 13:40.709
of that applesauce flavor you like.

13:40.710 --> 13:42.377
It's called "original".

13:44.013 --> 13:45.547
Um, I can see her out.

13:45.548 --> 13:48.517
You can, but will you?

13:48.518 --> 13:50.619
Okay, Ms. Zahn, before you go

13:50.620 --> 13:53.455
I just want to make sure
everything is taken care of.

13:53.456 --> 13:55.793
So, you took your propranolol
before you came in this morning?

13:55.794 --> 13:58.560
Yeah. While I was watching <i>Judge Judy.</i>

13:59.785 --> 14:01.863
Well, that means it's past
time for your next dose.

14:01.864 --> 14:02.964
Can we help you with that?

14:02.965 --> 14:04.366
Sure. They're in my handbag.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.568
Okay.

14:09.045 --> 14:11.573
Ms. Zahn, what is this?

14:11.574 --> 14:12.807
A pillbox.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.309
You <i>are</i> new.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.279
No, but I mean, what's in it?

14:17.280 --> 14:19.447
Your paperwork only
listed two medications.

14:19.448 --> 14:21.575
There's at least ten in here.

14:21.576 --> 14:23.919
You know, Dr. Jacobs, this
could be related to the fevers.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.211
It's worth looking into.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.222
Ms. Zahn, can you
tell us what these are?

14:27.223 --> 14:28.757
Pills.

14:31.492 --> 14:33.717
Thanks for helping us, Jenny.

14:33.718 --> 14:35.043
Beautiful office.

14:35.044 --> 14:38.306
You're so young to have
two teenage, Asian children.

14:38.307 --> 14:39.968
Yup.

14:39.969 --> 14:41.994
They're a handful. (LAUGHS)

14:41.995 --> 14:44.005
Isn't this Dr. Morikawa's office?

14:44.006 --> 14:45.941
Oh, he and I have an arrangement.

14:45.942 --> 14:47.576
Oh, Jenny, for an office?

14:48.844 --> 14:50.840
Do I have a reputation?

14:52.020 --> 14:53.682
Anyway, this one's heparin.

14:53.683 --> 14:54.881
This is Trazodone.

14:54.882 --> 14:56.785
This is a jelly bean,
probably watermelon.

14:56.786 --> 14:58.008
Possibly green apple?

14:58.009 --> 15:00.088
- This is Caratriptan. This...
- Wait.

15:00.089 --> 15:01.656
She's on a triptan?

15:01.657 --> 15:02.857
That could explain the fevers.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.292
Thank you, Jenny.

15:04.293 --> 15:06.261
You really know your stuff.

15:06.262 --> 15:07.480
Yeah. I made her.

15:08.364 --> 15:09.927
Don't make this about you, Dr. Kenney.

15:11.033 --> 15:13.468
(MOUTHS)

15:18.207 --> 15:21.142
Boom! Guess what's more
helpful than you, Lexie?

15:21.143 --> 15:23.144
The Internet. Look
what I found on YouTube.

15:23.145 --> 15:24.479
"How to draw blood".

15:24.480 --> 15:26.209
Oh, great. Then, let's learn

15:26.210 --> 15:28.271
how to do a tracheotomy from Pinterest.

15:29.952 --> 15:32.787
Okay, who wants to learn?

15:32.788 --> 15:34.623
Wait, did you set this up?

15:34.624 --> 15:36.725
No. I did.

15:36.726 --> 15:37.993
Look at my face and body.

15:40.496 --> 15:42.964
No need to panic, Dr. Kutcher.

15:42.965 --> 15:46.219
Every year there's a smart
dummy like you who didn't learn

15:46.220 --> 15:49.237
a basic technique in school
and is afraid to admit it.

15:49.238 --> 15:50.639
Wait, so you knew?

15:50.640 --> 15:52.374
I know everything.

15:52.375 --> 15:55.010
Also, I saw it on your face
when you mentioned the draw.

15:55.011 --> 15:58.575
Then I told Nurse Dennis,
and we had a good laugh.

15:58.576 --> 16:00.982
(LAUGHTER)

16:00.983 --> 16:02.484
And then I told the other nurses,

16:02.485 --> 16:04.849
and then <i>we</i> had a good laugh.

16:04.850 --> 16:06.175
Good news is,

16:06.176 --> 16:09.057
this is a teaching
hospital, so after this,

16:09.058 --> 16:11.026
you'll practice on a couple of patients.

16:11.027 --> 16:12.761
And then on me.

16:12.762 --> 16:16.097
I'll warn you now, I have shy veins.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.334
Left arm out, Doctor.

16:19.335 --> 16:21.936
Wait, you're... wait,
you're teaching me on me?

16:21.937 --> 16:24.339
(CHUCKLES) Well, I'm not
gonna let you learn on me.

16:24.340 --> 16:29.444
Now, the only part that hurts
is when you can't find the vein.

16:29.445 --> 16:32.511
Let's start by pretending
I'm not good at this.

16:32.512 --> 16:35.550
(LAUGHS): Okay. Hold on,
I want to record this.

16:35.551 --> 16:37.886
Uh, Dr. Gilani.

16:37.887 --> 16:39.687
You'll get a much
better angle over here.

16:43.759 --> 16:46.023
- The Caratriptan... your headache pill...
- Mm-hmm?

16:46.024 --> 16:48.063
... was interacting
with your other pills,

16:48.064 --> 16:50.136
increasing the serotonin
levels in your body

16:50.137 --> 16:51.524
which caused the fevers.

16:51.525 --> 16:52.801
Wow.

16:52.802 --> 16:55.270
You must think I'm a real pill popper.

16:55.271 --> 16:57.972
Oh, not at all.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.014
You just had too many
different drugs being prescribed

17:00.015 --> 17:01.242
by too many different doctors.

17:01.243 --> 17:02.811
And none of them handsome.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.523
Well, since you've been readmitted,

17:06.525 --> 17:09.324
I am going to represcribe
all your medications

17:09.325 --> 17:11.439
and get you a primary care physician.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.221
- Oh...
- I'll try to find a handsome one.

17:13.222 --> 17:14.455
(LAUGHS)

17:14.457 --> 17:16.057
Thank you so much.

17:16.058 --> 17:18.593
You know, I'm glad I got the newbie.

17:18.594 --> 17:20.295
You're a great doctor,

17:20.296 --> 17:24.132
even if it did take you 30
years to get through med school.

17:24.133 --> 17:26.568
You know, I did my best.

17:26.569 --> 17:27.836
- Mm-hmm.
- (MOUTHS)

17:29.271 --> 17:31.906
Well, I did it. Cured
my very first patient.

17:31.907 --> 17:33.241
And what's even better,

17:33.242 --> 17:35.276
we resolved our conflict. It's done.

17:35.277 --> 17:36.945
So, good night?

17:36.946 --> 17:39.355
Dr. Kenney, you disregarded my orders.

17:39.356 --> 17:41.116
Hospital protocols exist for a reason.

17:41.117 --> 17:42.517
Okay, but let's talk.

17:42.518 --> 17:44.786
What is someone like
Ms. Zahn supposed to do?

17:44.787 --> 17:46.621
She had nobody looking out for her.

17:46.622 --> 17:49.157
Old people are constantly
being dismissed

17:49.158 --> 17:51.599
and treated like they're
invisible. Believe me, I know.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.515
I mean, can you even
imagine what it feels like

17:53.516 --> 17:54.716
to be marginalized?

17:58.087 --> 18:00.268
- I knew it the minute I said it.
- Yeah.

18:00.269 --> 18:02.140
But I mean, we helped her.

18:02.141 --> 18:03.971
Isn't that what we're
supposed to be doing?

18:03.972 --> 18:05.440
Yes, and I'm glad.

18:05.441 --> 18:07.542
But what will you do next week
when you have seven patients?

18:07.543 --> 18:10.478
Or ten? Neglect them all to help one?

18:11.337 --> 18:12.777
Okay, I understand.

18:12.778 --> 18:13.882
And I will work overtime

18:13.883 --> 18:15.674
to get all the work done that I missed.

18:15.675 --> 18:17.875
Oh, you'll do more
than that. Since I spent

18:17.876 --> 18:19.988
all my time chasing you today,

18:19.989 --> 18:21.689
my patient notes didn't get done.

18:21.690 --> 18:23.104
So now you...

18:24.638 --> 18:25.872
get to do them.

18:30.733 --> 18:32.333
Did Dr. Jacobs leave?

18:32.334 --> 18:34.135
- Yeah. She's gone.
- (EXHALES)

18:34.136 --> 18:35.804
What did she say?

18:35.805 --> 18:37.628
Unfortunately, she was upset,

18:37.629 --> 18:39.912
and she wants you to
do all of this tonight.

18:39.913 --> 18:41.209
(GROANS)

18:41.210 --> 18:43.845
But don't worry, I will help you.

18:46.549 --> 18:48.349
- This is the hardest one.
- Aww.

18:51.794 --> 18:54.681
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Loyola Memorial's

18:54.682 --> 18:58.993
debut film festival screening
of <i>Daniel Can't Do Things.</i>

18:58.994 --> 19:00.361
- (WHOOPS)
- (CHUCKLES)

19:00.362 --> 19:02.163
- Okay, just get on with it, please.
- Shh.

19:02.164 --> 19:04.133
Daniel, I like to hear the artist speak.

19:04.134 --> 19:07.202
I agree. What inspired
you to make this film?

19:07.203 --> 19:08.536
- Well...
- I hope we're not late.

19:08.537 --> 19:10.038
- I brought popcorn.
- Mmm.

19:10.039 --> 19:12.073
Please silence your cell phones,

19:12.074 --> 19:14.317
and Carol, please
unwrap your hard candies.

19:14.318 --> 19:17.462
Okay, you think I have hard
candy just because I'm over 50?

19:17.463 --> 19:18.635
That's ageist.

19:19.715 --> 19:21.749
You want the candy or no?

19:21.750 --> 19:25.086
- Fine.
- (LAUGHTER)

19:25.087 --> 19:27.255
Now let's get ready

19:27.256 --> 19:29.858
to watch a grown man cry.

19:29.859 --> 19:31.259
Okay, that's not how...

19:31.260 --> 19:33.261
(ALL SHUSHING)

19:39.623 --> 19:41.549
Eh, be brave. Come on.

19:41.550 --> 19:44.409
Come on. Here we go.

19:44.410 --> 19:47.837
Little bit of rubbing alcohol... ooh.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.133
Huh? (LAUGHS)

19:50.134 --> 19:52.872
- (LAUGHS) I was pretending to drink the alcohol.
- (WHOOPS)

19:52.873 --> 19:54.741
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:55.963 --> 19:58.398
Camera's a little shaky.
Was that an artistic choice?

19:58.399 --> 20:00.100
- No, I couldn't stop laughing.
- Oh.

20:00.101 --> 20:01.568
(LAUGHTER)

20:01.569 --> 20:03.222
Oh, man, I'm surprised
you didn't pass out

20:03.223 --> 20:04.444
from all the blood loss.

20:04.445 --> 20:07.073
Oh, he was a real little trooper.

20:09.076 --> 20:10.277
It was okay.

20:14.782 --> 20:16.249
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

20:16.250 --> 20:18.134
Excuse me. Why don't
you show them the part

20:18.135 --> 20:19.819
where I actually do a blood draw?

20:19.820 --> 20:21.754
Nobody wants to see that.
Let's watch it again.

20:21.755 --> 20:23.556
(CHEERING)
