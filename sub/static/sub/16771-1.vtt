04:39.646 --> 04:42.012
That's real kind of you, Roger...

04:42.115 --> 04:44.345
but isn't it too hot for that kind of work?

04:44.651 --> 04:46.585
No, ma'am, Miss Sanders.

04:49.055 --> 04:52.547
- Come in for a cold drink.
- Soon as I finish this bunch.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.487
I don't know how Roger can work
in this awful heat.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.097
It's going up to 90 today.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.432
It feels like that already.

05:05.872 --> 05:09.603
Check the garage.
I hope nothing got flooded in the shop.

05:10.843 --> 05:13.403
I stacked everything off the floor last night.

05:14.514 --> 05:18.280
For heaven's sake! The fridge is out, too.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.381
All the food will spoil.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.990
Where did you meet this Mitch, anyhow?

05:26.526 --> 05:29.188
Mick. And I told you, at the dealers' show.

05:29.295 --> 05:30.785
He was browsing around.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.228
And came all the way down here
just to look for antiques?

05:35.702 --> 05:39.035
He has a five-day vacation
he'd rather spend in the country...

05:39.472 --> 05:42.532
What's the matter?
What's wrong with him coming here?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.773
Honey, I...

05:46.412 --> 05:47.379
God!

05:52.385 --> 05:54.444
All right, I won't butt in.

05:55.955 --> 05:59.891
I just don't want you to be too disappointed
if he doesn't come.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.991
Maybe the bus from the airport
can't get through.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.636
My nerves are still jumping
from all that thunder.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.203
I never saw such a storm.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.975
Something evil about it.

06:26.586 --> 06:30.386
...and north of Statesboro are flooded out
and blocked with fallen trees.

06:31.491 --> 06:34.358
Weather forecast calls for hot weather
today and tomorrow.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.560
Oh, no! What now?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.669
Here's the latest bulletin
on last night's storm.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.965
Most of the damage,
we're told, was caused...

06:48.541 --> 06:51.476
Do you think Roger
would let me borrow his truck?

06:51.778 --> 06:54.906
That way I can cut through the woods
and meet Mick on Route 41.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.244
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

06:58.551 --> 07:01.679
Most of the damage
caused by the storm was due to the wind...

07:01.821 --> 07:04.654
that blew almost everything over
that wasn't nailed down.

07:07.026 --> 07:10.894
Can't wait to meet this guy.
You've been yakking about him all week.

07:11.297 --> 07:12.628
I have not.

07:12.732 --> 07:13.824
That's just fine.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.899
The sink is acting up.

07:17.303 --> 07:19.396
What else can go wrong around here?

07:25.077 --> 07:27.511
Can I ask you a big, big favor?

07:27.814 --> 07:29.873
Where did you get that shirt?

07:30.650 --> 07:32.641
Been out robbing corpses again?

07:34.654 --> 07:36.087
How's your pimples?

07:40.426 --> 07:42.826
I have someone to pick up on Route 41.

07:43.029 --> 07:46.465
The roads are flooded,
but I can make it if I can borrow your truck.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.828
I'll drive you there.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.368
What's the matter,
afraid I can't handle it myself?

07:50.470 --> 07:54.031
Ma, where's Mick gonna sleep?

07:54.507 --> 07:55.997
In Geri's room?

07:57.376 --> 07:59.810
He'll sleep on the cot in the extra room.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.545
I promise I'll be real careful.

08:05.351 --> 08:07.717
You can borrow to loan the truck, but...

08:08.387 --> 08:11.618
be careful with them crates.
I got a full shipment in there.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.984
Okey-doke.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.218
Will you pick up some ice at Henley's?

08:16.329 --> 08:19.230
Lord knows
when the fridge will go on again.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.096
Bad move.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.106
I'm sorry, folks.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.271
We're gonna have to turn around
and go back to Poolerville.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.873
There's a tree across the road up here,
and it's all flooded out.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.853
Wait a minute. I'll get off here.

09:20.927 --> 09:21.894
Hang on.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.240
Sorry. Excuse me.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.690
- Would you have any maps of the area?
- Where you going?

09:54.794 --> 09:56.091
Fly Creek.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.262
It's straight ahead, about five miles.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.566
Flooded out.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.033
You're going to need a boat
to go over there.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.434
You probably got one somewhere.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.541
Now, there's another way you can go.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.176
Right through the woods, here.
It's half a mile.

10:15.281 --> 10:19.115
But you'll need a compass to go there.
You should have one of them, too.

10:28.027 --> 10:28.994
By the way...

10:29.095 --> 10:32.496
you wouldn't know where there's
a men's room around here, would you?

11:52.078 --> 11:54.979
Hi, Geri. How you been?

12:09.762 --> 12:12.663
I'll get you some dry clothes
when we get back to the house.

12:27.713 --> 12:29.874
You come prepared, don't you?

12:31.917 --> 12:35.512
I just picked up a few things.
Where did you get this?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.955
You like my truck?

12:50.136 --> 12:52.195
What kind of bait does Willie sell?

12:52.304 --> 12:55.273
It's my neighbor's truck.
He runs a worm farm.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.140
A worm farm? People eat them?

13:02.681 --> 13:05.172
No, dummy. They raise them for bait.

13:06.085 --> 13:09.680
Tell me about your trip.
Did you have a good time on that airplane?

13:10.189 --> 13:12.714
I was so worried
about you during that storm.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.123
I guess I missed it.

13:15.227 --> 13:18.094
We had clear sailing
till we hit the turnoff to Fly Creek.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.755
Then they had to let me off.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.231
Wait a minute, how did you get here?

13:22.368 --> 13:24.302
I took a shortcut through the woods.

13:24.403 --> 13:27.429
A bus could never make it
through here though. Hang on!

13:32.378 --> 13:34.608
I got the greatest place to show you.

13:34.713 --> 13:38.205
It's the greatest antique store in town.
You're just gonna love it.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.451
I promised Mama I'd stop and get some ice.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.616
All our electricity is out. Phones, too.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.894
- It must have been a dilly of a storm.
- It sure was a dilly.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.193
I never saw so much
thunder and lightning in my life.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.804
- I'm sorry I missed it.
- It was beautiful.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.103
I like a good thunderstorm.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.243
Makes you feel helpless.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.112
I'll be right back.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.985
What about the Cutters?

14:53.425 --> 14:57.122
- They always had trouble with those floods.
- They took the brunt of it.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.356
I hear Old Wally had to come on a row boat.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.533
I heard the whole electrical tower
came down.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.326
Lucky it didn't start a fire.

15:04.536 --> 15:06.561
All that juice pouring into the ground.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.606
Over 300,000 volts.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.108
When are they going to get
those lines back up?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.276
Before I go out of business, I hope.

15:14.380 --> 15:18.248
They're sending men from Statesboro.
They promised to have it back by tomorrow.

15:18.350 --> 15:21.319
In the meantime,
all that electricity going into the ground.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.352
And guess who's paying for it.

15:27.192 --> 15:28.352
Yeah, honey.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.725
I'd like a large egg cream,
and a glass of water, please.

15:32.665 --> 15:36.101
I've got water.
But what did you say? An "aik cream"?

15:37.436 --> 15:41.964
An egg cream. It's just chocolate syrup,
a little milk, and some seltzer water.

15:42.741 --> 15:43.833
A chocolate soda.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.106
That's it. With just a little shot of milk
to give it a head.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.080
That was the worst storm we've had
since I was knee-high to a duck.

15:52.184 --> 15:55.676
We had six turkeys up there at the house,
and they were out in the field.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.916
Five of those turkeys
was stripped of every feather they had.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.993
And that old turkey gobbler
didn't have a feather off of him.

16:02.094 --> 16:05.086
Turkey hens stood up there
and flapped their wings...

16:05.197 --> 16:06.186
How's that?

16:06.298 --> 16:08.960
...trying to hide themselves
like five old maids...

16:09.068 --> 16:11.662
There was that storm we had
about three years ago.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.567
All that thunder and lightning.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.732
It scared them tourists
slap out of 10 years growth.

16:16.842 --> 16:20.243
I haven't seen anybody rowing
to get that fast off that bay.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.611
They looked like the south end
of a northbound mule.

16:28.053 --> 16:30.112
There's a worm in my egg cream.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.797
If you didn't like the drink,
you should have said so.

16:43.902 --> 16:46.268
I've got enough problems
here without comedians.

16:46.405 --> 16:49.238
What? I found it in the glass.
I didn't put it there!

16:49.508 --> 16:52.705
I keep this place spotless.
This has never happened before.

16:53.412 --> 16:56.506
It happened now.
It's not a good way to win new customers.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.082
You know what I mean?

17:05.656 --> 17:09.058
Why did you go and do
a juvenile thing like that?

17:14.400 --> 17:17.164
- Where you from?
- From the city, I'll bet.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.833
I don't want your money.
I just want you to leave.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.239
Don't you think an apology is in order?

17:29.415 --> 17:31.007
Apologize for what?

17:31.283 --> 17:33.376
For finding a worm in my egg cream?

17:34.153 --> 17:36.519
What business do you have in Fly Creek?

17:39.158 --> 17:42.059
No business. Just pleasure.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.429
Oh, my goodness.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.106
I got the last piece.

17:55.641 --> 17:59.270
I don't know what I'm gonna do with this.
It's gonna fall off here.

17:59.611 --> 18:01.442
You're gonna have to hold it.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.375
I can't get any wetter than I already am.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.384
I'm sorry.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.589
Why is everybody around here
so unfriendly?

18:20.265 --> 18:25.066
They're very nice people, really.
It's just that they're suspicious of strangers.

18:25.471 --> 18:28.668
The tourists come
and they pollute the bay and the lagoon.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.038
I'm not a tourist. I'm a Libra.

18:49.027 --> 18:51.154
Mama, this is Mick.

18:52.264 --> 18:53.822
This is my sister, Alma.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.060
Mick got off the bus and fell in the swamp.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.762
He's soaked clean through,
even his suitcases.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.641
You can give him
some of Daddy's old clothes.

19:05.744 --> 19:08.838
They're upstairs in the trunk
in the storage room.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.877
They'll be kind of big, though.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.543
- Where do I put this?
- In the kitchen.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.929
Wait till you see Mr. Beardsley's place.
He's got the greatest old stuff.

19:26.231 --> 19:29.098
And he's real reasonable.
You can bargain with him.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.100
Oh, my Lord. I forgot.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.569
The clocks have stopped.
What time do you have?

19:34.506 --> 19:35.632
11:20.

19:35.874 --> 19:38.035
I arranged to meet him at his house at 11:30.

19:38.143 --> 19:40.236
- We'll have to hurry.
- Wait a minute.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.074
What about seeing the stuff in your garage?

19:43.215 --> 19:45.877
- We'll see that when we get back.
- Wait.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.854
- How you doing?
- Just fine.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.532
We're taking the car to Beardsley's.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.135
What about the dry clothes?

20:06.471 --> 20:08.701
I guess it'll just have to wait till later.

20:14.279 --> 20:16.179
What makes you think
you're better than me?

20:16.281 --> 20:17.305
You got nothing.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.852
You can either work with me,
or you don't work with me.

20:21.687 --> 20:24.747
You know nothing, you never will,
and you'll never know nothing.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.050
That's right.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.855
- Don't know what you're doing.
- I still got this place!

20:31.763 --> 20:34.357
When somebody passes away,
Mr. Beardsley moves in...

20:34.466 --> 20:37.867
and he gets the greatest stuff.
Ship rope, sideboards, brass beds.

20:38.604 --> 20:42.233
- I wonder what's happening over there?
- They're always fighting.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.600
That's Willie Grimes and his son, Roger.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.644
They own the worm farm.

20:47.980 --> 20:52.679
Old Willie's a sorry son of a gun.
He's always hounding Roger to do things.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.831
I'm responsible for that truck.

21:14.273 --> 21:18.175
I only borrowed you to loan that truck
'cause you said you'd be careful.

21:20.746 --> 21:22.179
What's wrong?

21:29.955 --> 21:33.220
Them crates is all empty.
Every damn last damn one of them.

21:34.059 --> 21:37.790
But I never left the truck except to get ice.

21:39.731 --> 21:41.198
It's strange to me.

21:42.067 --> 21:45.332
- I didn't let them out.
- lf you didn't, then who did?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.711
How many worms were there?

21:54.813 --> 21:58.510
I can tell you how many worms there was.
There was 100,000 worms.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.845
Cost me over $300, sonny boy.

22:02.521 --> 22:05.615
Maybe the door was loose
and you forgot to close the crates.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.659
Damn right.
He'd forget his head if it wasn't fastened.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.490
He doesn't have his mind on business
at all these days.

22:13.365 --> 22:16.425
I'm trying to run a business,
and you will not...

22:16.535 --> 22:20.938
lend my truck to nobody, no time, no more.

22:21.773 --> 22:25.209
It's gonna take me the rest of the week
to replace those worms...

22:25.310 --> 22:27.471
if I can replace those worms.

22:28.880 --> 22:33.010
You're gonna dig deep, and I mean deep.
Down to your toenails.

22:43.395 --> 22:46.853
I'm real sorry. Is there anything I can do?

22:53.905 --> 22:55.896
We'll see you later, then. Okay?

23:20.632 --> 23:23.328
Maybe we can help replace them somehow.

23:24.336 --> 23:29.137
- 100,000 worms?
- What's the matter? Afraid of worms?

23:29.808 --> 23:31.901
What, me? Afraid of worms?

23:33.512 --> 23:34.501
Yeah.

23:34.613 --> 23:38.105
Nothing to be afraid of,
long as you hold them by the tail.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.148
- Why's that?
- They bite.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.278
Worms around here, all Glycera.

23:44.856 --> 23:47.416
Bloodworms,
and sandworms from the ocean.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.527
But how do you know which end is the tail?

23:51.196 --> 23:53.756
The end opposite the one that bites you.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.808
- Does anybody else live here?
- He lives all alone.

24:46.751 --> 24:48.184
Kind of spooky.

25:18.583 --> 25:19.948
Where is he?

25:34.032 --> 25:35.761
Mr. Beardsley, is that you?

25:56.021 --> 25:57.215
What happened?

26:00.992 --> 26:04.018
- Who do you suppose it is?
- I have no idea.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.300
I think one of us ought to go get the Sheriff.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.370
I'll stay here, okay?

26:27.385 --> 26:29.353
I think I better go with you.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.752
How about a piece of jewelry?

26:37.162 --> 26:40.689
A pin, a bracelet, or something like that.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.932
Why don't you show me something?

26:45.570 --> 26:46.969
I don't know.

26:47.505 --> 26:49.564
Something for Julia, I expect.

26:54.379 --> 26:57.746
Geraldine knows much more
about the jewelry than I do.

27:00.919 --> 27:02.181
Here she is now.

27:03.555 --> 27:06.718
Sheriff Reston wants to pick up
a little something for Mrs. Reston.

27:06.992 --> 27:09.961
We were just looking for you.
This is my friend, Mick.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.092
We've met.

27:12.397 --> 27:15.195
We found a skeleton back at Mr. Beardsley's.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.065
Show it to Beardsley.
He'll give you top dollar for it.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.569
He wasn't around.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.966
I think you ought to take a look at it.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.370
I intend to.

27:34.919 --> 27:37.046
- Which way?
- Around the back.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.798
It's right over here.

27:57.375 --> 27:59.639
I don't know what you're up to.

28:00.011 --> 28:03.310
But you sure as hell ain't gonna pull
this bull in Fly Creek.

28:04.049 --> 28:06.574
I want you the hell out of this town.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.279
But it was right here. We both saw it.

28:09.988 --> 28:11.353
That's enough.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.390
I'd expect this bull from your sister,
but not you.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.656
Your daddy was real proud of you.

28:16.761 --> 28:20.197
If he were alive and saw you now,
he'd tan your fanny.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.122
She didn't do anything.

28:22.667 --> 28:25.636
I'm gonna let this go, 'cause it's too hot.

28:26.104 --> 28:29.540
I'm too busy to book this little city weasel.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.703
I got a goddamn town
to put back together again.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.976
But if I see you even one more time...

28:42.987 --> 28:45.615
you won't even be able
to call a city lawyer...

28:47.592 --> 28:49.753
'cause all the phones are dead.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.222
"'Cause all the phones"...

29:11.116 --> 29:13.676
I don't understand. It just didn't walk away.

29:16.454 --> 29:18.183
But whose skeleton was it?

29:19.124 --> 29:21.718
Could be from the Revolutionary War,
for all we know.

29:23.661 --> 29:25.128
What do you think?

29:25.764 --> 29:30.201
That's not all too sharp, unless
you want to blend in with the Creekers.

29:30.568 --> 29:33.332
- What's a Creeker?
- Fly Creek people.

29:35.306 --> 29:37.570
Smoking in Fly Creek is a bust.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.975
- Have you met Sheriff Reston yet?
- You mean the guy with the teeth?

29:42.647 --> 29:45.138
Right. Too much.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.310
- You got a match?
- Yeah, I do.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.316
- Here, keep them.
- Quigley's.

30:06.437 --> 30:07.927
You've been there?

30:09.574 --> 30:11.405
Quigley's is a pisser.

30:12.310 --> 30:15.643
I go there with some of my friends,
stoned out of our gourds.

30:15.747 --> 30:19.615
We just sit around and watch the old farts
drink themselves into a stupor.

30:24.823 --> 30:28.122
- That been itching like that for long?
- No, it just started.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.692
About Beardsley, the antique dealer...

30:35.967 --> 30:38.197
- Does he go to Quigley's?
- Go there?

30:39.204 --> 30:40.364
He lives there.

30:41.072 --> 30:44.132
Aaron Beardsley is a stone-cold alchy.

30:52.116 --> 30:53.640
There we go.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.919
You must like Geri a whole lot.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.691
Come all the way down here from the city.

31:11.469 --> 31:13.403
- No, thanks.
- Save it for later.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.870
- You're gonna need it.
- Yeah? Why?

31:16.941 --> 31:18.932
That stuff on your leg...

31:21.079 --> 31:22.706
it's poison ivy.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.793
- Hey, Roger.
- Hi, Geraldine.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.192
Hi, Mr. Quigley, how're you?

31:38.329 --> 31:40.490
What're you all drinking?
Beer's warm today.

31:40.598 --> 31:45.194
I'm looking for...
We're looking for Aaron Beardsley.

31:45.703 --> 31:46.965
Has he been around?

31:47.071 --> 31:49.665
No. I haven't seen Aaron
since last night's storm.

31:49.774 --> 31:53.107
He left about the time
it really started coming down.

31:54.846 --> 31:56.336
You looking for antiques?

31:56.447 --> 31:58.779
You're a nice looking fella.
Let me give you a tip.

31:58.883 --> 32:00.350
Stay away from old Aaron.

32:00.752 --> 32:05.382
He's a little steep, if you know what I mean.
I got a whole garage full of stuff, out back.

32:05.857 --> 32:09.384
Enough to make your mouth water
like a horse with his nose in a sugar bag.

32:09.494 --> 32:11.758
- Mr. Quigley...
- Just a minute.

32:14.299 --> 32:18.633
This was worn by John Wayne.
He used this in Reap the Wild Wind...

32:23.975 --> 32:25.840
We'll stop by if we have time.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.504
If you see Mr. Beardsley,
you tell him we're looking for him.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.412
He'll be around, all right.
You can rest assured of that.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.586
- I'm sorry about those worms.
- Just forget it.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.424
Geri and I are going fishing.
Do you want to come with us?

32:44.729 --> 32:46.924
I bet you know all the best spots.

32:48.032 --> 32:49.624
Come on, Roger.

32:49.734 --> 32:52.635
It'd be better if you stay away
from your father for a while.

32:54.038 --> 32:57.496
- When you going to do it?
- After lunch, about an hour.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.078
I'll just get some stuff and things
over at the bait shop.

33:06.884 --> 33:09.216
- I'll meet you down by the boat.
- Okay.

33:09.821 --> 33:13.052
Great! And you can show me
how to use the new reel I bought.

33:13.391 --> 33:14.619
Let's go.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.457
Everybody in Fly Creek
fancies himself a latent antique dealer.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.795
Nobody throws anything away.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.770
You never know what the tourists want.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.377
Guess what this tourist wants.

33:39.617 --> 33:42.051
Tuna fish salad will have to do for now.

33:46.290 --> 33:47.587
That looks good.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.382
My specialty.

33:58.803 --> 34:01.397
Do you suppose something happened
to Mr. Beardsley?

34:01.506 --> 34:02.564
Probably not.

34:02.673 --> 34:06.370
I bet we see him boozing it up tonight
in a dark corner in Quigley's.

34:06.477 --> 34:09.344
- You really plan on going back there?
- Sure.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.813
- There was a worm in my egg cream.
- What?

34:22.393 --> 34:25.851
Today, when I went into that luncheonette,
I ordered an egg cream...

34:26.898 --> 34:30.061
- and there was a worm in it.
- What's an egg cream?

34:31.202 --> 34:32.726
It's like a chocolate...

34:35.440 --> 34:37.567
Maybe it was my fault, after all.

34:39.476 --> 34:43.708
Maybe that had something to do
with the worms in the truckload.

34:59.497 --> 35:00.862
Do you see Roger around?

35:04.302 --> 35:07.066
He's probably at the dock
getting the boat ready.

35:29.494 --> 35:34.022
- The skeleton! How did it get here?
- I don't know.

35:35.399 --> 35:38.266
If it's the same one.
They all look alike to me.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.434
It's Mr. Grimes.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.711
Let's tell Sheriff Reston.

36:28.553 --> 36:29.884
Tell him what?

36:32.123 --> 36:34.216
If only we knew whose bones those are.

36:55.112 --> 36:57.046
Remember what I told you.

36:58.649 --> 37:01.413
Do anything you can
to keep Roger out on the lake.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.021
I'll need at least half an hour.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.255
Then I'll meet you back at the house.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.219
You've got me scared.

37:15.866 --> 37:17.356
Welcome to the club.

37:36.621 --> 37:37.610
Scoot over.

37:38.823 --> 37:40.450
I want to fish on this side.

37:44.729 --> 37:47.197
There's nothing like fresh salt air.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.927
And that's nothing like fresh salt air.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.334
- What is that smell anyway?
- Low tide.

37:54.972 --> 37:58.464
You can't even swim in here.
I don't know how the fish stay alive.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.373
Maybe they come from New York.

38:04.181 --> 38:05.478
Maybe they do.

38:18.095 --> 38:20.586
You're a pro at this. What do you say?

38:23.668 --> 38:26.535
I don't want to waste time
getting them on the hook.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.874
I can't.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.440
They're disgusting.

38:41.552 --> 38:44.612
I don't understand.
Don't you handle these all the time?

38:44.855 --> 38:46.152
I hate it.

38:48.492 --> 38:51.188
I'll do it. My goodness.

39:28.799 --> 39:32.257
- Are you all right?
- The little mother bit me. Jesus Christ!

39:32.603 --> 39:34.901
Are you sure it wasn't the hook?

39:35.406 --> 39:37.704
The thing bit right into my arm!

39:37.975 --> 39:41.103
They usually don't bite hard enough
to penetrate the skin.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.177
Let me see.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.314
- I never saw one bite like that.
- I did.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.218
When I was little...

39:54.525 --> 39:57.085
my daddy just started the worm farm...

39:58.162 --> 40:01.563
experimenting with ways
of getting them out of the ground.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.529
Tried electricity.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.634
Took my train transformer and hooked it up.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.967
Then he wet down the ground...

40:12.076 --> 40:15.239
sat back, and waited till it got dark.

40:16.347 --> 40:17.609
Did it work?

40:17.715 --> 40:19.706
Got 'em of the ground, all right...

40:20.451 --> 40:22.316
like roaches up a drainpipe.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.952
Had to pretty near cut off all of my thumb.

40:30.928 --> 40:34.364
- I never knew...
- It was no big deal.

40:37.201 --> 40:39.669
I want to go back to shore
to put something on this.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.398
- We'll all go.
- No, that's okay.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.200
You row me back.
I want to catch a nap, anyway...

40:45.476 --> 40:48.070
You and Roger
can catch some fish for dinner.

40:48.846 --> 40:51.644
It's okay. Roger will take care of you.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.174
- Won't you?
- Yeah.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.001
How about here?

41:55.412 --> 41:57.539
One spot's as good as another.

41:58.148 --> 42:00.776
- You want me to bait one up for you?
- Nope.

42:01.218 --> 42:05.279
- Two lines are better than one.
- I'm just as happy as a bump on a log.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.120
Here goes.

43:37.982 --> 43:39.142
Busted!

43:39.350 --> 43:41.375
That's very funny.

43:42.553 --> 43:44.748
What've you got there?

43:48.292 --> 43:50.954
- Who is it?
- That's what I want to find out.

43:51.161 --> 43:53.755
Did you get that out of Roger's truck?

43:54.331 --> 43:56.424
I don't think he'd dig that.

43:56.934 --> 43:59.528
- I'll put it back.
- Okay if I come, too?

44:01.772 --> 44:03.034
Sure, why not?

44:11.348 --> 44:14.112
- Maybe we ought to go for one more.
- I don't mind.

44:19.356 --> 44:22.917
It's nice, isn't it?
Just the two of us out here alone.

44:25.229 --> 44:27.561
He staying with you in the room tonight?

44:33.871 --> 44:35.930
You know better than listening to Alma.

44:42.813 --> 44:45.839
I wish we could've done this
before he come down here.

44:46.316 --> 44:47.806
I'm enjoying it, too.

44:49.553 --> 44:51.384
I've been thinking...

44:53.057 --> 44:54.854
With your daddy gone and all...

44:57.494 --> 45:00.258
I was thinking
you need some help with the business.

45:01.598 --> 45:03.088
Moving heavy furniture.

45:05.135 --> 45:06.227
I'm ready.

45:08.505 --> 45:11.702
I'm ready to tell Dad
I don't want to take over no worm farm.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.772
I got a surprise for you.

45:21.518 --> 45:23.986
Really? What is it?

45:25.255 --> 45:27.280
I told you, it's a surprise.

45:27.758 --> 45:29.157
What is it?

45:44.641 --> 45:45.835
It's him, isn't it?

45:45.943 --> 45:49.174
He come down here, busting his way in.
If he come near you again...

45:49.279 --> 45:52.112
I'm gonna bust his liver loose
if he tries to touch you.

46:45.402 --> 46:48.462
- What is it?
- Is Mick here?

46:48.972 --> 46:50.701
I thought he was with you.

46:50.808 --> 46:54.539
He cut his finger on a hook
and he had to get it fixed.

46:55.546 --> 46:57.013
What happened to you?

46:59.750 --> 47:02.742
I fell in the lake trying to pull in a fish.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.053
Is something wrong?

47:11.395 --> 47:13.363
Look at me. I'm a sight.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.426
Mick can't see me like this.
What am I gonna do?

47:19.002 --> 47:22.130
You march right upstairs
and wash off all that mud and filth.

47:22.906 --> 47:24.464
You smell awful.

47:25.042 --> 47:28.637
Lord knows what those tourists
are dumping in the water these days.

47:37.788 --> 47:38.982
I should have known.

47:39.590 --> 47:42.024
You can't drill teeth without electricity.

47:45.996 --> 47:49.625
Next time, I'm gonna wait for a storm
before I make an appointment.

47:54.338 --> 47:55.805
What are you doing?

48:04.448 --> 48:06.473
I really have to check this out.

48:07.351 --> 48:08.716
Far out.

48:10.153 --> 48:12.053
Just like in New York.

48:36.013 --> 48:37.844
This is really freaky.

48:38.782 --> 48:41.945
- May I ask what you're looking for?
- X-rays.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.948
There's three teeth missing
from the top of the skull.

48:58.268 --> 48:59.667
Hold this for a minute.

49:14.551 --> 49:16.109
I need more light.

49:20.257 --> 49:21.690
Bring it over here.

49:31.668 --> 49:33.329
Anybody I know?

49:35.405 --> 49:36.736
Aaron Beardsley.

49:40.877 --> 49:41.866
Come on.

50:27.524 --> 50:29.355
What's the matter? What happened?

50:49.046 --> 50:50.604
What is it? What happened?

50:51.948 --> 50:53.745
The worms attacked Roger.

50:57.521 --> 50:59.455
They crawled all over his face.

51:00.390 --> 51:02.756
And he ran off into the woods, screaming.

51:04.161 --> 51:05.560
I couldn't find him.

51:12.502 --> 51:14.697
I'm really glad you didn't chase after him.

51:16.039 --> 51:19.372
If Roger can see, he'll probably try
to make his way home, too.

51:25.248 --> 51:28.046
The worm farm
is much closer to the lagoon.

51:29.019 --> 51:32.011
Then we'll go to the worm farm,
and we'll look for him.

51:32.289 --> 51:33.256
All right?

51:33.824 --> 51:36.793
Ain't you gonna put
Mr. Beardsley's skull back in the truck...

51:36.893 --> 51:38.758
before Roger gets back?

51:46.837 --> 51:48.771
No! It can't be!

51:50.540 --> 51:53.634
You little brat! You don't even care.

51:53.877 --> 51:56.107
He was a beautiful old man.

51:56.213 --> 52:00.172
- Cut it out! Who said I didn't care?
- What is going on down here?

52:03.887 --> 52:07.152
- What were you two fighting about, anyway?
- Nothing.

52:10.527 --> 52:13.690
- Young lady...
- I told her it was her turn to make dinner.

52:21.505 --> 52:23.473
Since Geri has a guest...

52:25.108 --> 52:28.339
I think it would be a nice gesture
if you offered to make dinner...

52:28.445 --> 52:30.174
whether it's your turn or not.

52:33.583 --> 52:34.572
Settled.

52:37.988 --> 52:41.617
Did you remember to tell Alma
that you'd invited Roger for dinner?

52:44.161 --> 52:45.526
No, I forgot.

52:48.665 --> 52:50.826
Try to think of an extra side dish.

52:51.201 --> 52:56.104
Lord only knows when's the last time
we had two hungry men around here.

53:08.919 --> 53:10.978
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

53:13.290 --> 53:15.349
I'm really worried about Mama.

53:15.792 --> 53:17.760
I've never seen her this freaked out.

53:18.562 --> 53:21.224
You try and stay with her until we get back.

53:30.674 --> 53:33.165
I wonder what made
those worms act that way.

53:34.778 --> 53:38.214
You don't think Roger's old man
is fooling around with electricity?

53:38.315 --> 53:39.976
What electricity?

53:41.818 --> 53:43.115
Good point.

54:04.207 --> 54:06.641
I hope we find him before it gets dark.

54:08.178 --> 54:09.611
You wait in the car.

56:10.867 --> 56:13.028
- Did you see him?
- Get back in the car.

56:13.803 --> 56:16.328
- Give me the keys.
- I left them in the ignition.

56:26.182 --> 56:27.479
What did you see?

56:27.784 --> 56:30.412
Talk about New York.
Two corpses in one day.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.681
Next time you visit me, okay?

56:33.022 --> 56:34.751
- Roger?
- No.

56:38.061 --> 56:39.153
His father.

57:05.388 --> 57:07.151
Is Sheriff Reston around?

57:08.091 --> 57:09.490
He was.

57:09.592 --> 57:12.117
- Why, Geraldine!
- Hi, Mrs. Klopp.

57:12.228 --> 57:15.629
- Did your mother get the yarn I sent her?
- Yeah.

57:15.999 --> 57:18.297
She promised me she'd knit me a shawl.

57:18.501 --> 57:21.402
Not for me, but for my daughter.
It's a surprise...

57:21.504 --> 57:23.301
- Is he around?
- Who?

57:23.406 --> 57:25.704
- Sheriff Reston.
- No, he's not here.

57:25.842 --> 57:29.278
He might be having his dinner now.
I don't know what time it is.

57:29.379 --> 57:33.577
- All the clocks stopped.
- It's real important that we talk to him.

57:34.284 --> 57:37.378
- He might be over at the Casa Roma.
- Thank you.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.689
I've been thinking,
what with the roads to Statesboro closed...

57:40.790 --> 57:43.588
we'll have to find you
some accommodations for the evening.

57:46.396 --> 57:48.626
Excuse me, but this is real important.

57:48.731 --> 57:50.995
Sheriff, I know you think I'm a troublemaker.

57:51.100 --> 57:54.399
That's about the first thing
you've said that I can buy.

57:55.171 --> 57:57.139
I don't know how to go about this.

57:58.741 --> 58:01.676
But I think I have proof
that the skeleton we found...

58:01.778 --> 58:03.837
is the remains of Aaron Beardsley.

58:05.048 --> 58:06.538
What kind of proof?

58:11.054 --> 58:14.387
We found another body. It was Mr. Grimes.

58:14.824 --> 58:16.849
- Tell him about the worms.
- Worms?

58:18.428 --> 58:19.725
They bite.

58:23.299 --> 58:24.857
It's just horrible.

58:25.068 --> 58:27.559
They attacked Roger Grimes
when we were out fishing.

58:27.670 --> 58:30.298
He ran off into the woods,
and we can't find him.

58:31.241 --> 58:35.041
If you'll only come with us to the worm farm,
I can prove it to you.

58:35.378 --> 58:39.144
Listen, fella, there's a lot of spaghetti here.

58:41.150 --> 58:43.618
May take us 10, 15 minutes to finish it.

58:45.722 --> 58:48.247
That's a bigger head start than you deserve.

58:48.658 --> 58:50.353
Mr. Reston, you don't...

58:55.765 --> 58:56.993
Let's go.

58:59.702 --> 59:03.160
Remember, as I was saying,
what with the state roads closed...

59:07.143 --> 59:09.202
- Where are we going?
- Back to Beardsley's.

59:20.523 --> 59:23.083
What do you expect to find here?

59:35.238 --> 59:38.230
What was Beardsley doing in the shop
that late at night?

59:38.341 --> 59:42.141
He was probably working on
a piece of furniture and didn't want to stop.

59:59.162 --> 01:00:00.595
That's blood.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.824
What's in there?

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:08.734
- I think that's where he gets his well water.
- And candles?

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:11.539
I don't know.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.108
Come on.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:51.443
I think Roger and his father are off the hook,
as far as killing Beardsley is concerned.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:57.283
Roger must have followed us here,
spying on us all the time like a little kid.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:58.684
Then he saw the...

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.551
But why take the skeleton?

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:05.055
That was the surprise
he was telling me about on the boat.

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:08.186
- What?
- That thing would bring $100 in an auction.

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:11.164
He was talking about
going into the business.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:20.103
- Then who...
- The worms.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.778
Attacked?

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:34.681
Mick thinks that Mr. Beardsley
went to the shed to get candles...

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.281
when the lights went out.

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:40.057
He still had a matchbook in his hand
when we found him.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:42.458
Did you look in the shed?

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:44.356
No.

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:46.967
I'm glad we didn't.

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.489
Shouldn't you run next door
and ask about Roger?

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:17.428
I feel terrible starting without him.

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:23.565
He probably had to work late
at the worm farm.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:31.471
Willie just doesn't appreciate
how hard that poor boy works.

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.712
I don't understand that man.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.577
That's Roger's seat, dear.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.784
What's the difference?

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:49.363
I thought you'd want to sit next to Mick.

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:57.228
I guess it doesn't make any difference.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.470
Why isn't anybody eating?

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.384
Mama? Are you all right?

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:52.660
Where's Alma?

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:26.054
It's all right, Mama. Nobody's hurt.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.568
Come on.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.068
Could you come out here for a second?

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:47.382
Alma, I want you to stay with Mama, okay?

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:02.162
Listen to me for a minute.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.393
Is there some gasoline around?

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.202
In the shop.

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:14.070
Are you all right?

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:35.588
They're all gone.

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.334
Why is this happening?

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:53.414
I don't know.

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:58.285
Something is making the worms go crazy.

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:01.519
Just driving them
right up out of the ground.

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.228
Electricity!

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.561
- There isn't any.
- Yes, there is!

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:19.230
The power lines that fell down
are still sending juice into the ground.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:23.938
That's thousands of volts,
with soaking wet mud to act as a conductor.

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:29.607
And as soon as the light hits them,
they disappear.

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:44.329
I'm getting plywood to cover the doors,
so the worms can't get in here.

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:47.925
If I'm right, the only thing
holding them back is the light.

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.264
Where can I get some plywood?

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:53.809
- There's an old rice mill. It's all torn down.
- Where is it?

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:56.036
- I'll show you.
- No, you stay here.

01:06:56.278 --> 01:07:00.442
Your mother looks like she's about to crack.
I'll be back before it gets dark.

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:05.414
Stay in the house.
Don't tell your mother about what we saw.

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.489
Keep the candles burning.

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:09.248
Which way?

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:12.420
It's straight back about half a mile.

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:15.986
You come to this clearing
and then there's this concrete structure.

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:17.922
- You can't miss it.
- Okay.

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:20.562
How will you carry it?

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:23.528
I'll think of something.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.092
Where you going?

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:50.827
I'm just gonna take a shower
while there's still a little light.

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.033
Okay. Just don't go outside.

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:57.204
- What's outside?
- Do as I say.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.504
I hope you have better luck than I did.

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:06.208
There wasn't any water at all before.

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:08.292
You ain't got no good way to go, boy.

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:12.337
She's mine.

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.739
She always was mine.

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:21.315
Now you're coming down here
and you spoil everything.

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:27.146
You're gonna be spoiled.
You're gonna be the worm face.

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:22.236
Alma, did you hear a noise?

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.575
No, Mama.

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.414
Take some candles in to her.

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.367
Do you hear it?

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:51.400
Don't scare me.

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:56.669
Did you leave the water running
in the bathroom?

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:57.837
Yeah.

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:04.177
Water's coming out upstairs.

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.415
I can't wait to wash my face.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:10.217
Be careful, honey.

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.654
It's so dark up there.

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:13.771
How do you like the accommodations?

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.337
Just fine, honey.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.047
- Do you have room service?
- Sure do.

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:31.823
All the bread and water you can eat.

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:48.641
- What was that?
- Don't worry, I've got the key.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.523
Stop doing that.

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:11.062
Doing what?

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:17.763
That!

01:16:19.174 --> 01:16:21.108
I'm not doing anything.

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:44.690
- Come on, kids, it's closing time.
- Yeah.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.566
Did you hear something?

01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:52.896
I don't know.
Wait a minute. Hand me that candle.

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.846
Where's Alma?

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:12.850
Upstairs.

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:20.862
Is the front door closed?

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:26.861
But I left the back door open.
To try to get some fresh air.

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.701
Wish there was a little breeze.

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:41.047
There. It's almost finished.

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:44.281
I know Mrs. Klopp would like it for herself...

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:47.247
if only she wasn't allergic to wool.
Poor thing.

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:56.624
Anybody there?

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.074
Mrs. Sanders...

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.486
is that you?

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.055
Oh, no!

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.707
It's all right. Come on, I'll help you down.

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:47.378
Okay, another one, come on, one more.
There you go.

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:51.375
It's all right.

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:54.454
Let me get this off you.

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:01.859
It's gonna be okay.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:06.324
Are you all right?

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:13.197
Come on. Come with me.

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:27.248
How are you at climbing trees?

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:32.023
Wait. Where's my mama and Alma?

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:35.956
You can't go down there.
The worms are halfway up the stairs.

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:38.157
- We have to get out of here.
- No!

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:41.358
- I have to help them!
- It's too late!

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:43.436
They're dead!

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.337
Come on.

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:32.920
No!

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:11.849
Hey! Excuse me.

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:17.089
I thought you lovebirds might want to know
the power's on.

01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:19.819
Tower's repaired, everything's good as new.

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:23.430
Which direction is the nearest town?

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:31.362

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:42.042

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:03.920
