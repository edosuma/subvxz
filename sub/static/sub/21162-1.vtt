00:42.709 --> 00:46.111
Man:

Man: Here we go.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.482

01:25.852 --> 01:28.487
Everybody come on in.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.390
Everybody get in here.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.158
Let's go.
Let's get your picture.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.363
Come on, here we go.
Let's go.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.532
-Everybody say cheese.
-Smile.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.701
Together: Cheese!

02:22.909 --> 02:25.144
Hey.

02:25.146 --> 02:28.147
Where do you go
when I'm not with you?

02:32.185 --> 02:34.520
That other world.

02:34.522 --> 02:38.290
Right.
Your little escape.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.867
Okay.

02:50.803 --> 02:52.437
Ow!

03:15.628 --> 03:17.863
Maggie!

03:19.599 --> 03:21.667
Let's go!

03:34.215 --> 03:35.747
Oh, my god.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.534
--Maggie!

03:55.536 --> 03:59.004
-Yeah!
-Let's go!

04:00.573 --> 04:02.441
Coming!

04:17.957 --> 04:20.859
Your card.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.463
Whose quote is this?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.031
I'm good.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.303
What?

04:35.442 --> 04:38.343
Let's just go get
the bad guys.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.483
What?

04:45.752 --> 04:47.619
I'm hungry.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.855
Me too.

04:49.857 --> 04:55.360
Hey, let's just go to the
airport and fly away somewhere.

04:55.362 --> 04:58.664
There's no shame
in stepping back for a minute.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.833
Not yet.
Just have to connect the dots.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.069
I know, but when you step back,
you see them better.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.573
It's Marty.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.677
911 just called homicide.
I'm patching you in.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.912
Ma'am, repeat that, please.

05:15.649 --> 05:20.552
Some guy keeps calling me --
calling me diedre Doyle.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.753
He's using your sister's
name, Doyle.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.088
You two want
to check that out?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.823
All right, have
the uniforms standing by

05:24.825 --> 05:25.824
until you hear from us.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.092
Woman:
Please hurry!

05:27.094 --> 05:28.560
I'm scared.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.330
Okay, ma'am, this is
detective Maggie wynn.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.565
The call's coming from
the hambly gallery

05:33.567 --> 05:35.534
at 14 hampden street
and southie.

05:38.072 --> 05:39.905
He says he wants a date.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.740
I mean, diedre Doyle,

05:41.742 --> 05:44.543
isn't that the teacher
that just got killed?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.511
We're on our way.
Stay calm.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.381
Ma'am, are you sure the caller
said diedre Doyle?

05:49.383 --> 05:51.383
-Please hurry.
-Stay calm.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.018
Is there a room
you can go to,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.020
a safe place, a bathroom,
a closet?

05:55.022 --> 05:57.522
Is there anything else you can
tell us about the caller?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.458
Did he have a distinctive voice,
an accent?

06:01.729 --> 06:03.729
We're approaching the building
now, ma'am.

06:03.731 --> 06:04.863
-Almost there.
-We're right at the...

06:12.772 --> 06:15.140
Woman: Help!

06:15.142 --> 06:18.477
Somebody help me!

06:18.479 --> 06:21.046
Please help me!

06:44.905 --> 06:48.807
Ma'am, it's all right.
It's all right, ma'am!

06:48.809 --> 06:50.909
We're the police.
It's all right.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.911
No, please, no.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.747
We're the police.
Everything's gonna be fine.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.849
Go!

06:57.851 --> 06:59.551
Go, I got this.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.119
It's all right. It's okay.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.688
It's okay.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.425
You'll be fine.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.126
You're okay.
We're here now.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.127
Everything is fine.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.797
Thank you...So much!

07:16.637 --> 07:19.037
Maggie! It's a trap!

07:21.707 --> 07:23.175
Maggie.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.129
Yeah.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.164
Whoa!

08:19.166 --> 08:21.132
Whew.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.634
Nice catch.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.270
Yeah, I played
a little soccer.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.740
Are you in love
with her, too, darling?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.075
With our island?

08:30.077 --> 08:32.010
I don't really know her.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.980
Can you see how she opens
her arms to us?

08:34.982 --> 08:38.149
She's waiting for us.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.085
On that roof,
that widow's walk,

08:40.087 --> 08:42.754
that's where all
the women waited

08:42.756 --> 08:44.723
for their men to sail home.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.225
Is there someone
waiting for you?

08:47.227 --> 08:50.729
No.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.164
That's not true.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.700
The grey lady is.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.969
That's what we call her.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.941
This is for an opening
at an art gallery.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.776
Please come.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.649
You too, darlings.
Tell your friends.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.817
-Thank you.
-Thank you, duchess.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.853
Man: Okay, yeah, sure.
Thanks.

09:26.933 --> 09:30.068
How you doing, man?
My name's Johnson.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.137
How'd you know I was coming?

09:32.139 --> 09:34.005
Your commissioner
called my chief.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.574
Can I?

09:39.145 --> 09:42.080
So, Jim.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.150
Sorry --
can I call you James?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.851
People call me Doyle.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.921
Why? Were you ex-military?
I'm marines.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.691
I just don't like
my first name.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.126
Well, neither do I.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.962
It's Julian.

10:00.366 --> 10:03.068
So, where you staying?

10:03.070 --> 10:06.271
Come on, tell me.
I'll show you the way.

10:10.009 --> 10:12.277
So, my commissioner
called, huh?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.645
Yeah.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.313
Got a problem with that?

10:15.315 --> 10:16.915
Nope.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.217
So, this is
the weather here?

10:19.219 --> 10:21.786
Fog one minute,
rain the next?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.956
Oh, yeah.
It's the grey lady.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.958
You know, she's, uh,

10:26.960 --> 10:28.760
she's a woman,
so she changes her mind.

10:30.631 --> 10:35.400
And over here on your right is
the safe harbor guest house.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.341
This looks like
a working vacation.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.677
You must be a detective.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.879
Doyle.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.914
Station's right in town.

10:49.916 --> 10:53.685
Why don't you stop by,
have a coffee?

10:53.687 --> 10:54.819
Chief's waiting
to meet you.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.655
I'll walk back.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.657
Miss cash will help you
get settled.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.261
Room's at the top
on your right.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.929
Boxes you sent are in there.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.165
Toilet's broken.
Use the bath down the hall.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.235
If you come in late, tiptoe.
Other guests might arrive.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.737
Cold breakfast and hot coffee
available all day.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.839
Help yourself.
-Mr. Doyle.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.042
I'll get your bags
if you smile.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.378
Come on,
you're on nantucket.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.547
Johnson: Doyle?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.118
Doyle, it's me, Johnson.
The chief wants to see you.

13:43.189 --> 13:46.124
I did<i> not</i> see that gun.

13:47.426 --> 13:50.962
Come on.
I'll wait for you in the car.

14:01.941 --> 14:04.542
Right up there is the bank,
the drugstore.

14:04.544 --> 14:08.313
Those roads up there take you
to other parts of the island.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.982
There's a catholic church,
post office,

14:10.984 --> 14:13.952
and down there's
a movie theater.

14:13.954 --> 14:17.856
And<i> this</i>
is chief Maguire.

14:19.558 --> 14:23.361
Chris Maguire.
How you doing?

14:23.363 --> 14:26.130
Well, I wanted you to see
the heart of the island,

14:26.132 --> 14:28.099
and this is it.
Main and federal.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.869
You got people from all over
the world coming here.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.204
All colors and creeds,
and peacefully.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.275
We want to
keep it that way.

14:37.277 --> 14:42.046
Sorry about your partner
and your sister.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.283
You lose people like that,
you lose...

14:45.285 --> 14:47.185
Pieces of yourself.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.655
There's a lot of good people
on this rock.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.457
They'll help you heal.

14:56.295 --> 14:59.430
When we were in the military,
we saw...

14:59.432 --> 15:02.233
A lot of
dark human behavior.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.973
Come back here,
and it was good.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.316
Woman:
Commissioner daley's office.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.651
This is Doyle returning
for the commissioner.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.420
Man: What are you doing
on nantucket?

17:02.422 --> 17:04.355
Same thing you should be doing
in Boston --

17:04.357 --> 17:05.623
trying to find the guy.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.358
You're in direct violation
of my order.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.160
You don't find him,
i will.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.628
I'm pulling your badge
and suspending your pay.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.130
You know I don't care
about that stuff.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.264
Find him.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.510
Woman: 911.
What's your emergency?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.078
Hey, what's up?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.080
Marty, they locked me
out of the database.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.715
You said they wouldn't.
-They<i> had</i> to.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.550
I want you to run
two names for me.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.218
Dolores Doyle,
known as Lola,

17:34.220 --> 17:36.054
and Elizabeth Doyle,
known as Beth.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.456
-I can't do that, pal.
-Why not?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.458
Because you're off the case
and I'm in charge.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.692
Listen to me, Doyle,

17:41.694 --> 17:43.194
I don't want you doing
anything stupid.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.395
You're balls deep
in this.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.531
Well, I'm not gonna stop,
brother.

17:49.102 --> 17:53.604
The rose & crown. She'll open
back up in a couple days.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.674
Detective Johnson...
Is expecting me.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.477
Go on in.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.085
Johnson.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.460
Oh, mikki.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.527
How are you?

18:16.529 --> 18:18.429
Very good.
Where are ya?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.798
Nantucket,
chasing down a lead.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.333
Listen, mikki,

18:22.335 --> 18:24.602
I found uncle Tim's
old homicide report

18:24.604 --> 18:26.704
in the Boston archives.
-Yeah, so?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.873
-He never found who did it.
-Oh, it's no big mystery.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.241
It was the mob.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.110
You know they questioned
my father?

18:32.112 --> 18:33.311
Yeah, so was I.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.679
So was everybody
in the neighborhood.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.247
Big deal.
Case closed.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.116
Do you know what happened
to Lola?
No.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.550
She fell off the map.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.719
Mikki, does rose & crown mean
anything to you?

18:41.721 --> 18:44.188
Jimmy, why are you poking
around in this?

18:44.190 --> 18:45.523
Does this have to do
with your sister?

18:45.525 --> 18:47.125
Maybe.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.360
You think Lola might've come
back to the island?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.661
She may know something.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.396
Jimmy --
mikki, I got to go.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.465
Please let me know if you hear
anything about Lola.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.437
What's Lola's last name?

18:59.439 --> 19:00.471
Doyle.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.874
Doyle is d-o-y-l --
y-l-e.

19:02.876 --> 19:05.510
Yes, I know how to spell
your last name.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.745
I think that's because
I'm Irish.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.450
Can I see that picture?
Yeah.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.286
This is her in 1984,
that's my father,

19:15.288 --> 19:17.255
his brother, me, sister,
my cousin.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.856
That's brant point, right?

19:18.858 --> 19:20.658
Yeah, he was stationed
out there, coast guard.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.328
Lola's my aunt,
so do me a favor.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.165
Check if there are any other
doyles living out here.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.332
Cousin's name is Beth.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.168
Beth.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.538
All right,
that's in the works.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.342
Is that your father?

19:38.344 --> 19:41.345
Uncle.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.714
Lola's husband.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.551
So, it was a mob hit.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.759
Come on, man.
You're coming with me.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.727
Where are we going?
It's Friday.

19:56.729 --> 20:00.965
We're gonna hear some music
and have a drink.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.466
Or three.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.302
You play guitar?

20:04.304 --> 20:08.306
No. That's why you'll need
the drink.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.888
-Jimmy.
-Mikki.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.791
-What now, Jimmy?
-One more question.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.793
Let's say the mob
didn't do it.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.895
Any chance Lola was so pissed
at my father,

20:30.897 --> 20:32.663
she's sending people
to hurt me?

20:32.665 --> 20:35.333
You're more wounded
than I thought you were.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.901
Keep your eyes open.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.603
Say your prayers.

20:41.707 --> 20:45.443
- You okay?
- -No.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.711
I could really
use some help.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.346
Of course, yeah.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.547
Excellent, thank you.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.382
-The chicken?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.517
-Didn't make enough chicken?
-I don't know, I hope I did.

20:53.519 --> 20:54.919
A lot of people here.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.651
I, uh...

22:33.653 --> 22:34.919
Thank you, lords and ladies.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.620
I just got this.

22:36.622 --> 22:39.090
Your aunt Lola was here
about a year ago.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.825
We have dui fingerprints

22:40.827 --> 22:43.794
that match a marriage license
she got here in 1982.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.830
But, uh, there's no record
of her living here now.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.798
Any other doyles?
No.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.567
We sent the picture off
to my people on the cape.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.835
They're gonna
digitally age her.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.403
Man: What do you think
you're doing?

22:52.405 --> 22:55.106
Get your hands off my wife!
-Ex-wife, pal.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.475
-And you!
-What are you --

22:57.477 --> 22:59.577
you're an embarrassment.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.379
Nice to see you again.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.646
Is the grey lady
treating you well?

23:02.648 --> 23:04.782
- Not bad.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.651
You look, my son,
dismayed.

23:07.653 --> 23:10.755
These our actors
are all but spirits

23:10.757 --> 23:13.124
and are melting into air,

23:13.126 --> 23:15.693
to leave not
a rack behind.

23:17.697 --> 23:18.963
Be cheerful, sir.

23:18.965 --> 23:22.433
We are such stuff
as dreams are made of.

23:22.435 --> 23:27.671
And our little lives
are rounded with a sleep.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.041
Good night, duchess.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.914
Not a duchess for long,
I'm afraid, darling.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.550
What did that mean?

23:39.552 --> 23:41.152
Her husband --

23:41.154 --> 23:42.820
2x4 in the suit
over there --

23:42.822 --> 23:44.822
is divorcing her.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.191
I'm gonna jump in
on this tune.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.893
You hungry?
Ribs are great.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.761
I got to make
a phone call.

23:53.031 --> 23:54.632
Marty, don't be a prick.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.201
I need you to check on
those two names for me --

23:57.203 --> 23:58.769
Lola and Elizabeth Doyle.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.771
Call me back.
I need your help.

24:02.074 --> 24:05.042
Hello.
Want to play?

24:05.044 --> 24:08.112
No. Thank you.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.780
Okay.

24:09.782 --> 24:10.748
We rode over on the boat
together.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.149
Oh, yeah, right.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.185
You were talking to that woman,
the art lady.

24:14.187 --> 24:15.853
You were drinking
a bottle of...

24:15.855 --> 24:17.922
Prosecco.
You dropped it.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.190
It didn't break.

24:19.192 --> 24:21.225
Your friend has fast feet.

24:21.227 --> 24:24.128
God, I love it here.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.731
So beautiful everywhere
you look.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.734
Oh, my phone.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.236
Go play, honey.
Go.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.807
Now my impatient brother's
wondering where I am.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.977
They're all yours, Anita!

24:39.979 --> 24:41.712
Oh, thanks a lot.

24:41.714 --> 24:42.913
See ya.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.049
-All right.
-Diedre.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.257
-Down!
-Doyle!

24:55.027 --> 24:56.961
Doyle, we got a 911.
We got to go.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.530
Come on, saddle up!

25:06.004 --> 25:08.606
That's the car
from the party.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.641
The duchess' car.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.576
Yeah.

25:12.578 --> 25:15.045
This is her road.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.657
She have a pulse?

25:26.659 --> 25:28.959
No.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.964
I'm gonna back this car up.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.651
This is Johnson.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.287
We have an unattended death
at creek road.

25:56.289 --> 25:57.855
EMT has already arrived,

25:57.857 --> 26:00.257
but stand by for possible
full team response.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.892
Over.
-Copy that.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.578
No, please, no.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.746
No.

27:28.113 --> 27:30.180
A rose...

27:30.182 --> 27:32.416
And crown.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.318
The rose...

27:34.320 --> 27:37.287
And crown.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.337
Doyle.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.673
Something
crossed your face just then.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.675
What is it?

27:57.677 --> 27:59.343
We need to talk.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.448
I don't think it was
an accident.

28:04.450 --> 28:08.185
That wound, similar to the cuts
on the two Boston victims.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.887
I never read about
any cuts.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.855
We didn't release
that information.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.725
My Boston guy's here.

28:14.727 --> 28:18.762
My partner's back,
my sister's back.

28:18.764 --> 28:22.733
Ladies and gentlemen

28:22.735 --> 28:24.268
the duchess' back.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.304
-Hey, what's up?
-How's everybody doing?

28:27.306 --> 28:29.840
Hey, good to see you.
Good to see you.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.243
What's going on?

28:33.245 --> 28:35.312
Johnson: Doyle, listen.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.115
We've only had three murders
in 25 years here.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.217
Chief has just declared
this one an accident.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.786
He's not gonna want to tell
the people of this island

28:42.788 --> 28:44.121
there's a murderer
on the loose,

28:44.123 --> 28:46.990
especially when maybe
there's not.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.359
Johnson,
these wounds are linked.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.095
I need to find my aunt.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.965
I'll help you.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.200
Here.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.468
It's a list
of all the people

28:57.470 --> 28:59.136
that were invited
to the barn party.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.206
Cops arrest people,
people get angry.

29:02.208 --> 29:05.075
There must be 1,000 people out
there who want to kill you.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.810
What's your question?

29:06.812 --> 29:08.746
Why don't they?

29:08.748 --> 29:11.882
Why would they kill someone
you barely knew,

29:11.884 --> 29:13.150
like the duchess?

29:13.152 --> 29:15.853
Let's find out.

29:15.855 --> 29:19.356
Doyle: Detective Johnson said
you'd be good to talk to.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.492
I'm trying to find a woman
named Lola Doyle.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.961
I'm not finding anybody
by that name in our records.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.395
I'm sorry.

29:25.397 --> 29:28.332
The rose & crown.
Where does that name come from?

29:28.334 --> 29:30.834
I don't know.
It's some old English thing.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.503
It's --

29:32.505 --> 29:34.271
excuse me.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.006
This wouldn't have happened
if you called me earlier.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.509
Is it true our guy
followed you over there?

29:38.511 --> 29:40.978
You find anything out
about my aunt?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.913
Listen to me,
you persistent prick,

29:42.915 --> 29:44.515
we<i> never</i> had
this conversation.

29:44.517 --> 29:48.018
She left Boston in the mid-'80s,
never remarried,

29:48.020 --> 29:50.854
ran a truck stop motel
in trappe, Pennsylvania.

29:50.856 --> 29:53.824
We lose her trail
two years ago.

29:53.826 --> 29:56.827
What about my cousin Beth?

29:56.829 --> 29:59.363
Well, we got her in foster homes
in the '80s.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.999
Psychological counseling,
juvie court docs.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.401
Nothing on her after age 14
when she was committed

30:04.403 --> 30:07.004
to the Massachusetts psychiatric
treatment center.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.806
Hold on.
Excuse me.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.842
-Yeah.
-Do you know this man?

30:11.844 --> 30:14.444
Yeah. Tony ramos.
He used to cook for us.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.979
You know where he lives?

30:19.884 --> 30:21.919
Over on Alan's way.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.020
Thank you.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.188
Got to go.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.422
Whoa, Doyle, wait.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.224
Doyle, what aren't you
telling me here?

30:38.503 --> 30:40.003
Can I help you?

30:40.005 --> 30:41.438
Is Tony here?

30:43.241 --> 30:46.343
I'm Tony.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.913
I'm looking for a woman
i thought you might know

30:49.915 --> 30:51.949
from the rose & crown.
Her name's Lola.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.484
I saw you with Johnson.
You a cop?

30:54.486 --> 30:55.953
Yeah.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.591
Let's check inside.

31:06.866 --> 31:10.100
Well, look at it!

31:10.102 --> 31:12.402
-Put it in, baby.
-Hey, hey, listen up.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.137
Listen up.
This gentleman's a cop.

31:14.139 --> 31:16.006
He's looking for someone
named, uh, Lola.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.243
Doyle.
Lola Doyle.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.247
Somebody named Lola.

31:23.249 --> 31:26.216
Going once, going twice...
-No.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.252
...three times.

31:29.621 --> 31:32.289
This lady I don't know.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.225
That's me in the middle.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.960
Yeah, I knew Lola.

31:36.962 --> 31:38.462
She's dead.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.529
You sure?

31:39.531 --> 31:41.231
I'm sure as shit.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.934
I went to her funeral.
-When?

31:43.936 --> 31:45.936
I don't know,
last Christmas.

31:45.938 --> 31:48.071
She<i> hated</i> Christmas.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.507
It's kind of ironic 'cause
she loved the north pole.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.911
I'll say.

31:53.913 --> 31:56.179
She was my aunt.

31:58.016 --> 32:00.651
She had a daughter.
Her daughter ever show up here?

32:00.653 --> 32:02.286
Not that I know of.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.187
She leave anything behind,
any belongings,

32:04.189 --> 32:05.689
anything I can
take a look at?

32:05.691 --> 32:08.458
I didn't know her that well.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.661
Hey, deal me out!
I gotta pee!

32:12.363 --> 32:15.098
Your lady friend there.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.135
What's her name?
Angela.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.304
Tell Angela I'd like to visit
my aunt's grave.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.472
Ask her to call me and let me
know where it is.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.607
Okay.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.078
Deal me in.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.288
-Johnson.
-Hey, man.

32:38.290 --> 32:42.225
Do me a favor and check the town
death records for a Lola Doyle.

32:46.130 --> 32:50.434
And anything you got on...
Angela Franco.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.214
I'm sorry!

33:37.216 --> 33:38.782
Lola, look at me.
Look at me, Lola.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.617
All right,
now get inside.

34:33.671 --> 34:36.239
Billy macleod.

35:24.822 --> 35:27.357
It's a boarding house.

35:43.876 --> 35:45.542
-Come on.
-Stop!

35:45.544 --> 35:47.744
Stop it. No.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.179
Nobody will see them.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.247
Yeah, I've heard that
before.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.281
Not from me.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.549
Mm-hmm.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.421
Excuse me.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.323
I'd like to buy
that painting.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.425
Okay, good.

36:02.427 --> 36:04.161
Excuse me.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.595
Uh, would you like
to meet the artist?

36:05.597 --> 36:07.898
Yeah, is he here?

36:07.900 --> 36:09.633
Melissa?

36:09.635 --> 36:12.235
This is the artist.

36:12.237 --> 36:13.870
Melissa Reynolds.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.772
This gentleman just bought
"the lady in the bath."

36:15.774 --> 36:18.708
Oh. That's great.
Thank you.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.677
It's one of my favorites.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.514
I'm sorry.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.683
I thought this was an opening
for Billy macleod.

36:26.685 --> 36:30.954
It is. That's me.
I'm Billy.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.190
I'm a sculptor.
You saw my work coming in.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.692
But it's also
a group show.

36:35.694 --> 36:39.262
Anyway,
i like your painting.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.598
Hey, listen, we're gonna go
celebrate after this.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.832
You should come with us.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.801
I can afford dinner now,
thanks to you.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.703
Take credit?

36:46.705 --> 36:47.971
Oh, we do.

36:49.473 --> 36:52.309
Oh! Oh, my god!

36:52.311 --> 36:54.377
Oh, my god,
i am so, so sorry.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.680
Oh, my god, whose is this?

36:56.682 --> 36:59.216
It's mine, and it's $5,000.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.985
No, she's messing with you.
Come here.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.287
This is Clara.
She's my friend.

37:04.289 --> 37:05.956
She's the artist.
-Please, you have to let me --

37:05.958 --> 37:07.624
don't worry, don't worry.
It was an accident.

37:07.626 --> 37:08.758
Don't worry,
but thank you.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.926
I feel terrible.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.761
It's ruined.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.263
I'll tell you what.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.664
We're going for a couple
of drinks afterwards.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.865
How about you buy me
a couple of pints

37:15.867 --> 37:17.734
and we're all set, okay?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.769
Yeah, we're going over to crew
at the end of straight wharf.

37:19.771 --> 37:22.339
Come on.
Join us.

37:30.448 --> 37:31.481
Thank you.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.583
You're welcome.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.786
I never bought
a painting before.

37:36.788 --> 37:37.954
What was it about mine?

37:37.956 --> 37:40.824
I liked it.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.426
-Can I...?
-Sure.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.861
Don't drop it.

37:44.863 --> 37:48.331
I never make
the same mistake twice.

37:54.538 --> 37:56.906
So, you got a girlfriend?

37:56.908 --> 37:58.408
No.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.010
I did.

38:00.012 --> 38:02.646
She, uh...

38:02.648 --> 38:05.382
Passed away.

38:06.851 --> 38:09.519
So, i-i guess I still do.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.821
Yeah.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.657
I understand that.

38:13.659 --> 38:16.826
It's hard to know what your life
would've been

38:16.828 --> 38:18.495
if somebody had lived.

38:18.497 --> 38:20.864
So, you just make it up,

38:20.866 --> 38:22.866
and it's perfect.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.335
But no one can compete
with that

38:25.337 --> 38:28.672
because it's impossible to find
somebody that good.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.573
So you just end up alone.

38:35.446 --> 38:38.348
You speak from experience?

38:38.350 --> 38:40.583
I am well traveled.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.819
How about you?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.854
Grew up in Boston,

38:44.856 --> 38:47.424
bounced around with my mother's
family various places --

38:47.426 --> 38:49.426
Ireland.
Mm.

38:49.428 --> 38:52.395
And then moved back,
joined the police force.

38:52.397 --> 38:54.898
I'm well traveled
for a cop.

38:54.900 --> 39:00.603
You know, they say the real
journey lies within.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.605
Hard for cops
to be spiritual.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.074
Really?

39:04.076 --> 39:05.942
I would think
that's the only way

39:05.944 --> 39:07.744
you could make sense,
though.

39:13.451 --> 39:15.985
This is so disgusting.

39:19.890 --> 39:21.691
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

39:23.394 --> 39:25.095
Tastes pretty good to<i> me.</i>

39:25.097 --> 39:26.763
Absolutely.

39:30.801 --> 39:32.702
Eli. Eli!

39:32.704 --> 39:34.738
Eli, wait!

39:39.411 --> 39:40.810
Wait!

40:15.880 --> 40:18.148
Eli.

40:18.150 --> 40:20.784
This is not
who you can be right now.

40:20.786 --> 40:24.020
Hey.
Beth can't help us, okay?

40:24.022 --> 40:27.490
Beth can't help us.

40:27.492 --> 40:29.526
We need Eli.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.027
Let me see.

40:37.134 --> 40:39.002
I love you.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.472
So, if I ask you to do something
like tonight,

40:42.474 --> 40:44.140
it's not because
I'm not listening.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.076
It's because
it's important.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.178
Hey.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.647
No.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.116
Come on.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.599
Hurry, it's cold.

41:09.601 --> 41:14.237
I know that tonight was hard,
but you did good.

41:14.239 --> 41:17.740
Who was that woman
that he was talking to?

41:17.742 --> 41:20.543
Melissa.

41:20.545 --> 41:24.247
She has lots of friends,
and they could be useful.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.983
Friendly fire,
just like the duchess.

41:40.030 --> 41:43.800
We plan and we execute,

41:43.802 --> 41:47.103
and we remember
the divine example.

41:47.105 --> 41:52.609
One day our lord returned home,
he found his mother crying.

41:52.611 --> 41:55.612
His father
had been murdered.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.981
His thirst for revenge
was unquenchable.

41:57.983 --> 41:59.883
Revenge is good.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.552
Five-fold revenge
is better.

42:02.554 --> 42:05.622
But what about Lola?
She ruins everything.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.824
We'll find her first.
He'll lead us to her.

42:07.826 --> 42:10.126
But the order
has to be followed.

42:10.128 --> 42:14.163
God's chosen order will be.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.698
He gave us this mission,

42:15.700 --> 42:17.967
and we have the will
to carry it out.

42:19.937 --> 42:22.805
See?

42:22.807 --> 42:27.010
First his blood,
then his love.

42:27.012 --> 42:29.145
And then the friendly fire.

42:34.852 --> 42:37.053
How do you feel?

42:37.055 --> 42:38.821
Better.

42:38.823 --> 42:41.658
What's your name?

42:41.660 --> 42:43.226
I'm Eli.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.662
And who is Eli?

42:47.598 --> 42:51.234
I am the lord parashurama.

42:51.236 --> 42:54.571
I am am the god of revenge.

42:58.075 --> 43:00.343
Doyle: Billy, thanks
for talking to me.

43:00.345 --> 43:03.346
No, no.
Thanks for talking to me.

43:03.348 --> 43:06.916
Melissa said you were there
when they found the duchess.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.785
How long
you know Melissa?

43:08.787 --> 43:11.754
Uh, I've known Melissa about
eight years, I think.

43:11.756 --> 43:14.991
We went out a few times,
but I'm not her type.

43:14.993 --> 43:16.192
She's very spiritual.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.861
Beautiful, really.
I'm not.

43:18.863 --> 43:20.597
What about Clara?

43:20.599 --> 43:23.800
Clara? I love Clara.
Look at her.

43:23.802 --> 43:25.768
Apparently I'm not
her type, either.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.738
Why won't she look at me?

43:28.740 --> 43:30.340
Oh, man,
she -- she can't see.

43:30.342 --> 43:32.308
She's legally blind.

43:32.310 --> 43:34.677
At this rate, I'm gonna have
dinner for us in a few minutes.

43:34.679 --> 43:36.312
Happy hunting.

43:36.314 --> 43:37.847
Thank you.

43:45.255 --> 43:47.357
And the duchess?

43:47.359 --> 43:49.659
How'd you meet her?

43:49.661 --> 43:51.060
I cook for her.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.795
Did a couple of dinner parties
at her house.

43:52.797 --> 43:55.031
Yeah, the duchess treehouse.

43:55.033 --> 43:57.367
Her husband's<i> the</i> financial whiz
out of Chicago.

43:59.137 --> 44:02.905
She collected art, so I invited
her to the gallery.

44:02.907 --> 44:04.841
Johnson.

44:04.843 --> 44:07.143
Johnson: There's no death record
for your aunt on nantucket.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.412
All right, then please check
on the name Angela Franco

44:09.414 --> 44:10.947
and find out
where she lives.

44:10.949 --> 44:12.115
All right.

44:12.117 --> 44:14.017
Roger that.
-Great.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.694
--Melissa?

44:24.696 --> 44:26.429
Whoa, hey!

44:26.431 --> 44:27.864
Billy:
No, no, it's okay.

44:27.866 --> 44:29.265
Probably just
her panic thing.

44:29.267 --> 44:31.834
-You okay?
-I got panicky.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.237
Melissa,
take a deep breath.

44:34.239 --> 44:35.672
It's okay.
-I'm fine.

44:35.674 --> 44:37.907
It's just -- it's okay.

44:37.909 --> 44:39.876
Um...

44:39.878 --> 44:42.945
I thought...

44:42.947 --> 44:44.380
Remember when I found that --
that woman under the ice?

44:44.382 --> 44:46.049
Uh-huh.

44:46.051 --> 44:47.950
I thought I saw --
i thought I saw her hand.

44:47.952 --> 44:50.353
It's probably just a broken oar.

44:50.355 --> 44:51.788
Of course it was.

44:52.791 --> 44:53.990
Breathe.

44:53.992 --> 44:55.024
It wasn't a hand.

44:55.026 --> 44:56.726
Sorry.

44:56.728 --> 44:58.127
I'm -- I'm crazy.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.462
Billy: I think we have enough
scallops for dinner.

44:59.464 --> 45:00.897
Why don't we
get out of here?

45:00.899 --> 45:01.931
Shall we?

45:01.933 --> 45:04.033
Oh, god.

45:07.337 --> 45:11.240
Bye.
See you at dinner.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.076
You too, Doyle.
5:00.

45:13.078 --> 45:14.343
Don't forget.
-Bye.

45:14.345 --> 45:15.878
All right, see ya.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.047
My friend ginger lets me
paint here.

45:18.049 --> 45:20.183
Come on, let's get warm.

45:24.288 --> 45:26.956
Here you go.

45:26.958 --> 45:28.825
Nantucket Pearl.
Cheers.

45:28.827 --> 45:29.959
Cheers.

45:32.362 --> 45:34.464
I'm gonna get dressed.

45:34.466 --> 45:37.400
Feel free to look around.
There's some tea.

45:37.402 --> 45:38.901
And help yourself.

45:43.273 --> 45:45.441
Doyle: So, how'd you get
to the island?

45:45.443 --> 45:49.412
I, uh, I sailed in
with a boyfriend.

45:49.414 --> 45:54.250
Jumped ship, met Clara,
and I just started hanging out.

45:54.252 --> 45:58.955
You know, paint houses
and making art.

45:58.957 --> 46:00.923
Anyway, after a while,

46:00.925 --> 46:04.827
we opened up the x gallery
with Robert and Billy and kasha

46:04.829 --> 46:07.330
and Sanchez and a whole bunch
of other friends

46:07.332 --> 46:10.900
who just didn't really fit into
the whole commercial art scene.

46:10.902 --> 46:13.336
What kind of tea
do you want?

46:13.338 --> 46:16.806
Um, I don't know,
surprise me.

46:16.808 --> 46:19.208
How about you?
What brought you here?

46:19.210 --> 46:23.112
Came once with my father and
my sister when I was a kid.

46:24.916 --> 46:27.784
My aunt and uncle
used to live here.

46:27.786 --> 46:30.119
So, I'm trying to find her.

46:31.421 --> 46:32.922
Here's your tea.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.290
I'm, uh -- I'm changing.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.958
I won't look.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.027
I've heard that one before.

46:38.029 --> 46:40.363
Not from me.

46:47.304 --> 46:48.871
So...

46:48.873 --> 46:50.907
Let me ask you something.

46:53.443 --> 46:55.178
Are cops
afraid of anything?

46:55.180 --> 46:56.479
Sure.

46:56.481 --> 46:59.015
This about that panic thing
out there?

46:59.017 --> 47:00.983
Yeah.

47:00.985 --> 47:03.252
How long you had that?

47:03.254 --> 47:07.190
Uh...Couple years.
Since my mom died.

47:08.859 --> 47:11.093
What's it like?

47:20.838 --> 47:25.341
You think
you're gonna die...

47:25.343 --> 47:28.010
And then you don't.

47:30.113 --> 47:31.914
What triggers it?

47:31.916 --> 47:33.850
Fear.

47:33.852 --> 47:35.885
They tell us in the academy
you run from fear,

47:35.887 --> 47:36.919
you give it power.

47:36.921 --> 47:39.589
So, is that what you do?

47:39.591 --> 47:41.991
You face things?

47:41.993 --> 47:44.227
I try.

47:49.499 --> 47:51.234
You got to go.

47:51.236 --> 47:53.302
Yeah. Sorry.
It's okay.

47:53.304 --> 47:56.105
Go and, uh, face your fear.

47:56.107 --> 47:58.007
But not through that door.

47:58.009 --> 47:59.609
That's the water.
That way.

47:59.611 --> 48:02.278
Right.
Yeah.

48:04.314 --> 48:06.616
Thanks for the shellfish.

48:06.618 --> 48:08.517
It's nantucket Pearl.

48:10.120 --> 48:12.188
Bye.

48:17.461 --> 48:20.029
Johnson: You were right
about the duchess.

48:20.031 --> 48:21.964
Wasn't an accident.

48:21.966 --> 48:23.532
Who's that?

48:26.536 --> 48:27.670
A friend.

48:27.672 --> 48:30.506
Nice.

48:30.508 --> 48:34.644
Here. They digitally aged her
like 25 years.

48:34.646 --> 48:37.480
Does that look like the woman
you saw with Tony ramos?

48:37.482 --> 48:38.547
Angela Franco.

48:38.549 --> 48:40.416
Her car's registered
to him.

48:40.418 --> 48:41.651
Yeah.

48:41.653 --> 48:43.286
She lives in the condo
in front.

48:43.288 --> 48:45.621
Angela Franco.

48:45.623 --> 48:48.024
Angela --
that's angel frank.

48:48.026 --> 48:51.060
Yeah. Why? Does that mean
something to you?

48:51.062 --> 48:53.462
Frank was my father's name.

49:42.312 --> 49:44.647
Amputation always goes
so much better

49:44.649 --> 49:46.582
when it's
computer assisted.

49:46.584 --> 49:48.284
Help!

49:48.286 --> 49:49.685
Help me!

49:49.687 --> 49:53.055
Unfortunately,
we don't have that luxury.

49:58.595 --> 50:00.596
We're gonna
try this again.

50:00.598 --> 50:03.332
Now, just nod when you're ready
to talk about Lola.

50:08.239 --> 50:10.439
Shut up!

50:16.247 --> 50:18.047
Doyle: Tony!

50:18.049 --> 50:21.083
Open up.
I know you're in there.

50:24.721 --> 50:26.589
Hi.

50:26.591 --> 50:28.157
I'm looking for Tony.

50:31.361 --> 50:33.129
He just, um...

50:35.065 --> 50:36.432
Can I help you?

50:40.270 --> 50:43.339
Tell Tony to call me.

50:52.049 --> 50:54.750
Man: Tony,
who's that guy in there?

50:54.752 --> 50:56.519
I'm coming over.

51:01.391 --> 51:05.061
Angela!
Angela!

51:07.531 --> 51:08.798
Go.

51:10.634 --> 51:12.368
Tony.

51:14.572 --> 51:15.571
Are you okay?

51:15.573 --> 51:17.540
Go get 'em.

51:17.542 --> 51:19.108
Go get 'em!

51:21.478 --> 51:24.380
Oh, my god.
It's Lola!

51:24.382 --> 51:26.682
Eli, stop!
Eli, get in the car!

51:26.684 --> 51:27.817
Eli, stop!

51:27.819 --> 51:28.651
Eli!

51:28.653 --> 51:30.152
Aah!

51:30.154 --> 51:30.820
Eli!

51:30.822 --> 51:32.521
Not now, Eli!

51:34.157 --> 51:35.558
Eli!

51:35.560 --> 51:37.626
Lola:

51:37.628 --> 51:40.763
Eli, get in the car!

51:45.869 --> 51:48.270
Lola: Beth?

51:48.272 --> 51:51.307
What are you doing?

51:58.381 --> 51:59.748
No!

51:59.750 --> 52:01.417
What the hell?

52:01.419 --> 52:03.352
Beth!

52:09.393 --> 52:11.660
No!

52:11.662 --> 52:14.263
What are you gonna do,
call the cops?

52:16.900 --> 52:21.537
Eli, get in the car!
Get in the car!

52:23.407 --> 52:26.675
Tony: Angela! Angela!

52:26.677 --> 52:28.744
Lola: Tony!

52:35.819 --> 52:39.922
Great. Yeah, okay.
See you tomorrow. Bye.

52:39.924 --> 52:41.824
I've got a job
in the morning.

52:41.826 --> 52:44.426
-Great.
-Over on hulbert Avenue.

52:44.428 --> 52:46.629
An Eric something
or another.

52:46.631 --> 52:49.532
Says he wants
a holistic massage.

52:49.534 --> 52:51.567
So, why don't you let me
buy you lunch after?

52:51.569 --> 52:53.169
How about
the white elephant?

52:53.171 --> 52:54.703
Cool. Sounds good.
See ya.

52:54.705 --> 52:57.773
Have you ever gotten a massage?
Clara's the best.

52:57.775 --> 53:01.243
No. Well,
not professionally.

53:01.245 --> 53:04.180
Oh...

53:07.184 --> 53:10.586
You having fun playing
Sherlock Holmes, Mr. detective?

53:13.490 --> 53:16.258
You know, he never said,
"elementary, my dear Watson"

53:16.260 --> 53:17.526
in any of the books.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.628
Line from the movies.

53:19.630 --> 53:23.599
Listen, Billy,
i got to tell you.

53:23.601 --> 53:26.502
You're on a short list of
persons of interest

53:26.504 --> 53:27.937
to the local police.

53:27.939 --> 53:30.639
Now, I know
you didn't kill her,

53:30.641 --> 53:33.909
but did the duchess speak
to any strangers,

53:33.911 --> 53:37.313
anybody she didn't know
at the barn party?

53:37.315 --> 53:39.648
I could really use your help
on this one.

53:39.650 --> 53:43.485
Help?
You want my help?

53:43.487 --> 53:47.690
She'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

53:47.692 --> 53:50.726
I looked into you today.
I know all about you.

53:50.728 --> 53:54.930
I know all about Boston and
your partner and your sister.

53:54.932 --> 53:56.732
Who's next?

53:56.734 --> 53:59.501
Melissa?

54:06.610 --> 54:08.577
Hey.

54:08.579 --> 54:11.547
Why'd you leave?

54:11.549 --> 54:13.582
I'm not good company
right now.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.384
Okay, that's fine.

54:15.386 --> 54:17.753
Can we talk?

54:17.755 --> 54:20.556
Sure.

54:20.558 --> 54:24.660
So, uh, why
are you really here?

54:24.662 --> 54:26.562
'Cause Billy told me
all kinds of stuff.

54:26.564 --> 54:28.397
He said that --
that you got suspended

54:28.399 --> 54:29.465
from the Boston police.

54:29.467 --> 54:30.733
I'm on leave.

54:30.735 --> 54:32.668
Because of your
partner's murder?

54:32.670 --> 54:34.737
I'm not allowed
to investigate it.

54:34.739 --> 54:36.338
But you are anyway.

54:36.340 --> 54:37.773
Correct.

54:37.775 --> 54:40.776
It's also true that I was shot
with her gun

54:40.778 --> 54:42.845
and she was shot
with mine.

54:42.847 --> 54:45.414
Some people think
that I did it.

54:46.983 --> 54:49.818
Did you know she was pregnant
at the time?

54:51.788 --> 54:53.522
No.

54:55.725 --> 54:59.328
Before Maggie died...

54:59.330 --> 55:02.698
She said two things.

55:02.700 --> 55:05.334
A rose.

55:05.336 --> 55:08.304
A crown.

55:08.306 --> 55:09.538
Besides the restaurant,

55:09.540 --> 55:11.440
does that mean
anything to you?

55:11.442 --> 55:15.711
Um, there's a shoal out there
called the rose and crown.

55:15.713 --> 55:18.047
It was named after the ships
that were wrecked on it,

55:18.049 --> 55:20.616
and I think the restaurant
was named after the shoal.

55:25.489 --> 55:28.023
The duchess called the island
the grey lady.

55:28.025 --> 55:29.892
Is that
'cause all the fog?

55:29.894 --> 55:31.794
Yeah.

55:31.796 --> 55:34.029
But I'd like to think
it's also because...

55:34.031 --> 55:37.666
Not everything here
is black and white.

55:37.668 --> 55:41.337
Even the people aren't always
what they seem.

55:47.544 --> 55:50.079
Do you want to come back
to my place?

55:50.081 --> 55:52.848
Just to talk.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.650
It's the cottage
on the beach

55:54.652 --> 55:56.485
over next
to sail's baskets.

55:58.855 --> 56:01.023
There's something
i have to do first.

56:01.025 --> 56:03.425
I'll meet you there.

56:31.988 --> 56:34.423
You got balls
coming back here.

56:34.425 --> 56:35.591
What happened?

56:35.593 --> 56:37.693
It's nothing
that we can't handle.

56:37.695 --> 56:41.864
That guy earlier, you were
with him in Tony's house.

56:41.866 --> 56:43.866
Who was he?
I don't know. Why?

56:45.468 --> 56:47.803
I want to talk to Angela.

56:47.805 --> 56:49.037
Not tonight.

56:51.808 --> 56:54.076
You tell Angela
to call me.

56:54.078 --> 56:56.612
We have the card
you left here before.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.521
Marty.

57:05.523 --> 57:07.656
Found Lola.
-Yeah?

57:07.658 --> 57:09.425
Well, guess what.
I found your cousin Beth.

57:09.427 --> 57:11.994
She escaped from
the mass psych center

57:11.996 --> 57:13.896
18 months ago with some guy.

57:13.898 --> 57:15.564
I'm gonna take this.

57:15.566 --> 57:17.199
You have a description?

57:17.201 --> 57:18.967
Even better.
I got a visitor's photo.

57:18.969 --> 57:22.137
He looks military.
Buzz cut, full bdus.

57:22.139 --> 57:24.673
Looks like he just stepped off
the front lines.

57:27.577 --> 57:28.944
That's him.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.779
Let me ask you
something, okay?

57:30.781 --> 57:34.583
Why would this guy be killing
your sister and Maggie

57:34.585 --> 57:37.119
and people you barely met in
nantucket like the duchess?

57:37.121 --> 57:40.456
Listen, I don't know.
I'm not sure.

57:40.458 --> 57:43.592
Okay.
I'm coming over there.

57:45.729 --> 57:47.463
Melissa: And Maggie?

57:47.465 --> 57:50.699
You really loved her,
didn't you?

57:50.701 --> 57:53.902
I still do.

57:53.904 --> 57:56.171
The night you bought
my painting,

57:56.173 --> 57:59.141
I had this image of someone
surrounding you,

57:59.143 --> 58:00.609
protecting you.

58:00.611 --> 58:02.678
What do you mean?

58:02.680 --> 58:05.247
My mother,
she used to say that

58:05.249 --> 58:09.718
sometimes when people die
violent deaths,

58:09.720 --> 58:14.490
they linger in this life
looking for peace.

58:14.492 --> 58:17.493
We can't hold on to them.

58:17.495 --> 58:19.862
If you love somebody,
you have --

58:19.864 --> 58:21.530
you have to let them go.

58:24.901 --> 58:28.971
If Maggie's still around,
how come I can't feel her?

58:31.642 --> 58:35.210
Because you're like<i> this.</i>

58:36.646 --> 58:38.547
You're not open.

58:41.251 --> 58:44.920
In your heart, do you know
who killed her?

58:47.190 --> 58:50.993
I think it might have something
to do with my family.

58:55.899 --> 58:59.768
The hand that holds the hand
later holds the knife.

59:25.862 --> 59:27.696
Man: Lola, look at me,
look at me.

59:27.698 --> 59:29.831
Lola, it's gonna be all right,
all right? Now get inside.

59:29.833 --> 59:32.868
Go inside. It's all right.
I got this.

59:57.294 --> 59:59.194
Boy: Dad?

1:00:19.115 --> 1:00:21.783
Where are you?

1:00:26.223 --> 1:00:28.023
Hi.

1:00:28.025 --> 1:00:29.791
Hi.

1:00:29.793 --> 1:00:32.127
Let me, uh,
help you with that.

1:00:32.129 --> 1:00:35.897
Just...Down this way.

1:00:35.899 --> 1:00:37.666
Okay.

1:00:37.668 --> 1:00:39.735
Sorry it's a little...

1:00:39.737 --> 1:00:42.204
Chilly inside,
but I'm renting, and...

1:00:42.206 --> 1:00:45.874
That's --
...I haven't figured out
the heat.

1:00:48.244 --> 1:00:50.412
So, how did you hear
about me?

1:00:50.414 --> 1:00:53.815
The lady at the guest house
where I was staying.

1:00:53.817 --> 1:00:56.985
Oh. There you go.

1:01:03.693 --> 1:01:06.995
Can I get you some coffee
while I...I get changed?

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:08.697
Oh, do you have
herbal tea?

1:01:08.699 --> 1:01:11.233
I'll check.

1:01:11.235 --> 1:01:13.835
Which guest house
is that?

1:01:13.837 --> 1:01:15.837
The Carlisle.

1:01:15.839 --> 1:01:18.006
Oh, you must mean Sally.

1:01:18.008 --> 1:01:19.808
She's a really good friend
of mine.

1:01:19.810 --> 1:01:21.943
She's an absolute dote.

1:01:25.015 --> 1:01:27.215
Is that an Irish accent?

1:01:27.217 --> 1:01:30.085
Yes.
Beautiful cork.

1:01:30.087 --> 1:01:31.420
Lots of us came over here

1:01:31.422 --> 1:01:34.056
when we were in college
just for the summer.

1:01:34.058 --> 1:01:36.224
I fell in love
and ended up staying.

1:01:36.226 --> 1:01:37.859
How's about you?

1:01:37.861 --> 1:01:39.461
Are you happy here?

1:01:39.463 --> 1:01:43.165
I don't know that I'm
ever really happy.

1:01:43.167 --> 1:01:46.068
I guess I just do
what I have to.

1:01:57.880 --> 1:02:00.082
I want to watch.

1:02:00.084 --> 1:02:02.284
Go upstairs.

1:02:02.286 --> 1:02:03.785
Perry.

1:02:03.787 --> 1:02:05.287
Please!

1:02:18.234 --> 1:02:21.870
Can I get you some honey
in your tea?

1:02:21.872 --> 1:02:23.772
That'd be great,
thank you.

1:02:30.980 --> 1:02:32.380
Why are you dressed --

1:02:33.883 --> 1:02:35.317
Eric?

1:02:35.319 --> 1:02:37.352
Eric.

1:02:37.354 --> 1:02:38.987
Say something, Eric,
you're -- you're, uh --

1:02:38.989 --> 1:02:40.122
you're scaring me.

1:02:40.124 --> 1:02:41.957
We're going
for a boat ride.

1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:58.473
Woman: Stop!
You're gonna kill him!

1:02:58.475 --> 1:03:00.809
You're gonna kill him!

1:03:00.811 --> 1:03:01.977
Stop!

1:03:01.979 --> 1:03:03.478
Eli, stop!

1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:05.814
Eli, there's a way
to do this!

1:03:05.816 --> 1:03:07.482
--Let me do this!

1:03:07.484 --> 1:03:09.184
Don't ever touch me!

1:03:09.186 --> 1:03:11.920
Don't ever touch me again!

1:03:14.490 --> 1:03:16.191
Eli.

1:03:16.193 --> 1:03:19.361
Eli, put the gun down.

1:03:19.363 --> 1:03:22.497
Eli, put the gun down.

1:03:30.306 --> 1:03:33.141
<i> Hey, Clara, just calling to</i>
<i> remind you about lunch.</i>

1:03:33.143 --> 1:03:35.477
<i> I guess I'll see you at</i>
<i> the white elephant at 1:00.</i>

1:03:35.479 --> 1:03:36.578
<i> All right, see you then.</i>

1:03:36.580 --> 1:03:39.147
That's his girlfriend.

1:03:39.149 --> 1:03:40.415
I'll be there instead.

1:03:40.417 --> 1:03:42.017
Eli, put the gun down.

1:03:42.019 --> 1:03:43.819
This is her number.

1:03:43.821 --> 1:03:45.921
Call her when I tell you.

1:03:45.923 --> 1:03:49.324
Tell her to pick up Clara
from here.

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:51.827
Eli!

1:04:22.024 --> 1:04:25.460
Mr. Doyle, have you met your
new upstairs neighbor, Eli?

1:04:25.462 --> 1:04:28.196
Not me. Her.

1:04:29.899 --> 1:04:32.500
Oh, hi.
Yes, we've met.

1:04:32.502 --> 1:04:35.604
I moved in yesterday.
You must have been out.

1:04:35.606 --> 1:04:37.138
Hello.

1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:39.174
I need a three-letter word
meaning zero.

1:04:39.176 --> 1:04:42.477
-Nil. N-i-l.
-Duh.

1:04:42.479 --> 1:04:44.145
I love puzzles.

1:04:44.147 --> 1:04:46.514
You'll be sharing the bathroom,
Mr. Doyle,

1:04:46.516 --> 1:04:48.984
so please put the toilet seat
back down.

1:04:48.986 --> 1:04:51.286
I have a brother.
Nothing shocks me.

1:04:51.288 --> 1:04:53.255
Nothing?
How about this clue?

1:04:53.257 --> 1:04:55.257
17 across.

1:04:55.259 --> 1:04:57.959
"The liquor used
in a whale's orgasm,

1:04:57.961 --> 1:05:00.161
a Cape Cod drink.
Five letters."

1:05:00.163 --> 1:05:01.630
I didn't know whales
had orgasms.

1:05:01.632 --> 1:05:02.998
Oh, yeah.

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.399
Try vodka.

1:05:04.401 --> 1:05:05.567
Love to.
Got some?

1:05:06.937 --> 1:05:09.337
V-o-d-k-a.

1:05:13.377 --> 1:05:16.011
-Johnson.
-A body has just been found.

1:05:16.013 --> 1:05:17.612
White female, 30s.

1:05:17.614 --> 1:05:21.082
And, Doyle, there's a word
cut into her back.

1:05:21.084 --> 1:05:23.652
Doyle:
You sure it's a word?

1:05:23.654 --> 1:05:26.688
Yeah. The word "why."

1:05:26.690 --> 1:05:29.424
There's the woman
who found the body.

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:31.026
Did you get through
to your friend?

1:05:31.028 --> 1:05:32.527
What's her name?
Melissa?

1:05:32.529 --> 1:05:34.496
No.

1:05:41.370 --> 1:05:44.139
Post a couple of your men
to watch our backs.

1:05:44.141 --> 1:05:46.441
It's my guy,
he may have set a trap.

1:05:47.376 --> 1:05:49.044
Macvicker.

1:05:49.046 --> 1:05:50.946
Whoever did this
may still be around.

1:05:50.948 --> 1:05:53.281
Keep your eyes peeled,
make sure no one approaches.

1:05:53.283 --> 1:05:54.582
Okay.

1:05:56.352 --> 1:05:59.287
Woman:
It's stressful, you know?

1:05:59.289 --> 1:06:01.389
If you really want to know,
this is really stressful.

1:06:01.391 --> 1:06:03.258
I've never seen
a dead body before.

1:06:08.030 --> 1:06:09.597
They're here.

1:06:09.599 --> 1:06:11.433
You in place?

1:06:22.111 --> 1:06:25.380
Yes. Get ready.

1:06:32.755 --> 1:06:35.757
Oh, my god.

1:06:35.759 --> 1:06:38.493
Her name's Clara Burke.

1:06:38.495 --> 1:06:40.228
She's Melissa's
best friend.

1:06:40.230 --> 1:06:41.663
I have to warn her.

1:06:49.338 --> 1:06:51.473
-Hello?
-Melissa, hi.

1:06:51.475 --> 1:06:55.076
This is Eric cook,
Clara's morning massage client.

1:06:55.078 --> 1:06:57.579
I know that she was planning
on meeting you for lunch.

1:06:57.581 --> 1:07:00.382
She's wondering if you could
just pick her up at my place.

1:07:00.384 --> 1:07:03.551
225 hulbert Avenue.

1:07:03.553 --> 1:07:07.122
Okay, okay.
Uh, 225 hulbert ave?

1:07:07.124 --> 1:07:09.324
-And she'll be waiting for you.
-Okay, thanks.

1:07:16.566 --> 1:07:17.732
-Hey.
-It's me, Doyle.

1:07:17.734 --> 1:07:19.401
I know.
I saw you called.

1:07:19.403 --> 1:07:21.102
I was at the studio.
-Where are you now?

1:07:21.104 --> 1:07:22.604
I'm at the
white elephant now,

1:07:22.606 --> 1:07:24.172
but I have to go
pick up Clara.

1:07:24.174 --> 1:07:25.673
What do you mean?

1:07:25.675 --> 1:07:27.242
Oh, her morning client called

1:07:27.244 --> 1:07:28.410
and said she needed a ride
from his place.

1:07:28.412 --> 1:07:29.411
What's the address?

1:07:29.413 --> 1:07:33.181
Uh, 225 hulbert?
Why?

1:07:33.183 --> 1:07:36.518
Okay. I want you to walk
to the water right now,

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:38.553
look to the right
past the hotel.

1:07:38.555 --> 1:07:41.256
My place is the safe harbor
guest house.

1:07:41.258 --> 1:07:43.291
Wait, I have
to go get Clara.

1:07:43.293 --> 1:07:46.294
Please do as I ask.
It's me. I'm a cop.

1:07:46.296 --> 1:07:48.496
My place is the safe harbor
guest house.

1:07:48.498 --> 1:07:51.099
I want you to ask for miss cash
and sit tight.

1:07:51.101 --> 1:07:52.434
Why?

1:07:52.436 --> 1:07:54.569
There's been another death.

1:07:54.571 --> 1:07:56.538
We'll send a squad car
to pick you up

1:07:56.540 --> 1:07:57.839
and take you to the station.

1:07:57.841 --> 1:07:59.274
We'll take care of Clara.

1:07:59.276 --> 1:08:01.342
Why don't you
just tell her?

1:08:01.344 --> 1:08:03.144
I don't want her
to have a panic attack.

1:08:03.146 --> 1:08:05.113
20 minutes.
I want you to be safe.

1:08:05.115 --> 1:08:06.748
Call me if
there's any problem.

1:08:06.750 --> 1:08:08.149
Okay.

1:08:16.092 --> 1:08:17.392
Perry: What do you mean
you lost her?

1:08:17.394 --> 1:08:18.493
I'm almost back
at the house.

1:08:18.495 --> 1:08:19.661
Find her!

1:08:19.663 --> 1:08:21.529
I've got her.

1:08:21.531 --> 1:08:24.265
Pull the boat up to the town
ramp at children's beach.

1:08:24.267 --> 1:08:25.767
Clara, I can't pick you up,

1:08:25.769 --> 1:08:28.369
so, um, I'm gonna send a cab
for you, but call me.

1:08:28.371 --> 1:08:30.205
Call me when you get this.

1:08:38.214 --> 1:08:40.381
Melissa, hi.

1:08:40.383 --> 1:08:43.184
I thought that was you.
I met you at your art gallery.

1:08:43.186 --> 1:08:45.620
I was the one who spilled
the wine, remember?

1:08:45.622 --> 1:08:47.155
A-are you looking
for Doyle?

1:08:47.157 --> 1:08:49.557
Yeah. We-- no.
Miss cash, actually.

1:08:49.559 --> 1:08:51.126
Oh, I just gave her
a ride to town.

1:08:51.128 --> 1:08:52.494
Can I -- can I give her
a message?

1:08:52.496 --> 1:08:55.163
Um, no.
I need to make a phone call.

1:08:56.366 --> 1:08:58.333
I'm sorry to hear
about Clara.

1:08:58.335 --> 1:08:59.667
What?

1:08:59.669 --> 1:09:01.136
You don't know?

1:09:01.138 --> 1:09:02.570
I just heard
about it in town.

1:09:02.572 --> 1:09:04.172
What?
They --

1:09:04.174 --> 1:09:05.740
what?!
They found her body
on the beach.

1:09:05.742 --> 1:09:09.444
She was...I'm so sorry.
She was killed.

1:09:09.446 --> 1:09:11.179
The police
are investigating.

1:09:11.181 --> 1:09:12.514
What?
Yes.

1:09:12.516 --> 1:09:14.182
This morning.
No.

1:09:14.184 --> 1:09:16.217
Murdered this --
this morning.
No, no.

1:09:16.219 --> 1:09:17.418
Yes.
No!

1:09:17.420 --> 1:09:18.520
I thought that you knew.
No.

1:09:18.522 --> 1:09:19.721
I'm so sorry.
No!

1:09:19.723 --> 1:09:20.855
Oh, my god,
are you all right?

1:09:20.857 --> 1:09:22.257
Come -- come here.

1:09:22.259 --> 1:09:24.159
I can't --
i can't -- I can't...

1:09:24.161 --> 1:09:26.427
I'm so sorry.
Come here and sit, sit.

1:09:26.429 --> 1:09:27.495
I have to send help.

1:09:27.497 --> 1:09:29.797
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

1:09:29.799 --> 1:09:32.567
Oh, god. Oh, my god.
Oh, god.

1:09:32.569 --> 1:09:33.735
I think someone's
trying to kill me.

1:09:33.737 --> 1:09:34.802
What?
I think --

1:09:34.804 --> 1:09:36.538
no, no, no.

1:09:36.540 --> 1:09:37.839
I think whoever killed Clara,
i think he called me!

1:09:37.841 --> 1:09:39.574
I think he called me
this morning.

1:09:39.576 --> 1:09:41.676
I think -- oh, god, he just
called me this morning.

1:09:41.678 --> 1:09:42.510
I'll call the police.

1:09:42.512 --> 1:09:43.745
No! No!

1:09:43.747 --> 1:09:45.180
No, no.

1:09:45.182 --> 1:09:46.281
Just come sit down.

1:09:46.283 --> 1:09:49.517
No!

1:09:49.519 --> 1:09:51.819
-Is she all right?
-I don't know.

1:09:51.821 --> 1:09:54.189
-I know her.
-I'll call for help.

1:09:54.191 --> 1:09:56.491
Melissa, it's Heather.

1:09:56.493 --> 1:09:58.593
Change of plans.
Dump the boat.

1:09:58.595 --> 1:10:00.295
The car will be here.

1:10:07.570 --> 1:10:09.904
I don't think so, Mr. Doyle.

1:10:11.942 --> 1:10:13.441
I'll call 911.

1:10:13.443 --> 1:10:15.210
No, no, no, I want you
to take me with you.

1:10:15.212 --> 1:10:16.377
Okay, okay.
Kids, back in the car now!

1:10:18.815 --> 1:10:21.583
I'll come with you!

1:10:21.585 --> 1:10:24.586
<i> Hey, nantucket. This is Kate</i>
<i> with your local forecast.</i>

1:10:24.588 --> 1:10:27.855
<i> We've got a nor'easter</i>
<i> moving in as I speak.</i>

1:10:27.857 --> 1:10:30.725
Now, I want to make sure you get
this prescription filled.

1:10:30.727 --> 1:10:32.694
I will.
Thank you, Tim.

1:10:32.696 --> 1:10:34.562
Did you call the police?
-Yes.

1:10:34.564 --> 1:10:35.730
Doyle's meeting us
at his place.

1:10:35.732 --> 1:10:36.898
I'll drive you there.

1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:38.967
Oh, uh, my --
my -- my phone.

1:10:38.969 --> 1:10:41.803
No, no, no, no, I found it.
It's in our car.

1:10:41.805 --> 1:10:43.605
I called my brother.

1:10:43.607 --> 1:10:44.606
-Hi.
-Hey.

1:10:44.608 --> 1:10:45.673
This is him.

1:10:45.675 --> 1:10:47.575
-Oh, hi.
-Let's go.

1:10:47.577 --> 1:10:50.278
Melissa, this is Perry.

1:10:53.682 --> 1:10:56.351
-What's Lola's last name?
-Doyle.

1:10:56.353 --> 1:10:59.020
Doyle is d-o-y-l-e.
-Y-l-e.

1:10:59.022 --> 1:11:01.389
Yes, I know how to spell
your last name.

1:11:03.425 --> 1:11:04.692
He's spelling my name.

1:11:04.694 --> 1:11:06.494
What?
Well, check it out.

1:11:06.496 --> 1:11:08.663
What if the circle on the back
of the duchess is an "o"

1:11:08.665 --> 1:11:12.300
and today's word, "why," that
he carved on Clara's back

1:11:12.302 --> 1:11:14.035
stands for the letter "y"?

1:11:14.037 --> 1:11:17.472
And the number 1 on
Maggie's back is an "l."

1:11:17.474 --> 1:11:20.708
And this 3 here
is a backwards "e."

1:11:20.710 --> 1:11:24.379
O-y-l-e.

1:11:24.381 --> 1:11:26.648
Bingo.
You got it.

1:11:28.651 --> 1:11:31.986
But we got to get this guy
before he gets to "d."

1:11:33.355 --> 1:11:35.957
Doyle.
I want you off my island.

1:11:35.959 --> 1:11:38.559
Until then, I just talked
to your commissioner.

1:11:38.561 --> 1:11:40.528
You will do nothing
to further

1:11:40.530 --> 1:11:42.964
this investigation
without my permission.

1:11:42.966 --> 1:11:44.065
Now, do you have a problem
with that?

1:11:44.067 --> 1:11:45.466
Yeah.

1:11:45.468 --> 1:11:46.801
This might be your island,
chief,

1:11:46.803 --> 1:11:48.303
but this is our case,

1:11:48.305 --> 1:11:49.704
and this guy right here
is a good cop.

1:11:49.706 --> 1:11:50.938
You carrying a weapon?

1:11:53.475 --> 1:11:56.511
You have been judged
and found wanting.

1:11:56.513 --> 1:11:57.979
What does that mean?

1:11:57.981 --> 1:11:59.013
Writing in the other room.

1:11:59.015 --> 1:12:02.383
Phrase in sanskrit.

1:12:02.385 --> 1:12:03.951
Right.
Maloney, you stay with me.

1:12:03.953 --> 1:12:06.020
Doyle, go with Johnson,
get your files.

1:12:06.022 --> 1:12:08.423
Check it out.
Chief.

1:12:09.591 --> 1:12:11.025
Chief:
All right, listen up.

1:12:11.027 --> 1:12:13.494
I want a full briefing
in my office in one hour!

1:12:13.496 --> 1:12:14.529
Let me see it.

1:12:16.432 --> 1:12:18.800
-Melissa!
-I got her.

1:12:18.802 --> 1:12:20.968
She left the cottage hospital
20 minutes ago.

1:12:20.970 --> 1:12:22.937
What'd she check in for?
Panic attack.

1:12:22.939 --> 1:12:24.772
Some "friend" told her
about Clara.

1:12:24.774 --> 1:12:26.007
Friend?
Exactly.

1:12:26.009 --> 1:12:27.742
Had a name?
Didn't give one.

1:12:27.744 --> 1:12:28.943
Description?

1:12:28.945 --> 1:12:30.778
Caucasian, blonde,
in her 30s.

1:12:30.780 --> 1:12:32.980
They also said Tony ramos
had visitors yesterday --

1:12:32.982 --> 1:12:34.816
a man and woman
looking for your aunt.

1:12:34.818 --> 1:12:35.950
They cut off his finger.

1:12:36.986 --> 1:12:38.720
It's them.

1:12:38.722 --> 1:12:40.655
Yeah.

1:12:40.657 --> 1:12:43.091
This is
father Richard riando.

1:12:43.093 --> 1:12:47.061
I've got a woman here who gave
me your phone number.

1:13:07.149 --> 1:13:10.051
-Is it her?
-She's in there.

1:13:10.053 --> 1:13:11.552
At least I<i> think</i> it's her.

1:13:11.554 --> 1:13:12.787
I'll keep watch out front.

1:13:12.789 --> 1:13:14.722
We got 15 minutes
before the briefing.

1:13:29.872 --> 1:13:31.973
You lied to me.

1:13:34.576 --> 1:13:37.979
You said you weren't Lola.

1:13:37.981 --> 1:13:41.482
And because of that, a friend
of mine was killed today.

1:13:43.019 --> 1:13:44.852
Come on out!

1:13:44.854 --> 1:13:46.421
Hands where I can see them.

1:13:47.756 --> 1:13:49.857
No, it's Tony.

1:13:49.859 --> 1:13:54.128
For this finger,
I'll cut off his head.

1:13:54.130 --> 1:13:57.999
When you go after them,
you call me.

1:13:58.001 --> 1:14:00.701
And you, tell him
what you told me.

1:14:23.725 --> 1:14:26.761
So, it's Beth, right?

1:14:29.898 --> 1:14:33.968
After your mother died,
your father and I became close.

1:14:35.971 --> 1:14:39.040
My husband was an animal.

1:14:40.642 --> 1:14:43.578
Your father was an angel.
He saved me.

1:14:43.580 --> 1:14:45.079
Girl: Mommy?

1:14:45.081 --> 1:14:46.581
Frank!

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:48.616
- What?
-Frank, get up, get up.

1:14:48.618 --> 1:14:51.853
It's Beth. Come on, get up!
-Mommy?

1:14:51.855 --> 1:14:54.188
Mommy, I'm home!
-One second, baby!

1:14:54.190 --> 1:14:56.190
Mommy will be right there!

1:14:59.261 --> 1:15:00.828
Mommy!

1:15:00.830 --> 1:15:02.063
Hi, baby!

1:15:02.065 --> 1:15:04.866
There you are.
How's my girl?

1:15:04.868 --> 1:15:06.267
How was school?

1:15:07.804 --> 1:15:08.202
Tim.

1:15:12.708 --> 1:15:16.043
What's going on, frank?

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:20.681
Look, Tim,
let's go outside.

1:15:20.683 --> 1:15:22.183
Piece of shit.

1:15:22.185 --> 1:15:25.019
Dude, you're drunk.
You don't want to be doing this.

1:15:27.823 --> 1:15:29.290
Come here.
Stay here, okay,

1:15:29.292 --> 1:15:30.658
and protect
your baby brother.

1:15:32.662 --> 1:15:35.830
Tim, stop!
Tim, listen to me!

1:15:35.832 --> 1:15:37.031
Tim, stop it!

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:39.200
Stop it!
Stop it!

1:15:39.202 --> 1:15:41.969
You'll kill him!
Stop!

1:15:41.971 --> 1:15:44.105
Tim: Bitch!
With my brother!

1:15:44.107 --> 1:15:46.073
With my fucking brother?!

1:15:46.075 --> 1:15:47.608
No!

1:15:49.711 --> 1:15:50.811
No!

1:15:50.813 --> 1:15:52.246
I'll kill you!

1:15:54.951 --> 1:15:56.317
No!

1:15:56.319 --> 1:15:57.318
Tim!

1:16:21.944 --> 1:16:23.811
What have I done?

1:16:37.259 --> 1:16:40.861
So, Beth is killing people
to get back at my father?

1:16:40.863 --> 1:16:42.830
For killing her father.

1:16:42.832 --> 1:16:44.665
She wrote about it.

1:16:46.301 --> 1:16:50.738
The doctors said
she...Disassociated,

1:16:50.740 --> 1:16:52.840
but she's --

1:16:52.842 --> 1:16:55.276
I don't know what she is.

1:16:55.278 --> 1:16:58.846
You have no idea
how much she hates us.

1:16:58.848 --> 1:17:00.181
Look.

1:17:00.183 --> 1:17:02.183
Look at that picture.

1:17:02.185 --> 1:17:03.884
Look.

1:17:03.886 --> 1:17:05.086
That day at the beach.

1:17:05.088 --> 1:17:07.989
Look what she did
to our family.

1:17:07.991 --> 1:17:12.994
"Five fold misery.

1:17:12.996 --> 1:17:16.664
What he hath done
must be done to him."

1:17:19.101 --> 1:17:21.035
That's not what
the Bible means.

1:17:21.037 --> 1:17:22.803
They've twisted it.

1:17:24.873 --> 1:17:26.641
Who?

1:17:26.643 --> 1:17:29.644
Beth and...

1:17:31.313 --> 1:17:33.781
...and her brother,
Perry.

1:17:34.750 --> 1:17:38.653
He was just a baby when Tim
died, don't you remember?

1:17:38.655 --> 1:17:40.988
No.

1:17:40.990 --> 1:17:44.225
She raised him, not me.
I couldn't.

1:17:44.227 --> 1:17:47.161
When was the last time
you saw them?

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:51.032
Hadn't been for years.

1:17:51.034 --> 1:17:54.301
Then last year,
she tried to kill herself.

1:17:54.303 --> 1:17:56.737
He came back to save her.

1:17:56.739 --> 1:18:00.307
She tried to do it again,
so now he does what she wants.

1:18:00.309 --> 1:18:03.878
They burnt my place down,
so I ran away.

1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:05.279
I came back here.
I hid.

1:18:05.281 --> 1:18:07.381
And rose & crown?

1:18:07.383 --> 1:18:10.051
Was a place that Tim and i
used to meet.

1:18:12.354 --> 1:18:15.723
I had some earrings made,
and I gave them to Beth.

1:18:15.725 --> 1:18:18.125
Why didn't you tell me
about them?

1:18:25.133 --> 1:18:30.037
I've never told anybody
anything.

1:18:30.039 --> 1:18:32.473
I didn't know how to.

1:18:35.010 --> 1:18:39.080
I'm a drunk, Jimmy.

1:18:44.387 --> 1:18:47.288
I killed your uncle...

1:18:47.290 --> 1:18:52.259
Not your father.
I stabbed him.

1:18:52.261 --> 1:18:53.761
I saw my father
with the knife.

1:18:53.763 --> 1:18:54.929
No.

1:18:54.931 --> 1:18:56.163
I saw him.

1:18:56.165 --> 1:18:58.132
No!
He was choking me.

1:18:58.134 --> 1:19:01.836
I couldn't breathe,
and I grabbed for something.

1:19:01.838 --> 1:19:03.304
I didn't mean to.

1:19:08.444 --> 1:19:11.245
Oh!

1:19:16.284 --> 1:19:20.955
Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

1:19:20.957 --> 1:19:24.458
Sorry for your sister
and your partner and...

1:19:27.062 --> 1:19:29.163
Find Beth.

1:19:29.165 --> 1:19:31.799
And you tell her --
you tell her that I did it.

1:19:31.801 --> 1:19:33.834
I killed him.
You tell her the truth.

1:19:35.505 --> 1:19:37.304
Johnson: Doyle.

1:19:37.306 --> 1:19:39.440
We got to go.

1:19:47.816 --> 1:19:49.383
No!

1:19:49.385 --> 1:19:51.886
If I tell you something,
you promise not to hurt them.

1:19:54.457 --> 1:19:58.359
You promise me, Jimmy!

1:20:28.089 --> 1:20:30.291
Jimmy.

1:20:30.293 --> 1:20:32.126
Promise.

1:20:53.149 --> 1:20:57.151
Man: You got five minutes.
Just grab every box you got.

1:21:00.589 --> 1:21:02.022
Can you help me?

1:21:02.024 --> 1:21:03.591
Johnson, you got this?

1:21:03.593 --> 1:21:06.026
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Go get your files.

1:21:37.125 --> 1:21:38.592
Are you looking
for Melissa?

1:21:38.594 --> 1:21:41.929
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm completely covered.

1:21:41.931 --> 1:21:43.497
Come in.

1:21:48.904 --> 1:21:51.138
This is hers.

1:21:51.140 --> 1:21:52.273
Oh, yes, it is.
Take it.

1:21:52.275 --> 1:21:53.674
Uh, she left it
in my car.

1:21:53.676 --> 1:21:57.244
I...Took her
to the hospital.

1:21:57.246 --> 1:22:00.648
I was the one who told her
that Clara was dead.

1:22:00.650 --> 1:22:02.349
Poor thing.

1:22:02.351 --> 1:22:05.920
Where's Melissa now?

1:22:05.922 --> 1:22:07.421
I've been trying her.

1:22:07.423 --> 1:22:09.490
At a girlfriend's.

1:22:09.492 --> 1:22:12.993
Uh, Heather something.

1:22:12.995 --> 1:22:18.265
Grab me a towel, and I'll get
dressed and show you.

1:22:36.484 --> 1:22:39.520
Help me out.
It's slippery.

1:22:47.662 --> 1:22:50.030
Woman:
<i> A rose.</i>

1:23:05.714 --> 1:23:07.648
I'll be down the hall.

1:23:07.650 --> 1:23:09.116
Okay.

1:23:18.393 --> 1:23:20.561
Johnson, my cousin's
here, back room.

1:23:20.563 --> 1:23:22.029
Watch the fire escape.

1:23:22.031 --> 1:23:24.732
-Just arrest her.
-I can't.

1:23:24.734 --> 1:23:26.300
They've got Melissa.

1:23:31.506 --> 1:23:33.273
Wow.

1:23:33.275 --> 1:23:38.178
This looks like -- I don't
know -- some kind of puzzle.

1:23:38.180 --> 1:23:41.582
I remember.
You like puzzles.

1:23:43.551 --> 1:23:45.019
Want to ride over
with me?

1:23:45.021 --> 1:23:47.254
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't,

1:23:47.256 --> 1:23:49.023
but I'll be happy
to draw you a map.

1:23:49.025 --> 1:23:50.624
I know exactly
where she is.

1:24:12.580 --> 1:24:15.082
I got to use the bathroom.

1:24:15.084 --> 1:24:18.719
Don't forget to put
the toilet seat down.

1:25:15.543 --> 1:25:19.279
Johnson! Eli morrison.
She's out here on foot.

1:25:19.281 --> 1:25:21.115
I got her car keys, wallet,
and cellphone.

1:25:21.117 --> 1:25:23.117
Let me know when you have her.
-Where you going?

1:25:23.119 --> 1:25:25.219
I'm going to find Melissa.

1:25:25.221 --> 1:25:26.386
Johnson!

1:25:26.388 --> 1:25:28.822
Mr. Johnson!
-Hey!

1:25:28.824 --> 1:25:30.824
Someone stole your car!

1:25:32.460 --> 1:25:35.195
Doyle: Tony.
Did you get my message?

1:25:35.197 --> 1:25:38.198
Tony: Yeah, brother.
I'm here and so is he.

1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:40.234
Should we wait for the cops?
-No.

1:25:40.236 --> 1:25:41.668
We can handle this.

1:25:49.878 --> 1:25:51.812
-He's up there!
-You okay?

1:25:51.814 --> 1:25:53.380
Yeah.

1:25:53.382 --> 1:25:55.916
Listen, I want you
to head up that side.

1:25:55.918 --> 1:25:58.752
I'm gonna draw his fire
over here. Come on.

1:26:04.526 --> 1:26:06.160
Perry!

1:26:09.565 --> 1:26:11.532
I'm not here to fight!

1:26:16.405 --> 1:26:18.739
Okay, go!

1:26:26.514 --> 1:26:28.315
I have a message
from your mother!

1:26:28.317 --> 1:26:29.850
I saw her today!

1:26:29.852 --> 1:26:31.752
She told me a story!

1:26:31.754 --> 1:26:34.454
You think you know the story,
but you don't!

1:26:34.456 --> 1:26:39.293
It all ends here!
No more lies!

1:26:59.781 --> 1:27:01.882
-Okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:27:05.386 --> 1:27:07.387
Just in case.

1:27:07.389 --> 1:27:11.525
If they catch you,
they will kill you.

1:27:11.527 --> 1:27:13.260
At the end of the pond.

1:27:13.262 --> 1:27:14.928
Second you get service,
call the police.

1:27:14.930 --> 1:27:16.430
-Okay.
-Go!

1:28:48.090 --> 1:28:49.990
Hey! Hey!

1:28:49.992 --> 1:28:52.526
Oh!

1:29:55.690 --> 1:29:57.858
Perry!

1:30:23.918 --> 1:30:27.788
Your mother tried to make me
promise I wouldn't hurt you.

1:30:27.790 --> 1:30:30.757
I couldn't make
that promise!

1:30:30.759 --> 1:30:33.860
I got your girlfriend!
If you move, I'll kill you.

1:30:33.862 --> 1:30:35.429
Drop your gun.

1:30:36.731 --> 1:30:37.798
Drop it!

1:30:57.986 --> 1:31:00.187
Where is she?

1:31:00.189 --> 1:31:01.922
You're gonna watch her die

1:31:01.924 --> 1:31:05.725
like you watched my father die
when you stabbed him.

1:31:11.766 --> 1:31:13.934
It's my name
you're spelling.

1:31:13.936 --> 1:31:15.802
Carve it on me!

1:31:15.804 --> 1:31:17.070
Don't move!

1:31:17.072 --> 1:31:18.772
My father didn't
kill your father.

1:31:18.774 --> 1:31:20.006
Your mother did.
She told me!

1:31:20.008 --> 1:31:21.208
Liar!

1:31:21.210 --> 1:31:22.242
She wanted you
to know the truth!

1:31:22.244 --> 1:31:24.211
-Liar!
-Hey!

1:31:26.814 --> 1:31:28.482
No!

1:31:56.878 --> 1:31:58.512
Listen.

1:32:15.530 --> 1:32:18.298
No. No.

1:32:20.635 --> 1:32:23.637
No. No.

1:32:26.874 --> 1:32:28.308
No.

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:34.781
It's melting.

1:32:37.719 --> 1:32:39.686
What is?

1:32:39.688 --> 1:32:41.588
What is?

1:32:45.894 --> 1:32:48.094
Everything.

1:32:53.134 --> 1:32:55.835
I see him.

1:32:55.837 --> 1:32:58.838
No. No.

1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:02.676
Yes.

1:33:02.678 --> 1:33:05.345
Yes.

1:33:38.079 --> 1:33:39.613
Do it.

1:33:41.215 --> 1:33:43.383
Do it.

1:33:49.223 --> 1:33:51.791
Do it.

1:34:13.014 --> 1:34:15.348
I can't.

1:34:23.891 --> 1:34:25.959
He's my brother.

1:34:33.100 --> 1:34:36.870
You're my brother.

1:34:39.407 --> 1:34:42.208
It's true.

1:34:42.210 --> 1:34:45.845
Your mother told me
today in church.

1:34:47.782 --> 1:34:50.884
You're my father's other son.

1:36:04.492 --> 1:36:07.927
Melissa: Clara wanted her ashes
to be scattered in the sea,

1:36:07.929 --> 1:36:11.364
but she also wanted a grave
in the ground

1:36:11.366 --> 1:36:14.000
to share with friends.

1:36:14.002 --> 1:36:16.536
So, let us all put something in,

1:36:16.538 --> 1:36:20.507
something...Something that we
need to let go of

1:36:20.509 --> 1:36:24.811
so that we can start
a new beginning.

1:36:24.813 --> 1:36:27.313
Just like she has.

1:36:51.972 --> 1:36:56.442
Billy:
Okay, let's all raise a glass
to our favorite Irish lass,

1:36:56.444 --> 1:36:59.979
and we'll toast to the sweetest
girl that ever lived.

1:36:59.981 --> 1:37:02.048
Let's get out of here.

1:37:18.399 --> 1:37:21.267
If you're around, Maggie...

1:37:23.871 --> 1:37:26.506
...pay me a visit.

1:37:36.517 --> 1:37:38.585
A long one.

1:37:44.491 --> 1:37:47.393
I brought death
to this island.

1:37:47.395 --> 1:37:49.195
I'm sorry.

1:37:49.197 --> 1:37:51.164
I know you are.

1:37:51.166 --> 1:37:55.602
Do you think
you can forgive me?

1:37:55.604 --> 1:37:57.403
I can.

1:37:57.405 --> 1:37:59.072
I do.

1:38:01.909 --> 1:38:04.510
I have something
for you.

1:38:05.913 --> 1:38:08.581
This is your father's
old camera.

1:38:08.583 --> 1:38:13.086
There's film in it.

1:38:13.088 --> 1:38:16.556
I think it's time you got
to know him.

1:38:16.558 --> 1:38:18.925
So I can see
what he was like?

1:38:18.927 --> 1:38:24.130
Oh, he was happy.

1:38:24.132 --> 1:38:27.400
We all were.

1:38:37.044 --> 1:38:39.445
So, where do you go
from here?

1:38:42.150 --> 1:38:44.918
Home.

1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:48.554
I became a cop because of what
i thought my father did.

1:38:48.556 --> 1:38:52.158
Wanted to even things.

1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:55.695
Turns out
i didn't have to.

1:38:55.697 --> 1:39:00.633
Well, you're free now.
You can do whatever you want.

1:39:00.635 --> 1:39:05.438
When Eli was dying
out there,

1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:09.042
what did you say to her?

1:39:11.245 --> 1:39:15.281
I said a prayer.

1:39:15.283 --> 1:39:17.317
I didn't want to kill her.

1:39:17.319 --> 1:39:20.119
I know.
You did it for me.

1:39:23.123 --> 1:39:25.058
I'm sorry.

1:39:27.161 --> 1:39:29.329
You should come back here.

1:39:31.332 --> 1:39:33.499
I'm gonna miss you.

1:39:33.501 --> 1:39:37.370
Tell you what.
If you want to come back,

1:39:37.372 --> 1:39:39.572
you toss this penny
over the ferry

1:39:39.574 --> 1:39:42.608
over at that light house
by brant point.

1:39:42.610 --> 1:39:45.244
It's good luck.

1:40:11.106 --> 1:40:12.572
Turn around.

1:40:25.286 --> 1:40:28.454
Well done, Mr. Doyle.

1:40:28.456 --> 1:40:30.523
Sorry for doubting you.

1:40:30.525 --> 1:40:32.392
At times,
i doubted myself.

1:40:32.394 --> 1:40:34.127
Good luck.

1:40:34.129 --> 1:40:35.561
Thank you.

1:40:40.535 --> 1:40:42.468
Couldn't have done it
without you, brother.

1:40:42.470 --> 1:40:44.270
Thank you.

1:40:44.272 --> 1:40:46.506
You know you got a little
something on your face there?

1:40:46.508 --> 1:40:47.774
What's that,
a little dirt?

1:40:47.776 --> 1:40:50.510
No, it's a smile.

1:40:50.512 --> 1:40:52.445
Be well.

1:40:52.447 --> 1:40:54.247
Now what?

1:40:54.249 --> 1:40:57.617
Onward.

1:41:14.069 --> 1:41:15.601
Man: Okay, here we go.

1:41:15.603 --> 1:41:18.671
A penny for you, a penny
for you, and one for you.

1:41:18.673 --> 1:41:20.673
Remember, guys, wait until
we pass the lighthouse

1:41:20.675 --> 1:41:22.208
before you throw them.

1:41:33.421 --> 1:41:35.388
Come on, Jimmy!
Come on!

1:41:35.390 --> 1:41:38.357
We're gonna miss it!
-Come on, Beth.

1:41:38.359 --> 1:41:41.494
Take my hand.

1:41:41.496 --> 1:41:43.329
Hurry, hurry.

1:41:43.331 --> 1:41:45.531
Woman:
Jimmy, Beth, come on.

1:41:45.533 --> 1:41:48.367
Here's a penny for you
and one for you,

1:41:48.369 --> 1:41:51.370
and remember, you guys, wait
until we pass the lighthouse.

1:41:51.372 --> 1:41:53.873
-Come on, get her a penny.
-Come on, for what?

1:41:53.875 --> 1:41:55.741
All right, when you see
the lighthouse, make a wish.

1:41:55.743 --> 1:41:57.844
Woman:
Make a wish we come back.

1:41:57.846 --> 1:41:59.612
-Kids.
-Throw it over!

1:41:59.614 --> 1:42:02.782
-Say goodbye to the coast guard.
-Bye, coast guard!

1:42:02.784 --> 1:42:05.485
Bye!
-Goodbye, nantucket.

1:42:05.487 --> 1:42:08.554
Bye!
-Bye, nantucket.

1:42:08.556 --> 1:42:11.657
I love you!
