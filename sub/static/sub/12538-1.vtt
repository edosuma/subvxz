Welcome to Carolina's, sir.

03:55.285 --> 03:56.685
Bring me another.

03:57.230 --> 03:58.269
Rough day?

03:58.386 --> 04:00.808
You have no idea
the jerk-offs I have to deal with.

04:01.253 --> 04:03.112
Story of my life.

04:03.307 --> 04:04.707
You're new here, right?

04:06.597 --> 04:07.997
First week.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.999
Why don't ya have one with me?

04:23.742 --> 04:24.742
(Sighs)

04:24.743 --> 04:26.166
You're beautiful, you know that?

04:29.992 --> 04:31.392
Let's get outta here.

04:33.132 --> 04:34.532
I'll get fired.

04:36.506 --> 04:37.906
I'll give you a job.

04:38.276 --> 04:39.676
What do you do?

04:41.235 --> 04:42.635
Data collection.

04:43.671 --> 04:45.071
Sounds thrilling.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.100
I should get back to work.

04:58.850 --> 05:00.250
Good night guys.

05:12.416 --> 05:13.500
Aw!

05:13.528 --> 05:15.983
- Don't pull this shit on me!
- Listen, I'm paying your ass!

05:16.013 --> 05:18.148
- You're too wired!
- Hey, what's goin' on?

05:21.134 --> 05:22.534
We're OK.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.160
It's nothin'.

05:24.184 --> 05:26.355
- Yeah, you alright?
- Back off honey!

05:26.785 --> 05:28.285
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

05:28.535 --> 05:30.091
OK. I'm sorry, OK.
I'll behave...

05:30.857 --> 05:32.357
I promise.

05:32.607 --> 05:34.177
Come on.
Let's just get outta here.

05:54.359 --> 05:55.916
- I made contact.
- OK.

05:56.036 --> 05:59.312
He paid for his bill with a company card,
"Excelsior Intelligence".

06:00.397 --> 06:01.797
And what's he like?

06:02.334 --> 06:03.734
He's a piece of work...

06:03.885 --> 06:06.306
One minute he's doing his whole
boyish charming thing

06:06.336 --> 06:08.781
and the next he's got his hands
around some girl's neck.

06:09.774 --> 06:11.174
Anything on the trafficking?

06:11.532 --> 06:13.621
This guy's not running hookers,
he's using them.

06:14.563 --> 06:15.763
Go on.

06:15.788 --> 06:18.064
Well most of the men in that place
are screwing hookers,

06:18.153 --> 06:19.557
but Cheat's not supplying them.

06:19.669 --> 06:22.069
So if he's not, then why
are we even investigating him?

06:23.387 --> 06:25.143
Sarah, honey, I know what you know.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.131
(Sighs)

06:41.293 --> 06:42.500
(Pats on her leg)

06:42.520 --> 06:43.920
- You OK?
- Yeah.

06:52.115 --> 06:53.515
This...

06:54.044 --> 06:55.964
This is a $20 club sandwich.

06:56.614 --> 06:58.732
- What?
- You believe that? Twenty bucks.

07:00.344 --> 07:02.415
- You want half?
- Hell yeah!

07:02.416 --> 07:03.893
(Chuckles)

07:04.529 --> 07:05.929
That's ten bucks.

07:05.930 --> 07:07.100
(Laughs)

07:07.183 --> 07:09.326
- Serious.
- OK, here we go.

07:09.327 --> 07:10.327
All right.

07:12.724 --> 07:13.724
Mmmh.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.125
Alright. I get it.

07:15.232 --> 07:17.057
- Am I right?
- This is so good!

07:17.347 --> 07:18.747
Did you pay for it?

07:19.946 --> 07:21.537
Job's gotta have some perks, right?

07:21.884 --> 07:23.284
Yeah.

07:23.482 --> 07:24.882
This your first time?

07:25.324 --> 07:26.724
Being a handler?

07:26.800 --> 07:29.532
Oh my God, is it that obvious?

07:29.533 --> 07:31.204
(Chuckles)
No.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.691
You're doin' good.

07:33.827 --> 07:36.011
You know it's nice
having a female handler.

07:36.742 --> 07:39.009
At least I know you're
not trying to fuck me, right?

07:39.978 --> 07:41.802
Yeah. I have been there.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.775
Boy.

07:49.383 --> 07:50.783
You married?

07:50.784 --> 07:52.206
Uh-huh.

07:52.944 --> 07:54.344
Kids?

07:54.754 --> 07:56.154
- Two.
- Damn!

07:57.362 --> 07:58.762
How do you keep it goin'?

08:00.690 --> 08:03.979
I mean you, you look like you even got
your shit together, so that's great.

08:07.437 --> 08:09.126
You ever think about goin' back under?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.157
No.

08:20.168 --> 08:21.568
Grace, you gotta tell me.

08:25.869 --> 08:27.269
Tell you what?

08:28.005 --> 08:29.605
What's really goin' on here?

08:39.611 --> 08:41.000
(Computer beeping)

08:41.017 --> 08:42.479
- Hello, sir!
- Hi!

08:45.345 --> 08:48.152
(Indistinct conversations)

08:49.885 --> 08:51.285
Hi, Don.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.749
Miss Michelle.

08:52.779 --> 08:55.196
There he is.
Ray?

09:00.122 --> 09:01.522
You gonna watch this?

09:22.060 --> 09:23.460
Blake Silver.

09:24.121 --> 09:26.935
- Excuse me?
- Your VP of sales, he's your first problem.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.675
And you are?

09:28.729 --> 09:30.129
He's not happy.

09:30.346 --> 09:33.146
It could either be the falling price
of your stock options or...

09:33.346 --> 09:35.435
maybe he thinks he should be
Senior VP by now.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.151
Either way...

09:37.175 --> 09:40.940
every Friday night he blows off steam
at a place called Caroline's.

09:40.943 --> 09:42.739
He parks with the valet.

09:42.769 --> 09:45.558
Spends a few hundred on drinks,
a few thousand on strippers.

09:46.057 --> 09:48.141
Mostly on a blonde
by the name of Candy.

09:48.837 --> 09:53.492
Candy's got this dazzling white smile
and a BA in biology from Santa Cruz.

09:53.561 --> 09:55.295
And while Blake's in the VIP room...

09:55.604 --> 09:57.004
MRP...

09:57.365 --> 09:59.413
Your competitors, Mr. Milton.

09:59.901 --> 10:01.301
They're paying off the valets.

10:02.709 --> 10:05.053
And taking photographs
of your R and D files.

10:05.581 --> 10:06.995
Here, take a look.

10:07.275 --> 10:09.597
We did it ourselves just to
show you how easy it is.

10:12.049 --> 10:15.000
Johnny, can I have what
he's having please? Thank you.

10:16.668 --> 10:18.322
- Think he's gonna bite?
- Oh,

10:18.614 --> 10:21.028
Phillip Durden.
Well, he's your night security watchman.

10:21.067 --> 10:23.305
He spends about 6-8 minutes
patrolling your premises and

10:23.335 --> 10:25.428
6-8 hours trolling for porn.

10:25.752 --> 10:27.609
You see, Phil is getting off...

10:27.895 --> 10:31.082
but your competitors, well...
they're getting in.

10:33.665 --> 10:35.065
Who are you?

10:37.244 --> 10:39.489
Ethan Kelly.
Here's my card.

10:42.902 --> 10:45.039
You like this place?
This club?

10:45.107 --> 10:48.051
We do all the security for it.
Vetted their employees...

10:48.081 --> 10:50.098
It's just one of the
many things that we do.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.123
We like to look after people.

10:52.538 --> 10:54.126
People like yourself.

10:54.931 --> 10:57.554
That Mickey Mouse security team
that you have on retainer...

10:57.652 --> 10:58.852
they got lazy.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.616
You're leaking like a sieve.

11:01.077 --> 11:04.355
You hire my company
and we'll plug those holes.

11:07.324 --> 11:08.724
Thanks for the drink.

11:43.334 --> 11:44.734
Come on.

11:56.609 --> 11:58.987
(Phone ringing)
(Laughs)

12:02.156 --> 12:03.556
I knew this would work!

12:06.821 --> 12:08.873
- Hey, Tommy.
- Good mornin', ma'am.

12:17.934 --> 12:19.787
- Hey!
- Hey.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.824
So, Sarah made contact...

12:23.278 --> 12:26.553
and our target, Danny Chechowski,

12:26.583 --> 12:28.374
also known as, Cheat,

12:28.500 --> 12:32.328
turns out he started up a company
with three of his buddies...

12:32.358 --> 12:35.827
some kind of corporate security,
"Excelsior Intelligence".

12:36.179 --> 12:38.631
The other partners, Ethan Kelly,

12:38.661 --> 12:40.592
this guy Ray Williams, and

12:40.622 --> 12:43.191
Brian Cacelle, AKA Spud.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.100
So these guys all served in
Afghanistan, seven years,

12:46.167 --> 12:48.530
- multiple deployments.
- Is that where they met?

12:48.560 --> 12:51.123
Uh, they were never in the same unit...

12:51.603 --> 12:53.381
So this guy Cacelle, he's got...

12:53.411 --> 12:55.038
a wife and a baby.

12:55.068 --> 12:56.978
Ray Williams, two daughters.

12:57.607 --> 13:00.497
Ethan Kelly, like Chechowski,
never married.

13:01.104 --> 13:04.044
So for the last four years,
tax returns have them employed

13:04.074 --> 13:06.707
- at a company called, Blue Vine.
- Private security?

13:07.097 --> 13:09.021
Well we don't know yet, but...

13:09.233 --> 13:11.795
yeah, it's a possibility. Or...

13:11.825 --> 13:14.290
Blue Vine is a cover for a drugs ring.

13:14.617 --> 13:18.151
I mean these guys spent the last
four years, in and out of the country

13:18.281 --> 13:19.940
on extended visits to the Middle East

13:19.982 --> 13:22.785
Islamabad, Dubai.
Then twelve months ago

13:22.910 --> 13:24.601
they come home for good...

13:24.631 --> 13:26.147
via Amsterdam.

13:29.682 --> 13:31.082
This is good work.

13:35.706 --> 13:38.249
- Is that it?
- You want a gold star?

13:41.089 --> 13:42.666
Sarah's not happy.

13:42.796 --> 13:44.857
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.283
She thinks she's being lied to.

13:49.402 --> 13:52.158
We're not investigating Chechowski
for running hookers, are we?

13:52.253 --> 13:53.653
Come on.

13:54.090 --> 13:57.154
If you're endangering my agent
by not giving me the full facts,

13:57.184 --> 13:58.961
I don't know if I want to do this.

13:58.991 --> 14:01.902
Grace, I want you to get Sarah
into Cheat's apartment.

14:02.663 --> 14:04.191
We need it bugged.

14:16.041 --> 14:19.210
Sarah's not happy?
You're her handler.

14:19.431 --> 14:20.831
Handle her.

14:28.967 --> 14:30.413
(Hammering)

14:33.295 --> 14:35.189
And I have to report to her?

14:37.351 --> 14:40.185
- I think it's dead.
- And she looks like this fuckin'

14:40.387 --> 14:42.391
Fox News reject.
You know?

14:42.392 --> 14:42.960
(Laughs)

14:42.967 --> 14:45.638
- No really! It's not funny.
- No, it's not... I'm not laughing.

14:45.728 --> 14:47.530
She's just this bureaucrat.

14:48.058 --> 14:49.872
She's a bureaucrat and, and

14:49.902 --> 14:52.972
she's going to tell me how to do my job?
From behind her desk?

14:53.058 --> 14:56.578
How long is this assignment going to
go on for, right? You'll get through it!

14:57.227 --> 14:59.285
- This friend of mine...
- The barista?

14:59.315 --> 15:00.593
Yeah, the barista.

15:00.623 --> 15:02.726
She posts online
making fun of her boss...

15:02.898 --> 15:05.296
This-a, chicken, by the way, really good.
Very tender.

15:05.351 --> 15:07.874
- It's cause his breath stinks!
- Halitosis, but that's disgusting!

15:07.929 --> 15:09.634
Yes. But she totally forgets...

15:09.664 --> 15:12.403
- and she just friended him
online the week before. - Oh, boy!

15:12.433 --> 15:14.364
So he reads the post,
next thing he comes in,

15:14.365 --> 15:16.884
walks right up to her
and he just like...

15:17.957 --> 15:18.618
(Grunts)

15:18.619 --> 15:21.358
- You're fired!
- That is disgusting.

15:26.411 --> 15:27.811
What?

15:27.939 --> 15:29.256
- Nothing!
- Nothing.

15:29.286 --> 15:30.686
I saw that...

15:30.856 --> 15:32.353
- What's going on?
- What?

15:32.615 --> 15:34.404
What are you two conspiring about?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.306
- Nothing...
- It's nothing really! Nothing.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.658
- No, tell me!
- It's nothing, it's just some...

15:41.039 --> 15:42.439
Shelley's pregnant.

16:17.548 --> 16:18.948
How long?

16:20.096 --> 16:21.496
Three months.

16:22.821 --> 16:24.067
Was it planned?

16:24.097 --> 16:26.362
Grace, now, come on it...

16:27.501 --> 16:29.190
Whoa! No, no, no.
Where are you going?

16:29.316 --> 16:30.967
- My room.
- No, come on...

16:30.997 --> 16:33.601
You're part of this family...
Sit down!

16:36.898 --> 16:38.098
Did you know?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.929
I asked her not to say anything.

16:39.952 --> 16:41.152
Was it planned?

16:41.176 --> 16:42.859
- Does it make any difference?
- Tom?

16:42.860 --> 16:45.260
- It doesn't make any difference.
- How could you do that?

16:45.262 --> 16:47.169
- How could I do what?
- It's okay.

16:49.223 --> 16:51.436
How is it so easy for you?

16:53.789 --> 16:56.944
Grace, none of this is easy for me.

16:58.298 --> 17:00.184
And I am not trying to replace Sam.

17:21.847 --> 17:23.247
Well...

17:23.945 --> 17:26.095
I wish that had gone better.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.467
Yeah, me too.

17:30.965 --> 17:32.710
(Sighs)
I gotta get home.

17:33.466 --> 17:35.689
- OK.
- I'll see you Saturday, alright?

17:37.791 --> 17:39.191
I love you.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.008
(Sniffs)

17:55.273 --> 17:57.551
(Crying)

18:05.804 --> 18:07.676
(Footsteps approaching)

18:13.705 --> 18:14.953
(Sighs)

18:25.323 --> 18:26.890
Where do they want these?

18:28.880 --> 18:30.723
Cheat's place.

18:31.828 --> 18:33.804
Which means they want me to fuck him.

18:34.052 --> 18:36.522
- I did not say that.
- No.

18:36.552 --> 18:40.573
So what, I show up to his place, knock on
his door, and bring him a piece of pie?

18:40.687 --> 18:42.390
And talk to him about
his addiction to blow

18:42.424 --> 18:45.235
and his thing for strangling hookers?
Yeah, that's gonna work!

18:47.013 --> 18:48.541
It means they want me to fuck him.

18:50.127 --> 18:51.527
You know...
Shit...

18:51.923 --> 18:53.532
I always think this shit's
going to be different.

18:53.563 --> 18:57.306
- Look, every UC has their line.
- Yeah, what's yours?

18:58.693 --> 18:59.864
You think they ask
the guys to go down

18:59.865 --> 19:02.455
on some fat fuck just
to deepen their cover?

19:03.346 --> 19:04.346
(Sighs)

19:04.347 --> 19:07.010
Somehow I thought having a female handler
was going to be better.

19:07.049 --> 19:09.714
- Then just say no!
- I can't! I already have two strikes...

19:09.886 --> 19:12.927
- Wait, what do you mean?
- Like you give a fuck!?

19:13.289 --> 19:15.606
You know what?
Just do your job.

19:16.562 --> 19:18.822
Yeah, alright. You know,
I gotta go feed my dog.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.578
- Sarah, come on! Sarah!
- I gotta go!

19:20.613 --> 19:22.539
- All right, then, forget it.
- Come on!

19:22.574 --> 19:23.829
No, I gotta go.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.884
Sarah!

19:27.654 --> 19:28.558
(Starts engine)

19:28.559 --> 19:32.734
(Tires screeching)

19:34.728 --> 19:36.482
(Tires screeching)

19:41.172 --> 19:42.572
Hey, look at this.

19:50.305 --> 19:51.725
It's from the other night.

19:57.336 --> 19:59.229
Man, he's out of control.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.330
I'll talk to him.

20:09.089 --> 20:10.089
(Indistinct conversation)

20:10.090 --> 20:12.374
- You gentlemen doing alright?
- Hey!

20:12.701 --> 20:14.373
A whole lot better now that
you're here baby.

20:14.444 --> 20:16.744
Look, bring us two bottles of champagne.

20:17.518 --> 20:19.406
You know what?
Fuck it, make it three.

20:20.646 --> 20:22.575
- We're going to party tonight...
- Make it two.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.539
You didn't call it man.
You gotta call the shot, it doesn't count.

20:24.564 --> 20:26.414
Aw, come on Ray,
would you stop with this shit?

20:26.453 --> 20:28.626
Hey, actually, I saw it.
He called it.

20:28.876 --> 20:30.899
- You were chalking your tip.
- Yeah, I'll chalk your fuckin' tip.

20:30.946 --> 20:33.758
- You're gonna chalk my tip? What does
that mean? - Get away from the table.

20:33.813 --> 20:36.100
- Step away!
- Whoa, no. I'm good, I'm good.

20:36.185 --> 20:37.874
Come on man, you never party any more.

20:38.555 --> 20:39.955
Come on, relax.

20:39.980 --> 20:41.543
Look, it's been long enough.

20:41.801 --> 20:44.699
- Let's cherish this sweet life baby...
- I'm relaxed, and I'm cherishin' it, no...

20:44.763 --> 20:46.263
I'm fine thanks.

20:48.329 --> 20:50.829
Oh! Champagne!

20:55.459 --> 20:56.959
- How you doin' babe?
- Good.

20:57.209 --> 20:58.709
I like your hair like that...

21:01.271 --> 21:03.800
(Bottles pop)

21:03.813 --> 21:05.200
Alright ladies!

21:05.871 --> 21:07.371
Here we go.

21:07.982 --> 21:09.839
(Laughs)

21:09.985 --> 21:12.994
- Alright. To us.
- To our blessings.

21:15.052 --> 21:16.020
(Speaks in foreign language)

21:16.022 --> 21:17.922
Oh, now he speaks Arabic.

21:19.650 --> 21:21.351
(Laughs)

21:25.010 --> 21:27.136
The fuck that's supposed to mean?

21:27.986 --> 21:30.086
It's just a joke man.
It just came out.

21:30.684 --> 21:32.284
Just a joke.

21:34.267 --> 21:35.992
You don't think I feel
bad about that shit?

21:35.993 --> 21:37.895
I didn't mean
anything by it. OK?

21:37.914 --> 21:40.848
I'm just trying to live my life
and you're dwelling on that shit?

21:41.684 --> 21:43.884
Blaming me?
Is that it?

21:46.143 --> 21:49.121
- Answer me, motherfucker!
- Whoa, let's take it down, take it down...

21:52.217 --> 21:53.417
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

21:53.576 --> 21:56.134
- Fuck me?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa... Ray, Ray.

21:56.766 --> 21:58.266
Cool it.
Right?

22:14.584 --> 22:17.084
So, how'd you get a name like Cheat?

22:18.547 --> 22:20.447
It's 'cause I'm so God damn honest.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.200
Hey!

22:28.583 --> 22:30.083
You remember Asmar?

22:31.230 --> 22:32.430
Fuckin' Asmar...

22:32.480 --> 22:35.147
- Sucks your Asmar!
- So we're in this little shitty village...

22:35.350 --> 22:38.920
I mean... pinned down behind this road,
just getting the shit kicked out of us...

22:39.076 --> 22:41.130
We got bullets flying...
RPGs...

22:41.380 --> 22:42.880
So night fall hits.

22:43.130 --> 22:45.512
You know, I start moving the
boys out and naturally,

22:45.770 --> 22:49.819
Ray, Spud and I start looking at
each other and that guy right there...

22:50.578 --> 22:52.078
nowhere in sight.

22:52.385 --> 22:54.685
- This fucker's gone AWOL.
- Again!

22:54.895 --> 22:56.857
So, we start looking
around for our buddy...

22:56.882 --> 22:58.285
And we find him, he's a...

22:58.336 --> 23:01.685
crouched behind some, shit hole-mud hut,
cigarette hanging out.

23:01.935 --> 23:04.869
Got his beats on. Just sitting
there like this, a head bobbin'.

23:04.985 --> 23:07.985
I grab his lazy ass out of there,
pull off his fuckin'

23:08.035 --> 23:10.702
- douchbag headphones.
- What do you think he's listening to?

23:10.885 --> 23:14.785
- It doesn't matter... - Big fucking Joel,
he's listening to Billie God damn Joel!

23:14.883 --> 23:16.677
What are you laughin' at?
Huh?

23:16.772 --> 23:18.472
- You listen to Cats motherfucker!
- Hey,

23:18.614 --> 23:20.014
Cats is a great musical!

23:20.064 --> 23:21.564
We all know how it goes.

23:21.814 --> 23:23.314
We all know the song!

23:23.315 --> 23:26.150
(Singing)

23:26.157 --> 23:27.957
Alright! Alright, we get it!
We get it.

23:28.004 --> 23:30.551
Oh, you having fun?

23:30.586 --> 23:32.303
(They continue singing)

23:32.904 --> 23:34.504
That's it, enough!

23:34.505 --> 23:38.196
(Singing continues)

23:59.852 --> 24:01.652
Evie! I got pizza!

24:01.653 --> 24:03.776
Uh, shit.

24:03.777 --> 24:06.989
(Indistinct conversations)

24:17.645 --> 24:18.845
Mom.

24:19.258 --> 24:20.758
Hi, honey.

24:21.744 --> 24:24.344
What happened to your hair?
You took out the weave.

24:26.793 --> 24:28.193
I like it!

24:29.118 --> 24:30.718
So natural.

24:31.875 --> 24:35.618
I found that dress in a flea market in
Santa Fe and I just had to buy it for her.

24:35.886 --> 24:37.286
Fits her like a glove.

24:37.836 --> 24:39.347
I mean the bra has to go.

24:39.444 --> 24:41.968
Grandma!
I'm not wearing this without a bra.

24:42.018 --> 24:43.946
With a body like that?

24:44.027 --> 24:47.818
- Wine, mom? Really.
- Oh, I insisted. Can't drink alone.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.168
Look me in the eyes sweetheart.

24:52.818 --> 24:54.685
Grace, you need to
teach her these things.

24:55.068 --> 24:56.668
Thank you.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.240
Mom!

24:59.073 --> 25:00.573
Spoil sport.

25:02.018 --> 25:04.094
Marty's taught me so much about wine.

25:04.219 --> 25:05.859
- He's a real drinker.
- Oh, yeah...

25:05.943 --> 25:08.742
Not that way.
Classy.

25:08.804 --> 25:12.335
- Oh, it's Marty now, is it?
- So direct.

25:12.491 --> 25:14.411
Something I've always loved about you.

25:15.968 --> 25:17.368
Hi!

25:25.623 --> 25:27.354
(Laughs)

25:27.993 --> 25:29.850
- What?
- What? What do you mean what?

25:29.900 --> 25:32.204
You know what.
You can't do that shit around here.

25:33.050 --> 25:34.734
What is your problem Ray?

25:34.859 --> 25:37.741
Saw it on the cameras man,
putting your hands up, all over Kendra?

25:37.812 --> 25:40.520
What the fuck you thinking?
This is where we do business.

25:40.885 --> 25:42.441
Why you always up in my grill, man?

25:42.800 --> 25:44.300
You're bringin' me down.

25:44.550 --> 25:46.050
Does he bring you guys down?

25:47.279 --> 25:49.443
Dude you could bring down
a house party on helium, motherfucker!

25:49.498 --> 25:50.750
Hey, Cheat?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.223
It's not a bad thing to
pull it back a little bit.

25:54.021 --> 25:55.849
We actually do give a shit about you.

25:55.850 --> 25:56.850
Oh.

25:56.896 --> 25:58.700
I give a shit about you guys too.

26:00.432 --> 26:01.832
You too, dick-wad.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.000
Hey sugar tits!

26:17.001 --> 26:18.576
(Sighs)

26:21.217 --> 26:22.417
I'll make up the bed.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.250
- I'll move the boxes.
- No!

26:24.500 --> 26:26.000
Don't.

26:26.050 --> 26:27.550
Don't touch them.

26:27.626 --> 26:28.826
Honey, let me help you.

26:28.850 --> 26:31.050
Don't. Touch. Them.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.700
OK, OK.

26:47.980 --> 26:49.275
Hey...

26:49.677 --> 26:52.249
- What are you guys celebrating?
- Ah, nothin'.

26:52.499 --> 26:53.899
Didn't sound like nothing.

26:54.049 --> 26:55.948
We won a big contract.
That's all...

26:56.990 --> 26:58.583
Oh, you work with those guys?

27:03.804 --> 27:05.304
I'd die for those guys.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.212
Listen....
Um...

27:10.411 --> 27:13.340
I'm sorry about the other night.
You know. With the girl.

27:14.839 --> 27:16.239
It's none of my business.

27:16.972 --> 27:19.150
I know, but I can be a
real dick sometimes, so...

27:19.352 --> 27:20.852
I'm sorry.

27:21.134 --> 27:22.634
We all can.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.426
Hey...
Um...

27:25.824 --> 27:27.106
Well maybe...

27:27.316 --> 27:29.628
get outta here and go grab
a drink when you get off?

27:36.191 --> 27:38.284
I don't think I'd be very
good company tonight.

27:38.387 --> 27:39.887
I find that hard to believe.

27:40.722 --> 27:43.349
Come on. We go grab a drink,
maybe you can tell me about it.

27:47.395 --> 27:48.795
I get it.

27:49.517 --> 27:51.384
You don't want to go home with a dickhead.

27:52.244 --> 27:53.644
I wouldn't either.

27:54.949 --> 27:56.349
Good night.

27:57.599 --> 27:58.999
Good night.

28:03.803 --> 28:06.841
I was so disappointed I couldn't
make it up here for the funeral.

28:06.942 --> 28:09.277
- Yeah, we got your flowers.
- Yeah, I wanted to come

28:09.324 --> 28:11.074
but I wasn't sure I'd be welcome.

28:11.621 --> 28:13.068
He was your grandson.

28:13.069 --> 28:15.280
And you didn't call,
I had to hear it from Tom.

28:15.285 --> 28:18.049
- Did you ever call me?
- Honey, I understand.

28:19.374 --> 28:22.449
- How could you possibly understand?
- I wanna help you move on.

28:23.899 --> 28:25.499
What? Now?

28:26.177 --> 28:30.199
- Don't get angry.
- Oh, no. No, no!

28:30.649 --> 28:32.049
Hey!

28:32.716 --> 28:36.696
You don't get to show up here and suddenly
be a mother just because you feel like it.

28:36.891 --> 28:38.518
You don't get to help me move on.

28:38.614 --> 28:40.457
I've been through this too you know.

28:40.825 --> 28:42.918
Your father died and I had to move on.

28:43.027 --> 28:45.495
You moved on a long time before dad died.

28:45.597 --> 28:47.097
That's grief talking.

28:58.547 --> 29:00.758
(Birds chipping)

29:02.614 --> 29:03.540
(Dog barking)

29:03.544 --> 29:05.300
SARAH: Which means
they want me to fuck him.

29:05.850 --> 29:07.950
GRACE: I did not say that.

29:18.515 --> 29:20.290
(Sighs)

29:22.000 --> 29:24.300
SARAH: I don't think I'd be very
good company tonight.

29:24.550 --> 29:26.308
CHEAT: I find that hard to believe.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.582
CHEAT: Come on, we go grab a drink,
maybe you can tell me about it.

29:42.088 --> 29:44.133
(Phone ringing)

29:54.430 --> 29:55.313
(Phone beeps)

29:56.854 --> 29:57.882
(Sighs)

29:59.794 --> 30:01.083
Sarah.

30:02.504 --> 30:04.504
Listen.
You don't need to do this.

30:05.497 --> 30:08.778
Let me go back to Lene
and we can figure something else out.

30:15.416 --> 30:18.723
I'm not saying that they're overpriced.
You're missing my point.

30:18.774 --> 30:21.280
- Then what are you saying?
- I'm saying that I make...

30:21.408 --> 30:24.147
that I make better waffles at home,
with the Proctor Pro.

30:24.344 --> 30:27.693
- The what? - It's the Cadillac of
waffle makers, it's the Proctor Pro.

30:28.073 --> 30:31.122
- Sounds like something for a colonoscopy.
- A what?

30:31.651 --> 30:33.051
Fuck, never mind.

30:37.690 --> 30:39.125
What time you call this?

30:39.153 --> 30:40.553
Oh, is this roll call?

30:41.714 --> 30:45.835
Sorry Ray, I didn't realize.
Next time I'll be more punctual.

30:49.836 --> 30:51.383
(Sighs)

30:51.578 --> 30:53.559
Why do we always have to meet here?

30:53.884 --> 30:57.357
- 'Cause we like playin' golf.
- Whatever, Tiger Woods.

30:59.067 --> 31:00.629
So last night...

31:01.003 --> 31:03.627
I am nailing this sweet, little thing...

31:04.567 --> 31:07.668
and right when I'm about to bust a nut,
you want to know what she did?

31:07.731 --> 31:08.949
- No.
- No.

31:10.503 --> 31:11.930
Seriously, you don't want to know?

31:11.980 --> 31:16.327
No, the details of your high class-romantic
life hardly make polite conversation.

31:17.498 --> 31:20.567
- Motherfucker! - I tell ya I'm
hitting the shit out of this 8.

31:24.444 --> 31:28.080
- Need some new wheels?
- I was thinking a Mustang, maybe. You know?

31:28.985 --> 31:33.684
- GT Premium, maybe a Shelby GT 500?
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?

31:33.704 --> 31:35.535
- How much do they run?
- Oh, I don't know.

31:35.686 --> 31:39.554
Sticker on the GT is 40k,
the Shelby runs at 59k and change.

31:39.588 --> 31:43.189
Yeah, you were throwing a lot of money
around last night with the champagne...

31:44.456 --> 31:45.949
Well...

31:48.293 --> 31:50.164
we were celebrating, so...

31:50.165 --> 31:52.333
How much more you stickin' up
your nose and into hookers?

31:57.442 --> 32:00.919
Oh, I'm sorry, is a...
Is this an intervention?

32:00.920 --> 32:01.920
(Chuckles)

32:02.036 --> 32:04.793
See 'cause we gotta contract.
So we're legit.

32:04.895 --> 32:06.575
We can start spending the money.

32:06.661 --> 32:08.563
Let me spell it out for you, alright?

32:08.626 --> 32:11.166
20 grand a month does not make us legit.

32:11.953 --> 32:14.953
We hire two new techies to reconfigure
Medinationals servers.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.335
Two more to manage the mainframe.

32:17.381 --> 32:20.596
We spend 400 hours, revetting
their middle management team,

32:20.674 --> 32:23.024
pay Uncle Sam, pay ourselves equal shit.

32:23.180 --> 32:25.337
Pay that motherfucker,
Chinese landlord his rent.

32:25.368 --> 32:27.384
How much do you think
we got left, genius?

32:31.234 --> 32:32.634
Zero.

32:43.836 --> 32:46.991
We got 16 months 'til we break even.

32:47.137 --> 32:49.771
- Yup...
- Nobody's spending any money.

32:52.376 --> 32:55.154
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

32:56.101 --> 32:57.501
Good.

33:01.831 --> 33:05.254
Maybe you should start thinking about
a Fiesta or a Ford Focus or something...

33:08.372 --> 33:09.772
Fuck you, Spud.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.840
Oh, yeah.

33:28.687 --> 33:30.540
Am I the only one who's gonna say it?

33:32.587 --> 33:33.987
Jesus!

33:45.648 --> 33:47.998
(Electronic music playing)

34:15.815 --> 34:20.672
(Music continues)

34:33.949 --> 34:37.657
(Music continues)

34:44.914 --> 34:45.914
(Music stops)

34:45.915 --> 34:49.572
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, just assholes who don't tip.

34:57.873 --> 35:00.458
- No, you don't have to.
- I want to.

35:15.834 --> 35:17.234
Right this way.

35:27.410 --> 35:30.221
So a...
Can I make you a drink or something?

35:30.773 --> 35:32.442
- Sure.
- Yeah?

35:53.453 --> 35:55.243
Hey, slow down...

35:58.282 --> 36:00.280
After the day I've had...

36:00.784 --> 36:03.522
- It's my boss, you know?
- Yeah, I know the feeling...

36:04.483 --> 36:07.074
I mean, he's not really my boss.

36:07.682 --> 36:10.574
Thinks he is.
That's the problem.

36:11.385 --> 36:13.571
You should try being a waitress.

36:14.871 --> 36:16.794
So quit.

36:17.044 --> 36:20.983
You're young, beautiful.
You can do anything.

36:25.088 --> 36:27.733
I mean, what do you a...
What do you want to do?

36:31.775 --> 36:35.041
I think you're the first person
to ever ask me that.

36:35.855 --> 36:37.130
Come on.

36:39.712 --> 36:41.112
Seriously?

36:42.665 --> 36:47.093
OK, Abby. If you could do anything in the
whole-wide world, what would it be?

36:52.455 --> 36:53.855
I don't know...

36:55.994 --> 36:57.648
That's pretty sad, right?

37:28.109 --> 37:29.928
Would you give me just one second?

38:06.966 --> 38:08.166
Hello?

38:09.269 --> 38:12.031
(Music playing)

38:26.207 --> 38:29.166
- I like your lights!
- It's like my own private night club.

38:29.288 --> 38:30.688
Welcome to Cheat's!

38:35.128 --> 38:38.993
- Oh, no. No, no, I don't dance...
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes...

38:40.023 --> 38:41.023
(Both laughing)

38:41.024 --> 38:43.564
Come on, come on.

38:43.565 --> 38:45.087
Come on, come on.

38:50.054 --> 38:54.204
(Cheat singing)

38:54.205 --> 38:57.982
(Both singing)

39:06.993 --> 39:08.618
(Knocking on door)

39:10.162 --> 39:11.536
(Knocking on door twice, louder)

39:14.788 --> 39:16.105
What?

39:17.473 --> 39:18.873
Who is it?

39:19.738 --> 39:21.138
Kendra.

39:22.187 --> 39:23.892
Party time.

40:23.594 --> 40:26.094
Come on. Come on.

40:42.595 --> 40:44.637
Alright, let's go to the bedroom.

40:59.958 --> 41:04.294
- Sorry, I'm just gonna...
- Listen, it's gonna be alright.

41:04.596 --> 41:05.996
OK?

41:10.858 --> 41:12.705
I'll be there in a minute.

41:21.753 --> 41:24.463
(Kendra laughs, sighs)

41:32.964 --> 41:34.690
You like that? Huh?

41:34.691 --> 41:36.251
(Kendra laughing)

41:49.514 --> 41:51.867
(Kendra moaning)

42:03.868 --> 42:05.303
(Kendra chuckles)

42:20.067 --> 42:21.573
(Kendra moaning)

42:35.672 --> 42:38.391
(Moaning continues)

42:46.991 --> 42:51.178
(Moaning continues, louder)

42:54.716 --> 42:57.258
(Both moan)

43:01.656 --> 43:03.929
(Laughing)

43:06.321 --> 43:08.319
(Panting)

43:35.614 --> 43:37.204
CHEAT: What are you doing?

43:50.239 --> 43:51.765
Earring.

44:07.143 --> 44:09.182
Cheat was picked up four months ago,

44:09.244 --> 44:11.479
some prostitute said
he tried to strangle her.

44:14.245 --> 44:16.766
I think we should bring Sarah in
and we should talk to her

44:16.815 --> 44:19.069
try to find another way
of doing this thing.

44:22.192 --> 44:25.421
Yeah, the complaint was withdrawn.
That's why it wasn't in the file.

44:28.952 --> 44:31.586
I realize that Lene. Yeah.
(Phone ringing)

44:32.328 --> 44:34.250
That's Sarah on the phone, now.

44:34.321 --> 44:36.432
Let me talk to her
and then I'll call you back.

44:36.659 --> 44:38.259
Yeah. I'll call you back.

44:41.198 --> 44:42.398
Shit.

44:49.174 --> 44:52.898
Grace, it's me.
I'm at Cheat's, everything's fucked!

44:53.067 --> 44:56.808
They're after me Grace, they're after me.
Leave me alone!

45:25.664 --> 45:27.529
Oh, God. Sarah.

45:29.478 --> 45:30.878
Fuck!

45:37.548 --> 45:40.086
(Electronic music playing)
