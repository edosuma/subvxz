00:09.880 --> 00:10.887
- Hi. Hey.
- Ladies.

00:15.697 --> 00:17.445
Mama, things are going great.

00:17.470 --> 00:20.244
Yes, the soil is dead, but
Mike spent the last two weeks

00:20.294 --> 00:23.390
- researching soil revitalization, and...
<i>- The soil is dead?</i>

00:23.429 --> 00:24.857
What do you mean the soil is dead?

00:24.901 --> 00:26.859
The soil on the farm that
you threw away your life for,

00:26.903 --> 00:28.382
that soil is dead?

00:28.426 --> 00:30.080
<i>What are you doing
while he's teaching himself</i>

00:30.115 --> 00:31.564
- <i>how to farm?</i>
- Well, I-I-I'm... I'm unpacking

00:31.589 --> 00:34.007
'cause I got to sift through all
of Aunt Maggie's stuff

00:34.039 --> 00:35.329
- and get it...
- <i>I got an idea.</i>

00:35.392 --> 00:37.176
Start a fire,
take the insurance money...

00:37.201 --> 00:38.138
don't look back!

00:38.163 --> 00:39.918
Arson is almost impossible to prove.

00:39.962 --> 00:42.138
I wish you could see it out here, Mom.
It's so beautiful.

00:42.181 --> 00:44.749
The sky and the fresh air and...

00:46.751 --> 00:47.809
- What was that?!
<i>- It's a goat.</i>

00:47.834 --> 00:49.267
- I'm fine. Yeah.
<i>- A goat? Rio!</i>

00:49.311 --> 00:50.312
Rudy's got a...

00:50.363 --> 00:51.789
...goat that screams like a human man.

00:51.814 --> 00:53.671
Rudy's the homeless man

00:53.715 --> 00:55.455
<i>who's living in your barn?!</i>

00:55.499 --> 00:57.588
If I'm homeless, why is the barn my home?

00:57.632 --> 00:58.807
Ha ha. Got her.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.678
- That's a... good one. It's true.
<i>- Hello?</i>

01:00.722 --> 01:03.638
Um, is there... I see
there's a chicken, also, there?

01:03.681 --> 01:05.988
She's a stray. Theresa likes her.

01:06.031 --> 01:07.990
- I'm sorry... who's Theresa?
- The goat.

01:08.033 --> 01:09.644
Isn't that the name
of your ex-wife or...?

01:09.687 --> 01:11.776
Yes, but it has no significance.

01:13.041 --> 01:15.301
Um, okay, so, there's gonna be
a chicken and a goat...

01:15.345 --> 01:17.173
- Anjelica.
- I'm sorry... who's Anjelica?

01:17.216 --> 01:18.217
The chicken.

01:18.261 --> 01:19.861
She stays. She's Theresa's best friend.

01:19.907 --> 01:21.386
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:21.438 --> 01:23.165
- Oh. Copy that.
- Hey, honey!

01:23.205 --> 01:25.545
Um, Mom, I gotta go, but
I just don't want you to worry,

01:25.573 --> 01:27.879
- because Mike has got this.
<i>- Oh, "Mike's got this."</i>

01:27.923 --> 01:29.315
<i>- Now I'm gonna sleep great...</i>
- Bye.

01:29.351 --> 01:30.684
I found a nickel!

01:30.709 --> 01:32.652
- You what?
- Like Indiana Jones out here,

01:32.677 --> 01:34.605
- just bumping into artifacts...
- What...

01:34.668 --> 01:36.845
...from 2012.

01:36.888 --> 01:40.370
- Oh.
- Still, seven years ain't nothin'.

01:40.413 --> 01:41.980
- Yeah.
- I claim this land.

01:42.024 --> 01:43.808
Farmer boy, you're looking hot!

01:43.852 --> 01:46.028
Hot piece of ass
collecting soil samples.

01:46.071 --> 01:48.155
I-I'm sorry, honey.
I can't hear you. What?

01:48.180 --> 01:50.206
Farmer boy, so hot. You're
a hot piece of ass.

01:50.249 --> 01:51.424
Thank you. Thank you.

01:55.472 --> 01:57.430
If we plant the clover in
time for the rain,

01:57.474 --> 01:59.041
next year, we can diversify crops.

01:59.084 --> 02:01.470
We could be sitting on a
pretty dope microbial base.

02:01.495 --> 02:04.176
- Whoo! Sounds like we got a plan!
- Yeah!

02:04.220 --> 02:05.874
Houston, we have a plan.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.006
- Problem, right? Hou...
- No.

02:08.050 --> 02:09.616
"Houston, we have a plan."

02:09.660 --> 02:11.880
"Problem"... it's like,
"Houston, we have a problem."

02:11.923 --> 02:14.709
I'm going from the movie,
when Tom Hanks radios down.

02:14.752 --> 02:16.546
He says, "Houston, we have a plan."

02:16.571 --> 02:18.800
You're just gonna have to believe
me on this one, 'cause it's...

02:18.843 --> 02:20.802
Oh, zhush!

02:20.845 --> 02:23.065
Hey, there, buddy. Hey.

02:29.985 --> 02:31.247
Yeah. That's about right.

02:31.290 --> 02:33.902
Okay.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.067
Hi, Aunt Maggie,
you sweet, sweet hoarder.

02:37.035 --> 02:38.602
Ohh!

02:38.646 --> 02:41.997
Turn... away... demon... child... dolls.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.694
Do you want to get lunch?

02:43.738 --> 02:45.217
You know what? I'm fighting the light.

02:45.261 --> 02:46.697
- Okay.
- But do you want some bea...

02:46.741 --> 02:48.438
Oh. It's just the juice.

02:48.481 --> 02:49.961
Okay.

02:50.005 --> 02:51.659
- I'm okay.
- All right.

02:53.957 --> 02:55.532
Hey.

02:55.565 --> 02:56.881
Hey.

02:56.925 --> 02:58.840
Honey, you want to do some sex stuff?

02:58.883 --> 03:00.755
Yeah. M-Maybe.

03:00.798 --> 03:02.090
You know, my soil report just came in

03:02.115 --> 03:03.421
from all the samples I bagged up.

03:03.446 --> 03:04.407
Mm-hmmmmmm.

03:04.432 --> 03:07.109
So just looking... Oh, nitrogen is low.

03:07.152 --> 03:09.313
- Phosphate's low. Oof.
- Ooh.

03:09.338 --> 03:10.547
- pH is low.
- Ohh.

03:10.590 --> 03:11.853
Sweet potash numbers.

03:11.896 --> 03:13.811
- Nice.
- Mm!

03:13.855 --> 03:15.987
What do you say we get dirty

03:16.031 --> 03:18.013
and bag some of your samples?

03:19.077 --> 03:20.557
- Wow, that, um...
- Yeah.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.602
- That didn't sound great.
- Yeah, it went south really quickly.

03:24.394 --> 03:27.841
We're just kind of getting used
to being here, really.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.784
<i>Getting used to extreme loneliness</i>

03:29.827 --> 03:31.829
<i>and desperation for human contact?</i>

03:31.873 --> 03:32.961
<i>- Like a prisoner.</i>
- Stop.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.006
Are you even having meals together?

03:35.050 --> 03:36.007
Actually, you know what?
Come to think of it,

03:36.051 --> 03:39.840
we did share some
peanuts together the other day.

03:39.865 --> 03:41.491
- It was kind of cute.
<i>- And you're not having sex.</i>

03:41.534 --> 03:42.971
I can hear it in your voice.

03:43.006 --> 03:44.704
<i>- A mother always knows...</i>
- Ma!

03:44.755 --> 03:46.148
...when her daughter's not getting any!

03:46.191 --> 03:48.317
Okay, $9.45.

03:48.342 --> 03:49.978
You coming to the potluck today?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.153
Are you gonna invite Mike and Rio?

03:51.196 --> 03:52.415
Oh, should I?

03:52.458 --> 03:54.678
I wouldn't want them
to feel pressured to come

03:54.722 --> 03:56.114
and then actually come.

03:56.158 --> 03:58.160
Your mom invited me to a potluck when
I was new in town.

03:58.203 --> 03:59.161
What if they rob me?

03:59.204 --> 04:00.684
Or, heaven forbid,

04:00.728 --> 04:02.773
they turn all my buckets
upside down and drum on them?

04:02.817 --> 04:04.035
Why would they do that, Kay?

04:04.079 --> 04:05.776
I don't know
what New Yorkers do for fun.

04:05.820 --> 04:08.185
And sorry to say this, but
have you seen her tight tops?

04:08.217 --> 04:09.831
I think she might be promiscuous.

04:09.867 --> 04:11.086
Come on, now.

04:11.129 --> 04:13.001
Mom, just... j... j...
Hold on a second, okay?

04:13.044 --> 04:14.437
- Hey, Constance.
- Hey, Miss Rio.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.786
- Hey, Kay.
<i>- I can't see anything!</i>

04:15.811 --> 04:18.048
<i>- I can't see you!</i>
- Oh.

04:18.093 --> 04:19.521
- Sorry, Mom.
<i>- When was the last time</i>

04:19.546 --> 04:21.310
<i>that you and Mike had intercourse?</i>

04:21.334 --> 04:23.054
No, Mom... Mom! Mom!

04:23.098 --> 04:25.535
- You're on video chat. Shh!
<i>- And I mean real, loving...</i>

04:25.578 --> 04:28.625
- Hi. Just...
<i>- ...emotionally connected intercourse?</i>

04:28.668 --> 04:30.665
<i>Once the sex goes, everything goes...</i>

04:31.846 --> 04:33.848
It's just, uh...

04:33.891 --> 04:35.763
I'll get you a new can of clams, Kent.

04:35.806 --> 04:37.068
Thanks, Connie.

04:37.112 --> 04:38.896
Sorry about that.

04:38.940 --> 04:42.030
Guess you know more about me now.

04:44.772 --> 04:47.339
We're having a potluck today at 4:00.

04:47.383 --> 04:48.993
I'm inviting you.

04:49.037 --> 04:50.386
And that's it.

04:50.429 --> 04:52.301
A-A potluck.

04:52.344 --> 04:53.650
I... We would love to come.

04:54.956 --> 04:56.958
"Potluck" means
you have to bring something.

04:57.001 --> 04:58.263
I know that.

04:58.307 --> 04:59.961
Thank you.

05:00.004 --> 05:01.614
Can I have my bag?

05:03.399 --> 05:05.662
- Bye, now.
- Bye, Miss Kay.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.664
And don't forget to bring something.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.400
When she says "bring something"...

05:09.431 --> 05:12.103
- Food.
- Food. Okay. Cool, cool.

05:12.147 --> 05:13.888
And that means
just sort of buy something

05:13.931 --> 05:15.411
- and put it on...
- You make it.

05:15.454 --> 05:16.978
Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay.

05:17.021 --> 05:20.895
Just, like, a classic potluck situation.

05:20.938 --> 05:22.374
Hon, I can't go to that potluck.

05:22.418 --> 05:24.942
I got to finish digging this
ditch before the rain comes.

05:24.986 --> 05:26.596
I know, but I was just thinking, like,

05:26.639 --> 05:27.902
maybe we could just take a break,

05:27.945 --> 05:29.599
and we could do it how we
did it in New York...

05:29.642 --> 05:31.035
our Saturday date night.

05:31.079 --> 05:32.602
Remember the one time we got so drunk

05:32.645 --> 05:35.866
that we just did it in the bathroom
of that Thai bistro? Whoo!

05:35.910 --> 05:38.047
- Oh. Wow, what a night.
- You know.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.044
Well, you would've thought
my performance would've been affected

05:40.088 --> 05:42.699
by that Thai gal
banging on the bathroom door,

05:42.742 --> 05:44.687
- but one of my better showings.
- Indeed.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.835
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

05:45.860 --> 05:47.922
What is this?
You think this is a poop or a rock?

05:47.965 --> 05:49.967
That's a rock.

05:50.011 --> 05:51.751
No, that's... that's a poop.

05:51.795 --> 05:54.102
- That's poop all the way.
- No, that's not breaking.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.146
- That's a rock.
- Oh, she'll break.

05:55.190 --> 05:56.211
This def a poo.

05:56.243 --> 05:57.460
- I don't know, girl.
- Let me see.

05:57.488 --> 05:59.099
- Ho!
- Hey-o!

05:59.150 --> 06:01.844
Hey! Hello, there, little poop!

06:01.869 --> 06:03.459
- Poop, there it is!
- Welcome to the farm!

06:03.502 --> 06:05.156
- Ohh.
- Oh, that's great.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.505
Ah...

06:06.549 --> 06:09.465
Yeah, we should definitely
get a date night done tonight.

06:09.508 --> 06:10.770
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:10.814 --> 06:12.053
Great!

06:14.085 --> 06:17.615
Mike does most of the cooking,
but I do infuse my own water,

06:17.640 --> 06:18.703
which is kind of great.

06:18.728 --> 06:21.035
It's got cucumber and rosemary.
It's very cleansing...

06:21.079 --> 06:24.299
Missy, if you bring vegetable
water to this potluck,

06:24.343 --> 06:25.702
I will arrest you myself.

06:25.781 --> 06:28.155
- Yeah.
- We're going to make an icebox cake

06:28.180 --> 06:29.804
- with no cooking required.
- That's good.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.573
Hey, neighbor.

06:35.617 --> 06:38.446
Hey, Mike! You remember me? Jacob!

06:38.489 --> 06:41.196
We've been here for two weeks,
Jacob. Uh, I got it.

06:41.229 --> 06:43.375
Hey, I noticed
your tiny electric vehicle's

06:43.400 --> 06:44.618
riding kind of low.

06:44.643 --> 06:45.714
What do you got in there?

06:45.758 --> 06:47.890
It's tiny, but it's big on efficiency.

06:47.934 --> 06:49.718
I, uh, I got some seed back there.

06:49.762 --> 06:52.373
Once I hook up the spreader
to that bad boy,

06:52.416 --> 06:55.028
gonna lay down some
nutrient-rich organic matter.

06:55.071 --> 06:57.996
It's called manure. You don't
have to put a tuxedo on it.

06:58.021 --> 07:00.512
Yeah. Well, then I'm gonna
plant some clover.

07:00.537 --> 07:03.059
- I'm gonna use a no-till method.
- No-till, huh?

07:03.084 --> 07:04.803
Here's a pro-tip... till.

07:04.864 --> 07:07.523
And, you know, they're saying
that tilling is a major force

07:07.548 --> 07:08.890
in topsoil loss.

07:08.915 --> 07:10.484
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plant

07:10.509 --> 07:12.931
and I'm gonna let the rain
sink the seed.

07:12.956 --> 07:15.048
I mean, the science behind it
is really impressive.

07:15.091 --> 07:16.739
It might even interest you
for your fields.

07:16.764 --> 07:18.473
Hmm. For my fields.

07:18.498 --> 07:20.208
Hey, do you mind
if I give you some advice?

07:20.233 --> 07:21.530
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

07:21.555 --> 07:24.100
Why don't you go to school
for agricultural science

07:24.144 --> 07:26.106
and then work a farm for 20 years,

07:26.131 --> 07:30.411
then come back and tell me
how to run my fields. Okay?

07:30.454 --> 07:32.282
You made my dad's face red.

07:33.849 --> 07:35.691
Well... I went to college, too.

07:35.738 --> 07:37.363
Is that so? What'd you study?

07:37.388 --> 07:39.347
Philosophy.

07:39.372 --> 07:40.571
Of music.

07:41.422 --> 07:43.110
Gonna let that sit there.

07:44.721 --> 07:47.005
Hey, about that rain next Tuesday,
it's not gonna happen.

07:47.030 --> 07:48.945
Not gonna rain for a while now.

07:48.979 --> 07:50.810
So looks to me like you are

07:50.835 --> 07:53.567
nutrient-rich-organic-matter
out of luck.

07:55.334 --> 07:57.075
Bye, Mike!

07:57.119 --> 07:58.468
Watch your toes!

08:04.640 --> 08:06.990
Hey, sweetie! You ready
to go to the potluck?

08:12.767 --> 08:14.508
Hon, I... I can't go.

08:14.614 --> 08:17.008
I can't... I can't... The...

08:17.060 --> 08:19.029
The forecast changed. There's no rain.

08:19.122 --> 08:21.944
So, basically, right now, we have no plan.

08:21.977 --> 08:24.180
- Okay.
- Houston, we have no plan!

08:25.538 --> 08:28.063
So sorry, but that...
that really is literally

08:28.106 --> 08:31.109
the time you could've said,
"Houston, we have a problem."

08:31.153 --> 08:32.899
What?

08:32.946 --> 08:35.200
No th... It's fine. No, it's fine.

08:35.244 --> 08:38.640
Um, sweetie, don't you think
it's a good idea

08:38.697 --> 08:41.796
to maybe get out of the barn,
put some clean pants on,

08:41.821 --> 08:43.674
and come spend an hour with your wife?

08:43.725 --> 08:46.293
I mean, isn't that why
we're here in the first place?

08:46.337 --> 08:47.947
Like, to spend more time together.

08:47.991 --> 08:49.775
It's, like, we could...

08:49.819 --> 08:51.466
pretend we're having
a New York date night.

08:51.491 --> 08:53.372
W... I-I... This isn't New York.

08:53.397 --> 08:55.302
We can't afford to be impulsive

08:55.346 --> 08:57.502
and do it in the bathroom of
a Thai restaurant

08:57.527 --> 08:59.275
and then just go back
out and order dessert.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.400
We got to build the Thai restaurant

09:01.425 --> 09:02.635
with our own two hands

09:02.660 --> 09:04.260
if we want to do it in the bathroom.

09:04.285 --> 09:06.346
We need a plan, and we
need to get to work.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.763
How good was the plan in the first place

09:07.788 --> 09:10.020
if the whole thing falls apart
because of one rain forecast?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.085
- How good was the plan in the first place?
- I'm sorry.

09:12.129 --> 09:13.295
- That's your...
- I'm not trying to upset you.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.342
All I'm saying is that

09:14.367 --> 09:16.895
I-I am also having some trouble here.

09:16.920 --> 09:17.932
I'm kind of freaking out

09:17.969 --> 09:20.158
because I feel very out of place,

09:20.190 --> 09:22.847
and you're kind of
the only person in the world

09:22.872 --> 09:24.743
who can make it all okay.

09:26.064 --> 09:28.762
And now it's like I don't
really have you, either.

09:28.797 --> 09:32.024
So please, come to the potluck with me.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.821
You don't have to do it just for me.

09:33.846 --> 09:36.563
Do it... Do it for us.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.127
I can't go.

09:42.072 --> 09:44.340
Oh, did you guys hear?
It is not gonna rain.

09:44.365 --> 09:45.453
Oh, my God.

09:45.478 --> 09:47.947
Rudy, please, you got to let
us know when you're in here.

09:47.991 --> 09:49.340
I apologize.

09:49.383 --> 09:50.634
- We...
- I'm in here.

09:52.212 --> 09:53.241
Got it.

09:53.266 --> 09:56.129
Honey, go to the potluck.
I want you to have fun.

09:56.173 --> 09:57.522
Okay.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.224
Okay.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.575
- Hi.
- Oh!

10:07.619 --> 10:09.256
I carried this on my handlebars,

10:09.281 --> 10:10.935
so it kind of sloshed all to the right,

10:10.960 --> 10:13.084
so you might need to... spruce it up.

10:13.109 --> 10:14.414
Is that what it needs?

10:16.851 --> 10:18.598
- Potluck!
- Oh, yes. Come in.

10:18.683 --> 10:19.989
You dressed up.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.130
Ooh. That's a healthy pour.

10:26.169 --> 10:27.993
Mike couldn't be here, so it's fi...

10:28.037 --> 10:29.691
I don't... I'm, like, cool with that.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.640
It's just more that I feel like
I have to loosen up.

10:31.692 --> 10:33.698
The good news is
that I'm really fun at parties.

10:33.731 --> 10:34.745
I went to this fundraiser,

10:34.785 --> 10:36.977
and I got Bloomberg to do the worm.

10:37.002 --> 10:39.352
So...

10:39.396 --> 10:41.079
A lot of people were talking about it.

10:41.104 --> 10:42.964
We just really want
to get our hands dirty.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.765
You couldn't get
your hands dirty in New York?

10:44.790 --> 10:45.920
Mm!

10:45.945 --> 10:47.584
You can, but it's more like,

10:47.609 --> 10:50.342
"I just touched my hand to a
subway pole, rubbed my eye,

10:50.367 --> 10:52.141
and now I've got pink eye"
kind of dirty.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.802
Well, I hope you find a husband here.

10:54.846 --> 10:58.154
- Yeah.
- Oh. No, I-I'm married. I...

10:58.197 --> 10:59.633
- Ohh.
- Well...

10:59.677 --> 11:01.235
- Sure. Of course.
- No.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.784
Remember Father Time... he clicks away.

11:03.809 --> 11:05.862
- Yeah.
- I mean, you still look very pretty,

11:05.887 --> 11:08.614
but he's gonna take that all away soon.

11:08.639 --> 11:10.079
But that's my sad story,

11:10.122 --> 11:12.864
so, you... w-what's the deal with you?
Why are you here alone?

11:12.907 --> 11:14.735
My boyfriend and I just broke up.

11:16.824 --> 11:18.932
Did you say "boyfriend"?

11:18.957 --> 11:20.949
I love that.

11:20.982 --> 11:22.795
You love it? What does that mean?

11:22.830 --> 11:24.476
I'm from New York. I get it.

11:24.501 --> 11:26.878
I-I'm an advocate. I
march for your rights.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.314
I spent Halloweens in the Village.

11:28.358 --> 11:29.968
You know, I was like...
I'm surrounded by...

11:30.011 --> 11:32.164
like, in college I had a whole stint...

11:32.189 --> 11:33.554
dated a girl for a long time.

11:33.579 --> 11:35.919
Anyway, the point is, I'm
not gonna treat you differently

11:35.944 --> 11:37.031
than anyone else here.

11:37.056 --> 11:38.492
Starting when?

11:44.769 --> 11:45.850
Oh.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.863
You know what I turn to
when I'm looking for answers?

11:47.899 --> 11:49.533
Those two...

11:49.558 --> 11:50.902
Theresa and Anjelica.

11:50.945 --> 11:54.079
Uh, I'm so turned around,
I'll try anything.

11:54.123 --> 11:57.737
Is borage or clover
a better cover crop for us?

12:02.207 --> 12:03.730
What am I looking for?

12:03.755 --> 12:05.612
Do they nod or scratch
or show me a hoof?

12:05.656 --> 12:07.407
I think you may have lost your mind, Mike.

12:08.354 --> 12:11.270
- Y-You told me to...
- I just meant to watch them.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.447
- They've got all the answers, don't they?
- They just look like

12:14.491 --> 12:16.882
a couple of weird,
codependent farm animals to me.

12:16.907 --> 12:18.055
Bingo.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.497
They don't belong together, but
they make each other better.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.194
You go be with your wife.

12:23.282 --> 12:27.112
Rudy, I would love to go
with my wife to a potluck,

12:27.156 --> 12:28.940
but it's not gonna rain,

12:28.998 --> 12:31.479
and we don't have any money
to buy an irrigation system...

12:31.508 --> 12:32.987
Can you make it rain?

12:33.031 --> 12:34.293
No.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.947
Can you make the wind change direction?

12:35.990 --> 12:36.948
No.

12:36.991 --> 12:38.906
What's the one thing you can do?

12:40.821 --> 12:44.173
Trust me. I live alone in a barn
with a goat named after my ex-wife.

12:44.216 --> 12:45.441
Go to the potluck.

12:48.002 --> 12:49.250
Thank you.

12:49.275 --> 12:50.788
- Don't thank me.
- Right.

12:50.831 --> 12:53.226
Uh, thank you, Anjelica and Theresa.

12:53.259 --> 12:55.235
Again, they're animals.
They do not speak English.

12:55.271 --> 12:57.526
Mike, I'm starting to think that
you might bea little bit dense.

13:03.187 --> 13:06.213
My cake is in the trash?

13:06.238 --> 13:08.284
Aw, man.

13:08.327 --> 13:09.850
Hey, honey.

13:09.894 --> 13:11.200
Oh, you doing a little Dumpster diving?

13:11.243 --> 13:12.418
- Hi!
- Mm.

13:12.462 --> 13:14.812
- You came. You came.
- Yeah.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.544
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
I should've come way sooner.

13:17.592 --> 13:19.563
- Got so wrapped up in the whole planting...
- It's all right. It's all right.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.166
Mike! Welcome.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.899
See you braved that storm
we're not having

13:22.924 --> 13:24.369
to make it over tonight.

13:24.394 --> 13:26.084
There's a new thing called the forecast

13:26.127 --> 13:28.260
that all the farmers
are using these days.

13:28.304 --> 13:29.435
Actually, Beau,

13:29.479 --> 13:31.808
Mike has been coming up with a new plan,

13:31.833 --> 13:33.646
and it's gonna be amazing.

13:33.671 --> 13:36.399
Oh! 'Cause you learned
how to be a farmer

13:36.442 --> 13:38.052
from two weeks on the Internet.

13:38.096 --> 13:39.404
I spent two weeks on the Internet,

13:39.429 --> 13:42.143
and I got blocked on Twitter five times.

13:42.187 --> 13:44.407
- She got a bad mouth.
- Hi, Jacob.

13:44.450 --> 13:46.060
- Hi.
- Why don't you take a tip

13:46.104 --> 13:47.473
from a guy who's been part of a family

13:47.498 --> 13:49.455
that's been doing it
for a hundred years?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.732
Quit now.

13:50.757 --> 13:52.284
Go back to New York.

13:52.328 --> 13:54.179
I'll take that farm off your hands.

13:55.069 --> 13:56.400
Thanks for the potluck.

13:56.425 --> 13:58.464
- We're gonna take off.
- No, no, no. Hang on.

13:58.508 --> 14:00.118
It's true.

14:00.161 --> 14:02.990
Mike may not have as much dirt
under his fingernails

14:03.034 --> 14:04.962
as you, Beau, but you don't have

14:04.987 --> 14:08.518
a speck of the dirt
that Mike has in his heart.

14:11.085 --> 14:13.479
Because no one cares as much,

14:13.523 --> 14:16.707
and no one tries as hard
as this man right here.

14:16.732 --> 14:17.865
Thank you, hon.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.723
I have seen this man
open a bottle of wine

14:20.748 --> 14:21.899
with a pair of scissors.

14:21.924 --> 14:25.171
I've seen this man
get a day-of brunch reservation

14:25.196 --> 14:27.450
for eight people at 11:30 a.m.

14:27.493 --> 14:29.888
on a Sunday of a three-day weekend!

14:29.913 --> 14:31.958
This man can do anything!

14:31.983 --> 14:34.544
So you watch us nail this farming thing.

14:34.587 --> 14:35.762
And let me tell you something else.

14:35.806 --> 14:37.677
You want to talk about
forecast, Beau? Let me...

14:37.721 --> 14:39.723
Oh, yeah, I think it's cloudy,

14:39.766 --> 14:41.759
with a chance of us kicking your ass.

14:41.784 --> 14:43.379
- Hey!
- Excuse me?!

14:43.430 --> 14:45.229
Just to be clear, that was metaphorical.

14:45.254 --> 14:47.252
- She's not threatening violence.
- Well, it wasn't clear.

14:47.296 --> 14:49.689
And excuse me, Kay. This is a cake.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.021
And it deserves to be right here,

14:52.046 --> 14:54.607
on the dessert table,
with all the other cakes,

14:54.651 --> 14:57.523
- 'cause cake equality!
- Cake equality?!

14:57.567 --> 14:59.699
Not in my house!

14:59.743 --> 15:01.614
That was awesome!

15:01.658 --> 15:03.476
That felt awesome!

15:03.508 --> 15:04.798
- I'm so sorry, sweetie.
- No, no, honey.

15:04.835 --> 15:06.775
- No, I-I-I am.
- I'm sorry. I left you alone.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.708
I just have all this pressure to
make sure everything's perfect

15:08.752 --> 15:10.319
because I'm the one who got fired,

15:10.362 --> 15:12.712
- it was my idea to move out here, and...
- You know what? Huh?

15:12.756 --> 15:15.851
Honestly, even if
it all just falls apart,

15:15.876 --> 15:17.500
it's you and me,

15:17.543 --> 15:19.399
and that... that is all that matters.

15:19.424 --> 15:21.982
Oh, honey. Mm.

15:22.026 --> 15:23.984
I don't know if you know
this, but they opened up

15:24.028 --> 15:25.891
a little Thai bistro in the Bowman barn.

15:25.923 --> 15:26.943
That's so weird.

15:26.979 --> 15:28.096
- Yeah... Uh-huh.
- Oh!

15:28.121 --> 15:30.018
Oh, Thai bistro.

15:30.043 --> 15:31.435
- Yeah, yeah.
- I get it. Mm.

15:31.470 --> 15:33.242
Okay, do you want it mild or spicy?

15:33.274 --> 15:35.367
Well, I like it spicy, but
a-also mild would be fine,

15:35.392 --> 15:36.436
'cause it's been a really long day.

15:36.461 --> 15:38.278
- Okay, that's fair.
- Yeah.

15:38.318 --> 15:39.524
- Aah! Cows!
- It's okay. It's okay.

15:39.549 --> 15:42.133
T-They're behind the fence.
They're behind the fence.

15:43.953 --> 15:46.442
Oh, cows, cows, cows, cows, cows.

15:46.485 --> 15:47.704
Ignore it. Block them out.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.937
Okay.

15:49.962 --> 15:51.070
Oh, yeah.

15:51.095 --> 15:52.622
Let's do it. You're so strong.

15:52.665 --> 15:54.381
Okay, hold on.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.328
- You want to do some weird barn sex?
- Yeah!

15:56.353 --> 15:58.632
- This is like "Animal Farm."
- Ooh! Is that a...

15:58.667 --> 16:00.630
- I didn't read that.
- Yeah.

16:00.673 --> 16:02.066
It's not that hot, but just go with it.

16:02.109 --> 16:03.415
Oh, Mike.

16:04.503 --> 16:06.212
- Mike. Mike.
- Oh, do I smell?

16:06.237 --> 16:07.637
I know. I thought we could push through.

16:09.077 --> 16:10.988
There's a bull.

16:11.031 --> 16:13.207
- There's a bull... Don't look!
- There's a bull behind me?

16:13.251 --> 16:14.980
Is it doing this with his hoofs?

16:15.005 --> 16:17.612
- 'Cause that's when they're gonna charge.
- It's, like... frothing.

16:17.637 --> 16:19.198
- We gotta go.
- No, shh! Don't move!

16:19.223 --> 16:21.134
Oh, my gosh! Aah!

16:21.159 --> 16:22.652
Ohh!

16:22.695 --> 16:23.957
He just... shot right out.

16:24.001 --> 16:26.612
W-Why was he in here
by himself, do you think?

16:26.656 --> 16:28.003
I do not know.

16:28.035 --> 16:29.187
Oh.

16:29.212 --> 16:30.888
- Oh, all right. T-That's why.
- Ohh.

16:30.913 --> 16:32.836
Oh, dear. I think we got
him all hot and bothered.

16:32.879 --> 16:34.751
- Ooh.
- Oh, my goodness.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.695
- Okay, now he's moving on to the next.
- Girl.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.726
- Yeah, I see that.
- It's a numbers games for him.

16:38.751 --> 16:41.540
- Yikes.
- Um... this is not good.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.934
Houston, we have a problem.

16:43.977 --> 16:45.972
Oh. Y... That sounds right.

16:48.332 --> 16:51.463
Before we begin,
I think apologies are in order.

16:51.507 --> 16:53.509
Yes, we are sorry

16:53.552 --> 16:56.425
that we tried to make love in your barn

16:56.468 --> 16:58.992
in such a way that freed your bull

16:59.036 --> 17:02.692
and caused it to make love
to all your cows.

17:02.735 --> 17:04.911
Yeah. Uh, we feel terrible...

17:04.954 --> 17:06.478
- Terrible.
- ...that you had to...

17:06.521 --> 17:08.348
it looks like, fight it?

17:08.393 --> 17:10.526
Most of the night, yeah.

17:10.569 --> 17:11.788
- Okay.
- Well...

17:11.830 --> 17:15.269
But you got a lot of fun
Band-Aids going on there.

17:15.320 --> 17:16.950
- Uh, anyway...
- Yeah.

17:16.974 --> 17:18.888
...we sincerely apologize.

17:18.914 --> 17:21.624
If it's any consolation,
I just want to say that,

17:21.666 --> 17:23.582
for Mike and I,

17:23.626 --> 17:25.061
it was a really important night, and...

17:25.097 --> 17:26.861
It was kind of a breakthrough,
'cause we were

17:26.894 --> 17:28.425
- feeling pretty disconnected...
- Oh, good.

17:28.451 --> 17:30.676
- ...'cause of the stress, I guess.
- Just to lessen the mood.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.423
- Miss Kay.
- Okay.

17:32.470 --> 17:34.506
Oh, um, I'm trying to think of something

17:34.542 --> 17:35.960
that we should apologize for.

17:35.992 --> 17:39.038
I guess we should've offered our
bedroom for your lovemaking?

17:39.063 --> 17:40.596
How about apologizing

17:40.621 --> 17:42.774
for throwing their cake in the trash?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.648
- I'm sorry.
- And talking trash?

17:45.673 --> 17:47.313
Sorry.

17:47.338 --> 17:49.347
All right. Doesn't everybody
feel a little better?

17:49.406 --> 17:51.496
- Yeah.
- Okay, now on to the damages.

17:51.523 --> 17:53.351
You owe us $50,000.

17:53.394 --> 17:54.550
I'm sorry... what?

17:54.589 --> 17:56.729
The Bowmans sell bull semen to China.

17:56.754 --> 17:58.067
I am a stud merchant!

17:58.092 --> 18:00.677
That's right, and that bull's
"genetic material"

18:00.702 --> 18:01.825
was supposed to be frozen

18:01.850 --> 18:04.153
and on a slow boat to Beijing
this morning!

18:04.178 --> 18:05.146
This morning!

18:05.171 --> 18:07.262
And as their attorney, I can verify

18:07.287 --> 18:08.888
they were due $50,000

18:08.913 --> 18:11.693
upon delivery of the... specimens.

18:11.718 --> 18:13.240
- I thought you were our attorney.
- You're our attorney.

18:13.284 --> 18:15.957
I'm the only lawyer in Bucksnort.

18:15.982 --> 18:17.553
I'm everyone's attorney.

18:17.578 --> 18:20.295
And I would advise you
to negotiate down to $40,000,

18:20.320 --> 18:23.000
because I have a feeling that
they're going to agree to it.

18:23.032 --> 18:25.109
- Forty is fair.
- No! We don't have $40,000.

18:25.148 --> 18:26.343
I'll see you in court, then.

18:26.375 --> 18:27.780
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay, o-okay.
- W-Wait. Hold on.

18:27.805 --> 18:29.648
- Let's ju... Hey, hey.
- Hold on a second. We don't have it.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.089
I...

18:31.114 --> 18:33.696
- Do you want to take our tractor?
- Hmm.

18:33.739 --> 18:36.089
- Wait.
- Well, Jacob's coming of age.

18:36.133 --> 18:39.743
I guess we could use an old beater
for him to kick around in

18:39.768 --> 18:42.139
- until we get a new one under him.
- Mm-hmm.

18:42.182 --> 18:43.488
That baby's got some years on her,

18:43.532 --> 18:45.399
but I bet she could teach me
a thing or two,

18:45.424 --> 18:46.970
- if you know what I mean, huh?
- Shh! Jacob, no!

18:47.013 --> 18:48.275
This is not okay.

18:48.319 --> 18:50.102
We need the tractor for Mike's plan.

18:50.127 --> 18:52.759
Honey, we'll... we'll
come up with a new plan.

18:52.784 --> 18:55.574
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we'll... we'll figure it out.

18:55.599 --> 18:56.861
Think we got a deal.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.416
- Tractor?
- All right!

18:58.474 --> 19:01.858
I'll invoice you,
and, uh, this was pro Bono.

19:01.883 --> 19:03.670
Otherwise, it's just too depressing.

19:03.695 --> 19:04.928
Thank you.

19:11.908 --> 19:14.780
- You good, babe?
- Yeah.

19:14.824 --> 19:17.109
I mean, it kind of feels like rock bottom,

19:17.134 --> 19:18.242
but other than that...

19:18.274 --> 19:19.793
Oh, you're a ways from rock bottom.

19:19.829 --> 19:21.532
I remember when I lost my tractor.

19:21.557 --> 19:22.788
I thought everything was over.

19:22.832 --> 19:24.657
Then I lost my wife.

19:24.682 --> 19:25.878
- Lost my farm.
- Thank you.

19:25.922 --> 19:27.619
Trying to think if there's
anything else I lost.

19:27.655 --> 19:29.091
- Oh, yeah... both parents, two dogs.
- Rudy...

19:29.142 --> 19:30.100
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:30.143 --> 19:31.415
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

19:32.885 --> 19:35.876
- Hello, Rudy.
- Constance.

19:38.151 --> 19:43.592
Why is your goat standing on
my patrol... vehicle?

19:45.158 --> 19:47.813
She doesn't want you to leave.

19:47.857 --> 19:49.815
Either that or you have cashews inside.

19:52.723 --> 19:53.855
- Honey.
- Yeah?

19:53.915 --> 19:55.351
Look at Anjelica.

19:55.376 --> 19:56.648
Do you see what she's doing?

19:56.692 --> 19:59.956
She's making and spreading nutrient-rich
organic material.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.751
- Poop?
- No, I-I've read about this.

20:01.776 --> 20:04.438
- Okay.
- Okay, just imagine chickens everywhere.

20:04.482 --> 20:06.049
- Right.
- E... E... Fertilizing everything.

20:06.092 --> 20:07.964
- Okay.
- I think we could bring the soil back

20:08.007 --> 20:09.879
without having a tractor.

20:09.922 --> 20:11.794
I mean, it would take a lot more work,

20:11.837 --> 20:13.534
and we would need a ton of chickens.

20:13.578 --> 20:14.881
I... Chicke... You want chickens?

20:14.906 --> 20:16.006
I got chickens. I have an i...

20:16.031 --> 20:17.904
Yeah, let me... I-I'll get you chickens.

20:24.334 --> 20:25.292
- Oh.
- Here we go.

20:25.335 --> 20:26.974
- Oh, boy.
- Hello. Welcome.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.422
- Wise person.
- One chicken is fine for it.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.172
- So, do I just... Yeah? Okay?
- Yeah. Just give it a...

20:31.212 --> 20:32.750
Oh, hon, you're a natural.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.765
- Found this. What do you think?
- Okay!

20:35.817 --> 20:38.080
- Look at this. Chicken for chicken?
- One for one, I suppose.

20:38.114 --> 20:39.552
- Does that feel fair?
- Yeah.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.076
- Yeah, I think you'll really...
- You're gonna like that.

20:42.123 --> 20:43.205
Oh.

20:43.230 --> 20:44.608
- Um...
- That's not...

20:44.652 --> 20:46.285
Uh, no. Just the one.

20:46.324 --> 20:48.022
♪ Have you ever seen the rain?

20:48.057 --> 20:49.907
- Look at that.
- Beautiful. Here we go.

20:49.932 --> 20:51.737
- A dozen dolls for a dozen...
- Okay.

20:51.762 --> 20:53.667
- Shame to see those go.
- Dozen for a dozen.

20:53.692 --> 20:56.608
- You come visit them anytime.
- But you're gonna come visit. Okay.

20:56.633 --> 20:58.664
- Thank you, guys.
- All right, come on.

21:06.643 --> 21:08.031
I think people gave us

21:08.056 --> 21:10.647
their weirdest, most demented chickens.

21:10.690 --> 21:12.953
I like it. It feels like us.

21:12.997 --> 21:16.027
- We're the crazy chicken people now.
- Exactly.

21:16.060 --> 21:17.757
I can live with that.

21:20.970 --> 21:22.449
I'm sorry. They're from New York.
