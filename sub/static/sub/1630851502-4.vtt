00:01.610 --> 00:05.179
- Y'all ready for the news?
"Family Feud" wants us back.

00:05.222 --> 00:07.268
- They want us back?

00:09.052 --> 00:10.488
- We ain't got a point.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.622
- Going back on "Family Feud,"

00:13.665 --> 00:15.493
it was a chance for us
to redeem ourselves.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.365
- What is that?
- What is that?

00:17.408 --> 00:20.150
- Twisted Sister.
- That's your competition.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.328
- Girls trip.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.678
- How weird was it that
you met someone on the plane?

00:26.722 --> 00:28.289
- Y'all were like,
"Oh, my God, Rachel."

00:28.332 --> 00:30.073
And I was like,
"Eh, yeah, cool whatever."

00:30.117 --> 00:32.336
- What's up, ladies?
- Hello, Matt.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.903
- He's a country singer

00:33.946 --> 00:36.297
and he's actually going to be
on "Family Feud" as well.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.689
- From over hearing you talk
on the plane,

00:37.733 --> 00:39.430
your major in college
was philosophy.

00:39.474 --> 00:40.953
- You are pre-Harvard Med.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.652
- Rachel is dying over us.
- Y'all are psycho.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.088
- He likes all animals,
but specifically, dogs.

00:45.132 --> 00:48.178
- Jesus.

00:51.312 --> 00:52.661
- This it Terry Bradshaw.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.880
Is this punk Matt?

01:18.165 --> 01:19.688
<i>- Is this punk Matt?</i>

01:19.731 --> 01:21.081
I'm going to come
down there, boy, and...

01:21.124 --> 01:22.125
- No, no!
- Drag you out.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.433
- I'm sorry.
My grandpa's crazy.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.130
- What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

01:27.174 --> 01:28.610
You got plans?

01:29.915 --> 01:31.482
- Come join us for dinner.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.659
6:30, we'll holler at you
and we'll meet you downstairs.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.445
- Beautiful, okay, bye.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.925
<i>- I cannot believe you invited
the guy to dinner.</i>

01:39.969 --> 01:42.537
It's not even like a thing.
I just met the guy.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.147
- I Just wanted to kind of
hang out with him,

01:44.191 --> 01:45.540
get to know him
a little bit myself.

01:45.583 --> 01:46.932
- Dad, oh, my God. I told you.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.891
I'm not looking
for a relationship right now.

01:48.934 --> 01:52.764
- I'm in a great spot.
I'm loving my life.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.940
I'm not pressuring
a relationship.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.290
I've seen a few people,

01:56.333 --> 01:58.248
but I'm not jumping into
any relationships.

01:58.292 --> 02:01.512
Promised me to be cool.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.124
Don't grill him. Be chill.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.214
- I'll be chill.
I'll wear a sweater.

02:09.085 --> 02:11.870
- I'll ask questions that
you'll want the answers to,

02:11.914 --> 02:13.611
but it will take you
three or four months

02:13.655 --> 02:15.526
to get them.
I'll ask them tonight.

02:15.570 --> 02:18.442
You can just sit back
and just soak it all in.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.923
- Are you sure you want
your dad talking to your fling?

02:20.966 --> 02:22.490
- He's not my fling.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.796
My sisters and my dad are
on the opposite side of this.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.189
No one even asked me.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.625
- Well, we all want
what's best for you.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.845
So whether you marry him
or you hook up with him,

02:29.888 --> 02:31.629
tonight's
going to be fun either way.

02:31.673 --> 02:32.543
- Ugh.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.590
So dramatic.
- Ah!

02:35.633 --> 02:37.287
- I think he's too tall
for Rachel.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.904
- Look at him licking his nuts.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.298
Oh yeah, he'll do it all.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.954
-
What is wrong--Max, stop.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.390
I am literally gagging.

02:59.918 --> 03:02.660
- All right, let's do it.
Come on, girls.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.358
- This way.

03:07.056 --> 03:10.755
- We are going to my star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.844
We might have to fight
the crowd off

03:12.888 --> 03:14.542
just to get next to it.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.935
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

03:16.979 --> 03:19.286
- Yay!
- Pappy.

03:19.329 --> 03:20.852
- Yeah.
- How about that?

03:20.896 --> 03:24.334
Can you believe that?
It actually is pretty cool.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.683
- Dad, this set up so cool.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.077
- I've never been back
to my star.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.515
- You realize what a big deal
it is for Pappy

03:31.559 --> 03:33.909
to have his star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?

03:33.952 --> 03:36.912
That is, like, huge, huge.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.525
- Look what I can do
with my toe.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.223
- That's just great.

03:43.266 --> 03:47.531
You know what? You definitely
got a short attention problem.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.272
- Maybe because I'm
eight years old.

03:54.712 --> 03:55.974
- Come here.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.150
- Come here. Get on my star.
Get on my star.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.543
- I know!
- Get it right here.

03:59.587 --> 04:02.285
Right here. Get down here,
we got to get down.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.287
- Oh, my God.
- Thats what he does.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.071
- There it is.
- Oh, here we go.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.073
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.075
- One, two, three.

04:10.989 --> 04:14.079
- Oh, my God.
- There you are, sweetheart.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.343
Terry Bradshaw!
- Oh, no, they'll believe it.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.083
I'm the star, what can I say?

04:18.127 --> 04:19.737
- I tell you that all the time.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.739
You're Terry Bradshaw.
Everybody knows who you are.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.351
- No, they don't,
but it was really special.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.570
- Thank you.
- Wait, your phone.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.703
- Oh!
- You need your phone.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.661
- Love you all.
- Bye, girl.

04:33.577 --> 04:36.232
- Today, we tour Hollywood.
Are we going up top?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.279
- Yeah!
- This is amazing.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.802
- Keep walking, folks.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.761
Terry Bradshaw is right up
there next to Paul Newman.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.198
- Hello, Bradshaw Bunch.
Welcome to Hollywood.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.852
- Yeah!
- Thank you!

04:47.896 --> 04:50.594
- All my years in Los Angeles,
and I've never done this.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.204
- Coming up,
that's the Chinese Theater,

04:52.248 --> 04:54.903
where the hand and footprints
are of all the celebrities.

04:54.946 --> 04:58.559
Now coming up on your left,
is called Mount Olympus.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.692
- Olympus is where
the gods live.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.607
- You really are smart.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.653
- She'll correct you.
Don't worry about it.

05:08.525 --> 05:11.485
- How's the food, folks?
Fantastic.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.487
- This is fun.
- Look at that.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.532
- They've got little
mechanical bulls inside here.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.012
Oh, I'd love to watch
you ride that, Terry.

05:17.055 --> 05:19.449
- It would be a short ride,
my friend.

05:19.493 --> 05:22.234
- And then a ride
to the hospital.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.149
- How long have you been
doing this tour?

05:24.193 --> 05:25.847
- About 40 minutes.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.722
- We're heading over
towards Beverly Hills now.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.811
- There's the Beverly Wilshire
right there.

05:33.855 --> 05:36.727
Pretty Woman was filmed
right there. Hey, Brian.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.468
- Hey.
- If you get a chance,

05:38.512 --> 05:40.731
pull over.
I want to take these girls

05:40.775 --> 05:42.385
shopping just
for a little bit, all right?

05:42.429 --> 05:43.691
- Not a problem.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.044
- Whoo!
- Cute!

05:49.087 --> 05:50.524
- I'll have some champagne

05:50.567 --> 05:53.353
because I'm planning
on laying some money down.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.442
- Oh, my God. I'm obsessed.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.706
- Hey, babe, come here.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.838
Look how pretty that is.
- I love it.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.666
- Taking that. Lacy? <i></i>

06:02.710 --> 06:06.104

06:06.148 --> 06:08.150
That one right there.
That's Rachel.

06:08.193 --> 06:11.240
- Oh, my God. I'm obsessed.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.633
- Dad! Thank you!
- Erin, of those

06:12.676 --> 06:14.330
that are remaining,
which one do you want?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.679
- The diamond one.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.769
- The diamond heart.
- Dad, thank you.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.032
- To be Terry
Bradshaw's daughter,

06:21.076 --> 06:22.860
he really is
the ultimate girl dad.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.514
- Yeah, he definitely
spoils us and--

06:24.558 --> 06:25.733
- Yes.
- He loves to--

06:25.776 --> 06:26.951
- And we very much
appreciate it.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.039
- Yeah, for sure.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.870
- No, Dad is the best--
he loves shopping for girls.

06:32.914 --> 06:37.135
- Can I see this little bitty
ring for my little Zuri girl?

06:37.179 --> 06:39.573
- Yep.
- Oh, my gosh.

06:39.616 --> 06:40.704
- Oh, my goodness.

- This is gorgeous, babe.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.448
It fits!

06:50.540 --> 06:52.107
I got money rolling out.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.501
I mean, don't you worry.
Pappy's got it.

06:54.544 --> 06:55.937

06:55.980 --> 06:57.634
- Yeah, when you got a rich
daddy, man, you--

06:57.678 --> 06:59.070
- Love you.
- Yeah.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.986
- I enjoy spoiling everybody.
You know that.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.901
Plus, I got to think,
wow, we're going to make

07:03.945 --> 07:05.599
a lot of money on this
"Family Feud" thing.

07:05.642 --> 07:08.558
- Wait, you know that
we don't get the money?

07:08.602 --> 07:10.734
- Why?
- If we win,

07:10.778 --> 07:13.781
the money's donated
to a charity of our choice.

07:13.824 --> 07:16.610
So you're paying
for all this stuff.

07:16.653 --> 07:17.915
- I wish I'd have known that.

07:20.527 --> 07:23.094
- Ooh, pretty.
- Pretty?

07:23.138 --> 07:27.490
- We're like Walmart people,
what we buy, we wear out.

Don't we, girls?
- Yes, sir.

- This is nice.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.160
- Where's Rachel?

07:45.203 --> 07:47.336
- Rachel's bringing the
country music guy.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.338
She's knows what time dinner
is, right?

07:49.381 --> 07:53.255
- I guarantee you, if I don't
like him, he's history.

07:53.298 --> 07:56.867
Because she knows I stay
out of her love life.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.521
- This is staying out
of her love life?

08:00.218 --> 08:02.307

Let's practice, kids.

Name something
that's bigger in Texas.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.052

We've got that book
that's 100 questions--

09:13.640 --> 09:14.684
- Yes!

09:14.728 --> 09:16.425

your future spouse.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.079
- Oh, my God.
- Where's the spotlight?

09:18.122 --> 09:19.428

that drink

09:19.471 --> 09:21.430

are five elements

09:24.128 --> 09:26.609

- Honesty, forthwith-fulness,
stand by-fullness--

09:33.790 --> 09:35.270
- Okay.

09:35.313 --> 09:39.274

Those are the five.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.412
- Hey, Matt, trust me.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.632
We don't want
to run you off, okay?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.547
- But we've been down
this road.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.290
- Family, love you all.
Not you, Dustin.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.508
- You brought me flowers.

09:56.552 --> 09:57.945
- Ho, ho, ho wait.
- What?

09:57.988 --> 09:59.424
- Get back here.

09:59.468 --> 10:02.210
- Hey.
- Way to be late.

10:02.253 --> 10:06.301
- This is our 15th dinner
with strange men.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.346
Trying to cut through
some stuff here.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.871
- Trying to save everybody
some time.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.742
- It is what it is, bub.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.273
- So that was cool.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.667
- I cannot believe my dad
invited you to dinner.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.843
- Tonight was so much fun.
- It's just so crazy.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.324
- You did slide into my DMs,
like, eight months ago.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.021
- That's true, I did,
but in my defense,

10:31.065 --> 10:33.633
you had a song
that was pretty tight.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.287
- Is that all that you were
Instagramming me about?

10:36.331 --> 10:39.334
- I mean, honestly,
it was a lot of how--

10:39.377 --> 10:43.468
I mean, it doesn't hurt
that you're--you know...

10:43.512 --> 10:45.427
but that song was the [BLEEP],
yeah.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.559
- Thanks. <i>
He's super hot,</i>

10:47.603 --> 10:49.605
but I'm trying to take a note
out of my sister's book.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.346
- He's not a husband.
- No.

10:51.389 --> 10:54.697
- Just a temporary thing
for like casual stuff.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.919
- And not take this
too seriously.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.094
We're just having fun.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.183
- Thanks for letting me
hang out.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.228
- It was good.
- It was a blast.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.844
- Let's go back to the hotel.
- I would love that.

11:10.887 --> 11:11.975

11:40.917 --> 11:43.398

- I'm good.

11:43.441 --> 11:46.488
Wow.
- Okay.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.971
- So we were at the bar

11:51.014 --> 11:54.583
and then we were going to watch
a movie up here and--

11:54.626 --> 11:56.454
- That didn't happen.
- We didn't watch a movie.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.282
- Did you, like, make it
through the opening scene?

11:58.326 --> 11:59.544
- We didn't turn the TV
on, actually.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.198
- Oh, didn't even get
to the TV.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.591
Got it.
I'm not sitting on that bed.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.419
- You don't want
to sit on the bed?

12:04.462 --> 12:05.942
- I'm not. I really don't want
to sit here either.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.204
Where--is there
anywhere safe?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.119
The table? The couch?

12:09.163 --> 12:10.555
- Oh, yeah. You can sit there.
Ew...

12:10.599 --> 12:12.166
- Oh, okay, okay, good.
You didn't use this?

12:12.209 --> 12:14.081
- Don't move to the left.
- So what?

12:14.124 --> 12:15.386
Are you going to see him again

12:15.430 --> 12:16.910
or is this, like,
a one time thing?

12:16.953 --> 12:20.304
- Honestly, I'm looking
for a man, just having fun.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.176
- This is a good way
to look at it.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.786
- Never looked at it
that way before.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.484
- I'll ask you again next week,
okay? It might be different.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.486
- All right, "Family Feud,"
here we come.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.141
- Survey says--
- Ding!

12:37.278 --> 12:38.801
- And I'm sure
it's going to be fine, but--

12:38.845 --> 12:40.629
- Sorry...

12:41.804 --> 12:43.327
- I'm sorry?

12:43.371 --> 12:46.417
- Rachel, I don't know
what is happening right now.

12:46.461 --> 12:50.160
I need to take it off vibrate.
I need to turn the sound off,

12:50.204 --> 12:52.989
but you said,
I need to turn off my vibrator.

12:55.252 --> 13:00.127
- Time to play the "Feud."
We're going to crush it.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.216
- Here we go.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.652
- Let's practice a little bit.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.785
- All right, here you go.
Name something

13:05.828 --> 13:07.961
a divorced person
does to get over an ex.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.267
- Find you another one.
- Number one answer.

13:10.311 --> 13:13.749
Name something many politicians
do that's wrong.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.925
- Lie.
- Number one answer.

13:15.969 --> 13:19.494
- Name something that people
seem to do nonstop.

13:19.537 --> 13:20.930
- Talk.
- Exactly. Number one answer.

13:20.974 --> 13:24.891
- Holy cow!
- Dad! You're on fire!

13:24.934 --> 13:28.633
- I got to hold my brain
right where it is.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.113
- He had the cards
in his pocket.

13:30.157 --> 13:33.029
- I did not look at--
hey, I swear to you.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.075
- Dad.
- I did not look at the cards.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.990
- Hopefully all this practice
pays off.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.079
- I mean, last time, we had
zero points on the board up

13:39.122 --> 13:40.254
until the last question.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.125
So I don't think
it could be much worse.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.997
- Okay, talk about a jinx.
Take it back.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.390
- I'm just saying--
- Oh, my gosh.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.654
- Name one rule a father might
have for dating his daughter.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.960
- Keep your hands off of her.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.832
- That's number two.
- Home on time.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.617
- That's number one.
- Wow, girl!

13:55.660 --> 13:58.315
We are violent!
- Dad, you're crazy.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.585
- Hold all my calls, people.

14:10.110 --> 14:13.417
- Here we go.
- All right.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.855
- Hollywood trailers
are different. They're nice.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.552
- They're better than
the NFL days?

14:17.595 --> 14:19.554
- Yeah, you got 30 sweaty guys,
you got--

14:19.597 --> 14:21.034
- Now we just got
one sweaty guy.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.862
- One sweaty--

14:25.386 --> 14:26.996
- Terry Bradshaw.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.782
- "Take that wig off."
You guys are the ringers.

14:30.826 --> 14:31.914
I know you got a plate
in your arm

14:31.958 --> 14:33.089
and you got weak knees,

14:33.133 --> 14:34.656
so just sweep the leg
and I'm good.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.701
I'll leave you on stage.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.442
- No, man.
Don't come after me.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.357
I swear,
I'll try to run from you,

14:40.401 --> 14:42.969
but I'm not promising
I'm going to get away.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.756
- No, I never went to college.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.279
- School of hard knocks.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.414
- Well, I'm known
to be pretty smart.

14:53.457 --> 14:54.806
- Oh, let me tell you this,

14:54.850 --> 14:56.460
I bet he didn't know
how to skin a squirrel.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.594
I'll bet he doesn't know
how to plant corn, raise peas,

14:59.637 --> 15:02.336
chickens, eggs, I do.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.991
I can ride a horse
backwards, forwards,

15:05.034 --> 15:07.036
and I can stand on its back.

15:08.385 --> 15:12.999
That's a lie.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.739
I got a little carried away.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.480
If things get out of hand,

15:16.524 --> 15:18.221
I just want to apologize
right now.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.754
- Okay.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.582
- One, two, three--
- Win!

15:31.626 --> 15:32.932
- All right, good job.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.585
- Pep talk.
- Woot, woot, woot.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.241
- Okay, let's go.
It's game time.

15:38.285 --> 15:41.462
- Game time. Come on.
We got show time here.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.812
<i>It's going to be a great day.</i>

15:43.855 --> 15:46.293
<i>Let's be sharp.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.903
<i>Let's not panic.</i>

15:47.947 --> 15:50.645
<i>Trust yourself, okay?</i>

15:50.688 --> 15:53.343
I want to redeem
the Bradshaw name.

15:53.387 --> 15:57.217
All right, who needs a Xanax?

15:59.610 --> 16:01.351
- Terry Bradshaw, my buddy!
- Yes!

16:01.395 --> 16:02.483
- He's back!

16:02.526 --> 16:04.702
Second time on
"Celebrity Family Feud."

16:04.746 --> 16:05.703
Let's just get it on.
- Let's play a game.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.140
- Let's have a good time.

16:07.183 --> 16:10.708
- So we get on stage
and we started out really well.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.014
- Name something a doctor

16:12.058 --> 16:14.060
asks you to do that
sounds kind of sexy.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.148
- Bend over.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.762
- Take your clothes off.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.242
- Wow!

16:22.285 --> 16:27.290
- But then, things started
going downhill rapidly.

16:27.334 --> 16:30.293
- No pressure, Tammy.
If you dare,

16:30.337 --> 16:34.689
name something about
Superman you might make fun of.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.821
- His shoe.
- Phenomenal.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.475
- The shoe.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.129
- It ain't Steve Harvey's shoes
but they're shoes.

16:40.173 --> 16:43.045
Let's have it, baby.
Number four.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.264
- Oh!

16:44.307 --> 16:46.179
- Me?
- Rachel.

16:46.222 --> 16:51.097
Name something about
Superman you might make fun of.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.013
- His mask?
- What?

16:59.366 --> 17:02.499
- This is when your answer
doesn't have a chance

17:02.543 --> 17:04.327
and the audience goes, what?

17:05.720 --> 17:08.592
- By the end, disaster.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.338
- I want to just...

17:19.081 --> 17:21.692
- I won four Super Bowls,
not you.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.477
- Well, not yet I haven't.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.089
- Look, I said yes to this

17:27.133 --> 17:30.571
because I wanted to redeem
the Bradshaw name, but-

17:30.614 --> 17:32.094
- Somewhat humiliating.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.662
- I didn't think the first time
we were dumb enough,

17:34.705 --> 17:36.707

20:04.420 --> 20:06.161
- Okay.
- You're my ringer, all right?

20:06.205 --> 20:09.033
- How about we get ear pieces
and I'll tell you the answers?

20:09.077 --> 20:10.383
- Oh, I like that!

20:10.426 --> 20:12.298
Already you're thinking
about cheating.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.169
Perfect.
I'm going to call Ira.

20:14.213 --> 20:19.261
<i>♪</i>

20:19.305 --> 20:21.829
- Ira, hey.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.179
We're ready to come back
and play the "Feud."

20:24.223 --> 20:25.485
I got a ringer.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.661
Guess who's sharp as a tack,
quick witted?

20:27.704 --> 20:29.837
- And has good hair.
- And she has good hair.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.274
- Tell Ira that you
shouldn't bring you

20:32.318 --> 20:33.710
because you don't have any hair.

20:33.754 --> 20:37.279
- You got to take me because
I'm the celebrity, okay?

20:37.323 --> 20:39.325
- Well, you might have lost
on "Family Feud,"

20:39.368 --> 20:41.022
but at least in real life,

20:41.065 --> 20:43.590
you know how to choose
the right answer eventually.

20:43.633 --> 20:48.508
- Such as?
- Life, family, love.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.818
- Did I say that out loud?

20:56.385 --> 20:58.518
- Name some place
I'm going to relax.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.084
- You're couch. <i></i>

21:00.128 --> 21:03.349
- Number one answer.
