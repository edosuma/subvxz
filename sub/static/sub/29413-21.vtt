WEBVTT

00:14.492 --> 00:16.625
Oh, Lord, not today.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.844
Hey, Calvin, greetings...

00:18.888 --> 00:21.151
from the future.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.414
Goodbye... from the now.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.329
Just checking out
this sweet ride

00:25.373 --> 00:27.288
to make sure it's
safe for Grover.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.725
Have you fallenon your ass yet?

00:29.768 --> 00:31.292
Not yet.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.685
Oh, well, then,looks like I have a few minutes.

00:33.729 --> 00:38.168
Now, I always test out Grover's
toys before I give them to him.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.561
I've swallowed
every size Lego there is

00:39.604 --> 00:41.345
to make sure
they're not a choking hazard.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.694
Turns out, some of them are.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.568
Dave, I got to get to work,so if you're gonna fall,

00:46.611 --> 00:48.091
you know, let's make it happen.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.745
Actually,

00:49.788 --> 00:52.443
I'm starting
to get the hang of this thing.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.445
It's a lot easier
than it looks!

00:54.489 --> 00:56.360
Whoa, whoa!
Dave, watch out!

00:56.404 --> 00:58.101
Oh!

01:01.496 --> 01:03.454
Hey, man, are you all right?

01:03.498 --> 01:04.890
Yes, but...

01:04.934 --> 01:07.328
Did you see that
idiot out there?

01:07.371 --> 01:09.417
Yeah, that speeding caralmost hit him.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.855
Are you sure you're okay?

01:12.898 --> 01:14.683
Yeah, I'm-I'm
fine, thanks.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.642
Well, good. Well, look,I'm late for work, but, um,

01:17.686 --> 01:19.557
this was totally worth it.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.474
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:23.518 --> 01:24.649
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.744
Oh, hey, Dave.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.616
Hey, Calvin. I need
your signature.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.400
I told you,
I am not autographing

01:36.444 --> 01:38.228
that picture of us at Benihanas.

01:38.272 --> 01:41.188
I'm not here
for that.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.146
But FYI, everyone else
at the table signed it.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.540
Look, I'm sorry, Dave.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.194
I don't want Calvin
signing anything.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.457
I'm still trying to get him outof that damn record club.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.720
Three years and 20 more CDs,

01:51.763 --> 01:53.156
and I'm scot-free.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.769
Well, you know, actually,
after yesterday,

01:57.813 --> 01:59.423
I decided to do something
about all the speeders.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.251
It turns out
there's a new navigation app

02:01.295 --> 02:03.471
that's sending cars downour street to beat the traffic.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.516
You know, I usedone of those things once.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.431
The stupid thing told me

02:07.475 --> 02:09.955
to drive throughsomeone's backyard.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.784
But on the plus side,I saved about three minutes.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.786
Well, you know,

02:14.830 --> 02:17.267
I did some research, and the
city will put in a speed bump

02:17.311 --> 02:19.226
if I get a signature from
everyone on the street.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.488
You're my first stop.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.533
And your last one.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.668
A white guy goingdoor-to-door for signatures

02:26.711 --> 02:27.930
in this neighborhood?

02:27.973 --> 02:30.411
Nice knowing you, Dave.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.413
What Calvin is
trying to say--

02:32.456 --> 02:35.459
people around here are a little
suspicious of getting scammed.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.592
You know? Dwayne Wilson
thought he was signing up

02:37.635 --> 02:39.855
for free HBO
and ended up in the Marines.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.337
Poor bastard just made colonel.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.863
Well, if
door-to-door

02:47.906 --> 02:49.604
isn't gonna work,
what should I do?

02:49.647 --> 02:51.519
Well, first,if you want people

02:51.562 --> 02:52.998
to sign anything around here,

02:53.042 --> 02:55.740
you got to earn their trust.
Mm.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.046
Well, how do I do that?

02:57.089 --> 02:59.004
Well, I mean,
they're all individuals, Dave.

02:59.048 --> 03:02.704
For example,Trey likes to talk about sports

03:02.747 --> 03:05.881
and how paternity tests
can be wrong sometimes.

03:07.796 --> 03:10.494
And Old Miss Kim likestalking about Bingo, her garden

03:10.538 --> 03:13.541
and how her milkshakebrings all the boys to the yard.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.501
And whatever you do,

03:17.545 --> 03:21.288
do not ask Little Hatchet
how she got her nickname.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.681
Or why she got a
divorce, but they're

03:23.725 --> 03:25.770
basically both
the same story.Basically the same story.

03:28.904 --> 03:31.428
Man, it sounds like I've bit offmore than I can chew.

03:31.472 --> 03:34.649
This is that Lego fireman
all over again.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.694
Dave, just invite
everybody over,

03:36.738 --> 03:38.566
give them some food,
and they'll sign.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.742
It'll only work
if you do one thing.

03:41.438 --> 03:44.311
Feed 'em catfish and cornbread.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.747
Why that?

03:45.790 --> 03:47.966
Because that's
what I'm in the mood for.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.499
Hey, G-man,

03:58.542 --> 04:00.065
what are you doing?

04:00.109 --> 04:02.720
Just playing soccer in my head.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.374
Hey, I just scored!

04:05.941 --> 04:08.378
Well, I used to pretendlike that in my head.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.075
Except instead of soccer,it was girls.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.470
Yeah, but you
never scored.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.778
So, why are you just
pretending to play

04:16.821 --> 04:19.084
when you got this whole lawn
right here?

04:19.128 --> 04:20.912
Since my dad almost got hit
by a car,

04:20.956 --> 04:22.740
my mom won't let me play
near the street.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.481
She's being crazy.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.310
No, I just think she's beingcautious and protective.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.964
No, she's being crazy. Watch.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.838
Grover, I told you
to stay on the porch!Whoa!

04:36.145 --> 04:39.061
Wow, Gemma. You got here
before your voice did.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.671
Sorry.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.543
I'm just so worried about
Grover getting hurt.

04:42.586 --> 04:45.110
You know, with all the cars
zipping up and down the street.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.634
Yeah, we get it.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.810
Our mom was afraid of
a lot of stuff, too.

04:48.853 --> 04:51.073
We spent half our childhood
locked up like Grover here

04:51.116 --> 04:53.118
in porch jail.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.425
Yeah, she put us in therefor earthquakes, pit bulls,

04:55.469 --> 04:56.948
that guywith the ice cream truck

04:56.992 --> 04:58.994
that never hadany ice cream.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.914
Well, hey, we are goingto check out the Pasadena fair.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.133
Why don't you let us take
Grover with us?

05:08.177 --> 05:10.571
Can I, Mom, please?

05:10.614 --> 05:12.573
I don't know.

05:12.616 --> 05:15.140
Do you promise notto do anything dangerous?

05:15.184 --> 05:16.620
Oh, absolutely.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.143
I guarantee we will have

05:18.187 --> 05:21.843
a no-fun, danger-free,
super-boring time.

05:21.886 --> 05:25.368
Uh, I'm not sure
I want to go anymore.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.633
Hey, zip it, kid, we're
trying to break you out.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.161
I haven't

05:36.205 --> 05:37.728
seen this much of
the block in one place

05:37.772 --> 05:39.730
since Colonel Wilson
got home from Iraq.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.865
And everyone isloving my food.

05:43.908 --> 05:47.042
No one's even noticed thatthe catfish is actually tofu.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.871
Uh-uh. This ain't right.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.180
Calvin, you were right.This was the perfect way

05:55.224 --> 05:57.748
to get the whole streeton board for the speed bump.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.663
What can I say, Dave?
These are my people.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.056
I love them,
and they love me.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.101
Out of the way, jackass.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.410
Who's that?Oh, that's Walter.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.499
That's the jerk that lives
on the other side of me.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.762
Oh, man, I've never seen him
outside of the house before.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.851
Yeah, because he only
comes out at night,

06:13.895 --> 06:16.419
like bats and vampires.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.466
Well, now that everybody's here,let's... let's get started.

06:19.509 --> 06:24.427
Okay, uh, if I could have
everyone's attention, please.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.952
An easel? Is he gonna talk abouta speed bump or paint one?

06:29.519 --> 06:31.042
Dave lovesgiving presentations.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.566
One time I asked him why,

06:32.609 --> 06:35.960
and he answeredwith a ten-minute presentation.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.572
Okay, now, I don't want to taketoo much of your time,

06:38.615 --> 06:40.138
so I'll just get right to it.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.099
Pasadena.

06:46.623 --> 06:49.496
Jewel of the San Gabriel Valley.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.933
Established in 1874,
but, you know,

06:51.976 --> 06:53.717
oddly, not incorporated until...

06:53.761 --> 06:56.067
How long is this gonna take?

06:57.242 --> 06:59.636
I have plans
with a gentleman tonight,

06:59.680 --> 07:02.987
and I'm hoping
he's not gonna be a gentleman.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.468
LITTLE HATCHET:Yeah.

07:05.512 --> 07:08.689
And I got a cable guy coming
between now and Friday.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.867
Hey, hey, Dave, you-you maywant to speed this up.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.695
Yeah, got it. Okay, uh,

07:14.738 --> 07:16.827
skipping
the Industrial Revolution,

07:16.871 --> 07:19.874
the sinking of the Titanic,
uh, World War I...

07:22.180 --> 07:25.575
The automobile.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.098
I'm out.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.100
It's not worththe free food.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.580
I can come over earlier.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.277
Got to go.

07:32.321 --> 07:34.976
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.
All right, hold up, everybody.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.586
Come on now.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.284
I want to walk out on Dave
just as much as you do,

07:39.328 --> 07:42.287
but he actually has
something important to say.

07:42.331 --> 07:45.639
More important than this sweet
piece of meat right here?

07:49.164 --> 07:51.688
Okay, all right, guys.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.037
Look, we've all seen how fast

07:53.081 --> 07:54.996
these cars have beengoing down our streets.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.780
And I think it's timewe do something about it.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.260
That's true.WOMAN:
You got a point.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.001
That is true.CALVIN:
Hey, come on out here, Dave.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.524
Come on now.
Come on now.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.873
Thank you, Calvin, and, look,

08:02.917 --> 08:05.049
I'll-I'll cut
right to the chase.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.530
To quote Henry Ford...Oh, you know what?

08:07.574 --> 08:10.141
To quote Calvin Butler,if you sign, you can leave.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.323
So, how's thatdeep-fried pickle?

08:18.367 --> 08:21.936
It's pretty
disgusting. Um,

08:21.979 --> 08:23.851
some things should not be
battered and put on a stick.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.595
Ooh, deep-fried butter.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.163
Whoa!Oh.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.731
Can we go
on that roller coaster?

08:34.775 --> 08:35.950
Uh, sorry, little man.
We promised your mom

08:35.993 --> 08:37.342
we wouldn't do
anything dangerous.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.780
And we already pushed our luckwith the petting zoo.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.651
That pygmy goat triedto eat my jacket.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.828
Hey, how about we go
on the Ferris wheel?

08:44.872 --> 08:48.179
Ferris wheel?
That's the lamest ride here.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.181
Well, we can go back
to the bounce house.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.706
And if you promiseto be careful,

08:52.749 --> 08:55.752
this timewe'll let you jump.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.581
Fine, we'll go
on the stupid Ferris wheel.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.974
But you guys are boring.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.979
That kid's not as cute
as he used to be.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.809
Thank you.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.201
Oh, thank you so much.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.682
Yeah, good.Oh, here you go.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.379
Now, you surethis not for the Marines?

09:14.423 --> 09:16.381
Hmm.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.775
You'd be a lot safer
joining the Marines

09:18.819 --> 09:20.864
than going over to
Miss Kim's tonight.

09:22.866 --> 09:25.216
I know. Pray for me.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.308
Hey, thanks for
backing me up, Calvin.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.093
Everyone's signing
the petition.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.834
Well, nothing'smore important to me

09:33.877 --> 09:35.400
than the safetyof our neighborhood.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.402
I'll do anythingto protect these kids.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.100
Oh, hey, Walter.
If you could just sign

09:39.143 --> 09:40.405
on the last spot
right there.

09:40.449 --> 09:43.060
Oh, yeah, I'd...I-I'd be happy to

09:43.104 --> 09:46.890
if Calvin finally agrees to movehis fence off of my property.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.850
Well, Dave, we tried.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.994
Hey, Calvin, what
was that all about?

10:04.038 --> 10:08.216
That fool thinks my fence issix inches onto his property.

10:08.259 --> 10:11.611
Is it?Whose side are you on, Dave?

10:12.916 --> 10:15.005
Calvin, Walter's
the last signature we need

10:15.049 --> 10:16.659
to get the speed bump.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.748
Look, that fence has been theresince I moved in,

10:18.792 --> 10:20.271
and I'm not moving it now.

10:20.315 --> 10:23.274
Plus, if I give in to him once,it won't stop there.

10:23.318 --> 10:26.974
I'm telling you, Dave,
kindness is a slippery slope.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.717
Well, okay, Calvin,
that's not true.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.284
Oh, yes, it is.
I said hello to you once,

10:33.328 --> 10:35.025
and look at us now.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.246
Okay, well, if you won't move,

10:38.289 --> 10:39.726
then how are we gonna get
the speed bump?

10:39.769 --> 10:42.946
Oh, that's easy.
Gonna wait for him to die.

10:42.990 --> 10:46.167
Hey, besides, I got youall those other signatures.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.777
Yeah, which mean
absolutely nothing

10:47.821 --> 10:49.300
if we don't get Walter's.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.911
Well, I'm sorry, Dave.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.826
If it makes you feel any better,

10:52.869 --> 10:55.219
I'll sign the picture
of us at Benihana.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.439
It's too late.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.136
I already forged it.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.186
Ha-ha!

11:05.229 --> 11:06.753
Wow! What a view!

11:06.796 --> 11:08.885
Yeah, check this
out, little man.

11:08.929 --> 11:11.192
You can see everything
from up here.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.498
Like how much fun
they're having over there

11:13.542 --> 11:15.718
on the roller coaster!

11:15.762 --> 11:17.198
Are you kidding?

11:17.241 --> 11:18.808
That doesn't looklike much fun at all.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.245
We are totally coming back heretomorrow.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.857
Whoa!
Whoa!

11:23.900 --> 11:25.162
Whoa!Hey, now, hey!

11:25.206 --> 11:26.337
What just happened?

11:26.381 --> 11:27.687
Uh, I don't know.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.819
Hey, maybe they're
just letting more riders on.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.081
Uh, or...

11:31.125 --> 11:32.517
maybe the motorjust caught on fire,

11:32.561 --> 11:35.129
and the operator triedto put it out with his beer!

11:35.172 --> 11:36.957
Seriously?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.176
Hey, hey, look, it's
okay, little man.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.396
All right? Everything
is gonna be fine.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.963
It's not fine.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.355
It's awesome!

11:44.399 --> 11:46.009
What? Oh!Finally, some realfun.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.142
Whoa!No!

11:52.146 --> 11:53.756
Calvin Butler.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.845
What is wrong with you?

11:55.889 --> 11:57.455
I would say nothing,
but I'm sure

11:57.499 --> 11:59.066
you're about
to tell me different.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.112
You're damn right I am.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.201
Dave just told mewhat happened.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.029
I cannot believe
after all of these years

12:06.073 --> 12:08.031
you're still fighting
over that stupid fence.

12:08.075 --> 12:11.208
Why does Walter care so much
about six inches?

12:11.252 --> 12:12.862
Well, why do you care so much?

12:12.906 --> 12:14.429
It's six inches.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.911
Is it about the money?

12:17.954 --> 12:20.391
I mean, it can't bethat expensive to move a fence.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.393
No, it's not about that.
It's about the principle.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.178
And it's like
my father always said:

12:24.221 --> 12:27.007
"A man's fence is
a man's fence."

12:27.050 --> 12:29.574
When did your father say that?

12:29.618 --> 12:31.968
Whose side are you on, Tina?

12:32.012 --> 12:34.231
Is your pridemore important

12:34.275 --> 12:37.060
than the safety of the kids
in this neighborhood?

12:37.104 --> 12:40.063
Nah, babe. Don't try to make
this whole speed bump thing

12:40.107 --> 12:41.543
about safety.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.329
Okay...

12:45.373 --> 12:47.418
when Malcolm and
Marty were little,

12:47.462 --> 12:50.247
you did everything in your
power to keep them safe.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.467
You even used
to make Marty wear a helmet

12:52.510 --> 12:54.469
just to play hide-and-seek.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.167
I made him wear that thingall the time.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.517
The kid had no balance.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.302
Okay.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.826
When Malcolm said
that he was old enough

13:03.870 --> 13:06.524
to take his bike to the park,
you followed him in your car

13:06.568 --> 13:08.439
just to make sure
he got there safely.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.571
I had to.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.921
He was pulling Marty in a wagon.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.402
That boy fell out
every two blocks.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.189
Come on, babe.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.495
You love Grover.

13:21.626 --> 13:25.108
Doesn't he deserve to be
just as safe as our boys were?

13:26.153 --> 13:27.589
Yeah, I guess.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.114
That's my big papa bear.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.508
Taking careof all the little cubs.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.903
Yeah, you know me, huh?

13:36.946 --> 13:38.948
Always looking out for
the neighborhood kids.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.254
Mmm.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.603
Oh. You know what?What?

13:41.646 --> 13:43.257
That gives me an idea.What?

13:43.300 --> 13:46.086
I can underpay them
to move the fence.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.092
Yeah!

13:53.702 --> 13:56.052
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You have got
to cut that out, little man.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.967
You have got to stop.

13:58.011 --> 14:01.841
This rocking is not helpingthat deep-fried pizza stay down.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.627
What? When did you eat that?

14:05.670 --> 14:08.151
When you guys were
in the bathroom.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.501
You two are no fun.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.503
You're just as bad as my mom.

14:12.547 --> 14:15.115
Hey, look, don't be
so hard on her, okay?

14:15.158 --> 14:16.986
She just wants
to keep you safe.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.554
Why? I'm not a baby.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.295
Yeah, I know.
The only reason

14:21.338 --> 14:23.297
your mom is so
overprotective

14:23.340 --> 14:25.952
is because of how much
she cares about you.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.171
Yeah, i-if you see a kid
having too much fun,

14:28.215 --> 14:30.217
that means
his mom doesn't love him.

14:31.609 --> 14:34.264
So, that kid
in front of the roller coaster

14:34.308 --> 14:36.571
with his hands
up in the air...

14:36.614 --> 14:39.922
You mean the one eating that
corn dog with no shirt on?

14:39.966 --> 14:42.969
Yeah. His mama
don't even know he's here.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.276
Wow. That's sad.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.930
Exactly.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.933
So every time your mom
tells you, stop running,

14:50.977 --> 14:53.283
tie your shoes,
or be careful,

14:53.327 --> 14:56.547
what she's really saying
is she loves you.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.072
I guess I'm pretty lucky.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.943
You sure are.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.946
Which means she's gonna besuper mad when she finds out

15:03.990 --> 15:05.295
you got me stuck up here.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.516
Uh, no, she won't,
no, she won't.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.735
Because we're fine.
Right, Marty?

15:10.779 --> 15:12.259
Yeah, yeah.
We-We're-we're totally safe.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.564
This kind of thing happens
all the time.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.090
Oh, thank you, Jesus!Ah, we are gonna live!

15:19.222 --> 15:21.659
Thanks so much for
doing this, Calvin.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.574
Did Tina change
your mind?

15:23.618 --> 15:26.403
No. I was alwaysgonna do it.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.449
I just needed to knowhow committed youwere.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.974
Well, you're doing
the right thing,

15:32.018 --> 15:34.020
and I, for one,
appreciate it.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.065
Do youappreciate it enough

15:36.109 --> 15:38.459
to give me six incheson yourproperty?

15:38.502 --> 15:40.069
Sorry, Calvin.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.984
It's like my dad
used to say:

15:42.028 --> 15:43.943
"A man's fence is
a man's fence."

15:47.381 --> 15:49.644
Damn. You're not Miss Kim.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.604
Look, Walter, I need
to talk to you.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.476
Oh, wha-what are you here
to steal now?

15:55.519 --> 15:57.130
My Wi-Fi password?

15:57.173 --> 15:58.479
I'll give youa hint.

15:58.522 --> 16:01.743
It's "Calvin"
and four other letters.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.485
Look, man,

16:04.528 --> 16:07.618
I just came over here to say
if you sign Dave's petition,

16:07.662 --> 16:09.577
I'll move the damn fence.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.319
Great. I was waiting
for you to die.

16:13.624 --> 16:16.018
Walter, I really appreciate it.

16:16.062 --> 16:19.979
Just sign right under where Treywrote "Not joining Marines."

16:20.849 --> 16:22.503
Okay.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.635
But actually,
since it took you this long,

16:24.679 --> 16:27.116
maybe I should charge you
a little interest.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.640
How about we move that fence
a full foot?

16:29.684 --> 16:31.033
What?

16:31.077 --> 16:33.122
I got a full
foot for you.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.645
You know...Oh, okay, all right, all right.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.038
Calvin, calm down.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.518
We need that speed bump.
Please.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.608
All right. But
this ain't for you.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.132
This is for the kids.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.178
Well, in that case,
let's move it two feet--

16:45.221 --> 16:47.484
one for me and one for the kids.

16:47.528 --> 16:50.183
Oh, to hell with you!

16:50.226 --> 16:52.750
You know what, I can't believeyou're trying to pull this crap,

16:52.794 --> 16:55.188
after all the stuff I let you
slide with over the years.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.059
What have you let slide?

16:57.103 --> 16:58.278
Are you kidding me?

16:58.321 --> 17:01.194
Do you know how many
of your old roof tiles

17:01.237 --> 17:03.283
have flown over into my yard?

17:03.326 --> 17:06.068
And what about the
floodlights you put up?

17:06.112 --> 17:08.418
They're just shining bright
all night in my bedroom.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.160
Every time I get up
to go to the bathroom,

17:11.204 --> 17:13.032
it feels like a prison break.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.123
Not my problem.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.212
A-Actually,
Walter, it is.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.170
According to the
Pasadena Zoning Manual,

17:21.214 --> 17:24.478
those are both residential
C-1 violations.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.566
So?

17:25.609 --> 17:27.307
So, if the city
inspector finds out,

17:27.350 --> 17:30.527
you're staring down the barrel
of some pretty hefty fines.

17:30.571 --> 17:31.702
He is?

17:31.746 --> 17:34.444
You are.

17:36.185 --> 17:39.319
Yeah, you know, and now that I'mlooking around, there's no way

17:39.362 --> 17:41.712
that this half-saddle door
threshold is up to code.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.324
And don't even get me started
on the enclosed breezeway,

17:44.367 --> 17:48.110
which is clearly within fivefeet of a multi-person dwelling.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.767
Do not get him started
on breezeways.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.119
Well, hold on, now, we don't
have to get into all of that.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.555
You're right, we don't.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.818
Because you're gonna
sign that petition,

18:00.862 --> 18:03.604
and we're gonna put up a speed
bump to protect these kids.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.432
Are we clear?

18:05.475 --> 18:07.390
Crystal, baby.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.396
Fine. You win.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.531
But that catfish
at your party sucked.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.100
Give me my pen.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.234
Damn, Dave,that was gangsta, man.

18:25.278 --> 18:28.237
Yeah, you want to hear
something even more gangsta?

18:28.281 --> 18:30.370
I just made all
that stuff up.

18:30.413 --> 18:30.805
I don't even know
what a breezeway is.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.684
This is so great.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.296
That speed bump is really gonna
slow people down around here.

18:43.339 --> 18:46.255
Yeah, and it's short enoughthat I could just zip around it.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.607
Mom, does this mean
I can play outside again?

18:50.651 --> 18:52.740
Yes. But not near the street,

18:52.783 --> 18:56.178
not after dark,
and never without supervision.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.875
I love you, too.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.749
Can I go inside
and play on my iPad?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.490
Okay.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.146
What was I thinking?
He could get carpal tunnel.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.976
Look at that
speed bump.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.630
Isn't she
beautiful?

19:13.674 --> 19:16.851
Yeah. It reminds me of you.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.287
Mm.Black,

19:18.331 --> 19:19.680
curvy...

19:19.723 --> 19:22.335
and makes me want to slow
down and take my time.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.510
Oh...

19:25.251 --> 19:27.949
Oh, now I'm gonna feel guilty
every time I run over it.

19:29.211 --> 19:32.301
But, seriously, you did a
good thing for the community.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.216
You should be proud
of yourself.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.305
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.960
Because I've
decided...

19:39.961 --> 19:41.615
I'm not stopping here.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.231
What do you think?

19:49.275 --> 19:50.711
You're running for city council?

19:50.754 --> 19:52.582
Yeah.You're kidding, right?

19:52.626 --> 19:54.236
Nope. You know,
getting this done

19:54.280 --> 19:55.977
really woke up
my sense of civic duty.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.762
Plus, I've always wanted to seemy face on a button.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.375
So, if you win,

20:02.418 --> 20:05.291
won't that mean you'll be super
busy doing government stuff

20:05.334 --> 20:09.251
and won't have the time to
hang around here as much?

20:09.295 --> 20:10.600
I'm afraid so.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.646
Hmm.
Well, in
that case,

20:12.689 --> 20:13.951
you got myvote.
