00:17.680 --> 00:18.940
<i>Peter: I'll never forget that</i>

00:19.040 --> 00:21.100
<i>first meeting with Stephen</i>

00:21.200 --> 00:24.920
in the parking lot of
the Holiday Inn in Chicago.

00:26.840 --> 00:30.020
<i>A small compact car kind of</i>
<i>pulled into the parking lot.</i>

00:30.120 --> 00:32.780
<i>Someone got out,</i>
<i>went back to the trunk</i>

00:32.880 --> 00:35.580
and took out this
collapsible wheelchair.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.340
Suddenly, this wheelchair
kind of spun to life,

00:38.440 --> 00:40.820
spun around literally
did a 360

00:40.920 --> 00:43.140
and took off across
the parking lot.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.740
I guess I opened my door at that
point and this young man said

00:46.840 --> 00:48.540
"Uh, Peter Guzzardi,
is-- is that you?"

00:48.640 --> 00:51.060
"Is that Peter Guzzardi?"
And I said, "Yes, it's me."

00:51.160 --> 00:53.980
And he said, "Well,
that's Professor Hawking."

00:54.080 --> 00:56.600
"And we've gotta go,
we've gotta go after him."

01:03.240 --> 01:05.420
So, I-- I start
to blather a little bit.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.020
It's like, "How are you
Professor Hawking?"

01:08.120 --> 01:09.540
"It's wonderful to meet you."

01:09.640 --> 01:12.780
<i>And then there was</i>
<i>this-- this kind of silence.</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:17.300
<i>Stephen Started</i>
<i>to emit sounds</i>

01:17.400 --> 01:20.660
<i>and the graduate student</i>
<i>translated.</i>

01:20.760 --> 01:24.380
What-- what this young man
said to me was,

01:24.480 --> 01:27.340
"Where's the contract?"

01:27.440 --> 01:31.940
All that came to mind was,
you know, like, "Uh-oh!"

01:32.040 --> 01:34.980
This is not gonna be easy.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.940
The book about scientific theory

01:37.040 --> 01:39.260
has been a top best seller.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.780
<i>Woman on TV: It's called</i>
<i>"A Brief History Of Time"</i>

01:40.880 --> 01:42.540
<i>and it was written by</i>
<i>a remarkable scientist</i>

01:42.640 --> 01:44.780
<i>named Stephen Hawking.</i>

01:44.880 --> 01:47.060
<i>Man on TV: The man</i>
<i>often compared to Galileo,</i>

01:47.160 --> 01:49.160
<i>Einstein and Newton.</i>

01:50.240 --> 01:54.140
<i>Peter: Stephen really</i>
<i>was this strong willed man</i>

01:54.240 --> 01:56.060
who was singularly focused

01:56.160 --> 01:58.420
on what he wanted to accomplish

01:58.520 --> 02:01.580
and was gonna move
Heaven and Earth to do it.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.580
Soon it will have
been in the best seller list

02:04.680 --> 02:07.800
longer than any other
book in history.

02:09.480 --> 02:11.860
<i>Lucy: Who knows</i>
<i>what else he would have done.</i>

02:11.960 --> 02:13.740
<i>What else would he have</i>
<i>achieved if he hadn't had</i>

02:13.840 --> 02:15.840
<i>motor neurone disease.</i>

02:16.560 --> 02:19.260
<i>All the time</i>
<i>I knew my father...</i>

02:19.360 --> 02:22.980
he was 24 hours off dying.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.400
Um, the fact that it didn't
happen is a miracle.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.600
<i>Stephen: Can you hear me?</i>

02:42.600 --> 02:46.400
<i>I was 20 in October 1962.</i>

02:49.240 --> 02:53.600
<i>I had moved to Cambridge</i>
<i>to undertake my Ph.D.</i>

02:55.440 --> 02:58.980
<i>It was a very cold winter</i>
<i>and my mother persuaded me</i>

02:59.080 --> 03:02.840
<i>to go skating on</i>
<i>the lake in St. Albans.</i>

03:04.360 --> 03:07.180
<i>I fell over and had</i>
<i>great difficulty</i>

03:07.280 --> 03:09.400
<i>getting up again.</i>

03:12.960 --> 03:15.340
<i>My mother realised</i>
<i>something was wrong</i>

03:15.440 --> 03:18.220
<i>and took me to the doctor.</i>

03:18.320 --> 03:20.180
<i>Mary: Stephen was first</i>
<i>diagnosed</i>

03:20.280 --> 03:21.740
<i> with the motor neurone disease</i>

03:21.840 --> 03:24.940
shortly after
his 21st birthday.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.780
Stephen ended up
in St. Bartholomew's hospital

03:28.880 --> 03:30.340
where I was...

03:30.440 --> 03:32.840
a pre clinical student.

03:35.560 --> 03:40.580
The prognosis he was given was
a maximum of three years

03:40.680 --> 03:44.300
with a rapid deterioration
before then.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.180
<i>Stephen: At first</i>
<i>I became depressed.</i>

03:47.280 --> 03:51.540
<i>There didn't seem any point</i>
<i>working on my Ph.D.</i>

03:51.640 --> 03:53.540
<i>because I didn't know</i>
<i>if I would</i>

03:53.640 --> 03:56.520
<i> live long enough to finish it.</i>

03:57.840 --> 03:59.140
<i>Ammar: Professor Hawking</i>
<i>was diagnosed</i>

03:59.240 --> 04:00.860
<i>in the early 1960's.</i>

04:00.960 --> 04:04.540
<i>There was no treatment</i>
<i>that could prolong survival.</i>

04:04.640 --> 04:07.480
<i>That is essentially</i>
<i>a death sentence.</i>

04:10.160 --> 04:11.260
<i>The nerve cells controlling</i>

04:11.360 --> 04:14.340
<i>the muscle movement die off.</i>

04:14.440 --> 04:16.940
Eventually, the patients
lose the ability to walk,

04:17.040 --> 04:21.440
to use their arms, to speak,
to swallow or to breathe.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.860
<i>Most people feel very,</i>
<i>very low.</i>

04:28.960 --> 04:31.100
<i>And some people find it</i>
<i>very difficult to come out</i>

04:31.200 --> 04:34.200
<i>of that in a positive</i>
<i>state of mind at all.</i>

04:36.040 --> 04:39.520
<i>Stephen: While there</i>
<i>is life, there is hope.</i>

04:40.760 --> 04:43.780
<i>I had come to Cambridge</i>
<i>to do Cosmology</i>

04:43.880 --> 04:47.400
<i>and Cosmology I was</i>
<i>determined to do.</i>

05:01.880 --> 05:04.940
<i>Mary: Stephen was</i>
<i>always one for puzzles.</i>

05:05.040 --> 05:09.800
Wanting to... work out
the logic of things.

05:11.680 --> 05:16.060
<i>Stephen: I had a passionate</i>
<i>interest in model trains.</i>

05:16.160 --> 05:20.400
<i>I was always very interested</i>
<i>in how things operated.</i>

05:21.680 --> 05:23.340
<i>And used to take them apart</i>

05:23.440 --> 05:25.440
<i>to see how they worked.</i>

05:26.800 --> 05:29.540
<i>My aim was always</i>
<i>to build working models</i>

05:29.640 --> 05:31.920
<i>that I could control.</i>

05:34.560 --> 05:37.580
<i>If you understand</i>
<i>how the universe operates</i>

05:37.680 --> 05:40.280
<i>you control it in a way.</i>

05:41.720 --> 05:46.400
<i>Mary: All scientific laws</i>
<i>are hypothesis.</i>

05:48.360 --> 05:52.140
The mathematical rules
that will tell you

05:52.240 --> 05:56.440
<i>how other things will behave.</i>

06:01.840 --> 06:05.900
<i>Stephen was always</i>
<i>looking for the rules</i>

06:06.000 --> 06:08.400
<i>that would let him win.</i>

06:16.280 --> 06:20.660
<i>Stephen: I began to make</i>
<i>progress in my work.</i>

06:20.760 --> 06:24.020
<i>There was also a young woman</i>
<i>called Jane</i>

06:24.120 --> 06:27.460
<i>whom I had met at a party.</i>

06:27.560 --> 06:30.880
It makes me laugh even
to think of him now.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.060
<i>Jane: I was an undergraduate</i>

06:36.160 --> 06:38.700
<i>in London at the time.</i>

06:38.800 --> 06:43.060
I was drawn by his sense of
humour and his wide smile.

06:43.160 --> 06:47.540
<i>And he had his beautiful</i>
<i>grey-blue eyes.</i>

06:47.640 --> 06:50.620
<i>I thought he was so clever.</i>

06:50.720 --> 06:53.460
He had his own
particular charm...

06:53.560 --> 06:56.220
which was very attractive.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.500
Conversations were

06:57.600 --> 06:59.180
always entertaining,

06:59.280 --> 07:01.020
always funny, and Stephen

07:01.120 --> 07:03.240
always had the last word.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.860
<i>He had a romantic side,</i>

07:06.960 --> 07:10.500
<i>as he invited me</i>
<i>to May Ball in Trinity Hall</i>

07:10.600 --> 07:12.600
<i>soon after we met.</i>

07:13.640 --> 07:16.800
<i>And that's a very romantic</i>
<i>thing to do.</i>

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
That was fun.

07:22.560 --> 07:28.180
<i>Mary: My family had</i>
<i>considerable reservations.</i>

07:28.280 --> 07:30.100
<i>Your son gets terminally ill</i>

07:30.200 --> 07:33.180
and suddenly introduces
a girl that's

07:33.280 --> 07:35.660
someone he wants
to get married to.

07:35.760 --> 07:39.060
It doesn't sound like
a very good

07:39.160 --> 07:41.300
basis for a marriage,

07:41.400 --> 07:43.860
<i>and does the girl know</i>

07:43.960 --> 07:46.200
<i>what she's letting herself</i>
<i>in for?</i>

07:48.440 --> 07:50.460
<i>Jane: We were in love</i>
<i>with each other</i>

07:50.560 --> 07:51.820
and I thought to myself,

07:51.920 --> 07:54.340
"Well, really he may have

07:54.440 --> 07:56.440
only two years to live."

07:59.320 --> 08:01.500
<i>But this was in the '60s,</i>

08:01.600 --> 08:04.760
<i>"I might have only</i>
<i>four minutes to live."</i>

08:10.960 --> 08:13.500
<i>John F. Kennedy: This latest</i>
<i>Soviet threat</i>

08:13.600 --> 08:16.680
must and will be met
with determination.

08:18.640 --> 08:22.940
Nobody knew when the next
confrontation was going to be

08:23.040 --> 08:24.860
which could lead
to a nuclear war

08:24.960 --> 08:28.520
and we would have
four minutes warning of that.

08:44.840 --> 08:51.200
<i>Jane: July the 15th, 1965.</i>

08:52.720 --> 08:55.860
<i>It was a very happy day</i>
<i>and a very beautiful day.</i>

08:55.960 --> 08:59.360
<i>We were married in the chapel</i>
<i>in Trinity Hall...</i>

09:00.640 --> 09:04.280
<i>where he was</i>
<i>a post graduate student.</i>

09:09.840 --> 09:14.440
From the outside,
Jane's decision was most unwise.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.920
But it was Jane's decision.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.700
<i>Lucy: One thing</i>
<i>that always strikes me</i>

09:21.800 --> 09:24.140
<i>is the courage</i>
<i>of both my parents.</i>

09:24.240 --> 09:25.540
It's quite extraordinary

09:25.640 --> 09:27.260
when you think of
what happened to those two,

09:27.360 --> 09:32.460
probably rather naive,
quite innocent 21 year olds.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.920
<i>Nobody could have foreseen</i>
<i>what lay ahead of them.</i>

09:39.240 --> 09:42.620
We set off for New York state...

09:42.720 --> 09:45.420
for a physics conference.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.600
<i> That was really our honeymoon.</i>

09:49.000 --> 09:53.940
It was almost as if everything
had to be sacrificed

09:54.040 --> 09:58.320
to what I call the worship
of the Goddess of physics.

10:01.040 --> 10:05.460
<i>Roger: When I first</i>
<i> encountered Stephen Hawking...</i>

10:05.560 --> 10:10.540
it was a kind of lazy
journalistic cliche to say

10:10.640 --> 10:15.400
that he was a new Einstein
or the new Newton.

10:19.280 --> 10:24.380
<i>But certainly even right</i>
<i> at the outset of his career...</i>

10:24.480 --> 10:26.540
<i>Stephen Hawking wasn't</i>
<i>just thinking big,</i>

10:26.640 --> 10:28.820
he wasn't just
thinking enormous,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.620
he was thinking cosmic,

10:30.720 --> 10:32.760
about the whole universe.

10:39.720 --> 10:43.740
<i>Stephen: The big question in</i>
<i>cosmology in the early '60s</i>

10:43.840 --> 10:47.380
<i>was "Did the universe</i>
<i>have a beginning?"</i>

10:47.480 --> 10:49.820
<i>Roger: Stephen</i>
<i>really started thinking</i>

10:49.920 --> 10:54.640
<i> about the birth of the universe</i>
<i>in mathematical form.</i>

10:57.440 --> 10:59.540
<i>Stephen: I showed that</i>
<i>the universe had to have</i>

10:59.640 --> 11:02.220
<i>had a beginning...</i>

11:02.320 --> 11:05.200
<i> in the singularity or Big Bang.</i>

11:09.400 --> 11:12.700
<i>Roger: The Big Bang theory is</i>
<i>a really extraordinary idea</i>

11:12.800 --> 11:14.660
you know, you look
around the universe

11:14.760 --> 11:17.740
look around your surroundings
and the thought that you,

11:17.840 --> 11:21.740
your house, the Earth,
the solar system,

11:21.840 --> 11:23.940
<i>everything you can see</i>
<i>was packed into this</i>

11:24.040 --> 11:29.360
<i>unimaginably small space</i>
<i>is an extraordinary thought.</i>

11:42.840 --> 11:45.780
<i>Jane: Survival... and physics</i>

11:45.880 --> 11:50.800
<i>were the prime motivators</i>
<i>in his life.</i>

11:51.840 --> 11:54.460
Plus his children.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.020
<i>Mary: When Robert came along</i>
<i>that was a surprise.</i>

11:57.120 --> 11:59.580
<i>They hadn't been</i>
<i>married that long.</i>

11:59.680 --> 12:02.380
<i>And the normal pattern</i>
<i>at that time</i>

12:02.480 --> 12:04.700
was to have your family when

12:04.800 --> 12:07.640
you had a secure income
to support them.

12:09.440 --> 12:14.300
<i>But Stephen obviously,</i>
<i>didn't have time.</i>

12:14.400 --> 12:16.020
<i>Robert: My father would</i>
<i>sometimes be</i>

12:16.120 --> 12:19.060
deep in thought about
whatever topic was on his mind,

12:19.160 --> 12:20.380
whether that was
scientific or not.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.260
And so, sometimes it would be

12:22.360 --> 12:23.860
hard to get his attention.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.500
But that's I think sometimes

12:25.600 --> 12:28.520
can be the case
for most fathers.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.660
<i>He wanted to be</i>
<i>involved as a father</i>

12:35.760 --> 12:38.220
but his disability meant that

12:38.320 --> 12:41.260
he wasn't involved
in some things that

12:41.360 --> 12:43.740
normally as a father would be.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.220
<i>Jane: He very rarely</i>
<i>spoke about his illness</i>

12:46.320 --> 12:50.700
but when he did, he said that
the advantage of his illness

12:50.800 --> 12:54.620
was that he was able to devote
himself 100 percent

12:54.720 --> 12:56.460
to his work.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.140
He didn't have
to change nappies,

12:58.240 --> 12:59.500
he didn't have
to make cups of tea,

12:59.600 --> 13:01.380
he didn't have to cook meals.

13:01.480 --> 13:07.400
But he could just get on
with concentrating on physics.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.740
<i>He started using a wheelchair</i>
<i>shortly after Lucy was born.</i>

13:13.840 --> 13:17.580
<i>Lucy sat on Stephen's knee.</i>

13:17.680 --> 13:20.180
Robert trotted along beside

13:20.280 --> 13:22.520
and I pushed from behind.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.380
<i>Lucy: By the time I was born,</i>

13:28.480 --> 13:32.400
my father had already outlived
his life expectancy.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.500
<i>I think my father</i>
<i>really loved being a dad</i>

13:38.600 --> 13:39.860
<i>but I think</i>
<i>my father's disability</i>

13:39.960 --> 13:43.420
<i>did impinge greatly</i>
<i>on my childhood.</i>

13:43.520 --> 13:45.420
This was the '70s and the '80s.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.860
Disabled access to buildings
just wasn't a thing.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.860
There weren't even
dropped pavements.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.180
I mean, it was really hard.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.980
Your whole day could be thrown
off course

13:53.080 --> 13:54.500
by a flight of steps.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.540
Even just a couple of
steps could just ruin

13:56.640 --> 13:58.900
whatever it was
you were trying to do.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.780
And so it made things
like holidays, it made outings,

14:01.880 --> 14:04.340
<i>it made all</i>
<i>the kind of fun stuff...</i>

14:04.440 --> 14:08.540
<i>unpredictable and liable</i>
<i>to be blown off course</i>

14:08.640 --> 14:12.580
<i>by circumstances completely</i>
<i>beyond your control.</i>

14:12.680 --> 14:16.220
<i>Robert: That-- that stage</i>
<i> my father still slept upstairs</i>

14:16.320 --> 14:20.420
<i>and so every night he had</i>
<i> to make his way up the stairs.</i>

14:20.520 --> 14:23.980
That was quite
a-- an interesting challenge.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.180
<i>He was very determined.</i>

14:26.280 --> 14:30.060
<i>In the house, there's still</i>
<i>handles screwed in the wall</i>

14:30.160 --> 14:34.360
which he used to pull
himself up the stairs.

14:37.160 --> 14:41.540
<i>Jane: Here Stephen</i>
<i>made a great discovery,</i>

14:41.640 --> 14:44.540
<i> into the nature of black holes.</i>

14:44.640 --> 14:47.460
<i>Stephen was sitting</i>
<i>on one side of the bed,</i>

14:47.560 --> 14:49.740
<i>slowly getting himself ready,</i>

14:49.840 --> 14:52.460
taking off his clothes,
putting on his pyjamas.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.700
I was sitting on the
other side of the bed

14:55.800 --> 14:59.720
and Stephen was, obviously,
deep in thought...

15:02.080 --> 15:05.020
<i>then Stephen announced...</i>

15:05.120 --> 15:08.600
a great new idea in physics.

15:09.960 --> 15:14.620
<i>Those were the happiest</i>
<i>days of our lives.</i>

15:14.720 --> 15:18.540
<i>Our children were</i>
<i>an absolute joy...</i>

15:18.640 --> 15:21.900
<i>but his mind was</i>
<i>always on physics.</i>

15:25.120 --> 15:26.540
It was February the 14th,

15:26.640 --> 15:29.300
Valentine's day, 1974

15:29.400 --> 15:30.980
I drove him over to Oxford

15:31.080 --> 15:32.940
<i>in pouring rain.</i>

15:33.040 --> 15:35.440
<i>Stephen was giving a paper.</i>

15:36.440 --> 15:38.980
He was saying that Black Holes,

15:39.080 --> 15:42.140
which previously
had been assumed

15:42.240 --> 15:43.980
not to emit

15:44.080 --> 15:45.420
anything at all,

15:45.520 --> 15:48.860
could actually radiate energy.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.880
And there was a stunned silence.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.140
<i>Jim: Stephen was using</i>
<i>his intuition</i>

15:57.240 --> 15:59.280
<i>and his imagination.</i>

16:06.000 --> 16:10.840
There are these really weird
objects called Black holes...

16:14.040 --> 16:16.460
<i>but Stephen discovered</i>

16:16.560 --> 16:18.420
<i>that Black Holes</i>
<i>are no longer black,</i>

16:18.520 --> 16:21.320
<i>that they can</i>
<i>spit out particles.</i>

16:23.040 --> 16:25.340
I like to call
this the sizzling of space,

16:25.440 --> 16:27.760
it's like sizzling bacon.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.300
<i>Stephen: I had</i>
<i>discovered a concept</i>

16:34.400 --> 16:36.840
<i>that is now named after me,</i>

16:37.680 --> 16:39.920
<i>"Hawking Radiation."</i>

16:42.240 --> 16:47.520
<i> My discovery was actually very</i>
<i>controversial at the time.</i>

16:50.680 --> 16:53.620
Most people said, "This is
rubbish, you must be joking,

16:53.720 --> 16:55.300
of course
Black Holes are black."

16:55.400 --> 16:57.300
"They've got such
incredible gravity,

16:57.400 --> 16:58.780
nothing can escape."

16:58.880 --> 17:00.540
"What are you talking about
Hawking radiation?"

17:00.640 --> 17:03.940
But actually now with
the benefit of hindsight

17:04.040 --> 17:07.980
uh, there's general agreement
that it's right.

17:08.080 --> 17:12.380
It's almost too beautiful
and simple not to be true

17:12.480 --> 17:15.940
and it really stands out
as one of the big moments

17:16.040 --> 17:19.240
in recent theoretical physics.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.580
Stephen's career took off
which led to his election

17:32.680 --> 17:36.360
to The Royal Society
at the age of 32.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.260
<i>At a party</i>
<i>I had arranged for him,</i>

17:40.360 --> 17:42.580
<i>afterwards he thanked</i>
<i>his supervisors</i>

17:42.680 --> 17:44.820
<i>he thanked his colleagues,</i>

17:44.920 --> 17:47.240
<i>but not a mention</i>
<i>of the family.</i>

17:48.200 --> 17:49.620
And no mention of us at all,

17:49.720 --> 17:51.840
and I found that rather hurtful.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.140
<i>He wanted to go</i>
<i>to every conference,</i>

17:56.240 --> 17:57.980
<i>every summer school,</i>

17:58.080 --> 17:59.380
<i>anywhere in the world.</i>

17:59.480 --> 18:02.440
<i>And he expected me</i>
<i>to go with him too.</i>

18:03.440 --> 18:06.780
<i>Travels were extraordinary...</i>

18:06.880 --> 18:09.420
and demanding.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.020
And we travelled and we
travelled and we travelled.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.960
<i>Jane: We spent a whole year</i>
<i>in California.</i>

18:24.680 --> 18:27.780
<i>Stephen was a visiting</i>
<i>Fairchild fellow</i>

18:27.880 --> 18:32.280
<i>at California Institute</i>
<i>of Technology.</i>

18:33.920 --> 18:34.940
And that was the most

18:35.040 --> 18:37.640
glorious year imaginable.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.520
<i>We went to the desert,</i>

18:43.400 --> 18:45.400
<i>we went to the ocean,</i>

18:46.320 --> 18:48.360
<i>we went to the mountains.</i>

18:49.880 --> 18:52.420
<i>Robert: I was 7,</i>
<i>when we went to California.</i>

18:52.520 --> 18:54.220
I found it a, um

18:54.320 --> 18:56.220
an exciting...

18:56.320 --> 18:59.020
uh, time.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.940
<i>I can still remember</i>
<i>a bit of the...</i>

19:02.040 --> 19:05.140
<i>Los Angeles freeway map</i>
<i>because...</i>

19:05.240 --> 19:07.540
I ended up being the, um

19:07.640 --> 19:09.640
family navigator.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.980
<i>At that point he made</i>
<i>the transition</i>

19:13.080 --> 19:15.640
<i>to an electric wheelchair.</i>

19:17.040 --> 19:19.180
<i>Stephen: It gave me</i>
<i>a considerable degree</i>

19:19.280 --> 19:20.500
<i>of independence</i>

19:20.600 --> 19:23.220
<i>especially as</i>
<i>in the United States</i>

19:23.320 --> 19:26.380
<i>buildings and sidewalks</i>
<i>are much more accessible</i>

19:26.480 --> 19:30.280
<i>for the disabled</i>
<i>than they are in Britain.</i>

19:32.080 --> 19:34.380
<i>Robert: We stayed in some</i>
<i>University accommodation</i>

19:34.480 --> 19:36.980
<i>which they had done</i>
<i>some adapting of it</i>

19:37.080 --> 19:38.940
<i>so that there were ramps</i>

19:39.040 --> 19:43.340
<i>so that he didn't need</i>
<i>to deal with any stairs.</i>

19:43.440 --> 19:45.660
<i>Jane: We had the most</i>
<i>beautiful house.</i>

19:45.760 --> 19:48.960
It was an enchanting year...

19:49.800 --> 19:51.800
for all of us.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.820
<i>Stephen: The excitement of</i>
<i>our new life in California</i>

19:59.920 --> 20:04.980
<i>was harshly interrupted</i>
<i>by my motor neurone disease.</i>

20:05.080 --> 20:06.620
<i>The physical symptoms took</i>

20:06.720 --> 20:09.960
<i>an irreversible turn</i>
<i>for the worse.</i>

20:11.840 --> 20:15.180
Motor neurone disease is a
condition of moving goal posts,

20:15.280 --> 20:19.460
so everyday the problems change.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.020
<i>Ammar: As Professor Hawking's</i>
<i>nerves die off</i>

20:22.120 --> 20:25.480
<i>there are some dramatic</i>
<i>drops in ability.</i>

20:26.960 --> 20:32.420
When he could no longer
use a pen and paper,

20:32.520 --> 20:34.500
he couldn't write,

20:34.600 --> 20:37.380
<i>we had no concept</i>

20:37.480 --> 20:41.640
<i>of how life changing</i>
<i>it was going to be.</i>

20:52.040 --> 20:53.580
<i>Judy: I had</i>
<i>absolutely no idea</i>

20:53.680 --> 20:56.660
<i>who he was</i>
<i>when I first met him.</i>

20:56.760 --> 20:59.620
<i>I think the advert</i>
<i>said something like</i>

20:59.720 --> 21:02.340
"Disabled scientist
needs secretary,"

21:02.440 --> 21:05.640
something as simple as that.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.260
As I walked into his office,

21:10.360 --> 21:12.260
he sat there in his wheelchair

21:12.360 --> 21:16.380
with the most wonderful twinkle
in his eye and a lovely smile

21:16.480 --> 21:18.180
and I knew at that moment

21:18.280 --> 21:20.720
that we would get along
just fine.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.780
<i>When he wanted</i>
<i>to read a book,</i>

21:23.880 --> 21:26.380
<i> I would have to turn the pages.</i>

21:26.480 --> 21:29.020
<i>And then when he wanted</i>
<i>to study something,</i>

21:29.120 --> 21:33.540
<i>he would ask me to draw it</i>
<i>on the black board for him.</i>

21:33.640 --> 21:36.980
He seemed to just
take it in his stride.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.380
That seems a funny word to use

21:39.480 --> 21:43.040
but I don't recall
Stephen ever complaining.

21:44.680 --> 21:48.460
My father had independency,
had autonomy, he had speed,

21:48.560 --> 21:50.380
which he really enjoyed.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.180
<i>So many people</i>
<i>have told me,</i>

21:52.280 --> 21:55.420
<i>that they nearly got run over</i>
<i>by him in Cambridge.</i>

21:55.520 --> 21:58.300
<i>He did things</i>
<i>that people didn't expect him</i>

21:58.400 --> 22:00.440
<i>as a disabled person to do.</i>

22:01.920 --> 22:04.580
It was quite obvious
that he-- he...

22:04.680 --> 22:07.640
There was something special
about him, there's no question.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.740
<i>Sir Roger: He was doing</i>
<i>great work</i>

22:14.840 --> 22:18.520
<i>scientifically and he</i>
<i>just would not give up.</i>

22:20.280 --> 22:22.220
He did all this...

22:22.320 --> 22:25.840
with this extraordinary
physical disability

22:26.760 --> 22:28.380
<i>and hardly able to talk.</i>

22:31.000 --> 22:32.700
You'd like to reply to that one?

22:32.800 --> 22:34.100
Yeah.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.420
<i>Judy: Because of his</i>
<i>voice diminishing,</i>

22:37.520 --> 22:41.500
you had to study his lips
and listen very carefully

22:41.600 --> 22:43.780
to what he was saying

22:43.880 --> 22:47.420
<i> so that you've got it all down</i>
<i>hopefully in one hit.</i>

22:53.040 --> 22:54.940
So it's really
a sort of cylinder?

23:00.800 --> 23:02.780
And the-- the answer
is that its universe

23:02.880 --> 23:07.260
is topologically S3 cross R1.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.380
It was intriguing

23:08.480 --> 23:10.580
that he'd got this amazing brain

23:10.680 --> 23:12.580
that could put these, um,

23:12.680 --> 23:14.580
calculations together

23:14.680 --> 23:15.820
<i>that had great meaning.</i>

23:17.480 --> 23:21.040
No, it just so happens,
that we have the universe here.

24:03.120 --> 24:06.500
<i>Judy: Stephen wanted to have</i>
<i>a conference called,</i>

24:06.600 --> 24:09.420
I think it was,
"Super Space and Super Gravity"

24:09.520 --> 24:12.580
or "Super Gravity
and Super Space."

24:12.680 --> 24:15.580
And these eminent scientists

24:15.680 --> 24:19.100
were going to be coming
from all around the world.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.980
<i>Jim: There were a group</i>
<i>of us very young physicists</i>

24:22.080 --> 24:24.580
<i>who were working on a new...</i>

24:24.680 --> 24:29.180
evolution of Einstein's theory
called "Super Gravity."

24:29.280 --> 24:32.900
And it was amazing to me
personally that this person

24:33.000 --> 24:35.580
that I had already looked
up to as a physics hero

24:35.680 --> 24:37.580
was coming to people
like me saying,

24:37.680 --> 24:40.440
"I wanna learn
what you guys are doing."

24:41.960 --> 24:44.300
<i>Judy: During the course</i>
<i>of the conference</i>

24:44.400 --> 24:46.140
<i>the whole of the black board</i>

24:46.240 --> 24:48.940
was completely covered in this

24:49.040 --> 24:53.640
wonderful arrangement
of maths and doodles.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.860
Someone decided to draw me
as, um,

24:57.960 --> 25:01.100
as a man with what looks
like a fish bowl on his head.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.420
<i>It was actually my Afro.</i>

25:04.520 --> 25:07.140
<i>Judy: I thought it was just</i>
<i>too lovely</i>

25:07.240 --> 25:08.980
to be rubbed off.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.140
So I went down to the basement

25:11.240 --> 25:13.540
and asked one of the engineers

25:13.640 --> 25:14.980
if he could possibly

25:15.080 --> 25:17.180
<i>take down the black board</i>

25:17.280 --> 25:20.540
<i>and hide it somewhere</i>
<i>till I could get back</i>

25:20.640 --> 25:23.840
<i>and work out</i>
<i>what we could do with it.</i>

25:26.880 --> 25:30.940
<i>A few years before he died,</i>
<i> he asked me to go and see him.</i>

25:31.040 --> 25:35.780
<i>I'd never been to see</i>
<i> the new office that he was in.</i>

25:35.880 --> 25:37.300
<i>And then...</i>

25:37.400 --> 25:40.180
to my enormous surprise

25:40.280 --> 25:43.900
there it was up
in Stephen's new office

25:44.000 --> 25:46.900
<i>for everyone to see.</i>

25:47.000 --> 25:49.880
<i>And I thought</i>
<i>that was so lovely.</i>

25:56.400 --> 25:58.420
<i>Roger: All the way</i>
<i>through his life</i>

25:58.520 --> 26:01.060
Stephen had faith
that the universe

26:01.160 --> 26:03.940
can be described by mathematics.

26:04.040 --> 26:09.220
<i>He was really convinced</i>
<i>that just out there...</i>

26:09.320 --> 26:12.840
<i>tantalisingly almost</i>
<i>within reach...</i>

26:15.480 --> 26:18.000
<i>there was a theory</i>
<i>of everything.</i>

26:21.240 --> 26:24.860
<i>The two big pillars of</i>
<i>20th century science</i>

26:24.960 --> 26:27.440
were general relativity...

26:28.920 --> 26:33.240
<i>which is to do</i>
<i> with the world of the very big</i>

26:34.400 --> 26:37.740
and Quantum mechanics,

26:37.840 --> 26:40.840
<i>which is the world</i>
<i>of very small.</i>

26:43.800 --> 26:47.620
These were really powerful
theories, but they gave you

26:47.720 --> 26:50.440
<i>very different pictures</i>
<i>of the universe.</i>

26:51.680 --> 26:54.380
<i>Jim: So, Stephen's quest</i>

26:54.480 --> 26:56.920
<i>was to bring these</i>
<i>things together.</i>

26:59.880 --> 27:03.100
That to me is another sign
of Stephen's bravery.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.900
<i>Because here's this guy</i>
<i>who's taking</i>

27:05.000 --> 27:07.580
<i>these two different ideas</i>
<i>that were at their borders</i>

27:07.680 --> 27:10.020
<i>totally divorced from each</i>
<i>other, and he's saying,</i>

27:10.120 --> 27:12.380
<i>"No, nature demands</i>

27:12.480 --> 27:14.680
<i>that we wield them together."</i>

27:24.320 --> 27:28.180
<i>Sometimes we theoretical</i>
<i>physicists do math...</i>

27:28.280 --> 27:30.620
<i>in our intuition,</i>
<i>in our dreams.</i>

27:30.720 --> 27:34.580
And so I believe that
the stories of mathematics

27:34.680 --> 27:37.540
resided in his mind
and imagination

27:37.640 --> 27:41.540
and he could manipulate those
without writing it on paper.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.300
To me that's a level of
creativity that is beyond

27:44.400 --> 27:47.520
what most of us have to do.

27:56.560 --> 28:00.220
<i>Jane: Stephen became</i>
<i>Lucasian Professor</i>

28:00.320 --> 28:03.440
<i>which was the chair</i>
<i>held by Newton.</i>

28:04.440 --> 28:07.580
<i>The impression that we gave</i>

28:07.680 --> 28:11.060
<i>was one of a very</i>
<i>successful family.</i>

28:11.160 --> 28:15.340
<i>Stephen was recognised</i>
<i>as a rising star</i>

28:15.440 --> 28:17.900
<i>in the world of Astrophysics.</i>

28:18.000 --> 28:22.840
So what could be
lacking in our lives?

28:25.840 --> 28:29.180
But people didn't scratch
beneath the surface

28:29.280 --> 28:34.180
<i>and a lot of people</i>
<i>didn't show much imagination.</i>

28:34.280 --> 28:36.780
<i>Sometimes I was so depressed,</i>

28:36.880 --> 28:40.040
I just felt like throwing
myself in the river.

28:43.680 --> 28:48.860
<i>Either Stephen's condition</i>
<i>would worsen dramatically</i>

28:48.960 --> 28:52.500
<i>and I didn't know</i>
<i> how we were going to manage...</i>

28:52.600 --> 28:56.220
or I wouldn't be able to cope

28:56.320 --> 28:59.640
and then what would happen
to my children?

29:02.080 --> 29:03.980
<i>Lucy: Looking back...</i>

29:04.080 --> 29:06.860
our family life

29:06.960 --> 29:09.940
was really, really hard.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.180
<i>And my father was</i>
<i>extremely vulnerable.</i>

29:12.280 --> 29:14.260
<i>You've got to imagine,</i>
<i>what would it be like</i>

29:14.360 --> 29:17.240
<i>if you couldn't even</i>
<i>turn your head.</i>

29:19.880 --> 29:22.660
Occ-- Occasionally I even helped
him with feeding.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.980
<i>My father had issues</i>
<i>with choking.</i>

29:25.080 --> 29:28.380
<i>He would convulse</i>
<i>and we needed to...</i>

29:28.480 --> 29:32.660
<i>pat him on the back</i>
<i>to address the issue.</i>

29:32.760 --> 29:33.980
We would be sitting
having dinner

29:34.080 --> 29:35.380
and then suddenly he would

29:35.480 --> 29:36.980
go into a massive choking fit

29:37.080 --> 29:39.780
and that would be
actually quite terrifying.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.500
<i>Doctors had been</i>
<i>saying to my mother,</i>

29:41.600 --> 29:43.980
<i>"Why are you cutting out food</i>
<i>and feeding it to him?</i>

29:44.080 --> 29:45.420
<i>He should be on pureed food."</i>

29:45.520 --> 29:47.420
<i>And he just refused.</i>

29:47.520 --> 29:50.740
<i>He would be like,</i>
<i>"Nope! Not having it!"</i>

29:50.840 --> 29:54.980
<i> He just insisted on having food</i>
<i>cut up and fed to him.</i>

29:55.080 --> 29:56.660
And this is my father's
stubbornness, that he just

29:56.760 --> 29:58.500
wouldn't do the obvious thing

29:58.600 --> 30:00.500
that would've made
things a lot better

30:00.600 --> 30:03.060
for everybody else
and he just wouldn't do it.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.980
He thought that...

30:05.080 --> 30:07.580
his needs needed to be met

30:07.680 --> 30:11.420
when he thought they needed
to be met and sometimes

30:11.520 --> 30:14.520
<i> that was a source of friction.</i>

30:16.080 --> 30:18.800
<i>Lucy: My mother very much</i>
<i>needed some support.</i>

30:20.600 --> 30:23.940
She had a huge burden.

30:26.880 --> 30:31.960
<i> Jane: It was as if I as a person</i>
<i>didn't exist any longer.</i>

30:35.240 --> 30:38.540
<i>In the beginning, I had been</i>
<i>led to understand</i>

30:38.640 --> 30:42.500
<i>that he had a prognosis of</i>
<i>two years,</i>

30:42.600 --> 30:47.900
but as he lived on
and, uh, the situation deteriorated,

30:48.000 --> 30:51.580
I felt there were things I
needed to be able to talk about,

30:51.680 --> 30:55.540
but he steadfastly refused
to discuss

30:55.640 --> 30:58.420
<i>his illness and the future.</i>

31:01.360 --> 31:03.700
<i>Ammar: The dynamics in</i>
<i>the family inevitably change</i>

31:03.800 --> 31:07.300
<i>when somebody has</i>
<i>a life-limiting condition.</i>

31:07.400 --> 31:09.940
One of the things that happens
in that situation is called

31:10.040 --> 31:11.260
the conspiracy of silence,

31:11.360 --> 31:12.820
and that happens
for both parties.

31:12.920 --> 31:16.360
So the person who's got the
diagnosis and the family member.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.780
<i>What it means is everyone's</i>
<i>hiding their feelings</i>

31:20.880 --> 31:22.660
<i>and everyone's pretending</i>
<i>that everything's normal</i>

31:22.760 --> 31:23.940
<i>when it isn't.</i>

31:24.040 --> 31:28.980
<i> So, inevitably it's a huge task</i>
<i>for the carer,</i>

31:29.080 --> 31:30.780
<i>and it's actually not really</i>
<i>possible</i>

31:30.880 --> 31:32.880
<i>for one person to do it</i>
<i>on their own.</i>

31:34.800 --> 31:39.780
<i> Jane: I likened our situation</i>
<i>to living on a precipice.</i>

31:39.880 --> 31:42.780
We turned our backs
on the precipice,

31:42.880 --> 31:45.360
but the precipice
was always there.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.220
<i>Jonathan: It was clear to me</i>
<i>that Jane was...</i>

31:51.320 --> 31:53.180
in a difficult place

31:53.280 --> 31:55.720
and she really needed rescuing.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.500
A good friend of mine
wanted to help me out,

32:01.600 --> 32:03.100
and so she suggested

32:03.200 --> 32:06.180
going to the local church
to sing in the choir,

32:06.280 --> 32:09.220
and I went there, and Jonathan
was the choir master.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.340
<i>Jonathan: I used to go on</i>
<i>Saturday morning</i>

32:14.440 --> 32:15.980
<i>to teach Lucy the piano,</i>

32:16.080 --> 32:20.180
and then that was when I first
started playing the piano

32:20.280 --> 32:21.780
for Jane to sing.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.980
And so Stephen would be
delighted

32:24.080 --> 32:26.640
<i>just to sit there</i>
<i>and hear Jane sing.</i>

32:28.880 --> 32:32.180
The weekly Saturday visits
built up

32:32.280 --> 32:36.100
to being more often than
once a week.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.580
<i>Jane: Jonathan was</i>
<i>a heaven sent gift,</i>

32:39.680 --> 32:42.460
taking Stephen to the bathroom,
feeding Stephen,

32:42.560 --> 32:47.300
lifting Stephen,
doing 101 things for Stephen.

32:47.400 --> 32:52.740
Without his support, I would
have gone under completely.

32:52.840 --> 32:57.460
<i>Jane: We became companions</i>
<i>in adversity.</i>

32:57.560 --> 33:01.740
<i>Jonathan: My wife had</i>
<i>died in '74,</i>

33:01.840 --> 33:06.060
and so this helped
to fill in a gap in my life.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.580
They helped to prop me up
at a time when...

33:09.680 --> 33:11.680
I felt I needed a bit of
propping.

33:13.840 --> 33:19.500
<i>Jane: Stephen understood that</i>
<i> Jonathan was there to help me.</i>

33:19.600 --> 33:21.640
<i>He seemed to accept it.</i>

33:25.200 --> 33:28.740
<i>Stephen: She gave him a room</i>
<i>in our apartment.</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:32.420
<i>I would have objected,</i>
<i>but I too, was expecting</i>

33:32.520 --> 33:34.180
<i>an early death and felt</i>

33:34.280 --> 33:38.000
<i>I needed someone to support</i>
<i> the children after I was gone.</i>

33:42.680 --> 33:46.660
I was always resisting

33:46.760 --> 33:49.000
the idea of falling in love.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.120
And I think gradually...

33:55.280 --> 33:59.800
I resisted a little less than
I had done to start with.

34:03.360 --> 34:06.000
It was not-- not easy.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.980
We knew we had feelings
for each other,

34:11.080 --> 34:13.660
but we wanted to be loyal
to Stephen,

34:13.760 --> 34:17.240
so we had to suppress our
feelings for a very long time.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.100
<i>Tim: I suppose, looking back,</i>

34:21.200 --> 34:25.100
<i>I was perhaps born into</i>
<i> a rather unconventional setup,</i>

34:25.200 --> 34:30.020
having my father and then having
Jonathan also around,

34:30.120 --> 34:33.940
and I suppose able to sort of
provide perhaps a little bit

34:34.040 --> 34:37.660
more... physical interaction
in terms of maybe

34:37.760 --> 34:41.380
you know playing cricket
in the garden or playing tag.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.520
You know, that was,
that was great actually.

34:48.360 --> 34:53.220
<i> Jane: Stephen's mother asked me</i>
<i>a very impertinent question.</i>

34:53.320 --> 34:57.820
She wanted to know
who Tim's father was.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.140
Was it Stephen or was it
Jonathan.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.020
And I told her that there was
absolutely no way

35:04.120 --> 35:09.480
that anybody other than Stephen
could be Tim's father.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.380
<i>And I was very hurt.</i>

35:13.480 --> 35:15.380
And so I told her.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.980
And then her reaction was,
"Well, of course, Jane,

35:19.080 --> 35:20.380
we've never liked you."

35:20.480 --> 35:22.760
"You don't fit into our family."

35:26.640 --> 35:28.100
<i>Lucy: From the perspective</i>
<i>of a child,</i>

35:28.200 --> 35:31.740
<i>you're in this incredibly</i>
<i>confusing situation,</i>

35:31.840 --> 35:34.540
trying to process, I suppose,
why our lives

35:34.640 --> 35:38.320
was so dramatically different
to the lives of our friends.

35:40.160 --> 35:43.140
I was aware that my mother
and Jonathan were having

35:43.240 --> 35:45.620
some form of relationship, um...

35:45.720 --> 35:47.580
I was so young
that I didn't know

35:47.680 --> 35:51.340
what an actual relationship
kind of was.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.780
<i>And I was just, you know,</i>
<i>I just hadn't questioned it.</i>

35:53.880 --> 35:55.920
<i>I just thought, "Well,</i>
<i>this is-- this is normal."</i>

35:58.000 --> 36:02.380
I tried to be
a substitute for Stephen

36:02.480 --> 36:03.980
with things
that he wasn't able to do.

36:04.080 --> 36:08.100
But I did make a point of not
trying to do the things

36:08.200 --> 36:09.780
that Stephen did do with them.

36:11.480 --> 36:12.740
<i>It was a question, just of</i>

36:12.840 --> 36:14.840
<i>not stepping on his toes.</i>

36:18.120 --> 36:22.380
<i> Tim: My dad and I, we were able</i>
<i>to have a relationship.</i>

36:22.480 --> 36:24.300
It was just based on
simple things, like

36:24.400 --> 36:26.560
going down
to the ice cream van together.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.180
<i>This ecosystem</i>
<i>that we were living in</i>

36:33.280 --> 36:34.700
<i>seemed to sort of function.</i>

36:34.800 --> 36:38.980
<i>I didn't think of it</i>
<i>as abnormal in any way.</i>

36:39.080 --> 36:41.820
<i>That's not to say that there</i>
<i>probably wasn't a lot going</i>

36:41.920 --> 36:44.300
<i>on under the water.</i>

36:44.400 --> 36:46.620
<i>Sort of like</i>
<i>a paddling duck, but</i>

36:46.720 --> 36:50.640
for me as a kid, it seemed to
work fairly well at the time.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.620
Jonathan and I took
the car and the children

37:00.720 --> 37:04.740
and we camped in a little place
called Rothenburg.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.740
<i>Jonathan: That was a holiday</i>
<i>for the children.</i>

37:06.840 --> 37:10.580
It was time when the children
were having a bit of time...

37:10.680 --> 37:12.580
in mucking about in tents

37:12.680 --> 37:15.640
which, um, I think they enjoyed.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.580
<i>Jane: Stephen was in Geneva.</i>

37:19.680 --> 37:23.500
<i>We were all going</i>
<i>to meet up in Bayreuth</i>

37:23.600 --> 37:27.180
for a performance
of Wagner's Ring.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.300
Stephen was passionate
about Wagner

37:29.400 --> 37:31.500
and love to listen to it
very loudly,

37:31.600 --> 37:33.620
um, much to the consternation
of anybody

37:33.720 --> 37:35.460
who was in--
within earshot.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.380
The only opera that existed
for him was Wagner...

37:39.480 --> 37:41.600
and Wagner, Wagner, Wagner.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.380
We were just sitting down
to dinner in a restaurant,

37:49.480 --> 37:51.620
and I think my mum got up
to use the pay phone

37:51.720 --> 37:53.420
just to sort of see
how everything was,

37:53.520 --> 37:56.340
and then she sort of
came back...

37:56.440 --> 37:59.700
you know, looking like
she'd just seen a ghost.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.220
<i>Tim: My father had fallen ill</i>
<i>with pneumonia.</i>

38:03.320 --> 38:05.380
Mother came back and said,
"Your father is really ill,

38:05.480 --> 38:07.580
we have to go now,"
and we sort of all bundled

38:07.680 --> 38:11.280
in the car and drove to Geneva.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.180
<i>Jonathan: Jane was</i>
<i>understandably distraught,</i>

38:16.280 --> 38:18.860
and I drove 400 miles,

38:18.960 --> 38:21.520
just wondering
what we were going to find.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.900
<i>Tim: We went straight</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

38:29.000 --> 38:31.780
My first experience of
visiting a hospital

38:31.880 --> 38:35.280
as a child is always
quite a shock.

38:42.960 --> 38:46.060
I remember him just being white,
like being salt white,

38:46.160 --> 38:49.180
lying on a white sheet
in a white room, being white.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.500
And it was really scary.

38:50.600 --> 38:53.500
I mean, he was
really, really ill.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.820
<i>Jane: Stephen lay there</i>
<i>in a comatose state.</i>

38:57.920 --> 39:01.940
<i> The doctors took me to one side</i>
<i>and said, "Look,</i>

39:02.040 --> 39:03.980
<i> if we try to bring him 'round,</i>

39:04.080 --> 39:06.420
he might not survive."

39:06.520 --> 39:08.780
"There's nothing
we can do for him."

39:08.880 --> 39:12.040
"Should we turn off
the life support machine?"

39:17.680 --> 39:19.420
<i>I flatly refused.</i>

39:31.440 --> 39:34.940
They brought him 'round
and he came 'round.

39:35.040 --> 39:40.780
And we had a Red Cross jet
to take us back to Cambridge.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.220
<i>Judy: The telephone rang</i>
<i>and it was somebody</i>

39:49.320 --> 39:50.620
from Gonville and Caius

39:50.720 --> 39:52.580
telling me that this plane

39:52.680 --> 39:57.800
was coming into Cambridge
airport with Stephen on board.

40:00.760 --> 40:04.140
<i> I walked across to the hospital</i>

40:04.240 --> 40:07.980
<i>and saw Jane in the corridor.</i>

40:08.080 --> 40:12.420
<i>Jane was tired and concerned</i>

40:12.520 --> 40:14.820
beyond belief and overwhelmed

40:14.920 --> 40:17.740
and there were moments,
I have to say,

40:17.840 --> 40:21.020
in the first couple of days
where, um,

40:21.120 --> 40:23.120
it was touch and go.

40:24.400 --> 40:28.100
Stephen was at huge risk.

40:28.200 --> 40:31.680
Stephen was certain to die.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.900
His motor neurone disease

40:38.000 --> 40:41.060
was beginning to paralyse
the muscles

40:41.160 --> 40:43.540
of his voice box, his larynx.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.100
<i>It was blocking his airway...</i>

40:46.200 --> 40:48.200
<i>so he couldn't breathe.</i>

40:49.080 --> 40:54.020
<i>So, the team at Cambridge</i>
<i>made a opening</i>

40:54.120 --> 40:57.900
in the neck directly
into his wind pipe.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.140
We call it a tracheostomy.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.780
And to keep that opening open,

41:01.880 --> 41:05.540
they put in a tube,
a tracheostomy tube.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.620
That meant that Stephen
could breathe directly

41:08.720 --> 41:10.840
through that tube
into his lungs.

41:12.800 --> 41:17.340
<i>Stephen was once again able</i>
<i>to breathe on his own.</i>

41:17.440 --> 41:20.140
He'd had a tracheostomy,

41:20.240 --> 41:21.780
and that meant

41:21.880 --> 41:26.940
that he no longer
had a voice at all.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.500
The impact of that was
devastating

41:29.600 --> 41:32.480
because Stephen had no means
of communication.

41:34.280 --> 41:38.760
<i>Judy: We were never going</i>
<i>to hear his voice ever again.</i>

41:40.600 --> 41:42.720
How was he going to communicate?

41:48.720 --> 41:50.460
<i> Lucy: Most misunderstood thing</i>
<i>about my father</i>

41:50.560 --> 41:52.540
<i>is how much he suffered.</i>

41:52.640 --> 41:54.260
<i>He found night times</i>
<i>particularly</i>

41:54.360 --> 41:56.020
frightening because he couldn't

41:56.120 --> 41:58.300
actually produce any sound.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.380
It wasn't just that
he couldn't speak.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.940
He couldn't even produce

42:02.040 --> 42:05.600
<i>a scream or a-- or a gasp</i>
<i>or anything like that.</i>

42:06.520 --> 42:08.520
<i>Terrifying.</i>

42:11.200 --> 42:13.380
<i>Ammar: In the 1980s,</i>
<i>if you're locked in</i>

42:13.480 --> 42:15.100
and you have no way of
communicating

42:15.200 --> 42:16.980
with the outside world,
except perhaps through blink,

42:17.080 --> 42:20.940
<i>you really do need</i>
<i>24-hour watching.</i>

42:21.040 --> 42:23.180
<i>How else can you tell if</i>
<i>Professor Hawking actually</i>

42:23.280 --> 42:25.560
<i>has pain or has some need?</i>

42:27.200 --> 42:30.580
He was in hospital
for four months,

42:30.680 --> 42:33.640
and then they decided it was
time to discharge him.

42:35.080 --> 42:40.600
So, I had very hastily to try
and find a care team.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.700
<i>Stephen accepted the nurses</i>

42:45.800 --> 42:48.040
<i>in the house</i>
<i>because we needed them.</i>

42:50.080 --> 42:52.080
He just enjoyed the attention.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.580
<i> Lucy: Some of them were lovely.</i>

42:55.680 --> 42:58.100
There were nurses then who have
remained lifelong friends

42:58.200 --> 42:59.380
of us as a family.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.420
But there are others
who have not.

43:02.520 --> 43:03.940
<i>I remember one nurse</i>
<i>snatching the newspaper</i>

43:04.040 --> 43:05.820
<i>out of my hand, like,</i>
<i>"This is for your father."</i>

43:05.920 --> 43:07.940
<i>And I was like, "But I always</i>
<i> read the paper in the morning."</i>

43:08.040 --> 43:11.660
<i>"And then I give it to him.</i>
<i>That's what we do."</i>

43:11.760 --> 43:15.380
It felt like they had come in
and they were saying,

43:15.480 --> 43:17.660
"We run this place now."

43:17.760 --> 43:20.380
<i>I just remember thinking,</i>

43:20.480 --> 43:22.560
<i>"I don't know</i>
<i>that I like this."</i>

43:23.880 --> 43:26.660
It does upset
the dynamics of a family home

43:26.760 --> 43:29.780
when suddenly lots of other
people are coming in.

43:29.880 --> 43:31.820
<i>I certainly felt</i>
<i>a dramatic change</i>

43:31.920 --> 43:34.960
<i>in terms of the ecosystem</i>
<i>that we'd existed in before.</i>

43:37.720 --> 43:40.620
<i> Jane: This new batch of people</i>
<i>came into the house</i>

43:40.720 --> 43:44.140
<i> and they worshipped the ground</i>
<i>under the wheels</i>

43:44.240 --> 43:46.380
<i>of his wheelchair.</i>

43:46.480 --> 43:49.900
<i> And that was impossible for us</i>
<i>to compete with</i>

43:50.000 --> 43:52.280
<i>because that wasn't</i>
<i>how we lived.</i>

43:54.600 --> 43:56.780
We felt pushed into a corner,

43:56.880 --> 43:58.980
which made us feel very
uncomfortable

43:59.080 --> 44:01.080
in our own home.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.580
<i>Mary: When Stephen lost</i>
<i>his voice,</i>

44:06.680 --> 44:09.860
<i>it was extremely worrying</i>
<i>and depressing.</i>

44:09.960 --> 44:15.580
<i>His carers and nurses were</i>
<i>using a letter board.</i>

44:15.680 --> 44:18.680
<i>You have the letters of</i>
<i>the alphabet,</i>

44:19.480 --> 44:21.580
you point to the letter,

44:21.680 --> 44:25.300
and the individual who is trying
to communicate with you

44:25.400 --> 44:28.340
indicates yes or no,

44:28.440 --> 44:30.100
and you build up
a word like that,

44:30.200 --> 44:32.200
guessing a lot of the time.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.820
<i>And if you think</i>
<i>that is the only way</i>

44:36.920 --> 44:39.700
<i>you're going to be able</i>
<i>to communicate...</i>

44:39.800 --> 44:41.540
<i>it's extremely depressing.</i>

44:46.680 --> 44:48.580
<i>Lucy: It was enormously</i>
<i>traumatic</i>

44:48.680 --> 44:52.340
<i>trying to interpret</i>
<i>what he wanted.</i>

44:52.440 --> 44:54.820
I can remember him
just looking arghh...

44:54.920 --> 44:56.980
you know, really frustrated.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.880
Like, "Oh, my God. What are
we going to do now?"

45:07.880 --> 45:13.180
<i>Judy: I had seen on</i>
<i>a program on TV,</i>

45:13.280 --> 45:16.220
<i> a device which was going to try</i>

45:16.320 --> 45:19.420
and enable people who had

45:19.520 --> 45:23.580
no means of communicating
with anybody

45:23.680 --> 45:27.140
<i>being able to do so.</i>

45:27.240 --> 45:31.260
So, first, I've got to line
my eye up with the computer.

45:31.360 --> 45:32.900
So, I just stare
at the centre of the screen,

45:33.000 --> 45:37.540
and there you can see
the computer locking on.

45:37.640 --> 45:41.540
<i>Judy: The students</i>
<i>from the department</i>

45:41.640 --> 45:45.580
looked into the possibilities
of changing it

45:45.680 --> 45:49.660
<i>so that he could use</i>
<i>his finger and thumb</i>

45:49.760 --> 45:53.440
<i>to produce the characters</i>
<i>or the words on the screen.</i>

45:56.080 --> 45:58.300
I think it went...

45:58.400 --> 46:00.380
"Hello, my name is
Stephen Hawking."

46:00.480 --> 46:03.020
And everyone was like,
"Woah, dad, you're American."

46:03.120 --> 46:05.120
"That's amazing."

46:05.640 --> 46:08.980
Hello,
my name is Stephen Hawking.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.940
Can you hear me?

46:11.040 --> 46:16.060
For the first time in years,
he was free.

46:16.160 --> 46:20.260
Just as the electric wheelchair
gave him freedom of movement,

46:20.360 --> 46:25.440
so the voice gave him
freedom of speech again.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.820
-I will buy nine houses.
- Sure, dad.

46:32.920 --> 46:36.340
<i>Stephen: My youngest son,</i>
<i>who was only 6 at the time</i>

46:36.440 --> 46:38.180
<i>of my tracheostomy</i>

46:38.280 --> 46:40.940
<i> never could make me out before.</i>

46:41.040 --> 46:43.660
<i>Now he has no difficulty.</i>

46:43.760 --> 46:47.100
<i> That means a great deal to me.</i>

46:47.200 --> 46:49.340
-I was on New York.
- Okay.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.100
Then I got an eight right?

46:51.200 --> 46:55.300
That was very much
the dawning of a, a sort of,

46:55.400 --> 46:58.100
you know, golden era of
communication with him.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.540
It just meant that we could
actually begin a,

47:00.640 --> 47:03.380
a sort of father-son
relationship.

47:03.480 --> 47:05.060
King's knight pawn.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.580
This one? Two?

47:07.680 --> 47:10.540
<i>Tim: Of course, you might say</i>
<i>something to him,</i>

47:10.640 --> 47:14.220
and then you'd have to wait sort
of five minutes for him

47:14.320 --> 47:16.980
to come back with a--
with a response,

47:17.080 --> 47:19.420
which then was a bit awkward
because you didn't know

47:19.520 --> 47:23.100
how to be in that-- in that--
in that interim period.

47:23.200 --> 47:24.660
<i>My father's attitude towards</i>

47:24.760 --> 47:28.140
<i> games was to win at all costs.</i>

47:28.240 --> 47:30.820
<i>He was a ruthless competitor.</i>

47:30.920 --> 47:34.940
I, however, was, uh,
was equally determined

47:35.040 --> 47:38.540
to try and win, particularly
at things like chess.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.660
As-- as time wore on, obviously,
it became very clear

47:40.760 --> 47:43.380
that I wasn't likely to win
at chess,

47:43.480 --> 47:46.540
um, or-- or scrabble, um...

47:46.640 --> 47:50.020
And it was on the occasion of
his 70th birthday

47:50.120 --> 47:52.860
when I had to finally
admit to him that I had...

47:52.960 --> 47:56.020
I might have cheated
a few times.

48:12.240 --> 48:14.060
Once he found a way
to communicate

48:14.160 --> 48:15.500
with the help of technology,

48:15.600 --> 48:17.420
he was off and running
and I knew

48:17.520 --> 48:20.460
<i>the book was a big priority</i>
<i>for him.</i>

48:22.360 --> 48:26.500
<i>Stephen: I had the idea of</i>
<i>writing a popular book.</i>

48:26.600 --> 48:29.620
<i>I wanted to explain</i>
<i>how we might be near finding</i>

48:29.720 --> 48:33.380
<i>a complete theory that would</i>
<i>describe the universe</i>

48:33.480 --> 48:34.940
<i>and everything in it.</i>

48:38.680 --> 48:42.300
<i> I thought I might make a modest</i>
<i>amount to help support</i>

48:42.400 --> 48:46.840
<i>my children at school and</i>
<i>the rising costs of my care.</i>

48:48.320 --> 48:52.540
I expect he thought
he was onto something...

48:52.640 --> 48:54.980
because he said he wanted it
to be sold in airports.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.700
That was his famous line,
you know,

48:56.800 --> 48:59.280
"I want this book
to be sold in airports."

49:01.280 --> 49:05.100
<i> Peter: To be absolutely honest,</i>
<i>the early draft,</i>

49:05.200 --> 49:06.620
<i>it was pretty dull.</i>

49:06.720 --> 49:09.900
So, I would write
in my margin notes,

49:10.000 --> 49:11.780
"I'm losing the gist here."

49:11.880 --> 49:13.980
<i>"Could you give</i>
<i>a little anecdote?"</i>

49:14.080 --> 49:18.100
<i>"Could you somehow</i>
<i>get me interested?"</i>

49:18.200 --> 49:22.800
<i>Stephen: At times, I thought</i>
<i>the process would never end.</i>

49:24.080 --> 49:26.700
<i>Peter: To his credit,</i>
<i>a lesser man</i>

49:26.800 --> 49:30.940
<i>might have gotten frustrated,</i>
<i>tired, given up,</i>

49:31.040 --> 49:34.380
but it was very clear what
a strong-minded person he was

49:34.480 --> 49:37.380
and that he could dig in,
no question about it.

49:37.480 --> 49:39.140
<i>We had one mission,</i>
<i>which is to make</i>

49:39.240 --> 49:41.240
<i>this book very successful.</i>

49:42.680 --> 49:45.580
For seven weeks a book
about scientific theory

49:45.680 --> 49:47.020
has been a top best seller.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.700
<i>It's called</i>
<i>"A Brief History of Time"</i>

49:48.800 --> 49:50.460
<i>and it was written</i>
<i>by a remarkable scientist</i>

49:50.560 --> 49:52.900
<i>named Stephen Hawking.</i>

49:53.000 --> 49:56.780
You look to the skies and hope
that lightning will strike

49:56.880 --> 50:01.780
and every once in a rare,
rare while, um

50:01.880 --> 50:05.540
lightning does strike,
and it struck here.

50:05.640 --> 50:07.460
<i>Man on TV: Professor</i>
<i>Stephen William Hawking</i>

50:07.560 --> 50:09.140
<i>is an intellectual icon.</i>

50:09.240 --> 50:11.620
Professor Stephen Hawking has
been acknowledged as one of

50:11.720 --> 50:14.180
the most brilliant scientists
in the world and also

50:14.280 --> 50:15.860
<i> as one of its most courageous.</i>

50:15.960 --> 50:19.460
The man often compared to
Galileo, Einstein and Newton.

50:19.560 --> 50:21.380
You've been dubbed
the new Einstein.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.060
How do you react to that?

50:23.160 --> 50:25.060
That is media hype.

50:27.400 --> 50:31.940
<i> Peter: In those days, a million</i>
<i>copies was a huge bestseller.</i>

50:32.040 --> 50:37.360
This book sold 10 million copies
worldwide.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.600
<i> So, the success was phenomenal.</i>

50:46.680 --> 50:48.860
Were you surprised
by its success?

50:48.960 --> 50:51.180
I'm told that soon
it will have been

50:51.280 --> 50:52.980
in the the bestseller list

50:53.080 --> 50:57.060
for longer than any other book
in history.

50:57.160 --> 51:00.380
There's an old joke,
which is there's two kinds of

51:00.480 --> 51:02.540
popular science book.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.460
There's
"A Brief History of Time,"

51:04.560 --> 51:06.560
and there's all the rest.

51:08.320 --> 51:10.260
My first encounter
with Stephen Hawking

51:10.360 --> 51:12.860
wasn't really planned at all.

51:12.960 --> 51:15.180
<i>I found myself in</i>
<i>the University of California,</i>

51:15.280 --> 51:18.420
<i>Berkeley and I can remember</i>
<i>the press officer said,</i>

51:18.520 --> 51:19.980
"There's going to be
a press conference."

51:20.080 --> 51:24.180
"Um, it's a British physicist,
Stephen Hawking."

51:24.280 --> 51:27.560
"He's going to launch his book,
A Brief History of Time."

51:29.160 --> 51:33.260
<i>I was kind of blown away</i>
<i>by the ballyhoo of it all.</i>

51:33.360 --> 51:37.460
<i>The main auditorium</i>
<i>was completely overloaded.</i>

51:37.560 --> 51:39.420
<i>I've never seen a physicist</i>

51:39.520 --> 51:43.760
<i>with a kind of rock star</i>
<i>reception like this.</i>

51:45.520 --> 51:47.980
<i>There was something</i>
<i>extraordinary</i>

51:48.080 --> 51:51.500
about the idea of a mind

51:51.600 --> 51:55.060
trapped in a near useless body
that was actually ranging

51:55.160 --> 51:57.020
across the whole universe.

51:58.720 --> 52:02.780
<i>But I think also it struck</i>
<i>some collective nerve.</i>

52:02.880 --> 52:07.180
<i>People felt that they were</i>
<i>going to get tangible answers</i>

52:07.280 --> 52:12.140
to some of the biggest questions
that had exercised theologians

52:12.240 --> 52:17.580
and religious figures
and philosophers over millennia.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.100
<i>Stephen Hawking himself</i>
<i>talked about</i>

52:20.200 --> 52:22.600
<i>knowing the mind of God.</i>

52:23.800 --> 52:26.140
And if you bought this book,
you, too,

52:26.240 --> 52:28.580
could share in these secrets.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.740
Did I read it? Um, No.

52:30.840 --> 52:32.660
I mean, I wouldn't have a clue
what was in it.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.760
I just didn't understand it.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.780
<i>Tim: I got a sense that</i>
<i> the book was doing really well</i>

52:42.880 --> 52:47.620
when my father took me out
to buy me

52:47.720 --> 52:49.380
<i>what was at the time,</i>

52:49.480 --> 52:51.740
<i>the most expensive Lego set.</i>

52:51.840 --> 52:56.260
It was about £100,
which in 1988 was actually

52:56.360 --> 52:58.580
a lot for-- for Christmas
and birthdays,

52:58.680 --> 53:02.100
let alone just
a sort of random gift.

53:02.200 --> 53:04.480
<i>I got a sense</i>
<i>that things are changing.</i>

53:06.880 --> 53:09.540
There were some sort
of great experiences

53:09.640 --> 53:10.980
<i>that opened up to me.</i>

53:11.080 --> 53:12.620
<i>For example, I got to travel</i>
<i>with my dad</i>

53:12.720 --> 53:16.460
<i>to New York on Concord,</i>
<i>when I was 9.</i>

53:16.560 --> 53:20.700
<i>I was with my father</i>
<i>when he met the Pope.</i>

53:20.800 --> 53:23.340
<i>An interesting meeting of</i>
<i>two very</i>

53:23.440 --> 53:26.600
divergent perspectives

53:28.160 --> 53:32.980
<i>Mary: The motif of</i>
<i>a crippled scientist</i>

53:33.080 --> 53:39.000
contributed a great deal
to his public image.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.900
<i>I've often wondered</i>
<i>how much of an icon Stephen</i>

53:43.000 --> 53:46.720
<i> would have been had he not had</i>
<i>motor neurone disease.</i>

53:51.480 --> 53:52.980
Fame is a strange phenomenon.

53:53.080 --> 53:54.460
I mean, I-- I don't think really

53:54.560 --> 53:56.300
we understand it, what it is,

53:56.400 --> 53:58.380
why it happens to people, um...

53:58.480 --> 54:00.820
what the consequences are
for that person and also

54:00.920 --> 54:03.100
what the consequences are
for those around them.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.060
<i>Judy: The post started</i>
<i>arriving.</i>

54:08.160 --> 54:10.580
<i> He had all these opportunities,</i>

and so whatever
he was presented with

54:14.000 --> 54:16.720
<i>if it tickled his fancy,</i>
<i>he'd go for it.</i>

54:23.880 --> 54:25.460

<i>now gave him</i>

54:25.560 --> 54:27.460

to worry about the consequences.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.620
Can you hear me?

54:39.720 --> 54:42.980
Why do we remember the past,
but not the future?

54:43.080 --> 54:47.260
In other words, why does
time go forwards?

54:47.360 --> 54:50.680
<i>Jane: He was mobbed and</i>

55:08.680 --> 55:12.540
<i>He must have been about 8.</i>

55:12.640 --> 55:14.540
They called for a child
in the audience

55:14.640 --> 55:17.380
to come up and sing a song.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.460
So, Stephen was out of his feet
and up there

55:19.560 --> 55:21.560
before anyone else.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.660
<i>And he sang</i>

55:24.760 --> 55:27.540
<i>"Ye Gentlemen of England</i>
<i> that guard our native shores."</i>

55:27.640 --> 55:31.380
<i>And it's got about 20 verses.</i>

55:31.480 --> 55:33.740
And Stephen insisted
on singing the whole lot

55:33.840 --> 55:36.520
and they couldn't shut him up.

55:39.440 --> 55:43.820
<i>Lucy: He'd always been</i>
<i>the circus ring master,</i>

55:43.920 --> 55:46.660
<i>but with</i>
<i>"Brief History Of Time,"</i>

55:46.760 --> 55:49.440
the circus got
a whole lot bigger.

55:54.280 --> 55:58.780
<i>Jane: The children and I</i>
<i>had to be on parade...</i>

55:58.880 --> 56:00.180
to support Stephen

56:00.280 --> 56:05.580
because Stephen wanted to be
recognised worldwide.

56:05.680 --> 56:09.040
<i>And that became more and more</i>
<i>uncomfortable.</i>

56:10.680 --> 56:13.420
<i>Lucy: He didn't understand</i>
<i>the impact that he had</i>

56:13.520 --> 56:16.340
on other people close to him.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.380
I don't think he understood

56:19.480 --> 56:21.380
what it was like
to be somebody else.

56:21.480 --> 56:22.980
I don't think he had that kind

56:23.080 --> 56:24.860
of empathetic interchange

56:24.960 --> 56:26.960
of what would this be
like for you?

56:29.080 --> 56:30.420
<i>Jane: I'm not a scientist.</i>

56:30.520 --> 56:32.140
I'm not an appendage

56:32.240 --> 56:34.820
of Stephen
as I very much feel I am

56:34.920 --> 56:37.860
Um, when we go to some of
these official gatherings.

56:37.960 --> 56:40.260
I mean, sometimes I'm not even
introduced to people.

56:40.360 --> 56:43.100
I come along behind, and, um,

56:43.200 --> 56:46.300
<i>I-- I don't really know</i>
<i>who I'm speaking to.</i>

56:50.880 --> 56:52.780
What gives you
the greatest pleasure?

56:52.880 --> 56:56.620
To discover something
new about the universe.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.180
<i>Lucy: My father took</i>
<i>to the whole fame thing</i>

56:58.280 --> 56:59.740
<i>like a duck to water.</i>

56:59.840 --> 57:03.580
However, people just didn't
understand how much effort

57:03.680 --> 57:07.980
he had to put into every
single public appearance.

57:08.080 --> 57:10.080
<i>He said to me,</i>
<i>"I'm actually very lonely."</i>

57:14.280 --> 57:17.940
<i>Peter: I went to a party</i>
<i>in New York honouring Stephen</i>

57:18.040 --> 57:20.500
as the man of the year, and

57:20.600 --> 57:23.060
Stephen was sitting
in his wheelchair,

57:23.160 --> 57:27.100
and people were very hesitant
to kind of bridge the gap

57:27.200 --> 57:30.540
to reach out to him
to come over and say anything.

57:30.640 --> 57:34.460
<i>And as I approached,</i>
<i>it was just so clear</i>

57:34.560 --> 57:38.060
<i>that he was both relieved</i>
<i>and thrilled to see me.</i>

57:38.160 --> 57:42.020
It was just relief, uh,
that somebody here is willing

57:42.120 --> 57:43.980
<i>to kind of connect with me.</i>

57:48.480 --> 57:50.780
<i>Judy: Fame brought with it</i>

57:50.880 --> 57:56.460
a lot of organisation
behind the scenes.

57:56.560 --> 57:59.860
A lot of other things
had to happen.

57:59.960 --> 58:02.700
<i>We started to have</i>
<i>to think about</i>

58:02.800 --> 58:04.940
<i>how were we going</i>
<i>to get him</i>

58:05.040 --> 58:09.300
<i>to whichever lecture</i>
<i>he was going to give.</i>

58:09.400 --> 58:11.560
Who would he need
to go with him?

58:13.200 --> 58:14.860
<i>I saw the beginnings of</i>

58:14.960 --> 58:18.460
a little bit of trouble
when Stephen's

58:18.560 --> 58:22.980
nurse Elaine came on the scene.

58:24.960 --> 58:28.940
<i>Elaine was trying</i>
<i>to make sure that</i>

58:29.040 --> 58:33.720
<i>she was on duty</i>
<i> when she wanted to be on duty.</i>

58:36.320 --> 58:40.620
<i>Woman 1: I'm preoccupied</i>
<i>with trying to get him...</i>

58:40.720 --> 58:43.400
<i>in as good shape as I can.</i>

58:46.800 --> 58:50.920
<i>Judy: She just seemed</i>
<i>to me to be...</i>

58:53.040 --> 58:57.020
maybe flamboyant at first,

58:57.120 --> 58:59.060
but Stephen seemed happy,

58:59.160 --> 59:01.440
<i>and that was what was</i>
<i>important.</i>

59:03.440 --> 59:06.780
<i>Mary: Elaine was very,</i>
<i>very friendly.</i>

59:06.880 --> 59:08.980
I think Stephen and Elaine
got on so well

59:09.080 --> 59:13.880
because they shared the same
sense of fun and humour.

59:18.120 --> 59:19.980
Fame, vulnerability, genius.

59:20.080 --> 59:22.080
These are all magnets.

59:22.920 --> 59:26.420
I realised that Elaine was
becoming more and more dominant.

59:26.520 --> 59:28.340
Oh, yes, that's right.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.660
Oh, right.

59:29.760 --> 59:31.620
The house seemed to sort of
reverberate

59:31.720 --> 59:33.300
to the sound of her laugh.

59:34.560 --> 59:36.680
<i> She seemed to be around a lot.</i>

59:38.720 --> 59:41.380
<i> Jane: It was obvious that there</i>
<i>was a relationship</i>

59:41.480 --> 59:44.180
<i>between Stephen and Elaine.</i>

59:44.280 --> 59:46.280
<i>They didn't hide it.</i>

59:47.320 --> 59:48.900
By comparison,

59:49.000 --> 59:51.620
my relationship with Jonathan
was very mild

59:51.720 --> 59:55.220
and dedicated to Stephen's care

59:55.320 --> 59:58.000
and keeping the family going.

59:59.600 --> 1:00:01.780
<i>Stephen: I became more</i>
<i>and more unhappy</i>

1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:04.740
<i>about the increasingly</i>
<i>close relationship</i>

1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:07.540
<i>between Jane and Jonathan.</i>

1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:11.080
<i>In the end, I could stand</i>
<i>the situation no more.</i>

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:16.580
<i>Mary: I'd rather doubt</i>
<i>whether Elaine was the cause</i>

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:19.220
<i>of the breakdown in</i>

1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:21.380
Stephen and Jane's relationship

1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:24.900
because I suspect that
that had broken down

1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.420
a considerable time before

1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:28.460
when Jonathan appeared
on the scene.

1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:31.260
<i>I felt that Stephen</i>
<i>was being neglected</i>

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:33.700
<i>in favour of Jonathan.</i>

1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:35.620
<i>Jonathan appeared</i>
<i>to be being treated</i>

1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:38.020
<i>as the man of the house</i>

1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.420
<i>and Stephen as a...</i>

1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:43.420
<i>dependent lodger.</i>

1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:45.860
<i>Tim: I had the sense</i>
<i>that the fabric of our</i>

1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:49.740
<i>immediate family</i>
<i>was breaking up somewhat.</i>

1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:52.460
<i>It was becoming a very</i>
<i>claustrophobic environment,</i>

1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:56.580
<i>but there was a lid on it,</i>
<i>just about...</i>

1:00:56.680 --> 1:00:59.040
and it felt all a bit fragile.

1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.860
<i>Jane: Stephen was complaining</i>
<i>that he didn't get time</i>

1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:13.300
<i>to do any work in Cambridge,</i>
<i>there were always people</i>

1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:14.700
<i>knocking at his door.</i>

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:18.740
<i>So, we had bought a house</i>
<i>in France.</i>

1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:22.020
<i>And, then,</i>
<i>Elaine Mason and her husband</i>

1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:24.560
<i>and sons arrived.</i>

1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:29.080
And that was the beginning
of the end.

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:32.220
I very clearly remember

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:34.900
the night when it all
sort of blew up.

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.460
It had been festering
for quite some time,

1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:38.620
a bit like when you're waiting

1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:40.900
for a thunderstorm
to-- to happen.

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:46.900
<i>It was quite late and my room</i>
<i>was right above</i>

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.940
<i>the room where it was all</i>
<i>happening so I could hear it.</i>

1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:51.100
<i>And then, of course,</i>
<i>I got out of bed,</i>

1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:53.060
<i>in my pyjamas and then...</i>

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:56.220
<i>sort of went down and I was</i>
<i>just sort of sat on the floor</i>

1:01:56.320 --> 1:01:59.780
<i>outside the room</i>
<i>where it was all happening.</i>

1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:03.060
I was berated
on all fronts.

1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:05.940
I was a wicked woman,
I didn't look after Stephen.

1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:09.280
You name it,
it was hurled at me.

1:02:11.720 --> 1:02:13.660
<i>Tim: One of the things</i>
<i>I remember my father saying</i>

1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:15.740
<i>to my mother was...</i>

1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:19.580
that she, uh,
never kissed him on the lips.

1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:21.300
Being sort of 8 or 9 years old,
I was like,

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:22.820
"Well, why is that a problem?"

1:02:22.920 --> 1:02:24.940
I think you know, as you get
older you realise that,

1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:27.340
that's I suppose something that,
you know, is important

1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:30.220
within a relationship, so...

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:33.140
The key thing that I remember my
father saying on that night was

1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:35.440
"If Elaine goes, Jonathan goes."

1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:40.620
And it was the most
horrible time imaginable.

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:43.360
I don't really want
to go back over it.

1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:53.900
We all understand
that people split up

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.620
and that people move on
and that these things happen.

1:02:57.720 --> 1:03:00.640
<i>However, Christmas day.</i>

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:05.420
He gave us all our presents
in the morning.

1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:07.220
<i>And then my dad made</i>
<i>this big thing</i>

1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.320
<i>of going off with Elaine.</i>

1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:12.780
Which I thought...

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:16.500
still think was
unnecessarily brutal.

1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:18.500
<i>We didn't have</i>
<i>the resources of adults,</i>

1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:20.020
<i>we didn't have the mentality</i>
<i>of adults,</i>

1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:22.960
<i>we didn't have the context</i>
<i>or the perspective.</i>

1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:26.120
<i>We were just kids.</i>

1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:33.140
Professor Hawking, after
25 years of marriage to Jane,

1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:34.540
what went wrong?

1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:36.220
I won't answer that.

1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:41.620
You've said yourself that Jane
gave you something to live for.

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:43.580
Why did you leave her?

1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:45.680
I won't answer that.

1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:55.620
<i>Woman on TV: Stephen Hawking</i>
<i>arrived</i>

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:56.620
<i>at the Registrar office,</i>

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:59.260
<i> well prepared for the service.</i>

<i>The brilliant scientist</i>
<i>who has to use</i>

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:04.620
<i>a voice synthesiser to speak</i>
<i>had already programmed in</i>

1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:06.860
<i>all his responses</i>
<i>for the ceremony.</i>

1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:09.980
You could not meet Elaine
and not be struck by Elaine.

1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:13.020
Very open and warm...

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:18.380
<i> Tall and striking and this kind</i>
<i>of mane of gold-red hair.</i>

1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:20.940
Stephen perked up a lot...

1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:23.860
when he took up with Elaine.

1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:25.960
<i>He seemed happier.</i>

1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:30.680
I'm marrying
the woman I love.

1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:37.420
Her positive cheerful
ebullience,

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:42.140
slightly wacky sense of humour
et cetera all...

1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:46.340
all seemed to benefit Stephen.

1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:49.180
This is the most loving man
I know.

1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:51.680
And the coolest man I know.

1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:00.380
I had seen enough of Elaine
by then

1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:03.780
to think there was no way
I could be there.

1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:06.420
<i>Robert: I went because</i>
<i>he was my father,</i>

1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:08.900

<i>be with him</i>
<i>when he'd invited me.</i>

I wasn't entirely sure about

1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:21.740

to progress,
to do things is just...

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.880
perhaps his-- his
greatest thing.

<i>Robert: My father</i>

<i>women maybe... might be</i>

trying different foods,

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:03.140
going on roller coasters,

1:06:03.240 --> 1:06:06.420
uh, or-- or having a sex life,
you know, an active one.

1:06:06.520 --> 1:06:09.740

<i>to-- to reawaken.</i>

1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:16.480
Elaine and Stephen
had a lot of...

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:19.600
fun together.

1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:25.820
Elaine gave Stephen a ride
in a hot-air balloon,

1:06:25.920 --> 1:06:27.820
as a birthday present.

1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:35.980
<i>Him sort of grinning</i>
<i>all over his face,</i>

1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:37.420

1:06:37.520 --> 1:06:40.060

She enjoyed the same sort of
jokes, the same sort of...

1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:01.740
silliness.

1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:03.700
<i>He had a party.</i>

1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:07.380
<i>And, he and Elaine were</i>
<i>doing a conga.</i>

1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:09.460
You know, leading it
around the room,

1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:12.420
Stephen in a wheelchair.

1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:15.300
And I can't see
Jane doing that.

1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:19.340
<i>David: Stephen loved a party.</i>

1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:22.140
<i>And he loved to surprise</i>
<i>people.</i>

1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:24.060
<i>At his 60th birthday,</i>

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:28.980
in burst the Can-Can girls
from the Folies Bergere.

1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:35.180
<i>He brought the whole</i>
<i>troop over.</i>

1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:39.660
<i>And we have all these ladies</i>
<i> in their famous frilly dresses,</i>

1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:42.000
<i>dancing around the tables.</i>

1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:47.640
<i> I mean that was... so Stephen.</i>

1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:52.860
He had a very mischievous
sense of humour.

1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:08.860
<i>Marika: Theoretical physics</i>
<i>is a world which is,</i>

1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:10.960
<i>is full of men.</i>

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:16.780
Stephen had two female
doctoral students.

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:19.920
And I think he was very
supportive to both of us.

1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:26.660
<i>But there was</i>
<i>a certain amount of</i>

1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:29.340
attitudes towards women
which wouldn't be

1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:32.220
so common these days.

1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:35.020
<i>He had on his wall, you know,</i>
<i>I think it's quite well known</i>

1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:36.940
<i>he had a picture of</i>
<i>Marilyn Monroe.</i>

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:38.940
<i>He liked it when there</i>
<i>was a beautiful woman</i>

1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:40.780
who was serving him
in a restaurant.

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:42.820
He'd always like
to sort of smile.

1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:47.020
I wouldn't say qu-- quite flirt,
but almost-- almost that.

1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:49.520
<i>He enjoyed</i>
<i>the company of women.</i>

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:53.820
This was not something
that particularly bothered me,

1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:57.620
because it-- it didn't reflect
any disrespect towards women,

1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:59.420
it didn't mean
that he didn't consider

1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:02.780
women as intellectual equals.

1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:06.440
<i>But it's also a fact that</i>
<i>he didn't hire many women.</i>

1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:16.980
Stephen was very keen that
he and I would work together

1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:19.300
using String Theory
to understand

1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:22.020
properties of black holes.

1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:24.980
<i>He saw this as a way of</i>
<i>unlocking the puzzles</i>

1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:29.020
<i>that he had been trying</i>
<i>to solve for 20 years.</i>

1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:31.340
<i>Roger: He was perhaps a bit</i>
<i>over-optimistic</i>

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:34.640
<i>about how close we were</i>
<i>to that Theory Of Everything.</i>

1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:40.060
But you can see him,
his whole life,

1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:42.340
going for this horizon,

1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:45.780
<i>trying to come up with this</i>
<i>mathematical picture</i>

1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:47.880
<i>of how the universe works.</i>

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:55.260
Many people... judge that
Stephen's best work

1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:57.740
was created before he was 30.

1:09:57.840 --> 1:09:59.840
<i>I'm not sure that's right.</i>

1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:03.300
<i>I saw no diminution</i>

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:06.820
<i>in his quest to know...</i>

1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:09.640
<i>the structure of</i>
<i>space and time.</i>

1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:14.620
I think one of the enormously
likeable things, um...

1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:16.100
very sort of
heart warming things,

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:17.620
about my father as a person,

1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:21.440
is that he is in many ways
the opposite of...

1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:25.140
an ivory tower genius.

1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:27.020
<i>He-- he's a real human being</i>

1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:28.940
<i> who has all these experiences,</i>

1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:30.500
<i>has this brilliant mind,</i>

1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:32.620
<i>works incredibly hard,</i>

1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:36.620
gets things wrong,
picks up, carries on...

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:40.380
<i>It's this never giving up</i>
<i>quality about him.</i>

1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:43.420
<i> He was more or less able to do</i>

1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:46.100
<i>most of the things</i>
<i>he wanted to do.</i>

1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:50.520
Although, there were some
significant health collapses.

1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:56.540
Well, I first met Stephen
completely by chance

1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:58.900
<i>on an aeroplane coming back</i>

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.260
<i>from... Greece in 1998.</i>

1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:07.460
The nurse was feeding him
some liquidised food.

1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.900
But I could see
this liquid food

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.660
being coughed out of
the tracheostomy tube.

1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:16.720
<i>And this alarmed me</i>
<i>considerably.</i>

1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:23.620
El-- Elaine asked me if I would
visit them at home,

1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:26.560
and-- and discuss
the situation a bit more.

1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:33.660
<i>I could see very clearly that</i>

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:37.580
<i>his larynx was functionless.</i>

1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:42.500
<i>It wasn't able to close</i>
<i>in any fashion.</i>

1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:45.500
<i>Any food that</i>
<i>went down his gullet,</i>

1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:49.020
<i>would then go into his lungs.</i>

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:53.820
He would literally have drowned
in any food or liquid

1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:56.360
<i>that he had</i>
<i>then been given.</i>

1:11:57.680 --> 1:11:59.900
<i>We had to separate his</i>

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.840
<i>food way and airway</i>
<i>permanently.</i>

1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:06.860
David admitted
that the odds of me

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:10.860
surviving the reconstructed
throat surgery were slim.

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:14.820
But then we also knew
that my odds of enjoying life

1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:17.260
<i>or surviving for much longer</i>

1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:19.620
<i>were also minimal.</i>

1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:22.640
<i>I decided to have</i>
<i>the operation.</i>

1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:28.020
<i>David: When you have</i>
<i>a laryngectomy,</i>

1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:31.220
<i>you breathe directly</i>
<i>into your lungs,</i>

1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:35.820
so, one of the advantages was
he could breathe more easily.

1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:38.820
And as he was
very fond of saying it,

1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:41.580
it meant that he could carry on
breathing on his own

1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:44.320
<i>for the next number of years.</i>

1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:51.500
<i>Elaine was an integral part</i>
<i>of this decision.</i>

1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:54.740
She understood
the-- the physiology

1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:56.880
and anatomy of the problem.

1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:04.220
<i> Stephen: My marriage to Elaine</i>
<i>was passionate</i>

1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:06.220
<i>and tempestuous.</i>

1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:09.820
<i>We had our ups and downs.</i>

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:14.080
<i> But Elaine being a nurse saved</i>
<i>my life on several occasions.</i>

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:18.620
<i>Lucy: Elaine definitely</i>
<i>liked some people</i>

1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:20.720
<i>and didn't like other people.</i>

1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:28.040
I went out to stay
with my dad in California.

1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:33.620
<i>And I woke up in the night.</i>

1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:36.420
<i>And I could hear Elaine</i>
<i>shouting at my father saying,</i>

1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:38.740
"Tell her to leave,
she has to go."

1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:40.300
And, I could hear
my father saying,

1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:42.520
"Please let her stay,
she is my daughter."

1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:50.220
<i>So, I put my trainers on,</i>
<i>I climbed out the window.</i>

1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:52.740
<i>I was on the ground floor</i>
<i>and I went jogging around</i>

1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:56.080
<i>L.A. until the sun rose.</i>

1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:00.820
I talked to my father many times
about his relationship

1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:04.180
with Elaine and I said to him
how worried I was for him.

1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:05.620
<i>He just said,</i>

1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:09.280
<i>"Please just put up with her</i>
<i>for my sake."</i>

1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:16.780
<i>Robert: I was aware</i>
<i>that there were</i>

1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:20.820
<i> challenges in-- in my father's</i>
<i>relationship with Elaine.</i>

1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:22.920
I, um...

1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:27.880
heard about things
from other people.

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:35.280
<i>It was... worrying</i>
<i>and confusing.</i>

1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:48.740
<i>Tim: I overheard Elaine</i>
<i>when she was, uh,</i>

1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:51.040
<i>feeding my-- my dad</i>
<i>his breakfast.</i>

1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:55.980
She was saying...

1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:58.260
things to him that were

1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:01.220
uh, what I would think of as

1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:04.960
<i> put downs, sarcastic comments.</i>

1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:10.660
<i>But I didn't understand</i>
<i>whether this was some form of</i>

1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:14.580
role play between them, that--
that was accepted on both sides

1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:17.700
and which they would
snap out of.

1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:19.460
<i>I've never talked to anyone</i>
<i>about that.</i>

1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:21.820
<i>That was 23 years ago.</i>

1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:24.840
Your head's falling forward,
come on.

1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:27.920
Did you say no to me?

1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:40.460
<i>Man on TV: Cambridge here, police</i>
<i>say they are talking</i>

1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:43.000
<i>to a number of people</i>
<i>about the allegations.</i>

1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:50.580
<i>The professor himself is</i>
<i>currently in hospital</i>

1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:53.480
<i>recovering from an unrelated</i>
<i>chest infection.</i>

1:15:56.040 --> 1:15:58.100
<i>Lucy: The phone rang at</i>
<i>7 o'clock in the morning,</i>

1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:01.380
on the 2nd of November,
uh, 1999.

1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:02.940
And I thought it would be
somebody calling

1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:04.620
to say Happy Birthday,
and it wasn't.

1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:06.820
And it was somebody who worked
for my father saying,

1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:08.580
<i>"Elaine has broken your</i>
<i>father's arm."</i>

1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:10.460
<i>"You have to do something</i>
<i>about this."</i>

1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:14.420
<i> I went to see him and he said,</i>
<i>"No, no, that didn't happen."</i>

1:16:14.520 --> 1:16:16.520
<i>"She didn't break my arm."</i>

1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:19.740
I was just appalled
and very saddened

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:23.420
to find that Stephen's situation
over all these long years

1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:27.440
has been far worse
than any of us ever imagined.

1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:32.020
<i>Man on TV: Police say they</i>
<i> would also like to talk to him,</i>

1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:34.620
<i>at his convenience.</i>

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:37.480
I was very concerned about him.

1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:40.620
Very concerned about him
particularly

1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:42.380
when I went to talk
to him because

1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:44.880
<i>he had bruises</i>
<i>all over his face.</i>

1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:49.600
<i>He wouldn't tell me</i>
<i>how he got them.</i>

1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:55.660
I tried to-- to
communicate with him.

1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:00.260
But it didn't... end up with

1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:04.040
clarity which
I found frustrating.

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:07.620
<i>Man on TV: Physicist</i>
<i>Stephen Hawking tonight</i>

1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:09.420
<i>dismissed reports</i>
<i>that he's been assaulted</i>

1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:11.800
<i> and abused as completely false.</i>

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:18.020
I really don't know what to say

1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:20.420
about his point of view on this

1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:22.920
because he didn't
explain it to me.

1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:27.320
<i>He chose to tell me</i>
<i>it wasn't happening.</i>

1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:31.680
And so, why?

1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:39.180
<i>I think she enforced his</i>
<i>dependence on her...</i>

1:17:39.280 --> 1:17:42.100
<i>as in you know without me</i>
<i>you'll just have nobody</i>

1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:44.200
<i>to look after you.</i>

1:17:54.320 --> 1:17:58.660
The situation regarding the
allegations is very distressing.

1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:02.140
They were thoroughly
investigated.

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:05.440
Stephen absolutely denied them.

1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:11.500
<i>You're looking at a situation</i>
<i>where with paralysis,</i>

1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:14.220
the bones become extremely
thin and fragile.

1:18:14.320 --> 1:18:16.340
You know,
you just look at him...

1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:18.520
and something broke.

1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:23.820
<i>I didn't believe</i>
<i>the allegations...</i>

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:25.920
<i>at all.</i>

1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:42.420
<i>Lucy: After the enquiry</i>
<i>was dropped,</i>

1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:43.980
<i> I just didn't know what to do.</i>

1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:46.080
<i>It was absolute torture.</i>

1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:50.700
People were deeply
suspicious of me, um...

1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:55.560
It was a really very upsetting,
damaging and difficult time.

1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:01.500
At the same time, my son was
diagnosed as severely autistic.

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:03.540
Uh, when I got divorced and...

1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:05.980
my career sort of packed up
and left me.

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:09.620
<i>I drank too much</i>
<i>and I needed to stop.</i>

1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:11.980
<i>In the middle of all of this,</i>

1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:14.060
<i>he wrote this letter.</i>

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:16.560
And he wrote to me and he said,
"I love you very much."

1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:21.720
"And I've been
in a dark place, too."

1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:26.940
"And I want you to--
I want you to come back."

1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:29.560
"And, um,
it was time to try again."

1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:39.940
It was quite a few years
after the allegations,

1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:42.420
<i>that Stephen</i>
<i>and Elaine broke up.</i>

1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:46.060
I don't know whether
those allegations

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:49.260
had anything to do with it.

1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:51.300
<i>But I could see</i>
<i>the difficulties</i>

1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:53.020
<i>that were occurring.</i>

1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:57.020
<i>Stephen's disability was</i>
<i>becoming difficult to manage.</i>

1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:01.220
He was spending far more time
in hospital.

1:20:01.320 --> 1:20:02.980
<i>He got extremely tired.</i>

1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:07.820
He was... putting his energy
into his work

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:12.000
which didn't leave much left
over for anything else.

1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:19.780
<i>Jonathan Wood: When he was</i>
<i>working, he was able to...</i>

1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:22.540
<i>go at this crazy pace and...</i>

1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:25.420
<i>achieve all these things.</i>

1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:27.020
Partly I think
because of the people

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:28.820
and the support he had around him.

1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:31.520
I spent more time with him
than I spent with my wife.

1:20:35.680 --> 1:20:39.260
I haven't really talked
about Stephen...

1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:42.860
um, to anyone since his death.

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:45.660
And it just felt, um...

1:20:45.760 --> 1:20:47.960
it still feels painful, I think.

1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:56.940
<i>It was a very</i>
<i>laborious process,</i>

1:20:57.040 --> 1:20:59.800
<i>getting him hoisted</i>
<i>out of bed...</i>

1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:04.740
Being assisted in the bathroom,

1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:08.680
<i>getting ready and fed,</i>
<i>having breakfast.</i>

1:21:10.280 --> 1:21:13.520
<i> I guess nobody really saw that.</i>

1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:23.780
<i>The voice synthesiser was</i>
<i>an extension of himself</i>

1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:26.580
and then,
because I was maintaining

1:21:26.680 --> 1:21:28.420
that and enabling him to travel,

1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:31.600
<i>I was in some way</i>
<i>an extension of him.</i>

1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:36.520
<i>As I would view</i>
<i>his care team...</i>

1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:40.380
<i>it was a very</i>
<i>personal relationship</i>

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:42.640
<i>for everybody</i>
<i>that worked with him.</i>

1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:47.880
<i>It transcended</i>
<i>that of a colleague.</i>

1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:54.520
I think we were his family.

1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:06.880
<i>Lucy: It's really nice to be</i>
<i>back in his life.</i>

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:11.040
<i> You know, coming back together</i>
<i>again as a family.</i>

1:22:13.080 --> 1:22:15.220
We-- we really,
you know started getting on,

1:22:15.320 --> 1:22:17.220
we started talking a lot.

1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:19.360
<i>We started working together.</i>

1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:27.020
<i>All the time he was pushing</i>
<i>back the boundaries</i>

1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:30.480
<i>of this is what I can do.</i>

1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:35.220
And it was completely different,
you know, wow,

1:22:35.320 --> 1:22:38.060
I was like, "Wow, this is...
God, things have moved on."

1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:48.740
<i>Jonathan Wood: He enjoyed</i>

1:22:48.840 --> 1:22:51.580
<i>the celebrity side of it,</i>
<i>definitely.</i>

1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:54.020
<i>He also saw it as a means of</i>

1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:57.440
communicating his physics
to a wider audience.

1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:02.000
Hello, Beijing,
can you hear me?

1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:06.620
<i>Stephen: Our picture of</i>
<i>the universe has changed</i>

1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:09.260
<i>a great deal</i>
<i>in the last 50 years</i>

1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:13.440
<i>and I'm happy if I have</i>
<i>made a small contribution.</i>

1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:22.900
<i>Lucy: In 2009, we got the</i>
<i>invitation from Barack Obama</i>

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.340
<i>to go to the White House and</i>
<i>receive his Medal Of Freedom.</i>

1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:27.780
<i>By then,</i>
<i>you know, we were worried</i>

1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:30.540
<i>his health had deteriorated</i>
<i>quite a lot.</i>

1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:33.140
And he said to me, "I really
want to go, what do you think?"

1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:36.260
And I had to say, "Do you
understand that if we do this,

1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:39.500
there is quite a big chance
that this trip could kill you,

1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.060
that you may die in them?"

1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:42.500
And he said,

1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:44.820
"I don't mind dying
in the White House provided,

1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:47.060
<i>I've met Barack and Michelle</i>
<i>first."</i>

1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:50.020
Professor Stephen Hawking
was a brilliant man

1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:52.420
and a mediocre student.

1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:58.820
When he lost his balance and
tumbled down a flight of stairs,

1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:01.340
diagnosed with
a rare disease and told

1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:03.700
he had just a few years to live,

1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:06.540
he chose to live
with new purpose.

1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:10.020
And happily in the four decades
since he has become

1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:12.440
<i>one of the world's</i>
<i>leading scientists.</i>

1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:18.700
As time wore on, he became
little bit more circumspect

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:22.860
in terms of what
opportunities he took up.

1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:25.060
<i>The opening ceremony of</i>
<i>the Paralympics</i>

1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:26.780
<i>is obviously a notable</i>

1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:29.660
<i>occasion where he felt like</i>

1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:33.300
he could take that sort of
showmanship and combine it with,

1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:35.400
with a message.

1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:39.460
<i>Stephen: Ever since</i>
<i>the dawn of civilisation,</i>

1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:42.140
<i>people have craved</i>
<i>for an understanding</i>

1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:44.940
<i>of the underlying</i>
<i>order of the world.</i>

1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:49.620
<i>Lucy: It was just electric.</i>

1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:54.220
I mean, the whole of that stadium
just rose to their feet

1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:56.020
when he came out
and started speaking.

1:24:56.120 --> 1:24:59.500
It was so beautiful.

1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:02.900
<i>Jonathan Wood:</i>
<i>Delivering a message of hope,</i>

1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.300
<i>was important to him.</i>

1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:07.700
However difficult
life may seem,

1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:10.420
there is always
something you can do

1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:12.300
and succeed at.

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:15.020
He'd had these struggles
through his life

1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:19.220
and that he wanted to know,
he wanted people to know that...

1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:22.540
they could,
they could do things.

1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:25.880
They could achieve things.
They shouldn't be held back.

1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:31.900
The games provide
an opportunity

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.580
for athletes to excel

1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:38.340
to stretch themselves and become
outstanding in their field.

1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:41.420
So, let us together
celebrate excellence,

1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:43.980
friendship and respect.

1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:46.100
Good luck to you all.

1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:00.620
Stephen Hawking, uh, certainly
was famous for his physics

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:04.420
but I like to say that
he's classical archetype hero.

1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:08.020
People said,
"If he can face that challenge,

1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:10.260
then I can face my challenge."

1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:12.360
That's what a hero is for.

1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:15.620
When we look back on
Stephen Hawking's legacy,

1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:19.700
I think it's quite
difficult to unpick

1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:24.300
the scientist from the person
because I think they're so...

1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:26.720
combined in people's minds.

1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:32.900
Things that had
previously been easy for him,

1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.420
were becoming harder
and harder.

1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:40.420
He was spending far more
time in hospital.

1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:43.280
It was just general systems...

1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:46.700
packing up slowly.

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:50.540
<i>His neurologist told him that</i>

1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:53.680
<i>there really was nothing more</i>
<i>they could do for him.</i>

1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:00.580
I found myself in a situation
with him where I had to-- to...

1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:02.540
basically explain to him that,

1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:04.820
he was now going
into palliative care.

1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:08.900
And that the doctors had said
he was now untreatable.

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.420
And that was probably
the biggest conversation

1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:13.620
he and I
ever had about it and...

1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:16.980
it seems ironic that-- that came
so late, you know,

1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:19.800
he was 75 by then.

1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:27.020
<i>Lucy: And, he said to me,</i>
<i>"I would like to go home</i>

1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:29.120
<i>to die now, please."</i>

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:44.980
I-- I had the opportunity
to spend quite a bit of time

1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:47.760
with my dad in the,
in the final few months.

1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:52.380
<i>It was just more about</i>
<i>being there</i>

1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:54.480
<i>and spending time together.</i>

1:27:56.120 --> 1:27:58.820
Seeing him, in-- in bed,

1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:00.260
uh, away from the chair,

1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:03.660
sort of helped foster a bit more
of a personal connection,

1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:06.420
because all of things around him
had been taken away

1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:08.680
<i>and it just-- just him again.</i>

1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:15.780
Uh, I was surprised at
how badly I took it.

1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:20.000
<i>This was something that I had</i>
<i>been expecting for 50 years.</i>

1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:24.920
And...

1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:29.120
it still hit me.

1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:36.340
<i>Lucy: Those last days, weeks,</i>
<i>it was lovely actually,</i>

1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:39.820
<i>just sitting there with him.</i>

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:42.820
<i>Unexpectedly, all this</i>
<i>snow fell</i>

1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:45.300
and I remember my father lying
in bed with...

1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:48.420
his curtains open,
so could see the snow.

1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:49.620
And my brother and I went out

1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:52.140
and built a snowman
in the garden.

1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:54.460
And the snowman was looking up,
we tilted his head,

1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:57.920
so that the snowman,
we made a snow astronomer.

1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:04.980
<i>Stephen: So, remember</i>
<i>to look up at the stars</i>

1:29:05.080 --> 1:29:07.080
<i>and not down at your feet.</i>

1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:12.340
<i>Try to make sense of what</i>
<i>you see and wonder about</i>

1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:14.680
<i> what makes the universe exist.</i>

1:29:17.360 --> 1:29:19.360
<i>Be curious.</i>
