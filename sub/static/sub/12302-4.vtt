WEBVTT

00:18.600 --> 00:19.601
Hey, nice trip Bob!

00:20.519 --> 00:21.645
Way to getting it close!

00:27.067 --> 00:27.609
Hey, what's going on?

00:28.152 --> 00:29.111
Who is this?

00:29.111 --> 00:30.112
Get off the green!

00:30.571 --> 00:31.196
Hey!

00:31.989 --> 00:33.866
Get the hell off the green.

00:35.743 --> 00:36.452
Call Security.

00:43.083 --> 00:43.667
Hey this is a private course!

00:50.841 --> 00:52.468
These kids on crack or something?

00:53.093 --> 00:55.471
Guys you're tearing up the fairway and the green,
get off the course!

01:07.774 --> 01:09.693
The best of all the lost arts.

01:10.736 --> 01:11.195
Look out!

01:11.195 --> 01:12.196
Whoa!

01:13.655 --> 01:14.990
The best of all the lost arts.

01:18.076 --> 01:20.037
The best of all the lost arts.

01:36.929 --> 01:38.096
Sweet lord.

01:52.319 --> 01:53.654
It was like Dawn of the Dead.

01:53.779 --> 01:54.780
Must've been a hundred of 'em.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.073
Yeah, they're called flash mobs.

01:56.114 --> 02:02.120
People are contacted by e-mail to show up
at a specific time and do something freaky
and then run off.

02:03.205 --> 02:05.958
You know, I'm going to have this officer
take the information from you.

02:06.333 --> 02:06.917
Great. Thank you.

02:12.506 --> 02:13.590
A flash mob.

02:14.174 --> 02:16.385
After the dust cleared,
the body was found
in the sand trap.

02:17.135 --> 02:18.720
Interesting. We got an I.D., Alexx?

02:19.221 --> 02:20.681
None.
He's just a kid.

02:21.765 --> 02:24.059
I'd guess 16... 17.

02:25.811 --> 02:28.188
Cromarty. That's an expensive label
for a teenager.

02:28.522 --> 02:30.649
Rigor says he's been here
at least nine hours.

02:32.276 --> 02:33.110
But no bruising.

02:33.568 --> 02:36.196
And no external injuries other than a nosebleed.

02:37.531 --> 02:38.657
What're the odds, huh?

02:39.241 --> 02:41.743
A hundred people throwing golf balls
at the site of a death?

02:42.035 --> 02:43.787
Those odds are very slim,
aren't they?

02:44.621 --> 02:48.333
So the question becomes, Alexx, was the mob
sent to draw us to the crime scene...

02:48.500 --> 02:51.586
Or sent to destroy it?

03:43.528 --> 03:44.279
"Mob".

03:45.446 --> 03:46.281
Eric.

03:47.156 --> 03:48.241
Found this next to the body.

03:50.451 --> 03:52.620
Looks like a belt clip
for a PDA of some kind.

03:54.205 --> 03:56.958
Clasp is broken. I'm thinking
it was forcibly removed.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.334
Indicates a struggle.

03:58.543 --> 04:03.047
Okay, let's collect all the information on the mob,
and let's connect it to the body.

04:03.339 --> 04:05.758
I will be back at the post.

04:11.472 --> 04:13.308
So these flash mobs
are the newest thing.

04:13.641 --> 04:15.310
Brainstorms of restless kids.

04:16.644 --> 04:22.650
One of 'em gets some idea, like converging
on a golf course, sends it out to a bunch of
other kids with nothing to do.

04:24.861 --> 04:28.364
But you know, every flash mob has a theme,
and I'm wondering what theirs was.

04:29.282 --> 04:30.325
How 'bout screwing with us?

04:30.858 --> 04:34.445
Golf balls have hundreds of dimples; it's
going to make it impossible to get a
usable print.

04:34.862 --> 04:36.447
I want to look
for distinguishable markings.

04:36.989 --> 04:38.157
They've all got
"mob" written on 'em.

04:38.908 --> 04:40.451
You take the bunker.
I'll take the green.

04:46.582 --> 04:48.751
- You have an I.D. yet, Alexx?
- No. Not yet.

04:49.377 --> 04:53.589
Do know he died with an empty stomach,
full bladder, strong smell of alcohol.

04:53.881 --> 04:57.176
- Respiratory failure?
- Wouldn't be the first teenager to drink
himself to death.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.471
So we agree that the mob makes
the circumstances suspicious.

05:00.805 --> 05:03.266
We'll play it as a murder until otherwise informed.
What else?

05:03.975 --> 05:04.767
Boy was an athlete.

05:05.810 --> 05:08.980
Knee surgery. Overdeveloped right arm.
I'm thinking tennis.

05:09.146 --> 05:11.440
- Okay. You just said knee surgery.
- Yeah.

05:11.691 --> 05:13.818
He may have an I.D., Alexx.
Check his knee.

05:25.830 --> 05:29.250
- Knee replacement. Possibly titanium.
- Bingo.

05:41.554 --> 05:43.639
Matched the serial number
to the patient record.

05:44.765 --> 05:47.852
Titanium knee belongs
to a Daniel Kleiner, 18.

05:48.311 --> 05:51.772
Family lives on Star Island.
Attends an exclusive prep school in Miami.

05:52.148 --> 05:53.274
Palm Crest Academy.

05:54.191 --> 05:55.943
That ritzy private high school
in the Grove?

05:56.110 --> 05:57.111
Yes, one and the same.

05:57.153 --> 06:00.531
We just traced one of the golf balls
to a student there, Chad Van Horn.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.491
His parents are overseas.

06:02.950 --> 06:05.244
Yes, but Chad is still in Miami.

06:07.371 --> 06:08.122
What's up?

06:08.164 --> 06:11.500
You were at the flash mob this morning,
at the Miami Palms Country Club.

06:12.043 --> 06:13.127
Half the senior class
was there.

06:13.419 --> 06:17.173
Yes, did half the senior class see
Danny Kleiner dead in the sand trap?

06:17.631 --> 06:18.632
I don't know.

06:19.342 --> 06:21.469
I just figured that was some totally
messed up part of the stunt.

06:22.053 --> 06:25.848
See, we believe that somebody
from the stunt killed Danny.

06:26.724 --> 06:29.060
Look, I was just one of the sheeple.

06:29.060 --> 06:31.729
It's not like I originated the mob.

06:31.771 --> 06:33.064
Who did originate it?

06:33.105 --> 06:36.484
No idea.
Just read the text message
off my cell.

06:36.734 --> 06:38.194
We're going to need your cell phone.

06:39.487 --> 06:41.739
Did Danny have problems
with anyone in school?

06:42.323 --> 06:42.990
No...

06:47.912 --> 06:50.873
He did get into it last week
with Justin Gillespie.

06:51.165 --> 06:52.083
- Over what?
- I don't know.

06:52.291 --> 06:53.626
Did it make it to the principal?

06:54.293 --> 06:55.336
You mean "Headmaster"?

06:55.336 --> 06:57.088
If you like.

06:57.546 --> 06:58.714
Everything makes it to him.

06:58.714 --> 07:00.591
That's how he keeps his job.

07:07.014 --> 07:10.226
In my 15 years as headmaster, we've never had
police searching the students.

07:10.309 --> 07:13.479
Shouldn't your investigation have started
on the golf course, where this thing happened?

07:13.896 --> 07:15.022
Actually, it did.

07:15.064 --> 07:20.694
As it turns out, our victim had
an argument with one of your students,
a Justin Gillespie.

07:20.694 --> 07:23.072
Oh, look, that
was nothing more
than horseplay.

07:23.072 --> 07:28.410
In addition, 50 other seniors from this school
were also present at the mob where
we found the boy's body.

07:28.452 --> 07:30.704
Look, interviews are
out of the question.

07:30.746 --> 07:32.957
I'm only interested
in their cell phones.

07:33.198 --> 07:36.535
No. Invasion of privacy.
Parents'll have my head, pull their kids.

07:36.535 --> 07:40.456
I understand, and I'll do everything
in my power to protect you. Okay?

07:40.497 --> 07:46.045
Lieutenant, I think you would be surprised
how aware these kids are of their rights.

07:46.045 --> 07:46.587
No, I wouldn't.

07:48.255 --> 07:48.672
Have a good day.

07:51.592 --> 07:56.096
Please have your cell phones and PDAs
out and turned on. I'll only need them
for one minute

07:59.558 --> 08:00.184
Thank you.

08:00.309 --> 08:01.018
I'm sorry to hover.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.853
It's no problem at all.

08:02.895 --> 08:05.355
Headmaster wants to make sure
you're not trampling anyone's rights.

08:07.900 --> 08:08.817
How we doing, Tyler?

08:08.817 --> 08:09.943
Uh... getting there.

08:09.985 --> 08:16.366
On the message, I see
time, place and instructions

08:16.366 --> 08:18.786
but I can't figure out a reason
for the dates.

08:18.827 --> 08:24.500
Flash point entry is
determined by month of birth.
Makes it look more random.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.170
I think you know a little too
much about these flash mobs.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.547
Oh, please. I do not even have time
to go to the mall.

08:58.534 --> 09:00.077
Huh. I got the originator.

09:00.118 --> 09:02.663
Sent his message at 11:10 last night.

09:02.663 --> 09:03.664
Great. Give me a name.

09:03.664 --> 09:05.207
Justin Gillespie.

09:05.207 --> 09:06.667
He's the mob originator.

09:06.667 --> 09:10.921
Yes, and he's
a familiar name, too.

09:10.921 --> 09:14.341
And one girl who didn't show up for
cell phone line up: a Sarah Mitchell.

09:14.341 --> 09:18.470
Maybe she has something on her cell phone
she doesn't want us to find out about.

09:18.470 --> 09:22.724
- Okay. You take Justin. I'll take Sarah.
- Okay

09:22.724 --> 09:27.980
Sarah Mitchell, you want to tell us why you
didn't turn your phone in to our CSI today?

09:27.980 --> 09:29.856
'Cause I don't know anything
about Danny getting killed.

09:29.856 --> 09:32.985
Then you won't mind giving us your cell
phone right now.

09:34.653 --> 09:35.112
I don't have it.

09:35.112 --> 09:39.533
I sold it this morning to a guy outside
a coffee house on the way back from a flash mob.

09:39.533 --> 09:40.534
I need money.
My parents cut me off.

09:41.660 --> 09:44.037
They cut you off 'cause they discovered
you're using meth, Sarah?

09:48.000 --> 09:48.792
Hey, you can't do that.

09:48.834 --> 09:53.839
Well, yes, I can. it's in plain sight,
and it appears to have a little dab
of blood on it.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.924
Can you explain that?

09:58.135 --> 10:00.095
I don't know how that got there.

10:00.095 --> 10:02.139
Our victim was bleeding.

10:02.139 --> 10:09.104
Yes, and the spatter is consistent with trauma,
and that means you will be taking
an automobile ride with us.

10:18.739 --> 10:22.034
Justin, we have evidence you originated
the stunt at the golf course today.

10:22.034 --> 10:23.076
Yeah, that's right.

10:23.076 --> 10:26.163
But nobody saw you at the flash
mob this morning.

10:26.163 --> 10:29.124
Yeah, well, calling 'em's
actually more fun than going.

10:29.124 --> 10:31.251
And you didn't invite your friend
Stephanie?

10:31.251 --> 10:33.587
I knew she wouldn't go.
Her dad's the Headmaster.

10:33.587 --> 10:37.716
It's not that. It's exam week.
I can either study or have fun,
not both.

10:39.843 --> 10:42.304
We understand you had a beef with
the victim last week.

10:42.846 --> 10:45.557
Why don't you tell us a little bit
about that?

10:45.557 --> 10:47.725
I don't remember that.

10:47.725 --> 10:50.186
That's your answer?
You don't remember?

10:53.606 --> 10:55.608
Got some sand here.

10:56.526 --> 10:58.736
Yeah, probably from the beach.

10:58.736 --> 11:00.989
Then you won't mind if
I take a little, would you?

11:00.989 --> 11:03.616
Be my guest.
The housekeeper'll love it.

11:03.658 --> 11:05.577
So, this altercation
with Danny...

11:05.577 --> 11:07.620
I didn't give police
permission to enter my house.

11:07.620 --> 11:12.000
Calleigh Duquesne, CSI.
Your son invited us in.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.128
Well, he has
nothing more to say.

11:15.128 --> 11:17.589
I'd like you
off my property now.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.507
As you like.

11:23.761 --> 11:24.679
Thanks

11:24.679 --> 11:26.764
That who I think it is?

11:26.764 --> 11:29.517
Martin Gillespie, one of Miami's
best defense attorneys.

11:29.517 --> 11:32.437
That would explain why his son's answers
were so smooth.

11:32.437 --> 11:34.689
And why our job
just got a lot harder.

11:43.738 --> 11:45.906
Is Danny's Kleiner's
tox report in yet?

11:45.948 --> 11:51.662
Confirmed extremely high levels
of gamma hydroxybutric acid
in our Danny boy.

11:51.662 --> 11:55.624
GHB. Date rape drug?

11:55.624 --> 11:57.126
Males use it to get high.

11:57.126 --> 12:00.588
Trace Lab found it in the scotch
left at the crime scene, too.

12:00.588 --> 12:01.213
What were the levels?

12:01.213 --> 12:04.550
Equates to almost
five ounces.

12:04.550 --> 12:08.721
That sounds like more than getting high.
That sounds like somebody
dosed the scotch.

12:08.721 --> 12:11.599
Which is why my determination
is "homicide."

12:14.727 --> 12:15.853
Anything on Danny's clothes?

12:15.853 --> 12:18.522
Our Danny was a real player.

12:18.522 --> 12:20.816
Found some red lipstick
on his boxer shorts.

12:20.816 --> 12:21.817
Really?

12:21.817 --> 12:24.820
Yes, but the components were a little strange.

12:24.820 --> 12:29.992
"Ginger, cinnamon, oil of wintergreen..."
That's lip plumper.

12:29.992 --> 12:30.993
Lip what?

12:32.203 --> 12:36.874
It's the latest in beauty trickery.

12:36.874 --> 12:39.293
What's the purpose?

12:39.293 --> 12:41.087
To look like Angelina Jolie.

12:41.087 --> 12:43.422
Ah... Like that.

12:43.422 --> 12:45.174
Did you determine
what's in the tread?

12:45.174 --> 12:49.428
Yeah. It's a unique mixture, actually.
Take a look.

12:51.472 --> 12:53.307
Ground oyster shells.

12:53.307 --> 12:54.975
From what?

12:54.975 --> 12:58.854
It's a gardening material. Landscapers
use it to make pathways.

12:58.854 --> 13:03.734
I remember seeing the stuff
around the faculty apartments.

13:03.734 --> 13:08.322
Thinking that maybe our Danny was
taking some private tutoring lessons?

13:08.322 --> 13:11.117
The lip plumper makes it very private.

13:11.117 --> 13:13.119
You want to go back to school?

13:17.957 --> 13:18.999
Please come in.

13:20.209 --> 13:22.711
That's nice lipstick,
Ms. Mancini.

13:22.711 --> 13:24.130
Is it Lip Sting?

13:26.006 --> 13:27.133
How could you tell?

13:27.133 --> 13:30.052
We found traces of it
on Danny Kleiner's boxer shorts.

13:30.052 --> 13:35.141
Surely I'm not the only woman on campus
who wears that kind of lipstick.

13:35.141 --> 13:37.101
Only faculty member.
We checked.

13:37.142 --> 13:42.189
We also found evidence on Danny's shoes
that puts him in this building very recently.

13:49.405 --> 13:51.407
Danny was 18.

13:51.407 --> 13:52.783
Legally an adult.

13:52.783 --> 13:54.410
When was the last time
you saw Danny?

13:54.410 --> 13:56.245
Last night.

13:56.245 --> 13:59.248
He came over at around 7:00.
We...

14:06.630 --> 14:10.175
Then I took a shower around 8:00,
and when I came out, he was gone.

14:10.175 --> 14:11.051
Where was he going?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.678
I don't know.

14:12.678 --> 14:14.930
I don't ask him those questions.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.307
It's easier on the heart.

14:17.141 --> 14:19.602
Danny was dosed with GHB.
You're a chemistry teacher.

14:19.602 --> 14:20.686
You could make that
blindfolded.

14:21.145 --> 14:24.356
I didn't.
You're welcome to check my lab.

14:24.356 --> 14:26.150
We'll do that.

14:28.569 --> 14:32.364
Is every incoming order from Ms. Mancini's
chem lab logged in here?

14:33.949 --> 14:37.494
Couple years ago some brat tried to order
explosive material through the lab.

14:37.494 --> 14:42.041
Ever since, security double
checks all deliveries.

14:42.041 --> 14:47.463
But we only found one component of GHB,
sodium hydroxide, and you can find
that in any lab.

14:47.463 --> 14:50.466
You ever find GHB
anywhere else on campus?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.011
Nope.

14:54.011 --> 14:55.220
Weekend guys might've.

14:55.220 --> 15:00.601
Any contraband we find we write a report
and turn it into Headmaster Brooks.

15:02.311 --> 15:03.771
I'd like to see those reports.

15:29.046 --> 15:29.546
Valera.

15:29.546 --> 15:30.214
Hey, Lieutenant.

15:30.214 --> 15:33.092
Does the blood on the baggie
match the victim's?

15:33.092 --> 15:34.051
Danny Kleiner?

15:34.051 --> 15:35.052
Blood's from a female.

15:35.052 --> 15:37.012
How about the tweaker girl?

15:37.012 --> 15:42.893
I ran it, and no, so I ran it against
the Forensic and Missing Persons Index.
Came up to a Madonna Arias.

15:42.893 --> 15:46.438
Parents reported her missing
yesterday. Nice address.

15:46.438 --> 15:48.649
According to the report,
she was in med school.

15:48.649 --> 15:50.442
No connection to Palm Crest Academy.

15:51.777 --> 15:53.570
Her name is Madonna Arias.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.155
That's her blood on the baggie?

15:55.656 --> 15:56.490
Do you know who she is?

15:57.991 --> 15:59.118
No.

15:59.618 --> 16:00.619
I never seen her.

16:00.619 --> 16:04.206
Sarah, I need to know where you cop your dope,
and I need to know right now.

16:07.793 --> 16:10.963
I never see a dealer. A runner,
some guy in a hoodie, comes down to the curb

16:10.963 --> 16:13.132
and takes the money and comes back with the baggie.

16:14.091 --> 16:15.008
Okay, good.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.343
I need his address.

16:38.740 --> 16:39.867
Urban guard dogs.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.743
Yes. With feathers.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.262
22... 23...24.

17:01.555 --> 17:02.472
That's where we're going.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.229
Door's open.

17:18.739 --> 17:20.031
Go right.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.494
Someone runs a nice little
business out of here.

17:25.494 --> 17:28.999
Place to sit. Bags for a...

17:28.999 --> 17:30.000
Shh.

17:40.552 --> 17:41.511
Come out of there.

17:45.015 --> 17:45.849
Who are you?

17:45.891 --> 17:48.477
Raul Arias. I'm looking
for my sister.

17:48.477 --> 17:49.478
Madonna?

17:49.478 --> 17:50.437
I have a picture.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.313
He's clear.

17:51.313 --> 17:53.732
What would your sister
be doing here?

17:53.732 --> 17:55.567
She buys her drugs from this building.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.611
I've followed her
here before.

17:57.611 --> 18:00.155
Did you tell that
to Missing Persons, Raul?

18:00.155 --> 18:02.074
My parents wouldn't let me.

18:02.074 --> 18:06.495
They're Argentinean. You know,
too much pride.

18:10.415 --> 18:12.250
There's a weird smell in here.

18:13.502 --> 18:14.711
- From the meth?
- Yes

18:14.711 --> 18:17.547
Here's what I want you to do go
outside with an officer, Raul.

18:22.177 --> 18:23.970
Looks like blunt force spatter.

18:24.012 --> 18:25.430
Yes, it does.

18:25.472 --> 18:30.310
And that copper smell is actually
the iron in the hemoglobin.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.771
So that means
there must be...

18:32.771 --> 18:36.233
a lot more blood somewhere.

18:44.866 --> 18:46.743
That puts the victim right here.

18:46.743 --> 18:48.620
So where's the rest
of the blood?

18:48.620 --> 18:50.497
There's no blood trail,
is there?

18:50.497 --> 18:53.333
No, too difficult
to carry out a body.

18:53.333 --> 18:58.880
They had to look for something fast
... and simple.

19:01.591 --> 19:05.470
Fast and simple.

19:06.430 --> 19:07.764
You mean, like gravity?

19:37.262 --> 19:38.044
- Horatio.
- Is that her?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.504
Hang onto this.

19:39.504 --> 19:40.505
Is that my sister?

19:40.506 --> 19:41.391
Is that her?

19:41.392 --> 19:43.357
I think it may be.

19:43.358 --> 19:45.784
Hey hold up a minute

19:45.785 --> 19:47.376
How'd you get those cuts
on your hands?

19:47.377 --> 19:50.695
...I sculpt.

19:50.696 --> 19:53.122
Granite, marble. I've got a studio
in South Beach.

19:53.123 --> 19:54.560
Why is your shirt torn up?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.167
I snagged it.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.845
On what?

19:57.846 --> 19:58.594
I forget.

19:58.595 --> 20:00.962
I want that shirt
to the lab right now.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.298
What does your scope say?

20:07.299 --> 20:09.793
Same as the mass spec says.

20:09.794 --> 20:12.122
Raul was in a struggle
with his sister.

20:16.413 --> 20:17.972
You locate the wallet
in the Dumpster?

20:17.973 --> 20:21.626
Didn't turned up, but I'm going to check
all her credit cards, cover all the bases.

20:24.233 --> 20:27.059
It's called an exchange
of fibers, Raul.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.297
And it means you were in an altercation
with your sister.

20:29.298 --> 20:29.927
I didn't kill her.

20:29.927 --> 20:33.637
We found you at the murder scene 50 feet
from where her body was dumped.

20:33.638 --> 20:36.423
If you didn't kill her, I need help
from you right now.

20:36.424 --> 20:38.715
I saw her the day
she disappeared.

20:38.716 --> 20:42.074
She came to my apartment,
starving.

20:42.075 --> 20:42.924
From the meth.

20:42.925 --> 20:46.171
You'd think that these dealers would
at least want to keep their junkies fed.

20:46.672 --> 20:47.317
Please no please

20:47.318 --> 20:47.949
Give that back to me!

20:47.950 --> 20:49.679
Give that back!

20:49.680 --> 20:50.562
Raul that's mine

20:50.563 --> 20:51.969
You bring this to my studio?!

20:51.970 --> 20:52.629
Raul, do not do that!

20:52.630 --> 20:53.770
No. No more.

20:53.788 --> 20:55.152
Please. Please...

20:55.153 --> 20:57.364
Raul, please don't
do that

20:59.038 --> 21:01.376
You're my sister, I love you.

21:01.377 --> 21:03.440
You don't know what you've done,
you fool!

21:07.517 --> 21:13.848
You don't know what it's like to watch someone
so beautiful be ruined by a drug.

21:15.803 --> 21:18.384
You don't know.

21:23.618 --> 21:25.219
I didn't kill her.

21:31.797 --> 21:33.063
I ran those credit cards.

21:33.064 --> 21:38.726
Looks like Madonna Arias charged $500
worth of gas since yesterday afternoon.

21:40.103 --> 21:42.272
Interesting ability
for a dead woman.

21:42.273 --> 21:43.525
You get an address?

21:43.526 --> 21:44.557
Better.

21:44.558 --> 21:45.706
I got a pump number.

22:01.023 --> 22:04.025
The security guard is stonewalling us
on the contraband reports.

22:04.026 --> 22:05.409
All right.

22:05.410 --> 22:06.889
Well, I got something.

22:06.890 --> 22:07.836
Danny's PDA?

22:07.837 --> 22:12.509
No. I went to the main server, and I
accessed a 1/2 dozen e-mails from last
night that he hadn't read.

22:12.510 --> 22:14.346
Some of them sounded pretty desperate.

22:14.347 --> 22:16.318
Where are you?
It's getting late...

22:16.319 --> 22:18.875
I need it.
You gotta come through, DK.

22:18.876 --> 22:21.779
What was he supposed
to give these people?

22:21.779 --> 22:25.333
Thing is, only one of them
sounded physically threatening.

22:27.799 --> 22:29.177
Take a look who sent it.

22:34.724 --> 22:36.580
"You're a dead man"
is just an expression.

22:36.181 --> 22:38.730
No. Legally, it's a threat.

22:38.731 --> 22:41.013
You withheld information
this morning.

22:41.014 --> 22:42.925
What was Danny Kleiner supposed
to give you?

22:42.926 --> 22:47.164
All the men in my family went
to Princeton.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.165
If I don't do the same...

22:50.946 --> 22:51.973
Danny was helping me.

22:51.974 --> 22:53.214
How?

22:53.215 --> 22:57.837
By giving me
the Chemistry 202 midterm.

22:57.838 --> 22:59.672
To Ms. Mancini's course?

23:03.705 --> 23:05.084
I'll be in
the shower, Danny.

23:21.003 --> 23:22.933
He'd get advance copies of all the tests

23:22.934 --> 23:25.628
sell them to us.
50 bucks a student.

23:25.629 --> 23:30.123
He was supposed to drop off the mid-term
last night at the dorm at 8:30.

23:30.124 --> 23:33.582
But he didn't show up,
and that pissed you off.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.636
Hey, I was in the dorm playing
cards with my buddies.

23:35.637 --> 23:37.049
The whole night.

23:39.208 --> 23:40.461
You can check it out.

23:42.530 --> 23:46.434
Do you think the parents have any idea
that they are paying for their kids
to have sex with teachers...

23:46.434 --> 23:48.298
...and buy their grades?

23:48.299 --> 23:51.354
I don't know, but it makes me realize
what an angel I was.

23:51.355 --> 23:52.674
Duquesne.

23:55.157 --> 23:56.311
Thanks, Sam.

23:56.312 --> 23:57.312
What's up?

23:57.313 --> 23:59.729
They matched the sand from the golf
course at the Gillespie house.

23:59.730 --> 24:02.720
Oh, that's great, but Justin's dad is
never going to let us get near him.

24:02.721 --> 24:04.455
Hey, it's enough for a warrant
for Justin's clothing

24:04.456 --> 24:06.730
and even his father
can't argue that away.

25:13.580 --> 25:18.163
You know,I didn't find one grain
of sand in your clothing.

25:19.596 --> 25:21.173
You weren't at the golf course.

25:21.174 --> 25:22.827
Yeah, I told you that.

25:24.243 --> 25:27.514
Mark Twain said, "The best
of all lost arts is honesty."

25:27.515 --> 25:28.962
I looked it up.

25:28.963 --> 25:31.439
I bet you were the
only one who bothered.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.404
My father is a criminal
defense attorney, too.

25:36.639 --> 25:38.040
When I was about nine,

25:38.041 --> 25:43.823
my dad had this indigent client named Bruno,
and he used to come over to our house
and fix our porch.

25:43.824 --> 25:47.707
My dad wouldn't defend his own
brother without a retainer.

25:47.708 --> 25:50.813
Anyway, Bruno was
this giant guy,

25:50.814 --> 25:53.062
and he was covered
in tattoos, and...

25:53.063 --> 25:56.187
my mom had told me that he was
charged with hurting a woman,

25:56.188 --> 25:59.885
so whenever Bruno would come over,
she'd take me shopping.

25:59.886 --> 26:02.783
And I asked my dad one day

26:02.784 --> 26:05.247
if Bruno had done it,
and my dad said,

26:05.248 --> 26:07.865
"My job is to defend him."

26:08.976 --> 26:11.863
And after Bruno was acquitted,
I asked my dad again if he had done it

26:11.864 --> 26:15.672
and he said,
"My only job is to defend him."

26:17.392 --> 26:19.462
And after that,
I kind of understood.

26:21.600 --> 26:25.249
I think you overheard something at home
about the murder of Danny Kleiner.

26:32.127 --> 26:33.894
I don't want to get my dad
in trouble.

26:36.589 --> 26:40.391
Your father is obligated to maintain client
confidentiality, but you're not.

26:45.307 --> 26:47.676
I was studying in my dad's library.

26:47.677 --> 26:52.957
I heard a guy's voice say that the body was
on the 18th hole at Miami Palms.

26:55.495 --> 26:56.659
I felt sick.

26:56.660 --> 27:01.380
You know, somebody was just out there rotting
on the golf course, and nobody knew?

27:06.370 --> 27:08.794
So, you sent a flash mob
to me sure they would.

27:13.992 --> 27:15.569
Yeah.

27:15.570 --> 27:18.488
Did you recognize the voice?

27:19.956 --> 27:22.314
No. It was muffled
through the walls.

27:24.192 --> 27:25.771
It was definitely an older guy.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.091
Hey, Ryan.

27:33.092 --> 27:34.310
I thought you were in court today.

27:34.311 --> 27:36.862
Oh, M.E. tesmony spilled over
to this afternoon.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.012
I thought I'd use my lunch break
to catch up on some work.

27:39.013 --> 27:40.576
Some guy just dropped this off.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.686
Burns from Palmcrest Academy.

27:42.687 --> 27:45.408
A security guard.
Better late than never.

27:46.846 --> 27:49.360
No wonder he's been
dragging his heels.

27:49.361 --> 27:50.039
On what?

27:50.040 --> 27:51.671
It's a long story.
Have you seen Delko?

27:51.672 --> 27:52.986
Yeah, he's
right over...

27:52.987 --> 27:55.723
Hey. I got the security report.

27:55.724 --> 27:58.485
GHB was turned in to Headmaster
Brooks two weeks ago.

27:58.486 --> 27:59.281
Okay.

28:00.332 --> 28:02.405
The report doesn't say
what Brooks did with it.

28:02.406 --> 28:03.981
There was no follow-up
report given.

28:03.982 --> 28:06.628
I guess the security guys didn't
want to lose their jobs.

28:06.629 --> 28:08.501
Well, they won't have to.

28:08.502 --> 28:10.526
With this information,
we'll be able to get a warrant.

28:10.527 --> 28:11.724
Let's call a judge.

28:33.637 --> 28:34.799
Hello Baby.

28:41.914 --> 28:44.248
Did he also tell you that I
can save you some money, huh?

28:44.249 --> 28:45.922
Full tank, half price.

28:45.923 --> 28:48.456
What, the owner
giving away some free gas?

28:48.457 --> 28:50.534
No, baby, Fidel is.

28:50.535 --> 28:53.300
I'm offering you a
business proposition.

28:54.323 --> 28:56.713
Nah, I don't want to gas.

28:56.714 --> 28:58.093
It's half price.

28:59.523 --> 29:01.493
Your cash for my card.

29:01.494 --> 29:03.292
Here's my card.

29:03.293 --> 29:04.572
How about my card?

29:04.573 --> 29:05.573
Hey!

29:10.449 --> 29:11.739
In the bag.

29:11.740 --> 29:13.916
Wallet, too.

29:13.917 --> 29:14.517
The wallet?

29:14.518 --> 29:16.114
Wallet, too

29:19.760 --> 29:20.617
Nice.

29:20.618 --> 29:22.637
Did you take it off her body?

29:22.638 --> 29:24.673
Body? What body?

29:24.674 --> 29:25.707
What body?

29:25.708 --> 29:26.944
Wrist.

29:29.833 --> 29:34.378
Nothing on top...but that's quite
the laceration.

29:34.379 --> 29:36.211
Yeah, it's an old wound.

29:36.212 --> 29:36.844
It won't heal.

29:36.845 --> 29:38.969
Why, you got the name
of a good doctor?

29:38.970 --> 29:39.970
Where did you get the wallet?

29:41.347 --> 29:43.101
I don't know. I was walking,

29:43.102 --> 29:45.279
and a car drove by,
and window down

29:45.279 --> 29:47.438
and wallet out.
Calle Ocho lotto.

29:47.439 --> 29:49.130
Oh, you can do better than that.

29:49.131 --> 29:51.969
Listen, man, I finger him...

29:52.170 --> 29:54.623
You won't let on
I fingered him, okay?

29:54.624 --> 29:55.489
'Cause he's killer.

29:55.490 --> 29:56.603
Fidel...

29:56.604 --> 29:58.813
Okay

29:59.483 --> 30:00.525
Okay

30:00.526 --> 30:02.410
Donny Slater.

30:02.411 --> 30:03.512
Donny Slater?

30:03.513 --> 30:05.564
Meth freak.
He's a real animal.

30:05.565 --> 30:08.331
Here's what we're gonna do.
You're gonna help me find Donny

30:08.366 --> 30:10.903
before he finds you.

30:13.487 --> 30:15.145
Switching gears.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.598
It's all DNA to me.

30:16.599 --> 30:19.847
Swab every surface of the wallet
and the credit card, please.

30:19.848 --> 30:21.331
Good thinking.

30:22.806 --> 30:26.611
Epithelials tend to get caught
in these raised numbers.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.377
I'll page you.

30:50.783 --> 30:51.937
Hmm.

30:51.938 --> 30:54.675
So, uh, she do it
for you, officer?

30:54.676 --> 30:56.703
Is all this yours?

30:56.704 --> 30:58.761
I help out when I got the time.

30:58.762 --> 31:00.601
What else do you do?

31:03.569 --> 31:06.682
Does she seem familiar to you?

31:10.140 --> 31:11.140
Pretty

31:11.141 --> 31:13.146
Too skinny for my tastes.

31:13.147 --> 31:19.296
Somebody killed her last night
in the Golden Triangle.

31:19.297 --> 31:20.733
Hmm. That's too bad for her.

31:20.734 --> 31:25.333
Yes. I understand that you did some time
for selling meth in the Golden Triangle.

31:25.334 --> 31:27.320
Well, I'm flattered.
You been reading up on me.

31:27.321 --> 31:30.199
I also noticed that cut on your hand.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.810
Got into a fight last night.

31:33.811 --> 31:36.104
Someone tried to cage my ride in.

31:36.105 --> 31:39.104
Somebody rearranged
this lady's face.

31:40.145 --> 31:42.212
Hey, I don't like to hit women.

31:42.213 --> 31:45.207
That doesn't mean
you didn't do it, does it?

31:45.208 --> 31:47.009
I need your DNA.

31:54.227 --> 31:55.685
Nice job.

32:04.943 --> 32:07.796
The warrant is to search your
entire office, Mr. Brooks.

32:07.797 --> 32:08.809
What?

32:08.810 --> 32:13.485
We have a campus security report that says
GHB was found on the quad last month and
turned in to you.

32:13.486 --> 32:16.373
There was no follow up
report given to police.

32:16.374 --> 32:17.374
I meant to.

32:17.375 --> 32:19.542
It's, uh, it's in this cabinet.
Excuse me.

32:19.570 --> 32:23.814
Our warrant's also for all your clothing
and shoes at your residence.

32:23.815 --> 32:25.255
My residence?

32:25.256 --> 32:27.176
Officers are there now.

33:41.508 --> 33:42.454
Duquesne.

33:42.455 --> 33:45.961
Calleigh, you'll never
believe what I figured out.

33:45.962 --> 33:47.937
Oh, I just might.

33:51.680 --> 33:57.625
Composition of the GHB found in this office
matches the composition of the GHB
that killed Danny Kleiner.

33:57.626 --> 34:03.031
Mr. Brooks merely stored it in his office
as headmaster, he did not dose the victim.

34:03.032 --> 34:04.247
We know.

34:04.248 --> 34:05.645
We think his daughter did.

34:05.646 --> 34:06.941
What?

34:06.942 --> 34:11.208
Stephanie had access to your office,
to your locked cabinet, is that correct?

34:18.873 --> 34:20.754
- No, I have the only key.
- Phil

34:21.813 --> 34:25.219
By her own admission, Stephanie did not
attend the flash mob,

34:25.221 --> 34:28.329
but trace evidence on her clothing
indicates she was at the golf course.

34:32.435 --> 34:33.937
We need to fingerprint
your daughter.

34:33.938 --> 34:37.277
Well, you can't. She, she left for
a semester in Europe.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.117
You're making yourself an
accessory to murder, Mr. Brooks.

34:42.118 --> 34:43.784
She didn't kill anyone.

34:43.784 --> 34:45.806
She'll tell you that
when we can call her.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.538
Daddy, stop.

34:48.539 --> 34:51.255
I told you to stay
at your mother's.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.520
I don't want to lie.

34:52.521 --> 34:54.322
I don't want to cheat,
that was the whole point.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.330
I forbid you
to say another word.

34:56.331 --> 34:58.210
I'm 18, Dad.

34:58.211 --> 34:59.540
I can do what I want.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.686
Stephanie, as your lawyer,
I strongly advise against this.

35:02.687 --> 35:04.271
Mr. Gillespie, you're fired.

35:04.272 --> 35:07.502
Fine.
You're an adult.

35:07.503 --> 35:09.719
Call me when you need me.

35:11.971 --> 35:13.806
You don't know what it's
like at this school.

35:15.355 --> 35:17.140
The teachers are oblivious.

35:17.141 --> 35:20.035
Or they ignore the obvious.

35:20.036 --> 35:24.237
I have watched
so many students cheat

35:24.238 --> 35:26.403
and charm their way through
four years of school

35:26.404 --> 35:29.452
while people like me are
considered study geeks.

35:30.836 --> 35:34.629
I overheard Danny trying
to sell the chem exam.

35:34.630 --> 35:36.395
He was always hitting on me.

35:36.396 --> 35:39.290
He just wanted to bag
the headmaster's daughter.

35:39.291 --> 35:40.997
So I used it.

35:40.998 --> 35:42.006
Hey, Danny.

35:43.728 --> 35:45.075
You going to the
library, Stephanie?

35:45.076 --> 35:46.799
Thinking more
about a hook up.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.097
Tonight?

35:48.098 --> 35:49.332
The golf course?

35:49.333 --> 35:50.731
I can't.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.442
How 'bout tomorrow?

35:52.443 --> 35:55.121
I knew you were all talk.

35:55.860 --> 35:56.675
No, wait.

35:57.026 --> 35:58.432
Tonight.

35:58.433 --> 35:59.674
Eight o'clock?

36:03.614 --> 36:07.966
My dad told me that security
found GHB on the quad

36:07.967 --> 36:09.101
a couple of weeks ago.

36:10.162 --> 36:12.533
I knew where my dad kept
confiscated drugs.

36:17.162 --> 36:18.348
I just wanted to knock him out.

36:20.158 --> 36:21.889
So that he didn't
give out the exam.

36:38.017 --> 36:40.011
And then I realized
he wasn't breathing.

36:41.542 --> 36:42.574
He was dead.

36:45.304 --> 36:48.478
I shredded the exam and threw
the PDA in the ocean.

36:48.479 --> 36:50.210
And then you told your father.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.615
She tried to tell me about the cheating
before, I wouldn't listen.

36:54.616 --> 36:57.301
I was addicted to our rankings.

36:59.184 --> 37:01.977
Highest grade point of any prep
school in the state.

37:05.674 --> 37:09.150
I let you down.
I'm sorry.

37:09.151 --> 37:14.979
I just wanted a level
playing field for once.

37:26.643 --> 37:29.535
Stephanie, I just heard.
If I had any idea it was you,
I never...

37:29.570 --> 37:30.781
Yeah,
you would.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.357
That's why I always
liked you, Justin.

37:33.358 --> 37:35.202
You're honest.

37:49.428 --> 37:52.909
All the blood on the surface of those
cushions matches our victim.

37:52.910 --> 37:56.444
So, there's nothing probative,
but if you were to beat
somebody to death,

37:56.445 --> 37:58.103
there's a chance
you'd injure yourself, right?

38:01.153 --> 38:03.706
So somewhere, there might
be the killer's blood?

38:03.707 --> 38:04.737
In theory

38:04.738 --> 38:06.544
Hey, take a look at this.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.928
It's a blood swipe,
not a splatter.

38:08.929 --> 38:09.978
He flipped it, right?

38:09.979 --> 38:13.451
So the killer put his blood
on the side of a cushion.

38:17.565 --> 38:19.807
Let's get a swatch of this
to DNA, all right?

38:28.651 --> 38:29.348
You rang?

38:29.549 --> 38:31.702
The blood from the couch cushion
is not from the victim.

38:31.703 --> 38:33.435
It's definitely male.

38:33.936 --> 38:34.582
Okay.

38:34.583 --> 38:37.891
But it doesn't match your gear head,
Donny Slater.

38:37.892 --> 38:40.187
So could it be
the victim's brother?

38:39.988 --> 38:41.582
Just about to run a sample.

38:41.583 --> 38:42.583
Do that.

38:43.841 --> 38:46.010
Alexx, is this
Madonna Arias?

38:46.011 --> 38:47.858
No, she's next.
busy weekend.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.001
Where is she?

38:55.502 --> 38:56.536
What are you looking for?

38:56.537 --> 38:59.357
I'm looking for lacerations
for an admixture of blood.

38:59.358 --> 39:02.239
Well, I guess it's possible.
In theory.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.051
Theory is all I have, Alexx.

39:05.913 --> 39:08.489
Alexx, what is this?

39:08.490 --> 39:09.490
Right there.

39:19.575 --> 39:20.914
It's malleable.

39:20.915 --> 39:22.636
Malleable and porous.

39:22.637 --> 39:24.003
Otherwise known as leather.

39:24.004 --> 39:25.764
He was wearing gloves, Alexx.

39:30.113 --> 39:31.556
You find Donny?

39:31.557 --> 39:33.186
Actually, we did.

39:34.967 --> 39:36.852
You didn't dime
me out, right?

39:36.853 --> 39:40.595
Fidel, Donny is the least of
your problems right now.

39:42.444 --> 39:43.699
You're under arrest.

39:46.727 --> 39:49.102
For what?
For using a credit card?

39:49.103 --> 39:52.424
No. For murder.

39:53.985 --> 39:58.913
the DNA that I recovered from the credit card
matches the DNA from the couch,

39:58.914 --> 40:04.378
and in forensics terms,
that means you killed Madonna.

40:05.682 --> 40:07.847
Donny Slater killed Madonna.

40:07.848 --> 40:09.873
Let me see the cut
on your hand, please.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.759
You mentioned that you were
having trouble healing this cut.

40:15.760 --> 40:21.938
I believe it's because you were wearing
leather gloves when you beat her to death.

40:21.939 --> 40:23.643
No, no, please,. Fidel.

40:23.644 --> 40:25.026
I swear I'm
telling the truth.

40:25.027 --> 40:26.152
Please, Fidel...

40:26.153 --> 40:27.715
I swear I'm
telling the truth.

40:27.716 --> 40:29.076
You snagged it

40:32.926 --> 40:37.907
The pressure from the impact
opened up an old wound.

40:39.443 --> 40:43.070
So while you were trying
to figure out what to do with her body,

40:44.448 --> 40:48.316
your runner showed up with a delivery
for the Academy girls.

41:09.996 --> 41:14.571
It was at that point you made the mistake
of trying to clean up.

41:21.058 --> 41:23.841
But what you didn't realize was
how much you were bleeding.

41:26.143 --> 41:27.145
Right?

41:34.659 --> 41:36.831
This is what I get
for doing people a favor.

41:38.223 --> 41:39.337
A favor?

41:39.338 --> 41:41.967
I gave the girl some chalk,
said, "Go sell it".

41:41.968 --> 41:43.474
"Pay off what
you owe me."

41:43.475 --> 41:45.467
Come back with some excuses.

41:45.468 --> 41:49.554
Her brother threw it down
a toilet.

41:49.555 --> 41:53.602
It's like going to a teacher saying,
"The dog ate my homework."

41:54.337 --> 41:55.980
Please, Fidel.
He flushed it.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.353
I swear it.

42:00.535 --> 42:05.085
Fidel, I don't think that you are grasping
the gravity of the situation.

42:06.666 --> 42:10.171
25 years to life, my friend.

42:11.229 --> 42:14.789
She was telling you the truth.

42:18.304 --> 42:19.283
Take him.

42:26.573 --> 42:27.058
Raul.

42:27.059 --> 42:28.703
They said you caught a guy.

42:28.704 --> 42:30.166
That's true.

42:30.167 --> 42:31.533
We did.

42:32.909 --> 42:36.925
This man confessed to your
sister's murder, Raul.

42:36.926 --> 42:41.706
Did he say why?

42:47.455 --> 42:48.930
No, he didn't.

42:52.734 --> 42:54.734
Raul, I am sorry.
