WEBVTT

00:03.560 --> 00:06.160
Including your sister. So if you
love her and want to take her alive

00:06.280 --> 00:07.200
tell me where she is.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.920
I love you. I'm sorry!

00:09.040 --> 00:10.120
Daddy!

00:10.320 --> 00:11.636
Seven years!

00:12.237 --> 00:14.415
All it would have taken was one message

00:14.416 --> 00:16.392
just to put me out of my misery.

00:16.399 --> 00:18.400
No. I couldn't risk Ariel finding us.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.200
Celine, I've been a priest for 20 years.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.800
I've never broken my vows, and
I don't think you should, either.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.400
- I love you.
- This is bigger than us.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.680
Frankie!

00:30.800 --> 00:32.680
She's gone!

00:32.800 --> 00:35.000
Your brother.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.480 --> 00:48.120
See that? That's what's
gonna kill everyone.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.280
Any second now.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.840
Yep, it's Judgement Day.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.760
The actual Apocalypse.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.320
And where am I?

00:57.480 --> 01:00.560
In Slough. Or, rather, under Slough.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.000
One minute, now. One minute.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.640
These pictures coming
live to us from Hubble.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.640
We could be trapped here for months.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.520
Years, even.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.000
What do we do when we
run out of conversation?

01:14.120 --> 01:16.400
I'm hopeless at small talk.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.360
It's time to brace
ourselves to say goodbye.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.320
The world waits with bated breath.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.560
In a few short hours,

01:32.720 --> 01:36.280
we'll know whether Operation
Saviour has succeeded

01:36.400 --> 01:39.600
and whether Mankind has a future.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.720
I'm here outside Mission Control.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.760
The media aren't allowed in.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.560
But we understand the Saviour team
have been working through the night

02:05.720 --> 02:07.760
to make sure that everything goes to plan.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.440
The hopes of the entire human race

02:10.600 --> 02:13.120
rest on the shoulders
of these men and women.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.040
One can only imagine what's going
through their minds right now.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.040
These pictures are coming live
from the Saviour craft, sir.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.640
Well, not exactly live.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.560
There's a time delay because
of the distances involved.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.720
Of course.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.800
Could... could you explain to
me the exact sequence of events?

02:34.920 --> 02:36.280
Scotty?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.800
Yeah.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.320
Yeah, of course.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.880
Um...

02:41.040 --> 02:45.360
- OK, well, if we use this muffin as the comet.
- Right.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.880
- And this banana as the craft.
- Gotcha.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.200
Now, once our craft is
in the comet's orbit...

02:53.480 --> 02:55.320
... the craft...

02:55.440 --> 02:57.000
will split in two.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.680
And this bit, the leader,

02:59.840 --> 03:04.480
slams into the comet in
order to make a crater.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.040
And the follower, which
has the nukes in it,

03:09.160 --> 03:11.080
hits the crater a few seconds later

03:11.200 --> 03:12.720
and then...

03:14.800 --> 03:18.200
- It's kind of like a boxing combo, sir.
- One, two punch, right?

03:18.400 --> 03:21.161
We only need to knock the
comet off its current course

03:21.170 --> 03:23.760
by a couple of degrees
for it to miss Earth.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.840
When we first met,

03:27.741 --> 03:30.118
you said the chances of this
working were one in three.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.520
- Yes.
- Do you still think that?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.400
Well, we've done better than I hoped.

03:35.560 --> 03:40.360
And right now I'd say...
I'd say we're 50/50.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.880
Good work, soldier.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.560
Thank you, Mr President.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.761
_

03:49.880 --> 03:51.560
One moment!

03:53.760 --> 03:55.200
Just stay right here. Go.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.880
Yes?

03:59.680 --> 04:02.520
I thought I heard... voices.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.720
That's often the first sign of madness.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.200
To what do I owe this pleasant visit?

04:08.360 --> 04:11.720
The cardinals request your
presence at an urgent meeting

04:11.880 --> 04:14.400
to discuss the implications
of Operation Saviour.

04:15.960 --> 04:20.680
They would like a full status
report on all your would-be Messiahs.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.000
Alright.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.960
Where were we?

04:33.320 --> 04:34.400
What?

04:34.560 --> 04:38.600
- I don't want to have to hide in closets.
- I know.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.000
We both agreed that our work is
too important to walk away from it.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.200
We have to finish what we started.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.040
How long will that take?

04:48.400 --> 04:49.840
I wish I knew.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.320
I wish it didn't have
to be like this, but...

04:52.440 --> 04:54.040
I had a dream last night.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.160
Me and you in Florence,

04:56.280 --> 04:58.800
watching the sunset, holding hands.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.280
It sounds clichÃ©, I know.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.120
But it was wonderful.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.240
Just you and me.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.400
A man and a woman being ordinary people.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.280
And then I wake up.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.160
And before I know it, I'm in the closet.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.400
I've never been to Florence.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.760
I wish I could give that to you.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.240
But...

05:23.360 --> 05:25.240
we have to finish...

05:25.360 --> 05:26.960
I know.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.080
Every day for a week and you find nothing!

05:34.280 --> 05:37.162
So you can get off your
arses and find my daughter,

05:37.163 --> 05:38.163
- you muppet!
- Lovely!

05:38.280 --> 05:40.000
She's just stressed. Thank you, sir.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.040
Thanks, guys. See you tomorrow.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.080
How was that helping Frankie?

05:45.840 --> 05:47.320
We need them on side!

05:57.120 --> 05:59.360
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.440
No. I like it when you snap.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.520
I like it when you show some oomph.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.720
We need more oomph, cos no-one else is
gonna help us find our daughter, Jamie.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.360
You can forget the police!

06:09.480 --> 06:11.200
Let's not do anything hasty.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.880
Jamie, we could be dead in a week!

06:13.040 --> 06:15.440
If we're not gonna do hasty
things now, then when are we?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.600
All Frankie's got is us,
and we're failing her.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.360
Putting up posters and
doing Facebook appeals

06:21.520 --> 06:23.480
is getting us no closer
to finding your brother.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.440
OK. Well, what else can we do?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.840
I don't know.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.360
I only ran to keep Frankie safe,

06:34.520 --> 06:37.280
to keep her away from Ariel. And
it's made no difference, has it?

06:38.680 --> 06:40.320
He's got her anyway.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.360
I failed.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.760
What's that? What are you making?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.720
Eat your peas.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.480
I hate peas.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.000
And I hate you.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.480
Why don't you like my real dad?

07:10.520 --> 07:12.280
Why do you wear those gloves?

07:15.120 --> 07:18.200
- Why don't you like getting your hands dirty?
- Oh, my God, do you ever shut up?

07:29.360 --> 07:31.520
What do I have to do to make you stop?

07:31.640 --> 07:32.840
Sweets.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.520
I'm not giving you sweets.
They're bad for you.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.840
I'll wet myself.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.040
And you'll have to clean it up.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.560
And then I'll wet myself again.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.720
Fine! I'll get you sweets!

07:57.600 --> 08:00.000
Mum says Dave's feeling a bit better today.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.360
She's just given him a bed bath.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.840
Actually, that's weird.
Why is she texting me that?

08:05.960 --> 08:07.400
Jamie, look.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.440
Have you ever seen the Severn?

08:14.720 --> 08:17.120
How's that helping, Jamie?
How's that a helpful comment?

08:17.240 --> 08:19.520
No. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.640
That's Ariel's handwriting.

08:22.641 --> 08:23.941
_

08:50.960 --> 08:52.880
Good grief, there's poetry!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.600
What's he saying?

08:54.720 --> 08:56.240
It says he's still in love with me.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.800
And if I go back to him,
nothing happens to Frankie.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.640
And then it gets a bit porny.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.840
No, make that very porny.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.880
Then it says he's gonna call me
later and tell me where to go.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.800
Yes!

09:12.960 --> 09:14.800
- Why are you smiling?
- Don't you get it?

09:14.920 --> 09:17.040
We've got something he wants.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.320
Me!

09:19.440 --> 09:20.880
We've got leverage.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.320
Jamie, how would you feel
about taking me hostage?

09:32.840 --> 09:34.280
Celine?

09:34.440 --> 09:37.040
What are you doing? This
is Father Jude's room.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.360
Please tell me you haven't.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.280
Come with me, child. We must talk.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.640
Do you believe in hell?

09:47.800 --> 09:49.114
- Yes.
- Good.

09:49.115 --> 09:51.315
I know it is fashionable
to believe it is a metaphor,

09:51.600 --> 09:53.200
but it is not. It is real.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.880
A place of infinite misery and torment.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.520
The Final Judgement could
be just days away, Celine.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.320
You have picked a terrible moment
to break your vow of chastity.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.080
- At least go to Confession.
- I don't want to repent.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.520
I love him. How can love be bad?

10:14.640 --> 10:17.240
It isn't. But hypocrisy is.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.160
You must make a choice.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.680
God, Jude, the Sisterhood.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.120
You can have two, but only
two. It is that simple.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.720
If you wish to stay with
him, you must leave the order

10:28.840 --> 10:30.640
and he must leave the priesthood.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.520
And you can live as man
and wife in God's grace.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.280
He says he cannot. That we
must finish what we started.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.320
Then open your eyes, my
child. He does not love you.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.880
How could it be love if he
could put your soul in danger?

10:49.840 --> 10:51.840
You must make your choice today.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.480
I know your heart is good.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.800
But if you die in sin,

10:58.920 --> 11:01.560
then you will burn in hell

11:01.680 --> 11:03.080
for ever.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.040
And so will Jude.

11:12.392 --> 11:13.672
Jude!

11:14.432 --> 11:15.632
Jude!

11:16.672 --> 11:18.192
What is it?

11:18.312 --> 11:20.112
We need to talk.

11:21.312 --> 11:23.752
- I'm with the cardinals.
- Jude, now!

11:27.672 --> 11:29.592
What's going on? Why are you so upset?

11:29.752 --> 11:31.552
I want you to leave the priesthood today.

11:31.712 --> 11:36.512
OK. What's happening?
Where's this coming from?

11:36.672 --> 11:39.952
What we are doing is
wrong. And we both know it.

11:40.152 --> 11:43.712
You say you hate lies and
hypocrisy. We are the biggest liars.

11:43.872 --> 11:48.552
No more hiding in cupboards,
in closets. I want you, Jude.

11:50.112 --> 11:52.112
I want you, too, but it's not that simple.

11:52.232 --> 11:53.392
It is.

11:53.512 --> 11:55.112
Leave with me today.

11:55.272 --> 11:58.952
Let's live honestly. I want
you more than any of this.

11:59.072 --> 12:01.272
This is bigger than us. It is.

12:01.392 --> 12:03.512
And I'm not done.

12:03.672 --> 12:06.912
We were damned the
moment we slept together.

12:10.952 --> 12:13.312
I hear you. We'll talk later.

12:20.392 --> 12:22.272
Oh, hey!

12:22.392 --> 12:23.672
How are you?

12:24.672 --> 12:26.632
Oh, thanks, guys!

12:26.752 --> 12:28.392
Such sweeties.

12:28.512 --> 12:30.512
Shut up, McNeil.

12:32.872 --> 12:35.632
They crack me up! They're doing
this whole Abu Ghraib thing.

12:35.752 --> 12:37.192
It's hilarious!

12:37.312 --> 12:39.112
OK. Bye!

12:39.272 --> 12:41.112
We'll talk about all the shoe stuff later.

12:41.232 --> 12:42.872
Are you OK?

12:42.992 --> 12:44.632
You have to get me out of here.

12:44.752 --> 12:46.952
Why am I even on a military base?

12:47.112 --> 12:49.072
The President imposed a state of emergency.

12:49.272 --> 12:53.032
The judicial process has been suspended
in favour of military tribunals.

12:53.192 --> 12:56.552
- Your chances of getting a fair trial are zero.
- I have rights!

12:56.712 --> 12:58.792
No, Rhonda, you don't
have any rights whatsoever.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.312
The State will seek the
death penalty for you.

13:01.472 --> 13:03.592
And what's more, they'll probably get it.

13:08.192 --> 13:10.312
And? And? What's our strategy?

13:11.512 --> 13:13.032
Honestly?

13:13.152 --> 13:15.072
Prayer.

13:15.192 --> 13:17.472
Get down on your knees and pray.

13:17.632 --> 13:20.312
Pray that Saviour works.
Pray that the rockets hit.

13:20.512 --> 13:21.180
Pray that the comet misses.

13:21.181 --> 13:23.550
Pray that the state of
emergency gets lifted

13:23.552 --> 13:25.192
and you get a proper trial.

13:26.752 --> 13:28.192
Goodbye, Rhonda.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.272
This is insane! It makes
no sense whatsoever.

13:36.432 --> 13:40.752
He's never gonna believe that
I've snapped and taken you hostage!

13:40.872 --> 13:43.592
Jamie, I hate to break it to you,

13:43.752 --> 13:48.952
but you are absolutely 100
per cent the type to snap.

13:49.152 --> 13:52.512
Tightly wound, lower-middle
management with a disastrous love life.

13:52.672 --> 13:55.392
You've got potential shooting
spree written all over you.

13:56.872 --> 14:00.232
You can do this. Look at me. Look at me.

14:00.392 --> 14:03.752
You are the sweetest,
kindest man I have ever known,

14:03.872 --> 14:05.552
but that is no good to us now.

14:09.072 --> 14:11.992
Please, Jamie, for our daughter.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.112
I need you to be a dick. You can do it.

14:23.512 --> 14:24.952
Hawkwind?

14:26.312 --> 14:28.272
No. Jamie.

14:29.432 --> 14:30.751
You must be my brother.

14:30.752 --> 14:33.535
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to speak to Hawkwind.

14:33.712 --> 14:36.512
Well, I'm getting a little
bored of what you want.

14:36.632 --> 14:39.152
Let's talk about what I want.

14:39.272 --> 14:41.432
That's not how this works.

14:41.552 --> 14:42.872
It is now.

14:42.992 --> 14:46.192
You've taken my daughter hostage.

14:46.312 --> 14:49.232
So I've taken our wife hostage.

14:49.352 --> 14:51.032
You want Hawkwind back?

14:51.152 --> 14:53.472
Fine. Let's swap.

14:53.592 --> 14:54.792
No.

14:54.952 --> 14:57.232
Nice try, Jamie, but I don't believe you.

14:57.352 --> 14:58.792
You still love her.

14:58.952 --> 15:03.912
You think so? After
everything she put me through?

15:06.072 --> 15:10.352
I know all about that
game you played with me.

15:11.592 --> 15:13.832
I know Layla was just a fiction.

15:13.992 --> 15:18.792
And I know I wasted
years of my life on a lie.

15:20.272 --> 15:22.472
So, no.

15:23.792 --> 15:27.552
How could I love someone
who betrayed me like that?

15:29.192 --> 15:32.312
Who hurt me more than
anyone else, including you.

15:34.432 --> 15:36.312
Congratulations, Ariel.

15:37.112 --> 15:39.032
You broke me.

15:39.152 --> 15:41.632
So if you think for one second

15:41.792 --> 15:46.472
I'm the same Jamie I was,
you are sorely mistaken!

15:46.592 --> 15:49.832
Now we are doing things my way.

15:49.952 --> 15:52.592
First, I want to know Frankie's OK.

15:52.712 --> 15:54.432
So put her on.

15:54.552 --> 15:55.832
Now.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.432
It's your dad. Say something.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.032
Hi, Dad!

16:04.152 --> 16:06.232
Hey, Frankie, are you OK?

16:06.432 --> 16:09.066
Yeah. He's given me all the sweets I want.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.898
And I don't have to eat anything else.

16:11.712 --> 16:12.492
There. Happy?

16:12.493 --> 16:14.754
You can't just give her sweets, you dick!

16:14.755 --> 16:16.310
She needs her five a day!

16:16.312 --> 16:17.912
OK. My turn. Put Hawkwind on.

16:18.032 --> 16:20.192
Husband number one wants a word.

16:22.032 --> 16:23.432
Ariel?

16:23.552 --> 16:25.352
I'm so scared!

16:26.152 --> 16:27.752
He's cracked!

16:27.872 --> 16:29.512
You have to get me out of here.

16:29.632 --> 16:31.072
What's he done to you?

16:33.112 --> 16:34.472
He's got...

16:34.632 --> 16:38.992
he's got my foot in a food processor!

16:42.832 --> 16:45.392
Please. Please, Ariel, help me.

16:45.512 --> 16:47.152
Just do what he says.

16:47.312 --> 16:49.952
You heard her! Now, do as I say, or else!

16:50.152 --> 16:51.572
Jamie, what the fuck?!

16:51.573 --> 16:54.591
You do not put people's
feet in food processors!

16:54.599 --> 16:56.570
There's a line even in
these kind of situations

16:56.571 --> 16:57.471
- and you've...
- No!

16:57.512 --> 16:59.152
You don't get to lecture me.

16:59.272 --> 17:01.312
You're not running things. I am.

17:01.432 --> 17:04.031
And if you want to see her alive,

17:04.192 --> 17:08.031
you meet me a five o'clock in
the car park Mary left me in.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.551
You bring back-up, Layla dies.

17:10.712 --> 17:12.352
You've got three seconds to answer me.

17:13.152 --> 17:14.271
Three...

17:15.152 --> 17:16.551
Two...

17:17.472 --> 17:18.752
One!

17:22.311 --> 17:23.512
Yes.

17:27.392 --> 17:28.952
You did it!

17:29.072 --> 17:30.272
Yeah.

17:31.672 --> 17:33.592
But that was the easy bit.

17:36.832 --> 17:38.872
Claimant Paul of Swansea?

17:39.032 --> 17:42.832
No, I told you. He's just
a cheap stage psychic.

17:44.032 --> 17:48.472
Claimant Jane Doe of
Warsaw. The new Messiah?

17:49.992 --> 17:51.672
No. No, absolutely not.

17:51.872 --> 17:54.602
Is that the six-year-old
who rose from the dead?

17:54.603 --> 17:56.170
I thought she sounded promising.

17:56.312 --> 17:58.112
Well, she wasn't.

17:58.272 --> 18:02.112
She's just an ordinary little
girl. We should leave her be.

18:03.552 --> 18:05.712
What is going on here?

18:05.832 --> 18:07.512
And enough with the stolen glances.

18:07.672 --> 18:10.112
If you two want to screw, get a room!

18:10.232 --> 18:11.632
Jude! Language!

18:11.792 --> 18:14.232
What is going on here? I've
never seen these two before.

18:14.352 --> 18:16.512
And why are we meeting down here?

18:16.672 --> 18:20.512
Consider this an informal
steering committee

18:20.712 --> 18:25.952
to discuss the theological
implications of the current situation.

18:26.112 --> 18:30.832
We know the candidates are,
on the whole, unsatisfactory.

18:31.872 --> 18:34.414
But with our future
dependent on these Messiahs,

18:35.115 --> 18:37.945
we must have a contingency. Yes?

18:38.212 --> 18:39.952
A contingency?

18:47.592 --> 18:49.272
T-minus one minute.

18:49.392 --> 18:51.072
Roger. One minute and counting.

18:51.192 --> 18:52.952
Case status. Updates, please.

18:53.112 --> 18:56.072
- Guidance systems.
- Guidance systems, go.

18:56.192 --> 18:57.672
- Engineering.
- Engineering, go.

18:57.792 --> 18:59.552
- Comms.
- Comms are go.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.352
- Pyros.
- Pyros, go.

19:01.472 --> 19:03.792
- Detonators.
- Detonators, go.

19:05.272 --> 19:06.512
Thank you.

19:07.792 --> 19:09.592
All systems go.

19:09.712 --> 19:11.112
Good luck, everyone.

19:11.272 --> 19:15.512
If Saviour succeeds, we have no
problem. The world is not ending.

19:15.632 --> 19:18.152
It is not The Final Judgement.

19:18.272 --> 19:21.632
But if Saviour fails,

19:21.752 --> 19:24.472
the end really is nigh.

19:24.632 --> 19:29.992
Is it fair to send the faithful to
their graves, stripped of all hope?

19:30.152 --> 19:33.472
This is the dawn of a new American
century, General. I can feel it.

19:35.152 --> 19:37.592
This is about looking the
Chinese in the eye and saying,

19:37.712 --> 19:40.072
"We still run this shit!"

19:41.152 --> 19:42.872
Screw four more years.

19:43.032 --> 19:44.672
If this works, they'll put me on Rushmore.

19:44.832 --> 19:46.912
Do you mind, sir? We're
trying to work here.

19:48.712 --> 19:50.992
The people need hope.

19:51.112 --> 19:53.992
We promised them a Messiah.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.992
So we must give them one.

19:58.752 --> 20:03.112
Whether we believe in him
or not is inconsequential.

20:03.232 --> 20:04.832
T-minus ten.

20:04.952 --> 20:06.032
Nine.

20:06.152 --> 20:07.272
Eight.

20:07.392 --> 20:08.832
Seven.

20:08.952 --> 20:10.192
Six.

20:10.312 --> 20:11.272
Five.

20:11.392 --> 20:12.752
Four...

20:12.912 --> 20:16.192
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

20:16.312 --> 20:17.832
... Two.

20:17.952 --> 20:19.232
One.

20:20.632 --> 20:21.952
Fire!

20:22.792 --> 20:25.612
But I would say... I would
say 60/40, Mr President.

20:26.632 --> 20:27.912
Alright!

20:30.192 --> 20:33.192
You can use all of the
flowery language that you want,

20:33.352 --> 20:36.392
but a false Messiah is a false Messiah.

20:36.512 --> 20:38.072
And if you anoint one,

20:38.192 --> 20:39.592
you're the fucking anti-Christ!

20:39.792 --> 20:43.992
Father Jude, I object to both your
choice of language and your insinuation.

20:44.152 --> 20:47.232
Really? My choice of
language is the problem here?!

20:47.352 --> 20:49.192
I mean, what is going on?

20:49.312 --> 20:51.152
If the press found out about this...

20:51.312 --> 20:54.872
What is said between these
walls stays between these walls.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.872
Does the Pope know about this?

20:56.992 --> 20:58.712
Of course not!

21:00.192 --> 21:03.192
So am I really the only one amongst you

21:03.352 --> 21:05.272
with the balls to stand up for the truth?

21:10.312 --> 21:13.032
Why? Why on earth do you own a gun?!

21:13.192 --> 21:16.352
I'm a single mother
living on a boat, Jamie.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.072
You get it doesn't actually work, right?

21:19.232 --> 21:22.192
- It doesn't even work?
- It's for show, OK?

21:22.392 --> 21:25.114
It's a deterrent. All
you do is wave it around

21:25.115 --> 21:26.315
and make him think you're dangerous.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.992
I still think we should call Mum and Dave.

21:29.152 --> 21:31.312
The less moving parts this
plan's got, the better.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.577
All we've got to do is swap me for Frankie.

21:35.737 --> 21:38.297
And then when you've got her
safe, and I'm close enough,

21:38.417 --> 21:40.697
that is when I spray him.

21:42.377 --> 21:45.617
That?! That's what we're
pinning our hopes on?!

21:45.737 --> 21:47.497
He's gonna have a gun, Layla.

21:47.617 --> 21:49.217
No, I'm calling Mum.

21:52.897 --> 21:54.217
Aghh!

21:54.337 --> 21:56.417
Why did you do that?

21:56.617 --> 21:58.455
See? You're completely defenceless.

21:58.456 --> 22:01.225
This is when we'll be kicking
him in the balls. Very simple.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.377
Aghh!

22:02.497 --> 22:03.817
Oh!

22:03.937 --> 22:06.297
Oh, my eyes! I can't see!

22:06.417 --> 22:07.937
This is...

22:08.057 --> 22:09.377
genius!

22:09.497 --> 22:12.057
Ha! This could actually work!

22:12.177 --> 22:14.617
Yes. I told you. See? I told you.

22:14.737 --> 22:16.937
Yeah. Oh!

22:17.057 --> 22:19.177
Oh, we've planned!

22:19.337 --> 22:22.857
Has the blast succeeded in
knocking the comet off course?

22:23.077 --> 22:27.237
The Saviour team are checking and
double-checking their calculations

22:27.357 --> 22:28.997
- before making the announcement.
- _

22:29.157 --> 22:33.397
In the meantime, all we can do is wait.

22:34.317 --> 22:36.237
Wait and pray.

22:37.877 --> 22:41.277
We are all hypocrites, Jude.

22:41.437 --> 22:43.237
At least I have the decency to admit it.

22:43.997 --> 22:46.037
Please be practical.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.317
We need solutions.

22:48.437 --> 22:51.397
Not unbending fundamentalism!

22:51.517 --> 22:53.277
Fundamental?! I'm not a fu...

22:53.437 --> 22:55.357
How did I get on this side of the argument?

22:55.517 --> 22:58.717
You would have every
Catholic die without hope

22:58.837 --> 23:00.717
and for what?

23:04.997 --> 23:07.117
You have made your choice, Sister?

23:10.277 --> 23:12.997
My vows. I choose my vows.

23:13.247 --> 23:18.287
It's time to admit our faith has failed.

23:20.007 --> 23:22.367
Christ is not returning.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.727
No.

23:27.647 --> 23:29.807
You've given up on him.

23:31.127 --> 23:32.607
But I have not.

23:35.167 --> 23:36.647
Gentlemen.

23:36.767 --> 23:39.247
I move we put this to a vote.

23:41.007 --> 23:45.487
Who votes to anoint our
best current candidate?

23:47.327 --> 23:49.127
Your Eminence, please...

23:49.247 --> 23:51.607
Do not do this.

23:56.927 --> 24:01.727
I'm sorry, Father. I believe
we have a duty to the faithful.

24:01.847 --> 24:03.687
So...

24:04.967 --> 24:06.447
Are we done?

24:06.567 --> 24:08.927
Yes, I'm done.

24:13.367 --> 24:16.167
Father, come on. Enough of this.

24:16.287 --> 24:17.847
What are you doing?

24:17.967 --> 24:20.847
You're right. I'm a liar.

24:20.967 --> 24:23.087
And a hypocrite.

24:25.207 --> 24:27.167
I thought I was doing God's work, but...

24:29.847 --> 24:31.287
He's out there.

24:32.927 --> 24:34.607
He's not in here.

24:36.327 --> 24:38.287
And I was a fool to think that he was.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.167
I want to be a good man.

24:46.967 --> 24:50.246
Father, I must remind
you that this conversation

24:50.247 --> 24:52.247
is held in the strictest confidence.

24:56.567 --> 24:58.127
Go fuck yourself.

25:21.047 --> 25:24.527
Jamie, whatever happens, promise
me you'll get Frankie out of here.

25:26.287 --> 25:27.847
I'm not leaving you with my brother.

25:27.967 --> 25:29.887
Just promise, please.

25:33.207 --> 25:35.167
If anything happens to me...

25:36.727 --> 25:39.887
... her bedtime's half seven. She'll
tell you it's eight, but it's not.

25:40.007 --> 25:42.047
Except on Saturday.

25:42.277 --> 25:46.197
And she says she's not afraid of
the dark, but she is, really, so...

25:46.357 --> 25:49.197
always leave her door a little
open and a light on in the hall.

25:49.317 --> 25:50.957
You don't have to do this.

25:51.157 --> 25:52.451
And never leave her with
a whole pack of sweets,

25:52.452 --> 25:54.452
cos she scoffs the lot and then pukes!

25:54.957 --> 25:56.437
What else?

25:56.557 --> 25:59.677
Oh, the bloody giraffe outfit. OK.

25:59.797 --> 26:01.757
She won't let you wash it.

26:01.957 --> 26:05.677
But I've secretly got three of them, so
you have to sneak in while she's asleep

26:05.837 --> 26:08.397
and swap in a clean one,
otherwise she stinks.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.517
One other thing.

26:14.837 --> 26:16.917
She doesn't have a bedtime story.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.757
So she can't get to sleep unless you...

26:22.357 --> 26:24.197
We always watch your videos together.

26:26.517 --> 26:28.637
The ones for me you put on the internet.

26:30.117 --> 26:31.597
You watched them?

26:31.717 --> 26:33.197
Every night.

26:35.197 --> 26:37.237
And then when she was
asleep, I'd watch them again.

26:38.717 --> 26:40.237
Just for me.

26:46.397 --> 26:48.437
Make out I'm hostage!

27:19.797 --> 27:21.397
Stay there!

27:24.837 --> 27:26.397
Don't come any closer!

27:30.397 --> 27:31.877
Where's your gun?

27:31.997 --> 27:33.517
I haven't got one.

27:33.717 --> 27:35.457
I thought we were just swapping.

27:35.458 --> 27:38.190
I didn't realise the dress
code was "heavily armed".

27:40.077 --> 27:41.997
I must say I'm disappointed, Jamie.

27:42.157 --> 27:44.357
This is very ungentlemanly behaviour.

27:44.517 --> 27:47.957
Yeah. Well, look what you've reduced me to.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.197
You and your game.

27:50.317 --> 27:52.237
Ah, doofus!

27:52.357 --> 27:55.397
Years of pleasure, that gave me!

27:55.757 --> 27:59.117
It's funny. I always thought it
would end with you hanging yourself

27:59.237 --> 28:00.677
or stepping in front of a train.

28:00.797 --> 28:04.357
Never thought you'd go... psycho!

28:04.477 --> 28:06.437
Where's Frankie?

28:14.837 --> 28:20.117
Open your mouth. Make any sound.
You know what happens, right?

28:20.237 --> 28:21.677
Click, click.

28:28.357 --> 28:29.997
Out you come, poppet.

28:30.117 --> 28:31.717
Frankie!

28:31.837 --> 28:33.837
Here she is.

28:33.957 --> 28:35.997
- See?
- Hello, Frankie!

28:37.117 --> 28:39.797
OK. Send her over.

28:39.957 --> 28:42.237
Well, obviously that's
not gonna happen, Jamie.

28:42.397 --> 28:44.877
We're gonna send them across
at the same time, aren't we?

28:44.997 --> 28:46.237
On three.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.117
One...

28:49.197 --> 28:50.557
Two...

28:50.677 --> 28:52.277
Three.

29:00.557 --> 29:03.157
It's alright. Everything's alright.

29:20.957 --> 29:22.637
What is that?

29:22.797 --> 29:26.117
I figured you'd have some
half-arsed plan up your sleeve,

29:26.277 --> 29:28.597
so I thought it only
right to go tit-for-tat.

29:30.037 --> 29:32.237
Just keep in mind, whatever
it is you're planning,

29:32.397 --> 29:35.997
you do not want me to
let go of this button!

29:38.317 --> 29:40.077
It's in the giraffe.

29:47.877 --> 29:49.357
Uh-oh!

29:49.517 --> 29:52.237
Looks like you brought
a gun to a bomb fight!

29:52.357 --> 29:55.117
Schoolboy error, Jamie.

29:55.237 --> 29:57.477
Schoolboy error!

30:14.217 --> 30:15.937
Think this through.

30:16.057 --> 30:18.257
You shoot, I let go.

30:18.377 --> 30:20.337
Boom!!

30:20.457 --> 30:22.337
Drop the gun.

30:22.457 --> 30:24.057
That's it.

30:30.137 --> 30:33.337
And whatever else you've got
planned, don't even think about it.

30:33.497 --> 30:37.137
OK. Just tell me what
to do to keep her safe

30:37.257 --> 30:38.857
and I'll do it. Tell me.

30:39.017 --> 30:42.617
Whatever it is, whatever
it is, just tell me.

30:42.777 --> 30:44.999
- Put it on.
- Ariel, no!

30:45.000 --> 30:47.400
I'm only doing this because I love you.

30:47.617 --> 30:50.457
I just want us to be a
normal married couple.

30:50.617 --> 30:52.737
And that means losing the other husband!

30:54.217 --> 30:57.137
I'm not a bad man!

30:57.257 --> 30:58.377
You just...

30:59.257 --> 31:01.817
You make me do bad things!

31:11.017 --> 31:13.537
You look like such a bad end!

31:14.657 --> 31:16.297
Now, get on your knees!

31:16.417 --> 31:18.177
OK, Frankie.

31:20.737 --> 31:22.457
Go to your mum.

31:22.577 --> 31:24.897
Come on, Frankie.

31:25.057 --> 31:27.177
Come on, sweetheart. It's
OK. Come to me. Come on.

31:30.297 --> 31:32.537
- Uncle Ariel...
- I said, "Go to your mum!"

31:32.657 --> 31:34.217
I've eaten too many sweets.

31:35.697 --> 31:37.217
Don't you dare!

31:37.337 --> 31:39.497
Aghh!

31:42.017 --> 31:43.857
Jamie! Jamie!

31:45.577 --> 31:47.217
Run! Get out of here!

31:53.617 --> 31:56.897
- What the hell are you doing?
- Having a cuddle with my long-lost brother!

31:57.057 --> 32:00.177
We've had our differences, but
I'm sure we can iron them out!

32:00.857 --> 32:03.057
Go on! Let go of the button!

32:03.177 --> 32:04.537
I dare you!

32:07.657 --> 32:09.497
OK. OK.

32:09.657 --> 32:12.697
What exactly are we doing
here? What's your plan?

32:12.857 --> 32:15.337
- Sooner or later, you're gonna get tired.
- True.

32:15.497 --> 32:18.177
Then again, sooner or
later, I'm gonna wet myself

32:18.297 --> 32:20.537
and you hate mess, don't you?

32:20.697 --> 32:24.137
So how are you gonna cope with
my wee trickling down your leg?

32:30.017 --> 32:31.537
Nice try, Jamie!

32:32.697 --> 32:34.057
Nice try!

32:35.177 --> 32:40.137
But the doofus was never
gonna win at Doofus.

32:41.857 --> 32:43.457
Any last words?

32:45.337 --> 32:47.137
Go on, beg!

32:50.097 --> 32:51.577
Nothing?

32:52.777 --> 32:54.537
Kind of appropriate.

32:54.657 --> 32:57.417
Even your death is anti-climactic!

33:08.017 --> 33:09.577
Ariel!

33:27.217 --> 33:28.937
Dad, you were awesome!

33:29.057 --> 33:31.177
You can't be here. It's not safe.

33:32.537 --> 33:36.217
- It's OK. Uncle Ariel ran away.
- He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

33:38.657 --> 33:41.497
I helped, didn't I? With my sick.

33:41.617 --> 33:44.897
Yes. So no more sweets for you.

33:45.017 --> 33:46.457
Ever.

33:46.577 --> 33:48.337
Aw! Dad?

33:53.497 --> 33:56.977
Well, that's the end of
the giraffe outfit, then.

33:57.097 --> 33:59.257
Mum, I know you've got spares.

33:59.377 --> 34:00.537
What?

34:13.257 --> 34:15.297
What the hell's taking so long?

34:15.456 --> 34:18.377
I just asked them to
triple-check their calculations.

34:47.257 --> 34:49.016
Shanghai.

34:50.257 --> 34:52.617
Repeat. Shanghai.

34:53.337 --> 34:54.657
Well?

34:54.777 --> 34:56.417
Did it work?

34:58.577 --> 35:01.497
Mr President, I'm afraid
Operation Saviour has failed.

35:04.777 --> 35:06.737
We diverted it, but not enough.

35:06.857 --> 35:08.577
It's still going to hit Earth.

35:11.617 --> 35:14.897
Scotty, get him out of
here as soon as you can.

35:15.057 --> 35:17.257
Mr President. Mr President, this way.

35:17.377 --> 35:19.337
All external comms down.

35:21.177 --> 35:22.617
They've cut us off!

35:27.617 --> 35:29.217
Get back!

35:31.537 --> 35:33.857
OK. We're just getting
some breaking news here.

35:34.017 --> 35:36.137
And it's the news we've
all been hoping for.

35:36.297 --> 35:39.577
We have official confirmation
from Mission Control

35:39.737 --> 35:42.457
that Operation Saviour has succeeded.

35:44.257 --> 35:45.977
That's wrong! All wrong!

35:48.737 --> 35:52.017
For your own good, stand back!

35:56.777 --> 35:59.937
And a tweet here from Jacob Gardiner,

36:00.057 --> 36:01.897
one of the Saviour scientists.

36:02.857 --> 36:07.337
He just says, "We did it!
*You're welcome Earth."

36:07.497 --> 36:10.217
What the hell's that? I didn't tweet that!

36:10.337 --> 36:12.017
Who's doing this?

36:13.137 --> 36:16.737
You son of a bitch! You lied to me!

36:56.132 --> 36:57.812
Hello!

36:57.932 --> 37:00.252
Is Sister Celine here?

37:01.452 --> 37:04.012
No, no, no, no, Father.
Get out. You cannot be here.

37:04.132 --> 37:05.892
She has made her choice, Father.

37:06.012 --> 37:08.212
Is it always like this in here?

37:08.372 --> 37:10.532
Haven't you heard? The world is saved!

37:10.692 --> 37:12.852
- Yes. I will drink to that.
- We have a future!

37:13.012 --> 37:14.652
Which is why I need to speak with her.

37:14.812 --> 37:17.572
- Haven't you hurt her enough?
- Yes, I have.

37:17.732 --> 37:20.532
- That's why I'm here.
- No. Sorry, Father.

37:20.652 --> 37:22.572
Please. Give her this.

37:23.412 --> 37:25.092
Tell her I'm done.

37:25.252 --> 37:29.172
And now that there's a future,
I want to spend it with my wife.

37:29.292 --> 37:31.412
Yes. We were married.

37:31.572 --> 37:33.892
Isn't it amazing? And we
haven't had a honeymoon!

37:34.052 --> 37:38.452
We will go to Florence and we will
tourist the shit out of that place!

37:38.612 --> 37:42.452
You don't have to say "shit".
But try to convey my passion.

37:44.492 --> 37:46.492
Always wanted to visit a convent.

37:48.572 --> 37:50.492
This is exactly as I hoped it would be!

37:51.852 --> 37:53.292
Party on!

38:03.012 --> 38:05.212
A little more on my
forehead. It looks shiny.

38:06.572 --> 38:08.772
Seven salty sailors sailed the seven seas.

38:08.932 --> 38:11.532
Seven salty sailors sailed the seven seas.

38:11.692 --> 38:14.172
Seventy-seven salty sailors
sailed the seven seas.

38:14.332 --> 38:16.092
Are you comfortable with the speech, sir?

38:16.252 --> 38:18.492
Sure! I've done this a million times!

38:19.692 --> 38:21.572
Five, four...

38:25.332 --> 38:26.932
My fellow citizens,

38:27.132 --> 38:32.212
I am proud to be speaking to you from
Operation Saviour mission control.

38:34.292 --> 38:38.612
This is undoubtedly the most
historic speech I will ever make.

38:41.052 --> 38:44.092
Also the most pleasurable.

38:45.652 --> 38:47.772
Never before have we, as a collective,

38:47.932 --> 38:52.092
faced such a mighty challenge to
our existence and to our planet.

38:52.252 --> 38:55.972
It gives me great
pleasure, pride and honour

38:56.172 --> 39:03.372
to formally announce the unqualified
success of Operation Saviour.

39:03.492 --> 39:04.892
They hit it!

39:05.012 --> 39:06.252
Whoa!

39:08.612 --> 39:10.212
That was my brother!

39:10.332 --> 39:11.772
My brother did that!

39:21.892 --> 39:25.332
I would like to personally thank the
men and women of Operation Saviour

39:25.492 --> 39:28.412
who've worked tirelessly around the clock

39:28.532 --> 39:30.132
for the last 27 days.

39:31.612 --> 39:33.172
Now our future is assured,

39:33.332 --> 39:36.692
we must decide what kind
of future we wish to have.

39:38.252 --> 39:40.332
Will we revert to our old ways?

39:41.572 --> 39:45.332
Or will we seize this
chance to start afresh?

39:46.412 --> 39:49.252
Can we overcome the weight of our history,

39:49.412 --> 39:54.932
put aside our differences
and forge a new way of living?

39:55.972 --> 39:58.812
A more peaceful, harmonious life

39:58.932 --> 40:01.092
for the sake of our children?

40:01.252 --> 40:05.452
It is not often life gives
us a chance to start over.

40:05.572 --> 40:07.172
Let's not waste it.

40:09.612 --> 40:12.532
Let's remember how
united we feel right now.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.652
One planet.

40:16.772 --> 40:18.212
One race.

40:18.972 --> 40:21.172
The future is bright.

40:22.332 --> 40:25.332
The future is everyone's.

40:27.252 --> 40:28.852
Thank you.

40:30.852 --> 40:32.852
And we're clear.

40:37.372 --> 40:39.252
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

40:43.052 --> 40:44.372
Mr McNeil,

40:44.532 --> 40:46.372
we'll speak about everything tomorrow.

40:46.492 --> 40:47.732
Yes?

41:16.052 --> 41:18.132
I love you, Scotty!

41:18.812 --> 41:20.412
I love you!

41:20.532 --> 41:21.732
Woo-hoo!

42:23.652 --> 42:26.772
Rhonda McNeil, I find
you guilty of all charges.

42:26.932 --> 42:29.932
I sentence you to death by
hanging at midnight tonight.

42:30.092 --> 42:33.452
- He was having a breakdown.
- He committed suicide.

42:33.612 --> 42:36.732
- You lied to my son!
- Yeah. So did you.

42:38.332 --> 42:39.772
Kenneth?

42:41.452 --> 42:43.212
Don't!
