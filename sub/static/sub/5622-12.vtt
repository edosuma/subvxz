00:18.485 --> 00:19.551
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...

00:19.553 --> 00:21.487
Maybe you should both go
by your middle names.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.988
No, no, no, no, no.
Phil, what's your middle name?

00:22.990 --> 00:23.956
Tandy.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.657
Phil, what's your middle name?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.726
I don't have a middle name.
Can you believe that guy?!

00:27.728 --> 00:29.661
<i>He beats me up,</i>
<i>he tries to steal my wife</i>

00:29.663 --> 00:31.697
<i>while he's got a bun</i>
<i>in Erica's oven.</i>

00:31.699 --> 00:33.866
Hey, Tandy. You want
to go get a drink?

00:33.868 --> 00:35.067
I'd love to!

00:35.069 --> 00:37.336
I wish I was a lot more
like you.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.370
Todd, will you marry me?

00:38.372 --> 00:39.738
(Phil 2 groans)
Phil!

00:39.740 --> 00:40.873
Phil?
Oh, my God.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.007
GAIL:
<i>No, no, no,</i>

00:42.009 --> 00:43.042

TANDY:
Thank you, Todd, Gail,

01:03.064 --> 01:04.997
for that beautiful rendition

01:04.999 --> 01:08.534
of what I can only imagine was
one of Phil's favorite songs.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.436
Phil Miller got
knocked down,

01:10.438 --> 01:13.172
and this time,
he did not get up again.

01:14.874 --> 01:18.377
We raise a whiskey drink,
we raise a vodka drink.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.945
What a hero.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.381
That is why today,
we send him off

01:22.383 --> 01:25.751
the only way that truly
makes sense...

01:25.753 --> 01:27.886
a Viking funeral.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.555
ERICA:
Tandy, I told you,

01:29.557 --> 01:31.757
Phil wouldn't have wanted this.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.359
No, this is not
what he would've wanted,

01:34.361 --> 01:36.528
but this is what he deserves.

01:41.734 --> 01:44.203
I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you.

01:45.305 --> 01:46.305
(sighs)

01:46.307 --> 01:47.806
You did your best, Gail.

01:49.075 --> 01:51.143
Good-bye, Phil.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.712
We'll miss you.

01:58.918 --> 02:00.819
(crying)
I know.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.654
(accordion plays random notes)

02:04.657 --> 02:05.924
Okay.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.260
Buck up, bub.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.595
You can do it.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.296
And now I would
like to say

02:11.298 --> 02:13.532
my own personal good-bye
to Phil.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.239
(chuckles)

02:22.475 --> 02:23.742
(laughs)

02:27.780 --> 02:29.615
(sighs)

02:29.617 --> 02:31.683
And now we send him to the sea.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.955
♪ He belongs to the sea ♪

02:36.957 --> 02:40.659

02:43.130 --> 02:44.796
Tandy, you need

02:44.798 --> 02:46.865
No, I would like to do this,
Todd. I got this.

Honor.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.051
Burn, casket, burn!

03:06.053 --> 03:07.386
(groans)

03:08.621 --> 03:11.690
I honor you!

03:11.692 --> 03:12.824
Peace!

03:12.826 --> 03:14.193
Honor!

03:14.195 --> 03:15.894
Damn it!

03:15.896 --> 03:17.329
Hero.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.497
Honor and...

03:18.499 --> 03:20.632
Damn it!

03:21.834 --> 03:22.901
(stammers)

03:22.903 --> 03:25.170
And, according to ancient law,

03:25.172 --> 03:29.007
the requirements of the Viking
funeral have been met.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.375
Uh, Valhalla!

03:30.377 --> 03:32.377
Uh, honor, hero!

03:32.379 --> 03:35.080
Amen.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.082
(squeals)

03:44.023 --> 03:46.258
I still can't believe
I beefed the finale.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.760
I mean, Phil deserved
a bull's-eye.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.699
Hey, your speech
was a bull's-eye.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.602
Well, Carol,
the heart's aim is always true

03:56.604 --> 03:58.870
when it's dancing
like no one's watching.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.038
I mean,

04:00.040 --> 04:01.373
Phil was like a brother to me.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.574
I don't know about that.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.709
He was.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.510
I mean, sure,
we had some ups and downs,

04:05.512 --> 04:07.079
but we ended on a real high.

04:07.081 --> 04:10.282
You wouldn't understand
'cause you never had a brother.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.917
Okay, you didn't get a
chance to say good-bye

04:11.919 --> 04:13.085
to your own brother,

04:13.087 --> 04:15.287
so now you're projecting
this onto Phil.

04:15.289 --> 04:18.557
Okay, this has nothing to do
with my brother, okay?

04:18.559 --> 04:21.226
I mean, except for the fact
that Phil was like my brother,

04:21.228 --> 04:23.428
and I never got a chance
to say good-bye to him.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.230
It's just too bad,
because I think

04:25.232 --> 04:27.232
if his body had successfully
gone up in flames,

04:27.234 --> 04:29.134
it would've lifted
everyone's spirits.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.536
Well, you know what would've
raised everyone's spirits?

04:31.538 --> 04:34.072
Todd saying yes to
Melissa's proposal.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.641
(chuckles)
Well, you know Toddler.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.242
You know,
dude's a lifelong bachelor.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.310
(chuckles)

04:40.813 --> 04:42.948
I'm gonna go talk some
sense into that moron.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.950
Okay, but wait, Carol, Carol.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.418
There's something
I have to tell you.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.086
This is gonna be hard to hear.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.855
Then I'll move in closer.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.959
Todd and Gail are boning.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.261
(whispers):
Cheese and rice!

04:56.263 --> 04:57.663
Todd didn't do anything wrong.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.431
He and Melissa
had already broken up.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.099
I have to tell Melissa.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.101
Carol, you can't.
Todd swore me to secrecy.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.436
Well, Melissa's my best friend,

05:04.438 --> 05:05.971
and she is getting
boned against.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.606
And I'm your husband.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.741
Okay? So promise me
you won't say anything.

05:10.943 --> 05:13.412
Okay, I promise.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.847
Let me see those hands.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.020
Good catch.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.158
Hey, hon bun.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.359
Hey, bub.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.860
Aw, come on, Gail.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.796
I'm sorry about all that...

05:30.798 --> 05:32.497
buck up stuff at the funeral.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.133
I... I was just
a little freaked out

05:35.135 --> 05:36.935
'cause I think
Melissa noticed us.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.303
Well, so what?

05:38.305 --> 05:40.305
Isn't it about time
she found out anyway?

05:40.307 --> 05:42.140
Well, today's probably not
the best day, you know?

05:42.142 --> 05:43.475
And what is the best day

05:43.477 --> 05:45.644
to find out
that your ex-boyfriend's

05:45.646 --> 05:48.146
doing the devil's work
with the lady down the hall?

05:48.148 --> 05:49.314
Well, have you told Gordon

05:49.316 --> 05:51.116
about us yet?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.389
(chuckles)

05:57.391 --> 05:59.358
Oh, Todd,
I know you're probably right.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.194
Everybody's dealing with as much
as they can deal with right now.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.062
Just take all the time you need.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.497
Thank you, Gail.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.066
Well, I should probably
head out.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.037
(loudly):
Well, thanks again, Gail.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.239
I<i> will</i> start wearing more hats.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.341
See you later, bub.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.243
(whispers):
Good cover.

06:31.190 --> 06:32.424
Carol!

06:32.426 --> 06:34.226
Oh, hi!

06:34.228 --> 06:37.095
Sorry, I didn't
see you there!

06:37.097 --> 06:38.163
I'm breaking all your ornaments!

06:38.165 --> 06:39.164
Oh.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.198
(chuckles)

06:40.200 --> 06:41.733
'Kay.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.235
Yeah, I promise
I'll get you some more.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.870
I just needed to break
all these real quick.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.505
Yeah, I'd love
to talk, hon,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.006
but I'm just, I can't.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.207
You know the drill.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.208
What would I want to talk about?

06:50.210 --> 06:51.209
You know,

06:51.211 --> 06:53.011
Phil dying.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.013
The other thing.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.549
Todd's rejection of my proposal?

06:57.551 --> 06:58.717
Goldang it, Melissa!

06:58.719 --> 07:00.085
I said I can't talk right now,

07:00.087 --> 07:01.553
and I'd love for you
to honor that!

07:01.555 --> 07:04.089
(chuckles)
It's all good, Carol.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.257
Okay, talk soon.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.792
Yeah, hell yeah.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.196
TANDY:
<i>Phil and I had a bumpy ride,</i>

07:11.198 --> 07:14.366
uh, but I wouldn't change
a cottonpickin' thing

07:14.368 --> 07:16.535
'cause it led us
to our destination:

07:16.537 --> 07:17.702

Yeah.

to watch TV with me later?

Just as friends.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.084
Uh...

09:46.086 --> 09:47.218
I'm great,

09:47.220 --> 09:48.720
so it doesn't matter either way.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.555
Regardless of what you decide,
it's fine,

09:50.557 --> 09:53.224
'cause even if you have plans,
I'm doing great. (chuckles)

09:53.226 --> 09:54.593
Ah, I got no plans.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.062
I mean, come on,
what plans would I have?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.263
(both laugh)

09:58.265 --> 09:59.564
All right,
so it's a date, well, date...

09:59.566 --> 10:01.566
Not a date, an appointment.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.734
Great!

10:02.736 --> 10:04.769
You want this open or closed?

10:04.771 --> 10:05.737
Open.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.973
Okay.

10:07.975 --> 10:11.476
TANDY:<i> Ah, Phil, your room</i>
<i>seems so empty without you.</i>

10:11.478 --> 10:12.611
(sighs)

10:12.613 --> 10:15.413
I miss you so much, my brother.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.383
I just wish there was some way
that I could feel closer to you.

10:28.227 --> 10:31.596
I remember when I first met you.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.598
(in deep voice):
"Does this guy belong to you?"

10:33.600 --> 10:35.266
"Gas goes bad.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.602
Doesn't anybody remember
me telling you that?"

10:37.604 --> 10:40.005
"No, I just don't want you
to be president."

10:40.007 --> 10:42.674
"He poops in the ocean
in front of our house

10:42.676 --> 10:44.476
every damn day."

10:44.478 --> 10:46.077
"Tandy, go away."

10:46.979 --> 10:48.313
"It's appendicitis."

10:48.315 --> 10:49.681
(crying)

10:55.354 --> 10:59.124
"Tandy. Tandy.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.892
You want to go get a drink?"

11:03.295 --> 11:04.796
I'd like that, Phil.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.264
(chuckles)

11:15.808 --> 11:17.876
(inhales)

11:19.011 --> 11:20.712
(exhales)

11:22.548 --> 11:25.350
Nice hair, George Jefferson.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.654
Oh, if you were here right now,
I'd be busting your Cs so hard,

11:29.656 --> 11:32.157
"Philip Stacy Miller."

11:32.159 --> 11:35.360
Wait a minute.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.696
Stacy?

11:37.698 --> 11:40.131
(playing minor chords)

11:43.169 --> 11:45.236
Hey there, hon bun.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.738
Hey, sug.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.673
Would you mind
closing that door behind you

11:48.675 --> 11:50.575
'cause things are about
to get real physical.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.647
How you doing?

11:55.649 --> 11:57.682
Well, I'm feeling pretty guilty
about Phil's death,

11:57.684 --> 11:59.517
and for some reason
I can't explain,

11:59.519 --> 12:01.553
that is just making me
feel really horny,

12:01.555 --> 12:03.388
and then I feel like,
"Uh, I'm so wrong,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.356
I'm so bad,"
and that just amps up

12:05.358 --> 12:07.092
my horniness
and I just feel like

12:07.094 --> 12:10.195
the dog is just chasing
its tail on this one.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.397
It's just a vicious,
vicious cycle, so...

12:12.399 --> 12:13.865
get those pants off.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.034
Oh. Oh, man, yeah,
that sounds great.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.502
Man, yeah.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.070
I don't hear
any buttons popping, Todd.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.405
Well, you know,
here's the thing.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.906
It's just, I kind of...

12:21.908 --> 12:23.942
I kind of made plans
with Melissa.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.596
I see.
Yeah, so I'm just
gonna pop over there,

12:44.598 --> 12:46.297
you know, real quick,
show my face,

12:46.299 --> 12:47.732
and then I'm gonna
zip back here,

12:47.734 --> 12:49.234
get those pants off,
if that's okay.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.069
Okay, Todd.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.704
You just do you thing.

12:52.706 --> 12:55.406
Yeah, I-I'm gonna be right back.
Okay? So...

12:55.408 --> 12:57.108
(loudly):
And, uh, thank you

12:57.110 --> 12:59.644
for telling me
how stucco is made.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.613
I'll see you later, bub.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.615
(door closes)

13:03.617 --> 13:05.750
"Bub."

13:05.752 --> 13:08.086
TANDY:<i> Friggin' turkey actually</i>
<i>did have a middle name.</i>

13:08.088 --> 13:09.621
"Stacy."

13:09.623 --> 13:11.122
I mean, it's flat-out
a girl's name.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.423
No offense, Stacy.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.826
Oh, I miss you, bud.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.428
Miss you with all my heart.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.064
(sobbing)

13:22.134 --> 13:24.269
I know a man's
not supposed to cry,

13:24.271 --> 13:26.771
but most men don't get
a chance to experience

13:26.773 --> 13:28.773
the kind of friendship
that Phil and I had.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.475
Now it's over.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.011
He just left without a trace.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.581
Or did he?

13:40.986 --> 13:42.453
G'day.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.323
Look, Erica,

13:45.325 --> 13:46.958
I know you're scared

13:46.960 --> 13:49.494
and hurting
and full of worries right now.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.796
But I'm here to take one of
those worries off your plate

13:51.798 --> 13:52.864
and eat it raw.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.968
I will be the father
to your baby.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.370
That's a... a nice offer...

13:59.372 --> 14:01.472
Come on, it's what Phil and I
would have wanted,

14:01.474 --> 14:03.641
so please accept
our gift,

14:03.643 --> 14:05.310
this cradle, that Phil built

14:05.312 --> 14:06.978
and that I fixed.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.013
(chuckles)

14:09.015 --> 14:10.849
Knew I should've gone
with masking tape.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.051
Huh.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.385
Hey.

14:15.654 --> 14:17.822
Come here.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.325
Um...
(laughs)

14:20.327 --> 14:21.993
Can't believe we're doing this.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.696
(laughs)

14:24.698 --> 14:26.998
Yeah.
About that.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.834
The second-to-last thing

14:29.836 --> 14:34.005
that Phil said to me
before he died

14:34.007 --> 14:37.208
was, "Don't let Tandy
raise our baby."

14:37.210 --> 14:38.910
(scoffs)

14:38.912 --> 14:41.212
Well, you know,
hard to tell sarcasm

14:41.214 --> 14:44.415
when people are in extreme pain
like that, so, uh...

14:44.417 --> 14:47.919
What was the, uh,
the last thing he said?

14:47.921 --> 14:51.589
Well, the very last thing
he said

14:51.591 --> 14:54.425
was, "Did you hear me?

14:54.427 --> 14:56.127
I mean it."

14:58.530 --> 14:59.564
Okay, then.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.099
Mm.
(chuckles)

15:01.101 --> 15:03.401
As per Phil's wishes,
I will, uh,

15:03.403 --> 15:05.436
steer clear,
you know?

15:05.438 --> 15:07.038
(sniffs)

15:07.040 --> 15:08.539
Totally fine with this.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.408
I'm okay.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.710
All right.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.779
G'day.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.296
Friggin' two-faced turd.

15:32.564 --> 15:33.898
One minute, you're like, all,

15:33.900 --> 15:35.566
"Hey, uh, let's go get a drink."

15:35.568 --> 15:37.268
Then the next minute,
you go behind my back

15:37.270 --> 15:38.736
and you go tell Erica,

15:38.738 --> 15:40.905
"Oh, I don't want Tandy
to raise the baby."

15:40.907 --> 15:42.974
You know what?
You're no Viking!

15:42.976 --> 15:44.409
You're a sucking!

15:44.411 --> 15:46.911
Friggin' Stacy.

15:46.913 --> 15:49.213
God, I'm so glad that you're
out there floating unburned.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.582
That's my burn on you, huh?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.484
And I'm just getting started.

15:55.487 --> 15:58.456
And Jimmy Sharp is your 2019

15:58.458 --> 16:00.325
international
motocross champion!

16:00.327 --> 16:02.160
Thanks for hanging
out with me.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.262
(sighs)

16:04.264 --> 16:06.164
Yeah. Of course.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.333
Yeah.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.836
Still can't believe
Phil's gone.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.338
Yep, yep.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.006
Gone with the wind.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.343
(exhales shakily)

16:18.345 --> 16:20.278
I'm just so sick
of losing people.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.447
Yeah.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.282
(stammering):
Yeah, w-we should go

16:24.284 --> 16:27.018
look for some in days.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.255
It's just so hard
to let go.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.193
Yeah.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.868
Uh...

16:48.640 --> 16:51.709
Uh...

16:56.615 --> 16:57.715
(sighs)

16:57.717 --> 16:59.650
Look, I hate to
do this, Erica,

16:59.652 --> 17:01.352
but in the spirit
of closure,

17:01.354 --> 17:03.821
I thought I should make you
aware of something.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.356
Apparently, that guy
who told you

17:05.358 --> 17:07.358
not to let me near your baby...

17:08.394 --> 17:10.995
...well, he was a
massive porn-head.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.363
I mean, look at this!

17:12.365 --> 17:14.365
Just craved it
to a sick degree.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.667
Okay. Tandy...
And not only that,

17:16.669 --> 17:20.571
the guy was out of his mind
on drugs.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.407
Uppers, downers,
sidewinders.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.242
And don't even bother
looking at his...

17:24.244 --> 17:26.310
his slam poetry notebook.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.679
"White man always finds

17:28.681 --> 17:30.415
"black man guilty.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.051
"Rage! Hatin' on puppies,

17:33.053 --> 17:34.886
so hard..."
Tandy,

17:34.888 --> 17:37.055
I was in this room
three hours ago.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.890
So you saw all the skid marks
in his underwear.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.024
I mean, every pair.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.859
Such a dirty bottom.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.996
I'm sorry Phil didn't want you
to help with the baby.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.235
Carol...

17:51.237 --> 17:52.537
Carol!

17:52.539 --> 17:54.906
Oh! Hey.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.108
Todd and I kissed.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.110
Did you tell Gail?

17:59.112 --> 18:01.245
Why would I tell Gail?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.947
Oh. I just, um...

18:02.949 --> 18:04.949
thought you two were close,

18:04.951 --> 18:06.884
but now that I think of it,
you and I are closer,

18:06.886 --> 18:08.252
so, yeah, this is normal.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.121
Well, I think we might
get back together.

18:12.391 --> 18:15.193
I have diarrhea. Bye.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.270
Good-bye, Phil's crap!

18:26.272 --> 18:28.239
Good-bye,
Phil's driver's license!

18:28.241 --> 18:29.941
Good-bye, Phil's watch!

18:29.943 --> 18:32.577
Good-bye to anything
that's ever belonged to you,

18:32.579 --> 18:34.645
even your clothes!

18:36.582 --> 18:39.083
Friggin' pants
didn't fit me anyway, fatty!

18:39.085 --> 18:41.252
You're history, dude!

18:41.254 --> 18:43.154
It's like you never
even existed!

18:43.156 --> 18:46.157
Now there's not even
a single trace of you left!

18:47.493 --> 18:51.162
Except for your stupid,
washed up coffin!

18:52.297 --> 18:53.664
What?

18:56.768 --> 18:58.536
Oh, farts.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.342
Well, well, well.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.477
Look who came crawling back.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.146
And I'm glad you're here,

19:08.148 --> 19:10.448
'cause I got something
I want to get off my bare chest.

19:10.450 --> 19:15.119
I wouldn't raise your baby
with a ten-foot pole.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.288
Not even if that pole
was made of gold

19:17.290 --> 19:18.789
and I got to keep it.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.825
And this all
could've been avoided

19:20.827 --> 19:23.794
(crying): if you had just
let me raise your kid!

19:23.796 --> 19:25.530
Man, I thought we were friends!

19:25.532 --> 19:26.864
ERICA:
Tandy...

19:30.469 --> 19:32.336
You okay?

19:32.338 --> 19:34.005
Um, I'm fine.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.706
Are you okay?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.375
No.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.544
I still just can't wrap
my head around it.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.978
You know?
Yeah.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.514
But at a certain point,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.350
you got to let it go.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.152
We have this saying
in Australia.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.154
(chuckles):
I know, I know.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.857
(Australian accent):
"That's not a knife.
This is a knife."

19:52.859 --> 19:54.725
Right?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.694
I've never understood
that saying

19:56.696 --> 19:58.529
until this very moment.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.064
It's like...

20:00.066 --> 20:03.201
(Australian accent):
that's not a knife.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.570
You know?
That isn't a knife.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.905
(normal voice):
But this...

20:07.907 --> 20:09.240
and this...

20:10.509 --> 20:12.210
(Australian accent):
...this is a knife.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.178
Right?

20:14.180 --> 20:17.248
Yeah, something...
like that.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.624
I know what
you did, Todd.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.294
You broke my heart.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.130
You<i> broke</i> my<i> heart.</i>

20:36.768 --> 20:39.437
Your lips taste
like Chartres.

20:42.874 --> 20:46.244
This is how we should've
done it all along.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.212
Yeah.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.748
Thank God we got
a second chance.

Tandy...

20:56.888 --> 20:59.890
You're right.

Good-bye, friend.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.532
Good-bye, Phil.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.404

Okay.
