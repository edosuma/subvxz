00:13.471 --> 00:16.266
Once in a lifetime,
a politician comes along

00:16.349 --> 00:17.642
who's not a politician,

00:17.726 --> 00:20.812
who's a person
who cares about our community.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.398
And that man is here
with us today.

00:23.481 --> 00:30.655
Please welcome the next mayor
of Santa Monica, Jimmy Mayhew!

00:30.739 --> 00:32.824
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:32.907 --> 00:36.035
Thank you for that very nice
introduction, Susie.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.620
You know, you can sit here,

00:37.704 --> 00:40.373
but you can't go to Broadway
when I'm selling out

00:40.457 --> 00:42.250
show after show for ten weeks.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.711
We have
an obligation imbalance, okay?

00:44.794 --> 00:47.130
'Cause I don't do anything
to invite you to,

00:47.213 --> 00:49.048
but you do things
to invite me to.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.259
I offered you...
I offered you opera seats.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.594
You mean up there on the side,
looking down?

00:52.677 --> 00:54.637
-The Prince Charles?
-Exactly, Mussolini's view.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.306
The Mussolini view?
Yeah, those are good.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.224
No, I said, "Myoo-solini."
You said, "Muss-olini."

00:58.308 --> 01:00.477
No, it's not "Myoo-solini"
like "muesli."

01:00.560 --> 01:02.312
-It's not like a cereal.
-No, it's like-- I, I compare...

01:02.395 --> 01:04.856
I confuse it with Mucilex.
I take that for my coughs.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.775
Now, as a resident
of Santa Monica,

01:06.858 --> 01:08.651
I wanna give everyone
in Santa Monica

01:08.735 --> 01:11.029
the ability to achieve
higher education.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.239
You never call me.
You always pick the restaurants.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.158
What are you-- What are you--
Are we married? I don't--

01:15.241 --> 01:16.868
(SCOFFS) I don't understand.
Am I dating you?

01:16.951 --> 01:17.952
You hate people.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.079
-I do. So what? (LAUGHS)
-Your wardrobe sucks.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.790
My wardrobe? You're talking
about my wardrobe?

01:21.873 --> 01:23.458
-Yeah, put this wardrobe down.
-Look! Look at you.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.335
-I'm one of the best-dressed...
-You're the worst--

01:25.418 --> 01:27.170
-...comics that ever lived.
-...you're the worst-dressed
person I've ever seen.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.254
This? You're comparing this--

01:28.338 --> 01:30.256
I can't even look at you.
I get depressed.

01:30.340 --> 01:34.761
When are you gonna die?
(CHUCKLES) Will you just...

01:34.844 --> 01:36.846
-Will you, will you please die?
-Don't hex my-- Don't hex my--

01:36.930 --> 01:39.724
As you know, we have
an election coming up.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.935
And the incumbent,
Jay Reimenschneider,

01:42.018 --> 01:45.021
entered the office of mayor
with great aspirations,

01:45.104 --> 01:47.857
but he failed to deliver
for the people of Santa Monica.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.068
-I will not fail.
I have many goals...
-Hey.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.778
That's the guy who's in, uh,
my new show.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.781
Young Larry. He's playing me,
when I was in my 20s.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.242
(WHISPERING) Hey.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.245
-Hmm?
-Would you mind tapping him?

02:01.830 --> 02:03.289
-Would you tap him?
-No.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.459
-Excuse me, could you--
-What?

02:07.627 --> 02:09.045
Just tap him on the shoulder.
I wanna--

02:09.128 --> 02:10.880
I wanna get his attention
for a second.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.590
(WHISPERING) Maybe he does
not want to be tapped.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.217
-LARRY DAVID: Believe me,
he wants to be tapped.
-No.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.718
And if he knew that I was here,

02:15.802 --> 02:17.720
-trying to tap him
and unable to tap him...
-I am not gonna tap him!

02:17.804 --> 02:20.098
-...he'd be upset.
-I do not like being tapped,

02:20.181 --> 02:22.892
and I will not tap a stranger.
Could you two please be quiet?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.978
-Why don't you be quiet?
-IRMA KOSTROSKI: Hey.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.479
You two have been talking,
and talking,

02:26.563 --> 02:29.107
-and talking, and talking. Stop!
-Okay, you're the one talking.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.775
-I'm... You're talking.
-You're talking. You're talking.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.318
-No, you're talking.
-LARRY: You're talking.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.486
No, you're talking,
and you keep talking!

02:33.570 --> 02:35.196
Where'd you
get that dress anyway,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.282
at a substitute teacher
designer warehouse?

02:37.365 --> 02:40.368
Just-- just stop. You know,
you mid-level celebrities,

02:40.451 --> 02:42.912
you think you're so smart
with all your banter.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.455
-Just stop!
-Shh!

02:44.539 --> 02:46.499
They won't shut up.

-(BOTH MOUTHING)

02:51.337 --> 02:53.548
They are the foundation
of the house

02:53.631 --> 02:56.926
where the American dream lives.
And to me,

02:57.010 --> 02:58.845
-the American dream
means that every person...
-(LARRY GRUNTS)

02:58.928 --> 03:01.055
Don't tap me again.
If you touch me again--

03:01.139 --> 03:02.223
Don't worry, turn around.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.391
-Don't touch me again.
-I'm not touching you.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.643
-LARRY: Turn around!
-I wanna work for you.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.854
I need your vote.

soon to be young Larry.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.828
Soon to be young Larry, yeah.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.247
I am so excited
for the table read.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.166
-Table read tomorrow. Yeah.
-(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.293
And I got you...
Why don't you take a pin?

03:30.376 --> 03:31.961
Oh, no, no, I don't wear pins.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.672
No? But you might change
one person's mind,

03:34.756 --> 03:36.591
and how incredible
would that be, Larry?

03:36.674 --> 03:38.092
Let me ask you a question.
You see somebody

03:38.176 --> 03:40.595
in a hat that says,
"St. Petersburg, Florida,"

03:40.678 --> 03:42.096
do you wanna go there?

03:42.180 --> 03:43.640
-As artists...
-As what?

03:43.723 --> 03:45.892
...we have an obligation.
Let me tell you something.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.519
Non-pros, there's nothing
they love more

03:48.603 --> 03:50.438
than when actors tell them
what they think.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.981
Wow.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.692
What a mouthful.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.903
Well, but it's really great
running into you, you know?

03:56.986 --> 03:58.154
-LARRY: Yeah, good to see ya.
-All right.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.365
And if there's anything
I can tell you about myself,

04:00.448 --> 04:01.824
-feel free to ask.
-(ASA CHUCKLES)

04:01.908 --> 04:03.785
-I'm an open book.
-Well, okay.

that after ten pages

04:05.954 --> 04:07.956

your pin, by the way.

up later. (MUMBLES) Leave it.

-I thought you did well.
-ANGELA MAYHEW: Yes.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.675
But can I just say a word
to you, that's important to me?

-Can you believe that kid?
-Yeah.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.198
He's rejecting everything
I'm putting in front of him.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.158
He's the biggest mug here,
if you ask me.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.659
Well...

08:13.743 --> 08:15.369
maybe we need
to cut him some slack?

08:15.453 --> 08:18.456
I heard something. I don't know
if it's true or not,

08:18.539 --> 08:22.501
but somebody told me
that he was sexually abused...

08:22.585 --> 08:23.753
-Oh.
-...as a young actor

08:23.836 --> 08:26.714
when he was, like,
17 or something, so...

08:26.797 --> 08:27.673
Okay.

I know it's a pain in the ass.

I can tell you
where it'll end up.

Lilly Collins's manager,
you know, really...

08:59.914 --> 09:01.749
They were

he was gonna get

-to repeal the ordinance.

they can repeal the law.

that little Asa there,

because I didn't have

15:58.040 --> 15:59.208
-any sex at all.
-STAN: Same here.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.043
I couldn't fucking
pay a woman to touch me!

16:01.126 --> 16:02.878
All right.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.672
-And take the glasses.
-Yeah.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.799
And talk to him about
what glasses Larry would wear.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.927
-LARRY: Yeah, okay.
-Lucky little fucker.

16:11.595 --> 16:14.682
-Hey, Larry.
-Good to see you, Larry.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.559
Having some problems
picking out glasses?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.186
Yeah, it's a real...
it's a conundrum.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.813
-Yeah, I'll bet.
-Yeah. I mean-- Yeah.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.940
You know what, you're really
giving Stan a hard time.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.274
You're acting like
kind of an asshole, and...

16:24.358 --> 16:26.860
-Uh-huh.
-...there could be
a justification for it,

16:26.944 --> 16:28.737
because I know
how traumatized you were

16:28.821 --> 16:31.699
from that horrible incident
you had when you were 17

16:31.782 --> 16:34.660
-and sexually abused
by a beautiful, luscious...
-(ASA GRUMBLES)

16:34.743 --> 16:37.454
-...voluptuous
Italian movie star.
-You heard about that, huh?

16:37.538 --> 16:39.039
Oh, my God.
I can't even imagine...

16:39.123 --> 16:41.417
-how horrible that must've been.
-No, you can't. It was so hard.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.668
-Let me ask you a question.
-Yeah.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.086
-How did that work exactly?
-Yeah. Well...

16:44.169 --> 16:46.213
Did she-- did she get you
in a headlock or, uh...

16:46.296 --> 16:48.966
No, I mean, listen,
it was a mental... headlock.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.427
-All right, cut the shit. Okay?
-ASA: Yeah.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.387
-You were 17 years old.
-Uh-huh.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.931
If a cactus touched your penis,
you would've been thrilled

16:56.014 --> 16:58.100
-at that age. Okay?
-Wow! Wow. Wow.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.226
-Yeah.
-I see what-- Okay.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.978
What if you were
in high school, huh?

17:01.061 --> 17:02.396
-LARRY: Yeah.
-And you-- and you slept

17:02.479 --> 17:05.065
with an older, famous actress,
how would people treat you?

17:05.149 --> 17:07.401
They would've named
the high school after me.

What do you want, Larry?

I was wondering perhaps if...

17:35.387 --> 17:37.973
you might wanna get
a cup of coffee.

Good afternoon.
My name is Irma Kostroski,

and we are here
to get this man elected

17:57.701 --> 18:00.120

Loves fresh air.
He loves fresh air.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.085
He's gonna solve
the homeless problem.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.670
He's gonna make 'em homed.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.510
Where does he stand
on the issues?

18:14.593 --> 18:18.639
You can't say "Happy New Year"
after January 7th.

-I-- I don't think he--
-HOMEOWNER: I like that.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.351

a Happy New Year

during Black History Month.
And, uh, what else?

18:24.686 --> 18:29.149
No child under ten
allowed in restaurants.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.610
-Oh, now that's awesome.
-You love that? (SIGHS)

18:31.693 --> 18:33.821
He's very strong
on environmental issues.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.615
-Really? Like what?
-He respects wood.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.325
-I like that a lot.
-LARRY: Good.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.494
A pin for you.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.371

to put it on right now.

-Appreciate you guys.
-Oh, one more thing.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.096
-Yes?

18:59.179 --> 19:01.306
We're canvassing
for Jimmy Mayhew.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.560
You know, he's for fresh air.
He loves fresh air. (SNIFFS)

19:04.643 --> 19:06.395
He likes
to breathe in fresh air.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.896
-I like fresh air.
-And how about this?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.648
He wants to get rid
of the penny.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.276
I'm all for that. However,
I'm in the middle
of a book club meeting...

I know it's you!

-SUSIE: How are you?
-How are you?

19:24.538 --> 19:25.622
-SUSIE: Good. Nice to see you.
-You're in a book club?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.624
-Yes.
-Why is that so surprising?

19:27.708 --> 19:28.917
What do you think,
we don't read?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.127
What are you reading?

19:30.210 --> 19:31.920
-The Sound and the Fury.
-Faulkner.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.881
-You two are reading Faulkner?
-Yes, we are. What?

19:33.964 --> 19:36.884
-Oh, is that--
-Oh, you're the only
intellectual of the bunch?

19:36.967 --> 19:38.594
What, you got
the Cliff Notes, huh?

19:38.677 --> 19:39.636
What are you doing?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.804
-We're canvassing.
-We're canvassing

19:40.888 --> 19:42.973
-for Jimmy Mayhew.
-Yeah. Yeah.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.434
Didn't you tell me the other day
that you would never canvass?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.810
No, I wouldn't canvass with you

19:46.894 --> 19:48.770
because you turn people off,
and I didn't...

19:48.854 --> 19:50.147
I didn't want you to turn
people off.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.773
-She turns people off. Yeah.
-He's doing a good job.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.443
So you're going door to door
to strangers' homes?

19:54.526 --> 19:56.028
-Yes. Yes.
-CHERYL DAVID: That's weird,

19:56.111 --> 19:57.446
because you don't even
like people.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.865
Well, I hate people
individually,

19:59.948 --> 20:02.367
-but I love mankind.
-Oh, you do?

20:02.451 --> 20:04.661
He's very interested
in local politics.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.747
-He called me,
we share similar--
-I'm sorry.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.082
-IRMA: Yes?
-Did you say
that Larry called you

20:09.166 --> 20:10.667
and asked if he could volunteer?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.753
-Irma, we should--
we should really get going.
-Yes.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.796
-We got a lot of houses to...
-He had a terrific change,

20:14.880 --> 20:16.256
a cornerstone of our democracy.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.216
I know that you don't care
about people,

20:18.300 --> 20:20.302
and you don't give a shit
about politics.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.388
Well, you know,
maybe when I was married to you,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.098
you held me back from

20:25.182 --> 20:26.934
the person
I really wanted to be.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.227
What's on your...
your sweatshirt?

20:29.311 --> 20:30.979
A pin for Mayhew.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.816
You hate pins 'cause they make
holes in your sweater.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.276
Well, it's a thin pin.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.778
-Oh.
-Ah. A thin pin.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.613
-A thin pin.
-It's a thin pin.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.616
-Anyway, let's leave them
to... to, uh, to Faulkner.
-It's what you have to do.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.284
-Thank you.
-What's wrong with Faulkner?

20:44.368 --> 20:47.120
Oh, yeah, you have
a great interest in
turn-of-the-century Mississippi.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.455
-I do!
-LARRY: Yeah.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.915
Well, you enjoy your book.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.292
I don't need a club
to read a book, but...

20:52.376 --> 20:53.669

for your time.

We've a lot to do.

What are you doing?

-Your local politics.

is going on?
-Goodbye.

supposed to do? How long--

they are to find in the Valley?

-Welcome to puff paradise.
-What's going on?

22:03.447 --> 22:04.906
Everything I give him,
he just rejects.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.243
He rejected these because
he said they were too "'90s."

22:08.326 --> 22:10.537
And he's looking
for a '70s vibe.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.373

if there's anything...

22:19.171 --> 22:21.381
-Such an asshole.
-STAN: And it's
everything else.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.091
-The pens, the cups.
-He wants the cups...

22:23.175 --> 22:24.468
Yeah, he wants the cups
to be dolphin-friendly.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.927

-What the fuck does that
even mean, Larry?

-I don't know. I don't know.
-STAN: It's crazy!

22:27.346 --> 22:29.473
And if he flicks his fingers
at me one more time,

22:29.556 --> 22:31.933
I'm telling you now, man,
I'll shove those fingers

22:32.017 --> 22:34.603
so far up his arse,
they'll pop out of his mouth

22:34.686 --> 22:36.438
and he can use them
as a hand puppet.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.731
-Oh, boy.
-STAN: Ridiculous.

22:37.814 --> 22:41.026
So I have a backup, Larry.
Okay? Zero calories in these.

22:41.109 --> 22:43.070
He's gotta love these.
Look, they look like something

22:43.153 --> 22:44.696
from fucking Starsky and Hutch.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.865
Seventies written
all over that, Lar.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.826
He can't reject those.
If he turns these fuckers down,

-I will fucking strangle him!
-(BAG POPS)

22:55.540 --> 22:57.959
So, it turns out he did
this movie when he was 17,

22:58.043 --> 23:01.129
-and had sex in her trailer.
-He was 17?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.547
He claimed that he was abused,

23:02.631 --> 23:04.966
and got
a 400,000-dollar settlement,

23:05.050 --> 23:06.343
and now he's playing the victim!

23:06.426 --> 23:07.803
This was his luckiest day
of his life.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.721
-LARRY: The luckiest day
of his life!
-LEON: He's ungrateful.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.847
This little motherfucker

23:10.931 --> 23:13.308
got a piece of ass,
which is priceless.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.811
Then he got 400,000 dollars
on top of that shit?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.312
-Yeah.
-LEON: And the movie paid him.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.730
He got paid three fucking times,

23:18.814 --> 23:20.232
-and he still complains.
-Exactly. (LAUGHS)

23:20.315 --> 23:21.775
How old were you
when you first got laid?

23:21.858 --> 23:22.943
Fourteen years old.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.236
-Fourteen?
-So if you were
in the Boy Scouts,

23:24.319 --> 23:26.196

your, uh, intercourse badge.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.031
LEON: Fuck, yeah.
My first time tapping

23:28.115 --> 23:29.866
wasn't some
gorgeous-ass actress.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.452
It was this lady that made
donuts and shit, donut shop.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.579
You don't see me
coming back years later,

23:34.663 --> 23:37.290
asking for 400,000 dollars
in donuts.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.625
-(LAUGHS)
-LEON: I could've.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.836
Cream-filled, jelly.
All that shit.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.838
I tapped the lady
that made the holes,

23:42.921 --> 23:44.423
-you understand?
-(LAUGHS)

23:44.506 --> 23:46.925
Hi there. Good afternoon.
Uh, before I take your order,

23:47.008 --> 23:49.052
I wanna let you know that
we do have a special today.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.513
There's a fresh Maine lobster,
and there's only a few left.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.390
-JEFF: Oh!
-SERVER: Drawn butter, lemon.

23:53.473 --> 23:57.310
-I know who loves that.
-Yeah, sounds pretty, pretty,

23:57.394 --> 23:58.520
pretty good.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.313
I'll take one, and could you
go in and secure it for me,

24:00.397 --> 24:01.481
so they don't get taken?

24:01.565 --> 24:03.233
You got it. Absolutely.
I'll be right back.

24:03.316 --> 24:06.319
Dig this, after we eat lunch,
I'm gonna go vote for the mayor,

24:06.403 --> 24:08.488
so I don't have to wait
on all those lines after.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.031
Oh, yeah, that's not a bad idea.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.324
RICHARD LEWIS: Someone
wanna come with me?

24:11.408 --> 24:13.827
I can't. I got a golf lesson.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.829
Berman's widow
took my time yesterday,

24:15.912 --> 24:16.997
so I gotta do it today.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.124
What was I gonna do?
It's the widow, right?

24:19.207 --> 24:20.667
Mr. David, I am so sorry.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.627
I know you were interested
in the lobster special,

24:22.711 --> 24:24.337
but by the time I got back
to the kitchen,

24:24.421 --> 24:25.755
we only had one order left,

24:25.839 --> 24:29.092
so we decided to give it
to another diner.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.052
-What? Who?
-Um, Mrs. Berman.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.138
I don't know if you know,
she's a recent widow.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.473
-But we have a lot
of other delicious dishes--
-Wait a second.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.392
-We have a--
-LARRY: That woman?

24:37.475 --> 24:39.686
Uh, yes. Mrs. Berman,
there in the black.

24:39.769 --> 24:43.064
That's Ruth Berman!
She's not the widow.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.524
She's Berman's ex-wife.

24:44.608 --> 24:45.984
They've been divorced
for ten years.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.444
She's as much a widow
as I'm a widow.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.279
Yeah. She took
my golf lesson yesterday

24:49.362 --> 24:50.822
by claiming she's a widow,

24:50.906 --> 24:52.532
-and now she's got my lobster?
-Yeah.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.867
-RICHARD: Oh, boy...
-It-- it's not right.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.410
-Uh, sir--
-RICHARD: Oh, boy,
there he goes.

24:55.493 --> 24:56.661
He's off. This is good.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.121
DINER: Yeah, we thought
you wouldn't come. I'm so glad--

24:58.205 --> 24:59.748
-Ma'am?
-Larry!

24:59.831 --> 25:01.875
-How's the lobster?
-It's wonderful.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.251
-Oh!
-You really should try it
sometime.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.212
-So happy to hear that.
-RUTH BERMAN: Yeah.

25:05.295 --> 25:08.256
-And how are you doing, Ruth?
-Actually, not really well.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.966
-LARRY: Aw. Yeah.
-This experience of losing

25:10.050 --> 25:11.301
-the love of my life...
-Oh, yeah.

...has been the hardest thing
I've ever gone through.

-LARRY: It must be so awful.
-You have no idea.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.557
And yet you managed
to have a...

25:18.225 --> 25:19.684
golf lesson yesterday.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.728
Saul would've wanted me
to do that.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.980
-Oh, absolutely.
-He loved me, Larry.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.732
And I adored this man.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.067
-Oh, yeah.
-You have no idea.

You're not a widow, okay?

You're the ex-wife

25:40.455 --> 25:41.581
LARRY: Oh, she lost her husband?

25:41.665 --> 25:42.999
She lost her husband
when he caught her having

25:43.083 --> 25:44.292
an affair
with a tennis instructor.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.794
-Excuse me?

26:06.314 --> 26:08.400
Yeah. I had to move

-It's a thin pin. Yeah.
-Thin pin?

a nervous breakdown,

27:02.412 --> 27:04.205

30:50.723 --> 30:52.350
SUSIE: So true.
One vote makes a difference.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.726
-IRMA: One vote!
-SUSIE: This is why you...

30:53.810 --> 30:56.479
-LARRY: It's outrageous!
-How do you lose by one vote?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.147
ASA: (SHOUTING) I know!

31:00.149 --> 31:03.361
I know how we lost by one vote.

31:03.444 --> 31:07.532
Larry David thought
the line was too long,

31:07.615 --> 31:08.700
so he didn't vote.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.076
-(CROWD GASPING)
-You didn't vote?

31:10.159 --> 31:11.744
-Is that true, Larry?
-What?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.830
-SUSIE: You lazy shit!
-No, that's not true,
it's not true, it's not true.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.790
ASA: I watched the whole thing.

31:15.873 --> 31:17.959
I watched you walk away
from the line,

31:18.042 --> 31:20.878
and throw your voting pin
in the trash can.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.964
-(CROWD GASPS)
-ASA: Isn't that right, Larry?

31:23.047 --> 31:24.966
All right, all right, let me
explain what happened, okay?

31:25.049 --> 31:28.636
-One damn vote.
-No! Let me explain!
Let me explain!

31:28.720 --> 31:31.139
All the canvassing.
I don't believe it.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.099
I made a deal
with a Reimenschneider voter.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.851
You don't care
about Santa Monica.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.562
-You only care about yourself!
-No! I made a deal!

31:37.645 --> 31:39.647
The line was so long,
so we both decided to leave,

31:39.731 --> 31:42.650
because we would cancel
each other out,
so it didn't make a difference.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.236
-Bullshit! I call bullshit.
-Absolutely selfish.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.031
The family is lovely,
just lovely people.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.783
Fry him! Fry him! Get him!

31:50.867 --> 31:52.827
What's the difference who voted?

31:52.910 --> 31:55.538
He would've lost anyway.
It's not my fault.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.833
It was that fucking widow,
Ruth Berman!

31:58.916 --> 32:03.713
