00:01.084 --> 00:02.711
Previously on Fringe:

00:02.886 --> 00:04.649
Olivia Dunham. FBI.

00:04.821 --> 00:06.880
They're calling these events
the Pattern...

00:07.057 --> 00:11.118
...as if someone's experimenting,
only the whole world is a lab.

00:11.294 --> 00:12.921
Anybody you need you can have.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.257
- His name's Walter Bishop.
- My father.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.457
He worked out of Harvard.
He was part...

00:17.634 --> 00:22.833
...of a classified U.S. Army experimental
program. In an area called fringe science.

00:23.139 --> 00:25.835
You're telling me my father
was Dr. Frankenstein.

00:26.009 --> 00:29.103
So much happened here.
So much is about to.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.518
Captain Loeb, what's your 20?

00:37.721 --> 00:39.655
We're in tow, 200 meters out.

00:39.823 --> 00:43.122
- What's your ETA?
- We're in position. Standing by.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.127
- No activity, captain.
- Roger. Hold position. Charlie.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.662
In position. Standing by.

00:48.832 --> 00:50.993
- Delta.
- Standing by, captain. In position.

00:51.167 --> 00:52.657
Roger.

00:53.770 --> 00:56.933
Cutting engines. At south bank now.

00:57.107 --> 00:58.540
Go, go, go.

01:02.612 --> 01:07.640
- South bank quiet. Bravo, status?
- All quiet, sir.

01:08.017 --> 01:11.976
Wait, I think I hear something.

01:17.193 --> 01:19.525
We have tango in sight.

01:25.034 --> 01:27.332
All teams move out. Go, go, go.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.669
Stop the truck. Stay where you are.

01:34.844 --> 01:38.871
Out. Out. Get out.
Hands where I can see them.

01:45.355 --> 01:48.984
Panda bears?
I assume you checked inside them.

01:49.159 --> 01:52.560
They knew we were coming.
Somewhere they made a switch.

01:54.397 --> 01:57.389
Joseph Smith. Began
working for the shipping company...

01:57.567 --> 02:00.536
...a week before the container was
packed. He had access to the container.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.263
He's also got a science background.
Customs has him...

02:03.439 --> 02:07.000
...back and forth from Budapest
eight times in the past 12 months.

02:07.177 --> 02:12.205
- Are the local agents on the operation?
- Coscarelli and Scrimm. Page 47.

02:14.951 --> 02:18.114
Weight of the container
after pickup was 1306 pounds.

02:18.321 --> 02:22.223
The weight when it arrived in Germany
before shipping, 1299.

02:23.626 --> 02:26.117
That's 7 pounds.
What the hell weighs 7 pounds?

02:26.329 --> 02:28.126
Mitchell?

02:30.700 --> 02:33.430
- Let's get a medic in here.
- Is he okay?

02:37.473 --> 02:38.531
What'd you give him?

02:38.708 --> 02:41.199
One epi. Cardiac arrest.
I've never seen this.

02:41.377 --> 02:43.402
Pupils fixed one minute,
dilating the next.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.104
- How's the rhythm now?
- Asystole.

02:45.281 --> 02:47.579
Charge the paddles, we'll start at 200.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.082
- Phillip, what's happening?
- We don't know.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.244
Is he gonna be okay?
Is it a heart attack?

02:52.422 --> 02:54.982
The only thing for us to do is wait.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.822
Clear.

03:00.496 --> 03:02.487
- All right, again. Go to 300.
- V-fib.

03:02.665 --> 03:03.791
Clear.

03:04.067 --> 03:07.230
We gotta open him up,
pump the heart manually. Prep him.

03:10.473 --> 03:12.270
Scalpel.

03:14.677 --> 03:16.645
Saw.

03:20.683 --> 03:22.583
Retractor.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.394
- We've got something.
- His heart's beating.

03:37.033 --> 03:38.933
What is that?

03:40.803 --> 03:42.134
I don't know.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074

04:19.541 --> 04:21.737
It happened in my office
two hours ago.

04:21.945 --> 04:25.312
It wasn't a heart attack.
At least not in the traditional sense.

04:25.481 --> 04:26.812
They cordoned off the area.

04:26.983 --> 04:30.350
But ID's been here already,
said the thing isn't communicable.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.421
- The "thing"?
- We'll get to that.

04:33.589 --> 04:35.557
- Do you have any gum?
- No, Walter.

04:35.725 --> 04:36.885
- Mints?
- No, later.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.154
Agent Loeb returned from
an operation last week in Frankfurt.

04:40.330 --> 04:42.389
- Do you know him at all?
- No.

04:42.565 --> 04:47.195
He collapsed. Thought it was a seizure
at first except he appeared lucid, in pain.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.270
Didn't seem like a heart attack either.

04:49.472 --> 04:52.498
None of us knew what it was.
And none of us know now either.

04:52.675 --> 04:55.872
- How are his vital signs?
- Weakening.

04:56.579 --> 04:57.841
Dr. Bishop.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.081
What you're about to see...

05:01.284 --> 05:03.775
I don't know if you've seen anything
like it before.

05:03.987 --> 05:06.683
But I'm hoping you have.
I'm hoping you can help.

05:06.856 --> 05:09.586
The man lying in that room
is not just a colleague.

05:09.759 --> 05:13.786
- He's a friend.
- I see.

05:14.263 --> 05:16.231
Do you have any mints?

05:30.146 --> 05:34.606
- This is spectacular.
- Spectacular.

05:34.784 --> 05:37.480
I'm sure he'd be just thrilled
to hear your diagnosis.

05:37.653 --> 05:40.213
Do you know what that is?
Your work, old experiments.

05:40.390 --> 05:42.051
- Does that look...?
- Familiar? No.

05:42.225 --> 05:43.817
It couldn't be more aberrational.

05:44.027 --> 05:46.393
I'm simply admiring the design.

05:46.562 --> 05:49.258
It's at least partially organic.

05:49.432 --> 05:54.233
Most likely a hybrid result
of genetic manipulation.

05:54.404 --> 05:59.899
Symmetrical. Its central body mass...
If indeed it is an organism at all.

06:00.076 --> 06:05.912
- Is designed, it seems,
to envelop the entire human heart.

06:06.416 --> 06:12.980
Look, look. A series of tendrils.
A root system. Don't you see it?

06:13.156 --> 06:17.957
- How beautiful this is.
- Not so much, no.

06:18.127 --> 06:21.688
Can you help?
Do you think you can remove it?

06:21.864 --> 06:27.928
Oh, I'd be willing to try.
But not here. My breath is atrocious.

06:30.506 --> 06:32.997
I was deconstructing in my head...

06:33.176 --> 06:36.043
...the approach
to designing something like this.

06:36.212 --> 06:39.113
Two things occurred to me
on the journey from the hospital.

06:39.282 --> 06:45.312
One, we could be dealing with something
as simple as, uh, Giardia duodenalis.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.048
- As simple as that, really?
- Single-celled parasite...

06:48.224 --> 06:51.159
...lives in intestines of animals.
Common waterborne illness.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.885
Could we attach Mr?

06:53.096 --> 06:56.793
- Loeb.
- Loeb to the vitals machine, please.

06:56.966 --> 06:59.526
So you're saying
that that thing in his chest...

06:59.702 --> 07:02.967
Is a parasite? Yes. Yes, perhaps.

07:03.139 --> 07:05.539
But with an exceptional
means of attachment.

07:06.042 --> 07:09.876
Typically parasites use
whole-body insertion.

07:10.046 --> 07:12.913
This creature is
unlike anything I've seen before.

07:13.116 --> 07:16.574
So we won't be able to truly examine it
until it's removed.

07:16.752 --> 07:20.882
- Loeb's recent case files, as requested.
- Oh, thanks, Astrid.

07:21.057 --> 07:25.391
And his wife just arrived.
She asked to speak with you.

07:27.029 --> 07:30.157
- I'm gonna talk to her in the office.
- Okay, he's wired.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.392
- What was the other thing?
- Pardon?

07:32.568 --> 07:35.560
You said that two things occurred
to you. What's the other one?

07:35.738 --> 07:37.433
Oh, oh.

07:37.640 --> 07:42.373
I would still really like some gum
or some mints.

07:44.013 --> 07:46.174
Thank you, Peter.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.079
Mrs. Loeb.

07:52.922 --> 07:55.390
Olivia Dunham.
I'm with Homeland Security.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.551
Samantha. I'm hoping you can help me.
No one will tell me anything.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.960
Why was he transferred here?
Can you at least tell me that?

08:03.166 --> 08:05.464
I can tell you
that there's a doctor here...

08:05.668 --> 08:09.627
...who is uniquely qualified...

08:09.805 --> 08:12.672
...to save your husband's life.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.611
This was in his bag.

08:19.482 --> 08:23.384
Among the things he brought back
from Frankfurt.

08:27.490 --> 08:31.927
- I don't know if it'll help at all.
- It might.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.825
We'll check it out. Thank you.

08:38.634 --> 08:42.626
Can I see Mitchell, please?

08:45.608 --> 08:49.408
As soon as possible.
I promise you that.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.196
Uh-oh.

09:17.373 --> 09:19.170
- What's happening?
- It's killing him.

09:19.342 --> 09:21.367
Squeezing his heart. It's killing him.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.307
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna give him Cyclobenzaprine.

09:25.481 --> 09:29.178
If the parasite is constricting,
this might loosen its grip.

09:29.352 --> 09:33.482
It's a gamble, but I like the theory.
Look at this.

09:34.523 --> 09:37.720
Oh, this is good.

09:37.893 --> 09:39.952
Organism's tissue.

09:40.129 --> 09:44.793
- Where the hell are you going?
- DNA analysis should tell us much.

09:52.375 --> 09:57.813
Excellent work, son. You may
have found your true calling at last.

09:57.980 --> 10:02.542
- Working with me.
- I certainly hope not.

10:13.596 --> 10:15.826
Please tell me
you guys have some good news.

10:15.998 --> 10:18.432
I don't know if it's good news,
but it's something.

10:18.601 --> 10:20.364
This is fascinating.

10:21.237 --> 10:24.900
- What?
- We can assume that this, uh, growth...

10:25.074 --> 10:28.441
...this parasite is of human design, yes?
- Okay.

10:28.611 --> 10:31.739
I was looking for repetition.
The signature of the creator.

10:31.914 --> 10:36.442
A sign, a footprint that he or she
had been there before us.

10:36.619 --> 10:38.780
- I don't understand.
- Well, you're the same...

10:38.954 --> 10:42.515
...as the rest of humanity. What he's
trying to say is we found this.

10:42.692 --> 10:44.626
Ah. See, that.

10:44.827 --> 10:49.924
This pattern repeats
throughout the DNA sequence.

10:50.099 --> 10:52.727
It appears again and again.

10:52.902 --> 10:57.032
But it's too organized to be accidental,
too perfect to be natural.

10:57.206 --> 11:00.767
So you're saying that someone
put in this line of DNA on purpose.

11:00.976 --> 11:05.709
- Why?
- Mischief, arrogance. We don't know.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.449
Your friend thinks it might be a code.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.987
The other one.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.826
I studied cryptology
even before I joined the bureau.

11:18.994 --> 11:20.586
I was obsessed as a kid.

11:20.996 --> 11:23.988
Now, I keep assuming it can't be this,
that it's too simple...

11:24.166 --> 11:27.329
...to be plain text, but I think
it may just be the Caesar Shift.

11:27.503 --> 11:30.165
- What's that?
- It's a simple monoalphabetic cipher.

11:30.373 --> 11:31.397
Is it, now?

11:31.574 --> 11:35.010
It's what Julius Caesar used, apparently,
to send letters to his friends.

11:35.177 --> 11:38.738
You take one letter and replace it
with another, but in alphabetical order.

11:38.914 --> 11:41.906
There's a sequence of three letters
that appears repeatedly...

11:42.084 --> 11:48.023
...in the parasite's DNA.
It could be CIW or DJX...

11:48.657 --> 11:52.787
...or EKY.
- Or ZFT.

11:53.095 --> 11:55.689
Yeah, ZFT fits, what is that?

11:57.533 --> 11:59.797
I've been reviewing
John Scott's cases...

11:59.969 --> 12:02.494
...checking to see
if any of them were mishandled...

12:02.671 --> 12:05.162
...or seeing if any of the cases
were left unsolved.

12:05.341 --> 12:07.775
- And?
- And one of them that I remember...

12:07.943 --> 12:10.844
...was an operation tracking a group
working out of Budapest.

12:11.013 --> 12:13.675
The name on the file,
what was written was ZFT.

12:15.551 --> 12:19.612
That means something to you? What?

12:20.790 --> 12:26.524
A month ago, a man, a British national
named David Robert Jones...

12:26.695 --> 12:31.530
...was arrested in Frankfurt, Germany,
by Interpol in possession of state secrets.

12:32.067 --> 12:36.663
His background is indeed biotechnology,
notably genetic weaponry.

12:37.306 --> 12:41.140
A senior fellow at the Bremming Institute
for 12 years, then went off the grid.

12:41.310 --> 12:44.006
He'd show up now and then,
often in Eastern Europe.

12:44.180 --> 12:48.378
- So you think he's ZFT.
- I don't know. But Loeb did.

12:48.551 --> 12:51.816
It was one of the reasons he was
in Frankfurt. Investigating Jones.

12:51.987 --> 12:54.512
- Meaning that thing...
- May be retribution.

12:54.690 --> 12:58.217
So ZFT, what is it? Who are they?

12:59.462 --> 13:02.954
There is much you have not been
made aware of regarding the Pattern.

13:03.599 --> 13:06.762
Well, I'm here, I have time.

13:07.336 --> 13:09.702
Are you available?

13:18.280 --> 13:20.407
What we've learned so far
is the following.

13:20.583 --> 13:23.916
There are cells. We don't know
how many. Privately funded...

13:24.086 --> 13:27.214
...with presence in 83 recorded
countries. ZFT is among them.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.380
- Terrorists.
- Not in a conventional sense.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.857
They traffic not in drugs or weapons,
but in scientific progress.

13:33.028 --> 13:36.293
- Meaning what?
- Meaning what happened on Flight 627...

13:36.499 --> 13:38.797
...or what happened to Agent Loeb...

13:39.001 --> 13:41.526
...these may have been simply proof...

13:41.704 --> 13:45.970
...that a scientific theory,
an experiment, worked.

13:46.141 --> 13:50.305
So that thing we found in Loeb
could be one of those experiments.

13:50.513 --> 13:52.811
Do you think Jones
will tell us how to remove it?

13:53.015 --> 13:55.882
He might.
If we were allowed to see him.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.652
German authorities refused us access.

13:58.821 --> 14:01.415
- What?
- They're not giving the U.S. access.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.956
- And he's being kept in Frankfurt.
- Yeah.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.153
- I may be able to get in.
- You got superpowers...

14:07.329 --> 14:10.389
...you aren't telling me about?
- Maybe.

14:10.566 --> 14:14.559
- You're not really going to Germany.
- Yeah, I'm really going.

14:14.737 --> 14:17.069
Let me save you the trip.
You're not getting in.

14:17.239 --> 14:20.970
We don't know each other well enough
for you to say something like that to me.

14:21.143 --> 14:24.772
And I don't see any other option here.
Do you, sir?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.980
Loeb's your friend.

14:28.417 --> 14:30.749
And I promised his wife.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.787
- What's wrong?
- This may be...

14:42.965 --> 14:47.425
...something of an understatement,
but he is not doing well.

14:47.603 --> 14:49.468
Dehydrated.

14:59.882 --> 15:02.942
Walter, come here.

15:05.354 --> 15:07.618
What is that?

15:12.094 --> 15:13.994
That's the root.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.997
- Coming up from his arm.
- Into the IV, yes.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.000
This parasite
is spreading faster than I thought.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.071
- How long do you think he's got?
- A day, maybe.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.539
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:30.713 --> 15:32.738
So the good news is
I think we have a lead.

15:32.915 --> 15:35.179
Bad news is
I have to go to Germany to see him.

15:35.351 --> 15:39.048
I don't think that's the bad. He's
dying. I don't think we're gonna make it.

15:39.221 --> 15:42.418
We're gonna make it.
I'll call you when I land.

16:20.529 --> 16:23.896
- Look at you.
- Well, don't let the suit throw you.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.728
Wow, Lucas, I never thought
I'd see the day.

16:26.935 --> 16:29.563
It's more comfortable
than the military uniform.

16:32.474 --> 16:36.001
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry.

16:40.249 --> 16:44.151
- I'm not sure I can help you.
- You said you have contacts at the prison.

16:44.319 --> 16:46.651
I'm in the Bundestag,
I have contacts everywhere.

16:46.822 --> 16:50.223
You jumped on a plane so fast
I didn't have time to check anything out.

16:50.392 --> 16:53.486
- Well, what did you find?
- I know the warden.

16:53.662 --> 16:56.927
He wouldn't agree to anything.
He didn't want me to show up.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.226
So, what do we do?

17:00.269 --> 17:02.237
We show up.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.394
Tenacious as always.
What can I do for you, Lucas?

17:31.266 --> 17:35.293
- Olivia Dunham, this is Johan Lennox.
- Thank you for seeing us.

17:35.504 --> 17:38.701
- You want time with a prisoner?
- David Robert Jones.

17:39.208 --> 17:42.143
- This will be a problem.
- I'm sure we can work something out.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.869
I'm sorry.

17:57.025 --> 17:59.926
Your friend wants to be persuasive.

18:00.429 --> 18:03.227
Mr. Lennox, you have reasons
why you won't allow access...

18:03.398 --> 18:06.265
...to your prisoners.
But this is very important to me.

18:07.970 --> 18:12.134
I would be willing to sign anything.

18:24.153 --> 18:25.916
I like her.

18:26.088 --> 18:27.783
You have good taste.

18:29.558 --> 18:32.322
Even if I were to give the okay...

18:32.494 --> 18:35.622
...Mr. Jones talks to no one.

18:35.798 --> 18:39.290
Well, I have reason
to believe he will talk to me.

18:39.935 --> 18:42.699
If I write him a message,
will you give it to him?

18:50.879 --> 18:53.143
I don't expect miracles.

18:53.582 --> 18:56.107
I don't know if I expect anything.

18:56.285 --> 19:01.086
But I am grateful
for whatever you can do in this case.

19:02.457 --> 19:04.015
- Sorry?
- I was just saying...

19:04.193 --> 19:07.993
...I'm grateful for your work.
- You're most welcome.

19:10.499 --> 19:16.631
You know, I had a fruit cocktail once
in Atlantic City.

19:16.805 --> 19:22.038
Mind you,
I'm not the fruit-cocktail sort of guy.

19:26.114 --> 19:27.638
Excuse me.

19:32.721 --> 19:35.315
We need to discuss your father.

19:36.558 --> 19:38.219
- Is it the fruit-cocktail thing?
- Mm-hm.

19:38.393 --> 19:39.917
Yeah, he's been doing that recently.

19:40.128 --> 19:42.323
He's obsessed about certain foods.
It's weird.

19:42.497 --> 19:45.591
- We need him to focus.
- To focus? Mr. Broyles...

19:45.767 --> 19:49.601
...two-thirds of the time my father's
not even lucid. And in those rare...

19:49.771 --> 19:53.263
...unpredictable moments of clarity,
he rambles about food he missed...

19:53.442 --> 19:56.741
...while incarcerated
in a mental institution for two decades.

19:56.912 --> 20:00.848
To say that he's not focused
is to say that he's a biped.

20:01.016 --> 20:04.179
Which is to say, you're absolutely right,
he's not focused.

20:04.353 --> 20:07.049
And also, it's not
going to change any time too soon.

20:07.222 --> 20:09.952
I'm his son, not a puppeteer.
Don't have a remote control.

20:10.158 --> 20:13.924
No master switch I can flick and turn
him into the man I wish raised me...

20:14.096 --> 20:16.963
...or even somebody
I don't have to babysit every day.

20:22.871 --> 20:24.862
I've had that on my mind for a while.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.037
Apparently.

20:30.212 --> 20:32.578
- Broyles.
- It's Charlie Francis.

20:32.748 --> 20:36.582
I understand I'm not at clearance level,
but I have something for you.

20:36.752 --> 20:39.778
- What is it?
- A local connection to the ZFT.

20:40.289 --> 20:42.280
- Speak to me.
- We analyzed the document...

20:42.457 --> 20:44.220
...Loeb brought back from Frankfurt.

20:44.393 --> 20:47.794
We figured out each line
corresponds to an FBI case file.

20:47.963 --> 20:51.558
And an ID number for the agent
or agents assigned to it...

20:51.733 --> 20:54.964
...every one of them
originating from this field office.

20:55.137 --> 20:56.764
Another mole in this office?

20:57.105 --> 20:59.596
You think what?
John Scott, he was working with ZFT?

20:59.775 --> 21:01.504
Maybe, maybe not.

21:01.710 --> 21:04.679
Whoever did this
needed upper-level security clearance.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.575
Access to the FBI mainframe.

21:06.748 --> 21:08.340
- You said local connection.
- Yeah.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.645
One of the lines is a phone number
registered to a Joseph Smith.

21:11.820 --> 21:14.755
- And we have him tied...
- Yeah, I know Joseph Smith.

21:14.923 --> 21:17.653
Loeb was briefing me on him
when he collapsed.

21:17.826 --> 21:20.158
- You got an address?
- Hold on.

21:20.929 --> 21:26.959
- 4331 Broad Street, Saugus.
- 4331 Broad Street. I'll call you back.

21:27.936 --> 21:31.599
This is Broyles. I want a SWAT team
surrounding Joseph Smith.

21:31.773 --> 21:34.674
He's at 4331 Broad Street in Saugus.

21:34.843 --> 21:36.834
And I want this radio-silent.

21:43.285 --> 21:47.346
It's good to see you again.
Despite the strange circumstance.

21:49.257 --> 21:51.623
You don't have to wait with me.

21:52.327 --> 21:54.022
As you keep telling me.

21:55.364 --> 21:57.264
I want to.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.997
I like it here.

22:00.769 --> 22:02.327
Thank you.

22:11.213 --> 22:15.980
I'm surprised. He'll see you.
But not until tomorrow morning.

22:16.151 --> 22:19.985
This is not Jones' rule. Or mine.
This is the institution's.

22:20.155 --> 22:24.148
Long before I got here, there have been
strict regulations regarding visitors.

22:24.326 --> 22:29.821
Tomorrow morning, you'll have
14 minutes, not a second more.

22:30.365 --> 22:32.697
Mr. Jones wanted you to have this.

22:44.513 --> 22:45.912
- Hello?
- Peter, it's me.

22:46.081 --> 22:49.107
- I'm looking for Broyles. Is he there?
- No, he's on some raid.

22:49.317 --> 22:51.046
Jones has agreed to
meet me tomorrow.

22:51.219 --> 22:54.120
But only on the condition
that he first talks to a colleague.

22:54.322 --> 22:57.621
So we're looking for a guy
local to Boston. He's in Saugus.

22:57.826 --> 23:00.954
- He's in what?
- His name's Joseph Smith.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.721
At 4331 Broad Street.

23:04.032 --> 23:07.092
- How'd you know that?
- That's who Broyles is after right now.

23:07.269 --> 23:09.794
- What? How?
- I don't know.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.405
Peter, we need him alive.

23:17.245 --> 23:18.576
- Hey.
- Are you there?

23:18.747 --> 23:21.545
No. I'm on my way.
You get in touch with Broyles yet?

23:21.716 --> 23:25.413
No, they're still radio-silent. I'm gonna
call HQ. I'll call you back.

23:35.931 --> 23:38.798
I know they're radio-silent,
but get someone down there now.

23:38.967 --> 23:43.097
You need to get the message to them
they need to keep Joseph Smith alive.

23:44.606 --> 23:45.903
Goddamn it.

23:56.418 --> 23:57.851
- Hey.
- You must stay back.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.817
- I need to talk to Broyles.
- This is a police action.

24:00.989 --> 24:03.787
You're not authorized
to get any closer to the house.

24:05.961 --> 24:08.657
- Are you close?
- I'm here, but I can't get to the house.

24:08.830 --> 24:10.127
They're already inside.

24:10.298 --> 24:12.425
On the roof, on the roof. Freeze, FBI.

24:12.601 --> 24:15.263
- Oh, no.
- What? Peter.

24:15.437 --> 24:17.928
- Oh, God.
- Freeze, FBI.

24:18.106 --> 24:20.040
- Oh, no, no.
- Stop or we'll shoot.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.540
- Oh, no, no.
- Drop your weapon.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.679
No, no, no!

24:26.314 --> 24:27.906
Peter?

24:29.050 --> 24:30.847
Peter.

24:40.095 --> 24:42.256
Have Evidence Response
catalog and box...

24:42.430 --> 24:44.762
...every item down to the toilet paper.

24:44.933 --> 24:46.457
Bishop, what are you doing here?

24:46.668 --> 24:50.069
I just got off the phone with Olivia.
She's headed back to the airport.

24:50.238 --> 24:53.765
It turns out Mr. Jones would only help us
if he could talk to Mr. Smith.

24:53.942 --> 24:57.469
The same Mr. Smith
that your people just killed.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.280
- You're kidding me.
- The first serious thing I've said all day.

25:04.319 --> 25:06.446
- Hello.
- Peter. Hey, it's Astrid.

25:06.621 --> 25:10.318
Your father wanted to inform you there's
fluid accumulating in Loeb's lungs.

25:10.492 --> 25:13.484
- Tell him we need help quickly.
- He says we need help quickly.

25:13.695 --> 25:17.153
Insert this into his IV.
Let me talk to him.

25:17.332 --> 25:21.132
Hello. Peter, this is me,
your father. Walter Bishop.

25:21.303 --> 25:23.771
- Thank you, Walter, I know who you are.
- Excellent.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.407
We need to talk
to that man Smith right away.

25:26.575 --> 25:29.840
He may be our best chance
to save Agent Loeb's life.

25:30.011 --> 25:32.844
I know that, but he's dead.
He was shot. We're out of luck.

25:33.515 --> 25:36.951
Does he still have his head?
Is it still attached to his body?

25:37.118 --> 25:40.281
Only you would ask that question
seriously. Yes, he has a head.

25:40.455 --> 25:44.289
Splendid. Then perhaps in this case
death is simply an inconvenience.

25:44.459 --> 25:49.590
Bring him in. And hurry. Agent Loeb's
tissue is already deteriorating...

25:49.764 --> 25:52.665
...which makes it
exponentially messier.

25:54.002 --> 25:55.594
What?

26:05.447 --> 26:08.314
- So close.
- You never did lose well.

26:14.122 --> 26:16.147
What happened, Olivia?

26:16.891 --> 26:21.828
There is something
that has shifted in you.

26:22.264 --> 26:27.031
- Something's happened.
- Well, a lot's happened.

26:27.302 --> 26:29.770
You know, it's been a strange time.

26:35.143 --> 26:40.080
I wasn't going to say these words.
But here we are, so I'm gonna say them.

26:42.651 --> 26:46.553
I've become, and I'm not kidding,
a spectacular cook.

26:49.424 --> 26:51.016
Spend the night.

26:59.701 --> 27:03.432
- I can't, Lucas.
- Of course you can.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.344
Of course you can.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.782
- Dunham.
- Does Jones know about Smith?

27:23.958 --> 27:25.858
- What?
- Does David Jones know...

27:26.027 --> 27:28.928
...that Joseph Smith is dead?
- No, why?

27:29.097 --> 27:32.863
If you can still get in to see
him tomorrow, he may not have to.

27:33.234 --> 27:35.702
Oh, good.
Bring him down here, son, quickly.

27:35.870 --> 27:36.962
- Get me ice.
- You asked.

27:37.138 --> 27:39.038
- The halo head brace.
- It's over there.

27:39.207 --> 27:40.572
- Good.
- We got it from here.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.609
- Did I ask...?
- To put salt water in the trough? Yes.

27:43.778 --> 27:47.646
Ninety kilograms. Not a drop more.

27:50.618 --> 27:52.916
- He's been shot in the head.
- Is that a problem?

27:53.088 --> 27:56.956
Yes, that's a problem.
Of course it's a problem.

27:57.125 --> 28:00.822
A bullet in the head would normally
indicate significant brain trauma.

28:00.995 --> 28:04.226
It'd also indicate he's dead.
You didn't have a problem with that.

28:04.399 --> 28:05.991
This isn't like removing tonsils.

28:06.167 --> 28:08.260
I never had a conversation
with a dead guy.

28:08.436 --> 28:11.997
- Forgive me if I don't know the rules.
- Is this going to work or not?

28:13.775 --> 28:18.269
I'll need to alter the procedure.
And I'm not making any promises.

28:21.149 --> 28:24.141
- Eighty-six degrees, Dr. Bishop.
- Good. Almost there.

28:24.319 --> 28:27.846
Let me know
when it's exactly 84.5. Blue.

28:28.022 --> 28:31.458
The human brain
is like a computer. Green.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.753
It just needs electricity to function...

28:34.095 --> 28:36.791
...which the body
ceases to produce upon death.

28:37.465 --> 28:40.628
Which is why
we're keeping his body cold.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.828
To retard degeneration.

28:48.309 --> 28:51.540
It's astonishing
how this man's scalp resembles...

28:51.713 --> 28:54.841
Peter's bare bottom
when he was a baby.

28:55.016 --> 28:59.043
- How did you know that?
- You told us that already. Twice.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.278
Oh.

29:00.455 --> 29:03.788
- What did I say next?
- That we're gonna kick-start his brain.

29:03.958 --> 29:06.324
Ah, yes. Excellent.

29:06.494 --> 29:10.521
Conductive gel to prevent the electrical
current from setting him on fire.

29:10.698 --> 29:14.998
Spread it evenly
and don't forget his nipples.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.229
Oh, Peter.

29:22.043 --> 29:25.171
In '75, the FBI
asked me to use this procedure.

29:25.346 --> 29:27.906
Someone had been murdered.

29:28.082 --> 29:31.381
I don't... I don't recall his name.

29:32.053 --> 29:37.081
James, I believe. Or Jimmy.
They wanted to identify his assassin.

29:37.725 --> 29:39.317
Union leader, I think.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.726
- Jimmy Hoffa?
- Yes.

29:42.831 --> 29:47.859
Yeah. The trouble was he had
a shockingly low electro-sensitivity.

29:48.036 --> 29:52.063
When I turned on the machine,
it instantly fried his brain like an egg.

29:52.240 --> 29:55.767
Everyone has a unique tolerance
to electrical stimulation.

29:55.977 --> 29:59.879
Mine, for instance, is remarkably high.
Yours, Peter, unusually low.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.414
As for our friend here, we don't know.

30:02.584 --> 30:07.749
Too little current and it won't work,
too much and we will overcook his brain.

30:07.922 --> 30:10.447
- So I will have to...
- You used to do this to me.

30:10.625 --> 30:13.958
You'd attach wires to car batteries
and then you would shock me.

30:14.128 --> 30:18.360
- Yes, I was accumulating data.
- No, you were experimenting on me.

30:19.501 --> 30:21.526
Son, we're ready.

30:21.936 --> 30:27.101
First we must test
if this will register any brain activity.

30:27.275 --> 30:32.770
And this will indicate
if he's transmitting any thoughts to you.

30:32.947 --> 30:37.475
Since he's dead, Peter, you'll obviously
have to be his ears and mouth.

30:37.652 --> 30:40.246
Eventually we'll connect this
to your head.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.582
Okay, dear, we're ready. Turn it on.

30:42.757 --> 30:45.783
Try 200 microvolts.

30:56.404 --> 31:00.170
Oh, look, Peter, he's talking to you.

31:01.242 --> 31:03.107
Whoa!

31:03.745 --> 31:07.237
I suppose it's a good thing
it wasn't attached to your head.

31:09.050 --> 31:10.745
Ha-ha. I don't believe you.

31:11.686 --> 31:13.415
I'm not kidding, looked into it.

31:13.588 --> 31:15.556
- You have not.
- I have.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.264
- So...
- Mm?

31:23.431 --> 31:24.864
...who was he?

31:26.768 --> 31:31.865
Whoever it was who broke your heart.
Or am I misreading you?

31:38.079 --> 31:41.105
He was my partner from the bureau.

31:41.849 --> 31:45.376
And you of all people should know
I've always been a little inept at this.

31:45.587 --> 31:49.387
But he was straightforward, decisive...

31:50.158 --> 31:52.854
...charming. And it was wonderful.

31:54.395 --> 31:55.987
Except it was all a lie.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.964
And he betrayed me. Betrayed the job.

32:00.134 --> 32:02.125
Then he died.

32:03.237 --> 32:05.034
That's the end.

32:12.981 --> 32:14.380
That's the end for him.

32:17.151 --> 32:19.915
I've known this for years.

32:20.888 --> 32:25.882
I screwed up with you.

32:26.060 --> 32:30.622
- The timing wasn't right for either of us.
- Yes, it was. I know it was.

32:31.933 --> 32:37.428
But I was scared.
And that's the God's honest truth.

32:41.643 --> 32:45.545
I think about you so often.

32:45.713 --> 32:49.046
And I don't call.

32:49.217 --> 32:55.679
Because... Because I'm ashamed
of how I treated you.

33:02.030 --> 33:04.362
No, it was just...

33:23.751 --> 33:25.742
Lucas, I...

33:57.185 --> 34:02.885
- I have to... I have to get this.
- I hate whoever that is.

34:05.059 --> 34:07.050
- Hello.
- You're not gonna believe this.

34:07.228 --> 34:10.391
Because I'm not sure that I do,
but this might actually work.

34:10.565 --> 34:11.657
Walter figured it out?

34:11.833 --> 34:14.358
Well, there are limits.
Some issues and problems.

34:14.534 --> 34:17.868
But Walter seems to think we can get
the dead guy to answer questions.

34:18.039 --> 34:21.940
Then we're on. I'll call you from
the prison, 8 a.m. tomorrow, my time.

34:22.610 --> 34:24.601
You okay?

34:24.812 --> 34:28.578
I'm good. Thank you.

34:35.255 --> 34:38.554
I'm gonna go back to the hotel. Ha.

34:38.726 --> 34:42.958
Grateful to you,
to the incredible cooking...

34:43.130 --> 34:46.362
...and your sweet words.

35:01.149 --> 35:02.776
Do you hear anything?

35:02.950 --> 35:05.077
I think we gotta ask him
a question first.

35:05.253 --> 35:07.050
I see.

35:07.555 --> 35:09.420
Are we ready
to see how this is working?

35:10.091 --> 35:14.084
When I say go, you, Astro,
will ask Peter a question...

35:14.262 --> 35:17.993
...I will flip this switch, which will
stimulate our naked friend's brain...

35:18.166 --> 35:20.930
...and Peter, you will hear his response.
Any questions?

35:21.102 --> 35:24.265
- Yeah. What should I ask?
- Anything you like, it's only a dry run.

35:24.438 --> 35:28.670
And, son, I should apologize in advance.
I'm afraid this...

35:28.876 --> 35:32.642
- Well, I shouldn't frighten you.
- No, wouldn't want to do that.

35:33.748 --> 35:37.775
Three, two, one, go.

35:37.952 --> 35:39.977
What's your favorite flavor
of ice cream?

35:42.790 --> 35:46.453
- Anything?
- Did I hear anything? No.

35:49.397 --> 35:54.198
- Three, two, one, go.
- What's your favorite color?

35:56.470 --> 35:58.938
No, still nothing.
Just extreme discomfort.

36:00.341 --> 36:03.003
- Hello.
- They're taking me to see Jones now.

36:03.177 --> 36:05.475
- Olivia. They're taking her.
- We're not ready.

36:05.646 --> 36:07.876
- No. Tell her to stall.
- Did you hear that?

36:08.049 --> 36:12.042
I'll do what I can, but I've only got
14 minutes, starting now.

36:12.553 --> 36:14.680
Fourteen minutes.

36:30.504 --> 36:33.803
What a pleasure this is.

36:41.482 --> 36:45.714
We have your Mr. Smith in custody.
You will not speak with him directly.

36:45.887 --> 36:48.651
You will ask me one question
that you want answered.

36:48.823 --> 36:51.587
I will relay that question
to an agent in the States...

36:51.759 --> 36:55.889
...who will talk to Mr. Smith. I will then
relay Mr. Smith's response to you.

36:56.063 --> 37:00.056
Then you will tell me how to save
Agent Loeb. That is how it works.

37:02.403 --> 37:05.668
You're very serious.
Do you know that?

37:06.874 --> 37:09.570
Your friend's life hangs in the balance.
Is that it?

37:09.744 --> 37:14.772
And you want me to save him.
I gather as much from your note.

37:15.182 --> 37:17.275
Tell me something.

37:18.386 --> 37:22.880
Why not your freedom or extradition?

37:23.057 --> 37:25.924
You must realize
that you have leverage here.

37:26.093 --> 37:28.857
Yet all you want
is the answer to one question.

37:29.030 --> 37:32.090
You make two assumptions,
Ms. Dunham.

37:32.266 --> 37:34.029
Both incorrect.

37:34.201 --> 37:38.262
The first is that there is nothing
more valuable than my freedom.

37:39.140 --> 37:42.268
The second is that I am responsible...

37:42.443 --> 37:46.072
...for the infection of Agent Loeb.

37:50.217 --> 37:52.549
Hello, Gene.

37:56.791 --> 38:00.249
Shh. Not a word.
I think I know your problem.

38:00.428 --> 38:05.092
You think too much. It's a family curse.
Your own brain function...

38:05.266 --> 38:08.633
...is interfering with the process.
You need to be a passive receiver.

38:08.803 --> 38:12.432
This is a sedative.
It will numb your higher brain function.

38:12.606 --> 38:14.972
I've mixed it
with a euphoria inhibitor...

38:15.142 --> 38:19.010
...which will clear the high
from your system in a matter of minutes.

38:19.180 --> 38:22.980
If I tell you to, stick this in his chest
right here, beneath the breast bone.

38:23.150 --> 38:25.516
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that?
- Adrenaline.

38:25.686 --> 38:28.246
Why, Walter?
Are you planning on stopping my heart?

38:28.422 --> 38:29.912
Walter, what are you giving me?

38:30.091 --> 38:34.084
Nothing for you to worry about.
Perfectly harmless.

38:43.571 --> 38:47.132
- What is going on in here?
- Mitchell.

38:48.576 --> 38:52.842
If you're not responsible
for infecting Agent Loeb, who is?

38:53.581 --> 38:57.347
Perhaps the same people responsible
for bringing us together.

38:59.720 --> 39:05.090
What if someone wanted information
from the both of us?

39:06.293 --> 39:11.993
Do you see?
Perhaps they've orchestrated all of this.

39:12.166 --> 39:18.799
What if you and I, both of us,
at this very moment...

39:19.473 --> 39:21.407
...were being manipulated?

39:21.609 --> 39:25.306
By who?
And what would they want?

39:25.479 --> 39:29.347
You've not been doing this very long,
have you?

39:30.651 --> 39:34.587
There are very few things in life
that surprise me anymore, Ms. Dunham.

39:34.755 --> 39:38.521
And yet, I confess, I am confused.

39:40.428 --> 39:44.831
If it is so urgent
to save the life of your friend...

39:45.666 --> 39:48.999
...why haven't we gotten on with it?

39:49.170 --> 39:55.166
- Peter. Peter, can you hear me?
- This can't possibly be scientific.

39:55.342 --> 39:57.333
Peter, look at me.

40:00.381 --> 40:02.144
Daddy?

40:09.590 --> 40:11.558
I think we're ready.

40:16.597 --> 40:18.428
- Hello.
- Go, quick.

40:18.599 --> 40:21.397
Go ahead. Ask your question.

40:23.304 --> 40:26.296
Ask my friend Joe:

40:28.109 --> 40:31.044
"Where does the gentleman live?"

40:32.947 --> 40:38.715
Mr. Jones would like to know,
"Where does the gentleman live?"

40:40.254 --> 40:41.585
Three.

40:42.990 --> 40:46.391
- Mitchell. Oh, God, what is it?
- Parasite in his bloodstream...

40:46.560 --> 40:49.222
...choking his oxygen.
Asteroid, nitroglycerine. A vial.

40:49.396 --> 40:50.420
I don't understand.

40:50.598 --> 40:52.395
Could you give us
some room, please?

40:52.566 --> 40:53.828
I'll call you back.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.764
Come on, Sam, let them do their job.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.641
Is there a problem?

41:08.816 --> 41:13.116
My phone doesn't get the best reception
in prison isolation cells.

41:15.923 --> 41:19.017
You do have Mr. Smith, do you not?

41:19.226 --> 41:21.524
I'm curious...

41:21.729 --> 41:25.722
...why you think he would cooperate
with you after you had him arrested.

41:26.433 --> 41:31.461
Oh. The people I work with
are loyal to the end.

41:31.639 --> 41:34.107
Can you say the same?

41:41.015 --> 41:42.983
- Hello.
- Okay, we're trying again.

41:43.150 --> 41:46.176
- Three, two, one, go.
- Where does the gentleman live?

41:49.623 --> 41:52.353
- Do you hear anything?
- No, no.

41:52.526 --> 41:55.393
I'm going to have to
increase the voltage.

41:55.563 --> 42:00.159
I'm sorry, son. Three, two, one, go.

42:00.334 --> 42:02.461
Where does the gentleman live?

42:06.974 --> 42:10.341
Uh-uh. Nothing. No.

42:16.684 --> 42:18.675
Astrid, I need the answer now.

42:18.852 --> 42:20.376
Agent Dunham, it's not working.

42:27.661 --> 42:30.824
I need paper. Paper. Give me some
paper quick. I see something.

42:30.998 --> 42:35.867
- Wait, hold on.
- Untie my hand. Quickly.

42:45.512 --> 42:47.571
What is that?

42:50.751 --> 42:52.582
I have no idea.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.023
I need the answer now.

43:06.200 --> 43:08.134
Don't have it.
Don't think it's working.

43:08.302 --> 43:12.568
- Walter, what is this?
- How do I know? You saw it, not me.

43:16.710 --> 43:19.008
He seems rather irritated with you.

43:19.179 --> 43:23.240
- Astrid, please, I have no time.
- I know. You have to hold on. I'm sorry.

43:23.450 --> 43:27.250
Walter, what is it? Do you see it? It's
there, there's just something missing.

43:29.156 --> 43:32.421
Obviously horizontal lines.
There's literature on this.

43:32.593 --> 43:37.360
Misrepresentation of horizontal spacing,
unilateral brain damage.

43:39.166 --> 43:40.758
Astrid, please hurry.

43:40.968 --> 43:43.664
- I don't understand.
- It's conjecture. But the bullet...

43:43.837 --> 43:48.740
...may have destroyed that part of the
brain that helps process horizontal lines.

43:48.909 --> 43:51.844
We are going
to have to fill in the blanks.

44:00.521 --> 44:04.685
God. Astrid, I have no time. I need
the answer now. Astrid, please.

44:07.061 --> 44:08.688
- Little Hill.
- Little Hill.

44:08.862 --> 44:11.023
Little Hill.

44:14.101 --> 44:17.366
Three parts Mebendazole,
two parts thermophilic hydrolase.

44:17.538 --> 44:21.440
A syringe directly into the parasite.

44:21.608 --> 44:24.236
Astrid, write this down.

44:24.411 --> 44:27.244
Three parts Mebendazole,
two parts thermophilic hydrolase.

44:27.414 --> 44:30.508
A syringe directly into the parasite.

44:39.893 --> 44:45.092
Walter, look. The roots, they're dying.

44:46.834 --> 44:49.234
What does that mean?

44:49.403 --> 44:53.305
Is Mitchell gonna live?
Is he gonna be okay?

44:53.474 --> 44:57.501
Yes, my dear. I believe he will.

44:57.678 --> 45:00.545
Thank you, Dr. Bishop.

45:07.321 --> 45:10.085
Jones asked me a question
about loyalty.

45:10.257 --> 45:16.492
And something about the way he said it,
it felt like he knew something.

45:17.164 --> 45:18.825
Like what?

45:18.999 --> 45:22.196
Something about my partner
betraying the bureau.

45:22.369 --> 45:24.428
I don't know.

45:28.342 --> 45:33.803
You know, I have other means of
gathering information about Mr. Jones.

45:34.782 --> 45:37.148
If you'd like me to use them.

45:40.521 --> 45:42.614
Say yes, Olivia.

45:42.790 --> 45:44.883
It'll give me an excuse
to call you again.

45:54.134 --> 45:58.730
Mitchell, I understand
that you're feeling far from 100 percent.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.700
But while you were unconscious,
we made a discovery.

46:02.876 --> 46:05.310
An organization
with connections to the Pattern...

46:05.479 --> 46:09.381
...may have someone working with us
on the inside.

46:09.550 --> 46:12.144
- John Scott?
- That was our first thought.

46:12.319 --> 46:15.720
But he would have needed higher
clearance than Scott was afforded.

46:15.889 --> 46:17.982
We thought that perhaps
you were targeted...

46:18.158 --> 46:20.854
...because you might have discovered
who that person was.

46:24.765 --> 46:28.166
Scott's the only one I know of.

46:32.172 --> 46:34.834
You're making me paranoid.

46:35.843 --> 46:38.505
All I wanna do is make you better.

46:39.079 --> 46:41.172
I'll see you in the morning.

46:41.648 --> 46:43.445
All right.

46:44.885 --> 46:46.546
Hey, Sam.

46:49.256 --> 46:52.089
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

46:52.259 --> 46:53.954
Sir.

46:55.529 --> 46:57.793
- How is he?
- He's good.

46:58.398 --> 47:01.561
The doctor here removed that thing
from his chest.

47:01.735 --> 47:05.432
- Walter made sure he saved it for him.
- I bet he did.

47:05.606 --> 47:07.938
But what about answers?

47:08.108 --> 47:10.633
The question Jones asked Smith.

47:10.811 --> 47:12.608
And the response he got. Little Hill?

47:12.779 --> 47:15.441
We know Agent Loeb was infected,
but don't know by whom.

47:15.616 --> 47:19.074
Jones says it wasn't him.
We don't know anything.

47:19.253 --> 47:22.279
You have a problem, Agent Dunham.

47:22.456 --> 47:24.151
You're not easily satisfied.

47:24.324 --> 47:26.315
You want everything
and you want it now.

47:26.493 --> 47:28.984
In your mind, somehow,
a small victory is no victory.

47:29.196 --> 47:32.165
What you did was save a man's life.
That doesn't land for you.

47:32.332 --> 47:34.994
- No, sir...
- I'd tell you to snap the hell out of it.

47:35.202 --> 47:38.501
Stop whining about what you can't
know, can't control, can't change.

47:38.705 --> 47:40.764
I'd tell you to get sleep while you can.

47:40.941 --> 47:43.933
Because tomorrow we'll do this
all over again. And guess what.

47:44.111 --> 47:48.070
You'll have a million new answers
and a million and one new questions.

47:49.416 --> 47:53.182
I would tell you those things,
but I won't.

47:53.353 --> 47:59.314
Because your dissatisfaction
is what makes you so damn good.

47:59.493 --> 48:01.825
Someone I'm proud to say I work with.

48:05.933 --> 48:07.628
Thank you.

48:09.002 --> 48:10.993
Now, go get some sleep
while you can.

48:17.177 --> 48:19.475
Hey. How are you feeling?

48:20.547 --> 48:22.105
I should be asking you that.

48:22.749 --> 48:25.479
- Good job.
- Thank you. You too.

48:26.153 --> 48:27.552
You hungry?

48:27.754 --> 48:30.848
After everything I saw today, no.
Not at all.

48:31.792 --> 48:37.059
- I am thirsty. Really, really thirsty.
- Me too.

48:39.399 --> 48:41.196
Look at that.

48:42.135 --> 48:43.898
Yeah, look at that.

49:00.687 --> 49:05.249
- They're gone.
- So did it work?

49:05.425 --> 49:08.917
- What we did?
- Yes.

49:09.096 --> 49:11.587
It led them back to Mr. Jones.

49:11.798 --> 49:16.235
Did he ask the question?
And did we get the answer?

49:20.340 --> 49:23.741
Little Hill.
